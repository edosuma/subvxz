00:00.300 --> 00:03.850
I found a long, blonde
hair on Simon's scarf.

00:03.900 --> 00:06.670
You followed me? What did
you think I was doing?

00:06.720 --> 00:10.130
I'm pretty sure my husband
is sleeping with someone else.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.690
I'd be nothing without her. She's...

00:12.740 --> 00:14.850
a wonderful mother,

00:14.900 --> 00:16.090
a talented doctor

00:16.140 --> 00:18.540
and not a bad little earner!

00:19.260 --> 00:20.800
GEMMA GASPS

00:22.380 --> 00:26.090
So in sympathy and admiration,

00:26.140 --> 00:28.610
please be upstanding for a toast to Gemma.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.580
ALL: To Gemma!

00:32.420 --> 00:33.970
'Heaven has no rage

00:34.020 --> 00:36.560
'like love to hatred turned...

00:37.180 --> 00:39.570
'Nor hell have a fury

00:39.620 --> 00:41.900
'like the woman scorned.'

01:31.820 --> 01:34.490
There you are! Erm, we ought
to cut the cake, really.

01:34.540 --> 01:36.570
- I thought you'd want
to be there. - Of course.

01:36.620 --> 01:38.960
- Excuse us.
- Yeah, sure.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.840
I'm sorry, I...

01:43.980 --> 01:46.170
I'm sorry, I'm not feeling well.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.730
You've only been here half an hour.

01:47.780 --> 01:50.180
No, I'm not drunk. I just...

01:50.940 --> 01:52.890
I feel sick. I could be
sick. I should go home.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.170
MAN: Come on, you two!

01:54.220 --> 01:56.330
- Yeah, yeah!
- Come on!

01:56.380 --> 01:57.570
Do you want to go now?

01:57.620 --> 01:59.130
I'm really suffering.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.610
Is it serious?

02:00.660 --> 02:03.530
No, I'm sure it'll be fine. I just...

02:04.180 --> 02:06.050
I just want to lie down, really.

02:06.100 --> 02:07.570
After everything you've done?

02:07.620 --> 02:09.560
I'll do it myself!

02:10.259 --> 02:11.930
You carry on.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.410
There's no point in spoiling it all.

02:14.460 --> 02:16.050
I'll take Tom back

02:16.100 --> 02:17.770
so you can enjoy yourself.

02:17.820 --> 02:19.050
Are you sure?

02:19.100 --> 02:20.970
Yeah, absolutely.

02:25.580 --> 02:26.920
Hey...

02:28.380 --> 02:30.920
I meant every word, by the way.

02:38.900 --> 02:41.130
What now? You said we could stay!

02:41.180 --> 02:42.650
I want to go back with Dad.

02:42.700 --> 02:45.060
Mum! Mum!

02:59.500 --> 03:00.730
You broke the mirror.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.050
Yeah.

04:18.740 --> 04:21.220
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

04:35.260 --> 04:40.330
This one girl there, Isobel,
her mum works for Dad.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.090
She said her parents
got divorced last year

04:43.140 --> 04:44.730
and her mum cries all the time.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.010
What?

04:46.060 --> 04:49.260
- She was talking to me about her mum.
- Why are you talking about divorce?

04:50.260 --> 04:51.570
I don't know.

04:51.620 --> 04:54.160
We talked about loads of stuff.

04:55.260 --> 04:57.200
What are you doing?

04:58.060 --> 05:00.210
Making a cup of tea.
Do you want something?

05:00.260 --> 05:01.570
Can I have a Coke?

05:01.620 --> 05:02.610
No.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.800
- Squash?
- Yeah, OK.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.130
I'll bring it up.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.720
OK, thanks.

05:11.380 --> 05:12.720
Tom...

05:14.460 --> 05:16.100
Love you.

06:29.660 --> 06:31.340
SHE SOBS

06:50.980 --> 06:52.720
KNOCKS ON DOOR

06:55.420 --> 06:57.420
What was that noise?

06:59.620 --> 07:02.560
I'm just... throwing a few things away.

07:03.740 --> 07:06.330
Isobel said that, when
the divorce was happening,

07:06.380 --> 07:08.730
she thought she'd have to
live with her dad in Reading.

07:08.780 --> 07:10.810
She said it was horrible.

07:10.860 --> 07:12.690
I don't know.

07:12.740 --> 07:15.010
Good shopping in Reading.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.900
I mean the divorce. The
divorce was horrible.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.770
Tom, what's the matter?
Where's this come from?

07:22.820 --> 07:24.650
- Isobel.
- Has Dad said anything?

07:24.700 --> 07:25.890
Dad?

07:25.940 --> 07:28.210
Is that why you were annoyed?
Have you had an argument?

07:28.260 --> 07:29.490
No.

07:29.540 --> 07:32.130
Mum, if you do get divorced, I
don't want to move. I like it here.

07:32.180 --> 07:34.050
Tom, we're not...

07:39.340 --> 07:41.210
This is your home.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.970
You'll live here as long as you like.

07:44.020 --> 07:45.560
I promise.

07:47.340 --> 07:48.450
OK.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.490
DOORBELL CHIMES

07:50.540 --> 07:52.250
- Was that Dad?
- It's a bit early.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.490
Maybe he's drunk.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.480
Oh, don't be silly.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.090
I've never seen you
drive like that before.

08:17.140 --> 08:18.540
I'm ill.

08:19.180 --> 08:21.320
Can I... Can I come in?

08:30.940 --> 08:32.880
Is... Tom upstairs?

08:33.700 --> 08:35.690
I'm having a rum and Coke. You?

08:35.740 --> 08:37.530
No, no, I'm fine.

08:37.580 --> 08:39.919
Erm, is that Simon's stuff?

08:52.460 --> 08:54.660
How long have you known?

08:55.300 --> 08:57.250
What? Known what?

08:57.300 --> 09:00.100
I found his other phone in the boot.

09:01.460 --> 09:04.050
Pictures of them together. Your texts.

09:04.100 --> 09:07.930
You need to be honest with me now
before I really get fucked off.

09:07.980 --> 09:10.180
How long have you known?

09:11.020 --> 09:12.770
Oh, God, Gemma...

09:12.820 --> 09:14.090
Yeah.

09:17.100 --> 09:18.530
Did you tell him?

09:18.580 --> 09:21.520
I haven't said anything except I'm ill.

09:23.460 --> 09:24.970
Answer my question.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.010
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

09:26.060 --> 09:27.660
Well, erm...

09:28.820 --> 09:30.810
.. he came in with something maybe...

09:30.860 --> 09:33.010
- maybe four weeks ago.
- Four weeks?

09:33.060 --> 09:34.410
I thought it might be an STI,

09:34.460 --> 09:37.290
so I asked him about sexual partners.

09:37.340 --> 09:40.090
- Today just gets better and
better(!) - Oh, no, it's OK.

09:40.140 --> 09:41.690
In the end, it was fine.

09:41.740 --> 09:44.570
It's just that, when I asked him
the question, he paused and...

09:44.620 --> 09:45.970
so I guessed.

09:46.020 --> 09:47.290
And since then,

09:47.340 --> 09:50.850
I have been telling him every week,

09:50.900 --> 09:52.450
texting him,

09:52.500 --> 09:55.040
"You deal with this or I will."

09:56.140 --> 09:57.690
Oh, I am so sorry!

09:57.740 --> 09:59.570
- Can I give you a...
- What?

09:59.620 --> 10:01.570
- A hug?
- No.

10:01.620 --> 10:03.890
I don't know who you are.

10:04.620 --> 10:07.090
Neil. Anna. His assistant.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.210
You. Who else?

10:09.260 --> 10:12.810
If that's who was on the
phone, that's probably it.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.450
Her parents, presumably?

10:14.500 --> 10:16.490
- I don't know.
- Why didn't you tell me?

10:16.540 --> 10:19.250
And don't say it's because
you didn't want to take sides.

10:19.300 --> 10:23.220
- Well, technically, I'm not allowed to tell you
anything. He's my patient. - He's my husband!

10:26.020 --> 10:29.260
I thought it would be better
if he told you himself.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.820
He promised me he would.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.850
How long has it been going on?

10:38.900 --> 10:40.770
Well, I'm not... I'm not sure.

10:40.820 --> 10:43.420
No, you've asked. He's told you.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.610
Three months.

10:45.660 --> 10:47.650
I'm sure it's not serious.

10:47.700 --> 10:50.170
I mean, it's serious for you.

10:51.620 --> 10:53.530
You warned him,

10:53.580 --> 10:55.930
yesterday, when I talked
about the blonde hair.

10:55.980 --> 10:57.570
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.

10:57.620 --> 10:59.360
You should be.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.490
- Gemma, please...
- No!

11:08.540 --> 11:10.210
Anyway, I've decided.

11:10.260 --> 11:13.500
When Simon gets back, he'll move out.

11:14.620 --> 11:16.360
What, forever?

11:16.980 --> 11:20.700
Because, I mean, it's
probably just sex, isn't it?

11:22.260 --> 11:24.010
A midlife crisis?

11:24.060 --> 11:26.650
He probably knows he's made a
mistake, still loves you and...

11:26.700 --> 11:27.890
Whose side are you on?

11:27.940 --> 11:29.410
I don't want to be on a side.

11:29.460 --> 11:31.130
Wrong answer!

11:32.660 --> 11:34.000
Yours.

11:37.180 --> 11:39.250
Go back to the party.

11:39.580 --> 11:42.170
He should have a good time
and really enjoy himself.

11:42.220 --> 11:45.690
- I don't think... - Don't tell
him that there's anything wrong.

11:45.740 --> 11:49.130
I want him to come in
and see those suitcases

11:49.180 --> 11:52.250
and understand in that second...

11:52.300 --> 11:54.690
exactly what he's lost.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.250
I'd like to stay here with you.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.970
- No.
- I...

11:58.020 --> 12:00.290
don't think that you
should be on your own.

12:00.340 --> 12:02.650
I think, if you want
us to stay as friends,

12:02.700 --> 12:04.810
you should do exactly as you're told.

12:04.860 --> 12:06.420
Of course.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.860
CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE

13:38.620 --> 13:40.140
Hi.

13:46.460 --> 13:49.260
SIMON URINATES

13:52.860 --> 13:55.000
URINE SPLASHES ON FLOOR

13:57.620 --> 14:00.060
HE CONTINUES TO URINATE

14:02.460 --> 14:04.740
BELT BEING BUCKLED

14:07.700 --> 14:10.170
I loved that. It was amazing.

14:10.260 --> 14:11.570
The... party.

14:11.620 --> 14:13.250
Not the piss.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.650
- Simon... - You should
be in bed. You're ill.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.700
- I couldn't sleep.
- I'm really tired.

14:18.940 --> 14:20.330
Sorry! Sorry! Drunk.

14:20.380 --> 14:21.720
Drunk.

14:31.540 --> 14:34.340
Can you bring some water up, please?

14:45.540 --> 14:47.740
SIMON SNORES GENTLY

15:55.140 --> 15:57.940
MOBILE PHONE ALARM SOUNDS

16:00.540 --> 16:03.260
ALARM CONTINUES

16:13.540 --> 16:15.680
HE TURNS THE ALARM OFF

16:39.620 --> 16:40.890
Morning.

16:40.940 --> 16:42.770
I forgot to turn off the alarm.

16:42.820 --> 16:46.120
It's a good job you
didn't. You need to be up.

16:46.260 --> 16:47.820
Why?

16:51.060 --> 16:52.600
Right! Yes!

16:53.740 --> 16:57.330
Tour of the ground, meet the
players. Are you excited?

16:57.380 --> 16:59.920
Dad, were you drunk last night?

17:00.940 --> 17:03.730
Don't know what you're talking
about, mate. I didn't touch a drop.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.369
How are you?

17:05.420 --> 17:06.690
Better.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.210
What was it?

17:08.260 --> 17:09.369
What?

17:09.420 --> 17:11.410
You didn't feel well.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.130
I don't know.

17:13.180 --> 17:15.720
Just had a pain in my stomach.

17:16.140 --> 17:19.250
- You should get it checked out.
- Yeah, I will, if it carries on.

17:19.300 --> 17:21.170
Enjoy it.

17:21.220 --> 17:22.810
- Yeah, I will.
- Bye!

17:22.859 --> 17:24.400
Ah! Ah! Ah!

17:35.420 --> 17:37.760
Was I all right last night?

17:39.100 --> 17:41.170
Were you "all right"?

17:41.660 --> 17:44.210
- I didn't say anything to upset you?
- You didn't have a chance.

17:44.260 --> 17:47.210
You came in, went to the
loo, then passed out.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.490
Sorry.

17:48.540 --> 17:49.610
Don't be.

17:49.660 --> 17:53.010
It was your birthday. You're
supposed to have a good time.

17:53.060 --> 17:54.400
Thanks.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.440
Your wing mirror's off.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.090
Yeah.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.770
What happened to you last night?

18:08.820 --> 18:10.930
You hit the champagne a bit hard?

18:10.980 --> 18:13.210
- I know what you doctors
are like! - I was ill.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.370
But...

18:14.420 --> 18:16.420
better this morning?

18:17.380 --> 18:19.520
I'm... I'm in a hurry.

18:26.340 --> 18:29.370
'Gem, seriously... now that
you know, you can't just...

18:29.420 --> 18:32.330
They're going to Villa Park to see a game.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.970
A... A special tour.

18:35.020 --> 18:37.130
Tom won it in a school raffle, so...

18:37.180 --> 18:39.520
Gem, you need to tell him.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.290
He's been looking forward to it.

18:42.340 --> 18:45.490
So, update on this morning --
Locum's here. So is Dr Barton.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.570
Dr Mitchel's ill. And Jack...

18:47.620 --> 18:49.210
Jack doesn't work here any more.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.450
- He left a message saying he
was going to sue. - What for?

18:51.500 --> 18:53.290
- He sounded drunk.
- My computer's packed up.

18:53.340 --> 18:54.810
Already?

18:54.860 --> 18:56.450
- That has to be a record.
- Morning!

18:56.500 --> 18:59.370
- Call the man, check it's not the
whole system. - It's the whole system.

18:59.420 --> 19:01.760
God, this place is a joke.

19:03.660 --> 19:04.930
Sorry.

19:04.980 --> 19:06.850
Let's just start.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.730
- Doctor...
- Anwar Shamsi?

19:12.780 --> 19:13.970
- Yeah.
- Hi.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.930
- Doctor, it's urgent. - Gordon,
we have to stick to appointments.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.930
Mr Shamsi, if you'd like to come with...

19:18.980 --> 19:20.780
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:23.060 --> 19:25.200
I'm sorry, should I...?

19:25.700 --> 19:28.040
Could you give me a second?

19:32.660 --> 19:35.170
What is she doing here? Is
she here to confront me?

19:35.220 --> 19:37.930
No, I've just seen, she's on my
list. It's a normal appointment.

19:37.980 --> 19:41.280
She booked it a couple
of days ago. Come here.

19:41.660 --> 19:45.090
This is hard. I'm good at keeping
my head together, but today...

19:45.140 --> 19:47.480
- Talk to Simon.
- I will.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.730
But before I do, I need the facts.

19:49.780 --> 19:51.090
What is this relationship?

19:51.140 --> 19:53.250
- I mean, three months,
is it a fling? - Yes.

19:53.300 --> 19:57.170
- He's never suggested it's
anything... - What about her?

19:57.220 --> 19:59.420
What does he see in her?

20:01.580 --> 20:03.250
Apart from...

20:06.420 --> 20:09.160
Gemma, wait! Stop. What are you...?

20:09.860 --> 20:11.530
Kate Parks?

20:11.580 --> 20:12.970
If you can come with me?

20:13.020 --> 20:15.050
- Sorry, I thought...
- I'm here to see Dr Mahendra.

20:15.100 --> 20:17.330
Dr Mahendra has too
many appointments today.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.290
Mr Shamsi, if you can wait five minutes?

20:19.340 --> 20:21.050
Kate, you don't mind swapping, do you?

20:21.100 --> 20:24.040
It speeds things up for everyone else.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.040
Thanks.

20:32.460 --> 20:34.730
So, Kate, how can I help?

20:35.980 --> 20:38.530
Er, I've been feeling tired
recently, like a cold,

20:38.580 --> 20:39.730
and it's not going away.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.890
How long?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.170
Couple of weeks.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.760
All right.

20:44.500 --> 20:47.770
So, if you take off your top
and trousers, we'll have a look.

20:47.820 --> 20:51.720
- Top and trousers? Why do I
need...? - To examine you.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.330
You're in good shape.

21:17.380 --> 21:19.650
I'm heading to the gym.
I go every morning.

21:19.700 --> 21:20.890
I've got a trainer.

21:20.940 --> 21:22.610
Sounds wonderful.

21:22.660 --> 21:24.090
You should try it.

21:24.140 --> 21:25.850
Maybe I will.

21:25.900 --> 21:28.700
You just lie on here for me, please.

21:39.220 --> 21:42.210
So you work at your dad's restaurant?

21:42.260 --> 21:43.730
Sometimes.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.170
Just for a bit of money, but I'd rather...

21:46.220 --> 21:47.490
Ouch.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.970
Does that hurt?

21:49.020 --> 21:50.130
No.

21:50.180 --> 21:51.690
All right.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.340
- How about... this?
- Ow! Yep.

21:55.380 --> 21:59.490
- Mm. - Yep. - It's a little
tender. It's probably nothing.

21:59.540 --> 22:02.770
But to be sure, I'm just going
to get some blood samples.

22:02.820 --> 22:05.160
Doesn't the nurse do that?

22:06.140 --> 22:07.810
I don't mind.

22:09.820 --> 22:12.210
I need to ask you a few
standard questions.

22:12.260 --> 22:13.530
OK.

22:13.580 --> 22:15.770
How much do you drink on average?

22:15.820 --> 22:17.850
Couple of glasses of wine.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.610
- A night?
- A week.

22:19.660 --> 22:22.330
- And do you smoke?
- No. Ah...!

22:23.220 --> 22:24.890
Sexual partners?

22:24.940 --> 22:26.290
Sorry?

22:26.340 --> 22:29.410
I'm just trying to rule a few things out.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.010
Do you have any sexual partners?

22:31.060 --> 22:32.420
One.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.970
I don't tend to sleep around.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.490
- Are you having sex regularly? - Erm...

22:38.540 --> 22:39.890
Not enough.

22:39.940 --> 22:42.380
- He's married.
- He...?

22:43.860 --> 22:46.060
- Right.
- But unhappy.

22:46.940 --> 22:49.280
Though it's sad, actually.

22:50.700 --> 22:53.440
Why doesn't he just leave his wife?

22:53.660 --> 22:55.600
Family, I suppose.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.490
But the wife doesn't suspect?

22:58.540 --> 23:00.080
Not a clue.

23:02.500 --> 23:04.250
Hm...

23:04.300 --> 23:06.240
Sounds complicated.

23:06.620 --> 23:08.690
You can put your clothes on now.

23:08.740 --> 23:10.810
You seem fine.

23:10.860 --> 23:13.010
I hope you don't mind all the questions,

23:13.060 --> 23:16.140
but it helps to get a picture
and you seem very healthy.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.050
Just in case, could you pop next door,

23:23.100 --> 23:25.410
pee in that and bring it back?

23:25.460 --> 23:27.330
Yeah. No problem.

23:40.020 --> 23:41.860
DOOR OPENS

23:42.900 --> 23:44.500
Excuse me.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.140
SHE SIGHS HEAVILY

24:41.660 --> 24:43.530
This'll just take a minute.

24:43.580 --> 24:46.680
We'll do the bloods, see what comes back.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.090
It's probably just a cold.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.090
In the meantime,

24:52.140 --> 24:55.050
take it easy and avoid doing
anything strenuous or stressful.

24:55.100 --> 24:56.850
What are the bloods for?

24:56.900 --> 24:58.570
Measures all sorts.

24:58.620 --> 25:00.010
Iron, sugar...

25:00.060 --> 25:01.530
And that one?

25:01.580 --> 25:03.650
Oh, this is just a...

25:09.580 --> 25:11.700
What? What is it?

25:15.540 --> 25:16.890
Kate...

25:16.940 --> 25:19.010
are you having unprotected sex?

25:19.060 --> 25:20.330
Erm...

25:20.380 --> 25:21.530
No.

25:21.580 --> 25:23.610
Have you been trying for a child?

25:23.660 --> 25:25.010
What are you talking about?

25:25.060 --> 25:26.690
Two lines means it's positive.

25:26.740 --> 25:28.850
- Sorry, are you saying I'm...? - Yes.

25:28.900 --> 25:30.700
You're pregnant.

25:39.180 --> 25:41.450
I assume the father is...

25:43.780 --> 25:45.380
.. this man.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.880
It's a lot to take in, I know.

25:59.500 --> 26:03.930
You'll want to consider the
stability of this... relationship.

26:03.980 --> 26:06.120
Can I see Dr Mahendra?

26:06.300 --> 26:08.050
She is my doctor and this is a shock.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.370
So can I see her instead?

26:10.940 --> 26:12.580
Please?

26:20.980 --> 26:23.120
I'll let you know. OK?

26:46.260 --> 26:47.370
- OK...
- Excuse me.

26:47.420 --> 26:48.770
Gordon, just wait. You're next.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.490
Anwar Shamsi?

26:52.220 --> 26:54.490
- Anwar?
- He just left.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.140
Really?

27:00.580 --> 27:02.120
Mr Shamsi!

27:03.060 --> 27:04.200
Hi.

27:05.300 --> 27:08.210
Well, I'm a solicitor with a
client that needs me urgently.

27:08.260 --> 27:11.810
Your receptionist said, if I had the first
appointment of the day, I'd be straight in.

27:11.860 --> 27:14.730
I'm so sorry. I hope she
explained, there's no guarantees.

27:14.780 --> 27:16.290
I'm having quite a morning.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.010
Why have you come out here?

27:18.060 --> 27:19.330
That's not normal.

27:19.380 --> 27:22.130
Because men your age don't tend
to see doctors when you should,

27:22.180 --> 27:25.370
and you look extremely worried,
so I'm not going to let you leave

27:25.420 --> 27:27.960
until you tell me the problem.

27:29.340 --> 27:32.340
I'm often sick first
thing in the mornings.

27:32.620 --> 27:33.890
Mm-hm.

27:33.940 --> 27:35.280
Often?

27:36.180 --> 27:38.490
Yeah, every few days. What,
are we going to do this here?

27:38.540 --> 27:41.140
Yeah, yeah. You drink a lot?

27:42.650 --> 27:43.650
Not usually.

27:43.700 --> 27:44.970
Look forward.

27:45.020 --> 27:48.010
Recently, I can't sleep. I
worry about things. So, yeah...

27:48.060 --> 27:49.450
I have a drink.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.450
Your eyes are a little bloodshot.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.250
I take it you've googled your symptoms?

27:53.300 --> 27:54.890
Er, yeah.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.140
And?

27:56.980 --> 28:01.290
Well, it says... being sick like
that first thing in the mornings

28:01.340 --> 28:04.210
could be a warning of a brain tumour.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.410
Yeah.

28:06.460 --> 28:10.690
That's possible. But there are
many more likely explanations.

28:10.740 --> 28:13.810
Tummy bug, virus or
your late-night drinking.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.890
So it doesn't suggest
anything to do with the brain?

28:16.940 --> 28:19.480
Not unless there's more to say.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.570
Are you sure you don't want
to come in for a moment?

28:23.620 --> 28:27.020
No, if you think it's
nothing, then I should go.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.280
Thank you.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.890
So, she's not going to keep it

28:50.940 --> 28:53.810
and she doesn't want anybody to know.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.530
- Not Simon?
- No.

28:55.580 --> 28:58.250
She's going to find somewhere
they'll do it as soon as possible.

28:58.300 --> 29:00.090
Isn't she worried that I might tell him?

29:00.140 --> 29:01.130
Well, why would you?

29:01.180 --> 29:04.880
I mean, as far as she's
concerned, you're oblivious.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.650
But... Simon.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.330
He should know she's pregnant.

29:18.380 --> 29:19.570
What?

29:19.620 --> 29:21.210
- Gemma...
- He'd want to know.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.360
Do you want to make things work with him?

29:25.060 --> 29:28.780
Because, if she ends up with
his baby, then forget it.

29:29.900 --> 29:33.650
Her and this child are going
to be in your life forever.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.650
You don't have to tell him.

29:35.700 --> 29:37.090
It's better for him if you don't.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.330
Besides, according to the
General Medical Council

29:39.380 --> 29:41.130
and every professional standard,

29:41.180 --> 29:42.370
you're not allowed to.

29:42.420 --> 29:46.780
So be quiet for the next
24 hours and let it happen.

29:47.940 --> 29:51.640
Then talk to your husband
and sort out your marriage.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.170
And this girl is a fling.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.530
You're not.

29:56.580 --> 29:58.340
Don't tell him.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.690
We had to take penalties

30:06.740 --> 30:08.650
and when I took mine,

30:08.700 --> 30:10.370
I fell over.

30:10.420 --> 30:11.930
He was really serious.

30:11.980 --> 30:13.970
He did this long run-up
and then he just...

30:14.020 --> 30:15.530
Yeah, all right. Thanks, mate.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.770
How did you do?

30:16.820 --> 30:18.010
Erm, I scored.

30:18.060 --> 30:20.850
- No! Did you? - Yeah, and
he was a professional keeper.

30:20.900 --> 30:23.330
Tom was really good, actually.
They said he was the best.

30:23.380 --> 30:24.690
Oh, well done!

30:24.740 --> 30:27.540
I am so pleased you had a good time.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.180
Yeah.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.010
How was work?

30:34.060 --> 30:35.090
A mess.

30:35.140 --> 30:36.340
Why?

30:37.420 --> 30:39.820
Just appointments, you know?

30:41.460 --> 30:44.560
You all right, though? You feeling better?

30:45.900 --> 30:47.370
Yeah.

30:47.420 --> 30:48.900
Good.

30:50.380 --> 30:52.090
You should come next time, Mum.

30:52.140 --> 30:55.970
Watch him have another turn.
You'd find it really funny.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.970
- Dad, that missed.
- Yeah, all right!

30:58.020 --> 31:00.010
Next weekend, we'll find a goal,

31:00.060 --> 31:02.250
we'll do penalties and settle this.

31:02.300 --> 31:05.240
Er, can you deal with the humiliation?

31:40.780 --> 31:43.130
- He's just like all of them.
- What do you mean?

31:43.180 --> 31:44.570
- It's what men are like.
- Really?

31:44.620 --> 31:47.010
Yeah. It's been proven statistically.

31:47.060 --> 31:50.130
Men all fancy 22-year-old women.

31:50.180 --> 31:52.970
Doesn't matter how old they are themselves

31:53.020 --> 31:56.330
or what they say, that's just
who they're after, sexually.

31:56.380 --> 31:58.530
They might happen to like
their partner as well

31:58.580 --> 32:00.530
but, biologically,

32:00.580 --> 32:03.520
22 and fertile is what it's all about.

32:05.140 --> 32:08.740
He's just had a hot summer and
messed it up. He'll come back.

32:09.940 --> 32:12.010
I mean, you love him, don't you?

32:12.060 --> 32:14.690
When it's done and she's
got rid of the baby,

32:14.740 --> 32:16.090
give him hell

32:16.140 --> 32:18.280
and then let him back.

32:19.140 --> 32:21.570
I shouldn't tell him?
Give him a chance to...

32:21.620 --> 32:23.090
Tell him?

32:25.940 --> 32:28.090
You're sort of innocent
sometimes, aren't you?

32:28.140 --> 32:29.690
I mean, you're not. Clearly.

32:29.740 --> 32:32.740
But you think the world's
better than it is.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.460
Yes.

32:46.140 --> 32:47.690
I'll join you.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.460
OK.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.130
Hi.

32:56.180 --> 32:58.780
- Hi... - What are you drinking?

33:00.180 --> 33:03.120
- Beck's. - Beck's and a rum and Coke.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.050
I thought when you said you had a
drink in the middle of the night,

33:06.100 --> 33:08.440
you meant in your kitchen.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.450
Why are you here?

33:12.500 --> 33:14.450
Well, it's Saturday night, Anwar,

33:14.500 --> 33:17.440
and, as you can see, I'm a party girl.

33:19.140 --> 33:21.410
I couldn't sleep, either.

33:22.100 --> 33:23.690
Why not?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.450
Got a lot going on.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.700
- Like what?
- At home.

33:29.660 --> 33:30.930
Doesn't matter.

33:30.980 --> 33:32.920
Tell me about you.

33:33.860 --> 33:37.610
You were holding something
back this morning, weren't you?

33:37.660 --> 33:40.130
Something you weren't saying.

33:41.780 --> 33:43.970
I'm married.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.050
OK.

33:45.100 --> 33:46.770
Alesha's six months pregnant.

33:46.820 --> 33:48.730
Congratulations.

33:48.780 --> 33:51.780
Five years ago, I had this... dizziness.

33:54.220 --> 33:58.060
They eventually did a scan and
found a tumour, in my brain.

33:59.380 --> 34:00.770
Couldn't operate.

34:00.820 --> 34:03.370
Said it wasn't doing
any harm at that point,

34:03.420 --> 34:05.050
but it was growing

34:05.100 --> 34:07.900
and that, one day, it would kill me.

34:08.940 --> 34:10.330
I'm sorry.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.179
I should've told Alesha at the time.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.290
- I just didn't want to scare
her away. - She doesn't know?

34:17.340 --> 34:21.810
If I tell her now, she'll ask why
did you make all these promises,

34:21.860 --> 34:23.730
start a family, all this time...?

34:23.780 --> 34:25.210
Go for another scan.

34:25.260 --> 34:28.770
I came in because it'd be good
to know if the symptoms fit.

34:28.820 --> 34:30.170
Is this it?

34:30.219 --> 34:31.650
You didn't tell me your history.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.050
What do you think now?

34:33.100 --> 34:34.330
I can't be sure.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.380
Well, can you guess?

34:37.219 --> 34:39.650
The symptoms fit. Talk to your wife.

34:39.699 --> 34:41.040
Right.

34:41.780 --> 34:43.850
There's two things.

34:43.900 --> 34:46.690
There's the mistake and then
there's the lie to cover it up,

34:46.739 --> 34:50.940
- and the mistake is a lot
easier to forgive. - You reckon?

34:51.020 --> 34:52.290
I know.

34:52.340 --> 34:54.449
If I tell her, that'll be it.

34:54.500 --> 34:55.929
She'll find out eventually.

34:55.980 --> 34:57.490
She'll see it in your notes.

34:57.540 --> 35:01.810
- Medical records are confidential.
- Not the medical records.

35:01.860 --> 35:03.660
The post mortem.

35:05.540 --> 35:07.880
Sorry, but you married her.

35:09.180 --> 35:11.320
You've made a promise.

35:23.380 --> 35:25.180
Trouble at home.

35:26.300 --> 35:28.410
Something's happened with your husband.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.610
That's what normally sends
women your age to a bar

35:30.660 --> 35:33.330
in the middle of the night, yeah?

35:33.660 --> 35:35.490
- Yeah. - See, I do a lot of divorce

35:35.540 --> 35:38.650
and you should know that a
woman might get the house,

35:38.700 --> 35:40.290
the assets, the children,

35:40.340 --> 35:42.290
but that doesn't mean that she's won.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.650
Because, a few years later,
he's with someone new,

35:44.700 --> 35:46.930
making lots of money,
no real responsibility.

35:46.980 --> 35:49.090
But she is struggling.

35:49.140 --> 35:52.490
Kids, work, no time to move on.

35:52.540 --> 35:55.330
We've all got problems
that we can't solve.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.650
Tell your wife the truth.

36:00.980 --> 36:02.420
I can't.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.370
Hey, we've got to go.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.020
OK.

36:43.580 --> 36:45.520
MOBILE PHONE RINGS

36:46.900 --> 36:49.040
PHONE CONTINUES TO RING

36:58.900 --> 37:00.530
THEY LAUGH

37:00.580 --> 37:02.290
I'm this way.

37:02.340 --> 37:04.080
Erm, how much?

37:05.100 --> 37:06.970
Ah, it doesn't matter.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.560
No, go on.

37:11.540 --> 37:14.540
7 for the cigarettes,
2.50 for the lighter.

37:14.940 --> 37:16.480
Thank you.

37:17.620 --> 37:20.130
You'll be all right getting back?

37:20.180 --> 37:21.890
Who says I'm going back?

37:21.940 --> 37:23.820
SHE LAUGHS

37:24.940 --> 37:26.810
Be careful, yeah?

37:27.540 --> 37:28.880
Night.

37:46.820 --> 37:48.700
Hey...

37:50.060 --> 37:51.730
Want a drink?

37:51.780 --> 37:53.220
Ah...

37:55.980 --> 37:57.970
Urgh, what's going on in there?

37:58.020 --> 37:59.820
Shower's broken.

38:02.540 --> 38:04.140
No milk.

38:06.100 --> 38:08.100
Fridge doesn't work.

38:10.580 --> 38:13.050
Your flat's a shithole, Jack.

38:14.740 --> 38:17.280
You're very welcome to go home.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.730
When we first moved here,

38:20.780 --> 38:23.210
you and David had us over for
dinner and looked after us.

38:23.260 --> 38:25.450
- You remember?
- Yeah.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.250
David's missed.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.060
As you can see.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.640
How long were you together?

38:36.980 --> 38:38.330
Oh...

38:38.380 --> 38:39.850
30 years.

38:41.660 --> 38:44.060
- Did you ever cheat?
- No.

38:45.540 --> 38:46.890
Did he?

38:46.940 --> 38:49.480
There's something in your head.

38:50.940 --> 38:52.530
Can you keep a secret?

38:52.580 --> 38:55.090
CHUCKLING: Don't be ridiculous,
Gemma. I'm an alcoholic.

38:55.140 --> 38:57.680
Of course I can keep a secret.

39:01.420 --> 39:04.520
Simon's been sleeping with another woman.

39:04.980 --> 39:06.980
Oh, I'm sorry.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.850
Are you two...?

39:10.900 --> 39:13.440
I haven't told him that I know.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.180
Why not?

39:16.220 --> 39:18.530
Because I'm not that woman

39:18.580 --> 39:21.420
that gets cheated on and...

39:22.660 --> 39:25.570
.. finds out and has screaming rows.

39:25.620 --> 39:27.410
And I'm not...

39:27.460 --> 39:30.540
maintenance and divorce
and all that stuff.

39:33.660 --> 39:35.410
I'm better than that.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.970
I'm clever.

39:37.020 --> 39:39.010
Yeah, and, er...

39:39.060 --> 39:42.770
I'm not a pissed widower who
hasn't showered in three weeks.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.620
I'm clever, too.

39:45.620 --> 39:47.690
Doesn't mean a thing.

39:50.460 --> 39:52.890
She came to the surgery
today, this other woman,

39:52.940 --> 39:54.410
and I did some tests.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.250
Turns out she's pregnant.

39:56.300 --> 39:59.210
She's decided to have an
abortion and not tell anyone.

39:59.260 --> 40:00.690
She went to see you?

40:00.740 --> 40:03.740
I told her I was the
only doctor available.

40:05.700 --> 40:07.370
Be careful...

40:08.460 --> 40:09.780
Yeah.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.440
I'm not entirely surprised.

40:14.020 --> 40:17.170
In his 20s, Simon used to sleep around.

40:17.220 --> 40:18.890
Always in the Crown.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.290
Different girl every other week.

40:21.340 --> 40:22.490
Simon?

40:22.540 --> 40:24.810
Then when he came back
from London with you,

40:24.860 --> 40:26.570
we all thought he'd grown up.

40:26.620 --> 40:29.050
No-one's ever told me that before.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.690
Well, they wouldn't.

40:30.740 --> 40:34.450
His dad cheated on his mum, didn't he?

40:34.500 --> 40:36.130
Left her.

40:36.180 --> 40:37.530
Yeah.

40:37.580 --> 40:39.580
My dad loved Scotch.

40:40.620 --> 40:42.980
Sons are their fathers.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.080
I hope not.

40:56.060 --> 40:59.000
Three weeks, you couldn't use the sink?

40:59.740 --> 41:01.490
Look, while it's been lovely

41:01.540 --> 41:05.570
to be dragged home by someone who's
actually more depressed than myself,

41:05.620 --> 41:07.730
maybe we should call it a night?

41:07.780 --> 41:09.050
Urgh!

41:09.900 --> 41:11.490
- Click!
- What's wrong?

41:11.540 --> 41:12.650
Gout.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.800
Diagnosed by me. You don't need to see it.

41:16.300 --> 41:17.530
I'm going to bed.

41:17.580 --> 41:19.850
You can't live like this.

41:22.860 --> 41:25.210
You should tell him you know.

41:25.260 --> 41:27.490
Tell him she's pregnant.

41:27.540 --> 41:29.010
I'm not ethically allowed to.

41:29.060 --> 41:30.810
Tell him all of it.

41:30.860 --> 41:33.010
Then... take your son and leave.

41:33.060 --> 41:34.660
Start again.

41:35.540 --> 41:37.090
It's just a fling. It doesn't...

41:37.140 --> 41:38.930
It doesn't mean he won't do it again.

41:38.980 --> 41:42.730
Look, he's lived here all his
life. You don't need to stay.

41:42.780 --> 41:46.370
Sometimes, it's the
place that's the problem.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.740
Hm?

42:39.580 --> 42:41.740
MOBILE PHONE BEEPS

43:08.900 --> 43:12.100
I woke up this morning
and you weren't there.

43:13.340 --> 43:16.280
I came down to work. I couldn't sleep.

43:18.100 --> 43:20.300
I was dead to the world.

43:22.380 --> 43:24.170
Weeks are long at the moment.

43:24.220 --> 43:27.290
I know that's always true for you, but...

43:27.340 --> 43:31.330
.. we start the build in a week,
so it's full on, you know?

43:31.380 --> 43:34.650
And all that running
around with Tom yesterday...

43:34.700 --> 43:36.900
You're having an affair.

43:40.260 --> 43:41.800
Aren't you?

43:47.300 --> 43:49.300
I'm convinced of it.

43:50.500 --> 43:52.370
You're convinced?

43:55.500 --> 43:56.770
OK...

43:57.660 --> 44:00.600
There would be two things, if you were.

44:01.940 --> 44:04.170
There would be the relationship itself.

44:04.220 --> 44:06.290
The sex, all of that.

44:06.740 --> 44:08.690
- And then there would
be the lie. - Gem...

44:08.740 --> 44:09.940
I...

44:12.460 --> 44:14.410
I think that I...

44:14.460 --> 44:16.290
could accept the relationship,

44:16.340 --> 44:18.010
eventually...

44:19.420 --> 44:21.760
.. if you put an end to it.

44:24.780 --> 44:28.250
We said, when we got married,
that there would probably be

44:28.300 --> 44:30.450
other people that we
fancied over a lifetime.

44:30.500 --> 44:33.040
Yep, yep. Yes, we did say that.

44:33.220 --> 44:36.130
So the lie would be the bigger problem.

44:36.180 --> 44:37.490
If you'd been with someone else

44:37.540 --> 44:39.290
and you didn't just come out and tell me,

44:39.340 --> 44:42.130
then that would be the real betrayal.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.980
Don't you think?

44:46.940 --> 44:50.260
And I don't want to prove it.
I don't want to catch you.

44:51.460 --> 44:53.770
I want you to be honest.

44:53.820 --> 44:55.010
Unprompted.

44:55.060 --> 44:56.860
To just tell me.

44:58.620 --> 45:01.360
To say, "Yes. I'm sorry. But, yes."

45:02.860 --> 45:05.600
"I have been seeing someone else."

45:07.660 --> 45:09.060
You can.

45:10.380 --> 45:11.920
And then...

45:13.940 --> 45:17.300
.. all of the consequences, we
can talk about all of it together.

45:20.540 --> 45:22.450
But that'd be hard, but it'll be better.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.240
For both of us.

45:26.380 --> 45:27.920
Because...

45:29.340 --> 45:31.080
.. actually...

45:34.620 --> 45:37.220
.. even if you have done this...

45:40.740 --> 45:43.480
.. I think I still really love you.

46:02.540 --> 46:03.930
I'm not.

46:03.980 --> 46:06.900
SHE SOBS

46:12.420 --> 46:14.690
Where has this come from?

46:15.460 --> 46:16.800
You...

46:17.460 --> 46:19.570
You follow me to Mum's and now this.

46:19.620 --> 46:21.410
Why would you suddenly think...?

46:21.460 --> 46:22.860
It's OK.

46:30.020 --> 46:33.820
It doesn't matter. You've
said you're not. You're not.

46:40.860 --> 46:43.860
You really think I could do that to you?

46:45.580 --> 46:47.720
It's working too hard.

46:50.140 --> 46:51.680
Yeah. Work.

46:53.740 --> 46:55.010
That's it.

46:55.060 --> 46:56.600
Excuse me.

46:57.860 --> 46:59.930
Hey, Tom. Sleep well?

47:00.940 --> 47:02.370
Cereal's there, love.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.170
You want toast?

47:04.220 --> 47:05.780
Sure?

47:13.980 --> 47:15.930
- Morning!
- Hi!

47:15.980 --> 47:19.250
Fancy a drive? It's got
wing mirrors and everything!

47:19.300 --> 47:21.100
Leave her alone!

48:08.260 --> 48:10.650
My two alarms go off at 7.30

48:10.700 --> 48:13.050
and then a woman arrives at my door,

48:13.100 --> 48:15.650
pushes in, starts packing my bag.

48:15.700 --> 48:19.650
Informs me her name is Casey
and there's a taxi waiting.

48:19.700 --> 48:21.010
Carly.

48:21.060 --> 48:23.930
She tells me, if I don't get in it,
Gemma Foster will have me arrested.

48:23.980 --> 48:26.090
Practising medicine while
under the influence.

48:26.140 --> 48:28.450
Plenty of evidence, if I need it.

48:28.500 --> 48:30.700
You're going on holiday.

48:31.380 --> 48:33.090
I can't afford a holiday.

48:33.140 --> 48:35.770
All expenses paid. Out and open return,

48:35.820 --> 48:37.450
but stay there a while.

48:37.500 --> 48:40.290
Your train will be here in a minute.

48:40.340 --> 48:42.480
I'm not going anywhere.

48:43.180 --> 48:45.520
I found these in your flat.

48:45.900 --> 48:46.970
Sleeping pills.

48:47.020 --> 48:48.970
- Yes. - And these to stop the vomiting.

48:49.020 --> 48:50.610
But I didn't go through with it.

48:50.660 --> 48:53.450
But you kept the pills, in
case you changed your mind.

48:53.500 --> 48:56.540
This is an intervention,
Jack, so trust me.

48:58.500 --> 49:01.600
Sometimes it's the place
that's the problem.

49:02.980 --> 49:05.650
You'll be met when you get there.

49:09.820 --> 49:11.220
By whom?

49:12.260 --> 49:13.650
Mary.

49:13.700 --> 49:15.170
Mary who?

49:15.980 --> 49:17.720
She's a friend.

49:25.580 --> 49:27.980
What happened with the girl?

49:28.540 --> 49:30.530
What are they going to do?

49:30.580 --> 49:32.720
- No.
- You told him?

49:33.700 --> 49:36.040
He doesn't deserve to know.

49:53.820 --> 49:55.290
A friend?

49:57.100 --> 49:59.300
I think you'll like her.

50:00.300 --> 50:01.840
You're mad.

50:25.500 --> 50:27.250
It's a bit nicer today.

50:27.300 --> 50:28.610
Yeah.

50:28.660 --> 50:29.850
At last.

50:29.900 --> 50:31.770
- You're all right?
- Oh, yes.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.360
Thank you.

50:40.620 --> 50:43.020
You didn't sleep last night.

50:44.460 --> 50:46.400
Do I look that bad?

50:46.900 --> 50:49.370
When you came in last week...

50:49.580 --> 50:51.720
.. there was a change.

50:52.020 --> 50:54.490
You kept a distance from him.

50:56.300 --> 50:58.580
You know, don't you?

50:59.900 --> 51:02.040
About this other woman.

51:03.060 --> 51:05.400
Simon swore me to secrecy.

51:06.780 --> 51:08.980
But he told me about it.

51:10.140 --> 51:12.940
He's acting exactly like his father.

51:15.140 --> 51:16.780
I'm sorry.

51:19.300 --> 51:20.730
She's pregnant.

51:20.780 --> 51:22.050
Kate.

51:22.100 --> 51:24.040
Her doctor told me.

51:25.100 --> 51:27.640
She's having an abortion today.

51:29.540 --> 51:31.810
- He doesn't know?
- No.

51:32.460 --> 51:34.460
When's it happening?

51:35.020 --> 51:36.130
Soon.

51:36.180 --> 51:37.780
One o'clock.

51:38.260 --> 51:39.930
Tell him.

51:39.980 --> 51:41.570
Why should I?

51:41.620 --> 51:43.890
He's got a right to know.

51:47.100 --> 51:48.770
'We're really close.

51:48.820 --> 51:51.810
'All the preparation's done so,
literally, a couple of weeks,

51:51.860 --> 51:53.730
that's what we're looking at to start.

51:53.780 --> 51:56.410
How long, then, until it's finished?

51:56.460 --> 51:58.130
Eight months.

51:58.780 --> 52:00.810
- Right.
- Tea?

52:00.860 --> 52:02.210
Er, no, thanks.

52:02.260 --> 52:03.570
Biscuit, then?

52:03.620 --> 52:05.170
OK.

52:05.220 --> 52:08.740
I'll, er, bring the model
in one day. You can see it.

52:11.340 --> 52:14.290
Tom, mate, you going to tell
Gran about what we did yesterday?

52:14.340 --> 52:16.930
Well, we went on a tour of Villa Park,

52:16.980 --> 52:20.210
it's a football ground, and
it was really, really good.

52:20.260 --> 52:22.810
We saw everything -- the
pitch, the changing rooms,

52:22.860 --> 52:26.450
the museum bit at the back
of the club with the history.

52:26.500 --> 52:28.850
- Can you remember when
it was built? - Yeah.

52:28.900 --> 52:31.570
- What? - Go on, then, what year?

52:32.100 --> 52:35.820
1897 it was built originally, but
they've replaced most of it now.

52:37.500 --> 52:40.040
- Is it big?
- Massive, yeah.

52:41.580 --> 52:44.540
CHATTER FADES INTO THE BACKGROUND

52:53.380 --> 52:56.170
We got a tour. Only, like, celebrities
or whatever get it normally.

52:56.220 --> 52:58.530
That was really cool, actually.

52:58.580 --> 52:59.970
And then we went and...

53:00.020 --> 53:02.560
- MOBILE PHONE BUZZES
- Sorry.

53:03.980 --> 53:05.220
Hi.

53:07.620 --> 53:09.560
Yeah, just, erm...

53:10.620 --> 53:12.410
Just give me a minute.

53:12.460 --> 53:15.050
We went and met the players

53:15.100 --> 53:17.090
and had a go on one of the goals.

53:17.140 --> 53:19.740
Dad missed. It was really funny.

53:20.500 --> 53:21.740
Wow.

53:23.420 --> 53:25.690
And you won this day out?

53:26.100 --> 53:28.130
In a raffle, yeah. It was second prize.

53:28.180 --> 53:29.850
Second prize?

53:29.900 --> 53:31.930
Well, that's a good raffle.

53:31.980 --> 53:33.660
Very lucky.

53:36.660 --> 53:39.000
Dad's always on his phone.

53:39.140 --> 53:40.880
He's very busy.

53:44.980 --> 53:47.130
I'm really sorry. Erm,
an investor's pulled out.

53:47.180 --> 53:50.050
I need to get on the phone
to see if he'll reconsider.

53:50.100 --> 53:52.850
The paperwork's in the office.
I need to take the car. Can I?

53:52.900 --> 53:55.010
No problem. We'll get a taxi home.

53:55.060 --> 53:56.170
Sorry, Mum.

53:56.220 --> 53:57.410
It's OK.

53:57.460 --> 54:00.200
- See you later, mate.
- See you.

54:02.940 --> 54:06.020
Will you take the cups out to the kitchen?

54:06.980 --> 54:10.380
- Yeah, sure. - You know
where it is, don't you?

54:11.060 --> 54:12.770
Down the corridor, on the right.

54:12.820 --> 54:15.770
- Yep, I know. - If you put
them in the dishwasher...

54:15.820 --> 54:17.560
I know, I know.

54:24.540 --> 54:26.450
Do you think it's serious?

54:26.500 --> 54:30.060
Well, when they make a
decision on this child...

54:31.940 --> 54:33.680
.. you'll know.

54:34.300 --> 54:35.570
But...

54:35.620 --> 54:37.290
two years,

54:37.340 --> 54:38.570
it says something.

54:38.620 --> 54:40.160
Two years?

54:41.980 --> 54:44.450
Ros said it was three months.

54:45.540 --> 54:48.020
Oh, Gemma. No.

54:50.980 --> 54:52.720
For two years?!

54:54.780 --> 54:56.490
I thought you knew.

54:56.540 --> 54:59.280
You said you'd found out about it.

54:59.900 --> 55:01.370
Oh, I'm sorry, Gemma.

55:01.420 --> 55:04.020
Why don't you come and sit down?

55:27.940 --> 55:29.480
All sorted?

55:30.940 --> 55:32.680
Yeah, for now.

55:41.340 --> 55:42.810
Love you.

56:02.900 --> 56:06.530
She's not happy I told him, but
she's clearly pleased he knows.

56:06.580 --> 56:09.680
- They're going to keep it?
- I think so.

56:13.220 --> 56:14.730
It's two years.

56:14.780 --> 56:16.050
Yeah.

56:17.300 --> 56:18.700
He lied.

56:19.380 --> 56:21.720
Seems that's what he does.

56:22.060 --> 56:26.090
Jack said, when Simon was young,
he had a different girl every week.

56:26.140 --> 56:27.570
You never told me.

56:27.620 --> 56:29.570
You were at school with him.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.890
It didn't matter. I
thought he was committed.

56:31.940 --> 56:34.970
But when you found out
that he was cheating...

56:35.020 --> 56:36.570
.. were you surprised?

56:36.620 --> 56:38.360
To be honest...

56:38.860 --> 56:41.730
.. I'm surprised it took him so long.

56:44.980 --> 56:46.490
Where are you going?

56:46.540 --> 56:47.690
Work.

56:47.740 --> 56:49.740
I've got work to do.

56:52.740 --> 56:55.490
- Morning. - You told
my wife everything!

56:55.540 --> 56:58.210
Absolutely against the
code of ethics and the law.

56:58.260 --> 57:00.690
- Do you want to talk in private?
- Not acceptable.

57:00.740 --> 57:03.170
What did she say when she called you back?

57:03.220 --> 57:06.370
She was upset. Some mad woman calling
her in the middle of the night.

57:06.420 --> 57:09.720
She thought I'd been up
to something at first.

57:11.820 --> 57:14.980
But she asked me if
what you'd said was true.

57:16.220 --> 57:17.570
And I said, "Yeah."

57:17.620 --> 57:19.370
What did you decide?

57:19.420 --> 57:21.090
She's, erm...

57:21.620 --> 57:23.250
She's going to come with me,

57:23.300 --> 57:25.050
- to the scan.
- Good.

57:25.100 --> 57:28.250
- Still worried what they're going
to find, though. - Of course.

57:28.300 --> 57:31.090
But the point is, you calling
her like that was illegal.

57:31.140 --> 57:32.690
- I know.
- You shouldn't do it.

57:32.740 --> 57:34.280
Understood.

57:35.260 --> 57:38.660
Would you like to make a
formal complaint, then?

57:39.380 --> 57:41.020
No.

57:42.380 --> 57:44.100
Boy or girl?

57:46.900 --> 57:48.840
It's a little girl.

57:50.660 --> 57:51.930
Er...

57:51.980 --> 57:54.330
You said you did a lot of divorce work.

57:54.380 --> 57:55.610
Yeah.

57:55.660 --> 57:57.200
I do. Why?

57:58.460 --> 58:01.060
I'd like to book an appointment.

58:04.660 --> 58:06.210
Neil, could we find a moment

58:06.260 --> 58:07.570
to go over my accounts?

58:07.620 --> 58:09.090
Sure.

58:09.140 --> 58:10.730
Over dinner, maybe?

58:10.780 --> 58:13.490
The moment I tell Gemma, I lose her.

58:13.540 --> 58:15.130
And I lose my son.

58:15.180 --> 58:17.570
From what he said last
night, he still loves you.

58:17.620 --> 58:20.810
And it's good to be loved, Gem.

58:20.860 --> 58:22.530
It really is.

58:23.740 --> 58:26.250
Go on, then. Why are you here, Neil?

58:26.300 --> 58:29.130
Because, in the last five years,
I've thought a lot about your body

58:29.180 --> 58:31.570
and it's got to the point
that I desperately want to know

58:31.620 --> 58:34.180
what's going on underneath that dress.
