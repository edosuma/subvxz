03:37.000 --> 03:38.922
Paul?

03:47.559 --> 03:49.721
You make us all look
like Little Orphan Annie.

03:49.839 --> 03:51.079
We're gonna do it on the air.

03:51.119 --> 03:53.486
The directors turned us off.

03:53.559 --> 03:55.766
Things like that happen at this time of night.

03:55.799 --> 03:59.087
We had quite cool temperatures
way off in the northwest...

04:00.359 --> 04:01.770
Paul!

04:07.039 --> 04:08.689
Paul!

04:11.839 --> 04:13.967
Come here, boy.

04:34.599 --> 04:37.409
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Dolph.

04:37.439 --> 04:39.168
I can't find Paul.

04:40.639 --> 04:42.846
Are you okay? You seem worried.

04:42.919 --> 04:45.445
I told you, I can't find Paul.

04:46.479 --> 04:49.801
I... I woke up and he... he just wasn't there.

04:50.599 --> 04:52.806
- Wasn't where?
- Home.

04:56.399 --> 04:57.969
Where did he go?

04:58.959 --> 05:01.610
I don't know. That's why I'm worried.

05:01.639 --> 05:04.006
Can you come a little closer?

05:04.039 --> 05:05.529
- What?
- Come closer.

05:05.599 --> 05:08.887
You're... You're too distant.
Can't communicate.

05:16.639 --> 05:18.243
Closer.

05:21.479 --> 05:23.288
Come here.

05:26.279 --> 05:27.644
So?

05:27.679 --> 05:31.445
He never takes off on his own like this.
It's weird.

05:31.519 --> 05:35.080
Just... I'm afraid something's happened.

05:35.159 --> 05:37.969
Well, I... I don't know, maybe he got hungry.

05:37.999 --> 05:40.479
Went off looking for food somewhere.

05:40.519 --> 05:42.203
No, he wouldn't do that.

05:42.279 --> 05:45.203
I... I feed him very well at home.

05:45.719 --> 05:49.007
And you didn't see him out this morning
when you were jogging?

05:49.039 --> 05:51.406
Yeah, I don't... I...

05:51.479 --> 05:54.050
I don't jog.

05:54.079 --> 05:56.605
What do you mean?
I know you jog every morning.

05:56.839 --> 05:59.160
No. No, I don't. I...

05:59.199 --> 06:01.645
I'm telling you, I don't jog. I hate running.

06:02.319 --> 06:05.004
Why are you lying?
I've seen you run a hundred times.

06:05.039 --> 06:06.325
I mean, why don't you just admit it?

06:06.359 --> 06:09.044
Why don't you just stop worrying
about your stupid mutt, okay?

06:09.079 --> 06:11.446
'Cause he'll be back.

06:11.519 --> 06:14.489
Okay? Dogs, they always...
They always return to their masters.

06:14.559 --> 06:15.924
It's proven.

06:16.759 --> 06:18.284
Why don't you go throw on
some normal clothes

06:18.359 --> 06:21.761
and just go off to work
and take your mind off things.

06:22.879 --> 06:24.290
It's a robe.

06:25.119 --> 06:26.280
Yeah, well, it doesn't suit you.

06:26.359 --> 06:29.727
And it's pervy and it's disgusting
and disturbing me.

06:30.079 --> 06:32.480
Can you just reassure me
instead of talking about my robe?

06:32.559 --> 06:34.448
No. No.

06:34.879 --> 06:37.803
I can't right now. I gotta go. I'm in a rush.

06:38.559 --> 06:41.244
I'm thinking about living elsewhere.

06:41.319 --> 06:44.607
Just picking some place random, far away.

06:45.799 --> 06:49.565
Because this life is way too depressing.

06:50.199 --> 06:54.204
I am never ever coming back here.

06:56.119 --> 06:58.087
And you're only taking two suitcases?

06:58.119 --> 07:01.248
Yeah. I'm gonna stay in touch
with you, buddy.

07:01.279 --> 07:03.247
Okay?

07:03.879 --> 07:05.927
I'm gonna miss you.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.048
Jesus Organic Pizza.

08:00.118 --> 08:02.485
This is Emma. How may I help you today?

08:02.558 --> 08:04.879
Are you a pizza restaurant?

08:04.958 --> 08:06.687
That is correct. We just opened.

08:06.718 --> 08:08.800
Would you like to place an order?

08:08.838 --> 08:11.079
No, I'm not really hungry yet.

08:11.998 --> 08:14.683
Maybe you prefer to call back later?

08:14.718 --> 08:16.846
Well, I don't... Maybe. I...

08:16.878 --> 08:20.280
I just wanna hear a little more first,
like, for instance...

08:20.358 --> 08:22.520
Who delivers the pizza?

08:23.398 --> 08:25.366
A delivery person, sir.

08:26.238 --> 08:28.764
- In a truck?
- No, in a car.

08:30.758 --> 08:32.681
And how is it presented?

08:32.758 --> 08:34.885
Is it delivered in a bag?

08:34.998 --> 08:37.126
No, in a box, sir.

08:37.198 --> 08:39.166
Okay.

08:39.198 --> 08:43.089
One of those cardboard pizza boxes
with the logo printed on it?

08:43.357 --> 08:45.725
That's right, one of those boxes.

08:46.718 --> 08:49.767
Okay. Out of curiosity, what is the logo?

08:50.878 --> 08:54.883
The logo is a rabbit on a motorcycle, sir.

08:55.718 --> 08:58.449
- The same as on the flyer?
- Exactly.

08:59.198 --> 09:00.927
Why a rabbit?

09:00.998 --> 09:04.241
I think it symbolizes the speed of the delivery.

09:04.318 --> 09:07.561
But I'm not 100% sure that's the reason.

09:07.598 --> 09:10.204
It's just my interpretation.

09:10.238 --> 09:11.763
I could check with the manager.

09:11.918 --> 09:14.649
Yes, please. That'd be nice.

09:14.718 --> 09:16.322
Okay, please hold.

10:04.718 --> 10:06.447
- Sir?
- Yes.

10:06.478 --> 10:08.606
My manager just confirmed

10:08.718 --> 10:12.325
that the rabbit indeed
does symbolize the speed.

10:12.398 --> 10:14.287
- / was right.
- Okay.

10:14.358 --> 10:15.883
Would you like to place an order now

10:15.958 --> 10:19.326
or would you rather wait until
you're really hungry and call back then?

10:19.438 --> 10:22.567
I... I think that...

10:23.278 --> 10:26.487
Can you hold on a minute,
I'm getting another phone call.

10:26.558 --> 10:28.606
Okay, just don't hang up.

10:29.598 --> 10:31.487
- Yes.
- Hello, Dolph.

10:31.638 --> 10:33.208
It's Victor.

10:33.318 --> 10:35.798
- Victor, how are you?
- I'm fine.

10:35.878 --> 10:40.566
Um, actually if you turn around,
I'm right here.

10:40.638 --> 10:41.639
Turn.

10:42.798 --> 10:45.404
<i>- Hey.
- Yeah, I know. I saw you come in.</i>

10:45.478 --> 10:46.843
Quick, what do you want?

10:46.878 --> 10:50.166
Well, we have a big prob/em
with the palm tree.

10:50.678 --> 10:52.407
What is it?

10:53.158 --> 10:57.004
I'd rather you come and see for yourself
because of...

10:57.078 --> 10:59.319
I'm not comfortable telling you
over the phone,

10:59.358 --> 11:01.565
it's quite odd.

11:01.638 --> 11:04.164
I'm on the other line.
Can we talk about it later?

11:04.198 --> 11:06.678
Yes, of course, sure.
You're... You're the boss.

11:06.758 --> 11:09.807
<i>- Okay, we'll... we'll get to it later.
- Good.</i>

11:09.838 --> 11:11.602
<i>- B ye.
- B ye-b y.</i>

11:11.678 --> 11:13.328
Bye.

11:13.998 --> 11:16.285
- Are you still there?
- Of course, sir.

11:16.598 --> 11:18.088
Yeah, come to think of it,

11:18.158 --> 11:21.480
actually something does not sit well with me
regarding this logo.

11:21.518 --> 11:23.088
- What is it?
- Well...

11:24.398 --> 11:26.639
I get the whole idea about a rabbit
being fast.

11:26.678 --> 11:30.205
I mean, that makes sense.
But why a motorcycle?

11:30.278 --> 11:34.806
The rabbit's fast enough on its own,
so the motorcycle's overkill.

11:34.878 --> 11:37.165
I mean, don't you think that's a little weird?

11:37.438 --> 11:41.079
Yeah, it's true.
I haven't thought about it, to be honest.

11:41.158 --> 11:45.049
Now that you've pointed it out,
it strikes me as strange too.

11:45.958 --> 11:51.249
Because now I think of the motorcycle
as being fast, not the rabbit.

11:51.278 --> 11:56.000
I mean, even if he's driving it,
he's no longer the cause of the speed.

11:56.038 --> 11:58.882
Technically, the motorcycle is.

11:58.958 --> 12:01.609
Yes, I agree it's a bit ambiguous.

12:01.678 --> 12:03.919
Yeah.

12:04.758 --> 12:09.400
Um, well, I don't... I'm not gonna
be ordering anything just yet.

12:09.718 --> 12:10.844
Sorry.

12:10.918 --> 12:12.408
I understand, sir.

12:12.438 --> 12:15.169
I mean, the logo was ill-conceived.

12:15.238 --> 12:16.921
It must be unsettling.

12:16.997 --> 12:21.207
No, it's not that. I'm... I'm just upset today.

12:21.917 --> 12:25.205
My dog is gone and this takes my mind off it.

12:25.237 --> 12:28.923
You know, I just called you
to give myself a distraction.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.959
This was lovely.

12:31.037 --> 12:33.768
I... I loved this conversation.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.647
I... I hope to speak with you again.

12:36.717 --> 12:39.721
You know where to reach me.
My name is Emma.

12:41.637 --> 12:42.798
Okay.

12:42.877 --> 12:44.959
And what's your name?

12:45.797 --> 12:49.563
It's Dolph Springer.

12:50.397 --> 12:53.321
Very well, Dolph. Goodbye.

13:17.757 --> 13:22.206
Texture, not the color.
Certainly comes in many colors...

13:31.837 --> 13:34.522
Can't pass through, sir. Street's closed.

13:34.597 --> 13:35.758
Turn around.

13:38.397 --> 13:39.637
What happened here?

13:43.317 --> 13:45.558
Why do you wanna know?

13:45.637 --> 13:47.878
I'm from the neighborhood.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.006
And I... I drive by here every day.

13:51.037 --> 13:55.008
So I'm curious why there's a charred car here.

13:59.677 --> 14:01.759
Well, let me go find out.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.407
Okay. I gotta be honest with you.

14:37.157 --> 14:40.400
I just pretended to get information
from that guy over there

14:40.437 --> 14:43.361
to make you believe
I was getting the answers.

14:43.397 --> 14:47.322
But the reality is, I had no need to enquire.

14:48.037 --> 14:50.643
'Cause I know exactly what happened.

14:51.197 --> 14:54.121
And I could have told you
from the beginning.

14:55.237 --> 14:56.648
Okay.

14:57.357 --> 15:00.884
I just don't feel like telling you... sir.

15:01.877 --> 15:05.404
- You understand?
- Um, yeah.

15:05.757 --> 15:07.919
Good. Turn your car around.

15:08.877 --> 15:10.925
Now, please.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.486
Hey, Dolph.

18:01.756 --> 18:03.758
Why do you keep coming here?

18:03.796 --> 18:06.276
Why wouldn't I? I like this job.

18:06.716 --> 18:09.845
- Is that a problem?
- No, no. We... We all do.

18:09.996 --> 18:13.079
It's just a little different in your case.

18:14.796 --> 18:16.719
You were fired three months ago.

18:17.396 --> 18:18.636
So?

18:19.756 --> 18:21.360
What difference does it make?

18:21.436 --> 18:25.077
Well, it's a little weird to come back
to a place where you've been let go.

18:25.116 --> 18:28.484
And besides you don't even conform
to office hours.

18:28.556 --> 18:31.127
Yeah, and your computer's
not even turned on.

18:31.156 --> 18:33.841
You're pretending to work. It's bullshit.

18:34.356 --> 18:35.926
What the fuck do you care?

18:36.596 --> 18:37.643
What if I like it?

18:37.676 --> 18:39.201
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry, Dolph.

18:39.676 --> 18:44.045
But if you keep coming here,
I'm gonna have to report you to the board.

18:44.956 --> 18:46.003
Me, too.

18:46.836 --> 18:49.999
You disgust me. I can't even look at you.

18:51.476 --> 18:54.002
Richard, wanna have lunch?

18:54.676 --> 18:56.485
Buy you a burger for old times' sake.

18:56.556 --> 19:00.322
No. I mean, break's over in three minutes

19:00.356 --> 19:04.759
and the others will just reject me
if I keep being your friend.

19:04.836 --> 19:06.486
Okay. Never mind.

19:06.996 --> 19:07.997
- Bye.
- Bye, Dolph.

19:08.076 --> 19:09.202
- Goodbye.
- Take care.

19:12.316 --> 19:14.159
Those fuckers!

20:14.556 --> 20:16.126
Well...

20:16.196 --> 20:18.198
I'm done for today, boss.

20:18.836 --> 20:22.443
Um, we really have to talk
about the... the palm tree.

20:23.236 --> 20:26.046
Did you notice anyone come by
while I was gone?

20:27.996 --> 20:29.964
Those are flowers.

20:30.476 --> 20:33.798
Yes. Victor, did you see anybody come by?

20:35.076 --> 20:36.316
No.

20:37.396 --> 20:43.039
I hate to bother you about this, boss,
but we really have to talk about the palm tree.

20:44.036 --> 20:46.243
We have a problem.

20:46.276 --> 20:47.846
What is it?

20:48.156 --> 20:50.443
It's kind of hard to explain.

20:51.196 --> 20:53.244
I don't know how it happened or why,

20:53.276 --> 20:57.325
but the palm tree is no longer a palm tree.

20:59.435 --> 21:01.756
- No.
- What are you talking about?

21:04.635 --> 21:06.125
What...

21:09.275 --> 21:10.765
Unbelievable.

21:11.595 --> 21:13.279
That's why I wanted to show you.

21:13.395 --> 21:16.524
HOW...

21:17.675 --> 21:21.760
Twenty years of gardening,
I've never seen this in my whole life.

21:21.795 --> 21:23.604
I can't get over it.

21:24.795 --> 21:26.763
It's a pine tree now.

21:26.795 --> 21:28.797
I know. It's crazy.

21:30.235 --> 21:33.842
Well, how is that even possible?

21:35.555 --> 21:37.398
I don't know, boss.

21:37.475 --> 21:41.116
Maybe it's a disease or some kinda mutation.

21:42.715 --> 21:45.286
I gotta look up on the Internet.

21:45.635 --> 21:47.683
Well, I... I don't want a pine tree here.

21:47.755 --> 21:49.598
I don't like this at all.

21:49.635 --> 21:51.399
The palm tree was much more fitting.

21:52.675 --> 21:56.361
Excuse me. Is there a Dolph here?

21:57.275 --> 21:58.606
Yeah, that's me.

21:58.835 --> 22:00.439
I have a pizza here for you.

22:00.515 --> 22:02.165
No, I didn't order a pizza.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.845
I... I called, but I didn't order.

22:03.915 --> 22:06.122
So, that's... that's a mistake.

22:06.155 --> 22:08.237
Nope. It's on the house.

22:09.235 --> 22:11.363
What do you mean "on the house"?

22:11.435 --> 22:12.880
Who sent it?

22:12.955 --> 22:16.516
I don't know, sir.
I was asked to bring it to you.

22:16.875 --> 22:18.115
Just doing my job.

22:19.035 --> 22:20.958
Yeah, okay, here.

22:22.715 --> 22:24.399
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

22:26.635 --> 22:28.444
You're sure getting a lot of stuff today, boss.

22:28.595 --> 22:30.359
I didn't ask for any of this.

22:30.435 --> 22:31.925
Okay.

22:31.995 --> 22:34.646
Look, does that logo make any sense to you?

22:37.555 --> 22:39.239
Yes.

22:39.315 --> 22:41.716
They're fast, I would say.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.877
So, what do we do now?

22:44.795 --> 22:46.559
I don't know, boss.

22:47.315 --> 22:51.001
Do you want me to take the pine out
and replace it with another palm tree?

22:51.035 --> 22:53.402
Could you do that?
Would that be too complicated?

22:53.475 --> 22:56.797
No. It would cost a little, but it's doable.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.525
How much?

22:58.555 --> 23:00.398
I don't know, 500.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.001
Yeah, okay. Yeah, do it.

23:05.075 --> 23:06.725
- Do it.
- You're sure?

23:06.795 --> 23:10.197
Yeah, I can't leave this pine tree here.
This doesn't make any sense.

24:04.235 --> 24:05.805
Dolph?

24:07.115 --> 24:08.640
Who is this?

24:08.675 --> 24:10.916
It's a good thing you called.

24:12.675 --> 24:15.155
Is this a joke? Who... Who is this?

24:15.795 --> 24:18.321
You've lost your dog, haven't you?

24:19.555 --> 24:21.478
Mike, is that you? Is this...

24:21.515 --> 24:23.916
Are you fucking with me? You are lame.

24:23.955 --> 24:25.957
Answer me.

24:25.995 --> 24:28.157
Yeah, you can drop the mysterious voice now.

24:28.235 --> 24:30.681
I'm not buying it at all, it's ridiculous.

24:30.755 --> 24:32.439
Don't you have anything better to do?

24:32.475 --> 24:34.125
Dolph, listen to me carefully.

24:34.155 --> 24:37.796
This isn't Mike and it isn't a joke.
I'm deadly serious.

24:37.875 --> 24:40.799
You've lost your dog, haven't you?

24:40.835 --> 24:42.917
Yeah, I can't find my dog. What do you care?

24:42.995 --> 24:45.362
We must meet.

24:45.435 --> 24:46.641
I don't understand.

24:46.675 --> 24:49.724
That's all I can say on the phone.
We must meet soon.

24:49.795 --> 24:51.160
It's about Paul.

24:51.795 --> 24:54.924
Meet me tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. on the dot.

24:54.995 --> 24:59.239
Latitude 34.11, longitude negative 117.

24:59.355 --> 25:01.119
I'll explain everything.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.445
Perfect.

26:08.754 --> 26:10.085
Hello?

26:11.514 --> 26:12.925
Hello?

26:13.594 --> 26:15.119
Hello?

26:15.874 --> 26:17.558
Is this Dolph?

26:18.114 --> 26:20.594
Um, yes.

26:21.074 --> 26:23.076
Yes, it is Dolph. It's me Dolph.

26:24.754 --> 26:27.280
I don't recognize your voice.

26:27.354 --> 26:30.563
It's maybe because
I smoke a lot of cigarettes today.

26:31.194 --> 26:33.322
That's Why.

26:34.074 --> 26:37.203
Okay. I smoke too, all the time.

26:37.874 --> 26:39.603
It's so pleasant.

26:39.674 --> 26:41.438
It's true, I... I agree.

26:42.274 --> 26:44.595
So, how have you been since this morning?

26:44.634 --> 26:47.797
I've been well. Thank you.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.197
So you sent me the pizza?

26:50.274 --> 26:52.117
Yeah, that was me.

26:52.194 --> 26:54.276
Okay, that was you. That... That was very nice.

26:55.074 --> 26:56.280
Thank you very much.

26:56.354 --> 27:00.200
Well, did you get my note?

27:02.114 --> 27:04.481
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

27:04.554 --> 27:06.602
It's right in front of me.

27:07.394 --> 27:08.805
And?

27:09.874 --> 27:10.955
"And"?

27:12.474 --> 27:15.000
Are you interested in my proposition?

27:17.634 --> 27:20.319
Yes, I'm interested.

27:20.394 --> 27:23.318
I am very, very interested.

27:23.994 --> 27:25.564
Very much.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.634
Good.

27:42.714 --> 27:44.239
Paul!

27:49.514 --> 27:50.515
Paul!

27:52.434 --> 27:53.674
Come and get it!

27:58.434 --> 28:00.357
Come here, boy!

28:10.274 --> 28:13.357
Paul!

29:30.314 --> 29:32.476
- Hello.
- Hi.

29:44.873 --> 29:46.796
Master Chang has sent me to warn you.

29:46.833 --> 29:49.154
He'll be running a little late.

29:49.793 --> 29:51.795
- Master Chang?
- Yes.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.995
You're meeting Master Chang.

29:54.873 --> 29:56.398
I didn't know.

29:56.473 --> 29:59.841
I mean... I mean,
I know I'm meeting someone,

29:59.913 --> 30:03.713
but I didn't know he had a funny name.

30:03.793 --> 30:05.841
He also said I should give you this.

30:05.913 --> 30:08.041
To make the wait more agreeable.

30:08.993 --> 30:10.438
Okay.

30:11.633 --> 30:14.603
So, when is he coming?

30:14.633 --> 30:17.284
You know, 'cause I have a busy life.

30:17.313 --> 30:18.997
I had to take off work.

30:19.033 --> 30:20.478
We know you're not working, Dolph.

30:20.513 --> 30:24.723
You were fired three months ago.
You have all the time in the world.

30:25.993 --> 30:29.839
Yeah. But, no, 'cause I still go to the office.

30:30.433 --> 30:34.074
I highly recommend you read this book.
It's life changing.

30:34.153 --> 30:37.521
Yeah, I'll see. Can't promise anything.

31:48.153 --> 31:50.201
What are you doing?

31:50.233 --> 31:51.917
Hi.

31:51.953 --> 31:55.435
Listen, last night
was the best night of my life.

31:55.473 --> 31:57.999
I loved everything.

31:58.073 --> 31:59.996
Good. I have to go to work.

32:00.073 --> 32:02.314
Really, thank you very much.

32:02.393 --> 32:04.873
I'm gonna leave my husband today.

32:04.913 --> 32:06.358
'Cause I wanna live with you now.

32:06.433 --> 32:10.518
So I'm gonna dump that asshole.
I wanna start over with you, Dolph.

32:10.593 --> 32:12.436
You know, build something strong.

32:13.753 --> 32:16.120
Okay.

32:16.153 --> 32:17.757
Thank you very much for the pizza.

32:17.953 --> 32:19.955
Okay, you're welcome.

32:19.993 --> 32:21.404
Take care.

32:35.193 --> 32:38.834
Sir, I took it upon myself
to paint your vehicle blue.

32:40.313 --> 32:43.157
But it's not necessary.
I like it red, thank you.

32:43.273 --> 32:46.038
Very well. Maybe next time.

32:46.153 --> 32:48.281
Maybe next time, thank you.

33:09.033 --> 33:11.684
"Blindfold your dog
with an opaque scarf

33:11.713 --> 33:14.842
"and secure a garlic clove close to his snout.

33:14.873 --> 33:19.083
"Then spin him around for a couple
of seconds so as to disorient him.

33:19.153 --> 33:23.522
"Then run away from him as fast as you can
in a serpentine fashion.

33:23.553 --> 33:25.362
<i>"If he succeeds in tracking you,</i>

33:25.433 --> 33:28.835
"you can be sure his sense of smell
is excellent."

33:44.553 --> 33:47.557
I'm going to get out of the limousine

33:47.673 --> 33:51.837
and walk into the forest,
away from curious eyes.

33:51.873 --> 33:54.637
Wait awhile, then fol/me.

34:36.112 --> 34:38.717
You did good to come, Dolph.

34:38.752 --> 34:40.516
That was the right decision.

34:41.152 --> 34:42.677
I didn't have much of a choice.

34:42.752 --> 34:44.719
You always have a choice.

34:45.272 --> 34:48.719
When I was 16, a friend dared me
to douse my face with acid.

34:48.752 --> 34:50.914
It was stupid. I wanted to impress him.

34:50.992 --> 34:55.121
And I did it without thinking about it,
but I did have a choice.

34:55.152 --> 34:57.234
Look at me now.

34:57.672 --> 35:00.562
- Who are you?
- I'm a man just like you.

35:00.592 --> 35:04.074
But I want to tell you a bit about
what I do for a living.

35:04.112 --> 35:06.843
It might be of interest to you.

35:06.912 --> 35:11.998
I'm the founder of a company
that specializes in abuse prevention for pets.

35:12.072 --> 35:15.758
I love pets more than anything in this world

35:15.792 --> 35:18.033
and I can't stand the thought
of them being hurt.

35:18.112 --> 35:21.161
Most people buy pets
without considering the implications.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.998
They love them at first and care for them,

35:24.072 --> 35:26.678
but then lose interest day by day
and start neglecting them.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.476
They stop loving them.

35:29.552 --> 35:34.956
Causing the pets tremendous emotional pain
and they're unable to express it.

35:34.992 --> 35:37.962
That's how the dynamics of abuse set in.

35:38.472 --> 35:39.837
I've never abused my dog.

35:39.912 --> 35:41.482
- I don't know why you're...
- Let me finish.

35:41.952 --> 35:44.922
Rather than taking action
after the harm is done,

35:44.992 --> 35:46.835
and it's basically too late,

35:46.912 --> 35:49.916
I favor prevention.

35:49.992 --> 35:52.996
I only realized I loved my face

35:53.072 --> 35:56.042
after it had been burned with acid,
but it was too late.

35:56.112 --> 35:59.116
Before, it was just my face,
I didn't know I loved it.

35:59.152 --> 36:03.157
I only started loving it again
when it had partially disappeared.

36:03.192 --> 36:05.843
- Do you follow?
- Not really.

36:05.912 --> 36:08.882
Man gets accustomed,
inured to things rapidly.

36:08.952 --> 36:10.442
He gets used to everything.

36:10.512 --> 36:13.118
When you get a new jacket,
you are happy to wear it.

36:13.192 --> 36:15.638
But that joy wears off, you get accustomed,

36:15.672 --> 36:19.677
and after a few days that jacket
doesn't bring you any joy at all.

36:19.712 --> 36:24.274
On the other hand,
if that jacket is stolen from you,

36:25.752 --> 36:28.835
desire ignites again inside of you.

36:29.192 --> 36:34.073
All of a sudden, you'll miss that jacket
and you'll love that jacket again.

36:34.152 --> 36:37.042
Same goes for shoes or love.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.841
It's a simple concept.

36:38.872 --> 36:40.874
My company kidnaps pets

36:40.952 --> 36:46.516
so the owner can have a chance to realize
how much their pets mean to them.

36:46.952 --> 36:48.875
After a few days, we return the pets

36:48.952 --> 36:53.719
and the owner's attitude, vis-a-vis the pet,
is completely reversed.

36:54.832 --> 36:57.438
He loves them like he did on the first day.

36:57.512 --> 36:59.162
Sometimes even more.

37:01.552 --> 37:04.158
- You kidnapped Paul?
- Correct.

37:05.072 --> 37:06.233
Why?

37:06.592 --> 37:08.037
I just told you why.

37:08.392 --> 37:10.315
No. Why me?

37:10.632 --> 37:12.555
Completely random choice.

37:13.072 --> 37:14.915
That's awful.

37:15.232 --> 37:17.553
Who do you think you are?

37:17.672 --> 37:22.075
Can I have my dog back now, please,
so I can love it a bit more? Is that it?

37:22.112 --> 37:24.718
That's what would happen usually, yes.

37:24.752 --> 37:28.234
But I have to tell you,
we've had a little problem with Paul.

37:28.272 --> 37:32.163
It's quite embarrassing. In seven years
of service, this has never happened.

37:32.272 --> 37:36.277
The technician who was assigned
to Paul's kidnapping,

37:36.312 --> 37:38.360
yesterday morning lost control of the vehicle.

37:38.432 --> 37:40.799
We don't know how or why.

37:40.872 --> 37:43.762
The van crashed
and the technician perished in the flames.

37:44.112 --> 37:46.479
Paul was in the back in a cage.

37:46.552 --> 37:49.158
- God.
- No, don't worry about that.

37:49.232 --> 37:51.121
The police report was crystal clear

37:51.152 --> 37:54.599
on that point, no dog bones were
recovered from the scene.

37:54.672 --> 37:57.835
And apparently the cage door was open.

37:57.912 --> 38:00.802
This leads to believe
that Paul successfully escaped the fire.

38:00.872 --> 38:01.919
No.

38:02.672 --> 38:04.595
The cage was open.

38:04.632 --> 38:07.636
He has to be alive. Don't worry, there is hope.

38:07.712 --> 38:10.477
I've hired a top-level detective
to track him down.

38:11.272 --> 38:12.717
God.

38:25.151 --> 38:28.314
I forgot to give you this. This should help.

38:28.391 --> 38:29.995
Yeah, that's okay. I already have it.

38:30.031 --> 38:31.362
No, this is Volume ll.

38:31.431 --> 38:33.513
Forget the first one, I completely denigrate it.

38:33.591 --> 38:36.834
Volume ll is much more mature, you'll see.

38:36.871 --> 38:39.272
Amongst other things,
I approached the subject

38:39.311 --> 38:45.000
of telepathic communication with your dog
to stay in contact even when you're apart.

38:45.071 --> 38:49.201
It's groundbreaking. You'll learn a lot
about yourself and animal nature.

38:49.271 --> 38:52.400
Can I still communicate with him if he's dead?

41:39.111 --> 41:41.842
- Are you Dolph Springer?
- Yeah, that's me.

41:41.911 --> 41:44.152
I'm the detective
in charge of finding your dog.

41:44.271 --> 41:45.352
Paul.

41:45.991 --> 41:47.072
My name is Ronnie.

41:49.791 --> 41:52.795
Do you mind if I come inside and take a look?

41:53.671 --> 41:54.832
Yeah.

43:38.910 --> 43:41.277
Interesting.

43:45.910 --> 43:50.040
That must really get you down,
seeing his empty basket right there.

43:50.870 --> 43:52.474
Yes, it's awful.

43:53.590 --> 43:55.001
I understand.

43:55.670 --> 43:58.321
Has he always slept in this room?

43:58.390 --> 44:02.714
No, no. First the basket was in my room
and that lasted a few years.

44:03.270 --> 44:05.716
Did you decide to change or did he?

44:05.830 --> 44:08.879
Can't remember. It just happened.

44:15.830 --> 44:17.161
Did he like this toy?

44:21.710 --> 44:23.792
Yeah, very much.

44:23.870 --> 44:26.032
Is it one of those wheezy things?

44:26.510 --> 44:27.636
Yup.

44:28.790 --> 44:30.155
Did he bite it to make it wheeze

44:30.270 --> 44:33.831
or was it more of a comfort thing
to make him feel safe?

44:35.590 --> 44:39.640
At first he loved the sound it made,
but the apparatus broke

44:39.670 --> 44:43.994
and then it just... just became a comfort thing.

44:50.270 --> 44:51.760
That's classic.

44:52.750 --> 44:54.240
Can I ask you something?

44:54.310 --> 44:57.041
Have you worked a lot with
that Master Chang character?

44:57.910 --> 44:59.321
Do you know him well?

44:59.350 --> 45:02.194
No, not really. We've spoken
on the phone a couple of times,

45:02.230 --> 45:04.551
but that's pretty much it.

45:08.910 --> 45:10.400
Is that Paul's food?

45:11.390 --> 45:12.596
Yeah.

45:24.230 --> 45:27.791
Does he favor any particular brands
or is he pretty easy?

45:29.950 --> 45:31.520
He's easy.

45:31.550 --> 45:33.837
Well, I think that about covers it.

45:33.910 --> 45:35.958
I've taken up enough of your time.

45:36.030 --> 45:40.513
Is there anything else you'd like to add,
maybe an anecdote or a bit of information?

45:40.590 --> 45:42.035
No.

45:42.070 --> 45:45.791
Do you want to see a picture of him?
It might help you to recognize him.

45:45.870 --> 45:48.157
No, there's nothing more
a picture would tell me.

45:48.230 --> 45:51.040
I've gathered up enough information.

45:51.070 --> 45:55.280
I was wondering, however, if you have a bit
of fecal matter from your dog?

45:56.870 --> 45:58.440
Excuse me?

45:58.470 --> 46:02.395
A bit of excrement, shit from Paul?

46:04.110 --> 46:06.078
No, I don't do that.

46:10.910 --> 46:11.991
Okay.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.080
WheW!

46:35.150 --> 46:37.118
What do you think, boss? Do you like this?

46:38.630 --> 46:41.031
Well, it's tiny. Mine was much bigger.

46:42.870 --> 46:45.032
I know, I'm sorry.

46:45.110 --> 46:47.636
This is the biggest they had.

46:48.990 --> 46:50.958
It's still better than a pine tree, no?

46:52.589 --> 46:57.834
You have to keep in mind that this will grow.
It will grow, they said.

46:59.469 --> 47:01.710
Yeah.

47:24.189 --> 47:29.036
420, 440, 460, 480, 500.

47:30.229 --> 47:32.914
Thank you very much, boss.

47:32.989 --> 47:35.356
So what did you do with the pine tree?

47:35.429 --> 47:40.151
I gave it away to a charity
that tends to needy children.

47:40.509 --> 47:42.352
Very needy children.

47:43.389 --> 47:46.359
That's great.
That's exactly what I would have done.

47:46.429 --> 47:48.397
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

47:48.509 --> 47:50.796
They'll probably use it for Christmas.

47:51.549 --> 47:53.472
I hope so.

47:53.909 --> 47:57.709
By the way, before I forget,
you have to meet Master Chang at his office

47:57.749 --> 48:00.673
between 2:00 and 3:00. It's very important.

48:02.389 --> 48:05.040
But how do you know Master Chang?

48:06.589 --> 48:08.398
I don't.

48:09.749 --> 48:12.480
Then why did you just mention him?

48:14.629 --> 48:17.314
I have no idea why I said that.

48:18.229 --> 48:21.278
I don't understand, boss, it's very strange.

48:21.349 --> 48:23.920
As if someone spoke through me.

48:24.789 --> 48:27.235
- Who?
- I don't know.

48:28.189 --> 48:32.035
I have no idea. I feel dizzy now.

48:32.069 --> 48:34.151
- Are you okay?
- No.

48:34.789 --> 48:37.520
I don't feel good. I...

48:39.989 --> 48:42.037
- Would you like a glass of water?
- Please.

48:42.069 --> 48:43.480
Please, yes.

48:43.549 --> 48:45.438
I think I'm going to faint, boss.

49:23.669 --> 49:25.000
Hi.

49:26.789 --> 49:28.553
Is there a problem?

49:28.789 --> 49:30.996
- Yeah. He's dead.
- What?

49:32.069 --> 49:34.231
- How?
- Cardiac arrest.

49:34.749 --> 49:37.116
Probably just overexerted himself
or something.

49:37.149 --> 49:39.720
His muscles were all contracted.

49:39.829 --> 49:42.400
I don't know, maybe lifted a tree
or something like that.

49:42.869 --> 49:46.396
Yeah, he carried a small palm tree
about 10 minutes ago.

49:46.469 --> 49:48.790
Well, there you go.
It's probably what did it.

49:49.789 --> 49:51.439
Holy shit!

49:51.469 --> 49:53.710
Yeah, it happens.

49:53.789 --> 49:55.314
I was just bringing him a glass of water.

49:55.789 --> 49:58.190
- May I?
- Of course.

49:58.269 --> 49:59.953
- Here.
- Yeah.

50:00.829 --> 50:04.595
Victor's gone. Darn, so sudden.

50:08.709 --> 50:10.711
I needed that.

50:11.429 --> 50:14.353
Well, I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

50:14.389 --> 50:15.879
Take it easy.

50:17.949 --> 50:20.520
One more thing before I forget.

50:20.589 --> 50:23.195
Master Chang wanted to meet you
at his office today

50:23.269 --> 50:26.478
between 2:00 and 3:00. It's very important.

51:23.868 --> 51:25.996
- Mike!
- Dolph!

51:27.188 --> 51:30.112
- Dolph, can you hear me?
- Yeah. Where are you?

51:34.548 --> 51:37.438
I don't know. Somewhere.

51:38.828 --> 51:43.038
I just completely disregarded all road signs.

51:43.948 --> 51:45.712
I haven't slept since I left.

51:45.748 --> 51:49.992
I just drove and drove

51:51.468 --> 51:53.277
and drove.

51:54.268 --> 51:56.555
I gotta be pretty far out by now.

51:57.668 --> 52:00.478
I'm exhausted, Dolph.

52:00.548 --> 52:03.438
I think I'm at the end of the world.

52:03.468 --> 52:05.869
Do you like it?

52:06.948 --> 52:08.837
I don't know yet.

52:08.908 --> 52:14.392
I gotta be honest. It's... It's a bit unsettling,
you know, all this void.

52:15.228 --> 52:17.959
But it's... it's also kind of pleasant.

52:18.708 --> 52:22.713
There's nothing, it's... it's soothing.

52:22.788 --> 52:24.631
I can imagine.

52:24.668 --> 52:27.148
Yeah, well, it's given me some time

52:27.188 --> 52:31.876
to ask certain questions
about myself, you know.

52:33.188 --> 52:34.553
Good, that's good.

52:35.388 --> 52:37.038
What kinda questions?

52:37.108 --> 52:41.079
You know, just personal stuff.

52:41.508 --> 52:43.351
Deep stuff.

52:44.588 --> 52:46.511
Just downright deep stuff, like...

52:47.948 --> 52:50.633
Why it is that there is this block?

52:50.668 --> 52:53.672
I mean, you know this... this block that I have.

52:53.748 --> 52:54.829
No, I don't.

52:54.908 --> 52:56.990
You know.

52:57.108 --> 52:59.952
It's a silly block I have
about the whole jogging thing.

53:00.028 --> 53:02.554
Why I can't admit that I jog?

53:02.628 --> 53:05.711
What... What is that about, Dolph?

53:05.828 --> 53:09.071
I think about it all the time.
I mean, why... why do I do that?

53:09.148 --> 53:15.030
<i>I mean, it's just constantly gnawing at me,
but I... I can't stop it.</i>

53:16.468 --> 53:20.678
Yeah, I understand.
You know, there's no shame in jogging.

53:21.268 --> 53:25.193
At all. I mean, there's nothing bad about it.

53:26.748 --> 53:28.989
I don't jog.

53:30.708 --> 53:34.235
I swear. I hate running.

53:34.628 --> 53:36.551
I always have.

53:38.428 --> 53:39.759
Do you believe me?

53:41.068 --> 53:43.753
I believe you, Mike. Don't worry.

53:45.668 --> 53:47.716
So, where are you going?

53:48.948 --> 53:51.189
I think I'm just gonna drive.

53:52.228 --> 53:54.037
Straight ahead.

53:55.308 --> 53:57.549
I kinda want to see what's after.

53:58.428 --> 54:01.750
By the way,
Master Chang would like to see you today.

54:01.788 --> 54:04.189
He's expecting you to come by the office.

54:04.228 --> 54:06.879
Try to stop by, Dolph, it's important.

54:06.908 --> 54:09.593
Yeah, I'm... I'm there now.

54:11.428 --> 54:13.749
I... I better go, I don't want to be late.

54:14.788 --> 54:17.439
All right.
Well, you take care of yourself, Dolph.

54:17.468 --> 54:20.153
Okay. Bye. Good luck.

54:58.788 --> 55:01.439
Dolph! Come in.

55:01.468 --> 55:03.630
- Hi.
- Please, take a seat.

55:17.388 --> 55:20.835
You seem better than the last time I saw you.
Am I wrong?

55:22.828 --> 55:25.274
My gardener died this morning.

55:25.308 --> 55:28.232
He had a stroke right before my very eyes.

55:29.268 --> 55:32.157
And I still haven't found
the dog you stole from me.

55:32.187 --> 55:35.987
So, I can't really say I'm doing better.

55:36.587 --> 55:40.194
- Did you get a chance to read my book?
- Partially.

55:40.707 --> 55:44.917
The chapter on telepathy
is particularly interesting.

55:45.427 --> 55:47.873
I'm... I'm just beginning phase seven.

55:49.627 --> 55:51.675
It's the most important phase.

55:51.707 --> 55:53.755
Yes, I know.

55:54.347 --> 55:56.156
I have two things to tell you.

55:56.187 --> 55:59.828
The first, it's that I had
a very surprising dream last night.

55:59.867 --> 56:01.710
And that dream concerns you.

56:02.187 --> 56:04.554
I have to tell you. It will be worth your while.

56:05.347 --> 56:10.035
You were walking down the street
wearing the clothes you have on your back.

56:10.067 --> 56:11.557
You seem worried.

56:11.587 --> 56:14.557
Kind of like you are right now,
but even more worried.

56:14.627 --> 56:16.709
And you had blood on your face.

56:16.747 --> 56:19.956
I'm not sure why.
Anyway, you were ambling along

56:20.027 --> 56:25.193
and all of a sudden,
your dog Paul passed you by in a bus.

56:27.107 --> 56:31.476
- In a bus?
- Yes, he was seated in a bus.

56:31.547 --> 56:33.515
Like a regular commuter.

56:35.147 --> 56:37.388
Paul saw you walking down the street.

56:37.467 --> 56:40.516
When the bus stopped, Paul got off

56:40.547 --> 56:43.915
and he ran as fast as he could
to be reunited with you.

56:44.267 --> 56:47.111
It was very beautiful and very moving.

56:47.827 --> 56:49.795
Odd, isn't it?

56:50.347 --> 56:52.793
I just had to tell you.

56:52.867 --> 56:54.835
Yeah, it's odd.

56:57.147 --> 57:00.469
So, what was the second thing
you wanted to tell me?

57:24.267 --> 57:27.953
The second thing is that
I have a small favor to ask of you.

57:28.267 --> 57:32.716
One of my clients didn't cope very well
with the disappearance of her dog

57:32.787 --> 57:35.313
and she hastily bought a better one
to fill the void.

57:36.227 --> 57:40.471
Unfortunately, she instantly formed a bond
with the new dog.

57:40.987 --> 57:45.311
And now she won't hear of the old one
which she no longer loves.

57:45.347 --> 57:48.430
And now I have an extra dog on my hands.

57:49.827 --> 57:52.512
In seven years of service,
this has never happened.

57:52.667 --> 57:54.749
I'm really embarrassed.

57:55.547 --> 57:57.356
What do you want me to do about it?

57:57.427 --> 57:58.792
Well, I was thinking,

57:58.867 --> 58:03.475
you could keep the orphan dog at your place
until I find a foster family.

58:03.507 --> 58:06.272
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- I sincerely think it is.

58:06.307 --> 58:08.708
Beyond the favor you would be doing for me,

58:08.787 --> 58:12.997
it would be beneficial to you
while you wait for Paul's return.

58:13.067 --> 58:16.867
And Paul comes back in a bus, is that it?

58:18.107 --> 58:21.077
No, when the top-level detective I've hired
finds him.

58:21.147 --> 58:23.468
Yeah, well, if I may say so, Master Chang,

58:23.507 --> 58:26.238
I don't think that detective
is all that competent.

58:26.307 --> 58:28.992
Rene, bring Joshua in.

58:29.067 --> 58:32.196
Seriously, I'm not interested. Forget about it.

58:33.667 --> 58:37.353
- You should really think about it.
- No need.

58:37.427 --> 58:39.714
Paul's the only one I've ever loved.

58:39.787 --> 58:42.518
Other dogs bore me, so don't insist.

58:42.547 --> 58:44.914
I bet you'll change your mind
once you see Joshua.

58:45.867 --> 58:47.392
I don't think so.

58:52.507 --> 58:53.872
No way.

58:53.947 --> 58:55.631
I'd say "yes" if I were you.

58:55.707 --> 58:59.075
You have no idea the consequences
of what your refusal might be.

58:59.867 --> 59:02.438
Yeah, aren't you the one who says,
"We always have a choice"?

59:03.227 --> 59:04.991
Yes, you always have a choice.

59:09.307 --> 59:11.196
Then it's no.

59:17.787 --> 59:19.152
Thank you.

59:39.907 --> 59:42.592
Excuse me. Is this Dolph's house?

59:42.667 --> 59:44.476
Yes. Why?

59:44.867 --> 59:47.791
Um, just I need to see him.

59:48.507 --> 59:51.271
Do you know when he'll be getting home?

59:51.746 --> 59:53.908
- I'm him.
- What?

59:54.906 --> 59:57.193
I'm Dolph Springer. What do you want?

59:58.146 --> 59:59.910
Really?

59:59.986 --> 01:00:03.195
You just...
You look so different from last time.

01:00:04.586 --> 01:00:06.076
Last time?

01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:08.509
Your face has changed so much.

01:00:09.746 --> 01:00:12.397
I hardly recognize you.

01:00:12.426 --> 01:00:14.793
Dolph, is that you?

01:00:14.866 --> 01:00:16.755
Yeah, I am Dolph.

01:00:16.786 --> 01:00:19.073
Um, do we know each other?

01:00:20.186 --> 01:00:22.348
Honey, it's me.

01:00:22.466 --> 01:00:26.027
I... I left my husband. I'm yours now.

01:00:26.546 --> 01:00:28.514
I belong to you.

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:30.713
What are you talking about?

01:00:30.786 --> 01:00:34.632
You... You can't belong
to somebody who doesn't even know you.

01:00:35.146 --> 01:00:36.307
It doesn't make sense.

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:41.752
No, I know that one night is a short time
to spend together

01:00:41.786 --> 01:00:44.630
and this might feel rushed,

01:00:44.706 --> 01:00:49.553
but I just feel something really strong
between us, Dolph.

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:54.510
God. There you are.

01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:57.512
I recognize your eyes.

01:00:57.626 --> 01:01:02.632
That look. At once mischievous
and completely lost.

01:01:04.706 --> 01:01:07.755
Trust me, we're gonna be so happy together.

01:01:07.826 --> 01:01:11.148
I just... I love you so much already.

01:01:12.826 --> 01:01:14.828
My God.

01:02:18.866 --> 01:02:22.587
Babe? Honey?

01:02:23.026 --> 01:02:25.597
Dolph! Look.

01:02:26.626 --> 01:02:28.628
Have you ever seen one of these?

01:02:29.146 --> 01:02:32.389
It's a trick yo-yo. Look, it doesn't go.

01:02:32.626 --> 01:02:34.594
Okay.

01:02:36.866 --> 01:02:38.072
My God.

01:02:39.986 --> 01:02:42.717
You're gonna love this.
You are gonna love it.

01:02:43.266 --> 01:02:47.954
My dad gave it to me for my 19th birthday.
It is so cute.

01:02:48.546 --> 01:02:50.947
And it gives off the most beautiful glow.

01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:53.588
I'm gonna read.

01:02:54.826 --> 01:02:56.794
Don't you give off a beautiful glow?

01:02:56.866 --> 01:02:58.834
You do. Yes.

01:02:58.906 --> 01:03:01.034
Come on, let's go find a place for you.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.951
Honey?

01:04:05.826 --> 01:04:07.032
Honey?

01:04:08.146 --> 01:04:09.386
Honey?

01:04:10.466 --> 01:04:14.436
Honey, can I use this empty closet
for my gowns?

01:04:14.505 --> 01:04:16.872
It'd be perfect. What do you think?

01:04:17.705 --> 01:04:19.628
Honey, answer me!

01:04:19.665 --> 01:04:21.394
Are you cool, me taking this closet?

01:04:21.585 --> 01:04:23.792
It'd be really convenient.

01:04:25.345 --> 01:04:27.427
Honey? Honey?

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:31.314
- Honey? Answer me!
- Fuck!

01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:33.871
I don't give a shit, okay?

01:04:33.905 --> 01:04:35.395
Just take all the closets.

01:04:35.465 --> 01:04:38.992
I am on phase seven, okay? This is crucial.

01:04:39.025 --> 01:04:41.232
Just leave me the fuck alone.

01:04:44.505 --> 01:04:47.076
Okay, honey, I'm sorry.

01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:49.467
You know, anyway I think I changed my mind.

01:04:49.545 --> 01:04:53.994
And I'm gonna use this closet for my shoes
and I'll use the other one for my clothes.

01:04:54.345 --> 01:04:56.871
It will be easier that way.

01:05:00.225 --> 01:05:01.556
Great. Great.

01:05:10.025 --> 01:05:11.231
DOLPH  Paul.

01:05:12.265 --> 01:05:14.154
Paul, can you hear me?

01:05:15.905 --> 01:05:17.748
Paul!

01:05:20.905 --> 01:05:22.350
Come on.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:24.794
Come here, boy.

01:05:24.985 --> 01:05:26.749
Don't be scared.

01:05:28.825 --> 01:05:30.429
Paul.

01:05:31.585 --> 01:05:34.031
I'm so glad to hear you.

01:05:34.465 --> 01:05:36.229
You're here.

01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:40.836
There, there, okay. Good doggy.

01:05:41.785 --> 01:05:44.755
I missed you so much.

01:05:46.305 --> 01:05:48.307
You wanna come home soon?

01:05:48.385 --> 01:05:49.432
- Dolph?
- Is that it?

01:05:49.465 --> 01:05:51.706
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

01:05:51.785 --> 01:05:53.196
Yeah, that's what...

01:05:53.265 --> 01:05:55.347
- What are you doing, Dolph?
- You're gonna come back.

01:05:55.465 --> 01:05:57.035
- Paul?
- Open your eyes.

01:05:57.105 --> 01:05:59.949
- I have something to say.
- Paul, where are you going? Paul!

01:05:59.985 --> 01:06:02.750
- Look at me.
- Why are you leaving? Paul!

01:06:03.465 --> 01:06:05.115
Dolph, look at me.

01:06:05.945 --> 01:06:07.629
I'm pregnant.

01:06:08.545 --> 01:06:11.151
I'm pregnant with your child.

01:06:11.745 --> 01:06:13.793
You're fucking what?

01:06:14.425 --> 01:06:16.746
Yeah, you did...

01:06:18.905 --> 01:06:21.272
Master Chang's technique worked.

01:06:22.465 --> 01:06:24.593
I completed phase seven.

01:06:25.305 --> 01:06:27.114
I heard him bark. I heard him.

01:06:27.145 --> 01:06:30.149
He... He came to see me. He came to see me.

01:06:30.225 --> 01:06:32.671
I... I could almost smell him.

01:06:35.305 --> 01:06:37.194
Paul came to see me.

01:06:43.145 --> 01:06:45.830
I can't fucking believe it worked.

01:06:45.865 --> 01:06:47.629
Who's Paul?

01:07:04.025 --> 01:07:06.346
- Hi, boss.
- Victor.

01:07:06.465 --> 01:07:08.866
- What are you doing here?
- Well...

01:07:09.665 --> 01:07:12.032
You didn't seem very happy
with the size of the palm tree,

01:07:13.185 --> 01:07:16.906
so I felt bad about it,
like I failed in doing my job or so.

01:07:17.985 --> 01:07:19.828
Then I racked my brains

01:07:19.865 --> 01:07:22.869
and I think I found the solution
to make it look taller.

01:07:22.945 --> 01:07:26.028
Wonderful. How... How are you gonna do it?

01:07:26.105 --> 01:07:27.869
Well, it's quite simple.

01:07:28.065 --> 01:07:31.387
What I'm going to do is, uproot the palm tree,

01:07:31.465 --> 01:07:34.230
create a 3-foot high molehill,

01:07:34.265 --> 01:07:36.347
and then replant it on top of it.

01:07:36.385 --> 01:07:37.591
That way it will look taller.

01:07:39.305 --> 01:07:41.512
That's not a bad idea.

01:07:41.545 --> 01:07:44.151
- I'm looking forward to seeing it.
- Thank you.

01:07:44.225 --> 01:07:46.227
I'm gonna go to work for a couple of hours.

01:07:46.705 --> 01:07:48.753
Good. It will be finished
when you come back from work.

01:07:49.145 --> 01:07:51.147
Okay. Great.

01:07:52.185 --> 01:07:55.428
Um, there's hot coffee in the brewer,
if you'd like.

01:07:56.585 --> 01:07:58.826
Thank you.
You're very kind, boss. Thank you.

01:08:06.385 --> 01:08:07.716
DOlph?

01:08:11.225 --> 01:08:12.590
Honey?

01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:15.316
Honey?

01:08:24.944 --> 01:08:25.946
Have you been up long?

01:08:27.505 --> 01:08:29.587
Hey.

01:08:30.584 --> 01:08:32.871
You've changed again, my love.

01:08:33.464 --> 01:08:35.671
Really? I changed?

01:08:36.144 --> 01:08:37.555
Yes.

01:08:38.104 --> 01:08:39.947
I think I like you better this way.

01:08:49.344 --> 01:08:50.788
Dolph Springer.

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:53.264
Yes.

01:08:55.663 --> 01:08:57.746
Sure. I'm on my way.

01:09:05.783 --> 01:09:06.990
Come in.

01:09:08.863 --> 01:09:09.990
You wanted to see me, boss?

01:09:11.144 --> 01:09:14.193
Yes. Shut the door, we need to talk.

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:19.274
Grab a towel.

01:09:19.304 --> 01:09:21.305
Put water everywhere.

01:09:21.344 --> 01:09:22.675
Sorry.

01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:31.986
All right, yeah. Cover my chair.

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.913
What's going on?

01:09:43.024 --> 01:09:48.747
Dolph, I've received several complaints
from your colleagues.

01:09:48.863 --> 01:09:50.104
It appears as though,

01:09:50.184 --> 01:09:53.586
although you've been
let go three months ago,

01:09:53.663 --> 01:09:59.671
you have continued to come in to work
and have been pretending to work.

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.275
Is that true?

01:10:04.584 --> 01:10:09.750
I'm not hurting anyone
and I'm... I'm keeping to myself.

01:10:10.704 --> 01:10:13.025
You haven't answered my question.

01:10:13.464 --> 01:10:14.875
Yes.

01:10:15.384 --> 01:10:18.035
But I'm only here a couple hours a day

01:10:18.144 --> 01:10:21.865
and my desk is vacant most of the time,

01:10:21.904 --> 01:10:24.748
so I don't see what's the problem in that.

01:10:25.664 --> 01:10:28.110
I'm very discreet.

01:10:28.184 --> 01:10:32.473
And I... I like to pretend to work.

01:10:32.544 --> 01:10:35.514
So, is that a crime?

01:10:38.664 --> 01:10:40.189
It's debatable.

01:10:40.224 --> 01:10:42.431
I don't have a problem with it necessarily,

01:10:42.544 --> 01:10:46.708
but it seems to perturb your coworkers.

01:10:46.744 --> 01:10:50.146
Each time they complain,
they're losing focus and efficiency.

01:10:51.224 --> 01:10:52.908
If it were up to me, you can move in here.

01:10:52.984 --> 01:10:56.955
But my main concern right now
is my business' welfare.

01:10:57.704 --> 01:10:59.274
I do hope you understand.

01:10:59.704 --> 01:11:02.913
You can't fire me
'cause I've already been fired.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:05.834
This is a little bit different, yes.

01:11:05.904 --> 01:11:11.593
I'm ordering you to never set foot here again.

01:11:13.304 --> 01:11:14.430
Okay.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:19.670
I don't ever wanna see you
on the premises again, Dolph.

01:11:20.304 --> 01:11:22.272
Is that clear?

01:11:52.064 --> 01:11:54.032
Fuck!

01:11:59.424 --> 01:12:01.665
I'm sorry. I... I just...

01:12:01.704 --> 01:12:03.991
My mind was elsewhere and I...

01:12:07.904 --> 01:12:09.793
Ronnie would like to see you today.

01:12:09.824 --> 01:12:11.872
He's made some progress
with the investigation.

01:12:11.944 --> 01:12:13.434
He's got a bona fide lead.

01:12:15.344 --> 01:12:17.108
- Ronnie?
- Yes.

01:12:17.664 --> 01:12:20.065
The top-level detective Master Chang hired.

01:12:21.664 --> 01:12:24.634
Okay. Great.

01:12:26.184 --> 01:12:27.948
Here's his address.

01:12:32.024 --> 01:12:33.355
Thanks.

01:13:07.703 --> 01:13:10.912
Hey, honey? What about Jenny?

01:13:12.663 --> 01:13:14.984
- Who?
- Jenny, if it's a girl.

01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:17.351
I don't know her.

01:13:17.863 --> 01:13:20.594
No, I'm asking
what you think of the name.

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:23.826
I don't really know.

01:13:24.343 --> 01:13:26.391
It sounds stupid, I would say.

01:13:26.423 --> 01:13:28.107
Stupid?

01:13:28.183 --> 01:13:29.753
Really?

01:13:29.823 --> 01:13:34.067
Okay, then... Well, if it's a boy,
I really like Oscar.

01:13:34.103 --> 01:13:36.185
What do you think?

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:42.430
Listen, I am busy right now,
so if you can leave...

01:13:43.823 --> 01:13:46.872
But, honey, this is like super important.

01:13:46.903 --> 01:13:52.546
I mean, it says in this book that a first name
predetermines the human being's personality.

01:13:53.103 --> 01:13:56.266
For instance, Bruno is a bad choice.

01:13:56.343 --> 01:14:01.986
Okay, apparently it's been proven
that all Brunos eventually hang themselves.

01:14:02.903 --> 01:14:04.905
You know, I really liked Jenny.

01:14:05.223 --> 01:14:08.511
They're saying here that
they're cheery and normal.

01:14:09.383 --> 01:14:11.431
Are you sure you don't like it?

01:14:13.623 --> 01:14:15.591
Are you even listening to me?

01:14:15.703 --> 01:14:17.546
Of course, yes.

01:14:17.623 --> 01:14:20.672
And what are you doing with those tools?

01:14:22.103 --> 01:14:24.913
I have to build a mound for the palm tree
because it's too short.

01:14:26.903 --> 01:14:28.189
Why?

01:14:29.223 --> 01:14:32.750
I don't know. Sometimes it happens,
it's too short, this one.

01:14:43.983 --> 01:14:45.428
What?

01:14:46.783 --> 01:14:48.148
I... I think this is it.

01:14:49.663 --> 01:14:51.711
- This is what?
- Fuck!

01:14:51.783 --> 01:14:53.626
I think I'm in labor.

01:14:55.063 --> 01:14:57.304
Really? Why?

01:14:57.703 --> 01:15:00.673
I don't know. I don't know how it's possible,
but it's happening.

01:15:02.463 --> 01:15:04.067
It's happening? I don't understand.

01:15:04.343 --> 01:15:07.074
I... I need to get to the beach.

01:15:08.223 --> 01:15:09.907
Now? To the beach?

01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:11.747
No, no, no. No, it's not possible.

01:15:11.823 --> 01:15:14.827
I've not finished the mound, so I'm sorry.

01:15:14.863 --> 01:15:16.706
Very bad timing, sorry.

01:15:16.783 --> 01:15:21.345
No, no, no, Dolph, I've always dreamed
of giving birth on the beach.

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:22.873
So, we... we have to.

01:15:24.183 --> 01:15:25.628
Okay.

01:15:26.383 --> 01:15:27.714
Okay.

01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:33.426
- Does it hurt?
- I love you.

01:15:33.943 --> 01:15:36.184
Can you believe this is happening to us?

01:15:36.263 --> 01:15:38.834
Do you realize how beautiful this is?

01:15:38.863 --> 01:15:40.627
Wow.

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:44.025
I just hope I have enough gas
because my fuel gauge is broken,

01:15:44.103 --> 01:15:47.664
so I never know if I have enough gas or not.

01:16:16.743 --> 01:16:18.233
- Hi.
- May I help you, sir?

01:16:18.263 --> 01:16:21.346
I'm looking for Ronnie, the detective.

01:16:21.423 --> 01:16:22.788
Yes. Follow me.

01:16:33.423 --> 01:16:35.266
Ronnie, you have a visitor.

01:16:35.303 --> 01:16:36.748
Dolph, I was expecting you.

01:16:37.103 --> 01:16:38.264
I know.

01:16:38.303 --> 01:16:39.429
Have a seat.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.430
Just tell me the truth right now.
You haven't found Paul.

01:16:51.463 --> 01:16:53.830
No, I haven't. But any minute now.

01:16:53.903 --> 01:16:56.144
I think you're gonna be very surprised.

01:16:56.223 --> 01:16:59.272
What I'm about to show you
is highly interesting.

01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:01.711
See for yourself.

01:17:13.302 --> 01:17:15.908
What is this? I don't... I don't understand.

01:17:16.702 --> 01:17:18.227
That's Paul.

01:17:18.942 --> 01:17:21.707
What do you mean? I don't see anything.

01:17:22.222 --> 01:17:23.792
Where's Paul?

01:17:24.142 --> 01:17:26.304
That's Paul from the inside.

01:17:26.782 --> 01:17:28.944
- The inside?
- Yes.

01:17:28.982 --> 01:17:31.064
We've accessed the turd's memory.

01:17:31.142 --> 01:17:32.792
The one I picked out from your garden?

01:17:32.822 --> 01:17:36.349
Those are its first memories
from within Paul's intestine.

01:17:37.462 --> 01:17:39.829
I'm sorry, I don't get it.

01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:41.392
Okay, it's very simple.

01:17:41.502 --> 01:17:45.791
I've plugged Paul's shit into a device
that lets me gather data

01:17:45.822 --> 01:17:48.587
and convert that data into video signals.

01:17:48.662 --> 01:17:51.313
Then, I've also plugged it into another device

01:17:51.342 --> 01:17:55.188
which lets me scan
that same shit's subconscious,

01:17:55.222 --> 01:17:57.589
as I please, and record the information.

01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:00.111
Okay, okay.

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:01.707
Wow.

01:18:02.342 --> 01:18:05.949
What we're seeing are Paul's turd's memories.

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:09.353
Yes, that's it, exactly.

01:18:09.422 --> 01:18:11.709
I've taped it all on cassette.

01:18:13.142 --> 01:18:14.951
Incredible.

01:18:15.702 --> 01:18:18.706
Anything is possible
with technology nowadays.

01:18:19.302 --> 01:18:20.872
Well, why is the image so bad?

01:18:21.102 --> 01:18:23.230
It's an old monitor. Don't worry about that.

01:18:23.342 --> 01:18:27.711
Okay, um, and... and what are those numbers?

01:18:27.782 --> 01:18:30.706
You can see them right there, here.

01:18:31.542 --> 01:18:35.228
That's the date and the time.
It's 7:12, the day Paul disappeared.

01:18:35.942 --> 01:18:38.343
I think you're still asleep.

01:18:38.902 --> 01:18:40.791
Paul is alone in the yard.

01:18:40.862 --> 01:18:42.944
Yeah, I... I usually sleep later than that.

01:18:43.062 --> 01:18:45.110
And how do you know he's in the yard?

01:18:45.182 --> 01:18:48.072
- Let me fast-forward, I'll show you.
- Okay.

01:19:02.622 --> 01:19:06.866
There. It's now 7:25
and the turd is nearing the exit.

01:19:07.782 --> 01:19:09.113
Can you turn the volume up?

01:19:09.182 --> 01:19:10.991
No, there's no audio.

01:19:13.182 --> 01:19:17.392
It's now 7:26,
and the turd has exited Paul's body.

01:19:18.342 --> 01:19:19.707
Yes.

01:19:19.742 --> 01:19:23.064
We are no longer inside Paul,
but on the grass in your yard.

01:19:23.942 --> 01:19:27.151
And there's your dog who
just finished serving his bodily functions.

01:19:27.222 --> 01:19:28.667
Paul.

01:19:28.742 --> 01:19:30.790
Yes, that's him.

01:19:31.782 --> 01:19:33.830
God, it's so good to see him.

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:36.348
Now, pay attention to what happens next.

01:19:36.422 --> 01:19:38.709
It all happens very fast.

01:19:38.782 --> 01:19:41.262
You see that van in the back over there?

01:19:41.342 --> 01:19:42.343
Yes.

01:19:43.062 --> 01:19:45.872
Look carefully at what's about to happen.

01:19:49.582 --> 01:19:53.951
There. Did you see it?
Paul has been kidnapped.

01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:56.626
Yeah, I know.

01:19:56.942 --> 01:20:00.628
Now, the good news is,
I have been able to zoom in

01:20:00.702 --> 01:20:03.911
on the front of the van
and recover the license plate number.

01:20:03.942 --> 01:20:06.912
And I'd say we're only a couple days away

01:20:06.942 --> 01:20:11.266
from nailing that fucker and finding Paul.

01:20:11.302 --> 01:20:13.623
Wait, hold on.

01:20:13.982 --> 01:20:16.792
What... What do you mean you know?

01:20:18.342 --> 01:20:19.389
I know.

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.029
What do you know?

01:20:22.662 --> 01:20:24.744
I know Paul's been kidnapped.

01:20:26.702 --> 01:20:28.545
Are you fucking with me right now?

01:20:29.222 --> 01:20:31.668
No. I thought you knew.

01:20:32.822 --> 01:20:35.348
You didn't... You didn't tell me?

01:20:36.942 --> 01:20:38.512
Why did I bother investigating then?

01:20:38.582 --> 01:20:41.472
Well, I thought Master Chang would tell you.

01:20:41.502 --> 01:20:43.823
Well, he didn't. He just said to find your dog.

01:20:43.902 --> 01:20:45.984
Are you fucking with me right now?

01:20:46.022 --> 01:20:48.184
You should've told me.

01:20:48.262 --> 01:20:50.071
You're the detective.

01:20:51.622 --> 01:20:53.351
Fuck!

01:20:53.422 --> 01:20:55.026
I'm the detective...

01:20:55.622 --> 01:20:58.193
Ronnie, sorry to interrupt.
Master Chang just called.

01:20:58.262 --> 01:21:00.583
He said to drop the Adolf Springer case.

01:21:00.662 --> 01:21:01.993
What?

01:21:02.022 --> 01:21:05.390
Actually it's Dolph Springer, it's not Adolf.

01:21:05.462 --> 01:21:07.863
Right, sorry. Dolph Springer.

01:21:07.942 --> 01:21:12.345
Master Chang said not to pursue
and he asked that you cease the investigation.

01:21:12.382 --> 01:21:15.704
Fuck! Why? Did he say why?

01:21:15.782 --> 01:21:20.344
It seems Mr. Adolf refused
to do him a small favor and it peeved him.

01:21:20.382 --> 01:21:23.545
Are you fucking kidding me? Who does that?

01:21:23.582 --> 01:21:26.825
You don't halt an investigation
halfway through it.

01:21:26.862 --> 01:21:29.387
Shit! Is he going to pay us or not?

01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:32.023
I... I sent the second invoice yesterday.

01:21:32.061 --> 01:21:34.143
Master Chang's accountant
didn't seem too pleased.

01:21:34.221 --> 01:21:35.711
I'm worried they might stiff us.

01:21:36.341 --> 01:21:39.663
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

01:21:40.901 --> 01:21:44.383
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!
Fucking cocksucker!

01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:49.871
I told you to get that invoice approved
by that bitch ahead of time.

01:21:50.381 --> 01:21:52.748
Shit! Shit!

01:21:52.781 --> 01:21:54.067
Motherfucker!

01:21:54.541 --> 01:21:55.781
Take it easy.

01:21:56.061 --> 01:21:59.952
You... This is all your fault.

01:22:00.381 --> 01:22:03.590
You are never gonna find your fucking dog.

01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:06.507
Never! Now get the hell out of here!

01:23:40.341 --> 01:23:43.868
Daddy, Daddy, look what I found.
Isn't it great?

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:46.352
What is this?

01:23:46.381 --> 01:23:48.145
Is it an urchin?

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:51.262
No, it's not an urchin.

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:53.829
What is it then?

01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:55.226
Well...

01:23:55.661 --> 01:23:57.709
It's difficult to explain.

01:23:57.981 --> 01:23:59.710
Is it a starfish?

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.463
No, I don't think so, kid.

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.543
Don't call him "kid".

01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:06.185
It's weird.

01:24:07.701 --> 01:24:09.783
Sorry, son.

01:24:10.861 --> 01:24:14.024
I don't want to be a gardener when I grow up,
it sucks.

01:24:14.101 --> 01:24:16.581
It's a broken wine bottle.

01:24:17.061 --> 01:24:19.428
Yes, that's what it is.

01:24:19.501 --> 01:24:20.741
What's it for?

01:24:20.821 --> 01:24:22.710
Well, when it's not broken,

01:24:22.741 --> 01:24:25.312
you put liquid in it
and then you drink that liquid.

01:24:25.381 --> 01:24:27.065
Okay.

01:24:36.861 --> 01:24:38.272
Daddy! Daddy!

01:24:45.181 --> 01:24:46.751
Daddy! Daddy!

01:24:47.061 --> 01:24:49.905
I've always dreamed
of giving birth on the beach.

01:25:40.781 --> 01:25:43.022
You gonna get on?

01:25:43.101 --> 01:25:45.024
Changed my mind.

01:25:45.621 --> 01:25:50.182
I had every intention of boarding
when I raised my hand a moment ago.

01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.388
But I don't want to anymore.

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:55.744
What made you change your mind
so suddenly?

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.141
I don't like you, that's what.

01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:02.183
You don't even know me.

01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:05.104
I've seen enough to make an assessment.

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.108
It's no use coaxing me.

01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.625
Once my mind's made up, I never waver.

01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.268
I'll take the next one.

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.390
Okay.

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:23.901
Come on, darling.

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:31.151
Beautiful.

01:28:34.220 --> 01:28:35.665
Very moving.

01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:40.422
Good. We can go now.

01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:42.663
Okay, Master.

01:28:43.460 --> 01:28:45.144
What is next?

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:49.509
Mrs. Weller is reuniting with her cat
in 15 minutes, not far from here.

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.981
Okay, let's go there.

01:28:53.340 --> 01:28:54.580
I like her.

01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:58.548
Mike, it's me.
You're not gonna believe this.

01:29:58.620 --> 01:30:00.861
I found Paul.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:02.311
Call me back as soon as you can.

01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.906
I have to tell you about it. I'm so relieved.

01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:07.466
I hope your trip is going well.

01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:10.466
I'm waiting for your call. Bye.
