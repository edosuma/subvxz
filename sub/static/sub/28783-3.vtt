Who needs an app?

00:25.660 --> 00:26.960
This is my life.

00:36.160 --> 00:37.770
How are you two?

00:39.060 --> 00:40.360
Hi.

00:45.020 --> 00:47.210
Proposed redundancies?

00:49.660 --> 00:51.659
Drakes, Cobley...

00:51.660 --> 00:52.960
Me?

00:53.460 --> 00:54.760
Morning.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.660
Jesus...

00:58.460 --> 01:01.620
They're...
They're just proposals.

01:02.760 --> 01:04.060
Aren't they?

01:20.160 --> 01:21.469
All right?

01:21.470 --> 01:22.959
What's up?

01:22.960 --> 01:24.660
I'm meant to be taking
him for a biopsy.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.429
His name's Ralph.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.739
Ralph Walsh.
He's 87.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.990
A nice old boy. I've
been knocking, but no answer.

01:31.450 --> 01:33.709
Ralph?
Ralph, it's the police.

01:33.710 --> 01:36.110
We're going to have to break in.
There might be some noise.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.260
Here, pass us that brick,
Drake.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.620
Old folk, hey?

01:45.480 --> 01:47.049
Ralph?

01:47.050 --> 01:49.000
Ralph?
Are you in here, mate?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.890
Just give us a minute, yeah?

01:53.760 --> 01:56.270
<i>- Ralph?
- Mr. Walsh?</i>

01:57.160 --> 01:59.460
<i>Are you all right, mate?
Ralph, it's the police.</i>

02:05.910 --> 02:07.490
Sorry, Sean.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.038
"Islands In The Stream",

02:11.039 --> 02:13.159
"Up Where We Belong",
"Don't Give Up".

02:13.160 --> 02:14.580
It's all duets.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.199
Poor sod.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.769
His Dolly Parton departed.

02:18.770 --> 02:20.290
The old boy was RAF.

02:22.460 --> 02:23.910
Right, Ralph,
are you in here?

02:29.960 --> 02:31.959
Shit...

02:31.960 --> 02:33.540
He's been robbed!

02:34.140 --> 02:35.760
Tell me about it.

02:38.850 --> 02:40.209
The old loop and tug.

02:40.210 --> 02:42.900
A coat hanger through
to the latch and you're in.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.859
Why don't they fit
bloody deadlocks?

02:45.860 --> 02:49.150
Well, when Ralph gets home from
wherever he is, you can ask him.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.750
No wonder the old folks around
here are always getting robbed.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.890
The burglar's left us a present.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.260
We're going to get this little toerag.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.959
<i>This weekend, the Boston
Historic And Antiques Show,</i>

03:07.960 --> 03:11.609
<i>a celebration of Lincolnshire's
past.</i>

03:11.610 --> 03:13.159
<i>Come and see the spectacular...</i>

03:13.160 --> 03:15.339
.. things nobody wants
or needs any more.

03:15.340 --> 03:16.899
Grandpa would like it.

03:16.900 --> 03:19.500
You know, it's not too late
to send him a birthday card.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.269
I'll get it.

03:22.270 --> 03:24.260
The last mailing day
is Thursday!

03:26.260 --> 03:28.089
600 job cuts over four years.

03:28.090 --> 03:30.099
Do you care to comment,
Chief Constable?

03:30.100 --> 03:31.959
Wait... Where did you
get that information?

03:31.960 --> 03:34.610
Your redundancy proposals
were leaked last night.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.600
Hi, Mr. Hixon.

03:36.960 --> 03:38.570
Nice jimjams.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.559
Dad, this is Astrid. We're
going to get the bus together.

03:42.560 --> 03:44.510
Unless you have any objections...

03:44.860 --> 03:46.699
Did Grandpa judge your friends,
too?

03:46.700 --> 03:49.600
He put some of my friends
in front of an actual judge.

03:51.360 --> 03:53.199
How many beat cops are
going to lose their jobs

03:53.200 --> 03:54.959
because of your DNA thingy?

03:54.960 --> 03:57.319
You've already cut
night shifts by 40%.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.039
The custody suite in Skegvegas

03:59.040 --> 04:01.159
isn't even manned
on a Saturday night.

04:01.160 --> 04:02.750
I mean,
<i>Saturday night!</i>

04:03.960 --> 04:06.490
<i>You're going to have to speak
to me sooner or later, William.</i>

04:13.610 --> 04:16.119
Muriel, you're going to be all
right. You're still young.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.459
You've got transferable skills.
What about me, hey?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.999
Hey, Ralph Walsh.
Old person.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.959
Breaking and entry at Fenmarsh.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.169
He's probably staying
with his sister in Grimsby

04:25.170 --> 04:27.429
or he might be playing
hide the Spitfire

04:27.430 --> 04:29.099
with one of the old widow wenches.

04:29.100 --> 04:31.469
What? Even my old dad
cleans up at Fenmarsh.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.799
He's an ugly bastard.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.709
- Was there much taken?
- It looks like it, yeah.

04:34.710 --> 04:36.489
Empty jewellery boxes,
draws pulled out.

04:36.490 --> 04:39.149
We got a glove, though. The
lab's squeezing it for DNA juice.

04:39.150 --> 04:42.640
- So, we got a DNA hit?
- Do you hear a noise, Muriel?

04:43.360 --> 04:46.609
Sounds a bit like someone
castrating a ferret.

04:46.610 --> 04:48.959
And you'd know exactly what
that sounds like, wouldn't you?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.559
Is it true?
The cuts?

04:51.560 --> 04:53.559
The redundancies aren't finalised.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.779
- This process is going to take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

04:55.780 --> 04:59.119
- So, DNA. Yes? No?
- Yes, Muriel.

04:59.120 --> 05:00.919
The labs say they've got a hit.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.229
Great.

05:02.230 --> 05:05.169
Send it my way.
It's exactly what I need.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.019
I know exactly what you need.

05:07.020 --> 05:09.829
Let's catch this guy quick
and make it a good news day.

05:09.830 --> 05:12.090
Why do you care so much?
It's only a burglary.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.179
- Don't worry.
- Cheers.

05:14.180 --> 05:16.130
I'll see what I can find at Ralph's.

05:16.960 --> 05:20.070
<i>Grandma's frisky,
number 60.</i>

05:24.900 --> 05:27.689
Chief Constable Bill Hixon,
serving the community.

05:27.690 --> 05:29.580
You're on a lucky streak.

05:30.560 --> 05:33.559
I got your message. You really want
to talk about police job cuts here?

05:33.560 --> 05:36.119
Yes. And I realise that Lisa
doesn't want a boring story,

05:36.120 --> 05:37.479
she wants a real story.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.519
Like, "Boston pensioners
still going strong."

05:40.520 --> 05:42.979
"They fought a war and they
don't need Bill Hixon."

05:42.980 --> 05:44.339
Print any of them.

05:44.340 --> 05:46.679
"Boston pensioners'
safety sacrificed

05:46.680 --> 05:49.249
"to fund top cop's supercomputer."

05:49.250 --> 05:51.329
Supercomputer?
This isn't 1979.

05:51.330 --> 05:54.059
It's a database.
How about this for a story...?

05:54.060 --> 05:58.129
"Octogenarian Ralph Walsh,
home robbed, ransacked.

05:58.130 --> 06:01.049
"Watch 21st-century
tech catch who did it."

06:01.050 --> 06:04.429
What, so you're saying that your DNA thing,
that that's going to catch the thief?

06:04.430 --> 06:05.739
Is that a promise?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.399
Promises are for children,
Lisa.

06:07.400 --> 06:08.759
- OK, so, Bill...
- Excuse me.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.339
<i>Rise and shine, 29.</i>

06:11.340 --> 06:13.479
Yes, Muriel.
Give me the good news.

06:13.480 --> 06:15.289
Have you got our suspect in custody?

06:15.290 --> 06:16.699
A touch of Chinese whispers.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.199
The DNA isn't on file.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.679
Muriel, I need this.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.239
Cobley said you had a match.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.089
Yeah, well, Cobley says a lot of things.

06:23.090 --> 06:24.919
<i>The best we've got
is a partial match</i>

06:24.920 --> 06:27.220
<i>to someone who works
at Boston Library.</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:36.699
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Alma Smith.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.919
Smith comma Alma.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.239
Chick lit.

06:41.240 --> 06:42.969
Nothing coming up.
Sorry.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.399
You're Alma Smith.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.239
I take my laughs
where I can get them.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.049
You're...
Canadian.

06:48.050 --> 06:49.659
American.

06:49.660 --> 06:50.969
I knew that.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.919
I just don't like insulting
people to their faces.

06:53.920 --> 06:56.000
I'm Chief Constable Bill Hixon.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.159
Are you OK?

06:58.160 --> 06:59.869
I felt amazing
at happy hour.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.179
This morning...

07:01.180 --> 07:02.559
.. not so much.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.779
Hey, hey, Shelley, love.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.330
That plastic shatters.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.340
All right, I'm going to take that.

07:10.140 --> 07:11.640
But I'll give you that.

07:13.260 --> 07:15.719
You're good with kids.
Do you have any?

07:15.720 --> 07:17.459
No, it's just me.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.929
No nieces, nephews, nothing.

07:19.930 --> 07:22.459
Not even a cat.
Is this leading somewhere?

07:22.460 --> 07:24.339
- Are you all right, Bernie?
- Yeah.

07:24.340 --> 07:27.099
- Re-shelf them returns for me, will you?
- Sure.

07:27.100 --> 07:30.700
You were cautioned a few weeks
ago about harassing a PCSO.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.719
It was a demo against the library cuts.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.029
And I didn't harass him.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.769
I might have puked on him a little.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.870
This was also after happy hour?

07:40.580 --> 07:43.549
When you were at the station,
your DNA was put on file.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.410
- It's a permanent programme.
- I know, I read The Stump.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.129
So, what have I done now?

07:50.130 --> 07:51.430
It's not you.

07:52.060 --> 07:55.559
But your DNA was a partial
match to a crime scene.

07:55.560 --> 07:58.290
- I don't follow.
- We're looking for your father.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.760
Join the fucking queue.

08:08.330 --> 08:10.859
- Still no sign?
- No.

08:10.860 --> 08:12.279
Is the bedroom down here?

08:12.280 --> 08:15.099
<i>There was this guy, John,</i>
Joe maybe.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.999
He used to hang around the
flat when I was little.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.759
And you think he might
have been your father?

08:18.760 --> 08:21.879
He was my dad, but Mum didn't tell
me about him until she was dying.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.830
Too late by then,
he was gone for good.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.590
He didn't even leave his
name on my birth certificate.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.740
Actually, you know what?

08:33.360 --> 08:34.659
This...

08:36.880 --> 08:39.559
.. is pretty much the
last time that I saw him.

08:41.919 --> 08:44.009
Got your work cut out,
haven't you, if he's...

08:44.010 --> 08:45.469
had a haircut
or got lenses?

08:45.470 --> 08:47.120
He could be anyone by now.

08:48.560 --> 08:50.090
So, what's he done, then?

08:50.560 --> 08:51.869
John.

08:51.870 --> 08:53.850
- Or Joe.
- Burglary.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.870
You were expecting something different?

08:58.520 --> 08:59.829
Well...

08:59.830 --> 09:02.860
From the stories I've heard about him,
I was expecting something worse.

09:09.160 --> 09:12.250
<i>- Has anyone checked the garage?
- Not yet, no.</i>

09:15.360 --> 09:16.660
Chest freezer.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.399
No, I'm not opening that.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.519
I've got form with freezers
and body parts.

09:24.520 --> 09:25.820
Jesus...

09:27.060 --> 09:29.300
Give me a hand with
all this crap, Drakes.

09:37.260 --> 09:38.950
It's all right, he's not in here.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.700
I know.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.639
<i>Hey,
let me get my head round this.</i>

09:53.640 --> 09:55.589
You promised the media
that your DNA database

09:55.590 --> 09:57.659
would catch a burglar.
It hasn't.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.219
And now we're looking
for a killer.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.989
It's very cute, you called
The Stump "the media".

10:01.990 --> 10:03.379
Keith won't find it cute.

10:03.380 --> 10:06.139
Pensioners are his core electorate.
He's big at Fenmarsh.

10:06.140 --> 10:07.799
You'd better be on your
way to nab the bastard.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.619
Lydia, I'm not really
in the nabbing business.

10:10.620 --> 10:12.679
I promise you, progress
is being made somewhere.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.359
We don't even have a
current ID for this guy.

10:14.360 --> 10:17.059
Father of Alma Smith,
possibly called John or Joe.

10:17.060 --> 10:18.690
No-one's seen him in 15 years.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.699
Where the bloody hell are you going?

10:21.700 --> 10:24.119
They're your cuts.
Face the music.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.309
I'm letting the music
seep in a little.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.819
Nobody likes a song the
first time they hear it.

10:28.820 --> 10:31.769
Well, it's not the first time I've
heard it. And I still don't like it.

10:31.770 --> 10:34.220
DNA WILL CATCH KILLER OF HERO
PENSIONER. I PROMISE!

10:35.060 --> 10:36.510
I didn't promise.

10:51.760 --> 10:54.110
<i>Pathology says his heart went.</i>

10:54.460 --> 10:55.789
But what caused it to go?

10:55.790 --> 10:58.419
One more pill, one less,
a hand over the mouth...

10:58.420 --> 11:01.459
I mean, even a good hard shout
in his ear might have pushed it.

11:01.460 --> 11:03.459
But then, where we found him...

11:03.460 --> 11:06.459
Ralph didn't roll himself
up in that carpet.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.150
Thank you for this.

11:08.460 --> 11:10.650
You knew him from the library?

11:10.980 --> 11:12.979
History and stuff.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.979
Mainly world wars.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.550
It's this way, love.

11:25.980 --> 11:27.780
That's Ralph Walsh.

11:29.160 --> 11:31.510
I think you'd better
find my dad, don't you?

11:34.160 --> 11:36.459
Pre-trial interview terminated.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.460
Time 14:23.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.919
You will be arraigned
next Thursday.

11:41.920 --> 11:44.980
Come on, why am I really here, Detective?

11:47.460 --> 11:50.639
Do you know him? Last
seen about 15 years ago.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.049
Old-school housebreaker,
a broken window,

11:53.050 --> 11:55.459
coat hanger, loop and tug.

11:55.460 --> 11:57.570
Enjoying this, aren't you, Yeardsley?

11:58.250 --> 12:00.360
I heard about the redundancies.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.560
It looks like I got out
just in time.

12:04.460 --> 12:06.359
I'd still rather be me.

12:06.360 --> 12:09.459
You know, walking out of here tonight.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.189
Hixon's a
"see you next Tuesday".

12:12.190 --> 12:14.819
He'll end up in Miami
Beach. What about you?

12:14.820 --> 12:18.190
Selling candyfloss on Cleethorpes Pier.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.210
Our friend's impressed with you.

12:22.460 --> 12:24.420
He helps those who help him.

12:24.750 --> 12:27.459
His companies need security advisers,

12:27.460 --> 12:28.769
maybe even a head of security...

12:28.770 --> 12:30.189
Do you recognise him or not?

12:30.190 --> 12:32.710
You've got something Oleg wants.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.619
You took that coffee cup, didn't you?

12:35.620 --> 12:37.580
I went back for it,
it wasn't there.

12:38.060 --> 12:41.619
That cup could give me
cause for a mistrial.

12:41.620 --> 12:43.459
Hixon's screwed with evidence.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.460
It could save both our skins.

12:46.460 --> 12:47.760
Wait!

12:50.660 --> 12:53.619
We lifted a loop and tug mid-'90s.

12:53.620 --> 12:56.390
Notorious housebreaker, he was.

12:57.980 --> 13:00.159
No swabs then.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.469
He liked to pick on the oldies.

13:02.470 --> 13:05.699
Check the arrest files for August '94.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.990
Look for Henry Reeves.

13:08.550 --> 13:10.700
Do your homework, Clarice.

13:24.950 --> 13:26.800
I don't think she's
going to press charges.

13:27.460 --> 13:30.359
- It was her sister who hit her.
- We're not here for that.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.419
You want a statement.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.949
I heard about poor Ralph.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.600
Poor Ralph, is it?
Come on.

13:37.060 --> 13:39.469
I'm Henry Reeves, but that's not me.

13:39.470 --> 13:40.979
Look,
I've kept my bib clean for years.

13:40.980 --> 13:45.079
Yeah, well, your signature's all over it.
Old people, a wire coat hanger, the lot.

13:45.080 --> 13:47.069
You've trimmed your beard
and lost your glasses,

13:47.070 --> 13:49.350
but temptation doesn't leave,
does it?

13:49.740 --> 13:52.389
Maybe Ralph was already
dead when you broke in.

13:52.390 --> 13:54.049
So you helped yourself.
Why not?

13:54.050 --> 13:56.650
And then you called us.
Just tell us what happened.

13:56.980 --> 13:58.850
- It's still not me.
- Prove it.

13:59.260 --> 14:01.239
Once I get onto that system,
I'll never get off.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.849
I know you lot.

14:02.850 --> 14:05.319
<i>999 call, altercation,
possible stabbing.</i>

14:05.320 --> 14:08.959
- Look, we've got urgent call-outs.
- I don't care if the whole town croaks.

14:08.960 --> 14:10.669
There's only one way out of here,
Henry.

14:10.670 --> 14:12.880
Was it John back then or Joe?

14:18.310 --> 14:19.610
JonJo.

14:20.150 --> 14:21.729
JonJo Ryan.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.419
That's his name.

14:23.420 --> 14:24.819
I knew him.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.819
JonJo taught me
all the tricks.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.529
He was a real pro.

14:28.530 --> 14:30.669
So, I got caught, he didn't.

14:30.670 --> 14:33.419
JonJo Ryan?
So you were his accomplice.

14:33.420 --> 14:35.659
Funny you didn't mention
it back then.

14:35.660 --> 14:37.960
If you knew JonJo,
you wouldn't either.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.300
I ain't seen him since.

14:41.820 --> 14:43.720
So, he's back.

14:44.460 --> 14:45.960
And killing now.

14:51.160 --> 14:53.160
<i>Jesus, what time is it?</i>

14:55.390 --> 14:56.690
I've got to go.

14:58.460 --> 15:00.770
I don't think Grandpa likes me.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.829
That's the first
Lord Harborough.

15:03.830 --> 15:06.389
He led Henry VIII's
massed troops

15:06.390 --> 15:08.419
against a handful
of unarmed monks

15:08.420 --> 15:10.539
who had previously
occupied this area

15:10.540 --> 15:12.509
of prime real estate.

15:12.510 --> 15:15.710
So, your family stole
this land from God?

15:16.430 --> 15:18.789
When Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries,

15:18.790 --> 15:20.459
only Lincolnshire fought back.

15:20.460 --> 15:24.589
Henry called it "the most brute
and beastly shire in the realm".

15:24.590 --> 15:27.370
Then he never saw Skegness
on a Saturday night.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.459
There is a kind
of Harborough look.

15:30.460 --> 15:32.050
If you get rid of the beard.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.459
Nice detective work, Chief Hixon.

15:34.460 --> 15:38.550
Unfortunately, my own origins are
rather more brute and beastly.

15:39.460 --> 15:43.350
Yeah? An illicit affair between
a chambermaid and a 13th Duke?

15:44.460 --> 15:45.820
Adopted.

15:46.860 --> 15:49.109
So, you see, we do have
something in common.

15:49.110 --> 15:52.449
Neither of us quite knows
where we belong.

15:52.450 --> 15:54.650
You never seem out
of place to me.

16:04.460 --> 16:06.369
You're doing that staring thing again.

16:06.370 --> 16:08.129
Either you're getting a
reflection off that glass

16:08.130 --> 16:09.799
or you're feeling guilty
about something.

16:09.800 --> 16:13.059
Reading Alma's file.
She was only ten when her mother died.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.470
No dad.

16:14.820 --> 16:16.129
No family.

16:16.130 --> 16:18.319
So, she would have
gone to foster care.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.859
What would that look like here?

16:19.860 --> 16:22.189
Well, there are good stories.

16:22.190 --> 16:25.400
- And... not such good stories.
- Yeah.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.589
<i>Graduation Day.
Proud of you, son. Love Mom.</i>

16:28.590 --> 16:29.890
Dads...

16:32.160 --> 16:33.460
So...

16:33.840 --> 16:35.360
Do we have our killer?

16:52.460 --> 16:54.810
So, this is where they've been
hiding the nightlife?

16:55.260 --> 16:57.519
- Well, it is on Tuesdays.
- Lager.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.650
I just get two
for one on spirits.

17:02.060 --> 17:04.710
The guy you arrested.

17:05.220 --> 17:06.760
Has he coughed for it yet?

17:07.460 --> 17:10.459
The right MO,
the right age,

17:10.460 --> 17:13.159
the right myopia.
But...

17:13.160 --> 17:14.569
it's not him.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.990
I didn't think it was.

17:17.780 --> 17:20.480
I know Henry.
He drinks in here.

17:21.740 --> 17:24.300
- He's not my dad.
- No, he's not.

17:24.960 --> 17:26.409
And forensics proves it.

17:26.410 --> 17:28.459
He's exactly who he says he is.

17:28.460 --> 17:30.459
A reformed robber.

17:30.460 --> 17:32.719
He knew your dad, JonJo.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.460
They robbed houses together.

17:36.060 --> 17:39.040
I didn't know you were so
young when you lost your mom.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.619
Was I under some obligation
to tell you?

17:42.620 --> 17:43.920
No.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.600
Sorry.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.459
You grow up and learn.
You...

17:48.460 --> 17:50.800
.. learn to keep your stuff to yourself.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.040
Have you and your missus got kids?

17:53.980 --> 17:56.370
A daughter, 14.

17:57.460 --> 17:58.760
And the missus...

18:00.100 --> 18:01.460
Is missed.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.460
Yeah, I can tell.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.960
It's good you've got each other.

18:09.460 --> 18:10.760
So...

18:11.460 --> 18:12.769
What now?

18:12.770 --> 18:14.679
We got your dad's DNA
from the glove.

18:14.680 --> 18:16.509
We'll keep looking.

18:16.510 --> 18:19.059
So, if something happens,
I'll let you know.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.930
- Is that it?
- For now.

18:39.160 --> 18:40.460
<i>Kelsey!</i>

18:46.520 --> 18:49.370
Gramp's birthday Card.
Sign it! Last mail today!

18:57.040 --> 18:58.349
Alma called.

18:58.350 --> 19:00.459
What you said last
night jogged her memory.

19:00.460 --> 19:03.610
She thinks there's a recent
death that might be suspicious.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.459
<i>It's out in Fenmarsh,</i>

19:05.460 --> 19:07.469
<i>the same place Ralph Walsh lived.</i>

19:07.470 --> 19:09.820
<i>It might be we've missed
another murder.</i>

19:11.460 --> 19:15.150
Welcome to Fenmarsh. Home to
the elderly and housebound.

19:15.760 --> 19:17.759
Which may or may not explain

19:17.760 --> 19:19.719
why the most popular
loan every month

19:19.720 --> 19:21.570
is bleeding Pet Cemetery.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.159
This is Nora.

19:24.160 --> 19:27.809
Just tell them, Nora, what
you told me about Stanley.

19:27.810 --> 19:32.289
Well, I came in from Aldi,
and he was lying just there.

19:32.290 --> 19:34.089
All twisted, like.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.979
The report says the attic ladder was down.

19:36.980 --> 19:40.139
They think he tried to climb
it and his heart gave out.

19:40.140 --> 19:42.669
Can I ask, was he buried?

19:42.670 --> 19:45.659
We could do an autopsy, see if
there's anything suspicious.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.209
We burned him.

19:47.210 --> 19:49.119
Six weeks ago,
Thursday.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.629
And I baked him into bits and pieces.

19:51.630 --> 19:53.970
I heard it on Loose Women.

19:55.000 --> 19:57.459
It helps you feel
he's still with you.

19:57.460 --> 20:00.060
Not those biscuits, though.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.830
At least,
I don't think so.

20:06.060 --> 20:09.019
And it was around the time
Stanley died you were burgled?

20:09.020 --> 20:10.659
I think so.

20:10.660 --> 20:14.460
But it's all a bit of a blur,
you know, with what happened.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.469
He never went up there.

20:17.470 --> 20:19.880
No matter how much
I nagged him to.

20:20.460 --> 20:23.129
I just don't understand.

20:23.130 --> 20:26.780
Do you think someone did
something to my Stanley?

20:29.340 --> 20:31.829
- What do you think?
- I think it's just what it looks like.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.389
He climbed the ladder,
had a heart attack.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.820
Sir...
I think you need to see this.

20:38.460 --> 20:40.119
It's the same as at Ralph's.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.050
Classic loop and tug.

20:45.100 --> 20:47.479
Cut the window, stick
a coat hanger through.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.799
Whoever it is is clearly
targeting old folk.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.769
That is definitely not Nora's.

20:52.770 --> 20:55.080
The same MO as Ralph, sir.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.260
Shit.

21:06.630 --> 21:09.359
Forensics from the two
crime scenes match, sir.

21:09.360 --> 21:12.619
The DNA's back from the hair
follicles. It's JonJo again.

21:12.620 --> 21:13.920
Alma's dad.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.029
So,
we have two possible victims,

21:17.030 --> 21:18.919
Ralph Walsh and Stanley Green.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.519
Well, so far, sir. Who knows
how many there might be?

21:21.520 --> 21:23.299
It's the tip of the iceberg.

21:23.300 --> 21:25.460
We might have missed loads of others.

21:26.360 --> 21:28.719
Is this really happening, Bill?

21:28.720 --> 21:31.159
Well, I don't know.
In the Sartrean sense

21:31.160 --> 21:32.719
or the Nietzschean sense?
Yes,

21:32.720 --> 21:34.709
your size sevens are on my desk.

21:34.710 --> 21:37.319
And, yes, we have a murderer
who's preying on seniors.

21:37.320 --> 21:39.079
Why couldn't the toerag
target junkies

21:39.080 --> 21:42.049
or children too young to vote?

21:42.050 --> 21:43.989
What leads do you have?

21:43.990 --> 21:46.049
Well, we know who he is, we
just don't know where he is.

21:46.050 --> 21:48.019
No.
Nobody knows.

21:48.020 --> 21:49.559
In an age of Snapchat,

21:49.560 --> 21:52.419
where I can send pictures of my
genitals to anybody in the world,

21:52.420 --> 21:54.359
we can't find one bearded scrote

21:54.360 --> 21:56.899
in the least populated
region of England.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.499
I mean, somebody doesn't completely
disappear just like that, do they?

22:00.500 --> 22:02.990
We do a record.
Bloody ridiculous.

22:03.880 --> 22:05.459
And this is on you, by the way.

22:05.460 --> 22:07.469
You and your bloody
stupid promises.

22:07.470 --> 22:09.479
- I didn't promise.
- Yes, you did.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.880
I did not!

22:13.360 --> 22:14.660
You did.

22:15.360 --> 22:16.880
I didn't promise!

22:20.960 --> 22:23.100
Who the hell are you, JonJo?

22:30.360 --> 22:31.909
Every time, Dad.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.830
Every time someone knocks...

22:35.250 --> 22:37.299
.. you put this on.
Yeah?

22:37.300 --> 22:39.319
- Yeah.
- And...

22:39.320 --> 22:40.859
- .. double lock.
- Got it.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.169
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:42.170 --> 22:43.629
- Have you got it?
- Yes!

22:43.630 --> 22:46.360
OK.
I've got to go.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.939
I was told you were back here.

23:05.940 --> 23:08.050
Are you still telling
it like it is, Lisa?

23:08.360 --> 23:10.519
What's the headline today?

23:10.520 --> 23:13.119
"Old folks too scared
to go to seniors' bingo

23:13.120 --> 23:16.860
"after two OAPs murdered
by a night-time raider."

23:17.360 --> 23:19.239
It's not true.
Don't write it.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.549
What part?

23:20.550 --> 23:22.500
Two deaths or two burglaries?

23:24.360 --> 23:26.480
Who told you?

23:27.360 --> 23:29.359
You just did.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.380
Or at least you confirmed it.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.360
In fairness,
I never doubted my source.

23:37.360 --> 23:39.559
Very few people knew about this.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.650
Who was it, a disgruntled cop?

23:43.360 --> 23:46.940
I never believe a word
the police tell me.

23:54.360 --> 23:56.420
Did The Stump pay for that hangover?

23:57.040 --> 23:59.790
Why did you tell them the
old men were murdered?

24:00.160 --> 24:04.839
I thought you'd be out there
getting DNA off everybody.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.649
Finding him.
That's your pitch, isn't it?

24:07.650 --> 24:09.630
Anyone, anywhere.

24:12.700 --> 24:16.039
Sorry.
I'm a bit wrecked.

24:16.040 --> 24:17.909
If you keep drinking, you'll get fired.

24:17.910 --> 24:20.719
Fired?
Nobody else wants this job.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.800
You've seen them round here.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.789
In the summer, it's the heat.

24:25.790 --> 24:27.619
In the winter, it's the cold.

24:27.620 --> 24:30.010
All year round, it's the loneliness.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.319
This is England.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.979
We hate our old folk.

24:33.980 --> 24:35.869
We don't visit them.

24:35.870 --> 24:37.659
We don't listen to them.

24:37.660 --> 24:40.579
We cut their fuel allowances.

24:40.580 --> 24:44.319
We sell them broadband when
they don't even have a computer.

24:44.320 --> 24:47.149
And sometimes we break
into their house,

24:47.150 --> 24:48.889
thump them on the head,
steal their jewellery

24:48.890 --> 24:50.240
and shit in their beds.

24:54.360 --> 24:58.129
Alma, you knew both Ralph and Stanley

24:58.130 --> 24:59.489
and they borrowed books from here.

24:59.490 --> 25:02.119
Oh, yeah.
Maybe I killed them.

25:02.120 --> 25:03.939
I'm just trying to find your father.

25:03.940 --> 25:06.359
You don't think I tried
to find him?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.389
I thought you lot
would do better.

25:08.390 --> 25:10.390
It stood to reason,
he had a record.

25:11.060 --> 25:14.389
He never held down a job. God
knows where he came from.

25:14.390 --> 25:17.650
It seemed like he only turned
up to knock my mum about.

25:18.360 --> 25:21.019
You lot looked for him
when my mum died, but...

25:21.020 --> 25:22.749
.. he was well gone.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.900
And he left his shitty motorbike.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.410
And my mum sold that for
three bottles of Buckfast.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.690
I hate him.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.090
You're not your father.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.930
You care about people.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.440
But you drink too much.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.660
I get why.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.330
But I wish you wouldn't.

25:51.360 --> 25:53.079
I'm coming, Bernie.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.389
It's not you.
It's him.

25:54.390 --> 25:56.589
You left this on my desk.

25:56.590 --> 25:59.700
It's been playing "Living In The
Prayer" for the last ten minutes.

26:00.050 --> 26:01.669
That'll be my office.

26:01.670 --> 26:03.899
It says "school" nine times.

26:03.900 --> 26:05.200
Excuse me.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.749
<i>A picture paints a thousand words.</i>

26:10.750 --> 26:13.560
<i>Security cameras,
a little more.</i>

26:15.360 --> 26:18.619
Sneaking unsuitable boys and
alcohol into school grounds

26:18.620 --> 26:20.910
is not the Queen Anne's way.

26:21.360 --> 26:23.919
I have no choice
but to suspend Kelsey.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.519
She is refusing to cooperate
with our investigation.

26:26.520 --> 26:30.019
Investigation?
We didn't kill the unsuitable boys.

26:30.020 --> 26:31.320
Kelsey!

26:32.360 --> 26:34.910
I'm so sorry. I don't know
what's gotten into her.

27:01.360 --> 27:05.219
<i>I heard what happened. I
went to Queen Anne's myself.</i>

27:05.220 --> 27:06.660
<i>I sit on the school board.</i>

27:07.950 --> 27:09.879
Astrid's got form.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.669
Then why is Kelsey the
only one who's suspended?

27:12.670 --> 27:14.559
Astrid's parents are Van Dorans.

27:14.560 --> 27:18.309
So, any trouble gets buried
under the new swimming pool

27:18.310 --> 27:20.270
her parents just paid for.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.890
Kelsey wants to leave Queen Anne's.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.280
It's not for everyone.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.460
Should I let her?

27:29.060 --> 27:32.400
I'm not exactly qualified
to give that sort of advice.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.850
I would make a terrible mother.

27:37.360 --> 27:39.039
I'm not...

27:39.040 --> 27:41.960
I'm not sure I've got
that sort of love in me.

27:45.720 --> 27:49.700
Well, I was terrified of
Kelsey when Ruth died.

27:50.360 --> 27:54.460
I just thought Kelsey would
break apart at any moment.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.119
And Ruth was never like that, though.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.860
She would just get in there
and scoop her up.

28:04.400 --> 28:07.660
You said it was a couple
of years ago now, but...

28:09.360 --> 28:13.050
We'd been skiing, just
Ruth and I, and she fell.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.359
Hit her head.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.549
Had a headache, but seemed fine.

28:17.550 --> 28:19.530
Went to sleep that night and...

28:20.360 --> 28:21.960
.. never woke up.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.359
So, now I've got to learn how to...

28:25.360 --> 28:27.450
.. scoop up my daughter.

28:38.360 --> 28:39.689
<i>JonJo Ryan,</i>

28:39.690 --> 28:42.519
a petty thief,
who disappeared 15 years back.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.139
He's recently resurfaced.

28:44.140 --> 28:48.009
He's still using his old MO,
the classic loop and tug.

28:48.010 --> 28:51.059
He worked with Henry
Reeves back in the day,

28:51.060 --> 28:52.869
but he's now operating solo.

28:52.870 --> 28:55.389
And this time,
he has a possible two murders

28:55.390 --> 28:57.159
to add to his name.

28:57.160 --> 28:59.809
He's a loner. Private.
Aggressively so.

28:59.810 --> 29:01.419
But he's starting to take chances.

29:01.420 --> 29:03.689
This is what we think he looks like now.

29:03.690 --> 29:07.719
He's cruel. More calculated,
as opposed to opportunistic.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.569
He targets the isolated
and vulnerable.

29:09.570 --> 29:12.189
- Sounds familiar.
- Known victims are old men.

29:12.190 --> 29:14.149
Unresolved father issues,
maybe.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.709
- The trouble is...
- Excuse me.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.399
DC Yeardsley, thank you.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.370
Cobley, do you want to stop
sucking on your teeth?

29:19.940 --> 29:23.099
This is a very valuable profile.
DC Yeardsley, thank you for that.

29:23.100 --> 29:25.509
And I can't believe I'm
going to say this, but...

29:25.510 --> 29:28.219
.. we're not going to find
this guy behind a PowerPoint.

29:28.220 --> 29:30.579
We need boots on the ground,
we need to go door to door.

29:30.580 --> 29:33.689
Let's get his image out there,
let's get it in the public's faces.

29:33.690 --> 29:35.619
That way they're more likely
to work with our DNA swabs,

29:35.620 --> 29:37.779
maybe give us a lead that's actionable.

29:37.780 --> 29:40.619
- It sounds a lot like...
- Overtime, PC Cobley.

29:40.620 --> 29:42.180
You see,
I can say the word.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.580
Find him.

29:44.900 --> 29:46.790
Nobody disappears into thin air.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.339
<i>We've got officers taking DNA</i>

29:56.340 --> 29:59.359
in Wrangle, Freestone and Butterwick.

29:59.360 --> 30:03.109
And in South Boston, we're
distributing JonJo Ryan Photofits.

30:03.110 --> 30:05.560
There you go, that's
what I'm talking about.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.679
Hey... You haven't just been
sitting there all day, have you?

30:23.680 --> 30:25.359
Just because you're
suspended doesn't mean...

30:25.360 --> 30:27.719
I think that's exactly what it means.

30:27.720 --> 30:30.759
Suspended in time and space,
like the kale in your smoothie.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.579
Maybe I should talk to the school.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.319
- Grovel a little.
- Because it's the best school?

30:35.320 --> 30:38.450
And the best schools make
the best people, right?

30:40.360 --> 30:42.119
You know what,
grab your coat.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.970
There's somewhere I need to be
and you need some fresh air.

30:47.650 --> 30:50.369
- Bernie!
- This is a library!

30:50.370 --> 30:51.670
Bernie...

30:52.160 --> 30:55.339
Could you tell Alma that Bill
Hixon is here to see her?

30:55.340 --> 30:56.649
No.

30:56.650 --> 30:58.879
This is my daughter Kelsey.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.909
I need to update her on the investigation.

31:01.910 --> 31:04.359
She's having a duvet day.
She's sick.

31:04.360 --> 31:07.139
She's sick quite a lot with
her drinking, isn't she?

31:07.140 --> 31:08.440
Alma doesn't drink.

31:08.840 --> 31:11.099
- Not alcohol.
- Sure.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.059
Can I borrow this, please?

31:13.060 --> 31:15.289
You do not have a library card.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.400
And I hear there's quite a waiting
list for this particular title.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.710
Ralph Walsh borrowed this.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.520
Bernie was right. Alma's sick.

31:46.810 --> 31:50.400
All right, everyone.
Muriel, Sean and, er...

31:51.320 --> 31:52.629
Chewie.

31:52.630 --> 31:53.939
OK, listen up.

31:53.940 --> 31:55.529
What is it, sir?

31:55.530 --> 31:58.910
Dead men do not return library books.

32:43.460 --> 32:44.760
Henry.

32:46.140 --> 32:47.460
Are you OK?

32:49.660 --> 32:51.780
I need a drink.

32:52.460 --> 32:54.090
You do, don't you?

32:54.840 --> 32:57.790
- What's up?
- I've just come from Skirbeck.

32:58.460 --> 33:00.490
A nice old geezer.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.620
Tony Cobley.

33:03.640 --> 33:04.950
Heart gave out.

33:05.330 --> 33:06.899
I've taken the body down to the morgue,

33:06.900 --> 33:09.539
but the police haven't
been to his flat yet.

33:09.540 --> 33:12.700
They reckon they can't get there
for at least a couple of hours.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.350
Shit.
I'm sorry.

33:19.460 --> 33:21.460
JonJo's your dad.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.760
He didn't say.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.810
Do you want me to tell you
all that stuff about him?

33:30.420 --> 33:32.480
How we used to rob back in the day.

33:33.140 --> 33:34.980
All the tricks of the trade.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.980
- What was that all about?
- I don't know.

33:39.460 --> 33:40.760
I'm sorry.

33:44.310 --> 33:47.950
Never mind.
I'd rather drink alone.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.550
If JonJo is back...

33:52.980 --> 33:55.580
.. I wouldn't want to meet
him down some dark alley.

35:19.460 --> 35:20.760
Hello?

35:47.660 --> 35:49.410
You...

35:49.830 --> 35:51.660
Henry said you were...

35:56.660 --> 35:58.379
Alma, Alma...

35:58.380 --> 35:59.859
Stop.

35:59.860 --> 36:01.440
We know what you did.

36:02.020 --> 36:04.059
You left us a very good trail.

36:04.060 --> 36:06.059
This is your father's glove,
isn't it?

36:06.060 --> 36:08.219
The one you left for us at Ralph's.

36:08.220 --> 36:10.419
You knew we'd find his DNA on it.

36:10.420 --> 36:13.120
But at Nora's you used the
hair from the bike helmet.

36:13.460 --> 36:15.270
It's all I had of him.

36:18.160 --> 36:20.819
- Has she been drinking again?
- That's enough.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.360
She doesn't drink.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.180
She's sick.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.459
I'm dying, Bill.

36:28.460 --> 36:30.459
I know you are, sweetheart.

36:30.460 --> 36:32.280
I know you are.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.989
HH.

37:03.990 --> 37:06.609
The only other thing I got from my dad.

37:06.610 --> 37:09.080
HH blood,
one in a million.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.119
So, only you would be a
match for a transplant.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.859
Do you know how many HH livers

37:14.860 --> 37:16.750
have come up
on the transplant list?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.990
Not one, ever.

37:21.460 --> 37:22.760
I'm sorry.

37:25.060 --> 37:27.160
Bloody Pet Cemetery.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.179
I should have left it
on Ralph's bedside.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.980
But you know the waiting
list on that modern classic.

37:36.140 --> 37:39.850
Ralph didn't show up
at the library.

37:40.160 --> 37:41.839
He was never late
with his returns.

37:41.840 --> 37:44.070
You realised he could help you.

37:44.460 --> 37:46.980
Make it look like he'd
been murdered, robbed.

37:47.460 --> 37:49.609
You wanted us to help you
find your dad.

37:49.610 --> 37:50.910
Stupid.

37:52.140 --> 37:54.009
I didn't think that it would work.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.640
It was a good try...

37:56.460 --> 37:58.109
.. what you did.

37:58.110 --> 37:59.979
Talking to The Stump.

37:59.980 --> 38:01.770
Nora's house.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.110
You kept us interested.

38:05.460 --> 38:09.050
Don't think I didn't try
everything else to find my dad.

38:12.460 --> 38:13.760
He just...

38:15.140 --> 38:16.799
.. disappeared.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.770
He didn't want me.

38:20.350 --> 38:21.950
He didn't know you.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.960
The last time I saw him...

38:26.820 --> 38:28.860
.. it was the middle of the night.

38:29.460 --> 38:32.219
I woke up, he was sitting on my bed.

38:32.220 --> 38:33.839
He seemed upset.

38:33.840 --> 38:36.860
He told me the devil had got his soul.

38:42.460 --> 38:44.460
He's dead, isn't he?

38:46.460 --> 38:48.670
We're going to keep looking for him.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.560
But I think you're right.

38:58.460 --> 39:01.850
Poor Ralph was slumped over the
kitchen table when I found him.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.900
It's a terrible thing to be
on your own.

39:10.990 --> 39:12.290
It's terrible.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.399
The news is out.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.139
Some praise, for once.

39:29.140 --> 39:31.579
It won't last.
Not much does.

39:31.580 --> 39:35.059
Yeah, well, Yeardsley,
it's not personal.

39:35.060 --> 39:36.809
You're an above-average
detective.

39:36.810 --> 39:38.319
Miles above.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.659
You care. Not everybody does.

39:40.660 --> 39:44.159
Thanks. Well, I did an
above-average check on the server.

39:44.160 --> 39:46.689
- Guess what I found?
- That I leaked the cuts.

39:46.690 --> 39:49.399
It's the best and easiest way to
get the information out there.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.710
And you're fine.
You're young.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.709
Cobley isn't.

39:53.710 --> 39:57.550
The best thing he can hope
for is watchman in Iceland.

39:58.150 --> 39:59.609
It's a shop.

39:59.610 --> 40:01.970
And you don't know I'll be fine, neither.

40:05.260 --> 40:07.119
<i>The governors
met this morning</i>

40:07.120 --> 40:11.759
<i>and it has been determined that Kelsey
will serve a suspension of no less...</i>

40:11.760 --> 40:13.769
Suspensions run in our family.

40:13.770 --> 40:15.690
And quitting, too.

40:16.460 --> 40:18.899
What if we looked at this
in a different light?

40:18.900 --> 40:20.209
I'm a man of means.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.449
What if I said that I
would pay for a resurfacing

40:22.450 --> 40:23.759
of the sports court?

40:23.760 --> 40:26.410
- Or maybe building a new library?
- Well...

40:26.890 --> 40:28.859
Obviously, we'd have to
look at all aspects of...

40:28.860 --> 40:31.419
- Dad!
- I wasn't going to do it.

40:31.420 --> 40:34.250
I just wanted to see the look
on her face when I asked.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.920
God, we just outsource
everything, don't we?

40:39.460 --> 40:41.419
From our kids to our parents,

40:41.420 --> 40:44.379
who pay other people to do the
things we don't want to do.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.389
Teachers and nurses to wipe
their arses so we don't have to.

40:47.390 --> 40:49.449
It doesn't work.
Doesn't work
for them, doesn't work for us.

40:49.450 --> 40:50.919
It works for you.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.779
I mean, look at your
handbag. What does that cost?

40:53.780 --> 40:56.699
2,500 bucks? I was just
at a hospital with a girl.

40:56.700 --> 40:58.819
Five of those handbags would
have bought her a new liver.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.309
It would have saved her life.

41:00.310 --> 41:02.890
That, or a dad
who cared about her.

41:04.460 --> 41:07.550
I don't blame you. You're
just a brochure in human form.

41:08.460 --> 41:10.860
But you shouldn't pretend to care.

41:11.910 --> 41:14.260
And we shouldn't pretend to believe you.

41:16.160 --> 41:18.749
Sorry, Kels, I fucked up
another school for you.

41:18.750 --> 41:21.319
Sorry?
That was cool.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.949
Let's get out of here.

41:22.950 --> 41:25.090
Don't deceive yourself, Mr. Hixon.

41:25.460 --> 41:28.860
Your daughter was the prime
mover in this sordid event.

41:29.870 --> 41:32.129
Her accomplice, Miss Van
Doran, told us everything.

41:32.130 --> 41:35.589
That is the only reason Astrid
is being treated leniently.

41:35.590 --> 41:38.269
I'm sorry,
could you say that again?

41:38.270 --> 41:40.980
You let one of them off
for ratting out the other?

41:43.460 --> 41:45.459
You gave us Henry Reeves.

41:45.460 --> 41:48.360
But you knew it was his
accomplice all along, didn't you?

41:48.820 --> 41:52.459
JonJo Ryan,
he gave up Henry, didn't he?

41:52.460 --> 41:54.710
I'm willing to bet a few others.

41:55.500 --> 41:58.999
JonJo gave up half
the crims in South Boston.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.079
Out of the goodness of his heart?

42:01.080 --> 42:03.899
Maybe.
Maybe he found a conscience.

42:03.900 --> 42:07.159
Or maybe he knew a good
deal when he saw one.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.459
Immunity for information.

42:09.460 --> 42:11.450
Where is he?
We know you know.

42:12.060 --> 42:14.159
What's in it for me?

42:14.160 --> 42:16.210
You get to save a girl's life.

42:18.060 --> 42:20.419
No. A girl's life doesn't cut it for me.

42:20.420 --> 42:21.790
What else have you got?

42:23.650 --> 42:26.090
No!
Take a walk.
Take a walk, now.

42:28.460 --> 42:30.500
Go fuck yourself.

42:34.460 --> 42:36.499
What about you, hey, Muriel?

42:36.500 --> 42:39.760
What have you got that
might save a girl's life?

42:40.460 --> 42:43.430
Come on. It's just a bloody coffee cup.

42:50.060 --> 42:52.860
<i>How bad do you want JonJo Ryan?</i>

42:56.050 --> 42:59.260
I don't know what made that
bastard Blair change his mind.

43:00.950 --> 43:02.259
Does it matter?

43:02.260 --> 43:04.960
Maybe he found a
conscience, like JonJo did.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.819
Yeah, I'm not a woman, I'm a cop.

43:09.820 --> 43:12.060
Not in the eyes of God, Yeardsley.

43:12.160 --> 43:14.819
NO WOMEN PAST THIS POINT,
PLEASE

43:16.950 --> 43:20.520
Hi.
I called. I'm looking for a JonJo Ryan.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.760
Come in.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.830
JonJo Ryan's dead.

43:32.980 --> 43:36.299
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

43:36.300 --> 43:38.090
He was a nasty bastard.

43:38.820 --> 43:41.570
St Ignatius, the founder
of the Jesuit order,

43:42.580 --> 43:44.530
he'd been a nasty bastard, too.

43:45.140 --> 43:48.099
He believed we had to walk
in the shoes of Christ.

43:48.100 --> 43:50.459
Perinde ac cadaver.

43:50.460 --> 43:53.819
My Latin's a little rusty, but
that's something about a corpse.

43:53.820 --> 43:56.300
It's only when we give up on this life...

43:57.300 --> 43:59.420
.. can we be reborn in Jesus.

44:04.460 --> 44:06.390
You're JonJo Ryan.

44:08.980 --> 44:11.100
You were JonJo Ryan.

44:11.460 --> 44:13.650
Well, I've been looking for you.

44:14.980 --> 44:17.239
You want to talk about
the past. I don't.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.329
What about Alma?
Can we talk about her?

44:19.330 --> 44:22.850
- I was poison for her.
- Yeah. You were.

44:24.140 --> 44:27.460
But you have something that
only a father can give her now.
