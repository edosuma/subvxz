WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:04.330
Four evicted
HouseGuests competing

00:04.330 --> 00:07.210
in three epic battles
for a second shot

00:07.210 --> 00:08.970
at a half million dollars.

00:08.970 --> 00:12.850
And the HouseGuests
have no idea.

00:12.850 --> 00:16.710
Welcome to the "Big Brother"
Battle Back Showdown.

00:21.690 --> 00:25.370
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Big Brother"--

00:25.370 --> 00:27.240
Oh my god!

00:27.240 --> 00:29.140
ANNOUNCER: On the opening
night of the game--

00:29.140 --> 00:30.010
Season 19, baby.

00:30.010 --> 00:30.880
Season 19.

00:30.880 --> 00:34.690
ANNOUNCER: A temptation sends
a "Big Brother" vet back in.

00:34.690 --> 00:37.840
Sorry I'm late!

00:37.840 --> 00:41.570
Which one of you bit the
apple and got the snake, baby?

00:41.570 --> 00:43.060
Who was it?
Who was it?

00:43.060 --> 00:44.260
ANNOUNCER: But it
was a twist that

00:44.260 --> 00:46.090
had Paul taking someone's spot.

00:46.090 --> 00:47.980
JULIE CHEN: That's
right, HouseGuests.

00:47.980 --> 00:52.990
This is the first ever
"Big Brother" swap.

00:52.990 --> 00:56.080
One of you will be evicted
from the "Big Brother"

00:56.080 --> 00:57.970
house tonight.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.820
ANNOUNCER: And Cameron
was first sent packing.

01:00.820 --> 01:03.040
JULIE CHEN: Cameron,
you are evicted

01:03.040 --> 01:05.980
from the "Big Brother" house.

01:05.980 --> 01:07.750
ANNOUNCER: Even though
Jillian tried to align

01:07.750 --> 01:09.000
the outsiders of the house--

01:12.370 --> 01:15.160
ANNOUNCER: --her
timeshare soon expired.

01:15.160 --> 01:17.340
JULIE CHEN: Jillian,
you are evicted

01:17.340 --> 01:18.310
from the "Big Brother" house.

01:20.820 --> 01:22.530
ANNOUNCER: Early in the game--

01:22.530 --> 01:23.700
Dude, I'm excited, bro.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.890
ANNOUNCER: --Cody was
running the house.

01:25.890 --> 01:28.260
But after he unexpectedly
tried to take out

01:28.260 --> 01:30.630
his allies Paul and Christmas--

01:30.630 --> 01:31.950
Christmas, you got screwed.

01:31.950 --> 01:33.390
Take a seat.

01:33.390 --> 01:34.950
Cody, this is week one.

01:34.950 --> 01:37.200
Why are you trying to
make these maverick moves?

01:37.200 --> 01:39.990
ANNOUNCER: --the majority of
the house turned against him.

01:39.990 --> 01:41.730
I've got an A-plus
plan to get Cody out

01:41.730 --> 01:43.310
of this house
because Cody screwed

01:43.310 --> 01:46.050
over everybody in this house.

01:46.050 --> 01:47.970
ANNOUNCER: Before the
Marine skipped off,

01:47.970 --> 01:49.580
he threw some people
under the bus.

01:55.420 --> 01:57.950
Thick as thieves, off
to the side, all the time.

01:57.950 --> 02:00.080
ANNOUNCER: But it didn't
change Cody's fate.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.330
JULIE CHEN: Cody,
you have been evicted

02:02.330 --> 02:04.940
from the "Big Brother" house.

02:04.940 --> 02:08.530
ANNOUNCER: With Cody's showmance
Jessica alone in the game--

02:08.530 --> 02:12.740
If I stay in this game, I
want revenge for everyone that

02:12.740 --> 02:15.630
stabbed Cody and I in the back.

02:15.630 --> 02:19.070
ANNOUNCER: --Paul shifted the
target to Dominique instead.

02:19.070 --> 02:20.310
This is your choice.

02:20.310 --> 02:23.020
You draw that line in the
sand and take a serious shot.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.060
Dominique obviously showed
she's a good competitor.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.180
Dom is smart.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.280
I would rather target
Dom first before Mark

02:28.280 --> 02:29.840
because, honestly,
I think Dominique

02:29.840 --> 02:33.670
is more of a competitor and
more of a threat in this game.

02:33.670 --> 02:37.050
ANNOUNCER: And the nuclear
engineer's game was blown away.

02:37.050 --> 02:42.180
JULIE CHEN: By a vote
of 10 to 0, Dominique,

02:42.180 --> 02:44.980
you are evicted from
the "Big Brother" house.

02:44.980 --> 02:47.680
ANNOUNCER: Tonight, these
four evicted HouseGuests

02:47.680 --> 02:50.570
get a chance to battle
back into the game.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.860
But for the first time ever,
if they want to return,

02:53.860 --> 02:57.730
they must win an epic showdown
against someone in the house.

02:57.730 --> 03:01.980
All this right now
on "Big Brother."

03:01.980 --> 03:05.260
Don't call me
booboo, sweetheart.

03:49.370 --> 03:50.130
Good evening.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.210
I'm Julie Chen.

03:51.210 --> 03:54.770
Welcome to the "Big Brother"
Battle Back Showdown.

03:54.770 --> 03:57.590
Last summer, the first
four evicted HouseGuests

03:57.590 --> 03:59.780
competed in the Battle Back.

03:59.780 --> 04:02.450
But this summer,
returning to the game

04:02.450 --> 04:05.130
is going to be even
more challenging.

04:05.130 --> 04:09.560
That's because tonight there
is no guarantee that anyone

04:09.560 --> 04:11.720
will return to the house.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.210
It's now time to say
hello to the Battle

04:14.210 --> 04:18.180
Back Showdown competitors.

04:18.180 --> 04:20.590
Welcome back.

04:20.590 --> 04:23.080
Cameron.
- Woo.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.300
JULIE CHEN: Jillian.

04:29.250 --> 04:31.960
Woo-hoo!
JULIE CHEN: Cody.

04:36.210 --> 04:41.840
And evicted just last
night, Dominique.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.300
Let's do this.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.270
JULIE CHEN: Hello, everyone.

04:48.270 --> 04:50.100
Hi, Julie.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.680
JULIE CHEN: As you
know, you have a chance

04:52.680 --> 04:55.150
to get back into this game.

04:55.150 --> 04:56.700
Here's how the night
is going to work.

04:56.700 --> 05:00.240
Right now, you are
standing in Evictionville.

05:00.240 --> 05:04.920
And to escape, you'll need
to win three competitions.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.180
The four of you will
compete against each other

05:07.180 --> 05:09.260
in the first challenge
of the night.

05:09.260 --> 05:12.040
The top two finishers
will advance.

05:12.040 --> 05:15.650
The other two will
go home for good.

05:15.650 --> 05:18.120
The two winners will
then go head-to-head

05:18.120 --> 05:20.910
in the second
competition of the night.

05:20.910 --> 05:24.940
Win, and you are the final
evictee left standing.

05:24.940 --> 05:28.880
But you are not back in the
"Big Brother" game just yet.

05:28.880 --> 05:29.580
Oh my goodness.

05:29.580 --> 05:31.470
JULIE CHEN: In a
"Big Brother" first,

05:31.470 --> 05:35.370
this Battle Back will
end in a showdown,

05:35.370 --> 05:40.440
you against a challenger
from the house.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.840
The current HouseGuests will
vote to send one of their own

05:43.840 --> 05:48.240
to face off against the final
evictee in the most important

05:48.240 --> 05:50.580
challenge of the night.

05:50.580 --> 05:53.600
If the evictee beats
the house challenger,

05:53.600 --> 05:55.820
you're back in the game.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.050
But if the house
challenger wins,

05:58.050 --> 06:01.080
no one will be
returning to the game.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.480
You are all going home for good.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.780
Does everyone understand?

06:10.780 --> 06:12.420
- Yes, Julie.
- Yes.

06:12.420 --> 06:14.340
JULIE CHEN: Great.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.380
I have to win this Battle
Back for multiple reasons.

06:16.380 --> 06:18.450
I just want to kick in so
many doors in this house,

06:18.450 --> 06:20.570
and I want to wreck so
many people's games.

06:20.570 --> 06:22.500
Because there was a lot of
people that were disloyal to me

06:22.500 --> 06:24.100
in this house, and
I would love to get

06:24.100 --> 06:25.130
back in and blow up their game.

06:28.240 --> 06:31.060
I feel like I deserve a
second shot in this game.

06:31.060 --> 06:34.300
I was evicted from
the house wrongfully.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.620
So I'm ready to go back in.

06:36.620 --> 06:39.490
And I'm going after
Paul, the snake.

06:39.490 --> 06:42.310
JULIE CHEN: It's time for your
first battle of the night.

06:42.310 --> 06:46.450
This competition is called Maze
Race, and here's how it works.

06:46.450 --> 06:50.860
On my go, you must maneuver
your ball through the maze using

06:50.860 --> 06:54.700
a rope and pulley system to
get your ball to the finish

06:54.700 --> 06:57.210
at the other end of the maze.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.280
Sounds easy enough.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.340
But, if your ball
falls through a hole,

07:01.340 --> 07:05.620
you will need to collect
it and start over.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.450
I came to "Big Brother"
because I'm a super-fan

07:07.450 --> 07:08.160
of the show.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.290
I have unfinished business.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.920
I only spent 11
hours in this house.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.330
I need to win this Battle Back.

07:13.330 --> 07:14.590
I need to be back in this house.

07:14.590 --> 07:15.700
This is my dream.

07:15.700 --> 07:16.660
I'm ready physically.

07:16.660 --> 07:17.560
I'm ready mentally.

07:17.560 --> 07:19.480
I've been solving
my Rubik's cubes.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.390
I'm going to win it.

07:20.390 --> 07:23.240
This Battle Back is mine.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.750
I have to win this
Battle Back because this

07:25.750 --> 07:29.200
is my only chance to
get back in the house

07:29.200 --> 07:31.450
and compete for the $500,000.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.430
I don't care if I gotta
fight all night long.

07:33.430 --> 07:36.390
I'm going back in.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.550
JULIE CHEN: The first two
people to successfully

07:38.550 --> 07:42.970
finish the maze will move on
to the second competition.

07:42.970 --> 07:46.930
The other two will be
officially eliminated.

07:46.930 --> 07:48.740
Does everyone understand?
- Yep.

07:48.740 --> 07:49.550
Yes.

07:49.550 --> 07:50.250
JULIE CHEN: Good.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.940
Remember, the top two
finishers advance.

07:52.940 --> 07:56.780
The bottom two go home.

07:56.780 --> 08:00.370
This competition starts now.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.450
This game requires finesse.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.740
And I don't feel like I have the
finesse required for this game.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.380
You pull the rope up,
and it, like, raises it,

08:18.380 --> 08:20.500
but it sends the ball
the opposite direction.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.700
And it's odd to try
and feel out this rope

08:22.700 --> 08:24.380
system and pulley system.

08:24.380 --> 08:26.710
I'm just kind of worried if
anybody else gets a hang of it

08:26.710 --> 08:27.410
before I do.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.340
- No.

08:34.340 --> 08:35.410
Do not go.

08:38.660 --> 08:41.570
I gotta move fast,
but not too fast.

08:41.570 --> 08:43.610
Because I don't want
my ball to drop.

08:43.610 --> 08:44.870
I don't want to
start all over again.

08:56.190 --> 08:58.580
This competition is
actually really hard--

08:58.580 --> 09:02.240
to get this board
that's tilted, balanced,

09:02.240 --> 09:05.190
and there's other
holes in the maze.

09:05.190 --> 09:08.180
So as soon as you get the ball
going the way you want it to,

09:08.180 --> 09:10.510
it's going too fast.

09:12.410 --> 09:15.950
JULIE CHEN: Jillian
has to start over.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.860
The bad news never ends.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.590
I have to start all over again.

09:20.590 --> 09:23.990
At this point, I'm thinking
I have a 50/50 chance.

09:23.990 --> 09:26.760
I just hope that somebody's
ball drops right after mine.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.570
There's a learning
curve involved.

09:40.570 --> 09:42.220
The controls are
kind of inverse.

09:42.220 --> 09:44.470
I'm having a little bit of a
problem trying to get the ball

09:44.470 --> 09:45.790
exactly where I want to go.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.260
JULIE CHEN: Cameron
has to start over.

10:03.260 --> 10:04.460
I feel devastated.

10:04.460 --> 10:05.690
I have to start all over again.

10:05.690 --> 10:06.770
Everybody's ahead of me.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.870
I have to be more
careful from now on.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.120
I am focused.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.600
I'm being pretty
cautious about moving

10:21.600 --> 10:22.920
this ball through the maze.

10:22.920 --> 10:25.050
But then I hear
Jillian's ball drop,

10:25.050 --> 10:26.890
and then I hear
Cameron's ball drop.

10:26.890 --> 10:29.760
Now, I mean, all I have to do at
this point is just be patient.

10:58.350 --> 11:02.060
JULIE CHEN: Jillian has
to start over once again.

11:02.060 --> 11:05.000
I can't figure out
the rhythm of the board.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.640
Why am I the Bad News
Bear all the time?

11:23.470 --> 11:26.030
There's a few more holes
towards the end of the maze.

11:26.030 --> 11:29.080
I am just being as slow
and steady as possible,

11:29.080 --> 11:32.260
so that way I don't drop my
ball, like right at the end.

11:41.070 --> 11:42.540
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cody.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.160
You are moving on.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.790
But there is still one
more spot to be claimed.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.070
I'm not too excited yet,
because there's two more parts

11:50.070 --> 11:52.050
of this competition that
I have to win to even

11:52.050 --> 11:53.250
make it back in the house.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.690
First step down, two
more rounds to go.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.580
One step closer to seeing Jess.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.770
Seems like Jillian is
on a different planet.

12:03.770 --> 12:05.510
She's nowhere near done.

12:05.510 --> 12:08.120
Dominique is saying
things to Jesus.

12:08.120 --> 12:09.460
OK, Jesus.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.130
And Cody is done.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.740
My fate is in my own hands.

12:13.740 --> 12:15.060
I'm going to do
whatever it takes.

12:15.060 --> 12:20.030
I'm just going to focus and
not take my eye off the prize.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.490
JULIE CHEN: It is now
down between Cameron,

12:22.490 --> 12:25.190
Jillian, and Dominique.

12:25.190 --> 12:28.340
Only one of you
three may move on.

12:31.880 --> 12:33.440
I have to take home the win.

12:33.440 --> 12:36.720
I gotta get back in the house,
because I'm taking down Paul.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.700
At this point, I'm just
praying that one of them

12:42.700 --> 12:45.460
drops the ball and
has to start over.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.980
I gotta pull this
out because otherwise

12:47.980 --> 12:51.880
I'm go back to Las Vegas.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.460
This is my dream
to be in this house.

12:53.460 --> 12:54.480
I need to focus.

12:54.480 --> 12:57.030
I need to win this competition,
so that way I can go

12:57.030 --> 13:00.390
against Cody in the next round.

13:00.390 --> 13:02.260
My ball is getting close
to the finish line,

13:02.260 --> 13:04.080
so I decide to
take it really slow

13:04.080 --> 13:06.940
and make sure I don't hit any
of the last manhole covers.

13:11.520 --> 13:12.660
My ball is in sight.

13:12.660 --> 13:14.220
It's so close.

13:14.220 --> 13:16.170
I just can't screw it up here.

13:16.170 --> 13:18.430
All I need to do is just
march it down the line.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.830
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cameron.

13:32.830 --> 13:33.530
Yes!

13:33.530 --> 13:38.710
JULIE CHEN: You and Cody
both advance to round two.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.970
Woo!
I finished in the top two.

13:40.970 --> 13:42.460
I'm going on to the next round.

13:42.460 --> 13:43.810
This is amazing.

13:43.810 --> 13:44.560
Yes!

13:44.560 --> 13:46.340
I'm going to win
whatever competition

13:46.340 --> 13:48.620
it takes to get
back in that house.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.580
There's nothing that's
going to stop me.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.570
JULIE CHEN: Jillian, Dominique,
I'm sorry, but you two ladies

13:55.570 --> 13:58.700
are officially going home.

13:58.700 --> 13:59.580
Congratulations.

13:59.580 --> 14:00.290
Thank you.

14:00.290 --> 14:01.120
You're welcome.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.370
I'm disappointed in
myself because this

14:03.370 --> 14:05.350
was a second chance.

14:05.350 --> 14:08.350
I wanted to get back
in that house to take

14:08.350 --> 14:10.800
down Paul and his minions.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.030
I guess I can't do that now.

14:13.030 --> 14:14.230
- Kick ass.
- Congratulations.

14:14.230 --> 14:15.130
My
- Thank you.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.880
- Congratulations, guys.
- Woo!

14:16.880 --> 14:20.050
Cody, I'm happy for him,
and he's a good competitor.

14:20.050 --> 14:23.620
Cameron, I'm like, we tried to
get rid of you the first time,

14:23.620 --> 14:25.570
and now you took my spot.

14:25.570 --> 14:30.520
So, good for you,
but good for you.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.510
Dude, you killed it.

14:31.510 --> 14:34.450
You went so fast there.

14:34.450 --> 14:36.250
I'm advancing, which is great.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.440
But I gotta win two more
to get back in the house.

14:38.440 --> 14:39.730
I gotta beat Cameron.

14:39.730 --> 14:41.980
I can't say I lost
every competition.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.720
I came in second in one.

14:43.720 --> 14:47.020
Up next, Cody and
Cameron go head to head.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.500
The winner advances and will
face the house challenger.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.840
The loser goes home.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.870
Stay with us.

15:08.820 --> 15:12.840
Welcome back to the "Big
Brother" Battle Back showdown.

15:12.840 --> 15:15.120
Already tonight Cody
and Cameron were

15:15.120 --> 15:18.270
victorious in the first
battle of the night.

15:18.270 --> 15:20.490
Now they'll face
off for the chance

15:20.490 --> 15:23.910
to move on to the final
battle where the winner

15:23.910 --> 15:26.520
will face the house challenger.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.880
Let's head to the
backyard and begin.

15:29.880 --> 15:35.700
Cody, Cameron, it's now time for
the second battle of the night.

15:35.700 --> 15:39.690
The winner will advance and
take on the house challenger

15:39.690 --> 15:43.080
for the chance to get
back into the game.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.860
This competition is
called Billboard Bashers,

15:46.860 --> 15:48.380
and here's how it works.

15:48.380 --> 15:52.320
On my go, you will use
your launcher to catapult

15:52.320 --> 15:54.870
balls at your billboard.

15:54.870 --> 15:58.560
Each billboard has 10
tunnels that are closed.

15:58.560 --> 16:01.880
The first player to knock
out all 10 of their panels

16:01.880 --> 16:06.030
will advance to the final
competition of the night.

16:06.030 --> 16:08.790
If you run out of balls,
you must retrieve them

16:08.790 --> 16:11.180
in order to continue playing.

16:11.180 --> 16:12.570
Do you both understand?

16:12.570 --> 16:13.740
Yep.

16:13.740 --> 16:14.640
JULIE CHEN: All right.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.950
Great.

16:15.950 --> 16:19.590
This competition starts now.

16:35.880 --> 16:37.340
I just made it
through the first round.

16:37.340 --> 16:38.440
I'm onto the second.

16:38.440 --> 16:39.880
I got the momentum.

16:39.880 --> 16:40.900
I'm excited.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.220
Cody doesn't have anything.

16:42.220 --> 16:44.410
He's like a stone-faced monster.

16:44.410 --> 16:45.830
I think I got this in the bag.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.630
JULIE CHEN: Cameron
gets one panel down.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.850
Cody with one panel down.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.620
Before I get
back in this house,

17:02.620 --> 17:04.450
I just know that I
have to be Cameron.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.940
I'm not sure how well
I'll do right off the bat,

17:06.940 --> 17:09.720
but I have to maintain my focus
and knock down these panels.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.560
JULIE CHEN: Cameron,
two panels down.

17:25.990 --> 17:27.460
The hardest part
of this competition

17:27.460 --> 17:29.780
is really just
shooting the balls.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.900
There's a steep learning
curve, so my strategy

17:31.900 --> 17:34.420
is to figure out how the
slingshot works, because if I

17:34.420 --> 17:36.010
can figure out
the mechanism then

17:36.010 --> 17:38.020
I could be more
accurate with my shots.

17:45.220 --> 17:47.180
JULIE CHEN: Cody
with two panels down,

17:47.180 --> 17:50.810
Cameron with three panels down.

17:50.810 --> 17:52.010
I'm a little
surprised Cameron's

17:52.010 --> 17:53.090
beating me at this point.

17:53.090 --> 17:54.980
I figured my accuracy
would be better.

17:58.720 --> 18:01.860
JULIE CHEN: Cameron
with four panels down.

18:01.860 --> 18:03.700
I'm the Marine,
but I'm starting

18:03.700 --> 18:06.430
to realize that shooting
a gun and using a balloon

18:06.430 --> 18:08.650
launcher to shoot some
balls at a billboard

18:08.650 --> 18:10.600
are two different things.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.500
JULIE CHEN: Cody with
three paddles down,

18:15.500 --> 18:16.340
Cameron with four.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.740
Cameron with five panels down.

18:26.740 --> 18:29.330
So in the middle of me trying
to figure out this mechanism,

18:29.330 --> 18:30.530
I'm just hitting targets.

18:30.530 --> 18:32.300
I'm surprising myself here.

18:35.460 --> 18:38.840
JULIE CHEN: Cameron
with six panels down.

18:38.840 --> 18:40.280
I take the early lead.

18:40.280 --> 18:41.360
This is exciting.

18:41.360 --> 18:42.800
It's just going to
build from here.

18:48.050 --> 18:49.280
There's no giving
up at this point.

18:49.280 --> 18:50.870
Like, now I'm in a
clutch situation.

18:50.870 --> 18:52.220
My strategy is not working.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.510
I've got to change it up.

18:53.510 --> 18:57.970
And all I do is soften
up my launch technique.

19:00.950 --> 19:03.320
JULIE CHEN: Cody,
four panels down.

19:03.320 --> 19:04.640
And Cameron has seven down.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.550
Cody has five panels down.

19:12.550 --> 19:14.740
I realize now, I
have to lob these balls

19:14.740 --> 19:18.970
softer at the target, and it
actually improves my accuracy.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.530
JULIE CHEN: Six
panels down for Cody.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.810
Once I start
doing the soft lob,

19:28.810 --> 19:30.700
I mean, these panels
are starting to go down,

19:30.700 --> 19:33.890
and I'm doing a lot better.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.980
JULIE CHEN: The score
is 7-6, Cameron.

19:44.060 --> 19:46.600
This game is tied
right now, seven

19:46.600 --> 19:48.660
panels apiece for each of you.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.420
So, as you knock more
and more panels down,

20:05.420 --> 20:08.240
it gets harder because your
aim has to be more accurate.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.100
All my panels are
all spread out.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.600
I'm just pepping myself up.

20:11.600 --> 20:14.380
I really just need to focus
and then hit these targets.

20:17.190 --> 20:21.690
JULIE CHEN: Eight panels down
for Cody, takes the lead.

20:21.690 --> 20:23.760
I take the lead
ahead of Cameron.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.530
I just gotta knock down
these last few panels.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.920
So, Cody takes the lead.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.720
I know I need to go
grab some more balls

20:31.720 --> 20:32.610
and make some more shots.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.800
JULIE CHEN: Cody has eight
panels down, Cameron has seven.

20:53.510 --> 20:55.710
Cody has nine panels down.

20:55.710 --> 20:59.580
Cameron, seven panels down.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.800
Cody's in the lead, but
this is anybody's game.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.670
All you gotta do is
knock down those panels.

21:03.670 --> 21:06.450
I'm in it.
It's do or die, mano y mano.

21:06.450 --> 21:07.530
Cody, I'm coming for you.

21:10.070 --> 21:11.980
JULIE CHEN: Cody is
one away from victory.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.800
Congratulations, Cody.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.820
You are advancing to the
final battle of the night.

21:20.820 --> 21:23.640
Made it through round
two, got to knock out

21:23.640 --> 21:26.910
Cameron, who enjoyed two
more hours in the house.

21:26.910 --> 21:30.150
I'm just happy I'm going
on to the next round.

21:30.150 --> 21:32.640
JULIE CHEN: Cameron,
I'm sorry, but you

21:32.640 --> 21:36.840
are officially going home.

21:36.840 --> 21:38.130
Cody won.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.330
I'm immediately depressed.

21:39.330 --> 21:42.240
This was my only chance
to get back in the house.

21:42.240 --> 21:47.150
JULIE CHEN: Please say goodbye
to Cody, and exit the yard.

21:47.150 --> 21:50.490
You're a beast, man.

21:50.490 --> 21:53.260
My "Big Brother"
summer is over.

21:53.260 --> 21:55.350
This was my dream, to be here.

21:55.350 --> 21:59.310
I tried my best, and sometimes
your best isn't good enough.

22:06.580 --> 22:07.320
I am happy.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.700
I am satisfied.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.400
Because now I am
going to compete

22:10.400 --> 22:11.630
against somebody in the house.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.000
Two comps down, one more left.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.350
I gotta maintain my focus.

22:15.350 --> 22:17.330
I gotta win this thing
and get back in the house.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.870
JULIE CHEN: OK, Cody.

22:21.870 --> 22:25.740
You will soon battle
against the house challenger

22:25.740 --> 22:28.890
for your shot to get
back into the game.

22:28.890 --> 22:32.430
And since the HouseGuests
will pick their challenger,

22:32.430 --> 22:35.310
you now get to pick
either Maze Race

22:35.310 --> 22:40.500
or Billboard Bashers to battle
the house challenger in.

22:40.500 --> 22:42.330
But there's more.

22:42.330 --> 22:45.060
Both games will be
a little different.

22:45.060 --> 22:48.980
Maze Race will
contain a new maze.

22:48.980 --> 22:54.240
And in Billboard Bashers, the
billboards will be spinning.

22:54.240 --> 22:57.250
Which will it be?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.660
Maze Race.

22:58.660 --> 22:59.740
JULIE CHEN: All right.

22:59.740 --> 23:03.760
I'll be back shortly
to get things started.

23:03.760 --> 23:06.970
Up next, it's time to let the
HouseGuests in on tonight's

23:06.970 --> 23:08.710
Battle Back Showdown.

23:08.710 --> 23:12.190
How will they react when
they learn that Cody just

23:12.190 --> 23:14.220
might get back into the game?

23:14.220 --> 23:17.260
And who will they vote
to send into battle

23:17.260 --> 23:19.640
as the house challenger?
Stay with us.

23:36.210 --> 23:39.530
Welcome back to the "Big
Brother" Battle Back Showdown.

23:39.530 --> 23:43.100
Cody has defeated Dominique,
Jillian, and Cameron,

23:43.100 --> 23:45.830
and is now the
last man standing.

23:45.830 --> 23:49.940
He is just one competition
away from re-entering the game.

23:49.940 --> 23:53.760
And the HouseGuests
have no idea.

23:53.760 --> 23:55.580
It's time to let
them in on tonight's

23:55.580 --> 23:59.870
secret Battle Back Showdown.

23:59.870 --> 24:00.790
HouseGuests.

24:00.790 --> 24:02.330
Oh my gosh.

24:02.330 --> 24:04.630
JULIE CHEN: I need everyone
to gather in the living room

24:04.630 --> 24:06.280
right now.
- It's lit.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.020
It's not lit!

24:09.020 --> 24:10.700
Hi, Julie Chen.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.120
Wow.

24:12.120 --> 24:13.600
Seat check.

24:13.600 --> 24:14.710
JULIE CHEN: Thank you.

24:14.710 --> 24:17.680
All right, you're
all here, correct?

24:17.680 --> 24:18.400
Yes!

24:18.400 --> 24:22.600
Now, I'm sure you're
wondering why I'm here.

24:22.600 --> 24:23.440
Yeah.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.920
- A little bit.
- Yes.

24:24.920 --> 24:28.770
JULIE CHEN: Well, I'd like to
welcome you all to the "Big

24:28.770 --> 24:31.970
Brother" Battle Back Showdown.

24:31.970 --> 24:32.880
Oh my god.

24:36.520 --> 24:38.410
JULIE CHEN: Now,
you may have sent

24:38.410 --> 24:40.990
the first four HouseGuests
out the front door,

24:40.990 --> 24:44.650
but they did not go home.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.230
I knew it.

24:47.230 --> 24:49.600
JULIE CHEN: In fact,
they have been battling

24:49.600 --> 24:51.610
in the backyard
tonight for the chance

24:51.610 --> 24:53.890
to get back into the game.

24:53.890 --> 24:58.180
One of them has already
earned that opportunity.

24:58.180 --> 24:59.940
Oh my god.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.930
We were working so hard
to get Dominique out.

25:01.930 --> 25:03.880
What happens if she
walks through that door?

25:03.880 --> 25:05.530
The other possibility
that I'm not so fond about

25:05.530 --> 25:07.360
is, what if Cody comes back?

25:07.360 --> 25:09.400
On one hand, yeah, we were
friends and we're bros.

25:09.400 --> 25:10.810
But on the other
hand, that can really

25:10.810 --> 25:13.990
hinder me and Paul's plans.

25:13.990 --> 25:15.510
As soon as I hear
there's a Battle Back

25:15.510 --> 25:19.200
and somebody is coming back
in the house, I'm pissed off.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.990
I was a big part of two of
these people leaving the house.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.990
Now I have to deal
with somebody coming

25:24.990 --> 25:26.790
back who I turned my back on.

25:26.790 --> 25:29.190
I'm not happy.

25:29.190 --> 25:32.130
Best case scenario
on a friendship level

25:32.130 --> 25:35.100
would be Dominique or
Jillian to come back.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.720
I had a good
friendship with them,

25:36.720 --> 25:39.630
and, you know, I don't mind
having them back in the house.

25:39.630 --> 25:41.690
Worst case scenario
would be Cody.

25:41.690 --> 25:44.400
Me and Cody left
off on bad terms.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.070
I don't think that me and
Cody could ever be friends,

25:47.070 --> 25:49.230
at least in this house.

25:49.230 --> 25:55.180
JULIE CHEN: So, is it Cameron,
Jillian, Cody, or Dominique?

25:55.180 --> 25:57.360
Oh, my god.

25:57.360 --> 26:00.040
JULIE CHEN: You'll
find out in due time.

26:00.040 --> 26:03.050
See you soon, HouseGuests.

26:04.540 --> 26:09.180
I've been praying for this
moment since before Cody left.

26:09.180 --> 26:10.560
I really want to vomit.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.180
I really want it to be Cody.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.590
If Cody's back in the game,
it's going to change everything.

26:14.590 --> 26:15.290
It's amazing.

26:18.760 --> 26:19.900
Are you OK?

26:19.900 --> 26:22.510
No, I'm pissed.

26:22.510 --> 26:23.790
Why?

26:23.790 --> 26:27.810
Because if Cody walks
through those doors--

26:27.810 --> 26:29.240
- You're fine.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.750
Mark, look at me.

26:34.750 --> 26:35.450
You're fine.

26:38.450 --> 26:40.160
You've been good to me.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.480
Like--

26:43.360 --> 26:44.060
It does matter.

26:47.260 --> 26:48.190
Just--

26:52.340 --> 26:55.590
At this point,
anybody coming back is--

26:55.590 --> 26:59.190
not chill.
- No, not chill.

26:59.190 --> 27:00.880
Whatever.

27:00.880 --> 27:01.900
"Big Brother."

27:01.900 --> 27:03.190
I'm not excited.

27:03.190 --> 27:05.380
I did all the work to
get all these people out.

27:05.380 --> 27:07.640
Dominique pretty much
left on a sour note.

27:07.640 --> 27:10.370
And Cody, I know he's
a competitive type.

27:10.370 --> 27:11.890
So if he comes
back in this house,

27:11.890 --> 27:15.550
I know I'm going to have to
do all this work over again.

27:15.550 --> 27:17.430
Pissed.

27:17.430 --> 27:19.040
Well, you're excited
now, aren't you?

27:19.040 --> 27:20.770
No.
I'm very like--

27:20.770 --> 27:22.820
I'm not-- I have no idea who's
coming back through that door.

27:22.820 --> 27:24.150
Obviously you have no idea.

27:24.150 --> 27:24.980
None of us have any idea.

27:24.980 --> 27:26.080
I'm really not
getting excited.

27:26.080 --> 27:26.920
Damn, girl.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.010
Your energy just went
through the roof.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.900
When we return, we'll let the
HouseGuests know that they have

27:34.900 --> 27:37.120
the power to send
one of their own

27:37.120 --> 27:41.950
into battle against Cody to
stop his return to the game.

27:41.950 --> 27:43.580
Stay with us.

27:58.080 --> 28:01.130
Welcome back to the "Big
Brother" Battle Back Showdown.

28:01.130 --> 28:03.950
It's time to let the
HouseGuests know the big twist

28:03.950 --> 28:07.120
to this summer's Battle Back.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.050
HouseGuests.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.550
Please had to the
living room right now.

28:11.550 --> 28:13.720
Hi, Julie.
I missed you.

28:13.720 --> 28:14.630
What's up, Julie?

28:17.360 --> 28:21.470
As I told you, one of the
first four evicted HouseGuests

28:21.470 --> 28:26.930
has beaten out the others and is
prepared to return to the game.

28:26.930 --> 28:28.350
But you know our motto.

28:28.350 --> 28:29.390
Expect the unexpected.

28:29.390 --> 28:31.700
Expect the unexpected.

28:31.700 --> 28:34.140
So this Battle Back
comes with a twist.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.350
Of course.

28:36.350 --> 28:39.890
JULIE CHEN: For the first
time in "Big Brother" history,

28:39.890 --> 28:42.800
you as a house will
have the chance

28:42.800 --> 28:48.430
to stop this evicted HouseGuest
dead in his or her tracks--

28:48.430 --> 28:49.130
Nice.

28:49.130 --> 28:51.830
JULIE CHEN: --preventing them
from returning to the game.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.300
Nice.

28:53.300 --> 28:57.680
In just moments, you will
each head to the Diary Room

28:57.680 --> 29:01.970
and vote for the one
person you want to elect

29:01.970 --> 29:04.730
as your house challenger.

29:04.730 --> 29:07.460
This house challenger
will face off

29:07.460 --> 29:12.560
against the evicted HouseGuest
in the Battle Back Showdown.

29:12.560 --> 29:14.180
Wow.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.650
This is big.

29:15.650 --> 29:18.680
So, the mission is simple.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.940
Pick someone who you think will
beat the evicted HouseGuest.

29:22.940 --> 29:27.290
And if you're right, no
one returns to the game.

29:27.290 --> 29:31.050
Or if you want
someone to return,

29:31.050 --> 29:33.650
pick your weakest HouseGuest.

29:33.650 --> 29:36.920
Either way, you won't
know which evicted

29:36.920 --> 29:39.110
HouseGuest the house
challenger will be

29:39.110 --> 29:44.160
battling until after the vote.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.500
- I'm waiting for more!
- Come on, Julie.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.430
You're breaking my heart!

29:52.430 --> 29:54.680
JULIE CHEN: One at
a time, each of you

29:54.680 --> 29:57.440
will now enter the
Diary Room and cast

29:57.440 --> 30:02.820
a vote for who you want to
be the house challenger.

30:02.820 --> 30:08.190
And you cannot
vote for yourself.

30:08.190 --> 30:09.900
Alex, you're up first.

30:09.900 --> 30:12.250
Please go to the Diary Room.

30:12.250 --> 30:13.810
Got you, Alex.

30:13.810 --> 30:14.760
Vote for you.

30:22.370 --> 30:23.980
- Hello, Alex.
- Hello, Julie.

30:23.980 --> 30:26.990
Please cast your vote
for house challenger.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.120
- I vote for Paul.
- Thank you.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.950
Thank you.

30:30.950 --> 30:32.730
I vote for Alex.

30:32.730 --> 30:33.500
Oh, man.

30:33.500 --> 30:39.200
I faithfully vote to have
Paul as the house challenger.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.750
I vote for Paul to be
the house challenger.

30:41.750 --> 30:44.390
I'm going to have to
vote for Paul to do it.

30:44.390 --> 30:47.740
I want it to be vet against
vet, so I vote for Paul.

30:47.740 --> 30:48.840
Paul.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.080
I vote for Paul.

30:51.080 --> 30:52.100
Paul.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.210
I would like to vote for
Paul for house challenger.

30:54.210 --> 30:57.410
My house challenger
choice is Paul.

30:57.410 --> 30:58.910
I pick Paul.

31:02.410 --> 31:04.240
All of the votes are in.

31:04.240 --> 31:07.490
Let's return to the living room.

31:07.490 --> 31:11.200
HouseGuests, the votes are in.

31:11.200 --> 31:15.100
It's time to find out who
was voted house challenger

31:15.100 --> 31:17.260
and which evicted
HouseGuest they

31:17.260 --> 31:20.950
will be facing in the
final battle of the night.

31:20.950 --> 31:23.680
Head on out to the
backyard, everyone.

31:23.680 --> 31:25.870
Oh, yeah!

31:30.990 --> 31:32.360
Oh, my god!

31:32.360 --> 31:33.920
Oh, man!

31:33.920 --> 31:37.040
This is really friggin' cool.

31:37.040 --> 31:37.910
Battle Back Showdown!

31:41.230 --> 31:44.400
He'll pop out of there.

31:44.400 --> 31:48.090
OK, HouseGuests, it's
now time to reveal which

31:48.090 --> 31:50.400
evicted HouseGuest
will be fighting

31:50.400 --> 31:53.340
for their "Big Brother" life.

32:01.050 --> 32:03.240
Out of smoke comes Cody.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.640
And this is like a
fairytale for me.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.100
I couldn't have written
it better if I tried.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.620
All Cody has to do is
beat the house challenger,

32:10.620 --> 32:14.280
and I have my boyfriend
back in the house.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.540
There was a time
and a place where

32:15.540 --> 32:17.370
I wanted Cody to come
back, and it's because I

32:17.370 --> 32:19.070
thought I needed him to win.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.270
But at this point, I
don't need him to win.

32:21.270 --> 32:22.880
I have myself, I
have my alliances,

32:22.880 --> 32:25.200
and I think I got
this in the bag.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.670
I see Cody come
through the smoke,

32:26.670 --> 32:29.530
and it's bittersweet, because
I like him on a personal level.

32:29.530 --> 32:30.810
But on a game
level, this guy just

32:30.810 --> 32:33.230
threw my name under the bus
across the entire house.

32:33.230 --> 32:36.990
So I'm not looking
forward to this at all.

32:36.990 --> 32:41.610
As you can all see, Cody beat
out the other evictees to get

32:41.610 --> 32:44.160
his shot to re-enter the game.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.190
It's now time to reveal
which HouseGuest was voted

32:47.190 --> 32:51.270
to be the house challenger.

32:51.270 --> 32:57.080
With 11 votes, Paul, you
are the house challenger who

32:57.080 --> 32:59.870
will now face off against Cody.

32:59.870 --> 33:02.900
I'm extremely happy that the
house could agree on something

33:02.900 --> 33:04.490
and vote Paul as the
house challenger,

33:04.490 --> 33:06.920
because if anybody can take
this guy back out the game,

33:06.920 --> 33:09.890
it's going to be Paul.

33:09.890 --> 33:12.340
I voted for Paul because,
one, he's played "Big Brother"

33:12.340 --> 33:13.040
before.

33:13.040 --> 33:14.530
Two, he knows
these Battle Backs.

33:14.530 --> 33:17.310
And three, he knows challenges.
Come on, Paul.

33:17.310 --> 33:18.670
You've got to win
this and keep Cody

33:18.670 --> 33:20.180
from coming back in the house.

33:20.180 --> 33:24.690
JULIE CHEN: If you win, Paul,
then Cody is out of the game.

33:24.690 --> 33:27.320
If you lose, he returns.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.990
Surprise, surprise!

33:28.990 --> 33:31.120
I gotta battle
against Cody again.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.770
Yay!

33:32.770 --> 33:34.720
Cody, I got you
out of this house,

33:34.720 --> 33:37.790
and I'm sure as hell not
going to let you come back in.

33:37.790 --> 33:40.040
Let's do it.

33:40.040 --> 33:41.990
I am not shocked at
all that it's Paul.

33:41.990 --> 33:43.760
I knew it from the start
that they were going to pick

33:43.760 --> 33:45.230
Paul to play against me.

33:45.230 --> 33:47.540
He's a great
competitor, and it's

33:47.540 --> 33:51.550
the house's best chance of
not getting me back in there.

33:51.550 --> 33:54.800
Now, since the house
chose their challenger,

33:54.800 --> 33:57.830
Cody got to choose which
competition the two of you

33:57.830 --> 33:59.150
will battle in.

33:59.150 --> 34:02.390
And Cody chose Maze Race.

34:02.390 --> 34:05.240
But this competition will
be a different version

34:05.240 --> 34:07.910
than the one he played earlier.

34:07.910 --> 34:12.650
I'll be back shortly to begin
the Battle Back Showdown.

34:12.650 --> 34:16.550
When we return, Cody takes
on Paul for a second shot

34:16.550 --> 34:18.170
at a half million dollars.

34:18.170 --> 34:19.710
Stay with us.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.970
Welcome back to the "Big
Brother" Battle Back Showdown.

34:34.970 --> 34:37.160
It's now time to
see if Cody has what

34:37.160 --> 34:40.030
it takes to defeat Paul
for the opportunity

34:40.030 --> 34:41.720
to re-enter the game.

34:41.720 --> 34:43.940
Let's head to the backyard
and get the Battle

34:43.940 --> 34:46.920
Back Showdown started.

34:46.920 --> 34:50.500
HouseGuests, it's now time
for the final competition

34:50.500 --> 34:51.640
of the night.

34:51.640 --> 34:55.120
At stake, the opportunity
for Cody to rejoin

34:55.120 --> 34:58.090
the game as if he never left.

34:58.090 --> 35:02.500
Remember, if Cody wins,
he's back in the game.

35:02.500 --> 35:05.170
But if Paul, the
house challenger wins,

35:05.170 --> 35:10.000
Cody will immediately leave the
game for good and head home.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.120
Cody, you have already
played this game.

35:13.120 --> 35:17.330
But this time, the
maze is different.

35:17.330 --> 35:21.640
This competition is called Maze
Race, and here's how it works.

35:21.640 --> 35:25.490
On my go, you must maneuver
your ball through the maze using

35:25.490 --> 35:28.760
a rope and pulley system to
get your ball to the finish

35:28.760 --> 35:31.310
at the other end of the maze.

35:31.310 --> 35:32.430
Sounds easy enough.

35:32.430 --> 35:35.520
But if your ball
falls through a hole,

35:35.520 --> 35:39.010
you will need to collect
it and start over.

35:39.010 --> 35:42.520
Do you both understand?

35:42.520 --> 35:44.740
I know I beat Cody in his
own game a few weeks ago

35:44.740 --> 35:46.180
and sent him out of this house.

35:46.180 --> 35:47.800
But if he comes
back in this house,

35:47.800 --> 35:49.420
it's going to be a
whole other headache.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.520
And I know he's going
to be gunning it for me.

35:51.520 --> 35:54.100
So, I really gotta pull
this one out and make

35:54.100 --> 35:57.310
sure he doesn't come back in.

35:57.310 --> 36:00.310
Now that I made it this far,
I cannot lose this last comp.

36:00.310 --> 36:01.630
Jess is looking on.

36:01.630 --> 36:03.050
Everyone's looking on.

36:03.050 --> 36:05.290
It definitely is a
battle of the alphas.

36:05.290 --> 36:08.020
Me and Paul have faced
off head-to-head before,

36:08.020 --> 36:10.350
and I came out on top.

36:10.350 --> 36:13.040
I gotta win this thing
and get back in the house.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.180
This competition starts now.

36:34.980 --> 36:36.630
Cody's played
this game before.

36:36.630 --> 36:37.560
I'm new at this.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.270
So I gotta figure out
this pulley system.

36:39.270 --> 36:41.940
Because I'm pulling one way,
it's going the other way--

36:41.940 --> 36:43.080
not as easy as I thought.

36:51.450 --> 36:54.210
Even though I've done this
before, it's a different maze.

36:54.210 --> 36:57.020
So I have to maintain my focus.

36:57.020 --> 36:57.830
This is anybody's game.

37:06.990 --> 37:07.860
Come on, Paul.

37:07.860 --> 37:08.980
You need to win this showdown.

37:08.980 --> 37:10.740
You need to send Cody
home for good this time.

37:37.290 --> 37:39.130
I really can't let down
the other HouseGuests,

37:39.130 --> 37:40.800
because I'm pretty
sure none of them

37:40.800 --> 37:41.980
want Cody back in this house.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.880
So I really gotta
pull this out, Paul.

37:43.880 --> 37:44.690
Come on, Paul.

37:44.690 --> 37:45.780
Do it for friendship.

37:45.780 --> 37:46.710
Do it for the HouseGuests.

37:46.710 --> 37:47.910
Keep Cody out of this game.

38:02.910 --> 38:05.320
I glance over,
look at Paul's maze.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.490
He's behind me.

38:06.490 --> 38:09.280
I just gotta maintain a slow
and steady pace at this point.

38:13.550 --> 38:14.960
The longer I play
this game, the more

38:14.960 --> 38:16.160
I get the feel for this thing.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.170
And I slowly start
to pick up the pace.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.900
I don't really want to pay
attention to Cody's board

38:19.900 --> 38:21.230
and freak myself out.

38:21.230 --> 38:23.150
I'd rather him just
freak himself out.

38:23.150 --> 38:25.460
So I'm just
concentrating on my ball

38:25.460 --> 38:28.080
and making sure it's not
going anywhere near any hole.

38:36.270 --> 38:40.380
I hit panic mode when
Cody gets in the lead.

38:40.380 --> 38:43.000
At this point, I'm losing it.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.440
I'm seeing that he has
a good lead over Paul,

38:45.440 --> 38:47.780
and this kid might be
walking back in the house.

39:05.780 --> 39:07.590
Paul's behind, but
all we need right now

39:07.590 --> 39:08.940
is for Cody's ball to drop.

39:08.940 --> 39:10.260
And then it's a game changer.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.780
We could pull ahead
at any moment.

39:31.810 --> 39:33.020
Cody's in the lead.

39:33.020 --> 39:35.780
And if he blows this,
I will kill him.

39:35.780 --> 39:37.760
I need him here in this game.

39:37.760 --> 39:39.450
I can't do it alone.

39:39.450 --> 39:41.430
Please, Cody, win this for me.

39:54.230 --> 39:56.030
JULIE CHEN:
Congratulations, Cody.

39:56.030 --> 39:59.510
You have won the
Battle Back Showdown.

39:59.510 --> 40:02.570
And you are back in the game.

40:02.570 --> 40:04.370
This is literally
divine intervention.

40:04.370 --> 40:07.310
I am extremely happy
that I just won this.

40:07.310 --> 40:09.170
I get to spend more
time with Jess.

40:09.170 --> 40:11.420
I'm excited for my second
chance in this house.

40:11.420 --> 40:12.860
Paul said he was a
good chess player,

40:12.860 --> 40:15.230
but if he was, he would
have bet on the Battle Back,

40:15.230 --> 40:16.390
which he didn't.

40:16.390 --> 40:18.770
Now when I get back in the
game, his safety is over.

40:18.770 --> 40:20.570
Once I get the chance,
I want to take him out.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.650
OK.

40:25.650 --> 40:27.600
Cody finishes
the maze, and that

40:27.600 --> 40:29.040
means he's back in the house.

40:32.350 --> 40:35.470
Cody winning is absolutely
the best-case scenario.

40:35.470 --> 40:37.060
I'm so happy.

40:37.060 --> 40:39.400
I have been playing
this game alone.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.500
And I feel like between
him and I, we can really,

40:42.500 --> 40:45.660
really turn this game around.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.300
Cody wins, and I'm stunned.

40:47.300 --> 40:49.300
I'm pissed off.

40:49.300 --> 40:52.120
He threw my name under the
bus to every single person

40:52.120 --> 40:53.790
in this house before he left.

40:53.790 --> 40:56.810
And now I don't know what
he's going to stir up.

40:56.810 --> 40:59.160
Cody wins the
Battle Back Showdown,

40:59.160 --> 41:00.990
and this completely sucks.

41:00.990 --> 41:02.490
I think Paul gave
it his best shot.

41:02.490 --> 41:04.300
He definitely played
for the house.

41:04.300 --> 41:05.580
Mad respect to the kid.

41:05.580 --> 41:11.020
But now we just gotta find a way
to get Cody back out the door.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.010
So pissed!

41:16.010 --> 41:19.230
Look, Cody, you're
the ball maze master.

41:19.230 --> 41:20.950
But don't get too
comfortable, buddy.

41:20.950 --> 41:22.840
Enjoy your celebrations
while you can.

41:22.840 --> 41:26.010
But remember, I got you
out of this house before,

41:26.010 --> 41:29.260
and I'm not afraid
to do it again.

41:29.260 --> 41:31.810
JULIE CHEN: But nobody
should get too comfortable.

41:31.810 --> 41:36.790
The Head of Household
competition will begin shortly.

41:36.790 --> 41:39.280
Goodnight, HouseGuests.

41:39.280 --> 41:44.230
So, Cody is back in the game
and could become the new HOH.

41:44.230 --> 41:47.780
Tune in Sunday to see how
his return shakes things up

41:47.780 --> 41:50.470
and who is nominated
for eviction.

41:50.470 --> 41:53.080
Then on Wednesday, the
Power of Veto competition

41:53.080 --> 41:55.050
could change those nominations.

41:55.050 --> 41:58.870
And live next Thursday, another
guest will be sent packing,

41:58.870 --> 42:02.080
and the consequence of the
final Den of Temptation

42:02.080 --> 42:03.470
will be revealed.

42:03.470 --> 42:09.470

For now, let's eavesdrop on
the HouseGuests as Cody returns

42:24.070 --> 42:25.210
to the game.

42:25.210 --> 42:28.210
From outside the "Big Brother"
house, I'm Julie Chen.

42:28.210 --> 42:30.090
Good night.

42:35.530 --> 42:37.010
Yeah, you were close.

42:43.930 --> 42:46.890
Hey, but he did say
Cameron almost beat him.

42:49.760 --> 42:53.710
We were launching
balls at this thing.

42:53.710 --> 42:57.180
And I-- and I kid you
not, he was up, like, 7-1.

42:57.180 --> 42:57.880
Not Malcolm.
