00:30.464 --> 00:32.800
- UPSTAIRS.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.242
- [laughs]

00:41.275 --> 00:43.144
DAMN, BOHANNON.
DON'T YOU KNOW INTERRUPTING

00:43.177 --> 00:45.279
A FEDERAL MARSHAL
WHILE HE IS CONDUCTING BUSINESS

00:45.313 --> 00:46.647
IS AGAINST THE LAW?

00:46.680 --> 00:49.650
- [clicks tongue]
NEVER FIGURED YOU FOR A LAWMAN.

00:49.683 --> 00:54.188
- YEAH, WELL,
JOB DOES HAVE ITS ADVANTAGES.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.690
- COME TO SEE MY WORKERS
RELEASED.

00:56.724 --> 00:59.493
- YOUR CRIMINALS, YOU MEAN.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.162
- YOU HAVE 'EM DOWN AT THE DEPOT
BY THE TIME

01:01.195 --> 01:02.830
THE MORNING TRAIN ARRIVES,
ALL RIGHT?

01:02.863 --> 01:04.565
- AND LEAVE MY LADY
ALL BY HER LONESOME?

01:04.598 --> 01:05.799
I DON'T THINK SO.

01:05.833 --> 01:09.303
I THINK I'M COMFY RIGHT HERE.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.739
DAMN, BOHANNON.
YOU'RE ALL TWISTED UP.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.375
YOU MIGHT COULD USE A GOOD POKE.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.709
FRANCINE, WHY DON'T YOU
GO OVER THERE AND SEE

01:15.743 --> 01:18.146
IF YOU CAN HELP COLONEL OUT?

01:20.581 --> 01:22.183
COME ON, NOW.

01:22.216 --> 01:25.153
I AIN'T GONNA TELL THE MISSUS.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.267
- THIS HERE FIGHT'S
BETWEEN DURANT AND CAMPBELL.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.369
GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU AND ME.

01:41.402 --> 01:44.172
- WELL, THIS HERE BADGE
SAYS I WORK FOR CAMPBELL.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.873
LAST I HEARD,
YOU WORK FOR DURANT,

01:45.906 --> 01:50.278
SO RECKON THAT MAKES THIS HERE
FIGHT 'TWEEN US, DON'T YOU?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.446
- YOU'RE WORKING
FOR A CARPETBAGGER.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.182
- [chuckles]

01:54.182 --> 01:57.685
MY LOYALTY RUNS THE LENGTH
OF A DOLLAR BILL THESE DAYS.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.621
- LET GO OF MY MEN.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.191
- WHAT SAY I DON'T?

02:10.298 --> 02:13.634
IF YOU'D COME TO KILL ME,
I'D BE DEAD ALREADY.

02:17.905 --> 02:23.644
- MY MEN, AT THE DEPOT,
10:00 A.M.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.351
- YOU DONE LOST YOUR NERVE.

02:33.821 --> 02:37.225
MM.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.660
- THAT'S FOR PUTTING A GUN
ON MY WIFE AND BOY.

NEXT TIME I WON'T KNOCK.

TWO WEEKS TO DIG THE GRADE.

03:29.410 --> 03:33.314
WE'LL BE OVER SHERMAN PEAK
IN A MONTH, LARAMIE BY JULY.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.648
- IT WON'T BUILD ITSELF.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.317
- MEN'LL BUILD IT.

03:36.350 --> 03:37.618
- ALL THE SKILLED MEN
ARE LOCKED UP

03:37.651 --> 03:39.687
THANKS TO YOUR FRIEND
SIDNEY SNOW.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.689
- YOU LET ME WORRY ABOUT HIM.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.558
[chains jingling]

03:47.428 --> 03:50.531
- WHATEVER YOU'RE THINKING,
BOHANNON, DON'T.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.300
LEAVE SNOW TO HIS JOB,
US TO OURS.

03:56.470 --> 04:00.308
- GOT A MESSAGE FOR YOU
FROM THE NEW MARSHAL.

04:00.341 --> 04:01.975
- SPIT IT OUT, DUTCH.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.714
- HE SAID, "YOU WANT THE MEN?

04:06.747 --> 04:09.317
COME AND GET 'EM."

04:18.626 --> 04:20.528
- YOU SEE THIS, BOHANNON?

04:20.561 --> 04:23.497
"KNOWN KILLER HIRED AS MARSHAL."

04:23.531 --> 04:27.401
I MEAN, WHAT IS THE WORLD
COMING TO?

04:27.435 --> 04:30.371
- I GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO LET GO OF THEM MEN EASY-LIKE.

04:30.404 --> 04:34.342
- THEN I GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO LET 'EM OUT YOURSELF.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.352
COME ON BACK ANYTIME!

04:53.661 --> 04:55.396
- GOOD MORNING.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.498
- NO, IT AIN'T.

05:02.536 --> 05:06.774
- DUTCH, GET YOUR ASS
BACK IN THERE.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.709
[chains jingling]

05:13.381 --> 05:18.419
- IF MR. BOHANNON
SHOULD GET ANY IDEAS...

05:18.452 --> 05:21.589
STEP A HAIR OUT OF LINE TODAY...
- ARREST HIM?

05:21.622 --> 05:23.424
- SHOOT HIM.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.063
- WELL, IT'S ABOUT TIME.

05:30.097 --> 05:33.734
- TIME, MR. DURANT,

05:33.767 --> 05:37.805
IS A FICKLE MISTRESS.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.140
FIRST IT APPEARS
AN ENDLESS SUPPLY,

05:40.173 --> 05:45.513
AND THEN SUDDENLY
THE LAST FEW GRAINS OF SAND

05:45.546 --> 05:47.415
TRICKLE DOWN THE HOURGLASS.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.950
- FOR GOD'S SAKES, JOHN.

05:49.983 --> 05:54.855
PERSECUTING ME ON TRUMPED-UP
CHARGES IS POLITICAL SUICIDE.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.624
YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE

05:56.657 --> 06:00.127
THAT I HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MARSHAL HECKARD'S DEATH.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.995
YOU'VE NO WITNESS.
NO PROOF.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.798
- THAT'S FOR THE JUDGE IN OMAHA
TO DETERMINE.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.467
- OMAHA?

06:06.500 --> 06:09.970
- ALL OF YOU WILL BE RETURNED
TO THE JURISDICTIONS

06:10.003 --> 06:13.774
IN WHICH YOUR ALLEGED CRIMES
WERE COMMITTED.

06:13.807 --> 06:18.612
YOU WILL ACQUIT YOURSELF THERE
FOR BETTER OR WORSE.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.885
- I CAN'T GO BACK
TO ALABAMA, MR. CAMPBELL.

06:27.588 --> 06:32.726
- YOU HAVE MR. DURANT
TO THANK FOR THAT.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.995
THE TRAIN LEAVES TODAY.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.831
- YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

06:37.865 --> 06:39.967
- OH, I CAN...

06:40.000 --> 06:42.470
AND I AM.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.079
[steer moos]

06:52.112 --> 06:54.915
- I NEED YOUR RANCHERS, MAGGIE.

06:54.948 --> 06:58.886
CAN'T FIGHT CAMPBELL ON MY OWN.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.021
- MY HUSBAND BUILT UP
A SMALL RANCH OUT HERE

07:01.054 --> 07:02.723
WHEN THERE WAS NOTHING
BUT ROLLING HILLS

07:02.756 --> 07:05.493
AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.928
WE HAD A HOUSE, SMALL HERD.
- COME ON.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.030
- HOLD 'EM STEADY NOW.

07:10.063 --> 07:13.734
- AND IN EARLY SEPTEMBER '58,
ONE OF OUR HANDS--

07:13.767 --> 07:17.204
A DOWN-ON-HIS-LUCK COWPOKE,
A JACK SOMEBODY--

07:17.237 --> 07:19.039
HE LED A BUNCH OF RUSTLERS.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.542
TORE THROUGH OUR HERD.

07:21.575 --> 07:23.844
LOST MY HUSBAND THAT NIGHT.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.013
MY RANCH A MONTH LATER.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.749
I HAD TO REBUILD IT ALL,
AND I DID...

07:28.782 --> 07:33.754
WITH BLOOD, SWEAT,
AND WHATEVER ELSE IT TOOK.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.724
SIDNEY SNOW, HE'S
CAMPBELL'S BRAND ON THIS TOWN.

07:36.757 --> 07:40.594
FIGHTING HIM IS ONLY GONNA LEAD
TO MORE BLOODSHED.

07:40.628 --> 07:43.263
- SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO TAKE A STAND.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.098
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
MY HUSBAND SAID

07:45.132 --> 07:48.235
JUST BEFORE JACK KILLED HIM.

07:48.268 --> 07:53.106
CAMPBELL WON'T LET GO, CULLEN.
YOU KNOW THAT.

07:53.140 --> 07:56.243
I'M OFF TO THE NORTH VALLEY.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.579
- THOUGHT THAT WAS
MICKEY MCGINNES'S LAND.

07:58.612 --> 08:02.950
- SOLD IT TO ME YESTERDAY
FOR 10Â¢ ON THE DOLLAR.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.619
- Y-YOU SAID THIS WAS YESTERDAY?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.921
- HOLD ON TO YOUR TOPKNOT,
MR. BOHANNON.

08:19.867 --> 08:21.902
[bird calls]

08:27.875 --> 08:30.177
- CAMPBELL
JUST REQUISITIONED A TRAIN.

08:30.210 --> 08:34.281
HE'S SENDING THE WORKERS
BACK EAST.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.149
BOHANNON...

08:36.183 --> 08:38.285
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

08:38.318 --> 08:41.188
- MEANS I GOT LESS TIME
THAN I THOUGHT.

08:47.127 --> 08:51.098
- THOUGHT YOU
WERE THE NEW MARSHAL.

08:51.131 --> 08:55.803
- THOUGHT YOU TURNED TAIL
AND RUN.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.006
- COME BACK WITH A PLAN, I DID.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.942
I GOT MEN COMING.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.977
ANY DAY NOW.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.280
- CAMPBELL'S SHIPPING DURANT
AND THE MEN BACK EAST.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.282
- I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS
TO THAT JUDAS DURANT.

09:09.316 --> 09:10.984
HE DESERVES
WHAT HE'S GOT COMING.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.187
- THE MEN DON'T.

09:14.221 --> 09:18.659
- I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR RAILROAD, BOHANNON.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.794
I'VE GOT ME OWN TRAVAILS.

09:20.828 --> 09:22.663
WHEN MY MEN ARRIVE,

09:22.696 --> 09:25.633
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THESE CAMPBELL
BASTARDS MESELF, ALL RIGHT?

09:25.633 --> 09:29.202
- YOU'RE LIKELY TO FIND YOURSELF
ON THE WRONG END OF A ROPE.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.304
- THAT'S NO BUSINESS OF YOURS.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.041
YOU SHOULD TAKE YOUR WIFE
AND MOVE ON FROM HERE.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.744
- MY WIFE AND CHILD
ARE BACK AT FORT SMITH.

09:36.777 --> 09:41.181
IT'S THE RAILROAD
NEEDS MOVING NOW.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.184
- CAMPBELL'S NOT JUST GONNA
HAND OVER THESE WORKERS.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.019
- WE'RE GONNA BREAK 'EM OUT.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.320
TODAY.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.056
- YOU AND ME?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.391
TWO MEN AGAINST ALL THEM?

09:51.424 --> 09:55.195
- ALL THEM AMOUNTS
TO ONE MAN: SIDNEY SNOW.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.832
- IT COULD BE SUICIDE.

09:58.866 --> 10:00.768
- DOING NOTHING
AIN'T A CHOICE, MICK.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.712
- MOST OF THEM ARE DRUNKARDS
AND SHITPOKES.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.246
HALF WILL FOLD
IF THE BULLETS START FLYING,

10:13.280 --> 10:16.149
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF SIDNEY.
[door opens]

10:18.285 --> 10:20.821
- WASH UP FOR LUNCH?

10:26.226 --> 10:28.662
- WE'LL NEED GUNS,
AND LOTS OF 'EM.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.132
- MOST OF 'EM WON'T BE EXPECTING
A FIGHT NOR READY FOR ONE.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.234
SURPRISE IS BETTER THAN BULLETS.

10:34.267 --> 10:35.736
- I'LL TAKE THE SURPRISE,

10:35.769 --> 10:37.370
BUT I'LL BE HAVING ME BULLETS
AS WELL.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.073
[door opens]

10:40.107 --> 10:41.875
- YOU SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.244
ALL THIS TALK OF GUNS
AND BULLETS?

10:44.277 --> 10:46.413
- WE WON'T TROUBLE YOU
AND EZRA MUCH LONGER.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.882
MICKEY.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.385
- APPRECIATE THE SANCTUARY,
RUTH.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.424
- HE'S EVIL, YOU KNOW.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.959
- MICKEY?

10:58.992 --> 11:03.096
- THAT NEW MARSHAL, SIDNEY SNOW.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.266
- LOT OF MEN LOST THEIR WAY
AFTER THE WAR.

11:06.299 --> 11:08.468
- HE'S NOT LOST, MR. BOHANNON.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.039
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS RESIDE
WITHIN HIM.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.810
I LOOKED INTO HIS EYES.

11:16.844 --> 11:20.213
I SAW A WICKEDNESS THERE
THAT IS YET TO BE UNLEASHED.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.357
BE CAREFUL.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.764
THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE HERE
WHO CARE FOR YOU.

12:16.937 --> 12:19.339
- YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, BOHANNON?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.909
JESUS AND ALL THAT SHIT?

12:21.942 --> 12:23.944
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD PEOPLE
PRAYING TO A GUY

12:23.977 --> 12:26.513
WHO LET HIMSELF GET CRUCIFIED.

12:26.546 --> 12:29.482
AND FOR WHAT?

12:29.516 --> 12:34.021
- I RECKON FAITH
AIN'T EASILY EXPLAINED TO SOME.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.027
- SEE, I STAND HERE AND I LOOK,

12:40.060 --> 12:42.362
AND I SEE CULLEN BOHANNON,

12:42.395 --> 12:46.834
BUT I SURE AS HELL
DON'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.270
THE JAIL, THE LOAD-UP,
OR THE FIRST WATER STOP.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.039
WHICH IT GONNA BE?

12:52.072 --> 12:54.241
I KNOW
YOU'RE PLANNING SOMETHING.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.409
- RAILROAD WORK.
- COME ON, NOW.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.047
LYING JUST OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
OF THE LORD?

13:00.080 --> 13:02.282
- IF YOU'RE SO SURE I'M LYING,
WHY DON'T YOU ARREST ME?

13:02.315 --> 13:05.986
- WELL, SHIT, I DON'T WANT
TO RUIN ALL THE FUN.

13:08.388 --> 13:13.226
- AIN'T TOO LATE TO WALK AWAY.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.529
- YEAH, IT IS...

13:16.563 --> 13:18.565
FOR BOTH OF US.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.372
- HMM.

13:25.405 --> 13:27.240
BEST PRAY ON IT THEN.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.576
JUST TO BE SAFE.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.312
- OH, I LEAVE THE PRAYING
TO YOU.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.882
YOU GONNA NEED IT.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.924
- I GOT NO FEUD WITH CAMPBELL.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.093
- HE ARRESTED YOUR WORKERS!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.161
AND YOUR BOSS.

13:48.195 --> 13:52.632
- DURANT DUG HIS OWN GRAVE, AS I
KNEW HE WOULD SOONER OR LATER.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.434
- ROAD WON'T GET BUILT
WITHOUT HIM.

13:54.467 --> 13:58.171
- GOING TO WAR WITH THE GOVERNOR
IS INSURRECTION, MR. BOHANNON.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.907
- WOULDN'T BE MY FIRST DO-SI-DO.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.441
- YOU'LL WIND UP IN PRISON
OR WORSE.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.511
- YEAH, DANCED THAT NUMBER
LIKEWISE.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.914
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

14:06.914 --> 14:10.250
- LOOKING FOR THE KEYS
TO THE DAMN ARMORY...

14:14.955 --> 14:16.924
AND A PARTNER.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.630
- MR. BOHANNON, I'M AN ENGINEER,
NOT A GUNSLINGER.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.466
- YOU WORK FOR
THE UNION PACIFIC, MR. DELANEY.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.501
THAT'S A DREAM FOR SOME.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.038
FOR OTHERS, IT'S AN OBSESSION.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.040
MY GRANDDADDY
TORE HISSELF A COTTON EMPIRE

14:33.073 --> 14:34.641
OUT OF SWAMP BOTTOM AND A SUN,

14:34.674 --> 14:37.544
AND I AIM TO DO SIMILAR
WITH THIS HERE RAILROAD.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.479
SO YOU EITHER GIVE ME
THEM KEYS,

14:39.512 --> 14:41.448
OR YOU GET OUT OF MY WAY.

14:53.093 --> 14:56.129
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.331
- YOU GOT A PLAN...

14:58.365 --> 15:00.968
I HOPE.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.974
- THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.986
- YOU SURPRISE ME, MISS ELLISON.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.653
- A NICE DINNER
AND A GLASS OF WINE

15:20.687 --> 15:22.155
DON'T CHANGE THE TRUTH,
MR. CAMPBELL.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.424
- NOR WOULD I EXPECT THEM TO.

15:24.457 --> 15:28.028
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT YOU TO LEND
ANY CREDENCE IN YOUR ARTICLE

15:28.061 --> 15:31.498
TO MY POSITION
OVER THAT OF MR. BOHANNON'S.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.600
- MR. BOHANNON SEES THE WORLD
IN BLACK AND WHITE.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.503
- BUT WE DON'T, DO WE?

15:36.536 --> 15:39.506

HAVE IN COMMON, MR. CAMPBELL...

15:39.539 --> 15:41.208
AMONG OTHER THINGS...

15:41.241 --> 15:43.510
IS THE CERTAINTY THAT THE WORLD
IS NEITHER BLACK NOR WHITE

15:43.543 --> 15:45.178
BUT DECIDEDLY GRAY.

15:45.212 --> 15:49.249
THAT'S WHAT MAKES
IT BOTH DAUNTING AND,

15:49.282 --> 15:52.385
AT TIMES, ALLURING.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.287

15:57.624 --> 16:00.293
PERHAPS IT WOULDN'T BE
INTOLERABLE

16:00.327 --> 16:03.096
TO DISCUSS THE WORLD,

16:03.130 --> 16:05.565
IN ALL ITS SHADES OF GRAY,

16:05.598 --> 16:10.070
OVER LUNCH AT THE PALMER?

16:10.103 --> 16:15.042
- THAT WOULDN'T BE INTOLERABLE
AT ALL, MR. CAMPBELL.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.478

YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

17:57.544 --> 17:59.379

17:59.412 --> 18:01.348
HE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS NOTHING, OR
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BY NOW!

18:01.381 --> 18:04.817
- YEAH, YOU KEEP SQUAWKING,
YOU'LL BE NEXT, HUCKLEBERRY.

18:04.851 --> 18:09.422
NOW, I KNOW BOHANNON IS PLANNING
ON BUSTING THESE MEN OUT...

18:09.456 --> 18:14.227
AND I KNOW THAT YOU
ARE A PART OF IT.

18:14.261 --> 18:16.763
SO...

18:21.168 --> 18:22.702
WHY WON'T HE TALK TO ME,
PARKER?

18:22.735 --> 18:24.437
- I DON'T KNOW, SID.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.572
MAYBE HE DON'T LIKE YOU.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.440
- DOESN'T LIKE ME?

18:27.474 --> 18:29.442

18:39.619 --> 18:41.421

18:41.454 --> 18:43.523
NO MORE.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.891
THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.637
HE'S GONNA BUST THE MEN OUT.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.407
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.809
WHERE?

19:02.842 --> 19:05.712
THE JAIL? THE LOAD-UP?

19:05.745 --> 19:08.815
THE FIRST WATER STOP?

19:08.848 --> 19:12.585

19:12.619 --> 19:15.788
- GET US OUT IN THE OPEN.
THAT'S SMART.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.224
WHAT ELSE?

19:20.760 --> 19:23.463
- THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.398
I SWEAR.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.237
- LOCK HIM UP.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.345
PREP THE PRISONERS
FOR LOAD-UP.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.746
- WE AIN'T LEAVING
FOR TWO HOURS.

19:39.779 --> 19:40.913
- ADAPT OR DIE, ATWOOD.

19:40.947 --> 19:44.784
ADAPT OR DIE.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.319
- WE STILL NEED TO SWEEP
THE TOWN.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.421

19:48.455 --> 19:50.723
AND NEITHER DOES BOHANNON.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.778
TO ENDURE A BEATING LIKE THAT
AND KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT.

22:58.811 --> 23:02.449
- BOHANNON WAS OUR LAST CHANCE
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

23:04.917 --> 23:09.622
I GO BACK TO ALABAMA,
I'M A DEAD MAN.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.823

23:19.699 --> 23:20.867
FIGHTING AMONGST OURSELVES--

23:22.769 --> 23:26.739
IT'S 'CAUSE OF YOU WE IN HERE.

23:26.773 --> 23:29.476
GOT TO SAY FOR YOURSELF, IRISH?
HUH?

23:56.035 --> 23:59.205

24:50.289 --> 24:51.624

WASN'T HE?

24:55.094 --> 24:56.996
HIM AND THAT LYING
SHIT-ASS IRISHMAN.

24:57.029 --> 25:00.066
- I'VE DONE NOTHING.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.569
I HAVE NOTHING FOR YOU.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.779
- DON'T BE PLAYING WITH FIRE,
CHURCH LADY.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.811

26:55.848 --> 26:57.950

27:00.887 --> 27:04.190
- CONSIDERING YOUR PAST...

27:04.223 --> 27:06.292
ROMANTIC PREDILECTIONS.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.298
- YOU HAVE BEEN
CURIOUS ABOUT ME.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.801
- I'VE MADE INQUIRIES.

27:20.172 --> 27:25.044
- WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I USED
TO THINK IT MADE ME ABNORMAL.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.082
BUT AFTER MY TIME
COVERING THE WAR,

27:30.116 --> 27:33.385
I REALIZED THAT THERE WERE MEN

28:00.312 --> 28:03.149
WHEN I GET WHAT I DESERVE...

28:03.182 --> 28:07.286
WITHOUT A FIGHT...

28:07.319 --> 28:11.190
WITHOUT REGRET.

28:11.223 --> 28:16.896
- [laughs]

28:18.230 --> 28:20.767
IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

28:24.871 --> 28:28.040
