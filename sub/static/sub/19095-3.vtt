Nah, I mean you're not cool,
but you're not uncool.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.023
Kim Kil Whan!
Bronwyn! Look at me!

10:58.025 --> 11:00.091
[ Grunts ]

11:00.093 --> 11:01.526
Time to go home.

11:01.528 --> 11:04.329
Not the swan, that's where
the pups came from.

11:07.767 --> 11:11.670
Come along with me

11:11.672 --> 11:15.440
And the butterflies and bees
