00:07.081 --> 00:08.349
<i>Previously on The Affair...</i>

00:08.350 --> 00:09.919
Mom, this is Furkat.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.121
<i>Are you two working together?</i>

00:11.122 --> 00:12.758
I'm his assistant.

00:12.759 --> 00:14.662
<i>You can tell me how
what you're doing</i>

00:14.663 --> 00:16.265
<i>is any different... you know,
Vik living in your basement,</i>

00:16.265 --> 00:18.135
<i>paying you rent, while
also fucking you.</i>

00:18.136 --> 00:20.139
<i>I don't mention one lunch
and that's a problem?</i>

00:20.140 --> 00:21.441
What about you driving two hours

00:21.442 --> 00:22.978
to see your ex without telling me?

00:22.979 --> 00:24.314
Yeah, I never should've told you!

00:24.315 --> 00:25.517
You live in the fucking basement,

00:25.518 --> 00:26.686
and you come up when you feel like it;

00:26.687 --> 00:28.155
You stay down when you feel like it.

00:28.156 --> 00:30.026
<i>It's what you said you wanted.</i>

00:30.027 --> 00:31.796
<i>Because I thought
that's what you wanted.</i>

00:31.797 --> 00:33.633
<i>Home, sweet home. I
do have one request.</i>

00:33.634 --> 00:35.069
I know. You don't have to say it.

00:35.070 --> 00:36.639
I'm done with him, really.

00:36.640 --> 00:37.708
Okay.

00:37.709 --> 00:39.177
<i>Is Noah here?</i>

00:39.178 --> 00:40.981
I'm concerned about him
because he was stabbed

00:40.982 --> 00:42.317
and now he's MIA.

00:42.318 --> 00:44.054
Why does he still matter so much to you?

00:44.055 --> 00:45.724
What?

00:45.725 --> 00:47.761
I could never figure out if
you're just so narcissistic

00:47.762 --> 00:49.230
that you weren't paying attention.

00:49.231 --> 00:51.401
- Excuse me?
- Our mother had just died.

00:51.402 --> 00:55.076
Noah was using you to
get the fuck away from us.

00:55.077 --> 00:56.913
<i>- My dad died.
- Did your dad</i>

00:56.914 --> 00:58.717
<i>- leave you anything?
- His house.</i>

00:58.718 --> 01:00.453
<i>When was the last
time you were there?</i>

01:00.454 --> 01:01.623
<i>Twenty years ago.</i>

01:01.624 --> 01:03.960
<i>My mother died there.</i>

01:03.961 --> 01:05.831
<i>I think I know who attacked me.</i>

01:05.832 --> 01:08.402
<i>He's a guard at Fishkill
named John Gunther.</i>

01:08.403 --> 01:10.039
<i>He's been following
me since I got out.</i>

01:10.040 --> 01:11.174
- Fuck you!
- Dad?

01:11.175 --> 01:12.410
Martin, what...

01:12.411 --> 01:13.880
<i>Solloway?</i>

01:13.881 --> 01:15.149
I'm gonna hang on to this for safety.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.485
- Come on, don't...
- Hey!

01:20.394 --> 01:21.729
<i>Dad, are you okay?</i>

01:21.730 --> 01:23.232
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

01:23.233 --> 01:25.771
Either of you remember
a-a guy named Gunther?

01:25.772 --> 01:28.943
<i>Yeah, his folks own that
hunting store off 76.</i>

01:28.944 --> 01:31.014
Noah, you don't look so good.

01:33.888 --> 01:35.691
Fuck!

01:35.692 --> 01:37.093
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:37.094 --> 01:38.596
You're such a fucking mess.

01:38.597 --> 01:40.300
Martin, get up.

01:41.469 --> 01:42.871
Martin?

01:42.872 --> 01:44.909
Martin! Stop!

01:44.910 --> 01:46.211
Martin!

03:40.473 --> 03:42.243
I need help.

03:59.512 --> 04:01.549
I know you're screening my calls, Nina,

04:01.550 --> 04:03.352
but you might want to call me back,

04:03.353 --> 04:05.724
because...

04:05.725 --> 04:08.195
I found your brother
at your father's house,

04:08.196 --> 04:10.032
and he's not in great shape.

04:10.033 --> 04:11.569
I mean, he's all right.

04:11.570 --> 04:14.641
I'm taking care of him, but...

04:14.642 --> 04:16.077
I thought you should know.

04:16.077 --> 04:17.748
And I know that you're mad at me

04:17.749 --> 04:19.718
and JP's pissed at Noah,

04:19.719 --> 04:22.591
so you probably won't want him
coming up to... to West Orange,

04:22.592 --> 04:24.595
which, you know, that's fine.

04:24.596 --> 04:26.431
Fuck!

04:26.432 --> 04:28.736
Sorry, ignore that.

04:28.737 --> 04:30.874
Um...

04:30.875 --> 04:33.278
I mean, don't worry, because,

04:33.279 --> 04:36.552
Noah can stay here for now.

04:36.553 --> 04:39.858
I mean, I'm not sure what
I'm gonna tell the kids.

04:39.859 --> 04:42.898
Or Vik, I guess.

04:42.899 --> 04:44.568
Whatever, I'll make it work.

04:44.569 --> 04:46.104
Um...

04:46.105 --> 04:50.046
but, just call me if you want.

04:51.048 --> 04:53.886
He's, um...

04:53.887 --> 04:56.124
I mean, I think he'll be okay.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.930
We'll be okay.

04:58.931 --> 05:01.234
Bye.

05:07.782 --> 05:09.384
Noah!

05:20.306 --> 05:23.312
Noah?

05:28.590 --> 05:31.595
How's it going?

05:31.596 --> 05:33.666
You've been in there for a while.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.402
Jesus Christ.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.574
Noah, what are you doing?

05:37.575 --> 05:39.011
Are you okay?

05:43.486 --> 05:45.456
I just needed to sit.

05:48.864 --> 05:51.201
Okay, come on.

05:51.202 --> 05:53.873
Come on, let's get you up.

05:53.874 --> 05:55.877
Can you try to stand?

05:55.878 --> 05:58.048
Crap.

05:58.049 --> 06:00.687
Sorry.

06:02.892 --> 06:05.462
You know what? You're probably dehydrated.

06:05.463 --> 06:10.272
And you need to eat and... sleep.

06:10.273 --> 06:12.244
So the bed's all made.

06:14.181 --> 06:16.284
- It's... I got it. I got it.
- What?

06:16.285 --> 06:18.522
I got it.

06:19.759 --> 06:20.828
Yeah, go ahead.

06:26.105 --> 06:28.308
Can I get some privacy?

06:28.309 --> 06:29.611
Sure.

06:29.612 --> 06:31.548
I just...

06:31.549 --> 06:32.952
Sure.

06:39.231 --> 06:41.235
Shit.

06:49.886 --> 06:51.822
You're back.

06:51.823 --> 06:53.425
- You're here.
- Yeah.

06:53.426 --> 06:55.897
Late start today. I
don't scrub in till noon.

06:57.868 --> 06:59.705
So?

06:59.706 --> 07:01.274
Tell me.

07:01.275 --> 07:02.777
Noah's not doing well?

07:02.778 --> 07:04.614
No, he's not.

07:04.615 --> 07:06.685
Okay, so did you reach Nina?

07:06.686 --> 07:08.054
She come to get him?

07:08.055 --> 07:10.225
Um, no, she didn't.

07:10.226 --> 07:11.696
So what'd you...

07:12.832 --> 07:15.469
You drive him to Jersey?

07:15.470 --> 07:18.041
Um...

07:18.042 --> 07:20.581
well, he's downstairs.

07:22.852 --> 07:25.690
Noah is downstairs?

07:25.691 --> 07:26.859
Right now?

07:26.860 --> 07:28.662
Yeah. Um, he's resting.

07:28.663 --> 07:30.933
But listen, just don't... Can
you please don't freak out?

07:30.934 --> 07:32.670
- I don't get it.
- I know. I couldn't reach Nina.

07:32.671 --> 07:35.943
And-and-and she's not
returning my calls, and I...

07:35.944 --> 07:37.246
You should've seen him.

07:37.247 --> 07:38.949
I mean, I found him standing in the lake.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.020
Like, just standing there, like a zombie.

07:41.021 --> 07:43.458
- And his neck is a mess.
- So you brought him here?

07:43.459 --> 07:45.228
Yes. He's not staying, I promise.

07:45.229 --> 07:47.567
- What about the kids?
- I'm not going to tell them.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.571
- You're not going to tell them?
- No!

07:49.572 --> 07:51.474
He's downstairs. He's not coming upstairs.

07:51.475 --> 07:53.579
I just need to figure
out what to do with him.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.081
And, Vik, he's their father.

07:55.082 --> 07:56.919
What was I supposed to do, leave him there?

07:56.920 --> 07:59.223
I did what anyone would do!

07:59.224 --> 08:01.528
Someone tried to kill him, Helen.

08:01.529 --> 08:03.031
They've got no idea who did it,

08:03.032 --> 08:05.603
they've got zero leads,
but sure, invite him in.

08:05.604 --> 08:07.272
What are you saying? You think
someone's still after him?

08:07.273 --> 08:09.945
- Who knows?
- I understand why you're upset.

08:09.946 --> 08:12.216
I-I... It's temporary, I promise.

08:12.217 --> 08:13.853
I'll find someplace else for him to go.

08:13.854 --> 08:15.355
Like, today?

08:15.356 --> 08:17.794
Yes.

08:17.795 --> 08:19.231
Today.

08:29.819 --> 08:33.926
Vik, do you think you have
time to take a look at him?

08:35.931 --> 08:37.467
Quick look?

08:42.912 --> 08:45.415
- Noah.
- Yeah?

08:45.416 --> 08:47.654
Vik said he can take a look
at you before he goes to work.

08:47.655 --> 08:50.091
I think you should let
him check out your neck.

08:50.092 --> 08:52.664
Dr. Ooh-la-la.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.433
Dr. Ullah.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.672
I'm out of my pain meds. I need some more.

08:56.673 --> 08:58.374
- Do you?
- Yeah.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.378
I might be able to help with that.

09:00.379 --> 09:02.382
I need to take a look at your wound first.

09:02.383 --> 09:04.621
Can you turn towards the light, please?

09:04.622 --> 09:06.893
He's trying to help you. Please.

09:12.103 --> 09:13.939
I took his temperature when we got home.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.177
It was 100.7. I gave him Advil.

09:16.178 --> 09:17.847
I don't need Advil. I need Vicodin.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.588
Okay, tough guy, hold still for me, please.

09:21.589 --> 09:23.626
How much Vicodin are you taking?

09:23.627 --> 09:27.166
7.5 milligrams six times a day.

09:28.637 --> 09:31.375
Or, I don't know, ten, maybe.

09:41.529 --> 09:42.830
What's that for?

09:42.831 --> 09:45.703
I'm marking where the red ends.

09:45.704 --> 09:47.640
Now, if it extends past this line

09:47.641 --> 09:48.976
or if his fever goes any higher,

09:48.977 --> 09:50.913
he'll need to go to the ER.

09:50.914 --> 09:53.418
In the meantime, I'll write
him a script for an antibiotic.

09:53.419 --> 09:55.523
- Two a day for ten days.
- An antibiotic?

09:55.524 --> 09:57.059
No, I need pain meds.

09:57.060 --> 09:58.662
It's been a pleasure.

09:58.663 --> 10:01.702
- Take care, Noah.
- You got to be kidding me.

10:01.703 --> 10:03.772
What kind of a doctor refuses medication

10:03.773 --> 10:05.409
to someone who's suffering?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.116
Are you really in that much pain?

10:09.117 --> 10:10.085
You got...

10:10.086 --> 10:11.187
You got to talk to him.

10:11.188 --> 10:12.255
Get him to give me something.

10:12.256 --> 10:14.393
- I can ask him...
- Beg.

10:14.394 --> 10:16.097
Okay, but k... will you please lie down?

10:16.098 --> 10:17.767
You need some rest. But wait a minute.

10:17.768 --> 10:20.206
We need to, cover you up first.

10:23.078 --> 10:26.417
Lean towards me.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.754
No, I got it. I got it.

10:27.755 --> 10:29.256
- Okay, right.
- It's fine.

10:29.257 --> 10:30.627
Sorry.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.436
<i>Helen.</i>

10:41.081 --> 10:43.451
Well, you're right about
one thing, the man's a mess.

10:43.452 --> 10:44.988
Can't you just give him a little Vicodin?

10:44.989 --> 10:47.292
No, no, I can't give
him "a little" Vicodin.

10:47.293 --> 10:49.163
He's clearly addicted to Vicodin.

10:49.164 --> 10:50.666
I could lose my medical license

10:50.667 --> 10:53.204
for prescribing opioids to a man like that.

10:53.205 --> 10:56.277
- Is Percocet an opioid?
- I want him out.

10:56.278 --> 10:58.949
Nina can take him to his doctor
if his neck gets any worse.

10:58.950 --> 11:01.555
And she may want to check
him into a rehab facility.

11:01.556 --> 11:02.957
Really?

11:02.958 --> 11:04.794
- You think he's that bad?
- Helen.

11:04.795 --> 11:06.631
Open your eyes.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.169
This man's problem is much
bigger than you or I can handle.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.973
And the kids should not see him like that.

11:10.974 --> 11:12.275
I know. I'll call Nina.
I'll have her come today.

11:12.276 --> 11:14.012
She's his sister.

11:14.013 --> 11:15.415
If anyone has an obligation

11:15.416 --> 11:17.018
to him at this point, it's her, not you.

11:17.019 --> 11:18.321
She'll pick him up, Vik, okay?

11:18.322 --> 11:21.327
It's not a problem, I promise.

11:23.265 --> 11:25.034
I do. Just go to work.

11:25.035 --> 11:28.341
He'll be gone by the time you get home.

11:28.342 --> 11:30.546
I'll call the Augmentin in to Rite-Aid.

11:30.547 --> 11:32.449
Thank you.

11:36.626 --> 11:38.996
Okay, um...

11:38.997 --> 11:40.231
Tylenol with codeine.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.703
Noah, it's the only thing

11:42.704 --> 11:44.541
I have in the house, I'm sorry.

11:47.714 --> 11:50.686
And just be careful
because that's hot-hot.

11:50.687 --> 11:52.523
Here, give me the bottle. I need some more.

11:52.524 --> 11:55.194
<i>Vik thinks that you are taking
too much medicine.</i>

11:55.195 --> 11:58.034
Well, Vik has a stick up his ass.

11:58.035 --> 12:00.572
He also hates me, Helen.

12:00.573 --> 12:02.208
Please, Helen, just give me a few more,

12:02.209 --> 12:03.612
just enough to control this pain.

12:03.613 --> 12:05.015
Okay, fine.

12:10.694 --> 12:12.462
I also brought an Ambien.

12:12.463 --> 12:13.866
Beautiful.

12:17.841 --> 12:20.078
I really think you should
try to eat something.

12:20.079 --> 12:21.480
I'm not hungry, thanks.

12:21.481 --> 12:22.917
They're poppy seed, and I got...

12:22.918 --> 12:24.220
I said I didn't want it, Helen.

12:34.675 --> 12:36.678
Who was that?

12:36.679 --> 12:39.917
- No one.
- It's not no one, Noah.

12:39.918 --> 12:41.721
Who's calling you? Was it Nina?

12:41.722 --> 12:43.357
No.

12:46.064 --> 12:47.600
Who's Officer Santos?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.469
Is that one of the
detectives from your case?

12:49.470 --> 12:50.706
'Cause you should call him back.

12:50.707 --> 12:52.576
She's my parole officer.

12:52.577 --> 12:54.547
Well, then you should
definitely call her back.

12:54.548 --> 12:56.818
Yeah, not right now. I can't
deal with her right now.

12:56.819 --> 13:01.126
It'll take two minutes, Noah.
Just let her know you're okay.

13:01.127 --> 13:02.731
But I'm not.

13:13.418 --> 13:16.925
What is going on with you, Noah?

13:16.926 --> 13:18.795
What is it?

13:29.751 --> 13:31.286
God, I'm tired.

13:31.287 --> 13:33.091
I think I can finally sleep.

13:35.462 --> 13:37.298
Good.

13:37.299 --> 13:38.802
That's great.

13:38.803 --> 13:42.408
Maybe the pills started working?

13:42.409 --> 13:44.179
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:53.031 --> 13:55.870
Actually feels nice to be back here.

14:00.112 --> 14:01.615
It does?

14:05.088 --> 14:07.761
Nice hearing the kids again.

14:09.497 --> 14:11.568
The kids?

14:11.569 --> 14:14.273
Are they coming down?

14:16.244 --> 14:17.613
Well, the kids aren't here, Noah.

14:17.614 --> 14:20.084
They're at school.

14:20.085 --> 14:21.921
That's good.

15:00.265 --> 15:01.366
I'm not Noah.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.705
I'm Helen.

15:03.706 --> 15:05.942
I'm his wife... his ex-wife.

15:05.943 --> 15:08.014
He's with me in-in Brooklyn.

15:10.452 --> 15:12.956
Yes, Officer, I know.

15:12.957 --> 15:15.361
I get that, I...

15:15.362 --> 15:17.900
Well, I can't put him on.

15:17.901 --> 15:20.004
Because I can't.

15:20.005 --> 15:21.541
He's sleeping.

15:23.178 --> 15:24.914
Shit. Can you hold on a second?

15:24.915 --> 15:26.684
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Whitney.

15:26.685 --> 15:27.753
Hey, what are you...

15:27.754 --> 15:29.890
Whitney?

15:29.891 --> 15:31.193
Hello?

15:31.194 --> 15:32.996
Hi, okay, I'm sorry, listen.

15:32.997 --> 15:35.401
I know that you're just doing your job.

15:35.402 --> 15:39.577
But the thing is, is that Noah is sick.

15:39.578 --> 15:41.413
I said he's sick.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.685
Um, he's still weak from the stabbing,

15:43.686 --> 15:46.390
and his doctor says that he needs to rest.

15:46.391 --> 15:49.062
And, if he can just
stay here for a day or two,

15:49.063 --> 15:52.569
I-I know he'll feel better,
so I was wondering if, um,

15:52.570 --> 15:55.543
I could bring him in on Monday?

15:57.981 --> 15:59.315
Great. Thank you.

15:59.316 --> 16:00.552
Thank you so much.

16:00.553 --> 16:01.754
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

16:01.755 --> 16:03.223
Hey! Hi.

16:03.224 --> 16:04.392
Is Dad's tent still downstairs?

16:04.393 --> 16:05.829
No, stop. Hey, stop!

16:05.830 --> 16:07.566
- You can't go down there.
- Why not?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.068
Because there's plumbers down there

16:09.069 --> 16:10.939
working on the sink.

16:10.940 --> 16:12.743
- So? I'm gonna look for it.
- It's gone!

16:12.744 --> 16:15.348
Whitney, it's gone. Dad took it years ago.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.056
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:20.626 --> 16:22.195
What do you need a tent for, anyway?

16:22.196 --> 16:23.865
What are you, like, camping?

16:23.866 --> 16:26.136
Yeah, actually, Furkat
and I are going upstate.

16:26.137 --> 16:27.806
Furkat camps?

16:27.807 --> 16:29.242
Why is that funny?

16:29.243 --> 16:31.814
I'm not sure. But it is.

16:31.815 --> 16:34.085
His daughter's band is in some festival,

16:34.086 --> 16:35.722
so we're gonna go see her play.

16:35.723 --> 16:37.793
- His daughter?
- Juniper.

16:37.794 --> 16:39.597
She's super talented.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.001
How old is Juniper?

16:42.002 --> 16:46.109
- Twenty-four.
- So two years older than you.

16:46.110 --> 16:48.681
I don't know, don't you think
you might have mentioned that?

16:48.682 --> 16:50.585
I mean, why wouldn't you tell me?

16:50.586 --> 16:52.355
<i>Where the fuck do you
think you're going?</i>

16:56.130 --> 16:57.498
What the fuck is wrong with you?

16:57.499 --> 16:59.503
- What the hell?
- Is that Dad?

16:59.504 --> 17:00.872
- Fuck!
- Christ!

17:00.873 --> 17:02.408
- What are you doing?
- Stop, get off!

17:02.409 --> 17:03.878
- Get off of him! Get off!
- What are you doing?

17:03.879 --> 17:04.946
What is wrong with you?

17:04.948 --> 17:06.249
What is wrong with me?

17:06.250 --> 17:08.053
Your fucking dad just attacked me!

17:08.054 --> 17:09.656
Whitney, get inside. You, get out of here.

17:09.657 --> 17:11.226
Look, Helen, with all due respect,

17:11.227 --> 17:12.261
I barely touched him.

17:12.262 --> 17:13.565
You're a fucking maniac!

17:13.566 --> 17:15.067
Get out of here before I call the cops.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.503
- Mom, easy.
- No, no, no.

17:16.505 --> 17:18.608
It's fine. I'll just go hit REI.

17:18.608 --> 17:21.079
Whatever. Don't worry.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.416
I'll speak to you later,
bunny. You... you asked for it.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.987
Let me see.

17:24.988 --> 17:26.757
Can you hear me?

17:26.758 --> 17:28.928
Noah?

17:28.929 --> 17:30.932
Helen.

17:30.933 --> 17:33.036
Okay, you're okay. Come on.

17:33.037 --> 17:35.040
- Helen.
- What is he doing here?

17:35.041 --> 17:37.011
Whitney, inside, please. I'll
be there in a few minutes.

17:37.012 --> 17:39.315
Please!

17:41.454 --> 17:43.358
Okay, right here, this way.

17:49.804 --> 17:51.006
What the fuck?

17:51.007 --> 17:53.010
Noah, what the fuck?

17:53.011 --> 17:55.180
What did you say to him?

17:55.181 --> 17:56.651
Nothing.

17:56.652 --> 17:59.422
Nothing? He just came after you like that?

17:59.423 --> 18:00.892
What?

18:00.893 --> 18:02.596
And why did you let him keep hitting you?

18:02.597 --> 18:04.933
Why didn't you fight back?

18:04.934 --> 18:07.271
I don't know.

18:07.272 --> 18:09.175
<i>Mom, I'm getting the
fuck out of here!</i>

18:09.176 --> 18:10.444
Shit. All right, wait!

18:10.445 --> 18:11.882
I'll be right back.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.995
Whitney! Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

18:18.996 --> 18:22.468
I'm sorry. I just had
to make sure he was okay.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.506
- How long has he been here?
- Since this morning.

18:24.507 --> 18:26.510
But can you just come inside and talk?

18:26.511 --> 18:28.180
We'll just sit down and we'll
talk about it, all right?

18:28.181 --> 18:29.750
- Please?
- I'm not staying.

18:29.751 --> 18:31.219
- No, Whit...
- I can't be in this house.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.190
Not with him here. Don't you see that?

18:33.191 --> 18:34.860
He's downstairs, he's not
gonna come up here, all right?

18:34.861 --> 18:36.396
- My God. Good-bye!
- Sweetheart, please just...

18:36.397 --> 18:37.766
- Please, no, you may not leave.
- Don't touch me!

18:37.767 --> 18:38.935
Whitney, you can't go with that man!

18:38.936 --> 18:40.772
He attacked your father.

18:40.773 --> 18:43.343
- He was defending me.
- You were inside!

18:43.344 --> 18:46.182
I don't know what the
hell you think you saw,

18:46.183 --> 18:48.120
but he was not defending you.

18:48.121 --> 18:50.959
He-he... This has to end right now.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.896
He's twice your age and he's using you.

18:52.897 --> 18:55.100
You have no fucking idea
what you're talking about!

18:55.101 --> 18:58.641
Yes, I do! How many assistants
do you think he's gone through?

18:58.642 --> 19:00.812
How many girls do you
think he's gone through?

19:00.813 --> 19:04.753
- Furkat cares about me!
- Lord.

19:04.754 --> 19:07.224
He's the only one who cares.

19:07.225 --> 19:10.264
He went after Dad because he
knows what Dad's done to me.

19:10.265 --> 19:12.502
<i>Done to you?</i>

19:12.503 --> 19:14.840
You live in a fucking fantasy world, Mom.

19:14.841 --> 19:17.378
I'm sorry. I don't know
what to do about it anymore.

19:17.379 --> 19:19.182
You can't see anything that's happening!

19:19.183 --> 19:21.252
You're obviously too upset to
have an adult conversation...

19:21.253 --> 19:23.558
You let Dad back in this house!

19:23.559 --> 19:24.626
Shh! Lower your voice!

19:24.627 --> 19:26.463
He's right down there.

19:32.810 --> 19:35.783
What do you think is gonna happen now, Mom?

19:37.954 --> 19:41.660
What, we just go back to
being some happy family?

19:41.661 --> 19:45.134
We forget everything that Dad did to us?

19:51.748 --> 19:54.587
Why do you hate yourself so much?

19:58.427 --> 20:00.699
I don't.

20:05.041 --> 20:09.215
You know, I used to think
that Dad was the crazy one.

20:10.485 --> 20:12.523
Now I realize it's you.

20:14.359 --> 20:15.962
Whitney, Whitney, Whitney.

20:15.963 --> 20:18.634
Please tell me where you're going.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.638
I have no idea.

21:38.127 --> 21:39.564
<i>Mom!</i>

21:42.503 --> 21:45.440
<i>Mom, are you home?</i>

21:45.441 --> 21:47.513
<i>What's for dinner? I'm starving!</i>

21:57.633 --> 21:59.936
<i>It's Jane Eyre, but it's a musical.</i>

22:01.039 --> 22:02.307
I mean, I'm only in the chorus,

22:02.308 --> 22:04.111
but you've read the book, right?

22:04.112 --> 22:05.982
Yeah, I did, a long time ago.

22:05.983 --> 22:08.554
The book's super intense. I
started reading last night.

22:08.555 --> 22:11.392
- I've got, like, 30 pages left.
- Wow, that's fast.

22:11.393 --> 22:13.463
Hey.

22:13.464 --> 22:15.133
- Hey.
- Hi, Vik.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.070
Hey, guess what I'm doing at school.

22:17.071 --> 22:19.776
- What?
- Take this to the table.

22:19.777 --> 22:21.145
Dinner's basically ready.

22:21.146 --> 22:23.416
Great, I'm hungry. Hey, kids.

22:23.417 --> 22:25.287
- We're having spaghetti.
- Yeah?

22:25.288 --> 22:26.924
And Trevor's doing some musical,

22:26.925 --> 22:28.694
even though he can't sing.

22:28.695 --> 22:30.531
- I can sing.
- No, you can't.

22:30.532 --> 22:32.334
How's downstairs?

22:32.335 --> 22:33.938
It's fine.

22:33.939 --> 22:36.442
- All taken care of?
- Yup.

22:36.443 --> 22:37.679
Well, you can't sing at all,

22:37.680 --> 22:39.983
so just don't talk, okay?

22:39.984 --> 22:42.956
It's almost like she switches genres.

22:42.957 --> 22:44.726
First, you think it's a romance,

22:44.727 --> 22:46.495
but then it turns into a thriller.

22:46.496 --> 22:48.634
- Very sneaky.
- I know!

22:48.635 --> 22:50.504
Rochester's all in love with
Jane, but the whole time,

22:50.505 --> 22:53.009
he's got this wife, this crazy lady,

22:53.010 --> 22:56.148
hiding up in the attic.

22:56.149 --> 22:57.752
What was that?

22:57.753 --> 22:59.823
- It's Bertha!
- Who's Bertha?

22:59.824 --> 23:01.392
She's the crazy lady in the attic.

23:01.393 --> 23:03.429
You know, in the story.

23:03.430 --> 23:04.766
My musical?

23:04.767 --> 23:08.206
There's plumbers working downstairs.

23:08.207 --> 23:09.876
They must've dropped something.

23:09.877 --> 23:11.446
You think?

23:15.789 --> 23:18.027
I'm sure it's fine.

23:27.412 --> 23:31.352
I think I'm finished.

23:31.353 --> 23:32.355
Excuse me.

23:37.398 --> 23:39.002
Is he okay?

23:41.373 --> 23:43.343
Can you guys go to your rooms?

23:43.344 --> 23:45.614
- What?
- It's eight o'clock.

23:45.615 --> 23:47.117
Yeah, I know. I just need a minute.

23:47.118 --> 23:50.057
Can I have one minute? One minute alone?

23:51.059 --> 23:52.528
Please?

23:52.529 --> 23:54.199
Go!

24:18.280 --> 24:19.784
Please don't.

24:23.792 --> 24:25.628
Can we please talk about this?

24:25.629 --> 24:27.932
There is nothing to talk about.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.036
You lied to me, repeatedly.

24:30.037 --> 24:32.474
I know I did.

24:32.475 --> 24:34.378
You lied when I moved up here

24:34.379 --> 24:36.081
and you said you were done with him.

24:36.082 --> 24:39.087
You lied this morning
when you said he'd be gone.

24:39.088 --> 24:42.093
You lied at dinner when
you said he was gone.

24:42.094 --> 24:43.997
And not just to me, to your children.

24:43.998 --> 24:46.268
I know. It was wrong. But I can fix it.

24:46.269 --> 24:48.607
I promise.

24:48.608 --> 24:50.578
I'll tell him to leave right now.

24:50.579 --> 24:51.780
Yeah? And then what?

24:51.781 --> 24:52.781
Fuck!

24:58.427 --> 25:01.198
You can do what you want, Helen.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.737
Because I get how this goes.

25:03.738 --> 25:05.273
He leaves now,

25:05.274 --> 25:06.810
and then the next time,

25:06.811 --> 25:10.283
three months later or
three years or tomorrow,

25:10.284 --> 25:11.953
whenever he shows up with his bullshit,

25:11.954 --> 25:15.493
you let him right back fucking in.

25:15.494 --> 25:19.602
I mean, I-I really don't understand it.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.606
I have tried.

25:21.607 --> 25:24.579
But I don't.

25:24.580 --> 25:27.417
The only explanation is
that you still love him.

25:27.418 --> 25:29.756
No.

25:29.757 --> 25:31.259
That's not true.

25:35.936 --> 25:37.773
Vik.

25:38.808 --> 25:40.711
Wait, Vik.

25:40.712 --> 25:41.980
Please wait.

25:41.981 --> 25:44.686
I have waited.

25:44.687 --> 25:46.990
I'm not always a nice person, Helen.

25:46.991 --> 25:48.794
I don't even know if I'm a good person.

25:48.795 --> 25:50.664
But I am fucking honest.

25:50.665 --> 25:52.702
And I don't know how to
live with someone who isn't.

25:52.703 --> 25:54.505
- Okay, please, just please...
- Just tell me the truth.

25:54.506 --> 25:56.241
For once.

25:56.242 --> 25:58.346
Are you still in love with him?

25:58.347 --> 26:00.016
No.

26:00.017 --> 26:02.153
Then what is it?

26:02.154 --> 26:05.027
Why can't you just let him go?

26:15.180 --> 26:17.118
I'll miss the kids.

26:30.477 --> 26:31.514
Is he gone?

26:35.254 --> 26:36.823
Someone just left. I heard the door.

26:36.824 --> 26:39.394
It was Vik.

26:39.395 --> 26:41.032
It was Vik?

26:43.236 --> 26:45.542
We're done. He's not coming back.

26:59.268 --> 27:01.406
It wasn't because of me, was it?

27:06.382 --> 27:08.153
Was it because of me?

27:34.238 --> 27:35.741
Are you crying?

27:35.742 --> 27:37.979
It's okay.

27:38.981 --> 27:41.619
Helen, I'm sorry.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.255
I'm gonna go. I shouldn't be here.

27:43.256 --> 27:45.562
Why are you doing this to yourself?

27:48.433 --> 27:50.236
What? Why am I doing what?

27:50.237 --> 27:53.276
You-you're destroying yourself,
and I need you to stop.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.986
You need me to stop what, exactly?

27:59.756 --> 28:02.427
You went to prison.

28:02.428 --> 28:04.130
And you were beaten in prison,

28:04.131 --> 28:06.235
and you wouldn't let me help you.

28:06.236 --> 28:09.040
And you're violating your parole,

28:09.041 --> 28:10.811
and you're taking too many pills,

28:10.812 --> 28:13.917
and you're letting people
kick the shit out of you.

28:13.918 --> 28:15.721
We both know what you're doing.

28:15.722 --> 28:17.791
You need to stop punishing yourself.

28:20.397 --> 28:23.069
I-I forgive you.

28:25.107 --> 28:26.409
You what?

28:29.482 --> 28:31.520
I forgive you.

28:32.822 --> 28:34.491
<i>You forgive me?</i>

28:34.492 --> 28:36.095
I do.

28:47.284 --> 28:49.387
What if...

28:49.388 --> 28:52.493
what if...

28:52.494 --> 28:53.898
what if we could...

28:56.737 --> 28:59.909
Start over, just erase everything?

28:59.910 --> 29:01.479
Helen.

29:25.561 --> 29:28.065
Wait. Hey.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.336
Just come.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.250
What?

30:12.922 --> 30:14.291
What?

30:41.112 --> 30:43.015
- Okay, pull in over there.
- What?

30:43.016 --> 30:44.818
- Over there.
- "Hunting & Fishing"?

30:44.819 --> 30:46.657
- Right now, stop the car.
- Okay, fine.

31:06.126 --> 31:08.126
_

31:17.484 --> 31:18.620
Good morning.

31:18.621 --> 31:20.189
Morning.

31:20.190 --> 31:23.395
Anything in particular I can help you with?

31:23.396 --> 31:25.467
No, thank you.

31:40.497 --> 31:44.070
Are you sure I can't
help you find something?

31:44.071 --> 31:45.775
No, I'm good. Thank you.

32:10.758 --> 32:12.059
Will this be all?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.664
Yeah.

32:20.878 --> 32:22.714
Are you,

32:22.715 --> 32:24.051
John's mother?

32:26.088 --> 32:28.392
Yes, I am. Johnny is my oldest.

32:28.393 --> 32:29.928
I knew him back in high school.

32:29.929 --> 32:31.364
Used to swim against him.

32:31.365 --> 32:32.934
Really?

32:32.935 --> 32:34.203
Is he around?

32:34.204 --> 32:36.274
Johnny? Here?

32:36.275 --> 32:38.646
Does he ever come by?

32:38.647 --> 32:40.249
I'd like to see him again.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.621
That makes two of us.

32:42.622 --> 32:44.825
Well, he-he gets down when he can.

32:44.826 --> 32:47.296
It's not a quick trip.
He's up near Fishkill.

32:47.297 --> 32:49.434
In New York?

32:49.435 --> 32:51.404
Like, near the... near the prison?

32:51.405 --> 32:52.574
He's a guard.

32:52.575 --> 32:55.279
- Yeah?
- Twenty years.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.484
- Not easy.
- I bet.

33:00.156 --> 33:01.960
Does he live right there?

33:04.097 --> 33:06.367
- Sorry?
- Does he live right near work?

33:06.368 --> 33:08.205
No-no big commute or...

33:08.206 --> 33:09.608
Well, it used to be shorter.

33:09.609 --> 33:11.478
They just moved over to Hughsonville.

33:11.479 --> 33:15.152
His wife got a job at a
little hair salon there.

33:15.153 --> 33:16.555
His wife?

33:16.556 --> 33:18.659
- So he's married?
- 16 years.

33:18.660 --> 33:21.397
Sweet girl, Kaylee.

33:21.398 --> 33:23.769
I used to hope they'd move home.

33:23.770 --> 33:26.407
But that is not gonna happen.

33:26.408 --> 33:28.813
Johnny always was itching
to get out of town,

33:28.814 --> 33:31.017
even when he was young.

33:31.018 --> 33:33.321
- His loss, then.
- That's the truth.

33:35.093 --> 33:36.762
Well, anyway, Noah Solloway,

33:36.763 --> 33:39.166
I'm gonna tell Johnny that you stopped by.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.603
He'll be glad to hear that.

33:40.604 --> 33:41.639
Yeah, please.

33:41.640 --> 33:44.343
Tell him I send my best.

33:44.344 --> 33:46.381
Have some homemade beef jerky.

33:46.382 --> 33:48.151
It's on the house.

33:48.152 --> 33:49.821
Thank you.

33:49.822 --> 33:51.191
Looks delicious.

33:52.962 --> 33:54.131
You take care.

34:02.080 --> 34:03.583
You're back.

34:03.584 --> 34:05.587
Starting to think you ran away.

34:05.588 --> 34:07.456
Yeah, well, I'm back.

34:07.457 --> 34:09.328
What did you need so badly?

34:12.835 --> 34:14.771
Want some?

34:14.772 --> 34:16.342
No, thank you.

34:18.045 --> 34:20.717
Can you put your seat belt on, please?

34:25.393 --> 34:27.563
Fucking...

34:27.565 --> 34:29.735
You should really get that checked out.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.744
I'm fine.

34:36.014 --> 34:38.217
Well, you're clearly not,
because if this is fine...

34:38.219 --> 34:39.888
Helen, I just need to sleep.

34:39.889 --> 34:41.492
Is that okay with you?

34:43.362 --> 34:44.766
Go ahead.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.754
God, help me.

35:08.379 --> 35:10.850
<i>Who the fuck got my meds, man?</i>

35:10.851 --> 35:14.056
<i>I need my motherfucking meds, bitch!</i>

35:17.497 --> 35:18.899
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

35:18.900 --> 35:20.202
<i>No, fuck you, bitch!</i>

35:20.203 --> 35:21.905
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

35:27.217 --> 35:29.522
<i>I can't find my cell phone!</i>

35:32.360 --> 35:35.365
<i>Did you take my cell phone?</i>

35:36.770 --> 35:38.739
<i>Mom, Stacey hid my phone!</i>

35:38.740 --> 35:41.713
<i>I didn't hide it. Look downstairs.</i>

35:52.500 --> 35:54.069
You're up.

35:54.070 --> 35:55.840
Yeah, I was just leaving.

35:55.841 --> 35:57.844
- Ha, very funny.
- No, I have to.

35:57.845 --> 36:01.184
The kids could come down.
And they shouldn't see me.

36:01.185 --> 36:02.788
The kids?

36:04.391 --> 36:06.260
Also, I don't belong here, Helen.

36:06.261 --> 36:07.421
You've been very nice, but...

36:10.469 --> 36:12.574
You can't go anywhere, not like that.

36:12.575 --> 36:14.744
Vik said he would take a
look at you before work.

36:14.745 --> 36:16.314
That's not necessary, thanks.

36:16.315 --> 36:18.251
I'm happy to leave if you want me to.

36:18.252 --> 36:19.955
He doesn't.

36:19.956 --> 36:23.762
You don't.

36:23.763 --> 36:25.566
What am I looking at, his neck?

36:25.567 --> 36:27.102
I'm sure it's infected.

36:27.103 --> 36:28.739
He clearly hasn't been taking care of it,

36:28.740 --> 36:30.342
and he went into that filthy water.

36:30.343 --> 36:31.845
It's not my neck.

36:31.846 --> 36:33.916
It's-it's my damn shoulder, and...

36:35.319 --> 36:37.322
Noah, what's going on?

36:37.323 --> 36:39.661
W-would you mind writing me a prescription

36:39.662 --> 36:41.999
for some painkillers, please?

36:42.000 --> 36:43.503
Why would I do that?

36:45.139 --> 36:47.810
This thing happened
to me in prison, and...

36:47.811 --> 36:50.783
A "thing" happened to you?

36:50.784 --> 36:52.486
He broke his shoulder.

36:52.487 --> 36:53.722
That can hurt.

36:53.723 --> 36:55.392
It-it shattered
in-in three places,

36:55.393 --> 36:57.029
and all they did was give me Vicodin,

36:57.030 --> 37:00.068
and if I take ten a day,
I can deal with it mainly,

37:00.069 --> 37:01.838
but, um...

37:01.839 --> 37:05.445
I-I just... I took my
last one, and now I...

37:05.446 --> 37:07.249
You're taking ten Vicodin a day?

37:07.250 --> 37:09.186
That's a disaster.

37:09.187 --> 37:10.656
I might have some Tylenol with Codeine

37:10.657 --> 37:12.927
left over from when Trev broke his ankle.

37:12.928 --> 37:15.866
- I'll take a look for it.
- He can have two, max.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.871
Check his neck.

37:24.518 --> 37:27.323
Look, I know you don't
like me very much, but...

37:29.227 --> 37:31.030
Can I ask you, if an infection like this

37:31.031 --> 37:33.902
gets really bad, can it...

37:33.903 --> 37:35.539
can it cause hallucinations?

37:35.540 --> 37:37.309
Get out.

37:37.310 --> 37:38.144
What?

37:38.145 --> 37:39.914
I mean it.

37:39.915 --> 37:42.252
I'll write you your goddamn prescription,

37:42.253 --> 37:44.089
and then I want you out of this house

37:44.090 --> 37:47.397
before I call the police to
take you back to fuckin' prison.

37:49.568 --> 37:51.538
Look, I think th-there may
be some misunderstanding.

37:51.539 --> 37:53.107
If you're worried about me and Helen...

37:53.108 --> 37:55.178
Your wound's infected.

37:55.179 --> 37:57.884
And you're addicted to opioids.

37:57.885 --> 37:59.254
I'm not worried.

38:45.547 --> 38:46.882
Got drugs.

38:46.883 --> 38:48.986
Codeine and Ambien.

38:48.987 --> 38:50.156
Okay.

38:52.126 --> 38:53.962
No, not until you lie down.

38:53.963 --> 38:54.931
What?

38:54.932 --> 38:57.470
I mean it. It's bedtime.

38:58.740 --> 38:59.842
Let's go.

39:03.015 --> 39:04.349
Here you go.

39:04.350 --> 39:05.554
Thanks.

39:07.925 --> 39:10.730
- One extra-special Tylenol.
- Thank you.

39:12.233 --> 39:14.437
And one Ambien.

39:17.043 --> 39:18.546
My favorite.

39:20.282 --> 39:23.254
How 'bout another Tylenol?

39:23.255 --> 39:26.160
Will you talk to me?

39:26.161 --> 39:29.934
I want to know what's going on with you.

39:29.935 --> 39:33.307
You can tell me the truth. You know that.

39:33.308 --> 39:34.945
Right?

39:41.525 --> 39:43.361
- Fuck.
- You should answer that.

39:43.362 --> 39:45.498
- No, thanks.
- Just pick it up.

39:45.499 --> 39:47.269
It might be about your
case. He might have some...

39:47.270 --> 39:49.306
He's not a he. She's
my parole officer, okay?

39:49.307 --> 39:52.312
And no one knows anything about
my so-called case, all right?

39:52.313 --> 39:53.815
No one knows who tried to kill me.

39:53.816 --> 39:56.354
No one fucking cares what really happened.

39:58.458 --> 40:00.864
I'm on my own here, okay?

40:06.041 --> 40:08.311
Sorry.

40:08.312 --> 40:09.914
Sorry, I-I didn't mean to say all that.

40:09.915 --> 40:13.055
I just... I know you're
trying to help, and I...

40:19.735 --> 40:21.905
Here.

40:21.906 --> 40:23.576
Thanks.

40:29.087 --> 40:30.757
I'll see you when you wake up.

40:51.766 --> 40:53.603
<i>Solloway!</i>

40:55.807 --> 40:57.977
Hey! Solloway!

41:01.017 --> 41:02.452
How you doing?

41:02.453 --> 41:04.857
Look at that?

41:04.858 --> 41:07.763
Is that a burger or what?

41:18.418 --> 41:21.156
I like to take the fries

41:21.157 --> 41:23.394
and put 'em right inside,

41:23.395 --> 41:26.467
just like they do at Moody's Diner.

41:26.468 --> 41:28.972
Remember?

41:28.973 --> 41:31.176
It's, down on Route 11.

41:31.177 --> 41:32.412
You've been there before.

41:40.028 --> 41:41.832
Are you hungry?

41:43.502 --> 41:45.371
Thirsty. I need some water.

41:45.372 --> 41:48.277
You mean they didn't fix that thing yet?

41:48.278 --> 41:50.182
Damn it. That's...

42:03.676 --> 42:06.013
Yep, doesn't work.

42:10.155 --> 42:13.930
I'm gonna look into it, though, all right?

42:24.183 --> 42:26.354
Just, um, but first...

42:28.491 --> 42:30.394
I want to ask you a question,

42:30.395 --> 42:33.501
something that's just
been gnawing on my mind.

42:41.017 --> 42:42.921
What did you do?

42:45.727 --> 42:47.529
You know that.

42:47.530 --> 42:50.334
I ran over someone in my car.

42:50.335 --> 42:52.038
Where were you going that night?

42:52.039 --> 42:55.277
I mean, why-why were you driving?

42:55.278 --> 42:58.551
I was driving my ex-wife
home from a party.

42:58.552 --> 43:00.021
You had an affair.

43:00.022 --> 43:01.524
What?

43:01.525 --> 43:04.697
You had an affair. That's what happened.

43:04.698 --> 43:06.535
Wow.

43:08.038 --> 43:09.675
Sure.

43:11.344 --> 43:13.748
Sure.

43:13.749 --> 43:15.484
So why'd you have the affair?

43:15.485 --> 43:17.723
I mean, you had everything.

43:17.724 --> 43:20.494
You're, like, out of armpit Pennsylvania

43:20.495 --> 43:23.668
and you go straight into some fancy college

43:23.669 --> 43:25.872
and meet a hot chick.

43:25.873 --> 43:27.910
She's rich.

43:27.911 --> 43:30.448
Her daddy buys you a house.

43:30.449 --> 43:31.585
I mean, hell...

43:33.121 --> 43:35.525
Me? I-I'd kill

43:35.526 --> 43:39.467
just to live that life for a day.

43:42.139 --> 43:44.110
But here you are.

43:46.481 --> 43:48.484
With me.

43:48.485 --> 43:50.656
Could I just have some water, please?

43:52.292 --> 43:53.762
It's funny,

43:53.763 --> 43:55.264
'cause when we were in high school,

43:55.265 --> 43:57.937
I was jealous of you.

43:59.808 --> 44:01.443
Not anymore.

44:01.444 --> 44:03.013
I mean, look at you, you know?

44:03.014 --> 44:06.621
You...

44:06.622 --> 44:08.423
You're no better than me.

44:08.424 --> 44:11.899
In a lot of ways, you're even worse off.

44:13.201 --> 44:15.540
Don't you think so?

44:19.280 --> 44:20.817
Answer me.

44:24.089 --> 44:25.392
Answer me.

44:27.095 --> 44:28.898
Motherfucker!

44:28.899 --> 44:30.000
What'd you say?

44:32.272 --> 44:34.610
Come on.

44:34.611 --> 44:36.146
Admit it.

44:36.147 --> 44:38.986
You think I'm doing better than you.

44:40.623 --> 44:42.158
No, I don't.

44:42.159 --> 44:43.427
Why not?

44:43.428 --> 44:44.930
'Cause I'm getting out of here

44:44.931 --> 44:46.701
in six months, and you're stuck here

44:46.702 --> 44:48.873
for the rest of your fucking life.

44:50.475 --> 44:51.944
Really? You think you're just

44:51.945 --> 44:53.648
gonna walk out of here and forget about me?

44:53.649 --> 44:55.451
Well, I'm gonna make a point to make sure

44:55.452 --> 44:57.488
that that does not fucking happen.

45:04.571 --> 45:07.743
Hey! Hey, hey, whoa! That's assault!

45:07.744 --> 45:10.481
And that just earned you
another 90 days in the hole.

45:10.482 --> 45:12.786
- No, please, John.
- Right here.

45:12.787 --> 45:14.657
- Take a good look.
- John!

45:14.658 --> 45:16.761
Please, John.

45:16.762 --> 45:18.363
- It's Gunther.
- Please!

45:18.364 --> 45:20.869
John, please!

45:25.211 --> 45:27.215
<i>You're not coming in?</i>

45:29.788 --> 45:32.526
<i>What are you, scared?</i>

45:32.527 --> 45:34.028
<i>You are!</i>

45:34.029 --> 45:35.666
<i>My God, you're terrified.</i>

45:46.855 --> 45:48.324
Looking for someone?

45:51.197 --> 45:53.768
Yeah.

45:53.769 --> 45:55.605
Thought I heard my daughter.

45:55.606 --> 45:58.443
So you're Noah.

45:58.444 --> 46:00.080
I thought you might be.

46:00.081 --> 46:02.854
Do I know you?

46:05.458 --> 46:06.728
Whitney went in.

46:08.799 --> 46:10.702
No, no, no.

46:10.703 --> 46:13.473
She doesn't want to see you, buddy.

46:13.474 --> 46:15.244
What are you talking about?

46:15.245 --> 46:18.851
- How would you know?
- 'Cause I'm her lover.

46:18.852 --> 46:21.857
- What?
- And her boss.

46:21.858 --> 46:24.062
Her lover-boss.

46:24.063 --> 46:25.431
What are you, 50?

46:25.432 --> 46:27.001
Maybe she does have some daddy issues,

46:27.002 --> 46:29.840
but that kind of, you know, tends to happen

46:29.841 --> 46:31.678
when your father's a scumbag.

46:33.047 --> 46:35.350
No. No, you fucking hold it.

46:35.351 --> 46:36.854
She tells me everything, Solloway.

46:36.855 --> 46:39.225
I know it all.

46:39.226 --> 46:40.728
The waitress.

46:40.729 --> 46:42.533
What?

46:45.573 --> 46:47.576
The publicist.

46:47.577 --> 46:49.312
The party.

46:49.313 --> 46:51.650
- Okay, I'm not listening...
- The fucking hot tub?

46:51.651 --> 46:53.654
What the fuck is wrong with you?

46:53.655 --> 46:55.257
- Dad?
- Whitney.

46:56.260 --> 46:58.231
Dad?

47:17.603 --> 47:19.305
<i>Hey, kids.</i>

47:19.306 --> 47:21.276
<i>We're having spaghetti.</i>

47:21.277 --> 47:22.879
<i>And Trevor's doing some musical...</i>

47:22.880 --> 47:24.750
<i>Even though he can't sing.</i>

47:24.751 --> 47:26.452
<i>- I can sing.
- No, you can't.</i>

47:26.453 --> 47:27.923
<i>You sound like an antelope.</i>

47:27.924 --> 47:29.091
<i>You don't even know</i>

47:29.092 --> 47:30.895
<i>what an antelope sounds like.</i>

47:30.896 --> 47:32.566
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

47:32.567 --> 47:34.268
<i>Well, you can't sing at all,</i>

47:34.269 --> 47:37.509
<i>so just don't talk, okay?</i>

48:52.860 --> 48:54.495
The door was open.

49:00.776 --> 49:02.045
What do you want?

49:27.195 --> 49:28.697
Nice.

49:28.698 --> 49:30.735
I don't know what it is
you fucking want, man.

49:30.736 --> 49:33.608
- That's not true.
- Just tell me what you want.

49:44.229 --> 49:45.866
I think you know what I want.

49:47.268 --> 49:49.305
You bought a knife

49:49.306 --> 49:51.443
from my poor mother, Noah.

49:53.715 --> 49:55.084
<i>What do you want?</i>

50:39.306 --> 50:41.977
You're not leaving, are you?

50:41.978 --> 50:44.014
Did you just see him? Is he gone?

50:44.015 --> 50:45.985
- See who?
- The man came through here.

50:45.986 --> 50:48.256
He... I heard him go.
I heard the door slam.

50:48.257 --> 50:50.193
- That was Vik.
- Vik?

50:51.831 --> 50:52.999
Yeah.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.071
He just left.

50:59.914 --> 51:01.750
Come on, sit down. I'll get you some water.

51:01.751 --> 51:03.186
You sure?

51:03.187 --> 51:05.156
Noah, are you okay?

51:05.157 --> 51:08.832
Because, honestly, you seem very confused.

51:11.571 --> 51:13.675
Forget the water. You need a drink.

51:38.625 --> 51:40.594
Here you go.

51:40.595 --> 51:42.699
And I have a few other treats for you.

51:44.870 --> 51:47.743
Augmentin, and what's this?

51:49.379 --> 51:50.915
Vicodin.

51:54.222 --> 51:55.257
Open up.

52:04.577 --> 52:06.379
Come on.

52:22.211 --> 52:25.416
Vik's not coming back.

52:25.417 --> 52:27.255
He left me for good.

52:29.159 --> 52:31.495
Was that... it wasn't because of me?

52:31.496 --> 52:34.002
Of course it was because of you.

52:36.106 --> 52:38.309
I mean, can I be honest?

52:38.310 --> 52:40.816
I wanted him to leave. I mean...

52:42.986 --> 52:46.025
Vik doesn't belong here.

52:46.026 --> 52:47.796
You belong here.

52:51.102 --> 52:55.544
You should let me help
you, Noah, because...

52:55.545 --> 52:58.784
I'm really the only one who can,
who knows the pain you're in.

52:58.785 --> 53:00.888
Here.

53:05.464 --> 53:06.968
Have another one.

53:25.839 --> 53:27.708
It's gonna be okay.

53:31.116 --> 53:32.853
It is.

53:34.489 --> 53:37.394
Listen, you've done some bad things.

53:37.395 --> 53:39.298
But we all make mistakes,

53:39.299 --> 53:41.168
and we don't deserve to be in this pain.

53:41.169 --> 53:42.738
You deserve to be happy,

53:42.739 --> 53:44.842
to be with people who love you.

53:47.649 --> 53:50.888
I know you.

53:50.889 --> 53:52.725
I know who you really are,

53:52.726 --> 53:54.729
and I forgive you.

54:16.640 --> 54:18.510
Wait.

54:18.511 --> 54:19.713
Come on.

54:57.923 --> 54:59.625
I know you.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.201
I know you.

55:08.376 --> 55:10.079
I know you.

55:17.629 --> 55:19.298
What?

55:23.440 --> 55:26.478
You don't know me.

55:26.479 --> 55:27.581
I do.

55:27.582 --> 55:28.885
You don't.

55:30.822 --> 55:32.223
- I do.
- You don't.

55:32.224 --> 55:34.662
I do. I do.

55:36.432 --> 55:37.768
No, you don't.

55:37.769 --> 55:38.637
I know you.

55:38.638 --> 55:40.273
You don't know me.

55:40.274 --> 55:42.243
- Yes, I do.
- You don't know me!

55:43.480 --> 55:45.183
You don't fuckin' know me.

55:45.184 --> 55:47.253
We're okay. We're okay.

55:47.254 --> 55:49.191
- We're okay.
- Don't know me.

55:49.192 --> 55:51.195
Wait. I like fucking you.

55:51.196 --> 55:52.197
You don't fucking...

55:53.768 --> 55:55.837
I know you.

55:55.838 --> 55:57.841
Hey. Wait.

55:58.778 --> 56:00.847
Noah, enough!
