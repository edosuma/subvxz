00:03.000 --> 00:04.583
Previously on MECH-X4...

00:04.667 --> 00:07.291
-Technopath test subjects?
-Like your birth parents?

00:07.375 --> 00:09.166
-I thought you were dead.
-Surprise.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.583
-Grey!
-(roaring)

00:11.667 --> 00:13.667
I did it. I cracked the data core, y'all.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.417
My birth parents are there.
Who are they?

00:15.500 --> 00:17.750
(Grey) Your red ooze drove people crazy

00:17.834 --> 00:20.834
and can be neutralized with freezing cold.

00:20.917 --> 00:23.583
Grey's back. What is she up to?
What does she want?

00:23.667 --> 00:26.333
They didn't know
that this was all I needed.

00:26.417 --> 00:27.959
I've been thinking about the visions.

00:28.041 --> 00:30.834
If it weren't for them,
we wouldn't have known about the monster.

00:30.917 --> 00:33.083
Someone out there is our ally.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.291
We have someone on our side.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.542
-I can fix it! I can fix it!
-Then do it!

00:36.625 --> 00:37.834
-And make more.
-What?

00:37.917 --> 00:40.125
It shouldn't take much
to enhance your powers.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.125
(Grey) Who said it was for me?

00:45.291 --> 00:46.583
-Is that him?
-No.

00:48.166 --> 00:49.834
-Okay, what about him?
-No.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.625
Ryan, your father didn't look
like a 40-year-old Al Roker.

00:52.709 --> 00:54.625
-That's good, right?
-Mmm...

00:55.083 --> 00:56.917
But you said his name was Randall Anthony.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.500
-Why can't we look for that?
-(sighs)

00:58.583 --> 01:01.709
I tried, but Harper never knew
your birth father's real name,

01:01.792 --> 01:04.458
so we'll just have to go through
each volunteer one at a time.

01:05.542 --> 01:09.375
-And you didn't know my mom, huh?
-Your father's the one who gave you to me.

01:09.458 --> 01:12.166
He never told me who she was
in case Harper captured me.

01:12.250 --> 01:13.667
You know?

01:13.750 --> 01:16.166
Like when he held you
in an underwater prison for years?

01:16.250 --> 01:18.625
I still can't take a bath
without flashbacks, Ryan.

01:19.792 --> 01:20.834
And I'm a bath guy.

01:20.917 --> 01:21.959
Hmm.

01:22.709 --> 01:25.834
Wait, that's him.
That's your father! Go back, go back.

01:25.917 --> 01:29.166
-Ha!
-(Ryan) "Subject 240."

01:29.250 --> 01:31.208
-Or "Randy," to his friends.
-(laughs)

01:31.291 --> 01:32.959
And always with that infectious smile.

01:35.375 --> 01:37.291
-That's my father.
-Yeah, yeah.

01:37.375 --> 01:38.875
I wondered if we looked alike.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.875
Let's see.

01:43.208 --> 01:47.583
Looks like Harper really spent
a lot of resources tracking him down.

01:47.667 --> 01:49.792
The last thing he had
on your birth father was,

01:49.875 --> 01:53.959
he was living under the alias
"Tony Ward" in Bogota, Colombia,

01:54.041 --> 01:55.583
five years ago,
then he lost him again.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.417
Wait, he changed his name?

01:57.500 --> 01:59.583
Yeah, to throw Harper off we all had to.

01:59.667 --> 02:02.750
For three years,
I was Doctor Max Flatiron.

02:02.834 --> 02:04.583
Science was his trade,

02:04.667 --> 02:06.542
passion was his game.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.583
Yeah. Oh! Oh, and when I lived in England,

02:08.667 --> 02:10.583
I was Penry Heathcoate.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.834
He liked Scottish eggs, tea,

02:12.917 --> 02:14.500
and living hard.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.917
Penry!

02:16.625 --> 02:18.458
Um... okay.

02:19.041 --> 02:21.834
So, what do we do now?

02:21.917 --> 02:25.667
Oh, well, now that I have
your birth father's last alias,

02:25.750 --> 02:27.667
I'm sure I can pick up
the trail again. Yeah.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.166
-Thank you, Leo.
-Mmm.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.834
With Harper gone...

02:31.417 --> 02:33.417
he doesn't have to hide any more.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.166
He-- he's free to...

02:36.000 --> 02:37.375
I mean,

02:37.458 --> 02:39.000
if he wants to...

02:40.000 --> 02:42.125
-he can...
-Meet his son?

02:43.709 --> 02:44.792
Yeah.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.000
It's been so long.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.750
Maybe he doesn't even remember me.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.834
He gave up everything

02:52.917 --> 02:54.333
so you'd be safe.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.333
I'm sure you're in his thoughts every day.

02:57.417 --> 02:58.458
Okay.

02:58.542 --> 03:00.583
Be right back, one minute.
We got him! Whoo!

03:00.667 --> 03:02.834
-(laughs)
-All right!

03:07.125 --> 03:08.917
(energy humming)

03:09.000 --> 03:10.625
(Ryan) You!

03:10.709 --> 03:12.417
(distorted voice)

03:17.000 --> 03:18.542
Harper?

03:21.041 --> 03:22.750
(theme music plays)

03:56.291 --> 03:58.375
(Harris) You need to increase
your rate of velocity.

03:58.458 --> 04:01.375
Also, you need more acceleration
to be able to jump over the school.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.375
What if I lost some weight?
Or wore a less puffy vest? How about that?

04:04.458 --> 04:06.417
What up, Justin Timber-flake?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.417
Wow! Never gets old.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.208
Wait, is that Spyder
jumping the school on a bike?

04:11.291 --> 04:13.250
-With a rocket?
-I have dreams.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.917
They're stupid. They're still my dreams.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
Well, it looks like you may need
to increase your angle of departure.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.792
-You know what I mean?
-So many big words.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.625
She's saying build a ramp.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.458
An effective but primitive solution.

04:25.542 --> 04:28.291
-But it is too dangerous.
-Which is why I'm going to do it.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.542
BTW, the weather
is supposed to be clear on Saturday,

04:31.625 --> 04:33.500
so, if you try it, let me know.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.333
-Most def, V.
-"Most def, V"?

04:36.417 --> 04:37.959
I can't believe
she asked me on a date.

04:38.041 --> 04:40.125
It's not a date.
She wants to see if you don't die!

04:40.208 --> 04:41.959
That's what a date is, right?

04:42.041 --> 04:46.542
Hey, guys. I'm pretty sure
I saw Harper in the robot,

04:46.625 --> 04:48.250
but when I attacked, he disappeared.

04:49.375 --> 04:51.542
-You know what this means, right?
-Yes, ghosts.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.333
Stress.

04:53.417 --> 04:55.959
Um, Spyder, you know
there's no such thing as ghosts, right?

04:56.041 --> 04:58.208
Then explain to me
why I keep seeing my grandfather.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.083
Because he's alive!

05:00.166 --> 05:01.792
Ryan, Harper is gone.

05:01.875 --> 05:03.583
You're stressed out
now that Grey is back.

05:03.667 --> 05:06.083
-I guess.
-You need to relax.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.500
Last time you were this tense,
you got some skate time in.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.583
And we almost got
assassinated in the woods.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.250
There's a skate club
that meets after school.

05:14.333 --> 05:16.792
You guys are probably right,
and it feels like forever

05:16.875 --> 05:18.625
since I've been on my board just for fun.

05:18.709 --> 05:20.083
And we're always here to hang out.

05:20.166 --> 05:22.208
Except for Saturday.
I've got a date with Veracity.

05:22.291 --> 05:24.875
Excuse me, does anybody know
how aftershave works?

05:24.959 --> 05:26.542
It's not a date!

05:26.625 --> 05:27.917
Yeah.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.375
Hey, Ry. You finally made it.

05:38.417 --> 05:40.000
Yeah, I've been meaning
to hang out,

05:40.083 --> 05:41.792
but I got caught up
in community service.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.875
I read to elderly dogs.

05:43.959 --> 05:46.291
That's... so weird.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.709
(clears throat)

05:48.500 --> 05:50.625
-(skateboard clatters)
-(boy) Ah! Oww!

05:50.709 --> 05:52.375
So, uh, what have you been up to?

05:52.458 --> 05:55.750
Oh, uh, trying to master
an air over the pyramid.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.250
Let me show you how it's done.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.458
If I land it, you owe me a smoothie.

06:04.542 --> 06:05.709
Deal.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.333
-(distorted voice)
-Ahh!

06:20.375 --> 06:21.333
(groans)

06:22.250 --> 06:25.625
I'll take a banana swirl
and some stitches.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.792
Okay. The hallucinations
aren't going away.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.500
-(laughs) Yeah, we heard.
-Wait, what do you mean, you heard?

06:39.583 --> 06:41.750
Dude, you wipe out that hard,
people are gonna talk.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.709
And text, and video chat,

06:43.792 --> 06:45.500
and post in online.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.125
-Yeah, most of them were me.
-Yeah.

06:47.208 --> 06:49.250
(phone chimes) Hee hee. Veracity.

06:49.333 --> 06:51.375
No, I'm not gonna shave my hair

06:51.458 --> 06:53.041
to be more aerodynamic.

06:53.125 --> 06:55.291
Gotta keep my man mane for our date.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.166
It's not a date.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.041
Okay, I know
you and Veracity compete a lot,

07:00.125 --> 07:01.792
but there's plenty of Spyder to go around.

07:01.875 --> 07:03.625
-Eww. No.
-Don't ever say that again.

07:04.083 --> 07:06.458
Okay, why do I keep
seeing Harper? Am I losing it?

07:07.166 --> 07:10.458
No. The technopathic part of your brain
is being stimulated.

07:10.542 --> 07:11.875
It matches the scans that I took

07:11.959 --> 07:13.917
after you had those flashes
of the sea monster.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.625
So, you're saying that these
are technopathic visions?

07:17.709 --> 07:19.333
But why is Harper there?

07:19.917 --> 07:21.208
Unless...

07:21.291 --> 07:23.208
Harper is alive!

07:24.959 --> 07:26.542
Oh, okay.
You need to take it easy.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.250
-You don't even know--
-No, these visions have been right so far.

07:29.333 --> 07:31.250
It must be him sending them.

07:31.333 --> 07:33.083
Why would the guy
who creates monsters

07:33.166 --> 07:34.333
warn us about monsters?

07:34.417 --> 07:37.000
I don't know.
I'll ask him when I put him in a box!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.917
Okay, you mean a prison.

07:41.542 --> 07:42.667
Yeah.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.792
(electricity crackling)

07:44.625 --> 07:46.000
Okay, dude, you need to calm down.

07:46.083 --> 07:48.208
Before you burn every gadget
we have in this room.

07:48.291 --> 07:49.542
Okay.

07:51.250 --> 07:52.625
Tell me more about these visions.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.750
It looks like he's trying to talk.

07:55.834 --> 07:58.542
Last time your brains
were connected like this,

07:58.625 --> 08:00.583
we were using a neurosplicer.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.125
Hmm.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.625
(distorted) Neuro-- neuro-splicer.

08:05.709 --> 08:07.458
He's trying to say "neurosplicer"!

08:07.542 --> 08:09.250
Okay, I can work with that!

08:09.333 --> 08:11.333
(Mark) Are you sure about this, Nerdo?

08:11.417 --> 08:13.458
I'm betting Harper's device
isn't strong enough

08:13.542 --> 08:15.166
to send his entire message.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.333
That's why he's saying "neurosplicer."

08:17.417 --> 08:19.834
With this, we can turn
Ryan's brain into an antenna,

08:19.917 --> 08:21.625
and get the whole message.

08:21.709 --> 08:23.125
Is he here right now?

08:23.208 --> 08:25.667
Yeah, that jerk's standing
right in front of me.

08:28.625 --> 08:30.750
Yeah, but the last time
Ryan used this thing,

08:30.834 --> 08:32.041
he almost got brain damage.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.500
Theoretically, it could wipe
Ryan's brain

08:34.583 --> 08:36.125
and turn him into a mindless drone...

08:38.792 --> 08:41.208
uh, but I'm... going to be...

08:41.291 --> 08:43.750
very, very careful?

08:45.041 --> 08:47.417
It's worth the risk
to find out what Harper's up to.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.625
Let's just-- let's get on with it.

08:54.041 --> 08:56.625
(echoing) Don't get brain damage!

08:59.041 --> 09:00.083
Hello, Ryan.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.333
Miss me?

09:05.417 --> 09:07.875
-How are you still alive?
-Long story, don't have time.

09:07.959 --> 09:09.750
I'm in a little bit of a lot of trouble.

09:10.709 --> 09:13.166
So you call the person
that hates you the most?

09:13.250 --> 09:15.500
You know I want
to drop you off a cliff right now?

09:15.583 --> 09:16.917
Why would I help you?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.583
Because I'm being held prisoner by Grey.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.417
Grey? What does she want with you?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.875
She's using me
to make monsters and mutate the gel.

09:24.959 --> 09:26.834
She's up to something big.

09:26.917 --> 09:29.250
I mean, why do you think
I've been trying to help you?

09:29.333 --> 09:30.667
And honestly, Ryan,

09:31.417 --> 09:33.375
I don't know
what she's gonna do to me next.

09:33.458 --> 09:35.917
Why would I give a flying taco
about what happens to you?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.333
(Spyder) Do flying tacos exist?

09:37.417 --> 09:40.959
If you find me, you find Grey,
you take her out and boom!

09:41.041 --> 09:43.083
You go back to being a regular teenager.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.625
Spoiler alert: Prom is super fun!

09:45.709 --> 09:47.625
Then I go live on a sandy beach somewhere.

09:47.709 --> 09:50.750
I was thinking something more
like bars and a padlock.

09:50.834 --> 09:53.792
Kind of aggressive, but I'll take it.
It's better than being her slave.

09:53.875 --> 09:55.750
Fine. Where are you?

09:55.834 --> 09:57.709
Being held near Colton Ridge.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.625
By the storm drain.

10:00.709 --> 10:02.166
Grey is coming back. Hurry!

10:02.250 --> 10:04.834
(Grey) Get... to... work!

10:08.417 --> 10:10.208
Control center, now!

10:18.375 --> 10:19.667
That's the last of it.

10:20.709 --> 10:22.500
This better work.

10:24.709 --> 10:26.375
Good talk.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
We're gonna go rescue Harper?

10:50.709 --> 10:52.083
Not rescue, capture.

10:52.166 --> 10:54.291
Are you sure that's what you'll do
when you find him?

10:54.375 --> 10:55.709
What's that supposed to mean?

10:56.417 --> 10:58.625
Last time you accidentally
shorted out stuff,

10:58.709 --> 11:00.083
because you were hiding something.

11:01.709 --> 11:05.000
Guys, Leo may have a lead
on my biological father.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.834
Harper's the reason
he had to go into hiding.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.709
With Harper still out there,

11:10.792 --> 11:12.250
he's a danger to my birth father.

11:12.333 --> 11:13.834
I can't expose him to that.

11:13.917 --> 11:16.417
Until Harper's out of our lives,

11:16.500 --> 11:18.125
I can't meet my father.

11:22.875 --> 11:25.375
Just promise me that you're not
gonna do anything to Harper

11:25.458 --> 11:26.625
that you're gonna regret.

11:27.250 --> 11:28.667
I promise.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.166
All right.

11:33.291 --> 11:34.750
When do we leave?

11:53.041 --> 11:54.166
Okay.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.208
Scanning.

11:57.291 --> 12:00.291
I'm detecting one human,
but he's underground.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.291
See that storm drain?

12:02.375 --> 12:04.834
There's a ladder that leads
down to some chamber.

12:04.917 --> 12:07.667
-He must be there.
-Good! Let's get this guy.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.083
That's far enough!

12:26.625 --> 12:28.500
-Harris, now!
-(roaring)

12:33.417 --> 12:34.875
(grunts)

12:35.709 --> 12:36.959
What did you do to me?

12:37.041 --> 12:39.083
Ooze antidote!
We were ready for you this time.

12:39.166 --> 12:41.000
Boom! It won't cure you

12:41.083 --> 12:42.875
because you were infected
by the zapped ooze.

12:42.959 --> 12:44.333
But it will at least mess you up.

12:45.041 --> 12:46.917
I got my eye on her. Go.

12:54.125 --> 12:55.667
This is it.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.291
Guys, you made it! Oh, thank goodness.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.667
I'd roll out the red carpet,
but I'm a little, you know, chained up.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.625
-Yeah, get used to that.
-Really?

13:09.709 --> 13:13.750
You sure? Because I have 1.5 billion
dollars hidden around the city.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.875
-And we don't want your money
-Oh, okay, okay.

13:15.959 --> 13:18.125
So, compromise:
We take the money, then we betray him.

13:18.208 --> 13:21.041
You know I can hear you, right?
I'm right here.

13:21.125 --> 13:23.166
-Oh.
-Ryan, don't!

13:27.542 --> 13:28.875
I promised, didn't I?

13:28.959 --> 13:30.250
(clears throat)

13:31.834 --> 13:33.125
Thanks.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.000
Hey, guys, come on.
We're on the same side here.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.625
-The lesser of two evils...
-Is still evil!

13:38.709 --> 13:41.667
Yeah, study algebra, learn Spanish.
I choose neither, thus, I win.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.583
-Harris!
-Hey, I got you.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.166
Come on, buddy.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.417
She got the drop on me, Ry.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.375
I'm sorry. I tried everything--

13:50.458 --> 13:51.375
Oh, boy.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.250
(Harris) Not the time! Not the time!

13:56.208 --> 13:57.667
(monster roars)

14:00.250 --> 14:01.875
He interrupted the process.

14:02.959 --> 14:05.834
What can I do for you? What do you need?

14:09.250 --> 14:12.583
(guttural voice) I need power!

14:13.667 --> 14:15.625
Run!

14:16.166 --> 14:17.667
(Harris) I'm too pretty to die!

14:17.750 --> 14:19.375
-Run!
-This way!

14:19.458 --> 14:22.917
(Harper) Spider, rhino--
I call it Arachna-Rhino!

14:23.000 --> 14:24.959
Look out! Look out!

14:25.375 --> 14:28.041
Not the time! Not the time!

14:28.542 --> 14:29.625
Other way!

14:29.709 --> 14:30.917
(screams)

14:35.166 --> 14:37.375
(Harper screaming)

14:40.375 --> 14:42.834
-What was that?
-Don't worry if you wet yourself.

14:42.917 --> 14:44.583
We all did it the first time there.

14:44.667 --> 14:48.000
Amazing! Plus, an elevator
that can kill you?

14:48.083 --> 14:49.917
Classic Leo.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.375
(groans)

14:51.458 --> 14:54.000
(snorting)

14:54.083 --> 14:55.667
All right, let's squish this thing.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.625
-What's a spider's weakness?
-Fractions.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.792
Here it comes. Shields up!

15:08.125 --> 15:10.208
(groans)

15:25.917 --> 15:27.542
Dang, he's tough.

15:27.625 --> 15:30.291
Yeah, it's a little bit
of spider, a little bit of rhino.

15:30.375 --> 15:31.834
I call it, "Arachna-Rhino."

15:31.917 --> 15:33.291
I name the monsters here.

15:33.375 --> 15:34.917
Stop being nice to the sociopath.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.875
(Spyder) It's twerking.
Why is it twerking?

15:40.959 --> 15:42.583
Is it mooning us?

15:46.959 --> 15:48.208
It's gonna get a lot worse.

15:53.917 --> 15:55.458
I can't move the robot's arms!

15:55.542 --> 15:56.917
I can't fire the rockets!

15:57.000 --> 15:58.792
I will not be able to unsee this.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.291
So gross.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.250
We've got to burn through this stuff.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.125
-X-weapon?
-X-weapon!

16:08.583 --> 16:10.333
-Ready?
-Ready!

16:11.500 --> 16:14.834
What? Guys, I'm with you.
We're Mech-X5 now!

16:14.917 --> 16:16.625
-No! No, no. Uh-uh.
-Never gonna happen!

16:26.166 --> 16:27.542
Mech-Xecute!

16:40.458 --> 16:42.417
-Yes!
-Oh, yeah!

16:43.583 --> 16:44.959
Hey, what about Grey?

16:47.667 --> 16:51.000
She's gone! And all I can find
are traces of the red ooze.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.000
Where did she go?

16:58.291 --> 17:01.250
(laughs) That was awesome!
Hey, where are the rest of the guys?

17:01.333 --> 17:04.375
I was thinking of springing for jackets
but I need to know their sizes.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.542
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What-what-- what's going on?

17:12.125 --> 17:13.291
(grunts)

17:13.375 --> 17:14.875
Harris says that...

17:14.959 --> 17:17.792
this will erase your mind
if you use it for too long.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.709
And I promised my brother
I wouldn't do anything I'd regret.

17:22.792 --> 17:25.333
But erasing your mind?

17:26.208 --> 17:27.959
I'll sleep just fine.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.709
If you're worried about me
telling you're the pilot, don't.

17:31.792 --> 17:34.500
-We're on the same side now.
-Shut it!

17:34.583 --> 17:36.917
This isn't about my secret identity.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.667
This is about what you did to my mom.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.291
And this city!

17:40.375 --> 17:45.125
This is about you driving my birth parents
into hiding when I was just a baby.

17:46.125 --> 17:50.125
One way or another, you've been
messing with me my whole life!

17:51.583 --> 17:53.333
But not anymore.

17:56.959 --> 17:58.375
Think about what you're saying.

17:59.417 --> 18:00.917
(scoffs) Oh, I have.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.834
You, drooling and brainless...

18:02.917 --> 18:04.417
everyone is safer.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.542
And there's a little bit
more justice in the world.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.166
You don't have to do this.
You could take me to prison.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.750
You still have followers.

18:13.417 --> 18:16.667
You can still do
a lot of damage from prison.

18:16.750 --> 18:20.125
This way, you won't hurt
anyone ever again.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.500
(groaning)

18:23.583 --> 18:25.125
Okay. Okay.

18:25.959 --> 18:27.709
But I want you to know,

18:27.792 --> 18:29.709
I am proud of you.

18:30.625 --> 18:32.041
What's that supposed to mean?

18:32.125 --> 18:34.458
I mean, you get it now!

18:35.208 --> 18:38.208
You're finally the hero
you were meant to be.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.458
The kind that's not afraid
to make the hard decisions.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.250
Just like me.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.458
You are no hero.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.500
And we're nothing alike.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.500
Oh, really?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.834
Eliminating people for the greater good?

18:54.750 --> 18:56.625
Sounds familiar.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.667
Face it, Ryan,

18:59.417 --> 19:00.709
you and I,

19:01.834 --> 19:03.375
we're the same.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.959
No!

19:06.583 --> 19:08.458
(grunts)

19:08.542 --> 19:10.041
Ah!

19:18.125 --> 19:19.792
You burned out the neurosplicer.

19:20.417 --> 19:22.792
We are nothing alike.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.250
And we're never gonna be alike.

19:26.208 --> 19:27.792
Enjoy prison.

19:31.458 --> 19:32.959
Hey, Ry-Guy,

19:33.041 --> 19:34.375
remind me what happened to you

19:34.458 --> 19:36.417
the first time I tried
to contact you with this.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.625
-(high-pitched humming)
(screams)

19:41.250 --> 19:43.625
(distorted) That's right,
it did not go well.

19:43.709 --> 19:45.417
(Ryan groans)

19:48.166 --> 19:49.917
(groaning continues)

19:54.375 --> 19:55.542
-I could end you...
-(beeps)

19:55.625 --> 19:57.625
Ahh!

19:58.333 --> 19:59.750
...right now.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.250
-But I won't.
-(groans)

20:13.333 --> 20:15.709
We're going to do
great things together, Ryan.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.750
I'll see you soon...

20:19.291 --> 20:20.959
partner.

20:21.041 --> 20:22.542
(humming fades)

20:34.917 --> 20:37.291
We had him, and I blew it!

20:37.375 --> 20:39.750
I should have just--
I should have taken him in.

20:40.458 --> 20:44.291
But he played me.
He knew exactly which buttons to push.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.875
(sighs) We also lost Grey.

20:46.959 --> 20:48.458
That's my bad.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.417
Don't worry about it.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.166
We'll get them both,

20:53.250 --> 20:54.583
and we'll do it right, now.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.250
Well, in that case...

20:57.667 --> 20:58.917
(phone chimes)

20:59.000 --> 21:02.250
"Sorry, Veracity. Can't make our date."

21:02.959 --> 21:04.375
(phone chimes)

21:04.458 --> 21:07.291
Huh. It's-- it's not a date.
Who knew that?

21:08.083 --> 21:10.375
-I knew! I'm the one that--
-We all knew.

21:10.458 --> 21:11.792
-(Leo) Hi, there!
-(all shout)

21:11.875 --> 21:15.291
Oh. The mood in the room is a little low,

21:15.875 --> 21:18.000
but I have some news.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.458
Found your birth father.

21:19.542 --> 21:22.166
-Really? That's--
-Bad news: He's in danger,

21:22.250 --> 21:23.500
and there's not much time.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.333
If you don't do something,

21:26.333 --> 21:27.583
you might lose him forever.

21:33.333 --> 21:36.250
(theme music plays)
