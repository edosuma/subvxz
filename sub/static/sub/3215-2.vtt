13:33.192 --> 13:36.061
The only way to get
through what's going on now

13:36.095 --> 13:39.765
is to think about what's next.

13:39.799 --> 13:44.937
So, when Gwen's released, um...
she's going to need help.

13:44.971 --> 13:47.739
She's going to need therapy,

13:47.774 --> 13:51.944
and she's going to need to be near us.

13:51.978 --> 13:54.379
But we want her to be near Matt, too.

13:54.414 --> 13:56.014

13:57.617 --> 13:59.418
In Oakland.

It's where we're all from.

we never want to see this city again.

14:15.768 --> 14:17.102
It j... It just makes sense.

14:17.136 --> 14:19.438
Maybe we should wait and
see how Gwen progresses.

14:21.507 --> 14:23.875
She's going to be fine.

14:23.910 --> 14:25.811
So, we need to start planning now.

We were with Gwen.

14:39.592 --> 14:42.561
We were at prayer services.

14:42.595 --> 14:44.796
We were praying for our daughter's recovery.

- Tom.

There are gonna be these
various hearings and things,

14:57.543 --> 15:01.813

there, people will notice.

35:13.979 --> 35:14.979
No, you're not.

35:15.014 --> 35:17.482
- I have to. I have to see...
- The house is sealed.

35:17.516 --> 35:19.484
- You're not going inside.
- It's... it's my son's house.

35:19.518 --> 35:20.852
- Your son?
- [Sniffs] Mm-hmm.

35:20.886 --> 35:23.287
- What's your name?
- It's Russ Skokie.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.089
- Is your name on the lease?
- Uh, no.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.858
Then you're not going inside
unless you get a court order.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.559
- No, but it's... It's my son's house.
- I understand that.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.828
- W-why would I need permission to get...
- I under... I understand that it belongs to...

35:30.863 --> 35:33.264
- Into my own son's house?
- I understand that it belongs to your son.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.033
- Why would I possibly need... It's my own son...
- But you... you don't own...

35:35.067 --> 35:36.034
- Sir!
- Five minutes.

35:36.068 --> 35:37.668
- <i>Sir,</i> listen to me.
- Only five minutes.

36:12.477 --> 36:15.212
Tom: So, my conversation
with the police detective...

36:15.246 --> 36:16.646
[Sniffs]

36:16.681 --> 36:20.650
Gwen's rape kit came back from being tested.

36:20.685 --> 36:25.122
Came back negative for any evidence that...

36:25.156 --> 36:27.891
She wasn't assaulted?

36:27.925 --> 36:29.726
It's negative. She wasn't assaulted?

36:29.761 --> 36:31.728
It came back negative for any evidence

36:31.763 --> 36:35.532
that the man who shot Matt assaulted her.

36:35.566 --> 36:37.134
But there is evidence

36:37.168 --> 36:42.005
that she had... intercourse
with somebody else.

36:44.008 --> 36:45.909
I don't understand.

36:45.943 --> 36:47.911
- She was raped.
- No.

36:47.945 --> 36:50.981
No, they don't think it was rape anymore.

36:51.015 --> 36:56.153
They think it was some
kind of consensual sex.

36:56.187 --> 36:58.655
- A kind?
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.689 --> 37:00.157
What kind?

37:00.191 --> 37:02.492
- What kind of sex do they confuse for rape?
- But they're running other tests.

37:02.527 --> 37:03.894
Okay? They're running other tests.

37:03.928 --> 37:08.064
But the detective said
they think that, um...

37:08.099 --> 37:10.500
There was more than one man.

37:10.535 --> 37:12.736
[Sighs]

37:14.506 --> 37:15.572
I can't talk about this.

37:15.607 --> 37:18.108
- No, we need to know what happened.
- And do what?

37:18.143 --> 37:20.110
What changes?

37:20.145 --> 37:22.679
Russ was asking me questions
about Matt and Gwen,

37:22.714 --> 37:24.114
- if they were all right.
- Leave that family out of it.

37:24.149 --> 37:25.682
- If they were happy.
- All of them.

37:25.717 --> 37:27.684
They're damaged.

37:27.719 --> 37:29.520
I don't want to hear about any of it.

37:29.554 --> 37:31.688
So, please.

37:31.723 --> 37:34.324
Please just leave it, okay?

37:34.359 --> 37:35.726
Something happened with our daughter.

37:35.760 --> 37:37.728
She's holding on to her life.

37:37.762 --> 37:38.762
That's what's happening.

37:38.797 --> 37:41.031
And you want to talk about
whether she was raped,

37:41.065 --> 37:42.466
- whether she wasn't raped.
- Yes, I do.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.667
Why? What difference does it make?

37:43.701 --> 37:45.536
- Because that is not the child that I raised.
- Don't do it!

37:45.570 --> 37:47.337
Don't do it to her! Don't! Oh, my God.

37:47.372 --> 37:50.541
The very thought of her
with... with other men,

37:50.575 --> 37:52.543
- just makes me sick to my stomach.
- Give me your phone.

37:52.577 --> 37:53.444
- What?
- Give it to me.

37:53.478 --> 37:56.146
- Why?
- Give me your phone! I want it.

37:56.181 --> 37:57.681
Give it...

37:57.715 --> 37:59.516
Get...

37:59.551 --> 38:02.820
Give it to me.

38:02.854 --> 38:04.488
[Beep]

38:09.127 --> 38:12.729
[Sighs]

38:12.764 --> 38:14.164
That's her.

38:17.635 --> 38:18.836
That's our daughter.

38:18.870 --> 38:20.237
Gwen: <i>Daddy.</i>

38:20.271 --> 38:21.939
That's her. [ <i>Chuckles</i> ]

38:21.973 --> 38:23.540
Look.

38:23.575 --> 38:26.176
Look at her. [Inhales sharply]

38:29.581 --> 38:32.549
That's all you need to know.

38:32.584 --> 38:35.552
That's all.

38:35.587 --> 38:37.754
While she's laying there...

38:41.092 --> 38:43.694
That's how you remember her.

38:49.634 --> 38:51.802
[Sighs]

38:51.836 --> 38:53.871
[Birds chirping]

38:56.107 --> 39:00.377
Nancy: So, I heard about your
son and his wife on the news.

39:00.411 --> 39:02.779
You should know that I'm a survivor, too.

39:02.814 --> 39:03.614
When I tell you that I know

39:03.648 --> 39:05.148
what you're going through, I mean it.

39:05.183 --> 39:07.384
I've been there.

39:07.418 --> 39:09.753
I... reached out to you...

39:09.787 --> 39:12.623
to your organization because...

39:15.026 --> 39:17.794
I need help. [Clears throat]

39:17.829 --> 39:20.230
And that's not easy for me to ask.

39:20.265 --> 39:23.000
Everything I've done for m-my boys...

39:23.034 --> 39:26.637
I-I-I've done everything on my own.

39:26.671 --> 39:31.008
You're not letting anyone
down by asking for help.

39:31.042 --> 39:33.810
What you're facing is complicated.

39:33.845 --> 39:35.979
As the survivor of a victim,

39:36.014 --> 39:38.749
there are rights you're entitled to.

39:38.783 --> 39:39.783
On your website,

39:39.817 --> 39:41.685
I read that you will
advocate in the court...

39:41.719 --> 39:43.854
If you haven't been properly informed

39:43.888 --> 39:45.822
about any aspect of the legal proceedings,

39:45.857 --> 39:48.458
- if you've been denied an impact statement...
- No, I need something else.

39:48.493 --> 39:50.093
I need...

39:53.498 --> 39:55.465
Look, I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say,

39:55.500 --> 39:57.868
and you can react however you...

39:57.902 --> 40:00.270
If you had three whites

40:00.305 --> 40:01.838
who went into a black's house

40:01.873 --> 40:03.840
and murdered him, raped his wife,

40:03.875 --> 40:05.842
you would have all these black leaders

40:05.877 --> 40:08.845
on Anderson Cooper talking
about how it's a hate crime

40:08.880 --> 40:10.881
and how there ought to be
some special treatment.

40:10.915 --> 40:13.116
[Inhales deeply] But...

40:15.753 --> 40:20.324
But it happens to my son and his wife?

40:20.358 --> 40:22.526
Who's out there for them?

40:22.560 --> 40:25.128
I mean, nobody.

40:25.163 --> 40:27.130
Because...

40:27.165 --> 40:30.133
You know, hate crimes can't
happen to white people.

40:30.168 --> 40:34.137
- That's not true.
- They're blaming my son.

40:34.172 --> 40:37.140
[Voice breaking] They're
trying to blame my son.

40:37.175 --> 40:38.909
I'm...

40:38.943 --> 40:40.544
[Sniffles]

40:40.578 --> 40:43.146
- I'm tired.
- Mm-hmm.

40:43.181 --> 40:47.184
[Sniffles] I'm... I'm tired.

40:53.057 --> 40:58.328
You... you need to know what's ahead of you.

40:58.363 --> 41:01.732
It's gonna be slow, long.

41:01.766 --> 41:04.534
Might be a year, maybe even more than a year

41:04.569 --> 41:07.904
before the case even goes to trial.

41:07.939 --> 41:11.108
The other side will do anything,

41:11.142 --> 41:14.544
say anything about your
son, you, your family

41:14.579 --> 41:16.546
to walk away from what they did.

41:16.581 --> 41:22.352
You need to advocate
every day, all the time.

41:22.387 --> 41:25.122
But you also need to decide

41:25.156 --> 41:27.924
what you can put yourself through.

41:27.959 --> 41:30.360
Can you handle it?

41:34.799 --> 41:36.833
It's not about me.

41:38.503 --> 41:40.904
All this is about my son.

41:45.476 --> 41:46.910
I need help.

41:48.980 --> 41:54.785
I need... people with me.

41:54.819 --> 41:59.790
But whatever I have to do,
however I have to do it,

41:59.824 --> 42:04.461
there is nothing I won't do for my child.
