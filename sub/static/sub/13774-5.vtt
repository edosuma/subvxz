WEBVTT

00:00.914 --> 00:04.950
Legs...
strong, useful and practical.

00:05.070 --> 00:09.908
Sometimes we take them for granted.
But not people with lower limotaxia.

00:09.975 --> 00:13.344
Otherwise known as Thurber-
Horngood Syndrome.

00:13.412 --> 00:14.546
Oh, my God!

00:14.613 --> 00:16.385
- What do you...? Jenny!
- What?

00:16.505 --> 00:17.757
Come here.
You got to look at this thing.

00:17.877 --> 00:21.185
That's why I'm taking pledges
so I can fulfill one of my

00:21.253 --> 00:24.312
life's dreams: to run the marathon.

00:24.847 --> 00:27.306
For those who can't run.

00:27.337 --> 00:28.527
No!

00:29.795 --> 00:31.195
Oh, yes.

00:31.914 --> 00:35.366
Dearest Zola Budd, I'm
very pleased to learn that

00:35.434 --> 00:39.804
you've chosen the marathon as
your next triumph in a long line

00:39.872 --> 00:41.806
of stupid, stupid exercise fads.

00:41.874 --> 00:42.941
What?

00:44.113 --> 00:47.925
I'm strengthening my core just
like Joseph Pilates intended.

00:48.045 --> 00:49.814
I'm the master of the stairs!

00:49.882 --> 00:53.151
It's more complicated than most stairs.
No one was supposed to see that.

00:53.218 --> 00:54.752
You want a nose job? Bam!

00:54.820 --> 00:55.820
How about a breast reduction?

00:55.888 --> 00:56.821
Bam-bam-bam!

00:56.889 --> 00:59.490
Why would you do it, why
would you video it, and then

00:59.558 --> 01:01.145
why would you tell me
where the videos are?

01:01.265 --> 01:03.409
What do Andre and *** have in common?

01:03.529 --> 01:04.703
The sauna suit.

01:05.063 --> 01:07.065
Cardio tennis! Whoo!

01:07.132 --> 01:08.833
Forehand!

01:08.901 --> 01:10.603
Backhand!

01:10.723 --> 01:11.433
♪♪♪

01:11.553 --> 01:15.629
Oh, Pete, you are the Ken Burns
of making Andre look like an asshole.

01:15.749 --> 01:18.049
Shedding the pounds
like Chicago's bravest.

01:18.169 --> 01:20.552
I'm polar ***

01:21.622 --> 01:23.422
These were private videos.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.378
A sexy sweat.

01:25.498 --> 01:27.554
I wish I could slip a dollar
through the computer.

01:27.674 --> 01:29.420
I'm a red-hot fireman.

01:29.488 --> 01:30.855
Where's the fire?

01:31.525 --> 01:33.044
Don't forget your anal Kegels.

01:33.164 --> 01:38.123
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:38.530 --> 01:40.264
This is so great, you guys:

01:40.332 --> 01:43.201
being in the league, hanging
out with you guys at the bar.

01:43.268 --> 01:44.385
- It's like a date night.
- Yeah.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.536
Yeah?

01:45.604 --> 01:47.105
No, this is not like a date night.

01:47.172 --> 01:50.008
And this is not the way two people who
go head-to-head should be acting.

01:50.075 --> 01:53.344
Would you rath...?

01:53.412 --> 01:54.879
This week I'm gonna take you down!

01:54.947 --> 01:55.947
I'm taking you down!

01:57.282 --> 01:58.716
Ugh!

01:58.784 --> 02:01.886
Guys, we're just talking about a
little friendly competition here.

02:01.954 --> 02:02.887
There's no friendliness.

02:02.955 --> 02:04.188
There's no love in the league.

02:04.256 --> 02:06.458
I just think you guys are worried
she's gonna kick your ass.

02:06.578 --> 02:07.162
Should be.

02:07.282 --> 02:10.679
No, no, no, no. What I'm worried about
is collision between you two.

02:10.799 --> 02:14.332
Lying at home beneath your
80-thread-count sheets, dreaming

02:14.400 --> 02:17.402
of a better life and
whispering football secrets.

02:17.469 --> 02:19.871
That's that, what happens
between our sheets.

02:21.173 --> 02:22.874
I don't want to hear that.

02:22.941 --> 02:25.143
By the way, it wasn't a stripper pole.

02:25.210 --> 02:26.210
It was a fireman's pole.

02:26.278 --> 02:28.946
Really? Did the pole end
up in a fireman's truck?

02:29.014 --> 02:30.181
No.

02:30.249 --> 02:31.516
Stripper pole.

02:31.583 --> 02:32.950
What's the deal with the outfit?

02:33.018 --> 02:35.953
This? It's for the marathon.

02:36.021 --> 02:36.954
What?

02:37.022 --> 02:37.789
The marathon.

02:37.856 --> 02:38.489
The what?

02:38.557 --> 02:39.357
The marathon.

02:39.425 --> 02:40.358
The what?

02:40.426 --> 02:41.959
Oh, okay, ha-ha-ha, very funny.

02:42.027 --> 02:42.827
I get it.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.295
Hey, why are you
dressed like that?

02:44.363 --> 02:44.829
The marathon.

02:44.897 --> 02:45.817
The what?

02:46.126 --> 02:49.267
Make fun all you want.
I'm in peak performance mode.

02:49.334 --> 02:51.602
What are you drinking?

02:51.670 --> 02:54.105
Oh, it's this amazing
energy supplement.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.855
It's Sports Performance
Utility Nutrition Kick.

02:58.081 --> 02:59.844
S.P.U.N.K.

02:59.912 --> 03:01.479
Yeah.
Oh, you guys heard of it.

03:01.547 --> 03:02.447
Yeah, it's the best.

03:02.514 --> 03:04.482
Spunk is amazing.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.284
It just gives me so much more energy.

03:06.351 --> 03:07.452
I just suck these down.

03:07.519 --> 03:08.619
I love Spunk.

03:08.687 --> 03:10.624
But what does it taste like,
just out of curiosity.

03:10.744 --> 03:11.604
A little salty.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.658
But when you're running,
you just want it.

03:13.726 --> 03:15.193
Like, I want some Spunk, you know?

03:15.260 --> 03:16.961
Do you have a favorite flavor Spunk?

03:17.029 --> 03:20.431
I don't think they have flavors or
just different I like the black kind.

03:20.499 --> 03:20.998
Mm-hmm.

03:21.066 --> 03:22.633
So where do you get this stuff?

03:22.701 --> 03:23.601
Mm, I got a guy.

03:23.669 --> 03:24.435
Anyone need anything?

03:24.503 --> 03:25.503
Do you have a juicer?

03:25.571 --> 03:26.437
No.

03:26.505 --> 03:27.872
'Cause I'm running the marathon.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.073
I'm trying to drink healthy.

03:29.141 --> 03:29.907
Good for you.

03:29.975 --> 03:31.142
Let me take care of this.

03:31.210 --> 03:31.909
I got it.

03:31.977 --> 03:34.698
Yeah, it's for charity.
I just wanted to kinda give back.

03:34.818 --> 03:37.173
- That is so sweet.
- I'm actually running the marathon as well.

03:37.293 --> 03:39.125
- Are you? Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

03:39.245 --> 03:40.918
- No, you're not.
- Oh, yes, I am, yeah.

03:40.986 --> 03:43.154
I think it's great you guys are
both running the marathon.

03:43.222 --> 03:44.522
I am... running it.

03:44.590 --> 03:46.257
So, uh, you want a juice, too?

03:46.325 --> 03:46.924
You know what?

03:46.992 --> 03:48.559
I think I'll have a hefeweizen.

03:48.627 --> 03:50.027
I'm running, he's not.

03:50.095 --> 03:52.263
He didn't even know
about eating Spunk.

03:52.331 --> 03:56.234
Ugh! There is this asshole in my
office who is just like Andre.

03:56.301 --> 03:57.904
It's this woman who's a notary.

03:58.024 --> 04:00.271
And she runs the marathon for charity.

04:00.339 --> 04:03.741
The only thing worse than
running a marathon is running

04:03.809 --> 04:06.010
a marathon and then asking
for money to do it.

04:06.078 --> 04:08.993
It's like, I'm not gonna pay you
to lose weight. It's a scam.

04:09.113 --> 04:10.521
Then don't do it.
Don't give her any money.

04:10.641 --> 04:11.562
What's a notary?

04:11.914 --> 04:15.986
A notary is, like, a person who makes things
official with, like a stamp or a notebook.

04:16.024 --> 04:18.122
It's actually something
simple enough for you to do.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.077
Oh.

04:19.197 --> 04:20.921
Yeah, this woman is a real bitch.

04:21.041 --> 04:22.849
She's, like, a real canotary.

04:22.969 --> 04:24.276
Guys, come on.

04:24.396 --> 04:25.996
I'm not censoring
myself in front of her.

04:28.797 --> 04:31.990
- That was so fun, wasn't it?
- It really was.

04:32.110 --> 04:35.921
Oh, my God, I fit in I
was pretty impressive.

04:36.041 --> 04:36.974
It was impressive.

04:37.042 --> 04:38.976
Not as impressive as what's
happening right now, though.

04:39.044 --> 04:40.240
Yeah?
Feel good?

04:40.266 --> 04:41.110
It does feel good.

04:41.230 --> 04:45.639
What feels good is when Frank Gore is gonna
score three TDs on you you on Sunday?

04:45.759 --> 04:47.296
No, not really.

04:47.416 --> 04:50.988
Mmm. How about when Jay Feely's
gonna kick a 60-yard field goal?

04:51.056 --> 04:53.157
No, no. Okay, all right...
That is hot.

04:53.225 --> 04:54.473
No, no, it's not hot.
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

04:54.593 --> 04:55.640
No way! I'm talking smack.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.793
No, I don't want to talk smack
when I'm about to enter you.

04:58.595 --> 05:01.499
Look, the thought of you beating
me does not keep me hard.

05:01.567 --> 05:02.321
Ah, see?

05:02.441 --> 05:03.883
Even you know you're gonna lose.

05:04.003 --> 05:06.003
Mm, knowing that I'm losing
is blood flow down there.

05:06.071 --> 05:07.138
I'm at, like, 40% right now.

05:08.581 --> 05:10.445
- You can't handle this?
- 20%.

05:10.565 --> 05:13.010
Come on, it's fun, healthy No.
I just basically have to

05:13.078 --> 05:14.680
tie a stick to it to get it in now.

05:14.934 --> 05:16.959
That is not hot at all.

05:18.183 --> 05:22.320
Good night.
Good night.

05:30.166 --> 05:33.458
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?
- Hey.

05:33.578 --> 05:35.371
What am I doing?
I'm training for the marathon.

05:35.491 --> 05:36.957
- For the what?
- The marathon.

05:36.983 --> 05:37.632
- The what?
- The what?

05:37.686 --> 05:39.593
You know what? Shut up.
You've been up all night?

05:39.713 --> 05:40.661
You've been up all night?

05:40.781 --> 05:42.527
- No I haven't been...
- We've been up all night too.

05:42.574 --> 05:44.077
- You are drunk.
- I am not drunk.

05:44.132 --> 05:45.415
I'm training.

05:45.535 --> 05:46.437
You're not training.

05:46.482 --> 05:47.341
How do you know that?

05:47.404 --> 05:49.908
You so confident you gonna run,
let's put some money on it.

05:50.028 --> 05:52.396
It's okay. We've believe that
you're running the marathon.

05:52.464 --> 05:53.430
You don't have to believe me.

05:53.498 --> 05:54.164
I am running the marathon.

05:54.232 --> 05:55.299
It's you.

05:55.367 --> 05:57.301
Right. Yeah, I'm gonna
crush you in the marathon.

05:57.369 --> 05:59.436
Let's put a bet on it: $1,000 I
have a better time than you.

05:59.504 --> 06:00.104
$2,000.

06:00.171 --> 06:01.105
Oh, you're on.

06:01.172 --> 06:02.106
Oh. You got to warm up.

06:02.173 --> 06:03.107
'Cause I'm taking it.

06:03.174 --> 06:04.108
There he goes.

06:04.175 --> 06:05.342
I'll see you on the track.

06:05.410 --> 06:06.343
Look how excited he is.

06:06.411 --> 06:07.344
He's so great.

06:07.412 --> 06:12.032
Hey, I'm sort of in a rush this
morning, so I got to... I'm in here.

06:12.249 --> 06:13.776
What? No breakfast?

06:13.896 --> 06:16.650
Oh, I couldn't sleep.
I am so excited about my matchups.

06:16.651 --> 06:18.874
- Matchups against me.
- Yeah.

06:18.994 --> 06:22.316
I want to talk to Jenny, my wife,
not Jenny, my week four competitor.

06:22.436 --> 06:25.593
- Mm, maybe you should give
her a call sometime. - Oh, okay.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.831
We're treading on
dangerous ground here.

06:27.899 --> 06:30.234
We don't want to turn into
the Hutus and the Tutsis.

06:30.301 --> 06:31.468
What?

06:31.536 --> 06:32.469
The Hutus and the Tutsis.

06:32.537 --> 06:34.571
One minute, we're hanging out,
partying, smiling, laughing it

06:34.639 --> 06:38.308
up, next minute, you try to hack I...
It's a horror movie with Don

06:38.376 --> 06:39.343
Cheadle in Africa in the hotel.

06:39.411 --> 06:40.310
Hotel Rwanda?

06:40.378 --> 06:41.919
- Yes.
- Not a horror movie.

06:42.039 --> 06:43.210
- What?!
- True story.

06:43.330 --> 06:45.700
Oh, my.
That makes it so much worse.

06:45.820 --> 06:47.269
We can't let that happen to us.

06:47.389 --> 06:48.633
But the most important thing is

06:48.753 --> 06:50.688
we have to make an accord
with each other that fantasy

06:50.755 --> 06:52.923
football will not
effect our home life.

06:52.991 --> 06:54.124
Okay.

06:54.192 --> 06:56.193
Just a little friendly competition.

06:56.261 --> 06:57.194
I'm friendly.

06:57.262 --> 06:58.262
You don't seem very friendly.

06:58.329 --> 06:59.196
No, I'm friendly.

06:59.264 --> 07:00.197
How friendly?

07:00.265 --> 07:02.433
I'll consummate this
agreement here on the table.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.703
Really?
I am still really hungry, though.

07:10.108 --> 07:11.008
Ruxin.

07:11.076 --> 07:12.009
Twyla!

07:12.077 --> 07:13.143
Why don't you come in?

07:13.211 --> 07:15.255
Look, I know you have been avoiding me.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.761
But I need a donation from you

07:17.881 --> 07:19.598
for Team Twyla, for our marathon.

07:19.718 --> 07:23.153
Yeah. I just don't know if I'm
supporting Team Twyla this year.

07:23.221 --> 07:24.154
Excuse me?

07:24.222 --> 07:26.356
See, I just don't negotiate
with charity terrorists.

07:26.424 --> 07:27.958
What are charity terrorists?

07:28.026 --> 07:30.961
Charity terrorists are people
like yourself who force me to

07:31.029 --> 07:33.743
give money to things against my will.

07:33.863 --> 07:36.007
It's almost a jihad against my wallet.

07:36.127 --> 07:37.234
Let me ask you a question, Twyla.

07:37.302 --> 07:37.868
Sure.

07:37.936 --> 07:39.737
How much of that marathon
did you run last year?

07:39.804 --> 07:42.172
Well, I walked as much as I
could and then I ran a bit and

07:42.240 --> 07:42.873
then I walked some!

07:42.941 --> 07:45.309
On that walk, did you stop at TCBY?

07:45.376 --> 07:46.176
Yes.

07:46.244 --> 07:48.078
Well, I also love the
country's best yogurt, but I

07:48.146 --> 07:50.748
don't expect you to pay me to go
on the elliptical to work it off.

07:50.815 --> 07:52.983
But if you do want to lose some
weight, you could start by not

07:53.051 --> 07:54.752
eating my chicken salad
sandwich out of the fridge.

07:54.819 --> 07:57.588
Okay, well, then why don't you
put your name on it, Rodney?

07:57.655 --> 07:59.391
'Kay, everybody calls me Ruxin.

07:59.511 --> 08:02.446
And I can't believe I am working
in an office with hungry hungry hippos.

08:04.293 --> 08:05.510
Whoo!
Ha-ha-ha!

08:05.630 --> 08:07.106
Oh, my God.

08:07.226 --> 08:10.613
Chill hours, 15 minutes from my house
to your house.

08:10.733 --> 08:12.703
Who needs cars when you're the flash?

08:12.771 --> 08:14.772
What's the name of the
dude you're chasing?

08:14.839 --> 08:17.374
Ugh, Andre, you smell like
eighth-grade kids who haven't

08:17.442 --> 08:18.509
learned to use deodorant yet.

08:18.576 --> 08:22.583
That's actually 'cause this is wicked
oil moisture bouncing off me, it's going out.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.728
Stop wicking.

08:23.848 --> 08:24.782
What about you?

08:24.849 --> 08:26.350
Are you wicking anything away?

08:26.417 --> 08:28.185
I'm working my ass off over here.

08:28.253 --> 08:30.721
This women's basketball game,
this is, like, the Heartbreak

08:30.789 --> 08:32.356
Hill of channel surfing.

08:32.423 --> 08:34.792
You...
are gonna lose this bet.

08:34.859 --> 08:36.293
Tortoise. Hare.

08:36.361 --> 08:37.294
Tortoise. Hare.

08:37.361 --> 08:38.895
Uh, I think you got that backwards.

08:38.962 --> 08:39.797
The hare ends up losing.

08:39.864 --> 08:41.799
That's 'cause the hare got
cocky and was dehydrated.

08:41.866 --> 08:42.799
Oh, I'm staying hydrated.

08:42.866 --> 08:44.802
Well, I'm more hydrated than you.

08:44.869 --> 08:45.803
Oh, really?

08:45.870 --> 08:47.805
Yeah. Do you want to have
a hydrating contest?

08:47.872 --> 08:48.939
Hydration? Huh? Hm?

08:49.007 --> 08:50.307
That's a bad idea.

08:50.375 --> 08:51.642
He thinks I'm still chugging.

08:51.709 --> 08:53.243
I'm just gonna let him
finish it and suffer.

08:53.311 --> 08:54.411
Oh, my God.

08:55.547 --> 08:56.814
Are you crying?

08:56.881 --> 08:59.283
No.
My eyes are just hydrated.

08:59.350 --> 09:02.252
I got to use your bathroom.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.053
Please? Thank you.

09:03.121 --> 09:10.093
Sweetheart, I got to go, so bye, guys.
Um, Sunday you could pick Ellie

09:10.161 --> 09:12.462
Yeah, but you usually pick up Ellie.

09:12.530 --> 09:14.331
Sunday I like to tinker
around with my lineup.

09:14.399 --> 09:16.827
I know, so I'm kind of saving
you from yourself.

09:16.947 --> 09:20.133
You don't need to save me from myself.
I can save myself.

09:21.130 --> 09:22.023
From myself.

09:22.143 --> 09:22.840
So you got her? Sunday?

09:22.960 --> 09:23.841
Yeah, I'll get her.

09:23.908 --> 09:24.641
Great. Thank you.

09:24.709 --> 09:25.309
You're welcome.

09:25.376 --> 09:26.243
You're the best.

09:26.311 --> 09:27.277
No, you're the best.

09:27.345 --> 09:29.847
Oh, my God, this is
like awkward Wimbledon.

09:30.548 --> 09:32.282
Sunday you will pick Ellie up?

09:32.350 --> 09:32.850
Sure.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.285
Great. Love you.

09:35.353 --> 09:36.486
You guys are a hot mess.

09:36.554 --> 09:37.120
No, we're not.

09:37.188 --> 09:38.021
Oh, come on!

09:38.089 --> 09:40.524
You're going head-to-head with
her in the league this week...

09:40.592 --> 09:42.492
you're gonna tell me
that's not bothering you?

09:42.560 --> 09:43.594
It's not a big deal.

09:43.661 --> 09:44.795
No. We talked about it.

09:44.863 --> 09:46.663
Union is strong.
We even made a pact.

09:46.731 --> 09:48.665
Oh, you want me to notarize that?

09:48.733 --> 09:50.968
How do you know what
"notarize" means, Taco?

09:51.035 --> 09:55.272
Friends, you are looking
at a licensed notarizer.

09:55.340 --> 09:56.306
The word is "notary."

09:56.374 --> 09:57.608
No, no, that's the plural.

09:57.675 --> 10:00.352
No, it's the perfect job for me, guys.

10:00.472 --> 10:02.357
I love arts & crafts.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.942
Oh, looks like Frank Gore is out this week
with Turf Tow,

10:05.997 --> 10:09.139
Turf Tow? I'd like to see him
run a mile in my shoes.

10:09.259 --> 10:12.192
- Oh please, will you not...
- 26.2...

10:13.152 --> 10:15.951
Wait a second, doesn't Jenny
have Frank Gore?

10:17.301 --> 10:19.299
Holy shit, she's never gonna *** this out.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.448
You gotta volter her backup.

10:20.568 --> 10:22.182
I'm just gonna tell
her about Frank Gore.

10:22.302 --> 10:24.682
- What?!
- I have to. We made an agreement.

10:24.802 --> 10:25.535
This is what it is.

10:25.603 --> 10:27.971
Oh, I didn't realize you were wearing
a dress underneath those pants.

10:28.039 --> 10:29.973
Really? We're gonna talk
about who's wearing what?

10:30.041 --> 10:31.784
Sweep the leg, Johnny!

10:31.904 --> 10:33.024
Don't be rated PG.

10:33.144 --> 10:34.211
Be rated R.

10:34.279 --> 10:35.812
We made an agreement.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.914
It's not notarized.

10:36.981 --> 10:38.181
Guy's got a point.

10:38.249 --> 10:40.405
Well, let's leave him with
his thoughts, gentlemen.

10:41.819 --> 10:43.353
Can somebody give me a ride?

10:43.421 --> 10:45.355
My legs are killing me.

10:48.393 --> 10:53.397
Twyla! Got some stuff I need notarized
from BP v. Minority Fishermen.

10:53.464 --> 10:54.564
Here we go.

10:54.632 --> 10:57.734
Uh-uh. I need to see some
proper form of identification.

10:57.802 --> 11:00.871
Twyla, we've been working in an
office together for five years, so...

11:00.939 --> 11:04.608
- Yeah, but how do I know that you're you?
- Very well.

11:07.679 --> 11:08.512
Drive?

11:08.579 --> 11:12.049
No, we moved a while back...
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:12.116 --> 11:15.519
You're gonna have to come back when
you have some current identification.

11:15.586 --> 11:18.021
This wouldn't have anything to
do with me refusing to donate

11:18.089 --> 11:19.957
to Team Twyla, would it?

11:20.024 --> 11:22.559
Oh, now you're gonna need to
come back with two forms of I.D.

11:22.627 --> 11:23.560
You didn't need any I.D.

11:23.628 --> 11:25.963
yesterday when you were in my
office trolling for money for

11:26.030 --> 11:27.097
your little walkabout!

11:27.165 --> 11:29.299
Yeah, well, then yesterday you
were dealing with Twyla...

11:29.367 --> 11:31.101
now you're dealing with a notary!

11:31.169 --> 11:33.370
All right, well, you want a
second form of identification?

11:33.438 --> 11:34.271
Yes, I do!

11:34.339 --> 11:36.273
How about the name that was
on my goddamn sandwich!

11:36.341 --> 11:38.976
Oh, well, I couldn't read it with
all that chicken scratch on it!

11:39.043 --> 11:40.877
- So you did eat it!
- And it was good.

11:40.945 --> 11:41.645
Oh!

11:42.714 --> 11:43.647
You know what?

11:43.715 --> 11:44.648
Hm?

11:44.716 --> 11:47.651
I hope you lose control of your bowels
like that German marathon runner.

11:47.719 --> 11:48.785
She was Swiss!

11:48.853 --> 11:49.949
Semantics!

11:50.327 --> 11:52.198
Two forms, Rodney!

11:52.508 --> 11:54.565
Goddamn canotary.

11:55.693 --> 11:57.054
What is this?

11:58.299 --> 12:02.566
Hi, everyone. Sorry, you interrupted me
doing business stuff.

12:02.686 --> 12:04.634
I'm Taco from Taco Corp.

12:04.702 --> 12:09.006
You may recognize me as the
number one vintner of Three Penis wine

12:09.073 --> 12:10.774
Chicago Metropolitan area.

12:10.842 --> 12:13.583
Oh... But now I'm starting
a new business.

12:13.703 --> 12:16.331
I am... notarizing.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.630
And I will notarize anything.

12:20.883 --> 12:23.682
Don't hide your thighs,
notarize.

12:27.325 --> 12:28.191
Oh, yeah!

12:28.259 --> 12:31.728
Don't terrorize...
notarize!

12:33.585 --> 12:34.977
Where does he find those people?

12:35.097 --> 12:37.971
Don't ***, notarize!

12:41.160 --> 12:46.843
Don't agonize...
notarize.

12:46.911 --> 12:50.047
There's a homeless
guy in Kevin's house.

12:50.114 --> 12:55.485
Don't apologize...
notarize!

12:55.553 --> 12:56.486
Block.

12:56.554 --> 12:57.487
Need your thumbprint.

12:57.555 --> 12:59.189
Block. 360 spin.

12:59.257 --> 13:00.791
Two valid forms of I.D.

13:00.858 --> 13:02.893
And remember what Taco says:

13:02.960 --> 13:05.495
Don't compromise...
notarize!

13:05.563 --> 13:06.496
Give me a call.

13:06.564 --> 13:07.497
Everything is free.

13:07.565 --> 13:08.365
Taco's a notary, huh?

13:08.433 --> 13:11.835
No, sorry, it's you have to give
me money and then I'll do it.

13:11.903 --> 13:12.736
It's not free.

13:12.804 --> 13:14.738
I keep forgetting that.

13:21.012 --> 13:25.749
Notary business is good, and I have you
to thank. I found a career, people respect

13:25.816 --> 13:28.051
me, and I'm making a change now.

13:28.119 --> 13:31.755
- Think of me as your university of Phoenix.
- You know what?

13:31.822 --> 13:33.256
I'm making dreams happen.

13:33.324 --> 13:34.324
Look at this.

13:34.392 --> 13:37.827
This is a little Asian boy who
wanted to own a powerboat.

13:37.895 --> 13:39.763
Pretty sure it's
illegal in this state.

13:39.830 --> 13:40.864
But guess what?

13:40.932 --> 13:42.032
I made it happen.

13:42.099 --> 13:43.199
You guys need a drink?

13:43.267 --> 13:47.103
I got $120 burning a hole in the
hole in my pocket, so name the

13:47.171 --> 13:48.872
drink... doesn't matter how expensive.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.386
I'd like an old-fashioned, please.

13:50.696 --> 13:51.722
I don't know what that is.

13:51.842 --> 13:57.781
And on the third day, God gave him
a number, and his number was 1729.

13:57.848 --> 14:01.583
That is right, I am an official
marathoner of Chicago.

14:01.823 --> 14:02.724
I'll be there on Sunday.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.944
I need your support...will you come out?
You need a drink, my friend?

14:05.064 --> 14:06.370
Uh, no, Taco.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.358
Keeping the body clean, like a temple.

14:08.426 --> 14:10.527
See, I wish I had...

14:10.595 --> 14:12.494
time for hobbies like that.
Alright.

14:12.614 --> 14:14.165
Have fun in 1971.

14:14.285 --> 14:16.132
You might not know this,
because I haven't seen you

14:16.200 --> 14:18.134
training, but the whole secret
of marathon running is keeping

14:18.202 --> 14:19.970
yourself limber and
flexible at all times.

14:20.037 --> 14:24.207
It's not dressing like you're the
fifth member of Color Me Badd?

14:24.275 --> 14:25.828
Let's hurry up with those
drinks, bartender.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.175
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:27.295 --> 14:28.300
I heard you're a notary.

14:28.420 --> 14:29.852
It's a dirty job.
Someone's got to do it.

14:29.972 --> 14:31.373
Can you notarize something
for me right now?

14:31.493 --> 14:32.583
Alright, here's the deal.

14:32.878 --> 14:35.059
7$. I only take singles.
You in or out?

14:35.340 --> 14:36.578
- Okay.
- Alright.

14:37.028 --> 14:39.194
- Step into my office.
- It's by the bathroom?

14:39.454 --> 14:40.805
It is the bathroom, honey.

14:42.096 --> 14:45.426
- It is official.
- It's a fine number, but this, my friend,

14:45.670 --> 14:47.259
is official.

14:47.379 --> 14:48.638
What?

14:48.758 --> 14:51.789
I, Pete Eckhart will run
in the Chi-Town marathon.

14:51.909 --> 14:54.444
- Notarized.
- Wow.

14:54.564 --> 14:56.143
This is impressive.

14:56.263 --> 14:59.955
This is a piece of paper with a stamp on it.
I have an official race ***.

15:00.075 --> 15:01.511
- Did you get it notarized?
- Hmm.

15:01.631 --> 15:02.846
Hmm.

15:02.913 --> 15:04.080
Don't need one.

15:04.148 --> 15:05.081
See you a little later.

15:05.149 --> 15:06.316
Okay.

15:06.384 --> 15:08.685
You don't need to get it stamped.

15:08.753 --> 15:09.853
Watch, boys.

15:09.920 --> 15:10.954
Official business.

15:11.022 --> 15:12.255
Hey, watch it, pal!

15:12.323 --> 15:13.456
I'll notarize you!

15:13.524 --> 15:15.859
I don't think he knows
what that word means?

15:15.926 --> 15:16.960
No idea. He has no idea.

15:17.028 --> 15:18.261
No.

15:18.329 --> 15:20.764
He's a professional, just like myself.
Ugh! Oh!

15:20.831 --> 15:21.865
Oh, God.

15:21.932 --> 15:24.267
Andre, the stretching in doors
and the bib... it just all smacks

15:24.335 --> 15:25.468
of so much desperation.

15:25.536 --> 15:26.703
Notarize!

15:26.771 --> 15:28.872
You were only supposed
to stamp the paper!

15:28.939 --> 15:29.873
You ruined my jeans.

15:29.940 --> 15:31.975
You're not getting your seven dollars.

15:32.043 --> 15:34.144
I threw the ass stamp in for free!

15:34.211 --> 15:35.145
Oh! Oh! Oh!

15:35.212 --> 15:37.113
Come on, we had a deal.

15:37.181 --> 15:38.114
Buddy. You all right?

15:38.182 --> 15:39.315
Oh! Oh! Taco! Oh!

15:39.383 --> 15:40.550
What is it?

15:40.618 --> 15:41.818
My toe... Oh.

15:41.886 --> 15:43.887
Your toe?

15:43.954 --> 15:44.888
Is it turf toe?

15:44.955 --> 15:45.889
Turf toe?

15:45.956 --> 15:48.625
Oh. Can I get some ice? Ugh!

15:50.695 --> 15:53.196
By the way, can you run a
marathon with turf toe?

15:53.264 --> 15:54.230
A what?

15:54.298 --> 15:55.231
A marathon.

15:55.299 --> 15:56.232
A what?

15:56.300 --> 15:57.367
A marathon.

16:03.026 --> 16:05.408
What? What do you want?

16:05.476 --> 16:06.910
Look, Taco, I need your help.

16:06.977 --> 16:10.980
That canotary at work froze me out.
I'm under a time crunch.

16:11.048 --> 16:13.416
Can you please notarize
these documents for me?

16:14.360 --> 16:16.920
I'm done with the rat race.
I'm retired.

16:16.987 --> 16:19.057
I'm gonna lay low
for a little while.

16:19.177 --> 16:20.605
I don't think you could lay any lower.

16:20.725 --> 16:22.186
My book's full.

16:23.113 --> 16:27.497
As I look at all these entries, uh...
it's all a blur.

16:27.565 --> 16:28.932
It's half full.

16:28.999 --> 16:31.267
Half full of days that
I can't remember.

16:31.335 --> 16:33.737
You've been doing it for a week.

16:33.804 --> 16:36.272
You'd get out of here if you
knew what was good for you.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.541
Go. Leave me alone.

16:38.609 --> 16:40.243
Taco?

16:41.000 --> 16:44.949
Look, would a gift certificate from Caesar
change your mind?

16:45.507 --> 16:47.439
You son of a bitch.

16:48.384 --> 16:52.260
Looks like this old ranch hand's
going for one last cattle drive.

16:53.653 --> 16:56.593
It's just a dick move telling people you're
gonna run a marathon and then not do it.

16:56.660 --> 16:58.189
I'm injured, okay?

16:58.309 --> 16:59.421
I have turf toe.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.206
You were the one who said
that wasn't even a real thing.

17:02.326 --> 17:04.499
Frank Gore and I both have it,
and we're both out this week.

17:04.618 --> 17:07.645
Yup, and somebody was smart enough
to pick up Frank Gore's backup.

17:07.765 --> 17:08.913
A toast.

17:09.032 --> 17:10.319
There you go.
What, no beer?

17:10.440 --> 17:11.704
No, I'm good with my SPUNK.

17:11.825 --> 17:14.115
- I think I'm addic7ed to it.
- You're addic7ed to SPUNK?

17:15.311 --> 17:16.818
I just hit the shit out of Sizzler.

17:16.938 --> 17:18.982
I have the strength of four
Salisburies, three sirloins and

17:19.049 --> 17:20.049
a gallon of root beer inside me.

17:20.117 --> 17:21.317
Let's notarize.

17:21.385 --> 17:22.385
All right!

17:22.453 --> 17:23.586
What's the case?

17:23.654 --> 17:25.821
BP v. Minority Gulf Fisherman.

17:25.942 --> 17:28.093
Please tell me that you're
not representing BP.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.261
Someone has to defend them

17:29.381 --> 17:32.157
against getting crushed
under the hill of the common man.

17:32.277 --> 17:33.352
So, what's BP?

17:33.472 --> 17:34.609
What's BP?

17:34.729 --> 17:35.861
The oil company people.

17:35.981 --> 17:36.766
Hey.

17:37.539 --> 17:40.003
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm great, do you want to talk?

17:40.070 --> 17:43.173
If you're looking for an apology,
you came to the wrong place.

17:43.240 --> 17:43.801
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

17:43.921 --> 17:45.489
No more Hutus and Tutsis?

17:45.609 --> 17:48.640
No. Frank Gore went down with
turf toe, I picked up his backup.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.474
You know who I picked
up and who I started?

17:50.594 --> 17:52.668
- Who?
- Third stringer Anthony Dixon.

17:53.157 --> 17:55.436
He's the one who's actually
going to be playing for Gore,

17:55.556 --> 17:57.989
and he's the one who's going
to be getting all the points.

17:58.931 --> 18:00.256
She's good.

18:00.324 --> 18:02.492
There is absolutely no
love in the league.

18:02.560 --> 18:04.932
This is my last job, you know.

18:05.052 --> 18:05.976
After this, I'm done.

18:06.096 --> 18:08.331
I'm gonna pass it all
on to you, Ruxin.

18:08.399 --> 18:10.233
- What?
- I'll give you my certificate.

18:10.353 --> 18:14.012
- Uh- Uh.
- My mariachi and my estampa.

18:14.132 --> 18:16.691
Your estampa?
What are you talking about, Taco?

18:16.811 --> 18:18.174
What the hell is going on over here?

18:18.242 --> 18:19.146
Twyla.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.473
- Hey.
- Oh, I see that you ran the marathon.

18:21.593 --> 18:22.415
Yes, I did.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.923
And now you're eating a big piece
of chocolate cake.

18:25.043 --> 18:27.533
- Oh, you're the canotary?
- No!!

18:27.653 --> 18:30.353
I don't know what he's talking about.

18:30.421 --> 18:32.989
What I want to know is why
these corporate documents are

18:33.057 --> 18:34.057
being reviewed by El Notario.

18:34.124 --> 18:35.291
What is El Notario?

18:35.359 --> 18:36.526
What is that?

18:36.594 --> 18:37.727
That's me.

18:37.795 --> 18:41.159
Look, this notary stamp is from Venezuela.

18:41.279 --> 18:44.043
- What?
- It's not even valid in the US.

18:44.163 --> 18:46.326
- What?
- The times, they are changing.

18:46.658 --> 18:50.344
No room in this *** world for an old school
venezuelan notario like myself.

18:51.265 --> 18:52.897
♪♪♪

18:53.150 --> 18:54.501
To your dreams?

18:54.621 --> 18:57.659
- Yeah, I don't speak Spanish.
- So, you ***

18:57.779 --> 18:59.175
- I huess I am.
- Mm-hmm.

18:59.295 --> 19:01.144
Well, I think Team Twila
is gonna get a little donation.

19:01.264 --> 19:02.481
What about a big donation?

19:02.601 --> 19:04.672
How about a big donation
and a big piece of cake?

19:04.792 --> 19:08.076
Yes, I'll have my cake and donation
too, thank you very much.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.901
This is cashmere, you tiny little monster.

19:11.021 --> 19:13.391
I am really enjoying being in the league.

19:13.511 --> 19:16.644
And it's so much fun watching the games when
you actually have something on the line.

19:16.764 --> 19:18.263
Yeah, so much fun.

19:18.383 --> 19:20.303
They didn't have a problem
getting Ellie over to ***?

19:20.423 --> 19:22.178
I thought you brought her to gymnastics.

19:22.298 --> 19:25.909
No, I brought her to gymnastics and
you were supposed to pick her up and...

19:26.029 --> 19:28.104
Oh my God...

19:29.422 --> 19:31.082
Parent fail.

19:31.202 --> 19:34.498
Whoo! Door from rush.
It is real.

19:34.618 --> 19:36.119
You did not run the marathon.

19:36.186 --> 19:37.954
Uh, yeah, I did. Look.

19:38.022 --> 19:42.425
I've got my official marathon number.
It's my number. You stole my number.

19:42.493 --> 19:44.527
You forfeited by faking an injury.

19:44.595 --> 19:45.762
Therefore, you lost the bet.

19:45.829 --> 19:46.963
Fork it up, come on.

19:47.031 --> 19:50.767
Why...
Oh, he's getting up, folks.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.135
He's getting... He's running!

19:52.202 --> 19:55.071
He's running! He...
Come on, 26.2.

First week, first win.

20:11.129 --> 20:13.752
- How did you know to pick up Andy Dixon?
 - I'm good.

20:13.872 --> 20:15.315
That really was a great
free agent pickup.

20:15.383 --> 20:16.316
You gonna talk dirty to me?

20:16.384 --> 20:17.617
Yeah.

20:17.685 --> 20:18.718
I love it.

20:18.786 --> 20:21.015
Shonn Greene... three
touchdowns for 28 points.

20:21.135 --> 20:24.856
Jay Feely... two... Oh......
5 0 yarders splitting the uprights.

20:25.109 --> 20:26.825
Oh! Wow! Mmm!

20:27.695 --> 20:28.728
How's it feel to lose?

20:28.796 --> 20:29.729
Mm, about 60% blood flow.

20:32.452 --> 20:34.253
70.

20:34.373 --> 20:38.428
- Next week, I am going to crush Andre.
- Andre? Ooh.

20:38.667 --> 20:39.417
Mm-hmm.

20:39.537 --> 20:40.299
30.

20:40.419 --> 20:41.059
Mmm.

20:41.179 --> 20:43.265
20. Oh, get the stick.
