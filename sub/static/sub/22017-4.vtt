00:21.420 --> 00:24.757

Computer, show me Starfleets
rendering of the seven signals.


00:24.791 --> 00:26.192

Spock drew these signals


00:26.225 --> 00:28.193

two months
before they appeared to us.


00:28.228 --> 00:29.562

Its damn near identical.


00:31.698 --> 00:33.466

BURNHAM:
Amanda?


00:33.500 --> 00:35.402

(whispers): I stole
Spocks medical file.


00:35.435 --> 00:37.469

Ive been waiting for an update
on my officer, Spock.


00:37.503 --> 00:39.371

Your guy is wanted for murder.


00:39.405 --> 00:41.473

Killed three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.


00:41.508 --> 00:43.810

AMANDA: I thought
that he had left it in the past,


00:43.843 --> 00:45.512

but its back.


00:45.545 --> 00:48.515

What is it?


00:45.545 --> 00:48.515

Your brother called it
the Red Angel.


00:48.548 --> 00:50.482

That vision changed him forever.


00:50.517 --> 00:52.218

It wasnt because of a vision.


00:52.252 --> 00:55.354

It was because of me.


00:52.252 --> 00:55.354

What did you do?


00:55.387 --> 00:56.356

I will find him.


00:56.389 --> 00:58.223

No.


00:58.258 --> 01:00.159

<i>I will.</i>


01:01.860 --> 01:03.429

Got it.


01:03.463 --> 01:04.763

TILLY:<i>After the dark matter hit me...</i>


01:04.798 --> 01:07.634

Its me.


01:04.798 --> 01:07.634

<i>...I started to see a ghost.</i>


01:07.667 --> 01:09.701

Her name was May,
but shes dead.


01:07.667 --> 01:09.701

Tilly.


01:09.736 --> 01:11.805

I am losing it, Michael.


01:09.736 --> 01:11.805

BURNHAM:
You dont need sickbay.


01:11.837 --> 01:13.673

<i>You need Stamets.</i>


01:11.837 --> 01:13.673

<i>We should have results</i>


01:13.706 --> 01:14.908

in one second.


01:13.706 --> 01:14.908

There he is.


01:14.941 --> 01:17.242

Thats the captain.
Thats where he flies.


01:17.277 --> 01:18.644

Just as I suspected.


01:18.677 --> 01:21.614

You are hosting a
eukaryotic organism.


01:18.677 --> 01:21.614

A fungus?


01:21.647 --> 01:23.817

This might hurt a bit.


01:25.784 --> 01:27.787

(grunts)


01:30.189 --> 01:32.558

Security breach by unknown
alien species in Engineering.


01:32.591 --> 01:35.694

Engage quarantine protocol
Alpha-Omega.


01:39.598 --> 01:41.700

Energize.


01:41.734 --> 01:42.902

Teleporter incoming.


01:56.382 --> 01:58.651

Captain.


01:56.382 --> 01:58.651

Welcome aboard


01:56.382 --> 01:58.651

<i>Discovery,
Number One.</i>


01:58.685 --> 02:01.320

The failures cascaded
through all our primaries.


02:01.353 --> 02:03.923

Helm, nav, both impulse
and warp drive. Chief Louvier


02:03.956 --> 02:05.891

has an engineering team
working round the clock.


02:05.924 --> 02:08.427

I dont think


02:05.924 --> 02:08.427

<i>Enterprise</i>


02:05.924 --> 02:08.427

will
ever have a chief engineer


02:08.461 --> 02:09.461

more in love with his ship.


02:09.496 --> 02:11.431

Apparently,<i>
Enterprise</i>


02:09.496 --> 02:11.431

is the only ship


02:11.463 --> 02:12.831

in the fleet
thats had any problems.


02:12.865 --> 02:13.932

You know, he warned me.


02:13.967 --> 02:15.568

The damn
holographic comm system.


02:15.602 --> 02:17.203

Tell Louvier to rip
out the entire system.


02:17.236 --> 02:18.538

From now on well communicate


02:18.570 --> 02:19.872

using good,
old-fashioned viewscreens.


02:19.906 --> 02:21.574

Truth is I never liked
the holograms.


02:21.608 --> 02:23.443

They look too much like ghosts.


02:23.475 --> 02:25.578

(chuckles)


02:23.475 --> 02:25.578

He told you Id say that.


02:25.611 --> 02:27.680

No. I told him.


02:27.713 --> 02:29.681

Cheeseburger. Fries.


02:29.716 --> 02:32.585

Habanero sauce.


02:29.716 --> 02:32.585

You want to order
some lighter fluid with that?


02:32.618 --> 02:33.586

That goes with the shake.


02:33.620 --> 02:35.989

Sorry to keep you in Spacedock.


02:36.021 --> 02:37.557

Ive made use of
the time, Captain.


02:37.590 --> 02:40.425

Youve been looking into
the allegations against Spock.


02:40.460 --> 02:42.728

Its hard to comprehend,
let alone believe,


02:42.762 --> 02:44.563

that he murdered three people


02:44.597 --> 02:47.300

at the psychiatric
facility on Starbase Five.


02:47.332 --> 02:48.334

Hows the crew taking it?


02:48.367 --> 02:49.769

They dont know the details.


02:49.801 --> 02:51.403

Only that hes in trouble.


02:53.338 --> 02:55.341

Theres something else.


02:55.375 --> 02:57.377

Tell me.


02:57.409 --> 03:01.614

Starfleets classified
his case Level One.


03:01.647 --> 03:03.983

Line officers dont usually
warrant that kind of scrutiny.


03:04.016 --> 03:06.718

Its unprecedented. Which is why
Ive done a little digging.


03:06.752 --> 03:07.920

Sanctioned?


03:07.954 --> 03:09.989

Better you dont know the answer
to that.


03:10.022 --> 03:12.324

Before I look at that,


03:12.358 --> 03:15.627

I need to know why you saw fit
to detour Federation protocols.


03:15.662 --> 03:19.331

Something about this
investigation isnt adding up.


03:19.365 --> 03:21.768

Im not letting him go
without a fight.


03:21.800 --> 03:24.002

As usual, we agree.


03:24.037 --> 03:26.538

MALE OFFICER (over comms):
Captain Pike to the ready room.


03:26.573 --> 03:29.609

Im late for a briefing.
Im glad you came.


03:29.641 --> 03:31.276

Im sorry you cant stay longer.


03:31.311 --> 03:33.045

Next time.


03:33.079 --> 03:34.747

Be careful, Captain.


03:34.781 --> 03:37.015

You, too, Number One.


03:43.656 --> 03:45.891

We should give it a name.


03:45.925 --> 03:47.694

(chuckles):
Other than May.


03:48.927 --> 03:51.930

I know it looks like a blob,


03:51.965 --> 03:54.300

but this is one of the most
sophisticated life-forms


03:54.334 --> 03:55.701

Ive ever encountered.


03:55.735 --> 03:58.771

It has sentience,
intention.


03:58.805 --> 04:02.074

Tilly, the mycelial network
doesnt just connect life.


04:02.108 --> 04:03.943

It contains it.


04:03.977 --> 04:05.478

Its an incubator.


04:05.510 --> 04:08.715

You mean, like,
um... like a home?


04:13.586 --> 04:17.055

Ive been wondering why
it appeared to me as May,


04:17.089 --> 04:18.757

which got me thinking
about the real May


04:18.790 --> 04:20.726

that I met when I was, um, 14.


04:22.127 --> 04:25.430

I was, um... I was a weird kid.


04:25.464 --> 04:27.834

(chuckles): You know?
Like, not a lot of friends


04:27.867 --> 04:31.838

and nobody who really
believed in me, including me.


04:31.870 --> 04:35.675

But... she did.


04:35.707 --> 04:40.112

She wanted to connect to
me, and she tried so hard.


04:40.146 --> 04:41.947

But I dont really think


04:41.980 --> 04:43.716

I was the friend to
her that she needed.


04:43.750 --> 04:45.418

Im certain


04:45.451 --> 04:47.853

you were much kinder than
you give yourself credit for.


04:47.887 --> 04:50.122

You always are.


04:50.156 --> 04:52.692

Thank you, but...


04:52.725 --> 04:56.062

I didnt even know she died.


04:56.095 --> 04:57.930

I feel like I took her
for granted.


04:57.963 --> 05:00.833

That girl
who thought I was special.


05:01.901 --> 05:03.002

Oh!


05:06.906 --> 05:10.043

Ive cross-referenced
what were calling the Red Angel


05:10.076 --> 05:11.476

with all known winged


05:11.511 --> 05:13.146

and avian life-forms
in the Federation.


05:13.178 --> 05:14.613

So far, Ive found nothing.


05:14.646 --> 05:15.781

(whirring)


05:15.814 --> 05:17.783

Sorry.


05:17.817 --> 05:20.620

The universal translator
sometimes has trouble


05:20.653 --> 05:23.021

reconfiguring my lingual
clicks and pops.


05:23.055 --> 05:26.492

My answer to you was, "Nothing
in the known universe."


05:26.526 --> 05:28.494

Which might suggest
its not a species.


05:28.528 --> 05:31.163

Maybe one of a kind.


05:28.528 --> 05:31.163

A mutation.


05:31.197 --> 05:33.399

Well, whatever it is,
figuring out how its connected


05:33.432 --> 05:35.668

to these signals
will help us identify it.


05:35.701 --> 05:37.937

If only we knew what it needs.


05:39.204 --> 05:41.641

Commander Nhan, USS


05:39.204 --> 05:41.641

<i>Enterprise.</i>


05:41.673 --> 05:42.774

Glad to be here.


05:42.808 --> 05:44.177

Welcome back aboard.


05:42.808 --> 05:44.177

(sniffles)


05:44.209 --> 05:45.778

Could you pass the salt?


05:45.812 --> 05:47.646

Commander Saru,


05:47.680 --> 05:49.415

can you shed any light?


05:47.680 --> 05:49.415

(coughs)


05:49.449 --> 05:51.183

My apologies.


05:51.216 --> 05:53.185

I woke up this morning fighting


05:53.218 --> 05:54.920

an acute rhinovirus.


05:54.954 --> 05:56.055

So you have a cold.


05:56.088 --> 05:59.692

I had a cold last week,
which sucked.


06:00.892 --> 06:03.829

Saurian. Six nasal canals.


06:03.862 --> 06:05.831

It happens to the best of us,
Linus.


06:05.865 --> 06:07.834

Everyone to your stations.
Detmer, set a course


06:07.867 --> 06:10.502

for 108 mark four.
Maximum warp.


06:10.536 --> 06:11.637

Aye, sir.


06:10.536 --> 06:11.637

(Saru coughing)


06:11.670 --> 06:13.805

Mr. Saru, you look like hell.


06:13.839 --> 06:15.141

Youve been burning the candle
at both ends lately.


06:15.173 --> 06:16.442

Go get some rest.


06:16.475 --> 06:18.644

As you wish, sir.


06:18.677 --> 06:22.447

Burnham. A word.


06:22.481 --> 06:26.619

I understand your first officer
is on her way to Spacedock.


06:26.651 --> 06:28.620

Was her visit informative?


06:28.653 --> 06:30.122

Number One is very resourceful.


06:30.156 --> 06:32.992

People have a tendency
to end up owing her favors.


06:33.024 --> 06:35.093

She uncovered


06:35.127 --> 06:37.497

some classified information


06:37.529 --> 06:38.430

on Starbase Five.


06:38.463 --> 06:41.000

That is the warp signature
of the shuttle


06:41.033 --> 06:43.168

that Spock stole
from the psychiatric facility.


06:43.201 --> 06:45.605

I put us on an intercept course.


06:45.637 --> 06:48.507

We should reach his position
in the next few hours.


06:53.045 --> 06:55.113

S-Sir,


06:55.148 --> 06:57.716

after everything
thats happened,


06:57.750 --> 07:01.521

I need to excuse myself
from seeing Spock.


07:01.553 --> 07:03.221

Not sure I follow.


07:03.255 --> 07:05.625

I dont want
to make things worse for him.


07:05.658 --> 07:10.262

Hes a fugitive,
whatever the circumstances.


07:10.295 --> 07:14.166

And as Amanda suggested...


07:14.199 --> 07:16.601

(sighs)
Im probably the last person


07:16.636 --> 07:19.271

who should insert themselves
into this problem.


07:19.305 --> 07:22.707

I disagree.


07:19.305 --> 07:22.707

He is lost, Captain.


07:22.742 --> 07:26.045

You are better suited
to help him.


07:27.747 --> 07:29.915

Ive thought this through.


07:29.949 --> 07:34.519

Please, trust me.


07:34.553 --> 07:37.523

My abiding trust in you


07:37.557 --> 07:40.026

doesnt eclipse
the mission at hand.


07:40.058 --> 07:41.927

Facing whatever happened
to Spock,


07:41.961 --> 07:44.129

its not gonna be easy
for any of us.


07:44.163 --> 07:48.067

Reaching him
has to be the priority.


07:53.639 --> 07:54.941

Detmer, status?


07:54.973 --> 07:56.641

Something has grabbed us
out of warp, sir.


07:56.675 --> 07:58.076

Speed dropping to sub-light.


07:58.110 --> 07:59.778

Helm going unresponsive.


07:58.110 --> 07:59.778

PIKE:
Shields up.


07:59.812 --> 08:01.012

Red alert. Owosekun,


08:01.047 --> 08:02.048

are we talking tractor beam?


08:02.081 --> 08:03.182

More powerful than that, sir.


08:03.216 --> 08:05.084

Im unable to raise shields.


08:05.117 --> 08:08.553

Preliminary analysis indicates
a multiphasic stasis field.


08:08.588 --> 08:10.021

Its disrupting
our shield harmonics.


08:10.055 --> 08:11.757

DETMER: Were at
a full stop, sir.


08:11.790 --> 08:14.026

Whatever has us,
w-were locked into place.


08:14.060 --> 08:15.761

Like a damn fly in a web.

COMPUTER:
Confirmed.


12:14.299 --> 12:15.801

Did it work?


12:15.835 --> 12:17.403

Yes. I can understand you.


12:17.436 --> 12:18.403

DETMER: I still cant
read my controls.


12:18.437 --> 12:21.139

I think this is Tau Cetian.


12:21.173 --> 12:23.509

Am I the only one who bothered
to learn a foreign language?


12:23.542 --> 12:25.443

I have localized


12:25.477 --> 12:27.846

the backup bridge translator.


12:27.879 --> 12:29.347

For the time being,


12:29.380 --> 12:32.084

everyone who speaks
Earth English can communicate.


12:32.118 --> 12:34.586

The rest of the crew and<i>
Discoverys</i>


12:32.118 --> 12:34.586

computer
are another matter.


12:34.620 --> 12:36.554

The bridge may be
temporarily fixed, but
the virus will continue


12:36.588 --> 12:37.889

spreading through
our comms system.


12:37.923 --> 12:39.591

I can try purging it


12:39.625 --> 12:41.025

from the translators
main interface.


12:41.059 --> 12:42.561

We have to be able to talk
to the computer


12:42.595 --> 12:44.296

and the rest of the crew
to have any chance


12:44.330 --> 12:45.597

of breaking free
from that sphere. Do it.


12:45.630 --> 12:46.599

Yes, sir.


12:46.631 --> 12:47.700

(coughing)


12:47.732 --> 12:50.568

Ill go. You should stay
and monitor bridge stations.


12:50.602 --> 12:53.505

(panting):
I have placed all systems
on... automatic.


12:53.538 --> 12:55.374

And given
our current circumstances,


12:55.407 --> 12:58.911

you will need a translator
just to operate the turbolift.


12:58.943 --> 13:01.080

Are you sure you can do this?


12:58.943 --> 13:01.080

We are wasting time.


13:02.648 --> 13:04.216

Weve run
a full diagnostic, Captain,


13:04.250 --> 13:06.317

and this section
remains unaffected by the virus.


13:06.351 --> 13:08.320

I will update you
if anything changes.


13:08.354 --> 13:09.955

PIKE:
Thank you, Ensign.


13:09.989 --> 13:11.524

If we cant fly this thing,
Commander,


13:11.557 --> 13:13.859

we may have to jump away.


13:13.893 --> 13:15.628

The spore drive
will be ready, sir.


13:15.660 --> 13:17.395

Bring the drive online,


13:17.428 --> 13:19.398

and then well couple
the shunts to me,


13:19.431 --> 13:21.634

in case weve got
to skedaddle.

"propulsive,"

A... farmer.


13:59.938 --> 14:03.308

Oh, please, let us know
what you think, because we care.


14:03.341 --> 14:05.177

You should.
Antimatter and dilithium


14:05.211 --> 14:08.214

might be old-school,
but they dont let you down.


14:08.246 --> 14:10.416

Why soar when you can crawl?


14:10.448 --> 14:12.350

You dont know me, Doc.
Im un-insultable.


14:12.384 --> 14:15.386

Especially by a guy
who thinks he can run a ship


14:15.421 --> 14:18.157

on mushrooms
that I pick off my pizza.


14:18.190 --> 14:20.024

Spores are clean, renewable.


14:20.058 --> 14:21.326

Yeah, do they come
with house dressing?


14:23.461 --> 14:25.331

Do you have any idea
how many planets


14:25.364 --> 14:27.432

have been ruined
by dilithium mining?


14:27.466 --> 14:29.168

How many battles
were fought


14:29.201 --> 14:31.302

to corner its supply?
Of course you dont.


14:31.336 --> 14:33.205

Youre one of those people
who never even consider it.


14:33.239 --> 14:36.274

And youre one of those people
that does the ha-ha jokey thing


14:36.307 --> 14:38.143

and then gets all huffy
and in high dudgeon


14:38.177 --> 14:40.178

when you cant think
of a comeback.


14:40.211 --> 14:41.447

Do you have gum?


14:41.480 --> 14:43.649

Grape. I...


14:43.682 --> 14:44.682

You know, it was only a
couple centuries ago that


14:44.716 --> 14:47.152

the Earth nearly choked
to death on pollution.


14:47.186 --> 14:49.989

Then we all woke up,
and within a generation,


14:50.022 --> 14:51.990

everything from a
truck to a toaster...


14:52.024 --> 14:53.125

Do you want...
Sorry. Sorry


14:53.158 --> 14:54.994

...was covered
in solar panels.


14:55.027 --> 14:57.663

Yesterdays solar panels
are todays fungi.


14:57.696 --> 14:59.331

Hmm.
I can fix stuff


14:59.365 --> 15:01.700

with duct tape,
if you want.


15:01.734 --> 15:04.003

Do you think May had anything
to do with the sphere?


15:04.035 --> 15:06.404

What a giant entity
from our universe


15:06.437 --> 15:09.107

and a mycelial species
from the network?


15:09.140 --> 15:10.375

Well, they have
as much in common


15:10.408 --> 15:12.177

as me and that grease monkey.


15:12.211 --> 15:14.212

I could fix that analogy
with duct tape, too.


15:19.284 --> 15:21.220

15:31.297 --> 15:33.231

The universal translator


15:34.700 --> 15:37.201

15:38.403 --> 15:42.274

15:42.307 --> 15:44.143

This is not just a cold.


15:44.176 --> 15:46.010

15:46.044 --> 15:48.379

No, it is not.

15:52.650 --> 15:55.687

(deep, increasing hum)


15:55.721 --> 15:56.754

Whats that hum?


15:56.788 --> 15:58.590

Get down!


16:06.365 --> 16:09.400

Okay, theres more
where that came from.


16:09.434 --> 16:11.470

Weve got a hundred-
giga-electron volts


16:11.503 --> 16:13.339

surging through
the local relays.


16:13.371 --> 16:14.673

Computers isolated
the compartment


16:14.706 --> 16:16.674

in order to contain the damage.


16:16.708 --> 16:18.744

Weve still got
our life support.


16:18.777 --> 16:20.745

Yeah, but...
it could kill us.


16:20.778 --> 16:24.216

If our oxygen ignites,
well cook like french fries.


16:24.249 --> 16:26.351

Well, we could divert
the power to act like a...


16:26.384 --> 16:28.386

a-a lightning arrestor.


16:26.384 --> 16:28.386

We could use
the door


16:28.419 --> 16:30.154

as a ground.


16:30.188 --> 16:32.624

Then the surge would
dissipate through the frame


16:32.658 --> 16:34.826

of the ship.
The question is,


16:34.860 --> 16:38.129

how do we conduct the surge
from there to there?


16:38.163 --> 16:40.099

No, a gas could,
once it ionizes.


16:40.131 --> 16:42.167

I infuse the spores
with an argon-xenon mixture


16:42.201 --> 16:43.769

to slow decay.


16:43.802 --> 16:45.770

We could link up
the canisters


16:45.803 --> 16:47.840

to contain the gas,
our version of a lightning rod.


16:47.873 --> 16:49.841

Thats actually
not a stupid idea.


16:49.875 --> 16:51.844

Its my version
of the house dressing,


16:51.876 --> 16:54.513

but it saves your life.
Huh.


16:54.546 --> 16:56.280

Bridge. What happened?


16:56.315 --> 16:57.415

Did the sphere fire on us?


16:57.448 --> 16:58.450

OWOSEKUN:
Negative.


16:58.484 --> 16:59.585

EPS conduits are overloading.


16:59.618 --> 17:00.586

Systems are going haywire.


17:00.619 --> 17:02.453

The virus is spreading.


17:02.488 --> 17:04.155

What is happening
to the ship?


17:04.189 --> 17:06.157

We... have to get
to the bridge.


17:04.189 --> 17:06.157

No, no, no, no, no.


17:06.191 --> 17:08.493

Right now
we got to get you to sickbay.


17:10.362 --> 17:11.462

Gas her up.


17:14.432 --> 17:16.468

(whooshing, beeping)


17:16.501 --> 17:19.671

Gas transference at 100%.


17:16.501 --> 17:19.671

Youre gonna do that manually?


17:19.704 --> 17:21.874

Uh, yeah,
cause obviously youre not.


17:21.906 --> 17:23.442

Flick the switch.


17:25.676 --> 17:27.445

(Reno screams)


17:25.676 --> 17:27.445

(power whirrs down)


17:28.446 --> 17:30.516

(power whirring up)


17:32.217 --> 17:34.185

Are you okay?


17:34.219 --> 17:35.721

I feel like
Ive been hit by lightning


17:35.753 --> 17:37.455

for the second time this week.


17:37.489 --> 17:39.625

Reno?


17:39.657 --> 17:42.493

Reno? Reno, are
you all right?


17:42.528 --> 17:43.895

Weird... dream.


17:43.929 --> 17:46.565

I was playing drums for Prince,


17:46.597 --> 17:48.433

and there were doves
and a parade.


17:48.467 --> 17:50.335

Okeydoke.


17:51.936 --> 17:54.173

Wait.


17:54.205 --> 17:55.473

Its gone.


17:55.507 --> 17:58.544

(clacking, screeching)


17:59.377 --> 18:00.546

(deep growling)


18:00.813 --> 18:01.779

Tilly!


18:02.713 --> 18:03.781

She wont let...


18:03.816 --> 18:04.883

she wont let go!


18:04.916 --> 18:05.851

She wont let go.


18:11.890 --> 18:13.592

(alarm blaring)


18:13.625 --> 18:17.162

(coughing)


18:17.195 --> 18:19.730

(coughing)


18:17.195 --> 18:19.730

Whats happening to him?


18:19.765 --> 18:21.799

Im hoping Dr.
Pollard can tell us.


18:21.834 --> 18:25.269

Well, comms is down, so I need
to see what the situation is


18:25.304 --> 18:26.939

in sickbay, anyway.


18:26.971 --> 18:28.440

POLLARD:
Triage plasma burns
on level one.


18:28.473 --> 18:30.209

Send non-critical
to sickbay two.


18:30.241 --> 18:31.210

PIKE:
Doctor.


18:31.242 --> 18:32.810

POLLARD:
Bring him here.


18:32.845 --> 18:35.948

(panting)


18:32.845 --> 18:35.948

Elevated heart rate,


18:35.980 --> 18:37.449

spiking adrenal levels,


18:37.482 --> 18:39.218

increased
neural activity.


18:39.250 --> 18:41.854

The pain would render the
average humanoid unconscious.


18:41.886 --> 18:44.189

(grunts)


18:44.222 --> 18:45.457

What do we do
about those?


18:45.490 --> 18:47.826

Nothing.
It is an effect of...


18:47.859 --> 18:49.595

my condition.


18:53.765 --> 18:55.433

Ocular discomfort?


18:55.467 --> 18:57.469

No. Kelpiens can see
far deeper


18:57.502 --> 18:59.605

into th-the light spectrum
than humans.


18:59.637 --> 19:01.839

I keep seeing flashes
of ultraviolet light,


19:01.874 --> 19:03.474

invisible to you, but...
quite the opposite


19:03.509 --> 19:04.843

for me.


19:03.509 --> 19:04.843

Are these symptoms


19:04.876 --> 19:06.345

common among Kelpiens?


19:06.377 --> 19:08.579

This is pointless.
And the ship is being


19:08.614 --> 19:10.949

further immobilized
as we waste time.


19:10.982 --> 19:13.417

There is no reason to believe
the sphere is benevolent.


19:13.451 --> 19:14.819

Now, please...


19:14.853 --> 19:15.653

Commander.


19:15.686 --> 19:18.557

Dr. Pollard is
trying to help you.


19:18.589 --> 19:20.459

(sighs)


19:21.692 --> 19:25.564

Yes. It is unique
to my people,


19:25.596 --> 19:27.766

and it is terminal.


19:32.371 --> 19:34.772

Are you certain?


19:34.806 --> 19:37.342

I have never been more certain
of anything in my life.


19:37.375 --> 19:38.676

When I awoke


19:38.710 --> 19:40.345

in discomfort this morning...


19:40.378 --> 19:41.712

(pants)


19:41.747 --> 19:45.683

I hoped it was just...
a passing cold.


19:45.717 --> 19:48.753

But now I have
to face the truth.


19:48.787 --> 19:51.455

I do not understand why...


19:51.490 --> 19:52.990

but I am beginning to think that


19:53.025 --> 19:54.960

the sphere is...
is triggering


19:54.992 --> 19:57.762

the Kelpien biological
process known as...


19:57.796 --> 19:59.998

<i>Vaharai.</i>


20:00.031 --> 20:02.768

It is the event that signals


20:02.800 --> 20:06.003

when Kelpiens are ready to be...


20:06.038 --> 20:10.308

culled for slaughter by...
the Baul,


20:10.342 --> 20:12.644

the predator species
on my homeworld


20:12.678 --> 20:13.845

of Kaminar.


20:13.878 --> 20:15.881

But there are
no Baul here.


20:15.913 --> 20:18.016

It does not matter.


20:18.049 --> 20:20.318

Kelpien ganglia only enflame


20:20.352 --> 20:24.855

in this manner...
as we near our end.


20:24.890 --> 20:26.525

I am a...


20:26.557 --> 20:28.727

a slave to my biology.


20:28.759 --> 20:31.797

We are not gonna let you die.


20:31.829 --> 20:34.298

There has to be something


20:34.333 --> 20:35.666

that we can do.


20:35.701 --> 20:37.469

There is not.


20:37.501 --> 20:39.971

Kelpiens
undergoing


20:37.501 --> 20:39.971

<i>Vaharai</i>


20:40.005 --> 20:42.773

either die in the culling


20:42.807 --> 20:46.744

or... are driven to madness
by the effects


20:46.778 --> 20:48.680

of


20:46.778 --> 20:48.680

<i>Vaharai.
Either way,</i>


20:48.713 --> 20:51.717

death is inevitable.


20:54.385 --> 20:56.587

STAMETS: The mycelial entity
has attached itself to Tilly.


20:56.622 --> 20:58.624

Were trying to free her.
Engineering to bridge.


20:59.657 --> 21:01.593

Engineering to bridge.
Come in.


21:01.626 --> 21:03.060

Comms are down.


21:03.095 --> 21:04.462

Along with most of the ship.


21:08.432 --> 21:10.402

TILLY:
Dont feel bad.


21:10.434 --> 21:13.070

I know you have to
keep me in quarantine.


21:13.105 --> 21:14.806

Or<i>us.</i>


21:14.839 --> 21:17.342

I feel a
little weird.


21:17.375 --> 21:19.076

(weakly):
I should...


21:19.111 --> 21:21.846

I should be terrified,
but Im not.


21:21.880 --> 21:24.950

May means me no harm.


21:24.982 --> 21:27.019

Are you able to see May again?


21:27.051 --> 21:29.587

How do you know this is benign?


21:29.621 --> 21:32.124

May was scary,
and she was clingy, and she,


21:32.156 --> 21:34.625

like, never shut up, but...


21:34.660 --> 21:36.494

she never hurt me.


21:36.528 --> 21:38.896

She said she had a plan for me.


21:38.930 --> 21:41.500

She said that I was
her only chance.


21:41.532 --> 21:43.634

Did you ever think
she was manipulating you?


21:43.669 --> 21:45.871

Thats what she said


21:43.669 --> 21:45.871

<i>you</i>


21:43.669 --> 21:45.871

were
doing-- she said that you...


21:45.903 --> 21:47.905

you were trying to
poison me against her.


21:47.939 --> 21:50.442

Okay, if that thing
wasnt freaking me out,


21:47.939 --> 21:50.442

<i>she</i>


21:47.939 --> 21:50.442

is.


21:50.474 --> 21:52.911

The blob seems to be secreting
a psilocybin hallucinogen


21:52.943 --> 21:54.613

to influence her emotions.


21:54.645 --> 21:55.579

RENO:
So youre saying


21:55.614 --> 21:56.647

shes on a bad trip?


21:56.682 --> 21:57.915

Or maybe its just trying


21:57.949 --> 22:00.451

to calm her down
so she wont be scared.


22:00.484 --> 22:02.653

Or so she wont fight back?


22:07.526 --> 22:10.528

BURNHAM:
If Saru thinks
that somehow the...


22:10.561 --> 22:13.597

the sphere
triggered


22:10.561 --> 22:13.597

<i>Vaharai,</i>


22:13.632 --> 22:15.834

maybe escaping its grip would
stop whats happening to him.


22:15.866 --> 22:17.068

The problem is
freeing ourselves


22:17.102 --> 22:18.737

before it
destroys the ship.


22:18.769 --> 22:20.872

If it wanted to destroy us,
why the slow attack?


22:20.905 --> 22:22.708

Its inefficient, right?


22:22.740 --> 22:24.442

It must need something.


22:24.476 --> 22:26.744

Its taking what it needs.
Without the computer,


22:26.778 --> 22:29.980

all our primary systems begin to
fail, including the warp core.


22:30.015 --> 22:32.483

The EPS grids unstable,
and its cutting off


22:32.517 --> 22:34.952

entire sections,
including Engineering.


22:34.986 --> 22:37.088

Life supports down to 60%,
but whos counting?


22:37.122 --> 22:40.424

It is not logical
for a virus to kill its host.


22:40.459 --> 22:43.161

Youre attaching a known medical
diagnosis to an unknown entity.


22:43.194 --> 22:44.829

SARU: There may
be a way to...


22:44.863 --> 22:46.030

slow the virus.


22:46.064 --> 22:48.599

If we can analyze
its properties,


22:48.633 --> 22:52.436

we may be able to develop
digital antibodies.


22:52.471 --> 22:54.638

That could give us back enough
control to break the ship free.


22:54.673 --> 22:55.574

SARU: In theory,
but it will be


22:55.606 --> 22:57.108

a slow process, like...


22:57.142 --> 22:59.711

army ants eating
a water buffalo.


22:59.744 --> 23:01.645

Im on it.
Going to the science lab.


23:01.680 --> 23:02.980

You will need my help.


23:03.013 --> 23:05.450

PIKE:
Saru, Commander Burnham
can handle this.


23:05.483 --> 23:08.185

Theres no reason to risk
your health any further.


23:05.483 --> 23:08.185

I...


23:08.220 --> 23:10.756

am dying, Captain...


23:10.788 --> 23:14.492

but I am most
certainly not... dead.


23:21.031 --> 23:22.733

(coughs)
The antibodies


23:22.768 --> 23:25.103

are s-slowing
the viruss progress.


23:25.136 --> 23:28.773

Life support at 47%.


23:31.843 --> 23:34.813

You are wondering
why I kept this from you.


23:39.151 --> 23:41.787

You dont have
to bear it alone.


23:43.954 --> 23:45.757

How...


23:45.790 --> 23:47.992

do I explain...


23:48.026 --> 23:50.228

to the woman
who has fought


23:50.261 --> 23:54.231

over and over for the right
to take her next breath


23:54.266 --> 23:59.171

that I come from a race
that submits?


23:59.203 --> 24:01.205

Im your friend.


24:03.240 --> 24:06.144

There will never be
judgment between us.


24:06.178 --> 24:08.579

Well, to my shame...


24:08.613 --> 24:10.848

hiding is my nature.


24:14.653 --> 24:16.954

I have learned
multiple languages,


24:16.988 --> 24:19.523

yet never shared my own,


24:19.557 --> 24:22.961

fearful of revealing
my own...


24:22.993 --> 24:25.063

alienness.


24:27.598 --> 24:28.933

May I...


24:28.967 --> 24:30.935

request a favor?


24:30.969 --> 24:32.971

Of course.


24:33.003 --> 24:34.940

Anything.


24:34.972 --> 24:38.676

I have kept
detailed personal logs


24:38.710 --> 24:41.112

since joining Starfleet.


24:41.145 --> 24:43.682

I would ask you...


24:43.714 --> 24:46.951

to officially catalogue them,
so that when...


24:46.984 --> 24:51.222

General Order 1 no longer
applies to the Kelpiens...


24:51.256 --> 24:54.226

they will know
a journey like mine...


24:54.259 --> 24:55.861

is possible.


24:55.894 --> 24:58.630

(voice breaks):
It would be my privilege.


25:01.031 --> 25:04.001

Did you record your life
before Starfleet?


25:04.035 --> 25:06.837

Uh, you might say
my life began


25:06.872 --> 25:10.875

when I was granted refugee
status by the Federation.


25:10.909 --> 25:14.045

While being processed
at Starbase Seven...


25:14.078 --> 25:16.213

(sighs)


25:16.248 --> 25:18.950

...I saw for the first time


25:18.983 --> 25:23.688

life-forms
from across the universe,


25:23.721 --> 25:26.357

some with less than I had,


25:26.391 --> 25:29.794

yet, with a dream


25:29.827 --> 25:31.896

of something better.


25:33.898 --> 25:35.901

I listened.


25:38.269 --> 25:41.972

Every story I heard...
(sniffles)


25:42.007 --> 25:45.309

...created... a space inside me


25:45.343 --> 25:48.980

to feel more, to...


25:49.013 --> 25:51.715

<i>love</i>


25:49.013 --> 25:51.715

more.


25:53.285 --> 25:56.288

I joined Starfleet


25:56.320 --> 25:58.757

to help those in need


25:58.789 --> 26:01.826

the way I was helped.


26:01.859 --> 26:03.862

You are...


26:03.894 --> 26:05.997

the most


26:03.894 --> 26:05.997

<i>empathic</i>


26:03.894 --> 26:05.997

soul...


26:06.030 --> 26:08.032

I know.


26:10.801 --> 26:13.738

There was just one...


26:13.771 --> 26:16.607

painful caveat to my signing up.


26:21.078 --> 26:23.048

(voice breaking):
I could never return home.


26:23.080 --> 26:25.049

Why?
(groans softly)


26:25.083 --> 26:27.051

Oh.


26:27.085 --> 26:29.054

More flashes
of ultraviolet light.


26:29.086 --> 26:31.423

They are... growing


26:31.455 --> 26:34.058

in... strength and frequency.


26:34.092 --> 26:36.427

Ill get something from sickbay.


26:34.092 --> 26:36.427

No. No.


26:36.461 --> 26:39.330

I will be fine.


26:39.364 --> 26:41.066

The captain asked you


26:41.098 --> 26:43.335

to return to the bridge
as soon as possible.


26:43.367 --> 26:45.971

I can continue
the work here.


26:47.172 --> 26:49.207

OWOSEKUN: Spock is still
at maximum warp, Captain.


26:49.240 --> 26:51.076

If were stuck here much longer,
were going to lose him.


26:51.108 --> 26:52.076

Reallocate power
from the transporters


26:52.109 --> 26:53.411

to long-range sensors.


26:53.444 --> 26:54.913

I dont want to lose contact
with his shuttle.


26:54.945 --> 26:56.681

Even with sensors at max,
we wont be able


26:56.714 --> 26:58.682

to track him for much longer.


26:56.714 --> 26:58.682

Contact Engineering.


26:58.717 --> 27:00.684

See if they can reroute
impulse power to the deflectors.


27:00.719 --> 27:02.453

If we can raise shields,
we might be able


27:02.487 --> 27:04.689

to disrupt the stasis field
just enough to break free.


27:04.722 --> 27:06.156

If so, can we
jump away?


27:06.191 --> 27:08.058

Negative, sir.
We dont have enough power


27:08.093 --> 27:09.861

to create the necessary
hull cavitation.


27:09.894 --> 27:11.695

Comms are still down
in Engineering, sir.


27:11.730 --> 27:12.998

Security protocols
are also malfunctioning,


27:13.030 --> 27:14.699

locking off parts
of the ship.


27:14.732 --> 27:16.000

How are we doing, Commander?


27:16.034 --> 27:17.368

The digital antibodies
are doing their job,


27:17.402 --> 27:18.869

but progress is sluggish.


27:18.903 --> 27:20.704

Im running out of options.


27:20.739 --> 27:23.173

If we lose Spock, we lose
any chance of protecting him.


27:23.208 --> 27:25.175

Permission to go to Engineering.


27:25.210 --> 27:26.778

We cant talk to
them here, but maybe


27:26.810 --> 27:28.179

I can help them
get power to shields.


27:28.212 --> 27:29.748

Permission granted.


27:31.016 --> 27:33.751

(mycelial creature squealing
softly)


27:37.288 --> 27:39.723

(Tilly panting)


27:37.288 --> 27:39.723

(buttons buzz)


27:39.758 --> 27:41.859

Whats wrong?


27:39.758 --> 27:41.859

The doors wont open,


27:41.893 --> 27:45.195

and that thing reattached
itself to Tilly.


27:41.893 --> 27:45.195

Can you detach it?


27:45.230 --> 27:47.731

I could cut it off. She wouldnt
even lose a freckle.


27:47.766 --> 27:49.134

Bad idea.


27:49.166 --> 27:52.069

If its a symbiote,
removing it might kill her.


27:52.103 --> 27:53.771

Well, thanks for stopping by.


27:53.805 --> 27:56.141

I came to see if we can find a
way to boost power to shields.


27:56.173 --> 27:57.409

No. With the systems
fluctuating,


27:57.442 --> 27:58.910

this section is partitioned off.


27:58.942 --> 28:00.211

We cant get to the warp core.


28:00.244 --> 28:01.913

Michael...


28:01.945 --> 28:04.115

(loud, gasping breathing)


28:06.451 --> 28:09.253

I feel really tired.


28:09.287 --> 28:10.288

What is happening?


28:10.320 --> 28:11.455

That blob is sending her


28:11.489 --> 28:12.923

in and out of consciousness.


28:12.957 --> 28:14.425

Why is it doing that to her?


28:14.459 --> 28:16.861

Its not like we can ask it.


28:17.327 --> 28:18.930

Actually, we can.


28:20.565 --> 28:22.133

This is a harmonic interface.


28:22.166 --> 28:24.035

It-it links my neurons
to the mycelial network.


28:24.068 --> 28:25.804

With modification,


28:25.836 --> 28:28.472

it could link May to Tillys
central nervous system.


28:28.506 --> 28:31.041

Let May speak
using Tillys mouth.


28:31.076 --> 28:33.177

Wait. What did you say?


28:33.211 --> 28:34.511

Were gonna talk to it.


28:34.546 --> 28:36.480

We need it to tell
us what it wants.


28:36.513 --> 28:38.282

So do we.


28:38.316 --> 28:40.551

The sphere-- its been trying
to tell us something,


28:40.585 --> 28:42.519

and we havent been listening.


28:42.554 --> 28:44.288

Well, damn, woman, go!


28:42.554 --> 28:44.288

We got her.


28:45.856 --> 28:47.325

Saru,


28:47.357 --> 28:49.827

could the sphere be
trying to talk to us?


28:49.861 --> 28:52.797

Using the virus as a way
to make first contact?


28:57.201 --> 28:59.471

(oscillating shriek playing)


29:01.205 --> 29:05.175

Yeah. Yes, of course.
Ive been so blind.


29:08.378 --> 29:11.516

The ultraviolet wavelengths
are repeating, like...


29:11.548 --> 29:13.250

like letters would in...


29:13.284 --> 29:15.385

in a sentence...
everywhere.


29:15.420 --> 29:17.989

Okay, Saru. Saru, stop.
Youre hurting yourself.


29:15.420 --> 29:17.989

(coughing)


29:18.021 --> 29:19.891

No, no. No.


29:19.923 --> 29:21.992

You called me
an "empathic soul,"


29:22.026 --> 29:23.894

and it is true.
My ganglia


29:23.928 --> 29:26.096

respond to shifts
in my environment,


29:26.131 --> 29:27.531

like an early-warning system.


29:27.565 --> 29:29.299

So it is... it is no coincidence


29:29.334 --> 29:33.137

that I started feeling sick
just before...


29:33.171 --> 29:35.105

the sphere engaged us.


29:35.140 --> 29:37.142

Why would...?


29:35.140 --> 29:37.142

I know what it is trying to say.


29:37.174 --> 29:39.576

Not first contact, Burnham.


29:39.611 --> 29:42.046

<i>Last</i>


29:39.611 --> 29:42.046

contact.


29:42.079 --> 29:45.150

I think it came to us to die.


29:52.523 --> 29:54.459

(loud whooshing)


29:54.491 --> 29:56.361

May?


29:56.394 --> 29:57.929

Still me.


29:57.961 --> 29:59.230

RENO:
Signals piss-poor.


29:59.263 --> 30:00.431

We need to
amplify it.


30:00.464 --> 30:01.332

Cortical implant.


30:01.365 --> 30:04.301

What, youre talking
about trepanation?


30:04.335 --> 30:06.971

Drilling a hole in her skull?
Yeah.


30:07.005 --> 30:09.073

Are you gonna fix her up
with duct tape after?


30:09.106 --> 30:11.209

Maybe.
Commander?


30:11.241 --> 30:12.277

I think shes right.


30:14.345 --> 30:16.247

And I think you think that, too.


30:16.280 --> 30:18.383

Then we do this together.


30:18.415 --> 30:21.352

This is all I had
laying around.


30:21.385 --> 30:24.087

Please tell me
you have a laser scalpel.


30:24.122 --> 30:25.990

No. Were gonna do this
old-school.


30:26.023 --> 30:27.491

We need to sterilize
that drill bit.


30:27.525 --> 30:29.527

First aid kits over there.


30:37.101 --> 30:38.403

I was able
to raise shields.


30:38.435 --> 30:39.671

Weve gained some
ground, but were still


30:39.703 --> 30:41.138

being held by
the stasis field.


30:41.172 --> 30:42.941

Power levels coming
and going, Captain.


30:42.973 --> 30:44.942

Security reports two dozen crew
still trapped below deck.


30:44.976 --> 30:46.544

Life support failing.


30:46.577 --> 30:49.279

Im reading an energy buildup
from inside the sphere.


30:49.314 --> 30:51.648

Spiking 10,000 degrees
Kelvin and rising.


30:51.682 --> 30:52.983

Is it powering up weapons?


30:53.017 --> 30:54.652

Reading no
identifiable weapons,


30:54.685 --> 30:57.221

but its internal temperature
is now 20,000 degrees Kelvin.


30:57.255 --> 30:59.958

Divert all non-essential power
to weapons.


30:59.990 --> 31:01.659

Lock on that things
radial axis and prepare


31:01.692 --> 31:03.361

to fire photon torpedoes
on my order.


31:03.394 --> 31:04.962

Aye, sir. Arming torpedoes.


31:04.996 --> 31:06.998

SARU: Captain,
hold your fire.


31:07.030 --> 31:09.166

I do not believe
the sphere means us any harm.


31:09.200 --> 31:10.468

All evidence to the contrary.


31:10.500 --> 31:11.669

That things about
to destroy us.


31:11.702 --> 31:13.238

Its not destroying
us, Captain.


31:13.270 --> 31:15.006

Its trying to
send us a message.


31:15.038 --> 31:17.040

We received its message.
Im about to send our reply.


31:17.075 --> 31:21.246

Captain, what if


31:17.075 --> 31:21.246

<i>Vaharai,
my death process,</i>


31:21.278 --> 31:24.382

was triggered because
the sphere is also dying?


31:27.285 --> 31:29.453

You want to run that
by me again?


31:29.487 --> 31:31.189

We Kelpiens have
a defining trait


31:31.221 --> 31:34.459

hard-wired into our DNA:
empathy.


31:34.491 --> 31:37.327

I can feel the sphere
reaching out,


31:37.362 --> 31:39.596

trying to share something
before it expires.


31:39.631 --> 31:42.634

Sir, I trust Sarus feelings
implicitly.


31:42.666 --> 31:45.369

That sphere didnt
come to attack us.


31:42.666 --> 31:45.369

SARU: Captain,


31:45.403 --> 31:47.638

I believe I have discerned
its means of communication.


31:47.672 --> 31:51.009

Detmer,
status on Spocks shuttle?


31:51.041 --> 31:53.677

Exits our sensor range
in six minutes.


31:53.711 --> 31:55.512

Once we lose his
warp signature,


31:55.546 --> 31:57.347

we wont be able
to reacquire it.


31:55.546 --> 31:57.347

Set an intercept course.


31:57.382 --> 31:59.049

I want us hauling ass
the second we break free.


31:59.083 --> 32:00.518

Aye, sir.


32:00.550 --> 32:01.653

Keep talking
and make it fast.


32:01.685 --> 32:03.453

What if the sphere


32:03.488 --> 32:06.257

was not attacking
our universal translator,


32:06.290 --> 32:09.259

but attempting
to teach us


32:06.290 --> 32:09.259

<i>its</i>


32:06.290 --> 32:09.259

language


32:09.294 --> 32:11.328

because it wants
to be remembered,


32:11.362 --> 32:13.463

to preserve its history


32:13.498 --> 32:15.199

using


32:13.498 --> 32:15.199

<i>Discovery,</i>


32:15.232 --> 32:18.269

but it cannot unless
we power down and let it in?


32:18.303 --> 32:21.005

That thing snatched us out of
warp and almost gutted the ship.


32:21.038 --> 32:22.339

What if we lower shields,


32:22.373 --> 32:23.740

and thats exactly what it needs
to end us?


32:23.775 --> 32:26.443

(Saru panting)


32:26.477 --> 32:29.614

Computer, adjust
viewscreen display


32:29.646 --> 32:32.482

to ultraviolet.


32:29.646 --> 32:32.482

(computer trills)


32:32.517 --> 32:34.685

That is the light pattern
I have been seeing


32:34.719 --> 32:37.020

everywhere,
repeating again


32:37.055 --> 32:40.625

and again, generated
by the spheres virus.


32:40.657 --> 32:42.759

Computer, run the light pattern


32:42.794 --> 32:45.462

through the universal
translator.


32:45.496 --> 32:47.632

Captain, I believe
we are looking


32:47.664 --> 32:49.334

at a multitude
of languages


32:49.366 --> 32:52.603

so advanced,
and knowledge so vast


32:52.636 --> 32:55.173

that it simply
overloaded our system.


32:55.205 --> 32:57.508

This sphere is
100,000 years old.


32:57.541 --> 33:00.778

Imagine what it knows,
what its seen.


33:00.811 --> 33:02.346

Captain, this falls
under


33:00.811 --> 33:02.346

<i>Discoverys</i>


33:02.380 --> 33:03.647

original mission
statement


33:03.681 --> 33:05.249

as a science vessel.


33:18.695 --> 33:20.698

STAMETS:
Well, Ill be.


33:20.731 --> 33:22.200

An amplified cortical implant.


33:29.240 --> 33:31.241

33:32.576 --> 33:34.545

Whats your favorite song?


33:34.578 --> 33:36.480

What?


33:36.513 --> 33:39.450

Your favorite song--
sing it for me.


33:39.483 --> 33:41.486

(hums softly)


33:43.855 --> 33:48.291

♪ Though Im past
one hundred thousand miles ♪


33:48.326 --> 33:52.563

33:52.596 --> 33:59.336

34:00.738 --> 34:03.875

♪ Tell my wife

34:03.907 --> 34:06.644

♪ She knows.


34:06.676 --> 34:08.713

(high-pitched whirring,
Tilly whimpers loudly)


34:08.746 --> 34:10.782

(gasps, sighs)


34:10.815 --> 34:12.817

(panting)


34:15.519 --> 34:17.621

(soft whirr)


34:17.655 --> 34:20.224

(panting loudly)


34:27.164 --> 34:29.166

May?


34:31.635 --> 34:34.371

(in Mays voice):
You wanted to talk to me?


34:34.405 --> 34:35.840

Here I am.


34:35.873 --> 34:38.643

What do you want?
Who are you?


34:38.675 --> 34:41.679

Im from a species
known as the JahSepp.


34:41.711 --> 34:45.315

We lived harmoniously until an
alien intruder began to arrive


34:45.349 --> 34:47.851

at random intervals,


34:47.885 --> 34:50.688

ravaging our ecosystem
irreparably.


34:50.721 --> 34:53.458

So, you came for help
to rid your species


34:53.490 --> 34:55.358

of a destructive alien presence?


34:55.393 --> 34:57.461

<i>You</i>


34:55.393 --> 34:57.461

are the destructive
alien presence.


34:57.494 --> 35:01.132

The-the... the jumps?


35:02.632 --> 35:04.601

<i>Discoverys</i>


35:02.632 --> 35:04.601

jumps?


35:04.635 --> 35:07.871

I broke through the
confines of the network


35:07.905 --> 35:09.840

to reach you,
at great risk.


35:09.873 --> 35:11.641

Risk? You infected
my friend.


35:11.675 --> 35:13.911

You dont belong
inside of her.


35:13.945 --> 35:15.913

You fly the ship from within
the cube, I can reach you.


35:15.947 --> 35:18.782

In Tilly, I found the memory
of May Ahearn, someone I knew


35:18.815 --> 35:21.351

shed be sympathetic to,
if given a second chance.


35:21.385 --> 35:23.554

Once she trusted May,
I planned to persuade her


35:23.588 --> 35:25.389

to deliver my
message to you.


35:25.422 --> 35:28.358

Oh, I can only ask
for your forgiveness.


35:28.391 --> 35:29.827

I knew better.


35:29.860 --> 35:31.695

I


35:29.860 --> 35:31.695

<i>know</i>


35:29.860 --> 35:31.695

better.


35:31.728 --> 35:34.699

Ill do whatever it takes
to fix this.


35:34.731 --> 35:36.701

All I ask is
that you let Tilly go.


35:36.733 --> 35:37.835

I cant.


35:37.869 --> 35:39.670

I have other plans for her.


35:39.704 --> 35:41.905

(screeches)


35:41.938 --> 35:43.974

Wrong!


35:41.938 --> 35:43.974

Oh. No!


35:44.007 --> 35:46.543

(yelling)


35:46.577 --> 35:47.711

Tilly!


35:47.744 --> 35:49.313

The spheres


35:49.347 --> 35:50.681

internal temperature
is approaching


35:50.715 --> 35:52.682

ten-to-the-sixth-power Kelvin
and rising.


35:52.717 --> 35:54.351

Our weapons will just
disintegrate in that heat.


35:54.385 --> 35:55.686

Solar temperatures.


35:55.719 --> 35:57.487

A sign of core collapse.


35:57.521 --> 36:00.224

Captain, if we are correct,


36:00.257 --> 36:02.994

once the transmission is
complete, the sphere can die


36:03.027 --> 36:05.695

knowing that it will live on
after it is gone.


36:05.730 --> 36:09.567

We can choose to fulfill
our part in its destiny,


36:09.599 --> 36:14.771

or simply let it fade away
unremembered.


36:14.804 --> 36:17.240

Spocks shuttle is almost
out of sensor range, sir.


36:18.409 --> 36:20.644

Prepare to lower shields.


36:23.280 --> 36:25.248

If this goes south,
overload the warp core


36:25.282 --> 36:27.385

and eject it at the sphere
on my command.


36:27.418 --> 36:29.554

Even at half the distance,
the blast will decimate it.


36:29.586 --> 36:31.822

When it lets go, we divert
all power to shields


36:31.856 --> 36:33.724

and try to ride the shock wave
to a safe distance.


36:33.757 --> 36:36.027

Assuming it doesnt
vaporize us first.


36:36.059 --> 36:37.695

If theres even half a
chance youre correct,


36:37.728 --> 36:40.530

Im bound by my
oath and conscience


36:40.565 --> 36:42.666

not to let it
vanish forever.


36:42.699 --> 36:44.302

Commanders,
take your stations.


36:44.335 --> 36:46.971

Ill follow your lead.


36:47.003 --> 36:49.706

Lieutenant Detmer,
lower shields.


36:49.739 --> 36:51.375

Aye, sir. Shields down.


36:51.409 --> 36:53.376

(whooshing)


36:53.411 --> 36:55.413

(rumbling and crackling)


36:58.081 --> 37:00.318

SARU:
Bryce,


37:00.351 --> 37:02.353

all channels open.
Owosekun,


37:02.385 --> 37:04.855

divert all computing
resources to Communications.


37:04.889 --> 37:07.692

Yes, Commander.
Here goes nothing.


37:09.025 --> 37:11.929

(power whirring down)


37:19.836 --> 37:21.639

Transmission is downloading.


37:21.672 --> 37:23.039

All library computers


37:23.074 --> 37:24.809

are processing
at 20% above maximum.


37:24.842 --> 37:26.943

Whatever the sphere is saying,
were getting all of it.


37:26.978 --> 37:28.813

How long until it blows?


37:26.978 --> 37:28.813

Seconds. Power


37:28.846 --> 37:30.947

and energy levels
are off the chart.


37:30.981 --> 37:32.682

Detmer, can you put enough
distance between us in time?


37:32.717 --> 37:35.018

Negative, sir. Were still being
locked by the stasis field.


37:35.052 --> 37:37.355

Transmission complete.


37:35.052 --> 37:37.355

Detmer, eject the warp core.


37:37.387 --> 37:38.956

Computer controls
not responding, sir.


37:38.989 --> 37:39.956

Detonation confirmed.


37:39.990 --> 37:41.559

Hard astern. Full impulse now.


37:48.699 --> 37:50.967

SARU:
Ah.


37:51.001 --> 37:53.838

It is so beautiful.


37:53.871 --> 37:57.041

The light is almost like...
music.


37:57.074 --> 37:59.844

Yes, it is.


37:59.876 --> 38:02.880

Im at a loss as to how
were still alive to see it.


38:04.849 --> 38:07.083

The spheres stasis field
reversed polarity


38:07.117 --> 38:09.987

a nanosecond
before detonation...


38:10.021 --> 38:13.356

and pushed us clear.


38:13.391 --> 38:16.027

Its final act was to save us


38:16.059 --> 38:18.496

so we could tell its story.


38:24.934 --> 38:26.369

Hand me the damn torch.


38:31.409 --> 38:32.376

(both grunt)


38:34.545 --> 38:37.014

(Tilly gasping)


38:37.047 --> 38:39.083

(whimpering)


38:39.115 --> 38:40.617

Tilly.


38:40.650 --> 38:41.751

Breathe. Breathe, Tilly.


38:40.650 --> 38:41.751

(hyperventilating)


38:41.786 --> 38:42.820

Breathe.


38:42.853 --> 38:44.889

Breathe, breathe. Slow it down.


38:44.922 --> 38:46.657

Breathe. Come on, youre okay.


38:46.690 --> 38:49.492

Youre still you.


38:49.527 --> 38:50.894

(hyperventilating)


38:49.527 --> 38:50.894

Tilly.


38:50.927 --> 38:53.898

Slow. Shh.


38:53.931 --> 38:55.900

(over comms):
Stamets to Burnham.
We got Tilly.


38:55.932 --> 38:57.867

Shes okay.


38:59.003 --> 39:00.804

(exhales)


39:02.572 --> 39:03.574

(sighs)


39:13.751 --> 39:16.152

Now it is my turn.


39:16.186 --> 39:18.822

Take me to my quarters, please.


39:20.824 --> 39:23.661

(breathing raggedly)


39:40.643 --> 39:42.579

(door whooshes open)


39:55.592 --> 39:58.596

I left home
with a handful of seeds.


40:00.630 --> 40:02.666

Is this from your homeworld?


40:02.699 --> 40:06.003

It is the blossom
that marks the...


40:06.036 --> 40:09.005

the passing of seasons
on Kaminar.


40:11.509 --> 40:15.079

Somewhere along the way,
I... I lost who I was.


40:15.112 --> 40:17.981

So focused on being


40:18.014 --> 40:21.184

the best Kelpien in Starfleet.


40:21.217 --> 40:24.655

Defined by my rank


40:24.688 --> 40:26.690

and uniform...


40:28.626 --> 40:30.894

...until that is all I became.


40:35.298 --> 40:37.768

You are wrong.


40:37.802 --> 40:39.769

Look at what
youve achieved.


40:39.804 --> 40:43.507

You found yourself
among the stars.


40:43.541 --> 40:46.076

You found your bravery.


40:46.110 --> 40:48.846

Your strength.


40:48.878 --> 40:51.581

Youve saved so
many lives, Saru.


40:53.050 --> 40:55.686

Including mine.


40:59.657 --> 41:02.592

(breathing raggedly)


41:06.630 --> 41:08.632

It is time.


41:12.902 --> 41:17.041

In that first drawer,
you will find a Kelpien knife,


41:17.074 --> 41:21.679

a keepsake I use
to prune my flowers.


41:35.326 --> 41:37.293

I need you


41:37.327 --> 41:41.065

to... to sever my ganglia


41:41.097 --> 41:43.032

and end my suffering.


41:43.067 --> 41:44.702

I need your help


41:44.735 --> 41:47.637

so that I can die now,


41:47.670 --> 41:50.206

peacefully,


41:50.240 --> 41:54.143

before the pain and madness
overtakes me.


41:56.213 --> 41:58.215

(sniffles)


41:59.750 --> 42:01.751

(sighs)


42:02.820 --> 42:06.023

Thank you, Michael.


42:17.735 --> 42:19.335

(sobbing)


42:19.369 --> 42:22.373

Do we have to do this?


42:22.405 --> 42:26.210

Is it truly inevitable?


42:26.242 --> 42:29.679

I am sorry.


42:29.713 --> 42:32.215

(sobs)


42:32.248 --> 42:35.885

I know how hard
this is for you.


42:35.920 --> 42:38.922

How many people
youve already lost.


42:42.927 --> 42:46.697

I would do it myself, but...


42:46.730 --> 42:49.300

I am too weak.


42:57.340 --> 42:59.342

After all this time...


43:01.244 --> 43:05.715

...after everything that we
have been through together...


43:07.717 --> 43:10.119

...I realize now


43:10.153 --> 43:13.856

that you are my family, Saru.


43:14.891 --> 43:18.829

I feel the same...


43:18.862 --> 43:20.831

about you.


43:20.864 --> 43:24.335

You are the only one
who knows me.


43:25.902 --> 43:28.871

You replaced the sister I had
on Kaminar.


43:28.905 --> 43:30.373

(sniffles)


43:30.407 --> 43:32.409

Siranna.


43:34.777 --> 43:37.748

That knife was hers.


43:38.748 --> 43:40.851

I left her


43:40.884 --> 43:44.221

without so much as a good-bye.


43:45.222 --> 43:48.425

You promise me--


43:48.458 --> 43:52.896

no matter how frightening
or painful it may be--


43:52.929 --> 43:55.733

promise me


43:55.766 --> 43:57.867

you will


43:57.900 --> 44:01.005

mend your relationship
with Spock.


44:01.038 --> 44:05.074

If you and I can build
this type of bond,


44:05.108 --> 44:07.244

Im certain
you can do the same with him.


44:08.344 --> 44:10.713

Please.


44:11.514 --> 44:13.717

I promise.


44:18.155 --> 44:22.059

Good-bye, Michael.


44:25.896 --> 44:28.731

I love you, Saru.


44:36.873 --> 44:39.443

Michael? What is wrong?


44:39.476 --> 44:43.280

I-I bare... I barely touched it.


44:43.313 --> 44:45.916

They fell out
on their own.


44:47.918 --> 44:50.219

(chuckles softly)


44:54.157 --> 44:56.059

I... I, uh...


44:56.092 --> 44:58.128

dont understand.


44:58.161 --> 45:00.297

I should be...


45:00.329 --> 45:03.067

(both laugh)


45:03.099 --> 45:06.402

POLLARD:


45:03.099 --> 45:06.402

<i>Your vital signs
have returned to normal.</i>


45:06.436 --> 45:07.804

How are you feeling?


45:07.838 --> 45:11.108

I have never felt
this way before.


45:11.141 --> 45:15.012

Fear has always been the
governing principle of my life.


45:15.045 --> 45:17.815

But now...


45:17.847 --> 45:20.184

it is gone.


45:20.217 --> 45:23.086

More than that,
I feel...


45:24.121 --> 45:25.889

...power.


45:25.922 --> 45:29.827

My own power.


45:29.860 --> 45:31.394

Well,


45:31.427 --> 45:34.965

consider yourself certified
for duty, Commander.


45:39.036 --> 45:43.440

Despite speaking 94 languages,


45:43.474 --> 45:47.945

there are times when
words are not enough.


45:55.085 --> 45:56.586

Initial reports


45:56.619 --> 45:58.822

are coming in
from the science teams.


46:00.623 --> 46:03.994

The sphere didnt just give us
its language.


46:04.027 --> 46:07.231

We have recorded everything
it has seen and experienced


46:07.264 --> 46:09.532

the last 100,000 years.


46:09.565 --> 46:11.934

Its legacy.


46:11.969 --> 46:14.871

And your legacy
has a new chapter.


46:16.273 --> 46:19.976

A new and deeply troubling one.


46:22.646 --> 46:24.181

The Kelpien way of life


46:24.213 --> 46:27.351

has always been oriented
toward death


46:27.384 --> 46:29.485

and the role the
Baul play in it.


46:29.519 --> 46:33.389

My people call it
"The Great Balance."


46:33.422 --> 46:37.360

It is our central,
organizing truth.


46:37.393 --> 46:38.961

But you proved it wrong.


46:38.996 --> 46:40.530

Precisely.


46:40.563 --> 46:44.201

And you asked me before
why I could not go home.


46:44.233 --> 46:48.539

It is because I made a promise
to Captain Georgiou


46:48.572 --> 46:51.875

to uphold General Order 1,


46:51.909 --> 46:55.612

not to interfere
with the destiny of my species.


46:55.646 --> 46:58.382

But now,


46:58.414 --> 47:02.985

knowing that what my people
have accepted as the truth


47:03.019 --> 47:06.023

is a lie?


47:08.291 --> 47:11.260

What does this mean for us?


47:11.295 --> 47:13.063

For my species?


47:13.096 --> 47:15.632

My... my planet?


47:21.704 --> 47:25.041

COMPUTER: The war between
the Quaternary star systems


47:25.074 --> 47:27.043

and the Roquarri Imperium
lasted a solar cent...


47:27.077 --> 47:28.445

(recording shuts off)


47:28.478 --> 47:30.447

From the sphere?


47:30.480 --> 47:32.648

(stammers)
The computers translation.


47:32.682 --> 47:35.117

Its like weve found
our galaxys Dead Sea Scrolls.


47:35.152 --> 47:38.021

Federation scientists will be
studying this for centuries


47:38.054 --> 47:40.523

thanks to you and Saru.


47:40.556 --> 47:43.226

I hope it was worth the cost.


47:44.260 --> 47:46.096

Cost us nothing, sir.


47:46.128 --> 47:48.297

I combed through the
spheres sensor records


47:48.331 --> 47:50.467

and found the last
thing that it saw:


47:50.500 --> 47:51.467

Spocks shuttle.


47:51.501 --> 47:54.304

I was able to track it
beyond our sensor range.


47:55.338 --> 47:56.940

Conn,


47:56.974 --> 47:58.574

Commander Burnham
is sending you


47:58.608 --> 48:00.210

the coordinates
of Spocks shuttle.


48:00.244 --> 48:01.612

Plot a course,
and dont spare the horses.


48:01.644 --> 48:02.646

DETMER:
Aye, sir.


48:05.581 --> 48:09.018

From now on,


48:09.052 --> 48:12.322

Ill work to keep you clear


48:12.356 --> 48:14.190

about whatever happens
with your brother.


48:14.224 --> 48:17.059

Thank you, Captain, but I have
had a change of heart.


48:18.594 --> 48:20.429

I cant abandon him.


48:20.463 --> 48:22.398

No matter the mistakes
that Ive made,


48:22.431 --> 48:25.469

I need my brother to know that
I will always be there for him.


48:25.501 --> 48:27.371

No matter what.


48:30.507 --> 48:32.643

(door whooshes open)


48:32.675 --> 48:34.677

We need to close the
door to the network.


48:34.710 --> 48:36.112

Forever.


48:36.146 --> 48:39.548

Just making
final calculations.


48:39.583 --> 48:42.719

MAY:<i>
Hi, hi. Hello? Hello? Its me.</i>


48:45.021 --> 48:46.188

Did you see that?


48:46.222 --> 48:47.690

See what?


48:46.222 --> 48:47.690

May.


48:47.724 --> 48:50.427

She was there,
and then she was gone.


48:50.460 --> 48:53.063

Um...
(laughs)


48:53.096 --> 48:56.565

...you might still be coming
down off your hallucinogen.


48:56.599 --> 48:57.733

No, I swear. I swear.


48:56.599 --> 48:57.733

RENO:
Yeah.


48:57.768 --> 49:00.036

No, its natural to be paranoid


49:00.070 --> 49:01.704

in your condition.


49:00.070 --> 49:01.704

Something is not right.


49:01.737 --> 49:02.706

Somethings not right.


49:02.739 --> 49:04.440

MAY:<i>
Hello?</i>


49:04.474 --> 49:05.608

<i>Tilly. Hello?</i>


49:05.641 --> 49:07.210

(echoing):<i>
Tilly. Hello, hello...</i>


49:08.644 --> 49:10.213

Wow.


49:10.246 --> 49:12.548

Have you always been
a superior being?


49:12.581 --> 49:14.483

MAY (echoing):<i>
Hi. Hello? Hello?</i>


49:14.518 --> 49:17.086

(echoing hoots)


49:14.518 --> 49:17.086

Because...


49:17.119 --> 49:18.755

the harmonics
in your aura...


49:18.789 --> 49:20.222

You know, I was thinking


49:20.257 --> 49:23.760

the exact same thing
about your aura.


49:23.793 --> 49:25.362

Whats that dust on your face?


49:25.394 --> 49:26.630

...dust on your face?


49:26.663 --> 49:28.231

Its on yours, too.


49:28.264 --> 49:29.099

STAMETS (echoes):<i>
...yours, too.</i>


49:29.132 --> 49:30.500

<i>That tastes like...</i>


49:30.534 --> 49:31.702

RENO:
Psilocybin?


49:31.735 --> 49:33.170

STAMETS:
Psilocybin?


49:33.202 --> 49:35.237

It dosed us. It dosed us.


49:35.271 --> 49:36.539

Slap me really hard.


49:38.541 --> 49:40.242

Whyd I do that?


49:40.277 --> 49:42.411

To get me focused enough
to find the med kit.


49:42.445 --> 49:44.780

I need to hit us both
with a shot of impedrizine


49:44.815 --> 49:46.148

so we can come down.


49:48.751 --> 49:51.454

Now I need to
give one to Tilly.


49:51.487 --> 49:53.090

Wait a minute. Where is she?


49:54.224 --> 49:55.324

Tilly?


49:56.360 --> 49:57.760

Wait.


49:59.161 --> 50:00.530

Oh, my God,
they took her.


50:00.563 --> 50:02.164

No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.


50:02.199 --> 50:03.300

(sucks air in)


50:04.501 --> 50:07.336

Tilly?


50:07.371 --> 50:09.139

No!
