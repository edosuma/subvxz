[cell door slams]

01:19.162 --> 01:20.581
[indistinct chatter]

01:24.918 --> 01:26.419
Dude. Focus.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.338
An ambush requires focus.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.465
[whispers] Dixon, Dixon.
Go for the small one.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.068
Butchy's got a neck like a telephone pole.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.593
I'm ready.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.054
Abort. Abort.

01:36.554 --> 01:38.835
- Abort, abort, abort.
- What? What the... What are you...

01:39.391 --> 01:41.852
Here you go, piggies.
Some slop for you.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.772
Gotta fatten you up for the slaughter.
Kidding.

01:45.648 --> 01:46.708
That crap will go right through ya.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.233
You'll all die thin.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.157
[softly] Cutlery.

02:00.328 --> 02:01.413
Bon appétit.

02:03.498 --> 02:04.833
What the fuck? I had her!

02:04.917 --> 02:07.419
- You fucking pussy.
- It wasn't the right time.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.128
There were too many of them.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.297
[exclaims]

02:10.380 --> 02:11.423
[McCullough] Oh, my God.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.227
- We're never getting out of here.
- [sighs]

02:13.884 --> 02:15.593
- Spork?
- [all sighing]

02:15.678 --> 02:17.554
[sighs and mutters]

02:17.638 --> 02:18.764
[indistinct chatter]

02:24.311 --> 02:28.315
Hey! I was gonna do that anyway,
so, thanks!

02:29.358 --> 02:31.610
[sighs]
[in Hawaiian] Filthy fucking cunts.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.071
[Zirconia laughing]

02:34.154 --> 02:36.448
[in English] Look-it.
Big boy and the Warden goin' at it.

02:36.531 --> 02:37.574
[inmates chuckle]

02:37.658 --> 02:39.702
That'll be a good name
for one of them buddy movies.

02:39.785 --> 02:40.785
<i>Big Boy and the Warden.</i>

02:40.827 --> 02:43.497
Ew. You think those two are...

02:43.580 --> 02:46.374
[smacks lips] I said buddy movie,
not butt-buddy movie.

02:46.458 --> 02:48.752
Although Chris Tucker was so far up

02:48.836 --> 02:50.670
- Jackie Chan's ass in <i>Rush Hour.</i>
- [chuckles]

02:50.754 --> 02:54.800
I seen the porn version of that one time
called <i>Gush Hour.</i> It was nasty.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.509
What was nasty?

02:56.593 --> 03:00.263
- This movie with a lot of wet...
- Daya, maybe it's, uh, time to rest?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.033
Yeah, I just gotta get my gun
back from Pidge.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.433
What? Oh.

03:05.102 --> 03:07.145
Still can't believe you let her have it
and not me.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.482
She's ready to hand it back. Would you?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.025
No, probably not.

03:12.109 --> 03:13.151
So...

03:14.737 --> 03:16.321
What's going on with those two?

03:16.404 --> 03:18.325
They're so different,
but they need to figure out

03:18.365 --> 03:19.675
how they're going to work together.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.284
[laughter]

03:21.368 --> 03:24.079
- [Angie] Cuckoo!
- Wonder Twin powers activate!

03:24.162 --> 03:25.205
[both laughing]

03:25.288 --> 03:26.874
[Gloria] Stop!
[Leanne] These are tight.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.375
- [gasps]
- Gun!

03:28.876 --> 03:30.668
- Oh, shit!
- [Leanne] Get it!

03:31.586 --> 03:32.670
[inmates clamoring]

03:40.428 --> 03:41.679
[screaming]

03:45.642 --> 03:47.019
[all gasping]

03:48.896 --> 03:51.774
Which one of you jalapeño hookers
grabbed my boob?

03:51.857 --> 03:52.858
Answer her!

03:53.817 --> 03:54.902
Oh, wait. Shit.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.780
That might've been me.
Sorry, that was crazy down there.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.366
Not my problem anymore, huh?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.119
[sighs]

04:04.202 --> 04:06.454
[panting] I knew it. Fuck!

04:06.538 --> 04:07.539
Shut up!

04:08.331 --> 04:09.958
Put your hands up!

04:11.543 --> 04:12.878
[inmate speaking Spanish]

04:13.336 --> 04:15.881
[in English] Hey! Hey, you guys
speaking <i>Española</i> over there.

04:15.964 --> 04:16.964
Yeah! Look at me.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.632
Look at me!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.095
I'm the <i>jefe</i> now. [chuckles]

04:23.513 --> 04:25.140
She's the <i>jefe.</i>

04:25.223 --> 04:26.623
[Alex] Okay, enough with these two.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.811
Ah. StreetEasy.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.478
Mmm-hmm.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.243
Let's search for New York
real estate porn.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.192
Gramercy Park.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.196
One bedroom, two baths...
hardwood floors, of course.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.531
Or two bedrooms...

04:41.614 --> 04:44.076
for, like, an office-guest room situation.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.888
Is it important to have a gym
in the building?

04:46.912 --> 04:49.832
How about cement floors, no windows
and a view of a toilet?

04:49.915 --> 04:52.811
Because that will be home if Von Barlow
tells her boyfriend what she heard.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.377
What's her real name again?

04:54.461 --> 04:58.715
Oh, my God. I don't...
I don't know. Linda... something.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.592
I guess. Linda.

05:00.675 --> 05:05.305
Linda, who has "Solsbury Hill" on every
single one of her Spotify playlists.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.389
[both laughing]

05:06.473 --> 05:08.725
Her heart is going boom-boom-boom.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.268
She could end you.

05:12.062 --> 05:14.022
I don't know how many ways to tell you...

05:15.357 --> 05:16.608
I don't give a good goddamn.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.361
Or a bad goddamn.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.198
I don't give any kind of goddamn,
goddamn.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.993
If she spills, she spills.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.162
I'm guilty. I did it.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.750
What will be will be.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.210
Jesus, Alex.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.545
I don't wanna talk about this
with you anymore.

05:41.508 --> 05:44.261
Lie with me under the stars and... and...

05:44.344 --> 05:46.346
look at homes that we'll never afford...

05:47.514 --> 05:49.432
thanks to sub-prime lending and...

05:49.516 --> 05:51.768
also because we're registered felons.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.397
You can feel guilty
and not destroy your life.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.107
- [sighs]
- Which is long.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.566
And involves me.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.988
You have to care
about protecting yourself.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.555
Do you think you were born this way?

06:08.160 --> 06:11.121
Or do I have Carol to thank for your
exhausting need to control everything?

06:11.204 --> 06:13.623
Fine, I don't need a gym.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.420
Hardwood floor's a deal breaker.
And playing the Carol card was very low.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.672
Hey, sometimes you gotta haul out
the big guns.

06:20.755 --> 06:21.756
[exhales]

06:21.839 --> 06:23.508
Hey, baby.
[sighs]

06:23.591 --> 06:25.552
Uh, hopefully you can hear me.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.804
Please tell Daddy and Sahar
that I'm okay...

06:27.887 --> 06:28.931
[door rattling]

06:29.014 --> 06:30.974
[Judy] Oh, Jonesy! Thank God!

06:31.058 --> 06:32.392
Don't "Jonesy" me!

06:32.475 --> 06:35.353
We know about your special panic room.
Where is it?

06:35.437 --> 06:38.065
- My what?
- Your VIP bunker.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.399
You got snacks in there?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.026
She's got a secret snack bunker?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.360
No, of course I don't.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.484
If I had a panic room,
don't you think I'd be in it?

06:44.529 --> 06:45.530
Baloney!

06:45.613 --> 06:49.701
We saw a text from your boy toy, Reg,
saying you were being taken care of.

06:49.784 --> 06:50.928
What? Well, go on, let me see that.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.995
Ah. Ah. Ah.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.707
Reg is the husband, Bill is the boy toy.

06:55.790 --> 06:56.959
Huh!

06:57.042 --> 06:58.293
Don't wanna share, huh?

06:58.376 --> 06:59.544
Scrooge McDuck.

06:59.627 --> 07:00.628
Hey, turban!

07:01.713 --> 07:04.799
- How do you waterboard someone?
- Join the military.

07:04.882 --> 07:07.594
[chuckles] And they say
Muslims ain't funny.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.928
You're a fuckin' riot.

07:09.012 --> 07:12.224
You know, I have worked
with many Muslims, many African Americans,

07:12.307 --> 07:14.601
I've had nothing but good experiences.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.062
Yeah, nice try and all,
but I can't help you here.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.106
I got my own fish to fry.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.774
You get service here?

07:21.858 --> 07:22.859
[indistinct chatter]

07:22.943 --> 07:24.569
Maybe I'll get the fried fish.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.154
Mmm.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.323
It's beer battered. Not halal.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.368
Look at you,
kickin' the "Allah knows best."

07:31.451 --> 07:32.619
Shoot. It looked good.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.681
Fried's not good for you anyway.
Get the grilled.

07:35.705 --> 07:36.957
Fine, but I'm getting fries.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.251
Your body, your choice.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.003
Your body, too.

07:42.754 --> 07:43.794
You really wanna share it?

07:44.922 --> 07:46.341
I'm willing to.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.552
Is it a dream come true?

07:49.636 --> 07:52.180
No, but... [inhales deeply]

07:52.264 --> 07:54.432
I'm working more than ever.
[sighs]

07:54.516 --> 07:57.019
- The Noodle is not getting...
- The Noodle is fine.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.980
She's perfect.
She's my perfect, pretty princess.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.149
Okay, you've got to cut that out.

08:02.232 --> 08:05.110
She's not a perfect, pretty princess.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.570
She's a smart young woman.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.115
She's strong.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.117
She's beautiful.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.036
We gotta use empowering words.

08:14.119 --> 08:16.871
Not cute and princess.

08:17.455 --> 08:21.001
She's strong and beautiful,

08:21.084 --> 08:23.836
and smart, just like her mother.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.673
My pretty princess wife. <i>Masha-Allah.</i>

08:26.756 --> 08:29.467
Can we get back to the discussion, please?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.445
Babe, if you're so overwhelmed
with work and Farah,

08:31.469 --> 08:32.708
why don't we just hire a nanny?

08:32.761 --> 08:34.931
Because there's also you.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.558
You need more, too.

08:38.601 --> 08:39.686
I'm fine.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.731
Hassan, I want a peaceful home.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.694
And right now, I finish my work...

08:47.777 --> 08:49.487
- [sighs]
- you get back from your work,

08:49.571 --> 08:52.865
we're both tired and cranky, and...

08:52.949 --> 08:56.619
Farah's got homework, we gotta eat...

08:57.620 --> 08:58.955
the house is a mess. It's just...

08:59.039 --> 09:03.000
It's all too much, and we're not getting
the best parts of each other.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.422
I don't know why this seems like
such a big deal for you.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.257
Most of our friends have done it.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.008
Your dad has three wives.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.470
It wasn't always peace in the valley
at our house.

09:13.553 --> 09:17.307
Plus, he's 63 years old, and manscapes.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.870
Not really one to model a life after.

09:19.601 --> 09:20.685
How about this?

09:21.603 --> 09:23.438
Let's be open to it?

09:23.521 --> 09:27.442
If the right person comes along,
then we'll talk more.

09:29.611 --> 09:33.782
And frankly,
a little trimming wouldn't kill you.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.036
[indistinct chatter]

09:41.664 --> 09:43.125
Ugh. This is killing me!

09:43.208 --> 09:46.669
Look at that snaggley smile.
That's my guy.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.630
- Teeth. Wow.
- [chuckles]

09:48.713 --> 09:51.048
All the Hardings got it.
Snaggle's loud and proud.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.925
[both laugh]

09:53.009 --> 09:54.219
[Judy] This is insane.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.429
You really need to attach me to a plank?

09:56.513 --> 09:58.348
You're a flight risk.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.409
- [sighs]
- If you try to run, this'll slow you down.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.643
It's funny.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.104
Maybe we can build a rack out of these.

10:04.187 --> 10:06.189
Stretch her out
till she delivers the treats?

10:06.273 --> 10:07.857
Can you google "torture rack"?

10:07.940 --> 10:09.651
- There are no treats!
- More rope.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.735
[Brandy] Awesome.

10:10.818 --> 10:13.196
Fuck the treats.
This'll be more fun.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.258
We just need something to pull
the nails out of these,

10:15.282 --> 10:16.717
and then something to bang them into her!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.493
- [Anita chuckles]
- Yeah, okay, all right.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.453
Okay, fine! You win.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.290
All right, the truth is...

10:23.373 --> 10:24.975
there's a supply drop
that's coming for me.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.419
- It's not in yet, but it's coming.
- [Anita laughs]

10:27.502 --> 10:28.503
I knew it!

10:28.586 --> 10:29.712
When? When's the drop?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.131
Uh, tonight.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.633
Soon. Uh, on the roof.

10:33.716 --> 10:37.554
Helicopter's bringing pizzas, booze,
cigarettes, you name it.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.721
Excellent! Let's go!

10:38.805 --> 10:40.473
Sankey, you coming?

10:42.725 --> 10:43.726
Hey, what's up?

10:44.561 --> 10:45.562
[sniffling]

10:46.479 --> 10:47.772
- Aw, that sucks.
- [snickers]

10:47.855 --> 10:49.191
Those teeth.

10:52.819 --> 10:53.820
[breath trembling] Fuck.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.659
[trays clattering loudly]

11:01.911 --> 11:03.538
[grunting]

11:08.084 --> 11:09.794
What was that?

11:09.877 --> 11:11.213
Did you hear that?

11:12.630 --> 11:14.131
The trays crashing?

11:15.633 --> 11:16.718
What trays crashing?

11:17.510 --> 11:19.053
- [roof creaking]
- [Suzanne exclaims]

11:20.430 --> 11:24.183
No, that is either a mischief of rats...

11:24.267 --> 11:26.811
- A mischief?
- That's what a group of rats is called.

11:26.894 --> 11:29.939
Um, a group of ferrets
is called a business.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.442
No, I didn't hear ferrets.

11:32.525 --> 11:37.196
I heard either a mischief of mutant rats
with human pinkie toes...

11:37.280 --> 11:42.118
air vibrating through wind turbines, or C.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.204
C... I'm thinking C.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.039
What's C?

11:47.123 --> 11:49.834
I don't know... but it's gonna be good.

11:51.253 --> 11:52.337
Her spirit.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.966
Poussey's spirit.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.138
I thought you said
that ghosts aren't real?

12:02.221 --> 12:03.931
They aren't.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.016
Spirits are.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.394
What's the difference?

12:07.477 --> 12:10.480
Spirits come from the other side
to visit those they love

12:10.563 --> 12:12.274
that are still left here on Earth.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.567
No such thing as ghosts.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.862
Uh, I'm still not...
I'm not getting the difference.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.864
Go with it.
[clears throat]

12:19.947 --> 12:21.157
[shivers]

12:21.240 --> 12:23.117
[stutters] That.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.243
What was that?

12:25.036 --> 12:26.329
I don't know. I shivered.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.997
Because you were cold?

12:28.998 --> 12:30.198
Or because you felt something?

12:30.875 --> 12:33.503
You know, I heard that ghosts...

12:33.586 --> 12:35.713
- No... There are no ghosts!
- [Brook sighs]

12:35.797 --> 12:38.675
Uh, spirits...

12:38.758 --> 12:40.427
sometimes...

12:40.510 --> 12:44.431
can't leave the spot where they died...

12:45.348 --> 12:50.227
until they... resolve
some unfinished business.

12:54.065 --> 12:56.233
[man on video]
<i>Five to ten seconds at most.</i>

12:56.318 --> 12:59.028
<i>Be sure not to blow on the solder,
otherwise...</i>

12:59.111 --> 13:03.032
<i>Don't do that. This can make it lumpy,
or can also add impurities.</i>

13:03.115 --> 13:05.452
<i>Now, you want to repeat this
until you're finished.</i>

13:05.535 --> 13:09.706
<i>So, you're gonna repeat these above steps
for each point that you want to solder.</i>

13:09.789 --> 13:13.543
<i>So, re-tin your iron's tip, okay,
every several applications.</i>

13:15.878 --> 13:18.047
[breathing heavily] <i>Wepa!</i>

13:18.130 --> 13:19.841
Blake was on tour six years.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.593
Afghanistan?

13:21.676 --> 13:23.177
[chuckling] Oh, shit.

13:23.260 --> 13:24.346
Morman Miracle Pageant.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.638
[scoffs]

13:25.722 --> 13:27.765
- He was in some kind of musical.
- [sighs]

13:27.849 --> 13:30.184
Once you start scratching
the surface on somebody,

13:30.267 --> 13:31.936
it's crazy the kind of shit you find.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.646
That's why I try to keep my nails short.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.440
Don't wanna scratch too deep
and hit crazy.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.108
[sighs]

13:37.191 --> 13:41.320
Maybe instead of "P" for Piscatella,
he filed it under "S" for son of a bitch.

13:41.404 --> 13:43.155
[grunting]

13:43.239 --> 13:45.658
[pants] Feeling kind of sweaty.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.784
You feeling sweaty?

13:46.868 --> 13:48.745
No. That's over, thank God.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.456
Although for years,
I was one giant hot flash.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.042
- Some things do get better with age.
- Like what?

13:55.126 --> 13:58.295
My leg hair grows in patchier.
Not so much shaving to do.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.423
My skin feels softer.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.801
I don't give as many fucks,
although that's not really true.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.720
I give many fucks.

14:05.803 --> 14:08.014
The problem is, I don't feel old.

14:08.097 --> 14:11.058
I feel 27, and then I get a look at myself

14:11.142 --> 14:14.061
and I can't believe
the lines and the sags.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.189
I was a beautiful girl.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.402
But worried. And stupid.
[inhales sharply]

14:20.485 --> 14:21.879
- [drawer closes]
- I'm tougher now.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.696
And if I get the fuck out of here...

14:25.239 --> 14:27.950
I'd get senior discounts, I guess.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.202
I do like a discount.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.930
I'd also like to learn
how to do that thing

14:31.954 --> 14:34.666
where you stand up in the water and row.

14:34.749 --> 14:35.958
Huh, what is that?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.544
- Paddleboarding?
- Yes!

14:37.627 --> 14:39.462
[gasps] I think I'd like to do that.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.338
[exclaiming]

14:43.716 --> 14:44.717
[Blanca] Whoa.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.886
In a wetsuit. On a lake.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.179
You got good balance there.

14:48.262 --> 14:51.098
I do. I do. I do.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.769
Hey, what's in those boxes, huh?

14:54.852 --> 14:56.521
- [panting]
- On the bookshelf there!

15:02.527 --> 15:03.695
Ha!

15:04.654 --> 15:05.697
Piscatella!

15:05.780 --> 15:06.781
Boom!

15:10.076 --> 15:11.356
[in Spanish] Motherfucker, dude.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.971
[in English] This is
longer than <i>Infinite Jest.</i>

15:12.995 --> 15:14.622
Hey, you got any more of those vitamins?

15:14.706 --> 15:16.332
I was thinking the same thing.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.584
[pills rattling]

15:28.803 --> 15:30.179
We could escape!

15:30.763 --> 15:33.725
We could take the hostages ourselves
and bust out of here!

15:33.808 --> 15:35.059
- [yelps]
- [all gasping]

15:35.142 --> 15:36.644
- [yelps]
- Don't, Ang!

15:37.979 --> 15:39.271
- Christ!
- Oh, sorry.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.565
[both panting]

15:40.648 --> 15:43.485
I did that a few months ago,
and there was nowhere to go.

15:43.568 --> 15:46.278
- It was a real bummer.
- God damn it!

15:46.362 --> 15:51.576
I wish we could just sit around
and get high and watch <i>The Voice.</i>

15:52.660 --> 15:54.245
[stutters]

15:54.328 --> 15:57.206
I mean, we should be able
to do that, right?

15:57.289 --> 15:58.332
'Cause we have the gun.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.959
- Yeah.
- We should be able to make...

16:00.042 --> 16:02.419
all our dreams come true.

16:02.504 --> 16:04.506
Can't I just, like,
shoot the power back on?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.382
[in Spanish] Meth-head with a gun.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.652
- This is what my mom warned me about.
- What'd she say?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.012
Never go near a meth-head with a gun.

16:11.095 --> 16:14.599
Then why the fuck are we standing here?

16:14.682 --> 16:15.743
[in English] It's a cliffhanger.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.228
Attention! Hey, hey, everybody!

16:19.311 --> 16:22.273
- Attention!
- Listen! Everyone!

16:22.356 --> 16:24.066
Now...

16:24.150 --> 16:27.820
We have finally figured out
what to do with our newfound power.

16:31.032 --> 16:34.577
We're gonna host a talent show!

16:37.079 --> 16:39.624
Performed by...

16:43.961 --> 16:44.962
them.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.924
[inmates clamoring]

16:50.092 --> 16:52.219
- [both] Cheer!
- [inmates cheering]

16:52.303 --> 16:53.638
Cheer!

16:53.721 --> 16:54.806
[cheering and laughing]

17:01.145 --> 17:02.855
Hey, guess what?

17:05.775 --> 17:07.819
I love the space program.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.820
Don't you wanna know what's out there?

17:09.904 --> 17:12.489
I'm dealing with a lot of shit
on planet Earth right now.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.617
Not really giving space a lot of thought.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.203
You sound just like Sister Ingalls.
[scoffs]

17:17.286 --> 17:18.996
She hates the space program.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.624
Thinks it's a waste of resources.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.375
Well, I have two words for her.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.336
Extra terrestrials.

17:26.337 --> 17:29.591
Maybe there's life out there

17:29.674 --> 17:32.677
and they have the answers to our problems.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.931
Magical aliens are gonna solve
all the problems we created?

17:37.014 --> 17:39.726
It's important to keep exploring.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.495
I think we should take action
in the here and now

17:42.519 --> 17:44.480
and stop looking to the stars for answers.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.108
Sister knows what's important.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.612
I'm not her, but if you think
I sound like her, I'm flattered.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.739
You wanna be like Sister?

17:55.366 --> 17:56.533
I'd be lucky.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.495
She's the best person I know.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.123
You sure this is the right way?

18:02.206 --> 18:05.292
Oh, there's a staircase
around here somewhere.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.379
Should take us right to the drop spot.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.590
I call dibs on all the edibles.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.341
Posting this shit on the Internet?

18:12.424 --> 18:14.927
It's like he's throwing it
right in my face.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.804
- God, she even looks like you.
- [scoffs]

18:16.888 --> 18:19.288
You shoulda seen her hair
before I showed her how to wear it.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.433
Wait, you know her?

18:21.517 --> 18:23.645
That's Corinne.
We had an arrangement.

18:26.397 --> 18:29.776
I was going away for a while,
so we made a deal.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.194
Now, if Anders was gonna
stick his flagpole somewhere,

18:32.278 --> 18:34.196
I wanted it in familiar ground.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.365
It was supposed to stay in the bedroom.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.660
Where's the staircase to heaven?

18:39.410 --> 18:40.577
[yelps and grunts]

18:41.663 --> 18:43.039
[panting]

18:43.122 --> 18:44.331
Oh, my God!

18:45.708 --> 18:47.877
Oh, my God. I'm bleeding!
[whimpering]

18:50.838 --> 18:51.923
Relax!

18:54.466 --> 18:56.010
- Ketchup.
- [scoffs]

18:56.093 --> 18:58.262
[Anita] Looks like some folks
had a condiment war.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.097
I think mustard won the day.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.348
Uh, I'm feeling faint.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.851
Can we rest for a moment?
Just for a minute?

19:03.935 --> 19:05.561
- [panting]
- No rest for the wicked.

19:06.646 --> 19:07.980
[moans]

19:09.899 --> 19:11.776
She went to Brittany's birthday party?

19:12.484 --> 19:13.778
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:13.861 --> 19:15.780
And a fucking princess cake?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.257
The bitch bought her a princess cake!

19:17.281 --> 19:19.826
Technically, that's a mermaid,
not a princess.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.036
Until the end of the stupid movie.

19:22.119 --> 19:25.039
Then she's a princess
who gave up her voice to chase a man.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.417
He knows how I feel about
the fucking mermaid!

19:29.376 --> 19:31.212
And when our girl rises up from the sea,

19:31.295 --> 19:35.591
it'll be on her God-given talents,
not some magical sea witch's spell.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.795
And she'll know better
than to marry outside her race.

19:39.804 --> 19:42.348
[man] Hey! All right, come on.
Let's go.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.148
Uh, Sahar?

19:51.232 --> 19:54.151
You think it would ruin your creation
if I took off the princess?

19:55.152 --> 19:56.552
You're not feeling knock-off Tiana?

19:56.988 --> 20:00.282
Not a fan of the whole princess thing
in general.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.909
I think it sends the wrong message.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.035
Fair enough.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.663
Can we do the cake now? Please?

20:06.748 --> 20:09.291
Almost. Let's finish up the game first.

20:10.835 --> 20:13.670
Oh. Remind me I gotta pick up
a graduation gift

20:13.755 --> 20:16.590
for Hassan's sister's
best friend's kid tomorrow.

20:16.673 --> 20:17.800
Whose name is...

20:17.884 --> 20:19.010
- Karima.
- Mmm...

20:19.093 --> 20:20.803
[both] With the eyebrows extreme-a.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.304
[both laugh]

20:25.016 --> 20:26.183
Shabammy!

20:26.267 --> 20:28.519
- [laughing]
- Shabammy? Seriously?

20:28.602 --> 20:29.997
[chuckles] That's my good luck word.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.832
- Ah...
- [chuckles] I think you could do better.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.733
Y'all just hating.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.527
Don't you wanna be told
when you're acting a fool?

20:36.610 --> 20:38.612
- I know I would.
- Oh, me, too.

20:38.695 --> 20:39.696
Me three.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.424
Hey!
You're supposed to be on my team, right?

20:41.448 --> 20:43.117
- Right.
- Good.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.161
Now, go show 'em how it's done,
birthday girl.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.712
I suck!

20:55.797 --> 20:57.464
Oh, baby, you don't suck.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.389
Can I show you
how to keep your wrist straight?

21:03.179 --> 21:05.556
It's working, right?

21:05.639 --> 21:07.516
- It's good.
- [Hassan] Better be.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.518
We're in it till death do us part.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.729
Or until the team of wife and wife
beats me in bowling,

21:12.814 --> 21:15.149
and we both know
that ain't gonna never happen.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.318
- <i>Insha-Allah.</i>
- [both chuckle]

21:22.073 --> 21:23.115
[squeals]

21:24.325 --> 21:25.659
- Shabammy!
- [all cheering]

21:28.412 --> 21:31.748
[Maureen] Leaves fall.
Flowers away.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.627
Lengthen night and shorten day.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.507
Keep us warm and close to thee...

21:41.425 --> 21:44.220
till light again can comfort me.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.014
What the fuck y'all doing?

21:47.098 --> 21:50.434
Sisters... welcome.

21:50.517 --> 21:53.312
Please... join us.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.730
We're about to begin the séance.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.065
[scoffs]

21:56.148 --> 21:57.149
I'm sorry, the what?

21:57.233 --> 22:00.236
We are summoning Poussey's spirit.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.739
You know, making sure
there's no unfinished business.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.543
Well, of course
there's unfinished business.

22:05.616 --> 22:06.951
She didn't get to live her life.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.286
We... we just wanna offer her some peace.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.539
Well, y'all have fun
with y'all pretend time.

22:13.665 --> 22:15.209
Here, Suzanne.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.838
I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.

22:18.921 --> 22:20.047
It's reversible.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.423
Thought you'd like it.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.927
Oh, I do!

22:25.011 --> 22:26.595
- [Taystee chuckles]
- Thank you.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.891
That looks nice on you.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.895
Yo, Brook.
You humoring them with this shit?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.647
I never got to say goodbye.

22:38.190 --> 22:41.068
- Maybe this is my chance.
- [Suzanne] No. Wait a minute.

22:41.944 --> 22:43.654
The spirits are getting stronger.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.116
There's an object that's calling to 'em.

22:48.617 --> 22:49.618
[grunts softly]

22:51.870 --> 22:52.870
There.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.850
- Those were hers.
- [Taystee] Man, what the fuck?

22:55.874 --> 22:57.793
- How you know that?
- Just do.

22:57.876 --> 22:58.876
We need them.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.130
Look, Elephant Man.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.758
You come close to my sneaks,
your face gonna be double swollen.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.177
Calm down.

23:06.260 --> 23:10.556
We're just trying to make
a spirit-friendly atmosphere.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.474
Man, come on!
This is some bullshit. Ooh.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.560
[stammering]

23:14.643 --> 23:16.603
Actually, I'm kinda loving this.

23:16.687 --> 23:20.399
I mean, you wanna walk away
from some free entertainment?

23:20.482 --> 23:21.483
Scoot over.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.362
I ain't taking off my shoes.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.198
Oh, we just need them in the circle.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.116
[sighs]

23:30.701 --> 23:33.120
[Black Cindy] Come on, Taystee.

23:33.204 --> 23:34.538
[Black Cindy chuckles]

23:37.458 --> 23:39.293
Everyone, please...

23:40.252 --> 23:41.545
join hands.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.381
[both chuckle]

23:47.259 --> 23:49.470
Everyone, please...

23:50.596 --> 23:52.556
join hands!

23:52.639 --> 23:53.932
[inhales deeply]

23:54.016 --> 23:59.646
[chanting] Mighty spirit...

23:59.730 --> 24:04.651
we are ready to receive you.

24:11.658 --> 24:12.994
She's here.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.704
I can smell her...

24:16.955 --> 24:18.874
[whispers] with my ears.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.459
Oh, shit.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.358
- [Angie] Come on! Hey!
- [inmates clamoring]

24:26.382 --> 24:28.884
Titties, put those beasts to work.
Move your ass.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.803
- Hey, no loafing, motherfuckers. Let's go.
- [inmate] Loafing?

24:31.887 --> 24:34.640
Beds out! Bitches, go!
Motherfuckers!

24:34.723 --> 24:37.268
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.966
- Do you wanna be one of the judges?
- [Big Boo] Finally.

24:40.021 --> 24:43.607
Someone appreciates me for my biting wit
and of course, impeccable taste.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.484
Not you, Ca-Boo-to.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.903
- Funny.
- We want her.

24:48.445 --> 24:51.740
Oh, me?
I don't... I don't know.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.075
Oh, see, the thing is,

24:53.159 --> 24:56.203
we need one of those, like,
just-edging-outta-cool,

24:56.287 --> 24:58.705
needs-to-pay-the-mortgage types
who can say useful things,

24:58.789 --> 25:00.541
but with a tinge of sadness.

25:00.624 --> 25:02.459
I'm the tell-it-like-it-is judge.

25:02.543 --> 25:05.022
But I thought I was tell-it-like-it-is
and you were gonna be, like,

25:05.046 --> 25:06.463
comforting and supportive.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.675
Are you fucking serious right now?

25:11.968 --> 25:13.345
Yeah, I guess that's a stretch.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.389
I can be supportive when I have to be.

25:15.472 --> 25:19.476
Yeah, the thing is, we were thinking
that you could be the stage manager.

25:19.560 --> 25:23.105
Of course.
The dyke does tech. Perfect.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.358
- Ooh! Ooh! Mexico!
- Excuse me?

25:26.442 --> 25:29.861
- We are making something really special...
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.548
And we're gonna let you be part of it.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.365
See, there's always a Hispanic.

25:33.449 --> 25:37.161
You can be the Hispanic.
Yi, yi, yi, yi, yi!

25:37.244 --> 25:39.413
- [both laugh]
- What the fuck are you talking about?

25:39.496 --> 25:41.582
Judge. Like with Shakira.

25:41.665 --> 25:42.958
[Leanne] Or JLo.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.227
- But that's a different show.
- No.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.502
I hate that stuck-up bitch.

25:45.586 --> 25:47.147
- She's a fucking bitch.
- Fucking cunt.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.356
[Angie] I heard she kicked a dog.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.174
- I'm sure she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.925
Well, come on.
It's gonna be fun.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.303
- [grunts]
- [Angie] See, the thing is,

25:54.386 --> 25:56.722
I think you got a great eye for talent.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.390
I just feel that about you.

25:58.474 --> 26:01.477
Plus, we're gonna get to make the guards
feel real bad about themselves.

26:02.811 --> 26:05.522
And, uh, she's got the gun...

26:05.606 --> 26:07.358
and she wants you to do it...

26:08.609 --> 26:11.320
[whispers] so you kinda
don't have a choice.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.367
Are we supposed to perform
like dancing monkeys?

26:16.450 --> 26:19.453
[Dixon] <i>♪ Momma made me mash my M&M's</i>
<i>Bum, bum ♪</i>

26:19.536 --> 26:22.456
<i>♪ Momma made me mash my M&M's

26:22.539 --> 26:24.833
<i>♪ Momma made me mash my M&M's
Bum... ♪</i>

26:24.916 --> 26:28.129
You know, we all don't have to sing?

26:28.212 --> 26:29.546
There are other talents.

26:29.630 --> 26:31.632
Singing is my talent, <i>hombre.</i>

26:31.715 --> 26:33.360
If you feel threatened,
you could do something else.

26:33.384 --> 26:34.843
What are you singing?

26:34.926 --> 26:35.969
I don't know.

26:36.052 --> 26:39.223
Something pop-y.
JT or Usher.

26:41.057 --> 26:43.620
Or "Surrey with the Fringe on Top"
from <i>Oklahoma!</i> I haven't decided yet.

26:43.644 --> 26:46.355
Yeah, well, I got zero talents.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.315
Yeah, well, you gotta think of something.

26:48.399 --> 26:51.568
It's gun to the head. Literally.
Can you juggle?

26:51.652 --> 26:53.028
- No.
- [Blake] Play a sport?

26:53.111 --> 26:54.112
I threw javelin.

26:54.196 --> 26:56.657
I never knew anyone who did that.
That's cool.

26:56.740 --> 26:57.925
You need special shoes for that?

26:57.949 --> 26:59.201
They got spikes.

27:02.371 --> 27:04.415
[stammers] I did
this one thing in college,

27:04.498 --> 27:05.600
just for, like, a couple extra bucks.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.000
Sounds promising.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.461
Why are we even doing this?

27:10.546 --> 27:12.173
It's not like they can kill us all.

27:12.256 --> 27:14.508
You see what happened
to your guard friend?

27:14.591 --> 27:16.051
What's his name, Humps?

27:16.927 --> 27:19.430
He wasn't dead,
but he wasn't exactly alive either.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.850
Five minutes to places, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.352
Five minutes.

27:25.436 --> 27:26.437
Thank you five.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.064
It's a thing.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.066
[Davis inhales deeply]

27:31.149 --> 27:34.861
<i>♪ Momma made me mash my M&M's
Bum, bum ♪</i>

27:47.416 --> 27:48.792
Burset?

27:48.875 --> 27:50.168
Where are you going?

27:50.252 --> 27:52.588
I'm leaving... through the front door.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.839
I need to see my friend.

27:54.756 --> 27:58.385
Sophia, the fate of a large black person
coming out of the dark

27:58.469 --> 28:01.012
through the front door
isn't a promising one right now.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.767
I'm willing to take my chances.
It's up to God, right?

28:06.184 --> 28:08.103
Uh, no, it's up to you.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.022
That's right.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.024
It's up to me.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.627
You want this spot?

28:32.878 --> 28:34.170
I made a pillow.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.382
I'm good.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.175
So quiet out here.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.886
[inmate] Yeah.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.679
There was so much yelling in there.

28:43.930 --> 28:46.308
Bitches were screaming so loud,
my brain got numb.

28:46.392 --> 28:49.395
[Dwight] Yeah, noisy bitches.
I hate that.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.730
And really smelly bitches.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.694
- [music playing on radio]
- And bitchy bitches.

28:53.774 --> 28:56.527
You think we're gonna
get in trouble being out here

28:56.610 --> 28:58.194
since technically it's count time?

28:58.279 --> 29:00.322
Maybe we get counted as sitting it out.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.241
That would be cool. [chuckles]

29:04.285 --> 29:05.702
Plus, the music's good.

29:07.871 --> 29:11.041
- Maybe we could just listen to it.
- [turns up volume]

29:26.307 --> 29:27.849
[music continues]

29:30.269 --> 29:31.437
[chuckles softly]

29:38.319 --> 29:40.446
[sighing]

29:40.529 --> 29:42.948
[whispers] Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.035
Hello?

29:49.371 --> 29:51.206
[sighs] This is the third message.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.919
There's five of you,
why is no one ever near the phone?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.466
Jesus Christ, okay.

30:03.093 --> 30:04.177
Um...

30:06.262 --> 30:07.764
The battery's gonna die.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.352
So, um...

30:12.478 --> 30:14.646
[scoffs] call your mother.

30:21.403 --> 30:22.696
[sighs]

30:34.249 --> 30:36.084
- He's sleeping.
- You missed a button.

30:36.877 --> 30:38.253
[chuckles]

30:38.337 --> 30:41.965
He took an Ambien.
If you wake him, he's gonna get weird.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.511
There's a standoff at Litchfield Prison.
They've taken hostages.

30:45.594 --> 30:46.637
The governor should know.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.264
I can't be held responsible
for any binge eating,

30:49.348 --> 30:51.182
or inappropriate e-mailing
after you wake him.

30:51.892 --> 30:54.395
You remember the two loaves of bread
and the Nutella?

30:54.478 --> 30:57.022
Three jars, Nita.
Ambien eating.

30:57.105 --> 30:58.231
We'll clean it up.

30:58.314 --> 31:00.555
And I'll take away his phone
and his laptop till morning.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.075
[Hutchinson grunts]

31:09.159 --> 31:11.453
- When did this come in?
- Five minutes ago.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.997
[sighs] MCC.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.290
That's Paulson?

31:15.374 --> 31:16.542
Pearson. Jack Pearson.

31:16.625 --> 31:18.293
Right, that's right.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.920
That guy's a real fart-sniffer.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.464
Who negotiated for the inmates?

31:23.674 --> 31:26.552
No one, I don't think.
It... it came straight from them.

31:26.635 --> 31:27.719
Shit!

31:27.803 --> 31:29.555
They make some fair points.

31:30.597 --> 31:34.017
Grab my...
laptop from over there, will you?

31:34.100 --> 31:36.770
Or, uh, you could dictate.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.354
- Why don't you dictate?
- [sighs]

31:39.147 --> 31:41.024
I can't do this right now.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.788
We'll call them
first thing in the morning.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.861
- The inmates?
- MCC.

31:45.696 --> 31:48.323
That's six hours from now.
That's a long time, sir.

31:49.658 --> 31:50.784
There are hostages.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.287
It's a women's minimum security prison.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.332
Probably one big
Take Back the Night rally.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.586
Maybe less armpit hair.

32:00.669 --> 32:01.829
Do they have razors in there?

32:02.838 --> 32:04.423
Come back in the morning.

32:04.506 --> 32:08.093
On your way out, could you tell Ashley
that we need to discuss the...

32:08.176 --> 32:10.804
She... she should just come back
in here... Situation.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.973
I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

32:18.353 --> 32:21.815
Jeez! I never thought
I'd find someone slower than me.

32:21.898 --> 32:25.694
You know, I am walking in the dark
with Heinz 57 in my eyes,

32:25.777 --> 32:28.029
attached to a goddamn wooden plank!

32:28.113 --> 32:29.906
Oh, poor you.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.825
I have Morton's neuroma.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.845
Yeah, well, I probably have
Wolfgang Puck's herpes,

32:33.869 --> 32:35.309
but I don't go around announcing it.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.414
Did you think you were being
the cool girl or something?

32:38.499 --> 32:41.502
Don't you know the cool girl
always ends up alone or fat?

32:41.585 --> 32:43.795
Or both in my cousin April's case.

32:43.879 --> 32:48.133
I thought it'd be like one of those
open-minded relationships, you know?

32:48.216 --> 32:50.218
I think you mean open relationship.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.178
They can be quite wonderful...

32:52.262 --> 32:54.264
Don't correct her!
Who asked you anyway?

32:54.347 --> 32:57.017
I only brought it up
because I happen to be in one myself.

32:57.100 --> 32:59.853
Of course you are, money bags.
This is different.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.498
When's the last time
you had to suck a dick?

33:01.522 --> 33:04.107
Well, I don't see it as a "have to" thing.

33:04.190 --> 33:08.153
Oh, I just can't believe he got so public
about it, ya know?

33:08.236 --> 33:09.988
- It's a real small town.
- [sighs]

33:10.071 --> 33:12.658
My doctor's also my dentist
and sometimes cuts my hair.

33:13.784 --> 33:14.993
Now everyone knows.

33:15.076 --> 33:18.539
- Your kid. She knows.
- Jesus. Helen, be sensitive.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.626
Shit! There's no reception here.
I need service! I gotta call him.

33:22.709 --> 33:24.419
Where the fuck are we?

33:24.503 --> 33:27.297
Well, I got myself turned around.
You know, this is a prison.

33:27.380 --> 33:29.901
You know, they don't want people going up
on the roof all the time.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.385
They like to keep that access aloof.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.554
[Anita sighs]

33:35.096 --> 33:36.640
You guys go ahead.
I gotta find bars.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.518
Tragic.

33:49.235 --> 33:50.236
[sighs]

33:52.781 --> 33:54.741
Hey, Noodle!

33:54.825 --> 33:56.952
Ah! Perfect timing.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.412
I've got lunch ready for you.

33:59.495 --> 34:00.581
[Farah] Mommy, look.

34:00.664 --> 34:02.165
Aren't they cool?

34:08.672 --> 34:09.715
You let her do that?

34:09.797 --> 34:11.632
You said whatever she wanted.

34:12.634 --> 34:16.304
I meant a bracelet, maybe a purse.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.764
Not body mutilation.

34:17.848 --> 34:21.184
Oh, that's a little harsh,
don't you think?

34:22.018 --> 34:24.187
Sahar, can you please take Farah
into the den?

34:30.235 --> 34:31.527
You need to relax.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.072
- Me?
- She's her daughter, too.

34:35.156 --> 34:36.699
Oh, really?

34:36.783 --> 34:40.453
I don't remember her in the delivery room
pushing that melon head out.

34:40.536 --> 34:45.125
You can't have it all ways, Alison.
You can't be both the hero and the victim.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.960
[sighs] It should have been
a conversation.

34:48.043 --> 34:50.005
It was a conversation.

34:50.088 --> 34:53.549
And after that conversation,
we decided to be a family.

34:54.384 --> 34:55.510
She's my child.

34:56.386 --> 34:59.848
When you invite someone in,
it's your job to make 'em feel wanted.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.557
[sighs]

35:01.642 --> 35:03.476
Farah's happy.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.854
I'm happy. Sahar's happy.

35:07.355 --> 35:08.607
Come on, Al.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.150
Where's my girl?

35:13.737 --> 35:15.238
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:19.951 --> 35:20.952
Hey.

35:23.413 --> 35:24.665
Hey!

35:24.748 --> 35:25.957
[grunting]

35:26.041 --> 35:27.292
Where'd you come from?

35:28.209 --> 35:30.503
I'm an inmate.
And I've just broken out of prison.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.714
Oh, shit. [stammers] Okay.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.299
What are you gonna do with me?

35:34.382 --> 35:35.842
Uh... [sputters]

35:35.926 --> 35:37.844
Uh, I guess we'll, uh,
take you over to Max.

35:37.928 --> 35:40.088
That's what we did with
the rest who bolted. [chuckles]

35:41.431 --> 35:44.392
Come on. I'll get you a van.
So what's it like in there? Is it nuts?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.439
Yeah, this way.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.523
It's fine.

35:51.482 --> 35:54.712
Performance report. Performance report.
Why are there so many performance reports?

35:54.736 --> 35:57.572
How many reports does one man need
on his performance? My God!

35:57.656 --> 35:59.199
[inhales] Does your mouth feel dry?

35:59.282 --> 36:01.617
Uh, yeah. [sighs]

36:01.702 --> 36:03.494
Plus, it's moving in slow-mo.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.497
Hey, <i>mira.</i> Look!

36:06.581 --> 36:08.624
There's something here. I know it.

36:08.709 --> 36:09.710
[breathes deeply]

36:09.793 --> 36:12.337
But I can't concentrate
with that clock ticking so loud.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.590
[laughs] What clock?

36:15.674 --> 36:16.675
That cl...

36:19.302 --> 36:21.512
Huh. That's strange.

36:21.596 --> 36:22.889
No matter. Back to business.

36:22.973 --> 36:26.226
We're taking down that big warthog,
and then they'll all see.

36:27.102 --> 36:28.729
- See what?
- They'll just see.

36:28.812 --> 36:30.772
It's enough. That they see.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.648
[inhales deeply] Okay.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.486
Maybe there are
so many performance reports...

36:37.653 --> 36:39.447
because he's writing them himself.

36:40.866 --> 36:43.159
Or what if he stole someone's identity?

36:44.202 --> 36:45.847
- Or what if he was...
- He killed someone.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.622
- Yes, he would do that.
- No, really.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.333
He killed an inmate.

36:52.168 --> 36:53.628
"Inmate Rosado from D block

36:53.712 --> 36:56.297
was discovered unresponsive
in a running shower

36:56.381 --> 36:59.342
with full thickness burns
over 80% of his body.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.803
CO on duty at time of the incident...

37:02.220 --> 37:03.722
was Desi Piscatella."

37:08.059 --> 37:09.269
My God!

37:09.936 --> 37:11.396
A week later he was transferred.

37:11.479 --> 37:13.648
How did Caputo not know?

37:14.858 --> 37:17.652
What am I saying, of course he knew.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.529
Maybe it was an accident.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.490
[in Russian] There are no accidents.

37:23.699 --> 37:24.951
[in Spanish] You're right.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.119
Everything is a choice.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.328
[in English] Come on!

37:27.412 --> 37:31.958
Remember, you must keep
the circle unbroken.

37:32.042 --> 37:35.879
Whatever you do, do not break the circle.

37:35.962 --> 37:37.923
Hold up. What if we gotta pee?

37:38.590 --> 37:40.842
Do not break the circle.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.844
[Maureen inhales deeply]

37:43.469 --> 37:44.805
Poussey...

37:44.888 --> 37:46.181
[Suzanne sighs]

37:47.140 --> 37:48.934
we welcome you to this room.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.436
As we sit here...

37:52.187 --> 37:54.773
we make this a place of welcoming.

37:55.857 --> 37:59.861
Everyone, tell Poussey we welcome her.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.781
[all] We welcome you, Poussey.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.576
[Maureen] Taystee?

38:06.659 --> 38:08.453
She gets it. She welcome.

38:10.663 --> 38:15.043
Poussey, Suzanne is here to listen to you.

38:17.921 --> 38:19.047
Speak to her.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.258
Tell her what you want us to hear.

38:26.554 --> 38:30.516
She says... she's trying

38:30.600 --> 38:32.894
to feel a peach.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.148
Oh.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.111
Trying to feel at peace.

38:41.194 --> 38:42.195
[Brook sighs]

38:44.823 --> 38:46.509
[whispers]
Does she really believe this shit?

38:46.533 --> 38:47.742
[shushes]

38:47.826 --> 38:49.720
[whispers] Everybody got
their own way to grieve.

38:49.744 --> 38:51.454
She says she's not angry.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.415
But she's lost.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.459
[Maureen] How can
we help her find her way?

38:58.086 --> 39:00.630
She says she feels the throbbing of time.

39:02.924 --> 39:06.011
[stutters] A throbbing in a time machine.

39:07.262 --> 39:08.429
Oh, my God.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.141
That was our place.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.392
How did you know that?

39:12.475 --> 39:15.020
- Oh, please, like that's some big secret.
- [Brook] Wait.

39:15.103 --> 39:17.272
- Wait, what else?
- [Suzanne] No, I can't hear.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.275
- [breath trembling] What else?
- [stutters] Page 70. She says "Page 70."

39:22.652 --> 39:24.612
Maya Angelou.
She was her favorite.

39:24.695 --> 39:27.073
P's favorite book was <i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

39:27.157 --> 39:29.534
- No, it was Maya Angelou.
- Stop! Stop!

39:29.617 --> 39:30.911
Is... is she saying that?

39:30.994 --> 39:32.412
No, I'm saying that.
I can't hear!

39:34.664 --> 39:37.667
Quote... She says...
she says there's a quote.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.379
"You've got another love,
and I know it..."

39:41.462 --> 39:42.923
[muttering indistinctly]

39:46.217 --> 39:47.969
You're taking too damn long.

39:50.846 --> 39:54.184
Oh, yo!
"She'll cry and wonder.

39:55.476 --> 39:56.686
What went wrong?"

39:56.769 --> 39:58.396
[inhales sharply]

39:58.479 --> 40:01.274
See? Maya Angelou.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.736
[sobs] I am crying and wondering
what went wrong.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.280
We're all doin' that.

40:07.363 --> 40:11.201
You really think P would bother
to have us look that shit up in a book?

40:11.826 --> 40:15.080
She says... she misses you.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.582
[Brook sobs]

40:18.083 --> 40:22.003
[crying] Tell her I miss her, too.
So much.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.756
What makes you think she talking to you?

40:24.839 --> 40:26.424
Because she feels my grief!

40:26.507 --> 40:28.801
Oh, and she don't feel mine?

40:28.884 --> 40:30.761
- We was best friends!
- It's...

40:30.845 --> 40:33.389
You knew her for, like, five minutes
compared to me!

40:33.473 --> 40:35.976
It's not about quantity,
it's about connection!

40:36.059 --> 40:37.352
Well, we had both.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.812
Oh, shit, it's a grief-off.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.772
Sisters, please.

40:41.856 --> 40:46.152
This energy is not
spirit-friendly right now.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.629
You know what? Fuck this. I'm done.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.655
- No, you can't break the circle.
- Why?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.741
She already dead!

40:51.824 --> 40:54.827
And this... this Pagan bullshit
ain't gonna bring her back!

40:54.910 --> 40:57.247
There ain't no heaven,
and there ain't no ghosts, man!

I don't like <i>Idol</i> as much.

It's a better name. Let it go.

The pressure is...

Okay! That's like three intros already.
Can we get on with it?

Well done.
