00:00.010 --> 00:02.230
In all your years of dealing with the
dead and the dying and the bereaved,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.710
have you ever seen anything
that you could not explain?

00:04.760 --> 00:05.710
Never.

00:05.760 --> 00:08.270
Are you there? Are you with me?

00:08.320 --> 00:10.430
Gabriel drew a picture
of a woman with a book

00:10.480 --> 00:11.950
and so did Harriet.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.550
If you're suggesting that
my pursuit of the truth

00:14.600 --> 00:16.110
is in relation to Gabriel...

00:16.160 --> 00:17.390
Only you can answer that.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.430
God help me, I see the dead

00:19.480 --> 00:22.510
and I have to understand
why this is happening!

00:22.560 --> 00:26.710
You are transgressing
against God and nature.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.590
- Another one of us gone.
- Where does it all end, Gideon?

00:29.640 --> 00:31.070
What do they say about me?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.790
They say you're raising the dead.

00:32.840 --> 00:34.430
Daddy!

00:34.480 --> 00:37.230
Where are you, Daddy?

00:37.280 --> 00:39.400
Nathan? Nathan?

00:40.520 --> 00:42.260
Are you there?

00:42.640 --> 00:44.830
I will protect you.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.420
But can you protect our child?

01:40.760 --> 01:42.870
This was supposed to be a surprise.

01:42.920 --> 01:43.910
I am surprised!

01:43.960 --> 01:47.430
- I wasn't expecting this!
- I'm beginning to suspect that

01:47.480 --> 01:49.710
whoever constructed this crate

01:49.760 --> 01:52.630
did so with the intention
of it withstanding theft

01:52.680 --> 01:55.800
and fire and acts of God.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.350
See, that's what first
attracted me to you.

02:06.400 --> 02:11.039
Beautiful and so adept with a chisel!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.240
A crib!

02:20.000 --> 02:21.540
I love it!

02:28.960 --> 02:33.310
And things like this are what
first attracted me to you,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.560
my wonderful Mr Appleby.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.100
Thank you.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.380
What, you're leaving?!

03:08.880 --> 03:10.870
Unless you've got something
else I haven't seen,

03:10.920 --> 03:12.310
don't see much cause for staying.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.110
I've never had any
complaints from the lasses.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.350
Reckon I'm more particular

03:16.400 --> 03:18.310
than the usual rubbish you've been having.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.830
Rubbish?!

03:20.880 --> 03:23.020
I'll give you rubbish!

03:40.880 --> 03:42.480

You know the stories of the
Allhallows Massacre, we all do,

04:57.920 --> 05:01.510
about how the Roundhead
army rode on Shepzoy

05:01.560 --> 05:05.550
with their muskets and swords,
slaughtering all before them.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.710
Killed every man, woman
and child, they did.

05:09.760 --> 05:14.670
And those that tried to flee were
given the worst death of all,

05:14.720 --> 05:18.870
hunted down and strung up
in the trees by their necks,

05:18.920 --> 05:20.750
gutted like pigs.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.390
And there were that
many hanging in the woods

05:23.440 --> 05:25.630
that the ground was sodden with blood.

05:25.680 --> 05:31.360
And it was Allhallows time when
it happened, just like now.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.630
Gwen didn't see it! He was just
sitting on the floor in the woods,

06:02.680 --> 06:04.510
he was that terrified,

06:04.560 --> 06:06.950
just going on about what he'd seen.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.870
A woman, strung up in the
tree by her neck, she was,

06:10.920 --> 06:12.630
her guts hanging out.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.670
That's what the engineer saw.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.630
It's an omen, that they're coming for us.

06:17.680 --> 06:22.270
- All the railway boys are saying so.
- Well, of course they are!

06:22.320 --> 06:25.270
Them railway lads -- townies,
every last one of them.

06:25.320 --> 06:29.030
You put them in the woods at night

06:29.080 --> 06:32.480
and they'll tell you they
seen Lucifer himself.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.550
Thought you'd got more sense, Maud Hare,

06:36.600 --> 06:39.270
taking heed of stories like that!

06:41.120 --> 06:43.230
Just telling you what I heard, that's all.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.580
Well, some nonsense is
best kept to yourself.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.710
Mr Smith.

06:49.760 --> 06:51.950
Can't you at least tell
me what she looked like,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.350
this woman you saw hanging?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.400
- No, Mr Appleby, I cannot.
- Mr Smith.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.830
Mr Smith!

07:01.040 --> 07:04.430
It is of the utmost importance
that I know what occurred.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.790
- Where did you see this event?
- In the copse.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.710
By the old swing.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.080
Yes?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.790
Sorry, Mr Appleby, I...

07:13.840 --> 07:17.030
I have not the stomach to
revisit what I saw last night,

07:17.080 --> 07:18.150
now or ever again.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.070
- Mr Smith...
- I have travelled the length

07:20.120 --> 07:24.120
of our great empire with the
railway, but this place...

07:25.320 --> 07:27.860
There is something wrong here.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.800
Something very, very wrong.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.590
They can't just suspend work.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.070
They can, they have.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.030
- For how long? - Until they can find
new workers willing to come here,

07:43.080 --> 07:45.470
which Smith reckons won't be
easy, not when word spreads

07:45.520 --> 07:47.390
about the things that have been occurring.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.030
What if they can't find new workers?

07:49.080 --> 07:50.830
The railway will chart
an alternative route,

07:50.880 --> 07:52.820
bypassing our land.

07:54.600 --> 07:57.340
Well, damn them! Damn the railway!

07:58.560 --> 08:01.910
We can survive without their money.
The harvest fetched a good price,

08:01.960 --> 08:04.430
- we don't need them.
- It feels like every time

08:04.480 --> 08:08.580
we make any progress, something
intervenes to thwart us.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.230
It's to be expected, all this --

08:12.280 --> 08:14.950
the farm, the fields,
it's unfamiliar territory.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.390
I'm not talking about that,

08:16.440 --> 08:18.710
I'm talking about something more sinister.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.510
Whatever Smith saw last night

08:20.560 --> 08:23.510
was so terrible he would
not stay another night.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.760
What he imagined he saw.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.310
It was late and dark and the copse is...

08:30.360 --> 08:32.350
unsettling even in daylight.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.309
But being wilfully blind to
what's occurring around us

08:35.360 --> 08:37.299
is not a solution.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.750
These events will continue
without our intervention.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.110
I am not being wilfully blind.

08:44.159 --> 08:46.830
I accept what I see, that is all.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.750
You're concerned, I see that,

08:49.800 --> 08:52.390
but I cannot believe that
every ill that befalls us

08:52.440 --> 08:54.640
is the work of a ghost.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.600
We must focus on the
farm, on the future...

09:01.800 --> 09:04.040
.. for us and our child.

09:49.760 --> 09:53.150
Ma'am, would you...
would you like a smile?

09:53.200 --> 09:57.270
I think that would detract from
the sense of Allhallows, Gideon!

09:57.320 --> 09:58.710
Well, what about a scowl?

09:58.760 --> 10:00.750
Arghh!

10:00.800 --> 10:03.150
No, as you are is fine.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.350
- Is everyone ready?
- Yeah.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.040
Three... two... one.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.590
Toby!

10:14.640 --> 10:16.480
Toby!

12:07.720 --> 12:09.060
Nathan!

12:10.280 --> 12:12.280
You're just in time.

12:12.880 --> 12:15.820
One photograph, that's all I'm asking.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.180
All right.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.030
Everybody ready?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.070
- Yes.
- Ready.

12:51.520 --> 12:55.400
Three... two... one.

13:00.200 --> 13:01.230
Perfect.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.630
Is that it, ma'am?

13:04.680 --> 13:06.270
Yes, you're all done.

13:06.320 --> 13:10.240
I'll take this off, then.

13:49.440 --> 13:53.030
I'm coming, Mummy's coming.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.910
- Harriet.
- Mr Appleby.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.310
I need your assistance
in an important matter.

15:16.360 --> 15:17.790
Of course.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.470
But... I am expected home.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.310
- Perhaps it could hold
until tomorrow? - No,

15:21.360 --> 15:22.710
this is very important, Harriet,

15:22.760 --> 15:25.760
it requires your attention this evening.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.070
I'm sure your parents
will forgive your tardiness

15:29.120 --> 15:32.060
when they hear you've been helping me.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.040
You remember how we did this before?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.390
Yes.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.710
Good.

16:24.680 --> 16:28.180
I want you to concentrate
on the watch, Harriet.

16:35.360 --> 16:37.760
Look steadily at the watch.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.020
Let everything else fade away.

17:29.760 --> 17:33.640
Invite her to come forward
and make her presence felt.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.000
Tell her I know she's been
causing all these hauntings.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.590
Tell her that. Tell her I've seen her.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.040
In the woods, in the house.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.640
You know who I'm talking about.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.790
You know who this woman is, you saw her.

17:51.840 --> 17:53.980
You... you drew her...

17:55.400 --> 17:57.470
.. in this very room.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.640
Ask her what she wants.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.990
Ask her, Harriet.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.440
Ask her.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.200
Ask her.

18:34.520 --> 18:36.630
I'm going to wake you up now, Harriet.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.630
- When I get to the number...
- They're coming for you.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.110
Nathan, they're coming for you.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.360
Who?

18:45.280 --> 18:47.020
Who is coming?

18:48.120 --> 18:50.190
Harriet!

18:50.240 --> 18:52.640
What do they want? Harriet!

19:19.280 --> 19:22.070
If what the engineer saw
last night is nonsense,

19:22.120 --> 19:24.460
then why are they leaving?

19:25.120 --> 19:28.880
Railway's not just gonna pack up
and go without cause, is they?

19:36.040 --> 19:38.640
The bottle on the left, Lizzie.

20:54.840 --> 20:58.510
Appleby letting the railway go
is bad for the whole village.

20:58.560 --> 21:00.830
Mr Nathan knows what he's doing.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.750
The Applebys have always wanted

21:02.800 --> 21:05.670
the best for this community at heart.

21:06.840 --> 21:09.790
I reckon the railway boys
got more sense than we have,

21:09.840 --> 21:11.470
leaving here while they still can.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.920
A dose of the wanderlust, Maud?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.270
No.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.990
But I've got two eyes in my head

21:19.040 --> 21:21.070
and I can see what's going on around here.

21:21.120 --> 21:22.660
We all can.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.580
None of it's any good.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.910
Anyway, I'd rather leave now
than end up like your Jack,

21:28.960 --> 21:32.600
buried up in Cain's Field with not
so much as a cross above his head.

21:35.360 --> 21:39.240
But if I had a mind to, where
would we go? This is our home.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.630
You'd find somewhere new.

21:45.720 --> 21:49.820
Somewhere where you're not
living side by side with evil.

22:18.480 --> 22:19.750
Gwen?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.680
- Ma'am.
- Who did this?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.390
Er, Mr Appleby, ma'am.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.980
He was here with Miss Harriet.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.040
It's the pig's blood, ma'am.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.630
What were they doing?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.960
I don't know, ma'am.

22:45.560 --> 22:48.720
But nothing good comes from
inviting the dead back in your life.

23:12.840 --> 23:14.430
Where were you?

23:14.480 --> 23:17.720
I met Mr Appleby in the
village and was delayed.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.510
He escorted me all the
way home, I wasn't alone.

23:22.560 --> 23:25.360
Harriet, did something happen?

23:27.840 --> 23:31.390
You look perished. Are you all right?

23:31.440 --> 23:33.640
What happened, Harriet?

23:33.960 --> 23:35.360
Tell me!

23:37.280 --> 23:38.910
You should never have involved her!

23:38.960 --> 23:40.750
After all that time you spent curing her,

23:40.800 --> 23:44.510
- to drag her back into this business again.
- But it was not in vain!

23:44.560 --> 23:47.110
Harriet told me they're coming for me.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.070
Who is coming?

23:49.120 --> 23:52.630
I believe it's this woman, it's
this ghost that I've been seeing.

23:52.680 --> 23:54.110
Clarity Winlove.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.360
No, it's another woman.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.070
I understand.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.590
- You're sceptical.
- Just stop now.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.350
But she's real, I saw her again today.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.630
If I could show you the things
I've seen, then you'd believe me!

24:09.680 --> 24:11.390
Amazing things!

24:11.440 --> 24:13.380
Impossible things.

24:15.520 --> 24:18.230
The woman carries a book with
photographs of this house,

24:18.280 --> 24:20.750
but they are moving as if the
photographs have come to life

24:20.800 --> 24:23.350
and then there is a voice in
the photograph, a woman's voice,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.590
and she is calling out
Charlie's name and Peter Hare

24:25.640 --> 24:29.540
- and all the others.
- I'm worried about you, Nathan.

24:29.600 --> 24:32.070
This obsession isn't healthy.

24:35.120 --> 24:38.240
Why don't we get away to
London for a few days, just us?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.740
No, we can't leave.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.950
- Not now.
- Why not?

24:45.000 --> 24:46.870
The harvest is sold, we can see friends

24:46.920 --> 24:48.710
and visit the theatre and galleries,

24:48.760 --> 24:51.270
it'd be like a tonic. Just a
few days, that's all I'm asking,

24:51.320 --> 24:53.790
and then we can return
rested and clear-headed.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.580
Please, please.

24:56.520 --> 24:57.860
For me.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.780
Very well.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.430
That you'd use my daughter
to commune with the dead!

25:09.480 --> 25:11.510
My 16-year-old daughter!

25:11.560 --> 25:13.030
It was a grave error of judgment

25:13.080 --> 25:14.630
- and we accept that.
- No,

25:14.680 --> 25:16.710
it was an unforgivable
betrayal of our friendship.

25:16.760 --> 25:17.910
I meant no harm,

25:17.960 --> 25:20.190
I was merely trying to put
an end to these hauntings.

25:20.240 --> 25:25.870
I don't care. You do not now involve
my daughter in your misadventures!

25:25.920 --> 25:26.910
You're right,

25:26.960 --> 25:30.460
it was unforgivable.
Nathan's sorry, aren't you?

25:45.440 --> 25:47.950
Why would anyone set fire to a tree?

25:48.000 --> 25:51.000
I don't know, but I intend to find out.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.150
If it burns out now, you
won't find it in the dark.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.750
Please don't go now, Nathan.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.160
- Please?
- Very well.

26:04.520 --> 26:09.120
First thing in the morning, you
and I will investigate, Denning.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.870
You came.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.110
Only to satisfy my own curiosity.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.630
Well, there's nothing here,

26:56.680 --> 26:58.790
there's no scorch marks,
there's no charred wood,

26:58.840 --> 27:01.710
there's no evidence of any kind that
there was a fire here last night.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.080
- Then we must be searching the wrong field.
- No, it was here!

27:07.160 --> 27:09.560
We saw it, Charlotte saw it.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.630
If there are no remains, it can't
have been here, it's impossible.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.430
Well, of late, I've witnessed many things

27:15.480 --> 27:16.870
I'd once have called impossible.

27:16.920 --> 27:19.790
Please tell me we are not
discussing the supernormal again!

27:19.840 --> 27:23.310
- If that's what you care to call it.
- I believe in God and man

27:23.360 --> 27:25.030
and very little in between!

27:25.080 --> 27:27.310
Then explain how there is
not a trace of this tree

27:27.360 --> 27:29.550
we saw blazing so brightly last night.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.540
We just haven't found the remains yet.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.480
And we will.

27:35.440 --> 27:36.980
You'll see.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.230
Yes?

28:11.280 --> 28:14.430
Ma'am, the food is hot and ready
to be taken into the fields.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.640
I thought it best we take them out
while they're still piping, ma'am.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.950
Of course, you're right. We should.

28:24.000 --> 28:27.000
- I'll be down presently.
- Yes, ma'am.

28:41.360 --> 28:42.910
You'll find nothing

28:42.960 --> 28:45.910
because what we saw was not
an actual tree on fire,

28:45.960 --> 28:47.470
it was just another of these events

28:47.520 --> 28:49.270
that have been haunting this village.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.870
- Listen to me, Denning...
- Take your hand off me!

28:52.920 --> 28:55.310
I know you're angry with me
for involving Harriet in this,

28:55.360 --> 28:57.670
but don't let your anger blind
you to what's happening!

28:57.720 --> 29:00.720
I believe I know what's behind all this.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.390
There's a woman.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.430
The ghost, I have mentioned it to you.

29:04.480 --> 29:06.750
She has been present
from the very beginning,

29:06.800 --> 29:08.510
throughout all these hauntings.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.470
Listen. I've even heard her

29:10.520 --> 29:13.640
reciting the names of Charlie
Thatcher, Peter Hare and Harriet.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.110
Are you suggesting this ghost

29:18.160 --> 29:21.830
is orchestrating all these
other supernormal events?

29:21.880 --> 29:24.990
Yes, she is the thread that
is tying everything together.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.230
I'm certain of it.

29:26.280 --> 29:28.080
That is insane.

29:29.640 --> 29:32.790
Well, so is a tree that burns
but leaves no trace behind!

29:32.840 --> 29:34.550
These events will continue and escalate

29:34.600 --> 29:35.990
unless we intervene to stop her.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.750
- Intervene how?
- An exorcism,

29:37.800 --> 29:40.230
to banish her and all the
evil spirits from Shepzoy.

29:40.280 --> 29:42.830
Our Church forbids exorcisms,

29:42.880 --> 29:45.110
except in the most
extraordinary circumstances.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.830
Without one, there will be no
respite from these disturbances.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.680
My answer is no!

29:50.520 --> 29:53.550
Then she will continue to
orchestrate these hauntings.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.540
She will not cease.

29:56.200 --> 29:58.400
Not unless we stop her!

30:06.160 --> 30:07.990
Gwen?

30:08.040 --> 30:10.310
Do you believe in ghosts?

30:11.400 --> 30:15.350
Not sure "ghosts" is
the word I'd use, but...

30:15.400 --> 30:18.680
I do believe this world is inhabited
by more than just man and beast.

30:20.720 --> 30:24.590
Is it the dead, do you think,
their spirits lingering?

30:24.640 --> 30:26.800
Yes, ma'am. I do.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.500
Ma'am!

31:12.760 --> 31:13.790
Ma'am!

31:13.840 --> 31:15.070
- Ma'am!
- What is it?

31:15.120 --> 31:16.230
In the fields!

31:16.280 --> 31:19.630
Horses, soldiers, spirits!

31:20.960 --> 31:22.470
Be gone, be gone!

31:22.520 --> 31:24.720
- Hurry!
- Look, ma'am!

31:48.000 --> 31:51.280
Aaargh!

32:14.480 --> 32:18.120
Maud, where are you going?

32:19.360 --> 32:20.430
Away from here!

32:20.480 --> 32:21.590
No, Maud!

32:21.640 --> 32:23.150
You know what this is!

32:23.200 --> 32:27.590
Allhallows Eve, when the
Roundheads rode on Shepzoy.

32:27.640 --> 32:31.150
They slayed every man, woman and child.

32:31.200 --> 32:34.470
They strung them up from
the trees by their necks.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.030
Look!

32:36.080 --> 32:37.640
Look at me!

32:40.240 --> 32:45.230
That's what Smith the engineer
saw, the woman in the woods.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.830
She was strung up and cut open!

32:47.880 --> 32:51.430
It won't stop until they've shed blood.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.390
My advice is to get away from here.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.310
Get as far away from here as you can!

33:16.000 --> 33:18.000
What is it you want?

33:20.760 --> 33:22.160
Tell me.

33:25.560 --> 33:26.960
Tell me.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.680
No, Nathan! Stop!

34:29.159 --> 34:31.699
I searched the whole hillside.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.550
Nothing, not a single scrap to
prove the fire ever existed.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.270
Perhaps the wind scattered the ashes?

34:37.320 --> 34:39.590
You forgot these, Father.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.639
Er, thank you, Harriet.
Put them in the sacristy.

34:49.719 --> 34:53.270
A tree that size does not burn
itself out without leaving a trace.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.909
There must be an explanation for it.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.630
Well, that is my belief too.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.220
Everything can be explained...

35:00.200 --> 35:03.600
.. if not by faith, then
by science and reason.

35:05.480 --> 35:09.000
I'm a sceptic when it comes to
matters of the occult, but... this...

35:10.520 --> 35:13.260
You don't think that's what it is?

35:13.920 --> 35:16.150
I don't know what to think.

35:16.200 --> 35:19.440
Help us! Let us in!

35:20.480 --> 35:21.880
Please!

35:24.350 --> 35:25.350
Wait here.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.640
Please! Please!

36:13.520 --> 36:15.630
- It's all right.
- Really?

36:15.680 --> 36:18.320
There's no-one there.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.060
- Harriet?
- Harriet!

36:24.760 --> 36:26.600
Help me!

36:28.360 --> 36:29.760
Help me!

36:30.800 --> 36:31.910
Harriet!

36:31.960 --> 36:34.480
- Oh, my God!
- Harriet!

36:36.200 --> 36:38.390
Oh, God! God!

36:38.440 --> 36:40.310
What's happening?

36:41.200 --> 36:42.540
Please!

36:44.960 --> 36:46.630
Do something!

36:47.680 --> 36:50.510
She's choking!

36:50.560 --> 36:51.550
Harriet!

36:51.600 --> 36:54.840
Hurry, Matthew! Please hurry!

36:56.080 --> 36:57.950
Harriet!

36:58.000 --> 37:00.750
She's choking, Matthew, quick!

37:00.800 --> 37:05.080
In the name of the
Father and of the Son...

37:06.360 --> 37:08.760
.. and of the Holy Ghost...

37:13.440 --> 37:16.480
It's fine. You're going to be fine.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.350
Take Harriet home.

37:20.400 --> 37:25.320
Lock the doors and don't
open them until I return.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.630
Where will you be?

37:27.680 --> 37:30.980
There is something I
must attend to... alone.

37:37.480 --> 37:41.350
The circumstances we face
require extreme measures.

37:41.400 --> 37:42.870
You will perform the exorcism?

37:42.920 --> 37:45.910
I warn you, I have no
experience of such matters.

37:45.960 --> 37:48.110
You are doing the right thing.

37:48.160 --> 37:51.070
This will defeat this woman and
whatever evil she's brought here.

37:51.120 --> 37:52.800
Nathan!

37:54.120 --> 37:58.230
There are apparitions in the woods,
unexplainable visions and noises.

37:58.280 --> 38:01.030
The workers are frightened, as am I.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.960
You've seen them?

38:04.160 --> 38:05.430
You've seen them.

38:05.480 --> 38:07.720
Yes. I'm sorry.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.830
I will go and reassure the
workers and I will tell them

38:17.880 --> 38:20.960
- that we are putting an end
to these disturbances. - How?

38:22.200 --> 38:24.870
Denning will perform an exorcism.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.220
This will be an end to it all.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.420
All of you!

38:37.320 --> 38:38.510
Go home!

38:38.560 --> 38:40.830
Lock your doors!

38:40.880 --> 38:43.070
Reverend Denning is about
to perform a ceremony

38:43.120 --> 38:47.710
that will lift this darkness that
has been hanging over Shepzoy.

38:47.760 --> 38:51.000
Do you believe all this is the
work of ghosts and the dead?

38:53.400 --> 38:56.630
I know only this -- that I have
seen terrible, unexplainable things

38:56.680 --> 38:59.870
and whatever hand is
behind them must be stopped.

38:59.920 --> 39:03.990
When you awake in the morning,
peace and calm will be restored.

39:04.040 --> 39:07.470
But do you only banish the evil
spirits and not the benign?

39:07.520 --> 39:10.270
I have no room for such distinctions.

39:10.320 --> 39:13.280
All that is present must be cast out.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.270
Hurry, now! Go!

39:20.320 --> 39:23.520
It is imperative if Shepzoy
is to have any peace.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.800
- Are we ready to begin?
- Almost.

39:37.360 --> 39:39.990
Come on! Quick!

39:40.040 --> 39:43.200
Quick! Let's get in. Come on!

39:46.000 --> 39:48.440
Lock it, Simon, lock it!

39:49.800 --> 39:51.540
Use the cellar.

39:52.360 --> 39:53.990
Quick! Get going!

39:54.040 --> 39:59.990
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and of the Holy Ghost,

40:00.040 --> 40:01.800
I cast you out!

40:03.560 --> 40:05.300
Unclean spirit!

40:08.000 --> 40:11.990
With every Satanic power of the enemy,

40:12.040 --> 40:14.840
every spectre from hell.

40:16.320 --> 40:20.160
In the name of Jesus Christ, be gone!

40:21.880 --> 40:25.640
And stay far from these
creatures of God...

40:28.400 --> 40:33.630
.. for it is he who created the
Earth and said, "Let there be light,"

40:33.680 --> 40:37.270
for it is he who commands you,

40:37.320 --> 40:40.950
he who cast the serpent from the garden,

40:41.000 --> 40:45.390
he who formed man from
the dust of the ground

40:45.440 --> 40:48.680
and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life...

40:50.200 --> 40:53.070
.. and the man became a living being.

40:54.800 --> 40:58.750
He who flung you from the heights
of heaven, into the depths of hell.

41:05.000 --> 41:10.600
He who rained down burning
sulphur on Sodom and Gomorrah...

41:13.400 --> 41:18.430
.. and inflicted ten plagues
on the house of Egypt.

41:18.480 --> 41:23.470
He who is all-powerful

41:23.520 --> 41:27.390
and whose might is indestructible,

41:27.440 --> 41:31.480
who will smite the forces
of evil without mercy.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.790
Do you hear that?

41:42.080 --> 41:44.220
The gunfire's stopped.

41:46.280 --> 41:47.950
It's working.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.150
For it is he who commands you,

41:51.200 --> 41:56.280
he who once stilled a sea
and the wind and the storm.

42:05.040 --> 42:06.510
'Daddy!'

42:14.600 --> 42:16.000
'Daddy.'

42:17.520 --> 42:19.030
'Daddy!'

42:19.080 --> 42:21.710
Ignore it, Nathan. It's a trick!

42:21.760 --> 42:25.390
That is not your son. The
Devil takes on many forms.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.350
- 'Daddy, where are you, Daddy?'
- I'm...

42:28.400 --> 42:29.790
- 'Daddy!'
- I'm here.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.150
'Daddy!

42:31.200 --> 42:33.340
'Where are you, Daddy?

42:35.480 --> 42:37.880
'I want you to play with me.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.710
'Play with me, Daddy.

42:42.880 --> 42:45.960
'Why won't you ever play with me?'

42:47.080 --> 42:51.670
Harken and tremble in fear,
Satan, you enemy of faith.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.670
- 'I'm going to sail my boat.'
- You foe

42:54.720 --> 42:57.750
of the human race, corrupter of men.

42:57.800 --> 43:01.270
I need to show you something
now, something very important.

43:01.320 --> 43:02.670
Nathan!

43:02.720 --> 43:06.400
You corrupter of justice,
you... you root of all evil.

43:23.840 --> 43:26.230
That's Gabriel, that's...

43:26.280 --> 43:27.750
his boat.

43:29.680 --> 43:33.180
How is it possible that
he's in this photograph?

43:33.920 --> 43:37.550
When I developed it yesterday,
he wasn't, but this morning...

43:37.600 --> 43:40.030
You've known since this morning?

43:40.080 --> 43:42.600
You said nothing.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.910
I was going to tell you.

43:45.960 --> 43:47.720
When exactly?!

43:50.120 --> 43:53.310
You... You had this and you
deliberately kept it from me,

43:53.360 --> 43:55.350
- an unforgivable lie!
- No.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.430
Then why didn't you show
this to me immediately?

43:57.480 --> 43:59.150
I don't... know.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.390
You don't know what -- how
important this might be to me?!

44:02.440 --> 44:04.230
Proof that Gabriel is present,

44:04.280 --> 44:06.630
his... his... his spirit is still here.

44:06.680 --> 44:08.420
Still present!

44:09.520 --> 44:10.790
Stop!

44:10.840 --> 44:12.190
You must stop this now!

44:12.240 --> 44:13.470
Stop this ceremony!

44:13.520 --> 44:16.150
My... My son is here! Gabriel is here!

44:18.600 --> 44:19.630
Look!

44:22.480 --> 44:26.430
No, he's here, Denning! And I will not
risk banishing him with this ceremony.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.310
Consider what you are doing!

44:28.360 --> 44:30.100
My mind is set!

44:30.480 --> 44:33.790
This community has paid a terrible
price because of these hauntings

44:33.840 --> 44:36.070
and it will pay an even greater one

44:36.120 --> 44:39.240
- if we do not stop them now!
- I cannot allow it!

44:46.600 --> 44:47.990
We must crucify this man.

44:48.040 --> 44:49.750
He has slain!

44:49.800 --> 44:52.510
You get out of my house!

44:52.560 --> 44:54.190
Nathan!

44:54.240 --> 44:56.230
- You are not welcome here, Denning!
- Appleby,

44:56.280 --> 44:59.080
- consider what you're doing!
- Go!

45:04.120 --> 45:07.190
I am warning you, if you
do not leave here now,

45:07.240 --> 45:09.580
I will take my gun to you.

46:12.960 --> 46:15.000
Do you hear that?

46:21.920 --> 46:23.590
I have to think of Gabriel.

46:23.640 --> 46:25.280
He is dead!

46:28.960 --> 46:30.900
He's still my son.

47:12.520 --> 47:14.790
Forgive me my trespassers,

47:14.840 --> 47:18.510
as I forgive him for
trespassing against me,

47:18.560 --> 47:23.230
for thine is the kingdom and the
power and the glory for ever...

47:23.280 --> 47:24.620
Hello?

47:26.280 --> 47:28.750
- Help!
- Is anybody there?!

47:58.600 --> 47:59.940
Hello?!

48:03.080 --> 48:04.430
Hello?!

50:01.400 --> 50:03.140
They have gone.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.240
- Maud!
- Maud!

50:37.520 --> 50:38.790
Maud!

50:40.440 --> 50:41.710
Here!

50:44.840 --> 50:46.110
Maud!

50:48.360 --> 50:50.430
This way. There she is!

50:50.480 --> 50:53.120
Maud! Maud!

50:56.080 --> 50:57.470
Maud?

50:57.520 --> 50:58.790
Maud!

51:20.760 --> 51:23.040
I feel him...

51:28.880 --> 51:32.520
.. all around me.

51:34.480 --> 51:35.820
Nathan!

51:37.160 --> 51:38.900
What happened?

51:43.840 --> 51:46.710
They found Maud's body in the forest.

51:47.360 --> 51:49.950
It must have happened last night.

51:50.000 --> 51:51.430
What I don't understand is,

51:54.760 --> 51:56.100
Yes...

51:58.920 --> 52:01.750
I... I decided not to proceed with the...

52:01.800 --> 52:03.270
ceremony.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.520
Why, sir?

52:09.080 --> 52:12.350
I had good reasons, very good reasons.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.470
Very important ones and...

Give me my son!

52:44.040 --> 52:47.870
None of them will work for us
again, you do realise that?!

52:47.920 --> 52:49.470
Answer me!

52:49.520 --> 52:51.720
You must have heard him!

52:52.800 --> 52:54.030
He's here.

52:54.080 --> 52:56.470
Gabriel is here, right now.

52:56.520 --> 52:58.190
I know he is.

52:59.720 --> 53:03.630
You can see him in the photograph.
Look, you can't deny it.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.080
- I just want him to
leave us alone! - No! No!

53:22.840 --> 53:23.980
No!

54:33.800 --> 54:35.740
Have you seen him?

54:35.840 --> 54:37.380
No, ma'am.

54:39.520 --> 54:44.310
You should leave Shepzoy
now, ma'am. It would be best,

54:44.360 --> 54:47.720
for you and the baby, to
get far, far away from here.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.870
It's not good for you here.

54:50.920 --> 54:53.150
I can't leave, Gwen.

54:53.200 --> 54:56.600
I'd go with you, you
wouldn't have to be alone.

54:56.920 --> 55:00.000
I can't abandon my husband, not now.

55:03.960 --> 55:06.150
You can leave if you want.

55:06.200 --> 55:09.640
No. I'm not going to abandon you.

56:01.440 --> 56:04.630
You took me for a ghost of my former self.

56:04.680 --> 56:08.080
Them that's gone got
fainter hearts than some.

56:09.680 --> 56:11.150
Thank you.

56:11.200 --> 56:15.790
There is something wrong with your
mind and your heart and your soul.

56:15.840 --> 56:20.630
It's you pulling others
into your unhappiness!

56:20.680 --> 56:21.950
Me? A lost soul?

56:22.000 --> 56:24.140
I must find a way out.

56:25.040 --> 56:26.470
Gabriel!

56:26.520 --> 56:29.470
I am not here to be punished!
