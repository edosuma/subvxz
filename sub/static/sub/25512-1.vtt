WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:06.006
[♪♪♪]

00:14.536 --> 00:15.667
It's a big day.

00:15.711 --> 00:16.581
Good luck, son.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.366
Thank you for coming.

00:22.283 --> 00:23.545
[laughing nervously]

00:25.547 --> 00:27.331
I'm having
trouble breathing.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.332
I'm breaking out.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.247
He'll understand, right?

00:34.077 --> 00:35.296
Oh...

00:36.775 --> 00:38.516
[bride]: I don't know
what's wrong with me.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.388
I love him...
I really do.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.477
There's a wedding
about to happen.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.521
I know.

00:43.565 --> 00:44.392
You're in it.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.523
Oh...

00:45.567 --> 00:46.742
Okay, it's okay.

00:46.785 --> 00:47.743
You don't have to.

00:47.786 --> 00:48.744
I'm sure
he'll understand.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.093
I'm horrible.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.094
No, you're not.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.443
You're a good person.

00:52.487 --> 00:53.792
It's okay.

00:55.098 --> 00:56.056
Do you want to do this?

00:56.099 --> 00:57.057
I...

01:01.713 --> 01:02.714
Do you?

01:02.758 --> 01:04.194
I do...

01:04.238 --> 01:05.543
not.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.762
Go... Go, go!

01:09.765 --> 01:12.289
Oh, Charlotte...

01:20.341 --> 01:22.473
[church bells ringing]

01:49.718 --> 01:51.633
Hey. Thanks for coming.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.122
[pastor]:
Please be seated.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.648
Friends,

02:06.691 --> 02:08.824
we have joined here today

02:08.866 --> 02:10.608
to share
with James and Charlotte

02:10.651 --> 02:12.828
in holy matrimony.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.309
In their time together,

02:15.352 --> 02:17.485
they have seen their love

02:17.528 --> 02:19.269
and their understanding
of each other

02:19.313 --> 02:22.446
grow and blossom,

02:22.490 --> 02:24.187
and now have decided

02:24.231 --> 02:26.276
to live out
the rest of their lives

02:26.320 --> 02:28.278
as one.

02:29.279 --> 02:30.237
Do you,

02:30.280 --> 02:31.803
James Cooper,

02:31.847 --> 02:35.416
take Charlotte
to be your wife?

02:35.459 --> 02:36.852
I do.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.769
Do you, Charlotte Bennett,

02:40.812 --> 02:42.553
take James to be
your husband?

02:44.555 --> 02:46.166
Charlotte?

02:48.429 --> 02:49.517
Do you?

02:51.562 --> 02:52.737
I do...

02:57.394 --> 02:59.353
not.

03:01.877 --> 03:02.878
[James, sighing]: Again?

03:08.623 --> 03:10.364
[rain spattering]

03:12.279 --> 03:13.236
Charlotte!

03:14.237 --> 03:15.195
I'm so sorry.

03:35.476 --> 03:36.781
Good morning!

03:36.825 --> 03:39.219
Hi!

03:39.262 --> 03:40.872
Everything looks good.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.415
Looking good.

04:02.503 --> 04:03.721
Oh, Charlotte, my dear.
Take a look.

04:03.765 --> 04:04.940
Tell me what you think.

04:06.768 --> 04:07.725
I love it.

04:07.769 --> 04:08.726
Good.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.858
I'm going to do

04:09.901 --> 04:11.642
an entire collection
for the wedding.

04:11.686 --> 04:12.948
The wedding?

04:12.991 --> 04:13.949
Great!

04:13.992 --> 04:14.950
Great...

04:14.993 --> 04:15.994
That's great.

04:20.521 --> 04:21.522
Okay...

04:24.960 --> 04:26.004
What do you think?

04:26.048 --> 04:28.442
Okay, it's ridiculously
expensive,

04:28.485 --> 04:30.792
but how many times does a girl
get to be Maid of Honor

04:30.835 --> 04:32.707
three times
with the same bride?

04:34.317 --> 04:35.449
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no.

04:35.492 --> 04:37.712
Charlotte?

04:37.755 --> 04:39.061
The wedding's
still 30 days away.

04:41.455 --> 04:44.284
You just have to get over
the actual wedding part.

04:44.327 --> 04:45.589
Think about
everything

04:45.633 --> 04:46.982
you have going on in
your life right now.

04:47.025 --> 04:48.462
You have a meeting

04:48.505 --> 04:50.420
with the editor-in-chief
of Chocolate Monthly Magazine

04:50.464 --> 04:52.814
with the chance of winning
their next big contest.

04:52.857 --> 04:55.338
You have plans to
open your next shop,

04:55.382 --> 04:56.861
not to mention the hype

04:56.905 --> 04:58.298
around creating
your next, big flavor

04:58.341 --> 04:59.777
which no one's ever tasted
before.

04:59.821 --> 05:00.778
I mean, compared
to all that,

05:00.822 --> 05:02.606
this wedding thing?

05:02.650 --> 05:04.304
It's a piece of cake.

05:04.347 --> 05:05.479
Bad reference.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.872
The point is, it'll be easy.

05:07.916 --> 05:10.440
Achieved
with very little effort.

05:10.484 --> 05:11.702
Presenting few difficulties.

05:11.746 --> 05:12.703
Adjective.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.748
See?

05:15.097 --> 05:16.359
You're doing that
define the word thing you do

05:16.403 --> 05:18.056
without even knowing you do it,

05:18.100 --> 05:19.406
that James finds so cute

05:19.449 --> 05:20.842
and everyone else
finds annoying.

05:20.885 --> 05:21.973
It's a sign.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.584
He does think
it's cute, doesn't he?

05:23.627 --> 05:24.759
Mm-hmm.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.630
And he's handling
everything wedding,

05:26.674 --> 05:28.850
so all you have to do
is show up and say, "I do..."

05:29.981 --> 05:31.418
again.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.474
Hello, beautiful.

05:48.043 --> 05:51.046
Oh, let me
get this here...

05:53.962 --> 05:54.963
What?

05:56.094 --> 05:57.052
That look on your face.

05:57.095 --> 05:58.749
What look?

05:58.793 --> 06:01.404
Of absolute trepidation.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.363
You're not...

06:03.406 --> 06:04.712
Just hear me out.

06:04.755 --> 06:05.930
You are.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.715
You're the one...

06:07.758 --> 06:08.716
I knew it.

06:08.759 --> 06:09.717
And what happened...

06:09.760 --> 06:11.196
twice...

06:11.240 --> 06:14.374
had nothing to do with you or us
or anything like that.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.115
And we've been
over all that,

06:17.159 --> 06:18.856
but it's all in
the past, right?

06:18.900 --> 06:20.423
Right.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.729
Yeah, I love you.

06:21.772 --> 06:23.818
I love you, too.

06:23.861 --> 06:26.386
I love you more than anyone
in the whole world,

06:26.429 --> 06:27.648
and...

06:27.691 --> 06:30.433
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you,

06:30.477 --> 06:32.870
and have a family with you,

06:32.914 --> 06:34.089
and grow old with you,

06:34.132 --> 06:35.699
and...

06:35.743 --> 06:37.440
But...?

06:37.484 --> 06:39.007
No buts.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.184
Okay, there's a but.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.577
Look, I don't know
what it is, James, okay?

06:43.620 --> 06:45.709
It's like I've developed
some sort of...

06:45.753 --> 06:47.407
hyper-sensitivity to weddings,

06:47.450 --> 06:49.626
and not just
our own wedding, okay?

06:49.670 --> 06:51.498
When I go to a friend's wedding,
I just... I don't know...

06:51.541 --> 06:53.151
it's like I literally break out
into hives or something.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.414
You know?

06:54.457 --> 06:56.807
I mean,
ours is a month away,

06:56.851 --> 06:58.635
and I'm already starting
to get the itch.

06:59.767 --> 07:01.464
Okay, a hyper-sensitivity
to weddings,

07:01.508 --> 07:03.901
which causes you
to break into hives?

07:03.945 --> 07:07.427
You do know that's not
physically possible, right?

07:07.470 --> 07:09.037
Well, says who?

07:09.080 --> 07:11.692
Says any reasonable
person, Charlotte.

07:11.735 --> 07:14.999
I'm a reasonable person.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.914
Until you start
over-thinking things.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.916
I mean, you analyze
and calculate

07:18.960 --> 07:20.875
and ponder
every possibility

07:20.918 --> 07:24.487
instead of just letting things
be what they are...

07:24.531 --> 07:25.706
which works
great for your business

07:25.749 --> 07:28.926
and your masterful
chocolate creations,

07:28.970 --> 07:31.538
but not...
in a relationship.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.540
I know.

07:33.583 --> 07:34.932
It's all set.

07:34.976 --> 07:36.194
I've planned everything.

07:36.238 --> 07:37.631
I haven't even mentioned
the word "wedding".

07:37.674 --> 07:40.503
I've been calling it
the "exchange of vows" day.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.504
Yeah...

07:41.548 --> 07:42.636
It's paid for.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.594
Guests have
been invited.

07:45.987 --> 07:47.031
I just...

07:47.075 --> 07:49.033
can we just... just...

07:49.077 --> 07:50.600
wait...

07:50.644 --> 07:51.688
a teensy-weensy bit longer?

07:53.647 --> 07:56.084
I think I've been
a teensy-weensy bit patient

07:56.127 --> 07:57.128
already.

08:01.176 --> 08:02.960
You left me
at the altar...

08:03.004 --> 08:04.179
twice...

08:05.572 --> 08:07.530
and guess what,
I understood why.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.792
I mean,

08:08.836 --> 08:10.098
you were taking over
the chocolate factory.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.013
Business was booming.
It was busy times.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.147
You were amazing.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.499
I can't go
through it again.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.893
James, it's just a phobia,
okay?

08:22.937 --> 08:24.373
I'll get over it.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.114
I'm going to work on it,
and I am going to get over it.

08:26.157 --> 08:27.724
Look...

08:27.768 --> 08:29.639
I told you, I don't
want to elope, okay?

08:29.683 --> 08:30.901
I want a wedding.

08:30.945 --> 08:32.642
I want a grand wedding,

08:32.686 --> 08:33.817
like the one
I've always dreamed of.

08:33.861 --> 08:38.561
Yes, guys dream
of weddings, too.

08:38.605 --> 08:42.086
Not in a park, or on a beach,

08:42.130 --> 08:43.087
but in a church.

08:43.131 --> 08:46.830
Like I wanted to
the first time.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.006
with someone...

08:49.050 --> 08:52.096
who wants to get married,

08:52.140 --> 08:54.055
not just be married.

08:56.710 --> 08:57.928
Goodbye.

09:06.154 --> 09:08.112
Are you ready to order?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.114
We have an amazing
dessert today.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.725
It's a chocolate tart
made right here in town

09:11.768 --> 09:13.553
at Charlotte
And Her Chocolate Factory.

09:15.337 --> 09:16.556
Oh, my gosh.
It's you.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.560
Yeah... yeah, it's me.

09:28.611 --> 09:31.701
[♪♪♪]

09:41.668 --> 09:46.194
[♪♪♪]

09:51.765 --> 09:56.030
[♪♪♪]

10:04.908 --> 10:05.909
I'm so sorry.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.824
She's never late.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.783
Remind me of
your name again?

10:09.826 --> 10:10.827
Hannah Reid.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.350
I'm the factory manager,

10:12.394 --> 10:13.787
and her best friend.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.658
You're sure she knew
the meeting was today?

10:15.702 --> 10:16.790
Mm-hmm.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.661
I'm just going
to give her a call again.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.706
Good idea.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.101
Charlotte!

10:24.145 --> 10:25.712
It's me, again.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.148
Ms. Sweeney is here?

10:27.191 --> 10:29.672
Founder and Editor in Chief
of Chocolate Monthly,

10:29.716 --> 10:31.935
soon to name
America's best chocolate...

10:31.979 --> 10:33.676
ring a bell?

10:33.720 --> 10:34.938
She's waiting...

10:34.982 --> 10:36.940
patiently.

10:36.984 --> 10:38.899
Where are you?

10:41.292 --> 10:42.293
She'll be here.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.776
[Charlotte]:
I couldn't get out of bed!

10:46.820 --> 10:48.125
I totally forgot!

10:48.169 --> 10:50.214
Was she mad?

10:50.258 --> 10:51.128
No, actually,

10:51.172 --> 10:52.390
she was very nice
about it.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.391
What did you tell her?

10:53.435 --> 10:54.392
Food poisoning.

10:54.436 --> 10:56.046
Ugh...

10:56.090 --> 10:57.700
I'm so miserable without him.

10:57.744 --> 10:58.832
Then be with him.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.877
It's just
the wedding.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.792
If getting married
is your greatest fear,

11:02.836 --> 11:04.751
then let it scare you.

11:04.794 --> 11:07.144
Just don't let James know
it scares you.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.145
What do you mean?

11:08.189 --> 11:09.277
There's an old saying...

11:09.320 --> 11:11.148
the definition of courage

11:11.192 --> 11:13.237
is being the only one
who knows you're afraid.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.674
Mind over matter.

11:14.717 --> 11:15.675
That's it.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.721
What if
I break out again?

11:18.765 --> 11:19.722
Tell him it's pollen!

11:19.766 --> 11:20.767
I...

11:20.810 --> 11:21.768
Do you love him?

11:21.811 --> 11:23.204
Of course I do.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.727
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life with him?

11:24.771 --> 11:26.163
I do.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.687
Do you want
to have a family with him

11:27.730 --> 11:29.689
and laugh with him
and cry with him

11:29.732 --> 11:30.428
and grow old with him?

11:30.472 --> 11:31.734
I do!

11:31.778 --> 11:33.388
See how easy it is to say,
"I do"?

11:33.431 --> 11:34.824
Yes!

11:34.868 --> 11:38.001
Yes, I just have to
prove it to him, right?

11:38.045 --> 11:39.916
I have to find
the right words, you know?

11:39.960 --> 11:41.178
So he'll hear the
sincerity, right?

11:41.222 --> 11:42.702
He'll know it's
different this time.

11:42.745 --> 11:45.008
Yes! Do it!

11:45.052 --> 11:46.270
But what if...

11:46.314 --> 11:47.315
Go! Conquer!

11:48.272 --> 11:49.404
Just don't
wear that.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.115
Hi!

12:07.291 --> 12:08.379
Hi.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.860
You busy?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.383
Just, you know,
the usual.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.384
Servicing these
helicopters

12:13.428 --> 12:15.952
never seems to end,
you know?

12:15.996 --> 12:17.258
Yep.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.054
Any luck?

12:31.098 --> 12:32.099
My grandfather's convertible?

12:32.142 --> 12:33.796
No, um....

12:33.840 --> 12:34.928
I got a tip from somebody

12:34.971 --> 12:36.364
that said that it was sold

12:36.407 --> 12:37.800
to a guy in California
who restores and sells them,

12:37.844 --> 12:41.151
so... still kind of hoping
it pops up.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.936
Well, I know your grandfather
would be really proud

12:42.979 --> 12:44.894
that you're trying so hard
to find it again.

12:44.938 --> 12:45.895
Yeah.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.418
Five years.

12:47.462 --> 12:48.811
Haven't given up yet, so...

12:48.855 --> 12:50.944
It'll happen.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.818
What's up, Charlotte?

12:56.993 --> 12:58.429
You didn't come here
to talk about my family,

12:58.473 --> 12:59.430
did you?

12:59.474 --> 13:01.258
I really need
an oil change.

13:01.302 --> 13:03.130
Oil change?

13:03.173 --> 13:05.393
Huh.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.524
I changed it a month ago.

13:06.568 --> 13:08.875
I have been doing
a lot of driving.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.964
6,000 miles?

13:11.007 --> 13:12.792
-Maybe.
-Wow.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.794
Do you have money?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.360
What, you're charging me now?

13:16.404 --> 13:18.885
I'll give you a coupon.

13:18.928 --> 13:20.190
I didn't...

13:20.234 --> 13:22.279
I didn't come here
to get an oil change,

13:22.323 --> 13:25.456
but the word "change"
is important.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.415
Look, I've changed,
okay, James?

13:27.458 --> 13:28.459
I can see.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.287
I can see that
this, this fear,

13:30.331 --> 13:32.333
it's irrational maybe,
of the whole wedding thing,

13:32.376 --> 13:33.377
but I mean,
this time,

13:33.421 --> 13:35.205
you really showed me,
you know?

13:35.249 --> 13:38.469
I am over the fear.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.384
Do you still want to marry me?

13:43.344 --> 13:45.085
I do...

13:46.869 --> 13:49.176
not.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.179
I deserve that, yeah,

13:52.222 --> 13:54.877
and you deserve to be mad,

13:54.921 --> 13:57.140
but listen,
in 30 days,

13:57.184 --> 13:58.489
I am going to be
at that altar.

13:58.533 --> 14:01.057
Okay, look,
Charlotte...

14:01.101 --> 14:02.102
I love you...

14:03.190 --> 14:04.278
but...

14:04.321 --> 14:05.322
there's a reason

14:05.366 --> 14:06.584
you haven't gone through
with it.

14:09.544 --> 14:10.501
I'll be there!

14:10.545 --> 14:11.589
You'll see.

14:14.505 --> 14:15.855
I canceled everything,
Charlotte, okay?

14:15.898 --> 14:19.032
Church, guests,
caterers, all of it.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.861
There's nowhere for you
to be in 30 days.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.167
Sorry.

14:27.910 --> 14:28.868
Yeah.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.391
'Kay.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.048
I'm not going to let him
be the one who got away.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.919
That's rich.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.442
Look, I know
my track record, okay,

14:38.486 --> 14:40.880
but I can see clearly now.

14:40.923 --> 14:42.011
The rain is gone,

14:42.055 --> 14:43.012
and you can see
all obstacles

14:43.056 --> 14:44.187
in your way.

14:44.231 --> 14:47.060
Gone are the dark clouds
that had me blind.

14:47.103 --> 14:48.061
Okay, ha-ha.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.279
You laugh,

14:49.323 --> 14:51.020
but I'm going
to make him believe in me.

14:51.064 --> 14:52.543
How?

14:52.587 --> 14:53.893
It's so obvious.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.198
The wedding.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.547
One slight hiccup...

14:56.591 --> 14:58.462
you said he already canceled
the wedding...

14:58.506 --> 14:59.637
everything.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.944
So I'm going
to uncancel it.

15:01.988 --> 15:04.381
No, no, no, no,
I'm going to...

15:04.425 --> 15:05.687
I'm going to do
better than that.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.297
I'm going to give him
the wedding of his dreams.

15:07.341 --> 15:10.561
I'm going to organize it
and design it,

15:10.605 --> 15:13.608
and most importantly,
I'm going to be there.

15:13.651 --> 15:15.001
Yeah.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.046
In 30 days,

15:17.090 --> 15:21.616
I'm going
to say "I do!"

15:23.661 --> 15:25.663
[mother, on Skype]: I'm sorry
for not taking you seriously,

15:25.707 --> 15:26.969
but James is right.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.492
You won't go through with it.

15:28.536 --> 15:29.667
Just promise you'll come.

15:29.711 --> 15:31.974
Real estate
is booming in New York.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.541
I hardly have
a minute to myself,

15:33.584 --> 15:35.412
much less another trip
across the country

15:35.456 --> 15:37.023
to watch you say you won't.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.589
I won't.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.504
You know, if your father was still alive,

15:40.548 --> 15:42.637
he would agree with me.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.986
You're a lovely girl, Charlotte.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.163
You're just not meant
to get married.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.209
It's a new age, dear.

15:49.252 --> 15:51.951
Spinster doesn't have
the same stigma it used to.

15:51.994 --> 15:52.952
Uh...

15:52.995 --> 15:54.388
Bad connection, Mom,
got to go.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.389
Call me any time.

15:55.432 --> 15:56.390
Love you.

15:56.433 --> 15:57.391
Love you.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.306
Spinster...

16:00.350 --> 16:01.656
So...

16:03.310 --> 16:04.615
Planning a wedding?

16:04.659 --> 16:05.616
Planning a wedding.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.357
Right, yeah.

16:07.401 --> 16:08.358
Let's make a list.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.534
List...
yes, good.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.623
Wedding dress.

16:12.667 --> 16:13.973
Wedding dress!

16:14.016 --> 16:14.974
You already
have one...

16:15.017 --> 16:15.975
two.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.367
I didn't keep them.

16:18.412 --> 16:20.370
You're only supposed
to wear them once, right?

16:20.414 --> 16:21.545
Number three
was only a month away.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.634
You didn't shop for a dress?

16:23.678 --> 16:25.114
I was putting it off.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.203
Okay, now you're going
to be putting it on.

16:27.247 --> 16:28.335
So that's number one.

16:29.771 --> 16:31.164
Venue... church.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.556
What church did he want,
same one?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.689
Yeah, yeah, James never wanted
to do it outside.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.386
Book the church.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.215
Flowers, new invites...

16:39.259 --> 16:41.130
everyone's going to need
to be told it's back on.

It just... it just gushes.

So do you.

17:13.554 --> 17:14.685
You would look dashing.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.731
Oh, best not to use
the word "dash".

17:18.079 --> 17:20.082
Well, there is a number
of selections upstairs.

17:20.126 --> 17:22.301

Hi.

Your delivery van
is due for maintenance.

last week?

It's not allergy season.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.741
It is somewhere.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.482
So how did it go?

18:12.526 --> 18:14.049
How did what go?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.398
Didn't you have a meeting
with the lady from the magazine

18:15.442 --> 18:16.617
yesterday?

18:16.660 --> 18:17.792
Yes, but no.

18:17.835 --> 18:19.446
I wasn't feeling well,

18:19.489 --> 18:20.534

Ah...
well, good luck.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.755
I meant
what I said.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.584

at the altar this time.

how you do it,

At least I spend
most of my days

19:17.547 --> 19:18.809
in a publishing office.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.856
Well, it's actually not
a problem these days.

19:21.899 --> 19:22.987
I physically can't eat it

some sort of reaction.

the flavors,

19:31.735 --> 19:33.389

by smell.

I'm kind of
a chocolate sommelier.

Well, we have our own farm
in South America,

20:20.480 --> 20:21.916
and then the beans
are imported fresh,

20:21.959 --> 20:24.658
and they are cooked, mixed,
and melted here.

How do you derive
your unique flavors?

20:26.747 --> 20:28.531
Um, there's no exact formula.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.706
It's more instinct.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.055
A dabble here, a dabble there,

20:31.099 --> 20:32.883
maybe a little cross-breed
this bean with that.

20:32.927 --> 20:33.928
It's instinct.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.364
It's a gift.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.410
Picasso...
Mozart...

20:38.454 --> 20:39.760
and Charlotte.

20:39.803 --> 20:40.891
Nicole, this is Oscar.

20:40.935 --> 20:42.502
It's very nice
to meet you.

20:42.545 --> 20:43.590
This is his shop.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.287
Was his shop.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.680
Yes, well...

20:46.723 --> 20:47.594
I worked for Oscar
for 10 years,

20:47.637 --> 20:49.248
and then
I bought it from him

20:49.291 --> 20:50.379
two years ago.

20:50.423 --> 20:51.946
I've had a love
for all things chocolate

20:51.989 --> 20:53.817
ever since the very first time
I went trick-or-treating.

20:53.861 --> 20:55.819
I even went as a chocolate bar
one year.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.517
Anyway, um,

20:57.560 --> 20:59.475
Oscar taught me
everything I know.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.869
She taught me
all the things I didn't.

21:01.912 --> 21:05.264
If God allowed me
to pick a granddaughter,

21:05.307 --> 21:06.743
it would be this young lady.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.618
That's very sweet.

21:11.661 --> 21:12.880
Yeah, well,
Oscar hand-makes everything,

21:12.923 --> 21:15.274
so he really is the Picasso.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.579
Ah, but it's the flavors

21:16.623 --> 21:19.408
that has those people
lined up outside the door.

21:19.452 --> 21:21.976
Me, I'm just an extension
of her brush.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.543
Well, these look great.

21:23.586 --> 21:24.718
Okay,
thank you.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.285
So tell me more

21:26.328 --> 21:27.677
about this new flavor
you're coming up with.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.288
Oh, it's
a salty-sweet combination

21:29.331 --> 21:30.506
with a couple
of twists.

21:30.550 --> 21:31.507
I'm still in
the testing phase,

21:31.551 --> 21:32.552
but it's getting
really close.

21:32.595 --> 21:33.814
I think it's going

21:33.857 --> 21:35.294
to be one of our most
popular flavors yet.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.904
Well, have you thought
of expanding?

21:36.947 --> 21:38.732
Oh, yes,
a second store to start,

21:38.775 --> 21:39.776
and then my ultimate dream

21:39.820 --> 21:41.561
is to have
a shop in Times Square.

21:41.604 --> 21:42.518
Silly.

21:42.562 --> 21:43.911
No, not at all,

21:43.954 --> 21:46.522
and if you win this contest,
anything's possible,

21:46.566 --> 21:48.742
and it's perfect timing.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.352
Open up another shop,

21:50.396 --> 21:52.441
get people in other markets
excited about your current line,

21:52.485 --> 21:55.357
and then, when your buzz
is at an all time high,

21:55.401 --> 21:57.316
you knock it out of the park
with your new chocolate.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.839
Well, that's the plan.

21:59.883 --> 22:02.799
This is something
I take very seriously.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.366
The competition
is stiff.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.976
I've been traveling
all over the country.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.805
So I would like to stay here
for a few days,

22:08.849 --> 22:09.937
get to know the
people who come here,

22:09.980 --> 22:11.504
your employees...

22:11.547 --> 22:13.027
Yeah, that
would be amazing.

22:13.070 --> 22:15.508
Um, this is James, my fian...

22:15.551 --> 22:16.422
mechanic.

22:16.465 --> 22:17.379
He does all our mechanical...

22:17.423 --> 22:19.338
mechanic... stuff.

22:19.381 --> 22:20.991
James, this is...

22:21.035 --> 22:21.992
Nicole?

22:22.036 --> 22:23.385
Jimmy!

22:23.429 --> 22:24.430
Wow.

22:26.562 --> 22:27.694
It's been...

22:27.737 --> 22:29.043
a while.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.044
Wait, what?

22:30.087 --> 22:31.654
You look great.

22:31.698 --> 22:34.353
Not the same girl
you let get away, huh?

22:34.396 --> 22:35.528
Let get away?

22:35.571 --> 22:36.790
It's great to see you.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.531
Great to see you.

22:38.574 --> 22:39.706
Charlotte, this is...

22:39.749 --> 22:41.360
Nicole, yeah.

22:41.403 --> 22:42.665
Yeah. I'm aware of that.

22:42.709 --> 22:44.537
I just introduced her to you.

22:44.580 --> 22:45.929
Yeah, no, um...

22:47.627 --> 22:49.368
that Nicole.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.021
That Nicole?

22:51.065 --> 22:53.372
I know...
it's crazy, right?

22:53.415 --> 22:54.068
Yeah...

22:54.111 --> 22:55.374
I had no idea

22:55.417 --> 22:57.114
you were the lady
from the magazine, right?

22:57.158 --> 22:58.855
That's me.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.727
I rebranded it
as Chocolate Monthly,

23:00.770 --> 23:03.033
and everything
just fell into place

23:03.077 --> 23:05.427
after... you and I broke up.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.647
Yeah.

23:09.431 --> 23:11.041
Well, it's great to see you.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.087
Absolutely delightful.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.612
I have some phone calls to make.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.746
We have
a lot to talk about, Charlotte.

23:19.789 --> 23:21.400
Jimmy,
we do, too.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.445
I'm staying
at the Starboard Inn.

23:23.489 --> 23:24.446
Tootles.

23:24.490 --> 23:25.491
Tootles!

23:27.928 --> 23:29.973
Jimmy?

23:30.017 --> 23:31.584
Yeah.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.542
Small world, huh?

23:33.586 --> 23:34.978
Tiny.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.549
The same Nicole Sweeney,

23:40.593 --> 23:42.638
one of the world's most
renowned chocolate connoisseurs?

23:42.682 --> 23:44.597
That's the Nicole
he was dating before you?

23:44.640 --> 23:46.903
I only knew
her as Nicole.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.731
Wow, for someone
who doesn't like chocolate,

23:48.775 --> 23:50.472
he sure can pick 'em,
can't he?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.082
It's like God
laughing at me

23:52.126 --> 23:54.694
for leaving him
at the altar...

23:54.737 --> 23:56.739
twice.

23:56.783 --> 23:59.438
And she has no idea
about the two of you?

23:59.481 --> 24:00.743
No, and I don't
want to tell her.

24:00.787 --> 24:01.918
Why not?

24:01.962 --> 24:04.138
Because it'll complicate
the competition.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.009
Besides, you know
how some women can be.

24:06.053 --> 24:08.055
She'll see me as the one
who stole James's heart.

24:08.098 --> 24:09.752
You mean,
broke his heart?

24:09.796 --> 24:11.493
I mean, if
she finds out

24:11.537 --> 24:12.755
and thinks I'm some
terrible person,

24:12.799 --> 24:13.930
then what is she
supposed to think

24:13.974 --> 24:15.628
about my "fantastic
creations"?

24:15.671 --> 24:16.890
I mean, you've seen her.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.065
She's gorgeous...

24:18.108 --> 24:19.675
which is so
confusing to me

24:19.719 --> 24:20.676
because James
always described her

24:20.720 --> 24:21.938
as being
so... plain.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.593
Men always say that
about ex-girlfriends.

24:24.637 --> 24:25.812
Doesn't mean anything.

24:26.987 --> 24:27.770
Okay, so what?

24:27.814 --> 24:28.858
She's his ex.

24:28.902 --> 24:31.470
It was, what, like,
five years ago?

24:31.513 --> 24:32.775
He's in love with you.

24:32.819 --> 24:33.994
[breathing heavily]

24:35.996 --> 24:38.041
No, I'm good.

24:38.085 --> 24:39.390
I don't get it.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.131
I could walk through
a whole poppy field in Oz,

24:41.175 --> 24:43.003
but wedding flowers...

24:43.046 --> 24:44.483
[sneezing]

24:44.526 --> 24:45.614
Mind over matter.

24:45.658 --> 24:46.963
Mind over matter.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.008
Yes.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.668
[Nicole]:
Hello? Jimmy?

25:00.542 --> 25:03.066
So out of all of the
chocolate factories

25:03.110 --> 25:05.068
in all of the world...

25:05.112 --> 25:07.244
Yeah.

25:07.288 --> 25:08.637
You really didn't know
I live around here, huh?

25:08.681 --> 25:11.161
Not at all.
I've never been.

25:11.205 --> 25:12.641
I've never met Charlotte either.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.077
She seems
like a sweet girl.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.602
Yeah, yeah,
very.

25:16.645 --> 25:18.081
Look at you.

25:18.125 --> 25:20.519
Your business has really...

25:20.562 --> 25:21.781
taken off.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.045
Right.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.699
But you're still doing
odd jobs

25:26.742 --> 25:28.831
like fixing delivery trucks?

25:28.875 --> 25:31.660
Yeah, you know,
I just...

25:31.704 --> 25:34.184
I like to help out
where I can.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.796
How loyal.

25:36.839 --> 25:37.840
Heh.

25:37.884 --> 25:38.972
So how have you been?

25:39.015 --> 25:40.364
Great.

25:40.408 --> 25:43.063
Like I said, the magazine
is going really well.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.586
Good.

25:44.630 --> 25:46.022
That's good.

25:46.066 --> 25:49.286
Uh, small talk
is just so awkward, isn't it?

25:49.330 --> 25:51.288
We have so much
to get caught up on.

25:53.639 --> 25:55.945
I thought you were engaged
a couple of years ago.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.643
Uh...

25:57.686 --> 25:59.862
I was.

25:59.906 --> 26:02.604
Uh, am, or...

26:02.648 --> 26:03.823
I was.

26:03.866 --> 26:06.260
You were, or you are?

26:06.303 --> 26:07.609
I was.

26:07.653 --> 26:08.610
So, single then?

26:08.654 --> 26:10.307
You know, it's complicated.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.874
I like complicated.

26:11.918 --> 26:13.049
Ha...

26:13.093 --> 26:14.224
Let's grab dinner.

26:14.268 --> 26:16.705
Yeah, that would be
complicated, too.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.141
Come on,
what are the chances

26:18.185 --> 26:19.229
of us running into each other
like this?

26:19.273 --> 26:20.274
It's fate.

26:21.623 --> 26:23.843
I feel like I'm giving
up all my secrets here,

26:23.886 --> 26:25.845
but...

26:25.888 --> 26:27.281
I've missed you, James.

26:27.324 --> 26:30.719
We haven't seen each other
in five years, Nicole.

26:30.763 --> 26:32.634
All the more reason.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.029
Look, I just...

26:36.072 --> 26:37.073
I can't right now.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.293
I'm swamped
with everything, and...

26:39.336 --> 26:41.251
it's great to see you.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.212
So then coffee, tomorrow.

26:48.302 --> 26:49.782
Yeah, okay.

26:49.825 --> 26:51.610
Sure. Coffee.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.654
Great.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.355
There is no such thing
as being allergic to weddings.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.879
You haven't seen it.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.141
I have a garden.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.012
I grow flowers.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.274
Flowers decorate
my office,

27:04.318 --> 27:05.319
but wedding flowers?

27:05.362 --> 27:07.756
I can't stop
itching.

27:07.800 --> 27:09.628
Dress materials,

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
pollen
in certain flowers,

27:10.716 --> 27:11.760
food allergens
in a cake, maybe,

27:11.804 --> 27:13.936
but weddings, no.

27:13.980 --> 27:15.372
The only thing
you're allergic to

27:15.416 --> 27:16.678
is chocolate.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.767
Yeah, and isn't that
a cruel joke?

27:18.811 --> 27:20.726
Look, Charlotte,

27:20.769 --> 27:23.032
whatever is going on with you
when it comes to these weddings,

27:23.076 --> 27:25.208
it's all in your head.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.080
It's a physical reaction--

27:27.123 --> 27:28.821
the same thing that happens
when I eat chocolate--

27:28.864 --> 27:30.170
so what's what, Doc?

27:30.213 --> 27:31.911
It's psychosomatic.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.086
A physical illness

27:33.129 --> 27:34.696
caused or aggravated
by a mental factor

27:34.740 --> 27:36.263
such as internal conflict
or stress. Adjective.

27:36.306 --> 27:38.787
So is that, by the way.

27:42.182 --> 27:44.140
[Nicole]: You know,
when I first read the article

27:44.184 --> 27:45.794
about your chocolate

27:45.838 --> 27:47.796
and how it was
sweeping the area,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.015
and how people
would drive hours

27:49.058 --> 27:51.017
just to come
and have a taste,

27:51.060 --> 27:53.323
that was only half
the story for me.

27:53.367 --> 27:56.109
Your profile was
what impressed me,

27:56.152 --> 27:57.850
the story behind the flavor...

27:57.893 --> 27:59.852
this young, vibrant woman,

27:59.895 --> 28:01.157
following
her passions,

28:01.201 --> 28:02.419
with business smarts

28:02.463 --> 28:05.205
that could rival
any CEO in the country...

28:05.248 --> 28:06.815
but what hooks me

28:06.859 --> 28:07.990
was your reason
for expanding,

28:08.034 --> 28:10.210
so that more people
could experience

28:10.253 --> 28:13.169
the joy of your creation.

28:13.213 --> 28:15.868
Yeah, it's a bit hokey,
though, huh?

28:15.911 --> 28:16.869
Mm-mm, no.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.435
It's authentic.

28:18.479 --> 28:20.699
So you really think
I have a chance?

28:20.742 --> 28:21.917
My little factory

28:21.961 --> 28:23.005
against
all the big chocolate giants

28:23.049 --> 28:24.354
out there?

28:24.398 --> 28:27.140
If your new flavor
lives up to your reputation,

28:27.183 --> 28:28.141
you have a real shot.

28:28.184 --> 28:30.752
Great, um...
fantastic!

28:30.796 --> 28:32.711
I'll walk you out.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.365
I like you, Charlotte.

28:35.409 --> 28:37.324
I feel like you and I
could be good friends.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.761
Let's go out, hang.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.763
Okay. Sure.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.460
Could I ask your advice
on something else,

28:43.504 --> 28:44.984
girl to girl?

28:45.027 --> 28:46.028
Of course.

28:46.072 --> 28:47.377
How well do you
know Jimmy?

28:47.421 --> 28:48.422
James.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.466
I mean, I know
he works for you,

28:49.510 --> 28:50.729
but other than that.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.427
Oh, I'd say
pretty well.

28:53.470 --> 28:55.821
He just seems so...

28:55.864 --> 28:57.257
unhappy.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.475
He does?

29:00.173 --> 29:02.218
Clearly, he's still jilted
by his ex-girlfriend,

29:02.262 --> 29:05.439
or ex-fiancée,
whatever she was.

29:05.482 --> 29:07.789
I think he's
still engaged.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.095
That's not what he said.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.227
Oh, he didn't?

29:11.271 --> 29:12.272
What did he say?

29:12.315 --> 29:13.969
I went to his place
earlier today.

29:14.013 --> 29:16.755
It's clear
he still has his walls up.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.235
He didn't go into detail,
but a woman can tell,

29:19.279 --> 29:21.107
especially as well
as I know him.

29:21.150 --> 29:25.502
She must have been a very,
very manipulative woman.

29:25.546 --> 29:28.897
Well, I heard that
she was very, very nice,

29:28.941 --> 29:31.204
and that she loves...
loved him a lot.

29:31.247 --> 29:32.901
Like, a lot, a lot.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.076
What about you?

29:34.120 --> 29:35.295
What do you mean?

29:35.338 --> 29:36.426
He's attractive.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.211
You're... cute.

29:39.299 --> 29:40.517
I'm not butting in,
am I?

29:40.561 --> 29:41.954
Butting in?

29:41.997 --> 29:43.782
He doesn't know it yet,

29:43.825 --> 29:46.219
but I intend
on winning him back,

29:46.262 --> 29:47.263
and I thought, well,

29:47.307 --> 29:48.264
maybe you could talk to him

29:48.308 --> 29:50.876
and convince him
people change.

29:52.486 --> 29:54.227
Oh, I knew we were going
to be friends.

29:56.142 --> 29:57.099
If I thought I was stealing
your man,

29:57.143 --> 29:58.797
I would be mortified.

30:02.975 --> 30:04.803
Me too.

30:04.846 --> 30:05.804
Yeah.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.336
[door buzzing]

30:22.429 --> 30:23.952
[door buzzing]

30:26.172 --> 30:27.434
Good morning.

30:27.477 --> 30:30.132
Yeah, it's, uh...

30:30.176 --> 30:32.178
6:30 in the morning.

30:32.221 --> 30:33.570
Oh, is it?

30:34.528 --> 30:35.834
Sorry.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.923
I'm having some car trouble.

30:37.966 --> 30:38.967
I brought coffee.

30:39.011 --> 30:40.403
Oh.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.362
Great.

30:55.157 --> 30:58.073
So, what's wrong
with your car?

30:59.335 --> 31:00.597
It's making
a strange noise.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.512
Mm.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.993
A strange noise.

31:05.037 --> 31:06.255
What kind of noise?

31:06.299 --> 31:08.910
I don't quite know
how to describe it.

31:08.954 --> 31:10.564
Mm-hmm.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.392
It's not really making
a noise at all, is it?

31:12.435 --> 31:13.523
No.

31:13.567 --> 31:14.524
Okay, I just
wanted to talk.

31:14.568 --> 31:15.569
And it couldn't have waited?

31:15.612 --> 31:16.570
No.

31:16.613 --> 31:17.876
I have to ask
you something.

31:17.919 --> 31:20.182
Well, okay,
ask away.

31:20.226 --> 31:22.184
Nicole.

31:22.228 --> 31:24.230
Is there still, like,
a thing between you two?

31:25.622 --> 31:27.102
What?
No, I...

31:27.146 --> 31:29.104
She thinks
there is.

31:29.148 --> 31:30.192
I doubt it.

31:30.236 --> 31:33.239
Why didn't you
tell her about us?

31:33.282 --> 31:34.414
Look, I just...

31:34.457 --> 31:36.938
I know how she can be,

31:36.982 --> 31:39.288
and unfortunately,

31:39.332 --> 31:41.073
it could jeopardize
your chances

31:41.116 --> 31:43.423
of winning
the contest...

31:43.466 --> 31:44.511
but look...

31:45.555 --> 31:48.907
there is nothing
between the two of us.

31:48.950 --> 31:51.300
You mean...
the two of you?

31:53.302 --> 31:54.913
Yeah.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.001
But obviously,

31:56.044 --> 31:59.613
we should keep us
to ourselves, right?

32:01.006 --> 32:03.225
Well, I mean,
that's up to you, okay?

32:03.269 --> 32:05.227
but knowing Nicole,

32:05.271 --> 32:07.012
yeah, that's probably
for the best.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.578
Okay.

32:08.622 --> 32:09.579
Okay?

32:09.623 --> 32:10.841
Okay.

32:10.885 --> 32:14.497
Now I'm going to go
get ready for the day.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.325
Thank you for that.

32:22.549 --> 32:23.985
Invites are
going out soon.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.205
Everything's
moving forward.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.423
I'll believe it
when I see it.

32:27.467 --> 32:28.685
I'm counting on that.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.122
-Okay.
-Okay.

32:30.165 --> 32:31.297
Bye.

32:37.564 --> 32:41.611
[♪♪♪]

32:50.011 --> 32:51.143
All right...

32:53.623 --> 32:54.668
Mm...

32:54.711 --> 32:56.365
Needs a dash of something.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.671
All right.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.020
You know, with the new bean,

32:59.064 --> 33:00.979
it's derived from
four different cocoa beans.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.415
The planters
thought I was crazy.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.720
You are.

33:03.764 --> 33:05.331
But it's going to be magical!

33:06.593 --> 33:09.030
All right, I think
I'm ready to run it.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.553
Yeah, I'm ready to run it.

33:10.597 --> 33:12.468
Okay, I'm going to lower
the temperature by one-third.

33:12.512 --> 33:13.730
I'm going to add
a couple more ingredients

33:13.774 --> 33:14.993
once it's conched.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.168
If you could just
finish stirring that.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.996
-I will do that.
-Fantastic.

33:20.172 --> 33:22.043
Okay, small hiccup.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.436
James's church
is not available,

33:23.479 --> 33:25.133
but I have a list
of other options.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.613
What? No, it has to be
at his church.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.093
It's very important to him.

33:28.136 --> 33:29.659
Okay, no need for panic.
I'll put it back on our to-do.

33:29.703 --> 33:31.009
Also, we have
some other items

33:31.052 --> 33:32.010
that need decisions.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.012
-Date night?
-Date night.

33:34.055 --> 33:35.404
-I'll see you at your house?
-Yeah.

33:35.448 --> 33:36.449
Okay.

33:37.711 --> 33:38.973
She's a good friend.

33:39.017 --> 33:41.280
Yeah, I don't know
what I'd do without her--

33:41.323 --> 33:42.672
speaking of which...

33:42.716 --> 33:44.718
are you still willing
to walk me down the aisle?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.027
I haven't given up on you yet.

33:50.419 --> 33:51.377
Great. Thank you so much.

33:51.420 --> 33:52.682
Hey, listen,
I have to run,

33:52.726 --> 33:54.336
I'm meeting
Nicole for lunch,

33:54.380 --> 33:55.511
but keep doing
what you're doing,

33:55.555 --> 33:56.556
it looks really good.

33:56.599 --> 33:58.210
Thank you.

34:00.516 --> 34:03.345
Okay, I'm practically
busting at the seams.

34:03.389 --> 34:05.173
I've kept something
from you,

34:05.217 --> 34:07.523
and I don't like
doing that.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.090
I feel like you and I

34:09.134 --> 34:12.092
should be 100% honest
with one another.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.355
Agreed?

34:13.399 --> 34:14.661
Yeah, agreed.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.661
Look, there's something
that I...

34:15.705 --> 34:16.750
You don't have
to be nervous.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.143
It hasn't been
announced yet,

34:19.187 --> 34:21.536
and you have
to be sworn to secrecy.

34:21.581 --> 34:22.712
Okay.

34:22.755 --> 34:23.713
Cross your heart.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.759
Yeah,
cross my heart.

34:25.802 --> 34:26.803
Okay.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.545
The winner of
the C.M.B.C.A.C...

34:29.589 --> 34:30.981
I'm sorry?

34:31.025 --> 34:34.159
Chocolate Monthly Best Chocolate
in America Contest.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.248
We call it C.M.B.C.A.C.
for short.

34:36.291 --> 34:37.248
Okay!

34:37.292 --> 34:38.293
Brace yourself.

34:39.293 --> 34:40.252
The winner...

34:41.427 --> 34:42.732
will have a storefront...

34:42.775 --> 34:43.733
in Times Square.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.213
You're joking?

34:45.257 --> 34:46.214
No.

34:46.257 --> 34:47.389
But that's...

34:47.433 --> 34:48.650
Your dream.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.130
I know.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.132
You in New York City.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.351
Anything is possible.

34:52.393 --> 34:54.309
Your life is about
to change, young lady.

34:54.353 --> 34:55.353
It is?

34:55.397 --> 34:57.138
I mean,
I can't choose favorites,

34:57.182 --> 34:58.792
but if your new flavor

34:58.835 --> 35:01.316
lives up to everything
you've done...

35:01.360 --> 35:03.318
I'm just saying.

35:03.362 --> 35:05.233
Wow.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.234
Your ship
has sailed in,

35:06.278 --> 35:07.540
and it's made of chocolate.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.760
Yeah, wow again.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.675
Change...

35:16.201 --> 35:17.811
[Hannah]: Okay, we need
to send out invites,

35:17.854 --> 35:20.248
so we need addresses and numbers
of James' family and friends.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.771
Oh, he has all that.

35:21.815 --> 35:23.295
Okay. Check.

35:24.296 --> 35:25.297
Flowers.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.341
Roses?

35:26.385 --> 35:28.343
James doesn't like roses.

35:28.387 --> 35:29.344
Peony.

35:29.388 --> 35:30.737
Peony...
color?

35:30.780 --> 35:31.781
Light pink.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.653
Okay, pink,
check.

35:33.696 --> 35:36.438
Maid of Honor,
moi.

35:36.482 --> 35:38.440
Church...
working on that.

35:38.484 --> 35:39.354
Dress?

35:41.182 --> 35:43.271
I emailed Mrs. Goodmanson.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.621
I am reordering the same dress
from the second attempt.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.797
She said it should be ready
by the wedding.

35:47.841 --> 35:49.190
Good, check.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.192
[doorbell ringing]

36:00.332 --> 36:01.333
Surprise!

36:02.334 --> 36:03.378
Quite.

36:03.422 --> 36:04.814
Okay, I know
I should have called,

36:04.858 --> 36:07.165
but I sometimes get these
spontaneous thoughts,

36:07.208 --> 36:08.296
and I just...
I can't help myself.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.255
Let's hang!

36:10.298 --> 36:12.170
Okay, yeah, let's.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.346
Uh...

36:20.352 --> 36:21.657
Ms. Sweeney! Hi!

36:21.701 --> 36:24.269
Oh, I didn't realize
you had company.

36:24.312 --> 36:25.487
Oh, it's all right.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.228
We're just hanging.

36:27.272 --> 36:29.187
What is that?

36:29.230 --> 36:31.450
What is what?

36:31.493 --> 36:32.668
Oh...
Pictionary.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.757
We were playing
a game of Pictionary.

36:34.801 --> 36:37.325
Oh, I love games!

36:37.369 --> 36:38.718
Let's play games.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.937
-Yes, let's.
-Yeah!

36:40.981 --> 36:43.549
I'm so tired of work.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.725
Let's not discuss any business,
agreed?

36:45.768 --> 36:47.466
Agreed.

36:47.509 --> 36:48.815
Okay, I'm going
to go heat this up.

36:48.858 --> 36:50.208
I'm going to go
pop it in the oven.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.209
Oh, you know what?
I got it.

36:51.252 --> 36:52.732
It's okay...
make yourself at home.

37:00.479 --> 37:01.610
So what was it?

37:01.654 --> 37:03.612
Uh...
what was what?

37:03.656 --> 37:05.266
What were you drawing?

37:05.310 --> 37:06.528
Oh... that's the problem.

37:06.572 --> 37:07.747
I'm such a terrible drawer.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.358
I can't even remember
anymore.

37:10.402 --> 37:11.533
Oh, come on,
that's half the fun.

37:11.577 --> 37:12.447
Let me see.

37:12.491 --> 37:14.232
[Hannah]:
No, I...

37:14.275 --> 37:15.711
I'm terribly embarrassed.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.365
[Charlotte]:
Uh, you know what?

37:17.409 --> 37:19.237
I was thinking,

37:19.280 --> 37:20.368
why don't we
just go out?

37:20.412 --> 37:21.674
I brought food.

37:21.717 --> 37:22.675
I'm just so...

37:22.718 --> 37:24.894
stir crazy.

37:24.938 --> 37:25.939
That was the word!

37:25.982 --> 37:27.288
It was stir...

37:27.332 --> 37:29.551
crazy.

37:29.595 --> 37:31.510
That's charades.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.948
We're flexible.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.732
[Charlotte]: So flexible
that we thought,

37:36.776 --> 37:39.300
let's just get out of here,
you know.

37:39.344 --> 37:41.955
Let's just go out,
have some fun.

37:43.565 --> 37:44.871
What's going on?

37:44.914 --> 37:46.568
Nothing.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.537
I am very confused.

37:58.580 --> 38:02.280
That's because
it's very confusing.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.759
Do tell.

38:03.803 --> 38:04.847
All right.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.806
Uh...

38:06.849 --> 38:09.504
well...

38:09.548 --> 38:11.376
turns out

38:11.419 --> 38:13.508
I'm the terrible,
manipulative woman

38:13.552 --> 38:15.075
who broke James' heart.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.426
You?

38:18.470 --> 38:19.427
You said
there was nothing...

38:19.471 --> 38:20.428
That's 'cause
we broke up...

38:20.472 --> 38:21.429
sort of.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.649
I...
I kind of...

38:23.692 --> 38:25.607
called off the wedding
a few days ago.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.783
Didn't you already do that
once before?

38:28.871 --> 38:30.308
Yes,
and listen, I'm just...

38:30.351 --> 38:31.744
I'm trying to
prove to James

38:31.787 --> 38:33.615
that it was
a huge mistake.

38:33.659 --> 38:35.443
He planned
all of the weddings before,

38:35.487 --> 38:38.794
so now I'm planning
the next one.

38:38.838 --> 38:41.319
That's what we were doing.

38:43.538 --> 38:45.845
Well, I don't understand
why you wouldn't just tell me.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.543
Uh...
well, I tried,

38:48.587 --> 38:50.458
but we got distracted,
and I just...

38:50.502 --> 38:52.808
I didn't really know
how to word it...

38:52.852 --> 38:53.809
because you have

38:53.853 --> 38:54.854
a history with James,

38:54.897 --> 38:56.508
and you care about him...

38:56.551 --> 38:57.596
and suddenly,

38:57.639 --> 39:00.381
I was the Wicked Witch
of the West.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.426
And you thought
it was going

39:01.469 --> 39:03.819
to get
in the way of the contest.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.778
[laughing]

39:05.821 --> 39:07.606
I mean, what kind of girl
do you think I am?

39:08.868 --> 39:10.478
An ex-girlfriend?

39:10.522 --> 39:13.351
I don't blame you.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.439
I would have done
the same thing.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.745
I'm really sorry
I mislead you,

39:16.789 --> 39:19.574
and I really hope
that we can still have

39:19.618 --> 39:21.750
an open, honest
relationship...

39:21.794 --> 39:23.404
if there is still
a relationship.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.971
With James?

39:25.014 --> 39:27.016
No... us?

39:27.060 --> 39:28.888
Do you love him?

39:28.931 --> 39:32.500
Oh, yes,
very, very much.

39:32.544 --> 39:34.154
Well, then I won't interfere.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.636
You're not upset?

39:37.679 --> 39:38.941
No.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.031
As long as
you promise me...

39:42.075 --> 39:43.816
you're not going
to break his heart again.

39:43.859 --> 39:45.513
Yeah, never.

39:45.557 --> 39:47.123
Thank you so much.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.473
So...

39:48.516 --> 39:51.040
when's the big day?

39:51.084 --> 39:54.087
Uh, 25, 24-ish days.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.697
And he's aware?

39:55.741 --> 39:56.611
More or less.

39:56.655 --> 39:57.525
Which one?

39:57.569 --> 39:59.440
It's complicated.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.051
Well, I'm so happy for you.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.140
You have quite the month,

40:04.184 --> 40:07.448
with the contest
and expanding business,

40:07.492 --> 40:09.058
and now you're getting married.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.060
Lucky girl.

40:11.104 --> 40:13.149
The food's on me.

40:13.193 --> 40:15.500
I'm going
to leave you two at it.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.589
I really wish you and James
the best...

40:17.632 --> 40:20.592
I won't get
in the way.

40:23.116 --> 40:25.901
Uh, thanks again, and...

40:25.945 --> 40:26.946
have a good night.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.558
Do you believe a word
of what she just said?

40:30.602 --> 40:31.603
Not a one.

40:34.823 --> 40:37.696
Why wouldn't you
just tell me?

40:37.739 --> 40:39.915
I was worried
it might interfere

40:39.959 --> 40:40.786
with you
and Charlotte.

40:40.829 --> 40:42.570
That's what Charlotte said.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.180
That's nonsense.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.486
I told her the same thing.

40:45.530 --> 40:46.444
I'm happy for you.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.490
The two of you together are...

40:49.534 --> 40:51.100
#cute.

40:51.144 --> 40:55.931
Hashtag something anyway.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.977
Look, I know
I came on pretty strong,

40:58.020 --> 41:01.023
but I couldn't help myself.

41:01.067 --> 41:03.504
I mean,
you're a pretty great catch.

41:03.548 --> 41:05.724
Am I?

41:06.812 --> 41:08.770
I can't imagine a girl
letting you out of her sight

41:08.814 --> 41:09.858
for a moment.

41:11.033 --> 41:13.688
You are far more
forgiving than me.

41:13.732 --> 41:16.125
The girl has a track record,

41:16.169 --> 41:18.824
and in this case,
literally a track record.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.129
She actually ran.

41:20.173 --> 41:21.479
Yeah, I know,
I was there.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.742
Thank you, though.

41:23.785 --> 41:25.091
What makes it so different
this time?

41:25.134 --> 41:26.266
What's changed?

41:28.007 --> 41:29.835
I'm kind of waiting
to find out.

41:31.053 --> 41:32.054
[Nicole]: Okay, sure,

41:32.098 --> 41:35.144
it's a sweet gesture
on her part,

41:35.188 --> 41:37.495
but I would hate
to see you get hurt...

41:37.538 --> 41:39.671
again.

41:39.714 --> 41:40.933
Seems to me
she's only doing this

41:40.976 --> 41:43.979
because you've said no for real
this time...

41:44.023 --> 41:47.505
and they say people want
what they can't have.

41:47.548 --> 41:48.767
Once she has you...

41:48.810 --> 41:51.639
poof, she's gone!

41:51.683 --> 41:52.640
I'm just saying this

41:52.684 --> 41:54.512
as your friend, of course.

41:54.555 --> 41:55.817
Of course.

41:55.861 --> 41:56.862
Oh!

41:56.905 --> 41:59.604
[clattering]
I'm so sorry!

41:59.647 --> 42:00.648
[fake British accent]
Go about your business.

42:00.692 --> 42:02.041
Nothing to see here.

42:05.261 --> 42:06.915
[Nicole]: You just need
to look out for yourself.

42:06.959 --> 42:08.526
You're so forgiving.

42:08.569 --> 42:09.831
Yeah, would you give me one sec?

42:09.875 --> 42:11.311
I just...
one second.

42:14.619 --> 42:15.837
[clearing throat]

42:15.881 --> 42:16.925
[fake British accent]
Oh, excuse me, sir.

42:16.969 --> 42:18.057
I'm really sorry,
I'm late for work.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.232
Oh, do I know you?

42:19.275 --> 42:20.581
No, definitely not.

42:20.625 --> 42:22.931
You're that chocolate lady,
aren't you?

42:24.237 --> 42:25.543
Are you serious?

42:25.586 --> 42:27.022
What is all this?

42:27.066 --> 42:28.676
[normal voice]:
I... mm...

42:31.331 --> 42:32.680
Look, she just...

42:32.724 --> 42:34.552
come on, look
at her, right?

42:34.595 --> 42:37.076
She's charming,
and she's trying to charm you.

42:37.119 --> 42:38.643
No, we were
just catching up.

42:38.686 --> 42:39.905
Oh, yeah, I bet.

42:39.948 --> 42:41.254
Look, she knows
about us.

42:42.342 --> 42:43.648
I know, she told me.

42:43.691 --> 42:45.301
She knows about me...

42:45.345 --> 42:46.694
my track record.

42:46.738 --> 42:49.001
That, too, yep.

42:49.044 --> 42:50.611
Well, and she
wants you.

42:50.655 --> 42:53.092
That doesn't mean
I want her.

42:53.135 --> 42:55.137
Well, maybe
not now,

42:55.181 --> 42:56.704
but wait until
she's like...

42:56.748 --> 43:00.012
"Well, I would have never
left you at the altar,

43:00.055 --> 43:01.709
and I would never
let you go,

43:01.753 --> 43:03.145
and you're the one for me,
James."

43:03.189 --> 43:04.582
I mean, she's not going
to say it exactly like that,

43:04.625 --> 43:05.887
but she's going to...

43:05.931 --> 43:07.672
Just say what,
that she's happy for me,

43:07.715 --> 43:08.847
and that you're
a great girl,

43:08.890 --> 43:11.023
and that the two of us
look cute together?

43:11.066 --> 43:12.894
She said that?

43:12.938 --> 43:14.896
You're paranoid.

43:14.940 --> 43:18.291
No, just, just...
embarrassed.

43:18.334 --> 43:19.901
How are the wedding plans
going?

43:19.945 --> 43:20.859
Don't mock me.

43:20.902 --> 43:22.817
I'm not.

43:22.861 --> 43:23.992
Well...

43:24.036 --> 43:25.733
for your information,

43:25.777 --> 43:28.083
they are going
very well, okay?

43:28.127 --> 43:29.911
I am going to give you
the wedding of your dreams.

43:29.955 --> 43:30.782
Oh, really?

43:30.825 --> 43:32.087
Mm-hmm.

43:32.131 --> 43:33.741
What's your escape route
going to be this time?

43:33.785 --> 43:35.177
Not funny.

43:35.221 --> 43:36.178
I'm serious.

43:36.222 --> 43:38.180
I know, train, right?

43:38.224 --> 43:40.661
It's going to take place
at the train station.

43:40.705 --> 43:42.837
You are so funny
that I forgot to laugh.

43:42.881 --> 43:44.012
Mm.

43:44.056 --> 43:46.841
You want to come in
and have some coffee?

43:46.885 --> 43:47.842
What, with her?

43:47.886 --> 43:49.801
Come on,
are you kidding?

44:07.166 --> 44:10.299
1966 Beaumont
Convertible.

44:10.343 --> 44:11.344
Yeah...

44:13.172 --> 44:14.695
[Oscar]: Do you think
that's your grandfather's car?

44:14.739 --> 44:15.696
Black...

44:15.740 --> 44:18.743
white interior.

44:18.786 --> 44:20.222
VIN number?

44:20.266 --> 44:21.789
-Hang on.
-Uh-huh.

44:32.713 --> 44:34.802
7311.

44:36.282 --> 44:37.805
This is it...
this is it!

44:37.849 --> 44:38.850
[laughing]

44:38.893 --> 44:40.765
Going up for auction
in 10 days.

44:40.808 --> 44:42.114
I can't believe it!

44:42.157 --> 44:44.159
When did this come out?

44:44.203 --> 44:45.334
This morning.

44:45.378 --> 44:46.814
I thought it looked
like the same one.

44:46.858 --> 44:48.163
You don't get
that color combo

44:48.207 --> 44:49.164
very often,

44:49.208 --> 44:50.339
so I came over.

44:50.383 --> 44:51.993
This is incredible.

44:52.037 --> 44:54.953
I've been looking for this
for five years.

44:54.996 --> 44:55.954
I...

44:55.997 --> 44:58.391
I mean,
what are the chances?

44:58.434 --> 45:00.393
Thank you, Oscar,
thank you!

45:01.960 --> 45:03.744
Oh, ho, ho.

45:03.788 --> 45:04.789
Wow.

45:11.012 --> 45:12.231
Man, I sure wish
my grandfather

45:12.274 --> 45:13.406
could see it.

45:13.449 --> 45:15.843
Well, it's something
you can pass down

45:15.887 --> 45:16.888
to your grandchildren.

45:18.237 --> 45:19.194
Yeah.

45:20.892 --> 45:22.110
That's starting to look
less and less likely

45:22.154 --> 45:23.242
these days.

45:23.285 --> 45:24.809
She's trying,
you know.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.419
Hasn't really been herself.

45:26.462 --> 45:28.769
Yeah.

45:28.813 --> 45:30.728
Sometimes,
I hardly recognize her.

45:30.771 --> 45:32.730
Look, I know
she's let you down,

45:32.773 --> 45:34.209
but I'm really hoping

45:34.253 --> 45:36.342
you can give her
another chance.

45:36.385 --> 45:38.344
A third.

45:38.387 --> 45:39.780
She really does mean it.

45:39.824 --> 45:42.435
Truth is, Oscar...

45:42.478 --> 45:45.830
I don't think I could ever
actually say no to her...

45:45.873 --> 45:46.918
Yeah.

45:46.961 --> 45:48.354
But I have to admit,

45:48.397 --> 45:50.356
it's kind of nice seeing her
work for it, you know?

45:50.399 --> 45:51.444
Why not let her sweat it out
a bit?

45:51.487 --> 45:52.445
Oh...

45:52.488 --> 45:54.403
yeah, she's sweating.

45:54.447 --> 45:56.014
Good.

45:56.057 --> 45:57.189
Good luck
with that car.

45:57.232 --> 45:58.277
Thank you!

45:58.320 --> 45:59.234
Thank you.

45:59.278 --> 46:00.453
Hey!

46:01.541 --> 46:03.064
I'll take you
for the first spin.

46:03.108 --> 46:05.110
And I'll look forward to it.

46:12.813 --> 46:16.208
So I heard that
the wedding is back on.

46:16.251 --> 46:17.949
That's the plan.

46:17.992 --> 46:21.343
Well, third
time's a charm.

46:22.431 --> 46:26.435
You know, it really is meant
to be a sacred institution,

46:26.479 --> 46:28.786
not to be entered into
lightly.

46:28.829 --> 46:30.962
I guess
that's why it wasn't.

46:31.005 --> 46:34.095
Well, not too many people
trust their feelings

46:34.139 --> 46:35.793
up to the last minute...

46:35.836 --> 46:38.883
or last second,
in your case.

46:40.188 --> 46:42.277
I thought
I was being a coward.

46:42.321 --> 46:43.365
No.

46:43.409 --> 46:46.804
Cowardice would be
getting married

46:46.847 --> 46:48.109
when you weren't
ready to embrace

46:48.153 --> 46:51.286
what it really means
to be husband and wife.

46:51.330 --> 46:52.548
I'll take it...

46:53.985 --> 46:55.377
but listen,

46:55.421 --> 46:58.380
it's very important
that it happens at the church.

46:58.424 --> 46:59.729
It's James' church,

46:59.773 --> 47:01.470
and he really wants
to have the wedding here.

47:01.514 --> 47:03.864
Well, there is
a luncheon scheduled

47:03.908 --> 47:06.301
for the day
that you requested.

47:06.345 --> 47:10.349
I could have it moved
if you're certain.

47:10.392 --> 47:11.393
Yes.

47:11.437 --> 47:13.482
Absolutely certain.

47:13.526 --> 47:14.527
Oh, my gosh,
thank you.

47:14.570 --> 47:16.181
Thank you so much.

47:16.224 --> 47:18.226
It's really going
to mean the world to him.

47:18.270 --> 47:19.314
And you.

47:19.358 --> 47:20.315
And me.

47:20.359 --> 47:21.316
Right.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.927
Yes.

47:22.970 --> 47:24.580
But remember,
Charlotte,

47:24.624 --> 47:25.843
commitment starts

47:25.886 --> 47:29.194
with getting through
the entire ceremony...

47:29.237 --> 47:32.850
and God will be
watching,

47:32.893 --> 47:35.026
and judging...

47:35.069 --> 47:36.897
again.

47:39.204 --> 47:41.423
Roseanne's Wedding Cakes...

47:41.467 --> 47:43.643
should be right about...

47:50.955 --> 47:51.912
[Nicole]:
Charlotte!

47:51.956 --> 47:53.435
Oh, hi.

47:53.479 --> 47:55.089
Hi.

47:55.133 --> 47:56.090
What are you doing?

47:56.134 --> 47:58.179
Uh, just...
shopping, and....

47:58.223 --> 47:59.180
you too?

47:59.224 --> 48:00.573
Oh, it's just
a little something

48:00.616 --> 48:01.617
I picked up
for James.

48:03.054 --> 48:04.577
I just want to help him
spruce up a little.

48:04.620 --> 48:07.101
Think of it
as a favor to you.

48:07.145 --> 48:08.973
I like the way he's spruced.

48:09.016 --> 48:12.019
Most men just don't get
their full potential.

48:12.063 --> 48:13.412
Have you ever seen him dressed

48:13.455 --> 48:15.893
in anything other
than a pair of jeans and boots?

48:15.936 --> 48:17.372
Uh... no.

48:17.416 --> 48:19.374
There you go...

48:19.418 --> 48:20.549
and you, my friend,

48:20.593 --> 48:23.030
might be
on the cover of my magazine.

48:23.074 --> 48:24.249
I'll take you shopping, too.

48:26.425 --> 48:28.209
So, your big moment's
coming up.

48:28.253 --> 48:30.124
The tasting, I mean,
not your wedding.

48:30.168 --> 48:32.257
How's your new creation
coming along?

48:32.300 --> 48:34.433
Just... great.

48:34.476 --> 48:36.000
Great!

48:36.043 --> 48:37.392
Well, I should get going.

48:37.436 --> 48:39.003
Ta-ta!

48:39.046 --> 48:40.265
Oh.

48:44.225 --> 48:47.402
Now she's dressing him.
Says she wants to spruce him up.

48:47.446 --> 48:48.882
Oh, and here's the kicker--

48:48.926 --> 48:50.666
she says she's doing it for me
as some sort of favor.

48:50.710 --> 48:52.494
Sure that's not
too much vanilla?

48:52.538 --> 48:54.409
Then she said she's going
to take me shopping.

48:54.453 --> 48:56.411
I mean, come on,
do I need sprucing?

48:56.455 --> 48:58.413
You're fully spruced.

49:01.503 --> 49:02.940
[Nicole clearing throat]

49:02.983 --> 49:04.202
Hi. It's me.

49:04.245 --> 49:05.638
Hi.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.207
I got you a little something.

49:09.250 --> 49:10.208
For me?

49:10.251 --> 49:12.297
Yes, for you.

49:12.340 --> 49:13.341
Okay...

49:13.385 --> 49:14.299
uh...

49:16.301 --> 49:17.737
let's see what we got.

49:19.086 --> 49:20.609
Clothes.

49:22.133 --> 49:23.090
You like?

49:23.134 --> 49:24.657
They're, uh...

49:24.700 --> 49:26.354
They're nice.

49:26.398 --> 49:29.444
They're... classy.

49:29.488 --> 49:31.316
Well, I think
you deserve classy.

49:33.318 --> 49:34.362
Why did you buy me
clothes?

49:34.406 --> 49:35.494
I was out,
and I saw them,

49:35.537 --> 49:37.496
and I figured
I would surprise you.

49:38.497 --> 49:39.977
Maybe we can have
that dinner...

49:40.020 --> 49:41.369
a dress-up dinner.

49:41.413 --> 49:42.588
We've hardly had
a chance to catch up.

49:44.503 --> 49:45.678
Not tonight.

49:45.721 --> 49:47.288
Well, what about tomorrow?

49:47.332 --> 49:48.507
Well,
let's talk tomorrow...

49:48.550 --> 49:50.248
but thank you
very much.

49:50.291 --> 49:52.032
I haven't bought myself
new clothes

49:52.076 --> 49:52.990
in a long time.

49:53.033 --> 49:54.687
You're very welcome.

49:56.210 --> 49:58.386
Do you have time
to have a quick tea?

50:02.347 --> 50:03.522
Yeah, sure.

50:03.565 --> 50:05.176
Uh, quick tea.

50:05.219 --> 50:06.220
One quick tea.

50:06.264 --> 50:08.135
Let me run these
upstairs,

50:08.179 --> 50:10.703
and I will be
right back.

50:43.605 --> 50:44.824
Hmm...

50:54.399 --> 50:57.097
"Chocolate connoisseur!"

50:57.141 --> 50:58.316
"The sommelier
of confectionary!"

50:58.359 --> 50:59.447
I mean,
who does she think she is,

50:59.491 --> 51:01.710
and why is she
judging me?

51:01.754 --> 51:04.061
Try and keep your eye
on the prize, all right?

51:04.104 --> 51:06.628
The pen really is mightier
than the sword,

51:06.672 --> 51:08.717
so wait until after
the tasting's over,

51:08.761 --> 51:10.284
after she loves
your new flavor

51:10.328 --> 51:11.677
and names you
the winner,

51:11.720 --> 51:13.374
then let her know
what you really think.

51:13.418 --> 51:14.593
You know what?

51:14.636 --> 51:16.203
I bet she's going
to try and take him out

51:16.247 --> 51:18.292
to the most expensive dinner
that she can possibly afford,

51:18.336 --> 51:20.512
and then she's going
to impress him

51:20.555 --> 51:22.514
with all
of her world travel

51:22.557 --> 51:24.211
and celebrity hob-nobbing,

51:24.255 --> 51:26.605
flatter him with all the things
that they have in common.

51:27.649 --> 51:29.260
That won't impress James.

51:29.303 --> 51:32.132
Yeah, well, most men don't know
their full potential.

51:32.176 --> 51:33.438
Listen,
just go see him

51:33.481 --> 51:34.569
and tell him why
you're the one.

51:34.613 --> 51:36.223
No, I have.

51:36.267 --> 51:37.790
Then tell him again.

51:37.833 --> 51:39.096
He needs to
keep hearing it

51:39.139 --> 51:40.488
until he knows
your full potential.

51:40.532 --> 51:42.099
Yeah,
but what am I supposed to say?

51:42.142 --> 51:43.100
I mean,
I've already said

51:43.143 --> 51:44.101
my car is making
every single noise

51:44.144 --> 51:45.537
in the whole wide world.

51:45.580 --> 51:47.321
We still need
his guest list.

51:47.365 --> 51:49.106
That's a valid reason.

51:49.149 --> 51:50.150
Guest list...

51:50.194 --> 51:51.282
Mm-hmm.

51:53.501 --> 51:55.590
She really is,
like, an artist.

51:55.634 --> 51:56.678
I mean...

51:56.722 --> 51:58.115
you should put that
in your magazine.

51:58.158 --> 51:59.116
Well, she hasn't won
the competition yet.

52:00.856 --> 52:02.510
Wait until you try
her chocolate.

52:02.554 --> 52:04.164
You don't even
like chocolate.

52:04.208 --> 52:06.166
Then just ask
anyone.

52:06.210 --> 52:07.341
They come
from all over.

52:07.385 --> 52:10.170
How are you not furious
at her?

52:10.214 --> 52:12.172
She left you
at the altar.

52:12.216 --> 52:13.347
Most girls
don't get the chance

52:13.391 --> 52:14.435
to say I do,

52:14.479 --> 52:16.220
much less I don't.

52:17.351 --> 52:18.526
It wasn't like that.

52:20.441 --> 52:21.442
James?

52:28.580 --> 52:30.451
[James]:
What about you?

52:30.495 --> 52:31.931
I would have thought
you would have gotten married.

52:33.237 --> 52:34.325
Oh, no.

52:34.368 --> 52:37.415
I never met the right man
after you.

52:39.417 --> 52:41.636
I wasn't the right guy.

52:41.680 --> 52:43.160
I think you were...

52:43.203 --> 52:44.335
you just weren't
Mr. Right Now.

52:44.378 --> 52:45.336
Mm.

52:45.379 --> 52:47.381
Story of my life.

52:47.425 --> 52:49.340
I wasn't ready.

52:49.383 --> 52:51.211
Story of my life.

52:51.255 --> 52:53.170
I think about it, though.

52:53.213 --> 52:55.172
Think about what?

52:55.215 --> 52:57.478
My wedding that never was,
my dream wedding.

52:57.522 --> 53:00.786
I mean,
what girl doesn't?

53:00.829 --> 53:02.440
I'm sorry,

53:02.483 --> 53:03.484
it's probably not a good subject
with what you've been through.

53:03.528 --> 53:05.312
No, no.

53:05.356 --> 53:07.314
No, it's fine.

53:07.358 --> 53:09.664
I want to hear about it,
please.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.840
You're going to think
I'm silly.

53:11.884 --> 53:14.234
Try me.

53:14.278 --> 53:16.671
All right.

53:16.715 --> 53:17.890
I want to serve...

53:17.933 --> 53:21.894
popcorn and funnel cakes
at the reception.

53:23.678 --> 53:24.592
Are you serious?

53:24.636 --> 53:25.724
I just told you.

53:25.767 --> 53:26.768
No, that's just...

53:28.727 --> 53:30.337
it's ironic...

53:30.381 --> 53:31.338
because that's my plan.

53:31.382 --> 53:32.731
Come on!

53:32.774 --> 53:34.341
Yeah.

53:34.385 --> 53:35.951
I mean, who would have thought?

53:35.995 --> 53:37.475
[Nicole]: Well, I want there
to be traditional wedding things

53:37.518 --> 53:38.606
as well.

53:38.650 --> 53:39.781
Flowers...

53:39.825 --> 53:42.306
but I don't like roses.

53:42.349 --> 53:44.569
Peonies.

53:44.612 --> 53:45.613
Come on.

53:47.485 --> 53:48.442
What color?

53:48.486 --> 53:49.791
[Nicole]:
Light-pink.

53:49.835 --> 53:51.402
[James]:
Yeah, that's...

53:52.751 --> 53:53.665
weird.

53:53.708 --> 53:56.233
Oh, I have a whole list.

54:12.901 --> 54:15.382
I mean, how is it
even possible?

54:15.426 --> 54:17.297
She wants carnival food
at her wedding, too,

54:17.341 --> 54:19.517
and light-pink peony
is her favorite flower?

54:19.560 --> 54:20.996
Just a coincidence?

54:21.040 --> 54:22.781
Yeah, but what if it isn't?

54:22.824 --> 54:23.912
What if they're meant to be?

54:23.956 --> 54:25.262
Don't say that.

54:25.305 --> 54:27.481
You should have
heard them, Hannah.

54:28.526 --> 54:30.310
Okay.

54:30.354 --> 54:31.833
Moment of truth.

54:31.877 --> 54:33.922
All right.

54:40.451 --> 54:41.408
Wow.

54:41.452 --> 54:42.409
Yeah?

54:42.453 --> 54:43.410
Yeah, unreal.

54:43.454 --> 54:45.412
I love
the hint of strawberry.

54:45.456 --> 54:47.371
What?
No, no hint.

54:47.414 --> 54:48.937
Yeah, definitely a hint.

54:48.981 --> 54:50.635
Oh, my gosh,
I must've mixed it in.

54:50.678 --> 54:51.766
I got distracted!

54:51.810 --> 54:53.681
I can't...
she's allergic.

54:53.725 --> 54:55.770
She got under your skin.
It happens.

54:55.814 --> 54:56.858
Yeah, well, that's exactly
what's going to happen

54:56.902 --> 54:57.903
if she eats that batch.

54:57.946 --> 54:59.078
It's going
to get under her skin.

54:59.121 --> 55:00.993
Her throat's going
to get all prickly.

55:01.036 --> 55:03.909
I'm just going to have to create
a whole other batch.

55:03.952 --> 55:07.304
Everything is going wrong.

55:11.395 --> 55:12.961
I don't know, Hannah...
I give up.

55:13.005 --> 55:13.962
No.

55:14.006 --> 55:15.834
Just a few hiccups.

55:15.877 --> 55:16.704
You make a new batch.

55:16.748 --> 55:17.923
In the meantime,

55:17.966 --> 55:19.054
we have
a wedding to plan,

55:19.098 --> 55:20.708
and you're not giving up
on that either.

55:20.752 --> 55:22.319
-But...
-No buts.

55:22.362 --> 55:24.973
The last thing on our checklist
is the invites, right?

55:25.017 --> 55:27.672
Which I didn't even get
from him last night.

55:27.715 --> 55:28.803
Okay.

55:28.847 --> 55:30.022
You go concentrate
on the chocolate.

55:30.065 --> 55:31.763
I'll go to get the list.

55:32.894 --> 55:33.939
Hey...

55:33.982 --> 55:35.027
we're a team, right?

55:36.028 --> 55:37.638
Yep.

55:37.682 --> 55:39.510
We got this.

55:40.989 --> 55:41.947
[Hannah]:
Hello?

55:41.990 --> 55:42.948
James?

55:42.991 --> 55:43.992
Whoa.

55:45.777 --> 55:46.821
Do I look stupid?

55:46.865 --> 55:48.388
You look amazing.

55:49.694 --> 55:51.739
I feel... constrained.

55:51.783 --> 55:53.654
I wouldn't
change a thing.

55:53.698 --> 55:55.090
What's the occasion?

55:55.134 --> 55:56.657
Uh...
I have an appointment.

55:57.702 --> 55:58.659
An appointment?

55:58.703 --> 55:59.834
Mm-hmm.

55:59.878 --> 56:01.140
Honey,

56:01.183 --> 56:02.707
an appointment
is when you go to the doctor.

56:02.750 --> 56:04.099
You're dressed to impress.

56:04.143 --> 56:05.840
Well, that too,
and I'm late.

56:05.884 --> 56:07.320
What's up?

56:07.364 --> 56:09.627
Charlotte asked if I could get
the guest list from you.

56:09.670 --> 56:10.932
The guest list?

56:10.976 --> 56:12.847
We're sending out
the invites.

56:12.891 --> 56:15.676
I told her nobody's going
to fall for that again.

56:17.069 --> 56:18.418
The wedding's on.

56:18.462 --> 56:20.072
They'll be there,
and so will she.

56:21.421 --> 56:22.422
Okay.

56:22.466 --> 56:24.076
Well, look,
it's in here somewhere.

56:24.119 --> 56:25.077
I'm really late.
I've got to run.

56:25.120 --> 56:26.078
Feel free
to have a look.

56:26.121 --> 56:28.646
For your "appointment."

56:30.430 --> 56:31.692
Yeah.

56:31.736 --> 56:32.998
What?

56:33.999 --> 56:35.130
Nothing.

56:36.567 --> 56:37.785
Nothing!

56:50.450 --> 56:52.713
Light-pink peonies?

56:52.757 --> 56:53.888
A list?

56:53.932 --> 56:54.889
Everything you overheard

56:54.933 --> 56:56.717
Nicole say she liked.

56:56.761 --> 56:59.416
She obviously saw this
before she told him any of that.

56:59.459 --> 57:01.156
So she was playing him.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.462
Yeah,

57:02.506 --> 57:03.985
and she still is.

57:04.029 --> 57:05.596
He looks all dressed up,

57:05.639 --> 57:07.728
on his way to an "appointment."

57:07.772 --> 57:09.513
An appointment?

57:09.556 --> 57:10.470
I bet.

57:10.514 --> 57:11.732
Exactly.

57:11.776 --> 57:14.126
You better figure out
a way to stall him.

57:14.169 --> 57:16.955
He's dressed to kill,
trust me.

57:16.998 --> 57:19.653
Well, where is
this so-called appointment?

57:19.697 --> 57:20.959
I didn't ask.

57:21.002 --> 57:22.134
Never mind.

57:22.177 --> 57:24.179
I have an idea.

57:25.877 --> 57:27.531
Yep.

57:30.925 --> 57:33.493
[phone ringing]

57:33.537 --> 57:34.973
Hello, Charlotte.

57:35.016 --> 57:36.191
Hey, James.

57:36.235 --> 57:38.759
Uh, listen,
I am so sorry to bother you,

57:38.803 --> 57:40.108
but I'm stuck
on the side of the road,

57:40.152 --> 57:41.849
and every service station
I called

57:41.893 --> 57:43.938
said they can't send anybody
for an hour.

57:43.982 --> 57:45.679
What's wrong?

57:45.723 --> 57:46.941
My car just... died.

57:46.985 --> 57:49.901
So... could you come
and take a look at it?

57:49.944 --> 57:53.470
I'm on my way somewhere,
and I'm already running late.

57:53.513 --> 57:54.732
You know me, I probably just
turned the wrong knob

57:54.775 --> 57:56.168
or something.

57:56.211 --> 57:57.778
Pretty please?

57:57.822 --> 57:58.997
Cherry on top?

58:01.216 --> 58:03.131
Where are you?

58:33.727 --> 58:34.728
Ooh...

58:34.772 --> 58:36.643
look at you,
looking all snazzy.

58:37.644 --> 58:38.602
Yeah, do you like it?

58:38.645 --> 58:40.038
Looks okay.

58:40.081 --> 58:41.866
It's growing on me.

58:41.909 --> 58:42.997
I bet it is.

58:43.041 --> 58:45.783
What did your car
do before it quit?

58:45.826 --> 58:47.045
I don't know,
it just sort of...

58:47.088 --> 58:48.220
stopped.

58:48.263 --> 58:50.265
Well, look,
your cap wires are loose.

58:50.309 --> 58:52.703
Not sure how they could have
just fallen off like that.

58:54.705 --> 58:55.836
Okay, there.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.883
Go ahead and try
and start it.

58:58.926 --> 58:59.884
What are you doing?

58:59.927 --> 59:01.712
Big hurry, huh?
I bet.

59:01.755 --> 59:04.018
Yeah, and I'm
already running late.

59:04.062 --> 59:05.759
What are you...?

59:05.803 --> 59:06.760
My keys are in there!

59:06.804 --> 59:07.979
Oh, are they?

59:08.022 --> 59:09.937
Sorry.

59:09.981 --> 59:11.330
What's wrong with you?

59:13.680 --> 59:14.681
What, yours is locked, too?

59:14.725 --> 59:16.596
I have to be there
in 15 minutes!

59:16.640 --> 59:17.684
Whoops.

59:19.033 --> 59:20.165
I'm never going
to make it in time now!

59:20.208 --> 59:22.602
Oh, yeah, and I bet
it's real important.

59:22.646 --> 59:23.603
Looking all snap.

59:23.647 --> 59:24.952
The new James Cooper.

59:24.996 --> 59:26.650
She's got you all
bundled up and packaged

59:26.693 --> 59:27.738
just the way
she likes it, huh?

59:27.781 --> 59:28.913
What are you talking about?

59:28.956 --> 59:30.131
Please.

59:30.175 --> 59:31.655
Don't worry,
she'll get over it.

59:31.698 --> 59:32.786
You think...

59:32.830 --> 59:34.266
you think
this is for her?

59:34.309 --> 59:36.224
Ah, yeah.

59:36.268 --> 59:37.748
Charlotte, I was
on my way to the auction,

59:37.791 --> 59:39.880
to bid on my grandfather's car.

59:39.924 --> 59:41.316
Say what?

59:41.360 --> 59:42.622
Oscar found it, the one
I've been looking for

59:42.666 --> 59:44.189
for the past five years?

59:44.232 --> 59:45.625
The one
he restored himself.

59:45.669 --> 59:47.235
The one
I've been waiting for

59:47.279 --> 59:49.150
to come back
onto the market.

59:49.194 --> 59:50.195
It did, okay,

59:50.238 --> 59:51.152
and the auction's today.

59:52.327 --> 59:53.328
Oh, crud.

59:55.679 --> 59:58.116
Is there still time?

59:58.159 --> 01:00:00.771
It was sold
10 minutes ago.

01:00:09.693 --> 01:00:10.824
All right.

01:00:10.868 --> 01:00:11.825
Who's the numbskull

01:00:11.869 --> 01:00:12.913
who locked the keys
in both cars?

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:22.227
Hello, Oscar.

01:00:24.098 --> 01:00:25.143
Good afternoon,
Ms. Sweeney.

01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:27.362
Is Charlotte here?

01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:29.103
She's out.
What can I do for you?

01:00:29.147 --> 01:00:31.149
Well, I'm just making sure
everything's on track

01:00:31.192 --> 01:00:32.629
for Saturday.

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:34.108
There's going
to be a lot of press,

01:00:34.152 --> 01:00:35.196
and, well,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.284
I just want to make sure

01:00:36.328 --> 01:00:37.764
she doesn't leave me
at the altar.

01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:39.331
Ah, yes.

01:00:41.333 --> 01:00:42.639
Ooh...

01:00:42.682 --> 01:00:43.770
is this it?

01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:45.685
No, she's still blending
the final mix.

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:47.644
It's not quite right yet.

01:00:47.687 --> 01:00:49.167
But it'll be ready
for Saturday?

01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:51.038
Oh, yes.

01:00:51.082 --> 01:00:52.736
And it's going to be terrific,
isn't it?

01:00:52.779 --> 01:00:54.215
If you're fair,

01:00:54.259 --> 01:00:56.043
it'll be the most amazing thing
you've ever consumed.

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.047
Well, this is
the new concept wrapping

01:01:00.091 --> 01:01:01.048
she showed me

01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:01.962
for her new chocolate.

01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:03.790
It is.

01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.705
I'm dying for a taste.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:07.707
Well, if you eat that one,
you'll wish you were.

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:08.882
Were what?

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:09.927
Dying.

01:01:11.189 --> 01:01:12.799
Why, what's wrong with it?

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:15.802
Charlotte mentioned you get
a reaction to strawberries.

01:01:15.846 --> 01:01:17.325
Oh.

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:18.718
Oh, yes.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.328
Thank you.

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:21.329
Well...

01:01:21.373 --> 01:01:22.679
let Charlotte know

01:01:22.722 --> 01:01:23.767
that I'm going to call her
with details.

01:01:23.810 --> 01:01:26.160
Of course.

01:01:26.204 --> 01:01:27.988
Why wouldn't I be fair?

01:01:28.032 --> 01:01:31.818
Because nothing's ever fair
in love and chocolate...

01:01:31.862 --> 01:01:33.733
is it?

01:01:35.387 --> 01:01:36.954
Thank you,
Oscar.

01:01:36.997 --> 01:01:37.998
You're welcome.

01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:41.175
[Hannah]:
That is bad.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:42.394
I don't think

01:01:42.437 --> 01:01:44.178
he's ever going to
speak to me again.

01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:45.963
I wouldn't
if I was him.

01:01:46.006 --> 01:01:47.181
Thank you.

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:48.705
It's my fault...
bad intel.

01:01:48.748 --> 01:01:50.010
No, look,
it's mine.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:52.360
I'm the one who's
acting stupid.

01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:53.579
It's just her.

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:55.059
I don't ever want
to see her face again.

01:01:55.102 --> 01:01:56.408
[phone ringing]

01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:57.844
[Hannah]:
Now, that's funny.

01:01:57.888 --> 01:02:00.151
Isn't it, though?

01:02:01.935 --> 01:02:03.067
Nicole!

01:02:03.110 --> 01:02:04.068
Charlotte!

01:02:04.111 --> 01:02:05.330
Nicole.

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:06.940
I want to apologize.

01:02:06.984 --> 01:02:08.376
For what?

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.813
Okay,

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:13.164
I admit I have been...
trying to win James over...

01:02:13.207 --> 01:02:15.166
but business is business.

01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:17.168
Oscar said your new flavor
will be ready for the tasting

01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.169
on Saturday.

01:02:18.212 --> 01:02:20.214
Yes, it's really close.

01:02:20.258 --> 01:02:21.259
I respect that.

01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:24.784
What do you say we shelve
our current competition

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:27.352
and focus on the one that matters most at the moment.

01:02:27.395 --> 01:02:28.745
For how long?

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:30.921
Until after the competition.

01:02:30.964 --> 01:02:31.965
Truce?

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.227
Truce.

01:02:33.271 --> 01:02:34.359
Agreed.

01:02:34.402 --> 01:02:36.274
Agreed.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:43.934
What?

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:46.110
A momentary
armistice.

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:47.851
How diplomatic.

01:02:47.894 --> 01:02:48.895
Right?

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:55.946
Good?

01:02:55.989 --> 01:02:57.512
It's the one.

01:02:58.992 --> 01:02:59.950
Mm...

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:02.126
Absolutely magical.

01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.304
Talk to me.

01:03:06.347 --> 01:03:08.001
Oh, it's nothing.

01:03:08.045 --> 01:03:09.046
It's just...

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:11.918
I made this for him, too.

01:03:11.962 --> 01:03:14.486
Thought maybe
he'd finally like chocolate.

01:03:29.153 --> 01:03:30.850
Engine trouble?

01:03:30.894 --> 01:03:32.896
Listen,
I know you're mad at me...

01:03:32.939 --> 01:03:34.462
but I'd really like you
to come tomorrow.

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:35.463
Never been a big fan
of chocolate.

01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:37.204
You know that.

01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.119
I think you'll like this one.

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:40.860
I made it for people
like you,

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.342
people I'm...
trying to win over.

01:03:44.385 --> 01:03:45.343
Hey, Charlotte.

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:46.300
Hey, Jimmy.

01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:48.128
No slacking off!

01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:49.129
Really?

01:03:49.173 --> 01:03:50.870
It honestly wasn't planned.

01:03:50.914 --> 01:03:53.090
I literally just
bumped into her.

01:03:53.133 --> 01:03:54.831
Yeah, right.

01:03:54.874 --> 01:03:56.310
That's a violation
of our terms!

01:03:56.354 --> 01:03:57.964
We never defined
our terms.

01:03:58.008 --> 01:03:59.270
Uh, what terms
are we...

01:03:59.313 --> 01:04:00.967
Nothing.

01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:02.839
Listen, just come tomorrow.

01:04:02.882 --> 01:04:04.188
Biggest day of my life,

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.667
and it won't mean anything
if you're not there.

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:08.496
You do know the irony
of what you just said, right?

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:10.498
Sorry.

01:04:10.542 --> 01:04:13.023
I'll think about it.

01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:24.295
It's a large crowd,

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:25.644
eagerly anticipating
the moment

01:04:25.687 --> 01:04:28.865
that Charlotte unveils
her new, secret flavor,

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:30.388
and none other
than Nicole Sweeney,

01:04:30.431 --> 01:04:32.433
founder and editor in chief
of Chocolate Monthly

01:04:32.477 --> 01:04:35.393
and one of the world's
leading chocolate connoisseurs,

01:04:35.436 --> 01:04:36.611
has been touring
the country

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.918
to name
America's best chocolate,

01:04:38.962 --> 01:04:41.312
shall be the first
to taste this new creation.

01:04:41.355 --> 01:04:43.488
It's not just
the most original

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:44.532
and best-tasting
chocolate

01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:45.925
that will win the award

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.927
and be on the cover
of my magazine,

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.321
but it's also the story
behind the chocolate

01:04:50.364 --> 01:04:52.149
that's very important.

01:04:52.192 --> 01:04:53.541
Who is Charlotte Bennett?

01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:54.934
What drives her?

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:56.370
What itch does she
like to scratch?

01:04:56.414 --> 01:04:58.677
[reporter]: Hold that thought.
Here she comes now.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.204
Bon appetit.

01:05:04.248 --> 01:05:06.554
Are you ready
for your big moment, Charlotte?

01:05:06.598 --> 01:05:08.382
I am, Nicole.

01:05:08.426 --> 01:05:09.906
And you're confident

01:05:09.949 --> 01:05:11.646
that this is the best
you have to offer?

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.431
[Charlotte]:
Never more so in my life.

01:05:13.474 --> 01:05:15.085
That's a lot to live up to

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:17.043
for a woman
of your reputation.

01:05:17.087 --> 01:05:18.436
Well,

01:05:18.479 --> 01:05:20.917
I've made a lot of mistakes
in the past, Nicole,

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.657
but I believe the key to
making a great chocolate

01:05:22.701 --> 01:05:25.225
is learning from
those mistakes

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.053
and being true
to yourself.

01:05:27.097 --> 01:05:29.055
Only then
is what you have to offer

01:05:29.099 --> 01:05:30.100
authentic.

01:05:30.143 --> 01:05:31.928
I believe that's
a word you use a lot

01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:33.625
in your reviews.

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:35.192
It is--

01:05:35.235 --> 01:05:38.238
but being authentic
is a high bar.

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.413
I agree.

01:05:39.457 --> 01:05:40.545
Most people

01:05:40.588 --> 01:05:42.590
don't know what it means
to be authentic.

01:05:42.634 --> 01:05:44.244
Genuine.

01:05:44.288 --> 01:05:45.637
Not copied
or false.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.291
Relating to or denoting

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:49.641
an emotionally appropriate,
significant, purposive,

01:05:49.684 --> 01:05:52.557
responsible mode
of human life.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.124
Adjective.

01:05:55.995 --> 01:05:58.171
So, your new flavor
is called "S.J."?

01:05:58.215 --> 01:05:59.651
What does this mean?

01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:02.959
It's personal.

01:06:03.002 --> 01:06:04.221
Hmm.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:05.265
Very clever.

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:06.266
Add a shroud of mystery

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.965
and create a buzz
all of its own.

01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:11.402
[chocolate drops] Oh!

01:06:11.445 --> 01:06:13.273
Sorry.

01:06:28.027 --> 01:06:30.029
[clearing throat]

01:06:30.073 --> 01:06:31.074
[coughing]

01:06:32.075 --> 01:06:33.337
[coughing]

01:06:35.165 --> 01:06:36.993
My throat...

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:39.082
it's all prickly.

01:06:40.431 --> 01:06:41.693
I'm allergic
to strawberries!

01:06:41.736 --> 01:06:43.129
There's strawberry in this!

01:06:43.173 --> 01:06:44.348
No!

01:06:44.391 --> 01:06:47.351
I told you
I was allergic to strawberry.

01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:50.180
I can taste strawberry
in this!

01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:52.312
No, I would never
do that!

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.531
[coughing]

01:06:53.574 --> 01:06:56.055
Jimmy, let's go.

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.143
Jimmy...

01:06:57.187 --> 01:06:58.449
I need water!

01:06:58.492 --> 01:06:59.580
I need water.

01:06:59.624 --> 01:07:01.365
No, I...
James!

01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:05.804
What?

01:07:19.122 --> 01:07:20.427
She's going to write
a review so bad,

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.647
no one will ever buy
my chocolate again.

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.520
James will never marry me.

01:07:26.564 --> 01:07:27.521
It's over.

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:29.088
Oh, this will pass.

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:31.308
There's more chocolate
to be made.

01:07:31.351 --> 01:07:32.439
Just...

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:33.701
how could this happen?

01:07:33.745 --> 01:07:36.052
There were no strawberries.

01:07:36.095 --> 01:07:38.141
Perhaps one dash too many
of something else.

01:07:39.403 --> 01:07:41.274
Back to the
drawing board,

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:43.755
but first...

01:07:43.798 --> 01:07:47.411
I want to show you something
that's going to cheer you up.

01:07:47.454 --> 01:07:48.499
Come on.

01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.544
Come on!

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.285
There...
there we go.

01:07:52.329 --> 01:07:53.286
Keep them closed.

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:55.767
Okay, keep them closed.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.508
Oh, okay.

01:07:57.551 --> 01:07:58.552
Here we go.

01:07:58.596 --> 01:07:59.597
Keep them closed.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.425
Over here,
keep them closed...

01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:02.426
and one more...

01:08:02.469 --> 01:08:04.080
step a little bit.

01:08:04.123 --> 01:08:05.298
There we go,
and...

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:06.560
open them!

01:08:06.604 --> 01:08:09.346
It's his
grandfather's car!

01:08:09.389 --> 01:08:11.087
Oscar, how did you...

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.740
Well, I contacted
the auction house,

01:08:12.784 --> 01:08:14.220
and they forwarded
my information

01:08:14.264 --> 01:08:15.221
to the buyer.

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:17.180
He got ahold of
me right away

01:08:17.223 --> 01:08:20.270
after he heard
the situation.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:21.618
Lives a few miles
from here.

01:08:21.662 --> 01:08:23.185
What, really?

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:24.622
Yeah.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:26.667
Turns out...

01:08:26.711 --> 01:08:29.104
the man has a weakness
for your chocolate.

01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:32.108
I threw in
an extra gift

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:34.197
by offering
chocolate for life.

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:36.242
Bargain,
if you ask me.

01:08:36.286 --> 01:08:38.853
Yeah, it's a...
it's an amazing bargain.

01:08:38.897 --> 01:08:39.854
Thank you.

01:08:39.898 --> 01:08:41.160
Thank you so much.

01:08:41.203 --> 01:08:42.292
Oh, you're welcome.

01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:45.121
Wow.

01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:46.774
Go call him.

01:08:46.818 --> 01:08:48.645
Uh, no.

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:51.170
I think James has probably
had enough of me.

01:08:51.214 --> 01:08:54.216
I'll just have someone
bring it to his garage.

01:08:55.653 --> 01:08:56.828
You know, I really thought

01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:58.438
he was going to like chocolate
this time.

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:05.750
Wait a minute.

01:09:08.231 --> 01:09:09.188
Hey.

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:11.321
Who cleared the table?

01:09:11.363 --> 01:09:12.844
I did. Why?

01:09:12.886 --> 01:09:14.411
Where's the wrapper from
the piece of chocolate

01:09:14.453 --> 01:09:16.194
that Nicole ate?

01:09:16.238 --> 01:09:17.370
Oh, it's right over here.

01:09:17.413 --> 01:09:18.415
Perfect.

01:09:25.857 --> 01:09:27.598
[Hannah]:
What are you doing?

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.692
What?

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:40.350
Okay, look.

01:09:40.393 --> 01:09:42.569
This is the strawberry
batch, right?

01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:43.613
The one I mixed
the other day.

01:09:43.657 --> 01:09:45.442
I got distracted,
I made a mix,

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:46.834
but I shoved it,
right?

01:09:46.877 --> 01:09:48.184
There's one missing.

01:09:49.533 --> 01:09:50.490
Okay, look.

01:09:50.533 --> 01:09:51.796
It's a blank wrapper,

01:09:51.839 --> 01:09:54.538
but the new ones
all had S.J. engraved on them.

01:09:54.581 --> 01:09:56.627
You must have accidentally
mixed them up.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:57.671
No!

01:09:57.715 --> 01:09:59.412
No, no, no,
somehow, she...

01:09:59.456 --> 01:10:00.500
she did it on purpose.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:04.243
How would she even get it?

01:10:04.287 --> 01:10:05.462
We're the only ones

01:10:05.505 --> 01:10:06.680
that even knew
these other ones existed.

01:10:06.724 --> 01:10:07.942
Mm...

01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:09.944
not exactly true.

01:10:11.772 --> 01:10:13.731
So, you feeling
any better?

01:10:15.254 --> 01:10:16.212
A little bit.

01:10:16.255 --> 01:10:18.866
I'm still
so humiliated.

01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:21.347
Well, I mean,
it was obviously a mistake.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.392
A mistake?

01:10:23.393 --> 01:10:25.351
She did it on purpose.

01:10:25.395 --> 01:10:27.353
I could tell by the way
she was looking at me

01:10:27.397 --> 01:10:28.398
when I ate the thing,

01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:29.964
there was something
up with her.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:32.489
No, why would she sabotage
the biggest moment of her life?

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:34.317
Well, I think
it's pretty obvious.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.232
She knows
that the two of you are over,

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:38.364
and she knows the reason why.

01:10:40.627 --> 01:10:41.846
Charlotte?

01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:43.717
When did you
steal it, Nicole?

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.677
Steal what?

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:49.462
The piece of chocolate
with the strawberry in it.

01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:50.463
Ah-hah!

01:10:50.507 --> 01:10:52.291
So you admit it.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:53.771
No.

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:55.251
Look, the only thing I admit

01:10:55.294 --> 01:10:57.296
is that I got distracted
one day,

01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.256
and I added some
strawberry to a mixture

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.518
that I never
intended for you,

01:11:01.561 --> 01:11:02.910
but I put it
in the back, and...

01:11:02.954 --> 01:11:04.564
look, somehow,

01:11:04.608 --> 01:11:06.392
she took a piece.

01:11:06.436 --> 01:11:07.480
She found one,
and she took a piece.

01:11:07.524 --> 01:11:08.481
Look, this...

01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:10.266
Look.

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:11.310
Okay, this is just
a generic wrapper.

01:11:11.354 --> 01:11:12.659
The one
I gave you

01:11:12.703 --> 01:11:14.879
had S.J. embossed
on the wrapper.

01:11:14.922 --> 01:11:16.750
You switched them!

01:11:16.794 --> 01:11:19.492
Oh, my goodness,
you're losing your mind.

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:20.580
You really think

01:11:20.624 --> 01:11:21.625
that I would
purposefully give myself

01:11:21.668 --> 01:11:22.974
a severe allergic reaction?

01:11:24.845 --> 01:11:26.282
When you dropped it
on the floor,

01:11:26.325 --> 01:11:27.326
that's when you made the switch.

01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:28.719
I can't believe

01:11:28.762 --> 01:11:30.547
that you went
through all of that

01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:32.766
just to make me look
like a horrible person

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:33.985
in front of James.

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:35.987
The real one's

01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:37.728
still in your purse, isn't it?

01:11:39.338 --> 01:11:40.296
Charlotte, just...

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.340
No, tell her to empty her purse.

01:11:41.384 --> 01:11:42.385
I'll do no such thing.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:43.560
James, can we just leave,
please?

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:45.344
No, just--
empty your purse.

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:46.389
No! Give it back!

01:11:50.436 --> 01:11:51.655
[James]: Charlotte, wait.

01:11:56.486 --> 01:11:57.617
I'm...

01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:58.618
Sorry.

01:11:58.662 --> 01:11:59.924
-Let me help.
-No. No.

01:11:59.967 --> 01:12:01.578
Do not touch anything.

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:07.323
I'm so sorry.

01:12:07.366 --> 01:12:08.541
James...

01:12:08.585 --> 01:12:09.760
-I love you.
-[James]: Charlotte, please.

01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:11.109
[Charlotte]: I'm going to go.
Okay? I am.

01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:14.417
Just let me say this, okay,
and then I'm gone.

01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.332
Okay.

01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:21.511
She doesn't know you
the way that I do,

01:12:21.554 --> 01:12:23.426
and she doesn't know

01:12:23.469 --> 01:12:26.907
how you brush my hair
out of my face,

01:12:26.951 --> 01:12:29.562
and you'd find
ridiculous reasons

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:30.955
to fix my car,

01:12:30.998 --> 01:12:33.044
but it's really just because
you want to see me.

01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:35.394
You were always
so selfless,

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:38.484
and you made me feel so loved

01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:40.573
and so special and important

01:12:40.617 --> 01:12:42.749
and so lucky

01:12:42.793 --> 01:12:44.011
that I had someone like you
in my life

01:12:44.055 --> 01:12:45.535
when I needed you.

01:12:45.578 --> 01:12:47.537
I love you,

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.843
and I want to be your wife,

01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:52.498
and everything is ready,
and I am going to be there.

01:12:52.542 --> 01:12:54.152
Do you think

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:56.415
he's actually going to be there
after everything you've done?

01:12:57.721 --> 01:12:58.722
I do.

01:13:01.855 --> 01:13:02.987
I'm sorry.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.621
Can we go?

01:13:28.665 --> 01:13:30.536
Ma'am? This was under
one of the tables.

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:31.972
It came out when you,
um, dropped your purse.

01:13:34.932 --> 01:13:35.933
You did switch them?

01:13:56.954 --> 01:13:58.825
Been looking for you
since last night.

01:13:58.869 --> 01:13:59.870
You weren't home.

01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:03.830
I spent the night
at Hannah's.

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:05.484
Kind of thought
I might find you here,

01:14:05.528 --> 01:14:06.920
since this is where
you always used to come

01:14:06.964 --> 01:14:08.444
after we had
a fight.

01:14:11.534 --> 01:14:13.013
We also almost
got married here once,

01:14:13.057 --> 01:14:15.451
if you remember.

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:17.191
Yeah.

01:14:17.235 --> 01:14:19.106
You deserve
so much better, James.

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.804
Oh...

01:14:20.847 --> 01:14:21.805
what's better?

01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:23.937
Well, for one,

01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:26.766
someone who doesn't
leave you at the altar...

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:28.202
twice.

01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:29.508
Yeah, I guess

01:14:29.552 --> 01:14:30.988
that's the least
one could ask for.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:35.819
The Charlotte Bennett

01:14:35.862 --> 01:14:37.124
who was going to marry me
two years ago

01:14:37.168 --> 01:14:39.953
wasn't ready to be married,

01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:42.869
but I made her feel
like she was supposed to be...

01:14:42.913 --> 01:14:44.044
and the Charlotte Bennett

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:46.656
who was supposed
to marry me a year ago

01:14:46.699 --> 01:14:47.744
was trying to make up

01:14:47.787 --> 01:14:49.833
for what she did
the year before that.

01:14:51.225 --> 01:14:54.664
This year's Charlotte Bennett,
however...

01:14:54.707 --> 01:14:56.492
now, that's complicated.

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:59.495
Involving many different
and confusing aspects.

01:14:59.538 --> 01:15:00.496
Adjective.

01:15:02.933 --> 01:15:05.152
Well, now, see,
I had to look it up.

01:15:05.196 --> 01:15:06.502
I don't have your gift,

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:09.069
but there's more
than one definition.

01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:12.899
Consisting of many
interconnecting parts

01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:15.206
or elements;

01:15:15.249 --> 01:15:16.729
intricate.

01:15:17.904 --> 01:15:19.732
Means the same thing.

01:15:19.776 --> 01:15:21.821
Not to me.

01:15:21.865 --> 01:15:23.519
You see, "intricate"

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:25.999
is kind of a nice way
to describe you.

01:15:26.043 --> 01:15:27.871
"Many fine parts."

01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:31.657
And I think that

01:15:31.701 --> 01:15:34.530
the many fine parts that
make up this Charlotte Bennett

01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:35.879
is ready to get married.

01:15:35.922 --> 01:15:38.577
Why would James Cooper
still want to marry me?

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:44.583
Because you like

01:15:44.627 --> 01:15:46.063
how I brush the hair
out of your eyes...

01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:48.979
and how I come up
with reasons

01:15:49.022 --> 01:15:50.850
to fix your car

01:15:50.894 --> 01:15:52.286
or your delivery truck

01:15:52.330 --> 01:15:54.114
when they're perfectly fine...

01:16:00.077 --> 01:16:01.644
and you know

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:05.169
that you make me
feel so loved,

01:16:05.212 --> 01:16:07.214
and important,

01:16:07.258 --> 01:16:09.260
and smart.

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:11.741
Even after I broke
your heart?

01:16:12.872 --> 01:16:15.092
You didn't break
my heart.

01:16:17.834 --> 01:16:19.705
You're what keeps it beating.

01:16:41.379 --> 01:16:42.293

01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:45.905
I'm not big on chocolate.

01:16:45.949 --> 01:16:46.906
Yeah, I know.

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:48.168
It's different
this time.

01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:50.693
Just try it.

01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.958

stand for?
