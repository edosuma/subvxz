00:03.304 --> 00:05.206
Happy New Year, Chris!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.375
CHRIS ROCK:
New Year's Eve
was big in Bed-Stuy

00:07.408 --> 00:09.110
because it gave everybody

00:09.143 --> 00:11.112
a chance to make
new resolutions.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.381
Unfortunately, most people
didn't follow through on them.

00:13.414 --> 00:16.050
Not my mother.

00:16.084 --> 00:18.352
This year, I'm going to stop
yelling at my children.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.154
No, you're not!

00:20.188 --> 00:23.191
Who put a glass on my table
without a coaster?!

00:25.826 --> 00:27.428
Not my sister.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.264
This year I'm not going to
get Chris in trouble anymore.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.532
Yes, you will.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.833
ROCHELLE:
Who's been in my make!

00:32.866 --> 00:34.802
Chris did it!!

00:35.736 --> 00:37.771
Not my father.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.240
I'm going to stop
worrying about money.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.541
Stop lying!

00:40.574 --> 00:41.575
Chris, close that door!

00:41.609 --> 00:44.378
You just let out 86 cent
worth of refrigeration.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.382
Not my brother.

00:48.416 --> 00:50.784
This year, I'm not going to take
any more girls from Chris.

00:50.818 --> 00:52.220
We'll see about that.

00:52.253 --> 00:53.687
That's so
sweet, Drew.

00:53.721 --> 00:54.422
Who's Chris?

00:56.157 --> 00:58.126
I'm Chris.
You came in with me.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.194
But I was going
to be different.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.233
Last year, this is how
I celebrated New Year's Eve.

01:07.135 --> 01:09.270
So I made a resolution
that my next New Year's Eve

01:09.303 --> 01:10.871
would be different.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.542
So, you doing anything special
for New Year's Eve, Chris?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.644
I'm going down
to Times Square to
watch the ball drop.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.546
Times Square?
You crazy?

01:18.579 --> 01:21.815
The only people down there
are drunks and pickpockets.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.552
I don't care, it's the biggest
New Year's celebration on Earth

01:24.585 --> 01:26.720
and I live 20 minutes
from it and I haven't been.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.322
Well...,

01:28.356 --> 01:31.192
I sell New Year's,
I don't celebrate it.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.760
Why not?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.595
Because anything could happen.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.764
You remember when
Michael Jackson

01:36.797 --> 01:38.332
got his hair caught on fire?

01:38.366 --> 01:41.735
I bet you any money
he celebrated New Year's.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.604
And look what happened.

01:43.637 --> 01:46.807
If I get through tonight,
I'll celebrate tomorrow.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.842
Doc was the only person
I knew who celebrated

01:48.876 --> 01:50.378
Old New Year's Eve.

01:50.411 --> 01:51.912
Is your mama going
to let you go down there?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.147
I don't see why not.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.448
All I got to do is ask.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.350
Ma, can I go
to Times Square

01:56.384 --> 01:58.319
to watch
the ball drop?
No.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.853
Happy New Year!

02:12.300 --> 02:15.336
* Ah, make it funky now.

CHRIS ROCK:
I wanted to be in Times Square

02:35.389 --> 02:37.458
when the clock struck midnight,
but I struck out.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.392
Come on, ma, why not?

02:38.426 --> 02:40.861
I mean all we do is
stay up till 11:59,

02:40.894 --> 02:42.263
say, "Happy New Year,"
blow a noisemaker,

02:42.296 --> 02:43.264
and then go to sleep.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.898
I want to do
something different.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.734
Like what?
Get drunk,

02:46.767 --> 02:47.968
rip your shirt off
in the freezing cold

02:48.001 --> 02:50.271
and have the cops
arrest you

02:50.304 --> 02:51.705
and spend the first day
of the new year in jail?

02:51.739 --> 02:53.474
Who wants to do that?
Lindsay Lohan!

02:53.507 --> 02:55.343
Well, obviously, you do.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.944
That's what happens to people
who go to Times Square.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.412
I just want to see
the ball drop.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.413
You can't
go with me?

02:59.447 --> 03:00.881
I don't have
the time, Chris.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.516
I got to soak my
black eyed peas,

03:02.550 --> 03:04.918
I got to pull my greens,
I got to clean them...

03:04.952 --> 03:06.420
She's a bale of cotton away

03:06.454 --> 03:08.256
from setting us back
300 years.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.224
Why do you have to do all that
stuff every year anyway?

03:10.258 --> 03:12.593
It's a tradition, Chris.
It's for good luck.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.896
There's a reason black people
think vegetables are lucky.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.732
They're coming, quick,
hide behind these greens.

03:29.577 --> 03:32.280
Should've ate some greens
before I came and asked you.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.347
Ooh, you better watch your mouth

03:33.381 --> 03:35.583
unless you want to get
smacked into the new year.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.552
Drew, Tonya, get in here!

03:42.623 --> 03:43.824
Okay, here's the list.

03:43.857 --> 03:44.958
Make sure you
get everything.

03:44.992 --> 03:47.361
Can I stay up and watch
Rocking New Year's Eve?

03:47.395 --> 03:48.429
The Jets are on.

03:48.462 --> 03:49.730
The football team?

03:49.763 --> 03:50.998
No, they're a
singing group.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.933
They're just like
the Jacksons, only Samoan.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.768
Oh, fine, but just
hurry up, and, Drew,

03:54.802 --> 03:55.969
do not forget
the kitty litter.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.405
Okay.

03:57.438 --> 04:02.009
Meanwhile, my father was on
a bridge over troubled water.

04:02.042 --> 04:03.977
Hey, what's
going on up there?

04:04.011 --> 04:06.347
Some idiot's threatening
to jump off the bridge.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.948
Why couldn't he jump
off the Triborough?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.318
We're going to be
out here all day.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.719
What?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.020
Man, I'm trying to get home.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.491
While Tonya was
planning on staying up,

04:17.525 --> 04:20.060
Drew was planning on
taking her down.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.296
* I've got a
crush on you *

04:22.330 --> 04:23.531
I don't know why
you're singing.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.899
You know you're going to fall
asleep before the Jets come on.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.034
You never make it
past 10:00.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.502
I bet you
I do tonight.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.538
I bet you don't.
How much?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.640
If you fall asleep,
you owe me 20 bucks.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.907
And if you fall
asleep, I'm going

04:33.941 --> 04:35.008
to glue your hand
to your face.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.610
I don't see how
since you won't have

04:36.644 --> 04:37.611
money for glue.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.449
Meanwhile, if I wanted
to keep my resolution,

04:41.482 --> 04:43.351
it was going to take
some resolve.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.585
Mom...
No, Chris.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.421
But I made one resolution and
that was to go to Times Square.

04:47.455 --> 04:48.422
That's not my fault.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.623
But it's my resolution.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.425
Is that what
you want for me,

04:51.459 --> 04:52.460
to end up in prison?

04:52.493 --> 04:53.661
What?

04:53.694 --> 04:55.463
I'm just saying,
I made a resolution

04:55.496 --> 04:56.964
and if I accept
no for an answer,

04:56.997 --> 04:58.031
that means
I accept defeat.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.533
Then I'll fall into
a crowd of people

04:59.567 --> 05:01.369
who have no hopes or dreams,
and eventually,

05:01.402 --> 05:02.803
I end up in the wrong place
at the wrong time

05:02.836 --> 05:05.038
doing the wrong thing
and that ends in prison.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.874
Well, can you find
somebody else to take you?

05:06.907 --> 05:08.008
I can try.

05:08.041 --> 05:09.910
Get out of here, boy.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.514
Back on the bridge,
a man was suicidal

05:13.547 --> 05:15.949
and my father
wanted to kill him.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.585
What are you
doing up here, man?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.820
Do you know you got
traffic backed up

05:19.853 --> 05:21.889
all the way to exit
the Lincoln Tunnel?

05:21.922 --> 05:23.391
It's New Year's Eve!

05:23.424 --> 05:25.359
People are trying
to get home.

05:25.393 --> 05:27.795
I can't do
anything right.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.498
So you think you can fix that
by jumping off a bridge?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.700
Give me one good
reason I shouldn't.

05:32.733 --> 05:35.035
He shouldn't have said that.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.638
What if everybody
who ever had a problem

05:37.671 --> 05:40.007
jumped off a bridge?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.509
Geraldine Ferraro
could've been

05:41.542 --> 05:43.577
our country's first
female Vice President,

05:43.611 --> 05:45.679
but her party lost.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.615
She didn't jump
off a bridge.

05:47.648 --> 05:51.385
Nelson Mandela's been
in jail for over 20 years.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.721
He didn't jump
off a bridge.

05:53.754 --> 05:57.090
Ivan Lendl got stomped
by Boris Becker at Wimbledon.

05:57.124 --> 05:59.693
Didn't jump off a bridge.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.062
Trevor Berbick,
he got knocked out

06:02.095 --> 06:04.865
by Mike Tyson in less
than five minutes.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.435
He didn't jump
off a bridge!

06:07.468 --> 06:09.737
Jermaine Jackson
got kicked out
of the Jacksons.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.872
My father was on the bridge,

06:11.905 --> 06:13.541
and soon after,
he was on the air.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.544
What!

06:16.577 --> 06:17.445
Quick, turn on the TV.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.112
Your father is on!
He stopped some guy

06:19.146 --> 06:21.415
from jumping off the
George Washington Bridge.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.917
Okay, I'll call you back.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.153
What channel?
All three of them.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.755
JULIUS:
Jermaine Jackson got
kicked out of the Jacksons.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.090
He didn't jump off a bridge.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.792
Julius, you're
a real hero.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.428
You saved a life,
but more importantly,

06:34.462 --> 06:35.896
you got traffic moving again.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.665
Back to you at the studio.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.100
The Chicago Cubs haven't won
a World Series since 1908.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.769
They didn't jump off a bridge.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.171
James Earl Jones
lost the Oscar

06:44.204 --> 06:45.839
for his performance
in The Great White Hope.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.608
He didn't jump off a bridge.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.443
No.
Trevor Berbick
got knocked out

06:49.477 --> 06:51.479
by Mike Tyson
in less than five minutes.

06:51.512 --> 06:53.113
He did not jump off a bridge.

06:53.146 --> 06:56.684
Oh, my God,
your father's a star.

06:56.717 --> 06:57.818
Wow!

06:57.851 --> 07:00.654
Did he jump off a bridge? No.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.922
Well, Julius,
you're just full of--

07:01.955 --> 07:03.023
Remember that movie,
Top Gun?

07:03.056 --> 07:05.593
While my dad was
getting off the bridge,

07:05.626 --> 07:07.695
I was trying to
get out of the house.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.896
I can't believe
your dad saved a guy.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.731
That's so cool.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.066
You know, if that guy had been
a girl, he'd be so in there.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.235
Another one of Greg's
pickup techniques.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.770
If you stop a girl
from killing herself,

07:16.804 --> 07:18.005
she might go out with you.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.473
Listen, what you doing tonight?

07:19.507 --> 07:22.175
Well, my mom's got a
new boyfriend, he's Asian.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.577
They're talking about
going down to Times Square.

07:23.611 --> 07:24.545
What about you?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.246
Times Square, are you serious?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.581
I've been trying to find
somebody to take me

07:27.615 --> 07:28.749
'cause my mom can't do it.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.883
Why don't you just come with us?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.519
Let me check with my mom,
I'll call you right back.

07:31.552 --> 07:33.153
All right, I'll talk to you.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.688
Ma, that was Greg.

07:34.722 --> 07:35.756
His mom is taking him
down to Times Square.

07:35.789 --> 07:36.824
You think I could
go with them?

07:36.857 --> 07:38.659
Greg? I guess that's okay.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.760
Thanks.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.061
Go get me some water.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.970
Hello?
Dude, it's Greg.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.639
What'd she say?
I got some bad news.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.508
They're going to
celebrate New Year's Eve,

07:54.542 --> 07:57.545
but it's not in Times Square,
it's in Tiananmen Square.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.180
And it's not tonight,
it's the Chinese New Year.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.015
So it's not till February.

08:02.049 --> 08:04.652
But she said you can
still come if you want.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.687
To China? No, I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.888
Sorry, dude.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.124
Too bad I didn't make
a New Year's resolution

08:11.158 --> 08:13.126
to be depressed.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.299
CHRIS ROCK:
Since Greg didn't
come through in the clutch,

08:19.332 --> 08:21.769
I decided to see who could
come through on the block.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.537
I tried Risky.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.238
My mom said if I can find a
responsible adult to take me

08:25.272 --> 08:26.840
I can go down to Times Square.

08:26.874 --> 08:27.841
Aw, sorry, man, I can't.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.844
I've got to deliver some
time-sensitive products.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.012
What type of products?

08:32.045 --> 08:35.849
:
1986 calendars.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.651
I tried Mr. Omar.

08:37.685 --> 08:40.220
I'm sorry, Chris,
I can't take you.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.089
For an undertaker,
New Year's Eve is like

08:42.122 --> 08:44.625
the day before the
after Christmas sale.

08:44.658 --> 08:48.762
People act like drunken fools
tonight, and dead tomorrow.

08:48.796 --> 08:50.598
Tragic, tragic!

08:56.970 --> 08:58.772
I even tried Kill Moves.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.974
I had to start using the word
"responsible" loosely.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.242
Kill Moves, wake up.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.212
I'm awake, I just
got my eyes closed.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.581
I'm testing their opacity.

09:07.615 --> 09:08.616
What do you need?

09:08.649 --> 09:09.917
I was wondering if you
wanted to go with me tonight

09:09.950 --> 09:11.184
to see the ball drop
in Times Square.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.653
I would love to!

09:12.686 --> 09:14.054
But I can't see
through my eyelids,

09:14.087 --> 09:15.789
so I don't see what
the point would be.

09:16.924 --> 09:21.061
Hey, hey, Chris

09:21.094 --> 09:25.165
That New Year's Eve, my father
was on TV more than Dick Clark.

09:25.198 --> 09:27.801
Hey, look, there's
Dad on TV again!

09:27.835 --> 09:29.102
JULIUS:
So, I climbed up the girder

09:29.136 --> 09:30.804
to where the guy
was sitting and I said,

09:30.838 --> 09:34.341
"What if everybody who ever had
a problem jumped off a bridge?"

09:34.374 --> 09:36.744
Climbed up a girder?

09:36.777 --> 09:38.211
To keep from falling asleep,

09:38.245 --> 09:40.681
Tonya got herself
a secret weapon.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.750
Instant coffee.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.153
For staying awake, it's the
next best thing to crack.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.221
Hey, Tonya,
come watch Dad on TV.

09:48.255 --> 09:52.025
I am, I just got to go
to the bathroom first.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.162
The Chicago Cubs haven't won
the World Series since 1908.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.898
They didn't
jump off a bridge.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.633
Dad's on TV again?

09:59.667 --> 10:01.101
Yeah, before he
talked that guy down,

10:01.134 --> 10:02.736
he had to climb up to the
top of the bridge to do it.

10:02.770 --> 10:03.937
It was so cool.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.173
No, that was not cool,
it was crazy.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.574
It was crazy-cool!

10:07.607 --> 10:11.779
We're here at Chris' house
where we've secretly replaced

10:11.812 --> 10:14.848
the fine coffee they usually
serve with Folgers Crystals.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.984
Let's see if anyone
can tell the difference.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.825
Maybe that wasn't Folgers!

10:24.858 --> 10:27.427
Chris, did you find somebody
to take you to Times Square?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.730
Not yet. You think
Dad could take me?

10:29.763 --> 10:32.399
Oh, well, go climb up a bridge
and maybe he'll come get you.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.434
Give me that.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.937
Hello?

10:36.970 --> 10:37.938
Hey, honey, it's me.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.239
Where are you?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.674
I just got off an interview.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.142
It's crazy!

10:42.175 --> 10:43.877
This morning I was just
coming home from work and--

10:43.911 --> 10:46.914
I know what you've been doing,
it's all over the news.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.281
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:48.315 --> 10:50.751
What? I just talked
a man down from--

10:50.784 --> 10:52.820
No, you didn't just
talk a man down.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.989
You just climbed up onto
a girder to talk a man down.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.390
While you were up there
saving his life,

10:57.424 --> 10:58.992
did you think
about your family?

10:59.026 --> 11:01.228
I mean, what if that
fool would've jumped

11:01.261 --> 11:02.262
and took you with him?

11:02.295 --> 11:03.731
Did you think about that?

11:03.764 --> 11:05.065
I saved his life.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.034
And you almost
got yourself killed.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.202
Your son needed you,
and you were out there

11:09.236 --> 11:11.271
on top of the George
Washington Bridge.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.405
Needed me for what?

11:12.439 --> 11:13.240
You know what?

11:13.273 --> 11:14.942
I'm not even gonna
deal with this.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.076
Chris, it's for you.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.845
It's Spider-Man.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.947
If he doesn't come home soon,
she's gonna be the Black Widow.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.282
Hey, Dad, I was wondering
if you could take me down

11:22.315 --> 11:24.017
to Times Square to see
the ball drop tonight.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.086
Yeah, man, I'd love to...

11:26.119 --> 11:26.954
All right, cool,
I'll go get ready.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.488
I'd love to, but I can't.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.190
I have to go downtown
with the mayor

11:30.223 --> 11:31.792
and get the key to the city.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.026
Then dinner with Batman.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.461
I probably won't
be back in time.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.463
The traffic's still
pretty bad out here.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.498
Why don't you get
your mother to take you?

11:38.531 --> 11:41.201
Just because I can't go
to Times Square tonight,

11:41.234 --> 11:43.871
am I gonna jump off a bridge?

11:48.041 --> 11:50.778
When I realized my resolution
wasn't going to work out,

11:50.811 --> 11:53.847
I decided to make a new one--
no more resolutions.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.449
Hey, baby, what you doing?

11:56.483 --> 11:58.151
Getting ready for tonight.

11:58.185 --> 12:00.287
Well, I'm sorry you couldn't
find anybody to go with.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.488
Maybe next year.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.990
Yeah.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.793
Tasha is downstairs.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.064
Hey, Chris.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.232
I saw your dad on TV.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.901
That was really brave,
what he did.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.836
Yeah, I guess.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.840
What's wrong?
Nothing.
I was just

12:19.873 --> 12:21.441
hoping my dad could take me
to Times Square tonight,

12:21.474 --> 12:23.076
but he's all tied up
with these interviews.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.344
I'm going to Times
Square tonight

12:24.377 --> 12:25.879
with my mom and Malvo.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.080
Why don't you come with us?

12:27.114 --> 12:28.949
I don't think she'll let me.

12:28.982 --> 12:29.983
Why not?

12:30.017 --> 12:31.084
You know why.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.153
Well, you can at least ask.

12:33.186 --> 12:38.358
Ma! Can I go to Times Square
with Tasha, Peaches and Malvo?

12:38.391 --> 12:40.460
ROCHELLE:
Hell, no!

12:49.102 --> 12:50.804
While my mother got
ready for New Years,

12:50.838 --> 12:51.939
Peaches got ready to rumble.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.875
How come you won't let Chris
go to Times Square with me?

12:54.908 --> 12:56.509
Well, hello, Peaches.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.412
You know what, Rochelle?
If we are gonna be friends,

12:59.446 --> 13:02.082
at some point you are gonna
have to learn how to trust me.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.918
Mmm... Now, I'll trust you
with some clothes,

13:04.952 --> 13:07.054
but trusting you with my
children, that's another thing.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.588
Not to Britney Spears.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.190
Oh! Huh.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.025
And why is that?

13:12.059 --> 13:13.226
You know why.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.261
No, no, no, no.
Say it. Say it.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.997
No, no, no. Say it.
I want to hear you say it.

13:17.030 --> 13:19.432
Um... you're an ex-convict.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.968
Oh, my God, she said it.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.503
She said it.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.438
Rochelle,
what you think I'ma do?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.108
I got it!

13:28.141 --> 13:29.877
Drive the car, Chris.
Drive the car! Drive the car!

13:29.910 --> 13:32.045
Drive the car!

13:32.079 --> 13:34.982
Peaches, I don't have
to give you a reason.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.516
Rochelle, you know what?

13:36.549 --> 13:39.186
My parole officer said I am
proof that the system works.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.088
I am a new me.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.522
I have learned
from my mistakes.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.524
I have paid my debt to society.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.593
And you want to open a new
line of credit with my child.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.129
Well, if not yours,
then whose

13:49.162 --> 13:51.431
She got to go with me.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.166
Now, how am I supposed to feel

13:53.200 --> 13:55.168
improved and empowered by that?

13:55.202 --> 13:57.070
Peaches, this is not about you.

13:57.104 --> 14:00.140
Yes, it is. You not not letting
him go with somebody else.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.610
Peaches,
it's dangerous down there.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.312
Rochelle, don't you
think I know that?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.181
That's why I got Malvo coming.

14:08.215 --> 14:11.484
Oh, that's nice--
another ex-convict!

14:11.518 --> 14:13.987
Ex! Ex, Rochelle.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.422
That means "former."

14:15.455 --> 14:16.990
"Used to be."

14:17.024 --> 14:19.092
"Not currently."

14:19.126 --> 14:20.627
And you know what?

14:20.660 --> 14:22.896
This is what's really,
'cause it makes me...

14:22.930 --> 14:25.532
and I'm gonna be
upset about this now.

14:25.565 --> 14:29.569
If you won't let me move on,
then it's only a matter of time

14:29.602 --> 14:31.438
before I become an accomplice
all over again.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.040
Now, do you want that
on your head?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.975
Peaches.

14:35.008 --> 14:38.078
Please, girl. Look, we
gonna follow the rules.

14:38.111 --> 14:40.180
We'll cross at the green
not between.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.049
We won't jump any turnstiles.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.985
Even though that is
a family tradition.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.988
And, listen, Tasha really,
really wants Chris to go.

14:48.021 --> 14:49.289
You know, they'll have fun.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.424
We'll be careful.
I promise.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.594
Fine.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.628
What you say?

14:55.662 --> 14:56.496
Fine.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.531
Okay, girl, I'll see you later.
Chris!

14:58.565 --> 15:01.534
Your mother said
you could go, boy!

15:02.735 --> 15:05.338
Hurry up before
she change her mind!

15:05.372 --> 15:06.639
Bye, girl.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.075
All right, then.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.177
Happy New Year.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.650
Okay, Chris.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.686
Now, with all the
traffic and the people,

15:19.719 --> 15:21.521
you won't get home till
early in the morning,

15:21.554 --> 15:23.156
but you're gonna be
the first male

15:23.190 --> 15:25.058
to walk through the door
for the New Year.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.526
So, here's $20.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.660
Keep it in your wallet.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.396
That's to bring us
luck and good fortune

15:29.429 --> 15:30.597
for the rest of the year.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.631
You got it.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.166
Okay. Oh, I love you, baby.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.502
Mmm.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.504
Be safe.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.006
Be careful.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.049
Even though my resolution
was coming to pass,

15:49.082 --> 15:51.151
it didn't matter
when it came to the cops.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

15:52.252 --> 15:55.055
I'm sorry, folks,
we're at capacity. All right?

15:55.088 --> 15:56.990
We got over two million
people in there now.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.591
Capacity?
It's Times Square.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.663
Well, what difference is
four more people gonna make?

16:03.696 --> 16:05.132
We came all the way
from Bed-Stuy.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.266
Well, you should've
came earlier.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.500
Now step back.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.302
Oh. Ah!
No, no, no, no, baby.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.737
No, no, no.
If I wasn't on parole,

16:10.770 --> 16:12.505
I swear.
Where's my...

16:12.539 --> 16:14.074
What are we
gonna do now?

16:14.107 --> 16:15.508
Maybe we should find
a bar or something

16:15.542 --> 16:16.676
and watch it on TV.
Nah!

16:16.709 --> 16:18.611
Nah, we seeing
this ball drop.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.547
I know what to do.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.649
I'll be right back.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.552
Come on, come on,
come over here.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.488
They're shooting!
They're shooting!

16:28.521 --> 16:29.622
Officer! Officer!

16:29.656 --> 16:31.024
White man with a gun!

16:31.058 --> 16:32.192
It looked like Chevy Chase!
He's over there!

16:32.225 --> 16:33.293
He's over there?

16:33.326 --> 16:35.262
He's over there! He's...

16:35.295 --> 16:37.230
Come on, y'all, let's go.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.665
Who's shooting?

16:38.698 --> 16:40.067
PEACHES:
Ain't nobody shooting, boy.
Come on.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.068
CHRIS:
I heard some gunshots!

16:41.101 --> 16:42.635
MALVO:
Come on, baby, yeah.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.671
While we were trying
to get into Times Square,

16:44.704 --> 16:46.606
my dad was trying
to get through traffic.

16:46.639 --> 16:47.740
Come on, people!

16:49.342 --> 16:51.578
My father had
the key to the city,

16:51.611 --> 16:53.780
but it couldn't open gridlock.

16:53.813 --> 16:57.384
Back home, Tonya was awake
and Drew had glue on his face.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.586
Girl, would you stop all that
hopping up and help me

16:59.619 --> 17:01.288
put these bags in the window?

17:01.321 --> 17:03.356
Do you think Daddy's gonna
make it home before midnight?

17:03.390 --> 17:04.624
I hope so.

17:06.093 --> 17:07.760
* You found out

17:07.794 --> 17:10.063
TONYA:
* I've got a crush on you...

17:10.097 --> 17:12.665
While Tonya's heart
was beating a mile a minute,

17:12.699 --> 17:15.302
my dad was driving
at the same rate of speed.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.538
MAN :
That was "I've Got a Crush
on You" by The Jets,"

17:18.571 --> 17:20.140
helping to bring in
the new year,

17:21.341 --> 17:23.276
Get outta the way!

17:27.347 --> 17:28.415
I never really
believed in things

17:28.448 --> 17:30.383
like New Year's resolutions,

17:30.417 --> 17:32.252
but for the first time
in my life,

17:32.285 --> 17:35.322
I remember thinking
that dreams can come true.

17:35.355 --> 17:39.126
:
Once again, it's New Year's Eve
in Times Square.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.328
Happy New Year from all of us.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.363
CROWD:
Ten!

17:44.364 --> 17:46.433
Nine!

17:46.466 --> 17:47.667
Eight!

17:48.868 --> 17:50.137
Seven!

17:51.338 --> 17:53.206
Six!

17:53.240 --> 17:54.607
Five!

17:55.908 --> 17:58.778
Four!

17:58.811 --> 18:01.348
Three!

18:01.381 --> 18:04.217
Two!

18:04.251 --> 18:06.186
One!

18:06.219 --> 18:10.490
Happy New Year!

18:10.523 --> 18:12.159
(fusillade of gunfire,
glass shattering)

18:17.364 --> 18:19.366
Happy New Year, baby!

18:19.399 --> 18:21.401
Happy New Year!

18:22.769 --> 18:26.473
* Should old acquaintance
be forgot *

18:26.506 --> 18:28.775
* And never brought to mind...

18:28.808 --> 18:30.643
Kissing Tasha on New Year's Eve
was amazing.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.844
My only fear was that

18:31.878 --> 18:34.481
I was gonna turn
into a pumpkin at midnight.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.850
* In days of auld lang syne

18:37.884 --> 18:41.821
* For auld lang syne, my dear

18:41.854 --> 18:45.725
* For auld lang syne

18:45.758 --> 18:49.429
* We'll take a cup
of kindness yet *

18:49.462 --> 18:53.266
* For the sake
of auld lang syne. *

18:57.937 --> 19:00.340
Chris. So, how did it go?

19:00.373 --> 19:02.309
Great. It was the best
night of my life.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.544
Did you have
any problems?
No.

19:04.577 --> 19:06.379
Did anybody get arrested?
No.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.215
Detained?
No.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.949
Searched?
No.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.384
Questioned?

19:11.418 --> 19:12.852
No. It was perfect.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.754
Damn. I forgot the
first guy in the house

19:14.787 --> 19:16.289
supposed to have
money in his pocket.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.558
No, no, no, no, baby,
I already took care of that.

19:18.591 --> 19:21.328
I made sure you were in
the house before midnight,

19:21.361 --> 19:22.962
and before Chris left,
I gave him $20

19:22.995 --> 19:24.897
to ensure that we would
have luck and good fortune

19:24.931 --> 19:26.098
for the rest of the year.

19:26.132 --> 19:28.435
Just in case the black-eyed
peas don't work.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.638
So now, if you will kindly
give me my $20 back

19:31.671 --> 19:34.707
so we can get
this year started.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.314
Boy, don't play with me.
Give me my money.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.251
Hey, y'all.
Sorry to bother you.

19:44.284 --> 19:45.218
I let myself in.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.986
Peaches needed me to
come through the door

19:47.019 --> 19:48.821
with some money in my
pocket since I was gonna

19:48.855 --> 19:50.423
be the first man
through the door

19:50.457 --> 19:53.326
after midnight,
so I pickpocketed Chris.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.662
Anyway, I just wanted

19:55.695 --> 19:57.597
to give you back...
your wallet.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.500
Happy New Year!

20:07.340 --> 20:09.276
He was supposed to have
that money in his pocket.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.644
And now we're gonna
have bad luck

20:11.678 --> 20:12.945
for the rest of the year.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.816
Great.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.319
Happy New Year!

20:20.953 --> 20:22.622
* Everybody hates Chris.
