16:26.266 --> 16:27.600
- There's, like, the chicken
and the egg,

16:27.633 --> 16:30.200
the egg and the chicken.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.367
- Oh, yeah.
- Like father, like son, man.

16:35.300 --> 16:36.500
- Oh!

16:36.533 --> 16:39.066
- It's my ----ing birthday,
bitches!

16:39.100 --> 16:41.133
- No, I just smashed it
over there.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.633
- Oh, my God.
Look at it.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.133
♪ ♪

16:44.166 --> 16:46.367
- It's your birthday!
- Hey!

16:46.400 --> 16:48.033
- Happy birthday!

16:48.066 --> 16:49.133
- Drinks for everybody!
- Yes!

16:49.166 --> 16:51.066
- Let's get this party started!

16:51.100 --> 16:52.200
- Let's get it started.

16:52.233 --> 16:55.100
- Here.
Happy birthday!

16:55.133 --> 16:57.033
- Breathe it!
Breathe it!

16:59.467 --> 17:00.633
- I think I need to get

17:00.667 --> 17:02.300
another breast reduction
and lift,

17:02.333 --> 17:04.133
because it's like--
it's already sagged,

17:04.166 --> 17:05.500
'cause I don't wear bras,
and I need to just--

17:05.533 --> 17:07.133
every year,
I need to do another one.

17:07.166 --> 17:08.367
- Here's the cake..

17:08.400 --> 17:10.533
.
Ooh.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.066
- Oh, yeah, triple berry.
- I figured summer bod.

17:14.100 --> 17:15.600
That's why I brought one
with three forks.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.000
- I love it!

17:17.033 --> 17:19.066
Okay, I have got to ask you

17:19.100 --> 17:21.633
what your input is,
like, on James.

17:21.667 --> 17:24.633
- 'Cause Hope has made up
several stories in the past.

17:24.667 --> 17:26.333
- Oh, so Hope's a liar.

17:26.367 --> 17:27.567
So you think
they never hooked up.

17:27.600 --> 17:28.633
- Oh, no, I'm saying I do.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.333
- Okay, so Hope's not a liar.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.300
- I think that something
with the two of them

17:32.333 --> 17:34.266
absolutely happened
since he's been with Raquel.

17:34.300 --> 17:36.433
- Okay, so Scheana's
on Hope's side.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.300
- I don't think everything
Hope said is true.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.567
I really don't.
- Wait, so

17:39.600 --> 17:41.166
Scheana's not on Hope's side.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.667
So if you know
that something happened,

17:42.700 --> 17:44.133
then you--
- I know that she set

17:44.166 --> 17:45.667
something up, but I don't know.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.300
- She just flip-flops.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.166
- You know me!
I want to act

17:49.200 --> 17:50.333
like everything's, like--

17:50.367 --> 17:51.600
- Exactly!
- Yeah, I'm not

17:51.633 --> 17:53.200
doing that anymore.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.133
- Did Scheana just flip-flop

17:55.166 --> 17:56.533
on flip

17:56.567 --> 17:58.133
It's like, I can't.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.467
You do have the power
to do something.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.133
You really do.
- The interactions we're in.

18:01.166 --> 18:03.166
- I know.
- And I feel like you've been

18:03.200 --> 18:06.266
used to wanting to make sure
everybody's happy with you...

18:06.300 --> 18:07.467
- Yeah.
- And--and--

18:07.500 --> 18:08.467
and you're friends
with everyone

18:08.500 --> 18:10.100
that it ends up

18:10.133 --> 18:11.400
just ----ing biting you
in the ass,

18:11.433 --> 18:13.333
and it just makes
everyone bitter,

18:13.367 --> 18:17.233
because you have
no loyalty to anyone.

18:17.266 --> 18:18.500
- Coming up:

18:18.533 --> 18:20.300
- I did text you all

18:20.333 --> 18:22.633
that I was thinking
about, like, asking Raquel.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.300
- I thought you were joking.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.300
- Yeah, and she says
she's gonna come.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.533
- I want to get out
of the noise.

18:37.567 --> 18:39.233
- So I have some good news.

18:39.266 --> 18:43.266
Lisa wants to get you back
on the schedule.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.567
Yeah, you need that money
to get--

18:44.600 --> 18:46.400
pay off that ring.
You know what I mean?

18:46.433 --> 18:47.767
- I need a lot more than that,
but this is a start.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.400
I'm back, baby.

18:49.433 --> 18:51.166
- Congratulations.
- I appreciate it.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.567
Thank you, yeah.
A lot of my money's

18:52.600 --> 18:54.734
going to that ----ing ring.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.467
I hope I remember
how to make a Pump-tini.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.667
Thank you.
Hey, thanks

18:58.700 --> 19:00.133
for doing that, man.
Appreciate that.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.400
- Of course.
You got it.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.734
- Birthday season
has officially started.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.767
- I know, I know.
- And now--and now our party

19:05.000 --> 19:06.400
has to be, like--

19:10.433 --> 19:12.133
Again.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.367
I've always been able

19:13.400 --> 19:15.367
to see a friendship
with Ariana.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.667
I have always liked her.

19:16.700 --> 19:18.734
She's the one
that didn't like me.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.467
You hurt my feelings,

19:20.500 --> 19:21.700
like, three times tonight.

19:21.734 --> 19:23.300
- You're asserting your opinion

19:23.333 --> 19:26.166
as if I should be listening
to it.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.000
- You're so emotional,
and I don't know how

19:28.033 --> 19:29.367
to c--have that conversation
with someone

19:29.400 --> 19:30.700
who's so emotional.
- Then don't

19:30.734 --> 19:32.700
have a conversation with me.
- So heated.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.300
I never did.
- Don't be here.

19:34.333 --> 19:35.333
Then I don't understand
what you're doing.

19:35.367 --> 19:36.433
- Because I care
about Katie.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.600
I don't give a
about you.

19:38.633 --> 19:41.700
- But becoming friends
with Ariana was pretty easy.

19:41.734 --> 19:44.734
I just went to all the parties
and events she was at,

19:44.767 --> 19:47.200
and followed her around
until she was either forced

19:47.233 --> 19:49.233
to, like, take out
a restraining order

19:49.266 --> 19:50.433
or hang out with me.

19:50.467 --> 19:52.400
- She was really wanting
to be my friend,

19:52.433 --> 19:54.300
and so nice to me
for so long

19:54.333 --> 19:56.200
that at a certain point,
I kind of just

19:56.233 --> 19:58.433
gave up the energy
to be bitchy anymore.

19:58.467 --> 20:01.233
- It was basically
like Stalking 101.

20:04.400 --> 20:05.667
- Like--
- You just kissed

20:05.700 --> 20:07.467
a pinky promise with me.

20:10.367 --> 20:13.300
- Knowing Ariana
over the past seven years,

20:13.333 --> 20:14.767
the things she's said
about Stassi--

20:15.000 --> 20:16.400
that she never wants
to be her friend,

20:16.433 --> 20:17.667
she doesn't give a
about her,

20:17.700 --> 20:19.467
she can't stand her,
she's annoying--

20:19.500 --> 20:21.266
I do worry that, like,
I mean, is Stassi

20:21.300 --> 20:22.734
talking sh-- about me
to Ariana?

20:22.767 --> 20:24.433
Are they, like,
getting really close,

20:24.467 --> 20:25.700
and then I'm on the outs?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.433
- With our talents combined,

20:27.467 --> 20:29.033
we will have the best
birthday party

20:29.066 --> 20:30.600
that ever ----ing happened.

20:30.633 --> 20:33.300
- I mean, Ariana is still
one of my best friends.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.433
Like, I don't really know
where I stand, I guess.

20:36.467 --> 20:38.433
- Queen of ----ing birthdays.

20:38.467 --> 20:41.533
- Sandoval's gonna make us
some TomTom shots.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.333
- Oh, wait till you see
the drinks at TomTom.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.333
Dude, they're
so ----ing complicated.

20:45.367 --> 20:47.533
- Tomorrow, we're planning,
like, a girls' night.

20:47.567 --> 20:49.633
Family--hi!
- Hi!

20:49.667 --> 20:51.633
- Hello!
- Girlfriend circle!

20:51.667 --> 20:53.000
- You look so cute.

20:53.033 --> 20:54.367
- We were just talking
to Ariana

20:54.400 --> 20:56.233
that we want to do a--

20:56.266 --> 20:57.767
a girls' night
tomorrow night.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.433
- Like, old Hollywood-themed.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.433
Like, a nice dinner and drinks.

21:01.467 --> 21:04.500
- There'll be, like,
four of us, plus Kristen.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.767
- I have a feeling
that Scheana will be...

21:07.000 --> 21:09.066
- No, I'm for that.
- Disappointed to not be...

21:09.100 --> 21:10.500
included.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.734
- Um, we don't hang out
with Scheana.

21:12.767 --> 21:14.300
Like, you know,
I don't hate her.

21:14.333 --> 21:15.633
I'm not mad at her,
but, like,

21:15.667 --> 21:18.333
I am just doing
a lot of work on myself

21:18.367 --> 21:19.700
in the last year,
so it just feels like

21:19.734 --> 21:21.500
I'd be backsliding

21:21.533 --> 21:23.333
into a place
that I don't want to go.

21:23.367 --> 21:25.000
- I mean, to be honest,
I don't really see her

21:25.033 --> 21:26.500
as much as I used to.

21:26.533 --> 21:28.533
I mean, Scheana and I
are friends,

21:28.567 --> 21:29.633
but we haven't really

21:29.667 --> 21:31.000
hung out a whole lot.

21:31.033 --> 21:32.400
There she is.

21:32.433 --> 21:33.433
- Hi, hi.
- Look at your tiny

21:33.467 --> 21:34.600
little body.

21:34.633 --> 21:36.467
So I'm friends
with these girls,

21:36.500 --> 21:38.033
and we're gonna go out,

21:38.066 --> 21:40.066
and we're gonna have fun,
and if she's not invited,

21:40.100 --> 21:42.000
then that's up to her
to work out with them.

21:42.033 --> 21:44.066
She's a big girl.
I'm sure she can handle it.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.600
- We're not being assholes.

21:45.633 --> 21:47.734
This isn't us being like,
"Let's leave Scheana out."

21:47.767 --> 21:50.266
- No, we're not.
- And we had tried so hard,

21:50.300 --> 21:52.367
and this is all on her.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.467
I'm from Kentucky,

22:12.500 --> 22:14.333
and we make--
it's called beer cheese,

22:14.367 --> 22:15.633
and it's like a cheese spread.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.467
We use, like,
a sharp cheddar,

Okay.

a beer cheese company

22:30.100 --> 22:32.066
It's gonna be called
Mamaw's Beer Cheese.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.300
- Have a seat.
I'll bring it out.

22:33.333 --> 22:34.700
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

22:34.734 --> 22:36.300
- Beer cheese is

22:36.333 --> 22:37.567
a beer cheese spread.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.467
It has cheese,
it has other spices,

22:39.500 --> 22:41.333
and it has actual beer in it.

22:41.367 --> 22:42.700
Do you want to get
a beer cheese platter?

22:42.734 --> 22:44.400
- We sure can.
- We love some beer cheese.

22:44.433 --> 22:45.567
That's my favorite.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.100
- I grew up on this stuff.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.700
My Mamaw has made it
my entire life,

22:49.734 --> 22:51.300
and it's just delicious.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.633
I can't wait to bring it to LA.

22:52.667 --> 22:54.400
- Are we gonna make this
tomorrow?

22:54.433 --> 22:55.734
- Yeah, I wanna--
I just want to start doing

22:55.767 --> 22:58.000
some test batches,
just experiment.

22:58.033 --> 22:59.133
I told Mamaw.
I was like, "We're gonna

22:59.166 --> 23:00.433
put you on the map, Mamaw."

23:01.567 --> 23:02.700
- I think this is a great idea.

23:02.734 --> 23:03.767
I mean, who doesn't
love cheese?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.533
- Hey, guys.
- Yay.

23:05.567 --> 23:07.100
- We've got a spread key here.

23:07.133 --> 23:08.633
Most of these on here
are gonna be domestic,

23:08.667 --> 23:10.166
just because you said
you're from Kentucky,

23:10.200 --> 23:12.133
so we're gonna do--
keep that American vibe.

23:12.166 --> 23:13.133
- Awesome.
- All right.

23:13.166 --> 23:14.400
- Cheers.

23:14.433 --> 23:15.667
- Oh.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.000
Cheers.
- Cheers to our business.

23:17.033 --> 23:18.467
- Mm-hm.

23:18.500 --> 23:19.700
I like that one.
- Do you want

23:19.734 --> 23:21.400
to buy some cheese today?
- Mm-hm.

23:21.433 --> 23:22.600
- By the way,
I have my job back.

23:22.633 --> 23:24.133

why, yeah.

23:24.166 --> 23:25.600
What did Peter say?

23:25.633 --> 23:27.033
- He was just, like, you know,
"Lisa said

23:27.066 --> 23:28.467
you did a good job
at Gay Pride."

23:28.500 --> 23:29.734
It was fun, being back.
I like it there.

23:29.767 --> 23:31.166
You know, it's not just
a job to me,

23:31.200 --> 23:32.600
and I get to be with you,

23:32.633 --> 23:33.633

23:33.667 --> 23:35.767
- Now that you're

23:36.000 --> 23:37.367
- My "fee-ans."

23:40.000 --> 23:41.467

23:42.667 --> 23:44.066
what do you have
going on tonight?

23:44.100 --> 23:45.500
- I'm just doing, like,
a girls' night.

23:45.533 --> 23:46.667
We're just doing, like,
old Hollywood glam,

23:46.700 --> 23:48.567
and, like, pretty dresses,
and--

23:48.600 --> 23:50.000
- I think I'm gonna hang out
with the guys tonight, too.

23:50.033 --> 23:51.066
Did you have a good time
last night?

23:51.100 --> 23:52.400
- Yeah, I did.
I just, like--

23:52.433 --> 23:53.734
Scheana was telling me
about everything

23:53.767 --> 23:56.033
that--with James and Raquel,
of course,

23:56.066 --> 23:57.600
so it makes me
really sad for her,

23:57.633 --> 23:59.033
'cause I know she doesn't
believe anything, either.

23:59.066 --> 24:00.600
- It's the perfect girlfriend
for him,

24:00.633 --> 24:01.700
'cause he can get away
with whatever he wants,

24:01.734 --> 24:03.100
and she'll buy it.

24:03.133 --> 24:05.100
She just looks really dumb.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.633
- James is never gonna--
going to come out

24:06.667 --> 24:08.033
and admit it.
Like, at least whenever--

24:08.066 --> 24:09.500
I hate--I don't--
I'm not comparing it

24:09.533 --> 24:11.133
to us at all, because it was
a one-time thing,

24:11.166 --> 24:12.633
but it's just like, at least,
like, you told me the truth,

24:12.667 --> 24:14.433
and I feel like James
would never do that.

24:14.467 --> 24:15.633
You know what I mean?

24:15.667 --> 24:17.133
- That and the constant
apologies...

24:17.166 --> 24:18.633
- Like, I don't think
he would ever come out

24:18.667 --> 24:19.667
and tell her the truth.
- All the time.

24:19.700 --> 24:20.734
- And like, he uses "sorry"

24:20.767 --> 24:21.734
like it's just another word.

24:21.767 --> 24:23.133
- I feel so bad for her.

24:23.166 --> 24:24.200

what it feels like

24:24.233 --> 24:25.433

24:25.467 --> 24:26.767

24:27.000 --> 24:28.467
you know, questioning
your relationship.

24:28.500 --> 24:30.500
- You've chosen
the one man

24:30.533 --> 24:32.533
that every single one of us

24:32.567 --> 24:34.200
thinks is the worst man.

24:34.233 --> 24:35.567
- Don't make me get emotional.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.233
- What if you're wasting
your best years?

24:38.266 --> 24:40.033
- I just really
don't want Raquel

24:40.066 --> 24:41.400
to have to go
through this alone.

24:41.433 --> 24:43.667
I was gonna tell her
that we're going out

24:43.700 --> 24:45.000
for the girls' night,
and then say

24:45.033 --> 24:46.166
that she can come
if she wants to.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.533
I want to make sure
that she knows

24:47.567 --> 24:49.133
that she can be strong
and like, stand up

24:49.166 --> 24:51.000
whenever he is doing
those horrible things,

24:51.033 --> 24:52.500
because I feel
like she just gets scared,

24:52.533 --> 24:53.700
and, like,
doesn't say anything.

24:53.734 --> 24:55.000
She needs to stand up
and, like,

24:55.033 --> 24:56.500
be like, "He can't do that."

24:56.533 --> 24:58.200
I don't get it.

24:58.233 --> 24:59.667

hates your boyfriend?

can't go anywhere

25:01.200 --> 25:02.700

to kick your ass.

- I really feel sorry for her.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.100
I honestly do.
I mean, maybe she's just got

25:06.133 --> 25:08.000
a big heart and sees
the good in him, kind of.

25:08.033 --> 25:09.567

Is he gonna say it

his DJ crap,
