[male reporter on radio]
Traffic is

00:07.717 --> 00:09.218
backing up the Cahuenga Pass
all the way to Lankershim.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.803
It looks like your accident
is going to be

00:10.886 --> 00:12.805
right around
Hollywood Boulevard,

00:12.888 --> 00:15.516
an injury crash with
an overturned delivery van

00:15.599 --> 00:18.644
blocking the right lane,
so try to avoid the area.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.398
[female reporter] You're
listening to KNX 1070 News Radio

00:22.481 --> 00:25.151
with traffic reports
every ten minutes.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.736
We have breaking news
this morning

00:26.819 --> 00:28.738
from the Los Angeles
Police Commission

00:28.821 --> 00:31.115
where Pete Demetriou
is reporting.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.575
[Demetriou] That's right.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.243
With short notice
to the media and public,

00:34.326 --> 00:36.328
the police commission is meeting
in special session this morning

00:36.412 --> 00:38.372
to consider a measure
that would give

00:38.456 --> 00:40.374
Chief Irvin Irving
a second term.

00:40.458 --> 00:42.418
With more than a year
still to go in his first term,

00:42.501 --> 00:43.836
this morning's vote could mean

00:43.919 --> 00:45.588
another five-year term
for the chief

00:45.629 --> 00:47.923
or a vote of no confidence
and an early exit.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.759
This story is still developing

00:49.842 --> 00:51.469
- and we'll bring
the decision to you
- [engine starts]

00:51.552 --> 00:52.887
as soon as
the votes are counted.

00:52.970 --> 00:54.722
Live in Downtown L.A.,
Pete Demetriou...

00:59.059 --> 01:00.227
[Bosch] Jesus.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.772
Looks like something horrible
happened here.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.273
Smells like it, too.

01:04.356 --> 01:05.775
Yeah, I bought my snitch
a late-night burrito.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.860
I see he returned the favor.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.154
[scoffs] In Technicolor.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.072
So this phone call you got
last night-- who'd you talk to?

01:12.156 --> 01:14.325
Agent Nidi from
the joint gang task force.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.953
Lay off Las Palmas.
Keep away from El Cholo.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.206
Why El Cholo?

01:20.289 --> 01:21.749
Las Palmas has
their big sit-downs there.

01:21.832 --> 01:22.792
They get a private room.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.835
Nidi said LAPD?

01:24.919 --> 01:26.170
From the very top.

01:27.505 --> 01:29.507
- In cahoots with the Bureau.
- Yeah.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.966
Smells like it to me.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.885
Smells like what you got
right there, brother.

01:32.968 --> 01:34.428
[chuckles]

01:34.512 --> 01:36.347
Light a candle, Collins.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.142
That smell? Never goes away.

01:40.226 --> 01:42.228
Thanks for the tip.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.650
Two for, two against.

01:47.733 --> 01:48.943
Mr. Delgado?

01:52.780 --> 01:53.989
Aye.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.076
[woman] The vote is
three to two.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.410
The measure passes.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.412
Congratulations, Chief.

02:00.496 --> 02:01.580
Thank you.

02:03.541 --> 02:07.294
I look forward to continuing
my service to this great city

02:07.378 --> 02:08.671
and instituting reforms

02:08.754 --> 02:10.339
that will lead to
more effective crime suppression

02:10.422 --> 02:12.424
and better community relations.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.801
And with that,

02:13.884 --> 02:16.470
we adjourn this special meeting
of the commission.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.515
[quiet chatter]

02:24.061 --> 02:25.563
[female reporter] Thank you
for that.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.606
Let's go back to Pete Demetriou
in Downtown L.A.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.024
with breaking news.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.609
[Demetriou] The L.A.
Police Commission

02:30.693 --> 02:33.904
has voted Chief Irvin Irving
a second five-year term.

02:33.988 --> 02:35.739
Former Deputy Chief
Nestor Delgado

02:35.823 --> 02:37.867
cast the deciding vote
in Irving's favor.

02:37.950 --> 02:39.201
Live in Downtown L.A.,

02:39.285 --> 02:41.871
Pete Demetriou,
KNX 1070 News Radio.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.963
[Edgar] Harry.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.303
Irving just got re-upped.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.098
I don't even know
what that means.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.600
Police commission.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.518
They just gave him
another five years.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.186
What the fuck?

03:06.270 --> 03:08.355
And Delgado voted for him.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.940
What do you think it means?

03:10.024 --> 03:12.067
Above my pay grade.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.862
But I know how it looks.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.822
Looks like the fix is in.

I don't like lawyers.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.895
What those bastards did to you?

04:29.979 --> 04:31.981
The city and the department
would pay big bucks

04:32.064 --> 04:34.483
just to keep it
out of the media.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.070
You could retire.
We could travel.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.532
Hey, if you want to travel,
take a fucking trip.

04:43.826 --> 04:45.828
I just want you to get
what you deserve.

04:46.829 --> 04:49.957
I have a career,
and I would like to keep it.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.546
If I sue the department,
I am dead in the department.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.924
That is what this whole thing
was about: power.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.718
And now that I have some,

05:00.801 --> 05:04.888
I am going to use it
to get everything I can,

05:04.972 --> 05:07.391
- in the department.
- I just think that if you...

05:07.474 --> 05:09.935
I am done with
this conversation.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.981
[Kent Shocknek] LAX is
one of three U.S. airports

05:14.064 --> 05:16.275
where CDC staffers
are checking passengers

05:16.358 --> 05:18.402
arriving from Wuhan, China,

05:18.485 --> 05:20.529
for symptoms of
a mysterious new virus

05:20.612 --> 05:22.031
that's killed two
and infected dozens.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.116
- Great. All we need.
- What, babe?

05:24.199 --> 05:26.410
- Nothing.
- Not since the Ebola outbreak,

05:26.493 --> 05:28.912
six years ago,
has the CDC done...

05:30.205 --> 05:32.332
The world's going to hell.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.376
What else is new?

05:34.460 --> 05:36.462
What are you looking at?

05:38.505 --> 05:40.591
The LAPD application portal.

05:42.051 --> 05:43.677
No way.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.388
Are you serious?

05:47.890 --> 05:49.892
I don't know.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.978
Maybe.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.565
It's just...

05:56.648 --> 05:59.651
you all do something
that matters.

05:59.735 --> 06:03.113
- What am I doing with my life?
- You keep saying that.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.949
I know.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.368
Sorry. You must be
tired of hearing it.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.667
You'll find something.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.296
It'll come to you.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.424
That's easy for you to say.
You know your path.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.181
And I have to take it right now.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.519
I'll see you tonight?

06:33.602 --> 06:35.604
- Talk then.
- Sure.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.818
No, I'm sorry. [sighs]

06:40.901 --> 06:43.529
Let's let cooler heads
prevail, okay?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.700
Come in. Listen, I've got to go.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.286
Um, let's talk tonight?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.122
Yeah, uh, make a reservation.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.583
Wherever you want.

06:56.667 --> 06:58.669
All right. Bye.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.463
- [sighs]
- Hear about Irving?

07:01.547 --> 07:05.759
I guess I was reading the
city hall tea leaves all wrong.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.761
You and everybody else.
What do you think it means?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.721
I have no idea, Harry.

07:09.805 --> 07:11.807
I am just keeping my head down.

07:12.808 --> 07:15.435
- Homicide transfers set yet?
- Almost.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.479
Just waiting for O'Brien to make
up his mind about who he wants

07:17.563 --> 07:21.024
at West Bureau, but I don't
think you have to worry.

07:21.108 --> 07:24.278
- Can I make a suggestion?
- I will pass it along.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.785
[Reece] You are
a dog with a bone.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.495
[Bosch] Something's about
to go down with Peña.

07:33.579 --> 07:34.705
Bureau's in the thick of it.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.123
I need to know
the what and when.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.041
I told you I tried.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.918
All right?
Got as far as I could.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.754
Peña as good as
lit the match on that fire.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.464
They're gonna let him walk.

07:44.548 --> 07:47.467
Set him up with a new name
in a new place.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.677
Let him go legit.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.429
Sonia Hernandez, her mother

07:50.512 --> 07:52.931
and the three other victims
are in the ground, forever.

07:56.810 --> 08:00.230
Some kind of big meeting's
about to go down.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.691
- And they brought in CIT.
- Critical Incident Team?

08:05.903 --> 08:08.322
I thought they were only brought
in in mass casualty events.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.325
Or mass arrests.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.337
[inhales deeply]

08:38.268 --> 08:39.895
[horn honks]

08:50.489 --> 08:54.117
Nice of the Times to let us
use the cafeteria.

08:54.201 --> 08:57.246
Coffee sucks, but it's better
than what's brewing over at RHD.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.539
[chuckles] Detective Bosch,
what can I do for you?

08:59.623 --> 09:01.833
Read your online account
about the chief

09:01.917 --> 09:03.877
getting a second term
this morning.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.338
Yeah? What about it?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.298
Seemed kind of like
the coffee here.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.926
- Weak, tepid.
- [chuckles]

09:11.009 --> 09:13.470
I had to post something
before I got scooped.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.764
But don't worry,
there's more coming.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.516
Yeah? Like what?

09:17.599 --> 09:20.519
Bosch, why would I tell you
before I post it?

09:20.602 --> 09:22.896
I work for the paper, not you.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.190
'Cause I kind of figured
you'd like me to owe you one.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.571
[sighs]

09:33.907 --> 09:35.033
[clears throat]

09:35.117 --> 09:36.368
I'm running down a rumor

09:36.410 --> 09:38.245
that, in exchange
for the extension,

09:38.328 --> 09:40.580
Irving squelched
a possible investigation

09:40.664 --> 09:42.541
into the mayor's campaign.

09:42.624 --> 09:44.584
Misuse of funds.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.005
So he strong-armed the mayor.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.258
And the mayor leans on Delgado
to change his vote.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.594
It's a beautiful thing.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.805
And now you owe me one.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.349
Old news.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.268
It was in your paper
during the campaign.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.312
Feds looked into it,
filed no charges.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.564
Uh, doesn't mean
they didn't find anything.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.482
It just means
they didn't make a case.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.444
So there's a file.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.530
- Have you seen it?
- No.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.866
But I'll bet you Irving has.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.788
So Irving gets ahold
of the FBI file,

10:21.872 --> 10:24.916
threatens to reopen the
investigation as a state case,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.585
uses that to pressure the mayor.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.588
So the question is:

10:29.671 --> 10:34.176
What did Irving give the FBI
in return for the file?

10:34.259 --> 10:38.180
Was there a quid pro quo
with the Feds?

10:38.263 --> 10:40.807
- There's always a quid pro quo.
- [chuckles]

10:42.142 --> 10:44.603
[quiet chatter]

10:44.686 --> 10:46.688
[phone ringing in distance]

10:53.236 --> 10:55.113
Congratulations, Chief.

11:04.456 --> 11:07.167
- Chief.
- Lieutenant.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.922
I hear congratulations
are in order.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.673
Thank you.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.095
So, what can I do
for you, Chief?

11:23.225 --> 11:26.436
Just checking to see how
you're doing after the, uh...

11:26.520 --> 11:29.439
unpleasant business with Captain
Cooper and the other officers.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.568
Well, my partner thinks
that I should hire a lawyer

11:33.652 --> 11:36.154
and go after Cooper
and the department in court.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.948
And what did you say
to your partner?

11:38.031 --> 11:40.450
I said I would think about it,

11:40.534 --> 11:42.494
but that the department
is my home.

11:42.577 --> 11:46.623
I'd like to wait and see
what happens first.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.543
See if changes are made.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.003
And whether I would be
in a position

11:52.087 --> 11:54.673
to see that those changes
are implemented.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.428
You know,

11:59.511 --> 12:02.514
I need someone
to fill Cooper's spot.

12:02.597 --> 12:04.182
I'd like it to be you.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.562
I've done
the acting captain thing before.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.564
Doing the job without
the bar on the collar.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.525
This would be a step toward
a permanent assignment.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.947
We both know that I didn't
exactly ace the orals.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.658
I don't think that'll be
a problem this time.

12:21.741 --> 12:26.329
You've shown yourself to be
a remarkable team player...

12:26.413 --> 12:27.539
Captain.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.879
Well, Chief, I don't know
what to say.

12:34.921 --> 12:37.466
I think you'll find that
this promotion will be only

12:37.549 --> 12:40.093
a brief stop in your steady
rise in the department.

12:40.177 --> 12:42.429
Thank you, sir.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.809
Keep this on the down low

12:47.893 --> 12:49.936
until I make the announcement
next week.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.063
Yes, sir.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.235
[door opens]

12:57.319 --> 12:59.279
[door closes]

13:00.113 --> 13:02.616
[exhales slowly]

13:05.327 --> 13:06.661
Sonia Hernandez.

13:09.247 --> 13:10.207
What?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.083
East Hollywood fire.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.543
Little girl.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.420
Her name was Sonia Hernandez.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.840
I know who she is.
What about her?

13:18.924 --> 13:21.426
I know what you did.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.929
Excuse me?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.430
I know you made a deal
with the Feds.

13:25.514 --> 13:27.974
We lay off Peña, you get what
you need to keep your job.

13:28.058 --> 13:31.686
You don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

13:31.770 --> 13:33.438
I know this department
doesn't give a fuck about Sonia,

13:33.522 --> 13:34.773
her mother or the other victims.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.359
You got the killers, Bosch,
and that is justice

13:37.442 --> 13:38.985
for Sonia Hernandez
and the others.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.820
That's not justice
when Mickey Peña walks away.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.531
Hard decisions had to be made.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.241
The best outcome
has been achieved.

13:45.283 --> 13:47.452
You mean for you, right?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.164
Long as you get your
five years tacked on,

13:51.248 --> 13:54.376
all good and bright
in the City of Angels.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.460
Fuck you.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.551
That's your last free one,
Bosch.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.178
[engine starts]

14:07.806 --> 14:10.475
- [door closes]
- Nothing's ever free.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.519
[vehicle drives off]

14:13.728 --> 14:15.021
There are several steps.

14:15.105 --> 14:16.815
You'll have an initial
interview, which will be

14:16.898 --> 14:18.942
evaluated along with
your application.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.569
At that point, you will be
notified by e-mail

14:20.652 --> 14:22.821
if you've been chosen to begin
the full application process.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.447
I understand.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.158
Every applicant is assigned
an LAPD mentor.

14:27.242 --> 14:29.160
As your mentor, I'm gonna
guide you through the process

14:29.244 --> 14:32.330
- and answer any questions
you might have.
- Okay.

14:34.207 --> 14:37.711
- You're a legacy candidate.
- Yes. My father.

14:37.794 --> 14:38.837
Hollywood Homicide.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.923
For now. It's gonna be
disbanded soon,

14:42.007 --> 14:43.967
so he's not sure
where he'll end up.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.763
Tell me why you want to be
a police officer.

14:53.727 --> 14:56.104
I want to do something
with my life.

14:58.607 --> 15:02.444
Something that makes
a difference.

15:02.527 --> 15:06.823
And I want to help people
when they need it the most.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.791
- Hey.
- S'up, homeboy?

15:16.875 --> 15:20.211
Long time no see.
Sorry I'm late.

15:20.295 --> 15:25.091
What's, uh... What is up
with the spycraft?

15:25.175 --> 15:27.802
I just wanted to see if either
of us picked up a tail.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.638
Oh, you told me
to keep it confidential,

15:29.721 --> 15:32.182
I kept it confidential.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.683
How are things at CIT?

15:33.767 --> 15:37.228
Oh, staying busy, like always.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.105
W-Why am I here, Bosch?

15:39.189 --> 15:41.858
CIT's covering a Las Palmas 13
summit,

15:41.941 --> 15:44.694
- and I want to be there.
- Who told you that?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.905
My guess is it's at El Cholo.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.657
All I need from you
is day and time.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.158
You didn't answer my question.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.785
It's a major RICO op.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.162
-They made a deal
with Mickey Peña.
-Who did?

15:54.245 --> 15:56.373
LAPD and the Bureau.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.708
You and your team are gonna
protect Peña

15:58.792 --> 16:00.919
when they take down the summit.

16:01.002 --> 16:01.961
He sets up this meeting,

16:02.045 --> 16:04.422
wears a wire,
testifies at trial,

16:04.506 --> 16:07.509
and they're gonna let him
fucking walk on five murders,

16:07.592 --> 16:09.844
including a ten-year-old girl.

16:10.762 --> 16:11.888
The East Hollywood fire?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.598
Yeah, I heard they made
arrests on that.

16:13.682 --> 16:14.849
Foot soldiers.

16:14.933 --> 16:17.936
- Peña ordered it done.
- You have the evidence?

16:19.104 --> 16:20.313
I have a co-conspirator.

16:20.397 --> 16:21.773
It's enough to charge him,

16:21.856 --> 16:24.901
-if I can get to him.
-Mm.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.653
I need your help.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.240
Time and location.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.533
I scoop Peña after the meeting.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.327
FBI gets their case,
and I get mine.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.745
No, it's not our investigation.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.955
I don't know all the details
of your case...

16:37.038 --> 16:39.124
What other details do you need?

16:39.207 --> 16:43.628
A ten-year-old girl died,
alone, calling for her mother.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.213
The Bureau's gonna let
Peña fuckin' walk

16:45.296 --> 16:47.507
because he's setting up
gangbanger narcos

16:47.590 --> 16:49.300
and prison bosses.

16:49.384 --> 16:51.386
In what world is that the better
choice or the greater good?

16:53.430 --> 16:54.639
It's not my case.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.100
I know. It's mine.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.604
I'm counting on you
to do the right thing.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.826
- [indistinct chatter]
- [phone rings]

17:28.631 --> 17:30.592
- Juan.
- Jefe.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.553
Buenos noches, Juan.

17:33.636 --> 17:35.555
Have a great night, Lieutenant.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.563
She's gone.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.209
[Pierce] PM Watch. You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.753
Hey, you got the late show.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.379
Midnight shift detective.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.131
Oh, the places you'll go.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.092
Old days, we would have called
that the graveyard shift.

18:13.176 --> 18:15.428
Fuck me.
I can't believe this.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.013
[chuckles]

18:25.063 --> 18:27.065
[Mankiewicz] He'll be all right.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.614
Harry.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.658
- Yeah?
- What the fuck?

18:36.741 --> 18:39.285
How'd you get West Bureau
and I get RHD?

18:39.369 --> 18:41.204
That makes no sense.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.498
It makes perfect sense.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.250
You're gonna kick
some serious ass down there.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.461
Did you have something
to do with this?

18:49.921 --> 18:51.840
You overestimate my powers
of persuasion.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.760
Everybody going to Musso's?

19:00.765 --> 19:03.268
No, seriously,
you're gonna love it, kid, okay.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.770
You get to handle everything
that comes up, right?

19:05.854 --> 19:09.107
I mean, everything
from homicides to homeless

19:09.190 --> 19:10.733
taking a dump
in somebody's backyard.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.863
I don't think you're helping
sell the situation.

19:14.946 --> 19:19.534
Hey, I met my first wife
on the late show.

19:20.410 --> 19:24.247
Domestic disturbance,
I roll up, she's buck naked.

19:24.330 --> 19:27.584
She's got a guy in a headlock
for trying to backdoor her.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.460
[laughter]

19:29.544 --> 19:32.380
Domestic disturbance
to domestic bliss.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.007
Only on the night watch.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.217
That one didn't last too long.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.760
Did any of 'em?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.054
- I had a pretty good run
on number three.
- Mm.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.681
Or-or was it four?

19:41.764 --> 19:44.767
Uh, you've only been
married three...

19:44.851 --> 19:46.895
No, no, no, I'm counting
common law.

19:46.978 --> 19:51.024
I mean, he's Harry Bosch.
It's intimidating.

19:51.107 --> 19:52.901
I don't know how you two
lasted so long.

19:52.984 --> 19:56.487
Well...

19:56.571 --> 19:59.949
Harry's Harry.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.076
There's no better partner.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.369
You'll be fine.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.288
I wish it was you, Jerry.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.041
We'd have made a good team.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.670
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.258
Cheer up, youngblood.

20:17.342 --> 20:20.345
Let me buy you a martini.
Musso's is famous for 'em.

20:20.428 --> 20:24.474
Would you be happy going
from Homicide to the late show?

20:24.557 --> 20:26.517
I'd be miserable.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.895
Things change.
Just have to hold fast.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.023
That's easy for you to say.

20:32.106 --> 20:34.943
You're going to West Bureau
with Vega.

20:35.026 --> 20:38.237
Grey Goose up, no olives.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.281
No olives means more alcohol
in the glass.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.491
That's the plan.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.909
Put it on my tab.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.412
Thanks.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.667
You're gonna be all right.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.976
- [Mankiewicz] Hey.
- [Maddie] Hey.

21:08.059 --> 21:10.269
- How are you?
- How are you?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.438
- Have you seen my dad?
- Ah.
- Yeah.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.190
- End of the bar.
- Okay.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.612
- Hey, Maddie.
- Hi, Rondell.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.657
- Uh, take my seat.
- Are you sure?

21:22.740 --> 21:24.075
Absolutely.

21:26.828 --> 21:27.954
Glad you could make it.

21:28.037 --> 21:29.872
- Of course.
- Antonio?

21:29.956 --> 21:31.958
Working.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.836
- How do you feel about
West Bureau?
- Same job,

21:34.919 --> 21:36.879
different desk.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.090
- Longer commute.
- True.

21:41.551 --> 21:43.386
Dad, I have something
to tell you.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.014
You're getting married?

21:46.097 --> 21:47.015
No.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.808
Whew.

21:48.891 --> 21:51.769
Okay...

21:51.853 --> 21:53.062
hit me.

21:54.814 --> 21:58.359
You may get a call
asking you to vouch

21:58.443 --> 22:00.611
for an applicant
to the police department.

22:00.695 --> 22:02.989
Sure. Who?

22:04.032 --> 22:06.451
Um...

22:06.534 --> 22:07.785
me.

22:10.663 --> 22:11.873
You applied?

22:11.956 --> 22:14.625
I did.

22:14.709 --> 22:16.502
And I already went down
and met with my mentor,

22:16.586 --> 22:18.963
so they'll probably call you.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.759
Mads, you sure?

22:22.842 --> 22:24.719
We've never really talked
about this.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.806
No, we didn't.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.641
Because it's my choice.

22:30.725 --> 22:32.602
And yes, I'm sure.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.488
[Maddie exhales heavily]

22:43.571 --> 22:45.698
I really thought
you'd be happy for me.

22:47.658 --> 22:48.910
You'd be proud.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.537
I am. It... caught me off guard.

22:56.250 --> 22:58.169
You know, the guy who
interviewed me said

22:58.252 --> 23:00.463
that since I'm a legacy,
I'll get to take my first shift

23:00.546 --> 23:02.840
after the academy with you.

23:02.924 --> 23:06.844
- Won't that be cool?
- Very cool.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.270
Want to get a table
and have some dinner?

23:16.354 --> 23:20.733
- I'm starved
and it's chicken potpie night.
- Sure, let's do it.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.152
- So you will give me
a good rec?
- No.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.154
- Okay.
- Of course I will.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.408
Mads...

23:29.492 --> 23:32.411
I am proud of you.

23:32.495 --> 23:36.207
Always. Always.

23:39.293 --> 23:42.255
- [horn honks in distance]
- [police siren wails faintly]

23:43.840 --> 23:45.800
[Edgar] That's good to hear.
Thank you.

23:47.051 --> 23:50.471
- Who was that?
- The uni on Money Chandler's
room.

23:50.555 --> 23:51.722
She's coming out of the coma.

23:51.806 --> 23:53.724
Moved her from critical
to serious.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.018
That's good news.
I should call Maddie.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.728
That looks like
a filing package.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.564
- It is.
- Who?

23:59.647 --> 24:02.233
Miguel "Mickey" Peña,
five counts of murder.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.068
[sighs]

24:06.028 --> 24:08.573
Okay, partner, let's go outside.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.951
Harry, now.

24:25.840 --> 24:27.466
I know what you're doing.

24:29.468 --> 24:30.887
What am I doing?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.556
Committing career suicide.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.225
I'm doing what's right.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.144
Sometimes
it's the same thing, Harry.

24:39.353 --> 24:40.688
We were told to lay off Peña.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.857
The D.A.'s not touching this.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.775
You take this package
down there, it's only gonna lead

24:44.859 --> 24:47.612
the D.A. and Irving
down on us like an avalanche.

24:47.695 --> 24:48.863
Tell me you don't see that.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.240
I see it.
Fuck am I supposed to do?

24:51.324 --> 24:53.659
- Walk away? I can't do that.
- I get that.

24:53.743 --> 24:57.038
But what you're doing
is an exercise in futility.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.956
The Bureau's got Peña,
they're not gonna let him go.

24:59.040 --> 25:01.459
They're using him to stage
