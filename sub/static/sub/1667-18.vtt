00:00.130 --> 00:01.776
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.777 --> 00:03.984
Dahlia is the most power
witch I've ever seen.

00:03.985 --> 00:05.477
She craves more power still,

00:05.479 --> 00:07.081
and that is why
she will come here...

00:07.082 --> 00:09.294
To take the child's
power for herself.

00:09.295 --> 00:10.462
You haven't gotten
any sleep lately?

00:10.463 --> 00:12.548
I've been here studying all
this stuff since Kol died.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.487
The wolves need a new leader.

00:14.489 --> 00:18.764
I can help you become
the leader your pack deserves.

00:18.766 --> 00:20.636
You want to call things off
because it'd look weird

00:20.637 --> 00:22.940
for a werewolf VP
to be dating me.

00:22.941 --> 00:24.241
I'm just trying
to keep you safe.

00:24.243 --> 00:26.183
Freya: Dahlia has
the power to kill

00:26.184 --> 00:28.023
anyone who stands in her way.

00:28.025 --> 00:29.602
And you know how to stop her.

00:29.603 --> 00:32.673
Given the proper materials, yes.

00:32.674 --> 00:34.244
I've sent father
to procure them.

00:34.245 --> 00:37.550
You put the life of my child
in the hands of Mikael.

00:37.551 --> 00:39.524
Nothing will happen
to that child,

00:39.525 --> 00:40.996
but we have to consider
every weapon

00:40.997 --> 00:42.373
at our disposal, brother.

00:42.374 --> 00:44.776
Dahlia is coming.

00:45.550 --> 00:46.683
[Fussing]

00:46.684 --> 00:48.019
Hey, hey, hey.

00:48.020 --> 00:50.458
Well, Mrs. Marshall-Kenner,

00:50.459 --> 00:53.165
now that you've got a real local
to show you around the quarter,

00:53.166 --> 00:55.107
where would you like to start?

00:55.108 --> 00:58.588
Well, Mr. Kenner, I'd ask
to see your old haunts,

00:58.589 --> 01:02.862
but we do have an impressionable,
young lady with us.

01:02.863 --> 01:07.044
Come on.
Look. Ha ha!

01:07.045 --> 01:09.917
[Playing jaunty tune]

01:13.745 --> 01:16.936
Thanks.

01:17.941 --> 01:21.347
[Playing haunting melody]

01:25.021 --> 01:28.225
That song. What is it?

01:45.500 --> 01:48.876
Flowers, miss.
A gift for the child.

01:48.877 --> 01:50.614
No. We're all right.
Thank you.

01:50.616 --> 01:52.386
You sure?

01:52.387 --> 01:54.555
Black dahlias are in bloom.

01:54.556 --> 01:56.590
They're quite lovely.

01:58.831 --> 02:01.235
Show yourself, witch.

02:01.236 --> 02:03.906
[Hope fusses]

02:04.742 --> 02:05.743
Klaus!

02:05.744 --> 02:06.945
I am here.

02:06.946 --> 02:11.524
I am everywhere, and I intend
to take what is mine.

02:11.525 --> 02:13.095
It's her.

02:13.096 --> 02:15.434
[Exhales]

02:15.435 --> 02:16.835
Hey, what just happened?

02:18.171 --> 02:19.776
Dahlia.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.319
Klaus: Isn't
that the point of a fortress?

02:24.320 --> 02:25.658
It does a better job
of protecting you

02:25.659 --> 02:26.962
when you stay within its walls.

02:26.963 --> 02:28.798
Ok. We get it.

02:28.799 --> 02:30.568
Now let's just figure out
what the hell we're gonna do.

02:30.569 --> 02:32.672
What I would like to do
is take a strong leash...

02:32.673 --> 02:34.475
Children, please.

02:34.476 --> 02:36.146
Niklaus, your ire is justified.

02:36.147 --> 02:38.018
However, Hayley is quite right.

02:38.019 --> 02:40.521
We need to find a new strategy.

02:40.522 --> 02:42.357
Freya, if you please...

02:44.195 --> 02:47.668
This spell you described,
Dahlia calls it kenning,

02:47.669 --> 02:50.538
using proxies to watch
her enemies from afar,

02:50.539 --> 02:52.809
but I've never seen it done

02:52.810 --> 02:55.315
on quite this scale.
Awesome.

02:55.316 --> 02:56.887
So basically,
every hurricane-chugging,

02:56.888 --> 03:00.360
boob-flashing tourist on Bourbon
Street is a potential spy.

03:00.361 --> 03:01.862
The good new is,
I know a little bit

03:01.863 --> 03:03.865
about how her magic works.

03:03.867 --> 03:07.773
This tonic will at least prevent
her from using any of us.

03:09.652 --> 03:11.716
Rebekah: Well, come on.

03:11.717 --> 03:14.416
Should work like a charm.

03:14.417 --> 03:17.181
Bottoms up.

03:19.753 --> 03:22.692
Niklaus, is there something
you wish to contribute?

03:22.693 --> 03:25.427
I prefer biscuits with my tea.

03:25.428 --> 03:26.559
Of course.

03:26.561 --> 03:28.729
Besides, our minds
are far too strong

03:28.730 --> 03:31.166
to be invaded by kenning spells.

03:31.167 --> 03:33.834
So what we experienced
was a test.

03:33.836 --> 03:37.635
Dahlia is watching to see
how we respond to aggression.

03:37.636 --> 03:39.838
She's preparing for battle.

03:39.839 --> 03:41.610
My guess is sooner
rather than later.

03:41.611 --> 03:43.079
Well, if she was watching us,

03:43.080 --> 03:44.680
she would know
that we have our own army.

03:44.681 --> 03:46.447
Elijah: She also knows
where we are,

03:46.448 --> 03:48.113
and, given the immense
nature of her power,

03:48.114 --> 03:50.616
we simply have no idea
what to expect from her.

03:50.617 --> 03:53.086
What we need is to create
a new stronghold,

03:53.088 --> 03:54.723
something that Dahlia
knows nothing about,

03:54.724 --> 03:57.656
a sanctuary from any witchcraft.

03:57.658 --> 04:00.561
That's a fine strategy.

04:00.562 --> 04:03.097
I offer another.

04:03.098 --> 04:06.701
We could use Jackson to trace
her magic back to its source,

04:06.702 --> 04:10.338
find out exactly where she is.

04:14.142 --> 04:16.545
Fine. Do it.

04:16.546 --> 04:17.879
Good. Then it's settled.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.615
Off you pop
to your respective tasks.

04:19.616 --> 04:20.950
Me, I've always been
of the opinion

04:20.952 --> 04:23.623
that the best defense
is a good offense.

04:23.624 --> 04:27.994
So I'm gonna find a way to
murder that God-forsaken witch.

04:43.413 --> 04:47.486
What do you want, Klaus?

04:47.487 --> 04:50.754
Well, perhaps I'm merely
concerned about you.

04:50.755 --> 04:52.756
You do seem to spend
an inordinate amount

04:52.757 --> 04:55.224
of time in graveyards
for a teenager.

04:55.226 --> 04:57.594
It's a rather morbid habit.

04:57.595 --> 05:00.064
Well, I am touched
by your concern.

05:00.065 --> 05:01.632
Anything else?

05:01.633 --> 05:04.468
Now that you mention it,
there is one matter

05:04.469 --> 05:07.371
with which I could
use your help...

05:07.372 --> 05:10.141
Mikael.

05:10.142 --> 05:13.675
It appears my sister
Freya has dispatched him

05:13.676 --> 05:15.343
to gather some items I require,

05:15.344 --> 05:16.974
and, seeing as how
you brought him back

05:16.975 --> 05:19.875
from the dead, I'm guessing you
have the means to find him.

05:19.877 --> 05:21.879
Sorry. I'd love to help,
but I'm a little busy

05:21.880 --> 05:24.649
mourning another dead boyfriend.

05:26.186 --> 05:31.357
Do you think you're
the only one who grieves my brother?

05:31.358 --> 05:34.726
I understand you hope
to bring Kol back.

05:34.727 --> 05:37.461
Resurrection spells
can be very tricky.

05:37.462 --> 05:41.463
Then tend to require a remnant
from the dearly departed.

05:41.464 --> 05:45.566
I, myself, am the guardian
of Kol's remains,

05:45.567 --> 05:47.968
the ashes of his true body.

05:47.969 --> 05:52.336
Now, I might be inclined
to entrust them to you

05:52.337 --> 05:57.744
were I, myself, feeling helpful.

05:57.745 --> 06:00.313
Fine. I'll find Mikael for you,

06:00.314 --> 06:02.213
and you'll give me Kol's ashes.

06:02.214 --> 06:04.715
Deal?

06:04.716 --> 06:08.151
Aiden: We should
probably get up now.

06:08.152 --> 06:12.450
Yeah. Yeah, definitely, 100%.

06:12.451 --> 06:14.887
So it's settled, then, huh?

06:14.888 --> 06:16.524
I'm basically
already out the door...

06:16.525 --> 06:18.095
Oh, yeah?

06:18.096 --> 06:22.361
Or we could stay in
bed all day long...

06:22.362 --> 06:23.560
Ooh.

06:23.561 --> 06:26.729
You know, with some Netflix,
Chinese food,

06:26.730 --> 06:28.198
probably some other stuff.

06:28.199 --> 06:29.534
Mm.

06:29.535 --> 06:31.904
[Cell phone vibrates]

06:31.905 --> 06:33.137
Mm...

06:33.138 --> 06:35.870
[Buzz]

06:35.871 --> 06:38.305
Oh, I should probably,
uh, get this.

06:38.306 --> 06:40.108
It's Jackson.
Yeah. Yeah.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.277
No. I got it.
Wolf business.

06:42.278 --> 06:43.712
I'm gonna grab a shower.

06:43.713 --> 06:46.814
[Buzz]

06:46.815 --> 06:50.118
[Buzz]

06:53.253 --> 06:55.550
[Beep] Yeah?

06:55.551 --> 06:57.450
Klaus, on phone: Aiden, it seems

06:57.451 --> 07:00.587
your big, bad alpha
has been compromised.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.390
What? What happened?

07:02.391 --> 07:04.825
Relax.
Jackson is fine.

07:04.826 --> 07:07.459
He's just offered further proof
of his general inadequacy.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.626
I can't trust him to guard hope.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.360
So while my hands
are full, I need you

07:11.361 --> 07:12.965
to serve as my eyes and ears.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.867
Get to the compound.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.102
Report back anything
I should know,

07:17.103 --> 07:19.405
especially where
my daughter is concerned.

07:19.406 --> 07:22.475
Yeah. Um, sure thing.
I'm on my way.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.846
Good lad.
[Beep]

07:25.847 --> 07:28.819
[Knock knock]

07:28.820 --> 07:31.924
Hey, you ok?

07:32.993 --> 07:35.630
That witch got in my head.

07:35.631 --> 07:39.801
I could've hurt you,
hurt the baby.

07:39.802 --> 07:42.270
Here. Drink this.

07:42.271 --> 07:47.142
Freya said it will keep her
from getting in again.

07:50.249 --> 07:52.350
I could feel her, Hayley.

07:52.351 --> 07:56.554
Dahlia, she's nothing
but darkness.

07:58.291 --> 08:02.799
I say we take hope and the pack
and we leave town tonight.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.201
We can't just run
from our home, Jack.

08:05.202 --> 08:08.134
You and hope are my home,

08:08.135 --> 08:10.435
and running isn't
a sign of weakness.

08:10.436 --> 08:12.436
It's what wolves do.

08:12.437 --> 08:14.206
I know every inch of that bayou.

08:14.207 --> 08:17.212
Out there, we're the predator.

08:17.213 --> 08:20.678
We can keep her safe.

08:20.679 --> 08:22.479
At the very least,
it'll buy us some time

08:22.480 --> 08:24.612
to figure out a way to get
rid of Dahlia for good.

08:24.613 --> 08:29.048
What about Klaus,
Elijah, Rebekah?

08:29.049 --> 08:30.682
They're hope's family.

08:30.683 --> 08:32.816
No. Do you know who else
is a part of that family?

08:32.818 --> 08:35.251
Dahlia.

08:35.253 --> 08:38.990
Look. I don't back
away from a fight, ok,

08:38.991 --> 08:42.561
but this one started
1,000 years ago.

08:42.562 --> 08:45.730
It's not our war...

08:47.868 --> 08:50.002
And it certainly
ain't your daughter's.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.172
So what's the deal, anyway?

08:58.173 --> 08:59.739
Aiden at your beck and call now?

08:59.740 --> 09:02.574
I'm simply mentoring
a promising, young wolf.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.309
Josh isn't gonna be too happy
when he finds out about it.

09:05.310 --> 09:07.847
And I am shaking in my boots

09:07.848 --> 09:10.148
at the mere thought
of his displeasure.

09:10.149 --> 09:13.254
You see, Davina, Josh
and Aiden are in love,

09:13.255 --> 09:15.592
which means they both
have something to lose,

09:15.594 --> 09:18.596
thus making them all
too easily manipulated

09:18.598 --> 09:21.898
should the need arise.

09:21.899 --> 09:26.701
It must really suck to have
to be you all the time.

09:26.702 --> 09:30.441
Well, it hasn't been
a picnic, honestly.

09:30.442 --> 09:35.076
You know, thing is, you have
that now, too, don't you,

09:35.077 --> 09:39.784
someone you love more
than anything, even yourself.

09:39.785 --> 09:42.754
How does that feel
to be one of us,

09:42.755 --> 09:46.454
someone with something to lose?

09:47.288 --> 09:48.990
Klaus, there.

09:58.066 --> 10:03.438
Well, well, well, well, if it
isn't the bastard himself.

10:03.439 --> 10:06.641
Have you come looking
for another beating, boy?

10:06.642 --> 10:09.479
As much as I'd love
to kill you again,

10:09.480 --> 10:11.513
I wonder if our interests
might be better served

10:11.514 --> 10:13.947
by joining forces.

10:13.948 --> 10:20.683
You know full well
the threat we face, so...

10:20.685 --> 10:23.253
How about it...

10:23.254 --> 10:25.054
Father?

10:25.055 --> 10:28.156
Care to join your bastard
son on a witch hunt?

10:39.468 --> 10:43.338
Oh, this was quite
the place back in my day,

10:43.339 --> 10:45.840
St. James infirmary...

10:45.841 --> 10:49.709
Vulgar, filthy, loud,

10:49.711 --> 10:53.780
some of the best
nights of my life,

10:53.781 --> 10:55.846
but I assume you
didn't go through

10:55.847 --> 10:57.749
all this trouble on my account.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.384
Marcel: As you know, for years,
this place served

10:59.385 --> 11:01.252
as neutral ground
for both our communities,

11:01.253 --> 11:04.422
a place where all
were welcome and safe.

11:04.423 --> 11:06.424
And, in keeping
with that tradition,

11:06.425 --> 11:08.759
we'd like to invite you
to cast a spell,

11:08.760 --> 11:10.760
one that would prevent the use

11:10.761 --> 11:13.063
of any magic within these walls.

11:13.065 --> 11:14.768
You'd ask me to create a place

11:14.769 --> 11:18.336
where my kind would be
utterly helpless?

11:18.337 --> 11:21.707
My dear Josephine,
powerful as you are,

11:21.708 --> 11:24.412
surely you must have sensed
this grave, new threat.

11:24.413 --> 11:27.883
And I am not without empathy,
but I have a responsibility

11:27.884 --> 11:29.183
to the witches.

11:29.184 --> 11:32.250
This is not our fight.

11:32.251 --> 11:34.851
Well, then I do hope
you understand that anyone

11:34.853 --> 11:36.623
willing to stand aside
and allow my family

11:36.624 --> 11:40.096
to be threatened...

11:41.198 --> 11:44.165
I would be forced to
consider an enemy.

11:46.834 --> 11:51.303
As I said, Elijah, I am
not without empathy.

11:53.239 --> 11:57.247
Perhaps a traditional
blessing to dispel

11:57.248 --> 12:00.185
unwanted spirits,
a barrier against those

12:00.186 --> 12:02.619
who mean to do us harm.

12:03.921 --> 12:09.431
Yes, a blessing combined
with a disruption spell

12:09.432 --> 12:12.134
should do the trick.

12:25.821 --> 12:29.157
You want some fries
with that stake?

12:29.158 --> 12:31.892
I bought one of my own at
Marie Laveau's voodoo shop.

12:31.893 --> 12:35.461
I'll have a bourbon,
please, sweetheart.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.465
Nothing. Leave us.

12:40.002 --> 12:43.408
I despise this city.

12:43.409 --> 12:46.349
Let's cut to the chase,
shall we?

12:46.350 --> 12:48.619
Your precious Freya
told me she sent you off

12:48.620 --> 12:50.688
to procure certain items
that will expedite

12:50.689 --> 12:52.623
the death of your sister-in-law.

12:52.624 --> 12:54.791
May I assume you
completed your task?

12:54.792 --> 12:57.692
There are 3 elements total.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.395
Combined, they represent
Dahlia's sole weakness.

13:01.396 --> 13:04.365
If you'd like to try
and take them,

13:04.366 --> 13:06.932
by all means, have at it.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.733
Your mind always drifts
to violence, doesn't it,

13:09.734 --> 13:12.837
even when you're
so clearly outmatched.

13:12.838 --> 13:14.406
What was it you
tried teaching us?

13:14.407 --> 13:17.177
Ah, yes, the true viking warrior

13:17.179 --> 13:20.680
hones his fear like a blade.

13:20.682 --> 13:23.914
Did you come here to critique
my parenting skills

13:23.916 --> 13:26.247
or to whine about how
little you were loved?

13:26.248 --> 13:29.750
You were weak before,
but you are weaker still.

13:29.751 --> 13:31.751
If you truly thought me weak,

13:31.753 --> 13:35.055
you would snatch
this weapon from my hand,

13:35.056 --> 13:39.420
but you don't
because you know better.

13:40.989 --> 13:45.561
I suggest we focus
on our common enemy.

13:45.562 --> 13:48.228
Rather than bringing
your materials to Freya,

13:48.229 --> 13:52.393
drawing her into a fight
she may not survive,

13:52.394 --> 13:55.263
why not join me?

13:56.674 --> 14:00.801
If we win, both our daughters
will be free.

14:00.802 --> 14:05.273
If we lose, well,
at least you die knowing

14:05.274 --> 14:08.708
the bastard finally got his due.

14:11.042 --> 14:14.683
By doing this, we should be able
to trace Dahlia's signature

14:14.684 --> 14:17.154
all the way back to
the source of her power,

14:17.155 --> 14:19.290
but I'll need to dig deep.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.960
Rebekah, if I may channel you...

14:22.962 --> 14:25.298
Are you sure you're
ok with this?

14:25.300 --> 14:28.568
Piece of cake.

14:29.957 --> 14:32.978
[Both chanting]

14:32.979 --> 14:34.247
Rrgh!

14:34.248 --> 14:36.581
[Chanting continues]

14:39.751 --> 14:41.685
Uh!

14:41.686 --> 14:43.484
Rebekah...

14:43.486 --> 14:45.253
We need to continue.

14:45.254 --> 14:47.791
I...

14:47.792 --> 14:50.262
What is it?

14:50.263 --> 14:52.465
Uh, you.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.635
You're the reason
Dahlia is able to cast

14:55.636 --> 14:58.638
such powerful spells.

14:58.639 --> 15:01.107
She's channeling you.

15:02.406 --> 15:05.015
This whole time, you've
been helping her.

15:05.016 --> 15:08.119
I had no idea.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.785
She must have found me.

15:14.689 --> 15:16.524
She wants to turn you
against me.

15:16.525 --> 15:18.359
Get away from my husband.

15:18.361 --> 15:21.030
Stop.

15:21.031 --> 15:25.465
Freya, I want
to trust you... I do...

15:25.466 --> 15:28.636
But... you said it yourself...

15:28.637 --> 15:31.340
You're bonded to Dahlia.

15:33.062 --> 15:37.313
I'm sorry, but it's
better that you go.

15:38.982 --> 15:40.850
Please.

15:46.092 --> 15:48.028
Oh...

15:48.029 --> 15:51.865
Father and son working together.

15:51.866 --> 15:54.064
I admit, I never thought
I'd live to see the day,

15:54.066 --> 15:55.966
and that's something
coming from me.

15:55.967 --> 15:58.635
And what makes you think
I need your help?

15:58.636 --> 16:00.304
Others may tremble
at the mere mention

16:00.305 --> 16:04.905
of your name, but I know you
for what you truly are...

16:04.906 --> 16:08.840
A little boy desperate
for a daddy.

16:08.841 --> 16:13.378
1,000 years ago, perhaps,
but I think we can both agree

16:13.379 --> 16:14.847
the intervening centuries
have turned me

16:14.848 --> 16:16.581
into an altogether
different beast.

16:16.582 --> 16:25.693
Your cruelty made sure of that,
and I am vicious and hateful

16:25.694 --> 16:28.229
just like you.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.599
It's precisely those qualities

16:30.600 --> 16:33.869
that make us uniquely suited
to murdering that witch.

16:33.871 --> 16:36.609
And why would I trust you?

16:36.610 --> 16:39.548
Because my daughter's
life depends on it,

16:39.549 --> 16:42.548
and you love yours
as I love mine.

16:42.549 --> 16:44.114
You see, we're fighting
for the same thing,

16:44.115 --> 16:46.116
you and I, to save the lives

16:46.117 --> 16:48.382
of the only ones
who do not see us

16:48.383 --> 16:52.556
for the monsters
that we truly are.

16:52.557 --> 16:54.626
All right, Niklaus.

16:56.729 --> 17:01.033
Tell me what you propose.

17:01.034 --> 17:04.770
You have the means to make
the weapon we need.

17:04.771 --> 17:07.472
All that remains is
to go for the kill.

17:10.075 --> 17:12.273
[Cracking]

17:17.280 --> 17:20.284
It would appear Dahlia
shares that sentiment.

17:22.821 --> 17:26.157
One final hunt together, then.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.596
Do try to keep up, old man.

17:28.598 --> 17:29.798
Hmm.

17:31.637 --> 17:34.975
[Indistinct conversations]

17:45.485 --> 17:48.025
[Conversations stop]

17:59.458 --> 18:00.909
No.

18:00.910 --> 18:02.680
[Gasps]

18:02.681 --> 18:07.719
There you are after
all these centuries.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.323
Hello, my Freya.

18:10.324 --> 18:13.160
Dahlia.

18:19.560 --> 18:21.161
[Panting]

18:22.063 --> 18:24.601
[Indistinct conversations]

18:24.603 --> 18:28.241
Hmm, how convenient
that I find you here,

18:28.242 --> 18:31.110
mere footsteps from
that which is owed to me.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.147
Let me guess.

18:33.148 --> 18:36.656
Did you make a promise
to your wretched siblings...

18:36.657 --> 18:40.392
"Together, we'll fight
the wicked witch side by side?"

18:40.394 --> 18:43.193
Ha ha! Tell me, darling,
how did they respond

18:43.194 --> 18:44.758
to your overtures?

18:44.759 --> 18:46.725
Did they welcome you
with open arms

18:46.726 --> 18:51.696
and weep tears of Joy at
your miraculous return?

18:51.697 --> 18:53.166
Hmm?

18:53.167 --> 18:55.068
What are you going to do to me?

18:55.069 --> 18:59.003
You always were a selfish,
ungrateful child.

18:59.005 --> 19:02.840
For centuries, I fed you,
clothed you, and cared for you,

19:02.842 --> 19:04.609
granted you powers
beyond anything

19:04.610 --> 19:07.777
you could have ever dreamed,
and still, you yearn for more,

19:07.778 --> 19:11.845
always wishing for another life,
never satisfied.

19:11.846 --> 19:13.212
Aah!

19:13.213 --> 19:14.646
[Whimpering]

19:14.647 --> 19:17.348
Soon enough, you will beg for me

19:17.349 --> 19:19.485
to bring you back into my home.

19:19.487 --> 19:23.188
After all, once I am done
with these poor souls,

19:23.189 --> 19:26.820
I'll be the only family
you have left.

19:26.821 --> 19:29.088
[Gasping]

19:29.089 --> 19:31.956
You should know better
than to defy me,

19:31.958 --> 19:39.362
a lesson your father and brother
will learn shortly.

19:43.198 --> 19:44.669
Elijah: What do you
mean, she's gone?

19:44.670 --> 19:46.005
She was a risk.

19:46.006 --> 19:47.105
She's also the one
person who intimately

19:47.106 --> 19:48.205
understands the enemy
we now face.

19:48.207 --> 19:49.440
Both of you, just stop it.

19:49.441 --> 19:50.974
I was protecting
hope from someone

19:50.975 --> 19:52.708
it is obvious none
of us completely trust.

19:52.709 --> 19:54.810
Correct. We've done
nothing but doubt Freya.

19:54.811 --> 19:56.378
Nevertheless,
she kept her promise,

19:56.379 --> 19:58.080
and she saved your life.

19:58.081 --> 19:59.516
We certainly
haven't demonstrated

19:59.517 --> 20:01.885
the same kindness towards her.

20:03.654 --> 20:06.322
So what the bloody hell
do we do now?

20:06.323 --> 20:08.155
There's a jazz club in Algiers

20:08.156 --> 20:10.222
by the name of the St.
James infirmary.

20:10.224 --> 20:13.696
Marcel has acquired it,
and Josephine is fortifying it

20:13.697 --> 20:15.900
as a sanctuary against magic.

20:15.901 --> 20:17.235
Pack your things.

20:17.236 --> 20:20.440
Marcel will escort you and hope
there tonight at 9:00.

20:20.441 --> 20:21.842
You wait with me.

20:21.843 --> 20:23.711
What for?

20:23.712 --> 20:28.383
If Freya should return,
we'll be here.

20:28.384 --> 20:30.385
Now, whether
we trust her or not,

20:30.387 --> 20:32.724
we cannot win this
fight without her.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.835
This is it, one last favor,

20:41.836 --> 20:42.969
and if you don't
give me his ashes,

20:42.970 --> 20:44.103
I swear I will...

20:44.104 --> 20:45.272
Davina, whatever
you may think of me,

20:45.273 --> 20:47.043
I am a man of my word.

20:47.044 --> 20:49.546
Mikael: Actually,
he's a liar, a beast,

20:49.547 --> 20:52.915
and a degenerate, but in
this exceptional instance,

20:52.916 --> 20:54.616
he may be of some use.

20:54.617 --> 20:56.447
Oh, good.
You're back.

20:56.448 --> 20:59.184
Dahlia's minion remains
within St. Anne's church.

20:59.185 --> 21:00.586
Clearly, it's a trap.

21:00.587 --> 21:02.753
Of course it's a trap,
and how good is it

21:02.754 --> 21:05.086
that we bring surprises
of our own?

21:05.087 --> 21:07.320
Wait. So you two
are friends now?

21:07.321 --> 21:08.755
Klaus: Absolutely not.

21:08.756 --> 21:10.091
We're merely aligned
out of necessity

21:10.092 --> 21:12.795
for the purpose we both
enjoy the most...

21:12.796 --> 21:15.428
Glorious murder.

21:15.429 --> 21:17.594
In fact, you'll be helping.

21:19.029 --> 21:21.231
You said you needed
a binding spell.

21:21.232 --> 21:23.399
And here... my lovely,
little witch...

21:23.400 --> 21:25.564
Is what you will bind...

21:27.597 --> 21:29.865
Soil from Dahlia's homeland,

21:29.866 --> 21:31.968
that which links her
to this mortal coil;

21:31.969 --> 21:36.071
Along with viking ash,
that of her oppressors,

21:36.072 --> 21:38.305
the source of her
immense hatred;

21:38.306 --> 21:42.641
And finally, blood
of her adopted child,

21:42.642 --> 21:45.009
my beloved daughter Freya...

21:46.911 --> 21:48.480
The closest thing to love

21:48.481 --> 21:51.182
that miserable witch
has ever known.

21:54.485 --> 21:58.924
All the sources of her power
bound together form a weakness.

21:58.925 --> 22:00.526
So what do you want me to do?

22:00.527 --> 22:02.093
Klaus: Simple.

22:02.095 --> 22:04.628
Bind those ingredients
to a weapon.

22:04.629 --> 22:07.527
Well, am I supposed to go
to the toy store

22:07.528 --> 22:10.297
and get a slingshot?

22:12.133 --> 22:13.702
Use this.

22:13.703 --> 22:15.103
You just wouldn't be you

22:15.104 --> 22:16.269
if you didn't have
a knife, would you?

22:16.270 --> 22:17.569
Well, perhaps you
can steal it later

22:17.570 --> 22:20.806
and dull its blade
with your art.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.640
[Chuckles]

22:22.641 --> 22:27.013
Do us this favor, help us end
this evil witch's reign,

22:27.014 --> 22:30.217
and I will live up to
my end of our bargain.

22:30.218 --> 22:33.951
I swear it on
my daughter's life.

22:35.583 --> 22:38.485
I hope you know
what you're doing.

22:47.821 --> 22:49.855
Freya: I need to see Elijah.

22:49.856 --> 22:52.060
Let her through.

22:52.061 --> 22:53.998
I'm actually glad you're here.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.770
Freya.

22:56.771 --> 23:00.004
I saw her...
Dahlia.

23:00.005 --> 23:03.107
She intends to make
her move tonight.

23:04.262 --> 23:07.147
Klaus and our father
will be her next victims.

23:07.148 --> 23:08.648
And you have returned
to warn the very people

23:08.649 --> 23:10.317
who would cast you out.

23:10.318 --> 23:12.119
I understand Klaus' mistrust,

23:12.120 --> 23:15.423
as I do yours,
but I did not come

23:15.424 --> 23:18.659
this far to see my family die
at the hands of the very evil

23:18.660 --> 23:22.563
that I've tried for
so long to escape.

23:22.565 --> 23:26.168
I'm begging you,
help me save them.

23:26.169 --> 23:28.536
Tell me what you need.

23:28.537 --> 23:31.270
Dahlia will lure
them into a trap.

23:31.272 --> 23:34.073
She prefers places of darkness.

23:34.074 --> 23:37.480
She'll be drawn to any site
that's been steeped in death.

23:37.481 --> 23:38.916
Well, welcome to New Orleans.

23:38.917 --> 23:42.319
Oh, no. I'm talking
about dark power

23:42.320 --> 23:45.457
created by massacre,
sacred ground

23:45.458 --> 23:48.063
that's been stained in
the blood of the innocent.

23:48.898 --> 23:52.437
[Creak]

23:58.608 --> 24:01.185
Well?

24:02.254 --> 24:08.628
What are you waiting
for, you crone?

24:10.537 --> 24:15.775
Dahlia: Now that you've arrived,
not a thing.

24:16.751 --> 24:20.648
[Wind whistling]

24:20.649 --> 24:22.952
Let us begin.

24:30.890 --> 24:34.708
Ha ha ha!
We are well met.

24:34.709 --> 24:37.848
So be it.
Are you ready?

24:37.849 --> 24:39.449
I was born ready.

24:41.943 --> 24:43.989
Agh!
[Hiss]

24:43.990 --> 24:46.938
[All shouting]

25:00.168 --> 25:02.134
Ah! Agh...

25:02.135 --> 25:04.369
I should have warned you.

25:06.676 --> 25:09.473
My acolytes are
rather formidable.

25:09.474 --> 25:10.673
Rrgh!

25:12.812 --> 25:17.594
Dahlia: I gifted them
with a fraction of my own power...

25:20.454 --> 25:23.519
To help level the playing field.

25:26.619 --> 25:27.786
Uh!

25:32.893 --> 25:35.061
[Knock knock knock]

25:35.062 --> 25:38.699
Hey, come on in and shut
the door.

25:45.541 --> 25:48.514
You're my right hand, Aiden.

25:48.515 --> 25:51.519
You've always been loyal, brave.

25:51.520 --> 25:54.787
I want you to know, I don't
take that for granted.

25:54.788 --> 25:57.858
That's why you're
the only one I can trust with this.

25:57.860 --> 26:01.763
I need to get Hayley and hope
the hell out of here tonight.

26:01.765 --> 26:04.100
Right under Klaus' roof?
He's gonna kill you.

26:04.101 --> 26:07.237
Klaus will kill me for leaving
dishes in the sink.

26:07.238 --> 26:08.539
It's all the more reason to run.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.877
I'm not joking.
Klaus will find out.

26:10.878 --> 26:12.348
He has his ways.
You know that.

26:12.349 --> 26:13.917
I got a route mapped out

26:13.918 --> 26:15.920
through side streets
and back roads.

26:15.921 --> 26:18.521
Between Dahlia's spying
and Klaus' ways,

26:18.522 --> 26:21.259
we need to get out of here fast.

26:21.260 --> 26:23.362
I need you to get
a car and meet us

26:23.363 --> 26:25.600
at the service entrance at 8:45.

26:25.601 --> 26:28.469
I mean exactly 8:45.

26:28.471 --> 26:30.572
Marcel's coming for us at 9:00.

26:30.573 --> 26:32.541
Yeah. Of course.
I'll be there.

26:34.806 --> 26:37.915
I don't know how long
I'll be away.

26:37.916 --> 26:40.451
Wolves are gonna need a leader.

26:40.452 --> 26:42.616
You up for it?

26:44.399 --> 26:47.087
[Panting]

26:49.195 --> 26:50.893
Uh...

26:50.894 --> 26:52.258
Mm...

26:56.202 --> 26:57.998
D'aagh!

26:57.999 --> 26:59.969
[All shouting]

26:59.970 --> 27:01.771
[Shudders]

27:01.772 --> 27:04.451
Aah!
Aagh!

27:06.171 --> 27:07.871
Aagh!

27:10.633 --> 27:12.014
Haagh!

27:16.855 --> 27:19.158
Josh, hey.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.693
Hey, look.

27:20.694 --> 27:23.297
Before you say anything,
I'm sorry I lied to you

27:23.298 --> 27:25.767
about my sketchy phone call
with Klaus this morning.

27:25.768 --> 27:28.806
I'm a jerk.
Wait. My bad.

27:28.807 --> 27:30.676
I accidentally did
your side of the conversation.

27:30.677 --> 27:32.309
Let's start over.
You go.

27:32.310 --> 27:33.776
You heard the phone call.

27:33.777 --> 27:36.811
Uh, yeah.
Vamp hearing, dude.

27:36.812 --> 27:38.982
You can turn it on
and off, but I'm nosy,

27:38.983 --> 27:40.787
particularly when
my boyfriend is conducting

27:40.788 --> 27:42.254
secret business
with the guy who,

27:42.255 --> 27:44.821
you know, murdered me
on my spring break.

27:44.823 --> 27:47.524
I just didn't want you
do get involved, ok?

27:47.525 --> 27:49.394
Involved in what?

27:49.395 --> 27:50.497
It's nothing.

27:50.498 --> 27:52.198
I've got it all taken care of.

27:52.199 --> 27:56.098
Whoa. Hey, wait a minute.
What is going on?

27:56.100 --> 28:00.070
No. I just...
Please.

28:00.071 --> 28:02.575
Oh, I don't know what to do.

28:02.576 --> 28:04.678
Jackson's got this
big escape plan

28:04.679 --> 28:06.179
with Hayley
and the baby tonight,

28:06.180 --> 28:07.546
and if I don't tell
Klaus, then he'll...

28:07.547 --> 28:10.382
Cut your head off with
a dull butter knife.

28:10.383 --> 28:12.752
But Jackson's been looking after me
since we were kids.

28:12.753 --> 28:13.988
I can't just stab
him in the back.

28:13.989 --> 28:15.556
I don't know
if you have a choice.

28:15.558 --> 28:17.290
He's part of my pack.

28:17.291 --> 28:18.658
You don't know what that's like.

28:18.659 --> 28:20.026
Hey, you don't have
to be a crescent wolf

28:20.027 --> 28:22.326
to love your friends.

28:24.082 --> 28:25.766
Look. It's fine.
We're gonna...

28:25.767 --> 28:28.601
We're gonna figure this out, ok?

28:35.573 --> 28:38.278
[Crack] [Crack]

28:40.014 --> 28:42.715
[Clap clap clap]

28:42.716 --> 28:45.751
[Clap clap]

28:45.752 --> 28:47.853
[Panting]

28:47.854 --> 28:51.091
Quite the operatic performance,

28:51.092 --> 28:54.593
though that is the thing
with these grand tragedies.

28:54.594 --> 29:00.001
In the end,
all the heroes die.

29:00.002 --> 29:01.906
Uh!
Nngh!

29:01.907 --> 29:05.374
D'agh!
Rrgh! Uh!

29:15.393 --> 29:17.061
Jackson: Hayley?

29:19.467 --> 29:21.103
[Fussing]

29:23.006 --> 29:24.674
Klaus and Elijah are the oldest,

29:24.675 --> 29:27.010
most powerful vampires
in the world,

29:27.011 --> 29:29.748
and Dahlia's got them scared.

29:29.749 --> 29:32.052
If she takes them down,
I don't want hope

29:32.053 --> 29:34.254
to be around to see
what happens next.

29:35.888 --> 29:38.522
[Whines]

29:38.523 --> 29:42.794
Do you really think this
is the best plan to protect her?

29:42.795 --> 29:44.630
I really do.

29:46.969 --> 29:48.637
[Panting]

29:48.638 --> 29:51.442
You struggle with such passion,

29:51.443 --> 29:56.651
all in defense of the ones you
love, an honorable quality,

29:56.652 --> 29:58.619
one which I had not anticipated,

29:58.620 --> 30:01.287
given the reputation
which precedes you.

30:04.093 --> 30:07.363
Still...

30:07.365 --> 30:10.099
A bit too little...

30:10.100 --> 30:11.869
Too late.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.839
Uh!

30:15.478 --> 30:17.611
And, you...

30:17.612 --> 30:20.343
[Panting]

30:20.344 --> 30:27.953
Husband of my sister, you
I would like to make suffer.

30:29.689 --> 30:32.388
Enough.

30:34.191 --> 30:38.332
Dahlia: My Freya, you do realize

30:38.333 --> 30:41.704
that this so-called
family of yours

30:41.705 --> 30:43.740
is simply using you
for your power.

30:43.741 --> 30:50.955
No. You're the one who used
me for 1,000 years.

30:50.956 --> 30:54.493
No more.
So be it.

30:54.494 --> 30:56.862
No!

30:56.863 --> 31:01.334
Uh! Stay away from my daughter!

31:01.335 --> 31:03.771
Uh! Ah...

31:03.772 --> 31:05.276
Uh!

31:05.277 --> 31:07.213
[Panting]

31:07.214 --> 31:09.148
[Panting]

31:09.149 --> 31:13.854
Don't you know I'm too
powerful to kill?

31:13.855 --> 31:16.024
[Stake clatters]

31:34.132 --> 31:37.439
[Panting]

31:48.789 --> 31:51.488
You ready?

32:13.455 --> 32:14.690
Any sign of them?

32:16.694 --> 32:19.828
Something's wrong.
Fan out. Find them now.

32:19.830 --> 32:22.966
[Exhales]

32:22.967 --> 32:26.472
[Hope coughs]

32:28.275 --> 32:30.411
He should be here by now.

32:30.412 --> 32:32.212
Something must have happened.

32:49.299 --> 32:50.500
[Hope crying]

32:50.501 --> 32:52.735
Shh shh shh.

32:52.736 --> 32:54.236
Everything ok?

32:57.412 --> 33:00.013
Took you long enough.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.452
Are we going
to Algiers, or what?

33:04.453 --> 33:07.087
Right now, that club
is the safest place in town.

33:16.868 --> 33:20.137
Dahlia; We all have weaknesses.

33:20.138 --> 33:24.177
You came here united
hoping to exploit mine,

33:24.178 --> 33:26.880
and in doing so,
you lost the one thing

33:26.881 --> 33:29.747
that you could have
used against me...

33:29.748 --> 33:35.085
The weapon you created,
now rendered useless.

33:35.086 --> 33:37.256
No!

33:39.792 --> 33:41.659
Now that we've dispensed
with that little trinket,

33:41.661 --> 33:43.728
perhaps we can focus
on the issue at hand.

33:43.729 --> 33:47.933
After all, I seek only
that which is owed to me,

33:47.935 --> 33:53.139
give me the child,
and you all may live.

33:53.140 --> 33:58.745
Deny me, and, well, you've had
a taste of my power.

33:58.746 --> 34:02.493
I can't imagine
you hunger for more.

34:16.748 --> 34:19.248
I told him it was traffic.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.985
Jacks was furious,
but he bought it.

34:21.985 --> 34:25.159
So I guess I live another day.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.264
Yeah? So what about tomorrow?

34:27.264 --> 34:28.730
How could I be so stupid?

34:28.731 --> 34:30.463
The moment Klaus looked at me,

34:30.464 --> 34:33.333
I should've run in
the opposite direction.

34:33.333 --> 34:37.139
Josh, um, I'm so sorry
about all of this.

34:37.141 --> 34:43.880
Yeah. Me, too, I mean, mainly
because if Klaus hurts you,

34:43.882 --> 34:46.083
I'm gonna have to seek vengeance

34:46.083 --> 34:48.588
psycho ninja style, and I think

34:48.589 --> 34:51.621
we both know how
that's gonna go.

34:55.598 --> 34:57.061
Hey...

34:59.264 --> 35:02.467
This isn't your fault,
no more than it was mine

35:02.468 --> 35:04.536
for getting my neck snapped
in some crappy dive bar.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.871
This is what Klaus does.

35:09.320 --> 35:14.217
Aiden, I've kind of been
on my own my whole life,

35:14.218 --> 35:21.024
and then suddenly, everything
was different because of you.

35:23.060 --> 35:25.529
You are my pack...

35:27.534 --> 35:29.304
You and Marcel
and Davina, and, yeah,

35:29.305 --> 35:32.674
I'd die for you
because I don't think

35:32.675 --> 35:35.709
I can go back to how
it was before.

35:35.710 --> 35:40.017
Look. We're gonna
figure this out...

35:41.286 --> 35:43.420
Together.

35:49.059 --> 35:52.162
Rebekah: Well, that sounds
like a bloody fiasco.

35:52.163 --> 35:53.831
Where's Dahlia now?

35:53.832 --> 35:57.069
She could be anywhere.

35:57.070 --> 35:59.305
There wasn't a trace of
her left at the church.

35:59.306 --> 36:01.239
She's done with us
for the night.

36:01.241 --> 36:03.276
No doubt, she wants
us to take some time

36:03.277 --> 36:05.112
to wallow in our defeat.

36:05.113 --> 36:06.747
Defeat?

36:06.748 --> 36:08.650
[Glass clacks]

36:08.651 --> 36:10.218
I disagree.

36:10.219 --> 36:12.451
We saw her face.
We took her measure.

36:12.452 --> 36:13.619
If that's the best she's got,

36:13.620 --> 36:15.121
quite frankly, I'm unimpressed.

36:15.122 --> 36:17.424
Mikael: Her aim
was not to impress us.

36:17.426 --> 36:20.591
She wanted us to reveal
our sole weapon,

36:20.593 --> 36:22.593
and, like fools, we did.

36:22.595 --> 36:24.297
Am I hearing things, or did Nik

36:24.298 --> 36:26.635
just exchange words
with our father?

36:26.637 --> 36:30.639
Rebekah. I'd know
that wicked tongue anywhere.

36:30.640 --> 36:33.272
What mischief have you
gotten yourself into now?

36:33.274 --> 36:34.842
No doubt, the bastard's doing.

36:34.843 --> 36:36.612
Enough.

36:36.613 --> 36:39.147
My patience, like
this farce of a reunion,

36:39.148 --> 36:40.747
is at an end.
Agreed.

36:40.748 --> 36:42.914
There really is
only one question here.

36:42.916 --> 36:44.816
What, exactly, are we doing?

36:44.817 --> 36:47.217
Freya: This was not my plan.

36:47.219 --> 36:50.220
You rushed it and made
but a single weapon.

36:50.221 --> 36:52.654
Of course she took it from you,

36:52.655 --> 36:54.655
and now we've lost
what advantage we had

36:54.656 --> 36:57.693
and used up the very materials
we needed to kill her.

36:57.694 --> 36:59.428
It's a bit histrionic.

36:59.429 --> 37:01.330
Your materials are easily found.

37:01.331 --> 37:03.264
Let's take stock, shall we?

37:03.265 --> 37:05.667
There's an ample supply
of your blood.

37:05.668 --> 37:07.837
Norwegian soil is hardly scarce.

37:07.838 --> 37:09.439
What else?

37:09.440 --> 37:14.343
Ah, yes... the ashes of
Dahlia's viking oppressors.

37:14.345 --> 37:17.245
Only priceless relics gotten
with great difficulty

37:17.246 --> 37:23.151
at a museum, lost due to
your worthless strategies.

37:23.152 --> 37:25.322
Uh! Uhno!

37:25.323 --> 37:27.861
If I feel even the faintest
touch of your magic, Freya,

37:27.862 --> 37:30.129
I will end him with
the flick of my wrist.

37:31.832 --> 37:33.868
You don't seem surprised.

37:33.869 --> 37:38.575
Betrayal is in your nature, boy.

37:38.577 --> 37:42.314
No. I wasn't born like this.

37:42.315 --> 37:46.154
Her you fight for...
Lovely Freya,

37:46.155 --> 37:49.556
the daughter you barely know...

37:49.557 --> 37:54.999
Yet there was a time when
you knew me as your son,

37:55.000 --> 37:56.970
a time before all
the disappointments,

37:56.971 --> 37:59.639
the revelations of betrayal.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.542
There were moments
when all you had to do

38:02.543 --> 38:05.583
was be my father, and even then,

38:05.584 --> 38:08.452
you despised me, didn't you?

38:09.917 --> 38:12.591
I want to know why.

38:14.295 --> 38:16.466
I don't know.

38:19.385 --> 38:22.034
I just did.

38:35.081 --> 38:37.712
Are those your final words?

38:43.576 --> 38:46.822
Freya...

38:46.823 --> 38:49.659
I'm so sorry.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.726
I love you.

38:50.727 --> 38:52.894
No!
Ugh!

38:52.895 --> 38:55.494
[Gasping]

39:00.676 --> 39:02.671
[Crying]

39:08.350 --> 39:11.643
[Whoosh]

39:15.578 --> 39:19.480
Viking ash is indeed rare...

39:21.886 --> 39:25.922
But all you really need
is a burning viking corpse.

39:25.923 --> 39:28.991
[Crying]

39:36.467 --> 39:41.624
[Violin playing haunting melody]

39:57.453 --> 40:01.323
Your technique is exquisite.

40:03.822 --> 40:05.464
Do you play?

40:05.465 --> 40:07.331
Ha! No.

40:07.332 --> 40:11.332
Uh-uh, not in some time.

40:11.334 --> 40:14.702
Allow me to help you
change that.

40:20.044 --> 40:21.511
[Gasps]

40:23.580 --> 40:27.483
Uh... ha ha!

40:27.484 --> 40:29.652
Ha ha!

40:29.653 --> 40:31.652
[Sniffles]

40:33.727 --> 40:37.496
Dahlia, I assume.

40:37.497 --> 40:40.663
Indeed.

40:40.664 --> 40:43.132
Now if you'll
beg my pardon, madam.

40:43.133 --> 40:45.135
I must use you to send a message

40:45.136 --> 40:47.908
to all those
who would side against me.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.849
I suppose there's no promises

40:52.850 --> 40:56.217
one old witch can
make to another.

40:56.218 --> 40:59.321
Sadly, my dear, there's nothing

40:59.322 --> 41:02.755
you can do for me
that I cannot do for myself.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.564
[Exhales]

41:06.565 --> 41:10.366
May I, then...

41:10.367 --> 41:12.732
One last tune?

41:23.081 --> 41:26.150
[Playing haunting melody]

41:34.593 --> 41:35.695
[Stops playing]

41:59.196 --> 42:03.998
