00:21.885 --> 00:24.845
A toast! To my dad, John
Shakespeare,

00:24.845 --> 00:26.445
gentleman at last!

00:26.445 --> 00:28.085
And anyone who says I ain't,

00:28.085 --> 00:30.925
I'll whack 'em on the bum with my
heraldic shield!

00:30.925 --> 00:33.085
We've finally got our coat of arms!

00:33.085 --> 00:37.205
I am a pamperloin once more,
as I was in the house of my father.

00:37.205 --> 00:41.085
No longer the wife
of a grotsome old barfing-hog,

00:41.085 --> 00:44.205
for now I be married to a gentleman.
Oh!

00:44.205 --> 00:46.765
I still can't quite believe it.

00:46.765 --> 00:50.205
Chief Herald Greene swore
he'd do anything to deny us.

00:50.205 --> 00:52.285
Ah, but that was before the Queen
saw

00:52.285 --> 00:54.325
my big midsummer donkey-gag play.

00:55.845 --> 00:58.965
She loved it and decreed
that only the son of a gentleman

00:58.965 --> 01:03.085
could have writ such wit,
and thus has she made me posh.

01:03.085 --> 01:05.045
But, master,
you've always railed and ranted

01:05.045 --> 01:08.525
against how the pamperloins and
folderols are on top in England

01:08.525 --> 01:10.285
just because they're posh.

01:10.285 --> 01:11.765
Yes, Bottom, but that was before

01:11.765 --> 01:14.525
I managed to weasel my way into the
club. Now I'm posh myself,

01:14.525 --> 01:17.085
I see the English class system is
entirely appropriate,

01:17.085 --> 01:19.045
my own elevation wholly merited

01:19.045 --> 01:22.325
and those beneath me a bunch of
feckless, undeserving oiks.

01:23.925 --> 01:25.765
I wish I could have been there
to see Greene's face,

01:25.765 --> 01:27.405
but can't risk going out in public.

01:27.405 --> 01:30.845
Too many knives sharpened, too many
musket balls with my name on them.

01:30.845 --> 01:33.125
Really, Kit? I knew you were lying
a bit low,

01:33.125 --> 01:34.565
but you're in real danger?

01:34.565 --> 01:36.525
Mortal, mate. The whole spy gig's

01:36.525 --> 01:38.805
gone completely puffling
pants-shaped.

01:38.805 --> 01:42.005
The Crown suspects me
of being a double agent.

01:42.005 --> 01:44.045
My own fault.
I keep getting pisslingtoned

01:44.045 --> 01:46.365
and forgetting which near-identical
branch

01:46.365 --> 01:49.445
of the same religion we're supposed
to hunt down and kill.

01:49.445 --> 01:50.965
Well, yes, it is confusing.

01:50.965 --> 01:53.325
Which has not gone down well
with the God-prodding pure-titties,

01:53.325 --> 01:55.045
who also accuse me of being an
atheist.

01:55.045 --> 01:58.245
I mean, in truth, Will, I'm in so
much danger, I'd be better off dead.

01:58.245 --> 01:59.725
Cheers.

01:59.725 --> 02:00.885
GIGGLING

02:00.885 --> 02:04.125
Eh-up, the girls are back. Sounds
like they've had a good time, too.

02:04.125 --> 02:07.205
It was good of Kate
to take our Sue out sightseeing.

02:07.205 --> 02:10.685
Well, who better to show her
all London's spiritual treasures

02:10.685 --> 02:14.325
than a studious, sober,
serious-minded girl like Kate?

02:14.325 --> 02:16.365
Oh, my giggly goodly godlingtons!

02:16.365 --> 02:18.645
We have bought so much craplington!

02:19.645 --> 02:23.605
Look at this brilliant shirting
vest, Dad, with a comical motif
stitched upon it.

02:23.605 --> 02:25.685
"My friend hath visited London and

02:25.685 --> 02:28.365
"all I gotteth be this stupid
under-shirting."

02:28.365 --> 02:29.965
Isn't it brilliant?

02:29.965 --> 02:33.165
And look at all these
sweet London souvenirs.

02:33.165 --> 02:36.405
A little severed head of a traitor
on a key chain.

02:37.685 --> 02:40.885
A little incinerated Catholic martyr
on a key chain.

02:41.965 --> 02:45.285
A little rotting plague corpse
on a key chain.

02:45.285 --> 02:47.925
A little country maid who had
journeyed here

02:47.925 --> 02:49.525
in search of honest work

02:49.525 --> 02:53.325
but within six weeks has become
a toothless pox-ridden prostitute

02:53.325 --> 02:54.565
on a key chain.

02:54.565 --> 02:57.405
Thanks very much, Kate.
I think we get the gist.

02:57.405 --> 02:59.805
Right, you lot, if you'd like to
start packing up,

02:59.805 --> 03:00.885
I'm sure Dad's busy.

03:00.885 --> 03:04.285
Yes, wife, 'tis true,
I am terribly pushed just now.

03:04.285 --> 03:08.285
Mine sublime big donkey-gag play
has been such a smasheroo

03:08.285 --> 03:10.685
that Burbage demands
I write another comedy,

03:10.685 --> 03:13.045
yet I have not a comic idea in my
head.

03:13.045 --> 03:15.085
That's never stopped you before.

03:16.485 --> 03:18.325
His comedy made you a gentleman.

03:18.325 --> 03:20.045
Now, come on, let's get out of his
hair.

03:20.045 --> 03:21.365
Yeah, what there is of it.

03:21.365 --> 03:23.685
Which is, in fact, a lot, daughter.

03:23.685 --> 03:26.085
The impression of thinning
is a trick of the light

03:26.085 --> 03:28.765
caused by my unusually shiny scalp.

03:28.765 --> 03:30.285
You're bald, son.

03:30.285 --> 03:31.725
Own it.

03:31.725 --> 03:34.005
I apologise to no man!

03:34.005 --> 03:36.645
IN POSH VOICE:
Especially now I'm very, very posh

03:36.645 --> 03:41.045
and terribly refined,
and quite the thing, don't you know?

03:42.525 --> 03:45.445
Watch out below, don't you know?!

03:45.445 --> 03:47.325
URINATES

03:50.685 --> 03:53.405
Shakespeare! Shakespeare!

03:53.405 --> 03:55.485
Shakespeare!

03:55.485 --> 03:58.125
That oiksome oaf is ever a thorn

03:58.125 --> 04:01.365
in my soft and tender
botty-buttocks.

04:01.365 --> 04:04.725
'Tis against all natural order
that a man of such lowly stock

04:04.725 --> 04:07.525
be permitted to rise
to a gentleman's rank.

04:07.525 --> 04:11.725
Ah, this Shakespeare must be
destroyed.

04:11.725 --> 04:12.925
But how...

04:12.925 --> 04:15.485
..when Gloriana herself hath smiled

04:15.485 --> 04:18.445
upon him because of his big
donkey-gag play?

04:19.885 --> 04:21.045
Well...

04:21.045 --> 04:24.725
If I cannot stop his genius,

04:24.725 --> 04:27.365
then perchance there is a way

04:27.365 --> 04:30.885
to deny him credit for it.

04:30.885 --> 04:33.925
Mm-hm! I begin to see my way.

04:35.085 --> 04:38.365
Mr Shakespeare, confused am I.

04:38.365 --> 04:40.605
You say you have no ideas for a
comedy,

04:40.605 --> 04:43.765
and yet I know you have been
hard at work at one for ages.

04:43.765 --> 04:45.645
And from what you've read us,

04:45.645 --> 04:48.885
I believe it will be your greatest
gag-fest yet.

04:48.885 --> 04:51.165
Comedy, child? I've writ no new
comedy.

04:51.165 --> 04:53.885
Yes, you have.
The one you keep telling us about.

04:53.885 --> 04:55.485
The one about the Prince of Denmark.

04:57.845 --> 05:01.405
You mean Hamlet?
Hilarious central character!

05:01.405 --> 05:02.725
Pure genius.

05:02.725 --> 05:05.805
A grumpy, whiny, self-important
student

05:05.805 --> 05:08.005
who does up absolutely zero
coursework

05:08.005 --> 05:09.725
and will not get over himself!

05:09.725 --> 05:11.605
I just love it!

05:11.605 --> 05:14.245
Get a job, you useless bastable.

05:14.245 --> 05:16.205
He's like, "I'm a prince and I live
in a castle,

05:16.205 --> 05:19.765
"and I'm really, really rich,
but I'm also really, really sad."

05:19.765 --> 05:22.765
"I've got parent issues,
and nobody understands me,

05:22.765 --> 05:26.365
"and I'm just, like, questioning
the whole point of my existence!"

05:26.365 --> 05:28.805
"I think I might kill myself!"
"Except maybe I won't."

05:28.805 --> 05:30.725
"Maybe I will."
"Maybe I won't."

05:30.725 --> 05:31.805
"Maybe I will."

05:31.805 --> 05:35.125
Just do it, you selfish
arsingmongel! Nobody cares!

05:35.125 --> 05:37.085
I mean, what is his problem?

05:37.085 --> 05:40.085
His problem is that
he is being haunted by his father,

05:40.085 --> 05:43.965
who was murdered by his uncle,
who is sleeping with his mother!

05:43.965 --> 05:45.365
ALL LAUGH HYSTERICALLY

05:45.365 --> 05:46.805
I know!

05:46.805 --> 05:48.685
Talk about a dysfunctional family!

05:48.685 --> 05:50.645
It's just brilliant for comedy!

05:50.645 --> 05:52.885
For me, it's the structure
which is so original.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.325
At the start his dad says,
"Avenge me!"

05:55.325 --> 05:59.045
And Hamlet says, "On it, Dad.
I will avenge you right away."

05:59.045 --> 06:00.205
But then he doesn't.

06:00.205 --> 06:02.245
For five flipping acts!

06:02.245 --> 06:05.285
Honestly, Mr S, you are amazing!

06:05.285 --> 06:07.005
Creating a vain, entitled,

06:07.005 --> 06:09.525
self-obsessed,
procrastinating crybaby

06:09.525 --> 06:12.565
who's taken up permanent residence
in his own arsington!

06:13.605 --> 06:16.045
I imagine it could have been
centuries

06:16.045 --> 06:18.885
before someone came up with a comedy
around a person like that.

06:18.885 --> 06:21.285
But it's supposed to be tragic!

06:21.285 --> 06:22.445
And it is.

06:22.445 --> 06:25.565
As in, "Oh, my God,
that bloke is just tragic!"

06:25.565 --> 06:28.245
My favourite bit
is the mini-farce at the end.

06:28.245 --> 06:29.885
Mini-farce at the end?!

06:29.885 --> 06:31.205
The death scene.

06:31.205 --> 06:34.725
Oh, it's so over the top you must
have needed a ladder to write that!

06:34.725 --> 06:36.165
KNOCK AT DOOR

06:36.165 --> 06:37.765
I'll get it.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.605
My Hamlet is not a comedy!

06:39.605 --> 06:41.645
It is a forensically astute journey

06:41.645 --> 06:44.085
into the tortured heart of the human
soul!

06:44.085 --> 06:48.205
Its fearless examination of the
agonising reality of existence

06:48.205 --> 06:51.925
is searingly perceptive,
particularly the death scene!

06:51.925 --> 06:55.685
Will, come on, please! The Hamlet
death scene? Forensically astute?

06:55.685 --> 06:57.085
Fearlessly realistic?

06:57.085 --> 06:59.085
You are pulling my plonkington.

07:00.685 --> 07:02.845
I am not pulling your plonkington.

07:02.845 --> 07:06.045
Hamlet's death scene is the greatest
and most convincing scene

07:06.045 --> 07:07.245
I have ever written.

07:07.245 --> 07:11.525
An 18-page masterclass on the true
nature of life and death!

07:11.525 --> 07:15.365
However, since Burbage requires
a light and whimsical comedy,

07:15.365 --> 07:18.005
I must set aside my tragic
masterpiece

07:18.005 --> 07:20.285
and search for an idea elsewhere.

07:20.285 --> 07:21.645
I found this note under the door.

07:22.685 --> 07:23.885
Ouch.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.205
Well, that's a bit worrying, what
with London seething with people

07:26.205 --> 07:29.245
who would long to see my gutlings
spilled from my quartered body.

07:29.245 --> 07:31.685
Gutlings spilled
from your quartered body, Kit?

07:31.685 --> 07:33.725
Can things really be as serious as
that?

07:33.725 --> 07:37.085
You know how it is.
Live by the sword, die by the sword.

07:37.085 --> 07:38.925
Well, obviously, I know, Kit.

07:38.925 --> 07:42.045
'Twas I that coined the
phrase...in...

07:42.045 --> 07:43.565
..in my Richard, I think,

07:43.565 --> 07:46.445
or possibly a random Henry.
A lot of swords in those.

07:46.445 --> 07:48.245
But definitely one of mine.

07:48.245 --> 07:50.485
Why then, Mr Shakespeare,
call the watch!

07:50.485 --> 07:52.325
Appeal to the Privy Council!

07:52.325 --> 07:54.365
Cry, "Foul and naughty tricks!"

07:54.365 --> 07:56.725
for I fear you have been
plagiarised.

07:56.725 --> 07:59.765
Plagiarised? By whom?
Who's stealing my biggies?

07:59.765 --> 08:01.285
Name this thieving bastable!

08:01.285 --> 08:02.685
The Apostle Matthew.

08:02.685 --> 08:05.045
The swine! And him a man of God!

08:05.045 --> 08:08.965
Mr Shakespeare, "he who lives by the
sword shall die by the sword"

08:08.965 --> 08:10.245
is in the Bible.

08:10.245 --> 08:11.725
Really? Are you sure?

08:11.725 --> 08:13.005
Yes.

08:13.005 --> 08:15.845
Matthew, chapter 26, verse 52.

08:15.845 --> 08:19.165
Although, interestingly,
he didn't come up with it either.

08:19.165 --> 08:23.845
A form of the phrase first appears
in the Ancient Greek play Agamemnon

08:23.845 --> 08:26.045
by the immortal dramatist Aeschylus.

08:26.045 --> 08:28.885
Well, if the Apostle Matthew
can pinch it, then so can I.

08:28.885 --> 08:31.525
Yes, Kit, definitely one of mine!

08:31.525 --> 08:34.765
And so do I continue my private task
of sowing confusion

08:34.765 --> 08:38.845
about what I actually wrote
and what people merely THINK I did.

08:38.845 --> 08:42.485
Until the day dawns when people
in their ignorance and vanity

08:42.485 --> 08:45.365
will attribute
any archaic-sounding truism to me

08:45.365 --> 08:48.165
in the certitude
that it might easily have been me,

08:48.165 --> 08:50.765
and if it wasn't,
no-one will know the diff.

08:52.605 --> 08:54.565
Thus will I eventually get credit

08:54.565 --> 08:57.125
for inventing the entire English
language.

08:58.725 --> 09:02.605
So, shove that up your Canterbury
Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer!

09:03.605 --> 09:06.245
This is interesting.
It's from Robert Greene.

09:06.245 --> 09:10.325
He is organising an intellectual
salon of London's foremost writers.

09:10.325 --> 09:13.765
They intend to retreat to the
country for - get this -

09:13.765 --> 09:17.005
a whole year,
forswearing all rumpy-pumpington

09:17.005 --> 09:19.445
and, instead, discussing Roman
philosophy

09:19.445 --> 09:21.725
far from the distracting company
of women.

09:21.725 --> 09:25.125
Eheu, feminae tam stultae sunt ut de
philosophia

09:25.125 --> 09:27.125
Romana disputare nequeat.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.605
What was that, Kate?

09:28.605 --> 09:31.605
I know it, of course,
but for Bottom's sake.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.925
It's Latin for "how sad that women
are too stupid

09:33.925 --> 09:35.565
"to discuss Roman philosophy".

09:35.565 --> 09:37.565
Well, yes, it is a shame,
but there you go.

09:37.565 --> 09:41.205
No point crying about it. Birds
are thick. Can't change nature.

09:41.205 --> 09:42.405
Get over it.

09:42.405 --> 09:43.965
Anyway, this is GREAT news.

09:43.965 --> 09:46.885
I mean, normally I wouldn't go
within 100 miles of a no-sex
salon,

09:46.885 --> 09:48.525
but with every man's hand
against me,

09:48.525 --> 09:51.165
this could be the perfect place to
hide until the heat's off.

09:51.165 --> 09:52.605
And great news for me, too, Kit.

09:52.605 --> 09:55.605
A posh boys' literary retreat
is just the place I need

09:55.605 --> 09:58.085
to come up with an idea for this
comedy which eludes me.

09:58.085 --> 10:01.325
But, Mr Shakespeare, a whole year
forswearing rumpy-pumpington?

10:01.325 --> 10:03.245
Won't your wife object?

10:03.245 --> 10:05.805
I don't think Anne will mind
missing out on one bonk, Kate.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.605
She's...

10:07.605 --> 10:10.165
She's not a sex maniac.

10:10.165 --> 10:11.805
Botsky, pack my bags.

10:11.805 --> 10:13.285
Hang on, Will,
the invitation's just to me.

10:13.285 --> 10:15.125
Outrage!

10:15.125 --> 10:18.565
London's daintiest poets assemble
and I'm excluded?!

10:18.565 --> 10:21.205
They might as well have a gathering
of jungle beasts

10:21.205 --> 10:22.445
and not invite the lion!

10:22.445 --> 10:25.165
Of Greek gods and not invite Zeus!

10:25.165 --> 10:28.845
Of pie fillings
and not invite steak and kidney!

10:28.845 --> 10:31.805
I'd have said chicken and mushroom.
Ham and leek for me. King of pies.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.485
You're crazy. Apple and blackberry.

10:33.485 --> 10:35.085
Oh, well, if we're allowed
sweet fillings...

10:35.085 --> 10:38.285
ARE we allowed sweet fillings at
this pie-gathering metaphor, Will?

10:39.365 --> 10:41.325
No, I think only savoury.

10:41.325 --> 10:42.565
Look, it doesn't matter!

10:42.565 --> 10:44.165
The point is that,

10:44.165 --> 10:48.205
yet again, pamperloins and folderols
are snooting their cocks at me!

10:48.205 --> 10:50.525
Well, I shall create my own country
salon.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.965
Bottom, pack my bags!

10:51.965 --> 10:54.805
We're off to Stratters,
where I shall write a great comedy.

10:54.805 --> 10:57.365
Or you could just give them Hamlet,
save us a trip.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.405
Hamlet is not a comedy!

10:59.405 --> 11:01.005
ALL LAUGH

11:03.165 --> 11:05.565
Water only, if you please,
Mistress Lucy,

11:05.565 --> 11:09.925
for we are here to discuss
the forming of a literary salon.

11:09.925 --> 11:11.605
A literary salon? Hm!

11:11.605 --> 11:14.445
What in the name of Mufasa,
the legendary lion king,

11:14.445 --> 11:16.525
and his playful son, Simba, is that?

11:16.525 --> 11:18.925
An intellectual grouping
where all who attend

11:18.925 --> 11:21.125
will live lives of mental strength
and resilience,

11:21.125 --> 11:25.005
forswearing all rumpy-pumpington
for a whole year.

11:25.005 --> 11:29.205
Ah-ah-eh-eh. Such tests are also
common in African culture.

11:29.205 --> 11:32.525
When it is time for a young
Masai warrior to become a man,

11:32.525 --> 11:35.765
he herds cattle
all alone for many, many days,

11:35.765 --> 11:38.405
then he allows himself to be
circumcised

11:38.405 --> 11:43.005
by a crazy old fool with no medical
training using a stone tool.

11:43.005 --> 11:45.645
Thus proving mental strength
and resilience?

11:45.645 --> 11:49.165
Thus proving that all men are
idiots, wherever they come from. Hm.

11:49.165 --> 11:52.445
Foolish, heathen woman.

11:52.445 --> 11:56.485
But now she hath removed herself
from our conversation

11:56.485 --> 11:58.525
will I speak my darkest thoughts.

11:59.765 --> 12:03.325
This country salon is a ploy,
a trick,

12:03.325 --> 12:04.605
part of an ingenious plot

12:04.605 --> 12:07.245
to destroy William Shakespeare.

12:07.245 --> 12:10.405
Are we to lure him into the country
to kill him, Mr Greene?

12:10.405 --> 12:13.165
I fear, Sir Francis, that killing
him is no longer enough.

12:13.165 --> 12:17.005
'Tis not the man we must destroy
but his reputation.

12:17.005 --> 12:19.725
But how?
Shakespeare is the man of the hour.

12:19.725 --> 12:23.845
Exactly, Your Grace, but I speak not
of hours, nor days, nor yet years,

12:23.845 --> 12:26.845
but decades, centuries, even.

12:26.845 --> 12:29.245
For today we begin to sow the seeds
of doubt

12:29.245 --> 12:31.245
that will make people question

12:31.245 --> 12:34.205
whether Shakespeare
ever wrote his plays at all.

12:35.285 --> 12:37.325
And the first step in my plan

12:37.325 --> 12:40.565
is to kill...not Shakespeare...

12:40.565 --> 12:42.805
..but Marlowe.

12:48.485 --> 12:52.125
Don't ask. Simply do not ask!

12:52.125 --> 12:53.365
Good journey, love?

12:53.365 --> 12:56.725
Well, I did say, "Don't ask,"
but since you have asked,

12:56.725 --> 12:58.685
no, I did not have a good journey!

12:58.685 --> 13:01.805
Not only was it dirty, uncomfortable
and delayed,

13:01.805 --> 13:05.605
but also it turns out I paid
three shillings more for our tickets

13:05.605 --> 13:08.005
than anybody else on the coach.

13:08.005 --> 13:09.605
How did you manage that, son?

13:09.605 --> 13:13.085
How, Mum? Because in my madness,
my utter insanity,

13:13.085 --> 13:16.085
I bought my coach ticket
at the coach station

13:16.085 --> 13:18.485
on the day I wanted to get on
a coach.

13:21.005 --> 13:23.005
A ridiculous thing to do, of course,

13:23.005 --> 13:25.205
as I discovered when we got mired in
mud.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.725
Heavy downpour near Leamington Spa.

13:26.725 --> 13:29.005
Because, obviously, there's never
been rain in the Midlands before,

13:29.005 --> 13:30.605
so how could the geniuses
that manage

13:30.605 --> 13:33.365
the coaching infrastructure
possibly have expected mud?

13:33.365 --> 13:37.805
Anyway, talk amongst the stranded
travellers turned to ticket pricing,

13:37.805 --> 13:41.285
and, oh, what a labyrinthine maze
of satanic complexity

13:41.285 --> 13:42.525
was then revealed!

13:42.525 --> 13:45.565
First to speak was a goodly matron

13:45.565 --> 13:48.805
who had bought an off-peak
super family savington.

13:50.045 --> 13:52.325
Booked prior to the day of
departure

13:52.325 --> 13:54.725
and valid only on certain
services.

13:54.725 --> 13:57.085
For this she had paid tuppence.

13:57.085 --> 14:01.325
Well, an off-peak family concession
sounds like a reasonable idea.

14:01.325 --> 14:05.925
Then piped up a rank and stinking
yeoman who had spent but a penny

14:05.925 --> 14:09.125
on a nontransferable specialington
savey-savey,

14:09.125 --> 14:12.365
purchased no less
than a week before travel

14:12.365 --> 14:14.405
and accepted only on coaches that
depart

14:14.405 --> 14:16.685
between the hours of 10 and 11
each morning.

14:16.685 --> 14:20.485
Well, travelling when the service
is less busy would help.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.725
Finally, spake a stern and warty
spinster

14:23.725 --> 14:25.405
who had paid a farthing

14:25.405 --> 14:28.405
for a double-discount cut-rate
supesome-dupesome,

14:28.405 --> 14:32.525
savey-wavey, chips-and-gravy,
age-concession, off-peaky-weaky,

14:32.525 --> 14:35.605
purchased in a previous life
and valid only on coaches

14:35.605 --> 14:37.765
where the driver's middle name
was Gerald!

14:39.205 --> 14:42.445
I am not a soothsayer.
I am not Nostradamus!

14:42.445 --> 14:44.085
He'd have been all right, wouldn't
he?

14:44.085 --> 14:47.125
As well as predicting the end of
days and the coming of the
Antichrist,

14:47.125 --> 14:49.965
he could have foreseen
that on some specific date

14:49.965 --> 14:53.645
in the dim and distant future, he'd
want a return ticket to Chipping
Norton!

14:55.645 --> 14:57.485
But what are you doing home,
anyway, love?

14:57.485 --> 15:00.725
We left London so you could get on
with your new comedy.

15:00.725 --> 15:03.445
I find I crave
the peace of the country, wife.

15:03.445 --> 15:06.765
In fact, I'm convening
a country literary salon.

15:06.765 --> 15:08.845
Greene invited me to his, but I told
him,

15:08.845 --> 15:10.485
"Just because I'd been made
gentleman

15:10.485 --> 15:13.285
"doesn't mean I want to hang out
with you snootish pamperloins."

15:13.285 --> 15:15.965
You mean they DIDN'T invite you.

15:15.965 --> 15:18.365
No, they bloomin' well didn't,
but if they had,

15:18.365 --> 15:20.685
that's definitely
what I would have told them.

15:20.685 --> 15:23.845
You've got to use your anger, Dad,
empower yourself.

15:23.845 --> 15:26.725
Write a comedy about a literary
salon.

15:26.725 --> 15:30.525
Do a play about a bunch of stupid
posh boys who are so up themselves

15:30.525 --> 15:33.805
they give up sex
so they can study Roman philosophy.

15:33.805 --> 15:35.765
Well, I agree, it's not a bad
set-up,

15:35.765 --> 15:38.085
but I couldn't stretch it
across five acts.

15:38.085 --> 15:39.925
Well, you've got to work it up a
bit.

15:39.925 --> 15:43.205
How about once they've come up with
the no-sex rule,

15:43.205 --> 15:44.765
some hot babes turn up?

15:44.765 --> 15:47.165
HE CLEARS THROAT
As I was about to say,

15:47.165 --> 15:50.285
the way to make it work would be
to have some hot babes turn up.

15:52.405 --> 15:54.965
Tell me a bit more
of what I was about to say.

15:54.965 --> 15:58.805
Obviously, the snooty posh boys
are gagging for the hot babes,

15:58.805 --> 16:01.365
but they're stuck
with their stupid no-girls rule.

16:01.365 --> 16:03.485
Loving it. God, I'm good!

16:03.485 --> 16:07.165
So, each lad has to try and grab a
girl in secret

16:07.165 --> 16:10.045
so their mates don't find out
that they've broken the bro code.

16:10.045 --> 16:12.845
Brilliant. They're
all covering up the same lie.

16:12.845 --> 16:14.325
How will you end it?

16:14.325 --> 16:16.725
I mean, how will I end it?

16:16.725 --> 16:18.365
I reckon, when all is revealed

16:18.365 --> 16:22.405
and the posh boys have learnt the
lesson of their conceited ways,

16:22.405 --> 16:26.125
the hot girls bugger off and tell
their humble suitors to wait a year

16:26.125 --> 16:28.285
before they can cop a bit of a
feel-up.

16:28.285 --> 16:31.125
And I've even thought up a punch
line.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.765
Well, I must say,
it sounds like a fun idea.

16:33.765 --> 16:36.605
Yes, and now it only remains to
crowbar in

16:36.605 --> 16:40.845
the incomprehensible subplots
and pointless minor characters,

16:40.845 --> 16:42.605
and I'll be done.

16:42.605 --> 16:44.925
I knew it was too good to be true.

16:44.925 --> 16:47.365
Master, don't go there. You've
got your plot. Just leave it be.

16:47.365 --> 16:50.885
Don't be absurd. Pointless minor
characters and incomprehensible
subplots

16:50.885 --> 16:53.605
are my signature thing.
But people love them.

16:53.605 --> 16:57.325
And I only expect them
to get more popular over the years.

16:57.325 --> 16:58.765
Particularly with schoolchildren...

16:59.765 --> 17:02.005
..who will no doubt delight in being

17:02.005 --> 17:05.045
forced to read my plays out in
class.

17:05.045 --> 17:08.645
Imagine it. The master will hand out
all the big roles to his favourites,

17:08.645 --> 17:11.045
and all the snotsome grotsomes at
the back

17:11.045 --> 17:13.365
will think themselves passed over,

17:13.365 --> 17:17.205
but then, oh, joy,
there be myriad minor characters

17:17.205 --> 17:19.845
servicing the incomprehensible
subplot,

17:19.845 --> 17:21.925
so they won't miss out after all.

17:21.925 --> 17:26.525
It's like a curse on youth
ricocheting down the years.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.605
Miss Lucy is come calling, Mr
Marlowe.

17:30.605 --> 17:34.285
I told her Mr Shakespeare was in
Stratford, but she says she wants
you.

17:34.285 --> 17:36.365
You are in great danger, Mr Marlowe.

17:36.365 --> 17:39.125
Mr Greene, Sir Francis Bacon
and the Earl of Oxford

17:39.125 --> 17:41.605
intend to lure you to the country
and kill you.

17:41.605 --> 17:42.925
Goodness, Miss Lucy, but why?

17:42.925 --> 17:44.845
Ah, to discredit Mr Shakespeare.

17:44.845 --> 17:47.645
Mr Greene believes
that if you disappear mysteriously,

17:47.645 --> 17:49.605
a theory of conspiracy will develop,

17:49.605 --> 17:53.205
that you went into hiding to escape
the complex world of espionage

17:53.205 --> 17:55.045
and sexual indiscretions

17:55.045 --> 17:57.205
in which you were mired.
Oh.

17:57.205 --> 17:59.285
But you continue to write plays
in secret,

17:59.285 --> 18:01.085
using Mr Shakespeare's name as a
cover.

18:01.085 --> 18:04.845
Goodness. That does sound
like rather an attractive theory.

18:04.845 --> 18:07.805
Yes. And a lot more interesting
than all those works of genius

18:07.805 --> 18:11.045
being written by a town-school
baldy-bonce from the Midlands.

18:11.045 --> 18:13.925
Mr Marlowe, you must not go
to this literary salon,

18:13.925 --> 18:16.205
for if you do... Hey!

18:16.205 --> 18:17.605
..you will not return.

18:22.845 --> 18:25.165
I have my new comedy and, what's
more,

18:25.165 --> 18:27.085
I've just thought of the
title.

18:27.085 --> 18:29.525
Since it be about the effort
that goes into wooing,

18:29.525 --> 18:32.205
I shall call it Love's Labour's.

18:32.205 --> 18:34.845
Ooh, I quite like it.

18:34.845 --> 18:36.925
It just feels like it's missing
something.

18:36.925 --> 18:39.765
Maybe a third word beginning with L.

18:39.765 --> 18:41.645
Lampooned.

18:41.645 --> 18:43.365
Too comical.

18:43.365 --> 18:45.165
Kind of announces the funny.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.645
Yeah, you don't want to lure them in
with false expectations.

18:51.245 --> 18:54.125
How about "lanced", like a boil?

18:54.125 --> 18:55.885
Love's Labour's Lanced?

18:55.885 --> 18:57.085
Not bad.

18:57.085 --> 18:58.485
Lubricated.

19:01.845 --> 19:03.845
Goes to a slightly weird place
and...

19:04.725 --> 19:06.045
..perhaps a bit long.

19:06.045 --> 19:09.525
It needs a nice, short, punchy word
with a touch of regret.

19:09.525 --> 19:10.645
Got it!

19:10.645 --> 19:12.405
Lost.
Licked.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.245
Love's Labour's Licked?

19:15.245 --> 19:18.285
It's perfect.
Licked, as in "got it licked".

19:18.285 --> 19:21.165
The posh bird has taken the
pamperloin's love

19:21.165 --> 19:22.565
and she's licked it.

19:22.565 --> 19:24.965
Will! Will!

19:26.005 --> 19:28.405
Pardon me, all.
Just need to talk to the man.

19:28.405 --> 19:30.285
I'm in mortal danger.
You've got to help me.

19:30.285 --> 19:32.125
Goodness, Kit, do you want us to
hide you?

19:32.125 --> 19:33.805
No, it's not good enough. They'll
find me.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.765
I need to fake my own death,
and it must be utterly convincing.

19:36.765 --> 19:38.605
We can leave nothing to chance.

19:38.605 --> 19:43.045
No, absolutely! This death scene
has to be forensically astute.

19:43.045 --> 19:44.605
You've got that right.

19:44.605 --> 19:46.445
Fearlessly realistic.
Totally.

19:46.445 --> 19:50.525
A masterclass on the
true nature of life and death.

19:50.525 --> 19:52.805
I think you know
where I'm going with this.

19:52.805 --> 19:54.045
Ah...

19:57.085 --> 20:00.805
Gentlemen, this enforced idleness
in the country

20:00.805 --> 20:02.965
will be worth the trouble.

20:02.965 --> 20:05.405
With Marlowe's disappearance,

20:05.405 --> 20:08.765
I plant the first of my theories of
conspiracy

20:08.765 --> 20:13.845
which will dog the Crow's reputation
for all time.

20:14.045 --> 20:16.005
The first, Mr Greene? You have more?

20:16.005 --> 20:17.605
Oh, yes.

20:17.605 --> 20:19.405
Next must you, Sir Francis Bacon,

20:19.405 --> 20:22.205
ensure that included in your future
writings

20:22.205 --> 20:25.325
there be certain words and
punctuation

20:25.325 --> 20:28.605
common to those used by
Mr Shakespeare.

20:28.605 --> 20:32.885
Thus will future anally retentive,
self-important saddos

20:32.885 --> 20:37.525
find evidence of similarity
between your works and his

20:37.525 --> 20:41.005
and conclude that you are
Shakespeare.

20:41.005 --> 20:43.725
But, Mr Greene, of course there will
be similarities

20:43.725 --> 20:46.445
of words and punctuation.
We both write in English.

20:46.445 --> 20:47.565
Exactly.

20:47.565 --> 20:50.125
It's so conclusive,
I'm almost convinced myself.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.165
And you, my dear Earl of Oxford,

20:53.165 --> 20:55.165
I intend that you, too, will one day

20:55.165 --> 20:58.325
be thought of as a putative author
of the Crow's plays.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.085
This is absurd, Mr Greene.

21:00.085 --> 21:03.205
There is not one single shred of
evidence linking either Marlowe,

21:03.205 --> 21:05.445
Bacon or myself
to Shakespeare's plays.

21:05.445 --> 21:06.765
Exactly.

21:06.765 --> 21:08.285
There is no evidence.

21:08.285 --> 21:11.005
Can you think of better proof
of a cover-up?

21:11.005 --> 21:13.045
And it begins...

21:13.045 --> 21:15.045
..with the death...

21:15.045 --> 21:18.485
..of Christopher Marlowe.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.085
And so you see, gentlemen,

21:20.085 --> 21:22.405
Mr Marlowe's enemies gather for
the kill,

21:22.405 --> 21:23.725
and the only way to save him

21:23.725 --> 21:25.445
is for the world to believe him
dead.

21:25.445 --> 21:29.005
So, you intend we fake
Mr Marlowe's death in a fight?

21:29.005 --> 21:30.125
Absolutely.

21:30.125 --> 21:32.565
And, in so doing, prove to you
and sneering Kit

21:32.565 --> 21:34.885
that my sublime Hamlet is not a
comedy

21:34.885 --> 21:37.405
but bitter human truth.
Good luck with that.

21:37.405 --> 21:41.125
We will rehearse the scene now and
perform it later in a crowded
tavern.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.565
So, to work.

21:42.565 --> 21:45.645
Mr Marlowe arrives at the tavern
full of fury.

21:45.645 --> 21:48.005
Intent on killing me.
Yes, that's right.

21:48.005 --> 21:50.845
You're playing his uncle, Claudius.
Claudius? Why Claudius?

21:50.845 --> 21:52.445
Oh, just thought it was a good name

21:52.445 --> 21:54.125
for a murdering, cuckolding
bastable.

21:54.125 --> 21:57.525
Ah! So he's a murdering,
cuckolding bastable, is he?

21:57.525 --> 21:58.965
I like it!

21:58.965 --> 22:02.725
I shall give him a stoop and a limp
for extra naturalism!

22:02.725 --> 22:06.725
Love it. Now, Marlowe wants you dead
because you poisoned his dad.

22:06.725 --> 22:09.365
Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.
I certainly will.

22:09.365 --> 22:10.965
He poured it in his ear.

22:10.965 --> 22:14.005
ALL GIGGLE
I'm sorry, that's funny?

22:14.005 --> 22:17.565
Yeah. "Oh, I want to poison my
brother. How shall I do it?

22:17.565 --> 22:21.725
"Shall I secretly put it in his wine
or discreetly bake it in his pie?

22:21.725 --> 22:23.085
"No, I'll pour it in his ear.

22:23.085 --> 22:25.285
"Isn't that how everybody poisons
people?"

22:25.285 --> 22:27.405
Actually, I do think
Mr Shakespeare is right.

22:27.405 --> 22:28.605
Thank you, Burbage.

22:28.605 --> 22:31.845
Yes, the odd comic detail will pique
the public interest in the case.

22:31.845 --> 22:34.725
It is not comic, it's cruelly
poignant.

22:34.725 --> 22:39.005
Now, having murdered Hamlet's dad -
I mean, Marlowe's dad -

22:39.005 --> 22:42.365
Uncle Claudius is now a-dallying
with Marlowe's mum.

22:42.365 --> 22:45.485
Mr Condell, you will
play Kit's mother, Gertrude.

22:45.485 --> 22:47.925
Quite a challenge.
I'm horribly young for it.

22:47.925 --> 22:50.765
Gertrude and Claudius
are flirting together

22:50.765 --> 22:54.285
and Marlowe arrives full of fury,
bent on revenge.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.645
I leap to my feet!

22:55.645 --> 22:58.085
A savage, stooped and limping
villain!

22:58.085 --> 23:00.405
We fight! He dies! I like it!

23:00.405 --> 23:02.325
Yes, an excellent plot.

23:02.325 --> 23:04.965
And one I feel sure
will satisfy the authorities.

23:04.965 --> 23:07.125
Don't be ridiculous.
That's not a death scene.

23:07.125 --> 23:08.965
Blimey, there's only one death.

23:08.965 --> 23:11.645
Besides which,
we need complex motivations.

23:11.645 --> 23:14.925
Kit had a girlfriend, Ophelia,
who has been driven mad.

23:14.925 --> 23:17.925
Trying to follow this plot.
Who said that? I did. So...

23:17.925 --> 23:20.565
Because Kit has previously
accidentally stabbed her father.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.005
Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.

23:22.005 --> 23:25.085
He was hiding behind a curtain
and Kit stabbed him by mistake.

23:25.085 --> 23:26.245
ALL LAUGH

23:26.245 --> 23:27.965
Which is not funny!

23:27.965 --> 23:31.125
Ophelia, of course,
goes mad with grief and dies.

23:31.125 --> 23:32.645
Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.245
She drowns in a duck pond.

23:34.245 --> 23:35.605
ALL GUFFAW

23:35.605 --> 23:37.485
There's a duck pond in this pub,
then?

23:37.485 --> 23:39.885
The duck pond is offstage.
I mean, elsewhere.

23:39.885 --> 23:41.325
Her death is reported

23:41.325 --> 23:42.805
and will, in my view, one day

23:42.805 --> 23:45.165
provide the excuse
for many pervy paintings

23:45.165 --> 23:48.725
by dirty old artists depicting dead
nymphets in wet nighties.

23:48.725 --> 23:52.125
But the point is, Ophelia's death
is important backstory,

23:52.125 --> 23:56.165
because, as Kit turns up, hellbent
on confronting his wicked uncle...

23:56.165 --> 23:57.685
Just to be clear, young Will,

23:57.685 --> 23:59.005
how does Mr Marlowe know

23:59.005 --> 24:01.325
that it's his uncle who's killed his
father?

24:01.325 --> 24:03.205
Yes. Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.

24:03.205 --> 24:04.925
His father's ghost told him.

24:04.925 --> 24:06.125
ALL GUFFAW

24:06.125 --> 24:08.125
Which is not funny!

24:08.125 --> 24:10.525
So, Mr Marlowe, plagued by his
father's ghost,

24:10.525 --> 24:11.805
has come to kill his uncle.

24:11.805 --> 24:14.045
Just then, Laertes turns up.

24:14.045 --> 24:15.085
That's you, Kempe.

24:15.085 --> 24:17.445
So, Laertes? Have I missed
something?

24:17.445 --> 24:20.965
He's Ophelia's brother, bent
on avenging his father and his
sister.

24:20.965 --> 24:23.685
So, we now have two sons
avenging their fathers?

24:23.685 --> 24:26.005
Isn't this getting a little
confusing, Will?

24:26.005 --> 24:27.845
How? How is it confusing?

24:27.845 --> 24:29.485
One of the avenging sons is avenging

24:29.485 --> 24:31.285
his stabbed father and drowned
sister.

24:31.285 --> 24:34.285
And the other is avenging
his poisoned father and defiled
mother.

24:34.285 --> 24:35.965
How could that be any clearer?

24:35.965 --> 24:39.765
Ooh, can't think...
So, Burbage and Condell are sitting
in the pub together

24:39.765 --> 24:41.285
having a flirt and a banter.

24:41.285 --> 24:43.685
Oh, can I have some pickled herrings
to toy with?

24:43.685 --> 24:46.525
I'd like a bit of business, as I
don't seem to have much in this
scene.

24:46.525 --> 24:48.165
No, Mr Condell, because I know you,

24:48.165 --> 24:51.365
and suddenly Marlowe's death
would be all about the pickled
herrings.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.885
That's an outrageous slur!

24:52.885 --> 24:55.725
Kit bursts in, full of murderous
fury,

24:55.725 --> 24:59.765
but then Laertes also bursts in,
also full of murderous fury.

24:59.765 --> 25:03.205
Kempe wounds Kit,
but, in the struggle, Kempe dies.

25:03.205 --> 25:04.725
Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.

25:04.725 --> 25:06.045
By stabbing himself.

25:06.045 --> 25:08.485
ALL LAUGH
As you do.

25:08.485 --> 25:10.325
Condell, seeing her son wounded

25:10.325 --> 25:13.765
and feeling a bit guilty
about rogering his uncle, also dies.

25:13.765 --> 25:15.365
Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.

25:15.365 --> 25:18.005
She drinks some conveniently placed
poisoned wine.

25:18.005 --> 25:21.165
Did she pour it in her ear? I've
heard that's the best way to take
poison.

25:21.165 --> 25:26.165
Kit, sorely wounded but driven by
vengeful fury, stabs Burbage, who
also dies.

25:26.165 --> 25:29.605
Kit then dies as well,
before all order is restored.

25:29.605 --> 25:31.365
Tell them how, Mr Shakespeare.

25:31.365 --> 25:33.765
By the arrival of the Norwegian
army.

25:33.765 --> 25:35.205
ALL BURST OUT LAUGHING

25:35.205 --> 25:37.925
None of which is funny!

25:37.925 --> 25:39.965
Master, I've terrible news.

25:39.965 --> 25:42.405
Christopher Marlowe...is dead.

25:45.725 --> 25:46.685
BELL TOLLS

25:46.685 --> 25:48.765
An unmarked grave.

25:48.765 --> 25:51.965
An unmarked grave in Deptford
is all they give him.

25:51.965 --> 25:54.125
Such a paltry memorial.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.245
And such a paltry end.

25:57.245 --> 26:01.365
I had prepared for him
a truly great death scenario.

26:01.365 --> 26:06.285
But, instead, he is stabbed in the
eye in a brawl in a small room

26:06.285 --> 26:08.805
over the reckoning of a bill.

26:08.805 --> 26:12.965
And such were the number and variety
of his enemies at his end that...

26:13.885 --> 26:16.045
..we four are all that come to
mourn him.

26:17.005 --> 26:19.365
Yes. A bit disappointing, can't
deny.

26:19.365 --> 26:21.005
I was kind of hoping for a
state funeral.

26:21.005 --> 26:23.645
Kit!
Shh-shh. Keep it down, mate.

26:23.645 --> 26:26.005
I'm supposed to be dead.

26:26.005 --> 26:27.285
But...

26:27.285 --> 26:28.965
Aren't you dead?

26:28.965 --> 26:31.045
No! I got three old mates from the
service

26:31.045 --> 26:32.965
to rig a fight using a stage dagger.

26:32.965 --> 26:34.845
It's a plague corpse in the coffin.

26:34.845 --> 26:37.245
But, Kit,
I was supposed to rig your death.

26:37.245 --> 26:38.685
You asked me to help.

26:38.685 --> 26:41.325
Yeah. Yeah, but then you wanted to
use that scene from Hamlet,

26:41.325 --> 26:42.525
and, well...

26:42.525 --> 26:45.085
He didn't want people to think
he'd laughed himself to death.

26:46.845 --> 26:48.525
Still, one good thing...

26:48.525 --> 26:52.485
With Mr Marlowe thought actually
dead, instead of mysteriously
disappeared,

26:52.485 --> 26:55.285
there be no chance
that people will imagine he lived on

26:55.285 --> 26:57.565
and wrote under your name, Mr
Shakespeare.

26:57.565 --> 27:00.405
Pah! People will believe
anything they want to believe.

27:00.405 --> 27:02.805
Ancient Hindu creation legend
believes

27:02.805 --> 27:05.685
that the world is balanced
on the back of a giant tortoise.

27:05.685 --> 27:07.365
Ah-ah-eh-eh.

27:07.365 --> 27:09.565
Perhaps the giant tortoise
wrote your plays.

27:09.565 --> 27:11.405
I wrote my blooming plays!

27:11.405 --> 27:15.045
If you say so, Mr Shakespeare.
Hm! If you say so.

27:19.685 --> 27:21.685
So, the world thinks Marlowe's dead,

27:21.685 --> 27:23.965
but, actually, he's sleeping on
your couch.

27:23.965 --> 27:26.805
Well, you know,
just till he sets up a new identity

27:26.805 --> 27:29.485
and forges a new life for himself.

27:29.485 --> 27:31.965
Well, I can't see him
hurrying to do that, love.

27:31.965 --> 27:34.525
Not with your ale to quaff
and pie to gorge.

27:34.525 --> 27:36.645
Dad, I've been reading Hamlet,

27:36.645 --> 27:40.605
and, actually, I can see why you
think it would make a great tragedy.

27:40.605 --> 27:41.725
Really, daughter?

27:41.725 --> 27:44.005
But I can also see why
they all laughed at it.

27:44.005 --> 27:46.165
Can I be honest?
Of course.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.525
You know, within reason.

27:47.525 --> 27:49.445
You need to keep working on it.

27:49.445 --> 27:51.405
I mean, some of the lines
are almost there.

27:51.405 --> 27:53.845
Like... "To top myself
or not to top myself."

27:53.845 --> 27:55.045
But...

27:55.045 --> 27:58.205
..I just don't think you've quite
got to the heart of Hamlet's agony.

27:58.205 --> 28:00.325
Maybe you're just too comfortable
and content

28:00.325 --> 28:02.365
to get inside that kind of
character.

28:02.365 --> 28:04.885
Well, let's hope it stays that way,
eh?

28:04.885 --> 28:07.085
Because if personal tragedy
is what it takes

28:07.085 --> 28:09.885
to properly interpret Hamlet's
despair,

28:09.885 --> 28:12.485
I hope your Danish play be never
finished.

28:12.485 --> 28:13.765
Me, too. Goodnight.

28:13.765 --> 28:14.845
BOTH: Night.

28:15.965 --> 28:17.405
Well, no matter.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.445
I've got my new comedy written
anyway.

28:19.445 --> 28:22.165
Love's Labour's Licked.

28:22.165 --> 28:25.725
"Lost", love.
We decided on "lost", didn't we?

28:25.725 --> 28:27.005
Oh, yes. That's right.

28:27.005 --> 28:30.165
Susanna thought "licked",
but I said "lost", didn't I?

28:30.165 --> 28:32.205
Love's Labour's Lost.

28:34.445 --> 28:35.685
Or should it be "licked"?
