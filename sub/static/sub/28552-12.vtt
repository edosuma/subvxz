WEBVTT

00:09.798 --> 00:11.391
Dumb earth gravity.

00:11.479 --> 00:15.188
Won't... keep... me... from...

00:15.891 --> 00:17.423
the kids.

00:20.049 --> 00:22.631
OK, first impression
is the only impression.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.266
You gotta nail this.

00:24.446 --> 00:26.268
Greetings children!

00:27.555 --> 00:29.649
Hello!

00:29.884 --> 00:31.938
Oh, hey, didn't see you there.

00:33.496 --> 00:35.744
Simple, sincere.

00:35.831 --> 00:38.595
It's just the most important
moment of your life.

00:43.516 --> 00:46.055
Behold!

00:46.142 --> 00:48.712
The Cartographer's Quill!

00:50.379 --> 00:53.071
A mystical artifact
that sketches maps

00:53.159 --> 00:55.960
leading to the world's
greatest treasures!

01:01.390 --> 01:03.973
Imagine: All the money...

01:04.060 --> 01:05.808
- Daring adventure...
- Yeah!

01:05.895 --> 01:07.759
- Infinite wisdom...
- Mm.

01:07.847 --> 01:12.180
And untold mystery in the
world, literally at your fingertips.

01:12.268 --> 01:14.483
Ooh! You had me at quill!

01:14.657 --> 01:20.022
This could be the most important
moment of our adventuring lives!

01:20.109 --> 01:21.357
Sup, party people!

01:21.444 --> 01:24.084
I'm back in the hizou...
Oh, no...

01:24.172 --> 01:25.754
Knew it was wrong
as soon as I said it.

01:25.842 --> 01:28.582
Sorry, that was terrible.
Can I get a do-over?

Mm...

02:41.949 --> 02:44.134
It's you!
It's really you!

02:44.222 --> 02:46.137
Oh, I cannot believe it!

02:46.225 --> 02:49.141
Oh, look at ya!
Oh! Standing here.

02:49.229 --> 02:52.461
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho,
I thought you were--

02:52.549 --> 02:54.298
Dead? Not yet!

02:54.385 --> 02:56.567
- Where--?
- The moon.

02:57.251 --> 02:59.469
You were on the moon?!

02:59.735 --> 03:02.251
- I searched the moon!
- Not hard enough!

03:02.339 --> 03:06.689
There were mites and aliens and I had
to rebuild the spear with my tooth!

03:06.777 --> 03:10.126
Don't raise your voice at me,
you rapacious rocketeer!

03:10.634 --> 03:14.305
I missed
your Scroogian alliteration.

03:18.472 --> 03:20.305
Lost it in the crash.

03:21.595 --> 03:24.861
Out of rocket parts!
Brilliant!

03:24.948 --> 03:28.876
Leg or no, you're every bit the
woman you were ten years ago.

03:28.964 --> 03:32.147
Out of my way,
old man, where are my...

03:36.985 --> 03:40.010
- Who's the cyborg?
- Is that...?

03:40.097 --> 03:44.196
- It can't be...
- Guys, I think that's your mom.

03:47.338 --> 03:51.573
Huey, Dewey, Louie...
Meet Della Duck.

03:52.211 --> 03:53.855
I'm part robot!

03:53.943 --> 03:55.321
I knew it!

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:04.110 --> 04:07.016
Wait, Huey, Dewey, and Louie?
No, no, no...

04:07.104 --> 04:10.387
Their names were supposed to be
Jet, Turbo, and Rebel!

04:10.579 --> 04:14.071
- I coulda been Turbo?!
- I told Donald.

04:14.231 --> 04:16.480
I wrote it down in case
no one could understand him.

04:16.567 --> 04:19.470
I coulda been Turbo?!

04:19.558 --> 04:22.841
Hi, Huey-slash-Jet here.

04:23.227 --> 04:24.921
How did you survive
in a barren wasteland?

04:25.008 --> 04:26.397
Have you adjusted
to our gravity?

04:26.485 --> 04:28.791
Did you make any customized
modifications to your leg?

04:28.879 --> 04:31.165
Sheer determination
to get back to you.

04:31.253 --> 04:32.343
Kinda. And no.

04:32.431 --> 04:34.798
Because as Junior Woodchuck
Rule 42 states:

04:34.885 --> 04:38.135
Build things right the first
time and they won't need modification.

04:38.223 --> 04:40.218
You really are my mom!

04:40.306 --> 04:44.001
- Get in here, Rebel!
- Nope. I'm not buying.

04:44.089 --> 04:46.098
This has to be a trick,
or a curse

04:46.186 --> 04:48.145
from Magica, or a
parallel universe,

04:48.232 --> 04:50.804
or... or...

04:56.666 --> 04:57.647
Mom!

04:57.735 --> 04:59.001
Mm-hm...

05:05.562 --> 05:09.264
My heart!
It's too full!

05:15.731 --> 05:18.999
Wow, she is amazing.

05:20.065 --> 05:21.431
Ah...

05:22.318 --> 05:23.899
And... now I'm done.

05:23.987 --> 05:26.402
Thanks...
Agent 22?!

05:26.484 --> 05:27.674
You're the housekeeper now?

05:27.762 --> 05:28.786
Where's Duckworth?

05:28.874 --> 05:30.386
He's moved on.

05:31.058 --> 05:32.538
Though sadly not far enough.

05:32.849 --> 05:36.551
The underworld has
fewer cobwebs to tend to.

05:39.731 --> 05:41.475
You've been gone awhile, lass.

05:41.639 --> 05:43.148
A lot has changed.

05:43.421 --> 05:44.997
Is it true that parents
pick favorites?

05:45.085 --> 05:46.210
Which one of us is yours?

05:46.298 --> 05:48.295
Did you suffer any side effects
from the cosmic storm?

05:48.382 --> 05:49.701
Ooh! How many fingers
am I holding up?

05:49.788 --> 05:51.645
- Wait, are you moving in?
- Back to favorites.

05:51.733 --> 05:54.526
- It's ol' Turbo, right?
- I'm Webby!

05:54.613 --> 05:57.090
All right,
that's enough for today.

05:57.178 --> 06:00.965
Your mum must be tired...
after conquering the moon!

06:02.120 --> 06:03.202
Let her rest.

06:03.290 --> 06:04.715
Who can rest
when there's so much

06:04.803 --> 06:06.589
lost time to make up for?!

06:07.225 --> 06:09.905
I've got my boys!

06:12.230 --> 06:14.279
My brother...

06:14.499 --> 06:16.147
Wait, where's Donald?

06:16.234 --> 06:18.460
He's off on a relaxing
remote vacation.

06:21.624 --> 06:24.075
Oh, instead of welcoming back
his sister.

06:24.163 --> 06:25.523
Must be nice.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.317
Boys, I don't know what to say,

06:28.405 --> 06:32.639
except I'm so sorry for ever
stepping foot on that rocket.

06:32.733 --> 06:35.900
I never meant to leave you,
or miss your first steps,

06:35.987 --> 06:37.235
or potty training...

06:37.322 --> 06:39.913
Wait, you are
potty trained, right?

06:40.999 --> 06:43.780
What I'm trying to say is,
for a decade,

06:43.991 --> 06:46.678
I fought every day
to get back to this family,

06:46.819 --> 06:49.421
and I will fight every day
to be a part of it.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.280
If you'll have me?

06:51.503 --> 06:53.651
- I--
- Of course!

06:53.738 --> 06:55.805
We're a family again!

06:56.474 --> 06:58.423
I missed you so much,

06:58.510 --> 06:59.919
you deserve
to have the best mom,

07:00.007 --> 07:01.754
and I'm going to be
the best mom.

07:01.842 --> 07:03.061
Starting right now.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.829
- Who wants cake?
- Yeah!

07:04.916 --> 07:06.749
To the kitchen!

07:08.486 --> 07:10.435
Which is apparently
over here now!

07:10.522 --> 07:12.021
Did you remodel?

07:25.804 --> 07:28.052
Ooh!

07:30.542 --> 07:32.008
Perfect!

07:33.678 --> 07:36.427
Congratulations
Birthday Valentine!

07:36.514 --> 07:38.796
Merry Flag Day Just Because!

07:38.883 --> 07:42.300
Happy International Talk Like
A Pirate Arrrbor Day!

07:42.420 --> 07:45.528
- I missed so many
life achievements and holidays,

07:45.616 --> 07:47.939
I'm gonna make up for them
all tonight.

07:49.327 --> 07:50.974
I didn't know what dessert
was your favorite,

07:51.061 --> 07:52.074
so, I made all of them!

07:52.162 --> 07:54.192
My favorite dessert
is all of them!

07:54.280 --> 07:56.132
Good instincts, Mom!

07:57.366 --> 07:59.050
Well, I don't normally
have nighttime sugars,

07:59.137 --> 08:02.491
but since this is all
the special occasions.

08:03.074 --> 08:05.757
You made flan?!

08:05.844 --> 08:08.780
'Cause I'm a flan-tastic mom!

08:08.975 --> 08:13.866
Oh, my gosh,
our mom is hilarious!

08:17.722 --> 08:22.801
Now, it is my honor to present
you with a true Della-cacy...

08:22.889 --> 08:24.842
How does she Dewey it?!

08:24.929 --> 08:27.444
- H'boy, now there's two of them.
- Behold!

08:27.532 --> 08:29.113
My classic firework cake!

08:29.201 --> 08:30.349
It's like a regular cake,

08:30.437 --> 08:31.944
but it's loaded with
Fizzy Rocks!

08:32.070 --> 08:34.519
I haven't seen these in forever!

08:34.606 --> 08:36.354
That's because
after all the lawsuits

08:36.441 --> 08:38.616
the government claimed
they were unsafe to eat.

08:38.889 --> 08:41.131
That sounds like a challenge!

08:41.220 --> 08:43.205
- Yeah, do it!
- Again, it's incredibly unsafe.

08:43.293 --> 08:44.659
Every time.

08:46.418 --> 08:50.453
Mom, look!
I'm shifting into Turbo!

08:55.760 --> 08:58.461
Best Mother ever...

09:03.802 --> 09:07.003
This is... going so well.

09:09.641 --> 09:10.827
It's gonna be OK.

09:10.915 --> 09:14.498
Oh, my insides are on fire...

09:14.622 --> 09:16.571
With love for my mom!

09:20.819 --> 09:23.368
Hey, I know what'll make
that belly feel better.

09:23.455 --> 09:27.647
A bedtime story! Because a good mom
knows how to sooth her sick kid.

09:27.772 --> 09:30.028
Ever heard the one about
"The Princess and the Peacock?"

09:30.116 --> 09:32.725
Uh, yeah.
A long time ago I think.

09:33.061 --> 09:34.561
Oh... right.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.749
Of course.
Guess it is a little baby-ish.

09:37.836 --> 09:39.046
Oh, no, but, um--

09:39.134 --> 09:41.522
You're never too old
for a fairytale!

09:41.655 --> 09:44.589
No, Rebel...
I mean, Louie is right.

09:44.676 --> 09:45.866
You're all grown up now.

09:45.967 --> 09:48.726
You're ready for a real-life
grownup story.

09:48.813 --> 09:51.062
- Starring, yours truly!
- Yeah!

09:55.019 --> 09:56.701
The place: El Dorado.

09:56.788 --> 09:58.569
The time: when I was your age.

09:58.656 --> 10:02.340
The legend: the horror
known as The Gilded Man.

10:02.427 --> 10:05.543
The Aztec android was meant
to protect the people,

10:05.630 --> 10:08.413
but he blew a fuse
and mangled them instead.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.788
Metal gnawed through flesh,

10:11.913 --> 10:13.584
leaving a trail of bodies

10:13.671 --> 10:16.692
until the golden city
was stained blood red.

10:16.780 --> 10:20.231
I grabbed a wrench, crawled
inside the gold-minted monster,

10:20.319 --> 10:22.512
and hacked away
at his clockwork innards,

10:22.600 --> 10:24.887
tearing him apart
from the inside,

10:24.975 --> 10:27.899
piece-by-piece
with reckless abandon.

10:27.986 --> 10:29.133
Wham!

10:29.241 --> 10:32.537
He let out a
ghastly rusted shriek...

10:34.249 --> 10:38.609
Until, finally, his gory gears
turned their last.

10:38.991 --> 10:42.061
Some say that shriek
was a death knell.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.184
Others say it was a promise.

10:44.272 --> 10:49.987
To rebuild and seek vengeance on the
one who defeated him and her family.

10:50.074 --> 10:52.348
Pretty sure we stuffed him
in the garage.

10:52.436 --> 10:54.076
Well, goodnight!

10:55.713 --> 10:57.128
Maybe we should leave
the lights on,

10:57.215 --> 10:59.210
you know, just in case...

11:10.147 --> 11:12.850
Good morning,
my sleepy sunshine's.

11:16.585 --> 11:19.395
Can you believe Scrooge
didn't want me to have these?

11:19.483 --> 11:21.486
- What?
- I know, right?

11:21.803 --> 11:24.455
Thankfully, I hid a whole case
in my old secret stash.

11:24.542 --> 11:26.842
Customized them just for you.

11:29.296 --> 11:30.694
Heads up!

11:30.782 --> 11:31.840
Ahh!

11:33.217 --> 11:35.926
First order of business,
shredding the nar.

11:36.014 --> 11:38.882
Because a good mom knows
how to spice up the ordinary.

11:41.559 --> 11:43.038
Observe.

11:43.159 --> 11:45.241
Whoo!

11:45.647 --> 11:48.038
She is the best person alive.

11:48.132 --> 11:50.504
So, who wants to go first?

11:53.471 --> 11:55.147
Maybe sit this round out, Turbo.

11:55.288 --> 11:57.577
Jet? Ah, I mean Huey.

11:57.665 --> 11:59.092
Sorry, I'll get it.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.842
Huey has a hat,
and the hue is red.

12:02.046 --> 12:04.419
Junior Woodchuck Rule 84:

12:04.507 --> 12:07.850
Safety doesn't happen
by accident!

12:10.121 --> 12:14.928
So, the first jump is at a 20
degree angle, then you kick flip...

12:26.070 --> 12:28.719
If you do that last part
exactly right, you won't die.

12:28.806 --> 12:30.922
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

12:31.009 --> 12:32.842
Oh, this oughta be rich.

12:43.116 --> 12:45.991
I flew too close to the sun!

12:46.302 --> 12:47.850
You did great.

12:48.092 --> 12:50.717
And I bet you'll scream
way less next time.

12:50.805 --> 12:52.983
Whose is this?

12:53.303 --> 12:56.161
Oh...
Well, that's my...

12:56.249 --> 12:57.989
Son's shield!

12:58.077 --> 12:59.350
Sons' shield.

12:59.437 --> 13:02.530
Plural possessive
because it's all of ours.

13:02.624 --> 13:05.561
We three share the blame.

13:07.319 --> 13:08.500
Triplets, amirite...?

13:14.052 --> 13:16.300
Here, Mrs. B,
let us help you.

13:16.387 --> 13:17.602
I'll go get the broom.

13:19.057 --> 13:20.342
And a bucket.

13:24.366 --> 13:26.243
Boys, to your rooms.

13:26.819 --> 13:28.030
I'll handle this.

13:28.147 --> 13:29.669
After all,
I'm used to cleaning up

13:29.757 --> 13:31.133
after children, dear.

13:47.485 --> 13:49.100
You did a great job, Donald.

13:49.187 --> 13:51.397
You earned that vacation.

13:56.327 --> 13:57.575
I'll take it from here.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.124
Me and the boys
and Scrooge and...

14:00.531 --> 14:02.913
- Who is this?
- Hey.

14:03.327 --> 14:05.246
Thought I'd come over
to introduce myself.

14:05.334 --> 14:07.100
I'm Launchpad.
I'm a pilot.

14:07.366 --> 14:09.669
Uh-uh. No way, buddy.

14:09.757 --> 14:12.490
I know I was gone for a while,
but I will not be replaced!

14:12.577 --> 14:14.171
Where's Scrooge?

14:14.264 --> 14:16.645
Nothing can stop Della Duck!

14:17.819 --> 14:19.664
Nice to meet you!

14:19.967 --> 14:21.332
I'm sorry, Mr. McDuck,

14:21.419 --> 14:24.101
but I think Della is struggling
to adjust to this new life.

14:24.389 --> 14:26.937
Come now, Beakley,
she's only just arrived.

14:27.024 --> 14:28.639
So, she's not
the best with cooking,

14:28.726 --> 14:31.304
or age-appropriate stories,
or child endangerment.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.310
But nobody's perfect.

14:33.454 --> 14:35.437
She's trying
and that's what matters.

14:35.525 --> 14:37.194
Junior Woodchuck Rule Three:

14:37.282 --> 14:39.140
No matter how hard things get,

14:39.228 --> 14:41.632
never give up
on a fellow Woodchuck.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.251
Sorry, I still can't
hear that great.

14:43.345 --> 14:45.341
Also, she's our mom!

14:46.110 --> 14:48.693
- Right, Louie?
- Right?

14:48.826 --> 14:50.192
Well...

14:53.493 --> 14:54.991
Hey, look, don't get me wrong,

14:55.079 --> 14:57.353
of course,
I'm happy to have Mom back.

14:58.089 --> 14:59.212
But?

14:59.352 --> 15:01.985
But, I dunno.
It's probably my fault.

15:02.181 --> 15:06.517
I've gone so long without a mom, I guess
I don't really know how to have one.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.838
That's because she's not a mom.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.686
Not yet, anyway.
She's been gone for so long.

15:15.773 --> 15:18.089
You've got to give her time
to figure out who she is,

15:18.269 --> 15:21.303
and how she fits
into this family.

15:23.454 --> 15:26.540
I was gone for a decade
and everyone was fine.

15:26.821 --> 15:31.669
I'm home for ten hours and now my kids
are all sick, injured, and terrified.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.173
I miss fighting monsters.

15:34.353 --> 15:36.829
You guys make it easy
to know what to do.

15:37.195 --> 15:38.718
I fought you, Gilded Man!

15:38.806 --> 15:40.778
And Moon Mites,
and the abyss of space,

15:40.865 --> 15:43.751
and every last odd
to get back to my kids, and...

15:44.084 --> 15:46.432
I'm blowing it.

15:46.735 --> 15:49.186
Who do I have to fight
to be a part of this family?!

16:01.719 --> 16:03.300
Ah, phooey.

16:03.681 --> 16:07.337
Hey, listen, so I know
you're all about seeking revenge

16:07.425 --> 16:09.374
against the entire family
of the person who destroyed you,

16:09.461 --> 16:12.657
but any chance
you'd seek a truce instead?

16:16.133 --> 16:18.689
Fine!
You want a fight, you got one.

16:23.975 --> 16:25.256
Oh, this is it!

16:25.343 --> 16:26.657
I'm good at this.

16:26.744 --> 16:28.559
I'll beat you,
save the family

16:28.646 --> 16:29.794
and prove my worth!

16:29.881 --> 16:31.629
Nothing can stop Della Duck!

16:31.716 --> 16:35.784
What in dismal downs
is going on in here?!

16:37.154 --> 16:39.755
I really need to start
locking this door.

16:42.260 --> 16:46.095
Don't worry, Uncle Scrooge, I
got everything under control. Ah!

16:50.601 --> 16:52.082
What's with all the old junk?

16:52.169 --> 16:53.751
Where's the Deus Excalibur,

16:53.838 --> 16:55.186
or the Ferryman's Flame, or...

16:55.273 --> 16:58.155
We, kinda, sorta used
a lot of that stuff already.

17:02.001 --> 17:04.862
Come on,
you golden-geared gargantuan!

17:27.605 --> 17:29.486
OK, here's the plan:
I'll stall him,

17:29.573 --> 17:32.031
you go get the kids so they can
see me save them from this monster

17:32.118 --> 17:33.958
and prove I'm a good mom.

17:34.045 --> 17:35.843
What idiot said
you weren't a good mom?

17:35.931 --> 17:37.499
You.
Like, five minutes ago.

17:37.587 --> 17:39.897
Oh... Lass, you've only
been here for a day.

17:39.984 --> 17:42.700
You can't force a relationship with
your kids just through monster fighting.

17:42.787 --> 17:46.221
You're right! We should probably
go treasure hunting, too.

18:11.015 --> 18:13.248
Our nightmares are real!

18:20.791 --> 18:23.755
Ha! Only the one true
King of England

18:23.843 --> 18:25.476
can wield that sword!

18:27.264 --> 18:28.697
Oh, no.

18:35.179 --> 18:36.527
Granny!

18:36.798 --> 18:39.356
You just knocked out
the wrong old lady!

18:48.386 --> 18:49.967
Mom?!

18:50.054 --> 18:52.303
Hi, kids!
I'm saving you!

18:53.564 --> 18:55.105
Time to take
this robotic recluse

18:55.192 --> 18:56.540
down from the inside!

18:56.627 --> 18:59.017
Oh, c'mon!

18:59.673 --> 19:02.134
Why isn't this working?!
It worked before.

19:02.689 --> 19:06.594
That was ages ago. You've
grown, things are different now.

19:22.353 --> 19:24.053
Hey, it worked!

19:27.892 --> 19:30.220
It hates noise!

19:30.394 --> 19:32.643
I got a really loud idea.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.470
Huey, get some tape!

19:48.279 --> 19:50.412
Mom, catch!

20:08.599 --> 20:11.382
Louie, look out!

20:39.330 --> 20:40.963
Thanks, Mom.

20:45.503 --> 20:46.969
Hey, guys.

20:55.759 --> 20:57.261
How did you get free?

20:57.348 --> 21:00.064
Good parenting is about
coping with change

21:00.151 --> 21:02.833
and adapting
to unforeseen challenges.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.400
She adapted.

21:04.578 --> 21:07.429
One day in
and you're learning already.

21:10.094 --> 21:13.368
Huey, Dewey, Louie.

21:13.470 --> 21:17.281
I know you're not used to having a
mom, and I'm not used to being one,

21:17.368 --> 21:20.704
but I'll figure it
out as we go along, in time.

21:20.911 --> 21:22.477
We all will.

21:24.446 --> 21:27.256
So, what do you guys want to do?

21:27.344 --> 21:28.578
- Go find a treasure!
- Discover a hidden temple!

21:28.665 --> 21:29.780
Anything! Everything!

21:29.868 --> 21:31.429
Well, let's get started.

21:34.666 --> 21:38.268
Man, Donald sure is missing out
on some quality family bonding.

21:48.323 --> 21:50.656
I come in peace.

21:51.368 --> 21:53.083
I'm sorry, what?

21:53.224 --> 21:55.306
I literally have no idea
what he said.

21:56.376 --> 21:58.181
Seize him.

22:00.204 --> 22:02.361
