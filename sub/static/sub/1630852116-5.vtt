WEBVTT

02:02.080 --> 02:03.081
Here you are, ma'am.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.292
Thank you.

02:08.878 --> 02:09.712
Pardon me.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.800
You're pretty buff.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.051
Thanks.

02:15.718 --> 02:17.428
Want to have some fun?

02:18.012 --> 02:19.848
My hotel is right there.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.643
I appreciate the offer…

02:25.311 --> 02:26.855
but I'm still on the clock.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.524
Such a serious boy. How sweet.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.192
See you around.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.236
Nice doing business with you, ma'am.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.531
What's wrong?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.450
It's nothing.

02:52.130 --> 02:54.549
Nice doing business with you, ma'am.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.680
What bad timing.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.774
Gladiator!

03:13.902 --> 03:15.445
That's as far as you go, sneak thief.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.281
What bad timing!

03:19.908 --> 03:21.451
You've done it now!

03:22.035 --> 03:25.455
I'm the one who dragged you
outta Mama's cunt, asshole!

03:26.164 --> 03:28.875
Not that fucked-up true story again.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.345
You're batshit crazy, my brother.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.724
You fucking bastard!

04:13.503 --> 04:15.338
If you're gonna fight, then make it pay.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.383
That's right.
Just like The Heat taught us.

04:23.554 --> 04:24.472
What's this about?

04:25.056 --> 04:25.974
This is bad timing.

04:26.057 --> 04:26.975
Yeah.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.302
That's the best he could do?

05:06.597 --> 05:07.974
Thanks for coming.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.101
I'm glad to have you here.

05:10.184 --> 05:13.104
Of course I came.
I was waiting for your call.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.064
How many years has it been?

05:15.565 --> 05:18.609
I lost track. Chicago sure has changed.

05:19.444 --> 05:23.698
My baby chick has spread her wings.
I've heard the rumors even here.

05:24.198 --> 05:26.367
You should come to the West Coast.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.119
That place isn't my style.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.662
Aw, man.

05:29.746 --> 05:33.291
I think I've come to the wrong place.

05:33.875 --> 05:38.004
Don't you worry.
This is simply a facade, right?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.299
By the way, what's your name?

05:42.675 --> 05:43.593
I'm Johnny.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.723
If you're going to hide,
the best place is somewhere busy.

05:49.390 --> 05:52.310
And the best kind of busy place
is somewhere that makes money.

05:52.393 --> 05:56.689
The best places have always been
cleaners, garbage collection centers,

05:56.773 --> 05:58.316
and butcher shops.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.193
How come?

06:00.276 --> 06:03.446
Nobody likes places that are filthy.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.031
Everyone stays away.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.324
Really?

06:06.407 --> 06:11.370
And picky parole officers like it
because it's steady work for their wards.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.415
And for those who haven't worked
in the underworld for years,

06:14.499 --> 06:16.918
it's a helpful way to make a living.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.629
Don't you dare touch that!

06:20.755 --> 06:22.381
The electric shock could be deadly.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.717
That doesn't bother me.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.552
I'm not worried about you.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.889
I'm worried that machine
could short out from your power.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.392
When did you tell him?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.477
Tell him what?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.229
About my power.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.355
I never told him.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.275
In fact,
I didn't even tell him you were coming.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.736
Then how did he know?

06:43.820 --> 06:46.322
That's what makes him The Heat.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.573
Seriously?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.209
These all bring back memories.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.837
It was a golden age for villains.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.966
"Legendary supervillain, The Heat."

07:05.049 --> 07:05.883
That's right.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.263
And Chicago was controlled
by the underworld gangs.

07:10.972 --> 07:14.142
It's where the first supervillains
came into existence.

07:14.851 --> 07:19.397
In 1927,
that bastard Thompson was elected mayor.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.566
He became connected with

07:21.649 --> 07:25.862
the gang called the Chicago Outfit
via a Cicero nightclub.

07:25.945 --> 07:30.533
That was the start of
Al Capone's control of the underworld.

07:31.200 --> 07:35.913
In the global financial crisis of 1929,
Chicago went deep into debt.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.626
Then after
the St. Valentine's Day Massacre,

07:40.710 --> 07:44.255
gangs led by the likes of Tony Accardo

07:44.797 --> 07:47.300
and Sam Giancana ruled the city

07:47.383 --> 07:49.552
from the '40s to the '70s.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.555
It was the legendary
Chicago Villain Brothers,

07:53.222 --> 07:56.934
who sometimes worked alongside
those gangs and sometimes opposed them,

07:57.768 --> 08:00.271
who built the golden era.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.899
Sounds like the damn Blues Brothers.

08:02.982 --> 08:06.277
And Chicago's first
supervillain was The Heat.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.155
Refusing to partner with those gangs,

08:09.238 --> 08:12.783
he gathered together villains
who were in similar circumstances.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.830
Those are yours, aren't they?
I saw them on that cable show.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.415
You mean Crime History?

08:19.999 --> 08:23.544
Yeah, that's right. These things
could melt any steel safe around, right?

08:24.253 --> 08:25.713
They're Heat Canisters.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.634
They instantly fire a heat ray
hotter than a blast furnace.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.844
They were my trustworthy partners.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.096
They don't work now though.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.057
You don't have superpowers?

08:38.392 --> 08:41.896
In that era, supervillains didn’t need
that kind of thing.

08:42.855 --> 08:46.108
What was needed was to be
at the right place at the right time.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.945
That's the key to being a good villain.

08:49.987 --> 08:55.826
On TV, the legend is
that you were never once caught.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.620
But you were caught tons of times.

08:58.287 --> 09:00.957
People only believe what they want to see,

09:01.040 --> 09:04.752
what they want to read,
and what they want to hear.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.546
In other words,

09:06.629 --> 09:10.007
there's no need
for the legend of The Heat to be true.

09:10.967 --> 09:15.221
The Heat is a kind of ideal
that other villains have constructed.

09:16.055 --> 09:16.931
Therefore,

09:17.014 --> 09:21.185
the key to being successful
is to take advantage of that ideal.

09:21.269 --> 09:24.355
As a supervillain,
that is the destiny I must bear.

09:24.438 --> 09:27.650
Destiny? Sounds more like
lies about your past.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.901
Johnny!

09:28.985 --> 09:32.863
Villains don't work for anyone.
I work for myself.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.490
I do it in order to live free.

09:35.199 --> 09:39.287
I face real dangers head-on.
They ain't no lies.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.710
That pride of yours isn't worth a cent.

09:59.890 --> 10:01.392
You okay?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.769
Sorry about this.

10:04.353 --> 10:05.563
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

10:10.818 --> 10:11.777
This is the place.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.196
The other members are already here.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.617
Welcome to the gangster city of Chicago.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.250
Let me introduce you. This is Kasey-Anne.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.962
And this guy is…

10:30.588 --> 10:31.422
I'm Johnny.

10:31.505 --> 10:34.216
Oh, that's right. Johnny.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.553
You're the one with
that freaking amazing power, right?

10:38.137 --> 10:41.057
I heard a rumor
that you're the key to this.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.018
Nice to meet you.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.398
Thank you for coming, everyone. Now then…

10:58.449 --> 10:59.742
Moving along…

11:00.951 --> 11:04.205
As you all know, recently in the US,

11:04.288 --> 11:07.083
due to the appearance and rise of

11:07.166 --> 11:09.710
the superhero organization,
The Union of Justice,

11:09.794 --> 11:14.048
there's been an explosion in
the number of heroes with superpowers.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.968
Due to this, business for us
has improved as well.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.429
What's more, the Network was formed.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.472
Exactly.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.599
The Network was formed

11:23.682 --> 11:28.312
to overcome the grave situation
that villains faced.

11:28.396 --> 11:33.692
However, to villains like us
who don't want to be involved with them,

11:33.776 --> 11:36.362
they're a stifling presence.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.907
I'll admit, those guys are pretty fishy.

11:39.990 --> 11:44.120
They get a cut when all they do is
make the plans for the members to follow.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.331
And if it fails,
it's us guys who get caught.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.584
It doesn't hurt the Network at all.
We're treated like pawns.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.171
What's more, for Supermax Prison,

11:54.255 --> 11:56.799
the capture of villains like us

11:56.882 --> 12:00.136
is an excuse for them
to keep their business running.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.095
That ticks me off.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.222
Those restraint vests stink too.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.516
Especially when the last guy had bad BO.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.396
For sure. It's not easy
to make it in this world now.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.232
So what's this nice job you've got?

12:13.315 --> 12:14.608
Oh, that's right.

12:14.692 --> 12:18.737
I'd like to know why
you've gathered obscure villains like us.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.866
What? Who you callin' obscure, slim!

12:21.949 --> 12:23.993
We're the great Diesel Brothers, pal!

12:24.994 --> 12:26.495
Sorry.

12:26.579 --> 12:29.582
It just seems to me
that one of the requirements

12:29.665 --> 12:33.002
for being called here
is that you're obscure enough

12:33.085 --> 12:34.920
not to be mixed up with the Network.

12:36.088 --> 12:36.922
Right?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.507
-What?
-What?

12:39.008 --> 12:39.884
That's right.

12:41.010 --> 12:42.303
You're pretty sharp.

12:42.386 --> 12:45.681
Which means that
this is one heck of a job.

12:45.764 --> 12:46.891
What do you mean?

12:46.974 --> 12:49.602
It's a job that even
the Network won't touch.

12:49.685 --> 12:53.606
In fact, they don't even
want people to know about it, boy.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.732
What?

12:54.815 --> 12:59.570
Which means even an obscure guy
like you is qualified to participate, boy.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.822
What the fuck did you just say?

13:01.906 --> 13:03.115
Stop it, Johnny!

13:04.241 --> 13:07.411
And your only power is
electric shock, huh?

13:08.245 --> 13:09.788
Why, you bastard!

13:09.872 --> 13:12.625
Johnny! Cut it out, would you!

13:15.878 --> 13:17.004
Fine.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.631
Continue, Heat.

13:21.592 --> 13:23.719
As just mentioned,

13:23.802 --> 13:27.473
one requirement is
that you're not mixed up with the Network.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.016
But that's not all.

13:29.642 --> 13:34.313
All of the supervillains gathered here
have a special power

13:34.396 --> 13:39.527
that makes them each essential
for their unique role in this plan

13:39.610 --> 13:41.403
that only they can play.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.657
Except for your pathetic electric shock.

13:44.740 --> 13:45.616
You…

13:45.699 --> 13:47.243
Cut it out, you two!

13:48.577 --> 13:49.662
Johnny!

13:50.287 --> 13:51.288
I've had it with you!

14:07.429 --> 14:10.975
And what the fuck can you do?

14:16.897 --> 14:18.023
Son of a bitch!

14:21.235 --> 14:24.446
I'm The Ghost, and this is my power.

14:25.364 --> 14:26.282
Ghost?

14:27.658 --> 14:32.288
I'm a man who has no presence,
as if he were a ghost.

14:32.955 --> 14:37.209
I can go from anywhere to anywhere,
passing through anything.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.919
I'm a phantom.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.255
After my power was awakened,

14:41.338 --> 14:45.217
I soon realized
that since I could go anywhere,

14:45.301 --> 14:46.594
I belonged nowhere.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.472
No matter who I joined up with,
since I had no presence,

14:50.556 --> 14:52.808
I would merely be used.

14:53.309 --> 14:57.563
So I decided
that I would use them as well.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.857
But one time,

15:00.691 --> 15:05.738
it was discovered that while I was
working with both the racist skinheads

15:05.821 --> 15:09.825
and ecoterrorists,
I was scamming both of them.

15:16.999 --> 15:21.253
If you want to be part of a cult,
then be part of our cult.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.755
The Villain Brothers.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.801
When Carmine let me into
that group of supervillains,

15:27.885 --> 15:33.307
I fortunately ended up not having to read
either Mein Kampf or Silent Spring.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.779
Magnificent!

15:48.739 --> 15:51.241
That was an excellent display
of your power.

15:52.326 --> 15:56.205
But that's not all that you're capable of.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.289
Isn't that right?

15:58.290 --> 15:59.124
Yeah.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.505
That ability of yours
is exactly what we need right now.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.007
How about it, Johnny?

16:07.091 --> 16:08.509
You got it.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.260
Nice, Johnny.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.221
I look forward to working with you.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.472
Yeah.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.516
Okay, let's get started.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.560
-You're good too, right, Josh?
-Yep.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.396
For this job, we'll…

16:35.411 --> 16:37.454
Moving along…

16:37.538 --> 16:41.917
This mission is made up of two main parts.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.295
You could say
there's a first and second half.

16:45.879 --> 16:49.550
Of course, the second half
is the actual job.

16:50.259 --> 16:55.931
But the first job is naturally
an essential and dangerous mission.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.850
Enough of the lecturing!

16:57.933 --> 16:59.893
Yeah! Hurry up and tell us!

17:00.477 --> 17:03.147
Okay. The first mission is

17:03.230 --> 17:08.193
to rescue a member of the team
who's necessary for the final mission.

17:08.277 --> 17:09.361
Rescue?

17:09.945 --> 17:15.159
Yes. While on vacation in Florida,
he was enjoying a little larceny,

17:15.242 --> 17:17.911
when he was unfortunately caught
by a superhero.

17:17.995 --> 17:20.122
What? Who is this loser?

17:21.081 --> 17:22.374
TK.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.335
TK? You mean TK McCabe?

17:25.419 --> 17:29.089
TK was carrying out a splendid plan
to steal from a warehouse

17:29.173 --> 17:32.134
that is connected to
a luxury hotel in Florida

17:32.217 --> 17:35.345
where there are
relatively few superheroes.

17:35.929 --> 17:41.393
Unfortunately, the superhero Gladiator was
vacationing in Florida at the same time.

17:41.935 --> 17:44.730
Of all people, Gladiator!

18:11.840 --> 18:15.135
TK was arrested and locked up,

18:15.219 --> 18:18.639
and is scheduled to be escorted
to prison via military plane.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.059
If he ends up detained in Supermax Prison,

18:22.142 --> 18:26.105
he'll have to spend a maximum
of ten years locked away.

18:27.272 --> 18:31.860
Our first mission is to safely rescue TK.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.112
Hey, come on!

18:33.195 --> 18:37.533
Why do we gotta save this bumbler's ass
'cause he went and got himself caught?

18:37.616 --> 18:40.327
Damn right! Generosity has its limits!

18:40.410 --> 18:42.830
Is he really so absolutely necessary?

18:42.913 --> 18:46.959
Yes. He is an important part
necessary for the completion of this plan.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.211
That guy?

18:49.294 --> 18:52.214
I'll admit, his power would be helpful.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.967
After assembling the necessary members,

18:55.467 --> 18:59.680
we'll prepare to obtain
the other necessary part.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.681
What do you mean?

19:01.849 --> 19:02.891
Now, now.

19:03.433 --> 19:07.396
Why don't you just look
at what comes next as a nice surprise?

19:07.479 --> 19:08.981
There you go lecturing again.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.108
Florida?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.193
I like it.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.821
Oh, well. I guess we'll go get him.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.533
I don't mind going to Florida,

19:19.616 --> 19:24.037
but I bet we'll need a ton of money
to prep for this mission, right?

19:24.913 --> 19:26.790
Don't worry about that either.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.209
The client has already sent it.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.589
A sugar daddy? This is looking good.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.216
Is that client a Romanian?

19:37.843 --> 19:40.596
How did you know? Did you read my mind?

19:40.679 --> 19:43.557
I don't need to go to
that kind of trouble.

19:44.975 --> 19:46.393
I mean, look at this.

19:46.977 --> 19:49.730
It's so unlike you to drink pálinka.

19:49.813 --> 19:50.898
It was a gift, right?

19:52.149 --> 19:53.901
You're as sharp as ever.

19:55.485 --> 20:00.616
As you know, the US villain world
is going through a slump.

20:01.700 --> 20:05.871
So I traveled far, to Eastern Europe,
outside of the clutches of superheroes

20:05.954 --> 20:08.498
in order to find work.

20:08.582 --> 20:13.545
I sold this plan to a certain bigwig
who's in seclusion in Romania.

20:14.713 --> 20:20.510
I was already quite certain
that this bigwig would very much want

20:20.594 --> 20:23.513
for this mission to be realized. Then…

20:24.514 --> 20:26.808
he went for it, exactly as expected.

20:28.810 --> 20:29.686
At any rate,

20:30.270 --> 20:33.190
we have ample funds
to prepare for this mission.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.778
And we're about to
put the plan into action.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.113
I like it.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.448
Oh, well.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.700
This is nice timing.

20:44.826 --> 20:49.748
Also, quite fortunately,
Mr. Matts, The Bastard,

20:49.831 --> 20:53.835
is currently handing over his business
to his younger subordinate.

20:53.919 --> 20:56.088
So the Network's on hiatus?

20:56.588 --> 21:01.510
Right. The fees that supervillains
normally have to pay

21:01.593 --> 21:05.430
according to the Network's rules,
won't have to be.

21:06.014 --> 21:10.143
We can circumvent the Network. I like it.

21:10.227 --> 21:14.606
Come to think of it, a guard at Supermax
mentioned something about that.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.817
This truly is good timing.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.863
We'll start by rescuing
the first necessary part, TK.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.032
As for what comes next,

21:24.116 --> 21:27.327
I'll explain it all to you
after he's been rescued.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.288
But don't you worry.

21:29.371 --> 21:31.373
If this plan succeeds,

21:31.456 --> 21:34.751
each of you here will become millionaires.

21:37.838 --> 21:44.761
This job could become
the biggest ever in my 75 years.

21:45.512 --> 21:49.099
If it succeeds, the front page
of the newspaper that reports it

21:49.182 --> 21:55.063
will be displayed in a place of honor
and proudly shine as a new legend.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.524
A new legend?

21:58.358 --> 22:02.612
All the articles displayed here
are of when you got arrested.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.743
It better not be an article
of us getting arrested along with you.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.036
That's for sure.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.037
Agreed.

22:11.872 --> 22:12.914
Darn you people!

22:12.998 --> 22:16.752
It doesn't matter
as long as you're on the front page!

22:16.835 --> 22:18.962
Listen! Being a legend means…

22:25.635 --> 22:27.262
Moving along…

22:27.346 --> 22:28.638
Cheers!

22:28.722 --> 22:30.640
-Yeah!
-Cheers!

24:05.360 --> 24:10.365
