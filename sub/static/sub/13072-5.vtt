04:58.918 --> 05:00.369
It was winter break.

05:00.404 --> 05:02.734
Um... my best friend, Ashley,

05:02.769 --> 05:04.717
was having a party, but...

05:05.539 --> 05:06.738
there was a snowstorm on the way.

I'd get caught in it.

10:47.396 --> 10:48.502

maintain visual contact with him

10:53.185 --> 10:55.135

10:57.446 --> 10:59.026

23:47.891 --> 23:49.378
All right.

23:49.413 --> 23:53.315
And here... is our man.

23:53.351 --> 23:54.383
If he's in our system, we should

23:54.418 --> 23:56.106
get a hit off facial recognition.

23:58.940 --> 24:01.323
Grace has always been
too trusting of people.

24:01.832 --> 24:02.864
Come on, come on.

24:03.361 --> 24:04.326
(beeps)

24:04.362 --> 24:05.803
(groans)

24:07.711 --> 24:10.165
Whoever he is, he's never
been arrested for anything.

24:10.201 --> 24:12.368
I-I wish that made me feel better.

24:12.403 --> 24:14.203
But if he was harmless,

24:14.238 --> 24:16.171
I would've heard from her by now.

24:18.711 --> 24:20.142
I know that face.

24:26.817 --> 24:28.217
GRACE: You almost finished?

24:28.252 --> 24:29.218
Yeah.

24:29.253 --> 24:30.432
Getting there.

24:32.223 --> 24:33.672
Does it bother you?

24:34.292 --> 24:36.158
All the things the bullies say?

24:36.992 --> 24:38.160
Not anymore.

24:38.229 --> 24:41.030
Um... look, I should

24:41.065 --> 24:42.480
- probably get going...
- It bothers me.

24:42.515 --> 24:45.034
I wasn't very sporty out in the pitch.

24:45.069 --> 24:46.502
So the kids, they'd have a go at me.

24:46.537 --> 24:48.170
But I fought back.

24:48.784 --> 24:50.472
I even broke a boy's arm once.

24:50.870 --> 24:54.043
(chuckles) Tripped him
when he wasn't looking.

24:54.711 --> 24:56.478
But he knew it was me.

24:56.514 --> 24:58.559
He never mocked me again.

25:03.454 --> 25:04.420
All right.

25:04.455 --> 25:07.022
I think I have it.

25:13.719 --> 25:15.364
Wait! Grace!

25:15.399 --> 25:16.999
I can explain, uh...

25:17.034 --> 25:19.335
Please just listen to me... please!

25:19.370 --> 25:20.369
Unlock the door!

25:20.404 --> 25:22.004
Just wait! Just wait!

25:22.039 --> 25:23.910
I want to leave now. Open the door.

25:23.945 --> 25:26.375
Listen to me... you need to
hear my side of all of this.

25:26.410 --> 25:28.377
Listen... Stop! Stop!

25:28.412 --> 25:30.346
(grunting): Grace, stop.

25:30.381 --> 25:31.447
- Grace, please.
- Let go!

25:31.482 --> 25:33.248
Stop that. (grunts)

25:33.284 --> 25:34.450
Stay. Just please, listen to me.

25:34.485 --> 25:37.286
No, don't leave.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.228
Look what you've done now.

25:49.610 --> 25:51.610
Marguerite will be with you today.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.502
- ***
- Very well.

25:55.985 --> 25:58.005
Do you have any idea where Kaley is?

25:59.855 --> 26:02.139
She should be with Gentleman 33.

26:03.859 --> 26:04.958
How long's it been?

26:04.994 --> 26:06.283
Almost ten minutes.

26:06.549 --> 26:07.581
Does Finch know?

26:10.800 --> 26:11.899
Okay.

26:11.934 --> 26:14.868
Tell the gentleman I'll
be with him right away.

26:25.848 --> 26:27.781
Kaley, what are you doing?

26:30.279 --> 26:33.153
Ambassador Gregson,
the focus of my foundation

26:33.189 --> 26:35.106
is to bring relief supplies
to the north,

26:35.141 --> 26:38.156
which as you're well aware,
is controlled by warlords.

26:38.828 --> 26:41.128
- Yes, yes.
- (knocking)

26:41.163 --> 26:42.843
Frightful stuff.

26:43.766 --> 26:46.133
Ah, eh, a military escort

26:46.168 --> 26:47.701
is exactly what we had in mind.

26:47.736 --> 26:48.989
Thank you.

26:51.059 --> 26:52.739
Where's my Irish ginger?

26:52.775 --> 26:54.775
I'm terribly sorry, Your Highness.

26:54.810 --> 26:56.076
Don't you dare call me that.

26:57.146 --> 26:58.123
Not in here.

26:59.048 --> 27:00.235
Right.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.749
Apologies. Our girl is out ill today,

27:02.785 --> 27:05.119
but I'm having another one
sent in straight away.

27:05.154 --> 27:06.163
Out sick?

27:07.022 --> 27:08.689
I just saw her last night.

27:08.724 --> 27:10.657
Apparently, it hit her quite suddenly.

27:10.693 --> 27:13.060
But I'm sure you'll be pleased
with another one of our girls.

27:13.095 --> 27:14.962
I don't take kindly to people
who muck me about.

27:14.997 --> 27:16.663
Did Molly muck you about?

27:23.072 --> 27:26.106
What exactly are you insinuating?

27:26.860 --> 27:28.143
Nothing.

27:28.940 --> 27:31.045
Nothing at all. I'm sorry.

27:31.080 --> 27:32.980
I...

27:33.015 --> 27:35.380
I suppose I'm still upset.

27:37.393 --> 27:38.559
About Molly.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.966
Sometimes I think
she was the only person

27:53.275 --> 27:54.935
who truly understood me.

27:58.007 --> 27:58.972
(quiet laugh)

28:02.188 --> 28:03.597
(door opens)

28:04.880 --> 28:06.893
Mrs. Harris, when you showed me
this picture

28:06.929 --> 28:08.861
of your little boy...

28:09.818 --> 28:11.885
why didn't you tell me that
he was a fully grown man?

28:11.921 --> 28:13.887
Neville will always be my little boy.

28:13.923 --> 28:15.252
Now, what's this all about?

28:15.277 --> 28:16.686
Um, my sister's missing.

28:16.711 --> 28:18.926
And Neville was the last
person she was seen with.

28:18.961 --> 28:20.973
BRUNO: Her sister was Molly
Ryan's flatmate.

28:20.998 --> 28:22.327
The same girl who was photographed

28:22.352 --> 28:23.343
from this very apartment.

28:23.378 --> 28:25.422
The same girl who was
murdered across the street.

28:27.803 --> 28:29.277
You're not suggesting...

28:31.874 --> 28:33.290
Neville is a gentle boy.

28:33.326 --> 28:34.619
He would never hurt anybody.

28:34.654 --> 28:35.651
Did he ever take an interest in

28:35.687 --> 28:37.432
any of the women from the neighborhood?

28:37.467 --> 28:39.394
You mean, like, bothering them? No.

28:39.715 --> 28:41.393
No. My son keeps to himself.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.342
He spends his time
on his sewing machine.

28:43.367 --> 28:44.751
Not hassling women.

28:44.787 --> 28:46.552
"Sewing machine," but he...

28:46.889 --> 28:48.417
There's no sewing machine here.

28:49.951 --> 28:51.086
Well, no...

28:51.121 --> 28:52.260
Does he have a workplace?

28:53.195 --> 28:54.127
Take classes somewhere?

28:54.163 --> 28:55.277
Have a studio?

28:55.831 --> 28:58.065
Look, I told you
my son didn't do anything wrong.

28:58.380 --> 28:59.218
He couldn't.

28:59.254 --> 29:00.423
BRUNO: Mrs. Harris,
I understand that you're

29:00.458 --> 29:02.313
just trying to protect your boy, I do.

29:02.338 --> 29:04.443
And you know what... I even believe you

29:04.468 --> 29:07.507
when you tell me that you don't
think he's done anything wrong.

29:07.532 --> 29:10.182
But the thing is sometimes
the people that we love,

29:10.557 --> 29:11.566
well, we don't know them

29:11.601 --> 29:12.539
as well as we think we do.

29:12.574 --> 29:14.114
Sometimes they surprise us.

29:14.149 --> 29:17.084
Sometimes, you know,
they just make a mistake.

29:17.119 --> 29:20.053
Now, we... we want to protect Neville.

29:20.089 --> 29:23.657
We want to help him make sure
that he doesn't make a mistake

29:23.692 --> 29:25.095
that will change the rest of his life.

29:25.462 --> 29:28.150
Now the only way that we can
help him is if you help us.

29:32.067 --> 29:33.133
Hey, there.

29:33.168 --> 29:35.068
You all right?

29:35.104 --> 29:36.696
It's okay.

29:38.073 --> 29:39.331
You bumped your head when you slipped...

29:39.367 --> 29:40.107
You pushed me.

29:45.695 --> 29:46.913
Molly had a stalker,

29:46.949 --> 29:48.115
and it was you... wasn't it?

29:51.086 --> 29:52.085
You stole that dress.

29:52.121 --> 29:54.563
You stole her... stuffed animal.

29:54.599 --> 29:58.418
No, I wanted something
to remember her by.

30:01.930 --> 30:04.241
I didn't kill her if that's
what you're thinking.

30:04.867 --> 30:07.034
I swear, I never even touched Molly.

30:07.699 --> 30:10.037
But I'm not gonna lie.

30:10.072 --> 30:11.938
I wanted to. I quite fancied her...

30:11.974 --> 30:13.006
You didn't even know her.

30:13.042 --> 30:14.041
Yes!

30:14.076 --> 30:15.635
I did.

30:16.332 --> 30:17.878
In a way.

30:17.913 --> 30:19.913
I watched her from my window.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.948
I would've never harmed her!

30:21.984 --> 30:26.239
I wish I could've protected her
like I protected you today...

30:26.264 --> 30:27.025
I get it.

30:28.708 --> 30:29.990
Look...

30:30.605 --> 30:32.446
I get it, Neville.

30:35.295 --> 30:36.361
You're a good guy. You really are.

30:36.396 --> 30:38.540
Molly would've liked you.

30:38.889 --> 30:40.265
You think?

30:40.992 --> 30:43.643
Molly had a thing for sweet guys

30:43.678 --> 30:45.670
with a heart of gold.

30:49.810 --> 30:51.209
I knew it.

30:51.244 --> 30:52.277
I-I should've spoken to her.

30:52.312 --> 30:55.280
I-I just get so bloody nervous.

30:55.315 --> 30:56.681
(screams)

31:05.625 --> 31:08.193
(grunting)

31:08.228 --> 31:10.161
Wait! Wait! Stop!

31:10.197 --> 31:12.163
(Neville grunting)

31:18.205 --> 31:19.204
(tires screeching)

31:21.241 --> 31:23.208
Stop it, Grace.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.757
You crazy, girl.

31:28.120 --> 31:29.496
You shouldn't have hurt me.

31:29.521 --> 31:32.155
- Let me go!
- Y-You'll tell on me.

31:32.191 --> 31:34.581
You're not nice, like Molly,
you're a monster,

31:34.616 --> 31:36.932
just like everybody says here.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.229
(tires screeching, siren wailing)

31:39.264 --> 31:42.065
GRACE: Help me!

31:42.100 --> 31:44.968
Grace! Drop that blade,
Neville, drop it right now.

31:46.104 --> 31:47.237
Natalie!

31:47.272 --> 31:49.039
You-you don't understand.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.974
She attacked me, I swear, you have...

31:51.009 --> 31:52.108
Just listen to me for a second.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.269
Sh-She did this to me.

31:55.934 --> 31:56.980
GRACE: Natalie!

31:57.015 --> 31:57.981
I had to escape.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.082
Be quiet!

31:59.117 --> 32:00.116
Uh, please,

32:00.152 --> 32:02.118
back up, both of you.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.571
We're not gonna hurt you.
We just need you to let her go.

32:04.606 --> 32:05.515
No.

32:06.600 --> 32:07.553
Natalie...

32:10.062 --> 32:11.356
That's my sister, Neville.

32:11.849 --> 32:13.421
I love her very much, okay?

32:13.457 --> 32:15.240
I wouldn't want anything
to happen to her.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.968
Neville, we spoke with your mother.

32:18.003 --> 32:19.400
My mum?

32:19.972 --> 32:21.037
Why?

32:21.073 --> 32:23.873
Because we know how much
she cares about you.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.875
As much as I care about my sister.

32:27.726 --> 32:29.692
How would your mom feel if you hurt her?

32:34.052 --> 32:36.920
You know how upset
that would make her, don't you?

32:38.023 --> 32:40.345
She would be so disappointed in you.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.504
Please, Neville.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.836
(grunts)

32:52.871 --> 32:53.903
BRUNO: That's enough!

32:53.939 --> 32:55.905
You're under arrest, all right?

32:58.877 --> 32:59.909
It's okay, Grace.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.178
It's okay.

33:07.819 --> 33:08.818
(clears throat)

33:16.862 --> 33:18.828
- (clears throat)
- Roz.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.830
(clears throat) You scared me.

33:20.866 --> 33:24.200
- Hi.
- Why the bloody hell

33:24.236 --> 33:27.137
did you sneak Patrick Ryan
into the club?

33:27.172 --> 33:28.238
I didn't. Okay?

33:28.273 --> 33:29.627
He was just standing there,

33:29.652 --> 33:31.174
and he was in the corridor,
about  get caught,

33:31.209 --> 33:33.743
- and I...
- So you shagged him.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.213
It was just pretend.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.701
(sighs)

33:40.737 --> 33:41.847
Why?

33:43.155 --> 33:45.221
- Are you jealous?
- This isn't a bloody joke!

33:45.257 --> 33:47.023
Molly's brother broke into
Finch's office.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.503
He stole the client ledger.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.436
God...

33:53.472 --> 33:55.198
Finch is on a warpath, Kaley.

33:55.233 --> 33:58.168
If he finds out you had
anything to do with it,

33:58.203 --> 33:59.871
he's going to hunt us down

33:59.896 --> 34:01.466
and kill us both.

34:05.110 --> 34:06.142
(hinges creaking)

34:29.228 --> 34:32.081
_

34:46.818 --> 34:48.784
♪ ♪

34:54.926 --> 34:55.958
(sighs)

34:55.994 --> 34:57.927
Come on, Pepper, get on with it.

35:03.001 --> 35:04.734
Finch. What...

35:04.770 --> 35:05.727
What brings you out here?

35:05.762 --> 35:07.640
You and your cousin...

35:07.675 --> 35:09.180
you're pretty close, are you?

35:10.947 --> 35:13.037
Relatively.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.912
Are you being straight with me,
Mr. Purferoy?

35:18.818 --> 35:19.915
Look, Finch...

35:19.951 --> 35:21.275
I'd appreciate some honesty.

35:21.311 --> 35:22.886
The bloke was threatening
to tell my wife

35:22.921 --> 35:24.589
if I didn't get him in.
What was I supposed to do?

35:24.624 --> 35:26.347
I thought he just nted
to knob a fancy girl.

35:26.383 --> 35:28.212
He wasn't there to knob
a fancy girl, you prat.

35:28.237 --> 35:29.826
He was there to nick something of mine.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.265
Something very vuable.

35:33.498 --> 35:34.931
Oh, God.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.520
FINCH: What's the man's real name?

35:36.902 --> 35:38.161
I don't know.

35:38.449 --> 35:39.882
He didn't tell me.

35:40.238 --> 35:41.204
Are you lying to me?

35:42.874 --> 35:44.256
Because you lied to me before.

Hopefully, first thing tomorrow,

Why? None of this is your fault.

38:11.136 --> 38:12.191
I wouldn't have let him come near you.
