00:02.602 --> 00:04.105
**

00:04.205 --> 00:05.439
Evan,
that's too much soy milk.

00:08.942 --> 00:09.877
(knife clatters)

00:09.977 --> 00:11.412
We both know
where this leads.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.248
You add too much milk,
then you'll add more cereal.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.050
Then you'll need more milk,
and where does it end?

00:16.149 --> 00:18.686
But dry Alpha-Bits
taste gross.

00:18.786 --> 00:19.687
When I was your age,

00:19.787 --> 00:21.389
I had to soften my cereal
with rainwater.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.790
Emery,
you only need one comb!

00:24.958 --> 00:26.594
But they all have
a specific use.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.062
Pick one!

00:28.162 --> 00:29.063
Pick?

00:30.431 --> 00:32.100
Oh, no.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.303
Eddie,
stop reading that trash.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.037
How does
she always know?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.373
If I have to come in there,
it's gonna be worse for you.

00:39.473 --> 00:42.876
But I'm reading
about King Crawdad's
amazing backstory!

00:42.976 --> 00:45.413
He's also a deacon.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.152
* Fresh off the boat

00:51.252 --> 00:52.886
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

00:52.986 --> 00:55.156
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

00:55.256 --> 00:56.457
* Fresh off the boat

00:56.557 --> 00:58.759
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

00:58.859 --> 01:00.261
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:00.361 --> 01:03.063
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:03.164 --> 01:05.065
The apples in here are for you,
not your teachers.

01:05.166 --> 01:07.401
Their lives are easy enough
without also getting free food.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.670
Mom, did you remember to --
Yes, I made your sandwich
with double mustard.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.139
And you'll return
"Return of the King"?

01:11.239 --> 01:13.507
Emery, is your stutter back?
Good.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.976
Your struggle will come
in handy when we write
your college essay.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.145
"Return of the King"
is the last book

01:17.245 --> 01:18.846
in "The Lord of the Rings"
trilogy.

01:18.946 --> 01:20.914
I got it at the library,
and it's due back today.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.683
Oh, those books
about the hairy-footed children

01:22.783 --> 01:24.185
who can't keep track
of their jewelry?

01:24.285 --> 01:25.986
Yes, I will return it.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.821
Evan, you can't wear
those sandals to school!

01:27.921 --> 01:29.423
You might stub your toe
on a rock.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.791
Highly unlikely, Mommy.
(door opens, closes)

01:30.891 --> 01:33.026
These sandals are made
for climbing rocks.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.128
They're rock-friendly.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.029
You know who else
thought he was safe in sandals?

01:36.130 --> 01:37.498
Your buddy Jesus.
Change 'em up.

01:37.598 --> 01:41.335
**

01:41.435 --> 01:43.137
The one with the cowboys.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.839
They both ha--
The handso cowboys.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.541
Mm. Sorry, guys.
(chuckles)

01:47.641 --> 01:48.776
Big day at work --

01:48.876 --> 01:50.978
getting a delivery
of three dozen racks of ribs.

01:51.078 --> 01:53.046
That's 468
individual ribs.

01:53.147 --> 01:55.048
Well, I already fed the boys
breakfast.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.184
I got them off to school.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.785
Now I just have
to clean up the house,

01:57.885 --> 01:59.320
do laundry,
pick up the dry-cleaning,

01:59.420 --> 02:01.322
hit the library, and then
try on my wedding dress.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.158
I try it on once a year to make
sure I'm still the same size.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.160
My tux still fits,
but my shoes don't.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.127
I can't explain it.
Then
Honey's picking me up.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.298
We're gonna go stage a house
we just put on the market.

02:10.398 --> 02:13.133
I listed the price way too high
to generate a buzz.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.335
You're a machine,
Jessica.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.804
I am --
a machine with a heart,

02:16.904 --> 02:18.839
a heart that pumps
efficiency.

02:18.939 --> 02:19.873
(sneezes)

02:21.809 --> 02:23.177
No "bless you"?

02:25.346 --> 02:26.580
I'll remember that.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.552
**

02:31.652 --> 02:34.222
You guys won't believe the
magazine I snuck into school.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.256
Get out.
No way.
Stop.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.557
Is this
really happening?

02:36.657 --> 02:37.691
Oh, it's happening.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.530
(chuckles)
Yes!

02:42.630 --> 02:44.064
What kind of sick joke
is this?

02:44.164 --> 02:45.065
Fish Head Jackson.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.201
I can't believe he's defending
his belt tomorrow night

02:47.301 --> 02:49.069
here in Orlando,
and we're not gonna be there.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.738
Against King Crawdad --

02:50.838 --> 02:52.840
"The Battle
of the Swamp Creatures."

02:52.940 --> 02:56.510
It's on pay-per-view, but
they're charging $59.99 for it.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.511
(all whistle)

02:57.611 --> 02:58.912
Those are
Toni Braxton prices.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.682
Big Wrestling stopped caring
about the common man years ago.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.117
I'd love to go, but there's
no way my mom says yes --

03:04.218 --> 03:05.719
way too much
fake violence.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.388
Yeah,
my mom's against it, too.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.722
She won't admit it,

03:08.822 --> 03:11.392
but I'm pretty sure
Fish Head Jackson's my dad.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.695
Yeah, I can swing a steel chair
super hard.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.096
Where do you think
I get that from?

03:19.233 --> 03:20.801
**

03:20.901 --> 03:22.536
What are you
talking about?!

03:22.636 --> 03:25.406
Fish Head Jackson absolutely
takes down King Crawdad.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.375
The guy owns
the squared circle.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.542
(quietly) Yes.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.711
You got to be drunk
to think that.

03:30.811 --> 03:34.081
King Crawdad has the best
turnbuckle game in the business.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.250
Here come the insults.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.386
Okay, there's a lot of things
I have to be drunk for,

03:38.486 --> 03:39.620
but this is not
one of them.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.988
Then you're a fool.

03:41.088 --> 03:44.224
Oh, I love it when white people
be getting personal.

03:44.325 --> 03:46.494
(chuckles)
Hey, boss, you gonna watch
the pay-per-view?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.161
Oh, no.

03:48.262 --> 03:51.332
No way Jessica would allow that.
It has "pay" in the title.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.101
But I love how everyone's
talking about the match.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.437
I'm even gonna do
a lunch special on spareribs.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.605
Ready?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.973
I'm calling it...
"Breaking Ribs."

04:00.073 --> 04:01.275
(chuckles)

04:01.375 --> 04:02.610
Huh?
(telephone rings)

04:02.710 --> 04:03.944
Oh.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.145
Cattleman's Ranch.
This is Louis.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.514
JESSICA: No discounts
 on the spareribs.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.416
[ receiver clicks, dial tone ]

04:08.516 --> 04:11.151
(coughs, sniffles)

04:12.686 --> 04:14.322
I am not.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.023
(coughing)

04:19.459 --> 04:22.430
I don't get sick.
There's too much to do.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.997
That's why
I use this every day.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.002
This is white flower oil.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.872
It cures everything --
allergies, muscle aches,

04:31.972 --> 04:33.140
"depression."

04:33.240 --> 04:34.542
(coughs)

04:34.642 --> 04:36.710
Resiliency --

04:36.810 --> 04:38.479
that's my fragrance.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.047
**

04:40.147 --> 04:41.782
(doorbell rings)

04:43.451 --> 04:45.353
Jessica?

04:45.453 --> 04:46.186
Hey, Honey.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.455
You ready to go stage
that house?

04:47.555 --> 04:50.724
Let's take your car
so I don't have to burn my gas.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.893
Are you feeling okay?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.628
Of course.
Never better!

04:55.863 --> 04:56.897
Jessica.

04:56.997 --> 04:57.731
Yeah?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.567
Did you hear
what I just said?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.869
When?
Just now.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.871
I've been talking
for the past five minutes.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.205
When?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.409
Just now
for the past five minutes?

05:08.509 --> 05:10.811
How do I put this
delicately?

05:11.812 --> 05:13.347
You look toe' up.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.650
(sighs)

05:16.750 --> 05:19.920
(nasally) Hey, Honey!
When did you get here?

05:20.020 --> 05:22.055
Apparently,
not soon enough.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.491
When?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.231
(coughs)
I wish
you would've called me at work.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.667
I did call you at work.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.503
You heard what I said
about the spareribs, right?

05:35.603 --> 05:37.037
Y-Yes, don't worry
about the spareribs.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.372
They remain
at full price.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.173
I'm talking about
you being sick.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.509
Luckily, Honey called me.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.110
No, I'm telling you,
I'm fine.
No.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.612
I still have so much
I need to do.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.915
The only thing you need to do
is rest.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.385
I can get you an extra blanket
or a glass of water.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.920
(snoring)

05:53.020 --> 05:55.288
Mm. She sleeps.

05:56.890 --> 05:58.125
(screams)
Aah!

06:00.794 --> 06:02.563
Good God!

06:04.632 --> 06:07.134
Okay, listen up --
Mom has the flu.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.802
What do you mean?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.270
She's sick.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.705
But Mom
never gets sick.

06:11.805 --> 06:12.906
Well, sometimes,
even the most

06:13.006 --> 06:14.542
well-engineered machines
break down.

06:14.642 --> 06:15.709
Wait.
So what's happening?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.244
Your mother is sick.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.547
I feel like
you're not being clear.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.781
Your mother is sick!

06:20.881 --> 06:21.949
(sighs deeply)

06:22.049 --> 06:24.384
Now, we're all going
to have to dig deep

06:24.485 --> 06:25.886
and band together
to pick up the slack

06:25.986 --> 06:27.087
while your mother recovers.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.990
Totally, Dad. Sounds great.
We're on board.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.259
Evan, could you go get us
a couple of sodas?

06:32.359 --> 06:33.494
Sure.

06:36.096 --> 06:39.667
Now, if I could just suggest
one idea...

06:39.767 --> 06:41.101
Okay.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.303
(sighs)

06:44.805 --> 06:47.841
Now, I love Mom.
We all do.

06:47.941 --> 06:49.843
Love her, want nothing
but the best for her,

06:49.943 --> 06:53.080
want her to get better,
which she absolutely will,

06:53.180 --> 06:56.450
but until then, instead of
seeing this as a bad thing --

06:56.550 --> 06:58.819
which, let me make it clear,
it totally is --

06:58.919 --> 07:01.922
we can also choose to see it
as an opportunity.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.324
Go on.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.425
Now, the fact is,

07:05.526 --> 07:08.462
99% of the time,
Mom is watching us.

07:08.562 --> 07:11.431
She somehow always knows
everything that's going on.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.468
And right now,
Mom's sick for the first time

07:14.568 --> 07:17.170
since I've known her,
which means...

07:17.270 --> 07:19.139
The Eye of Sauron
is down.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.841
What?

07:20.941 --> 07:22.543
From
"The Lord of the Rings" books.

07:22.643 --> 07:25.045
The Eye of Sauron
is a mystical force

07:25.145 --> 07:26.514
that can see everything
that's happening

07:26.614 --> 07:27.781
throughout Middle Earth.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.049
Great, yes, the Eye.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.051
And while
we all love the Eye

07:31.151 --> 07:32.820
and we all want it
to open back up

07:32.920 --> 07:34.522
as soon as possible,

07:34.622 --> 07:35.889
we have a small window.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.191
And I'm not saying to go crazy
during that window.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.960
No.
That's not what I'm saying.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.194
Emery, am I saying that?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.796
No?

07:42.896 --> 07:43.897
That's right.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.733
All I'm saying is, for this

07:45.833 --> 07:48.301
once-in-certainly-my-lifetime
opportunity,

07:48.401 --> 07:50.337
we maybe do...

07:50.437 --> 07:52.405
one thing we normally
couldn't do?

07:55.175 --> 07:56.977
Like order
"Battle of the Swamp Creatures"

07:57.077 --> 07:58.478
on pay-per-view.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.880
* Yeah *

08:01.414 --> 08:02.415
Ice, please.

08:02.516 --> 08:03.751
(sighs)

08:03.851 --> 08:05.385
I almost went with ice.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.087
I'm kicking myself.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.221
I'm in.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.090
Me too.
Wonderful.

08:10.190 --> 08:13.060
Now we just need to convince
our backup Mom --

08:13.160 --> 08:14.528
Evan.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.597
$59.99 on pay-per-view?

08:16.697 --> 08:18.198
No way Mom would let us
buy that.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.701
Yeah, you're right, Evan.
You're so right.

08:20.801 --> 08:21.869
It's a shame, though,

08:21.969 --> 08:23.370
missing all those adults
dressed like animals.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.372
Animals?
Oh, yeah!

08:25.472 --> 08:27.708
The main event is between a guy
dressed like a fish

08:27.808 --> 08:28.942
and a guy dressed
like a crawdad.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.243
Really?

08:31.879 --> 08:33.681
I think a crawdad
would beat up a fish.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.381
They have claws,
like tiny lobsters.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.951
Too bad
we'll never know for sure.

08:38.051 --> 08:41.121
Well, we could do
a scientific experiment,

08:41.221 --> 08:44.224
but it's really expensive
to rent a lab.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.793
Not to mention
the tank fees.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.261
And good luck finding
free parking in this city.
Hmm.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.531
We can't afford
to not watch this fight.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.700
For science.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.134
For science!
For science!
For science!

08:54.234 --> 08:55.569
Okay,
just so we all understand,

08:55.669 --> 08:57.571
this is the one thing we do
while the Eye is down.

08:57.671 --> 08:58.806
Agreed?

08:58.906 --> 09:01.041
I bought us a bigger TV.

09:01.141 --> 09:03.644
Went from 27 to 30 inches.
Your mom will never notice.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.412
She doesn't concern herself
with electronics.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.814
What happened
to "one thing"?

09:06.914 --> 09:09.249
Well, if we're paying for
"Battle of the Swamp Creatures,"

09:09.349 --> 09:11.118
we have to watch it
on a proper TV.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.452
I agree, and honestly,

09:12.552 --> 09:14.254
our cost-per-pixel
just went down.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.956
We can't stop saving money.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.424
Okay, I'm gonna clean
this place.

09:17.524 --> 09:18.892
We can't have
any dust interfering

09:18.992 --> 09:20.227
with our new
picture quality.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.629
You guys
get your homework done,

09:21.729 --> 09:23.396
and then we're gonna go
stock up on fight snacks.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.497
To the books!

09:28.501 --> 09:30.738
I've never him run
to do his homework before.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.973
I've never seen him
run before.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.608
Mm.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.276
**

09:36.376 --> 09:37.177
Homework's done?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.146
Worked my Ticonderoga
to the nub.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.449
Wow. Okay.

09:42.549 --> 09:44.151
So, your mom's been
out of commission for a day.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.318
Before we hit the store,

09:45.418 --> 09:46.820
we need to make sure
she's still sick

09:46.920 --> 09:49.022
so the Eye of Sauron stays shut
for the fight.

09:49.122 --> 09:49.990
I mean, we love her.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.025
-Love the Eye.
-It's the prettiest.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.160
Can't wait
for it to reopen.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.795
But we need her asleep
by the undercard --

09:54.895 --> 09:56.764
Python Ramirez
vs. Morris Silverman.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.333
Morris hasn't earned
his swamp name yet.

10:00.433 --> 10:04.104
**

10:04.204 --> 10:05.773
JESSICA:
(weakly) Come in.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.944
So,
how are you feeling?

10:11.044 --> 10:12.112
(shivering)

10:12.212 --> 10:13.881
Oh, you're shivering.
You have the chills.

10:13.981 --> 10:15.015
Oh, I'm fine.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.650
I was just gonna get
dinner started.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.886
Whoa, there, Mommy.
You're walking like a baby deer.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.054
Yeah, you definitely need
more rest.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.691
Look, the boys and I brought in
everything you need

10:23.791 --> 10:25.826
so you can stay in bed
all day and night.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.961
Here, Mom. Drink this.
You need sleep.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.730
Be liberal
with that dose.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.898
Thank you.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.499
I'm sorry.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.702
I feel terrible.
I'm so out of it.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.237
Oh, please. It happens.
You're human.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.906
Now let's get you comfy.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.641
(coughing)

10:41.742 --> 10:43.643
No. You should go.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.645
I don't want you
to catch any of my germs.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.513
Good call.

10:47.547 --> 10:49.817
I don't see myself
washing my hands anytime soon.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.686
We're off to run some errands.
We'll be gone for awhile.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.321
You know,
tough out there without you,

10:54.421 --> 10:55.555
but we'll manage.
(chuckles)

10:55.655 --> 10:57.257
I'll even sleep
in Eddie's room tonight.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.559
I-In the meantime,
I'll turn on this humidifier

10:59.659 --> 11:01.028
so you can keep sleeping.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.731
(loud whirring)

11:03.831 --> 11:07.067
Okay, sleep long --
uh, I mean tight.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.770
Y-You know, tight and long.
(chuckles nervously)

11:15.575 --> 11:17.544
The Eye of Sauron
is down.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.912
But let's double-check
the ear.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.548
Jessica?

11:21.648 --> 11:24.551
Mom, is that orange juice
pulpy enough for you?

11:26.453 --> 11:28.555
Sometimes,
I prefer hugs from Dad.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.391
Aww! Is that true?

11:32.726 --> 11:33.560
Sure.

11:35.362 --> 11:40.133
**

11:40.233 --> 11:41.234
LOUIS:
We're not getting that.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.270
We're getting this.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.404
(chuckles)

11:45.939 --> 11:48.575
It's Shirley Temple time!

11:48.675 --> 11:49.709
Diet ginger ale?

11:49.810 --> 11:52.746
Mom may be out of commission,
but diabetes isn't.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.114
EDDIE: Dad!

11:54.214 --> 11:55.983
LOUIS: No!

11:59.386 --> 12:00.954
(register beeping)

12:03.090 --> 12:04.892
Okay, Carmen Electra
is the last thing.

12:04.992 --> 12:07.795
After this, we go home,
quietly unpack our snacks,

12:07.895 --> 12:08.996
and get ready
for fight night.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.730
(register buzzing)

12:10.831 --> 12:12.599
Gentle.
She's a lady.

12:12.699 --> 12:16.169
So...put her in a different bag
than the beef jerky?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.840
Here you go.
Oh.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.078
Mm-hmm.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.147
(whispering) Hey!

12:27.247 --> 12:29.682
Niagara Falls,
stifle those nuts.

12:29.783 --> 12:31.018
You're gonna wake the Eye.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.252
(whispers) Sorry.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.357
(knock on door)

12:39.159 --> 12:40.660
Let's get ready

12:40.760 --> 12:43.296
to repti-i-i-i-i-i-le!

12:43.396 --> 12:44.464
Shh!

12:45.632 --> 12:47.267
Shh!
Marvin, keep it down.

12:47.367 --> 12:48.768
Jessica is asleep.

12:48.869 --> 12:49.769
What are you doing here?

12:49.870 --> 12:51.371
It's fight night.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.439
Honey's actually there.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.540
She had two tickets,

12:53.640 --> 12:55.208
but they won't allow me
in the convention center

12:55.308 --> 12:57.044
since they put in
metal detectors.

12:57.144 --> 12:59.112
Always packin'.
(chuckles)

12:59.212 --> 13:01.648
Luckily, uh, little Evan
there invited me to
your viewing party.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.952
I bet him $50 that King Crawdad
beats Fish Head Jackson.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.686
Yeah,
everything's more fun to watch

13:06.786 --> 13:08.355
when an allowance
is on the line.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.323
Evan, you shouldn't have
invited anyone.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.724
We're trying
to keep this quiet.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.393
Mom is in the next room.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.628
Let's get ready
to repti-i-i-i-i-le!

13:15.728 --> 13:17.130
Shh!
(laughing) Hey!

13:17.230 --> 13:18.866
You're sitting next to me,
Red.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.035
What?
At least they brought something.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.070
Wh--

13:23.170 --> 13:24.504
That's pumpkin filling.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.705
We're on our way to a pie.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.040
W--

13:27.140 --> 13:31.011
**

13:31.111 --> 13:33.046
Well, hello, there.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.850
ANNOUNCER: Boy, Tom,
 Fish Head Jackson and Crawdad

13:36.950 --> 13:38.185
are really going at it.

13:38.285 --> 13:42.422
(stifled cheering)

13:42.522 --> 13:44.824
He is rocked!

13:44.925 --> 13:46.593
Come on, Crawdad, you bum!

13:46.693 --> 13:48.195
Use your claws!

13:54.868 --> 13:56.169
Oh.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.171
(whispering) Hey, Marvin. Look,
there's Honey.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.606
[ indistinct shouting ]

13:59.706 --> 14:01.208
(laughing)
Oh, hi.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.910
(normal voice)
The hell?

14:03.010 --> 14:06.046
**

14:10.117 --> 14:11.584
(loud whirring)

14:14.888 --> 14:16.723
She left
the humidifier on.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.758
She wanted
to trick us so bad,

14:18.858 --> 14:21.228
she was willing
to waste electricity.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.763
We're gonna head out.
Thanks for everything.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.632
Great party.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.110
**

14:47.220 --> 14:48.255
(screams)

14:51.458 --> 14:52.492
What are you doing here?

14:52.592 --> 14:54.394
What are you doing
out of here?

14:54.494 --> 14:55.828
I can't believe
you were the first person

14:55.929 --> 14:56.896
to sneak
out of the house.

14:56.997 --> 14:59.466
I would've bet my life savings
on Eddie.

14:59.566 --> 15:00.900
I --
EVAN: Don't bother, Mommy.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.070
We know you were at the
"Battle of the Swamp Creatures."

15:03.170 --> 15:04.804
What's going on?
Were you even sick?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.839
Of course I was.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.076
I was really sick.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.110
(sighs)

15:10.210 --> 15:11.611
But after
a good night's sleep,

15:11.711 --> 15:13.746
I woke up
feeling much better.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.248
(groans)

15:19.086 --> 15:20.487
Then the phone rang.
(sighs)

15:20.587 --> 15:21.955
(telephone rings)

15:22.055 --> 15:22.922
(telephone beeps)

15:23.023 --> 15:24.091
Hello?

15:24.191 --> 15:26.626
Hey, sweetie. It's me.
Just checking in on you.

15:26.726 --> 15:27.627
Are you feeling better?

15:27.727 --> 15:29.529
Actually, I am.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.931
Yeah, I slept really well
last --
Perfect.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.801
Because I got two tickets to
"Battle of the Swamp Creatures,"

15:34.901 --> 15:35.868
and I want you to come.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.437
You'll love it.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.041
It's like a sweatier,
more violent "Melrose Place."

15:41.141 --> 15:45.145
Those are my only two criticisms
of "Melrose Place."

15:45.245 --> 15:47.947
Ugh!
But there's no way I can go.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.149
Come on.
Sure you can.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.051
Honey,
I am a mother of three

15:51.151 --> 15:52.385
who's just been bedridden
for 24 hours.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.622
Unlike you, I can't sit around,
drinking martinis all day.

15:55.722 --> 15:57.790
I'm sure the house is a mess,
no one's eaten,

15:57.890 --> 16:00.127
and none of the boys
have done their homework.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.394
Maybe Evan started his,

16:01.494 --> 16:03.396
but there's now way
he could've done theirs.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.898
Well...

16:05.999 --> 16:07.400
I have an extra pair
of foam claws

16:07.500 --> 16:08.635
if you change your mind.
(chuckles)

16:08.735 --> 16:10.303
JESSICA:
 It was a tempting offer.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.072
But after being
 out of commission for a day,

16:12.172 --> 16:13.673
there's no way I could go.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.676
I knew the house
 would be chaos.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.481
But when I came out,
 the place was spotless.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.416
You boys were doing
 your homework.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.517
I couldn't believe it.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.654
Why are you
pressing so hard?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.256
Because I write
like I play basketball --

16:29.356 --> 16:31.158
hard and a little
out of control.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.861
I knew if I said
 I was feeling better,

16:34.961 --> 16:38.098
things would go back to normal,
 and I didn't want them to.

16:38.198 --> 16:41.168
I wanted more time
 before I had to be responsible

16:41.268 --> 16:43.570
for everything
 and everyone again.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.906
So I snuck back in my room,
read magazines,

16:47.006 --> 16:48.108
tried on my wedding dress --

16:48.208 --> 16:49.776
still fits, by the way,
knew it would.

16:49.876 --> 16:54.347
And then I decided
to take up Honey on her offer.

16:54.447 --> 16:57.217
But I needed
one more free night.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.386
**

16:59.486 --> 17:01.588
(knock on door)

17:06.559 --> 17:07.794
(weakly) Come in.

17:07.926 --> 17:09.096
(door opens)

17:09.195 --> 17:10.597
So,
how are you feeling?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.366
(shivering)
Oh, you're shivering.
You have the chills.

17:13.465 --> 17:14.867
It was an ice cream headache.

17:14.967 --> 17:15.602
No, no, I'm fine.

17:16.435 --> 17:17.137
I was just gonna get
dinner started.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.473
Whoa, there, Mommy.
You're walking like a baby deer.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.041
I was pleased to hear
 that because that's
 what I was going for.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.411
Now let's get you comfy.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.815
(coughing)

17:28.915 --> 17:29.882
You should go.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.451
I don't want you
to get my germs.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.886
I-In the meantime,
I'll turn on this humidifier

17:33.986 --> 17:35.422
so you can keep sleeping.

17:35.522 --> 17:36.989
(loud whirring)

17:37.090 --> 17:38.291
Thank you, Jessica.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.727
You are better than me
in every way.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.329
LOUIS: I'm pretty sure
 I didn't say that.

17:42.429 --> 17:43.463
JESSICA: Yes, you did.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.432
The way I remember it,
 you did.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.933
(door closes)

17:54.841 --> 17:59.312
Then when you guys left
the house...

17:59.412 --> 18:00.980
I snuck out,
and I went to the fight.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.649
(sighs)
I can't believe this.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.151
We thought you were
safe in bed,

18:04.251 --> 18:06.919
and then we see you
waving your claw on TV.

18:07.019 --> 18:09.489
What do you mean
"you saw me on TV"?

18:09.589 --> 18:10.923
We got the fight
on pay-per-view.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.492
(gasps)

18:12.592 --> 18:14.026
They made me!
(sighs)

18:14.127 --> 18:15.962
Pay-per-view?

18:16.062 --> 18:17.830
That sounds like you have
to pay to view it.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.133
We don't pay to watch TV
in this house.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.335
We only did it because
the Eye of Sauron was down.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.971
You somehow always know
everything we're doing.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.673
And it's a bit much.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.308
I mean,
we love that you care about us.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.042
-Love it.
-Can't get enough of it.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.479
Wish you were there to stop me
from losing 50 bucks to Marvin.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.014
But it's tough feeling like
someone is always watching us.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.385
Sometimes we just need to,
you know, let loose a little.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.321
I get it.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.324
You do?

18:44.424 --> 18:48.528
It's not easy for me, either,
always having to be vigilant --

18:48.628 --> 18:50.997
packing lunches,
picking out boy clothes,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.032
running the house,
going to work.

18:53.132 --> 18:57.237
So when I saw you were
doing okay without me...

18:57.337 --> 18:59.239
I thought I could step away,

18:59.339 --> 19:01.007
just take a break for once.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.411
Jessica,
you shouldn't feel like

19:04.511 --> 19:06.679
you have to sneak away
to enjoy a night out.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.815
And you shouldn't feel like
you have to wait till I'm sick

19:08.915 --> 19:09.882
to treat yourselves.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.419
Maybe like Fish Head Jackson
and King Crawdad,

19:12.519 --> 19:13.920
we can meet in the middle.

19:14.020 --> 19:16.223
That would be nice.

19:16.323 --> 19:18.991
But we would do it for real.
Yeah.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.393
That whole event
was fake.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.929
There's no way
a crawdad would lose to a fish!

19:23.029 --> 19:24.331
That's what I thought,
too!

19:24.431 --> 19:25.932
But I guess you can't
apply logic

19:26.032 --> 19:27.400
to a sport of fools,
Mommy.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.736
My favorite.

19:29.836 --> 19:33.440
**

19:33.540 --> 19:35.275
All right, Mom,
I'll put it away!

19:35.375 --> 19:37.710
JESSICA:
I didn't say anything!

19:38.578 --> 19:39.512
Whoa.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.688
I don't need
this many combs.

19:54.427 --> 19:56.363
Crap!
I need more cereal.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.268
Crap!
I need more milk.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.238
Crap!
I need more cereal!

20:07.106 --> 20:08.207
(sighs)

20:08.308 --> 20:09.742
Mommy, help me!

20:09.842 --> 20:12.879
You can handle this, Evan.
I believe in you.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.447
What's that?

20:14.547 --> 20:17.216
Mommy's French breakfast...
for one.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.587
There you are!

20:20.687 --> 20:22.455
So, in the spirit
of meeting in the middle,

20:22.555 --> 20:23.590
I got you something.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.727
What happened to the TV?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.796
I got a new one!

20:29.896 --> 20:31.764
It's a little smaller
than the old one,

20:31.864 --> 20:34.233
but this one has
picture-in-picture.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.768
Mm. (chuckles)

20:35.902 --> 20:37.270
What'd you do
with the old one?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.105
Oh, well, you've been
complaining about it forever,

20:39.205 --> 20:40.640
so I found it a new home.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.476
Well, this is funny.
 He's a loving, precious son.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.111
He's the one
 who's gonna need therapy.

20:45.211 --> 20:47.414
Kathie Lee sure knows how
to start a day, huh?

20:47.514 --> 20:50.417
Anyway, so he [laughs]

20:58.325 --> 20:59.258
(sighs)

20:59.359 --> 21:01.794
Hey, buddy!
I'm just here to collect.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.597
Oh. Gosh.
Did we bet on something?

21:04.697 --> 21:07.166
$50, little man.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.336
You're not really gonna
make me pay,

21:09.436 --> 21:10.870
are you, Uncle Marvin?

21:10.970 --> 21:13.440
**

21:21.381 --> 21:24.851
I want those wheels to shine
like Liberace's bathtub.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.019
Stupid fish wrestler.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.356
Always bet on bass.

21:29.456 --> 21:30.990
(chuckles)
