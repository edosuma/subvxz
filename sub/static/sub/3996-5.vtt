WEBVTT

00:05.037 --> 00:06.705
Cece!

00:08.708 --> 00:10.709
Beep-beep.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.846
Beep-beep.

00:14.914 --> 00:16.548
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

00:16.616 --> 00:19.217
These traffic patterns
are really...

00:19.584 --> 00:21.986
counterintuitive!

00:22.354 --> 00:23.922
Really...

00:23.989 --> 00:27.725
Catch-as-catch-can as far
as footpaths go over here!

00:30.562 --> 00:31.595
Cece!

00:32.531 --> 00:33.497
I got your text.

00:33.565 --> 00:34.598
Are you ready to go home?

00:34.666 --> 00:36.233
Argh! Thank you for coming.

00:36.301 --> 00:38.601
Jess, he was making
out with another girl.

00:38.669 --> 00:41.738
You... get away from here.

00:41.806 --> 00:43.340
Okay, who are you,
Miss Pajama, okay?

00:43.408 --> 00:44.942
You're blocking my booth.
Get out of here!

00:45.009 --> 00:46.043
Don't talk to her
like that, okay?

00:46.110 --> 00:46.977
That is my best friend!

00:49.314 --> 00:50.113
Oh, Cece...

00:50.181 --> 00:52.448
You ripped my deep V!

00:52.515 --> 00:54.317
This is my favorite deep V!

00:54.384 --> 00:57.386
It's just a deeper V.

00:57.454 --> 00:59.055
Thanks for picking me up, Jess.

00:59.122 --> 01:01.424
I really felt that
Gavin was different.

01:01.491 --> 01:03.826
Didn't you feel like
he was different?

01:03.893 --> 01:04.828
Yeah.

01:04.894 --> 01:07.529
I mean, he seemed
like a really nice...

01:07.597 --> 01:09.797
European DJ with a face tattoo.

01:09.798 --> 01:11.032
Whoo!

01:11.100 --> 01:12.033
Hey, guys.

01:12.101 --> 01:14.202
I think... Jess, I think
these guys are into you.

01:14.270 --> 01:16.137
We should, we should
just go back, right?

01:16.205 --> 01:17.439
We should totally head back.

01:17.507 --> 01:19.541
Where am I taking you?

01:19.609 --> 01:21.643
Well, can't go home

01:21.711 --> 01:23.511
because Gavin's, like,
staying at my place.

01:23.579 --> 01:24.680
You've known him
for three weeks.

01:24.747 --> 01:27.849
Can I just crash with you
for a couple days? Please?

01:27.916 --> 01:29.817
I don't know.
It's Friday night.

01:29.885 --> 01:32.587
The guys probably
have big plans.

01:41.496 --> 01:43.029
Friday night, gentlemen.

01:43.097 --> 01:45.399
- It's on.
- What happened to you?

01:45.466 --> 01:47.201
It's on and poppin' up
in here, you feel?

01:47.268 --> 01:48.535
- What happened to you?
- What?

01:48.603 --> 01:50.170
You didn't used to be
like this, Schmidt.

01:50.238 --> 01:51.037
What are you talking about?

01:51.105 --> 01:52.072
You've gotten so much worse.

01:52.139 --> 01:53.373
It's on and poppin'!

02:00.414 --> 02:01.947
Yes. I told you
I'd come through.

02:02.015 --> 02:03.849
Okay, Benjamin just invited us
to a very cool party.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.884
I just got off three
back-to-back shifts at the bar.

02:05.952 --> 02:07.152
I just want to sit here

02:07.221 --> 02:08.987
all weekend in silence
playing this game,

02:09.055 --> 02:11.590
then I want to go in my room and
do weird stuff on my computer.

02:11.657 --> 02:12.890
Are you even wearing underwear?

02:12.958 --> 02:14.259
What is between
you and that chair?

02:14.827 --> 02:16.027
Just a little bit of sunshine.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.995
All right, take off
that kimono, please.

02:18.063 --> 02:19.831
It's my leisure wear, Winston.

02:19.898 --> 02:21.866
Look, I worked
80 hours this week.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.835
I just want to come home,
put on my 'mono

02:23.902 --> 02:25.503
and just hang loose, man.

02:25.571 --> 02:27.105
Okay? If you had a job,
you'd understand.

02:29.241 --> 02:30.140
R-Really?

02:30.208 --> 02:32.109
Wow! It just got real in here.

02:32.176 --> 02:33.810
Okay, you're not gonna
take the kimono off?

02:33.878 --> 02:35.679
Fine. Then I'm not
wearing any pants.

02:35.747 --> 02:37.715
Boom! Bam!

02:37.782 --> 02:39.250
Mm-hmm. Everybody want
to just walk around

02:39.317 --> 02:40.851
this house wearing all
kinds of stupid stuff,

02:41.418 --> 02:43.120
then guess what
I'm gonna do, Schmidt.

02:43.187 --> 02:46.021
I'm wearing a napkin
on my face.

02:46.089 --> 02:48.090
Bam! How you like that?

02:48.158 --> 02:49.292
That doesn't even
make any sense, Winston.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.093
It makes perfect sense.

02:51.161 --> 02:52.695
Totally different than
me wearing my kimono.

02:52.763 --> 02:54.264
You are laughing in the face of

02:54.331 --> 02:55.865
thousands of years
of samurai culture,

02:55.932 --> 02:57.433
and it's an affront,
Winston, it's an affront.

02:57.501 --> 02:58.934
Look at me now, huh?
This is the vibe

02:59.002 --> 03:00.869
we have in the house
now because of you.

03:00.936 --> 03:01.971
You want to walk around
here looking silly.

03:01.972 --> 03:04.239
This is handcrafted!
In China.

03:07.910 --> 03:10.111
Schmidt, I think you should
take the kimono off.

03:13.348 --> 03:16.850
Um, Cece, can you not
do your usual thing?

03:16.918 --> 03:17.951
These are really good guys.

03:18.019 --> 03:19.219
Best behavior.

03:19.788 --> 03:20.521
Sure.

03:20.589 --> 03:22.356
Hey, guys, I brought...

03:22.424 --> 03:23.791
You brought this on yourself!

03:24.959 --> 03:27.895
What you doing?

03:27.962 --> 03:29.397
Oh, you know, we're
just chillin'.

03:29.464 --> 03:30.798
Just chillin'.

03:30.865 --> 03:31.798
Just doing this.

03:31.865 --> 03:33.166
You know, Friday night.

03:33.233 --> 03:34.834
I'm gonna use the ladies'.

03:34.902 --> 03:35.835
What's up, Cecelia?

03:36.403 --> 03:37.304
Where's the tequila?

03:39.473 --> 03:42.409
Guys.

03:42.476 --> 03:44.110
Okay.

03:44.178 --> 03:46.112
I would normally
never bring her here,

03:46.180 --> 03:48.013
but Cece's really vulnerable
right now,

03:48.080 --> 03:50.683
and when she's drunk,
she has no boundaries.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.018
So she's really grabby,
really physical,

03:53.085 --> 03:54.720
she's really loose
with her body.

03:54.788 --> 03:58.290
So I just want to apologize
in advance for anything

03:58.358 --> 03:59.958
that she might do.

04:00.026 --> 04:01.760
- That's good to know.
- Yeah, thanks for telling us.

04:01.828 --> 04:02.894
Thank you, guys.

04:03.462 --> 04:04.595
You're the best.

04:12.905 --> 04:14.840
This is the opposite
of being alone!

04:16.209 --> 04:18.709
This is the opposite
of what I wanted this weekend.

04:19.277 --> 04:21.846
Wow, how'd this happen?

04:21.913 --> 04:23.548
Okay, I'm not
a part of this, Schmidt.

04:23.615 --> 04:25.082
I'm not a part of this.

04:25.650 --> 04:26.718
Hi, Cece.

04:26.785 --> 04:29.086
I'm gonna make you a bed
on the couch, okay?

04:29.154 --> 04:31.789
You have to stop dancing,
okay, so you can go to sleep.

04:31.857 --> 04:34.559
You know, Cece, I think
you should dance if you want to.

04:34.626 --> 04:35.926
Why are you talking like that?

04:35.994 --> 04:37.694
Like what?
I'm just hanging out.

04:37.762 --> 04:39.429
- You get up.
- Really? Him?

04:39.497 --> 04:40.997
But I'm doing this.

04:43.234 --> 04:44.568
- Come on, get up!
- No, I don't dance.

04:44.635 --> 04:45.769
I'm from the town in Footloose.

04:45.837 --> 04:47.237
He doesn't want to dance, Cece.

04:47.304 --> 04:48.538
I don't wanna dance.
I'm really good.

04:48.606 --> 04:50.540
Schmidt dances...
Whoa! What the...

04:50.608 --> 04:53.843
All right, you know what,
I'm gonna go to bed. Good night.

04:54.410 --> 04:55.878
That's really not
great under here.

04:55.945 --> 04:56.746
You have to love hair.

04:58.313 --> 04:59.648
I think it's time for bed.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.783
You can use my bed;
I'll sleep on the couch.

05:00.851 --> 05:02.317
Over here. Over here, Cece.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.419
Oh.

05:03.487 --> 05:05.220
Over here. Over here.

05:05.288 --> 05:06.989
Are you sheepdogging her?

05:07.056 --> 05:08.023
Over here, over here.

05:08.091 --> 05:08.956
Over here, over here.

05:09.024 --> 05:09.858
Not here. Here we go.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.763
Good night, Cece.

05:16.465 --> 05:17.799
Yes! Yes.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.701
She is sleeping
on my sheets right now.

05:19.769 --> 05:21.503
Not yours, bro. Mine.

05:23.171 --> 05:24.171
Parkour!

05:28.109 --> 05:29.175
You know what?
I think I might

05:29.243 --> 05:30.110
actually have a
chance with her.

05:31.377 --> 05:32.112
I just have to be

05:32.179 --> 05:33.313
cooler than that guy.

05:33.381 --> 05:34.782
Parkour!

05:34.849 --> 05:36.817
A wise man once foretold
of a magical night

05:36.885 --> 05:37.851
where I would engage
in nonsexual foreplay

05:37.919 --> 05:39.486
with a model, my friends.

05:39.554 --> 05:40.986
And tonight...

05:41.054 --> 05:42.555
- Don't say...
- ...is that night.

05:42.623 --> 05:44.023
No, not a chance.
Never gonna happen.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.391
You're not a closer.

05:45.459 --> 05:46.726
Oh, I'm a closer.
I'm gonna close

05:46.794 --> 05:48.428
this conversation
right now, my brother.

05:48.495 --> 05:50.362
Watch this. Boom, bam, closed.

05:51.331 --> 05:52.131
Parkour!

05:52.198 --> 05:53.833
Short track speed skating.

05:54.401 --> 05:55.768
Apolo Ohno.

06:00.139 --> 06:01.673
Well, at least
this tires him out, right?

06:01.741 --> 06:02.607
Yeah.

06:06.285 --> 06:07.851
Look, she's great.
You're gonna love her.

06:08.219 --> 06:09.019
Do you want some eggs?

06:09.087 --> 06:10.287
No, I've got my own breakfast.

06:10.354 --> 06:11.622
I don't need you to...

06:11.690 --> 06:12.556
- What?
- I don't know.

06:12.624 --> 06:13.523
Take care of me.

06:14.592 --> 06:16.026
Just stop being so nice.

06:16.094 --> 06:17.827
Your mother's being so nice.

06:19.395 --> 06:20.630
Slam on my mother.

06:20.698 --> 06:21.664
Your mother's gonna

06:21.732 --> 06:22.632
slam on your mother.

06:29.573 --> 06:31.340
And 4,000.

06:31.408 --> 06:32.741
Yeah.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.743
Oh, my God.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.311
Wilkommen.

06:36.878 --> 06:37.980
You're covered in oil?

06:38.047 --> 06:39.214
What, oil? No.

06:39.281 --> 06:42.084
This is just, uh...

06:43.651 --> 06:44.920
You okay?

06:45.388 --> 06:46.387
Schmidt.

06:46.755 --> 06:48.523
Hey, are you okay?

06:48.591 --> 06:50.391
Whoa. Whoa.

06:50.459 --> 06:51.892
I just blacked out
for a second.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.461
Anything weird happen?

06:53.529 --> 06:56.030
Okay, I need some
water, so can you move?

06:56.098 --> 06:57.499
Yeah, that's not
gonna happen, honey.

06:57.566 --> 06:59.400
Just, you know, slide me
like a curtain, okay?

07:01.870 --> 07:03.904
There you go.
I'm good. I'm good.

07:03.972 --> 07:05.106
Sweet.

07:05.173 --> 07:07.508
Hey, can you get me a coff...

07:19.754 --> 07:20.787
What's going on, guys? I--

07:20.855 --> 07:23.889
Hey. Oh, you're all here.

07:23.957 --> 07:25.291
Um, does the water gets
any hotter than this?

07:25.359 --> 07:27.726
Uh, do you want me...

07:27.794 --> 07:30.696
Uh I mean, I could
give you, if...

07:30.797 --> 07:31.830
I could...
I'm good at fixing

07:31.898 --> 07:33.599
I can fix it, also.

07:33.667 --> 07:34.801
Actually, you know what,

07:34.869 --> 07:35.935
I'll just figure it out myself.

07:36.003 --> 07:37.370
But do you guys have
any actual soap?

07:37.437 --> 07:39.805
Because all I can find
in here is body gelato.

07:39.806 --> 07:41.105
- That would be Schmidt's--
- Schmidt's gelato.

07:41.106 --> 07:42.040
That gelato is mine.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.675
If you could just...
Don't use it all.

07:43.709 --> 07:44.976
- I'll just not touch it.
- Okay.

07:45.044 --> 07:47.312
Hey. Why are you guys
all in here?

07:47.413 --> 07:48.346
I'm brushing my teeth.

07:48.447 --> 07:49.881
D-Doing my thing.

07:49.948 --> 07:51.583
She hogging the shower?
Cece come on. Hurry up.

07:51.651 --> 07:52.551
Sorry, j just... I can't find

07:52.618 --> 07:54.418
any bigger towels
for some reason.

07:59.157 --> 08:00.658
You have a really
beautiful body, Cece.

08:00.692 --> 08:02.059
I really appreciate that
about you.

08:02.126 --> 08:03.360
Okay, come on.

08:03.428 --> 08:05.028
- I did you breakfast.
- You did?

08:05.096 --> 08:06.063
Yeah.

08:06.130 --> 08:07.398
Sorry. I just...

08:12.102 --> 08:13.403
Disappointed with all of you.

08:13.470 --> 08:15.004
- Especially you.
- It was a bad moment.

08:15.105 --> 08:16.639
I thought you were
better than that.

08:16.707 --> 08:18.974
I know. I am
sometimes.

08:19.042 --> 08:20.443
Did you see that cleavage?

08:20.511 --> 08:22.378
I just want to get
my arm stuck down there.

08:22.446 --> 08:24.046
127 Hours style.

08:24.114 --> 08:26.381
And then, and then...

08:26.449 --> 08:27.982
Just cut it for days.
I don't care.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.518
I'll cut through
the bone, the nerve.

08:30.620 --> 08:31.820
Schmidt!

08:31.887 --> 08:33.121
You weren't upset 'cause

08:33.188 --> 08:34.121
I was dancing with Nick, right?

08:34.190 --> 08:35.657
No, of course not.

08:35.725 --> 08:37.491
'Cause I think
he's really into you.

08:37.559 --> 08:38.960
Nick?!
No.

08:39.528 --> 08:40.596
- No!
- Come on, Jess.

08:40.663 --> 08:42.096
This is classic Eduardo.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.367
You want this to go
to Cece, right?

08:46.401 --> 08:47.501
"Jess."

08:47.569 --> 08:49.337
Okay, I'll give it to Cece.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.772
No. Jess!

08:51.840 --> 08:53.140
You don't want me
to give it to Cece?

08:53.208 --> 08:55.576
Sí, sí... uh, for you.

08:55.644 --> 08:56.777
For me?

08:57.045 --> 08:59.078
To give to Cece.

09:00.615 --> 09:01.514
We're just friends.

09:01.582 --> 09:03.717
You can't be friends
with these guys.

09:03.784 --> 09:05.185
You don't think that
every single one of them

09:05.253 --> 09:06.419
has thought about
sleeping with you?

09:06.487 --> 09:07.755
No, you just think
everyone wants

09:07.822 --> 09:09.289
to sleep with everyone
all the time.

09:09.357 --> 09:10.991
They do. That's
why I think that.

09:11.059 --> 09:12.726
Don't you hear how
he says your name?

09:13.193 --> 09:14.026
"Jess."

09:14.094 --> 09:15.427
He's from Chicago.

09:15.495 --> 09:17.496
That's how people
from Chicago say "Jess."

09:17.564 --> 09:19.465
Like "Bears" and "milk"

09:19.532 --> 09:21.133
and "Let's go visit
the Sears Tower."

09:23.201 --> 09:24.035
Hey, Jess.

09:24.103 --> 09:24.936
I'm going to the drugstore.

09:25.004 --> 09:26.037
- Need anything?
- Yes.

09:26.105 --> 09:27.373
Jess, you should go with him,

09:27.440 --> 09:30.207
'cause then you can get that
thing that you really need.

09:31.343 --> 09:32.244
Oh, I wonder what that is.

09:32.311 --> 09:34.445
She'll be right out.

09:34.513 --> 09:36.581
Yeah, just...

09:36.649 --> 09:38.816
No. No!

09:38.884 --> 09:41.051
No, you are not coming in here
and ruining all this.

09:41.119 --> 09:42.086
I'm happy,

09:42.154 --> 09:43.221
I like these guys, and I think

09:43.289 --> 09:45.222
they're actually
starting to like me, too.

09:45.290 --> 09:46.856
Who did you tell me
was your perfect man?

09:46.924 --> 09:48.625
Walter Matthau
in Grumpy Old Men.

09:48.693 --> 09:50.494
And I could be
girl Jack Lemmon.

09:50.561 --> 09:51.395
He's a total Matthau!

09:51.462 --> 09:53.363
I'm telling you, he gets you.

09:53.431 --> 09:54.265
And did you see his feet?

09:54.332 --> 09:56.099
A guy's feet point
at what they want.

09:56.167 --> 09:57.034
His feet were pointing
right at you.

09:57.102 --> 09:58.368
Why wouldn't his feet
point at me?

09:58.436 --> 09:59.770
Otherwise, he's standing
like a duck.

09:59.838 --> 10:01.337
Just come on. Go.
Get out there.

10:01.405 --> 10:02.438
Hey, you ready?

10:02.506 --> 10:03.406
Come on!

10:03.473 --> 10:04.774
Be there in a sec, bro!

10:05.042 --> 10:06.342
You just call me "bro"?

10:08.244 --> 10:09.345
Yeah.

10:09.413 --> 10:11.980
Well, how long is she staying?

10:12.048 --> 10:13.849
Oh, not long.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.884
I know she can be
tough to deal with.

10:15.952 --> 10:17.219
Sometimes she just calls me up

10:17.287 --> 10:18.920
and she's like,
"Bitch, I love you."

10:18.987 --> 10:20.288
And then she just hangs up.

10:20.356 --> 10:21.423
No other information.

10:21.490 --> 10:22.590
Weird.

10:25.260 --> 10:27.429
But I don't know, I kind of like
it when she calls me "bitch."

10:27.496 --> 10:29.597
It makes me feel like
Janis Joplin.

10:29.665 --> 10:32.099
Fine, but does she
have to stay with us?

10:33.868 --> 10:35.001
What? I'm sorry.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.570
What-What did you say?

10:36.638 --> 10:38.405
I'm saying stop trying
to take care of everyone.

10:39.341 --> 10:40.708
- Oh, my God.
- What?

10:40.775 --> 10:42.476
What? - What!
Nothing. What?

10:42.544 --> 10:44.812
What?

10:44.879 --> 10:46.079
What are you doing?

10:49.317 --> 10:50.083
I know she's your best friend,

10:50.151 --> 10:51.718
but I-I didn't mean
to insult you.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.686
Just, you don't have to
take care of her...

10:53.754 --> 10:55.355
Okay.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.090
Yes.

10:57.158 --> 10:58.624
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

10:58.692 --> 10:59.792
I'm sorry, I'm just checking...

10:59.861 --> 11:00.827
I just want to make sure...

11:00.895 --> 11:01.995
If I insulted you, I'm sorry.

11:02.063 --> 11:03.230
But what are you doing
right now?

11:03.297 --> 11:04.297
Everything's in its place.

11:04.365 --> 11:05.797
- What does that mean?
- Okay.

11:05.866 --> 11:07.566
I'm just walking like a friend.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.434
Okay, you know what,
forget this.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.203
Let's get out of here.
Last on the list...

11:11.271 --> 11:12.204
toilet paper.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.539
Um, I don't use it.

11:15.607 --> 11:16.775
You don't use toilet paper?

11:19.179 --> 11:21.912
I mean...
That's not what I meant.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.847
That's what your mother meant.

11:23.915 --> 11:25.316
What, did my mother call?
What did she say?

11:25.384 --> 11:27.418
No, Jess, I was... Jess,

11:27.986 --> 11:29.387
I was joking.

11:34.393 --> 11:35.860
Look at her.

11:36.928 --> 11:38.595
Go for it, man.
You know, go do your thing.

11:38.662 --> 11:41.164
I don't like the roof, man.
There's a cat up here.

11:41.232 --> 11:43.166
It's crazy.
It was raised by birds.

11:43.734 --> 11:44.935
You mean to tell me
you're going to let a cat

11:45.003 --> 11:47.371
- stop you from all that?
- It's a bird-cat, man.

11:47.438 --> 11:48.738
It's very dangerous.
Look it up. Double rabies.

11:48.806 --> 11:50.840
Right. You can't close.

11:54.344 --> 11:57.179
You just said
the magic words, son.

11:57.747 --> 11:59.114
Baby, baby, don't cry.

11:59.182 --> 12:00.616
Look, I get it.

12:00.683 --> 12:02.919
I was the best
lover you ever had.

12:02.986 --> 12:07.055
Yeah. A 90-minute session's
pretty standard for me.

12:10.025 --> 12:11.259
It was god what?

12:11.827 --> 12:13.194
Oh, it was godlike.

12:14.262 --> 12:15.495
That's very sweet
of you to say.

12:18.533 --> 12:19.833
My bad.

12:20.168 --> 12:21.501
Pocket dialed you.

12:21.569 --> 12:24.372
I got dropped calls, then Winston calls.
It's crazy.

12:24.440 --> 12:27.507
Uh, the roof,
you know what I mean?

12:29.977 --> 12:31.344
Hey, look, if he's
ever bothering you...

12:31.412 --> 12:33.280
- You both are.
- Cool, that's cool.

12:39.886 --> 12:41.020
Okay, what's going on
with you, Jess?

12:41.088 --> 12:42.788
- Why do you have to do that?
- Do what?

12:42.856 --> 12:44.790
Why do you have to say
my name like that? "Jess."

12:44.858 --> 12:47.660
And why do you have to wear
old man clothes all the time?

12:47.727 --> 12:50.529
I don't wear old man clothes.
You don't like the way I dress?

12:50.597 --> 12:51.297
No, I just...

12:51.365 --> 12:52.765
Did I do something to you?

12:52.833 --> 12:55.068
No, I just need air.

12:55.935 --> 12:56.769
- Rose for the lady?
- No.

12:56.837 --> 12:59.237
Okay, I'll buy you one. Or two...
they come as two? - No, no.

12:59.238 --> 13:01.139
I'll buy two. - No, no.
Great. Thank you.

13:01.207 --> 13:02.474
Wait, what do you mean no?
Here, take some roses.

13:02.541 --> 13:04.376
Want 'em? It's two dollars,
it's not a big deal.

13:04.444 --> 13:05.744
- I want them to go, no.
- They're nice roses...

13:05.745 --> 13:07.946
Hey, what are you doing?!
Where are you going?

13:08.514 --> 13:09.547
Jess, it was a joke.

13:09.615 --> 13:12.917
What are you doing?
Get back in the car.

13:12.985 --> 13:14.818
Where are you going?

13:19.823 --> 13:21.224
That's not the way home.

13:26.318 --> 13:27.719
Just working on Saturday.

13:27.787 --> 13:29.987
Pulling in them ducats.
It's crazy.

13:30.055 --> 13:31.790
It's like golden handcuffs,
you know what I mean?

13:31.857 --> 13:33.224
It's like, on one hand

13:33.292 --> 13:35.059
I'm killing myself,
and on the other hand,

13:35.127 --> 13:36.694
I'm making all
this baller dough.

13:36.762 --> 13:38.129
Ow!

13:38.996 --> 13:40.031
Sunburn.

13:40.998 --> 13:42.599
I told you to take
that oil off.

13:42.667 --> 13:44.100
It's cool, man.
It's just a little color.

13:44.168 --> 13:47.571
In a couple days I'll be brown
just like you, Cece.

13:48.139 --> 13:49.640
Because...
because your culture is...

13:49.707 --> 13:50.641
What is my culture?

13:50.708 --> 13:54.311
It's, um... you're... Fff...

13:54.378 --> 13:57.147
Um... Jjj... Jaflan...

13:57.714 --> 13:59.014
Jafanese?

13:59.082 --> 14:00.983
Uh, Sa-Saudi...

14:01.051 --> 14:01.851
Saudiboo...

14:01.919 --> 14:03.385
Um...

14:04.854 --> 14:05.755
Monga...

14:05.823 --> 14:07.523
My parents were born in India.

14:07.591 --> 14:09.024
India... totally.
Love India.

14:09.092 --> 14:10.560
He really does.

14:10.627 --> 14:12.495
Hey, Schmidt, why don't
you tell her about

14:12.563 --> 14:14.329
all the things
you love about India.

14:16.766 --> 14:19.868
Uh, sure. I love, you know,
uh, I love Slumdog.

14:19.936 --> 14:21.937
I love naan,

14:22.004 --> 14:23.805
uh, pepper, Ben Kingsley,

14:23.873 --> 14:25.540
the stories of Rudyard Kipling.

14:25.608 --> 14:27.843
I have respect for cows,
of course.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.779
I love, uh, the
Taj Mahal, Deepak Chopra,

14:31.847 --> 14:33.848
anyone named Patel.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.816
I love monsoons.

14:35.884 --> 14:37.751
I love...
I love cobras and baskets,

14:37.819 --> 14:39.854
Naveen Andrews.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.357
I love mango chutney, uh,
really, any type of chutney.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.859
- Teepees...
- Hey, Schmidt, take a lap. Refresh.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.526
Yep.

14:49.895 --> 14:50.829
- That was pretty good.
- I know.

14:50.897 --> 14:51.931
You're working a little
too hard, though.

14:51.999 --> 14:53.566
Watch this.
Schmidt!

14:53.633 --> 14:55.668
- Yo.
- Go up to the roof.

14:56.236 --> 14:57.770
Yeah, I'm going to go
up to the roof.

14:57.838 --> 15:00.840
- I'll be there in ten minutes.
- Cool. See you in, like, ten.

15:01.408 --> 15:03.008
- That was absolutely...
- Make me a sandwich.

15:03.075 --> 15:04.142
Sandwich.

15:06.445 --> 15:08.880
I walked home.

15:09.347 --> 15:10.883
I got out of the car
and I walked home.

15:10.950 --> 15:12.350
Why, what happened?

15:12.418 --> 15:15.320
His feet were pointed directly
at me the whole time.

15:15.388 --> 15:17.122
Did I do this?
Am I dressing

15:17.189 --> 15:19.857
too provocatively? Do I need
to get thicker pajamas?

15:19.925 --> 15:21.926
Maybe it's my posture.
I have really sexy posture.

15:21.994 --> 15:23.460
Don't worry about it.

15:23.529 --> 15:25.162
I will talk to him for you.

15:25.230 --> 15:27.131
No, you won't.
That would be the worst,

15:27.198 --> 15:28.132
most life-ruining thing
you could possibly...

15:28.199 --> 15:30.034
- Hi, Nick.
- Seriously, Jess,

15:30.101 --> 15:32.202
what the hell happened?
I've been driving around

15:32.270 --> 15:33.837
for the last hour
looking for you.

15:33.905 --> 15:36.105
Everything is okay, and
we were hoping to get

15:36.173 --> 15:37.874
- everything out...
- on the table.

15:37.942 --> 15:39.976
The table which is not
a table, it doesn't exist.

15:40.044 --> 15:41.277
Don't worry about the table.

15:41.345 --> 15:42.846
We were in the
middle of traffic

15:42.914 --> 15:44.414
and you just got out
and ran away.

15:44.481 --> 15:45.782
I was hot.

15:45.850 --> 15:47.517
You were so hot that you

15:47.585 --> 15:50.252
had to jump out
of my car and run?

15:50.319 --> 15:51.420
Why are you standing like that?

15:51.487 --> 15:52.888
This is how I stand.

15:52.956 --> 15:53.989
I've never seen you
stand like that.

15:54.057 --> 15:55.791
I was really worried

15:55.859 --> 15:57.292
something had
happened to you, okay?

15:57.360 --> 15:59.294
And you can't just walk
around this neighborhood

15:59.362 --> 16:03.098
with bags full of toilet paper,
that you don't even use.

16:03.166 --> 16:04.233
What?

16:04.266 --> 16:06.233
I told him I don't
use toilet paper.

16:07.401 --> 16:09.336
Okay, do you hear
what he is saying to you?

16:09.404 --> 16:10.503
Yes, I hear what he's saying--

16:10.504 --> 16:12.506
He's trying to tell you
he cares about you.

16:12.575 --> 16:13.575
No, he doesn't care about me.

16:13.576 --> 16:14.775
So I'm going to make
this happen for you.

16:14.776 --> 16:16.544
- He cares about me as a friend.
- This is so on, Jess.

16:16.612 --> 16:18.580
- No, it is not.
- No, on it is not.

16:18.647 --> 16:20.481
- I'm trying to help you...
- No.

16:20.549 --> 16:22.282
- No.
- Okay, my face is my job.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.017
My face is my job.

16:24.085 --> 16:25.118
Okay...

16:26.921 --> 16:29.322
No! No!

16:29.390 --> 16:31.191
- My earring.
- Okay.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.425
It is stuck in your hair.

16:32.493 --> 16:34.962
- Can you get it out?
- No.

16:35.529 --> 16:37.030
Okay, we'll do it on the floor.
We can do it on the floor. - Ow...

16:37.098 --> 16:38.631
We're going to get it on the
floor, don't worry. Okay.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.700
- Ow. - It'll be okay.
All right, here we go.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.335
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm trying to help you.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.335
No, what is wrong with you?

16:43.403 --> 16:44.536
No. I don't need your help.

16:44.605 --> 16:46.072
You don't know...
Nick and I are friends.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.674
You don't know, 'cause you
don't have guy friends at all.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.442
You just hang out
with jerks like Gavin.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.812
Oh, I'm sorry...
DJ Diabeat It.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.847
- He has diabetes.
- Oh, he does? Boo-hoo.

16:56.415 --> 16:59.050
I'm sorry. Is it really bad?
I feel really bad.

16:59.118 --> 17:00.885
He's fine.
He takes medication.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.121
Why do you just come in
and you take over?

17:03.888 --> 17:05.824
It's like you're playing
mind games with people.

17:05.891 --> 17:09.160
Don't put this on me, Jess. Ok, I'm trying
to help you. You never make a move...

17:09.228 --> 17:10.595
Well, I don't need your help.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.230
I like moving slow.
I like being weird and taking my time.

17:13.297 --> 17:14.632
I'm not like you.

17:14.699 --> 17:16.299
I don't just jump
in the potato sack

17:16.367 --> 17:19.603
with the first potato that
I meet with diabetes.

17:19.671 --> 17:22.640
- Okay, what did you just say?
- You heard me, bitch.

17:26.877 --> 17:28.845
Oh...

17:28.912 --> 17:30.479
- What is that?
- Oh, no.

17:30.547 --> 17:31.815
- What, what did you do?
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.115
What did you do?

17:46.531 --> 17:49.433
Hey, Schmidt.
How you doing?

17:49.501 --> 17:52.536
Can I sit with you
on your cooler here?

17:52.604 --> 17:54.538
Yeah. Just chillin',
hanging with the cat.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.107
Hola.

17:57.175 --> 17:59.009
I'm sorry that Cece
did this to you.

17:59.076 --> 18:02.179
That's okay.
I'm used to it.

18:02.246 --> 18:04.781
I guess I'll just always be the
fat kid with the big dreams.

18:04.849 --> 18:05.982
It's not you.

18:06.050 --> 18:08.451
I love Cece, but she's
not ready for you.

18:08.519 --> 18:10.753
You're a good guy,

18:10.822 --> 18:13.823
You know, if you ignore everything
that you do on purpose,

18:13.857 --> 18:16.725
and concentrate on all of the
things that you do by accident.

18:17.493 --> 18:18.861
Thank you.

18:20.163 --> 18:21.864
She'd eat you up.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.301
You really think
she'd eat me up?

18:25.369 --> 18:26.803
Yeah.

18:26.870 --> 18:28.737
Like buffet style?

18:28.805 --> 18:29.938
You know, all you can eat?

18:30.105 --> 18:32.440
'cause I got that prime rib, yo.

18:33.007 --> 18:34.343
Carving station,

18:34.410 --> 18:36.411
plates are warm, sneeze guard,

18:36.479 --> 18:39.147
kids eat for free.
I mean, except for the...

18:39.215 --> 18:41.182
Except for the last...

18:41.250 --> 18:43.785
All right, let's go.
Let's go, Schmidt, okay?

18:43.853 --> 18:44.852
Okay.

18:49.691 --> 18:52.159
Hey, Cece. Um...

18:52.727 --> 18:57.064
Look, I get it.
This isn't going to happen.

18:57.631 --> 18:59.500
But the couch is
super uncomfortable,

19:00.268 --> 19:02.168
my sunburn's starting
to blister, and

19:02.736 --> 19:04.704
I just want to sleep
in my own bed.

19:05.472 --> 19:06.538
Okay.

19:24.389 --> 19:26.390
I'm sorry for everything.

19:28.027 --> 19:30.295
I can be a jerk sometimes.

19:38.271 --> 19:40.204
I hate sleeping alone.

19:42.239 --> 19:43.607
Me too.

19:44.174 --> 19:45.242
Sweet.

19:49.146 --> 19:51.081
Sch-weet...

19:51.149 --> 19:52.149
Better when you don't talk.

19:52.217 --> 19:54.084
Yeah.

20:02.726 --> 20:04.260
If you tell anyone
we held hands,

20:04.328 --> 20:06.495
I have two people in my phone
that will kill you.

20:07.263 --> 20:08.564
Literally.

20:23.947 --> 20:25.948
- Hmm...
- Oh.

20:42.463 --> 20:45.665
Hey.

20:46.232 --> 20:50.203
I'm sorry I acted
so weird today. Weird!

20:50.771 --> 20:52.204
It's okay.

21:07.819 --> 21:08.988
- Yo.
- I did it, man.

21:09.055 --> 21:10.722
I'm holding her hand right now.
She's in my bed

21:10.790 --> 21:12.324
and she's asleep.

21:12.392 --> 21:14.960
Wait, so you're in...
you're in the room right now?

21:15.028 --> 21:18.162
What is wrong with you?
Hang up the phone.

21:18.230 --> 21:19.797
I did it. I closed.

21:19.865 --> 21:22.033
We could have this
conversation at any time.

21:22.101 --> 21:25.136
Shh. Please, shh.

21:25.904 --> 21:26.937
Okay, we're good.

21:27.006 --> 21:28.473
And just so we're clear,
when I say "closing,"

21:28.540 --> 21:29.974
this is not
what I'm talking about.

21:30.042 --> 21:31.609
You need to define your terms.

21:31.676 --> 21:35.979
Because what I'm doing right now
feels an awful lot like closing.
