00:27.945 --> 00:29.230
- Chris.
- Dad!

00:29.404 --> 00:31.065
What do you see out there?

00:32.407 --> 00:33.738
I told you to stop looking.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.571
Some guy, he was--
he was messed up, Dad.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.906
Just come away
from the window.

00:39.081 --> 00:42.915

What was that sound?

01:23.417 --> 01:25.203
I don't know, but it's gone.

01:26.295 --> 01:27.785
What did Mr. Dawson do
to the Cruzes?

01:27.963 --> 01:29.794
- He's gone.
- Yeah, but what the hell did he do?

01:29.965 --> 01:32.331
Madison: I don't know.
We're safe inside, okay?

01:33.969 --> 01:36.301
Oh, come on, Nick.
Please, just swallow them.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.632
No, it takes too long to absorb.
I'm not there yet.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.298
The idea is to wean you
off of the pills, not to get--

01:41.476 --> 01:43.558
Um, who's the expert?

01:46.690 --> 01:49.147
Hey, Mom, I need more.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.354
No shit.
Later.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.938
Well, how much do we have?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.570
We have enough to get you east.
Don't worry.

01:55.741 --> 01:58.323

- And then you how! at the moon.

01:59.578 --> 02:01.660
Look, Travis will be here.
We'll go.

He's coming.

Okay.

02:19.348 --> 02:22.215
As soon as this settles down,
we move.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.883
Go back the way we came,
get to the truck, and we're gone.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.773
Chris: We're gonna go back
to Madison's after this?

02:28.940 --> 02:30.350
- Yeah.
- Why can't we just leave?

02:30.525 --> 02:32.311
Just us.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.771
- Chris...
-( banging)

02:33.945 --> 02:36.402

They're breaking in next door.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.698
( clamoring )

02:43.872 --> 02:45.828
Well, we're safe here.
They won't come in here.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.330
Liza:
How do you know?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.992
What are they
gonna steal, combs?

02:50.170 --> 02:52.377
The police will have it sorted
in an hour, two tops.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.503
You said that two hours ago.

02:54.675 --> 02:58.167
- Can I use your phone again?
- Ofelia: I'll get it.

03:01.431 --> 03:04.548

(distant banging )

03:23.745 --> 03:26.953
(man whooping )

03:27.124 --> 03:30.958
There's more than combs here,
you know.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.959
I know.
I was just trying to make--

03:33.130 --> 03:36.588
Yeah, make your boy believe
everything's gonna be fine.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.044
What happens
if what's out there gets in here?

03:39.219 --> 03:40.675
We run.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.928
Where?

03:43.098 --> 03:45.555
In different directions.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.466

Dad.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.226

We've got to go.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.271
(speaking Spanish )

03:57.446 --> 03:59.732
( alarm continues )

03:59.906 --> 04:01.692
All right,
we get out of here.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.949
We stay close.
Get to the truck.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.405
- Okay.
- Daniel: La plata, el dinero...

04:06.580 --> 04:08.491
Do not get away from me.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.326
Ofelia:
Vémonos.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.749
Okay.
Conmigo, juntos.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.130
Okay, everybody together.
Juntas, huh?

05:57.774 --> 05:59.014
Shoe.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.862
Dad was always the shoe.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.236
Madison:
Daddy wouldn't mind.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.281
So, what do you want to be,
the thimble?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.531
No.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.240
- I'm the car.
- Chris: The car.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.871
All right.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.577
Thank you.
All right, who wants to go first?

Youngest to oldest.

with you guys. I can feel it.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.254

We can go to sleep soon.

09:36.034 --> 09:39.276
Yeah, I can't sleep when I'm waiting
for someone to come home.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.375

You are not able to leave.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.602

Despite the fact that the citywide
curfew is now in effect,

11:23.808 --> 11:25.890
we are still getting reports...

11:40.950 --> 11:44.408
- Liza: Talk to her.
-( Daniel talking in Spanish )

11:44.579 --> 11:47.912

- Another hospital.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.949
No, they will all be like that.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.287
( groans )

11:52.462 --> 11:53.918
Is there somewhere
I can drop you?

11:54.088 --> 11:55.919

- Like I helped you?

11:56.090 --> 11:58.672

12:00.094 --> 12:01.174
Is there somewhere

You will take us with you.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.970
- To my house.
- Yes.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.802
I'll call my cousin
to come and get us,

12:06.976 --> 12:08.762
and then we will be even.

12:08.937 --> 12:10.143
You can stop keeping score.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.395
l was not the one to start.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.638
Dad.

13:00.947 --> 13:04.314
So, what do we do
if he doesn't come back?

13:04.492 --> 13:07.825
It's been, like, six hours.
How bad can traffic be?

13:07.996 --> 13:09.202
Well, he--

13:10.623 --> 13:12.329
Alicia, will you go put
the game away?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.456
- Mom, I don't really wanna--
- You know the rules.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.663
Loser puts the game away.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.589
All right, I'm going.

13:23.553 --> 13:26.215
Nick: Mom, you know
what's out there.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.504
We can't stay here.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.719

13:33.604 --> 13:35.640
Yeah, his family.
I'm just saying--

13:40.445 --> 13:42.310
Maybe he went home.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.025
You know that thing you were saying
about not being an asshole?

13:45.199 --> 13:46.575
- Hey, I'm sorry. ljust don't--
- ( door rattling )

13:46.743 --> 13:48.529
Alicia:
lt's happening again.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.287
(banging)

13:56.044 --> 13:58.126
- Is it Mr. Dawson?
-Shh, shh, shh.

13:59.922 --> 14:02.129
I don't see anything.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.418
Okay, we need to get away
from the windows.

14:09.640 --> 14:10.891
( softly ) You need to tell Alicia
what's out there.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.971
No, she hasn't seen anything yet.
She might not have to.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.261
Alicia, come on down here.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.562
(scraping )

14:25.656 --> 14:28.068
( door opens)

14:32.455 --> 14:34.616

- Shh.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.413
( rattling )

14:40.588 --> 14:42.203
- Alicia: Don't open it!
- Don't open it!

14:42.382 --> 14:43.997
It's just the dog,
it's just the dog.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.915
Hey, hey.
Hey, it's okay.

14:46.094 --> 14:49.586
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.220
Hey, hey, hey.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.100
- Madison: What is that?
- Alicia: ls-- is he hurt?

14:55.269 --> 14:56.930
Nick: I don't think
that's his blood.

14:57.105 --> 15:00.347
(whimpers, barking )

15:02.402 --> 15:04.393
( barking )

15:07.281 --> 15:08.896
( barking continues)

15:14.372 --> 15:15.612
Okay, the Trans have a gun.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.246
A shotgun.
I tried to steal it once.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.203
Alicia, stay close.
Don't stop.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.039
( barking continues)

15:23.923 --> 15:25.288
Here, Mom.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.252
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.132
Okay.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.801
Okay.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.268
Nick:
Okay. Follow me.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.181
(objects clinking )

15:59.333 --> 16:00.493
Nick.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.959
Madison:
Susan? Patrick?

16:06.007 --> 16:08.498
- Nick: Okay, they're not here.
- Madison: Okay.

16:14.849 --> 16:16.259
Susan?

16:21.898 --> 16:24.014
(squeaking )

17:02.980 --> 17:04.891
- I got it, I got it.
- Oh, Jesus.

17:05.066 --> 17:07.853
Um, okay, we need shells.
Try up there.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.237
Okay. Whoa, careful.
Give it to me.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.621
Okay.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.413
- Okay, is there any more?
- I don't know.

17:26.587 --> 17:29.454
(dog barking )

17:42.019 --> 17:44.931
Mom? Mom?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.563
Mom, someone's inside
our house.

17:51.737 --> 17:52.943
What?

17:53.114 --> 17:54.775
Here, Mom. Here.
Mom, Mom, load it.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.190
Loadinloadit
Loadit

17:57.368 --> 17:59.529
Watch out.
Stand back.

17:59.704 --> 18:00.944
Careful.

18:02.331 --> 18:03.992
( dog whimpers, growls)

18:04.166 --> 18:07.408
(barking, growling)

18:16.387 --> 18:18.343
( barks )

18:18.514 --> 18:21.677
- Mom--
- Shh, okay, we just stay here.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.466
We'll just stay here.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.104
No. No, no, no.

18:28.274 --> 18:31.311
- lt's Travis. No.
- ( touch tones beeping )

18:31.485 --> 18:33.567
- Oh, my God.
- It might not be him.

18:33.738 --> 18:35.319
( disconnect tone beeping )

18:36.574 --> 18:37.780
Madison:
Yeah, it's him.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.486
Here, take this, take this.

18:49.337 --> 18:50.952
Madison:
Travis!

18:56.552 --> 18:58.133
Madison?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.640
Maddy?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.766
- ( footsteps approach )
- ( door opens )

19:06.937 --> 19:09.428
- | asked you to wait in the car.
- We're staying with you.

19:09.607 --> 19:10.972
Looks like no one's here, Dad.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.015
The car's still in the driveway.

19:13.194 --> 19:14.400
Gotta be here.

19:14.570 --> 19:16.151
- Nick: Left, left, left, left.
- Madison: Travis!

19:16.322 --> 19:17.858

(munching)

19:21.952 --> 19:24.284
(munching continues)

19:27.875 --> 19:29.581
- Dad.
- Get back.

19:29.752 --> 19:32.118
(snarling, munching)

19:34.006 --> 19:35.462
Travis.

19:46.769 --> 19:48.634
(munching continues)

19:48.813 --> 19:50.895
Liza, get Chris in the car now.

19:52.775 --> 19:53.890
Get out of here.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.605

19:59.907 --> 20:01.772
Pete r?

20:03.411 --> 20:04.901
Hey, you're sick.

- Come on, Peter, it's Travis.

20:06.414 --> 20:07.574

20:07.748 --> 20:08.908

-( Liza shouts)

20:14.130 --> 20:16.371
Travis?
Give me the gun.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.835
The shells, the shells.
Where are the shells?

20:19.009 --> 20:21.261
All right. Leave it, leave it.
Let's go.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.425
- ( snarling )
- Liza: Travis, no!

20:27.351 --> 20:28.761
Chris:

20:57.465 --> 21:00.923
(door squeaking )

21:03.971 --> 21:04.960
(grunting)

21:05.139 --> 21:06.629
- Dad!
- Peter, stop!

21:06.807 --> 21:09.219
- Travis!
- No, put the gun down!

21:11.145 --> 21:12.976
Move.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.285
( Liza screams )

21:31.957 --> 21:33.493
(squeaking )

21:33.667 --> 21:35.203
(thuds)

21:56.190 --> 21:57.555
What did you do?

21:57.733 --> 21:59.724
- ( objects clinking)
-( panting )

22:03.239 --> 22:05.446
(wind chimes tinkling)

22:07.910 --> 22:09.901
- ( snarling )
- ( screaming )

22:15.376 --> 22:18.038
- Alicia: Mom!
- Here.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.328
- ( snarling )
- ( screams )

22:20.506 --> 22:22.542
Alicia!
Alicia, give me your hand!

22:22.716 --> 22:24.502
Get off me!

22:24.677 --> 22:26.008
-Ah!
- Just give me your hand!

22:26.178 --> 22:27.588
Alicia!

22:30.432 --> 22:33.344
Will you just get-- get off me!

22:33.519 --> 22:34.850
- Chris.
- Ah!

22:35.020 --> 22:36.601
- Chris.
- What happened?

22:36.772 --> 22:38.228
l was trying to save you, Alicia!

22:38.399 --> 22:39.605
- Travis: Just calm down.
- You okay? What happened?

22:39.775 --> 22:41.185
- Dad, you calm down!
- Liza: Chris!

22:41.360 --> 22:43.521
( infected snarling )

22:51.078 --> 22:53.319
What's wrong with Su-su?

22:53.497 --> 22:56.204
(growling)

22:56.375 --> 22:58.991
Madison:
Susan? Oh, my God.

22:59.169 --> 23:02.206
- Susan.
- Liza: She's sick.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.622
- Was she bitten?
- I can't tell.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.711
She's not sick.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.253
She's dead.

23:20.107 --> 23:22.894
No, that's-- that's not Matt.

23:24.236 --> 23:26.943
He-- he's not like that.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.235
He's-- he's not like that.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.742
Mom, Matt's not like that.
That's not him!

23:33.913 --> 23:35.574
- That's not Matt!
- I know, I know.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.954
- Why would you say that?
- Madison: I know.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.080
'Cause it's the truth.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.131
( door opens)

23:55.225 --> 23:57.136
Travis:
Hey, let me see.

23:57.311 --> 23:59.677
- Mom can fix it.
- Come on.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.062
You know how many times
I've had my nose broken?

24:03.233 --> 24:05.485
Yeah.
Mom can fix it.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.985
Come on.
Let me help.

24:18.374 --> 24:19.989
Yeah.

24:22.878 --> 24:24.288
Ow.

24:31.261 --> 24:32.671
All right.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.682
Hold on.

24:39.853 --> 24:43.186
- ( electricity buzzes )
- Yep.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.393
I don't think it's broken.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.784
- ( water runs, stops )
- What was wrong with that man, Dad?

24:58.956 --> 25:00.867
That woman?

25:03.794 --> 25:05.705
Uh...

25:06.880 --> 25:08.416
people are getting sick.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.008
Will we?

25:16.140 --> 25:18.381
You're gonna be all right.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.049
We all will be.

25:21.729 --> 25:23.014
Okay?

25:27.067 --> 25:29.353
Come on.
We need to talk to everyone.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.905
- ( moans)
- Liza: Sorry. I know, I know.

25:39.455 --> 25:41.411
How's she doing?

25:41.582 --> 25:43.288
You got anything
I could give her for the pain?

25:43.459 --> 25:45.074
Nothing stronger than aspirin.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.833
Um...

25:47.880 --> 25:50.667
Uh, the phone's in the kitchen
if you need to make that call.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.923
ldid.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.835
My cousin is coming
to pick us up in the morning.

25:57.097 --> 26:00.760
We'll set up your mom
in one of the bedrooms, okay?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.801
- Thank you.
- Madison: Aren't we leaving?

26:03.979 --> 26:06.186
Yeah, yeah, we will.
In the morning.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.812
- No, Travis, we have to go.
-( helicopter blades whirring )

26:07.983 --> 26:09.769
We're packed, we're ready.
We were just waiting for you.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.274
Can we talk about this
in the kitchen?

26:11.445 --> 26:12.480
No.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.270
This thing's getting worse, not better.
It's not safe.

26:15.449 --> 26:16.689
Madison, I think Travis is--

26:16.867 --> 26:18.107
- No, it's not your place--
- Alicia: I don't wanna stay.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.742
- I don't-- I wanna go.
-Lookn

26:20.913 --> 26:22.619
- I wanna go. I don't wanna stay here.
- ( stammers ) Hold on.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.280
Hold on. It is dark.

26:24.458 --> 26:25.868
We don't even know
if the freeway is passable.

26:26.043 --> 26:27.374
You expect us to wait here?

26:27.544 --> 26:28.750
We'd be blind out there.
It's dangerous.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.082
- And this isn't?
- Inside, doors locked.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.793
We ride it out
for the night, okay?

26:33.967 --> 26:35.503
We'll take care of each other.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.463
Trust me, Maddy.

26:37.638 --> 26:38.923
We'll leave in the morning.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.306
If we're staying here,
you have to take care of Peter.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.030
- ( dragging)
- ( Travis grunting )

27:01.912 --> 27:03.823
( grunts, breathing heavily )

27:03.997 --> 27:06.033
Daniel:
You can get gas from the truck.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.368
- For what?
- To burn him.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.208
No.

27:17.177 --> 27:21.090
If you burn him,
the sickness will not spread.

27:23.517 --> 27:25.098
We don't know how it spreads.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.759
(grunting)

27:31.650 --> 27:32.856
I understand.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.359
You knew this man.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.196
Yeah, I did.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.743
He didn't deserve this.

28:06.935 --> 28:08.186
It's true what you said...

28:09.938 --> 28:11.314
they don't die.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.346
They keep coming back.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.662
What?

28:29.833 --> 28:32.415
It's good,
what you're doing,

28:32.586 --> 28:35.043
helping that woman,
Griselda.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.920
I'm not helping her.

28:37.090 --> 28:39.752
Yes, you are, Liza.
Give yourself a break.

28:39.927 --> 28:43.670
I gave myself a break, Travis,
a long time.

28:43.847 --> 28:48.011
Turns out I can do a lot more things
than I thought I could.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.176
I know.
I mean, l-l always knew it.

28:51.605 --> 28:54.688
No... you always said it.

28:57.194 --> 29:00.061
If I had seven years now,
I can go to med school,

29:00.239 --> 29:02.025
be a doctor.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.743
It's too bad,
'cause that's what she needs.

29:07.913 --> 29:11.497
Forget the fractures,
the lacerations.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.785
When the foot was crushed,
the tissue began to die.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.794
And it will die.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.126
Infection will poison her blood.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.837
- Her organs will fail.
- It won't come to that.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.924
Oh, yeah?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.507
Who's gonna stop it, you?

29:29.685 --> 29:30.970
(soft laugh )

29:31.144 --> 29:33.305
Can't fix everything, Travis.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.641
Well, you know what?
I'm relieved.

29:35.816 --> 29:38.683
I thought it was gonna be awkward
having two wives in the house.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.360
( chuckles )

29:47.995 --> 29:50.111
What's happening?
What is this?

29:50.289 --> 29:52.496
Something to survive.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.998
Okay, so we should go with them
tomorrow, then.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.159
No.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.123
( speaks Spanish )

29:59.298 --> 30:00.708
We don't know
what's happening.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.258
We can't handle this
on our own.

30:02.426 --> 30:05.008
- I can handle it.
- Papa, we need help.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.385
- They can help us.
- ( tsks )

30:07.556 --> 30:09.342
Papa?

30:11.393 --> 30:15.557
This is the wrong time
to be in someone else's debt.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.143
They are not family.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.399
(soft laugh )
Family.

30:20.569 --> 30:22.025
Like your cousin?

30:22.195 --> 30:23.275
Oye.

30:23.447 --> 30:24.857
(speaking Spanish )

30:53.393 --> 30:55.099
Papa".

31:09.576 --> 31:12.033
( door opens, closes)

31:17.376 --> 31:19.367
- ( snarling echoes)
- ( chimes tinkling)

31:26.259 --> 31:28.170
Hey,angeL

31:28.345 --> 31:30.427
Where'd you get the pills?

31:31.932 --> 31:33.888
I went back to school.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.469
Cops hadn't cleared out
thelocken

31:35.644 --> 31:37.475
Smart girl.

31:38.980 --> 31:41.596
I'm gonna take enough
to get Nick set in the desert,

31:41.775 --> 31:42.935
and then give the rest
to that woman.

31:43.110 --> 31:44.850
Griselda, good.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.277
Hey...

31:48.448 --> 31:50.905
I had to bring them.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.112
Of course.
She was hurt.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.787
No.

31:54.955 --> 31:56.445
They took us in, Maddy.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.448
Sorry about what Daniel did.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.666
He had to.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.179
I thought I lost you.

32:15.350 --> 32:19.639
No, you didn't lose me.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.804
You're never gonna lose me.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.769
I won't leave you again.

32:29.072 --> 32:31.688
( distant siren wailing )

32:45.255 --> 32:47.337
Who can sleep, right?

32:51.011 --> 32:54.720
Look, I don't wanna
cause problems.

32:58.226 --> 33:01.184
Madison, I know
we're not friends.

33:01.354 --> 33:05.097
I'm saying this to you
as a mother.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.142
We should support each other,
you and me.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.527
The kids need it.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.403
They need reassurance
right now, and--

33:12.574 --> 33:14.155
I need something from you.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.072
That woman outside,
that's Susan.

33:20.749 --> 33:22.205
- ( snarling )
- She watched my kids

33:22.375 --> 33:24.036
when I went to work.

33:26.588 --> 33:29.125
Took care of me
after my husband died.

33:33.512 --> 33:36.219
Sounds like a good friend.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.050
She was.

33:40.852 --> 33:44.470
And if ever I end up like her,
I need you to take care of it.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.187
Don't make Travis do it.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.149
It would break him.

34:03.792 --> 34:06.454
(wind chimes tinkling)

34:08.255 --> 34:10.211
(snarling )

34:25.480 --> 34:29.064
(snarling )

34:40.245 --> 34:41.781
Morning, Susan.

34:56.636 --> 34:58.797
(wheels rattling )

35:07.147 --> 35:09.183
Daniel:
These barrels have a cylinder.

35:09.357 --> 35:13.475
Bore choke
for wider spread of the ammo.

35:14.529 --> 35:16.645
This is the brake.

35:18.158 --> 35:19.944
- Okay.
- You load here.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.449
Thank you.

35:23.371 --> 35:26.989
These are #8 birdshot.

35:28.293 --> 35:31.205
These are double-aught buck.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.667
Those would stop something.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.047
Okay.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.512
- Feeling better?
- What the hell are you doing?

35:43.683 --> 35:44.968
He'sjust showing me
the gun, Dad.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.304
- Finish packing the truck.
- It's not a big deal.

35:47.479 --> 35:50.061
Chris. Go.

36:02.535 --> 36:03.615
( door closes)

36:03.787 --> 36:06.028
The more the boy knows,
the safer he'll be.

36:06.206 --> 36:08.197
- Uh-huh.
- I didn't see the harm, Trav.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.491
You know how I feel about guns.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.706
The gun doesn't care
how you feel about it.

36:13.880 --> 36:15.586
That's enough.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.384
We ready to go?

36:18.551 --> 36:20.382
Cars are loaded, yeah.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.764
l have one more thing to do.

36:31.773 --> 36:33.855
(snarling )

36:40.949 --> 36:42.485
Susan.

36:51.668 --> 36:52.999
Maddy.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.869
Maddy.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.509
l was wondering
where her husband is.

37:06.015 --> 37:08.347
Wondering what it'd been like
if you'd come home last night,

37:08.518 --> 37:10.554
found me like this.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.594
When he comes home,
finds her...

37:12.772 --> 37:14.478
I didn't find you like that.

37:14.649 --> 37:16.810
You think
Patrick's dead already?

37:16.985 --> 37:19.101
You think hejust--

37:19.279 --> 37:21.270
he left, never came home?

37:21.448 --> 37:22.779
I don't know.

37:22.949 --> 37:26.157
(Susan snarling )

37:26.327 --> 37:27.908
Madison:
What is she?

37:29.164 --> 37:32.031
Susan.
She's your friend.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.416
It's all the more reason.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.293
- She's dead.
- We don't know that.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.125
- I do.
- We don't know anything yet.

37:39.299 --> 37:43.338
What if even there's the smallest chance
that she can be helped?

37:43.511 --> 37:45.251
It's not your call.

37:50.310 --> 37:54.053
Give it to me before you do something
that can't be undone.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.271
Madison.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.649
(snarling )

38:09.579 --> 38:11.160
( speaks Spanish )

38:42.487 --> 38:44.352
Nick:
I need a couple more.

38:44.531 --> 38:46.522
(sighs)

38:49.202 --> 38:50.863
Mom.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.380
Please.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.184
Is that all we have?

39:19.148 --> 39:21.139
I gave the rest to Griselda.

39:23.653 --> 39:24.984
Why?

39:26.865 --> 39:28.981
She needs it.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.568
Mom, she's a stranger.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.950
- She's in pain.
- So am |.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.791
I know.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.544
I'm gonna help.

39:45.258 --> 39:48.591
I don't need you, Mom.
I need my medicine.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.058
-( praying in Spanish)
-( knock on door)

39:58.229 --> 39:59.765
( door opens)

39:59.939 --> 40:03.773
( both speaking Spanish )

40:06.404 --> 40:08.770
- Ofelia: They're leaving.
- Good.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.775
This is insane, Papa.
We have to go with them.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.283
No.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.661
Tell me what you're afraid of.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.413
Nothing.

40:19.584 --> 40:23.076
You're being stubborn,
paranoid.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.461
You're hurting Mama.

40:25.632 --> 40:28.590
(speaking Spanish )

40:28.760 --> 40:30.375
She needs the nurse.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.670
I know Travis will let us
go with him if we ask.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.137
Once they're gone,
I will go out, get a doctor.

40:38.311 --> 40:40.176
- He will come and treat your mother.
- How?

40:40.355 --> 40:41.970
Where are you gonna
find a doctor?

40:43.691 --> 40:46.478
(speaking Spanish )

40:48.905 --> 40:50.486
Mama...

40:50.657 --> 40:52.443
( speaks Spanish )

40:54.494 --> 40:57.531
Good people
are the first ones to die.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.163
( speaks Spanish )

41:05.088 --> 41:06.794
- Alicia!
-( honks horn)

41:06.965 --> 41:08.705
Come on.
We're going.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.716
( helicopter blades whirring )

41:11.886 --> 41:13.797
Alicia, come on.

41:15.515 --> 41:17.631
- I heard you.
- Let's go, huh?

41:17.809 --> 41:19.015
Had to pee.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.431
(sighs)

41:33.950 --> 41:35.611
(engine starts)

42:23.249 --> 42:25.160
( helicopter blades whirring )

42:34.302 --> 42:35.758
Madison:
Patrick!

42:35.928 --> 42:38.055
Patrick, wait.

42:38.222 --> 42:41.214
No.
No, no, no, no.

42:47.440 --> 42:50.773
Susan, I'm home.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.934
( helicopter blades whirring )

42:54.530 --> 42:56.942
Boy.
The airport's shut down.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.112
I drove all the way
from Salt Lake.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.322
I tried to call you, but...

43:07.543 --> 43:09.955
- Patrick: Susan.
- Patrick! Patrick!

43:11.005 --> 43:12.961
Don't touch her.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.633
(snarling )

43:14.801 --> 43:16.382
( echoes )
That's not your wife.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.962
What happened to you, Susan?

43:19.972 --> 43:21.007
(gunshot)

43:21.182 --> 43:22.968
( clacking )

43:27.480 --> 43:28.845
(sobbing )

43:29.023 --> 43:31.810
- Man: Guys, go on back.
- Man #2: What the fuck?

43:31.984 --> 43:34.441
(soldiers shouting )

43:34.612 --> 43:36.648
( radio chatter)

43:36.823 --> 43:39.815
( Patrick continues sobbing )

43:39.992 --> 43:42.483
Man:
We have a possible infected here.

43:42.662 --> 43:44.653
( continues indistinctly )

43:50.711 --> 43:52.087
( radio chatter)

43:52.255 --> 43:54.166
( chatter)

43:56.634 --> 43:59.967
- Woman: What's your name, sir?
- Travis Manawa.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.550
- This is your residence?
- Yes, my girlfriend's house.

44:02.723 --> 44:06.466
- And what's your name, ma'am?
- Madison Clark.

44:06.644 --> 44:10.978
- How many occupants?
- Um, nine-- nine altogether.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.434
Big family.

44:12.608 --> 44:14.223
Names, please?

44:14.402 --> 44:17.189
I got Travis Manawa
and Madison Clark.

44:18.197 --> 44:20.529
Uh, Nicholas Clark,
Alicia Clark,

44:20.700 --> 44:23.692

44:23.870 --> 44:25.030
Um...

44:27.248 --> 44:31.833
Daniel Salazar, Griselda Salazar,
Ofelia Salazar.

44:32.003 --> 44:35.120
Female soldier: Okay, make sure that
everyone in your family stays inside.

44:40.970 --> 44:43.586
Can you tell me where you took
my neighbor, Patrick Tran?

44:43.764 --> 44:47.131
Your neighbor was covered
in the infected's blood.

44:47.310 --> 44:48.891
It was his wife's blood.

44:49.061 --> 44:50.392
That wasn't his wife anymore.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.349
Is it contagious, the blood?
Is that how it happens?

44:57.528 --> 44:58.984
Have you or anyone
in this house been exposed?

44:59.155 --> 45:00.486
No.

45:04.202 --> 45:05.738
What's that?

45:08.915 --> 45:10.746
Our dog died.

45:11.876 --> 45:13.161
Sorry to hear that.

45:14.754 --> 45:16.870
( radio chatter)

45:19.467 --> 45:22.925
Soldier #2:
Folks, get back inside.

45:23.095 --> 45:25.006
We will come to you.

45:28.017 --> 45:30.975
- ( soldiers chattering )
- ( engine humming)

45:43.532 --> 45:46.524
( radio chatter continues )

45:49.163 --> 45:52.280

(jet engine roaring )

46:26.993 --> 46:29.575
- ( distant siren wailing )
-( radio chatter)

46:39.338 --> 46:41.545
(soldier shouts indistinctly )

46:43.384 --> 46:44.874
( radio chatter)

46:45.052 --> 46:47.964
- ( soldiers shouting )
- Travis: The cavalry's arrived.

46:50.391 --> 46:52.222
It's gonna get better now.

47:05.197 --> 47:06.812
Up. 90-

47:07.992 --> 47:09.402
One second.

47:25.259 --> 47:26.624
aQué pasa?

47:30.473 --> 47:32.213
(spray can hissing )

47:43.110 --> 47:44.941
( speaks Spanish )

47:51.369 --> 47:54.782
(music playing )
