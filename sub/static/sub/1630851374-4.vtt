Wait. Wait, wait.Just...

32:42.569 --> 32:45.920
I said, get your clothes on.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.706
[beeping, clicks]

32:51.143 --> 32:53.232
Where the hell's my money?

32:53.275 --> 32:54.711
It's not there?

32:54.755 --> 32:57.323
Where'd it go?Where the hell's my money?!

32:57.366 --> 32:59.760
I don't know.
Calm down.

32:59.803 --> 33:01.022
I don't know, and I...I said,

33:01.066 --> 33:03.242
where the hell is my money?![groans]

33:03.285 --> 33:04.591
Who the...? Oh!

33:10.379 --> 33:12.381
He's out.
We got to go.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.166
[panting]:
Oh, my God.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.996
Come on. Come on.Pretzel! Pretzel.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.259
[door opens]

33:21.129 --> 33:24.785
[panting]Okay.Let's... Let's go.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.576
Oh!Here you go. Steps.

33:33.620 --> 33:35.056
Here you go.
Steps. Steps.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.840
Oh, my...Okay, you're good,

33:36.884 --> 33:39.974
Okay, okay, okay.
We're good, we're good.

33:42.846 --> 33:44.326
MURPHY:

[panting]

33:53.335 --> 33:55.468
[pained groan]

33:58.688 --> 33:59.385
Okay.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.299
We're good. We're good.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.692
We're good. Go.[car beeps]

34:02.736 --> 34:04.564
Give me the leash.

34:04.607 --> 34:08.350
Get the cash.
Cash, cash, cash.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.873
Get in.

34:09.917 --> 34:12.050
Oh, what's your name, bro?

34:12.093 --> 34:14.095
Good boy. Good boy.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.532
Get back here!
Hey, you!

34:16.576 --> 34:18.578
Get back here!

34:18.621 --> 34:20.493
[Murphy shrieks, screams]Give me back my money!

34:20.536 --> 34:22.234
Open the door!

[sighs]

34:41.731 --> 34:43.081
We're good.

34:43.124 --> 34:45.735
[gasps]
What?

34:45.779 --> 34:47.085
[gasps]

34:47.128 --> 34:50.262
Oh, my God, that was insane.

34:52.873 --> 34:56.137
Thank you for helping me, um...

34:56.181 --> 34:57.660
Yeah. It's nothing.

34:57.704 --> 34:59.532
Yeah. [laughs]

34:59.575 --> 35:01.969
I got you.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.887
I'm gonna call Darnell and
find out where they are.Yeah, call him.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.367
[laughs]

35:08.410 --> 35:10.543
How did I get here, man?[phone buzzing]

35:10.586 --> 35:13.328
I just wanted to start
a guide dog school,

35:13.372 --> 35:17.550
do a little good in the
world, and-and then...

35:17.593 --> 35:18.942
And then...

35:18.986 --> 35:21.597
And then
you trafficked heroin.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.904
Not by choice.
I'm not like...

35:23.947 --> 35:25.514
Like me? 'Cause, you know,

35:25.558 --> 35:27.212
I didn't really
have a choice, either.

35:27.255 --> 35:29.257
No. Oh, my God, no.

35:29.301 --> 35:30.650
That's not what
I was about to say.

35:30.693 --> 35:31.390
What were you gonna say?

35:31.433 --> 35:32.434
I was about to say...

35:32.478 --> 35:34.132
WOMAN:
Hi. Excuse me, sir?

35:34.175 --> 35:36.743
Yeah?I was actually
talking to him.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.267
Your time limit
for the computer is up.

35:39.311 --> 35:41.835
[laughing]:
Well, there's a time limit?

35:41.878 --> 35:43.489
There is.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.534
Fine. Whatever.

35:46.361 --> 35:49.321
No, no, no, I'm...
Um, ma'am, I'm sorry.

35:49.364 --> 35:52.062
Excuse me. Uh, this woman

35:52.106 --> 35:55.414
has been here at her computer
long before my friend came,

35:55.457 --> 35:57.764
so, are you kicking her off,
too, or...?

35:57.807 --> 36:02.595
Sir, I don't know when she
arrived, but I know when he did.

36:02.638 --> 36:03.987
Oh, interesting.

36:04.031 --> 36:05.946
Do you know when I arrived?
Because I came with him,

36:05.989 --> 36:07.817
and you're not kicking me
off the computer, are you?

36:07.861 --> 36:09.254
You're welcome
to leave, too.It's fine.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.777
Let's go.No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.953
No, no. No, no, no.
Hang on. I'm sorry.

36:12.996 --> 36:15.956
Uh, time out, everybody.
Hang on.

36:15.999 --> 36:19.786
Is anyone else a little...
little disturbed by this

36:19.829 --> 36:21.657
blatant display
of discrimination

36:21.701 --> 36:23.181
that is happening
right before your eyes?

36:23.224 --> 36:25.313
Because, frankly,
I find it very disturbing.

36:25.357 --> 36:26.967
Sir, one more outburst,

36:27.010 --> 36:29.230
and I will have
security escort you out.

36:29.274 --> 36:32.929
Oh, I get a warning.
I wonder why!

36:32.973 --> 36:35.149
I'm just doing my job,
and he's over the time limit.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.586
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Let me handle this.Stop. Stop.

36:37.630 --> 36:39.458
Time limit?
We did not get a time limit

36:39.501 --> 36:40.807
when we came in here, okay?

36:40.850 --> 36:42.374
Did you get a time limit?

36:42.417 --> 36:44.463
Hey. Excuse me?Yeah?

36:44.506 --> 36:46.639
I don't know who got a time
limit. Did you get a time limit?

36:46.682 --> 36:49.555
How about you, sir?
Did you receive a time limit?

36:49.598 --> 36:51.644
Didn't think so. Oh.

36:51.687 --> 36:53.776
Look. A list
of library rules.

36:53.820 --> 36:54.951
Perhaps we should review them.

36:54.995 --> 36:57.040
What do you think?
Let's see

36:57.084 --> 37:00.479
if there's anything
about a time limit.

37:00.522 --> 37:04.570
Rule number one--
"Use a whisper voice." Oopsie.

37:04.613 --> 37:06.049
Rule number two--

37:06.093 --> 37:08.617
"Treat books with respect."
Books.WOMAN: Security?

37:08.661 --> 37:10.445
Not human beings,
but books.

37:10.489 --> 37:12.969
Interesting. Oh.That's it.
We're calling the cops.

37:13.013 --> 37:15.755
No, no. I'm so sorry.
We're trying to...

37:17.539 --> 37:18.671
[sighs]

37:24.111 --> 37:26.374
Can you do
me a favor,

37:26.418 --> 37:28.376
and just do exactly
what this cop says?

37:28.420 --> 37:30.465
Yeah, of course.

37:30.509 --> 37:33.251
I'm so sorry about this.

37:33.294 --> 37:35.035
I am gonna
get us out of this.

37:35.078 --> 37:38.081
Don't do anything. Just,

37:38.125 --> 37:39.953
like I said,

37:39.996 --> 37:42.477
do what the cop says, please.

37:44.305 --> 37:47.177
I just got off the phone
with a couple of detectives.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.702
Gordon Howard?

37:49.745 --> 37:51.921
Yes?

37:51.965 --> 37:53.358
Are you aware
that you're wanted

37:53.401 --> 37:55.229
by the Chicago
Police Department?

37:55.273 --> 37:57.927
Uh... I don't think so.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.886
That... No, I don't...

37:59.929 --> 38:02.192
Um, no, that-that's...

38:02.236 --> 38:04.543
That must be
a misundersta-standing.

38:04.586 --> 38:06.588
Hmm.

38:06.632 --> 38:08.111
Oh, my God.What?

38:08.155 --> 38:09.417
Stay here.

38:09.461 --> 38:10.940
What's going on?The cops got them.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.943
Why?I don't know.

38:13.987 --> 38:14.988
Stay here.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.816
Uh, why him?

How much to let them go?

38:35.400 --> 38:38.577
You seriously
offering me a bribe right now?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.666
How's 50K?

38:41.754 --> 38:43.625
How about a hundred?

38:45.148 --> 38:49.588
Huh? 'Cause I mean, I've got it
with me right now. Cash.

Let me see.
Where is it?

38:51.329 --> 38:54.810
Hold on, dude.
Just-just hold on.

39:03.993 --> 39:05.952
Give me the bag.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.476
Why? What are you doing?

39:08.520 --> 39:11.174
I'm gonna get them
out of this mess.

39:11.218 --> 39:12.698
Please.

39:12.741 --> 39:15.570
Don't worry. We'll
have enough for Jess.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.621
Told you.

39:22.664 --> 39:25.798
Got it all right here,
so, I mean...

39:30.063 --> 39:32.152
Let me see the bag.

39:32.195 --> 39:34.589
What?

39:38.114 --> 39:39.725
This is way
more than that.

39:42.336 --> 39:45.426
Yeah, just take
the hundred and let them go.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.695

Where you going?

39:53.739 --> 39:56.481
I didn't say you could
take all of it.[police car door closes]

39:56.524 --> 39:58.831
Dude, what are you doing?
That's my...

39:58.874 --> 40:00.920
Get up.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.822
It wasn't Felix?

40:33.866 --> 40:35.476
No, it was a false alarm.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.348
Just someone else with that name
that matched his description.

40:38.392 --> 40:40.307
Oh! I'm such an idiot!

40:40.350 --> 40:44.529
I knew. I knew. I knew I wasn't
gonna get them that easily.

40:44.572 --> 40:47.183
All right, look, Josh,
relax, man.

40:47.227 --> 40:49.359
We'll... we'll get 'em.

Back at square one.

Too bad.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.021
Well, I'm headed home.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.327
You guys should do the same.

41:00.370 --> 41:02.503
Good night.

41:07.247 --> 41:08.857
Let's call it, man.

41:17.562 --> 41:20.652
You guys, I think we should
just do what I suggested.

41:20.695 --> 41:23.132
We've been sitting
here for two hours.

41:23.176 --> 41:25.874
We can't waste
any more time.

41:25.918 --> 41:28.007
Give me the phone.

41:28.877 --> 41:31.750
Make sure the number
we're calling from is blocked.

41:45.024 --> 41:47.853

Josh, it's me.
I'm ready to cooperate,

41:52.422 --> 41:54.860
but I need something
from you first.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.385
You have to help me get Jess.
