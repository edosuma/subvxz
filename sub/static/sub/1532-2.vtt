00:02.120 --> 00:04.691
My name is Oliver Queen.

00:04.840 --> 00:07.127
After five years in hell...

00:07.280 --> 00:09.328
...I have come home with only one goal:

00:09.480 --> 00:10.766
To save my city.

00:11.480 --> 00:13.528
Now others have joined my crusade.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.081
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

00:16.280 --> 00:19.124
To the rest of Starling City,
lam someone else...

00:19.280 --> 00:22.682
...I am something else.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.205
Previously on Arrow:

00:24.360 --> 00:27.091
My name is Amanda Waller, Mr. Queen.
Welcome to Hong Kong.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.964
Amanda Waller wants you working for her.
She will have her way.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.806
I know a guy who'd be interested
in hiring someone with your expertise.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.201
- There's another bidder for the company.
- Who?

00:41.360 --> 00:42.646
Ray Palmer.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.041
What are you doing here?

00:49.960 --> 00:53.043
No. No. Sara!

00:53.200 --> 00:54.725
Sara!

00:54.880 --> 00:57.565
No. No.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.170
No.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.970
Felicity, all I'm trying to do
is make things easier on you.

01:13.120 --> 01:17.489
By having me completely reconfigure
our phone system?

01:17.960 --> 01:22.682
Do you even know how difficult it is to ping
a clone off a hacked transband multiplex?

01:22.840 --> 01:26.322
No, but only because
you weren't speaking English just now.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.929
Sara.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.841
I didn't know where else to take her.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.289
Oh, my God.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.526
- What happened?
- I couldn't...

01:43.360 --> 01:44.486
I couldn't leave her.

01:48.240 --> 01:52.086
We have to call...
We could take her to the hospital.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.086
Ollie, it's not fair.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.009
We just got her back. It's not fair.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.161
No.

02:16.600 --> 02:17.840
No.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.841
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.485
I'm sorry.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.722
I'm so sorry.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.171
We'll take our position here.

02:40.320 --> 02:42.049
Who's your target?

02:44.440 --> 02:45.726
I don't have a target.

02:46.320 --> 02:48.607
- You do.
- What?

02:48.760 --> 02:52.207
It might have escaped your notice,
but Waller doesn't have a sense of humor.

02:52.400 --> 02:54.880
Oh, really?
Then why did she drag me off of Lian Yu...

02:55.040 --> 02:57.281
...and bring me to Hong Kong
to become her hit man?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.251
To become her operative.

02:59.400 --> 03:03.883
She needs you or she wouldn't be threatening
my family to assure your compliance.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.691
The target will be entering our line
any moment.

03:14.960 --> 03:19.010
The target will walk 10 paces through the
roof garden, then arrive at his hotel suite.

03:19.160 --> 03:21.970
- That's your window.
- I see it.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.131
Now.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.165
Tommy?

03:44.520 --> 03:46.727
You know,
Sara used to have a stuffed animal.

03:46.880 --> 03:52.250
It was this old worn-out shark
that she got from the Starling Aquarium.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.644
Every time something awful would happen
to her, I would always find her...

03:56.800 --> 04:00.282
...holding that stupid little shark
close to her chest.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.371
And now that my sister's dead...

04:05.080 --> 04:07.731
...again, the only thing
that I can think about...

04:07.880 --> 04:13.125
...is finding that dumb stuffed animal
and putting it in her arms.

04:16.120 --> 04:19.408
- I'm sorry.
- You have nothing to apologize for.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.288
Hey, whoever did this, I'm gonna find them.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.204
We're going to.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.649
When I thought
that Sara died on the Gambit...

04:27.800 --> 04:30.531
...the only thing I could do
was scream at the ocean.

04:30.680 --> 04:35.049
I had so much anger and rage I didn't
know what to do with it. But I do now.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.044
And I'm going to help you catch
whoever it is that did this.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.282
You're already helping.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.410
Laurel, you told us where to look.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.520
- I'm just supposed to sit here and wait?
- No.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.082
Now you take care of yourself
and your family.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.644
Your father is gonna need you.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.451
Telling him now, it would kill him.

05:02.080 --> 05:07.291
If we wait until we catch whoever did this,
it'll be easier on him.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.644
Okay.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.765
Where are you going?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.400
I don't know.
I don't know anything anymore.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.961
But I know that a bar is the last place
I should be.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.323
Come on, pick up.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.801
You've reached Thea. Leave a message.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.167
Thea, it's Oliver. Uh...

05:34.880 --> 05:38.851
I know you're still traveling,
but I just... I could really...

05:39.280 --> 05:43.524
I'd really like to hear your voice.
So please call me back.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.487
- What did we get off the cameras?
- The place is a drug haven.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.803
They've all either been disabled
or paint-balled by local dealers.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.041
- Where are you going?
- Where it happened.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.041
Felicity told me.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.001
You Okay?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.926
The killer stood there.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.562
- Loose gravel on the rooftop.
- Oliver.

07:03.720 --> 07:06.929
Sara was here.
Scuff marks back to the edge.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.844
You don't have to do this right now.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.128
- It's the only thing that I can do.
- I get it.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.402
Military training, stay on task.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.002
Your friend gets shot, you keep fighting.
But, Oliver...

07:16.200 --> 07:19.249
- I'm fine.
- Well, I'm here for you just the same.

07:19.400 --> 07:22.529
Sara was my friend too. If you think
you're going after the person...

07:22.680 --> 07:26.321
...who did this solo,
you couldn't possibly be more wrong.

07:34.200 --> 07:35.850
- Yeah.
- Detective Lance called.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.047
He says it's important.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.565
Think he knows about Sara?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.087
- What is it, detective?
- You okay?

07:54.280 --> 07:57.284
You look like someone
peed in your Corn Flakes.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.445
That kind of day, huh?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.651
- What's going on?
- Another archer in town.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.040
Dropping bodies.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.722
- Seen this guy's work before?
- I might have.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.241
You know where S.C.P.D.'s finest
might find him?

08:12.400 --> 08:14.129
- Who's the victim?
- John Burke.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.408
Some corporate financier from Qurac.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.690
Seems like he wandered into the wrong part
of town looking for local entertainment...

08:20.840 --> 08:22.808
...ended up with an arrow in his chest.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.170
H9)'-

08:26.440 --> 08:28.761
Watch your back, all right?
Whoever this guy is...

08:28.920 --> 08:30.570
He's a killer.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.811
Her hands are so small.

09:08.120 --> 09:10.282
I never noticed before.

09:12.400 --> 09:14.528
She was always so strong and brave.

09:16.480 --> 09:21.202
I always envisioned her
as this sort of Amazonian warrior.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.131
Invincible.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.088
Something I could never be.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.486
I was so jealous.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.400
Hi. I know, I was supposed to come in
to work today. I... The... I'm sorry.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.841
There's been a death in the family.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.650
Thank you.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.770
Do you have any idea
what other archer could have done this?

09:50.920 --> 09:52.410
There aren't that many of us.

09:52.560 --> 09:55.928
Maybe 1 O that I know of and most of them
are in the League of Assassins.

09:56.080 --> 09:58.128
- Oliver, you don't think...?
- No.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.165
No.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.243
They don't target their own.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.050
- What'd you find out?
- He hit again.

10:04.200 --> 10:07.443
An abandoned warehouse on the corner
of Third and Lemire. Ninth floor.

10:07.600 --> 10:11.525
The victim was a foreman, Tim Kaufmann.
Security cameras can't get an angle.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.682
- Then who's that?
- Just some low-level dealers.

10:13.880 --> 10:17.168
They set up shop in warehouses.
Doesn't look like an archer.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.448
- He might be a witness.
- Where do you want me?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.962
Will Lyla give you access
to A.R.G.U.S.'s database?

10:22.120 --> 10:24.282
Lyla will give us access to A.R.G.U.S.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.649
I need a list of everyone on their radar.
Assassins who use a bow.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.006
I'm on it.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.410
What?

10:37.200 --> 10:38.725
Thea hasn't called back yet.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.965
- You didn't eliminate the target.
- That's not a target. That's my best friend.

10:51.120 --> 10:53.487
Why am I pointing a gun at my best friend?

10:53.640 --> 10:55.642
- Is this some sort of test?
- Yes.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.491
- One you failed.
- Good. Flunk me.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.849
You think it's a coincidence your friend
showed up in Hong Kong?

11:02.000 --> 11:05.049
- He's here looking for you.
- What?

11:05.200 --> 11:07.680
When you logged into your e-mail,
it set off an alert.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.763
Dead men don't check their e-mail, Oliver.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.764
- So this is my fault?
- Waller needs you.

11:12.920 --> 11:17.005
She can't let you be compromised by a rich kid
flashing your picture all over Hong Kong.

11:17.160 --> 11:21.449
Whether you're the one who pulls the trigger
or not, she wants Tommy Merlyn off the board.

11:34.440 --> 11:38.525
That is a Cobalt encrypted workstation.
You better not be using it to tweet.

11:38.840 --> 11:42.367
I was... I was, um, actuallyjust...

11:42.520 --> 11:44.124
Accessing an FBI database? What...?

11:45.640 --> 11:47.847
Roy, why are you looking for Thea?

11:48.000 --> 11:51.971
- I don't think she is where she says she is.
- Why would she lie?

12:00.480 --> 12:01.641
Oliver needs to see this.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.963
- No. This is my fault. He's gonna kill me.
- What if she's in trouble?

12:05.160 --> 12:07.288
What if she's not?
What if she just needs space?

12:07.440 --> 12:10.250
She's had five months
and thousands of miles of space.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.040
Oliver needs to see this.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.804
You need to show it to him.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.525
You have got to be kidding me.

12:23.560 --> 12:27.326
- Wait. Where are you going?
- There's someone I need to kill.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.922
Did you do it to make a point?
Because I get it. Loud and clear.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.730
You are rich. You are impulsive.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.724
You are the creepiest stalker
that I have ever had to deal with.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.531
Believe me, that is saying a lot.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.001
What are you doing to our old offices?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.441
Hi. I'll be right back.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.887
Like it?
I'm trying to liven up the place a bit.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.129
I'm hosting an event tonight.
A pledge drive of sorts.

12:56.280 --> 12:57.930
Gotta make an impression, right?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.126
- Now, what can I do for you?
- You can stop.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.044
You can stop sending me flowers.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.727
You can stop texting me and calling me
and e-mailing me, because I spam them.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.120
Is spam a verb now?

13:08.280 --> 13:11.124
Because I am never, ever,
ever going to work for you.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.647
Actually, you already do.

13:13.800 --> 13:16.451
Only because you bought the store
that I work at.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.443
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.887
My boss just called
and told me that you did.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.644
Well, he's wrong.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.371
Kind of.

13:24.800 --> 13:28.247
I bought the holding company
which owns all 20,000 Tech Village stores.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.483
But I guess, either way,
yes, I am your boss now.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.449
So you can either work for me here...

13:33.920 --> 13:36.685
...in a big office with a big salary...

13:36.840 --> 13:40.083
...or you can work for me there
in that awful uniform.

13:40.240 --> 13:43.244
Or I can quit.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.281
Which is What I just did.

13:48.720 --> 13:52.327
You know, most girls would be flattered
that I spent $1.2 billion to hire them.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.006
Even if I do have a plan
for rebranding the stores.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.401
In case you hadn't noticed,
I am not most girls.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.921
And I don't need this. Or you.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.651
- Or any of this.
- Felicity, l...

14:02.800 --> 14:05.610
I piss people off on a daily basis.
It's part of business...

14:05.760 --> 14:09.048
...and well, being the smartest guy
in any given room, I own that.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.242
I have enough experience with people...

14:11.400 --> 14:13.607
...to know when they're angry
at something else.

14:13.760 --> 14:16.764
You, right now, are not angry at me.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.766
What's your something else?

14:20.520 --> 14:24.445
- Money won't fix this problem.
- Money won't solve most problems.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.125
Not the ones that matter.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.123
But talking helps.

14:28.520 --> 14:30.249
I know we barely know each other.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.289
I'm gonna leave now.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.966
Listen, whatever happened, I'm sorry.

14:35.440 --> 14:39.126
It helps to remember that it gets better.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.010
Someone was murdered here.
Tell me what you saw.

15:16.160 --> 15:17.241
I saw nothing.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.447
It was a black face mask. Like a...

15:24.600 --> 15:26.682
Like a hockey mask. Please, man.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.928
Diggle, are you at A.R.G.U.S.?
I've got something.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.726
Yeah, I'm here.

15:33.880 --> 15:36.121
I've got a list of archers 20 long, man.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.931
- How many of them wear masks?
- Only one.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.804
Simon Lacroix. Mercenary.

15:42.480 --> 15:43.766
Goes by Komodo.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.611
- Send Felicity everything.
- Yep.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.967
Oliver, I'm opening up the file now.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.641
- Is that him?
- Born in Sainte-Sophie, Quebec.

15:51.840 --> 15:52.887
Raised by a single mom.

15:53.040 --> 15:56.249
Terrible credit score.
And wanted for murder in seven countries.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.209
- I need his location.
- One minute.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.849
Put him on speaker.

16:02.320 --> 16:05.210
Indexing all active burner cell phones
within the city limits.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.243
That's gotta be 10,000 phones.

16:07.440 --> 16:11.809
Yes, but how many are making calls
to dear old morn in Saints-Sophie, Quebec?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.803
I got him. He's on the move.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.850
I found Lacroix.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.368
- I need to see what's happening.
- Okay. Pulling up street camera feed.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.203
Oliver, what's happening?

18:00.640 --> 18:01.801
Come on, Ollie.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.291
- Get up.
- Oliver?

18:03.880 --> 18:06.406
Are you okay? Oliver?

18:15.520 --> 18:16.601
Oliver, you okay?

18:23.160 --> 18:24.400
He got away.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.769
- I had him, Diggle.
- From the way you look, he almost had you.

18:38.920 --> 18:41.890
- Where's Roy?
- He's out canvassing.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.441
- Tell me about the driver.
- His name is Erlich Kelso.

18:44.640 --> 18:47.723
- He just got out of Starling General.
- Where are we with Lacroix?

18:47.880 --> 18:50.724
- Ditched his burner.
- I'm searching for any calls to Quebec.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.531
We used that to track him once.
He's not gonna let it happen again.

18:53.680 --> 18:56.206
We stop searching for Lacroix
and start searching for his target.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.290
- There must be a connection with his victims.
- Already on it.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.645
Well, I mean, what if we just...?
We go to a local morgue...

19:05.800 --> 19:09.521
...and we find a body
that looks like Tommy's?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.205
At the Hong Kong morgue?

19:11.360 --> 19:14.728
You've got a better chance of winning
the lottery and paying Waller off.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.730
I'm not gonna assassinate my best friend.
Do you understand?

19:17.920 --> 19:21.003
There has to be another way.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.004
There is.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.165
But it involves Amanda Waller finding
someone else to execute your friend.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.082
No, not you, Dad.
Look, I'm already in Hong Kong.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.201
No, I didn't tell you I was taking the jet,
because I knew you would freak out like this.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.449
No, I don't know how long, okay?
It doesn't matter.

19:41.600 --> 19:46.401
Listen, if Oliver is still alive,
if he is still here...

19:48.760 --> 19:52.560
Look, why don't you just go back
to banging your Pilates instructor, okay?

19:55.960 --> 19:59.362
I'll just be here searching
for my best friend.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.409
I'm sorry, miss. You can't go in there.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.126
Laurel Lance.
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

20:11.280 --> 20:14.124
Erlich Kelso is a witness
of my ongoing investigation.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.886
- Mr. Kelso is under protective custody.
- Not from me.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.521
If you have a problem with that,
call your captain.

20:20.080 --> 20:22.003
Tell him his daughter says hello.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.804
- Who are you?
- I work in the DA's office.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.201
I already told the police
I don't know anything.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.048
I still have to ask you a few questions.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.607
- Why isn't this working?
- It is.

20:42.800 --> 20:46.441
It's running an NSA algorithm, aggregating
the victims' personal information...

20:46.640 --> 20:49.166
...using every government database
known and unknown.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.606
It's taking too long.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.764
Sara's killer is out there,
which means every minute we waste...

20:53.920 --> 20:58.209
I know. You don't need to tell me
as if I don't already know.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.845
You're right.

21:01.560 --> 21:04.689
And I apologize. I just need
your A game right now, Felicity.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.683
I don't have it.

21:08.280 --> 21:13.366
My friend, our friend, was shot with arrows
and fell off of a rooftop.

21:13.520 --> 21:16.603
Her body is upstairs,
right above us, in a freezer...

21:16.760 --> 21:20.560
...because we don't know what
to do with it, with her.

21:20.720 --> 21:26.045
So I am so sorry, Oliver, if I have
feelings, but maybe if you did too, we...

21:28.480 --> 21:30.448
I'm sorry. That was mean.

21:30.640 --> 21:32.881
But this is Sara we're talking about.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.644
Your Sara.

21:35.960 --> 21:40.249
How can you stand there
being so cold and rational?

21:40.440 --> 21:43.410
Because I don't have the luxury
of falling to pieces.

21:43.880 --> 21:46.247
Everyone's looking to
me to handle things...

21:46.400 --> 21:48.641
...to make the right decisions.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.761
Everyone is looking to me to lead.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.524
If I grieve...

21:56.680 --> 21:58.808
...nobody else gets to.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.524
You're still a human being, Oliver.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.569
You're allowed to have feelings.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.401
I know sometimes that it's easier
to live under that hood.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.164
I'm not.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.486
Earlier today, I was looking at Sara.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.043
I realized something.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.884
One of these days, it's gonna be me.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.644
And this...

22:33.560 --> 22:35.562
This life that I've chosen...

22:37.520 --> 22:39.124
...it only ends one way.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.369
So that's it?

22:41.520 --> 22:47.562
You're just gonna spend your life hiding
down here in this cave, waiting to die?

22:47.760 --> 22:50.127
I'm sorry, I'm not gonna wait with you.

22:50.280 --> 22:55.002
Because if there's one thing that today
has taught me, it is that life is precious.

22:56.280 --> 23:00.080
And I want so much more to mine than this.

23:11.720 --> 23:15.281
Let's start with the obvious.
Why would someone wanna kill you?

23:16.600 --> 23:20.321
I have no idea. This whole thing,
it's insane.

23:20.480 --> 23:26.601
Mr. Kelso, despite what you may have heard,
homicides at the hands of a stranger are rare.

23:27.480 --> 23:31.121
Imagine how rare homicides
by bow and arrow are.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.931
- Yeah, the guy was a sicko.
- And you're a liar.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.447
- I'm the victim here.
- You're also a witness, my witness.

23:38.640 --> 23:42.122
You better give me something useful,
or you'll face an obstruction charge.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.648
I wanna talk to your boss,
because you can't treat people like this.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.245
You wanna talk to my boss?

23:47.440 --> 23:49.044
- Oh!
- How's your arm feeling?

23:49.200 --> 23:50.531
What are you doing?

23:50.680 --> 23:54.082
John Burke and Tim Kaufmann,
they were also shot dead with arrows.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.965
- And they're too dead to tell me why.
- I can't.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.931
- Aah!
- Burke and Kaufmann...

23:59.120 --> 24:01.168
...what do the two of them
have to do with you?

24:01.320 --> 24:05.291
We're all working on a deal,
but nobody was supposed to know about it.

24:08.960 --> 24:12.169
- What kind of deal?
- To build an oil pipeline...

24:13.680 --> 24:15.330
...for AmerTek. it's...

24:36.800 --> 24:39.007
You've reached Thea. Leave a message.

24:39.200 --> 24:43.808
Hey, Thea, it's me again. And...

24:44.120 --> 24:49.411
I don't know if you're getting these messages,
but I'd really like to talk to you, so please...

24:51.000 --> 24:52.126
...just call me back.

24:53.040 --> 24:54.246
Bye.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.249
Lyla has multiple teams
trying to get an angle on Lacroix.

25:01.760 --> 25:02.761
Where's Felicity?

25:03.240 --> 25:04.765
Hmm?

25:05.080 --> 25:06.525
She needed some air.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.927
What do you need, Oliver?

25:09.560 --> 25:11.085
I just need Thea to call me back.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.961
That's not gonna happen.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.806
Why? What do you mean?

25:41.800 --> 25:43.290
It was during the siege.

25:44.280 --> 25:47.648
We were gonna run away, but I couldn't
leave without helping you fight.

25:47.800 --> 25:49.290
When I came back, she was gone.

25:51.680 --> 25:56.447
I didn't say anything, because this is my fault.
She knew I was lying to her the entire time.

25:56.800 --> 26:00.202
I'm sorry I didn't say anything about
the letter. I know that I should have.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.810
Okay.

26:14.600 --> 26:19.083
Felicity, I really need to talk to you, so please,
can you call me back as soon as you get this?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.890
Laurel.

26:21.040 --> 26:24.044
- Baby, are you all right? Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

26:24.200 --> 26:27.647
A guy just got skewered right in front
of you, I hope you're not fine.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.802
What were you doing here
in the first place?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.691
- The district attorney...
- Did not send you.

26:33.640 --> 26:36.769
You lied to my officers,
and now you're gonna stand there...

26:36.920 --> 26:38.649
...and you're gonna lie to me?

26:39.400 --> 26:41.926
- I needed to talk to him. It was important.
- Look.

26:42.560 --> 26:47.009
I know you wanna help, but you don't need to
take these kind of risks, do you understand?

26:47.160 --> 26:49.845
Pretty sure your sister's got that covered
for both of you.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.766
Yeah.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.890
Go home. We got this.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.090
Okay?

27:01.640 --> 27:05.122
I've got something. Meet me at Verdant.

27:05.880 --> 27:08.645
AmerTek Industries,
it's an oil company based in Starling City.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.600
Okay, now that I've consolidated
all of Lacroix's victims' records...

27:12.760 --> 27:15.889
...I can run an algorithm
and see who received money from AmerTek.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.042
- How long does that take?
- Not long.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.931
A million to Kelso, one more to Burke.
Two more to Kaufmann.

27:21.080 --> 27:25.881
All from a subsidiary from AmerTek in Qurac,
the largest untapped oil field on the planet.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.641
- AmerTek was trying to strike an oil deal.
- Someone paid Lacroix to stop it.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.724
- None of this explains Sara.
- Sara told me she worked in Qurac.

27:32.920 --> 27:35.161
And by worked,
I mean she killed people for the league.

27:35.320 --> 27:39.006
- She might've brought her work home?
- Who authorized the payments?

27:41.080 --> 27:43.082
Board member of AmerTek
called Tom Weston.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.402
Lacroix's next target. What's his location?

27:47.120 --> 27:49.771
You will not believe where he's headed.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.961
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm coming with you.

27:56.120 --> 27:59.090
- Absolutely not.
- The only reason you know where to find him...

27:59.280 --> 28:02.841
You were reckless.
And Lacroix almost put an arrow in you.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.766
Let me handle this.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.802
Don't tell me to stay put and think I'll
listen. You know me better than that.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.608
Sara was trained by some of the greatest
killers in history. Lacroix put her down.

28:16.760 --> 28:19.843
- What is he gonna do to you?
- I don't care about anything except getting him.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.287
- And I will.
- You couldn't before.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.761
I won't let him escape again.

28:24.920 --> 28:25.967
I promise.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.289
- Hi.
- Mr. Palmer.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.442
Good evening. Hey.

28:44.760 --> 28:45.886
Good to see you.

28:46.040 --> 28:47.644
Thanks for coming. Thanks.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.043
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Ray Palmer.

28:51.640 --> 28:54.962
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you all for coming out tonight.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.401
Given all that has befallen this city,
it's easy for us to lose hope.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.450
To hide in our castles, be thankful
that our ledgers are in the black.

29:02.600 --> 29:08.960
But we, the city's most affluent businessmen
and women, hold its future in our hands.

29:09.120 --> 29:11.805
Tonight, I'm making a pledge.

29:12.160 --> 29:16.324
I will give away half my net worth
to the benefit of our home.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.925
And this will be my salary for the year.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.288
So tonight, I invite you all to join me
in this investment.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.329
Not just with your money.

29:26.480 --> 29:30.007
But with your ingenuity
and most importantly, your time.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.443
This city is my home, but it's yours too.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.570
So help make Star City our future.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.171
So you're the Arrow.

30:59.720 --> 31:02.451
- I thought you'd be taller.
- It's over.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.604
Lower your bow and live.

31:06.040 --> 31:07.963
We both know that's not gonna happen.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.527
- Who hired you?
- Who is she?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.242
- You don't wanna do this.
- Yes, I do.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.681
Killing him won't bring her back.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.491
I know it won't bring her back. She's dead.

31:28.640 --> 31:33.601
I've stood where you are, where you're so
consumed with rage you can hardly breathe...

31:33.760 --> 31:36.240
...and you think taking revenge
will make it better.

31:36.400 --> 31:40.450
But, Laurel, it won't.
It only makes it worse.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.402
- No, he murdered Sara.
- Who's Sara?

31:44.560 --> 31:46.688
My sister, you son of a bitch.

31:46.880 --> 31:50.646
Two nights ago
you put an arrow in her chest.

31:52.320 --> 31:55.290
Two nights ago I was drunk in Bludhaven.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.968
- You're lying.
- I'm proud of my work.

31:59.760 --> 32:02.491
- I wouldn't deny it.
- Even with a gun in your face?

32:02.640 --> 32:04.961
- Laurel, you need to stop and listen to him.
- No.

32:06.400 --> 32:09.324
- No, he killed my sister.
- Laurel, Sara wouldn't...

32:09.480 --> 32:13.280
Don't you dare tell me
that this isn't what Sara would've wanted!

32:13.440 --> 32:16.489
Don't you tell me to think of her,
because I am thinking of her.

32:16.640 --> 32:17.926
Laurel, if you pull that trig...

32:22.520 --> 32:24.010
You took the bullets out of the gun.

32:25.600 --> 32:26.806
We have to go.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.131
Lacroix's alibi checks out.

32:38.480 --> 32:41.450
Two murders in Bludhaven. Same M.O.

32:41.640 --> 32:43.210
Same night Sara was killed.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.600
I almost killed Lacroix.

32:44.760 --> 32:47.161
The only thing that matters is you didn't.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.803
Laurel, the trail's run cold.

32:51.520 --> 32:54.444
I'm going to find whoever did this.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.523
I Will.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.410
But I don't know when.

33:00.800 --> 33:03.087
Your father deserves to know.

33:15.280 --> 33:19.808
Hey. I got some info here
on the Lacroix fellow.

33:19.960 --> 33:23.885
Yeah, some stuff's come through.
I don't know, yeah, it looks pretty good.

33:24.040 --> 33:28.762
Lacroix. With an X, yeah. I don't know,
the guy's French or something. Why...?

33:29.160 --> 33:32.369
Oh. Hold on, hold on, I
gotta call you back.

33:33.760 --> 33:36.047
Laurel, baby, what's wrong?

33:39.200 --> 33:40.406
Hold on.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.806
What is it?

33:44.000 --> 33:45.604
Just tell me. Tell me. What is it?

33:46.120 --> 33:48.122
It's about last night.

33:48.920 --> 33:50.081
At the hospital...

33:52.120 --> 33:53.531
...I lied to you.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.205
You deserve to know the truth and...

33:59.080 --> 34:00.889
Sorry, sweetheart.

34:01.040 --> 34:04.362
Damn thing goes off every hour
if I don't take my pills.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.967
Laurel, what do you know? You were
in the middle of telling me something.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.201
I just wanted to say that...

34:15.320 --> 34:17.004
That I'm really sorry.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.726
I know that I should've told you the truth.
I just...

34:20.040 --> 34:21.485
I just couldn't.

34:21.639 --> 34:26.328
Hey, I'm your dad. I forgive you.

34:29.159 --> 34:31.322
I always forgive you.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.650
It's all right.

34:40.040 --> 34:43.408
She can rest now. She's home.

35:03.440 --> 35:04.965
It's a Jewish custom.

35:06.760 --> 35:10.207
I know she wasn't, but it feels right.

35:51.080 --> 35:52.570
Laurel.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.885
No, this isn't right.

35:57.120 --> 36:00.920
This isn't...
She doesn't even get a fresh grave?

36:01.520 --> 36:03.761
It's so perverse.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.487
She deserves a proper burial.

36:08.640 --> 36:12.167
- She's earned it.
- No, it's not fair.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.641
No one will ever really know who she was.

36:16.680 --> 36:20.924
Oliver, it's not fair. It's not fair.

36:38.360 --> 36:39.600
Laurel, we'll know.

36:41.240 --> 36:43.925
I know this doesn't count for much...

36:44.080 --> 36:46.686
...but me and Lyla,
we're naming the baby Sara.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.003
We will never forget.

36:51.880 --> 36:53.245
Thank you.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.564
How did I...?

37:15.320 --> 37:17.448
What the hell is going on here?

37:17.600 --> 37:18.681
Where am I?

37:23.480 --> 37:25.801
Please, please don't hurt me.

37:25.960 --> 37:28.122
Look, just let me go, please.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.250
I promise, I won't tell anybody about this.

37:31.400 --> 37:35.166
Would a fisherman
throw his prized catch back in the sea?

37:35.520 --> 37:37.841
What are you talking about?

37:38.000 --> 37:42.289
Look, whoever you are,
you really don't wanna do this.

37:42.440 --> 37:45.444
Do you have any idea who I am?
Who my father is?

37:45.600 --> 37:47.409
You're Thomas Merlyn.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.726
You've been looking for Oliver Queen.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.530
How do you...? How do you know that?

37:52.680 --> 37:55.650
A simple hack
of a missing billionaire's e-mail account.

37:55.800 --> 38:02.285
I knew somebody would come looking for him, but
I thought it would be his mother, his sister.

38:02.440 --> 38:08.402
But you, the son of the CEO
of Merlyn Global, jackpot.

38:10.040 --> 38:13.408
My friend,
you are gonna make me a very rich man.

38:13.600 --> 38:15.409
So Oliver didn't...?

38:18.080 --> 38:19.809
He isn't...?

38:22.160 --> 38:24.049
Oliver Queen is dead.

38:24.200 --> 38:26.407
He's rotting at the bottom of the ocean.

38:29.160 --> 38:30.924
And you will too...

38:31.120 --> 38:34.488
- ...if your father doesn't pay that ransom.
- Hong Kong police.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.564
- I'm in here! Please help! Help!
- Hands up.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.722
- Hong Kong police.
- Please, please, please.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.809
Please, please, please.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.007
Thank you.

38:44.160 --> 38:47.323
- You're going home. You're safe.
- Thank you, thank you.

39:01.600 --> 39:04.080
I'm gonna catch whoever killed her.

39:04.720 --> 39:06.324
I know you are.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.647
And until you do, I'm back on the team.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.082
What about your family?

39:14.240 --> 39:17.449
Sara is family, Oliver. Just like you, man.

39:22.280 --> 39:23.611
So now what?

39:24.280 --> 39:26.601
Now I gotta go get Thea.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.646
It's long past time she came home.

39:37.960 --> 39:39.485
John.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.881
I don't wanna die down here.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.369
So don't, Oliver.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.321
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.291
Changed your mind.

41:08.480 --> 41:11.768
I just decided I want more out of life.

41:44.760 --> 41:45.886
Well done.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.443
Thanks, Dad.
