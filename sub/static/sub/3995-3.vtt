00:01.000 --> 00:04.492
Mr. Magnussen, please state your
full name for the record.

00:04.627 --> 00:08.039
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.959
Mr. Magnussen,

00:09.960 --> 00:13.159
how would you describe your
influence over the Prime Minister?

00:13.160 --> 00:14.719
The British Prime Minister?

00:14.720 --> 00:17.799
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.959
I never had the slightest
influence over any of them.

00:20.960 --> 00:22.440
Why would I?

00:23.600 --> 00:29.519
I notice you've had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.319
Why?

00:31.320 --> 00:33.919
Because I was invited.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.719
Can you recall the subjects
under discussion?

00:36.720 --> 00:40.399
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.879
Do you think it right that
a newspaper proprietor,

00:42.880 --> 00:46.639
a private individual,
and in fact a foreign national,

00:46.640 --> 00:50.160
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

00:52.560 --> 00:55.799
I don't think it's wrong that
a private individual should

00:55.800 --> 00:57.759
accept an invitation.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.159
However, you have my sincere
apologies for being foreign.

01:01.160 --> 01:04.239
That's not what I meant. That is
not in any way...

01:04.239 --> 01:06.359
Mr. Magnussen,
can you recall an occasion

01:06.360 --> 01:09.919
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

01:09.920 --> 01:12.600
Or the Prime Minister's
thinking in any way?

01:13.960 --> 01:15.479
No.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.680
Are you sure?

01:18.000 --> 01:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.240 --> 01:31.160
I have an excellent memory.

02:42.760 --> 02:46.120
Your car is waiting outside...
See you tomorrow.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.719
May I join you?

02:57.720 --> 02:59.759
I don't think it's appropriate.

02:59.760 --> 03:03.599
It isn't. Mr. Magnussen, outside the
inquiry, we can have no contact,

03:03.600 --> 03:05.040
no communication at all.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.359
Please don't do that.

03:08.360 --> 03:13.399
In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Catherine Dr.iscoll.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.799
That was before I knew him.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.359
The letters were lively, loving...

03:17.360 --> 03:19.319
some would say explicit.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.479
And currently in my possession.

03:21.480 --> 03:23.399
Will you please move your hand?

03:23.400 --> 03:28.319
"I long, my darling, to know
the touch of your... body."

03:28.320 --> 03:30.319
I know what was in the letters.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.760
She was 15.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.480
She looked older.

03:36.680 --> 03:41.239
Oh, she looked delicious.
We have photographs too.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.880
The ones she sent him.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.719
Yum-yum.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.679
He was unaware of her age.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.839
He met her only
once before the letters began.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.719
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.439
Those are the facts.

03:54.440 --> 03:57.199
Facts are for history books.
I work in news.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.879
Your hand is sweating.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.639
Always, I'm afraid.
I have a condition.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.960
It's disgusting.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.719
I'm used to it.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.799
The whole world is wet to my touch.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.679
I will call someone,
I will have you removed.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.080
What is that?

04:18.200 --> 04:19.720
Claire de la Lune?

04:20.920 --> 04:22.560
A bit young for you, isn't it?

04:24.480 --> 04:28.119
You want to hit me now?
Could you, still?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.959
Little old lady now.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.720
Perhaps you should
settle for calling someone.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.799
Well, go on.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.199
No?

04:40.200 --> 04:42.359
Because now there are consequences.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.759
I have the letters
and therefore I have you.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.439
This is blackmail.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.999
Of course it isn't blackmail.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.479
This is... ownership.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.520
You do not own me.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.720
Claire de la Lune.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.160
It never tastes like it smells,
does it?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.719
Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.120
Yes, Mr. Magnussen.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.320
Oh, God! Oh!

05:38.480 --> 05:39.919
You all right, ma'am?

05:39.920 --> 05:41.040
Fine, yes.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.840
Magnussen!

05:45.280 --> 05:46.799
No-one stands up to him.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.119
No-one dares, no-one even tries.

05:49.120 --> 05:52.159
There isn't a man or woman
in England capable of stopping

05:52.160 --> 05:53.760
that disgusting creature...

05:56.720 --> 05:57.999
Ma'am?

05:58.000 --> 06:01.480
Turn the car around. We're going
back into town. Turn around.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.920
Where are we going, ma'am?

06:06.040 --> 06:07.080
Baker Street.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.199
'You've seen a lot of injuries,
then? Violent deaths?'

06:49.200 --> 06:51.599
'Enough for a lifetime.'
'Want to see some more?'

06:51.600 --> 06:53.160
'Oh, God, yes.'

06:55.120 --> 06:56.240
'The game is on.'

07:02.200 --> 07:05.000
I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.079
Is that Kate?
Yeah, it's Kate.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.559
Invite her in?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.600
Er, sorry, yes,
do you want to come in, Kate?

07:14.160 --> 07:16.199
Hey!

07:16.200 --> 07:17.520
It's hard.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.239
There you go. It's Isaac.
Oh, your husband? Son. Son, yeah.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.759
He's gone missing again.
Didn't come home last night.

07:26.760 --> 07:27.999
The usual.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.879
He's the Dr.ugs one, yeah?

07:29.880 --> 07:31.999
Er, yeah, nicely put, John.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.959
But is it Sherlock Holmes you want?
Because I've not seen him in ages.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.039
About a month.
Who is Sherlock Holmes?

07:37.040 --> 07:38.759
See, that does happen.

07:38.760 --> 07:43.280
There's a place they all go to,
him and his friends.

07:45.080 --> 07:48.240
They all do whatever they do.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.559
Shoot up, whatever you call it.

07:51.560 --> 07:55.279
Where is he? It's a house, it's a
dump. It's practically falling down.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.399
No, the adDr.ess? Where, exactly?

07:58.400 --> 07:59.799
Seriously? Why not?

07:59.800 --> 08:02.159
She's not going to the police,
someone's got to get him.

08:02.160 --> 08:04.399
Why you? I'm being neighbourly.
Since when?

08:04.400 --> 08:07.039
Ha, since now.
Since this exact minute.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.559
Why are you being so...? What?

08:09.560 --> 08:11.359
I don't know,
what's the matter with you?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.359
There is NOTHING the matter with me.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.159
Imagine I said that without
shouting. I'm trying.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.159
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.760
You can't go, I'm pregnant!

08:29.040 --> 08:30.879
What is that?!

08:30.880 --> 08:33.999
It's a tyre lever. Why? Cos there
were loads of smackheads in there

08:34.000 --> 08:35.999
and one of them
might need help with a tyre.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.519
If there's any trouble,
just go, I'll be fine.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.320
John, John, John, John...

08:41.440 --> 08:43.399
It is a tiny bit sexy.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.880
Yeah, I know.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.360
Hello?

08:52.480 --> 08:54.160
What do you want? Excuse me.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.959
Oh, no, you can't come in here!

08:58.960 --> 09:03.479
I'm looking for a friend.
A very specific... friend.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.999
I'm not just browsing.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.439
You've got to go.
No-one's allowed here.

09:08.440 --> 09:11.279
Isaac Whitney, you seen him?

09:11.280 --> 09:14.119
I'm asking you
if you've seen Isaac Whitney

09:14.120 --> 09:15.559
and now you're showing me a knife.

09:15.560 --> 09:18.959
Is it a clue? Are you doing a mime?

09:18.960 --> 09:21.999
Go. Or I'll cut you.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.520
Oh, not from there. Let me help.

09:27.880 --> 09:31.159
Now, concentrate. Isaac... Whitney?

09:31.160 --> 09:32.640
OK, you asked for it.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.479
Agh! Ohh!

09:38.480 --> 09:41.359
Right. Are you concentrating yet?

09:41.360 --> 09:42.919
You broke my arm!

09:42.920 --> 09:44.239
No, I sprained it.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.919
It feels squishy.
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

09:47.920 --> 09:49.999
Feel that! Yeah, it's a sprain.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.999
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.119
Now where is Isaac Whitney?

09:54.120 --> 09:57.239
I don't know! Maybe upstairs.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.480
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

10:00.840 --> 10:02.959
No, it was really sore.

10:02.960 --> 10:04.479
Mental, you are!

10:04.480 --> 10:07.240
No, just used to a better
class of criminal.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.560
Isaac? Isaac Whitney?

10:23.840 --> 10:24.920
Isaac?

10:28.520 --> 10:31.080
Hello, mate. Sit up for me, sit up.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.759
Dr. Watson? Yep.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.199
Where am I?

10:36.200 --> 10:38.839
Arse-end of the universe with
the scum of the earth. Look at me.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.239
Have you come for me?

10:41.240 --> 10:43.919
Do you think
I know a lot of people here?

10:43.920 --> 10:46.279
Hey, all right?

10:46.280 --> 10:50.680
Oh, hello, John.
Didn't expect to see you here.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.440
Come for me too?

10:57.600 --> 11:01.719
Hello, Isaac. Mrs. Watson,
can I, can I get in, please?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.759
Yes, of course, get in. Where's
John? They're having a fight.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.159
Who is?!

11:06.160 --> 11:08.679
For God sakes, John, I'm on a case!

11:08.680 --> 11:10.119
A month. That's all it took.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.959
One! I'm working.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.479
"Sherlock Holmes in a Dr.ug den."
How's that going to look?!

11:14.480 --> 11:16.399
I'm undercover. No, you're not!

11:16.400 --> 11:18.639
Well, I'm not now!

11:18.640 --> 11:21.040
In, both of you, quickly!

11:26.360 --> 11:29.839
Please, can I come?
I think I've got a broken arm.

11:29.840 --> 11:33.360
No, go away. No, let him. Why?
Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.800
Anyone else? I mean, are we taking
everybody home, are we?

11:39.120 --> 11:40.559
All right, Shezza?

11:40.560 --> 11:42.719
"Shezza"? I WAS undercover!

11:42.720 --> 11:44.239
Seriously, Shezza, though?

11:44.240 --> 11:47.199
We're not going home, we're going to
Bart's. I'm calling Molly. Why?

11:47.200 --> 11:50.400
Because Sherlock Holmes needs
to pee in a jar.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.840
Well? Is he clean?

12:04.960 --> 12:06.120
Clean?

12:15.320 --> 12:18.319
How dare you throw away the
beautiful gifts you were born with!

12:18.320 --> 12:20.439
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

12:20.440 --> 12:21.719
Say you're sorry.

12:21.720 --> 12:25.159
Sorry your engagement's over. Though I'm
fairly grateful for the lack of a ring.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.519
Stop it. Just stop it!

12:28.520 --> 12:30.959
If you were anywhere near this
kind of thing again,

12:30.960 --> 12:33.239
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.199
Please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.199
What kind of case would need
you doing this?

12:37.200 --> 12:40.039
I might as well ask you why you've
started cycling to work?

12:40.040 --> 12:41.999
No, we're not playing this game.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.519
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.719
Not interested. I am. Ow!

12:46.720 --> 12:49.359
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.880
Yeah, somebody hit me. Huh?

12:54.320 --> 12:55.680
Yeah, just some guy.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.760
Yeah, it was probably just
an addict in need of a fix.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.440
Yes, I think in a way it was.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.719
Is it his shirt? I'm sorry?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.640
Well, it's the creases, isn't it?

13:11.440 --> 13:12.959
The two creases down the front.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.439
It's been recently folded,
but it's not new.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.959
You must have Dr.essed in a hurry
this morning.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.280
So all your shirts must be
kept like that.

13:21.720 --> 13:23.559
But why?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.319
Maybe cos you cycle to work
every morning, shower

13:26.320 --> 13:29.759
when you get there and then Dr.ess
in the clothes you brought with you.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.480
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.879
Not bad.

13:35.880 --> 13:37.400
And I further deduce...

13:39.000 --> 13:43.199
you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.919
No, he's always walked like that.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.559
Remind me, what's your name again?

13:46.560 --> 13:49.279
They call me the Wig.
No, they don't.

13:49.280 --> 13:51.279
Well, they... they call me Wiggy.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.400
Nope.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.479
Bill. Bill Wiggins.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.760
Nice observational skills, Billy.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.559
Ah, finally!

14:04.560 --> 14:06.759
Finally what? Good news?

14:06.760 --> 14:09.319
Oh, excellent news, the best.

14:09.320 --> 14:12.279
There's every chance that my Dr.ug
habit might hit the newspapers.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.360
The game is on.
Excuse me... for a second.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.239
You've heard of Charles Augustus
Magnussen, of course?

14:22.240 --> 14:25.639
Yeah. Owns some newspapers.
Ones I don't read.

14:25.640 --> 14:27.919
Hang on, weren't there other people?

14:27.920 --> 14:31.159
Mary's taking the boys home,
I'm taking you, we did discuss it.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.599
People were talking, none of them
were me, I must have filtered.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.999
I noticed. I have to filter out
a lot of witless babble.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.560
I've got Mrs. Hudson
on semi-permanent mute.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.439
What is my brother doing here?

14:45.440 --> 14:47.639
So I'll just pay, then, shall I?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.319
He's straightened the knocker.

14:49.320 --> 14:52.759
He always corrects it, it's OCD,
doesn't even know he's doing it.

14:52.760 --> 14:56.160
Why do you do that? Do what?
Nothing.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.879
Well then, Sherlock,
back on the sauce?

15:01.880 --> 15:03.919
What are you doing here?
I phoned him.

15:03.920 --> 15:07.679
The siren call of old habits.
How very like Uncle Rudy.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.799
Though in many ways,
cross-Dr.essing would have

15:09.811 --> 15:11.719
been a wiser path for you.
You phoned him.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.079
Of course I bloody phoned him.
Of course he bloody did.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.799
Now save me a little time -
where should we be looking?

15:16.800 --> 15:18.640
"We"?
Mr. Holmes?

15:20.280 --> 15:21.800
For God's sake!

15:25.560 --> 15:29.199
Anderson?! Sorry, Sherlock,
it's for your own good.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.959
Oh, that's him, isn't it?
You said he'd be taller.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.559
Some members of your little fan
club. Do be polite.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.199
They're entirely trustworthy
and even willing to search

15:39.200 --> 15:42.359
through the toxic waste dump that
you are pleased to call a flat.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.479
You're a celebrity these days,
Sherlock.

15:44.480 --> 15:46.039
You can't afford a Dr.ug habit.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.759
- I do not have a Dr.ug habit.
- Hey, what happened to my chair?

15:49.760 --> 15:51.999
It was blocking my view to the
kitchen.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.399
Well, it's good to be missed!

15:53.400 --> 15:56.719
You were gone, I saw an opportunity.
No, you saw the kitchen.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.679
What have you found so far?
Clearly, nothing.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.279
There's nothing to find!

16:00.280 --> 16:03.199
Your beDr.oom door is shut.
You haven't been home all night.

16:03.200 --> 16:06.439
So, why would a man who has never
knowingly closed a door without

16:06.440 --> 16:09.759
the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

16:09.760 --> 16:12.919
OK, stop, just stop! Point made.

16:12.920 --> 16:14.399
Jesus, Sherlock!

16:14.400 --> 16:18.039
I shall have to phone our parents,
of course. In Oklahoma.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.759
It won't be the first time that
your substance abuse

16:20.760 --> 16:23.240
has wreaked
havoc with their line dancing.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.519
This is not what you think.
This is for a case.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.639
What case could possibly
justify this?

16:30.640 --> 16:32.559
Magnussen.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.000
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.119
That name you think you may have
just heard, you were mistaken.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.559
If you ever mention hearing that
name in this room,

16:45.560 --> 16:48.239
in this context,
I guarantee you, on behalf

16:48.240 --> 16:51.159
of the British Security Services,
that materials will be found on

16:51.160 --> 16:55.119
your computer hard-Dr.ives, resulting
in your immediate incarceration.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.960
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.160
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

17:04.800 --> 17:08.118
Well, I think we'd both find
that embarrassing.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.719
Magnussen is not your business.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.719
Oh, you mean he's yours? You may
consider him under my protection.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.479
I consider you under his thumb.

17:14.480 --> 17:16.398
If you go against Magnussen,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.638
then you will find yourself
going against me.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.959
OK. I'll let you know if I notice.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.839
Um, what was I going to say?
Oh, yeah.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.440
Bye-bye.

17:29.160 --> 17:31.679
Unwise, brother mine.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.879
Ohh! Ugh!

17:33.880 --> 17:35.040
Brother mine...

17:36.320 --> 17:39.839
don't appal me when I'm high.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.679
Mycroft, don't say another word,
just go.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.039
He could snap you in two
and right now,

17:44.040 --> 17:46.640
I'm slightly worried that he might.

17:48.680 --> 17:50.680
Don't speak, just leave.

17:52.920 --> 17:54.160
Oh.

18:03.200 --> 18:05.279
Er, Magnussen?

18:05.280 --> 18:08.199
What time is it? About eight.

18:08.200 --> 18:10.839
I'll be meeting him in three hours.
I need a bath.

18:10.840 --> 18:13.839
It's for a case, you say? Yep.
What sort of case?

18:13.840 --> 18:16.639
Too big and dangerous for any sane
individual to get involved in.

18:16.640 --> 18:19.399
You trying to put me off? God, no.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.720
Trying to recruit you.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.040
And stay out of my beDr.oom.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.559
Oh, John, hi. How are you?

18:37.560 --> 18:38.679
Janine?

18:38.680 --> 18:41.839
Sorry, not Dr.essed.
Has everybody gone?

18:41.840 --> 18:44.239
I heard shouting.
Yes, they're gone.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.399
God, look at the time. I'll be late.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.519
It sounded like an argument.
Was it Mike? Mike?

18:49.520 --> 18:52.639
Mike, yeah. His brother, Mike.
They're always fighting.

18:52.640 --> 18:53.879
Mycroft.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.439
Do people actually call him that?

18:55.440 --> 18:56.639
Yeah. Huh!

18:56.640 --> 18:58.759
Oh, could you be a love
and put some coffee on?

18:58.760 --> 19:00.199
Sure, right, yeah.

19:00.200 --> 19:03.839
Thanks. Oh, how is Mary?
How's married life?

19:03.840 --> 19:06.359
She's fine. We're both fine. Yeah.

19:06.360 --> 19:09.319
Oh, it's over there now.
Where's Sherl?

19:09.320 --> 19:11.399
(Sherl!)

19:11.400 --> 19:14.279
Er, he's just having a bath.
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.

19:14.280 --> 19:16.240
Oh, like he ever is! Yeah.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.120
Morning. Room for a little one?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.400
Morning.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.559
Ooh!

19:30.560 --> 19:34.519
So, it's just a guess, but you've
probably got some questions?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.879
Yeah, one or two. Pretty much.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.280
Naturally.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.560
You have a girlfriend? Yes, I have.

19:47.760 --> 19:50.199
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.999
It's the only way
I can describe him.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.071
Have you ever been to the
shark tank at the London

19:54.083 --> 19:55.919
Aquarium, John? Stood
up close to the glass?

19:55.920 --> 20:01.360
Those floating, flat faces,
those dead eyes. That's what he is.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.879
I've dealt with murderers,
psychopaths,

20:05.880 --> 20:08.159
terrorists, serial killers.

20:08.160 --> 20:13.000
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.119
Yes, you have?

20:16.120 --> 20:17.479
Sorry, what?

20:17.480 --> 20:20.599
You have a girlfriend? What? Yes,
yes, I'm going out with Janine.

20:20.600 --> 20:23.400
I thought that was fairly obvious.
Yes. Well, yes.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.279
You... You... You are
in a relationship?

20:28.280 --> 20:30.079
Yes, I am.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.919
You and Janine? Hmm.
Yes, me and Janine.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.040
Care to elaborate?

20:35.240 --> 20:38.839
Well, we're in a good place.
It's, um...

20:38.840 --> 20:41.119
very affirming.
You got that from a book.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.519
Everyone got that from a book.

20:43.520 --> 20:47.279
OK, you two bad boys.
Behave yourselves.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.479
You, Sherl, you're going to have to
tell me where you were last night.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.399
Working. Working? Of course.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.559
I'm the only one who really knows
what you're like, remember?

20:56.560 --> 20:58.280
Well, don't you go letting on.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.920
I might just, actually.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.079
I haven't told Mary about this.

21:05.080 --> 21:08.239
I kind of wanted to surprise her.
Yeah, I think you probably will.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.759
But we should have you two
over for dinner, really soon.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.999
Yeah. My place though,
not the scuzz-dump.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.919
Great, yeah.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.599
Dinner, yeah.

21:17.600 --> 21:21.040
I'd better dash. It was
brilliant to see you. You too.

21:23.840 --> 21:27.079
Have a lovely day. Call me later.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.919
I might do. I might call you.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.960
Unless I meet someone prettier.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.760
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

21:47.320 --> 21:49.559
You know Magnussen
as a newspaper owner,

21:49.560 --> 21:51.279
but he is so much more than that.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.839
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.879
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.103
And I'm not exaggerating
when I say that he knows

21:59.115 --> 22:01.439
the critical pressure point
on every person of note

22:01.440 --> 22:04.919
or influence in the whole of the
Western World and probably beyond.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.559
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

22:07.560 --> 22:12.519
And he has created an unassailable
architecture of forbidden knowledge.

22:12.520 --> 22:16.280
Its name... is Appledore.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.599
Dinner? Sorry, what dinner?

22:19.600 --> 22:22.719
Me and Mary coming for dinner with...

22:22.720 --> 22:26.559
wine and... sitting.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.479
Seriously? I have just told you that
the Western World is run

22:29.480 --> 22:32.840
from this house and you want to talk about
dinner? Fine. Talk about the house.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.159
It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous

22:38.160 --> 22:39.879
information anywhere in the world,

22:39.880 --> 22:42.639
the AlexanDr.ian Library
of secrets and scandals

22:42.640 --> 22:44.759
and none of it is on a computer.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.679
He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.479
It's all on hard copy, in vaults,
underneath that house.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.159
And as long as it is,
the personal freedom of anyone

22:52.160 --> 22:54.040
you've ever met is a fantasy.

22:55.960 --> 22:57.959
That was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it?

22:57.960 --> 23:00.919
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.
Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock!

23:00.920 --> 23:02.640
Who is it?

23:07.520 --> 23:10.080
Mr. Holmes said you can go right up.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.760
Oh. Go ahead.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.519
Sir?

23:24.520 --> 23:26.799
Can I have a moment?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.120
He's fine.

23:30.480 --> 23:34.119
Look, I... Right.
I should probably tell you...

23:34.120 --> 23:36.800
OK, I... There.

23:43.160 --> 23:45.399
Doesn't mean I'm not
pleased to see you.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.439
I can vouch for this man.
He is a doctor.

23:47.440 --> 23:50.279
If you know who I am,
then you know who he is.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.960
Don't you, Mr. Magnussen?

23:54.840 --> 23:58.199
I understood we were meeting
at YOUR office.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.600
This is my office.

24:05.920 --> 24:08.080
Well, it is now.

24:11.640 --> 24:15.519
Mr. Magnussen, I have been
asked to intercede with you

24:15.520 --> 24:17.599
by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood

24:17.600 --> 24:20.399
on the matter
of her husband's letters.

24:20.400 --> 24:24.760
Some time ago you put pressure
on her concerning those letters.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.880
She would like those letters back.

24:30.360 --> 24:33.879
Obviously, the letters no longer
have any practical use to you,

24:33.880 --> 24:35.520
so with that in mind...

24:37.880 --> 24:39.079
Something I said?

24:39.080 --> 24:40.960
No, no. I was reading.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.840
There's rather a lot.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.200
Redbeard?

24:52.800 --> 24:56.479
Sorry. Sorry, you were
probably talking.

24:56.480 --> 24:58.159
I...

24:58.160 --> 25:02.039
I was trying to explain that I have
been asked to act on behalf of...

25:02.040 --> 25:05.079
Bathroom?
Along from the kitchen, sir.

25:05.080 --> 25:09.119
OK. I've been asked to negotiate
the return of those letters.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.159
I am aware you do not make copies
of sensitive documents.

25:12.160 --> 25:16.559
Is it like the rest of the flat?
Sir? The bathroom?

25:16.560 --> 25:19.439
Yes, sir. Maybe not then.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.160
Am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

25:25.360 --> 25:29.560
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood...
I like her.

25:31.480 --> 25:34.639
Mr. Magnussen,
am I acceptable to you

25:34.640 --> 25:36.479
as an intermediary?

25:36.480 --> 25:38.080
She's English with a spine.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.120
Best thing about the English...

25:47.840 --> 25:50.399
you're so domesticated.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.560
All standing around, apologising...

25:54.760 --> 25:57.480
keeping your little heads down.

25:59.160 --> 26:03.439
You can do what you like here.
No-one's ever going to stop you.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.960
A nation of herbivores.

26:07.280 --> 26:10.519
I have interests
all over the world but...

26:10.520 --> 26:12.320
everything starts in England.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.720
If it works here...

26:17.240 --> 26:19.240
I try it in a real country.

26:23.520 --> 26:25.879
The United Kingdom,

26:25.880 --> 26:28.360
Petri dish to the Western World.

26:29.440 --> 26:34.319
Tell Lady Elizabeth I might need
those letters so...

26:34.320 --> 26:35.600
I'm keeping them.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.879
Goodbye.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.840
Anyway...

26:44.080 --> 26:46.040
they're funny.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.359
Jesus!

26:53.360 --> 26:56.320
Did you notice the one
extraordinary thing he did?

26:57.600 --> 27:00.359
There was a moment that
kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

27:00.360 --> 27:02.760
Exactly. When he showed us
the letters.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.399
OK. So, he's brought
the letters to London,

27:06.400 --> 27:08.559
so no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.119
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal once
he's established a person's weaknesses,

27:12.120 --> 27:14.799
the pressure point, he calls it.
So, clearly he believes

27:14.800 --> 27:18.719
I'm a Dr.ug addict
and no serious threat.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.808
And of course, because
he's in town tonight, the

27:20.820 --> 27:22.919
letters will be in his
safe in his London office

27:22.920 --> 27:26.119
while he's out to dinner with the Marketing
Group of GB from seven till ten.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.999
How do you know his schedule? Because
I do. I'll see you tonight.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.239
I've got some shopping to do.
What's tonight?

27:31.240 --> 27:32.479
I'll text instructions.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.079
Yeah, I'll text YOU if I'm available.
You are, I checked.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.839
Don't bring a gun.
Why would I bring a gun?

27:38.840 --> 27:41.999
Or a knife or a tyre lever. Probably
best not to do any arm-spraining,

27:42.000 --> 27:45.079
but we'll see how the night goes. Are
you just assuming I'm coming along?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.454
Time you got out of the house, John.
You've put on

27:47.466 --> 27:50.040
7lbs since you married and
the cycling isn't doing it.

27:51.040 --> 27:55.200
It's actually 4lbs. Mary and I
think seven. See you later.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.879
And breaking news now.

28:11.880 --> 28:15.519
John Garvie MP has been arrested
today on charges of corruption.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.520
This follows an investigation...

28:20.720 --> 28:24.959
Magnussen's office is on the top
floor, just below his private flat.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.559
There are 14 layers of security
between us and him,

28:27.560 --> 28:30.199
two of which aren't even
legal in this country.

28:30.200 --> 28:32.307
Want to know how we're
going to break in? Is that

28:32.319 --> 28:34.480
what we're doing? Of course
it's what we're doing.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.559
Magnussen's private lift.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.119
Goes straight to his penthouse
and office. Only he uses it

28:41.120 --> 28:43.319
and only his keycard calls the lift.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.999
If anyone else even tries,
security is automatically informed.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.319
Standard keycard for the building.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.960
Nicked it yesterday. Only gets us
as far as the canteen.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.799
Here we go then. If I was to use
this card on that lift now,

28:56.800 --> 29:00.399
what happens?
Well, the alarMs. would go off

29:00.400 --> 29:02.479
and you'd be Dr.agged away
by security. Exactly.

29:02.480 --> 29:06.119
Get taken to a small room somewhere
and your head kicked in.

29:06.120 --> 29:08.960
Do we really need so much colour?
It passes the time.

29:10.640 --> 29:11.759
But if I do this...

29:11.760 --> 29:14.599
If you press a keycard against
your mobile phone for long enough,

29:14.600 --> 29:17.159
it corrupts the magnetic strip.
The card stops working.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.879
It's a common problem. Never put
your keycard with your phone.

29:19.880 --> 29:22.679
What happens if I use the card now?

29:22.680 --> 29:24.439
It still doesn't work.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.919
But it doesn't read
as the wrong card now.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.879
It registers as corrupted.

29:28.880 --> 29:32.999
But if it's corrupted, how
do they know it's not Magnussen?

29:33.000 --> 29:36.119
Would they risk Dr.agging him off?
Probably not.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.439
So, what do they do?
What do they have to do?

29:38.440 --> 29:40.639
Check if it's him or not.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.720
There's a camera at eye height
to the right of the door.

29:48.240 --> 29:51.119
A live picture of the card user
is relayed directly

29:51.120 --> 29:53.319
to Magnussen's personal staff
in his office,

29:53.320 --> 29:56.079
the only people trusted
to make a positive ID.

29:56.080 --> 30:00.039
At this hour,
almost certainly his PA.

30:00.040 --> 30:02.040
So, how does that help us?

30:03.120 --> 30:04.679
Human error.

30:04.680 --> 30:05.800
I've been shopping.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.279
Here we go then.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.199
You realise you don't exactly
look like Magnussen?

30:14.200 --> 30:16.960
Which in this case is
a considerable advantage.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.919
Sherlock, you complete loon. What are
you doing?! Hang on, was that...?

30:29.920 --> 30:31.479
Hi, Janine.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.599
Go on, let me in.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.879
I can't. You know I can't.
Don't be silly.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.880
Don't make me do it out here.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.279
Not in front of everyone.

30:42.280 --> 30:44.000
Do what in front of everyone?

30:59.640 --> 31:03.039
You see, as long as there's people, there's
always a weak spot. That was Janine.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.039
Yes, of course it was.
She's Magnussen's PA.

31:05.040 --> 31:07.205
That's the whole point. Did
you just get engaged to

31:07.217 --> 31:09.519
break into an office? Yeah.
Stroke of luck meeting her

31:09.520 --> 31:13.039
at your wedding. You can take
some of the credit. Jesus!

31:13.040 --> 31:17.600
Sherlock, she loves you.
Yes. Like I said, human error.

31:19.800 --> 31:23.319
What are you going to do? Well, not
actually marry her, obviously.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.479
There's only so far you can go.
So, what will you tell her?

31:26.480 --> 31:29.639
Well, I'll tell her that our entire
relationship was a ruse

31:29.640 --> 31:32.439
to break into her boss's office.
I imagine she'll want to stop

31:32.440 --> 31:35.160
seeing me at that point,
but you're the expert on women.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.159
So, where did she go?

31:45.160 --> 31:47.839
That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.

31:47.840 --> 31:49.159
Sherlock.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.239
Did she faint?

31:51.240 --> 31:53.079
Do they really do that?!

31:53.080 --> 31:55.119
It's a blow to the head.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.759
She's breathing.

31:56.760 --> 31:57.799
Janine?

31:57.800 --> 32:01.039
Another in here.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.279
Security.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.520
Does he need help?

32:08.560 --> 32:12.119
Ex-con. White supremacist
by the tattoos, so who cares?

32:12.120 --> 32:13.240
Stick with Janine.

32:14.680 --> 32:18.520
Janine, focus on my voice.
Can you hear me?

32:26.800 --> 32:29.159
Hey, they must still be here.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.039
So is Magnussen.
His seat's still warm.

32:31.040 --> 32:33.999
He should be at dinner,
but he's still in the building.

32:34.000 --> 32:36.919
Upstairs. We should call the police.
During our own burglary?

32:36.920 --> 32:39.879
You're really not a natural
at this, are you?

32:39.880 --> 32:41.520
No, wait. Sssh.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.000
Perfume and not Janine's.

32:47.680 --> 32:50.719
Claire de la Lune.
Why do I know it?

32:50.720 --> 32:53.960
Mary wears it. No, not Mary.
Somebody else.

32:56.480 --> 32:58.000
Sherlock!

33:06.720 --> 33:09.199
What would your husband think?

33:09.200 --> 33:12.439
Your lovely husband,
upright and honourable,

33:12.440 --> 33:15.719
so English. What would
he say to you now?

33:15.720 --> 33:17.480
No, no!

33:18.800 --> 33:21.639
You're doing this to protect
him from the truth?

33:21.640 --> 33:24.199
Well, is this the protection
he would want?

33:24.200 --> 33:26.319
Additionally, if you're
going to commit murder,

33:26.320 --> 33:30.120
you might consider changing
your perfume, Lady Smallwood.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.040
Sorry. Who?

33:38.920 --> 33:43.280
That's... not Lady Smallwood,
Mr. Holmes.

33:55.680 --> 33:59.360
Is John with you? He's, um...
Is John here?

34:00.800 --> 34:01.960
He's downstairs.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.239
So, what do you do now?

34:07.240 --> 34:08.958
Kill us both?

34:08.960 --> 34:13.518
Mary, whatever he's got on you,
let me help.

34:13.520 --> 34:16.879
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more
step, I swear I will kill you.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.960
No, Mrs. Watson... you won't.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.399
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.159
I truly am.

34:33.400 --> 34:35.960
Mary?

34:42.639 --> 34:44.958
It's not like it is in the movies.

34:44.960 --> 34:49.199
There's not a great big spurt of
blood and you go flying backwards.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.918
The impact isn't spread
over a wide area.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.759
It's tightly focused so there's
little or no energy transfer.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.679
You stay still
and the bullet pushes through.

34:57.680 --> 35:01.320
You're almost certainly going
to die, so we need to focus.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.920
I said, "Focus!"

35:08.160 --> 35:10.159
It's all well and clever
having a mind palace,

35:10.160 --> 35:12.839
but you've only three seconds
of consciousness left to use it.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.479
So, come on.
What's going to kill you?

35:15.480 --> 35:19.319
Blood loss. Exactly.
So, it's all about one thing now -

35:19.320 --> 35:21.599
forwards or backwards?

35:21.600 --> 35:23.959
We need to decide which way
you're going to fall.

35:23.960 --> 35:27.919
One hole or two? Sorry?
Is the bullet still inside you?

35:27.920 --> 35:30.599
Or is there an exit wound?
It'll depend on the gun.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.799
That one, I think.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.360
Or that one.

35:35.760 --> 35:39.279
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock.
It doesn't matter about the gun.

35:39.280 --> 35:41.039
Don't be stupid.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.399
You always were so stupid.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.559
Such a disappointment.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.159
I'm not stupid.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.639
You're a very stupid little boy.

35:49.640 --> 35:51.839
Mummy and Daddy are very cross

35:51.840 --> 35:55.279
because it doesn't matter
about the gun.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.559
Why not?

35:56.560 --> 35:58.759
You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

35:58.760 --> 36:01.359
What was directly behind you
when you were murdered?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.599
I've not been murdered YET.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.800
Balance of probability,
little brother.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.359
If the bullet had passed through
you, what would you have heard?

36:12.360 --> 36:13.799
The mirror shattering.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.320
You didn't. Therefore...?

36:16.480 --> 36:18.959
The bullet's still inside me.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.999
So we need to take him
down backwards.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.959
I agree. Sherlock,
you need to fall on your back.

36:23.960 --> 36:26.199
Right now the bullet is
the cork in a bottle.

36:26.200 --> 36:28.759
The bullet itself is blocking
most of the blood flow.

36:28.760 --> 36:32.119
But any pressure or impact on the
entrance wound could dislodge it.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.639
Plus, on your back, gravity's
working for us.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.200
Fall... now.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.960
What the hell is that?!
What's happening?!

36:57.160 --> 37:00.199
You're going into shock. It's the
next thing that's going to kill you.

37:00.200 --> 37:03.159
What do I do? Don't go
into shock, obviously.

37:03.160 --> 37:06.319
Must be something in this ridiculous
memory palace of yours

37:06.320 --> 37:07.760
that can calm you down.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.520
Find it.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.919
The East Wind is coming, Sherlock.

37:14.920 --> 37:16.600
It's coming to get you.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.240
Find it.

37:25.880 --> 37:28.159
Hello, Redbeard. Here, boy.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.759
Come on. Come to me.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.559
It's OK. It's all right.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.599
Come on.
It's me. It's me.

37:34.600 --> 37:35.799
Come on.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.719
Good boy. Clever boy.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.199
Good boy.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.080
Hello, Redbeard. They're putting
me down too now.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.679
It's no fun, is it?

37:45.680 --> 37:47.360
Redbeard.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.399
That was shock. You're going
to feel the pain.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.639
There's a hole ripped through you.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.839
Massive internal bleeding.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.120
You have to control the pain.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.040
Control. Control. Control.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.520
You...

38:16.320 --> 38:18.480
You never felt pain, did you?

38:19.600 --> 38:22.279
Why did you never feel pain?

38:22.280 --> 38:25.000
You always feel it, Sherlock.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.920
But you don't have to fear it!

38:41.480 --> 38:42.560
Pain...

38:44.040 --> 38:45.720
heartbreak...

38:47.040 --> 38:48.480
loss...

38:50.440 --> 38:54.520
death... it's all good.

38:56.680 --> 38:58.079
It's all good.

38:58.080 --> 39:01.039
Sherlock! Sherlock. Can you hear me?

39:01.040 --> 39:02.519
What happened?

39:02.520 --> 39:03.759
He got shot.

39:03.760 --> 39:04.879
Jesus!

39:04.880 --> 39:06.199
Sherlock.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.799
Oh, my!

39:07.800 --> 39:08.999
Who shot him?!

39:09.000 --> 39:11.239
'Emergency. Which service
do you require?'

39:11.240 --> 39:16.439
♪ It's raining ♪ It's pouring

39:16.440 --> 39:21.200
♪ Sherlock is boring

39:22.680 --> 39:27.319
♪ I'm laughing ♪ I'm crying

39:27.320 --> 39:31.119
♪ Sherlock is dying. ♪

39:31.120 --> 39:32.840
Sherlock!

39:33.920 --> 39:36.080
We're losing you. Sherlock!

39:38.160 --> 39:42.080
Come on, Sherlock.
Just die, why can't you?

39:43.200 --> 39:47.000
One little push and off you pop.

39:55.800 --> 39:59.720
You're going to love being dead,
Sherlock. No-one ever bothers you.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.639
Mrs. Hudson will cry...

40:04.640 --> 40:06.959
and Mummy and Daddy will cry...

40:06.960 --> 40:11.199
and the woman will cry and John
will cry buckets and buckets.

40:11.200 --> 40:15.279
It's him that I worry about
the most. That wife!

40:15.280 --> 40:17.519
You're letting him down, Sherlock.

40:17.520 --> 40:20.480
John Watson is definitely in danger.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.359
Oh, you're not getting
better, are you?

40:37.360 --> 40:39.000
Was it something I said, huh?

40:43.560 --> 40:46.200
Sherlock!

41:36.320 --> 41:38.519
Mary. Hey.

41:38.520 --> 41:40.239
He's only bloody woken up.

41:40.240 --> 41:43.599
He's pulled through. Really?
Yeah. Seriously? You...

41:43.600 --> 41:46.359
Mrs. Watson, you're in big trouble.

41:46.360 --> 41:47.759
Really? Why?

41:47.760 --> 41:50.960
His first word when he woke up...
"Mary."

42:10.000 --> 42:11.680
You don't tell him.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.200
Sherlock?

42:17.160 --> 42:18.760
You don't tell John.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.000
Bad girl.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.760
Bad, bad girl.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.200
Look at me...

42:34.440 --> 42:36.720
and tell me you're not
going to tell him.

42:45.160 --> 42:47.040
I'm buying a cottage.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.519
I've made a lot of money
out of you, mister.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.879
Nothing hits the spot
like revenge with profits.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.359
You didn't give those stories
to Magnussen, did you?

42:55.360 --> 42:58.559
God, no. One of his rivals.
He was spitting.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.159
Hmm.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.639
Sherlock Holmes, you are
a back-stabbing, heartless,

43:02.640 --> 43:04.399
manipulative bastard.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.559
And you, as it turns out,
are a grasping, opportunistic,

43:07.560 --> 43:10.039
publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.519
So, we're good then?

43:11.520 --> 43:13.559
Yeah, of course.

43:13.560 --> 43:16.319
Where's the cottage? Sussex Downs.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.239
Nice. It's gorgeous.

43:18.240 --> 43:20.639
There's beehives,
but I'm getting rid of those.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.959
Oh, it hurts, does it?

43:23.960 --> 43:26.039
Probably want to restart
your morphine.

43:26.040 --> 43:27.679
I might have fiddled with the taps.

43:27.680 --> 43:31.199
How much more revenge are you going
to need? Just the occasional top-up.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.359
Dr.eam come true for you, this place.

43:33.360 --> 43:35.559
They actually attach
the Dr.ugs to you.

43:35.560 --> 43:37.199
Not good for working.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.759
You won't be working
for a while, Sherl.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.679
You lied to me.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.999
You lied and lied.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.799
I exploited the fact
of our connection.

43:46.800 --> 43:48.080
When?

43:49.600 --> 43:51.599
Just once would have been nice.

43:51.600 --> 43:53.159
Oh.

43:53.160 --> 43:55.519
I was waiting till we got married.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.640
That was never going to happen.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.400
Got to go.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.559
I'm not supposed
to keep you talking.

44:06.560 --> 44:09.199
And also, I have an interview
with The One Show

44:09.200 --> 44:11.600
and I haven't made it up yet.

44:12.920 --> 44:15.319
Just one thing...

44:15.320 --> 44:17.839
you shouldn't have lied to me.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.319
I know what kind of man you are,

44:20.320 --> 44:23.039
but we could have been friends.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.160
I'll give your love
to John and Mary.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.519
You don't tell him.

44:46.520 --> 44:48.879
You don't tell John.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.240
So...

44:52.080 --> 44:54.240
Mary Watson...

44:57.200 --> 44:58.720
who are you?

45:04.480 --> 45:06.840
Mary Watson.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.639
I don't know how much sense
you'll get out of him.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.839
He's Dr.ugged up,
so he's pretty much babbling.

45:19.840 --> 45:22.039
Oh, they won't let you use
that in here, you know?

45:22.040 --> 45:25.480
No, I'm not going to use the phone.
I just want to take a video.

45:31.480 --> 45:32.800
Oh, Jesus!

45:35.320 --> 45:36.879
So, where would he go?

45:36.880 --> 45:38.559
Oh, Christ knows!

45:38.560 --> 45:41.040
Try finding Sherlock in London.

45:42.960 --> 45:45.359
He's got three known bolt-holes.

45:45.360 --> 45:48.359
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock
and Dagmar Court.

45:48.360 --> 45:49.999
Five known bolt holes.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.279
There's the blind greenhouse
in Kew Gardens

45:52.280 --> 45:54.359
and the leaning tomb
in Hampstead Cemetery.

45:54.360 --> 45:55.839
Just the spare beDr.oom.

45:55.840 --> 45:58.119
Well, my beDr.oom.

45:58.120 --> 45:59.760
We agreed he needs the space.

46:03.040 --> 46:05.519
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.

46:05.520 --> 46:07.159
I think he was probably joking.

46:07.160 --> 46:08.439
No, I don't think so.

46:08.440 --> 46:12.639
Leinster Gardens. It's his number
one bolt hole. Top, top secret.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.879
He only knows about it
cos he stalked him one night.

46:14.880 --> 46:17.759
Followed! Followed, yeah.

46:17.760 --> 46:19.719
He knew who shot him.

46:19.720 --> 46:22.599
The bullet wound was here,
so he was facing whoever it was.

46:22.600 --> 46:26.359
So, why not tell us? Because he's
tracking them down hiMs.elf.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.679
Or protecting them.
Protecting the shooter, why?

46:28.680 --> 46:31.159
Well, protecting someone then.
But why would he care?

46:31.160 --> 46:33.920
He's Sherlock. Who would he
bother protecting?

46:35.280 --> 46:38.199
Call me if you hear anything.
Don't hold out on me, John.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.519
Call me, OK? Yeah. Yeah, right.

46:40.520 --> 46:43.520
Good night then. Bye then.

46:46.040 --> 46:47.719
John, need a cuppa?

46:47.720 --> 46:51.679
Mrs. Hudson, why does Sherlock think
that I'll be moving back in here?

46:51.680 --> 46:54.519
Oh, yes, he's put your chair
back again, hasn't he?

46:54.520 --> 46:57.080
That's nice. It looks much better.

46:59.840 --> 47:02.799
John, what's wrong? Tell me. John?

47:02.800 --> 47:07.119
That's your phone, isn't it?

47:07.120 --> 47:09.559
It's Sherlock, John. Sherlock.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.880
John, you have to answer it!

47:18.120 --> 47:20.239
Spare any change, love? No.
Oh, come on, love.

47:20.240 --> 47:21.920
Don't be like all the rest.

47:25.840 --> 47:29.080
Rule one of looking
for Sherlock Holmes, he finds you.

47:30.160 --> 47:32.399
You're working for Sherlock now?

47:32.400 --> 47:36.080
Keeps me off the streets,
doesn't it? Well... no.

47:40.920 --> 47:43.359
Where are you?
'Can't you see me?'

47:43.360 --> 47:45.319
Well, what am I looking for?

47:45.320 --> 47:49.080
'The lie, the lie of Leinster
Gardens, hidden in plain sight.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.239
'Hardly anyone notices. People live
here for years and never see it.

47:54.240 --> 47:57.599
'But if you are what I think you are,
it will take you less than a minute.

47:57.600 --> 48:01.159
'The houses, Mary.
Look at the houses.'

48:01.160 --> 48:03.239
How did you know I'd come here?

48:03.240 --> 48:07.079
'I knew you'd talk to the people
no-one else would bother with.'

48:07.080 --> 48:09.279
Huh, I thought I was being clever.

48:09.280 --> 48:12.159
'You're always clever,
Mary, I was relying on that.

48:12.160 --> 48:14.599
'I planted the information
for you to find.'

48:14.600 --> 48:16.799
Ohh!

48:16.800 --> 48:17.959
'30 seconds.'

48:17.960 --> 48:19.639
But what am I looking at?

48:19.640 --> 48:24.119
'No door knobs, no letterbox.
Painted windows.

48:24.120 --> 48:27.279
'23 and 24 Leinster Gardens.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.359
'The empty houses.

48:29.360 --> 48:33.359
'They were demolished years ago to
make way for the London Underground,

48:33.360 --> 48:36.239
'a vent for the old steam trains.

48:36.240 --> 48:38.759
'Only the very front
section of the house remains.'

48:38.760 --> 48:41.279
'It's just a facade.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.599
'Remind you of anyone, Mary?

48:43.600 --> 48:45.439
'A facade?

48:45.440 --> 48:49.240
'Sorry, I never could resist
a touch of Dr.ama.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.239
'Do come in. It's a little cramped.'

48:55.240 --> 48:56.839
Do you own this place?

48:56.840 --> 48:59.799
'Hmm, I won it in a card game with
the Clarence House Cannibal.

48:59.800 --> 49:04.960
'Nearly cost me my kidneys, but
fortunately I had a straight flush.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.360
'Quite a gambler, that woman.'

49:13.200 --> 49:14.519
What do you want, Sherlock?

49:14.520 --> 49:19.000
'Mary Morstan was stillborn
in October 1972.

49:20.240 --> 49:24.119
'Her gravestone is in Chiswick
cemetery, where five years ago

49:24.120 --> 49:28.279
'you acquired her name and date of
birth, and thereafter her identity.

49:28.280 --> 49:32.119
'That's why you don't have
friends from before that date.'

49:32.120 --> 49:36.799
Need to work on your half of the
church, Mary. Looking a bit thin.

49:36.800 --> 49:39.359
Oh, orphan's lot.
Friends, that's all I have.

49:39.360 --> 49:42.279
'It's an old enough technique,
known to the kinds of people

49:42.280 --> 49:45.039
'who could recognise
a skip code on sight...'

49:45.040 --> 49:48.599
At first I thought it was just
a Bible thing, spam, but it's not.

49:48.600 --> 49:50.359
It's a skip code.

49:50.360 --> 49:52.919
'..Have extraordinarily
retentive memories.'

49:52.920 --> 49:55.559
How can you not remember which room?
You remember everything!

49:55.560 --> 49:57.999
I have to delete something! 207.

49:58.000 --> 50:00.079
You were very slow.

50:00.080 --> 50:02.800
'How good a shot are you?'

50:04.480 --> 50:07.039
How badly do you want to find out?

50:07.040 --> 50:09.359
'If I die here,
my body would be found in a building

50:09.360 --> 50:12.079
'with your face
projected on the front of it.

50:12.080 --> 50:15.679
'Even Scotland Yard could get
somewhere with that.

50:15.680 --> 50:17.759
'I want to know how good you are.

50:17.760 --> 50:19.279
'Go on, show me.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.320
'The doctor's wife must be
a little bit bored by now.'

50:37.000 --> 50:38.040
May I see?

50:42.880 --> 50:44.159
Huh, it's a dummy.

50:44.160 --> 50:46.200
Well, I suppose that was a fairly
obvious trick.

50:54.800 --> 50:58.959
And yet,
over a distance of six feet,

50:58.960 --> 51:00.920
you failed to make a kill shot.

51:03.640 --> 51:06.560
Enough to hospitalise me,
not enough to kill me.

51:07.840 --> 51:11.960
That wasn't a miss,
that was surgery.

51:16.200 --> 51:18.239
I'll take the case. What case?

51:18.240 --> 51:22.839
Yours. Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

51:22.840 --> 51:26.599
Because John can't ever know that
I lied to him.

51:26.600 --> 51:29.239
It would break him
and I would lose him forever.

51:29.240 --> 51:31.720
And Sherlock, I will never
let that happen.

51:33.200 --> 51:36.279
Please, understand,

51:36.280 --> 51:41.359
there is nothing in this world I
would not do to stop that happening.

51:41.360 --> 51:42.560
Sorry.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.800
Not that obvious a trick.

52:02.040 --> 52:05.440
Now talk and sort it out
and do it quickly.

52:18.560 --> 52:21.119
"Hark! The Herald
Angels Sing"

52:21.120 --> 52:23.999
Oh, dear God, it's only two o'clock.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.199
It's been Christmas Day
for at least a week now.

52:26.200 --> 52:29.759
How can it only be two o'clock?
I'm in agony.

52:29.760 --> 52:31.759
Mikey, is this your laptop?

52:31.760 --> 52:34.639
Upon which depends the security
of the free world, yes,

52:34.640 --> 52:36.399
and you've got potatoes on it!

52:36.400 --> 52:38.919
You shouldn't leave it lying around
if it's so important.

52:38.920 --> 52:41.199
Why are we doing this?
We never do this.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.919
We are here because Sherlock
is home from hospital

52:43.920 --> 52:46.079
and we are all very happy.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.719
Am I happy too? I haven't checked.

52:47.720 --> 52:48.959
Behave, Mike!

52:48.960 --> 52:50.639
Mycroft is the name you gave me,

52:50.640 --> 52:54.559
if you could possibly struggle all
the way to the end. Mrs. Holmes.

52:54.560 --> 52:58.959
Oh, thank you, dear. I'm not
absolutely sure why you're here.

52:58.960 --> 53:00.359
I invited him.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.079
I'm his protege, Mrs. Holmes.

53:02.080 --> 53:05.159
When he dies,
I get all his stuff and his job.

53:05.160 --> 53:07.679
No. Oh, well, I help out a bit.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.759
Closer.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.599
If he does get murdered or
something...

53:11.600 --> 53:13.679
Probably stop talking now. OK.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.799
Lovely when you
bring your friends round(!)

53:15.800 --> 53:18.959
Stop it, you.
Somebody's put a bullet in my boy.

53:18.960 --> 53:23.599
If I ever find out who,
I shall turn absolutely monstrous.

53:23.600 --> 53:26.880
This was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.

53:30.920 --> 53:33.919
Ah. Mary. There you are.

53:33.920 --> 53:37.279
Cup of tea. If Father starts
making little humming noises,

53:37.280 --> 53:40.359
just give him a little poke.
That usually does it.

53:40.360 --> 53:42.439
Did you write this?

53:42.440 --> 53:44.559
Oh, that silly old thing,
you mustn't read that.

53:44.560 --> 53:47.719
Mathematics must seem terribly
fatuous now.

53:47.720 --> 53:49.800
No humming, you.

53:52.400 --> 53:55.439
Complete flake, my wife, but happens
to be a genius.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.999
She was a mathematician?

53:57.000 --> 54:02.639
Gave it all up for chilDr.en. I could
never bear to argue with her.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.359
I'm something of a moron myself.

54:05.360 --> 54:09.119
But she's... unbelievably hot.

54:09.120 --> 54:13.120
Oh my God, you're the sane one,
aren't you?

54:14.080 --> 54:15.400
Aren't you?

54:18.840 --> 54:22.040
Oh. Sorry, I just, er...

54:23.920 --> 54:26.399
Oh, you two need a moment?

54:26.400 --> 54:28.279
If you don't mind?

54:28.280 --> 54:32.239
No, course not. I'll go and see if
I can help with...

54:32.240 --> 54:33.720
something or another.

54:42.160 --> 54:45.159
Those two. They all right?

54:45.160 --> 54:48.520
Well, you know,
they've had their ups and downs.

54:52.920 --> 54:54.480
Baker Street, now.

55:05.720 --> 55:09.200
John, Mary...

55:11.800 --> 55:15.119
Oh, Sherlock, oh, good gracious,
you look terrible!

55:15.120 --> 55:17.519
Get me some morphine
from your kitchen, I've run out.

55:17.520 --> 55:21.159
I don't have any morphine. Then what
exactly is the point of you?!

55:21.160 --> 55:22.679
What is going on?

55:22.680 --> 55:23.999
Bloody good question.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.110
The Watsons are about to
have a domestic and fairly

55:26.122 --> 55:27.999
quickly I hope, because
we've got work to do.

55:28.000 --> 55:29.359
No, I have a better question -

55:29.360 --> 55:33.440
is everyone I have ever met
a psychopath?

55:34.560 --> 55:35.959
Yes.

55:35.960 --> 55:38.720
Good that we've settled that.
Now we... SHUT UP!

55:39.960 --> 55:43.679
And stay shut up,
because this is not funny.

55:43.680 --> 55:44.719
Not this time.

55:44.720 --> 55:47.559
I didn't say it was funny. You.

55:47.560 --> 55:50.280
What have I ever done? Hmm?

55:51.520 --> 55:54.079
My whole life, to deserve you?

55:54.080 --> 55:55.639
Everything.

55:55.640 --> 55:58.319
Sherlock, I've told you, shut up.

55:58.320 --> 56:00.359
No, I mean it -
seriously, everything.

56:00.360 --> 56:02.679
Everything you've ever done,
is what you did.

56:02.680 --> 56:05.079
Sherlock, one more word
and you will not need morphine.

56:05.080 --> 56:07.079
You were a doctor who went to war.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.959
You're a man who couldn't stay in
the suburbs for more than a month

56:09.960 --> 56:12.359
without storming a crack den,
beating up a junkie.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.879
Your best friend is a
sociopath, who solves crimes

56:14.880 --> 56:18.519
as an alternative to getting high.
That's me, by the way, hello.

56:18.520 --> 56:20.439
Even the landlady used to
run a Dr.ug cartel.

56:20.440 --> 56:23.439
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.079
And exotic dancing.

56:25.080 --> 56:27.479
Sherlock Holmes,
if you've been YouTubing...

56:27.480 --> 56:31.239
John, you are addicted to
a certain lifestyle.

56:31.240 --> 56:35.559
You are abnormally attracted to
dangerous situations and people,

56:35.560 --> 56:40.439
so is it truly such a surprise
that the woman you fall in love with

56:40.440 --> 56:42.079
conforMs. to that pattern?

56:42.080 --> 56:44.480
But she wasn't supposed to
be like that!

56:48.400 --> 56:50.080
Why is SHE like that?

56:52.680 --> 56:54.600
Because you chose her.

57:00.120 --> 57:02.880
Why is everything always
MY FAULT?!

57:05.040 --> 57:06.959
Oh, neighbours!

57:06.960 --> 57:09.559
John, listen. Be calm and answer me.

57:09.560 --> 57:11.519
What is she?

57:11.520 --> 57:13.759
My lying wife? No, what is she?

57:13.760 --> 57:17.279
And the woman who is carrying my child, who
has lied to me since the day I met her.

57:17.280 --> 57:20.639
No. Not in this flat,
not in this room.

57:20.640 --> 57:24.360
Right here, right now, what is she?

57:27.200 --> 57:28.400
OK.

57:32.080 --> 57:33.720
Your way.

57:35.600 --> 57:36.920
Always your way.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.119
Sit.

57:45.120 --> 57:46.479
Why?

57:46.480 --> 57:48.560
Because that's where they sit.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.639
The people who come in here
with their stories.

57:52.640 --> 57:54.999
They're the clients,
that's all you are now, Mary.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.040
You're a client.

57:57.280 --> 58:00.639
This is where you sit and talk
and this is where we sit and listen.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.600
Then we decide
if we want you or not.

58:33.560 --> 58:35.439
So, are you OK?

58:35.440 --> 58:40.440
Oh, are we doing conversation today?
It really is Christmas(!)

58:44.560 --> 58:46.599
Now?

58:46.600 --> 58:51.000
Seriously, months of silence
and we're going to do this now?

58:58.720 --> 59:01.280
A.G.R.A., what's that?

59:02.200 --> 59:05.440
Er... my initials.

59:08.480 --> 59:11.559
Everything about who
I was is on there.

59:11.560 --> 59:13.919
If you love me,
don't read it in front of me.

59:13.920 --> 59:15.839
Why?

59:15.840 --> 59:19.039
Because you won't love me
when you've finished

59:19.040 --> 59:21.840
and I don't want to see that happen.

59:29.480 --> 59:30.919
How much do you know already?

59:30.920 --> 59:35.239
By your skill set, you are, or were,
an intelligence agent.

59:35.240 --> 59:38.279
Your accent is currently English,
but I suspect you are not.

59:38.280 --> 59:39.839
You're on the run from something.

59:39.840 --> 59:42.079
You've used your skills
to disappear.

59:42.080 --> 59:44.999
Magnussen knows your secret, which
is why you were going to kill him.

59:45.000 --> 59:47.879
And I assume you befriended
Janine in order to get close to him.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.159
Oh, you can talk!

59:50.160 --> 59:53.479
Oh, look at you two,
you should have got married.

59:53.480 --> 59:54.839
The stuff Magnussen has on me,

59:54.840 --> 59:56.639
I would go to prison for the rest of
my life.

59:56.640 --> 59:59.719
So you were going to kill him? People
like Magnussen should be killed,

59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.159
that's why there are people like me.
Perfect!

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.239
So that's what you were, an assassin?
How could I not see that?

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.480
You did see that.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.680
And you married me.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.160
Because he's right.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:17.840
It's what you like.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:27.079
So, Mary, any documents that
Magnussen has

01:00:27.080 --> 01:00:31.360
concerning yourself,
you want extracted and returned.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.399
Why would you help me?

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.679
Because you saved my life.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.999
Sorry-sorry, what?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.280
When I happened on you
and Magnussen...

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.520
you had a problem.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:47.000
More specifically,
you had a witness.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.720
What do you do now?

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.840
Kill both of us?

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.600
'The solution, of course, was
simple. Kill us both and leave.'

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.800
However,
sentiment got the better of you.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.719
'One precisely calculated shot
to incapacitate me,

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:26.839
'in the hope that it would buy you
more time to negotiate my silence.'

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.519
Of course,
you couldn't shoot Magnussen.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.639
On the night both of us
broke into the building,

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.320
your own husband would
become a suspect. So...

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:44.039
'You calculated that Magnussen would
use the fact of your involvement...'

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:48.560
rather than sharing the information
with the police, as is his MO.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:55.679
And then you left the way you came.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.159
Have I missed anything?

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:58.759
How did she save your life?

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.039
She phoned the ambulance.
I phoned the ambulance.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.560
She phoned first.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.919
'Emergency,
which service do you require?'

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.999
You didn't find me
for another five minutes.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.439
Left to you, I would have died.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.599
The average arrival
time for a London ambulance is...

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.719
Did somebody call an ambulance?

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.719
Eight minutes. Did you bring any
morphine? I asked on the phone.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.359
We were told there was a shooting.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.079
There was, last week.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.799
But I believe I'm bleeding
internally,

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.959
my pulse is very erratic, you may need
to restart my heart on the way...

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.599
Jesus, Sherlock. Come on, Sherlock.
Argh!

01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.199
John, John,
Magnussen is all that matters now.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.679
You can trust Mary -
she saved my life.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.279
She shot you.

01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:43.839
Mixed messages, I grant you that...
Argh!

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.999
Sherlock! Sherlock! Take him.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.240
Got him? Yeah.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.400
So, have you read it?

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.279
Would you come here a moment?
No, tell me, have you?

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.360
Just... Come here.

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.360
No, I'm fine.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.840
I've thought long and hard
about what I want to say to you.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.279
These are prepared words, Mary.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:32.920
I've chosen these words with care.
OK.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.440
The probleMs. of your past
are your business.

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.839
The probleMs. of your future...

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.960
are my privilege.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.480
It's all I have to say,
it's all I need to know.

01:03:57.560 --> 01:03:58.960
No, I didn't read it.

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:04.240
You don't even know my name.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.719
Is "Mary Watson" good enough for you?

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.519
Yes. Oh my God, yes.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.360
Then it's good enough for me, too.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.599
All this does not mean that I'm not
still basically pissed off with you.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.999
Hmm, I know, I know.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.999
I am very pissed off,
and it will come out now and then.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.240
I know, I know, I know.

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:30.639
You can mow the sodding
lawn from now on.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.439
I do mow the lawn. I do it loads.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.679
You really don't.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.080
I choose the baby's name.
Not a chance. OK.

01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:41.119
I'm glad you've given up on the
Magnussen business. Are you?

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.719
I'm still curious, though. He's
hardly your usual kind of puzzle.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.199
Why do you hate him?

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.239
Because he attacks people
who are different

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:50.839
and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you?

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.519
He never causes too much damage
to anyone important.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.439
He's far too intelligent for that.

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:59.839
He's a businessman, that's all.
And occasionally useful to us.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.920
A necessary evil,
not a Dr.agon for you to slay.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.479
A Dr.agon-slayer.
Is that what you think of me?

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:10.679
No. It's what you think of yourself.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:12.079
Are you two smoking?!

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:13.440
No. It was Mycroft.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.199
I have, by the way, a job offer
I should like you to decline.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.239
I decline your kind offer.

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.639
I shall pass on your regrets.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.319
What was it? MI6. They want to
place you back into Eastern Europe.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:34.719
An undercover assignment
that would prove fatal to you in,

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.519
I think, about six months.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.039
Then why don't you want me
to take it?

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:44.199
It's tempting, but on balance, you
have more utility closer to home.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.480
Utility! How do I have utility?

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.720
Here be Dr.agons.

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:54.599
This isn't agreeing with me.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.919
I'm going in.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:59.480
You need low tar.
You still smoke like a beginner.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:02.720
Also...

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.280
your loss would break my heart.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.320
What the hell am
I supposed to say to that?!

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.359
Merry Christmas? You hate Christmas.

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:19.119
Yes. Perhaps there was
something in the punch.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.120
Clearly. Go and have some more.

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:28.319
So you realise that Sherlock got us out
here to see his mum and dad for a reason?

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.639
His lovely mum and dad, a fine
example of married life, I get that.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.199
That is the thing with Sherlock,
it's always the unexpected.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.519
Oi. Oi? Mary?

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.599
Jesus Christ! Mary? Sit down.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:43.840
Mary, can you hear me?

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.360
Don't Dr.ink Mary's tea.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.120
Or the punch.

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.720
Sherlock...

01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:00.839
Did you just Dr.ug my pregnant wife?!

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:03.199
Don't worry,
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.559
I calculated your wife's dose
myself. Won't affect the little one.

01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:07.679
I'll keep an eye on her.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.719
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his day job.

01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.000
What the hell have you done?!

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.040
A deal with the devil.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.199
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:28.799
I am in hospital.
This is the canteen.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.119
Is it? In my opinion, yes.
Have a seat.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:33.160
Thank you.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.359
I've been thinking about you.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.519
I've been thinking about you.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:40.960
Really?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.760
I want to see Appledore.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.159
Where you keep all the secrets,
all the files,

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.439
everything you've got on everyone.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.160
I want you to invite me.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.800
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.800
Oh, I think you're a lot more
careless than you let on.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.520
Am I?

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.880
It's the dead-eyed stare
that gives it away.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.720
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.359
You're reading.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:35.960
Portable Appledore.
How does it work?

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:41.920
Built-in flash Dr.ive? 4G wireless?

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:59.158
They're just ordinary spectacles.

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.920
Yes, they are.

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.040
You underestimate me, Mr. Holmes.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:27.920
Impress me, then. Show me Appledore.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:31.519
Everything is available for a price.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.279
Are you making me an offer?

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:34.520
A Christmas present.

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.519
And what are you giving me
for Christmas, Mr. Holmes?

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.880
My brother.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:46.439
Oh, Jesus!

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.999
Sherlock, please tell me you haven't
just gone out of your mind.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.440
I'd rather keep you guessing.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.720
Ah, there's our lift.

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.839
Coming?

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.319
Where?

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.239
You want your wife to be safe?
Of course I do.

01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.639
Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.405
One false move and we'll
have betrayed the

01:10:15.417 --> 01:10:17.399
security of the United
Kingdom and be in prison

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:20.719
for high treason. Magnussen is the most
dangerous man we've ever encountered

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.399
and the odds are
comprehensively stacked against us.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.799
But it's Christmas! I feel the same.

01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:29.039
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.
Did you bring your gun, as I suggested?

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:30.988
Why would I bring my gun
to your parents' house

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.959
for Christmas dinner?!
Is it in your coat? Yes.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:35.480
Off we go, then. Where are we going?
Appledore.

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.520
I would offer you a Dr.ink,
but it's very rare and expensive.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:43.799
Oh, it WAS you.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.559
Yes, of course.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:49.159
Very hard to find a pressure
point on you, Mr. Holmes.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.079
The Dr.ugs thing
I never believed for a moment.

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:56.359
Anyway, you wouldn't care
if it was exposed, would you?

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:59.480
But look how you
care about John Watson.

01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:02.920
Your daMs.el in distress.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:09.239
You put me in a fire, for leverage?!

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.999
Oh, I would never let you burn,
Dr. Watson.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.440
I had people standing by.
I'm not a murderer.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.920
Unlike your wife.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.720
Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr. Watson.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.519
For those who understand
these things,

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:37.479
Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful
man in the country.

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.680
Well, apart from me.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.799
Mycroft's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother, Sherlock.

01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:48.759
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend, John Watson.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.639
John Watson's pressure
point is his wife.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:54.880
I own John Watson's wife,
I own Mycroft.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.760
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:01.880
It's an exchange, not a gift.

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:07.280
Forgive me, but...

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.639
I already seem to have it.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:13.160
It's password protected.

01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.559
In return for the password,
you will give me any material

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:22.679
in your possession pertaining to the
woman I know as Mary Watson.

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:27.719
Oh, she's bad, that one.
So many dead people.

01:13:27.720 --> 01:13:30.359
You should see what I've seen.
I don't need to see it.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:34.120
You might enjoy it, though.
I enjoy it.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:38.239
Then why don't you show us?

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.760
Show you Appledore?
The secret vaults.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.399
Is that what you want?

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:47.720
I want everything you've
got on Mary.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:14:00.119
You know, I honestly expected
something good.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:04.759
Oh, I think you'll find the contents of
that laptop... Include a GPS locator.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:07.679
By now your brother will
have noticed the theft

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:11.559
and the security services will be
converging on this house.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.479
Having arrived, they'll find
top-secret information in my hands

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.119
and they have every justification
to search my vaults.

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:21.719
They will discover further
information of this kind

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:23.639
and I will be imprisoned.

01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:28.199
You would be exonerated and restored
to your smelly little apartment

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:30.960
to solve crimes with
Mr. and Mrs. Psychopath.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:36.520
Mycroft has been looking for this
opportunity for a long time.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:41.360
He'll be a very, very proud
big brother.

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.799
The fact that you know it's going to
happen isn't going to stop it.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:50.600
Then why am I smiling? Ask me.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.480
Why are you smiling?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.479
Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake,

01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.880
which will destroy
the lives of everyone he loves.

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.560
And everything he holds dear.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:13.160
Let me show you
the Appledore vaults.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.240
The entrance to my vaults.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.120
This is where I keep you all.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.039
OK, so where are the vaults, then?

01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:51.120
Vaults? What vaults? There are no
vaults beneath this building.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.560
They're all in here.

01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:01.000
The Appledore vaults
are my mind palace.

01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:04.559
You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:09.639
How to store information so you
never forget it, by picturing it.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:16.360
I just sit here, I close my eyes
and down I go to my vaults.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.040
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.000
My memories.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.280
I'll look at the files
on Mrs. Watson.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:44.840
Hmm.

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:49.279
Oh, this is one of my favourites.

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.480
Oh, it's so exciting.

01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:57.559
All those wet jobs for the CIA.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:03.160
Ooh, she's gone a bit freelance now,
bad girl.

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:14.399
Oh, she's so wicked.

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:16.800
I can really see why you like her.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.879
You see?

01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:28.079
So there are no documents, you don't
actually have anything here?

01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.879
Oh, sometimes
I send out for something,

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:33.599
if I really need it,
but mostly I just remember it all.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.719
I don't understand.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.559
You should have that on a T-shirt.
You just remember it all?

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:42.359
It's all about knowledge,
everything is. Knowing is owning.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:44.519
But if you just know it,
then you don't have proof.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.239
Proof? What would I need proof for?

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.359
I'm in news, you moron.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.439
I don't have to prove it,
I just have to print it.

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.359
Speaking of news...

01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.239
You'll both be heavily
featured tomorrow.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.600
Trying to sell state secrets to me.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.640
Tut tut.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:06.799
Let's go outside.
They'll be here shortly.

01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.600
Can't wait to see you arrested.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.680
Sherlock, do we have a plan?

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.280
Sherlock?

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:30.719
They're taking their time,
aren't they?

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.159
I still don't understand.

01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.319
And there's the back of the T-shirt.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.639
You just know things -
how does that work?

01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.239
I just love your little soldier
face. I'd like to punch it.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:43.599
Bring it over here a minute.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.320
Come on. For Mary.
Bring me your face.

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.680
Lean forward a bit
and stick your face out.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:01.719
Please.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:04.799
Now, can I flick it?

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:09.720
Look at me. Can I flick your face?

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:22.039
I just love doing this.
I could do it all day.

01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:24.319
Well, it works like this, John.

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:26.480
I know who Mary hurt and killed.

01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:30.480
I know where to find
people who hate her.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.960
I know where they live,
I know their phone numbers.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:42.119
All in my mind palace, all of it.

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:47.520
I could phone them right now
and tear your whole life down...

01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.719
and I will,

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:54.120
unless you let me flick your face.

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.200
This is what I do to people.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:06.280
This is what I do to
whole countries.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.040
Just because I know.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.160
Can I do your eye now?

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.240
See if you can keep it open, hmm?

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.399
Come on, for Mary. Keep it open.

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.719
Sherlock?

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:23.720
Let him. I'm sorry, just... let him.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.080
Hmm? Come on, eye open.

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.279
It's difficult, isn't it?

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:38.800
Janine managed to once.
She makes the funniest noises.

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:51.839
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:53.999
Here we go, Mr. Holmes.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:58.239
To clarify, Appledore's vaults only
exist in your mind,

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.399
nowhere else, just there?

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.639
They're not real,
they never have been.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:07.039
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
step away!

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.959
It's fine, they're harmless.

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.639
'Target is not armed,
I repeat target is not armed.'

01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.919
Sherlock, what do we do?

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.999
Nothing. There is
nothing to be done.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:20.839
Oh, I'm not a villain,
I have no evil plan.

01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:25.559
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.
You happen to be one of them.

01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:29.479
Sorry, no chance for you to be
a hero this time, Mr. Holmes.

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:35.039
Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,
stand away from that man. Do it now!

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.160
Oh, do your research.

01:21:38.240 --> 01:21:42.319
I'm not a hero,
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.280
Merry Christmas!

01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:47.439
'Man down, man down.'

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:49.559
Get away from me,
John! Stay well back!

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:51.559
Christ, Sherlock!

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.719
Don't fire! Do not
fire on Sherlock Holmes!

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.720
Do not fire!

01:21:58.360 --> 01:21:59.600
Oh Christ, Sherlock!

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.840
Give my love to Mary.
Tell her she's safe now.

01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.280
Oh, Sherlock.

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.000
What have you done?

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:55.159
As my colleague is
fond of remarking,

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.399
this country sometimes needs
a blunt instrument.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:01.159
Equally,
it sometimes needs a dagger,

01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:05.520
a scalpel wielded with precision
and without remorse.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:12.199
There will always come a time
when we need Sherlock Holmes.

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:16.319
If this is some expression
of familial sentiment...

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.519
Don't be absurd.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:20.560
I am not given to
outbursts of brotherly compassion.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:25.439
You know what
happened to the other one.

01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.159
In any event, there is no prison in
which we could incarcerate Sherlock

01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:32.519
without causing a riot
on a daily basis.

01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:38.239
The alternative, however,
would require your approval.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.159
Hardly merciful, Mr. Holmes.

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.280
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood,
my brother is a murderer.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.759
You will look after him for me,
won't you?

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.880
Hmm. Don't worry.
I'll keep him in trouble.

01:24:04.920 --> 01:24:06.000
That's my girl.

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.319
Since this is likely to be the last
conversation I'll have with John Watson,

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:16.240
would you mind if we took a moment?

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:26.960
So here we are.

01:24:29.080 --> 01:24:30.999
William Sherlock Scott Holmes.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.119
Sorry?

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.640
That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.

01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:38.799
No, we've had a scan,
we're pretty sure it's a girl.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.200
Oh. OK.

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.399
Yeah.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.999
You know, actually, I can't
think of a single thing to say.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.360
No, neither can I.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.399
The game is over.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.279
The game is never over, John.

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.319
But there may be some
new players now.

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:02.880
That's OK, the East Wind takes us
all in the end. What's that?

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.119
It's a story my brother told me
when we were kids.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.639
The East Wind is a terrifying force
that lays waste to all in its path.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.079
It seeks out the unworthy
and plucks them from the earth.

01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.279
That was generally me.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.720
Nice(!)
He's a rubbish big brother.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:25.199
So what about you, then?
Where are you actually going now?

01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:27.799
Oh, some undercover
work in Eastern Europe.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.199
For how long?

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:34.399
Six months, my brother estimates.
He's never wrong.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:35.480
And then what?

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.080
Who knows?

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:52.159
John, there's something I should
say, I've meant to say always

01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:53.599
and I never have.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.520
Since it's unlikely we'll ever meet
again, I might as well say it now.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.480
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.079
It's not.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.279
It was worth a try.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.519
We're not naming our daughter
after you.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:13.040
Oh, I think it could work.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.520
To the very best of times, John.

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.199
'Smith brings it inside.
This looks good.

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.160
'CassanDr.a comes in for a shot.
Ooh, he missed it!'

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:17.622
Oi, there's something
wrong with the telly.

01:27:17.634 --> 01:27:19.760
There's something wrong
with the telly, mate.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:23.279
Who's that?

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:24.839
Did you miss me?

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.079
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.759
How is this possible?

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.599
We don't know, but it's on every
screen in the country.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.079
Every screen simultaneously.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.000
Has the Prime Minister been told?

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.359
And Mycroft?

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.440
But that's not possible. That is
simply not possible.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.600
What's happened?
Sir? It's your brother.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.679
Mycroft?

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:55.119
'Hello, little brother.
How's the exile going?'

01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.599
I've only been gone four minutes.

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.799
Well, I certainly hope you've
learnt your lesson.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:01.639
'As it turns out, you're needed.'

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.760
Oh, for God's sake,
make up your mind!

01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:06.119
Who needs me this time?

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:09.719
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.319
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?
Did you miss me? Did you miss me?'

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.879
England.

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:17.479
But he's dead. I mean, you told me
he was dead, Moriarty?

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:19.359
Absolutely. Blew his own brains out.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.359
So how can he be back?

01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:25.640
Well if he is,
he'd better wrap up warm.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.120
There's an East Wind coming.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.480
Miss me?

01:29:08.305 --> 01:29:14.373
