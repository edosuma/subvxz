WEBVTT

00:41.166 --> 00:43.041
I like that one, Mommy.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.291
(Marlene)
'You're right, Abby.'

00:51.375 --> 00:52.500
It's beautiful.

00:52.583 --> 00:54.583
Kind of looks like
the old house.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.208
Can we just get
out of here, Mom?

00:59.291 --> 01:01.417
(Abby)
'But I think it has
a pool, Natalie.'

01:01.500 --> 01:02.959
I could have a pool party.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.208
For my birthday.

01:04.291 --> 01:06.709
Hello, your birthday
is in November.

01:08.208 --> 01:09.458
Mom.

01:09.542 --> 01:11.333
(Abby)
'Just a regular party then.'

01:11.417 --> 01:13.458
With a vanilla polar bear cake.

01:13.542 --> 01:15.166
Don't hold your breath, Ab.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.375
November's still
two months away.

01:17.458 --> 01:18.291
And?

01:18.375 --> 01:20.709
A lot can
happen
in two months.

01:20.792 --> 01:22.250
We're the Bradford girls.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.166
We celebrate birthdays in style.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.959
This year won't
be any different.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.500
(Abby)
'This our spot, Mommy?'

01:38.583 --> 01:40.959
(Marlene)
'Yeah, for tonight.'

01:59.583 --> 02:03.041
Are we really going to get
a house like the one back
there?

02:03.125 --> 02:04.959
Of course, we are, sweetie.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.000
We can have any house we want.

02:08.917 --> 02:10.500
One day.

03:33.583 --> 03:35.125
Environmental group found it.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.625
Testing the
bottom
of the lake.

03:36.709 --> 03:41.041
- For what?
- That...stuff they test
for.

03:41.125 --> 03:43.291
Looks like this heap
was submerged for years.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.542
Wasn't the only thing submerged.

03:45.625 --> 03:46.709
(John)
'Marlene Bradford.'

03:46.792 --> 03:48.458
'35 years old.'

03:48.542 --> 03:51.166
- How'd you make the ID?
- Car's VIN number.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.834
Running dental records
for verification now.

03:53.917 --> 03:56.208
She was reported missing
eight years ago.

03:56.291 --> 03:59.208
Oh, hot plate.
Hmm, TV, hangers.

03:59.291 --> 04:02.125
- Looks like she was moving.
- Or living in her car.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.333
Area's popular
with the homeless.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.375
Has been for years.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.709
A kid's doll.

04:07.792 --> 04:09.709
'Might have been
a whole family.'

04:09.792 --> 04:11.333
So, what killed her?

04:11.417 --> 04:13.250
Small caliber weapon.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.000
Could be a .38.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.709
That explains Marlene.

04:19.792 --> 04:22.333
So, where's the rest
of the family?

05:03.917 --> 05:05.417
Marlene
Bradford,
mother of two.

05:05.500 --> 05:09.250
Reported missing
November 17, 1999.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.417
Kids the last to see?

05:10.500 --> 05:12.834
Yeah, Natalie,
14, Abby, nine.

05:12.917 --> 05:16.709
Told the cops mom dropped them
off at school. Never came back.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.583
Both girls went into the
system.
We're locating them.

05:19.667 --> 05:23.166
Marlene had a job at Al's
Village Market on Broad
Street.

05:23.250 --> 05:24.834
But she was still living
in her car.

05:24.917 --> 05:28.375
[scoffs]
You try getting by on
six bucks an hour with two
kids.

05:28.458 --> 05:31.667
Bullet's out to ballistics.
Maybe we get a hit.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.083
Car doesn't take a dive
without making a splash.

05:34.166 --> 05:36.375
Thinking some bum
in the park saw something?

05:36.458 --> 05:38.542
Um, shelf life's short
on the street.

05:38.625 --> 05:39.792
'Transients disappear.'

05:39.875 --> 05:42.500
I'll do a canvas.
Maybe we get lucky.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.917
Will...word in my office?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.458
Sure thing.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.750
- 'You went behind my back.'
- Excuse me?

06:00.834 --> 06:02.250
I know you got the name
of the ex-trucker

06:02.333 --> 06:03.458
Jersey's looking into.

06:03.542 --> 06:04.625
It's a free country.

06:04.709 --> 06:05.750
You need to back off, Will.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.417
He took my wife.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.750
You got no business
telling me what to do.

06:09.834 --> 06:11.750
This guy's got it coming,
no denying it

06:11.834 --> 06:13.917
but you do this, you're lost.

06:20.041 --> 06:21.542
You know where Mary was going..

06:21.625 --> 06:22.959
...the night she died?

06:24.208 --> 06:27.542
Dink's. That was our club.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.750
'I told her I'd meet her
if I got off in time,
but..'

06:30.834 --> 06:32.000
You worked late.

06:33.208 --> 06:34.875
If I had been there..

06:34.959 --> 06:38.041
...she wouldn't have been left
dying on the side of that road.

06:39.208 --> 06:40.667
It wasn't your fault, Will.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.083
He's got to pay for that.

06:42.166 --> 06:43.458
'And he will.'

06:43.542 --> 06:44.625
Let Jersey bring him in.

06:44.709 --> 06:47.291
What I do with this
is my business.

07:16.291 --> 07:18.125
Someone shot my mom?

07:19.583 --> 07:21.458
Who would do that?

07:21.542 --> 07:25.542
Abby...your mom
have any enemies?

07:25.625 --> 07:29.000
She was like a PTA mom.
No way.

07:29.083 --> 07:32.166
But...you'd been living
on the streets.

07:32.250 --> 07:34.917
For three months, yeah, but..

07:35.000 --> 07:36.834
...it wasn't always like that.

07:36.917 --> 07:39.583
'We had a nice house, a yard.'

07:39.667 --> 07:42.208
So, how'd you end up in the car?

07:42.291 --> 07:43.583
Dad got cancer..

07:44.542 --> 07:46.375
...and everything changed.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.417
The doctor bills wiped us out.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.709
We lost everything.

07:51.792 --> 07:54.458
Your mom have any
run-ins on the
street?

07:54.542 --> 07:58.375
Honestly, I-I don't remember
a lot about that time.

07:58.458 --> 08:00.458
You don't remember
being homeless?

08:00.542 --> 08:02.375
It sounds weird,
but what I remember

08:02.458 --> 08:06.375
from back then is...my mom
always being there.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.875
You were young.

08:07.959 --> 08:11.875
Maybe your sister...Natalie..

08:11.959 --> 08:13.583
'...will remember more.'

08:15.750 --> 08:19.125
Me and Natalie got separated
in foster care.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.583
I was lucky. I found a good
family right away.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.291
I take it Natalie didn't.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.834
(Abby)
'She was older.'

08:24.917 --> 08:27.375
No one wanted her for long.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.500
We just kind of grew apart.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.083
And she had changed anyway.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.208
Changed how?

08:33.291 --> 08:36.417
She believed
Mom took off...left us.

08:38.667 --> 08:41.166
But now she'll know
it wasn't that way, right?

08:41.250 --> 08:43.208
You didn't believe that?

08:43.291 --> 08:45.750
It was my tenth birthday.

08:45.834 --> 08:47.208
I knew she wouldn't leave us.

08:48.834 --> 08:51.375
Someone's going to talk
to my sister, right?

08:51.458 --> 08:52.792
Yeah.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.583
Tell her I miss her.

08:55.625 --> 08:56.875
Okay.

09:06.709 --> 09:09.291
Like I said,
I don't have a mother.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.000
She jumped ship way back.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.375
(Will)
'We found her this morning'

09:12.458 --> 09:15.250
at the bottom
of Fairmount Lake.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.583
She had been shot, Natalie.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.166
She probably did it to herself.

09:22.250 --> 09:23.792
The ultimate escape.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.750
You think your mother
killed herself?

09:25.834 --> 09:28.208
My mom was weak
and helpless.

09:28.291 --> 09:29.834
She didn't know how
to deal with life.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.709
It's a tough thing
losing a spouse.

09:31.792 --> 09:33.625
No excuse for being clueless.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.583
She didn't even know how
to balance a checkbook.

09:35.667 --> 09:37.125
Sounds like she got overwhelmed.

09:37.208 --> 09:38.917
And that's my problem how?

09:39.000 --> 09:41.750
(Will)
'Any idea who might have had
it out for your mother?'

09:42.792 --> 09:44.583
Besides the bums, derelicts

09:44.667 --> 09:46.750
'and drug addicts
who populated our new world?'

09:46.834 --> 09:48.959
Be specific, Natalie.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.667
The first night we lost
the house, my mom

09:50.750 --> 09:52.709
brought us
to a shelter in the city.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.125
Tough place to end up.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.750
You don't say.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.500
Is this where we're
going to live now, Mommy?

10:12.583 --> 10:14.125
No, baby.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.667
This is only for tonight.

10:16.834 --> 10:18.875
Just till I figure things out.

10:19.959 --> 10:21.291
Which one is ours?

10:22.125 --> 10:24.500
Um...twenty two.

10:32.542 --> 10:34.208
What are you looking at?

10:34.291 --> 10:35.792
I think there must be
a mix-up.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.333
There ain't no mix-up.

10:37.417 --> 10:39.625
It's the last bed, and you
ain't taking it from me.

10:39.709 --> 10:42.542
But we were guaranteed this bed.

10:42.625 --> 10:45.875
- The woman at intake said--
- You want this bed, take it.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.875
[scoffs]
Barbie here's going
to be turning tricks in no
time.

10:52.959 --> 10:54.375
Don't talk to my
daughter like that.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.500
What are you going
to do about it?

10:55.583 --> 10:58.291
Hey, what is going on here?

10:58.375 --> 10:59.458
Nothing.

11:00.667 --> 11:01.959
I was assigned this bed.

11:03.166 --> 11:04.875
- Vita.
- She don't even need a bed.

11:04.959 --> 11:07.083
You know the rules.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.667
Tell her to go sleep in that
car
I saw her pull up in.

11:09.750 --> 11:12.667
Mothers with kids
get the last bed.

11:19.500 --> 11:23.166
I see you again...
I'll kick your ass, bitch.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.834
We stayed just that one night.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.750
Figured we were safer
in the car.

11:33.834 --> 11:37.959
Maybe Marlene bumped into
this
Vita outside the shelter?

11:39.125 --> 11:40.917
I already told you
what happened.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.667
Your mom shot herself.

11:44.417 --> 11:46.583
Your sister Abby
doesn't think so.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.959
- She's young.
- She'd like to see you.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.709
She's with a good family now.
She doesn't need me.

11:51.792 --> 11:53.458
Not going to replace you.

11:53.542 --> 11:56.458
Maybe it isn't so
bad
if they did.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.041
Yeah.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.500
I was mad-dogging that woman.

12:13.583 --> 12:14.834
So what?

12:14.917 --> 12:16.875
- You did more than that,
Vita.
- You threatened her.

12:16.959 --> 12:18.625
Not long after,
she turned up
dead.

12:18.709 --> 12:21.041
Those were just words.
I barely even remember her.

12:21.125 --> 12:23.125
Well, a trip downtown
might jog your memory.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.291
I can't be skipping out
on my shift.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.208
I'm one paycheck away from being
back on the street as it is.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.667
Then answer the question.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.750
(Scotty)
'You ever run into
Marlene again?'

12:32.083 --> 12:34.208
The truth, Vita.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.583
- Yeah, I saw her, okay?
- Where?

12:36.667 --> 12:40.500
On her way to work, at that
store over on Broad Street.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.000
Thought she was a little bitch.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.542
A little bitch, huh?

12:45.625 --> 12:47.834
But home girl had more heart
than I thought.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.583
Mommy, where you going?

13:00.125 --> 13:01.750
Mommy has to work
the late shift tonight.

13:01.834 --> 13:04.750
- You're leaving us out here?
- I'll be right there.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.333
I can see you
through the window.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.291
We're the Bradford girls.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.375
We stick together.

13:15.458 --> 13:19.250
I'm sick of going to school in
clothes I slept in. It's gross.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.041
By the end of the month,
we'll have a place of our own

13:21.125 --> 13:23.000
and all this will be
a distant memory.

13:23.083 --> 13:24.458
That's what you said last month.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.041
This time it's going to happen.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.000
'Just stay
under the covers'

13:29.083 --> 13:31.542
and no one will even
know you're here.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.583
No employee parking.
Customers only.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.458
- I know, Mr. Patel.
- Move the car.

13:43.542 --> 13:44.959
What about my kids?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.542
(Patel)
'Take your kids home
to the sitter.'

13:46.625 --> 13:47.834
I can't afford a sitter.

13:47.917 --> 13:50.709
You don't like the rules,
get another job.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.583
I need this job. Please.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.000
Rules are rules.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.750
Get them out of here.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.041
Now.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.792
Well, maybe I'll call the INS.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.250
Tell them about the illegals
you have cleaning

14:08.333 --> 14:10.291
the store at night.

14:11.917 --> 14:13.417
Rules are rules.

14:15.834 --> 14:17.750
I'm not moving my car.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.583
You cross me?

14:21.166 --> 14:22.709
You'll regret it.

14:44.625 --> 14:47.291
Marlene started a war
with her boss.

14:47.375 --> 14:48.583
(Vita)
'I could have told her.'

14:48.667 --> 14:51.250
You can't win a war
with management.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.542
Now, if you don't mind,
I got to get back to work.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.667
Hi, welcome to Blue Mart.

14:58.041 --> 14:59.542
That was ballistics.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.500
Well, they got a hit on the
bullet found in Marlene's
car?

15:01.583 --> 15:03.125
From a .38 Colt revolver.

15:03.208 --> 15:06.000
- Now, that's specific.
- And guess who owns one?

15:06.083 --> 15:07.542
Marlene's boss.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.709
(Vera)
'Lost your business, Anil.'

15:20.792 --> 15:22.792
For hiring illegals.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.583
Common practice.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.500
The big superstores
pay a fine.

15:26.583 --> 15:28.875
Me? Ruined.

15:28.959 --> 15:31.125
Maybe you blamed
Marlene Bradford?

15:31.208 --> 15:34.542
Maybe it's 'cause of her you
got
to wear this...clown suit.

15:34.625 --> 15:35.917
What are you talking about?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.500
Marlene was a good employee.

15:38.583 --> 15:41.667
- That superstore was the
rat.
- Then why'd you shoot her?

15:41.750 --> 15:43.625
(Nick)
'She's dead, it was your gun
that killed her.'

15:43.709 --> 15:47.291
You know what? I'm seeing a new
uniform in your future, Anil.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.333
Bright orange jumpsuit.

15:48.417 --> 15:49.792
I bought that gun for the store.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.083
And you killed Marlene with it.

15:51.166 --> 15:53.333
No, you don't understand.
I gave it to her.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.125
(Nick)
'Sure you did.'

15:55.208 --> 15:56.542
I did.

15:56.625 --> 15:58.291
For her own protection.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.750
Mommy, the water's cold.

16:12.834 --> 16:14.250
I know.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.000
I'm sorry, baby.

16:16.083 --> 16:18.500
How come you can't get
an office job like Sarah's
mom?

16:18.583 --> 16:20.875
'Cause Mom can't find her way
out of a paper bag.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.750
(Marlene)
'Not a lot of job openings
for housewives'

16:22.834 --> 16:24.500
with one year of college.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.750
What the hell is going on here?

16:33.083 --> 16:34.875
Sorry, Mr. Patel.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.458
The girls needed a place
to wash up before school.

16:48.542 --> 16:50.417
Look, we're staying across town.

16:51.875 --> 16:53.875
You said no babysitter.

16:53.959 --> 16:55.583
But there's no house, is there?

16:59.458 --> 17:01.083
No one for you to stay with?

17:01.166 --> 17:02.583
No family?

17:02.667 --> 17:06.291
I just need a little more
time...to scrape up first

17:06.375 --> 17:09.041
and last month's rent and then
I'll be able to find a place.

17:09.125 --> 17:10.625
Please.

17:10.709 --> 17:13.458
You can use the facility
anytime you want..

17:13.542 --> 17:15.583
'...but the parking..'

17:15.667 --> 17:17.000
'I'm sorry.'

17:17.083 --> 17:18.583
If the customers can't park..

17:18.667 --> 17:20.083
...they find another store,
and I'm out of business.

17:20.166 --> 17:23.542
I just don't know where else
to go, where it's safe.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.125
(Hopper)
Oh, I know a place.

17:26.208 --> 17:27.834
Over there at, uh,
Fairmount Park

17:27.917 --> 17:30.333
at the, uh, Sweet Briar cutoff.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.542
Uh, don't let the looks
of me stop you.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.500
[chuckles]
It ain't the Ritz, but..

17:36.583 --> 17:38.000
...you're not going to be
there
long anyway.

17:39.417 --> 17:42.166
You're onto sunnier shores
real soon.

17:42.250 --> 17:45.125
You're one of the lucky ones.
I can tell.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.291
Thank you.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.333
Here.
For you.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.250
You're all alone.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.834
'Protect yourself.'

18:17.542 --> 18:20.667
- I can't take that.
- You have to.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.959
Think about your girls.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.875
Everybody needs a helping hand.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.375
Land of plenty?

18:41.083 --> 18:43.375
Not for people like Marlene.

18:43.458 --> 18:44.792
So, who was this homeless dude?

18:44.875 --> 18:47.542
Name's Hopper. A regular.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.250
Came in
for his daily lottery
ticket.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.959
You said Fairmount
Park at Sweet
Briar?

18:52.041 --> 18:53.500
Definitely.

18:53.583 --> 18:55.750
That's where
Marlene's
body was found.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.500
The canvas struck out.

19:01.583 --> 19:03.375
Hard to believe anybody would
stick around here

19:03.458 --> 19:05.208
'for eight years.'

19:05.291 --> 19:07.166
I thought Will
was coming
with.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.041
(Scotty)
'Will had something to do.'

19:09.125 --> 19:11.375
- Like what?
- Uh, wouldn't say.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.917
(Lilly)
'Vincent Hopper?'

19:16.000 --> 19:18.041
Philly P.D.

19:18.125 --> 19:21.625
Wanted to talk to you about
a woman named Marlene
Bradford?

19:21.709 --> 19:24.291
Her body was found
near here...in the lake.

19:28.041 --> 19:29.750
She didn't deserve that.

19:29.834 --> 19:31.875
One in a
million,
that Marlene.

19:31.959 --> 19:33.166
Nicest kids.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.625
You directed her here
back in '99.

19:35.709 --> 19:37.417
I thought
we'd be celebrating our
move

19:37.500 --> 19:39.458
to sunnier shores together.

19:39.542 --> 19:42.250
Oh, looks like she wasn't
the only one who didn't make
it.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.875
Ah, run of bad luck.

19:44.959 --> 19:46.291
Put me behind schedule.

19:47.166 --> 19:48.875
You're lucky I'm still here.

19:48.959 --> 19:51.250
There's a change
around the corner, you
know?

19:51.333 --> 19:53.709
Mm.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.375
You know something
about Marlene's disappearance?

19:56.458 --> 19:59.250
Marlene wasn't meant
for the streets.

19:59.333 --> 20:02.125
Last time I saw her,
it was only getting worse.

20:17.542 --> 20:19.250
Nat, you're supposed to be
in the car with Abby.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.709
I got to use the John
if you don't mind.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.834
You couldn't have taken her
with you?

20:23.917 --> 20:26.792
Jeez, can't I even take a pee
without her?

20:28.208 --> 20:30.834
And anyways
she's sound asleep.

20:36.792 --> 20:38.750
Ah, she's just
being a
teenager.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.500
[laughs]
She's better than
most
of them around here.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.959
You know everybody here,
don't you?

20:45.041 --> 20:48.083
After a few years, it gets easy.

20:48.166 --> 20:49.959
Years?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.166
But that's not going to be you.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.208
It's Abby's birthday tomorrow.

20:58.875 --> 21:01.291
I can't even get her a cake.

21:01.375 --> 21:02.875
Here.

21:06.542 --> 21:08.166
'It's a hope ticket.'

21:08.250 --> 21:10.083
(Marlene)
'A hope ticket?'

21:10.166 --> 21:12.792
Lets you dream about what
you'd do with the winnings.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.417
'A million dollars.'

21:16.959 --> 21:19.875
'Deal is, if you win,
you got to share the wealth.'

21:20.375 --> 21:22.333
'50-50.'

21:22.417 --> 21:24.375
Think of it as a finder's fee.

21:27.500 --> 21:29.667
What would you do with a half
a million dollars?

21:29.750 --> 21:31.750
Oh, I'd get my family back.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.542
Half a mill?

21:35.625 --> 21:39.083
I could provide
for my boy and his
mom.

21:39.166 --> 21:40.375
Like I should.

21:47.959 --> 21:49.834
How old were you
in this picture?

21:49.917 --> 21:53.458
My son's got his eye set
on this special glove.

21:54.875 --> 21:57.875
And I mean to get
it for him.
Mm-hmm.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.291
Then I'm sure you will.

22:05.375 --> 22:07.000
- Mom!
- What's the matter?

22:07.083 --> 22:08.792
- The car, it's gone.
- What?

22:08.875 --> 22:10.542
- Where's Abby?
- I don't know, Mom!

22:10.625 --> 22:13.166
- Where's your sister?
- She was in the car!

22:17.083 --> 22:19.542
(Lilly)
'The car disappeared
with Abby in it?'

22:20.792 --> 22:23.375
Guess she wasn't so lucky
after all.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.750
That happened the night
before Marlene was murdered.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.542
So, what did Marlene do?

22:27.625 --> 22:28.917
What any mother would do.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.291
She panicked.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.166
Whoa, you scared the crap
out of me, buddy.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.041
Just closing up.

22:56.792 --> 22:58.083
You need something?

22:58.166 --> 23:00.959
Winter of '95
was really something.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.834
Yeah, it was.

23:03.917 --> 23:05.667
Can't get it out
of my mind.

23:05.750 --> 23:08.792
Yeah, right. Well, you know,
I-I should finish closing.

23:08.875 --> 23:11.542
My wife was killed that night.

23:11.625 --> 23:14.166
'Hit-and-run trucker.'

23:14.250 --> 23:18.583
But you know that, don't you?

23:18.667 --> 23:21.333
- No.
- She didn't die right away.

23:21.417 --> 23:24.417
- Please.
- Took a while.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.917
Please. I-I..

23:26.000 --> 23:27.542
What-what do you,
what do you want?

23:27.625 --> 23:28.875
Money? Anything.

23:28.959 --> 23:32.125
What do you think
you can possibly give me?

23:32.208 --> 23:34.083
[stammering]
I-I don't know. I..

23:34.166 --> 23:36.333
- You left her there to die.
- Please. It was an accident.

23:36.417 --> 23:38.125
You just drove away.

23:39.917 --> 23:41.291
- Close your eyes.
- No. Please, please.

23:41.375 --> 23:43.458
Please don't
do this. Please.

23:43.542 --> 23:47.250
I said, close your eyes.

23:58.875 --> 24:00.458
(Scotty)
'No child abduction
reports filed'

24:00.542 --> 24:02.834
the night Marlene's
station wagon went
missing.

24:02.917 --> 24:05.375
Car wasn't even
reported stolen.

24:05.458 --> 24:07.333
Doesn't make sense.
Losing your kid.

24:07.417 --> 24:09.125
Parent's worst nightmare.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.834
Do almost anything
to get them back.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.667
So why not file a report?

24:12.750 --> 24:14.458
Maybe Marlene knew who stole it.

24:14.542 --> 24:15.750
Or maybe she got spooked.

24:15.834 --> 24:17.500
Cops could start
asking questions.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.500
Like what was Abby doing alone
in the car in the first place?

24:19.583 --> 24:21.333
Oh, single mother
living on the streets?

24:21.417 --> 24:23.166
State could take both girls.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.208
Easily.

24:24.291 --> 24:25.250
But her kid's missing.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.125
I think it's a chance
she'd take.

24:28.208 --> 24:29.875
The car was at a public park.

24:29.959 --> 24:31.542
Lot of restrictions.

24:31.625 --> 24:32.792
Yeah?

24:32.875 --> 24:34.875
What if it got towed?

24:41.000 --> 24:42.542
Marlene Bradford.

24:42.625 --> 24:46.417
Her car got towed
November '99, by you.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.291
Fellas, you know
how many cars I tow?

24:48.375 --> 24:51.041
Her car had a kid in it.
That ring any bells?

24:51.125 --> 24:52.458
According to the records,
Marlene racked up

24:52.542 --> 24:53.875
over $200 in fines.

24:53.959 --> 24:57.041
And she didn't have
that kind of dough.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.834
Somehow
she got her wheels back.

25:00.417 --> 25:03.667
Hm, like I said,
I don't remember.

25:03.750 --> 25:05.875
Look, bro..

25:05.959 --> 25:07.875
I've waived a few tickets
in my day.

25:07.959 --> 25:10.583
And they weren't
nearly
as hot as Marlene.

25:10.667 --> 25:13.792
[laughs]
You remember that,
uh, red Camaro?

25:13.875 --> 25:15.417
Oh.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.583
She stripped a few gears.

25:17.667 --> 25:19.458
I bet you fellas get over
a lot, huh?

25:19.542 --> 25:20.750
Eh, yeah.

25:20.834 --> 25:21.917
Job don't pay nothing, huh?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.041
Gotta make it up somehow.

25:23.125 --> 25:24.208
Yeah, damn right.

25:24.291 --> 25:26.583
That what happened with Marlene?

25:26.667 --> 25:28.000
You cut her a deal?

25:28.083 --> 25:29.208
Yeah, you could say that.

25:30.667 --> 25:34.250
Hey, nothing comes for free,
if you know what I mean.

25:46.375 --> 25:48.875
Mommy is so sorry, baby.

25:48.959 --> 25:52.291
I promise I'll never
leave you like that
again.

25:52.375 --> 25:57.041
I knew you'd come get me
'cause tomorrow's my birthday.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.959
It's amazing you'll even
be alive to see it.

26:00.041 --> 26:01.667
- Natalie.
- 'What?'

26:01.750 --> 26:06.083
- She could've been killed,
Mom.
- You don't think I know that?

26:06.166 --> 26:08.083
Just go inside..

26:08.166 --> 26:09.291
...where it's warm..

26:09.375 --> 26:11.500
...while I go talk
to the driver.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.375
Alright, it's
going to be
$279.

26:20.291 --> 26:21.542
I get paid tomorrow.

26:21.625 --> 26:23.291
- Maybe I could come by--
- Look, save it.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.291
You want your ride
tonight,
lady, you pay for it.

26:25.375 --> 26:26.667
No, you don't understand.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.417
If I don't get this car
out of here, my kids don't

26:28.500 --> 26:30.542
have anywhere
to sleep tonight.

26:30.625 --> 26:32.375
'That's not my problem, lady.'

26:36.875 --> 26:38.792
Look.

26:38.875 --> 26:41.542
I got something in the car.

26:41.625 --> 26:44.083
You could get a lot of cash
for it.

26:44.166 --> 26:45.750
Like?

26:45.834 --> 26:47.083
A gun.

26:49.750 --> 26:51.500
It's right here.

26:57.083 --> 26:59.875
It was right here!
It was right here!

26:59.959 --> 27:02.417
You stole it!

27:02.500 --> 27:04.875
Look, you want
your ride or not?

27:04.959 --> 27:06.542
I can't leave here without it.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.959
My girls..

27:17.542 --> 27:20.375
Other ways to settle
that tab, lady.

27:20.458 --> 27:21.709
What?

27:24.709 --> 27:27.291
'We've got nowhere else
to go, please.'

27:28.834 --> 27:30.083
Mom?

27:31.250 --> 27:32.625
What's taking so long?

27:34.917 --> 27:36.792
Just go back inside, baby.

27:39.583 --> 27:41.291
I'll be there in a minute.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.625
'Hey, what the hell?'

28:03.792 --> 28:05.125
Her kids
were in the next room.

28:05.208 --> 28:06.250
You took the gun, too,
didn't you?

28:06.333 --> 28:07.458
That's crazy.

28:07.542 --> 28:09.208
It didn't just walk away,
dirt bag.

28:09.291 --> 28:10.750
Hey, it was that girl.

28:10.834 --> 28:13.291
- What girl?
- The one that was in the
car.

28:13.375 --> 28:15.792
Look, I saw her take something
out of the glove box that
night.

28:16.834 --> 28:18.375
Abby took the gun?

28:21.667 --> 28:23.625
Time to stop pretending
you don't remember, Abby.

28:23.709 --> 28:24.917
I'm not pretending.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.333
Oh, certain things
you don't forget.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.583
Like being in a car
that's getting towed.

28:28.667 --> 28:31.166
And taking the gun
that killed your mom.

28:31.250 --> 28:33.041
I got scared.

28:33.125 --> 28:35.667
I saw the tow truck driver,
and I grabbed it.

28:36.917 --> 28:38.083
What about after?

28:40.709 --> 28:42.125
It's dangerous..

28:42.208 --> 28:44.250
...having a gun
in close quarters like
that.

28:44.333 --> 28:45.792
Maybe it went off accidentally.

28:45.875 --> 28:48.583
Maybe you got tired of
your
mother's empty promises.

28:48.667 --> 28:49.792
They weren't empty promises.

28:49.875 --> 28:52.542
You were living in a car,
Abby.
Come on.

28:52.625 --> 28:54.208
My mom did her best.

28:54.291 --> 28:56.667
Everything she did was for us.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.917
Only Natalie didn't see it.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.041
Promise not to tell Mom?

29:19.125 --> 29:21.375
Whatever,
stop being a baby.

29:23.834 --> 29:25.291
What are you doing with that?

29:25.375 --> 29:27.291
- It was in the glove box.
- It's not a toy, Abby!

29:27.375 --> 29:29.834
- I wasn't playing with it!
I--
- Shh!

29:31.709 --> 29:33.875
There must be, like,
50 cans in there.

29:33.959 --> 29:36.542
We hit the jackpot
tonight, girls.

29:39.792 --> 29:41.667
How much will we get for these?

29:41.750 --> 29:43.000
Lots.

29:43.083 --> 29:45.500
Guess what we're going
to do with the money?

29:45.583 --> 29:47.500
Something for my birthday?

29:47.583 --> 29:48.875
Something special.

29:48.959 --> 29:50.583
(Natalie)
'Like what?'

29:50.667 --> 29:53.250
Some cake you got
out of the garbage?

29:53.333 --> 29:55.208
[sighs]
Natalie, please.

29:56.709 --> 29:58.500
So, how did you
get the car back?

30:02.291 --> 30:03.792
I sold the gun.

30:16.375 --> 30:18.625
I know what you did.

30:18.709 --> 30:20.500
I'll get us out of this.

30:20.583 --> 30:22.208
How?

30:22.291 --> 30:25.000
By showing us houses
we're never going to live in?

30:25.083 --> 30:26.375
'We're better off
without you and your'

30:26.458 --> 30:27.917
stupid fantasy world.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.333
- Stop it, Natalie.
- 'You're disgusting!'

30:30.417 --> 30:32.542
- I hate you!
- You don't mean that.

30:32.625 --> 30:34.834
I wish it was you that died
instead of Dad.

30:39.959 --> 30:41.291
[gasping]
Natalie.

30:42.083 --> 30:44.792
Nat, I'm sorry, baby!

30:44.875 --> 30:46.083
'Natalie!'

30:46.166 --> 30:49.458
Natalie, come back! Nat!

30:51.792 --> 30:53.041
Natalie!

31:00.875 --> 31:02.417
Natalie loved Mom.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.917
She didn't mean it.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.083
But she left with the gun.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.375
And the next night
your mom was dead.

31:19.709 --> 31:21.458
[quietly]
Hello, John.

31:21.542 --> 31:22.792
Come in.

31:26.375 --> 31:29.166
You haven't picked
up your phone all
day.

31:30.083 --> 31:31.333
Hmm.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.959
All this time..

31:35.041 --> 31:38.125
...he wasn't what I imagined.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.291
What did you do, Will?

31:40.375 --> 31:43.083
I followed him into the alley.

31:44.417 --> 31:47.041
It was dark...raining.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.583
Go on.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.875
I put my gun to his chest.

31:58.375 --> 32:00.750
But I couldn't do it.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.875
I wanted him
to be a monster.

32:16.959 --> 32:18.667
But he wasn't.

32:18.750 --> 32:22.417
He was...just a guy in a diner.

32:26.917 --> 32:30.166
I thought...if I could do it..

32:32.417 --> 32:34.000
...it would make it better.

32:36.917 --> 32:38.208
It won't.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.917
You did the right thing.

32:46.667 --> 32:51.375
That night at Dink's,
they were playing Miles
Davis..

32:51.458 --> 32:54.208
...her favorite.

32:54.291 --> 32:56.417
'I, um..'

32:56.500 --> 32:59.208
...haven't played
one of his records since.

33:00.959 --> 33:03.083
It's been 12 years.

33:06.792 --> 33:08.917
A long time, Will.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.291
Yeah, it feels like yesterday.

33:17.458 --> 33:20.625
She's not coming back,
is she, John?

33:23.917 --> 33:26.083
No, she's not.

33:57.959 --> 34:00.417
Things got ugly
with you and your mom.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.417
"I hate you.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.709
Wish you were dead."

34:05.792 --> 34:07.625
- Harsh words.
- I was a kid.

34:07.709 --> 34:09.291
Kids mouth off.

34:09.375 --> 34:11.750
Difference is,
you had the gun that killed
her.

34:13.041 --> 34:15.959
You got something
to say, say it.

34:16.041 --> 34:18.959
At 14, it all seemed
so black and white.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.917
Life sucks because
you have a lousy mother.

34:21.000 --> 34:23.125
What do you
know about
it?

34:24.542 --> 34:25.917
More than I'd like to.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.291
Yeah, we all got problems, lady.

34:28.375 --> 34:30.542
- I'm out of here.
- Sit down.

34:34.709 --> 34:36.000
'No money.'

34:36.083 --> 34:37.583
No husband.

34:37.667 --> 34:39.667
No family.
Two kids to raise.

34:39.750 --> 34:41.250
'Your mom deserved
better from you.'

34:41.333 --> 34:44.250
She filled our heads
with empty promises and lies!

34:44.333 --> 34:46.458
She was trying to protect you.

34:48.959 --> 34:51.000
She didn't protect us.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.125
She left us
when we needed her the most.

34:53.208 --> 34:56.291
But she came looking for you,
didn't she, Natalie?

34:56.375 --> 34:58.083
After you ran off.

35:00.458 --> 35:02.250
Yeah, she found me.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.000
Where?

35:04.083 --> 35:05.291
Home.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.333
[whispering]
I thought I might
find you here.

35:31.542 --> 35:33.792
You have every right
to be angry.

35:41.125 --> 35:43.750
But I'm doing
my best, Natalie.

35:43.834 --> 35:46.166
Why can't you be real
for once, Mom?

35:47.625 --> 35:49.250
You want to know
what's real, Nat?

35:50.250 --> 35:52.333
I never thought I'd be a widow.

35:54.083 --> 35:57.208
I never thought
I'd lose our home.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.083
Your dad always
took care of everything.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.834
All I had to do was
love you and your sister.

36:01.917 --> 36:05.500
Maybe it's not
enough, Mom...love.

36:07.625 --> 36:09.500
It's all I've got.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.291
[sobbing]
How could he die on me?

36:27.333 --> 36:28.959
Still got each other, Mom.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.417
The Bradford
girls,
remember?

36:36.542 --> 36:39.041
We stick together.

36:40.834 --> 36:43.291
We got to go forward
with what we've got.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.583
We still got this, too.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.458
A lottery ticket?

36:51.542 --> 36:53.792
It's a hope ticket.

36:56.959 --> 36:58.583
It's worth a try, right?

37:06.250 --> 37:07.333
It's a winner.

37:08.333 --> 37:09.792
Twenty five bucks.

37:09.875 --> 37:12.583
Looks like Abby gets
her polar bear cake, after
all.

37:12.667 --> 37:15.250
And I can still
pay the finder's fee.

37:16.917 --> 37:18.959
How about I drive you
to school?

37:19.041 --> 37:20.709
And when you and Abby get home..

37:22.417 --> 37:24.709
...we'll have a real
birthday celebration.

37:27.750 --> 37:31.000
We waited for hours after
school
for her to show.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.583
I was an idiot to believe her.

37:36.458 --> 37:39.000
What about the gun, Natalie?

37:39.083 --> 37:40.834
I gave it back to my mom.

37:43.792 --> 37:48.000
Your mom said something
about paying a finder's fee?

37:48.083 --> 37:49.709
I don't know what she meant.

37:54.041 --> 37:56.500
Means you weren't the last
to see her that day.

38:01.125 --> 38:03.083
You lied, Hopper.

38:04.458 --> 38:05.834
Me? Lie?

38:05.917 --> 38:08.792
We know Marlene came
looking for you..

38:08.875 --> 38:10.834
...to pay the finder's fee.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.583
(Scotty)
'Was just your luck..'

38:12.667 --> 38:14.208
...that ticket being a winner.

38:14.291 --> 38:15.959
What are the chances, right?

38:16.041 --> 38:18.041
It's news to
me.
I had no idea.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.792
Oh, I think you did.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.542
So what happened, Hopper?
You get greedy?

38:23.625 --> 38:26.583
(Scotty)
'Wanted the 25 bucks
all to yourself?'

38:26.667 --> 38:29.375
Twenty five bucks?
It was a million dollars.

38:35.583 --> 38:36.750
You're right.

38:36.834 --> 38:38.125
A million.

38:39.458 --> 38:41.834
She was lucky.

38:41.917 --> 38:45.083
I know how to pick
'em,
I always did.

38:46.375 --> 38:48.375
You sure do.

38:48.458 --> 38:50.208
Just didn't count on her..

38:50.291 --> 38:51.959
'...cheating you like that.'

38:52.041 --> 38:54.166
She had no right
taking what was mine.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.709
So, you took it back,
your share.

38:56.792 --> 38:59.166
Damn right. It was my ticket.

38:59.250 --> 39:00.834
It was my chance.

39:00.917 --> 39:02.417
To get off the streets?

39:04.750 --> 39:08.583
To...get my world back..

39:10.667 --> 39:12.625
...and everything in it.

39:16.667 --> 39:17.959
(Marlene)
'Hopper!'

39:18.041 --> 39:20.583
[Marlene laughing]
'We won, Hopper!'

39:20.667 --> 39:22.125
(Hopper)
'What?'

39:22.208 --> 39:24.250
The lottery ticket.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.125
[laughing]
It's a
winner.

39:26.208 --> 39:27.417
Ah, I knew it.

39:30.417 --> 39:32.625
What did I say?

39:32.709 --> 39:34.959
One in a million, right?

39:36.291 --> 39:38.417
Here.

39:39.500 --> 39:40.834
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

39:40.917 --> 39:42.500
Come look at the birthday cake
I got for Abby.

39:42.583 --> 39:44.083
Wait, this is $12.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.000
Where's the rest of it?

39:49.083 --> 39:50.875
[chuckles]
What do you mean?

39:50.959 --> 39:52.917
The million we won.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.333
Million?

39:54.417 --> 39:56.542
[chuckles]
Hopper, you know how this
works.

39:56.625 --> 39:58.333
You're lucky
if you win two bucks.

39:58.417 --> 40:00.792
No, I'm going to get
my wife back.

40:00.875 --> 40:03.583
I'm going to play baseball
with my son.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.125
He wants that special glove

40:05.208 --> 40:06.625
'and I'm going
to get it for him.'

40:06.709 --> 40:08.291
Hopper..

40:08.375 --> 40:10.542
...that picture was from
a long time ago.

40:11.458 --> 40:12.667
You know that.

40:12.750 --> 40:14.792
No, no.

40:14.875 --> 40:16.834
I promised my boy that glove.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.041
Your son's not a kid anymore.

40:21.750 --> 40:23.875
He's a grown man.

40:26.750 --> 40:28.000
He is?

40:29.458 --> 40:30.959
'What's past is past.'

40:32.417 --> 40:34.583
We got to move on
with what we've got.

40:38.542 --> 40:40.083
You're just trying to keep
the money for yourself.

40:40.166 --> 40:42.083
No, that's crazy.

40:42.166 --> 40:43.208
(Hopper)
'Now, where is it?!'

40:43.291 --> 40:44.542
What are you...that's..

40:44.625 --> 40:47.834
What are you doing?!
Abby's birthday cake!

40:47.917 --> 40:49.417
(Hopper)
'I know it's here.'

40:52.083 --> 40:55.417
- You can't take what's mine.
- What have you done?

40:55.500 --> 40:57.166
It's my ticket.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.291
Hopper, don't.

41:03.291 --> 41:04.583
- It's my hope.
- 'Stop.'
