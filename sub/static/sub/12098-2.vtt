09:46.652 --> 09:48.653
It's because I'm gay.

09:48.654 --> 09:50.155
No, Lord sakes,
you're the father.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.656
I like you.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.658
Then what is it?

09:54.160 --> 09:55.161
Alice.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.163
Alice.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.664
Look,
I know what you're thinking.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.167
If I can accept you,
I can accept her.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.668
I mean, I know it's silly.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.171
What's another homo,
more or less?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.674
But Jodie, I just can't help it.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.176
One homo, fine,

10:11.177 --> 10:14.680
but two homos,
that's just one homo too many.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.683
Mrs. David, excuse me,
but this is my home,

10:18.684 --> 10:20.685
and Alice is my friend.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.188
Now, I am very grateful to you
for bringing Wendy to see me,

10:23.189 --> 10:25.190
but seeing as how Carol
abandoned her,

10:25.191 --> 10:27.692
she is now
my legal responsibility.

10:27.693 --> 10:31.196
But Jodie, if you insist
on having Alice stay here,

10:31.197 --> 10:33.198
I'm going to have to
take the baby back to Texas

10:33.199 --> 10:34.199
with me.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.700
I'll take you to court.

10:35.701 --> 10:37.202
You'll lose.
No, I won't.

10:37.203 --> 10:39.204
Two homosexuals
bringing up a little baby?

10:39.205 --> 10:40.205
You won't stand a chance

10:40.206 --> 10:43.208
in court.

10:43.209 --> 10:45.210
Oh.

10:45.211 --> 10:48.213
Jodie, I'm sorry.
I don't want to hurt you.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.215
I...

10:50.216 --> 10:51.716
I don't want to keep you
from your daughter.

10:51.717 --> 10:57.722
But I'm her grandmother,
and I can't help the way I feel.

10:57.723 --> 10:59.724
You're asking me to choose

10:59.725 --> 11:01.727
between my best friend
and my child.

11:09.235 --> 11:14.740
If you love your child,
the choice is easy.

11:33.259 --> 11:34.759
Wait up. Slow down.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.760
Your steps are too big.

11:35.761 --> 11:39.264
Get yourself
a pair of legs, pal.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.765
All right, through that door.

11:40.766 --> 11:41.766

11:44.270 --> 11:45.270
Listen, you don't understand.

11:45.271 --> 11:47.272
My wife, she really gets
very upset...

11:47.273 --> 11:48.773
Hey, pal... Hey!

11:48.774 --> 11:49.774
I'm entitled

11:49.775 --> 11:51.777
to one phone call, you know.

12:03.789 --> 12:06.791
The bunk on the bottom
belongs to me.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.793
Fine.

12:08.794 --> 12:10.795
Also, the front of the closet
belongs to me.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.297
Good, right.
And in the morning,

12:12.298 --> 12:13.798
I'm the first one
in the bathroom.

Hey, Saul...

I swear.

12:41.827 --> 12:43.328
Listen, when they captured you,

12:43.329 --> 12:44.329
they didn't tell you

12:44.330 --> 12:45.830
they're going to
let you go soon?

12:45.831 --> 12:46.831
Yeah.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.833
They have no concept of time.

I don't understand.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.358
What do they want us for?

13:13.359 --> 13:15.360
What were you doing
when they captured you?

13:15.361 --> 13:16.861
I was a writer.

Oh, hey, I saw <i>Exodus.</i>

13:29.875 --> 13:31.876
Otto Preminger wrote it.

13:31.877 --> 13:33.378
Okay? No, listen.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.880
It was... It was
Eva Marie Saint and Sal Mineo.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.882
What are you talking about,
"Sal Mineo"?

13:37.883 --> 13:39.384
I'm talking about <i>Exodus.</i>

Moses.

Yeah, Moses.

going to be worried sick.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.900

13:55.901 --> 13:57.902

who knew Moses.

"Da, da, da, lunatic."

Although I am known

14:31.937 --> 14:33.938
for my delightful
sense of humor,

14:33.939 --> 14:35.440
this is no joke.

14:35.441 --> 14:38.443
They captured me
just like they captured you.

I am not a lunatic.

They are a very advanced people.

Well, they abolished aging.

I wish I was a lunatic,

14:48.954 --> 14:50.455

14:50.456 --> 14:53.459
and we would stand a chance.

staying here, pal.

that those shoes
with that handbag

All you have to do
is sign a statement

saying
you'll turn state's evidence.

by a guy named "Knuckles."

17:09.595 --> 17:11.095
What do you expect?

17:11.096 --> 17:13.097
And you can forget about
that state's evidence stuff.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.598

Why can't you just cooperate
with the authorities?

17:20.105 --> 17:22.607
Eunice, what kind of a man
do you think I am?

17:24.108 --> 17:25.609
We got a code in prison, Eunice,

17:25.611 --> 17:27.111
and the code says,

17:27.112 --> 17:29.614
"A man doesn't fink
on his fellow inmates."

17:29.615 --> 17:30.615

17:30.616 --> 17:33.618
You're choosing some stupid code
over me?

You're willing to blow

of being together for a code?

this could be my last chance.

let me tell you something...

Listen to me.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.134

17:50.135 --> 17:52.136

the beautiful one,

17:53.639 --> 17:55.139
always the talented one.

She got the ballet lessons,
and I got her hand-me-downs.

She was the apple
of everybody's eye

18:01.647 --> 18:03.147
You made me feel

18:03.148 --> 18:05.149
like I was somebody special.

18:05.150 --> 18:08.153
Like I was important
and wonderful.

You were the first one

"I love her... for what she is."

told anyone before.
