00:01.080 --> 00:02.069
<i>Hi, I'm Chuck.</i>

00:02.240 --> 00:03.832
<i>Here are things</i>
<i>that you might need to know.</i>

00:04.000 --> 00:05.797
As the assistant manager
and your boss...

00:05.960 --> 00:09.270
...it's my duty to inform you
that I've had complaints from customers.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.078
General, what exactly is the Cipher?

00:11.240 --> 00:14.596
<i>The Cipher is the artificial brain</i>
<i>for the new Intersect computer.</i>

00:14.760 --> 00:16.830
<i>Tomorrow, the new computer goes online.</i>

00:17.000 --> 00:19.514
<i>Operation Bartowski</i>
<i>officially comes to an end.</i>

00:19.680 --> 00:21.272
<i>Enjoy the rest of your life, Chuck.</i>

00:21.440 --> 00:23.237
You can do anything. I've seen you.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.152
Anything you wanted you could have.

00:25.320 --> 00:27.276
Do you wanna go on a date sometime?

00:27.440 --> 00:28.429
Okay.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.149
We have to call off the date.
The Intersect was destroyed.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.753
What? But the Cipher...

00:32.920 --> 00:34.831
It was a Trojan horse, a sabotage device.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.513
The moment it came online...

00:37.760 --> 00:39.398
You're still the only Intersect.

00:44.320 --> 00:45.799
I don't get it.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.110
This time today,
I was supposed to be a free man.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.510
No more Intersect,
possibly reclining on a beach...

00:50.680 --> 00:52.796
...with a colada
and some undisclosed companion.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.757
- What the hell happened?
- It's technical.

00:54.920 --> 00:57.639
It's a computer malfunction.
I can help. That's my department.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.030
It exploded into a million pieces,
Graham with it.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.918
You wanna help?
Get some rubber gloves.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.672
Wait, wait, wait. Graham is dead?

01:03.840 --> 01:05.990
We're playing for keeps here, Chuck.

01:06.560 --> 01:09.950
Well, at the risk of sounding callous,
where's that leave us with the Intersect?

01:10.120 --> 01:13.749
I'd get used to working at the Buy More.
You ain't leaving anytime soon.

01:16.840 --> 01:19.195
Gentlemen, females...

01:19.360 --> 01:20.998
...as the new assistant manager...

01:21.160 --> 01:24.197
...I just want you to know that things
are gonna run differently here.

01:24.360 --> 01:26.396
Because we did our time together
in the trenches...

01:26.560 --> 01:29.313
...I know what screwups most of you are,
for example, Jeffrey.

01:29.480 --> 01:32.631
You spend the hours of 3 and 5
sleeping in the employee bathroom.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.199
Dude, that was our secret.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.879
Morgan, no more borrowing company
DVDs and then reshrink-wrapping them.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.793
What? That's outrageous, man.
I've never heard such a thing.

01:41.960 --> 01:44.190
- I'm insulted that you would...
- Oh, but... Oh, no.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.193
Oh, okay. Okay, okay, company DVDs
you're saying, right.

01:47.360 --> 01:51.399
Please call me Mr. Patel or boss,
or for our Latin friend, <i>el jefe.</i>

01:51.560 --> 01:52.993
- Questions?
- Uh, Chuck.

01:53.160 --> 01:55.230
- When are we offering...?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.992
All questions are address directly to me.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.354
<i>- El jefe.</i>
- Thank you.

01:58.520 --> 02:00.272
When are we offering
low-interest credit cards?

02:00.440 --> 02:03.238
Ah, yes, yes, yes. When are we...?

02:03.400 --> 02:04.389
- Today.
- Today.

02:04.560 --> 02:06.676
Morgan, get the displays out.
Any other questions?

02:06.840 --> 02:07.875
Good. Dismissed.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.792
I can't believe this is my life.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.110
Morgan, do you remember a time
when I had potential?

02:12.280 --> 02:14.874
You kidding me?
Yeah, you were bursting with it.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.393
Man, I'm glad that's over with.

02:17.720 --> 02:18.755
I'm kidding. Come on.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.957
We all know that you're gonna go on
to do great things, all right? Great things.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.712
But until that day, just know...

02:23.880 --> 02:28.158
...that no matter how bad your life gets,
you get to go home to that.

02:30.000 --> 02:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.360 --> 03:10.591
Is that, uh, a real kiss or a cover kiss?
Because I'm confused right now.

03:10.760 --> 03:14.594
A we-have-a-national-security-emergency
and-l-need-to-speak-to-you-privately kiss.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.796
I knew I felt something.
Who's your mama?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.429
Hey, I got an idea.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.036
Why don't we blow off this whole thing
and go to Mexico for a couple of days?

03:22.200 --> 03:25.158
I'll get the daiquiris
if the CIA picks up the plane tickets.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.754
Chuck, I told you, we can't be together.
It's unprofessional.

03:29.080 --> 03:31.878
Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you
with Bryce Larkin, super spy...

03:32.040 --> 03:33.234
...when you were together?

03:33.400 --> 03:36.153
Bryce was a spy. You're an asset.
And my job is to protect you.

03:36.320 --> 03:38.072
Wait a minute. Why are we in a freezer?

03:38.240 --> 03:40.037
All this to protect your toppings?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.553
What the...? Hello.

03:47.040 --> 03:48.678
This is new. What is this place?

03:48.840 --> 03:51.308
The CIA decided to spring for new digs.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.789
Finally, a first-rate operation.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.191
Wow.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.794
Looks expensive.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.951
You guys are planning
on staying for a while?

04:01.120 --> 04:04.590
<i>- That depends on you, Chuck.</i>
- How does it depend on me?

04:04.760 --> 04:07.718
<i>Colt fed us</i>
<i>a Trojan horse that blew up the Intersect.</i>

04:07.880 --> 04:09.279
<i>The real Cipher is still out there.</i>

04:09.440 --> 04:11.670
<i>Our intel tells us</i>
<i>it may be in the possession...</i>

04:11.840 --> 04:14.308
<i>...of the former KGB operative,</i>
<i>Sasha Banacheck.</i>

04:14.480 --> 04:16.435
<i>We believe she's in town to sell it.</i>

04:16.600 --> 04:18.430
So why don't we grab her and find out?

04:18.600 --> 04:21.160
<i>Sasha Banacheck was in</i>
<i>a Bulgarian prison for seven years.</i>

04:21.320 --> 04:22.548
<i>They got nothing out of her.</i>

04:22.720 --> 04:25.075
<i>The good news is,</i>
<i>one agent was able to get close.</i>

04:25.240 --> 04:26.719
<i>He's the reason she went away.</i>

04:26.880 --> 04:28.916
<i>And he knows more about her</i>
<i>than anyone alive.</i>

04:29.080 --> 04:31.230
That agent is Roan Montgomery.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.119
Crap. The guy hates me.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.999
My supervisor in operative training.
Flunked me twice.

04:37.160 --> 04:40.596
<i>He's off the grid now. Use the Intersect</i>
<i>to find Agent Montgomery.</i>

04:40.760 --> 04:41.795
All right.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.315
Guys, sounds like a blast, really.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.630
Uh, but you can count me out
on this one.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.110
No more dangling me off buildings.
No more guns being pointed at my head.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.793
No more putting my life in danger.

04:51.960 --> 04:56.192
I am going back to my peaceful, quiet,
albeit degrading life at the Buy More.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.554
So have fun on the mission.

04:57.720 --> 05:00.792
And really love what you've done
with the place.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.076
<i>Is there a problem with the asset?</i>

05:03.240 --> 05:06.710
No problem, general.
I have the situation under control.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.029
Chuck, wait.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.633
- Chuck, wait.
- Sarah, look.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.552
You're right, okay? I'm not a real spy.

05:11.720 --> 05:13.756
I'm not cut out
for this adrenaline pumping...

05:13.920 --> 05:17.469
...risk-life-and-limb daily existence.
- The sooner we get the Cipher...

05:17.640 --> 05:19.790
...the sooner you can have
the Intersect removed.

05:19.960 --> 05:23.635
You can be free to live whatever life
you choose with whomever you choose.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.713
What are you saying?

05:25.880 --> 05:30.635
I'm saying that you can have
everything that you've always wanted.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.435
Let me see the file.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.069
Wow. Okay.

05:48.240 --> 05:51.038
Uh, the guy lives in Palm Springs
and he's got a lot of lady friends.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.550
So, what's the deal with this Roan guy?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.995
He's a legend in the department.
An incredible spy.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.799
- Real old-school James Bond type.
- Overrated, if you ask me.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.393
What was the class that you failed?

06:03.560 --> 06:05.596
Infiltration and Inducement
of Enemy Personnel.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.990
Yeah, at the academy,
we call it seduction school.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.878
Yeah, like I need a class.

06:10.480 --> 06:12.789
Wait, someone's already been here.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.156
Yeah, and they ransacked the place.

06:26.440 --> 06:28.795
Oh, my God.
Oh, um, maybe I should wait in the car.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.916
I'm having nightmares
about the last few dead bodies.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.353
- I've got a flight to catch.
- Oh.

06:41.640 --> 06:43.710
This is the guy that's supposed to help?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.272
I'm gonna be the Intersect forever.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.150
Good morning, sunshine.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.876
What do you say we hit the shower
for a quickie?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.429
- Mm-hm.
- Sorry, Chuck.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.398
You know what, it would be nice
if we had some romance on occasion.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.039
I've got a good 42 minutes...

07:41.200 --> 07:44.078
...before I have to perform
an emergency endotracheal intubation.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.434
Ha, ha, that's very funny.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.070
Do you realize that you have not taken me
on one date since we've been engaged?

07:49.240 --> 07:50.355
Took you out last week.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.795
To Arby's
with Chuck and his little bearded friend.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.076
It's not exactly every girl's dream.
No offense, Chuck.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.275
None taken.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.590
I guess I have been remiss
in the romance department.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.876
What we need to be
is more like Chuck and Sarah.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.474
- Excuse me?
- When you see her, your eyes light up.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.198
How do you keep that spark alive?

08:05.640 --> 08:07.790
I don't think
I should be getting involved...

08:07.960 --> 08:09.075
What's the secret, bro?

08:09.240 --> 08:11.879
We kind of just...
We pretend like we're not really dating.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.075
Which is weird, I know.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.516
But it forces me to have to win her over
again and again.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.193
Aw.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.635
- And again.
- That is so sweet.

08:20.800 --> 08:24.918
Honey, see, all I'm talking about
is simply an evening of wining and dining.

08:25.080 --> 08:27.435
I hear you, babe. Mission accepted.

08:27.920 --> 08:29.319
<i>The mission is the Cipher.</i>

08:29.480 --> 08:32.438
<i>The brains of the Intercept,</i>
<i>the most important piece.</i>

08:32.600 --> 08:35.797
If Sasha Banacheck has a Cipher,
we've got 24 hours before she unloads it.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.916
<i>What's wrong?</i>
<i>Did you find Agent Montgomery?</i>

08:38.080 --> 08:42.198
We did. It's just he's having
a bit of trouble remaining upright.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.033
Water, aspirin.
The guy's out.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.590
If we want Sasha Banacheck,
it's up to us.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.638
G-man, G-man, G-man. Hello, Giorgio.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.469
Thanks, Casey.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.551
I suggest going old school.
Torture it out of her.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.835
Torture will never work.

09:16.520 --> 09:17.635
Hello, Diane.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.398
<i>Hello, Roan.</i>

09:21.240 --> 09:24.118
The only way to get Sasha Banacheck
is to seduce her.

09:24.440 --> 09:25.555
Well, duty calls.

09:25.720 --> 09:28.280
Not you, Agent Frankenstein,
she'll peg you as CIA.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.032
We need somebody innocuous...

09:30.200 --> 09:32.634
...someone with whom
she can let her guard down.

09:32.800 --> 09:36.429
Essentially, the last person in the world
she'd ever suspect of being an agent.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.677
Charles, I'd like to have these
Nerd Herd invoices logged today.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.671
Uh, Lester, these are all from your jobs.

09:42.840 --> 09:45.513
Correct. During your brief tenure
as the assistant manager...

09:45.680 --> 09:47.318
...you should've had me deal with it.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.118
Now I have to clean up your mess.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.589
Come on, brother.
Time for you to show me something.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.960
Let's go, lover boy. I need
your services in a romantic capacity.

09:56.120 --> 09:58.714
Oh, I'm flattered.
I just hope Sarah's involved.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.394
So your date tonight
will be with Sasha Banacheck.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.675
I'm sorry, what?

10:02.840 --> 10:05.400
Previously-tortured-in-a-Bulgarian-prison
Sasha Banacheck?

10:05.560 --> 10:07.278
Casey and I will be there for cover.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.193
Just approach her at the bar
and get her to invite you up...

10:10.360 --> 10:12.271
...and see if you flash on anything
in her room.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.476
One small problem.
Why is she gonna choose me?

10:14.640 --> 10:17.518
Because you're not
going to be you, you're going to be me.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.549
I'll teach you
everything you need to know.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.029
First, the proper way to drink a martini.

10:24.200 --> 10:27.795
Hold by stem. Nod to mark.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.749
Slowly tilt back.

10:35.120 --> 10:38.351
A moment to learn, a lifetime to perfect.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.272
Let's get to work.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.029
Whoa.

10:42.200 --> 10:45.317
- Come on.
- His liver must look like camouflage.

10:49.040 --> 10:50.519
Hey, Morgan, you seen Chuck?

10:50.680 --> 10:52.432
He, uh, left early. Why? What's up?

10:52.600 --> 10:54.750
I wanna see if he can
make himself scarce tonight.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.514
Planning a romantic evening
with my lady.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.353
Really? Check you out, you big softie.

11:00.520 --> 11:02.829
What's on the agenda,
if I may be so bold?

11:03.000 --> 11:07.357
Not sure. I may pick up some flowers,
some candles, vino.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.829
- Feed each other some jumbo shrimp.
- Oh.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.310
- You know about Ellie and shrimp, right?
- No, what?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.833
Famous Nantucket trip of '92.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.911
Spent days curled up
on a bathroom floor.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.719
For years, she couldn't go near a beach
without vomiting.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.552
What else you got?

11:21.720 --> 11:24.518
- Her favorite dessert, pecan pie.
- Okay, she likes pecan pie.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.434
Not her stuck-on-a-desert-island
all-time favorite, but she likes it.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.591
Morgan, ha, ha, I know my fiancée.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.590
Really? How long have you been in love
with Ellie for? Three years?

11:34.760 --> 11:36.591
- Give or take.
- Ha, ha.

11:36.760 --> 11:38.398
Take a walk for a second.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.870
I have dedicated myself
to the study of that woman for 19 years.

11:42.040 --> 11:45.316
I hate to pull rank here,
but I think I know Ellie better than you.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.836
All right? For example, for example, what
is Ellie's favorite song of eighth grade?

11:49.000 --> 11:50.479
Ha, ha. Why eighth grade?

11:50.640 --> 11:52.119
Oh, man, you don't know. That's okay.

11:52.280 --> 11:55.397
You came to the right place, all right?
We are gonna set her off.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.117
You're not gonna wear that shirt, right?

12:00.280 --> 12:04.034
I need to see what I'm dealing with.
Assume your partner is the mark.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.633
How would you seduce her?

12:05.800 --> 12:07.074
That's an excellent question.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.994
I would probably start
with the, uh, bedroom eyes, maybe.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.549
You know,
the old Bartowski eyebrow dance.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.551
And come in at you like this, you know.

12:15.720 --> 12:18.314
- And then I'd start firing the guns at you.
- Ha, ha.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.835
Don't encourage him.
This isn't happy hour at Chili's.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.399
This is Sasha Banacheck.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.039
I don't know. I would probably...

12:24.200 --> 12:27.192
You know, I'd be myself
and I'd try and make her laugh a little bit.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.316
Find a common cultural interest. Music.

12:29.480 --> 12:30.469
Be yourself?

12:30.640 --> 12:34.633
Do you think a woman like this
could ever fall for a guy like you?

12:34.800 --> 12:35.949
I don't know.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.839
Barring any national security emergency,
I think I might have a shot.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.310
Be reasonable. This is a gorgeous
and sophisticated woman.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.675
- And you're...
- Passionate and sweet and caring.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.875
Really?

12:46.040 --> 12:47.632
Tall, dark and caring. What a combo.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.030
I didn't mean it like that.
He has a lot to offer.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.668
Fine. Let me see this caged passion.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.068
- Kiss him.
- Excuse me?

12:54.240 --> 12:57.710
I don't think that's necessary
at this particular juncture right now, Roan.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.030
I'm solid as a rock in that department.

13:00.200 --> 13:03.397
What's wrong?
Don't you find Agent Walker attractive?

13:03.560 --> 13:06.154
Of course I find her attractive.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.993
It's just that I had a burrito earlier,
and I'm trying to be respectful.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.958
While I admire your chivalry,
if you can't kiss her now...

13:12.120 --> 13:14.793
...what makes you think
you're gonna kiss Sasha Banacheck...

13:14.960 --> 13:16.712
...when the entire mission is on the line?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.518
- Chuck, it's okay.
- Really?

13:18.680 --> 13:20.113
Yes. Yes.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.350
- There.
- Have you had intercourse before?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.431
You know what? You're crazy.
This is crazy.

13:32.600 --> 13:33.874
I don't have to take lessons.

13:34.040 --> 13:36.429
Maybe I picked the wrong agent.
I'll get Agent Casey.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.511
- You want me to kiss her?
- Desperately.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.908
Fine.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.199
Bravo.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.032
I'd better fix my lipstick. Excuse me.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.553
Sure.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.716
That wasn't the first time
that's happened.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.110
What? No.
No, we're totally professional.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.111
- We work together.
- Don't worry, Charles.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.512
I'll teach you how to get her too.
But first, we're gonna need more gin.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.352
We're dead.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.711
Okay. You make sure his mike works.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.916
I'll go load up the weapons.

14:24.080 --> 14:25.638
Oh, it may not be the steamiest...

14:25.800 --> 14:29.315
...but we probably have the strangest
relationship in Los Angeles.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.550
I doubt that. Morgan's still dating, right?

14:32.360 --> 14:33.873
Good point.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.029
Tonight will be fine.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.714
I wouldn't take Roan's advice
too seriously. Just be yourself.

14:37.880 --> 14:40.110
I doubt Chuck Bartowski's
gonna be charming anyone.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.510
Why not? Worked on me.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.071
- We need to talk about protection.
- I don't think it's gonna get that far.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.832
I mean a gun.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.275
Why do you think she's known
as the Black Widow?

14:52.440 --> 14:54.795
She's African American
and her husband died.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.598
Because she kills all her mates.

15:07.920 --> 15:09.592
Big Mike. Hey.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.273
Uh, you wanted to see me?

15:11.440 --> 15:13.590
First, I'm digging the new vest.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.354
Oh, ha, ha, thank you.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.159
Next, why aren't
my credit-card displays out?

15:18.320 --> 15:22.029
Yeah, I've told Morgan three times, sir.
But don't worry, I am on it.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.510
- They ain't listening to you.
- It's just a matter of time, sir.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.432
The problem is, they don't fear you.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.160
Yeah. Yeah, you're right,
they don't, they don't.

15:30.320 --> 15:31.594
How do I get them to fear me?

15:31.760 --> 15:34.797
Don't you watch Animal Planet?
Find the wounded gazelle and pounce.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.114
Thus endeth the lesson.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.797
If he survives the night,
it will be a miracle.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.793
- <i>He can hear you.</i>
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.757
Don't be nervous, Chuck.
We'll be watching you.

15:58.920 --> 16:02.310
I'm gonna walk you through the famous
four-pronged Montgomery attack.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.869
<i>First, work the room.</i>

16:14.560 --> 16:17.120
When you enter a room,
every eye should be upon you.

16:17.280 --> 16:19.953
<i>You could leave the bar</i>
<i>with any woman you desire...</i>

16:20.120 --> 16:23.112
<i>...but you have chosen her.</i>

16:24.080 --> 16:25.354
Easy, Chuck, you're doing great.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.988
Next, she'll need to be well-lubricated.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.996
<i>Ice-cold dirty martini.</i>

16:31.640 --> 16:33.039
Three olives.

16:36.040 --> 16:38.076
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

16:38.680 --> 16:40.318
I'll take that as no.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.630
Charles Carmichael. And you are?

16:42.800 --> 16:44.950
- Bored.
- Well, maybe I can change that.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.031
- Garçon.
- May I help you?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.350
Yes, sir.
Please, two ice-cold dirty martinis.

16:49.520 --> 16:51.033
Three olives. Thank you.

16:51.960 --> 16:52.949
That's very nice.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.155
But I no longer drink.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.399
Doesn't drink? That's...

16:56.560 --> 16:59.996
I'm sorry. How is this boy
supposed to seduce her without alcohol?

17:00.160 --> 17:01.673
Don't worry, Chuck. It'll be fine.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.957
I should probably cut back too.
A lot of calories in those martinis.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.950
Enjoy your martinis, Mr. Carmichael.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.270
<i>It's okay. Don't get discouraged.</i>

17:11.440 --> 17:12.953
<i>That was just round one.</i>

17:13.119 --> 17:15.111
You're calm, confident, charming.

17:15.280 --> 17:17.839
Yeah, apparently not.
She left after 12 seconds.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.388
You're still alive, aren't you?
That's a victory.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.675
Okay, Chuck. Here we go.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.111
A woman wants a man to take control.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.635
Even though she won't say it,
she wants to be rescued.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.358
Actually, that's not true, Chuck.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.273
Some women prefer a man
who can take a back seat.

17:32.840 --> 17:35.912
- I'm talking about the Black Widow.
- So am I.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.071
Maybe he doesn't need
to pretend to be someone else.

17:38.240 --> 17:41.198
I promise you, Chuck Bartowski
on his own can seduce this woman.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.079
I appreciate all of that,
but can we focus on the mission?

17:44.240 --> 17:46.151
Yes, Charles. All right, the third prong.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.910
<i>The woman is an absolute Francophile.</i>

17:49.080 --> 17:51.753
<i>Just the mention of Saint-Tropez</i>
<i>makes her woozy.</i>

17:54.640 --> 17:57.552
I hate to keep bothering you,
but you look so familiar.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.278
Perhaps we met in Saint-Tropez.

18:01.520 --> 18:02.714
At the Intercontinental.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.950
At the Intercontinental.

18:10.680 --> 18:13.513
Antoine the piano player
is best in Europe, don't you agree?

18:13.680 --> 18:17.514
Oh, I'm a big, big fan of Antoine's.
Wouldn't miss him for the world.

18:18.040 --> 18:19.792
Antoine has been dead for six years.

18:20.880 --> 18:23.678
Aw, poor Antoine. That's tragic.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.751
That is a shame. No one ever called.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.909
But you prefer the new piano player,
Marcel.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.230
For my money, though, I prefer Marcel.

18:34.400 --> 18:37.278
Better solos, longer jams,
just more of an accomplished pianist.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.668
But maybe that's just me.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.309
I have to agree.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.990
Barkeep, a refill for the lady, please.

18:49.760 --> 18:50.795
To Antoine.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.838
May he rest in peace.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.717
Are you prepared for an evening
of intense seduction?

19:02.880 --> 19:03.915
Can't wait.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.832
This is very sweet. What did you do?

19:06.000 --> 19:07.433
Patience, babe.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.398
First, some tunes.
I'm taking it old school.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.393
Does the eighth grade lunchroom
ring any bells?

19:13.560 --> 19:15.198
That's right.
Richard Marx, <i>Repeat Offender.</i>

19:17.040 --> 19:18.553
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.631
Next, a little something
for the sweet tooth.

19:20.800 --> 19:21.835
Your favorite dessert.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.594
Seriously, babe,
what would you do for a Klondike Bar?

19:24.760 --> 19:27.797
- I guess we'll find that out later. Ha, ha.
- Not much.

19:27.960 --> 19:31.111
And finally,
for the evening's entertainment...

19:31.280 --> 19:33.271
...your favorite all-time movie.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.112
<i>- Casablanca.</i>
- No.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.952
<i>Sister Act.</i>

19:38.920 --> 19:41.434
Honey, why,
out of all the movies in the world...

19:41.600 --> 19:43.158
...would <i>Sister Act</i> be my favorite?

19:43.320 --> 19:46.517
Morgan said he sat behind you
in the theater and you were hysterical.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.796
I have no recollection of that.

19:48.960 --> 19:51.952
You consulted Morgan
for an evening of intense seduction?

19:52.560 --> 19:54.198
Technically, he has known you longer.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.555
Okay. You know what?

19:56.720 --> 20:01.032
Just for future reference,
my favorite dessert is pecan pie.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.792
Well, that's what I said.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.154
Hey, wait, where you going?

20:04.320 --> 20:05.912
I have to be up at 5 a.m.

20:06.080 --> 20:08.230
- What about our date?
- Well, why don't you call Morgan?

20:08.400 --> 20:11.756
Since evidently you planned
his favorite evening. Okay?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.231
That furry little bastard.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.075
So how long have you
and Charles been cavorting?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.595
You mean, how long
have we been working together?

20:23.760 --> 20:25.830
Don't play coy.
You have feelings for him.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.070
<i>I mean, real, non-spy emotions.</i>

20:28.240 --> 20:31.437
Don't be ridiculous. What, because
I'm protective of him as an asset?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.511
No. The way you kissed him.

20:34.400 --> 20:37.039
- I think you've had too much to drink.
- No such thing.

20:38.160 --> 20:39.149
Oh.

20:39.320 --> 20:41.390
That's real professional.
Look at what you did.

20:41.560 --> 20:43.516
I know. That's expensive gin.

20:45.840 --> 20:46.829
Itchy ear there.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.355
So actually, it was invented
by, uh, a Hungarian baker...

20:49.520 --> 20:51.317
...to commemorate the defeat
of the Turks.

20:51.480 --> 20:53.675
And that is the true history
behind the croissant.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.229
Ha, ha.
That's just a little pastry trivia for you.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.392
You are a fountain of information,
Mr. Carmichael.

20:59.560 --> 21:00.879
- Well...
- Ha, ha.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.228
Mm?

21:15.200 --> 21:17.031
And what bands are you into?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.954
If you'd just admit I'm right,
we could move on.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.908
Anything you perceived as me
wanting him to think I like him.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.957
I assure you,
I have no feelings for Chuck.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.758
<i>He is just an asset.</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:32.512
Okay, we're back up. Can you hear us?

21:32.680 --> 21:34.671
Good night, Mr. Carmichael.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.830
Mission failed.
Black Widow's on the move.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.592
Great. You know, I hope you're happy.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.035
I told you, he's an analyst, not a spy.

21:49.080 --> 21:52.072
Way to go, Casanova. You're gonna have
the Intersect in your head forever.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.959
Okay, everybody, let's pack it up.

21:55.600 --> 21:57.909
Roan, what is the fourth prong
of the famous assault?

21:58.080 --> 22:00.230
<i>The mission's over. It's too dangerous.</i>

22:00.400 --> 22:02.630
- You're not ready for this.
- I'm ready. What is it?

22:02.800 --> 22:04.074
<i>Be a bastard.</i>

22:04.240 --> 22:05.832
<i>When you say "bastard," you mean...?</i>

22:06.000 --> 22:07.956
- I mean not you, Chuck.
- <i>All right.</i>

22:08.120 --> 22:10.998
<i>Sensitive, caring,</i>
<i>sweet, be everything you're not.</i>

22:11.160 --> 22:12.479
Be Carmichael.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.351
- Hey, missy.
- <i>Don't call her missy.</i>

22:17.520 --> 22:19.272
Yes, Mr. Carmichael?

22:19.440 --> 22:21.237
I just wanna tell you you're a fool.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.755
- Excuse me?
- No, I don't think I will.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.275
So you're heading up to your room
to get ready for bed.

22:26.440 --> 22:28.590
Floss, creams, maybe watch a little TV.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.432
Just before you drift off to sleep...

22:30.600 --> 22:32.955
...you're going to have one final,
terrifying thought.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.109
Really? What's that?

22:34.280 --> 22:37.511
That you passed up an evening
with the greatest lover you'll ever know.

22:37.680 --> 22:38.795
And who might that be?

22:38.960 --> 22:40.552
Oh, you're looking at him, sister.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.712
A man trained in the art of seduction,
who has traveled the world...

22:43.880 --> 22:45.836
...sampling women
of every culture and creed.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.355
I will offer one final time
before boarding my jet...

22:48.520 --> 22:50.795
...to an undisclosed rendezvous,
of which I am already late.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.109
Can I buy you a club soda?

22:53.280 --> 22:54.395
No, thank you.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.118
Okay, I just thought I'd ask. Good night.

22:56.280 --> 22:59.317
But you can take me up to my room
and make mad, passionate sex to me.

23:01.280 --> 23:03.191
I've still got it.

23:29.200 --> 23:31.316
Make yourself a drink, Mr. Carmichael.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.877
I'm going to slip into something...

23:35.280 --> 23:36.759
...a little bit more comfortable.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.354
Yeah, you do that. Take your time, doll.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.953
I'll just, uh, be here.

23:44.400 --> 23:45.799
Where the hell are you guys?

23:45.960 --> 23:48.713
You worked too quick, stallion.
We didn't have time to set up.

23:48.880 --> 23:51.917
It's okay, Chuck. We're on our way.
Did you flash on anything?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.389
Abort mission,
abort mission, abort mission.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.475
Gentlemen. Can you secure this area?

24:08.640 --> 24:10.949
Miss Banacheck and I
are gonna need some privacy.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.955
If the hotel room is rocking,
then we're probably having sex.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.555
Get me out of here.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.109
Don't worry. Roan Montgomery
will get you out of this.

24:20.280 --> 24:23.795
I've been in worse situations. Did I ever
tell you about the time in Thailand...

24:23.960 --> 24:26.599
...with the king's daughter
on the palace roof?

24:26.760 --> 24:29.433
No, you failed to mention it.
How do I get out of here right now?

24:29.640 --> 24:31.949
I want you to go out on the balcony.

24:35.560 --> 24:36.549
Okay, now what?

24:36.720 --> 24:39.359
I want you to take a bed sheet,
tie it around your waist...

24:39.520 --> 24:42.557
...climb up on the railing
and leap off the ledge.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.270
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not a real spy.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.429
I don't leap.

24:47.360 --> 24:48.634
Oh, there you are.

24:57.360 --> 24:58.918
It's a little chilly out there, hmm?

24:59.080 --> 25:02.356
No, not at all.
No, it's quite pleasant tonight.

25:02.520 --> 25:04.317
- Mm-hm.
- Oh.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.550
Come on. Why so shy, hmm?

25:07.040 --> 25:08.393
Well, uh, um...

25:08.560 --> 25:12.075
Uh, well, because we just kind of met
and kind of seeing someone right now.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.192
I'm going to do things to you...

25:16.360 --> 25:18.715
...you never, never,
never dreamed possible.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.440
Well, I have a very vivid imagination.

25:22.760 --> 25:23.749
Hello, Roan.

25:23.920 --> 25:26.195
You shouldn't have sent a boy
to do a man's job.

25:28.400 --> 25:29.435
Get out of there, now.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.953
No, no, wait. Why would you...?

25:31.120 --> 25:34.237
Oh, my God, that's a huge knife.
Look, you don't wanna do this.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.437
- <i>I'm a young guy.</i>
- <i>Don't beg for you life.</i>

25:37.600 --> 25:38.749
You have nothing to offer.

25:38.920 --> 25:40.876
Well, I have this.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.069
Roan, how did Thailand work again?

25:48.720 --> 25:49.789
Roan?

25:49.960 --> 25:51.109
Roan.

25:52.800 --> 25:54.472
- Wow.
- Happy anniversary, honey.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.232
- Pervert.
- No.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.958
To a night of infinite possibilities.

26:06.320 --> 26:08.072
Sorry to interrupt. Enjoy your night.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.229
Sarah, tell me you saw that.
Leaped from the balcony.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.119
Lands with a flourish.
The Russian judge gives it a 9.4.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.589
By the way,
I have a little thing called the Cipher.

26:19.760 --> 26:22.399
Yes, Mr. Carmichael. I'm very interested.

26:24.520 --> 26:27.512
There could be more.
We need to get out of here.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.914
If you ever want to see
your fellow agents alive again...

26:31.080 --> 26:32.672
...meet me tomorrow with the Cipher.

26:32.840 --> 26:34.956
<i>6th and Alameda, 10 p.m.</i>

26:35.400 --> 26:36.799
Come alone.

26:36.960 --> 26:39.838
Roan? Roan?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.113
Why are we here so late?

26:43.280 --> 26:45.874
If you're not gonna respect me, hmm...

26:46.040 --> 26:47.917
...you will fear me.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.752
May I present...

26:50.800 --> 26:53.314
...the wheel of misfortune.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.438
We had a version of one of these
in my home when I was growing up.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.635
It is very effective.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.313
Now, my pretty, pretty staff...

26:59.480 --> 27:02.472
...I shall choose one of you
to christen the wheel.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.996
Mr. Grimes.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.793
- He's not spinning.
- Uh, hold on a second, baby.

27:09.960 --> 27:11.188
- I'll spin.
- Mm-hm.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.237
I got this.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.234
It's all good, guys.

27:25.320 --> 27:26.639
Oh.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.234
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
That's just my luck.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.389
You can't fire him.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.676
Anna, it's not me.
The wheel has spoken.

27:33.840 --> 27:35.398
- It's out of my hands.
- Fine.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.796
If he's fired, I quit.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.192
- Yeah.
- That's your choice, then.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.396
- Lf Anna leaves, I have to follow my heart.
- What?

27:42.560 --> 27:44.710
I told you, you've got no shot.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.154
Jeffrey. Jeffrey, stay here.

27:46.320 --> 27:48.629
Without Jeff, this place blows.

27:48.800 --> 27:50.119
What?

27:50.280 --> 27:52.157
Okay, fine, fine. Go.

27:52.320 --> 27:53.912
Go! Who needs you?

27:54.080 --> 27:56.310
You're all fired. You're all fired.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.754
Do I have your attention now?

27:58.400 --> 28:00.960
Do I have your attention now?

28:06.240 --> 28:08.959
You know, she's going to kill them.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.032
I guess I'm just gonna have to take
my chances.

28:12.200 --> 28:15.078
But I can't save them alone.
I need your help, Roan.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.755
They knew what they were getting into.
That's the game we play.

28:20.080 --> 28:24.790
If you show up, there will be
three dead agents instead of just two.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.713
What, so that's it?

28:26.880 --> 28:29.314
What happened to being
the world's greatest spy?

28:29.760 --> 28:31.671
That was a long time ago.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.551
Roan Montgomery
is not the man you see before you.

28:39.680 --> 28:44.310
My life may be boring and cowardly,
but I'm alive.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.710
That's more than most
in my line of work can claim.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.313
But you're a legend, Roan.

28:48.480 --> 28:50.072
Don't you understand that?

28:50.240 --> 28:52.834
So how can you just sit there
and watch them die?

28:53.320 --> 28:56.995
Because I'm not in love
with one of the agents.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.438
I'm not...

29:00.320 --> 29:04.074
I care about them.
I care about both of them.

29:04.240 --> 29:07.596
Besides, we heard what she said, okay?
To her, I'm just an asset.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.352
No, you're not.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.549
Trust me.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.030
The lady doth protest too much.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.277
But, Charles, you have to ask yourself...

29:20.040 --> 29:22.554
...is she worth dying for?

29:26.960 --> 29:28.473
Yes.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.233
Poor boy.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.878
Lesson number one on being a spy:

29:36.040 --> 29:39.828
Never fall in love.

29:40.840 --> 29:43.308
Well, then I guess
I'm not much of a spy.

29:44.800 --> 29:46.870
And you're not much of a legend.

29:49.840 --> 29:51.990
Listen to me.
I'm trying to reach General Beckman.

29:52.160 --> 29:53.957
My name is Chuck Bartowski.

29:54.120 --> 29:56.031
I'm not listed? Look, I'm a spy, all right?

29:56.200 --> 29:57.918
Try my alias, Charles Carmichael.

29:58.080 --> 30:01.868
I'm trying to contact General Beckman.
I need to speak with her before tonight.

30:02.320 --> 30:05.471
Have General Beckman call me as soon
as possible, all right? It's an emergency.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.634
Morning.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.518
Oh, hey, Chuck.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.114
- What's going on?
- Some trouble on the home front.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.192
I totally screwed up.
Went to Morgan for romance advice.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.316
Yeah, that's, uh,
that's never a great policy.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.153
No. I've gotta do something
to make this up to your sis.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.676
- What are you thinking about doing?
- What I should've done last night.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.512
Cover this place in rose petals...

30:28.680 --> 30:32.036
...roaring fire,
simple candlelit dinner, pecan pie.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.792
Maybe give her a foot massage
in the tub.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.190
That's a natural place, I think,
to stop giving me details.

30:36.360 --> 30:39.079
- So why don't you?
- Well, when, you know?

30:39.240 --> 30:42.869
I've gotta be at work in, like, 20 minutes.
Got a 5 a.m. Call tomorrow.

30:43.040 --> 30:45.554
I'll do it. I just hope I'm not too late.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.998
- Charles.
- Where is everybody?

30:57.160 --> 30:58.878
- Oh, you mean your coworkers?
- Sure.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.713
We had a little disagreement.
Some things needed to be done.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.552
I fired the majority of the staff.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.274
- You what?
- Mm-hm.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.949
I'm dead. When Big Mike gets here,
there's no one in the store.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.599
He's gonna fire me. Help me, man.

31:10.760 --> 31:12.352
- How?
- Ask them to come back to work.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.829
- Why don't you ask them?
- Then they won't fear me.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.752
Michael. So nice to see you, sir.

31:16.920 --> 31:18.194
Gentlemen.

31:19.520 --> 31:21.829
- Something amiss, Patel?
- Um, Morgan's on an errand.

31:22.000 --> 31:23.877
- Anna's in the stockroom.
- I mean your vest.

31:24.040 --> 31:26.235
Oh, yeah. It's in my locker.
I was gonna change right now.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.994
- And the managers-only doughnuts?
- They're on your desk, sir.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.835
Tight ship you're running, Patel.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.399
Gentlemen.

31:36.640 --> 31:37.834
Maybe he won't ever notice.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.355
Depends on how long it takes him
to eat a box of doughnuts.

31:40.520 --> 31:41.509
Oh, yeah.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.069
Thank you for coming.

31:43.240 --> 31:49.475
What I didn't mention last night was
that everybody gets one practice spin.

31:49.640 --> 31:53.110
So in all fairness, I gotta give
Morgan here another shot, okay?

31:53.280 --> 31:54.872
Here we go. Come on now.

31:55.040 --> 31:56.314
No one is spinning the wheel.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.313
You want us back, you're gonna have
to make some changes around here.

31:59.480 --> 32:00.515
Uh-huh.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.228
Okay, okay. Ha, ha.

32:04.400 --> 32:07.870
Labor negotiations are part
of the process. Thoughts, musings?

32:08.040 --> 32:09.951
- We want two-hour lunch breaks.
- No way.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.838
Okay, okay, okay.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.230
Okay, you got it.
You drive a hard bargain.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.197
- Ha, ha, what else?
- Unlimited bathroom time...

32:16.360 --> 32:18.715
...for both resting and relaxation.

32:18.880 --> 32:21.348
- Mm, done.
- And you spin the wheel.

32:24.560 --> 32:27.154
Anna, Anna,
I don't think that's necessary.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.278
We were doing well here.
I don't think that I...

32:30.440 --> 32:32.590
Live by the sword, die by the sword.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.910
Ha, ha.
You don't even know what that means.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.472
Yeah, diaper-station duty.

32:44.640 --> 32:46.358
Baby needs wipe. Baby needs wipe.

32:48.320 --> 32:49.309
Nice. Nicely done.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.479
- You can go and bring that to the front.
- Oh, thank you.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.312
Mr. Bartowski.

33:08.800 --> 33:10.518
Lovely cover they've got you working.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.828
Perhaps you would like to elaborate on
what you meant last night by "legend.<i>"</i>

33:15.000 --> 33:17.560
I meant what I said.
You were great once.

33:18.200 --> 33:19.872
Are you here to help or just browsing?

33:20.040 --> 33:22.713
I suppose that depends
on what your plan is for tonight.

33:22.880 --> 33:24.791
My plan is to show up
at the meeting spot...

33:24.960 --> 33:27.349
...and exchange the Cipher
for Casey and Sarah.

33:28.120 --> 33:30.429
You're determined to risk your life
for these people?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.477
- They'd do it for me.
- We should revise your plan.

33:32.640 --> 33:35.154
Come up with something
that doesn't get us all killed.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.435
I'm open to that.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.191
I have a package for Sasha Banacheck.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.638
You need to sign.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.149
Hello?

34:04.320 --> 34:06.276
<i>Here's how this is gonna go down.</i>

34:06.440 --> 34:07.919
<i>Want the Cipher, you play by my rules.</i>

34:08.080 --> 34:11.755
Meet me at 9000 Burbank Boulevard
and bring the hostages.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.309
It's her.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.038
Answer it.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.473
Hello?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.467
Oh, sorry, yeah.
You're just gonna wanna take the 5 north.

34:24.639 --> 34:25.868
That's probably the easiest.

34:26.040 --> 34:28.190
Burbank Boulevard exit.
Make a left at the light.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.032
Sorry. You can find it.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.678
<i>Greetings.</i>

34:48.280 --> 34:50.110
<i>I see you found your way.</i>

34:52.960 --> 34:55.268
<i>Hope traffic wasn't too bad.</i>

34:56.480 --> 34:59.278
<i>As you can see, I have the Cipher.</i>

34:59.440 --> 35:02.796
<i>Once my friends are safely out of</i>
<i>the store, I'll tell you where to find it.</i>

35:02.960 --> 35:06.509
<i>It's been a pleasure working with you.</i>
<i>I wish you luck in your future endeavors.</i>

35:06.680 --> 35:09.069
<i>Remember, we'll always have Paris.</i>

35:13.080 --> 35:14.559
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:19.360 --> 35:20.793
Oh. Oh.

35:39.120 --> 35:43.432
Well, now that your savior
is trapped with the Cipher...

35:43.600 --> 35:44.953
...I no longer need hostages.

35:45.120 --> 35:48.635
- So goodbye.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

35:50.280 --> 35:52.191
- Roan.
- Hello, Sasha.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.999
I should have killed you years ago.

35:55.160 --> 35:57.958
Yes, probably.
Would you please drop your guns?

35:58.120 --> 36:01.157
- Who the hell is that?
- That is Roan Montgomery.

36:08.440 --> 36:09.475
Stand back, Roan.

36:11.080 --> 36:12.957
Or I'll kill her.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.269
No, no, no.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.870
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- I'm on the roof.

36:17.040 --> 36:20.828
- Charles, remember Thailand?
- This is not time for one of your stories.

36:21.400 --> 36:24.676
- Remember Thailand.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:24.840 --> 36:27.195
You were on the palace roof
and you tied a bed sheet...

36:27.360 --> 36:28.713
No, no, no.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.637
Charles, it's time to be a spy.

36:31.800 --> 36:32.915
I'm not. I'm not a spy.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.156
Bring me the Cipher right now
or I'll kill her.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.716
I guess you gotta die sometime.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.598
It'd just be nice if it wasn't today.

36:57.080 --> 36:59.548
Sarah!

37:03.080 --> 37:04.149
Chuck.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.677
Chuck. Are you okay?

37:06.840 --> 37:08.956
I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?

37:09.120 --> 37:10.553
I'm fine.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.674
Now that's what I call a spy.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.311
I ain't new.

37:32.480 --> 37:34.471
<i>Excellent work, team. Thanks.</i>

37:34.640 --> 37:35.629
<i>We have the Cipher.</i>

37:35.800 --> 37:38.030
General, Chuck was invaluable
on this mission.

37:38.200 --> 37:40.839
He also risked his life
several times to save ours.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.156
<i>Your country thanks you, Chuck.</i>

37:43.320 --> 37:47.074
<i>Hopefully, we can rebuild the Intersect</i>
<i>and this nightmare can be over for you.</i>

37:47.240 --> 37:48.389
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

37:48.560 --> 37:52.314
Wait. Actually, while I appreciate
all of your kind words...

37:52.480 --> 37:55.074
...if we're going to continue
to coexist happily...

37:55.240 --> 37:58.516
...I think that the government needs
to start pulling their weight around here.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.477
<i>What did you have in mind, Chuck?</i>

38:00.640 --> 38:02.392
<i>Ellie, I just wanna apologize again.</i>

38:02.560 --> 38:04.437
I know I may seem like Mr. Smooth...

38:04.600 --> 38:08.070
...but the truth is,
I don't have a million moves.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.673
All I know is I love you.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.512
I don't need moves, Devon.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.478
Just the fact that you're trying
is enough.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.079
Is that pecan pie?

38:31.560 --> 38:34.393
I can't believe I fell for that. You're the
sweetest man in the whole world.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.197
No biggie, babe.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.230
Well, be sure and thank the CIA for me.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.799
Our pleasure.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.269
I suppose I should thank you
for saving my life.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.273
Oh, you've done it for me a time or two.
I'm probably still in debt.

38:50.440 --> 38:52.829
I have to admit,
that was pretty impressive.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.797
Right? I mean, come on.

38:54.960 --> 38:56.678
I know I'm just an asset.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.592
But between the two of us...

38:58.760 --> 39:01.672
...I mean, have you ever seen anyone
do something like that before?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.398
I think it's safe to say, Chuck...

39:03.560 --> 39:05.676
...that I've never seen
anyone quite like you.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.518
Well, Agent Casey,
thanks for the accommodations.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.954
Agent Montgomery.

39:11.120 --> 39:12.519
The reason I failed you twice...

39:12.680 --> 39:16.639
...was that your partner at the time
was too pretty to pass.

39:16.800 --> 39:18.836
Should have failed her a few more times.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.718
Should have known.

39:25.080 --> 39:27.355
Adieu, Agent Walker.

39:27.520 --> 39:29.636
It was a real pleasure,
Agent Montgomery.

39:30.240 --> 39:33.038
Well, I'll, um... I'll see you later, Chuck.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.468
Ah.

39:36.800 --> 39:38.313
Let her go.

39:39.280 --> 39:42.955
A great man once said it will give her
the illusion of being pursued.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.190
- You trust me?
- Yeah.

39:47.360 --> 39:48.952
Good. Do you own a white dinner jacket?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.235
- No.
- Rent one.

39:50.400 --> 39:53.039
Tonight you will show up
with a bottle of Château Margaux...

39:53.200 --> 39:55.919
...the dinner jacket
and a single red rose...

39:56.080 --> 39:59.231
...known in several countries
as the Montgomery.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.551
- Goodbye, Charles.
- Goodbye, Roan.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.829
Hello, Diane.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.798
Yeah, on my way to the airport.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.871
Should be in Dallas by the morning.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.589
Chuck.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.878
Hi.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.197
- Um...
- Hello, Chuck.

40:45.640 --> 40:47.437
- Bryce?
- Miss me?
