WEBVTT

00:03.640 --> 00:05.039
Now what?

00:06.840 --> 00:10.839
I'd just like to run through it
one more time, if I may.

00:13.840 --> 00:15.759
Who is this?

00:17.960 --> 00:19.679
That's John.

00:20.880 --> 00:22.999
- John...?
- Luther.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.479
And who is John Luther?

00:28.600 --> 00:30.079
My friend.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.679
How did you and John meet?

00:37.160 --> 00:40.399
When I was suspected
of killing my parents.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.359
And, after that, you became friends?

00:43.480 --> 00:44.919
We grew close.

00:45.040 --> 00:49.879
And how exactly would you
characterise this closeness?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.239
Well, we were...

00:52.360 --> 00:53.519
simpatico.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.039
And I pitied him.

00:56.160 --> 00:57.319
How so?

00:59.400 --> 01:01.319
He always seemed lost to me.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.358
Paddling furiously, just to keep afloat.

01:06.920 --> 01:09.639
I wanted to help him.

01:09.760 --> 01:13.319
And what form did this help take?

01:13.440 --> 01:14.919
Well, John had any number

01:15.040 --> 01:17.799
of vexations, and I helped him
in several ways.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.479
Tell me about Ian Reed.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.279
He was a friend

01:24.400 --> 01:26.279
who betrayed John
and hurt him very badly.

01:26.400 --> 01:28.519
So I killed him.

01:28.640 --> 01:30.959
Two barrels of his own shotgun.

01:32.200 --> 01:33.239
Boom, boom.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.439
And did John...?

01:40.440 --> 01:43.119
And this is very important, Alice.

01:43.240 --> 01:46.559
Did John ask you to do this?

01:49.800 --> 01:51.039
Good heavens, no.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.399
He was absolutely livid.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.679
We had quite a tiff.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.479
Things were said.

for my misdeeds...

02:21.840 --> 02:25.199
- ...are you?
- No, Miss Morgan.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.679
Is he still a police officer?

02:30.080 --> 02:32.359
Yes, he's one of ours.

Better.

03:43.320 --> 03:44.519
Mostly.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.039
What about you?

03:48.160 --> 03:49.959
Ah, a bit better.

03:51.120 --> 03:52.279
Mostly.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.999
I'm going back to work.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.399
Are you ready?

05:41.960 --> 05:45.839
Attempted burglary, resisting arrest,
assaulting a police officer.

05:47.120 --> 05:51.119
What's your name?

05:52.200 --> 05:55.479
- He tried to rob a house in this state?
- Not a house, a dojo.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.639
He tried to rob a karate school?

05:59.960 --> 06:01.439
Right, let's get him interviewed.

06:01.560 --> 06:04.319
We thank you for your custom. We know
other police stations are available.

06:04.440 --> 06:06.719
The thing they don't
tell you about the drugs

06:06.840 --> 06:08.799
is that it makes you smell
like a dog's arse.

06:08.920 --> 06:13.119
It's not very Keith Richards, is it?
Not very rock'n'roll.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.679
Justin.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.759
I've never seen you in your uniform.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.279
Look like you're on work experience.

06:22.400 --> 06:25.679
Yeah, well,
my good uniform got vomited on.

06:25.800 --> 06:30.759
It's all very soul-destroying, isn't it?
Actual police work.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.559
- Burglars, junkies.
- Well, I'm working off my sins, aren't I?

06:34.680 --> 06:37.439
Your major sin being
that you, er, were loyal to me.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.879
That'll be the one.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.239
So, what, you're in here
because you picked up a shoplifter?

06:43.360 --> 06:45.519
They set up a new unit.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.399
Serious and Serial.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.879
You not fancy staying in Cold Case?
Revealing the identity of Jack The Ripper.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.999
Let's just see if you're going to be
as cheeky as that

06:55.120 --> 06:57.519
when you have to pick me up
at 8.00 in the morning.

06:57.640 --> 07:00.399
Cos at 8.00 in the morning, I am grizzly.

07:01.720 --> 07:05.559
I was told I'd be in uniform
for two years, minimum.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.639
Tried to make you resign, didn't they?

07:08.680 --> 07:11.599
Humiliated you. Bullied you.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.919
You're a bit of an embarrassment.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.239
But you didn't leave.

07:17.360 --> 07:19.239
No... No, you didn't.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.879
See you in the morning.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.399
See you in the morning.

07:45.880 --> 07:46.879
Justin.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.519
DS Ripley. Morning.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.079
Excuse me.

08:10.160 --> 08:11.079
Martin.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.719
- Or is it Guv'nor?
- Whichever you prefer.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.959
Sergeant Ripley.
My old comrade-in-arms.

08:18.080 --> 08:20.159
- Good to see you back where you belong.
- Sir.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.279
I fancy DCI Luther forgot to tell you
I'm heading up this unit.

08:23.400 --> 08:26.079
Er, he may have omitted that detail,
sir, yes.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.239
Blitz attack, last night.

08:28.360 --> 08:30.319
The victim is Sadie Buckingham.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.159
Schenk.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.318
I'm listening.

08:33.440 --> 08:37.359
She was strangled...and...

08:37.480 --> 08:41.198
Throat slashed.
From right to left, very sharp blade.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.639
Do you think he's having a joke?

08:45.760 --> 08:47.959
- What do you think?
- What kind of joke?

08:48.080 --> 08:52.599
Well...slaughtered like cattle,
right next to a meat market.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.319
Let's have a look at him.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.119
Mr Punch.

09:20.840 --> 09:23.079
- Welcome on board, sir.
- Cheers.

09:25.120 --> 09:27.399
Good to see you, sir.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.479
- Morning.
- Sir.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.399
- Sir.
- Morning, all.

09:34.520 --> 09:36.399
Morning, Guv.

09:36.520 --> 09:37.439
DS Gray.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.759
- Oh, er, DS Ripley. Justin.
- Nice to meet you.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.679
Benny, can you play back
those phone calls?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.439
The victim first managed to dial 999...

10:01.960 --> 10:03.119
All right.

10:03.240 --> 10:07.479
...after which, the killer made this call
to the victim's mother.

10:07.600 --> 10:10.999
He is the sunrise. He loves everyone.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.199
He then called several of her contacts,

10:14.320 --> 10:18.039
her sisters, her friends,
her colleagues, her vet!

10:18.160 --> 10:21.599
He...is...the sunrise.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.559
He...loves...everyone.

10:26.760 --> 10:30.119
All right. First thing we need to do,
Justin, is run background

10:30.240 --> 10:32.559
on the victim's friends, acquaintances.
Make sure this isn't

10:32.680 --> 10:34.399
an ex-boyfriend that's gone nuts. Erin...

10:34.520 --> 10:37.919
I'll source the sunrise chant, see if
it ties in with a specific belief system.

10:38.040 --> 10:42.439
Good place to start, but this...
...this isn't a cult murder.

10:42.560 --> 10:43.439
Guv?

10:43.560 --> 10:47.119
All of this is for effect.
Murder by theatre.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.959
And I bet the same goes for,
"I am the sun that shines."

10:50.080 --> 10:51.079
It's designed to give him

10:51.200 --> 10:52.919
- some sort of prestige.
- Yeah, like people are already

10:53.040 --> 10:53.799
talking about him.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.319
That's right, and if he's
that desperate to be noticed,

10:56.440 --> 10:57.479
then this was opening night.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.639
There'll be a lot more
where this comes from.

10:59.760 --> 11:02.759
I'll source the chant and the mask,
I'll check websites, collectors.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.119
- See who's buying, who's selling.
- All right.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.799
How's this looking?

11:10.920 --> 11:13.359
It's early doors. We'll get him.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.639
Yeah.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.319
John, I, um...

11:19.960 --> 11:22.159
...I know you had great loyalty
to Rose Teller,

11:22.280 --> 11:24.679
and rightly so,

11:24.800 --> 11:28.039
but often it's the good coppers
who shoulder the blame for the bad.

11:29.040 --> 11:31.479
Things between us...

11:31.600 --> 11:34.599
historically,
have sometimes been...

11:34.720 --> 11:36.559
You had a job to do.

11:37.680 --> 11:38.839
You did it well.

11:41.480 --> 11:43.359
If I was your adversary then...

11:44.520 --> 11:46.039
...I'm not your adversary now.

11:47.760 --> 11:51.759
I have a new job to do,
and part of that job is to police you,

11:51.880 --> 11:54.359
and to do that properly,

11:54.480 --> 11:57.639
I need your trust...and your candour.

11:58.920 --> 12:01.359
No secrets.

12:01.480 --> 12:03.319
No agendas.

12:03.440 --> 12:05.679
And no Alice Morgan.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.919
No secrets.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.639
No agendas.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.839
So, what was it like
being bumped back to uniform?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.919
I was never ashamed to wear a uniform.

12:19.040 --> 12:22.119
What about working for
His Satanic Majesty?

12:23.560 --> 12:25.319
- Sorry, who?
- Luther.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.999
Is he really as dirty as they say?

12:27.120 --> 12:28.519
Who?

12:29.520 --> 12:30.439
They!

12:30.560 --> 12:32.199
All the people
who've never worked with him?

12:32.320 --> 12:33.959
Look, I'm just saying,
you know the pitfalls,

12:34.080 --> 12:35.319
you can tell me what to look out for.

12:35.440 --> 12:36.519
Where are we, Justin?

12:36.640 --> 12:39.119
Er, nothing of interest, so far.

12:39.240 --> 12:41.319
She's got an ex-boyfriend,
was done for affray,

12:41.440 --> 12:43.359
but that was back during the G7 riots.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.519
No restraining orders.
No, nothing, really.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.919
All right, what about the sunrise stuff?

12:48.040 --> 12:49.839
You were right. No specific reference.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.839
Sunrise imagery seems general
to just about every religion or cult.

12:52.960 --> 12:53.959
What about the mask?

12:54.080 --> 12:56.039
It looks antique, maybe theatrical.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.999
If that's the case,
there's a market for it, which is good.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.919
Problem is the internet. Collectables flow
back and forth over international borders,

13:03.040 --> 13:05.399
barely leave a trace, so right now
I'm hitting the talk boards,

13:05.520 --> 13:06.919
see if anybody there can ID it for us.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.959
- Well, stick with it, see what comes up.
- OK.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.359
Guv!

13:12.640 --> 13:14.799
DCI Luther.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.119
Caroline.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.839
Um, DS Ripley.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.519
- Caroline Jones.
- Caroline, now's not a good time for me.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.959
It's all right, boss.
We can give you a minute.

13:24.080 --> 13:28.519
How long have you and DCI Luther
known one another?

13:28.640 --> 13:30.519
Since my husband accidentally
killed a prostitute.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.359
How is she?

13:34.960 --> 13:37.199
She was self-mutilating at 14.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.399
She cut herself with a razor.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.839
Top of the arms, top of the thighs.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.639
Places I couldn't see.

13:49.680 --> 13:52.239
Before you know,
she's stealing from me.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.679
Lying.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.999
Threatening me with a knife.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.919
And she just runs away.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.799
- Gone.
- Caroline...

14:08.080 --> 14:11.199
OK, listen, I'm gonna stop you here,
cos what...what you're gonna tell me...

14:12.760 --> 14:13.839
...I can't help.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.919
- She was selling herself at 17.
- I might not like it,

14:16.040 --> 14:17.599
you might not like it, but...

14:18.760 --> 14:21.279
Well, Jenny's made her choices.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.239
You ever hear of necro-porn?

14:33.880 --> 14:36.559
This is what they're going to do to Jenny.
This afternoon.

14:36.680 --> 14:39.879
Explain to me how this isn't rape.

14:40.000 --> 14:43.559
Men who do this aren't actors.
They pay for it.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.519
Do you understand what that means?

14:46.640 --> 14:49.999
Men are paying to rape my daughter.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.239
So many times, I've tried to help people

14:52.360 --> 14:54.959
by doing things I shouldn't have done,
and...

14:56.000 --> 14:58.239
...it's only made it worse.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.759
You think?

15:01.280 --> 15:03.839
You didn't need to treat her dad
the way you did.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.039
Degrading him in public, humiliating him.

15:06.160 --> 15:08.599
It was the only way
I knew how to stop him.

15:08.720 --> 15:10.439
What you did to me,

15:10.560 --> 15:11.879
to her dad...

15:14.600 --> 15:15.639
...it messed her up.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.759
So this is your fault.

15:19.480 --> 15:22.439
As much as her dad's, this is your fault.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.479
- For what you did to us.
- I'm a policeman.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.639
What did you want me to do?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.239
And your wife?

15:34.040 --> 15:35.799
Is she proud?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.439
All right, I'll talk to her.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.319
Can't promise I'll change her mind.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.599
Have you got an address?

15:56.880 --> 15:59.199
No... This is all I've got.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.079
All right.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.839
No jokes, OK?

16:08.960 --> 16:11.679
There's no joking about
this sort of thing.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.159
Is that wee girl OK?

16:15.280 --> 16:17.199
She is now, apparently.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.719
But, Benny, I need to find her today
or that is gonna happen to her, or worse.

16:22.840 --> 16:23.799
You've worked vice.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.039
Any laws you have to break
to help me do that?

16:28.920 --> 16:31.759
Well, people like this like to keep
a low profile, for obvious reasons.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.239
But if there's a revenue stream,
there's a paper trail.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.959
So I'll make a few phone calls,
see what I can dig out for you.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.919
All right. Just let me know
as soon as you know anything, all right?

16:42.040 --> 16:43.159
No problem.

17:08.520 --> 17:09.959
Excuse me.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.679
Are you an art student?

17:11.800 --> 17:15.598
- Am I that obvious?
- No, no, no.

17:15.720 --> 17:18.199
- Where do you go?
- Um, Saint Martin's.

17:18.319 --> 17:20.878
No?!

17:21.000 --> 17:23.199
- Me too. I went to Saint Martin's.
- Really?

17:23.319 --> 17:27.279
- Yeah. It's a small world, or what?
- Yeah...

17:27.400 --> 17:30.959
What are you doing?
Um... Fine art...or...?

17:31.080 --> 17:33.079
- No, textiles.
- Oh!

17:33.200 --> 17:36.879
Yeah, we have to, um, design a print
that somehow evokes London.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.119
Oh, well...

17:39.040 --> 17:41.039
...you came to the right place
for that, eh?

17:41.160 --> 17:44.559
I mean, this, this is...is...London.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.239
It used to be a quiet little lane,
lined with elm trees and so on,

17:49.360 --> 17:52.039
but they've been selling stuff here
since 1608.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.319
Then in the 17th century,
the Huguenots arrived.

17:54.440 --> 17:58.199
18th century, it becomes,
like, a centre for cloth-making,

17:58.320 --> 18:00.639
and then in 1830,
they tried to change the name.

18:00.760 --> 18:05.079
"Petticoat" was considered too raunchy
for the Victorians. But it didn't work!

18:05.200 --> 18:08.959
- Petticoat Lane endures.
- Are you, like, a local historian?

18:09.080 --> 18:12.519
No, no, no, no. I just...I love the place.
You can feel the time,

18:12.640 --> 18:16.559
like layers of time, strata of time,
a big cake of time.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.919
No, it's magic. It's got magic to it.

18:18.960 --> 18:19.919
Hey...

18:21.320 --> 18:23.399
...do you wanna see something really cool?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.439
No. Um, no, I'm fine, thanks.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.519
- The most London thing ever.
- No.

18:28.640 --> 18:29.999
Single most London thing you'll ever see.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.599
Honestly, I'm fine! Thank you.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.439
He is the sunrise. He loves everyone.

19:08.560 --> 19:11.359
He is the sunrise, he loves everyone.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.239
He is the sunrise.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.559
He loves everyone.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.159
Smithfields. Petticoat Lane.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.039
He's a London boy, ain't he?

19:28.080 --> 19:30.639
We know he likes the attention, so, er...

19:30.760 --> 19:34.279
Do me a favour, confiscate every one
of those mobile phones.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.959
- On what grounds, legally?
- Find grounds.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.439
All right?
We need to start collecting data

19:40.560 --> 19:43.039
on all the crowds that show up
at the crime scenes.

19:43.160 --> 19:46.119
Comparing faces, see if the same face
doesn't show up more than once.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.399
Sometimes serial offenders return to
the scene, enjoy the chaos they've caused.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.439
- Makes them feel omnipotent.
- Yeah, I know, it's just...

19:52.560 --> 19:55.399
When he says "confiscate", what he means
is appeal to the owners of the phones,

19:55.520 --> 19:57.319
- OK?
- Fine,

19:57.440 --> 19:58.519
but that's not what he said, is it?

19:58.520 --> 19:58.679
But that's not what he said, is it?

19:58.800 --> 20:03.359
...Seen something, I'd like you to speak
to my detectives. Anyone else,

20:03.480 --> 20:08.399
can you just give us a little room,
please, er, so we can work? All right?

20:08.520 --> 20:10.439
You can go home, if you can, please.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.359
Move back and make some space.

20:13.480 --> 20:15.079
Can you move back, everyone, please?

20:15.200 --> 20:17.359
- No more photos.
- Give us some space, thank you.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.479
Excuse me.

20:49.120 --> 20:53.359
Message for DS Ripley. Chasing suspect,
Northbirch Estate, south side.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.759
Thin, IC1, brown hair. Hurry up.

21:09.720 --> 21:10.719
Where?

23:29.960 --> 23:32.279
Aargh!

23:34.680 --> 23:37.079
Don't ruin it!

23:39.040 --> 23:40.039
Aaargh!

23:41.720 --> 23:43.479
Aaargh!

23:53.360 --> 23:54.479
Boss?

23:57.120 --> 23:59.799
- Go, go, go. Check it outside.
- Through there.

23:59.920 --> 24:02.199
- What-what do you want?
- Oh!

24:02.320 --> 24:04.159
Evidence bag.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.439
He must be coming your way.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.719
- Here. In here.
- Yeah, DNA.

24:22.040 --> 24:25.519
Helicopter's after him.
Uniform, dogs, the lot, but he got away.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.999
- Yeah. He's fast.
- He's more than fast.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.279
- Had a getaway route scouted out.
- Bet he did.

24:32.920 --> 24:33.839
DNA?

24:33.960 --> 24:37.199
It's been expedited,
imminent danger to life and so on.

24:37.320 --> 24:40.079
Can you even see anything?

24:40.200 --> 24:45.479
Cheers, mate. Um, listen, call me as soon
as that DNA result comes in, all right?

24:45.600 --> 24:46.759
Where are you going?

24:46.880 --> 24:48.439
To hospital.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.039
Do you have permission to be here, sir?

25:17.160 --> 25:18.159
Thank you.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.479
Alice.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.919
What's this?

25:46.360 --> 25:49.199
Permanent solution
to a temporary problem.

25:49.320 --> 25:53.079
- How many times have you tried it?
- Fewer than a hundred.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.839
Sadly, each attempt ended in failure.

25:55.960 --> 26:00.119
So they gave me no choice,
but just to...  ...keep on living.

26:00.240 --> 26:04.359
And to keep you safe,
they put you in here.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.839
Well, it is a secure hospital, John.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.759
As secure as a prison?

26:09.880 --> 26:12.199
One can only assume so.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.559
Are you seeing anyone?

26:14.680 --> 26:17.999
- None of your business.
- Because I'm not.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.639
Most of the people in here are women.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.359
Not that I mind, per se.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.799
Needs must.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.959
But they do tend to veer
on the mentally ill.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.519
Child abuse, spouse abuse, alcohol abuse.

26:31.640 --> 26:35.479
It's all just breathtakingly unerotic.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.279
What about you?

26:37.400 --> 26:39.359
- What about me?
- Have you left yet?

26:39.480 --> 26:41.039
- Left where?
- Police force.

26:41.160 --> 26:42.439
No.

26:43.440 --> 26:44.719
Will you?

26:48.600 --> 26:50.359
Yeah.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.359
Yeah, I'm leaving.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.319
- When?
- Soon.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.999
Just got a couple of things
to take care of.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.239
Getting Ripley back on track.

27:00.960 --> 27:02.199
And there's this girl...

27:02.320 --> 27:03.919
- What girl?
- Just...

27:04.040 --> 27:05.639
a girl.

27:05.760 --> 27:10.039
- I said I'd help.
- Which is exactly the problem.

27:11.680 --> 27:12.959
Yeah.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.479
But then I'm done.

27:14.600 --> 27:16.799
Good, because the people around you
are vampires.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.199
They'll suck your veins dry,

27:19.320 --> 27:22.359
crack open your bones
and lick out the marrow.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.199
You've done enough for them,
so step away

27:26.320 --> 27:28.639
and find yourself a life worth living.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.479
Well, that's the plan, anyway.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.679
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.759
- I always wanted to see somewhere hot.
- Mm.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.319
I've never seen the desert.
Perhaps see some sharks.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.999
Oh, I'm a great fan of sharks.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.479
Daddy took me snorkelling once
for my birthday,

27:50.600 --> 27:52.479
to see them in their natural habitat.

27:52.600 --> 27:53.599
Did you see many?

27:53.720 --> 27:56.439
Enough to realise
I prefer them in aquariums.

27:58.560 --> 28:01.839
I've always wanted to go and see
the Very Large Array in New Mexico.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.239
It's not the biggest in the world,
of course,

28:04.360 --> 28:07.719
or the most modern, but it is iconic,
and I grew up wanting to see it.

28:11.400 --> 28:13.399
It's quite spectacular.

28:13.520 --> 28:15.559
Out there in the desert.

28:19.200 --> 28:21.199
We could go together.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.039
Want some?

28:41.160 --> 28:42.479
Mm-mm.

28:47.320 --> 28:48.439
I've gotta go.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.279
Madmen to catch.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.999
Need any advice?

28:55.120 --> 28:56.799
No.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.919
Pretty up to speed with my...lunatics.

29:01.040 --> 29:02.679
Well...

29:04.920 --> 29:06.759
...don't be a stranger.

30:31.400 --> 30:32.559
Benny?

30:33.600 --> 30:38.759
The death porn is produced by a foreign
registered offshoot of Hemina Films.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.319
It's run out of Mile End.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.919
So, bad news - for obvious reasons
it's all kept a bit "entre nous".

30:44.040 --> 30:45.879
Good news - that means they have to draw
from a very small pool of technicians

30:45.880 --> 30:48.119
Good news - that means they have to draw
from a very small pool of technicians

30:48.240 --> 30:50.919
- and locations.
- So have you got an address?

30:51.040 --> 30:52.599
Give me an hour.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.079
- DS Gray, I've been thinking...
- Yeah?

30:58.200 --> 31:00.199
He said to me, "Don't ruin it."

31:01.840 --> 31:03.199
"Don't ruin it."

31:04.280 --> 31:05.799
What does that say to you?

31:05.920 --> 31:09.359
- That he's on a mission?
- Yeah, but what is that mission?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.599
Celebrity. Infamy.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.799
No, it's more than that, isn't it?

31:13.920 --> 31:15.879
Something else
he's trying to achieve.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.239
- Um, have you got that file for the...?
- Guv.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.239
Can I have a word? Sort of...

31:26.360 --> 31:29.039
- off the record, type thing?
- Yeah, of course.

31:32.960 --> 31:33.959
Oh!

31:34.080 --> 31:37.159
Um...I'm guessing
you've read my personal file?

31:39.440 --> 31:44.319
So...you know how hard
I have worked to get here.

31:44.440 --> 31:47.159
Now, my point is, and please
don't take this the wrong way...

31:47.280 --> 31:48.199
Promise to try.

31:48.320 --> 31:52.359
...but today you asked me
to confiscate people's mobile phones

31:52.480 --> 31:53.799
when there was no actual...

31:53.920 --> 31:55.519
- Gray, Gray.
- ...no real legal grounds.

31:55.640 --> 31:59.319
- Gray, it was a figure of speech.
- Yeah, I know, I get that...really.

31:59.440 --> 32:03.919
It's just...well, if I had just
confiscated them, would you have minded?

32:04.040 --> 32:05.559
Honestly, no.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.519
But I would have protected you
from any circumstances.

32:12.560 --> 32:16.479
That's my point. I don't want to
have to need that kind of protection.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.959
With the best will in the world,
I don't want to end up like DS Ripley.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.879
He was like this rising star.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.679
- And now, he's...
- He's what?

32:23.800 --> 32:26.199
- Well...
- What?

32:26.320 --> 32:28.119
Tarnished...sort of.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.319
- Tarnished?
- Sorry. Um...

32:30.440 --> 32:33.799
I don't want to risk my career
when it's only just getting started.

32:35.880 --> 32:37.039
It's just...

32:38.160 --> 32:40.479
...this is my job, you know?

32:43.080 --> 32:44.319
Noted.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.559
- Benny, have you got that address?
- Surely do.

32:52.680 --> 32:55.399
- Question is, do you want it?
- Give it to me.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.519
Can I help you?

33:18.640 --> 33:21.159
Yeah. You can shut up.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.159
Who are you?

33:40.200 --> 33:45.479
So what you're telling me is your mum
has no right to be worried about you. Hmm.

33:45.600 --> 33:46.999
Listen, Officer Whoever,

33:47.120 --> 33:51.199
I see stuff you wouldn't even believe,
so best not patronise me, eh?

33:51.320 --> 33:52.319
Of course.

33:53.480 --> 33:54.759
Of course.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.759
I don't mean to.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.719
Anyway, it's just sex.

33:59.840 --> 34:02.199
Letting someone have sex with you
while you're unconscious,

34:02.320 --> 34:04.239
that's not sex only, is it?

34:04.360 --> 34:06.439
I'm a sex worker.

34:06.560 --> 34:09.438
So, yeah, I do some funny things,
but at least I'm my own boss.

34:09.560 --> 34:11.079
I don't have to believe a load of bullshit

34:11.199 --> 34:12.918
that people shove
down each others' throats

34:13.040 --> 34:15.958
about love and marriage and monogamy,
blah, blah, blah.

34:16.080 --> 34:17.799
Are you married?

34:17.920 --> 34:19.159
I was.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.359
Exactly - "was".

34:23.520 --> 34:24.719
How long?

34:26.920 --> 34:28.879
18 years.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.279
And how many times
did you do the dirty on her?

34:36.239 --> 34:37.239
Never.

34:43.639 --> 34:46.518
Well, it's my life,
and actually, I really like it.

34:47.960 --> 34:51.039
Oh, yeah, so what about the drugs?
The meth?

34:51.159 --> 34:54.438
See, I think you've got
one...maybe two months

34:54.560 --> 34:56.159
before your teeth start falling out.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.319
Come on, Jenny.

35:00.440 --> 35:01.879
Eh?

35:02.000 --> 35:04.999
See, the thing is, I don't think
you're doing this by choice.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.639
Not really.

35:14.840 --> 35:18.399
That's just a cuddly thought
so you can sleep at night.

35:19.560 --> 35:22.759
Nah. Need the coinage, rent to pay.

35:24.560 --> 35:25.839
What do you want?

35:30.960 --> 35:32.119
All right.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.079
Well, I can tell
I'm not gonna change your mind,

35:35.200 --> 35:37.399
so why don't you just call your mum,
let her hear your voice?

35:37.520 --> 35:39.559
It's not my voice she wants to hear.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.639
She's no different from the freaks
that get off on these films.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.199
It's not who I actually am that matters.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.679
It's who they wish I was.

35:52.480 --> 35:53.999
Jen!

36:01.800 --> 36:05.359
- I...
- Tell her I'm fine.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.519
All right, that's it, the show's over!
Come on, show's over.

36:45.640 --> 36:48.759
Oi, oi, oi. Jenny Jones...

36:48.880 --> 36:50.599
- Get off me!
- ...I'm arresting you on suspicion

36:50.720 --> 36:53.199
- of possessing a controlled substance.
- Get off me!

36:53.320 --> 36:57.119
You do not have to say anything,
but if you do not mention...

36:57.240 --> 36:58.679
Agh!

36:58.800 --> 37:00.759
Help!

37:03.920 --> 37:06.359
Help!

37:06.480 --> 37:10.439
What did I do? Didn't find any drugs!
Search me, I don't take drugs.

37:10.560 --> 37:12.239
- I'm clean.
- Can you do me a favour?

37:12.360 --> 37:14.359
Can you shut up for one second?

37:14.480 --> 37:17.159
- I'm clean! I'm clean! I'm clean!
- Justin.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.919
Did you get a beat on that DNA?

37:20.040 --> 37:23.599
Er, yeah. Cameron Pell, artist.
Well, failed artist.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.159
A history of mental illness?

37:25.280 --> 37:28.319
No. The man's got serious issues.

37:28.440 --> 37:32.079
Five years back he was arrested for
gate-crashing some modern art exhibition.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.199
He's burst in wearing a clown mask,

37:34.320 --> 37:36.279
slashed a load of paintings
with a flensing knife.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.879
When they tried to throw him out,
he's gone completely Tonto.

37:39.000 --> 37:42.239
Cut up two doormen. Lucky to escape
an attempted murder charge.

37:42.360 --> 37:44.919
- Right. Did you get an address?
- I'm gonna send it to you now.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.599
All right, um...

37:47.640 --> 37:49.759
- I'll see you there.
- Yeah, see you there.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.079
- You off to arrest someone?
- Yeah.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.039
You're screwed then
cos I'll do you for false arrest.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.719
I had reasonable and probable cause
to think you were committing a crime.

37:57.840 --> 37:59.839
Listen, one more peep out of you...

37:59.960 --> 38:02.679
- ...and it's with intent to supply.
- You're a liar.

38:02.800 --> 38:05.759
And you're a junkie hooker. I'm a copper.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.159
Do that, would you? Stitch me up?

38:08.280 --> 38:10.159
Yeah.
In a millisecond, just to shut you up.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.879
Do you even know what
they'll do to me for this?

38:12.000 --> 38:15.159
They'll break my ankles, if I'm lucky.

38:15.280 --> 38:18.759
Listen. Look at me. Nothing's
going to happen to you, all right?

38:18.880 --> 38:20.319
Yeah, who says? You?

38:20.440 --> 38:24.399
- Yeah, me.
- They do know where I live, you know.

38:24.520 --> 38:27.239
People like that, they always do.

38:42.280 --> 38:43.879
Come on.

38:50.000 --> 38:53.199
Mark, I wouldn't do this
unless I absolutely had to.

38:53.320 --> 38:54.519
Do what?

38:57.320 --> 38:58.639
John, who is this?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.599
Where am I?

39:04.720 --> 39:05.999
What part of London is this?

39:07.600 --> 39:08.999
Well, if I tell you that...

39:10.840 --> 39:13.039
...it wouldn't be a safe house, would it?

39:14.680 --> 39:16.879
And you wouldn't be in protective custody.

39:18.040 --> 39:20.199
And besides, it's only for an hour.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.359
You do know what they'll do
when they find me, don't you?

39:57.760 --> 40:01.039
Pick up, come on, come on.
Bitch, pick up!

40:01.160 --> 40:05.159
All right, now listen.
Have you done as you were asked?

40:05.280 --> 40:06.599
Have you?

40:20.720 --> 40:23.599
No sign of Cameron.
Flat's completely empty.

40:26.920 --> 40:28.559
Why the empty flat?

40:36.840 --> 40:39.119
It's almost like
he's never been here before.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.399
Hello, your call cannot be taken
at the moment,

41:00.520 --> 41:02.799
so please leave your message
after the tone.

41:05.480 --> 41:06.799
I know you're there.

41:09.760 --> 41:14.239
Benny, it's Ripley, mate. I need you to
trace a call going to this number, yeah?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.439
Hello, Cameron.

41:18.520 --> 41:19.639
How's your arm?

41:19.760 --> 41:24.879
You think,
because you tasted my blood,

41:25.000 --> 41:27.159
that you know what I am.

41:27.280 --> 41:31.439
Well, to be fair,
I am standing in your flat.

41:31.560 --> 41:33.799
You don't know what I am.

41:33.920 --> 41:36.999
- And you don't know where I am.
- Where are you?

41:38.000 --> 41:41.599
Everywhere! I can walk down any street.
I can peer...

41:41.720 --> 41:43.359
- He's close, less than a mile.
- I can knock

41:43.480 --> 41:46.839
on any door. I am the shape at the window.

41:46.960 --> 41:49.119
I am the hand under the bed.

41:50.320 --> 41:51.999
So what's the play, Cameron?

41:52.120 --> 41:55.799
Cos that's what it is, isn't it?
It's a play.

41:55.920 --> 42:00.079
With Cameron Pell starring as Mr Punch.

42:00.200 --> 42:03.319
Do you know anything about this city?

42:03.440 --> 42:08.079
Well, I know that it smells a bit funny
when it gets hot.

42:08.200 --> 42:15.079
This, now, everything, this place,
this time, this cretinised culture.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.319
- We are the richest, most decadent...
- Less than three minutes.

42:18.440 --> 42:22.439
...people that ever lived.
And still we're dissatisfied.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.879
We have lost our history.
We have lost our myths.

42:26.000 --> 42:28.759
You see, kids in Whitechapel

42:28.880 --> 42:33.079
play video games in which
they score points by killing prostitutes.

42:34.240 --> 42:38.799
They're totally indifferent to the spectre
that walks past their window.

42:39.960 --> 42:40.879
This is a dead city.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.199
It's an unreal city. Do you know why?

42:44.320 --> 42:46.599
No, why don't you tell me why?

42:46.720 --> 42:49.999
We are so indifferent that we don't care.

42:50.120 --> 42:52.999
- It's like we're medicated.
- How are you going to make us wake up?

42:53.120 --> 42:57.759
I'm going to remind people
what it's like to be really scared.

42:57.880 --> 43:00.079
Have you ever heard
of Spring-Heeled Jack?

43:00.200 --> 43:05.599
Spring-Heeled Jack? I've heard
of Spring-Heeled Jack. Victorian bogeyman.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.479
Mask, red eyes.

43:07.600 --> 43:11.399
Are you cribbing your ideas
from penny-dreadfuls?

43:11.520 --> 43:15.679
They called him the Terror of London,
and do you know what made him terrifying?

43:15.800 --> 43:18.359
He could do whatever he liked
to whomever he chose,

43:18.480 --> 43:21.159
wherever he chose, whenever he chose,
and he was never caught.

43:21.280 --> 43:24.719
He just disappeared, passed into folklore.

43:24.840 --> 43:25.759
Oh, yeah?

43:25.880 --> 43:28.719
- Is that what you want to do, eh?
- I've already done it.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.999
You just don't know it yet.

43:31.120 --> 43:32.799
Are you sure about that?
Because the last time we spoke

43:32.920 --> 43:35.119
you were pretty scared
that I was gonna ruin it.

43:35.240 --> 43:39.119
- Nice one, mate.
- Yeah, I was, but not any more.

43:39.240 --> 43:43.719
Why should I be scared?
I can take anyone I choose. You can watch.

43:43.840 --> 43:45.759
- Later tonight.
- What do you mean?

43:45.880 --> 43:47.399
I hope you're excited, because I am.

43:47.520 --> 43:50.399
Watch what, Cameron?
Hey, Cameron, what do you mean?

43:50.520 --> 43:53.199
What are you going to show me tonight? Eh?

43:53.320 --> 43:54.399
Cameron!

43:56.400 --> 43:57.519
- How long?
- Less than a minute.

43:57.640 --> 43:58.479
Too late.

43:59.680 --> 44:00.879
He's gone.

44:18.720 --> 44:20.079
What time is it?

44:21.240 --> 44:22.879
Well, it's late.

44:23.000 --> 44:26.719
- He said he'd only be an hour.
- Yeah.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.679
I need the loo.

44:30.800 --> 44:31.879
No key.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.159
Aren't you tired?

44:40.760 --> 44:42.839
Opposite. You?

44:42.960 --> 44:46.599
- I'm absolutely knackered.
- Get some sleep.

44:47.880 --> 44:51.599
Lie down, chill out,
make yourself at home.

44:51.720 --> 44:54.239
Yeah, wake up
and find all my credit cards gone.

44:57.240 --> 45:00.679
How do you know him? That gavver?

45:01.680 --> 45:03.559
- Gavver?
- Smurf.

45:03.680 --> 45:05.119
Billy Filth.

45:06.440 --> 45:08.959
Cos you're obviously not one of them,
no offence whatever.

45:09.080 --> 45:10.159
No offence taken.

45:11.200 --> 45:14.079
Well, um...it's a long story.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.359
So give me the edited highlights.

45:16.480 --> 45:18.039
OK.

45:18.160 --> 45:21.239
OK, long story, short version.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.919
I was going to marry his ex-wife.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.799
Seriously?!

45:29.920 --> 45:32.439
What, and now you're mates,
and everything?

45:32.560 --> 45:35.999
Well, mates is probably pushing it.

45:36.120 --> 45:39.879
So where is she? His ex, your missus?

45:42.000 --> 45:43.319
She died.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.639
Ouch!

45:44.760 --> 45:46.319
Sorry.

45:48.320 --> 45:50.399
- Mouth on me sometimes.
- That's all right.

45:50.520 --> 45:51.959
You weren't to know.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.079
- What about you? How do you know him?
- Don't.

45:58.080 --> 45:59.479
Not really.

46:00.520 --> 46:03.919
As far as I'm concerned, he's this random
smurf popped up out of nowhere.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.759
So why the...?

46:08.960 --> 46:10.479
Long time ago...

46:14.040 --> 46:15.919
...my dad killed this girl.

46:17.280 --> 46:20.839
It was by accident and everything,
but...he panicked.

46:23.040 --> 46:24.559
Cut her up and whatnot.

46:26.880 --> 46:29.439
- Put all the bits in wheelie bins.
- Jesus.

46:32.440 --> 46:33.479
I'm sorry.

46:33.600 --> 46:36.799
So this bloke, Luther,
was one of the coppers that put him away.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.359
And your dad?

46:42.000 --> 46:43.559
Killed himself in prison.

46:47.520 --> 46:52.039
Jenny, listen, I know how hard...
how hard it can be.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.119
Losing someone that way.

47:07.880 --> 47:09.519
Where is Cameron?

47:11.400 --> 47:13.879
I haven't seen Cameron for two years.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.919
I don't know what you expect me
to tell you.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.919
No offence, but I think you do.

47:22.080 --> 47:24.639
So, you were at art school together?

47:24.760 --> 47:28.199
Well...I was at art school.

47:29.720 --> 47:32.039
He'd hang around the refectory.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.399
Sort of, you know...

47:35.400 --> 47:36.839
...talking art.

47:36.960 --> 47:38.559
Did he ever talk about...

47:40.040 --> 47:41.039
...this?

47:46.000 --> 47:47.439
Spring-Heeled Jack?

47:48.480 --> 47:49.479
Yeah.

47:50.680 --> 47:52.399
About ten zillion times.

47:53.440 --> 47:55.319
Yes, it was his childhood obsession.

47:55.440 --> 47:58.639
Spring-Heeled Jack's in the cupboard.

47:58.760 --> 48:03.199
Spring-Heeled Jack's waiting at the bottom
of the garden, in the bushes.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.399
He had to see somebody about it.

48:06.520 --> 48:09.639
A psychologist or a psychoanalyst.

48:10.680 --> 48:13.519
Anyway, they teased him about it.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.599
It made him feel like a freak.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.479
I suppose he was a freak, really.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.759
Still is.

48:24.760 --> 48:26.879
A freaky little freak.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.999
Did Cameron ever hurt you?

48:34.120 --> 48:35.039
No.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.319
- Why did you hesitate?
- Because sometimes...

48:38.440 --> 48:40.919
he'd get this look in his eyes.

48:42.200 --> 48:43.639
What look?

48:46.640 --> 48:48.199
Like he wanted to.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.799
- Boss...sorry, this is urgent.
- Yes?

48:58.720 --> 49:00.559
It's him. You're gonna wanna see this.

49:00.560 --> 49:01.159
It's him. You're gonna wanna see this.

49:01.280 --> 49:04.559
- What is it, Benny?
- This has just come in.

49:07.520 --> 49:09.079
Is this live?

49:09.200 --> 49:11.239
Yep, it's happening right now. It's live.

49:11.360 --> 49:14.679
Jesus, some sort of hand-held webcam,
or something.

49:14.800 --> 49:17.239
It's being sent to us directly.

49:17.360 --> 49:18.879
He's taunting us.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.559
- Do we know the street?
- Can't tell.

49:23.080 --> 49:27.599
I want everyone on this.
We need to find that street.

49:27.720 --> 49:30.479
- Partial plate.
- Dig it up. Give me an address.

49:30.600 --> 49:33.319
- Benny, can you send it over?
- Yeah, it's with you now.

49:33.440 --> 49:36.999
Gray, quick as you can.
Come on. Erin!

49:38.680 --> 49:40.279
He's knocking on doors.

49:40.400 --> 49:41.599
- Gray, come on!
- It's coming, it's coming!

49:41.720 --> 49:45.119
There's 80 vehicles with that partial.
Benny, can you narrow down the model?

49:45.240 --> 49:48.439
It's a light-brown...gold BMW 5 series.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.719
- Please don't open that door.
- Late '80s, early '90s.

49:52.720 --> 49:55.159
- No answer.
- Thank God.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.559
- Got it! Registered to Grant Morrison...
- He's gone to the other house.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.439
- ...37 Eastmead Street.
- Wait, let me double-check.

50:00.560 --> 50:02.519
- What?
- He might be parked on the next street.

50:02.640 --> 50:05.119
Could be outside his girlfriend's house,
might have lent his car to a mate.

50:05.240 --> 50:07.639
Eastmead Street runs alongside a canal
and that's...

50:07.760 --> 50:10.359
Where the hell is this?
Come on, find it, find it.

50:10.480 --> 50:13.439
Check every street within half a mile
north to southwest of Eastmead Street.

50:13.560 --> 50:15.839
Don't open it. No.

50:15.960 --> 50:16.879
No!

50:19.880 --> 50:20.839
No, no!

50:33.520 --> 50:34.759
No, no!

50:45.960 --> 50:49.959
Er, it's Egmont Terrace,
two streets southwest.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.159
All right, call it in.

50:52.280 --> 50:56.559
This is DS Gray, SSU, requesting urgent
armed response to Egmont Terrace, E1.

50:58.000 --> 50:59.639
And send an ambulance.

51:24.440 --> 51:26.119
Did something happen?

51:29.680 --> 51:30.919
DS Gray...

51:32.320 --> 51:35.319
...DS Ripley,
please escort Miss Calvert home.

51:41.480 --> 51:42.919
This way, please.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.239
Right, this way, please.

51:55.640 --> 51:57.039
How are you feeling?

52:00.040 --> 52:01.199
I'm angry.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.159
Too angry?

52:05.400 --> 52:06.999
Just angry enough.

52:08.360 --> 52:10.799
Because I can't have the wheels
coming off this thing, John.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.319
They won't, Martin.

52:13.320 --> 52:15.759
I fought tooth and nail
to get you back into the fold.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.559
I fought hard and I fought dirty.

52:19.760 --> 52:21.599
Don't squander it now.

53:01.320 --> 53:03.559
- I was just wondering...
- Yeah?

53:04.680 --> 53:06.159
Would you mind just coming up with me?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.319
Just to check under the bed,
that sort of thing.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.839
- I just keep thinking...
- Of course, that's not silly at all.

53:15.080 --> 53:18.279
All units, Sierra Oscar 52, IC1,

53:18.400 --> 53:21.279
dark clothing,
medium-length, light-brown hair.

53:21.400 --> 53:25.039
- Suspect at large.
- Give me 9-0 in the town centre, please.

53:43.080 --> 53:44.959
I live just upstairs.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.599
It's the shop.

54:50.920 --> 54:52.439
Do you want a cup of tea?

54:53.880 --> 54:55.839
I'll just check upstairs.

55:31.040 --> 55:33.519
Sorry, it's just a fuse.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.399
Oh!

56:06.560 --> 56:08.079
Ripley, all clear on the house.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.159
I'm just going to
make sure Miss Calvert's all right.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.759
OK, copy that.

56:36.880 --> 56:42.319
