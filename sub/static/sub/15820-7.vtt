00:44.296 --> 00:45.697
I'm vibrating.

01:01.208 --> 01:03.710
Go ahead. Answer.

01:16.719 --> 01:18.603
Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson.

01:18.643 --> 01:22.141
Brenda, hi, it's Will. Um,
I'm sorry to call so late,

01:22.342 --> 01:25.114
but we have a dead
judge in Griffith Park.

01:33.089 --> 01:34.578
I'm on my way.

01:40.939 --> 01:42.140
Sorry.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.307
–'99 Napa Merlot. Very nice.
–Oh, I'm serious.

02:00.365 --> 02:02.962
You're fine. You only had one glass.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.278
It was a big one.

02:11.996 --> 02:13.026
Here's good.

02:13.026 --> 02:15.581
–I can drop you off up there.
–No, no, no, no. This is good.

02:15.621 --> 02:18.129
Not a problem. Look, there's the pope.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.398
Perfect.

02:22.098 --> 02:25.198
Thank you. Thank you
so much. Good night.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.190
Yeah, no problem.

02:41.051 --> 02:41.996
–Brenda…
–Yes?

02:42.296 --> 02:45.118
Presiding judge came down,
district attorney's office is here,

02:45.158 --> 02:48.006
so warrants, phone taps,
whatever you need, let me know.

02:48.046 --> 02:49.263
Ok. Thank you.

02:49.263 --> 02:50.992
Who's your chauffer?

02:53.980 --> 02:56.496
I'm gonna go look at the body, Will.

03:05.688 --> 03:07.148
Introduce me, please.

03:07.148 --> 03:09.722
Uh, the honorable Michael Thompson, 49.

03:09.855 --> 03:12.165
He's a state judge, criminal court.

03:12.169 --> 03:15.135
Guy out walking his dog practically
tripped over the body around 11:30.

03:15.175 --> 03:19.356
Called 911 and the patrolman who
answered the call recognized his face.

03:19.396 --> 03:20.491
2 gunshots…

03:20.691 --> 03:23.991
one to the side, one to
the forehead, close range.

03:24.320 --> 03:26.828
–We found one slug so far.
–Excuse me.

03:30.607 --> 03:33.234
No wallet? Any sign of his car?

03:33.534 --> 03:35.471
The judge drives a black '94 Mercedes.

03:35.511 --> 03:38.383
We checked the lots and swept the
streets within a half mile. Nada.

03:38.423 --> 03:39.992
No onstar, no lojack.

03:40.392 --> 03:43.587
You want us to put out a
broadcast on the vehicle?

03:43.627 --> 03:45.680
Send a black and white
to his house first.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.096
See if it's sittin' in his driveway.

03:48.277 --> 03:49.836
What's his body temperature?

03:49.876 --> 03:51.605
Uh, 96.2

03:51.605 --> 03:54.059
uh-huh. So, that's about 3 hours.

03:55.011 --> 03:58.574
What is a judge doing at
Griffith Park at 10:30 at night?

03:58.614 --> 04:00.215
According to the presiding judge,

04:00.255 --> 04:03.400
Thompson plays poker at a lawyer's house

04:03.570 --> 04:06.210
not too far from here. Guy named Mackey.

04:14.186 --> 04:15.313
It's the stiff.

04:21.004 --> 04:22.675
Area code 480. Where's that?

04:22.715 --> 04:24.157
Phoenix. Phoenix?

04:24.157 --> 04:25.153
Hello?

04:25.188 --> 04:26.186
No, who's this?

04:27.245 --> 04:28.408
No, who's this?

04:29.746 --> 04:34.271
Oh, I'm sorry, Michael can't come to the
phone right now. May I ask who's calling?

04:34.311 --> 04:35.367
What… I'm sorry.

04:36.415 --> 04:37.399
Who's Keith?

04:38.200 --> 04:39.722
J
–just calm down. I…

04:40.423 --> 04:42.403
no, no, no, no. Don't hang up.

04:47.375 --> 04:50.477
Ladies and gentlemen,
we need to find that car.

04:50.939 --> 04:52.340
Uh, lieutenant Flynn,

04:52.340 --> 04:56.116
could you please trace that phone call, see
if it comes from a cell phone or a land line?

04:56.156 --> 04:57.508
Detectives Sanchez, Daniels,

04:57.548 --> 04:59.364
I'd like you to check that poker game,

04:59.404 --> 05:00.733
and sergeant Gabriel,

05:00.773 --> 05:02.253
I need you to get the K-9s up here.

05:02.293 --> 05:04.693
We may have a possible
fugitive or another victim.

05:04.733 --> 05:05.652
What's going on? Where are you…

05:05.692 --> 05:08.569
uh, chief Pope, may I borrow
you for a moment, please?

05:08.609 --> 05:11.782
I need your judge to get a search
warrant form the Thompson's house.

05:11.822 --> 05:12.632
What's up?

05:12.667 --> 05:15.769
I just talked to Mrs
Thompson and it looks like

05:16.146 --> 05:18.918
we may be missing the
judge's teenage son.

05:29.661 --> 05:32.499
–What?
–You know you're missing an earring.

05:32.848 --> 05:34.393
Oh. I was in a hurry.

05:36.533 --> 05:39.544
Now why… why would they
put bars on the windows

05:39.584 --> 05:41.120
in such a nice neighborhood?

05:41.160 --> 05:43.399
Lots of people put
'em up after the riots.

05:43.439 --> 05:44.561
Well, it's tacky.

05:46.383 --> 05:47.268
Lieutenant.

05:47.386 --> 05:48.376
On your signal.

05:48.695 --> 05:50.147
All right, then, good.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.132
Here we go.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.754
Mackey's house is up there on the left.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.650
Liquor in the front, poker in the rear.

06:14.850 --> 06:15.972
What are you, 12?

06:16.066 --> 06:18.692
Ooh. Ooh, we got a little temper.

06:19.395 --> 06:21.177
Got a little latino in you.

06:21.368 --> 06:22.318
Yeah?

06:22.353 --> 06:24.795
You want a little more latino in you?

06:25.117 --> 06:28.681
You know what? You gotta be
this tall to ride my ride.

06:28.845 --> 06:29.790
Aww… stop.

06:29.990 --> 06:30.879
What?

06:31.078 --> 06:31.994
Over there.

06:41.764 --> 06:43.422
Code 4, no kid, no car.

06:43.530 --> 06:46.336
Thank you, thank you very
much, gentlemen. Good night.

06:46.376 --> 06:47.327
Thanks, guys.

06:53.998 --> 06:56.400
Don't open any drawers. The
warrant's only good for the boy.

06:56.440 --> 06:59.740
I know, I heard you the
first 3 times you said it.

07:01.351 --> 07:03.916
Oh, shoot! Can I borrow your cell phone?

07:03.956 --> 07:04.877
What's wrong with yours?

07:04.917 --> 07:05.669
Oh, just…

07:06.490 --> 07:07.539
here.

07:08.991 --> 07:09.923
Thank you.

07:15.578 --> 07:16.846
No, Will, it's me.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.155
No, the boy's not here.

07:19.786 --> 07:21.124
No. Of course.

07:21.826 --> 07:24.460
Yes, of course, you'll
be the second to know.

07:24.500 --> 07:25.240
Good night.

07:28.399 --> 07:29.950
Real homey vibe.

07:32.769 --> 07:34.881
Furniture's bolted to the floor.

08:05.133 --> 08:10.216
“Sad, angry, confused…”

08:16.149 --> 08:17.682
so what do you think?

08:28.808 --> 08:31.595
Keith Thompson is autistic.

08:31.895 --> 08:34.073
What's that, like, semi-retarded?

08:34.577 --> 08:36.557
It's a developmental disorder,

08:36.684 --> 08:38.006
something we should all keep in mind

08:38.046 --> 08:40.120
when trying to find this
boy, so what do we have?

08:40.159 --> 08:43.804
Dogs found about 100 homeless
guys in the park, but no Keith.

08:43.844 --> 08:48.134
Mackey says the judge and Keith
left the poker game around 10:00.

08:48.266 --> 08:49.323
That's the last anybody saw of him.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.610
Took his son to a poker game?

08:50.650 --> 08:52.569
Keith's regular caregiver
was out with the flu.

08:52.609 --> 08:54.094
Still no sign of the Mercedes?

08:54.134 --> 08:57.219
Nothing, but the glass Sanchez
and Daniels found is factory.

08:57.259 --> 08:59.899
Matches what would be on a '94 Mercedes.

09:00.312 --> 09:02.096
–Where'd you get that?
–That place.

09:02.136 --> 09:05.843
Uh, if this is a routine carjacking,
that car was chopped hours ago.

09:05.883 --> 09:08.828
Wouldn't a carjacker who
had no qualms killing a judge

09:08.868 --> 09:10.386
also have killed Keith?

09:13.684 --> 09:17.908
Sanchez, you said you found these
cigarettes close to the glass.

09:18.185 --> 09:20.361
Yes, I'm thinking that the carjacker

09:20.401 --> 09:22.583
probably waited, hoping for the
first nice car to come along.

09:22.623 --> 09:24.601
No, what about a specific nice car?

09:24.641 --> 09:25.933
What do you mean, like a hit?

09:25.973 --> 09:28.713
Judges tend to leave hurt
feelings in their wake.

09:28.753 --> 09:30.435
Anything from Thompson's
previous trials?

09:30.475 --> 09:33.247
I collected files on
guys with the motives

09:33.407 --> 09:35.289
and the means to settle out of court.

09:35.329 --> 09:36.220
What about the kid?

09:36.260 --> 09:39.094
I mean, maybe he went a little
menendez on his rich old man

09:39.134 --> 09:41.303
and now he's on the run in daddy's car?

09:41.343 --> 09:42.879
Flynn, the kid's autistic.
He's not going to…

09:42.919 --> 09:44.069
he's also a teenager,

09:44.109 --> 09:45.518
which is scary enough for me.

09:45.558 --> 09:47.557
Besides, murder ain't rocket science.

09:47.597 --> 09:49.858
Einstein was a bit autistic, I mean,

09:49.898 --> 09:51.489
he was never diagnosed or anything,

09:51.529 --> 09:53.334
but there was this documentary…

09:53.374 --> 09:55.090
thank you, lieutenant Tao.

09:55.988 --> 09:57.914
At this point, we
can't rule anything out.

09:57.954 --> 10:01.254
Where's my son Keith? Can
I talk to chief Johnson?

10:06.209 --> 10:08.871
Ok, let's get to work.

10:12.881 --> 10:13.724
Here you go.

10:14.124 --> 10:16.764
Why didn't you tell me Michael was dead?

10:18.539 --> 10:20.776
I am so sorry, Mrs Thompson.

10:21.076 --> 10:23.167
I wish I could have told
you more over the phone,

10:23.207 --> 10:24.802
but unfortunately, police procedure

10:24.842 --> 10:27.752
requires that I confirm
you are who you say you are

10:27.792 --> 10:30.236
before giving away any
information. I would have…

10:30.276 --> 10:31.713
where is my son?

10:32.413 --> 10:33.271
I don't know,

10:33.534 --> 10:34.697
but I can assure you

10:34.737 --> 10:37.717
that we are doing everything
we can to find him.

10:37.757 --> 10:40.271
Look, I know that your son is autistic

10:40.971 --> 10:43.151
and I know how upset you must be,

10:43.251 --> 10:45.697
but I need you to answer
a few questions for me.

10:45.737 --> 10:46.793
Can you do that?

10:48.255 --> 10:50.565
You called last night from Phoenix?

10:50.601 --> 10:52.959
That's where I live since the divorce.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.813
Why were you calling
your ex-husband so late?

10:54.853 --> 10:56.778
I wasn't. I was looking for Keith.

10:56.818 --> 10:59.285
I call him at 10:00 to say good night,

10:59.325 --> 11:01.197
and when no one answered at the house,

11:01.237 --> 11:04.619
I started to worry and I
kept calling every 10 minutes

11:04.659 --> 11:06.243
and then Michael's cell.

11:06.634 --> 11:09.258
So your son lives with his father here?

11:09.258 --> 11:10.908
Michael has custody, yes.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.434
Raising an autistic child is expensive,

11:13.474 --> 11:16.605
and I needed to prove to the
court that I could support Keith

11:16.645 --> 11:20.869
and the only faculty position I
could find was at Arizona state.

11:20.923 --> 11:23.169
It was the hardest decision of my life,

11:23.209 --> 11:25.060
but in the end, Michael and I

11:25.100 --> 11:28.891
both agreed that it was best
for Keith that he stay here

11:29.791 --> 11:33.289
and have as little change
in his routine as possible.

11:33.346 --> 11:34.313
He gets…

11:34.913 --> 11:35.883
gets very…

11:36.683 --> 11:38.820
upset with change.

11:39.728 --> 11:41.234
How upset?

11:43.434 --> 11:45.823
I saw the furniture bolted to the floor.

11:45.863 --> 11:47.582
We did that for his own protection.

11:47.622 --> 11:50.595
I mean, Keith gets frustrated
with certain things,

11:50.635 --> 11:53.869
but he's just not capable
of something like this.

11:55.555 --> 11:58.921
Can you think of anyone
who might be capable of it?

12:00.188 --> 12:04.214
How many people has Michael
sentenced over the last 10 years?

12:06.195 --> 12:09.759
I have been going over judge
Thompson's current trials

12:10.222 --> 12:12.256
and one name keeps rising to the top.

12:12.296 --> 12:13.022
Eddie Hoke.

12:13.309 --> 12:15.777
We busted him for running
chop shops in the valley,

12:15.817 --> 12:17.134
but he's hooked into everything:

12:17.174 --> 12:18.316
Murder, grand theft, dope.

12:18.356 --> 12:19.542
This guy's a big fish.

12:19.582 --> 12:21.079
And according to Thompson's clerk,

12:21.119 --> 12:23.277
Hoke's defense was going
down the tubes fast.

12:23.317 --> 12:26.485
The judge was overruling
every single objection.

12:26.514 --> 12:27.916
Thompson was one of the good ones.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.533
And 3 days into the trial,

12:29.573 --> 12:30.721
the judge received a death threat.

12:30.761 --> 12:32.835
Maybe I should bring him
back in for questioning.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.647
Carjacking is part of his DNA.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.842
Actually, I'd like to talk to him.

12:35.882 --> 12:38.142
Well, my guys have been
working this case for months.

12:38.182 --> 12:39.302
We know what buttons to push.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.127
I'm not trying to steal credit for captain
Taylor's arrest, it's just that I…

12:42.167 --> 12:45.553
whoa, whoa, whoa, this
isn't a pissing contest.

12:45.653 --> 12:47.706
I just think in the interest
of finding the boy…

12:47.746 --> 12:49.931
all right, ok, bring him in

12:51.131 --> 12:54.167
and the two of you will
question him together.

12:56.124 --> 12:57.165
Go away.

12:57.973 --> 12:59.059
Thank you.

13:01.253 --> 13:03.101
–Thank you.
–You're welcome.

13:03.672 --> 13:05.862
This is harassment. I
should file for a mistrial.

13:05.902 --> 13:08.498
Why? Looks like the trial is
suddenly moving in your favor,

13:08.538 --> 13:10.331
wouldn't you agree, Mr Hoke?

13:10.371 --> 13:11.361
What can I say?

13:11.516 --> 13:13.298
Somebody up there likes me.

13:13.427 --> 13:14.850
That's a good thing, Ed.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.134
Cause I'm pretty sure
nobody down here does.

13:17.174 --> 13:20.695
My client was in your cell
when this murder took place.

13:20.735 --> 13:22.272
Maybe one of his loyal employees

13:22.312 --> 13:24.440
was just following orders,
but let's put that aside.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.726
Right now, all I care about
is finding the judge's son

13:26.766 --> 13:28.152
before it's too late.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.299
Let's say for the sake of discussion

13:32.699 --> 13:34.853
that I might know
where to find this kid.

13:34.893 --> 13:37.076
–You do not…
–This is all hypothetical, right?

13:37.116 --> 13:39.029
Of course I don't know
anything about him,

13:39.069 --> 13:41.304
but if I did,

13:41.504 --> 13:44.408
would this influence
the charges against me?

13:44.560 --> 13:45.586
It might.

13:45.621 --> 13:49.477
Deputy Chief Johnson doesn't
have the authority to make a deal.

13:49.517 --> 13:50.957
I could persuade the DA.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.439
to see the value of this information.

13:53.851 --> 13:57.699
And what kind of deal might
you hypothetically recommend?

13:59.735 --> 14:01.471
I'll get back to you on that one.

14:01.511 --> 14:02.870
Thank you so much.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.521
This is the lot manager who saw the car.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.948
Recognized the description
from the police bulletin.

14:15.988 --> 14:18.550
We had one of our undercovers
stake it for 20 minutes, but…

14:18.590 --> 14:20.039
nobody's coming back.

14:20.074 --> 14:22.412
Someone pop the trunk, please.

14:31.495 --> 14:36.244
22,801,242,66, where am I?

14:36.669 --> 14:39.058
–Where am I? 1,3,22…
–You're at the airport.

14:39.098 --> 14:41.410
801,242,66, where am I?

14:42.045 --> 14:45.406
We found him in the trunk of the
car at the park'n'go at L. A. X.

14:45.446 --> 14:48.640
–It's ok. It's ok.
–Where am I? Where am I?

14:53.732 --> 14:54.920
How's Keith doing?

14:55.071 --> 14:56.245
As well as can be expected.

14:56.285 --> 14:59.981
Did he mention anything about
Michael? About last night?

14:59.988 --> 15:03.170
Nothing. I tried to explain
to him that Michael was dead,

15:03.210 --> 15:04.641
but I don't think it sunk in.

15:04.681 --> 15:08.245
There are some things that
he just doesn't understand.

15:08.688 --> 15:11.135
Michael always had a
hard time with that.

15:11.175 --> 15:14.219
He really wanted Keith to be normal.

15:14.818 --> 15:17.260
Public schools, no special treatment.

15:18.141 --> 15:19.645
Then something like this happens,

15:19.685 --> 15:22.523
and you realize how
different he really is.

15:23.016 --> 15:25.977
Do you mind if sergeant Gabriel
and I try and talk to him?

15:26.017 --> 15:29.911
–Oh, he's not very talkative…
–it'll just be a few minutes.

15:30.116 --> 15:35.231
Keith? Some police officers
want to ask you a few questions.

15:36.643 --> 15:38.224
Hi, Keith. I'm Brenda.

15:42.022 --> 15:43.316
You know…

15:44.210 --> 15:49.028
I heard if you can tell what kind of
food that is, they give you a prize.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.677
He doesn't understand jokes.

15:52.717 --> 15:54.169
Is that what that was?

15:56.109 --> 16:02.138
Um… Keith, do you remember going
to Mr Mackey's house with your dad?

16:03.036 --> 16:07.524
Do you remember going for a ride
with your dad after the poker game?

16:07.709 --> 16:08.669
Where am I?

16:08.803 --> 16:10.178
You're in a hospital, sweetheart.

16:10.218 --> 16:11.149
You're in a hospital

16:11.189 --> 16:13.844
in room 320 on the third floor.

16:14.044 --> 16:17.980
1,3,22,801,

16:17.980 --> 16:19.972
24266.

16:20.172 --> 16:21.667
Keith, what do those numbers mean?

16:21.707 --> 16:23.630
1,3,22,

16:23.630 --> 16:26.246
801,24266.

16:26.446 --> 16:28.445
He was saying those
numbers when we found him

16:28.485 --> 16:29.474
and asking “where am I?”

16:29.514 --> 16:30.740
Is that normal for him?

16:30.780 --> 16:35.202
Sometimes when he's under stress,
he'll moan or he'll chant things.

16:35.404 --> 16:36.856
Does it mean anything?

16:36.976 --> 16:37.986
Maybe to him.

16:40.508 --> 16:44.967
22,801,24266.

16:45.766 --> 16:47.533
Keith, it's ok.

16:51.030 --> 16:52.611
Aah! No! No!

16:52.611 --> 16:56.560
No! Ah! No! No!

16:57.673 --> 16:58.976
I am so sorry.

16:59.376 --> 17:01.531
He doesn't like to be
touched. It's just reflex.

17:01.571 --> 17:04.038
He didn't do it before
at the parking lot.

17:04.078 --> 17:05.726
He was in shock. I'm so sorry.

17:05.766 --> 17:09.267
It's ok, really. It's… it's my fault.

17:09.367 --> 17:11.136
It'll be easier for him
when he can get out of here.

17:11.175 --> 17:13.385
The doctor said that I
can take him home tomorrow.

17:13.425 --> 17:16.698
Uh, actually, it's
not quite that simple.

17:16.897 --> 17:21.098
Mrs Thompson technically
isn't Keith's legal guardian.

17:21.298 --> 17:22.426
But I'm his mother.

17:22.467 --> 17:23.375
Yes, madam.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.156
Oh, unfortunately, what sergeant Gabriel

17:26.196 --> 17:27.252
is trying to say

17:27.396 --> 17:29.509
is that you can't
take your son home yet.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.433
You should be able to, I know,

17:31.473 --> 17:34.011
but under the law, there has
to be a custody hearing first.

17:34.051 --> 17:35.902
Children services takes
care of him until then.

17:35.942 --> 17:37.209
But only for a few days.

17:37.249 --> 17:39.236
You mean a foster home? This is crazy.

17:39.276 --> 17:41.008
His father is dead.
He should be with me.

17:41.048 --> 17:45.782
You have no idea the damage that this kind
of disruption can do to an autistic child.

17:45.822 --> 17:47.649
It's horrible. Jillian, I know.

17:47.689 --> 17:51.192
But you have my word I
will do everything I can

17:51.392 --> 17:54.537
to get your son back to
you as quickly as possible.

17:54.577 --> 17:57.679
What can we do to keep
her from taking her son?

17:57.890 --> 17:59.106
Well, nothing.

17:59.106 --> 18:00.976
Children services will pick
Keith up at the hospital

18:01.016 --> 18:02.528
and take him to his foster home,

18:02.568 --> 18:04.237
and then the courts will
fast-track the custody hearing

18:04.277 --> 18:05.239
and get him back to mom.

18:05.279 --> 18:06.731
Can we slow them down?

18:06.900 --> 18:10.222
You want to prevent a mother from
getting back her traumatized autistic son?

18:10.262 --> 18:12.373
He's either my one witness
or my prime suspect.

18:12.413 --> 18:15.948
If she gets custody, she'll take him to
Phoenix and I'll end up having to extradite him.

18:15.988 --> 18:18.065
Wait, wait, wait. Earlier,
you thought Hoke was the guy,

18:18.105 --> 18:19.160
now you think the kid did it?

18:19.200 --> 18:23.685
They say the ability to hold 2 contradictory
ideas at the same time is genius.

18:23.725 --> 18:26.563
Either way, I need
more time with that boy.

18:27.457 --> 18:30.388
Ok, look, I can arrange for you to
transfer Keith to the foster home.

18:30.428 --> 18:32.165
That'll buy you a couple of hours.

18:32.205 --> 18:33.161
Ok.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.987
–Just promise me one thing.
–What?

18:35.027 --> 18:36.017
Don't touch him

18:36.277 --> 18:38.521
cause I hear he doesn't like that.

18:44.107 --> 18:46.489
Low-functioning autistics
have no language skills.

18:46.529 --> 18:49.185
They cannot survive
independently by themselves.

18:49.225 --> 18:50.388
Keith's not like that.

18:50.428 --> 18:53.801
According to his school records,

18:53.801 --> 18:55.234
he's very intelligent,
but he does have issues.

18:55.274 --> 18:56.396
He's unemotional.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.912
Frequently says inappropriate things.

18:58.952 --> 19:00.152
He's very literal-minded.

19:00.192 --> 19:01.872
He gets fixated on minor details.

19:01.912 --> 19:04.785
He gets agitated when
his routine is altered,

19:04.825 --> 19:06.716
and he's extremely uncooperative

19:06.756 --> 19:08.727
when anything or anyone gets in the way

19:08.767 --> 19:09.967
of him doing what he wants.

19:10.007 --> 19:11.675
Does he have a Georgia accent?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.955
But we can figure out how…

19:19.921 --> 19:22.611
If we can figure out how to
communicate with this boy,

19:22.651 --> 19:24.335
he might be able to tell
us who pulled the trigger.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.028
Even if he's the shooter?

19:26.190 --> 19:29.160
It looks like he might
have a violent streak.

19:30.229 --> 19:32.886
Let's start by putting together photos

19:32.886 --> 19:34.045
for Keith to look at…

19:34.085 --> 19:35.427
known associates of Eddie Hoke,

19:35.467 --> 19:37.379
former defendants the
judge might have put away,

19:37.419 --> 19:38.956
carjackers.

19:39.606 --> 19:42.673
Chief, the kid's not gonna tell
us anything. He's in his own world.

19:42.713 --> 19:44.301
Well, pack your bags, sergeant,

19:44.341 --> 19:46.717
cause we're going there for a visit.

19:56.001 --> 19:57.783
Now you take your time now…

19:58.505 --> 20:00.617
tell me if you recognize anyone.

20:02.099 --> 20:03.617
Your breath smells bad.

20:04.948 --> 20:07.522
That's cause I've been up for 36 hours.

20:08.288 --> 20:09.093
Hey.

20:10.094 --> 20:11.986
Oh, wow. What happened?

20:12.787 --> 20:14.697
Oh, nothing. No, it's fine.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.750
Nothing. I just…

20:19.236 --> 20:21.168
um, this is Keith.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.942
Keith, this is, uh…

20:23.380 --> 20:26.329
hey, Keith, I'm Fritz. I'm Brenda's…

20:27.581 --> 20:29.491
gonna say “boyfriend,”
but I get a feeling

20:29.531 --> 20:30.511
that's a dirty word around here.

20:30.551 --> 20:32.258
Oh, you're just too
sensitive, that's all.

20:32.298 --> 20:33.336
I thought girls liked that.

20:33.376 --> 20:34.673
Np, that's just something we say.

20:34.713 --> 20:35.931
Thought you might want your phone back.

20:35.971 --> 20:37.423
You left it in my car…

20:38.017 --> 20:39.763
along with your earring.

20:42.346 --> 20:44.722
I was just all over the place today.

20:45.603 --> 20:48.597
–I… I… I'm sorry about…
–it's ok. Explain it to me over lunch.

20:48.637 --> 20:49.741
No!

20:49.884 --> 20:51.324
–Keith, are you ok?
–No!

20:51.364 --> 20:52.615
You recognize somebody?

20:52.655 --> 20:53.428
No!

20:53.463 --> 20:55.413
Are you afraid? Which man is it?

20:55.453 --> 20:56.905
–I have to go!
–Where?

20:57.189 --> 20:58.047
I have to go!

20:58.136 --> 20:59.835
Oh, he has to go to the men's room.

20:59.875 --> 21:00.797
I have to go!

21:00.832 --> 21:01.983
I have to take him to the men's room.

21:02.023 --> 21:04.387
I don't have to pee. It's
2:00. I have piano lesson.

21:04.427 --> 21:06.365
Oh, Keith, you can't go
to your piano lesson today.

21:06.405 --> 21:08.538
It's 2:00. I have to
go to my piano lesson!

21:08.578 --> 21:09.487
I have to go!

21:09.730 --> 21:10.663
I have to go.

21:10.816 --> 21:12.157
You have to go.

21:15.938 --> 21:16.956
Where am I?

21:18.408 --> 21:19.794
Uh, you're in my car.

21:20.396 --> 21:21.589
Where am I?

21:21.774 --> 21:23.497
Uh, in the parking lot.

21:23.497 --> 21:24.769
Where am I?

21:24.944 --> 21:26.159
At the police station.

21:26.199 --> 21:27.207
Where am I?

21:27.392 --> 21:29.360
–Uh, in Los Angeles?
–Where am I?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.033
–I… I… I don't know.
–Where am I?

21:31.073 --> 21:32.449
I don't know. What's he pointing to?

21:32.489 --> 21:33.521
You want this?

21:33.521 --> 21:34.981
You want the GPS system?
Is that what you want?

21:35.021 --> 21:36.134
–Turn it on.
–Where am I?

21:36.174 --> 21:37.221
It's your car. How do you turn it on?

21:37.261 --> 21:38.400
I don't know. It's new.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.457
I don't know. Is there an ON button?

21:40.497 --> 21:42.026
That's helpful. Thank you.

21:42.066 --> 21:44.053
There it goes. Ok, ok.

21:44.205 --> 21:46.040
Temple Street and Los Angeles Street.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.728
North Spring Street, Los Angeles Street.

21:51.038 --> 21:52.915
You know where you are now, Keith?

21:52.955 --> 21:57.625
150 North Los Angeles Street,
Los Angeles, California, 90012.

22:00.936 --> 22:03.642
I'm going to be late
for my piano lesson.

22:04.498 --> 22:05.845
Piano lesson.

22:07.512 --> 22:09.507
Oh, god.

22:09.661 --> 22:14.827
6,7,8,9,10.

22:15.801 --> 22:17.223
Hey, where you been?

22:17.223 --> 22:18.798
Listening to the first 4 bars

22:18.838 --> 22:22.072
of the entertainer over
and over for a full hour.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.543
I took the kid to his piano lesson.

22:24.583 --> 22:26.787
Listen, I need you to
head over to the impound,

22:26.827 --> 22:28.543
check out the judge's car.

22:28.568 --> 22:30.292
S. I. D's already been over the car.

22:30.332 --> 22:33.752
No, I'm not looking for Forensics.
I want to know about the GPS system.

22:33.792 --> 22:36.035
12 paces by 14 paces.

22:36.248 --> 22:38.742
GPS system. Yeah.

22:38.902 --> 22:40.583
Um, heads up.

22:41.319 --> 22:43.958
Pope's looking for you
and not in a good way.

22:43.998 --> 22:47.124
Thanks. How long you think
it'll take you to get back to me?

22:47.164 --> 22:48.974
Uh, how's an hour and a half sound?

22:49.014 --> 22:51.425
4 paces by 6 paces.

22:54.699 --> 22:57.064
Like an eternity.

23:06.788 --> 23:09.133
That's all I had that was fresh.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.665
My dad is late.

23:27.447 --> 23:31.020
He was supposed to pick me up from
school. Does he know where I am?

23:31.060 --> 23:34.527
Keith, uh, didn't your mom tell
you anything about your dad?

23:34.567 --> 23:37.972
My mom lives in Phoenix.
33 North, 112 West.

23:39.028 --> 23:41.492
You live by yourself. You live alone.

23:42.195 --> 23:43.297
That's right.

23:48.405 --> 23:51.177
Have you ever visited
your mom in Phoenix?

23:51.611 --> 23:52.513
Yes.

23:52.548 --> 23:54.462
Did your dad drive you there?

23:54.470 --> 23:57.616
No. We flew in an airplane.

23:59.749 --> 24:01.193
My dad is late.

24:02.281 --> 24:07.244
Uh, Keith, your dad's not
gonna pick you up today.

24:07.845 --> 24:09.297
Do you understand why?

24:10.318 --> 24:12.298
The man with the gun shot him.

24:13.021 --> 24:17.622
That's right. Do you remember that?
Do you remember the man with the gun?

24:17.662 --> 24:19.774
I don't want to talk about that.

24:23.436 --> 24:26.604
But you do understand
what happened to your dad?

24:26.812 --> 24:28.435
Yes.

24:30.344 --> 24:32.284
My dad is dead like grandma.

24:32.485 --> 24:33.648
She's dead, too.

24:33.949 --> 24:36.391
So you don't get to see them anymore.

24:38.199 --> 24:39.107
No.

24:40.856 --> 24:42.916
–Where is it?
–Where's what?

24:44.326 --> 24:46.017
Where is dead?

25:07.371 --> 25:09.888
No. No. No…

25:10.189 --> 25:11.678
You need to take off that tie.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.595
What? Excuse me?

25:12.635 --> 25:14.076
Keith doesn't like the color red.

25:14.116 --> 25:15.432
Why is he still here?

25:15.472 --> 25:17.452
You need to take off your tie.

25:17.493 --> 25:19.962
I just got off the phone with his mother

25:20.002 --> 25:22.519
who stopped by his foster
home to see her son,

25:22.559 --> 25:24.803
only to find that he was not there

25:25.254 --> 25:26.703
and children services didn't know why.

25:26.743 --> 25:27.527
No!

25:37.037 --> 25:38.098
She's a little upset.

25:38.138 --> 25:40.940
I stopped by earlier this
morning, but there was no answer.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.709
I pulled in a big favor

25:43.209 --> 25:45.764
so that you could be
the one to transfer him.

25:45.804 --> 25:48.708
Now are you gonna charge
him with something?

25:51.050 --> 25:53.687
Then you better tell me you're
taking him right to his foster home.

25:53.727 --> 25:56.367
I'm taking him right to his foster home.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.241
GPS wasn't an option on a '94 Mercedes.

26:07.541 --> 26:09.653
This is an after-market upgrade.

26:10.065 --> 26:13.285
Usually, you only see a unit
like this on a high-end yacht.

26:13.325 --> 26:15.910
That would've been
right up Keith's alley.

26:15.950 --> 26:16.827
Why's that?

26:16.927 --> 26:18.693
Cause he's obsessed with geography.

26:18.733 --> 26:20.627
Always likes to know
exactly where he is.

26:20.667 --> 26:22.242
Well, that's what's so
great about this system.

26:22.282 --> 26:25.017
The judge had it set to
turn on automatically.

26:25.057 --> 26:26.334
So as soon as you start the car,

26:26.374 --> 26:28.821
a voice comes on and tells
you exactly where you are.

26:28.861 --> 26:30.907
That must be why he
freaked out in my car.

26:30.947 --> 26:32.413
Mine doesn't go on automatically.

26:32.453 --> 26:35.621
Hmm. But the coolest
thing is how precise it is.

26:35.711 --> 26:36.905
Tells you exactly where you are

26:36.945 --> 26:41.236
in longitude and latitude to
the thousandth of a degree.

26:41.436 --> 26:45.132
Ok, what's the longitude and
latitude of Mackey's house?

26:56.909 --> 26:59.268
34.113 North

26:59.468 --> 27:02.709
and 118.299 West.

27:04.234 --> 27:07.798
Uh, what about Griffith
Park? Where we found the body?

27:13.704 --> 27:16.827
34.132 North

27:18.328 --> 27:22.649
and 118.280 West.

27:23.450 --> 27:27.206
Is all of L. A. 34 North and 118 West?

27:27.306 --> 27:31.266
Most of it. A degree of longitude
or latitude is pretty big.

27:31.645 --> 27:35.158
Keith was only saying the
numbers after the decimal point.

27:35.198 --> 27:39.903
So 132 is really 34.132

27:40.103 --> 27:45.060
and 280 is really 118.280.

27:45.661 --> 27:46.646
Griffith Park.

27:46.946 --> 27:49.126
The carjacker would've
turned off the car

27:49.166 --> 27:50.528
to take the judge out to shoot him,

27:50.568 --> 27:52.049
and then when he turned the car back on,

27:52.089 --> 27:54.091
the GPS would announce automatically

27:54.131 --> 27:55.649
longitude and latitude.

27:55.704 --> 27:58.874
What about 124.266?

28:02.151 --> 28:05.334
I thought that would've
been the poker game, but…

28:05.374 --> 28:07.288
our killer made another stop.

28:13.866 --> 28:15.780
According to Keith's numbers,

28:16.049 --> 28:18.689
the carjacker stopped right around here.

28:20.952 --> 28:24.186
I can't believe our best
lead came from Rain Man.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.179
It was a joke. Come on.

28:26.275 --> 28:27.727
Is that what that was?

28:28.257 --> 28:30.830
Now why would someone
who just shot a judge

28:30.870 --> 28:36.149
and has an autistic teen locked in
the trunk of a stolen car come here?

28:36.737 --> 28:38.236
I don't know.

28:40.481 --> 28:42.061
But at times like this,

28:42.561 --> 28:46.008
I've always depended on
the paranoia of shopkeepers.

28:49.683 --> 28:53.262
3 of the shops have security
cameras that give us partial views.

28:53.302 --> 28:56.308
Now we got a few blind spots,
but we've basically got it.

28:56.348 --> 28:57.470
Ok, let's see it.

29:00.043 --> 29:03.002
Black Mercedes 300 SE.

29:03.503 --> 29:05.087
This is the judge's car.

29:06.707 --> 29:08.447
Which makes this…

29:11.350 --> 29:12.654
our man.

29:13.373 --> 29:16.615
Anyway, he was in there for
8 minutes and 20 seconds.

29:16.655 --> 29:18.635
Long enough for a stiff drink.

29:19.955 --> 29:21.473
Ok, let's freeze there.

29:22.316 --> 29:23.257
Blow it up.

29:25.104 --> 29:27.200
Could you make a copy of that, please?

29:27.240 --> 29:30.384
Everyone gets one. Robbery Homicide,
vice, your mother, everyone.

29:30.424 --> 29:32.536
Check it against our short list.

29:32.698 --> 29:34.481
Let's send someone
over to the bar, please,

29:34.521 --> 29:37.887
see if we can put a name
with this face. Thank you.

29:39.240 --> 29:40.582
Name's Jason Murphy.

29:40.682 --> 29:43.795
About a year and a half ago, we
busted his brother for carjacking.

29:43.835 --> 29:44.693
Third strike.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.026
Thompson gave him the
maximum sentence… life.

29:47.066 --> 29:49.741
Murphy insisted the whole
time his brother was innocent.

29:49.781 --> 29:52.651
Kind of flipped out at the
sentencing, tried to go after Thompson.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.018
–Any connection to Hoke?
–You can bet on it.

29:55.058 --> 29:56.186
Where do we find this Murphy?

29:56.226 --> 29:58.532
He moved to San Francisco 2 months ago.

29:58.572 --> 29:59.496
Move him back.

29:59.689 --> 30:00.811
Great. Thank you.

30:01.940 --> 30:03.037
Thank you.

30:04.439 --> 30:06.092
Is Keith here?

30:06.292 --> 30:08.326
I went to the foster home.
They didn't know where he was.

30:08.366 --> 30:09.391
Yes, he's here.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.205
Can I see him?

30:11.405 --> 30:12.989
I'm afraid not just yet.

30:13.142 --> 30:15.961
First, we need your son's help
in identifying the suspect.

30:16.001 --> 30:16.851
What?

30:16.951 --> 30:21.477
I don't really need your permission,
Jillian, but I was hoping for your support.

30:21.517 --> 30:22.443
Don't worry about Keith.

30:22.483 --> 30:24.261
He'll just be looking at a monitor.

30:24.301 --> 30:28.261
It's very important that we
make sure we have the right man.

30:28.734 --> 30:33.012
Just promise me that if he gets upset,

30:33.012 --> 30:34.376
you won't make him continue.

30:34.416 --> 30:35.160
I promise.

30:35.561 --> 30:36.970
Now you stay close by

30:37.170 --> 30:38.544
and check in in a couple hours.

30:38.584 --> 30:41.983
That'll give me some time to see if I
can't pull some strings at family court,

30:42.023 --> 30:44.597
maybe push up your custody hearing, ok?

30:45.142 --> 30:47.157
–Ok.
–Ok. Thank you.

30:50.163 --> 30:53.067
Ok, so some men are
gonna show up on the tv,

30:53.282 --> 30:55.971
and I want you to tell me if
you've seen any of them before.

30:56.011 --> 30:59.398
It'll be just like earlier, except this
time, the picture's will be on the screen.

30:59.438 --> 31:00.976
Go ahead.

31:19.928 --> 31:22.172
I believe we have a positive I. d.

31:41.723 --> 31:43.835
Excuse me, Deputy Chief Johnson,

31:44.532 --> 31:46.734
are we gonna interview
Murphy sometime today?

31:46.774 --> 31:49.394
Because some of us have
families, things we need to do.

31:49.434 --> 31:50.811
I'm not ready for him just yet.

31:50.851 --> 31:53.713
All right, look, we got a
partial print off the car.

31:53.753 --> 31:56.657
We got his blood by
the broken window glass.

31:57.188 --> 31:58.106
What are you waiting for?

31:58.146 --> 32:01.690
When we picked up Murphy in San
Francisco, he had $75,000 cash on him.

32:01.730 --> 32:03.779
Where'd he get that and why did
he stop at that intersection?

32:03.819 --> 32:05.305
I don't know. Maybe he
stopped to take a leak.

32:05.345 --> 32:06.717
Or maybe that's where he got paid.

32:06.757 --> 32:08.539
Ok, then, let's go ask him.

32:08.716 --> 32:10.655
If you don't mind, lieutenant,

32:10.695 --> 32:13.995
I like to have the answers
before I ask questions.

32:15.319 --> 32:17.110
Ok.

32:22.123 --> 32:25.846
Yeah, like I told the other guy,
he was in here on Wednesday night.

32:25.886 --> 32:27.078
Did you catch him yet?

32:27.118 --> 32:29.472
Did he talk to anybody
while he was in here?

32:29.512 --> 32:32.550
Nah, he just sat, had
a shot, and took off.

32:32.689 --> 32:33.882
You sure about that?

32:33.922 --> 32:35.636
Sure as I can be, I mean,

32:35.826 --> 32:37.730
we get pretty busy in here after 10:00,

32:37.770 --> 32:39.933
so he might have talked to someone.

32:39.973 --> 32:41.460
Sanchez…

32:41.630 --> 32:43.321
come here.

32:48.552 --> 32:49.756
Look.

32:49.922 --> 32:52.062
Condom machine. You got a quarter?

32:52.102 --> 32:54.362
Relax. Over there.

32:58.279 --> 33:01.579
Tao, we're gonna need a
phone dump on this number.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.887
Brenda, I am through
covering your ass for today.

33:06.927 --> 33:10.467
I've just spent way too long dealing
with a justifiably pissed off mother.

33:10.507 --> 33:12.061
You need to speak with this woman now.

33:12.101 --> 33:13.440
Hi, Will. I just found out

33:13.480 --> 33:15.330
that Jason Murphy made a
phone call Wednesday night

33:15.370 --> 33:17.233
about 20 minutes after the murder.

33:17.273 --> 33:19.333
Ok, good. Can you prove conspiracy?

33:19.373 --> 33:21.730
I'm just getting ready
to talk to him right now.

33:21.770 --> 33:24.412
Great. Terrific. There's just one
person I need you to speak with first.

33:24.452 --> 33:25.544
Who?

33:25.690 --> 33:27.350
Jillian, I owe you an apology.

33:27.390 --> 33:29.854
Sometimes I get so wrapped
up in my own investigation

33:29.894 --> 33:32.861
that I just have blinders
on to everything else.

33:32.901 --> 33:36.267
I understand. I have a
child with the same problem.

33:37.265 --> 33:38.295
Right.

33:38.448 --> 33:40.362
Uh, anyway, I have some good news,

33:40.402 --> 33:42.685
and that is that I spoke to
my friend at family court,

33:42.725 --> 33:45.012
and he's gonna shuffle
some things around

33:45.052 --> 33:46.594
and put you to the head of the line.

33:46.634 --> 33:48.339
Thank you. Thank you.

33:48.484 --> 33:49.843
How soon can I take Keith?

33:49.883 --> 33:51.347
Well, it should all
be settled by tonight.

33:51.387 --> 33:54.816
I just need you to fill out some
paperwork, and you can use my office.

33:54.856 --> 33:58.877
I forgot that the FBI's here today and
I told them that they could use my office.

33:58.917 --> 33:59.758
Shoot!

33:59.965 --> 34:01.789
Do you mind if I put you someplace else?

34:01.829 --> 34:03.677
–No.
–Ok. Thank you so much.

34:04.149 --> 34:05.852
I am so sorry.

34:06.058 --> 34:08.320
This is the only room that's available.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.388
Really, it's ok. I'm fine.
Whatever helps speed things along.

34:11.428 --> 34:13.880
Ok. So, um…

34:14.188 --> 34:16.725
I have an interview right now, but
as soon as the messenger arrives

34:16.764 --> 34:17.678
with the rest of your paperwork,

34:17.717 --> 34:21.571
I told sergeant Gabriel to come
and get me and I'll be all yours.

34:21.610 --> 34:22.931
Door open or closed?

34:23.402 --> 34:24.194
Open's fine.

34:24.376 --> 34:25.987
Open it is.

34:28.964 --> 34:30.219
Hi.

34:31.121 --> 34:33.090
My lawyer said not to talk to anybody.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.364
Really?

34:34.400 --> 34:36.630
Well, she'll be here in a few minutes.

34:36.670 --> 34:40.697
In the meantime, you don't have
to talk, you can just listen.

34:43.056 --> 34:48.156
Here is the story that the DA. is going
to tell the jury at your murder trial.

34:48.196 --> 34:51.864
You hated judge Thompson because
he put your brother away for life.

34:51.905 --> 34:55.172
So on Wednesday night, you
followed him to a poker game.

34:55.212 --> 34:55.989
You waited.

34:56.192 --> 34:57.776
You smoked 3 cigarettes,

34:57.837 --> 35:01.792
the filters of which are now as
rich in DNA as they are in nicotine.

35:01.832 --> 35:02.918
Are you following me?

35:02.958 --> 35:04.745
–No…
–shh shh shh.

35:05.116 --> 35:07.030
You then carjacked the judge,

35:07.142 --> 35:09.704
but were surprised to find his
15-year-old son in the backseat.

35:09.744 --> 35:12.407
You then forced the judge
to drive to Griffith Park,

35:12.447 --> 35:14.435
shot him twice.

35:14.843 --> 35:17.520
The kid freaked out so you stuck
him in the trunk of the car.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.916
That's how you got that cut on your lip.

35:19.956 --> 35:21.936
He doesn't like being touched.

35:22.031 --> 35:24.425
Then you stopped at the roost,

35:24.628 --> 35:27.202
made a phone call, drove to L. A. X.,

35:27.406 --> 35:29.084
left the kid in the trunk of the car,

35:29.124 --> 35:31.842
and headed home to San Francisco.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.098
Here's your flight manifest.

35:34.169 --> 35:35.584
Oh. Shh.

35:35.788 --> 35:40.404
3 parliament cigarettes equals lying
in wait, which equals death penalty.

35:40.444 --> 35:43.018
–Death…
–Please, Mr Murphy, don't talk.

35:43.441 --> 35:46.825
However, if someone hired
you, to kill the judge

35:46.992 --> 35:49.055
and you were willing to
tell me that person's name…

35:49.095 --> 35:50.823
oh, I shouldn't have said “tell.”

35:50.863 --> 35:52.183
I'm sorry. My fault.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.465
If you were willing to write down

35:54.505 --> 35:56.089
the name of that person…

35:57.123 --> 36:02.337
I guarantee you that the state of
California will not charge you for any crime.

36:25.478 --> 36:29.240
I'll confirm this information,
and then our deal is good.

36:31.271 --> 36:32.921
Let's get Hoke warmed up.

36:32.937 --> 36:37.271
I hope you've been paying attention, sergeant
Gabriel, she can teach you a thing or two.

36:37.311 --> 36:38.122
Yes, sir.

36:38.222 --> 36:42.249
About interrogation. I mean, don't
pay any attention to the other stuff.

36:42.289 --> 36:43.284
No, sir.

36:46.197 --> 36:49.271
So here's the rest of your paperwork.

36:49.371 --> 36:52.753
We just have to dot the
I's and cross the T's.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.152
Um, let's see.

36:55.852 --> 36:58.671
Here's some contact information.

36:58.771 --> 37:03.234
–Uh, is this still your permanent address?
–Yes.

37:03.288 --> 37:04.554
–And this your home phone?
–Yes.

37:04.594 --> 37:06.049
–And this your cell phone?
–No.

37:06.089 --> 37:10.035
Really? You didn't buy a prepaid cell
phone at Circle K in Tempe 2 weeks ago?

37:10.075 --> 37:11.257
No.

37:11.355 --> 37:12.678
Oh. Ok.

37:13.078 --> 37:17.104
Well, so the court's major
concern is your financial history,

37:17.500 --> 37:21.791
and apparently, you
recently withdrew $75,000

37:21.891 --> 37:25.257
all in increments under
$10,000. What was that for?

37:25.305 --> 37:29.878
I just bought a house and I'm fixing it up so
Keith can have his own room when he visits.

37:29.918 --> 37:32.116
Home improvements. Ok.

37:34.462 --> 37:36.904
And how long have you known this man?

37:38.061 --> 37:39.399
I've never seen him before.

37:39.439 --> 37:44.389
Really? Then why did he call you 20
minutes after he murdered your husband?

37:46.190 --> 37:49.218
I… I don't think
I should say any more.

38:02.549 --> 38:03.682
These are the Kaufmans.

38:03.722 --> 38:06.098
They have 3 foster children already,

38:06.158 --> 38:09.197
and they live in this 4
–bedroom house in Echo Park.

38:09.237 --> 38:13.114
34.123 north latitude,
118.342 east longitude.

38:13.305 --> 38:18.231
Do those numbers mean anything to
you? Because yesterday you had no idea.

38:19.248 --> 38:20.898
Anyway, one of their kids

38:21.655 --> 38:23.742
was just busted recently
for selling drugs.

38:23.782 --> 38:26.290
Keith will be sharing a room with him.

38:27.930 --> 38:29.844
Why are you doing this to me?

38:29.922 --> 38:32.058
And this is the Sloane group home.

38:32.098 --> 38:34.342
They have a $50 million endowment.

38:34.776 --> 38:37.774
They specialize in taking care
of children with special needs.

38:37.814 --> 38:41.774
They also have 2 on-site
occupational therapists for autism.

38:44.292 --> 38:45.102
What do you want from me?

38:45.142 --> 38:47.163
–I want you to choose.
–Choose what?

38:47.203 --> 38:49.776
Where Keith will be living
while you're in prison.

38:49.816 --> 38:53.261
–This is crazy. I don't…
–and this is Jason Murphy's handwriting.

38:53.301 --> 38:58.647
I asked him who paid him to kill the
judge, and he wrote down “Jillian Thompson.”

38:59.016 --> 39:03.573
Now's the time in the interview
where I read you your rights.

39:03.793 --> 39:06.169
You have the right to remain silent.

39:08.912 --> 39:11.235
in a court of law. You have
the right to an attorney…

39:11.275 --> 39:12.482
did you turn that on?

39:12.522 --> 39:13.644
No, that was her.

39:13.745 --> 39:15.791
Do you understand these rights?

39:17.569 --> 39:22.915
Now, you can either get an attorney and
I'll go straight to children services or,

39:22.957 --> 39:25.409
we can keep talking and
you tell me the truth.

39:25.449 --> 39:29.871
Lie to me one more time, and you
can kiss the Sloane house goodbye.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.284
Michael was hurting Keith.

39:51.483 --> 39:56.169
He was trying to force him to be a
regular kid. He's not a regular kid.

39:57.790 --> 40:01.882
Do you have any idea how brutal
the children in his class are?

40:02.448 --> 40:04.021
How much they ridicule him?

40:04.061 --> 40:05.249
Kids can be cruel.

40:05.352 --> 40:07.266
How do you know Jason Murphy?

40:08.841 --> 40:11.490
He called the house once.
He threatened Michael.

40:11.530 --> 40:13.908
So you knew he wouldn't
be morally opposed

40:13.948 --> 40:18.529
to murdering your husband and
you offered him $75,000 to do it.

40:20.715 --> 40:21.483
Yes.

40:22.866 --> 40:25.336
Why did Murphy call
you later that night?

40:25.376 --> 40:26.234
He was upset.

40:26.686 --> 40:28.455
Keith wasn't supposed to be in the car.

40:28.495 --> 40:31.334
He wanted more money before
he would tell me where he was.

40:31.374 --> 40:35.399
So when you called judge Thompson's cell
phone, you knew that the police would answer

40:35.439 --> 40:38.937
and you'd have an excuse
to come to L. A. to pay him.

40:40.786 --> 40:43.159
You are a piece of work.

40:44.784 --> 40:46.824
Michael was a son of a bitch.

40:48.439 --> 40:50.617
He didn't care about Keith or me.

40:50.833 --> 40:52.351
He cared about winning.

40:53.274 --> 40:56.284
He got to every divorce lawyer in town.

40:56.684 --> 41:00.050
No one would represent me.
I didn't stand a chance.

41:01.982 --> 41:03.302
You're not a mother.

41:04.217 --> 41:06.272
You don't know how it feels.

41:08.122 --> 41:10.102
I had to sit in that courtroom

41:10.258 --> 41:13.497
and hear them tell me that I wasn't fit

41:13.806 --> 41:17.284
to raise… my own child…

41:19.382 --> 41:23.871
the child that I gave birth to.

41:26.409 --> 41:29.211
When Michael took away Keith…

41:30.339 --> 41:32.513
he took away my life.

41:43.644 --> 41:45.802
I guess now we're even.

41:50.735 --> 41:51.488
Hi.

41:51.788 --> 41:55.673
You told me he was being held in west
L. A. I was in traffic for 2 hours.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.476
Did I say that? Oh, I'm so sorry.

41:58.776 --> 42:00.246
I've been so scattered today.

42:00.286 --> 42:03.520
Um, but don't worry, Mr
Murphy didn't say a word,

42:03.537 --> 42:06.930
and, like I promised, I'm not
gonna charge you with anything.

42:06.970 --> 42:09.380
Um, do I get to keep the 75 grand?

42:09.580 --> 42:10.504
Sure. Why not?

42:11.375 --> 42:13.023
My client is free to go?

42:13.422 --> 42:16.099
Well, uh, no. Um, not exactly.

42:20.457 --> 42:22.524
This is special agent Howard.

42:22.724 --> 42:25.737
Um, he works with the FBI,

42:26.137 --> 42:29.881
and, um, we happen to be dating.

42:34.831 --> 42:37.225
Now I said I wasn't gonna charge
you with anything and I won't,

42:37.265 --> 42:39.131
but, um, there's a new law

42:39.231 --> 42:41.454
making carjacking a federal offense,

42:41.494 --> 42:44.383
and I believe it has the
death penalty attached to it.

42:44.423 --> 42:47.987
Mr Howard here will fill
you in on all the details.

42:48.287 --> 42:51.059
Thank you again so
much for all your help.

42:55.372 --> 42:57.550
I never get tired of saying this.

42:57.842 --> 42:59.446
You have the right to remain silent.

42:59.486 --> 43:03.974
Anything you say can or may be used
against you in the court of law.

43:10.906 --> 43:12.047
Where am I?

43:12.279 --> 43:14.390
Where am I? Where am I?

43:14.697 --> 43:15.813
Where are you taking him⁈

43:15.853 --> 43:18.124
They're taking him to Sloane
house, Brenda, like we agreed.

43:18.164 --> 43:19.882
–What⁈ Now?
–Yes.

43:27.334 --> 56:00.619
Where am I?
