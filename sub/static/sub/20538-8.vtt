[indistinct radio chatter]

01:30.173 --> 01:31.967
[Blanca] And you said it wouldn't work.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.471
The man is the size of a refrigerator.

01:36.554 --> 01:39.016
- He'll never fit through that hole.
- That's what she said.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.392
- [phone ringing]
- [both gasping]

01:40.475 --> 01:42.102
It's him. But it's not him.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.354
[Blanca] Oh, it's like Chewbacca
without hair.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.735
"Can't talk.

01:49.818 --> 01:55.658
Enter through basement vent at sundown.

01:55.741 --> 01:57.367
Let's kill them all."

01:57.450 --> 02:00.162
- No, wait. Are you crazy?
- Mmm-mmm.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.405
We'll never be ready by then.

02:01.454 --> 02:02.599
- We haven't even figured out...
- Shh!

02:02.623 --> 02:03.666
a way to trap him.

02:03.749 --> 02:05.626
[grunts] <i>Rojita,</i>
we're gonna booby trap him,

02:05.709 --> 02:07.711
like in <i>Mi Pobre Angelito,</i> you know?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.253
[Red breathes heavily]

02:09.336 --> 02:11.440
You haven't seen that movie,
where the parents go on vacation

02:11.464 --> 02:14.551
and they forget about their kid and
he has to defend himself against burglars?

02:14.635 --> 02:16.053
[sighs] You mean <i>Home Alone.</i>

02:16.970 --> 02:18.889
- No.
- Well, why are we even talking about this?

02:18.972 --> 02:22.434
Piscatella's not the kind of man
who slips on marbles.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.353
On ice. They slip on ice in the movie.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.731
We need to kick him
[grunts] in the back of the neck.

02:27.815 --> 02:31.151
Maybe we can do that paint can thing.
Or the tarantula.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.862
[scoffs] Like you can jump high enough
to get him on the neck.

02:33.946 --> 02:38.450
- I would knock him down first.
- With what? I'll tell you with what.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.576
Paint can!

02:41.036 --> 02:42.806
- How long you been a reporter?
- [indistinct chatter]

02:42.830 --> 02:44.164
Hmm, couple years.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
- Hmm.
- It's very brave work.

02:45.958 --> 02:48.335
- Absolutely.
- Officer Moloney.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.688
I'd like a word with you, please.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.272
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- In private.

02:51.296 --> 02:55.300
- I thought you left, Officer...
- Piscatella. I would never leave my men.

03:00.347 --> 03:01.348
Listen...

03:02.265 --> 03:06.729
I've been in contact with one of my COs
on the inside. CO Humphrey.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.564
He tells me
they are mounting an offensive.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.817
Now, I know a way to breach, undetected...

03:11.900 --> 03:15.112
I'm gonna stop you right there,
Officer, uh... uh...

03:15.738 --> 03:18.073
- Piscatella.
- Right. [chuckles] Why's that so hard?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.241
[chuckles]

03:19.324 --> 03:22.619
Look, my men and I could
stamp this thing out in five minutes,

03:22.702 --> 03:24.180
but the governor's orders
are to negotiate.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.332
We cannot reward inmates
for this kind of behavior.

03:27.415 --> 03:28.959
Maybe. Maybe not.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.754
But it sure as shit
ain't your call to make, Piscarella.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.591
Tella. Pisca... tella.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.136
You got a nickname or something?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.430
Actually, never mind. Don't care.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.226
Slap the fucking punk.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.685
[inmates chattering]

03:48.937 --> 03:50.856
[Zirconia] I'm liking the clean shave.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.608
You could slice those cheeks up
real thin, like pastrami.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.736
Right amount of fat in 'em.

03:56.737 --> 03:57.780
What are we talking about?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.697
You never wonder
what people would taste like?

03:59.782 --> 04:01.491
Uh, no.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.761
Takes me about three days of hungry

04:02.785 --> 04:04.953
before I start thinkin' 'bout
how to cook people.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.597
You had, like, eight bags of Takis today.

04:06.621 --> 04:08.832
Empty calories.
This body needs protein.

04:09.541 --> 04:12.544
I mean, we could be negotiating
with, like, Susan Sarandon or something.

04:12.627 --> 04:16.298
The governor is not going to send
an actress to negotiate a prison deal.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.673
She's an actrivist.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.509
Don't mean she'll set foot
in this shithole.

04:19.591 --> 04:22.053
He's probably gonna send
some kind of a human rights attorney.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.806
Like that guy from Attica?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.307
William Kunstler is dead.

04:25.390 --> 04:27.684
Like all the good people in this world.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.644
I meant his type.

04:29.727 --> 04:30.872
[Taystee] Look, it don't matter
who they send.

04:30.896 --> 04:33.816
All that matters is
we show 'em who we are.

04:33.899 --> 04:38.403
That we better than all this shit.
Though I wouldn't mind Mr. Lee.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.405
- I dig his movies.
- Also dead.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.075
You know, they say
that whole family is cursed.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.493
Not Bruce. Spike.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.830
<i>Crooklyn</i> makes me cry like a baby.

04:47.913 --> 04:48.997
Who the hell is that?

04:49.832 --> 04:51.893
[Zirconia] I don't know,
but she look tough and tasty,

04:51.917 --> 04:53.293
like turkey jerky.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.214
Hey, we got a live one.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.509
- Oh!
- [Piper] Serious.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.594
You letting me in?

05:02.677 --> 05:06.849
Or are we supposed to negotiate
like we're at a 7-Eleven after hours?

05:06.932 --> 05:09.226
Man. Open the doors.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.111
Sorry, Po-Po.
We don't wanna catch swine flu.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.696
- Wait outside the doors.
- [officer] But, ma'am, I can't...

05:21.779 --> 05:24.574
It's fine. I come in peace, right?

05:24.657 --> 05:26.368
I'll be right out here if you need me.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.537
- [Fig] Thank you.
- Right this way, Ms. Figueroa.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.039
[Fig] Nice legs.

05:31.123 --> 05:35.335
I see they've looted all the razors
from commissary.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.755
Nah, I shaved this morning.
This just my afternoon shadow.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.716
[sighs] So, what do you think?

05:41.799 --> 05:43.676
I think it's a really bad idea.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.887
I meant the hair.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.805
Oh, Bill, come on,
don't be such a wet rag.

05:47.890 --> 05:52.019
Can't we just enjoy the fact
that I'm back?

05:52.102 --> 05:55.230
- [sighs]
- I missed you. Come here.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.876
You know how pissed the cops are gonna be

05:57.900 --> 06:00.818
when they see you on television
before you've given them a statement?

06:00.903 --> 06:02.862
Honey, the only point
of giving an exclusive

06:02.946 --> 06:05.698
is so you can tell your story
to a worldwide audience

06:05.782 --> 06:07.617
before you tell it to anybody else.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.928
Don't think that's how the law works.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.272
- [Judy scoffs]
- [knocking on door]

06:11.204 --> 06:13.081
- We're ready for you, Ms. King.
- Ah! Finally!

06:13.165 --> 06:16.084
All right,
time to bathe in a little limelight.

06:16.168 --> 06:18.211
Wash off the stink of that terrible place.

06:18.295 --> 06:19.629
[indistinct chatter]

06:19.712 --> 06:21.965
Meredith... darling! [chuckles]

06:22.049 --> 06:24.717
Judy, it is so good to see you.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.013
You have no idea what a relief it was
to hear that you'd been released safely.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.847
Oh, Lord, it was terrible.

06:29.932 --> 06:32.225
I can't even begin to tell you.
Those women?

06:32.309 --> 06:34.852
[Aleida] Look.
It's the princess of prison.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.522
Yo! This little mic thing
is diggin' into my tit. I'm moving it.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.317
Can you still hear me okay?
'Cause I got lots to say.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.670
I... I didn't realize that there was
gonna be another guest.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.172
- Didn't my assistant fill you in?
- [Judy] Mmm-mmm.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.198
The segment is called "Riot Girls."

06:46.281 --> 06:50.994
Although, I'm still pitching
for "Litchfield of Dreams."

06:51.078 --> 06:54.957
[woman] We're on in
ten, nine, eight, seven...

06:55.623 --> 06:58.501
[in Spanish]
I'm telling you, this where it's at.

06:58.585 --> 07:03.173
- Hot food, stars at night...
- This ain't hot.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.299
Shit, it's barely food.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.444
Told you we shouldna' traded
all our candy for those nunchucks.

07:06.468 --> 07:09.471
Woulda been fine if you hadn't let
someone steal our animal crackers.

07:11.181 --> 07:12.765
Why you suddenly so high on starting

07:12.849 --> 07:15.101
a revolt against
the revolt you started anyway?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.185
[Pidge] Hmm.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.897
My extra time never went through.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.985
Slow paperwork or some shit.

07:23.068 --> 07:26.113
I could get home while
my kid's still pissing in diapers.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.366
So I'm not risking more years to be
part of some hope and change bullshit.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.659
It ain't bullshit.
They're negotiating in there.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.036
[Maria in English] <i>Ay!</i> Come on.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.747
That yellow brick road
ain't leading no place but Max.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.125
The stars, ladies...

07:39.292 --> 07:40.585
I'm telling you.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.046
Bigger the star, shorter the life.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.632
I learned that before
a planetarium laser show one time.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.760
Hey.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.471
Are you using anything edible
to make your colors?

07:51.554 --> 07:53.056
Anything you can spare?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.933
[Dayanara] I think I got some Tang left.

07:56.018 --> 07:57.269
Anything chewable?

07:57.352 --> 07:59.187
I don't know.
Make some Tang sandwiches.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.813
- That sounds not good.
- No?

08:00.897 --> 08:04.484
What did you get after school?
Blended kale and Chia Pets?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.446
More like advice on how to starve myself.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.077
Must be nice,
having an outlet for all your shit.

08:14.161 --> 08:17.830
- So much shit.
- So much shit. Hmm.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.250
God, who knew having a conscience
would be such a bummer?

08:21.043 --> 08:22.127
What do you mean?

08:26.589 --> 08:27.965
Do you ever have it where, like...

08:28.883 --> 08:32.345
'cause of the guilt,
you just feel sick all the time?

08:33.388 --> 08:35.722
[stutters] Like, nauseous almost?

08:35.807 --> 08:38.809
I got a lot of emotions
about what happened,

08:38.893 --> 08:40.102
but guilt ain't one of them.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.604
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.448
Even the whole
bullet in the guard situation?

08:44.857 --> 08:49.362
You know what? I'm sick of you
and everyone putting that shit on me.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.906
If Humps hadn't brought that gun in here
and been such a dick,

08:51.989 --> 08:54.909
maybe he'd still have two good legs
to be kicking us around with.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.954
- All right?
- Okay.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.374
My bad for trying to locate remorse
on your morality map.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.542
[scoffs]

09:02.625 --> 09:04.728
All right, you continue painting
and I'll go back to not assuming

09:04.752 --> 09:06.713
- that everyone has a conscience.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.215
It is prison, after all.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.179
You nerds going to Eddy's thing Saturday?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.473
- Ugh. I hate reggaeton.
- Shit, Daya,

09:16.556 --> 09:18.100
you got any Puerto Rican in you?

09:18.183 --> 09:20.560
Sounds fun. I'd go.

09:21.186 --> 09:22.186
Damn it.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.356
Man, that still had
one puff left in it at least.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.276
Happy now?

09:28.360 --> 09:31.404
Like a baby bird
being fed by its mama. [blows]

09:36.451 --> 09:37.660
Oh, shit.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.079
You guys see that?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.129
Oh, my God. Is he dead?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.338
We gotta call the cops.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.821
Are you kidding?
We're high as fuck.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.472
- What are you doing?
- Scared?

09:58.931 --> 09:59.974
Daya, don't.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.562
- [yells and laughs]
- [screams] What the hell?

10:04.646 --> 10:05.647
[laughing]

10:09.692 --> 10:11.611
You ain't met Ronny from 302?

10:11.694 --> 10:13.405
He does props for, like, movies and shit.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.924
Probably just drying out
some corpse he drowned on <i>Law & Order.</i>

10:15.948 --> 10:18.493
- You're an asshole.
- Come on, Claire. This is bullshit.

10:19.369 --> 10:20.745
Later, nerds.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.041
So, uh... you flirting with Paolo?

10:25.125 --> 10:28.461
Hell, no. Puerto Rican guys are too loud
and they always late and shit.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.463
- You're always late.
- [both chuckle]

10:30.547 --> 10:31.923
Exactly. Why?

10:32.006 --> 10:33.633
Are you into him or something?

10:33.716 --> 10:35.051
Yeah. I think I am.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.305
Like, I wanna go for him.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.473
Nice. All yours.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.285
But you better make sure
he don't make your period late.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.602
Puerto Ricans guys don't like rubbers.

10:44.686 --> 10:48.315
Well, according to my sister,
neither do the Irish, the Italians,

10:48.398 --> 10:53.153
plain white dudes, black dudes,
French dudes, Koreans...

10:53.236 --> 10:54.904
Your sister real slutty?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.614
Nah. She works at the free clinic.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.616
[both chuckle]

10:58.700 --> 11:02.412
Tell Doctor Velasco
that this is the third time I'm calling.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.414
I need to speak to him, please,
about my son.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.041
Benny Mendoza, room 621.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.227
[nurse on phone] <i>Like I said, ma'am,</i>

11:08.251 --> 11:12.046
<i>Doctor Velasco will keep your son's
legal guardian informed of any updates...</i>

11:12.129 --> 11:14.382
Legal guardian?
I'm his mother, <i>carajo.</i>

11:14.466 --> 11:17.719
Put him on the fucking phone.
I'm the one that gets the updates.

11:17.802 --> 11:21.681
<i>You care so much, come in here
and ask Doctor Velasco yourself.</i>

11:21.764 --> 11:23.308
[grunts] Oh, I will.

11:23.391 --> 11:27.604
But right now, it's not that easy, right?
Because I'm in prison, okay?

11:27.687 --> 11:29.123
But you better believe
that when I get out,

11:29.147 --> 11:32.150
you are the first bitch
that I am gonna go find.

11:32.400 --> 11:36.821
[grunts] <i>Hold... hold for a moment.</i>
<i>I'll see if he's available.</i> [chuckles]

11:41.826 --> 11:45.037
[Nicky] Yo, you might be better off
with, uh, an anti-psychotic.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.416
If you give me the keys,
I'll get you some.

11:51.419 --> 11:55.923
You know what? Just 'cause you dressed up
like a trashy Audrey Hepburn

11:56.007 --> 11:58.593
doesn't mean you can be
such a bitch, okay?

11:58.676 --> 12:00.720
I am feeling very sensitive right now.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.805
Aw. Mmm.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.393
How about you go find somebody else
to be your warm fuzzy place, okay?

12:06.476 --> 12:07.602
I'm out of that business.

12:09.812 --> 12:13.775
I am not letting you kick me
out of this place. I like it.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.859
[chuckles]

12:14.942 --> 12:17.779
Besides, there are laws against it.
I am pregnant.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.947
There is nothing in your womb

12:20.031 --> 12:23.910
except for a deep psychosis
wrapped in a uterine lining.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.662
So keys, now.

12:26.329 --> 12:27.872
Oh, Nicky. Thank God.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.917
I need needles. Ten of them.

12:31.000 --> 12:34.296
- I don't have time to explain.
- Hairless Chewbacca is coming.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.715
All right. What the fuck are you guys on?
I am not enabling here.

12:37.799 --> 12:41.553
Don't be ridiculous. The needles
are for sticking under fingernails,

12:41.636 --> 12:42.970
not into veins.

12:43.054 --> 12:46.098
[gasps] Although, maybe we should
shoot him up with something.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.436
What is that stuff they use in the movies
to make the spies weak and talky?

12:49.519 --> 12:51.228
Breasts.

12:51.313 --> 12:55.567
Look, why don't you guys come in here
and then we can strategize.

12:55.650 --> 12:56.984
There's no time.

12:57.068 --> 12:59.404
Uh... quickly.
We'll sagetize very, very quickly.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.072
[Nicky] So fast.
[Lorna] Come on.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.365
[cries and sniffs]

13:03.282 --> 13:04.923
- Oh, for God's sake...
- [Nicky] Calm down.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.713
Hey. You can't lock me in here.
<i>Loca mierda.</i>

13:06.786 --> 13:07.888
I don't like what you just called me.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.097
Even though I don't know what it means.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.416
- Come on, Nicky.
- What is this? What is this?

13:11.499 --> 13:12.500
What? Is this an...

13:12.584 --> 13:15.587
So it's actual human flesh
attached to a pencil? Oh, good.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.880
What the fuck, Red?
What did you give her?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.591
Hey, I'm no pusher.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.860
We make our own adult decisions,
me and the mad Russian.

13:21.884 --> 13:24.554
- They're vitamins.
- Yeah.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.263
- See?
- Oh, yeah?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.934
Fucking shit. [laughs] Oh, yeah.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.229
Do your vitamins usually have
an identification number on them?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.022
It's pharmaceutical-grade speed.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.875
The bottle says vitamins.
Who am I to question?

13:36.899 --> 13:38.360
So if I just take a shit in a can

13:38.443 --> 13:40.123
and I label it "chili,"
you gonna eat that?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.113
God, that is a horrible image.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.408
What? I should have known better.
Or maybe I did know and I did it anyway.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.701
But Nicky, this is important.

13:46.784 --> 13:51.122
We're so close to getting Piscatella
inside and proving he's a murderer.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.833
Why don't we table this conversation
until you come down

13:53.916 --> 13:55.377
and start making some sense?

13:55.460 --> 14:00.006
Piscatella killed an inmate
at his last prison.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.718
We are luring him inside
to get a signed confession.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.889
And then we are going to show
the whole world what he did.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.601
Uh-huh. So you are, uh,
luring him in here?

14:11.684 --> 14:15.021
[stutters] We're even doing Humps' voice
and everything. Yeah?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.690
Fuck. What the fuck, Red?

14:17.774 --> 14:20.568
All right, do you wanna get us all killed?

14:20.652 --> 14:22.069
- [sighs]
- Huh?

14:23.195 --> 14:24.196
[indistinct chatter]

14:33.039 --> 14:34.707
Hey.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.419
What do you call someone
who ain't doing their community service?

14:37.502 --> 14:39.421
I'd say that's violating probation.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.006
See? Probation.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.593
Pronation is when you're really positive
about the country,

14:45.677 --> 14:48.805
or, like, when your feet go out.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.366
Yeah, well, nothing would have went out.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.726
People would have been perfectly happy
with their desirable beverages

14:53.810 --> 14:56.563
if two shitbags I know
didn't piss in my yellow drink.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.440
Ow! My finger.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.775
- What'd you do?
- I didn't fucking touch her.

15:01.776 --> 15:05.780
My shot-off finger started to hurt
the second she got close to it.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.324
Oh, like ghost pains?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.659
Tell her to stay away from me.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.995
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave
while Leanne uses the shower.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.082
Well, I wasn't plannin' on pissin'
in the shower today, so. [chuckles]

15:16.165 --> 15:17.875
You're not listening to me.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.836
This is a Penn-free zone now.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.839
Means you gotta stay 300 feet away
from Leanne at all times.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.317
Well, I don't see no motherfucking judge
to sign off on that one.

15:25.341 --> 15:29.011
The justice system didn't do its job,
so we're doing it.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.453
- [sing-song] See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya.
- [chuckles]

15:35.477 --> 15:37.353
Okay.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.482
Now, we're gonna play a game
called Circle Jerk.

15:42.859 --> 15:44.861
Raise your hand if you've ever played.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.321
Circle... Jerk?

15:47.404 --> 15:51.283
Like where guys sit around
in a circle and...

15:51.367 --> 15:54.161
Stroke each other's backs.

15:54.245 --> 15:57.289
The first one to get tired is the jerk.

15:57.373 --> 15:58.934
Yep. That's definitely how I've played it.

15:58.958 --> 15:59.958
Thank God.

16:07.592 --> 16:11.137
This is, uh... surprisingly
not as terrifying as I thought.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.889
Uh, agree to disagree.

16:12.972 --> 16:18.520
Whoa! The secret is using a gentle,
feather-like motion.

16:21.523 --> 16:25.234
My cousins and I, we used to practice
during summer vacations in Wichita

16:25.317 --> 16:27.779
until Meemaw found us
and said we were headed

16:27.862 --> 16:31.616
towards a fiery lake of burning sulfur,
by which she meant hell.

16:33.576 --> 16:34.577
But...

16:35.369 --> 16:38.748
maybe that was because
my cousin Hunter's penis was out.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.963
[sucks teeth] Ugh. Man,
I'm sick of season recaps.

16:46.047 --> 16:49.341
Like sniffin' a bag of Doritos
and not bein' able to snack strong.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.011
- Don't talk about food. I'm starving.
- [typing]

16:53.137 --> 16:55.139
You sure you don't have any more candy?

16:55.222 --> 16:56.473
Am I sure?

16:56.558 --> 16:59.393
Why you think I'm lying here so quiet?

16:59.476 --> 17:01.896
Trying to preserve my energy. Shit.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.065
[sighs]

17:04.147 --> 17:05.608
[phone chimes]

17:05.692 --> 17:08.444
Oh. Negotiations are starting.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.865
Ooh. Who they send?
Queen Bey?

17:12.949 --> 17:16.452
I mean, 'cause she'd wrap
this shit up in, like, two sequins flat.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.454
Some lady named Figueroa.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.623
What? Damn.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.387
Man, that White Walker gonna eat us alive.

17:22.458 --> 17:23.858
And she won't gain a pound neither.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.627
Come on, let's go.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.678
Uh, yeah.
Who's gonna watch the Insane Clown Posse?

17:35.471 --> 17:38.641
All right, Duck, Duck, Goose over.
We taking our hostages back.

17:38.725 --> 17:43.646
No. No, wait. We didn't even get to play
Left Foot Art yet.

17:43.730 --> 17:45.064
[Black Cindy] Ladies, ladies...

17:50.570 --> 17:51.654
If you keep 'em here

17:51.738 --> 17:54.198
till Suzanne gets tired,
that's half a Twix,

17:54.281 --> 17:58.410
and another half if you put her crazy ass
to bed by 8:00. [clicks tongue]

17:59.954 --> 18:01.998
I thought you said
you didn't have any more candy.

18:02.081 --> 18:06.252
You don't break the glass
unless it's an emergency.

18:06.335 --> 18:09.922
You wanna know why I said yes
when the governor asked me to do this?

18:10.006 --> 18:12.383
Because I read this list and I thought

18:12.466 --> 18:17.096
this is clear and forward thinking
and has the potential to effect change.

18:17.179 --> 18:18.973
Real change.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.725
And I want to be part of that.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.019
So I am here to help.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.436
Yeah, what's the catch?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.898
Thank you, Ms. Figueroa.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.626
I know we're gonna
do some real good work here.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.692
[Fig] Agreed.

18:29.776 --> 18:33.237
But you have to help me help you.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.174
- You're gonna have to give a little.
- [Black Cindy] See? See? There it is.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.243
- Always a catch.
- As eloquent as these demands are,

18:39.326 --> 18:44.165
they completely fail to take into account
our current economic climate.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.043
The BOP's private prison budget
is restrictive

18:47.126 --> 18:51.255
and far too complex for me
to explain to you here, but trust me,

18:51.338 --> 18:55.677
it definitively prohibits us
from meeting all of these demands.

18:55.760 --> 18:59.555
- Please.
- However... let's focus on the positives.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.183
See what we can do.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.351
Yeah.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.689
Let's focus on the positive.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.109
[inmates cheer]

19:12.193 --> 19:15.947
Ah! Go to church, T.
Hit 'em with that hallelujah.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.282
See, I got my own stack of paper,
Ms. Figueroa.

19:18.365 --> 19:21.368
- [Black Cindy] Come on, T.
- And I'm positive... [chuckles]

19:21.452 --> 19:26.958
that a simple rebalancing
of MCC's... complex budget

19:27.041 --> 19:29.460
- be enough to finance all of our demands.
- Ms. Jefferson...

19:29.543 --> 19:30.646
- [Alison] Tell her, T.
- [Black Cindy] Mmm-hmm.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.921
We got the Internet now.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.881
[sing-song] World Wide Web.

19:33.965 --> 19:37.134
And Mr. Caputo's files.
We know what you know.

19:37.218 --> 19:40.763
And we know that MCC's
been spending 20% less per inmate

19:40.847 --> 19:42.473
than the federal government did.

19:42.556 --> 19:47.061
We also know that MCC's CEO
been making bank off our backs.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.690
Like, $3.4 million-in-bonuses bank.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.649
And that's only talking last year.

19:52.734 --> 19:56.195
So the money is there, Ms. Figueroa.
We know it.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.822
- We know it.
- [Taystee] You know it.

19:57.905 --> 19:58.945
[Black Cindy] You know it.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.367
The question is,
what are we gonna do about it?

20:01.450 --> 20:04.411
- [sing song] What you gon' do about it?
- [inmates cheering]

20:04.495 --> 20:07.039
- [Black Cindy] Mmm-hmm.
- Yes! That's my girl. Whoo!

20:07.123 --> 20:08.624
You go, girl.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.919
We're gonna work on that.

20:12.003 --> 20:13.004
[indistinct chatter]

20:17.674 --> 20:18.843
How you holding up in there?

20:20.427 --> 20:21.888
Fan-fucking-tastic.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.266
You got a cigarette?

20:26.392 --> 20:28.102
I didn't know you smoked.

20:28.185 --> 20:30.687
Anything to mask the smell.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.566
Thank you. Thank you.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.577
I got a favor to ask.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.414
You think I'm in a position
to grant favors?

20:49.581 --> 20:50.666
I need furlough.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.169
[chuckles] Please, don't make me laugh.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.105
I don't want to breathe
any harder than I have to.

20:55.129 --> 20:57.673
I know how it sounds, but I'm serious.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.467
I gotta get out, Mr. Caputo.

21:01.635 --> 21:05.014
- I need a miracle.
- That makes two of us.

21:06.515 --> 21:10.853
Uh, my boy, Benny... he's in ICU.

21:11.437 --> 21:15.357
Got himself... jumped by some thugs.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.193
Dislocated his jaw.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.197
[scoffs] Knocked out most of his teeth.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.577
He hasn't woken up yet.

21:27.745 --> 21:33.042
Doctor says that he, um,
he got a hematoma on his brain.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.836
Shit.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.379
Mendoza, I'm sorry.

21:42.927 --> 21:47.098
You know, Benny's teeth didn't even
come in till after he was one?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.392
[chuckles]

21:50.476 --> 21:55.147
Um... the pictures
from his first birthday, all gums.

21:56.482 --> 22:00.777
We had to mush up his, uh, Barney cake.

22:01.988 --> 22:05.491
And then when his teeth finally came in,
they came in all at once.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.784
One behind the other.

22:07.869 --> 22:11.455
I swear, that... that kid
didn't sleep for six months.

22:12.581 --> 22:14.959
Hell, I didn't sleep for six months.

22:26.595 --> 22:28.097
What if, um...

22:29.098 --> 22:31.767
What if he gets up and I'm not there?

22:33.560 --> 22:38.524
What if he doesn't
and I'm here, man? I'm here.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.776
Smelling other people's shit.

22:47.033 --> 22:50.161
I can't do anything from in here.
You know that.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.956
- Maybe if you let me out...
- What?

22:54.040 --> 22:57.293
And get myself jumped
by all those crazy bitches out there?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.920
Unless you can guarantee me

22:59.003 --> 23:01.505
that I'm gonna end up
in the same ICU as Benny,

23:01.588 --> 23:03.507
I don't see what good that's gonna do me.

23:05.301 --> 23:07.219
Please, Mr. Caputo.

23:07.303 --> 23:12.099
Some of us have actually been trying
to do good during all this shit.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.311
[sighs]

23:17.688 --> 23:21.483
If you can make it to my office,
press three on the office phone.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.195
Maybe somebody there
can do something for you.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.073
But Mendoza, help is not free.

23:27.156 --> 23:30.659
You want out?
You're gonna have to help end this thing.

23:35.831 --> 23:36.999
So, ladies, let me ask you:

23:37.083 --> 23:40.669
What do you think inspired this sudden
movement for change inside Litchfield?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.921
Movement? It's a damn riot.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.048
Well, Meredith,

23:44.131 --> 23:47.759
I think this is all happening on the heels
of losing one of our young inmates,

23:47.843 --> 23:49.428
Ms. Poussey Washington.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.973
Such an enormous loss.

23:52.056 --> 23:57.103
She was my mentee, you know. I...
Well, more than that, she was my friend.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.229
Judy, I'm sorry.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.481
- That must be devastating for you...
- [Aleida] For her?

24:00.564 --> 24:02.285
This ain't about one person,
living or dead.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.318
This is about all of us.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.088
And what they're doing to us
while we in there.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.654
And what they ain't doing.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.615
- Mmm.
- We need some education,

24:09.698 --> 24:12.284
some rehabilitation,
but we ain't getting nothing

24:12.368 --> 24:14.370
'cause they want us to fail out here.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.621
Those prison companies?

24:15.704 --> 24:17.581
They want us to keep going back in

24:17.664 --> 24:19.642
because we the easiest product
for them to restock.

24:19.666 --> 24:23.504
No, no. Ms. Diaz is right.
Those private prisons are awful.

24:23.587 --> 24:26.215
Uh, the food,
guards always frisking us up...

24:26.298 --> 24:28.759
Oh, please, ain't no guard
ever touched you.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.737
'Cept for that doughy one
that smelled like weed.

24:30.761 --> 24:32.471
But you liked that, didn't you?

24:32.554 --> 24:34.555
- [Judy] Well, I would never...
- [Aleida] Oh, please!

24:34.598 --> 24:36.868
Don't act like you ain't busy giving up
that wrinkled piece of ass

24:36.892 --> 24:39.603
every chance you got.
Bitches saw him leaving your room.

24:39.686 --> 24:41.647
- Ms. Diaz, please...
- Yeah, that's right. Her room.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.191
As in, with a door
and Chesterfield cookies

24:44.275 --> 24:46.985
and people hand-plucking
her leg hairs and shit.

24:47.069 --> 24:48.195
What? Uh, Meredith,

24:48.279 --> 24:50.531
this woman has no idea
what she's talking about.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.159
She left the prison
before the riot even started.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.577
I was the one who witnessed the shooting.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.663
I can still hear it ringing in my ears.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.331
Did you say there was a shooting?

25:01.833 --> 25:04.586
Oh. Well, it... it was awful.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.505
I... I was standing no more
than two feet away

25:06.588 --> 25:10.176
when an inmate came up
and shot one of the guards in cold blood.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.136
I believe his name was Humphrey.

25:12.219 --> 25:15.556
I... Well, now I don't know whether
that was his first name or his last name.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.433
I... It could go either way.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.202
Can you give us any more details
about the incident?

25:19.226 --> 25:23.564
Well, I don't remember the name
of the inmate who shot him.

25:23.647 --> 25:25.941
Well, you might know her, Ms. Diaz.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.527
That Spanish girl
that doesn't speak Spanish?

25:29.111 --> 25:31.905
You know, one with the puffy lips.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.534
Mmm?

25:36.743 --> 25:39.871
- This CO who was shot, CO Humphrey.
- Mmm-hmm?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.349
<i>- Did he survive?</i>
- [indistinct chatter]

25:41.373 --> 25:45.377
<i>Well, yes, but the last time I saw him
he could barely speak.</i>

25:45.461 --> 25:48.214
<i>I'm afraid he is facing
quite a long recovery.</i>

25:48.297 --> 25:50.257
[Meredith] <i>Well, this is all</i>
<i>extremely shocking.</i>

25:50.341 --> 25:52.718
<i>- We're gonna take a break...</i>
- Humphrey.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.304
Wasn't that the CO
you were in contact with?

25:55.387 --> 25:58.599
Uh, must have been one of
my other COs using his phone.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.559
[chuckles] Right.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.771
- Wait, Officer, uh...
- Piscatella.

26:04.271 --> 26:06.607
This was part of your plan, right?

26:08.525 --> 26:12.238
Storm in there
and decoupage them into submission?

26:12.321 --> 26:15.616
[laughs] It's freaking awesome.
Where did you find that?

26:15.699 --> 26:17.868
My wife. Big on Pinterest.

26:17.951 --> 26:19.870
[both continue laughing]

26:22.164 --> 26:23.165
[indistinct chatter]

26:24.583 --> 26:26.752
[Maria] Mendoza, you all right?

26:26.835 --> 26:29.838
Come have some food. You're looking
paler than Elvira over here.

26:29.921 --> 26:32.216
If you think that's an insult,
you're wrong.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.510
No, thank you.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.220
Maritza, if you're gonna have food,

26:36.303 --> 26:38.156
you gotta put it on the table
for everybody to share.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.366
[Maritza] What? That's bullshit.

26:39.390 --> 26:42.309
- Socialism is what it is.
- Yeah, stop turning this into Cuba.

26:42.393 --> 26:46.188
Oh, I'll turn it into fucking Guantánamo,
unless you put that bottle down.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.941
Whatever. We didn't want to join
your revolution anyway.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.027
Everybody knows
that Che was just overcompensating

26:52.110 --> 26:53.791
'cause he couldn't
grow enough facial hair.

26:54.571 --> 26:56.591
[Judy over speaker]
<i>I believe his name was Humphrey.</i>

26:56.615 --> 26:57.699
Oh, fuck.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.994
You guys, look, Aleida's on TV.
Against Judy King.

27:01.077 --> 27:03.348
[Meredith] <i>Can you give us</i>
<i>any more details about the incident?</i>

27:03.372 --> 27:06.917
<i>Well, I don't remember the name
of the inmate who shot him.</i>

27:07.000 --> 27:09.044
<i>Well, you might know her, Ms. Diaz.</i>

27:09.127 --> 27:11.505
<i>That Spanish girl
that doesn't speak Spanish?</i>

27:11.588 --> 27:14.550
- [gasps] Oh, shit.
<i>- You know, one with the puffy lips.</i>

27:14.633 --> 27:17.136
[Meredith]
<i>This CO who was shot, CO Humphrey...</i>

27:17.219 --> 27:19.012
All right. That's just easy math.

27:19.095 --> 27:21.640
It's only a matter of time
before they come in here to get her.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.434
Then what? You gonna hand her in?

27:23.517 --> 27:26.228
No. I'm in no position
to judge what she did, trust me.

27:26.312 --> 27:27.312
[cell phone ringing]

27:27.354 --> 27:28.790
[Meredith] <i>This is all extremely shocking.</i>

27:28.814 --> 27:31.042
<i>We're gonna take a break,
then we'll be back with more of "Riot...</i>

27:31.066 --> 27:32.901
[Maria] Someone's got to tell her.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.278
I got it.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.655
This is so sad.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.907
I know.
It's like when Van Gogh cut off his ear.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.076
How is it anything like that?

27:41.159 --> 27:44.079
I don't know.
It's the only sad artist story I know.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.456
[sighs]

27:46.748 --> 27:50.377
- What am I gonna do?
- You're gonna talk to your mother.

27:50.461 --> 27:51.670
Come on. Deal with your life.

27:51.753 --> 27:53.565
You always say that I'm not
your mother, and you're right.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.258
I'm somebody else's mother
and I got to go deal with that.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.884
Fuck her. I don't wanna talk to her.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.737
You think I wanna talk to her
after she fucked up my life?

27:59.761 --> 28:02.681
Aleida's a piece of work, but this?
This ain't on her.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.576
If she hadn't been trying
to get famous out there,

28:04.600 --> 28:06.035
then that food bitch
wouldn't have said anything.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.811
You think this shit
was gonna stay a secret?

28:07.894 --> 28:09.771
And you a mother now, too.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.749
You think that means
that you always make the right choice?

28:11.773 --> 28:13.835
Because from where I'm standing,
you sure don't look like it.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.068
[sighs]

28:16.862 --> 28:19.030
Gloria, what was I supposed to do?

28:19.114 --> 28:21.175
The gun fell in front of me.
Everybody was screaming.

28:21.199 --> 28:22.701
He was acting like a fucking prick.

28:22.784 --> 28:24.536
Oh! So he made you shoot him?

28:24.620 --> 28:27.706
No, it was those bitches.
No, it was your mother and those bitches.

28:27.789 --> 28:28.832
She made you do it,

28:28.915 --> 28:30.917
and everything else
that's fucked up in your life.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.002
Huh? Right?

28:32.085 --> 28:34.045
Where were you
when all this was going on, huh?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.565
That gun may have landed in front of you,

28:35.589 --> 28:37.567
but it was your finger
that pulled that damn trigger.

28:37.591 --> 28:38.675
You did that.

28:39.260 --> 28:40.552
You did that!

28:41.845 --> 28:42.846
[sobs]

28:45.474 --> 28:47.142
[Dayanara whimpers softly]

28:49.060 --> 28:50.521
Look... [sighs]

28:50.604 --> 28:52.356
[scoffs]

28:52.439 --> 28:56.693
And I know that sometimes our only choices
are between shitty and shittier,

28:56.777 --> 28:59.780
but whatever we end up doing,
we gotta own it.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.866
Somehow find grace in it.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.330
Come on.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.505
The bodega was out of the wing ones,
so I got you the extra-long.

29:17.506 --> 29:18.507
Thanks.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.468
That guy that works there,
what's his name?

29:21.552 --> 29:24.012
- Paolo?
- He asked about you.

29:25.472 --> 29:27.516
That's not embarrassing at all.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.685
- Why? You like him or something?
- No.

29:30.644 --> 29:33.355
'Cause I think
he got a little crush on you.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.940
We're friends. I known him forever.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.143
- [Aleida] Mmm.
- [smacks lips]

29:36.191 --> 29:38.610
Well, your friend got manners.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.529
Introducing himself to your mother?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.449
That's the kind of guy that's gonna
open car doors for you and shit.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.451
Good thing I can open my own doors.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.329
What? You trying to tell me you ain't
into that dimple of his? Please.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.246
Claire likes him, okay?

29:50.331 --> 29:52.123
So? That means you can't like him?

29:52.207 --> 29:55.001
I didn't see no flag planted in his ass.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.963
That <i>blanquita</i> is bland.
Like french fries with no salt.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.090
[stammers] She's my friend.

30:01.216 --> 30:04.553
She ain't gonna get no <i>boricua.</i>
Be your own friend.

30:05.554 --> 30:09.391
- [sighs]
- Daya, you got to look out for yourself.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.518
Otherwise,
you ain't gonna get shit in life.

30:12.478 --> 30:13.479
You hear me?

30:18.233 --> 30:20.276
Of course the guards will be replaced.

30:20.361 --> 30:22.988
It's not like any of them
will want to come back here anyway.

30:23.071 --> 30:25.324
[Taystee] It ain't enough
to just replace 'em.

30:25.407 --> 30:29.453
How do we know they won't be bringing
the same type of mess back in here again?

30:29.536 --> 30:32.623
The new guards need to be like
the ones we used to have.

30:32.706 --> 30:35.125
- You mean fat and lazy?
- I mean trained.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.127
- And human.
- Human.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.170
Except for that one guard
with the mustache.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.255
Hey, what was his name?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.066
- I think it was Spanish or something.
- [cell phone rings]

30:42.090 --> 30:43.174
- Pornstache.
- Yeah.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.427
- [inmates] Pornstache.
- One second. Yeah.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.447
- [exclaims excitedly]
- [Taystee] Yes.

30:47.471 --> 30:49.431
- Four down, six to go.
- [shushes softly]

30:49.515 --> 30:51.517
T, you was killing the motherfucking game!

30:51.600 --> 30:52.643
Yes!

30:52.726 --> 30:53.852
[Black Cindy] Son!

30:53.935 --> 30:56.855
Miss Jefferson,
I've just been informed a CO was shot

30:56.938 --> 30:59.400
and injured by an inmate.
You neglected to mention that.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.777
- Ms. Figueroa...
- Even if the governor

31:01.860 --> 31:03.737
decides to continue
with these negotiations,

31:03.820 --> 31:06.573
and that's a big "if,"
amnesty is definitely off the table.

31:06.657 --> 31:07.741
Wait. What?

31:07.824 --> 31:10.160
You claimed there was no violence.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.870
We said there was no casualties.

31:11.953 --> 31:14.039
People can't go around
shooting guards with impunity.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.248
Sends a bad message.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.043
- [grunts]
- [Brook] They're bluffing.

31:18.126 --> 31:19.727
They want us to turn against each other.

31:19.753 --> 31:22.548
But the second we start splintering,
they gain the upper hand.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.550
No. Why should we pay
for what one person did?

31:24.633 --> 31:26.134
I say we hand her in.

31:26.217 --> 31:28.136
A classic deontological dilemma.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.806
The train experiment?

31:30.889 --> 31:31.973
Anybody?

31:32.057 --> 31:33.778
- Mmm-mmm.
- [Taystee] Nope. The fuck is that?

31:34.726 --> 31:35.727
Okay.

31:35.811 --> 31:38.897
A train is coming and you see
five people are tied to the track.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.941
But you don't have time to untie them,

31:41.024 --> 31:44.570
but if you pull a lever,
the train will go to a side track.

31:44.653 --> 31:47.573
Problem is,
there's also a person tied to that track.

31:48.699 --> 31:52.202
A person you will knowingly kill
because of your actions.

31:52.285 --> 31:54.431
So, do you let the train continue
and do you kill five,

31:54.455 --> 31:55.848
or do you pull the lever and you kill one?

31:55.872 --> 31:59.835
Do you value the right and wrong
of actions themselves,

31:59.918 --> 32:04.840
or do you value the right and wrong
of the consequences of those actions?

32:06.007 --> 32:07.008
I pull the lever.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.446
Damn, girl. You didn't even
think about that one for a second.

32:09.470 --> 32:11.221
I got a daughter to go home to.

32:11.304 --> 32:13.515
She's utilitarian. I'd pull it, too.

32:13.599 --> 32:14.975
No. We can't let them divide us.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.645
We want justice for Poussey or not?

32:18.729 --> 32:20.105
- [Piper] Mmm.
- [Janae] Yes.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.817
[sighs] Stay.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.652
We're gonna go get somebody.

32:27.571 --> 32:29.072
[Piper] Come on.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.247
[Stratman grunting and banging on wall]

32:37.330 --> 32:40.000
Hey. Since when do these lines
get so long out here?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.936
Since a third of the prison population
moved outside

32:41.960 --> 32:44.420
and two of the porta-potties
are being used as jails.

32:44.505 --> 32:45.945
Plus, the Ghetto bathroom overflowed

32:46.006 --> 32:47.775
and people are making hooch
in the Suburb toilets.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.469
[sighs] I don't know if I can wait
that much longer, you know.

32:50.552 --> 32:52.679
Just visualize closing your urethra.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.765
Close your urethra.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.031
- I am.
- [Stratman] Fuck! Fuck, that! Fuck!

32:57.100 --> 32:59.853
- Come on! Let me out!
- [Dwight shushes]

32:59.936 --> 33:01.437
Get me the fuck out.

33:01.522 --> 33:04.399
Don't cry. You're not alone.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.236
And you have abs like a chocolate bar
that I'd lick in my dreams.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.946
Do you want me to sing you a song?

33:10.030 --> 33:13.033
No. Just get me the fuck out of here!

33:13.116 --> 33:15.118
- [yells and groans]
- [inmates exclaiming]

33:15.201 --> 33:16.327
[all laughing]

33:16.411 --> 33:17.597
[Stratman grunting and banging on wall]

33:17.621 --> 33:18.997
[Dwight] My nose!

33:19.080 --> 33:20.499
- Go.
- Go.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.507
Piss elsewhere.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.008
[scoffs] Move.

33:32.969 --> 33:36.056
- [Stratman] Get me the fuck out of here!
- [Leanne] Hmm.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.356
[urinating]

33:45.440 --> 33:46.441
[sighs]

33:57.410 --> 33:58.912
Back the fuck away.

33:58.995 --> 34:03.667
You back away, you hall-pissing,
guard-loving, finger-shooting hillbilly.

34:03.750 --> 34:07.003
[chuckles] Aw.
Didn't your mommy potty train you?

34:07.087 --> 34:08.088
[Leanne] Careful, Ang.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.882
You don't know what kind of diseases
she got from that guard.

34:10.966 --> 34:13.552
She probably has chlamydia chowder
all over her underwear.

34:13.635 --> 34:14.636
[chuckles] Good one.

34:15.344 --> 34:17.723
Keep lookin' and you're gonna find me...

34:18.514 --> 34:19.641
I swear.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.018
Face looks weird.

34:23.143 --> 34:25.313
Doesn't her face look weird?

34:25.396 --> 34:27.523
Come on. This hallway reeks.

34:34.280 --> 34:36.449
<i>Coño,</i> he's coming
and we ain't got no booby traps.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.827
Okay. Can you relax please?
I'll get him to back off.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.054
I'm kind of good at this shit.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.413
[Blanca] Open the fucking door
or I'm gonna dig into

34:42.496 --> 34:44.666
those flat little tits of yours
and get the key myself!

34:44.750 --> 34:49.129
Okay. For your information, these titties
are fuller than they've ever been.

34:49.212 --> 34:51.047
Although they are very painful.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.233
And you are a pain in my ass.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.967
Why don't you just
get the fuck out of here?

34:55.051 --> 34:57.053
- [panting]
- Okay. No, not you!

34:57.137 --> 34:58.471
Flores is right.

34:58.554 --> 35:01.391
There's no stopping him.
He'll burn this place to the ground.

35:01.474 --> 35:03.351
[clears throat] Relax. Right?

35:03.434 --> 35:07.022
Concrete don't burn.
Lorna's taking care of it, all right?

35:07.105 --> 35:09.024
You're okay.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.507
You know, you just feel like this
'cause it's Suicide Sunday.

35:12.152 --> 35:13.444
[whispers] It's Sunday?

35:13.528 --> 35:14.529
[Lorna chuckles]

35:14.613 --> 35:15.947
My God.

35:16.031 --> 35:17.741
How long has this riot lasted?

35:17.824 --> 35:20.702
[Nicky] Suicide Sunday.
Not real Sunday.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.329
That's when you've been high for too long.

35:23.413 --> 35:27.959
Friday, Saturday, life's just a,
uh, rush of possibility, you know?

35:28.043 --> 35:32.047
Maybe you even feel like you're not such
a worthless piece of shit for a minute.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.758
And then Sunday comes along.

35:34.841 --> 35:37.427
And your heart is like
a jackhammer on your brain

35:37.510 --> 35:39.930
and you realize that none of it was real.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.641
[softly] And you want
to claw your eyes out.

35:42.724 --> 35:45.977
This is just, uh, part of the ride.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.854
Is this what it's like for you, Nicky?

35:48.772 --> 35:51.232
Uh, less so now. Uh...

35:51.316 --> 35:54.485
I have spent a lot of time
in this neck of the woods, Red.

35:54.569 --> 35:55.862
Oh, I'm sorry.

35:57.238 --> 36:00.826
We do fucked-up things
when we're fucked up, right?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.618
It's par for the course.

36:02.703 --> 36:04.079
Be angry with me.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.747
I am not feeling it, Red.

36:05.831 --> 36:10.752
And this pharmaceutical stumble is
evoking more compassion than rage.

36:11.712 --> 36:14.089
- Like, maybe even a tiny bit of mirth.
- Oh.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.858
[chuckles] All right?
But I'm trying to keep a lid on it.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.175
- [Red sniffles]
- Oh!

36:17.258 --> 36:18.259
Oh, I did it!

36:18.343 --> 36:22.013
"Standing down.
Staying posted for the next go-ahead."

36:26.101 --> 36:29.730
See that, Red?
There's, uh, nothing to worry about.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.899
[indistinct chatter]

36:32.983 --> 36:34.609
Hey! Ladies, can I help you?

36:34.693 --> 36:36.277
- Where's Diaz?
- Not here.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.964
- Yo, we ain't fucking around.
- Neither are we.

36:37.988 --> 36:39.948
- [Piper] Alex.
- What's going on, Pipes?

36:40.031 --> 36:42.492
Pulling the lever.
Diaz needs to turn herself in.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.037
Or riot amnesty is off the table
for everyone.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.250
We're sacrificing the one for the many.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.586
And what's the difference
between her and me?

36:56.172 --> 36:57.298
[scoffs]

37:05.681 --> 37:07.058
[sighs] Hey.

37:07.142 --> 37:10.103
[Aleida] <i>You shot a motherfucking guard</i>
<i>and you gonna "hey" me?</i>

37:10.186 --> 37:12.022
What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:12.105 --> 37:13.982
<i>Everything, apparently.</i>

37:14.065 --> 37:15.776
Where'd you get a goddamn gun?

37:15.859 --> 37:17.579
I don't know.
He brought it. That Humps guy.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.237
You're humping the guard?

37:19.320 --> 37:20.923
What is with you and guard fucking?
Jesus!

37:20.947 --> 37:22.949
<i>No. No, Hump is his name.</i>

37:23.033 --> 37:24.385
I wouldn't fuck that crazy asshole.

37:24.409 --> 37:26.929
He's the one that was doing
all that fucked-up shit to everyone.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.915
- So, it was self-defense.
<i>- No.</i>

37:29.998 --> 37:32.751
He was on the ground
with his hands in the air and...

37:32.834 --> 37:36.087
there were, like,
50 people that could've grabbed him.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.422
But then...

37:38.506 --> 37:40.341
[sighs] I shot him.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.929
<i>I didn't think it was a big deal.
It was just his leg.</i>

37:44.012 --> 37:47.182
He was fine at first.
But I don't know what happened.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.893
Now he can't move or talk.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.478
Good. That's good.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.897
How is that good?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.981
Here's what you're gonna do.
You're gonna tell them

37:56.024 --> 37:58.252
he brought the gun in before
and put that shit in your mouth

37:58.276 --> 38:01.237
and threatened to blow your head off
because he's a fucking psycho.

38:01.321 --> 38:02.781
Nobody's gonna believe that.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.866
<i>It's your word against a Brussels sprout.</i>

38:06.076 --> 38:08.912
- Brussels sprout?
- Pick another vegetable! Whatever!

38:08.995 --> 38:11.915
The point is, he's dead in the head
and can't defend himself.

38:11.998 --> 38:12.999
But you still can.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.459
Just please, stop already.

38:14.542 --> 38:16.502
You got to stop being a manatee, Daya.

38:16.586 --> 38:19.047
<i>Just floating around,
watching the world go by you</i>

38:19.130 --> 38:24.552
with your big eyes, waiting for the boat
to ram its propeller into your head!

38:24.635 --> 38:26.221
You got to be the shark.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.098
No, you're the shark, Ma.

38:28.181 --> 38:29.902
But that don't mean
I'm the fucking manatee.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.104
[upbeat music playing]

38:41.111 --> 38:42.112
What up?

39:02.215 --> 39:03.895
Knew you had that <i>boricua</i>
in you somewhere.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.307
Yo, Claire, wait up.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.768
What are you doing?

39:14.853 --> 39:16.413
Daya, I've known you
since the first grade.

39:16.437 --> 39:18.916
If something was gonna happen between us,
it would've happened by now.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.441
Don't you think?

39:20.525 --> 39:22.126
I'm into Claire.
I thought you knew that.

39:32.287 --> 39:35.123
I like Diaz and all, but we can't all
go down for what she did.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.392
[Pidge] You can't pull the lever.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.752
You got to let fate take its course,
or it comes back to haunt you.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.731
Fuck that. You got to grab fate
by the balls and make it do what you want.

39:42.755 --> 39:43.882
For real.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.176
[Pidge sighs] All right.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.554
I know what I want.

39:49.637 --> 39:51.389
I can't make it do anything.

39:52.598 --> 39:56.436
[in Spanish] We could zip-tie him
to the bed and do a mustache rodeo.

39:56.519 --> 40:00.023
Or prop his dick up
with some popsicle sticks and duct tape.

40:02.483 --> 40:03.484
Okay, um...

40:04.069 --> 40:08.198
so according to my Italian,
they're either going to ride my horse

40:08.281 --> 40:09.865
or eat ice cream on me.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.733
I'm wagering that you're
the ice cream in this scenario.

40:14.204 --> 40:16.015
[in Spanish]
What if we put something up his ass?

40:16.039 --> 40:19.209
You know if you tickle his prostate right,
you get a rise out of him.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.962
- Mmm.
- Or we make him watch porn.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.046
[in English] Yeah.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.842
What kind of porn you like?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.010
What?

40:29.094 --> 40:30.334
Doesn't look good for you, man.

40:31.137 --> 40:32.722
Aw, look at you. Oh...

40:33.556 --> 40:37.435
I bet your meat's all tender and juicy
like them baby cows in Japan

40:37.518 --> 40:39.604
that drink beer and get massaged and shit.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.872
- [both chuckle]
- [Luschek chuckles nervously]

40:40.896 --> 40:44.234
Hey, you don't want my meat.
[stutters] I never get massages.

40:44.317 --> 40:45.357
Ain't your meat I'm after.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.613
I want that bone you pop
when you're scared.

40:51.074 --> 40:52.200
[softly] Ow. Ah!

40:52.283 --> 40:54.660
What? I ain't scary enough for you?

40:54.744 --> 40:57.122
Uh, no, you're terrifying.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.625
Uh, really. Your teeth, especially.

41:01.876 --> 41:06.131
Uh, but I have a long refractory period
following ejaculation.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.259
So, um... it'll at least be a few hours.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.013
You came in the bubble?

41:14.180 --> 41:17.225
- When?
- I'm subtle.

41:17.308 --> 41:20.936
And, uh, I was already wet with pee.

41:21.021 --> 41:22.647
So it was easier to hide.

41:25.066 --> 41:28.069
I know a few things we can do
while we wait, though.

41:31.781 --> 41:33.074
The fuck?

41:33.908 --> 41:36.077
He doesn't seem to be enjoying this game.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.704
And Meemaw says you don't
touch private parts in public,

41:38.788 --> 41:39.830
even if we are family.

41:40.665 --> 41:41.916
All right, yo! Fuck! Enough!

41:42.000 --> 41:44.335
Man, fuck that half a Twix.
We takin' our guards back.

41:44.419 --> 41:46.254
Wait! Wait!

41:46.337 --> 41:48.798
No. Five minutes. Look. No, three.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.966
No, ten. Oh, no.

41:51.051 --> 41:52.611
[Pidge] Hey.
Go find somebody else to play with.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.095
What happened to your friend, huh?

41:54.179 --> 41:55.697
The one that looks
like Sloth from <i>Goonies?</i>

41:55.721 --> 41:57.307
No, I hate sloths!

41:57.390 --> 41:59.475
They only urinate and defecate
once a week,

41:59.559 --> 42:01.977
and they have to do it
in the same place every time.

42:02.062 --> 42:04.689
Huge Darwinian disadvantage.

42:04.772 --> 42:07.067
Oh, please. I could go with you.
I'll be good.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.794
- See? Look, I'll be good.
- Fuck, dude. God damn!

42:08.818 --> 42:11.279
Got a cousin like this, man.
She's all fun and loopy,

42:11.362 --> 42:14.449
until she stab you in the thigh
with your eighth grade karate trophy.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.825
- Get the...
- Oh, fuck that!

42:15.908 --> 42:16.968
[Suzanne] Come... Oh, please.

42:16.992 --> 42:18.328
[in Spanish] Tie her to the bunk.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.870
[Suzanne] No. No!

42:19.954 --> 42:21.456
- [Ouija] <i>Vamo.</i>
- Stop that! Please!

42:21.539 --> 42:23.249
Help! Help!

42:23.333 --> 42:24.875
No. Don't.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.836
No. No!

42:26.919 --> 42:27.962
[grunting]

42:28.046 --> 42:29.648
Come on, you... you don't have to do that.

42:29.672 --> 42:32.800
Yeah, I don't have
to kick your ass either, but keep talkin'.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.844
[Suzanne bawling]

42:34.927 --> 42:36.971
No, don't do this!

42:37.055 --> 42:40.141
- Go.
- [Suzanne] Please!

42:41.726 --> 42:42.727
[shudders]

42:43.394 --> 42:44.854
Hey, Boo.

42:44.937 --> 42:49.024
- Let me talk to you.
- Uh, I'm a little busy right now.

42:49.109 --> 42:52.153
Yeah, I can see that.
But I don't think you understand, okay?

42:52.237 --> 42:56.031
I'm being fuck... I'm being persecuted.
Like Jesus.

42:56.116 --> 42:58.618
They won't even let me go
to the fucking bathroom, dude.

42:58.701 --> 43:00.161
I just had to piss in the hallway.

43:01.036 --> 43:03.789
Let me tell you something,
tile is not like grass.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.708
It splashed back up on me.

43:05.791 --> 43:07.001
Ew, gross.

43:07.918 --> 43:11.214
I'm so sorry. I just have, like,
weird associations with pee.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.549
- It's a long story.
- Okay.

43:16.094 --> 43:18.239
Look, kid, I know.
I'm sorry you're having some issues.

43:18.263 --> 43:21.141
But you're just gonna need
to find somebody else

43:21.224 --> 43:23.934
- to help you unravel this drama, okay?
- What?

43:24.018 --> 43:26.146
- Boo, you're my best friend.
- I know.

43:26.229 --> 43:30.691
And we will continue digging into
that incredibly deep shit well of yours...

43:30.775 --> 43:32.503
- [scoffs]
- uh, as soon as I'm done getting laid,

43:32.527 --> 43:33.903
like, seven or eight more times.

43:33.986 --> 43:35.363
- Mmm-hmm.
- Come on.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.990
I'm having feelings, girl.

43:38.073 --> 43:40.535
You know, like,
I think I might actually be in love.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.663
[whispers] I got to get her addicted
to my pheromones.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.457
Uh, we got a meth problem.

43:47.708 --> 43:51.629
Uh, my finger.
It's... it's hurting again.

43:51.712 --> 43:53.839
Looks like someone needs
to vacate the premises.

43:53.923 --> 43:55.883
Yeah, no problem.
Was thinking the same thing.

43:55.966 --> 43:57.968
- [Angie grunts]
- [inmates exclaiming]

43:58.052 --> 44:00.180
[Leanne] Get her off!
[Big Boo] Pennsatucky!

44:00.263 --> 44:01.389
[all clamoring]

44:01.472 --> 44:03.933
- [Leanne] Get off her!
- Pennsatucky!

44:04.016 --> 44:05.893
Oh-ho-ho! [panting]

44:05.976 --> 44:08.354
Maybe now you'll listen!

44:08.438 --> 44:09.855
You can't rehab a monster!

44:09.939 --> 44:11.708
She needs to be locked up
for everyone's safety!

44:11.732 --> 44:12.876
No, I don't! It's not even fair!

44:12.900 --> 44:16.111
You guys fucking terrorize me
every single day!

44:16.196 --> 44:17.363
I can't even take a piss?

44:17.447 --> 44:19.574
I told you!
I told you you would find me.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.451
- You broke my fucking nose!
- Good!

44:21.534 --> 44:24.134
First, she mutilates my finger,
now she's breaking people's noses?

44:24.162 --> 44:25.413
Lock her up!

44:25.496 --> 44:28.166
[inmates chanting] Poo! Poo! Poo!

44:28.249 --> 44:33.128
[all chanting] Poo! Poo! Poo!
Poo! Poo! Poo!

44:53.816 --> 44:54.984
[grunts]

44:56.986 --> 44:58.238
[yells]

44:58.321 --> 44:59.489
- [grunts]
- [thuds]

45:00.155 --> 45:01.657
[groaning]

45:04.577 --> 45:05.703
<i>Coño.</i>

45:05.786 --> 45:07.330
- [door closes]
- [TV playing]

45:08.456 --> 45:10.500
Hey, don't leave your shit lying there.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.793
- [Dayanara] Shut up. Leave me alone.
- [door slams]

45:14.754 --> 45:16.046
[Cesar] There she go.

45:16.130 --> 45:20.593
I hope that, for her sake,
your sister jumped out the window.

45:20.676 --> 45:23.220
Go ahead.
Talk to me like that again.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.475
[softly] Aw, fuck.

45:28.809 --> 45:29.810
Is this about the fish?

45:29.894 --> 45:33.314
'Cause I told your sister to clean
the damn tank after she put glitter in it.

45:33.398 --> 45:35.691
I think she wanted
to turn him into a mermaid.

45:35.775 --> 45:37.610
Merman. Whatever.

45:39.529 --> 45:41.739
There isn't a single thing
you don't ruin, is there?

45:42.782 --> 45:44.033
It ain't about the fish.

45:46.786 --> 45:47.953
[sighs]

45:49.747 --> 45:51.582
What is it? You can tell me.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.918
Claire won't talk to me.

45:54.001 --> 45:55.437
Paolo's too embarrassed
to even look at me.

45:55.461 --> 45:57.188
And I had to pretend
I got detention during lunch

45:57.212 --> 45:58.813
'cause I didn't have no one to sit with.

45:59.131 --> 46:00.132
That's it?

46:00.925 --> 46:01.967
Shit.

46:02.051 --> 46:04.804
I thought that pervert PE teacher
with the glasses touched you again.

46:06.806 --> 46:08.558
Bitches come and go.

46:08.641 --> 46:10.893
That's why they're called bitches,
not lap dogs.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.270
I did not want her to go.

46:14.522 --> 46:15.749
I don't know why I listen to you.

46:15.773 --> 46:18.943
Leave me alone. Go away.

46:20.903 --> 46:22.447
Oh, I'm going.

46:22.530 --> 46:24.657
But I'm not gonna get back till late.

46:24.740 --> 46:25.908
So feed the kids!

46:26.701 --> 46:28.411
- [door slams]
- [toy jingling]

46:31.121 --> 46:34.417
[automated voice] <i>I will now connect you</i>
<i>to the number you requested.</i>

46:36.043 --> 46:38.546
- [Delia] <i>Hello?</i>
- Ms. Powell?

46:38.629 --> 46:40.214
<i>- Yes?</i>
- It's Dayanara.

46:40.297 --> 46:41.549
<i>Diaz.</i>

46:41.632 --> 46:42.967
[TV playing]

46:44.301 --> 46:46.178
Oh. My goodness.

46:47.972 --> 46:50.600
[sighs] How are you doing?
Are you... are you okay?

46:50.683 --> 46:52.393
Not really. No.

46:55.730 --> 46:59.024
I... I was so sorry to hear
about the baby, Dayanara.

46:59.108 --> 47:03.863
I... I was gonna call you,
but I wanted to respect your mourning.

47:03.946 --> 47:05.030
And, uh...

47:06.198 --> 47:09.577
you know, I... I guess
I was grieving a little bit, too. I did...

47:09.660 --> 47:10.911
It ain't true.

47:11.746 --> 47:13.664
- What?
<i>- My mom.</i>

47:13.748 --> 47:16.792
She lied about the baby.
She's alive.

47:16.876 --> 47:18.878
<i>I'm sorry.
I should have told you.</i>

47:20.838 --> 47:23.466
She's... She?

47:23.549 --> 47:25.092
<i>Yeah.</i>

47:25.175 --> 47:26.301
Armaria.

47:27.219 --> 47:28.471
But she's in foster care.

47:29.346 --> 47:32.767
<i>And I don't want her to be there.
It don't turn you out right.</i>

47:34.268 --> 47:35.895
She needs to have a shot.

47:35.978 --> 47:39.356
Amaria.
[stutters] That is so pretty.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.441
Is that her?

47:42.067 --> 47:43.653
No. Armaria.

47:43.736 --> 47:45.696
<i>You need to learn how to say it right.</i>

47:45.780 --> 47:46.822
Let me talk to her.

47:46.906 --> 47:49.175
And make sure that your friends
and her teachers and stuff

47:49.199 --> 47:50.993
say it right, too.

47:51.076 --> 47:52.453
'Cause it's important.

47:53.829 --> 47:54.997
I mean...

47:56.165 --> 47:57.833
unless you don't want her.

48:03.380 --> 48:04.549
Oh.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.926
Okay, look.
This is, uh... [sighs]

48:08.260 --> 48:09.679
This is a lot to process.

48:09.762 --> 48:13.057
I... I thought the baby was gone
and now... [grunts softly]

48:14.767 --> 48:16.351
<i>I don't know. I...</i>

48:16.436 --> 48:18.813
<i>I can't even wrap my head around this.</i>

48:18.896 --> 48:20.272
My baby's alive?

48:20.355 --> 48:21.356
[sighs]

48:21.441 --> 48:23.108
[voice breaking] Our baby?

48:23.192 --> 48:25.611
Mama. Mama, let me talk to Daya.

48:25.695 --> 48:26.946
Georgie, stop it!

48:27.029 --> 48:28.656
Your probation says no contact.

48:28.739 --> 48:30.407
[whimpers and sniffles]

48:31.909 --> 48:33.327
<i>I... I'm here.</i>

48:34.537 --> 48:36.622
Please. [sighs]

48:37.582 --> 48:40.751
I know this whole thing is
so messed up. But...

48:43.170 --> 48:44.797
[sighs] I just...

48:44.880 --> 48:48.926
I'm not gonna let anyone
change my mind ever again.

48:49.009 --> 48:50.553
This is my decision.

48:53.556 --> 48:55.516
I want you to have her.

48:57.477 --> 49:00.521
You're gonna be good to her.
I know you are.

49:06.235 --> 49:07.528
<i>Please.</i>

49:07.612 --> 49:08.654
[breathes raggedly]

49:10.573 --> 49:13.701
If I agree to take her...

49:13.784 --> 49:15.911
If you agree, then she's yours.

49:15.995 --> 49:19.081
Not just for the time that I'm here,
but for real.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.585
I want you to reinvent her.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.421
Don't even tell her about me.

49:29.299 --> 49:32.302
I want her to have
a shot at something normal.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.723
Please, Mommy. Please.

49:35.806 --> 49:39.560
She's my family.
I have a daughter. [whimpers]

49:40.561 --> 49:41.687
Oh...

49:43.147 --> 49:45.357
I guess I...

49:45.440 --> 49:47.067
- I think I could do that.
- Yeah. [gasps]

49:47.151 --> 49:48.360
Oh, God.

49:48.443 --> 49:49.612
- Thank you, Mommy.
- [sighs]

49:50.237 --> 49:51.739
Thank you, Mrs. Powell.

49:54.491 --> 49:55.660
[sighs]

49:56.661 --> 49:58.871
Look, I ain't gonna tell you
how to raise her

49:58.954 --> 50:02.332
or the kind of life
that she should have or whatever.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.920
It's not like I'd know, anyhow.

50:06.879 --> 50:09.423
But... if you could...

50:11.383 --> 50:13.343
give her some space, you know?

50:14.970 --> 50:17.097
Like, when she's learning how to walk,

50:17.181 --> 50:18.933
you got to let her try.

50:21.769 --> 50:26.315
[stammers] Even if she falls sometimes.
Or a lot of times.

50:26.398 --> 50:27.608
[sighs]

50:28.943 --> 50:30.402
But when she does...

50:32.738 --> 50:35.240
don't be the kind of mom who picks her up,

50:35.324 --> 50:39.119
dusts her off and...
pretends like nothing happened.

50:41.371 --> 50:44.584
You got to be okay with her crying.
And fucking up.

50:48.378 --> 50:49.755
'Cause she will.

50:52.299 --> 50:53.718
'Cause she's mine.

50:56.220 --> 50:57.722
[breathing heavily]

50:59.514 --> 51:01.058
It's in her blood, you know?

51:02.017 --> 51:03.728
<i>It's gonna... It's gonna be okay.</i>

51:04.687 --> 51:06.271
Yeah.

51:06.355 --> 51:08.107
It's gonna be okay.

51:10.275 --> 51:11.443
I got to go.

51:12.402 --> 51:14.614
- [breath trembling]
- [cell phone beeps]

51:24.123 --> 51:25.708
Just wait, please.

51:28.585 --> 51:29.670
[Fig] And?

51:30.838 --> 51:32.798
I don't know what to tell you, ladies.

51:32.882 --> 51:35.819
The governor is not comfortable with me
continuing under these circumstances.

51:35.843 --> 51:37.011
We tried, but...

51:39.847 --> 51:41.766
It took a little bit longer
than we thought.

51:43.267 --> 51:45.019
It's pretty crazy out there.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.398
[softly] Come on.

51:54.654 --> 51:55.905
You'll be okay.

52:02.619 --> 52:03.980
- [Big Boo] Come on, guys.
- Come on.

52:04.038 --> 52:06.081
Come on. You do not have to do this.

52:06.165 --> 52:09.126
Pennsatucky, man... Penns?

52:09.209 --> 52:10.460
- [Helen] Get in.
- [inmate] No.

52:10.544 --> 52:12.105
- [Helen] Get in there!
- [Leanne] Get in!

52:12.171 --> 52:13.798
[Pennsatucky talking indistinctly]

52:19.636 --> 52:21.281
You'd think they'd find a place to put 'em

52:21.305 --> 52:24.349
that wouldn't interfere
with our squirt and dirt.

52:24.433 --> 52:27.061
Well, that one was starting
to overflow anyway.

52:28.187 --> 52:30.355
But, lucky me, I can't smell a thing.

52:44.328 --> 52:46.163
[smooching]

52:58.258 --> 52:59.719
[shuddering]

53:33.127 --> 53:34.336
[line ringing]

53:39.716 --> 53:42.261

<i>How may I help you?</i>
