WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.672
[music playing]

00:04.705 --> 00:06.974
[harmonica playing]

00:09.477 --> 00:10.911
This sign isn't
coming out so good.

00:10.944 --> 00:12.513
The O is all lopsided.

00:12.546 --> 00:16.050
Well, plop your head down,
and I'll trace around it.

00:16.084 --> 00:17.585
Right, what do you guys think?

00:17.618 --> 00:20.554
The different shades of blue
represent how sad we've been

00:20.588 --> 00:21.489
since your dad's been gone.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.161
Well, I'm sure some airport
janitor will be very touch when

00:27.195 --> 00:29.630
he pulls it out of the trash.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.632
All right, come on, people.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.901
We've gotta leave here
in about five minutes.

00:33.934 --> 00:34.735
Well, I'm done.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.874
Yeah, that's great, Darlene.

00:40.908 --> 00:41.775
Come on now.

00:41.809 --> 00:42.976
I wanna meet him
at the gate, and

00:43.010 --> 00:44.578
everything's gotta be perfect.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.946
[phone ringing]

00:45.979 --> 00:49.450
And we really gotta hurry,
because the traffic is awful.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.619
Well, I'm an arm away from
being ready, so the rest of you

00:51.652 --> 00:53.721
get moving.
I'll meet you out there.

00:53.754 --> 00:54.755
Great, limo's out front.

00:54.788 --> 00:55.589
All right.

00:58.659 --> 00:59.727
All right, Andy.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.728
We're going to the airport.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.196
And since we got
the big bucks now,

01:02.230 --> 01:05.032
mommy's gonna get you one of
those fancy airport pretzels.

01:05.065 --> 01:07.368
Whoa!

01:07.401 --> 01:08.736
Look at the size of that limo.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.071
It is like twice the
size of our trailer.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.742
Mark, now, you double checked
Dan's arrival time, right?

01:14.775 --> 01:16.144
Yeah, his plane
comes in at noon,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.479
but I added on another two hours
because we're in Central Time.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.547
Mark, no.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.149
You told me that
his plane leaves

01:21.182 --> 01:22.750
at 9:00, which is
11:00 our time,

01:22.783 --> 01:24.785
which means he gets in at 4:00.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.855
4:00 Lanford time
or California time?

01:27.888 --> 01:29.957
No, the plane leaves
at 9:00 our time,

01:29.990 --> 01:31.625
which is 7:00 their turn.

01:31.659 --> 01:33.194
Which means he does
get in at noon.

01:33.227 --> 01:37.865
Noon as in Lanford time or
noon as in California time?

01:37.898 --> 01:39.066
Wait a minute.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.002
I think dad's been at the
airport for two hours.

01:42.035 --> 01:44.104
All right,
everybody shut up, and

01:44.138 --> 01:46.073
let's get going, except Mark.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.209
You stay here and figure
out why we left you home.

01:51.011 --> 01:53.147
Come on.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.449
Come on, just get the door.

01:58.486 --> 01:59.387
Where's everybody going?

02:05.926 --> 02:06.727
Hey.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.301
THEME SONG: What doesn't
kill us makes us stronger.

02:13.334 --> 02:19.407
We're gonna last longer than
the greatest wall in China,

02:19.440 --> 02:22.410
or that rabbit with a drum.

02:22.443 --> 02:26.414
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

02:26.447 --> 02:29.917
for my turn, is that
in each life rain

02:29.950 --> 02:34.888
falls, but you
also get some sun.

02:34.922 --> 02:38.892
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:38.926 --> 02:42.463
Here what I say?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.297
Any day.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.746
It was so weird doing all the
Christmas shopping without you

02:58.779 --> 03:00.047
this year.
- Well, yeah.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.815
You didn't have anybody
to carry your heavy stuff

03:01.849 --> 03:04.218
or hold your purse.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.620
But you do have a new
strapping young man,

03:06.654 --> 03:10.424
what with the new DJ.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.293
I can't believe
how much he's grown.

03:12.326 --> 03:13.694
You know, I think we
can go ahead and take

03:13.727 --> 03:16.830
that guardrail off his bed now.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.266
I'm just glad you're home, Dan.

03:18.299 --> 03:22.470
Because we can start getting
back to normal around here now.

03:22.503 --> 03:25.506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.241
You know what I was thinking?

03:27.275 --> 03:28.909
After the holidays
and everything calms

03:28.942 --> 03:30.244
down a little bit, I
think I me and you,

03:30.278 --> 03:32.446
we should go away on a trip
together, alone, you know?

03:32.480 --> 03:38.085
And I was thinking either the
Riviera or the Wisconsin Dells.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.287
I don't know, honey.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.457
I just got back from that
big trip to California.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.393
I know, but I mean, we
haven't been to the Dells

03:45.426 --> 03:46.427
for a really long time.

03:46.460 --> 03:50.398
I'm sure they'd let
us back in by now.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.165
Yeah, well, you know,
we don't have to decide

03:52.199 --> 03:53.567
on it right now, though, do we?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.668
No.

03:54.702 --> 03:59.807
No, you know, we can
think about it whenever.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.978
No, I'm just trying to say, Dan,
I'm so glad that you're home.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.380
[mumbling]

04:12.219 --> 04:15.389
You know, I mean, I was only
bringing up the idea of a trip

04:15.423 --> 04:17.024
because I thought it's
something that you'd like.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.661
Yeah, I do, but you know, do
we gotta do it right now or?

04:20.694 --> 04:23.631
Is something wrong, Dan?

04:23.664 --> 04:24.532
I'm sorry, honey.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.366
I'm just tired.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.538
I guess I got some
of that jet lag.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.406
Yeah, that's probably it.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.307
That's probably it, yeah.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.643
Yeah.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.777
I don't know, baby.

04:36.810 --> 04:39.580
Um, how about in
a couple of days,

04:39.613 --> 04:43.050
maybe me and you go
out for a big dinner.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.818
You know, just you and me.

04:44.852 --> 04:47.721
Maybe feel like I'll
take you up to Chicago.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.723
Wow, found food out of town.

04:49.757 --> 04:52.326
I can hardly wait!

04:52.360 --> 04:55.295
Hmm?

04:55.329 --> 04:57.631
Listen, I'm gonna
go ahead and shave,

04:57.665 --> 05:00.568
so I don't tear
up the pillowcase.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.402
Or me.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.941
What you got there, some
newfangled electric razor?

05:07.975 --> 05:11.679
This is like the kind they got
in that Sharper Image catalog.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.316
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.685
What's all this?

05:17.718 --> 05:23.256
Oh, That's My 12 step recovery
program for more vital skin.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.994
See, I got it at
that spa I went to.

05:27.027 --> 05:27.928
Well, I don't know, honey.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.862
You got moisturizers.

05:28.896 --> 05:32.132
I got me an electric razor.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.166
I guess there's no going back.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.839
Hey, yeah.
Maybe later we can trade.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.547
"While visions of sugar
plums danced in their Heads."

05:46.580 --> 05:49.383
Hey, sugar plum!

05:49.417 --> 05:51.084
we could really use a hand here!

05:51.118 --> 05:52.853
Hey, I wanted a living tree.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.424
No, you butchers are gonna have
to deal with your own carnage.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.558
Could you shut the door?

05:57.591 --> 05:58.392
It's freezing in here!

06:04.498 --> 06:06.467
Well, they're back, huh?

06:06.500 --> 06:07.801
Mhm.

06:07.835 --> 06:11.004
Yeah, and this year, they
actually went to a tree farm.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.173
Don't tell me you
paid for a tree.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.377
Yeah, that nursery security
guard bulked up for nothing.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.247
All right, well,
last night, huh?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.149
You and Dan, huh?

06:22.182 --> 06:23.417
How was it?

06:23.451 --> 06:25.052
Good.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.787
Aw , come on, Roseanne.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.456
It's been a long
time for your guys.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.491
Was it wild and intense?

06:30.524 --> 06:31.825
Was it like the first time?

06:31.859 --> 06:34.327
Well, his dad didn't
catch us this time,

06:34.361 --> 06:37.364
if that's what you mean.

06:37.397 --> 06:38.732
It was fine.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.667
Fine?

06:39.700 --> 06:40.901
Come on.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.704
Oh, Roseanne and Dan Connor
do not have fine sex.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.805
Well, come on, Jackie.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.607
You know, it's been
months and everything.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.509
And he was kind of
nervous, and so was I.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.745
But the most important thing is
that when he crawled into bed

06:51.779 --> 06:53.547
next to me, you know, and I--

06:53.581 --> 06:58.151
I felt that familiar sag in
his side of the mattress,

06:58.185 --> 06:59.319
I just felt like I was home.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.522
I just felt like
everything was gonna be OK.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.723
Well, let me
ask you something.

07:02.756 --> 07:06.059
When I talk about Carlos,
do I sound that sappy?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.362
You could get a part on
any Mexican soap opera.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.569
Well, I'd say Dan
does seem very happy.

07:15.603 --> 07:18.038
His mom must be doing better.
- Yeah.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.973
Yeah, they got her on
pills and everything.

07:20.007 --> 07:20.874
What are you doing?

07:20.908 --> 07:24.344
You're squishing my balls!

07:24.377 --> 07:26.614
I'm making angels thumbprints.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.082
No, these are rum balls!

07:29.116 --> 07:31.952
Now that you've made
them into rum blobs!

07:31.985 --> 07:33.453
Balls, blobs,
what's the difference?

07:33.487 --> 07:34.888
It's gonna taste the same!

07:34.922 --> 07:36.724
Not to me.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.526
I've spent all this time
rolling these things

07:38.559 --> 07:39.727
to custom fit my mouth.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.029
Now fix 'em!

07:42.062 --> 07:44.031
Geez.

07:44.064 --> 07:45.265
Uh-uh!

07:45.298 --> 07:46.500
No, no, no.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.334
Look, like this.

07:50.904 --> 07:51.705
Oh.

08:08.055 --> 08:08.856
I hate you.

08:17.264 --> 08:21.702
I said, "shut the door!"

08:21.735 --> 08:23.704
Hey, I didn't have
that problem at my house.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.238
You wanna know why?

08:25.272 --> 08:28.475
I took a tape measure with me!

08:28.508 --> 08:29.476
I hate you.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.248
Rose, I really hate
to tell you this,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.885
but it looks like we're
gonna have to amputate.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.119
There you go, Dan.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.387
I was gonna bring
your safety goggles,

08:40.420 --> 08:42.422
but I didn't wanna insult you.

08:42.455 --> 08:43.390
Yeah.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.293
Nurse!

08:46.326 --> 08:48.195
Doctor, I can't
tell you how impressed

08:48.228 --> 08:50.764
I am with the delicate
work you're about to do

08:50.798 --> 08:54.101
with those big, meaty hands.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.202
Yes, my dear.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.570
They were developed
after years of twisting

08:56.604 --> 09:00.307
off non-twist-off caps.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.342
Hey, nice tree.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.279
When do we have to send it
back to Rockefeller Center?

09:06.313 --> 09:07.247
Come on, David.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.649
Let's go to the toy
store, so we can

09:08.682 --> 09:11.251
get there before the bellowing
parents and screaming children.

09:19.126 --> 09:20.861
Hey, you don't
wanna miss that.

09:20.894 --> 09:25.198
That's the best part, with
the kids on leashes and stuff.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.266
Hey, dad.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.334
I'm glad you're home.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.136
I want you to know that.
- Thanks, honey.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.237
That's really sweet of you.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.773
I need your coat.

09:32.806 --> 09:36.176
Mine doesn't fit, and believe
it or not, I've outgrown mom's.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.611
Scary.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.511
[whistle]

09:38.545 --> 09:41.615
All right, come on, David.

09:41.649 --> 09:42.449
Timber!

09:46.419 --> 09:48.321
Hey, I'm glad I got
all this new furniture

09:48.355 --> 09:50.624
just in time to help you cut
down a tree in the living room!

10:12.913 --> 10:17.250
Ow, ow.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.151
What do you, Darlene?

10:18.185 --> 10:23.223
Should we start here or here?

10:23.256 --> 10:25.726
Hm, that is a tough one.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.466
Darling, for the first time
ever, we have a beautiful tree

10:33.500 --> 10:35.335
with all its needles!

10:35.368 --> 10:40.340
Now, do you have to make it look
like a tacky Vegas showgirl?

10:40.373 --> 10:41.374
You wish, mother.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.247
OK.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.718
Andy, let's go choose
some cookies for Santa.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.453
Make sure you put a couple
of peanut butter ones on there.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.389
I know she likes those.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.524
Where's Dan?

10:57.557 --> 10:59.526
Oh, I think he's
upstairs using the phone.

10:59.559 --> 11:01.528
He's probably
talking to his mom.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.730
Again?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.698
He's like-- he's like so
totally obsessed with her.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.399
I thought you said
she was all right.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.367
She is.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.169
And don't start
criticizing him just

11:09.202 --> 11:11.805
because we aren't lucky enough
to have our mother in a home!

11:13.907 --> 11:14.908
All right.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.711
All we have to do
now is fire him up.

11:17.745 --> 11:18.712
We've got a bad plug.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.413
There's no prongs in this.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.950
That's the female
end, you idiot!

11:22.983 --> 11:27.120
Geez, you must have buried the
plug in the middle of the tree!

11:27.154 --> 11:29.489
And we're missing
a wise man again.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.195
No, we're not.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.764
You know what they say.

11:36.797 --> 11:40.433
They say the yellow Power Ranger
is the wisest in all the land.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.976
You are not gonna believe
what I got Dan for Christmas.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.243
It's the most
amazing present ever.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.344
All right.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.746
But you're not gonna
believe-- it has to be

11:52.780 --> 11:54.647
better than what Fred got me.

11:54.681 --> 11:55.816
Bubble bath.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.150
You already opened it?

11:57.184 --> 12:00.320
It wasn't even wrapped.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.290
Man, you know, ever since
he moved in with that DA chick

12:03.323 --> 12:06.093
with them two kids, we
never see him anymore.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.761
All right, so-- so
what did you get Dan?

12:07.795 --> 12:08.728
Tell me.
Come on.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.097
No, forget about it.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.664
You haven't been able to keep
a secret since sixth grade.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.634
Well, why do you
bring it up, then?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.704
I got a big mouth too.

12:17.737 --> 12:21.174
Oh, this new
angel is beautiful.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.943
Yeah, but she ain't gonna
look that hot with a tree

12:22.976 --> 12:23.777
shoved up her butt.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.416
Here, sweetie.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.118
Allow me.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.019
All right, everybody.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.054
Gather round.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.423
Time for the traditional
hoisting of the angel.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.061
[groaning]

12:47.434 --> 12:52.205
Hey, let's hope Santa
brings a back brace this year.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.541
Cookies here!

12:54.574 --> 12:56.409
Hey, , thanks, man.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.645
Hey, hey, those are for Santa.

12:58.678 --> 12:59.913
Now, wait.

12:59.947 --> 13:02.615
I'm going to put those cookies,
darling, right over here

13:02.649 --> 13:05.685
on the mantle, where
Santa-- oh, oh, oh.

13:05.718 --> 13:06.753
That's right.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.123
My daughter got rid
of the fireplace.

13:10.157 --> 13:14.527
I guess Santa will have to come
crawling out of the cabinet.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.829
No, that's all right.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.297
We're just gonna leave these
cookies right here, where

13:17.330 --> 13:19.132
old Saint Nick can't miss 'em.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.034
So where's that
note for Santa?

13:21.068 --> 13:22.870
Oh, I got it
right here, honey.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.738
And I wrote it down exactly
like the kids told me.

13:25.772 --> 13:28.241
Oh yeah, good.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.511
"Dear Santa, are any
of your reindeer gay?

13:31.544 --> 13:32.445
Our grandma is.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.914
Love, Andy and Jerry."

13:37.717 --> 13:41.288
You know, kids say
the darnedest things.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.497
It's time for bedtime, boys.

13:50.530 --> 13:51.464
Bedtime?

13:51.498 --> 13:52.799
That's right.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.235
You guys got a busy day tomorrow
of ignoring all your toys

13:55.268 --> 13:58.138
and playing with the
boxes they came in.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.907
Here, I'll take them upstairs.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.909
Oh my, we'd better hurry.

14:01.942 --> 14:02.742
I hear reindeer hooves.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.214
Wow, she has
got great hearing.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.622
Lookie, Lookie, lookie what
I found out in the garage.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.559
All of our old
Christmas decorations.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.795
You know, nothing says
Christmas like a string

14:22.829 --> 14:26.033
of Schlitz bottle caps.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.267
All right, elves!

14:27.300 --> 14:29.402
Come on, it's time to finish
the Christmas assembly.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.338
Come on!

14:31.371 --> 14:34.407
Doberman, Peperoni,
let's go, hey, hey!

14:34.441 --> 14:35.943
All right, Mark.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.111
Walk to the garage, get me
a screwdriver and a wrench.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.546
David, go with Mark.

14:39.579 --> 14:40.613
Find out what those things are.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.520
Who wants a Tom & Jerry?

14:47.554 --> 14:49.256
What the hell is that?

14:49.289 --> 14:54.261
It's a hop, skip, and go
naked, only with grated nutmeg.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.228
Well, don't all speak at once!

14:59.066 --> 15:01.168
I think we should
get out there

15:01.201 --> 15:03.370
before she sucks all
the nitrous oxide out

15:03.403 --> 15:05.372
of the whipping cream can.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.141
Here, do something
with that, would you?

15:08.175 --> 15:10.377
Hmm.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.278
OK, she's gone.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.412
Dig in.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.246
But chew softly.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.452
You know, I think we should
leave a cookie with a big bite

15:19.486 --> 15:20.787
taken out of it.

15:20.820 --> 15:21.921
How come?

15:21.955 --> 15:24.191
'Cause it's more like
Santa was really here.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.926
OK, he's eating his cookies,
and all of a sudden,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.862
he realizes, "uh-oh, I gotta
get back to my sleigh!"

15:29.896 --> 15:32.465
And he doesn't have time
to finish the last one.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.600
That's realism.

15:33.633 --> 15:34.634
Ah, bite me.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.503
I'm eating 'em all.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.870
Oh, Christmas cookies.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.006
Yeah, you better
get yours quick.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.773
They're going fast.

15:40.807 --> 15:43.676
You know, it really is
great seeing you guys again.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.645
We're really glad
you're back, dad.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.447
Mhm.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.849
[muffled speech]

15:50.950 --> 15:52.385
Can I, you know?

15:52.419 --> 15:53.420
Oh yeah, sure.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.255
Go ahead.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.823
Wow.

15:56.856 --> 16:00.327
Hey, you should feel
it from where I am.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.594
Nobody touches that one!

16:05.165 --> 16:07.767
Oh, David, could you start
putting the tricycle together?

16:07.800 --> 16:08.668
Yep.

16:08.701 --> 16:11.571
Just found the instructions.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.841
David, men don't
read instructions.

16:14.874 --> 16:17.410
We eyeball it, think
logically, and then wing it.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.415
Yeah, well, you're a
professional mechanic,

16:22.449 --> 16:23.350
Mr. Connor.

16:23.383 --> 16:24.817
How would you put
these wheels on?

16:24.851 --> 16:26.719
Well, from my last
30 years experience

16:26.753 --> 16:30.090
as a professional mechanic,
hell, I'd glue 'em on.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.000
OK, everybody got their gifts?

16:41.034 --> 16:41.968
Yeah.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.270
All right.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.173
That's good, because we are
going to open these gifts

16:46.206 --> 16:50.577
in an orderly fashion that is
consistent with the fine Connor

16:50.610 --> 16:54.047
tradition of
Christmas etiquette.

16:54.081 --> 16:59.018
Already, set, go!

17:02.422 --> 17:04.357
And you will notice that
not one of these gifts

17:04.391 --> 17:06.759
was purchased by Santa at
the North Pole Press Club

17:06.793 --> 17:08.695
this year.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.698
I can't decide
which one to open!

17:11.731 --> 17:15.668
Well, then, you don't
get either one of them.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.569
Oh, cool.

17:16.603 --> 17:17.470
A Powerbook.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.605
Thank you.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.506
Pearls!

17:19.539 --> 17:20.773
I have always wanted pearls.

17:20.807 --> 17:21.674
Oh my God.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.975
Look at all these video games!

17:23.009 --> 17:24.577
Sable hair brushes.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.280
Snakeskin boots!

17:27.314 --> 17:30.717
You know, if you hold those
up to your ears, they rattle.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.719
My God!

17:32.752 --> 17:34.487
Are these real?

17:34.521 --> 17:37.757
Well, they ain't diamondelles
from the Home Shopping Network,

17:37.790 --> 17:39.326
sis.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.227
Look at me.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.962
I got what, a beautiful robe?

17:42.995 --> 17:46.065
Well, not just a robe, Vanna.

17:46.099 --> 17:49.001
It's a beautiful cashmere robe.

17:49.035 --> 17:53.506
And if I was you, I'd
check in the pockets there.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.508
- Oh my God.
- Yeah.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.244
Dan, look at that.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.379
Yeah, I figured you could
wear it around the house,

17:59.412 --> 18:02.682
you know, when you're
watching TV or whatnot.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.783
Thank you.

18:03.816 --> 18:04.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.353
Say nothing of it.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.155
It's beautiful.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.556
All right, everybody.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.391
Stop what you're doing, because
it's gonna take hours to open

18:11.424 --> 18:13.059
all our presents,
and I have something

18:13.092 --> 18:14.161
very important right now.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.796
In fact, I have
what I believe is

18:16.829 --> 18:21.334
called the gift de resistance.

18:21.368 --> 18:22.602
Well, a beautiful silver tray.

18:30.109 --> 18:30.977
Oh my God.

18:31.010 --> 18:31.811
It's a mortgage.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.716
And a zippo.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.585
I was gonna buy
you a Rolex watch,

18:38.618 --> 18:41.688
but this here was cheaper.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.055
Honey, I don't
know what to say.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.258
I mean, you know we--

18:45.292 --> 18:49.462
we bought the house
together, and we owe it--

18:52.932 --> 18:53.866
[inaudible]

18:53.900 --> 18:55.735
Come on, Dan.

18:55.768 --> 18:58.638
Light that sucker up.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.040
[cheering]

19:03.210 --> 19:04.010
Yahoo!

19:11.884 --> 19:16.389
Hey, Dan.
The mansion is all ours.

19:16.423 --> 19:18.458
Yeah, and honey--

19:18.491 --> 19:20.393
You don't have to
say nothing, honey.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.228
Merry Christmas.

19:24.264 --> 19:36.609
SONG: Later on, we'll conspire
as we dream by the fire

19:36.643 --> 19:41.047
to face unafraid the
plans that we made,

19:41.080 --> 19:44.917
walking in a winter wonderland.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.358
Walking in a winter wonderland.

19:54.927 --> 19:56.195
No, that's OK.
I'm all alone.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.064
They're all at the mall
exchanging everything.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.434
Well, yeah.

20:01.468 --> 20:02.802
I miss you too.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.805
It's really hard spending
Christmas without you.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.341
That is so sweet.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.842
Well, I don't know
when I'm gonna get back.

20:09.876 --> 20:13.746
I'm kind of stuck
here for a while.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.747
He misses his mommy.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.020
Listen, I just wanted to
thank you for, you know,

20:21.053 --> 20:24.624
being so great with my mom.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.926
"Mom?"

20:26.959 --> 20:31.631
Yeah, well, I gotta go.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.032
Yeah.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.402
Yeah, me too.
OK, bye.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.015
Oh my God.

20:49.048 --> 20:50.249
Oh my God.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.117
Oh my God.

20:59.626 --> 21:00.427
Oh, for crying out loud!

21:08.267 --> 21:11.170
[dialing]

21:11.203 --> 21:12.439
Oh great, just great!

21:19.211 --> 21:20.780
[phone ringing]

21:20.813 --> 21:21.648
ROSEANNE (ON VOICEMAIL): Hello.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.649
You've reached the
Connor residence.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.717
And-- [beep]

21:24.751 --> 21:25.685
SANTA (ON PHONE): Yeah, yeah.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.586
Connors?

21:26.619 --> 21:27.487
Hello.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.521
This is Santa Claus.

21:28.555 --> 21:30.289
I've got a scheduled
delivery here,

21:30.323 --> 21:33.225
and you've blocked
off the fireplace!

21:33.259 --> 21:35.294
Don't you know you're
supposed to fill out a form

21:35.328 --> 21:37.263
when you block the chimney?

21:37.296 --> 21:41.534
After 20 years, the least you
could do is drop me a line.

21:41.568 --> 21:44.303
Now, I'm just gonna leave
the gifts by the back door,

21:44.337 --> 21:47.774
unless of course,
you've changed that too!

21:47.807 --> 21:50.810
Oh yeah, ho-ho-ho!
