WEBVTT

00:02.762 --> 00:04.102
And going through
your mail at the moment.

00:04.104 --> 00:05.235
You can't trust this guy.

00:05.235 --> 00:06.849
How well do you know Alice Vaughan?

00:06.851 --> 00:08.496
I know her well enough to know

00:08.529 --> 00:09.997
that you've been bugging her house.

00:10.032 --> 00:12.500
If you ever come anywhere
near her again,

00:12.534 --> 00:13.900
I will personally see to it

00:13.936 --> 00:16.638
that you are deported back
to where you came from.

00:16.672 --> 00:18.506
Do you want to maybe get a drink?

00:18.539 --> 00:21.242
Shawn kind of asked me to dinner.

00:21.277 --> 00:23.544
Our payment is now officially past due,

00:23.579 --> 00:25.379
so it won't be long before
they send someone after us,

00:25.414 --> 00:28.181
and when that
happens, we have two options...

00:28.216 --> 00:29.484
deliver or die.

00:29.518 --> 00:31.277
You've taken the
words right out of my mouth.

00:31.286 --> 00:33.588
I really hope I don't have to kill you.

00:33.621 --> 00:35.088
Why'd you leave the family?

00:35.124 --> 00:36.557
You were next in line.

00:36.591 --> 00:38.902
No, I was never next
in line. I'm a woman.

00:38.902 --> 00:41.529
Our Benefactor has decided to forgive
your payment this month.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.896
He needs you to steal a bracelet.

00:42.930 --> 00:43.997
The Shives are here.

00:44.033 --> 00:46.600
Is every crime syndicate
in town after this bracelet?

00:46.634 --> 00:47.402
- Hello, Ben.
- Hello, Mickey.

00:47.435 --> 00:49.170
I suppose you're looking for this.

00:50.238 --> 00:52.573
Aah!

00:52.607 --> 00:53.441
Get in!

00:54.976 --> 00:56.576
3JRQ158.

00:56.612 --> 00:57.545
What's your name?

00:57.579 --> 00:58.512
Benjamin Jones.

00:58.546 --> 01:00.747
Benjamin Jones.

01:00.783 --> 01:02.783
Where is it? Alice, I
don't have time for games.

01:02.817 --> 01:04.617
If you want your bracelet
back, you're going

01:04.653 --> 01:07.388
to have to play by my rules from now on.

01:13.896 --> 01:15.430
There you
are! Where have you been?

01:15.463 --> 01:17.397
I've been calling you all night.

01:17.432 --> 01:18.533
My phone died.

01:18.567 --> 01:19.801
I thought you died.

01:19.835 --> 01:21.468
- What happened?
- Oh, uh...

01:21.503 --> 01:23.271
Mickey Shive's aim isn't
what it used to be.

01:23.305 --> 01:24.572
- Well, are you okay? Let me see.
- I'm fine.

01:24.605 --> 01:26.239
- It's just a scratch.
- Good.

01:26.275 --> 01:27.641
- Well, did you get the bracelet?
- I did.

01:27.676 --> 01:29.109
I just... I have to shower and change.

01:29.144 --> 01:30.912
No, there's no time. We've
got a new problem.

01:30.945 --> 01:32.212
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait.

01:40.456 --> 01:42.390
- Benji!
- Rhys.

01:43.325 --> 01:44.491
Felicity.

01:44.526 --> 01:45.926
Morning.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.829
Benji!

01:47.862 --> 01:50.731
How are ya?!

01:50.765 --> 01:52.500
You look well. Bit tired.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.301
- Ah! Ah!
- Ooh, what happened here?

01:54.335 --> 01:55.736
- Uh...
- Mwah!

01:55.771 --> 01:57.337
Did you miss me?

01:57.372 --> 01:58.840
Hello, sis. Mwah.

01:58.873 --> 02:01.409
As you can see, my
brother's here for a visit.

02:01.442 --> 02:03.578
Our Benefactor has come to collect.

02:03.611 --> 02:04.745
Right, then.

02:04.780 --> 02:07.114
Where's my bracelet?

02:11.620 --> 02:13.621
Why do I have a
feeling this is not a social call?

02:13.655 --> 02:15.423
I need that bracelet back.

02:15.456 --> 02:16.456
See, you're fine stealing

02:16.457 --> 02:18.158
from other people, but
when it happens to you,

02:18.193 --> 02:19.127
you don't like it.

02:19.161 --> 02:20.594
I was forced to steal
it to pay off my debt,

02:20.628 --> 02:21.695
and if I don't hand it over,

02:21.729 --> 02:24.086
- if I don't pay off my debt...
- You're a dead man?

02:24.086 --> 02:25.828
I can tell by the way you
said that, you don't believe me.

02:25.829 --> 02:27.602
I spent a year believing you.

02:27.635 --> 02:28.468
Look where that got me.

02:28.503 --> 02:30.063
That was the old me. This is the new me.

02:30.072 --> 02:31.639
And the new me is gonna
get shot in the head

02:31.673 --> 02:33.233
if you don't give me the bracelet back.

02:33.241 --> 02:35.276
If I give it back, I'm
an accessory to a crime.

02:35.310 --> 02:36.978
If you keep it, you'll be
found guilty of the crime.

02:37.012 --> 02:37.978
And let me tell you something...

02:38.013 --> 02:39.713
my Benefactor isn't the
only one looking for it.

02:39.747 --> 02:41.149
Those people shooting at me last night?

02:41.182 --> 02:42.216
If they find out you have it,

02:42.251 --> 02:43.016
they'll be shooting at you, too.

02:43.050 --> 02:44.786
Now you're just trying to scare me.

02:44.819 --> 02:46.052
No, I'm trying to terrify you,

02:46.087 --> 02:47.555
because you should be terrified,

02:47.588 --> 02:48.622
because I'm terrified for you.

02:48.656 --> 02:49.790
All right, fine.

02:49.824 --> 02:51.959
You want the bracelet so badly?

02:51.993 --> 02:53.326
Come and get it.

02:56.831 --> 02:59.500
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.Addic7ed.com -

03:01.770 --> 03:03.670
I don't
want to bother him, you know.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.840
It's... maybe something for later.

03:05.873 --> 03:07.108
He's great.

03:07.141 --> 03:09.176
But Alice... She's busy,
too, and I just don't think that...

03:09.211 --> 03:11.344
Yes, we're talking about you.

03:11.379 --> 03:14.215
Shawn needs your help.

03:14.248 --> 03:15.383
It's actually not for me.

03:15.417 --> 03:16.884
It's for an army buddy of mine.

03:16.919 --> 03:18.352
You were in the Army?

03:18.387 --> 03:20.153
- The four years after college.
- Totally.

03:20.188 --> 03:21.855
She's one of the
first female Army Rangers,

03:21.889 --> 03:23.390
and she could really use your help.

03:23.425 --> 03:25.259
"She"?

03:25.294 --> 03:27.120
Captain Nia Brooks,
this is Alice Vaughan...

03:27.145 --> 03:27.728
Hi.

03:27.763 --> 03:28.728
- Valerie Anderson...
- Hello.

03:28.764 --> 03:30.564
And this is
Danny Yoon, the detective

03:30.598 --> 03:33.366
I was telling you about, and Sophie.

03:33.401 --> 03:34.701
I have heard good things.

03:34.735 --> 03:36.603
Oh, he's way too nice to me.

03:36.638 --> 03:39.173
He is
annoyingly perfect, isn't he?

03:41.909 --> 03:43.578
We hear congratulations are in order.

03:43.611 --> 03:44.878
You're making history.

03:44.913 --> 03:47.348
Thank you, but I'm not sure what I'm...

03:47.382 --> 03:48.449
Don't let her downplay it.

03:48.484 --> 03:51.252
Nia's the first woman ever
to join the Rangers...

03:51.286 --> 03:53.020
the Army's elite special ops force.

03:53.055 --> 03:55.622
Now that the Pentagon's
opened up combat roles to women,

03:55.656 --> 03:57.258
she'll be among the first to deploy.

03:57.292 --> 03:59.192
Which is why there's been backlash.

03:59.228 --> 04:01.461
Stupid stuff at first.

04:01.497 --> 04:03.865
My gear was stolen, equipment
was messed with.

04:03.899 --> 04:05.633
But then I started getting threats.

04:05.667 --> 04:06.700
What kind of threats?

04:06.735 --> 04:09.804
E-mails, notes, photos.

04:09.837 --> 04:11.938
Did you report all this?

04:11.973 --> 04:14.241
To my commanding officer weeks ago.

04:14.276 --> 04:16.142
But then I got this.

04:16.177 --> 04:18.312
My dog tags, which had been stolen,

04:18.346 --> 04:20.714
along with a killed-in-action letter

04:20.749 --> 04:23.216
on official stationary
addressed to my parents.

04:23.252 --> 04:24.317
That's when I said maybe

04:24.353 --> 04:25.720
she should come in and meet you guys.

04:25.754 --> 04:28.221
Yeah, but the thing is, if anyone knew

04:28.257 --> 04:29.824
I went outside the Army for help...

04:29.858 --> 04:30.925
No one will know.

04:30.959 --> 04:32.627
We will figure out who's behind this,

04:32.661 --> 04:33.728
and we'll make it stop.

04:33.762 --> 04:35.663
What you're doing is too important.

04:35.697 --> 04:37.665
Thank you.

04:37.699 --> 04:39.733
But if you could
just find out who this is,

04:39.768 --> 04:41.302
I'll take care of it myself.

04:45.874 --> 04:48.276
Maybe you can take
care of a federal agent

04:48.310 --> 04:49.677
for me while you're at it.

04:49.711 --> 04:50.944
No, please. Allow me.

04:55.884 --> 04:57.752
So, where is it?

04:57.786 --> 04:59.019
Someplace safe.

04:59.053 --> 05:01.187
That sounds unnecessarily mysterious.

05:01.223 --> 05:03.357
There were Shives all
over the consulate last night.

05:03.391 --> 05:05.026
Reps from all the major U.S. syndicates.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.026
Armed to the teeth.

05:06.060 --> 05:07.862
So I hid the
bracelet so if they got to me,

05:07.896 --> 05:08.930
they wouldn't be able to get to it.

05:08.963 --> 05:10.598
Clever boy. Well done.

05:10.632 --> 05:12.365
- How's your omelet?
- Mm, it's fine.

05:12.401 --> 05:15.136
You must have worked
up quite an appetite.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.170
Mmm!

05:17.204 --> 05:18.872
That is good. You want
to try Felicity's omelet?

05:18.906 --> 05:20.807
No, thanks. I've had it.

05:20.841 --> 05:22.343
So, what is this bracelet, Rhys?

05:22.377 --> 05:24.045
Why is every crook in town after it?

05:24.079 --> 05:25.478
'Cause it's worth a bloody fortune.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.800
Well, you already have a fortune.

05:26.814 --> 05:28.382
Several, including mine.

05:28.417 --> 05:29.850
- Now, now.
- Ben's right.

05:29.884 --> 05:31.485
You didn't fly
all the way from London

05:31.519 --> 05:32.887
for a piece of jewelry.

05:32.920 --> 05:33.687
What's it really?

05:35.490 --> 05:37.324
All right.

05:37.358 --> 05:39.293
- The truth?
- Mm-hmm.

05:39.327 --> 05:41.795
I'm not here for the bracelet.

05:41.829 --> 05:43.798
I'm not just here for the bracelet.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.468
I'm here because Mum sent me.

05:47.502 --> 05:48.836
- You are not!
- What?

05:48.870 --> 05:50.670
- It's true.
- Since when do you listen to Mum?

05:50.706 --> 05:52.505
How can you not? She bangs on and on.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.408
- The woman never shuts up.
- About what?

05:54.442 --> 05:56.677
About you. About us.

05:56.711 --> 05:58.312
She wants us to make peace.

05:58.346 --> 06:00.180
I wasn't aware we were at war.

06:00.214 --> 06:02.716
No, not officially.

06:02.750 --> 06:03.718
So you'll forgive our debt?

06:03.752 --> 06:05.552
Yes. I will.

06:05.586 --> 06:08.755
The minute you pay me back.

06:08.790 --> 06:09.656
And so much for making peace.

06:09.690 --> 06:11.891
I did forgive you this month's payment

06:11.927 --> 06:13.593
in exchange for the bracelet.

06:13.629 --> 06:15.896
Speaking of which...

06:15.930 --> 06:17.497
Shall you and me go and retrieve it

06:17.531 --> 06:18.832
from its secret hiding place?

06:18.867 --> 06:21.334
I think it's safer
for you if I go alone,

06:21.370 --> 06:23.269
in case anyone's watching me.

06:23.305 --> 06:25.906
That's pretty thoughtful of you, Benji.

06:27.975 --> 06:29.310
Don't be long.

06:31.000 --> 06:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:43.057 --> 06:44.759
I've come to apologize.

06:44.793 --> 06:46.894
We're not interested in your apology.

06:46.927 --> 06:49.230
Then perhaps this.

06:49.264 --> 06:50.730
A peace offering.

06:51.932 --> 06:53.600
What are we looking at?

06:53.634 --> 06:56.470
A gala at the Larรกgan Consulate.

06:56.504 --> 06:58.939
They had an uninvited guest.

06:58.973 --> 07:00.940
Your friend, Christopher Hall.

07:00.975 --> 07:04.879
We believe he stole something from
the Larรกgan Prime Minister.

07:04.913 --> 07:06.079
What did he steal?

07:06.113 --> 07:08.682
This.

07:10.819 --> 07:15.456
If we find that bracelet, we'll
find Christopher Hall.

07:24.709 --> 07:26.143
Maybe he is here to make peace.

07:26.177 --> 07:27.778
Oh, right, 'cause that's what Rhys does.

07:27.812 --> 07:29.331
Wherever he goes, he just makes peace.

07:29.346 --> 07:30.680
Why would you believe anything

07:30.714 --> 07:31.747
that comes out of his lying mouth?

07:31.783 --> 07:33.558
Because I know him.
I know when he's lying.

07:33.584 --> 07:34.151
See?

07:34.185 --> 07:35.985
This is exactly why I
had to get you away from him...

07:36.019 --> 07:37.620
because the minute the
two of you are together,

07:37.654 --> 07:39.189
- I cease to exist.
- That's not true.

07:39.223 --> 07:41.324
I am partners with you now, not him.

07:41.358 --> 07:43.360
Well, make sure he knows that.

07:43.394 --> 07:44.761
I know my brother.

07:44.795 --> 07:46.463
He's here for more than just a bracelet.

07:46.497 --> 07:50.033
So whatever it is, we
have to present a united front.

07:50.067 --> 07:51.867
He'll try and divide and conquer.

07:51.903 --> 07:53.036
He always does.

07:53.071 --> 07:57.040
So we can't let him or
anything else come between us.

07:57.074 --> 07:58.908
Do you promise me?

08:00.677 --> 08:03.012
I promise.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.387
We don't know much about the bracelet...

08:11.422 --> 08:14.624
only that every crime
syndicate in town seems to be after it.

08:14.658 --> 08:16.192
But you think Christopher has it.

08:16.226 --> 08:17.860
So what do you want from us?

08:17.894 --> 08:19.362
You're the one with all the information.

08:19.396 --> 08:21.964
I wanted to share it with
you to make it up to you.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.067
You think this makes
up for bugging my house,

08:24.101 --> 08:24.935
invading my privacy?

08:24.968 --> 08:27.536
We all have the same goal, Ms. Vaughan.

08:27.572 --> 08:30.339
We have very different
methods, Agent Dao.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.143
So if you'll excuse me...

08:36.346 --> 08:39.048
You want to make it up to her?

08:39.082 --> 08:43.220
Then don't come
back until you catch him.

08:52.429 --> 08:54.197
You slept with my brother!

08:54.231 --> 08:56.533
I wasn't aware you and I were exclusive.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.067
No, we're not. Let's be clear.

08:58.101 --> 09:00.669
This is not romantic
jealousy you are witnessing.

09:00.705 --> 09:02.172
This is disgust.

09:02.206 --> 09:05.075
You slept with me, and then
you slept with my brother.

09:05.109 --> 09:06.409
Technically, I slept with him first.

09:06.443 --> 09:07.980
I've been doing
that for quite some time.

09:07.980 --> 09:09.765
- I assumed you knew.
- How would I know?

09:09.780 --> 09:11.947
Given your rather
pronounced lesbian tendencies,

09:11.982 --> 09:13.450
why would I make that assumption?

09:13.484 --> 09:14.384
You sleep with Ben.

09:14.418 --> 09:16.099
How do you explain your
lesbian tendencies?

09:16.120 --> 09:17.421
I prefer not to.

09:17.455 --> 09:19.188
Takes all the fun out of them.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.365
Did you know he was coming?

09:22.393 --> 09:23.899
No, I would have told you.

09:23.899 --> 09:25.528
Do you know why he wants this bracelet?

09:25.562 --> 09:27.297
He's not said.

09:27.331 --> 09:29.865
Can you find out?

09:34.105 --> 09:35.806
He thinks I'm his.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.375
Right, which is exactly
why he might actually tell you.

09:38.408 --> 09:40.210
And then you can tell me.

09:42.179 --> 09:43.413
What's in it for me?

09:43.447 --> 09:44.581
I don't know.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.216
What would you like?

09:53.290 --> 09:55.158
You are disgusting.

09:55.192 --> 09:57.126
- I think I'm nice.
- Hmm.

10:00.865 --> 10:02.832
So, both the Army and
the media are making Nia

10:02.866 --> 10:04.734
the center of
attention with these stories.

10:04.769 --> 10:05.701
There have been articles for

10:05.735 --> 10:06.836
and against her in
every major publication.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.306
And the stuff on the
message boards is out of control.

10:09.340 --> 10:10.907
But this was somebody close to her,

10:10.942 --> 10:12.302
close enough to steal her dog tags.

10:12.309 --> 10:13.809
Someone she went to Ranger school

10:13.835 --> 10:15.177
with, someone who washed out?

10:15.212 --> 10:16.947
Sophie and I went through
a list of the wash-outs.

10:16.980 --> 10:18.581
And so far, there's
only one of them who's had

10:18.615 --> 10:20.951
access to this kind of
official stationary.

10:20.985 --> 10:22.652
1st Lieutenant Evan Connors.

10:22.687 --> 10:24.653
That little bitch is
making death threats?

10:24.688 --> 10:26.623
I didn't say that, or use those words,

10:26.657 --> 10:28.158
but has he ever said anything?

10:28.192 --> 10:29.817
No. No, he knows better.

10:29.818 --> 10:31.128
What about any other Rangers?

10:31.162 --> 10:32.863
The other Rangers are my family now.

10:32.897 --> 10:34.163
They've got my back. It isn't them.

10:34.197 --> 10:36.099
What about outside the Rangers?

10:36.134 --> 10:37.801
The only person I see is Shawn.

10:37.835 --> 10:38.869
Shawn?

10:38.903 --> 10:41.037
Sullivan, as in Agent Shawn.

10:41.072 --> 10:42.972
Wait, so you and Shawn are...

10:43.006 --> 10:45.274
No, I thought he was dating you.

10:45.308 --> 10:47.777
No, I mean, we've gone
out a couple times...

10:47.812 --> 10:49.278
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry.

10:49.312 --> 10:50.312
- Was that a secret?
- No, no.

10:50.347 --> 10:51.759
No, it's fine.

10:52.615 --> 10:54.817
So, when do I get to have

10:54.851 --> 10:56.385
this little chat with Evan Connors?

10:56.419 --> 10:58.154
Not yet. Not until we have proof.

10:58.188 --> 10:59.548
We'll find this guy, whoever he is.

10:59.557 --> 11:03.293
Just... give us a little more time.

11:07.919 --> 11:10.020
We're
talking more now than we did

11:10.054 --> 11:11.022
when you were Christopher Hall.

11:11.056 --> 11:11.822
Where are you now?

11:11.856 --> 11:13.791
On my way to the Larรกgan Consulate

11:13.826 --> 11:14.859
to return the bracelet.

11:14.893 --> 11:16.027
Alice, don't do that.

11:16.061 --> 11:17.961
Agent Dao is looking for it, too.

11:17.995 --> 11:19.963
Dao's the least of
my problems right now.

11:19.998 --> 11:21.599
Mine, too, at the moment.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.802
I'll have to call you back.

11:29.269 --> 11:33.138
I assume you're here for this?

11:48.087 --> 11:49.554
Allie, behind you!

11:53.493 --> 11:55.561
I'll take that gun and the bracelet.

12:11.110 --> 12:12.211
Are you all right? Are you
hurt? Is your neck okay?

12:12.245 --> 12:13.544
- I'm fine! I'm fine!
- How's your neck?

12:13.580 --> 12:14.679
- They're getting away!
- Is your neck okay?

12:14.714 --> 12:16.914
- You're not going after them.
- Don't tell me what to do.

12:16.950 --> 12:17.716
Get in the car or get out of my way!

12:17.750 --> 12:19.585
This is my debt! It's my problem!

12:19.619 --> 12:21.419
It's my fault I stole
the bracelet from you.

12:21.453 --> 12:22.687
I am doing this alone.

12:24.289 --> 12:25.791
Let me help.

12:25.825 --> 12:26.692
I want to help.

12:26.725 --> 12:28.460
You want to help me steal a bracelet?

12:28.495 --> 12:31.263
I want to help you not die.

12:31.297 --> 12:33.264
You don't know
anything about these people...

12:33.298 --> 12:34.899
who they are or how they work.

12:36.870 --> 12:39.770
No, I don't.

12:39.806 --> 12:41.907
But I know someone who does.

12:42.456 --> 12:44.657
You want to work with Agent Dao?

12:44.692 --> 12:45.959
Mm-hmm.

12:45.993 --> 12:47.527
Are you absolutely sure?

12:47.561 --> 12:50.062
Mm-hmm.

12:53.801 --> 12:54.933
Is he back?

12:54.969 --> 12:56.469
- Have you heard from him?
- Not yet.

12:56.504 --> 12:59.471
I thought you two were
supposed to be partners.

12:59.506 --> 13:00.472
We are.

13:00.508 --> 13:01.707
When Benji and I were partners,

13:01.741 --> 13:03.022
I knew where he was at all times.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.543
Well, maybe that's why he's working

13:04.577 --> 13:05.845
with me and not with you.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.215
You're in a mood.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.518
I have missed you, you know.

13:11.552 --> 13:12.471
You have not.

13:12.485 --> 13:14.019
I have.

13:14.053 --> 13:15.522
You used to do all the work.

13:15.556 --> 13:16.822
I didn't have to do anything.

13:16.856 --> 13:18.191
Yeah, it's good to be king.

13:18.225 --> 13:20.527
Did you actually
think that when Dad died

13:20.561 --> 13:22.394
they would put you in charge?

13:22.428 --> 13:24.963
I mean, I don't know if
you've noticed, darling,

13:24.999 --> 13:26.566
but you're kind of a lady.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.134
Men don't like
taking orders from ladies.

13:29.168 --> 13:30.537
Tell that to the Queen.

13:30.571 --> 13:32.905
I think Elizabeth knows.

13:32.940 --> 13:36.475
The thing is...

13:36.509 --> 13:38.510
you act as if you've been exiled.

13:38.546 --> 13:42.649
When, in actual fact, you abandoned me,

13:42.682 --> 13:44.017
and you took Benji with you.

13:44.051 --> 13:45.485
He did have a choice in the matter.

13:45.519 --> 13:47.153
Yeah, but I couldn't exactly offer him

13:47.187 --> 13:48.520
the same enticements, could I?

13:48.556 --> 13:50.557
Not for lack of trying.

13:50.591 --> 13:52.424
He is rather straight, isn't he?

13:52.459 --> 13:53.927
Bless him.

13:53.961 --> 13:56.195
How are things in that department?

13:56.230 --> 13:57.764
Fine, thanks.

13:57.798 --> 14:01.400
How's about things with
you and whatever her name is?

14:01.434 --> 14:02.936
Felicity.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.404
She's fascinated by the two of you.

14:05.438 --> 14:09.609
She tells me you do all your
own legwork for every con.

14:09.643 --> 14:11.076
Yeah, well, we can't
exactly afford staff

14:11.110 --> 14:12.412
with the debt you've got us carrying.

14:12.446 --> 14:14.212
I keep meaning to ask you.

14:14.248 --> 14:15.548
What happened?

14:15.582 --> 14:17.616
How come you got no
money all of a sudden?

14:17.650 --> 14:19.085
You used to be very good at this.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.519
I still am!

14:20.553 --> 14:22.120
It's not me. It's your precious Benji.

14:22.155 --> 14:23.556
Really?

14:23.591 --> 14:24.923
Do tell.

14:28.294 --> 14:29.729
You're back.

14:29.763 --> 14:31.864
I was worried.

14:31.899 --> 14:34.200
About you, not the bracelet.

14:34.234 --> 14:35.601
Can I have it?

14:35.635 --> 14:37.636
I'm sorry.

14:37.671 --> 14:39.572
Mickey Shive was waiting for me.

14:45.578 --> 14:47.779
What do you think they're
gonna do with it?

14:47.815 --> 14:50.216
Sell it, of course.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.750
Same as me.

14:51.784 --> 14:53.552
To whom?

14:57.091 --> 14:59.459
Rhys, if you tell us a
bit about the bracelet,

14:59.493 --> 15:00.927
we can help you recover it.

15:00.961 --> 15:03.395
Oh, you're going to.

15:05.499 --> 15:08.467
Tell me about Mickey Shive.

15:13.206 --> 15:15.908
So, what do we know about 1st
Lieutenant Evan Connors?

15:15.942 --> 15:17.677
He drinks light beer.

15:17.711 --> 15:20.078
That's reason enough to sic Nia on him.

15:23.517 --> 15:25.397
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
get back to you on that.

15:27.687 --> 15:29.588
You need to turn around and go home.

15:29.623 --> 15:31.524
What are you doing here? If
anyone sees me with you...

15:31.557 --> 15:33.525
You know how we avoid
that? By leaving right now.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.760
- Let's go.
- He's here, isn't he?

15:34.794 --> 15:37.296
- I just want to talk to him.
- Do you want our help or not?

15:37.331 --> 15:39.698
- There a problem here?
- No.

15:39.732 --> 15:41.433
There's not a problem here.

15:41.467 --> 15:43.336
- Danny, this is my brother, Brian.
- Who's this guy?

15:43.370 --> 15:44.202
- A friend of mine.
- I'm...

15:44.238 --> 15:46.272
All right? Now go back to your friends.

15:46.306 --> 15:48.508
I'm fine.

15:48.542 --> 15:49.875
Nia, Nia, Stop!

15:49.909 --> 15:51.543
Was this you?

15:53.647 --> 15:55.615
Nope.

15:55.649 --> 15:58.551
But whoever it was, I'm a fan.

15:58.585 --> 16:00.620
- What the hell's going on here?
- Nia, can we go?

16:00.653 --> 16:03.655
I carried the same weight as you,
ran the same miles as you.

16:03.691 --> 16:05.957
I just didn't wash out like you.

16:05.993 --> 16:08.695
You failed twice, same as me.

16:08.729 --> 16:10.229
But Sergeant Moore was told he had

16:10.264 --> 16:11.630
to graduate at least one woman.

16:11.664 --> 16:13.732
So if you're
wondering why we all hate you,

16:13.767 --> 16:14.900
including Sergeant Moore...

16:14.934 --> 16:16.335
You want to talk that way to my sister

16:16.370 --> 16:17.235
in front of me, Lieutenant?

16:17.270 --> 16:18.671
You sure you want to do that?

16:18.706 --> 16:19.672
I can fight my own battles, Brian.

16:19.706 --> 16:21.673
You want to find out what
kind of soldier I am?

16:21.708 --> 16:23.142
Come on.

16:23.177 --> 16:24.644
You and me, right now.

16:24.677 --> 16:26.211
See?

16:26.245 --> 16:28.648
That's the thing about girls...

16:28.682 --> 16:30.082
so emotional.

16:30.116 --> 16:33.418
You're not worth it.

16:35.054 --> 16:36.688
Nia.

16:36.724 --> 16:38.356
Nia!

16:38.392 --> 16:40.493
Why would I bother with death threats?

16:40.527 --> 16:42.495
You're not even a real soldier.

16:42.528 --> 16:44.864
The minute you land
overseas, you're gonna die.

16:46.567 --> 16:47.567
Hey.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.568
- What did you do that for?
- That wasn't for you.

16:49.602 --> 16:51.504
That was for me. I hate that guy.

16:51.538 --> 16:53.873
You're focusing on
Christopher because you want it

16:53.907 --> 16:55.540
to be Christopher, but we can't ignore

16:55.576 --> 16:57.710
the other two crime
families that were there last night.

16:57.745 --> 16:58.977
We're watching all of them.

16:59.011 --> 17:02.948
If Mickey Shive has the
bracelet and tries to move it or sell it,

17:02.982 --> 17:05.785
we'll be there when
Christopher tries to steal it from them.

17:05.818 --> 17:07.452
And if Christopher has the bracelet?

17:07.488 --> 17:09.406
We'll be there when they
try to take it from him.

17:09.423 --> 17:12.723
Will you let me know when and
where so I can be there?

17:12.759 --> 17:14.160
Of course.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.265
Does your hand hurt?

17:19.298 --> 17:20.165
- No, it's fine.
- Really?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.901
'Cause that's not how you throw a punch.

17:21.934 --> 17:22.769
That was a solid punch!

17:22.803 --> 17:24.242
No, that is how you break your hand.

17:24.270 --> 17:25.371
Come here. Let me show you.

17:25.404 --> 17:27.539
- Oh, easy! Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

17:27.574 --> 17:30.108
That is gonna
be bad in the morning.

17:30.144 --> 17:32.411
Let's put some ice on it.

17:46.492 --> 17:51.096
Don't touch anything.

17:51.131 --> 17:53.231
What's that supposed to be?

17:53.267 --> 17:55.468
A battlefield cross

17:55.501 --> 17:57.603
for soldiers who die in combat.

18:01.107 --> 18:02.741
It's my grave.

18:10.801 --> 18:12.669
Mickey Shive has a girlfriend.

18:12.703 --> 18:13.604
That poor girl.

18:13.637 --> 18:16.740
She's a porn star, and personal trainer,

18:16.775 --> 18:18.608
of course, named Erin Savvy.

18:18.643 --> 18:19.803
I love Los Angeles, don't you?

18:19.810 --> 18:21.612
Ms. Savvy has an apartment

18:21.645 --> 18:23.846
at the Park Plaza, and Shive is there.

18:23.882 --> 18:25.749
- I'm on my way now.
- I'll come with you.

18:25.784 --> 18:27.651
No, you will not.

18:27.684 --> 18:31.320
Mickey Shive is probably
armed, definitely dangerous,

18:31.355 --> 18:33.523
and you're not going anywhere near him.

18:33.557 --> 18:36.125
And as for you, you're
not doing yourself any favors

18:36.161 --> 18:38.429
with me coming up here
trying to get my partner killed.

18:38.462 --> 18:41.198
- I only came here bec...
- Now you're interrupting?

18:41.231 --> 18:43.800
We want to catch
Christopher as much as you do.

18:43.835 --> 18:45.669
And we're happy to share information.

18:45.702 --> 18:48.204
But that is it. You copy?

18:48.239 --> 18:49.972
Copy that.

18:51.643 --> 18:52.776
Allie?

18:52.810 --> 18:54.111
Copy that.

19:00.050 --> 19:02.594
_

19:03.414 --> 19:06.310
_

19:07.525 --> 19:08.991
There he is.

19:09.027 --> 19:11.862
That's him. That's Mickey Shive.

19:11.895 --> 19:15.731
Oh, he does look like a
proper gangster, doesn't he?

19:17.935 --> 19:19.236
I'm making the call.

19:19.269 --> 19:20.537
Oh, I wanted to make the call.

19:20.571 --> 19:21.979
- It's already dialing.
- I've practiced

19:22.003 --> 19:23.006
my accent and everything.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.174
- Rhys, this is serious.
- I know. Give me the phone.

19:28.512 --> 19:30.480
911? There's a man.

19:30.515 --> 19:32.148
He's been shot. I think he's dying.

19:32.182 --> 19:35.685
Please. Uh, yeah, the
Park Plaza, room 701.

19:35.720 --> 19:38.721
Oh, my God,
there's... there's so much blood.

19:40.758 --> 19:42.726
It's a little theatrical.

19:42.759 --> 19:43.794
You
used to love my theatrics.

19:43.827 --> 19:45.929
Yeah, your theatrics got
us into a lot of trouble.

19:45.963 --> 19:47.730
You used to love trouble.

19:47.765 --> 19:49.833
My sister's domesticated you.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.701
She sucked all the fun out of you,

19:51.736 --> 19:52.970
like some Earl Grey succubus.

19:53.003 --> 19:55.372
Just because it's not you and
me getting wasted every night,

19:55.405 --> 19:56.906
with different women every night...

19:56.941 --> 19:58.275
- Sometimes the same woman.
- doesn't mean...

19:58.308 --> 20:00.109
- At the same time.
- that I'm not fun.

20:00.144 --> 20:01.744
Yeah, but are you happy, Benji?

20:03.714 --> 20:06.215
You don't seem very happy to me.

20:08.952 --> 20:10.019
Shive's on the move.

20:12.457 --> 20:14.924
You didn't answer my question.

20:14.959 --> 20:16.559
Well, I think it's called growing up.

20:16.594 --> 20:17.560
Oh.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.096
You've grown up, have you?

20:19.130 --> 20:20.763
I'm trying.

20:26.304 --> 20:27.770
So is that why you left?

20:27.805 --> 20:28.971
You know why I left.

20:29.007 --> 20:31.141
You made it impossible for her to stay.

20:31.175 --> 20:32.942
What? And you and Margot
are the same person, are you?

20:32.977 --> 20:34.944
You have to do everything she does?

20:34.979 --> 20:36.145
Oh, I hate couples like that.

20:36.181 --> 20:38.981
You wouldn't even know
each other if it weren't for me.

20:39.017 --> 20:40.817
I invited you into this family.

20:40.852 --> 20:43.452
You were my partner, and she stole you.

20:43.488 --> 20:45.788
She didn't steal me.

20:45.823 --> 20:48.959
I left because I wanted to be with her.

20:48.992 --> 20:50.493
Interesting. Interesting.

20:50.528 --> 20:52.828
Use of the word "wanted..." past tense.

20:52.864 --> 20:53.829
Now you're reaching.

20:53.865 --> 20:55.898
Now, I'm just
listening, just mirroring.

20:55.933 --> 20:57.934
You can come back to the
firm any time you want, you know.

20:57.969 --> 20:59.836
- I've forgiven you.
- Oh, you've forgiven me?

20:59.871 --> 21:02.138
Hey, maybe I've done
some growing up, too.

21:04.976 --> 21:06.309
Right.

21:06.344 --> 21:08.010
When can we put the siren on?

21:14.685 --> 21:16.086
It's called the battlefield cross.

21:16.119 --> 21:16.886
Oh, my God.

21:16.921 --> 21:18.622
The door was open when we got there,

21:18.655 --> 21:19.623
but it didn't look forced.

21:19.656 --> 21:20.923
So they might have had a key.

21:20.959 --> 21:22.159
Or stolen a key and copied it.

21:22.192 --> 21:24.694
If they got to her dog tags,
could have gotten to her key.

21:24.729 --> 21:26.663
Can we check CCTV
footage from last night?

21:26.698 --> 21:28.865
I did, but you can't see Nia's
house from the street.

21:28.900 --> 21:30.666
Couldn't have been Evan.
I was tailing him all day.

21:30.701 --> 21:32.142
Did Nia give you any other suspects?

21:32.170 --> 21:34.805
No, but Evan did... he
said Nia's C.O. was forced

21:34.838 --> 21:36.839
to graduate at least one female Ranger.

21:36.874 --> 21:39.308
- If only for publicity's sake.
- What's his name?

21:39.344 --> 21:41.211
His name is Sergeant Joshua Moore.

21:41.246 --> 21:43.880
I'll see what I can dig up on him.

21:43.914 --> 21:45.182
Did you search Nia's house last night?

21:45.215 --> 21:46.450
No, I'm headed back there now.

21:46.483 --> 21:48.018
- I'll come with you?
- Yeah, sure.

21:56.927 --> 21:59.363
You could have your old job
back, be your own man.

21:59.396 --> 22:01.064
What makes you think I'm not my own man?

22:01.098 --> 22:02.419
My sister would never allow that.

22:02.432 --> 22:03.634
You underestimate her.

22:03.667 --> 22:05.535
That is one thing I would never do.

22:09.374 --> 22:11.008
Is there a problem, officer?

22:11.041 --> 22:13.309
As a matter of fact, Mickey, there is.

22:13.344 --> 22:16.913
You see, you took something
very valuable from my friend here.

22:16.948 --> 22:19.650
Hello, Mickey.

22:25.455 --> 22:26.556
See how much fun this is?!

22:26.590 --> 22:28.692
See, if you came back, we
could do this all the time.

22:28.726 --> 22:30.027
Do you want to have a go?

22:32.430 --> 22:34.096
Suit yourself.

22:48.546 --> 22:50.413
Nia?

22:53.116 --> 22:55.117
What are you guys doing here?

22:55.153 --> 22:57.253
You can't be here. I'm not alone.

22:59.123 --> 23:00.790
Oh.

23:00.825 --> 23:02.893
Hey, I'm Todd.

23:02.926 --> 23:05.061
Uh, Captain Todd Walker, this is...

23:05.096 --> 23:06.962
Captain, I'm Felicia. This is Greg.

23:06.998 --> 23:08.198
We're Nia's property managers.

23:08.231 --> 23:09.965
Here to assess the damage,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.368
but it looks like there isn't any.

23:12.403 --> 23:14.538
Yeah, Todd came over to help, so...

23:14.571 --> 23:16.972
Wanted to make sure she
didn't lose her security deposit.

23:17.008 --> 23:17.740
Yeah.

23:17.775 --> 23:20.576
So, uh, it was nice meeting you.

23:20.611 --> 23:22.144
Nia, check in later?

23:22.180 --> 23:24.280
Yeah, I'll walk you out.

23:28.786 --> 23:31.887
So, who's Captain Todd Walker?

23:31.923 --> 23:34.924
And why is he leaving
with all our evidence?

23:40.030 --> 23:41.597
When I got out of the shower,

23:41.632 --> 23:43.432
Rhys was on the phone speaking Punjabi.

23:43.468 --> 23:46.169
He thinks I only speak Hindi.

23:46.203 --> 23:47.002
Not that he's ever asked.

23:47.038 --> 23:47.903
And what was he saying?

23:47.939 --> 23:49.905
Apparently the diamonds in the bracelet

23:49.941 --> 23:52.174
came from India 200 years ago

23:52.210 --> 23:54.176
before the British walked
in and stole everything.

23:54.211 --> 23:55.578
So he's selling them back?

23:55.613 --> 23:57.614
He's giving them back.

23:57.647 --> 24:00.951
That little bastard.

24:00.984 --> 24:03.019
He's expanding into India.

24:03.054 --> 24:05.255
And Africa and the Middle East.

24:05.288 --> 24:08.125
To think Ben and I were just
gonna hand him that bracelet.

24:08.159 --> 24:09.425
Are you not?

24:09.460 --> 24:12.461
Certainly not... not under
the terms of our current agreement.

24:12.497 --> 24:14.263
This calls for a renegotiation.

24:15.532 --> 24:16.665
Rhys and I just had the most

24:16.701 --> 24:18.801
enlightening talk with Mickey Shive.

24:18.836 --> 24:19.970
Do you have the bracelet?

24:20.003 --> 24:21.137
Well, there's good news and bad.

24:21.172 --> 24:22.972
Mickey gave it to his boss this morning.

24:23.007 --> 24:26.542
- Emeric Shive is in town?
- Until tomorrow.

24:26.576 --> 24:28.111
Then he's leaving on a private jet.

24:28.145 --> 24:29.846
Bound for India, I expect.

24:29.881 --> 24:31.147
How did you know?

24:31.182 --> 24:32.615
What's the good news?

24:32.650 --> 24:34.116
We have until noon tomorrow
to figure out

24:34.152 --> 24:35.652
a way to steal the bracelet back.

24:35.685 --> 24:37.520
Do me a favor.

24:37.555 --> 24:40.056
When you get the
bracelet, give it to me.

24:40.090 --> 24:41.357
I'll give it to Rhys.

24:41.392 --> 24:43.192
Is that her?

24:43.227 --> 24:44.728
Don't tell me you
got to check in, as well.

24:44.761 --> 24:46.962
Got to go. Come on, before
Mickey wakes up.

24:46.998 --> 24:48.664
Oh, don't worry about that.

24:51.269 --> 24:53.202
Can't have him talking to the cops.

24:53.237 --> 24:54.557
Besides, isn't he the one that put

24:54.572 --> 24:56.072
a bullet hole in your lovely suit?

24:56.106 --> 24:59.075
Can I drive?

25:05.364 --> 25:07.298
We need to work faster.

25:10.236 --> 25:12.369
This is Mickey Shive?

25:12.403 --> 25:16.840
Two shots fired with
ballistics I've only ever seen once...

25:16.875 --> 25:19.443
in Paris...

25:19.478 --> 25:22.579
a woman named Nathalie Duchamp.

25:22.615 --> 25:26.851
And you think Shive and
this woman were killed by...

25:26.885 --> 25:28.219
Christopher Hall.

25:34.759 --> 25:36.260
Hey, what's up?

25:36.295 --> 25:38.462
Dao's here. Mickey Shive is dead.

25:38.497 --> 25:40.464
How?

25:40.499 --> 25:42.432
- What happened?
- Shot twice in the back.

25:44.103 --> 25:46.403
Dao thinks Christopher did it.

25:49.307 --> 25:52.143
I have to call you back.

25:52.177 --> 25:53.577
What are you doing here?

25:53.612 --> 25:54.412
Allie.

25:54.445 --> 25:57.182
You made me an accessory to murder.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.051
Dao gave me Shive's location.

26:01.086 --> 26:03.054
I gave it to you, and now Shive is dead.

26:03.087 --> 26:04.588
This is why I didn't want you involved.

26:04.623 --> 26:06.557
The people I work for, the people
I work with are killers.

26:06.592 --> 26:07.558
And you're not?

26:07.593 --> 26:10.127
You know I'm not.

26:10.162 --> 26:13.765
You act like I'm just supposed
to believe you.

26:13.798 --> 26:16.800
After everything you've done
to me, every lie you've told...

26:22.441 --> 26:24.142
Did you at least get the bracelet back?

26:24.175 --> 26:25.609
No.

26:25.644 --> 26:27.979
Shive gave it to his boss,

26:28.012 --> 26:29.247
who's on a flight to India tomorrow,

26:29.280 --> 26:30.913
so I have from now
until then to get it back.

26:30.939 --> 26:31.499
But you can't.

26:31.517 --> 26:33.284
Dao is watching him,
waiting for you to make your move.

26:33.318 --> 26:35.619
I can't not. My
boss needs that bracelet.

26:35.653 --> 26:37.755
So does Dao.

26:39.124 --> 26:40.991
Well, this is not gonna end well for me.

26:41.026 --> 26:43.294
Or for me.

26:45.730 --> 26:47.699
I know you don't
believe a word I'm saying,

26:47.732 --> 26:50.667
but I am sorry, Allie.

27:01.547 --> 27:03.480
Let me ask you something.

27:03.515 --> 27:05.148
What if it were possible for Dao

27:05.183 --> 27:07.285
to get his bracelet
and you to get yours?

27:07.318 --> 27:08.853
There's only one bracelet.

27:08.886 --> 27:11.189
Just like there's only one Maria Kreyn?

27:23.027 --> 27:25.327
You did not have to do this.

27:25.362 --> 27:26.863
We're a full-service security firm.

27:26.896 --> 27:27.864
Stakeouts and takeout.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.366
If you need anything, I'll
be right over there.

27:31.402 --> 27:33.001
Well, I don't need you sitting out there

27:33.037 --> 27:34.037
in front of my house all night.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.105
Why? 'Cause I'm a man?

27:36.140 --> 27:40.143
No, because I'm never gonna be
able to eat all that by myself.

27:45.148 --> 27:48.151
You're here to help, right?

27:49.552 --> 27:51.287
We are a full-service organization.

28:11.208 --> 28:12.842
Hello?

28:12.876 --> 28:15.144
Hey. Where are you?

28:15.179 --> 28:16.311
I'm on my way.

28:16.346 --> 28:17.513
What's gonig on?

28:17.548 --> 28:20.583
Army Rangers go through
regular performance reviews, right?

28:20.617 --> 28:21.984
- For promotions?
- Okay.

28:22.019 --> 28:22.951
So Nia's friend Todd

28:22.987 --> 28:25.387
got reviewed and
promoted six months early.

28:25.422 --> 28:26.756
By whom?

28:26.790 --> 28:29.159
Nia's C.O., the guy
Evan mentioned in the bar...

28:29.192 --> 28:32.228
Sergeant Joshua Moore.

28:32.262 --> 28:33.542
Do you want me to tell her or...

28:33.564 --> 28:35.431
No, I'll do it.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.432
Thanks, Soph.

28:36.467 --> 28:38.167
Yep.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.273
What'd she say?

28:44.307 --> 28:46.075
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

28:46.109 --> 28:47.210
- Nia...
- No, Shawn.

28:47.243 --> 28:50.078
You've met them both. It
isn't Todd or Sergeant Moore.

28:50.114 --> 28:52.115
Nia, I can't even imagine how
difficult this is for you.

28:52.148 --> 28:53.883
I got through Ranger school with Todd.

28:53.917 --> 28:55.852
He'd do anything for
me. I'd do anything for him.

28:55.885 --> 28:57.519
- I hope that's true.
- And Sergeant

28:57.544 --> 28:59.255
Moore wasn't forced to pass me.

28:59.289 --> 29:01.391
I got through the
course like everyone else.

29:01.424 --> 29:03.792
We're not implying that you didn't.

29:03.827 --> 29:07.230
Look... I appreciate
you guys trying to help.

29:07.263 --> 29:09.065
I do, but...

29:10.667 --> 29:12.602
You're wrong.

29:14.238 --> 29:17.574
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

29:18.642 --> 29:21.044
Let's find out.

29:21.077 --> 29:22.811
What?

29:22.846 --> 29:24.913
Let's find out if we're wrong.

29:24.949 --> 29:27.049
Let's find out if
Todd is really your friend.

29:27.084 --> 29:29.251
- How?
- Meet with him.

29:29.286 --> 29:32.989
Tell him everything... about
coming here, about us.

29:33.022 --> 29:34.557
You hired private detectives?

29:34.592 --> 29:38.094
You saw what happened to my
house, that stuff on my wall.

29:38.127 --> 29:40.596
You're not supposed to go
outside on stuff like this.

29:40.631 --> 29:42.999
You can't tell anyone. Okay?

29:48.372 --> 29:50.105
After you leave, he'll run straight

29:50.140 --> 29:52.241
to Sergeant Moore or
whoever's giving him orders.

29:52.276 --> 29:53.477
- We got a big problem.
- He'll want to

29:53.501 --> 29:54.810
calm him down, so he'll agree to meet.

29:54.845 --> 29:56.246
You got to get here right now.

29:56.279 --> 29:58.114
And when they do, we'll be there.

30:03.186 --> 30:05.520
Oh, my God.

30:05.556 --> 30:06.521
Is that...?

30:06.557 --> 30:08.625
Nia's brother.

30:08.659 --> 30:09.652
My own brother?!

30:09.676 --> 30:10.960
Look, before you say anything...

30:10.994 --> 30:12.828
Major Brooks, you don't
get to talk right now.

30:12.863 --> 30:14.297
You don't get to tell
me what to do, Ms. Vaughan.

30:14.330 --> 30:15.765
Shut up, Brian!

30:17.902 --> 30:20.036
Does Dad know about this?

30:20.069 --> 30:22.271
You gonna tell him?

30:22.306 --> 30:23.940
You sent me death threats.

30:23.973 --> 30:25.508
- Nia.
- You destroyed my house.

30:25.541 --> 30:27.609
- I was trying to protect you.
- How?

30:27.644 --> 30:29.178
By turning my friends against me?

30:29.212 --> 30:30.880
First Todd, and then my C.O.?!

30:30.914 --> 30:32.382
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

30:32.415 --> 30:34.242
You have no friends!

30:35.318 --> 30:37.353
Listen, I love you. I respect you.

30:37.387 --> 30:41.324
You are the
strongest, bravest woman I know.

30:41.357 --> 30:44.326
But you're a woman.

30:44.361 --> 30:46.296
And there are Rangers
out there who hate you

30:46.329 --> 30:48.397
because of that, who
do not have your back.

30:48.432 --> 30:51.034
And if they don't have your
back in combat, you're dead.

30:56.272 --> 30:58.173
And I don't want you to die.

31:00.743 --> 31:03.512
There are other ways you can serve.

31:09.385 --> 31:12.989
All I ever wanted to be is a Ranger.

31:13.022 --> 31:15.325
Like Dad.

31:15.358 --> 31:18.161
Like you.

31:18.194 --> 31:19.929
You are a Ranger.

31:19.963 --> 31:21.931
- Ms. Vaughan...
- It's okay, Alice.

31:21.965 --> 31:24.232
It's not okay. I'm sorry.

31:24.268 --> 31:27.170
I'm so tired of hearing men
say they are trying to protect us

31:27.203 --> 31:29.271
when what that does is
take away our choices.

31:29.306 --> 31:31.441
This is your life.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.009
These are your choices to make.

31:33.042 --> 31:34.309
But they're yours.

31:35.778 --> 31:37.046
Not his.

31:58.067 --> 31:59.969
You okay?

32:00.003 --> 32:02.038
He said he was just trying to help.

32:04.407 --> 32:06.576
So, what are you gonna do?

32:06.609 --> 32:09.112
I'm gonna go be a Ranger.

32:09.145 --> 32:13.383
And if he's right and
something happens out there,

32:13.416 --> 32:15.684
it's kind of the gig, you know?

32:17.621 --> 32:21.391
You work with some
powerful, kick-ass women.

32:21.424 --> 32:23.726
Well, that's the way I like them.

32:43.865 --> 32:45.981
I don't understand. Why
is he not picking up?

32:46.016 --> 32:48.917
- He's not picking up because...
- Benji, call me!

32:48.951 --> 32:52.387
Because I am doing the
talking for both of us.

32:55.459 --> 32:58.027
Margot.

32:58.061 --> 32:59.628
We had a deal.

32:59.663 --> 33:01.798
Yes, we had a deal to steal the bracelet

33:01.832 --> 33:03.865
from the Larรกgan Consulate in exchange

33:03.901 --> 33:05.701
for our missed payment, but now...

33:05.736 --> 33:08.371
We had a deal for the bracelet.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.472
If you want us to steal it again,

33:10.507 --> 33:13.108
then you will forgive our debt in full.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.378
It's a small price to pay for all

33:16.413 --> 33:18.580
of India, Africa, and the Middle East.

33:20.651 --> 33:22.617
- Who told you about that?
- Do we have a deal?

33:22.653 --> 33:24.554
Because, in 40 minutes, that bracelet is

33:24.587 --> 33:26.455
on its way to India without you.

33:29.559 --> 33:33.563
I am going to need this in writing.

33:37.934 --> 33:39.568
You are the absolute worst.

33:39.603 --> 33:41.336
You know that?

33:41.371 --> 33:43.905
Most people have sisters who
love them, support them.

33:43.941 --> 33:45.540
Most people don't
have you for a brother.

33:47.009 --> 33:49.345
All right. What's the plan?

33:49.378 --> 33:52.248
The plan is already in motion.

33:52.281 --> 33:53.883
We are good to go.

33:53.916 --> 33:55.518
Copy that.

34:00.223 --> 34:02.141
Eyes on Emeric Shive.

34:10.467 --> 34:12.259
_

34:13.637 --> 34:15.538
Agent Dao?

34:15.572 --> 34:17.239
Shive's hiding to the airport.

34:17.273 --> 34:18.541
I'm on my way.

34:26.916 --> 34:29.585
Welcome aboard, Mr. Shive.

34:29.619 --> 34:31.585
Champagne?

35:17.797 --> 35:19.702
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

35:19.737 --> 35:20.670
It turns out Emeric Shive has

35:20.704 --> 35:23.505
a very high tolerance
for doctored champagne.

35:23.539 --> 35:24.820
It's good to know for next time.

35:24.842 --> 35:27.309
There's not gonna be a next time.

35:27.344 --> 35:29.045
Now, you say that now...

35:35.452 --> 35:37.052
Is he here?

35:37.086 --> 35:38.721
Did you find Christopher?

35:38.755 --> 35:40.822
He didn't show.

35:40.858 --> 35:42.592
But we did find this.

35:42.626 --> 35:44.494
Hmm.

35:44.527 --> 35:47.697
We'll catch him next time.

35:47.731 --> 35:50.500
Here's to freedom.

35:52.286 --> 35:53.936
And to family.

35:53.971 --> 35:57.407
Hear, hear. To our Benefactor.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.074
Former Benefactor.

35:59.108 --> 36:01.610
Here's to India...

36:01.644 --> 36:05.715
and Africa and the Middle East.

36:06.949 --> 36:09.518
And Los Angeles.

36:11.320 --> 36:13.088
I like it here.

36:13.838 --> 36:15.731
I think I'll stay.

36:30.340 --> 36:33.041
I was sure Christopher would be there.

36:33.076 --> 36:34.744
Can you not just enjoy the fact

36:34.777 --> 36:36.813
that you arrested Emeric Shive today?

36:36.847 --> 36:39.715
And you got the bracelet back.

36:39.750 --> 36:41.650
Exactly.

36:41.684 --> 36:44.119
It was too easy.

36:44.153 --> 36:46.121
I can't help but think I'm being played.

36:46.155 --> 36:47.222
By whom?

36:47.257 --> 36:49.659
Alice? Me?

36:49.693 --> 36:52.260
Maybe.

36:52.295 --> 36:55.130
Alice plays games...

36:55.164 --> 36:57.666
while you seduce me.

36:59.635 --> 37:00.802
Is that what you think I'm doing?

37:00.838 --> 37:02.438
God, I hope so.

37:16.853 --> 37:18.855
How do I know you're not just using me?

37:21.692 --> 37:23.925
Oh, I am.

37:41.644 --> 37:43.045
Thank you...

37:43.079 --> 37:45.632
for saving my life today.

37:46.817 --> 37:48.684
It can't ever happen again.

37:50.721 --> 37:52.655
I'm lying to Val again.

37:52.688 --> 37:54.356
I'm lying to Dao.

37:57.059 --> 37:59.561
I'm in bed with the
man who ruined my life.

38:01.565 --> 38:02.735
Do you want me to leave?

38:13.342 --> 38:15.177
That's the problem.

38:31.929 --> 38:34.864
So, are you never gonna ask?

38:34.898 --> 38:36.097
Ask what?

38:36.132 --> 38:37.581
Who's better?

38:37.733 --> 38:39.702
Brother or sister?

38:39.735 --> 38:41.836
Oh, that's it.

38:41.871 --> 38:44.673
Go on. Get out of here.

38:44.708 --> 38:46.742
Bye. Safe travels.

38:46.777 --> 38:49.844
Will you visit me now that you're free?

38:49.880 --> 38:52.081
What, in India?

38:52.114 --> 38:55.284
Or Africa or the Middle East.

38:55.318 --> 38:56.619
Wow.

38:56.652 --> 38:58.353
He's put you in charge of all that?

38:58.387 --> 39:00.121
He must really trust you.

39:00.157 --> 39:01.891
Oh.

39:01.925 --> 39:04.693
As much as he trusts anyone.

39:04.728 --> 39:07.597
Watch yourself with him.

39:07.630 --> 39:11.733
I love my brother, but
he's only out for himself.

39:11.768 --> 39:13.202
Unlike the rest of us.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.143
Sleep well.

39:24.681 --> 39:27.717
You naughty girl.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.181
I was just saying goodbye.

39:31.288 --> 39:33.588
It looks like you were
doing a great deal more than that.

39:33.623 --> 39:36.224
- Rhys, I wasn't...
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:36.259 --> 39:38.226
It's late.

39:38.260 --> 39:41.764
Let's you and I go and have
a little chat while you pack.

39:54.610 --> 39:56.945
I didn't tell her about the bracelet.

40:01.717 --> 40:04.286
Hey.

40:04.320 --> 40:06.856
Hey.

40:06.889 --> 40:09.592
It's all right. I'm not angry.

40:09.626 --> 40:12.994
Well, I am a little bit.

40:13.030 --> 40:16.599
But I'll get over it.

40:16.632 --> 40:19.934
I just need a little quid pro quo.

40:19.969 --> 40:21.936
That's how it works in my family.

40:21.972 --> 40:24.606
Margot gets something on
me, I get something on her.

40:24.641 --> 40:26.809
I don't know anything.

40:29.413 --> 40:32.014
She didn't tell you
why she couldn't make

40:32.048 --> 40:35.518
this month's payment... what
went wrong on her last con?

40:35.552 --> 40:38.987
All she said was...

40:39.021 --> 40:40.188
there was a woman.

40:40.222 --> 40:41.222
Alice Vaughan?

40:41.257 --> 40:43.958
Alice Vaughan.

40:58.108 --> 41:01.911
Alice... Vaughan.

41:05.081 --> 41:07.083
Thank you, darling.

41:07.117 --> 41:08.317
That'll do nicely.

41:12.556 --> 41:14.889
Hello, Ms. Vaughan.

41:16.065 --> 41:19.027
How lovely to meet you.
