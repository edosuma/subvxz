01:07.397 --> 01:08.130
Hey.

01:08.132 --> 01:08.696
Hi.

01:08.698 --> 01:09.431
Are you John?

01:09.433 --> 01:10.032
Yeah.

01:10.034 --> 01:10.466
Hi.

01:10.468 --> 01:11.400
Annie?

01:11.402 --> 01:12.802
Yeah, that's me.

01:12.804 --> 01:14.403
You can just park
right over there.

01:14.405 --> 01:16.204
Yup, right there.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.538
OK.

01:17.540 --> 01:18.907
I'll see you inside.

01:18.909 --> 01:20.344
Yeah, I'll see you inside.

02:45.462 --> 02:45.963
John!

02:49.433 --> 02:50.433
You can just get settled in.

02:50.435 --> 02:52.233
I'll be there in a sec.

02:52.235 --> 02:52.935
OK.

02:52.937 --> 02:54.403
I'm in the living room.

02:54.405 --> 02:56.804
Sorry?

02:56.806 --> 02:58.406
In the living room!

03:03.715 --> 03:05.479
I see you're,
uh, already getting

03:05.481 --> 03:06.415
acquainted with the place.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.583
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:07.585 --> 03:08.851
It's, uh...

03:08.853 --> 03:12.554
Bleak, unsettling,
lacking personality?

03:12.556 --> 03:14.322
It's familiar.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.325
Vacation home, right?

03:18.062 --> 03:22.798
It's nice... the
water and the woods.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.733
It's peaceful.

03:24.735 --> 03:27.938
Reminds me of a house I
used to visit as a kid.

03:31.542 --> 03:32.043
Annie?

03:34.611 --> 03:36.544
Annie?

03:36.546 --> 03:37.880
Hey.

03:37.882 --> 03:39.481
Everything all right?

03:39.483 --> 03:42.650
Everything's fine.

03:42.652 --> 03:47.623
Why don't you call me Anne.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.157
Anne.

03:49.159 --> 03:50.226
Sounds good.

03:50.228 --> 03:52.193
Great.

03:52.195 --> 03:54.129
By the way, I
wanted to thank you.

03:54.131 --> 03:55.430
Gary said you had to
pull a lot of strings

03:55.432 --> 03:57.566
with your girlfriend
to get the time off.

03:57.568 --> 03:58.600
I really appreciate it.

03:58.602 --> 03:59.635
Oh, absolutely.

03:59.637 --> 04:02.404
It's no problem, really.

04:02.406 --> 04:03.672
Could use the hours.

04:03.674 --> 04:04.175
Oh.

04:10.213 --> 04:13.916
Uh, let me just
get this to the car

04:13.918 --> 04:15.650
and I'll show you around
if there's time, OK?

04:15.652 --> 04:16.385
All right.

04:16.387 --> 04:16.952
Let me help.

04:16.954 --> 04:17.652
No, no, no, no.

04:17.654 --> 04:18.420
It's fine.

04:18.422 --> 04:19.421
It's not heavy.

04:19.423 --> 04:19.958
All right.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.327
What's up?

06:39.329 --> 06:41.829
Pipes might be
getting a little rusty.

06:41.831 --> 06:43.264
Oh.

06:43.266 --> 06:46.067
This whole place is
falling apart at the core.

06:46.069 --> 06:49.971
It's been around a
really long time.

06:49.973 --> 06:52.875
Never got to renovate.

06:52.877 --> 06:56.178
We had such grand
plans for this place.

06:56.180 --> 06:57.081
Didn't we, Agnes?

07:04.322 --> 07:09.060
I'm John, the intern
nurse from Homefront.

07:13.564 --> 07:18.302
Um, I'll be assisting you for a
short while while Anne is away.

07:21.038 --> 07:23.305
She's a little worn
down from the road.

07:23.307 --> 07:25.139
I don't think she can hear you.

07:25.141 --> 07:27.377
I can hear him just fine.

07:33.384 --> 07:37.485
I distinctly remember
asking Homefront

07:37.487 --> 07:46.327
for an able-bodied man, not
a green, sickly looking kid.

07:48.798 --> 07:50.798
That's a long line of these...

07:50.800 --> 07:51.666
these faggot...

07:51.668 --> 07:52.567
OK.

07:52.569 --> 07:54.235
Let's get you to bed.

07:54.237 --> 07:56.772
The last thing
I need to hear

07:56.774 --> 07:58.774
before I drop dread is whining.

07:58.776 --> 07:59.608
Whining?

07:59.610 --> 08:00.642
Yes.

08:00.644 --> 08:01.675
Look at him.

08:01.677 --> 08:04.846
He looks weak.

08:04.848 --> 08:08.983
Annie, Annie, Annie.

08:08.985 --> 08:10.586
He's weak.

08:10.588 --> 08:12.954
He's weak.

08:12.956 --> 08:15.057
You stay here!

08:15.059 --> 08:16.925
You stay with me!

08:16.927 --> 08:19.293
I said you stay.

08:19.295 --> 08:19.860
No.

08:19.862 --> 08:20.961
I said you stay.

08:20.963 --> 08:21.930
No!

08:21.932 --> 08:23.430
No!

08:23.432 --> 08:24.899
No!

08:24.901 --> 08:25.899
No!

08:25.901 --> 08:28.503
No!

08:30.574 --> 08:32.274
You can't do
this to me anymore.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.876
No, no, no, I don't
want to hear it.

08:34.879 --> 08:36.477
I don't want to hear it.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.381
No, no.

09:20.725 --> 09:22.225
You're gonna do great.

12:38.422 --> 12:40.855
Just... look, I can help you.

12:41.292 --> 12:42.257
Stop.

12:52.201 --> 12:53.334
Stop!

12:53.336 --> 12:55.840
I said stop, you
goddamn imbecile.

13:08.751 --> 13:10.719
You can't stand.

13:10.721 --> 13:13.689
What?

13:13.691 --> 13:16.123
Stand.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.325
Or are you as weak as useless?

13:18.327 --> 13:21.698
Can't lift 100-pound lady.

13:28.004 --> 13:31.238
Look, I'm just trying to help.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.574
OK?

13:32.576 --> 13:35.475
You do more harm, boy.

13:35.477 --> 13:37.447
Just go right there.

13:43.653 --> 13:44.353
OK.

13:44.355 --> 13:44.855
I'm here.

14:02.172 --> 14:04.508
Thanks for the
help, you faggot.

14:12.581 --> 14:15.583
Go wash your hands.

14:15.585 --> 14:19.621
You're still fucking weak.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.043
You hear?

15:39.470 --> 15:42.469
I heard.

15:45.875 --> 15:49.176
The strange
noises in the house?

15:49.178 --> 15:55.050
He's here in the autumn.

15:55.052 --> 15:55.552
The noises?

15:58.221 --> 15:59.088
The frost.

16:06.363 --> 16:12.199
I'll take that walk now.

16:12.201 --> 16:14.268
Yeah.

16:14.270 --> 16:16.271
Yeah.

16:45.034 --> 16:51.841
I never noticed how the
cold air tickles your lungs.

16:57.947 --> 17:01.215
So good.

17:07.624 --> 17:11.459
- Feel good, isn't it?
- Mm.

17:11.461 --> 17:12.127
It does.

20:03.366 --> 20:04.699
Hey.

20:04.701 --> 20:06.500
Hope you're doing all
right with your patient,

20:06.502 --> 20:08.068
not having too hard a time.

20:08.070 --> 20:11.472
Oh, ran into Mike, and he
told me he has that thing

20:11.474 --> 20:13.007
you asked him to get.

20:13.009 --> 20:14.909
He said you'd understand.

20:14.911 --> 20:16.776
Are you up to no good?

20:16.778 --> 20:19.846
I know you are.

20:19.848 --> 20:22.682
Anyways, I miss you.

20:22.684 --> 20:23.884
Come home soon.

20:23.886 --> 20:28.190
And give me a call
back or whatever.

20:28.192 --> 20:29.623
Let's see.

20:29.625 --> 20:30.857
Oh.

20:30.859 --> 20:32.559
And I love you.

20:32.561 --> 20:33.062
Bye.

21:27.183 --> 21:29.252
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

21:33.722 --> 21:35.224
Where are we, Afghanistan?

22:03.886 --> 22:04.885
Hey.

22:04.887 --> 22:06.720
Hey, hon.

22:06.722 --> 22:07.622
Hey!

22:07.624 --> 22:08.721
Hey!

22:08.723 --> 22:09.891
Yes.

22:12.095 --> 22:16.729
I... I've been trying to get
a signal for the last hour.

22:16.731 --> 22:17.632
Oh.

22:19.602 --> 22:20.768
Ah.

22:21.369 --> 22:22.036
Oh.

22:22.038 --> 22:22.937
I didn't mean that.

22:22.939 --> 22:23.970
Of course I miss you.

22:23.972 --> 22:26.807
I'm just exhausted is all.

22:26.809 --> 22:28.343
Yeah?

22:28.345 --> 22:29.576
Yeah.

22:29.578 --> 22:30.612
Patient?

22:30.614 --> 22:33.948
Yee-Agnes.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.853
Oh, I don't know.

22:39.855 --> 22:44.793
She's, uh... she's
perky most of the time.

22:44.795 --> 22:46.760
Dementia is definitely
creeping in.

22:46.762 --> 22:52.232
She mumbles incoherent
things, constant fits of SOB,

22:52.234 --> 22:55.469
and her hands and feet
are freezing all the time.

22:55.471 --> 22:56.470
So...

23:00.576 --> 23:01.575
No.

23:01.577 --> 23:04.178
I... I don't know.

23:04.180 --> 23:06.383
Like I said, a couple days.

23:09.819 --> 23:11.552
Uh, whatever, though.

23:11.554 --> 23:14.389
You know, we'll see.

23:14.391 --> 23:18.660
Just get this
done, get my bonus.

23:18.662 --> 23:20.260
It was worth it, right?

23:20.262 --> 23:21.298
Yeah.

23:33.242 --> 23:33.542
Yeah.

23:37.980 --> 23:40.381
Read me something.

23:51.394 --> 23:52.360
Shh.

23:56.700 --> 23:58.533
Yeah.

23:58.535 --> 23:59.199
Shit.

23:59.201 --> 24:01.436
I think I hear her.

24:01.438 --> 24:02.236
I got to go, hon.

24:02.238 --> 24:05.605
Uh, I love you.
All right.

24:05.607 --> 24:07.341
I'll... I'll call you
as soon as I can.

24:07.343 --> 24:07.644
Bye.

24:46.383 --> 24:46.682
More?

24:59.695 --> 25:00.196
More?

25:08.538 --> 25:15.441
Um, I feel nothing.

25:15.443 --> 25:23.851
This... this is all
so goddamn useless.

25:32.061 --> 25:32.561
What?

25:36.566 --> 25:42.836
I must have spent
hours yesterday

25:42.838 --> 25:47.307
screaming, yelling for help.

25:52.816 --> 25:55.248
I'm sorry.

25:55.250 --> 25:57.718
Agnes, I'm sorry.

25:57.720 --> 26:00.390
Moments left.

26:04.759 --> 26:18.805
I can feel the darkness
creeping, tingling in me,

26:18.807 --> 26:32.689
smell it, cast off, empty, o...

26:35.724 --> 26:38.992
ostracized...

26:42.298 --> 26:52.605
...in the company of an
incompetent,

26:52.607 --> 27:01.217
faggot of a moron
here to assist me.

27:04.621 --> 27:06.987
Kill me.

27:06.989 --> 27:09.590
Just shoot me.

27:16.699 --> 27:25.909
Mother's milk hasn't dried
from around nose, lips...

27:30.278 --> 27:34.081
still suckling.

28:08.984 --> 28:09.885
How silly.

28:13.388 --> 28:23.162
Floating away with
the winter's songbird

28:23.164 --> 28:27.236
into the southern summers.

28:38.448 --> 28:46.523
It's... it's freezing.

28:55.431 --> 29:03.907
So bad... terrible
memories in this house.

29:09.813 --> 29:13.416
They will never leave.

30:39.201 --> 30:39.702
Hey.

30:46.608 --> 30:48.110
Well, this isn't weird at all.

32:20.068 --> 32:21.469
I'm going to die now.

32:21.471 --> 32:24.270
Swear it.

32:24.272 --> 32:25.538
Swear it is.

32:25.540 --> 32:27.408
You take it for granted.

32:32.615 --> 32:33.514
Oh, sorry.

32:33.516 --> 32:35.515
I must have dozed off.

32:35.517 --> 32:36.452
You get down here...

32:41.656 --> 32:43.222
you get up yourself?

32:43.224 --> 32:45.225
Of course you got up yourself.

32:45.227 --> 32:46.496
How you feeling?

32:50.700 --> 32:51.798
Agnes, you're bleeding.

32:52.567 --> 32:55.469
What's going on here?

32:55.471 --> 32:56.236
You're hurt?

32:56.238 --> 32:58.238
You're bleeding.

32:58.240 --> 32:58.873
It's OK.

32:58.875 --> 32:59.706
Hold on.

32:59.708 --> 33:01.908
Don't get all sensitive on me.

33:01.910 --> 33:05.278
A little blood to
your whole pack.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.212
All right.

33:06.214 --> 33:08.149
What are the results?

33:08.151 --> 33:10.851
Does it hurt anywhere?

33:13.189 --> 33:15.956
Agnes, does it hurt anywhere?

33:15.958 --> 33:18.292
Everywhere.

33:18.294 --> 33:21.460
Oh, Jesus, Agnes.

33:21.462 --> 33:27.000
Jesus, God, the Holy Spirit.

33:27.002 --> 33:27.901
You stupid.

33:27.903 --> 33:28.334
No!

33:29.271 --> 33:30.470
Whoa.

33:30.472 --> 33:32.639
Your frantic
religious propaganda.

33:32.641 --> 33:34.207
Your holy bible.

33:34.209 --> 33:35.545
You're a pussy!

33:42.884 --> 33:45.821
What... what's the matter?

33:51.326 --> 33:54.864
I always wanted kids, you know?

33:58.067 --> 34:05.739
It's true I had their
names planned out.

34:05.741 --> 34:18.016
I was going to make my daughter
Penelope and my son John.

34:18.018 --> 34:18.320
Yeah.

34:23.726 --> 34:27.797
So much time withered away.

34:33.668 --> 34:35.337
I envy your youth.

34:39.007 --> 34:41.775
Don't waste it.

34:41.777 --> 34:42.878
I don't intend to.

34:51.588 --> 34:58.691
6:00 AM every morning
I used to force myself...

34:58.693 --> 35:03.199
wake up, run, and racing.

35:06.768 --> 35:10.037
Against what?

35:10.039 --> 35:13.206
Time, perhaps?

35:13.208 --> 35:15.543
Life?

35:15.545 --> 35:22.085
Always chasing our
time, trying to keep up.

35:27.722 --> 35:31.059
And then I saw her.

35:41.436 --> 35:47.340
It finds us all.

35:59.889 --> 36:08.664
This house, it's
been so good to me.

36:13.501 --> 36:17.037
I got you.

36:17.039 --> 36:18.438
Shh.

36:18.440 --> 36:19.940
Shh.

36:19.942 --> 36:20.242
Shh.

36:42.197 --> 36:43.231
You know Morse.

36:48.971 --> 36:55.809
Three short taps is an
S. Two would be an I.

36:55.811 --> 36:58.811
I was an Eagle Scout at the...

36:58.813 --> 37:02.717
I'm a radio merit badge.

37:02.719 --> 37:08.354
Do they give out
hunting badges there too?

37:08.356 --> 37:08.858
No.

37:12.427 --> 37:14.628
Well, good.

37:19.434 --> 37:19.936
Here.

37:42.324 --> 37:43.324
I got you.

37:43.326 --> 37:45.291
I got you.

37:45.293 --> 37:46.358
You're OK.

37:46.360 --> 37:46.862
OK.

38:00.643 --> 38:04.209
Could you please come back?

38:04.211 --> 38:04.514
Sit.

38:11.519 --> 38:14.487
I don't like you very much.

38:14.489 --> 38:16.523
I don't pretend.

38:16.525 --> 38:18.458
I don't hide my...

38:18.460 --> 38:19.494
my feelings for you.

38:23.731 --> 38:30.306
But I'm not always myself.

38:33.342 --> 38:39.182
I know I just try my
hardest to be your friend.

38:42.083 --> 38:46.686
It's just a job for you.

38:46.688 --> 38:48.722
Everyone has one.

38:48.724 --> 38:53.392
Well, see, I personally see
it as more than just a job.

38:53.394 --> 38:54.427
It's more of...

38:54.429 --> 38:56.996
Just listen.

38:56.998 --> 38:57.966
Listen to me.

39:02.503 --> 39:11.378
Our feelings aside, we're
stuck together, you and I,

39:11.380 --> 39:15.849
at least until Annie
decides to stop punishing

39:15.851 --> 39:21.188
or whatever she's
trying to achieve.

39:21.190 --> 39:26.260
Until then, it's
you walking paradox.

39:33.068 --> 39:39.206
If this little predicament
of the situation

39:39.208 --> 39:42.445
is still the same
when I am ready...

39:47.048 --> 39:52.952
you're a good boy, aren't you?

39:52.954 --> 39:57.824
Please, do me a favor.

39:57.826 --> 39:58.691
Of course, Agnes.

39:58.693 --> 40:00.927
It's what I'm here for.

40:02.864 --> 40:03.932
Bury me.

40:07.135 --> 40:10.604
Just... just listen to me.

40:10.606 --> 40:14.307
It's a very simple process.

40:14.309 --> 40:19.211
It requires just some
physical strength,

40:19.213 --> 40:22.916
maybe, maybe just common sense.

40:22.918 --> 40:23.452
That's all.

40:26.454 --> 40:33.092
Agnes, um, I'm a nurse,
not a... not a grave digger,

40:33.094 --> 40:35.494
not an undertaker.

40:35.496 --> 40:36.996
I'm a nurse, OK?

40:36.998 --> 40:38.030
I'm sorry.

40:38.032 --> 40:40.467
Shovel the back of the house.

40:40.469 --> 40:41.635
It's very...

40:41.637 --> 40:42.336
I won't.

40:42.338 --> 40:42.869
...very...

40:42.871 --> 40:43.635
I refuse...

40:43.637 --> 40:44.537
Use shovel...

40:44.539 --> 40:45.673
...to bury you, Agnes.

40:45.675 --> 40:49.642
...just... just three
paces from the big tree,

40:49.644 --> 40:53.246
any direction but
east, at least four...

40:53.248 --> 40:57.117
four feet beneath ground level.

40:57.119 --> 41:00.554
You show your crucifix.

41:00.556 --> 41:05.258
You're superstitious...
your whole book.

41:05.260 --> 41:10.229
I have my own beliefs,
my own rituals.

41:10.231 --> 41:13.800
Don't I deserve my faith John?

41:13.802 --> 41:15.735
Don't I this...

41:15.737 --> 41:17.304
You do, OK.

41:17.306 --> 41:18.070
You do.

41:18.072 --> 41:20.641
Everybody deserves faith.

41:20.643 --> 41:24.811
But there are ways, ways that
this can be done properly.

41:24.813 --> 41:26.012
OK.

41:26.014 --> 41:27.014
There are people
that you can contact,

41:27.016 --> 41:28.213
people that we can contact.

41:28.215 --> 41:31.050
If you haven't already, we can.

41:31.052 --> 41:33.219
They will defile it.

41:33.221 --> 41:41.360
My soul, my body, it
has meaning, importance.

41:41.362 --> 41:42.731
Agnes, I just don't care.

41:52.206 --> 41:54.941
I don't have choice but you.

41:56.679 --> 41:59.045
John.

41:59.047 --> 42:00.646
John.

42:00.648 --> 42:02.648
John.

42:29.577 --> 42:30.943
John.

42:30.945 --> 42:32.412
John.

42:32.414 --> 42:42.722
I can't sleep,
tearin' at the walled up one.

42:42.724 --> 42:52.699
I can't breathe, tearin'
at the walled up one.

42:52.701 --> 42:56.172
How many times you
tell me that I can...

43:12.887 --> 43:13.519
Why?

43:16.891 --> 43:23.832
Why did you leave me all alone?

43:27.168 --> 43:35.508
I'm... I'm sorry, so sorry.

43:35.510 --> 43:38.512
I am.

43:38.514 --> 43:41.313
Please.

43:41.315 --> 43:44.217
Please come back.

43:48.157 --> 43:50.557
Please.

43:50.559 --> 43:50.860
Please.

43:57.266 --> 44:01.336
What have I done to deserve?

44:19.721 --> 44:22.121
Please.

44:22.123 --> 44:22.625
Please.

44:55.324 --> 44:56.289
God damn.

44:56.291 --> 44:57.757
Come on.
Fuck.

44:57.759 --> 44:59.092
Piece of shit.

44:59.094 --> 45:00.059
Fuck.

45:00.061 --> 45:01.994
Bastard.

45:03.331 --> 45:05.264
I've sinned.

45:05.266 --> 45:07.200
Oh God, I've sinned.

45:07.202 --> 45:10.737
I have sinned.

45:10.739 --> 45:16.608
I've sinned to have judged in
others, their stubbornness,

45:16.610 --> 45:22.617
pride, anger, and difference.

45:29.157 --> 45:33.963
All these sins I
repent, beg forgiveness.

46:13.034 --> 46:14.166
Annie.
Hi.

46:14.168 --> 46:16.536
Uh, John here.

46:16.538 --> 46:18.170
I've been trying to reach
you for a few days now.

46:18.172 --> 46:21.276
I really didn't want to do
this over voicemail, but, um...

46:26.148 --> 46:31.483
uh, Agnes's time is running
out, and I'm doing all

46:31.485 --> 46:34.820
I can to keep her comfortable.

46:34.822 --> 46:37.155
I think she's holding
on to see you.

46:37.157 --> 46:38.758
Calls out your name a lot.

46:43.632 --> 46:47.336
If you want to see her, the
time is pretty much now.

46:51.539 --> 46:54.340
Uh, also I have a question
about funeral arrangements.

46:54.342 --> 46:56.443
Again, I'm very sorry
to have to leave

46:56.445 --> 46:59.146
this message on your phone.

46:59.148 --> 47:02.883
Um, I'd much rather
do it in person.

47:02.885 --> 47:03.883
All right.

47:03.885 --> 47:05.217
Well, call me when
you get a chance.

47:35.382 --> 47:37.452
Thank you for...

50:56.284 --> 50:56.785
Fuck!

51:19.273 --> 51:21.874
Damn it.

51:21.876 --> 51:22.177
Fuck!

52:08.222 --> 52:08.690
Anne.

52:13.193 --> 52:13.996
Is she peaceful?

52:16.530 --> 52:20.432
It was peaceful, right?

52:20.434 --> 52:21.733
Yeah.

52:21.735 --> 52:23.371
It was peaceful.

52:28.777 --> 52:29.344
I'm sorry.

52:33.782 --> 52:37.717
Please accept my
condolences for your loss.

52:37.719 --> 52:39.918
I hate to have to
ask you this now,

52:39.920 --> 52:41.887
uh, but my car won't start.

52:41.889 --> 52:45.257
So I was hoping I could ask
you for a ride into town,

52:45.259 --> 52:48.664
or if you have jumper
cables, I could try those.

52:52.032 --> 52:52.731
OK.

52:52.733 --> 52:54.499
Great.

52:53.601 --> 52:54.566
I just need to, um...

52:54.568 --> 52:55.568
I need to find something.

52:55.570 --> 52:56.469
I'll be quick.

52:56.471 --> 52:58.403
I promise.

52:58.405 --> 53:05.311
Uh, and you did make
funeral arrangements?

53:05.313 --> 53:06.512
OK.
Good.

53:06.514 --> 53:08.313
That's good.

53:08.315 --> 53:12.485
Four feet under, three
paces from the big tree,

53:12.487 --> 53:15.787
any direction but east.

53:15.789 --> 53:18.758
I have to start digging
before the ground freezes.

53:18.760 --> 53:19.992
What?

53:19.994 --> 53:21.360
The frost is here.

53:21.362 --> 53:22.695
The earth will get stiff.

53:22.697 --> 53:24.764
I'm not sure I follow you.

53:26.034 --> 53:31.970
She drove me crazy
picking out shovels.

53:31.972 --> 53:37.642
Here, normal people are buying
Christmas trees and ornaments,

53:37.644 --> 53:39.744
colorful, decorative lights.

53:39.746 --> 53:43.548
I'm looking for the
best shovel they got.

53:50.057 --> 53:54.360
My mom died when I
was a little girl.

53:54.362 --> 53:57.429
I was two, I think.

53:57.431 --> 54:03.436
I don't remember her or
feeling much of anything.

54:03.438 --> 54:08.441
Agnes, though, I remember her.

54:08.443 --> 54:11.409
She was always around.

54:11.411 --> 54:14.813
When someone talks about
mothers, it's her face I see,

54:14.815 --> 54:16.917
always watchful and loving.

54:19.454 --> 54:24.557
She's made me into the
proper young lady I am.

54:29.829 --> 54:31.396
Watch your posture!

54:32.333 --> 54:37.003
No hands on the
dining room table!

54:37.005 --> 54:40.472
We don't slurp our tea.

54:40.474 --> 54:41.942
No talking at dinner!

54:44.978 --> 54:47.848
Do you have any idea how
somber dinner was at our house?

54:50.452 --> 54:52.117
Treasure your youth,
she used to tell me,

54:52.119 --> 54:55.220
it's the only thing
you've got that matters.

54:55.222 --> 54:57.389
She used to say
I'd give anything

54:57.391 --> 55:01.561
to see through your eyes
or hear through your ears.

55:01.563 --> 55:04.499
Life is a gift and we
never throw gifts away.

55:09.302 --> 55:12.871
Anne, I'm sorry,
for everything.

55:12.873 --> 55:14.740
No one lives forever.

55:14.742 --> 55:16.575
Death finds us all.

55:16.577 --> 55:20.646
I'd like to get my car
started as soon as I can.

55:20.648 --> 55:22.550
- She's evil.
- What?

55:25.452 --> 55:27.720
She's evil, John.

55:27.722 --> 55:32.356
She's committed
unspeakable acts.

55:32.358 --> 55:34.325
Anne, I understand
that you're very...

55:34.327 --> 55:37.528
No, heinous crimes,
committed for the sake

55:37.530 --> 55:38.930
of meaningless shit.

55:38.932 --> 55:40.499
I understand
that you're upset.

55:40.501 --> 55:41.867
Would you kill someone to buy
yourself a little more time?

55:41.869 --> 55:42.900
- I get it.
- Would you?

55:42.902 --> 55:45.271
But we need to go.

55:45.273 --> 55:47.740
I wanted to have her arrested.

55:47.742 --> 55:51.677
I did, I swear I wanted to.

55:51.679 --> 55:56.916
I dialed the nine, but my
hand would start to shake.

55:56.918 --> 55:59.485
I got passed the nine once.

55:59.487 --> 56:03.124
And she was already dying,
and she's all I know.

56:05.960 --> 56:08.693
We find ways to justify
the worst in the people

56:08.695 --> 56:15.066
that we love, and we
sacrifice our life for them.

56:15.068 --> 56:17.369
She was evil, John.

56:17.371 --> 56:18.070
That's enough.

56:18.072 --> 56:19.405
Sacrificial rituals.

56:19.407 --> 56:20.075
That's enough!

56:25.545 --> 56:26.447
Thank you.

56:30.550 --> 56:32.318
Thank you, John.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.985
For what?

56:33.987 --> 56:35.887
For being so good.

56:35.889 --> 56:39.492
- I couldn't.
- OK.

56:39.494 --> 56:40.860
You're welcome, Anne.

56:40.862 --> 56:45.930
You know, once I knew, once
I knew for sure what she did...

56:45.932 --> 56:48.233
OK.
She is gone.

56:48.235 --> 56:50.769
Everything is behind you.

56:50.771 --> 56:53.271
It's all over.

56:53.273 --> 56:54.273
OK?

56:54.275 --> 56:55.074
It's OK.

57:01.648 --> 57:02.150
Anne.

57:06.855 --> 57:12.825
I left a small ring box in
her room on the windowsill.

57:12.827 --> 57:15.161
I'll be right back.

57:15.163 --> 57:16.431
Don't go anywhere.

57:38.219 --> 57:39.017
Hey!

57:39.019 --> 57:41.586
Stop!

57:41.588 --> 57:43.588
You're crazy.

57:43.590 --> 57:47.392
You're all goddamn crazy.

58:23.731 --> 58:24.232
Fuck.

01:00:32.592 --> 01:00:37.929
Good Fantastic.

01:00:37.931 --> 01:00:40.901
You are so good, boys.

01:00:43.436 --> 01:00:46.938
Naturally talented, aren't we?

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.775
We have some tools.

01:00:52.211 --> 01:00:59.017
Now, I want you to
place it right here.

01:00:59.019 --> 01:01:01.519
Do not move.

01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:06.226
Thomas, now, we touch it.

01:01:21.509 --> 01:01:26.077
We're going to play a game.

01:01:26.079 --> 01:01:26.581
OK?

01:04:28.929 --> 01:04:31.563
Hey.

01:04:31.565 --> 01:04:34.132
Hey, I heard you.

01:04:34.134 --> 01:04:36.133
Who's up there?

01:04:38.871 --> 01:04:39.537
Hey.

01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:46.311
Stop.

01:04:46.313 --> 01:04:46.814
Stop.

01:05:46.974 --> 01:05:49.208
Strike you.

01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:49.710
Protect.

01:07:30.476 --> 01:07:30.978
Fuck.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.401
Hey!

01:08:35.376 --> 01:08:36.277
Somebody!

01:08:46.386 --> 01:08:46.886
Help!

01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.823
Are you listening?

01:09:31.596 --> 01:09:41.505
She will come, John.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.646
John.

01:13:08.648 --> 01:13:10.848
May Lord be with you, Satan.

01:13:32.773 --> 01:13:34.171
Satan.

01:13:34.173 --> 01:13:35.676
Lord will be with you.

01:14:09.609 --> 01:14:14.579
I can smell your thoughts.

01:14:14.581 --> 01:14:16.580
Is it true?

01:14:16.582 --> 01:14:23.056
You're thinking I am hell.

01:14:27.926 --> 01:14:33.130
Don't I deserve my
own faith, John?

01:14:33.132 --> 01:14:38.835
Don't I deserve my own faith?

01:14:38.837 --> 01:14:47.211
Don't I deserve my
own faith, John?

01:15:53.447 --> 01:15:53.747
Fuck.

01:18:33.273 --> 01:18:33.774
Help!

01:19:18.917 --> 01:19:19.418
Annie.

01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:24.821
How long have you been here?

01:19:27.025 --> 01:19:27.759
I thought you left.

01:19:27.761 --> 01:19:30.495
Oh, hurry.

01:19:30.497 --> 01:19:32.566
And what the fuck
is going on here?

01:19:37.938 --> 01:19:38.936
Fuck.

01:19:38.938 --> 01:19:40.071
We have to go.

01:19:40.073 --> 01:19:41.037
We have to go.

01:19:41.039 --> 01:19:43.307
Annie, what is going on?

01:19:43.309 --> 01:19:45.878
- We have to go.
- Annie!

01:19:49.515 --> 01:19:52.884
What the fuck is
going on, Annie?

01:19:52.886 --> 01:19:53.718
Tell me!

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:56.454
We have to bury the body now.

01:19:56.456 --> 01:19:57.921
Agnes isn't dead.

01:19:57.923 --> 01:19:58.656
Do you hear me?

01:19:58.658 --> 01:20:00.058
- She is alive.
- Oh no.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.058
Oh no.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:02.562
You poor thing.

01:20:15.742 --> 01:20:18.977
You must have changed
names, addresses,

01:20:18.979 --> 01:20:21.579
your whole lifestyle.

01:20:21.581 --> 01:20:31.121
You were just a kid.

01:21:22.841 --> 01:21:25.777
She killed him.

01:21:25.779 --> 01:21:28.446
It was her.

01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:29.850
She got into him.

01:21:33.452 --> 01:21:34.721
She killed him.

01:22:14.327 --> 01:22:16.559
I swear to you...

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:21.464
I swear to you, Lucifer.

01:22:24.936 --> 01:22:30.540
Hide the darkness over your face
on account of your arrogance.

01:22:32.779 --> 01:22:37.647
I expel you in all
of the fallen hearse,

01:22:37.649 --> 01:22:39.016
which follow in your will.

01:22:39.018 --> 01:22:42.352
I expel you, the
spirit of uncleanliness

01:22:42.354 --> 01:22:50.561
revolted against the omnipotent
God and the army of his angels.

01:23:21.594 --> 01:23:23.563
Live forever.

01:23:24.697 --> 01:23:32.370
In the name of the
father, the son...

01:23:32.372 --> 01:23:34.205
You are...

01:23:34.207 --> 01:23:36.206
...and the Holy Spirit.

01:23:36.208 --> 01:23:38.209
...Duram

01:23:38.211 --> 01:23:39.112
Oh God.

01:24:37.536 --> 01:24:40.140
It is raining outside.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.711
And the sun is long gone.

01:24:48.613 --> 01:24:51.283
I sense that you
can read my mind.

01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:56.355
But all my thoughts are forgone.

01:24:59.958 --> 01:25:06.396
A pretty rose on
my chest you placed

01:25:06.398 --> 01:25:09.866
with such care and grace.

01:25:09.868 --> 01:25:18.375
The things around me come past
and you pour more gasoline

01:25:18.377 --> 01:25:22.345
on me, like I'm possessed.

01:25:22.347 --> 01:25:30.990
I really hope this is a dream,
imagination of the mind.

01:25:33.626 --> 01:25:36.730
My soul, it can't be sacrificed.

01:25:39.399 --> 01:25:41.232
It's nothing special.

01:25:41.234 --> 01:25:42.068
It is blind.

01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:47.807
But here I am, my
hands are numb.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:54.878
And I hear the sound
of distant cries.

01:25:54.880 --> 01:26:00.183
I can't resist and I succumb.

01:26:00.185 --> 01:26:07.693
Then, someone whispers in my
ear, "Don't open your eyes."

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:12.695
