WEBVTT

00:36.370 --> 00:40.739
NORMAN: Okay, my idea is, we ﬁnd someone
like a Jo Wi/f, or an Arthur Taub

00:41.125 --> 00:48.088
and we get them to buy about
$300 million of debt

00:48.966 --> 00:51.457
and then pay 80-90 cents on the dollar.

00:51.760 --> 00:56.220
And let’s say it’s Jo Wilf,
he walks away with $30—40 mil/ion.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.933
This is good. I’ve thought it through, lknow.

01:01.019 --> 01:03.180
/ just got to ﬁnd someone
who can actually do this.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.655
/ take my seven percent.
You set it up, you get a ﬁnder’s fee...

01:14.742 --> 01:16.323
It’s a lot of money.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.904
And everybody wins.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.837
Isn't this the scale?

01:32.009 --> 01:34.876
The kind of deal that
Jo Wilf is looking for right now?

01:35.763 --> 01:36.878
Yeah...

01:37.014 --> 01:40.723
Yes, but I don't have direct contact with Wilf.
You know that, right?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.549
Yeah, but you have friends there. Don't you?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.681
I mean, this is your circle, right?

01:45.856 --> 01:46.845
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.349
Yeah. Bill Kavish. You know him?

01:50.444 --> 01:51.934
He works for Wilf. He is a friend.

01:52.029 --> 01:54.020
-Yeah.
-Do you know his name?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.445
-Maybe.
-You know his family.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.692
His father was Henry Kavish.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.740
You remember him?
He got into some kind of trouble.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.199
Oh, yeah.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.699
He was caught taking some money.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.247
I don't know exactly
what happened there, but...

02:06.877 --> 02:07.957
He was fired.

02:08.337 --> 02:11.204
His wife left him.
Kids turned their backs on him.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.167
He died alone and penniless.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.710
-Bill is his youngest son.
-lntroduce me to Bill.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.304
I can give you his e-mail,

02:25.395 --> 02:28.262
but I prefer not to send
a formal introduction, you know?

02:29.274 --> 02:31.060
We represent clients
that do business with them...

02:31.151 --> 02:33.142
I don't want to look like
I'm asking him for a favor.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.397
Can I say that we're related?

02:35.197 --> 02:36.733
-Can I say that I'm your uncle?
-No.

02:36.907 --> 02:40.399
No. No. Don't make it a family thing.
It doesn't sound good.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.566
Uh...

02:43.247 --> 02:45.078
It might not be a good idea
to mention my name.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.288
Okay, you can say you know me.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.538
Yeah, but please don't tell him
you got his address from me.

02:54.925 --> 02:55.914
-Okay?
-Yeah.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.761
Look, I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
ltstough.

03:02.683 --> 03:06.596
You're like a drowning man
trying to wave at an ocean liner.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.770
Jo Wilf is an ocean liner.
He doesn't see any of us. (CHUCKLES)

03:10.607 --> 03:11.813
But I'm a good swimmer.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.060
-Yeah.
-Don't forget that.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.939
As long as my head is above water...

03:17.364 --> 03:18.604
(KISSES)

03:48.604 --> 03:49.810
Good morning, Bill.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.428
Norman Oppenheimer.

03:51.523 --> 03:52.933
What the fuck? Are you stalking me now?

03:53.025 --> 03:54.890
No, ljust need
a couple of minutes of your time.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.145
I know you're busy.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.225
Philip Cohen might have mentioned me.

03:57.321 --> 03:58.857
No. This is my private time.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.987
Please respect that. Call the office.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.365
Does Philip know you're here?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.867
-How did you even find me?
-lt's just a business opportunity.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.536
Look, lwouldn't be here
if it wasn't time-sensitive. Let me explain.

04:08.624 --> 04:09.989
-Give me one minute.
-No.

04:10.334 --> 04:13.497
A very high official...
I can't mention his name right now.

04:13.587 --> 04:17.079
Made me an offer
to sell his country's tax receivables

04:17.174 --> 04:18.755
to a third party for 80 cents on the dollar...

04:18.842 --> 04:21.504
Excuse me. l have to leave.
This is unacceptable, please.

04:22.012 --> 04:26.802
Bill. Bill, no, lwouldn't be doing this
if I didn't think it was worth Jo's time.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.844
Don't trust me, trust Philip.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.852
Good things come in surprising ways.
You never know.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.224
You never know, right?

04:33.315 --> 04:36.978
I mean, what, worse comes to worse,
he kicks me out the door.

04:37.069 --> 04:39.060
No! Worse comes to worse,
he kicks me out the door.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.611
It is myjob to keep people like you away.
Don't you get that?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.984
-Yes.
-80 please, respect my position.

04:44.368 --> 04:45.357
Stop.

04:46.870 --> 04:47.859
Please.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.954
I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.255
So I'll tell my partners
that we had a good conversation.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.132
And we'll see what happens. Okay?

05:06.556 --> 05:07.545
Thank you, Bill.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.187
NORMAN: It’s not just about this one deal.

05:24.282 --> 05:27.900
It’s about connecting to people
at the level of Wi/f or Taub.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.156
PHILIP: If only it were that easy.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.197
NORMAN: Look,
I’m meeting a very high lsraeli ofﬁcial

05:33.291 --> 05:34.747
at a conference later today.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.745
All / need is to get my lsrae/i
in a room with one of these guys.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.339
PHlLlP: / don’t know if he would get involved
in a political situation.

05:42.426 --> 05:44.542
NORMAN: Trust me,
something good will happen.

CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY)

06:11.413 --> 06:14.905
RON: ...of chemical warfare
on a first name basis.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.663
Some of them are married to Russian women.

06:19.838 --> 06:23.797
But it should be a real contact
without a drop of arrogance.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.170
MODERATOR: Well, suppose someone says
you can't trust them.

06:26.261 --> 06:30.971
You would say it is not a matter of trust
but one of national interest?

06:31.725 --> 06:32.965
RON: There is clearly a problem.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.597
Is America pushing Russia

06:36.688 --> 06:40.852
away from the West
and into the arms of China?

06:41.526 --> 06:44.142
Some natural gas experts
in this room will say

06:44.946 --> 06:46.482
that's exactly what they are doing

06:47.324 --> 06:50.361
by encouraging a pipeline
between Israel and Turkey.

06:51.286 --> 06:55.450
But as I always say,
when dealing with global interests,

06:56.041 --> 06:59.249
we shouldn't be playing backgammon,

06:59.336 --> 07:00.542
-Shesh Besh, you know.
-(MAN COUGHS)

07:01.713 --> 07:05.376
Where you roll your dice
and hope for the best.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.881
We should be playing chess.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.541
The distinguished minister

07:39.126 --> 07:41.458
for whom I have a great deal of respect,

07:42.212 --> 07:46.546
seems to know a lot about everything,
and it is hard to argue with him.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.958
China, Russia, America...

07:50.137 --> 07:52.628
-(AUDIENCE CHUCKLES)
-He must know what he is talking about.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.426
He's my boss, after all.

07:57.394 --> 07:58.725
And a very good chess player.

08:00.397 --> 08:04.231
But, you know,
um, George Bernard Shaw once said,

08:05.735 --> 08:09.899
"Some people see the way things are
and ask, 'Why?'

08:11.074 --> 08:15.067
"I see how things should be

-Bye.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.176
(INAUDIBLE)

10:45.979 --> 10:47.389
...people were there today.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.516
You know, I'd be happy
to introduce you to him.

10:50.317 --> 10:52.478
Shall I tell him that you are in town?
I could do that.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.982
You know, I'm going to a dinner
at his house tonight. You can join me.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.395
How do you know Arthur Taub?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.114
Oh, my wife used to babysit him.

11:00.201 --> 11:01.987
And then she ended up working for him,
years later.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.113
They were very close. Very close.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.991
Why don't I just call Arthur right now
because I'm sure he would be happy...

11:06.082 --> 11:09.165
-Hold on, please, put the phone back.
-Happy to have his...

11:09.753 --> 11:12.995
Welcome to Lanvin.
How can I help you today?

11:13.381 --> 11:18.501
Mr. Eshel is speaking in a series of meetings
with businessmen and diplomats.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.836
He is interested in trying out those shoes
in the window.

11:20.930 --> 11:24.514
Sure, may I ask
what line of business you're in?

11:24.601 --> 11:27.889
Well, I don't want to ruin my first impression,
but I'm a politician.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.685
NORMAN: Well, not any politician.

11:29.773 --> 11:34.142
Mr. Micha Eshel is
the Minister of Trade and Labor in Israel,

11:34.235 --> 11:35.645
and Deputy to the Prime Minister.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.820
No,no,no.
I'm the Deputy Minister of Trade and Labor.

11:39.324 --> 11:43.408
My boss, the Minister,
is Deputy to the Prime Minister.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.658
But there are three other deputies,
just to put things in context.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.579
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.284
I'm sorry, but you look too young
to be so important.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.870
Well, thank you for the very flattering lie.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.374
He has a future in politics.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.832
Which is more than I can say for myself.

11:58.927 --> 12:01.589
I might be young, but I'm already washed-up.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.965
-You don't look washed-up.
-Yeah.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.464
That's because I'm in New York now.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.601
New York makes me feel good.
Back home, I look tired.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.723
NORMAN: No. No, you don't.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.522
I've seen your appearances on TV.
You look great.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.734
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, well, that's because
I'm very photogenic.

12:17.821 --> 12:22.485
No, no. It's because
you are one of the few Israeli politicians

12:22.575 --> 12:23.826
who radiates optimism.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.571
Optimism... Yeah.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.621
Well, the shoes I buy today will last longer
than the government I serve in.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.663
Change is good. That's what they tell me.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.083
The fashion world relies on change.

12:34.170 --> 12:38.288
And the Middle East relies on...
How do you say stagnatzia?

12:38.383 --> 12:40.123
-Stagnation.
-Stagnation, yeah.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.259
Once you're in power,
you don't want anything to change.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.177
You can ask my boss about this.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.381
SALESMAN: The young Minister
shouldn't feel washed-up.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.932
Excuse me for saying, please.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.104
I can help with this.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.355
Let me try something.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.605
So, you said your wife works
for Arthur Taub?

13:04.534 --> 13:07.025
NORMAN: She used to, yes.
She passed away.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.198
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:09.497 --> 13:10.577
It was years ago.

13:10.665 --> 13:13.247
But she was very close to Arthur.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.747
And lwould be beyond happy
if you were to join me tonight.

13:16.838 --> 13:18.169
He is someone you should meet.

13:18.882 --> 13:22.090
Yeah, I know. I've been hearing his name
from a few different people recently.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.542
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.551
What's he like?

13:26.473 --> 13:28.009
There are two kinds of moguls.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.717
First kind is like a big ocean liner ship.

13:32.353 --> 13:37.017
Makes a lot of waves, a lot of noise,
everybody sees it coming from miles away.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.477
Like Jo Wilf.

13:40.236 --> 13:43.148
I think your boss, Minister Maor, is actually...

13:43.239 --> 13:46.151
-In his close circle of friends, of course.
-Yeah. Mmm.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.859
And then, there is Arthur.

13:50.205 --> 13:52.662
Well, Arthur is more
like a nuclear submarine.

13:52.749 --> 13:57.083
He's quiet. He's fast. He's young.

13:57.587 --> 13:59.498
-Extremely sophisticated.
-Mmm.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.335
-lnteresting.
-Yeah, he's a very interesting fellow.

14:03.426 --> 14:06.543
He likes to surround himself
with consultants

14:06.638 --> 14:10.426
who are in influential
political positions, you know.

14:10.517 --> 14:15.682
And he's very good at compensating
his consultants. He's...

14:16.272 --> 14:18.934
Yeah, well, maybe I'll have
my office contact him.

14:19.734 --> 14:24.228
We'll see. I'm not a private person, you know.
Not yet, anyway. So...

14:25.490 --> 14:31.156
Yeah, if you have any trouble reaching him,
please, I'd be happy to help you.

14:31.663 --> 14:33.995
Thank you. Thank you very much.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.993
So where are you staying while you are here?
How can I reach you?

14:37.085 --> 14:39.121
Just a second. Can I look at myself yet?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.292
SALESMAN: Please do.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.229
Well, take this away from me
before I get used to it.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.822
There is one rule
every Israeli politician learns

15:09.909 --> 15:11.524
in the beginning of his career.

15:11.619 --> 15:15.203
You cannot wear a suit that costs
more than an ordinary man's car.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.655
But what if you didn't know what it costs?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.159
I do. It's too late.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.538
Israelis don't like to see
their representatives enjoying themselves.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.789
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.331
-At least take the shoes.
-No, enough. I don't want them.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.339
Let me buy you the shoes.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.764
It would be my privilege
to buy you these shoes.

15:34.851 --> 15:38.435
-ESHEL: Please...
-If it makes an Israeli leader feel good,

15:38.521 --> 15:39.761
it's the least that I can do.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.016
Just put them on one more time.
Would you do that?

15:47.196 --> 15:48.185
Put your feet in.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.862
Before you say no, just...

15:53.369 --> 15:54.779
(SIGHS)

15:55.121 --> 15:56.110
Please.

16:02.920 --> 16:05.002
-We'll take them.
-SALESMAN: Uh-huh.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.580
I don't want you
walking out of here empty-handed.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.636

that Israel is withholding.

I don't know.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.225

it is very important that you speak to me
or with Hanna first.

but he has good instincts,

-believe me, like his mother.
-His grades are good.

43:03.414 --> 43:06.406
But he missed some of his exams
because he had to go to miluim.

It's an Army service.

-What can we do?

-We live in a tough neighborhood.
-To understand

-what they are looking for...
-But he's an excellent student.

uh, connections now.

Okay. So what do you need?

48:05.424 --> 48:06.925
-What do I need?
-Yeah.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.419

necessarily things you can help me with.

-Oh.

49:19.415 --> 49:22.077
I noticed you were speaking
with the Prime Minister.

You know him well?

49:25.713 --> 49:28.500
Yes. Yes. I do.

50:03.084 --> 50:07.327
but the best investment I made my whole life.

50:14.387 --> 50:17.220
May I ask what you do for a living?

50:17.306 --> 50:19.262
Sure. I'm a businessman.

50:19.350 --> 50:22.092
Oh. What sort of business?

50:23.396 --> 50:26.229
Um, consulting. Mostly.

50:29.151 --> 50:30.937
Who do you consult?

50:31.278 --> 50:36.147
Well, businesses, organizations, individuals.
It varies, you know.

50:37.868 --> 50:40.530
Sometimes I consult other consultants.

50:44.291 --> 50:47.328
But do you have a specific area of expertise?

50:47.962 --> 50:50.874
Can you explain to me
how your business works?

50:50.965 --> 50:53.798
If it is not too complicated. I'm curious.

I'm still at Penn Station.

Are you on the street?

53:17.403 --> 53:19.268
No. I'm still inside.

53:23.951 --> 53:27.443
I just realized
you didn't have my telephone number.

Bruce Schwartz.
Special Middle East Coordinator.

54:22.343 --> 54:23.799
It's good to finally meet in person,
Prime Minister.

54:23.886 --> 54:24.921
We don't have to shake hands.

54:25.012 --> 54:26.377
You're not going to make me
put on my shoes, are you?

54:26.472 --> 54:29.430
No. No. No. This is as informal as could be.

54:29.516 --> 54:32.007
Good. The formal me needs a rest.

54:32.102 --> 54:33.478
Bruce would like to go over some points

54:33.562 --> 54:35.769
before tomorrow's meeting
with the President.

54:35.856 --> 54:37.972
Well, it's less about
your meeting with the President

54:38.067 --> 54:40.023
and more about the statements
you will be delivering

54:40.110 --> 54:41.145
elsewhere around town.

54:41.236 --> 54:43.978
Now, as someone who occupies
a fairly tough job himself...

54:44.073 --> 54:45.529
ESHEL: Excuse me, let me stop you. Please.

54:45.616 --> 54:48.232
Tell the President that
I am here to say "yes" to peace.

54:48.327 --> 54:50.693
I'm sorry "state of peace",
as we agreed to call it.

54:50.788 --> 54:54.246
I fully accept his vision.
I understand it and I believe in it.

54:54.333 --> 54:57.951
No internal politics will change
my commitment to the Wye document.

54:58.212 --> 55:00.373
This evening I had to, uh...

55:01.507 --> 55:03.247
How do you say, uh, mas sefataim?

55:03.550 --> 55:05.677
-To pay lip service.
-Yeah, I had to pay lip service

55:05.761 --> 55:10.721
to a few organizations on a few minor issues,
but I promise you, it has no substance.

BRUCE: Well, I'm sure the President
will be very...

55:12.977 --> 55:15.093
You know what I've found out
in the last couple of weeks

55:15.187 --> 55:16.393
since I was elected?

55:16.480 --> 55:19.688
-Maybe the President can identify with me.
-(CHUCKLING)

55:19.775 --> 55:22.141
For the first time,
I don't have political worries.

55:22.236 --> 55:26.980
Somehow, God put me in this job.

55:27.074 --> 55:29.656
It's not that I didn't work very hard
to get here, I did,

55:29.743 --> 55:33.952
but hundreds of other potential leaders
worked and campaigned just as hard as I did,

55:34.039 --> 55:37.531
and for some reason,
I'm the one sitting in this chair today.

55:37.626 --> 55:41.210
The top spot.
I've reached the top of the ladder.

55:41.714 --> 55:43.545
Why me and not someone else? (SCOFFS)

55:43.632 --> 55:46.624
Who knows?
Believe me, I'm as surprised as anyone else.

55:46.719 --> 55:48.459
But this is the interesting thing,

55:48.554 --> 55:52.297
instead of feeling the burden
of that great responsibility,

55:52.850 --> 55:54.636
I'm feeling...

55:56.020 --> 55:57.009
How do you say goral?

55:57.479 --> 55:59.470
-Fate.
-Fate. I feel fate.

56:00.232 --> 56:03.895
If God put me here,
he must have had a good reason.

56:04.445 --> 56:06.606
Now, I'm not free to run away from this job,

56:06.697 --> 56:09.109
but to be honest,
no single human being can really claim

56:09.199 --> 56:10.814
to be big enough for this job either.

56:10.909 --> 56:13.036
I would be very happy
to go over our itinerary...

56:13.120 --> 56:15.486
What is it that really worries the President?
Tell me.

56:16.457 --> 56:18.448
What doesn't he want me to say?

56:19.084 --> 56:22.076
Well, you have been saying
different things in different forums.

56:22.171 --> 56:24.378
And I think we're just trying
to get a better understanding

56:24.465 --> 56:27.502
of what is the singular message
you wish to deliver.

56:28.594 --> 56:30.459
Oh, the "singular message"?

56:31.597 --> 56:33.133

56:35.476 --> 56:39.389
Hanna? Hanna, how many
completely opposing organization leaders

56:39.480 --> 56:41.641
came up to me and said, "We're behind you"?

56:42.441 --> 56:44.056
Fifty? 100?

56:44.151 --> 56:47.063
Each with a completely different agenda.

56:47.488 --> 56:50.605
There is no such thing
as a singular message.

56:50.699 --> 56:52.940
And anyone who tells you
he's got a singular message

56:53.035 --> 56:55.947
is probably teaching at a university
or writing a blog.

56:56.038 --> 56:59.656
-Okay, I didn't mean it that way, I'm sorry...
-I'Il tell you what my singular message is.

56:59.750 --> 57:01.741
I'm going to end this conflict.

57:01.835 --> 57:04.668
How? I'm going to say "yes" to compromise.

57:04.755 --> 57:06.620
To everybody!

57:08.050 --> 57:10.587
Because the opposite of compromise
is not idealism.

57:10.677 --> 57:13.805
The opposite of compromise is not integrity.

57:14.098 --> 57:18.432
The opposite of compromise
is fanaticism and death.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.306
Life is compromise.

57:22.397 --> 57:24.683
I not only believe in that, that is who I am.

57:24.775 --> 57:27.482
That is why I'm here, in this position.

(SIGHS)

57:30.864 --> 57:33.480
If it works,

57:33.575 --> 57:37.818
Iwill go down in history
as the leader who ended this epic conflict.

57:39.081 --> 57:43.996
If I'm wrong, and my compromise
leads to another catastrophic bloody war,

57:45.671 --> 57:50.335
I will blame God for giving me a role
I was clearly incapable of performing.

1:01:31.396 --> 1:01:34.229
Let's just say, get ready for a big surprise.

1:01:34.316 --> 1:01:36.523
How many zeros
are at the end of this surprise?

1:01:36.610 --> 1:01:38.100
-Can you tell me that at least?
-Come on.

1:01:38.236 --> 1:01:41.194
A considerable surprise. That's it.

1:01:41.281 --> 1:01:42.316
I gotta go, Rabbi.

1:01:42.407 --> 1:01:44.784
No, no, Norman, you realize
how important this is, right?

1:01:44.868 --> 1:01:46.199
We are going to get kicked out of here.

1:01:46.286 --> 1:01:48.618
You need to give us a firm answer.
No games, Norman.

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:49.990
-Hold on. Hold...
-No time for...

1:01:50.082 --> 1:01:51.162
I can’t hear a word you’re saying.

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:52.705

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.621
God damn it!

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.668
How is the rabbi
connected to this again, Norman?

1:01:57.881 --> 1:01:59.496
Remind me. Why am I doing this?

1:01:59.591 --> 1:02:02.207
Do you want Rabbi Blumenthal
to marry you or not?

1:02:02.302 --> 1:02:05.214
All you have to do is you pick up the phone,

1:02:05.305 --> 1:02:09.048
call one of your buddies at Harvard
on behalf of the Prime Minister of Israel.

1:02:09.142 --> 1:02:11.007
Is that really so difficult for you?

1:02:11.103 --> 1:02:14.846
Don't belittle what I'm doing, okay?
In the world of Harvard admissions,

1:02:14.940 --> 1:02:18.432
this is the biggest no-no in the book.
It's like incest. It's taboo.

1:02:18.527 --> 1:02:22.111
That's funny, because Rabbi Blumenthal
is going to think exactly the same thing

1:02:22.197 --> 1:02:25.485
when he finds out I'm asking him
to marry a Cohen and a convert,

1:02:25.575 --> 1:02:28.157
who hasn't even officially converted.

1:02:28.495 --> 1:02:29.530

1:02:30.038 --> 1:02:32.950
Jo, something very, very big is going on.

1:02:33.041 --> 1:02:34.542
I can't be more specific than that,

1:02:34.626 --> 1:02:35.957
but if you saw the papers this morning,

1:02:36.044 --> 1:02:37.705
you're gonna have some idea
what I'm talking about...

1:02:37.796 --> 1:02:40.287
I'm not following you, Norman.
Did you speak to him or not?

1:02:40.382 --> 1:02:43.920
No, but I’m going to read
the latest message I got from Hanna.

1:02:44.010 --> 1:02:45.090

that I'm going to be able to get to them.

is just outside that closed door.

-She's gonna help us...
-Norman, cut the bullshit!

then call me back when he says yes to you!

Until then don't waste my time!

1:03:18.462 --> 1:03:20.123
Yeah, Jo, but this is time-sensitive.

1:03:20.213 --> 1:03:22.955
Look, I've got to tell Rabbi Blumenthal
that you're gonna give the money

1:03:23.049 --> 1:03:24.459
because someone else
is gonna buy that building...

1:03:24.551 --> 1:03:28.169
Rabbi Blumenthal is not my fucking problem!

1:03:28.263 --> 1:03:31.426
They're going to launch a war in Syria
that's gonna turn into World War III!

I don't give a shit who started World War III.

1:03:33.852 --> 1:03:35.558
He's got a country to run. He's busy!

He can afford it. He knows me.

the history of the building, everything.

on remaining anonymous?

there would be hundreds of other requests.

come by and say hello.

1:25:22.785 --> 1:25:24.992
He'd be...
Oi, he would be delighted to see you.

1:25:26.538 --> 1:25:30.030
Are you all right?
You look a little shaken up. Huh?

1:25:30.751 --> 1:25:33.367
How can I help you? Let me help you.
What do you need?

1:25:33.462 --> 1:25:34.668
Tell me what you need.

1:25:36.048 --> 1:25:37.663
-What do I need?
-Yes, please.

1:25:37.758 --> 1:25:41.125
Could you give me the honor of helping you?
You're a choshuve’ man.

1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:42.881
Please, a very important guy.

1:25:42.971 --> 1:25:45.007
Which... We're going to walk together.
Which way... Are you okay?

1:25:45.098 --> 1:25:46.383
-I...
-WhiCh way are you going?

1:25:47.559 --> 1:25:50.596
-The Israeli consulate on Second Ave.
-I'm going that way. Come on.

1:25:51.772 --> 1:25:53.933
-What, you just get bad news?
-Yeah, I ate something.

1:25:54.024 --> 1:25:55.980
-You ate something?
-I have to have a Benadryl.

1:25:56.068 --> 1:25:57.774
Sometimes, I get a little thing in my body...

1:25:57.861 --> 1:25:59.726
You get allergies?

1:25:59.822 --> 1:26:02.404
You know who it is, this...
The New York businessman?

1:26:02.491 --> 1:26:03.651
If I knew, would I tell you?

1:26:03.742 --> 1:26:07.234
Well, no. 'Cause I heard a rumor but,
you know, they swore me to secrecy.

1:26:07.329 --> 1:26:09.035
Yeah, yeah, don't believe the rumors.

1:26:09.122 --> 1:26:10.987
Well look,
obviously you know more than I do,

1:26:11.083 --> 1:26:13.495
but whoever this guy is,
one thing is for certain,

1:26:13.585 --> 1:26:15.667
it's a conspiracy. Yeah?

1:26:15.754 --> 1:26:19.246
They found a way to assassinate Eshel,
without actually killing him.

1:26:19.341 --> 1:26:22.333
Don't bury Eshel yet. Trust me.
He's not going anywhere.

1:26:22.427 --> 1:26:24.509
Why? What do you know?

1:26:24.596 --> 1:26:25.676
You know something.

1:26:25.764 --> 1:26:28.050
Eh, I can't go into details,

1:26:28.141 --> 1:26:32.009
but let's just say
that this unnamed businessman...

1:26:32.104 --> 1:26:33.435
(SCOFFS)

1:26:33.897 --> 1:26:35.512
He's a nobody. He's a parasite.

1:26:35.607 --> 1:26:38.144
He's trying to
extort money from the Prime Minister.

1:26:38.235 --> 1:26:40.601
He is the lowest of the low, this guy.

1:26:40.696 --> 1:26:44.439
He made up a story, you know.
The whole thing is just a made-up thing.

1:26:44.533 --> 1:26:46.239
You know? It's... It's...

1:26:46.326 --> 1:26:48.032
Eshel doesn't even know the man.

1:27:02.426 --> 1:27:04.257
I think I'm okay from here on.

1:27:04.344 --> 1:27:06.551
So, thank you. I... I appreciate it.

1:27:06.638 --> 1:27:09.050
Are you sure?
Because I'm happy to go in with you.

1:27:10.350 --> 1:27:11.726
No. I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:27:11.810 --> 1:27:13.471
You want I should wait out here?

1:27:15.314 --> 1:27:18.181
No, I... I'm good from here, I...

1:27:18.984 --> 1:27:21.600
But, thank you very much, I really...
I appreciate it.

1:27:21.695 --> 1:27:24.311
Norman, are you going to do me a favor?

1:27:24.406 --> 1:27:27.148
You're gonna call me
if you need anything at all.

1:27:27.242 --> 1:27:29.654
You don't understand,
it's going to be my pleasure to help you.

I... lforgot something. I...

1:29:01.586 --> 1:29:03.918
I'm gonna be canceling this meeting, so...

1:29:05.590 --> 1:29:08.332
Look, I don't see my phone in there.
Can you give me my phone?

1:29:10.137 --> 1:29:12.128
Can you give me my phone? Hello?

1:29:13.432 --> 1:29:14.512
Hello?

1:29:15.100 --> 1:29:17.341

-I don't see my phone!

1:29:21.106 --> 1:29:24.269
So you might as well
give me my phone back right now, please!

ALEX: It’s okay. Come.

1:29:49.176 --> 1:29:52.509

They told me not to meet with you.

1:29:58.101 --> 1:29:59.090
ALEX: Who?

1:30:00.812 --> 1:30:02.803
NORMAN: The Prime Minister’s ofﬁce. Duby.

1:30:04.608 --> 1:30:07.816
I don ’t want to upset them.
He’ll know I was here. I don’t...

1:30:07.903 --> 1:30:09.439
It was a mistake.

1:30:10.530 --> 1:30:13.237
No, please. Irespect you very much.
I’m sorry. I apologize.

1:30:13.325 --> 1:30:14.610
I shouldn ’t have called you.

1:30:14.701 --> 1:30:17.989
ALEX: No. It’s good that you called.
I’m glad you’re here.

1:30:20.165 --> 1:30:24.659
Norman, I want this conversation
to be as straightfon/vard

1:30:24.753 --> 1:30:27.790
and honest as possible.
Do you think you can do that?

1:30:30.175 --> 1:30:32.257
I spent the past few months

1:30:32.344 --> 1:30:35.381
trying to know more about you.

1:30:37.182 --> 1:30:39.924
Where you come from, what you do,

1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:42.516
who your friends are, your family.

1:30:43.355 --> 1:30:45.516
Your ﬁnancial situation.

1:30:46.149 --> 1:30:49.357
And what I’ve discovered is very strange.

1:30:50.028 --> 1:30:52.770
Everybody seems to know who you are.

1:30:53.573 --> 1:30:56.155
But nobody knows anything about you.

1:30:56.243 --> 1:30:59.076
Even people
who say they have known you for years.

1:30:59.996 --> 1:31:03.955
For instance, nobody knows where you live.

1:31:04.042 --> 1:31:07.580
I was able to confirm that
you inherited a small amount of money

1:31:07.671 --> 1:31:09.127
from your mother,

1:31:09.214 --> 1:31:13.799
and that she left you
her rent-controlled apartment after she died.

1:31:13.885 --> 1:31:18.003
But I wasn’t able to
verify that you have a daughter

1:31:18.098 --> 1:31:20.214
or that you were ever married.

1:31:21.560 --> 1:31:22.595
Were you?

1:31:23.562 --> 1:31:25.018
Do you have a daughter?

1:31:26.606 --> 1:31:28.892
NORMAN: Why are you
gathering this information about me?

1:31:30.026 --> 1:31:32.108
ALEX: Because you’ve been
unusually generous

1:31:32.195 --> 1:31:34.607
toward the Prime Minister of Israel

1:31:34.698 --> 1:31:38.282
and have created
an intricate network of people

1:31:38.368 --> 1:31:40.905
who beneﬁt from the access you provide.

1:31:43.707 --> 1:31:47.950
The relationship you've established
with the Prime Minister of Israel

1:31:48.044 --> 1:31:49.705
is illegal.

1:31:50.589 --> 1:31:52.580
I think it is corrupt.

1:32:20.869 --> 1:32:22.734
You are that man, Norman.

1:32:24.789 --> 1:32:26.450
You are our witness.

1:32:27.334 --> 1:32:28.870
(SCOFFS) No, I'm not.

1:32:28.960 --> 1:32:32.327
We can subpoena you. You have no Choice.

1:32:33.590 --> 1:32:35.797

1:32:35.884 --> 1:32:39.001
Wait. You need to hear what I have to say.

1:32:40.138 --> 1:32:43.847
We're arranging
for an early deposition for you tomorrow.

1:32:44.768 --> 1:32:47.760
I can't force you to stay here now.

If you testify and speak truthfully
about everything that you've experienced,

1:33:13.672 --> 1:33:16.163
we can protect you from self-incrimination.

1:33:16.883 --> 1:33:19.625
It will be about him. Not about you.

1:33:27.018 --> 1:33:29.270
But what is Eshel going to do?

1:33:29.354 --> 1:33:31.219
What will he do to me?

1:33:34.484 --> 1:33:38.898
They will try to
persuade the court and the public

1:33:38.989 --> 1:33:42.197
that you are an unreliable witness.

1:33:43.743 --> 1:33:46.325
That will most likely be their defense.

as an innocent victim.

Nobody wants to see our peace efforts
go down the drain...

1:35:24.761 --> 1:35:27.468
...because of some shady Jewish macher.

1:35:27.764 --> 1:35:31.256

as a delusional name-dropper...

1:35:51.746 --> 1:35:53.156
lwon't hurt him.

1:35:53.706 --> 1:35:55.662
It is not personal.

It's bigger than
the pain felt by one individual.

Do you accept my apology, Norman?

1:42:02.533 --> 1:42:04.034
Do you forgive me?

1:42:15.171 --> 1:42:17.127
I will never betray you.

1:42:20.927 --> 1:42:22.417
I love you, Norman.

1:42:24.013 --> 1:42:25.378
Thank you.

1:43:17.275 --> 1:43:18.310
NORMAN: Good morning, Bill.

1:43:19.151 --> 1:43:20.140
Oh...

1:43:22.780 --> 1:43:23.940
Why do you do this?

1:43:25.116 --> 1:43:27.152
Why can't anything ever be simple with you?

1:43:27.243 --> 1:43:29.108
Who says simple is good?

1:43:29.662 --> 1:43:32.244
I have a business opportunity for Jo.
He's going to like this.

1:43:32.331 --> 1:43:35.368
No. No, you don't.
Whatever it is, it's too small.

1:43:45.011 --> 1:43:46.296
Norman.

1:43:46.971 --> 1:43:47.960
Wait.

1:43:50.266 --> 1:43:52.632
I'm listening out of respect to my father.

1:43:54.103 --> 1:43:55.809
You knew him, didn't you?

1:43:58.983 --> 1:44:00.769
All right. What have you got?

1:44:03.821 --> 1:44:07.939
If you knew with 100 percent certainty

1:44:08.034 --> 1:44:11.322
that the witness who is
trying to topple down Prime Minister Eshel

1:44:11.412 --> 1:44:13.152
will never testify,

1:44:14.540 --> 1:44:16.531
would you know
how to make money with that information?

1:44:19.378 --> 1:44:22.245
Well, it depends on
where and how I got that information

1:44:22.340 --> 1:44:23.500
and if I can verify it.

1:44:23.591 --> 1:44:25.673
You realize
you're not a very reliable source, right?

1:44:26.218 --> 1:44:28.800
You put me in a room with Jo Wilf.

1:44:28.888 --> 1:44:30.753
I'll give him all the certainty he needs.

1:44:33.351 --> 1:44:35.433
Think about it. Go ahead. Think about it.

1:44:36.354 --> 1:44:38.140
Run the numbers, do the whole thing.

1:44:39.190 --> 1:44:41.306
You have until 8:00 am. to call me back.

1:44:41.984 --> 1:44:44.851
-After that, I'm going to Arthur Taub.
-(EXHALES SHARPLY)

1:44:52.203 --> 1:44:53.534
What's your fee?

1:46:37.308 --> 1:46:38.297
(EXHALES)

1:46:38.392 --> 1:46:40.303
BLUMENTHAL: Philip. Nico/e.

1:46:40.644 --> 1:46:43.886
At times like this,
when we're aware of our blessings,

1:46:43.981 --> 1:46:46.814
we also know that the world
is in desperate need of repair.

1:46:47.651 --> 1:46:51.360
Tradition explains
the act of breaking the glass

1:46:51.447 --> 1:46:54.405
reminds us to turn our hearts
towards the City of Jerusalem.

1:46:54.492 --> 1:46:57.859
In which the ultimate peace
shall be granted to the world.

1:46:59.914 --> 1:47:01.120
-Mazel tov!
-(APPLAUSE)

1:47:27.066 --> 1:47:28.272
Thank you.

1:47:31.028 --> 1:47:33.189
Welcome to Harvard, David Eshel.

1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:34.986
Thank you. Happy to be here.

1:47:41.205 --> 1:47:42.741
REPORTER: As we turn to
the economic implications

1:47:42.832 --> 1:47:44.072
of this peace treaty this morning,

1:47:44.166 --> 1:47:47.033
one investor, Jo Wilf,
is looking like a big winner.

1:47:47.128 --> 1:47:50.461
And when I say big winner, I mean, like,
a-bi/Iion-dol/ars-overnight big winner.

1:47:50.548 --> 1:47:53.460
Wilf, at a series of what now
seem like pretty prescient bets that...

1:47:53.551 --> 1:47:55.212
All the way back to the conversation
we’ve been having

1:47:55.302 --> 1:47:58.169
about the possible impeachment
of Israel’s Prime Minister.

1:47:58.264 --> 1:48:01.427
Now, just when everyone thought
the Prime Minister would get the boot,

1:48:01.517 --> 1:48:03.303
Wilf bets the opposite.

1:48:03.394 --> 1:48:06.181
He shorts natural gas
and then he magically buys shares

1:48:06.272 --> 1:48:09.389
in both Sampton Energy
and the Tel Aviv-based Barkin Group.

1:48:09.483 --> 1:48:11.974
Those are the companies
building the Israel- Turkey pipeline.

1:48:12.069 --> 1:48:14.606
This deal is starting to look like
the trade of the decade.

1:48:15.573 --> 1:48:16.733
Genius.
