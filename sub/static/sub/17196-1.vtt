it look like an accident.

<i>hey, this is owen.</i>
<i>Leave me a message.</i>

27:29.682 --> 27:32.950
Owen, you had better
answer my calls.

27:32.952 --> 27:35.519
You do not speculate,
and I'd--

27:38.156 --> 27:40.557
You better
call me back.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.201
Hey, renee,
I got something for you.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.369
12-year-old kid
found dead

28:25.371 --> 28:26.737
At the beach
at gracepoint.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.338
It's a small town
halfway between here

28:28.340 --> 28:29.573
And the oregon border.

28:29.575 --> 28:31.108
Likely homicide.

28:34.412 --> 28:38.248
Send me the link.
It's yours.

here, sweetie.

29:02.575 --> 29:04.241
<i>Here you go.</i>

29:04.243 --> 29:06.777
We're taking
danny's computer.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.746
Will you tell us
if you find anything on it?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.281
(hugo)
that's really not up to me,
mrs. Solano.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.551
They released
his name.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.886
Did you agree to that?

29:15.888 --> 29:17.454
Wait, agree to what?

29:17.456 --> 29:19.423
It's online
from the <i>gracepoint journal.</i>

29:19.425 --> 29:21.225
Daniel solano.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.359
Everyone knows it's us now.

29:22.361 --> 29:23.560
Why did you do that?

29:23.562 --> 29:25.262
You need to talk
to detective carver.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.897
<i>No, we're talking</i>
<i>to you.</i>

29:26.899 --> 29:29.533
And how do you know
about it anyway?

29:29.535 --> 29:32.369
I got an alert
on gracepoint and death.

29:32.371 --> 29:33.804

chloe.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.272

or we wouldn't know.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.007

<i>know what?</i>

29:39.043 --> 29:41.612
Who told
that journalist?

29:41.614 --> 29:43.046
That family's lives
are destroyed,

29:43.048 --> 29:44.748
And then we screw up
and make it worse!

29:44.750 --> 29:47.251
Why the hell
should they trust us now?

29:47.253 --> 29:50.487
Who was it?

29:57.262 --> 29:59.363
There--
[clears throat]

30:01.399 --> 30:03.000
There was
an assumption made.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.601
Your nephew?

30:04.603 --> 30:06.770
He called me

30:06.772 --> 30:08.639
And he said
he saw danny's sister

30:08.641 --> 30:10.941
Leaving a toy of his
behind at the beach.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.744
I did not give
any confirmation.

30:13.746 --> 30:16.747
I told him
not to publish.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.949
I will talk to him.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.584
I will explain everything
to the family.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.187
Go away.

30:29.294 --> 30:30.460

(emmett)
at 6:52 a.M. Today,

30:48.314 --> 30:49.880
The body
of a 12-year-old child

30:49.882 --> 30:54.117
Was found on north beach
here in gracepoint.

30:54.119 --> 30:59.623
Deceased has been identified
as local resident daniel solano.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.024
The family
has been notified,

31:01.026 --> 31:03.560
And a homicide investigation
is now underway.

31:03.562 --> 31:06.129
A full media briefing
will follow this evening.

31:06.131 --> 31:08.031
We ask you to respect
the family's privacy

31:08.033 --> 31:09.867
At this difficult time.

31:09.869 --> 31:12.035
(woman)
do you have any suspects--
no questions now.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.036
Thank you.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.071
You know that guy?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.505
He was a detective
in rosemont

31:15.507 --> 31:17.641
When I was
on the paper there.

31:17.643 --> 31:21.478
I can't believe
he got hired again.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.680
Boss.

31:23.682 --> 31:25.315
Suspected homicide.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.484
Kid in a small town
couple of hours up the coast.

31:27.486 --> 31:28.719
Gender, age?

31:28.721 --> 31:30.554
Boy, 12.
I want to go up--

31:30.556 --> 31:32.856
Wrong gender, wrong age.
Too far, cost too much.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.825
Just take what the locals
report and polish.

31:34.827 --> 31:36.059
Come on,
all I'm doing right now

31:36.061 --> 31:37.361
Is polishing
press releases.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.762
And I've got an angle
on this story--

31:38.764 --> 31:40.197
I like your drive,
clemons.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.400
Let's not waste it
on this one, huh?

31:52.577 --> 31:54.244
Hey.

31:54.246 --> 31:57.047
Long day.
Right.

31:57.049 --> 31:59.549
It is so tragic.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.251
I can't image
what that family

32:01.253 --> 32:03.186
Must be going through
right now.

32:03.188 --> 32:06.423
<i>Everyone's in shock.</i>
<i>[sighs]</i>

32:06.425 --> 32:09.092
And do you think that the beach
will be closed tomorrow?

32:09.094 --> 32:12.562
I mean, just so I know
what to tell my guests.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.064
I don't know.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.532
Only I've had one room
check out early

32:15.534 --> 32:18.068
And an email cancellation
just tonight, so I--

32:18.070 --> 32:20.437
I'm going up.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.740
Oh, I forgot there are people
waiting for you

32:23.742 --> 32:25.776
In the bar.

32:30.148 --> 32:33.283
Speak.

32:33.285 --> 32:34.751
I'm an idiot.

32:34.753 --> 32:36.954
I shouldn't have posted
danny's name.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.455
I apologize.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.257
I've made it clear--
another move like that,

32:40.259 --> 32:42.659
He'll be singing at least
a whole octave higher.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.461
All reporting
comes through me now.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.964
The <i>journal</i> works
with the police.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.131
I'll talk
to mark and beth,

32:48.133 --> 32:49.566
Give them
our apologies.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.369
Stay out of my way.

33:03.681 --> 33:05.015
(ellie)
hey.

33:05.017 --> 33:07.084
(joe)
there she is.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.485
Mommy.
I told you she would come.

33:08.487 --> 33:12.456
Hey, there you are.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.325
And you're
eating spaghetti...

33:15.327 --> 33:17.861
And you're
wearing it too.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.796
Good job.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.765
[kissing]

33:21.767 --> 33:24.001
You okay?

33:24.003 --> 33:27.471
Hanging in there?

33:27.473 --> 33:31.141
I just--I actually
have to go back.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.175
I just came home
to shower

33:32.177 --> 33:35.846
And just kiss
these boys.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.415
Where's tom?
Upstairs.

33:39.350 --> 33:42.219
Okay.

33:42.221 --> 33:45.188
He doesn't know,
does he?

33:45.190 --> 33:47.124
Not yet.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.825
I kept him away
from it all.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.794
Okay.

33:50.796 --> 33:53.130
You know what happened?

33:53.132 --> 33:56.299
Should we be worried
for the kids?

33:56.301 --> 33:58.835
I don't know.

33:58.837 --> 34:01.538
I--

34:01.540 --> 34:02.839
[sighs]

34:02.841 --> 34:05.375
I should go talk
to tom.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.445
[sighing]

34:09.680 --> 34:11.882
Sorry about the job.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.150
Who cares?

34:13.152 --> 34:15.252
How's the new boss?
He okay?

34:15.254 --> 34:17.521
[cries]

34:17.523 --> 34:20.223
Hey, come here.

34:23.261 --> 34:25.562
It's all right.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.330
It's all right.

34:27.332 --> 34:32.436
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

34:47.452 --> 34:50.187
(mark)
I keep thinking that--

34:50.189 --> 34:51.955
That he's gonna
walk back in.

34:51.957 --> 34:54.057
Every time
I hear the phone ring,

34:54.059 --> 34:56.693
I think...

34:58.362 --> 35:01.198
I think--
I think it's danny.

35:04.068 --> 35:06.970
Why didn't you check
on him last night?

35:06.972 --> 35:08.738
<i>Hey, beth--</i>
<i>you always check</i>
<i>on him</i>

35:08.740 --> 35:09.906
When you come to bed.

35:09.908 --> 35:11.475
Why didn't you see
he was gone?

35:11.477 --> 35:13.677
Why didn't you?

35:16.481 --> 35:19.916
Where were you
last night?

35:19.918 --> 35:23.687
I told you.
I was working.

35:30.995 --> 35:35.132
(ellie)
you know danny
wasn't at school today, right?

35:35.134 --> 35:37.367
Yeah.

35:39.237 --> 35:42.172
Danny died last night.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.312
How?

35:49.314 --> 35:53.083
We're not sure.

35:53.085 --> 35:56.620
He was found
lying on the beach

35:56.622 --> 35:58.688
Early this morning.

36:00.625 --> 36:03.860
Does his mom
and dad know?

36:03.862 --> 36:07.164
Yeah, they do.

36:09.834 --> 36:16.773
Listen, when something
like this happens,

36:16.775 --> 36:19.142
It's--

36:19.144 --> 36:21.178
It's impossible
to know what to do

36:21.180 --> 36:24.181
Or how to feel,

36:24.183 --> 36:26.483
Especially when
it's your best friend,

36:26.485 --> 36:28.852
So you can be sad.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.354
<i>You can be</i>
<i>really angry.</i>

36:31.356 --> 36:33.623
<i>You can be confused.</i>

36:33.625 --> 36:36.693
<i>It's okay to cry.</i>

36:36.695 --> 36:40.197
You can do whatever
you need to do, okay?

36:42.333 --> 36:45.402
Will the police
need to--

36:45.404 --> 36:47.504
Will the police
want to talk to me?

36:47.506 --> 36:51.041
They probably will,
but I-I don't--

36:51.043 --> 36:56.580
I don't want you to think
about that right now, okay?

37:10.494 --> 37:13.230
Can I be alone now?

37:13.232 --> 37:15.232
Of course.

Of course.

38:45.023 --> 38:49.759
Sure you want
to be here?

38:49.761 --> 38:53.697
I used to drive
down here with him

38:53.699 --> 38:58.368
When he was little,
a year maybe.

38:58.370 --> 39:03.006
Middle of the day,
just me and him.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.675
I'd dip him
in the waves

39:05.677 --> 39:07.143
And sweep him up.

39:07.145 --> 39:09.713
[laughs]

39:09.715 --> 39:11.948
Tiny, fat legs
all wet.

39:11.950 --> 39:13.383
He loved it so much.

39:13.385 --> 39:16.686
He would just squeal

39:16.688 --> 39:20.256
With excitement.

39:22.059 --> 39:26.229
I used to do
the same thing with tom.

39:27.965 --> 39:30.066
Does tom know?

39:32.470 --> 39:38.208
Promise me, ellie,
because I don't know your boss.

39:38.210 --> 39:40.744
You and me, we go back.
The boys go back.

39:40.746 --> 39:46.449
I'm relying on you
to catch them.

39:48.052 --> 39:51.421
I promise you, beth.

39:51.423 --> 39:53.390
I promise.

39:56.060 --> 39:59.996
He did know, didn't he,
that I love him?

39:59.998 --> 40:02.665
Of course
he did.

40:02.667 --> 40:04.267
You are
a beautiful mother.

40:04.269 --> 40:07.837
You can't doubt that.

I feel so far away
from myself.

You saw that,
did you?

40:42.307 --> 40:44.474
Listen, I was hoping
for a hotel recommendation

40:44.476 --> 40:45.809
In gracepoint.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.210
You expect me
to help out a reporter

40:47.212 --> 40:49.078
From a rival newspaper?

40:49.080 --> 40:50.613
I'll assume

one of his toys there.

Look at this, security camera
from ichabod's last night.

42:01.019 --> 42:03.152
I called every business
on main street

42:03.154 --> 42:06.022
To see if they had
a security camera running.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.490
<i>(emmett)</i>
<i>is that danny?</i>

42:07.492 --> 42:09.659
Matches his clothes,
height.

42:09.661 --> 42:12.695
Even looks like
his skateboard.

42:12.697 --> 42:16.032
Danny wasn't abducted.
He snuck out.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.734
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Where was he going?</i>

42:17.736 --> 42:19.002
<i>Who was he meeting?</i>

42:19.004 --> 42:21.004
And where's his skateboard?

42:21.006 --> 42:24.207
Oh, and I also
went through a list

42:24.209 --> 42:26.543
Of his possessions.

42:26.545 --> 42:28.678
No cell phone,

42:28.680 --> 42:30.346
And I know he had one.

42:30.348 --> 42:32.515
He and my son tom, they texted
each other constantly.

42:32.517 --> 42:33.983
But it's not there?

42:33.985 --> 42:35.685
Nope, not from his body
or from his home.

42:35.687 --> 42:37.887
Check with the family.

42:39.657 --> 42:42.125
Nice, miller.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.696
(chief morgan)
thank you for coming.

42:46.698 --> 42:48.765
Let me hand this over
to detective carver,

42:48.767 --> 42:51.100
Who can answer
any specific questions.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.702
Kathy.

42:52.704 --> 42:54.504
What advice do you have
for people in the town,

42:54.506 --> 42:56.205
Particularly parents?

42:56.207 --> 42:59.909
The crime rate here is one
of the lowest in the state.

42:59.911 --> 43:05.214
This is a terrible,
uncharacteristic crime.

43:05.216 --> 43:07.383
Um...

43:07.385 --> 43:09.052
We're in the early moments

43:09.054 --> 43:12.622
Of what may be
a complex investigation.

43:12.624 --> 43:15.525
Danny's life touched
many people.

43:15.527 --> 43:17.927
<i>We'll be looking</i>
<i>at all those connections.</i>

43:17.929 --> 43:22.532
If you or someone you know
has any information,

43:22.534 --> 43:27.303
Has noticed anything unusual,
please come forward now.

43:27.305 --> 43:30.273
I'd urge everyone:
Don't hide anything,

43:30.275 --> 43:32.709
Because we will find out.

43:32.711 --> 43:36.546
If a member of your family
or a friend or a neighbor

43:36.548 --> 43:40.316
Has been behaving differently
in the past days or weeks,

43:40.318 --> 43:45.088
Please tell the police
immediately.

43:45.090 --> 43:49.425
There will be no hiding place
for danny's killer.

43:49.427 --> 43:52.829
We will catch
whoever did this.

43:52.831 --> 43:54.397
