00:10.802 --> 00:12.804
[girls screaming]

00:12.887 --> 00:14.889
[launcher explodes]

00:19.936 --> 00:21.604
[Peter]
The Turd Burglar is an online entity

00:21.688 --> 00:25.233
that has been terrorizing St. Bernardine
High School for quite some time,

00:25.316 --> 00:27.068
with a series of crimes.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.319
[Sam] They're poop crimes.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.863
Okay, how...

00:30.196 --> 00:32.782
How is he using my private photos?

00:33.324 --> 00:36.286
[Peter sighs] He or she
must have had access to your phone.

00:36.369 --> 00:39.497
We actually know
from one of his victims that...

00:40.623 --> 00:43.877
the Turd Burglar was contacting people
in August of last year.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.004
Was your phone ever
out of your possession, maybe,

00:46.129 --> 00:47.589
-during that time?
-I...

00:50.341 --> 00:51.551
I don't know.

00:52.260 --> 00:53.303
I can check.

00:56.097 --> 00:56.931
[Brooke huffs]

00:57.599 --> 00:59.893
"Broke my phone,
won't have it for the night.

00:59.976 --> 01:01.561
Hit me up here if you need me."

01:01.686 --> 01:03.271
Okay, and what date was that?

01:03.396 --> 01:05.106
-August 6th.
-August 6th.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.317
Okay, is there anything else
you remember from that day?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.860
Anything else that you can tell us?

01:10.612 --> 01:11.905
Yeah, I remember...

01:12.739 --> 01:14.365
I was FaceTiming my boyfriend,

01:14.741 --> 01:17.285
and I didn't look where I was walking.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.290
I've dropped my phone, like,
a million times,

01:22.373 --> 01:24.375
but this time it hit every step
on the way down

01:24.459 --> 01:28.505
and just, like, completely shattered.
I couldn't even unlock it...

01:28.671 --> 01:31.257
without... glass on my fingers.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.427
So I looked on Yelp
for a place to fix it and...

01:34.719 --> 01:37.639
I called them and they said they
would have it done in under an hour,

01:38.056 --> 01:39.891
but I showed up and this guy...

01:40.850 --> 01:42.936
said that he needed it overnight,

01:43.686 --> 01:44.521
and...

01:45.605 --> 01:47.315
I gave him my password.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.859
-So...
-[Peter] Huh.

01:50.735 --> 01:52.237
He had access to everything.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.323
Where did you get it fixed?

01:55.448 --> 01:58.284
[sighs] It's, like, a kiosk at the mall.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.704
-[Peter] What mall?
-The Kirkland Mall.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.623
[Peter] The Kirkland Mall.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.544
Was it a Broke 2 Fixed kiosk?

02:09.504 --> 02:11.214
Yeah, that sounds right.

02:11.756 --> 02:12.882
Hold on a second.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
Was this who helped you?

02:21.599 --> 02:22.433
Yeah.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.686
I made a joke, and they kicked me out
of the fuckin' school.

03:06.853 --> 03:09.814
I discovered he was tweeting
some pretty unsavory stuff.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.193
Grayson's a weirdo, but I couldn't believe
that they actually expelled him

03:13.276 --> 03:15.111
over a few tweets about "chlamyds."

03:15.195 --> 03:16.571
Guys like Kevin and me,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.740
we are easy escape-goats.

03:19.032 --> 03:23.578
And we end up with ankle bracelets,
and a job at the fucking Kirkland Mall.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.832
[Sam] Grayson worked at the kiosk.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.879
[Sam] That's so gross to think about, man.
I mean... Think about it.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.381
Every time you take your phone
at one of those places...

03:35.465 --> 03:38.593
they have access to all your shit.
-He had a history of cyber-bullying.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.678
[Peter] He had... He has a grudge
against the school

03:40.762 --> 03:42.764
and he had access to Aby's phone,
I mean...

03:42.889 --> 03:44.891
she even identified him by photo, dude.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.728
It's him, man. Grayson's the catfish.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.480
He is the Turd Burglar.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.981
[Sam] We're fucking done, man.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.025
We take this to the police, right?

03:54.108 --> 03:56.110
Yeah. We take this to the police
and the school.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.028
What do we do now?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.530
Messaging the Turd Burglar,
letting know it's over.

04:02.158 --> 04:02.992
Hi, Greyson.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.832
[Peter] With definitive proof
of the Turd Burglars identity...

04:09.916 --> 04:12.377
Sam and I headed
to the Bellevue police station.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.420
But before we can get there...

04:14.504 --> 04:17.131
It became clear that we needed
to change our course...

04:17.382 --> 04:18.800
and head to Saint Bernardine.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.178
[Peter] We just receved a notification
from the Turd Burglar.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.390
Except, it wasn't a response to our DM.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.557
He posted something.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.102
"The Dump is coming."

04:30.728 --> 04:31.980
[Peter] He knows he's caught.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.900
[Grayson in modified voice]
Students of St. Bernardine,

04:36.067 --> 04:39.445
it would appear that you're all
about to learn my true identity.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.657
But not before I unleash
my fecal finale,

04:42.740 --> 04:44.534
and show you the complete truth.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.537
That you're all full of shit.

04:47.954 --> 04:48.955
Today at noon...

04:49.455 --> 04:50.623
prepare for The Dump.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.750
[students evacuating the building]

04:53.918 --> 04:55.920
We just had no idea
what it was going to be.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.089
The Dump? What does that even mean?

04:59.590 --> 05:02.051
I was so scared. I thought we were gonna
get pooped on.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.345
I was eyeing the ceiling for cracks.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.600
[Teacher] Any student leaving this campus
will get Saturday detention.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.312
I thought it was gonna be, like,
helicopters coming down like...

05:12.395 --> 05:15.773
[imitates machine-gun] Like, poop missiles
just blowing up everywhere.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.943
I was all like, "Fuck this.
I do not want to know what The Dump is."

05:19.027 --> 05:20.611
So I just walked out.

05:20.695 --> 05:21.988
[students chattering]

05:22.113 --> 05:25.199
But it didn't really matter,
because The Dump

05:25.533 --> 05:27.201
wasn't like the others.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.997
[Peter] Nobody saw The Dump coming.

05:31.372 --> 05:35.293
It was Grayson's darkest,
most impactful crime yet.

05:35.793 --> 05:39.630
But ironically, The Dump was
the first Turd Burglar crime...

05:39.756 --> 05:41.174
void of any turds.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.427
It was an information dump.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.471
Grayson posted a download link

05:46.554 --> 05:49.891
containing dozens
of compromising photos and videos

05:50.224 --> 05:51.476
sent to Brooke Wheeler,

05:51.601 --> 05:54.687
the persona Grayson used
to blackmail his victims,

05:54.896 --> 05:56.731
and to performing his poop crimes.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.691
These pictures that I sent her....

06:00.610 --> 06:01.611
They're, like...

06:02.862 --> 06:05.406
you know, like, super suggestive photos.

06:06.491 --> 06:10.536
I just feel, like, so stupid
because I thought she was a real person.

06:10.661 --> 06:12.789
[Brooke] I miss you so much, Pickle.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.375
[Peter] And Jenna wasn't alone.

06:15.666 --> 06:18.920
There were three other victims
who fell for the catfish,

06:19.420 --> 06:21.422
including the Tech Ed teacher,

06:21.506 --> 06:22.840
Mr. Gesualdi.

06:22.924 --> 06:29.305
I really wish I had not seen
those pictures of Mr. Gesualdi. [sighs]

06:29.430 --> 06:31.849
Faculty member, Matthew Gesualdi,

06:31.933 --> 06:35.686
has confessed to committing the crime
in the faculty lounge.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.272
He has resigned, effective immediately.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.859
[Peter] Drew Pankratz was also a victim.

06:42.193 --> 06:45.113
He was already infamous
for the embarrassing photos

06:45.196 --> 06:48.032
of him in a diaper
that leaked months earlier.

06:48.491 --> 06:50.910
But those photos pale in comparison...

06:51.202 --> 06:52.453
to the video he sent.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.956
My God. I mean, that video of Drew...

06:55.540 --> 06:57.708
How is that even possible?
Like, physically?

06:58.626 --> 07:03.631
It was actually kind of cool, I guess.
I mean, I guess he's pretty flexible.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.802
God did not design us to bend that way.
Certainly not for that reason.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.554
[Peter] With The Dump,

07:09.679 --> 07:12.849
the Turd Burglar was making
his biggest statement to date;

07:13.182 --> 07:15.184
a statement heard around the country,

07:15.518 --> 07:18.271
thanks in part to the stature
of his fourth victim,

07:19.105 --> 07:20.189
DeMarcus Tillman.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.025
Let's talk about DeMarcus Tillman.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.445
You gotta question
where this guy's head's at.

07:25.611 --> 07:29.073
Instead of working on his handles,
and putting up Js in the gym,

07:29.157 --> 07:32.994
this guy is sending pics of his junk
to a catfish,

07:33.077 --> 07:34.620
and doing poop pranks.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.872
Red flags all around it.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.040
He's a great player,
but the catfishing thing?

07:38.124 --> 07:40.168
Can't escape it.
Gonna be a big distraction.

07:40.460 --> 07:44.505
DeMarcus Tillman, of all people,
I can't believe he fell for a catfish.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.384
I was, like, "Why are you talking
to fake online girls? I'm right here.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.136
I don't care that you're uncircumcised.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.056
[Sam] DeMarcus was the fourth
and final victim of The Dump.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.683
[Peter] He was one of four people

07:55.766 --> 07:58.352
who were coerced
into performing poop crimes.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.981
And now his private photos
were exposed to the world...

08:02.273 --> 08:03.357
by Grayson Wentz.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.861
Witness testimony has led Bellevue Police
to reopen the case.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.155
Former St. Bernardine student,
Grayson Wentz,

08:09.238 --> 08:11.449
has been taken into custody
without incident.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.034
He will face charges for crimes

08:13.117 --> 08:15.745
that former St. Bernardine junior,
Kevin McClain,

08:15.828 --> 08:18.122
confessed to in November of last year.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.460
[Peter]
They've actually got Grayson in custody.

08:22.585 --> 08:25.129
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:25.671 --> 08:29.008
-[Kevin tapping his grandmother's hand]
-So what's next for Kevin?

08:30.676 --> 08:32.553
You should probably get a lawyer
just to be safe,

08:32.637 --> 08:36.015
but, I mean, I can only imagine that
his sentence is going to be overturned...

08:36.557 --> 08:38.851
[Peter]
Kevin McClain had been intimidated,

08:39.227 --> 08:40.228
manipulated,

08:40.770 --> 08:41.812
isolated.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.856
But The Dump changed everything.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.319
There were four crimes committed...
and four people blackmailed,

08:48.736 --> 08:51.030
none of whom were Kevin McClain.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.033
[Sam] You actually knew Grayson Wentz.
Right?

08:56.452 --> 08:57.286
I did.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.874
[Grayson laughs] Fruit Ninja!

09:01.958 --> 09:04.418
-[Kevin] Fruit Ninja.
-[Grayson] The Fruit Ninja, man!

09:04.502 --> 09:08.214
In fact, there was a time I might have
even called him a friend.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.551
What do you think of him now?

09:12.260 --> 09:14.262
[Kevin huffs]

09:16.305 --> 09:18.516
I can't believe what he was capable of.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.022
[Petrer] Why did Grayson go down
such a dark path?

09:25.648 --> 09:28.150
And how did he choose his four victims?

09:29.151 --> 09:30.987
We'd unraveled so much,

09:31.362 --> 09:33.990
but there were still plenty
of loose threads.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.201
So the computer teacher, Mr. Gesualdi,
confessed to doing the Crap Calendar.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.536
-[Sam] Yeah.
-So that we know.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.789
Then we got Shit Launcher,
and Jenna Hawthorne confessed to that.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.583
-[Sam] Yes, she did.
-So she did that.

09:44.458 --> 09:48.170
And now that leaves us with the Brownout,
and the Poop Piñata,

09:48.254 --> 09:49.797
and two blackmail victims.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.091
So, which one do you think
DeMarcus did?

09:53.968 --> 09:55.845
[Sam]
I guess there's only one way to find out.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.269
[wind blowing]

10:07.898 --> 10:10.985
-[Peter huffs]
-[Sam] Pete, maybe just knock, dude.

10:14.989 --> 10:18.618
-Hi, Mr. Tillman, is DeMarcus home?
-We're not taking visitors right now.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.454
[Peter] Okay, I was just wondering
if I could maybe speak

10:21.537 --> 10:24.540
-really quickly with DeMarcus and---
-Yo, Pete, get the fuck out of here.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.460
[Peter] I just thought that maybe
he might want to share his side of the--

10:29.128 --> 10:30.254
Goddamn.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.464
[DeMarkus] Pete.

10:32.381 --> 10:33.883
-[Peter] Hey, can we--
-Let's talk, man.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.217
[Peter] Awesome.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.886
-Thanks, dude.
-[Mr. Tillman] DeMarcus!

10:37.219 --> 10:38.804
Come on back here, boy!

10:39.764 --> 10:42.058
[Peter] Hop in the passenger seat.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.559
[Mr. Tillman] Are you joking?

10:48.939 --> 10:50.274
[DeMarkus] Man, it's embarrassing.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.236
People see your dick pics,

10:54.779 --> 10:58.157
whole school talkin' 'bout it look like
my dick got a turtleneck on.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.284
I keep trying to explain to people,

11:00.368 --> 11:02.745
outside the United States,
that's how dicks be looking.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.872
But that ain't cultured. Whatever.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.334
The worst part is...

11:09.877 --> 11:11.629
people know I got catfished.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.839
DeMarcus Tillman, catfished.

11:14.840 --> 11:15.883
By a dude.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.721
[huffs]

11:23.808 --> 11:26.811
More than anything, man,
I feel bad for the people at school.

11:28.145 --> 11:30.106
I mean, Miss M.

11:30.481 --> 11:32.274
She's corny, yes, who cares?

11:33.275 --> 11:35.486
But she don't deserve shit
in her eyelashes.

11:37.196 --> 11:40.658
Like, that's fucked up.
I feel bad as shit for that.

11:42.660 --> 11:46.539
-[Peter] So you did the Poop Piñata?
-Yeah. I did it, yeah.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.584
[Peter] Would you mind walking us through
how you did it?

11:51.001 --> 11:53.003
[DeMarkus huffs]

11:53.087 --> 11:56.090
A'ight, she told me
to meet her in some alley.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.719
[DeMarkus] I walk in the alley
and there's a package.

12:00.845 --> 12:01.721
I open it up.

12:02.888 --> 12:05.766
And there's just, like,
these big bags full of shit.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.272
And then I pull out a Turd Burglar card,
and then it was some directions,

12:12.064 --> 12:15.317
and then she had printed out pictures
of every embarrassing thing I ever sent.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.070
Said if I don't do it,

12:18.195 --> 12:19.780
she was gonna spread around
my dick pics.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.116
So, yeah.

12:22.950 --> 12:23.784
I did it.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.580
Looking back at it,
I wish I would have just been like,

12:27.663 --> 12:31.667
"Fuck you, bitch. You shit-loving bitch.
I'll call the FBI. Fuck you."

12:34.503 --> 12:35.796
Instead, I said nothing,

12:36.130 --> 12:38.215
and she still spread around my dick pics.

12:41.469 --> 12:42.970
Can we talk about Brooke?

12:46.307 --> 12:48.976
You don't have to answer
if you don't feel comfortable, but...

12:50.811 --> 12:54.064
why do you think that she was able
to manipulate you?

12:54.398 --> 12:57.026
You know, like all the girls
at this school, you know, they...

12:57.693 --> 12:59.361
they're obsessed with you, so...

12:59.862 --> 13:02.198
why this girl that you've never even met?

13:05.618 --> 13:06.494
I don't know.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.041
I think I just wanted it
to be real so bad.

13:14.335 --> 13:15.753
We started off normal.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.755
She was liking a lot of my pics.

13:18.964 --> 13:21.050
I was just thinking
it's a thottie tryin' to smash,

13:21.133 --> 13:23.302
so I slide in her DMs...

13:25.221 --> 13:26.972
You know how it is...

13:28.849 --> 13:30.351
One day we was just talkin'.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.771
I remember thinking, like,
"Yo, she different."

13:35.272 --> 13:37.358
[DeMarkus]
She didn't care that I was the man.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.152
She didn't even watch sports.
She didn't care that I hoop.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.278
She liked me.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.572
When I started getting rank,

13:43.781 --> 13:46.992
everybody either, they started
acting like they was scared to talk to me,

13:47.243 --> 13:48.744
or they was just acting like

13:48.828 --> 13:50.621
they was my best fucking friend
and shit.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.666
That shit is alienating.
People don't understand.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.627
Like, when you're in a position
where everybody's looking at you,

13:56.710 --> 13:58.671
nobody's honest with you.

13:59.213 --> 14:02.633
It's hard to know what's real
when nobody's real with you.

14:03.592 --> 14:07.096
Like, I'm not from the same world
as those kids at St. Bernie.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.348
This is where I grew up at.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.143
And all of those people,
they might act like they love me,

14:13.686 --> 14:15.521
you know,
and sometimes I feel like they do.

14:16.814 --> 14:20.025
It just don't feel real.
It don't feel genuine.

14:21.527 --> 14:22.778
But with Brooke,

14:23.070 --> 14:24.196
it was different.

14:25.072 --> 14:28.909
[Peter]
A conversation from November 2nd, 2017.

14:29.076 --> 14:32.329
[DeMarkus] Everyone's so nice to my face,
but it doesn't feel right, you know?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.206
I just don't trust anyone.

14:34.748 --> 14:37.668
-[Brooke] What about Lou?
-[DeMarkus] Especially Lou.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.588
Hate saying it,
because he's all I got at Bernie,

14:40.796 --> 14:42.298
but I know he's finessing,

14:42.423 --> 14:45.301
talking to recruiters behind my back,
all that shit.

14:45.759 --> 14:49.638
I don't even know if he likes me anymore.
I don't know if anyone really does.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.015
[Brooke] I do.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.641
I really like you.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.727
[DeMarkus] I really like you too.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.479
[DeMarkus]
That's why I kept it so real wit' her.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.150
Then when I found out she was
just playing me too, it was just...

15:02.735 --> 15:04.069
[sighs]

15:04.153 --> 15:06.196
That shit fuck with you, man.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.532
That shit fuck with you hard.

15:12.870 --> 15:13.871
[DeMarkus sniffs]

15:14.455 --> 15:15.414
[Demarkus] Hey, Sam.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.790
Yeah.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.792
You see my dick pic?

15:22.922 --> 15:23.797
[Sam] Yeah.

15:27.551 --> 15:30.721
[Peter] We had to look at it
for the documentary, so--

15:30.930 --> 15:33.682
[DeMarkus laughs]
Nah, man, it's cool. I was curious.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.018
It's just weird, though.

15:36.226 --> 15:38.062
Like, I'm talking to two dudes
I met a month ago

15:38.145 --> 15:39.521
and both of y'all seen my dick.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.858
-[Sam] Yeah.
-[DeMarkus laughs]

15:45.152 --> 15:46.612
[Sam] I mean, I'm sorry, man.

15:46.862 --> 15:47.821
It's cool.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.616
Shit, it could be worse.
I could be like Drew Pankratz.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.743
Yo, you saw that video?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.079
That shit is fucking crazy.

15:55.579 --> 15:58.082
How you fit the whole thing in there?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.669
I hope that dude doing a'ight.

16:02.586 --> 16:05.047
[Peter] So, we now know
that DeMarcus did the Poop Piñata.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.008
Jenna Hawthorne did the Shit Launcher,

16:08.092 --> 16:10.636
and Mr. Gesualdi did the Crap Calendar.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.681
Which leaves one less crime,
and one last blackmail victim.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.183
[Father] Let me tell you about Drew.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.477
I mean, he's a theater kid,
who lives in the friend zone.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.145
[girl] He's like a brother to me.

16:20.229 --> 16:21.939
My parents let him sleep over
all the time.

16:22.147 --> 16:24.149
Like, I can change in front of him.

16:24.441 --> 16:26.193
That's how asexual the situation is.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.320
[Father] And then the pictures came out.

16:28.404 --> 16:33.033
[boy] There were picture leaks of him
in, like, diapers with baby bottles.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.536
I'm not sure if it's some sort of
weird fetish.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.246
I just really want to know
who it was for.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.625
[Peter] Thank you so much
for sitting down with us, Drew.

16:41.959 --> 16:42.960
So, would you...

16:43.210 --> 16:46.213
Would you actually care to speak
on that video? I mean, how much...

16:46.296 --> 16:47.381
[Sam sighs]

16:48.340 --> 16:49.591
practice did that take?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.636
I don't really want to talk
about the video.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.222
You don't have to.
Just, forget about it. [chuckles]

16:55.305 --> 16:57.599
-So you met Brooke online, right?
-Yeah.

16:57.766 --> 16:59.935
And how did she get you
to do the Brownout?

17:02.187 --> 17:04.273
I didn't do the Brownout.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.778
Well, we... We know
who did all the other four crimes,

17:09.862 --> 17:11.238
so by process of elimination--

17:11.321 --> 17:13.907
Look, no, I'm telling you,
I didn't do it.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.286
She asked me to.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.163
But...

17:19.788 --> 17:20.706
I said no.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.168
She already had some photos of me,
so,

17:25.002 --> 17:27.337
that's when she started
to blackmail me.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.466
So Brooke leaked the photos.

17:31.341 --> 17:32.676
Yeah, she...

17:33.552 --> 17:36.430
She said she had a diaper fetish,

17:36.764 --> 17:37.598
and...

17:38.015 --> 17:41.477
Honestly, it was the first time a girl
seemed to take me seriously,

17:41.560 --> 17:43.896
so I went along with it.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.731
Biggest mistake of my life.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.610
So, you knew about the Brownout

17:50.194 --> 17:51.612
and you didn't say anything?

17:53.572 --> 17:54.406
Yeah.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.449
Are you serious?

17:55.532 --> 17:57.826
I mean, she still had the video.

17:59.453 --> 18:00.329
Oh.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.791
Yeah, no, I wouldn't have said anything.

18:04.374 --> 18:05.918
Yeah, no shit.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.170
Now everyone knows how...

18:09.171 --> 18:10.380
you know...

18:10.714 --> 18:12.257
flexible I am.

18:13.425 --> 18:16.428
[Brooke] Your nice-guy best-friend act
isn't fooling me.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.139
If you don't,
I'll show the school the pictures,

18:19.223 --> 18:21.850
so they can see
how desperate you are to get laid.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.103
[Drew] Please, Brooke, don't.

18:24.436 --> 18:28.398
[Brooke] And if you tell anyone about me,
I'll release the videos.

18:28.690 --> 18:29.858
[Drew] Not the videos.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.318
Please, Brooke.

18:31.568 --> 18:34.655
It felt good twice,
but it doesn't feel good anymore.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.073
I don't get it.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.784
If there are four crimes
and four blackmail victims,

18:38.867 --> 18:41.912
if you didn't do the Brownout
then who did the Brownout?

18:44.081 --> 18:47.459
I don't know.
All I know is it wasn't me.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.712
[Peter] Four blackmail victims,

18:51.171 --> 18:52.881
four Turd Burglar crimes.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.009
But if Drew Pankratz didn't do
the Brownout,

18:56.343 --> 18:58.637
then why didn't
The Dump include blackmail

18:58.762 --> 19:00.430
of the individual who did?

19:01.014 --> 19:03.475
There was still a dingleberry
of information...

19:03.809 --> 19:04.893
that we didn't have.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.436
Fortunately,

19:06.895 --> 19:09.189
Grayson's trial unearthed new evidence.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.610
He had wiped his phone and laptop
before police raided his house.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.613
But Washington State's
Technology Crimes Unit

19:16.697 --> 19:18.782
was able to recover most of the data.

19:19.199 --> 19:23.203
That included Grayson's conversations
and all of his passwords,

19:23.287 --> 19:26.498
which led to the discovery
of several angry videos

19:26.707 --> 19:30.043
posted to 4chan and YouTube
after his expulsion.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.422
I got expelled today
and no one seems to care.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.550
They're talking about it on Twitter.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.012
Let's see my classmates are saying.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.139
"Grayson Wentz is a creep.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.391
I'm glad he's expelled."

19:44.600 --> 19:47.144
"Fuck Grayson Wentz.
He's a piece of shit."

19:47.227 --> 19:49.021
[laughs] A piece of shit?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.525
I'm the only one not hiding on Instagram
fishing for likes,

19:53.609 --> 19:55.027
and I'm the fucking piece of shit?

19:55.110 --> 19:58.655
[Peter] He began obsessively following
his former classmates,

19:58.864 --> 20:00.365
digitally stalking them.

20:00.949 --> 20:02.117
Their social media...

20:02.451 --> 20:04.828
became his only connection to the world.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.706
He devoured every detail he could.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.124
Every post.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.876
Every profile.

20:11.668 --> 20:14.963
But the more he consumed,
the sicker it made him.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.257
Instagram filters, Snapchat filters.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.051
They're not fucking filters,
they're masks.

20:19.134 --> 20:22.054
You all pretend to lead these
perfect, happy lives

20:22.137 --> 20:24.556
when you're just as lonely as me.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.601
You're fucking fake.
You're fucking plastic.

20:28.227 --> 20:32.105
[Peter] Grayson believed that behind
their happy social media profiles,

20:32.272 --> 20:35.359
they were just as insecure
and lonely as he was.

20:36.652 --> 20:40.072
He wanted to make them pay for being
so desperately artificial.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.323
[kids screaming]

20:41.406 --> 20:44.117
[Peter] And prove that they were,
quite literally,

20:44.493 --> 20:45.494
full of shit.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.373
The recovered data from Grayson's trial

20:49.456 --> 20:53.001
also revealed
that he didn't just target the four people

20:53.085 --> 20:54.670
who were exposed in The Dump.

20:55.170 --> 20:59.091
He reached out to as many faculty
and students as he could.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.426
He was fishing.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.387
I heard the name "Brooke Wheeler"

21:03.470 --> 21:05.347
and it sounded kind of familiar
and I was, like,

21:06.348 --> 21:08.558
''wait a minute, she DM'd me too.''

21:09.059 --> 21:11.144
When she asked for pictures
of my privates,

21:11.436 --> 21:12.938
I told her I didn't feel comfortable.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.816
That's what she just stop messaging me
altogether.

21:15.941 --> 21:19.361
I obviously knew it was, like,
some sort of bot or whatever,

21:19.444 --> 21:20.570
because...

21:21.947 --> 21:24.324
[Peter] Grayson didn't need everyone
to take the bait,

21:24.741 --> 21:27.369
just the ones
who were desperate enough to do so.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.747
A small number of people
responded to Brooke,

21:31.123 --> 21:35.043
and an even smaller number
engaged in prolonged conversation.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.255
Grayson found that Jenna, DeMarcus,

21:38.338 --> 21:40.340
Drew, and Mr. Gesualdi

21:40.799 --> 21:42.926
were all particularly vulnerable.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.887
[flashback] I think I just wanted it
to be real so bad.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.139
[Peter] With Brooke,

21:47.347 --> 21:51.643
Grayson was able to attract people
who were longing for a deeper connection.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.563
[flashbacks] I feel like
I can talk to you forever. Everyone's

21:54.646 --> 21:56.481
so fake, but I can just be real with you.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.775
[Drew] You don't know how it feels
to have found someone

21:58.859 --> 21:59.818
who takes me seriously.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.821
[Jena] I wish I could talk to everyone
like I can talk to you.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.614
She told me that she loved me.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.491
And I thought she did.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.703
And I thought that I loved her back.

22:10.454 --> 22:13.040
[Peter] He used their own loneliness
against them...

22:13.123 --> 22:15.208
to get back at the school
that he hated,

22:15.584 --> 22:18.920
including the teacher responsible
for his expulsion.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.840
[Gesualdi] I discovered he was tweeting
some pretty unsavory stuff.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.383
As  you probably are aware,

22:23.467 --> 22:27.012
these computers are supposed to be
used for nothing but schoolwork...

22:27.179 --> 22:30.390
[Peter] Grayson took great pleasure
in pointing out the hypocrisy.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.893
[Brooke and Grayson]
Your self-righteousness makes me laugh.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.394
Put the crap in the calendar,

22:34.478 --> 22:36.813
or I'll show you the world
all the unsavory stuff

22:36.897 --> 22:39.316
you're sending young girls
from school computers.

22:39.816 --> 22:43.487
And he relished the power he held
over the people who opened up to him.

22:43.570 --> 22:44.780
[Grayson] Everyone can see

22:44.863 --> 22:47.032
that behind your pretty, little,
rich-girl Instagrams...

22:47.157 --> 22:49.326
Your nice-guy, best-friend act
isn't fooling me..

22:49.409 --> 22:50.619
You're no hero, you're a phony.

22:50.702 --> 22:54.122
This was no prank.
These were the actions of an individual

22:54.206 --> 22:55.957
completely lacking...

22:56.708 --> 22:59.211
any form of empathy.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.296
The victims of your crimes...

23:01.380 --> 23:02.422
[Peter] In total,

23:02.547 --> 23:05.675
Grayson reached out to 41 people
as Brooke Wheeler.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.887
He exchanged over 30,000 messages

23:08.970 --> 23:11.807
between August 12th
and December 4th.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.310
But of all the conversations
uncovered at the trial,

23:15.769 --> 23:19.189
Grayson's longest,
most intimate exchanges,

23:19.773 --> 23:24.694
were not with DeMarcus, Jenna,
Drew, or Mr. Gesualdi.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.115
They were with Kevin McClain.

23:32.202 --> 23:33.328
[Kevin] I'm sorry, Peter.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.584
I couldn't tell you.
I couldn't tell anyone.

23:41.336 --> 23:42.212
Tell us what?

23:44.631 --> 23:46.466
[takes a deep breath]

23:46.591 --> 23:47.717
I did the Brownout.

23:50.887 --> 23:53.557
Kevin, if you had told the police
that you were being blackmailed,

23:53.640 --> 23:55.392
they probably would have helped you

23:55.559 --> 23:57.644
-or been a little easier--
-I couldn't.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.271
Why?

24:00.981 --> 24:02.107
[huffs]

24:03.358 --> 24:05.068
Because I wasn't blackmailed.

24:08.989 --> 24:13.285
When I first met Brooke,
I was instantly smitten.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.954
We had so much in common.
[chuckles]

24:16.079 --> 24:20.584
We had similar tastes in movies, TV.

24:21.251 --> 24:24.463
We bonded over the same critiques
of Rick &amp; Morty.

24:25.088 --> 24:29.092
She made me feel all these things
I had never felt before.

24:29.968 --> 24:33.722
[Peter]
A conversation from October 28th, 2017.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.308
One week before the Brownout.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.310
[Brooke] I thought
everyone at school loved you.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.644
You're the Fruit Ninja.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.063
[Kevin] Nobody really wants to be
the Fruit Ninja.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.608
I've just never really been good
at fitting in,

24:44.691 --> 24:46.985
so at some point I decided
to do the opposite.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.279
And I did everything I could
to convince myself

24:49.362 --> 24:51.156
that I didn't need people
to like me.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.325
[Brooke] That's why I like you.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.785
I hate people
who need everyone's approval.

24:56.703 --> 24:57.537
[Kevin] Maybe,

24:57.871 --> 25:00.540
but sometimes I wonder
if I have anyone's approval.

25:00.999 --> 25:02.375
Even Tanner and Chloe.

25:03.001 --> 25:05.921
Sometimes I wonder if they're laughing
behind my back like everyone else.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.964
I wouldn't even blame them.

25:08.340 --> 25:12.093
[Brooke] You have my approval, Pickle.
I think I'm falling in love with you.

25:14.054 --> 25:17.432
I felt close to her in a way
that I have...

25:18.558 --> 25:20.852
never felt with anyone.

25:21.686 --> 25:22.521
[Peter] In many ways,

25:23.313 --> 25:25.232
Kevin was Grayson's easiest target.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.192
-[Grayson] Fruit Ninja!
-[Kevin] Fruit Ninja!.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.110
[Peter]
The two had been childhood friends,

25:29.986 --> 25:32.989
so Grayson knew about Kevin's
sixth grade nickname.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.909
-[boy shouting] Hey, Shit Stain McClain!
-[kids laughing]

25:35.992 --> 25:38.745
-[officer] Did you like that nickname?
-No.

25:38.828 --> 25:43.959
That name, it destroyed Kevin.
And it was huge for Nick Sondergoth.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.587
[Peter] And Grayson knew how much Kevin
still resented the kid...

25:47.879 --> 25:49.089
who created it.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.216
[officer] You changed seats, Kevin.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.052
Did you enjoy watching Nick Sondergoth
poop his pants?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.889
[Peter]
Grayson planted the seeds for revenge.

25:58.890 --> 26:02.394
And Kevin thought he could impress Brooke
by sticking up for himself.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.273
Together they laughed about
how fitting it would be

26:06.398 --> 26:09.651
to see Nick Sondergoth
and the rest of the kids who bullied him,

26:10.026 --> 26:11.653
get such a suitable comeuppance.

26:13.196 --> 26:14.739
[Kevin] Love had blinded me.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.617
I was willing to do...

26:18.702 --> 26:20.829
anything to impress her.

26:23.498 --> 26:25.667
She wanted me to do the Brownout,
so...

26:28.461 --> 26:29.754
I did the Brownout.

26:32.007 --> 26:33.258
[Sam] How did it all happen?

26:36.720 --> 26:38.388
[Kevin] Well, she sent me the maltitol.

26:39.139 --> 26:42.767
She said that it was going to work
better than any store-bought laxative,

26:42.851 --> 26:44.477
and that no one would get hurt.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.396
[students evacuating the building]

26:46.563 --> 26:48.982
There was a fire drill scheduled
for November 6th.

26:50.233 --> 26:53.278
It was the perfect opportunity
to enter the kitchen unnoticed.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.574
I quickly found the lemonade dispenser
and I...

26:58.575 --> 27:00.327
deposited the maltitol.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.079
I'm ashamed to admit this,
but it was...

27:04.372 --> 27:05.206
thrilling.

27:06.124 --> 27:07.667
Until I was... [chuckles]

27:08.418 --> 27:10.253
seated in the cafeteria, of course.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.715
I had no idea so many people

27:13.798 --> 27:15.216
drank that fucking lemonade.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.053
You know, it's not even made
with real lemons.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.597
[Sam] Let's talk about the horchata.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.434
Did you knock over Brother Buckley's
lemonade on purpose?

27:24.976 --> 27:26.144
Yes.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.021
I did. Of course.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.607
He's not exactly in pristine health.
Okay?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.484
I felt responsible for him.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.277
I didn't want anyone to get hurt.

27:35.945 --> 27:38.323
[Peter]
Did it turn out the way you anticipated?

27:46.331 --> 27:47.707
It was like a bad dream.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.085
[girl crying]

27:50.710 --> 27:51.878
[Kevin] It was soul-shaking.

27:55.423 --> 27:58.093
[Petrr] Did anyone else know
that you were speaking to Brooke?

27:59.052 --> 28:00.011
No.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.597
I hadn't told anyone about Brooke,

28:02.681 --> 28:03.682
but obviously, [sighs]

28:04.432 --> 28:06.142
DeMarcus figured it out.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.731
[Kevin] He didn't want me speaking to you
because he was afraid.

28:12.482 --> 28:13.400
[Peter] Of what?

28:14.150 --> 28:15.527
[Kevin] Exactly what happened.

28:16.403 --> 28:20.156
All of our pictures
and conversations getting released.

28:21.116 --> 28:25.078
[Peter] And when did you realize
that Brooke wasn't who she said she was?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.082
I was supposed to meet Brooke.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.335
The night after the Brownout.

28:32.919 --> 28:36.548
It was the only thing that was getting me
through a rather traumatic day.

28:37.006 --> 28:38.550
[Peter] Where were you supposed to meet?

28:41.261 --> 28:43.513
At the Holiday Inn on Route 2.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.269
The previous day I had...

28:50.395 --> 28:53.565
[huffs] ...picked some things up
at Dassey's.

28:55.692 --> 28:58.695
[Peter] Is that when Tanner thought
that you were buying laxatives?

28:58.778 --> 28:59.863
-Yes.
-Ah.

29:00.280 --> 29:05.160
I'm almost positive that he had laxatives
in that Dassey's bag.

29:05.285 --> 29:09.539
-[Peter] So what did you buy?
-I bought...

29:11.583 --> 29:12.459
[Kevin] ...adult...

29:13.543 --> 29:14.586
paraphernalia.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.254
Prophylactics.

29:16.963 --> 29:19.632
I didn't tell Tanner
because I was embarrassed.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.180
I got there early.

29:30.268 --> 29:33.354
I texted Brooke after 20 minutes or so,

29:33.772 --> 29:35.190
telling her the room number.

29:36.149 --> 29:38.067
And I waited... [huffs]

29:39.736 --> 29:40.695
...and waited.

29:41.654 --> 29:42.989
[Peter] At 8:48 p.m.,

29:43.364 --> 29:44.574
on November 6th,

29:45.325 --> 29:49.746
Brooke sent one final message to Kevin,
before blocking him.

29:49.913 --> 29:52.540
[Brooke] You act like you're smarter
than everyone else,

29:52.665 --> 29:54.459
but everything about you is fake.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.753
The way you dress.

29:57.754 --> 29:58.922
The way you talk.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.882
You're full of shit.

30:02.050 --> 30:02.967
Just like me.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.304
[Kevin] I never heard from her again.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.807
And just like that...

30:12.018 --> 30:13.353
I had no one.

30:14.938 --> 30:15.772
Hey, Pickle.

30:17.190 --> 30:19.526
I'm going to bed and I wanted
to say goodnight.

30:19.734 --> 30:22.362
[Kevin] This girl
that I fell in love with...

30:25.114 --> 30:27.283
had never existed. [huffs]

30:33.248 --> 30:34.207
[Sam] Can I...

30:34.833 --> 30:36.584
Can I just ask you one more question?

30:38.878 --> 30:39.712
Well,

30:39.963 --> 30:41.297
if you did the Brownout,

30:42.715 --> 30:43.967
doesn't that mean that...

30:44.217 --> 30:45.844
you shit your pants on purpose?

30:52.016 --> 30:52.851
Yeah.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.107
[Peter] How do you feel
now knowing Kevin's involvement

30:59.190 --> 31:00.400
in the Turd Burglar crimes?

31:02.819 --> 31:07.031
Well, I thought I was going crazy...
throughout the entire process.

31:07.115 --> 31:09.450
I mean, I know Kevin better than anyone,

31:09.534 --> 31:12.120
and I just knew
when he was acting up.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.373
At first I was...

31:15.874 --> 31:18.167
[gulps] I felt really betrayed.

31:20.336 --> 31:22.297
You know? I really believed in him.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.883
And I went to bat for him.

31:25.216 --> 31:29.053
My life is very different
because of how hard I fought for him.

31:33.057 --> 31:36.269
But I guess I should have just gone
and talked to him about it.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.772
Instead of going to the school
and ratting him out,

31:39.856 --> 31:41.983
I should have just been a better friend.

31:43.735 --> 31:44.569
Then...

31:46.279 --> 31:49.282
I read his texts with Brooke and...

31:50.408 --> 31:53.036
[Chloe]
Just to see how Grayson manipulated him.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.247
And yeah, my life is different now.

31:57.123 --> 32:00.126
But it doesn't even come close
to what Kevin went through.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.178
I guess...

32:13.890 --> 32:15.975
I guess, I just didn't really realize...

32:16.726 --> 32:17.977
how lonely he was.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.287
[DeMarkus]
Man, I don't know. Life is crazy.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.332
I came to the realization

33:21.749 --> 33:24.919
that life is a lot more like basketball
than I thought.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.964
Like for instance,
when I'm on the court,

33:28.047 --> 33:30.842
I'm in control, handle the ball,
I shoot it,

33:31.009 --> 33:32.844
I tear down my own rebounds.

33:33.594 --> 33:36.305
It's like, I'm DeMarcus Tillman,
I'm in control,

33:36.472 --> 33:37.807
but in real life,

33:38.141 --> 33:40.852
it's like I'm on the fucking bench.
Feels like I'm Squeaky.

33:40.935 --> 33:42.895
And everybody else making calls.

33:43.479 --> 33:46.149
So from that point forward,

33:47.567 --> 33:48.943
I got off the bench.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.112
I got my driver's license.

33:51.654 --> 33:55.324
I'm looking after my own calendar,
making my own college decisions.

33:55.783 --> 33:57.910
Lou and my dad wanted me to go Oregon.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.746
In the fall of 2019,

34:00.580 --> 34:02.749
-[cameras flashing and clicking]
-I'll be attending...

34:02.957 --> 34:04.125
Villanova University.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.377
[everybody cheering]

34:07.670 --> 34:11.132
[DeMarkus] I just want to do my own thing.
I'm making decisions.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.634
Game time.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.890
Raise your hand
if you want to play basketball.

34:19.807 --> 34:22.685
Yeah? Raise your hand
if you want to go to the NBA.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.730
Okay, one of you tell me
what you have to do...

34:26.314 --> 34:27.899
...to make it to the NBA?

34:28.274 --> 34:30.193
I'm the most happy
when I'm on the court.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.904
That's why I really started playing
basketball, I really enjoyed it.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.323
Outside of just being, like,
really, really good,

34:35.448 --> 34:36.491
like, I liked it first.

34:37.617 --> 34:39.744
That's me, that's the real DeMarcus,

34:40.119 --> 34:41.954
you know, just playing in the park.

34:42.580 --> 34:44.123
I kind of want to get back to that,

34:44.248 --> 34:47.752
and I want to get back
to feeling that same joy...

34:48.127 --> 34:50.129
when I'm not playing basketball too.

34:52.006 --> 34:54.008
Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy gifts

34:54.092 --> 34:56.135
which we are about to receive
through thy bounty,

34:56.260 --> 34:57.887
Christ Our Lord, amen.

34:57.970 --> 34:58.888
Amen.

34:59.514 --> 35:01.641
[Kevin] I am still very much an atheist,

35:01.808 --> 35:03.851
but if it gives my grandmother
some peace of mind

35:03.935 --> 35:05.937
to believe in a fairy tale,

35:06.020 --> 35:06.896
so be it.

35:06.979 --> 35:10.858
it is not Christians I hate,
it's the institution.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.821
[Tanner] You say that, but just wait till
somebody requests a Christian rock song.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.739
You're gonna lose your shit
like you always do.

35:16.823 --> 35:19.992
That's because Christian rock offends me
more as a musician.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.661
[Kevin] It feels good

35:22.078 --> 35:24.330
to have Tanner and Chloe
back in my life.

35:26.374 --> 35:29.836
I will not be returning to St. Bernardine.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.339
I'm going to public school
for my senior year.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.676
I'm excited for a fresh start.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.930
I have a good feeling.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.349
I think it'll be a good year.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.022
You know, Peter, Sam.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.233
I really mean this.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.570
I hope that we keep in touch.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.364
On social, you know?

36:00.158 --> 36:01.117
Or...

36:03.119 --> 36:04.078
in real life.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.168
[mobile phone buzzes]

36:13.004 --> 36:16.048
[Peter] We're the first generation
that gets to live twice.

36:17.550 --> 36:21.721
Our existences are simultaneously
experienced...

36:21.846 --> 36:23.097
and curated.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.141
Presented.

36:25.766 --> 36:26.767
Packaged.

36:27.435 --> 36:29.979
Polished for our own protection.

36:30.980 --> 36:35.109
Digital fortresses
made of bits, bytes, and pixels.

36:36.110 --> 36:38.321
Walls made of zeros and ones.

36:39.655 --> 36:43.284
Grayson referred to these digital walls
as masks,

36:43.826 --> 36:47.288
and he created the Turd Burglar
to prove that behind them,

36:47.872 --> 36:49.290
we're all full of shit.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.294
It would be easy to dismiss his messages,

36:53.419 --> 36:55.463
as the ramblings of a madman,

36:56.255 --> 36:58.424
if there wasn't so much truth to them.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.928
We do all create versions of ourselves...

37:02.595 --> 37:05.890
to appear to be the curators
of our own stories,

37:06.515 --> 37:10.311
to appear to be in the driver's seat
of our own lives.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.605
We are the worst generation.

37:12.772 --> 37:14.023
We're all full of shit.

37:14.106 --> 37:16.567
You all pretend to lead
these perfect, happy lives

37:16.651 --> 37:19.278
when you know,
you're just as lonely as me.

37:19.528 --> 37:22.448
You're fucking fake.
You're fucking plastic.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.952
[Peter] But pretending...
doesn't make us plastic.

37:26.577 --> 37:27.995
Imagination...

37:28.412 --> 37:29.914
is what makes us human.

37:30.957 --> 37:35.127
It allows us to figure out
which version of ourselves fits best.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.212
Put you...

37:36.379 --> 37:39.507
-[Tanner] Alright, how's the service?
-[Kevin] Wow. It's a big venue.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.260
-[Tanner] We're gonna rock this.
-[Kevin] This is awesome!

37:43.344 --> 37:45.346
[horse neighing]

37:45.554 --> 37:47.556
[musical sound effects]

37:51.269 --> 37:55.898
[Peter] We're not the worst generation.
We're just the most exposed.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.193
We're living in a constant state
of feedback.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.279
[dance music playing]

38:01.445 --> 38:02.530
[Peter] And judgment.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.076
So maybe the masks are a tool
to survive the time.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.205
Maybe they provide a thin layer
of protection.

38:12.123 --> 38:13.416
A place to grow,

38:13.916 --> 38:14.834
discover,

38:15.668 --> 38:16.585
reinvent.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.754
[DeMarkus grunts]

38:18.838 --> 38:21.882
[Peter] The important part is having
people who know you...

38:22.091 --> 38:23.259
without the mask.

38:24.677 --> 38:26.804
And being happy with who you are...

38:27.888 --> 38:28.889
beneath it.

38:29.056 --> 38:31.726
[female robot voice]
Sorry, wrong number. Time to die.

38:35.730 --> 38:37.732
