WEBVTT

00:02.400 --> 00:04.756
Doctor, my baby girl
Hazel is sick.

00:04.760 --> 00:08.151
He said Kennedy shall be hung
by the neck until he be dead.

00:08.160 --> 00:10.436
Do you think your choices
will not haunt you?

00:10.440 --> 00:12.318
If you think
you'll intimidate me

00:12.320 --> 00:13.674
into dropping my bid,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.751
well, you're as stupid
as you are duplicitous!

00:15.760 --> 00:18.559
Lansing's out of control.
He must be contained.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.597
Is this official
police business, sir, or--

00:20.600 --> 00:23.593
What this is, Mr. Maguire,
is you showing appreciation

00:23.600 --> 00:25.114
for being saved
from the gallows!

00:25.120 --> 00:27.271
<i>- Missus Corcoran.
- I'm looking for Kevin.</i>

00:27.280 --> 00:30.273
Ellen stopped by today.
She's pregnant.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.636
You slept with my wife
again, you son of a bitch!

00:33.640 --> 00:35.279
The child is not mine,
Kevin.

00:37.000 --> 00:43.074

02:09.840 --> 02:12.912
I was waiting all night
for you to come to bed.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.680
You never did.

02:14.680 --> 02:17.559
I will sleep
when Kennedy's dead.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.074
Well, tonight the world
will be free of him.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.960
Amen.

02:24.640 --> 02:27.758
But first we must pay respects
to Kevin's wife.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.150
Mmm... yes.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.753
That poor woman.

02:33.080 --> 02:36.198
Such desperation
to go so far.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.996
Even in my darkest days...

02:39.920 --> 02:41.752
Who can say?

02:41.880 --> 02:44.076
But surely she did not
deserve to die,

02:44.680 --> 02:46.000
unlike Kennedy.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.513
Robert, I think
your presence there

02:50.520 --> 02:53.911
might be a victory
to him.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.033
I think perhaps...

02:56.960 --> 02:59.429
...It might be a waste
of your time.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.318
No, I want
to see it happen.

03:01.320 --> 03:03.755
I want to see Kennedy choke out
his last breath.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.353
What good
will seeing that do?

03:05.360 --> 03:09.274
It's how I will close the book
on the whole sordid affair.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.194
For father...

03:15.000 --> 03:16.719
...But mostly for you.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.039
I'm burying her
with my daughter.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.189
It's where she belongs.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.352
Kevin, you know
the Church's teachings.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.400
She committed
a mortal sin.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.960
The new archbishop would
never allow a burial

03:42.960 --> 03:43.950
on consecrated ground.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.314
Then don't tell him.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.640
It's not so easy,
son.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.233
Every interment goes through
his office.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.197
And this new fella,

03:50.200 --> 03:52.590
he's no Dagger John Hughes,
believe me.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.831
Hughes at least
appreciated loopholes.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.593
So the two of them
are forever apart.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.159
- I'm sorry--
- Mother and child?

03:58.160 --> 04:01.437
Kevin, I'd be banished
to Canarsie

04:01.440 --> 04:03.511
if I went against
the Church.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.276
All because of rules
made by man.

04:06.440 --> 04:11.560
Now if Ellen were to be
cremated...

04:11.680 --> 04:13.831
I thought that's another rule.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.878
The Church is
against cremation.

04:15.880 --> 04:21.716
And her ashes scattered
alongside Maggie's grave...

04:22.920 --> 04:24.559
In the dead of night...

04:24.640 --> 04:26.154
No one'd ever know.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.154
You have Dagger John's
affinity for loopholes.

04:33.640 --> 04:40.956
Faith depends on our belief
in the unknowable.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.956
Will you join me
in prayer?

04:44.960 --> 04:46.758
You go ahead, Father.

04:47.760 --> 04:49.114
I lost God
about nine minutes

04:49.160 --> 04:51.595
into The Battle
of the Wilderness.

04:57.040 --> 05:01.000
"To everything
there is a season,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.471
<i>and a time to every purpose
under the heaven."</i>

05:05.560 --> 05:08.871
<i>"a time to be born,
and a time to die...</i>

05:08.880 --> 05:09.870
<i>...a time to kill..."</i>

05:09.880 --> 05:14.875
"We urge- no, uh,
we demand that the Board of Aldermen

05:15.240 --> 05:18.074
select General Donovan's bid

05:18.080 --> 05:21.915
for the proposed
new Croton Aqueduct."

05:21.920 --> 05:23.912
We urge that
The Board of Aldermen

05:23.920 --> 05:26.719
acts with good sense
and alacrity...

05:27.680 --> 05:30.149
<i>...in approving
General Donovan's bid,</i>

05:30.160 --> 05:31.833
<i>et cetera, et cetera.</i>

05:34.840 --> 05:36.274
How long, Donovan?

05:36.280 --> 05:38.431
How long will I be
your pawn?

05:38.440 --> 05:40.272
Is that how you see
our collaboration?

05:40.280 --> 05:41.953
Oh, is that what
you call this,

05:41.960 --> 05:44.395
this blackmail operation
you're running,

05:44.400 --> 05:48.189
using me to secure your bid
for this foolishness?

05:48.200 --> 05:51.318
Would you rather the buccaneer
Lansing get the project?

05:51.320 --> 05:52.310
I would prefer neither.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.471
The Croton Aqueduct
is sufficient.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.269
And yet its most staunch
advocates agree that system

05:58.280 --> 06:01.079
will support a population
of no more than two million.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.275
And in what fantasy land...

06:02.280 --> 06:03.873
...will we need more water
than that?

06:05.280 --> 06:07.033
That's the problem with you
Anglo-Saxons,

06:07.040 --> 06:10.078
you lack a talent
for grandeur.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.400
Someday, Donovan,
I will simply refuse

06:11.400 --> 06:12.629
to do your bidding.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.111
Ah, I find
adjusting to the reality

06:16.120 --> 06:17.793
of one's station in life

06:17.800 --> 06:19.598
is like a balm
for the soul.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.913
I see our collaboration
as being mutually beneficial.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.310
You help me get
what I need,

06:27.320 --> 06:31.155
and I secure for you
that which you desire.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.640
Mister O'Hearn!

06:45.920 --> 06:48.389
The tenement well
Hazel used is located here.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.676
The water supply flowing
into it begins here,

06:50.680 --> 06:52.672
where Collect Pond
used to be.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.160
A well's water
is always a reflection

06:54.160 --> 06:55.674
of the history
of its source.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.751
What is the history
of Collect Pond?

06:57.760 --> 07:01.071
A dumping spot for tanneries,
slaughterhouses, cattle pens.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.639
A sewer would have
cleaner water.

07:13.680 --> 07:15.672
Oh, Kevin, come in.

07:25.080 --> 07:26.514
Sit down.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.515
Uh, Sara, I was uh...
hoping you could help me out.

07:33.240 --> 07:37.837
I need to...
to pick a dress for Ellen.

07:38.840 --> 07:42.311
Of course.
We'll choose a beautiful color.

07:43.320 --> 07:44.959
What was her favorite?

07:44.960 --> 07:48.078
Um...
I, I can't remember.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.399
I don't think
I ever knew.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.235
Mister Corcoran,
if it please you, stay here.

07:56.240 --> 07:58.197
Sara and I, we'll...

07:58.200 --> 08:01.272
...we'll get your Missus
ready for cooling.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.758
Back home,
I have readied the dead

08:03.760 --> 08:05.080
for the next life.

08:08.240 --> 08:10.675
<i>Excuse me, Robert.</i>

08:10.680 --> 08:11.670
I'm not staying.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.751
I just wanted to thank you
for the invitation

08:13.760 --> 08:15.877
to this evening's hanging.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.758
The invitation
didn't come from me.

08:18.880 --> 08:21.873
It arrived this morning
to the club.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.435
My wife remains
your ardent supporter.

08:25.440 --> 08:27.830
For all her
unfortunate instincts,

08:27.840 --> 08:30.753
she does sometimes
recognize what is right.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.638
Putting Kennedy's terror
to rest

08:32.640 --> 08:36.270
and trying to keep us
a family.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.794
I'm sorry for the things
I said about your mother.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.076
Truly sorry.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.070
For mother's sake alone

08:42.080 --> 08:44.390
I will attempt
to accept your apology.

08:44.400 --> 08:48.599
Just to be clear,
that gun was not loaded.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.958
I will see you
at the hanging.

08:57.080 --> 08:59.720
My fire's burnin' hot now!

08:59.720 --> 09:01.040
<i>Damn rebel!</i>

09:01.040 --> 09:02.440
<i>Huh?! Is that really
what you think?</i>

09:02.440 --> 09:04.796
Carrying on
like a loon in there.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.395
Jesus, Kennedy,
you're a bit touched!

09:07.400 --> 09:09.960
<i>I'll be home soon!</i>

09:14.960 --> 09:17.236
Sanity is for the unchained.

09:32.520 --> 09:35.752
Hey, Major, Missus,
come on in.

09:35.760 --> 09:40.755
<i>'Tis there I'd sit
and cry my fill</i>

09:40.800 --> 09:46.319
<i>And every tear
would turn a mill</i>

09:46.680 --> 09:53.029
<i>Is go dte
tu mo mhuirnin slan...</i>

09:54.400 --> 09:56.278
I don't think
I can find the words.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.476
Don't have to,
Matthew.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.235
You and I have been through
enough together.

10:05.240 --> 10:07.311
A few words
won't change that.

10:10.240 --> 10:12.550
Sara,
I can't thank you enough.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.359
She looks beautiful,
and at rest.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.635
<i>We were glad to do it.</i>

10:18.760 --> 10:22.470
She is at peace now...
with the Lord.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.194
Corky...

10:31.200 --> 10:33.760
Your Aunt Maeve is quite
an interesting woman.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.430
I was always terrified of her.

10:36.440 --> 10:38.830
She used to beat my cousin
with a wire belt.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.030
You certain there's nothing
I can arrange?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.838
More food, spirits?

10:44.840 --> 10:47.116
Railway ticket
out of town?

10:47.120 --> 10:49.760
Oh no, Major,
thank you.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.113
<i>My heart aches
for your grief, Kevin.</i>

11:01.880 --> 11:04.679
I hope you find solace
amidst the pain.

11:06.560 --> 11:10.759
I appreciate the two of you
making the trip,

11:11.760 --> 11:12.989
but I'm holding up.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.715
I hope I did not
upset him further.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.033
For all our differences,
Corky and I share one trait;

11:25.040 --> 11:28.078
we do not receive sympathy
with much grace.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.432
So that's an Irish wake.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.312
Mourning and drinking
and singing

11:34.320 --> 11:36.630
all rolled into one.

11:36.640 --> 11:38.632
I prefer the way
we do it.

11:38.640 --> 11:41.553
Somber affairs mark the somber
passing of somber lives.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.439
Somber or not,
these events remind us

11:44.440 --> 11:47.751
we only have limited time
on this earth, Robert.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.674
Seeing Kevin and Matthew
together

11:49.680 --> 11:51.831
reminded me of that.

11:51.840 --> 11:52.990
The war?

11:55.160 --> 11:56.594
No place like the battlefield

11:58.480 --> 12:01.439
to learn about
the fleeting nature of life.

12:02.760 --> 12:05.355
Every day, I wondered,
"Would I be next?"

12:06.640 --> 12:08.632
Oh my God.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.917
I can't even imagine.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.230
Until I accepted the truth
that was before me.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.596
The truth?

12:16.600 --> 12:20.196
I have no control,
nor will I ever.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.557
These nitwits...

12:30.880 --> 12:35.636
...think the drink, the opium,
to be a result of my soft life.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.990
What does it matter
what other people think?

12:41.200 --> 12:43.669
In truth, it's the opposite.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.310
They help soothe the agony
in my vanished leg

12:47.320 --> 12:49.312
and clawing in my gut.

12:51.800 --> 12:56.795
They keep the idea of
an alternative ending...

12:57.960 --> 12:59.553
...at bay.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.119
Oh, Robert...

13:02.280 --> 13:04.476
Amidst the chaos,

13:04.480 --> 13:07.120
I'm so glad we found
each other.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.755
Major General Dix
has asked me

13:16.760 --> 13:19.070
to come and witness
the preparations

13:19.080 --> 13:20.594
for the execution.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.553
I'll be back shortly.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.710
All the staff have gone
to the parade.

13:28.720 --> 13:33.715
I'm going to enjoy
the rare quiet.

13:33.920 --> 13:38.358
<i>When boyhood's
fire was in my blood</i>

13:38.360 --> 13:41.751
<i>I read of ancient freemen</i>

13:42.200 --> 13:46.080
<i>For Greece and Rome
who bravely led</i>

13:46.280 --> 13:50.160
<i>Three hundred men
and three men</i>

13:50.440 --> 13:54.798
<i>And then I prayed
I yet might see</i>

13:54.800 --> 13:58.680
<i>Our fetters rent in twain</i>

13:58.680 --> 14:01.991
<i>And Ireland,
long a province</i>

14:02.000 --> 14:06.836
<i>Be a nation once again!</i>

14:06.840 --> 14:10.993
<i>A nation once again</i>

14:15.240 --> 14:18.153
<i>And Ireland,
long a province</i>

14:24.320 --> 14:26.118
You foilin' my plan
of escape?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.190
Sounds like you have a saloon
on your hands.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.598
You plannin' on coming in

14:34.600 --> 14:37.957
or are you gonna hide out here
all day?

14:38.240 --> 14:39.993
Heard your people
consider it a bad omen

14:40.000 --> 14:43.072
for women in my condition
to attend.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.151
Ill tidings
for the baby.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.870
Since when does Eva Heissen
believe in old superstition?

14:59.360 --> 15:01.829
Just one breath
at a time...

15:01.840 --> 15:03.957
that's how we endure
these things.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.236
I'm sick of superstition.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.391
I'm tired of rules

15:08.400 --> 15:09.390
that don't consider
what it's like

15:09.400 --> 15:11.278
actually being
in this world.

15:11.280 --> 15:12.634
Kevin...

15:15.040 --> 15:18.078
I'm afraid I may have caused
your Ellen to worry.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.152
What do you mean?

15:22.240 --> 15:25.199
I encountered her on the street
the other day.

15:25.200 --> 15:29.035
She asked about my pregnancy,
asked about you.

15:29.040 --> 15:30.440
So?

15:31.480 --> 15:33.551
I may have inadvertently
given her the impression

15:33.560 --> 15:34.914
that you were the father.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.120
Well, how so?

15:39.240 --> 15:41.960
I can't be.
The timing's all off, right?

15:41.960 --> 15:43.235
Of course it is.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.711
But how could Ellen
know that?

15:47.720 --> 15:50.554
I could have assured her,
but I didn't.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.229
Well, sadly,
what we coulda done different,

15:55.240 --> 15:58.119
don't matter much now,
Eva.

16:02.480 --> 16:04.278
Have you got a name yet?

16:07.360 --> 16:10.478
I'm going back and forth.
Nothing German.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.553
A nice American name.

16:14.680 --> 16:15.796
Yeah.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.320
No sense in looking
to the past.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.837
Major General Dix,
I came to inquire

16:56.840 --> 16:58.513
about the details
of Kennedy's execution

16:58.520 --> 17:00.113
and now he's gone?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.999
The traitor escaped
and stabbed a guard.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.992
Soldiers and coppers
are scouring

17:05.000 --> 17:06.480
the Downtown area.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.319
I hope he's Downtown.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.990
What's the problem?
Can we not move any faster?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.993
It's the parade, sir.
I have no way around the crowd.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.560
Pull over.
I'll go by foot.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.279
Whoa!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.390
Within the bounds
of your precinct

17:58.400 --> 18:00.756
is an entire tenement
full of very sick people,

18:00.760 --> 18:01.910
Irish and black alike...

18:01.920 --> 18:03.832
in dire need
of blood transfusions.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.036
I can help them if I can find
healthy, fit donors!

18:06.040 --> 18:07.190
News headline:

18:07.200 --> 18:08.998
"People are sick and dying
in Five Points."

18:09.000 --> 18:10.957
Thank you for the update
on neighborhood affairs.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.838
Your younger patrolmen
are the best candidates.

18:12.840 --> 18:14.638
They are active
and of the right age.

18:16.360 --> 18:18.920
This police force
is not going to mix races

18:18.920 --> 18:21.116
in the name of magic!

18:21.120 --> 18:22.110
So a month ago

18:22.120 --> 18:23.600
I should have left
my black hands in my pockets

18:23.600 --> 18:25.432
and my science
in my own head?!

18:29.080 --> 18:32.676
I didn't have to walk
into a building under siege,

18:32.680 --> 18:34.273
risk my own well-being,

18:34.280 --> 18:36.476
or ask my wife to work
with me all night

18:36.480 --> 18:39.075
to help keep you alive!

18:39.080 --> 18:40.799
It's Saint Patrick's Day!

18:42.800 --> 18:44.120
I'm about a battalion
short of men

18:44.120 --> 18:45.839
needed to keep order!

18:49.080 --> 18:50.560
But a few of the lads

18:50.560 --> 18:53.120
may be available.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.032
Tell them to meet me
at the tenement on Leonard

18:55.040 --> 18:56.156
as soon as
they can get there.

19:04.200 --> 19:07.637
Isn't it amazing that Robert
and I can wear the same clothes?

19:07.640 --> 19:10.712
<i>I always considered him
a much smaller man.</i>

19:13.120 --> 19:15.840
Certainly not in
achievement or standing.

19:15.840 --> 19:17.194
I was gonna flee the city,

19:17.200 --> 19:21.991
but I thought I'd drop in
and invite you along with me.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.436
How thoughtful.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.352
Despite
your occasional cruelty,

19:27.360 --> 19:30.671
I hold friendly sentiments
toward ya.

19:30.680 --> 19:33.639
I hold nothing for you
but mockery, you fool!

19:35.000 --> 19:37.560
Well then...

19:37.560 --> 19:40.519
It's time I finally
changed your opinion.

19:42.440 --> 19:46.354
You will die today...
Try as you might.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.317
Oh, that's enough,
Missus Morehouse.

19:55.520 --> 19:56.670
No!

19:57.880 --> 20:01.271
You fight like a dirty
guttersnipe!

20:02.280 --> 20:04.875
It's arousin',
I must admit.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.031
But I will not hesitate
to end your life.

20:18.920 --> 20:22.470
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

20:24.880 --> 20:26.439
Wait, shh...

20:27.440 --> 20:29.432
Not here.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.911
The staff will be back
from the parade soon.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.560
I'll come with you,
but we must hurry.

20:35.200 --> 20:36.190
<i>You search the top one?</i>

20:36.200 --> 20:37.873
<i>- Yes, of course.
- The left side as well?</i>

20:37.880 --> 20:38.870
<i>There's nothing there!</i>

20:40.520 --> 20:41.510
<i>Maybe the notes
are tucked away.</i>

20:41.520 --> 20:42.954
<i>What about the other end?</i>

20:42.960 --> 20:44.076
I thought you said the money
was here.

20:44.080 --> 20:45.719
We can't travel
without resources.

20:45.720 --> 20:48.519
I told you, the Morehouse
men don't involve their women

20:48.520 --> 20:49.749
in money matters.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.792
Oh, forgive me.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.235
I didn't realize
we would have visitors.

20:55.240 --> 20:57.277
Elizabeth, did you offer
Mister Kennedy a drink?

20:57.280 --> 21:00.114
A brandy man,
if I remember correctly.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.356
You know, I would love
one last taste

21:05.360 --> 21:07.431
of the blessed
Morehouse stock.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.430
Dear, be a good wife

21:08.440 --> 21:11.239
and pour us men a drink,
would you?

21:11.760 --> 21:13.558
Or would you prefer
something stronger,

21:13.560 --> 21:14.596
my good man?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.751
<i>Thank you.
We've got to be going on soon.</i>

21:16.760 --> 21:19.320
I think a brandy
would be wonderful.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.880
<i>You always considered
yourself clever,</i>

21:21.880 --> 21:24.111
A clever man who can
manipulate and exploit,

21:24.120 --> 21:28.558
but unfortunately a firearm
is much more powerful

21:28.560 --> 21:30.438
<i>than a wealthy wiseass.</i>

21:30.440 --> 21:31.556
<i>Where's your money?!</i>

21:33.600 --> 21:36.479
Truthfully, I haven't seen
a silver piece in an age.

21:36.480 --> 21:38.756
When father left,
I found I was literate

21:38.760 --> 21:40.877
in all things but finance.

21:40.880 --> 21:42.234
Is that so?

21:42.240 --> 21:43.993
Argh!

21:47.360 --> 21:48.953
Your drinks, gentlemen.

21:53.040 --> 21:55.032
I do appreciate
your hospitality.

21:56.360 --> 21:58.238
Mmm...

21:58.240 --> 22:01.472
But, we've got to be off soon
and uh...

22:01.480 --> 22:04.234
Elizabeth has decided
to leave with me.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.230
Really?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.596
That's a revelation.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.592
So don't make me
ask you again

22:09.600 --> 22:11.671
or I will shoot you.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.593
Where is your
goddamn money?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.991
Maybe I have a few bob
stashed away.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.512
There.

22:28.520 --> 22:31.638
All the Morehouse notes
yet to be deposited.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.759
The key!

22:39.600 --> 22:41.637
Uh...

22:45.400 --> 22:47.631
Mmm...

22:53.800 --> 22:56.076
So clever...

22:56.080 --> 22:58.549
Always so clever.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.992
Robert! Are you okay?

23:04.000 --> 23:06.037
I'm okay.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.075
She is first mine.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.999
Ungh!

23:21.720 --> 23:25.953
You know the most frightened
I ever seen ya?

23:25.960 --> 23:28.236
Was you holdin' Maggie

23:28.240 --> 23:31.517
them first few days
after she was born.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.239
God...

23:33.240 --> 23:36.597
I was terrified of that
gorgeous little creature.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.319
Your whole body
go stiff.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.072
You looked like...

23:43.440 --> 23:44.840
...like that little babe
in your arms

23:44.840 --> 23:47.912
was plannin' to devour you
at any moment.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.593
It was nothing that
could have been expected

23:49.600 --> 23:52.195
or imagined.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.078
I've been meaning to say,
Kevin,

23:54.080 --> 23:56.470
she looks stunning,
your Ellen.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.073
Christ, Sybil.

23:58.080 --> 23:59.719
You promised
you weren't gonna say that.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.360
Shut up.
It's a free country.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.760
God forbid I should
say something nice.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.638
Every wake we ever been to,

24:05.640 --> 24:07.597
whether the departed
is eight or 80,

24:07.600 --> 24:09.717
"Ah, they look
beautiful, they do."

24:09.720 --> 24:11.393
- She goes on and on.
- Well, she does.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.800
She's dead, Sybil.

24:13.800 --> 24:14.995
How the hell can you
be good lookin'

24:15.000 --> 24:16.036
when you're dead?

24:16.040 --> 24:17.030
Keep it up

24:17.040 --> 24:19.475
and they'll be building
a box for you right quick.

24:19.480 --> 24:20.675
You remember
Bridey O'Halloran?

24:20.680 --> 24:21.636
Oh...

24:21.640 --> 24:23.791
Bridey O'Halloran.
You remember Bridey O'Halloran?

24:23.800 --> 24:25.632
She had some mug
on her.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.757
She was as ugly a witch
as ever walked the earth.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.672
It's bad luck
to disrespect the dead!

24:29.680 --> 24:31.034
<i>We go to the wake,</i>

24:31.040 --> 24:33.430
and this one's saying
to Mister O'Halloran

24:33.440 --> 24:35.955
"Ah, she looks
lovely in the box, she does."

24:37.640 --> 24:39.836
<i>The dead are just dead, okay?</i>

24:39.840 --> 24:40.910
They're neither
good lookin' or not,

24:40.920 --> 24:42.320
'cause it don't matter.

24:42.320 --> 24:44.596
Oh, stick it, you big oaf!

24:46.320 --> 24:47.800
Sorry.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.871
Hey, at least now
it's a proper wake.

25:01.880 --> 25:02.870
So what's next?

25:02.880 --> 25:05.873
We start swinging from the trees
and craving bananas?

25:08.520 --> 25:11.718
And what do they call
you Irish but savages?

25:11.720 --> 25:13.552
You talk to a copper
like that?!

25:16.000 --> 25:19.755
I apologize, sir.
I was out of line.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.830
- Momma!
<i>- You know what?</i>

25:20.840 --> 25:22.593
To hell with Sullivan's
crack orders!

25:22.600 --> 25:24.478
Sara!

25:24.480 --> 25:27.075
Would you and Hattie mind
checking on the cart outside?

25:38.920 --> 25:41.480
Robert?

25:41.480 --> 25:43.312
Robert!

25:43.320 --> 25:44.913
You're not supposed
to be up there!

25:48.400 --> 25:50.278
True, but good God...

25:51.640 --> 25:53.632
Imagine if
you were found out.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.229
You might have been forced
up these steps.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.272
Come on, come up.

26:01.360 --> 26:04.194
No. No, I will not.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.316
And you don't have to keep
reminding me

26:05.320 --> 26:06.515
of my debt to you.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.789
Humor me.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.955
Oh my God.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.800
It really does give you
the chills, doesn't it?

26:52.320 --> 26:54.312
Annie Reilly.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.556
Where you been?

26:58.800 --> 27:00.154
Around.

27:02.240 --> 27:05.677
I um...
I heard about your Ellen.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.875
I'm so sorry.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.879
Well, thanks for coming.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.599
It means a lot to me.

27:15.640 --> 27:18.917
I have been planning
to come see you.

27:19.680 --> 27:22.514
I have found a nice family
to live with.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.920
Oh yeah?

27:25.200 --> 27:30.559
Well, is it, is it safe?
Are they kind?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.111
They are gentle.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.112
They own a farm
in Jersey,

27:36.120 --> 27:38.680
a place called
New Milford,

27:38.680 --> 27:42.196
on the banks
of the Hackensack river.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.476
For a little girl,
anything beats Five Points.

27:46.720 --> 27:51.112
I told them my name
was Annie Corcoran;

27:51.280 --> 27:53.840
that my father
is a New York City detective.

27:54.680 --> 27:56.672
Is that okay?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.433
Of course it is, child.

27:59.960 --> 28:03.351
You promise me
you'll be careful, Annie.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.194
Annie Corcoran.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.119
And bring me back
some country chickens

28:10.120 --> 28:11.315
now and again.

28:20.880 --> 28:23.873
Now eat before you stand.
Get your strength back.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.837
Transfusion is working.

28:30.920 --> 28:33.435
Everyone seems to be
responding well.

28:33.720 --> 28:35.552
Matthew, come here!

28:36.440 --> 28:39.638
Breathe...
Breathe for me, baby.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.634
Hazel, honey,
breathe for me!

28:43.160 --> 28:45.629
I believed in you!
I trusted you!

28:46.560 --> 28:48.552
She was fine.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.438
She was getting
stronger.

28:50.440 --> 28:52.318
Let Matthew tend
to this girl.

28:52.320 --> 28:54.073
What the hell is goin' on?

28:57.280 --> 28:58.475
I told you this fool
was no better

28:58.480 --> 29:00.278
than some cracker doctor.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.794
You don't give
a damn about us!

29:05.880 --> 29:07.473
Go on now.
This party's over!

29:08.280 --> 29:09.270
Leave us be,
damn it!

29:09.280 --> 29:12.193
Matthew, time to go.

29:42.680 --> 29:46.879
I am what I heal.
Today I am nothing.

29:49.720 --> 29:53.600
Many of those patients were
beyond the reach of medicine,

29:54.000 --> 29:57.038
and some still you saved.

30:00.280 --> 30:04.399
Think on the last time
we were together in Virginia.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.876
For months
we planned escape,

30:09.680 --> 30:11.592
but it didn't work out.

30:12.880 --> 30:17.477
Yet here we are,
years later, together.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.839
You do what you can.
The rest is up to God.

30:24.280 --> 30:25.270
I may have faith,

30:25.280 --> 30:28.193
but too much dependence
on God is...

30:28.200 --> 30:30.032
...only for the helpless,

30:30.400 --> 30:32.278
and I can solve
this problem.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.079
Even with all your learning,
Matthew,

30:35.080 --> 30:38.630
you are not the answer
to the world's troubles.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.871
<i>No man is.</i>

30:41.880 --> 30:46.352
The world will know the loss
of Hazel Turnow.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.717
And it will not lose
one more like her.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.519
You must be blessed
with an abundance of luck,

31:02.960 --> 31:05.111
what with
Alderman Bartlett

31:05.120 --> 31:07.555
<i>strangled to death
with his pants down,</i>

31:08.400 --> 31:12.394
the most vocal opponent
of your Aqueduct bid and of you,

31:12.840 --> 31:14.832
meeting such a sordid end.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.357
Ah, the poor man.

31:18.360 --> 31:21.114
I offered up
a rosary for him,

31:21.120 --> 31:22.873
past Sunday mass.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.076
Please, it's more likely
you danced a jig

31:25.080 --> 31:26.912
over his demise.

31:27.360 --> 31:30.637
I don't tend to gloat,
but I do like to win.

31:32.680 --> 31:33.670
You have been winning

31:33.680 --> 31:35.399
since you got
to these shores.

31:35.400 --> 31:37.790
But I have to ask...

31:37.800 --> 31:40.269
No rich daddy back home?

31:40.280 --> 31:44.638
Nobody to stake you
in the new world?

31:44.640 --> 31:45.915
I was one of 14 children

31:45.920 --> 31:47.912
raised in
a mud-floored hut

31:47.920 --> 31:50.719
outside of Sneem
in the county of Kerry.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.279
Need I do the math
for you?

31:52.280 --> 31:53.953
<i>You're a keen operator,
Donovan.</i>

31:53.960 --> 31:55.679
But even with Bartlett gone,

31:55.680 --> 31:58.639
you will not get
the Aqueduct project

31:58.640 --> 32:01.553
unless you get Lansing
to withdraw his bid.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.473
I believe my proposal
will win the day,

32:04.480 --> 32:06.915
and you and I will profit

32:06.920 --> 32:09.480
as the properties we share
will explode in value.

32:10.520 --> 32:12.830
So far he has refused.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.312
What makes you
so certain

32:16.320 --> 32:18.915
he will come around
to your position?

32:18.920 --> 32:21.037
I'm sure that you
will see that

32:21.040 --> 32:23.999
chief among my greatest traits
is flexibility.

32:24.000 --> 32:27.391
I can adjust
my negotiation style...

32:27.400 --> 32:29.039
...if required.

32:34.040 --> 32:36.191
Who's that?

32:39.160 --> 32:41.197
I'm the Angel of Darkness,
you orange bastard.

32:41.320 --> 32:42.595
Help! Sheehan!

32:42.600 --> 32:44.114
Shh, shh, shh...

32:44.520 --> 32:46.591
It's a Catholic holiday.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.917
All your staff are down
at Eva's Paradise...

32:49.080 --> 32:49.911
Kerosene?

32:50.080 --> 32:52.993
<i>...Spending Donovan's money
on whores and whiskey.</i>

32:53.000 --> 32:54.832
You got two choices.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.795
You can sign this paper now...

32:59.480 --> 33:03.713
...or I turn you into
a flaming scarecrow.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.396
What is this?

33:12.400 --> 33:14.312
I'm not paid to know
or care.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.551
You really think you clowns
will get away with this?

33:16.560 --> 33:18.313
If I'm a clown...

33:18.760 --> 33:20.433
...then there's only
one choice for you.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.635
No.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.552
Please, spare me!

33:26.040 --> 33:28.191
Please, God in heaven,
put that match out!

33:28.200 --> 33:30.795
<i>Look, you bastards have won!
Please!</i>

33:30.800 --> 33:32.917
I don't want to die.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.396
Jesus, you're embarrassing me,
Lansing.

33:35.400 --> 33:36.516
<i>Now sign.</i>

33:50.400 --> 33:52.039
Happy Saint Patrick's Day.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.033
I have never seen
such poor white folks...

34:11.040 --> 34:12.679
...just wretched.

34:15.360 --> 34:16.635
They're living worse
than half the slaves

34:16.639 --> 34:18.518
I ever knew.

34:19.400 --> 34:20.914
At least they are free.

34:21.360 --> 34:23.112
Free to do what?

34:24.639 --> 34:27.360
Live like some kind
of sick animals,

34:27.840 --> 34:29.991
unable to fend
for themselves?

34:30.480 --> 34:33.234
Most of 'em,
the Irish especially,

34:33.239 --> 34:34.435
arrived here
with nothing,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.877
so they are forced to fight
for the scraps.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.871
I'm not trying
to defend whites

34:39.880 --> 34:43.840
who see fit to own people
as property, but...

34:45.080 --> 34:47.639
...in my experience,
at least they had manners.

34:47.639 --> 34:48.915
Momma!

34:49.199 --> 34:52.193
So long as you say
thank you and please

34:52.199 --> 34:53.714
and know what fork
to use first

34:53.719 --> 34:55.313
you are a good person?

34:55.320 --> 34:58.040
Do not try to change
what I'm saying.

35:00.560 --> 35:02.870
Just...civilized.

35:02.880 --> 35:06.032
Well, we're equals here,
at least by law,

35:06.040 --> 35:08.077
and we are carving out a life
for ourselves and--

35:08.080 --> 35:09.400
A life?

35:10.560 --> 35:11.550
Here?!

35:13.080 --> 35:18.075
Life has space, Sara,
and sky and...

35:18.760 --> 35:19.750
...privacy.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.759
Clean air to breathe.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.716
On the plantation,
the only privacy we had

35:26.720 --> 35:28.916
was what daddy
wanted to give us.

35:30.600 --> 35:32.910
Here it's whatever
we can take,

35:33.080 --> 35:34.434
for ourselves.

35:38.320 --> 35:40.596
I don't aim to be ungrateful.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.634
I'm just...

35:46.320 --> 35:50.439
...not accustomed
to your Five Points.

35:59.760 --> 36:03.197
You uh...
You don't have to go, Annie.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.190
I do.

36:04.200 --> 36:06.669
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm sorry, Kevin.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.990
It wasn't your fault.

36:10.280 --> 36:13.478
We were broken...
long before you got here.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.160
I just wish that....

36:18.400 --> 36:21.074
How many wishes
do each of us have?

36:23.880 --> 36:26.600
Some get more than others,
I guess.

36:28.160 --> 36:32.074
I was telling the story
the other day,

36:32.200 --> 36:34.157
on how you took me
to Central Park

36:34.160 --> 36:35.640
and we went sleigh riding.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.438
Yeah,
that was a fun day.

36:37.840 --> 36:39.559
Even your Ellen
had fun.

36:39.640 --> 36:40.960
She was happy.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.519
I wish that...

36:47.960 --> 36:50.156
...we could all have had
more days like that.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.880
Ever since a copper
offered me an egg,

36:53.560 --> 36:56.519
I have learned
to have good days.

37:09.000 --> 37:12.198
Thank you
for never giving up on me.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.669
I am always so proud of you.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.955
Matthew is just wastin'
his time.

37:44.960 --> 37:49.955
He is changing lives,
saving lives.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.589
I know you have been free
for a while,

37:52.600 --> 37:55.240
but I cannot believe
that any white man

37:55.240 --> 37:56.594
is gonna care
about the words

37:56.600 --> 37:58.080
he's putting down
on that paper.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.594
That is a strong possibility.

37:59.600 --> 38:02.069
But not putting
those words down

38:02.080 --> 38:05.073
guarantees that no man,
white or black,

38:05.080 --> 38:06.560
will ever read them.

38:42.760 --> 38:46.754
You tell my friends
these last words!

38:48.840 --> 38:52.277
I am to hang,
and you are my brothers,

38:54.320 --> 38:57.597
and I happily die for you,
for my country.

38:59.480 --> 39:04.680
And I am not sorry
and I am not afraid.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.115
It's better this be my fate

39:08.120 --> 39:11.477
than fall on bended knee
to the Union!

39:17.720 --> 39:21.919
<i>Trust to luck,
trust to luck</i>

39:25.080 --> 39:29.552
<i>Stare fate in the face.</i>

39:31.440 --> 39:36.720
<i>For your heart
will be easy</i>

39:38.520 --> 39:43.151
<i>When it's in the right place</i>

40:52.280 --> 40:54.749
<i>I'm not gonna lie to ya, Kevin,</i>

40:54.920 --> 40:57.071
and you can do
what you like to me.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.197
You can shoot me through
the head or the heart.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.714
Don't tempt me.

41:05.080 --> 41:06.912
But I loved Ellen.

41:06.920 --> 41:08.832
<i>Maybe not as much as you,</i>

41:09.160 --> 41:11.629
maybe in a different way,

41:14.120 --> 41:15.474
but I did.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.439
I still do.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.316
And I love you too,
ya bastard,

41:24.640 --> 41:27.155
<i>more than any brother
I ever could have had.</i>

41:29.760 --> 41:34.437
<i>I know I done things
that can't be forgiven.</i>

41:37.840 --> 41:39.752
But just remember,

41:39.760 --> 41:42.958
I will kill or die for you
any day of the week.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.156
All you need to do is ask.

41:52.160 --> 41:54.231
I know, Francis.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.070
Do you realize that...

42:03.800 --> 42:06.076
...on Saint Patrick's Day,

42:06.480 --> 42:08.233
we celebrate the day
he died?

42:16.120 --> 42:18.555
When I was a boy,
I always assumed...

42:19.160 --> 42:20.913
<i>...we were drinking
to his birth.</i>

42:20.920 --> 42:22.673
I was never that hopeful.

42:43.200 --> 42:48.320
<i>Our ship she's ready
to sail away</i>

42:50.360 --> 42:52.511
<i>And it's come
my sweet comrades</i>

42:52.520 --> 42:55.035
<i>O'er the stormy sea...</i>

42:56.040 --> 43:01.035
<i>Her snow white wings
are all unfurled</i>

43:01.280 --> 43:05.115
<i>And soon we'll swim
in a watery world.</i>
