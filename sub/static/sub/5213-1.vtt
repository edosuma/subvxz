01:10.111 --> 01:12.946
This is the future.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.159
The world as we know it is gone.

01:18.578 --> 01:22.581
Acid rain has left the land barren,
and the water toxic.

01:23.625 --> 01:29.129
Scared by endless wars, humanity struggles
to survive in the ruins of the old world.

01:30.006 --> 01:34.802
Frozen in an everlasting nuclear winter,
this is the future.

01:35.386 --> 01:38.222
This is the year 1997.

05:14.605 --> 05:18.025
Turbo Blast!

06:53.121 --> 06:55.038
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah! Come on.

07:17.520 --> 07:18.937
Kid!

07:19.021 --> 07:22.607
Hey, oh, man, it's been a long time.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.359
How you been, huh?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.111
OK.

07:29.949 --> 07:33.743
A vicious whore bit me, right smack
in the middle of my nut-sack.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.454
That shit ever happen to you?

07:36.831 --> 07:38.373
Hey, what happened?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.333
Who did that?

07:41.085 --> 07:42.377
It was the rat.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.839
That rat did that?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.384
It was a vicious rat.

07:50.219 --> 07:54.264
You know, it's a goddamn miracle
that you're still surviving on your own.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.725
Well, how about a drink?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.060
Uh, no thank you.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.437
Suit yourself.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.588
Are you gonna play nice, Mr Bird?

08:27.548 --> 08:30.717
Huh? Are you gonna play nice?

08:30.927 --> 08:32.552
OK.

08:32.636 --> 08:33.886
OK.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.599
The drinks are on you.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.559
- Yeah.
- Aha-ha.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.020
Huh, still undefeated.

08:43.773 --> 08:44.981
So, what else you got?

08:45.566 --> 08:48.568
Oh, um...

08:55.576 --> 08:58.370
Well for this junk, I, uh,
can give you the usual.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.164
Hmm?

09:07.505 --> 09:09.673
Let me give you a couple
of these too on credit.

09:12.343 --> 09:13.635
Looks worse than ever.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.471
Well, if you feel like
complaining some more,

09:16.556 --> 09:19.599
you're more than welcome to lap up
whatever's on the floor.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.771
This sucks.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.231
Hey!

09:26.315 --> 09:28.525
Keep pedalling, you piece of shit.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.196
Unbelievable.

09:37.743 --> 09:44.249
Or I could always, uh, toss this in
for good measure, hmm?

10:03.269 --> 10:05.186
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Huh?

10:06.230 --> 10:08.523
You can't just walk
into a man's personal bubble.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.484
His what?

10:11.986 --> 10:15.196
A man's personal space,
the arm-length radius, yeah?

10:15.906 --> 10:19.659
My mother-fucking-comfort-zone,
and it's family only.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.036
Sir?

10:23.664 --> 10:25.624
Can't you see I'm in
the middle of something here?

10:25.875 --> 10:28.001
- Another one's gone missing.
- Who?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.253
I haven't got all day.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.922
Are you going to tell me who it is,
or am I gonna beat it out of you?

10:33.007 --> 10:34.174
It's your brother.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.302
Fuck!

10:38.220 --> 10:39.304
Let's roll!

10:40.014 --> 10:42.223
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Move it.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.054
Outstanding performance!

11:22.973 --> 11:25.725
Your infamous brother would be proud.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.311
Do you have any last requests?

11:31.065 --> 11:34.651
Hmm, try not to see this as punishment

11:34.735 --> 11:40.865
but rather an opportunity to prove
your usefulness in these difficult times.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.216
"Your reign of justice
is over, Turbo Rider,

11:58.300 --> 12:01.428
"but to be a true hero,
you'll have to save your girlfriend."

12:02.388 --> 12:03.888
"Save me, Turbo Rider."

12:04.432 --> 12:06.349
"Your evil plan will fail, Dr Robotor."

12:06.517 --> 12:10.603
"I will destroy you with my Turbo Glove,
the ultimate weapon against the robot threat."

12:12.106 --> 12:15.900
"But I am no ordinary robot,
I am a secret weapon.

12:21.407 --> 12:27.245
"Prepare to taste
a full turbo charge of..." Um...

12:27.329 --> 12:28.455
Hey!

12:31.125 --> 12:32.375
What's that in your hand?

12:33.669 --> 12:37.213
It's, um, it's a comic book.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.465
What's it about?

12:38.966 --> 12:40.550
It's about Turbo Rider?

12:40.634 --> 12:43.052
That's rad.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.389
Are you alone?

12:46.682 --> 12:47.974
Do you have any friends?

12:48.058 --> 12:49.809
Oh, do you want to play hide and seek?

12:51.270 --> 12:55.190
- I, um, I gotta go.
- Wait!

12:56.317 --> 12:58.357
Before we go,
I just have to take care of something.

13:04.366 --> 13:07.410
It's OK, now. You don't have to worry
about me any more.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.246
I found a new friend.
I'll be fine I promise.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.090
Um... Hmm.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.576
Sir, sir?

14:29.702 --> 14:33.830
I've been thinking. I don't know,
do you think it'd be a better idea

14:33.914 --> 14:38.710
to keep looking for the water source,
instead of, you know, fighting Zeus?

14:38.794 --> 14:41.254
Are you saying we should
abandon my brother?

14:41.338 --> 14:47.176
No. No. No, but I mean,
do you really think we stand a chance?

14:47.261 --> 14:49.262
Chance? Is that how you think
I became a champion?

14:49.722 --> 14:52.807
A man with a good plan
has already won half the battle.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.475
So what is the plan?

14:54.560 --> 14:57.687
Right now, the plan is to take a piss.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.796
Who needs chance anyways?

15:36.435 --> 15:37.852
What a cheap move.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.858
How'd I know that was gonna be you?

16:02.711 --> 16:04.751
Soon you'll have to learn
how to fix it by yourself.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.553
Here you go.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.593
- Good morning!
- Whoa!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.556
What are you doing here?

16:57.599 --> 16:58.808
Breakfast.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.357
Wow, where did you find all this stuff?

17:07.067 --> 17:09.986
Look at all these!

17:11.530 --> 17:13.781
It's like a museum of coolness in here.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.040
Oh, I love these, and the mixed colours.

17:22.290 --> 17:24.625
Look at that dress.
I love the colour of that dress.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.752
It's so nice. Oh, my God.

17:25.836 --> 17:28.156
- There's so many little things...
- Hey! Don't touch that!

17:31.050 --> 17:32.050
Are you OK?

17:33.010 --> 17:35.470
Yeah, just, you know,

17:35.554 --> 17:40.433
- you stepped in my manly bubble, thing...
- Oh.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.185
Did I break it?

17:43.687 --> 17:47.356
No, it's more of a, um,

17:47.441 --> 17:53.654
an arm length, um, comfort radius zone, OK?

17:54.114 --> 17:55.448
Oh, I see.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.328
- How did you find me?
- Oh, it's the bracelet.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.706
Oh, great. Well,

18:04.750 --> 18:06.042
how do you get it off?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.627
Oh, you just don't.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.463
Sit.

18:10.547 --> 18:12.507
Eat your cereal before it gets all mushy.

18:21.266 --> 18:25.478
- OK, how do I know you didn't poison this?
- Well, because, friends don't poison friends.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.314
No, no, OK. We are not friends.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.024
OK? I don't even know who you are.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.859
We met at the playground.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.529
Yeah,
but you broke into my home.

18:34.613 --> 18:38.116
You touched my things...

18:39.576 --> 18:41.160
And you talk to dead people.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.830
And I brought you back
your Turbo Rider comic book.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.378
Well, OK, you know,

18:50.462 --> 18:52.338
I thought you would want to hang out,

18:52.422 --> 18:56.551
- but you know, if you want me to go, then...
- Wait!

18:57.302 --> 19:01.055
OK, you can, you can stay.
But just for a while.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.515
My name's Apple.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.476
Of course it is.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.859
What are we going to do today?

19:13.485 --> 19:17.822
- I am going scavenging.
- Rad. I love scavenging.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.575
No, no, no! You, hmm, you stay here.

19:21.368 --> 19:23.953
Just don't touch anything.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.664
Well, why can't I come?

19:26.748 --> 19:30.459
Um, well, because...

19:32.296 --> 19:33.629
Because you don't have a bike.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.101
We are going scavenging.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.228
Yes!

19:51.148 --> 19:52.773
I love scavenging.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.069
OK.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.957
You were right!

20:10.250 --> 20:13.127
Your manly bubble is really comfortable!

20:17.216 --> 20:18.633
OK, we need to talk.

20:20.469 --> 20:24.055
OK, if you're coming with me, you need
to follow the survival rules of the wasteland.

20:24.139 --> 20:26.682
OK! I love rules!

20:26.767 --> 20:30.186
OK, rule number one,
always have water on you.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.437
Water, check.

20:33.315 --> 20:37.818
And, rule two,
always stay within the safe zone.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.654
Ooh, that's clever.

20:41.782 --> 20:42.949
Thank you.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.369
Rule number three,
always have your wheels ready.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.870
Have your wheels ready.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.958
- Um...
- Oh.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.961
Yee-ha!

21:08.100 --> 21:12.270
Number four, try avoiding people,
especially those who look evil.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.730
Well, I'm happy you
didn't avoid me.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.399
Like I had a choice.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.920
So you're Frederick, the arm wrestler.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.632
You have an eye for the obvious, Zeus.

21:42.259 --> 21:46.804
Uh, you know it's wonderful to finally
put a face to the name,

21:48.140 --> 21:50.391
and an honour to have you here.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.021
You can shove that honour up your arse.

21:56.648 --> 21:59.358
Now, what the hell
have you done with my brother?

21:59.443 --> 22:01.986
Patience my good man, patience.

22:02.070 --> 22:05.614
Now, your way of settling things,
I find a bit tedious.

22:05.699 --> 22:09.368
Around here we like to do things
with a little more joie de vivre.

22:11.580 --> 22:14.874
Blades, that's a nice touch.

22:16.293 --> 22:20.546
And there's more, blades and fire!

22:20.714 --> 22:22.131
Haa!

22:32.934 --> 22:38.981
When I say blades and fire,
I want blades and fire.

22:39.691 --> 22:41.067
Do you mind?

22:43.487 --> 22:44.904
No, go ahead.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.241
Thank you.

22:52.412 --> 22:57.249
Just because civilisation is over,
doesn't mean we can't act civilised.

22:57.834 --> 23:01.921
Well, what do you say we see
what the man has to offer, huh?

23:03.924 --> 23:08.928
All right, Zeus, but you won't like
what you see.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.442
You think I didn't see that coming?

23:23.610 --> 23:25.361
I have eyes everywhere.

23:25.445 --> 23:27.655
From where I stand, I only see one.

23:33.995 --> 23:37.123
Mother fucker!

23:39.793 --> 23:42.294
I'm going to kill you with my bare hands.

23:42.379 --> 23:45.506
Well, from where I stand, I only see one.

23:52.139 --> 23:55.474
Rule number five, no hugging while riding.

23:55.976 --> 23:57.601
I'm sorry.

23:57.686 --> 24:02.064
OK, now we really need to find you a bike,
and maybe a helmet.

24:28.842 --> 24:30.509
- Rule number five...
- Six.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.805
- Rule number six...
- Yes.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.017
Always carry a weapon.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.732
And seven, if you don't have one, make one.

24:45.442 --> 24:46.692
Make one.

24:47.694 --> 24:50.070
Making a weapon...

24:53.033 --> 24:54.492
Ah.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.965
This is so pretty.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.472
This is my weapon.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.392
This is my gnome stick.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.566
I really like it a lot, thank you so much.

25:30.362 --> 25:35.241
Pew, poo, poo, poo in the eye,
you're not part of it. Argh!

25:35.408 --> 25:36.951
Yeah, that's right.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.166
Boom! Pow! Gnome!

25:44.251 --> 25:46.168
Boom! Kabam!

25:46.253 --> 25:48.546
Pooh! Nah I told you, get back here!

25:56.429 --> 25:58.973
- Don't you ever rest?
- No.

26:00.100 --> 26:01.976
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.062
What are you doing here?

26:06.648 --> 26:08.107
I'm practising my swing.

26:10.819 --> 26:14.113
I mean, how did you get here,
this side of the wasteland?

26:14.864 --> 26:18.742
Well, my last best friend
was a water hunter, so I tagged along.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.370
Then he died, and here we are.

26:23.623 --> 26:25.374
I'm sorry.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.625
Why, what'd you do?

26:26.710 --> 26:29.378
No, no. I mean, about your friend.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.630
Oh, no, don't be, he's dead.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.304
So, where do you come from?

26:38.388 --> 26:41.765
Pretty far, all the way
from the other side of the wasteland.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.603
I always wondered
what the other side looked like.

26:45.687 --> 26:51.442
It's kind of grey and dusty.
Well, I could show you.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.987
I can't.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.573
Oh yeah, rule number two...

26:58.950 --> 27:03.078
Well, that's too bad,
that's too bad because you're "It"!

27:03.496 --> 27:04.622
Hah!

27:04.706 --> 27:06.040
- What?
- You're "It", I tagged you!

27:06.124 --> 27:09.168
Now, you gotta tag me back, if you can!

27:09.294 --> 27:10.461
Hah!

27:15.258 --> 27:16.967
- Oh, look at the bird...
- Where?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.224
You're friggin' fast.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.200
Wanna see something cool?

27:42.118 --> 27:43.786
I always want to see something cool.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.538
Come on.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.558
Whoa, that's a T-Rex.

28:07.310 --> 28:12.898
Yeah, they were these, um, big creatures
that used to walk the earth a long time ago.

28:13.733 --> 28:15.818
And they got killed off
by this big explosion.

28:15.902 --> 28:18.862
It's kind of like what happened to us,

28:21.825 --> 28:23.200
you know?

28:39.926 --> 28:42.010
Run! Run! Run!

31:15.748 --> 31:19.835
As you may know,
the situation is critical.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.421
Our defence grid has been breached.

31:23.339 --> 31:26.550
We have reached maximum casualty level.

31:27.427 --> 31:28.802
This is it soldier.

31:31.180 --> 31:34.641
We have to hit these damn
machines with everything we've got.

31:37.353 --> 31:41.064
You are our last hope.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.443
Turbo Rider.

31:48.948 --> 31:52.242
The fate of our future
is in your hand.

33:24.919 --> 33:26.169
Where is she?

33:51.654 --> 33:53.030
I'm coming, Apple.

35:15.238 --> 35:20.534
My beloved followers, we have a very
special guest with us here this evening.

35:21.911 --> 35:27.624
May I introduce Frederick,
the one-handed arm wrestler.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.795
Now, Frederick wishes to be reunited
with his loving brother.

35:32.463 --> 35:36.508
We all know how generous of spirit I am,
and I'm going to grant him his wish.

35:38.427 --> 35:41.471
I bet you're wondering
what this contraption is, hmm?

35:41.848 --> 35:44.766
You like science? I absolutely love it.

35:44.851 --> 35:49.020
For example, do you know how much water
there is in the average human body?

35:53.442 --> 35:57.362
Your blood is 83% water,
your muscle tissue, 75%.

35:57.446 --> 36:01.158
The gristle and cartilage
around your bones, 55%.

36:01.242 --> 36:03.910
The bones themselves, 25%.

36:04.036 --> 36:08.415
And your noggin up here,
the old grey matter is 90% water.

36:08.499 --> 36:13.879
Which brings the grand total
to ten precious gallons of H2O.

36:15.173 --> 36:20.594
Ten gallons, which this machine
is designed to extract.

36:21.512 --> 36:26.099
- I hope you choke on it, you mother fucker!
- Ah, ha-ha.

36:28.227 --> 36:32.814
My beloved followers, who keeps you safe?

36:33.107 --> 36:34.149
Zeus!

36:34.233 --> 36:35.984
Who quenches your thirst?

36:36.068 --> 36:37.152
Zeus!

36:37.236 --> 36:39.196
And who keeps you bloody entertained?

36:39.280 --> 36:40.363
Zeus!

36:40.448 --> 36:43.450
You see?
I'm not nearly as despicable as you think.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.245
- Let the juicing begin.
- No!

36:50.625 --> 36:52.751
I beg your pardon,
did somebody say something?

36:57.256 --> 36:59.466
Did somebody say something?

37:09.435 --> 37:10.727
Release the girl!

37:13.272 --> 37:15.607
And who exactly are you supposed to be?

37:18.903 --> 37:20.528
I'm a super hero.

37:24.784 --> 37:28.161
And what exactly is your super power?

37:31.123 --> 37:34.501
I said, what is your super power?

37:34.585 --> 37:37.671
This.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.512
Oh, come on, son. Give it your best shot.

37:47.932 --> 37:51.059
Well, that's rather disappointing, isn't it?

37:52.186 --> 37:53.687
Into the pool with him!

37:53.771 --> 37:55.105
In the pool!

38:08.202 --> 38:09.869
Whoa! Oh!

38:10.621 --> 38:12.872
I'm so happy to see you.

38:16.168 --> 38:18.211
Oh, I, uh, I brought you something.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.380
I brought this back for you.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.717
You're the best.

38:26.178 --> 38:28.221
A reunion, how sweet.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.566
You know, I'm real happy for you kids, I am.

38:30.850 --> 38:34.436
But unless we all want to end up in that giant
fucking blender over there, we need a plan.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.521
OK so listen up. I'm going to take
the fat one,

38:36.605 --> 38:38.125
he might be strong, but he'll be slow.

38:38.190 --> 38:40.750
You take the big guy.
Yeah, you're going to have to surprise him.

38:40.860 --> 38:42.736
You two take the ugly one, OK?

38:42.820 --> 38:44.821
What's the matter, kid, huh?
Are you scared?

38:46.282 --> 38:50.702
- Yeah.
- Fear is good, use it as a weapon. Yeah?

38:51.203 --> 38:52.871
Now, girl what is that thing, a dwarf?

38:53.581 --> 38:54.956
No, that's my gnome stick!

38:55.041 --> 38:56.791
OK, whatever.
I want you to swing it as hard

38:56.876 --> 38:58.168
as you can at that mother fucker's face.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.461
- Yeah?
- Sir, yes sir!

38:59.545 --> 39:01.296
Huh?

39:03.299 --> 39:06.217
Feel the wrath of Mr Gnome.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.471
Can you feel it?

39:09.555 --> 39:11.306
The wrath of Mr Gnome!

39:11.390 --> 39:12.766
I guess that was our cue.

39:39.752 --> 39:41.711
You fat fuck, you're fast.

39:46.008 --> 39:47.467
Apple.

40:22.753 --> 40:25.630
Not so fast now are you, fat fuck?

41:02.751 --> 41:04.252
Bravo.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.966
I have to admit, I did not see that coming.

41:14.221 --> 41:17.015
We won. Let us go.

41:19.518 --> 41:21.269
That's not how it works, kid.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.188
You're changing the rules, are you, Zeus?

41:23.522 --> 41:25.482
It's my game, my rules.

41:27.902 --> 41:29.152
No!

41:29.236 --> 41:33.031
I admire your resolve, but in the end,
you're just a loser.

41:36.327 --> 41:37.994
Eh, put the kid down.

41:38.078 --> 41:39.245
Argh.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.747
Playtime's over, kid.

42:06.941 --> 42:11.319
Prepare to taste a turbo charge
of justice in the face!

42:11.570 --> 42:13.530
Watch out!

42:23.582 --> 42:27.835
Hey, kids, now would be
a good time to leave.

42:29.129 --> 42:30.588
Let's split up.

42:48.232 --> 42:49.566
Find them.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.526
Kill them.

42:51.610 --> 42:54.153
Bring me back their heads on pikes.

43:57.926 --> 43:59.636
Hey there, sleepy head.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.062
Where, uh, where are we?

44:10.522 --> 44:11.939
We're on a couch.

44:12.566 --> 44:14.942
Why? How?

44:15.027 --> 44:18.529
You got pretty beat up.
You came back to save me.

44:20.991 --> 44:22.367
That was really sweet of you.

44:26.538 --> 44:27.914
You look pretty good in that suit.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.041
- You think so?
- Hmm.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.503
I just wish I could have done more,
you know?

44:33.587 --> 44:36.547
I wish I could have been more like
the real Turbo Rider.

44:38.634 --> 44:40.134
Yeah, maybe you can't,

44:42.054 --> 44:45.890
but you could totally
be Turbo Kid.

44:48.644 --> 44:52.397
That man in the eye patch, it was him.

44:53.982 --> 44:56.984
I wish I could have stopped him,
I should have.

44:57.069 --> 45:00.196
- Instead, I let you get shot.
- Hmm.

45:08.664 --> 45:13.876
You're a robot.

45:24.221 --> 45:25.263
You're it!

45:47.911 --> 45:49.996
You're pretty human-like for a robot.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.290
I'm very high-tech.

45:55.627 --> 45:57.467
I thought all robots were
supposed to be evil.

45:58.756 --> 46:00.047
Depends on the model.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.050
Well, can you shoot

46:03.135 --> 46:04.719
laser beams out of your mouth?

46:04.803 --> 46:07.472
No, silly, I'm just a friendship...

46:11.977 --> 46:14.729
Apple? Apple?

46:15.898 --> 46:17.398
Apple?

46:20.152 --> 46:21.319
Are you all right?

46:22.488 --> 46:26.574
Yeah, my bioelectric
transmitter is damaged.

46:26.658 --> 46:28.785
- Does it hurt?
- Oh, no.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.995
I'm just losing some hearts.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.165
Hmm.

46:34.208 --> 46:36.292
What happens when you
have no more hearts?

46:36.376 --> 46:38.169
I'll shut down, for good.

46:39.171 --> 46:41.464
Shut down? You mean you'll die?

46:42.257 --> 46:45.968
Yeah, yeah I'll die.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.525
Oh.

47:05.572 --> 47:07.406
Holy shit!

47:09.868 --> 47:12.495
Kid? Look at you!

47:12.913 --> 47:16.290
Don't you think you're taking
this comic book shit too far, huh?

47:16.375 --> 47:17.500
Look, we need your help.

47:17.709 --> 47:20.002
No, no, no, no, no.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.380
I don't care what kind of
trouble you got yourself into,

47:22.965 --> 47:24.048
I'm not interested.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.175
Hey. Hey.

47:26.301 --> 47:27.635
Put that back.

47:27.719 --> 47:29.595
Looks like you got yourself
a girlfriend, hmm?

47:33.475 --> 47:35.351
Oh!

47:35.769 --> 47:37.854
Give me that back, young lady!

47:39.231 --> 47:40.565
Hey, what are you doing? You're leaving?

47:40.649 --> 47:43.484
Yes, and if I were you, I'd be packing too.

47:43.694 --> 47:45.778
Frederick The Arm-Wrestler is gone!

47:45.904 --> 47:47.655
There's a shit storm coming!

47:47.948 --> 47:51.742
Some crazy bastards pissed off Zeus
and he's on the warpath!

47:51.869 --> 47:53.035
Oh, yeah, that was us.

47:53.370 --> 47:54.412
And look!

47:57.249 --> 47:58.541
Wait!

47:58.625 --> 48:00.710
Stop following me!

48:00.794 --> 48:02.587
All we need is a bioelectric transmitter.

48:02.671 --> 48:03.713
She's gonna die!

48:04.506 --> 48:06.591
Are you insane?

48:06.675 --> 48:07.758
Argh.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.802
She's a robot!

48:10.304 --> 48:11.429
Yeah, but she's my friend.

48:11.513 --> 48:12.713
I don't want to hear about it!

48:13.640 --> 48:15.349
Bagu, please!

48:19.980 --> 48:22.982
And why should I help you?

48:23.859 --> 48:24.901
What's in it for me?

48:25.944 --> 48:26.986
Um...

48:29.364 --> 48:30.364
You could have this.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.452
All right.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.205
But just because it's you.

48:39.541 --> 48:40.541
You need to head north,

48:41.126 --> 48:42.668
find highway 64.

48:43.045 --> 48:48.841
There, you'll find your...
Robot cemetery.

48:49.426 --> 48:52.306
You might have some luck finding
whatever it is you're looking for there.

48:52.512 --> 48:53.752
That is, if you're still alive.

48:55.641 --> 48:59.101
Now that's all I know,
so leave me alone. Hmm?

49:01.021 --> 49:02.939
- Thank you!
- Thank you. Thank you.

49:03.023 --> 49:04.023
Yeah.

49:04.107 --> 49:07.568
Oh, and uh, Bagu, the water, it's people.

49:10.322 --> 49:11.656
People?

49:12.407 --> 49:13.449
Nonsense.

49:14.660 --> 49:15.868
Whoo-hoo!

49:17.329 --> 49:18.746
- Apple!
- Look at us ride!

49:18.830 --> 49:19.830
Over here!

49:58.370 --> 49:59.620
Apple!

50:13.593 --> 50:17.722
Stupid piece of God damn shit.

50:18.181 --> 50:25.104
Why does this aching son of a bitch
always have to happen to me?

50:25.188 --> 50:26.814
Ah!

50:34.740 --> 50:38.159
I mean, how could this day
get possibly fucking worse?

50:45.417 --> 50:46.500
Fuck!

51:17.240 --> 51:18.282
Hey there, sleepy head.

51:21.453 --> 51:22.578
Are you okay?

51:24.247 --> 51:25.247
I'm fine.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.126
Are you sure?

51:30.295 --> 51:31.462
Oh, yes.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.091
See, I have seven point five hearts left.

51:46.853 --> 51:50.022
Wait, how can you eat if you're a robot?

51:51.441 --> 51:54.985
Oh, I can eat, I can drink,
I can sleep, I can breathe.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.572
The illusion works better
if I behave 100% like a human.

52:00.492 --> 52:03.160
I mean, cos you know,

52:04.496 --> 52:07.581
no one wants to remind a human
that his best friend is a robot.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.670
Well, I actually think it's kind of cool

52:13.672 --> 52:15.381
that you're a robot.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.247
And, plus, you've got some pretty
serious fighting skills too.

52:29.688 --> 52:31.313
Do you want me to teach you?

52:34.693 --> 52:35.734
Yeah!

52:35.819 --> 52:36.861
Yes!

52:39.823 --> 52:43.617
Are you ready to become a master
in the art of kicking ass?

52:44.536 --> 52:49.373
- Yes.
- Strike first, strike hard, show no mercy!

52:51.710 --> 52:52.751
That's it!

52:53.920 --> 52:55.379
That's it?

52:55.463 --> 52:57.381
Eyes! Throat! Genitals!

52:58.133 --> 53:00.801
So, strike first.

53:00.886 --> 53:01.969
Always surprise your enemy.

53:03.388 --> 53:09.143
Strike hard, always remember the weak points
of the human body, eyes, throat, genitals.

53:09.227 --> 53:11.854
- Okay.
- And show no mercy,

53:11.938 --> 53:15.524
so, you know, show no mercy.

53:18.403 --> 53:19.486
Thank you.

53:20.488 --> 53:21.947
That was cool.

53:22.032 --> 53:26.035
- Oh, this is so much fun.
- I'm glad it is for you.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.459
I love watching the sky at night.

53:38.590 --> 53:40.841
Do you know why there are so many stars?

53:40.926 --> 53:43.969
Oh, because space consists
of a whole lot of dust and gas

53:44.054 --> 53:45.679
that gather to form
billions and billions of

53:45.764 --> 53:48.807
stars and suns across
the different galaxies of the universe?

53:50.393 --> 53:52.102
Yeah... No!

53:53.063 --> 53:56.106
I mean,
what I was going to say is that,

53:56.191 --> 54:00.527
my mom once told me that,
when somebody dies, a star is born.

54:02.072 --> 54:03.781
So when the apocalypse happened,

54:05.116 --> 54:09.078
the sky lit up with all the souls
of the people who died.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.669
So, your mom is up there?

54:20.048 --> 54:25.302
Yup, with my father. Up there in the sky.

54:33.144 --> 54:37.439
It's weird, I, uh... I never told
anyone about my parents before.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.166
I'm, I'm sorry.

54:57.335 --> 54:59.628
No worries, it could happen to anybody.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.174
We'll fix you...

55:05.051 --> 55:06.176
Promise.

55:07.470 --> 55:10.306
A T-Rex.

55:25.030 --> 55:26.488
Where the fuck am I?

55:32.537 --> 55:33.787
Zeus?

55:33.872 --> 55:35.497
How are you?

55:35.999 --> 55:39.209
You're looking fine,
and, uh, kind of serious.

55:40.628 --> 55:41.712
Is that a new coat?

55:46.217 --> 55:47.968
Oh!

55:48.053 --> 55:51.055
Oh, oh that's... That doesn't look good.

55:51.139 --> 55:52.264
No, that's bad, that's bad.

55:52.349 --> 55:54.975
Look, whatever it is,
I'm sure we can talk this through!

55:55.060 --> 55:59.229
Were you actually going to leave town
without saying goodbye?

55:59.898 --> 56:01.398
Me?

56:01.483 --> 56:02.483
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

56:02.567 --> 56:05.152
I was just gonna take
a few days off, you know?

56:05.236 --> 56:07.404
Go to the beach, work on my tan.

56:09.074 --> 56:12.493
Just... I could really use some vitamin D.

56:12.577 --> 56:13.827
You know, Vitamin D.

56:13.912 --> 56:19.500
I'm looking for a young boy, a young girl,
and a big strapping cowboy.

56:19.584 --> 56:20.793
Cowboy, huh?

56:21.586 --> 56:26.757
Wow. And a boy and a girl,
uh... Maybe! Maybe.

56:29.511 --> 56:31.095
Nah, it doesn't ring a bell.

56:31.179 --> 56:32.179
No.

56:35.642 --> 56:37.518
No, no, no, no, no!

56:37.602 --> 56:40.604
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but in case you haven't noticed,

56:41.189 --> 56:44.900
your guts are literally attached
to the wheel of this bicycle.

56:44.984 --> 56:46.360
This is...

56:46.444 --> 56:48.904
Ingenious! Yes, thank you.

56:48.988 --> 56:51.949
Now, I know

56:52.617 --> 56:54.952
that you know where they are.

56:57.372 --> 57:02.668
So, I suggest you start talking right away.

57:03.294 --> 57:04.545
The robot cemetery!

57:06.256 --> 57:07.673
They're at the robot cemetery.

57:08.049 --> 57:09.216
That's all I know...

57:09.300 --> 57:14.096
Well, that was quick,
rather disappointing actually.

57:14.180 --> 57:17.349
You're gonna help me
put these back in, right?

57:17.434 --> 57:18.475
- Mmm.
- Please?

57:18.560 --> 57:21.228
Do you have any idea how much
time it took to set this up?

57:21.312 --> 57:22.312
Huh?

57:23.314 --> 57:25.691
Yes, I'm sure you'll understand.

57:25.817 --> 57:27.359
No, no, no, no.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.194
Ah! No, no, no, no!

57:46.504 --> 57:48.172
Shh.

59:05.708 --> 59:06.792
It's a dead end!

59:29.607 --> 59:30.857
Apple.

59:33.444 --> 59:34.444
No!

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:03.724
I'm so sorry. We were so close.

01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:05.809
It's okay.

01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:09.104
You're the best friend that I've ever had.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:11.815
Don't die on me!

01:01:09.457 --> 01:01:11.500
We're here, hold on!

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:26.223
Apple, wake up!

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:28.100
Wake up!

01:01:29.394 --> 01:01:30.554
I don't wanna be alone again.

01:01:59.298 --> 01:02:02.217
I've been travelling all day,
and I've developed quite a thirst.

01:02:02.301 --> 01:02:06.012
Would you have a drop of untainted
water for a fellow traveller?

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.808
Lower your hammer please,
that won't be necessary.

01:02:11.102 --> 01:02:13.353
I know that my friend here doesn't
look quite as friendly as I do,

01:02:13.604 --> 01:02:17.357
but I assure you,
all I need is a simple cup of water.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:38.920
Thank you.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.842
Oh, that's wonderful.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.636
That's exactly what I needed.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.897
Now, where did you get the water?

01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.649
Because this is my land.

01:03:00.985 --> 01:03:04.154
Taking anything from my land
would be considered stealing.

01:03:04.405 --> 01:03:06.406
And you don't want to
steal from me, do you?

01:03:07.241 --> 01:03:09.159
You got what you wanted, now please leave.

01:03:10.661 --> 01:03:12.204
Where did you get the water?

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.207
It's OK, honey, I got this.

01:03:24.008 --> 01:03:25.884
It's all right, honey, he's got this.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:45.445
Death by drowning,
it's a luxury few men can afford.

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:47.697
Stop!

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:50.992
Hah, look at this.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:55.622
I admire your spirit, young lady,
but your story has come to an end.

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:57.249
Then let's make it memorable.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.046
No!

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.651
No.

01:04:24.735 --> 01:04:25.986
She's mine.

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:30.574
Stop!

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.660
Well, what have we got here?

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.081
All right, kid, take your best shot.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:55.932
No, don't bother,
he won't last long out there.

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.191
Fore!

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:53.156
You all right there, kid?

01:05:53.699 --> 01:05:55.825
You took quite a dose of that nasty gas.

01:05:59.163 --> 01:06:00.246
Where's Apple?

01:06:05.211 --> 01:06:06.336
I'm sorry, kid.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:30.360
Why'd you save me?

01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:32.988
I owed you one.

01:06:35.282 --> 01:06:36.950
Well, actually, I needed a new hand.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:42.418
I sure as hell didn't
expect to find you there.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:44.874
It's like fate or some shit.

01:06:51.424 --> 01:06:52.465
It's impressive, huh?

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:56.886
You know what that is?

01:06:57.304 --> 01:06:58.763
Turbo Mega Blaster.

01:07:01.225 --> 01:07:03.393
You sure know your shit, kid, don't ya?

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.735
I guess you know where
I'm going with this then, hmm?

01:07:16.073 --> 01:07:18.992
I'm meeting up with an old mate
and we're going straight to Zeus.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.120
We're going to shove that
thing so far up his ass,

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.664
that he'll taste his own shit.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.749
So, kid...

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:27.917
What do you say?

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:34.466
Let's roll.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.220
Yeah, let's roll.

01:08:16.591 --> 01:08:18.352
How does he keep sneaking
up on me like that?

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:29.645
What are you doing?

01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:37.319
Just play it cool, kid.

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:39.738
Trust me.

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:10.854
I love that dress!

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.929
You know, Frederick,
you make poor choices in friends.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:50.852
Ah, look, the arm-wrestler
has grown a new arm.

01:09:52.145 --> 01:09:53.688
What about you kid,

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:57.192
you feeling feisty after
losing your super power?

01:09:57.276 --> 01:10:02.363
And your girlfriend,
correction, robotic girlfriend.

01:10:02.865 --> 01:10:04.574
Here name was Apple!

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.536
I admire your spirit, kid,

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:11.998
but unfortunately your story's
about to come to an end.

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.459
Then let's make it memorable.

01:10:24.428 --> 01:10:25.637
Ah, you're the kid.

01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:27.680
Ha...

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:29.974
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:33.102
For Christ's sake,
will you shut the fuck up and let's fight!

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:39.567
I knew you'd be eager,
that's why I brought the party to you.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.508
It's play time.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.348
Get ready to fight, kid.

01:11:12.977 --> 01:11:14.394
This is going to get ugly.

01:11:30.494 --> 01:11:31.694
I don't know if I can do this.

01:11:31.745 --> 01:11:36.374
A man never knows how strong he is until
being strong is the only choice he has.

01:11:37.418 --> 01:11:38.793
Really?

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:41.087
I don't know, kid, but it sounds good.

01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:44.632
Argh!

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:50.221
Eyes!

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.347
Throat!

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:52.432
Genitals!

01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:57.770
Nice!

01:12:06.905 --> 01:12:07.947
Ladies...

01:12:44.943 --> 01:12:46.569
Now I'm feeling the love.

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.164
Come on, bitch, huh? Come on!

01:13:04.296 --> 01:13:06.130
You like that? Take this, bitch!

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:12.929
That's it, sweetheart. Come to daddy.

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.039
Ugh!

01:13:58.308 --> 01:13:59.392
Hey, kid!

01:14:52.613 --> 01:14:53.988
Fucker!

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:49.043
Good riddance, you fucker.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:56.193
You're alive.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:59.071
You didn't wait for me.

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:03.993
- I'm so sorry, I thought you were dead.
- No, no, no!

01:17:04.244 --> 01:17:05.745
I mean to start the fight.

01:17:07.914 --> 01:17:08.914
Oh...

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:12.376
Well, I brought you back your, um,

01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:16.464
um, turbo, uh, glove thing.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.220
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:17:32.314 --> 01:17:33.689
You son of a bitch.

01:17:38.028 --> 01:17:39.904
Oh, you son of a...

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.075
Such a rude individual.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:54.502
Look at us, huh?

01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:56.295
Déjà vu all over again.

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:01.258
Oh, and you were right, it was memorable.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:13.396
Now, what was so difficult about that?

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.368
Ah.

01:18:27.869 --> 01:18:30.079
Playtime is over Zeus.

01:20:11.932 --> 01:20:16.602
You know, I really like most people,
but you, I don't like.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:31.844
Ah!

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:38.684
Well, I've worn you far too long.

01:21:42.939 --> 01:21:44.523
So much for trying to fit in.

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:48.569
You're a robot?

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.740
Yeah, you didn't know?

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:54.408
Robot?

01:21:54.492 --> 01:22:00.039
Ha, I am a CC1-11, corporate companion,

01:22:00.123 --> 01:22:04.376
designed to create
and instigate corporate policy.

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:08.547
Fashioned to the likeness of my master.

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:12.509
He said to me,

01:22:13.428 --> 01:22:16.597
just before I bashed his head
in with his own golf club,

01:22:19.976 --> 01:22:22.436
"Remember, you're only a robot."

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.564
Only a robot!

01:22:27.067 --> 01:22:33.739
Well, I'm the one standing here, not him.

01:22:33.823 --> 01:22:36.408
Sir, you are very mean.

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:38.827
I don't expect a basic friendship unit

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:42.498
to have a CPU fast enough
to understand what I just said.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:43.999
But rest assured,

01:22:44.668 --> 01:22:48.504
human beings are highly inefficient,

01:22:49.714 --> 01:22:54.259
pests actually, not unlike cockroaches.

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:55.594
You're a monster!

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:57.846
I was designed by your kind.

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:01.058
You made me what I am.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:03.352
It was a mistake!

01:23:03.436 --> 01:23:04.687
And I'm trying to fix it!

01:23:05.897 --> 01:23:07.356
That's what super heroes do!

01:23:07.899 --> 01:23:09.274
How charming.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:12.027
Would you like to see what I do? Huh?

01:24:32.067 --> 01:24:34.193
You did good, Turbo Kid.

01:24:42.368 --> 01:24:47.456
And when you watch the sky at night,
I'll be there.

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:02.471
No.

01:26:14.043 --> 01:26:15.335
You did the right thing, kid.

01:26:21.050 --> 01:26:22.134
How's your shoulder?

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:24.052
Should be all right.

01:26:25.346 --> 01:26:26.889
You cannot kill this cowboy.

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:32.227
I can't believe you found
the fucking water source!

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:37.357
That's going to save hundreds of lives,
maybe more.

01:26:39.068 --> 01:26:40.068
Take good care of it.

01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:45.574
So you sure you want to leave, then?

01:26:52.248 --> 01:26:53.415
Where are you gonna go?

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:57.252
To see what the rest of
the wasteland looks like.

01:26:59.797 --> 01:27:02.257
Well, there's not much to see there, kid.

01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:09.223
I know.
