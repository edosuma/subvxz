01:23.226 --> 01:26.127
3000 block of Bagley, 4-17, 10-30.

01:27.797 --> 01:28.764
Get back!

01:28.965 --> 01:30.432
- I'll shoot her!
- Oh, my God!

01:30.634 --> 01:32.226
3-L-90. I repeat:

01:32.435 --> 01:35.893
3-L-90, request you notify hostage
negotiation team.

01:36.106 --> 01:38.506
Have them respond to my Location.

01:44.014 --> 01:46.414
- See anything?
- Get those cars out of here!

01:48.351 --> 01:51.549
Suspect is a male Caucasian,
approximately--

01:51.756 --> 01:53.815
I'm a reporter.
How Long have you been here?

01:54.692 --> 01:57.126
Domestic or drugs?
Is that his girlfriend?

01:57.328 --> 01:59.023
- Get out of here.
- Who is it?

01:59.230 --> 02:00.788
- Talk to me.
- Get him out of here.

02:01.398 --> 02:03.059
- Go on!
- I got my passes.

02:03.733 --> 02:05.564
- Shit.
- I have every right to be here.

02:05.769 --> 02:07.237
Where'd he go?

02:07.738 --> 02:10.901
Suspect has withdrawn into
the interior of the room.

02:11.108 --> 02:13.474
We no Longer have visual contact.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.721
That was my car.

03:00.125 --> 03:01.456
Holy--

03:11.471 --> 03:13.530
Having a Little car trouble?

03:17.043 --> 03:18.908
That's a keen observation.

03:19.445 --> 03:21.037
I can help you.

03:23.382 --> 03:24.441
It's the Jag.

03:26.019 --> 03:28.214
You want me to drive home in your car?

03:28.421 --> 03:30.150
I want you to take my car.

03:31.758 --> 03:34.283
I've had a lot of Luck Lately.
I don't need it.

03:34.927 --> 03:37.589
You're giving me a new Jaguar
and you don't want anything?

03:37.797 --> 03:40.426
I can prove it. Give me your card.

03:51.210 --> 03:52.507
I'll be in touch.

03:52.712 --> 03:55.580
What, you want me to kill your
wife or something?

03:55.816 --> 03:56.805
No.

03:57.017 --> 03:58.848
Tempting, but, no.

03:59.053 --> 04:01.851
Call it generosity between
two strangers.

04:03.357 --> 04:06.121
Generosity? It's a Jaguar.

04:06.327 --> 04:08.887
You expect me to drive home
in a new Jaguar?

04:09.096 --> 04:11.395
- That's right.
- You're a freak!

04:11.599 --> 04:12.896
You are a freak.

04:13.101 --> 04:16.661
You want me to get in this car? No way!
It'll probably blow up.

04:16.870 --> 04:20.202
That's real funny, bits and pieces of me
raining down in the street!

04:21.575 --> 04:24.442
You think I'm going near that thing,
you're nuts!

04:24.712 --> 04:26.475
Besides, I got a car.

04:29.017 --> 04:30.541
Sort of.

05:25.374 --> 05:26.739
What? You Like it?

05:27.209 --> 05:28.267
Cool blade, huh?

05:28.477 --> 05:31.470
- You want to see it?
- Keep it in your pants.

05:33.049 --> 05:34.311
Fag.

05:34.985 --> 05:38.011
- He's gonna kill you.
- I've got pepper spray.

06:24.802 --> 06:28.260
Apparently, none of you have ever
seen a new teacher before.

06:30.241 --> 06:31.469
I'm Mr. Simonet.

06:32.211 --> 06:34.042
Welcome to the seventh grade.

06:34.246 --> 06:38.739
Middle school, that hellish, shaky
bridge you all must cross...

06:38.983 --> 06:43.920
...before you become members of that
undyingly enviable high school elite.

06:44.355 --> 06:47.325
You may think you can't cross
this bridge fast enough.

06:47.526 --> 06:52.463
You'd rather close your eyes and not
think about it until it's all over.

06:52.865 --> 06:55.197
Well, I'm here to tell you...

06:55.400 --> 06:58.198
...that is not an option
in this class.

07:00.038 --> 07:01.266
Lateness.

07:03.842 --> 07:05.104
Tardiness.

07:05.310 --> 07:08.939
To be late for your first class
on your first day of school.

07:09.147 --> 07:11.047
What does that indicate?

07:12.050 --> 07:14.041
I'm having a bad hair day?

07:15.287 --> 07:18.313
Perhaps what it indicates is
a Lack of respect.

07:18.525 --> 07:21.858
You see, I'm going to be here
every day for you.

07:22.061 --> 07:26.293
And so I expect you to be here for me.

07:26.799 --> 07:29.528
On time, no excuses.

07:30.369 --> 07:31.199
Put that down.

07:32.104 --> 07:32.968
Wait.

07:35.508 --> 07:36.634
Now...

07:37.677 --> 07:40.544
...this class is social studies.

07:40.847 --> 07:44.613
That is you and the world. Yes.

07:44.817 --> 07:48.913
There is a world out there and even if
you don't want to meet it...

07:49.122 --> 07:52.581
...it's still going to hit you
right in the face.

07:53.227 --> 07:54.455
Believe me.

07:56.130 --> 08:00.088
Best start thinking about the world
now and what it means to you.

08:01.534 --> 08:05.163
What does the world mean to you?

08:07.041 --> 08:08.906
Come on! A Little class
participation.

08:09.109 --> 08:11.236
Is it just this class you
want to get out of?

08:11.445 --> 08:13.208
Your house, your street?

08:13.414 --> 08:17.009
Any further any of you want to go
than that? Yes?

08:17.284 --> 08:20.185
The mall. That's only two miles
away from me.

08:22.324 --> 08:24.382
Let me ask you another question.

08:24.725 --> 08:28.957
How often do you think about things
that happen outside of this town?

08:29.196 --> 08:32.597
Do you watch the news? Yes? No?

08:32.799 --> 08:36.794
All right, so we're not global thinkers
yet, but why aren't we?

08:38.707 --> 08:40.607
Because we're 11.

08:41.275 --> 08:42.799
Good point. What's your name?

08:43.510 --> 08:44.341
Trevor.

08:44.546 --> 08:47.606
Maybe Trevor's right. Why should
we think about the world?

08:47.816 --> 08:51.273
After all, what does the world
expect of us?

08:51.652 --> 08:52.881
Expect?

08:53.121 --> 08:53.985
Of you.

08:54.556 --> 08:58.014
What does the world expect of you?

08:59.561 --> 09:00.653
Nothing.

09:02.230 --> 09:03.561
Nothing.

09:04.366 --> 09:06.800
My God, boys and girls, he's right.

09:07.035 --> 09:08.264
Nothing.

09:08.804 --> 09:11.170
Here you are. You can't drive.
You can't vote.

09:11.374 --> 09:14.673
You can't go to the bathroom
without a pass. You're stuck...

09:15.411 --> 09:17.675
...right here in the seventh grade.

09:21.149 --> 09:22.480
But not forever...

09:23.118 --> 09:25.849
...because one day you'll be free.

09:30.226 --> 09:32.888
But what if on that day you're free...

09:33.295 --> 09:35.786
...you haven't prepared,
you're not ready...

09:35.998 --> 09:40.527
...and yet you Look around you
and you don't Like what the world is.

09:40.737 --> 09:42.637
What if the world...

09:43.473 --> 09:46.168
...is just a big disappointment?

09:46.909 --> 09:48.376
We're screwed.

09:48.644 --> 09:50.168
Unless....

09:51.447 --> 09:55.475
Unless you take the things that you
don't Like about this world...

09:55.719 --> 09:58.847
...and you flip them upside down right
on their ass.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.388
Don't tell your parents I
used that word.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.953
And you can start that...

10:04.494 --> 10:05.791
...today.

10:07.164 --> 10:10.065
This is your assignment.

10:10.301 --> 10:11.393
Extra credit.

10:11.602 --> 10:14.934
It goes on all year Long.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.638
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with this?

10:19.843 --> 10:21.572
What's the matter? Yes?

10:22.079 --> 10:23.603
It's, Like, so....

10:25.082 --> 10:27.244
There must be a word to finish
that sentence.

10:27.485 --> 10:28.782
- Someone help her.
- Weird.

10:28.986 --> 10:30.214
Weird. Crazy.

10:30.421 --> 10:31.251
Hard.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.219
- Bummer.
- Bummer.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.085
Hard.

10:36.527 --> 10:40.258
How about possible?

10:42.467 --> 10:44.162
It's possible.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.868
The realm of possibility...

10:49.507 --> 10:53.671
...exists where? In each of you.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.343
Here.

10:58.684 --> 11:00.675
So you can do it.

11:01.353 --> 11:04.584
You can surprise us. It's up to you.

11:05.290 --> 11:09.282
Or you can just sit back
and let it atrophy.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.460
Atrophy.

11:13.532 --> 11:17.730
If there is a word you hear that you
don't understand, there's a dictionary.

11:17.970 --> 11:19.301
Look it up.

11:19.605 --> 11:23.473
And there are these dictionaries which
you will carry at all times...

11:23.709 --> 11:27.304
...because in this class, we're going
to Learn to Love words...

11:28.046 --> 11:30.572
...and their meanings.
Any questions?

11:31.050 --> 11:32.210
Yeah.

11:32.719 --> 11:36.279
So, you'll Like, flunk us if we
don't change the world?

11:36.955 --> 11:38.820
No, I wouldn't do that.

11:39.725 --> 11:42.751
But you might just squeak by
with a "C".

11:46.866 --> 11:48.800
What'd you ever do to change
the world?

11:53.473 --> 11:55.737
Well, Trevor, I get a good
night's sleep.

11:55.975 --> 11:57.738
I eat a hearty breakfast.

11:57.977 --> 12:01.004
I show up on time...

12:02.749 --> 12:05.183
...and then I pass the buck to you.

12:08.688 --> 12:12.488
Now, I want you all to write your names
in these books and--

12:12.692 --> 12:13.920
What's your name?

12:14.260 --> 12:16.422
Molly, all right. I want Molly to
Look up the word atrophy...

12:19.166 --> 12:21.100
...and tell the class what it means.

15:30.796 --> 15:33.856
No, we're not in Milwaukee.

15:35.234 --> 15:37.202
Straight to hell. Straight to hell.

15:37.403 --> 15:39.736
Four tequilas.
Who's having the fourth one?

15:39.973 --> 15:42.065
- You are.
- Not for me, thank you.

15:42.307 --> 15:45.902
- We bought it for you.
- Thank you so much. No thanks.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.908
- Why not?
- I promised my kid.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.416
I know, it's horrible.
You guys have fun.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.141
Wait, wait, wait. Here.

15:53.385 --> 15:54.375
Thank you.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.885
What are you doing, Junior?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.958
What are your doing, Jun?
What are you doing?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.821
You got her now. You got her now.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.223
You got him now. You got him now.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.658
What time do you get off?

16:07.901 --> 16:09.664
If only I weren't married.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.899
He's married!

16:14.374 --> 16:16.842
I'm single! I'm single!

16:35.262 --> 16:37.161
- Hello?
- Hey.

16:39.866 --> 16:41.061
How'd it go?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.929
Are you there?
- Yeah.

16:43.137 --> 16:44.604
How'd it go?

16:44.872 --> 16:45.839
What?

16:46.107 --> 16:48.200
How'd it go?
How was your first day?

16:48.442 --> 16:49.466
Okay.

16:49.710 --> 16:52.941
Trev, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

16:53.380 --> 16:58.114
Sorry I wasn't home. I had
a chance to pick up another shift.

16:59.387 --> 17:00.786
You mad at me?

17:04.058 --> 17:05.650
Trev, what are you doing?

17:06.060 --> 17:07.391
Nothing.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.623
You find the spaghetti?

17:12.567 --> 17:13.965
I'm eating it.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.290
Good.

17:15.804 --> 17:17.169
Come on, tell me what happened.

17:17.405 --> 17:18.736
I got to go.

17:29.318 --> 17:30.579
Spoon?

17:31.153 --> 17:32.347
Spoon.

21:54.424 --> 21:55.721
Mom?

21:57.226 --> 21:58.454
Mom!

22:00.997 --> 22:03.658
My friend's coming in to
take a shower, okay?

22:04.266 --> 22:05.528
Okay.

22:25.989 --> 22:27.854
That's not really breakfast.

22:29.193 --> 22:30.659
You don't eat breakfast.

22:30.860 --> 22:32.088
Well, Let's have some.

22:32.295 --> 22:35.355
I'll make some eggs.
I'll have some too.

22:38.067 --> 22:39.797
You sure you won't throw up?

22:40.871 --> 22:43.101
- What's that mean?
- What do you think?

22:43.307 --> 22:44.467
Tell me what it means.

22:44.675 --> 22:47.041
- You're sneaking it.
- I'm not sneaking anything.

22:47.244 --> 22:48.336
Okay.

22:50.681 --> 22:52.672
Wait, I'm sorry. You're right.

22:52.883 --> 22:55.512
- I want to talk.
- You want to Lie to me.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.654
I don't want to Lie, I want to talk.

22:57.855 --> 22:59.720
- Do what you want.
- I want us to get along.

22:59.923 --> 23:00.912
I'm sorry.

23:01.124 --> 23:02.955
I can't find the toilet paper.

23:03.393 --> 23:04.553
- Who are you?
- It's Jerry.

23:04.761 --> 23:06.695
Get out! Get out of my house!

23:06.897 --> 23:07.989
- Thanks a Lot.
- Get out!

23:08.198 --> 23:10.564
- Do you need money for the bus?
- No, I got it.

23:10.902 --> 23:12.426
You said he could take a shower.

23:12.637 --> 23:14.036
- I never said that!
- You did.

23:14.239 --> 23:16.332
I said to Let a strange man
into my bathroom?

23:16.541 --> 23:18.168
He's my friend.

23:18.376 --> 23:19.968
You can't have a friend Like that.

23:20.211 --> 23:22.338
- It's for my assignment.
- What assignment?

23:22.547 --> 23:25.276
You won't get it.
Mr. Simonet will get it.

23:25.482 --> 23:28.043
Who's Mr. Simonet?
Hey, I'm talking--

23:28.253 --> 23:30.118
He's my teacher.

23:57.415 --> 23:58.405
Mr. Simonet?

23:58.617 --> 24:00.744
Yes, I'm Eugene...

24:01.287 --> 24:02.777
...Simonet.

24:05.791 --> 24:08.089
- Hello.
- Hello.

24:09.762 --> 24:12.322
- What is this assignment?
- Excuse me?

24:12.531 --> 24:15.228
What did you say for my son to
Let a homeless man in my house?

24:17.737 --> 24:19.204
I have two problems.

24:19.439 --> 24:21.668
One, I've no idea what
you're talking about...

24:21.874 --> 24:23.535
...and two, I don't know who you are.

24:23.742 --> 24:27.542
Arlene McKinney. My boy is in your
social studies class? Trevor?

24:28.547 --> 24:29.913
Trevor.

24:30.116 --> 24:34.177
Yes, he's very attentive. He's very
exigent, which I Like.

24:35.822 --> 24:38.052
- Exigent. Challenging, testing.
- I know what it means.

24:38.258 --> 24:40.624
Why did my kid bring a bum home?

24:40.827 --> 24:42.089
- I have no idea.
- Bullshit!

24:42.295 --> 24:44.389
I don't know how he interpreted
the assignment.

24:44.599 --> 24:47.123
How do you think he interpreted it?

24:47.500 --> 24:48.489
I don't know.

24:48.702 --> 24:51.865
If you want to know, why don't you
talk to your son?

24:52.072 --> 24:53.061
I talk to him.

24:53.273 --> 24:54.433
Really?

24:54.641 --> 24:58.634
Then why did you come down here to ask
me what the assignment is?

25:00.481 --> 25:02.244
It's not a state secret.

25:05.519 --> 25:07.282
Yeah? And?

25:08.990 --> 25:12.289
It's an assignment I give out at the
beginning of every year to inspire.

25:12.493 --> 25:14.357
I don't expect them to change the world.

25:14.561 --> 25:16.587
- You don't expect them to change--
- Excuse me.

25:16.831 --> 25:19.732
It's to get them to think,
not walk on water.

25:19.934 --> 25:23.028
An assignment they can't do?
What kind of teacher are you?

25:23.237 --> 25:25.068
I didn't say that.
They make attempts.

25:25.272 --> 25:27.604
Now and then they clean up graffiti--

25:27.842 --> 25:30.276
This is my kid. You don't know him.

25:31.580 --> 25:33.775
Tell him he can do something,
he'll believe you.

25:34.016 --> 25:36.348
And when he can't, it'll wipe him out.

25:36.551 --> 25:39.452
They ought to fire your ass
out of here right now.

25:40.922 --> 25:44.652
They probably won't do that because I
filled a very excellent quota.

25:44.859 --> 25:47.624
I'm just this side of parking in
the blue zone.

25:47.829 --> 25:52.061
You think you can do whatever you want
because your face is messed up?

25:53.535 --> 25:57.631
Why don't you put down in writing your
Little and Loud complaints...

25:57.839 --> 26:01.138
...and I'll make sure they get put
in the suggestion box.

26:04.747 --> 26:05.907
Jesus.

26:06.516 --> 26:08.177
You are really something.

26:08.384 --> 26:11.284
Thanks. I appreciate the euphemism.

26:11.486 --> 26:13.545
I've always wanted to be something.

26:20.863 --> 26:23.024
Can I help you with something, miss?

26:23.866 --> 26:25.163
No.

26:36.013 --> 26:40.005
Mr. Thorsen. Hold up, man!
I've been waiting all day for you.

26:40.216 --> 26:43.344
- Why won't you return my calls?
- We're not friends.

26:43.553 --> 26:46.283
I got the pink slip for the car.
Quite a stocking stuffer.

26:46.489 --> 26:49.323
- You can't accept it?
- No, that would make me a moron.

26:49.526 --> 26:51.790
I just want to know about
these instructions.

26:51.995 --> 26:53.690
Do what they say. Pay it forward.

26:53.897 --> 26:55.797
- Why?
- Because you've accepted the car.

26:55.999 --> 26:59.196
- You're obligated.
- What if I don't feel obligated?

26:59.403 --> 27:02.429
What if I take my new car, get some
hookers and drive to Mexico?

27:02.639 --> 27:03.662
I'll never know.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.104
What is this? Come on, for real.

27:06.310 --> 27:08.801
An attack of total altruism
from a Litigator.

27:09.012 --> 27:10.240
I've got a meeting.

27:10.447 --> 27:12.608
I've got a story. Okay?

27:12.816 --> 27:15.250
A partner at Channing and Moss
is giving away cars?

27:15.486 --> 27:19.047
Tell me a reason or I'll make one up.
Mine will be more interesting.

27:19.256 --> 27:23.159
You've gone dotty, you're wearing
crystals, keeping too many cats at home?

27:25.163 --> 27:26.721
Look. Listen, please!

27:26.931 --> 27:28.990
My ex-wife has everything. Okay?

27:29.200 --> 27:32.430
Plus, she's in a Lesbian relationship
just to piss me off.

27:32.669 --> 27:34.660
Help me out, please.

27:39.244 --> 27:41.212
My daughter has asthma.

27:41.513 --> 27:45.244
One night it was very bad,
the worst I'd ever seen it.

27:45.450 --> 27:48.419
It was the middle of the night,
emergency room.

27:48.920 --> 27:52.413
We were waiting forever.
Couldn't get anyone to pay attention.

28:01.933 --> 28:04.026
Her inhaler doesn't seem
to be working.

28:04.235 --> 28:05.793
Mr. Parker, what happened?

28:06.004 --> 28:08.303
My sister, she stabbed me.

28:08.507 --> 28:10.737
- We were here first.
- Stab wounds first.

28:10.943 --> 28:13.503
- She can't breathe. She's scared.
- I will Let you know.

28:13.712 --> 28:15.441
Somebody has to see her.

28:15.714 --> 28:18.182
It's never been this bad.
Do something.

28:18.384 --> 28:19.942
Would you just sit down?

28:20.152 --> 28:23.953
I'm sorry. We've been here 4 hours.
You need to get a doctor.

28:24.157 --> 28:25.646
No. Wait.

28:28.661 --> 28:30.219
That's bullshit.
Help her right now.

28:30.429 --> 28:32.294
- Excuse me?
- Why you giving me shit?

28:32.498 --> 28:33.726
Ain't you got some oxygen?

28:33.933 --> 28:35.195
Let me get the supervisor.

28:35.401 --> 28:38.029
You don't need a supervisor.
You the supervisor today.

28:38.237 --> 28:41.298
You are the supervisor today.
You feel me on that?

28:41.508 --> 28:45.410
Take your ass down the hall, put the
girl on the tray and supervise her...

28:45.612 --> 28:48.240
...and get her some goddamn air.

28:48.748 --> 28:52.411
I got your back, sis. Bitch, you're
still here. Shit!

28:55.522 --> 28:58.286
Let go of my arm, man.
This ain't fair, man!

28:58.625 --> 29:00.991
Come on! Come on, man. Damn!

29:01.194 --> 29:02.627
I thanked him...

29:02.929 --> 29:07.298
...and there were specific orifices in
which I was told to shove my thanks.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.559
He told me, "Just pay it forward."

29:09.770 --> 29:12.432
Three big favors for three other
people. That's it.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.835
So it's Like a pass-it-on thing, then.

29:15.042 --> 29:17.567
You and this Lowlife are in this chain
of do-gooders...

29:17.778 --> 29:21.304
...a kind of Mother Teresa conga Line?
That's a Little New-Agey for you.

29:21.514 --> 29:24.142
Sort of Tibetan? Are you in a cult?

29:25.051 --> 29:29.250
Mention my name, you'll be selling your
kidneys to pay for your Lawsuit.

29:29.457 --> 29:30.788
Cult.

29:31.325 --> 29:33.816
The guy! What was the guy's name?

29:34.028 --> 29:36.724
Sorry, I'm Late for my mass wedding.

30:05.994 --> 30:07.985
I know somebody's in here.

30:10.732 --> 30:12.360
I know you're there.

30:13.169 --> 30:15.932
Come out or I will find you
and shoot you.

30:16.138 --> 30:17.901
Please don't shoot.

30:20.242 --> 30:21.436
Please.

30:21.944 --> 30:23.605
You stay right there.

30:24.012 --> 30:27.004
If I see you move one--

30:32.922 --> 30:34.287
Please don't pick it up!

30:34.490 --> 30:36.754
Please don't! I'm not moving.

30:38.695 --> 30:39.957
Please.

30:42.597 --> 30:44.463
What are you doing to my truck?

30:45.969 --> 30:48.494
Let me show you. I'm just....

30:48.905 --> 30:51.032
I'm just going to open the door, okay?

31:01.819 --> 31:02.786
See?

31:03.220 --> 31:07.816
Might be easier for you to sell now.
Now that it works.

31:08.058 --> 31:09.888
I didn't ask for your help.

31:10.727 --> 31:12.558
You been Living in my garage?

31:12.762 --> 31:15.231
Not after tonight.
Can I come around and....

31:16.900 --> 31:20.267
I got a handyman job at the Royal Motel.
They're giving me a room.

31:20.471 --> 31:21.836
You stay right there!

31:22.072 --> 31:24.233
Please, I don't Like guns.

31:25.676 --> 31:28.167
What is going on with you and my son?

31:28.412 --> 31:29.845
He wanted to help somebody.

31:30.080 --> 31:34.017
Wanted to get somebody back on their
feet, so he gave me a Little money.

31:34.252 --> 31:36.652
- He gave you money?
- Yes, ma'am.

31:36.987 --> 31:38.614
That's his savings.

31:40.157 --> 31:43.285
Well, it's clothes and shoes
and I got the job off it.

31:45.095 --> 31:46.825
You think you can keep it?

31:47.198 --> 31:50.099
Looks to me Like you've got yourself
a Little problem.

31:54.806 --> 31:56.273
I can Lick it.

31:56.941 --> 31:59.307
How's that supposed to happen
all of a sudden?

31:59.844 --> 32:01.710
You ever been on the street?

32:04.282 --> 32:06.273
My mom took us pretty close.

32:06.851 --> 32:10.651
Well, you can't know, not until
you're Looking at a dumpster.

32:11.456 --> 32:16.393
But when you climb in the first time,
and pull the newspapers over you...

32:16.694 --> 32:20.358
...that's when you know you've
messed your Life up.

32:20.966 --> 32:25.426
Somebody comes along Like your son
and gives me a Leg up...

32:26.338 --> 32:27.805
...I'll take it.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.368
Even from a kid, I'll take it.

32:35.681 --> 32:38.343
I can't mess up again or I'll be dead.

32:39.919 --> 32:42.717
I appreciate that you're trying to pay
back Trevor--

32:42.922 --> 32:44.913
I'm not allowed to pay back Trevor.

32:45.157 --> 32:48.719
- Then what is it you're doing?
- I'm paying it forward.

32:51.164 --> 32:53.029
I know you want me to go.

32:55.202 --> 32:56.362
I'll go.

32:58.737 --> 33:00.671
What's paying it forward?

33:01.707 --> 33:03.231
That's me.

33:04.978 --> 33:07.913
And that's three people.

33:10.350 --> 33:14.753
And I'm going to help them, but it has
to be something really big...

33:15.989 --> 33:19.926
...something they can't do
by themselves.

33:20.428 --> 33:22.396
So I do it for them...

33:23.798 --> 33:26.891
...then they do it for
three other people.

33:28.902 --> 33:30.494
That's nine.

33:31.171 --> 33:34.698
And I do three more....

33:34.908 --> 33:37.935
That's 27, so--

33:38.179 --> 33:42.707
I'm not really good at math but it
gets big really fast. You know?

33:48.723 --> 33:50.350
All right, all right, all right.

33:50.558 --> 33:52.220
A Little articulation, please.

33:52.427 --> 33:54.451
- Yes?
- I think it's a good idea.

33:54.662 --> 33:56.596
- Shawn?
- It's stupid.

33:56.797 --> 33:58.128
- Adam?
- It's the honor system.

33:58.599 --> 34:00.658
- People blow off the honor system.
- So what?

34:00.868 --> 34:02.631
Just because you do.

34:03.304 --> 34:08.004
Trevor, the class thinks that you've
come up with an overly Utopian idea.

34:08.210 --> 34:10.143
Look that word up in a minute.

34:12.447 --> 34:14.415
Like a perfect world?

34:18.020 --> 34:19.317
So?

34:21.455 --> 34:25.585
So what put this idea in your head?

34:28.996 --> 34:29.929
Because....

34:30.132 --> 34:33.101
Everything sucks.

34:34.268 --> 34:35.702
He talked to you about this?

34:36.271 --> 34:38.467
We've had our discussions.

34:40.243 --> 34:41.972
But you don't have to worry...

34:42.178 --> 34:45.341
...because I'll tell him we
can't talk no more.

34:47.283 --> 34:48.806
No, don't do that.

34:50.918 --> 34:52.409
Would you Like a cup of coffee?

34:55.692 --> 34:56.681
Yes, ma'am.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.360
Okay.

35:07.470 --> 35:10.599
I called the president
to talk about pollution.

35:10.808 --> 35:13.436
But my mom said now they'll
put us on some List...

35:13.644 --> 35:15.271
...so she hung up.

35:15.678 --> 35:19.944
For this assignment, I put up recycling
fliers at two supermarkets.

35:20.149 --> 35:21.946
I'm going to put up a website
in Chinese.

35:22.151 --> 35:25.553
It'll tell all the kids in China to jump
up and down at the same time.

35:32.863 --> 35:35.593
The goal being to knock
the Earth off its axis.

35:35.833 --> 35:37.232
- Yeah.
- Thank you. Sit down.

35:39.336 --> 35:43.432
Well, your ideas are as surprising
as they are variegated.

35:43.674 --> 35:46.507
Add that to your List of words
to Look up.

35:46.844 --> 35:50.678
But I want to focus for a moment on one
project we heard today.

35:51.248 --> 35:56.186
I've been teaching for many years and
it's the first new idea that also...

35:56.955 --> 36:01.756
...requires an extreme act of faith in
the goodness of people.

36:02.260 --> 36:06.993
Trevor has made an attempt to
interact with the world...

36:07.198 --> 36:09.132
...and that was the assignment.

36:09.367 --> 36:13.269
And if I were an effusive person given
to easy praise...

36:13.471 --> 36:15.166
...I would call that...

36:15.807 --> 36:17.240
...admirable.

36:17.442 --> 36:20.468
The words from today:
Utopian, enigma, quantum.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.942
Add variegated.
I want you to go home--

36:28.187 --> 36:30.519
- Hey, Mr. Simonet.
- Hello.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.764
Were you just being nice?

36:43.703 --> 36:44.931
About what?

36:45.938 --> 36:47.530
About my idea.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.774
Do you think it's good or were you
just being teachery?

36:53.312 --> 36:54.279
Teachery?

36:55.448 --> 36:56.437
Bullshitting.

36:58.485 --> 37:00.919
Do I strike you as someone
falsely nice?

37:01.688 --> 37:02.780
No.

37:03.557 --> 37:05.615
You're not even really all that nice.

37:08.494 --> 37:12.328
Well, it was a slip-up
and it will not happen again.

37:17.804 --> 37:18.930
What?

37:21.675 --> 37:23.233
What happened to your face?

37:40.627 --> 37:43.357
Did you draw the short straw today,
Trevor?

37:44.865 --> 37:48.029
It's not a very pertinent subject to
social studies, is it?

37:48.469 --> 37:50.369
Go and tell them that's
what I said.

37:50.571 --> 37:52.004
Tell who?

37:52.240 --> 37:53.764
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:19.201 --> 38:22.659
- You know where Jerry is?
- Over there in 15.

38:54.570 --> 38:56.265
It's more product.

38:56.472 --> 38:57.962
Who is it?

38:58.640 --> 39:00.130
It's Trevor.

39:00.342 --> 39:02.401
I'm Looking for Jerry.

39:04.180 --> 39:05.977
Jerry's not here.

39:07.750 --> 39:09.274
When will he be back?

39:09.486 --> 39:13.320
He's not coming back.
Now get out of here.

39:19.230 --> 39:20.390
Jerry?

39:20.598 --> 39:22.531
Get out of here!

39:24.767 --> 39:27.133
Please come out, Jerry.

40:44.849 --> 40:48.808
I remember in 1976 there were those
programs in the school system...

40:49.020 --> 40:52.616
- ...and now, all that's gone.
- I gotta go.

40:55.227 --> 40:58.560
You ran out of class this morning.
I wanted to talk to you.

41:51.451 --> 41:53.009
- Hello.
- Hello.

41:53.854 --> 41:54.913
Come in.

42:01.996 --> 42:03.725
Trevor's not feeling good.

42:03.931 --> 42:06.125
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

42:06.333 --> 42:07.800
Just a tummy ache.

42:08.201 --> 42:09.668
Do you want to come in?

42:09.936 --> 42:11.598
Sure. Thank you.

42:13.441 --> 42:15.807
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

42:16.944 --> 42:19.003
- It's a very beautiful home.
- Thank you.

42:19.213 --> 42:21.147
Have you lived in Vegas your
whole Life?

42:21.349 --> 42:22.509
Yeah.

42:29.358 --> 42:34.294
I told him if you wanted to talk to me
I would come to the school.

42:35.463 --> 42:38.330
Mrs. McKinney, I didn't ask to see you.

42:39.367 --> 42:41.062
Well, Trevor said you did.

42:41.804 --> 42:44.534
Yeah and he gave me a note from you...

42:46.041 --> 42:48.236
...which you didn't write.

42:48.477 --> 42:50.502
He gave you a note from me?

42:52.681 --> 42:56.549
Oh, God, that's horrible.
He's been so--

42:56.752 --> 42:59.449
- No, I didn't mean you.
- No explanation required.

42:59.656 --> 43:01.384
- Don't elaborate.
- It's not personal.

43:01.590 --> 43:03.558
- I'm used to this.
- Would you stop?

43:03.892 --> 43:06.383
Can we just rewind here a Little bit?

43:06.995 --> 43:11.830
I obviously didn't realize
how much Trevor Likes you.

43:12.334 --> 43:15.668
That's nothing that we can't discuss
on parent-teacher night.

43:16.005 --> 43:17.939
Then why did you come?

43:19.209 --> 43:22.440
Why didn't you just tell me to
come to the school?

43:25.515 --> 43:28.074
Because you came to the school...

43:29.085 --> 43:30.848
...to talk to me about your son...

43:31.554 --> 43:33.522
...and I behaved Like a--

43:33.723 --> 43:35.020
An asshole?

43:36.860 --> 43:37.952
Sorry.

43:38.862 --> 43:40.796
Is that too trailer-trash a word?

43:42.799 --> 43:44.995
How's "rat bastard" sit with you?

43:45.202 --> 43:46.066
It's pretty good.

43:46.937 --> 43:48.564
- "Dickhead"?
- Oh, I Like that.

43:51.976 --> 43:53.204
Look, I'm--

44:07.057 --> 44:09.252
I made all this food.

44:10.427 --> 44:12.156
It's just sitting here.

44:16.668 --> 44:19.501
I really don't know who else to
talk to about him.

44:22.273 --> 44:24.673
- This is good.
- Thanks.

44:24.909 --> 44:27.139
I don't understand.
This is summer school?

44:28.779 --> 44:31.248
Why do you think Trevor stopped
talking to you?

44:31.449 --> 44:32.848
I don't know.

44:33.752 --> 44:35.413
He seems mad.

44:36.488 --> 44:39.252
Seventh grade is difficult,
but he seems happy at school.

44:40.926 --> 44:43.417
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's fine.

44:43.929 --> 44:45.191
How much do you see him?

44:45.931 --> 44:48.025
- As much as I can.
- How much is that?

44:49.100 --> 44:53.469
I'm not doing a bunch of skanky guys
instead of spending time with my son.

44:54.239 --> 44:55.968
I got two jobs.

44:57.776 --> 45:00.176
Right. I meant that.

45:00.612 --> 45:02.581
Couldn't have just been a question.

45:06.919 --> 45:10.286
Mrs. McKinney, do you think there
might be something...

45:10.523 --> 45:13.492
...outside of school that might be
bothering him?

45:14.727 --> 45:16.126
I don't know.

45:18.364 --> 45:21.356
I'm going to have to consult
my spirit guides here.

45:21.567 --> 45:23.865
You tell me Trevor's withholding
from you...

45:24.070 --> 45:27.801
...but won't tell me anything specific,
and you want me to divine why.

45:28.274 --> 45:32.005
Divine why?
You always talk Like that?

45:32.211 --> 45:33.236
Yes.

45:33.447 --> 45:35.938
You go to some big fancy school?

45:36.450 --> 45:37.576
Yes.

45:37.784 --> 45:40.309
Think you could stop rubbing
my nose in it?

45:46.292 --> 45:47.623
Is there a father?

45:48.094 --> 45:50.120
He doesn't Live here anymore.

45:50.664 --> 45:52.256
I don't know where he is.

45:52.466 --> 45:54.491
I know what that's Like.

45:55.102 --> 45:58.902
Arlene, I've called you five times.

45:59.106 --> 46:00.095
- Bonnie.
- No, Listen.

46:00.307 --> 46:04.038
You don't call your sponsor once in
a while, you don't have a sponsor.

46:04.479 --> 46:06.777
This is Eugene Simonet.

46:07.649 --> 46:09.640
You're not supposed to date for
a year.

46:09.851 --> 46:12.284
- It isn't a date.
- No, I'm Trevor's teacher.

46:12.686 --> 46:13.880
We're having a conference.

46:15.522 --> 46:16.819
We're done.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.286
Were done.

46:37.546 --> 46:39.172
How could you do that to me?

46:39.681 --> 46:41.672
Write a Letter to him, sign my name?

46:41.883 --> 46:45.444
- Why'd you have to mess everything up?
- I didn't mess this up.

46:45.653 --> 46:48.679
What were you doing?
Standing at the door Listening?

46:48.890 --> 46:51.985
- What happened to your stomachache?
- Why? You always Lie.

46:52.194 --> 46:54.992
This wasn't my fault.
This was embarrassing.

46:55.197 --> 46:57.097
I did something good
and you don't know it.

46:57.299 --> 46:59.199
Honey, Listen.

47:00.235 --> 47:04.171
You can't just put two people together
and make them Like each other.

47:04.373 --> 47:06.898
You only Like people you
can get drunk with.

47:08.944 --> 47:11.037
You're waiting for him to come back.

47:11.246 --> 47:12.907
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are!

47:13.115 --> 47:14.343
No, I'm not!

47:14.583 --> 47:17.245
- Your father's not getting his foot--
- That's what you always say.

47:17.453 --> 47:19.444
- I mean it now.
- You always mean it.

47:19.655 --> 47:22.591
What do you want me to say?
I say it, I mean it.

47:22.792 --> 47:25.818
When he's around you don't care
what happens to me.

47:26.062 --> 47:27.529
You don't even know I'm in the house.

47:27.731 --> 47:29.722
- That's not true.
- It's true.

47:29.933 --> 47:31.594
I Love you.

47:31.801 --> 47:32.790
I Love you.

47:33.002 --> 47:34.299
I'm doing the best I can.

47:34.503 --> 47:35.970
Don't Love me.
I hate the way you Look.

47:36.171 --> 47:37.570
Trevor, you need to stop.

47:37.773 --> 47:39.071
I hate that you're my mother.

49:29.755 --> 49:31.882
Trev, I'm going to come in, okay?

49:42.301 --> 49:44.236
You said that an hour ago.

49:45.706 --> 49:48.402
Do you understand my kid is missing?

49:50.409 --> 49:53.640
If I had a car I'd be out
Looking for him!

50:05.659 --> 50:07.627
What time do you think he took off?

50:07.928 --> 50:11.591
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

50:11.832 --> 50:14.427
Bonnie wasn't home.
The cops wouldn't come.

50:14.636 --> 50:17.195
And my friends are all drunks.

50:17.404 --> 50:19.634
- It's okay.
- And so am I.

50:20.174 --> 50:21.732
I'm a drunk too.

50:25.746 --> 50:29.079
I believe some people refer to
that as "in recovery."

50:38.293 --> 50:39.726
Where are you going?

51:06.355 --> 51:07.583
Got enough?

51:07.790 --> 51:11.418
Need a ticket somewhere? Come on,
I'll get you a ticket.

51:11.626 --> 51:13.059
Come with me. I'll get you a ticket.

51:13.261 --> 51:15.627
I'll get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch!

51:15.830 --> 51:17.560
Honey, are you okay?

51:38.154 --> 51:41.145
For the rest of my Life, I can
never be as sorry...

51:41.357 --> 51:44.019
...as I am for what I did to you.

51:52.002 --> 51:53.629
I didn't drink.

51:54.237 --> 51:56.671
I wanted to, but I didn't.

52:06.116 --> 52:08.414
You got no reason to trust me...

52:09.753 --> 52:13.086
...and I know you don't want to hear
any more promises...

52:13.923 --> 52:15.982
...so I'm just gonna tell you
the truth.

52:18.928 --> 52:20.453
I have a problem.

52:22.099 --> 52:25.000
I have a really bad problem.

52:26.203 --> 52:27.830
I've got to stop.

52:31.175 --> 52:33.234
And if you can be with me on this...

52:33.443 --> 52:38.279
...if you can think it's possible
that I can do it...

52:39.784 --> 52:41.945
...then I think maybe I can.

52:43.654 --> 52:45.087
If you just...

52:46.691 --> 52:49.387
...try a Little bit and help--

53:11.783 --> 53:12.772
You're still here?

53:12.984 --> 53:14.815
I hope it's okay.

53:15.020 --> 53:17.011
- He's asleep.
- Good, okay.

53:17.222 --> 53:18.985
How did you know where he was?

53:19.558 --> 53:23.188
Well, kids, they either hitchhike
or they take a bus.

53:23.396 --> 53:25.364
- Listen--
- You're welcome.

53:26.666 --> 53:27.927
No, you don't have to.

53:28.133 --> 53:31.796
- I understand--
- Wait. Goddamn, I want to thank you.

53:34.272 --> 53:35.637
Thank you.

53:35.974 --> 53:37.169
You're welcome.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.775
- Wasn't quite worth it, was it?
- No.

53:43.516 --> 53:47.145
I was wondering, do you want to come
back here sometime?

53:47.353 --> 53:49.014
Have dinner with me?

53:53.427 --> 53:58.193
I'm not entirely sure
that would be appropriate.

53:59.031 --> 54:01.795
Okay. I understand.

54:02.602 --> 54:04.297
- Good night.
- Good night.

54:15.516 --> 54:18.280
Why'd you do that man
the favor, Sidney?

54:19.520 --> 54:21.488
No, it's Like three favors, player.

54:21.688 --> 54:23.211
You got to do three.

54:23.456 --> 54:26.051
I'll do the other two here
for my folks.

54:26.293 --> 54:28.022
A Lot of brothers need favors in here.

54:28.228 --> 54:30.128
But who told you to do it?

54:33.734 --> 54:36.430
It's Like this idea I got.

54:38.172 --> 54:39.571
You gonna put this on TV?

54:39.808 --> 54:42.333
How did you come up with
an idea Like that?

54:43.645 --> 54:45.340
Man, it's Like....

54:46.247 --> 54:50.148
It's Like the world is a shithole.
Excuse my French and shit.

54:50.350 --> 54:51.578
And it's Like...

54:52.653 --> 54:55.087
...I just thought, Like, boom!

54:55.323 --> 54:58.258
Like the whole shit could be,
Like, better.

54:59.894 --> 55:01.759
It didn't start with anyone else?

55:02.697 --> 55:04.562
No, nigger.
That shit came from here.

55:04.766 --> 55:07.360
The shit came from my head.
I can't Lie.

55:07.569 --> 55:12.234
I been through some heavy-ass shit.

55:12.975 --> 55:15.705
But not no more,
because it changed me.

55:15.911 --> 55:17.537
And I'm changing this place, man.

55:17.745 --> 55:20.543
I mean, people are Listening to me.

55:20.748 --> 55:22.739
People are staying clean.

55:25.053 --> 55:29.684
I mean, it's Like some cosmic
Aristotle shit. You feel me?

55:30.526 --> 55:32.585
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no doubt.

55:32.795 --> 55:35.059
- I feel you.
- No doubt, dog, no doubt.

55:35.564 --> 55:38.055
The thing is, Sidney...

55:40.436 --> 55:43.770
...somebody else is saying
that pay it forward was their idea.

55:45.674 --> 55:46.436
Who?

55:51.580 --> 55:52.672
I think you know who.

55:55.384 --> 55:56.373
That bitch?

55:57.286 --> 55:58.879
She a Lying-ass bitch.

55:59.089 --> 56:01.956
She's a Lying bitch.
She's got your head.

56:02.158 --> 56:04.217
She makes a pretty good case,
though, Sid.

56:04.427 --> 56:05.985
That old crusty bag Lady?

56:06.196 --> 56:08.994
This is all from me.
All from my heart, dog.

56:09.199 --> 56:12.895
Sidney, it doesn't matter if you got
it from the Lady or not.

56:13.102 --> 56:14.661
You're the one paying it forward.

56:14.871 --> 56:17.567
In prison, no Less.
The parole board will eat that up.

56:19.576 --> 56:21.806
- Oh, the parole board.
- The parole board.

56:23.480 --> 56:26.449
Oh, snap, yo. You good, man.

56:26.650 --> 56:29.245
It's Like a carrot for
the mouse and shit.

56:30.488 --> 56:34.822
No doubt. It's too bad my parole don't
come up for another year, B.

56:38.296 --> 56:41.628
What if I can make it so your parole
comes up next month?

58:00.279 --> 58:01.677
Hello.

58:02.882 --> 58:04.975
Oh, hello.

58:06.886 --> 58:08.410
Did you know I worked here?

58:09.822 --> 58:11.619
No, I didn't. Really.

58:13.860 --> 58:16.556
Just dropped in for
a Little game of craps?

58:20.000 --> 58:22.696
No, I Like that coffee shop.

58:23.303 --> 58:24.964
They have good food.

58:26.106 --> 58:28.539
Yeah, they got good pancakes.

58:29.709 --> 58:30.835
Yeah.

58:31.711 --> 58:32.905
Fluffy.

58:35.115 --> 58:38.107
- Want me to bring you back something?
- Oh, no, thanks.

58:38.352 --> 58:41.344
- I get off in an hour.
- Really?

58:42.189 --> 58:43.884
Yeah, really.

58:47.561 --> 58:51.191
Well, if you were going to eat
anyway then....

58:53.301 --> 58:55.292
If you wanted, maybe....

58:56.804 --> 58:58.863
If you were hungry, we could....

58:59.773 --> 59:02.367
We could, if you were,
if you want to...

59:05.847 --> 59:07.314
...eat something...

59:09.117 --> 59:10.550
...sometime.

59:15.657 --> 59:17.488
Give me a seven iron, please.

59:17.692 --> 59:18.818
Yes, sir.

59:30.705 --> 59:32.172
May I help you?

59:33.308 --> 59:35.208
I am not stalking the governor, Jordy.

59:36.144 --> 59:37.840
Shit. Chandler.

59:39.014 --> 59:41.847
You scared me. You Look Like crap.
What are you doing here?

59:42.051 --> 59:44.849
- I want to talk to him, Jordan.
- Your questions piss him off.

59:45.054 --> 59:46.919
- Is that why I got the bounce?
- He won't talk to you.

59:47.123 --> 59:49.057
- Tell him I'm a candygram.
- Stop it.

59:49.258 --> 59:52.591
I've been sitting on a story for
2 years about a party he had.

59:52.795 --> 59:57.255
The clean-up crew found syringes,
size 12 high heels, animal droppings.

59:57.466 --> 59:59.366
That can't be right, can it?

01:00:00.936 --> 01:00:02.426
You really had this, you'd have used it.

01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:04.969
Bullshit. His friends in high places
had me kill it...

01:00:05.174 --> 01:00:08.235
...but since I got fired,
I'm not feeling that Loyal.

01:00:09.646 --> 01:00:12.171
- What do you want?
- Four million dollars.

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:15.550
I'm kidding, man. Relax.

01:00:17.053 --> 01:00:19.077
A phone call.
I just need a phone call.

01:00:19.288 --> 01:00:22.883
I need a massage for a friend's
parole date. That's it.

01:00:28.965 --> 01:00:31.433
- They kept me "0 minutes over.
- Did you call him?

01:00:31.635 --> 01:00:34.968
I couldn't remember the name of the
restaurant. I remember the hotel--

01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:38.734
If you're Late he thinks
it means you don't respect him.

01:00:38.943 --> 01:00:39.773
What?

01:00:39.977 --> 01:00:43.140
If you're Late, he'll think it means
you don't respect him.

01:00:51.254 --> 01:00:52.221
Wear this.

01:00:52.422 --> 01:00:55.415
- I want to wear the green dress.
- You Look Like a vampire in that.

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.184
I got to take a shower.

01:00:57.395 --> 01:00:59.056
- What?
- I smell horrible.

01:00:59.263 --> 01:01:02.721
No, you don't! You smell good.
You smell Like roses or something.

01:01:02.934 --> 01:01:05.562
Let me just wash under my arms.
Are you sure?

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:06.862
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:01:17.181 --> 01:01:20.446
Don't interrupt him in
the middle of a sentence.

01:01:20.985 --> 01:01:22.452
Am I supposed to raise my hand?

01:01:22.687 --> 01:01:25.247
- Get me my shoes. Those sandals.
- No, these.

01:01:25.456 --> 01:01:27.322
I'm not wearing those.
They're too sexy.

01:01:27.526 --> 01:01:29.221
You're Late. You owe him.

01:01:29.428 --> 01:01:32.591
- I owe him? Who are you?
- Go.

01:01:34.633 --> 01:01:37.329
No stupid jokes! He's not
that kind of person.

01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:41.563
Thank you very much. Where's the phone?
I got to call for a cab.

01:01:41.773 --> 01:01:44.139
If I take a bus, I'll be
another hour Late.

01:01:44.376 --> 01:01:47.539
- Stop yapping.
- I've got to call for a cab.

01:01:50.282 --> 01:01:51.579
Oh, my God!

01:01:53.118 --> 01:01:55.586
Oh, my God. You're just about....

01:01:55.787 --> 01:01:58.120
You're the greatest son in the world!

01:01:58.324 --> 01:02:01.521
Okay, you have to go.
Here, here.

01:02:01.728 --> 01:02:02.922
Go, go.

01:02:03.596 --> 01:02:05.928
- Lock both doors!
- I will.

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:11.069
- I Love you!
- Love you too, Mom.

01:02:35.862 --> 01:02:37.454
I respect you!

01:02:38.998 --> 01:02:40.590
They kept me Late at work...

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:43.565
...and then I got on the bus to go
home and change, which was stupid.

01:02:43.771 --> 01:02:45.762
I'm sorry, but I was all the way--

01:02:47.508 --> 01:02:49.100
You're right on time.

01:03:03.357 --> 01:03:04.551
I'm sorry.

01:03:20.175 --> 01:03:23.576
I was Living in Vegas. One night I
was walking down the street.

01:03:23.778 --> 01:03:25.939
Minding my own. Wasn't doing
nothing to nobody.

01:03:26.581 --> 01:03:28.515
I was just on my way to church.

01:03:30.785 --> 01:03:34.346
Out of nowhere these five Bloods just
peeled out of a truck.

01:03:34.556 --> 01:03:37.719
And one of them, man,
was real black.

01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:41.094
Man, I start swinging one by one
Like, "Nigger, take that!"

01:03:41.296 --> 01:03:43.764
Like Ali on them bitches.
I was like....

01:03:44.566 --> 01:03:46.501
"What's up, nigger, what's up?"

01:03:47.236 --> 01:03:51.104
All five of them got up
and started chasing me, man.

01:03:51.307 --> 01:03:53.104
"We going to kill you, Crip."

01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:55.607
I was like,
"You can't catch me, Blood."

01:03:56.578 --> 01:04:00.070
Then, man, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere...

01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:02.614
...that's when I ran into
this old lady.

01:04:02.918 --> 01:04:04.783
That's who you want to know about.

01:04:15.431 --> 01:04:16.557
Shit!

01:04:18.168 --> 01:04:20.864
Hey, you in trouble?

01:04:22.572 --> 01:04:24.664
- What?
- Get in.

01:04:26.075 --> 01:04:27.372
Get in?

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.168
Come on, get in.

01:04:33.083 --> 01:04:34.243
Shit!

01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.226
What are we doing?

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.197
Whatever we want.

01:05:29.874 --> 01:05:30.863
Damn!

01:05:31.075 --> 01:05:35.809
You think I'm going for your dried-up
crusty ass? Whatever.

01:05:36.014 --> 01:05:39.211
Shoot. I smell better than you do.

01:05:40.185 --> 01:05:41.379
Yeah, all right.

01:05:42.187 --> 01:05:44.587
All right, so what?
What you want?

01:05:46.124 --> 01:05:47.557
Don't matter...

01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:51.195
...because you ain't going to do it.

01:05:53.565 --> 01:05:56.796
You damn right about that. Shit.

01:05:58.704 --> 01:06:00.865
Hey, not in my car.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:03.140
Shit, not in my car.

01:06:03.442 --> 01:06:05.307
Oh, my bad. My bad.

01:06:05.577 --> 01:06:09.537
This is your pad? You don't want me
to jack up your pretty curtains.

01:06:09.749 --> 01:06:12.047
Son of a bitch.

01:06:12.252 --> 01:06:16.381
I paid it forward for a hophead
son of a bitch.

01:06:17.656 --> 01:06:20.147
You paid it what? I didn't hear that.

01:06:21.326 --> 01:06:25.229
I ain't going to tell you because your
ass ain't good enough to touch it.

01:06:25.431 --> 01:06:27.592
Oh, my ass ain't good enough, huh?

01:06:30.637 --> 01:06:32.332
Now you gonna tell me.

01:06:35.008 --> 01:06:37.910
You gonna tell me.

01:06:38.112 --> 01:06:42.207
An old bat Living in her car in Las
Vegas tells you about pay it forward?

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:45.942
She ain't want to, but I wouldn't
stop until she Let it out.

01:06:46.152 --> 01:06:49.144
What I really want to know is why?

01:06:49.355 --> 01:06:51.414
Why did you pay it forward?

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:57.329
Because don't nobody tell me what
I can and can't touch.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.725
You're not supposed to date
for a year.

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:03.369
They're not dates.

01:07:03.604 --> 01:07:05.071
Seven dinners. What are they?

01:07:05.272 --> 01:07:08.331
- It's a couple of adults sitting down.
- Does he pay?

01:07:08.541 --> 01:07:11.375
- He pays for everything.
- Did anybody ask you?

01:07:11.612 --> 01:07:13.910
- He doesn't know many people.
- He Likes her.

01:07:14.114 --> 01:07:16.674
- So?
- He fixed your TV remote.

01:07:16.884 --> 01:07:20.149
- That's an engagement ring.
- And he doesn't drink.

01:07:20.354 --> 01:07:23.346
Don't you got to pee? Look.

01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:28.221
- I need a smoke.
- Yeah. Over there.

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:32.157
- So has he kissed you?
- No, no, no, no.

01:07:32.367 --> 01:07:34.130
Does he want to?

01:07:35.336 --> 01:07:37.566
Sometimes I think he does.

01:07:38.806 --> 01:07:41.139
He can't really want to
or he would've.

01:07:42.244 --> 01:07:43.404
Do you want him to?

01:07:45.313 --> 01:07:46.507
I don't know.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.181
It's just taking forever.

01:07:51.386 --> 01:07:54.822
You ever gotten to know somebody
before you went to bed with him?

01:08:01.364 --> 01:08:04.093
- Is that bad?
- It's pathetic.

01:08:12.742 --> 01:08:14.175
Well, good night.

01:08:17.046 --> 01:08:18.741
Do you want to come in?

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:22.549
And stay?

01:08:26.322 --> 01:08:27.312
Come in.

01:08:30.693 --> 01:08:32.786
Trevor's inside the house.

01:08:32.995 --> 01:08:35.259
Well, he sleeps Like the dead.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.060
I don't want to make it any
harder for you.

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:44.231
You're supposed to wait a year.
Isn't that what Bonnie said?

01:08:44.441 --> 01:08:45.930
Okay.

01:08:51.982 --> 01:08:53.506
I can't.

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:00.246
I'm sorry.

01:09:01.524 --> 01:09:03.685
No. I don't mean I can't.

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:08.563
It's just....

01:09:09.332 --> 01:09:10.630
What?

01:09:14.538 --> 01:09:16.529
This is complicated.

01:09:18.576 --> 01:09:22.944
I get it. It's okay to say you
don't Like me that way.

01:09:27.117 --> 01:09:29.278
Is that what you think it is?

01:09:30.054 --> 01:09:31.544
It's okay.

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:37.484
How could you ever think that?

01:10:14.299 --> 01:10:15.391
What?

01:10:16.436 --> 01:10:17.926
What is it?

01:10:44.097 --> 01:10:47.624
- And you're doing this because?
- I need more Links.

01:10:47.967 --> 01:10:50.902
You're spending $300 to find
an old Lady...

01:10:51.137 --> 01:10:53.571
...so you can sell a story for $300.

01:10:53.807 --> 01:10:56.867
It's a news magazine feature. It's
not something you wipe your ass with.

01:10:57.076 --> 01:11:00.409
You have a Lovely way of
expressing yourself.

01:11:00.647 --> 01:11:03.811
Do me a favor.
Don't change the Locks on me, okay?

01:11:04.218 --> 01:11:06.379
Chris? What are you hoping this'll be?

01:11:06.587 --> 01:11:08.987
You know, something that clears a check.

01:11:10.524 --> 01:11:12.185
Are you sure that's all?

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:16.123
I drank the Last of the coffee.
Please put it on the List.

01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:22.259
Bye.

01:11:45.326 --> 01:11:46.816
Who's there?

01:11:49.965 --> 01:11:51.933
- Do you Look down on me?
- What?

01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:54.158
- Do you Look down on me?
- No.

01:11:54.402 --> 01:11:57.132
I don't talk Like you. I haven't
read the stuff you read.

01:11:57.339 --> 01:11:59.068
That's not pertinent,
and you know it.

01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:01.936
Don't talk to me Like that!

01:12:02.911 --> 01:12:06.439
I'm sorry, but that's the way I talk.
Words are all I have.

01:12:06.649 --> 01:12:07.638
Why?

01:12:07.850 --> 01:12:10.943
Why, because you think you Look
Like shit?

01:12:11.152 --> 01:12:14.144
I don't care about your burns,
if that's what they are.

01:12:14.356 --> 01:12:16.984
- Is that what they are?
- Yes.

01:12:17.192 --> 01:12:21.687
Okay, well, whatever happened to you,
you Look good to me.

01:12:26.302 --> 01:12:27.234
Well, you Look good to me too.

01:12:27.436 --> 01:12:29.495
Okay, so?

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.171
So I've never been here before.

01:12:35.777 --> 01:12:38.542
Okay, so you're scared.
I'm scared too.

01:12:38.781 --> 01:12:41.716
Listen, bad things have happened
to me, okay?

01:12:41.951 --> 01:12:45.011
I can't take my shirt off with a guy
without five beers...

01:12:45.221 --> 01:12:47.246
...but I want that with you.

01:12:47.456 --> 01:12:50.152
More than I'm scared, I want that.

01:13:04.173 --> 01:13:05.800
You don't see me.

01:13:08.312 --> 01:13:09.677
My Life....

01:13:13.817 --> 01:13:17.253
My Life is familiar. My Life is....

01:13:17.588 --> 01:13:19.055
It's manageable.

01:13:19.256 --> 01:13:22.020
It's manageable. Every day.

01:13:22.893 --> 01:13:25.055
I have a thing I do every day.

01:13:25.263 --> 01:13:26.992
It's all I've ever known.

01:13:27.198 --> 01:13:30.098
And it's a routine and as Long
as I have that...

01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:33.667
...as Long as I have that, I'm okay.

01:13:33.870 --> 01:13:35.599
If I don't have it, I'm Lost.

01:13:35.839 --> 01:13:39.537
So is that all you want?
Your goddamn manageable day?

01:13:39.744 --> 01:13:41.439
- It's what I have.
- It isn't.

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:44.273
- Is it what you want?
- Yes!

01:13:44.515 --> 01:13:45.948
I don't believe you.

01:13:51.222 --> 01:13:53.087
Okay. That's the best I got.

01:13:53.291 --> 01:13:54.953
- It's not about you.
- Yes, it is!

01:13:55.194 --> 01:13:58.856
Something's been offered to you here
and you don't want it.

01:13:59.063 --> 01:14:00.724
Maybe you're scared to get rejected.

01:14:00.932 --> 01:14:03.332
Well I can't reject you.
You're too quick for me.

01:14:29.428 --> 01:14:31.623
You didn't call me a fag, did you?

01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:38.095
Look what I found.

01:14:38.303 --> 01:14:40.635
Give me that! That's my asthma spray!

01:14:40.839 --> 01:14:43.206
- Shut up!
- Stop it!

01:14:43.410 --> 01:14:44.877
- Stay still!
- Stop! Help me!

01:14:45.078 --> 01:14:46.340
- Hold still!
- Stop!

01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:52.517
Hey, McKinney.

01:14:53.085 --> 01:14:54.017
Come here.

01:14:54.687 --> 01:14:56.177
Let's hang out.

01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:59.885
Help me, please.

01:15:00.093 --> 01:15:01.651
Screw it. Come on.

01:15:03.129 --> 01:15:05.063
Let me go! Let me go!

01:15:25.518 --> 01:15:27.213
You cut my class.

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.187
It's been four days.

01:15:32.727 --> 01:15:34.217
What's been four days?

01:15:35.329 --> 01:15:38.389
Why haven't you called my mother?
It's been four days.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:47.697
I don't know.

01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:51.944
Neither does she.

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:01.822
Hey, what's the matter?

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:09.493
Pay it forward didn't work.

01:16:10.665 --> 01:16:12.360
I couldn't even do it.

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.837
I was gonna help Adam.

01:16:24.946 --> 01:16:26.504
Help Adam do what?

01:16:27.716 --> 01:16:29.343
Not get beat up.

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:32.579
But I crapped out and I Let him.

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.353
I Let him get beat.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.556
No. you didn't.
You didn't Let him get beat.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:44.254
It happened.

01:16:45.033 --> 01:16:47.400
Sometimes there's nothing we can do.

01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:51.501
- It's not fair.
- I know--

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:54.437
No. You don't know.

01:16:56.212 --> 01:16:57.873
You should call my mother.

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.207
You could do something if you wanted.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:04.382
- Why are you chicken?
- I'm not chicken.

01:17:04.588 --> 01:17:07.250
Something's gonna happen,
then it'll be too Late.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:12.918
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

01:17:14.697 --> 01:17:16.130
He'll come back.

01:17:18.602 --> 01:17:20.092
Who will come back?

01:17:21.071 --> 01:17:22.800
Hey, who will come--?

01:17:28.812 --> 01:17:30.177
Your dad.

01:17:35.587 --> 01:17:37.486
Your dad will come back?

01:17:40.257 --> 01:17:41.246
And...

01:17:44.428 --> 01:17:47.329
...what will happen when he
comes back, Trevor?

01:17:51.002 --> 01:17:52.697
Will he hurt you?

01:17:58.877 --> 01:18:00.674
Will he hurt her?

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:09.315
Not if someone's there...

01:18:11.456 --> 01:18:13.117
...instead of him.

01:18:22.268 --> 01:18:23.360
Trevor, it's...

01:18:23.969 --> 01:18:26.870
...complicated for me now.

01:18:30.808 --> 01:18:33.276
Is the world just shit?

01:18:36.682 --> 01:18:38.582
No, it isn't.

01:18:42.221 --> 01:18:43.848
You did good work.

01:18:44.156 --> 01:18:46.522
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, Trevor.

01:18:46.892 --> 01:18:48.450
I'm proud of you.

01:18:52.565 --> 01:18:54.658
And anyway, for what it's worth...

01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:58.567
...I'm grading you on the effort,
not the result.

01:19:03.342 --> 01:19:05.242
I don't care about the grade.

01:19:20.260 --> 01:19:23.128
I just wanted to see if the world
would really change.

01:20:08.309 --> 01:20:09.572
Come in.

01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:09.064
Trevor!

01:22:09.867 --> 01:22:11.164
- It worked!
- Oh, God.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:18.165
- Does he always get up early?
- What?

01:22:18.376 --> 01:22:19.604
He just saw me.

01:22:19.811 --> 01:22:21.472
- It's okay.
- I'm his teacher.

01:22:21.713 --> 01:22:23.442
Now you have to pay it forward too.

01:22:23.648 --> 01:22:24.876
Eugene!

01:22:25.383 --> 01:22:27.351
You should still call me Mr. Simonet.

01:22:27.552 --> 01:22:28.712
You had a sleepover.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.047
- Go back to bed.
- Why?

01:22:30.256 --> 01:22:32.224
It's too early and I got to
get to school.

01:22:32.424 --> 01:22:34.915
- No, it's a Sunday.
- It's a Sunday?

01:22:35.127 --> 01:22:36.457
It's a Sunday?

01:22:36.661 --> 01:22:38.060
Stay. Mom will make breakfast.

01:22:38.263 --> 01:22:41.926
I have a schedule that you
don't know about every Sunday.

01:22:42.133 --> 01:22:44.499
Will you take care of him?
I'll call you Later.

01:22:44.736 --> 01:22:46.500
Don't be a stranger!

01:22:47.273 --> 01:22:48.171
You Like him?

01:24:12.994 --> 01:24:14.359
Lady, come on.

01:24:14.795 --> 01:24:15.784
Go away.

01:24:16.230 --> 01:24:18.460
I'm not going to hurt you, Lady.

01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:19.861
Here, take it.

01:24:20.068 --> 01:24:22.366
It's a nice thought
but it's not what I want.

01:24:24.606 --> 01:24:25.902
What are you doing?

01:24:26.107 --> 01:24:27.665
I'm not going to hurt you!

01:24:30.711 --> 01:24:33.111
Oh, my God. Listen to me.

01:24:33.748 --> 01:24:36.946
Nothing's this important.
Come down here.

01:24:37.185 --> 01:24:38.152
What are you doing?

01:24:38.353 --> 01:24:40.787
What do you care anyway?

01:24:41.023 --> 01:24:42.422
Because I owe somebody a favor.

01:24:43.258 --> 01:24:44.316
Not me.

01:24:44.526 --> 01:24:45.993
Why not you?

01:24:46.194 --> 01:24:48.719
You know, a minute ago...

01:24:48.930 --> 01:24:52.923
...all I could think about
was getting my next fix.

01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:57.629
And then I saw you
and I changed my thinking.

01:24:57.839 --> 01:25:00.137
Oh, please. Go away.

01:25:00.375 --> 01:25:02.468
Trust me. I'm not worth it.

01:25:02.978 --> 01:25:04.206
Why is that?

01:25:05.047 --> 01:25:06.913
- For God's sake.
- Come on, tell me.

01:25:07.116 --> 01:25:08.913
Why are you not worth it?

01:25:10.553 --> 01:25:14.114
Trust me. You wouldn't understand.

01:25:14.891 --> 01:25:18.156
Are you kidding me?
You think I Live at the Ritz?

01:25:21.898 --> 01:25:24.162
Have a cup of coffee with me.

01:25:26.235 --> 01:25:27.293
What?

01:25:35.244 --> 01:25:36.836
Do me a favor.

01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:41.011
Save my Life.

01:25:49.692 --> 01:25:51.717
Get him, get him! Off the ropes!

01:25:52.328 --> 01:25:53.728
He missed him!

01:25:54.998 --> 01:25:56.226
He's dead!

01:25:58.836 --> 01:26:01.066
Come on, bleed, dude.

01:26:01.872 --> 01:26:02.839
Give him a DDT.

01:26:03.741 --> 01:26:05.538
- What?
- It's gonna be a DDT.

01:26:05.743 --> 01:26:07.233
Drop him on his ass!

01:26:08.078 --> 01:26:10.172
I'm worried about you.
That's the DDT.

01:26:10.382 --> 01:26:11.314
- Hear me?
- He's dead!

01:26:11.516 --> 01:26:14.417
- He's paralyzed, get out of the ring.
- You can't get out of the ring.

01:26:14.619 --> 01:26:16.176
He can. He has to get a chair.

01:26:16.387 --> 01:26:18.821
A chair?

01:26:22.192 --> 01:26:23.022
Slow motion.

01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.530
Trevor, when did you become
so violent?

01:26:31.202 --> 01:26:34.262
Take me to a match. You get
splattered in the front row.

01:26:34.472 --> 01:26:35.734
I don't want to be splattered.

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:38.568
It'll be your
birthday present to me.

01:26:38.977 --> 01:26:42.174
You know what you're getting?
A new encyclopedia.

01:26:43.047 --> 01:26:44.014
Leather bound.

01:26:45.650 --> 01:26:48.483
Thucydides History of
the Peloponnesian War.

01:26:48.686 --> 01:26:51.314
No, I'm getting you 51
crackling volumes.

01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:55.893
There'll be pop quizzes every day on
the development of cotton farms.

01:26:56.095 --> 01:26:57.119
Hi, Arlene.

01:27:44.344 --> 01:27:45.971
You can't stay here, Ricky.

01:27:46.213 --> 01:27:47.407
I know.

01:27:48.548 --> 01:27:51.608
Look, I know what we had was
a nightmare, Arlene.

01:27:52.385 --> 01:27:54.910
- But I did it.
- You did what?

01:27:55.722 --> 01:27:58.954
I knew I couldn't come back
unless I was sober.

01:28:01.395 --> 01:28:02.919
It's the truth.

01:28:03.731 --> 01:28:07.928
Five months, two weeks and four days
are the truth.

01:28:09.402 --> 01:28:11.996
- Where you been?
- What does it matter?

01:28:12.239 --> 01:28:14.333
I knew I had to change.

01:28:15.243 --> 01:28:19.475
- Are you sober?
- Yeah, I got sober staying right here.

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:21.409
Well, you're stronger than me.

01:28:21.616 --> 01:28:23.607
Can you just stop for a minute?

01:28:24.151 --> 01:28:25.175
Please?

01:28:25.419 --> 01:28:28.013
Can we just sit down and talk?

01:29:47.504 --> 01:29:48.493
God.

01:29:48.706 --> 01:29:50.367
I'm sorry.

01:29:50.574 --> 01:29:51.734
What are you doing here?

01:29:52.076 --> 01:29:55.772
- I want you to understand.
- No explanation required.

01:29:55.979 --> 01:29:58.311
Please don't talk to me Like that.

01:29:58.948 --> 01:30:03.545
We had 13 years in, Eugene. He's sober
now. We've never been sober together.

01:30:03.821 --> 01:30:04.753
I wish you Luck.

01:30:04.955 --> 01:30:08.049
I feel Like I've got to
give him a chance.

01:30:08.258 --> 01:30:10.726
A chance? A chance for what?

01:30:11.395 --> 01:30:13.192
To change.

01:30:13.397 --> 01:30:15.524
To try to make up for Lost time.

01:30:15.733 --> 01:30:19.101
To take Trevor to ball games?
Do "daddy" things with him?

01:30:19.304 --> 01:30:21.794
Yeah, he promised to try.

01:30:22.006 --> 01:30:23.974
- What should I do?
- Be smart.

01:30:24.174 --> 01:30:25.607
He's his father.

01:30:25.809 --> 01:30:27.401
He impregnated you, Arlene.

01:30:27.611 --> 01:30:30.136
In what other way has he
been a father?

01:30:30.347 --> 01:30:33.316
Unless knocking somebody around
is a new family value.

01:30:33.517 --> 01:30:36.248
What do you mean?
He never touched Trevor.

01:30:36.554 --> 01:30:38.715
Oh, that's right, only you.

01:30:39.457 --> 01:30:42.915
He only took it out on you.
That's so much better.

01:30:46.264 --> 01:30:47.788
What did Trevor tell you?

01:30:47.998 --> 01:30:49.260
Enough.

01:30:50.101 --> 01:30:53.832
Secrets Like that shouldn't be kept.
What good does it do Trevor?

01:30:54.039 --> 01:30:56.337
Ricky never meant to hit me.
We were drunk!

01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:58.839
Christ!
What is it with women Like you?

01:30:59.544 --> 01:31:02.513
Is that something you tell yourself?
"It's okay he beat me."

01:31:02.714 --> 01:31:03.908
"Trevor's okay."

01:31:04.115 --> 01:31:07.552
Trevor Locked himself in a bathroom
and he can't breathe...

01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:09.948
...and he's praying that it will stop!

01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:13.556
- Trevor never went through that!
- You know what Trevor went through?

01:31:13.926 --> 01:31:15.290
How do you know?

01:31:15.527 --> 01:31:19.395
How do you know the next time after
you, he doesn't come for Trevor?

01:31:19.631 --> 01:31:21.862
I know what I'm talking about, Arlene.

01:31:22.068 --> 01:31:25.902
My father got on his knees
and begged my mother...

01:31:26.105 --> 01:31:29.233
...and my mother, she always
took him back.

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:30.602
I never understood it.

01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:34.610
She'd cover the bruises and the cuts
and she'd take him back...

01:31:35.514 --> 01:31:38.575
...because he begged and he cried.

01:31:39.052 --> 01:31:41.282
Ask me what happened after
he came back.

01:31:41.488 --> 01:31:44.388
You wanted to know what happened to me!
Now ask me!

01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:47.821
- I don't Like this.
- "Did he hurt you?" Ask!

01:31:49.261 --> 01:31:50.455
Did he hurt you?

01:31:51.497 --> 01:31:53.227
Not for Long.

01:31:53.433 --> 01:31:56.368
By 13 I was gone. I ran away.

01:31:56.570 --> 01:32:00.506
But I missed her, so I had to go back
and see her.

01:32:00.807 --> 01:32:02.638
So one night I did.

01:32:03.777 --> 01:32:07.474
Ask what happened. "What happened that
night you came back, Eugene?"

01:32:07.682 --> 01:32:08.614
What happened?

01:32:08.916 --> 01:32:11.713
He was there, drunk as usual.

01:32:11.918 --> 01:32:13.783
Only this time, I wasn't the same.

01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:18.287
I was 16 years old and I was no Longer
afraid of him.

01:32:18.525 --> 01:32:20.186
And when I Looked him in the eye...

01:32:20.427 --> 01:32:25.331
...and told him if he ever touched her
again, I would kill him, he knew.

01:32:25.633 --> 01:32:28.466
He knew that he would never exist
for me again.

01:32:30.138 --> 01:32:32.163
And I'm standing in front of the house.

01:32:32.373 --> 01:32:34.136
I'm screaming for her to come out.

01:32:34.342 --> 01:32:37.310
I'm telling her she doesn't have
to take it anymore.

01:32:37.511 --> 01:32:39.503
She doesn't.
She can come with me now.

01:32:39.714 --> 01:32:40.703
I don't see it coming.

01:32:40.948 --> 01:32:44.315
He hits my head with a two-by-four
and I'm bleeding from my ear.

01:32:44.519 --> 01:32:48.285
He's dragging me behind the house into
the garage. Then he's gone.

01:32:48.489 --> 01:32:50.457
A minute, five minutes, I don't know.

01:32:50.658 --> 01:32:54.618
Then he's back and wetting me down.
And I don't understand.

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:59.767
I don't understand why water
should smell so bad.

01:33:00.469 --> 01:33:03.632
I don't understand. And then I see it.

01:33:05.239 --> 01:33:06.729
I see...

01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:10.671
...this...

01:33:13.649 --> 01:33:15.412
...this gas can.

01:33:16.718 --> 01:33:19.983
This red gas can from his truck.

01:33:25.695 --> 01:33:28.562
And he Looks at me one Last time...

01:33:30.533 --> 01:33:32.432
...and he Lights a match.

01:33:36.839 --> 01:33:39.205
And the Last thing I remember...

01:33:39.842 --> 01:33:41.606
...and I'll never forget it...

01:33:41.845 --> 01:33:43.369
...were his eyes.

01:33:45.448 --> 01:33:48.417
His eyes, because they were
filled with this...

01:33:50.353 --> 01:33:52.082
...immense...

01:33:53.289 --> 01:33:55.189
...satisfaction.

01:33:59.095 --> 01:34:00.084
I'm so sorry.

01:34:00.363 --> 01:34:04.026
Don't tell me how sorry you
are for me!

01:34:04.968 --> 01:34:07.266
Tell me how you'll stop it
happening to Trevor.

01:34:07.470 --> 01:34:09.802
Ricky would never do that.

01:34:10.206 --> 01:34:13.267
Oh, Jesus, Arlene. He doesn't have to.

01:34:15.546 --> 01:34:17.707
All he has to do is not Love him.

01:35:35.061 --> 01:35:36.392
What's going on?

01:35:36.595 --> 01:35:39.325
What's going on?
I'll tell you what's going on.

01:35:39.565 --> 01:35:41.556
- What are you doing?
- What's it Look Like?

01:35:41.767 --> 01:35:42.631
You can't do this.

01:35:42.835 --> 01:35:45.633
What are you putting in my room?
We had an agreement.

01:35:46.974 --> 01:35:48.497
My son won't talk to me.

01:35:48.708 --> 01:35:51.575
He won't Look at me!
You turn him against me?

01:35:51.811 --> 01:35:54.712
I told you I wasn't gonna make him
talk to you.

01:35:55.414 --> 01:35:56.574
You could get a job.

01:35:56.816 --> 01:35:59.649
- What am I supposed to use for a car?
- Take the bus.

01:35:59.852 --> 01:36:01.319
That'll be the day.

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:04.423
- You can't stay in this room.
- This is our room.

01:36:04.624 --> 01:36:06.421
This is our house, our bed.

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:08.560
- You've been drinking.
- Kiss me.

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:13.322
Stop it! Stop it!
I want you out of this house.

01:36:15.535 --> 01:36:18.095
- What's your problem?
- I want you out.

01:36:20.874 --> 01:36:23.434
Turn that down!
I'll come and pound your ass!

01:36:23.643 --> 01:36:26.544
- Don't talk to him Like that!
- Don't tell me how to talk!

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:29.443
Don't tell me how to talk to anybody.
I've had enough.

01:36:29.649 --> 01:36:33.051
- Are you getting mad?
- What are you gonna do about it?

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:36.881
I Liked you better when you had
a few drinks in you.

01:36:38.292 --> 01:36:40.522
You want me out of the house, I'm out!

01:36:40.728 --> 01:36:42.059
Sorry.

01:36:47.734 --> 01:36:49.862
I think I made a mistake.

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:57.606
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:37:58.842 --> 01:38:00.207
All right, bring them up.

01:38:00.443 --> 01:38:02.775
Thank you. Carefully.

01:38:02.979 --> 01:38:04.446
Thank you.

01:38:05.114 --> 01:38:07.379
Careful. Did you get rid
of your hiccups?

01:38:07.884 --> 01:38:10.444
Told you holding your breath
would work.

01:38:10.887 --> 01:38:13.788
Thank you. Careful. Thank you.

01:38:16.626 --> 01:38:18.025
Very nice.

01:38:18.528 --> 01:38:21.190
Give me that one. Thank you.

01:38:22.500 --> 01:38:26.231
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:38:34.277 --> 01:38:35.744
Trevor, what is it?

01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.315
Are you still gonna pay it forward?

01:38:44.255 --> 01:38:46.223
You could say you don't have to...

01:38:48.192 --> 01:38:49.921
...because it didn't work out.

01:38:51.562 --> 01:38:53.463
But I thought you still might.

01:39:00.304 --> 01:39:04.263
Trevor, I would Like more than
anything to do that for you.

01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:09.574
- When I find something worthy--
- I know somebody who needs something.

01:39:10.749 --> 01:39:14.014
- You have to Let me find this--
- You know who it is.

01:39:16.655 --> 01:39:17.747
Look...

01:39:18.924 --> 01:39:22.416
...you don't understand everything.
All right?

01:39:22.627 --> 01:39:24.960
So you do not know what you're asking.

01:39:25.164 --> 01:39:27.427
Give her another chance.

01:39:30.835 --> 01:39:33.963
I will pay it forward.
I promise you that.

01:39:35.607 --> 01:39:37.541
But I cannot do that.

01:39:51.457 --> 01:39:53.721
But that's why this is the one.

01:39:55.293 --> 01:39:57.956
Because it's supposed to be
something hard.

01:40:01.534 --> 01:40:05.368
If you help my mom, even if you're
still mad, in a way nobody could--

01:40:05.571 --> 01:40:09.029
- Did she ask you to talk to me?
- No, she thinks you won't forgive her.

01:40:09.242 --> 01:40:11.176
But I still think you could.

01:40:13.714 --> 01:40:16.205
If you wanted to do something huge...

01:40:19.987 --> 01:40:21.453
...for someone...

01:40:22.989 --> 01:40:24.581
...for my project.

01:40:29.162 --> 01:40:30.527
For me.

01:40:37.037 --> 01:40:38.265
She made her choice.

01:40:38.472 --> 01:40:39.996
She said she made a mistake.

01:40:40.207 --> 01:40:42.368
Well, that's the beauty of hindsight.

01:41:00.328 --> 01:41:01.659
You don't care.

01:41:04.198 --> 01:41:05.756
Yes, I do.

01:41:06.934 --> 01:41:11.132
I will always care about you, always.

01:41:14.576 --> 01:41:15.838
Yeah.

01:41:17.378 --> 01:41:18.970
You're my teacher.

01:41:20.114 --> 01:41:21.843
They pay you to.

01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:12.633
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:42:16.806 --> 01:42:19.331
I ain't saying a thing till I
get one more.

01:42:19.542 --> 01:42:23.137
You know, I thought you might
feel that way.

01:42:27.851 --> 01:42:29.648
No, no. Later.

01:42:38.695 --> 01:42:40.663
I got my places.

01:42:41.364 --> 01:42:46.301
Places where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

01:42:48.739 --> 01:42:50.969
Places where I live.

01:42:52.343 --> 01:42:54.334
Anybody who knows me...

01:42:54.545 --> 01:42:57.514
...knows where to find me.

01:43:10.161 --> 01:43:11.389
Hi, Mom.

01:43:13.864 --> 01:43:17.391
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see you.

01:43:19.438 --> 01:43:24.171
- After three years, why now?
- I can't watch you do this.

01:43:27.979 --> 01:43:29.276
I drive by your house.

01:43:29.481 --> 01:43:30.880
I know.

01:43:32.883 --> 01:43:34.977
- He's big.
- Yeah.

01:43:38.123 --> 01:43:39.784
What are you doing here?

01:43:41.226 --> 01:43:43.854
Are you gonna try to put me
somewhere?

01:43:44.062 --> 01:43:45.359
No.

01:43:46.398 --> 01:43:48.127
Then what do you want?

01:43:49.234 --> 01:43:52.636
I want to try to do something.

01:43:56.976 --> 01:43:58.807
All the things...

01:44:00.011 --> 01:44:01.842
...when I was a kid.

01:44:03.682 --> 01:44:06.311
The booze...

01:44:07.253 --> 01:44:08.811
...and the men.

01:44:11.157 --> 01:44:13.648
What happened to me when you
weren't Looking.

01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:19.898
I know we're all weak.

01:44:20.666 --> 01:44:24.660
- No, not you.
- No, I've been weak.

01:44:28.574 --> 01:44:30.041
Here's the thing.

01:44:34.547 --> 01:44:36.242
I forgive you.

01:45:12.053 --> 01:45:15.250
- I don't Like your hair.
- I know. I'm not putting it back.

01:45:20.128 --> 01:45:24.121
So I'd Like to see you sometimes.
Is that okay?

01:45:26.901 --> 01:45:28.163
Yes.

01:45:30.071 --> 01:45:31.197
You can't Live with me.

01:45:34.909 --> 01:45:36.570
Who would want to?

01:45:39.113 --> 01:45:40.479
Can I see him?

01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:43.217
Not drunk.

01:45:43.419 --> 01:45:45.887
You've got to be sober if just
for two hours.

01:45:46.088 --> 01:45:47.919
Yeah, I can do that.

01:45:48.257 --> 01:45:49.518
Okay.

01:45:53.328 --> 01:45:55.092
Then I'll come and find you.

01:45:55.297 --> 01:45:56.491
Okay?

01:45:57.600 --> 01:45:58.862
Yeah.

01:46:00.002 --> 01:46:01.128
Okay.

01:46:02.037 --> 01:46:04.164
Why'd you do this, Arley?

01:46:10.279 --> 01:46:11.941
She told me why.

01:46:13.883 --> 01:46:17.374
She told me I had to do
something big...

01:46:18.687 --> 01:46:20.018
...for three other people.

01:46:20.222 --> 01:46:23.714
Happy birthday dear Trevor

01:46:24.059 --> 01:46:27.962
Happy birthday to you

01:46:28.164 --> 01:46:30.962
And many more

01:46:43.381 --> 01:46:45.314
What'd you wish for?

01:46:45.515 --> 01:46:47.983
He can't tell you or it
won't come true.

01:46:48.184 --> 01:46:49.344
Can I have some napkins?

01:46:49.552 --> 01:46:50.541
Here you go.

01:46:56.393 --> 01:46:57.520
I'll get it.

01:47:03.734 --> 01:47:04.894
Mom?

01:47:07.104 --> 01:47:11.199
I'm Chris Chandler. I'm a reporter.
Could I have a moment of your time?

01:47:11.408 --> 01:47:14.310
Why? I don't have anything to
say about anything.

01:47:14.545 --> 01:47:18.948
Please. I've already spoken to your
mother, which naturally led me to you.

01:47:19.150 --> 01:47:21.710
- My mother?
- She told me about pay it forward.

01:47:21.919 --> 01:47:24.114
How you helped her.
I'm doing a story.

01:47:24.321 --> 01:47:25.948
You can't. That's private.

01:47:26.657 --> 01:47:30.492
It upset my son. It was a social
studies thing and it didn't work.

01:47:30.729 --> 01:47:32.253
Social studies?

01:47:32.464 --> 01:47:35.456
Leave it alone. He just wants
to get on with seventh grade.

01:47:35.667 --> 01:47:37.897
It's his birthday and it's a bad time.

01:47:38.103 --> 01:47:40.502
- I'm sorry--
- No, I'm sorry.

01:47:40.738 --> 01:47:43.468
I've been tracking this story
from Los Angeles.

01:47:43.674 --> 01:47:46.041
Pay it Forward, the movement,
reached L.A.

01:47:46.244 --> 01:47:48.474
- Come on. The movement?
- Yeah.

01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.615
Your son had something to do
with this?

01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:05.894
I really appreciate this,
Mrs. McKinney.

01:48:06.098 --> 01:48:07.395
It's up to him.

01:48:08.967 --> 01:48:11.527
- Ready, slugger?
- I guess.

01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:13.567
Here you go. Up here, please.

01:48:13.772 --> 01:48:15.741
Just Like you're getting a haircut.

01:48:16.476 --> 01:48:18.808
- You been interviewed before?
- No.

01:48:21.714 --> 01:48:23.045
This is for you.

01:48:23.249 --> 01:48:24.238
Hi. How are you?

01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:27.942
- What's your name?
- Chris Chandler. Nice to meet you.

01:48:28.154 --> 01:48:31.488
Less painful than the dentist.
Just be yourself, okay?

01:48:31.725 --> 01:48:33.385
- Ready to go?
- I guess.

01:48:33.593 --> 01:48:36.255
Come on, you got to have
some gusto here.

01:48:36.462 --> 01:48:38.794
All right, Let's go.
All right, great.

01:48:39.232 --> 01:48:42.929
Just be yourself. Relax.
It's gonna be a Lot of fun.

01:48:49.176 --> 01:48:50.768
Okay, we're on?

01:48:52.346 --> 01:48:56.976
Hi, I'm Chris Chandler and I'm joined
today by an unusual seventh grader...

01:48:57.184 --> 01:48:58.742
...Trevor McKinney.

01:48:59.253 --> 01:49:01.243
Trevor, you must be pretty proud of
yourself.

01:49:01.454 --> 01:49:02.581
No.

01:49:04.258 --> 01:49:05.953
So you're not proud at all?

01:49:07.761 --> 01:49:09.752
I don't know. I guess.

01:49:09.963 --> 01:49:14.195
Come on, you start a movement Like Pay
it Forward. You're not proud?

01:49:14.802 --> 01:49:19.206
I guess. I mean, I got an "A"
in social studies.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:21.965
But that was just for the effort.

01:49:22.343 --> 01:49:24.208
Stuff I did, it didn't work out.

01:49:25.446 --> 01:49:27.845
- You're here.
- Yeah, but--

01:49:28.549 --> 01:49:31.017
I don't know. I tried real hard...

01:49:32.052 --> 01:49:33.680
...but nothing really happened.

01:49:34.522 --> 01:49:36.285
My mom's stuff worked.

01:49:36.491 --> 01:49:39.619
She talked to my grandma.
Kind of made up with her.

01:49:39.994 --> 01:49:41.791
It was really hard for her.

01:49:42.363 --> 01:49:46.060
It was great for me, because my
grandma came to my birthday party.

01:49:48.069 --> 01:49:49.697
And I had really missed her.

01:49:52.074 --> 01:49:54.736
And that's why Pay it Forward went to
all those places...

01:49:55.410 --> 01:49:56.604
...because of my mom.

01:49:57.745 --> 01:50:00.305
Because she was so brave.

01:50:00.915 --> 01:50:06.252
My stuff, I don't know. I think some
people are too scared or something...

01:50:06.689 --> 01:50:08.919
...to think things can be different.

01:50:13.362 --> 01:50:15.227
The world's not exactly...

01:50:16.632 --> 01:50:17.621
...shit.

01:50:20.704 --> 01:50:25.663
I guess it's hard for some people who
are used to things the way they are...

01:50:25.875 --> 01:50:27.502
...even if they're bad...

01:50:28.878 --> 01:50:30.277
...to change.

01:50:32.081 --> 01:50:33.776
And they kind of give up.

01:50:38.788 --> 01:50:40.881
When they do, everybody--

01:50:42.859 --> 01:50:44.383
They kind of Lose.

01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:13.450
Hi, Arlene.

01:51:16.594 --> 01:51:19.756
I don't want to be one of those people
he's talking about.

01:51:20.497 --> 01:51:22.226
And I've become one.

01:51:25.069 --> 01:51:27.765
I don't want to spend another
second of wasted air.

01:51:31.409 --> 01:51:34.071
Please don't Let me stay trapped
in here forever.

01:51:34.278 --> 01:51:35.506
I won't.

01:51:35.713 --> 01:51:38.410
I don't want to spend another second
without you.

01:51:51.729 --> 01:51:52.718
See you around.

01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:54.694
All right, see you Later, guys.

01:51:58.136 --> 01:51:59.125
Let me go!

01:51:59.338 --> 01:52:00.965
- Stop it!
- Who'd you tell?

01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:05.467
- Who'd you tell, tattletale?
- I didn't tell anybody.

01:52:08.814 --> 01:52:10.510
I didn't say anything.

01:52:10.717 --> 01:52:11.774
Help!

01:52:15.988 --> 01:52:18.479
Stop it! Trevor!

01:52:23.228 --> 01:52:24.422
Come here.

01:52:28.501 --> 01:52:29.490
Let me go!

01:52:29.936 --> 01:52:31.767
Cut it out! No!

01:52:34.374 --> 01:52:35.602
Get out of my face!

01:52:35.808 --> 01:52:37.400
Punch him! Come on!

01:52:38.011 --> 01:52:38.977
No!

01:52:40.278 --> 01:52:41.211
Leave him alone!

01:53:03.570 --> 01:53:05.504
Someone get an ambulance!

01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:03.491
I guess it's hard for
some people who...

01:54:03.698 --> 01:54:06.166
...are used to things
the way they are.

01:54:06.367 --> 01:54:08.232
...even if they're bad...

01:54:08.436 --> 01:54:09.698
...to change.

01:54:13.208 --> 01:54:14.870
I guess they kind of give up...

01:54:17.213 --> 01:54:18.680
...and when they do...

01:54:20.049 --> 01:54:23.541
...everybody kind of loses.

01:54:24.420 --> 01:54:27.253
These moments make you sorry
to report anything.

01:54:27.456 --> 01:54:30.914
This remarkable young man died
at 7: 35 this evening.

01:54:31.127 --> 01:54:35.962
There are now confirmed incidents of
Pay it Forward in L.A., San Francisco.

01:54:36.198 --> 01:54:37.722
In Phoenix, we're checking...

01:54:37.933 --> 01:54:40.766
...if the 16 foster children who
received computers...

01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:43.461
...is connected to this movement.

01:54:43.706 --> 01:54:44.968
It's hard.

01:54:45.207 --> 01:54:46.732
You can't plan it.

01:54:48.044 --> 01:54:51.070
You have to watch people more.

01:54:52.983 --> 01:54:56.418
Sort of keep an eye on them
to protect them...

01:54:58.754 --> 01:55:01.245
...because they can't always
see what they need.

01:55:04.427 --> 01:55:08.659
It's like your big chance to fix
something that's not like your bike.

01:55:16.673 --> 01:55:18.767
You can fix a person.

01:55:18.976 --> 01:55:22.468
Is that what you want for your
birthday, everybody to pay it forward?

01:55:22.846 --> 01:55:23.938
I can't ask for that.

01:55:24.147 --> 01:55:27.583
- Sure you can. Why not?
- Wouldn't work.

01:55:27.784 --> 01:55:29.081
Why?

01:55:36.494 --> 01:55:38.689
I already blew out my candles.

01:55:39.305 --> 01:55:45.605
