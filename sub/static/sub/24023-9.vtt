00:00.927 --> 00:02.413
Previously on Harrow...

00:02.460 --> 00:04.138
Our divers found a skull in the river.

00:04.453 --> 00:07.066
Turbot Street's confirmed it's
Robert Quinn. He was murdered.

00:07.126 --> 00:09.316
Do me a favour. Don't
mention this to Harrow.

00:09.376 --> 00:11.010
You have to check in on Mum.
-Doctor...

00:11.035 --> 00:12.056
My ex-wife is in there.

00:12.081 --> 00:13.131
Sir.
-I want to see her.

00:13.156 --> 00:14.532
You're gonna have to give me something.

00:14.568 --> 00:16.303
Why, are you gonna
arrest me for murder?

00:16.338 --> 00:20.017
The cops raided Steph's house
on your recommendation.

00:20.316 --> 00:21.820
What did you tell them?

00:21.889 --> 00:23.568
I do remember Quinn and
his blue Commodore.

00:23.619 --> 00:26.098
That you fitted two tyres to. Why?

00:26.236 --> 00:28.691
Someone hacked into the
sidewall with a screwdriver.

00:28.902 --> 00:30.424
Fern Harrow.

00:30.956 --> 00:34.435
No, that's Jack Twine.
Taught me everything I know.

00:34.682 --> 00:38.144
That rules are there
to be skirted around.

00:38.222 --> 00:42.141
So he knows all your
deepest, darkest secrets.

00:42.395 --> 00:43.871
Every single one of them.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:33.829 --> 01:35.269
Wha...?

02:33.069 --> 02:34.389
Come in.

02:35.756 --> 02:38.395
Jack, hi.
-Dass.

02:39.022 --> 02:40.555
Soroya.

02:40.616 --> 02:42.896
Join me for a nightcap?

02:46.616 --> 02:48.975
What day is it?
-Sunday.

02:49.355 --> 02:50.715
Absent friends.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.914
He doesn't know you're here, does he?

02:58.342 --> 02:59.977
No.

03:00.276 --> 03:02.103
You like him, don't you?

03:08.916 --> 03:10.236
I do too.

03:12.076 --> 03:15.293
Never had a boy. Or a girl.

03:17.084 --> 03:20.754
Pam and I tried but she couldn't.

03:21.162 --> 03:24.042
I wanted one. So much.

03:25.076 --> 03:27.189
So I was left with a choice.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.154
Leave her, remarry, make a mark.

03:30.242 --> 03:32.334
Leave a legacy.

03:32.482 --> 03:34.561
Or stay.

03:34.754 --> 03:36.475
And you stayed.
-I loved her.

03:36.913 --> 03:41.545
Despite that shortcoming that
some might have seen as a...

03:43.516 --> 03:48.061
..fatal flaw, I chose her.

03:48.922 --> 03:50.762
And you still left a legacy.

03:53.276 --> 03:56.650
What fatal flaw are you looking for?

04:00.762 --> 04:02.515
Would Daniel ever break the law?

04:02.716 --> 04:06.614
No, come on now, we'd all break
the law for the right reasons.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.555
Why?

04:08.626 --> 04:12.925
His ex-wife, Steph, her
husband was murdered.

04:13.196 --> 04:15.324
That Quinn bloke.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.115
You knew him?

04:17.188 --> 04:20.387
I know he fleeced Dan's ex
for half a million bucks.

04:22.036 --> 04:23.697
When did he die?

04:23.836 --> 04:25.836
October third, last year.

04:30.268 --> 04:33.915
And you're here to ask me what?

04:34.002 --> 04:35.882
Could Daniel have been involved?

04:37.202 --> 04:39.964
He is secretive.

04:40.676 --> 04:42.716
And you know his secrets.

04:43.716 --> 04:46.548
If he did something...

04:47.135 --> 04:50.065
..something wrong, I need to know.

04:51.429 --> 04:53.468
No wonder he likes you.

05:01.716 --> 05:03.636
It was nice to meet you, Jack.

05:49.028 --> 05:50.268
They found it.

05:53.236 --> 05:54.968
I woke up early this morning,

05:54.993 --> 05:58.152
wondering why Fairley and Pavich
were being so hush-hush.

05:58.616 --> 06:00.416
Now we know.

06:01.116 --> 06:02.995
Why didn't they tell us?

06:03.109 --> 06:05.974
It was me they didn't want to tell.

06:06.796 --> 06:08.964
Why not? What did they
think you were going to do?

06:09.022 --> 06:10.382
I don't know.

06:12.829 --> 06:14.949
I'm not sure I should be your boss.

06:16.196 --> 06:19.836
They don't trust me and you need
to learn from someone you can trust.

06:24.156 --> 06:25.819
Hello, Jack, are you OK?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.323
No, mate, I'm dead.

06:27.376 --> 06:30.587
I've decided to haunt you
through the mobile network.

06:31.156 --> 06:32.593
Are you busy?

06:34.522 --> 06:38.115
This is security footage taken
outside the Bowen Hills Racing Club,

06:38.140 --> 06:40.100
September 27th last year.

06:41.795 --> 06:45.666
As you can see, it shows Quinn's car.

06:45.996 --> 06:48.255
Both right side tyres slashed.

06:53.676 --> 06:56.381
So, we want to talk to Fern Harrow.

06:57.147 --> 07:00.820
Now here's some places you can
start. This is her mother's house.

07:01.155 --> 07:02.914
And that's her father's boat.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.777
But she's very comfy laying low.

07:04.843 --> 07:07.515
Does her mother know that Quinn's
remains have been ID'ed?

07:07.635 --> 07:08.715
No, not yet.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.808
What's the charge?

07:10.876 --> 07:12.575
Well, we just want to talk to her.

07:12.708 --> 07:16.187
But we are compiling a brief of
evidence for a charge of murder.

07:16.252 --> 07:19.370
Are you thinking that a
girl her size put a man

07:19.395 --> 07:20.914
like Quinn into the river alone?

07:21.092 --> 07:23.102
Well, at this stage,
Phil, we don't know.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.693
But I think we all have to
assume that she had some help.

07:27.835 --> 07:29.915
Her boyfriend, Callan Prowd.

07:30.622 --> 07:31.994
We all clear?

07:50.876 --> 07:52.130
Sergeant Dass.

07:52.202 --> 07:55.241
Hi, Soroya, it's Simon. Van Reyk?

07:55.716 --> 07:58.551
Hi, Simon Van Reyk. What's up?

07:58.996 --> 08:00.404
Can we catch up?

08:05.196 --> 08:08.472
I've given him a call.
-Hey, Jo.

08:08.675 --> 08:10.521
Dan, hi, do you need me?

08:10.595 --> 08:12.892
No, I'm just off to see Jack.
-OK.

08:29.535 --> 08:32.674
You mind? They're trying
to do a job here.

08:32.755 --> 08:33.845
They don't need spectators.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.705
It's OK, Jarred. He's a
friend of Jack Twine's.

08:44.076 --> 08:45.315
Jesus.

08:45.368 --> 08:46.888
Shoosh, you big dill.

08:47.882 --> 08:50.641
They still out there?
-Who?

08:50.796 --> 08:53.853
The gravediggers, taking
Stan Wagner away.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.975
Yeah. Is that why you called me?

08:57.276 --> 09:01.391
What'd you see?
-That, he was Catholic and dead.

09:01.715 --> 09:02.875
And?

09:02.957 --> 09:06.595
And there was some award,
fallen on the floor.

09:06.758 --> 09:09.235
Yeah. What'd Wagner
die of, do you know?

09:09.395 --> 09:11.915
Around here, excitement?

09:13.116 --> 09:15.809
That old bastard was as
fit as a pole dancer.

09:15.936 --> 09:17.619
And he had God on his side.

09:17.762 --> 09:19.401
He looked about 110.

09:19.596 --> 09:20.716
96.

09:20.837 --> 09:22.274
That's not a bad innings.

09:22.356 --> 09:24.075
That's not a good reason.

09:24.175 --> 09:26.855
Have you learnt anything
in the last 30 years?

09:28.836 --> 09:30.114
What are you thinking?

09:30.202 --> 09:31.881
Well, I'm thinking...

09:32.162 --> 09:34.134
..that it's worth thinking about.

09:48.175 --> 09:50.534
Look at that.

09:50.795 --> 09:53.524
10% body fat, lucky bastard.

09:53.796 --> 09:55.156
Anyway...

09:57.636 --> 09:59.813
Petechial haemorrhaging.

09:59.949 --> 10:01.509
Check his eyes.

10:05.076 --> 10:06.991
There's more here.

10:07.916 --> 10:09.727
But there could be any
number of reasons why...

10:09.822 --> 10:11.221
Check his throat.

10:11.609 --> 10:13.489
Didn't I teach you anything?

10:18.355 --> 10:19.675
Foam.

10:21.676 --> 10:23.797
Asphyxiation.
-Hey.

10:23.849 --> 10:25.128
What the hell are you two doing?

10:25.195 --> 10:26.634
We're just saying
goodbye to Stan.

10:26.715 --> 10:29.074
Bullshit, you didn't
even like the foreign prick.

10:29.156 --> 10:30.956
You are a nosy old bastard, Twine.

10:31.036 --> 10:33.136
Hey.
-Do you want me to get Jo?

10:33.212 --> 10:34.448
She's right there.

10:34.476 --> 10:36.618
She'd love to see how
you guys are interfering

10:36.643 --> 10:38.082
with a body of a dead resident.

10:38.316 --> 10:39.593
No?

10:39.836 --> 10:40.956
Take off.

10:44.835 --> 10:46.232
Charming fellow.

10:46.916 --> 10:48.747
Interesting reaction, though.

10:48.909 --> 10:50.748
Not enamoured of the elderly.

10:50.915 --> 10:52.475
Not enamoured of foreigners.

10:56.756 --> 10:59.890
Fern Harrow is a person of interest
in the murder of Robert Quinn.

10:59.956 --> 11:01.839
I want to check if Harrow
was working here

11:01.864 --> 11:03.574
on October the third last year,

11:03.607 --> 11:05.355
which is the date Robert Quinn

11:05.402 --> 11:08.015
made his last phone call and
his car went into the dam.

11:11.228 --> 11:12.526
What?

11:13.276 --> 11:15.286
This is ridiculous.

11:15.372 --> 11:17.079
You've known Harrow longer than I have.

11:17.116 --> 11:18.875
How can you entertain such a thought?

11:18.956 --> 11:20.715
Everyone has two sides, Max.

11:20.774 --> 11:23.426
What, even Fern?
-Well, it's Occam's Razor.

11:23.762 --> 11:25.601
You know, the principle
where the hypothesis

11:25.626 --> 11:26.807
with the fewest assumptions...

11:26.832 --> 11:30.110
Don't you dare explain Occam's
Law of Parsimony to me.

11:30.135 --> 11:32.085
Listen...
-Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

11:35.693 --> 11:40.483
OK, so Harrow carded in
at 9:32am on the third

11:40.602 --> 11:42.341
and carded out...

11:42.986 --> 11:45.157
at 3:19am on the fourth.

11:46.435 --> 11:48.674
Well, I guess he's in the clear, then.

11:51.355 --> 11:55.859
Hey, listen, have you given any
more thought to my proposal?

11:56.436 --> 11:59.196
Pick your moments, Bryan.
-Yeah, OK.

12:08.719 --> 12:11.275
Now remember, this young
doctor's a real stick in the mud,

12:11.316 --> 12:12.549
so hammer him.

12:12.642 --> 12:15.222
OK.
-Knock-knock.

12:15.825 --> 12:17.601
Jack, I'll get around to you shortly.

12:17.716 --> 12:20.395
Sorry to interrupt you, Doctor.

12:20.516 --> 12:22.555
Just my young friend
here can't help himself.

12:22.591 --> 12:24.635
He's got a couple of questions.

12:24.729 --> 12:26.169
I couldn't stop him.

12:27.836 --> 12:31.041
Daniel Harrow, Pathologist.

12:31.436 --> 12:34.115
I, er, wanted to ask about Stan Wagner.

12:34.216 --> 12:35.895
There's no need for
you to see Mr Wagner.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.649
He's going straight to
the School of Anatomy.

12:38.476 --> 12:39.915
He bequeathed his body?

12:39.976 --> 12:42.571
I have 23 more residents to
see this morning, Mr Harrow...

12:42.642 --> 12:44.606
Doctor Harrow.

12:45.415 --> 12:47.014
How did Mr Wagner die?

12:47.048 --> 12:48.488
Congestive heart failure.

12:53.749 --> 12:55.988
And what caused the heart failure?

12:56.076 --> 12:59.988
Myocarditis, previous
infarctions, thyroid disease?

13:00.069 --> 13:02.308
His blood pressure was low,
his cholesterol was high

13:02.336 --> 13:03.655
and he was old.

13:03.756 --> 13:06.124
It was my determination
that he died of heart failure.

13:06.235 --> 13:08.606
His son was also OK
with that determination.

13:08.909 --> 13:12.236
He had significant
haemorrhaging in his face...

13:12.267 --> 13:13.508
Wait.
-Eyes, mouth...

13:13.535 --> 13:14.695
You've seen the body?

13:14.896 --> 13:16.774
Sorry, Doctor, I couldn't stop him.

13:17.116 --> 13:19.791
Do I need to call Turbot Street and
ask why you're interrogating me,

13:19.816 --> 13:21.096
Doctor Harrow?

13:23.476 --> 13:24.783
Heart failure.

13:28.395 --> 13:31.925
One last question, where did he die?

13:31.982 --> 13:34.718
I saw the frame on the floor.
Was he on his way to the toilet?

13:34.802 --> 13:38.011
He was in bed when I was asked
to inspect his deceased remains.

13:38.756 --> 13:40.521
Maybe he knocked it
off on the way back.

13:40.676 --> 13:43.316
There is no need for an autopsy.

13:48.462 --> 13:50.798
Thank you so much for
backing me up in there.

13:50.902 --> 13:53.051
Well, he's my doctor.
I can't piss him off.

13:53.156 --> 13:54.764
But I can?

13:55.555 --> 13:57.686
Heart attack, my hairy white one.

13:58.516 --> 14:01.594
Wagner was active. He
ate like a starved dog.

14:01.716 --> 14:02.964
There was no fluid retention,

14:02.989 --> 14:05.668
no visceral congestion
that I ever heard.

14:05.716 --> 14:07.035
So what do you do want me to do?

14:07.062 --> 14:09.720
Break into the School of
Anatomy and examine his body?

14:21.215 --> 14:24.094
The eagle flies low at night.

14:24.716 --> 14:26.653
Why so secret squirrel?
-I don't know.

14:26.678 --> 14:29.559
I feel like secrecy is the
fashion of the day around here.

14:30.556 --> 14:33.476
They found Quinn's skull. Did you know?

14:34.422 --> 14:35.822
Yeah.

14:36.996 --> 14:39.956
And were you also part of the
"don't tell Harrow" conspiracy?

14:42.356 --> 14:43.968
Why? What'd you think
he was going to do?

14:43.993 --> 14:45.632
It wasn't my call.

14:45.722 --> 14:48.802
Yeah, but what do you think?
-I don't know.

14:53.076 --> 14:54.916
You think he was involved.

14:56.956 --> 15:01.196
No. No way.
-Simon. Maxine wants you.

15:03.436 --> 15:04.784
No way.

15:06.402 --> 15:09.611
You're the spreadsheet nerd.

15:09.722 --> 15:11.122
What does this mean?

15:13.356 --> 15:16.251
That's the staff entry logs.
-Yeah, yeah, but what are these?

15:16.349 --> 15:18.748
These asterisks. They're
only there on this day.

15:18.956 --> 15:20.755
Has someone fiddled with it?

15:20.816 --> 15:22.188
October third.

15:24.289 --> 15:27.331
Um, I don't know. Maybe
just computer error.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.285
Nothing.

15:29.522 --> 15:31.042
OK. Thank you.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.828
Actually, I don't have
a death certificate yet.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.715
That's why I'm ringing,
because I need to know

15:44.748 --> 15:47.134
what will happen if
he is declared dead.

15:47.996 --> 15:51.486
I think the police think
that he was killed.

15:51.542 --> 15:53.974
Homicide. Homicide.

15:56.711 --> 16:00.905
Yeah, I need to
call you back. Thanks.

16:01.596 --> 16:02.716
Hi.

16:02.814 --> 16:05.575
Is that what the cops think?
That Robert was murdered?

16:05.676 --> 16:06.815
I don't know.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.514
You seem pretty sure.
-Well, I'm not.

16:09.556 --> 16:12.417
I want to know.
-I don't know anything.

16:12.496 --> 16:14.348
Why did the cops search our house?

16:17.028 --> 16:18.408
Are you hungry?

16:19.722 --> 16:21.361
It was to do with Robert, wasn't it?

16:21.541 --> 16:23.523
Were... were they gonna arrest you?

16:23.595 --> 16:25.154
Please.

16:25.236 --> 16:26.531
You're not telling me everything.

16:26.596 --> 16:28.411
Well, I don't know anything else.

16:28.448 --> 16:30.008
So why the life insurance call?

16:31.076 --> 16:33.058
Honey, I...

16:33.811 --> 16:35.021
have to...

16:35.143 --> 16:36.216
Why do you want to
know all of this stuff?

16:36.240 --> 16:38.215
I want to know about Robert.
-Why?

16:38.316 --> 16:39.756
'Cause he hit you.

16:43.956 --> 16:45.916
And I know you went to hospital.

16:52.396 --> 16:54.036
I was OK.

16:55.676 --> 16:58.298
I don't trust that he
won't hurt you again.

16:59.196 --> 17:02.245
I need to know if Robert's dead or not.

17:05.994 --> 17:08.355
Can you just wait, please?
-Yep.

17:15.715 --> 17:16.958
Bryan.

17:17.055 --> 17:19.054
Hey, Steph, mind if we come in?

17:19.115 --> 17:20.499
I'd rather you didn't.

17:20.582 --> 17:23.142
Well, search warrant's
still valid, so...

17:24.122 --> 17:25.961
Just want to ask you a
couple more little things.

17:26.095 --> 17:28.414
Why, don't you think you were
thorough enough last time?

17:28.954 --> 17:30.635
So, what is it that
you want to know now?

17:30.714 --> 17:32.287
Where's Fern?
-Why?

17:32.356 --> 17:33.756
We'd like to talk to her.

17:34.956 --> 17:37.226
So would I.
-Where is she now?

17:37.436 --> 17:39.849
Northern New South Wales. She
went there with her boyfriend.

17:39.916 --> 17:41.368
That's, Callan Prowd?

17:42.596 --> 17:43.955
Yep.

17:44.435 --> 17:45.595
When?

17:46.509 --> 17:49.348
A week or so. Why, Bryan?

17:49.596 --> 17:51.795
How long has Fern known Mr Prowd for?

17:52.259 --> 17:54.425
I don't know. I only met him recently.

17:54.502 --> 17:56.822
There's nothing in there.

18:00.548 --> 18:01.628
How recently?

18:36.628 --> 18:37.628
Hi.

18:37.717 --> 18:41.649
I'm about to do
something slightly illegal.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.442
Wanna join?

18:46.148 --> 18:47.548
Hey, Grif.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.515
Perfect day, Doc. No-one
here but me, doing the prep.

18:51.733 --> 18:53.492
You doing any more
guest-lecturing next year?

18:53.596 --> 18:56.467
That's the plan, unless
something goes wrong.

18:58.782 --> 19:00.541
Are you ready for your end of terms?

19:00.619 --> 19:02.195
Peripheral neuropathy?

19:02.547 --> 19:04.555
I thought getting laid was hard.

19:04.649 --> 19:07.355
Read Struplan, fourth
edition. I'll text you a link.

19:07.728 --> 19:08.968
Thanks, Doc.

19:15.595 --> 19:18.155
Here, keep it. I got a spare.

19:18.302 --> 19:20.102
Thanks, Grif.

19:22.449 --> 19:24.528
You just trust him?
-It's Harrow.

19:24.609 --> 19:27.089
If you can't trust him,
then what's the point?

19:35.028 --> 19:36.298
What are we looking for?

19:36.349 --> 19:38.868
Well, the attending doctor
said natural causes.

19:39.242 --> 19:41.241
Jack thinks otherwise.

19:41.342 --> 19:44.366
Does Jack have any proof?
-Nope.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.745
So there's no crime
reported, no crime scene,

19:47.770 --> 19:49.240
no chain of evidence with this body,

19:49.265 --> 19:51.438
no formal commission to even be here.

19:51.496 --> 19:55.305
I'm technically on staff here.
Wagner was sent here.

19:55.835 --> 19:59.662
Look, I'm trying to help him.
Do you want to help me or not?

20:01.876 --> 20:03.155
Right.

20:03.312 --> 20:05.275
What are your first impressions?

20:05.329 --> 20:06.971
Good skin colour.

20:07.076 --> 20:10.004
Liver function probably OK.

20:11.415 --> 20:14.494
He's shattered his wrist.
Probably quite young.

20:14.596 --> 20:15.929
It's badly set.

20:16.076 --> 20:19.156
There's a mark on this wrist here.
Could be from a tight watch band.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.116
Yes.

20:26.595 --> 20:27.875
Here.

20:28.882 --> 20:33.281
Significant scarring. Burn, or acid.

20:33.369 --> 20:34.529
Very old.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.206
What do you make of his face?

20:40.316 --> 20:42.355
Mild cyanosis of the lips.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.957
Some broken blood vessels
on the cheek here.

20:46.937 --> 20:49.992
Petechial haemorrhaging. Anoxia?

20:50.278 --> 20:52.042
That's what we think, too.

20:52.836 --> 20:55.795
Well, a man of his age,
could be 100 causes.

20:55.920 --> 21:00.311
Jack was right. There's
no fluid retention.

21:00.622 --> 21:02.221
His renal system's fine.

21:02.246 --> 21:05.880
He's pretty healthy and there's
no clear bruises on his body

21:05.905 --> 21:07.024
that I can see.

21:07.156 --> 21:08.229
Right.

21:08.282 --> 21:09.442
Let's have a look.

21:19.373 --> 21:21.795
There's some lung froth back there.

21:21.946 --> 21:23.766
Not that much.

21:23.932 --> 21:25.092
There's a bit more haemorrhaging.

21:25.162 --> 21:27.449
Yeah, a coughing fit
could have caused that.

21:27.596 --> 21:29.076
Hello.

21:30.575 --> 21:33.735
That looks like a feather.

21:35.242 --> 21:36.557
You mean like a feather from a pillow?

21:36.582 --> 21:38.908
You think he was smothered?
-Possibly.

21:40.076 --> 21:41.981
Get these bloods tested.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.957
No need to tell anyone else.

21:51.182 --> 21:53.102
Yeah.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.649
Hey babe, I don't know
what you're selling, but...

21:59.716 --> 22:01.115
Daniel Harrow.

22:01.252 --> 22:04.195
That prick.
-Is my father.

22:04.238 --> 22:06.786
Did he find you?

22:06.916 --> 22:10.451
I need call records for this
number from October last year.

22:10.672 --> 22:13.155
I'm trying to find a missing person.

22:13.256 --> 22:15.816
And how will you be paying?
-Cash.

22:19.676 --> 22:21.659
Well, that's gonna cost about...
-$150 now.

22:21.684 --> 22:24.412
Another $250 when you deliver.

22:27.088 --> 22:28.928
I'll find you.

22:29.796 --> 22:32.707
Electrical burns to the
skin of thumb, forefinger

22:32.756 --> 22:34.529
and middle finger of the right hand.

22:42.356 --> 22:44.939
Hi.
-Come in.

22:46.270 --> 22:48.795
I'm not supposed to let you in
unless you're involved in the case.

22:48.949 --> 22:52.515
But, mum's the word,
though, shh, of course.

22:52.753 --> 22:54.730
Harrow's not the only
rebel around here.

22:54.876 --> 22:56.716
Hope you're OK if I continue my work?

22:56.741 --> 22:58.507
Someone here has to.
-Yeah, go.

22:58.609 --> 23:01.089
Sorry.

23:02.322 --> 23:03.561
Where is Harrow?

23:03.636 --> 23:06.308
Off tilting at
who knows what windmill

23:06.333 --> 23:08.380
instead of being here
during office hours.

23:08.488 --> 23:12.216
I know. He bends the rules.

23:12.469 --> 23:15.570
That's like saying James Blunt
has the occasional good tune.

23:21.676 --> 23:23.955
Does he ever bend them too far?

23:24.002 --> 23:25.002
What do you mean?

23:28.756 --> 23:30.276
Could he hurt someone?

23:32.136 --> 23:36.518
Harrow is capable of stupid things...

23:37.116 --> 23:38.658
but hurting someone?

23:39.466 --> 23:41.082
I can't see it.

23:52.016 --> 23:53.437
No cops?

23:53.876 --> 23:55.595
No girlfriends?

23:55.734 --> 23:57.751
Soroya.
-20 cops went through everything.

23:57.782 --> 24:00.181
My toiletry bags, my
bins, my wardrobe...

24:00.215 --> 24:01.694
Soroya was just trying
to find the truth.

24:01.722 --> 24:04.201
Well, it's not in my underwear drawer.

24:06.742 --> 24:08.228
What do you want, Daniel?

24:10.332 --> 24:13.632
Cops found a skull. In the river.

24:16.135 --> 24:17.175
Is it...?

24:26.269 --> 24:27.469
Was it you...?

24:29.885 --> 24:31.241
...who did the check?

24:31.316 --> 24:33.658
No. They're keeping me in the dark.

24:33.716 --> 24:37.115
So, why are they keeping me
in the dark? Robert was my husband.

24:37.186 --> 24:38.318
Look, why don't
I just come in for a bit...

24:38.342 --> 24:39.422
No.

24:41.196 --> 24:43.696
I'll talk to Nichols.
-No, he was right. It's...

24:43.989 --> 24:45.789
not your business.

24:47.075 --> 24:48.766
I need to be by myself.

24:58.796 --> 25:02.912
So, Callan, how long have you
known Fern Harrow for?

25:03.342 --> 25:05.142
Why do you wanna know?

25:06.202 --> 25:09.842
Do you, recognise this man?

25:11.556 --> 25:14.675
No, but I recognise the house.

25:14.762 --> 25:16.002
It's Fern's Mum's.

25:17.362 --> 25:19.162
Is that Fern's stepfather?

25:20.372 --> 25:21.823
When did you first meet Fern?

25:21.976 --> 25:24.457
What's this got to do
with her stepfather?

25:25.302 --> 25:27.505
Does Fern know I'm here?

25:27.808 --> 25:31.348
Well, I tell you what, why don't
you just unlock your phone,

25:31.769 --> 25:33.169
give her a call.

25:53.636 --> 25:54.915
Yes?
-Daniel Harrow.

25:55.085 --> 25:57.414
I'm a friend of Jack
Twine's down the hall.

25:57.554 --> 25:59.835
Michael Wagner.
-Sorry about your father.

25:59.953 --> 26:01.275
Did you know Dad?

26:01.553 --> 26:04.035
I rarely made it past Jack's room.

26:04.216 --> 26:06.318
Was your father happy here?

26:06.482 --> 26:08.561
I think Dad liked it everywhere,

26:08.608 --> 26:10.607
after what he went
through as a young man.

26:11.181 --> 26:13.195
During the war?

26:13.576 --> 26:14.915
Was he in Czechoslovakia?

26:15.313 --> 26:17.715
So he told me, a thousand times.

26:18.115 --> 26:20.036
Did he have any friends here?

26:20.436 --> 26:22.542
Not long ago, I heard there
was another resident arrived,

26:22.582 --> 26:23.815
also from eastern Europe.

26:23.862 --> 26:27.301
I thought Dad and her would
have a lot to talk about, but no.

26:27.356 --> 26:28.965
Do you know if there was anyone

26:28.990 --> 26:31.670
that might have wanted
to harm your father?

26:33.102 --> 26:35.702
Have you seen all his awards
for community service?

26:37.596 --> 26:39.995
Money?
-He gave it all away.

26:40.082 --> 26:41.122
I paid for all this.

26:42.742 --> 26:44.301
Hate?

26:44.388 --> 26:47.308
Why are you asking this? You a cop?

26:48.389 --> 26:50.105
I'm a pathologist.

26:54.836 --> 26:56.093
Dad's dead.

26:57.855 --> 26:59.471
Let him go.

27:05.043 --> 27:08.797
Who is the other resident?
The other eastern European?

27:13.276 --> 27:16.282
If you're going to complain, complain
in English, you miserable old Jew.

27:16.449 --> 27:18.601
I don't think she wants your help.

27:18.836 --> 27:20.715
I don't think that's your business.

27:20.782 --> 27:22.971
I'm getting Jo.
-No, you're not.

27:23.682 --> 27:25.321
You're Twine's little mate.

27:25.396 --> 27:28.115
Doctor Twine to you.
-You know what's funny?

27:28.423 --> 27:31.060
I found an oxycodone
wrapper in Twine's room,

27:31.302 --> 27:34.981
but I checked his charts
and he's not on oxy.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.918
Where'd he get that from, I wonder?

27:38.236 --> 27:41.141
Come on? You're English.

27:41.556 --> 27:44.283
You understand these people
bring nothing to our country.

27:46.076 --> 27:47.380
I'm Welsh, actually.

27:47.473 --> 27:51.196
Well, whatever you are, you're not
going to tell anyone about this.

27:51.916 --> 27:54.724
Unless you want to get banned
from visiting your little mate.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.235
You have a nice day.

28:03.796 --> 28:05.316
It's OK.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.652
Mrs Adams, isn't it?

28:09.142 --> 28:10.262
It's OK.

28:10.450 --> 28:12.409
Everything's going to be OK.

28:26.836 --> 28:28.759
Seriously, I've enjoyed all of this,

28:28.822 --> 28:32.861
but you either let me go or
you let me phone a lawyer.

28:33.193 --> 28:36.795
OK, in a sec. First, this.

28:36.955 --> 28:38.674
There's your phone.

28:39.201 --> 28:41.593
There's a search warrant
for your phone.

28:43.101 --> 28:44.340
What do you want?

28:44.628 --> 28:46.518
I want to talk to Fern Harrow.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.854
Why? She hasn't done anything wrong.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.555
Well then, there's nothing
to worry about, is there?

28:51.882 --> 28:54.658
I want you to give her a call
and ask her to meet you.

28:54.928 --> 28:56.607
Rat her out?

28:56.722 --> 28:59.561
Fuck off, man.

28:59.801 --> 29:02.634
Well, if you don't, Callan, we'll
find the number in the phone,

29:02.722 --> 29:05.362
we will track her down
and we will arrest her.

29:06.688 --> 29:09.367
Now we don't want that, do we,

29:09.522 --> 29:12.076
'cause we both know she'll
put up a bit of a fight.

29:12.842 --> 29:13.962
So...

29:16.129 --> 29:17.734
be smart, young fella.

29:32.734 --> 29:35.373
Cal, hi.
-Ditch your phone right now.

29:35.408 --> 29:37.248
The cops are looking for ya.

29:46.755 --> 29:48.514
Can I phone that lawyer now?

29:48.808 --> 29:50.088
You want a phone book?

30:15.788 --> 30:17.027
Callan?

30:17.128 --> 30:18.527
The cops are going to arrest Fern.

30:18.682 --> 30:20.205
Something about a guy named Quinn.

30:20.382 --> 30:22.049
Jesus.
-That's two for two now.

30:22.074 --> 30:23.474
You little shit.

30:46.768 --> 30:50.327
Daniel Harrow. I'm here to see
Senior Sergeant Bryan Nichols.

30:50.401 --> 30:51.995
Concerning?

30:52.494 --> 30:54.043
A current investigation.

31:11.708 --> 31:13.297
Sarge?

31:14.001 --> 31:15.530
What?
-He's not in his office.

31:15.555 --> 31:16.995
I'll try another number.

31:18.748 --> 31:21.405
So? Fern Harrow can't drive.

31:21.975 --> 31:24.814
Callan Prowd could have driven
Quinn's car into the dam.

31:24.922 --> 31:27.807
Here's the problem.
-What?

31:28.162 --> 31:29.409
Callan Prowd was arrested

31:29.434 --> 31:31.631
on the morning of October
the third for possession.

31:31.734 --> 31:34.053
He was released on a
surety on the fourth.

31:34.262 --> 31:37.827
Fern Harrow's seen here getting
cash sorted and on he fourth,

31:37.852 --> 31:39.311
filling out bail forms.

31:39.421 --> 31:41.581
All the time Quinn's car's
travelling to the dam.

31:50.155 --> 31:51.803
Task Force Helike.

31:54.001 --> 31:56.521
Sorry, Sergeant
Nichols just stepped out.

31:57.508 --> 31:58.868
I'll try his mobile.

32:04.014 --> 32:05.344
Get rid of him.

32:14.522 --> 32:15.722
Nichols.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.082
Sir, there's somebody down here
at the front desk to see you.

32:20.454 --> 32:22.893
A Mr Daniel Harrow.

32:23.533 --> 32:25.367
Well, what the bloody
hell does he want?

32:25.448 --> 32:27.326
I'll just ask. Excuse me Mr...

32:29.668 --> 32:33.257
And then I told them that Fern
was coming in with my bail money.

32:33.802 --> 32:36.281
10 minutes later, I was walking out.

32:36.441 --> 32:38.601
Are they still looking for Fern?

32:39.582 --> 32:40.993
What is this about?

32:42.521 --> 32:44.928
Who is Robert Quinn?

32:46.642 --> 32:49.270
Fern's stepfather. He's dead.

32:49.402 --> 32:53.189
He was killed. On that day, in October.

32:54.322 --> 32:56.081
Cops don't know who did it.

32:56.242 --> 32:58.685
Has this got anything to do
with why she's so messed up?

32:58.795 --> 32:59.875
Messed up?

33:03.025 --> 33:04.768
Messed up how?

33:08.258 --> 33:10.613
She's always looking over her shoulder.

33:11.561 --> 33:15.305
She jumps at nothing.
She's scared all the time.

33:20.588 --> 33:22.028
Did you hurt her?

33:24.674 --> 33:26.034
You really care about her.

33:33.522 --> 33:34.722
I hurt her.

33:36.762 --> 33:38.522
By not being there for her.

33:43.048 --> 33:47.747
I want 50 bucks on Kulu...
Kulu Queen, yeah.

33:47.908 --> 33:51.563
Yeah. Both to win,
but... Shit. Hang on.

33:53.108 --> 33:54.747
You got it?

33:54.841 --> 33:56.161
You got it?

34:08.541 --> 34:10.301
Yeah, I'm back.

34:12.368 --> 34:15.467
What's this number?
Last one he answered.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.053
I'm not Wikipedia, baby.

34:28.373 --> 34:31.212
That's a public telephone box.
-Do you know where it is?

34:33.022 --> 34:34.525
I can find out.

35:11.448 --> 35:14.041
Hey. You're here late.

35:14.122 --> 35:17.669
I got the bloods back from
your unofficial patient

35:17.694 --> 35:19.310
at the School of Anatomy.

35:19.603 --> 35:21.761
What did you learn?
-Not much.

35:21.821 --> 35:23.869
Blood type AB, no toxins.

35:24.682 --> 35:27.641
Racist arseholes?
-Freedom of speech.

35:27.801 --> 35:29.521
You think he killed Wagner?

35:30.442 --> 35:31.646
I don't know.

35:31.735 --> 35:34.695
What, because he was a
foreigner? A hate crime?

35:35.675 --> 35:38.954
I did see him being aggressive
with another resident.

35:39.168 --> 35:40.407
A Hungarian woman.

35:40.728 --> 35:42.321
A Holocaust survivor, actually.

35:42.428 --> 35:44.468
Really? How do you know?

35:45.288 --> 35:47.228
She had a number tattooed here.

35:47.268 --> 35:48.667
She was at a concentration camp?

35:48.708 --> 35:50.067
She was at Auschwitz.

35:50.242 --> 35:52.953
That was the only Nazi camp
that tattooed prisoners.

35:53.393 --> 35:55.644
Those they didn't send
straight to the gas chambers.

35:55.742 --> 35:57.785
And now this guy's abusing her?

35:58.428 --> 35:59.984
What a shithead.

36:01.668 --> 36:04.363
I guess the tattoos did
kind of point the way.

36:05.015 --> 36:07.575
Anyway. Sorry the bloods didn't help.

36:10.394 --> 36:11.767
Bloods.

36:13.082 --> 36:15.121
What? What is it?

36:15.428 --> 36:17.748
Blood type and tattoos.

36:22.215 --> 36:25.654
He had a scar, remember?
Wagner had a scar, right here.

36:25.682 --> 36:27.441
Yeah, it was an old burn.

36:27.535 --> 36:30.376
Exactly. He burnt off a tattoo.

36:38.555 --> 36:42.468
So Fern Harrow's no longer
a person of interest?

36:45.941 --> 36:49.101
No, so it's back to the crease.

36:50.282 --> 36:51.840
Robert Quinn?

36:52.801 --> 36:55.175
Made a lot of enemies.
More than I'll ever know.

36:57.201 --> 36:58.477
It's very late.

37:00.082 --> 37:01.202
Yes.

37:07.402 --> 37:08.602
Yes?

37:15.962 --> 37:17.042
Yes.

37:19.799 --> 37:21.562
And Geneva?

37:22.321 --> 37:23.481
No.

37:31.555 --> 37:34.314
No, Max. No...
-Yes. Yes.

37:34.401 --> 37:35.441
Alright.

37:44.682 --> 37:45.682
Jack?

37:48.642 --> 37:50.091
Jack?
-Jesus.

37:50.155 --> 37:51.674
Christ. Sorry.

37:51.962 --> 37:53.082
I'm still here.

37:55.602 --> 37:57.498
And you still care.

37:58.048 --> 37:59.278
Of course I do.

38:00.461 --> 38:02.060
Hop into bed?

38:02.141 --> 38:05.656
Look, you're sweet, but I'm
afraid I don't like loose men.

38:06.362 --> 38:07.933
Come on.

38:08.242 --> 38:12.034
Argh. Hang on.

38:13.634 --> 38:16.473
Afraid I didn't bring any oxys with me.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.513
That's OK. I'll cope.

38:28.442 --> 38:29.921
What have you learned?

38:30.055 --> 38:35.023
Well, that you're still the best
pathologist I have ever met.

38:35.202 --> 38:36.757
Crawler.

38:37.574 --> 38:38.973
Why?

38:39.121 --> 38:40.352
You were right.

38:41.322 --> 38:43.219
Wagner was murdered.

38:43.655 --> 38:46.045
That young redneck, Rallings?

38:47.434 --> 38:52.034
It was good though, wasn't it?

38:53.162 --> 38:55.085
Working together again?

38:55.748 --> 38:57.268
The best.

39:00.442 --> 39:01.883
Good student.

39:30.574 --> 39:31.894
Hi, Mrs Adams.

39:36.648 --> 39:38.888
But Adams wasn't your birth name.

39:43.407 --> 39:45.573
Did you marry into that name?

39:45.975 --> 39:48.721
Or did you change it
when you came here?

39:50.362 --> 39:51.761
Aszdy.

39:52.268 --> 39:54.268
Adams was easier.

39:56.482 --> 39:58.282
You were there.

39:59.655 --> 40:02.448
Auschwitz. And he was there, too.

40:02.602 --> 40:04.011
Stan Wagner.

40:04.228 --> 40:07.663
But that wasn't his
name either, was it?

40:08.082 --> 40:09.672
He had a tattoo as well.

40:09.842 --> 40:11.418
Only his was up here?

40:12.748 --> 40:15.707
I read that some cut
them out with knives.

40:15.928 --> 40:18.741
Some put a bullet through
the arm to disguise it.

40:19.058 --> 40:22.597
It looks like Wagner
burnt his off with acid.

40:23.174 --> 40:25.083
The tattoo of his blood type.

40:27.981 --> 40:30.741
His Nazi SS tattoo.

40:32.882 --> 40:34.562
I'm cold.

40:43.674 --> 40:48.764
I didn't think I would
ever feel cold again.

40:49.402 --> 40:52.247
The train was cold.

40:53.821 --> 40:55.021
Three days.

40:55.163 --> 40:56.569
No heat...

40:57.281 --> 41:00.401
except for the bodies
crammed around you.

41:02.308 --> 41:05.708
But they cooled when they died.

41:06.608 --> 41:11.058
And not even room for them to fall.

41:14.522 --> 41:16.962
My little sister and I...

41:18.602 --> 41:21.442
were together on that trip...

41:23.522 --> 41:27.042
surrounded by frozen dead.

41:27.882 --> 41:29.915
Then the train stopped.

41:30.402 --> 41:32.056
The doors opened.

41:33.002 --> 41:34.253
The noise.

41:34.308 --> 41:36.855
The dogs. The smell...

41:38.641 --> 41:40.641
of smoke.

41:42.775 --> 41:45.975
And he was there at the gate...

41:48.282 --> 41:51.442
at the desk, by the rail tracks...

41:55.002 --> 41:59.402
in his beautiful,
horrible SS uniform...

42:00.741 --> 42:05.580
with his handsome face
and his broken wrist,

42:05.976 --> 42:11.687
deciding who went that
way to the barracks,

42:11.995 --> 42:14.235
who went that way to the chimneys.

42:15.682 --> 42:17.962
He sent me to the barracks.

42:20.021 --> 42:21.538
Evike...

42:23.008 --> 42:26.048
he sent to the chimneys.

42:34.108 --> 42:39.006
For three months I saw that face...

42:41.088 --> 42:42.972
till the Russians came.

42:44.681 --> 42:47.480
They executed five of
the German officers.

42:48.262 --> 42:49.342
Hmph.

42:49.606 --> 42:50.821
He got away.

42:51.882 --> 42:54.260
Because he pretended to be Czech.

42:57.288 --> 43:02.487
Imagine how I felt when I saw his face,

43:02.860 --> 43:05.103
here in Australia.

43:05.308 --> 43:11.786
An article, with a photo
of him getting his award.

43:12.534 --> 43:16.574
For "Services to the
Hungarian Community."

43:18.282 --> 43:19.802
I couldn't believe it.

43:21.642 --> 43:24.961
So I sold my house,

43:25.328 --> 43:27.208
I moved in here...

43:29.082 --> 43:34.004
and I watched, and I waited.

43:34.762 --> 43:37.801
I found a feather in his throat.

43:38.176 --> 43:39.711
Was it a pillow?

43:39.808 --> 43:41.288
A cushion.

43:42.461 --> 43:45.101
I strapped his good arm down first.

43:50.748 --> 43:54.267
It's surprising how long it took.

43:54.442 --> 43:56.479
You would think I would know

43:56.562 --> 44:00.242
how long a person takes to suffocate.

44:04.455 --> 44:05.824
And his award?

44:17.661 --> 44:18.821
So.

44:19.742 --> 44:21.838
What will you do with me?

44:29.042 --> 44:30.202
Nothing.

44:48.624 --> 44:50.331
Are you warm enough now?

45:00.535 --> 45:04.264
That nurse. That young man.

45:05.981 --> 45:08.941
Have his car searched.

45:33.208 --> 45:35.744
No, no, no, no, no, is he breathing?

45:35.875 --> 45:38.350
Dan, I'm so sorry.

45:39.208 --> 45:40.864
Have you tried CPR? Try and revive him.

45:40.889 --> 45:41.933
Here, let me.
-No.

45:41.958 --> 45:44.126
Dan, no. He has a DNR.

45:44.453 --> 45:47.525
Do Not Resuscitate. You know that.

45:47.975 --> 45:49.225
Jack has a DNR.

46:29.182 --> 46:30.422
I'm sorry.

46:32.681 --> 46:34.640
Selfish bastard.

46:34.801 --> 46:37.641
He might have tidied up
a bit before he left.

46:40.722 --> 46:42.361
Who will it all go to?

46:43.474 --> 46:45.301
Me, apparently.

46:46.695 --> 46:50.404
I'll have it sent to work
until I can sort through it.

46:50.949 --> 46:52.950
I can stay if you want.

46:53.243 --> 46:54.912
The doctor still has to see him.

46:56.821 --> 46:57.991
OK.

47:00.288 --> 47:02.601
Well, call me if there's
anything I can do.

47:46.084 --> 47:48.643
Hello?
-Simon Venrik?

47:48.738 --> 47:51.276
It's Van Re... Yeah.

47:51.575 --> 47:53.414
Perse Hill Health Tech Support.

47:53.828 --> 47:56.994
I got your email about some
timesheets there at Turbot Street?

47:57.301 --> 48:01.140
The asterisks on October third?
-Um, the third, yeah.

48:01.255 --> 48:03.516
Yeah, you guys had an
outage late that night.

48:03.788 --> 48:06.187
Well, in the early am of the fourth.

48:06.402 --> 48:08.126
Your server dumped out for some reason.

48:08.242 --> 48:10.908
A server outage?
That... that's a first.

48:11.122 --> 48:14.336
Doctor Harrow phoned through all
the times, though, so it was OK.

48:17.682 --> 48:19.683
All the times?
-He's a helpful guy.

48:19.742 --> 48:22.382
Including his own?

48:53.275 --> 48:54.515
Oi, piss off.

48:57.814 --> 48:59.613
Drugs.

49:00.021 --> 49:02.082
No-one liked him anyway.

49:03.322 --> 49:06.563
Not like Jack. We all liked Jack.

49:07.101 --> 49:09.964
I don't know why Doctor Skarret
is insisting on an autopsy.

49:10.922 --> 49:12.682
He's just being thorough.

49:14.021 --> 49:15.276
We'll miss him.

49:16.562 --> 49:18.724
I'm glad your girlfriend
got to meet him.

49:20.628 --> 49:21.788
Pardon?

49:23.122 --> 49:25.615
The other night? The...
the woman, the cop.

49:25.835 --> 49:28.750
She said she was your girlfriend
when she came to see Jack.

49:29.801 --> 49:30.961
Pretty.

51:04.801 --> 51:06.440
Next on Harrow...

51:06.522 --> 51:08.967
That finger bone was cut
with a serrated blade.

51:09.014 --> 51:10.313
I've seen the kit on his boat.

51:10.403 --> 51:11.793
I want to organise a search warrant.

51:11.882 --> 51:13.546
Harrow visited the surgeon's widow.

51:13.594 --> 51:14.837
He left with a file.

51:14.888 --> 51:17.790
I'm thinking about all
the things that he did,

51:17.815 --> 51:19.774
when those bones first
came up from the river.

51:19.848 --> 51:22.567
Maybe he was just wrong.
-When is he ever that wrong?

51:22.642 --> 51:24.896
Do you really believe
he'd kill someone?

51:24.962 --> 51:26.681
I really need to find out.

51:27.057 --> 51:29.963
Hands, Harrow. Stay
right there, please.

51:30.041 --> 51:31.711
You have the right to remain silent.

51:31.775 --> 51:33.735
I imagine you have a few questions.
