01:20.040 --> 01:21.279
Where is he?

01:21.400 --> 01:23.719
2nd building on the left,
with the light on.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.079
Is he alone?

03:14.120 --> 03:16.799
GARAGE
NO PARKING

03:43.360 --> 03:44.639
Stay here.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.319
Adi...

04:01.600 --> 04:02.759
Adi...

04:07.560 --> 04:08.719
Adi...

04:10.520 --> 04:13.239
- Hey, Zlatko.
- Hey, Adi.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.399
Been looking for me?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.719
Come with me.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.359
What for?
To blackmail Milan, huh?

04:23.960 --> 04:27.679
- My brother's a good man.
- That's where you're wrong.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.519
I'm fed up with you people
thinking you're so powerful.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.119
We only think we're powerful?

04:36.360 --> 04:38.079
My poor Zlatko...

04:41.680 --> 04:44.159
You have no idea what power is.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.879
I love my brother.

06:40.400 --> 06:43.999
Milan, Dad doesn't like us
going so far away.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.759
But we can see everything.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.559
Ferid, my friend...

08:12.200 --> 08:13.799
Stop being a pain.
Why do you do that?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.959
- Listen to me.
- Why?

08:17.080 --> 08:20.239
Don't piss me off, we work together.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.959
I said, stay in the village.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.359
What's going on?

08:24.480 --> 08:25.959
Go home.

08:26.360 --> 08:27.759
Go on...

08:28.840 --> 08:29.679
Okay.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.279
- Why do you insist?
- I told you...

08:32.400 --> 08:34.159
Stop being a pain.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.799
I don't give a shit about aid work.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.279
You piss me off.

08:38.440 --> 08:41.319
I'm an idiot, is that it?
Go on, say it.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.199
Can I fire it?

12:01.360 --> 12:02.679
Wanna be a soldier?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.759
I'd make a good soldier.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.639
Maybe you will, one day.

12:16.720 --> 12:19.919
How's that girl?
What's her name?

12:21.160 --> 12:22.319
Naida.

12:23.280 --> 12:24.439
Going well?

12:26.200 --> 12:27.559
OK.

12:27.920 --> 12:29.079
Naida.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.439
Bora!

14:36.160 --> 14:37.639
Get the car ready!

15:03.680 --> 15:05.439
This shipment is for Marseille.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.079
We promised 5. We keep the rest.

25:39.040 --> 25:39.839
Here.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.679
I'm going to see Naida.

27:47.480 --> 27:49.119
Adnan.

27:49.240 --> 27:50.399
Go to bed.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.759
Come on, Ferid. Come on.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.399
Halt!

32:32.440 --> 32:33.599
Freeze!

32:43.840 --> 32:45.559
He's dead? Let's go.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.439
What have I done?
Fuck...

32:54.080 --> 32:55.759
Fuck...

35:46.280 --> 35:49.399
- Adnan, where's Milan?
- I don't know.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.119
We had to strike first.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.479
Dad, we had to do something.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.479
You've sentenced us all to death.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.999
I thought it was the right thing to do.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.239
Come on.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.439
Come on, let's go.

36:49.760 --> 36:50.879
Any others?

36:51.280 --> 36:53.599
- I'll check.
- It's OK.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.039
Let's go.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.359
Follow me!

37:13.320 --> 37:14.479
Ma'am.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.279
Pev.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.639
Pev.

38:01.080 --> 38:03.279
Guys! Come on!

38:03.880 --> 38:05.039
Halt!

38:06.520 --> 38:08.999
Halt!

38:10.360 --> 38:12.719
Halt! Get out!

38:12.840 --> 38:14.279
Are they ours?

38:15.200 --> 38:17.039
- Out!
- Come on!

38:27.280 --> 38:28.279
Go back!

39:53.520 --> 39:54.919
We'll have to push.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.199
Help me push.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.319
- Have they...?
- Yes, come on.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.719
- Are you sure?
- Yes, do what I do.

40:04.840 --> 40:07.919
Listen.
This is what we'll do.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.199
On the count of 3...

40:13.280 --> 40:16.919
Push as hard as you can.
Understand?

40:57.480 --> 40:58.639
Hurry.

41:00.680 --> 41:01.839
Hurry.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.599
Turn around.
Please, turn around.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.319
I said, turn around!

41:25.880 --> 41:27.799
Please, turn around.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.199
- We have to bury Dad.
- We can't.

41:36.520 --> 41:40.039
- They'll come back. We must go.
- Where?

41:43.200 --> 41:48.399
- To fucking Serbia.
- Serbia? But the Serbs killed Dad.

41:49.720 --> 41:50.879
Belgrade...

41:51.800 --> 41:56.119
We'll start a new life in Belgrade.
I'll look after you.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.319
Come on.
