WEBVTT

00:12.347 --> 00:15.517
Don't fight gravity, Shadow.
We're the coming thing.

00:16.851 --> 00:19.229
They threatened
to reprogram reality.

00:19.396 --> 00:21.147
Is that what this is?

00:21.314 --> 00:23.316
You are pretending

00:23.483 --> 00:25.819
you cannot believe
in impossible things.

00:28.530 --> 00:31.157
- Are you still my puppy?
- No.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.494
If all this is real,

00:34.661 --> 00:36.746
and TVs talk and hammers bleed,

00:36.913 --> 00:40.291
and if there's a world
under a world...

00:40.458 --> 00:42.460
We have no business with you.

00:44.170 --> 00:48.717
You say merger,
I hear war.

00:51.428 --> 00:53.138
I'm not your enemy.

03:52.775 --> 03:54.777
- Amen.
- Amen.

09:41.082 --> 09:43.376
What the hell was that in there?

09:43.542 --> 09:45.503
Marilyn Monroe just floats
into a fucking room,

09:45.670 --> 09:47.546
then massacred
a station full of cops

09:47.713 --> 09:49.757
and just left us
in the middle of it.

09:49.924 --> 09:52.009
And then I get stabbed by
Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.

09:52.176 --> 09:54.220
- What are they?
- It's hard to quantify.

09:54.387 --> 09:56.639
Motherfucker. You never
just answer a fucking question.

09:56.806 --> 09:58.557
It's not
a question, Shadow.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.727
A question would be,
"What do you believe you saw?"

10:01.894 --> 10:03.980
I don't know what I believe.

10:04.146 --> 10:05.731
They killed those cops.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.359
A warning to me,
a sacrifice to them.

10:09.402 --> 10:11.195
Sacrifice?

10:13.114 --> 10:14.991
Like what, f...for...for a god?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.160
What's a god?

10:18.327 --> 10:21.205
Can we even know they exist?

10:21.372 --> 10:24.125
People believe things,
which means they're real.

10:24.292 --> 10:26.252
That means we know they exist.

10:26.419 --> 10:29.714
So what came first, gods or
the people who believed in them?

10:32.133 --> 10:33.843
Alright, so...

10:34.885 --> 10:36.762
..where was all this
before I met you?

10:36.929 --> 10:41.350
On the periphery, just outside,
there's always a window,

10:41.517 --> 10:44.729
but people are frightened
to look through it.

10:44.895 --> 10:46.981
Safer in the prison cell.

10:47.148 --> 10:48.941
We're not safe now.

10:49.108 --> 10:50.818
No. We're not.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.406
Who are you?

10:57.783 --> 11:00.328
If I told you,
you wouldn't believe me.

11:03.998 --> 11:05.708
I believe in something.

11:06.876 --> 11:08.711
I saw my wife.

11:11.297 --> 11:13.090
Tonight.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.800
She, uh...

11:17.720 --> 11:20.097
She was waiting for me
in my room.

11:22.016 --> 11:25.770
She came back...alive.

11:25.936 --> 11:27.605
Dead.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.232
Oh?

11:35.446 --> 11:37.365
Well, your wife
obviously has a temper.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.159
Not used to
not getting her way, huh?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.663
Did she apologise
for her actions in life?

11:44.830 --> 11:46.332
Sort of.

11:46.499 --> 11:48.417
Your dearly departed
has departed,

11:48.584 --> 11:50.795
and I suggest we do the same.

11:55.383 --> 11:57.134
Maybe she's coming back.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.178
OK? Maybe we should wait.

11:59.345 --> 12:01.097
Maybe she was never here.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.140
Was she a ghost?

12:03.307 --> 12:05.226
I mean, do you think
you saw a ghost?

12:05.393 --> 12:09.146
No, because she was...
She was solid, OK?

12:09.313 --> 12:11.857
I touched her.
Sh...she....she kissed me.

12:12.024 --> 12:14.443
So your dead wife showed up.
You scared?

12:15.694 --> 12:17.279
Yeah, a little.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.409
You know, you're not
questioning any of this.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.285
I'm questioning everything
right now.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.540
I'm not so young nor so narrow
to assume that the dead are dead

12:27.706 --> 12:29.959
and there's no spectrum
of spectral in between.

12:30.126 --> 12:31.502
In my experience,

12:31.669 --> 12:34.380
the dead that aren't
rarely come back without purpose.

12:35.631 --> 12:37.216
I don't know
what her purpose was.

12:37.383 --> 12:39.760
To let you go.
Now get in.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.563
You've seen who's after us
and know what they're capable of.

12:50.729 --> 12:52.273
You can hang around here
if you want,

12:52.440 --> 12:54.024
but I'm getting out of here.

13:06.704 --> 13:08.873
Shadow!

13:11.333 --> 13:12.877
Fuck!

13:19.467 --> 13:21.469
Where the fuck is my car?

13:25.306 --> 13:26.849
Excuse me.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.644
Where's my fucking car?

13:30.811 --> 13:32.188
Police were looking at a car.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.023
They thought it belonged
to the dead woman.

13:34.190 --> 13:36.108
Yes, it does belong to the dead woman.
I am the dead woman.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.943
- Where's my fucking car?
- Police towed it.

13:38.110 --> 13:40.029
Where are the police?
Isn't this a crime scene?

13:40.196 --> 13:41.739
Shouldn't they be all over this?

13:41.906 --> 13:44.116
The police are dead.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.118
First piece of luck
I've had in days.

13:48.454 --> 13:50.289
Hi.

13:50.456 --> 13:52.875
Police are dead? All of them?
All of the police are dead?

13:53.042 --> 13:55.127
Worse things out tonight
than you.

13:56.170 --> 13:57.630
Do you have a car?

13:57.796 --> 13:59.798
Yes. I do.

13:59.965 --> 14:02.635
Well, chop-chop, Ginger Minge,
let's go.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.138
Isn't she lovely?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.184
- Which one's yours?
- Pick one.

14:10.351 --> 14:13.229
Oh, for fuck's sake! That one.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.238
Get it started.
I'll take it from there.

14:22.404 --> 14:25.032
You're not taking it anywhere,
dead wife, not without me,

14:25.199 --> 14:27.701
not until that coin is back
in my pocket where it belongs.

14:27.868 --> 14:31.038
Good fucking luck with that.
No, this one, not that one.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.375
That alarm
I can't do anything about.

14:34.542 --> 14:37.378
This alarm I can.
This alarm's my friend.

14:39.171 --> 14:41.298
Well, then steal me
a different fucking car!

14:41.465 --> 14:43.175
I don't want to drive
this shitty old taxi.

14:43.342 --> 14:45.553
I'm driving.
You're in the back.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.096
This car's a toilet.

14:47.263 --> 14:49.348
It's your toilet now,
dead wife.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.977
I've done the math.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.229
This times that
equals you're a cunt,

14:55.396 --> 14:57.398
divided by the only way
I'm going to get what I need

14:57.565 --> 14:59.483
is if you give it to me,
equals the only way

14:59.650 --> 15:02.486
you're going to give it to me
is if you don't need it.

15:02.653 --> 15:05.030
Like my friend Jesus Christ,

15:05.197 --> 15:08.325
the only thing you need,
dead wife...

15:10.869 --> 15:12.454
..is resurrection.

15:15.291 --> 15:17.209
Did you just name-drop
Jesus Christ

15:17.376 --> 15:19.253
like you know a guy
who knows a guy?

15:19.420 --> 15:21.213
I do know a guy who knows a guy,

15:21.380 --> 15:23.299
and the guy sitting next to that guy
is your guy.

15:23.465 --> 15:25.134
And who's this guy
your guy knows?

15:25.301 --> 15:26.844
Someone who can perform
a resurrection

15:27.011 --> 15:28.554
without the use
of a charmed coin.

15:28.721 --> 15:30.347
And you're just going to
convince this guy

15:30.514 --> 15:31.890
to bring me back to life?

15:32.057 --> 15:33.559
I can be very convincing.

15:33.726 --> 15:35.936
Ooh! Fuck!

15:36.103 --> 15:37.521
Is this you
being convincing now?

15:37.688 --> 15:39.064
Because you suck at it,

15:39.231 --> 15:41.150
unless you're trying to
convince me you're an asshole.

15:41.317 --> 15:43.110
I'm trying to convince you
to live.

15:43.277 --> 15:45.654
Real living,
not whatever rot living this is.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.615
'Cause whatever this is
doesn't last long,

15:47.781 --> 15:49.241
especially through a hot summer.

15:49.408 --> 15:51.493
Whatever this is goes to soup,

15:51.660 --> 15:54.038
and soup don't win
her husband back,

15:54.204 --> 15:56.123
if that's what soup is after.

15:56.290 --> 15:59.335
Why don't you put that on
your fucking scales and weigh it?

16:04.214 --> 16:05.966
What the fuck are you?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.636
I mean, what the fuck
are any of you?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.721
But first, tell me,
what the fuck are you?

16:10.888 --> 16:12.640
Seriously,
what the fuck are you?!

16:12.806 --> 16:15.684
- I'm a leprechaun.
- Oh, well, that makes sense.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.353
- Does it now?
- No!

16:21.732 --> 16:23.442
Please stop stealing my cab.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.197
Did you say
you are a leprechaun?

16:29.239 --> 16:30.741
Yes.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.827
Have you ever met a jinn?

16:37.414 --> 16:39.667
Looking for a jinn, are you now?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.877
I have been travelling in
the direction of Mecca for days

16:42.044 --> 16:43.462
looking for a jinn.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.548
Fire for eyes, shit for brains?

16:46.715 --> 16:47.633
Yes.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.720
And no, presumably.

16:59.061 --> 17:02.564
My luck's for shit.
I'd rather not be behind the wheel.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.358
- Good. I'll drive.
- Yeah. You'll drive.

17:04.525 --> 17:06.527
You'll drive into a fucking tree
first chance you get.

17:07.903 --> 17:11.115
Take us to Kentucky.
I'll tell you where to find your jinn.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.867
I'll tell you where to find
a whole murder of gods,

17:14.034 --> 17:16.704
demi and otherwise,
every goddamn one of them.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.747
I'll tell you.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.625
Once we're in Kentucky.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.761
You're confused.

17:32.928 --> 17:35.097
No, I can see that.
I can understand that.

17:35.264 --> 17:38.142
Usually when the grieving
reach the bargaining stage,

17:38.308 --> 17:39.768
they find that avenue fruitless

17:39.935 --> 17:41.520
and go straight on
to depression.

17:41.687 --> 17:44.440
But you...you've had
your fucking bargain

17:44.606 --> 17:47.234
and are loathe to go back
to grieving.

17:47.401 --> 17:48.777
Consider this.

17:48.944 --> 17:51.697
The dead, when they come back,
are tenacious little bastards

17:51.864 --> 17:55.367
and hang on until they're done,
and then they're gone.

17:55.534 --> 17:58.245
Hey! Hey!

17:58.412 --> 18:02.458
I know a charm that could lift grief
from a grieving heart.

18:03.500 --> 18:05.544
Do you know a charm
that can stop bleeding?

18:05.711 --> 18:07.421
No, I do, and I know a charm

18:07.588 --> 18:09.214
that can cure
your sickness and pain.

18:09.381 --> 18:12.217
I know a charm that can turn away
the weapons of enemies.

18:17.931 --> 18:21.727
I know a charm...
that can heal with a touch.

18:21.894 --> 18:24.688
Well, now would be
a good fuckin' time.

18:28.108 --> 18:31.403
- Oh...
- What? Is it infected?

18:31.570 --> 18:33.322
Well, in a way, yeah.

18:33.489 --> 18:35.657
No doubt you met gentlemen
in the slammer

18:35.824 --> 18:38.076
who slick their shiv with shit
before they shank their rival.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.997
Well, that's what we got here.
A shitty little shiv.

18:43.081 --> 18:45.000
It's moving!
What the fuck is that?!

18:46.043 --> 18:47.586
I need more light.

18:54.593 --> 18:56.929
Gonna take
a little persuasion, huh?

18:57.095 --> 18:59.515
Excuse the...the cold hands.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.100
Shh!

19:02.267 --> 19:03.811
Argh!

19:08.148 --> 19:10.859
Ever raise worms by putting
an electric current to the earth?

19:11.026 --> 19:12.611
That's what this is like.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.823
I feel it
digging around in there!

19:15.989 --> 19:20.077
Shhhhhhhhh!

19:20.244 --> 19:21.662
That's it.

19:21.829 --> 19:25.958
There's always been
a god-shaped hole in man's head.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.210
Trees were the first to fill it.

19:29.253 --> 19:30.754
Don't look.

19:30.921 --> 19:34.216
Mr Wood was the trees.
Mr Wood was the forest.

19:34.383 --> 19:37.302
He was a very old god
who saw something very new.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.137
He saw a god-fearing society

19:39.304 --> 19:41.598
turning towards
complete industrialisation.

19:41.765 --> 19:44.560
So...so what did he do?
He sacrificed his trees.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.311
He sacrificed his forest.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.815
And he became something else.

19:49.982 --> 19:52.317
Ohhh!

19:53.735 --> 19:55.362
Is it gone?

19:55.529 --> 19:57.030
Huh? What?

19:57.197 --> 19:58.782
At this stage, it's, uh...

19:58.949 --> 20:01.243
..it's "time will tell"
or "we'll see".

20:01.410 --> 20:04.872
But if it'll rest your weary head,
yeah, it's gone.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.458
It's all so fucked up.

20:08.625 --> 20:13.297
Religion inspires in those who
fear nothing, fear of the gods,

20:13.463 --> 20:17.426
and using that fear requires
a certain element of fucked up.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.856
New York scared me.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.774
I was scared
of the black people,

20:32.941 --> 20:34.484
the way they stared at me.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.362
I was scared of the Jews,
the ones dressed all in black

20:37.529 --> 20:40.115
with the hats and the beards
and the side curls.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.409
I was scared of
the sheer quantity of people,

20:42.576 --> 20:44.119
all shapes and sizes of people

20:44.286 --> 20:47.247
spilling from high, high filthy buildings
onto the sidewalk...

20:49.207 --> 20:51.126
I was scared of
the honking hullabaloo of traffic...

20:56.715 --> 20:58.342
I'm not scared
of anything anymore.

20:58.508 --> 21:00.052
I'm scared
you're never gonna shut

21:00.218 --> 21:01.678
that flappin' hole of yours.

21:01.845 --> 21:03.805
I'm sitting back here
having a fuckin' anxiety attack

21:03.972 --> 21:05.807
because I am genuinely terrified

21:05.974 --> 21:10.604
that you are never gonna
shut the fuck up, Ibrahim bin Irem.

21:10.771 --> 21:12.981
Who the fuck is
Ibrahim bin Irem, anyway?

21:13.148 --> 21:14.816
'Cause that ain't you.

21:14.983 --> 21:16.818
Ibrahim probably threw himself
from this speeding vehicle

21:16.985 --> 21:18.362
to shut your fuckin' yap.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.617
Did you kill Ibrahim?

21:23.784 --> 21:28.622
I won't tell. You should see
the shit I've done. Did you?

21:28.789 --> 21:30.290
No.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.709
I never met Ibrahim bin Irem.

21:34.503 --> 21:37.547
I imagine he was given
a new life just as I was.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.386
My name is Salim.

21:42.552 --> 21:45.597
Or...it was Salim.

21:47.265 --> 21:49.726
I do not know
what my name is now.

21:51.853 --> 21:56.191
So you got this new life.
What happens to the old one?

21:56.358 --> 21:58.443
Fuck those assholes?
Never see 'em again?

21:58.610 --> 22:02.239
Yes. Fuck those assholes.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.617
Yeah, that's the spirit.
Fuck those assholes.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.333
I just realised that I'm never
gonna never see my mother again.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.379
Never gonna hear her
say my name again.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.258
Never gonna eat
her cooking again.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.637
Thank fuckin' Christ for that.

22:25.804 --> 22:28.390
That is not me taking
the Lord's name in vain.

22:28.557 --> 22:30.100
I will actually be
thanking Christ

22:30.267 --> 22:32.728
when his Resurrection Guy
who-dos that voodoo.

22:32.894 --> 22:36.606
You shut the fuck up about that.
It's not for public consumption.

22:36.773 --> 22:38.942
You are not a leprechaun?

22:39.109 --> 22:41.153
Oh, she's a lepre-cunt.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.905
Oh, fuck!

22:44.072 --> 22:45.949
If I hear that word
pass your lips one more time,

22:46.116 --> 22:47.617
I'm gonna peel them off
your gums.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.495
Oh! Fuckin' hell!

22:50.662 --> 22:54.207
- Do you mind if I smoke in here?
- I would rather you not.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.876
You're really gonna be precious?

22:56.043 --> 22:58.295
Because it smells like someone
took a shit in the back seat.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.464
Someone did take a shit
in the back seat.

23:00.630 --> 23:03.091
If you must smoke,
roll down your window.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.363
Are you dead?

23:25.530 --> 23:27.574
You smell dead.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.702
Although, um,
that might be the cigarette.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.331
This is my afterlife,
Salim/Not Salim.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.502
Did you pray for another life?

23:38.668 --> 23:42.255
Oh, yeah.
All the time when I was little.

23:43.298 --> 23:45.342
At Sunday school,
we were forced to pray.

23:45.509 --> 23:47.803
I told my priest
that I didn't know how.

23:47.969 --> 23:49.846
And he told me to pray
for my family,

23:50.013 --> 23:52.891
so I used to pray
that they'd disappear.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.601
Or that there'd be an accident.

23:54.768 --> 23:57.354
There was an accident, alright.

23:58.396 --> 24:01.024
And now finally
my prayers have been answered.

24:02.818 --> 24:05.237
I do not pray
to ask God for things.

24:06.530 --> 24:09.658
I pray to thank God
for bringing me where I am.

24:09.825 --> 24:12.702
To this time, to this place,
where...

24:12.869 --> 24:15.247
I finally know what I must do
in this life.

24:17.874 --> 24:19.835
I pray I find the Jinn.

24:22.003 --> 24:23.880
He is my afterlife.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.925
I knew him.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.679
We knew each other.

24:33.598 --> 24:35.475
Now I want to know more.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.358
Did you have a genie
in your bottle?

24:44.734 --> 24:46.945
Did you rub one out of him,
darling?

Where is everyone?

27:32.861 --> 27:36.114
Everyone in this particular town
is a dedicated citizen.

27:36.281 --> 27:39.409
Dedicated to one sticky belief.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.411
America.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.497
Their America.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.550
There aren't
just two Americas.

27:55.717 --> 27:59.763
Everyone looks at Lady Liberty
and sees a different face.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.809
Even if it crumbles
under question.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.819
People will defend
the warm, safe feeling

28:14.986 --> 28:17.822
their America gives them.

28:17.989 --> 28:19.491
They will defend it...

28:20.533 --> 28:22.035
..with bullets.

28:22.202 --> 28:24.371
No, these streets
mean one of two things -

28:24.537 --> 28:26.122
radiation or...

28:26.289 --> 28:28.333
..something like this here.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.004
A funeral?

28:33.171 --> 28:35.548
Less a funeral
than a celebration of sacrifice.

28:35.715 --> 28:39.302
And if I know my friend,
someone got tossed into the volcano.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.022
This was a human sacrifice?

28:51.189 --> 28:53.024
Faulty railings at the forge.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.241
Couple times a year,
an employee takes the plunge.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.785
Insurance company says
it's cheaper to settle

29:03.952 --> 29:05.787
than to close down
and refurbish.

29:08.123 --> 29:10.500

29:39.404 --> 29:41.614
Vulcan.

29:41.781 --> 29:46.870
It may cost me a bottle of Soma,
but he'll join us.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.234
Please go in peace!

30:23.865 --> 30:25.700
Take a little cover
if I was you.

30:51.726 --> 30:53.478
Grimnir!

30:53.645 --> 30:57.690
Goodness, gracious,
great balls of fire!

30:57.857 --> 30:59.943
How are you, you proper geezer?

31:10.078 --> 31:11.996
What rock did you crawl out
from under?

31:12.163 --> 31:14.040
Oh, playing a little
hide and seek.

31:14.207 --> 31:17.043
Hiding from the proverbial "them"
and seeking you.

31:20.463 --> 31:22.173
What do you need from me,
Big Daddy?

31:22.340 --> 31:25.051
I need you...to believe in me.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.555
I always have.

31:31.849 --> 31:34.561
Oh, this is my man, Shadow Moon.

31:38.398 --> 31:39.691
Then it's true.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.901
What have you heard?

31:42.068 --> 31:44.237
I've heard your name
on the wind.

31:44.404 --> 31:47.532
You trying to start a war,
Glad-O-War?

31:47.699 --> 31:50.076
We're at war already,
and we're losing.

31:51.119 --> 31:54.956
You and me, all of us.
They're taking over America.

31:55.123 --> 31:57.208
They're taking honey
from our mouths.

31:58.251 --> 32:00.878
I'm not starving
for any taste of honey.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.590
The rest of us are.

32:04.632 --> 32:07.343
Then let's get you
something to eat.

32:13.516 --> 32:14.851
Hmm.

32:15.018 --> 32:17.186
Ohhh.

32:18.479 --> 32:20.898
This ain't Kentucky.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.650
Where's Kentucky?

32:38.541 --> 32:39.917
Whew.

32:40.084 --> 32:42.003
This ain't good lighting
for you, love.

32:42.170 --> 32:45.131
And a bang of benjy
coming off of you.

32:46.591 --> 32:48.676
- What can I get you?
- Southern Comfort and Coke.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.970
- Vodka straight.
- You have a preference?

32:51.137 --> 32:53.097
As close to rubbing alcohol
as you got.

32:53.264 --> 32:54.807
Coffee, please. Black.

32:54.974 --> 32:57.644
I'll bring it to your table.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.520
Find a dark corner downwind.

33:00.563 --> 33:02.148
Are you trying to shame me?

33:02.315 --> 33:04.942
That shit will blow up
in your face.

33:06.069 --> 33:09.030
Shame is the reason dead people
only go out at night.

33:10.114 --> 33:12.909
I have no use for shame.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.161
Shame,
I Dream of Genie,

33:15.328 --> 33:17.205
is what kept you
from gettin' tossed off a roof

33:17.372 --> 33:19.999
long enough
to make it to America.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.709
And what do you know
about dead people?

33:21.876 --> 33:23.795
Uh, I had a whole tutorial
with the Grim fuckin' Reaper,

33:23.961 --> 33:25.797
so I think I know
a thing or two.

33:27.090 --> 33:28.925
It's easier to pass for the living
in the dark,

33:29.092 --> 33:30.510
if I felt a need to pass.

33:30.677 --> 33:32.387
Only thing you're passin' for
is dead.

33:32.553 --> 33:34.138
- Good.
- Not good.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.973
You don't want to draw
any unnecessary attention

33:36.140 --> 33:37.016
to yourself.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.601
I think perhaps you don't want

33:38.768 --> 33:40.561
to draw any unnecessary
attention to myself.

33:40.728 --> 33:42.772
Because I have no shame.

33:42.939 --> 33:45.566
You're dead in Indiana,
dead wife.

33:45.733 --> 33:47.402
What are you doin' here?

33:47.568 --> 33:49.529
Homesick?

33:49.696 --> 33:51.948
Fuck those assholes, wasn't it?

33:52.115 --> 33:54.659
Now here you are
shovin' your face in 'em.

33:55.743 --> 33:58.663
Your heart's not beating for
this life anymore, dead wife.

33:58.830 --> 34:00.373
This life is done.

34:00.540 --> 34:03.793
Only felt my heart beat
one time since I died.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.461
When I kissed Shadow.

34:05.628 --> 34:08.256
That doesn't
obligate him to feel shit.

34:09.382 --> 34:11.008
You're so worried
about being alive,

34:11.175 --> 34:13.720
but to him, you're already dead.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.430
Wait.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.141
You kissed him?

34:19.350 --> 34:21.728
- Yeah, I just said I kissed him.
- Put your tongue in his mouth?

34:21.894 --> 34:23.396
- Just the tip.
- Was it cold?

34:23.563 --> 34:26.190
- And dry?
- Probably.

34:26.357 --> 34:28.151
Did it taste
like cigarettes and vomit?

34:28.317 --> 34:29.652
I had been smoking.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.782
Perhaps I misjudged the kiss.

34:34.949 --> 34:37.702
Probably should have had
some gum or a mint.

34:37.869 --> 34:40.037
Yeah, or a fuckin' Tic Tac.

34:40.204 --> 34:41.956
If your man had any doubts

34:42.123 --> 34:44.375
about whether his wife was
dead or not, that ended 'em.

34:44.542 --> 34:46.919
Death do us part.
Take the fuckin' hint.

34:47.086 --> 34:49.005
- What fuckin' hint?
- He's gone.

34:49.172 --> 34:50.631
Your man came, he saw ya,

34:50.798 --> 34:53.009
tasted death on your tongue,
and he left.

34:54.510 --> 34:57.346
He ain't your man anymore.

34:58.389 --> 35:01.726
He's Wednesday's man.
I saw him give it over.

35:01.893 --> 35:04.103
Right over there,
right at that table over there.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.897
That's where he took
his last glass

35:06.063 --> 35:07.774
of evil, vile fuckin' mead

35:07.940 --> 35:09.942
and made his bargain
with the devil himself.

35:10.109 --> 35:13.070
Your piece of shit husband
got a new life.

35:14.530 --> 35:16.115
Why don't you?

35:19.368 --> 35:21.037
This one got a new life.

35:21.204 --> 35:22.747
He ain't lookin' back.

35:22.914 --> 35:24.916
I did.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.335
And I'm not.

35:30.505 --> 35:32.840
Shadow made my heart beat again.

35:45.102 --> 35:48.481
Why do men like anal sex?

35:50.608 --> 35:52.735
'Cause women don't.

35:52.902 --> 35:55.154
Not like Ibrahim bin Irem
here does.

35:55.321 --> 35:56.906
He's got a button
for that business,

35:57.073 --> 35:58.699
so he likes gettin'
his backdoor kicked in.

35:58.866 --> 36:01.285
But your kind of love,
dead wife,

36:01.452 --> 36:04.497
is the grandest
butt fuckin' of 'em all.

36:04.664 --> 36:08.042
You can love somebody
even when you know they don't like it.

36:08.209 --> 36:11.838
Even when you know
they don't want it.

36:14.549 --> 36:17.969
That's some profound knowledge
for you right there.

36:18.135 --> 36:20.763
Wrapped up
in a quaint sexual metaphor.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.890
I don't know.

36:23.057 --> 36:24.934
I really like anal sex.

36:35.736 --> 36:38.030
It's an old
hanging tree.

36:39.073 --> 36:40.449
You like it?

36:43.369 --> 36:44.787
No.

36:49.125 --> 36:51.711
- Evening.
- Evening.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.339
Betty's getting
a spit polish.

36:55.506 --> 36:57.383
Stay as long as you like.
You'll be safe here.

36:57.550 --> 36:59.552
No, we really should get goin'.

36:59.719 --> 37:01.888
Nonsense. Nonsense!
You're gonna love it here.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.056
Everyone does.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.440
People do tend to behave
if they know they're being watched.

37:12.607 --> 37:14.233
They like being watched.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.818
Somebody's watching.

37:15.985 --> 37:18.195
Somebody's
always watching.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.493
What did you do
to become the god

37:24.660 --> 37:27.163
of this little universe
that you have created?

37:27.330 --> 37:30.708
Sacrifice.

37:33.336 --> 37:36.130
Come, please, sit, sit.
Have a drink.

37:45.014 --> 37:47.350
Ohhh.

37:47.516 --> 37:49.060
My Soma not good enough?

37:49.226 --> 37:51.604
Wine cellar
is overflowing these days.

37:54.482 --> 37:56.025
Not for you.

37:57.068 --> 37:58.361
Is he...?

38:02.782 --> 38:05.534
All this
from faulty railings, huh?

38:05.701 --> 38:07.912
Uh, you're no stranger
to sacrifice.

38:08.079 --> 38:09.956
Oh, they don't care enough
to sacrifice anymore.

38:10.122 --> 38:12.041
- Not to me.
- They could.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.794
If they don't,
you could sacrifice yourself.

38:16.796 --> 38:18.589
You've done it before.

38:18.756 --> 38:22.093
And the world
opened to me.

38:22.259 --> 38:25.346
It has since closed.

38:32.603 --> 38:35.481
You ever see a man hanged,
Shadow?

38:35.648 --> 38:39.610
Throat crushed,
gasping for life.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.363
Yeah.

38:42.530 --> 38:44.281
Well, then you'll know
that it's a terrible way

38:44.448 --> 38:45.950
to find your faith.

38:47.201 --> 38:50.913
Faith doesn't have to leave
the faithful...dangling.

38:54.417 --> 38:55.793
I franchised my faith.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.004
Franchised?

38:58.170 --> 38:59.755
You are what you worship.

38:59.922 --> 39:02.842
God of the volcano.

39:03.009 --> 39:04.468
Those who worship

39:04.635 --> 39:07.930
hold the volcano
in the palm of their hand.

39:16.063 --> 39:17.815
It's filled with prayers...

39:18.858 --> 39:20.609
..in my name.

39:20.776 --> 39:23.946
The power of fire is firepower.

39:24.113 --> 39:26.282
Not God.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.285
But god-like.

39:30.494 --> 39:32.621
And they believe.

39:32.788 --> 39:37.168
It fills their spirits
every time they pull the trigger.

39:37.334 --> 39:41.338
They feel my heat on their hip,
and it keeps them warm at night.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.357
God bless the believers.

40:03.110 --> 40:04.987
Come with me to Wisconsin.

40:05.154 --> 40:09.158
Stand with me and let the world
open to us once again.

40:22.421 --> 40:26.175
I was on the bus
before you painted it yellow.

40:26.342 --> 40:27.760
When do we leave?

40:27.927 --> 40:31.722
When you can forge me a blade
in the heat of your volcano.

40:31.889 --> 40:34.725
I need it on my hip
when we stand together.

40:39.188 --> 40:41.774
I'll make you a blade
worthy of a god.

40:41.941 --> 40:43.609
Hmm?

40:57.414 --> 40:59.125
You trust him?

41:06.132 --> 41:08.008
I know who he is.

41:08.175 --> 41:10.136
And who he's always been.

41:11.595 --> 41:13.389
I can depend on that.

41:14.765 --> 41:16.809
You tell him I was lynched?

41:20.187 --> 41:21.856
Didn't occur to me.

41:22.022 --> 41:23.941
'Cause he knew
that I was hanged from a tree.

41:24.108 --> 41:25.985
As do the ones
who hung you from a tree.

41:26.152 --> 41:30.781
OK, well, that's kind of
a personal fuck you to you.

41:30.948 --> 41:34.243
Oh, the personal fuck yous to me
didn't stop there.

41:35.411 --> 41:37.913
I've been thinking
of a personal fuck you retort,

41:38.080 --> 41:40.457
and my friend here
is gonna help me make it.

41:41.625 --> 41:43.544
You gonna tell me what it is?

41:43.711 --> 41:45.754
No, when you're ready.

41:45.921 --> 41:48.048
No, you're not here
at the moment.

41:48.215 --> 41:50.718
You're distracted. I wonder why.

41:52.553 --> 41:54.180
- Laura.
- Losing her twice?

41:54.346 --> 41:55.598
Mm-hm.

41:56.932 --> 41:58.475
When you think of her,

41:58.642 --> 42:01.187
does it open a window
in your mind, Shadow?

42:05.024 --> 42:07.151
Close your eyes.

42:10.696 --> 42:12.907
Can you see her?

42:13.949 --> 42:15.993
Where is she?

42:25.878 --> 42:27.254
She's in Indiana.

42:27.421 --> 42:28.797
Yeah.

42:28.964 --> 42:31.508
Outside
her mom's big house.

42:31.675 --> 42:34.178
She's out in the cold, but...

42:35.221 --> 42:37.139
..she doesn't feel it anymore.

42:38.182 --> 42:40.643
Or maybe that's all
she feels now.

42:41.685 --> 42:43.562
She's at the window, but...

42:45.105 --> 42:48.317
..her breath isn't fogging up
the glass at all.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.446
She's watching her family.

43:03.832 --> 43:05.626
They can't see her.

43:14.718 --> 43:17.137
But you can see her,
Shadow, can't you?

43:18.180 --> 43:19.640
Question is...

43:21.767 --> 43:24.228
..can you let her fade away?

43:52.047 --> 43:53.132
Drive.

43:53.299 --> 43:55.342
Fuck those assholes?

43:57.261 --> 43:59.179
Fuck those assholes.

44:45.809 --> 44:48.354
Your hands have lost
none of their skill.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.439
I should have given you a gun.

44:50.606 --> 44:52.524
You could carry that
on your hip.

44:52.691 --> 44:54.651
Machine-made arms?

44:54.818 --> 44:56.945
You used to do everything
by hand.

44:57.112 --> 45:00.783
Craft. Not manufacturing.
Now this, this is craft.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.826
You could cut
a line of throats

45:02.993 --> 45:04.453
with the best blade ever made

45:04.620 --> 45:06.205
from now until
your grandchildren died

45:06.372 --> 45:09.291
and not spill half the blood
a gun could in a day.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.796
They make blood sacrifices
to you.

45:13.962 --> 45:16.048
Blood spilled by bullets.

45:17.257 --> 45:19.676
You could use a blood sacrifice.

45:24.973 --> 45:27.935
Why are you doing
what you're doing?

45:28.102 --> 45:29.478
You got yours.

45:29.645 --> 45:31.980
I just want to make sure
everybody else gets theirs.

45:32.147 --> 45:34.525
Uh, it seems like
the right thing to do.

45:34.691 --> 45:37.236
For you.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.664
Did you tell 'em we were here?

45:55.671 --> 45:57.631
Yes.

45:58.966 --> 46:01.176
Are they coming?

46:05.180 --> 46:07.266
Oh, yes.

46:07.433 --> 46:09.393
You sold us out.

46:09.560 --> 46:12.604
Won't be joining us
in Wisconsin, then, huh?

46:12.771 --> 46:17.234
I've been advised
it's best if I appear neutral.

46:18.277 --> 46:20.737
Neutral,
in the face of injustice,

46:20.904 --> 46:22.906
is on the side of the oppressor.

46:23.073 --> 46:27.035
No, they...they're
not the oppressors.

46:27.202 --> 46:29.705
They're the tide.
They're gravity.

46:30.831 --> 46:33.459
You saw what I was.

46:34.501 --> 46:37.546
I was a story
people forgot to remember to tell.

46:39.381 --> 46:41.467
And they gave me a gun.

46:41.633 --> 46:44.136
They put power back in my hand,

46:44.303 --> 46:46.805
and I gotta tell ya,
it feels good.

46:48.390 --> 46:50.642
Every bullet fired
in a crowded movie theatre

46:50.809 --> 46:52.561
is a prayer in my name.

46:52.728 --> 46:55.898
And that prayer makes 'em
want to pray even harder.

46:58.025 --> 47:00.277
And that's how
you franchised your faith.

47:00.444 --> 47:02.821
I never needed my religion
to be moral.

47:02.988 --> 47:06.283
Moralising religions
or materialistic ones.

47:06.450 --> 47:07.826
They all need their martyrs.

47:07.993 --> 47:12.581
That's your role in all this.
A martyr.

47:12.748 --> 47:15.792
No. That's yours, my friend.

47:15.959 --> 47:19.046
You pledged allegiance to me
and forged a blade.

47:19.213 --> 47:22.299
And they killed you for it.

47:42.319 --> 47:45.864
Holy shit. Holy shit!

47:46.031 --> 47:47.491
What did you do?

47:47.658 --> 47:50.536
Oh, fuck, what did you do?

47:56.458 --> 47:58.001
What are you doing?

47:59.294 --> 48:01.338
I'm laying down a curse.

48:01.505 --> 48:06.051
I'm cursing
the whole fucking thing.

50:21.645 --> 50:25.273
Allahu Akbar. God is great.

50:27.484 --> 50:30.654
Life is great, Salim/Not Salim.

50:31.697 --> 50:33.365
Life is great.
