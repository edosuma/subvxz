00:01.818 --> 00:03.838
You took me. You took amanda!

00:03.848 --> 00:05.128
She won't remember a thing.

00:05.158 --> 00:06.888
You feeling ok?

00:06.918 --> 00:08.708
It's just this stupid
headache I've had all week.

00:08.728 --> 00:11.128
I hope I didn't embarrass
myself at the after party.

00:11.158 --> 00:12.698
You weren't at the after party.

00:12.728 --> 00:14.338
We were there. Weren't we?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.297
Are you going to make me ask you out?

00:16.338 --> 00:19.588
Your dad technically holds the
keys to my future in his hand.

00:19.598 --> 00:22.668
But I could ask him first.

00:22.698 --> 00:26.518
One hundred percent, absolutely
not, over my dead body, no!

00:27.018 --> 00:28.938
Sara just left?

00:28.958 --> 00:31.598
I would never do that to you.

00:32.137 --> 00:34.468
I know that.

00:34.478 --> 00:36.758
I want you to come home with me.

00:36.768 --> 00:38.858
You're gonna have to trust me.

00:39.458 --> 00:40.428
Ok.

00:40.438 --> 00:43.178
Did everything work
out the way you wanted?

00:43.188 --> 00:44.648
Exactly.

00:44.658 --> 00:46.778
******

00:46.788 --> 00:48.858
Amanda!

00:54.458 --> 00:59.198
After all was said and done,
it wasn't me who needed saving.

01:00.358 --> 01:02.598
It was jessi.

01:06.458 --> 01:08.948
Ok, you got plenty of room. Watch out!

01:08.958 --> 01:11.248
To the left.

01:11.788 --> 01:16.768
Good. Straighten it out.
Yes, you got it. Keep going.

01:17.318 --> 01:20.488
We can put a bed here,
maybe get her an armoire.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.818
Are you sure you want
to give up your space?

01:23.848 --> 01:25.918
Well, I don't have much choice.

01:25.928 --> 01:30.808
No, not unless you know a family dying
to adopt a teenager grown in a pod.

01:30.818 --> 01:33.038
It's the right thing to do.

01:33.068 --> 01:36.478
And it's gonna be ok, right?

01:37.018 --> 01:39.388
It's gonna be ok.

01:39.398 --> 01:40.928
This is so not ok.

01:40.948 --> 01:44.368
Right when I can finally put this
room to good use, I get a roommate.

01:45.418 --> 01:47.828
Will you look at the big picture here?

01:48.518 --> 01:52.828
Jessi, 24/7, it's in the house.

01:53.688 --> 01:55.138
We're so screwed.

01:55.148 --> 01:56.678
Try not screwed.

01:57.658 --> 01:59.058
What?

01:59.078 --> 02:03.158
For one thing, andy's out of town, and I thought
she said she was never having sex with you again.

02:03.168 --> 02:06.518
Oh, she'll change her tune.
Like she's gonna resist this.

02:09.118 --> 02:12.638
We're smart people. We can deal.

02:14.248 --> 02:16.548
It's gonna be ok.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:35.228 --> 02:36.968
Sorry.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.748
This is gonna be a disaster.

03:12.808 --> 03:17.168
The first time I met amanda, I was
drawn by the sound of her music.

03:18.118 --> 03:22.738
It was like her soul was calling
out to me and mine was answering.

03:22.748 --> 03:27.518
I never questioned what it meant,
this indefinable connection.

03:27.528 --> 03:31.178
I just knew she was the one.

03:32.218 --> 03:33.798
What should I do?

03:34.228 --> 03:35.328
What?

03:35.348 --> 03:36.688
Do I help cook?

03:36.698 --> 03:39.278
Jessi, your job is to eat.

03:39.288 --> 03:41.028
I don't eat eggs.

03:41.048 --> 03:43.788
- Um, you want a waffle?
- Ok.

03:43.798 --> 03:44.908
I'll take a waffle.

03:44.928 --> 03:46.658
Just eat your eggs.

03:46.678 --> 03:48.448
How'd you sleep, jessi?

03:48.868 --> 03:50.918
Good, I guess. It's a cot.

03:50.928 --> 03:52.088
At least you've got your own room.

03:52.098 --> 03:54.348
Give it up, josh.

03:59.718 --> 04:01.438
What's wrong?

04:01.768 --> 04:04.068
Nothing.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.268
Has anyone seen my cell?

04:06.278 --> 04:07.548
Did you check outside?

04:07.558 --> 04:10.748
Maybe you left it out there when
you were talking to mark last night.

04:10.758 --> 04:12.388
Mark? You were talking
to mark? I told you...

04:12.398 --> 04:15.488
- a different mark, dad.
- It better be.

04:15.498 --> 04:17.468
This different mark
must be really funny.

04:17.478 --> 04:19.618
You were giggling a lot.

04:19.628 --> 04:21.528
So, josh, when does andy get back?

04:21.538 --> 04:25.308
Not soon enough. Two more days,
and the wait is killing me.

04:25.588 --> 04:27.318
Is she gonna do it?

04:27.938 --> 04:30.018
Do what?

04:30.028 --> 04:33.908
You know, reopen the store and
be generous with the merchandise.

04:36.678 --> 04:38.988
That's what you said on the phone.

04:38.998 --> 04:40.678
You're like a human wiretap.

04:40.718 --> 04:43.888
I guess privacy in this
house is a thing of the past.

04:43.918 --> 04:45.568
Kyle's doing it, too.

04:45.578 --> 04:48.638
He's listening to amanda play right now.

04:50.178 --> 04:52.138
I'm sorry, what?

04:52.148 --> 04:54.868
You were listening to amanda.

04:55.168 --> 04:58.498
Except she stopped playing.

04:58.988 --> 05:00.248
You're right, she stopped.

05:00.278 --> 05:03.328
Amanda, you fainted.

05:03.618 --> 05:04.868
I'm calling 911.

05:04.908 --> 05:07.718
No, mom, please, I stood
up from the piano too fast.

05:07.748 --> 05:09.518
There's no reason for everyone to hover.

05:09.538 --> 05:12.448
Why now? Your audition is in two days.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.518
Is there anything I can get you?

05:14.568 --> 05:15.848
I'm gonna make you something to eat.

05:15.878 --> 05:17.218
I'm fine!

05:17.238 --> 05:20.088
She didn't have breakfast
this morning. No appetite.

05:20.098 --> 05:22.848
Something was upsetting her.

05:22.858 --> 05:24.678
Maybe it was you.

05:24.708 --> 05:26.908
How long are you going to
be staying with the tragers?

05:26.938 --> 05:28.808
As long as she wants to.

05:28.848 --> 05:31.748
It's turned into a regular orphanage.

05:34.978 --> 05:37.548
You look really pale.

05:38.888 --> 05:43.648
So, is this how it's gonna be now, the
two of you rushing over to protect me?

05:43.658 --> 05:46.648
Maybe we wouldn't have to if you were
capable of taking care of yourself.

05:46.678 --> 05:48.848
- I can take care of myself.
- I know that.

05:48.858 --> 05:52.288
Jessi, thanks. You can go home now.

05:52.578 --> 05:55.278
Yes, I'll go back to our house.

05:55.308 --> 05:57.718
I hope you feel better.

06:01.898 --> 06:04.118
- She means well.
- Does she?

06:04.468 --> 06:08.278
Honestly, kyle, I am preparing for
the most important concert of my life.

06:08.308 --> 06:09.558
The thought of you
two living together...

06:09.588 --> 06:10.998
it's not like that.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.368
She needs a place to live, a family.

06:13.398 --> 06:15.538
- I know...
- amanda.

06:15.858 --> 06:18.278
You're the only one for me.

06:18.288 --> 06:20.828
There's nothing to worry about.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.688
Now go home.

06:26.718 --> 06:28.248
Seriously, I have to practice.

06:28.278 --> 06:31.138
If I'm not absolutely perfect I
won't be able to win that scholarship,

06:31.148 --> 06:35.208
which, as my mom keeps reminding me,
is the only way I'm paying for college.

06:35.238 --> 06:36.788
Want me to stay and listen?

06:36.818 --> 06:40.038
You'll distract me. Go home.

06:59.438 --> 07:01.368
Amanda's concentration's just off.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.178
Don't worry, she'll get it back.

07:03.198 --> 07:05.458
I don't know. It's not like her.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.278
It's nerves.

07:08.388 --> 07:10.248
It happens to everybody. Trust me.

07:10.258 --> 07:13.128
Last year I couldn't hit an outside
shot for three straight games.

07:13.148 --> 07:15.658
Suddenly, I'm nailing every one.

07:16.658 --> 07:19.588
I just wish jessi could have
moved in after the concert.

07:19.608 --> 07:22.468
Oh, right, hottie in the house.

07:22.488 --> 07:23.978
Of course your
girlfriend's freaking out.

07:23.998 --> 07:27.638
I have to keep reassuring amanda while
trying to make jessi feel more comfortable.

07:28.488 --> 07:30.838
Sounds like a high-class
problem to me, dude.

07:30.848 --> 07:33.288
High-class? I want
them both to be happy.

07:33.298 --> 07:35.848
Sorry, I've got no advice when
it comes to managing women.

07:35.888 --> 07:38.688
I think my current
situation speaks for itself.

07:40.928 --> 07:44.618
So, is lori seeing that mark guy now?

07:44.628 --> 07:47.278
Stephen told her he was off limits.

07:47.678 --> 07:50.498
Like that's not gonna
drive her straight to him.

07:55.918 --> 07:58.598
- Hiya.
- Lori trager. What are you...

07:58.608 --> 08:01.368
are you slumming in college town now?

08:01.388 --> 08:03.738
I'm just passing through.

08:03.768 --> 08:05.038
Really?

08:05.058 --> 08:08.168
Sure. I mean, I know we're not
allowed to go out with each other,

08:08.178 --> 08:12.058
but as far as I know there's no
rule against accidental run-ins.

08:12.078 --> 08:13.748
Oh, is that what this is?

08:14.058 --> 08:17.438
A hundred percent purely
accidental run-in. Scout's honor.

08:17.448 --> 08:19.928
I don't know. Something tells
me you weren't a girl scout.

08:19.938 --> 08:21.998
Not even remotely.

08:22.028 --> 08:26.128
Well, um, it is nice,
accidentally running into you.

08:26.158 --> 08:28.498
Would you like to do
it again here tomorrow?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.668
See, now you're pushing it.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.308
Is that a yes?

08:33.928 --> 08:36.227
Well, it's not like you
can prevent an accident.

08:36.258 --> 08:38.607
- Do you want a ride?
- How about another game?

08:38.618 --> 08:41.717
They're both gonna be there, kyle,
no matter what time you get home.

08:43.347 --> 08:46.398
I'll walk. Thanks.

08:46.408 --> 08:48.448
Later.

08:55.418 --> 08:57.278
Somebody likes you.

08:59.598 --> 09:01.378
Here.

09:01.388 --> 09:04.018
What's wrong, not a
big fan of the canine?

09:04.308 --> 09:07.198
It's not the dog I have a problem with.

09:07.438 --> 09:10.378
Look, I want to apologize. Ok?

09:11.188 --> 09:13.728
We could have handled things
a lot better. I told him.

09:13.738 --> 09:19.158
I said, "if we want to make a good first
impression then abducting you and your girlfriend,

09:19.448 --> 09:22.008
probably not the best way to go."

09:22.018 --> 09:24.268
You're lucky no one called the police.

09:24.278 --> 09:26.498
Could have.

09:26.508 --> 09:31.118
Wouldn't have found anything. Our
membership is very exclusive. Careful.

09:31.808 --> 09:34.548
I'd like to keep things just between us.

09:36.838 --> 09:40.938
Kyle, hang on. Can we start over?

09:44.848 --> 09:47.078
Who are you?

09:47.108 --> 09:49.348
Michael cassidy.

09:49.398 --> 09:51.538
What do you want?

09:52.828 --> 09:57.238
Ok, to put it bluntly, you
are our greatest achievement.

09:57.258 --> 09:59.808
And we want to make sure we
have a relationship with you.

09:59.838 --> 10:02.768
A relationship to do what?

10:02.778 --> 10:05.748
Anything and everything.

10:05.768 --> 10:07.188
Come see what we are about.

10:07.218 --> 10:09.988
We are making state of the art
advances in science and technology.

10:09.998 --> 10:15.168
Right. A group of visionaries
and humanitarians. Scientists.

10:15.178 --> 10:17.628
No, mate. I don't have the smarts.

10:17.638 --> 10:19.798
I'm more of a front man.

10:19.818 --> 10:23.648
Scientists, terrible social skills.

10:23.658 --> 10:28.058
Anyway, they sent me to convince
you to give us a second chance.

10:28.078 --> 10:30.848
Let us show you we're the good guys.

10:33.078 --> 10:35.908
- I'm not interested.
- I'm hoping you'll change your mind.

10:39.668 --> 10:41.518
Humor me.

10:51.428 --> 10:53.388
Here, boy.

11:01.218 --> 11:04.958
You've been a very bad
girl, amber. Haven't you?

11:09.008 --> 11:09.928
Dad!

11:09.948 --> 11:11.528
What the hell are you doing?

11:11.548 --> 11:15.088
I mean, I know what you're doing
but what the hell are you doing?

11:15.138 --> 11:17.998
I'M... I'm sorry. I'm going crazy.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.298
Andy's been out of town
and you know, I miss her.

11:20.328 --> 11:23.968
I get that you miss your
girlfriend but this is not ok.

11:23.988 --> 11:27.398
When the bill for this program
comes in, you're paying for it.

11:27.408 --> 11:29.798
Is there a charge?

11:29.828 --> 11:32.818
I unscrambled the channel.

11:32.828 --> 11:34.508
Why would you do that?

11:34.528 --> 11:37.138
Josh asked me to.

11:37.148 --> 11:39.878
- Grounded for a week?
- Two.

11:43.778 --> 11:45.508
Nark.

11:52.808 --> 11:54.478
Dude, you gotta do
something about jessi.

11:54.498 --> 11:55.948
She can't keep a
secret for five minutes.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.108
She totally ratted me out to dad.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.278
She's not used to living with a family.

12:00.298 --> 12:01.948
Remember when I first moved in here?

12:01.968 --> 12:05.228
I told stephen I took that test
for you, but you forgave me.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.738
Give her time.

12:07.398 --> 12:09.288
Well...

12:09.368 --> 12:12.538
she did provide me with a
fairly excellent dose of porn.

12:13.278 --> 12:15.898
You really miss andy, don't you?

12:17.728 --> 12:19.408
I thought I was thirsty before.

12:19.428 --> 12:22.228
But now that I've had my first taste...

12:22.238 --> 12:25.588
with her gone, I'm totally dehydrated.

12:25.608 --> 12:28.748
So, andy's a drink that
doesn't quench your thirst?

12:28.768 --> 12:31.478
No, she does. She did.

12:31.488 --> 12:35.698
It's just... since we went there,
to that place, I'm going crazy.

12:35.708 --> 12:37.958
That's all I think about.

12:37.968 --> 12:40.208
You had that accidental run-in
with jessi in the bathroom.

12:40.228 --> 12:42.358
Why aren't you messed up?

12:42.388 --> 12:44.698
Why would I be messed up?

12:44.728 --> 12:48.628
You saw her boobs and
they're right downstairs.

12:50.088 --> 12:51.998
Both of them.

12:52.008 --> 12:54.868
I love amanda.

12:55.578 --> 12:58.398
She's my soul mate.

12:58.408 --> 13:00.708
Your soul mate? That's intense.

13:00.718 --> 13:03.128
I felt it from the first time I saw her.

13:03.158 --> 13:08.128
We just connected, as if we
were meant to meet each other.

13:08.138 --> 13:11.448
Amanda's always been the one for me.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.319
You still haven't gotten it right.

13:40.329 --> 13:43.149
Coming in every second isn't helping.

13:54.119 --> 13:57.199
Great. Broke a string.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.539
I keep messing up in the same place.

14:02.569 --> 14:05.639
It's like I can't hold the piece in
my head. That's never happened before.

14:05.649 --> 14:07.209
You'll get it. You always do.

14:07.219 --> 14:09.729
What if I don't? I
need this scholarship.

14:11.089 --> 14:12.879
Done.

14:13.429 --> 14:15.769
It's like I'm carrying this
stress in the back of my neck.

14:15.779 --> 14:18.379
Here, let me.

14:24.329 --> 14:26.779
- Feels good.
- Good.

14:28.419 --> 14:30.789
It's been one thing
after another lately.

14:30.799 --> 14:31.649
What do you mean?

14:31.669 --> 14:34.539
First the headaches,
now this pain in my neck.

14:34.559 --> 14:36.179
Forgetting my music...

14:36.209 --> 14:37.919
you're just nervous.

14:37.939 --> 14:40.119
I guess.

14:42.259 --> 14:44.699
You know, now that I
think about it, I just...

14:44.739 --> 14:47.699
haven't felt like myself since prom.

14:50.239 --> 14:52.239
We know that latnok sedated her.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.909
It must have been a very strong dose.

14:54.939 --> 14:58.469
So strong that she's still having
side effects two weeks later?

14:58.489 --> 15:00.179
Why is there pain in her neck?

15:00.189 --> 15:03.219
Stress? She's nervous about her concert.

15:03.229 --> 15:04.779
What if it's more than that?

15:04.799 --> 15:06.759
What if they did something to her?

15:06.779 --> 15:09.749
Kyle, I think you're being paranoid.

15:09.759 --> 15:12.249
They kidnapped us! It
was all a sick game.

15:12.259 --> 15:15.039
Who knows what else they're capable of?

15:15.359 --> 15:19.819
Let's say you're right,
they did something. Now what?

15:22.069 --> 15:24.839
Amanda keeps getting stuck at
the same place in her music.

15:24.859 --> 15:27.169
As if her memory's misfiring.

15:27.189 --> 15:29.539
It could be neurological.

15:29.599 --> 15:33.289
Well, it's not like you can
just scan her brain to find out.

15:35.199 --> 15:38.229
Ok. You could figure out a way.

15:38.239 --> 15:40.819
This never would have
happened if it weren't for me.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.749
I have to make sure she's all right.

15:45.539 --> 15:48.549
Anything for your precious amanda.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.069
Fancy meeting you here.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.099
What a wonderful coincidence.

16:02.479 --> 16:04.209
For me?

16:04.219 --> 16:07.609
I just like to keep them on hand
in case of accidental run-ins.

16:08.649 --> 16:11.189
That's so nice of you.

16:11.219 --> 16:13.499
Why do you sound so surprised?

16:13.529 --> 16:17.149
No, it's just, people don't
buy me flowers very often.

16:17.179 --> 16:19.939
Well, then you've been
dating the wrong people.

16:19.949 --> 16:23.929
I mean accidentally running
into the wrong people.

16:25.269 --> 16:27.529
We're really doing this, aren't we?

16:27.549 --> 16:30.029
I'm willing to take the risk.

16:30.039 --> 16:33.189
I mean, that's assuming
that you want to.

16:34.079 --> 16:38.509
I took three buses just to
get here. Of course I do.

16:39.979 --> 16:43.069
It's just never been this easy before.

16:43.089 --> 16:48.609
No games, it's so
direct. Just... honesty.

16:53.959 --> 16:56.609
Yeah, well... it's not easy.

16:57.459 --> 17:00.309
I mean, we're being bad. Secretive.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.929
Downright duplicitous.

17:01.939 --> 17:04.199
We are so evil.

17:04.559 --> 17:08.029
Would you care to be evil over pizza?

17:08.039 --> 17:10.589
I would love to.

17:18.719 --> 17:21.589
best accidental run-in ever.

17:31.399 --> 17:32.729
Is that what happened to my xbox?

17:32.759 --> 17:34.509
I needed to wire this controller.

17:34.539 --> 17:35.939
What do I get out of this deal?

17:35.969 --> 17:38.229
Knowing that you helped amanda.

17:38.239 --> 17:39.929
That's no reward for me, either.

17:39.959 --> 17:43.129
Do you see her? I need to install
this scanner under the piano.

17:43.139 --> 17:45.159
I don't want her to see us.

17:45.179 --> 17:48.259
Oh, yes, you know,
that would be terrible.

17:48.299 --> 17:49.569
Jessi, you wanted to help.

17:49.589 --> 17:50.859
I'm here, aren't I?

17:50.879 --> 17:53.459
Yo, amanda's next. Better
fire up that scanner thingy.

17:53.469 --> 17:55.309
Find a place backstage for the receiver.

17:55.339 --> 17:56.049
What should I do?

17:56.079 --> 17:58.399
- Make sure we don't get caught.
- Right.

18:01.309 --> 18:04.659
- Excuse me. Are you a performer?
- No.

18:04.669 --> 18:06.409
Performers only in the stage area.

18:06.439 --> 18:08.369
- But I'm just...
- who are you?

18:08.379 --> 18:11.019
I'm sorry, but you're not
allowed to be here. Please leave.

18:11.029 --> 18:13.839
Oh, my god! This is the wrong piece!

18:14.709 --> 18:18.669
This is tchaikovsky and I
wanted spandus strapopovich.

18:19.319 --> 18:23.549
Mother! Where are you? How could
you do this to me? I hate you!

18:23.559 --> 18:24.549
Young man...

18:24.559 --> 18:26.199
- are you in charge here?
- I am.

18:26.209 --> 18:27.869
This is completely unacceptable.

18:27.889 --> 18:30.069
You need to come with me.

18:32.929 --> 18:36.459
Kyle? What are you doing here?

18:38.789 --> 18:40.649
Wishing you luck.

18:40.689 --> 18:43.819
It's a closed rehearsal.
And I need to focus.

18:44.349 --> 18:47.979
Ok. Well, then, good luck.

19:21.279 --> 19:23.529
The device is working perfectly.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.769
Great.

19:28.329 --> 19:30.489
We make a good team.

19:30.509 --> 19:32.869
Thanks for helping.

19:58.115 --> 19:59.095
Leave me alone.

19:59.145 --> 20:00.605
Amanda, I just want to help.

20:00.645 --> 20:02.295
By showing up with your housemate?

20:02.325 --> 20:04.395
You know how that makes
me feel, especially now.

20:04.425 --> 20:05.435
I shouldn't have brought her.

20:05.465 --> 20:06.635
No, you shouldn't have.

20:06.705 --> 20:09.355
But somehow, she's
always around, helping.

20:11.065 --> 20:12.725
Let me ask you something.

20:12.735 --> 20:13.835
What?

20:13.865 --> 20:17.065
That night, after prom, when
you went looking for me...

20:17.075 --> 20:18.305
yes?

20:18.335 --> 20:19.855
Was jessi there?

20:19.865 --> 20:22.295
- Why would you think...
- just answer the question.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.295
Jessi helped me find you, yes.

20:26.345 --> 20:27.625
I knew it.

20:27.635 --> 20:29.955
Look, I know that night
must seem very strange.

20:29.975 --> 20:31.235
Strange?

20:31.255 --> 20:34.995
It's this big giant question mark, and now that
I know she was there it makes it all even worse.

20:35.005 --> 20:36.635
Wherever you go, she goes.

20:36.665 --> 20:39.255
- I know it may seem that way...
- no, that's how it is!

20:39.265 --> 20:41.275
And honestly, kyle, I can't take it!

20:41.315 --> 20:44.075
I've got to nail this audition
and I can't be worrying about

20:44.085 --> 20:46.875
what is and what is not going on
with the two of you all the time.

20:46.895 --> 20:48.815
- I just can't!
- There's nothing going on.

20:48.825 --> 20:51.385
Then maybe you could try not
spending every second with her!

20:51.405 --> 20:53.805
See how that goes.

21:15.395 --> 21:18.395
Oh, cool. You got it to read
the data from the rehearsal.

21:18.405 --> 21:21.145
This is all of amanda's brain activity.

21:21.155 --> 21:23.785
- Were you up all night?
- Not all night.

21:23.795 --> 21:25.465
Maybe most of it.

21:25.495 --> 21:28.175
You know, you could
have used your computer.

21:28.255 --> 21:30.075
It wouldn't have bothered me.

21:30.115 --> 21:32.215
This one's fine.

21:33.695 --> 21:36.565
well, call out the numbers.
I'll input them in the program.

21:37.225 --> 21:39.115
I should do this by myself.

21:39.935 --> 21:41.635
Why?

21:41.665 --> 21:47.275
Just, maybe you should go see
what everybody else is up to.

21:48.285 --> 21:50.875
It's amanda, right?

21:50.895 --> 21:52.585
She hates me.

21:52.595 --> 21:54.315
She doesn't hate you.

21:54.325 --> 21:56.475
She just thinks that we
spend too much time together.

21:56.485 --> 21:57.935
I've only been trying to help.

21:57.965 --> 21:59.505
I know.

21:59.535 --> 22:02.745
But she doesn't know the real
story, so it looks different to her.

22:04.235 --> 22:08.365
It must be hard, being with someone
when you have to keep so many secrets.

22:09.045 --> 22:12.035
It is. I wish I could
tell her everything.

22:12.845 --> 22:15.085
Then why don't you?

22:15.095 --> 22:17.295
I think about how worried she'd be.

22:17.315 --> 22:20.575
Who knows how much more
danger I'd be putting her in.

22:20.585 --> 22:24.705
I feel like she'd be more protected
if she didn't know the whole truth.

22:26.435 --> 22:28.655
I know the whole truth.

22:28.665 --> 22:31.755
Thankfully, you can
take care of yourself.

22:33.165 --> 22:35.425
Yeah, I guess.

22:37.455 --> 22:40.445
Oh, my god. There's something there.

22:41.265 --> 22:43.705
You were right.

22:44.285 --> 22:47.305
They put something in her brain.

22:51.865 --> 22:53.865
- What did you do to amanda?
- What?

22:53.875 --> 22:55.345
You put something in her head.

22:55.355 --> 22:56.675
Kyle, you're being really...

22:56.685 --> 22:58.475
tell me what it is.

23:00.375 --> 23:03.645
Ok. It's something new
we've developed. It's safe.

23:03.655 --> 23:06.895
Instead of typical sedative you
use an nanoscopic neuro-blocker.

23:06.925 --> 23:08.915
Attaches itself to the
receptors on the brain stem.

23:08.935 --> 23:10.215
Why would you do that?

23:10.245 --> 23:12.465
So she wouldn't remember
anything from that night.

23:12.495 --> 23:13.695
It should have dissolved.

23:13.725 --> 23:14.975
Well, it hasn'T.

23:15.005 --> 23:16.885
She's having side effects
and I need to get it out.

23:16.905 --> 23:18.335
We can't get it out.

23:18.365 --> 23:19.655
But we might be able to disintegrate it.

23:19.665 --> 23:22.605
We? You mean latnok?

23:22.945 --> 23:25.085
I'd like to help.

23:27.795 --> 23:30.825
Kyle, don't try anything on
your own. You could hurt her.

23:30.835 --> 23:32.135
Let me make a phone call.

23:32.185 --> 23:34.125
You've done enough.

23:37.765 --> 23:40.845
Hilary, where are you when I need you?

23:43.185 --> 23:45.775
Where are you off to?

23:47.005 --> 23:49.605
Amanda's concert?

23:50.415 --> 23:53.595
Oh, crap. You can totally
tell when I'm lying, huh?

23:54.465 --> 23:56.885
Just like kyle.

23:56.895 --> 23:59.315
You're going to meet mark.

23:59.325 --> 24:01.205
Listen...

24:02.475 --> 24:04.975
let me break it down for you.

24:05.655 --> 24:07.395
When it comes to living in this house,

24:07.435 --> 24:09.835
I know we all gather round the
kitchen island and yuk it up

24:09.845 --> 24:12.145
and we're all smiles and
hugs and touching moments,

24:12.175 --> 24:14.985
but underneath, it is us versus them.

24:15.015 --> 24:19.475
Everyone under legal voting age is
honor-bound to keep each other's secrets.

24:20.135 --> 24:22.105
Well, I can keep a secret.

24:22.115 --> 24:24.305
Great.

24:25.675 --> 24:26.725
That's it?

24:26.765 --> 24:28.375
As long as you don't rat me
out to mom and dad, you're in.

24:28.385 --> 24:29.955
I won'T.

24:29.985 --> 24:32.425
Fine. Good.

24:35.195 --> 24:37.945
You know, you should
wear your hair down.

24:37.955 --> 24:42.345
Long healthy hair helps signal a prospective
male to your reproductive potential.

24:43.825 --> 24:46.935
Ok, thanks. That's good to know.

24:57.735 --> 24:59.455
mark.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.405
How's it going, man?

25:01.425 --> 25:03.405
Good, man. Really good.

25:03.415 --> 25:06.815
I'm close to a breakthrough on
the three dimensional algorithm.

25:07.455 --> 25:09.945
Glad to hear it. Look.

25:12.635 --> 25:16.335
I heard through the grapevine you've
been spending time with lori trager.

25:17.855 --> 25:23.305
Uh, I guess. She's a great girl.

25:24.025 --> 25:26.005
No doubt.

25:26.015 --> 25:30.765
But, um, you know how we like
to keep things confidential.

25:32.005 --> 25:36.335
Our goal is to get our
guy back in the fold.

25:36.655 --> 25:39.205
You were never supposed to
make contact with his sister.

25:39.215 --> 25:43.155
I know. We met by
accident. It was just A...

25:43.545 --> 25:46.435
I'll keep things separate. I
mean, we're just hanging out.

25:47.435 --> 25:49.765
Not anymore.

25:53.835 --> 25:55.005
Jessi, hey!

25:55.035 --> 25:56.665
Your pants are down.

25:56.715 --> 25:58.725
Oh, look at that.

25:58.735 --> 26:00.345
What are you doing?

26:00.375 --> 26:03.045
I, uh, was just thinking of, uh...

26:03.055 --> 26:05.485
- hey, she's pretty.
- Don't look at that!

26:08.505 --> 26:10.645
Are you ok?

26:10.675 --> 26:13.265
Knee... broken.

26:14.555 --> 26:17.585
Leave. Out!

26:26.465 --> 26:28.745
Good. I need your
help figuring this out.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.155
I thought you couldn't be seen with me.

26:31.195 --> 26:33.355
I don't have time for that.

26:33.365 --> 26:36.625
What we saw is a neuro-block
which hasn't been dissolved.

26:36.655 --> 26:40.235
It's keeping amanda's memory of what
to play from getting to her fingers.

26:40.255 --> 26:43.295
But I think I can eliminate
it with an electrical charge.

26:43.305 --> 26:44.445
Ok.

26:44.475 --> 26:46.765
How do I do it without
electrocuting her?

26:46.785 --> 26:49.345
That's a risk I'd be willing to take.

26:50.685 --> 26:52.805
I know. You don't have time for this.

26:56.585 --> 26:58.105
- That's amanda's head?
- Right.

26:58.115 --> 26:59.575
It's empty.

26:59.605 --> 27:01.375
You don't have to be here.

27:01.415 --> 27:04.305
Except this is my room now.

27:05.225 --> 27:08.995
I have to regulate the voltage and apply
the right amount to disintegrate the block.

27:09.025 --> 27:11.655
But without hurting her.

27:20.175 --> 27:21.735
- That's not enough.
- I know.

27:21.745 --> 27:24.065
- You need more power if you want it to work.
- I know.

27:24.075 --> 27:26.945
Let me concentrate.

27:33.395 --> 27:36.975
That's it. You're doing it.

27:37.765 --> 27:41.385
More. More.

27:42.525 --> 27:46.515
More. More.

27:55.861 --> 27:59.711
I think I need to touch amanda to control
the electrical flow more precisely.

28:00.131 --> 28:02.051
She'll feel it and
know what you're doing.

28:02.101 --> 28:03.871
Not if I can distract her.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.731
While you're zapping her?

28:07.031 --> 28:10.571
Does someone want to explain why my
laptop just fried like my brain on drugs?

28:10.591 --> 28:12.601
I must have caused a power surge.

28:12.651 --> 28:14.121
Sorry. I'll fix it later.

28:14.131 --> 28:15.471
Later not so good for me.

28:15.491 --> 28:17.911
I was in the middle
of something important.

28:17.931 --> 28:19.941
Charlotte cam live.

28:19.951 --> 28:23.291
See, it's you. You are the problem.

28:23.301 --> 28:26.401
Eavesdropping, barging in without
knocking, blowing out electricity.

28:26.421 --> 28:29.781
- That was me.
- Fine. Then you get the assist.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.441
I can't take it anymore.
I can't get a minute alone.

28:32.451 --> 28:34.751
Why don't you go somewhere else, then?

28:34.791 --> 28:38.271
Because this is my house! Not yours!

28:42.581 --> 28:45.381
Does he think I don't know that?

28:46.231 --> 28:50.051
When I first moved in, nobody
wanted me here except for nicole.

28:50.341 --> 28:53.351
But I had nowhere else to go.

28:53.361 --> 28:56.621
They'll come around.
It'll just take time.

28:57.231 --> 29:00.201
How much time before
josh isn't mad at me?

29:00.771 --> 29:02.811
Probably until andy comes back tonight.

29:02.831 --> 29:05.311
A welcome home kiss from her,
he'll forget why he's upset.

29:05.321 --> 29:07.281
Kyle, that's it!

29:07.481 --> 29:08.241
What?

29:08.271 --> 29:11.311
How you can help amanda without
her knowing what you're doing.

29:11.381 --> 29:13.771
Pass the electricity through a kiss.

29:13.801 --> 29:17.341
I won't know how much power to give
her. If I'm wrong I'll electrocute her.

29:18.521 --> 29:20.681
Then you'll have to practice.

29:20.711 --> 29:22.561
On what?

29:22.761 --> 29:24.841
Me.

29:26.731 --> 29:29.431
Are you all charged up?

29:37.921 --> 29:41.241
- Ready?
- Ok.

29:50.231 --> 29:52.101
- Either of you seen lori?
- No.

29:52.851 --> 29:55.021
She's been out all day.

29:55.061 --> 29:56.331
Did she say anything to you?

29:56.351 --> 29:58.411
Nothing at all.

30:01.351 --> 30:03.281
What was that?

30:03.291 --> 30:04.911
What was what?

30:04.941 --> 30:06.491
You just gave her a look.

30:06.521 --> 30:08.261
That was your "I know
you're lying" look.

30:08.271 --> 30:10.981
I don't have that look.

30:10.991 --> 30:13.921
Did lori ask you to lie?

30:16.291 --> 30:19.171
I knew it. She's with mark.

30:27.371 --> 30:31.271
There you are. I thought you
ran off with a girl your own age.

30:31.811 --> 30:35.341
Yeah. Uh, I'm sorry. I got held up.

30:35.351 --> 30:37.841
Lucky for you I'm not high maintenance.

30:37.861 --> 30:40.061
Do you want me to come to you?

30:40.971 --> 30:47.361
Listen, lori, um, I don't
even know how to say this.

30:49.751 --> 30:52.961
Is this the part where
it's not easy anymore?

30:54.491 --> 30:57.871
Look, my future's really important to
me and I don't want to jeopardize it.

30:57.911 --> 30:59.421
I got it.

30:59.451 --> 31:02.041
Now, lori, come on.
This isn't about you.

31:02.051 --> 31:04.221
Mark, I said I got it.

31:04.251 --> 31:06.661
And now I'm going to hang up.

31:06.671 --> 31:09.761
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Goodbye.

31:38.521 --> 31:40.471
This is weird.

31:40.491 --> 31:41.681
It's science.

31:41.701 --> 31:44.321
I know, but I've never
kissed you before.

31:44.331 --> 31:45.421
You've seen me naked.

31:45.441 --> 31:47.211
You're not helping.

31:47.221 --> 31:49.181
Sorry.

31:52.681 --> 31:56.101
I shouldn't be kissing
anyone other than amanda.

31:57.171 --> 31:59.661
Fine. Go kiss amanda.

31:59.671 --> 32:01.961
Give her your best
guess about the voltage.

32:01.991 --> 32:05.131
Maybe you'll be right
and you won't kill her.

32:09.941 --> 32:12.311
Sorry.

32:12.591 --> 32:14.961
You need more practice.

32:19.201 --> 32:20.481
Amanda, hi.

32:20.511 --> 32:21.721
I think kyle's in his room.

32:21.751 --> 32:23.121
Actually, I wanted to see you.

32:23.141 --> 32:24.451
But if you're on your
way out the door...

32:24.461 --> 32:27.121
no, that's ok. Please.

32:30.761 --> 32:33.441
I was hoping you could teach
me some relaxation techniques.

32:33.471 --> 32:35.021
You nervous about the concert tonight?

32:35.051 --> 32:37.971
The entire scholarship committee
from u-dub is gonna be there.

32:38.021 --> 32:40.101
Watching and judging.

32:40.131 --> 32:43.221
I haven't been able to get through the
piece in weeks and my mom's all over me.

32:43.241 --> 32:47.081
Well, sometimes parents don't
realize the pressure they're adding.

32:47.391 --> 32:50.191
It's not just her. I'm off my game.

32:50.591 --> 32:54.611
It's not the easiest thing in the world to
have kyle and jessi living under the same roof.

32:54.621 --> 32:58.571
I can see how that would bother
you, but you can trust kyle.

32:58.611 --> 33:01.071
I know.

33:01.081 --> 33:03.551
I guess I don't trust her.

33:03.561 --> 33:06.311
Is that awful?

33:06.321 --> 33:10.041
Amanda, you and kyle have
a very special connection.

33:10.061 --> 33:13.921
He would never do
anything to hurt you, ok?

33:14.121 --> 33:16.731
Trust that.

33:18.051 --> 33:19.691
I don't want to hurt you again.

33:19.701 --> 33:21.711
I can take it.

33:21.721 --> 33:23.561
Maybe if I touched you.

33:23.581 --> 33:27.391
Use my hands to complete a circuit, any
extra current will flow back through me.

33:27.401 --> 33:29.411
It's worth a shot.

33:29.431 --> 33:31.681
Do you have enough
charge left to try again?

33:31.731 --> 33:34.161
I think so.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.771
How's that?

33:41.791 --> 33:44.481
That's not bad.

33:45.311 --> 33:48.361
I feel warm.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.771
It tingles a little.

33:53.011 --> 33:55.371
Are you ready?

33:55.401 --> 33:58.181
Just try to be gentle.

34:02.311 --> 34:05.031
I can hear your heart beating.

34:05.041 --> 34:07.311
Yours, too.

34:16.981 --> 34:18.871
Amanda.

34:22.960 --> 34:25.790
Amanda, wait. Let me explain.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.020
You are always trying to explain!

34:28.050 --> 34:31.880
Explaining why you keep secrets, explaining why
you didn't tell me what happened on prom night.

34:31.909 --> 34:34.469
But there is no explanation
for why you were kissing jessi!

34:34.489 --> 34:36.929
There is. I'll tell you everything.

34:37.260 --> 34:39.790
I don't even care anymore,
because none of it matters.

34:39.820 --> 34:41.590
It does matter.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.840
It'll help you understand
why all of this is happening.

34:43.860 --> 34:47.590
Kyle, the only person who doesn't
understand what is happening is you.

34:48.590 --> 34:49.870
Please.

34:49.889 --> 34:52.270
I'm late for my recital.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.550
I've ruined it.

35:03.910 --> 35:06.660
I've ruined us.

35:08.510 --> 35:11.240
I'm so sorry, kyle.

35:13.260 --> 35:16.720
She's gonna get to that section of the
music and she won't be able to play it.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.650
I can't let that happen.

35:18.690 --> 35:20.160
I have to help her.

35:20.180 --> 35:22.690
Is there any other way than kissing her?

35:23.460 --> 35:25.560
No.

35:26.930 --> 35:29.660
Then I guess you have
to go make it right.

35:33.510 --> 35:36.150
Thanks, jessi.

35:58.730 --> 36:00.750
Comfortable?

36:00.790 --> 36:02.350
I need to clear my head.

36:02.370 --> 36:04.640
The tub always works for kyle.

36:04.650 --> 36:08.090
I thought you'd be with andy.
Isn't tonight the big homecoming?

36:08.690 --> 36:11.520
Her mom's extended their vacation
rental for another three weeks.

36:11.550 --> 36:15.280
Oh, sweetie. I'm sorry.

36:18.620 --> 36:21.220
I know you're frustrated.

36:21.230 --> 36:24.240
I just want to see her.

36:24.620 --> 36:28.080
I thought it was for other reasons,

36:28.090 --> 36:33.190
but today I got all mad at kyle and jessi and
all I could think of was telling andy about it.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.390
I just really miss her.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.650
Yeah.

36:41.150 --> 36:45.260
The jessi thing, you know
it's not gonna be easy, right?

36:45.280 --> 36:48.210
I know we all got used to
kyle and that turned out great.

36:48.230 --> 36:51.270
I just hope we can get used to her.

36:51.770 --> 36:54.300
So do I.

36:54.310 --> 36:57.090
- Is everything ok?
- Fine.

37:01.170 --> 37:03.670
You've been gone a while.
Do anything exciting?

37:04.120 --> 37:05.570
Not really, no.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.500
How about I phrase it this
way: See anyone exciting?

37:08.530 --> 37:11.020
Actually, no, dad, I
didn'T. And thank you, jessi.

37:11.030 --> 37:12.730
I knew you couldn't
keep your mouth shut.

37:12.760 --> 37:14.320
Jessi didn't have to say a word.

37:14.340 --> 37:17.540
I'm sure she was a
real pillar of secrecy.

37:17.550 --> 37:19.990
I'll just go.

37:21.050 --> 37:22.810
This isn't her fault.

37:22.830 --> 37:24.200
Oh, that's good. Stick up for her.

37:24.210 --> 37:25.950
Let's see how else
you can destroy my day.

37:25.970 --> 37:27.730
I didn't destroy your day.

37:28.020 --> 37:30.000
No?Because it was going pretty well

37:30.010 --> 37:33.490
until mark told me he won't date me
because he's afraid of his future.

37:33.510 --> 37:35.410
Good. He should be.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.550
Why do you get to decide who
I can and can't go out with?

37:37.580 --> 37:40.470
Because I'm your father
and you live in my house!

37:40.780 --> 37:41.950
Real original, dad.

37:41.980 --> 37:44.560
Does it feel good to be
a walking parental clich?

37:44.580 --> 37:47.100
You want a clich? Go to your room!

37:57.290 --> 37:59.180
You are not allowed back here.

37:59.210 --> 38:01.320
- I need to see her.
- I don't know what you did to her,

38:01.330 --> 38:03.910
but my daughter is back
there crying her eyes out.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.240
I've never seen her like this.

38:05.260 --> 38:07.520
I can help her. Please.

38:07.530 --> 38:10.310
Don't you think you've done enough?

38:13.330 --> 38:15.670
Keep him out.

39:10.730 --> 39:12.780
Two minutes.

39:37.860 --> 39:39.760
What are you doing here?

39:39.780 --> 39:43.200
I couldn't let you perform without
trying to make things better.

39:43.210 --> 39:47.400
It's just... I feel so sad.

39:48.910 --> 39:51.140
I did this to you.

39:51.150 --> 39:53.680
Amanda, I'm so sorry.

39:53.710 --> 39:56.120
I trusted you.

39:56.130 --> 39:59.000
And I broke that trust.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.380
I hurt you.

40:00.410 --> 40:03.900
I never thought I'd do
anything to hurt you, but I did.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.740
I love you so much, amanda.

40:09.130 --> 40:14.850
I love you, to that's
why it hurts so badly.

40:16.570 --> 40:19.660
It's not that you kissed her.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.730
It's that I can feel what's
happening between you two.

40:22.750 --> 40:26.260
- There's nothing.
- You don't see it. But it's there.

40:30.900 --> 40:35.830
I can't be with you when I know
I'm losing you to someone else.

40:37.170 --> 40:40.090
You'll never lose me.

40:41.940 --> 40:44.800
I already have.

40:46.520 --> 40:49.940
I'm sorry. One minute.

40:52.430 --> 40:54.520
I can't do this.

40:55.160 --> 40:56.820
I can't go out and play.

40:56.830 --> 40:58.380
Let me help you.

40:58.390 --> 41:00.370
I know how to fix your problem.

41:00.660 --> 41:02.620
How?

41:03.250 --> 41:07.990
If you have any trust left
for me at all, let me show you.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.750
You're on.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.930
*******

42:27.090 --> 42:29.350
Amanda's music had brought us together.

42:29.740 --> 42:32.920
We had connected that
first time I heard her play.

42:32.940 --> 42:37.260
And now, somehow our
connection had been severed.

42:58.900 --> 43:01.150
Though she had never played better,

43:01.160 --> 43:04.570
it broke my heart to know that
because of what I had done,

43:04.590 --> 43:06.810
she would be playing on without me.
