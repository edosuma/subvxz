WEBVTT

00:33.232 --> 00:34.600
Okay ladies and gentlemen,

00:34.632 --> 00:37.135
we have arrived safe and sound.

00:37.168 --> 00:38.503
No need to thank me folks.

00:38.537 --> 00:40.039
Just remember me in your wills.

00:40.071 --> 00:43.708
Jay Butler, J as in the
bird, Butler as in Jeeves.

00:43.741 --> 00:46.544
You are such a card, Jay.

00:46.577 --> 00:50.181
Jeeves, are you familiar
with PG Wodehouse?

00:50.214 --> 00:51.717
Great writer, very funny.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.252
Well, you know me, I like funny.

00:53.284 --> 00:55.553
Watch your step.
Love that shirt!

00:55.586 --> 00:57.223
Me too.

00:57.256 --> 00:58.924
Go get an enema.

00:58.957 --> 01:02.194
Hey, hey, don't go away mad.

01:02.226 --> 01:03.562
See you tomorrow!

01:06.532 --> 01:09.601
It isn't that we don't
love your father.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.171
It's just that he's become a...

01:12.204 --> 01:13.672
Pain in the ass.

01:13.705 --> 01:14.940
Charles.

01:14.972 --> 01:17.775
Shut up, Catherine,
you know it's true.

01:17.809 --> 01:19.512
I wouldn't put it that way.

01:19.544 --> 01:22.147
You're kicking him
out, aren't you?

01:25.116 --> 01:27.520
We just feel Mr. Byrd
would be much happier

01:27.553 --> 01:29.088
in the country.

01:29.121 --> 01:32.223
Golden Oaks has an
excellent reputation.

01:32.256 --> 01:33.892
He's not going to
like it, not one bit.

01:33.925 --> 01:35.894
Well, luckily he doesn't
have a choice in the matter.

01:35.928 --> 01:37.230
So where do we sign?

01:39.297 --> 01:40.865
Jay-B.

01:44.268 --> 01:46.705
Hey man, do you even
know what you're saying?

01:48.707 --> 01:50.276
I don't know!

01:50.309 --> 01:51.711
Ooh, hang on, hang on.

01:53.312 --> 01:55.981
Ah it's the ex, I've
got to take this.

01:59.684 --> 02:01.921
Hey Susan, what's up?

02:01.954 --> 02:03.656
Did you forget something?

02:05.690 --> 02:06.625
It's my birthday?

02:07.925 --> 02:09.093
It's your birthday?

02:09.127 --> 02:11.764
No, wait, wait, it's
our anniversary.

02:11.796 --> 02:14.165
Ah, we don't do
that anymore, do we?

02:15.232 --> 02:18.103
Chloe had her
recital this morning.

02:18.135 --> 02:19.805
She was disappointed
you weren't there.

02:19.837 --> 02:21.272
This morning?

02:21.306 --> 02:23.943
No, no, no, no, no, hang
on, hang on, no, no, no no.

02:23.975 --> 02:25.176
I have it down as...

02:26.944 --> 02:28.180
...this morning.

02:28.212 --> 02:29.247
So typical, Jay.

02:31.016 --> 02:32.585
Look, I'll give her a call,
all right, I'll give...

02:32.617 --> 02:34.619
Hang on, hang on, I got
another call coming in.

02:34.652 --> 02:36.120
Okay, it's probably her.

02:36.153 --> 02:37.689
Hang on, I'll be right back.

02:37.723 --> 02:38.558
Hey!

02:39.690 --> 02:40.325
Yes.

02:42.326 --> 02:44.796
No, say that again?

02:47.699 --> 02:49.335
No, no, okay.

02:51.169 --> 02:53.305
Yeah I understand.

02:53.337 --> 02:54.339
Thank you.

03:00.678 --> 03:01.247
Susan.

03:02.347 --> 03:04.082
My father just died.

03:13.025 --> 03:14.193
I'm so sorry, Jay.

03:14.225 --> 03:15.827
Thanks, that's okay.

03:15.861 --> 03:17.296
We weren't that close.

03:17.329 --> 03:18.630
Yeah that's an understatement.

03:18.664 --> 03:21.200
Manny, show some respect.

03:21.232 --> 03:23.701
Excuse me, Jay if
you have a moment,

03:23.735 --> 03:25.071
can I have a word with you?

03:28.339 --> 03:30.075
Excuse me.

03:31.843 --> 03:32.711
Who's that?

03:32.743 --> 03:35.146
The old man's attorney.

03:35.180 --> 03:36.314
This should be interesting.

03:38.315 --> 03:41.653
So, Jay, how are you
doing with all this?

03:41.687 --> 03:42.988
Not so bad I guess.

03:44.422 --> 03:46.290
You do know your father
had a considerable estate.

03:46.324 --> 03:48.861
Oh yeah, he made
that very well known.

03:48.893 --> 03:50.261
Indeed he did.

03:51.862 --> 03:54.299
Look, I don't want you to
be blindsided by this later,

03:54.331 --> 03:55.133
but...

03:56.333 --> 03:57.670
...he left everything
to charity.

04:00.404 --> 04:04.175
No, no, no, no, there was
something there for my kids.

04:04.208 --> 04:07.278
He changed his mind
and at the last minute.

04:08.313 --> 04:10.982
Charity, which one?

04:11.016 --> 04:15.021
Various ones, the church,
the Cancer Society,

04:15.954 --> 04:16.755
the Elks Club.

04:17.888 --> 04:19.391
The Elks Club?

04:21.892 --> 04:24.363
He left money to the
frickin' Elks Club

04:24.395 --> 04:27.331
and nothing for me,
nothing for my family?

04:27.364 --> 04:28.232
I'm afraid not.

04:28.265 --> 04:29.367
Not one red cent?

04:31.303 --> 04:35.274
I tried to dissuade him,
Jay, but you know how he was.

04:35.306 --> 04:36.474
Oh yeah yeah, I
wanted to be an actor

04:36.508 --> 04:40.311
instead of work for him so
he had nothing to do with me.

04:40.344 --> 04:42.414
Jay, there were other reasons.

04:42.447 --> 04:44.183
Like what?

04:44.215 --> 04:46.951
I don't think we should
get into that now.

04:46.984 --> 04:48.287
I just wanted you to know.

04:50.255 --> 04:51.257
Thanks.

04:59.397 --> 05:01.332
You've gotta be kidding me.

05:02.868 --> 05:04.236
You're always kidding.

05:04.269 --> 05:06.138
You're kidding me right now.

05:06.171 --> 05:07.238
I wish I was.

05:08.339 --> 05:10.075
Jesus, he never told you?

05:10.108 --> 05:11.744
Susan, we didn't talk.

05:11.777 --> 05:13.378
Well, can't you fight it?

05:15.813 --> 05:17.315
I don't think I'm up for that.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.950
His people are all sharks.

05:18.984 --> 05:21.986
Oh, well that's just wonderful.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.322
We were counting on something.

05:24.488 --> 05:26.224
You know, Danny
got into Stanford.

05:26.258 --> 05:27.125
He did?

05:27.159 --> 05:28.194
Well that's great.

05:28.226 --> 05:31.996
No it isn't, we don't
have a dime to pay for it.

05:32.029 --> 05:34.166
You said your father
was setting up a trust,

05:34.198 --> 05:35.299
now what are you going to do?

05:35.332 --> 05:36.501
I'll figure something out.

05:36.534 --> 05:39.237
Oh, like what, being an actor,

05:39.270 --> 05:41.839
or running a failed restaurant,

05:41.873 --> 05:46.378
or what about your memorable
stint as a life coach?

05:46.411 --> 05:48.280
What a joke.

05:50.347 --> 05:52.350
We are so sorry.

05:52.383 --> 05:54.485
Anything we can do to
help, please let us know.

05:54.519 --> 05:56.222
Thank you very much.

06:00.892 --> 06:04.029
Tonight you're
what, a van driver?

06:04.061 --> 06:05.931
I told you that's just temporary

06:05.964 --> 06:08.534
until I get my
feet on the ground.

06:08.566 --> 06:12.303
Oh, your feet on the
ground, that'll be a first.

06:13.371 --> 06:14.774
You've had enough.

06:16.373 --> 06:18.476
I'm just getting started.

06:18.510 --> 06:20.178
Oh God.

06:20.212 --> 06:23.282
You know dad, I really think
you're gonna love this place.

06:23.315 --> 06:25.317
They got everything you want.

06:25.349 --> 06:30.356
They got a pool, golf course,
entertainment, classes.

06:31.989 --> 06:35.393
If it's so great, you go there.

06:35.426 --> 06:37.361
You know I just might,

06:37.395 --> 06:39.998
but the old lady might
get a little jealous.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.266
Apparently there's a lot
of single women up there

06:42.299 --> 06:43.501
and I hear they get pretty wild.

06:46.270 --> 06:49.874
Come on Dad, don't make this
any harder than it needs to be.

06:49.907 --> 06:51.976
Look, I arranged for a
driver to take you up there

06:52.010 --> 06:54.079
tomorrow after breakfast, okay?

06:57.082 --> 06:59.051
Fine, be that way.

06:59.084 --> 07:00.052
Chucky.

07:00.085 --> 07:01.253
That's Charles, Dad.

07:01.286 --> 07:04.356
Chucky, I put you and the
girls in charge of my affairs

07:04.388 --> 07:07.225
because I didn't want
you to be waiting around

07:07.258 --> 07:08.393
for me to die.

07:08.426 --> 07:10.061
I want you to know that we
really appreciate that, Dad.

07:10.094 --> 07:12.196
But this conservatorship thing,

07:12.229 --> 07:14.498
I don't like it, not one bit.

07:14.532 --> 07:17.335
You've taken off
my balls, Chucky.

07:17.368 --> 07:19.337
I understand how you must
feel, but at your age...

07:19.371 --> 07:21.073
Bullshit, my age.

07:21.106 --> 07:23.342
I remember when I was
changing your diapers.

07:23.375 --> 07:24.343
Well soon you
might need somebody

07:24.375 --> 07:25.376
to help you change yours.

07:25.409 --> 07:27.279
I don't wear diapers, Chucky,

07:27.311 --> 07:29.146
and I'll be damned
if I ever will.

07:29.179 --> 07:30.014
All right.

07:31.549 --> 07:34.318
Okay look, calm down.

07:34.351 --> 07:37.388
I just, I got to go, okay.

07:37.421 --> 07:41.193
But you are going to thank
me for this, I guarantee it.

08:06.417 --> 08:08.019
Geez, Pop.

08:09.087 --> 08:10.890
We never got to say goodbye.

08:12.222 --> 08:14.359
Hell, we never even
got to know each other.

08:15.726 --> 08:17.328
We thought that there'd
be plenty of time,

08:17.361 --> 08:19.263
that we'd...

08:19.296 --> 08:21.499
...we'd work things
out, someday.

08:23.301 --> 08:24.135
Someday.

08:27.005 --> 08:29.408
Someday will never come.

08:34.545 --> 08:37.481
So all Mr Byrd's personals
have been loaded in the van.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.284
Great, how far is this place?

08:39.317 --> 08:40.952
Just a two day drive.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.322
Mr. Byrd won't fly, this
seemed the best alternative.

08:43.355 --> 08:45.691
So here's your per diem
and the contact list

08:45.723 --> 08:47.659
in case of emergency.

08:49.294 --> 08:50.295
You okay?

08:51.462 --> 08:54.366
Yeah yeah, actually I could
use a couple of days away.

08:54.399 --> 08:56.301
Right right, I'm sorry
about your father, Jay.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.501
Thank you.

08:57.534 --> 08:59.236
You sure you're up for this?

08:59.270 --> 09:00.472
Mr. Byrd's an important patient,

09:00.505 --> 09:01.505
we can't afford any mishaps.

09:01.539 --> 09:04.009
You can count on me, sir.

09:04.042 --> 09:06.278
All right, shall
we get Mr. Byrd?

09:06.310 --> 09:07.111
Lead the way.

09:07.145 --> 09:08.413
All right.

09:08.446 --> 09:10.048
Hey, how you doing this morning?

09:10.081 --> 09:11.015
Good to see you Nicola, yeah.

09:12.616 --> 09:16.020
Alright, so Mr. Byrd's
room is right over here.

09:17.121 --> 09:19.390
Let's get him out of there.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.196
Oh oh, where is he?

09:25.730 --> 09:27.332
Does he do this often?

09:27.365 --> 09:29.634
No, he never wanders off.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.301
Sir, this way.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.072
Francois, have you seen Harry?

09:34.105 --> 09:35.273
No.

09:35.305 --> 09:37.275
Let's go this way, come
on, excuse me ma'am.

09:37.308 --> 09:39.044
Hurry up!

09:46.550 --> 09:49.420
Where is that pain in the ass?

09:51.688 --> 09:53.391
Looking for someone?

09:55.326 --> 09:59.431
Well, come on, let's get
this show on the road.

09:59.463 --> 10:00.732
I don't have all day.

10:04.669 --> 10:06.071
Have fun.

10:18.582 --> 10:19.818
Wow.

10:19.851 --> 10:21.620
Beautiful day for a
drive, eh, Mr. Byrd?

10:22.620 --> 10:25.323
You, uh, you
comfortable back there?

10:27.458 --> 10:28.327
Good, good.

10:30.260 --> 10:32.530
Ah, nothing like the open road.

10:32.563 --> 10:34.198
Just look at it.

10:34.231 --> 10:37.068
You know, I just
love road trips.

10:37.101 --> 10:38.470
We went everywhere.

10:38.502 --> 10:40.538
Cross country, Canada, Mexico.

10:40.572 --> 10:44.576
I remember one year we went
to Florida, there and back.

10:44.608 --> 10:47.211
Oh my God, what a trip that was.

10:47.245 --> 10:49.147
It's a great big
world out there.

10:49.179 --> 10:50.114
You don't say.

10:50.148 --> 10:51.750
I do!

10:51.783 --> 10:54.053
Hey Harry, can I call you Harry?

10:55.220 --> 10:57.689
You can call me
mud for all I care.

10:57.722 --> 10:59.191
That's a good one.

10:59.223 --> 11:01.125
Harry look, now we're
going to be cooped up

11:01.159 --> 11:02.294
in this van for
a couple of days.

11:02.327 --> 11:04.729
Now it can be boring
or it can be fun.

11:04.761 --> 11:07.465
I personally choose
fun, what do you say?

11:13.438 --> 11:14.472
Okay.

11:20.845 --> 11:24.416
I may not look it, but
I can remember a time

11:24.448 --> 11:27.486
before everything was
shopping malls and franchises

11:27.519 --> 11:30.755
and that the world had
character, personality back then.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.691
You always talk this much?

11:33.725 --> 11:36.394
Only when there's no
one else to talk to.

11:36.427 --> 11:39.231
You can always count
on yourself, right?

11:39.264 --> 11:40.698
Yeah, you sure can.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.433
Hey, how about some music?

11:42.467 --> 11:44.269
We got satellite radio,
what do you like?

11:44.302 --> 11:46.705
Heavy metal, rap, punk rock.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.205
Oldies.

11:48.239 --> 11:50.375
Oldies, of course,
I should've known

11:50.408 --> 11:52.244
you're an oldies kind of guy.

11:52.276 --> 11:53.544
No problem, hold on.

11:54.779 --> 11:57.649
It's just Casey Kasem
with America's Top 40.

11:57.682 --> 12:01.553
This is a one hit wonder,
but became more after that.

12:04.188 --> 12:05.557
It's not that we
don't trust our dad,

12:05.590 --> 12:06.758
right, it's just that lately

12:06.790 --> 12:09.294
he's been a little
unpredictable, even...

12:09.327 --> 12:11.496
Crazy is more like it.

12:16.634 --> 12:18.436
I completely understand.

12:18.468 --> 12:19.737
That's why it's a good
thing you've got him

12:19.770 --> 12:22.339
to sign the voluntary
conservatorship.

12:22.372 --> 12:23.741
You have the papers?

12:23.775 --> 12:24.876
Catherine, do you...

12:29.847 --> 12:31.250
There were so many.

12:32.951 --> 12:34.952
Do you mean this?

12:34.986 --> 12:36.420
Ah, that's it.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.760
It's not signed.

12:42.794 --> 12:43.629
What?

12:45.630 --> 12:47.432
Dad told me he
signed everything.

12:47.465 --> 12:49.301
You might've checked them...

12:52.470 --> 12:54.573
Okay, it's fine.

12:54.606 --> 12:56.640
I'll tell you what, we'll
just get him to sign it.

12:56.674 --> 12:58.309
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

12:59.910 --> 13:01.412
Unless these particular
documents are signed

13:01.446 --> 13:04.349
within the next three
days, they're invalid.

13:05.582 --> 13:08.419
We'd have to start over and
the court would frown on that.

13:08.452 --> 13:12.223
If there's any indication of
resistance in the process...

13:12.256 --> 13:17.261
Good Christ, Charles, I thought
you said this would work!

13:18.395 --> 13:19.830
Would you calm down,
just stop it, calm down!

13:19.864 --> 13:21.733
It's gonna be fine, all right?

13:21.765 --> 13:23.431
We'll just FedEx the
papers up to Golden Oaks.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.937
Or better yet, I will
fly myself up there.

13:25.970 --> 13:28.373
Right, and I'll be there when
he arrives tomorrow evening.

13:28.405 --> 13:31.375
Is that good, we're
all okay with this?

13:31.409 --> 13:32.376
Yes.

13:32.409 --> 13:33.245
Good, thank you.

13:40.717 --> 13:41.885
Filet of sole and
a side of slaw.

13:41.919 --> 13:43.020
That's me.

13:43.053 --> 13:46.558
Alrighty and here's your
bacon cheeseburger with fries.

13:46.591 --> 13:48.426
Wow, that is big.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.395
Thanks, what's your name?

13:50.428 --> 13:51.029
Lisa.

13:51.062 --> 13:53.465
Lisa, Harry, Jay.

13:53.497 --> 13:55.332
Nice to meet you,
enjoy your meal.

13:55.366 --> 13:55.967
Thank you.

13:57.501 --> 13:58.902
You want a bite?

13:58.935 --> 13:59.870
No thanks.

13:59.904 --> 14:01.405
I don't usually eat like this.

14:01.438 --> 14:02.940
Uh-huh.

14:02.973 --> 14:05.276
With my metabolism, all I
have to do is skip a meal,

14:05.309 --> 14:06.444
I slim right down.

14:06.477 --> 14:09.880
I guess it's been a while
since you've missed a meal.

14:11.683 --> 14:13.585
You're a card, Harry.

14:13.617 --> 14:14.752
Ace of spades.

14:14.785 --> 14:16.621
Guess that makes you the joker.

14:16.654 --> 14:18.456
The joker, very good.

14:18.489 --> 14:19.858
You're killing me here, pal.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.525
You don't have to kiss my ass.

14:21.558 --> 14:24.462
Everyone else does because
they want something

14:24.495 --> 14:26.498
and think maybe I
can give it to them.

14:28.933 --> 14:30.601
I know what you mean.

14:30.635 --> 14:31.636
Do you now?

14:37.342 --> 14:38.443
Train Town.

14:41.411 --> 14:44.481
Oh yeah, you know I used
to take my kids there

14:44.515 --> 14:45.350
all the time.

14:45.382 --> 14:46.617
So did I.

14:46.650 --> 14:48.385
Really, it's been
around that long?

14:48.419 --> 14:52.090
Yeah, since before the
wheel was invented.

14:52.122 --> 14:53.424
Hey hey, no offense.

14:53.457 --> 14:54.458
None taken.

14:55.393 --> 14:58.930
I'm as old as the
hills and glad of it.

14:58.962 --> 15:01.900
I wouldn't want to be 20
again if you'd paid me.

15:04.635 --> 15:06.771
Hey, we got time to take a ride?

15:07.871 --> 15:09.940
On the train for
old time's sake?

15:11.775 --> 15:12.678
Sure, why not.

15:23.987 --> 15:26.891
Whoa, this is exciting.

15:28.159 --> 15:29.394
How are you doing there, Harry?

15:30.595 --> 15:34.499
I think my pacemaker
short-circuited.

15:34.531 --> 15:38.602
What, Harry, Harry
you all right, Harry!

15:40.404 --> 15:42.140
Just kidding, kid.

15:43.573 --> 15:45.943
You really got me
that time you rascal.

15:48.513 --> 15:51.149
We sure had some
good times here.

15:51.182 --> 15:53.717
You know, this place
hasn't changed a bit.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.120
How many kids you got?

15:55.153 --> 15:58.456
Two, a boy and a girl,
the loves of my life.

15:58.489 --> 16:01.559
Danny, he's 17, about
ready to start college.

16:01.592 --> 16:04.462
Chloe, 15, my princess.

16:04.495 --> 16:06.498
She's an equestrian.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.465
She likes girls?

16:08.499 --> 16:09.933
What, no!

16:09.967 --> 16:13.605
An equestrian, she
likes to ride horses.

16:13.638 --> 16:15.106
I know, I know.

16:15.139 --> 16:17.142
Can't you tell when a guy is
kidding for Christ's sake?

16:19.577 --> 16:21.078
How about you, you got kids?

16:22.179 --> 16:25.183
I got three.

16:25.216 --> 16:27.152
I tried my best to
bring them up right.

16:28.452 --> 16:29.754
I'm sure you did.

16:29.786 --> 16:30.954
I don't know.

16:30.987 --> 16:31.890
What do you mean?

16:31.923 --> 16:34.426
My father was a son of a bitch.

16:34.458 --> 16:37.494
I swore when I had kids I was
going to be just the opposite,

16:37.528 --> 16:39.798
but my kids, they
don't seem to like me.

16:39.831 --> 16:41.032
I think they're afraid of me.

16:42.699 --> 16:44.902
It's not easy being a parent.

16:44.935 --> 16:46.670
It's not easy
being a kid either.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.157
Okay well, it's not the Ritz,

17:06.189 --> 17:09.760
but a great location.

17:09.794 --> 17:11.161
The river is right
outside our door.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.664
We can fall asleep
listening to it.

17:16.033 --> 17:17.235
How romantic.

17:17.267 --> 17:21.139
Okay Harry, that's your
bed, this is mine, okay?

17:21.171 --> 17:22.039
Aces.

17:28.278 --> 17:29.513
Oolampala.

17:29.546 --> 17:31.149
What's that?

17:31.181 --> 17:32.784
Ever been to Olompali?

17:32.816 --> 17:34.785
Olompali, can't say that I have.

17:34.819 --> 17:37.556
It's on the coast, not far
from where we're going.

17:38.855 --> 17:41.859
Harriet and I used to
go there before kids.

17:41.892 --> 17:44.194
Harriet, that was
your wife, right?

17:44.227 --> 17:45.663
Right again, Sherlock.

17:47.031 --> 17:49.167
Saw some of the best
sunsets of my life there.

17:50.101 --> 17:51.736
Sounds great.

17:51.768 --> 17:53.170
I'll have to check
it out some time.

17:54.839 --> 17:55.674
Jay.

17:58.309 --> 18:01.212
I'd really like to go
there just one more time.

18:01.245 --> 18:02.647
I'm sure you will.

18:02.679 --> 18:05.484
No, I mean you and
me on this trip.

18:06.551 --> 18:10.188
Harry, look, I've got to
get you to Golden Oaks

18:10.220 --> 18:11.688
by end of day tomorrow.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.156
I'm sure you'll have
a chance to go there

18:13.189 --> 18:14.525
sometime down the road.

18:14.559 --> 18:15.994
Don't think so.

18:16.026 --> 18:17.194
Why not, what do you mean?

18:17.227 --> 18:18.962
Got a bad ticker,
just a matter of time,

18:18.996 --> 18:20.598
can't go there myself.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.266
Nobody else is going to take me.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.201
What about your kids?

18:23.234 --> 18:24.235
I've asked, they're too busy.

18:24.267 --> 18:25.903
Always some excuse.

18:28.805 --> 18:29.640
Never mind.

18:34.911 --> 18:37.247
Harry listen, how about
we get you to Golden Oaks

18:37.281 --> 18:39.984
and I personally insist that
someone take you to this

18:40.016 --> 18:41.652
Olompali place, okay?

18:44.788 --> 18:45.623
Sure, kid.

19:04.809 --> 19:07.779
Harry, come on Harry, get up.

19:07.812 --> 19:09.680
Gotta make tracks, let's go.

19:14.718 --> 19:19.724
Harry, Harry, Harry?

19:21.225 --> 19:22.294
Harry?

19:26.630 --> 19:27.265
Harry!

19:33.670 --> 19:36.240
Excuse me, folks. Sorry! Sorry!

19:37.374 --> 19:39.843
Harry! Harry! Harry!

19:43.014 --> 19:47.585
Harry! Harry! Harry!

19:52.723 --> 19:55.893
Harry, Harry, there you are!

19:55.926 --> 19:57.695
What are you doing?

19:57.727 --> 19:58.962
Washing my shorts.

19:58.996 --> 19:59.897
Your shorts?

19:59.929 --> 20:01.198
Yeah, you know what they say.

20:01.232 --> 20:02.900
No, what do they say?

20:02.932 --> 20:05.236
Cleanliness is
next to Godliness.

20:05.268 --> 20:08.171
Okay come on, you can be
holy back at the room.

20:08.205 --> 20:10.375
We gotta make tracks.

20:14.178 --> 20:16.313
You had to do that, huh?

20:16.346 --> 20:18.348
You gave me a
scare there, Harry.

20:18.381 --> 20:20.851
I thought for a moment
you tried to ditch me.

20:20.884 --> 20:23.887
You gotta stop walking
off like that, okay?

20:25.355 --> 20:27.824
Everything okay in there, Harry?

20:27.858 --> 20:29.092
Never better.

20:29.126 --> 20:31.696
Oh that Metamucil is
really working, huh?

20:31.728 --> 20:34.365
Okay, wallet and
phone and away we go.

20:37.034 --> 20:40.705
Hey Harry, you've
seen my wallet?

20:40.737 --> 20:42.806
Hang on, I'm almost done.

20:42.840 --> 20:45.342
It stinks like hell
in here though.

20:45.376 --> 20:46.344
Oh, no sharing please.

20:46.377 --> 20:48.346
No, no, my wallet and
phone, they're missing.

20:48.379 --> 20:50.848
They were right here when
I went looking for you,

20:50.880 --> 20:51.948
right there!

20:51.982 --> 20:53.718
You left the door open.

20:53.751 --> 20:55.387
Maybe someone lifted them.

20:56.887 --> 20:58.223
Oh, crap!

21:12.303 --> 21:14.104
That's just great.

21:14.138 --> 21:15.773
Not in the van either.

21:15.805 --> 21:18.775
Manager says they've had a
problem with thefts lately.

21:18.809 --> 21:20.278
Called the police?

21:20.311 --> 21:23.281
Yeah yeah, manager's giving
them the report right now.

21:23.313 --> 21:26.016
Well, I guess we're stuck, huh?

21:32.188 --> 21:33.323
What?

21:33.357 --> 21:34.325
Nothing.

21:34.358 --> 21:37.294
Listen, I'm getting you
to Golden Oaks today.

21:37.328 --> 21:39.497
Come hell or high water,
shorts or no shorts,

21:39.530 --> 21:42.033
but I need money
for gas and food.

21:42.065 --> 21:43.200
So do you have any?

21:43.234 --> 21:44.269
I'm afraid not.

21:51.108 --> 21:53.044
Since they'd already
swiped my card,

21:53.076 --> 21:55.145
they just charged it
and gave me cash back.

21:55.178 --> 21:56.880
Pretty good thinking, huh Har?

21:56.913 --> 21:58.482
Genius.

21:58.515 --> 22:00.383
Hey look, this
place we're going,

22:00.417 --> 22:01.953
I checked out the brochure.

22:01.986 --> 22:03.053
It looks pretty nice to me.

22:03.086 --> 22:04.287
Nah.

22:04.321 --> 22:05.957
What, what do you
got against it?

22:05.989 --> 22:08.125
Nothing, it wasn't my
choice, that's all.

22:08.159 --> 22:10.794
Would you like people
making decisions for you?

22:10.828 --> 22:11.963
Ever been married?

22:11.996 --> 22:13.930
I'm just kidding.

22:13.964 --> 22:15.166
I understand.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.334
It's ironic.

22:17.368 --> 22:18.203
What?

22:19.402 --> 22:21.005
The older you get,
the more you know,

22:21.037 --> 22:22.372
the less people think of you.

22:23.407 --> 22:25.176
Well Harry, then I must
know a hell of a lot

22:25.208 --> 22:26.110
and be pretty old.

22:26.142 --> 22:27.377
What do you mean?

22:29.079 --> 22:30.380
It's a long story.

22:30.413 --> 22:32.315
We've got time.

22:32.349 --> 22:34.152
I don't know, Harry.

22:34.185 --> 22:39.157
It just seems my whole life
I've been swimming upstream,

22:39.189 --> 22:41.926
people always telling me I
don't know what I'm doing.

22:41.958 --> 22:43.326
I live in a fantasy world.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.462
I'm not being sensible.

22:46.362 --> 22:48.332
If I'd listened
to crap like that,

22:48.364 --> 22:50.967
I'd never been more
than a shoe clerk.

22:51.001 --> 22:52.303
What'd you do?

22:52.335 --> 22:54.371
A lot of things,
mostly real estate.

22:55.305 --> 22:56.540
How'd you get into that?

22:56.573 --> 22:57.941
Back in the old days

22:57.975 --> 23:00.077
I saw a lot of people
coming out here.

23:00.110 --> 23:02.380
I knew they'd need
a place to live.

23:02.412 --> 23:03.280
That simple?

23:03.313 --> 23:04.481
Yes and no.

23:04.515 --> 23:06.016
I had to borrow the down payment

23:06.050 --> 23:08.452
for my first duplex
from my mother.

23:08.485 --> 23:10.487
I thought it was all
the money in the world

23:10.521 --> 23:13.357
and didn't know how
I'd ever pay it back.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.825
You stuck your neck out.

23:14.859 --> 23:16.159
Damn right, many times.

23:16.192 --> 23:18.328
Eventually I got used to it.

23:18.361 --> 23:20.497
Can't make a gain
unless you take a risk.

23:20.531 --> 23:21.933
That's what they say.

23:21.966 --> 23:23.935
Didn't always end
up on top, mind you,

23:23.967 --> 23:25.836
but won more than I lost.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.271
Good for you, Harry.

23:27.303 --> 23:32.008
Yeah well, you start with
nothing and end up with nothing.

23:32.042 --> 23:34.212
Might as well enjoy the ride.

23:34.245 --> 23:35.380
Have you?

23:35.412 --> 23:38.348
Sure, I like taking care of
property and the tenants.

23:38.381 --> 23:40.250
Most of them are okay.

23:40.284 --> 23:42.253
How about you, what's your line?

23:42.285 --> 23:43.353
My line?

23:43.387 --> 23:45.523
Always been a van driver?

23:45.555 --> 23:46.990
Oh God no.

23:47.024 --> 23:49.560
I used to be an actor,
believe it or not.

23:49.592 --> 23:51.228
Bet you're a good one.

23:51.262 --> 23:54.298
Well, you know Harry,
that's not for me to say.

23:54.331 --> 23:55.399
Still do it?

23:55.431 --> 23:56.633
No, no.

23:56.667 --> 23:58.002
Why not?

23:58.034 --> 23:59.269
You can't make money acting.

23:59.303 --> 24:01.037
Some people do.

24:01.071 --> 24:02.040
I wasn't one of them.

24:04.275 --> 24:06.177
Maybe you should
give it another shot.

24:06.209 --> 24:07.044
What?

24:07.076 --> 24:08.478
Acting.

24:09.345 --> 24:10.547
I'm not laughing at you,

24:10.581 --> 24:12.350
but that's maybe in
another lifetime.

24:31.567 --> 24:33.970
Harry, I have got to
go to the restroom.

24:34.004 --> 24:35.406
How about you, you got to go?

24:35.438 --> 24:36.640
No, I'm fine.

24:36.673 --> 24:37.540
You sure?

24:37.573 --> 24:39.310
Yeah, I'm like a camel.

24:39.342 --> 24:42.246
Don't drink much,
don't piss much either.

24:42.278 --> 24:44.047
Okay, all right.

24:44.081 --> 24:45.350
I'll be right back.

24:50.688 --> 24:52.055
Hey sugar, you wouldn't happen

24:52.089 --> 24:53.256
to have a cigarette, would you?

24:53.290 --> 24:54.992
I'm afraid not, I don't smoke.

24:55.025 --> 24:56.995
Well, good for you,
I wish I could stop.

25:05.201 --> 25:06.970
He's kind of cute.

25:07.004 --> 25:08.371
You think?

25:08.405 --> 25:09.073
I think.

25:09.105 --> 25:10.273
I like the hair on his chest.

25:10.306 --> 25:11.409
Thank you.

25:12.275 --> 25:13.544
You're so naughty.

25:13.576 --> 25:14.411
That I am.

25:32.095 --> 25:34.364
No, no, no, no, no!

25:36.332 --> 25:39.036
Harry, no, no, no, Harry stop!

25:48.312 --> 25:50.715
Somebody help, I
need help please!

25:50.747 --> 25:51.949
What's the matter sugar?

25:53.283 --> 25:55.386
Harry, this older gentlemen
I'm driving took off

25:55.419 --> 25:57.487
in the van and I've
got to get to him.

25:57.521 --> 26:00.558
He could hurt himself and
if he does, my ass is grass.

26:00.591 --> 26:03.327
Okay well calm
down, just breathe.

26:03.360 --> 26:07.398
Right over here,
focus, okay listen.

26:07.430 --> 26:09.033
We'll help you out.
Thank you.

26:09.065 --> 26:10.233
Come on girls,
let's help this guy.

26:10.266 --> 26:11.501
Thank you, thank
you all, thank you.

26:11.534 --> 26:13.403
All of you, thank you so much.

26:13.437 --> 26:15.372
Thank you all so much.

26:21.245 --> 26:22.080
Come on inside.

26:25.748 --> 26:26.583
Come on!

26:30.687 --> 26:33.524
Okay, all right, all right.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.492
Oh crap, he's getting away!

26:35.525 --> 26:36.693
Don't worry, honey.

26:36.726 --> 26:38.362
Don't worry, we got you.

26:41.064 --> 26:43.366
Don't you worry Honey,
now Betsy might be noisy,

26:43.400 --> 26:45.369
but she always gets us there.

26:45.401 --> 26:47.404
Betsy. Whatever you say.

26:47.438 --> 26:48.739
All right, here we go.

26:56.612 --> 26:59.417
Your mother wears zombie boots!

27:01.351 --> 27:05.356
So what do you girls do?

27:06.756 --> 27:09.360
You ever hear of Pussy
Gato and the Kittenettes?

27:09.392 --> 27:11.327
No I can't
say that I have.

27:11.361 --> 27:13.398
Feast your eyes on that.

27:15.865 --> 27:17.100
You're strippers?

27:18.168 --> 27:21.272
Not strippers,
burlesque artists, baby.

27:21.304 --> 27:22.105
Burlesque?

27:22.139 --> 27:22.706
Yeah.

27:22.738 --> 27:24.408
Oh, oh oh, burlesque.

27:24.440 --> 27:26.276
Oh that's great, that's great.

27:32.282 --> 27:34.385
What's your damn hurry?

27:36.887 --> 27:38.422
Well, which way did he go?

27:38.455 --> 27:40.124
He got on the on
ramp going North.

27:40.157 --> 27:41.592
Okay, right.

27:43.192 --> 27:46.529
Listen don't worry Doll
Face, he won't get too far.

27:46.563 --> 27:48.364
We got this.

27:48.398 --> 27:50.434
I'm Red by the way.

27:50.467 --> 27:51.435
Nice to meet you, Red.

27:51.467 --> 27:53.303
Nice to meet you too.

27:53.336 --> 27:55.439
How did you get
a name like that?

27:56.340 --> 27:58.275
You know I don't know.

28:00.476 --> 28:03.313
And this here is Iris
and this is Blossom.

28:03.346 --> 28:04.781
Nice to meet you.

28:04.814 --> 28:06.382
And there's Gemini.

28:06.416 --> 28:07.318
Nice to meet all of you.

28:07.351 --> 28:08.820
Nice to meet you too, babe.

28:10.419 --> 28:11.554
Is he your father?

28:11.588 --> 28:12.723
Who?

28:12.755 --> 28:13.890
The old man.

28:13.923 --> 28:16.192
Oh no, no no, just
someone I'm transporting

28:16.226 --> 28:17.395
to another home.

28:18.594 --> 28:21.297
It seems like he's not
too wild about going.

28:21.331 --> 28:23.134
Well I think you might be
onto something there, dear.

28:23.167 --> 28:25.503
Okay, ladies, we've got
to keep our eyes peeled

28:25.535 --> 28:26.836
for a gray minivan.

28:26.870 --> 28:27.670
All right.

28:27.704 --> 28:29.273
So you are a van driver?

28:29.305 --> 28:32.142
Yeah, I am, and I'm
proud of it too.

28:55.232 --> 28:56.601
Ah, I'm in trouble.

29:12.416 --> 29:13.251
Oh, man...

29:15.619 --> 29:16.754
What if we don't find him?

29:16.786 --> 29:19.456
We'll find him, we've
got to find him.

29:19.488 --> 29:21.357
Look, over there.

29:21.390 --> 29:22.426
That's it, thank God.

29:22.458 --> 29:23.693
Pull over, pull over.

29:23.726 --> 29:25.696
Okay, got it, hold
on, hold on sugar,

29:25.728 --> 29:27.430
it's gonna be all right.

29:27.464 --> 29:28.365
Thank God, thank God!

29:28.399 --> 29:31.702
Hold on, here we go,
hold on, all right.

29:31.735 --> 29:33.437
Thank you, thank you, excuse me.

29:36.239 --> 29:38.342
Harry, Harry, are you okay?

29:40.409 --> 29:42.513
Harry, what are you doing?

29:42.545 --> 29:44.280
I'm trying to find
that oldies station,

29:44.313 --> 29:46.316
no damn reception out here.

29:46.350 --> 29:48.552
No, no, I mean driving
off in the van like that.

29:48.584 --> 29:50.621
You scared the living
daylights out of me!

29:50.653 --> 29:52.355
Sorry, kid.

29:52.389 --> 29:55.292
Thought maybe I could make
it to Olampali by myself.

29:55.324 --> 29:57.961
I was wrong, I'm not
the driver I used to be.

29:57.995 --> 29:58.928
Okay.

29:58.961 --> 30:00.230
Is everything okay?

30:00.264 --> 30:01.198
Yeah, yeah I think so, yeah.

30:02.365 --> 30:03.600
Harry, you gotta pop
on the other side.

30:06.803 --> 30:08.005
Who's this?

30:08.037 --> 30:10.506
Oh, Harry, meet
my friends Red...

30:10.540 --> 30:12.576
Hi baby.

30:12.609 --> 30:13.577
Iris.

30:13.610 --> 30:14.511
Hello!

30:14.544 --> 30:15.379
Blossom.

30:15.411 --> 30:16.746
Nice to meet you.

30:16.780 --> 30:18.616
And...
Gemini.

30:18.649 --> 30:19.650
Nice name.

30:20.617 --> 30:21.885
Namaste.

30:27.658 --> 30:30.361
Ladies, thank you so much.

30:30.393 --> 30:31.828
You saved my ass.

30:31.861 --> 30:35.265
Now, I hate to run,
but I gotta 23-Skidoo.

30:39.703 --> 30:43.474
It's my pleasure, we'll
see you next time, bye.

30:43.506 --> 30:44.608
Bye.

30:46.976 --> 30:48.012
Hold on a minute.

30:48.044 --> 30:48.879
What?

30:54.884 --> 30:56.786
Okay, there's no
problem, she's fine.

30:56.820 --> 30:57.655
Wait.

30:57.688 --> 30:58.889
Now what?

30:58.921 --> 31:00.723
Try shifting.

31:06.963 --> 31:11.402
Drove a stick for years,
guess this is automatic.

31:25.381 --> 31:27.618
Shouldn't you call
AAA to get that van?

31:27.650 --> 31:28.818
I will, I will.

31:28.851 --> 31:30.720
I just need to get Harry
to his destination.

31:30.754 --> 31:32.323
What's your damn hurry?

31:32.355 --> 31:34.724
Yeah Jay, what's
your damn hurry?

31:34.757 --> 31:37.627
Oh, just my job's on
the line, that's all.

31:37.660 --> 31:41.431
Well, it's not your
fault the van broke down.

31:41.465 --> 31:43.967
And now, you're looking
out for the well being

31:43.999 --> 31:45.969
of your passenger.

31:46.902 --> 31:49.372
I like the way you think.

31:49.406 --> 31:52.376
Okay, okay, okay, settle
down Harry, come on.

31:52.409 --> 31:54.378
So where is it you said
you girls were headed?

31:54.410 --> 31:56.380
We're going to the
Twin Pine Casino.

31:56.412 --> 31:58.481
We are the closing act.

31:58.515 --> 31:59.515
Of course you are.

31:59.548 --> 32:00.750
Of course we are, babe.

32:00.784 --> 32:03.387
You are amazing.
Twin Pine, let's see.

32:03.419 --> 32:04.554
That's in Middletown, isn't it?

32:04.588 --> 32:06.123
Yes it is.

32:06.156 --> 32:08.759
Well, I guess we could
catch a ride with you there,

32:08.792 --> 32:10.861
pick up our rental and
still get to Golden Oaks

32:10.893 --> 32:13.063
and, oh shoot!

32:13.095 --> 32:14.530
I don't have my wallet or phone.

32:14.563 --> 32:17.000
Oh, this just isn't your
day, is it Doll Face?

32:19.636 --> 32:22.740
Hey, what the, where
did you find these?

32:22.773 --> 32:26.577
Sorry kid, I took 'em.
Part of my escape plan.

32:28.011 --> 32:30.481
Harry, I should really be
pissed at you right now,

32:30.514 --> 32:31.715
But...

32:31.748 --> 32:35.151
but I don't know, I guess I
can't blame you, but that's it.

32:35.185 --> 32:37.454
No more Houdini acts, all right?

32:37.486 --> 32:38.121
That's it.

32:38.155 --> 32:40.457
You've got it boss.

32:40.489 --> 32:43.092
So. What do you gals do?

32:44.194 --> 32:47.598
Drive, drive, drive.

32:48.698 --> 32:49.932
Hey George.

32:49.966 --> 32:51.001
Yeah, I'm here.

32:52.869 --> 32:54.605
No, they don't get in until
like five or six today,

32:54.638 --> 32:59.009
so I'm just going to kind of
chill here until they show up.

32:59.042 --> 33:01.512
Yeah, okay, all right, bye.

33:12.823 --> 33:14.492
Wonder if they've
got a bar in here.

33:21.497 --> 33:23.633
Excuse me, what are you doing?

33:23.667 --> 33:24.802
Ladies.

33:26.002 --> 33:27.169
We're going to a hot spring.

33:27.203 --> 33:30.507
We always go to the hot springs
on the way to the casino.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.109
It's so cleansing.

33:32.141 --> 33:33.776
Well, I wouldn't want
you to miss that.

33:33.810 --> 33:35.946
By the way, how long
does this cleansing take?

33:35.978 --> 33:38.148
Oh not long, it's so hot out.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.917
Don't you want to cool off?

33:39.949 --> 33:43.719
Yeah Jay, come on now, why
don't you just live a little?

33:43.753 --> 33:45.989
Yeah, live a little.

33:47.490 --> 33:48.491
All right, all right, all right,

33:48.525 --> 33:50.159
that's enough out
of you Mr. Byrd.

33:50.192 --> 33:51.895
That's enough out of you.

34:11.615 --> 34:13.250
This must be it.

34:13.282 --> 34:14.183
Where are the girls?

34:14.217 --> 34:16.519
Said they were changing.

34:16.552 --> 34:19.255
Hey, you're having an
adventure after all.

34:19.289 --> 34:21.758
Yeah, this is great.

34:21.791 --> 34:27.631
Look, I'm sorry about taking
your wallet and the van.

34:27.664 --> 34:28.232
That's not really like me.

34:28.264 --> 34:30.132
Oh it isn't, huh?

34:30.166 --> 34:31.901
Then, who is it like?

34:32.968 --> 34:34.637
No harm no foul I guess.

34:34.671 --> 34:36.807
As long as they get you
to the church on time.

34:36.840 --> 34:38.809
What am I, a bride groom?

34:38.842 --> 34:42.678
Well, now that you said
it, yeah, I think you are.

34:42.711 --> 34:45.215
You're starting a whole new
life with some restrictions,

34:45.247 --> 34:46.617
but you're going
to love it Harry.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.285
Don't know about that.

34:48.318 --> 34:50.586
Here come the girls.

34:50.619 --> 34:52.522
Hubba, hubba!

34:52.555 --> 34:54.124
Are you sure you should be
looking in that direction?

34:54.157 --> 34:55.124
I mean, with your heart and all.

34:55.157 --> 34:58.027
Get out of here, I can
barely see them anyway.

34:59.963 --> 35:01.598
Aren't you boys coming in?

35:01.631 --> 35:05.002
Oh, no thanks, how
about you, tiger?

35:05.035 --> 35:07.303
The view is fine from here.

35:07.336 --> 35:09.139
Wise choice.

35:09.171 --> 35:11.173
These are natural springs.

35:11.206 --> 35:14.777
Actually used to be a sacred
site to the local Indians.

35:14.811 --> 35:17.180
I mean Native Americans.

35:18.782 --> 35:21.184
You sure you boys don't
want to come on in?

35:21.217 --> 35:22.686
Oh, I'm okay thanks.

35:22.718 --> 35:24.621
A lot of positive
energy right here.

35:24.653 --> 35:27.090
I'm feeling my chakras,
all seven of them.

35:27.122 --> 35:29.325
How about you Harry,
you feel that?

35:41.704 --> 35:44.307
Dispatch, I have an
abandoned van on Marsh Road.

35:44.340 --> 35:46.209
I'm going to check it out.

35:47.977 --> 35:49.947
Reminds me of the old days.

35:49.979 --> 35:51.180
Yeah?

35:51.213 --> 35:52.582
Yeah.

35:52.615 --> 35:53.950
Me and Harriet.

35:55.385 --> 36:00.691
Hey, I just got that - Harry
and Harriet, that's cute.

36:00.724 --> 36:01.725
That's her.

36:06.061 --> 36:07.264
We had this routine.

36:08.664 --> 36:10.266
We used to drive off
Saturday mornings,

36:10.300 --> 36:11.501
didn't know where we were going,

36:11.535 --> 36:14.672
just went. We would end up at
beautiful places like this.

36:16.338 --> 36:17.306
Sounds like fun.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.242
Best days of my life.

36:21.144 --> 36:22.813
So what happened to you?

36:22.845 --> 36:24.046
What do you mean?

36:24.079 --> 36:26.983
You used to be an actor,
now you're a van driver.

36:27.017 --> 36:30.220
And you haven't mentioned your
wife once, what's her name?

36:30.253 --> 36:31.655
Susan.

36:31.688 --> 36:33.189
Nice name.

36:33.222 --> 36:35.224
Susan and I are divorced.

36:36.226 --> 36:37.093
Sorry to hear that.

36:37.126 --> 36:39.295
Yeah, but we had our
good days though.

36:40.430 --> 36:41.698
Bet you did.

36:41.731 --> 36:43.200
We met in college.

36:43.233 --> 36:46.970
We did Oklahoma! together, I
was Curly and she was Laurey.

36:47.003 --> 36:47.803
Nice.

36:47.836 --> 36:49.706
It was, very nice.

36:49.738 --> 36:52.275
We didn't have a care in
the world back then, Harry.

36:52.307 --> 36:54.311
We just lived for today.

36:54.343 --> 36:55.711
Then what?

36:55.744 --> 36:57.313
Oh, you know, the usual.

36:57.347 --> 36:59.850
We got married, had
kids, bought a house,

36:59.883 --> 37:02.686
worked to make money
or tried to anyway.

37:02.718 --> 37:04.755
And then somewhere
along the line,

37:04.787 --> 37:07.624
I don't know when, we just...

37:10.293 --> 37:12.296
...just lost the spark I guess.

37:14.130 --> 37:15.164
Too bad.

37:17.467 --> 37:22.039
Yeah. What was
your secret, Harry?

37:22.072 --> 37:24.675
How did you and Harriet
have such a good marriage?

37:26.443 --> 37:29.446
It was good, but
don't kid yourself.

37:29.479 --> 37:33.050
We had hard times
too, plenty of them.

37:33.082 --> 37:36.186
We just hung in there.

37:38.387 --> 37:41.357
Maybe you should get
back into acting.

37:41.390 --> 37:44.293
I told you, Harry
that's over for me.

37:44.327 --> 37:45.329
You're a natural.

37:46.296 --> 37:47.330
I wish you were my agent.

37:47.363 --> 37:49.800
Better yet, a casting director.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.934
Your only mistake
was you gave up.

37:51.968 --> 37:53.370
You think?

37:53.403 --> 37:56.040
You may think I'm blowing
smoke up your ass, but I'm not.

37:57.273 --> 38:00.376
Life is too damn short not
to do what you really want.

38:07.150 --> 38:08.818
Let's go swimming.

38:08.852 --> 38:10.153
Okay.

38:10.186 --> 38:11.021
Okay.

38:26.503 --> 38:27.903
Excuse me, I'm sorry,

38:27.936 --> 38:29.839
but do you have any
word on Harry Byrd?

38:29.872 --> 38:31.008
Harry Byrd?
Yeah.

38:32.976 --> 38:35.912
Nothing for Harry.
Are you Charles?

38:35.945 --> 38:36.747
Yes.

38:42.952 --> 38:43.754
Shit.

38:48.858 --> 38:52.262
George, yeah it's Charles,
what the hell is going on, man?

38:53.829 --> 38:54.497
They've found what?

38:56.265 --> 38:58.367
All right, and there
is no sign of my dad?

38:59.535 --> 39:00.903
What about the driver?

39:01.905 --> 39:03.006
Okay, okay, well
then what the hell

39:03.039 --> 39:04.374
am I supposed to do here, man?

39:04.407 --> 39:07.077
I mean, what the fuck
am I supposed to do?

39:08.077 --> 39:09.212
All right, I'll
wait for your call.

39:09.244 --> 39:11.013
Yeah, I'll wait for
you to call me back.

39:11.046 --> 39:13.150
Okay, bye.

39:33.235 --> 39:34.371
Hello, Golden Oaks?

39:34.403 --> 39:36.072
Hey, good evening.

39:36.104 --> 39:39.309
This is Jay Butler, J as in
bird, Butler - never mind.

39:39.342 --> 39:43.345
Listen, I was due in with a
Mr. Harry Byrd at around fi-

39:43.378 --> 39:44.346
Oh, you know the name?

39:44.380 --> 39:47.050
Great, listen, no worries.

39:47.082 --> 39:49.385
Our van broke down, but
I'm about to rent a car

39:49.418 --> 39:53.489
and so we should be there
about, about two hours, okay?

39:53.523 --> 39:56.026
Great, thank you so much.

39:56.059 --> 39:59.162
Okay, let's go, we are set.

39:59.195 --> 40:00.597
Do we have time to
play a few slots?

40:00.630 --> 40:02.231
Slots, absolutely not,

40:02.264 --> 40:04.834
say goodbye to your
girlfriends, Harry.

40:04.867 --> 40:07.871
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

40:09.372 --> 40:12.242
Are you guys sure you don't
want to stay for our show?

40:12.275 --> 40:14.276
Yeah, it's going
to be a humdinger.

40:14.309 --> 40:15.978
Hubba hubba.

40:16.012 --> 40:17.546
Thanks, thanks ladies,
another time and listen,

40:17.579 --> 40:19.315
thank you all for the lift.

40:19.349 --> 40:21.852
We really couldn't have
done it without you.

40:21.885 --> 40:23.220
I owe you big time.

40:25.188 --> 40:26.456
Okay, Harry, let's go.

40:26.488 --> 40:28.391
Bye girls, safe trip.

40:36.365 --> 40:38.432
What do you mean you
don't have a rental?

40:38.434 --> 40:41.271
I'm sorry sir, we may have
a return later tonight.

40:41.303 --> 40:43.273
If not, we'll definitely
have one tomorrow.

40:44.506 --> 40:46.976
Perhaps you'd like
to stay the night?

40:47.010 --> 40:48.311
Yes, perhaps we can.

40:48.343 --> 40:50.313
No, we can't.

40:50.345 --> 40:52.081
What about Uber or Lyft?

40:53.349 --> 40:55.986
You can try, but it might
take them hours to get here,

40:56.019 --> 40:57.421
if you can even get one.

40:59.389 --> 41:02.626
Oh no, no, no, no, okay, okay.

41:02.659 --> 41:05.028
Think, think, okay
Harry, come on.

41:05.061 --> 41:06.028
Harry?

41:06.061 --> 41:08.497
Harry, Harry, Harry!

41:12.367 --> 41:15.537
Come on you fecocta contraption!

41:15.570 --> 41:17.539
I've been playing you for
three goddamn hours now.

41:17.572 --> 41:19.375
You're tighter than
a nun's asshole.

41:22.378 --> 41:24.381
Excuse me, mister.

41:24.414 --> 41:26.182
This afternoon I
saw this machine

41:26.215 --> 41:29.352
pay out three, three
jackpots, but me?

41:29.385 --> 41:30.620
Forget about it.

41:30.653 --> 41:32.222
Mind if I take a spin?

41:32.255 --> 41:33.356
Sure, be my guest.

41:33.389 --> 41:34.892
Maybe you'll bring me luck.

41:42.965 --> 41:44.601
Three cherries, not bad.

41:46.735 --> 41:47.536
It's okay.

41:47.570 --> 41:49.005
There you are.

41:49.037 --> 41:51.407
Harry, you have got
to stop wandering off.

41:51.441 --> 41:53.143
I can't take this anymore.

41:53.175 --> 41:55.244
Oh my God!

41:55.278 --> 41:57.546
If it isn't my favorite
nephew-in-law Jay!

41:57.579 --> 42:00.282
As in jay bird, and whatever.

42:00.316 --> 42:02.252
Aunt Evelyn, what
are you doing here?

42:02.285 --> 42:04.321
I took the bus out for the day.

42:04.354 --> 42:07.057
Play the slots, see the show.

42:07.090 --> 42:09.459
You should see the floozies
they got coming here.

42:09.492 --> 42:11.361
We know all about it.

42:11.394 --> 42:13.563
We? What are you doing here?

42:13.595 --> 42:16.032
Oh, well I'm driving
my friend Harry here...

42:16.064 --> 42:16.700
Hello.
L'Chaim.

42:16.733 --> 42:18.468
To the Golden Oaks.

42:18.501 --> 42:21.171
The Golden Oaks, you're
going the wrong way.

42:21.204 --> 42:22.472
That's not anywhere near here.

42:22.505 --> 42:23.707
Let me tell you, you need to...

42:23.740 --> 42:25.575
We know Aunt Evelyn.

42:25.608 --> 42:27.376
Mind if I take another spin?

42:27.410 --> 42:29.412
Sure, you're good luck.

42:29.445 --> 42:31.113
No wait.

42:36.586 --> 42:39.555
Jackpot, a hundred dollars!

42:41.224 --> 42:43.059
Hey, how about that!

42:43.092 --> 42:45.361
Do I have the touch or what?

42:45.394 --> 42:47.197
That's really wonderful
Harry, but listen...

42:47.229 --> 42:49.465
Hey, do you mind
if I play the slots

42:49.499 --> 42:51.668
while you figure out
what you gotta do?

42:51.700 --> 42:53.269
Where do I get change?

42:53.302 --> 42:54.104
Over there.

42:55.470 --> 42:57.373
I don't think it...

42:57.407 --> 43:00.443
Well okay, but I thought you
said you didn't have any money.

43:05.381 --> 43:07.117
Oh, club soda, please.

43:07.150 --> 43:08.017
Thank you!

43:11.119 --> 43:12.421
Hey there, Doll Face.

43:12.454 --> 43:13.655
Hey, Red!

43:13.689 --> 43:15.358
I thought you guys
were taking off!

43:15.390 --> 43:17.494
I'm working on it,
I just need a break.

43:17.526 --> 43:19.262
Yeah, you look like
you can use one.

43:19.294 --> 43:20.662
You're telling me.

43:20.695 --> 43:21.597
You mind if I join you?

43:21.631 --> 43:24.467
Hey, help yourself, be my guest.

43:24.499 --> 43:25.702
You look nice.

43:25.735 --> 43:27.470
Well thank you,
the usual, Honey.

43:27.503 --> 43:30.273
No offense, but why do
you call everyone Sugar

43:30.305 --> 43:32.175
or Honey or Doll Face?

43:32.207 --> 43:34.209
Well, I'm just
trying to sweeten up

43:34.242 --> 43:35.511
a sour world there, Sugar.

43:36.579 --> 43:37.714
Now those are my PG names.

43:37.747 --> 43:40.082
I can give you my
other ones if you want.

43:40.115 --> 43:41.284
That's okay.

43:41.316 --> 43:43.253
Oh, thank you, darling.

43:44.287 --> 43:45.288
Thank you.

43:46.322 --> 43:49.392
Cheers. To new adventures.

43:49.425 --> 43:50.560
Uh, maybe.

43:55.264 --> 43:57.633
You know Jay, can I offer
you a piece of advice?

43:58.800 --> 44:00.402
Wouldn't hurt.

44:00.436 --> 44:03.106
Everything is gonna
work out just fine.

44:03.139 --> 44:04.541
It always does.

44:04.573 --> 44:09.378
Maybe for you it does, but
lately for me, I don't know.

44:11.447 --> 44:13.349
Look I gotta go,
thank you so much.

44:13.381 --> 44:16.351
And oh, I forgot to pay.

44:16.385 --> 44:18.787
This is for both
and keep the change.

44:18.820 --> 44:21.390
Oh, thank you darling,
I appreciate it.

44:21.423 --> 44:22.724
Break a leg, Shweetheart.

44:22.758 --> 44:24.394
Oh, bless you.

44:24.427 --> 44:25.562
Bye-bye.
Bye.

44:32.901 --> 44:33.736
There you are!

44:36.472 --> 44:38.307
So where do we go
from here, Chief?

44:38.340 --> 44:40.409
Well, I just left a
message with Golden Oaks

44:40.443 --> 44:42.544
told them where we are,
that we have no wheels,

44:42.577 --> 44:45.280
but that you are safe and sound.

44:45.314 --> 44:46.515
So we're staying?

44:46.548 --> 44:49.184
Until we get a car, tonight
or first thing in the morning.

44:49.218 --> 44:52.188
Great, let's catch
the girlie show!

44:52.220 --> 44:53.389
You'd like that.

44:53.421 --> 44:55.390
Who wouldn't, did
you see that Blossom?

44:55.423 --> 44:57.326
She's a va voom.

44:57.360 --> 44:58.428
A va voom?

44:58.461 --> 44:59.329
You said it.

44:59.361 --> 45:02.231
No you did, never mind.

45:02.264 --> 45:04.566
You boys mind if I join you?

45:04.599 --> 45:06.268
Come sit, sit.

45:06.302 --> 45:09.405
Harry, you remember my Aunt
Evelyn, on my ex-wife's side.

45:09.438 --> 45:12.675
Yeah, Susan is my
niece, but I love Jay

45:12.707 --> 45:13.910
if he were my own blood.

45:13.943 --> 45:16.678
Did you know Jay is a
very talented actor?

45:16.711 --> 45:18.380
Was, Evelyn.

45:18.414 --> 45:19.616
I've heard.

45:19.648 --> 45:23.485
I know Susan got fed up
with the uncertainty,

45:23.519 --> 45:28.525
the instability, the gas,
but you had other problems.

45:29.959 --> 45:32.361
Thanks Evelyn, we don't
need to hear that now.

45:32.394 --> 45:36.265
Listen, I told Susan, I said
to her, he is who he is.

45:36.298 --> 45:37.499
That's who you married.

45:37.534 --> 45:40.736
Would you rather be hitched
to some accountant like I was?

45:40.769 --> 45:42.438
God, rest his soul.

45:42.470 --> 45:45.909
Murray, you were a good man,
but not the most exciting.

45:45.941 --> 45:48.311
You want fish?

45:48.343 --> 45:51.280
Thanks, I ordered a sandwich.

45:51.314 --> 45:53.316
Yes, this is a
restaurant, Evelyn.

45:53.349 --> 45:56.352
Yeah, did you see what they're
charging for a coke? Gonnifs.

45:57.753 --> 46:00.289
Want to play some more slots?

46:00.322 --> 46:01.423
Are you kidding?

46:01.456 --> 46:02.691
You've got the Midas touch.

46:02.724 --> 46:05.427
Don't you have a
bus to catch Evelyn?

46:05.461 --> 46:07.664
I got a couple hours left.

46:07.697 --> 46:08.898
Would you excuse me.

46:08.930 --> 46:11.168
I'm going to see if
they have any mustard.

46:13.436 --> 46:14.437
Nice lady.

46:14.470 --> 46:15.605
She is a character.

46:16.539 --> 46:18.874
So, have you thought about it?

46:18.907 --> 46:20.008
What?

46:20.043 --> 46:22.445
Taking me to Olompali. I'd
make it worth your while.

46:22.477 --> 46:24.380
Harry, what are
you talking about?

46:24.412 --> 46:25.514
You know I can't do that.

46:25.548 --> 46:28.885
You don't get it,
you're my only hope.

46:28.918 --> 46:31.954
Would you deny a dying
man his last wish?

46:31.988 --> 46:34.424
Whoa, whoa whoa, don't
guilt trip me, Harry.

46:34.456 --> 46:36.325
You are not dying.

46:36.358 --> 46:37.559
We're all dying,

46:37.593 --> 46:39.562
never know what day
will be your last.

46:39.595 --> 46:43.566
Listen, I used to live for
today and look where it got me.

46:43.599 --> 46:45.434
Looks pretty good to me.

46:45.468 --> 46:47.670
I'm divorced, failed
at three careers

46:47.702 --> 46:49.871
and don't have a pot to piss in.

46:49.905 --> 46:53.443
Looking at it that way, it
seems like a rotten deal.

46:53.476 --> 46:54.910
But?

46:54.943 --> 46:58.547
It's always something or
never anything, you choose.

46:58.581 --> 47:00.249
I don't follow.

47:00.282 --> 47:02.384
You can always look
for what's missing

47:02.418 --> 47:04.921
or appreciate what you got.

47:04.954 --> 47:07.289
From where I see it,
you got it pretty good.

47:07.322 --> 47:08.624
You're still young relatively,

47:08.657 --> 47:11.827
you have your health
and something you love.

47:11.860 --> 47:12.628
What?

47:12.662 --> 47:13.963
You know what.

47:13.996 --> 47:16.398
You mean acting.
That didn't work out.

47:16.432 --> 47:20.602
Yet. You can't change
your past, forget it.

47:20.635 --> 47:23.372
But nobody knows what
the future holds.

47:24.807 --> 47:28.912
Got mustard, relish and
look at this pickle, huh!

47:32.847 --> 47:34.316
Hi, any word yet?

47:34.349 --> 47:38.387
Yes, your father is at
the Twin Pine Casino.

47:40.322 --> 47:42.457
The Twin Pine Casino.

47:42.490 --> 47:44.393
This is completely unacceptable.

47:49.432 --> 47:51.301
How do I get to the
Twin Pine Casino?

48:02.077 --> 48:05.314
I should have known better
than to book a burlesque act.

48:05.347 --> 48:07.916
If they don't show up,
you don't get paid.

48:07.950 --> 48:10.419
Please Mr. Wu, just
let us do our act.

48:10.452 --> 48:11.586
You know I'm good for it.

48:11.619 --> 48:14.356
Excuse me, is there
something wrong?

48:14.389 --> 48:15.957
Who are you?

48:15.990 --> 48:17.959
I'm a friend of Red's,
Red, what's going on?

48:17.992 --> 48:20.462
Well, our comedy
act, Fritz and Hans,

48:20.496 --> 48:21.898
they were supposed
to meet us here,

48:21.930 --> 48:23.967
but they're drunk
in Bakersfield.

48:25.401 --> 48:26.903
Surely something can be done.

48:26.936 --> 48:29.405
No comedy act, no gig.

48:29.438 --> 48:33.742
You figure it out and don't
call me Shirley, I am Jimmy Wu.

48:35.778 --> 48:37.380
Nice guy.

48:37.412 --> 48:39.349
Well, I mean he isn't so bad.

48:39.381 --> 48:41.050
We did promise him a comedy act,

48:41.082 --> 48:42.452
but what are you going to do?

48:42.485 --> 48:43.452
That's a tough break, Red.

48:43.485 --> 48:44.653
It is.

48:44.686 --> 48:47.055
You know what, didn't
you say something

48:47.088 --> 48:48.390
about you were in entertainment?

48:48.423 --> 48:49.858
Me, I was an actor.

48:49.892 --> 48:52.562
Oh, well can't you just
act like you're a comedian?

48:52.595 --> 48:53.696
In theory.

48:53.729 --> 48:55.098
Oh, but we need a duo.

48:55.131 --> 48:56.132
Hey hey, wait...

48:56.164 --> 48:57.032
What about the old man?

48:57.066 --> 48:58.868
Harry, what about him?

48:58.901 --> 49:01.571
Yeah, you two can act like
you're comedians. Perfect.

49:01.604 --> 49:04.407
No, no, no, we're not a duo,
we're not a comedy team.

49:04.439 --> 49:07.142
There's no script, why am
I even talking about this?

49:07.175 --> 49:08.643
Don't worry, just breathe.

49:08.677 --> 49:10.780
All you have to do
is just get on stage

49:10.813 --> 49:11.981
tell a few jokes.

49:12.014 --> 49:13.983
Bada bing, bada
boom, 200 big ones.

49:14.015 --> 49:16.084
Red, it's very enticing.

49:16.117 --> 49:18.487
Really, and I'm
flattered, but I'm sorry.

49:18.521 --> 49:20.723
It is absolutely
out of the question.

49:20.756 --> 49:21.591
I'm sorry, dear.

49:22.791 --> 49:23.625
Jay...

49:26.028 --> 49:28.430
All right Harry,
this is a big one.

49:28.463 --> 49:29.865
Sure is.

49:29.898 --> 49:32.467
Feeling lucky?

49:32.501 --> 49:34.470
You know it.

49:35.970 --> 49:36.805
Wait!

49:38.474 --> 49:41.544
Okay, I swear Murry, I
swear I'm giving half

49:41.577 --> 49:43.446
of this to the Yeshiva
and you can tell me

49:43.479 --> 49:45.448
to.

49:45.481 --> 49:48.450
Okay, amen.

49:48.483 --> 49:49.119
Okay.

49:55.490 --> 49:58.960
It's my fault, I
jinxed it, I know it.

49:58.994 --> 50:01.798
That's okay, we'll
get it next time.

50:05.034 --> 50:06.869
Oh, Mr. Butler, good news.

50:06.901 --> 50:08.503
What?

50:08.537 --> 50:10.473
A car just came in, they're
cleaning it right now.

50:10.506 --> 50:11.974
Should be ready for you shortly.

50:12.006 --> 50:13.809
Oh great, thank you so much!

50:13.843 --> 50:14.677
Of course.

50:16.177 --> 50:17.078
Dang it!

50:17.111 --> 50:18.648
Did you see that, so close!

50:18.680 --> 50:19.948
Two jackpots, and then pfft...

50:19.981 --> 50:21.450
A lemon!

50:22.651 --> 50:25.988
Hey, come on Harry, get your
things, we've got a car.

50:26.021 --> 50:27.055
What about the girlie show?

50:27.088 --> 50:29.191
Don't worry, it's not
going to happen, it's off.

50:29.224 --> 50:30.860
Off, why?

50:30.892 --> 50:33.595
The comedy duo, they flaked out.

50:33.628 --> 50:34.831
What?

50:34.863 --> 50:37.166
And get this, they
asked me to fill in.

50:37.198 --> 50:38.200
What did you say?

50:38.233 --> 50:39.168
No, of course not.

50:39.200 --> 50:40.101
Why the hell not?

50:40.135 --> 50:42.604
Oh, I don't know, about
a million reasons.

50:42.637 --> 50:45.240
I didn't train at Juilliard
to be a burlesque warm-up act.

50:45.273 --> 50:47.976
A lot of great comics
worked in burlesque.

50:48.010 --> 50:48.977
Phil Silvers.

50:49.010 --> 50:49.945
Sid Caesar.

50:49.979 --> 50:51.180
Danny Kaye.

50:51.213 --> 50:53.548
I don't care if Tom
Cruise worked burlesque,

50:53.581 --> 50:55.250
I'm an actor, not a clown.

50:55.284 --> 50:56.486
Let's go.

50:57.151 --> 50:57.952
Now what?

50:57.985 --> 51:00.956
Don't you see, this
is your chance.

51:00.990 --> 51:01.756
For what?

51:01.789 --> 51:03.258
To get back in the game!

51:03.291 --> 51:05.560
You were always so funny, Jay.

51:05.593 --> 51:07.662
What do you got to lose?

51:07.695 --> 51:10.632
How about my dignity,
my self-respect?

51:10.666 --> 51:13.503
Never mind, I lost those
a long time ago, let's go.

51:15.204 --> 51:17.707
I'm disappointed in you Jay.

51:19.307 --> 51:21.010
Harry, for God's sake!

51:21.043 --> 51:22.278
Let him go.

51:22.311 --> 51:24.013
I can't Evelyn, I'm
responsible for him.

51:24.046 --> 51:25.982
Just for a minute.

51:26.014 --> 51:28.283
You know, he really
wanted to see that show?

51:28.316 --> 51:30.253
Me not so much, not my thing,

51:30.285 --> 51:32.287
a bunch of women
flashing their boobies,

51:32.320 --> 51:34.523
but Harry was looking
forward to it.

51:34.557 --> 51:37.159
Evelyn, Evelyn, to see the show,

51:37.191 --> 51:38.727
we have to be in the show.

51:38.760 --> 51:41.130
So what, would it hurt
for you to go up there

51:41.162 --> 51:43.064
and fool around for
a couple of minutes?

51:43.097 --> 51:45.200
This isn't Carnegie Hall.

51:45.233 --> 51:46.369
I don't know.

51:46.401 --> 51:51.974
Listen, my biggest fear has
always been doing standup.

51:52.006 --> 51:53.675
What if I go up
there and I bomb it?

51:54.309 --> 51:55.210
- Bomb it?
- Yeah.

51:55.244 --> 51:57.246
I remember your kid's
birthday parties,

51:57.278 --> 52:00.516
you used to sing,
dance and tell jokes.

52:02.017 --> 52:02.885
You were good, Jay.

52:02.918 --> 52:06.289
Evelyn, I love you,
but this is crazy.

52:06.322 --> 52:07.789
I got to get Harry.

52:44.793 --> 52:48.564
Here he is now, hail
the conquering hero!

52:50.331 --> 52:53.368
Jay, this means so much to us.

52:53.401 --> 52:54.903
What?

52:54.936 --> 52:56.671
Well Harry here says that
you're going to fill in

52:56.704 --> 52:58.239
for Fritz and Hanz for us.

52:58.273 --> 52:59.207
What?

52:59.240 --> 53:00.610
I have your costumes right here.

53:00.642 --> 53:02.278
This is such a
good karma for you.

53:02.311 --> 53:06.682
Boys, you both earned yourself
as super deluxe lap dance.

53:06.715 --> 53:10.019
No, no, no lap dances,
that won't be necessary.

53:10.052 --> 53:10.986
Why not?

53:11.019 --> 53:13.288
It won't be necessary because...

53:15.023 --> 53:15.857
Because...

53:17.825 --> 53:19.260
Oh, what the hell!

53:21.363 --> 53:24.300
Now you're talking, baby.

53:24.332 --> 53:26.635
Okay, so you guys
can change in our RV

53:26.668 --> 53:28.336
because we have a green
room here ready for us.

53:28.369 --> 53:30.705
Why can't we be in the
green room with you?

53:30.738 --> 53:32.307
Don't worry, you'll
get to see our boobs

53:32.340 --> 53:34.142
soon enough, grandpa.

53:35.376 --> 53:37.212
Just a second, aren't
you going to tell us

53:37.246 --> 53:38.914
what we're supposed to do?

53:38.947 --> 53:41.718
Oh well, no, you guys just
make it up, I trust you.

53:43.686 --> 53:45.821
Let the divine guide you.

53:45.854 --> 53:49.425
Make some, divine, great.

53:49.457 --> 53:50.726
This'll help.

53:51.894 --> 53:54.296
Oh, no thanks, where
did you get that?

53:54.329 --> 53:55.965
You sure you should be drinking?

53:55.997 --> 53:57.832
They've been telling
me not to drink, smoke,

53:57.865 --> 54:01.070
to gamble, eat red meat or fool
around with women for years.

54:01.102 --> 54:02.303
You know what I say?

54:02.336 --> 54:03.805
No and I'm afraid to ask.

54:03.838 --> 54:06.909
Screw that noise, I got
nothing left to lose.

54:06.941 --> 54:08.343
I see your point.

54:12.381 --> 54:14.250
Seriously, Harry, what
are we going to do?

54:14.282 --> 54:16.685
I can sing a little.

54:16.718 --> 54:17.952
Really?

54:17.985 --> 54:20.055
Yeah, I used to be
in a musical revue

54:20.088 --> 54:21.856
that one of my tenants put on.

54:21.889 --> 54:23.058
No kidding!

54:23.092 --> 54:25.093
Okay, okay, that's
great, that's a start.

54:26.794 --> 54:28.130
What about you, what
are you going to do?

54:28.162 --> 54:29.965
Well, I can sing
and dance a little

54:29.997 --> 54:33.936
and I did try stand up
once a very long time ago.

54:33.968 --> 54:36.037
Like Red Skelton,
he was terrific.

54:36.070 --> 54:38.473
Yeah he was, but
nothing like him.

54:38.506 --> 54:42.010
Here, Iris gave them
to me to give to you.

54:42.043 --> 54:43.145
Maybe it'll help.

54:45.213 --> 54:46.448
What am I doing?

54:46.481 --> 54:47.849
I suck.

54:47.883 --> 54:49.218
What's the matter, you afraid?

54:49.251 --> 54:51.053
Well duh, yeah.

54:51.086 --> 54:53.255
What if we go out there
Harry and nobody laughs?

54:53.287 --> 54:55.056
What if they boo
us off the stage?

54:55.090 --> 54:57.325
Relax, you'll do fine.

54:57.358 --> 55:01.831
Harry, this is not what I
imagined for myself at this age.

55:01.863 --> 55:03.331
What did you imagine?

55:03.365 --> 55:04.867
That I'd have things
under control.

55:04.900 --> 55:07.269
You know, be successful,
confident, carefree.

55:07.302 --> 55:10.206
That's what happens when
you get older, right?

55:10.238 --> 55:11.106
Pah!

55:11.139 --> 55:12.307
Pah?

55:12.340 --> 55:15.276
You always feel like a scared
kid, that never goes away.

55:15.309 --> 55:17.912
It's what you do
with it that matters.

55:17.945 --> 55:19.481
I'm sorry, I didn't
sign up for this.

55:21.115 --> 55:25.454
It's called life and this
is it, love it or leave it.

55:29.457 --> 55:31.059
All right, we're
going to do this.

55:31.093 --> 55:32.328
Okay, so here's what happens.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.996
You're going to go out
there and you'll sing

55:34.028 --> 55:36.331
your little song, whatever that
is, I'll leave it up to you.

55:36.365 --> 55:38.901
Make it clean then I'll
come out and I'll...

55:46.407 --> 55:48.209
George, yeah, it's
me, I'm almost there.

55:48.242 --> 55:50.945
Look, I still have time to get
these papers signed, right?

55:50.979 --> 55:52.247
Okay, good, good.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.183
I cannot-I cannot believe
he took him to a casino.

55:55.217 --> 55:58.019
When this whole thing is
over, I want to sue his ass!

55:58.052 --> 55:59.255
You understand me?

55:59.287 --> 56:00.555
Good, all right.

56:00.588 --> 56:01.823
Yes, bye.

56:05.160 --> 56:05.995
Oh God.

56:16.305 --> 56:17.306
How do I look?

56:17.338 --> 56:19.174
Honestly, ridiculous.

56:19.207 --> 56:21.209
I hope nobody I know is here.

56:22.410 --> 56:23.611
Listen, as soon as
the show is over,

56:23.646 --> 56:26.015
we're getting in the car and
going straight to Golden Oaks.

56:26.048 --> 56:27.249
That's the deal, right?

56:27.282 --> 56:28.082
Yeah, yeah.

56:28.115 --> 56:28.983
Good.

56:29.017 --> 56:31.053
Hello, hello, the flittchen

56:31.086 --> 56:32.822
are waiting for you inside.

56:32.854 --> 56:34.322
The show is going
to start, come on!

56:34.356 --> 56:36.358
Aunt Evelyn, I thought
you had a bus to catch.

56:36.390 --> 56:38.360
And miss you doing
your show, no way.

56:38.392 --> 56:39.961
I booked a room.

56:39.994 --> 56:43.832
Hey, you look like
Abbott and Costello.

56:43.865 --> 56:44.934
Who's on first?

56:44.967 --> 56:46.168
What's on second?

56:46.200 --> 56:48.137
Oh, what's his name is
on third, is that right?

56:48.169 --> 56:48.970
I don't know.

56:49.003 --> 56:49.904
I dunno either.

56:49.938 --> 56:51.140
No, I don't know is on third.

56:51.173 --> 56:51.974
What?

56:52.006 --> 56:53.041
He's on second.

56:53.075 --> 56:54.543
Never mind, let's go.

56:54.575 --> 56:57.880
Wait, you got schmutz
on your blouse.

57:01.383 --> 57:03.319
So you're going to go out and
you're going to sing a song

57:03.352 --> 57:06.222
and after you sing the song,
I'm gonna come out and...

57:09.224 --> 57:10.124
Hubba hubba.

57:10.159 --> 57:12.327
Was there a clearance
sale on feathers?

57:12.360 --> 57:15.330
You girls look absolutely
fabulous, whoa!

57:15.363 --> 57:16.965
Thank you, sweetheart.

57:16.999 --> 57:19.368
Okay so listen, so the
manager will come on

57:19.401 --> 57:22.371
and he'll introduce us first
and we'll do our first routine,

57:22.403 --> 57:24.005
okay, then after
that he comes back

57:24.039 --> 57:27.142
and he'll introduce you
for the comedy interlude.

57:27.175 --> 57:28.177
Are you ready?

57:28.209 --> 57:29.410
Hell no.

57:29.443 --> 57:32.014
Don't listen to him,
we'll knock 'em dead.

57:32.046 --> 57:33.381
I trust you.

57:33.414 --> 57:35.483
Thanks, Red.
Thanks, baby.

57:56.470 --> 57:58.539
Thank you!

57:58.572 --> 58:00.441
Thank you very much.

58:00.474 --> 58:02.477
Thank
you very much.

58:02.510 --> 58:05.179
Welcome to the Twin
Pine big stage!

58:05.213 --> 58:07.548
I am your host, Jimmy Wu.

58:07.581 --> 58:12.220
Now we have a surprise for
you, a neo-burlesque revue.

58:12.253 --> 58:14.055
What does that mean?

58:14.088 --> 58:17.525
Please welcome Pussy
Gato and the Kittenettes!

1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:17.079
Thank you, Pussy, thank you.
That was unique to say the least.

1:00:17.111 --> 1:00:19.581
Now while the Kittenettes get
ready for their next number,

1:00:19.613 --> 1:00:22.050
I want to introduce
the world famous

1:00:22.084 --> 1:00:24.186
comedy team of Hands and Feet!

1:00:24.218 --> 1:00:26.387
Let's give them a warm welcome!

1:00:29.224 --> 1:00:32.528
Thank you, thank you,
Mr. Wu, thank you.

1:00:34.296 --> 1:00:37.399
Wow hi, good evening, good
evening ladies and gentleman

1:00:37.432 --> 1:00:39.435
it's so nice to be back here

1:00:39.468 --> 1:00:43.439
at the Twin Pine Hotel
and Casino, right Hanz?

1:00:43.472 --> 1:00:46.075
You betcha!

1:00:46.108 --> 1:00:47.409
All right, all
right, you know Hanz,

1:00:47.441 --> 1:00:48.543
he's going to start
us off tonight

1:00:48.577 --> 1:00:50.678
with a little song,
aren't you Hanzey?

1:00:50.711 --> 1:00:51.713
What's it going to be?

1:00:51.746 --> 1:00:54.383
Hell if I know, whoa!

1:00:54.416 --> 1:00:56.385
He's such a joker, isn't he?

1:00:56.418 --> 1:00:58.720
Well Hanzey, why
don't you surprise us?

1:00:58.753 --> 1:01:01.689
All right, here's
something we used to sing

1:01:01.722 --> 1:01:03.425
when I was a kid.

1:01:03.457 --> 1:01:04.293
A kid?

1:01:05.559 --> 1:01:10.465
♪ Swanee, how I love, how I
love you, my dear old Swanee ♪

1:01:12.901 --> 1:01:18.107
♪ I'd give the world to be
among the folks at D-I-X-I-E ♪

1:01:19.240 --> 1:01:21.776
♪ Even though my mammy
is waiting for me ♪

1:01:21.809 --> 1:01:26.414
♪ Praying for me down
by the old Swanee ♪

1:01:31.385 --> 1:01:34.355
Hi, I'm looking for a
Harry Byrd, Harry Byrd.

1:01:34.389 --> 1:01:35.657
Does that sound familiar?

1:01:35.689 --> 1:01:37.392
It's a tall guy, a tall old guy.

1:01:37.425 --> 1:01:39.428
He's like 80 years old,
he's got white hair,

1:01:39.461 --> 1:01:40.596
kind of slicked back.

1:01:40.628 --> 1:01:41.529
You know what, never mind.

1:01:41.563 --> 1:01:43.198
I'll find him myself, thank you.

1:01:43.231 --> 1:01:44.765
Thank you very much
for your service.

1:01:44.798 --> 1:01:46.434
Have a nice day.

1:01:46.468 --> 1:01:48.604
Take it away, kid!

1:01:48.637 --> 1:01:49.872
Right, right.

1:01:49.905 --> 1:01:51.406
So folks, here we go.

1:01:51.439 --> 1:01:53.142
Hey, how about some jokes?

1:01:53.175 --> 1:01:54.343
Oh, here's a good one.

1:01:54.376 --> 1:01:56.278
A horse walks into a barn.

1:01:56.311 --> 1:02:00.349
I mean a bar, and the bartender
says, why the long face?

1:02:01.883 --> 1:02:04.352
Okay okay, you probably
want some dirty jokes.

1:02:04.385 --> 1:02:07.421
I bet you do because
you look like a dirty...

1:02:10.392 --> 1:02:12.294
So here's a dirty joke.

1:02:12.327 --> 1:02:14.897
A white horse fell in the mud!

1:02:14.930 --> 1:02:17.332
Oh, that's a killer!

1:02:17.365 --> 1:02:19.535
The one with the
long face, right?

1:02:20.802 --> 1:02:23.338
Oh come on folks, the
girls are backstage.

1:02:23.371 --> 1:02:25.407
They're putting on a little
less to give you a little more!

1:02:25.439 --> 1:02:26.441
Give me a break.

1:02:26.474 --> 1:02:28.242
I want my money back!

1:02:30.945 --> 1:02:32.514
This isn't working.

1:02:32.546 --> 1:02:36.217
Oh, get rid of that.

1:02:36.251 --> 1:02:41.256
Say, I was noticing,
I was noticing...

1:02:42.724 --> 1:02:43.592
What?

1:02:43.624 --> 1:02:45.193
Your pants!

1:02:45.227 --> 1:02:46.428
My pants?

1:02:46.461 --> 1:02:50.365
Yeah, your pants,
they look kinda tight.

1:02:50.398 --> 1:02:51.233
What?

1:02:51.265 --> 1:02:53.434
Oh, yes, my pants!

1:02:53.468 --> 1:02:54.703
They're kind of tight!

1:02:54.735 --> 1:02:57.538
They're very tight,
you want to know why?

1:02:57.572 --> 1:02:59.707
I'm not sure I do!

1:02:59.740 --> 1:03:02.311
Well I'll tell you why!

1:03:02.343 --> 1:03:06.747
It's because, because
Nurse Nice is here!

1:03:06.780 --> 1:03:08.750
Nurse Nice?

1:03:10.452 --> 1:03:11.919
Yes, Nurse Nice.

1:03:13.488 --> 1:03:17.359
She's right over there!

1:03:17.392 --> 1:03:19.561
Right over there?

1:03:19.593 --> 1:03:21.329
Come on folks, bring her on!

1:03:21.363 --> 1:03:24.233
Nurse Nice, Nurse Nice!

1:03:43.985 --> 1:03:48.957
Woo, are you boys
ready to party?

1:03:50.659 --> 1:03:53.394
Oh yeah!

1:03:54.361 --> 1:03:57.265
Well hold this for a second.

1:03:57.298 --> 1:03:57.932
Yeah.

1:03:57.965 --> 1:03:59.367
Ooh.

1:04:02.803 --> 1:04:05.874
Are you all ready to party?

1:05:17.010 --> 1:05:18.479
You did great!

1:05:18.512 --> 1:05:21.449
Thank you, thank you so much!

1:05:21.483 --> 1:05:23.485
What did I tell you?

1:05:23.517 --> 1:05:24.352
I know, I know!

1:05:24.385 --> 1:05:25.387
Dad!

1:05:26.621 --> 1:05:28.389
What the hell is going on here?

1:05:28.423 --> 1:05:30.691
Take it easy, it
was all my idea.

1:05:30.724 --> 1:05:31.959
Oh yeah, I don't doubt that.

1:05:31.992 --> 1:05:33.728
But your job is to make
sure he doesn't act out

1:05:33.762 --> 1:05:35.430
all his crazy ideas.

1:05:35.463 --> 1:05:37.399
I'm sorry, it's
Charles, isn't it?

1:05:37.432 --> 1:05:38.767
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1:05:38.800 --> 1:05:39.935
Just cut the crap, all right.

1:05:39.968 --> 1:05:41.370
That out there was
completely inappropriate

1:05:41.403 --> 1:05:43.405
and unacceptable,
your employer and you

1:05:43.438 --> 1:05:44.706
are going to be hearing
from my attorney.

1:05:44.738 --> 1:05:46.474
There is no need
for that Chucky.

1:05:46.508 --> 1:05:48.143
Dad just don't
tell me what to do.

1:05:48.175 --> 1:05:50.077
Okay, come on,
we've got to go now.

1:05:50.110 --> 1:05:51.846
Allow me to explain
Chucky, there was...

1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:53.048
Stop it, okay?

1:05:53.081 --> 1:05:55.650
It's not Chucky, it's
never been Chucky.

1:05:55.682 --> 1:05:57.852
And that is beyond explanation.

1:05:57.885 --> 1:05:59.920
Dad, we have to leave now!

1:05:59.954 --> 1:06:00.921
I better go.

1:06:00.954 --> 1:06:02.556
Don't worry, it'll be all right.

1:06:02.590 --> 1:06:04.425
Yeah, like hell it will.

1:06:04.459 --> 1:06:07.629
Relax junior, listen,
I gotta take a pee.

1:06:07.662 --> 1:06:08.964
Something wicked.

1:06:08.997 --> 1:06:10.466
Fine, fine.

1:06:17.505 --> 1:06:20.541
Harry, you were terrific!

1:06:20.575 --> 1:06:21.643
Thanks, thanks.

1:06:21.675 --> 1:06:23.043
Did you see the show?

1:06:23.077 --> 1:06:24.079
What, no.

1:06:24.111 --> 1:06:25.880
My son doesn't like comedy.

1:06:25.914 --> 1:06:29.084
Your son, oh, I see
the resemblance.

1:06:30.017 --> 1:06:31.519
Please stop it.

1:06:32.686 --> 1:06:35.423
Give me a second with
my friend, will you?

1:06:35.456 --> 1:06:38.393
Okay fine, but I'm not
taking my eyes off you, Dad.

1:06:53.140 --> 1:06:54.075
Yeah, yeah.

1:06:58.079 --> 1:07:01.716
I just wanted to tell you how
marvelous I think your father is.

1:07:01.749 --> 1:07:03.151
Thank you, thanks very much,
I really appreciate it.

1:07:03.184 --> 1:07:05.687
No, really, really,
and lucky too.

1:07:13.528 --> 1:07:15.197
Where's Harry?

1:07:15.229 --> 1:07:16.998
His son took him.

1:07:22.604 --> 1:07:23.638
Have you ever played
slots with him?

1:07:23.671 --> 1:07:24.573
No.

1:07:24.606 --> 1:07:26.640
Oh you should, you should.

1:07:26.673 --> 1:07:27.575
What?

1:07:27.608 --> 1:07:28.610
We nearly hit the big one.

1:07:28.642 --> 1:07:29.644
Really, that's fantastic.

1:07:29.677 --> 1:07:30.711
You know the big one?

1:07:30.744 --> 1:07:32.046
No, no, I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:07:32.079 --> 1:07:33.481
Oh, right, right, right here!

1:07:33.514 --> 1:07:36.050
This is a big one
that pays $10,000.

1:07:36.084 --> 1:07:37.185
Wow $10,000, that's fantastic.

1:07:37.218 --> 1:07:39.588
Yeah, yeah, you want
to give it a try?

1:07:39.621 --> 1:07:41.088
No, I don't want to...

1:07:41.122 --> 1:07:43.158
No no no, you should try, maybe
you're lucky like your father.

1:07:43.191 --> 1:07:44.126
Oh yeah?

1:07:44.159 --> 1:07:45.626
I don't want to play
the slot machine, okay.

1:07:45.660 --> 1:07:47.496
Now what the hell
is taking so long?

1:07:47.528 --> 1:07:50.164
Let him sit in peace.

1:07:50.197 --> 1:07:52.500
You know, if it's a
number two he's doing,

1:07:52.534 --> 1:07:55.169
that can take a while,
especially at our age.

1:08:03.644 --> 1:08:05.112
Psst.

1:08:05.146 --> 1:08:07.215
Harry, what are you doing?

1:08:07.247 --> 1:08:09.851
No time to explain.

1:08:11.151 --> 1:08:14.155
This is your last chance, kid.

1:08:14.188 --> 1:08:15.724
For what?

1:08:15.756 --> 1:08:19.294
To give a dying
man his final wish.

1:08:19.326 --> 1:08:21.295
Take me to Olompali.

1:08:21.329 --> 1:08:22.863
What about your son?

1:08:22.897 --> 1:08:24.099
Chucky?

1:08:24.131 --> 1:08:26.735
I gave him the slip,
but not for long.

1:08:26.768 --> 1:08:28.303
Harry, if I were to do this,

1:08:28.335 --> 1:08:30.204
I would get in so much trouble.

1:08:30.237 --> 1:08:32.139
He would probably
have me arrested

1:08:32.173 --> 1:08:33.808
for, I don't know, kidnapping.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:36.777
Kidnapping? I'm a free man

1:08:36.811 --> 1:08:39.281
going on an outing
with a friend!

1:08:39.313 --> 1:08:41.015
That's not a crime.

1:08:41.049 --> 1:08:44.619
What about my job,
if I still have one?

1:08:44.652 --> 1:08:49.124
Oh right, would hate for
you to give up all that.

1:08:49.156 --> 1:08:52.693
Relax, I'll take the
fall, what do you say?

1:08:57.264 --> 1:09:00.102
All right, forget it

1:09:02.236 --> 1:09:03.271
Harry.

1:09:03.304 --> 1:09:04.540
What?

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:09.744
Can't make a gain unless
you take a risk, right?

1:09:09.777 --> 1:09:10.946
That's right.

1:09:10.978 --> 1:09:13.113
Well, come on then.

1:09:13.147 --> 1:09:14.182
What?

1:09:14.214 --> 1:09:16.584
We're going to Olompali.

1:09:16.617 --> 1:09:18.753
Now you're talking.

1:09:20.021 --> 1:09:21.990
Let's get out of
these silly outfits.

1:09:22.022 --> 1:09:23.223
You said it.

1:09:23.256 --> 1:09:24.925
I come from Long
Island, ever been?

1:09:24.959 --> 1:09:26.126
Yeah, East Hampton.

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:28.129
Oh, East Hampton, that's lovely.

1:09:28.161 --> 1:09:31.231
But you know, Long Island,
it's all right I guess, but oh,

1:09:31.264 --> 1:09:33.668
those winters,
they will kill you.

1:09:33.701 --> 1:09:36.338
At my age, there aren't
enough layers, you know?

1:09:36.370 --> 1:09:37.905
Just please stop talking.

1:09:37.938 --> 1:09:39.640
Okay, this is
taking way too long.

1:09:43.811 --> 1:09:44.646
Shit!

1:09:51.251 --> 1:09:52.253
Red!

1:09:52.286 --> 1:09:54.690
They took Harry!

1:09:58.860 --> 1:10:01.662
Oh, Mr.
Butler, I am so sorry.

1:10:01.696 --> 1:10:03.298
I gave
your car away.

1:10:03.330 --> 1:10:05.633
What, you gave it away?

1:10:05.666 --> 1:10:08.202
Yes, I held it for quite a
while, but when you didn't come

1:10:08.236 --> 1:10:10.338
I had to give it
to someone else.

1:10:10.370 --> 1:10:12.906
But no worries, Mr.
Byrd's son is here.

1:10:12.939 --> 1:10:14.909
I'm sure he'll give you a ride.

1:10:14.942 --> 1:10:17.613
Yes, yes, I am sure he will.

1:10:18.045 --> 1:10:19.046
Thank you.

1:10:20.947 --> 1:10:21.348
Secret plan.

1:10:21.381 --> 1:10:22.282
What's that?

1:10:22.317 --> 1:10:23.918
I'll let you know when
I come up with it.

1:10:23.951 --> 1:10:25.286
Jay, Harry, what's going on?

1:10:25.318 --> 1:10:27.354
Red, we have got to get out of
here, but we don't have a vehicle.

1:10:27.388 --> 1:10:29.024
Okay well calm
down, I'll take you.

1:10:29.057 --> 1:10:30.025
Where are you guys going?

1:10:30.058 --> 1:10:31.026
Olompali.

1:10:31.058 --> 1:10:32.192
Olompali?

1:10:32.226 --> 1:10:33.695
I stalled him as
long as I could,

1:10:33.728 --> 1:10:35.731
but he's looking for you now.

1:10:36.930 --> 1:10:37.965
Okay, you know what, let's go.

1:10:37.999 --> 1:10:39.300
Come with me.

1:10:54.048 --> 1:10:55.349
A nice house, is it yours?

1:10:55.383 --> 1:10:57.318
Yes it is, come on in.

1:10:57.351 --> 1:10:58.318
What about the other girls?

1:10:58.352 --> 1:10:59.787
Don't worry about them,
they know what to do.

1:10:59.821 --> 1:11:00.988
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

1:11:10.164 --> 1:11:11.299
Hey!

1:11:11.331 --> 1:11:12.366
Stop it!

1:11:14.802 --> 1:11:17.972
What are you doing, no! Come on!

1:11:18.004 --> 1:11:20.141
You've got to be kidding me!

1:11:21.808 --> 1:11:23.043
What the hell is this?

1:11:23.076 --> 1:11:24.311
Hey mister, can you
give us a jumpstart?

1:11:24.344 --> 1:11:25.813
- What?
- I think our battery's dead.

1:11:25.847 --> 1:11:26.648
No.

1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:28.049
We're really stuck,
give us a hand.

1:11:28.081 --> 1:11:29.349
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

1:11:29.383 --> 1:11:31.251
Say, aren't you Harry's son?

1:11:31.285 --> 1:11:32.287
What?

1:11:32.320 --> 1:11:33.287
Harry's son?

1:11:33.321 --> 1:11:34.322
I really love Harry.

1:11:34.354 --> 1:11:35.990
- Can I give you a hug?
- No!

1:11:36.022 --> 1:11:38.159
Look, I have to go, I have to,
just please don't touch me!

1:11:38.192 --> 1:11:40.361
Hey buddy, that's
not very neighborly.

1:11:40.393 --> 1:11:43.698
Now you need to apologize
to the nice ladies.

1:11:45.832 --> 1:11:46.434
Shit.

1:11:48.302 --> 1:11:51.272
Okay, okay.

1:12:04.018 --> 1:12:05.220
They're asleep.

1:12:05.253 --> 1:12:07.389
Look how sweet that is.

1:12:08.856 --> 1:12:10.525
You know, you too
can go to sleep.

1:12:10.558 --> 1:12:12.160
I got this handled.

1:12:12.192 --> 1:12:14.762
Oh, no thanks, I'm
still too wired.

1:12:18.198 --> 1:12:20.535
So what's the deal
with you and this guy?

1:12:20.567 --> 1:12:22.236
I mean, you said he
wasn't your father.

1:12:22.269 --> 1:12:25.906
No, no, no, my father
passed away recently.

1:12:25.939 --> 1:12:26.840
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1:12:26.874 --> 1:12:29.043
Oh don't be, what I mean to say

1:12:29.076 --> 1:12:31.212
is we weren't that close.

1:12:31.245 --> 1:12:33.348
You know that happens.

1:12:33.380 --> 1:12:37.451
Yeah, anyway I'm taking
Harry to his new home,

1:12:37.485 --> 1:12:39.019
the one he doesn't
want to go to.

1:12:39.053 --> 1:12:41.156
Yeah that must be kind of hard.

1:12:41.188 --> 1:12:44.793
He's just desperate to get
to this place Olompali.

1:12:44.826 --> 1:12:46.227
Why?

1:12:46.259 --> 1:12:47.961
I'm not exactly sure.

1:12:47.995 --> 1:12:51.131
Good times, a last
flame, I don't know.

1:12:51.165 --> 1:12:56.171
Well it is very beautiful, I
haven't been there in years.

1:12:56.204 --> 1:12:57.371
Never been.

1:12:57.405 --> 1:13:00.441
So what do you do when you...

1:13:00.473 --> 1:13:01.275
In real life?

1:13:03.344 --> 1:13:05.847
Well, I'm an accountant, honey.

1:13:05.879 --> 1:13:06.480
You're kidding.

1:13:06.513 --> 1:13:08.048
For real.

1:13:08.081 --> 1:13:11.186
What you thinking,
wild burlesque dancer

1:13:11.219 --> 1:13:13.421
can't hold down a
straight day job?

1:13:13.454 --> 1:13:15.055
I didn't think a
straight day job holder

1:13:15.089 --> 1:13:17.959
could be a wild crazy
burlesque dancer.

1:13:18.625 --> 1:13:20.327
It's a wild world, baby!

1:13:20.361 --> 1:13:21.863
I guess it is.

1:13:26.233 --> 1:13:29.504
You know, I really
want to thank you.

1:13:29.536 --> 1:13:31.271
You saved our ass back there.

1:13:31.304 --> 1:13:34.174
Oh, Red, that's
sweet, but no problem.

1:13:34.207 --> 1:13:38.280
Actually, I have to
say, you saved mine.

1:14:34.335 --> 1:14:39.341
Wow, whoa, this-this
is really something!

1:14:40.473 --> 1:14:41.508
Harry!

1:14:41.541 --> 1:14:43.678
What'd I tell you?

1:14:43.710 --> 1:14:46.046
Harry, are you okay?

1:14:46.080 --> 1:14:47.314
Never better.

1:14:47.348 --> 1:14:49.384
Hey, where are you going?

1:14:49.416 --> 1:14:52.987
Hey, he's off, I've got
to keep an eye on him.

1:14:53.687 --> 1:14:55.088
Have you been here?

1:14:55.121 --> 1:14:58.125
Yeah, long time
ago. So beautiful.

1:15:11.405 --> 1:15:13.340
Hey, Harry!

1:15:16.076 --> 1:15:19.046
Harry, hey, hey, hey!

1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:21.448
What's the damn
hurry there, partner?

1:15:21.482 --> 1:15:22.384
The Outlook.

1:15:23.483 --> 1:15:25.320
What's next, Everest?

1:15:25.353 --> 1:15:26.654
Come on.

1:15:26.687 --> 1:15:28.356
Oh, for God's sake,
Harry, slow down.

1:15:40.300 --> 1:15:43.303
Harriet and I used to
hike down to that beach.

1:15:43.336 --> 1:15:45.307
What are you, part
mountain goat?

1:15:47.441 --> 1:15:48.309
That's nothing.

1:15:49.244 --> 1:15:52.313
We hung out with the
seals and sea lions.

1:15:52.345 --> 1:15:56.049
Saw a dolphin, even
some whales up there.

1:15:56.082 --> 1:15:57.617
Harry, that's good times.

1:15:57.651 --> 1:15:58.586
The best.

1:16:06.527 --> 1:16:07.996
Harry?
Yeah?

1:16:09.429 --> 1:16:12.066
You remember when you said
your father was an SOB?

1:16:13.666 --> 1:16:14.568
Yeah.

1:16:14.602 --> 1:16:18.272
My father, he was an SOB too.

1:16:18.304 --> 1:16:19.272
I know that.

1:16:19.305 --> 1:16:21.075
You do?

1:16:21.107 --> 1:16:23.244
Yeah, I can tell
by the way you are.

1:16:24.378 --> 1:16:26.680
You remind me of myself
when I was your age.

1:16:26.714 --> 1:16:27.648
How's that?

1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:31.052
Beaten down, unsure of things.

1:16:31.085 --> 1:16:32.687
But bursting with life.

1:16:34.054 --> 1:16:36.523
You see those trips
here with Harriet,

1:16:36.557 --> 1:16:38.226
that's what kept me going.

1:16:39.192 --> 1:16:41.262
Just like acting
keeps you going.

1:16:42.830 --> 1:16:45.166
If I were you, I'd be
pissed at my old man.

1:16:45.198 --> 1:16:47.535
You have a right to be,
he wasn't there for you.

1:16:47.567 --> 1:16:49.102
And I'll tell you
something else.

1:16:49.135 --> 1:16:51.539
Only by getting pissed
can you forgive him.

1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:54.242
I don't understand.

1:16:54.275 --> 1:16:55.677
What was your father's name?

1:16:57.143 --> 1:16:58.545
Grit.

1:16:58.579 --> 1:17:01.715
We all have a good and bad side.

1:17:01.749 --> 1:17:04.419
Me, you, even Grit.

1:17:06.086 --> 1:17:09.389
We get to choose, Grit just
didn't know he could choose.

1:17:09.423 --> 1:17:12.227
That was tough on you,
but worse for him.

1:17:14.862 --> 1:17:16.264
I guess so.

1:17:16.296 --> 1:17:17.398
I know so.

1:17:18.365 --> 1:17:20.501
Anyway, you still have time.

1:17:20.534 --> 1:17:21.736
For what?

1:17:21.768 --> 1:17:24.671
To be proud of who you
are and what you do.

1:17:25.872 --> 1:17:29.343
No matter what the
result, just live.

1:17:29.375 --> 1:17:33.814
Okay, okay, thanks Harry,
thanks, thanks a lot.

1:17:35.381 --> 1:17:40.120
Ah, today's a good day to die.

1:17:41.287 --> 1:17:42.424
Just kidding.

1:17:45.159 --> 1:17:47.195
I came into this world crying

1:17:47.228 --> 1:17:49.330
and I'll go out laughing.

1:17:49.362 --> 1:17:51.365
Look, right
there, there they are.

1:17:51.397 --> 1:17:54.302
Uh-oh, party's over.

1:18:01.142 --> 1:18:02.876
That's him officer, that's
the guy right there.

1:18:02.910 --> 1:18:03.577
Come on, Dad.

1:18:03.611 --> 1:18:04.612
What seems to be the problem?

1:18:04.644 --> 1:18:05.812
Are you kidding me?

1:18:05.845 --> 1:18:07.482
You kidnapped my father, I'm
filing charges against you.

1:18:07.514 --> 1:18:09.383
I wasn't kidnapped.

1:18:09.415 --> 1:18:11.218
That's right officer,
Harry wanted to come here.

1:18:11.251 --> 1:18:12.786
You tell him, girl.

1:18:12.820 --> 1:18:14.354
Okay, but if you
file a complaint

1:18:14.388 --> 1:18:15.590
I'll have to write a report.

1:18:15.622 --> 1:18:20.527
Let him go or I'm not moving.

1:18:20.561 --> 1:18:21.461
Now, Dad.

1:18:21.495 --> 1:18:24.564
Don't now Dad me, Charles.

1:18:24.598 --> 1:18:26.234
I know deep down you mean well,

1:18:26.267 --> 1:18:28.436
but no harm was done.

1:18:28.469 --> 1:18:32.439
In fact, I had the
time of my life.

1:18:39.812 --> 1:18:42.182
All right. Okay fine,
forget about it.

1:18:42.215 --> 1:18:43.517
Please, Dad.

1:18:55.396 --> 1:18:57.331
You stay away from my father.

1:19:00.934 --> 1:19:03.271
Bye, Harry.

1:19:03.304 --> 1:19:07.642
So long Jay. You take care.

1:19:09.777 --> 1:19:10.612
I will.

1:20:18.778 --> 1:20:21.415
Damn. Damn.

1:20:22.415 --> 1:20:24.384
I guess it was worse
for you than anyone.

1:20:26.053 --> 1:20:28.488
I know now, I know.

1:20:40.601 --> 1:20:41.568
Goodbye, Dad.

1:20:45.438 --> 1:20:46.340
I love you.

1:20:59.018 --> 1:21:01.421
I heard Harry
got used to the Golden Oaks.

1:21:01.455 --> 1:21:02.923
He even liked it.

1:21:02.955 --> 1:21:05.726
When the time came,
his passing was easy.

1:21:28.348 --> 1:21:30.418
A few weeks after Harry died,

1:21:30.451 --> 1:21:34.421
I got a call from his lawyer,
George, same as my father's.

1:21:34.455 --> 1:21:36.424
He wouldn't tell me
what it was about.

1:21:36.456 --> 1:21:38.425
He said we had to meet.

1:21:42.763 --> 1:21:45.433
Jay, nice to see you,
thank you for coming.

1:21:45.465 --> 1:21:46.300
Have a seat.

1:21:50.137 --> 1:21:53.073
I know this is a bit awkward
so I'll get right to it.

1:21:54.540 --> 1:21:57.677
Some time ago, I received
a recording from Harry.

1:21:57.710 --> 1:22:00.548
He wanted me to play it for
you all after he was gone.

1:22:01.749 --> 1:22:05.620
So. Here it is.

1:22:09.455 --> 1:22:13.627
Hello. I hope this
damn thing works.

1:22:16.162 --> 1:22:18.398
Well, I bet you
thought you'd seen

1:22:18.432 --> 1:22:21.836
the last of me, guess again.

1:22:21.869 --> 1:22:23.470
You don't get off that easy.

1:22:24.437 --> 1:22:27.741
By the time you see
this, I'll be long gone,

1:22:27.775 --> 1:22:29.376
but that's okay.

1:22:29.410 --> 1:22:31.813
Don't cry for me, Argentina,
I'm in a better place.

1:22:33.479 --> 1:22:37.485
Anyways, you kids know I've
divided my considerable estate

1:22:37.518 --> 1:22:42.423
between the three of you. Manage
it wisely and for God sake,

1:22:42.455 --> 1:22:44.458
have some fun with the money.

1:22:46.125 --> 1:22:48.829
I know maybe I wasn't
the best of fathers.

1:22:48.862 --> 1:22:52.166
You are but I was a damn
sight better than my old man

1:22:52.198 --> 1:22:54.468
and did my best.

1:22:54.500 --> 1:22:57.604
Know that I loved you,
and no hard feelings

1:22:57.638 --> 1:23:01.042
about sending me off to the
old folks home at the end.

1:23:02.675 --> 1:23:05.412
Now I wanted my
friend Jay to be here

1:23:05.446 --> 1:23:09.049
because there's one property
I wanted him to have,

1:23:09.081 --> 1:23:10.985
the old Magnolia Theater.

1:23:11.018 --> 1:23:12.953
Don't get excited,
it ain't much,

1:23:12.986 --> 1:23:15.089
you kids won't miss it a bit.

1:23:16.557 --> 1:23:19.193
I just saw Jay might enjoy
it and put it to good use,

1:23:19.226 --> 1:23:22.662
maybe put on a comedy show
now and then, who knows.

1:23:23.830 --> 1:23:27.867
Okay, well
that's about it.

1:23:27.901 --> 1:23:31.505
Take care and see you around.

1:23:33.573 --> 1:23:34.776
Dad really liked you.

1:23:46.186 --> 1:23:49.490
Okay, watch your
step folks, please.

1:23:49.522 --> 1:23:53.126
And if you want to remember
me in your wills, Jay Butler.

1:23:54.193 --> 1:23:56.162
You're so funny.

1:23:56.196 --> 1:23:58.198
What, you think I'm joking?

1:24:00.500 --> 1:24:03.204
I kept my job and
started doing acting on the side.

1:24:05.539 --> 1:24:06.907
I even got the kids involved.

1:24:06.939 --> 1:24:08.875
Since the property
was free and clear,

1:24:08.909 --> 1:24:10.777
I was able to borrow against it.

1:24:10.811 --> 1:24:13.714
That and a settlement I
got from my father's estate

1:24:13.746 --> 1:24:16.683
was more than enough for Danny's
college fund, Chloe's too.

1:24:19.286 --> 1:24:21.489
Danny surprised
the hell out of me

1:24:21.522 --> 1:24:24.492
when he told me he
wanted to study acting.

1:24:37.271 --> 1:24:39.639
Even Susan and I made our peace.

1:24:49.316 --> 1:24:52.086
So that pretty much
brings you up to date.

1:24:52.119 --> 1:24:54.889
Now you may not think my
life story is exactly comedy,

1:24:54.921 --> 1:24:59.927
but let me tell you, it's
the real stuff that's funny.

1:25:01.161 --> 1:25:03.297
That matters, but
let's be honest.

1:25:03.330 --> 1:25:05.265
I know you didn't come
here just to see me.

1:25:05.299 --> 1:25:10.170
So, without further ado, the
Harry Byrd Memorial Theater

1:25:10.202 --> 1:25:13.072
proudly presents
the one, the only,

1:25:13.106 --> 1:25:17.111
Miss Pussy Gato and
the Kittenettes!

1:25:17.143 --> 1:25:20.947
Say hello to Miss Nurse Nice!

1:25:22.214 --> 1:25:24.985
Hey there, Tight Pants.

1:25:25.018 --> 1:25:28.088
Anybody want to party?

1:25:36.830 --> 1:25:39.767
That's my nephew.

1:25:52.045 --> 1:25:54.214
You go Red, I mean Nurse Nice!
