<i> [bleep]</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:40.672
[zeke] somebody

We're done.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.848
[shawn] go tell joe.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.050
[kris] we got a real problem.

00:51.052 --> 00:52.651
All right, guys,
it's not going to work.

01:34.028 --> 01:36.061
[vernon] we've got to take
advantage of every minute.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.297
Some of the guys are hungry.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.431
They want gold.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.300
I want gold.

01:42.269 --> 01:43.502
The gold's down there.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.339
Can't get it
if we're up here.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.208
<i> [narrator] as the second major</i>
<i>  blizzard of the season</i>

01:51.245 --> 01:52.377
[gary] a lot of snow.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.379
A lot of snow,

01:54.381 --> 01:57.649
but you got to shovel
and move on.

01:59.086 --> 02:00.385
<i> [narrator] vernon adkison</i>

02:00.387 --> 02:03.422
<i>  is digging out</i>
<i>  and doubling down on divers.</i>

02:03.924 --> 02:05.157
What we'll do is

02:05.159 --> 02:08.127
we'll get mikel suited up.

02:08.129 --> 02:10.362
That will be his
first dive with us.

02:11.065 --> 02:12.231
Let's see how he does.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.167
Fifty-six
is absolutely loaded,

02:15.169 --> 02:18.103
so I'm shooting
for 200 ounces this season.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.005
That'd be a personal record.

02:20.007 --> 02:23.342
But these damn blizzards
just keep knocking us off
the ice.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.043
That's why I'm going
to expand my team

02:25.045 --> 02:28.080
and get more hours on
the box to when we can.

02:28.082 --> 02:31.116
So today we're breaking
in a new diver, mikel.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.152
He's supposedly a real pro.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.454
Hopefully,
he'll hit the ground running.

02:38.159 --> 02:41.193
<i> [mikel] I'm a career diver.</i>
<i>  I've been diving since '85.</i>

02:41.195 --> 02:45.330
North slope, prudhoe bay,
blank islands.
Worked the cook inlet.

02:45.332 --> 02:49.067
Some of the most furious
current in the world.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.938
Very challenging
work in alaska.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.377
[mikel speaking]

03:15.296 --> 03:16.995
[gary] all right,
he's at the bottom.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.131
He's on the bottom.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.533
How's your hot water?

03:22.069 --> 03:23.135
<i> [mikel] uh...</i>

03:23.971 --> 03:26.438
[mikel speaking]

03:31.345 --> 03:33.645
you're not getting
any hot water?

03:33.647 --> 03:36.048
[mikel speaking]

03:43.457 --> 03:46.124
all right.
Okay, gary, he's coming up.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.263
[gary speaking]

03:51.498 --> 03:52.431
[vernon speaking]

03:52.433 --> 03:53.465
[gary speaking]

03:53.467 --> 03:54.499
[mikel speaking]

04:07.715 --> 04:10.148
what's going on?
You warming up?

04:10.150 --> 04:13.352
There's not enough
flow on the hot water.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.820
Hot water's the right
temperature,

04:14.822 --> 04:16.989
but if it can't get it
to your peripheral

04:18.125 --> 04:21.159
it's just passing the hose
from your feet to your hands.

04:22.129 --> 04:26.164
We're making some
adjustments to the system

04:26.166 --> 04:29.201
so that we can get
more flow down to him

04:29.203 --> 04:32.137
so that it goes
to all the body parts.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.806
[gary speaking]

04:34.808 --> 04:36.975
[mikel and gary speaking]

04:38.412 --> 04:39.278
[vernon] mikel
was complaining

04:39.280 --> 04:41.446
that he wasn't getting
enough hot water.

04:41.448 --> 04:44.082
That's the same flow that
the other divers were getting.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.184
But divers can be finicky.

04:46.186 --> 04:49.388
We dialed that up,
so the issue should be
behind us

04:49.390 --> 04:51.256
and we should
be back to getting gold.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.239
[mikel speaking]

05:09.476 --> 05:11.343
I think I heard him
say "payday."

05:15.916 --> 05:18.283
[mikel speaking]

05:30.230 --> 05:31.630
[bleep] damn it.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.436
So what about the hot water?

05:40.107 --> 05:43.108
[mikel speaking]

05:43.677 --> 05:46.244
[bleep] been down
there one minute

05:46.246 --> 05:48.480
and he's complaining
about the hot water again.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.151
Mikel said
there was a problem.

05:53.153 --> 05:55.387
Well, if there was,
it's fixed.

05:55.389 --> 05:58.290
<i>  I mean, he knows</i>
<i>  this is not the bahamas.</i>

05:58.292 --> 06:01.293
He's an ice diver.
Of course it's cold.

06:01.295 --> 06:03.295
<i>  We're maxed out on hot water.</i>

06:03.297 --> 06:07.032
If this is not enough for him,
well, sorry, charlie.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.800
<i>  We're wasting time here.</i>

06:08.802 --> 06:10.802
And if I'm going
to make that 200 ounces,

06:10.804 --> 06:12.270
I've got to have producers.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.042
He's got to warm his hands,
warm his feet.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.644
That's time away
from dredging.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.280
If he spends a third
of his time doing that,

06:22.282 --> 06:24.683
that's a third
less gold we'll get.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.457
<i> [narrator] ten miles west...</i>

06:36.063 --> 06:38.096
[shawn] hopefully
this is the hole.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.865
We'll keep looking for it,
we'll find it,

06:39.867 --> 06:42.634
we'll get on it eventually.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.171
[narrator]
<i>  to make the payments on</i>
<i>  his rapidly expanding empire,</i>

06:46.173 --> 06:49.508
<i>  shawn pomrenke is on</i>
<i> the trail of a golden jackpot.</i>

06:50.310 --> 06:52.444
Let's get set up
and run it.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.148
If I want to make all
my payments this season,

06:56.150 --> 06:58.150
I still need
about 100 ounces,

06:58.152 --> 07:00.652
so I'm looking
for a big payout.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.788
And I think
I finally found one.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.657
<i>  I've drilled holes all over</i>
<i>  this ancient riverbed</i>

07:05.659 --> 07:08.026
<i>  and from the material</i>
<i>  I've been seeing,</i>

07:08.028 --> 07:10.128
I'm confident there's a giant
honey hole here

07:10.130 --> 07:11.430
just waiting to be tapped.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.064
So I'm going
to double up my efforts

07:13.066 --> 07:14.366
and I'm going to find it.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.668
I'm gonna get the hot water
heater fired up

07:16.670 --> 07:18.270
and we'll get
everything running

07:18.272 --> 07:21.339
and get you suited up
and get down there.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.141
Today, I'm going to dive

07:23.143 --> 07:26.278
along with my second
in command, joe fullwood.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.914
<i>  The guy's aces.</i>
<i>  Best diver in nome.</i>

07:28.916 --> 07:30.949
Well, second best.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.285
<i>  And the sluice box</i>
<i>  should reflect that.</i>

07:33.287 --> 07:36.288
Between joe and I that gold
doesn't stand a chance.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.560
Just getting the hot water
dialed in for joe.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.130
126 right now.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.065
Enough to keep him
nice and toasty.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.535
We got water running
in the sluice box.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.139
Oh, come on.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.546
Really?

08:03.183 --> 08:05.317
[generator starts running]

08:05.319 --> 08:07.953
20 below out
and nothing wants to work.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.257
Cold weather can really
test the equipment,

08:12.259 --> 08:15.861
but it's my responsibility
as tender to keep joe alive.

08:15.863 --> 08:19.164
<i>  The tender is the diver's</i>
<i>  first line of defense.</i>

08:19.166 --> 08:22.634
In ice mining,
there's just as many things
that can go wrong topside

08:22.636 --> 08:24.069
as there is on the bottom.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.000
Well, I just laid
a towel over it,

10:35.002 --> 10:37.168
block off part of the intake,

10:38.171 --> 10:41.339
and put the hot air around
the carb and everything.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.508
Seems to be doing okay now.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.981
Joe is no rookie.
He knows how to gauge risk.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.651
<i>  Air compressor's not</i>
<i>  working the best</i>
<i>  in these temperatures,</i>

10:52.653 --> 10:54.919
but if he wants to keep
looking for gold,

I'll let him.

<i>  I'm going to keep my eye</i>
<i>  on that air compressor.</i>

<i> [joe] I just feel grateful</i>
<i>  every second it's running.</i>

12:01.922 --> 12:05.090
That's what you look for
if you're an inlet miner
or a prospector.

12:05.092 --> 12:06.725
You look for veins of quartz,

12:06.727 --> 12:11.262
a lot of times there's
gold embedded in it.

<i>  and then I'll climb it.</i>

13:01.014 --> 13:01.880

14:14.921 --> 14:17.188
<i>  it's probably better he find</i>
<i>  another rig to dredge on,</i>

14:17.190 --> 14:20.658
because right now
we've got to produce.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.261
<i>  There are a million things</i>
<i>  that can go wrong out here</i>

14:23.263 --> 14:27.065
and today it was the human
element that failed us.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.200
[mikel speaking]

14:30.670 --> 14:32.470
<i> [vernon] we got</i>
<i>  to find another diver.</i>

14:35.408 --> 14:37.475
[narrator]
<i>  while vernon's forced</i>
<i>  to pack it in,</i>

14:43.516 --> 14:44.616
<i>  11 miles west...</i>

14:48.955 --> 14:50.421
Joe's air supply...

14:50.824 --> 14:52.957
Right now she's dying,

14:52.959 --> 14:55.693
but he's on good gold
so he doesn't want to come up

14:55.695 --> 14:58.363
so I guess I got to babysit
this piece of [bleep].

15:00.133 --> 15:03.268
<i> [narrator] mr. Gold's holding</i>
<i>  out for a double dive day,</i>

15:03.270 --> 15:05.670
<i>  but with a fading</i>
<i>  air compressor,</i>

15:05.672 --> 15:08.039
<i>  his plan may be</i>
<i>  on its last breath.</i>

15:09.476 --> 15:11.943
Plan was to double up
the hours on the box today,

15:11.945 --> 15:13.945
looking for that sweet spot.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.047
<i>  But with the air</i>
<i>  compressor on the fritz,</i>

15:16.049 --> 15:18.116
I'm not even sure we're going
to get one full dive in,

15:18.118 --> 15:19.984
let alone two.

15:19.986 --> 15:21.586
<i> [joe] yeah, man,</i>
<i>  I'm seeing good gold.</i>

15:29.496 --> 15:31.396
He's seeing good gold

15:31.398 --> 15:34.666
and he's still
breathing, so...

15:34.668 --> 15:36.901
Hell, we're going
to keep on mining.

15:36.903 --> 15:40.872
No gold, no paycheck,
so we have to make it.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.508
And we just keep
limping it along.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.582
[joe speaking]

15:52.385 --> 15:54.585
[generator revving]

15:56.423 --> 15:59.257

[bleep] thing.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.224
[joe] yeah. Yeah.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.793
No, there's not much diving
to be done with air like that.

17:08.795 --> 17:09.961
No.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.798
<i>  Today didn't go</i>
<i>  according to plan at all.</i>

17:13.800 --> 17:16.200
The whole tag team dive
thing didn't even happen.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.202
I didn't even get
a chance to dive.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.505
<i>  I'm pretty bummed the air</i>
<i>  compressor crapped out,</i>

17:20.507 --> 17:24.075
<i> but I'm glad that joe got some</i>
<i>  decent hours on some gold.</i>

17:24.077 --> 17:26.310
Sometimes you just got
to look at the silver lining.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.012
One good dive from joe

17:28.014 --> 17:31.015
is like having 20 good
dives with the kellys.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.018
[joe speaking]

17:34.020 --> 17:36.387

definitely see some color.

[shawn speaking]

17:55.041 --> 17:58.643
<i> [narrator] half the fleet's</i>
<i>  already felt the sting</i>
<i>  of breakdowns</i>

17:58.645 --> 18:00.311
<i>  as dives have been cut short.</i>

18:02.015 --> 18:04.182
<i>  But as clouds roll in,</i>

18:05.852 --> 18:08.553
<i>  the others are just</i>

18:15.295 --> 18:17.095
[kris] team meeting everybody!

18:17.864 --> 18:20.298
Plan today is get gold.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.101
Okay, let's get the high
pressure lines locked on.

18:23.103 --> 18:24.569
Let's get the hose
in the water,

18:24.571 --> 18:26.003
let's get
the jet log in the water.

18:26.005 --> 18:30.174
I need that hot water
system rocking and rolling.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.810
<i> [narrator] after a long</i>
<i>  and stress-filled</i>
<i>  start to the season...</i>

18:32.812 --> 18:34.846
Y'all,
let's just do this today.

18:34.848 --> 18:38.983
<i> [narrator] ...Captain</i>
<i>  kris kelly is finally ready</i>
<i>  to go under the ice.</i>

18:38.985 --> 18:41.119
We're going to make
all of this come together,

18:41.121 --> 18:43.521
and we're going to make some
[bleep] gold on top of it.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.357
We're like that close.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.193
After our crap summer,

18:49.195 --> 18:51.295
I went big to try
to save everything.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.431
<i>  I got a top</i>
<i>  of the line operation.</i>

18:53.433 --> 18:56.300
<i>  Eight inch nozzle,</i>
<i>  new sluice box, new engines.</i>

18:56.302 --> 18:58.636
I've got brand-new everything.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.671
There's no way
I can't succeed.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.274
<i>  But I racked up</i>
<i>  so much debt doing it,</i>

19:03.276 --> 19:05.209
I need at least 25 ounces

19:05.211 --> 19:06.577
to make it through
this season.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.180
Go ahead, connect it.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.886
[kris] come on [bleep].
Daddy loves you.

19:14.888 --> 19:17.088
The problem is
this season's been a disaster.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.222
<i>  It took days</i>

19:18.224 --> 19:20.791
<i>  just to get on the ice</i>
<i>  and get everything set up.</i>

19:20.793 --> 19:22.126
<i>  So we're already behind.</i>

19:22.128 --> 19:24.128
<i>  But the good news is</i>
<i>  we are ready.</i>

19:24.130 --> 19:26.931
So I'm pumped just to get
down there and get some gold.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.066
I know this dive
is going to be amazing.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.301
Everything's fine.

19:30.303 --> 19:32.970
We've got our hose connected,
high-pressure line connected,

19:32.972 --> 19:36.207
the hot water is running,
I'm gonna auger
my pump-down holes.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.575
And we're
going to put kris down.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.144
[drill whirring]

19:47.120 --> 19:49.053
[kris speaking]

19:56.996 --> 19:59.697
26 feet, dude.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.568
We broke off too much
of our [bleep] hose
in the move.

20:05.205 --> 20:08.973
So right now, we could have
a little itty bitty problem.

20:08.975 --> 20:12.109
<i>  We had a brand new</i>
<i>  nice long hose to go</i>
<i>  diving with this year.</i>

20:12.111 --> 20:14.045
Emphasis on "had."

20:14.047 --> 20:17.014
<i>  my dad broke off a huge</i>
<i>  chunk of our suction hose</i>

20:17.016 --> 20:18.549
when we were hauling
our gear on the ice.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.252
[kris speaking]

20:22.322 --> 20:23.988
[andy speaking]

20:25.658 --> 20:27.491
it's not gonna...
Our dive's not gonna work.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.962
Like four feet of [bleep]
working underneath the water?

20:35.969 --> 20:38.236
<i>  So all the good gold is deep,</i>

20:38.238 --> 20:40.271
<i>  and we're gonna have no hose</i>

20:40.273 --> 20:42.974
<i>  at the bottom</i>
<i> of the ocean to get gold with.</i>

20:42.976 --> 20:45.910
I'm basically stuck
with whatever I land on.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.212
So right now I have
to pray we land on gold.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.580
Fingers crossed.

20:53.953 --> 20:55.386
First dive of the season,

20:55.388 --> 20:57.288
we're ready to rock and roll.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.090
It's my chance
to go make the gold

20:59.092 --> 21:01.926
and see what
we're standing on right now,

21:01.928 --> 21:04.962
and I hope to god I can
actually make some gold today.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.523
<i>  My new nozzle looks awesome</i>
<i>  underneath the water!</i>

21:36.162 --> 21:37.862
[brad] tell us when
<i> you want to us to idle</i>
<i>  up.</i>

21:37.864 --> 21:39.063
<i> [kris] okay.</i>

21:40.967 --> 21:42.833
It's our first dive
of the year.

21:42.835 --> 21:44.435
Kris is down under the water.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.238
<i> [kris] okay, idle up.</i>

21:48.908 --> 21:50.975
[brad]
<i>  okay, we're idling up.</i>
<i>  Be careful.</i>

21:58.418 --> 21:59.350
<i>  Breathing okay, kris?</i>

21:59.352 --> 22:01.118
[kris speaking]

22:03.022 --> 22:04.855
<i>  it's a little bit of sand.</i>

22:04.857 --> 22:06.590
<i> [brad] hopefully</i>
<i>  the sand's not too deep.</i>

22:08.161 --> 22:11.095
Bottom's here and our nozzle's
like right here.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.366

22:19.972 --> 22:21.605
<i> [brad] put us</i>
<i>  on some gold now.</i>

22:22.342 --> 22:24.942
<i> [kris] right now</i>
<i>  I'm clearing off the sand</i>

22:24.944 --> 22:27.611
<i>  so I can hopefully</i>
<i>  see what's in the cobble.</i>

22:33.486 --> 22:35.519
<i> [brad] so what's the bottom</i>
<i>  looking like down there?</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:40.458
[kris speaking]

22:44.030 --> 22:45.429
<i>  sand for miles.</i>

22:46.399 --> 22:47.965
<i>  We got a real problem.</i>

22:49.769 --> 22:52.036
<i>  We don't have</i>
<i>  a long enough hose</i>

22:52.038 --> 22:54.105
<i>  and we're on a sand bed</i>
<i>  from hell.</i>

22:54.107 --> 22:55.606

23:00.646 --> 23:02.012
<i> [narrator] eight miles east...</i>

<i> [zeke] looks like</i>
<i>  steve's showing up,</i>

23:13.259 --> 23:15.960
<i>  and that'll be good,</i>
<i>  because he's going to have</i>

23:15.962 --> 23:17.762
a long dive day today.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.163
We just hit daylight saving,

23:19.165 --> 23:20.598
so the day
just got a lot longer.

23:21.667 --> 23:22.767
<i> [narrator] for zeke tenhoff,</i>

23:22.769 --> 23:25.569
<i>  it's quickly getting</i>
<i>  to be do or die time.</i>

23:27.006 --> 23:30.374
<i> [zeke] last week</i>
<i>  was one of the hardest</i>
<i>  weeks I've ever...</i>

23:30.376 --> 23:32.810
Yeah, I just got
my ass kicked last week.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.378
In every sense of the word.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.115
<i>  This winter is not starting</i>
<i>  out very well for me.</i>

23:38.117 --> 23:40.785
I've had two dives,
both of them were cut short

23:40.787 --> 23:43.621
and we still
don't have any gold.

23:43.623 --> 23:46.223
<i>  I need seven or eight ounces</i>
<i>  just to keep going at all.</i>

23:46.225 --> 23:48.392
<i>  And right now,</i>
<i>  that's looking pretty grim.</i>

23:48.394 --> 23:50.094
Got to be honest with myself,

23:50.096 --> 23:52.029
if I can't keep it
going this winter,

23:52.031 --> 23:54.532
I might just have to move on
and do something else.

23:56.068 --> 23:57.668
<i>  We could get gold here.</i>

23:57.670 --> 24:00.504
Best case scenario
is that today

24:00.506 --> 24:03.841
I have evidence that the gold
is going to be followable.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.075
And there's a lot more of it.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.949
All right. Fired up.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.653
[zeke speaking]

24:20.960 --> 24:22.626
getting it in the box,
that's the hard part.

24:24.363 --> 24:25.930
<i> [zeke] we're way behind</i>
<i>  this winter,</i>

24:25.932 --> 24:27.898
we need all the aspects
of this operation

24:27.900 --> 24:29.266
to start firing
on all cylinders

24:29.268 --> 24:30.668
to be able to catch up.

24:30.670 --> 24:31.735
For the rest of this season

24:31.737 --> 24:33.370
there is not very
much margin for error,

24:33.372 --> 24:37.107
like everything needs to go
a lot more right than it has.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.020
<i>  All right, I'm heading down.</i>

24:52.825 --> 24:54.258
<i>  Water's nice and clear.</i>

24:56.896 --> 24:58.262
<i>  Beautiful down here.</i>

25:08.107 --> 25:10.140
[gabe] all right.
We got him in the water.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.509
He's down. We're mining.

25:14.213 --> 25:15.279

25:50.650 --> 25:52.249
[gabe] [bleep] damn it.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.552
Okay, this won't do. [bleep]

25:56.289 --> 25:58.155
<i>  tailings hole</i>
<i>  isn't big enough,</i>

25:58.157 --> 26:01.025
<i>  and it's spilling that murky</i>
<i>  water down into his dive hole</i>

26:01.027 --> 26:02.626
and clouding him out.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.365
[zeke speaking]

-yo, zeke.
<i> -[zeke] what's up?</i>

[gabe speaking]

26:22.248 --> 26:23.447
[zeke speaking]

26:24.517 --> 26:26.150
just give us,
like, five minutes.

26:26.152 --> 26:28.152
<i> [zeke] okay.</i>

26:34.126 --> 26:36.527
[gabe] just might be good
to just have a bigger
opening, you know?

26:37.330 --> 26:39.430
[drill whirring]

26:51.243 --> 26:52.509
[gabe speaking]

26:54.380 --> 26:57.948
as you can see,
even though I was trying to

26:57.950 --> 27:01.752
get enough drainage
out of the sluice box,

27:01.754 --> 27:04.121
all the ice is so low
that the water level

27:04.123 --> 27:06.857
wants to sit above
where the hole is.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.360
It's kind of doing it
at his dive hole.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.929
But we're spilling right here
so we're punching holes.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.131
You can see we're
draining right here.

27:14.934 --> 27:17.101
But as we're trying
to remedy that,

27:17.103 --> 27:18.602
everything's backed up

27:19.071 --> 27:20.104
through this

27:20.239 --> 27:23.374
all the way around
the backside to the generator.

27:31.984 --> 27:34.018
[generator stops running]

27:35.054 --> 27:36.153
no!

27:36.355 --> 27:37.588
Tell him to come up!

27:39.291 --> 27:41.058
Get him up,
get him up right now.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.260
Yeah, come up right now,
please come up.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.408
[gabe] he's coming up.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.066
[gabe] it stopped
for a second.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.100
Dealing with
the tailings hole,

28:23.102 --> 28:24.735
we flooded the whole area,

28:24.737 --> 28:27.237
and it kicked off his air
compressor and everything.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.108
We have to address this issue
before we can keep mining.

28:35.815 --> 28:36.847
[zeke speaking]

28:38.350 --> 28:40.984
like, he's the one that
came upon it, I didn't.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.700
This is unbelievable.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.402
I was hoping
for a comeback today,

28:58.404 --> 29:01.338
but instead we just fried
our brand new generator

29:01.340 --> 29:03.207
in a big puddle
of salt water.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.413
Yeah.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.284
We have no gold, none.

29:14.286 --> 29:17.321
And it feels like
everything is falling apart.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.256
It's like,
how can I trust you guys

29:19.258 --> 29:21.091
to keep an eye
on what's going on

29:21.093 --> 29:23.994
if you've overlooked
something this basic?

29:26.098 --> 29:27.865
Somebody should have noticed

29:27.867 --> 29:29.633
that the [bleep] generators
were in a puddle.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.402
<i>  Like, seriously.</i>

29:32.404 --> 29:35.038
I think that's like the only
thing that's actually
really important.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.652
First dive of the year, kris,
put us on some gold now.

29:50.623 --> 29:51.655
[kris speaking]

29:59.999 --> 30:01.331
<i>  I hate sand.</i>

30:03.302 --> 30:05.936
<i> [narrator] so far,</i>
<i>  kris kelly is hosed,</i>

30:05.938 --> 30:08.405
<i>  coming up short on his</i>
<i>  first dive of the season.</i>

30:10.109 --> 30:11.842
He doesn't have
a long enough hose,

30:11.844 --> 30:14.645
hot water is good,
the suction's good,

30:14.647 --> 30:16.380
<i>  but we're on sand,</i>
<i>  that's the problem right now.</i>

30:17.016 --> 30:18.148
[kris speaking]

30:18.384 --> 30:19.249
the truth is...

30:19.251 --> 30:20.484
[kris speaking]

30:46.946 --> 30:48.645
hey, but everything's
working great.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.113
That's all that matters.

30:50.482 --> 30:51.548
[kris speaking]

31:12.304 --> 31:13.670
<i> [kris] ahh!</i>

31:21.947 --> 31:24.648
-He just needs a longer hose.
-[kris] [bleep]

31:24.650 --> 31:27.117
kris' girlfriend told him
that lots of times.

31:28.153 --> 31:29.486
[kris speaking]

31:29.488 --> 31:31.355
[brad]
<i>  he's sitting right here,</i>
<i>  you want to talk to him?</i>

31:31.357 --> 31:33.056
[kris speaking]

31:34.326 --> 31:37.427
<i> -[andy] you on any gold?</i>
<i> -[kris speaking]</i>

31:37.429 --> 31:38.362
okay.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.529
[kris speaking]

31:40.900 --> 31:42.532
<i> [andy] wave that wand, dude.</i>

31:42.534 --> 31:45.035
<i>  You want the gold...</i>
<i>  You want me to get down there</i>
<i>  and find it for you?</i>

31:45.037 --> 31:46.270
[kris speaking]

31:52.311 --> 31:54.077
well, just [bleep]
discover it already.

31:54.079 --> 31:55.245
[kris speaking]

31:58.217 --> 31:59.516
tell him to come on up then.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.085
Okay. Hook the dog
and let's go.

32:03.956 --> 32:05.022
[kris] [bleep]

32:08.661 --> 32:10.527
kris is coming up,
here he comes.

32:19.004 --> 32:20.470
Oh, how was it?

32:20.472 --> 32:23.840
Well, if there is gold here,

32:23.842 --> 32:25.008
it's so far down

32:25.010 --> 32:28.211
-that it's not
profitable to get.
-[brad] okay.

32:28.213 --> 32:30.380
[kris] it's a sand pit
down there too.

32:30.382 --> 32:31.982
Visibility sucks.

32:32.918 --> 32:34.084
This is another setback

32:34.086 --> 32:36.753
with a season
filled full of setbacks.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.121
<i>  I've got brand new equipment</i>

32:38.123 --> 32:40.157
<i>  and I've got</i>
<i>  a great team behind me,</i>

32:40.159 --> 32:41.325
<i>  but the hose is short,</i>

32:41.327 --> 32:44.127
<i>  we're in debt</i>
<i>  and I'm not seeing any gold.</i>

32:44.129 --> 32:45.862
What kind
of an operation is this?

32:45.864 --> 32:47.130
This is such a joke, man,

32:47.132 --> 32:49.866
and we still
don't have any gold at all.

32:49.868 --> 32:53.136
It's been one [bleep] problem
after another problem.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.506
I don't know what the [bleep]
<i>  I'm going to do.</i>

33:00.112 --> 33:03.347
[narrator]
<i>  and now another episode</i>
<i>  of social hour with vernon.</i>

33:05.084 --> 33:06.450
So what have we got here?

33:07.920 --> 33:10.320
Next, batter up, kit smears.

33:10.956 --> 33:13.623
[reading]

33:16.061 --> 33:18.929

33:18.931 --> 33:20.163
We're on the gold.

33:20.165 --> 33:23.367
This claim out here
is loaded, baby.

33:24.203 --> 33:27.004
[reading]

33:31.210 --> 33:32.776
that's a good question.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.311
I've had a few good seasons,

33:34.313 --> 33:37.381
but I haven't topped
100 ounces since that year,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.616
and the weather
has a lot to do with it.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.153
Somebody named
"loves it big,"

33:44.156 --> 33:46.990
"vernon..." [reading]

33:49.895 --> 33:52.763
if I wasn't making
more than I spend,

33:52.765 --> 33:55.032
do you think I'd be here?
No.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.233
I mean,
you don't know everything

33:56.235 --> 33:57.267
there is to know in my life.

33:57.269 --> 33:59.936
You can't operate on
a zero balance.

33:59.938 --> 34:03.206
I mean, I am actually
making more than I spend,
believe it or not.

34:03.208 --> 34:05.108
All you guys
out there saying,

34:05.110 --> 34:06.376
"you know,
vernon can't find gold,

34:06.378 --> 34:08.111
couldn't find gold
if he fell on it,"

34:08.113 --> 34:11.214
well guess what, [bleep].
I'm doing it. You're not.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.216
And you're watching.

34:13.218 --> 34:16.553
Okay, I live it.
You watch it on tv. [bleep]

34:17.623 --> 34:19.122
<i> [narrator] this has been</i>
<i>  another episode</i>

34:19.124 --> 34:21.224

[steve] whoo-hoo!

34:36.408 --> 34:39.409
Here comes gabe to the rescue
with a new generator.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.532
[gabe] I didn't want him
out of the water

35:02.534 --> 35:05.869
for long enough to really
lose steam and get cold.

35:05.871 --> 35:09.206
[steve] he's fine. He's now
in the meditative mode,
so he's good to go.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.245
<i> [zeke] I feel like we're</i>
<i>  losing our way this winter.</i>

35:15.247 --> 35:17.147
I know that there are

for all situations,

35:18.784 --> 35:23.120
<i>  but at present we are kind</i>
<i> of going down a negative path.</i>

35:24.156 --> 35:26.256
But it doesn't have
to be this way.

35:26.258 --> 35:27.791
We just need to focus up,

35:27.793 --> 35:30.127
double down
and start off clean.

35:31.130 --> 35:33.330
[steve] all right.
Should fire right up.

35:36.235 --> 35:37.334
Is it going?

35:39.238 --> 35:43.673
So now we're back
in the water in five minutes.

35:43.675 --> 35:46.009
[gabe] there's
countless things
that can [bleep] out here,

35:46.011 --> 35:49.079
and we just lost
the generator to one.

-[gabe] oh, buddy.
-[zeke] yeah.

37:42.194 --> 37:44.160
-[zeke] I'm way out there.
-[gabe] yeah.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.505
That's scary.
Oh, god.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.175
<i> [zeke] I have noticed</i>
<i>  in life that sometimes</i>

37:59.177 --> 38:01.211
it seems like everything
just lines up against you.

38:01.213 --> 38:02.479
Maybe it's bad juju

38:02.481 --> 38:04.281
or it's just things
are out of your control.

38:05.017 --> 38:06.216
<i>  Regardless of why,</i>

38:06.218 --> 38:08.218
that's exactly what's
happening right now.

38:08.220 --> 38:10.987
[gabe] it's like the scariest
thing about ice mining.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.255
Every single one
of your breaths

38:12.257 --> 38:13.857
could be your last breath.

38:13.859 --> 38:15.825
And it sounds
all melodramatic,

38:15.827 --> 38:18.161
but it's actually
completely accurate.

38:18.163 --> 38:20.230
-[zeke] it's not
an exaggeration.
-[gabe] at all.

38:20.232 --> 38:24.200
That's terrifying,
and there's nothing that
you can do about it up top.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.869
I know how to find gold.

38:25.871 --> 38:27.804
I've done it my whole
entire working life,

38:27.806 --> 38:29.239
<i>  so it's just maddening to me</i>

38:29.241 --> 38:31.641
<i>  that I can't get under</i>
<i>  the ice and find it.</i>

38:31.643 --> 38:33.877
We need to regroup
and alter course fast

38:33.879 --> 38:36.279
because right now my back
is up against the wall.

38:39.384 --> 38:41.084

Give us a nice start
for summer

38:54.666 --> 38:57.133
and take some
of the pressure off.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.837
There's definitely a pile
of gold on the compound.

[joe] yeah, with all
the minerals we're
seeing over there.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.240
There's something big.

39:18.357 --> 39:19.823
Oh, that's the last of it.

39:19.825 --> 39:23.293
Let's get the stuff dry
and see what we have.

39:23.295 --> 39:24.661
Put her on the scale.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.343

Oh, yeah.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.904
We'll get on it.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.173
This clean up proved that
I'm still on the right track.

40:10.175 --> 40:11.875
I'm gonna find that jackpot

40:11.877 --> 40:14.778

to be something to remember.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.346

40:16.348 --> 40:19.048
from that 120 ounces I need.
