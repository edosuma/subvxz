NARRATOR: Four weeks ago,
a dome crashed on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.461
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.090
forcing each of us to confront
our own personal demons:

00:14.848 --> 00:15.883
Rage.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.678
Grief.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.642
- Fear.
- My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.430
Now in order to survive,

00:24.608 --> 00:27.520
we must battle
our most dangerous adversary:

00:28.028 --> 00:30.110
The enemy within.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.113
Something's wrong
with the dome, Joe.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.615
It's calcifying.
I will get the dome down before then.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.868
The transmitter from the radio station?
I can use it

00:38.038 --> 00:39.539
to amplify the tones for the device.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.788
Is my daughter in there? Stop!

00:46.213 --> 00:49.046
The thing that came out of the cocoon,

00:49.216 --> 00:50.706
I think that is your baby.

00:52.469 --> 00:56.178
It's you.
You have your father's eyes.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.476

01:09.236 --> 01:11.147
WOMAN:
This isn't our home anymore.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.529
Our freedom awaits us
on the other side of the dome.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.198
And I will guide you to it.

01:17.160 --> 01:18.900
That's why I've called you here.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.741
Christine's reign is over.

01:23.458 --> 01:28.452
She fulfilled her purpose
to create a new, stronger queen.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.040

01:30.215 --> 01:34.709
I am here to lead you, our Kinship,
out of the dome

01:34.886 --> 01:36.717
to prevent the extinction
of our species.

01:37.222 --> 01:42.182
What once protected us
is now strangling us.

01:44.521 --> 01:49.231
But before we can move on,
we must stop a dire threat

01:49.943 --> 01:51.934
that will do anything to thwart us.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.987
There's an enemy within.

How will we even go back
to our old lives?

I don't know that we can.

is getting out of this dome. Together.

JIM:
Hey, Romeo and Juliet,

02:21.016 --> 02:24.008
how about a little less standing around
and more getting us out of here?

02:24.186 --> 02:26.893
Once I get the solar panels online,
I can power up the transmitter.

to keep it from overheating.

02:30.776 --> 02:32.858

Come on, let's just go find Christine.
She's had some rest.

Maybe she'll remember something
that could help us.

How do I know that you'll cooperate

"Tragically, most of the town expired
when the dome came down,

30:05.637 --> 30:07.218
leaving only a few survivors."

30:07.389 --> 30:09.129
So you're talking about those of uS

30:09.308 --> 30:11.264

of an alien infection.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.675
Correct.

in you and the others,

you will have your freedom.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.908
Speak about aliens
from a distant home world,

31:16.583 --> 31:19.700
or Should the word "Kinship"
be even whispered

31:19.878 --> 31:22.085
in conspiracy-theory circles,

31:22.255 --> 31:26.043

and your freedom will be forfeit.

You see, the way I see it,

32:03.171 --> 32:05.127
you've got a lot of explaining to do.

32:05.298 --> 32:09.667
I mean, after all, the dome was
an international media sensation.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.710

what happened?

for the truth?

32:21.356 --> 32:25.440

32:25.610 --> 32:28.852

do the talking for you.

Will people believe him?

to tell your story.

who lived through the events,

32:50.760 --> 32:53.968
a pillar of Chester's Mill community,

32:54.556 --> 32:56.842
whom everybody will believe.

to an Eskimo.

They're called Inuits.
