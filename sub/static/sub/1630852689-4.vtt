WEBVTT

00:33.616 --> 00:36.369
- I'll be waiting outside.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.114
Paula, how do you feel?

03:22.869 --> 03:23.870
Not good.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.750
We had to give you a large dose
of tranquilizers when we found you.

03:31.544 --> 03:34.839
We had no other option.
It was for your own good. You understand?

03:35.924 --> 03:37.008
Of course.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.803
For my own good.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.391
Thanks for taking care of me, Doctor.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.981
Hey, Paula.

03:52.774 --> 03:53.942
It's me.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.698
Almeida.

04:00.865 --> 04:02.492
No, Paula. It's Marques.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.579
Almeida has my daughter, Marques.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.165
Get him.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.295
Don't worry.

04:14.838 --> 04:18.466
We already got him.
He's not hurting anyone ever again, Paula.

04:19.175 --> 04:20.677
That son of a bitch--

04:20.760 --> 04:22.762
That son of a bitch
has my daughter, Marques.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.601
I'm sorry, Paula, but that's not possible.
He's been arrested.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.564
I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.

04:32.647 --> 04:33.648
Paula.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.319
Your daughter died in a car crash.

04:40.238 --> 04:43.908
You saw it yourself.
You had a nervous breakdown.

04:43.992 --> 04:46.953
And that's why you're here. I'm sorry.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.581
That's not it.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.208
That's not it.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.794
I saw her.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.547
It was her.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.634
I hugged her.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.386
I stood by her side.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.930
I just couldn't save her.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.435
She's alive, Marques. She's alive.

05:10.935 --> 05:13.355
Where did you see her, Paula? Where?

05:18.610 --> 05:20.028
Outside the hospital.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.825
Hole in the fence.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.453
The woods.

05:29.621 --> 05:30.747
Tunnel.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.085
Dark. Hole.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.381
It looked like an old hospital.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.966
Chapel.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.720
A chapel. You have to go there.
You have to go there, Marques.

05:46.429 --> 05:51.059
We have a deactivated ward, but it's been
abandoned for as long as I can remember.

05:53.978 --> 05:55.730
That son of a bitch is there.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.733
Almeida is there.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.110
That's impossible.

06:00.777 --> 06:06.449
Almeida's in his room,
under watch 24 hours a day.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.578
That's not true, Marques.
I can assure you that's not true.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.795
Who found her yesterday?

06:18.878 --> 06:22.424
Nurse Neusa. In the middle of the garden.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.301
I'll need to speak with her.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.013
My daughter is alive, Marques.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.683
Believe me.

07:09.804 --> 07:11.556
What's this tunnel she mentioned?

07:12.390 --> 07:15.602
It could be the entrance
to the abandoned hospital. I'm not sure.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.814
Maybe she isn't crazy after all.

07:23.151 --> 07:27.030
It's not news to anyone that there's
an abandoned ward out in the woods,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.656
not even to my patients.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.786
She might have heard something about it
and made up a story.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.377
She tried to take her own life
during her breakdown.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.548
It's very likely
she'll keep making things up,

07:46.633 --> 07:49.010
or that she'll mix dreams with reality.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.972
That's precisely Paula's pathology.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.433
Do you understand?

07:59.688 --> 08:03.274
Well, I'll have to take her words
into consideration.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.404
And I need access
to this abandoned hospital.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.906
No problem.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.836
One more thing, Doctor.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.339
She said she saw her daughter alive.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.678
And I've had patients who talk to statues.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.350
Seixas.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.480
Please escort this officer to Nurse Neusa.

08:42.564 --> 08:43.565
Yes, sir.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.108
I'll meet you soon.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.164
Please state your name.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.666
Neusa Maurer.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.877
Are you in charge of the night watch?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.339
I need you to speak.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.632
The whole night, every night.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.011
What happened that night, exactly?

09:14.554 --> 09:17.640
During my watch, I noticed that
Mrs. Costa wasn't in her room,

09:17.724 --> 09:19.017
so I went out to find her.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.102
- Don't you lock the doors?
- Yes.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.564
- The doors are locked every night.
- So how did Mrs. Costa leave?

09:27.233 --> 09:30.236
- I need you to speak up.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.782
Well, I reported it to Security,

09:33.865 --> 09:36.534
and we searched for Mrs. Costa
everywhere in the building.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.994
When we couldn't find her,

09:38.078 --> 09:41.039
we went outside to search for her
with help from the guards.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.167
What about Almeida?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.295
Excuse me?

09:47.379 --> 09:49.631
Mrs. Costa insists that she saw Almeida

09:49.714 --> 09:53.468
at some sort of chapel
or abandoned hospital.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.387
That's impossible.

09:56.304 --> 09:57.972
Neusa, explain to the detective--

09:58.056 --> 10:00.850
- Excuse me. What's your name?
- Seixas.

10:01.518 --> 10:02.519
Seixas.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.939
Where were you
between 10:00 p.m. and midnight?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.817
- At home, sleeping.
- Mmm.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.111
So you didn't see or hear anything, right?

10:12.028 --> 10:13.571
I ask the questions here.

10:16.408 --> 10:17.617
Go on.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.871
We follow protocol here
for our shifts and rounds.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.957
It's all recorded in a book.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.835
We can't deviate from this protocol
even in the slightest.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.879
He's locked up in a maximum-security
psychiatric hospital.

10:29.963 --> 10:34.134
Consul Almeida isn't even allowed
to take a walk in the park.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.386
He's kept under lock and key.
He doesn't leave.

10:36.469 --> 10:37.595
So he's locked up.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.973
Locked up like Mrs. Costa?

10:41.808 --> 10:44.352
Ma'am, do you remember
hearing anything strange?

10:45.103 --> 10:46.604
Like screams or banging?

10:48.273 --> 10:53.570
This is a psychiatric hospital.
We hear screams and banging every night.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.283
I'll need to see Almeida.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.702
Of course. Dr. Schultz will escort you.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.752
WARD B
RESTRICTED ACCESS

11:32.359 --> 11:36.988
Help! Get me out of here!

11:41.868 --> 11:44.329
Let me go!

12:13.233 --> 12:15.860
Makes me sick to my stomach
just looking at this son of a bitch.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.447
Well, then?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.078
He had no way of leaving.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.248
Not by himself.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.713
I think we're done.

12:36.381 --> 12:37.382
Right?

13:11.207 --> 13:12.417
AMBULANCE

13:32.687 --> 13:34.522
You're a lucky man, Doctor.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.859
Why do you say that?

13:38.777 --> 13:42.197
Look at this guy! Just a few days ago
he was threatening us, and now he's here.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.491
He looks like a houseplant.

13:46.409 --> 13:50.747
Tell me this isn't luck, Doctor.
Now you can do whatever you want with him.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.378
The only thing I'm doing here
is trying to help him.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.132
I think you should do the same.

14:04.928 --> 14:08.723
That's our job, in case you've forgotten.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.060
I apologize, Doctor.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.518
You're back.

14:57.939 --> 14:59.149
You don't believe me?

15:01.818 --> 15:03.528
I need you, Marques.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.742
Paula, what you need is to stay alive,

15:10.577 --> 15:12.078
not try to kill yourself.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.290
I'd never do that.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.793
Anyone who's lost a child
is capable of doing that, Paula.

15:18.877 --> 15:19.961
No.

15:22.672 --> 15:25.508
Not if you found out
your child may be alive.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.970
What gave you this idea?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.434
Help me.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.899
It was Camila.

15:42.692 --> 15:46.613
Camila told me that
the charred body didn't belong to Lúcia.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.282
And how exactly did Camila tell you?

15:51.284 --> 15:54.537
She found a way to send me a cell phone.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.624
I'm keeping it here with me.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.879
Fuck!

16:03.505 --> 16:06.299
They took it. They took my phone.

16:06.925 --> 16:07.926
Paula.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.014
Even if the body doesn't belong to Lúcia,

16:14.265 --> 16:15.392
that arm does.

16:16.393 --> 16:21.314
Someone who had their arm chopped off
would need immediate medical assistance.

16:21.398 --> 16:24.192
- She was in the middle of nowhere.
- So where's the body?

16:25.735 --> 16:27.362
Where's the body, Marques?

16:28.780 --> 16:31.908
This place in the middle of the woods,

16:32.951 --> 16:34.202
it exists.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.746
They call it hell.

16:37.622 --> 16:42.043
And it was there that I saw
Almeida with Lúcia. I saw it! I did!

16:43.628 --> 16:45.213
"They" who, Paula?

16:46.172 --> 16:47.340
Hell?

16:49.175 --> 16:51.011
These things you're saying,

16:52.554 --> 16:54.764
and the severity of what happened, Paula…

16:56.558 --> 16:57.559
Enough.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.853
You need help, Paula.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.743
What are you doing, Paula?
Stop. Don't do this.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.036
Take a picture.

17:16.119 --> 17:17.746
Paula, don't do this.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.081
Fuck that. Take a picture.

17:21.082 --> 17:22.584
Go on, Marques. Quick.

17:28.006 --> 17:31.843
Like this. One hand beside the other.
Take the fucking picture!

17:32.510 --> 17:34.554
There. There.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.265
Wait.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.060
<i>My shoe's here. Get my shoe.</i>

17:40.143 --> 17:43.229
- What about your shoe?
- Get the fucking shoe.

17:49.861 --> 17:50.987
Give it to Camila.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.073
What is this?

17:53.823 --> 17:55.325
Along with the pictures.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.080
Go on, Marques. Take it!

18:05.919 --> 18:07.128
She's alive.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.382
Believe me.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.178
Marques.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.473
Trust no one.

18:19.891 --> 18:20.892
No one.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.162
Mmm.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.596
The victim is a white male
between 35 and 40 years of age.

21:04.472 --> 21:09.102
Cause of death appears to be due
to a projectile shot from a firearm.

21:19.154 --> 21:22.032
- <i>There is some presence of burnt gunpowder</i>

21:22.115 --> 21:24.367
<i>at the exact point of entry</i>
<i>of the projectile.</i>

21:25.201 --> 21:28.621
<i>There is strong evidence suggesting</i>
<i>the shot was fired at contact range.</i>

21:36.963 --> 21:39.090
- <i>The bullet's exit wound</i>

21:39.174 --> 21:41.134
<i>is much larger than the entry wound.</i>

21:49.267 --> 21:51.102
Their angles also indicate

21:51.186 --> 21:53.938
that the projectile was fired
from the bottom up.

21:56.566 --> 21:59.194
Results of the autopsy
match the police report

21:59.277 --> 22:00.904
given by the experts at the scene:

22:01.571 --> 22:02.781
- suicide.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.242
Far more common than it would seem.

22:07.619 --> 22:08.828
What happened?

22:10.330 --> 22:11.331
Paula.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.667
Paula?

22:15.669 --> 22:16.920
What about Paula?

22:19.714 --> 22:23.426
According to the official report,
she tried to kill herself.

22:25.679 --> 22:27.305
What do you mean? How is she?

22:29.182 --> 22:31.393
Hurt, but fine.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.230
I mean, she's crazy.

22:36.314 --> 22:38.191
She swears she didn't do anything.

22:40.652 --> 22:42.237
I believe her, Marques.

22:48.576 --> 22:52.622
She said these pictures prove that.
What do you think?

22:54.582 --> 22:57.669
This wound was made on her right arm.
Paula's right-handed.

22:57.752 --> 23:01.423
If she'd inflicted that wound, it would've
been on her left arm, and vertical.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.133
I'm not exaggerating when I say

23:03.216 --> 23:06.261
that Paula must have seen
over a thousand cases just like this one.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.805
I can tell you she's an expert on suicide.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.724
If she really did want to kill herself,

23:10.807 --> 23:13.018
she would have done it
as efficiently as possible.

23:13.601 --> 23:16.896
And there's more, Marques.
What was Lúcia's arm doing on the road?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.189
Where's the body?

23:19.315 --> 23:20.316
Well, Camila,

23:21.693 --> 23:24.946
she's convinced she saw Lúcia, alive.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.869
She says you'll find her blood here.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.379
Damn it, Paula!

23:45.508 --> 23:46.760
Camila, look.

23:48.803 --> 23:51.222
A burned body, Lúcia's blood…

23:52.515 --> 23:54.684
If all this craziness
turns out to be true,

23:55.435 --> 23:57.312
don't tell anyone about it, okay?

Come on! Hi, there.

25:35.368 --> 25:38.163
- Is anyone home?

25:38.246 --> 25:39.497
Hey, hey.

25:40.415 --> 25:42.417
- Hey, you.

25:44.252 --> 25:45.462
Is anyone there?

25:52.844 --> 25:54.888
- Who are you?

25:54.971 --> 25:57.807
Whoa, whoa! Relax, relax!
I just want to talk.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.521
- Ernesto.
- Rafael.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.392
Mom.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.272
Sweetie.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.918
I'm looking for you. Where are you?

27:07.002 --> 27:09.087
I'll always be with you.

27:09.796 --> 27:11.214
I'm coming to get you.

27:13.550 --> 27:14.551
Mom.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.337
Your daughter-- how old is she?

27:51.171 --> 27:52.339
Nineteen.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.091
Why do you think she's around here?

27:55.925 --> 27:57.302
Last time she was seen,

27:57.385 --> 28:00.638
she was being followed by a man--
a big man, and tall.

28:01.514 --> 28:05.935
He had a white eye and wore a jacket
with the motto from this cemetery.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.187
This psalm.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.068
Before I lost my eyesight,

28:14.861 --> 28:17.572
I worked construction
at the train station here.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.035
I didn't know my bosses personally.

28:22.786 --> 28:26.456
I only saw them a few times from far away.

28:27.499 --> 28:30.794
They dressed in white.
They looked like doctors.

28:32.545 --> 28:35.840
People around here say they're the ones
who founded this village.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.052
More than 200 families worked here.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.514
But, Ernesto, sir, do you know where
I can find that man?

28:43.306 --> 28:45.183
Nah, not really.

28:45.975 --> 28:49.020
Too many people. Too many families.

28:49.104 --> 28:52.774
This man, the one with the jacket,
he must be around 40 or 50.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.569
All I remember is a white-eyed baby.

28:57.153 --> 28:59.989
He was famous around these parts.
Jerônimo.

29:00.699 --> 29:02.992
He lived near the train station.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.122
And what about this train station?
Is it nearby?

29:07.997 --> 29:10.458
It's a good hour's walk
if you cut through the fields.

29:14.087 --> 29:16.256
But I can go with you if you want, sir.

29:17.215 --> 29:19.551
But it gets cold around here,

29:19.634 --> 29:21.803
and I'm a very tired old man.

29:26.349 --> 29:30.228
If you want, you can spend the night.

29:33.356 --> 29:35.483
Tomorrow morning, I can take you there.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.945
It'll be nice to have someone around
for a change.

29:41.364 --> 29:42.449
Deal.

30:09.476 --> 30:11.227
Lucas, I'm a bit nervous.

30:12.604 --> 30:13.605
I…

30:17.609 --> 30:19.110
I think I love you, Paula.

30:22.072 --> 30:24.407
Do you think
this is how love's supposed to be?

30:25.950 --> 30:28.370
This strong, this intense?

30:30.288 --> 30:31.414
I don't know.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.251
I don't know how to feel all of that.

30:40.131 --> 30:41.216
That smells great.

32:13.683 --> 32:14.893
Calm down, Paula.

32:18.563 --> 32:21.066
Take this, Paula. It'll be good for you.

32:34.412 --> 32:35.872
It was just a nightmare.

32:36.873 --> 32:37.874
Okay?

32:39.084 --> 32:41.628
Come on. Lie down.

32:43.713 --> 32:44.839
Get some rest.
