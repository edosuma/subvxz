WEBVTT

00:11.987 --> 00:13.709
Be an equal part in that
new relationship.

00:13.733 --> 00:15.027
They both want to date you?

00:15.028 --> 00:16.506
If your daughter brought home a couple,

00:16.530 --> 00:17.939
how would you feel about that?

00:17.963 --> 00:19.809
I think you're setting yourself
up for heartache.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.310
<i>You're going through something rough.</i>

00:21.334 --> 00:22.945
Maybe you're just not
in the right relationship.

00:22.969 --> 00:24.859
I-I'm not afraid to go to a group home.

00:24.883 --> 00:26.866
I'm not gonna let them
put you in a group home.

00:26.890 --> 00:29.118
We both want you to stay here.

00:29.142 --> 00:31.890
- You don't have to do this, man.
- I want to do it.

00:33.380 --> 00:36.626
O-Ow! Damn!

00:36.650 --> 00:39.295
I told you it was gonna hurt
a hell of a lot worse

00:39.319 --> 00:41.230
getting that thing taken off
than putting it on.

00:41.254 --> 00:42.965
Ah!

00:42.989 --> 00:44.467
You know what the good news is?

00:44.491 --> 00:46.135
You only got six more sessions to go.

00:46.159 --> 00:48.404
Power-Nine has daggers tatted
all over his face

00:48.428 --> 00:50.673
and he just signed a million
dollar deal with YouTube.

00:50.697 --> 00:52.013
Well, then you go ahead
and get rich and famous,

00:52.037 --> 00:54.310
and you get whatever ink
you want, but in the meantime,

00:54.334 --> 00:55.678
no employer's looking for teenagers

00:55.702 --> 00:57.580
with the penal code for murder
tattooed on their neck.

00:57.604 --> 00:59.348
Aw, don't be so hard on him, Hondo.

00:59.372 --> 01:01.918
Seems like yesterday I was
burning ink like this off you.

01:01.942 --> 01:03.186
You got a tat removed?

01:03.210 --> 01:04.420
What was that girl's name? Um...

01:04.444 --> 01:06.022
Reba? Rosie?

01:06.046 --> 01:07.390
Okay, you're talking way too much.

01:07.414 --> 01:08.858
That was a long time ago, stop.

01:08.882 --> 01:11.661
Yeah, whatever.
I want you to keep it iced,

01:11.685 --> 01:13.930
then apply the lotion to keep it
from scabbing, all right?

01:13.954 --> 01:15.765
And that'll give you
an excuse to cover your neck

01:15.789 --> 01:17.644
for that job interview you have later.

01:20.560 --> 01:22.194
He seem like a good kid.

01:22.622 --> 01:24.122
He's getting himself there.

01:24.447 --> 01:25.608
I just wish his odds of getting a job

01:25.632 --> 01:27.076
were better than going back to lockup.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.199
Well, he got you in his corner.
That ups his chances.

01:31.705 --> 01:34.411
For the record, her name was Rila.

01:34.435 --> 01:37.053
And she gave me all kinds of love
for getting that ink on my arm.

01:37.077 --> 01:40.056
I mean, for the two months that I
was kicking it with her anyway.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.459
How epic was that concert?

01:43.483 --> 01:46.295
I've seen Nick Cave four times
and that was his best show yet.

01:46.319 --> 01:49.065
Here, I added extra turmeric
for inflammation.

01:49.089 --> 01:51.720
- Mmm. I got the Cholula.
- Thank you.

01:55.848 --> 01:56.991
What?

01:57.015 --> 01:58.641
Nothing, it's just you've
stayed over so much

01:58.665 --> 02:00.076
you finally know where everything is.

02:00.100 --> 02:02.245
I guess I'm officially domesticated.

02:02.269 --> 02:04.947
It's a good thing.
It means you're comfortable.

02:04.971 --> 02:06.620
Mm, did you tell her yet?

02:06.644 --> 02:07.814
No.

02:07.838 --> 02:10.887
So, my last sculpture,
it sold for nine grand,

02:10.911 --> 02:12.288
and I'm donating every penny

02:12.312 --> 02:14.423
to the LAPD Fallen Heroes Fund.

02:14.447 --> 02:16.092
And that promo my
marketing team worked on

02:16.116 --> 02:19.328
already has over 500
monetized click-throughs

02:19.352 --> 02:22.932
- to the LAPD website.
- I don't know what to say.

02:22.956 --> 02:25.504
If a cause is important to you,
then it's important to us.

02:30.189 --> 02:32.167
I'm gonna bring you both
to the charity dinner.

02:32.796 --> 02:35.470
I think it's time
my work family meets you both.

02:36.223 --> 02:39.101
- Okay, I have to go. Bye.
- Mm.

02:43.602 --> 02:44.813
Actually, there's something else

02:44.837 --> 02:46.483
we want to talk to you about.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.811
Okay, what?

02:49.948 --> 02:51.782
We want you to move in with us.

02:53.182 --> 02:55.357
Me and Ty feel like our relationship

02:55.381 --> 02:56.525
is in a great place.

02:56.549 --> 02:59.995
And everything just feels really in sync.

03:00.247 --> 03:01.763
We hope you feel the same way.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.292
I do.

03:04.290 --> 03:08.170
Being with both of you has been
amazing. It's just, um...

03:08.194 --> 03:10.772
living together makes things...

03:11.425 --> 03:12.874
official.

03:13.468 --> 03:14.803
Um...

03:15.634 --> 03:18.747
I have to head in, but
give me, give me some time to,

03:18.771 --> 03:19.948
to-to think about it.

03:19.972 --> 03:22.517
- Of course. Yeah.
- No rush.

03:22.541 --> 03:24.475
- Okay.
- We're not going anywhere.

03:26.278 --> 03:27.689
Nothing like a noxious odor complaint

03:27.713 --> 03:29.057
to start the day.

03:31.550 --> 03:34.452
Adam-15! Officers need help!
We have shots fired!

03:37.034 --> 03:38.934
All right, listen up. Patrol call

03:38.958 --> 03:41.221
on 70th popped off
into a firefight with unis.

03:41.245 --> 03:42.622
60 seconds out!

03:42.646 --> 03:44.739
All right, let's come home
alive, write some checks

03:44.763 --> 03:46.608
to the Fallen Heroes Fund
at the charity dinner.

03:46.632 --> 03:47.976
- You bringing Annie?
- Yeah.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.411
It's gonna be our first real night out

03:49.435 --> 03:50.612
since Victoria was born.

03:50.636 --> 03:52.214
How about you, Chris?
You bringing a plus-two?

03:52.883 --> 03:54.249
Roger that.

03:54.273 --> 03:55.427
For real?

03:55.973 --> 03:57.246
We're finally gonna meet the other

03:57.270 --> 03:59.139
- two-thirds of the "throuple"?
- I figured it's time.

03:59.163 --> 04:01.038
Plus, they both donated
serious time and money, so...

04:01.062 --> 04:03.123
Well, anyone who gives to the
fund is a friend of mine.

04:03.148 --> 04:04.759
Amen.

04:04.783 --> 04:06.175
Rolling up in three,

04:06.199 --> 04:07.729
two, one!

04:07.753 --> 04:10.021
Here we go! Another day in paradise.

04:16.862 --> 04:18.273
How many shooters we got?

04:18.297 --> 04:19.608
Can't get a clear look inside,

04:19.632 --> 04:20.976
but we think two.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.911
Been hitting us with large
caliber rounds, guessing AK's.

04:22.935 --> 04:24.179
What's the play, Hondo?

04:24.203 --> 04:27.983
Tan, cover. Cover. Luca,

04:28.007 --> 04:30.285
grab the launchers, we do a good
old-fashioned "smash and gas."

04:30.309 --> 04:31.586
All right, Deac,

04:31.610 --> 04:32.886
you and Chris hit the two.

04:32.910 --> 04:35.090
Luca, Street, hit the four.
Tan, right side.

04:35.114 --> 04:38.182
You cover the one, watch your cross fire.

04:40.619 --> 04:42.320
Move, move, move, move.

04:44.000 --> 04:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:54.099 --> 04:56.000
Ready. Initiate.

05:05.811 --> 05:07.178
On the ground! Now!

05:10.649 --> 05:12.994
Watch your backs, two-by-two.

05:13.018 --> 05:15.463
Get on the ground! On the ground!

05:15.487 --> 05:17.632
Get off!

05:17.656 --> 05:19.501
Hit him with non-lethal.

05:21.160 --> 05:22.327
Get off him!

05:26.031 --> 05:28.476
Swarm! Swarm.

05:28.500 --> 05:31.713
I got his legs!

05:31.737 --> 05:34.683
What the hell's this guy on?

05:34.707 --> 05:37.752
Get him up. Get him up. Chris,

05:37.776 --> 05:39.339
Street, get him out of here.

05:39.364 --> 05:40.476
- Deac, you good?
- Come on.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.691
Yeah. I just got a taste
of some of that spray.

05:42.715 --> 05:45.260
All right, have a medic check
you out. All right? Go.

05:45.284 --> 05:47.385
Tan and Luca, come on.
Let's clear the house.

05:53.926 --> 05:55.103
It's clear.

05:55.127 --> 05:56.173
Clear.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.620
It's a One-Niner stash house.

05:59.644 --> 06:01.583
No wonder they were
lighting up the police.

06:01.607 --> 06:03.901
Yeah, that's got to be, like,
50 G's worth of PCP.

06:05.637 --> 06:06.948
It's Rocket Fuel.

06:06.972 --> 06:08.850
- What, you know that stuff?
- I was fresh out

06:08.874 --> 06:11.453
of the Academy when this junk
first hit the streets in '99.

06:11.477 --> 06:13.088
Tore through my hood pretty bad.

06:13.112 --> 06:16.091
Actually tore all across L.A.
Hundreds of users OD'd,

06:16.115 --> 06:17.723
a lot of 'em ended up in the morgue.

06:17.747 --> 06:19.733
Good thing the banger
out there wasn't armed.

06:19.757 --> 06:20.880
Yeah, well, the next suspect

06:20.904 --> 06:22.720
hopped up on this stuff might be.

06:27.760 --> 06:35.763
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

07:02.818 --> 07:04.313
You called it, Hondo.

07:04.338 --> 07:06.803
The crime lab did a chemical test
on the jug you found.

07:06.828 --> 07:08.706
Came back as pure PCP.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.708
Explains why that One-Niner
was out of his mind.

07:10.732 --> 07:12.624
That's the Rocket Fuel brand.

07:13.201 --> 07:15.012
Was the lab able to trace the recipe?

07:15.036 --> 07:17.781
They were. Turns out
it's an exact chemical match

07:17.805 --> 07:20.217
to a recipe created
by a suspect 20 years ago.

07:20.241 --> 07:21.852
Deacon, how you feeling?

07:21.876 --> 07:24.388
Fine. Come on, it's gonna
take more than a...

07:24.412 --> 07:27.791
few love taps from a spazzed-out
banger to put me back on the DL.

07:28.390 --> 07:29.893
Laroyce Jaekwon,

07:29.917 --> 07:33.330
aka Chef J. He's a PCP
street chemist based

07:33.354 --> 07:35.366
out of South L.A., was never arrested.

07:35.390 --> 07:37.067
That's because Chef J
disappeared a week before

07:37.091 --> 07:39.203
a narcotics sting
was set to take him down.

07:39.227 --> 07:42.475
Yeah. It was rumored that he
ghosted L.A. back then

07:42.499 --> 07:44.352
with $10 million cash
stuffed in Hefty bags.

07:44.379 --> 07:45.570
Well, maybe after 20 years,

07:45.594 --> 07:48.306
Chef J ran out of money, he's
back to make a final payday.

07:48.330 --> 07:49.783
I'll put a call into Narcotics,

07:49.807 --> 07:51.792
see if they have any intel
on him being back in the city.

07:51.816 --> 07:53.026
All right, keep your phones close.

07:53.026 --> 07:55.137
Until we find out where
this next batch of Rocket Fuel

07:55.161 --> 07:56.795
is coming from, we are on high alert.

08:07.340 --> 08:11.353
Hey. Damn One-Niner smacked me
square in the ear.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.622
It still stings like hell.

08:13.646 --> 08:15.512
Cartilage is the worst.
This, uh, methed-out

08:15.536 --> 08:16.992
Mongol cracked me in the nose once,

08:17.016 --> 08:18.828
my eyes watered for two days.

08:18.852 --> 08:20.463
Best medicine's tequila,

08:20.487 --> 08:22.821
but I wouldn't recommend it on duty.

08:24.557 --> 08:26.284
Hey, I, um...

08:26.598 --> 08:28.307
I have something I need to run by you.

08:28.331 --> 08:30.011
I am your confession booth.

08:30.702 --> 08:32.904
Ty and Kira asked me
to move in with them.

08:32.905 --> 08:36.017
Wow. That-That's major.

08:36.041 --> 08:39.187
I know, but they're awesome.

08:39.211 --> 08:41.022
I mean,

08:41.046 --> 08:43.491
being with them has been
better than any other

08:43.515 --> 08:45.160
one-on-one relationship I've ever had.

08:45.508 --> 08:47.085
They cancel their wedding?

08:48.587 --> 08:51.014
I've been helping send out invites.

08:51.924 --> 08:53.683
It's gonna be '80s goth themed.

08:54.976 --> 08:58.907
Look, I am really glad

08:58.931 --> 09:01.142
that you are happy now,

09:01.166 --> 09:04.879
but after the honeymoon, I mean,
what exactly are you to them?

09:07.006 --> 09:08.539
Sorry, one sec.

09:09.668 --> 09:10.909
Jim Street.

09:12.204 --> 09:14.405
Fraudulent charges?

09:16.015 --> 09:17.826
Actually, uh,

09:17.850 --> 09:21.763
can you just, uh, just e-mail me
a list of the charges?

09:21.787 --> 09:24.566
- Thank you.
- What's up?

09:24.590 --> 09:26.835
I got a fraud alert from my bank

09:26.859 --> 09:28.770
for a credit card
that I never applied for.

09:28.794 --> 09:30.171
Remember, like, a month ago,

09:30.195 --> 09:32.374
I told you my mom, she went MIA,

09:32.398 --> 09:34.576
- skipped parole.
- Yeah, I...

09:34.600 --> 09:35.827
This credit card, you think it's her?

09:35.851 --> 09:38.079
Maybe, maybe. Can we, uh,

09:38.103 --> 09:40.503
talk about the relationship
thing later? I'm sorry.

09:40.527 --> 09:41.939
Don't worry.

09:45.244 --> 09:48.123
Listen, Hondo, I know an ex-cop
who might be able to help.

09:48.147 --> 09:51.026
Ben Mosley. Worked a Narco team
out of South Bureau

09:51.050 --> 09:52.293
when Rocket Fuel hit the streets.

09:52.317 --> 09:55.263
Tan, you were just a kid
when Chef J was slinging poison.

09:55.287 --> 09:57.565
How'd you get connected
to a Narco cop from the '90s?

09:58.331 --> 10:01.102
My cousin, Zee. He, uh,

10:01.126 --> 10:03.336
died when he was 18 and I was ten.

10:03.829 --> 10:06.441
My parents told me Zee
was killed in a car accident,

10:06.465 --> 10:08.710
but the story never added up to me.

10:08.734 --> 10:11.184
When I was a senior in
high school, I did some digging.

10:11.208 --> 10:13.054
I found Zee's death certificate.

10:13.391 --> 10:15.083
Mosley was the cop who signed it.

10:15.107 --> 10:16.674
And it wasn't a car crash?

10:17.983 --> 10:21.980
Nah. Turns out my cousin was an addict.

10:23.064 --> 10:26.227
In and out of rehab.
Mosley was the officer

10:26.251 --> 10:28.403
who discovered his body in an alley.

10:29.021 --> 10:31.589
Pumas stripped off his feet.

10:33.565 --> 10:35.610
OD'd on Rocket Fuel.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.381
I'm sorry, man.

10:38.997 --> 10:40.608
My cousin.

10:40.999 --> 10:43.611
He's what motivated me to join LAPD.

10:44.502 --> 10:46.614
And Mosley, Chef J was his white whale?

10:46.638 --> 10:48.143
The one who got away?

10:48.167 --> 10:50.652
- Mosley's got a deep file on him.
- All right.

10:50.676 --> 10:52.954
If you think it's worth a shot,
you grab another team member

10:52.978 --> 10:54.622
and you go see what Mosley has to say.

10:54.646 --> 10:56.147
Yeah.

10:58.183 --> 11:00.877
I'm telling you, there is
nothing kosher going down

11:00.901 --> 11:02.764
with your husband at that massage parlor

11:02.788 --> 11:04.866
after 10:00 p.m.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.968
I'm gonna need to call you back.

11:07.666 --> 11:10.205
Damn. Victor, you're looking good.

11:10.229 --> 11:12.807
You, too, Ben.

11:12.831 --> 11:14.676
Ten years on the job,
you still can't tell a lie

11:14.700 --> 11:15.977
to save your life.

11:16.001 --> 11:17.145
Let me guess.

11:17.702 --> 11:19.047
Deacon.

11:19.071 --> 11:20.648
- How'd you know?
- Victor told me

11:20.672 --> 11:22.951
all about his team, and you look
like a man that goes to church.

11:22.975 --> 11:25.286
- I'll take that as a compliment.
- Every squad needs

11:25.310 --> 11:26.961
a man of God for insurance.

11:27.719 --> 11:30.531
Victor tells me you found
a jug of Rocket Fuel.

11:30.682 --> 11:34.062
And that son of a bitch
Chef J is back in action.

11:34.086 --> 11:35.697
Well, we're not sure
if it's actually him,

11:35.721 --> 11:37.899
or just someone copying his old recipe.

11:37.923 --> 11:40.535
Chef J was very protective of his stew.

11:40.559 --> 11:45.240
Anyone found stealing or trying
to imitate it ended up dead.

11:45.264 --> 11:47.208
- How'd he never get taken down?
- He donated

11:47.232 --> 11:48.343
over a million dollars to charities

11:48.367 --> 11:51.212
in the hood, gave AAU teams

11:51.236 --> 11:53.117
free kicks and jerseys.

11:53.142 --> 11:54.262
Chef J bought off the neighborhood

11:54.287 --> 11:55.506
so no one would testify against him.

11:55.531 --> 11:57.986
That's right. And he also washed
cash through a record label.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.320
After he disappeared, it went bankrupt.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.890
That's why, when I saw this
a few months ago,

12:01.914 --> 12:03.324
I cut it out.

12:03.348 --> 12:07.228
New rapper calling himself
PC-Pak just hit the scene.

12:07.252 --> 12:10.999
Lyrics all about cooking
Rocket Fuel, dodging police,

12:11.023 --> 12:13.034
bragging about how Chef J
was backing his music career.

12:13.058 --> 12:14.936
Well, maybe this kid's
just using Chef J's name

12:14.960 --> 12:16.671
to bolster his own street cred.

12:16.695 --> 12:20.909
Rappers are known to exaggerate,
but I listened to his CD.

12:20.933 --> 12:24.179
PC-Pak rapped about Rascher pickles.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.381
Brand of pickle jars Chef J used to store

12:26.405 --> 12:28.183
his ingredients for PCP.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.487
Wait, that was never made public.

12:29.512 --> 12:31.252
I wouldn't have laid it on
you unless my gut told me

12:31.276 --> 12:32.410
it was worth running down.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.090
Come on, now. Talk to me.

12:36.114 --> 12:37.125
Talk to me, Mama.

12:37.149 --> 12:39.127
- Huh?
- Mmm.

12:39.151 --> 12:40.762
It needs a little more cayenne.

12:40.786 --> 12:42.367
Mama, you gonna stand
over my pot all night?

12:45.424 --> 12:46.666
Hey.

12:47.326 --> 12:48.903
That ain't where that goes.

12:48.927 --> 12:50.461
What's the matter, Darryl?

12:51.496 --> 12:52.707
Hey.

12:52.731 --> 12:54.375
Pick that up.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.100
Pick up the bag.

12:58.604 --> 13:00.748
Now, why don't you calm down
and tell us what's going on?

13:00.772 --> 13:02.717
I wore this dress shirt, I shook

13:02.741 --> 13:04.552
the manager's hand, I looked him
in the eye and told him

13:04.576 --> 13:06.087
how bad I really wanted the job.

13:06.111 --> 13:07.989
And he just kept on bringing up
my arrest record.

13:08.730 --> 13:10.124
Darryl,

13:10.148 --> 13:11.593
listen to me.

13:11.617 --> 13:13.328
You are a juvenile felon.

13:13.352 --> 13:15.330
If you think an employer's
not gonna judge you for that,

13:15.354 --> 13:16.798
you better wake up to reality.

13:16.822 --> 13:18.689
Man, what's the point in even trying?

13:18.713 --> 13:21.135
The point is you don't quit.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.171
You keep knocking on doors until somebody

13:23.195 --> 13:25.473
takes a chance on you just like we did.

13:25.497 --> 13:28.309
You want some gumbo?
It's practically ready.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.078
I ain't hungry.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.980
Go ahead and starve, then.

13:32.004 --> 13:33.748
That's another real good choice, Darryl.

13:38.810 --> 13:40.955
You know, Mama,

13:40.979 --> 13:43.658
maybe we could just trade him in
for a pit bull from the pound.

13:43.682 --> 13:45.660
You know? It'd be
a lot less temperamental.

13:45.684 --> 13:49.297
Darryl is just a teenager still
trying to figure it out.

13:49.321 --> 13:52.523
Give him time, baby.
Just give him some time.

13:58.397 --> 14:00.698
...University housing complex.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.477
Police describe the attacker

14:02.501 --> 14:04.779
as a male under the influence of PCP.

14:04.803 --> 14:06.381
The victim is currently
in intensive care...

14:06.405 --> 14:08.616
Of all the drugs to make a comeback, huh?

14:08.640 --> 14:11.619
Yeah. What's up, kid?

14:11.643 --> 14:14.389
My mom. I think I know where she is.

14:14.413 --> 14:15.890
Her P.O. finally tracked her down?

14:15.914 --> 14:17.959
No, I got a fraud alert for a credit card

14:17.983 --> 14:19.961
I never signed up for,
and it's got to be her.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.896
They had her real maiden name
as the security question.

14:21.920 --> 14:25.317
That's charges from the last two
weeks, all in the Pacoima area.

14:25.341 --> 14:27.535
Liquor stores, motels, men's clothing?

14:27.559 --> 14:29.470
Yeah. It's probably
some cokehead boyfriend,

14:29.494 --> 14:31.339
living it up while they ruin my credit.

14:31.363 --> 14:33.975
Street, it could be a predator
who's got her strung out.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.145
Listen, if it was me, I'd at
least want to know she was safe.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.347
- Did you cancel the card yet?
- Not yet.

14:39.371 --> 14:41.849
Okay, good. Don't. The next
time a charge shows up,

14:41.873 --> 14:43.918
- you take off and you track it down.
- Okay.

14:43.942 --> 14:45.553
- You just give me a heads-up.
- Yeah.

14:45.577 --> 14:47.055
- All right.
- Hey, guys.

14:47.079 --> 14:49.280
I got something you're gonna want to see.

15:11.636 --> 15:15.550
Introducing Peter
Watkins, aka PC-Pak, 22.

15:15.574 --> 15:17.952
Priors for concealed weapons
and possession.

15:17.976 --> 15:19.854
Well, based on his
lyrics, it sounds like he knows

15:19.878 --> 15:21.756
a lot of intimate details about Chef J.

15:21.780 --> 15:24.392
A new studio downtown,
four Aston Martins,

15:24.416 --> 15:26.894
Rolexes worth more than my yearly salary.

15:26.918 --> 15:28.930
Think he bought all that bling
off his music?

15:28.954 --> 15:31.899
Had the tech boys work on all
six of Watkins's cell phones.

15:31.923 --> 15:33.718
Since we made the bust
at that stash house,

15:33.742 --> 15:35.069
he's dropped them all.

15:35.093 --> 15:37.071
Not one of them has
received a text or a call.

15:37.095 --> 15:39.607
So Watkins is laying low,
hoping the heat dies down.

15:39.631 --> 15:42.110
This rapper's the best
connection we've got so far?

15:42.134 --> 15:43.282
Think he'd listen to my demo tape?

15:43.307 --> 15:45.246
Let's find out. Gear up.

15:45.270 --> 15:47.271
You, too, DJ Pasty.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.595
LAPD, drop your guns!

16:00.619 --> 16:01.729
I wouldn't do that if I were you!

16:01.753 --> 16:03.131
- We got permits.
- And we got a warrant

16:03.155 --> 16:04.265
out for Peter Watkins!

16:04.289 --> 16:05.733
How about you show us that warrant?

16:05.757 --> 16:07.502
Put the gun down!

16:07.526 --> 16:09.103
Hold the hell on!

16:09.127 --> 16:12.029
Hold up! Y'all better not
get blood on my driveway!

16:15.560 --> 16:16.894
Drop it.

16:18.937 --> 16:20.148
Damn, y'all looking to get cheese-grated?

16:20.172 --> 16:22.940
That's LAPD SWAT, fool!

16:25.544 --> 16:28.212
Tell me what you know about Chef J.

16:29.281 --> 16:30.691
<i>All clear.</i>

16:30.715 --> 16:32.260
And we didn't find any evidence of PCP.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.961
Your boys are armed to the teeth

16:33.985 --> 16:35.342
but they don't know your real name.

16:35.367 --> 16:36.829
You want to tell us
what the hell's going on?

16:36.854 --> 16:38.599
Those ain't my boys.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.435
All right? They're just
some thugs I pay to be.

16:43.214 --> 16:44.717
Mama never had a nickel to spare,

16:44.741 --> 16:47.508
but she made me take lessons growing up.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.211
Look at me now.

16:50.235 --> 16:53.454
Stacks in the bank,
not a dollar to be proud of.

16:53.478 --> 16:54.970
How'd you know so much about Chef J?

16:54.994 --> 16:57.245
I did a research paper on him. In my, uh,

16:57.269 --> 17:00.188
Figures in 20th Century
class. The best essay I ever wrote.

17:00.212 --> 17:01.956
You're telling us
that you paid for this lifestyle

17:01.980 --> 17:03.991
- without slinging weight?
- That's the beauty of merchandising.

17:04.015 --> 17:06.290
Man, you wouldn't believe what I
rake in off T-shirt sales alone.

17:06.315 --> 17:07.917
Then what's with the hired guns?

17:10.555 --> 17:14.682
Look, man, a couple days
ago, these dudes barged in here,

17:14.705 --> 17:17.672
and they said Chef J wanted me to
cease and desist rapping about him.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.741
Look, they said they was gonna
slice my mama's throat.

17:21.065 --> 17:22.742
Right in front of me.

17:23.025 --> 17:24.545
And then do me.

17:25.611 --> 17:29.217
So I canceled my tour
dates, dropped my phones.

17:29.241 --> 17:31.519
Hired the posse.

17:31.543 --> 17:34.755
The dudes who braced you, do you
know what set they were from?

17:34.779 --> 17:36.757
It was old school O.G.s.

17:36.781 --> 17:39.527
Prison tats. Main dude had a do-rag.

17:39.551 --> 17:41.229
They called him Chipper.

17:41.253 --> 17:44.232
Until your intel's verified,
you're coming downtown.

17:44.256 --> 17:47.702
Hey, man, I'm so tired
of trying to be hard.

17:51.930 --> 17:53.931
Let's go.

17:56.601 --> 17:58.913
Ran the alias "Chipper" through
the database and got a hit.

17:58.937 --> 18:00.915
Byron Reid, 48.

18:00.939 --> 18:03.184
He's spent more time in Folsom
than he has on the street.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.886
Where'd Reid get the nickname?

18:04.910 --> 18:06.921
He likes killing his rivals
by unloading entire clips

18:06.945 --> 18:08.890
in their faces, chipping
away at their skulls,

18:08.914 --> 18:10.892
so their funerals are closed-casket.

18:10.916 --> 18:13.461
Lovely. We got an LKA on Reid?

18:13.485 --> 18:16.078
88th Street, born and raised.

18:16.888 --> 18:19.033
According to gang intel,

18:19.057 --> 18:21.225
Chipper rules the block.

18:25.263 --> 18:26.630
Damn.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.094
Hit grandma's, get the gauges.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.256
LAPD SWAT!

18:42.280 --> 18:44.607
They're running for their gun stash!

18:48.960 --> 18:50.337
Give me that damn hand!

18:57.354 --> 18:58.621
I'm going hands-on.

19:02.593 --> 19:04.327
Give me your hands!

19:07.672 --> 19:09.715
Keep on him, Deac, I got the three!

19:14.479 --> 19:15.680
Move, Grandma!

19:19.718 --> 19:21.685
All right, stay down, stay down.

19:23.888 --> 19:25.366
Byron Reid,

19:25.390 --> 19:27.291
LAPD! We've got a warrant
for your arrest!

19:32.279 --> 19:34.542
Shots fired! Northwest building!

19:34.566 --> 19:36.800
Hang tight, Deac,
I'm getting eyes on the suspect.

19:39.904 --> 19:41.080
Don't even think about it!

19:42.007 --> 19:43.907
Drop your weapon, show me your hands!

19:52.383 --> 19:54.878
Look, we know Chef J sent you
to threaten Peter Watkins.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.948
How much he paying you
to act as his muscle?

19:57.430 --> 20:01.107
Check this out, Chip.
I know you got a rep to protect,

20:01.513 --> 20:03.536
but if you don't give up Chef J,
you're gonna go back

20:03.560 --> 20:05.821
to a box in Folsom for a long-ass time.

20:06.515 --> 20:08.975
What's today? Thursday?

20:10.038 --> 20:12.337
Meat loaf day in county.

20:12.611 --> 20:13.805
Why don't y'all book me

20:13.829 --> 20:16.097
before they stop serving dinner?

20:17.266 --> 20:18.864
Get him out of here.

20:18.888 --> 20:21.479
Keep him in holding
until they're out of meat loaf.

20:24.206 --> 20:25.817
Hey, I just got a credit card alert.

20:25.841 --> 20:27.018
Your mom.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.836
- Go. Go.
- Thanks.

20:29.445 --> 20:32.323
All right, Mosley helped us get
this far. Let's bring him in,

20:32.347 --> 20:34.148
see what else he's got
in those files of his.

20:40.355 --> 20:41.966
Who the hell are you?

20:41.990 --> 20:44.169
Jim Street, the real one.

20:44.193 --> 20:47.438
I got a badge and a gun, so open
up so I don't have to use them.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.567
Am I under arrest?

20:58.111 --> 21:00.426
You're telling me you've never
seen this woman before?

21:00.451 --> 21:03.150
No, sir. Look, I'd love to help you
out, whoever you're looking for,

21:03.174 --> 21:04.637
but I-I've never seen her.

21:04.661 --> 21:06.383
Where'd you get the credit card
from, then?

21:06.407 --> 21:08.741
Bought it for $500 off some
chick that was hard up for cash.

21:08.765 --> 21:10.528
I'm gonna need a name and description.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.864
I know her as Tina.

21:12.888 --> 21:15.756
Met her over at Lonnie's
Tavern o-off the 10.

21:15.780 --> 21:18.336
White girl, um, 20s.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.839
Blonde girl... she had a tattoo
on her arm for "Frezno."

21:21.863 --> 21:25.542
Um, with a Z, not an S,
so maybe not a college girl.

21:25.566 --> 21:28.580
Okay, so "Frezno Tina,"
she say where she got it?

21:28.604 --> 21:31.816
Stole it off a truck driver
that gave her a ride to L.A.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.551
Look, we did a couple shots

21:33.575 --> 21:35.987
of whiskey and she sold me the card

21:36.011 --> 21:37.856
and then I've never seen her since.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.324
Mac Colton?

21:39.615 --> 21:40.859
Yeah.

21:40.883 --> 21:42.727
You ever serve time?

21:44.250 --> 21:45.996
God...

21:46.020 --> 21:48.491
Yes, sir, I did
six months for possession.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.668
Never no felonies, man.

21:50.692 --> 21:51.996
Look, man, I'm sorry.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.166
Just...

21:53.190 --> 21:55.773
about a year ago, I got hurt doing

21:55.797 --> 21:58.168
this drywall job and
I started taking pills

21:58.168 --> 21:59.411
And then...

21:59.435 --> 22:00.980
I lost my house and...

22:01.004 --> 22:02.348
Okay.

22:02.372 --> 22:03.883
Here.

22:05.060 --> 22:07.219
Before I change my mind, man.
Get the hell out.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.488
- Get your bags, get out.
- Thank you.

22:09.512 --> 22:11.213
Thank you, sir.

22:13.516 --> 22:15.261
God.

22:15.285 --> 22:16.996
This map tracks all the violent

22:17.020 --> 22:18.731
PCP-related incidents LAPD officers

22:18.755 --> 22:20.533
have dealt with over the last 24 hours.

22:20.557 --> 22:23.202
Look. Downtown, Venice, Hollywood...

22:23.226 --> 22:25.337
- Rocket Fuel's spreading everywhere.
- It gets worse.

22:25.361 --> 22:27.006
Unis found a hearse in Chipper's garage

22:27.030 --> 22:30.327
reported stolen two days ago
from a Regal Funeral Home

22:30.351 --> 22:32.878
along with a 50-gallon drum
of embalming fluid.

22:32.902 --> 22:34.694
Chef J must be using the embalming fluid

22:34.718 --> 22:36.378
to supercharge his PCP mix.

22:36.402 --> 22:38.617
Mosley, meet Luca and Chris.

22:38.641 --> 22:41.148
Hey, it's an honor, sir.

22:41.172 --> 22:42.855
I've heard nothing but
great things about you from Tan.

22:42.879 --> 22:44.790
- Chris.
- Not sure how much help I can be,

22:44.814 --> 22:47.614
you guys seem to have
every tool at your disposal.

22:47.638 --> 22:50.095
Well, what we don't have is your
firsthand knowledge of the case.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.764
The rapper you put us onto led to

22:51.788 --> 22:53.232
an O.G. working for Chef J.

22:53.256 --> 22:55.201
Yeah, Byron Reid, aka Chipper.

22:55.225 --> 22:56.635
Reid rings a bell.

22:56.659 --> 22:58.356
Can you show me his jail visitors list?

22:58.381 --> 22:59.442
Yep.

22:59.729 --> 23:01.073
Right there.

23:01.097 --> 23:03.503
- Reid, Kendra.
- Do you know her?

23:03.528 --> 23:05.077
Yeah, we picked her up for questioning...

23:05.101 --> 23:07.780
in March of '99. She was a known

23:07.804 --> 23:09.215
associate of Chef J.

23:09.239 --> 23:12.251
And her brother was
a known gang enforcer.

23:12.275 --> 23:14.787
Byron Reid, aka Chipper.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.789
So, Kendra worked for Chef J.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.123
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.826
We suspected Chef J
had Kendra buy properties

23:20.850 --> 23:22.962
in her name but we never
had enough to prove it.

23:22.987 --> 23:24.537
Yeah, real estate's one of the main ways

23:24.562 --> 23:26.298
these drug dealers hide their cash.

23:26.322 --> 23:27.967
Dealers also like to use women to put

23:27.991 --> 23:29.602
anything traceable in their names.

23:29.626 --> 23:32.271
Bank accounts, houses, phones.

23:32.295 --> 23:33.979
Do you have Kendra in that system?

23:34.931 --> 23:37.144
Kendra Reid, priors go back 20 years.

23:37.168 --> 23:39.343
Assault, DUI, pandering...

23:39.367 --> 23:42.613
If she ever posted bail using
an asset, she had to list it.

23:43.539 --> 23:45.451
A dozen properties.

23:45.475 --> 23:48.152
Bars, car washes and a barbecue joint.

23:48.176 --> 23:49.561
If Chef J's back in town,

23:49.585 --> 23:51.624
I'll bet he's back in Kendra's bed, too.

23:51.648 --> 23:53.859
And using one of those properties
for his Rocket Fuel lab.

23:53.883 --> 23:56.929
You're the man, Mosley. Thank you.

23:56.953 --> 23:58.364
Nice work.

23:58.921 --> 24:01.300
Hey, I went by my aunt
and uncle's last night.

24:01.324 --> 24:03.702
I told them I knew the truth
about how Zee died.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.604
You tell them you're finally gonna

24:05.628 --> 24:07.439
catch the suspect responsible?

24:07.463 --> 24:09.108
I couldn't make that promise.

24:09.807 --> 24:11.677
Well, you're going to.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.368
If you get your ass moving.

24:20.343 --> 24:21.987
Yo, what up, Darryl?

24:22.011 --> 24:23.689
- What up?
- Yo, Jarius, Kyree.

24:23.713 --> 24:25.324
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

24:25.348 --> 24:27.459
- You a Jehovah Witness now?
- Uh,

24:27.483 --> 24:30.029
nah, I've just been interviewing
for afterschool jobs.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.698
Yo, hop in.
We're hitting this house party

24:32.722 --> 24:34.133
on 76th.

24:34.157 --> 24:35.668
I'd love to roll with y'all, man,

24:35.692 --> 24:36.858
but I got stuff to handle.

24:39.329 --> 24:40.739
Wait, you're Darryl?

24:41.998 --> 24:43.676
I heard about you.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.145
Yeah, what'd you hear?

24:46.169 --> 24:48.080
Not enough.

24:53.209 --> 24:55.421
- Mama, what are you doing here?
- Sergeant,

24:55.445 --> 24:57.723
I can't believe you never showed
your mother where you work.

24:57.747 --> 25:00.559
Ms. Harrelson, these are delicious.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.594
I see where Hondo gets his
skills in the kitchen.

25:02.618 --> 25:04.671
Oh. Thank you, Captain.

25:04.695 --> 25:07.571
And thank you for giving
me a tour of SWAT.

25:07.595 --> 25:10.025
It's Jessica. And you're welcome.

25:13.563 --> 25:15.407
Jessica.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.344
You two were... together, weren't you?

25:18.368 --> 25:20.412
Okay, you know what, Mama?
We gonna take these

25:20.436 --> 25:22.414
and we're gonna put them in the kitchen.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.216
Jessica...

25:24.240 --> 25:26.552
seems very smart.

25:26.576 --> 25:28.220
Very pretty.

25:28.244 --> 25:29.555
What was wrong with her?

25:31.314 --> 25:33.692
Nothing was wrong with her.

25:33.716 --> 25:35.694
Have you heard from Darryl?

25:35.718 --> 25:39.231
I have called and texted

25:39.255 --> 25:41.433
and you know how I hate that.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.635
Not a peep. Not a one. You?

25:43.659 --> 25:45.971
No. No, I called him

25:45.995 --> 25:47.873
four times, got sent
straight to voice mail.

25:47.897 --> 25:49.975
That kid's really got to be
better about checking in.

25:49.999 --> 25:52.578
Remember I used to send
you off with calling cards

25:52.602 --> 25:54.580
so you could check in on pay phones?

25:54.604 --> 25:56.382
You were about as good at it as he is.

25:56.406 --> 25:58.541
I didn't get arrested for armed robbery.

25:58.565 --> 26:01.920
No. But do you know how many nights
I stayed up worrying about you

26:01.944 --> 26:04.089
running the streets with
your no-good friends?

26:04.113 --> 26:06.507
Including that boy's father, Leroy.

26:07.083 --> 26:08.794
You were no angel.

26:09.843 --> 26:11.563
So how'd you get through to me?

26:11.970 --> 26:14.967
I... tried to put myself in your shoes.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.903
What it was like to be a young black man

26:17.927 --> 26:20.773
without a father's guidance.

26:20.797 --> 26:23.008
Son, this is all part of being a parent.

26:23.032 --> 26:24.810
You can have the best intentions...

26:24.834 --> 26:27.146
it doesn't mean your
child's gonna follow them.

26:28.237 --> 26:30.119
Just let me know if you hear
from him, all right?

26:30.143 --> 26:31.583
I will.

26:32.115 --> 26:34.419
- Captain Cortez and you?
- Oh, come on, Mama.

26:34.443 --> 26:36.422
Could have some really
pretty grandbabies.

26:36.446 --> 26:37.623
I got to get back to work.

26:37.647 --> 26:38.690
- Mama...
- I'm just sayin'.

26:38.714 --> 26:40.082
Uh, are you done?

26:41.717 --> 26:44.363
20 years ago, Chef J put
a number of properties

26:44.387 --> 26:46.691
in Kendra Reid's name. Some she sold,

26:46.715 --> 26:48.445
some are empty lots,

26:48.469 --> 26:50.300
leaving these four buildings.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.305
All of them are in South L.A.,

26:53.329 --> 26:55.040
but they're spread across
different gang territories.

26:55.064 --> 26:58.010
Chef J never affiliated himself
with a specific set.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.898
He wanted bangers of all stripes
to sell his product.

26:59.922 --> 27:01.980
Rules on the street change...
maybe this time

27:02.004 --> 27:04.049
he needed a partner.

27:04.073 --> 27:06.285
Las Profetas, Forty-Twos...

27:06.309 --> 27:08.454
One-Niner turf. That jug of PCP

27:08.478 --> 27:10.289
we found was probably street tax,

27:10.313 --> 27:12.191
letting Chef J cook and distribute.

27:12.215 --> 27:13.782
Can you pull up the floor plans?

27:14.650 --> 27:17.196
Two stories,

27:17.220 --> 27:19.198
reinforced concrete,
ventilation system...

27:19.222 --> 27:20.499
a basement.

27:20.523 --> 27:21.900
Nobody has a basement in L.A.

27:21.924 --> 27:23.235
It's a perfect place for a lab.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.095
That building is currently
listed as a daycare center.

27:28.231 --> 27:29.541
This guy sick enough

27:29.565 --> 27:31.933
to cook toxic drugs
surrounded by a bunch of kids?

27:33.336 --> 27:34.936
Make sure you bring your gas mask.

27:43.459 --> 27:45.459
Hondo, we got ten children,
one female teacher.

27:45.484 --> 27:46.867
No sign of Chef J.

27:46.891 --> 27:49.144
But I spot security cameras
on the one side corners.

27:49.169 --> 27:51.493
All right, roger that.
Keep your eyes open.

27:51.517 --> 27:52.738
Deacon, what do you got?

27:52.762 --> 27:54.218
All quiet on the three side.

27:54.242 --> 27:55.697
Captain, how about you?

27:55.721 --> 27:58.405
I got a white van approaching eastbound.

27:58.429 --> 28:00.537
- You see it, Hondo?
- Affirmative.

28:01.694 --> 28:03.321
Van just made a left.

28:03.346 --> 28:04.605
Deac, you got eyes yet?

28:04.630 --> 28:06.343
Negative. Gonna take a closer look.

28:06.532 --> 28:08.867
- Take the four side.
- Let's go.

28:16.509 --> 28:17.886
Got two male suspects

28:17.910 --> 28:19.497
carrying a 50-gallon drum
into the building.

28:19.521 --> 28:21.201
Looks like we found Chef J's lab.

28:21.225 --> 28:22.462
We need to get those kids out.

28:22.486 --> 28:24.377
Captain, we are formulating a plan.

28:24.401 --> 28:25.819
You move in, and those cameras

28:25.843 --> 28:27.081
will spot you right away. No.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.697
I'm going in as a civilian.

28:28.721 --> 28:30.142
Negative. Negative.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.680
The teacher could be working for Chef J.

28:31.704 --> 28:33.439
Or she has no clue she's in danger.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.352
Either way, those kids
need to be evacuated

28:36.376 --> 28:38.110
before you go in.

28:40.613 --> 28:42.047
Just watch my back.

28:56.396 --> 28:58.507
Miss Rose, I need to go potty.

28:58.531 --> 29:00.076
<i>Mija,</i> I'm helping this nice lady.

29:00.100 --> 29:02.511
Give me a minute,
and I'll take you, okay?

29:02.535 --> 29:04.036
She doesn't have a minute.

29:06.269 --> 29:07.854
I'm with the LAPD.

29:07.878 --> 29:10.086
The building's about to be raided.

29:10.732 --> 29:12.588
I didn't want any part of this. I swear.

29:12.612 --> 29:13.816
He showed up two months ago,

29:13.841 --> 29:16.058
said he would kill my family
if I told anyone he was back.

29:16.082 --> 29:18.027
Chef J? Is he here?

29:18.051 --> 29:21.326
We need to get the kids out of here <i>now.</i>

29:23.056 --> 29:24.733
Okay.

29:24.757 --> 29:27.136
Kids, I'm a friend of Miss Rose's,

29:27.160 --> 29:29.105
and we're all going on a field trip,

29:29.129 --> 29:30.606
- okay?
- Okay.

29:33.333 --> 29:35.211
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hold hands.

29:35.235 --> 29:36.445
- Come on, let's go.
- Holding hands.

29:36.469 --> 29:37.580
A little faster.

29:37.604 --> 29:39.248
Come on. Everyone hold hands.

29:39.272 --> 29:40.672
Hold hands.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.456
The children are evacuated.
You got the green light.

29:48.380 --> 29:49.347
Roger.

29:49.682 --> 29:51.627
LAPD! Show me your hands!

29:51.651 --> 29:54.486
We got a suspect spotted
on the three side.

29:56.256 --> 29:57.856
LAPD SWAT. Drop your weapons!

30:00.460 --> 30:02.838
26-David. We got two suspects down.

30:02.862 --> 30:05.174
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

30:05.198 --> 30:07.443
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine.

30:07.467 --> 30:09.624
Wait. One's missing.

30:11.831 --> 30:13.298
Can you help me?

30:15.630 --> 30:16.986
What's going on, honey?

30:17.010 --> 30:20.356
My teacher and my friends are all gone.

30:20.380 --> 30:22.181
Boss, cops.

30:26.516 --> 30:28.664
Stay with me, honey.
I'm gonna take care of you.

30:28.688 --> 30:30.522
Light it up.

30:32.397 --> 30:33.769
<i>Mandy!</i>

30:33.793 --> 30:36.272
She's still in there. She must
have gone to the bathroom.

30:36.296 --> 30:37.673
This is 20-David to D-team.

30:37.697 --> 30:39.446
Be advised, we still got
a little girl insi...

30:44.037 --> 30:45.814
This is Captain Cortez, LAPD SWAT.

30:45.838 --> 30:48.384
There's been an explosion.
3000 block of South Hoover.

30:48.408 --> 30:50.119
We have a child unaccounted for.

30:50.143 --> 30:52.688
- Are you guys okay?
- Yeah. Tan, mask up.

30:52.712 --> 30:54.190
Team, what's your locations?

30:54.214 --> 30:56.158
22-David, Hondo. We're okay.

30:56.182 --> 30:58.806
30-David. All good here.

30:58.830 --> 31:00.709
All right, listen up.
Watch the perimeter.

31:00.734 --> 31:02.822
Suspects are gonna be
running for fresh air.

31:02.846 --> 31:05.210
Hondo, the fire department
is on its way to clear the building.

31:05.235 --> 31:07.840
They're not gonna enter while there's
armed suspects still inside.

31:12.199 --> 31:14.844
I got eyes on Chef J and two
suspects on the second floor.

31:15.348 --> 31:17.593
They got the girl, and
she's choking on the gas.

31:17.617 --> 31:19.611
Cover the roof. We're headed up.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.808
Suspect one down!

31:31.832 --> 31:33.750
There he is! He's got the girl!

31:37.474 --> 31:39.864
Come here, sweetie, come here.

31:39.888 --> 31:41.132
Come here, come here.

31:43.079 --> 31:44.538
Come here.

31:44.562 --> 31:45.691
I got you.

31:45.715 --> 31:46.926
Put this on your face.

31:46.950 --> 31:48.194
On your face. There you go. Come on.

31:48.218 --> 31:49.695
Let's move, Tan, let's move.

31:49.719 --> 31:51.393
I've got the girl. Evacuate the building.

32:01.131 --> 32:03.075
Remember my cousin?

32:22.758 --> 32:24.662
Hondo, thank God. Where's Tan?

32:24.686 --> 32:26.327
I don't know. I lost him inside.

32:32.101 --> 32:34.001
Tan, where are you?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.505
Tan, come in.

32:39.302 --> 32:41.318
Tan, what is your 20?

32:42.744 --> 32:44.155
Tan!

33:01.797 --> 33:03.531
It's okay, sweetie. You're safe now.

33:16.436 --> 33:18.223
<i>Thank you all for your donations</i>

33:18.247 --> 33:20.725
to the Fallen Heroes Fund,
helping the children

33:20.749 --> 33:23.628
of slain LAPD officers attend college.

33:23.652 --> 33:27.232
So far, we've raised $150,000.

33:27.256 --> 33:29.067
So let's drink to the heroes.

33:29.091 --> 33:30.702
Yeah! Cheers, man.

33:32.828 --> 33:35.073
Hey, you're a lucky man, Deac.

33:35.097 --> 33:36.574
Don't I know it.

33:36.598 --> 33:38.743
Deac, Luca.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.171
This is, uh, Ty and Kira.

33:40.196 --> 33:41.739
- Hey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

33:41.763 --> 33:43.081
What's up? Good to meet you.
What up, bro?

33:43.105 --> 33:44.949
Chris says so many
great things about you.

33:44.973 --> 33:47.152
Please, call me David, and, uh, yeah,

33:47.176 --> 33:48.920
we're-we're grateful
she's always got our back.

33:48.944 --> 33:51.055
So, Ty, Chris says you're a painter.

33:51.079 --> 33:52.255
That's right.

33:52.279 --> 33:53.892
My house needs a new coat, so...

33:53.916 --> 33:54.926
Oh, no. I'm a...

33:54.950 --> 33:56.327
No, I'm kidding, man.

33:57.853 --> 33:59.430
Look, she shows me pics
of all your stuff.

33:59.454 --> 34:01.432
Your paintings are awesome, bro.

34:01.456 --> 34:03.268
It's like abstract expressionism,

34:03.292 --> 34:05.770
but with, like,
a "locals only" surfer vibe.

34:05.794 --> 34:07.672
Thanks, man. Any chance
you write Yelp reviews

34:07.696 --> 34:10.069
- on the side?
- No.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.577
Cheers. Glad you could make it.

34:12.601 --> 34:14.179
I ran into some old-timers
I hadn't seen in years.

34:14.203 --> 34:15.513
It was nice to catch up.

34:15.536 --> 34:17.282
Hey, listen, Chef J,

34:17.306 --> 34:18.983
we wouldn't have caught him without you.

34:19.007 --> 34:20.485
That was all you and your team.

34:20.509 --> 34:23.121
I'm... I'm proud of you, Victor.

34:23.712 --> 34:25.505
Your cousin would be, too.

34:26.681 --> 34:28.159
Thanks, Ben.

34:28.183 --> 34:29.462
That means a lot.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.889
Do you know where, uh, Street is?

34:30.913 --> 34:32.764
No, I think he got stuck somewhere.

34:32.788 --> 34:33.888
I think.

34:37.059 --> 34:38.960
Lila.

34:39.695 --> 34:41.839
Hey.

34:41.862 --> 34:44.297
- Aunt Chris, who are they?
- Who?

34:45.300 --> 34:46.643
You walked in with them.

34:46.668 --> 34:47.946
That's Ty and Kira.

34:48.235 --> 34:49.704
You work with them?

34:49.728 --> 34:51.449
No, they're my boyfriend and girlfriend.

34:52.322 --> 34:55.029
You can be in love with a boy and a girl

34:55.053 --> 34:56.324
at the same time?

34:56.712 --> 34:58.156
Lila, honey.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.792
Let's not ask your Aunt Chris
so many questions, okay?

35:00.816 --> 35:03.294
It's okay, Annie. I-I know it's a...

35:03.318 --> 35:05.223
I know it's a little complicated.

35:05.247 --> 35:06.965
But yes, <i>chiquita.</i>

35:06.989 --> 35:09.067
All three of us, we really
care about each other.

35:09.091 --> 35:12.670
Chris, maybe this is
a conversation for another day.

35:13.219 --> 35:16.431
Uh, hey. Why don't you
go find your dad and find

35:16.455 --> 35:18.843
the biggest cookie that we
can fit in that truck, okay?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.678
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:20.702 --> 35:23.982
I was just trying to be honest.

35:24.773 --> 35:26.566
Maybe a little too honest.

35:28.010 --> 35:31.089
Chris, I love and respect you,
but I just...

35:31.113 --> 35:33.364
I don't want my kids being...

35:33.949 --> 35:35.493
You know?

35:36.117 --> 35:38.196
No, I don't know.

35:38.220 --> 35:41.222
Your kids being what?

35:42.791 --> 35:45.752
Uh, subjected to a lifestyle
that I don't agree with.

35:50.465 --> 35:52.577
Love can work in a lot of ways,

35:52.601 --> 35:54.445
some less traditional than others.

35:54.469 --> 35:56.281
I'm sorry, Chris. You are free

35:56.305 --> 35:58.082
to live your life the way that you want,

35:58.106 --> 36:00.952
but this threesome thing,
it's not normal.

36:00.976 --> 36:03.388
I don't want my kids growing up thinking

36:03.412 --> 36:05.056
it's moral or it's right.

36:05.855 --> 36:08.092
Oh, I-I understand
where you're coming from,

36:08.116 --> 36:10.128
but this is not just a threesome.

36:10.152 --> 36:13.231
It... There's-there's real feelings.

36:13.255 --> 36:15.900
I really don't want to get
into feelings, okay?

36:16.616 --> 36:18.536
Annie, you're-you're the one

36:18.560 --> 36:20.204
that made me Victoria's godmother.

36:20.228 --> 36:22.573
And had I known you were
in this type of relationship,

36:22.597 --> 36:25.433
I... I probably wouldn't have.

36:29.671 --> 36:31.616
Um...

36:32.215 --> 36:33.418
I'm gonna take her home.

36:34.175 --> 36:35.743
Okay, let's go.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.782
I'll talk to her.

37:03.180 --> 37:06.784
Whoever you are, I have a gun
and I'm not afraid to use it.

37:07.584 --> 37:10.321
Oh. Why aren't you at the fund-raiser?

37:10.345 --> 37:11.713
Why aren't you?

37:12.347 --> 37:13.681
Touché.

37:16.426 --> 37:19.297
So it's gonna be one of those nights.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.556
Are you gonna talk or drink?

37:29.698 --> 37:30.975
Hondo.

37:31.748 --> 37:34.084
Haven't seen you since Lieutenant
Gill's retirement bash.

37:34.108 --> 37:35.713
Yeah, that's right.

37:35.737 --> 37:37.348
Just wish it was better circumstances.

37:37.372 --> 37:40.007
- I can explain. I...
- Hey, you better remain silent.

37:41.476 --> 37:43.855
- So what happened?
- Picked up Darryl at a house party.

37:43.879 --> 37:45.823
Lots of liquor and drugs there,

37:45.847 --> 37:47.692
but he blew zero on the breathalyzer.

37:48.208 --> 37:50.523
As a courtesy, I'm releasing him
into your custody.

37:50.547 --> 37:52.997
I really appreciate it, Davis. Thank you.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.688
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

38:00.195 --> 38:03.708
I mean, my mom was never gonna
win "parent of the year" award.

38:05.734 --> 38:08.146
I think we can all agree on that.

38:08.170 --> 38:10.813
She was never much of a mother
to me at all, really.

38:13.969 --> 38:15.820
But if I've pushed her

38:15.844 --> 38:19.023
to a place that she can't
come back from...

38:22.325 --> 38:24.195
I'll never forgive myself.

38:25.415 --> 38:27.432
It's a miracle a woman so
selfish could've given birth

38:27.456 --> 38:29.623
to one of the most
caring guys I've ever met.

38:31.793 --> 38:33.037
Thank you.

38:33.920 --> 38:35.546
Hey, uh...

38:36.598 --> 38:38.342
Aren't Ty and Kira gonna be worried

38:38.366 --> 38:39.844
that you're not home yet?

38:39.868 --> 38:42.713
Well, uh...

38:42.737 --> 38:46.250
Actually, I left them at the fund-raiser.

38:46.274 --> 38:48.853
- Oh. Did you guys get into a fight?
- Mm-mm.

38:48.877 --> 38:50.955
How does that work
with "throuples" anyway?

38:50.979 --> 38:54.392
I mean, do they just tag in,
or they double-team you?

38:54.416 --> 38:56.894
No.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.763
No, I, um...

38:58.787 --> 39:01.065
I actually got into it with Annie.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.633
- Annie?
- Mm-hmm.

39:02.657 --> 39:04.635
- She's a saint.
- I know. I know.

39:05.032 --> 39:06.433
What happened?

39:07.629 --> 39:09.474
- You met Ty, right?
- Yeah.

39:09.498 --> 39:11.108
I-I wanted you to meet Kira,

39:11.132 --> 39:13.044
and I wanted you to hang
out with both of them.

39:13.068 --> 39:14.779
I would've loved to.

39:14.803 --> 39:16.230
I just didn't want to,

39:17.121 --> 39:18.891
you know, bring the mood down, you know?

39:18.916 --> 39:20.098
No.

39:23.011 --> 39:24.822
It's getting late.

39:24.846 --> 39:26.390
I should...

39:26.414 --> 39:27.825
I should get-get going.

39:27.849 --> 39:29.149
All right.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.272
Thanks for always having my six.

39:43.531 --> 39:43.998
Yeah.

40:02.651 --> 40:05.162
I-I think I... I think

40:05.186 --> 40:07.598
- I drank too much whiskey. No, no, no.
- Sorry. Chris, I'm sorry.

40:07.622 --> 40:09.133
No. It's, uh... Whoa.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.502
It's, um... That was, um...

40:11.526 --> 40:12.927
Th-That was, that was my fault.

40:12.951 --> 40:15.940
- It's no one's fault.
- I-I have to get home.

40:15.964 --> 40:17.842
- Let me... Uh, let me get you an Uber.
- No, no, no. I got it.

40:17.866 --> 40:19.110
I got it. I got it. Look. Uber.

40:19.134 --> 40:20.177
- You sure?
- Yep.

40:20.201 --> 40:21.652
I'm good.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.712
Chris, we've been calling you all night.

40:40.736 --> 40:41.923
Where were you?

40:41.947 --> 40:43.501
We were really worried about you.

40:43.525 --> 40:45.192
Sorry.

40:48.697 --> 40:50.207
The answer's "yes."

40:50.231 --> 40:52.176
Yes, what?

40:52.659 --> 40:55.561
Yes, I'll move in with you.

41:01.076 --> 41:03.354
I swear I didn't drink nothing
or mess with any drugs.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.222
Okay. So your job interview went so good,

41:05.246 --> 41:06.991
your friends just went
and threw you a party, huh?

41:07.015 --> 41:08.699
They just wanted to chill.

41:09.417 --> 41:10.701
Listen, kid.

41:11.720 --> 41:14.599
When I was 15, me and my boys,

41:14.623 --> 41:17.034
we got busted for tagging a mini-mart.

41:17.058 --> 41:18.536
We was running from the cops,

41:18.560 --> 41:20.671
we was jumping over fences, and...

41:20.695 --> 41:22.940
This Doberman almost took
a chunk out of my ass, too.

41:22.964 --> 41:24.542
Wait, you used to tag?

41:24.566 --> 41:26.344
Yeah. Yeah, I did a little bit.

41:26.368 --> 41:29.723
I mean, I sucked at it, though,
but, look, what I'm saying is,

41:29.747 --> 41:33.584
even though my mama would've
killed me if she found out,

41:33.608 --> 41:35.553
I was lucky enough
to learn how to say "no"

41:35.577 --> 41:37.455
before it was too late.

41:37.479 --> 41:39.564
I'm so sick of people judging me.

41:40.148 --> 41:43.094
But my boys, they never do.

41:43.118 --> 41:44.629
Your boys ain't gonna judge you

41:44.653 --> 41:46.397
for trying to get your life straight.

41:46.421 --> 41:48.099
Not if they're your real friends.

41:49.115 --> 41:51.035
Look. Look, I just want you to know,

41:51.059 --> 41:52.870
if you ever find yourself

41:52.894 --> 41:54.905
in a situation like that,
then you call me.

41:55.329 --> 41:57.441
Whatever time it might be.

41:57.874 --> 41:59.500
I will be there, Darryl.

42:00.835 --> 42:02.903
You hear me?

42:05.340 --> 42:06.840
We got a deal?

42:08.743 --> 42:10.179
Yeah.

42:10.203 --> 42:11.756
All right.

42:11.780 --> 42:13.557
Let's go home.
