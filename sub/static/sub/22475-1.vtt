02:34.120 --> 02:36.691
- Have they been inside for long?
- A few minutes.

02:41.427 --> 02:43.202
I got the fish.
They're in the fridge.

02:43.262 --> 02:46.334
- What color bags, honey?
- Black, two bags.

02:46.399 --> 02:49.039
- Are you coming for Shabbat?
- No, I'm going to Grandpa's.

02:49.101 --> 02:50.808
God bless. And take out
the garbage, honey.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.076
Sure.

03:08.154 --> 03:11.624
That's my son Shimi,
bless his soul.

03:11.691 --> 03:14.672
He owns a wedding hall in Jerusalem.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.707
Nothing fancy, but...

03:16.762 --> 03:17.968
the food's delicious.

03:18.030 --> 03:19.737
120 shekels a plate,

03:19.799 --> 03:22.370
bring 250 people
and he'll give you a discount.

03:22.435 --> 03:24.938
God willing.

03:25.004 --> 03:27.883
- What's your name, sweetie?
- Michal.

03:27.940 --> 03:28.941
How badly do you want to marry?

03:29.008 --> 03:31.181
- Very.
- Stop lying-

03:31.243 --> 03:33.416
Why would I lie?

03:35.948 --> 03:38.656
- Want to knead the dough?
- Sure.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.254
Come here.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.436
Knead it, with your fists.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.003
Really dig in.

03:52.031 --> 03:54.136
Harder, sweat it out.

03:54.200 --> 03:56.111
It's good for you.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.226
Enough, I think you killed the dough.

04:19.992 --> 04:21.869
It has a strong smell.

04:21.927 --> 04:26.376
That means you're full of the evil eye.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.436
How long have you been waiting?

04:29.502 --> 04:32.381
11 years.

04:32.438 --> 04:34.714
Okay, stop now.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.847
Separate it.
There are two bags there.

04:45.384 --> 04:47.864
Amen.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.763
- What now?
- Come sit down.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.795
It's all right, don't be afraid.
Everything's fine.

04:57.930 --> 05:00.103
Give me your hand.

05:04.103 --> 05:05.878
What do you want?

05:05.938 --> 05:06.939
To get married.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.781
Don't lie.

05:08.841 --> 05:11.082
- What?
- Don't be a joker.

05:19.451 --> 05:20.896
I don't want to be alone.

05:23.122 --> 05:24.760
That's not what I asked you.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.771
What are you gonna do with that fish?

05:27.827 --> 05:30.899
- Sweetheart...
- No, it really stinks.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.636
Want me to stop?

05:37.136 --> 05:39.343
No.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.953
What do you want?

05:50.382 --> 05:52.089
Love.

05:52.151 --> 05:54.222
I want love.

05:54.286 --> 05:55.924
What else?

05:55.988 --> 05:58.332
- To please God.
- Stop lying.

05:58.390 --> 05:59.425
It's not a lie.

05:59.491 --> 06:01.630
Speak freely, sweetheart.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.404
You're safe with me.

06:05.464 --> 06:08.138
What should I say?

06:08.200 --> 06:10.908
Honey, you're funny, but cut it out.

06:10.970 --> 06:14.315
If you don't tell the truth,
how can we clear the obstacles?

06:19.979 --> 06:22.550
What do you want?

06:29.188 --> 06:31.031
I want...

06:31.090 --> 06:33.832
I want to be normal.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.463
Mm-hmm.

06:35.527 --> 06:37.370
I want...

06:37.429 --> 06:38.840
to be respected.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.378
I want people to respect me
because I have a spouse.

06:41.433 --> 06:47.384
- Okay.
- I'm sick of feeling humiliated.

06:47.439 --> 06:49.885
I want to invite people over for shabbat.
I'm sick of being invited.

06:49.942 --> 06:51.944
- I get it.
- I want to make Shabbat with a man.

06:52.011 --> 06:54.958
I don't want to be alone anymore.

06:55.014 --> 06:57.995
I want someone to sing to me.

06:58.050 --> 07:01.054
- It'll happen, don't worry.
- I'm sick of being handicapped.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.897
But you're beautiful,
sweetheart, you're good.

07:04.957 --> 07:09.906
I want stability and I want to live.

07:09.962 --> 07:12.499
You're already alive.

07:12.564 --> 07:15.340
I want to give and I want to receive.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.381
I want to love and be loved back.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.040
- You will.
- That's what I want.

07:19.104 --> 07:19.980
You will.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.950
- That's it?
- Yes.

07:22.007 --> 07:24.578
Clean yourself, you're a mess.

07:24.643 --> 07:27.783
Tell Shimi I said to cut you a deal.

07:27.846 --> 07:29.655
Other side, too.

07:29.715 --> 07:32.321
Yuck.

08:00.045 --> 08:02.025
Shall we start?

08:02.081 --> 08:05.551
Let's wait till everything's served.

08:05.617 --> 08:08.223
Oh, right. Okay.

08:16.595 --> 08:18.370
Everything okay?

08:18.430 --> 08:21.172
- Everything's great.
- You sure?

08:21.233 --> 08:22.576
Totally.

08:25.270 --> 08:27.045
Good.

08:29.241 --> 08:32.381
Let's start anyway,
before it gets cold.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.597
What's going on, Gidi?

08:49.661 --> 08:51.663
Nothing.

08:51.730 --> 08:53.971
Why do I sense it isn't nothing?

08:54.033 --> 08:56.513
- You're doing it again.
- Doing what?

08:56.568 --> 08:57.569
Over-analyzing.

08:57.636 --> 09:00.207
I just want to know why you're so distant.

09:00.272 --> 09:02.445
It's called breathing.

09:02.508 --> 09:03.987
Do I suffocate you?

09:04.043 --> 09:06.182
Sometimes.

09:06.245 --> 09:09.124
I'm no fun.

09:12.384 --> 09:13.988
You haven't started yet?

09:14.053 --> 09:16.090
It'll get cold.

09:16.155 --> 09:19.602
Here's some chicken wings.

09:19.658 --> 09:21.399
And some chicken breast.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.336
Thank you.

09:22.394 --> 09:24.374
Are you on a diet?
Eat!

09:26.065 --> 09:27.510
I'll be in my office if you need anything.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.341
- Great.
- Thanks.

09:29.401 --> 09:32.211
- Bon appÃ©tit.
- Thanks.

09:34.740 --> 09:38.187
What do you want to taste first?

09:38.243 --> 09:41.019
I don't know.
What do you prefer?

09:41.080 --> 09:43.492
We could discuss that too,
if you want.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.331
Okay...

09:51.657 --> 09:54.160
Let's start with the chicken wings.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.570
All right.

10:05.804 --> 10:07.374
Amen.

10:29.161 --> 10:34.304
Come on, Gidi, what's going on?

10:34.366 --> 10:36.744
You tell me.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.247
What do you mean?

10:38.303 --> 10:40.749
It feels like you're looking for a fight.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.251
Not at all.

10:42.307 --> 10:47.416
I just wonder why
you haven't been nice all week.

10:47.479 --> 10:49.823
Where are you going with this?

10:49.882 --> 10:51.225
What do you want me to say?

10:51.283 --> 10:53.263
Nothing, I just wonder

10:53.318 --> 10:56.788
why you've been so distant
since we got engaged.

10:58.257 --> 11:00.032
It's normal.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.901
Okay, elaborate on that.

11:06.532 --> 11:11.572
I'm 36, I'm getting married
for the first and only time,

11:11.637 --> 11:16.177
so not everything is rosy
all the time, Michal.

11:16.241 --> 11:18.118
Define "not rosy."

11:19.311 --> 11:21.757
- Why?
- I really want to understand you.

11:21.813 --> 11:23.315
It's nothing,
it could only ruin things.

11:23.382 --> 11:25.328
Ruin things.

11:26.885 --> 11:28.922
It's that bad?

11:30.289 --> 11:32.200
- What do you want?
- To know what's eating you.

11:32.257 --> 11:34.533
Even if it could ruin everything?

11:34.593 --> 11:38.769
If it's that bad, wouldn't it be
better to know now?

11:41.266 --> 11:42.745
I don't want to tell you.

11:42.801 --> 11:44.781
- You have to.
- No, I don't.

11:46.238 --> 11:50.015
- You can't take it back now.
- Something's wrong with you.

11:50.075 --> 11:51.918
Please tell me.

11:55.347 --> 11:56.451
I'm begging you.

11:56.515 --> 11:58.552
I don't love you.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.759
Thank you.

12:52.738 --> 12:55.014
She doesn't want a hug now, Feigi.

12:55.073 --> 12:56.416
That's okay.

13:00.412 --> 13:02.392
Come on, it isn't...

13:03.582 --> 13:04.856
He just panicked.

13:04.916 --> 13:08.295
He'll put it aside and call to apologize.

13:08.353 --> 13:09.593
For sure.

13:09.655 --> 13:13.865
Count. 10, 9, 8, 7...

13:13.925 --> 13:16.929
You should call him.

13:16.995 --> 13:20.272
You want my life to be as
messed up as yours?

13:20.332 --> 13:22.903
Leave me out of this,
it's not the same.

13:24.603 --> 13:28.608
I promise you playing princess
isn't the right move.

13:57.469 --> 13:58.573
How are you?

13:58.637 --> 14:00.310
Did he call?

14:00.372 --> 14:03.319
I called him a thousand times.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.048
He didn't call back.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.888
Do you think I'm ugly?

14:09.948 --> 14:14.363
You're laughing? It's not funny.
I did the math.

14:14.419 --> 14:16.421
I've been dating for 10 years, right?

14:16.488 --> 14:23.428
That adds up to a 490-hour date
with 123 guys.

14:23.495 --> 14:26.772
- How long can a person date?
- Quit.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.676
What does that mean?

14:31.737 --> 14:35.412
Quit.

14:35.474 --> 14:37.613
Tell me how.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.896
Just do nothing?

15:00.699 --> 15:02.940
I feel like eating a steak.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.884
Steak.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.746
Oh, sorry.

15:21.520 --> 15:24.399
Yes, Mom?

15:24.456 --> 15:26.766
Calm down,
I can't understand you.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.502
Oh, come on...

15:31.563 --> 15:33.304
Okay, where is she?

15:33.365 --> 15:35.675
Stop hiding like a worm!

15:35.734 --> 15:37.975
Be a man and come down here, Sagâ€œ!

15:38.036 --> 15:40.073
- Lady, please stop.
- Chicken!

15:40.138 --> 15:42.379
Tum around and walk away.

15:42.441 --> 15:46.617
Fine, just tell him to be a man,
and to face me.

15:46.678 --> 15:49.215
Stop or I'll have
to bring you in.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.625
Sagi! Tell the cop
to get the hell out of here!

15:51.683 --> 15:52.684
Get into the patrol car.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.595
But he said he'd never leave me,
he swore!

15:55.654 --> 15:56.394
Honey...

15:56.455 --> 15:58.560
- Michal, tell him.
- Okay, okay.

15:58.623 --> 16:00.432
You're a loser, Sagi!

16:00.492 --> 16:01.903
Get her out of here.

16:01.960 --> 16:05.407
- You'll come back to me!
- This is my last warning!

16:05.464 --> 16:08.638
- I'm taking care of it.
- I can walk, Michal.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.008
Okay, okay-

16:10.068 --> 16:11.513
He called a cop...

16:11.570 --> 16:16.451
When you aren't screaming at him
you're begging him to stay.

16:16.508 --> 16:18.112
Michal, are you on my side?

16:18.176 --> 16:19.780
Actually, you drive me nuts.

16:21.813 --> 16:24.020
- I gotta go.
- Where?

16:24.082 --> 16:25.686
He leaves for work
in 10 minutes.

16:25.750 --> 16:27.525
You'll get arrested!

16:27.586 --> 16:29.429
He'll never press charges.

16:29.488 --> 16:30.831
How do you know?

16:30.889 --> 16:33.028
He is my husband. End of story.

16:33.091 --> 16:34.661
I know him better
than he knows himself.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.205
He needs me to need him.

16:36.261 --> 16:39.071
Fine, go to him but
no more of this drama.

16:39.130 --> 16:42.441
- I can't keep coming here.
- You don't have to. We're fine.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.037
And it'll end
when it's meant to.

16:44.102 --> 16:47.208
By the way, I think we had
a breakthrough today.

16:47.272 --> 16:48.012
What?

16:48.073 --> 16:50.485
He didn't come down
when the cop showed up.

16:50.542 --> 16:53.921
If he'd come down...
but he didn't.

16:57.983 --> 17:00.054
Call you later with an update.

17:04.589 --> 17:10.368
Who knows, my sister's so
confident maybe it'll work out.

17:10.428 --> 17:14.808
Well, men aren't fans of needy women.

17:14.866 --> 17:17.142
I gotta get ready.
What time is it?

17:17.202 --> 17:18.771
Where are you going?

17:18.837 --> 17:21.511
I'm meeting the guy
Rabbi Brand fixed me up with.

17:21.573 --> 17:24.577
- What guy?
- The guy who converted.

17:24.643 --> 17:26.486
Who are you talking about?

17:26.545 --> 17:29.617
- I don't feel like going.
- Why not?

17:29.681 --> 17:32.525
Okay, because he's Japanese.

17:32.584 --> 17:33.824
Japanese?

17:33.885 --> 17:36.729
He's a Japanese guy who converted.

17:36.788 --> 17:39.064
Cool. Sounds interesting.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.730
Yeah, right...

17:41.793 --> 17:45.104
- Say, did you give Ziv...
- Don't change the subject.

17:45.163 --> 17:47.803
- Who is he? How old?
- It doesn't matter.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.574
I can tell you right now
we have nothing in common.

17:50.635 --> 17:52.512
It's intriguing, he's from Japan.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.051
Eat sushi, do origami.

17:55.106 --> 17:57.518
You just think he's the only
guy I'm gonna get.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.578
- Why would you say that?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

17:59.644 --> 18:02.090
- Then don't.
- I'm not.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.692
I can't see myself going back.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.863
Going back where?

18:15.927 --> 18:20.569
I can't picture myself
waiting for another guy,

18:20.632 --> 18:23.442
another date, another year,
another decade.

18:29.341 --> 18:31.252
I need a change.

18:47.626 --> 18:52.575
A' Two half-souls,
we came into this world A'

19:46.184 --> 19:48.824
- What's so funny?
- Just that you sang "gloom"

19:48.887 --> 19:51.458
instead of "groom" so I wondered
if you're getting

19:51.523 --> 19:54.333
- married or divorced.
- I'm already married.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.097
- Sorry.
- Sorry for what?

19:59.698 --> 20:00.904
I don't know.

20:00.965 --> 20:02.239
What don't you know?

20:02.300 --> 20:05.008
I don't know, I just thought

20:05.070 --> 20:08.813
you looked single.
I don't know why...

20:08.873 --> 20:11.513
I don't know why I thought
you weren't married.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.156
You okay?

20:15.780 --> 20:17.691
Yes, thank God.

20:17.749 --> 20:19.126
You sure?

20:21.052 --> 20:22.929
Of course, I'm getting married.

20:25.423 --> 20:26.834
Okay-

20:28.727 --> 20:32.766
- Can I help you with something?
- Yes. How much

20:32.831 --> 20:36.210
will it cost us to reserve
the hall for 200 guests?

20:38.369 --> 20:40.110
Is this some kind of joke?

20:40.171 --> 20:41.775
Why a joke?

20:45.009 --> 20:48.684
You aren't marrying Gidi.
Right?

20:48.747 --> 20:50.727
Uh...no.

20:50.782 --> 20:55.026
I guess not.
Gidi isn't the groom.

20:55.086 --> 20:56.759
Is there another groom?

20:56.821 --> 20:57.856
Of course.

20:57.922 --> 21:00.801
That's why I want to reserve the hall.

21:00.859 --> 21:04.466
Your mom said you'd give me
a good price for over 250 guests

21:04.529 --> 21:07.840
but I want a good price for 200,
including a buffet.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.470
- Okay.
- How much?

21:10.535 --> 21:11.946
8th night of Hanukkah?

21:12.003 --> 21:13.880
Yes, 22 days from now.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.083
How much?

21:23.882 --> 21:25.589
15,000 shekels will do.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.069
You're a character, Michal.

21:42.133 --> 21:44.773
So I am.

21:44.836 --> 21:47.282
I just hope you're not going crazy on me.

21:49.874 --> 21:53.754
- I'm not crazy.
- Really?

21:53.812 --> 21:56.793
I'm getting married,
on the 8th night of Hanukkah.

21:56.848 --> 21:58.589
But who's the groom?

22:01.119 --> 22:02.757
I have a hall.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.459
I have a dress.

22:04.522 --> 22:06.126
The apartment is almost ready.

22:06.191 --> 22:09.832
By the end of Hanukkah.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.106
Marta, you hear that?

22:13.164 --> 22:16.771
Michal's getting married and she
doesn't have a groom yet.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.473
- Feigi.
- What do you mean?

22:18.536 --> 22:20.311
Let's hear what she thinks.

22:20.371 --> 22:22.044
You can't get married without a groom.

22:22.106 --> 22:23.847
There will be one.

22:25.577 --> 22:28.251
I don't understand.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.452
Marta, don't you believe
God can find me a groom

22:30.515 --> 22:33.121
by the end of Hanukkah?

22:34.352 --> 22:35.797
He can.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.095
- But maybe He doesn't want to?
- Why?

22:38.156 --> 22:40.158
- It doesn't work like that.
- How do you know?

22:40.225 --> 22:41.761
- Come on...
- I believe that if

22:41.826 --> 22:45.672
I'm 100% sure that God will find me one.

22:45.730 --> 22:47.266
He will.

22:47.332 --> 22:48.572
Why?

22:48.633 --> 22:50.135
No offense,
but who do you think you are?

22:51.569 --> 22:53.640
The Talmud says,
"The world was created for me."

22:55.974 --> 22:59.114
- Well, lucky you.
- But why does that bother you?

22:59.177 --> 23:02.215
You need to take it down a notch
and lose the arrogance, okay?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.886
Or God won't give me what I want?

23:04.949 --> 23:07.896
- It's possible.
- Why?

23:07.952 --> 23:08.987
Maybe it's not what you need.

23:09.053 --> 23:11.090
If it is, will He give it to me?

23:11.155 --> 23:13.533
- I don't know.
- Why, is He cruel?

23:13.591 --> 23:14.729
No.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.203
But we can't understand God's ways.

23:16.261 --> 23:18.036
- Is He good?
- Of course.

23:18.096 --> 23:20.201
Then if it's good for me
He'll give it to me.

23:21.332 --> 23:22.538
How should I know?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.307
What's wrong with me getting married?

23:26.371 --> 23:28.282
- I don't know.
- It's only good.

23:28.339 --> 23:29.613
Only good.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.517
There is nothing good in being alone

23:31.576 --> 23:34.284
and I'm sure of it
and nothing's going to stop me.

23:34.345 --> 23:36.621
I just need to find the courage.

23:36.681 --> 23:38.683
It's the only thing I lack.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.427
I'm so nervous I'm gonna faint.

23:48.493 --> 23:50.598
You won't faint.

23:58.336 --> 24:02.443
MICHAL'S PETTING ZOO

24:08.012 --> 24:10.390
Okay, pick a number between
one and five.

24:10.448 --> 24:12.928
- Two.
- Two, very good.

24:12.984 --> 24:14.554
We're calling two matchmakers
right now.

24:14.619 --> 24:16.963
Let's call Fried and Zeidman.

24:17.021 --> 24:19.968
- How about Fried and Klapholtz.
- Okay.

24:41.446 --> 24:44.222
Forgive me.

24:44.282 --> 24:45.693
L don't forgive you.

25:06.037 --> 25:08.574
Wow, you have such a beautiful laugh.

25:14.445 --> 25:16.482
You have a beautiful laugh.

25:21.352 --> 25:22.854
Thank you.

25:26.457 --> 25:28.403
Michal...

25:32.096 --> 25:34.474
Will you marry me?

25:43.174 --> 25:44.653
Wow.

25:49.514 --> 25:52.427
I feel like I've found what I lost.

25:59.724 --> 26:00.964
What?

26:06.164 --> 26:09.111
You know nothing about me.

26:09.167 --> 26:11.044
What's there to know?

26:13.237 --> 26:17.083
You know,
something simple like...

26:17.141 --> 26:18.518
what do I look like?

26:18.576 --> 26:22.046
We've been here for two hours
and you haven't looked at me once.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.753
I have a whole lifetime to look at you.

26:24.816 --> 26:26.727
Only at you.

26:29.153 --> 26:32.760
Tell me more about this trick.

26:35.393 --> 26:38.033
If I never look at another woman,

26:38.096 --> 26:41.703
my wife becomes the most
beautiful woman in the world.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.337
That's my gift to her.

26:49.774 --> 26:52.084
Ronen, listen.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.817
Let's make a deal.

26:56.647 --> 26:59.127
I'm listening.

26:59.183 --> 27:03.689
Since I just met someone
crazier than me,

27:03.754 --> 27:07.429
which is a first for me...

27:07.492 --> 27:10.063
I'm with you.

27:10.128 --> 27:13.473
I promise that if you look at me,

27:13.531 --> 27:16.671
I will marry you.

27:28.179 --> 27:29.749
Are you serious?

27:29.814 --> 27:32.021
Totally.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.457
You're just saying that so I'll look.

27:35.520 --> 27:36.521
No, no.

27:36.587 --> 27:39.761
Not at all.

27:39.824 --> 27:40.734
No.

27:40.791 --> 27:42.793
- No way.
- Oh yes.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.703
Oh, yes, and if you don't mind,

27:44.762 --> 27:47.709
we're getting married
on the 8th night of Hanukkah.

28:01.012 --> 28:07.429
I have a feeling this is a test for me.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.795
No, that's not it.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.767
That's not it.
That's not it.

28:12.823 --> 28:14.393
This is really cruel of you.

28:14.458 --> 28:18.235
No, what makes you say that?
That's not it.

28:21.132 --> 28:23.009
I get it from your energy.

28:23.067 --> 28:25.604
My energy is following yours.

28:26.938 --> 28:29.282
You can't force me.

28:29.340 --> 28:31.752
You think I'm trying
to force you to marry me?

28:31.809 --> 28:33.083
Maybe not force me,

28:33.144 --> 28:35.215
but you want me to look at you
so you can mess with my head.

28:35.279 --> 28:37.452
Nobody's ever tried to make
that deal before.

28:39.550 --> 28:43.555
You've proposed like this before?

28:43.621 --> 28:45.225
I always propose.

28:47.225 --> 28:49.671
What?

28:49.727 --> 28:52.571
You come across like a sane person.

28:52.630 --> 28:55.873
I believe that God will only
let me marry the right one,

28:55.933 --> 28:58.345
so I tell all the girls
they're amazing

28:58.402 --> 29:00.609
and the one who really wants me
will say yes.

29:00.671 --> 29:03.982
No conditions, no driving me crazy...

29:04.041 --> 29:06.214
Thank you.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.689
Your words are very powerful...

29:17.521 --> 29:21.298
- I don't think it's working.
- Yes, you're right.

29:21.359 --> 29:23.965
Maybe you should take out the snake?

29:24.028 --> 29:26.907
I'm afraid it'll scare them.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.304
Want to see the snake?

29:30.368 --> 29:31.904
Yes!

29:31.969 --> 29:33.312
Okay-

29:36.407 --> 29:38.580
Meet...

29:38.643 --> 29:40.714
Avi.

29:40.778 --> 29:42.883
Avi is a snake,

29:42.947 --> 29:45.257
a Hack combat.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.387
He isn't dangerous to humans at all,

29:47.451 --> 29:49.362
he actually helps farmers

29:49.420 --> 29:53.425
- by eating lizards and mice.
- Ew!

29:53.491 --> 29:58.270
But I buy him chicken
at the supermarket

29:58.329 --> 30:03.005
and only sometimes
I give him a mouse or a lizard.

30:05.002 --> 30:08.006
Where do you get mice?

30:08.072 --> 30:10.416
- I just get them.
- That's so gross.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.316
Girls, who's brave enough to pet Avi?

30:14.378 --> 30:16.654
No.

30:16.714 --> 30:20.059
I'm sure there's one girl here

30:20.117 --> 30:22.290
who's brave enough to pet Avi.

30:22.353 --> 30:25.095
- No.
- You.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.999
- What's your name, brave girl?
- Sarah.

30:27.058 --> 30:30.505
- Sarah. Will you pet Avi?
- Yes.

30:30.561 --> 30:31.733
I'd actually rather she didn't.

30:31.796 --> 30:33.070
Why not? She wants to.

30:33.130 --> 30:33.938
- I'd just rather she didn't.
- Why?

30:33.998 --> 30:35.272
Too disgusting.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.142
But that's why
you asked me here.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.574
Let's let Sarah pet Avi.

30:43.607 --> 30:46.087
No, I don't think so.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.319
Do you know
what that thing eats?

30:50.381 --> 30:52.520
It's gross!

31:04.161 --> 31:05.469
Thank you.

31:05.529 --> 31:07.406
I think they ended up enjoying it.

31:07.465 --> 31:09.706
- We enjoy being frightened.
- Apparently.

31:12.470 --> 31:14.814
Can I ask you
a personal question?

31:14.872 --> 31:17.045
Sure, why not?

31:17.108 --> 31:19.452
Doesn't it make it hard to find a match?

31:19.510 --> 31:23.356
A delicate woman with mice and snakes.

31:23.414 --> 31:24.950
Maybe I'm not so delicate.

31:25.015 --> 31:26.619
So my mate isn't looking
for a delicate wife.

31:26.684 --> 31:29.722
All men want a delicate wife.

31:29.787 --> 31:32.393
Let me take this, okay?

31:36.026 --> 31:39.405
Hello, Mrs. Fried, how are you?

31:39.463 --> 31:42.273
Good, thank God.

31:45.836 --> 31:48.077
But, Mrs. Fried, we've already
discussed that option.

31:51.041 --> 31:55.547
Okay, but how are we
supposed to communicate?

32:02.820 --> 32:05.130
L realize this is strange.

32:05.189 --> 32:06.930
How are you handling it?

32:09.994 --> 32:11.974
I'm used to strange.

32:13.798 --> 32:15.402
What do you do for a living?

32:15.466 --> 32:19.380
Mrs. Fried was a bit vague about that.

32:21.172 --> 32:24.745
I have a mobile petting zoo.

32:28.879 --> 32:31.985
Wow, that's unusual.

32:36.086 --> 32:39.260
But I'm considering changing jobs.

32:39.323 --> 32:40.893
Why?

32:40.958 --> 32:43.438
Because I have...

32:43.494 --> 32:49.035
I had a snake that eats mice

32:49.099 --> 32:53.514
and someone suggested that
it wasn't very appealing

32:53.571 --> 32:57.713
that I fed Avi mice,
although I usually gave him chicken

32:57.775 --> 33:00.517
that I bought at the supermarket.

33:07.985 --> 33:09.589
Tell me the truth,

33:09.653 --> 33:12.463
do you want me
to find that unappealing?

33:13.958 --> 33:16.438
Why, do you find it appealing?

33:16.494 --> 33:18.405
Very.

33:18.462 --> 33:20.305
Don't change jobs.

33:32.443 --> 33:36.892
Mrs. Fried told me he's...
you're a psychologist.

33:37.915 --> 33:39.553
I treat deaf people.

33:39.617 --> 33:40.994
Amazing.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.863
Very quiet...

33:49.593 --> 33:51.539
Why did you agree to meet me now?

33:51.595 --> 33:54.201
I know you were offered a
meeting with me a year ago

33:54.265 --> 33:57.644
and you refused to meet him...
Me.

34:02.039 --> 34:05.646
Because I thought it was...

34:05.709 --> 34:07.620
too complicated.

34:14.418 --> 34:16.830
So why now?

34:20.157 --> 34:21.931
Should I tell the truth?

34:21.992 --> 34:23.630
Only the truth.

34:26.397 --> 34:28.502
Despair.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.860
What?

35:04.368 --> 35:06.541
What's wrong?
Why do you act this way?

35:07.671 --> 35:10.379
Whatever you need, I'll give you.

35:10.441 --> 35:14.480
If can, gladly, with all my heart.

35:14.545 --> 35:16.616
What?

35:16.680 --> 35:20.287
- Truce, Mom. I'm tired.
- Okay.

35:20.351 --> 35:22.456
Just stop this madness.

35:26.123 --> 35:29.696
Rabbi, perhaps you could explain
it so she'll understand.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.535
Michal, did you understand what I said?

35:31.595 --> 35:33.575
Yes, I think so.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.372
The Rabbi's not sure it's the Jewish way

35:35.432 --> 35:38.072
and it's not the way of our community.

35:38.135 --> 35:40.979
What you're doing is called
"counting on miracles."

35:41.038 --> 35:42.813
It's not a question of our community,

35:42.873 --> 35:44.819
even saints wouldn't expect such things.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.355
Who gave you the right?

35:47.411 --> 35:49.049
Do you really want an answer, Rabbi?

35:49.113 --> 35:50.956
- Yes.
- Go on.

35:54.952 --> 35:57.592
I'm not demanding anything of God.

35:57.655 --> 36:01.501
I only demand from myself
the courage to believe His plan.

36:01.558 --> 36:04.129
As a rabbi, you understand
the nuance, right?

36:04.194 --> 36:06.834
And I'm not obsessed
with getting married,

36:06.897 --> 36:09.503
but I want this drama to be over,

36:09.566 --> 36:12.809
and for this story to have
a happy ending.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.077
My wedding plan
is like a karate chop,

36:15.139 --> 36:17.676
if I focus 100%,
I'll break through the wall.

36:17.741 --> 36:21.314
At 99% I'll break my hand.

36:21.378 --> 36:23.517
Just one thing.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.617
If you don't get married on Hanukkah,

36:25.683 --> 36:28.596
what'll happen to your faith?

36:28.652 --> 36:29.824
How much is this costing you?

36:29.887 --> 36:31.764
- Does it matter, Mom?
- Is something wrong?

36:31.822 --> 36:33.233
Michali's getting married.

36:33.290 --> 36:35.327
Still with the marriage nonsense?

36:35.392 --> 36:37.394
Excuse me, Rabbi.

36:37.461 --> 36:39.941
- I'm calling Gidi.
- Why?

36:39.997 --> 36:42.307
He should know what's going on
and take some responsibility.

36:42.366 --> 36:43.902
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Yes it does.

36:43.967 --> 36:45.207
It has nothing to do
with Michal's madness.

36:45.269 --> 36:47.943
Sure it does.

36:48.005 --> 36:51.145
It's driving me nuts.

36:51.208 --> 36:54.621
Rabbi, Noam was my
problem daughter, but Michali?

36:54.678 --> 36:56.954
If she weren't so religious,
she'd be nearly perfect.

36:58.082 --> 36:59.823
This makes no sense.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.657
What is she even talking about?

37:06.090 --> 37:07.728
Michal.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.570
As soon as your flight lands

37:11.628 --> 37:14.507
- say a prayer for me and Sagi.
- Okay, sis.

37:14.565 --> 37:15.873
Pray that he has a change of heart.

37:15.933 --> 37:18.140
Rabbi Nachman will be pleased

37:18.202 --> 37:19.203
that even my sister is getting religious.

37:19.269 --> 37:20.247
Not quite.

37:25.242 --> 37:30.920
Ladies and gentlemen we are
beginning our final descent.

37:30.981 --> 37:36.397
We wish you a pleasant stay in Ukraine.

38:10.921 --> 38:14.198
UMAN, UKRAINE

38:22.566 --> 38:24.568
- Bye.
- Where are you headed, Michal?

38:24.635 --> 38:27.639
- I am going now to the tomb.
- Where are you staying?

38:27.704 --> 38:29.445
I don't plan to sleep.

38:29.506 --> 38:33.454
THIS WAY
TO RABBI NACHMAN'S TOMB

39:49.052 --> 39:51.396
I'm a liar.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.834
A liar.

39:59.429 --> 40:02.410
I can't feel you.

40:02.466 --> 40:04.639
I don't feel anything.

40:08.639 --> 40:11.245
Where are you?

40:33.030 --> 40:35.601
Why did you create me this way?

40:35.666 --> 40:38.875
Everyone feels you.

40:38.936 --> 40:41.883
I don't feel you at all.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.919
I'm a liar.

40:43.974 --> 40:45.578
Hey...

40:45.642 --> 40:47.713
I'm a liar.

40:48.879 --> 40:50.324
Hey...

40:52.249 --> 40:54.752
Just give me a sign that you're okay.

40:58.021 --> 41:00.695
Who's there?

41:00.757 --> 41:01.997
The tomb is half on the men's side

41:02.059 --> 41:03.902
and half on the w omen's side.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.134
What?

41:06.196 --> 41:08.699
Who are you looking for'?

41:10.701 --> 41:13.511
- What?
- Who are you looking for?

41:13.570 --> 41:15.277
Who's looking?

41:15.339 --> 41:17.148
It sounds like
you're really missing someone.

41:20.510 --> 41:23.081
As if it's hard for you to let go.

41:23.146 --> 41:26.127
It's too much for me.
I'm sorry.

41:26.183 --> 41:27.992
Aka)'-

41:30.020 --> 41:31.795
What's your name?

41:33.523 --> 41:35.264
I'm tired.

41:35.325 --> 41:38.329
Forgive me. I'm too tired.
I'm leaving.

41:38.395 --> 41:40.671
Just go with the flow.

41:40.731 --> 41:43.405
The flow to where?

41:43.467 --> 41:46.038
Rabbi Nachman watches over us,
honey.

41:48.605 --> 41:51.711
Hey, what's your name?

41:57.514 --> 42:00.256
I'm starving.

42:00.317 --> 42:02.388
What's your name?

42:06.189 --> 42:08.669
Michal.

42:08.725 --> 42:11.331
Bon appÃ©tit, Michal.

42:26.610 --> 42:29.352
Michal?

42:29.413 --> 42:31.654
You're Michal, right?

42:36.653 --> 42:38.826
It's been a long time
since I heard someone

42:38.889 --> 42:40.368
call themselves a liar.

42:42.159 --> 42:45.231
Excuse me, are you Yoss
or am I a total wacko?

42:46.596 --> 42:49.270
You aren't a wacko.

42:49.332 --> 42:51.471
But why are you a liar?

42:53.336 --> 42:56.476
I was really touched by what you said.

42:56.540 --> 42:59.851
- Really?
- Yeah, it was like...

42:59.910 --> 43:03.380
- It had a kind of groove.
- Define "groove."

43:03.447 --> 43:05.427
Define "groove"?

43:07.451 --> 43:09.453
I don't really know.

43:09.519 --> 43:12.557
I was too touched to analyze it.

43:12.622 --> 43:15.296
What touched you?

43:15.358 --> 43:17.668
You did.

43:17.727 --> 43:20.765
- Me?
- You.

43:23.733 --> 43:26.043
You were honest.

43:27.037 --> 43:30.416
Honesty is the real deal.

43:30.474 --> 43:32.476
Yoss, do you know what you're doing?

43:32.542 --> 43:34.385
What am I doing?

43:34.444 --> 43:36.685
You're healing me.

43:39.049 --> 43:40.494
Wow.

43:40.550 --> 43:42.325
Totally wow.

43:48.425 --> 43:49.836
Let's go for a walk.

43:49.893 --> 43:53.363
I'm meeting my friends
at the car in 5 minutes.

43:53.430 --> 43:57.173
- What are you doing in Ukraine?
- We had a gig in Kiev

43:57.234 --> 43:59.145
and Yoni decided that we have to visit

43:59.202 --> 44:00.738
the famous Rabbi Nachman.

44:03.173 --> 44:05.813
- Coming?
- I don't know.

44:05.876 --> 44:09.483
Pretend we're at your house
and you're walking me to my car.

44:09.546 --> 44:10.616
Hm?

44:13.116 --> 44:14.595
All right.

44:14.651 --> 44:16.528
Let's go.

44:20.223 --> 44:22.362
So what made you so unwell?

44:25.162 --> 44:27.369
I'm healed.

44:27.430 --> 44:29.000
Don't you remember?

44:31.434 --> 44:34.415
- If only it worked that way.
- If what did?

44:34.471 --> 44:36.610
A few words and the soul is healed.

44:36.673 --> 44:38.550
It does work that way.

44:46.816 --> 44:48.887
Where do you live?

44:48.952 --> 44:51.057
- Jerusalem.
- Address?

44:52.789 --> 44:54.632
- Why?
- What's your address?

44:57.294 --> 45:00.138
4 Arnon St.

45:00.197 --> 45:01.870
Why?

45:01.932 --> 45:04.435
So you don't disappear on me.

45:13.410 --> 45:15.651
I won't disappear.

45:20.083 --> 45:21.687
Okay-

45:28.458 --> 45:31.302
Want to hear a secret?

45:31.361 --> 45:33.671
Sure do.

45:35.665 --> 45:38.145
12 days from now,

45:38.201 --> 45:41.876
the 8th night of Hanukkah,
I'm getting married.

45:41.938 --> 45:45.476
With the man of my dreams

45:45.542 --> 45:48.182
whom I have yet to meet.

45:53.283 --> 45:54.853
Are you on something?

45:54.918 --> 45:57.558
- What do you mean?
- Are you high?

45:57.621 --> 46:00.500
- You mean if I'm on drugs?
- You sound like it.

46:00.557 --> 46:02.002
I don't know
about being a druggie.

46:02.058 --> 46:04.368
"Druggie"?

46:05.328 --> 46:07.808
Not really, no.

46:07.864 --> 46:10.435
Good for you.

46:12.202 --> 46:14.978
You're getting married
but you have no groom?

46:17.407 --> 46:20.616
It's much simpler than you think.

46:20.677 --> 46:22.782
I just believe,

46:22.846 --> 46:27.591
sweetly and gently, that in
the next 12 days I'm going to...

46:27.651 --> 46:32.725
meet...the love of my life,

46:32.789 --> 46:34.564
my best friend,

46:34.624 --> 46:37.366
my husband
and the father of my children.

46:38.962 --> 46:41.943
And if you don't meet him?

46:41.998 --> 46:44.342
But I will and there will be a wedding.

46:44.401 --> 46:46.039
You're really...

46:48.405 --> 46:49.907
Will there be guests?

46:49.973 --> 46:51.111
Or aren't you inviting anyone?

46:51.174 --> 46:53.051
Of course I am.

46:53.109 --> 46:54.986
I've invited 200 people.

46:55.045 --> 46:56.956
You're invited, too, by the way.

46:57.013 --> 47:01.962
Imagine how our kids will react
when we will tell them.

47:06.790 --> 47:09.270
Did you think I meant "our" kids?

47:09.326 --> 47:10.828
- Didn't you?
- No, no.

47:10.894 --> 47:12.430
Not at all. Sorry.

47:12.495 --> 47:14.668
I meant me and my husband's kids
when they hear

47:14.731 --> 47:16.768
that our friend the pop star
was at the wedding.

47:16.833 --> 47:18.904
That's all.

47:18.968 --> 47:20.845
You got scared.

47:20.904 --> 47:22.747
Yeah.

47:22.806 --> 47:25.844
Is it that scary to marry me?

47:29.446 --> 47:31.687
No.

47:31.748 --> 47:34.388
NO, fight?

47:37.420 --> 47:40.401
- Your friends.
- My friends.

47:44.627 --> 47:46.937
Will you marry
anyone who's willing?

47:48.531 --> 47:50.408
No, this isn't like hunting season.

47:51.801 --> 47:55.806
But finding the love of your
life 12 days before Hanukkah,

47:55.872 --> 47:58.876
is no more a miracle
than finding him at all.

47:58.942 --> 48:01.354
It's not about who will be "willing,"

48:01.411 --> 48:03.448
it's about the one man

48:03.513 --> 48:07.086
who wants this like I do

48:07.150 --> 48:10.529
and he'll be mine
and he'll be the one for me.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.701
Michal, you're a real surprise.

48:20.263 --> 48:23.506
I wish you well, Yoss.

48:23.566 --> 48:25.375
And I wish you well, too.

48:26.569 --> 48:28.105
Take care.

48:29.739 --> 48:31.685
Take care, Michal.

48:59.269 --> 49:01.749
I listen to him all the time,
I have his CD.

49:01.805 --> 49:04.012
I have ALL his CDs.

49:04.073 --> 49:08.385
- I know, it's unreal.
- So how did it end?

49:08.445 --> 49:11.255
My heart broke, that's how.

49:11.314 --> 49:13.555
Can you believe it?

49:15.718 --> 49:19.666
Look, you've had a crazy experience.

49:19.722 --> 49:21.030
You're not thinking straight.

49:21.090 --> 49:23.798
No, you don't get it, it was...

49:23.860 --> 49:26.568
it was brief, but it was so honest

49:26.629 --> 49:29.872
and so intense, whoa!

49:35.238 --> 49:38.185
- Don't lose your head.
- No.

49:38.241 --> 49:40.847
God will watch out for me.

49:40.910 --> 49:42.890
Try this song instead.

49:42.946 --> 49:44.289
It's a little long.

49:46.549 --> 49:48.358
Hello, Mrs. Klapholtz.

49:48.418 --> 49:49.761
- Michal?
- Yes.

49:49.819 --> 49:51.662
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you.

49:51.721 --> 49:52.995
I was out of the country for a night.

49:53.056 --> 49:55.627
- I just got back.
- Fine, you went away

49:55.692 --> 49:57.569
but I'm still here working hard for you.

49:57.627 --> 49:59.732
Not because I feel guilty about Gidi,

49:59.796 --> 50:00.831
but! want to find someone soon.

50:00.897 --> 50:02.774
I'm sorry.

50:02.832 --> 50:03.867
No need to apologize.
It's actually for the best.

50:03.933 --> 50:06.106
Anyway,
I have a great guy for you.

50:06.169 --> 50:07.113
You listening?

50:07.170 --> 50:09.980
- Yes.
- His name is Assaf Stern,

50:10.039 --> 50:13.077
he's 35, religious for three
years, road engineer,

50:13.142 --> 50:17.022
studies, works, a Breslov Hasid
like you wanted,

50:17.080 --> 50:21.119
studies with Rabbi Schechter.
He's a real catch.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.219
When can you meet him?

50:23.386 --> 50:24.729
Today.

50:24.787 --> 50:27.097
It's short notice, but I'll try.

50:27.156 --> 50:30.603
- I'll get back to you.
- Great, thanks.

50:39.469 --> 50:42.643
You said I could pay half now
and the rest after the wedding.

50:42.705 --> 50:44.480
I have great respect for you,
please don't ruin that.

50:44.541 --> 50:45.212
You don't believe this is happening.

50:45.275 --> 50:46.049
No.

50:46.109 --> 50:48.487
Well that's a shock.

50:48.545 --> 50:49.182
Why?

50:49.245 --> 50:52.158
I was sure you'd be understanding.

50:52.215 --> 50:55.526
What are you trying to prove,
Michal?

50:55.585 --> 50:57.462
Shimi, don't upset me right now.

50:59.155 --> 51:01.226
Gidi.

51:01.291 --> 51:03.828
Ziv told me you're here.

51:03.893 --> 51:06.499
What are you doing here?

51:06.563 --> 51:08.804
What am I doing here, Michal?

51:10.166 --> 51:13.443
- Tell me.
- You tell me.

51:13.503 --> 51:15.710
No, I want to hear it from you.

51:21.678 --> 51:23.715
I can't.

51:23.780 --> 51:27.023
Yes, you can. Tell me.
Please tell me.

51:29.385 --> 51:32.389
I'll tell Shimi
and he'll tell you.

51:41.431 --> 51:43.069
Tell her.

51:45.435 --> 51:46.914
No, don't tell.

51:46.970 --> 51:48.540
Tell her.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.176
No, no, don't tell me.

51:51.240 --> 51:52.548
Tell her.

51:52.609 --> 51:54.714
- Shimi, don't tell me.
- Tell her.

51:54.777 --> 51:56.814
- No, don't tell me.
- Tell her.

51:56.879 --> 51:58.984
No!

53:20.730 --> 53:23.404
Sorry.

53:23.466 --> 53:28.108
How long after the wedding
can I start entertaining?

53:29.639 --> 53:31.949
- Listen, there's a problem.
- What's up?

53:32.008 --> 53:34.818
Sit down a second.

53:34.877 --> 53:37.756
- You're worrying me.
- You have to sit down, okay?

53:42.118 --> 53:42.892
Speak LIP-

53:42.952 --> 53:44.659
Gidi and Ziva are getting married.

53:46.022 --> 53:47.433
Who's Ziva?

53:49.726 --> 53:51.262
- Speak up.
- Gidi the jerk

53:51.327 --> 53:55.139
and Ziva the doctor.

53:55.198 --> 53:57.508
As in Ziv my roommate?

53:57.567 --> 53:59.672
It began when she called to
convince him to take you back.

54:02.672 --> 54:04.379
Is this some kind of joke?

54:04.440 --> 54:06.283
I'm dead serious.

54:09.946 --> 54:11.584
It's only been two weeks.

54:14.317 --> 54:15.762
Come in.

54:22.825 --> 54:24.361
My poor sweetheart.

54:24.427 --> 54:26.373
How long have you known?

54:26.429 --> 54:28.375
We just found out.

54:29.832 --> 54:32.278
What I wouldn't do to that witch-

54:32.335 --> 54:33.336
Enough, Mom.

54:33.402 --> 54:36.246
- To both of them.
- Where is she?

54:36.305 --> 54:40.685
What do you need, Michal?

54:42.879 --> 54:44.153
ZN'?

54:47.183 --> 54:48.992
Ziv!

54:49.051 --> 54:50.052
Ziv, open the door.

54:53.122 --> 54:57.764
Open the door,
you can't run away.

54:57.827 --> 55:01.604
- Ziv, open up!
- Calm down first.

55:01.664 --> 55:03.405
You calm down!

55:03.466 --> 55:06.743
Shame on you!

55:06.803 --> 55:07.907
I'm not coming out.

55:07.970 --> 55:09.449
Oh yes, you are!

55:09.505 --> 55:11.075
Either way, lady,

55:11.140 --> 55:14.144
- you're opening this door!
- Stop it, Michali.

55:14.210 --> 55:16.349
Why? I just want to talk!

55:16.412 --> 55:19.723
- It doesn't seem that way.
- I'm not coming out.

55:19.782 --> 55:23.127
Open up, I'm gonna lose it.

55:23.186 --> 55:24.824
- You hear me?
- Michal, you're out of line.

55:24.887 --> 55:28.096
I'm out of line?!
Shame on you!

55:28.157 --> 55:29.693
You, of all people?!

55:29.759 --> 55:31.329
Ziv, I want to talk!

55:31.394 --> 55:32.998
Whoa!

55:33.062 --> 55:35.133
L don't know why it broke.

55:35.198 --> 55:37.872
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

55:37.934 --> 55:40.107
Go away. Not now.

55:40.169 --> 55:41.910
- Just take her away.
- No way.

55:41.971 --> 55:45.282
You don't get to be the star of
this show, do you hear me?

55:45.341 --> 55:49.790
- You have no right.
- Michal, relax.

55:49.846 --> 55:51.450
Stop it!

55:51.514 --> 55:55.087
Stop.

56:04.060 --> 56:07.803
So, Assaf, what are you
looking for in a woman?

56:07.864 --> 56:09.172
The complete opposite of you.

56:09.232 --> 56:11.769
- Pardon me?
- Someone just like you.

56:11.834 --> 56:15.145
- I don't get it.
- How am I supposed to answer?

56:16.572 --> 56:18.313
Good answer.

56:22.945 --> 56:24.288
Where did you drift off to?

56:24.347 --> 56:26.987
As if you care.

56:27.049 --> 56:28.426
I don't care.

56:30.653 --> 56:33.099
- Thank you.
- For what?

56:33.155 --> 56:35.692
For being honest.

56:35.758 --> 56:37.237
It's thanks to you.

56:37.293 --> 56:42.072
- What do you mean?
- You have this nutty energy.

56:42.131 --> 56:44.407
- Nutty?
- Nutty,

56:47.403 --> 56:49.405
Why did you just go pale?

56:49.472 --> 56:51.418
Are you some kind of actor?

56:51.474 --> 56:52.418
You recognize me.

56:52.475 --> 56:55.945
- I didn't mean a real actor...
- Took you a while.

56:56.012 --> 56:57.889
Was I supposed to recognize you?

56:57.947 --> 56:59.722
- I'm a star.
- A star?

56:59.782 --> 57:01.591
I thought you recognized me.

57:03.019 --> 57:05.966
No. What's going on here?

57:10.326 --> 57:12.670
Not even my mom thinks I'm a star.

57:14.497 --> 57:17.000
Then what are you?

57:20.002 --> 57:21.572
An observant Jew.

57:23.105 --> 57:26.245
God's servant.

57:26.309 --> 57:28.289
Simple as that?

57:28.344 --> 57:30.324
Simple as that.

57:38.988 --> 57:40.433
So why did you go pale?

57:40.489 --> 57:42.594
I can't believe you're asking that again.

57:42.658 --> 57:44.069
Then why don't you answer'?

57:44.126 --> 57:46.470
- Why am I pale?
- Yes.

57:46.529 --> 57:49.999
- Let me think about it.
- Take your time.

57:51.968 --> 57:55.415
I think I'm pale because...

57:57.406 --> 57:59.443
My ship sank.

58:01.444 --> 58:05.586
And because I'm all alone now

58:05.648 --> 58:07.559
out at sea.

58:13.823 --> 58:15.769
I'm out of breath,

58:15.825 --> 58:17.827
I'm tired,

58:17.893 --> 58:19.634
I'm exhausted.

58:33.542 --> 58:35.749
I'll survive.

58:35.811 --> 58:37.916
What about you, Assaf?

58:37.980 --> 58:41.086
Why are you so pale?

58:41.150 --> 58:42.754
I'm not.

58:42.818 --> 58:45.389
We're all pale.

58:45.454 --> 58:47.661
Tell me, what's your paleness?

58:47.723 --> 58:49.828
Don't want to be alone out there,
huh?

58:49.892 --> 58:52.930
No.

58:52.995 --> 58:56.067
- Sorry.
- No, it's not fair.

58:56.132 --> 58:58.669
- It's all right.
- No it isn't.

58:58.734 --> 59:00.645
- You'll live.
- Not necessarily.

59:02.071 --> 59:04.142
There's no time.

59:04.206 --> 59:07.312
That's what I'm saying, there's no time.

59:07.376 --> 59:10.016
It's true, I'm alone

59:10.079 --> 59:11.820
out at sea,

59:11.881 --> 59:13.485
clinging to a board or whatever,

59:13.549 --> 59:17.429
then I look to the right and see...

59:17.486 --> 59:19.625
Assaf, you're here too.

59:19.688 --> 59:23.033
Just like me, adrift at sea

59:23.092 --> 59:25.504
and I don't have the strength to swim,

59:25.561 --> 59:27.700
but you do.

59:27.763 --> 59:30.039
Then you say to me,

59:30.099 --> 59:32.443
"Michali, follow me."

59:33.436 --> 59:36.713
And I swim behind you
and I find the strength.

59:36.772 --> 59:40.185
We swim and swim and we reach

59:40.242 --> 59:42.882
a beautiful island

59:42.945 --> 59:44.652
and it's deserted.

59:44.713 --> 59:48.991
- And no one can rescue us.
- How do you know?

59:49.051 --> 59:51.258
Because I'm the one
telling this story.

59:52.421 --> 59:54.799
We reach the island and we're alone,

59:54.857 --> 59:57.895
not a living soul, and we can't leave.

59:59.428 --> 01:00:02.375
You and I on a desert island forever.

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:04.934
Do we get along?

01:00:09.271 --> 01:00:12.013
"Getting along" isn't enough.

01:00:12.074 --> 01:00:15.487
I think if we were together
on a desert island

01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:17.990
we'd become the best of friends.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:21.085
That's what I call true love,
and you'd become

01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:23.187
the most important thing in my life.

01:00:38.267 --> 01:00:40.440
What do you want?

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.779
To brush my teeth.
It can wait.

01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:44.840
It's okay, come in.

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:57.620
You look nice.

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:03.103
That's what it's like when you're a bride.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.934
It's a special kind of beauty.

01:01:09.198 --> 01:01:13.044
You have a visitor, girlfriend.

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.412
- Who?
- You won't believe it.

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:39.270
Hello.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:44.011
Hello, hello.

01:01:44.066 --> 01:01:46.239
What are you doing here?

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:48.145
Two sugars, please.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:51.549
Sorry. Want some coffee?

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.416
- Tea?
- No.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.485
Nothing.

01:01:56.545 --> 01:01:59.082
Just making sure
you weren't gonna kick me out.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.293
I can't believe you're here.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:06.424
What's with the Biblical Zoo?

01:02:06.488 --> 01:02:09.298
It's my job.

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.804
I have a mobile petting zoo.

01:02:14.296 --> 01:02:16.401
You're not for real.

01:02:19.668 --> 01:02:22.308
You won't believe this,

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:25.511
but no man ever sat in this room.

01:02:25.574 --> 01:02:27.281
What do you mean?

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.220
No...

01:02:29.278 --> 01:02:32.521
male has ever been in this room.

01:02:32.581 --> 01:02:34.993
Wow.

01:02:37.419 --> 01:02:40.298
Suits me.

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.336
I need some water.

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:44.769
Can I get you a glass of water?

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.636
Sure.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.814
Hello, is Feigi home?

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:11.423
You have no idea
what a distraction you are.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:12.727
Thanks.

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:15.769
- Distraction?
- Totally.

01:03:15.824 --> 01:03:19.237
- I'm offended.
- I could never offend you.

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:22.640
I'd play along with you
since this is so surreal,

01:03:22.698 --> 01:03:26.077
but I'm untethered now.
I'm at war.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:26.943
I don't even have time to think.

01:03:27.002 --> 01:03:28.447
Sit down.

01:03:49.591 --> 01:03:51.298
So what about when we met in Ukraine?

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.966
Let's please forget about that.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:56.806
Why should I?

01:03:59.935 --> 01:04:02.711
Let's focus on the present

01:04:02.771 --> 01:04:04.808
and admit this isn't realistic.

01:04:04.873 --> 01:04:06.875
It isn't realistic?

01:04:10.212 --> 01:04:12.192
L know this is a surprise

01:04:12.247 --> 01:04:15.956
and I feel like some stupid
kid right now but...

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.207
I want you.

01:04:33.469 --> 01:04:36.814
Listen, my head is spinning.

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:38.943
I don't understand what you're saying.

01:04:39.007 --> 01:04:41.487
I'm saying I'm ready now

01:04:41.543 --> 01:04:43.079
and I believe in you and me.

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:45.591
What are you saying to me?

01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:47.649
Let's get married.

01:05:01.463 --> 01:05:03.465
I have to put a stop to this.

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:07.480
L-I don't get it.

01:05:07.536 --> 01:05:10.415
Are you trying to mess with my mind?

01:05:10.472 --> 01:05:14.010
I'm taking you seriously.

01:05:15.344 --> 01:05:17.119
I have no choice.

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.592
- It's okay, relax, Michal.
- How? How can I relax?

01:05:21.850 --> 01:05:24.421
It's easy for you to come here
with that...

01:05:24.486 --> 01:05:26.488
face of yours
and throw lines at me

01:05:26.555 --> 01:05:30.002
and I, like some idiot...
buy it.

01:05:30.058 --> 01:05:34.438
It's humiliating,
so please stop it, okay?

01:05:34.496 --> 01:05:37.067
I'm looking
for something real and simple.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:39.271
You want thrills.

01:05:39.334 --> 01:05:40.836
But I'm playing by your rules

01:05:40.903 --> 01:05:42.814
and I don't want you
to marry anyone else.

01:05:42.871 --> 01:05:45.317
I'm out on a limb here...

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.877
Stop it.
This is cruel.

01:05:47.943 --> 01:05:50.321
- Cruel?
- Yes, very cruel.

01:05:50.379 --> 01:05:54.589
It's a game to you,
but this is crucial for me.

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:58.625
You're trying to win over
the religious chick

01:05:58.687 --> 01:06:00.394
or whatever your trip is,

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:04.063
and if it doesn't work
we can just end it,

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:09.940
but I'm sorry, I can't.
I'm looking for the real deal.

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.411
I see.

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.214
You see what?

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:25.950
I don't know.
It's interesting.

01:06:26.014 --> 01:06:29.552
What is?

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:33.259
I'm over games,

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:35.928
but you're the player here, Michal.

01:06:35.991 --> 01:06:38.062
I'm right.

01:06:40.128 --> 01:06:42.233
And you're too far into it to stop.

01:06:45.634 --> 01:06:49.275
It was wishful thinking
that I'd find my true love here.

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:07:57.406 --> 01:07:59.545
What...

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:01.610
- Aren't you at the tasting?
- I was.

01:08:01.677 --> 01:08:03.520
Am I disturbing you?

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:05.889
No, not at all.

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:07.655
So how's our food?

01:08:07.716 --> 01:08:09.662
- Good, huh?
- Very good.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:10.526
Yes.

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:13.192
- Sure I'm not disturbing you?
- No, not at all.

01:08:13.255 --> 01:08:14.427
Not at all.

01:08:14.489 --> 01:08:15.627
Everything okay?

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:19.662
- Everything...
- Mostly okay?

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:25.201
Listen, I want to make a
little change to the invitation.

01:08:29.504 --> 01:08:31.745
Maybe it'll help me connect.

01:08:35.877 --> 01:08:37.481
All right.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:41.555
Come sit down.

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.564
I may be panicking,
I hope that's okay.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.997
It doesn't show...

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:50.036
I could faint any second now.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:52.368
You're funny.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:06.317
What...

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:10.050
Can you add a decoration
to the groom's side

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:12.183
to balance it out?

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:32.606
What?

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:35.011
"Mystery Groom"?

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:38.517
I'm doing my best here.

01:09:40.742 --> 01:09:44.279
Shimi, do you live here?

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:47.953
- Is that a trick question?
- No, I just want to know.

01:09:51.219 --> 01:09:53.290
I work here, so...

01:09:53.354 --> 01:09:55.835
There are late weddings,
Bar Mitzvahs,

01:09:55.891 --> 01:09:58.201
so sometimes I sleep here.

01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.831
How many times this week?

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:04.833
Are you from the authorities
or something?

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:07.107
L Pay my taxes.

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.845
What does your wife
have to say about it?

01:10:20.148 --> 01:10:22.788
My wife...

01:10:25.353 --> 01:10:29.096
Doesn't say much.

01:10:29.157 --> 01:10:32.866
Lately we haven't...

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:36.568
Said much of anything.

01:10:49.811 --> 01:10:51.757
- Telephone.
- Right.

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.959
Hello, Mrs. Klapholtz.
How are you?

01:11:03.024 --> 01:11:07.803
Fine, thank God.

01:11:07.863 --> 01:11:10.139
Okay.
Sure, I understand.

01:11:10.198 --> 01:11:13.839
But what do you mean
I "freaked him out"?

01:11:17.205 --> 01:11:20.584
Fine, fine.
Do you have someone else for me?

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.785
Thanks anyway. All the best.

01:11:25.847 --> 01:11:27.485
I wish you well.

01:11:30.886 --> 01:11:33.127
Would you marry anyone
who proposed?

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:34.792
Why would you say that?

01:11:34.856 --> 01:11:37.803
- Did you even like that guy?
- What guy?

01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:39.634
The one she set you up with?

01:11:39.694 --> 01:11:42.072
I liked him very much.

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:44.303
Assaf is...

01:11:44.366 --> 01:11:46.744
the salt of the Earth.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:48.145
So why are you giving up so easily?

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.046
He's not into it.
What can I do?

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:51.709
Hold on.

01:11:51.773 --> 01:11:54.276
What about your heart?

01:11:54.342 --> 01:11:55.912
Shimi, I don't stop for a second.

01:11:55.977 --> 01:11:58.514
You think I have time
to deal with my heart?

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:00.992
- Then what are you dealing with?
- God.

01:12:01.049 --> 01:12:02.960
Oh.

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.726
- Good for you. A real saint.
- No.

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.095
Don't exaggerate.

01:12:07.155 --> 01:12:09.465
I'm serious.
You're in a league of your own.

01:12:09.524 --> 01:12:12.300
What are you saying?

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.966
That when you're not around

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:18.273
I believe your Hanukkah miracle
could really happen.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:21.212
And when I'm around?

01:12:21.269 --> 01:12:23.545
I wonder what you could be thinking.

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.448
Shimi, do me a favor,

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:28.420
assume that my Hanukkah miracle
will happen

01:12:28.476 --> 01:12:31.116
and don't plan to see me
until my wedding day, okay?

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.954
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:53.505
Michal.

01:12:53.568 --> 01:12:56.014
It's great you can relax
in your new apartment.

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:59.280
Can't take that for granted.

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:02.015
Can you get me some water, sis?

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:04.318
Thanks.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.868
You said you had an event at six.
It's already five.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:25.400
Yes, the animals are already
in the car.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:30.879
Thanks.

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:33.715
The washing machine guy
said he'd be here by seven,

01:13:33.775 --> 01:13:36.278
so I hope they won't be late.

01:13:36.344 --> 01:13:37.550
Okay-

01:13:37.612 --> 01:13:38.955
How are you?

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:39.992
Good.

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:43.257
. Very
. Yes?

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:48.493
Hello?

01:13:48.556 --> 01:13:52.231
Hi. How's it going?

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:57.005
Can I call you back
in a few minutes?

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:59.978
Sure. Bye.

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:07.349
Excuse me, who was that?

01:14:07.409 --> 01:14:09.946
Who else?

01:14:10.011 --> 01:14:11.991
Sagi?

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:15.119
- It couldn't be anyone else.
- No way.

01:14:15.183 --> 01:14:18.426
Unbelievable.
How did that suddenly happen?

01:14:18.486 --> 01:14:20.488
It's not suddenly,
it's a whole life, Michal.

01:14:20.555 --> 01:14:23.297
It's commitment, responsibility.

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:28.034
How come you...the most
unbalanced person I know,

01:14:28.096 --> 01:14:30.508
always know how things will work out?

01:14:30.565 --> 01:14:31.908
You know, too.

01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:35.312
I've never known less.

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:38.544
You do know,
but your head is in the clouds.

01:14:38.606 --> 01:14:41.086
You need to come back to reality.

01:14:41.142 --> 01:14:42.416
Decide what is true and what is false.

01:14:42.477 --> 01:14:44.684
I say, truth is what works for you.

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:46.692
Anything else isn't real.

01:14:53.388 --> 01:14:55.925
He's amazing!

01:15:17.445 --> 01:15:24.294
a' Come to me,
Mama, come to me I

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:45.143
Yoss! Yoss!

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:51.114
- Yoss, can I get a picture?
- Sure.

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:57.121
- Can I get a picture, Yoss?
- Sure.

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:00.187
Great.

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:02.194
- You were awesome.
- Thanks.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.059
Can I please have your autograph?

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:17.508
Thanks.

01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:20.671
Will you please marry me?

01:17:20.735 --> 01:17:23.739
Get in line, girl.

01:17:33.314 --> 01:17:35.294
How are you?

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:41.093
Okay-

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:42.760
- I don't know.
- No?

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.531
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:49.868
And you?

01:17:49.931 --> 01:17:51.103
Everything's light.

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.009
- Light?
- Yeah.

01:17:56.337 --> 01:17:58.578
What do you want, Michal?

01:18:08.249 --> 01:18:10.752
I feel like...

01:18:10.818 --> 01:18:13.731
everything I say comes out
wrong.

01:18:13.788 --> 01:18:15.426
That's true.

01:18:15.490 --> 01:18:17.265
The words aren't working for you.

01:18:30.371 --> 01:18:32.612
Then tell me what to do.

01:18:32.674 --> 01:18:35.348
What am I supposed to do now?

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:41.187
Michali.

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:43.855
You are full of light.

01:18:43.918 --> 01:18:46.762
You don't have to do anything.

01:18:54.829 --> 01:18:57.537
Listen to me. In two
days you'll be married.

01:19:00.935 --> 01:19:04.109
- How do you know?
- I just do.

01:19:06.941 --> 01:19:08.682
You play to win.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:13.019
Yeah.

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:24.898
Yoss!

01:19:34.636 --> 01:19:39.210
That was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.515
Not necessarily.

01:19:44.345 --> 01:19:47.849
How's about we go to the beach?

01:19:47.915 --> 01:19:49.792
Okay, let's go.

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:06.743
How are you?

01:20:08.269 --> 01:20:09.748
Good.

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:15.886
You are getting married in two days.

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.662
Mot Feigi, daughter oi Eliika,

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:29.565
tell me the truth
and nothing but the truth.

01:20:29.624 --> 01:20:31.695
Do you believe it will happen?

01:20:31.759 --> 01:20:34.638
- Just a little?
- I'm counting on it.

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:42.275
It's the salt of the Earth guy
I met last week.

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:43.782
So answer.

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:50.484
I have a good feeling about this.

01:20:53.648 --> 01:20:55.628
Michal?

01:20:55.683 --> 01:20:57.720
Yes?

01:20:57.785 --> 01:20:59.423
What's up?

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:02.798
Sorry I'm calling so late.
Is it okay?

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:05.997
It's fine, great.

01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:07.471
How are you?

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:12.335
Good.
Very good.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.038
Glad to hear it.

01:21:15.837 --> 01:21:18.010
How are you?

01:21:18.072 --> 01:21:21.884
Is it okay that I'm calling you?

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:23.251
It's great.

01:21:23.311 --> 01:21:25.257
I know it's late,

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:28.226
I just want you to know
that you're hotheaded

01:21:28.282 --> 01:21:30.592
and super uptight,

01:21:30.651 --> 01:21:34.963
but I can't get you out of my mind.

01:21:35.022 --> 01:21:36.558
okay-

01:21:36.624 --> 01:21:39.332
I think we should meet again.

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.541
Michal?

01:21:47.835 --> 01:21:51.408
Where are you tonight?

01:21:51.472 --> 01:21:53.611
I'm on army reserves duty.

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:57.916
When do you come home?

01:21:57.979 --> 01:22:00.084
In a week.

01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:12.937
- Michal?
- Yeah, I'm here.

01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:21.146
Are you okay?

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:23.842
I'm getting married in two days.

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:27.717
What?
When did that happen?

01:22:27.775 --> 01:22:29.413
With whom?

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:32.083
I don't have a groom...

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:36.260
But besides that, it's a done deal.

01:22:36.317 --> 01:22:38.263
Are you joking?

01:22:38.319 --> 01:22:43.792
No, and I want to apologize for being
so uptight on our date.

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:46.168
L can't tell if you're joking.

01:22:51.632 --> 01:22:55.580
7 p.m., 8th night of Hanukkah,
the King David Hall.

01:22:55.636 --> 01:22:58.845
Assaf, you're more than welcome
to come.

01:22:58.906 --> 01:23:02.513
Wow, I'll have to
wrap my head around this.

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:07.551
Good night.

01:23:12.186 --> 01:23:14.757
Kosher.

01:23:14.822 --> 01:23:19.896
MICHAL'S GETTING MARRIED

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:22.532
Kosher.

01:23:22.597 --> 01:23:28.104
You've immersed properly
and you're pure.

01:23:37.778 --> 01:23:39.883
She's so lovely, so beautiful.

01:23:39.947 --> 01:23:41.517
Congratulations.

01:23:41.582 --> 01:23:43.152
Are you the mother'?

01:23:43.217 --> 01:23:45.219
What a lovely daughter you have.

01:23:45.286 --> 01:23:48.597
It's so exciting.
What an honor.

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:50.363
Congratulations.

01:23:50.424 --> 01:23:52.563
Shosh, with respect, please stop it.

01:23:52.627 --> 01:23:55.005
We have to keep her spirits up.

01:23:55.062 --> 01:23:57.235
We need to be there for Michal.

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:58.709
You're right,

01:23:58.766 --> 01:24:00.837
but how I feel is no joke, either.

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:04.807
What do you feel, Mom?

01:24:04.872 --> 01:24:07.580
Humiliated.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:10.589
You can't imagine
how embarrassed I am.

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:13.823
I'm sorry.

01:24:13.881 --> 01:24:15.258
I know.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.195
Will she freak if she sees me?

01:24:24.258 --> 01:24:26.670
- If she won't I will.
- Bad idea.

01:24:26.727 --> 01:24:30.072
Maybe Michal wants to reconcile.

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:33.010
Don't go. Okay?

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:35.172
Sta}!-

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.723
My darling.

01:24:55.389 --> 01:24:58.529
My sweetheart.

01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:14.847
Thank you.

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:27.031
You're the icing on the cake.

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:30.262
No way..

01:25:30.324 --> 01:25:32.998
No way are you "not"
getting married tomorrow.

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:35.370
I'm certain of it.

01:25:35.429 --> 01:25:38.205
I know it. Know it.

01:27:32.346 --> 01:27:34.587
Michali?

01:27:34.648 --> 01:27:35.956
What time is it?

01:27:36.016 --> 01:27:38.428
7:30. Are you coming?

01:27:40.955 --> 01:27:44.869
- Coming where?
- To Michal's wedding.

01:27:44.925 --> 01:27:46.871
Of course.

01:27:46.927 --> 01:27:49.271
Of course I'm coming.

01:28:18.425 --> 01:28:20.063
This is it.

01:28:22.596 --> 01:28:24.439
Say it.

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:34.109
Anything can happen.

01:28:34.175 --> 01:28:36.314
Everything is possible.

01:30:39.533 --> 01:30:46.849
a' Now the heavens
are opening up for us... I

01:30:50.544 --> 01:30:53.684
Michali, we're here.

01:30:53.747 --> 01:30:56.956
Wake up, honey.

01:30:57.017 --> 01:30:58.655
Let's go.

01:31:30.784 --> 01:31:33.196
I'll go park.

01:31:39.593 --> 01:31:43.234
My darling, my darling.

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:50.206
Come, darling.

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.745
Good luck.

01:34:07.741 --> 01:34:11.883
Mind if I go out for some fresh air?

01:34:12.880 --> 01:34:14.291
Go ahead.

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:18.729
I'll go with Mom, okay?

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:28.571
We're all rooting for you here, honey.

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:31.940
- This bubble is about to burst.
- No.

01:34:34.735 --> 01:34:36.737
You must believe.

01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:55.031
HEY-

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.868
How are you?

01:35:00.928 --> 01:35:05.809
I don't know...
I'm feeling overwhelmed, Shimi.

01:35:05.866 --> 01:35:09.143
I understand.
Want something to drink?

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:12.344
I'm fasting.

01:35:14.241 --> 01:35:16.653
You really got everyone's attention here.

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:21.384
You think that's what I'm doing?

01:35:21.448 --> 01:35:24.452
Big time.

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:28.261
How come there's no groom here?

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:29.460
Thanks, Shimi.

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:32.197
I was sure...

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:35.103
I don't know,
that someone would be here.

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:37.768
I'm glad you've been paying
such close attention,

01:35:37.831 --> 01:35:40.334
- but...
- Marry me.

01:35:41.768 --> 01:35:45.614
Now, you and me, like in the movies.

01:35:45.672 --> 01:35:47.515
- What?
- Let's just do it.

01:35:47.574 --> 01:35:50.851
Put an end to this.

01:35:50.911 --> 01:35:53.790
What are you saying?

01:35:53.847 --> 01:35:57.454
The suspense is killing me.
Seriously.

01:35:57.517 --> 01:35:59.292
Hold on, Shimi.

01:35:59.353 --> 01:36:03.802
I don't follow you.

01:36:03.857 --> 01:36:05.632
I'm fasting and I'm dizzy.

01:36:05.692 --> 01:36:07.831
You're already married, aren't you?

01:36:18.071 --> 01:36:20.984
Honey, why don't we tell
the band to play something?

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:22.748
What do you say?

01:36:22.809 --> 01:36:24.982
This silence is deafening.

01:36:25.045 --> 01:36:29.357
- Whatever you want, Mom.
- Something upbeat, right, honey?

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:33.159
- What?
- I'll go tell them. How are you?

01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.929
- What?
- Forget I asked.

01:36:57.911 --> 01:37:00.892
Feigi, I'm weak.
God help me.

01:37:00.947 --> 01:37:04.394
Who were you talking to?

01:37:04.451 --> 01:37:06.397
Listen to me,

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:09.627
I'm on the brink.

01:37:11.358 --> 01:37:13.531
I think I'm starting to hallucinate.

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:18.076
I'm not sure my heart can take this.

01:37:18.131 --> 01:37:21.840
- Tell me what you want.
- Reassurance, Feigi.

01:37:23.570 --> 01:37:25.243
May r;?

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:39.531
Can you come with me for a moment?

01:37:41.221 --> 01:37:44.498
You're married, aren't you?

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:46.731
Not as of one week ago.

01:37:46.793 --> 01:37:50.798
We've been separated for a year
and suddenly she agreed to a divorce.

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.605
Weird, huh?

01:37:54.634 --> 01:37:56.272
Can you come with me?

01:37:56.336 --> 01:37:59.977
I tried to get up before and I got dizzy.

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.417
I'm so weak.

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:03.648
It's time for a wedding now.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:09.486
Look at the chuppah.

01:38:09.549 --> 01:38:10.926
Just look.

01:38:17.858 --> 01:38:20.498
Let's fill that chuppah
with people tonight.

01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:25.801
Shimi, what do you think all this is?

01:38:25.866 --> 01:38:27.277
What do you mean, "all this"?

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:33.008
Some kind of circus?

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:35.417
I want the real deal.

01:38:35.475 --> 01:38:38.718
I don't want to tick off
"wedding" and then get a divorce.

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:41.259
- Why a divorce?
- That's what you're saying.

01:38:41.314 --> 01:38:42.554
I didn't say divorce.

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.118
- No?
- Never.

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:46.926
You're being silly
because you just got divorced.

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:49.627
You don't understand,
we didn't stand a chance...

01:38:49.689 --> 01:38:52.693
Say it clearly,

01:38:52.759 --> 01:38:54.363
I'm fasting, I'm dizzy

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:55.964
and I can't follow what you're saying.

01:38:56.029 --> 01:38:58.407
She didn't want me.

01:38:58.465 --> 01:39:01.071
She didn't want children,
she didn't want God,

01:39:01.134 --> 01:39:02.704
she didn't want anything.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.411
What do you want from me?

01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:12.616
To come with me.

01:39:12.679 --> 01:39:15.785
- Where to?
- To the chuppah. I'm telling you.

01:39:15.849 --> 01:39:18.762
- Why?
- Because!

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:21.766
- That's not enough.
- Sure it is.

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:24.359
- I don't buy it.
- Sure you do.

01:39:24.424 --> 01:39:26.529
You are not communicating.

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:28.266
- You're not listening.
- To what?

01:39:28.328 --> 01:39:31.400
I want to marry you.

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:35.003
Tonight, here.
For real.

01:39:36.736 --> 01:39:38.340
Cut it out.

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:42.848
This wedding plan of yours

01:39:42.909 --> 01:39:44.445
is like a crazy beautiful
start-up venture.

01:39:48.448 --> 01:39:51.361
- I have to sit down.
- You are sitting down. Relax.

01:39:51.418 --> 01:39:54.024
I'm totally out of it.

01:39:54.087 --> 01:39:58.058
It's just the adrenaline.
Look at me.

01:39:58.124 --> 01:39:59.535
Look at me.

01:40:03.763 --> 01:40:05.572
Well?
What do you say?

01:40:10.570 --> 01:40:12.846
You're one hell of a man.

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:16.479
Really.

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:19.456
And your heart is...

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:23.222
amazing,
but you're doing this out of pity.

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:24.694
What?

01:40:29.689 --> 01:40:32.795
I'm not saying it's not charming,

01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:35.465
but that's not the point.

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:37.736
Michali, you think I pity you?

01:40:37.797 --> 01:40:40.937
You pity me. Absolutely.

01:40:42.102 --> 01:40:44.275
Remember the first time we met?

01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:50.583
When I came to book the hall,
about 1,000 years ago.

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.749
No, we first met at my mom's.

01:40:59.252 --> 01:41:02.631
You sat there reading "Psalms"

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:04.327
and I said to myself,

01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:07.429
"No way does she need
my mom to get married."

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:16.510
This is totally crazy.

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:19.210
It's so crazy.

01:41:19.272 --> 01:41:22.082
You know why?

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:25.282
All month I've been thinking,
"If no man

01:41:25.345 --> 01:41:27.985
"comes to walk you down the aisle...

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:30.528
I will."

01:41:37.591 --> 01:41:40.538
Michal...

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:44.132
imagine how amazing it'll be
if you marry me now.

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.944
Are you with me?

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:58.317
Who's your closest friend?

01:41:58.378 --> 01:41:59.823
Feigi.

01:41:59.879 --> 01:42:01.881
Imagine saying to Feigi,

01:42:01.948 --> 01:42:03.791
"Let's go, we're starting."

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:09.829
Imagine her face.

01:42:09.889 --> 01:42:13.200
Two minutes ago nothing was
happening and suddenly...

01:42:13.259 --> 01:42:14.897
here it is.

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:20.103
Imagine...

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:23.144
That I promise to care for you.

01:42:28.541 --> 01:42:30.680
That I'm committed my love only to you...

01:42:33.246 --> 01:42:36.125
And respect you...

01:42:36.182 --> 01:42:37.855
and cherish you.

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:44.558
What do you say, Michali?

01:42:48.294 --> 01:42:50.240
Will you go for it?

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:13.487
You smell so good.

01:43:15.188 --> 01:43:17.600
You're really...

01:43:26.599 --> 01:43:29.205
I'm going to talk to the Rabbi.

01:43:47.654 --> 01:43:50.328
Well?

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.870
Feigi, get the oil lamps.

01:43:52.926 --> 01:43:54.428
I'm getting married.

01:43:54.494 --> 01:43:57.805
This is too much.

01:43:57.864 --> 01:44:00.811
Shosh, please tell me,
where are the oil lamps?

01:44:00.867 --> 01:44:03.711
- What oil lamps?
- The candles.

01:44:03.770 --> 01:44:07.479
Mom, the groom is coming
to cover my face now.

01:44:07.540 --> 01:44:13.183
- Stop it, baby.
- You can't fool me.

01:44:13.246 --> 01:44:14.919
Feigi, he's coming.

01:44:14.981 --> 01:44:16.392
I'll end up having a stroke.

01:44:16.449 --> 01:44:20.022
Shosh, let's go look for the lamps.

01:44:20.086 --> 01:44:23.329
Give me an update.

01:44:23.389 --> 01:44:25.801
Shimi is the groom.

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:28.339
Who's Shimi?

01:44:28.394 --> 01:44:30.067
The owner of the hall.

01:44:30.130 --> 01:44:31.666
Remember the lady with the fish
I told you about?

01:44:31.731 --> 01:44:34.439
He's her son.

01:44:34.501 --> 01:44:36.777
How can I help?

01:44:36.836 --> 01:44:40.010
Take off my earrings.

01:44:40.073 --> 01:44:42.883
Okay, it's all taken care of.
Tell me you're okay.

01:44:44.277 --> 01:44:47.087
This must be what drugs
are like, Feigi,

01:44:47.147 --> 01:44:49.718
but way better.

01:44:49.783 --> 01:44:51.228
But pray for me

01:44:51.284 --> 01:44:55.164
that I'll never take this
feeling for granted, okay?

01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:58.498
Neither of us will.

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.411
What is this, Michali?

01:45:18.244 --> 01:45:20.850
The end of the world as we know it,
Mom.
