Can you help us or not?

15:12.280 --> 15:13.555
Why should I help you?

15:13.960 --> 15:16.475
Last time, when I needed your help,
you let me down

15:16.520 --> 15:17.520
big time.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.376
I don't forget a thing like that.
- GIRL: Listen...

15:19.400 --> 15:22.074
as much I enjoy all this macho posturing,
we really need a car

15:22.120 --> 15:24.176
so if you can just make up your mind
whether you're gonna help us or not

15:24.200 --> 15:25.200
that would be great.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.833
I like you. You've got spunk.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.320
Thank you.

15:30.120 --> 15:31.395

15:42.960 --> 15:43.960

15:46.560 --> 15:48.950
I'll do my level best
to get you a car by sundown.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
But here's the thing.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.878
No matter where you are, what you want

15:53.400 --> 15:55.710
you can only have two out of three things.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.917
Now you clearly want this car fast, yeah?

15:58.520 --> 16:01.115
And I know for a fact
that you're gonna want it to be good.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.035
So don't expect
to be getting it fucking cheap.

16:04.120 --> 16:05.156
That's all I'm saying.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.076
Take care. See ya.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.630
Are those two racing?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.200
They're planning on racing.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.560
We just need somewhere to lie low
for a couple of hours, that's all.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.150
It's a bad idea.
I've already been in one car crash today.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.471
Hey! You're never gonna believe this,
but guess what?

16:34.880 --> 16:36.280
We just happen to be in the area

16:36.320 --> 16:38.720
and I wondered if it'd be OK
if we stopped by to pay a visit?

16:41.360 --> 16:44.114
Uh, before we hand over the money...

16:45.280 --> 16:48.318
we'd like to have a look
at the merchandise, please.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.753
MAN:
There you are. Race your way free.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.990
I assume there's 250,000 in there?

17:05.560 --> 17:07.118
Yeah.
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

17:10.200 --> 17:11.599
Here. Hold that.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.680
It's been a pleasure doing business with you,
Mr Donahue.

17:23.720 --> 17:24.720
Alright.

17:25.640 --> 17:26.756
Hang on a minute, Dad.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.160
Well, don't you think
we should finish checking it first?

17:30.560 --> 17:33.519
Uh, that... is that OK?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.120
Go ahead.

17:44.680 --> 17:45.680
This isn't it.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.794
This isn't what we agreed.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.200
MAN:
What you talking about?

17:52.520 --> 17:54.398
It's basically just an empty shell.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.391
There's no drive inside. It's worthless.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.560
Are you saying it's a piece of shit?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.160
Go on, just say it. "It's a piece of shit."

18:05.640 --> 18:06.640
HE LAUGHS

18:08.560 --> 18:09.560
What?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
It's a piece of...?

18:15.000 --> 18:16.400
HE EXHALES
- OK.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.760
Well, it is.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.156
It's a piece of shit.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.239
Course it is. It's fucking useless.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
Smart kid.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.030
But guess what?

18:27.080 --> 18:30.710
Sometimes being clever
doesn't mean fucking anything.

18:33.360 --> 18:34.360
No, no!

18:39.600 --> 18:41.159
Look, you don't... you don't know me.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.194
Alright? And I don't know you.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.551
But let me tell you something.

18:45.880 --> 18:49.237
I... I consider myself to be...
normally...

18:49.320 --> 18:52.040
a very level-headed, uh, kind of a guy.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.949
But tonight,
I'm gonna risk everything I have

18:55.000 --> 18:59.756
everything that's good in my life,
to get us out of this country.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.798
And I'm, I'm, I'm willing to do anything...

19:05.600 --> 19:06.670
to make that happen.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.433
Now, we had an agreement.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.960
You've already got the cash.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.192
So why don't you just give us
what we came for

19:14.800 --> 19:17.395
and we can just be on our way?

19:22.200 --> 19:23.200
Yeah?

19:39.160 --> 19:40.160
Here.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.360
Let him... him a bit.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.320
Do you want me to check it?

20:37.440 --> 20:38.960
No, I don't think we need to check it.

20:41.680 --> 20:42.680
Come on.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.158
THEY LAUGH

21:13.960 --> 21:15.440
How old would you say she was?

21:15.480 --> 21:17.278
Eight years old? Nine?

21:17.320 --> 21:20.199
Oh, I dunno. Look, they'll track down
an uncle or an aunt or something.

21:20.240 --> 21:22.960
Here, do you think that McLaren
was gonna be part of the race?

21:24.120 --> 21:26.510
Do you have any idea
how callous that makes you sound?

21:26.560 --> 21:28.016
Yeah, well, y'know, it's a coping strategy.

21:28.040 --> 21:29.474
I'm crying inside.
- PHONE CHIMES

21:29.520 --> 21:31.477
Did you see the footage
from last year's race?

21:31.640 --> 21:34.553
Rio de Janeiro? It's unbelievable.

21:35.080 --> 21:37.914
Absolute carnage.
These people, they're insane.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.480
IN AMERICAN ACCENT:
"Race your way free."

21:40.680 --> 21:42.672
Yeah, but freedom always comes at a price.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.476
Oh, sorry, was that...?

21:44.520 --> 21:46.477
Was that you being cynical?

21:46.520 --> 21:47.840
It's a coping strategy.

21:48.080 --> 21:50.776
MICHAEL ON VOICEMAIL: <i>Hey, you're never gonna
believe this, but guess what?</i>

21:50.800 --> 21:53.056
<i>We just happen to be in the area
and I wondered if it would be OK</i>

21:53.080 --> 21:55.240
<i>if we swung by to pay a visit?</i>
- Is everything alright?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.714
Anything I can do to help or...?

22:02.640 --> 22:04.074
Yeah. Cover for me.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
MICHAEL:
You OK?

22:22.080 --> 22:23.434
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

22:25.080 --> 22:26.080
I don't know.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.797
Must be weird being back here
after all this time.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.356
Isn't weird at all.

22:31.920 --> 22:32.956
You finding it weird?

22:34.320 --> 22:35.320
Nah.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.270
It's totally normal.

22:41.640 --> 22:42.756
That on the other hand...

22:53.400 --> 22:55.198
LOCKS CLICK

23:02.360 --> 23:03.360
GIRL:
Who's that?

23:03.800 --> 23:05.553
SHALLOW BREATHS

23:09.600 --> 23:12.069
WOMAN HISSES

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
Oh, my God.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.472
WOMAN RASPS

23:15.560 --> 23:16.560
Mum?

23:25.480 --> 23:26.480
Kaye.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.120
She's hyper-sensitive to light.

23:33.440 --> 23:34.271
Shh.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.589
GIRL:
What happened to her?

23:39.440 --> 23:40.715
I thought she was dead.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.637
WOMAN:
He was in a car accident three weeks ago.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.833
The wound hasn't finished healing.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.519
There's practically no scar tissue.

24:02.200 --> 24:03.200
He's young.

24:03.760 --> 24:04.989
He was in perfect health.

24:05.320 --> 24:09.109
As far as we know.
His medical records aren't exactly detailed.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.793
Hasn't even filled in his home address.

24:12.040 --> 24:13.793
Do we need a psychological profile?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.393
I'm not here to judge him, Kaye.

24:18.760 --> 24:20.319
(VO):
<i>I'm here to help him walk again.</i>

24:34.000 --> 24:35.878
MICHAEL GRUNTS

24:36.920 --> 24:39.116
Welcome to Kiloran Medical Facility,
Mr Garwick.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.469
Hope your journey was OK.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
Normal.

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
Normal.

24:50.160 --> 24:51.160
Normal.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.520
Not normal.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
You know what?

25:09.600 --> 25:10.600
You can stop now.

25:11.120 --> 25:13.191
We do need to assess how much you can feel.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.356
You wanna know how I feel?

25:16.280 --> 25:17.350
Like my life's over.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.520
Do you think I'm gonna walk again?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.957
You wouldn't have been offered a place
on this trial if there wasn't a chance.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.716
Trust me, Dr Newman's
one of the best in her field.

25:31.400 --> 25:33.551
But you're gonna need to do exactly as I say.
OK?

25:35.480 --> 25:36.480
Yeah, OK.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.599
Just relax, it's not gonna hurt.

25:45.880 --> 25:47.473
MICHAEL:
So she's infected?

25:48.440 --> 25:51.478
Can she still understand what you say to her?
- Sometimes...

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
definitely.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.396
The rest of the time...

25:55.720 --> 25:56.551
SHE SIGHS

25:56.720 --> 25:57.836
I don't know for sure.

25:59.440 --> 26:00.476
Why didn't you tell me?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.560
I tried. I just really didn't know how to.

26:09.640 --> 26:11.200
Is there a chance she could get better?

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I don't know.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.835
She was searching for a cure
when she got sick.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.673
I monitor her every day,
trying to finish the work that she started

26:19.720 --> 26:20.949
but, so far...

26:21.040 --> 26:22.040
Nothing, right?

26:23.600 --> 26:25.751
Look, I'm gonna give her something
to help her sleep.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.590
Why don't you go and...

26:29.800 --> 26:31.154
go and talk to her before you go?

26:32.560 --> 26:33.560
What do I say?

26:35.240 --> 26:36.240
Say anything.

26:37.640 --> 26:38.640
Tell her about your life.

26:43.360 --> 26:44.396
Just talk to her.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.280
It's good to see you again.

27:02.480 --> 27:06.235
You know, I'm...
I'm amazed that they released you.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.200
Brookeheath are out of control.
- They didn't.

27:13.280 --> 27:14.953
Ruby bust me out this morning.

27:15.840 --> 27:16.990
You can't be here.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.631
I'm sorry but I can't have people
finding out about her.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.637
You shouldn't, you shouldn't be here.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.616
Brookeheath will be looking for you.
- We just need a couple of hours.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.711
They're gonna come here,
and they're gonna find her.

27:27.760 --> 27:28.955
I can't allow that to happen.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.829
She's my mum, Michael.

27:30.880 --> 27:32.712
She's all I've got.
- DEVICE BEEPS

27:36.560 --> 27:37.914
Oh, you're racing.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.753
You're racing, course you are.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.640
We're getting out of here, Kaye.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.720
SHE SIGHS

27:45.560 --> 27:47.153
DEVICE BEEPS

27:50.280 --> 27:51.280
Dad?

27:58.240 --> 27:59.560
The start coordinates are in.

28:04.920 --> 28:05.920
OK.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.440
OK, we're on.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.872
D'you remember when we first moved in here?

28:15.920 --> 28:16.956
The coordinates are in.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.315
We managed to fit everything we owned
in the back of our car.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.199
Now we're doing the same thing again.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.240
We start south.

28:25.960 --> 28:27.917
So, I'm guessing we'll head north.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.313
Alice Springs, Jakarta, Brazil...

28:30.360 --> 28:32.352
Each race was longer than the last one, so...

28:32.880 --> 28:35.315
I think we'll probably head
as far north as we can go.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.040
I know how hard you're trying
to make this work but...

28:39.280 --> 28:40.953
maybe we need to be more realistic.

28:42.760 --> 28:43.760
What do you mean?

28:45.600 --> 28:46.600
Stay here.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.757
No. We can't stay here.

28:49.200 --> 28:50.839
We've been through this.
- Meg could.

28:51.240 --> 28:54.551
She hasn't done anything wrong.
Neither have either of us.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.515
They're gonna come for him.

28:58.800 --> 28:59.800
Our son.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.718
It's just a matter of time. You know that.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.515
And when they do, they'll take him away.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.439
But he deleted everything.
- Nothing gets deleted, Jen.

29:07.480 --> 29:08.755
Everything is somewhere.

29:09.720 --> 29:10.720
They'll find it.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.950
They'll take him away
and we'll never see him again.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.036
We stick together no matter what the odds.

29:22.840 --> 29:23.840
I'm just scared.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.517
I'm just so scared.
- Yeah, of course you are.

29:28.480 --> 29:29.480
We all are.

29:31.520 --> 29:33.000
But if we stick together...

29:34.440 --> 29:35.874
I promise you we can do this.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.679
CHIME ON LOUDSPEAKER

29:46.680 --> 29:49.149
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i>The curfew will begin in ten minutes.</i>

29:49.400 --> 29:51.517
<i>Please return to your homes immediately.</i>

29:52.120 --> 29:55.397
<i>Remember the curfew is here
for your own safety.</i>

29:55.520 --> 29:58.797
<i>Breaking the terms of the curfew
is a serious offence.</i>

29:59.320 --> 30:01.596
<i>Thank you for your patience
and understanding.</i>

30:13.640 --> 30:14.710
We said by dusk.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.640
By dusk, you'd get me something.

30:16.840 --> 30:18.797
Yeah, er, about that.

30:19.920 --> 30:23.516
Er, turns out it was harder than I thought
to get the kind of wheels you need.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.195
<i>You're racing, aren't you?</i>

30:28.400 --> 30:31.438
You've sold me down the river.
- Look, I'm not gonna lie to you, Michael.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.480
I'm sorry.

30:32.680 --> 30:34.478
But I'm about to become a father again.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.433
That kind of thing makes a man
re-evaluate his priorities.

30:41.600 --> 30:43.239
It was the right thing to do, baby.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.520
Yeah.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.392
ENGINE ROARS

31:11.520 --> 31:12.520
Shit.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.832
Both of you,
get to the back of the house now.

31:16.280 --> 31:17.111
It's them.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.640
I told you this would happen.
- Look, just do as I say. Please.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.275
But it's you they're looking for.
Leave it with me.

31:24.440 --> 31:25.440
HE SIGHS

31:25.640 --> 31:26.640
Go on!

31:26.960 --> 31:27.960
Shit.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.479
KNOCK ON DOOR

31:30.840 --> 31:31.840
Who is it?

31:34.040 --> 31:36.555
Michael Garwick. Where is he?

31:37.160 --> 31:38.640
Don't know what you're talking about.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.113
I'm going to ask you one more time.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.194
Where is Michael Garwick?

31:46.520 --> 31:47.795
There's no one here except me.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.036
KAYE GROANS

31:51.880 --> 31:52.880
Try again.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.516
Tear the place apart.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.240
Sir.
- You can't go in there!

32:14.040 --> 32:15.040
Hm.

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
Open the door.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.159
DOOR OPENS

32:25.480 --> 32:26.834
This woman's been infected.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.470
She's my mother.

32:31.520 --> 32:32.715
Not anymore, she's not.

Roman, can you do an idiot check
upstairs for me?

33:26.920 --> 33:27.920
What?

33:29.120 --> 33:30.120
What's wrong?

33:30.440 --> 33:31.954
She told me not to say anything.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.636
But then she also told me
to say that she loved you, so...

33:34.680 --> 33:36.319
Wait, wait. When? When did she say that?

33:36.360 --> 33:38.238
A few minutes ago.
- Oh, for God's sake...

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760

33:42.920 --> 33:43.920
Meg?

33:44.480 --> 33:46.437
Meg! Come inside, it's not safe out here!

33:46.760 --> 33:47.671
Can we talk about this?

33:47.720 --> 33:49.996
We already did that, Dad,
you wouldn't listen.

33:50.200 --> 33:52.040
Go, Zane. Drive.
- But... Zane! Don't you dare!

33:52.080 --> 33:53.309
Don't... don't!

33:53.880 --> 33:55.030
Meg, I'm serious.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.715
Oh, my gosh. This is so embarrassing.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
Meg!

33:59.720 --> 34:02.679
Look, there... there are...
there are things you don't know.

34:02.720 --> 34:04.518
Alright? Things that we haven't told you.

34:04.560 --> 34:08.839
Now I know you think this is all my fault,
but if you just stop and come in...

34:09.280 --> 34:10.280
I'll explain.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.120
Speed up.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.080
Meg, please.

34:14.600 --> 34:15.600
Stop this!

34:15.679 --> 34:16.830
Speed up a bit...
- Meg!

34:16.880 --> 34:18.109
...and then just brake.

There is a possibility
you may regain some sensation.

The chances of you
making a full recovery are...

38:29.200 --> 38:30.714
they're small.
- I'm OK with risk.

38:32.200 --> 38:33.395

38:34.680 --> 38:35.875
You like him, don't you?

38:39.160 --> 38:42.312
I think he's stubborn, reckless
and ambivalent about his future.

39:29.880 --> 39:31.640
I want you to at least think about it first.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.999
I'm not giving you my ambulance.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.271
It's like it was purpose-built for this race.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.776
You were there at the beginning, Michael,
you're still the best chance we have

39:40.800 --> 39:42.519

39:42.800 --> 39:43.870
You can't just run away.

- Yeah, you are.

39:45.240 --> 39:46.560
That's exactly what you're doing.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.717

Alright, alright.

Wait.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.800
Yeah.

and if I can get there,
I can help them find it.

40:09.280 --> 40:10.350

You believe in it? The island?

It's real.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.876
Kaye, I can feel it.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.717
