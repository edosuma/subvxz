00:48.459 --> 00:50.940
Boss. Have a look at the blonde.

00:56.699 --> 00:59.459
She'll be picking sick out of
that blonde hair come midnight.

01:00.739 --> 01:03.220
Mark my words, Larry.
Same every year.

01:04.659 --> 01:07.459
Spring bloody balls.

01:07.500 --> 01:10.019
We all know
how the creation story starts.

01:10.060 --> 01:12.060
But even though
we've been cast out of Eden,

01:12.099 --> 01:15.459
it doesn't mean we have to wait
until heaven to glimpse paradise.

01:15.500 --> 01:18.860
Behave. Behave.
Whoa!

01:20.259 --> 01:22.259
SIGHING
What did I tell ya?

01:22.300 --> 01:23.659
And just because we're fallen

01:23.700 --> 01:25.700
doesn't mean
we have to keep falling.

01:25.739 --> 01:29.060
The insider can report
that Tobias Montague,

01:29.099 --> 01:31.220
second son of the Earl of Montague,

01:31.259 --> 01:32.940
was seen trading blows

01:32.980 --> 01:36.179
with High Court judge Hugh Teague's
son and namesake.

01:36.220 --> 01:39.099
"Too much punch?"

01:39.140 --> 01:41.379
We don't have to listen
to the snakes.

01:41.420 --> 01:43.780
We don't have to eat the apples.

01:43.819 --> 01:45.659
Though I could probably
make an exception

01:45.700 --> 01:46.980
for Mrs Chapman's apple pie.

01:47.019 --> 01:48.539
LAUGHTER

01:48.580 --> 01:50.500
We can never return to Eden,

01:50.539 --> 01:55.340
but through our choices,
our actions, with Jesus' help,

01:55.379 --> 01:57.899
I believe we can get close.

01:57.940 --> 01:59.940
We are all Adam and Eve...

01:59.980 --> 02:02.700
and the world is our garden.

02:02.739 --> 02:05.420
Amen.
ALL: Amen.

02:09.818 --> 02:12.420
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

02:19.700 --> 02:21.700
Here we are, then.

02:23.100 --> 02:25.059
Good old Grantchester.
Hmm.

02:28.059 --> 02:30.459
Quiet compared to Marrakech,
isn't it?

02:32.019 --> 02:34.019
I think anywhere would be.

02:36.420 --> 02:37.660
Until next year, then.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.700
Well, I'll see you before then.

02:40.739 --> 02:42.300
Inshallah.

02:47.019 --> 02:49.019
I think we're allowed
a stiff handshake.

03:10.059 --> 03:13.059
Mmm. Thanks, Marie.

03:15.219 --> 03:17.219
I'm surprised you made it.

03:17.260 --> 03:19.459
A hangover's never kept me
from a good breakfast.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.499
I'm not talking about the hangover.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.540
I thought staying in a college bed

03:23.580 --> 03:26.339
might have...
stirred some of the old instincts.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.499
Yeah. Sleep.

03:31.700 --> 03:33.100
How was your night?

03:33.140 --> 03:36.300
Hmm? Like being a PC again.
All hands on deck.

03:36.339 --> 03:39.660
Six drunk disorderlies,
two serious assaults.

03:39.700 --> 03:42.219
But only four incidents
of indecent exposure.

03:44.059 --> 03:46.219
What is it with bloody students
this time of year?

03:46.260 --> 03:48.660
It's the end of term, Geordie.
Just letting their hair down.

03:48.700 --> 03:50.140
And their trousers.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.619
Who's letting their trousers down?

03:51.660 --> 03:53.380
Oh. Morning, Ellie.
Oh, come on.

03:53.420 --> 03:55.420
I'll tell you
which senior police officer

03:55.459 --> 03:58.059
was seen perusing the ladies
of Mill Road last night.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.779
William Davenport, Ellie Harding.

03:59.820 --> 04:01.779
Ellie writes for The Echo.

04:01.820 --> 04:03.420
Seems to think
I'm a free source of news.

04:03.459 --> 04:05.580
And cigarettes.

04:06.899 --> 04:10.219
Hi. Ah. He's better-looking
than the rest of your boys.

04:10.260 --> 04:12.380
I wouldn't bother. He's celibate.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.219
Thanks.
Oh, you're that Will.

04:14.260 --> 04:15.860
Should change your name to Won't.

04:19.260 --> 04:22.540
Boss. We need you.
Not you.

04:22.579 --> 04:26.020
Oh. So you take a vicar
but not a journalist?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.499
Judging by what she's wearing,

04:36.540 --> 04:38.540
she was a guest at the ball
last night.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.259
Porters found her first thing.

04:42.300 --> 04:46.499
They say sometimes students jump
off the bridge to show off.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.660
If she were showing off,
there'd be witnesses.

05:10.220 --> 05:11.739
Excuse me?

05:15.300 --> 05:17.780
Oi! Police!

05:18.819 --> 05:20.420
This is part of Linley College.

05:20.460 --> 05:23.100
Probably don't wanna admit
they spent the night with boys.

05:26.220 --> 05:27.980
Jess.
Miss, Miss.

05:28.020 --> 05:29.499
Jess?
Can't come down here.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.340
That's my friend, she's my friend.

05:33.220 --> 05:36.660
Jess.
WOMAN GASPING

05:49.540 --> 05:50.939
DOG BARKING

05:50.980 --> 05:54.660
Hello, Dickens. Hello.
HE CHUCKLES

05:54.699 --> 05:56.699
Oh, I've missed you.

05:56.739 --> 05:58.860
Oh. There you are!

05:58.900 --> 06:01.420
How was Bognor?

06:01.460 --> 06:02.939
You've had the sun, then.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.860
It was very temperate.

06:10.499 --> 06:12.499
I've got you some...

06:14.420 --> 06:19.739
..dates and this is argan oil.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.980
It's supposed to be very good
for your skin.

06:24.499 --> 06:26.780
From Bognor?

06:26.819 --> 06:28.939
And some slippers for Will.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.379
Bognor Regis?

06:32.900 --> 06:34.619
Mm-hm.

06:36.259 --> 06:38.259
Well...
HE SIGHS

06:45.379 --> 06:48.259
We were drinking and...

06:50.780 --> 06:53.460
..dancing and talking to boys
together.

06:53.499 --> 06:56.460
But then I went to the lavatory
and when I came back, she'd gone.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.660
I just assumed
she'd gone back to Newnham.

06:58.699 --> 07:01.819
When I got there around 11,
she hadn't signed in.

07:02.860 --> 07:04.699
When she wasn't there
this morning...

07:04.739 --> 07:07.579
Was there anyone else there
she was talking to?

07:07.619 --> 07:11.619
There were some other girls
from our college.

07:13.619 --> 07:15.619
And these boys
you were dancing with?

07:15.660 --> 07:16.819
SHE EXHALES

07:16.860 --> 07:18.540
It was a ball,
there were hundreds of them.

07:22.220 --> 07:24.220
You don't think one of them...

07:24.259 --> 07:26.179
We're just trying to establish
what happened.

07:26.220 --> 07:29.860
You know, we won't know anything
until after... the post-mortem.

07:33.139 --> 07:35.499
What was Jessica's mood like?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.020
The last time you saw her.

07:38.059 --> 07:43.139
Good. I mean, she could get
a little maudlin when drunk.

07:43.179 --> 07:44.939
Maudlin about what?

07:46.540 --> 07:49.420
It can be quite difficult
to fit in here.

07:49.460 --> 07:53.340
Especially at big functions,
where everyone knows everyone else.

07:53.379 --> 07:54.499
How do you act?

07:54.540 --> 07:56.900
But not last night.
Last night she was happy.

07:56.939 --> 07:59.460
It was fun, I think.

07:59.499 --> 08:01.100
So, when you say
you were drinking...

08:02.540 --> 08:04.540
..how drunk
do you think Jessica was?

08:05.860 --> 08:09.259
We're not used to
drinking champagne and...

08:11.420 --> 08:13.420
..these boys are so generous,
they do top you up.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.179
All right. Thank you, Miss, er...?

08:18.220 --> 08:20.579
Fitzpatrick. Vronky.

08:20.619 --> 08:23.259
It's short for Veronica.

08:24.340 --> 08:27.300
If we have any more questions,
we'll be in touch.

08:30.020 --> 08:31.139
Bye.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.339
HE SIGHS

08:36.380 --> 08:38.938
I don't suppose you fancy
a post-mortem on a hangover.

08:38.979 --> 08:41.219
It's the third weekend of the month.
Eh?

08:41.260 --> 08:44.020
Lunch with Mum.
Oh.

08:45.260 --> 08:49.099
Well, it's east-facing,
so the sun does come in first thing

08:49.140 --> 08:51.380
and the curtains are rather thin.

08:51.420 --> 08:53.099
We can always replace the curtains.

08:53.140 --> 08:56.099
And the upstairs neighbours
walk about like elephants.

08:56.140 --> 08:58.780
A lady does like to live
in the manner

08:58.819 --> 09:00.699
to which she's accustomed,
doesn't one?

09:04.900 --> 09:06.300
How was your holiday, Leonard?

09:06.339 --> 09:10.219
Oh, it was... paradise.

09:10.260 --> 09:12.939
There. What about a week away?
That might cheer you up.

09:12.979 --> 09:15.620
Have you ever tried
the English riviera?

09:16.859 --> 09:21.059
Bognor.
I don't need cheering up.

09:21.099 --> 09:23.459
You were complaining again.
I was making conversation.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.740
Mum, you have money,
a flat in Chelsea.

09:25.780 --> 09:27.620
This is your chance
to build the life you want.

09:27.660 --> 09:28.859
I have the life I want.

09:28.900 --> 09:29.979
I saw a dead girl today

09:30.020 --> 09:31.579
who will never have
that opportunity.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.099
Well, I can't compete with that.

09:33.140 --> 09:35.260
I'm not asking you to compete.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.819
I just want you to try.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.420
More shepherd's pie, anyone?

09:43.459 --> 09:44.660
No, thank you, Sylvia.

09:44.699 --> 09:48.459
It was delicious,
but I've had quite enough.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.620
Mum, I'm... Would you be so kind
as to telephone for a taxi?

10:03.660 --> 10:05.819
That's the contents of her handbag.

10:15.420 --> 10:17.579
Get these tested,
see where they're from.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.099
Yes, boss.

10:20.660 --> 10:22.459
She was wearing that
under her dress.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.179
A garter.

10:24.219 --> 10:26.740
She didn't sound like the type.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.579
Pathologist said cause of death
was a blow to the side of her head.

10:29.620 --> 10:32.859
She could've hit it on a rock
at the bottom of the river.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.900
He said there was no water
in her lungs.

10:36.979 --> 10:40.459
But that means she was dead
before she went into the water.

10:47.539 --> 10:49.539
GRUNTING

10:52.379 --> 10:54.578
Come on, knees up, no slacking.

10:54.619 --> 10:56.578
All right, straight in.
20 press-ups.

10:56.619 --> 10:58.818
Chest to the floor.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.739
Come on, you too, Vicar.
Show 'em how it's done.

11:00.779 --> 11:03.178
I'm busy losing to this bag.

11:03.218 --> 11:04.818
You all right?

11:05.938 --> 11:08.499
Ah, you know, the world.

11:08.539 --> 11:11.298
Hey, it's a beautiful place.
Don't let anyone tell you different.

11:13.619 --> 11:15.218
Here he is!

11:15.259 --> 11:17.578
You got any fresh blood for me,
Keatsy?

11:17.619 --> 11:19.019
No, not this time, Vic.

11:19.058 --> 11:20.178
Well, it's no wonder, is it?

11:20.218 --> 11:21.739
In that shape
you'll never catch 'em.

11:25.058 --> 11:27.058
Hey, there's someone
wants a word with ya.

11:27.098 --> 11:28.979
Hey, Luke.

11:29.019 --> 11:32.298
Hey. I never said stop, did I?
Go on, carry on.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.659
Right. What do you wanna say
to the inspector?

11:35.698 --> 11:37.298
I'm sorry for stealing them bikes.

11:37.338 --> 11:40.938
And thank you for sending me here
instead of prison.

11:40.979 --> 11:42.619
Wasn't my choice, son.

11:42.659 --> 11:44.539
You can thank my chief constable
for that.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.739
But I'm glad to see
you're enjoying it.

11:46.779 --> 11:48.938
Wanna see him spar?
Never gives up, this one.

11:48.979 --> 11:50.698
It's Will I need to see, actually.

11:50.739 --> 11:52.418
What's he done this time?

11:52.458 --> 11:55.739
I need his help...
with a murder investigation.

11:59.379 --> 12:01.619
And how come
he's always so bloody cheerful?

12:01.659 --> 12:03.659
Vic's Victors.

12:04.739 --> 12:06.499
Too many punches to the head,
if you ask me.

12:06.539 --> 12:08.899
Oh, come on.
It's gotta be better than Borstal.

12:08.938 --> 12:12.458
Hard work, discipline, a chance
to make something of themselves.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.779
Yeah. Tougher criminals.
FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING

12:14.818 --> 12:16.979
Inspector.
Principal Shaw.

12:17.019 --> 12:18.418
Andrea, please.

12:18.458 --> 12:20.058
Mr William Davenport.

12:20.098 --> 12:21.938
He was there
when we first discovered the body

12:21.979 --> 12:23.619
and he's assisting with our inquiry.

12:23.659 --> 12:26.259
I'm sorry about Jessica.
Indeed.

12:26.298 --> 12:28.899
However, with not one
but two pillars

12:28.938 --> 12:31.698
of the patriarchy in attendance,
state and church,

12:31.739 --> 12:33.899
I'm sure we'll soon get
to the bottom of this.

12:36.578 --> 12:38.178
This is why I need you here.

12:38.218 --> 12:40.218
Feel free to translate.

12:54.218 --> 12:56.139
You ever wonder
what a girl feels like

12:56.178 --> 12:57.739
walking past a building site?

12:57.779 --> 13:00.539
Not really.
Well, now you know.

13:00.578 --> 13:03.698
Jessica Hall was a model student.

13:03.739 --> 13:07.139
Were you aware of any disagreements
or quarrels Jessica was having?

13:07.178 --> 13:09.178
Perhaps with the other girls.

13:09.218 --> 13:12.218
Oh, that's rather a tired old trope,
don't you think, Inspector?

13:12.259 --> 13:14.578
High-achieving women
keeping each other in their place

13:14.619 --> 13:17.739
isn't something we encourage
or tolerate at Newnham.

13:18.779 --> 13:20.058
That's a no.

13:20.098 --> 13:23.659
Was she the type to have boyfriends?

13:23.698 --> 13:26.259
Male acquaintances?
The type?

13:27.298 --> 13:30.418
Well, the inspector's just trying to
build a picture of Jessica's life.

13:30.458 --> 13:33.818
Well, we don't tend to have men
on college grounds,

13:33.859 --> 13:36.139
so I wouldn't know.

13:38.698 --> 13:40.979
Please excuse the disarray.

13:41.019 --> 13:44.178
Jessica's death will cast a shadow
over our college ball tomorrow,

13:44.218 --> 13:46.578
but we'll now hold it in her honour.

13:46.619 --> 13:47.659
I would've thought a ball

13:47.698 --> 13:49.539
was a patriarchal tradition
for your tastes.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.058
Not the way we're doing it.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.578
There'll be an all-female band,
speakers

13:53.619 --> 13:56.218
and, of course, it'll be the girls
asking the boys to dance,

13:56.259 --> 13:58.019
rather than the other way round.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.259
Lock up your sons.

14:04.259 --> 14:07.539
These are the girls who attended
the Linley ball last night.

14:10.218 --> 14:13.379
We saw you at the scene
this morning.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.659
We called to you,
but you didn't stop.

14:15.698 --> 14:17.259
Must've been some other girls.

14:17.298 --> 14:19.298
Of course we would've stopped
for poor Jessica.

14:19.338 --> 14:21.899
We're investigating the murder
of one of your friends.

14:21.938 --> 14:25.139
Murder?
I would appreciate some cooperation.

14:25.178 --> 14:27.899
Heather and her friends signed back
in to the college before curfew.

14:27.938 --> 14:29.058
See here?

14:29.098 --> 14:31.698
I specifically requested this
from the porter's lodge.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.379
These are all
in the same handwriting.

14:35.418 --> 14:36.698
I signed in for all of us.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.139
And are there any witnesses

14:43.178 --> 14:44.938
who can verify
the times written here?

14:44.979 --> 14:48.019
A night porter's on hand
for any disturbances,

14:48.058 --> 14:50.379
but we trust our students,
Inspector.

14:50.418 --> 14:52.619
Newnham girls know how to behave.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.899
Perhaps we could take a look
at Jessica's room.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.139
Alone.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.458
The girls can't say they were out
all night in front of the principal.

15:11.259 --> 15:12.458
Hello?

15:14.659 --> 15:16.818
See? Proves my point.

15:16.859 --> 15:19.019
They do it in case
the night porter does the rounds.

15:20.578 --> 15:21.979
So she WAS the type.

15:22.019 --> 15:23.499
What does that even mean?

15:23.539 --> 15:25.458
I used to do it.
Exactly.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.779
WILL EXHALES

15:36.098 --> 15:38.098
Geordie.
Mm-hm.

15:39.298 --> 15:41.499
Bennies. Pep-up pills.

15:41.539 --> 15:43.779
Yeah, I know what Benzedrine is.

15:46.019 --> 15:47.418
How do you?

15:48.619 --> 15:50.979
Well, people do them
at rock 'n' roll nights.

15:52.899 --> 15:54.379
I've heard.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.539
So she was taking uppers.

15:58.578 --> 16:01.938
Out all night.
And she's not the only one.

16:01.979 --> 16:04.139
We could try
and speak to the girls separately.

16:04.178 --> 16:06.098
Try and piece together her movements
from there.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.979
Between drink, pills
and covering for each other?

16:09.019 --> 16:11.298
I doubt we're gonna get
anything concrete.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.019
Unless...

16:19.298 --> 16:21.859
We got the film
from the official photographer.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.619
Survivors' photograph.

16:23.659 --> 16:25.818
They take it at the end of the ball,

16:25.859 --> 16:27.859
to prove you made it
through the night.

16:30.058 --> 16:33.379
I didn't think you could be seen
around here.

16:33.418 --> 16:35.539
Shame about the circumstances.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.859
GEORDIE CLEARS THROAT
It's not that dark in here.

16:46.379 --> 16:47.619
Et voila.

16:49.499 --> 16:51.139
There's Jessica.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.458
And Vronky.

16:53.499 --> 16:55.659
She said she was back at Newnham
by 11.

16:55.698 --> 16:58.338
Those boys look fairly familiar
with them, too.

17:03.338 --> 17:06.058
Geordie.
No comment yet, Ellie.

17:06.098 --> 17:08.259
Is it true the girl's body
was found decapitated?

17:08.298 --> 17:11.019
She wasn't decapitated.
Ah, so a girl was found dead.

17:11.058 --> 17:13.219
Schoolboy error.
Who was she, then?

17:13.259 --> 17:15.058
Drunk posh girl
who met the wrong bloke?

17:15.098 --> 17:16.897
She was a young woman
trying to enjoy herself

17:16.939 --> 17:18.219
and make something of her life.

17:18.259 --> 17:20.019
Well, aren't we all?
WILL SCOFFS

17:20.058 --> 17:22.338
If spreading malicious gossip's
how you enjoy yourself,

17:22.377 --> 17:24.539
you might wanna have another look
at your life.

17:24.578 --> 17:26.818
Well, at least I make
my own stuff up for a living,

17:26.858 --> 17:29.019
rather than spouting rubbish
from some old book.

17:29.058 --> 17:31.898
Come on. You've got work to do.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.259
How can anyone be that callous?

17:45.298 --> 17:48.098
Journos are always like that.

17:48.138 --> 17:50.138
They see enough darkness,
they get used to it.

17:50.179 --> 17:51.979
So do you. So do I.

17:52.019 --> 17:54.419
At least we're trying
to make the world better, not worse.

17:56.338 --> 17:58.858
I'll cancel the double date
with her and Cathy, then, shall I?

17:58.898 --> 18:01.338
STRAINING NOISES

18:02.459 --> 18:04.459
MAN: Help!

18:09.259 --> 18:11.618
PANTING
What's going on?

18:11.658 --> 18:13.779
STRAINING

18:13.818 --> 18:15.378
Oi!

18:23.298 --> 18:25.979
I saw you at Newnham this morning.
Won't be hard to trace you.

18:26.019 --> 18:28.138
We just wanna talk.

18:28.179 --> 18:29.779
It's them boys
you should be talking to.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.939
We will. OK? Hmm?

18:31.979 --> 18:34.138
Just hold him there.
Wait.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.338
WILL GRUNTS
Oi!

18:35.378 --> 18:37.539
WILL GROANS

18:39.019 --> 18:41.179
You all right?
Yeah.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.499
Well, I see the boxing training
came in handy (!)

18:46.098 --> 18:47.298
We don't know him.

18:47.338 --> 18:50.419
He burst in accusing us of killing
that girl found in the river.

18:50.459 --> 18:53.298
And did ya?
Of course not.

18:53.338 --> 18:55.578
She and her friend came back here

18:55.618 --> 18:57.259
to listen to some music
after the ball.

18:57.298 --> 19:00.699
Wagner.
But nothing happened. She left.

19:00.739 --> 19:03.419
Probably to lead on
some other poor sod.

19:03.459 --> 19:05.058
WILL SCOFFS

19:05.098 --> 19:06.739
Will.
I'd say that's a motive.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.658
Steady on.

19:08.699 --> 19:11.019
When a chap's been led to believe
he's on a promise,

19:11.058 --> 19:13.179
I think he is entitled

19:13.219 --> 19:15.219
to feel a bit disappointed
when he's let down.

19:15.259 --> 19:17.898
Disappointed enough to kill?
Don't be ridiculous.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.419
We're very sorry
to hear about this young lady.

19:20.459 --> 19:24.979
But if these girls want
to gang together and act like boys,

19:25.019 --> 19:27.179
they need to learn
to behave like us.

19:27.219 --> 19:30.019
Here, here.
Gang together?

19:30.058 --> 19:31.979
The Berserkers?

19:32.019 --> 19:34.939
College drinking society.

19:34.979 --> 19:37.898
You're saying the girls
had a club of their own?

19:37.939 --> 19:40.098
The Newnham Valkyries,
they call themselves.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.019
Might as well have been
the Newnham Virgins,

19:42.058 --> 19:43.618
as far as she was concerned.

19:43.658 --> 19:45.298
Her name was Jessica.

19:48.098 --> 19:50.098
Did anyone else see her leave?

19:51.539 --> 19:54.019
What was it, Franky? Fronky?

19:54.058 --> 19:55.858
Now that's who Wagner had in mind

19:55.898 --> 19:58.739
when he composed
The Ride Of The Valkyries.

19:58.779 --> 20:00.658
BOTH CHUCKLE

20:05.138 --> 20:08.098
I just didn't want you
to think I was easy.

20:08.138 --> 20:10.138
We're not here to judge.

20:10.179 --> 20:12.338
Everything else I told you was true,
except I...

20:13.378 --> 20:15.019
..pulled the timings forward.

20:15.058 --> 20:19.259
After Jess left me with the boys
for maybe 20 minutes, half an hour,

20:19.298 --> 20:21.098
I went to look for her,
but I couldn't find her,

20:21.138 --> 20:24.419
so I came back to the college,
around 5:00am.

20:24.459 --> 20:26.179
But the others stayed out.

20:26.219 --> 20:30.739
So this... is your handwriting.

20:31.779 --> 20:33.058
That was the rule.

20:33.098 --> 20:34.818
First one back
signs everyone else in.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.618
I think Heather
was just covering for me

20:36.658 --> 20:38.338
when she said it was her.

20:38.378 --> 20:40.618
The rule?
Of The Valkyries.

20:43.858 --> 20:45.179
Recognise the college colours?

20:45.219 --> 20:47.459
It's nothing bad,
it's just a society.

20:47.499 --> 20:50.098
You get invited
to all the best parties,

20:50.138 --> 20:51.779
you meet the nicest men.

20:51.818 --> 20:53.979
At least you're looking out
for each other.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.699
You knew about this?

20:55.739 --> 20:58.858
Do you know how many female colleges
there are in Cambridge, Inspector?

20:58.898 --> 21:01.219
Three.
Out of 25.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.259
Men have been forming clubs
like this for centuries.

21:04.298 --> 21:06.459
We've only been allowed
degrees for a decade.

21:06.499 --> 21:09.019
So, I think it's only right
that these women,

21:09.058 --> 21:12.179
who are going to be at the top
of their fields one day,

21:12.219 --> 21:14.179
forge the networks
that will carry them

21:14.219 --> 21:16.219
into the working world
of the future.

21:16.259 --> 21:18.058
Don't you?

21:19.818 --> 21:22.338
Not if it means they obstruct
a murder inquiry, no.

21:22.378 --> 21:25.818
There is nothing connecting
The Valkyries to Jessica's death.

21:25.858 --> 21:28.378
They've already lied about
where they all were last night.

21:28.419 --> 21:30.419
For fear of being labelled 'easy'.

21:31.618 --> 21:36.618
Which is nothing to be ashamed of
if it's your own choice, Veronika.

21:39.858 --> 21:41.658
The Valkyries are a sisterhood.

21:41.699 --> 21:43.338
No-one would hurt Jess.

21:44.658 --> 21:47.058
Why didn't you sign her in
with everyone else?

21:48.298 --> 21:50.578
She wasn't a full member yet.

21:50.618 --> 21:52.179
Neither am I.

21:53.898 --> 21:55.219
And how do you become one?

21:55.259 --> 21:57.259
They leave a red rose on your door.

21:58.419 --> 22:00.858
You go out to the garden
to be sworn in by candlelight.

22:00.898 --> 22:03.939
Every society needs its initiations,
Inspector.

22:03.979 --> 22:05.979
Better than downing ten pints

22:06.019 --> 22:09.378
and urinating into letterboxes,
wouldn't you say?

22:09.419 --> 22:12.818
This is the catering company
that provides our event staff.

22:14.739 --> 22:16.578
I hope you can find
your mystery attacker.

22:19.499 --> 22:22.699
What is the world coming to, hmm?

22:22.739 --> 22:26.779
Female drinking societies.
That's the last thing I need.

22:26.818 --> 22:28.539
The boys are bad enough.

22:30.979 --> 22:32.979
Don't tell me you were in one.

22:33.019 --> 22:34.499
The Conquerors.

22:34.539 --> 22:37.378
Oh, yeah? And what did you conquer?

22:37.419 --> 22:39.058
Ourselves, mostly.

22:39.098 --> 22:41.499
Ten pints and urinating
in letterboxes.

22:41.539 --> 22:44.058
I know, I know, it's pathetic.

22:44.098 --> 22:47.098
I just suppose you wanna feel
part of something at that age.

22:48.138 --> 22:50.138
What's wrong
with National Service, Will?

22:53.179 --> 22:55.138
It's those girls again.

23:08.818 --> 23:10.818
INDISTINCT WHISPERING

23:14.179 --> 23:15.539
What's going on?

23:15.578 --> 23:18.898
We're picking flowers to make
corsages for the ball tomorrow.

23:26.298 --> 23:29.298
What's that? Buried treasure?

23:34.807 --> 23:36.807
They all belong
to our ex-boyfriends.

23:36.847 --> 23:38.968
Just saying goodbye before the ball.

23:39.008 --> 23:41.168
Out with the old, in with the new.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.408
Are you not trying
to destroy evidence?

23:43.448 --> 23:45.168
Of what? Young love?

23:47.768 --> 23:49.327
Were these an ex-boyfriend's?

23:49.367 --> 23:51.807
I thought they were headache pills,
but they made me feel ill.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.488
Where did you get them from?

23:54.768 --> 23:55.968
From Jessica.

23:56.008 --> 23:57.688
The one girl
that can't defend herself.

23:57.728 --> 23:59.567
You may think that
she was sweet and innocent,

23:59.607 --> 24:01.327
but Jessica knew
how to have a good time.

24:01.367 --> 24:04.047
She wasn't as discerning
as the rest of us.

24:04.087 --> 24:06.768
Especially when it came to men.

24:06.807 --> 24:08.968
Probably why she ended up
the way she did.

24:09.008 --> 24:10.528
What's that supposed to mean?

24:10.567 --> 24:12.367
Well, if you go
for a bit of rough...

24:13.408 --> 24:15.567
..you can't be surprised
if you're treated roughly.

24:15.607 --> 24:17.087
SOFT CHUCKLING

24:22.847 --> 24:24.847
So, why did you attack
the boys at Linley?

24:24.887 --> 24:26.248
They was all over Jess at the ball,

24:26.287 --> 24:28.448
I thought they must have been
the ones that hurt her.

24:28.488 --> 24:31.287
You weren't trying to push the blame
onto them for something you'd done?

24:31.327 --> 24:34.887
No. I liked her.

24:34.928 --> 24:37.408
How did you know Jessica?

24:37.448 --> 24:39.567
Served her at a couple of events.

24:39.607 --> 24:41.248
Dinners, balls.

24:41.287 --> 24:43.768
What, you serve a girl at dinner

24:43.807 --> 24:45.607
and now you're looking
to avenge her death?

24:47.847 --> 24:50.647
One of the girls said you might have
had something more with Jessica.

24:50.688 --> 24:52.528
Those girls are a bunch of gossips.

24:52.567 --> 24:55.367
Jess wasn't like that.
No, she was nice.

24:58.887 --> 25:00.408
You know I could have you
for assault?

25:02.127 --> 25:04.287
Won't be the first time.

25:05.448 --> 25:07.847
Listen, the boys
aren't pressing charges.

25:07.887 --> 25:10.327
They don't wanna admit
they were beaten up by a waiter.

25:10.367 --> 25:11.968
Neither do I.

25:12.008 --> 25:13.728
You've got a decent right hook.

25:13.768 --> 25:14.968
My dad boxed.

25:15.008 --> 25:16.528
Does he train you?

25:16.567 --> 25:18.688
He's dead.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.047
Sorry.

25:23.567 --> 25:27.008
Matthew... are you sure
there is nothing else

25:27.047 --> 25:28.488
you can tell us about Jessica?

25:28.528 --> 25:31.768
So we can get justice for her,
instead of misplaced revenge.

25:40.928 --> 25:44.008
He's holding something back.
I know it.

25:44.047 --> 25:47.768
Agreed. I do think
he genuinely cares for her.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.127
More than
her so-called friends do, anyway.

25:52.008 --> 25:54.688
What about the principal?
Have you been listening?

25:54.728 --> 25:56.887
Well, the dead girl's
from Newnham, right?

25:56.928 --> 25:58.807
How do you know that?
I've got my sources.

25:58.847 --> 25:59.968
Bloody Larry.

26:00.008 --> 26:01.408
So, before she was at Newnham,

26:01.448 --> 26:04.408
Andrea Shaw was a senior fellow
at Edinburgh,

26:04.448 --> 26:05.968
but missed out on a promotion

26:06.008 --> 26:08.528
to a colleague
more than five years her junior.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.168
A bloke, of course.
So?

26:11.208 --> 26:15.968
So... she slashed his tyres.
Allegedly.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.448
How does that connect to Jessica?

26:17.488 --> 26:19.448
Jessica.
Sorry.

26:19.488 --> 26:23.127
I don't know, but background's
always useful, isn't it?

26:23.168 --> 26:26.047
Cin-cin.
Thank you, Ellie.

26:26.087 --> 26:28.768
Another suspect.
Oh.

26:28.807 --> 26:30.928
Who are the others?

26:32.528 --> 26:33.728
Nice try.

26:35.887 --> 26:39.008
There's a ball at Newnham tomorrow,
isn't there?

26:39.047 --> 26:42.168
So, when I'm stuck,
I try and get on the ground.

26:42.208 --> 26:44.327
Immerse myself in the story.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.087
If either of you need a date...

26:47.607 --> 26:48.968
That's not a bad idea.

26:50.607 --> 26:52.768
No.
Fine.

26:52.807 --> 26:54.928
Ugly sisters, you go to the ball.

26:54.968 --> 26:58.647
But remember who thought of it when
you're doling out the exclusives.

27:05.408 --> 27:07.567
BOY: Let go!
Go to bed!

27:07.607 --> 27:11.567
Have you seen my dinner jacket?
Oh, try the dressing up box.

27:15.647 --> 27:20.087
Dora? Eh, you couldn't run
an iron over it, could ya?

27:20.127 --> 27:22.448
I told you,
I've got a union meeting tonight.

27:22.488 --> 27:24.488
What, another one?
SHE SIGHS

27:24.528 --> 27:27.087
Well, we could always bring
my mum in for reinforcements.

27:27.127 --> 27:28.488
While we're stretched.

27:28.528 --> 27:31.087
It's not that bad.
Exactly.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.528
CHILDREN CONTINUE SHOUTING

27:33.567 --> 27:36.208
Dora!
There you go, then. Have it.

27:39.887 --> 27:42.008
Ding-dong!

27:45.248 --> 27:47.008
It's Leslie Phillips.

27:47.047 --> 27:50.047
Well, I think you look
very handsome.

27:52.248 --> 27:53.768
Your mother would be very proud.

27:54.968 --> 27:56.488
Thank you.

27:58.047 --> 28:00.647
Have you had a chance
to speak to her yet?

28:00.688 --> 28:02.408
Since the other day.

28:02.448 --> 28:04.127
I'm sure she's fine.

28:04.168 --> 28:06.168
I know you just want her
to be happy, Will,

28:06.208 --> 28:08.887
but it's not always that easy.

28:08.928 --> 28:11.607
She's got everything she needs
to live the life she wants.

28:11.647 --> 28:14.248
You know, in Morocco...

28:15.768 --> 28:19.968
..it's not uncommon for male friends
to hold hands in public.

28:20.968 --> 28:25.448
Nobody looks, nobody points or...
locks you up.

28:25.488 --> 28:31.327
You can just walk,
hand-in-hand... in the street.

28:33.567 --> 28:34.968
But here...

28:36.127 --> 28:39.087
Some people aren't allowed to live
the lives they want.

28:42.728 --> 28:44.448
Some can't.

28:47.488 --> 28:49.287
Well, Mum's not one of them.

28:49.327 --> 28:51.647
She just needs to get on with it.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.327
But thanks.

28:55.047 --> 28:56.968
# And still you tell me

28:57.008 --> 29:00.688
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

29:02.567 --> 29:04.208
# If you don't make
Your mind up... #

29:04.248 --> 29:06.408
I always wondered
what these things were like.

29:07.448 --> 29:09.448
Pleased to see my taxes
are being well spent.

29:09.488 --> 29:11.488
I told you they're ridiculous.

29:11.528 --> 29:13.008
If they saved half this money,

29:13.047 --> 29:15.047
they could double
the amount of scholarships.

29:16.408 --> 29:18.968
It is nice, though.
I know.

29:19.008 --> 29:22.488
It's like Eden.
Gentlemen.

29:25.728 --> 29:26.847
Thank you.

29:26.887 --> 29:29.367
# Confess but please don't tell me

29:29.408 --> 29:32.647
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps... #

29:36.847 --> 29:38.047
So, how do you wanna play this?

29:38.087 --> 29:39.607
Hmm. Just mingle.

29:40.688 --> 29:43.528
Look out for anything suspicious.
Them.

29:44.887 --> 29:47.087
Any bullying from the girls.

29:47.127 --> 29:48.567
Oh, and pills.

29:48.607 --> 29:50.728
Larry had them tested.

29:50.768 --> 29:53.327
American Benzedrine.

29:53.367 --> 29:54.688
Imported.

29:57.847 --> 30:00.847
Will. Wait.

30:03.847 --> 30:04.928
It's a drinking game.

30:04.968 --> 30:08.047
You get penny-ed,
you have to down the drink.

30:08.087 --> 30:10.528
Oh, you can keep that. As a tip.

30:10.567 --> 30:13.248
# We'll never get started

30:13.287 --> 30:14.607
# Sha-la-la-la-la

30:14.647 --> 30:16.607
# I don't wanna wind up
# Sha-la-la-la

30:16.647 --> 30:19.807
# Being parted, broken-hearted... #

30:19.847 --> 30:22.287
Would you like to dance, Vicar?

30:24.008 --> 30:25.367
That's a nice way to talk.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.168
Besides, you're celibate.

30:27.208 --> 30:29.928
Really?
Will you stop opening with that?

30:29.968 --> 30:31.968
What about you, Inspector?

30:32.008 --> 30:33.807
I'm celibate too.

30:33.847 --> 30:35.728
I didn't have you down
as the religious type.

30:35.768 --> 30:37.168
I'm not, I'm married.

30:38.607 --> 30:41.287
# So if you really love me

30:41.327 --> 30:43.008
# Say yes

30:43.047 --> 30:47.047
# And if you don't dear confess

30:47.087 --> 30:48.847
# But please don't tell me

30:48.887 --> 30:51.968
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

30:53.367 --> 30:56.807
# Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps

30:56.847 --> 30:59.567
# Perhaps, perhaps

31:00.607 --> 31:04.488
# Perhaps. #

31:04.528 --> 31:06.528
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

31:08.127 --> 31:09.768
# Pah-rah-rah-rah-rah

31:09.807 --> 31:13.248
# Pah-rah-rah-dun

31:13.287 --> 31:15.847
# Pah-pah-pah-rah-dah-rah... #

31:15.887 --> 31:18.488
I didn't think you had to be
celibate in the Church of England.

31:19.647 --> 31:23.408
You don't. I'm just waiting for
the right person at the right time.

31:26.327 --> 31:29.807
# I'm in the mood for love

31:31.087 --> 31:34.528
# Simply because you're near me... #

31:36.327 --> 31:39.008
Ma'am?
Inspector.

31:39.047 --> 31:42.607
I heard you were here.
Any news on the case?

31:42.647 --> 31:44.807
Can you show me
what's in your hand, please?

31:44.847 --> 31:48.248
I don't see
it's any of your business.

31:48.287 --> 31:50.607
I have reason to believe
you may be distributing drugs,

31:50.647 --> 31:53.528
which could be linked to the death
of one of your students.

31:53.567 --> 31:57.728
Drugs? Prophylactics.

31:58.807 --> 32:00.248
I can't stop these girls having sex,

32:00.287 --> 32:02.768
but I can encourage them
to take precautions

32:02.807 --> 32:04.807
and to consider their futures.

32:07.008 --> 32:11.847
# This little dream
# This little dream... #

32:11.887 --> 32:14.448
I know what it's like,
trying to fit in here.

32:14.488 --> 32:16.488
Especially if it's strict at home.

32:16.528 --> 32:17.847
You get carried away.

32:17.887 --> 32:21.168
Obviously, Jessica had a line
she wouldn't cross.

32:21.208 --> 32:24.647
She did.
What was she really like, Vronky?

32:24.688 --> 32:29.887
I mean, so far we've got pills,
garters, rumours about boys.

32:31.688 --> 32:32.807
She was good.

32:32.847 --> 32:34.448
I don't think any of this
is down to her.

32:38.768 --> 32:44.647
Vicar. There's someone
in Jess' room. There.

32:51.208 --> 32:52.887
DOOR SQUEAKS

32:54.567 --> 32:55.887
Matthew, what are you doing?

32:55.928 --> 32:58.528
Hey!
Get off me!

33:02.168 --> 33:04.728
What's this?
It was my dad's.

33:04.768 --> 33:07.087
What was it doing in Jessica's room?
Hmm?

33:16.301 --> 33:19.101
You told us you'd only met Jessica
a handful of times.

33:19.142 --> 33:21.142
But you'd been in her room.

33:21.182 --> 33:24.142
They made us.
Who?

33:25.222 --> 33:26.902
The girls.

33:26.942 --> 33:28.942
They made us go into her room.

33:29.982 --> 33:32.261
For what?
What do you think?

33:34.462 --> 33:36.222
But we didn't.

33:36.261 --> 33:38.861
Jess said she didn't want to,
so we didn't do anything at all.

33:38.902 --> 33:41.781
Why were they so desperate
for you to do it in the first place?

33:43.541 --> 33:45.902
That's how they qualify
to join The Valkyries.

33:47.902 --> 33:51.222
Sleep with boys, collect trophies.

33:51.261 --> 33:53.261
It's what they were trying to bury.

33:53.301 --> 33:55.462
I don't know why
she wanted to join 'em.

33:55.501 --> 33:56.702
But she did.

33:56.742 --> 33:58.462
That's why I gave her the cufflink,

33:58.501 --> 34:00.901
so she could say
that we'd been together.

34:00.941 --> 34:03.542
What is this? American?

34:03.582 --> 34:04.941
My dad was a GI.

34:04.981 --> 34:06.981
Stationed at Bassingbourn.

34:07.022 --> 34:08.742
He died at Normandy.

34:08.781 --> 34:10.781
Why should we believe you?

34:10.821 --> 34:13.022
I mean, why would you even
go along with them?

34:13.062 --> 34:15.222
Forcing you into her room.

34:18.581 --> 34:20.821
They said they'd stitch me up
if I didn't.

34:22.742 --> 34:24.022
Stitch you up for what?

34:25.222 --> 34:26.821
The bennies.

34:26.860 --> 34:28.981
You got them from the American base.

34:33.981 --> 34:37.022
Some of my dad's pals,
they settled here after the war.

34:38.380 --> 34:40.380
They get them from the States.

34:41.702 --> 34:42.900
I gave a few to Jess,

34:42.940 --> 34:46.022
she said she wanted something
to help her stay up late, to study.

34:46.062 --> 34:48.621
But then the rest of them found out
and they wanted them too.

34:48.661 --> 34:50.981
So you broke into her room
to cover your tracks.

34:51.022 --> 34:54.742
No. No, I wanted the cufflink back.

34:55.900 --> 34:58.261
So that no-one thought Jess
was something that she wasn't.

35:01.421 --> 35:03.421
She was a nice girl.

35:05.461 --> 35:07.461
Not like the rest.

35:09.142 --> 35:12.742
The Valkyries are supposed to be
about sisterhood.

35:12.781 --> 35:17.662
Empowerment, not tawdry fumbles
for trinkets and cufflinks.

35:17.702 --> 35:21.502
So, what, girls have to
sleep with 10, 20 boys

35:21.542 --> 35:23.662
to join your little gang?

35:23.702 --> 35:26.222
It's not just about quantity,
Inspector.

35:26.261 --> 35:29.901
A policeman wouldn't be worth
as much as a vicar, for example.

35:31.261 --> 35:34.381
I'm surprised at you, Heather.
Grow up.

35:34.421 --> 35:35.781
You grow up.

35:37.941 --> 35:42.182
I mean, all this rubbish about
connections and jobs for the girls.

35:43.421 --> 35:45.022
You only got the job here

35:45.062 --> 35:47.062
because they wouldn't have you
anywhere else.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.742
That's what it's really like.
Isn't it?

35:52.222 --> 35:53.301
Be honest.

35:53.341 --> 35:55.781
We can have degrees,
but at the end of the day,

35:55.821 --> 35:58.142
we're all gonna be someone's wife
in five years' time.

35:58.182 --> 36:03.261
Popping out kids
and organising charity lunches.

36:03.301 --> 36:05.022
No. It doesn't have to be that way.

36:05.062 --> 36:07.222
No. It doesn't have to.

36:08.582 --> 36:10.702
But it probably will be, won't it?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.461
So we may as well enjoy
this bit while we can.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.341
It doesn't mean we killed anyone.

36:24.022 --> 36:26.022
So much for Eden, then.

36:26.062 --> 36:28.662
Oh, I don't know.

36:28.702 --> 36:30.702
Maybe Heather's right.

36:30.742 --> 36:32.901
If that's all these girls
think they can hope for,

36:32.941 --> 36:36.022
then maybe parties
and tawdry fumbles

36:36.062 --> 36:39.742
and getting drunk for a few years
is some kind of Eden.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.421
Worked for me for a while.

36:42.502 --> 36:44.662
Doesn't sound that bad
when you put it like that.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.261
But it was, though.

36:46.301 --> 36:48.301
I wasn't happy.

36:48.341 --> 36:51.781
I thought I was doing it all wrong,
that I had to try harder.

36:51.821 --> 36:54.502
Anything to be part of the gang.

37:04.102 --> 37:05.582
You all right?

37:05.622 --> 37:07.062
My pocket square.

37:11.582 --> 37:13.742
KNOCKING
Vronky?

37:17.062 --> 37:18.261
Vronky?

37:44.102 --> 37:46.821
Rubbish.
You never got anywhere near him.

37:46.861 --> 37:50.542
No, it's true. It was amazing.

37:50.582 --> 37:54.421
Fine. Let's ask him. Vicar.

37:54.461 --> 37:57.461
Is it true that you broke your vow
of celibacy with Vronky here?

37:58.582 --> 38:00.582
She must have taken it
while we were dancing.

38:00.622 --> 38:02.981
Veronika, could we have a word?

38:03.022 --> 38:05.301
No, but I did other things.

38:05.341 --> 38:07.341
Oh, Ollie and Alastair
told us about that.

38:07.381 --> 38:08.622
ALL CHUCKLE

38:08.662 --> 38:10.821
Hardly the behaviour
of a Newnham lady,

38:10.861 --> 38:11.981
let alone a Valkyrie.

38:12.022 --> 38:13.502
That's not fair.
Veronika.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.341
You can't make the rules
then take them back.

38:15.381 --> 38:17.582
We need to talk to you
about Jessica's murder.

38:17.622 --> 38:20.102
Shall we go to my study?
No, I'm here with my friends.

38:25.022 --> 38:26.941
We know you want
to be part of the group

38:26.981 --> 38:29.421
and maybe you felt
that Jessica let you down

38:29.461 --> 38:32.222
by leaving you with those boys.

38:32.261 --> 38:35.182
And you were upset, ashamed.

38:35.222 --> 38:36.941
No, it was an accident.

38:36.981 --> 38:38.981
You tried to make it look like one.

38:44.421 --> 38:47.941
We... We were drunk.

38:51.261 --> 38:53.261
She left me with them.

38:55.622 --> 38:57.381
It's supposed to be a sisterhood.

38:59.301 --> 39:00.941
We're supposed to stick together,

39:00.981 --> 39:03.301
it was supposed to be a funny story,
but it wasn't.

39:05.461 --> 39:07.421
It was disgusting.

39:13.381 --> 39:16.261
I didn't mean to kill her. I just...

39:19.901 --> 39:22.022
I was just so angry.

39:22.062 --> 39:24.062
At them, at...

39:25.502 --> 39:27.821
'Jess.'
..at myself.

39:27.861 --> 39:30.142
'Jess!'
I didn't know what to do, so I...

39:36.702 --> 39:38.502
..I just threw her into the river.

39:44.742 --> 39:46.301
I'm sorry.

39:47.981 --> 39:49.582
I just...
BREATHING SHAKILY

39:50.981 --> 39:53.821
I just wanted her to feel
how I felt.

39:57.941 --> 40:00.502
I'm so sorry.

40:00.542 --> 40:03.301
Veronika Fitzpatrick.

40:03.341 --> 40:06.301
I'm arresting you
for the murder of Jessica Hall.

40:06.341 --> 40:07.662
You have the right to remain...

40:07.702 --> 40:09.421
It's those boys
you should be locking up.

40:09.461 --> 40:11.341
Veronika is a victim here too.

40:11.381 --> 40:14.261
She killed someone
and tried to cover it up.

40:14.301 --> 40:15.542
What else can I do?

40:15.582 --> 40:17.301
Vicar.

40:17.341 --> 40:19.222
The court will take everything
into account.

40:19.261 --> 40:24.142
A man in a wig judging how a young
woman might feel in that situation.

40:24.182 --> 40:26.062
That's not fair.

40:35.981 --> 40:37.582
INHALING SHARPLY

40:39.861 --> 40:42.821
Andrea's right, you know.

40:42.861 --> 40:44.222
It's not just Vronky.

40:44.261 --> 40:46.182
It's the whole thing.

40:46.222 --> 40:47.821
I know.

40:49.901 --> 40:51.901
If I had my way,
I'd lock them all up.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.261
Berserkers, Valkyries.

40:55.301 --> 40:57.622
Matthew?
He withheld evidence.

40:57.662 --> 40:59.582
I've no choice with him either.

41:02.981 --> 41:05.461
What about sending him to Vic?
That's for minor offences.

41:05.502 --> 41:07.702
This is something
much more serious, Will.

41:07.742 --> 41:10.901
What if I vouch for him? Personally.

41:10.941 --> 41:13.301
The church puts up some funding,
it should hold some sway.

41:14.421 --> 41:17.182
Geordie, he's been to Borstal,
it didn't work.

41:17.222 --> 41:18.941
Vic's Victors does.

41:18.981 --> 41:21.102
And if it doesn't, you can blame me.

41:41.461 --> 41:42.582
Thanks.
KNOCKING

41:42.622 --> 41:45.222
Oh, postman's early.
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

41:45.261 --> 41:47.182
That's not the postman.

41:52.461 --> 41:54.901
It's the cavalry.
SHE EXHALES

41:56.222 --> 41:59.102
This hallway needs a good scrub.

41:59.142 --> 42:02.182
Nana!
Oh, Esme!

42:02.222 --> 42:04.742
Mam. What are you doing here?

42:05.901 --> 42:07.341
I phoned her.

42:07.381 --> 42:09.742
There's no point
in us complaining...

42:09.781 --> 42:12.261
ME complaining about
having too much on all the time.

42:13.341 --> 42:15.341
Might as well do what we can
to fix it.

42:17.981 --> 42:19.341
You look thin, love.

42:23.182 --> 42:24.622
Problem solved.

42:36.781 --> 42:38.781
Looking good, Mum.

42:38.821 --> 42:39.821
SHE CHUCKLES

42:39.861 --> 42:43.222
Well, like you said,
it's time I made a fist of it.

42:45.381 --> 42:48.261
I'm sorry about lunch
the other week.

42:48.301 --> 42:52.502
I know things maybe aren't as easy
as I'd like them to be.

42:52.542 --> 42:55.461
They might be for you,
you're young and you're a man.

42:55.502 --> 42:57.381
Well, don't forget talented.

42:58.421 --> 43:00.582
You're happy. I'm glad.

43:00.622 --> 43:02.222
Well, you can be happy too.

43:02.261 --> 43:05.022
Maybe not straightaway, but...

43:05.062 --> 43:06.622
Well, actually, erm...

43:08.981 --> 43:13.742
Actually, I'm feeling the best
I have done for a very long time.

43:15.182 --> 43:17.781
I met someone over lunch
at The Savoy

43:17.821 --> 43:22.861
and erm, he took me to the races
at Ascot last week.

43:22.901 --> 43:26.702
His name's St John.

43:26.742 --> 43:28.861
St John Gurney-Clifford.

43:28.901 --> 43:31.182
He doesn't like to use his title.

43:33.861 --> 43:36.502
Well, that's great.

43:37.542 --> 43:39.301
I'd love you to meet him.

43:39.341 --> 43:42.502
Maybe... Maybe at his estate
in Norfolk.

43:49.222 --> 43:53.142
Being cast out of Eden
left us hopeless, despairing.

43:53.182 --> 43:55.381
Craving a return
to a place that was lost.

43:55.421 --> 43:58.662
But even though Jesus died
to cleanse us of our sins...

44:00.062 --> 44:02.821
..we still find ways
to sin against each other.

44:09.182 --> 44:11.502
To live in guilt and shame.

44:21.142 --> 44:23.421
But I refuse to believe
it'll be this way.

44:33.582 --> 44:36.142
By God's grace we can be forgiven.

44:41.981 --> 44:44.102
And we too can forgive.

44:55.102 --> 44:57.222
All right? You all good?

44:57.261 --> 44:58.821
And in turn...

45:00.861 --> 45:03.781
..find the hope
for the world we want to live in.
