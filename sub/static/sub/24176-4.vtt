00:32.491 --> 00:35.279
<i>Early this morning
began the day of goodbyes</i>

00:35.494 --> 00:38.111
<i>to the latest victims
of Mafia terrorism.</i>

00:38.330 --> 00:40.697
<i>In an incessant rain...</i>

00:40.916 --> 00:42.827
MAY 25th

00:43.043 --> 00:45.284
<i>thousands of people
stood outside the basilica.</i>

00:46.797 --> 00:48.663
<i>Butcher's meat!</i>

00:56.473 --> 00:59.090
<i>Composed, dignified,
despite their anger,</i>

00:59.268 --> 01:02.636
<i>was the pain of relatives,
colleagues, students,</i>

01:02.854 --> 01:06.063
<i>young people and women,
Mafia orphans and widows</i>

01:06.275 --> 01:09.859
<i>who participated today
in a ritual they know all too well...</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:16.653
Dad?

01:22.165 --> 01:24.247
<i>Leonardo, thank you.</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:27.080
<i>It's all here,
you're punctual and precise.</i>

01:27.671 --> 01:29.833
Viola, go get ready.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.799
<i>We'll get along, you and me.</i>

01:34.011 --> 01:36.969
Sure, maybe we can
have a beer together.

01:38.056 --> 01:42.391
But you can buy, I'll stop by for you
at the Prosecutor's office. Alright?

01:43.687 --> 01:45.052
Rocco?

01:45.439 --> 01:47.146
Not talking anymore?

01:48.567 --> 01:50.774
I know lots about you too.

01:51.361 --> 01:56.026
<i>Rosaria Costa,
widow of agent Vito Schifani,</i>

01:57.117 --> 02:00.781
<i>baptized in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.</i>

02:01.705 --> 02:07.121
<i>In the name of all those who've
given their lives for the State...</i>

02:07.628 --> 02:10.871
<i>I ask that justice be done.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:16.216
<i>Now... addressing
the men of the Mafia...</i>

02:16.386 --> 02:18.423
<i>because there are many in here...</i>

02:18.639 --> 02:22.132
<i>and not,
but certainly not Christians.</i>

02:22.851 --> 02:24.933
<i>Know</i>

02:25.145 --> 02:28.308
<i>there's a chance for forgiveness
even for you.</i>

02:28.607 --> 02:31.850
<i>I forgive you, but you must kneel...</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:34.894
<i>if you have the courage to change.</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:37.522
<i>But they won't change!</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:36.167
Scalfaro's being elected President
of Italy and you just sit here?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.540
They're still
all Christian Democrats!

03:39.386 --> 03:42.674
We've assigned the Commissions,

03:42.889 --> 03:45.051
you got Culture.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.141
Culture?

03:48.770 --> 03:50.636
I know fuck all about culture!

03:50.856 --> 03:52.767
Study, you've become a grind.

03:52.941 --> 03:55.057
Can I change?

03:55.861 --> 03:58.603
No, nominations are closed.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.834
The fratricide clash between Forlani
and Andreotti didn't pay off

04:17.966 --> 04:20.207
and in the end, Scalfaro won.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.966
I don't want the overall data...

04:22.179 --> 04:24.045
Hello.

04:24.222 --> 04:26.429
Mr. Notte, please come in.

04:29.519 --> 04:32.011
Sorry, it's for taking notes,

04:32.230 --> 04:34.016
an old habit.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.143
No matter. What's going on?

04:36.318 --> 04:39.310
- I'd say we've invaded your office.
- Why wasn't I informed?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.440
I didn't know anything.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.231
Hello.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.737
You must be Leonardo.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.454
Rachele Manni, communications
and public relations.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.489
- He's...
- Paolo Pellegrini.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.834
- A Publitalia surveyor.
- Good to see you.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.378
Luciano Savoldi, Socialist,

04:58.590 --> 05:00.706
he's also been ma or of Lecco.
y

05:01.176 --> 05:03.588
Well, I've introduced the whole team.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.884
- Team?
- Didn't Dell'Utri tell you?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.523
What's all this about a dream team?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.819
I'd rather call it a Study Center.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.692
I decided to flank you with experts.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.821
I don't need anyone,
teamwork isn't for me.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.035
I know...

05:31.039 --> 05:33.451
you're a free agent, a samurai.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.831
But, you see...

05:42.175 --> 05:45.213
the samurai preach
the elimination of the Id.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.882
Experts of what?

05:48.098 --> 05:49.554
Lodato and Savoldi are politicians,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.799
who needs a Christian Democrat
and a Socialist?

05:51.935 --> 05:54.597
Andreotti is finished,

05:54.813 --> 05:57.430
Craxi is under attack,
Falcone was blown up.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.732
Remember I said
if the country collapses,

06:00.902 --> 06:02.734
the company will too.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.988
We have to understand
where the country's going.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.157
You won't want to do it all yourself.

06:11.329 --> 06:12.740
Read it.

06:13.623 --> 06:14.829
Thank you.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.675
See?

06:27.888 --> 06:30.346
Di Pietro gets a security detail too.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.717
Can you stand in for me?
I'm in a mess today.

06:34.936 --> 06:38.520
- What's your life like?
- You have to take Mainaghi home.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.183
The Beast interrogated him
with all the trimmings,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.484
to bust his balls a little.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.234
I'd like house arrest at his place.

06:48.450 --> 06:50.032
I'll take care of it.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.404
Thanks.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.159
I'll get the keys.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.175
Am I bothering you?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.386
I can tell by your look.

07:19.606 --> 07:22.894
I saw many looks like yours in jail.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.059
Anger, envy...

07:25.153 --> 07:28.942
I don't envy you at all. Who would
you be without your wife's money?

07:29.157 --> 07:33.025
A puny industrialist with a company
on the verge of bankruptcy.

07:34.037 --> 07:36.153
So much ambition, no scruples.

07:36.414 --> 07:40.078
You marry the right woman,
lick Socialist asses and you're set.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.664
You buy a private jet, villas,

07:42.879 --> 07:45.086
all those companies
with your name on them.

07:45.757 --> 07:48.419
But I think you know
you're not worth a fucking thing.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.210
You're wounding
my self-esteem, you know?

07:52.681 --> 07:55.423
I wonder if you ever think
of the people you killed.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.349
Even?

07:58.853 --> 08:00.844
The Zenit supposedly
sold infected blood.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.896
Lots of people got sick, died...

08:05.652 --> 08:08.360
of hepatitis, AIDS.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.605
I was wrong.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.407
Yours isn't envy, it's an obsession,

08:14.619 --> 08:17.828
the medical term for obsession
comes from "destiny".

08:18.039 --> 08:21.703
- I guess I was your destiny.
- And maybe I'm yours.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.581
Anyway, we'll meet in prison.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.046
Who can say?

08:28.299 --> 08:31.291
Meantime I'll go to this prison.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.885
Thanks for the lift.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.049
Hello.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.721
Please.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.266
So, we're colleagues.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.852
Have you been assigned a Commission?

10:10.068 --> 10:11.650
Culture.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.569
What's so funny?

10:14.823 --> 10:17.906
Forgive me, but Culture
isn't a great Commission.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.617
There's no money,

10:20.787 --> 10:24.405
your party colleagues don't hold you
in very high esteem.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.574
Unless you chose it.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.542
No?

10:30.755 --> 10:31.995
Okay!

10:38.847 --> 10:41.339
I talked to the guys from Veneto,

10:41.599 --> 10:44.717
Commissions can be assigned
until July 10th,

10:44.936 --> 10:47.678
that's the deadline
to communicate them officially.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.145
And so?

10:49.232 --> 10:51.974
Culture isn't worth fucking damn,
give it to someone else.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.895
Well, you're not
worth fucking damn either.

10:57.699 --> 10:59.315
Who's not worth fucking damn?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.527
Let go of him.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.195
Okay.

11:07.709 --> 11:09.746
What did I do to you?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.628
Are you forgetting I saved your ass?

11:13.840 --> 11:17.253
If not for me, those two
would still be screwing your wife.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.922
You should thank that day,

11:20.180 --> 11:23.218
when this fool here
spoke to Bossi about you

11:23.600 --> 11:27.719
and now you have a salary,
you'll soon get a nice life annuity,

11:28.229 --> 11:30.812
all thanks to yours truly!

11:31.399 --> 11:34.016
You should kiss the ground I walk on

11:34.903 --> 11:37.235
and instead you bust nuts!

11:38.948 --> 11:41.235
What you do is incredible!

11:41.993 --> 11:45.156
You say you don't
understand much about culture?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.072
What do you understand
anything about?

11:50.627 --> 11:52.368
The South 40%.

11:52.587 --> 11:55.045
Center-north 30%.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.506
The polls show the PDS growing.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.298
If the Left gets in power,
the country's screwed.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.263
Mr. Notte,
there's someone to see you.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.930
- Not now.
- He said it's extremely urgent.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.272
The PDS wins, especially
in the Center-south,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.816
but it's growing even in the North.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.497
How do you fucking dare come here?

12:35.004 --> 12:39.293
I wanted to see where you work,
we have the same teacher.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.795
Fabrizio made us what we became,

12:44.889 --> 12:47.756
for the good,
and especially for the bad.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.554
You don't know a thing about me.

12:51.145 --> 12:53.512
I remember you, Buio.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.899
You were one of the heads
of the student movement.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.773
I was there when they arrested you,

13:01.531 --> 13:04.193
false accusations, an ugly story...

13:04.784 --> 13:07.867
If Fabrizio hadn't been there
to offer you a way out...

13:08.288 --> 13:09.904
Great way out!

13:10.164 --> 13:11.780
You could have refused,

13:12.041 --> 13:13.907
but you didn't,

13:15.920 --> 13:20.164
because there's something
profoundly immoral in you.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.715
We really should have
that beer together,

13:25.930 --> 13:28.217
maybe after you give me
the second installment.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.678
I just gave you
100 million, Venturi.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.385
What else do you want?
I don't print the money.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.637
I want one hundred more.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.684
Careful you don't disappoint me.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.329
Paolo, do an approval survey
on center-line politicians.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.878
There must still be
someone in popular favor.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.306
<i>We really should have
that beer together,</i>

14:11.726 --> 14:14.138
<i>maybe after you give me
the second installment.</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:19.407
- Where are you going?
- Outside.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.786
You can't, you're in house arrest.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.539
I'm free.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.265
I've always been free.

15:38.729 --> 15:40.219
Turn the light out?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.866
I understood you couldn't go out.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.739
But instead!

15:57.248 --> 15:58.989
It's the end of an era.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.208
They're all scared to show Di Pietro
they have money to spend.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.334
More champagne?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.254
I've never been good at saying no.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.803
You want to see "Basic lnstinct".

16:18.728 --> 16:20.890
Want us to go?

16:21.272 --> 16:23.639
Then we sleep together.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.775
It's really the end of an era.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.147
- What is it?
- Nothing.

16:47.256 --> 16:50.715
Silvio, it's Michele Mainaghi.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.169
I wanted to ask a favor.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.215
There's a friend of mine,
Veronica Castello,

16:58.392 --> 17:02.056
she works in television,
and doesn't like what they're offering.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.311
She's beautiful and very good,

17:08.569 --> 17:10.776
maybe you can do something.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.865
Will you call me back? Bye!

17:20.414 --> 17:23.031
We're not going to the show tonight.

17:48.276 --> 17:52.190
<i>The Church's social doctrine,
from the "Rerum novarum" to today.</i>

17:52.446 --> 17:54.938
<i>There's also
an important statement,</i>

17:55.157 --> 17:57.319
<i>because for the first time officially,</i>

17:57.577 --> 17:59.284
<i>the free market is recognized,</i>

17:59.453 --> 18:03.788
<i>it allows an optimal
location of resources.</i>

18:04.834 --> 18:08.043
<i>Alterations and distortions
are certainly possible,</i>

18:08.254 --> 18:10.211
<i>but it's also certain</i>

18:10.339 --> 18:14.799
<i>that Communism,
wherever it's been applied,</i>

18:15.386 --> 18:18.378
<i>has brought negative effects.</i>

18:18.639 --> 18:22.303
<i>Above all, the loss of man's
most precious good, freedom,</i>

18:23.227 --> 18:26.265
<i>accompanied
by deplorable living conditions...</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:28.396
How did this idea pop up?

18:28.649 --> 18:30.856
I made a survey
in my daughter's class

18:31.027 --> 18:33.815
on the most-loved public figure,
I broadened the sample

18:34.030 --> 18:37.273
and the result is the same:
Berlusconi is the most loved.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.441
In second place is Cossiga.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.654
Because he's crazy, funny,
sparks the imagination.

18:44.165 --> 18:46.327
Third place is Schwarzenegger.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.751
So, your theory says
Terminator could go into politics.

18:49.962 --> 18:54.251
Your survey was with kids from 9
to 13, people who don't even vote?

18:54.592 --> 18:57.675
No, not yet, not at the moment.

18:58.220 --> 19:01.053
You wanted a revolutionary idea,
people love him!

19:01.349 --> 19:04.512
Television's power is immense,
despite what's written here.

19:04.602 --> 19:07.685
We have to understand what
the major political force will be,

19:07.813 --> 19:09.724
we're not making one ourselves.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.523
We have a leader,
he's right before our eyes,

19:12.735 --> 19:14.396
Berlusconi is the man of miracles.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.653
It's an appealing idea,
but impracticable.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.612
Come back down to Earth.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.991
Among the political moderates,
the popularity list shows:

19:26.207 --> 19:30.246
in third place, Martinazzoli,
in second La Malfa and first...

19:30.419 --> 19:33.252
- Mario Segni.
- You killed the suspense!

19:33.381 --> 19:35.338
- It's him!
- He won the referendum.

19:35.883 --> 19:39.877
He has 500,000 signatures
for the next, and he's clean-cut,

19:40.096 --> 19:44.260
a Christian Democrat untouched by
the investigations, a true moderate.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.642
- Moderate!
- Does the word bother you?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.637
Political renewal
passes also through words.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.893
"Party" makes people run off.

19:53.275 --> 19:56.813
Yes, the parties are in crisis,
but the DC will never die.

19:57.279 --> 20:00.943
The great white whale just
has to find a way to the sea.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.450
- Marcello?
- Yes, meet with him.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.866
Maybe not you, Notte.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.374
Take an evening off,

20:12.002 --> 20:14.334
have a sauna, a Turkish bath,

20:14.505 --> 20:16.416
because you seem a little...

20:36.152 --> 20:38.359
- Hello.
- Thank you.

20:55.421 --> 20:58.083
Want to see
what I bought with your money?

20:58.299 --> 21:00.165
Where are you?

21:36.420 --> 21:37.751
Giuliani!

21:38.631 --> 21:40.417
Help me!

21:41.675 --> 21:45.009
A horrible thing has happened,
I don't know what to do.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.844
Help me!

21:55.731 --> 21:58.268
<i>We really should
have that beer together...</i>

21:58.442 --> 22:00.058
DO I SEND IT TO DI PIETRO?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.234
<i>Maybe after you give me
the second installment.</i>

22:02.321 --> 22:04.437
<i>I just gave you
100 million, Venturi.</i>

22:04.573 --> 22:08.157
<i>- I don't print the money.
- I want another 100.</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:12.070
Have you seen Pastore?

22:13.165 --> 22:14.246
No.

22:15.501 --> 22:17.993
- I'm here, if you like.
- Know where he is?

22:18.420 --> 22:19.626
There he is.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.757
- What's going on?
- You have to help me.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.093
He can't have killed himself!

22:55.332 --> 22:58.040
Can she come by tomorrow
for the deposition?

22:58.252 --> 23:00.869
I'll take her to my place
before they all get here.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.163
It's a delicate situation.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.669
Thanks, I owe you one.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.932
Hello.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.852
I'm listening to Verdi,
a musician from the Lombardy plain.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.722
I'm not here to complain.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.311
Why don't you come in.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.316
You'd like me,
an old Christian Democrat tool,

24:51.532 --> 24:54.820
to help you understand
parliamentary activity.

24:55.452 --> 24:58.990
- If you help me...
- Why should I?

24:59.206 --> 25:02.619
Those like you think
I'm just a party system parasite,

25:02.835 --> 25:04.872
what's more, I'm Neapolitan!

25:05.087 --> 25:07.499
Maybe we'd better just drop it.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.046
Wait!

25:09.299 --> 25:11.415
You heat up fast!

25:11.677 --> 25:14.169
You League people
are all so hotheaded,

25:14.304 --> 25:16.090
not everyone, of course.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.054
Bossi is a sly guy
disguised as a hothead.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.137
Is it desguised or disguised?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.644
I can never remember.

25:28.152 --> 25:32.362
Did you know, in Israel,
they discovered a generosity gene?

25:33.032 --> 25:36.070
Most of the population
is genetically stingy,

25:36.285 --> 25:38.868
but a minority has this gene.

25:39.246 --> 25:42.364
It's a sort of anomaly, a mutation,

25:42.583 --> 25:45.792
like having eleven toes.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.787
You're lucky,

25:49.006 --> 25:52.499
I belong to that genetic minority.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.379
You have eleven toes?

25:54.636 --> 25:58.129
There comes a moment in life
when you desire

25:58.307 --> 26:01.299
to pass on your experience
to someone.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.302
You happened by at the right moment.

26:07.691 --> 26:11.150
Dear Bosco, Parliament
is like a chess board:

26:12.237 --> 26:15.355
you have to decide
to move as a pawn or a king,

26:15.616 --> 26:17.823
before the others do.

26:18.035 --> 26:21.699
You have to be indispensable
to your parliamentary group,

26:22.331 --> 26:24.789
if not, you won't count a thing.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.241
- Like a pawn?
- Right.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.328
You have to use your characteristics

26:30.547 --> 26:32.163
as qualities,

26:32.341 --> 26:35.299
your weaknesses
have to become strengths,

26:35.594 --> 26:39.132
find a place
where your competence is valued.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.976
What is it?

26:47.147 --> 26:50.685
You keep looking around, did you
skip out on the bill last time?

26:50.859 --> 26:53.317
My party doesn't want us
to come here.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.736
To the "Two Bandits"? Why not?

26:56.740 --> 26:59.323
It's in the off-limits list.

26:59.701 --> 27:03.444
That's being naive,
because politics in Rome

27:03.664 --> 27:05.280
isn't done in Parliament.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.824
The important decisions
are made in places like these.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.754
Tell me about your experiences,
you've certainly done things in life.

27:13.882 --> 27:18.171
Besides rugby and the Navy...

27:18.887 --> 27:20.719
The Navy, perfect!

27:21.014 --> 27:23.221
We'll grab the subject.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.390
Defense Commission!

27:26.812 --> 27:28.928
I'm usually against the criteria

27:29.148 --> 27:32.061
of competence
for the assignment of roles,

27:32.276 --> 27:36.691
but parliamentary democracy
isn't based on competence,

27:37.531 --> 27:39.568
it's based on representation.

27:40.409 --> 27:43.242
But you're a desperate case,
believe me,

27:43.537 --> 27:45.278
culture is not your thing.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.370
It's decided: Defense Commission.

27:50.544 --> 27:52.911
Strategic, a nice budget

27:53.297 --> 27:57.586
and you know the Army, you can
speak up without feeling like a peon.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.710
- A peon...
- Low man on the totem pole.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.387
What is it?

28:07.895 --> 28:09.431
A guy from the League.

28:09.646 --> 28:12.183
Bortolotti,
he decides the Commissions.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.728
I'm screwed if he sees me here.

28:15.903 --> 28:19.271
For now, go out the back way,

28:19.489 --> 28:22.857
then I'll come
and explain something to you.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.193
But I'll finish my shrimp first.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.546
Now it's all clear, I hope,
Mr. Di Pietro.

28:46.516 --> 28:49.133
JUNE 1st

28:51.188 --> 28:53.304
We hooked Mongini.

28:53.607 --> 28:56.144
He started confessing
over the intercom.

28:57.694 --> 29:00.652
Okay, Mr. Amorese,
that's all, thank you.

29:04.451 --> 29:06.442
Wrap up the statement
and have him sign it.

29:07.162 --> 29:08.527
Yes, sir.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.667
- Then can I go home?
- Yes, you're just a witness.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.839
For now! I heard them a moment ago.

29:21.385 --> 29:23.547
He said: "We hooked Mongini."

29:24.429 --> 29:27.387
He said "hooked",
not even if he were a stray dog.

29:29.017 --> 29:32.760
Fiat iustitia et pereat mundus.

29:33.021 --> 29:34.682
What?

29:34.898 --> 29:37.640
"Let justice reign,
though the world should perish".

29:37.859 --> 29:40.772
A phrase by Kant,
strange you don't know it,

29:40.946 --> 29:43.779
it's written on
the side of this building.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.445
Today they'll bury Mainaghi,

29:47.703 --> 29:50.491
do you think
you've done the right thing?

29:50.664 --> 29:54.202
Do you think
bribes will stop circulating?

29:54.418 --> 29:57.285
Di Pietro was poor,
he had a hard life,

29:57.462 --> 30:00.420
that's why he has it in
for those with money.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.920
This is revenge, not justice.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.887
You don't feel well?

30:25.490 --> 30:27.356
"Innocent and guilty,

30:28.076 --> 30:30.067
good and bad,

30:30.996 --> 30:34.159
just and sinner,
all come to the same end,

30:35.250 --> 30:38.333
we all have the same destiny."

30:45.552 --> 30:48.419
"Love, hate and human passions

30:48.638 --> 30:50.675
end with death.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.307
So, enjoy life.

30:54.269 --> 30:58.684
Eat your bread serenely
and drink your wine with joy.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.517
Enjoy life with the woman you love,

31:03.820 --> 31:07.529
for the brief, empty years
God allows you to live."

31:13.663 --> 31:17.156
"Be happy while you're still young.

31:18.877 --> 31:23.166
Do all you like
and follow your heart's desires.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.166
Life will end.

31:36.144 --> 31:39.136
Everything is like a gust of wind.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.765
Vanity, vanity...

31:44.319 --> 31:45.730
all is vanity."

31:51.618 --> 31:55.407
- You all killed him.
- He killed me.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.412
What do you mean?

32:15.016 --> 32:18.304
Why would my father
have done such a thing?

32:19.229 --> 32:21.061
For money.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.889
Second-rate blood costs less.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.901
Now he's dead, okay, are you happy?

32:29.656 --> 32:30.862
No.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.940
Get out.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.942
I wanted you to know
why I did what I did.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.239
Get out!

33:14.493 --> 33:17.235
- How could you do it?
- Do what?

33:18.997 --> 33:22.331
"The evening before he died,
Mainaghi dined at a restaurant,

33:22.501 --> 33:24.538
he was tranquil,
making plans for the future.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.586
The person with him can't understand
such a clamorous gesture.

33:27.672 --> 33:30.664
Since his release from jail,
he was ready to start a new life."

33:30.759 --> 33:31.920
Want me to go on?

33:32.010 --> 33:33.876
His wife gave me an interview

33:34.095 --> 33:37.008
and I was asked for a portrait
of Mainaghi, what's the harm?

33:38.016 --> 33:40.678
You wrote things I told you!

33:40.769 --> 33:43.682
That's why you helped me,
just to get first-hand details?

33:43.772 --> 33:46.355
- Cut it out...
- I needed you!

33:47.609 --> 33:50.727
You're my big sister
and you wrote an article.

33:50.904 --> 33:54.192
- Did I give your name?
- So not to reveal we're sisters.

33:54.407 --> 33:56.023
I kept your name out,

33:56.243 --> 33:59.907
I kept them from attacking you
like starving dogs.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.577
I honored Mainaghi in that article,

34:04.793 --> 34:07.535
or no one
would have known those things.

34:07.754 --> 34:11.748
You're so good,
you always do everything right.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.710
Are you angry because, by protecting
you, I kept you from being famous?

34:16.929 --> 34:18.670
Fuck off!

34:20.266 --> 34:23.259
- Where are you going?
- I don't know, get off my ass.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.181
Let me by!

34:33.487 --> 34:35.855
I've said this for years,
Italy is oppressed

34:36.074 --> 34:40.443
by a form of soviet statism that's
expensive, inefficient, oppressive.

34:40.620 --> 34:43.658
There's need of great liberalization.

34:43.873 --> 34:45.284
We think so too.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.793
To us, then!

34:55.844 --> 34:57.175
Good evening.

34:58.847 --> 35:00.713
Sorry I'm late.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.768
- We've already eaten.
- I'm not hungry.

35:06.146 --> 35:09.059
- Leonardo Notte.
- Mario Segni.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.857
Leonardo works with us.

35:12.027 --> 35:15.816
With all due respect, I still
don't understand who "us" is.

35:16.031 --> 35:18.898
We're a group of moderates
worried about the country.

35:19.159 --> 35:22.402
I know Savoldi's and Lodato's
political background,

35:22.621 --> 35:24.407
but yours?

35:24.581 --> 35:27.994
- I'm in advertising.
- How does that mix with politics?

35:28.209 --> 35:32.294
They're both based
on broken promises.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.376
A nice dessert.

35:39.429 --> 35:41.670
Friend, are there any desserts?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.964
- I'll bring the menu.
- Just a moment.

35:44.059 --> 35:47.017
- I'd like a mousse, thank you.
- Right away.

35:47.687 --> 35:50.429
Actually no, some pie, thank you.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.516
Wait, bear with me,

35:53.735 --> 35:56.523
I've changed my mind,
bring me the menu.

35:58.698 --> 36:03.443
Excuse me, but what exactly
do you want from me?

36:03.620 --> 36:06.533
To know if you'll be leading
the moderates.

36:06.706 --> 36:10.324
I don't know, the referendum battle
keeps me very busy.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.286
Good, people love you.

36:13.463 --> 36:17.502
But your accumulated political
capital will have to be spent.

36:18.635 --> 36:22.378
For that matter, I've long dreamed
of a house of moderates.

36:22.597 --> 36:27.342
- We could build it together.
- Yes, but we should understand more.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.016
Let's understand it!

36:29.229 --> 36:30.685
Here's the menu, gentlemen.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.568
Excuse me, may I?
Dessert is on the house.

36:47.330 --> 36:50.163
Girls? Bring three chairs?

36:53.503 --> 36:55.710
I've spent a little capital.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.834
They are...

36:59.175 --> 37:00.540
Olga.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.255
Irina and Katarina.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.547
- What are you trying to do?
- He said yes.

37:06.766 --> 37:09.554
In our world this is
how we seal agreements.

37:09.644 --> 37:11.851
I'm mortified,
Leonardo wasn't even invited,

37:12.021 --> 37:14.308
I don't know what he was thinking.

37:14.524 --> 37:16.856
This is the house of moderates?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.809
No!

37:19.070 --> 37:22.563
It's a big house, there must be room
for three Communist exiles!

37:25.076 --> 37:27.568
Do you know why
I came into politics late?

37:28.496 --> 37:29.782
No.

37:29.998 --> 37:34.208
My father said: “First earn
an independent position.

37:34.544 --> 37:38.287
You always have
to be able to slam the door."

37:40.508 --> 37:42.374
Goodbye.

37:47.849 --> 37:52.389
They've already been paid,
now that we're here...

38:16.044 --> 38:19.378
- Do you know this Russian hymn?
- I was a sympathizer once.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.672
- And now'?
- I'm a whore like you.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.552
Know what they say about Communism,
don't you?

38:27.764 --> 38:30.722
It was a good idea,
but it didn't work, you know why?

38:30.934 --> 38:34.518
Because there are men
and you know men better than me.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.679
Put bubbles!

38:37.065 --> 38:39.397
Da, I put bubbles!

38:42.237 --> 38:46.822
Each of us thinks about his own shit,
we want to eat, fuck and make money.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.274
- You should be a politician.
- I tried.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.782
But a young man from the PCI
sold me out to the cops.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.910
- Why?
- I was in the movements.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.909
The Communists hated us,
we were the Left competition.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.504
They framed me
saying I was in the armed struggle,

39:02.715 --> 39:04.706
see how men are?

39:08.096 --> 39:10.713
You're the first people I've told.

39:10.932 --> 39:13.765
- Didn't you go to jail?
- No.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.842
How come?

39:16.020 --> 39:19.138
My life can be summarized
in three words...

39:20.483 --> 39:22.065
illusion...

39:25.780 --> 39:27.236
delusion...

39:33.162 --> 39:35.199
and collusion.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.193
I'm Veronica Castello.

40:11.993 --> 40:13.825
I know who you are.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.944
Please, come in.

40:25.214 --> 40:28.002
Sorry for having
the deputy prosecutor call you,

40:28.217 --> 40:30.208
but I didn't know how to contact you.

40:31.846 --> 40:33.428
Condolences.

40:34.390 --> 40:36.631
How long did you live here,

40:36.851 --> 40:38.717
one year, two?

40:39.604 --> 40:42.562
This isn't my house,
I always knew that.

40:57.956 --> 41:02.041
Where do I send all these things?

41:04.295 --> 41:05.785
I don't know.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.372
Don't you have a place to stay?

41:12.470 --> 41:17.055
You gave yourself to an old man
for two years and what did you get?

41:20.019 --> 41:21.635
Nothing.

41:44.877 --> 41:46.663
TWO BANDITS

41:47.171 --> 41:50.880
- Goodbye, sir.
- Bye Salvatore, see you Tuesday.

41:53.219 --> 41:54.960
Well, what do you know!

41:55.179 --> 41:56.795
Bortolotti!

41:57.640 --> 41:59.256
What do you want?

41:59.475 --> 42:02.217
Isn't this one
of the off-limits places?

42:03.563 --> 42:07.727
- I don't know.
- You gave me the list yourself!

42:09.569 --> 42:13.654
"To the 'Two Bandits', no! Can't go
to a place with a name like that!"

42:14.907 --> 42:17.990
I didn't realize,
anyway I'm not coming again.

42:18.494 --> 42:20.735
"See you Tuesday, Salvatore!"

42:22.790 --> 42:26.078
I might by undisciplined,
but you're not without sin.

42:28.713 --> 42:32.752
- What do you want?
- The Defense Commission.

42:36.262 --> 42:40.347
- There may be no time.
- Find the time.

42:41.517 --> 42:44.430
Look at it like this: I'm a soldier,

42:44.645 --> 42:47.854
I'll do less damage
in Defense than in Culture.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.062
Don't make that face.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.814
Bye.

43:10.338 --> 43:12.921
- Why did you want to see me?
- Sit down.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.924
What's this?

43:26.813 --> 43:29.180
It's Michele's will.

43:30.066 --> 43:32.524
The notary will give
the reading of it tomorrow,

43:32.735 --> 43:36.148
but I wanted to prepare you,
also for your brother's reaction.

43:38.533 --> 43:41.195
Recently your dad
kept Zeno close to him,

43:41.410 --> 43:45.153
more to keep him from doing damage
than for esteem.

43:45.873 --> 43:49.537
That's why he left the absolute
majority of his stocks to you.

43:50.378 --> 43:52.085
What's that mean?

43:52.880 --> 43:54.962
That you're in charge now.

44:05.768 --> 44:09.261
- They didn't want to let me through.
- You have no appointment, Miss.

44:09.355 --> 44:12.893
JUNE 16th

44:13.901 --> 44:16.814
A dear friend of mine called
the Cavaliere personally

44:16.988 --> 44:19.070
and made an appointment for me.

44:21.993 --> 44:24.075
Veronica Castello.

44:25.204 --> 44:27.536
I'm sorry, your name's not here.

44:28.249 --> 44:32.163
He did it before my eyes, he left
a message on the answering machine.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.002
There must be an error, check again.

44:35.214 --> 44:37.455
A message on his answering machine?

44:40.469 --> 44:42.176
Look, they're friends.

44:42.388 --> 44:46.097
Tell your friend to call,
that will resolve everything.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.884
What's your friend's name?

44:52.273 --> 44:53.934
Michele Mainaghi.

44:55.526 --> 44:57.142
I'm sorry.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.953
A complicated evening.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.909
I know what you're aiming at,
get to the point.

45:15.379 --> 45:18.337
Taking three whores
to the dinner with Segni

45:18.507 --> 45:21.169
was a brilliant idea, you think?

45:21.344 --> 45:23.210
It's clone with hesitant clients.

45:23.429 --> 45:27.047
If they accept, it sets
a pact of trust that lasts forever.

45:28.267 --> 45:33.182
Segni takes an hour just choosing
dessert! He'll go nowhere.

45:33.856 --> 45:36.848
You deliberately
sabotaged the meeting.

45:37.026 --> 45:39.017
I'm not here for you to preach me.

45:40.613 --> 45:42.479
Then why are you here?

45:42.698 --> 45:44.689
To tell you I'm out.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.237
I've had it.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.580
You don't understand that
the electorate isn't moderate,

45:59.799 --> 46:02.336
it's excessive, horny,
it goes where their dicks lead!

46:03.886 --> 46:06.503
I don't like firing people,

46:07.014 --> 46:09.597
I'm glad you did it yourself.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.674
Goodbye.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.985
Bravo!

46:34.500 --> 46:36.286
Back to work!

46:36.544 --> 46:38.911
Scaglia, I'm surprised at you.

46:43.718 --> 46:46.961
Pastore, what's that shit face?

46:47.555 --> 46:49.512
Are you sick?

46:50.891 --> 46:52.802
Why don't you stay home?

46:53.019 --> 46:56.603
You've been coming here
like a ghost for two weeks.

46:57.231 --> 47:00.349
- Lost interest in this work?
- You only want Craxi and Larini.

47:00.443 --> 47:03.231
- That again?
- Larini's in the Tropics now.

47:04.238 --> 47:07.572
- Antonio, can you come?
- We're not done.

47:10.286 --> 47:13.153
- What is it?
- Amorese committed suicide.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.035
Goddammit!

47:17.710 --> 47:20.247
Sir, what's happened?

47:20.796 --> 47:23.163
Amorese shot himself.

47:30.056 --> 47:32.764
<i>Dear Mr. Di Pietro, forgive me,</i>

47:33.142 --> 47:35.600
<i>but I'm extremely overcome,</i>

47:35.811 --> 47:38.178
<i>aware of the error I committed</i>

47:38.397 --> 47:42.356
<i>and the dishonor of it to my family.</i>

47:43.819 --> 47:46.937
<i>I acknowledge and thank you
for the sensitivity,</i>

47:47.156 --> 47:50.239
<i>even in the just rigor of your job,</i>

47:50.451 --> 47:52.317
<i>which you showed me.</i>

47:52.536 --> 47:56.154
I declare the XI Legislature
Defense Commission installed.

47:56.499 --> 47:58.706
<i>I have revealed to my wife,
who was unaware,</i>

47:58.918 --> 48:00.909
<i>the matters I've confessed,</i>

48:01.837 --> 48:05.876
<i>I also told her of my commitment
to return all that's owed</i>

48:06.092 --> 48:08.208
<i>and necessary.</i>

48:08.386 --> 48:11.924
<i>Be assured she will make
every effort to honor the promise.</i>

48:12.723 --> 48:16.057
<i>I asked my lawyer to assist her
in what's necessary.</i>

48:16.268 --> 48:18.760
<i>For this reason, I implore you,</i>

48:19.855 --> 48:23.473
<i>consider it my last wish,
for her and my children,</i>

48:24.527 --> 48:26.859
<i>not to enact
foreclosures or seizures</i>

48:27.071 --> 48:30.280
<i>so they can fulfill the maximum</i>

48:30.491 --> 48:33.859
<i>and hope something remains
for them to go forward</i>

48:34.161 --> 48:36.573
<i>and allow my children to study.</i>

48:37.248 --> 48:40.707
<i>Given what happened,
I can no longer do so.</i>

48:40.918 --> 48:43.330
<i>I am sorry,
and it is right I should pay.</i>

48:43.921 --> 48:48.210
<i>Do not consider me worse
than I already feel.</i>

48:50.386 --> 48:53.799
<i>Farewell, Renato Amorese.</i>

49:16.954 --> 49:19.036
NEXT TIME

49:19.123 --> 49:20.329
I found out your secret.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.460
You need to put ice on it.

49:32.553 --> 49:34.965
<i>We'll never know.</i>
