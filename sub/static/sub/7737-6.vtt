00:06.107 --> 00:06.374
.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.007
- Previously on "Colony"...

00:08.509 --> 00:10.144
- Get on your knees!
Do it now!

00:10.178 --> 00:12.813
- As it turns out, Geronimo was
more of a figurehead

00:12.846 --> 00:13.981
than an actual terrorist.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.549
- That's unfortunate, Alan.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.519
- Trust me, I'm gonna turn this
into a win for us.

00:18.552 --> 00:21.489
I need a patsy--someone to take
the fall in public.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.692
You play Geronimo,
I'll spare your life

00:24.725 --> 00:26.660
and get you relocated
to another colony.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.997
- We made a deal!
We made a deal!

00:30.030 --> 00:31.532
- Phyllis is dead.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.702
Someone shot her and her husband
up in the Green Zone.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.904
Did you say anything
about Phyllis to anybody?

00:36.937 --> 00:38.706
- No, of course not.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.074
- Will, ride with me.

00:40.108 --> 00:41.109
There's someone
I want you to meet.

00:41.142 --> 00:43.611
Come on, get in the car.

00:43.644 --> 00:47.281
- All set?
We're on the clock.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.050
- Redbird One, good to go.
- Roger that.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.885
Rolling out.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.625
[sirens wailing]

01:08.902 --> 01:12.606
- Today Los Angeles
knows peace once again.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.608
The tribunal has ruled.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.611
The sentence
has been handed down.

01:17.645 --> 01:19.213
And now, finally,

01:19.247 --> 01:21.182
after Geronimo's long reign
of terror,

01:21.215 --> 01:24.218
justice is to be carried out.

01:37.898 --> 01:41.001
[phone ringing]

01:51.445 --> 01:53.847
- Yes?

01:53.881 --> 01:57.185
[sighs]
Of course I've been watching.

01:58.886 --> 02:00.554
His decision.

02:00.588 --> 02:03.291
But as it is his bloc,
we thought it was important

02:03.324 --> 02:06.427
to give him some latitude.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.497
At least the counterinsurgency
he put together

02:09.530 --> 02:11.332
has been effective,

02:11.365 --> 02:15.469
especially considering the loss
of the task force head.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.738
Yes, I know.
I spoke with New York.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.273
They're put out,

02:19.307 --> 02:22.310
but they're looking
for another solution.

02:22.343 --> 02:26.447
Well, they selected him
for a reason, so...

02:26.480 --> 02:28.682
I think we just let it
play out.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.484
He either gets things
under control,

02:30.518 --> 02:33.787
or he gives us the justification
that we need to make a change.

02:35.223 --> 02:37.558
No, I know.
We need to be ready.

02:40.228 --> 02:42.830
No, I won't let it come
to that.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.572
[seagulls crying]

03:02.450 --> 03:05.419
[dramatic music]

03:05.453 --> 03:10.123
*

03:12.125 --> 03:15.896
[sirens wailing]

03:26.307 --> 03:28.276
- What's the problem?

03:28.309 --> 03:30.578
- What was the gain
in doing that?

03:30.611 --> 03:32.313
- The people demanded justice

03:32.346 --> 03:34.315
for what Geronimo did,
and we granted it.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.083
- That guy
wasn't even Geronimo.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.586
- It's called catharsis.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.088
The public gets appeased,
and we remind them

03:41.121 --> 03:43.924
that law and order
will endure in this bloc.

03:43.957 --> 03:47.495
- 'Cause you strung up
a radio announcer.

03:47.528 --> 03:50.498
- Outside of our inner circle,
no one know the particulars

03:50.531 --> 03:52.600
of his involvement
with the Resistance.

03:52.633 --> 03:53.934
- Except his family.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.304
- The fact is
that Luis supported

03:56.337 --> 03:57.971
a violent terrorist movement,

03:58.005 --> 03:59.907
which is no better
than being a terrorist himself.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.742
Trust me when I tell you
that what I did

04:01.775 --> 04:04.144
gave him the most merciful end
he was gonna get.

04:04.177 --> 04:07.080
- What you did is just gonna
piss people off.

04:07.114 --> 04:08.716
- Let them be angry.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.386
They're alive, and they're
still relatively free.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.687
You think I martyred him,

04:13.721 --> 04:17.190
but I believe
self-interest rules the day.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.759
And when people see
the consequences

04:18.792 --> 04:20.561
of participating
in the Resistance,

04:20.594 --> 04:23.196
they're gonna think twice before
getting involved themselves.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.632
- I hope you're right.

04:27.034 --> 04:30.704
- In the meantime, what I have
done has bought you the time

04:30.738 --> 04:32.673
to find the real terrorists--

04:32.706 --> 04:35.809
something
I would greatly appreciate.

04:44.885 --> 04:48.188
[sirens continue wailing]

04:48.221 --> 04:51.224
[man speaking indistinctly
over radio]

04:52.726 --> 04:54.795
[Deftones' "Root"]
- Oh, yeah.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.430
- Oh.

04:56.464 --> 05:04.538
*

05:13.381 --> 05:15.449
* To heed the cause, I will be
barred, but you won't *

05:15.483 --> 05:19.887
* We are here to love heart,
he's up inside *

05:19.920 --> 05:23.491
* We start to cry

05:23.524 --> 05:25.693
* Just because I will afford

05:25.726 --> 05:29.897
* Living in me is so poor

05:29.930 --> 05:34.735
* Deliver me there

05:34.768 --> 05:36.136
- Take the auxiliary route.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.304
- You got it.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.472
- Got it.

05:38.506 --> 05:45.145
*

05:45.178 --> 05:49.917
* To be judged by one
or licked by three *

05:49.950 --> 05:52.820
* And your holes--

05:52.853 --> 05:54.555
- Mike!
- Whoa!

06:02.430 --> 06:04.432
- Oh, my God,
it's an ambush!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.333
- Get us out of here.
- Go!

06:06.434 --> 06:07.635
- Start driving,
or we're all dead!

06:07.668 --> 06:09.336
- No, he's out!

06:09.437 --> 06:12.440
[engine revving]

06:17.010 --> 06:19.580
- We need to get out of here.
- Stay in the car.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.114
[indistinct shouting]

06:21.148 --> 06:23.651
- Move 'em out!
- Move, move!

06:23.684 --> 06:26.019
- Eyes up!
[indistinct shouting]

06:26.053 --> 06:28.589
- Wait. That guy's Homeland.
- They're not with us.

06:28.622 --> 06:32.460
[paintball guns firing]

06:32.460 --> 06:34.161
- What the hell
are they doing?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.464
- Blinding us.

06:36.464 --> 06:38.866
- 60 seconds!
- Move!

06:41.502 --> 06:43.471
[tool grinding]
- What's that?

06:43.504 --> 06:44.838
- Get in the front.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.173
- What? Why?
- Get in the front!

06:46.206 --> 06:48.509
Switch with Snyder!
Get in the back!

06:48.542 --> 06:50.744
[indistinct shouting]
- Go, go!

06:58.919 --> 07:01.555
- Hook in!
Back up! Back up!

07:06.393 --> 07:08.529
- Maintain fire control,
damn it!

07:08.562 --> 07:10.898
[indistinct shouting]

07:18.305 --> 07:20.107
- Keep your head down!

07:21.509 --> 07:22.976
- Move!

07:29.182 --> 07:31.519
- 90 seconds.
That's 90 seconds.

07:31.519 --> 07:32.953
Drones are gonna be coming!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.057
- Pull out!

07:37.090 --> 07:38.959

07:38.992 --> 07:40.794
- Pull out!
- Get to the car!

07:40.828 --> 07:42.429
Drones coming in!

08:01.649 --> 08:01.882
.

08:01.915 --> 08:02.916
- We're too exposed.
We need to get out of the open.

08:04.552 --> 08:05.919
- Yeah, no shit.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.187
- We shouldn't have
ditched the car.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.622
We shouldn't be on foot!

08:08.656 --> 08:10.558
- Were you in the military,
law enforcement?

08:10.558 --> 08:12.092
- No.
- Right.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.561
- Still, I don't think this
is a good idea.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.096
- Listen to me. Those people
were coming after you.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.665
And if they find you,
they're gonna torture you,

08:17.698 --> 08:19.099
and then they're gonna
kill you.

08:19.132 --> 08:21.468
You want to stay alive?

08:21.569 --> 08:23.937
Then today I don't work for you.
You work for me, got it?

08:23.971 --> 08:25.372
- Okay.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.974
Thank you...

08:27.007 --> 08:28.642
for saving me.
Thank you.

08:28.676 --> 08:31.044
- Just keep moving.
- Okay.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.479
- Where are we going?

08:32.580 --> 08:35.215
- Someplace safe.

08:44.157 --> 08:46.359
- Shit.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.021
- [sighs]

09:20.661 --> 09:23.997
Come on. Come on.

09:24.031 --> 09:25.432
Come on.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.335
Come on. Come on.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.904
[door rattling loudly]

09:30.938 --> 09:31.972
- Who is it?

09:32.005 --> 09:33.506
- Katie?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.843
Katie, open the door!

09:39.713 --> 09:41.849
- What...happened?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.183
- We got ambushed.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.053
Is the rest of the bar locked?
- Yeah.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.957
Ambushed?

09:52.225 --> 09:53.761
- It was an abduction attempt,
I think.

09:53.794 --> 09:57.665
- It's a coup.
I knew this was going to happen.

09:57.665 --> 10:00.033
It's a viper's nest up there.
You haven no idea.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.201
- We don't know
it's a coup.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.770
- Then how do you explain all my

10:02.803 --> 10:05.372
former Red-hatted friends
trying to kill me?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.374
- Could be Resistance.

10:07.407 --> 10:11.144
- You think the Resistance
got inside Homeland Security?

10:11.178 --> 10:14.214
- I think that food-truck raid
was a dress rehearsal for this.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.383
I didn't want to bring him here.
It's the only place close by.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.285
I had to get him off the street.
- Did anyone follow you?

10:18.318 --> 10:19.552
- I hope not.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.454
Can you call the drones
or something?

10:21.488 --> 10:24.057
- Even kings have limits
to their power, Will.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.695
- We're gonna have to hole up
here till help arrives.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.330
- No. No more Redhats.
We can't trust them.

10:30.363 --> 10:31.999
- I've got to call
the Task Force.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.134
- We can't trust them either.
Nothing goes over the air.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.669
- Well, we can't hide
in here forever.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.505
- I promise you, as we speak,
everyone loyal to me

10:38.538 --> 10:39.506
is hitting the streets.

10:39.539 --> 10:40.908
We just have to wait it out.

10:40.941 --> 10:42.676
- Well, I hope your cavalry
moves fast,

10:42.710 --> 10:44.311
'cause whoever organized
this operation

10:44.344 --> 10:47.047
put a lot of time
and resources into it.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.148
And they're gonna be
looking door-to-door

10:48.181 --> 10:49.316
for the prize they missed.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.718
Could be only
a matter of time

10:50.751 --> 10:52.652
before the bread crumbs
lead them here.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.021
- Mm-hmm.

10:54.054 --> 10:56.323
- I'm gonna call Beau.
- "Magnum P.I."?

10:56.356 --> 10:58.726
- Beau's good.
- No, Lagarza. I want Lagarza.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.360
- Will, we need to call someone,

11:00.393 --> 11:02.495
and there's a phone
in my office.

11:07.167 --> 11:08.969
- Stay away from the windows.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.847
- Are you crazy?

11:19.880 --> 11:21.915
You're risking your life
for that man?

11:21.949 --> 11:26.486
- Should I have left him there
in the street to die?

11:26.519 --> 11:29.189
The last thing I wanted to do
is get you caught up in this.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.991
What are you doing here
so early?

11:31.024 --> 11:33.526
- I came in
to do inventory.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.998
That's dead.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.168
The Authority never switched it
back on.

11:49.042 --> 11:52.012
- Did you talk to Lagarza?
- Phone's dead.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.114
- No, landlines
are all supposed to work.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.016
- Well, they don't.
- Where are you going?

11:56.049 --> 11:57.650
- To find a pay phone.
- Will...

11:57.684 --> 11:59.152
- [groans]

11:59.186 --> 12:01.554
- Jesus.
Will, you're bleeding.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.390
- I got tagged
by a bullet fragment.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.792
- You need a doctor.
- It can wait.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.226
- No, no, no, let me go
for help.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.395
I can go out the back.
- You can't leave.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.963
- I can't?

12:09.997 --> 12:12.032
- Look, we don't know
what's out there.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.801
I'm not gonna bleed to death.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.804
When I get back, I'll teach you
how to be field medic.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.872
I'm fine.
It's blood, not guts.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.207
- But you just said yourself

12:20.240 --> 12:21.708
that we don't know
what's out there.

12:21.809 --> 12:24.111
- I've got to call in
the cavalry.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.913
- Okay, there's a pay phone

12:25.946 --> 12:29.249
three blocks, four blocks
east of here.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.952
Here.
- You--you can't just leave me.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.621
- You want to go home?

12:35.989 --> 12:38.926
I'll be right back.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.096
[grunts in pain]

12:58.178 --> 13:00.013
- We should probably wait
in my office

13:00.047 --> 13:03.016
in case somebody comes
looking for you.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.590
- I know you don't like me.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.226
But this isn't my fault.

13:13.260 --> 13:16.129
- We're all misunderstood.

13:24.872 --> 13:28.475
[indistinct chatter
in the distance]

13:34.281 --> 13:35.782
- Thanks.
- Heller?

13:39.286 --> 13:42.089
- It was a bad day.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.756
- Yeah.

13:52.432 --> 13:56.103
- You okay?
- Got through clean.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.607
- You know, it's okay
to feel something.

14:00.640 --> 14:03.410
[door opens]

14:05.012 --> 14:08.448
[door closes]

14:08.481 --> 14:11.618
- Hey.
What the hell happened?

14:11.651 --> 14:13.120
- Will was with him
in the car.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.022
Pulled some cowboy shit
and got Snyder out

14:15.055 --> 14:16.489
before the drones arrived.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.458
- Will managed all that alone?

14:18.491 --> 14:20.994
- He just needed to buy himself
98 seconds.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.362
I searched the area on foot,

14:22.395 --> 14:24.197
but he got away
in the target vehicle.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.833
I'm sure they ditched it.
They could be anywhere by now.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.135
- We had him.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.137
- We need to reconsider
our options.

14:30.170 --> 14:32.205
- We cannot walk away
from this.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.806
- Broussard.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.142
- Not now!

14:35.175 --> 14:37.177
- It's important, sir.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.179
- What is it, Vasquez?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.014
- It's Katie.
She's asking for you.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.653
- Hey.
You all right?

14:46.686 --> 14:48.355
- I know where Snyder is.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.792
- Where?

14:55.428 --> 14:57.397
- This doesn't change
our agreement.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.866
Will is off-limits.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.270
I need to hear you say it.

15:06.539 --> 15:08.475
- Will is off-limits.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.980
- I have Snyder alone
at the Yonk.

15:25.058 --> 15:25.292
.

15:25.325 --> 15:28.761
[toy rattling]

15:38.605 --> 15:40.840
- You grew up in the South?

15:40.873 --> 15:44.377
- I grew up all over.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.179
I spent a lot
of time there, though.

15:46.213 --> 15:47.447
Navy brat.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.182
- Must have made
your father happy--

15:49.216 --> 15:51.751
your marrying
into the military.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.621
- You should ask
my Navy captain father

15:54.654 --> 15:58.258
how he felt about me marrying
an enlisted Army grunt.

15:59.592 --> 16:02.129
- Where does your family
live now?

16:02.162 --> 16:04.031
- New Orleans...

16:06.033 --> 16:09.502
If it's still around.

16:09.536 --> 16:13.440
- I honestly have no idea.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.542
- Okay.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.680
And how did you get involved
in all this?

16:20.713 --> 16:22.382
I mean, putting aside
the conspiracy theories

16:22.415 --> 16:24.051
that this was planned
for decades

16:24.051 --> 16:25.518
and our government was
somehow complicit--

16:25.552 --> 16:29.322
Somebody must have
approached you, right?

16:29.356 --> 16:33.226
Or recruited you
before handing you a crown.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.696
- I was the provost
at Stanford--

16:36.729 --> 16:40.200
greatest university
in the world.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.969
They needed someone that could
get their arms

16:43.070 --> 16:44.537
around a new form
of government,

16:44.571 --> 16:48.875
bring about order
and control quickly, peacefully.

16:48.908 --> 16:51.278
- They came to you
before the Arrival?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.382
- After.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.819
- Well, what about all
the other public officials

16:59.852 --> 17:03.090
who actually had experience
with that kind of thing.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.092
Are they all dead?
- I don't know.

17:05.092 --> 17:07.460
But my PhD in economics

17:07.494 --> 17:11.598
and my experience in running
a $5.1 billion operating budget

17:11.631 --> 17:15.868
meant that I was nicely suited
for their administrative needs.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.272
- So you're from up north?

17:19.306 --> 17:21.674
- No, I'm from Long Island--
go, Jets--

17:21.708 --> 17:23.943
but I lived in Palo Alto.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.978
- So how did you get to LA?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.183
- They relocated me.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.684
- So we're not
the only colony.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.586
- There are others.
- How many?

17:33.620 --> 17:36.989
- The Pacific Coast region--

17:37.023 --> 17:39.359
California, Oregon,
and Washington--

17:39.392 --> 17:41.328
has seven colonies.

17:41.361 --> 17:45.732
But beyond that, I meant it
when I said I have no idea.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.804
- What about all the land
between the colonies?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.706
What's out there?

17:53.740 --> 17:57.710
- That's somewhere
you do not want to be.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.879
- Why?
What's the--

17:59.912 --> 18:02.749
[door opens, creaks]

18:02.782 --> 18:04.617
[door closes]

18:13.160 --> 18:15.195
- Hey.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.597
- You got back fast.
- I cut through the alleyway.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.599
I remembered there was
a pay phone on Fairbanks.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.169
- Did you get a hold of Lagarza?
- He's 25 minutes out.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.070
Well, make that 21 now.

18:24.171 --> 18:28.808
- 20? He knows he doesn't have
to stop at the lights, right?

18:28.841 --> 18:31.278
- Will, 20 minutes--
we can't stay here.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.280
What if they're out
searching door-to-door?

18:33.313 --> 18:34.281
- We'll be fine.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.416
You ready to patch me up?

18:36.449 --> 18:37.950
- Yes.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.224
- [grunts]

18:44.257 --> 18:45.825
That's not
the good stuff, is it?

18:45.858 --> 18:47.660
- It's only the best
for you, baby.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.429
- [chuckles]

18:49.462 --> 18:52.832
Okay, clean off
most of the blood.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.742
[grunts]
Okay.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.511
Now get a clean towel.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.347
Cut a strip
about six inches wide.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.219
- Do you think this attack
was retribution

19:12.219 --> 19:13.853
from Geronimo's followers?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.087
- I doubt it.

19:15.121 --> 19:18.090
- Why?

19:18.124 --> 19:22.094
- Geronimo's not the folk hero
everyone thinks he is.

19:22.128 --> 19:24.731
- How so?

19:24.764 --> 19:26.766
- Okay, wrap that tight.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.139
Tight.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.417
[groans, sighs]

19:47.554 --> 19:49.121
That's good.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.258
I think you just earned
a merit badge.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.726
- [chuckles]

19:56.829 --> 19:59.399
Will, this is our chance.

19:59.432 --> 20:02.535
We should give Snyder up
to whoever's looking for him.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.237
- And then what?

20:04.271 --> 20:08.875
- Snyder is an asshole who
deserves what's coming to him.

20:08.908 --> 20:13.546
All we have to do
is step out of the way.

20:13.580 --> 20:17.350
- And then another bureaucrat
with a new agenda replaces him.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.188
Snyder is the devil we know.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.963
- How's the arm?

20:30.997 --> 20:33.633
- I'll live.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.936
- I know that this isn't
an ideal situation...

20:36.969 --> 20:38.605
for a lot of reasons.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.073
But I'm a good friend
to have.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.675
- Yeah, I know.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.677
- I was gonna tell you this
at our meeting today.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.614
I'm very happy to relay
that my contacts in Santa Monica

20:47.647 --> 20:51.451
have just confirmed
your son, Charlie, is alive.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.154
- How do you know that?

20:55.187 --> 20:57.424
- Because
I keep my promises.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.991
- If you are lying
about this--

20:59.025 --> 21:00.860
- Are they bringing
him back?

21:00.893 --> 21:03.596
- I know you don't understand
or necessarily care

21:03.630 --> 21:06.699
about inter-colony politics,
but it's very complicated.

21:06.733 --> 21:09.135
There's a ton of red tape
and bureaucracy.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.340
All right, look...
[clears throat]

21:13.373 --> 21:15.708
I don't have the power
to navigate this on my own.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.110
- Of course you don't.
- But I'm working on it.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.746
Understand that I am really

21:19.779 --> 21:21.614
exposing myself here
for you guys.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.384
This is not something I would do
for anyone else.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.053
- What are you doing?
- Negotiating...

21:27.086 --> 21:29.188
with the Chief of Staff
to the Governor General

21:29.221 --> 21:31.558
of the entire
Los Angeles colony.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.760
I was going to introduce you
to her before we got...

21:33.793 --> 21:35.227
waylaid.

21:35.261 --> 21:37.196
- What's her name?
- Helena Goldwyn.

21:37.229 --> 21:40.199
She has the power to make this
whole Charlie thing happen.

21:40.232 --> 21:42.268
- How do we know
you're not just saying this

21:42.369 --> 21:43.870
to get what you want?

21:43.903 --> 21:45.938
- Come on, Katie, give me
a little credit.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.474
This is family.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.975
- Mm-hmm.

21:49.008 --> 21:51.611
- I wouldn't lie
about something like that.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.914
I promise you, I'm on your side,
and I want to see this happen

21:54.947 --> 21:56.416
just as much--

21:56.449 --> 22:00.052
All right, okay,
that's probably impossible,

22:00.086 --> 22:03.456
but I really want to help you
get him back.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.292
I just need to make it
out of this little predicament

22:06.393 --> 22:08.395
if I'm going to keep
that ball rolling.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.232
[pounding on door]

22:13.265 --> 22:15.067
- In the bathroom.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.877
[pounding on door]

22:35.254 --> 22:36.689
- I'm sorry, Officer.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.425
We've had some attempts
on our liquor supply.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.159
I'm just being careful.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.894
- Ma'am, if you have
any safety issues,

22:41.928 --> 22:44.096
you need to report them to
Homeland Security immediately.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.432
We'll handle them.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.834
- Of course.
What can I do for you?

22:47.867 --> 22:49.669
- I need you
to let me inside.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.671
- Do you mind
telling me why?

22:51.704 --> 22:53.740
- We're looking
for a missing person.

22:53.773 --> 22:56.443
- Who?
- Can't say.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.110
Please, ma'am.

22:58.144 --> 23:00.112
I don't want to have
to force my way in.

23:13.159 --> 23:16.028
- It's just me here.
I'm...

23:16.062 --> 23:18.531
just prepping for tonight.

23:18.565 --> 23:22.134
- Still need to clear
the building.

23:22.168 --> 23:26.473
- Well, obviously, this is
the main room.

23:26.473 --> 23:29.041
- Need to see
them all, ma'am.

23:29.075 --> 23:31.343
- Of course.

23:31.377 --> 23:35.381
Uh, my office, down here...

23:35.482 --> 23:39.486
the patio, the bathrooms,
and the kitchen.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.977
[door creaks, closes]

24:10.316 --> 24:11.818
That's about it.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.253
I'm sorry I couldn't be
more helpful.

24:14.286 --> 24:17.156
- [knocking on wall]
What's this?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.391
- That's just the basement--
storage.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.761
- Need to look there
too, ma'am.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.635
- Okay.

24:31.337 --> 24:34.440
- Lead the way.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.046
[door creaks, closes]

24:52.158 --> 24:54.561
- Snyder's in the men's room.
- I know.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.862
- Will called Special Ops.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.797
The Red Berets are
on their way for Snyder.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.165
- We need to get
to him first, then.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.332
- Will's right upstairs.

25:00.366 --> 25:03.435
- Quayle sees Snyder
as the priority.

25:03.469 --> 25:05.672
If you can't get him out,
Quayle's gonna come in.

25:05.705 --> 25:06.939
- You gave me your word.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.375
- All Quayle wants is Snyder.

25:09.408 --> 25:13.079
Get him out the back door,
and this all ends.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.019
Sorry for
the disturbance, ma'am.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.989
Thank you
for your cooperation.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.960
- Don't mention it.

25:36.302 --> 25:39.939
- Best to lock the doors
after I leave.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.974
If you have any more trouble,
pick up the phone and dial 0

25:42.008 --> 25:44.744
to reach
Homeland Security, ma'am.

25:44.777 --> 25:48.047
- Will do.
Thank you.

25:48.080 --> 25:50.482
- Take care, ma'am.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.631
- [exhales deeply]

26:08.200 --> 26:10.069
- You did great.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.904
- I don't know.

26:11.938 --> 26:16.008
Proxy Snyder is missing, and
that guy's out searching alone?

26:16.042 --> 26:18.010
Redhats don't do
anything alone.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.211
What do you think?

26:19.245 --> 26:20.680
- I think that guy
was Resistance.

26:20.713 --> 26:23.182
- Do you think we fooled him?

26:45.672 --> 26:45.905
.

26:45.938 --> 26:46.205
- [sighs]

26:47.573 --> 26:49.508
Can you help me
with this one?

26:49.541 --> 26:51.210
- Yeah.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.922
- Okay, uh, now what?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.424
You make some homemade bombs
or some booby traps

27:05.457 --> 27:06.425
or something, right?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.294
- Nope.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.697
- Th--this is it?
This is the plan?

27:10.697 --> 27:13.766
- [sighs] We got about seven
minutes till Lagarza's ETA.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.268
If they come in, we just got
to slow them down.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.705
- Slow them down?
How?

27:18.705 --> 27:21.007
- I'm gonna hole up here...

27:21.040 --> 27:25.044
shoot whoever comes
through those doors.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.714
- I'm having a drink.
Anyone else?

27:38.590 --> 27:41.894
- You still believe
anything that man says?

27:41.928 --> 27:44.563
- I have to believe him...

27:44.596 --> 27:46.165
because I don't know
what else there is.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.868
- Even if it risks your life?
Our lives?

27:52.604 --> 27:55.875
- Everything we have
is tied to him.

27:55.908 --> 27:59.645
- I'd like to remind everyone
who might be paying attention

27:59.746 --> 28:04.150
that I rescued your husband
and all the rest of you

28:04.183 --> 28:07.653
from a life of misery
and imprisonment.

28:07.754 --> 28:09.922
If you want me to continue
to be helpful

28:09.956 --> 28:13.092
in retrieving your son...

28:13.125 --> 28:14.761
- You son of a bitch!

28:14.794 --> 28:16.595
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- I'm so sick...

28:16.628 --> 28:18.931
of your threats
to my family!

28:18.965 --> 28:21.067
- Hey, get her off me!

28:21.100 --> 28:23.102
Hey--aah!

28:25.037 --> 28:26.472
- Jesus!

28:26.505 --> 28:28.841
- Hold it.
- What the hell are you doing?

28:28.875 --> 28:31.143
- Let's see how long he survives
without us!

28:36.015 --> 28:39.085
- I realize that we are all
in an unusually stressful

28:39.118 --> 28:44.190
situation...that does not bring
out the best in us,

28:44.223 --> 28:46.926
so I'm willing to forget this.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.428
That's because
I'm a reasonable man.

28:49.461 --> 28:52.498
And if you think otherwise,
then you really don't want to

28:52.531 --> 28:57.336
meet the people who spend their
days plotting to take my seat.

28:57.369 --> 29:01.173
I'm sorry to be the bearer of
unpleasant truths, Katie--

29:01.207 --> 29:03.575
but I'm the best there is.

29:03.609 --> 29:06.412
And I really am trying
to help you.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.288
[beep]
- Situation report.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.390
[beep]

29:18.424 --> 29:19.959
- We're close. She has him.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.028
- What are you waiting for?

29:22.061 --> 29:23.863
- Well, we made a deal with her.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.932
And you confirmed it.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.868
- Will put himself in the line
of fire the day he put on red.

29:28.901 --> 29:31.203
He's a soldier.
He accepted that.

29:31.237 --> 29:32.972
- Katie hasn't.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.741
- Do I need to remind you
of the chain of command?

29:35.842 --> 29:38.845
Bring Snyder out.

29:50.122 --> 29:52.591
- No Homeland patrols.
Drones, either.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.862
You sure they care
you're missing?

29:55.862 --> 29:58.497
- They're coming for me, Will.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.768
Homeland Security is just...
trained to be discreet.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.471
- [scoffs]

30:05.504 --> 30:07.173
Well...there's one.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.740
- One what?

30:08.774 --> 30:09.976
- Redhat.

30:10.009 --> 30:12.778
- Good Redhat or bad Redhat?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.481
- I don't know.

30:15.514 --> 30:17.116
- This should be impossible.

30:17.149 --> 30:18.817
All of them were screened
for this.

30:18.851 --> 30:20.686
- What do you mean, screened?

30:20.719 --> 30:25.791
- Every person in the colony was
filtered through this algorithm.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.426
It's how they knew
who to select

30:27.459 --> 30:29.661
and what to do with them.

30:29.695 --> 30:33.032
- They used the data
from the Rolodex?

30:33.065 --> 30:35.334
- Our hosts know everything
about us.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.137
Well, knew everything.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.772
They had our entire data record
when they arrived.

30:40.806 --> 30:43.375
We gave them the keys
to the kingdom.

30:43.409 --> 30:44.710
- That how they found you?

30:44.743 --> 30:46.112
- When they approached me,

30:46.145 --> 30:48.147
they told me I was
the perfect candidate.

30:51.750 --> 30:53.585
- You've met them?

30:59.025 --> 31:00.526
What are they like?

31:02.728 --> 31:05.731
- It's a humbling moment,

31:05.764 --> 31:09.701
realizing...just how
insignificant we all are

31:09.735 --> 31:11.603
in the universe.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.142
[thudding, footsteps]

31:16.175 --> 31:17.709
- They're upstairs?

31:17.743 --> 31:19.211
- They're setting spotters.

31:19.245 --> 31:21.313
Or maybe snipers to shoot us
if we run out.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.515
- Katie, they're coming!

31:26.618 --> 31:28.387
- You, office.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.956
You, basement.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.623
- I'm not leaving you
up here alone.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.260
- This is what I do, Katie.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.295
- Let me help you.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.231
- Not here, not this.
You need to go downstairs.

31:39.265 --> 31:42.001
For the kids.

31:42.034 --> 31:44.270
You're going home tonight.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.038
- Will--
- Go. Now.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.809
[tense music]

31:50.842 --> 31:53.112
*

32:03.589 --> 32:03.855
.

32:03.889 --> 32:06.125
[thudding]

32:28.014 --> 32:29.115
- Uhh!

32:36.488 --> 32:37.923
- Aah--uhh!

32:50.036 --> 32:53.072
[tense music]

32:53.105 --> 32:57.443
*

32:57.476 --> 32:59.078
[gunshots]

33:07.153 --> 33:08.854
- Ugh.

33:18.664 --> 33:21.200
- Drop the weapon.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.069
Not another step.

33:25.771 --> 33:28.207
- Drop your gun.

33:31.243 --> 33:32.344
- Katie.

33:33.679 --> 33:36.182
- 25 feet, high stress...

33:36.215 --> 33:38.650
Doubt you'll make
that shot clean.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.619
I know I will.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.996
- Katie, put the gun down.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.099
It's okay.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.877
- Where's Snyder?

34:07.979 --> 34:09.548
- Office.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.688
- Move.

34:56.195 --> 34:58.897
- No, Will...Will!

35:07.573 --> 35:10.242
[sirens pulsing]

35:11.610 --> 35:13.445
- Go! Move, move!
- Go, go, go!

35:13.479 --> 35:15.314
- Freeze!
- Drop the weapon!

35:15.347 --> 35:17.082
- Easy, easy.
Homeland Security.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.985
Have you seen a Redhat?

35:20.018 --> 35:21.620
A guy, he--he's dressed
like you.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.389
He came through here.
- No, sir.

35:23.422 --> 35:24.490
Move it!
Let's go!

35:24.523 --> 35:26.558
Come on, men, on me,
on me!

35:26.592 --> 35:30.662
[drones roaring]

35:35.033 --> 35:36.902
- Damn it!
- Cover that.

35:36.935 --> 35:37.936
Cover that!

35:39.838 --> 35:42.774
[men shouting distantly]

35:42.808 --> 35:44.643
- He's gone.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.745
[radio chatter]

35:46.778 --> 35:48.780
- Where is he?

35:48.814 --> 35:50.282
- He escaped.

35:51.450 --> 35:53.219
- Behind the bar.

35:53.219 --> 35:57.356
[background chatter,
radio chatter]

36:01.660 --> 36:03.529
- Back all clear.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.031
- Sir.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.906
- Whoever that guy was,

36:14.940 --> 36:17.276
I want him found...

36:17.309 --> 36:19.411
and I want him to die.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.714
Badly.

36:24.250 --> 36:27.253
Everything we have, Will.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.621
Throw it at him.

36:29.655 --> 36:32.891
[background chatter
continues]

36:56.282 --> 36:56.482
.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.484
[crickets chirping]

37:46.732 --> 37:49.935
- I know it's really bad
right now.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.837
But you have to
keep telling yourself

37:51.870 --> 37:53.705
that you did what you
had to do.

37:53.739 --> 37:56.207
That he put you
in that position.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.981
- Do you think
Geronimo's followers

38:03.014 --> 38:04.650
will come after us for today?

38:04.683 --> 38:06.485
- I know they won't.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.155
- How?

38:10.188 --> 38:13.359
- Because Geronimo's
not a terrorist.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.861
He's some ad-guy
up in the Green Zone.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.868
Snyder's trial was a farce.

38:26.071 --> 38:28.540
The only thing Geronimo
ever led

38:28.574 --> 38:31.410
was a really smart
street-art campaign.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.381
Some people down here rallied
around the message,

38:35.381 --> 38:37.182
used it for violence.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.120
But the folk hero
in the headdress...

38:42.153 --> 38:44.390
he doesn't exist.

38:46.392 --> 38:50.529
The people who pulled this thing
off today...

38:50.562 --> 38:53.098
now, they're something else.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.538
Homeland's across the street.

38:59.571 --> 39:04.109
They'll be watching everything
that goes on here now.

39:04.142 --> 39:07.012
- I'm fine, Will. Go.

39:17.756 --> 39:19.425
- Hey.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.095
You're my hero.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.833
I love you.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.168
- I love you.

39:44.015 --> 39:46.284
- So where are we?

39:46.317 --> 39:49.020
- In the wind.
Garage is closed.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.990
I sent everyone left
into hiding.

39:54.192 --> 39:57.796
- Well...at least we know.

39:59.531 --> 40:01.032
- Know?

40:02.734 --> 40:07.272
- The armory, Kim's house,
today.

40:07.305 --> 40:10.341
It all tracks now.

40:10.375 --> 40:12.444
Katie fed us bullshit.

40:12.478 --> 40:15.881
And then she helped her husband
take us apart.

40:17.215 --> 40:20.819
Look at me and tell me
you don't see it.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.193
She's a double agent.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.729
[dramatic music]

[curfew sirens wail]
