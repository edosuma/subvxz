WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.704
(church organ playing)

00:13.514 --> 00:15.216
Give me that thing.

00:15.249 --> 00:17.385
You color
like a mental patient.
Maw Maw.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.719
If you continue
to embarrass us,

00:18.752 --> 00:20.188
we're going to start
dropping you off

00:20.221 --> 00:21.255
at the Korean church again.

00:21.289 --> 00:23.091
She's a terrible drawer.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.525
She made Joseph all blue.

00:24.558 --> 00:26.760
And Mary's got
furry monkey arms.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.096
So what?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.563
Maybe she had hairy arms.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.499
It's probably why she
stayed a virgin.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.201
WOMAN:
Good morning.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.602
I'd like to mention

00:34.635 --> 00:37.105
that one of my
Heaven's Helpers volunteers

00:37.138 --> 00:39.373
did a wonderful job
on beautifying

00:39.407 --> 00:40.608
the church's landscaping.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.775
Here it comes.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.511
Does this face
look humble?

00:43.544 --> 00:45.779
It's all a part of the
Spring into Spring campaign

00:45.813 --> 00:47.548
that I organized.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.717
I'd like to recognize
the parishioner

00:49.750 --> 00:54.188
who donated his time and talent
for this project.

00:54.222 --> 00:56.157
But...

00:56.190 --> 00:58.359
he doesn't do it
for the recognition.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.361
None of my volunteers here do.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.397
They follow the example
that I set.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.699
I don't do it for the glory.

01:05.733 --> 01:08.236
I do it for the Lordy.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.874
No. It's not about me,

01:13.907 --> 01:15.376
but thank you.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.112
So you'll be happy to know

01:18.146 --> 01:20.214
that I will run for another term

01:20.248 --> 01:22.550
as chairperson
of Heaven's Helpers.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.618
I'll formally accept
my nomination

01:24.652 --> 01:27.688
next Tuesday,
right after Bible hymn karaoke.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.257
*

01:31.892 --> 01:34.328
Are those pesos?

01:34.362 --> 01:35.729
Yeah.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.233
I won a bet from a gal at work.
It's all she had.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.435
Don't worry-- if Jesus
turned water into wine,

01:41.469 --> 01:43.537
I'm sure he can turn
pesos into dollars.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.173
(chuckles)

01:46.740 --> 01:48.642
VIRGINIA:
All right, Jimmy, come on.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.278
It's time to put on
your costume.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.479
Costume for what?

01:51.512 --> 01:52.880
You'll think it's weird,

01:52.913 --> 01:54.748
but ever since we stopped
getting the Sunday paper,

01:54.782 --> 01:56.584
we started making up
and acting out our own funnies.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.519
(grunts)

01:58.552 --> 02:02.290
I don't really feel like doing
the comics this morning.

02:02.323 --> 02:03.657
Oh, come on, Burt.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.293
You know I've been waiting
all week for this.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.927
Yeah, I was waiting
all week for a little

02:06.960 --> 02:08.629
acknowledgment for my
church volunteer work.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.464
I was even practicing all this.

02:11.765 --> 02:12.933
Sarah Louise
is running for reelection.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.502
You should run
against her.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.504
Then, when you're in charge,
you can make sure

02:16.537 --> 02:17.871
everybody gets
the credit they deserve.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.174
No way.
Do not cross Sarah Louise.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.942
You remember what happened
when Ernie Sawyer

02:21.975 --> 02:23.911
ran against her,
and then he fell off the wagon?

02:23.944 --> 02:25.346
She made him
start drinking?

02:25.379 --> 02:26.647
No, she scared the horses,

02:26.680 --> 02:28.349
and he flew off the back
of the hayride.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.684
He was drunk, though.

02:30.718 --> 02:31.885
But they say that's
what saved him.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.954
Maybe I should
run against her.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.856
It's time someone
stood up to Sarah Louise.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.225
SABRINA:
Hey. If you run
against her,

02:37.258 --> 02:38.526
I'll be your campaign manager.

02:38.559 --> 02:40.361
But only if you let me
go negative, 'cause I just

02:40.394 --> 02:41.529
don't think we can win
on your accomplishments.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.530
VIRGINIA:
You know what?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.198
I was going to start

02:44.232 --> 02:45.666
with Beetle Bailey this week,
but I think you need

02:45.699 --> 02:46.834
to learn a very important lesson

02:46.867 --> 02:48.035
from some of America's
favorite kids.

02:48.068 --> 02:50.170
Just give me five minutes
to rewrite this week's script.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.274
VIRGINIA:
Okay.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.677
(Vince Guaraldi's
"Linus and Lucy" plays)

02:56.710 --> 02:57.945
VIRGINIA:
Is everybody ready?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.079
I really
should be Marcie.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.316
I'm the only one with
an actual lesbian experience.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.884
Maw Maw, I've told you before,
watching Ellen

03:03.917 --> 03:06.720
isn't considered
a lesbian experience, okay?

03:06.754 --> 03:07.755
Ready? Go.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.922
Come on, Charlie Brown.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.392
Do it. You'd be
everyone's hero.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.327
Yeah, trust me, Charlie Brown.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.728
You guys are right.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.530
I think I can do it.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.332
What's the worst thing
that can happen?

03:18.366 --> 03:20.468
(chuckling)

03:22.470 --> 03:24.438
BURT:
Aah!

03:24.472 --> 03:26.340
(laughing)

03:26.374 --> 03:28.342
(groaning)

03:28.376 --> 03:29.810
VIRGINIA:
This is exactly
what will happen

03:29.843 --> 03:32.480
if you run against Sarah Louise.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.582
(groaning)

03:40.020 --> 03:42.290
Good grief.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.293
Whoo!

03:45.326 --> 03:46.627
* Here we go

03:46.660 --> 03:49.663
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

03:49.697 --> 03:51.732
(electric organ playing)

03:56.470 --> 03:58.972
Well, I'd like to start
the meeting, but, apparently,

03:59.006 --> 04:01.041
Carl's sister is running late
to pick him up.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.042
Poor blind fellow.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.777
Music's all he's got.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.045
And he's not as good

04:05.078 --> 04:07.715
as most blind musicians
I've seen on TV.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.683
Hey, my ears work, okay?

04:09.717 --> 04:12.019
As does my middle finger.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.588
Poor thing.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.957
He's flipping the bird
to a poster of Bethlehem.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.827
Thanks, Virginia.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.529
Oh, she's in
the crosshairs now.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.030
All right.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.498
Everybody saw it.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.367
You can put it
down, Carl.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.936
Tonight's first order
of business

04:28.969 --> 04:31.405
will be to formally
nominate candidates

04:31.439 --> 04:34.007
for chairperson
of Heaven's Helpers.

04:34.041 --> 04:35.876
Put it down, Carl.

04:38.011 --> 04:41.014
Do it. Nominate me.
No. It's a suicide mission.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.517
Since I'm unopposed again...

04:43.551 --> 04:45.018
I nominate Burt Chance.

04:45.052 --> 04:45.886
(plays dramatic flourish)

04:47.087 --> 04:48.489
(whispering):
Thank you, Carl.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.557
(laughing)

04:49.590 --> 04:51.692
Okay.
(Burt chuckles)

04:51.725 --> 04:53.694
Good for you, Burt.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.663
In two weeks,
at the next meeting,

04:55.696 --> 04:58.666
both of us
will make brief speeches,

04:58.699 --> 05:00.868
and all members in attendance
will vote.

05:00.901 --> 05:01.902
(sighs)
Sorry I'm late.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.672
My mouthwash
gave my Breathalyzer

05:04.705 --> 05:07.341
a false reading,
so my car wouldn't start.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.041
(whispering):
Bye, Carl.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.745
He's good.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.515
As some of you may have heard,

05:14.548 --> 05:16.417
Carl's sister Gwen's
moving away.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.051
Rehab.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.488
Luckily for him, I stepped in.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.090
Next week, Heaven's Helpers
will present Carl

05:23.123 --> 05:24.758
with his very own guide animal.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.059
Isn't that wonderful?

05:26.994 --> 05:29.430
We do, however, need someone

05:29.463 --> 05:31.665
to care for the animal
until the presentation.

05:31.699 --> 05:32.966
No.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.503
I spend half the week
vacuuming up Maw Maw's hair.

05:35.536 --> 05:36.804
I'm not adding an animal.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.440
I would do it myself, but...

05:39.473 --> 05:41.775
since I'm sure Burt
would like to prove

05:41.809 --> 05:44.412
to everyone
that he can be in charge...

05:44.445 --> 05:47.615
I would really love
to help out here,

05:47.648 --> 05:50.784
but, uh, unfortunately,
I am allergic to dogs.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.386
Well, praise the Lord.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.921
Carl is, too.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.055
(snorting)

05:55.088 --> 05:56.724
I hate that pig.

05:56.757 --> 05:57.925
Me, too.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.092
We're talking
about Sarah Louise, right?

05:59.126 --> 06:00.761
'Cause this one
seems pretty nice.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.095
(chuckling)

06:06.099 --> 06:08.135
(snorting)

06:08.168 --> 06:09.970
Mom, you should've
been on that walk.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.905
Hope loves
having a pet.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.807
Maw Maw put her
on Mr. Curly Tail's back,

06:13.841 --> 06:16.009
and it... it looked
just like a little rodeo.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.411
I mean, you know,
if cowboys

06:17.445 --> 06:19.012
in rodeos had
giant old ladies

06:19.046 --> 06:20.147
behind them
holding them on.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.417
You had to be there.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.053
Burt, this isn't going to be
as easy as you think.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.921
This thing is full

06:27.955 --> 06:29.890
of special care
instructions.

06:29.923 --> 06:32.460
Purified water?

06:32.493 --> 06:35.463
Pesticide-free fruits
and vegetables?

06:35.496 --> 06:38.098
You think you're better
than us, don't you?

06:38.131 --> 06:39.199
(laughs) Hey, guys.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.535
I just heard that one
of your neighbors got a pig.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.471
And now you're not
the trashiest people on the...
(pig squeals)

06:46.574 --> 06:47.708
Sorry.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.076
BURT:
In just five days,

06:49.109 --> 06:50.611
they're going
to present that to Carl.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.845
We spent longer than that

06:51.879 --> 06:53.814
trying to win
a "hands on a Jet Ski" contest.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.816
And we would have won, too,
if they hadn't have let

06:55.849 --> 06:57.217
that jerk with
the colostomy bag enter.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.819
Plus, it'll give me great stuff
to brag about

06:58.852 --> 07:00.488
in two weeks
when I make my big speech.

07:00.521 --> 07:04.592
Burt, you know how ruthless
Sarah Louise is.

07:04.625 --> 07:08.028
And you're not the
best public speaker.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.764
I just don't want
to see you get hurt.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.900
Hey, I could... I could help you
with your speech if you want.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.635
I-I learned a trick
in my public speaking course.

07:14.668 --> 07:16.036
If it's the old classic
"picture everybody naked,"

07:16.069 --> 07:17.605
you can forget about it.

07:17.638 --> 07:18.939
Burt always pictures
everybody naked.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.040
We both do.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.042
Some people have Cinemax.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.077
We have our imagination.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.880
JIMMY:
Living with a pig in your house
might sound crazy,

07:26.914 --> 07:29.683
but we all fell in love
with Mr. Curly Tail.

07:29.717 --> 07:31.184
Except Mom.

07:35.789 --> 07:37.457
(groans)

07:41.061 --> 07:43.030
Hey. Twins.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.532
(groans)

07:47.801 --> 07:49.670
(screams)

07:49.703 --> 07:50.871
He was cold.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.873
I was afraid he'd
get the swine flu.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.608
What...?

07:54.642 --> 07:57.210
Shh.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.218
He never saw Babe.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.558
Two out of three,
Mr. Curly Tail.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.225
(Maw Maw laughs,
Virginia whimpers)

08:14.862 --> 08:16.830
MAW MAW: No...!
(Virginia gasps)

08:19.667 --> 08:21.034
Hey, Virginia.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.103
Check this out.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.240
Curly, newspaper.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.543
Burt, we don't get
the newspaper.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.579
Oh, I know.
He steals it from the neighbors.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.646
Listen, I'm going down
to the grocery store.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.749
Sabrina's going to help me
with my very funny speech.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.785
There's no Polish people
in our church, right?

08:37.818 --> 08:39.119
You better be taking
that pig with you.

08:39.152 --> 08:39.987
I don't want to be alone
with him.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.789
You're not alone.
Maw Maw's right here.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.691
Unless she's dead.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.925
Nah. Alive.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.093
Leave him if you want.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.127
That stupid pig is on his own.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.729
I'm watching
this TV show

08:48.762 --> 08:49.897
where they find wedding dresses

08:49.930 --> 08:52.232
that look good
on oddly-shaped women.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.234
I think today's
got conjoined twins.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.169
Oh, that is a lucky groom.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.138
(snorting)

08:58.171 --> 08:59.707
(laughing)

08:59.740 --> 09:01.909
Come on, you got
to love this guy.
Ugh.

09:04.111 --> 09:07.014
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
Today, Beth tries on
gown number seven

09:07.047 --> 09:09.349
while her sister Tanya still
can't find a bridesmaid's dress

09:09.382 --> 09:11.018
that doesn't make
her hip look big.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.020
You hang in there, Tanya.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.187
Beth found her Mr. Right.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.624
You'll find your Mr. Left.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.162
(choking)

09:29.903 --> 09:32.940
(gasping)

09:34.041 --> 09:35.909
Holy crap, pig.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.178
You saved my life.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.749
You saved my life, pig.

09:41.782 --> 09:43.383
Oh, my God.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.254
You're like Lassie
without all the attitude.

09:47.287 --> 09:50.691
Not even my own grandmother
would wake up to save me.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.925
I was awake.

09:51.959 --> 09:52.926
Thought you were
trying to trick me

09:52.960 --> 09:55.228
into giving up the good chair.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.097
This couch is way more
comfortable than that chair.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.966
Oh.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.234
(choking)

10:04.772 --> 10:07.808
In conclusion,
fellow parishioners,

10:07.841 --> 10:11.712
I would like to be chairperson
of Heaven's Helpers

10:11.745 --> 10:13.180
so that you can get

10:13.213 --> 10:15.415
the credit that you deserve

10:15.448 --> 10:18.151
without making everything
about me.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.953
You're still kind of doing
this thing with your hands.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.254
Aah! Still?
VIRGINIA:
Burt!

10:21.288 --> 10:23.857
Burt, you were right
about Mr. Curly Tail.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.392
He is a genius.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.361
I was choking, and
he saved my life.

10:28.395 --> 10:29.963
I told you, he's a genius.

10:29.997 --> 10:31.298
I decided to come
and get Mr. Curly Tail

10:31.331 --> 10:32.800
some of those organic apples
you guys sell.

10:32.833 --> 10:33.867
We stopped selling
organic stuff.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.336
See, the produce is really
close to the restroom,

10:36.369 --> 10:37.805
and without pesticides,

10:37.838 --> 10:39.139
they just can't handle
the air fresheners.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.774
However,
our public restrooms

10:40.808 --> 10:42.442
were voted the
best-smelling in Natesville.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.745
Fine. Then I guess I'll
go out to that hippie farm

10:44.778 --> 10:45.879
and get some real
organic apples.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.214
Hey. How'd that, uh,

10:47.247 --> 10:48.315
conjoined twin's
wedding work out?

10:48.348 --> 10:50.017
Wild. At that part
in the wedding

10:50.050 --> 10:52.285
when they ask if anyone
has any objections,

10:52.319 --> 10:54.187
the bride's conjoined
twin admitted

10:54.221 --> 10:56.156
that she had slept
with the groom.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.091
(disappointed groan)

10:58.125 --> 11:01.428
I admit it, you were right,
and I was wrong.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.831
That really is one
magnificent pig.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.298
And you know what?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.234
I'm gonna let him sleep
in the bed tonight.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.137
Something smells good.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.874
Whoa.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.751
Maw Maw.

11:23.784 --> 11:26.186
Please tell us you didn't
butcher Mr. Curly Tail.

11:26.219 --> 11:27.788
Of course, I did.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.990
And if this is going to become
a regular thing,

11:30.023 --> 11:32.793
we're gonna need a bigger
freezer, sharper knives,

11:32.826 --> 11:34.427
and a much better mop.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.806
I can't eat him.

11:45.839 --> 11:46.940
He was a friend.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.241
Oh, get off it.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.210
I should've just told you
it ran away,

11:50.243 --> 11:52.179
and I bought this
at a store.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.447
It worked for
Jimmy's pet rabbits.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.950
You killed Floppy and Pom-Pom?

11:56.984 --> 11:58.218
And you ate 'em.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.519
Those rabbits were stupid
and worthless.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.822
This pig we're eating
was a hero.

12:01.855 --> 12:06.393
He saved my life,
and I couldn't save his.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.896
He was a damn good pig.
He makes a damn good chop.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.331
Burt.
Virginia, eat him or he
would've died in vain.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.133
He would've wanted
it this way.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.835
I'm sure Maw Maw made it
quick and painless.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.905
No, it was a hell of a struggle.

12:17.938 --> 12:22.209
It isn't easy trying to cut up
a pig with a pizza cutter.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.111
Oh, God. Okay.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.779
That did it for me.

12:25.813 --> 12:28.882
Who are you, and why are you
always in our house?

12:28.916 --> 12:30.083
I guess we should save some
for Carl

12:30.117 --> 12:31.218
so he gets something
out of this.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.353
We're gonna have to change
that speech we worked on.

12:33.386 --> 12:34.922
That's a pretty
significant rewrite.

12:34.955 --> 12:35.989
A lot of our best points

12:36.023 --> 12:38.125
were about how you kept that
pig alive for five days.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.459
Maybe you can just
change it to "four days."

12:39.492 --> 12:41.061
Are you insane?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.130
There is no speech,
there is no election.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.098
You are going
in there tomorrow

12:45.132 --> 12:47.000
saying you killed
a blind man's pig.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.969
Well, the election's not
for a week.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.303
Maybe they'll just forget.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.873
Seriously, who are you?

12:52.906 --> 12:55.976
Burt, look, we screwed up.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.945
Okay? Forget the election.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.246
This is what's gonna happen:

12:59.279 --> 13:00.814
We're gonna go
in there tomorrow,

13:00.848 --> 13:03.450
say what we did, and we're gonna
suffer the scorn,

13:03.483 --> 13:05.218
and we're gonna
do it as a family.

13:05.252 --> 13:08.021
I mean, we got through
the Easter fart.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.490
We got through Maw Maw dry-
humping the St. Francis statue.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.892
He was no saint.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.227
Should've seen the way
he was looking at me.

13:14.261 --> 13:18.498
Well, if tomorrow's our judgment
day, might as well enjoy now.

13:22.369 --> 13:24.271
(sighs)

13:24.304 --> 13:28.141
I'm only doing this so you'll
always be a part of me, okay?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.048
God, that is delicious.

13:35.082 --> 13:36.116
Mmm.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.886
(beeping)

13:38.919 --> 13:40.453
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.522
Where's Burt?
I wish I knew.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.257
He left before we woke up
this morning.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.993
He missed a really
good breakfast.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.162
We had ham and eggs, bacon,
pigs in a blanket,

13:49.196 --> 13:50.931
and the blanket was ham.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.565
Burt, I don't know where the
heck you went this morning,

13:52.599 --> 13:54.367
but we said we were gonna
do this as a family,

13:54.401 --> 13:55.969
and I expect you to be here.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.204
Oh, hey, pig-ahoy.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.509
Burt, you found another
Mr. Curly Tail?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.277
Like the Good Book
probably says,

14:04.311 --> 14:06.146
"Have a little faith,
then ye shall find-eth."

14:06.179 --> 14:08.648
There you are.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.918
We're just about
to make the presentation.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.552
Give me that pig.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.287
Come on, let's go.
Let's... going to work.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.323
Yep, yep, yep,
yep, yep.

14:17.925 --> 14:19.526
This is amazing.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.929
I would've thought there's a
waiting list for a service pig.

14:21.962 --> 14:22.795
I'm sure there is.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.397
But you can get
a regular pig like that.

14:24.431 --> 14:28.401
So you just got some
random animal off a farm?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.038
Petting zoo. For $100,
the guy said I could have

14:31.071 --> 14:33.406
any animal I wanted, and I could
do whatever I wanted with it.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.275
Then he winked at me.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.478
We are never taking Hope
to that petting zoo.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.681
SARAH LOUISE:
Just sweet, right?
(applause)

14:41.714 --> 14:43.650
Just sweet, oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

14:43.683 --> 14:44.952
I'm not done.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.219
I've also thought
to provide

14:46.253 --> 14:48.488
this pouch of treats
that you can use to reward

14:48.521 --> 14:51.691
your service companion as he
adapts to your personal needs.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.060
Let's put this on you.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.196
There you go.
Thank you.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.065
No, it's not about me,

14:58.098 --> 15:00.968
or the $47.00 that I spent
on the pouch and treats.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.570
This is about you.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.039
I'm smiling and pointing
at you, Carl.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.240
Okay.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.408
It's a good thing.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.043
What the hell, Burt?
He's gonna get killed

15:10.077 --> 15:12.412
being dragged around town
by an untrained pig.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.415
Don't worry,
I have a plan.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.451
*

15:18.485 --> 15:20.553
JIMMY:
Dad did have a plan.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.125
(grunting)

15:25.158 --> 15:28.962
But like most of his plans,
it was crazy.

15:28.996 --> 15:32.132
Dad figured that we could keep
Carl safe by being guide humans

15:32.165 --> 15:34.167
for the fake guide pig.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.536
Good job, pig.

15:38.338 --> 15:42.209
* Like I'm living again *

15:42.242 --> 15:44.111
* I'm so glad...

15:44.144 --> 15:47.614
Hey, you smell that, pig?
Someone must have passed by

15:47.647 --> 15:50.183
wearing cheap perfume
and way too much of it.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.487
It's lingering.

15:54.521 --> 15:57.324
JIMMY:
All we had to do was keep
the most popular blind man

15:57.357 --> 15:59.159
in town alive long enough

15:59.192 --> 16:00.994
for Dad to win
the Heaven's Helpers election.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.129
Good job, pig.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.466
*

16:06.499 --> 16:07.734
Ah!

16:07.767 --> 16:10.170
(chuckling)

16:10.203 --> 16:11.271
(sneezes)

16:11.304 --> 16:12.772
Bless you, pig.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.008
JIMMY:
And once Dad was in charge,

16:15.042 --> 16:17.110
he'd be able to figure out
a more permanent solution.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.578
(car horn honking)

16:20.447 --> 16:21.614
Oh, good job, pig.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.216
(snorting)

16:27.054 --> 16:29.156
*

16:29.189 --> 16:32.125
That was a close call, huh?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.093
(snorting)

16:33.126 --> 16:34.427
Yeah, it was.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.297
Boy, you saved my life, pig.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.531
JIMMY:
It was gonna be tough,

16:38.565 --> 16:41.268
but luckily, our family
is used to doing horrible jobs.

16:41.301 --> 16:42.169
Pig! Towel!

16:44.671 --> 16:48.375
* You're the one who erased
the pain *

16:48.408 --> 16:52.412
* My life will never be
the same *

16:52.445 --> 16:56.516
* You're the very one, the only
one that I've been waiting for *

16:56.549 --> 16:58.085
Pig! Bag!

16:58.118 --> 17:00.187
* I want to thank you...

17:00.220 --> 17:02.555
Good job, pig.

17:02.589 --> 17:04.391
(snorting)

17:06.826 --> 17:10.363
* I just want to say
thank you, baby *

17:10.397 --> 17:13.166
* For saving my life *

17:13.200 --> 17:16.203
* For picking me up *

17:16.236 --> 17:19.139
* Dusting me off

17:19.172 --> 17:22.642
* Putting me all back together,
together *
* Together, together *

17:22.675 --> 17:23.676
* Together

17:23.710 --> 17:25.178
(snorting)

17:25.212 --> 17:27.414
* I can live
* I can live *

17:27.447 --> 17:30.183
* Since I found you, baby...

17:30.217 --> 17:31.784
Thank you.

17:31.818 --> 17:36.423
What's... up, Natesville?!

17:36.456 --> 17:40.093
It's 58 degrees,
7:32 in the morning.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.528
Okay, pig, time to go.

17:44.597 --> 17:48.468
Hey, hey, we're running late,
pig, come on. We gotta...

17:48.501 --> 17:51.471
* For saving my life *
* We played together

17:51.504 --> 17:54.207
* For picking me up *
* I can't live

17:54.241 --> 17:56.643
* I can't live
without you, baby *
* For dusting me off *

17:56.676 --> 17:58.278
* Didn't you, didn't you,
didn't you, didn't you? *

17:59.846 --> 18:02.649
* Since I found you, baby

18:02.682 --> 18:04.317
* I can't live, I can't live *

18:04.351 --> 18:07.487
What are you doing,
Virginia?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.122
Uh, just getting
a closer look at this pig.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.223
Did you ever notice he has

18:10.257 --> 18:12.459
the exact same eyes
as David Lee Roth?

18:12.492 --> 18:14.327
Oh, good evening, ladies.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.429
Am I on time
for the meeting?

18:16.463 --> 18:18.097
Right on time. Come on in.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.404
Hello, everyone,
and welcome to

18:24.437 --> 18:27.140
a very important meeting of
Heaven's Helpers.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.808
Tonight we will be
choosing a chairperson

18:28.841 --> 18:32.179
to lead our group
for the next two years.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.413
Normally, the nominees

18:33.446 --> 18:35.815
would each give a short
speech before the vote.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.885
Since Burt will show you
that speeches are boring

18:38.918 --> 18:42.589
and since actions speak louder
than words, I want you to see

18:42.622 --> 18:44.491
with your own eyes
how my work

18:44.524 --> 18:46.259
did not just
give this man a pig.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.228
It gave him his freedom.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.397
I'm going to give you
a demonstration

18:50.430 --> 18:53.566
on the amazing things that
this pig is trained to do.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.703
We are so busted.

18:56.736 --> 18:59.172
I'm starting to think our plan
to impersonate a guide pig

18:59.206 --> 19:01.774
to fool a blind man
and a church congregation

19:01.808 --> 19:03.743
was slightly flawed.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.219
Prepare to be amazed.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.654
This is going to be like
the Easter fart times 20.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.189
This is going to be
even worse than

19:16.223 --> 19:17.857
Jimmy's Christmas
caroling boner.

19:17.890 --> 19:21.194
Now, Carl, I'm going to need
you to turn around.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.862
Wait. This could be great. I
mean, you guys aren't gonna get

19:22.895 --> 19:24.897
blamed when the pig
can't do it; she is.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.367
She's the one trying to take
all the credit. It's karma.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.270
Oh, yeah, like that show
with the Mallrats guy

19:30.303 --> 19:31.338
you kept trying
to make me like.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.541
Now, tell the pig
to get your bag.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.542
Pig, bag.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.814
(pig squeals)

19:41.848 --> 19:43.516
Yes.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.654
I don't believe it.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.721
Lucky break.

19:48.755 --> 19:49.922
Pig, home.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.362
Yes, right this way.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.930
Good. Yes.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.400
(pig squeals)

20:10.443 --> 20:12.479
What the hell's
going on here?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.381
I think we trained
that pig.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.349
Oh, my God.
We taught it how to be

20:16.383 --> 20:19.486
a guide pig by leading it around
and showing it what to do.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.521
And giving it pig treats
as positive reinforcement.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.256
You gave the treats
to the pig?

20:23.290 --> 20:24.824
Yeah. What'd you
do with them?

20:24.857 --> 20:27.360
(chuckles)
I gave them to the pig.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.995
(applause)

20:29.028 --> 20:30.997
VIRGINIA:
I can't believe this.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.865
She's getting
all the credit again.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.401
And we can't even
tell anybody what we did,

20:34.434 --> 20:36.503
or they'll know that we ate
Mr. Curly Tail.

20:36.536 --> 20:37.837
Now she's definitely gonna win.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.440
I don't know about that,
'cause I wrote Burt
a pretty great speech.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.275
It was basically
the speech from Braveheart,

20:42.309 --> 20:45.678
except at the end, it was like
"You can take our church bazaar,

20:45.712 --> 20:48.381
but you'll never take
our rummage sale."

20:48.415 --> 20:49.916
But like subtle.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.450
Burt?

20:50.483 --> 20:53.486
Burt, Burt, come on.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.821
You gotta focus
on your speech.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.923
Ah, I don't care.
She can be in charge.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.492
What? But then you'll
never get the credit.

20:59.526 --> 21:01.728
I don't need it.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.662
Look what we did.

21:02.695 --> 21:03.763
(bike bell rings)

21:05.965 --> 21:09.902
JIMMY:
Dad realized he didn't need to
be in charge to get some glory,

21:09.936 --> 21:11.838
because he didn't
need glory at all.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.006
Happiness is making
other people happy.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.810
And after that,
Dad was happy to do

21:17.844 --> 21:19.712
his volunteer work around
the church simply for the good

21:19.746 --> 21:21.581
feeling of knowing that he had
helped make things better.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.583
Looking good, Carl.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.353
Thanks, Burt, 'cause you know
I can't tell.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.921
(laughing)
Great hearing and funny.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.923
You're almost the total package.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.024
Nice.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.898
Dump is cool.
