WEBVTT

00:03.205 --> 00:05.123
Previously on Future Man...

00:05.207 --> 00:08.418
I'm gonna run this
through every DNA database

00:08.502 --> 00:09.795
in the world.

00:09.878 --> 00:13.257
Gonna run every name
that dealer gave us.

00:13.340 --> 00:16.468
Professor Karofsky,
I am, uh, Josh Pastman.

00:16.552 --> 00:18.095
There are people who want you dead.

00:19.263 --> 00:20.597
That's what's-her-name from Accounting.

00:20.681 --> 00:22.766
- I know these people.
- Biotics can be anybody.

00:22.849 --> 00:24.935
Every Biotic soldier
has a bomb implanted.

00:25.018 --> 00:27.437
It blows their head so
they can't be interrogated.

00:27.521 --> 00:29.606
- We need another time machine.
- Biotics have time machines.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.066
And we already know that
they're in the laboratory

00:31.149 --> 00:32.776
that you clean,
we just have to catch one.

00:32.859 --> 00:33.885
Okay.

00:34.778 --> 00:38.699
Separating Biotics from humans
is not going to be easy.

00:38.782 --> 00:40.200
I could go Call of Zion.

00:40.284 --> 00:43.036
It'd be messy but it could work.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.788
Can you get everyone
you work with in one room

00:44.871 --> 00:47.124
- that we could flood?
- No, I can't.

00:47.207 --> 00:50.085
Hm, can't or won't?

00:50.168 --> 00:51.878
Both.

00:51.962 --> 00:55.882
Guys, the whole point of this
was to get a Biotic alive

00:55.966 --> 00:58.176
and get it to tell us where its TTD is.

00:58.260 --> 00:59.845
Yeah, so we flush them out.

00:59.928 --> 01:01.638
Humans are weaker, so they die first.

01:01.722 --> 01:03.640
Biotics are left standing.

01:03.724 --> 01:04.933
We kill them all, except for one,

01:05.016 --> 01:08.103
deactivate its brain bomb,
then the torture starts.

01:08.186 --> 01:09.563
Isn't there something that we can do

01:09.646 --> 01:12.482
that's a little more
temporary, like, uh...

01:12.566 --> 01:17.112
like a light, non-lethal
dosage of poison or something?

01:17.195 --> 01:20.657
Well, Biotics, they
are immune to poison.

01:20.741 --> 01:22.409
We could gas the vents,
but I don't know,

01:22.492 --> 01:25.370
- it's too risky.
- Ingestibles are safer.

01:25.454 --> 01:27.664
This place is thick
with sewer mushrooms.

01:27.748 --> 01:29.082
Couple seconds after eating those,

01:29.166 --> 01:30.167
you puke, shit yourself,

01:30.250 --> 01:32.002
and pass out with no
memory of what happened.

01:32.085 --> 01:33.920
Learned that the hard way.

01:34.004 --> 01:35.213
- Twice.
- I don't know,

01:35.297 --> 01:36.548
too many variables,
they'd all have to be

01:36.632 --> 01:37.966
in the same room at the same time

01:38.050 --> 01:39.593
eating the same thing.

01:43.764 --> 01:46.391
Kronish Ball.

01:46.475 --> 01:47.684
Guys, the Kronish Ball.

01:47.768 --> 01:49.144
It's... it's our holiday party,

01:49.227 --> 01:50.854
it's coming up this weekend.

01:50.937 --> 01:52.022
Everyone gets dressed up.

01:52.105 --> 01:53.857
There's an open bar,
there's tons of food.

01:53.940 --> 01:55.192
And the best part?

01:55.275 --> 01:57.027
Kronish gives this big speech at the end

01:57.110 --> 01:59.488
and it finishes with everyone eating

01:59.571 --> 02:02.532
one of his Kronish balls.

02:02.616 --> 02:04.826
They're like little
chocolate truffle balls.

02:04.910 --> 02:06.203
That is stupid,

02:06.286 --> 02:07.954
even for the standards of this time.

02:08.038 --> 02:10.707
But the entire company has to be there.

02:10.791 --> 02:12.959
So any Biotics that are
hiding within the lab

02:13.043 --> 02:15.170
have to be there as well.

02:15.253 --> 02:17.381
If I can get the recipe
for the Kronish balls,

02:17.464 --> 02:19.299
do you think that we can
make a poisoned version

02:19.383 --> 02:21.051
and then just swap it in?

02:21.134 --> 02:22.969
- It's doable.
- Wolf, you're the poison guy.

02:23.053 --> 02:24.221
What do you know about cooking?

02:24.304 --> 02:25.889
Remove the hair, eat the meat.

02:25.972 --> 02:27.015
We can work with that.

02:27.099 --> 02:31.770
Tiger, you can go in
undercover as my date.

02:31.853 --> 02:34.272
It's like a companion.

02:34.356 --> 02:35.565
- Mate.
- Fine, yeah,

02:35.649 --> 02:37.859
I'll be your fucking date.

02:41.530 --> 02:43.490
We might need some help.

02:43.573 --> 02:45.450
I've got to even it out.

02:47.119 --> 02:51.142

02:54.418 --> 02:55.836
Yeah, so...

02:55.919 --> 02:57.921
Tiger and Corey are part of
that job-training program

02:58.004 --> 03:00.799
at work where we help the homeless.

03:00.882 --> 03:02.300
They really just want to contribute

03:02.384 --> 03:03.760
to the party and just try to fit in

03:03.844 --> 03:04.761
the best they can.

03:04.845 --> 03:06.346
And both were in Afghanistan?

03:06.430 --> 03:08.849
Yes, the Taliban messed
them up pretty good.

03:08.932 --> 03:10.684
So they say a lot of things
that are pretty crazy,

03:10.767 --> 03:12.144
just try to ignore it.

03:12.227 --> 03:14.271
- He's touching the...
- Yeah, just... you've got to,

03:14.354 --> 03:15.689
- got to ignore it.
- Well, don't worry, sweetie.

03:15.772 --> 03:16.982
Back in the '80s,

03:17.065 --> 03:19.359
when your dad and I spent
that summer in the jungle,

03:19.443 --> 03:21.778
we saw a woman breastfeed a piglet.

03:21.862 --> 03:22.779
- Wow.
- Mm-hm.

03:22.863 --> 03:24.322
If we can handle that,
we can handle these two.

03:24.406 --> 03:25.782
I can't thank you guys enough,

03:25.866 --> 03:28.743
- I really owe you.
- You never owe us anything.

03:28.827 --> 03:30.036
Ever.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.872
Ooh!

03:35.667 --> 03:38.795
I have that same shirt.

03:38.879 --> 03:40.547
And pants.

03:42.000 --> 03:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:19.418 --> 04:23.465
- Hey, Dr. Kronish.
- Well, if it isn't my savior.

04:23.548 --> 04:25.008
You know, it turns out
you were quite prophetic

04:25.091 --> 04:26.593
about those animal rights activists.

04:26.676 --> 04:29.262
Your methods were unorthodox but...

04:29.346 --> 04:31.640
appreciated.

04:31.723 --> 04:33.225
Yeah, uh, no problem.

04:33.308 --> 04:34.351
Hey, I just want to tell you,

04:34.434 --> 04:36.269
I'm really excited
for the upcoming party

04:36.353 --> 04:38.355
and I cannot wait
for those Kronish balls.

04:38.438 --> 04:40.524
Well, you'll have to roll
that excitement back.

04:40.607 --> 04:42.108
The balls have been bounced.

04:42.192 --> 04:43.735
- What?
- They're off the menu.

04:43.819 --> 04:45.946
Dr. Camillo scaled the whole party down

04:46.029 --> 04:47.531
after I gave away our research

04:47.614 --> 04:50.367
and cost the company billions.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.035
But the Dr. Kronish that I know

04:52.118 --> 04:54.162
would never let somebody
push them around like this.

04:54.246 --> 04:56.331
I don't know what Dr. Kronish
you're referring to.

04:56.414 --> 04:58.792
I'm just the face and lips
of this organization.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.044
Stu is the business brains.

05:01.127 --> 05:03.547
He's been on me for years
about the party anyway.

05:03.630 --> 05:05.924
He thinks the whole idea of
toasting with chocolate balls

05:06.007 --> 05:07.801
is silly... and it is.

05:07.884 --> 05:11.388
I mean, we're not Blapple,
known for fun and whimsy.

05:11.471 --> 05:13.849
We're curing STDs here.

05:13.932 --> 05:17.185
We should act like it, for God's sake.

05:17.269 --> 05:20.188
Don't forget to bring cash for the bar.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.275
Okay.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.572
Now, this ganache truffle

05:28.655 --> 05:30.365
that you want to make for the party,

05:30.448 --> 05:32.325
that, my friend, is
a bit of a tricky dish,

05:32.409 --> 05:34.244
even for a skilled chef like myself.

05:34.327 --> 05:36.580
So since we don't even
have the recipe yet,

05:36.663 --> 05:38.790
let's walk before we run.

05:38.874 --> 05:40.208
The omelet.

05:40.292 --> 05:41.835
Every chef must master it.

05:41.918 --> 05:45.046
So, get in there and beat those eggs.

05:58.184 --> 05:59.895
Die, egg scum!

05:59.978 --> 06:01.313
Egg smash!

06:03.189 --> 06:06.902
Your shell is weak!

06:10.030 --> 06:14.451
I meant, beat the eggs
in a bowl, with this.

06:14.534 --> 06:15.911
Hm.

06:20.874 --> 06:23.960
The antidote for failure is punishment.

06:26.171 --> 06:27.505
Son...

06:27.589 --> 06:30.133
I don't know how things
work out in the street,

06:30.216 --> 06:31.468
but in my kitchen,

06:31.551 --> 06:33.595
the only punishment for failure...

06:34.638 --> 06:36.806
...is a hug.

06:43.563 --> 06:45.815
Mm-hm.

06:45.899 --> 06:46.900
Hm.

06:48.610 --> 06:49.653
Hey!

06:49.736 --> 06:51.488
Josh! You're still here.

06:51.571 --> 06:53.490
- Why wouldn't I be?
- I thought you might have quit.

06:53.573 --> 06:55.825
A bunch of people left
and didn't even give notice.

06:55.909 --> 06:57.035
- Carl...
- Carl?

06:57.118 --> 06:59.329
- Wow, Carl's gone?
- Janis.

06:59.412 --> 07:01.331
- Janis?
- From Accounting.

07:01.414 --> 07:03.833
The girl with the pretty smile?

07:05.001 --> 07:06.961
Oh yeah, no, I don't
think I ever met her.

07:07.045 --> 07:08.004
You also missed a full day

07:08.088 --> 07:09.923
of Dr. Camillo yelling at Dr. Kronish

07:10.006 --> 07:11.257
in front of everyone.

07:11.341 --> 07:13.426
What were you thinking, Elias?

07:13.510 --> 07:15.595
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!

07:15.679 --> 07:17.472
Dr. Kronish does not deserve that.

07:17.555 --> 07:21.976
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid man!

07:22.060 --> 07:22.894
Hey.

07:22.977 --> 07:27.023
Um, maybe we could try to cheer him up.

07:27.107 --> 07:29.109
Do you think you can give me the recipe

07:29.192 --> 07:30.235
for the Kronish balls?

07:30.318 --> 07:32.237
I'm not sure where
you're going with this.

07:32.320 --> 07:34.447
Well, they just took them
off the menu for the party,

07:34.531 --> 07:35.699
and I don't know,

07:35.782 --> 07:37.033
thought I could just,
like, surprise him,

07:37.117 --> 07:38.118
cheer him up.

07:38.201 --> 07:40.036
Oh, that's really thoughtful for a dude.

07:40.120 --> 07:43.206
You are a real Renaissance janitor.

07:43.289 --> 07:46.209
Feel like you could have said
"man" there, but I'll take it.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.919
I'll see what I can do about the recipe.

07:48.002 --> 07:49.087
Thank you.

07:49.170 --> 07:51.881
I'll email it to you tomorrow, man.

07:51.965 --> 07:52.966
Girl.

07:53.049 --> 07:54.384
Woman.

07:54.467 --> 07:56.302
Woman.

07:56.386 --> 07:57.637
Thanks.

08:01.266 --> 08:02.142
Mm.

08:02.225 --> 08:03.935
Now that the sauce is properly reduced,

08:04.018 --> 08:05.687
correct with salt.

08:09.983 --> 08:13.737
Let's just not waste any more gas here.

08:13.820 --> 08:16.781
Corey, if you add too much
or not enough of something,

08:16.865 --> 08:18.742
you won't get the flavor you want.

08:18.825 --> 08:20.744
So, too much salt?

08:20.827 --> 08:22.620
Cooking is about precision.

08:22.704 --> 08:24.914
A precise quantity cooked
at a precise temperature

08:24.998 --> 08:27.417
for a precise time equals
a chemical reaction.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.462
A whole new profile
of flavors is unleashed!

08:30.545 --> 08:33.173
Temperature creates a chemical reaction.

08:33.256 --> 08:34.256
Yes.

08:34.340 --> 08:37.092
Like making an arctic pulse ray.

08:37.177 --> 08:39.511
It uses supercharged Freon
to freeze your blood,

08:39.596 --> 08:40.804
killing you instantly.

08:40.889 --> 08:45.435
Cooking is... like making one of those.

08:45.518 --> 08:47.645
What did they do to you over there?

08:59.783 --> 09:04.162
Lawsuits... lawsuits pending.

09:04.245 --> 09:05.497
Ah ha!

09:07.999 --> 09:09.959
Bingo.

09:10.043 --> 09:12.337
Okay.

09:12.420 --> 09:15.215
Let's see.

09:15.298 --> 09:17.133
Okay, Janis.

09:17.217 --> 09:20.178
Let's see where the dots connect

09:20.261 --> 09:24.015
so I can smoke out the
rest of your Biotic powers.

09:24.099 --> 09:27.352
Show me all your secrets.

09:27.435 --> 09:29.104
What are you doing?

09:29.187 --> 09:30.647
- Oh, uh...
- Why are you going

09:30.730 --> 09:33.066
through people's files?

09:33.149 --> 09:34.859
Oh, those, yeah... I, uh,

09:34.943 --> 09:37.862
you know, I... I didn't get
a chance to say goodbye

09:37.946 --> 09:39.697
to Carl and Janis before they left,

09:39.781 --> 09:41.449
so I wanted to find their addresses

09:41.533 --> 09:43.118
and send them a little goodbye card.

09:43.201 --> 09:45.078
You didn't even know
Janis's name this morning.

09:45.161 --> 09:46.704
Well, I knew her trash.

09:46.788 --> 09:47.997
To you, she's Janis;

09:48.081 --> 09:51.292
to me, she's yogurt cup,
banana peel, pretty smile girl.

09:51.376 --> 09:53.169
You shouldn't be going
through these people's files.

09:53.253 --> 09:56.840
It's like a serious invasion of privacy.

09:56.923 --> 09:58.466
Oh.

09:58.550 --> 10:00.009
I...

10:00.093 --> 10:01.344
Wow.

10:01.427 --> 10:05.348
Dr. Camillo's emergency
contact number is just 9-1-1.

10:05.431 --> 10:06.766
Oh no.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.476
Nobody loves that guy.

10:08.560 --> 10:09.894
He yelled away everybody in his life

10:09.978 --> 10:11.646
that could ever love him.

10:11.729 --> 10:14.357
"Joshua Sasha Futterman"?

10:14.440 --> 10:15.525
It's my grandmother's name,

10:15.608 --> 10:16.943
it's sentimental, please give me...

10:17.026 --> 10:20.697
Joshua Sasha Futterman,
Joshua Sasha Futterman.

10:22.157 --> 10:23.533
I know, if we can't
read those kind of...

10:23.616 --> 10:25.034
Hey, back off, buddy,

10:25.118 --> 10:26.911
or else I'm going to rub
some tree nuts on you

10:26.995 --> 10:29.747
so you get "golf ball
size hives and welts."

10:29.831 --> 10:31.166
Okay, you know what, let's see what

10:31.249 --> 10:32.876
you're allergic to.

10:32.959 --> 10:34.711
Uh-oh, do not.

10:34.794 --> 10:38.631
Nope, Miss Geri Elizabeth Lange.

10:38.715 --> 10:40.842
That's not that... that's
not that weird, I guess.

10:40.925 --> 10:44.262
Medical conditions.

10:44.345 --> 10:46.264
None.

10:46.347 --> 10:47.849
Allergies.

10:49.684 --> 10:52.687
- None. Damn it!
- Are you having fun?

10:52.770 --> 10:55.023
All right, how about another sriracheeto

10:55.106 --> 10:56.983
while we're at it?

10:57.066 --> 10:59.736
- No thank you.
- No?

10:59.819 --> 11:01.905
- What do you mean, no?
- I'm good, that is gross.

11:01.988 --> 11:05.450
No, a secret family recipe.

11:05.533 --> 11:07.619
Mm, real good.

11:07.702 --> 11:09.704
I should... I should probably get going.

11:09.787 --> 11:10.914
Mm.

11:10.997 --> 11:12.165
Yeah, me too, I got to

11:12.248 --> 11:14.500
clean these up and everything.

11:14.584 --> 11:17.795
♪ Vultures circle ♪

11:17.879 --> 11:19.088
♪ And you are the friend ♪

11:19.172 --> 11:20.715
- We could do one more.
- One more?

11:20.798 --> 11:21.758
- We're here.
- We could.

11:21.841 --> 11:22.967
We're in it.

11:23.051 --> 11:25.094
Let's do it, We could do one more.

11:32.936 --> 11:34.354
Hey, hey, hey.

11:34.437 --> 11:35.438
I got something for you.

11:35.521 --> 11:36.689
What did you do?

11:36.773 --> 11:38.900
These are noise cancelling
headphones, and look.

11:38.983 --> 11:41.110
I put Stu blockers
on them, so you don't...

11:41.194 --> 11:42.612
The police are here.

11:42.695 --> 11:43.780
What?

11:43.863 --> 11:46.807
They're looking for a Josh "Pastman."

11:46.849 --> 11:47.866
Oh, fuck.

11:49.826 --> 11:53.163
Why would you choose
such a stupid cover name?

11:53.247 --> 11:54.373
Fuck!

11:59.788 --> 12:02.233
You gotta be able to find me
an employee directory.

12:02.234 --> 12:03.254
We don't have any actually.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.701
I think I can find you one, though.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.221
Okay, I have to get the
fuck out of here right now.

12:09.304 --> 12:10.973
Why is a cop looking for you?

12:11.056 --> 12:13.558
It's complicated, okay?

12:13.642 --> 12:15.143
Would you please
tell me what's going on?

12:15.227 --> 12:20.107
- I can't explain it right now.
- Josh, Josh, level with me.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.818
Look, okay, I'm mixed
up in some things that

12:22.901 --> 12:26.613
the cops just can't
understand right now, okay?

12:26.697 --> 12:29.866
But I swear to you, I did nothing wrong.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.495
Can you please help me get out of here?

12:37.040 --> 12:39.334
You better be the fun kind of fugitive.

12:45.841 --> 12:46.675
Hey.

12:46.758 --> 12:48.385
Can I talk to you for a second?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.053
I've got it this, thanks.

12:52.431 --> 12:54.224
How can I help you,
Detective Skaarsgard?

12:54.308 --> 12:56.351
Earlier, you failed to mention

12:56.435 --> 12:59.062
that a Josh Futterman works here.

12:59.146 --> 13:02.733
You asked about a Josh Pastman.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.027
Oh, yeah, now I see it.

13:05.110 --> 13:08.030
Two days ago, there was
a shootout at a meth lab

13:08.113 --> 13:09.865
down on Seventh.

13:09.948 --> 13:13.117
Five wounded, critically.

13:13.118 --> 13:14.129
Whoa.

13:16.288 --> 13:17.205
Hm.

13:18.665 --> 13:23.295
Man I'm looking for might
have something to do with it.

13:23.378 --> 13:26.715
He, uh, might also have something to do

13:26.798 --> 13:31.345
with a cop killing in 1969.

13:31.428 --> 13:33.263
That cop?

13:33.347 --> 13:38.060
My partner, Jorge Santiago.

13:38.143 --> 13:42.147
He left a widow,
belly swollen with child.

13:44.566 --> 13:48.195
The fuck do you people do here?

13:48.278 --> 13:50.363
Science.

13:52.491 --> 13:54.826
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:54.910 --> 13:58.288
I'm going to ask you again.

13:58.371 --> 14:02.417
Where is Josh Futterman?

14:02.501 --> 14:04.211
I don't know.

14:04.294 --> 14:05.962
But I can tell you this:

14:06.046 --> 14:07.130
Josh couldn't be involved

14:07.214 --> 14:09.091
'cause he wasn't alive in the '60s.

14:09.174 --> 14:12.427
And he's kind of dopey
and charming, you know, like...

14:12.511 --> 14:13.678
but harmless.

14:13.762 --> 14:16.098
Like, not in an unattractive way.

14:16.181 --> 14:19.518
I used to know a guy a lot like that.

14:19.601 --> 14:22.854
My partner, Jorge Santiago.

14:25.357 --> 14:28.610
Tell your lover boy to give me a call.

14:37.619 --> 14:39.830
Oof!

14:50.841 --> 14:53.468
There was a towel bin?

15:01.601 --> 15:06.940
How is something so stupid so hard?

15:07.023 --> 15:08.942
Weight on your toe, not on your heel.

15:09.025 --> 15:11.611
And whatever you do, don't look down.

15:11.695 --> 15:13.321
I don't know why you
would wear something

15:13.405 --> 15:15.407
if they compromise your ability to move.

15:15.490 --> 15:18.326
Well, they tighten your tushie.

15:18.410 --> 15:21.663
- What?
- Your butt.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.207
Everything you've been
telling me these past two days?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.042
Paint my face, wear colorful garb,

15:26.126 --> 15:29.254
put on those tiny fucking stilts?

15:29.337 --> 15:32.799
You've reduced me to nothing
more than a sewer clown.

15:32.883 --> 15:34.801
But look, Tiger.

15:34.885 --> 15:37.012
When I wear something like this,

15:37.095 --> 15:38.763
I feel beautiful,

15:38.847 --> 15:40.640
and confident and comfortable.

15:40.724 --> 15:41.850
I like the way I look,

15:41.933 --> 15:44.102
and I actually do it for myself.

15:44.186 --> 15:47.856
I mean, you know, sure,
Gabe appreciates it.

15:47.939 --> 15:49.858
He calls it "the sex dress."

15:49.941 --> 15:53.695
Actually, this is the best
way that I have found so far

15:53.778 --> 15:57.032
to get him away from
those whale documentaries.

15:57.115 --> 15:58.867
Why, why is it so distracting?

15:58.950 --> 16:00.493
Well, because he's a man,

16:00.577 --> 16:03.705
and, I mean, you know how men are.

16:03.788 --> 16:06.208
They think with their dicks.

16:06.291 --> 16:09.211
You know? I mean, not... not all men.

16:09.294 --> 16:14.299
But, uh... no, yeah, it is all men.

16:14.382 --> 16:18.970
So this dress can be
used to mind-control men?

16:19.054 --> 16:20.222
Yeah, and some women.

16:20.305 --> 16:21.598
But that's besides the point.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.725
Look, if you don't feel
comfortable in those,

16:23.808 --> 16:25.268
then who cares what anyone thinks?

16:25.352 --> 16:26.728
Why are you being so nice to me?

16:26.811 --> 16:28.855
What is your fucking endgame, Diane?

16:28.939 --> 16:31.149
No, there is no endgame, Tiger.

16:31.233 --> 16:32.901
It's 'cause if someone or something

16:32.984 --> 16:35.403
is important to Joshie,
it's important to me.

16:35.487 --> 16:36.905
He is family.

16:36.988 --> 16:38.448
Yeah, well, I never had a family.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.116
I mean, I had a ward
leader, but he was killed

16:40.200 --> 16:41.868
trying to steal a sugar cube.

16:41.952 --> 16:43.495
I'm so sorry.

16:43.578 --> 16:46.373
It was my sugar cube.

16:46.456 --> 16:49.709
Well, you have got family
all around you here

16:49.793 --> 16:52.754
and I am not going
to let you fail, okay?

16:52.837 --> 16:54.047
I mean, look.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.716
If Joshie can learn to walk in heels,

16:56.800 --> 17:00.095
so can you.

17:00.178 --> 17:01.680
Come on.

17:01.763 --> 17:03.306
Yes!

17:03.390 --> 17:05.558
My God, what have you done?

17:05.642 --> 17:07.685
This is a symphony,
each note is perfect.

17:07.769 --> 17:09.271
What is that, cardamom?

17:09.354 --> 17:10.521
Just a dusting, master.

17:10.605 --> 17:12.398
No, no, no, look at this reflection.

17:12.482 --> 17:13.733
There's the master.

17:13.817 --> 17:15.859
You have speed, skills,
but more than that,

17:15.944 --> 17:17.487
it's like you have something to say.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.406
My mouth is all ears.

17:19.489 --> 17:21.825
I like cooking.

17:21.907 --> 17:24.536
I've never seen someone
come so far so fast.

17:24.618 --> 17:26.579
You were meant for this.

17:26.663 --> 17:28.080
I've always been a soldier.

17:28.164 --> 17:29.457
Life made you a soldier.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.293
You were born to be a chef.

17:31.376 --> 17:33.962
- Maybe in another life.
- No, in this life!

17:34.045 --> 17:38.174
You don't have to go back,
they don't own you.

17:38.258 --> 17:41.011
Do they? I'm not sure how
the Army works these days.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.598
This was a beautiful dream,

17:44.681 --> 17:46.850
but I don't give orders, I take them.

17:46.933 --> 17:51.104
As soon as I have that recipe
and the mission is complete,

17:51.187 --> 17:52.856
it's over.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.566
As long as we're still dreaming,

17:54.649 --> 17:57.110
how would you like
to learn to make a soufflé?

18:03.825 --> 18:05.410
Sweet or savory?

18:13.501 --> 18:15.295
Guys, guys, we're going to be late.

18:15.378 --> 18:16.880
These balls are going to kill.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.299
No, but they are going to
make people shit themselves.

18:19.382 --> 18:21.593
Yeah, with delight!

18:21.676 --> 18:24.346
Okay, okay, great.

18:24.429 --> 18:26.848
Hey, hey, guys, we...
they're loading up the car,

18:26.931 --> 18:28.975
we should probably get going.

18:33.938 --> 18:36.024
Mom, what did you do to your hair?

18:36.107 --> 18:39.694
I just gave it a little Tiger stripe.

18:39.778 --> 18:42.113
Great.

18:44.532 --> 18:48.995
- Whoa.
- Oh, isn't she beautiful?

18:49.079 --> 18:50.455
Yeah, shockingly so.

19:02.384 --> 19:05.261
Remember, anyone who
doesn't puke is a Biotic,

19:05.345 --> 19:06.763
so when the fighting starts,

19:06.846 --> 19:08.223
you're going to need to take cover.

19:08.306 --> 19:09.724
It's hard enough to kill a perf,

19:09.808 --> 19:11.851
- let alone take one alive.
- Okay.

19:22.821 --> 19:24.406
There's Kronish, so play it cool.

19:24.489 --> 19:26.282
Your mother also trained me
in the art of small talk,

19:26.366 --> 19:27.909
- so I got it.
- Okay.

19:27.992 --> 19:29.577
- Oh, Futterman!
- Dr. Kronish!

19:29.661 --> 19:33.248
- This party's really something.
- It's a fucking joke.

19:33.331 --> 19:35.208
Please, Marigold, not now.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.127
Give me a drink ticket.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.087
You finished your allotment already?

19:41.589 --> 19:42.757
Take mine.

19:42.841 --> 19:46.636
Uh, Dr. Kronish, this is my date.

19:46.720 --> 19:50.014
- Hello.
- Tyra Gerheart.

19:50.098 --> 19:51.641
Wow, what a party.

19:51.725 --> 19:54.269
You look like you've lost
a massive amount of weight.

19:54.352 --> 19:56.104
If that shake were any heartier,

19:56.187 --> 19:57.564
I'd have to call it a maul.

19:59.524 --> 20:02.110
I'll be at the bar.

20:02.193 --> 20:04.279
Well, the wife is displeased

20:04.362 --> 20:06.740
with my gift to the
scientific community.

20:06.823 --> 20:10.034
I'll be paying for
that one for, oh, ever.

20:10.118 --> 20:12.620
Okay, well I do have a little something
to help cheer you up.

20:12.704 --> 20:14.080
It's not a billion dollars,

20:14.164 --> 20:16.040
however, I thought that it wouldn't feel

20:16.124 --> 20:21.921
like the Kronish Ball
without... a Kronish ball!

20:22.005 --> 20:23.715
Futterman!

20:23.798 --> 20:25.300
I'm touched.

20:25.383 --> 20:26.718
You can't eat that.

20:26.801 --> 20:28.678
- Can't eat that right now.
- Why not?

20:33.008 --> 20:34.142
What the...?

20:34.225 --> 20:36.144
Here... don't!

20:36.227 --> 20:37.854
If you follow me,
I have a surprise for you

20:37.937 --> 20:39.189
and I can explain everything.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.815
Who is this?

20:42.233 --> 20:44.319
Oh, I haven't seen
a confectioner's dusting

20:44.402 --> 20:46.613
like this since my last trip to Belgium!

20:47.906 --> 20:49.115
All right, you got the balls,

20:49.199 --> 20:52.035
what do you say you give the toast?

20:52.118 --> 20:54.412
It's a nice gesture, Futterman.

20:54.496 --> 20:56.331
But Stu's on the warpath.

20:56.414 --> 20:57.248
A toast with these

20:57.332 --> 21:00.460
would be an outright declaration of war.

21:00.543 --> 21:03.087
Oh, what do we have here?

21:03.171 --> 21:05.089
You guys brainstorming new ways

21:05.173 --> 21:07.842
to set piles of money on fire?

21:07.926 --> 21:10.887
Oh, hell no.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.847
You have got a lot of nerve, Elias.

21:12.931 --> 21:14.015
No, no, no, it was me.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.350
It was my idea to bring them.

21:15.433 --> 21:17.477
Even more nerve!

21:19.395 --> 21:22.148
That's for my yacht.

21:22.232 --> 21:24.150
That's for the helicopter
that was going to land

21:24.234 --> 21:25.568
on my yacht!

21:25.652 --> 21:28.655
This is for my seat at SpaceX!

21:28.738 --> 21:30.865
- First wife!
- Okay, okay, okay!

21:30.949 --> 21:35.244
Second wife! Mistress, mistress! Jetpack!

21:35.328 --> 21:37.080
G5, G7!

21:40.458 --> 21:43.545
Michael Jackson's catalogue!
Bobby's pre-school!

21:43.628 --> 21:45.505
Kids' therapy!

21:45.588 --> 21:48.800
Psycho's routine. Album.

21:52.178 --> 21:56.224
Well, Dr. Camillo.

21:56.307 --> 21:58.685
Fortunately, I have two balls left,

21:58.768 --> 22:00.645
which I intend to use right now.

22:00.728 --> 22:01.896
Last time I checked,

22:01.980 --> 22:04.566
you had 49 percent of the company.

22:04.649 --> 22:05.942
You're fired!

22:06.025 --> 22:07.235
You wouldn't dare!

22:07.318 --> 22:08.945
Now, if you'll excuse me,

22:09.028 --> 22:11.531
- I have a toast to give.
- No you don't!

22:11.614 --> 22:13.116
You need me, Elias!

22:13.199 --> 22:14.868
You are nothing without me!

22:14.951 --> 22:16.494
I can get you more balls, Dr. Kronish!

22:16.578 --> 22:18.454
It's not about the balls, son.

22:18.538 --> 22:21.374
Yes it is, it's all about the balls!

22:28.214 --> 22:31.134
What kind of monster would do this?

22:31.217 --> 22:33.678
Fuck this, back to Plan A,
Operation Gas Chamber.

22:33.761 --> 22:35.597
Oh, no, no, no, no; guys,
the toast is still on.

22:35.680 --> 22:36.973
This plan's going to work, all right?

22:37.056 --> 22:39.058
Wolf, I need you to make
150 more of these balls

22:39.142 --> 22:41.102
right now before Kronish gets up there.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.271
You talking about a Quickfire challenge?

22:43.354 --> 22:45.356
The quickest.

22:45.440 --> 22:48.693
Okay, and Tiger?

22:48.776 --> 22:51.321
- I need you to take someone out.
- Done.

22:54.490 --> 22:56.159
Stop what you're doing!

22:56.242 --> 22:58.202
We're making 150 ganache truffles

22:58.286 --> 22:59.579
in the next 10 minutes.

22:59.662 --> 23:01.748
Those aren't even on the menu, dude.

23:05.543 --> 23:10.214
I know some... no, all of you
don't want to be here tonight.

23:10.298 --> 23:11.215
No shit.

23:11.299 --> 23:12.717
You should.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.011
Cooking is a privilege.

23:15.094 --> 23:18.640
Tonight, I want you to
remember your first chop.

23:20.183 --> 23:22.393
Your first reduction.

23:22.477 --> 23:26.439
Tonight, I want you to be heroes...

23:26.522 --> 23:28.524
nay, gods.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.736
Better than gods, chefs!

23:31.819 --> 23:33.655
So bring me your butter,

23:33.738 --> 23:36.032
bring me your Valrhona chocolate,

23:36.115 --> 23:38.826
and bring me your...

23:41.162 --> 23:43.665
...heavy cream.

23:43.748 --> 23:47.710
Fuck you, Elias, fuck you, Elias.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.296
I'm the king of the microphones!

23:50.380 --> 23:53.841
Okay, so that drunk ass
over there is Stu Camillo.

23:53.925 --> 23:56.844
Can't make a speech
without one of these babies!

23:56.928 --> 23:58.577
I need you to neutralize him.

23:58.602 --> 23:59.656
Copy that.

23:59.681 --> 24:02.308
Commencing Operation Whale Documentary.

24:02.392 --> 24:04.727
- Fuck you!
- What?

24:06.253 --> 24:08.564
Somebody is using this shit
and it's not me.

24:13.778 --> 24:14.946
Hey.

24:18.491 --> 24:21.869
Can I, uh, buy you a drink?

24:26.666 --> 24:28.084
Geri.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.544
Geri.

24:29.627 --> 24:30.837
Geri!

24:37.927 --> 24:38.886
Your girlfriend's

24:38.970 --> 24:40.096
very beautiful.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.055
Girlfriend?

24:41.139 --> 24:42.390
No, no, no, it's nothing like that,

24:42.473 --> 24:44.142
she's not my girlfriend,
okay, she's someone

24:44.225 --> 24:45.435
that I work with, okay?

24:45.518 --> 24:47.729
It's more like a
partnership than anything.

24:47.812 --> 24:49.188
There's nothing romantic at all.

24:49.272 --> 24:51.733
Dude, I just saw you holding her hand.

24:51.816 --> 24:54.861
Yeah, but that's not what it looks like.

24:54.944 --> 24:56.404
Okay, that woman in there?

24:56.487 --> 24:57.405
She's used me.

24:57.488 --> 24:59.574
She's endangered my life
and to be honest,

24:59.657 --> 25:01.576
I don't even think she
likes me as a person.

25:01.659 --> 25:03.202
With any luck, she's
going to be gone soon.

25:03.286 --> 25:05.288
Like, really really far away forever.

25:05.371 --> 25:06.539
Josh, I don't really know you

25:06.622 --> 25:08.750
and you definitely don't know me, so...

25:08.833 --> 25:12.045
just let's not, okay?

25:28.186 --> 25:29.562
Divine.

25:29.645 --> 25:32.648
You know this needs to chill
for five hours, right?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.567
Leave that to me, Damian.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.830
Don't stop stirring!

25:47.914 --> 25:50.083
I want a texture of pure velvet!

25:59.383 --> 26:02.220
Lurking outside of a
bathroom is not a good look.

26:02.303 --> 26:04.722
Wait, I do know you.

26:04.806 --> 26:06.849
Okay, look, I know that you always cut

26:06.933 --> 26:08.684
the plastic soda rings that you have

26:08.768 --> 26:10.394
so that way, the fish don't choke.

26:10.478 --> 26:11.604
Which is so thoughtful.

26:11.687 --> 26:13.272
And I also know that
you're really funny,

26:13.356 --> 26:14.899
because you always make those doodles

26:14.982 --> 26:16.818
of possums probing scientists.

26:16.901 --> 26:19.320
Are you looking through my trash?

26:19.403 --> 26:20.822
Yes.

26:20.905 --> 26:22.156
No.

26:22.240 --> 26:23.241
Sort of.

26:23.324 --> 26:24.784
But I've learned things.

26:24.867 --> 26:27.245
Like, you're really caring.

26:27.328 --> 26:30.081
You know, like, you write
thank-you notes by hand.

26:30.164 --> 26:31.582
No one does that.

26:31.666 --> 26:34.502
And you're super, super creative.

26:34.585 --> 26:38.005
You take the most boring
everyday sandwich wrapper

26:38.089 --> 26:41.676
and you make it into
an origami masterpiece.

26:41.759 --> 26:43.094
I keep all of them.

26:43.177 --> 26:44.971
Like the crane, the dragon boat.

26:45.054 --> 26:46.848
I'm going to go ahead and stop you.

26:46.931 --> 26:50.560
You're walking a razor's edge
between creepy and romantic.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.606
Which... which way am I leaning?

27:04.574 --> 27:06.492
Stop looking through my trash.

27:06.576 --> 27:07.535
- Deal.
- Okay.

27:07.618 --> 27:09.162
Yeah.

27:13.910 --> 27:16.371
Can I get everyone's attention please?

27:16.420 --> 27:17.503
Oh my God.

27:17.528 --> 27:18.725
I can't miss that toast.

27:18.750 --> 27:20.464
- I can't miss that toast!
- Let's give it up for Dr. Kronish.

27:20.548 --> 27:21.716
You can't miss the toast?

27:21.799 --> 27:22.758
No, I can't!

27:22.842 --> 27:24.719
Uh, I'm sorry, I have to...

27:24.802 --> 27:25.803
I've got to go.

27:25.887 --> 27:27.471
I'll talk to you later!

27:29.390 --> 27:33.561
Uh, I didn't think I'd be
making this speech tonight.

27:33.644 --> 27:34.896
You shouldn't!

27:34.979 --> 27:37.356
Ladies and gentlemen,
my... my wife, Marigold.

27:40.151 --> 27:42.403
The sun is not setting on Kronish Labs.

27:42.486 --> 27:43.446
Where are the balls?

27:43.529 --> 27:45.323
There's still work to be done.

27:45.406 --> 27:47.575
The people who milked possums yesterday

27:47.658 --> 27:50.953
will be milking possums tomorrow.

27:51.037 --> 27:54.957
You're a hard man
to find, Mr. Futterman.

27:55.041 --> 27:59.545
Or should I call you Mr. Pastman, hm?

28:04.759 --> 28:07.345
If this arctic pulse ray doesn't work,

28:07.428 --> 28:10.097
we're all going to die.

28:15.811 --> 28:17.229
Shut up.

28:17.313 --> 28:18.821
You desire me.

28:18.948 --> 28:20.024
Yeah.

28:20.107 --> 28:22.068
And your desire for me makes you weak.

28:23.527 --> 28:24.779
So weak.

28:24.862 --> 28:26.113
The real value of this company

28:26.197 --> 28:27.865
is not in its stock price

28:27.949 --> 28:30.409
but in its employees.

28:30.493 --> 28:33.037
And I've been inspired
by someone who has courage

28:33.120 --> 28:34.246
and speaks the truth

28:34.330 --> 28:36.040
and is as kind and thoughtful

28:36.123 --> 28:37.959
as anyone that I've ever met.

28:38.042 --> 28:40.711
I didn't shoot any fucking meth dealers!

28:40.795 --> 28:42.213
All right, I'm 23 years old.

28:42.296 --> 28:43.881
How could I have possibly
killed your partner

28:43.965 --> 28:46.133
the night of the moon landing?

28:46.217 --> 28:50.012
I never said "night
of the moon landing."

28:50.096 --> 28:53.432
I want you to lick
every drop of chocolate

28:53.516 --> 28:56.352
off your hands while I watch.

29:02.066 --> 29:04.235
So let us one and all

29:04.318 --> 29:06.153
raise a ball.

29:06.237 --> 29:12.410
Next year, Kronish Labs
will go down in herpstory!

29:12.493 --> 29:14.495
And...

29:17.327 --> 29:19.582
Rich and velvety
with light notes of caramel.

29:19.583 --> 29:23.045
Mm, yes, isn't that good?

29:23.129 --> 29:27.841
Delicious! Ugh. You dog on tasty balls!

29:27.842 --> 29:29.552
Merry Christmas to all!

29:34.348 --> 29:36.434
All right.

29:36.517 --> 29:40.104
What do you want me to lick next?

29:41.814 --> 29:43.649
Uh-oh.

29:45.192 --> 29:46.986
- You're going to need this.
- Hey, my coat!

29:54.744 --> 29:56.412
So good.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.582
I earned it.

29:59.665 --> 30:01.751
Mm, damn.

30:01.834 --> 30:05.880
Vengeance isn't the only
thing that tastes sweet.

30:10.885 --> 30:14.889
Oh, vengeance isn't sitting so well.

30:16.515 --> 30:18.893
Uh, Detective, I'm really
sorry about all this,

30:18.976 --> 30:20.686
and I'm sorry about your partner

30:20.770 --> 30:22.605
and his pregnant wife!

30:22.688 --> 30:26.776
Belly swollen with child!

30:41.082 --> 30:43.709
I'm Icarus!

30:43.793 --> 30:47.254
Kenneth, from Payroll!

30:47.338 --> 30:49.673
Jim and Donna, from HR?

30:54.970 --> 30:56.889
Striking cane block!

31:02.353 --> 31:03.813
Crystal amber shield!

31:08.192 --> 31:09.944
Brain freeze!

31:11.654 --> 31:14.615
Clear!

31:28.671 --> 31:30.214
Cunt punt!

31:33.592 --> 31:35.344
Table throw!

31:38.681 --> 31:40.182
You're doing a great job, keep it up!

31:40.266 --> 31:41.725
Fuck you!

31:45.062 --> 31:47.398
Oh, God!

31:48.732 --> 31:49.775
Wrist bite!

31:49.859 --> 31:51.443
Paring knife!

31:51.527 --> 31:53.988
Clear. Keep that one alive.

31:56.907 --> 31:58.367
Kronish!

32:04.331 --> 32:05.666
You're coming with us.

32:05.749 --> 32:07.334
Fuck you, resistant scum!

32:13.757 --> 32:16.218
Son of a perf cock!

32:16.302 --> 32:18.345
He landed right on that lower-case T.

32:18.429 --> 32:20.222
We're out of Biotics.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.266
Guys, there's one more down here!

32:34.028 --> 32:36.488
No, please tell me you shat your dress.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.373
No, no, no, no, no!

33:01.680 --> 33:03.224
Shit, this is nuts.

33:13.192 --> 33:14.693
Bye-bye, brain bomb.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.262
She's going to detonate!

33:55.067 --> 33:57.278
Finally found a use for those things.

34:01.282 --> 34:02.783
She's alive, but we got a problem.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.410
- What, is she going to pop?
- Not yet.

34:04.493 --> 34:05.911
Didn't get a clean hit.

34:05.995 --> 34:08.871
Bomb's delayed, not deactivated.

34:08.956 --> 34:11.417
- Cool move, though.
- How long until her head blows?

34:11.500 --> 34:12.918
28 minutes.

34:16.045 --> 34:17.840
I really thought she liked me.
