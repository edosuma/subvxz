WEBVTT

00:00.334 --> 00:01.934
What's your trifling ass doing here?

00:01.936 --> 00:03.802
I want us to be a family again.

00:03.804 --> 00:05.404
Desna wants the office culture

00:05.406 --> 00:07.139
around here to be strictly professional.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.111
Yeah, Mac and Melba
wouldn't approve, either.

00:09.113 --> 00:10.275
Follow my lead.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.876
You need to start thinking
about protection.

00:11.878 --> 00:13.278
5K a month.

00:13.280 --> 00:14.546
Why'd you catch that beatdown?

00:14.548 --> 00:15.748
I'm the accountant for the biggest

00:15.750 --> 00:16.881
money launderer in the state.

00:16.883 --> 00:17.950
I asked for a pay raise

00:17.952 --> 00:19.484
to keep doing their dirty business.

00:19.486 --> 00:22.154
Up until now,
it's been don't ask, don't tell.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.355
Why don't we do the opposite?

00:23.357 --> 00:24.556
Do ask, do tell.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.091
For example, I recently had sex
with a man.

00:27.093 --> 00:28.711
The governor thought

00:28.713 --> 00:31.296
I was the woman
from Goldtouch Development.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.698
Contractors have been paying him off

00:33.700 --> 00:35.100
to build private prisons.

00:35.102 --> 00:36.635
That's why they killed Penelope.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.236
Dean, I am worried about you.

00:38.238 --> 00:41.439
- Can we please...
- Can't you see I got to focus, Virginia!

00:41.441 --> 00:43.175
I want you to stay away from him.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.778
And male companionship is
something I'm sorely lacking.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.245
How'd you learn to play mahjong?

00:47.247 --> 00:49.648
My dad taught me.
Your father teach you anything?

00:49.650 --> 00:50.849
The meaning of absence.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.651
Hi, Desna!

00:52.653 --> 00:54.118
We took your lover!

00:54.120 --> 00:56.388
This partnership with you,
not working out.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.723
You're gonna sign over
your interest in the casino.

00:58.725 --> 00:59.924
Otherwise...

00:59.926 --> 01:01.926
- Your lover dies.
- Shit.

01:01.928 --> 01:04.262
I thought you was gon' die out there.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.398
I think I love you, Roller.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.741
Do my doctorin' on you.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.276
Hey!

01:18.278 --> 01:19.411
Easy, D.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.813
- Stop acting like a...
- What's up?

01:20.815 --> 01:23.015
...crybaby.

01:23.017 --> 01:24.483
You know you like pain.

01:24.485 --> 01:26.111
Hey.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.553
Savage, D.

01:29.756 --> 01:30.955
That's why you the boss.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.693
I ain't the boss of that much these days.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.228
- Let me see.
- Mm.

01:36.230 --> 01:40.165
I do want to get my franchise
shit together, though.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.900
That's what you were about to do

01:41.902 --> 01:43.702
till you got lost in the sauce.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.422
I don't know.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.591
I just think that...

01:48.108 --> 01:50.975
maybe I just want to chill
for a little bit.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.977
Yeah. Me too, babe.

01:52.979 --> 01:54.979
Just lay up in the cut.

01:54.981 --> 01:56.448
You know what I was thinking, too?

01:56.450 --> 01:57.515
What was you thinking?

01:57.517 --> 01:59.436
You see them drapes right there?

01:59.920 --> 02:03.121
We trade those in for
some leather Versace drapes.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.567
We could classy up this spot.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.778
Um...

02:08.995 --> 02:10.328
We who? Who is we?

02:10.330 --> 02:11.329
Right there.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.131
No, no, no. But who is we?

02:13.133 --> 02:15.868
You and me, me and you... we.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.069
- What?
- Okay.

02:17.071 --> 02:19.337
D, all the shit we been through.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.674
Come on, girl. Plus, I'm already here.

02:21.676 --> 02:24.543
I'm lamped up here for how long?
Give me your hand.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.477
See? I'm thinkin', baby.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.412
I think you should pump the brakes.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.215
It was just, what,
less than two years ago,

02:30.217 --> 02:31.616
we was trying to bury each other,

02:31.618 --> 02:33.952
and now you want to be
all up in here livin' in sin?

02:33.954 --> 02:36.020
D, why you got to bring up old shit for?

02:36.022 --> 02:40.092
Roller, every man in my life
has disappointed me,

02:40.094 --> 02:41.960
failed me, and left me,

02:41.962 --> 02:43.428
starting with my damn daddy.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.764
D, first of all, I ain't every man,

02:45.766 --> 02:47.499
and I'm certainly not your daddy...

02:47.501 --> 02:50.102
unless you want me to be, baby.

02:50.104 --> 02:53.238
I love you, but I got to be sure

02:53.240 --> 02:55.039
that you are really down for me

02:55.041 --> 02:57.175
before I start splitting rent and shit.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.244
I mean, I don't know how you live.

02:59.246 --> 03:01.513
Do you even use Lawry's?

03:01.515 --> 03:02.781
- What?
- Do you?

03:02.783 --> 03:03.848
Bullshit, D.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.650
You gonna need help paying rent.

03:05.652 --> 03:07.219
Roller, hold up.

- Well, I'm j...
- Hey, y'all.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.115
- Hey, boo.
- Oh, hey, girl.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.518
Mac and Melba sent food again.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.653
Every day this week.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.854
Stale-ass onion bagels.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.990
"Enjoy the food. Stay away from us,

04:17.992 --> 04:19.791
and we'll stay away from you."

04:19.793 --> 04:21.593
Throw it in the trash.

04:21.595 --> 04:25.263
Look, we need to keep our asses
out of Bayside

04:25.265 --> 04:28.066
and just pretend like this
casino shit never happened.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.401
Yes, ma'am. We do...

04:29.403 --> 04:31.670
We do not need to... to go back there.

04:31.672 --> 04:32.537
No way. Unh-unh.

04:32.539 --> 04:34.139
I know we got bills to pay.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.408
I'ma figure out another way
to take care of y'all.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.679
In other news, Roller wants to move in.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.014
What?

04:42.016 --> 04:44.749
This is a bad idea, right?

04:44.751 --> 04:46.885
No! I say go for it.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.221
Me and Arlene already moved in
Tuesday night.

04:49.223 --> 04:51.223
- What?
- Damn, y'all nest quick.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.557
Well, maybe Roller's a lesbian,

04:52.559 --> 04:54.559
'cause his ass is picking out
drapes already.

04:54.561 --> 04:57.830
Girl, that boy,
he has real feelings for you.

04:57.832 --> 04:59.764
Roller is on some Drake shit.

04:59.766 --> 05:02.367
I don't got time for no real feelings,

05:02.369 --> 05:04.569
especially not after
what happened with Ruval.

05:04.571 --> 05:07.172
Uh, Des, Roller is hardly Ruval.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.573
They're both men.

05:08.575 --> 05:11.176
- Uh, let the church say "Amen."
- Amen.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.378
Sounds like someone has daddy issues.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.447
Okay, this is crazy 'cause me and Roller

05:15.449 --> 05:17.249
was just beefin' about that this morning.

05:17.251 --> 05:20.452
98% of trust issues come from bad dads,

05:20.454 --> 05:21.986
- according to Teen News.
- Teen News.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.522
I read that same thing.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.858
Paternal abandonment is the original sin

05:25.860 --> 05:27.125
of commitment-phobic women.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.394
- Mm-hmm.
- Heffa, your ass read it, too?

05:29.396 --> 05:30.663
It was in the break room.

05:30.665 --> 05:32.330
Girl, we all got dad shit.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.066
For instance, my dad left my mom
for a janitor

05:34.068 --> 05:35.534
at a dialysis clinic.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.202
He sure knows how to pick 'em.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.603
Mm-hmm. Des, your dad...

05:38.605 --> 05:41.614
your real dad... he's a...
he was a junkie, right?

05:41.616 --> 05:42.807
Not anymore.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.209
He's a big-time architect.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.478
I've been keeping tabs on him
for years now.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.280
- Do what?
- Why didn't you tell us?

05:48.282 --> 05:50.349
I haven't told anybody, not even Dean.

05:50.351 --> 05:51.684
Well, listen, tiny secret,

05:51.686 --> 05:53.351
maybe now it's time for you to reach out.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.753
Think about it, Des.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.889
Once I gave my dad a piece of my mind,

05:56.891 --> 05:58.156
it really freed me.

05:58.158 --> 05:59.958
Ain't gon' happen.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.694
This ain't "On Golden Pond."

06:02.897 --> 06:04.829
What kind of reference is that?

06:04.831 --> 06:09.501
That Roller is your knight in
shining ar-ar-armo-r-r, Desna.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.714
Hey, so, you living here now?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.048
You look a hot mess.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.517
Why don't you come home?

06:25.519 --> 06:27.586
I've got the fridge stocked
with kombucha.

06:27.588 --> 06:32.324
Virginia, push-ups bring oxygen
to my brain,

06:32.326 --> 06:34.392
which helps me stay focused.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.194
O-Okay, but you've been up in here

06:36.196 --> 06:37.862
every night this week.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.264
D-Don't exaggerate.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.266
Here's your açai smoothie, Dean.

06:41.268 --> 06:42.667
10:00 a.m. on the dot.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.279
Thanks, Julio.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.671
First-name basis?

06:46.673 --> 06:47.714
Isn't it great?

06:47.716 --> 06:49.341
Mac set me up with everything I need.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.477
Okay, but, hey, look,
what about what we need?

06:52.479 --> 06:53.946
What about our relationship?

06:53.948 --> 06:56.681
Virginia, we have a perfectly
functional relationship.

06:56.683 --> 06:59.417
You have more of a relationship
with Julio.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.552
Don't you love me anymore?

07:00.554 --> 07:01.886
Yeah, of course I love you.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.022
Virginia, you're being
pathologically needy.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.466
Mmm. There.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.870
Okay.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.163
I'm ready.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.765
Good luck.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.642
...so, when you get that
lil' itch in your noggin,

07:23.644 --> 07:27.446
you can resist by
using principle number five...

07:27.448 --> 07:29.514
get busy with something else.

07:29.516 --> 07:31.049
What about when you're vom-aching,

07:31.051 --> 07:32.584
when you're aching all over

07:32.586 --> 07:35.587
and you're sweating like a broken levee?

07:35.589 --> 07:37.790
Still number five... get busy!

07:37.792 --> 07:40.392
Hell, clean up the yard,
pick up them old car parts,

07:40.394 --> 07:43.061
that moon-moonshine kit
you know y'all got,

07:43.063 --> 07:45.782
and stay occupied.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.999
Idle hands are
the opiate-lover's playground,

07:50.001 --> 07:51.135
am I right?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.337
Now, we are out of time,

07:52.339 --> 07:56.084
but, uh, got a little bonus for y'all.

07:56.811 --> 08:00.881
Hot off the presses,
autographed by yours truly.

08:01.882 --> 08:05.750
I'm available
for book readings, signings,

08:05.752 --> 08:08.153
you know, corporate
team building, what have you.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.421
You can get your copy over there
on the...

08:09.423 --> 08:11.156
- Zaddy, you're here!
- ...table over there.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.557
Hey, Toblerone.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.493
Is that a little girl's bathing suit?

08:14.495 --> 08:16.961
Uh, don't be jelly.

08:16.963 --> 08:18.009
Hold up.

08:18.011 --> 08:19.764
I-I thought we agreed
she couldn't be here.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.834
Come on, Bryce, don't get
your panties in a wad, alright?

08:21.836 --> 08:24.436
She's a desperate soul
that needs some help.

08:24.438 --> 08:25.704
Where's your compassion?

08:25.706 --> 08:28.373
Hiding with my nuts
in case Jenn finds out.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.708
Look, I'm no fool, alright?

08:29.710 --> 08:32.044
It's either her or me in this rehab.

08:32.046 --> 08:33.778
Oh, come on, now.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.316
I can't turn my back on this, uh, angel.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.087
Oops.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.322
Now, listen here. Bryce, I'ma give you

08:44.324 --> 08:46.324
an ultimatorium, okay?

08:46.326 --> 08:48.527
You make it work with Brenda here

08:48.529 --> 08:50.729
or you can "Get It, Get It"
somewhere else.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.064
Fine.

08:52.066 --> 08:53.558
I quit.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.936
Good luck when Jenn bombs
the shit out of this place.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.738
Come on, now, Bryce!

08:59.740 --> 09:02.274
We're right here,
a-a Husser family breakthrough!

09:02.276 --> 09:03.443
Come on!

09:04.010 --> 09:05.236
Shit.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.612
Thank you, Clay.

09:07.614 --> 09:11.083
Did you mean it
when you called me an angel?

09:11.085 --> 09:12.351
I sure did.

09:12.353 --> 09:14.887
You remind me
of my poor, dead wife, Juanda.

09:14.889 --> 09:17.222
- Bless her soul.
- Except for the dead part.

09:17.224 --> 09:18.891
Well, yeah, yeah. You're alive.

09:18.893 --> 09:23.004
Well, you are a good, strong, decent man.

09:23.564 --> 09:26.049
And that makes you a rare treasure.

09:27.033 --> 09:29.033
Thank you.

09:29.035 --> 09:33.171
And I know someone real good
who can replace Bryce.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.908
Hey, V, make sure
the other ones are extra spicy.

09:35.910 --> 09:37.375
- Yeah.
- Hey.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.561
What's up, baby?

09:41.315 --> 09:42.981
D, my bad about this morning.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.383
I was trippin'.

09:44.385 --> 09:45.718
I'ma pump the brakes.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.852
We good. Okay?

09:47.854 --> 09:51.924
It's probably just my
trust-issue baggage bullshit.

09:51.926 --> 09:54.793
Shit. We all got those Louis Vs, baby.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.662
Hmm. The girls at the salon
was trying to say

09:57.664 --> 09:59.664
they felt all my issues
stem from the fact

09:59.666 --> 10:01.400
that my pops left me

10:01.402 --> 10:02.935
and that if I just talked to him,

10:02.937 --> 10:05.618
all my trust issues would just... poof...

10:05.620 --> 10:06.738
be worked out.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.206
That's that white people shit, D.

10:09.543 --> 10:11.343
Let the healing begin.

10:11.345 --> 10:13.211
What you think? You gon' do it?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.147
Mm. I feel some type of way.

10:15.149 --> 10:16.749
I mean, he probably
don't want to talk to me.

10:16.751 --> 10:20.145
Probably all bougie now,
dating white women and shit.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.021
Could be good for Deanie, though.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.489
Just sayin'.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.958
What kind of man does that?

10:25.960 --> 10:28.426
How you dip on your family, get put on,

10:28.428 --> 10:31.563
- and never look back?
- I hear you, D.

10:31.565 --> 10:35.233
But if I had an opportunity
to speak to my pop again,

10:35.235 --> 10:36.568
I'd take it.

10:37.438 --> 10:38.971
I'ma call you.

10:45.045 --> 10:46.178
10 stores in a week.

10:46.180 --> 10:47.312
Not too shabby.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.584
I love the smell of extortion
in the morning.

10:52.586 --> 10:54.519
As long as Mac and Melba don't find out.

10:54.521 --> 10:56.921
Yeah, or Desna, for that matter.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.725
Ooh, baby.

11:07.734 --> 11:08.933
Take out your dick.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.268
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.804
Hold on. Hold on.

11:11.806 --> 11:14.272
You know, I still have no idea
who the real Polly Marks is.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.141
Careful what you wish for.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.209
No, no, no, no, no.

11:17.211 --> 11:18.661
Seriously.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.346
I want to know.

11:30.024 --> 11:31.719
When I'm with you,

11:33.519 --> 11:35.887
I don't feel so broken.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.348
That scares the crap out of me.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.047
Mm.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.981
That's for little ol' me?

11:56.983 --> 11:59.518
I'm falling for you, Polly girl.

12:06.661 --> 12:09.528
Excuse me. Is Calvin Simms here?

12:09.530 --> 12:12.330
Yes, ma'am. Right over there.

12:12.332 --> 12:14.099
Thanks.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.014
Calvin Simms?

12:20.941 --> 12:22.267
Yes?

12:23.477 --> 12:25.810
Nice building.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.681
Thank you very much.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.198
Is there something I can help you with?

12:41.428 --> 12:42.694
Ooh, I...

12:42.696 --> 12:44.496
Ooh, I had a whole speech.

12:44.498 --> 12:45.964
Uh...

12:47.968 --> 12:51.169
You... really don't recognize me?

12:51.171 --> 12:52.589
Should I?

12:53.908 --> 12:56.681
I'm your daughter... Desna.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.190
Can we talk about this some other time?

13:10.991 --> 13:13.926
Can we talk about it another time?

13:13.928 --> 13:15.594
I mean, I'm here now
wanting to talk to you

13:15.596 --> 13:17.129
about me and Dean and...

13:17.131 --> 13:20.799
Now, you... you...
you can't just come by my job

13:20.801 --> 13:22.827
and drop this on me.

13:25.472 --> 13:31.076
I have imagined this moment for so long.

13:31.078 --> 13:36.014
And I feel stupid for
ever wanting anything from you.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.083
Well, I can't do this now.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.684
Please leave.

13:42.757 --> 13:46.358
Alright, fellas. What do you say
we move upstairs?

13:58.205 --> 14:01.206
Dean, I nee... I need you
to call me back, okay?

14:01.208 --> 14:04.342
I saw someone today and, um...

14:04.344 --> 14:07.121
Shit. Ju... Just call me.

14:10.818 --> 14:12.751
Mahjong, again.

14:14.622 --> 14:16.354
Well done, Dean.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.291
It's amazing how far you've come.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.026
I've got something for you.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.628
Okay.

14:22.630 --> 14:26.097
My grandfather gave this
to my father who gave it to me.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.633
Before your father kicked you out?

14:27.635 --> 14:30.902
Yeah. I was his favorite until
I dropped out of med school.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.904
Oh, this is real nice.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.306
Real ivory?

14:34.308 --> 14:36.025
Yeah.

14:36.576 --> 14:38.109
Excuse me.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.577
Can you give us a minute?

14:39.579 --> 14:41.447
- Yeah.
- What?

14:41.449 --> 14:43.982
Why are you still working
that man-turtle?

14:43.984 --> 14:46.452
He was just supposed
to be our way into Desna.

14:46.454 --> 14:48.654
But we don't need him anymore.

14:48.656 --> 14:49.855
Dean is a sweet kid,

14:49.857 --> 14:51.857
and he's an amazing mahjong player.

14:51.859 --> 14:54.326
You can't keep picking up strays.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.129
What would the Professor say
about this latest protégé?

14:57.131 --> 14:58.396
Professor can just relax.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.865
If Dean becomes a big player,

14:59.867 --> 15:01.533
he's gonna bring in a lot of customers.

15:01.535 --> 15:04.402
This isn't about revenue and you know it.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.938
Why can't you put your attention
on something productive,

15:06.940 --> 15:08.140
like your school?

15:08.142 --> 15:10.542
There's time for that.

15:10.544 --> 15:13.438
You're hittin' that a little
heavy lately, aren't you?

15:15.483 --> 15:16.882
Pick someone else.

15:16.884 --> 15:19.617
Don't re-engage Desna.

15:27.828 --> 15:31.830
Let me see. Work it, bitch!

15:31.832 --> 15:33.098
Yes.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.501
Alright, I'ma see you
at Essence Fest, okay?

15:35.503 --> 15:37.235
Yeah, and make sure you bring
your shea butter

15:37.237 --> 15:40.572
and dro because you know how we do.

15:40.574 --> 15:42.107
Owww.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.909
This is quite a tan you got going.

15:43.911 --> 15:46.111
Mm. Yas, queen!

15:46.113 --> 15:48.046
And you know the 'Gram can't get enough

15:48.048 --> 15:52.450
of this mocha choco-late, ya, ya.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.119
You should get tips from Rachel Dolezal

15:54.121 --> 15:55.987
about welfare fraud.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.357
What's her tag?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.393
So, your... your mama
came by the rehab today.

16:01.395 --> 16:02.728
Well, please tell me you steered clear

16:02.730 --> 16:04.530
of that hatchet-faced skank.

16:04.532 --> 16:07.065
I can smell Jean Naté from here.
I knew it.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.133
Oh, yeah, no, of course.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.602
Team Jenn all the way. I just...

16:10.604 --> 16:14.206
told Uncle Daddy I'm just
not gon' work there anymore.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.607
Well, that's the least
you could do, baby.

16:15.609 --> 16:17.609
I said I quit a job I love for you.

16:17.611 --> 16:19.144
I don't know
what you want me to do, babe.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.812
You want a piece of ass
for doing the right thing?

16:20.814 --> 16:23.007
Okurr, bitch.

16:23.817 --> 16:27.419
Yeah, girl. We trappin' in these
streets tonight, biatch.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.355
I'm keeping it 100 with these niglets.

16:29.357 --> 16:31.022
Unh-unh! No, no, no, girl.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.425
Come on. You know that you
my straight-up main nig...

16:33.427 --> 16:34.543
- No, bitch!
- You gots to go.

16:34.545 --> 16:35.761
Hey! Jennifer!

16:35.763 --> 16:38.230
- I just have to.
- I really do.

16:38.232 --> 16:39.497
Hello?! Is anybody seeing this?!

16:39.499 --> 16:41.433
It's a wrap on that minstrel show.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.235
Hey! Ow! Hey! Watch my tracks!

16:43.237 --> 16:44.370
Don't struggle.

16:46.374 --> 16:49.575
White people are just really on one.

16:49.577 --> 16:53.579
If it's not that hooker,
it's Melba with her...

16:53.581 --> 16:55.313
papoose or Roller,

16:55.315 --> 16:58.584
my white-chocolate brother-in-law
doing the absolute most.

16:58.586 --> 17:00.252
And we...

17:00.254 --> 17:02.054
Well, I did slick down
my baby hairs today and...

17:02.056 --> 17:03.321
Well, they're edge... And what I...

17:03.323 --> 17:04.521
Am I a part of the problem?

17:04.523 --> 17:05.590
Am I doing it? I'm... I'm one of 'em.

17:05.593 --> 17:06.858
- I'm doing it.
- Kinda.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.393
But we invite you to the cookout, girl.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.727
Okay.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.463
Guess who saw their father today.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.665
And his ass act like
he didn't even know me.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.800
Oh, babe, I am so sorry.

17:15.803 --> 17:17.335
That's his loss then.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.869
Girl, I mean, the hell with him.

17:21.675 --> 17:24.409
Des, I don't know how to tell you this,

17:24.411 --> 17:27.479
but your brother's been living
at the casino.

17:27.481 --> 17:30.282
This negro thinks
he's in "The Joy Luck Club"

17:30.284 --> 17:31.683
and won't stop playing mahjong.

17:31.685 --> 17:33.285
Oh, Lord. Dean's doing it, too.

17:33.287 --> 17:35.753
Okay, he told me he was gon'
keep his ass out of there.

17:35.755 --> 17:37.022
Well, girl, he lied.

17:37.024 --> 17:38.556
He's a mahjong crackhead.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.558
You know, Teen News says...

17:40.560 --> 17:41.759
- Shut up.
- Bryce.

17:41.761 --> 17:42.695
Mnh-mnh.

17:47.835 --> 17:51.903
I know what you and Joe have been doing.
Excuse me?

17:51.905 --> 17:54.706
The money y'all are extorting
from shops around town.

17:54.708 --> 17:56.374
Whatever do you mean?

17:56.376 --> 17:58.844
I wonder what Mac and Melba
would say about that.

17:58.846 --> 18:00.112
Not to mention Desna.

18:00.114 --> 18:01.113
Okay, what do you want?

18:01.115 --> 18:02.648
I want what's mine.

18:02.650 --> 18:04.316
You already took Joe.

18:04.318 --> 18:06.584
You had a thing with Joe?

18:06.586 --> 18:08.454
I had the thing with Joe.

18:08.456 --> 18:10.322
You understand how hard that is to find?

18:10.324 --> 18:12.724
He told me I was his cocoa-baby girl.

18:12.726 --> 18:15.593
Aren't you a little old for baby girl?

18:15.595 --> 18:18.530
Hey! And then at the drop
of a dime... poof, gone!

18:18.532 --> 18:21.133
Ever since you came around
with your pasty white-boy ass.

18:22.336 --> 18:24.002
You have 24 hours to cut me in

18:24.004 --> 18:25.070
on your little side hustle

18:25.072 --> 18:26.872
or I'm blowing your shit up!

18:38.552 --> 18:39.885
You can't be here, Ms. Simms.

18:39.887 --> 18:42.588
Kiss the dark side of my ass.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.892
Where's my brother?

18:46.894 --> 18:49.227
Dean is happy here.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.896
What the hell do you
even know about Dean?

18:50.898 --> 18:53.965
Oh, I know that he resents you
for trying to control his life.

18:53.967 --> 18:57.102
Now, please leave unless
you want to get thrown out.

18:57.104 --> 19:00.038
Believe me, this is the...

19:00.040 --> 19:01.639
last place I want to be.

19:01.641 --> 19:05.310
And when my brother finds out
that you tried to murder me,

19:05.312 --> 19:07.112
he ain't gon' want to be
up in here either.

19:07.114 --> 19:09.447
Well, good luck on convincing him.

19:09.449 --> 19:12.384
What is the deal with you and Dean?

19:12.386 --> 19:14.853
I mean, you already got the casino.

19:14.855 --> 19:16.722
- You won.
- Yeah, I know.

19:16.724 --> 19:19.725
That's why you're still alive.
Lucky girl.

19:19.727 --> 19:21.635
Stay away from my brother.

19:21.637 --> 19:22.728
Get off of me.

19:22.730 --> 19:24.396
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.

19:24.398 --> 19:26.798
And good luck on getting him to.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.267
- Get her out of here.
- Come on. Let's go.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.670
- Come on.
- Get off of me.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.474
Dean, please call me back.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.811
Okay, Mac and Melba
are not good people, Dean.

19:39.813 --> 19:40.879
They hurt people.

19:40.881 --> 19:42.480
They tried to kill me.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.149
You got to get out of there.

19:44.151 --> 19:46.351
- Baby, please call me back.
- Des.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.553
- Des.
- What?

19:47.555 --> 19:49.888
There's somebody here to see you.

19:55.229 --> 19:57.221
Hi, Desna.

20:02.636 --> 20:03.902
How did you find me?

20:03.904 --> 20:07.506
Well, the same way you found me, I guess.

20:07.508 --> 20:08.907
I owe you an apology.

20:08.909 --> 20:10.041
Unh-unh.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.643
We good.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.778
But you can get your
deadbeat ass out of my salon.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.913
Look, you caught me off guard.

20:14.915 --> 20:17.048
I have been dreading that moment
for decades.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.984
Wow. Wow!

20:18.986 --> 20:20.786
That's not what I-I meant.

20:20.788 --> 20:22.721
What I meant to say is I panicked.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.523
I'm sorry I put you out.

20:24.525 --> 20:26.591
Huh? How you think we felt

20:26.593 --> 20:28.127
when your black ass walked out on us?

20:28.129 --> 20:29.594
What I... What I was trying to say...

20:29.596 --> 20:30.662
No, no, no. No, no, no.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.263
Do you have any idea

20:32.265 --> 20:34.333
what it was like for me and my brother?

20:34.335 --> 20:36.886
You left, Lola went to jail.

20:37.938 --> 20:42.607
We was... We was in one shitty
foster home after the next,

20:42.609 --> 20:44.009
not able to trust people,

20:44.011 --> 20:46.678
and all the while thinking
this shit was our fault.

20:48.064 --> 20:49.748
And...

20:49.750 --> 20:51.282
Why are you here?

20:51.284 --> 20:52.485
Hmm?

20:54.621 --> 20:56.697
For the longest time,

20:58.159 --> 21:01.693
I tried to pretend like you didn't exist.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.028
Now, look.

21:03.030 --> 21:06.207
I don't know how this is supposed to go,

21:07.434 --> 21:09.168
but I'm trying.

21:12.039 --> 21:14.439
Can you meet me halfway?

21:19.312 --> 21:22.181
...so I cracked his head open
with a canoe oar,

21:22.183 --> 21:24.649
then I fed his ferret
to his pet alligator.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.718
The next day, the son of a bitch
called the cops.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.120
Well, the problem is, you still love him.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.590
Oh, no. I despise my son.

21:31.592 --> 21:34.459
Okay, the opposite of love isn't hate.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.794
It's indifference.

21:35.796 --> 21:38.063
You have to let go of your anger

21:38.065 --> 21:41.466
if you want to get over
the situation and get clean.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.068
Amen, sister.

21:43.070 --> 21:45.136
Thank you for bringing Ricki Lake over.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.283
We needed a good counselor

21:46.308 --> 21:47.539
- since Bryce left.
- I got you.

21:47.541 --> 21:50.409
It's the least I could
do for driving him off.

21:50.411 --> 21:52.611
She's got a real gift.

21:52.613 --> 21:54.880
Yeah, that she do, and I knew that.

21:54.882 --> 21:56.748
Can't believe I didn't think
about this myself.

21:56.750 --> 21:59.818
Well, you've got a lot of things
on your mind.

22:06.427 --> 22:08.269
I don't know what to say.

22:08.896 --> 22:11.230
One year becomes five

22:11.232 --> 22:13.098
and then 10, then 20.

22:13.100 --> 22:15.767
I'm sorry I never tried to find you.

22:15.769 --> 22:20.439
Where was your sorry
when Lola left us alone

22:20.441 --> 22:22.908
while she was out smoking rocks?

22:22.910 --> 22:24.443
- Hmm?
- I was addicted, too.

22:24.445 --> 22:27.112
I wasn't good for anybody,
least of all you two.

22:27.114 --> 22:31.250
I-I-I been divorced twice,
never had any more kids.

22:31.252 --> 22:35.254
I can't promise you
any kind of magical reunion,

22:35.256 --> 22:38.323
you know, but I would like to get to know

22:38.325 --> 22:39.991
you and your brother.

22:39.993 --> 22:41.392
If it's not too late.

22:41.394 --> 22:44.472
Well, Dean is not speaking to me
right now.

22:45.466 --> 22:47.866
So you're on your own with that.

22:47.868 --> 22:50.001
You can find him at the mahjong tables,

22:50.003 --> 22:51.729
Bayside Rapture.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.573
Shoot your shot.

22:59.146 --> 23:01.613
Excuse me, ma'am.
This area is off-limits to...

23:01.615 --> 23:02.948
Polygon, what are you...

23:02.950 --> 23:04.950
It's dangerous for you
to keep showing up.

23:04.952 --> 23:06.685
You need to be careful coming back here.

23:06.687 --> 23:07.886
I know.

23:07.888 --> 23:09.688
That's why I'm dressed like a Golden Girl

23:09.690 --> 23:11.690
at the penny slots.

23:11.692 --> 23:14.710
I just had a run-in with Yolanda.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.828
Were y'all together?

23:16.830 --> 23:18.130
Yola...

23:18.832 --> 23:20.966
That was... Look, it was nothing.

23:20.968 --> 23:22.433
- Uh-huh.
- Okay? Trust me.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.035
Oh, well, it must have been
something to her

23:24.037 --> 23:25.904
because she's been following us around,

23:25.906 --> 23:27.639
and she knows all about our little scam.

23:27.641 --> 23:29.841
- What?
- Yeah. She wants a cut.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.176
And if I don't give it to her,

23:31.178 --> 23:32.777
she's gonna rat us out to everybody, Joe.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.046
Yeah, Yolanda squawks really loud, okay,

23:35.048 --> 23:37.449
but she's not a threat at all.

23:37.451 --> 23:38.650
She's just jealous.

23:38.652 --> 23:40.119
She pushed me down.

23:40.121 --> 23:43.322
You have nothing to worry about.

23:43.324 --> 23:44.589
It's nothing.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.257
You sure?

23:46.259 --> 23:47.526
Promise.

23:50.063 --> 23:54.866
Welcome, everyone,
to day one of Bayside's Mahjong Mayhem.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.005
If everyone will please find a table,

24:00.007 --> 24:02.407
play will begin in 30 seconds.

24:02.409 --> 24:06.077
- This seat available?
- Yes. But be warned, I'm very good.

24:06.079 --> 24:07.879
Noted.

24:14.688 --> 24:17.756
What I love about architecture
is everything has a plan,

24:17.758 --> 24:20.359
everything has a place and a purpose.

24:20.361 --> 24:23.294
All the angles fit.

24:23.296 --> 24:25.096
I-I used to draw houses.

24:25.098 --> 24:27.166
It's much easier than people
because they...

24:27.168 --> 24:28.767
they... they don't move.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.369
My sister took me
to all the nice neighborhoods

24:30.371 --> 24:32.103
in Sarasota to let me sketch.

24:32.105 --> 24:33.839
You know, rich white people
don't usually like it

24:33.841 --> 24:35.174
when you're near their house,

24:35.176 --> 24:37.709
but it's helpful if you have a sketchpad.

24:41.314 --> 24:44.315
You see that guy at the table with Dean?

24:44.317 --> 24:46.317
I want to know all about him.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.721
We should have his credit card on file.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.590
I'm on it.

24:51.592 --> 24:53.392
What houses did you draw?

24:53.394 --> 24:55.527
Um, uh, The Ringling.

24:55.529 --> 24:58.730
Um, uh, we would go up and down Bayshore.

24:58.732 --> 25:02.868
The Sarasota Contemporary Art
Institute was my favorite.

25:02.870 --> 25:04.203
Mahjong!

25:04.205 --> 25:07.005
Oh, damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

25:07.007 --> 25:09.140
You dis... You distracted...
You distracted me!

25:09.142 --> 25:10.542
Dean? It's okay.

25:10.544 --> 25:13.078
We can go grab a bite to eat
now that the game is over.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.480
- Talk about Sarasota...
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:15.482 --> 25:17.616
I have ano... I have another game
...I have another game to play.

25:17.618 --> 25:19.684
- I have another game.
- I-I think you should take a break.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.886
I don't... I don't take breaks!

25:20.888 --> 25:22.487
Thank you very much for the conversation.

25:22.489 --> 25:23.889
Um, I have to focus now.

25:23.891 --> 25:26.467
Thank you.
Thank you for the conversation.

25:27.561 --> 25:28.960
I have to focus.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.433
- Are you ok...
- Yes! I... Please, please.

25:34.435 --> 25:35.901
I'm sorry.
Don't... Don't touch me, please.

25:35.903 --> 25:37.636
Uh, please don't touch me.

25:37.638 --> 25:39.438
Thank you.

25:39.897 --> 25:42.040
Okay, so let me get this straight.

25:42.042 --> 25:44.576
You quit and now you're mad

25:44.578 --> 25:46.978
that Virginia's up in there
working her magic?

25:46.980 --> 25:48.313
Magically magic.

25:48.315 --> 25:50.982
She ain't qualified. Okay? Just...

25:50.984 --> 25:53.118
You know, there is a world
of difference...

25:53.120 --> 25:55.587
a world of difference...
between fortune cookie sayings

25:55.589 --> 25:58.990
and deep down counseling
that comes from four hours

25:58.992 --> 26:01.793
of online coursework
at Palmetto Junior College.

26:03.409 --> 26:04.653
It should be me in there.

26:04.655 --> 26:07.132
So tell Uncle Daddy
you want your job back.

26:07.134 --> 26:09.468
But my hands are tied
as long as Brenda's in there.

26:09.470 --> 26:11.937
Just... So fix the problem
with Jenn and Brenda

26:11.939 --> 26:13.872
and go claim what's yours.

26:17.544 --> 26:19.611
Ooh. Y'all, I got to run.

26:19.613 --> 26:20.946
I just... I...

26:20.948 --> 26:23.348
I totally forgot I have a colonic today.

26:23.350 --> 26:24.549
So sorry.

26:24.551 --> 26:26.551
Didn't you just get a colonic?

26:26.553 --> 26:28.287
It's a vicious cycle.

26:28.289 --> 26:29.630
I got you.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.532
Sweep!

26:32.426 --> 26:34.493
Finish this up.

26:36.497 --> 26:37.629
Oh, wow.

26:37.631 --> 26:39.164
Would you look at that.

26:39.166 --> 26:42.033
A-A-A-Another chow.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.369
Mahjong.

26:46.373 --> 26:48.573
Yeah. Mahjong.

26:48.575 --> 26:50.509
Oh, hey... hey, Denise.

26:51.312 --> 26:52.720
Thank you.

26:54.381 --> 26:55.604
- Hey.
- Oh!

26:55.606 --> 26:56.648
- Oh.
- Sorry.

26:56.650 --> 26:57.649
Hey, Desi. Hey, Desi.

26:57.651 --> 26:59.250
Baby, we need to talk.

26:59.252 --> 27:00.919
- Now is not a good time.
- No, no, now.

27:00.921 --> 27:02.988
Listen, Dean, you remember Calvin?

27:02.990 --> 27:05.724
Yeah. He's the reason
I lost my last game, yes.

27:05.726 --> 27:07.526
Okay, well... Dean, look at me.

27:07.528 --> 27:11.238
Hey, hey, hey. Calvin is our father.

27:12.399 --> 27:14.599
Well, tha... that's... that's impossible.

27:14.601 --> 27:16.668
Ou... Our fa... Our father's...
father's a drug addict

27:16.670 --> 27:19.070
that you said is probably
dead in a ditch somewhere.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.472
Well, Dean, this is him.

27:21.474 --> 27:23.074
Mmmmm.

27:23.076 --> 27:25.010
Dean, you can't be so distracted
by this game

27:25.012 --> 27:26.477
that you don't want to meet your father.

27:26.479 --> 27:27.679
- I don't want to talk about this, Des!
- Shh!

27:27.681 --> 27:29.280
- I-I don't want to ta...
- Dean, Dean.

27:29.282 --> 27:30.749
What if I told you that I could get us

27:30.751 --> 27:35.620
a-a private tour of the Sarasota
Contemporary Arts Institute?

27:35.622 --> 27:38.089
Hmm? We could have the whole
place to ourselves.

27:38.091 --> 27:39.624
Would that interest you at all?

27:39.626 --> 27:41.092
But that's... that's...
that's been closed for years.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.427
Nobod... Nobody has access to that.

27:42.429 --> 27:45.164
I do. My firm did the restoration

27:45.166 --> 27:47.900
- to the building.
- They did restoration to the...

27:51.104 --> 27:52.504
I don't mean to rush you, baby,

27:52.506 --> 27:54.506
but we got to get the hell
out of here now.

27:54.508 --> 27:56.307
- Come on. I'll bring you back.
- O-O-O-Okay. Okay, everybody.

27:56.309 --> 27:58.309
I'm gonna visit a neoclassical landmark.

27:58.311 --> 28:00.412
But... But I'll... But I'll be back!

28:05.018 --> 28:07.819
Six months, hard work.

28:07.821 --> 28:09.955
Finally, we're done.

28:09.957 --> 28:11.465
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

28:12.492 --> 28:15.160
26 grooves each column.

28:15.162 --> 28:17.295
Oh, you... you count the grooves, too?

28:17.297 --> 28:18.364
Well, who doesn't?

28:18.366 --> 28:20.766
Well... Well, no one else I know.

28:20.768 --> 28:22.568
I'm... I'm... I'm always the...
I'm always the only one.

28:22.570 --> 28:23.769
It's just me.

28:23.771 --> 28:24.903
Ah, ah, ah!

28:24.905 --> 28:26.304
I-I don't... I don't like to be...

28:26.306 --> 28:27.773
I don't like to be touched.

28:27.775 --> 28:29.908
Uh, um, did you know... did you know...

28:29.910 --> 28:32.444
did you know that people
unfairly grouped this design

28:32.446 --> 28:34.580
in with the Neo-colonial Movement?

28:34.582 --> 28:36.648
- Oh, yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, but I-I think

28:36.650 --> 28:38.650
it has more to do with Greek Revival.

28:38.652 --> 28:41.653
Well, that's exactly what
I wrote on my graduate thesis.

28:41.655 --> 28:43.789
Oh. Where do you stand on Le Corbusier?

28:43.791 --> 28:46.524
I-I'm more of
a Mies van der Rohe man myself.

28:46.526 --> 28:47.393
Oh.

28:47.395 --> 28:49.661
Yes. Speaking my language.

28:56.136 --> 28:58.070
This is just like old times.

28:58.072 --> 28:59.271
I know you lyin'.

28:59.273 --> 29:01.072
We ain't had no old times.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.274
No, no, no.

29:02.276 --> 29:03.475
Alright, no, that's fair enough.

29:03.477 --> 29:04.743
That's fair enough.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.745
But I've got to say,
I am amazed at how well

29:06.747 --> 29:08.614
the two of you have done for yourselves.

29:08.616 --> 29:12.684
That must have taken a
tremendous amount of strength.

29:12.686 --> 29:14.886
I'm so proud of both of you.

29:14.888 --> 29:16.488
Uh, Des... Desi.

29:16.490 --> 29:19.691
Desi. I-I-I have... I have
to get back to the game.

29:19.693 --> 29:22.160
- Dean...
- I-I have to get back to the game.

29:22.162 --> 29:24.362
Dean, take it from me.

29:24.364 --> 29:25.964
I-It's great to love something,

29:25.966 --> 29:28.233
but you can't let that control your life.

29:28.235 --> 29:29.567
I'm not smoking crack.

29:29.569 --> 29:31.437
I'm just playing mahjong, Calvin.

29:31.439 --> 29:34.172
And... And... And I can
walk away at any time.

29:34.174 --> 29:35.507
We hard... We hardly even know you.

29:35.509 --> 29:36.975
You can't give me any advice.

29:36.977 --> 29:38.376
- Dean, stop it.
- But he can't...

29:38.378 --> 29:39.978
Hey, no, he's right.

29:39.980 --> 29:41.713
He's absolutely right.

29:41.715 --> 29:44.582
But how 'bout we take this time
to get to know each other?

29:44.584 --> 29:50.255
Huh? There's a dedication
ceremony here tonight.

29:50.257 --> 29:52.790
I'd love it if you two
would be my guests.

29:52.792 --> 29:53.791
Huh?

29:53.793 --> 29:56.486
Why don't you let us think about it?

29:57.131 --> 29:58.596
Take it in baby steps.

29:58.598 --> 30:00.332
Of course, we... we got to take our time.

30:00.334 --> 30:01.950
I-I have to go back.

30:02.736 --> 30:04.202
I have to go back to the game.

30:10.077 --> 30:11.477
What?

30:11.479 --> 30:14.012
Look at you being all domestic.

30:14.014 --> 30:16.548
Hey, D, don't be mad at me, but...

30:17.284 --> 30:19.676
Look at these. They shrunk.

30:20.420 --> 30:23.955
No. That's the size it's supposed to be.

30:25.625 --> 30:27.359
How was your day with your pop?

30:27.361 --> 30:29.227
It was really nice.

30:29.229 --> 30:31.429
See what happens
when you listen to me, D?

30:31.431 --> 30:33.565
- Huh?
- Okay, I admit it.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.651
It was cool hanging out with Calvin.

30:36.436 --> 30:38.303
Roller, let's do it.

30:38.305 --> 30:39.905
Shit, let's do it, baby.

30:41.441 --> 30:44.510
What? I'm not talking about sex.

30:44.512 --> 30:46.512
I'm talking about me and you.

30:46.514 --> 30:48.980
I want you to move in here.

30:48.982 --> 30:49.981
For real?

30:49.983 --> 30:51.850
For real, for real.

30:51.852 --> 30:54.853
As long as you gon' go half
on these bills.

30:54.855 --> 30:57.989
Yeah. Since I'm not
at the casino anymore.

30:57.991 --> 30:59.457
50/50, baby.

30:59.459 --> 31:01.727
I see O.G. Calvin talked
some sense into you, huh?

31:01.729 --> 31:03.661
I used to think people couldn't change,

31:03.663 --> 31:05.731
- but I was wrong.
- Mm-hmm.

31:05.733 --> 31:08.642
So I want to give shackin' up a shot.

31:09.803 --> 31:11.537
Mm.

31:11.539 --> 31:14.206
Mmm.

31:14.208 --> 31:17.409
Mm!

31:19.947 --> 31:21.780
Hello, Calvin.

31:23.083 --> 31:26.418
I-I'm sorry. You are?

31:26.420 --> 31:29.821
I want you out of Dean's life for good.

31:33.093 --> 31:34.918
You bribin' me?

31:35.896 --> 31:38.547
If you love Dean as much as I do,

31:40.100 --> 31:42.034
you will take this deal.

31:48.108 --> 31:49.608
Hello?

31:53.381 --> 31:55.647
Yoo-hoo?

31:55.649 --> 31:57.399
Yolanda?

31:59.387 --> 32:01.386
Hello?

32:01.388 --> 32:04.523
It's me. It's, uh... It's Polly.

32:06.326 --> 32:07.793
Hey, girl, hey.

32:07.795 --> 32:09.661
Uh...

32:09.663 --> 32:12.197
Got... I got what you asked for.

32:14.468 --> 32:15.734
Hello?

32:39.393 --> 32:42.861
Think back to your childhood,

32:42.863 --> 32:45.197
to your early dreams.

32:47.668 --> 32:49.267
Where's the cheesecake?

32:49.269 --> 32:52.004
- Huh? Oh, uh... What?
- Did they get all eaten?

32:52.006 --> 32:54.006
Baby, you said there was
gon' be cheesecake.

32:54.008 --> 32:55.765
- Nice work.
- What's going on?

32:56.410 --> 32:58.010
Oh, hell no.

32:58.012 --> 32:59.411
What? Is this some kind of intervention?

32:59.413 --> 33:01.079
- Absolutely not.
- No, no, no. Jenn, Jenn.

33:01.081 --> 33:02.547
Bryce, get out of my way.

33:02.549 --> 33:04.549
Come on, just give us
five minutes, alright, please.

33:04.551 --> 33:07.219
One. You get one.

33:07.221 --> 33:09.221
Principle number seven
of "Get It, Get It"...

33:09.223 --> 33:11.223
Final Solution... "Get It, Get It!"

33:11.225 --> 33:15.093
...is "Get past the past."

33:15.095 --> 33:18.030
We all want to wipe
the slate clean for ourselves,

33:18.032 --> 33:20.098
so why don't we just do it.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.300
Why not, I say? I mean, ju... just do it.

33:22.302 --> 33:24.769
We can all be reborn

33:24.771 --> 33:28.773
when we stop drinking the poison
for other people's crimes.

33:28.775 --> 33:29.842
Whoo! Reborn!

33:29.844 --> 33:31.376
Just like a shiny new baby.

33:31.378 --> 33:33.171
You know, re... You know...

33:33.173 --> 33:34.704
"Get It."

33:36.583 --> 33:37.782
So do it for yourself,

33:37.784 --> 33:42.320
but, hey, do it
for the people around you, too.

33:42.322 --> 33:45.590
Please, baby. Try not to think
of me as a dirty whore.

33:45.592 --> 33:48.593
Okay, well, why don't you
try not to act like one.

33:49.463 --> 33:50.529
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Virginia.

33:50.531 --> 33:52.531
- Oh.
- She just swoops right in.

33:52.533 --> 33:54.599
- Look at me.
- I'm lookin'.

33:54.601 --> 33:56.468
Your mama's betrayal brings you back

33:56.470 --> 33:59.003
to the first time you were truly hurt.

33:59.005 --> 34:00.072
Am I right?

34:00.074 --> 34:02.006
Okay. Um, yeah.

34:02.008 --> 34:03.542
Um, when I was in the second grade,

34:03.544 --> 34:06.010
I gave this boy that I loved
a special valentine,

34:06.012 --> 34:09.281
and, um, he, like, called me fat

34:09.283 --> 34:10.482
and he said I had scarecrow hair

34:10.484 --> 34:13.552
and he, um, said I smelled like wet dogs.

34:13.554 --> 34:17.089
And then he and his friends, um,
spit on me.

34:20.627 --> 34:24.563
And they made me watch while
they flushed it down the toilet.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.232
I remember that little punk.

34:27.234 --> 34:29.367
His name was Johnny Marshall.

34:29.369 --> 34:31.436
Yeah. It was Johnny Marshall,

34:31.438 --> 34:33.705
and you really, um, beat his ass
the next day.

34:36.176 --> 34:38.176
Well, he deserved it.

34:38.178 --> 34:39.844
She still loves you.

34:39.846 --> 34:40.844
I do.

34:40.847 --> 34:43.248
So much.

34:43.250 --> 34:44.583
Feel the energy.

34:44.585 --> 34:47.851
Please, baby, can you forgive me
even just a little?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.487
Mama...

34:50.257 --> 34:53.458
Mama.

34:56.196 --> 34:58.330
Get in there, boy. Come on, get in. Get.

34:58.332 --> 35:00.265
Go get it. Get it.

35:00.267 --> 35:02.200
- No, I'm not...
- "Get It, Get It."

35:08.809 --> 35:11.075
That son of a bitch
didn't take the money!

35:13.280 --> 35:15.280
Oh, sugar plum, sugar plum.

35:15.282 --> 35:17.349
Oh, honey, how can I make it better?

35:17.351 --> 35:20.060
I want Dean all to myself!

35:20.554 --> 35:23.939
Ask and you shall receive.

35:24.759 --> 35:27.660
You make my world sparkle.

35:31.966 --> 35:35.700
Hey, Polly-amorous.

35:35.702 --> 35:36.568
What's the matter?

35:36.570 --> 35:38.837
I just came from Yolanda's.

35:38.839 --> 35:43.976
She was hanging from the doorway
like a sack of potatoes.

35:43.978 --> 35:47.462
Joe, do you know anything about that?

35:49.183 --> 35:51.550
I knew she was battling with depression.

35:52.586 --> 35:54.803
This isn't a total surprise.

35:57.124 --> 35:58.923
And Penelope?

35:58.925 --> 36:00.192
You remember her?

36:00.194 --> 36:03.996
Was she also depressed?

36:09.603 --> 36:11.403
How sad.

36:11.405 --> 36:14.206
How very, very sad.

36:15.542 --> 36:18.076
So, you know I could never
hurt you, right?

36:19.480 --> 36:22.146
I bet you say that to all the girls.

36:22.148 --> 36:23.973
Polly, it's me.

36:23.975 --> 36:25.709
How many people have you killed?

36:26.887 --> 36:29.754
You really want to know?

36:29.756 --> 36:33.425
So, if anyone gets in your way,
they're just gone?

36:33.427 --> 36:36.829
- It's not like that.
- What happens if I get in your way?

36:36.831 --> 36:38.464
- Pol...
- No, don't.

36:41.035 --> 36:42.634
Don't.

36:57.651 --> 36:59.251
Oh.

36:59.253 --> 37:00.519
Butterfingers.

37:00.521 --> 37:01.986
Here, let me help.

37:10.797 --> 37:12.865
You're too kind...

37:12.867 --> 37:14.599
Cat daddy.

37:25.011 --> 37:26.679
"Cat daddy."

37:32.419 --> 37:34.086
Damn, D, this is pretty dope.

37:34.088 --> 37:36.020
Your dad did all this?

37:36.022 --> 37:37.906
Crazy, right?

37:38.959 --> 37:40.825
Virginia, what?

37:40.827 --> 37:43.896
Just happy to see you
outside of the casino.

37:43.898 --> 37:44.897
It's been a while.

37:44.899 --> 37:47.031
It gives me great pleasure

37:47.033 --> 37:50.569
to introduce the man
behind all this wonder,

37:50.571 --> 37:52.437
our captain as it were,

37:52.439 --> 37:55.307
the talented man whose reinvention

37:55.309 --> 37:57.375
of our local art institute

37:57.377 --> 38:00.779
will be appreciated
by generations to come.

38:00.781 --> 38:02.781
Mr. Calvin Simms.

38:06.120 --> 38:07.986
- Calvin?
- Hmm?

38:07.988 --> 38:10.188
Oh, thank you, thank you.

38:10.190 --> 38:11.990
Thank you.

38:11.992 --> 38:14.192
Um... I'm, uh... so, uh...

38:14.194 --> 38:15.327
I'm so humbled.

38:15.329 --> 38:17.996
I'm so humbled by your generosity, and...

38:17.998 --> 38:23.135
No, I-I-I'm...
I'm both generous and humble.

38:23.137 --> 38:24.736
What was it?

38:24.738 --> 38:26.413
What was it?

38:26.873 --> 38:29.007
- What's wrong with him?
- Shit. I think he's high.

38:29.009 --> 38:31.543
I thought you said he had his
addiction under control, Desi.

38:31.545 --> 38:33.411
I thought he did.

38:34.949 --> 38:36.949
Are you okay?

38:36.951 --> 38:39.017
I'm gonna be sick.

38:42.489 --> 38:43.888
Okay, I-I-I can't...

38:43.890 --> 38:45.690
Um, I got to... I got to... I-I can't.

38:45.692 --> 38:48.293
Um, I... because I...

38:48.295 --> 38:49.694
Shh. It's okay.

38:49.696 --> 38:50.895
- Let's go.
- Oh! Okay.

38:50.897 --> 38:52.097
Shit.

38:52.099 --> 38:53.098
Dean.

39:01.041 --> 39:03.409
Shit.

39:10.951 --> 39:12.418
You okay?

39:12.420 --> 39:13.738
You want to talk about your dad?

39:13.740 --> 39:14.752
No.

39:14.754 --> 39:17.022
I-I-I do... I do not.

39:17.024 --> 39:19.825
I-I have successfully
compartmentalized my feelings

39:19.827 --> 39:22.160
and will process them
at a different time.

39:22.162 --> 39:24.496
Okay, well, why can't you
process them with me?

39:24.498 --> 39:26.031
I'm actually really good at this.

39:26.033 --> 39:28.434
E-E-Excuse me.
I have to get to level four

39:28.436 --> 39:29.835
of a mahjong tournament.

39:29.837 --> 39:31.437
Could you... Could you
drive faster, please?

39:31.439 --> 39:34.840
Uh, uh, we are not going back
to the casino.

39:34.842 --> 39:35.907
It's late.

39:35.909 --> 39:37.709
Dean, please...

39:37.711 --> 39:39.845
Can we just go back to the motel

39:39.847 --> 39:42.781
and we can get our Anita Baker on, okay?

39:42.783 --> 39:45.717
I will give you the best I got.

39:45.719 --> 39:48.320
E-E-Either take me to the casino
or pull over

39:48.322 --> 39:49.988
so I can get my own Lyft, okay?

39:49.990 --> 39:52.024
Okay? Okay?

39:55.395 --> 39:57.395
Dean, really?

40:02.402 --> 40:05.804
Dean! Dean, please!

40:12.946 --> 40:14.146
Shut up and move!

40:14.148 --> 40:16.148
You shut up!

40:16.150 --> 40:17.483
Stupid bitch.

40:19.487 --> 40:20.581
Ann, hurry up!

40:20.583 --> 40:22.779
You missin' my story!

40:23.557 --> 40:25.524
I'll be there in a second!

40:33.300 --> 40:35.433
He told me he was off the shit.

40:35.435 --> 40:36.502
Oh, I know.

40:36.504 --> 40:38.236
You know, that's the reason

40:38.238 --> 40:40.638
why I didn't want to reach out
to his ass in the first place.

40:40.640 --> 40:42.440
Yeah, I hear you.
Open you heart to somebody,

40:42.442 --> 40:44.510
and then they just stomp all over it.

40:44.512 --> 40:47.045
Ann, what's going on? You okay?

40:47.047 --> 40:48.714
Actually...

40:48.716 --> 40:50.115
Hey.

40:50.117 --> 40:53.118
What happened last night,
that wasn't my fault.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.721
That's exactly what dopeheads say.

40:55.723 --> 40:56.722
It's not what you think.

40:56.724 --> 40:58.990
Ooh, they say that shit, too.

40:58.992 --> 41:01.109
No, somebody did something to me.

41:01.395 --> 41:03.261
Hear me out, okay?

41:03.263 --> 41:04.996
There was something I didn't tell you

41:04.998 --> 41:07.665
because I didn't know
if it was connected or not,

41:07.667 --> 41:09.667
but some fella from the casino

41:09.669 --> 41:12.270
offered me money to stay away from Dean.

41:12.272 --> 41:13.539
Mac.

41:13.541 --> 41:14.940
What the hell does that have to do

41:14.942 --> 41:16.808
with what happened last night, Calvin?

41:16.810 --> 41:18.676
You threw up on my shoes and shit!

41:18.678 --> 41:21.079
I'm sorry. And I... And I don't know.

41:21.081 --> 41:23.615
All I know is I told the guy to get lost,

41:23.617 --> 41:25.617
then I stop in some... some diner,

41:25.619 --> 41:27.685
and somebody must have dusted me there.

41:27.687 --> 41:29.154
Somebody like who, Calvin?

41:29.156 --> 41:30.822
I don't know.

41:30.824 --> 41:33.158
I was having a cup of coffee
before I went to the event,

41:33.160 --> 41:37.095
then all of a sudden,
I was out of my damn mind.

41:37.097 --> 41:39.497
There was this... this weird lady.

41:39.499 --> 41:40.832
- I helped her. She...
- Whoa, whoa.

41:40.834 --> 41:43.101
When you say, "weird," Calvin, weird how?

41:43.103 --> 41:45.703
She had emphysema or something.

41:45.705 --> 41:47.039
Shit. Did... Did she...

41:47.041 --> 41:50.242
Did she have a little oxygen tank?

41:50.244 --> 41:51.577
Yes.

41:53.781 --> 41:56.080
I know who did this to you.

41:57.585 --> 41:59.385
Calvin, I am so sorry.

41:59.387 --> 42:02.120
None of this is your fault.

42:02.122 --> 42:04.722
And I hate that I got you
mixed up in all this.

42:04.724 --> 42:05.791
Mixed up in all of what?

42:05.793 --> 42:08.126
What kind of shit are you into?

42:12.065 --> 42:14.866
Dean, I am trying to tell your black ass

42:14.868 --> 42:17.068
that Mac and Melba ain't no good!

42:17.070 --> 42:19.204
No one forced Calvin to take drugs.

42:19.206 --> 42:20.606
He was tricked.

42:20.608 --> 42:22.941
Dean, they dosed him.

42:22.943 --> 42:24.276
W-What's m-more believable?

42:24.278 --> 42:26.678
That someone secretly slipped him drugs

42:26.680 --> 42:28.213
or that an addict relapsed?

42:28.215 --> 42:29.815
M-Mac has been more of a father to me

42:29.817 --> 42:32.484
