WEBVTT

00:02.303 --> 00:04.372
Previously on Numbers:

00:04.405 --> 00:06.607
DAVID:
Mary Velasco, 29,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.376
found murdered
in her apartment.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.411
Initial suspect was
her boyfriend Clay Porter.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.612
COLBY:
Former Marine.

00:11.645 --> 00:12.746
DAVID: Porter was
part of a unit

00:12.780 --> 00:15.349
suspected of torturing
Iraqi detainees.

00:15.383 --> 00:16.517
I didn't do anything

00:16.550 --> 00:18.386
except watch you guys
and follow the case.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.553
For Mary,

00:19.587 --> 00:21.055
I wanted to see justice done.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.157
A friend of mine pulled
his Pentagon file.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.394
An inquiry found Clay Porter
innocent of charges in Iraq.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.762
Actually, it turns out he was
the guy who blew the whistle.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.364
(gunshot, man yells)

00:30.398 --> 00:31.765
Looks like Porter got
his justice.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.467
DAVID:
Then he shot Jared Parr.

00:33.501 --> 00:34.535
COLBY:
And now Corcoran.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.304
We checked out
Clay Porter's apartment.

00:36.337 --> 00:37.738
Yeah, the guy's
cleared out.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.440
Yeah, he's probably
in Mexico, right?

00:47.248 --> 00:49.583
ANNOUNCER: Johnson with the
ball, trying to find a way in...

00:49.617 --> 00:50.518
Yeah.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.519
That's McDonald.
Dribble drive underneath.

00:51.552 --> 00:52.453
Yeah, come on, man.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.421
Yeah, that's it, come on.
(whistle blows)

00:53.454 --> 00:55.789
Oh, damn! Man, what's
wrong with that boy?

00:55.823 --> 00:57.191
You know that man's
lost a step.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.392
Me, too,

00:58.426 --> 01:00.461
but I don't make $30 million
a year.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.496
It's not all about basketball.

01:02.530 --> 01:04.365
Have you seen his underwear ad?

01:04.398 --> 01:05.065
Oh...

01:05.099 --> 01:06.500
Hey, I don't want to hear this.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.236
(chuckling)

01:08.269 --> 01:10.538
(smoke alarm beeping)
Why is that alarm going off?

01:10.571 --> 01:11.705
I'm baking
brownies, Daddy.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.407
LAURIE: Burning them's more like
it.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.642
(chuckles)

01:14.675 --> 01:16.210
(beeping continues)

01:16.244 --> 01:17.645
*Dead sound
(beeping stops)

01:18.746 --> 01:21.182
* Dead sound

01:22.683 --> 01:23.584
* Dead sound

01:26.554 --> 01:28.656
(door bursts open, gun cocks)
Down on the floor now!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.258
- Hey! Hey!
- Now!

01:30.291 --> 01:31.859
Don't, don't, don't hurt us.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.261
Take what you want.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.129
I said on the floor!

01:35.163 --> 01:36.397
(blow lands, loud groan)

01:36.430 --> 01:37.565
Daddy!
(crashing)

01:37.598 --> 01:38.599
(groaning)

01:40.501 --> 01:41.569
I'm not going to ask you again.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.475
Is anyone else here?

01:47.508 --> 01:50.544
No.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.313
- Back rooms are clear.
- Check the kitchen.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.883
* Dead sound

01:57.218 --> 01:59.119
* Dead sound

02:00.588 --> 02:01.722
* Dead sound

02:03.224 --> 02:04.792
* Dead sound...

02:06.527 --> 02:09.430
(driving rock beat)

02:13.334 --> 02:16.204
CHARLIE: I-I was with that movie
all the way until that ending.

02:16.237 --> 02:18.472
Yeah, I know, it was like
The Sopranos all over again.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.907
Yeah, and I was right
about that, too.

02:19.940 --> 02:20.908
Hey.

02:20.941 --> 02:21.942
Hi.

02:21.975 --> 02:22.876
(chuckling):
Professor Waldie.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.945
What are you doing here
on a school night?

02:24.978 --> 02:27.915
Alan requested a consultation.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.450
Yeah, I figured if we're going
to "green" the house,

02:29.483 --> 02:30.584
couldn't go wrong
with the head

02:30.618 --> 02:32.286
of Cal Sci Engineering,
could I?

02:32.320 --> 02:34.222
- Great idea.
- This looks more like

02:34.255 --> 02:35.656
a NASA enterprise
than a home improvement project.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.591
Well, to maximize
efficiency

02:37.625 --> 02:39.427
of the solar panels,

02:39.460 --> 02:42.330
we would mount them at the
same angle as our latitude.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.199
That way, they're parallel
to the Earth's axis.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.235
But we're thinking
about mechanizing

02:47.268 --> 02:50.271
the mounts,
so they follow the sun--

02:50.304 --> 02:52.306
a "sunflower system."

02:52.340 --> 02:53.307
(dinging)

02:53.341 --> 02:55.343
And--
What's this here?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.378
ALAN: Ah, now this-- we're
converting the furnace

02:57.411 --> 03:01.249
to burn renewable biomass
fuel-- uh, corn pellets.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.250
Uh, what?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.218
It's low-emission,

03:04.252 --> 03:06.220
- 80% efficient.
- Huh?

03:06.254 --> 03:08.722
It... kind of looks like a silo.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.391
It's a cylindrical granary,

03:10.424 --> 03:11.659
you know, to store
the corn.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.628
Uh, where are you planning on
putting it-- in our backyard?

03:14.662 --> 03:16.464
Yes, I was hoping
that you would help me

03:16.497 --> 03:18.299
with a geo-survey
of the site plan.

03:18.332 --> 03:20.401
Dad, you realize
this thing is 20 feet tall?

03:20.434 --> 03:23.271
No, 21.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.705
Hey, Larry,
I thought

03:24.738 --> 03:26.940
you were at the monastery.

03:26.974 --> 03:30.244
Uh, yeah, I was.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.645
There was a bit
of an altercation.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.881
He, um,
punched out Brother Theo--

03:33.914 --> 03:35.716
something
about bringing beer in.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.486
Since when
do you drink beer?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.454
Since when do you
punch people out?

03:40.488 --> 03:42.956
As recent events in Lhasa
have amply demonstrated,

03:42.990 --> 03:46.894
Buddhist monks are well-versed
in the art of violent protest.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.804
ROBIN:
That was nice.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.572
DON:
Mm-hmm.

03:58.606 --> 04:00.808
- Want to go for round two?
- Mm-hmm.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.313
(cell phone pulsing)

04:06.747 --> 04:08.716
Don't.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.320
- Don't.
- I got no choice.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.855
I'll make it
worth your while.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.892
Hey, Liz.

04:18.926 --> 04:19.960
LIZ (over phone):
Hey.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.296
Uh, I got a home invasion--
family in Torrance.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.365
I think you're gonna want
to see this for yourself.

04:24.398 --> 04:27.034
All right...
I'll be there in 30.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.035
All right?

04:28.068 --> 04:29.937
Okay.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.372
(groans)

04:31.405 --> 04:34.274
I got to go.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.312
I thought Liz was
working Narcotics.

04:38.346 --> 04:41.949
We're, uh, we're shorthanded,
so I called her back.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.352
Now she's calling you.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.853
Still number one
on her speed dial.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.322
Aw, come on, don't do that;
it's not like that.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.256
Yeah?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.492
Then why are you putting
on a clean shirt?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.398
(siren wailing)

04:57.431 --> 04:59.500
LIZ: So, we got a home invasion
an hour ago.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.734
COLBY:
Robbery?

05:00.768 --> 05:02.035
LIZ: Abduction-- the owner of
the house

05:02.069 --> 05:03.504
and his 20-year-old daughter.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.873
The victim's name
is Clay Porter.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.074
Porter, like
the guy we liked

05:07.107 --> 05:08.709
for the double homicide
six months ago?

05:08.742 --> 05:09.943
Yeah, the ex-Marine.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.380
Blew away two serial killers
that murdered his girlfriend.

05:12.413 --> 05:13.614
Right, we thought
he was in Mexico.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.748
Yeah.

05:14.782 --> 05:18.118
Guy grabbed up tonight
is Clay Porter Sr.-- his dad.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.120
Now, the neighbors described
three men, white van.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.891
Got away clean,
but they did make one mistake.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.093
- Which is?
- Left a witness.

05:26.126 --> 05:31.365
Hey, Jenna, this is Agent
Eppes and Agent Granger.

05:31.399 --> 05:32.766
- Hey, Jenna, how you doing?
- Okay.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.067
You can call me Don, okay?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.370
It all happened
so fast.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.104
I was in the kitchen.

05:37.137 --> 05:38.105
I heard them.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.540
I wanted to call,

05:39.573 --> 05:41.475
get help, do something.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.377
I was just so scared.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.012
Yeah, I'm sure
it was really scary.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.881
But if you could just, you
know, help us out a little bit,

05:47.915 --> 05:50.884
tell us what you saw,
maybe what you heard...

05:50.918 --> 05:51.919
I saw them.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.020
Who?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.888
The one who was
giving the orders,

05:54.922 --> 05:56.156
he stayed in
the living room,

05:56.189 --> 05:58.526
but the other two-- I saw them.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.728
You saw their faces?

06:00.761 --> 06:02.596
I know them;
I recognized them

06:02.630 --> 06:04.432
from pictures
of my brother's squad.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.934
He e-mailed them
back from Iraq.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.101
Jenna, are you saying

06:08.135 --> 06:10.404
that the men who did this
were Marines?

06:21.715 --> 06:24.117
DAVID: Marine Privates James
Pinkney and Carlos Ruiz.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.553
Both served in
Clay Porter's unit,

06:25.586 --> 06:27.154
both were on leave

06:27.187 --> 06:29.923
till yesterday,
when they went AWOL.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.560
This is Marine Captain Ryan
Ferraro, unit squad leader.

06:32.593 --> 06:33.594
He was shipped back

06:33.627 --> 06:35.028
three months ago
to serve trial.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.564
- For?
- Torture

06:36.597 --> 06:38.632
and murder of an Iraqi detainee.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.868
He was busted out of
the brig yesterday

06:40.901 --> 06:43.036
with the help of Carlos Ruiz
and James Pinkney.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.038
How do you figure--
fugitives, right?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.841
I mean, what are they going
after Porter's family for?

06:47.875 --> 06:48.909
Try revenge.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.445
Porter was the guy
who blew the whistle on Ferraro.

06:51.479 --> 06:52.680
Porter's been hiding out
in Mexico.

06:52.713 --> 06:55.082
I mean, the best way to get
at him is to get to his family.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.818
Looks like Ferraro
already contacted him.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.787
He crossed the border
five hours ago.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.856
Used a fake I.D.,
already ditched the truck.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.658
DAVID: He has to know we're
looking for him.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.059
He shot two men
six months ago,

07:06.093 --> 07:07.795
executed them in cold blood.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.097
And now these guys have
his family?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.532
This is going to be a war.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.833
LIZ:
Ferraro faked

07:12.866 --> 07:14.868
a heart attack
to get out of the brig.

07:14.902 --> 07:15.803
En route to
the hospital,

07:15.836 --> 07:17.938
Pinkney and Ruiz hijacked
the transport,

07:17.971 --> 07:19.640
overpowered the guards.

07:19.673 --> 07:20.641
And just drove away?

07:20.674 --> 07:23.076
No, they flew; they were
picked up in a chopper,

07:23.110 --> 07:24.712
but the guards
couldn't I.D. the pilot.

07:24.745 --> 07:27.114
Doctors say the fake heart
attack was induced by meds,

07:27.147 --> 07:29.550
so someone sneaked them
to Ferraro in the brig.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.051
Well, check that
visitors' log, right?

07:31.084 --> 07:33.186
Yes. The guy has a wife
who lives nearby,

07:33.220 --> 07:34.354
so we'll start there.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.590
This whole thing-- the brig
break, the home invasion--

07:36.624 --> 07:38.258
they have a real
military op feel to me.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.494
I mean, these Marine Force
Recon guys operate

07:40.528 --> 07:41.829
out of a specific playbook.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.096
Okay, so you're thinking

07:43.130 --> 07:46.066
that if Ferraro and Porter are
trained to act in certain ways,

07:46.099 --> 07:48.736
maybe we'll be able to predict
what their next moves will be.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.904
Yeah, maybe Charlie can
slap it into one of those

07:50.938 --> 07:54.575
algorithmic, geo-profiling,
hot zone, hot pocket deals.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.911
Put it just like that
when you ask him.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.113
CHARLIE: I got your message
about creating a model

08:00.147 --> 08:04.084
for how two forces engage
on a field of battle.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.621
Someone's already done
that work.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.257
"Observe. Orient. Decide. Act."

08:10.290 --> 08:11.892
An OODA loop.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.827
Yeah, it was developed
by a military strategist

08:13.861 --> 08:16.063
to refine the art
of aerial combat.

08:16.096 --> 08:18.131
I'm strictly a ground guy.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.266
It'll work there, too.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.100
It's really
quite simple.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.935
To defeat an enemy,
one must confine

08:21.969 --> 08:24.037
one's decision-making
to a cycle:

08:24.071 --> 08:28.275
observe, orient,
decide, act-- OODA.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.011
Uh, think of it like...

08:31.044 --> 08:32.813
like a basketball game.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.147
Each team observes
their opponents,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.950
assesses their skills,
their tendencies.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.151
Let's say
a player on offense notices

08:38.185 --> 08:40.320
that a player on defense
is weaker to her left,

08:40.353 --> 08:43.757
so she head-fakes right,
crosses over,

08:43.791 --> 08:45.092
takes the ball to the hole.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.661
Next time downcourt,
the defender has learned.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.797
She counters,
but remember, it's a cycle,

08:49.830 --> 08:52.199
so the player on offense adds
a spin move,

08:52.232 --> 08:54.034
takes the ball
to the hole again.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.037
That cycle, repeated over
and over, makes the game.

08:57.070 --> 09:00.908
Things aren't so clean
in combat.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.613
These are the best
I could find.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.947
These are great.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.081
We'll do
everything we can

09:08.115 --> 09:09.249
to find your sister
and your dad.

09:09.282 --> 09:10.584
And my brother?

09:10.618 --> 09:12.986
Same goes for him.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.789
But he'll have to face charges
when we find him.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.625
Lock him up for all I care.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.759
Clay's a murderer.

09:18.792 --> 09:22.229
I don't care
if I never see him.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.098
WOMAN:
I haven't even talked

09:25.132 --> 09:28.135
to my husband, much less
visited him in the brig.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.302
He's been back
almost three months.

09:29.336 --> 09:30.437
You think
I don't know that?

09:30.470 --> 09:33.741
Look, things between Ryan
and me haven't been great,

09:33.774 --> 09:36.343
not since the end
of his first tour.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.947
He believed in Iraq.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.214
So what happened?

09:41.248 --> 09:43.150
When he got home
that first time,

09:43.183 --> 09:44.852
I knew something was off.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.620
I just didn't know
how bad.

09:46.654 --> 09:49.322
He started drinking,
got aggressive, abusive.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.292
Think Ryan would try
to contact you?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.961
Last contact we had

09:53.994 --> 09:56.196
was my lawyer
sending him divorce papers.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.667
Well, I mean,

09:59.700 --> 10:01.301
at least we're making progress
on the silo.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.171
Sorry, uh, granary.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.273
Can we focus on the case,
please?

10:06.306 --> 10:07.941
That was
a general invitation.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.343
Larry?

10:12.846 --> 10:15.015
I'm sorry.

10:15.048 --> 10:15.916
Where were we?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.118
How about we start
with where you are.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.021
Well, I mean, given
the vagueness of your question,

10:21.054 --> 10:25.158
I'd have to answer,
"Just another day in paradise."

10:25.192 --> 10:26.226
AMITA:
Oh, come on, Larry.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.295
We've been working together
for 20 hours a week

10:28.328 --> 10:30.197
on the Higgs boson project.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.765
I know something is wrong.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.300
I mean,
you were in a tailspin

10:33.333 --> 10:34.768
long before you punched out
a monk.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.171
It's the Higgs.

10:38.205 --> 10:41.041
You know, much as I
bristle at references

10:41.074 --> 10:44.878
to the "God particle,"
what if it were so?

10:44.912 --> 10:48.949
And what if, in seeing through
the mind of God, we found

10:48.982 --> 10:50.984
just another blind alley

10:51.018 --> 10:54.888
in our search
for the grand unified theory?

10:54.922 --> 10:56.323
You won't know
until you get there.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.992
That's precisely my problem.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.294
I feel like a fraud,

11:01.328 --> 11:03.897
like a man searching

11:03.931 --> 11:07.234
for that
which he hopes not even to find.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.836
You're not thinking
about resigning

11:08.869 --> 11:11.071
from the D-Zero Team, are you?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.542
We got a call from LAPD.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.445
There was a smash and grab
at a gun store last night.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.880
Description matches
Clay Porter.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.949
All right, so it's safe
to say he's armed up.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.383
Yeah, we may have
gotten a little break.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.853
We found a number for Porter
in his dad's address book.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.021
But it goes to a
prepaid cell phone,

11:28.055 --> 11:29.489
which we can't get
a GPS trace on.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.324
So what, dead end?

11:31.358 --> 11:32.425
No, not quite.

11:32.459 --> 11:35.228
We got a list of all the
incoming and outgoing calls

11:35.262 --> 11:36.363
from the service provider.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.932
And, uh, on the night that
Porter's family was taken,

11:38.966 --> 11:40.868
he received a call from another
prepaid cell phone.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.903
Ooh, that sounds like
Ferraro making contact.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.238
Yeah, the phone log shows
a series of calls back

11:45.272 --> 11:46.774
and forth between
the two numbers sent.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.108
Look, these guys are smart,

11:48.141 --> 11:50.143
they're using phones we
can't get a GPS lock on.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.112
But we can get a general
idea of their movements,

11:52.145 --> 11:53.781
within about a four-to
six-mile coverage zone,

11:53.814 --> 11:55.348
based on cell tower data.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.984
So we got Ferraro
moving north

11:57.017 --> 11:58.251
and Porter following.

11:58.285 --> 11:59.820
- So they're drawing him in.
- Yeah.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.321
You get that to Charlie?

12:01.354 --> 12:02.522
I already did.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.091
I used my OODA loop analysis

12:04.124 --> 12:07.027
to predict our players'
next moves.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.196
These are cell tower
coverage areas

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
that Ferraro
and Porter have moved

12:11.264 --> 12:12.800
through the last 14 hours.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.068
Ferraro's blue,
red's Porter.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.837
Clearly, Ferraro
is our hunter--

12:16.870 --> 12:18.405
using the hostages as bait.

12:18.438 --> 12:19.506
And Porter's the pursuer.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.942
The location of
the gun store robbery

12:21.975 --> 12:24.377
conforms with
my predictive model.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.113
He'll have to fulfill
other needs, as well.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.415
Uh, shelter--
likely using abandoned

12:28.448 --> 12:30.550
buildings to avoid
detection; provisions,

12:30.583 --> 12:33.553
like high-caloric food
requiring no preparation.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.388
Like MREs or power bars.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.925
Pop-Tarts, Ho Hos,
Sno Balls.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.259
He'll likely
move at night;

12:39.292 --> 12:40.393
24-hour
convenience stores--

12:40.427 --> 12:41.829
his way station
of choice.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.330
I've isolated

12:43.363 --> 12:45.799
these and other high-value
targets in the area.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.100
All right, let's get those
covered, huh?

12:47.134 --> 12:48.535
We're on it.

12:48.568 --> 12:51.538
Spotted Porter 20 minutes ago,

12:51.571 --> 12:52.906
didn't see him leave.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.407
Means he's still inside.

12:54.441 --> 12:55.943
Bathrooms, maybe.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.377
Change of clothes,
getting cleaned up.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.979
Oh-- hang on.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.113
I got him.

13:00.147 --> 13:02.182
All right, SWAT's
on a call-out,

13:02.215 --> 13:04.117
take 'em at least 15 minutes
to get here.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.352
No, he's checking out.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.087
I'm taking the front,
you take the back.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.263
(store entrance bell chimes)

13:21.501 --> 13:24.537
(entrance bell chimes)

13:24.571 --> 13:27.207
- Get out now.
- No problem, man.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.441
(entrance bell chimes)

13:39.519 --> 13:41.188
(bottles rattling)

13:57.905 --> 13:59.272
(timer beeping)

14:04.044 --> 14:05.112
(groaning)

14:07.647 --> 14:09.482
Porter, don't! Drop it!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.919
Drop it or I will shoot you!

14:13.386 --> 14:14.321
Hands behind your head.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.330
Did you find everything
you needed?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.531
Yeah. Did you?

14:32.472 --> 14:35.642
Bad plan using a fake I.D.
to cross the border.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.977
It's an honest mistake.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.612
My cousin's visiting,
I picked up his.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.348
The gun store,
was that an honest mistake?

14:41.381 --> 14:43.583
You find any guns on me?

14:43.616 --> 14:45.018
COLBY: You shouldn't have come
back.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.920
Not after killing two men.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.321
Two serial killers.

14:50.290 --> 14:53.460
From time to time,
God's plan gets a nudge.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.196
The rifle, photograph
of your girl...

14:56.229 --> 14:58.265
I mean, you left evidence.

14:58.298 --> 14:59.632
Rubbing our noses in it,

14:59.666 --> 15:01.969
telling us
you could do our job better.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.271
Well, a lot of people could.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.007
Clay, we're not going to let you
take the law

15:07.040 --> 15:07.674
into your own hands again.

15:07.707 --> 15:09.142
I learned the hard way.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.311
In Iraq, here at home...

15:11.344 --> 15:15.015
don't trust anyone,
except yourself.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.683
I will save my family.

15:18.351 --> 15:21.021
He's right

15:21.054 --> 15:23.023
about the serial killer murders.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.491
We got no prints,
no witnesses.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.993
We have nothing.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.660
Yeah, but this time,
we have

15:27.694 --> 15:28.996
a border violation
and assault.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.663
Let him go.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.633
- DAVID: What?!
- The guy killed two people.

15:33.666 --> 15:36.069
The lawyers are gonna just
walk him out the door.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.105
Don, do you even hear
what you're saying?

15:38.138 --> 15:39.672
Yeah. Do you?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.576
A couple of weeks ago,

15:43.610 --> 15:45.612
we're holding on to a guy
we couldn't hold,

15:45.645 --> 15:48.148
and, uh, now we're letting one
go that we can.

15:48.181 --> 15:51.051
Just having a hard
time keeping track.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.152
Just grab yourself some coffee.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.321
You guys are gonna
have a long night.

15:54.354 --> 15:56.389
Okay.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.096
Dangerous game.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.197
It's the only game we got.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.432
You know, we lock him up,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.100
and they're going to
kill his family.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.035
I get what you're doing.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.469
You're trying to save
two innocent lives

16:09.502 --> 16:11.438
by letting Porter go,
and keeping eyes on him.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.041
Bad guys lead Porter to them, he
leads us to the hostages.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.443
But come on...
baiting the hook?

16:16.476 --> 16:17.744
It's not exactly policy.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.778
Oh, you got a problem?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.248
What, you want to
file a report?

16:27.520 --> 16:28.655
Jenna.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.592
Go back to
Mexico, Clay.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.095
Let the FBI handle this.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.163
Jenna, I can't do that.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.098
No, you have to do
things your way.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.632
None of this would
have happened

16:39.666 --> 16:40.767
if you thought of us first.

16:40.800 --> 16:42.669
I am thinking of you.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.804
And Laurie, and Dad.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.739
Jenna, I'm gonna get them back.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.575
You're gonna get them killed.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.647
I know you guys are busy,
but I was just wondering

16:54.681 --> 16:55.615
how the geo-survey
was coming.

16:55.648 --> 16:59.052
Well, I've come upon
an inconvenient truth--

16:59.086 --> 17:01.054
the optimum site
for our granary,

17:01.088 --> 17:03.656
uh, is right outside
my bedroom window.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.058
Mm.

17:05.092 --> 17:06.626
I'm guessing you're not
happy about that.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.261
CHARLIE:
Given that, for over

17:08.295 --> 17:10.430
30 years, I've enjoyed
an unobstructed view

17:10.463 --> 17:12.132
of our koi pond, no.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.734
Well, you know, we all have
to sacrifice, Charlie.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.703
CHARLIE: Yeah, I understand
that, Dad, but...

17:16.736 --> 17:19.772
those koi and I have shared
so much together.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.740
You're going to share

17:20.773 --> 17:23.610
a lot more when the ice
caps start to melt.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.612
Oh, if you've got a problem
about this...

17:25.645 --> 17:26.713
You know what
my problem is, Dad?

17:26.746 --> 17:29.316
That this was my idea,
and you did not consult me.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.118
And without any consultation
there's no collaboration.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.120
Oh, I see-- you're all
for greening the planet,

17:33.153 --> 17:33.820
but not in your backyard.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.188
Says you...

17:35.222 --> 17:36.756
whose bedroom looks out
over the arbor.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.493
(door opens)

17:42.195 --> 17:43.496
That went well.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.132
(store entrance bell chimes)
COLBY: This guy leads us

17:45.165 --> 17:47.634
around all night by our nose
and brings us back here.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.102
He's just screwing with us.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.674
Porter's getting to you, huh?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.376
I don't like a guy
who thinks

17:56.409 --> 17:58.111
a Purple Heart
gives him a free pass.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.583
Thought you boys looked hungry.

18:06.686 --> 18:10.357
Tall caramel macchiato,

18:10.390 --> 18:11.824
and chocolate croissant.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.127
Do I know the way to this girl's
heart or what?

18:14.161 --> 18:15.395
You're pulling out
all the stops.

18:15.428 --> 18:15.928
That's right.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.231
So 11:00 last night,

18:18.265 --> 18:20.167
I get a call from my boss
telling me to be ready

18:20.200 --> 18:21.401
to file charges
against Clay Porter.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.236
This morning
I find out

18:23.270 --> 18:24.571
he's on the street.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.605
How's that work?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.140
A good lawyer.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.608
This isn't my first week, Don.

18:28.641 --> 18:31.544
Okay, so maybe let me
protect you on this one.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.413
I don't need your protection.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.682
Well, that's not what you said
at the Ritz.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.586
Maybe we jumped back into bed
a little too fast.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.621
All right, all right.
I'm sorry. You're right.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.923
I was out of line.
But come on, give me a break.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.658
I mean, you wouldn't grill
another agent like that.

18:45.692 --> 18:48.228
I'm not sleeping
with another agent.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.897
Okay.
I guess I got to go to work.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.365
I'll see you.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.867
Thanks for the breakfast.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.176
Don't tell me you guys
don't accept free food.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.911
I'm done playing,
Porter.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.748
The hero of
Ranger company speaks.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.450
Don't guess
you were playing

19:10.483 --> 19:11.851
when you were in Kumar
Province either, huh?

19:14.887 --> 19:16.856
I got friends, too.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.858
Access to Army files.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.693
I like to know my enemies.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.531
You read my FBI file,
as well?

19:24.564 --> 19:26.966
You're a Fed.
You wear a suit and carry a gun.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.235
That's all I need.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.978
They're gonna kill my family.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.780
If you're not part
of the solution,

19:40.813 --> 19:42.849
you're part of the problem.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.219
Force Recon taught me that.

19:46.253 --> 19:47.387
Playing the "bad war" bad-ass

19:47.420 --> 19:48.955
is not gonna get
your family back.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.758
What do you know
about "bad wars"?

19:51.791 --> 19:55.262
Chasing Bin Laden in '01 don't
compare to what's going on now.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.796
Yeah, yeah, I heard the stories.

19:56.829 --> 19:57.997
Oh, you've heard the stories.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.932
Well, talk to me
when you've seen women

19:59.966 --> 20:01.701
and children blown up
by a 50 cal.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.637
Or a school after
a mortar attack.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.274
Huh?
Or a man tortured

20:07.307 --> 20:10.410
by your own guys,
until he begs you to kill him.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.250
You fought the "bad war"
when it was good.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.815
(tire pops and hisses)

20:54.954 --> 20:57.490
Porter's in the wind, but
we I.D.'d the helo pilot

20:57.524 --> 20:58.591
that helped Ferraro's
crew escape.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.059
His name's
Jake Renner.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.361
Works at an
aviation firm.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.296
Ex-Marine,
served with Ferraro.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.898
Now, phone dumps show
Ferraro's wife

21:05.932 --> 21:08.000
called Renner the day
before the brig break.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.636
- Day after, too.
- She's in on it.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.638
We also traced calls
from Ferraro's cell

21:11.671 --> 21:12.805
to a real estate office.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.341
On the run,
with two hostages.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.343
This isn't a great time
to be buying a house.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.910
Well, get this:
it's the same office

21:17.944 --> 21:19.679
where Ferraro's wife
answers phones part-time.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.414
She's been talking
to her husband.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.482
All right, bring her in.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.016
And we got an address on the
pilot?

21:24.050 --> 21:25.084
Yep.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.420
Aviation company boss says
Renner keeps to himself,

21:27.454 --> 21:29.422
not the friendliest
guy, I guess.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.358
Door.

21:42.769 --> 21:45.972
Somebody downloaded
his files.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.007
Remind me not to fly
with this guy.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.442
(music playing in distance)
You hear that?

21:49.476 --> 21:49.942
Yeah.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.516
*

22:01.020 --> 22:03.390
Oh...

22:03.423 --> 22:05.558
Guess I don't have to
worry about that flight.

22:05.592 --> 22:08.861
(motorcycle engine starts)

22:14.667 --> 22:16.769
(engine revving)

22:16.803 --> 22:19.472
LIZ: Looks like Porter got what
he wanted.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.074
And we got another
body to prove it.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.716
MEGAN:
Jake Renner is dead.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.384
I know that you've talked
to him.

22:31.418 --> 22:32.885
Uh, Jake was a friend.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.421
I also know
you've been in contact

22:34.454 --> 22:36.122
with your husband,
and just so we're clear,

22:36.155 --> 22:37.624
you're looking
at accessory

22:37.657 --> 22:40.026
to murder,
so you'd be out

22:40.059 --> 22:41.861
when you're about 50 years old,
if you're lucky.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.866
Ryan promised me things
would be different.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.868
We'd start over.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.403
So you arranged the brig break?

22:50.437 --> 22:52.705
I paid Jake $15,000.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.707
What about
that fake heart attack?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.543
I bribed a medic, $5,000.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.177
He slipped Ryan meds
in the brig.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.078
I've been through
your bank accounts,

22:59.111 --> 23:00.747
and you don't have
that kind of money.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.782
Ryan sent it to me from Iraq.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.751
Almost $50,000.

23:04.784 --> 23:06.453
Where did Ryan get it from?

23:06.486 --> 23:07.754
I don't know, but he said

23:07.787 --> 23:09.489
that there was more
where that came from.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.957
Where is Ryan?

23:10.990 --> 23:13.426
I don't know,
we only talked once

23:13.460 --> 23:15.962
after the brig break,
when Jake wanted more money.

23:15.995 --> 23:18.130
I swear to you
that I did not know

23:18.164 --> 23:19.866
Ryan was gonna take
Clay Porter's family.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.736
M.E.'s report came back.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.605
Jake Renner was shot
and killed two nights ago.

23:25.638 --> 23:26.839
All right, so Porter
was with us.

23:26.873 --> 23:27.874
He is off the hook.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.909
Ferraro's wife said Renner
tried to hold him up

23:29.942 --> 23:32.211
for more money
after the brig break.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.514
Ferraro's answer was
a bullet to the head.

23:35.682 --> 23:36.716
AMITA:
Oh, hey, Larry.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.686
You move out
of the motel?

23:39.719 --> 23:41.688
Actually, it's Higgs boson
data from the office.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.090
I was hoping I could prevail
upon you to return it.

23:45.692 --> 23:46.893
How goes the OODA loop?

23:46.926 --> 23:48.661
It's feeling endless.

23:48.695 --> 23:49.929
After initially working,

23:49.962 --> 23:52.665
the predictive model's
gone off the tracks.

23:52.699 --> 23:53.600
Probabilities say

23:53.633 --> 23:55.768
that Ferraro would've made
his move by now,

23:55.802 --> 23:58.170
led Porter to a killing field
to take his revenge.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.573
Well, Feynman said
everything

24:00.607 --> 24:02.074
can be predicted
if you have enough facts.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.645
Yeah, well, I doubt even Feynman
would've predicted

24:05.678 --> 24:07.914
that you'd quit on your ambition
to find the Higgs.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.082
No, my ambition quit on me.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.818
CHARLIE:
That's crap, Larry.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.219
Why don't you just tell us
what's really going on?

24:13.252 --> 24:14.821
Uh, enlighten me.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.656
You're not worried that the
discovery of the Higgs

24:16.689 --> 24:17.857
will lead you down
a blind alley.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.926
Just the opposite--
you're worried that,

24:19.959 --> 24:22.895
like your supergravity theory,
like going into space,

24:22.929 --> 24:24.597
it'll end up
being exactly

24:24.631 --> 24:27.133
what you envisioned it to be,
nothing more.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.743
So, still no sign of Porter,
or Ferraro and the hostages.

24:36.776 --> 24:37.877
We arrested the medic

24:37.910 --> 24:40.212
who slipped Ferraro the meds,
but he's not talking.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.716
All right, so where's
the "I told you so"?

24:43.750 --> 24:46.152
You made the call you
thought was right.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.854
It sucks being the boss,
but you know what,

24:47.887 --> 24:48.855
it's not a democracy.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.222
Yeah, tell Robin.

24:50.256 --> 24:54.293
Women giving you trouble--
I find that hard to believe.

24:54.326 --> 24:55.862
Ha, ha.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.764
She thinks I'm hiding something.

24:57.797 --> 25:01.300
Well, you are,
aren't you?

25:01.333 --> 25:04.070
You walked a suspect
out the door.

25:04.103 --> 25:08.207
You're stonewalling her,
and she knows it.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.543
And the fact
that you're sleeping together

25:10.577 --> 25:12.912
only makes it worse.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.814
Any other agent
that burns her, it's business,

25:14.847 --> 25:16.949
you know, but with you...

25:16.983 --> 25:18.217
I don't like not being trusted.

25:19.586 --> 25:20.987
You know, and yes,
I get the irony.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.222
So what are you
gonna do about it?

25:24.791 --> 25:25.792
CHARLIE:
Hey.

25:25.825 --> 25:26.826
I think I've got something
for you.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.695
So, I've been trying
to deduct

25:28.728 --> 25:30.830
where my OODA loop went wrong,
and then I realized

25:30.863 --> 25:32.832
that the OODA loop itself
was the problem.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.934
I hate when that happens.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.571
Yeah, so I've been assuming
that the parameters of conflict

25:38.605 --> 25:41.708
between Ferraro and Porter
were established and set.

25:41.741 --> 25:42.842
One guy tries
to save his family,

25:42.875 --> 25:45.244
the other guy tries to kill him.
Seems pretty set to me.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.946
That's totally
what I thought,

25:46.979 --> 25:48.915
but then I realized
that our two players

25:48.948 --> 25:51.584
are really playing
by a different set of rules.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.720
In a basketball game,
the rules are set,

25:53.753 --> 25:56.255
but let's say the players start
creating their own rules.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.958
The offense brings the ball
down however they want,

25:58.991 --> 26:00.860
the defense grabs
and holds them.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.295
The game becomes something
entirely different.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.764
And that's what's going on here?

26:04.797 --> 26:05.898
Not to that extreme,

26:05.932 --> 26:08.768
but I was able to
identify an X-factor

26:08.801 --> 26:10.637
using statistical
decision theory.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.271
You are gonna tell us, right?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.808
Well, we've
been assuming

26:15.842 --> 26:18.177
that Ferraro wants
to kill Porter,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.012
but my analysis indicates

26:20.046 --> 26:21.914
that he actually wants
to keep him alive.

26:23.382 --> 26:24.483
Yeah, he's trying
to capture him.

26:24.516 --> 26:27.954
I... I can't tell you why,
but I can tell you where.

26:27.987 --> 26:31.858
Substituting a capture
scenario for a kill scenario,

26:31.891 --> 26:33.893
my analysis generated

26:33.926 --> 26:35.662
probable fields of battle

26:35.695 --> 26:37.263
where our two players
will likely meet up.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.935
LAPD got the call.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.136
Eyewitness saw
three guys

26:44.170 --> 26:46.205
unload a duffel bag
from the back of a van,

26:46.238 --> 26:47.339
toss it in a Dumpster.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.708
The van matched
the description

26:48.741 --> 26:50.009
of the one
at the Porter house

26:50.042 --> 26:51.944
the night
of the home invasion.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.859
MEGAN:
We got something here.

27:10.930 --> 27:12.431
I commend you
on your police work,

27:12.464 --> 27:14.934
though it's not like three guys
dumping a body

27:14.967 --> 27:16.969
in broad daylight isn't going
to draw some attention.

27:17.003 --> 27:19.138
I want to make sure
this makes the news.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.677
Maybe this will help.

27:24.711 --> 27:29.782
(crying):
Please, they're gonna kill me.

27:29.816 --> 27:32.284
The victim is identified
as Clay Porter, 53.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.454
Abducted with his daughter,
Laurie, in a home invasion...

27:35.487 --> 27:37.990
Story's not gonna change
the more times you watch it.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.859
Just keep thinking
I'm gonna find

27:39.892 --> 27:42.128
an answer somewhere
in this stack.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.730
Sure that's all
you're looking for?

27:45.331 --> 27:49.702
You know, what Porter said
about me fighting a good war...

27:49.736 --> 27:51.303
there's truth to that.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.205
When I got pulled out
of the field

27:53.239 --> 27:54.206
by military intelligence,

27:54.240 --> 27:55.842
I left a lot of guys behind.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.210
And a lot of them
went to Iraq.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.047
I read the names in the papers;
guys I knew.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.215
Heard about friends
who came home

28:03.249 --> 28:05.217
messed up physically,
messed up in the head.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.485
Where I grew up,

28:06.518 --> 28:08.821
people were messed up
by a lot of things,

28:08.855 --> 28:10.823
a lot of it
out of their control.

28:10.857 --> 28:14.193
Didn't make them any less
culpable for their actions.

28:14.226 --> 28:17.797
It's not our job
to judge why.

28:17.830 --> 28:19.999
We're cops.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.501
Our job is to assess
actions and motives,

28:22.534 --> 28:24.771
use that information
to take bad guys

28:24.804 --> 28:26.305
off the street, that's it.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.741
You really believe that?

28:28.775 --> 28:31.243
Most of the time.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.217
You got something?

28:38.250 --> 28:40.286
Actions and motives.

28:40.319 --> 28:43.389
Jake Renner, the helo pilot,
just made a down payment

28:43.422 --> 28:45.892
on a condo, bought a new car
three weeks ago.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.093
Yeah, we know
he was expecting money

28:47.126 --> 28:48.094
from the brig break, 15 grand.

28:48.127 --> 28:50.262
I think he had to be expecting
more than that.

28:51.998 --> 28:53.766
Renner and Ferraro
served together in Iraq;

28:53.800 --> 28:55.067
his wife said they
were tight.

28:55.101 --> 28:56.368
So you're thinking
if Renner was in

28:56.402 --> 28:58.838
on the brig break,
he was in on whatever score

28:58.871 --> 29:00.172
Ferraro made in Iraq.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.908
COLBY: I talked to my buddy at
the Pentagon,

29:01.941 --> 29:03.142
asked him
about the investigation

29:03.175 --> 29:05.812
of Ferraro's murder
of the Iraqi detainee.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.313
Turns out this guy
was an insurgent

29:07.346 --> 29:10.382
who hijacked $1.5 million
of reconstruction cash

29:10.416 --> 29:12.785
and hid most of it
somewhere in his village.

29:12.819 --> 29:13.920
Except for $50,000?

29:13.953 --> 29:15.287
Yeah-- the money Ferraro
found on him

29:15.321 --> 29:17.389
when he picked him up in a
sweep.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.124
Right, which the wife got.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.091
Now, Ferraro tortured
this guy

29:19.125 --> 29:20.993
for two days straight
trying to figure out

29:21.027 --> 29:22.361
where he hid the
rest of it.

29:22.394 --> 29:23.830
After two days,

29:23.863 --> 29:25.131
he died
while under guard,

29:25.164 --> 29:27.066
but the guard was Clay Porter.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.236
Okay, so Ferraro thinks

29:30.269 --> 29:31.871
that maybe the Iraqi

29:31.904 --> 29:34.240
told Porter
where the money was

29:34.273 --> 29:36.175
as, like, a last-ditch effort
to save his freedom?

29:36.208 --> 29:38.044
Yeah, maybe he did,
and Porter's just sitting

29:38.077 --> 29:39.011
on a pile of cash.

29:39.045 --> 29:40.947
Okay, well, then that makes
a lot more sense

29:40.980 --> 29:41.848
why he wants Porter alive.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.382
Right, he needed him
to get the money.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.121
All right, get out of the way,
get out of the way!

29:50.322 --> 29:52.358
Hold it right there, Porter.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.294
One more step, I'm gonna put
a bullet right through you.

29:56.428 --> 30:00.900
I want to see... my father.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.878
The man did one dishonest thing
his whole life.

30:15.882 --> 30:18.284
At age 17, he forged
his mother's signature

30:18.317 --> 30:22.288
to join the Marines.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.991
He did a tour in Vietnam.

30:27.960 --> 30:29.896
When I got back from Iraq,
he was the only one

30:29.929 --> 30:35.167
that never asked me...
how I was.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.137
Because he knew.

30:39.906 --> 30:42.875
Look, Clay, you're gonna
have to talk to us.

30:42.909 --> 30:46.845
Why don't you start
with the $1.5 million?

30:48.047 --> 30:49.381
I didn't know
anything about it

30:49.415 --> 30:51.317
until Ferraro called me
in Mexico...

30:52.418 --> 30:54.220
...told me he
had my family,

30:54.253 --> 30:56.222
told me he wanted his money.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.489
MEGAN:
You just played along

30:57.523 --> 30:58.958
to keep your family alive?

31:05.664 --> 31:07.366
I have to get my sister back.

31:09.635 --> 31:12.939
You want my confession
on dinging those serial killers,

31:12.972 --> 31:17.043
I'll give it to you
after Laurie is home safe.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.045
All right, well,
no promises, I mean,

31:19.078 --> 31:21.413
you're gonna have to take
whatever they offer you.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.515
All I care about is Laurie.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.418
Clay, whatever happens,

31:26.452 --> 31:28.955
I love you.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.457
I brought you your
dad back in a body bag.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.959
She's next.

31:32.992 --> 31:35.027
You've got 24 hours.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.963
This is the last
message they sent.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.998
When we dug out
the background audio,

31:39.031 --> 31:40.666
we found something.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.602
(computer beeps)

31:43.635 --> 31:46.305
(low rumble)

31:46.338 --> 31:48.440
It sounds like a jet.

31:48.474 --> 31:50.009
Yeah, our techs agree.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.244
Now, we found flyovers
on all the recordings,

31:52.278 --> 31:54.213
but that's all we found.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.282
Okay... if they're
near a flight path,

31:56.315 --> 31:58.317
we may be able
to identify it

31:58.350 --> 32:01.053
using an integrated
noise model.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.722
Think of it like a geologist

32:03.755 --> 32:07.994
measuring a crater to determine
what kind of object created it.

32:08.027 --> 32:11.363
The geologist analyzes
diameter, depth, contours,

32:11.397 --> 32:13.565
to determine
how large an object,

32:13.599 --> 32:16.235
at what speed,
made that impact.

32:16.268 --> 32:20.539
In the same way,
we can analyze a sonic crater

32:20.572 --> 32:21.640
created by a plane

32:21.673 --> 32:25.277
to determine its size,
its speed, and its distance

32:25.311 --> 32:27.646
from an observer's
location.

32:27.679 --> 32:28.914
AMITA: If we can match the
flyover

32:28.947 --> 32:32.118
patterns with the available FAA
data, we can find your house.

32:32.151 --> 32:34.186
That sounds great.
I'll leave you guys to it.

32:35.521 --> 32:36.655
Thanks, Charlie.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.459
Sonic craters--
interesting choice.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.094
A crater

32:42.128 --> 32:45.031
tells a creation story--
its own big bang.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.698
And to discover
why we're here,

32:46.732 --> 32:49.135
to discover the
key that unlocks

32:49.168 --> 32:51.637
the mystery of the universe--

32:51.670 --> 32:55.341
well, the end is really
just the beginning.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.508
Sounds like you're ready

32:56.542 --> 32:58.577
to get back
in the Higgs boson saddle.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.747
A less appealing analogy,

33:01.780 --> 33:04.316
but it's accurate nonetheless.

33:09.388 --> 33:13.059
Okay... I'm the one
who let Porter go.

33:13.092 --> 33:16.595
Two lives were at stake,
and I rolled the dice.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.364
And the law be damned.

33:20.632 --> 33:23.102
I've always said
the law's overrated.

33:23.135 --> 33:27.273
I'm glad you see it that way,
'cause I need something.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.807
Let me guess.

33:28.840 --> 33:31.610
Porter's asking for a plea deal
in exchange for cooperation.

33:31.643 --> 33:32.711
No. I'm asking.

33:32.744 --> 33:35.047
For a law and order guy,
you've got a bleeding heart.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.116
Don't worry about it.
It's just one time.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.584
Double homicide,
signed confession.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.319
It's not gonna be easy,

33:40.352 --> 33:42.821
but the evidence
is circumstantial.

33:42.854 --> 33:47.293
I could make a case for
coerced confession,

33:47.326 --> 33:49.628
add mitigation for
exemplary military service.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.263
It's worth a shot.

33:51.297 --> 33:54.333
I like it. Remind me to hire you
if I ever kill anyone.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.767
I'm a prosecutor.

33:55.801 --> 33:56.802
Oh, yeah.

33:56.835 --> 33:59.071
Listen, Don...

33:59.105 --> 34:00.239
Wait-- actually,
let me just say,

34:00.272 --> 34:01.640
I mean, in terms of us,

34:01.673 --> 34:03.075
I'm there.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.543
I'm ready to step up.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.714
Yeah?

34:08.747 --> 34:09.815
Yeah.

34:12.718 --> 34:14.786
Okay.

34:16.555 --> 34:17.823
So Charlie got us
a location.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.658
It's a house in an area

34:19.691 --> 34:21.560
of condemned properties
in Westchester.

34:21.593 --> 34:23.095
Uh-huh. SWAT?

34:23.129 --> 34:25.331
Yeah, already
made the call.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.465
I want in, Eppes.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.101
What, are you kidding?

34:29.135 --> 34:30.836
Hey, I'm not looking
at this emotionally.

34:30.869 --> 34:31.870
Okay. No,

34:31.903 --> 34:33.205
I'm looking at this tactically.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.005
You need me.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.307
Now, Ferraro chose
this location

34:35.341 --> 34:36.475
because it's isolated.

34:36.508 --> 34:37.876
He can establish
a field of fire

34:37.909 --> 34:39.178
in every direction.

34:39.211 --> 34:41.247
You come up
any of these roads,

34:41.280 --> 34:43.349
and he'll cut you down
within 1,000 yards.

34:45.251 --> 34:46.118
And my sister will die.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.453
So, what would your plan be?

34:47.486 --> 34:49.221
I call him, I
set up a meet.

34:49.255 --> 34:51.223
You let me be the first face
Ferraro sees,

34:51.257 --> 34:53.259
and maybe Laurie
will have a chance.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.895
Just one minute.
That's all I'm asking.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.730
You used me
as bait once.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.366
I just want you to do it again.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.869
He's right, Don.

35:03.902 --> 35:05.271
It's the best play.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.338
Tactically.

35:08.940 --> 35:11.810
No gun.

35:11.843 --> 35:12.878
Didn't ask for one.

35:18.184 --> 35:19.751
We got a motorcycle approaching.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.555
He's alone.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.563
Greet him.

35:51.850 --> 35:52.551
He's clean.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.819
(from inside):
Bring him in.

36:02.361 --> 36:03.595
Throw him in the chair.

36:06.965 --> 36:09.268
Handcuff him.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.503
FERRARO: I was starting to
wonder if you were gonna show.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.405
- I'm here.
- That's what you wanted.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.740
I want my money.

36:14.773 --> 36:17.343
Let Laurie go,
and I'll take you to it.

36:27.819 --> 36:29.921
At first, I didn't get
why you ratted me out.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.623
Then it all came clear.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.426
That dirt bag
I beat the crap out of--

36:34.460 --> 36:36.662
he gave it up to you.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.730
You should have
brought the money, Clay.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.905
All right, boys.
Let's go. Let's roll.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.007
Let's do it.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.309
(over radio):
Squad One rolling.

36:50.342 --> 36:52.378
(tires squealing)

36:52.411 --> 36:55.947
As soon as my sister walks,
we'll get down to business.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.683
You're not in a position
to bargain.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.218
Your dad made that mistake.

37:02.921 --> 37:04.590
(tires squealing)

37:05.624 --> 37:06.792
We got incoming.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.560
Cops.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.301
Let's go! Let's go!
Liz-- might be in the back.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.302
LIZ:
Copy that.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.003
Dumb move, Clay.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.609
(gun cocks)
You just got you

37:23.642 --> 37:24.510
and your sister killed.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.747
FBI!

37:28.780 --> 37:30.015
(gunfire)

37:31.950 --> 37:33.919
FBI! FBI!

37:33.952 --> 37:34.920
Drop it!

37:34.953 --> 37:36.288
I don't think so, man.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.657
Drop the gun! Put it down!

37:38.690 --> 37:39.525
We were just about
to take a walk.

37:39.558 --> 37:40.926
You're not going anywhere.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.429
Busted out of a Marine brig.
I'll find a way out.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.597
You're not walking out of here
with a hostage-- you hear me?

37:45.631 --> 37:48.033
- Take the shot, Eppes.
- Nice try, Clay.

37:52.338 --> 37:53.539
(Ferraro groaning)

37:53.572 --> 37:55.307
Clay, put the gun down.

37:55.341 --> 37:56.308
Clay! Clay! Put it down!

37:56.342 --> 37:57.976
This man killed my father.

37:58.009 --> 38:00.446
- Put it down! Put it down!
- I'm going to prison anyway.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.514
Your only chance of walking out
of here is to drop it.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.015
COLBY:
Don't do it, man.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.484
This guy's not worth it.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.485
(panting)

38:10.456 --> 38:11.390
I'll see you in Leavenworth.

38:11.423 --> 38:13.959
(Ferraro groaning)

38:15.093 --> 38:16.528
(grunts)

38:16.562 --> 38:18.296
That's so I can hear you coming.

38:40.752 --> 38:42.654
*

38:45.657 --> 38:47.559
(crying quietly)

38:52.030 --> 38:53.932
He stopped running.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.870
Yeah.

38:58.904 --> 39:00.806
We all have to sometime.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.752
Oh, uh, I guess I should have
bought another steak.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.053
I'm just here
for another consult.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.388
CHARLIE:
We've been looking at

39:16.422 --> 39:17.689
the furnace conversion, Dad,

39:17.723 --> 39:20.025
and, uh, we think
we have another idea.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.393
WALDIE:
A cleaner burning idea.

39:21.427 --> 39:24.763
Using second
generation biofuels

39:24.796 --> 39:26.865
made from
genetically modified algae.

39:26.898 --> 39:31.102
You want me to put a log
of pond scum on the fire?

39:31.136 --> 39:32.871
Well, it's better
for the planet, Alan.

39:32.904 --> 39:35.140
I see.

39:35.173 --> 39:38.109
Uh, guess
we don't need a silo, then, huh?

39:38.143 --> 39:41.747
No. Instead, we're gonna
build one of these.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.615
A windmill.

39:43.649 --> 39:46.084
Wind turbine
is the precise term.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.187
You're gonna build a windmill--
wind turbine-- in our backyard?

39:49.220 --> 39:50.622
WALDIE:
Generates 1,000 watts

39:50.656 --> 39:52.691
in an 11 meter-per-second wind.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.694
That's, uh,
five kilowatt hours a day, easy.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.497
Good-bye, grid.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.202
A bit of an eyesore,
though, isn't it?

40:04.235 --> 40:05.871
For you, maybe.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.907
My recent calculations,
based on prevailing winds,

40:08.940 --> 40:11.543
put the blades right outside
of your bedroom window.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.885
Um, anyone heard from Larry?

40:19.918 --> 40:21.887
Apparently,
he's off probation.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.221
So he's back at the monastery?

40:23.254 --> 40:24.923
But tonight, he'll be
staying at his office.

40:24.956 --> 40:27.459
He mentioned something about

40:27.493 --> 40:29.828
a "ritual restoration
of peace and harmony."

40:31.563 --> 40:32.531
* I'm not in love

40:32.564 --> 40:34.600
Hmm.

40:34.633 --> 40:38.136
* I do think I have tried

40:38.169 --> 40:41.573
* It cost too much

40:41.607 --> 40:45.477
* I don't have the money
or the time *

40:45.511 --> 40:49.515
* 'Caused me to fall apart
once or twice *

40:49.548 --> 40:53.585
* It's worse can lack
the beautiful mess *

40:53.619 --> 40:57.523
* In a perfect world,
we never came *

40:57.556 --> 40:59.825
* Oh, we never left

40:59.858 --> 41:01.226
(phone ringing)

41:01.259 --> 41:04.563
* But you remember
what we were? *

41:07.699 --> 41:13.505
* Do you find out
what a kiss is for *

41:13.539 --> 41:17.709
* Right before you die?

41:17.743 --> 41:22.581
* Just like when you have
fallen *

41:22.614 --> 41:25.951
* I will be there
when you rise *

41:25.984 --> 41:30.722
* Oh, it's the most
peculiar feeling *

41:30.756 --> 41:33.725
* You don't know what's coming

41:33.759 --> 41:37.128
* After we die, oh

41:37.162 --> 41:40.932
* I will be there
when you rise *

41:40.966 --> 41:44.636
* Oh-oh, oh-oh

41:44.670 --> 41:48.306
* I will be there
when you rise *

41:48.339 --> 41:51.877
* Oh-oh, oh-oh

41:51.910 --> 41:55.647
* I will be there
when you rise *

41:55.681 --> 41:57.849
* In all kinds of weather

41:57.883 --> 42:03.622
* Oh, I will be there
when you rise *

42:03.655 --> 42:06.958
* Just like when you were
fallen down *

42:06.992 --> 42:11.296
* I will be there
when you rise. *
