Been woking so hard

00:44.176 --> 00:46.581
I'm punching my card

Eight hours for what?

00:49.716 --> 00:51.753
Oh, tell me what I got

00:51.919 --> 00:54.591
I've got this feeling

00:54.755 --> 00:58.562
That time'sjust holding me down

01:03.397 --> 01:06.069
I'll hit the ceiling

01:06.233 --> 01:10.408
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I got to cut loose

02:10.937 --> 02:12.472
Hey, Robert!

02:12.639 --> 02:15.811
Yeah!

02:15.976 --> 02:18.581
Bomont High, where are you at now?

02:21.082 --> 02:23.119
- I'm not kidding.
- They did not!

02:23.283 --> 02:25.821
- Yes, they did.
- They did not.

02:25.987 --> 02:27.189
We going to Mama's?

02:27.354 --> 02:31.362
We're about to get real wild tonight,
y'all! Come on!

02:36.798 --> 02:40.437
- Ron, where we going tomorrow?
- We're going to Mama Cannon's.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.974
I'm sorry, guys.
Suzy gets the final call.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.009
Turn it up, turn it up!
It's the best part!

02:47.177 --> 02:48.379
Louder, Bobby!

03:12.069 --> 03:15.209
Dispatch, stand by. I've got the
driver here. License and registration.

03:15.372 --> 03:18.077
- Step forward for me, please, sir.
- All right.

03:21.179 --> 03:23.517
He is testing us.

03:25.218 --> 03:27.522
Our Lord is testing us.

03:29.222 --> 03:31.426
Especially now...

03:31.590 --> 03:34.897
...when we are consumed with despair.

03:35.327 --> 03:40.337
When we are asking our God
why this had to happen.

03:43.170 --> 03:47.244
No parent should ever have to
know the horror

03:47.406 --> 03:49.844
of burying their own child.

03:51.179 --> 03:53.416
And yet...

03:53.580 --> 03:57.855
...five of Bomont's brightest
have lost their lives.

03:59.286 --> 04:01.758
Among them, my only son.

04:03.458 --> 04:06.530
My boy. Bobby.

04:12.101 --> 04:15.240
We have other children
to raise here in Bomont.

04:16.904 --> 04:19.945
And one day, they will
no longer be in our...

04:20.110 --> 04:24.051
...embrace and in our care.

04:24.214 --> 04:26.786
They will belong to the world.

04:26.950 --> 04:31.426
A world filled
with evil and temptation...

04:33.291 --> 04:35.061
...and danger.

04:37.662 --> 04:41.101
But until that day,
they are ours to protect.

04:41.265 --> 04:46.476
That is the lesson to be taken
from this tragedy. That is our test.

04:51.143 --> 04:55.352
We cannot be missing
from our children's lives.

05:12.266 --> 05:17.542
The following measures will be read
and voted on accordingly.

05:17.705 --> 05:22.113
A cu_ew for minors under the age of 18
will take effect immediately.

05:22.277 --> 05:25.616
Minors must be home
by ten p. m. on weeknights,

05:25.779 --> 05:28.518
11 p. m. on weekends.
All in favor, say "Aye. "

05:28.682 --> 05:31.989
- Aye.
- Opposed.

05:32.153 --> 05:33.288
Motion carries.

05:33.455 --> 05:36.327
Punitive measures will be taken
against any individual,

05:36.491 --> 05:39.463
group or property owner who organizes
a public gathering

05:39.627 --> 05:42.632
where minors engage in
inappropriate activities.

05:42.798 --> 05:46.839
Such activities include consumption
of alcohol or unlamul drugs,

05:47.002 --> 05:49.640
listening to vulgar or demeaning
amplified music,

05:49.805 --> 05:53.847
or participating in lewd
or lascivious dancing.

05:54.010 --> 05:56.481
- All in favor, say "Aye. "
- Aye.

05:56.646 --> 05:57.914
Motion carried.

05:58.081 --> 06:01.655
There will be no public displays of
dancing unless supervised as part of

06:01.818 --> 06:04.423
a school, civic or
church-related function.

06:04.588 --> 06:07.026
Outside of these
authorized institutions,

06:07.191 --> 06:11.198
public dancing among Bomont's minors
will be in violation of the law.

06:11.362 --> 06:14.402
- All in favor, say "Aye. "
- Aye.

06:14.565 --> 06:19.741
Reverend? Your vote, please.

06:22.507 --> 06:26.616
- Aye.
- Opposed. Motion carried.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.302
This is my car.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.209
Momma, it's Ren! He's here!

07:55.374 --> 07:57.010
I'm gonna beat you!

07:58.711 --> 08:01.450
Hey, girls. How you doing?

08:01.614 --> 08:03.150
You guys are huge!

08:03.316 --> 08:06.355
- Get off of me! Attack of the cousins!
- Who'd you find, Amy?

08:07.787 --> 08:11.126
- Hey, darling.
- Hey, how you doing?

08:11.291 --> 08:14.231
Good. Hope you got some
sleep on that bus.

08:14.395 --> 08:16.298
Yeah, I got plenty of sleep.
No worries, Lulu.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.634
- Hey, boy.
- Wesley.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.434
You used to call me Uncky Wes.

08:20.635 --> 08:22.437
You too big in the britches
for that now?

08:22.603 --> 08:24.673
- Is anybody hungry?
- I'm hungry! I'm hungry!

08:24.839 --> 08:28.613
- Sounds good. Need a hand with that?
- I got it, thanks.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.049
Hey Ren, I wanna tell you a ioke.
How do you make a tissue dance?

08:32.214 --> 08:33.984
Put a little boogie in it.

08:35.417 --> 08:37.855
Hey, buddy, I tell you about
these baked beans?

08:38.020 --> 08:40.325
Your great grandma Esther,
who you didn't know.

08:40.490 --> 08:41.924
This is her secret recipe.

08:42.091 --> 08:44.094
Yeah, you know what
the secret ingredient is?

08:44.260 --> 08:45.528
Bourbon.

08:45.694 --> 08:48.500
It's not bourbon. It's a ton of butter.

08:48.665 --> 08:52.104
- That's code for bourbon.
- Now, we do burgers on Saturdays.

08:52.269 --> 08:55.775
I didn't know if you were a vegetarian,
or a vegan or something?

08:55.940 --> 08:58.077
No, no, no, this is great, it's good.
Thank you.

08:58.242 --> 08:59.845
- It's grass-fed beef.
- Thank you.

09:00.010 --> 09:01.011
With a bit of possum.

09:01.178 --> 09:03.750
- OK. Whose turn is it?
- Daddy's!

09:03.914 --> 09:07.554
Let's ioin hands. Bow your heads.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.927
Most gracious heavenly Father,
we ask you to bless this food,

09:12.090 --> 09:16.399
nourishment of our body and
greater strength for Thy good.

09:16.562 --> 09:19.401
Help us be ever mindful
of the needs of others.

09:19.565 --> 09:21.468
- Amen!
- Amen.

09:23.603 --> 09:26.876
This used to be my office,
but Lulu fixed her up for you.

09:27.039 --> 09:30.613
It's got all the essentials...
water, power, bed.

09:33.779 --> 09:38.789
Look, I appreciate what you've
done here. Taking me in and all.

09:40.787 --> 09:45.095
There, at the end, the money
you sent us... It really helped.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.865
I wish I could have done more.

09:49.063 --> 09:52.870
Now, look... there's rules in my house.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.605
They're not written down,
they're just common sense.

09:55.770 --> 10:00.981
Do your schoolwork. Don't stay out late,
that's not just my rule, that's the law.

10:01.143 --> 10:05.084
And don't give people attitude.
This ain't Boston.

10:05.214 --> 10:07.217
I really want to
pull my own weight around here...

10:07.416 --> 10:10.088
Cooking meals, getting work,
helping out.

10:10.252 --> 10:13.692
My buddy, Andy Beamis runs
a cotton gin up on Chulahoma.

10:13.856 --> 10:15.759
He said you can start
in the middle of next week.

10:15.925 --> 10:17.560
Couldn't I work at the car lot with you?

10:17.761 --> 10:20.566
I'm good with engines, oil changes.
That's how I made money back home.

10:20.764 --> 10:25.473
In this economy, that's the best I got.
I suggest you learn to love it.

10:25.636 --> 10:27.139
Come on.

10:28.873 --> 10:30.442
How am I supposed to
get to work and school?

10:30.608 --> 10:32.679
You got subways out here in Mayberry?

10:32.843 --> 10:35.013
There's that Yankee sarcasm
I've been hearing about.

10:35.179 --> 10:38.786
Wish it were funnier. OK.

10:38.949 --> 10:42.723
You say you're good with engines?
I'll make you a deal.

10:42.888 --> 10:46.895
If you can get this baby running,
she's all yours.

10:49.795 --> 10:53.836
- This?
- That's a bad-ass car, boy.

10:55.668 --> 10:57.873
OK, OK. The door sticks.

10:58.037 --> 11:01.243
And the gas pedal's missing.
A couple of the, uh...

11:01.408 --> 11:02.877
Hey, it's a fixer-upper.

13:11.782 --> 13:14.454
He did it! He did it!

13:17.855 --> 13:20.193
Have a safe trip!

13:37.710 --> 13:39.847
Oh, shit!

13:57.898 --> 13:59.701
Step out of your vehicle, son.

14:01.268 --> 14:04.541
- Is there a problem, officer?
- Driver's license.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.114
Massachusetts, huh?

14:11.279 --> 14:13.016
You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

14:13.180 --> 14:16.286
You gonna throw me in iail
for playing Quiet Riot?

14:16.450 --> 14:18.220
Let's watch that attitude, son.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.022
- Yankee sarcasm.
- What was that?

14:20.187 --> 14:22.759
Nothing. Sir.

14:22.925 --> 14:26.399
- You'll have to appear in court.
- For what?

14:26.561 --> 14:28.531
Disturbing the peace.

14:31.033 --> 14:32.736
Peaceful out here, isn't it?

14:35.939 --> 14:38.979
Progress.
What does progress mean to you?

14:40.476 --> 14:42.948
We have computers in our pockets,

14:43.112 --> 14:47.053
telephones in our automobiles,
and money on a plastic card.

14:47.217 --> 14:50.723
Who here today remembers a time
when you had to go

14:50.888 --> 14:53.326
inside the bank to get your money?

14:53.490 --> 14:57.465
Remember old Mr. Rucker
down at Bomont State Bank?

14:57.629 --> 15:02.472
Every time you made a deposit, he'd
give you a piece of Bazooka gum.

15:03.468 --> 15:05.940
Now, I haven't yet met an ATM machine

15:06.104 --> 15:09.176
that would give me a piece
of Bazooka chewing gum,

15:09.341 --> 15:15.153
let alone make me feel special,
like Mr. Rucker did.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.284
Now, is that progress?

15:18.952 --> 15:20.321
Today...

15:20.486 --> 15:25.964
...more and more, as families,
we are tuning each other out.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.995
We're either su_ing on the Internet,

15:28.161 --> 15:31.333
texting on our cell phones, or
staring mindlessly at a television set.

15:32.800 --> 15:38.811
Now, if that is a portal to the world,
I want no part of it.

15:40.775 --> 15:44.884
These are the people
that we need to tune in to.

15:46.147 --> 15:48.819
Everyone in this church.

15:49.618 --> 15:52.523
- Thanks for coming today.
- Nice preaching today, Reverend.

15:52.688 --> 15:54.358
- Good to see you.
- Yes, sir, you, too.

15:54.523 --> 15:58.564
This is my sister's son, the one I was
telling you about. Ren MacCormack.

15:58.728 --> 16:01.299
- Ren, Ren, welcome to Bomont.
- How you doing?

16:01.430 --> 16:03.701
- We are so happy to have you with us.
- Thank you.

16:03.867 --> 16:06.405
I think you're gonna like
Bomont High School.

16:06.569 --> 16:09.841
In fact, if I'm not mistaken,
the graduating class this year

16:10.007 --> 16:12.511
is the biggest in the school's history.

16:12.676 --> 16:14.345
Hey, Roger! Come on over here!

16:14.511 --> 16:16.682
How many seniors
we have at Bomont High this year?

16:16.847 --> 16:21.389
- About 220, give or take a dropout.
- Roger's the school principal there.

16:21.552 --> 16:24.357
- Hello.
- Wait... Do you play football?

16:24.522 --> 16:29.031
- 'Cause we really need a good kicker.
- Ain't that a fact!

16:29.193 --> 16:32.032
But, remember, if you're gonna play
for us, you gonna have to stay clean,

16:32.197 --> 16:36.438
keep out of trouble. I heard you
already had a run-in with the law.

16:36.601 --> 16:38.037
You what?

16:38.203 --> 16:42.478
I don't know how it is up in Boston,
but down here we have rules

16:42.675 --> 16:44.244
against playing music too loud.

16:44.410 --> 16:47.616
You're kidding me.
He got popped for playing music?

16:47.780 --> 16:51.687
Ariel! I want you to meet my daughter,
she goes to Bomont.

16:51.852 --> 16:53.521
You're going to need a friend
on your first day.

16:53.687 --> 16:57.260
This is Ren MacCormack. He'll be
attending school with you tomorrow.

16:58.792 --> 17:02.366
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:02.529 --> 17:04.465
- Hey, Dad?
- Yes, honey?

17:04.631 --> 17:06.434
Rusty and I have that
science project due tomorrow,

17:06.601 --> 17:09.973
we're going to be working on it pretty
late. I was thinking I'd stay over.

17:10.137 --> 17:14.212
- Is that OK?
- On a school night? Is that necessary?

17:14.342 --> 17:17.749
Rusty! Don't you think
it's gonna take us all night?

17:17.913 --> 17:21.520
Sure. At least.

17:22.785 --> 17:27.426
- I guess it's fine, right...
- Thanks, Daddy. Bye, Mom.

17:30.994 --> 17:32.597
Come on, let's go.

17:35.765 --> 17:39.973
And with _o laps to go,
the leader is car number_,

17:40.138 --> 17:41.573
Chuck Cranston!

18:04.296 --> 18:07.001
Coming around the last turn
on the final lap...

18:07.167 --> 18:08.469
We have a winner!

18:08.634 --> 18:11.139
In the number _ car,
it's Chuck Cranston

18:11.303 --> 18:14.342
crossing the line first
for the checkered flag!

18:14.507 --> 18:16.209
Let's hear it for Chuck!

18:18.145 --> 18:20.816
Yeah! He iust won!

18:26.887 --> 18:29.057
Yeah, baby!

18:30.324 --> 18:31.459
Yeah, baby!

18:31.625 --> 18:35.132
Today's late-model division
Two-time champion, folks.

18:35.296 --> 18:38.970
Give it up for Chuck Cranston!
Way to go, Chuck!

18:39.134 --> 18:42.407
Go up there, you get that flag and
get that cute ass out here right now!

18:42.571 --> 18:43.839
Come on, now!

18:46.841 --> 18:50.181
Hey, what are you doing?
Come back here with that!

18:50.345 --> 18:53.217
- Ariel, what the hell are you doing?!
- Hammer down, baby!

18:56.485 --> 18:58.922
Oh, yeah. Come on, now.

18:59.089 --> 19:01.994
Chuck Cranston! I don't care if
your daddy does own this track,

19:02.125 --> 19:04.329
you've got to get her out of here!

19:04.493 --> 19:08.100
You can chase me down, old man.
Chase me down!

19:08.999 --> 19:11.671
Get back here! You're going to
get yourself killed out there!

19:16.373 --> 19:20.615
Once again, ladies and gentlemen, your
late-model division _o-time champion.

19:20.778 --> 19:23.082
Let's give it up for Chuck Cranston!

19:40.867 --> 19:43.806
Thanks for coming out to the
Cranston Motor Speedway.

19:43.970 --> 19:45.907
- Rusty!
- We hope you had a good time.

19:46.072 --> 19:47.240
Rusty, I'm talking to you!

19:47.407 --> 19:49.210
You know when you're watching
the news, and you see someone

19:49.342 --> 19:51.546
- get killed doing something stupid?
- God, this again?

19:51.711 --> 19:54.583
I don't want to be that stupid friend
who just stands around watching.

19:54.748 --> 19:58.055
- He should never let you do that!
- So you're just going to leave me?

20:00.121 --> 20:01.691
Me?

20:03.292 --> 20:04.794
Leave you?

20:06.128 --> 20:09.567
I don't know what's going on
with you anymore.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.470
Ever since Bobby...

20:13.635 --> 20:17.309
- I guess I'll get my own ride back.
- I guess you will.

20:43.701 --> 20:44.836
Yellow flag.

20:45.003 --> 20:46.840
Yellow flag.

20:52.510 --> 20:55.014
Baby, why we got to go so fast?

20:56.182 --> 20:58.887
You want some choirboy
to put a promise ring on your finger?

20:59.051 --> 21:00.954
You're not gonna find that with me,
preacher's daughter.

21:01.120 --> 21:04.694
Stop. I get that from everybody else.
I don't need that from you.

21:05.691 --> 21:07.694
I thought it was real simple
with you and me.

21:08.362 --> 21:09.497
Yeah?

21:10.163 --> 21:11.900
I'm your man.

21:12.065 --> 21:14.703
You're... you're my rebel child.

21:16.536 --> 21:18.673
I'm not a child.

21:25.579 --> 21:27.215
Prove it.

21:29.384 --> 21:31.221
Shut the door.

21:37.359 --> 21:39.496
Shut the door.

21:40.495 --> 21:41.764
Go on.

23:17.501 --> 23:19.638
Are you going to pout all day?

23:21.338 --> 23:23.608
Look, I already said I was sorry.

23:25.509 --> 23:28.849
It's Monday. Everybody gets a do-over.

23:29.779 --> 23:32.016
- You love me!
- I know I do!

23:48.433 --> 23:50.805
Isn't that that new kid
my mom introduced me to at church?

23:50.969 --> 23:52.806
Sure is. He's cute.

23:52.971 --> 23:56.812
- You think everybody's cute.
- I know, but I think he's cute.

24:00.313 --> 24:03.052
He dressed up for his first day
of school. That's so cute!

24:03.216 --> 24:05.486
Oh, my God, Rusty. Come on, let's go.

24:05.652 --> 24:08.423
Did you see his tie?
I like it and I'm going to tell him.

24:08.588 --> 24:10.825
- That's a nice tie.
- Rusty.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.993
Hey, I mean it!
Don't let anyone tell you different.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.262
Thanks, uh...

24:14.428 --> 24:16.933
- Rusty.
- It's Ahriel, right?

24:20.569 --> 24:21.671
It's Ariel.

24:21.835 --> 24:26.177
- Ariel.
- Very good.

25:09.320 --> 25:10.622
Hey. Watch where
you're going, little guy.

25:10.788 --> 25:12.591
- Sorry, man. I didn't see you.
- It's like driving.

25:12.757 --> 25:14.092
Stick with the
flow of traffic, numbnuts.

25:14.258 --> 25:16.663
Maybe if you weren't wearing
all that camouflage, I could see you.

25:16.828 --> 25:19.667
You should get one of them orange
vests so hunters don't shoot you.

25:19.831 --> 25:22.036
An orange vest? I don't wear orange.

25:22.234 --> 25:25.139
I'm not a Tennessee fan.
I'm a Georgia Bulldog.

25:26.338 --> 25:27.674
Where you from? You talk funny.

25:28.642 --> 25:32.149
I talk funny? I talk funny?
You should hear you from my end.

25:33.446 --> 25:34.514
I'm from Boston.

25:35.681 --> 25:37.251
Massachusetts?

25:37.417 --> 25:40.857
- It's in the United States?
- Yeah, I read that somewhere.

25:42.956 --> 25:44.426
What's up, man? I'm Willard.

25:47.628 --> 25:52.337
- I'm Ren. MacCormack.
- Nice to meet you. Let me see this.

25:53.267 --> 25:55.872
Literature and Composition.
That's this way. Follow me.

25:56.037 --> 25:57.940
People give you shit
about that tie yet?

25:58.106 --> 26:03.115
- Nah, but the day iust started.
- First group, on your mark...

26:04.346 --> 26:06.049
Keep that head down! Head down!

26:08.950 --> 26:10.553
I'm gonna smoke your butt, man.

26:10.719 --> 26:12.889
- You think so?
- I know so. Your butt's getting smoked.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.863
Come on, Willard!

26:24.568 --> 26:26.238
Go get your water.

26:26.403 --> 26:28.841
Don't gulp it down!

26:29.006 --> 26:30.743
Warm it up in your mouth.

26:30.908 --> 26:32.911
Two swallows, hit them monkey bars.

26:33.077 --> 26:36.818
- You're looking flushed, Willard.
- My cheeks are naturally ruddy, man.

26:36.980 --> 26:40.187
Ren, this is Woody, our team captain.
You don't gotta salute him.

26:40.351 --> 26:42.756
- What's up, man? Nice to meet you.
- How's it going?

26:42.921 --> 26:46.394
Last year, varsity made it to regional.
They bussed us down to Alabama.

26:46.559 --> 26:48.763
The excitement never stops.

26:48.927 --> 26:52.367
- You haven't been overseas?
- I've been to Alabama, if that counts.

26:52.531 --> 26:54.034
No. It doesn't.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.672
I went to Russia two years ago
with my gymnastics team.

26:56.836 --> 26:58.673
It's kind of a sister city
thing with Moscow.

26:58.838 --> 27:02.278
Yeah, Russia... I don't know if I
dig that. It sounds kind of boring.

27:02.442 --> 27:03.877
Do you know anything
about Russian girls?

27:04.043 --> 27:07.116
I know they range from
bearded to drop-dead beautiful.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.450
Yeah? Well, I can vouch
for the beautiful ones.

27:09.616 --> 27:10.885
Two girls from the Russian team

27:11.051 --> 27:13.523
snuck me out of my dorm room
late night. They didn't have beards.

27:13.688 --> 27:16.293
- They were smoking.
- What were they smoking?

27:17.791 --> 27:20.797
Oh, you mean, like, smokin' hot.
I'm sorry. Continue.

27:20.962 --> 27:24.368
So we go to this club.
The music's banging. It's pitch black.

27:24.533 --> 27:28.540
I couldn't see shit, iust hot two girls
drenched in sweat all over me.

27:28.704 --> 27:31.242
- We danced all night.
- Great. What'd you guys do after?

27:32.708 --> 27:35.280
Oh, come on. Look, down in the South,
you can't start a story

27:35.444 --> 27:37.414
about a threesome and not finish it.

27:38.748 --> 27:40.150
Come on.

27:41.451 --> 27:44.490
It goes without saying,
these girls are flexible.

27:44.654 --> 27:48.328
They take me into a bathroom stall.
One shoves her tongue down my throat,

27:48.491 --> 27:52.265
the other one's on top. This girl's
a champion pommel horse gymnast.

27:52.429 --> 27:56.637
I'm talking killer
upper body strength. Banging.

27:56.801 --> 27:58.604
She's scratching my back,
she's tearing my clothes off.

27:58.769 --> 28:02.009
And her friend's whispering
in my ear, "Hernnya. "

28:02.173 --> 28:04.277
- Her...
- Hernnya.

28:04.441 --> 28:06.144
- Hernnya.
- Yeah.

28:06.310 --> 28:10.185
- What does that mean?
- It's Russian for "bullshit. "

28:10.348 --> 28:11.683
Why would she say that?

28:15.822 --> 28:18.961
- 'Cause you're bullshitting me?
- Yup. Yeah.

28:19.659 --> 28:21.128
But we did dance, man.

28:22.628 --> 28:24.431
We danced our asses off.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.303
That ain't right.

28:42.115 --> 28:46.223
You ever work at a gin before?
You know about a bale press?

28:46.387 --> 28:48.624
I don't know. I've never seen one.

28:48.790 --> 28:51.863
- Where are you from?
- Boston, Mass.

28:52.026 --> 28:54.296
Did they teach you
anything useful up north?

28:54.462 --> 28:57.902
Just enough to get by. I'm hoping y'all
can teach me the three R's.

28:58.066 --> 28:59.168
Three R's?

28:59.335 --> 29:01.972
Yeah, you know...
reading, writing, redneckery.

29:05.007 --> 29:07.244
People are giving you
a hard time, I can see that.

29:07.409 --> 29:10.381
You're young, you're from out of town
and you're a smart aleck.

29:11.548 --> 29:13.050
Can you start Thursday?

29:14.885 --> 29:16.755
Yeah. Yes, sir!

29:18.722 --> 29:20.592
I'll teach you to read and write,

29:20.758 --> 29:23.429
but you're on your own
when it comes to redneckery.

29:28.932 --> 29:30.769
Yeah. Give it a little bit of gas.

29:31.870 --> 29:34.241
Yeah, that sounds good. Cut it.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.414
What's the deal with the preacher's
daughter? She worth all that attitude?

29:39.578 --> 29:41.715
I hear, back in the day,
she used to be a goody two-shoes.

29:41.880 --> 29:45.354
Now she fronts like she some hellraiser.
Wearing her jeans tight and everything.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.087
You could put a quarter
in that girl's back pocket

29:47.252 --> 29:48.788
and tell if it's heads or tails.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.857
Why? You're trying to knock boots
with her, aren't you?

29:51.023 --> 29:52.526
- No.
- Yes, you are. He is.

29:52.692 --> 29:55.631
I'm iust curious. I ain't trying to
bang her or take her ballroom dancing.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.600
Well, that'd be pretty hard,
being that that's against the law.

29:58.766 --> 30:00.870
What? Banging a preacher's daughter?

30:01.034 --> 30:02.871
No, public dancing's against the law
if you're under 18.

30:03.036 --> 30:04.706
Shut up.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.144
Wait, wait, wait. Jump back.

30:09.310 --> 30:12.115
Are you kidding me?
Dancing is against the law?

30:12.279 --> 30:14.483
Yeah, man. We got laws
up the poop chute around here.

30:14.649 --> 30:19.090
I can't even bring a bandana to school,
because they think I'm in a gang.

30:19.254 --> 30:21.558
If my face gets sweaty,
I gotta use the back of my hand.

30:21.723 --> 30:24.796
Let me tell you something,
this country was built on bandanas.

30:24.961 --> 30:27.833
So you're telling me Bomont High
doesn't have a prom.

30:27.996 --> 30:31.636
Well, you know...
They got the Fall Ball, right?

30:31.801 --> 30:34.206
OK. So, all the churches
get together and put it on.

30:34.403 --> 30:37.008
The whole town shows up
and everybody's eyes are on you

30:37.173 --> 30:39.811
to make sure you're dancing
at least six inches away from your girl.

30:39.977 --> 30:41.814
You gotta add
another two inches for me.

30:41.979 --> 30:46.421
And, for one song, they make you...
They make you dance with your mother.

30:46.550 --> 30:48.487
I mean, talk about a boner killer.

30:49.453 --> 30:51.791
And the schools don't wanna
have dances on their property.

30:51.956 --> 30:55.195
They... They say they
don't want to be held liable.

30:55.359 --> 30:57.129
They don't want to be held
liable for what?

30:57.294 --> 30:59.899
Five seniors died in a car crash
coming home from a dance,

31:00.098 --> 31:01.500
and that's when
the whole town went crazy.

31:01.666 --> 31:05.340
They started blaming it on the liquor,
the music, the dancing.

31:05.503 --> 31:08.610
After a while everybody
started thinking dancing was a sin.

31:08.774 --> 31:12.381
But we're talking about the law, right?
Not heaven and hell?

31:12.544 --> 31:16.986
Yeah, take that up with Reverend Moore.
I'm a machine, I'm a machine.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.421
Hey, what's up, dude?

31:23.490 --> 31:25.125
Hey, Woody, what's up, man?

31:26.326 --> 31:28.563
Hey, how you doing?

31:29.195 --> 31:30.530
- MacCormack.
- How you doing, buddy?

31:30.697 --> 31:33.202
- Good, man. You hungry?
- Yeah. What's good here?

31:33.366 --> 31:36.205
We got nachos, hot dogs, hamburgers.

31:36.370 --> 31:38.039
Frito pie, all the way.

31:38.205 --> 31:39.807
And if you're a real man?
You'll eat that jalapeño.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.743
- Get your fingers out of my pie!
- What about that guy?

31:41.910 --> 31:43.245
You don't know where his finger's been.

31:43.411 --> 31:46.383
Woody! Check the door, man.
Cop still here?

31:50.385 --> 31:51.854
Five-O getting his move on.

31:52.020 --> 31:55.160
- What you got for me, Uncle Claude?
- David Banner.

31:55.290 --> 31:58.429
Bootleg. Don't get too krunk out there.

31:58.593 --> 32:01.666
First sign of the police,
I'm gonna pull the plug.

32:01.831 --> 32:04.436
I don't wanna get a fine,
and you don't wanna get another ticket.

32:04.600 --> 32:09.076
- Wait. You got a ticket for dancing?
- He got two tickets for dancing.

32:09.238 --> 32:11.843
One more and he's off the team.

32:12.508 --> 32:16.383
All right. Let's get
this party started! It's on!

32:16.547 --> 32:20.054
- No cops. Let's get it, come on!
- Let's get it started!

32:21.086 --> 32:22.555
Yo! It's shomime!

32:22.719 --> 32:24.389
- It's clear!
- Let's go!

32:26.858 --> 32:28.293
Back it up, back it up, move out.

32:36.068 --> 32:37.136
Whoa.

32:55.655 --> 32:57.759
- Woody!
- Woody!

33:04.431 --> 33:05.299
Whoa!

33:06.601 --> 33:07.936
Now that's what I'm talkin' about.
That's a beautiful thing!

33:08.102 --> 33:10.807
Does that turn you on?
Girls acting like hussies?

33:10.972 --> 33:12.575
It don't suck.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.076
Oh, now, come on.

33:17.178 --> 33:19.315
Yeah, dude. They... they get into it.

33:23.318 --> 33:24.353
Hey, you. Let's go.

33:24.520 --> 33:25.990
Come on, let's dance.

33:36.799 --> 33:38.836
- Come on!
- I'm good. I don't dance.

33:39.003 --> 33:40.338
You go have fun.

33:46.544 --> 33:48.714
Me and my boys are going
to push everybody back.

33:48.879 --> 33:51.117
Let me see you do that city boy thing.

33:51.282 --> 33:52.617
C'mon! Get it!

34:43.036 --> 34:44.774
Oh, dang. Oh, dang.

34:59.722 --> 35:02.260
Claude!
Reverend Moore's out front, man.

35:13.871 --> 35:15.440
Oh, shit.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.445
You want me to step in on this?

35:26.218 --> 35:27.486
What, you can't keep up?

35:27.652 --> 35:31.494
You can put on a show for that guy.
Doesn't mean I'm gonna.

35:34.826 --> 35:37.164
Attention, attention. Ar9el Moore,

35:37.329 --> 35:39.934
will you please come up
to the front of the diner.

35:40.099 --> 35:42.436
Your daddy is here for you.

35:44.737 --> 35:46.373
She's busted!

35:54.547 --> 35:56.083
Show's over.

36:08.595 --> 36:12.804
You mother was afraid you didn't
have any money. She said you'd be here.

36:12.967 --> 36:14.670
Daddy, it's not a big deal.
We were just messing around.

36:14.836 --> 36:17.875
I think it would be best
if you came home with me.

36:18.807 --> 36:20.878
Right now.

36:24.280 --> 36:26.284
Daddy gonna
take her out to the woodshed.

36:26.415 --> 36:28.285
What the hell does that mean?

36:28.417 --> 36:30.454
It means she's in deep shit.

36:37.661 --> 36:40.233
- Hey, honey. You're home early.
- Yeah.

36:40.397 --> 36:41.766
Did you have fun?

36:43.201 --> 36:47.910
- Just breaking the law, Momma.
- Ariel. We have not finished talking.

36:49.240 --> 36:50.876
Ariel!

36:53.578 --> 36:57.585
Why do you think you're above serving
your penalty in Saturday School?

36:57.749 --> 37:00.387
I don't think I'm above anyone, sir.
I was just unaware that...

37:00.551 --> 37:02.689
Hey, Eddie? Eddie?

37:02.855 --> 37:05.860
He has a iob on Saturdays
over at Andy's cotton gin.

37:06.024 --> 37:07.994
Wes. Call me "Judge," would you?

37:08.161 --> 37:12.035
- And take your hat off.
- OK, Judge Eddie.

37:12.598 --> 37:16.238
Could you show a little mercy here?
He was playing his music too loud.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.441
About as loud as you used to
play Lynyrd Skynyrd

37:18.605 --> 37:21.277
in that old Impala
me and you used to roll in.

37:21.441 --> 37:24.046
Remember that... Judge?

37:25.678 --> 37:27.448
You'll have Andy verify his employment?

37:27.615 --> 37:29.050
- Now hold on...
- Yes I will!

37:29.216 --> 37:32.590
- Can I go back to the car lot now?
- Sentence suspended.

37:34.889 --> 37:37.261
Oh, man. Son, you're lucky.

37:37.426 --> 37:39.931
Not everyone's got this town
on lockdown like I do.

37:40.095 --> 37:42.934
Oh, yeah? Since you and the iudge
are so buddy-buddy,

37:43.098 --> 37:46.137
maybe you can have him explain this
whole ban-on-dance thing to me.

37:46.302 --> 37:48.639
Whatever happened to separation
of church and state?

37:48.804 --> 37:50.942
What's church got to do with it?

37:51.107 --> 37:53.879
It seems to have everything
to do with everything around here.

37:54.043 --> 37:55.445
Let me ask you a question.

37:55.611 --> 37:58.616
If there's a football game Sunday
and you want to buy a beer, can you?

37:58.781 --> 38:02.155
- You can't buy beer on Sundays.
- And why not?

38:02.319 --> 38:03.754
'Cause of church.

38:05.456 --> 38:09.631
You can in Boston, why not in Bomont?

38:10.627 --> 38:14.301
Look. Sunday is God's day.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.773
If you want to drink beer on God's day,
you need to buy it on beer's day,

38:17.936 --> 38:20.307
which is Saturday.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.476
It's right there in the Bible,
if you don't believe me.

38:22.640 --> 38:25.479
Separation of God and beer.

38:26.445 --> 38:30.186
And if God said it, I believe it.
That settles it! Now shut up.

38:36.856 --> 38:38.292
Hey, MacCormack.

38:44.965 --> 38:47.069
Hey, what's up... Ariel?

38:48.201 --> 38:51.173
Chuck Cranston wants to see you
at his daddy's racetrack tomorrow.

38:51.339 --> 38:55.680
- Be there at two o'clock.
- OK. What happens at two o'clock?

38:55.842 --> 38:59.316
- Show up and find out.
- And what if I don't?

39:00.114 --> 39:04.021
- You're gonna miss all the fun.
- How come he sent you to tell me?

39:06.554 --> 39:08.024
I volunteered.

39:14.029 --> 39:16.133
If that shithog tries anything,
I'm gonna pound him.

39:16.298 --> 39:18.503
- No fighting, Willard.
- No promises, Rusty.

39:19.302 --> 39:21.907
You guys, keep the smoke away
from her now. Her daddy smells that,

39:22.071 --> 39:24.976
- he'll never let her hang out again.
- High school field trip's here.

39:27.577 --> 39:29.012
Twinkle toes.

39:29.178 --> 39:32.083
Watching you the other night,
that was real entertaining.

39:32.249 --> 39:37.158
We thought we'd invite you out here.
Maybe you could put on a show for us.

39:37.321 --> 39:40.728
Chuck, didn't you hear?
He's real into gymnastics.

39:40.891 --> 39:42.461
Gymnastics.

39:44.728 --> 39:48.068
Well... I thought only fags
were into gymnastics.

39:49.034 --> 39:51.238
I thought only assholes
still used the word "fag. "

39:55.206 --> 39:56.676
Touché.

39:57.609 --> 39:59.079
Why don't you...

40:01.213 --> 40:02.348
...try dancing with this?

40:37.785 --> 40:43.496
Now... we race these buses
every weekend at the Derby Mash-up.

40:43.659 --> 40:47.332
We race them in a figure eight,
just like this.

40:48.998 --> 40:55.010
Two things you gotta worry about.
Your corners, and your intersection.

40:57.340 --> 40:59.478
You fall behind, you're gonna
get hit by the leader.

40:59.644 --> 41:03.150
You pull ahead, you iust might
get slammed by the guy in last place.

41:03.314 --> 41:06.954
What do you say, city boy?
Ready to race?

41:08.853 --> 41:11.792
I drove one of these at a pep rally
one time... it ain't easy.

41:11.956 --> 41:13.893
All right? If she flips over,
crawl out the side window.

41:14.091 --> 41:16.663
If it catches on fire, iump out of it.

41:16.827 --> 41:18.998
- Keep loose.
- Pump your brakes with your foot.

41:19.164 --> 41:20.599
Pump the brakes. Tell him.

41:20.765 --> 41:22.435
- I iust told him.
- Cool. Pump them brakes.

41:22.601 --> 41:24.872
- All right, man. Good luck.
- Whoa, whoa! Guys, guys.

41:25.037 --> 41:28.444
This is pretty dangerous, right?
We could get killed?

41:29.875 --> 41:35.286
We? What's this "we," white boy? Crazy.
We? Like I'd get my black ass up there.

41:35.415 --> 41:37.218
What'd I get myself into?

41:38.785 --> 41:43.694
How do, all you pissants? Welcome
to the Cranston Motor Speedway!

41:43.856 --> 41:47.763
Whoa, baby! You OK?
You kinda had a lot to smoke.

41:47.961 --> 41:49.698
Don't be tellin' me
when I've had enough.

41:49.863 --> 41:52.334
Looks like a lovely day for a bus...

41:52.500 --> 41:53.935
I didn't say you had enough.
I just said you had a lot.

41:54.134 --> 41:59.478
If you want to lecture somebody,
go tell Sweet Buns to start his engine.

42:01.176 --> 42:05.718
We got one practice lap
before the green flag drops, folks.

42:05.880 --> 42:10.556
It's a three-lap race to the
finish line, or the last man standing.

42:10.720 --> 42:14.694
Gentlemen, start your engines!

42:21.997 --> 42:22.998
Let's go!

42:25.768 --> 42:31.179
We've got homegrown hero
Chuck Cranston in Burn in Hell.

42:31.341 --> 42:32.944
You're in my world now, boy!

42:33.110 --> 42:35.281
On the outside, we've got the new kid

42:35.413 --> 42:38.085
racing in the Fun Zone,
Ren MacCormack.

42:38.249 --> 42:39.618
Go, Fun Zone!

42:39.783 --> 42:42.756
Caroline and Russell
are in the back of the pack, y'all.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.790
Hey! Where's the green flag?

42:44.956 --> 42:47.193
- Improvise.
- Now we're coming into turn four,

42:47.326 --> 42:49.763
- getting ready for the green flag.
- Oh, yeah!

42:49.927 --> 42:52.032
Preacher's daughter, my ass, baby!

42:53.899 --> 42:57.873
Green flag, green flag,
green flag! And... Go!

42:58.705 --> 43:00.875
Come on, Ren! Go!

43:01.574 --> 43:03.043
- Go, Ren! C'mon!
- Let's go!

43:03.209 --> 43:07.050
They're coming around turn number one.
Fun Zone is loose around the corner.

43:07.914 --> 43:09.951
Hang in there! Hang in there!

43:13.387 --> 43:16.926
Chuck Cranston takes the lead,
with Russell on his ass.

43:20.127 --> 43:23.834
Caroline and MacCormack are door to
door, they're battling for third place!

43:24.999 --> 43:26.802
You want a little smooch?

43:31.306 --> 43:32.641
She is tearing him up!

43:33.542 --> 43:35.479
Coming out of turn four.

43:35.645 --> 43:38.617
Here they come,
headed straight for the intersection!

43:39.782 --> 43:42.654
- Pump the brakes!
- Somebody better stop.

43:42.819 --> 43:45.357
Somebody better do something!

43:45.521 --> 43:47.258
- Watch out, baby!
- Shit!

43:52.261 --> 43:56.303
- Caroline is into the wall!
- Sorry, girl.

43:56.466 --> 43:59.371
Russell! You damn son of a bitch!

44:00.470 --> 44:03.375
Russell and MacCormack
are duking it out for second place.

44:14.219 --> 44:15.521
Shit!

44:16.888 --> 44:19.660
We got fireworks! God bless America!

44:20.959 --> 44:22.662
And I'm on fire.

44:22.828 --> 44:26.068
Chuck Cranston holds the lead
with one lap to go!

44:26.232 --> 44:27.400
Getting lonely up here!

44:27.566 --> 44:31.541
Oh, we've got us a regular
Mexican standoff, folks.

44:32.137 --> 44:33.673
Don't you play chicken with me, boy.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.810
Who's gonna back down?
Who's gonna back down?

44:35.976 --> 44:37.745
Somebody's got to back down.

44:37.911 --> 44:39.914
- Oh, what the hell.
- No, no, no! Damn it!

44:42.550 --> 44:46.257
Chuck is down!
MacCormack takes the lead!

44:47.688 --> 44:48.890
Yeah!

44:49.056 --> 44:50.358
Fire! He's on fire!

44:52.761 --> 44:53.762
Damn it!

44:57.566 --> 45:00.371
- I got no brakes!
- Run! Hurry!

45:00.535 --> 45:02.338
We're coming for you, Ren! Hold on!

45:03.372 --> 45:04.774
Oh, my God!

45:05.775 --> 45:07.244
Hey man, did you know
your bus is on fire?

45:07.409 --> 45:09.212
- Yeah, no shit!
- Stop this bus!

45:09.378 --> 45:11.048
- Pump the brakes!
- The gas pedal is stuck!

45:11.213 --> 45:13.217
- Do something!
- Abandon bus!

45:13.383 --> 45:15.086
Abandon bus!
We need to get off this bus!

45:15.251 --> 45:16.786
Ren, you gotta get off, man!

45:27.932 --> 45:32.107
The wheels on the bus go
boom, boom, boom!

45:32.269 --> 45:35.643
Yes, sir! Get some! Fire it up!

45:35.807 --> 45:37.744
- You OK, baby?
- Oh, my God!

45:39.977 --> 45:41.480
Get some!

45:43.114 --> 45:47.088
That was awesome!
Let's do that again! Yes!

45:59.666 --> 46:03.340
Hey, man. Chuck's pretty sore
about losing that race.

46:03.503 --> 46:07.310
I mean, you blew up
the man's bus, dude.

46:09.476 --> 46:13.651
Yeah... Bomont blows, dude.

46:13.815 --> 46:15.685
I don't have to tell you, though, do I?

46:15.850 --> 46:19.089
Yeah. I've been to Chicago. St. Louis.

46:19.253 --> 46:23.361
Been up to some of them clubs
in New York City. I been around.

46:23.524 --> 46:25.160
- Just like you, man.
- Oh, yeah?

46:25.326 --> 46:26.629
Yeah.

46:36.105 --> 46:37.173
Hey.

46:38.207 --> 46:41.847
You get high?
'Cause I do... every damn day.

46:42.012 --> 46:45.118
If you want, you and I
can go burn one right after school.

46:45.281 --> 46:48.120
You know, city mouse, country mouse...

46:48.284 --> 46:49.653
Blazing!

46:49.820 --> 46:52.224
What makes you think
I'm anything like you?

46:52.389 --> 46:53.859
Hold on a second.

46:57.495 --> 46:59.799
This is what we call a take-homer.
You need anything else?

46:59.930 --> 47:01.466
- I don't want this.
- It's cool. It's cool.

47:01.632 --> 47:02.734
No, it's not cool. Take this...

47:02.901 --> 47:04.971
We can go down to the
railroad tracks and chief one now.

47:05.136 --> 47:06.839
- No, seriously, take this.
- Hey!

47:07.005 --> 47:09.343
- What is that?
- What's what?

47:09.508 --> 47:11.245
In your hand. Let me see it.

47:11.410 --> 47:12.678
Young man. Hey!

47:12.844 --> 47:16.084
Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

47:16.248 --> 47:17.985
Hey! Stop!

47:20.019 --> 47:21.020
Open the door!

47:22.021 --> 47:23.324
Open!

47:26.559 --> 47:31.268
I will not tolerate it, Ren.
Not in my school.

47:31.431 --> 47:32.934
So what have you gotta say for yourself?

47:33.099 --> 47:35.938
What do I have to say? I was on
the gymnastics team for three years.

47:36.102 --> 47:38.941
Got drug tested all the time.
If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.

47:39.106 --> 47:41.710
- He had a ioint...
- You know what one looks like?

47:41.876 --> 47:43.679
Were you going to smoke it or sell it?

47:43.845 --> 47:47.519
Mr. Parker says you were with
Rich Sawyer when this went down.

47:47.682 --> 47:50.187
- I don't even know that prick.
- Hey! Language.

47:50.351 --> 47:51.953
Ren, level with me.

47:52.120 --> 47:56.261
Was it Rich's ioint? You can tell me.

47:59.127 --> 48:00.563
I don't do drugs.

48:01.630 --> 48:03.867
You can test me.
And when it comes out clean,

48:04.033 --> 48:07.273
I want this guy investigated for
barging into the bathroom stall with me.

48:07.436 --> 48:08.571
That's gross.

48:10.239 --> 48:14.381
Well. Since we don't have the evidence,

48:14.544 --> 48:16.915
I'm going to let you off
with a warning this time.

48:17.080 --> 48:19.986
But Ren, listen to me,
you have to understand something.

48:20.150 --> 48:24.258
You see, life is not some big party.

48:24.421 --> 48:29.398
I don't care what the rap music
people say, marijuana is just wrong.

48:32.563 --> 48:34.266
Son, listen to me.

48:37.268 --> 48:39.806
Ren, I knew your momma.

48:39.972 --> 48:41.742
That's right. I knew Sandy.

48:43.075 --> 48:45.413
She had a wild spark, iust like you.

48:45.577 --> 48:48.917
Running off up north, trying to live
the high life might have been fun,

48:49.082 --> 48:51.119
but it also led her into getting
into some kind of...

48:53.352 --> 48:58.830
- ... unexpected trouble.
- Unexpected trouble.

49:00.426 --> 49:03.331
I'm thinking when you say "unexpected
trouble," you're talking about me.

49:03.496 --> 49:05.166
Right? Right?

49:05.331 --> 49:09.506
Look, believe me, don't believe me.
Suspend me, arrest me. I don't care.

49:09.670 --> 49:11.507
But you do me one favor, all right?

49:11.672 --> 49:15.680
Never talk to me about my mother again.
You understand?

49:16.277 --> 49:17.445
Hey!

49:19.380 --> 49:21.384
Let him go.

49:23.119 --> 49:24.654
Hey, MacCormack.

49:26.989 --> 49:28.491
What's the rush?

49:30.458 --> 49:31.961
Dude, you trying to
ignore me or something?

49:32.128 --> 49:34.031
I'm doing the best that I can!

50:27.320 --> 50:28.388
Massachusetts, huh?

50:28.555 --> 50:30.859
You got that music cranked
pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack.

50:31.025 --> 50:33.129
"You got that music
cranked pretty loud, Mr. MacCormack. "

50:33.293 --> 50:34.863
Yeah! No shit, Barney Fife!

50:35.462 --> 50:36.965
Watch that attitude, son.

50:37.131 --> 50:38.400
Try being a cop in Boston,
you huckleberry!

50:38.566 --> 50:40.970
- I will not tolerate it, Ren.
- Shut up! I'm talking!

50:41.135 --> 50:42.137
Not in my school.

50:42.303 --> 50:44.306
Mr. Dunbar.
Mr. Douchebag! Mr. Dumb-Ass.

50:44.472 --> 50:46.209
With your righteousness
and your little vest.

50:46.374 --> 50:47.777
Stop trying to act like you know me!

50:47.943 --> 50:50.414
Don't act like you know me. Don't try
and act like you know my mother!

50:50.579 --> 50:52.449
You don't know the pain
she went through every day.

50:52.614 --> 50:54.284
You don't know shit!
You don't know shit!

53:12.965 --> 53:15.235
