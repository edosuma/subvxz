All agents, move in! Move in now!

01:20.573 --> 01:22.517
- Go, go, go!
- FBI! Don't move!

01:22.541 --> 01:24.458
Do not move!

01:25.759 --> 01:27.504
Hands behind your head!

01:27.528 --> 01:28.905
Do it now!

01:28.929 --> 01:31.575
Hands behind your head!

01:39.072 --> 01:40.617
Erica Shepherd...

01:40.641 --> 01:42.585
You're under arrest
for espionage and conspiracy

01:42.609 --> 01:44.546
against the United States of America.

01:45.846 --> 01:47.123
Get her out of here.

01:47.147 --> 01:48.491
Let's go.

01:48.967 --> 01:50.760
We need to get a transport.

01:50.784 --> 01:53.195
She's the most hated woman in America.

01:53.219 --> 01:55.297
CIA agent Erica Shepherd

01:55.321 --> 01:56.933
spied for rogue terrorist Mikhail Tal.

01:56.957 --> 02:00.069
Four Americans died
as a result of her actions.

02:00.093 --> 02:01.838
The Benedict Arnold of our generation.

02:01.862 --> 02:04.741
One of the worst traitors
this country has ever seen.

Baggage handler to gate 7.

02:16.943 --> 02:19.643
Any available baggage handler to gate 7.

02:31.623 --> 02:33.268
Mommy's got to go to work.

02:33.292 --> 02:35.764
Come on, boo boo. I love you.

02:39.264 --> 02:40.776
The weather in Philadelphia this morning

02:40.800 --> 02:42.343
is a chilly 42 degrees,

02:42.367 --> 02:43.701
the kind of weather
that makes you want to...

04:13.758 --> 04:14.812
Danyal, what's going on?

04:14.836 --> 04:16.769
We got three attacks,
three different cities.

04:16.793 --> 04:18.704
Philadelphia, New York, and here in D.C.

04:18.728 --> 04:20.305
- Victims?
- 14 dead so far

04:20.329 --> 04:21.874
including a Treasure Department officer,

04:21.898 --> 04:24.109
a US Distract Attorney,
and three CIA operatives.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.666
- What time were the attacks?
- 8:00 a.m. All three.

04:27.737 --> 04:29.127
This was planned.

04:29.572 --> 04:31.639
Synchronized, just like before.

04:32.942 --> 04:34.591
This is Tal.

04:38.648 --> 04:41.894
Mikhail Vassily Tal, 49 years old,

04:41.918 --> 04:43.362
former Russian SVR agent,

04:43.386 --> 04:45.341
and one of the greatest threats
to America today.

04:45.342 --> 04:46.886
In 2015,

04:46.910 --> 04:49.689
he carried out the bombings
of Flight 6175 in Boston.

04:49.713 --> 04:51.657
Twenty-one people were ripped apart

04:51.681 --> 04:52.892
when the bomb was detonated

04:52.916 --> 04:54.427
while the plane was at its gate.

04:54.451 --> 04:55.862
Had that plane been airborne,

04:55.886 --> 04:57.730
the death toll would've risen to include

04:57.754 --> 05:01.422
every single one of the 283
passengers aboard that flight.

05:03.059 --> 05:05.537
That's what most of you know
about the attack.

05:05.561 --> 05:09.208
What most of you don't know is
that the bombing of Flight 6175

05:09.232 --> 05:12.378
was a trial run for
20 more bombings just like it.

05:12.402 --> 05:15.780
Thousands of American lives
were saved by the Intel

05:15.804 --> 05:17.182
that was gathered by the CIA.

05:17.206 --> 05:19.951
But months later, Tal retaliated,

05:19.975 --> 05:23.889
using Erica Shepherd to find and kill

05:23.913 --> 05:25.557
the four operatives
who stopped the bombings.

05:25.581 --> 05:27.393
You're certain Tal was behind this.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.827
There is not a doubt in my mind.

05:28.851 --> 05:31.163
The attacks three years ago
were retaliatory.

05:31.187 --> 05:32.398
Danyal?

05:32.422 --> 05:33.665
The victims killed this morning

05:33.689 --> 05:35.767
were part of a CIA lead task force

05:35.791 --> 05:38.170
targeting Mikhail Tal's finances.

05:38.194 --> 05:39.505
Tal is out there.

05:39.529 --> 05:41.139
He's well-funded
and he's planning an attack

05:41.163 --> 05:42.606
on American lives as we speak.

05:42.630 --> 05:44.075
You've been investigating Tal
for three years

05:44.099 --> 05:45.576
and this is all you have?

05:45.600 --> 05:47.412
Hunting Tal is like hunting
a shadow at night.

05:47.436 --> 05:50.181
Well, this shadow just killed
14 people, Agent Keaton.

05:50.205 --> 05:53.306
There has to be someone
who can help you find him.

05:54.342 --> 05:55.853
The Deputy is right, Will.

05:55.877 --> 05:57.021
We need to bring in another weapon.

05:57.045 --> 05:58.300
Huh, so who is it?

05:58.746 --> 06:01.359
Another agency? Foreign Intel?

06:01.383 --> 06:03.327
No. No, it's someone else,

06:03.351 --> 06:05.530
someone who knows Tal better than anyone.

06:05.554 --> 06:07.454
I want to bring in Erica Shepherd.

06:09.371 --> 06:10.435
What?

06:10.459 --> 06:12.437
She sees the world differently, Will.

06:12.461 --> 06:14.105
She was one of the best code breakers

06:14.129 --> 06:15.270
in the history of the CIA.

06:15.294 --> 06:16.541
Yeah, she's also a traitor.

06:16.565 --> 06:18.409
She worked with him.
She knows how he thinks.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.911
Hell, she was point on Tal
for years at the CIA.

06:20.935 --> 06:22.713
She killed Laine.

06:22.737 --> 06:25.285
She killed my fiancée.
Did you forget that?

06:27.548 --> 06:28.591
No.

06:28.776 --> 06:30.499
No, I'm not doing it.

06:31.512 --> 06:32.790
Then I have to find someone who will.

06:32.814 --> 06:34.124
You're not taking this case from me.

06:34.148 --> 06:35.325
You're not giving me a choice, Will.

06:35.349 --> 06:36.927
Americans are dead.

06:36.951 --> 06:39.362
God knows how many more are at risk.

06:39.386 --> 06:41.031
Erica Shepherd is the only chance we have

06:41.055 --> 06:42.600
to find the man responsible.

06:42.624 --> 06:44.768
I know what she took from you.
Believe me, I do.

06:45.055 --> 06:47.137
But this is the last card
we have left to play.

06:47.161 --> 06:48.939
Now I'm not asking you to like it, Will.

06:48.963 --> 06:51.228
I'm asking you to do your job.

07:48.988 --> 07:51.222
Hello, Agent Keaton.

08:04.301 --> 08:06.204
This won't take long.

08:07.106 --> 08:09.451
I want to be here
about as much as you do.

08:09.475 --> 08:10.890
I doubt that.

08:11.377 --> 08:13.393
I'm here to make you an offer.

08:16.021 --> 08:17.793
The FBI and the Department of Justice

08:17.817 --> 08:21.330
is willing to grant you
certain concessions

08:21.354 --> 08:22.698
in exchange for your cooperation.

08:22.722 --> 08:23.932
With what?

08:24.404 --> 08:25.655
Mikhail Tal.

08:29.061 --> 08:30.739
I haven't cooperated before.

08:30.763 --> 08:31.940
What makes you think I will now?

08:31.964 --> 08:33.955
Because you live in a glass box.

08:34.831 --> 08:36.443
Because you haven't been
allowed to see a visitor

08:36.467 --> 08:37.511
in over three years.

08:37.535 --> 08:39.602
Because, believe it or not...

08:40.572 --> 08:43.048
I can make life even worse for you.

08:43.609 --> 08:45.258
What concessions?

08:47.813 --> 08:49.429
Extra showers.

08:50.347 --> 08:52.582
Up to an hour of music per week to start.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.230
Here?

08:55.254 --> 08:56.798
No, if you agree to cooperate,

08:56.822 --> 08:57.999
you'll be transferred to

08:58.023 --> 08:59.968
a federal detention facility in D.C.

09:07.832 --> 09:09.176
There's been chatter

09:09.200 --> 09:10.945
that Tal is planning
to carry out another attack

09:10.969 --> 09:13.411
on members of the U.S.
intelligence community.

09:14.072 --> 09:16.673
The FBI wants your help to stop him.

09:32.491 --> 09:34.001
Liar.

09:34.025 --> 09:36.058
Excuse me?

09:37.936 --> 09:39.340
What'd you say?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.342
You want information on Mikhail Tal.

09:42.366 --> 09:44.000
That much is true.

09:45.068 --> 09:47.447
But the FBI didn't send you,
of all people,

09:47.471 --> 09:48.783
halfway across the country

09:48.807 --> 09:50.851
because Tal is planning an attack.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.587
You're here because
he's already carried one out.

09:53.611 --> 09:55.389
I want to know how to find him.

09:55.413 --> 09:56.824
You will never find him.

09:56.848 --> 09:59.093
Tal killed 14 people this morning.

09:59.117 --> 10:02.696
Three of them were CIA agents.
You used to be one of them.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.087
I need to know who he's working with.

10:07.058 --> 10:10.092
You need to look
for someone on the inside.

10:11.830 --> 10:13.763
No.

10:14.933 --> 10:16.277
No, see, not everyone

10:16.301 --> 10:18.868
is capable of selling
their soul like you are.

10:22.072 --> 10:24.350
You have no idea
what people are capable of.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.820
I know what you're capable of!

10:26.844 --> 10:29.355
I know what you're capable of!

10:29.379 --> 10:31.412
Back off, Keaton, now!

10:33.750 --> 10:35.368
Get him out of here.

10:35.919 --> 10:37.871
Wait!

10:40.749 --> 10:42.335
You should look
for someone on the inside.

10:42.359 --> 10:44.559
That's how Tal did it with me last time.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.330
And as for helping him find Tal...

10:50.167 --> 10:51.551
When do I leave?

10:56.939 --> 10:58.183
We're going to implant a GPS transponder

10:58.207 --> 10:59.718
into your body.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.419
It'll be locked around
your subclavian artery.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.088
You try to remove it,

11:03.112 --> 11:05.790
you'll tear a vessel and bleed
out within 60 seconds.

11:05.814 --> 11:07.993
You're not going anywhere
without us knowing.

11:15.358 --> 11:17.202
- Morning.
- Morning.

11:17.226 --> 11:18.837
What are you eating for breakfast?

11:18.861 --> 11:20.038
An energy bar.

11:20.062 --> 11:21.706
That's a candy bar in gym clothes.

11:21.730 --> 11:22.875
You should eat eggs.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.076
Why don't you make me some?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.143
I'll learn how to cook them tomorrow.

11:25.167 --> 11:26.544
Come on, let's go. We're late.

11:26.568 --> 11:28.512
Hurry up and I'll let you drive.

11:28.536 --> 11:29.613
Really?

11:29.637 --> 11:31.515
- No.
- Mom.

11:31.539 --> 11:33.351
Someday. Not in my car.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.840
Let's go.

11:46.922 --> 11:48.366
- Hey, Kate.
- Huh?

11:48.390 --> 11:49.841
Heads-up... Keaton just
pulled in downstairs.

11:49.865 --> 11:51.468
What? He's back already?

11:51.492 --> 11:53.437
What was he doing in Colorado anyways?

11:53.461 --> 11:54.447
He wouldn't say.

11:54.472 --> 11:56.040
Well, you're an interrogator, Danyal.

11:56.064 --> 11:57.174
Can't you pull it out of him?

11:57.198 --> 11:58.642
Even I'm not that good.

11:58.666 --> 11:59.843
He really didn't say anything?

11:59.867 --> 12:01.145
'Cause Keaton tells you everything.

12:01.169 --> 12:03.813
- Not this time.
- Ugh, I'm really curious.

12:03.837 --> 12:05.874
- Hey, Danyal.
- What's up, Bragg?

12:05.898 --> 12:07.150
What's up is Metro PD's

12:07.174 --> 12:08.952
got the whole crime scene
locked up like a damn vault.

12:08.976 --> 12:10.453
So let's throw our weight around

12:10.477 --> 12:11.754
and we can get our techs
in there tonight.

12:11.778 --> 12:13.290
No, we can't without
the Assistant Director

12:13.314 --> 12:14.724
signing off on it
and that's not gonna happen.

12:14.748 --> 12:17.193
All right, then I'm going
down there myself.

12:17.217 --> 12:19.055
Oh, my God.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.131
Rangers.

12:57.802 --> 13:00.536
You're looking at Agent Bragg's watch.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.905
Tactical G-shock, so you're
thinking former military

13:02.929 --> 13:04.529
but you're not sure which unit.

13:05.643 --> 13:06.965
Rangers.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.536
Sit.

13:21.881 --> 13:23.359
What is going on, Will?

13:23.383 --> 13:24.659
Why is Erica Shepherd
sitting in our office?

13:24.683 --> 13:26.128
Bregman wanted to bring her in

13:26.152 --> 13:27.629
because he thinks she can help catch Tal.

13:27.653 --> 13:29.531
- And you went along with it?
- I didn't have a choice.

13:29.555 --> 13:31.367
You sure, Will? 'cause it
kind of looks like we just gave

13:31.391 --> 13:32.868
the worst traitor in the last
50 years a visitor's badge.

13:32.892 --> 13:34.076
Either we work with Shepherd

13:34.100 --> 13:36.005
or Bregman is gonna assign
the case to someone that will.

13:36.029 --> 13:37.839
- But...
- But what, Kate?

13:38.276 --> 13:39.810
What about Laine?

13:41.512 --> 13:44.079
The man that killed Laine
is still out there.

13:44.103 --> 13:46.081
If I have to work with
the devil to catch Tal,

13:46.105 --> 13:47.644
I will.

13:49.174 --> 13:51.319
We're actually doing this.

13:51.343 --> 13:52.820
Fourteen people were
assassinated this morning

13:52.844 --> 13:54.855
including three CIA agents:

13:54.879 --> 13:58.926
Andrew Carris, Lynn Paige,
and junior analyst Anna Cruz.

13:58.950 --> 14:00.594
Where are we on
the car shooting in Philly?

14:00.618 --> 14:02.630
Witnesses reported seeing
two men riding motorcycles,

14:02.654 --> 14:05.545
but no license plate numbers
or descriptions of the drivers.

14:05.569 --> 14:06.679
Video?

14:06.703 --> 14:08.836
There's no security cameras
on the country roads,

14:08.860 --> 14:10.371
but I'm searching other sources.

14:10.395 --> 14:11.672
What about the bombing in New York?

14:11.696 --> 14:13.207
- What do we know?
- Not a lot.

14:13.231 --> 14:14.909
Forensics are still working
on the cause of the explosion.

14:14.933 --> 14:16.944
Tell me we have something
on the Union Station hit.

14:16.968 --> 14:18.979
Metro PD's still processing the scene.

14:19.003 --> 14:20.280
I mean, it could be tomorrow morning

14:20.304 --> 14:21.434
until we get anything useful.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.116
Okay, it's been 16 hours
and we have nothing.

14:23.140 --> 14:25.641
That's because you're dealing
with Mikhail Tal.

14:27.244 --> 14:28.589
He knows how your investigation works

14:28.613 --> 14:30.223
and he knows how to beat it.

14:30.247 --> 14:32.092
That's why he's still out there.

14:32.116 --> 14:33.794
To find him, you have
to start pulling on threads

14:33.818 --> 14:36.118
that you never thought to before.

14:38.122 --> 14:39.833
In the past, Tal was known to go after

14:39.857 --> 14:40.968
his target's cell phones.

14:40.992 --> 14:42.135
Kate?

14:42.159 --> 14:44.471
Uh, we checked the recovered cells.
There's no sign of cloning.

14:44.495 --> 14:46.574
That's because he doesn't clone them.

14:46.598 --> 14:47.741
He rips them.

14:47.765 --> 14:49.209
What's the difference?

14:49.233 --> 14:50.945
Cloning lets you see
incoming calls and texts.

14:50.969 --> 14:52.412
It's like listening in on a second line.

14:52.436 --> 14:54.815
Ripping is when you make
a digital copy of the phone.

14:54.839 --> 14:57.084
It is also impossible to detect.

14:57.108 --> 14:58.718
Almost impossible.

14:58.742 --> 14:59.852
When a cell is being ripped,

14:59.876 --> 15:02.122
it can't receive incoming calls.

15:02.146 --> 15:03.590
- So...
- So if a call comes in

15:03.614 --> 15:04.857
during the 20 minute process,

15:04.881 --> 15:06.493
it shows up on the phone records,

15:06.517 --> 15:08.261
- but not on...
- But not on the phone itself.

15:08.285 --> 15:09.729
You find the discrepancy

15:09.753 --> 15:12.299
and you not only find evidence
of a ripped phone,

15:12.323 --> 15:17.170
but you find the exact time
and date that it happened.

15:17.194 --> 15:19.506
Unless you're lying to us.

15:19.530 --> 15:20.773
Unless you're telling us anything

15:20.797 --> 15:23.176
to keep us from following the real leads.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.279
You're right, Agent Keaton.
I could be lying.

15:26.303 --> 15:28.770
But you're still gonna check
those phone records...

15:29.740 --> 15:31.117
unless you wanna keep searching

15:31.141 --> 15:33.775
for video surveillance of country roads.

15:37.948 --> 15:39.258
If you're wrong about this,

15:39.282 --> 15:41.582
you're on a plane back to ADMAX tonight.

15:44.921 --> 15:47.122
Run the search.

15:58.401 --> 15:59.912
Okay.

15:59.936 --> 16:01.346
Treasury Official Joseph Sebring

16:01.370 --> 16:04.476
had a call come in at 3:28 p.m.
on Tuesday the 13th.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.918
But the call never showed up
on the phone.

16:06.942 --> 16:09.387
That's impossible
unless Shepherd was right.

16:09.411 --> 16:10.622
So how'd he do it?

16:10.646 --> 16:12.090
Tal, or somebody working for him,

16:12.114 --> 16:14.225
would need to be within
ten feet of the target's cell

16:14.249 --> 16:15.827
in order to rip it remotely.

16:15.851 --> 16:17.395
Which means we're looking
for someone who was within

16:17.419 --> 16:20.554
ten feet of Sebring at 3:28 on the 13th.

16:22.091 --> 16:23.535
We've got her.

16:23.559 --> 16:25.137
She's a hacker named Ines Nguyen.

16:25.161 --> 16:27.072
We caught her on security
footage at a café with Sebring.

16:44.646 --> 16:46.357
You're here because you were
caught on camera

16:46.381 --> 16:48.626
ripping the cell phone
of a Treasury Official.

16:48.650 --> 16:51.685
An official who was killed in
an office explosion yesterday.

16:52.987 --> 16:54.599
So you have a problem.

16:54.623 --> 16:56.568
Look, I'm trying to help you
fix your problem,

16:56.592 --> 16:59.926
but the only way I can is if
you start telling me the truth.

17:02.297 --> 17:03.896
Okay.

17:07.801 --> 17:10.547
I was contacted by a man
named Victor Nemec.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.316
What did Nemec want from you?

17:12.848 --> 17:15.853
He paid me four grand to rip
this guy Sebring's cell.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.185
Where's Nemec now?

17:17.435 --> 17:19.056
I don't know, I have
the phone number he gave me.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.057
That's... that's it.

17:20.080 --> 17:21.290
What about Mikhail Tal?

17:21.315 --> 17:22.760
Did Nemec ever mention his name?

17:22.784 --> 17:24.569
No, never.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.832
Was there anyone else with him?

17:27.856 --> 17:29.198
No.

17:33.628 --> 17:35.288
She's lying.

17:37.198 --> 17:38.542
What?

17:38.566 --> 17:40.444
She's lying about something.

17:40.468 --> 17:43.702
No. Someone.

17:43.726 --> 17:45.082
Is there something
you're not telling me, Ines?

17:45.106 --> 17:47.073
No.

17:50.844 --> 17:52.856
Who was with Nemec?

17:52.880 --> 17:55.478
- What?
- Someone else was with Nemec.

17:55.502 --> 17:56.860
Who was it?

17:56.884 --> 17:58.428
I don't... I don't know.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.829
You don't know. She don't...

17:59.853 --> 18:02.421
- Who was with Nemec?
- I don't know her name!

18:03.957 --> 18:05.702
I don't know her name.

18:05.726 --> 18:08.541
When I heard that Sebring's
office had been bombed,

18:08.565 --> 18:10.674
I-I freaked out so I went to see Nemec.

18:10.698 --> 18:12.542
He, um,

18:12.566 --> 18:14.619
he was putting a woman in his car.

18:15.002 --> 18:17.538
Her hands were bound. She...

18:18.206 --> 18:20.817
She looked really messed up. She...

18:20.841 --> 18:25.243
I don't... I think that maybe
she was in that explosion.

18:29.048 --> 18:31.427
- Was that her?
- No.

18:31.451 --> 18:33.284
- Is that her?
- No.

18:35.355 --> 18:37.232
Wait, that's...

18:37.256 --> 18:41.062
That's her; that's the woman
Nemec was putting in his car.

18:42.438 --> 18:44.073
She's alive.

18:47.801 --> 18:49.967
She's alive.

18:55.827 --> 18:57.595
My name is Anna Cruz.

18:57.620 --> 18:59.764
I'm 27 years old and I'm
interviewing for a position

18:59.832 --> 19:01.144
as a financial analyst.

19:01.168 --> 19:03.572
And why do you want to work for the CIA?

19:03.597 --> 19:05.475
It's a challenge and an opportunity

19:05.499 --> 19:07.744
to work with some
of our nation's best minds.

19:07.768 --> 19:10.013
Working at the Agency means
I get to be part of

19:10.037 --> 19:11.948
the first line of defense for my country.

19:11.972 --> 19:13.583
I get to help save lives.

19:13.607 --> 19:16.019
God bless America. Welcome to the CIA.

19:16.043 --> 19:18.021
Thank you.

19:26.286 --> 19:29.054
How long have you been at
the FBI, Agent Ryan?

19:30.090 --> 19:31.467
Six years.

19:31.491 --> 19:32.768
Have you always been in
counterintelligence?

19:32.792 --> 19:34.257
- Yes.
- Under Agent Keaton?

19:34.281 --> 19:35.337
Yes?

19:35.361 --> 19:37.159
How long have you been in love with him?

19:39.285 --> 19:40.289
Listen up,

19:40.449 --> 19:42.611
Anna Cruz is out there alone
and in danger.

19:42.635 --> 19:45.581
She's counting on us.
Her family is counting on us.

19:45.605 --> 19:47.316
So no mistakes, no excuses.

19:47.340 --> 19:48.784
We find her and we bring her home.

19:48.808 --> 19:50.953
Here's who we're looking for.
Victor Nemec.

19:50.977 --> 19:52.422
43 years old.

19:52.446 --> 19:54.223
Wanted by seven different
countries for espionage

19:54.247 --> 19:55.958
and political assassination.

19:55.982 --> 19:57.360
We checked his last known address,

19:57.384 --> 19:59.062
came up empty,
same with known associates.

19:59.086 --> 20:00.754
Let's concentrate on his cell.

20:00.778 --> 20:02.297
Kate, now where are you on that trace?

20:02.321 --> 20:04.399
Nemec's cell pinged off of
a tower near the bombing site

20:04.423 --> 20:06.834
36 hours ago, but nothing since then.

20:06.858 --> 20:08.570
Seventy-eight minutes after the attack,

20:08.594 --> 20:11.506
somebody texted Nemec a photo
from a blocked number.

20:11.530 --> 20:12.874
The Seine River in Paris?

20:12.898 --> 20:14.476
That building right there. What is that?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.511
Yeah, we looked into it.
It's a children's hospital.

20:16.535 --> 20:17.879
Well, why is Nemec being sent a map

20:17.903 --> 20:20.915
of a children's hospital in Paris?

20:20.939 --> 20:22.451
He's not.

20:22.475 --> 20:24.719
It's called a location cutout.

20:24.743 --> 20:26.488
It's been decades since they were used.

20:26.512 --> 20:28.423
They were common spycraft
for the Soviet nations

20:28.447 --> 20:29.770
during the Cold War.

20:29.794 --> 20:32.260
Correspondence was constantly
intercepted back then.

20:32.284 --> 20:33.995
So operatives couldn't risk sending a map

20:34.019 --> 20:35.396
of their actual location.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.065
So they would send a section of a map

20:37.089 --> 20:39.834
from a different city
that looked like theirs.

20:39.858 --> 20:41.102
A cutout.

20:41.126 --> 20:42.570
Most cities have similar features, right?

20:42.594 --> 20:44.606
Roads, bridges, parks.

20:44.630 --> 20:47.041
- In this case...
- An island.

20:47.065 --> 20:48.542
Nemec was last seen in Brooklyn.

20:48.566 --> 20:50.177
- Kate, pull it.
- Already on it.

20:50.201 --> 20:51.646
The Governor's Island is
closest to Brooklyn.

20:51.670 --> 20:52.880
Try that one.

20:52.904 --> 20:54.415
No. What else is nearby?

20:54.439 --> 20:56.280
- Roosevelt.
- Pull that up.

20:57.042 --> 20:58.532
Overlayer.

20:59.477 --> 21:01.188
That building that's pinned on
the Roosevelt map.

21:01.212 --> 21:02.256
What is that?

21:02.280 --> 21:03.224
It's an apartment building.

21:03.248 --> 21:04.993
We got Nemec.

21:05.017 --> 21:06.628
Danyal, call the New York office.

21:06.652 --> 21:08.063
Get them on that building ASAP.
How long for the plane?

21:08.087 --> 21:09.696
If we leave now, we can be
wheels up in 20 minutes.

21:09.720 --> 21:12.388
Whoa, whoa. What about Hannibal Lecter?

21:16.761 --> 21:18.260
Don't do this.

21:18.963 --> 21:20.741
You wouldn't even know
Anna Cruz was alive

21:20.765 --> 21:21.808
if it weren't for me.

21:21.832 --> 21:22.976
If it weren't for you?

21:23.000 --> 21:26.913
If it weren't for you.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.882
Hmm, yeah. That's a happy thought.

21:28.906 --> 21:30.898
- I can do more. I can...
- No!

21:31.442 --> 21:33.987
There is no redemption
for people like you.

21:34.011 --> 21:36.157
You're a traitor and you're a killer.

21:36.181 --> 21:37.691
You don't think I know that?

21:37.715 --> 21:39.393
I wake up every day knowing

21:39.417 --> 21:40.861
those four people are dead because of me.

21:40.885 --> 21:42.485
They have names!

21:43.788 --> 21:46.367
Those four people have names.

21:46.391 --> 21:50.737
Steven Haibach, Brian Lanich,

21:50.761 --> 21:52.539
Desiree Villareal,

21:52.563 --> 21:55.840
and Laine Heffron, your fiancée.

21:56.433 --> 21:58.466
I know their names, Agent Keaton.

21:59.269 --> 22:01.648
I know the names of their
parents and their children.

22:01.672 --> 22:02.949
I know everything about them

22:02.973 --> 22:04.584
because I've lived with their ghosts

22:04.608 --> 22:06.352
for the last three years.

22:06.376 --> 22:08.143
And so have I.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.314
You've been in my life too long.

22:13.684 --> 22:16.196
When Laine was at the CIA, she would...

22:16.220 --> 22:17.778
she would come home.

22:18.555 --> 22:21.101
And she would tell me all about this...

22:21.125 --> 22:23.236
this brilliant woman she worked with.

22:23.260 --> 22:25.060
She didn't just look up to you.

22:25.895 --> 22:27.788
She wanted to be you.

22:33.469 --> 22:35.169
If it weren't for you...

22:47.851 --> 22:50.662
All right. Be operator. Let's go.

22:50.686 --> 22:52.564
- Any sign of Anna Cruz?
- No, nothing yet.

22:52.588 --> 22:53.609
All right, let's get in there.

22:53.633 --> 22:55.389
Danyal, with me. Let's go.

23:32.127 --> 23:34.226
Let's go. Let's go. Now.

23:45.506 --> 23:48.051
I'm gonna give you
some Novocain for the pain.

23:48.075 --> 23:49.853
- Do you have any allergies?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

23:49.877 --> 23:51.410
Okay.

23:53.347 --> 23:54.541
Ah!

23:55.082 --> 23:56.648
Amy, we're gonna need some x-rays.

24:03.891 --> 24:06.670
Charlie Team, entering third floor.

24:06.694 --> 24:08.838
D Team, just entering four.

24:10.030 --> 24:11.307
Door on two.

24:11.331 --> 24:13.227
FBI. Open up.

24:28.514 --> 24:29.892
FBI! Freeze!

24:29.916 --> 24:31.983
- Freeze!
- Check that apartment!

24:58.077 --> 24:59.521
- Damn it!
- Bragg, are you hit?

24:59.545 --> 25:00.510
Are you hit?

25:00.535 --> 25:01.790
I think it caught the vest.

25:01.814 --> 25:03.792
Danyal, get his gun.

25:03.816 --> 25:05.154
Let me see.

25:06.118 --> 25:07.496
No blood. You're good, you're good.

25:07.520 --> 25:09.019
Let's get you out of here.

25:17.596 --> 25:20.363
Where is she? Where's Anna Cruz?

25:22.534 --> 25:26.681
All great empires die from within.

25:30.809 --> 25:32.709
It's okay.

25:33.845 --> 25:35.089
You all right?

25:35.113 --> 25:36.391
Did you find Cruz?

25:36.415 --> 25:38.793
She wasn't there. Neither was Nemec.

25:38.817 --> 25:40.761
But they were. This is Cruz's cell.

25:40.785 --> 25:41.929
It was in the apartment powered off.

25:41.953 --> 25:43.920
We just missed her.

25:50.561 --> 25:52.861
The x-ray scan takes 30 seconds.

25:53.564 --> 25:55.697
Sir, you're gonna wanna step out.

26:44.247 --> 26:46.192
This is Keaton.

26:46.216 --> 26:48.194
Will, we have a problem.

26:48.218 --> 26:50.251
Erica Shepherd has escaped.

26:57.364 --> 26:59.665
She was in our custody.
How the hell did she escape?

26:59.690 --> 27:01.119
She had a medical emergency

27:01.144 --> 27:02.480
and she was transported off site.

27:02.504 --> 27:03.581
Where is she now?

27:03.605 --> 27:04.782
We don't know.

27:04.806 --> 27:06.149
You don't know. You don't know.

27:06.173 --> 27:07.685
The woman's a walking threat
to national security

27:07.709 --> 27:09.353
and you don't know where she is.

27:09.377 --> 27:11.721
What about the device the
was planted in her chest?

27:11.745 --> 27:14.079
It's gone dark.

27:15.616 --> 27:18.061
She escaped wearing a lead apron.

27:18.085 --> 27:21.198
We think it's why the GPS
device isn't transmitting.

27:58.091 --> 27:59.701
We're sitting on Shepherd's old address

27:59.725 --> 28:01.270
and her ex-husband's place.

28:01.294 --> 28:03.539
Nothing yet. You knew her
better than anyone.

28:03.563 --> 28:04.840
Where is she going?

28:04.864 --> 28:06.608
I have no idea. Okay, as far as I know

28:06.632 --> 28:08.311
she hasn't spoken to anybody
in three years.

28:08.335 --> 28:10.446
We lost Cruz. There's no sign of Nemec.

28:10.470 --> 28:12.048
I'm gonna come back to D.C.
to find Shepherd.

28:12.072 --> 28:13.782
No. No, no, I need to you to stay there.

28:13.806 --> 28:15.206
I'll find her.

28:16.443 --> 28:17.853
How are you feeling?

28:17.877 --> 28:19.655
Like I just got shot in the chest.

28:19.679 --> 28:21.089
What did the medic say?

28:21.113 --> 28:23.191
Couple of cracked ribs.
I'll be all right.

28:23.215 --> 28:24.927
Yeah, it probably hurts a lot.

28:24.951 --> 28:27.028
You know, Will, only when I breathe.

28:27.052 --> 28:28.097
Hey, Will.

28:28.450 --> 28:29.798
Just scanned the laptop we found.

28:29.822 --> 28:31.633
Someone made multiple searches
for Logan Airport,

28:31.657 --> 28:33.469
Pier 19 Terminal, and North Station.

28:33.493 --> 28:35.571
I think Nemec is headed to Boston.

28:49.041 --> 28:50.218
If you agree to cooperate,

28:50.242 --> 28:51.619
you'll be transferred

28:51.643 --> 28:54.122
to a federal detention facility in D.C.

28:55.814 --> 28:57.160
Yes, Bregman.

28:57.184 --> 28:58.926
Shepherd didn't want to just
get out of prison.

28:58.950 --> 29:00.495
She wanted to go home.

29:00.519 --> 29:02.663
I know where she is.

31:13.033 --> 31:14.064
Hey, Kate, what's up?

31:14.435 --> 31:15.945
Shepherd is taken into custody

31:15.970 --> 31:17.644
and is being escorted back to holding.

31:17.669 --> 31:18.779
Any word on Nemec?

31:18.803 --> 31:20.081
A silver sedan was spotted

31:20.105 --> 31:21.716
entering the Pier 19 Shipping terminal.

31:21.740 --> 31:23.651
Danyal, we got Nemec. Pier 19.

31:23.675 --> 31:25.086
Be careful!

31:33.852 --> 31:35.210
This is Bregman.

31:36.922 --> 31:40.167
Oh, well, that is really
good news, Agent Ryan.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.569
That's great.

31:41.593 --> 31:43.260
Keep me in the loop in that.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.472
They found Nemec?

31:45.496 --> 31:47.274
He was spotted heading into
a shipping terminal

31:47.298 --> 31:48.743
in Jeffries Point.

31:48.767 --> 31:51.167
Keaton and the team are moving in now.

31:53.572 --> 31:56.172
Tal's leading them back to Boston.

31:57.103 --> 31:58.183
What?

31:58.207 --> 31:59.499
It was the site of the first attack.

31:59.523 --> 32:01.221
The bombings in Logan Airport.

32:01.245 --> 32:03.323
Tal doesn't just care about
getting Anna Cruz.

32:03.347 --> 32:06.575
He wants to take out as many
American lives as possible.

32:08.252 --> 32:09.830
Five years ago,

32:09.854 --> 32:12.700
I had a team of operatives that
were hunting Tal in Belgium.

32:12.724 --> 32:14.668
They followed him to the port of Antwerp,

32:14.692 --> 32:16.303
and when they got there, it was a trap.

32:16.327 --> 32:17.837
He had planted explosives.

32:17.861 --> 32:20.674
Half a dozen Belgian police
officers were killed by IEDs.

32:20.698 --> 32:22.798
He is leading them!

32:25.369 --> 32:27.304
Warn Keaton!

32:30.674 --> 32:32.786
Danyal, I just got a call from Bregman.

32:32.810 --> 32:35.021
He has Intel that Tal may have
planted IEDs here.

32:35.045 --> 32:36.190
So eyes open, okay?

32:36.214 --> 32:37.564
Copy that.

32:47.357 --> 32:49.935
I got a silver car 100 yards ahead!

32:49.959 --> 32:51.504
It's Nemec!

33:41.810 --> 33:43.555
Danyal, you okay?

33:43.579 --> 33:46.024
I'm good. Go, go! Get after him!

33:46.048 --> 33:48.382
Watch out! There might be more IEDs!

34:50.944 --> 34:52.509
Anna.

34:57.450 --> 34:59.050
I got you. I got you.

35:03.123 --> 35:05.253
Anna Cruz. Anna.

35:05.691 --> 35:08.303
Wake up, Anna. Anna. Can you wake up?

35:08.327 --> 35:10.239
Anna. Anna.

35:14.868 --> 35:17.046
I'm Agent Will Keaton. You're safe now.

35:17.070 --> 35:18.380
You're safe.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.008
I was hoping I'd see you.

35:34.032 --> 35:35.243
Listen, I'm... I'm sorry.
I... I can come back...

35:35.267 --> 35:36.544
No, please.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.512
Come in.

35:38.536 --> 35:41.403
I actually wanted to thank you.

35:42.474 --> 35:45.218
I wouldn't be alive
if it weren't for you.

35:45.242 --> 35:46.670
I'm just glad you're okay.

35:47.445 --> 35:49.297
Are you going to find him?

35:50.348 --> 35:53.093
- I'm trying.
- Those people Tal killed.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.345
They were my friends.

35:56.187 --> 35:58.454
I want to help with the investigation.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.570
I just need to make him pay
for what he did.

36:02.978 --> 36:04.705
Okay.

36:04.729 --> 36:06.574
We'll figure it out.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.632
- You get some rest, okay?
- Okay.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.697
I didn't think I'd see you
again, not after today.

36:43.767 --> 36:45.145
Wasn't really worried about it.

36:45.169 --> 36:47.069
Knew they'd catch you sooner or later.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.007
Do you really think I'd be
here if I wanted to escape?

36:54.411 --> 36:56.556
What are you doing, Erica?

36:56.580 --> 36:58.424
Why are you cooperating with us?

36:58.448 --> 37:00.793
Why did you warn me about the port?

37:00.817 --> 37:02.762
I'm not sure I can answer that.

37:02.786 --> 37:05.197
Well, I'm gonna have to tell
Bregman that he either

37:05.221 --> 37:08.489
sends you back to Colorado
tonight or I quit.

37:12.228 --> 37:13.798
I need to know.

37:14.831 --> 37:16.965
What happened the day Laine was killed?

37:17.601 --> 37:20.669
I need to know why, who did it.

37:21.572 --> 37:23.850
The real reason why you did it.

37:26.777 --> 37:27.820
Erica!

37:27.844 --> 37:30.923
The school called.
Hannah didn't show up today.

37:53.168 --> 37:55.102
Hello, Erica.

37:56.405 --> 37:58.316
I'm watching your daughter.

37:58.340 --> 38:01.518
- Tal.
- She is a beautiful girl.

38:03.311 --> 38:05.011
You should be very proud.

38:06.314 --> 38:08.025
I want their names.

38:08.049 --> 38:11.462
The four CIA operatives
who stopped those bombings.

38:11.486 --> 38:12.863
Don't hurt her!

38:12.887 --> 38:15.332
That isn't my decision to make.

38:15.356 --> 38:17.267
It's yours.

38:17.291 --> 38:20.493
It's up to you whether your
daughter dies today or not.

38:21.896 --> 38:23.574
It's a simple choice.

38:23.598 --> 38:25.843
- Can we talk?
- Your daughter's life

38:25.867 --> 38:27.945
or theirs. Wait! Wait!

38:27.969 --> 38:29.499
Five,

38:30.170 --> 38:32.348
four... Just stop counting!

38:32.372 --> 38:33.586
Three,

38:34.141 --> 38:35.418
two,

38:35.442 --> 38:36.786
one... Steven Haibach,

38:36.810 --> 38:39.322
Brian Lanich, Desiree Villareal,

38:39.346 --> 38:41.412
Laine Heffron!

38:42.349 --> 38:43.982
Thank you.

38:45.252 --> 38:47.684
I didn't work with Tal.

38:50.223 --> 38:52.147
I didn't spy for him.

38:58.966 --> 39:01.811
I made a choice to save my daughter.

39:01.835 --> 39:03.575
Then why didn't you say anything?

39:04.643 --> 39:06.703
Why did you keep it
a secret for three years?

39:08.408 --> 39:10.123
Hannah.

39:13.168 --> 39:14.890
Telling the world would mean
she'd have to live

39:14.914 --> 39:16.759
the rest of her life knowing
she was responsible

39:16.783 --> 39:18.561
for the death of four people.

39:18.585 --> 39:20.718
I couldn't do that to my daughter.

39:22.489 --> 39:24.400
People say they would die
for their children,

39:24.424 --> 39:26.472
but the truth is that's easy.

39:29.262 --> 39:31.728
Living for them is hard.

39:32.599 --> 39:34.355
Suffering for them...

39:36.357 --> 39:38.747
Giving up your freedom,
being hated by your country,

39:38.771 --> 39:40.305
that... that's hard.

39:42.661 --> 39:45.495
I want to be close to my daughter.

39:47.745 --> 39:51.814
I want to fight every day to
earn my way back into her life.

39:53.792 --> 39:56.893
I want to be the parent
my father never was.

39:59.944 --> 40:02.592
But I also want to catch Tal.

40:03.495 --> 40:05.307
Not just because he destroyed my life,

40:05.331 --> 40:06.808
but because every day that he is free

40:06.832 --> 40:09.666
is a day my daughter's life is unsafe.

40:10.636 --> 40:11.946
How?

40:11.970 --> 40:13.147
I spent three years in a cell

40:13.171 --> 40:14.616
asking myself that question

40:14.640 --> 40:16.251
and then it hit me.

40:16.275 --> 40:17.552
Tal didn't come after me

40:17.576 --> 40:19.387
because I helped stopped those bombings.

40:19.411 --> 40:22.156
He came after me because of
what I was about to discover.

40:22.180 --> 40:25.426
In 2013, there were a few dozen
rogue spies like Tal

40:25.450 --> 40:26.627
operating in the U.S.

40:26.651 --> 40:29.244
In 2014, a hundred.

40:29.754 --> 40:32.666
But in 2015, that number
skyrocketed to 3,000

40:32.690 --> 40:34.835
and it is still growing.

40:34.859 --> 40:36.604
These are highly trained
deadly operatives

40:36.628 --> 40:39.607
in every city, in every state,

40:39.631 --> 40:41.475
hiding in plain sight

40:41.499 --> 40:42.710
as teachers,

40:42.734 --> 40:44.010
engineers,

40:44.034 --> 40:46.747
husbands and wives.

40:46.771 --> 40:48.582
Ticking time bombs.

40:48.606 --> 40:52.119
This is not random.
This is a coordinated effort.

40:52.143 --> 40:55.188
- To do what?
- I don't know. Not yet.

40:55.212 --> 40:57.445
But I know that Tal is connected.

40:59.683 --> 41:02.277
You can stop him, Agent Keaton.

41:03.119 --> 41:05.405
You can save this country.

41:06.490 --> 41:08.701
But you cannot do it without me.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.626
Are you alone?

41:19.403 --> 41:20.795
Can you speak?

41:21.838 --> 41:23.131
Yes.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.118
Does the FBI suspect anything?

41:27.611 --> 41:29.345
No, nothing.

41:29.805 --> 41:32.483
How long before you make
contact with Agent Keaton?

41:32.715 --> 41:34.392
I already have.

41:35.430 --> 41:38.064
Your plan worked perfectly, Mikhail.

41:39.989 --> 41:41.566
I'm in.
