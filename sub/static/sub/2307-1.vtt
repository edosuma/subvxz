00:59.677 --> 01:04.062
Huh? You sure you got that?
Don't strain yourself.

01:17.127 --> 01:19.981
Well, that's it. Turned in my key.

01:20.081 --> 01:23.582
Yep. No turning back now.

01:24.467 --> 01:28.222
- You still think this is a good idea?
- What, me driving this thing?

01:28.322 --> 01:29.991
I told you, I'm more than
happy to let you drive.

01:30.091 --> 01:34.525
No, this, moving in with you. Having...

01:35.011 --> 01:37.331
Having this baby.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.680
Jessie, you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:41.452 --> 01:44.870
I've been ready for
this for a long time.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.131
I just remembered the weirdest
dream I had last night.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.281
It's the last chance to remove it.

02:27.381 --> 02:29.280
A little more suction, please.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.002
Can't see a thing in there.

02:35.338 --> 02:39.699
It's skull. It's part
of the guy's skull.

02:42.279 --> 02:44.782
Intertrochanteric fracture in your hip.

02:44.882 --> 02:47.552
Your left clavicle and
three ribs are shattered.

02:48.419 --> 02:52.089
You've got compound fractures
in your right and left tibia.

02:52.189 --> 02:56.511
Good news is you will walk again
within three or four months of therapy.

02:56.911 --> 02:58.760
My b... my baby?

03:02.749 --> 03:03.866
I'm sorry.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.170
I know it's been a long
haul for you, Jessie.

03:22.270 --> 03:25.807
But we'll still need to send a
physical therapist to you at home.

03:25.907 --> 03:29.661
Can someone come pick you up?
Your mother or father?

03:29.761 --> 03:32.764
My mom died of cancer when I was a baby,

03:32.864 --> 03:37.118
and my father gave me to my aunt
to be raised after my mom died.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.087
I haven't seen him in years.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.588
Miss Laurent, can he come
here to pick you up?

03:55.168 --> 03:56.418
Dad?

06:39.032 --> 06:41.166
Thanks for picking me up, Dad.

06:44.075 --> 06:45.056
Glad I could help.

06:47.273 --> 06:48.702
Sorry about your boyfriend.

07:03.823 --> 07:05.601
This was your mother's room.

07:06.301 --> 07:10.796
You're gonna have to stay in here.
The other bedrooms are upstairs.

07:51.888 --> 07:53.058
Let's get you in bed.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.314
When your aunt passed away, they...

08:22.414 --> 08:25.202
they gave me some things you had there.

08:25.302 --> 08:26.871
Clothes.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.092
You hungry?

08:36.118 --> 08:39.015
I could make you a
sandwich or something.

08:40.571 --> 08:44.823
No, I'm fine. Just tired is all.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.350
Oh, yeah, the water out of the
tap sometimes comes out bad.

08:52.450 --> 08:56.175
You just let it run
a little, it'll clear up.

09:26.849 --> 09:28.700
Preston.

11:13.956 --> 11:15.465
Dad?

11:15.615 --> 11:17.340
You here?

11:51.779 --> 11:57.703
<i>I live in America
with a pair of Payless shoes</i>

11:59.270 --> 12:05.205
<i>The Upper Peninsula
and the television news</i>

12:06.898 --> 12:10.154
<i>And I've seen my wife</i>

12:10.854 --> 12:13.749
<i>At the K-Mart...</i>

13:20.550 --> 13:22.639
Oh, my word.

13:22.989 --> 13:24.428
Thank you, Mama.

15:08.224 --> 15:10.191
<i>Hello, Jessabelle.</i>

15:10.876 --> 15:13.073
- Mom.
<i>- I went back and forth</i>

15:13.173 --> 15:15.806
<i>a hundred times whether or
not this was a good idea.</i>

15:15.906 --> 15:17.856
<i>Making these tapes.</i>

15:18.142 --> 15:20.418
<i>But as you can see, here I am.</i>

15:21.422 --> 15:26.160
<i>It is March 14th, and it is 1988,</i>

15:26.460 --> 15:31.361
<i>and I am seven months pregnant with you.</i>

15:34.300 --> 15:38.736
<i>I love you, Jessabelle. I love you.</i>

15:41.590 --> 15:43.934
<i>If you're watching this,</i>

15:45.745 --> 15:50.717
<i>it means I'm gone. But I don't
want this to be a day of sadness.</i>

15:50.817 --> 15:54.755
<i>I want it to be a day of happiness.
So I'm not even gonna talk about me.</i>

15:54.905 --> 15:59.326
<i>The only thing that's important
is that you know that I love you.</i>

15:59.476 --> 16:04.014
<i>And that... I have been
watching over you, always.</i>

16:04.564 --> 16:08.583
<i>Okay. So, enough of that sad shit.</i>

16:09.169 --> 16:14.041
<i>I told your father that I wanted him to
give you this tape on your 18th birthday.</i>

16:14.191 --> 16:18.512
<i>So for you, it is 2006.</i>

16:18.612 --> 16:20.385
<i>Happy Birthday!</i>

16:20.535 --> 16:23.119
<i>Happy Birthday, baby!</i>

16:23.282 --> 16:24.408
<i>I thought about having a cake,</i>

16:24.508 --> 16:28.755
<i>but explaining all this to Mrs. Davis
just would have been a little too weird.</i>

16:28.955 --> 16:33.444
<i>Mrs. Davis is our cook, and if she's there,
could you tell her I said hi?</i>

16:33.544 --> 16:37.982
<i>She's so sweet. That ought
to freak her out, though.</i>

16:38.632 --> 16:41.030
<i>She is scared of ghosts.</i>

16:44.137 --> 16:49.393
<i>Anyway, I wanted to make this tape
because I wanted you to get to know me.</i>

16:49.493 --> 16:52.663
<i>And I wanted to give
you a birthday gift,</i>

16:52.763 --> 16:55.198
<i>a birthday reading with my cards.</i>

16:55.298 --> 16:58.165
<i>I am really good at this.</i>

17:00.220 --> 17:05.006
<i>I'm always right. You can't cut
the deck, so this will have to do.</i>

17:05.777 --> 17:06.940
<i>Here we go.</i>

17:08.761 --> 17:11.012
I still have your bracelet, Mom.

17:12.982 --> 17:15.435
<i>Okay. So this is Death.</i>

17:15.689 --> 17:20.523
<i>But it doesn't mean "death" death.
It means transition.</i>

17:20.624 --> 17:24.509
<i>And this year, your 18th year,
is gonna be a year of transition.</i>

17:27.931 --> 17:31.351
<i>You know what it says here? It says
that you've never left St. Francis</i>

17:31.451 --> 17:33.377
<i>and that you're never gonna leave.</i>

17:33.477 --> 17:36.492
<i>Baby, you've gotta get out
there and see the world.</i>

17:36.592 --> 17:38.515
<i>There's so much great stuff out there.</i>

17:39.276 --> 17:43.797
<i>Suits of Cups. That's the water sign,
and water is pragmatic.</i>

17:43.897 --> 17:45.849
<i>It goes the way of least resistance.</i>

17:45.949 --> 17:48.955
<i>But this is a lot of water.
Are you a swimmer,</i>

17:49.055 --> 17:53.190
<i>- or do you do something with the sea?</i>
- I can't even swim.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.259
<i>You're a homebody, just like your mama.</i>

17:56.359 --> 17:58.945
Wrong again. You're terrible at this!

17:59.145 --> 18:01.848
<i>Well, it says here
that you're not alone.</i>

18:02.048 --> 18:05.268
<i>That there is a presence
in the house with you.</i>

18:05.518 --> 18:07.296
<i>It's not a bad thing.</i>

18:07.396 --> 18:10.113
<i>There are guardian angels everywhere.</i>

18:11.273 --> 18:13.111
<i>Maybe I'm seeing me.</i>

18:14.695 --> 18:17.595
<i>Yes, so she's a she. It's a female.</i>

18:24.237 --> 18:26.964
<i>She wants you out of the house.</i>

18:28.424 --> 18:29.724
<i>She says it's hers.</i>

18:36.366 --> 18:39.319
Jesus, Dad!
You scared the shit out of me!

18:39.419 --> 18:41.886
Where did you get that?

18:43.939 --> 18:47.074
I asked you a goddamn question!
I said, "Where did you get that?"

18:47.174 --> 18:49.444
I found it in my room, in Mom's room.

18:50.514 --> 18:52.830
Don't, Dad! Don't! What are you doing?

18:55.267 --> 18:58.889
Dad? Dad, what are you...
Dad, what are you doing?

18:58.989 --> 19:02.725
Oh! No, Dad. Oh, God, Dad.

19:02.825 --> 19:04.890
No more snooping around.

19:11.317 --> 19:14.652
Dad? Dad?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.400
Dad.

19:36.041 --> 19:36.987
Dad!

19:41.080 --> 19:42.753
Dad.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.879
<i>It's past your bedtime, sweetie.</i>

21:14.592 --> 21:18.759
<i>There is a presence
in the house with you.</i>

22:41.026 --> 22:42.110
Who are you?

22:46.148 --> 22:48.349
Jessabelle.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.988
I made... made breakfast.

23:33.963 --> 23:37.218
Look, I'm... I'm sorry about last night.

23:38.018 --> 23:41.832
I was a little drunk.
It's not gonna happen again.

23:42.571 --> 23:43.688
It's all right.

23:47.159 --> 23:48.794
That was your mother's old chair.

23:51.947 --> 23:54.198
It was out in the shed.

24:00.255 --> 24:02.009
Didn't expect to see
your mother last night.

24:02.709 --> 24:06.848
That tape, I didn't know
she made that tape,

24:07.229 --> 24:09.747
that she actually went through with it.

24:22.577 --> 24:24.328
You just found that one tape?

24:25.913 --> 24:27.014
Just one.

25:27.342 --> 25:28.876
<i>Hello, Jessabelle.</i>

25:30.562 --> 25:34.167
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you too, Mom.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.403
<i>It's been three weeks
since our last reading.</i>

25:37.503 --> 25:39.548
<i>There was so much weird stuff in there,</i>

25:39.648 --> 25:44.812
<i>so I asked Moses about it.
Not Ten Commandments Moses,</i>

25:44.912 --> 25:49.534
<i>but my friend Moses from
my church on Jerry's Creek.</i>

25:49.799 --> 25:52.850
<i>Don't tell Dad. He'd kill me.</i>

26:01.460 --> 26:04.488
<i>Moses taught me how to read cards.</i>

26:04.997 --> 26:09.735
<i>So I showed him your reading,
and he said something interesting.</i>

26:09.835 --> 26:15.441
<i>He said that the two presences
in the house, the two females,</i>

26:15.691 --> 26:17.674
<i>they're both you.</i>

26:19.294 --> 26:20.747
<i>You've been having nightmares, right?</i>

26:21.797 --> 26:26.286
<i>And when you see it,
this presence, it's broken, right?</i>

26:26.686 --> 26:29.589
<i>It's a demon, but it's an inner demon.</i>

26:29.889 --> 26:33.175
<i>You were in some sort
of accident or something,</i>

26:33.275 --> 26:35.595
<i>or maybe somebody you know was.</i>

26:35.795 --> 26:37.541
<i>Now, I want you to listen to me.</i>

26:37.791 --> 26:40.283
<i>It wasn't your fault.</i>

26:40.383 --> 26:42.312
<i>Stop blaming yourself, sweetheart.</i>

26:42.412 --> 26:45.516
<i>It wasn't your fault. Okay?</i>

26:46.522 --> 26:50.026
<i>Now that we know that's what
that last reading meant...</i>

26:50.126 --> 26:52.412
<i>I mean, that's what Moses says.</i>

26:52.512 --> 26:56.914
<i>So, we're gonna get you
a new one. All right.</i>

27:00.902 --> 27:05.506
<i>Death. That means transition.
You really don't have to worry about that.</i>

27:17.218 --> 27:19.737
<i>I see a very horrible death.</i>

27:52.771 --> 27:54.404
Dad?

28:08.519 --> 28:10.173
Miss Laurent?

28:10.623 --> 28:16.128
I was knocking, but I know you're
in a wheelchair, so I got in.

28:16.228 --> 28:18.698
Hi. It's just Jessie.

28:18.798 --> 28:21.333
The hospital told you
I was coming, right?

28:21.433 --> 28:25.437
No. Yes. Yes.

28:26.372 --> 28:29.074
You must be Miss Arlenna.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.732
Rosaura. You can call me Rosaura.

28:31.832 --> 28:35.078
- It's great to meet you.
- Let's get started.

28:38.099 --> 28:41.444
Okay. Okay.

28:41.544 --> 28:43.846
You feel good?

28:46.391 --> 28:49.009
I'll be back and check on you, okay?

30:54.986 --> 30:57.120
No, no!

31:04.028 --> 31:05.665
Dad!

31:07.465 --> 31:09.531
Dad! No!

31:18.978 --> 31:20.777
What the hell's going on?

31:25.800 --> 31:28.254
Just calm down. Settle down.

31:28.954 --> 31:31.421
It's nothing. It's nothing.

31:38.362 --> 31:39.899
Where the hell were you?

31:39.999 --> 31:43.302
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Mr. Laurent.
It was only five minutes.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.387
Get out! Now.

31:45.495 --> 31:47.237
- Get out!
- I'm sorry.

31:49.941 --> 31:53.846
What did you mean by "nothing", Dad?
What's nothing?

31:54.446 --> 31:57.751
- What are you doing?
- It's her goddamn tapes!

31:58.551 --> 32:00.936
She's got you scared out of your mind.
I told her not to do this.

32:01.036 --> 32:04.056
But, Dad, it's Mom.
It's all I have of her!

32:04.406 --> 32:07.224
That thing on these tapes
is not your mother.

32:08.893 --> 32:11.898
Five weeks into her pregnancy,
we found out she had tumors in her brain.

32:12.348 --> 32:16.152
She wouldn't do chemo. Nothing.
Nothing to help herself.

32:16.452 --> 32:20.522
It ate her mind, the cancer.
It just wasn't her anymore.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.842
But, Dad, I want to watch them!

32:22.942 --> 32:26.212
Why? So she can scare the
shit out of you some more?

32:26.662 --> 32:28.898
- I'm gonna burn these tapes.
- Dad, no!

32:29.548 --> 32:33.482
No, Dad! Don't, Dad! Dad!

33:24.952 --> 33:26.335
Dad.

33:32.194 --> 33:33.410
Oh, God!

33:40.718 --> 33:43.185
Dad! Dad!

33:45.840 --> 33:47.791
Jessie!

33:49.159 --> 33:50.360
Jessie!

33:51.362 --> 33:55.432
No! Dad! Dad!

34:05.810 --> 34:10.348
Goodbye, Leon. May your soul
finally find peace. Thank you.

34:26.914 --> 34:28.016
Hey, Jessie.

34:28.851 --> 34:30.417
Preston.

34:32.402 --> 34:33.473
How you been?

34:35.641 --> 34:37.092
That was a really stupid question.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.447
I heard you were in town last week.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.350
I would have come over,
but I figured I should call first.

34:44.449 --> 34:46.585
I tried you a few times,
but no one picked up.

34:46.685 --> 34:50.222
I'm sorry. My Dad's phone is upstairs,

34:50.322 --> 34:53.793
and it's gonna be a few more weeks
before I can walk upstairs to answer it.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.579
Right. I'm sorry.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.162
It's really good to see you, Preston.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.199
It's good to see you, too.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.106
I'm really sorry about your dad.

35:15.813 --> 35:17.180
Jessie?

35:24.506 --> 35:26.678
Jessie, you okay?

36:32.740 --> 36:34.324
Hey.

36:36.160 --> 36:39.328
- Morning.
- Good morning.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.785
You stayed here all night?

36:43.185 --> 36:46.319
Yeah, well, I figured I'd stick around,
make sure you're okay.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.408
Thanks. You didn't have to.

36:54.078 --> 36:58.417
Well, I guess I should get going home.

36:58.667 --> 37:02.487
But I'd love to see you again, though.
Be okay if I come by some other time?

37:02.587 --> 37:05.321
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like that.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.594
- All right. You take care.
- Wait, wait.

37:14.115 --> 37:16.032
Please don't go.

37:16.934 --> 37:17.654
What?

37:18.404 --> 37:21.956
If I don't talk to somebody,
I'm gonna go crazy.

37:22.056 --> 37:26.376
- Maybe I already am crazy.
- Okay. I don't gotta go anywhere.

37:27.728 --> 37:30.049
- I'll stay right here.
- Thank you.

37:30.299 --> 37:33.199
But you think we can get
the hell out of this place?

37:33.619 --> 37:35.301
Kind of gives me the creeps.

37:36.536 --> 37:37.654
Yeah.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.467
Pretty much everybody's still here.

37:46.865 --> 37:51.737
Rick Foster just got back from Afghanistan.
But he's going back, I think.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.478
He's still married to Shawna.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.373
If I was married to Shawna,
I'd be going back, too.

37:59.678 --> 38:02.598
Mary Kimball's been married
and divorced twice.

38:02.698 --> 38:04.917
- Twice?
- She's got three kids.

38:05.317 --> 38:08.801
Lives in that new subdivision
over by the quarry.

38:14.425 --> 38:15.899
The quarry.

38:16.664 --> 38:18.349
So, the quarry's still there?

38:19.413 --> 38:22.217
Yes, well, you know,
it is a big, giant hole.

38:22.317 --> 38:25.685
- You can't really move a big, giant hole.
- Smart ass. Cut me some slack.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.273
Yeah.

38:28.473 --> 38:32.242
Nothing's changed, really.
Marriages and mortgages.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.980
I can see why you couldn't
get out fast enough.

38:38.533 --> 38:39.873
Preston, I'm...

38:41.076 --> 38:42.732
I'm so sorry.

38:43.220 --> 38:46.025
Hey, you don't gotta explain to me.

38:46.125 --> 38:49.461
If I'd gotten into college, I would've
left this town and never looked back.

38:49.561 --> 38:51.430
Never would have
given it a second thought.

38:51.530 --> 38:54.550
That's not true. I thought
about this place a lot.

38:55.200 --> 38:58.763
I missed you.
I'm sorry I didn't call more.

38:59.271 --> 39:01.874
I just wanted a clean
breakaway, I guess.

39:02.374 --> 39:05.144
But me leaving never had
anything to do with you.

39:06.044 --> 39:09.293
It's okay. I understand.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.866
How have you been?

39:19.507 --> 39:20.693
Married.

39:24.063 --> 39:26.215
Where did she think you were last night?

39:26.615 --> 39:29.501
Oh, I told her the truth.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.419
I told her I was with a Make-A-Wish kid.

39:40.911 --> 39:42.678
So tell me what's going on.

39:43.378 --> 39:45.520
You seemed so scared back there.

39:45.820 --> 39:49.505
Okay. I've been having nightmares.

39:50.005 --> 39:51.857
I've been having really bad dreams,

39:52.057 --> 39:56.282
and they're so real that
I think I'm going crazy.

39:59.597 --> 40:03.869
I dreamed there's this girl.
She looks dead,

40:04.469 --> 40:08.273
and she's trying to get me, kill me.

40:08.573 --> 40:12.010
And there's this man. It looks
like he's been burnt to death,

40:12.260 --> 40:15.664
and he looks at me like I did it.

40:15.764 --> 40:18.134
Like whatever happened
to him, it was my fault.

40:18.734 --> 40:21.520
Well, after everything
you've been through,

40:21.620 --> 40:23.689
it would be weird if you weren't
having nightmares, right?

40:23.989 --> 40:27.927
- Have you thought about seeing a shrink?
- I can't afford it.

40:28.227 --> 40:32.130
I mean, if I had any money at all,
I wouldn't have come home to live with Dad.

40:32.230 --> 40:36.482
I'm flat broke.
And there are these tapes.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.785
<i>Now that we know that's what
that last reading meant...</i>

40:53.385 --> 40:58.421
<i>I mean, that's what Moses says.
So, we're gonna get you a new one.</i>

41:01.642 --> 41:04.162
I really don't think you should
be watching these anymore.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.248
It's no wonder why
you're having nightmares.

41:07.348 --> 41:08.383
It's not good for you.

41:08.483 --> 41:13.104
Would you watch them if it was your mom?
Your only chance to get to know her?

41:13.204 --> 41:16.642
Yeah, I would, but I'd wait,
wait until I was recuperated.

41:16.742 --> 41:19.375
Not when I was still
stuck in this house...

41:19.475 --> 41:22.509
where she died. I mean, it's just...

41:22.609 --> 41:24.165
it's just weird.

41:24.265 --> 41:27.085
And besides, she's wrong
more than she's right.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.905
She said you never left town,
you love to swim.

41:30.005 --> 41:33.174
- She said Dad was gonna die.
- No, she thought you were gonna die.

41:33.274 --> 41:35.927
She said 10 things that were wrong,

41:36.027 --> 41:39.298
and you picked one
that was almost right.

41:39.398 --> 41:42.388
Jessie, she didn't predict
your dad's death.

41:42.488 --> 41:46.119
She thought she saw your death,
and she was wrong about everything.

41:49.540 --> 41:53.611
Now, look, I've been thinking about
your dreams. That girl you keep seeing,

41:54.912 --> 41:58.133
it's you. And the guy
that burnt in the fire,

41:58.233 --> 42:01.157
you're having a nightmare
about your accident.

42:04.122 --> 42:07.440
Shit, that's my wife.
I'm sorry, but I've gotta go.

42:09.059 --> 42:13.482
Here. That's my work cell.
It's got my home phone number on it.

42:13.582 --> 42:17.850
You call me any time,
day or night, all right?

42:18.669 --> 42:20.569
- Promise?
- Okay.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.940
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.330
Thank you, Preston.

42:30.430 --> 42:34.354
Yeah, of course. Now you take care.

44:23.694 --> 44:26.629
<i>This is beautiful South Louisiana.</i>

44:28.282 --> 44:32.171
<i>And here is the belle
of South Louisiana.</i>

44:32.271 --> 44:35.407
<i>That's right. Here she is.</i>

44:35.507 --> 44:38.274
<i>I'm gonna send this... I'm gonna
send this to Mr. Hugh Hefner,</i>

44:38.374 --> 44:41.275
<i>and I'm gonna make me some money on
the side. The most beautiful woman</i>

44:41.376 --> 44:43.249
<i>- in South Louisiana.
- Bad.</i>

44:44.099 --> 44:47.086
<i>This is the family portrait.
Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

44:47.186 --> 44:49.988
<i>I might just send me some
tapes to that Mr. Hugh Hefner.</i>

44:50.088 --> 44:51.807
<i>These bugs are eating my ass up!</i>

44:51.907 --> 44:54.576
<i>Let's see those feet. Where'd they go?</i>

44:54.676 --> 44:55.961
<i>There it is.</i>

44:56.161 --> 44:58.063
<i>- Oh! There she is.
- Baby!</i>

44:58.163 --> 45:00.882
<i>Hey, baby, you can't
improve perfection. Look at that.</i>

45:00.982 --> 45:03.852
<i>- What are you doing?
- Recording for posterity.</i>

45:03.952 --> 45:06.872
<i>Those who don't remember the
past are doomed to repeat it.</i>

45:06.972 --> 45:12.377
<i>- Okay, well, let's go into the future.</i>
<i>- Merry Christmas! Yeah!</i>

45:12.477 --> 45:14.396
<i>Now, listen, I want to
show you how to use it.</i>

45:14.496 --> 45:16.915
<i>You just take it,
point it, and shoot it.</i>

45:17.015 --> 45:19.635
<i>You got it? Okay, you got it?
Just hold it.</i>

45:19.835 --> 45:22.304
<i>- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!</i>

45:22.404 --> 45:24.622
<i>Mrs. Davis, I think these
people are about ready to eat.</i>

45:24.722 --> 45:27.392
<i>They're gonna eat the furniture if we
don't sit them down and feed them.</i>

45:27.492 --> 45:30.228
<i>- I'm gonna do the thing.
- What? Okay.</i>

45:30.328 --> 45:32.595
<i>Let's work with this, okay?</i>

45:33.765 --> 45:38.670
<i>Excuse me. Before you unwrap the
presents and get into some funky music,</i>

45:38.770 --> 45:40.805
<i>I just wanted to take a little
second here to brag about something.</i>

45:40.905 --> 45:43.825
<i>- Oh, yeah, surprise.
- How very unlike you, Leon.</i>

45:43.925 --> 45:47.696
<i>Now wait a minute. Now wait a minute.
It has come to my attention</i>

45:47.796 --> 45:52.984
<i>that my lovely,
devoted wife is with child.</i>

45:53.334 --> 45:55.484
<i>I'm pregnant!</i>

45:57.622 --> 46:00.775
<i>Raise your glasses and
toast to Leon and Kate!</i>

46:00.875 --> 46:03.125
<i>- Congratulations.
- I can drink.</i>

46:41.064 --> 46:43.799
<i>You're already dead, Jessabelle.</i>

46:51.175 --> 46:53.042
<i>You're already dead!</i>

47:14.348 --> 47:15.679
Preston? I'm sorry.

47:15.780 --> 47:18.801
- I know I said I wouldn't call, but...
<i>- Who is this?</i>

47:21.540 --> 47:24.669
It's Jessie, Jessie Laurent.

47:24.769 --> 47:26.769
Who is this?

48:43.053 --> 48:46.388
<i>Come closer.</i>

48:55.799 --> 48:57.966
<i>Closer.</i>

49:07.744 --> 49:09.051
<i>Yes.</i>

50:32.195 --> 50:34.363
Hey. You all right?

50:35.382 --> 50:36.795
Sam just told me you called last night.

50:38.086 --> 50:40.939
I'm all right. I'm so sorry.

50:41.039 --> 50:44.340
I just... I just got scared.

50:46.393 --> 50:47.703
Everything okay at home?

50:48.830 --> 50:52.097
Well, "okay" is stretching
it a bit, but I'm fine.

50:52.782 --> 50:56.085
- Well, I'm glad you're here.
- All right. Well, tell me what happened.

51:02.109 --> 51:04.163
Oh, you see that, too?

51:04.263 --> 51:05.885
Yeah.

51:08.965 --> 51:09.999
What is that?

51:11.102 --> 51:13.969
I don't know.
I think somebody's out there.

51:15.589 --> 51:17.775
There was somebody definitely
out there last night.

51:18.175 --> 51:19.994
You think that old boat still works?

51:20.644 --> 51:22.140
Sure.

51:59.162 --> 52:01.242
What is that?

52:01.836 --> 52:04.239
Some kind of voodoo or something.

52:04.339 --> 52:07.676
Half the cemeteries in this parish
are full of that kind of shit.

52:08.376 --> 52:10.326
But why would they put it on our land?

52:51.769 --> 52:55.537
Yeah, someone's definitely
been out here, all right.

52:59.326 --> 53:00.626
That's pretty fresh.

53:12.823 --> 53:13.906
What?

53:17.927 --> 53:20.410
There's something down there.

53:21.949 --> 53:23.533
What is that?

53:25.502 --> 53:28.921
- What are you doing?
- This isn't my first time in the bayou.

53:56.714 --> 53:57.734
That's weird.

54:22.892 --> 54:24.877
That's my birthday.

54:29.499 --> 54:32.568
Why would someone want
to spook you like this?

54:37.307 --> 54:39.410
Or maybe that's a real gravestone.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.930
Maybe you had a twin
sister or something.

54:43.030 --> 54:47.201
I never had a sister. And why
would we both have the same name?

54:47.351 --> 54:51.319
I don't know. I've got cousins with
two Beauregards in their family.

54:52.139 --> 54:53.574
They just like the name.

54:54.725 --> 54:59.177
But who killed that chicken?
And who brings flowers?

55:01.815 --> 55:03.799
Do you think there's
something under that stone?

55:09.572 --> 55:10.687
All right.

55:11.409 --> 55:14.031
I guess we'll go back to your house and
see what kind of tools you've got.

56:25.799 --> 56:29.918
You don't recall any mention of your
parents having another little girl?

56:34.307 --> 56:37.025
Well, you were right to call us.

56:38.178 --> 56:41.081
I suspect it was a stillbirth.

56:41.181 --> 56:44.135
We'll run some tests, find out
if she was a relative of yours

56:44.235 --> 56:46.120
based on your DNA sample.

56:46.220 --> 56:50.074
Of course we have a sample of your
daddy already from his autopsy.

56:50.174 --> 56:53.127
So we'll give you a call when we
find out who this infant was.

56:53.227 --> 56:56.815
Thank you, Sheriff. We knew
we had to call you right away.

56:57.865 --> 57:01.970
Remind me again the nature of
your relationship with Miss Laurent.

57:03.070 --> 57:05.487
We're old friends from high school.

57:06.890 --> 57:09.417
Y'all have a good night, then.

57:10.677 --> 57:11.805
Thank you, Sheriff.

57:18.234 --> 57:21.056
You know you can't stay here, right?

57:21.756 --> 57:24.252
I've got nowhere else to go.

57:25.975 --> 57:27.588
Yeah, you do.

57:40.790 --> 57:42.691
- You all right?
- Yeah.

57:50.867 --> 57:52.234
Hey, honey.

57:55.439 --> 57:57.931
Hey, Sam, this is Jessie.

57:58.131 --> 58:00.856
Jessie, this is Sam, my wife.

58:03.413 --> 58:05.716
It's almost 1:00 a.m.
I gotta work tomorrow.

58:06.116 --> 58:07.785
Yeah, I know.

58:08.085 --> 58:12.440
This is my fault. I'm so sorry. I'm the
one who dragged him all into this.

58:12.540 --> 58:15.075
We don't have an extra room.
Hope the couch is okay for you.

58:15.925 --> 58:17.345
Yeah, it's fine.

58:17.895 --> 58:21.163
- I need to get to bed.
- Thank...

58:27.187 --> 58:28.197
I'm sorry about that.

58:33.559 --> 58:35.544
- Undo these.
- Yeah.

58:41.201 --> 58:44.419
- Okay, now.
- Yeah, thanks.

58:46.706 --> 58:47.695
All right.

58:49.343 --> 58:52.060
Well, just let me know if
you need anything else.

58:54.931 --> 58:56.731
Thank you.

58:57.216 --> 58:58.834
Night.

59:14.967 --> 59:16.989
I'm sorry for getting you
in trouble last night.

59:17.572 --> 59:19.899
That's all right.

59:19.999 --> 59:21.717
That's what old friends are for.

59:22.193 --> 59:25.890
You're just lucky you were asleep
when she left for work this morning.

59:26.864 --> 59:27.925
I see.

59:28.666 --> 59:31.168
Yeah. So why do you
wanna go to Woodbury?

59:31.268 --> 59:33.971
Well, I think there's somebody who
might know who that baby girl is.

59:34.071 --> 59:37.208
- Do you remember Scott Davis from school?
- Yeah, I remember him.

59:37.308 --> 59:41.862
His mom, Abbey, used to cook for my
mom and dad back before I was born.

59:41.962 --> 59:45.180
Well, if she's still alive,
I'll take you there.

59:52.288 --> 59:55.415
Excuse me, sir. Abigail Davis live here?

59:57.610 --> 59:59.160
Thank you.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:08.887
Mrs. Davis?

01:00:11.958 --> 01:00:13.308
Hey, Mrs. Davis.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:16.155
I used to go to school
with your son, Scott.

01:00:17.748 --> 01:00:20.156
It's Preston. Remember me?

01:00:20.256 --> 01:00:22.618
Me and Scott used to play
together when we were little.

01:00:22.718 --> 01:00:26.721
You used to yell at us for jumping
off your garage. Remember?

01:00:32.729 --> 01:00:34.429
Preston Saunders.

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:39.451
You're gonna break your arm up there,
and I'm gonna laugh my ass off.

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:45.476
It's good to see you, Mrs. Davis.
It's been a long time.

01:00:45.776 --> 01:00:49.313
There's someone else here to see you.
This is Jessie. Jessie Laurent.

01:00:49.413 --> 01:00:51.463
You used to cook for her folks.

01:00:54.450 --> 01:00:55.650
Jessie Laurent?

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.856
Jessabelle!

01:01:15.688 --> 01:01:17.471
Mrs. Davis.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:24.798
- God, is she all right?
- What did she say?

01:01:25.048 --> 01:01:27.046
- I don't know.
- She say...

01:01:28.165 --> 01:01:30.536
"Rain wet us, Mama.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:34.692
"Sun dried us, Papa.
"The betrayers are evil.

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:38.496
"Call down Djowou. Call down
Djowou will deal with them."

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:40.398
What's that mean?

01:01:40.998 --> 01:01:43.901
It's an old song from Haiti.

01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:47.469
They sing it to call the
spirits to possess someone.

01:01:50.323 --> 01:01:52.997
Tell Moses Jessabelle get
what's coming to her!

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.646
You okay?

01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:09.552
Goddamn voodoo shit.

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:13.829
I always hated Scott's mom.

01:02:15.898 --> 01:02:18.569
Jessie, don't worry.
It's just some crazy old lady.

01:02:18.669 --> 01:02:20.688
Probably says shit
like that all the time.

01:02:21.138 --> 01:02:24.892
What does that mean "they call the
spirits to get possessed"? On purpose?

01:02:24.992 --> 01:02:28.259
Well, yeah. In voodoo,
possession ain't a bad thing.

01:02:28.944 --> 01:02:31.081
- What?
- Yeah, it's part of their ceremonies.

01:02:31.181 --> 01:02:34.652
You call down the spirits,
and they possess you,

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:36.654
and you dance around.
That's what they do.

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:37.979
How do you know that?

01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.860
Come on, you grew up here, too.
There's voodoo all around this place.

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:44.795
They really get possessed?

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:48.165
Well, that depends on who you ask.
I think it's like hypnosis.

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.334
You know, like faith-healing,
speaking in tongues.

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:53.804
If you're raised to believe that,
that's what you're gonna think is real.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:56.891
Plus they've got drums going,
people dancing around.

01:02:57.091 --> 01:02:59.310
They rub blood on you.
You think you're possessed.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:03.314
"Moses". She said, "Tell Moses."

01:03:03.414 --> 01:03:05.940
I don't know. Voodoo mixes
all kinds of religions,

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.369
Catholic, African.
It's all the same to them.

01:03:08.469 --> 01:03:12.422
No, my mom knew a Moses.
She said that on the tape.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:15.993
She learned tarot cards
from Moses at her church.

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:19.110
I think her church was somewhere
out near Jerry's Creek.

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:40.932
God damn it.

01:03:42.135 --> 01:03:45.987
Well, I guess you get to see
my patented 175-point turn.

01:03:47.924 --> 01:03:51.125
No, wait, wait, wait. What's that?

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:17.385
"Moses Harper.

01:04:17.685 --> 01:04:20.312
"Born December 12th, 1952.

01:04:20.612 --> 01:04:23.241
"Died June 12th, 1988."

01:04:26.598 --> 01:04:28.330
What the hell is going on?

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:34.154
"Legba, open the gate.
Legba, let Moses back in."

01:04:34.254 --> 01:04:35.870
Get out.

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.163
I'm Preston. This here is my friend...

01:04:47.517 --> 01:04:50.198
- Let's go, Preston.
- Look, now, we don't want any trouble.

01:04:53.173 --> 01:04:54.572
Hey! Stop it!

01:04:58.744 --> 01:04:59.611
Wait!

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.831
- Preston, you all right?
- Go!

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:28.273
You're not coming back here.

01:05:29.642 --> 01:05:32.312
- Ever. There's no way.
- Preston...

01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:34.295
You're not gonna stay here.

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:40.764
You go in. Get whatever you need.
You can stay with us again.

01:05:41.321 --> 01:05:43.150
Your wife's gonna be
thrilled about that.

01:05:46.258 --> 01:05:48.009
You could stay at my mom's.

01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:52.175
My mom always liked you.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:54.428
You know that.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:58.216
She's still got our prom pictures up.

01:05:58.856 --> 01:06:01.923
That's another reason why
Sam's not so crazy about you.

01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:07.895
She knows... she knows
I still think about you.

01:06:11.851 --> 01:06:13.939
And she knows we're
probably gonna move on.

01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:18.376
But you didn't do it, Jessie.
Not you showing up right now.

01:06:19.026 --> 01:06:20.859
It's just weird timing is all.

01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:39.344
All right. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

01:06:42.548 --> 01:06:44.031
Ready?

01:06:44.667 --> 01:06:45.934
Yeah.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:12.293
Excuse me.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:20.103
- All right, let's get you packed.
- Would you grab me that bag?

01:07:20.203 --> 01:07:21.536
Yeah.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.074
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.217
I'll get this over here.

01:07:51.884 --> 01:07:53.315
Preston?

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.236
All right.

01:07:57.683 --> 01:07:59.531
Be right back.

01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.488
Hey, you ready?

01:08:19.038 --> 01:08:20.267
All right.

01:08:52.478 --> 01:08:53.995
Preston?

01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:50.785
Preston?

01:09:55.226 --> 01:09:56.133
Preston!

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:16.079
Your boyfriend is in shock,
but his blood pressure is okay.

01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:19.267
He should be fine when he comes to,
but they're running him to the hospital

01:10:19.367 --> 01:10:22.028
- just to be safe.
- He's not my boyfriend.

01:10:22.128 --> 01:10:24.804
We were just friends from high school.

01:10:24.904 --> 01:10:27.854
Miss Laurent, do you mind telling
me what the hell's going on here?

01:10:32.361 --> 01:10:35.365
We don't have the results
back on the DNA yet.

01:10:35.715 --> 01:10:39.619
But that infant we found,
we do know was a female.

01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:42.055
The date on her gravestone
was probably about right.

01:10:42.155 --> 01:10:44.130
Well, then was she a stillborn?

01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:48.797
No, she wasn't. She was born alive.
They know that.

01:10:49.397 --> 01:10:50.945
Then she was murdered.

01:10:52.364 --> 01:10:54.351
- What?
- From the nature of the fractures

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:57.671
and the splintering of the vertebrae,
it seems like somebody just picked her up

01:10:57.771 --> 01:11:01.135
and snapped her over his
knee like a piece of firewood.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.030
She was murdered.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:15.038
Miss Laurent, I don't know what
the hell is going on around here,

01:11:15.138 --> 01:11:18.942
but clearly, you are one
very frightened young woman.

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:22.527
- She doesn't want to hurt us.
- What?

01:11:23.329 --> 01:11:25.392
She needs our help.

01:11:25.492 --> 01:11:26.886
Who?

01:11:27.801 --> 01:11:32.219
Sheriff, would you mind calling me
when Preston wakes up, please?

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.227
All right.

01:11:37.127 --> 01:11:39.696
Please call me when
you know he's all right.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.496
All right.

01:11:49.154 --> 01:11:50.855
I know you were murdered.

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:58.012
What are you trying to tell me?

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.483
Who were you?

01:12:26.542 --> 01:12:29.510
Please, I wanna help you.

01:12:39.037 --> 01:12:40.801
Who are you?

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:45.336
<i>Jessabelle.</i>

01:12:52.851 --> 01:12:55.336
What do you want from me?

01:13:03.078 --> 01:13:05.615
Hello? Hello?

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:09.086
<i>It's Sheriff Pruitt.
Your boyfriend's come to.</i>

01:13:09.186 --> 01:13:11.337
<i>He seems all right.
I thought you'd wanna know.</i>

01:13:11.437 --> 01:13:14.341
- Oh, he's all right?
<i>- The paramedics said he should rest.</i>

01:13:14.441 --> 01:13:17.061
<i>He won't even go to the
hospital for an exam.</i>

01:13:17.161 --> 01:13:20.447
<i>He wants me to take him back out to the
house to protect you from something.</i>

01:13:20.547 --> 01:13:24.968
<i>- That you know what that is.</i>
- Sheriff? Sheriff, I can barely hear you.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:29.756
<i>Miss Laurent, we also just got the
results back from the DNA test.</i>

01:13:29.856 --> 01:13:34.094
<i>That deceased baby girl
that you dug up was black.</i>

01:13:34.194 --> 01:13:36.393
What did you say? She was black?

01:13:37.330 --> 01:13:41.168
I don't understand. Does that
mean she was my half-sister?

01:13:41.268 --> 01:13:46.019
<i>They crossed your DNA with
your father's, with Leon's...</i>

01:13:46.755 --> 01:13:47.616
What?

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:13.748
<i>That's you crying.</i>

01:14:18.504 --> 01:14:22.209
<i>You're crying 'cause you're scared.</i>

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.886
<i>You don't know where you are.</i>

01:14:24.986 --> 01:14:27.662
<i>You don't know who you are.</i>

01:14:27.762 --> 01:14:29.482
<i>You don't know shit!</i>

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:39.261
<i>I'm gonna tell you who you are.</i>

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:42.529
<i>Because that's what good mothers do.</i>

01:14:42.729 --> 01:14:44.202
<i>Jessabelle, you're dead.</i>

01:14:45.367 --> 01:14:47.770
<i>Your father's dead.</i>

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:50.384
<i>Moses.</i>

01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:58.169
<i>Hush-a-bye</i>

01:14:59.347 --> 01:15:02.252
<i>Don't you cry</i>

01:15:02.652 --> 01:15:07.383
<i>Go to sleepy, little baby</i>

01:15:07.683 --> 01:15:09.550
<i>When you wake</i>

01:15:09.900 --> 01:15:12.868
<i>You shall have...</i>

01:15:14.604 --> 01:15:18.613
<i>All the pretty little horses</i>

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:26.662
<i>No, it's all gonna be
all right, isn't it?</i>

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:33.447
<i>I need you, sugar.
I need you. Good girl.</i>

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:40.301
<i>You're gonna come back.
I'm gonna hold the door open for you.</i>

01:15:47.926 --> 01:15:51.178
<i>Jessabelle, you're gonna
get what's coming to you!</i>

01:16:09.231 --> 01:16:11.035
The unwanted presence in the house.

01:16:11.835 --> 01:16:15.911
<i>- When you see it, it's broken, right?</i>
- It wasn't the ghost. It was me.

01:16:22.594 --> 01:16:25.065
<i>You were telling someone
else's fortune, weren't you?</i>

01:16:25.165 --> 01:16:28.401
<i>You know what it says here? It says
that you've never left St. Francis</i>

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:31.022
<i>and that you're never gonna leave.</i>

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:34.754
Your real daughter, not me.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:39.614
You gave your life for Jessabelle.

01:16:39.814 --> 01:16:44.053
Didn't do chemo.
But when the baby was born,

01:16:45.417 --> 01:16:47.001
it wasn't Dad's.

01:16:59.394 --> 01:17:00.881
No, no!

01:17:02.501 --> 01:17:03.957
He killed her, didn't he?

01:17:18.417 --> 01:17:21.460
<i>Moses taught me how to read cards.</i>

01:17:24.256 --> 01:17:25.909
Look at those.

01:17:26.009 --> 01:17:29.059
<i>Don't tell Dad. He'd kill me.</i>

01:17:45.462 --> 01:17:49.746
So Leon adopted a baby girl...
to cover the crime?

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:54.248
A white girl, me.

01:18:05.213 --> 01:18:06.621
Your church...

01:18:07.483 --> 01:18:08.635
Moses' church.

01:18:08.735 --> 01:18:10.277
Get out.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.531
They gave her the grave.

01:18:46.438 --> 01:18:48.088
What do you want from me?

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:54.828
What can I do?

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:01.902
Moses.

01:19:11.296 --> 01:19:14.047
- What are you doing?
- Payback.

01:19:14.733 --> 01:19:15.549
What?

01:19:18.108 --> 01:19:19.528
What?

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:25.192
No! No. It's not my fault!

01:19:26.528 --> 01:19:28.378
Somebody!

01:19:30.082 --> 01:19:31.432
Help!

01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:33.763
No!

01:19:35.064 --> 01:19:36.535
What do you want from me?

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.756
All Jessabelle wants is
what's coming to her.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.563
Somebody!

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:47.503
No! No!

01:19:48.967 --> 01:19:50.968
Let me go!

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:02.713
What is... No, no, no!

01:20:04.582 --> 01:20:05.716
No!

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:16.693
Please, stop.

01:20:17.178 --> 01:20:19.196
Where are you taking me?

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:23.795
No, God! Please.

01:20:27.472 --> 01:20:28.579
Please!

01:20:36.347 --> 01:20:37.209
Jessie!

01:20:38.299 --> 01:20:42.035
Please! Let me go!

01:20:45.657 --> 01:20:49.676
No! God! Stop it!

01:22:26.091 --> 01:22:29.142
Oh, my God! Hold on. Hold on.

01:22:33.999 --> 01:22:35.849
You all right?

01:22:38.436 --> 01:22:40.487
I thought I lost you.

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:58.160
Take me home, my love.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.995
Miss Laurent? Are you all right?

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:23.576
Miss Laurent!

01:23:24.984 --> 01:23:26.950
It's Jessabelle.
