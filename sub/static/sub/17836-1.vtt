00:00.001 --> 00:02.368
<i> Previously on</i> teen wolf...

00:02.370 --> 00:03.602
You don't
remember me, do you?

00:03.604 --> 00:03.602
Theo?

00:03.604 --> 00:03.602
<i> Theo was a first step</i>

00:03.604 --> 00:07.473
<i> in the right direction</i>
<i> for the dread doctors.</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:09.174
They called him
<i> der soldat.</i>

00:09.176 --> 00:11.810
He was a Nazi.
And an Alpha werewolf.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.645
Theo, your sister
wants to see you.

00:14.781 --> 00:15.848
Help me!

00:15.850 --> 00:17.316
You're going to die
if you stay.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.751
Shut up and let me
save your life.

00:18.753 --> 00:20.419
<i> Stiles saved me.</i>

00:54.254 --> 00:55.354
What?

00:58.391 --> 01:00.359
Nothin'.

01:03.129 --> 01:07.099
We should have
taken my car. Like I said.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.867
Several times.

01:08.869 --> 01:10.169
It's a new car.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.704
It was new to someone.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.306
About twenty years ago.

01:22.982 --> 01:25.484
There's no Jack.

01:30.990 --> 01:33.225
Grab the spare.

01:37.997 --> 01:39.331
No spare?

01:39.732 --> 01:40.799
No spare.

01:43.870 --> 01:46.305
I know.
Worst date ever.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.740
We've had worse.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.008
Remember the double date?

01:50.010 --> 01:51.143
What about new year's?

01:51.145 --> 01:53.011
Christmas
with your parents.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.213
That time
your sister...

01:54.215 --> 01:56.014
Please don't say it.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.655
Actually, this could be
our best date yet.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.513
It must be
the northern lights.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.518
Hmm. Maybe
they've got a spare.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.551
Oh, hey!

03:41.655 --> 03:43.622
Don't let them take me!

03:46.259 --> 03:48.660
Don't let
them take me too.

04:07.313 --> 04:12.751
What in the hell
were you two thinking?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.653
We were just
trying to help.

04:14.655 --> 04:17.055
Why don't you try
and help me understand...

04:17.057 --> 04:18.656
...what the hell
happened here?

04:18.659 --> 04:22.094
Right, well, we were
trying to gently persuade
him to pull over...

04:22.096 --> 04:23.495
Yeah...

04:24.597 --> 04:26.832
Demon!

04:29.002 --> 04:30.202
He was getting away.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.204
He got away.

04:32.206 --> 04:34.840
Right. Because obviously
he's some sort of criminal
mastermind, dad.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.976
Uh-huh. You want to
guess what the stolen
merchandise is?

04:40.647 --> 04:41.813
Hmm?

04:44.183 --> 04:46.184
Critical life-saving
medical equipment?

04:46.186 --> 04:47.586
No.
Poison gas?

04:47.588 --> 04:49.121
Nope.

04:49.123 --> 04:50.555
Filled with drugs?

04:51.524 --> 04:52.824
Helium.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.059
Helium?

04:57.196 --> 04:58.664
This could
be a good thing.

05:00.767 --> 05:02.134
That we saved helium?

05:04.170 --> 05:05.804
I mean, that...

05:08.274 --> 05:09.741
They don't need us
anymore.

05:09.743 --> 05:12.377
Okay, well, they need us.
They just don't know it.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.779
We're all going
off to college soon.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.014
So beacon hills
is gonna have to
survive without us.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.717
Beacon hills will burn to
the ground without us.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.018
Stiles...

05:20.953 --> 05:22.621
They don't need us.

05:31.364 --> 05:32.664
They need us!

05:35.068 --> 05:38.704
Alex, you know
we're having trouble
locating your parents.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.440
And since you can't
remember anything,

05:41.442 --> 05:44.276
we have a method,

05:44.278 --> 05:47.145
an unusual method that
might help you remember.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.014
But I need you
to be okay with it.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.917
I also need you
to know that it's
probably gonna hurt.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.986
I don't care. I just want
to find my mom and dad.

06:04.664 --> 06:05.797
You ready?

06:22.750 --> 06:26.318
I told you we shouldn't
have taken him
to an r-rated movie.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.153
I wasn't scared.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.721
Well, I was terrified.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.823
Maybe we shouldn't take
me to r-rated movies.

06:34.361 --> 06:37.562
You weren't scared?
Not even just a little?

06:38.431 --> 06:39.731
Maybe a little.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.099
Will, drive!

07:15.369 --> 07:16.735
Drive!

07:17.804 --> 07:18.937
Get down!

07:29.950 --> 07:31.149
Ah!

07:50.803 --> 07:51.703
What'd you see?

07:51.705 --> 07:53.371
I saw a guy on a horse.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.240
Horse?
He had a gun.

07:55.242 --> 07:58.109
Okay, a guy with a gun.
That sounds like
my department, not yours.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.845
What about his parents?
What happened to them?

07:59.847 --> 08:02.514
I don't know. That's all
i remember. But...

08:03.483 --> 08:05.250
I got this feeling.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.952
What kind of feeling?

08:06.954 --> 08:08.053
They're coming back.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.191
They're coming for me.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.156
Hmm.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.091
What?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.861
This is a perfect shade
for me. Forget the name.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.863
Can we please
stay on topic here?

09:26.699 --> 09:28.600
I'm not
getting anything.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.860
I don't think
they're dead.

09:55.862 --> 09:59.297
They're dead.
Probably torn apart.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.199
The only thing
i don't get is
why there's no blood.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.435
They're not dead.
If they were dead,
I'd sense it.

10:03.437 --> 10:04.736
If they were alive,
I'd smell it.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.304
Yeah, I'm not getting
anything either.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.639
Scott, what are you
talkin' about?

10:07.641 --> 10:09.474
You were in his head
for four minutes.
I timed it.

10:09.476 --> 10:11.176
Well, it's not
an exact science.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.612
And he's a kid. Maybe he's
too freaked out to remember.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.146
Why does it
matter if they're dead?

10:15.148 --> 10:15.146
Dead is dead.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.917
Okay, if it's just
a robbery,
we can't help them.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.753
And if it's something
supernatural, my dad
can't help them.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.756
It sounds like
you want it to
be supernatural.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.524
It's been, like,
three months since
anything's happened.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.259
Yeah, and once a week
you drag me out of bed

10:28.261 --> 10:30.428
like I'm some sort of
supernatural metal detector.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.364
Okay, it is way more
often than that.

10:32.366 --> 10:34.165
You can't tell me
that you think this is just

10:34.167 --> 10:36.935
some series of
impossible coincidences?

10:36.937 --> 10:40.205
What I'm saying is maybe
that wouldn't be so bad.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.595
You're starin' at
a broken windshield.

11:03.597 --> 11:06.331
There's something
wrong with it.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.366
It's broken.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.337
And it wasn't
a magic bullet.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.705
It was
a regular bullet.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.407
That blew out
a regular windshield.

11:18.044 --> 11:19.911
Just like that one,

11:21.180 --> 11:22.847
and that one,

11:27.687 --> 11:29.387
...and that one.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.900
Magic bullet.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.644
Lydia, so...

11:52.646 --> 11:55.413
My bad, sorry,
go ahead,
look pretty.

11:57.950 --> 11:59.484
Once... oh!

11:59.486 --> 12:00.785
That
was a good one.

12:07.526 --> 12:08.626
Stiles!

12:08.628 --> 12:10.361
You're still
in the photo.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.866
Sorry.
You ruined it.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.468
Why would I want to
ruin your yearbook photo?

12:16.470 --> 12:19.137
Maybe because
you haven't signed up
for your own photo yet?

12:19.139 --> 12:20.338
Yes, I did.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.008
It's blank.

12:24.977 --> 12:24.976
Uh...

12:24.978 --> 12:30.882
Or maybe you're sublimating
the stress of graduating by
avoiding key milestones.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.353
Psych paper.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.354
Oh.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.822
Hey, the deputy
searched the car.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.224
No slugs, no exit hole.

12:39.226 --> 12:42.127
And the address
Alex gave my dad,
it's an abandoned house.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.662
Come on! Missing parents,
suspicious guy on horseback,

12:44.664 --> 12:46.397
magic bullet.
Who's comin' with?

12:46.399 --> 12:47.932
I've got to retake
my photos.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.901
Yeah, not interested.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.703
I cannot miss
any more classes.

12:51.705 --> 12:54.139
Scott. Scott.
I missed 38 last semester.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.641
And Lydia's mom
is the only reason
I'm still in school.

12:56.643 --> 12:58.042
I can go
after school.

12:58.044 --> 13:01.946
You know what? Forget it.
I'll take Liam.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.488
- Yeah, I'm not taking Liam.
Mmm-mmm.

13:10.490 --> 13:11.823
Hey, can I get
a candid?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.958
Uh, no.
Yeah, sure.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.194
Okay, fine.
If you can explain to me

13:16.196 --> 13:18.830
why this is blue,
I'll let it go.

13:21.700 --> 13:23.034
Everyone smile.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.247
Schrodinger's cat.

13:44.023 --> 13:48.593
Ah, I can see
i impressed you all
with my artistic abilities.

13:53.466 --> 13:56.868
Schrodinger puts his cat in
a box with poisonous food.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.704
Now, until he opens
that box,

13:59.706 --> 14:03.274
the cat is, in theory,
both alive and dead.

14:03.276 --> 14:04.509
But when he opens it,

14:04.511 --> 14:10.114
it's either
"hello, mittens" or
"goodbye, socks."

14:12.018 --> 14:14.085
Putting aside
the potential animal
abuse here,

14:14.087 --> 14:16.421
what does it have
to do with physics?

14:17.790 --> 14:19.190
Yes, Hayden.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.160
It illustrates the concept
of quantum superposition.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.563
Light is both a particle and
wave until it's observed.

14:25.565 --> 14:29.300
Yes.
Excellent answer,
very impressive.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.804
Does observing something
change its behavior?

14:32.806 --> 14:35.240
Or alter its outcome?

14:35.242 --> 14:40.378
That's the question
of today's lab on
page 117.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.813
Break into groups of four.

14:46.785 --> 14:50.255
Have any of you guys
noticed that phones
can't geolocate today?

14:53.859 --> 14:55.159
Looks like it works.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.761
Yeah, but that's not north.

14:56.763 --> 14:58.997
Mmm.
That is.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.365
Mine is doing it too.

15:07.940 --> 15:11.142
Mr. Douglas
has a compass.

15:37.836 --> 15:39.237
What are you
gonna do with it?

15:39.239 --> 15:39.237
Follow it.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.240
Seriously?
Where do you
think it goes?

15:42.242 --> 15:46.177
I have no idea.
But we won't find out
till we open the box.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.082
Schrodinger's cat?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.054
I... I still don't get it.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.824
A chemical interaction
could cause a tint.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.993
What about
the muzzle flash of a gun?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.494
Could that be
blue or green?

16:03.496 --> 16:07.332
A muzzle flash is
created by superheated
gases leaving a gun.

16:07.334 --> 16:12.370
Um, it's possible that
the gas could include
copper, barium, cesium.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.672
Those can burn
blue and green.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.207
Can that tint
the glass?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.009
You think a gun did this?

16:18.344 --> 16:19.177
Maybe.

16:22.481 --> 16:23.681
Thirty-nine?

16:30.657 --> 16:33.958
Neither one of you
are going anywhere.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.393
Thirty-eight
classes, Scott.

16:35.395 --> 16:36.861
I had to beg
the superintendent.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.297
Mrs. Martin, Scott is
the sworn protector of
beacon hills.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.566
He can protect it
at 3:30.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.670
We're not waiting
till 3:30.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.721
<i> ...shattering the goal</i>
<i> 90 minutes before h-hour.</i>

17:03.723 --> 17:07.892
<i> Combat teams, each on a</i>
<i> schedule, continued their</i>
<i> unloading into assault boats.</i>

17:07.894 --> 17:11.796
<i> There would be little time</i>
<i> between the first assault</i>
<i> wave and the second.</i>

17:43.762 --> 17:46.230
Clark, where's the kid?

17:48.133 --> 17:49.700
He was in there
a second ago.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.670
This is
a sheriff's station.

17:52.672 --> 17:57.241
You, you don't lose a child
in the sheriff's station.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.210
Everybody stop
what you're doin',

17:59.212 --> 18:01.412
let's find the kid.

18:13.058 --> 18:14.859
Alex, what are you doin'?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.994
Can you lock me in?

18:16.996 --> 18:20.031
Well, you're not
under arrest
and you're a minor.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.867
Sir, we're required
to call child protective
services.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.602
Please don't.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.738
Please let me stay.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.107
Please.

18:32.277 --> 18:34.145
We're leavin' him here.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.152
Post a guard
outside the door.

18:42.821 --> 18:46.624
<i> ...smashed up the enemy's</i>
<i> gun batteries farther inland.</i>

18:46.626 --> 18:48.092
<i> Yet, so ingeniously...</i>

19:51.223 --> 19:54.192
That's
not creepy at all.

20:26.325 --> 20:27.625
You wanna split up?

20:27.627 --> 20:29.727
Uh, absolutely not.

21:09.668 --> 21:11.535
Maybe Alex got
the address wrong.

21:12.571 --> 21:13.771
Or he lied.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.375
Why would he lie?

22:01.620 --> 22:02.853
He didn't lie.

22:04.723 --> 22:07.358
Why didn't the cops say
anything about this?

22:09.294 --> 22:10.895
They don't know
it's here.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.631
They can't come here
without a warrant,

22:13.633 --> 22:15.700
and there's no owner
of record to serve
a warrant to.

22:15.702 --> 22:18.869
So unless there's some kind
of threat or imminent danger,

22:18.871 --> 22:20.071
they wouldn't come in.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.641
What?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.044
I think I heard something.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.387
What, what are you
doing here?

24:16.389 --> 24:18.222
This is Alex's house.
What are you doing here?

24:18.224 --> 24:19.323
This is where
the compass led us.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.624
What compass?

24:51.056 --> 24:52.122
Why is it doing that?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.224
I have no idea.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.659
They're all doing it.

25:03.068 --> 25:04.602
Wait!

25:29.461 --> 25:31.128
What?
What happened?

25:32.564 --> 25:34.231
He was here.
He shot at me.

25:36.969 --> 25:39.103
It was one of the guys
you saw in Alex's memory.

25:39.105 --> 25:39.970
The guy who took
his parents?

25:39.972 --> 25:41.639
No, no, no.
They weren't just taken.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.440
They were, they were
made to disappear.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.575
That's why
there's no furniture,

25:44.577 --> 25:46.076
that's why they weren't
in any of the photos.

25:47.779 --> 25:50.180
They were erased.

26:07.799 --> 26:09.433
I keep feeling like
it's familiar, you know?

26:09.435 --> 26:11.001
Like I've heard it before.

26:13.104 --> 26:14.738
That's French.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.373
A lingering thought
you can't reach.

26:16.375 --> 26:18.342
Okay, well, is there
a French word for,

26:18.344 --> 26:22.179
feeling an overwhelming sense
of urgency and impending doom?

26:26.351 --> 26:28.419
It's French
for banshee.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.988
Okay, what, what does
your banshee intuition
say this is?

26:30.990 --> 26:33.891
That you don't
have to figure it all out
right this second.

26:33.893 --> 26:36.093
But this kid.
This kid's got no one.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.628
You know, and...

26:38.563 --> 26:40.331
There's a reason why.
There's gotta be.

26:56.915 --> 27:00.684
"Give this man a ride,
sweet family will die."

27:00.686 --> 27:02.186
"Killer on the road."

27:03.054 --> 27:04.555
<i> Riders on the storm?</i>

27:04.557 --> 27:05.723
What?

27:05.725 --> 27:07.291
That's the song,
<i> riders on the storm?</i>

27:09.060 --> 27:10.494
That's it.

27:10.496 --> 27:11.895
What's it?

27:11.897 --> 27:14.365
The ghost riders.
The wild hunt.

27:14.367 --> 27:18.102
They come by storm,
riding horses.
And they take people.

27:19.204 --> 27:21.572
Lydia, you're so smart,
i could kiss you right now!

27:21.574 --> 27:22.673
Do not kiss me.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.642
Not gonna, no.
Mmm.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.343
Did it anyway!

27:34.819 --> 27:37.087
Hey, guys. Wait up.

27:37.722 --> 27:40.090
I fixed it.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.627
Uh, perfect!

27:43.629 --> 27:45.262
Looks brand new.

27:46.197 --> 27:47.398
He's going to notice.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.999
Nah, he'll never notice.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.001
We'll just put the compass
back and figure out
a way to help Scott.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.503
Or just put
the compass back.

27:52.505 --> 27:53.737
We can't leave it
all to Scott.

27:53.739 --> 27:55.572
Why not? He's the Alpha.

27:55.574 --> 27:56.774
Not for long.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.777
Who's gonna
take his place?

27:59.779 --> 28:00.978
You don't think
i could be the Alpha?

28:00.980 --> 28:03.447
No, no,
i wasn't saying that.

28:03.449 --> 28:08.018
It's just, magnetic anomalies
and guys on horseback
stealing people?

28:08.020 --> 28:09.453
We can't just
stay out of it.

28:10.755 --> 28:13.223
What's gonna
happen when Scott graduates?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.693
When there's no one here
to figure things out?

28:15.695 --> 28:17.294
I can be the... um...

28:18.930 --> 28:21.999
I can be the Alpha.
He can be the Alpha.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.133
Yeah.

28:30.675 --> 28:32.042
What is it?

28:34.212 --> 28:35.446
It's blood.

28:41.619 --> 28:44.121
Scott? Scott.
Hey.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.923
Hey. It's called
the wild hunt.

28:45.925 --> 28:48.759
It's a myth.
Only, apparently it's real.

28:48.761 --> 28:52.396
Like every other myth in
this town that should just
really remain a nightmare.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.565
The guy on the horse?
Yeah, they call
them ghost riders.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.634
Hang on one second.
Hey. That's my Jersey.
Where'd you get that?

28:57.636 --> 28:59.303
Coach gave it
to me at practice.

28:59.305 --> 29:02.272
We had practice?
Why doesn't anyone
tell me anything?

29:02.274 --> 29:04.775
Why would the ghost riders
want to take Alex's parents?

29:04.777 --> 29:06.777
Because that's what they do.
They take people, okay?

29:06.779 --> 29:08.912
They run around
collecting souls.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.714
And once they take you,
you're gone.

29:10.716 --> 29:13.484
But it's not just you,
it's everything about you.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.519
Yeah, like how
they took Alex's room.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.324
Does that mean Alex is next?

29:23.261 --> 29:25.062
Got your text.

29:25.064 --> 29:27.064
You said you needed
my help?

29:29.567 --> 29:32.503
Oh, god.
That kind of help.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.471
Something terrible
is going to happen.

29:35.607 --> 29:38.642
Okay, what is it?

29:38.644 --> 29:41.345
I don't know.
That's why I need
your help.

29:43.848 --> 29:46.150
I can't find the source.

29:46.152 --> 29:47.851
It's like it's coming
from everywhere.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.653
How is that possible?

29:49.655 --> 29:51.622
Maybe it's coming from
more than one place.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.323
In more than one piece.

29:53.325 --> 29:57.194
If it's in the air,
could it be coming
out of the vents?

30:19.884 --> 30:21.285
Stand back.

30:35.233 --> 30:36.433
It's open.

32:06.224 --> 32:07.891
Where's the kid?
What happened to him?

32:07.893 --> 32:09.092
What kid?

32:09.094 --> 32:10.460
Alex. The kid from
the car wreck?

32:10.462 --> 32:12.296
The kid whose parents
went missing last night?

32:12.664 --> 32:14.031
Who's Alex?

32:15.967 --> 32:19.503
Clark, listen to me.
He was here, okay?
You met him.

32:21.406 --> 32:21.405
Where's the sheriff?

32:21.407 --> 32:25.208
He got called out
to the high school.
They found a body.

32:25.210 --> 32:27.177
No one's been in
lock-up all day.

32:29.981 --> 32:31.381
Check for yourself.

32:41.826 --> 32:43.293
He's not on here.

32:45.496 --> 32:47.030
They took him.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.399
I shouldn't have
left him alone.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.768
He knew they were
coming for him.

32:51.770 --> 32:55.005
What if they're coming
back for everyone else
who was on that road?

32:57.008 --> 32:59.076
Then we already
know who's next.

32:59.911 --> 33:01.478
Liam and Hayden.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.420
I'll check the quad.
Let me know
if you find them.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.389
And see if your dad
knows anything?
Yeah, okay.

33:12.391 --> 33:14.524
Hey, Scott, wait.

33:14.526 --> 33:19.029
Um, I, I just, uh...

33:19.031 --> 33:24.434
I wanted
to say, um...

33:25.503 --> 33:26.803
Tell me later.

33:26.805 --> 33:28.171
Yeah, all right.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Sorry.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.444
Slow it down.
Sorry. Ms. Martin, sorry.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.046
Hey, have you seen,
uh, Liam and Hayden?

33:36.048 --> 33:37.814
Actually, forget that.
Have you seen my dad?

33:37.816 --> 33:38.982
Who?

33:38.984 --> 33:40.650
My dad. He's here
because of the body?

33:41.753 --> 33:43.520
How do you know
about the body?

33:43.522 --> 33:46.123
Because my dad's the sheriff.
Ms. Martin, are you okay?

33:47.825 --> 33:50.360
Uh, just wait here.

33:59.270 --> 34:01.171
When did you first
have the premonition?

34:02.673 --> 34:04.408
I was with stiles.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.710
We realized
it was the wild hunt.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.079
The riders, the horses.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.081
Souls
getting swept up.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.685
"Those who see
the wild hunt beware,

34:15.687 --> 34:18.188
"for you are already lost."

34:22.092 --> 34:24.460
Mason, Mason, hey,
where's Liam?

34:24.463 --> 34:26.630
Liam? Okay, there you go.
Liam, Hayden, perfect.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.864
You two, you two have to
listen to me right now.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.667
Alex is gone, just like
his parents, okay?

34:30.668 --> 34:33.503
The ghost riders took him,
so you guys,
you can't be alone.

34:33.505 --> 34:36.773
You got to stick
with Scott or with me
because I can see them.

34:39.277 --> 34:41.344
Why the hell are
you lookin' at me like that?

34:42.781 --> 34:44.447
Do we
even know him?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.585
I don't even
know if he goes here.

34:51.155 --> 34:53.356
Do you go to
this school?

34:54.759 --> 34:56.159
What's your name?

34:57.728 --> 34:59.796
<i> You haven't signed up</i>
<i> for your own photo yet?</i>

34:59.798 --> 35:00.864
<i> Yes, I did.</i>

35:00.866 --> 35:02.399
It's blank.

35:04.802 --> 35:07.404
<i> Excuse me, that's my Jersey,</i>
<i> where'd you get that?</i>

35:07.406 --> 35:09.739
Coach gave it to me
at practice.

35:29.695 --> 35:31.261
Son, you okay?

35:31.263 --> 35:33.497
Oh, thank god. Thank god.
Okay.

35:33.499 --> 35:36.266
Everyone's forgetting.

35:36.268 --> 35:38.568
Everyone is
forgetting everything...

35:38.570 --> 35:40.904
Okay, okay, slow down,
slow down.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.272
We'll figure
this out together.

35:42.274 --> 35:44.674
Okay.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.444
Now, why don't you tell me
your name?

36:12.703 --> 36:13.970
Scott?

36:13.972 --> 36:16.106
<i> Hey.</i>
Scott, where are you?

36:16.108 --> 36:18.141
Where are you right now?

36:18.143 --> 36:19.609
<i> Who's this?</i>

36:23.247 --> 36:24.848
<i> Alex.</i>
<i> The kid from the car wreck?</i>

36:24.850 --> 36:27.217
<i> The kid whose parents</i>
<i> went missing last night?</i>

36:27.219 --> 36:28.718
Who's Alex?

36:32.089 --> 36:34.724
Horses. He saw them.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.227
He saw the wild hunt.
Where's stiles?

36:37.229 --> 36:38.695
Who's stiles?

36:48.172 --> 36:49.639
It's me.

36:52.577 --> 36:53.777
I'm next.

37:17.001 --> 37:18.401
Stiles!

37:19.003 --> 37:20.303
Lydia?

37:20.305 --> 37:22.606
You know me. Oh, thank god.
You know me.
I know you.

37:22.608 --> 37:25.008
But I think everybody
else is forgetting.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.561
Hey, do you see him?

37:47.865 --> 37:49.299
See what?

37:49.301 --> 37:51.701
The guy on the horse.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.571
Stiles,
if you can see them,
they're gonna...

37:54.573 --> 37:56.706
No, I know, I know. Okay.
They're comin' for me.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.775
So you have to get away
from me right now, okay?

37:58.777 --> 37:59.909
I'm not leaving you!

38:03.047 --> 38:04.781
All right,
come on, come on!

38:07.518 --> 38:09.552
This way, this way,
come on.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.222
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Whoa! Whoa!

38:12.224 --> 38:13.823
Okay, this way.
Keep going.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.061
Where are they?

38:19.664 --> 38:22.732
They're everywhere.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.367
Come on,
come on, come on!

38:24.369 --> 38:26.703
Lydia,
don't look at them, okay?
Don't try to scream.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.139
They'll take you, too.
Just do not look at them.

38:29.141 --> 38:30.707
I won't. I won't.

38:48.559 --> 38:50.727
What are you doing?
We need to go!

38:56.233 --> 38:57.934
There's no time.

38:59.236 --> 39:01.971
Lydia, I'm going
to be erased, okay?

39:03.107 --> 39:05.575
Just like Alex.
You're gonna forget me.

39:05.577 --> 39:08.678
I won't. No,
i won't. I won't.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.981
Lydia, you will.

39:11.983 --> 39:17.220
Just try to find some way
to remember me, okay?

39:17.222 --> 39:20.090
Remember how you were
the first girl
i ever danced with?

39:21.258 --> 39:24.094
Or how I had a crush
on you freshman year.

39:24.096 --> 39:26.062
Sophomore year?
Junior year?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.534
Remember how
you saved my life?

39:32.136 --> 39:33.803
You saved my life too.

39:39.143 --> 39:40.610
Just remember...

39:42.480 --> 39:44.080
Remember I love you.

40:01.165 --> 40:03.133
Remember...

40:06.070 --> 40:09.005
Remember... remember...

40:53.951 --> 40:55.051
You okay?

40:58.689 --> 41:01.157
I have this feeling that I was
supposed to do something.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.127
Do what?

41:08.399 --> 41:09.866
I can't remember.
