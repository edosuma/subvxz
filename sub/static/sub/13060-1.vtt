01:25.720 --> 01:30.169
<i>My friends on the mainland think just because
I live in Hawaii, I live in paradise.</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:32.928
<i>Like a permanent vacation.</i>

01:32.920 --> 01:37.642
<i>We're all just out here sipping mai tais,
shaking our hips, and catching waves.</i>

01:38.360 --> 01:42.763
<i>Are they insane?
Do they think we 're immune to life?</i>

01:43.200 --> 01:46.679
<i>How can they possibly think our
families are less screwed up...</i>

01:46.680 --> 01:48.999
<i>...our cancers less fatal...</i>

01:49.000 --> 01:52.243
<i>...our heartaches less painful?</i>

01:52.240 --> 01:56.131
<i>Hell, I haven't been on</i> a
<i>surfboard in 15 years.</i>

01:59.040 --> 02:00.919
<i>For the last 23 days...</i>

02:00.920 --> 02:06.848
<i>...I've been living in a paradise of IVs
and urine bags and tracheal tubes.</i>

02:06.840 --> 02:08.568
<i>Paradise?</i>

02:09.320 --> 02:11.926
<i>Paradise can go fuck itself.</i>

02:19.560 --> 02:23.724
<i>This is Elizabeth
Thorson King, my wife.</i>

02:23.720 --> 02:25.006
<i>Twenty-three days ago...</i>

02:25.007 --> 02:28.639
<i>...she was launched from a powerboat
during a race and hit her head.</i>

02:28.640 --> 02:30.919
<i>Almost drowned.</i>

02:30.920 --> 02:36.609
<i>When I heard about the accident and
about the coma, I wasn't even in town.</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:41.925
<i>I was on Maui, on business, and
we hadn't spoken in three days.</i>

02:42.440 --> 02:45.603
<i>In a way, we hadn't
really spoken in months.</i>

02:49.400 --> 02:52.879
<i>If you're doing this to get my
attention, Liz, it's working.</i>

02:52.880 --> 02:54.839
<i>I'm ready now.</i>

02:54.840 --> 02:58.799
<i>I'm ready to talk.
I'm ready to change.</i>

02:58.800 --> 03:02.043
<i>I'm ready to be a real
husband and a real father.</i>

03:02.040 --> 03:04.202
<i>Just wake up.</i>

03:04.960 --> 03:07.281
<i>Please, Liz, just wake up.</i>

03:11.800 --> 03:13.131
Hey, Noe, what's up?

03:13.120 --> 03:15.485
<i>Matt, Scottie's teacher's
on the phone.</i>

03:15.486 --> 03:16.845
<i>She says it's urgent.</i>

03:16.846 --> 03:18.842
Okay, put her on.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.289
We don't think these
photographs...

03:23.290 --> 03:26.399
...are appropriate for Scottie to
be sharing with her classmates.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.279
Some of them went home quite disturbed,
and we got some angry calls from parents.

03:30.280 --> 03:33.919
Yeah, she's kind of been going to town
on this whole picture-taking thing.

03:33.920 --> 03:38.439
I had no idea.
Mr. King, we see this every day.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.399
Children acting out in school
when something is wrong at home.

03:42.400 --> 03:46.479
And your family is facing
a devastating crisis.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.166
Have you been engaging Scottie in talking
about everything that's going on?

03:50.160 --> 03:51.446
Yes, yes, absolutely.

03:51.447 --> 03:53.959
Encouraging her to
express her feelings?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.439
That's crucial. Mm-hm.
I understand.

03:56.440 --> 04:00.240
What's the matter with you, showing those
pictures of Mom for your art project?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.481
I'm a photographer, Dad,
a real photographer.

04:02.482 --> 04:04.801
No. You're overdoing it,
is what you're doing.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.006
I saw it in a book.

04:06.007 --> 04:10.159
Some famous photographer lady took
pictures of her mom in the hospital...

04:10.160 --> 04:12.845
...while she was dying, and
they're considered art.

04:12.840 --> 04:14.126
That's what I'm doing.

04:14.127 --> 04:17.119
First of all, your mother is
very sick, but she isn't dying.

04:17.120 --> 04:20.199
And second of all, we don't share
personal stuff with strangers.

04:20.200 --> 04:23.439
What's going on with
your mom is private.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.999
I'm hungry.
Can we get burgers? No.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.679
<i>The last time I took care of Scottie
by myself was when she was 3.</i>

04:29.680 --> 04:32.479
<i>Now she's 10, and I have no
idea what to do with her.</i>

04:32.480 --> 04:35.290
But I wanna eat now,
not in an hour.

04:35.280 --> 04:38.363
<i>And with Elizabeth in the
hospital, she's testing me.</i>

04:38.920 --> 04:42.519
<i>I'm the backup parent,
the understudy.</i>

04:42.520 --> 04:46.127
This is Matt King. I'm returning your call.
How can I help you?

04:46.120 --> 04:48.122
<i>It's your daughter Scottie.</i>

04:48.123 --> 04:52.079
<i>She's been texting some awful things to my
daughter, Lani, and I'd like her to stop.</i>

04:52.080 --> 04:54.719
<i>Huh.</i>

04:54.720 --> 04:57.479
<i>"We all know you grew
pubes over the summer."</i>

04:57.480 --> 05:01.405
<i>I mean, my daughter can't help it if she's
developing a little early for her age.</i>

05:01.400 --> 05:04.404
<i>You think that's nice?
Well, that's not like her at all.</i>

05:04.760 --> 05:06.999
She's usually very sweet.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.879
As you may know, her mother isn't well.
Maybe this is how she's dealing with it.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.879
<i>I'm very sorry about your
family situation, Mr. King...</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:16.719
<i>...but my daughter comes
home from school in tears.</i>

05:16.720 --> 05:19.007
Yeah, no, I get it I'm sorry.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.048
<i>Scottie's the one who
should be sorry.</i>

05:21.049 --> 05:23.079
<i>I want her to come
over and apologize...</i>

05:23.080 --> 05:26.119
<i>...and I don't ever want her
to text my daughter again.</i>

05:26.120 --> 05:29.567
<i>If she doesn't apologize, I'll
take it up with the dean.</i>

05:29.560 --> 05:32.245
<i>You can't buy your
way out of this.</i>

05:35.000 --> 05:36.889
Can you give me an address?

05:50.600 --> 05:52.364
Thank you for coming by.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.085
Hi.

05:56.840 --> 06:01.079
I forgot to mention Scottie said she didn't
wanna be Lani's partner at the rock wall...

06:01.080 --> 06:04.129
...because she didn't wanna fall
into my daughter's butt crack.

06:04.120 --> 06:07.169
That doesn't even make sense.
Ah.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.239
<i>Shirts off. Shirts off.</i>

06:11.240 --> 06:13.639
<i>Good, good, good, good job.</i>

06:13.640 --> 06:15.961
<i>I don't think she has any idea.</i>

06:15.960 --> 06:18.725
<i>That was very good, Bobby Brown.
Yeah. Here.</i>

06:19.120 --> 06:23.239
<i>Because she goes, "I'm living at this.
I'll meet you out in front." So...</i>

06:23.240 --> 06:26.961
Scottie, you have something
you wanna say to Lani?

06:26.960 --> 06:28.724
Sorry.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.607
<i>He knows he's going
away for a while.</i>

06:32.320 --> 06:36.159
<i>If he's got a chance, he's bolting. Great.
Well, it was nice meeting you both.</i>

06:36.160 --> 06:39.159
You should come over for a swim
or a hike or something, okay?

06:39.160 --> 06:41.162
I don't think she's
sorry at all.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.164
- She's gonna keep on doing it, I can tell.
- No, she won't.

06:44.560 --> 06:48.849
Look. Scottie, you're
gonna stop, right?

06:49.520 --> 06:52.126
And you're really,
really sorry, right?

06:53.280 --> 06:56.966
<i>Seems like every time I forget to pray,
we don't catch a guy for three days.</i>

06:56.960 --> 06:58.530
<i>I know, I'm telling you, man.</i>

07:02.000 --> 07:03.843
Oh, and, Mr. King? Yeah?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.080
Good luck with the sale.

07:06.240 --> 07:10.439
They say your decision will have a major
impact on Hawaii's real-estate world.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.761
Not to mention the whole
landscape of Kauai.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.001
Hundreds of millions
of dollars, yeah?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.239
Yeah. It's a big decision.

07:18.240 --> 07:22.519
My husband's family's from Kauai.
Hanapepe, born and bred.

07:22.520 --> 07:26.047
They hope you don't sell.
You don't say.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.646
All that traffic
it's gonna make.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.441
<i>As if Liz's coma weren't
enough already...</i>

07:35.442 --> 07:38.079
<i>...the whole goddamn state
is following my decision...</i>

07:38.080 --> 07:41.607
<i>...on who's gonna buy 25,000
pristine acres on Kauai...</i>

07:41.600 --> 07:44.490
<i>...that my family has
owned since the 1860s.</i>

07:45.040 --> 07:49.443
<i>A lot of my cousins are broke, and the
sale will make us all very, very rich.</i>

07:51.480 --> 07:54.479
<i>My family meets in six
days to approve a buyer.</i>

07:54.480 --> 07:57.723
<i>But ever since my father died,
I'm the sole trustee...</i>

07:57.720 --> 08:01.088
<i>...which means I alone
hold all the cards.</i>

08:05.800 --> 08:09.359
<i>My great-great-grandmother was
Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani...</i>

08:09.360 --> 08:12.364
<i>...one of the last direct
descendants of King Kamehameha.</i>

08:12.360 --> 08:14.806
<i>She was originally supposed
to marry her cousin...</i>

08:14.807 --> 08:17.759
<i>...but she fell in love with
Edward King, her haole banker...</i>

08:17.760 --> 08:20.039
<i>...whose parents had
been missionaries.</i>

08:20.040 --> 08:23.079
<i>Between his land deals and
her huge inheritance...</i>

08:23.080 --> 08:26.402
<i>...generations of their
descendants, all of us...</i>

08:26.400 --> 08:31.691
<i>...have watched the past unfurl millions
into our laps through leases and sales.</i>

08:33.320 --> 08:36.438
<i>Now something called the rule
against perpetuities...</i>

08:36.440 --> 08:38.760
<i>...is forcing us to
dissolve the trust...</i>

08:38.760 --> 08:43.368
<i>...and we're selling our last huge
parcel of virgin Hawaiian land.</i>

08:46.280 --> 08:49.727
<i>Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't
blown my share of the trust money.</i>

08:49.720 --> 08:51.449
<i>Just like my father before me...</i>

08:51.450 --> 08:54.359
<i>...I live only on the income
from my law practice.</i>

08:54.360 --> 08:57.839
<i>I don't want my daughters growing
up spoiled and entitled.</i>

08:57.840 --> 09:01.439
<i>Liz always accuses me of stinginess,
but I agree with my father.</i>

09:01.440 --> 09:05.479
<i>You give your children enough money to do
something, but not enough to do nothing.</i>

09:05.480 --> 09:07.209
Matt.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.009
Your cousins are here.

09:14.400 --> 09:18.359
<i>Not only am I the sole trustee, but I
specialize in real-estate transaction law...</i>

09:18.360 --> 09:22.410
<i>...so a few of the more involved cousins
have been meeting with me to analyze bids.</i>

09:22.400 --> 09:23.606
Hey. How's it, Matt?

09:23.607 --> 09:27.399
<i>Cousin Hal, Cousin
Milo, Cousin Stan...</i>

09:27.400 --> 09:30.559
<i>...Cousin Six, Cousin
Wink, Cousin Connie...</i>

09:30.560 --> 09:32.279
How you doing? Okay?

09:32.280 --> 09:35.119
<i>...and Cousin Dave, both of
whom oppose the sale entirely.</i>

09:35.120 --> 09:37.999
<i>- Good to see you.
- Don't be fooled by appearances.</i>

09:38.000 --> 09:41.719
<i>In Hawaii, some of the most powerful
people look like bums and stuntmen.</i>

09:41.720 --> 09:43.484
All right, so where are we?

09:43.480 --> 09:45.289
<i>Proposals are
virtually the same.</i>

09:45.290 --> 09:48.279
<i>Hotels, shopping centers,
condos and golf courses.</i>

09:48.280 --> 09:49.839
I have some major concerns...

09:49.840 --> 09:52.679
<i>A Chicago group is offering
half a billion dollars.</i>

09:52.680 --> 09:56.319
<i>But we're leaning towards a lower
bid from a guy named Don Holitzer.</i>

09:56.320 --> 10:00.039
<i>He's actually from Kauai.
Made a fortune in Silicon Valley.</i>

10:00.040 --> 10:03.679
<i>Old Cousin Hugh is pushing us in
that direction, and I say, why not?</i>

10:03.680 --> 10:06.519
<i>The money would come from
Hawaii and stay in Hawaii.</i>

10:06.520 --> 10:10.286
There's nothing about saving the heiau.
You know, it's ridiculous.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.285
And there's no beach access like they
say, and that's really, really...

10:20.480 --> 10:23.768
<i>Elizabeth's gonna make it out okay.
I know it.</i>

10:23.760 --> 10:25.808
<i>It's not her time yet.</i>

10:29.280 --> 10:30.679
<i>She'll wake up.</i>

10:30.680 --> 10:33.519
<i>Scottie and Alexandra will
have their mother back.</i>

10:33.520 --> 10:35.648
<i>And we'll talk about
our marriage.</i>

10:35.640 --> 10:38.246
<i>I know I can make things right.</i>

10:38.880 --> 10:43.319
<i>I'll sell the land, quit my practice,
and buy her whatever she wants.</i>

10:43.320 --> 10:46.479
<i>A big boat. A house in France.</i>

10:46.480 --> 10:49.563
<i>We'll take a trip around the
world, just the two of us.</i>

10:49.560 --> 10:53.167
<i>We'll get close again,
like the early days.</i>

10:54.200 --> 10:57.249
<i>I wish I had better
news, Matthew.</i>

10:57.240 --> 11:01.768
<i>But Dr. Chun and Dr. Mueller and
I agree that her condition...</i>

11:02.240 --> 11:04.599
...it's deteriorating.

11:04.600 --> 11:07.759
She has no eye movement, she
has no pupillary responses...

11:07.760 --> 11:13.519
...she has no brain-stem
reflexes whatsoever.

11:13.520 --> 11:19.926
I mean, the machines can keep her alive, but
the quality of her life would be so poor.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.844
Basically the way it is now.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.082
She'll never be the
way she was, Matt.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.605
Never.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.968
We know that now.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.850
Look, uh ""

11:39.000 --> 11:42.959
I can't tell you how sorry
I am to tell you this.

11:42.960 --> 11:45.964
And you do have your daughters.

11:45.960 --> 11:49.123
There's just nothing
more that we can do.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.879
So if we do go ahead and
take her off the machines...

11:57.880 --> 11:59.644
There's no "if."

11:59.640 --> 12:03.964
It's "when." I have a legal obligation.
You know that.

12:08.760 --> 12:10.919
How long will she last?

12:10.920 --> 12:12.479
Well, it's hard to say.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.639
It could be a few days, it
could be a couple of weeks.

12:15.640 --> 12:20.931
For planning purposes, I think you should
work off the shortest possible scenario.

12:20.920 --> 12:25.289
I know I've gotta get the ball rolling
on the organ donations right away.

12:27.360 --> 12:28.885
Matt.

12:30.200 --> 12:33.170
Elizabeth has many friends.

12:33.160 --> 12:35.288
She has a big life.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.851
If you're gonna let everybody
know to say goodbye...

12:39.840 --> 12:44.528
...which is the typical protocol for
these situations, you start now.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.406
Then when the last day comes...

12:49.120 --> 12:51.600
...they'll feel more ready.

12:52.680 --> 12:56.287
Or as ready as they can feel
for something like this.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.680
I'm so sorry, Matt.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.008
Hey. Hey. There he is.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.764
How's it going? What's going on?

13:48.765 --> 13:51.519
She was looking a little pale
lately, all cooped up here.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.411
I know she'd be mortified if nobody helped
her out with some lipstick and blush.

13:55.400 --> 13:56.686
I know she'll grill me.

13:56.687 --> 13:59.604
Of course, Kai's getting her
caught up on the latest gossip.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.604
Well, I don't wanna start
from scratch later.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.769
Oh, and, Matt, uh,
on the way here...

14:04.770 --> 14:08.128
...we stopped by and put some meals
in your fridge, all ready to nuke.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.360
Mm-hm.

14:10.520 --> 14:12.761
So, what's the latest, anyway, Matt?
Any updates?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.160
Just more of the same.

14:15.161 --> 14:18.004
Just keeping the kidneys and
other vital organs working...

14:18.000 --> 14:20.606
...and hoping for the best.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.765
The food at the club is so good.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.524
Yeah, they do a good job here.
Come here.

15:14.525 --> 15:15.806
Mm.

15:17.320 --> 15:21.325
Why is it called a jellyfish?
It's not a fish, it's not jelly.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.651
I have no idea.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.448
You ask good questions, Scottie.
You're getting too smart for me.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.491
I'm gonna ask Mom
when she wakes up.

15:29.920 --> 15:33.083
Do you think she's gonna
know everything she used to?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.730
I don't know.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.889
I'll be right back.

15:51.240 --> 15:54.801
- Hi, Matt. Hi, Scottie.
- Troy.

15:54.800 --> 15:58.327
So, what's going on?
I mean, how's Elizabeth doing?

15:58.840 --> 16:00.205
The same.

16:00.200 --> 16:03.090
Well, you know, I went and
visited her last week...

16:03.880 --> 16:05.564
...and, uh, she
looked pretty good.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.559
Then why'd you ask?
I don't know.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.399
I guess I just wanted to
know what the latest is.

16:10.400 --> 16:15.359
You know, I've been praying for her every
day, you guys, really hard, seriously.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.759
And, well, what I meant to say was
when I was there, I talked to her...

16:18.760 --> 16:21.359
...and she moved her hand.

16:21.360 --> 16:23.399
And then I was, like...
I was encouraged.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.562
I thought that that was
an encouraging sign.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.085
That's enough.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.768
I really think she heard me.
Look, Troy, go to your friends.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.843
There's no hard feelings.
Let's just leave it alone.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.719
I told you, Matt.

16:42.720 --> 16:46.039
The water that day was so choppy.
I've told you a hundred times.

16:46.040 --> 16:48.239
What happened to her
could've happened to me.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.679
The ocean was brutal that day.
Ask anybody.

16:50.680 --> 16:53.919
You weren't supposed to be driving.
She was supposed to be driving.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.479
She wanted me to drive.

16:55.480 --> 16:58.759
She's the one that told me to pass
the other boat before the turn.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.279
You know, it's just your
whole attitude towards me.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.807
I didn't...
You know, I feel terrible about it.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.929
Plus, I almost drowned
myself when the boat caps...

17:10.280 --> 17:11.964
Hey.

17:13.319 --> 17:16.959
Scottie! Hey, Scottie! Scottie!

17:16.960 --> 17:19.849
Hey. Listen.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.683
Don't pay any attention
to that guy.

17:21.684 --> 17:23.762
That guy's a dope. I hate him.

17:23.760 --> 17:25.922
Yeah, I know.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.039
Hey, let's do something crazy.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.119
Let's drive to the airport, we'll
hop over to the Big Island...

17:32.120 --> 17:34.639
...and we'll surprise your sister.
What do you say?

17:34.640 --> 17:37.799
Right now? Yeah, it'll be fun.
She's not expecting us.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.959
And we can bring her home.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.931
I think she should be with us, don't you?
Don't you miss her? I miss her.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.890
Yeah. I mean, I'm out of school.
She should be too.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.205
There you go. Okay.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.123
Let's go. Come on.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.842
Hey, Troy.

18:08.920 --> 18:13.079
<i>Somehow it feels natural to find a
daughter of mine on a different island.</i>

18:13.080 --> 18:15.919
<i>- A family seems exactly</i>-

18:15.920 --> 18:19.561
<i>All part of the same whole but
still separate and alone...</i>

18:19.560 --> 18:22.530
<i>...and always drifting
slowly apart.</i>

18:59.560 --> 19:01.608
That's the wrong door.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.364
Go back to sleep, Braelynn.
It's okay.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.559
Wake up your roommate, please.

19:20.560 --> 19:25.248
Um, Alex isn't here.
Where is she?

19:25.240 --> 19:29.723
I think she's somewhere outside.
Where outside?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.206
Hit it that way.

19:32.207 --> 19:35.727
No, between there. Fuckhead.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.447
Why are you hitting it that way?

19:37.448 --> 19:39.681
You're supposed to be
going through... Dude.

19:39.682 --> 19:42.331
Hey, girls!
What do you think you're doing?

19:42.320 --> 19:44.209
- Oh, shit, here.
- Run.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.279
Fuck. Hi, Alex.
It's me, Scottie.

19:48.280 --> 19:51.409
I pay $35,000 a year for this
kind of crap not to happen.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.449
Dad?

19:55.480 --> 19:57.279
My fucking dad is here.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.959
You need to watch your language.
This is unacceptable behavior.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.128
What's up, Dad?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.770
What's happening?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.127
You need to come home
and see your mom.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.128
Fuck Mom.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.640
Really? What did I just
say about the language?

20:18.640 --> 20:21.120
You could get expelled
for all of this.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.291
<i>What is it that makes the women in
my life wanna destroy themselves?</i>

20:27.280 --> 20:31.763
<i>Elizabeth with her motorcycles
and speedboats and drinking.</i>

20:32.320 --> 20:35.799
<i>Alexandra with her
drugs and older guys.</i>

20:35.800 --> 20:37.399
<i>And Scottie.</i>

20:37.400 --> 20:39.159
<i>With Elizabeth gone...</i>

20:39.160 --> 20:42.004
<i>...what kind of a chance
will she have with just me?</i>

20:42.000 --> 20:43.490
Go to bed.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.849
All right.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.001
There we go.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.964
I don't like eggs.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.647
Why didn't you tell me before I made them?
I thought they were for you.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.564
Good morning.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.250
How you feeling? Hung over?

21:49.400 --> 21:50.959
Why am I not surprised?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.879
I thought you were supposed to
be getting your act together.

21:53.880 --> 21:57.559
I have gotten my act together.
I was just drinking.

21:57.560 --> 22:02.088
I've been doing really well, actually.
Nobody ever seems to notice that.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.286
Grades are better.

22:03.287 --> 22:06.045
I was in that stupid play you
guys didn't bother to see.

22:06.040 --> 22:08.168
Do you even remember
the name of it?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.571
That's what I thought.

22:11.440 --> 22:15.359
So what? What if I got drunk on the
one night you happened to stop by?

22:15.360 --> 22:16.919
So fucking what?

22:16.920 --> 22:19.207
Hey, hey, watch your
language around Scottie.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.440
I don't care.

22:21.920 --> 22:23.759
anyway...

22:23.760 --> 22:27.359
Listen, it's nice to see you.

22:27.360 --> 22:30.045
Welcome home. Here.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.929
You want some eggs?

22:45.640 --> 22:48.119
I can't believe that.

22:48.120 --> 22:49.959
What?

22:49.960 --> 22:53.965
Heh. Oh, my God. Uh-huh.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.440
Hey, Alex? Well, what'd she say?

22:58.720 --> 23:00.688
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh...

23:01.440 --> 23:03.044
The pool's really dirty.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.126
Uh-huh.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.159
Wait, what?

23:07.160 --> 23:09.811
Hey, I really need to talk to you.
She didn't say...

23:09.800 --> 23:11.802
She didn't say anything to me.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.803
Uh-huh. Ha, ha.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.129
Oh, my God, I can't
believe she...

23:19.120 --> 23:23.569
Hey, uh... Yeah, yeah, I gotta go.
Okay, I'll see you later.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.206
Um...

23:28.160 --> 23:31.846
What day does the pool guy come?
He comes...

23:32.920 --> 23:35.999
You know, I don't know when he comes.
Awesome.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.999
Sid's coming over. Who's Sid?

23:39.000 --> 23:42.279
A really good friend from Punahou.
We were in school together for years.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.408
Oh. Okay.

23:44.400 --> 23:47.563
He wants to be here for me
with all this shit happening.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.330
Do I know his parents? Nope.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.839
He might stay over too. Is that cool?
Hey, Alex, over here.

23:55.840 --> 23:58.359
What the fuck?
Get out of my underwear, you freak.

23:58.360 --> 24:00.199
No. Okay, no, no, no.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.851
Don't I look divine? Back inside.
Put on a swimsuit.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.207
Why? Now.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.124
Real good job you're doing.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.919
That's part of why I
brought you here.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.519
You have to help me.
I don't know what to do with her.

24:15.520 --> 24:20.559
Maybe if you spent more time with her, she
wouldn't act like such a complete spaz.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.479
Get her out of town.
Go camp on Kauai.

24:23.480 --> 24:27.039
That's what Mom used to do with
me whenever I was losing it.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.919
Hey, listen. No, listen.
Listen to me.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.969
Your mother's not well.
Yeah, obviously.

24:34.960 --> 24:36.564
No.

24:39.120 --> 24:43.842
They just told me she's not gonna wake up.
We know for sure now.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.884
The doctors are gonna
stop caring for her.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.207
Your mother wanted it this way.
She has this...

24:53.040 --> 24:58.444
She has this will, see, that says
that we have to do it this way.

24:58.440 --> 25:00.363
We both do.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.648
You understand what I'm saying?

25:07.560 --> 25:09.767
That's why I got you.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.566
Honey, we're letting her go.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.399
Why did you have to tell
me in the goddamn pool?

25:46.400 --> 25:48.959
Alex. Alex.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.610
What?

25:50.600 --> 25:52.329
What do you want?

25:53.320 --> 25:54.651
Uh...

26:08.480 --> 26:10.767
I just found out yesterday.

26:17.320 --> 26:23.089
We have to go through this thing
together, you and Scottie and me.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.930
And I have to go around and
tell people what's happening.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.446
Family and a few close friends.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.241
Sometimes I'm gonna need
you to come with me.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.846
Sometimes I need you
to watch Scottie.

26:38.920 --> 26:43.369
You want me to go around with you and
tell people that Mom's gonna die?

26:43.840 --> 26:45.679
What's the point of that?

26:45.680 --> 26:50.119
Breaking the news, watching them
cry, dealing with their emotions?

26:50.120 --> 26:52.679
How depressing is that gonna be?
Just call them.

26:52.680 --> 26:55.039
Alex, nobody wants
to do any of this.

26:55.040 --> 26:59.204
But we have to tell your grandpa
and Tutu and a few friends.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.329
They have the right to know, and
they have the right to say goodbye.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.359
I don't wanna talk
about Mom with anyone.

27:05.360 --> 27:09.559
Look, whatever you two fought about
over Christmas, you have to drop it.

27:09.560 --> 27:10.719
Grow up.

27:10.720 --> 27:12.927
You love your mother,
your mother loves you.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.890
I can't drop it. You have to.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.523
You really don't
have a clue, do you?

27:23.880 --> 27:25.291
Dad...

27:26.080 --> 27:29.243
Dad, Mom was cheating on you.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.281
That is what we fought about.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.561
When I was home at Christmas,
I caught her with a guy.

27:38.520 --> 27:41.763
It made me sick to
see her near you.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.925
I went back to school thinking that that
was it, that I was just done with her.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.890
I was gonna call and tell
you everything and...

27:50.760 --> 27:53.730
And then the accident
happened and...

27:55.440 --> 27:58.649
I was waiting until
she woke up, I guess.

28:00.920 --> 28:03.287
You didn't even suspect, right?

28:05.600 --> 28:07.011
Right?

28:07.760 --> 28:11.287
It disgusted me too.
You're always so busy.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.003
"Caught her with a guy
," what does that mean?

28:18.440 --> 28:21.728
I was on my way to swim in the
Black Point pool with Brandy...

28:21.720 --> 28:26.044
...and suddenly I see Mom and some
douche bag walking into a house.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.442
His house, I guess.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.969
Just some guy, it
could be anybody.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.645
No, he had his hand on her ass.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.244
It was gross.

28:44.440 --> 28:45.965
Then what? Then nothing.

28:45.960 --> 28:48.486
Then they went into the house.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.728
A few days later, I told her
I knew what she was doing.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.324
And?

28:55.000 --> 28:59.244
And first, she acted like she had
no idea what I was talking about.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.447
Like I'm fucking blind.

29:02.240 --> 29:06.484
And then she got, like, super
mad and yelled and denied it.

29:07.480 --> 29:11.166
That was when I decided that I didn't
want anything more to do with her.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.849
Who is he?

29:16.840 --> 29:19.411
I don't know, some guy.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.166
What's he look like?

29:22.120 --> 29:23.849
Dark hair.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.131
Oh.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.204
Watch your sister.

30:26.160 --> 30:27.879
Hello?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.564
Kai?

30:29.560 --> 30:31.164
Mark?

30:32.440 --> 30:34.199
It's me, Matt.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.599
No, it's not.

30:35.600 --> 30:38.719
- I'm just saying you always wanna have...
- I'm not a mind reader.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.121
Wait. Hello?

30:41.120 --> 30:43.202
It's me, it's Matt.

30:44.600 --> 30:46.762
- Oh, hey, Matt.
- Is this a bad time?

30:46.760 --> 30:48.250
Uh, no, no, we're just fighting.

30:48.251 --> 30:50.999
Uh, come on in. You want coffee?
You want something to drink?

30:51.000 --> 30:52.599
No, thanks.

30:52.600 --> 30:55.171
- Fighting about something stupid.
- It's not stupid.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.364
It is stupid.

30:56.365 --> 30:58.010
He wants us to throw parties...

30:58.011 --> 31:01.399
...and have people over, which we do,
but who winds up doing the work?

31:01.400 --> 31:03.721
You don't have to do anything.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.290
- That's the whole point.
- I do.

31:05.291 --> 31:08.759
It doesn't have to be work.
You don't have to clean and buy an outfit.

31:08.760 --> 31:12.159
I'm supposed to be disgusting? Ugh.
And think up a goddamn theme cocktail.

31:12.160 --> 31:15.839
We could just invite people over to
hang out and drink whatever we have.

31:15.840 --> 31:20.119
Let's talk about it later.
Oh, shit, Matt, is everything okay?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.565
Is there any news?

31:21.560 --> 31:25.246
In fact, there is. I'll tell you
about it in a minute. Who is he?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.923
Does she love him?

31:32.720 --> 31:34.359
Who is he?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.799
Matt...

31:35.800 --> 31:40.169
I'm sorry to put you in that position, but I'm
not really the one who put you there, am I?

31:40.160 --> 31:43.642
I'd like to know who the guy
is that my wife was seeing.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.439
You're angry. You have very
keen powers of observation.

31:47.440 --> 31:50.159
You know what?
I think we should talk about this later.

31:50.160 --> 31:52.242
You need to cool it.

31:52.240 --> 31:55.528
Is it Troy?
That fucking Neanderthal.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.246
You don't know him.

31:59.247 --> 32:02.879
Mark, don't you even. Shame on you.
You're supposed to be her friend.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.959
Well, guess what.
I'm Matt's friend too, okay?

32:05.960 --> 32:09.760
And this is a unique and dramatic
situation, and I would wanna know.

32:09.760 --> 32:13.685
Yeah, well, don't betray her when she's
not even here to defend herself.

32:16.240 --> 32:20.768
Matt, look, you might not be
able to hear this right now...

32:20.760 --> 32:22.762
...but it's not her fault.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.959
Your marriage was not...

32:25.960 --> 32:27.759
Just... She was lonely.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.679
So you're gonna talk to me
in clichés about women?

32:30.680 --> 32:32.887
Nothing is ever a woman's fault.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.724
Was it still going on when
she had the accident?

32:37.720 --> 32:38.926
But I stayed out of it.

32:38.927 --> 32:41.685
Any time Kai would bring
it up, I would walk away.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.566
You what?

32:46.120 --> 32:47.360
Probably egged her on.

32:47.361 --> 32:50.359
Add a little drama in your
life without any actual risk.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.921
Who do you think you're protecting, Kai?
She doesn't need your protection.

32:53.920 --> 32:56.048
It's over. She's gonna die.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.926
Don't say that.

32:57.927 --> 32:59.968
It's true.
I was gonna tell you yesterday.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.325
She's never gonna wake up.

33:01.326 --> 33:03.599
You hear me?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

33:03.600 --> 33:04.886
She's gone.

33:04.880 --> 33:09.090
We're pulling the plug.
You were putting lipstick on a corpse.

33:13.960 --> 33:16.088
Come on, Matt.

33:16.080 --> 33:18.242
That's a little intense.

33:40.920 --> 33:42.809
Does she love him?

33:43.800 --> 33:46.399
How can you ask about him
when she's gonna die?

33:46.400 --> 33:50.644
Who cares? Yes, she loves him.
Loved him, whatever.

33:50.640 --> 33:53.325
She was crazy about him.
She was gonna...

33:54.160 --> 33:56.561
She was gonna ask
you for a divorce.

34:09.800 --> 34:12.201
You still haven't
told me who he is.

34:13.960 --> 34:15.803
I guess it doesn't matter.

34:26.080 --> 34:28.811
Matt. Matt.

34:30.679 --> 34:32.842
Brian Speer.

34:32.840 --> 34:36.639
His name's Brian
Speer, with two E's.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.199
They're just, like, cheap.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.886
They're just like, "Get it
over with, cut corners."

35:24.880 --> 35:26.370
Hi, Daddy.

35:27.240 --> 35:31.006
Dad, this is, uh, Sid.
Hello, Sid.

35:33.200 --> 35:35.202
What's up, bro?

35:37.640 --> 35:40.119
Don't ever do that to me again.

35:40.120 --> 35:41.919
We're gonna see
your grandparents.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.519
And, Scottie, Auntie Esther's
gonna come watch you.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.799
Dad, Sid's coming with us, okay?

35:46.800 --> 35:48.679
Yeah, listen, Sid, uh...

35:48.680 --> 35:51.359
...what's going on this week is a
family matter, you understand?

35:51.360 --> 35:54.170
Sid's not gonna be interested
in meeting your grandparents.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.525
He's gonna be bored stiff.

35:55.526 --> 35:58.251
Dad, I told you that he
was gonna be with me.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.641
I'll be a lot more
civil with him around.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.608
What can I say?

36:14.040 --> 36:16.520
It's like reading Korean.

36:16.520 --> 36:19.285
Scott, if you want to, I
can walk you through it.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.682
Jibber-jabber.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.645
It's an advance directive.

36:25.646 --> 36:29.239
It's basically her instructions
on what procedures she wants.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.639
In this case...
I know goddamn well what it says.

36:31.640 --> 36:35.770
Says she doesn't want us sitting
around watching her spoil like milk.

36:35.760 --> 36:40.971
Says if there's nothing the doctors can
do, she'd rather just get on with it.

36:41.680 --> 36:45.159
Elizabeth had the good sense
to write this thing here.

36:45.160 --> 36:49.839
She was always a thoughtful
girl, a strong girl.

36:49.840 --> 36:54.279
Hell of a lot stronger than her brother.
Barry whines his way through life.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.601
Might even be a homosexual,
for all I know.

36:56.600 --> 36:59.968
Yeah, Scott, I don't think so.
And she's stronger than you, Matt.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.119
She lived more in a year than
you lived in a decade...

37:03.120 --> 37:05.799
...sitting in that office,
hoarding all your cash.

37:05.800 --> 37:10.119
All that money you refuse to use.
What the hell good is it?

37:10.120 --> 37:14.639
Now you and your family are getting ready
to cash in your chips. What the hell for?

37:14.640 --> 37:17.679
Maybe if you let my baby
have her own boat...

37:17.680 --> 37:19.319
...bought her safe equipment...

37:19.320 --> 37:22.839
...maybe let her go on those
shopping sprees women like...

37:22.840 --> 37:26.401
...maybe she wouldn't have gone
in for those thrill sports.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.609
Maybe if you'd provided
more thrills at home.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.284
And you, Alexandra.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.009
Putting your mother
through hell...

37:35.010 --> 37:38.319
...when all she was trying to do was
instill sense and drive in you.

37:38.320 --> 37:41.767
Shame on you. Shame on you.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.001
You should try to
be more like her.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.767
She was a good girl.

37:50.360 --> 37:52.488
She was a good girl.

38:38.400 --> 38:43.959
Hi, Alice. It's me, it's Matt.
It's good to see you.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.639
Good to see you too. Hey, Tutu.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.559
That's Alexandra.
That's your granddaughter.

38:50.560 --> 38:54.999
That's your son-in-law, Matt.
This is your family.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.999
Well, except for
that kid over there.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.359
I don't know who the hell he is.
Who are you?

38:59.360 --> 39:02.091
What are you doing here?
He's my friend.

39:02.080 --> 39:03.889
Good afternoon.

39:08.360 --> 39:14.759
Alice, we're going to Queen's Hospital
this afternoon and see Elizabeth.

39:14.760 --> 39:16.759
We are? Yes.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.759
She needs us, just like
when she was a little girl.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.119
We need to see her
in the hospital.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.879
So think about what she might
wanna have in her room...

39:24.880 --> 39:29.283
...and we'll take it to her
and put it next to her bed.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.806
Queen Elizabeth?

39:32.440 --> 39:35.119
That's wonderful.

39:35.120 --> 39:37.521
I have to put on a nice dress.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.729
Ha, ha. Is she serious?

39:41.640 --> 39:43.039
Shut up, kid.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.169
Ha, ha.
I've never met a queen before.

39:50.440 --> 39:53.728
I'm sorry, man.
I was just laughing. It's funny.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.326
I mean, I think she knows
she's being funny.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.043
I'm gonna hit you.

40:02.640 --> 40:04.479
That was unreal.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.802
I mean, how often do old
people just haul off...

40:07.800 --> 40:10.167
...and fucking coldcock
you like that?

40:11.000 --> 40:13.321
He's hit me a couple of
times over the years.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.845
And watch your language.

40:15.320 --> 40:17.209
Can I see it?

40:17.200 --> 40:19.521
Holy shit.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.959
Hey, could you two just cool
it when you're around me?

40:23.960 --> 40:27.479
Just stop touching each other?

40:27.480 --> 40:28.766
Whoa, man.

40:28.760 --> 40:32.162
Maybe that's why your wife cheated on
you, if you're so against touching.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.368
You little fuck.
Do you get hit a lot?

40:39.960 --> 40:42.691
I don't know. I've had my share.

40:45.080 --> 40:47.447
Your friend is completely
retarded, you know that?

40:47.880 --> 40:50.406
Hey, man, my little
brother's retarded.

40:50.400 --> 40:53.165
Don't use that word in
a derogatory fashion.

40:55.520 --> 40:56.851
Oh.

40:58.080 --> 41:01.801
Psych. I don't have a retarded brother.
Sid, you suck.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.759
Speaking of retarded, do you
ever wish that, like...

41:08.760 --> 41:12.079
...retarded people or old
people would just hurry up?

41:12.080 --> 41:14.959
Like sometimes I'm waiting for
them to cross the street...

41:14.960 --> 41:17.725
...and I'm like,
"Come on, already."

41:17.720 --> 41:19.688
But then I feel bad.

41:29.680 --> 41:31.364
Dad?

41:31.360 --> 41:32.771
What?

41:33.760 --> 41:36.525
Don't forget that I
know where he lives.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.444
Get in the front seat.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.441
So you don't know anything
else about him...

41:46.442 --> 41:49.399
...like what he does or if
he's married or anything?

41:49.400 --> 41:53.121
Just his name. Brian Speer.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.610
Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark?

41:55.120 --> 41:57.009
- I just didn't.
- Why not?

41:57.010 --> 42:01.519
I didn't wanna get into it, that's all.
We'll Google him later.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.119
All right. Um...

42:04.120 --> 42:06.839
We're almost...
That's it, that's it, that's the one.

42:06.840 --> 42:08.524
Stop. The one with the turtle.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.329
That one? Yeah, yeah.

42:15.680 --> 42:17.967
There? He lives there?

42:17.960 --> 42:20.281
I can't say for sure
that he lives there...

42:20.282 --> 42:22.248
...but that's where I saw them.

42:23.640 --> 42:25.239
Should I ring the bell?

42:25.240 --> 42:30.239
No. This is stupid.
This is stalking or something. I...

42:30.240 --> 42:34.359
Okay, it's... We came, we saw.
That's enough. Let's go.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.806
Well, it's not like we're
stalking him exactly.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.802
What would you do if
you saw him, anyway?

42:51.800 --> 42:53.484
Talk to him? Punch him? What?

42:56.000 --> 42:58.128
I guess I just wanna see him.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.531
- Dad, Dad, stop, stop, stop.
- What, what?

43:22.520 --> 43:24.363
Go back, go back.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.241
- What?
- Just go back.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.642
What?

43:34.640 --> 43:37.041
Look, there he is.

43:46.360 --> 43:48.840
At least now we know
what he looks like.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.839
<i>Hi, this is Brian Speer
of Gold Coast Realty.</i>

44:07.840 --> 44:09.439
<i>Sorry I missed your call.</i>

44:09.440 --> 44:12.683
<i>Leave a message with your name,
number, and time that you called...</i>

44:12.680 --> 44:16.685
<i>...and I'll get back to you
just as soon as I can. Mahalo.</i>

44:18.320 --> 44:19.799
Hi, Brian.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.519
My name's Herb Fitzmorris...

44:21.520 --> 44:24.763
...and I'm interested in your
house on Koloa Street...

44:24.760 --> 44:27.923
...the one with the
cool fence and gate.

44:28.760 --> 44:32.207
I'm at 645-2796.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.690
Thank you.

45:20.800 --> 45:23.565
Girls, let me go in for just
a quick moment alone first

45:23.560 --> 45:25.244
I'll be right out.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.449
You were gonna ask
for a divorce...

45:38.450 --> 45:42.081
...so you could be with some
fucking fuckhead, Brian Speer?

45:42.080 --> 45:43.650
Are you kidding me?

45:45.120 --> 45:46.849
Who are you?

45:47.400 --> 45:50.609
The only thing I know for sure
is you're a goddamn liar.

45:53.960 --> 45:56.247
So, what do you have
to say for yourself?

45:57.040 --> 45:59.439
Why don't you go ahead and
make a little joke...

45:59.440 --> 46:01.439
...and tell me that
I got it all wrong?

46:01.440 --> 46:05.286
Tell me again that I'm too out
of touch with my feelings...

46:05.280 --> 46:07.851
...and I need to go to therapy.

46:09.000 --> 46:13.289
Isn't the idea of marriage to make your
partner's way in life a little easier?

46:13.280 --> 46:18.810
For me, it was always harder with you,
and you're still making it harder.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.882
Lying there on a ventilator
and fucking up my life.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.565
You are relentless.

46:27.720 --> 46:30.690
You know what? I was gonna ask
you for a divorce someday.

46:40.600 --> 46:42.728
Daddy's little girl.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.649
I'm gonna bring your
daughters in now.

46:49.280 --> 46:53.251
Alex is home from school.
Try to be nice, okay?

46:59.560 --> 47:01.449
All right, here we go.

47:09.520 --> 47:12.922
Okay? Hi, Mom. Look who's here.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.559
Say something, Alex.

47:29.560 --> 47:31.927
Tell her how you were
drunk the other night.

47:31.920 --> 47:35.481
- Tell her how maybe you're an alcoholic.
- Girls, be serious.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.690
Hi, Mom.

47:40.080 --> 47:42.287
Sorry for being bad.

47:44.400 --> 47:48.879
Sorry for wasting your money
on expensive private schools.

47:48.880 --> 47:51.719
Money you could have been using
on facials and massages...

47:51.720 --> 47:53.927
...and sports equipment.

47:53.920 --> 47:55.604
Sorry for everything. All right.

47:56.440 --> 47:59.239
I'm sorry we weren't good
enough for you, especially Dad.

47:59.240 --> 48:02.239
Stop it. That's out of line.
Or what? You gonna ground me?

48:02.240 --> 48:05.119
Ship me off to another boarding school?
Give me a time-out?

48:05.120 --> 48:06.645
I'll tell you what, goddamn it.

48:08.280 --> 48:10.442
You got served Scottie,
go in the hall.

48:10.440 --> 48:11.965
She's the one out of line.

48:11.966 --> 48:14.042
Go find Sid. He's smoking.

48:14.040 --> 48:18.329
I shouldn't be around second-hand smoke.
Go, let's go. Now, now, now, go.

48:19.760 --> 48:22.799
Did you spank me?
You have no right to talk to her that way.

48:22.800 --> 48:25.359
She's gonna die.
What if those were your last words?

48:25.360 --> 48:28.399
I have every right to speak to her that way.
I'm angry at her.

48:28.400 --> 48:30.919
How can you be so forgiving?
I'll be angry later.

48:30.920 --> 48:35.005
Let's just think about the good parts.
Don't say that stuff in front of your sister.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.446
Don't spoil her for Scottie.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.368
Say something different.

48:50.520 --> 48:54.366
Look, Mom, I know
that we fought a lot.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.685
I just...
I always wanted to be like you.

48:58.360 --> 49:02.410
I am like you.
I'm exactly like you.

49:05.400 --> 49:09.371
You are like her.
Mostly in good ways.

49:09.360 --> 49:12.762
Maybe some bad ways.
Remains to be seen.

49:16.400 --> 49:18.243
Yeah.

49:25.200 --> 49:29.039
Dad, this is Reina.
Reina, this is my sister and Sid.

49:29.040 --> 49:32.169
And that's my mom on the bed.
Hi, everybody.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.640
Hello. Hi.

49:40.520 --> 49:42.170
So this is your mother?

49:42.880 --> 49:45.079
I guess it's true.

49:45.080 --> 49:47.679
Should I shake her hand?

49:47.680 --> 49:50.126
If you want. No, thanks.

49:50.120 --> 49:54.170
So, uh, Reina, I understand that
your grandmother's not feeling well?

49:54.640 --> 49:56.079
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

49:56.080 --> 49:57.919
She got her stomach
operated on...

49:57.920 --> 50:00.810
...and then got some sort of
stupid infection or something.

50:00.800 --> 50:02.086
It's pretty gross.

50:02.400 --> 50:05.639
Hmm. Well, Reina, thank
you for stopping by.

50:05.640 --> 50:09.199
Scottie, let me give you some money,
and you two can get some ice cream.

50:09.200 --> 50:11.759
Too many carbs.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.842
Too many carbs?

50:13.840 --> 50:18.084
Well, you could go down to the
cafeteria and get some lettuce.

50:18.520 --> 50:22.439
That's okay. I'm done.
You weren't a liar after all.

50:22.440 --> 50:26.764
Don't you wanna hang out?
No, I should go. See you at the club.

50:26.760 --> 50:30.481
Hope your mom gets better.
Bye, everybody.

50:32.600 --> 50:36.119
Scottie, what did she mean by
"You aren't a liar after all"?

50:36.120 --> 50:40.319
What did she think you were lying about?
She didn't believe Mom was sleeping.

50:40.320 --> 50:42.971
So you had to prove to that
twat that Mom's in a coma?

50:42.960 --> 50:45.804
What the fuck is in your skull?
A bunch of stupid pills?

50:46.240 --> 50:48.279
Shut up, you motherless whore.

50:48.280 --> 50:49.486
Whoa, whoa.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.131
Easy there, half-pipe.
Where'd you learn to talk like that?

51:10.720 --> 51:13.326
Hello?

51:13.840 --> 51:17.639
No, this is the right number.
No, no, I'm his assistant, Sharon.

51:17.640 --> 51:20.166
- How may I help you?
- Who is it?

51:20.160 --> 51:22.162
Uh-huh.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.686
Oh.

51:25.920 --> 51:30.084
All right. All right, so one or the other?
Okay, I'll tell him. Mahalo.

51:31.960 --> 51:33.919
That was Bonnie
Tanaka, a realtor.

51:33.920 --> 51:37.199
She says that Mr. Speer is going to
be on Kauai for the next week...

51:37.200 --> 51:39.521
...but she'd be happy to
show you the house...

51:39.520 --> 51:42.285
...or you can stop by the
open house on Sunday.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.639
Hi, Mr. King.

52:15.640 --> 52:18.166
Hello, Buzz.
Sorry about Mrs. King.

52:18.160 --> 52:21.687
Hope she gets better real soon.
Thanks.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.685
It really blows.

52:25.480 --> 52:26.970
I know.

52:29.400 --> 52:33.928
<i>You've all asked questions about Elizabeth,
and I've given vague answers.</i>

52:34.440 --> 52:37.364
But I asked you all here
today to tell you...

52:38.400 --> 52:41.210
...that her coma is permanent.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.843
She's not gonna make it.

52:45.120 --> 52:49.170
So this week,
tomorrow, in fact...

52:50.000 --> 52:51.240
...as per her wishes...

52:51.241 --> 52:54.084
...we are going to unhook
her from life support.

52:58.680 --> 53:02.844
You all know Elizabeth.
She has to do everything on her own.

53:07.760 --> 53:10.286
I wanted to tell you
all in person...

53:11.360 --> 53:13.719
...because you are all
our dear friends.

53:13.720 --> 53:15.959
You're our best friends.

53:15.960 --> 53:19.328
The girls and I so much appreciate
everything you have done for us...

53:19.320 --> 53:21.448
...in the last few weeks.

53:21.960 --> 53:25.009
Bringing food and calling.

53:25.960 --> 53:29.879
Can we go see her? Yes.
Yes, for God's sakes, yes.

53:29.880 --> 53:33.168
That's the whole point.
Go see her as soon as possible.

53:33.160 --> 53:38.963
That's what I wanna tell you. All of you.
It should be now, not after.

53:40.720 --> 53:44.805
<i>Everyone who loves Elizabeth
deserves a chance to say goodbye.</i>

54:15.000 --> 54:16.968
<i>You've lost your mind.</i>

54:16.969 --> 54:19.850
You mean him?
Tell him to come say goodbye?

54:20.600 --> 54:21.931
I'll be gone a day or so.

54:21.932 --> 54:24.639
I'll leave in the morning,
I'll be back tomorrow night.

54:24.640 --> 54:26.159
If it takes another day, fine.

54:26.160 --> 54:29.209
I'll give it two days.
If I don't find him, at least I tried.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.361
Just drop it, Dad.

54:30.362 --> 54:35.207
You've got way bigger fish to fry
than confronting fucking Brian Speer.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.361
You're recording this?

54:37.520 --> 54:42.367
I'm summarizing a deposition.
How can you work at a time like this?

54:42.360 --> 54:45.603
How can you go to a movie?
To get Scottie out of the house.

54:46.040 --> 54:48.725
And you actually wanna tell
him to come back and see Mom?

54:50.200 --> 54:51.725
I think...

54:53.400 --> 54:55.801
I just think she'd
want him to know.

54:55.800 --> 54:59.361
Just call his office and
tell him it's an emergency.

55:00.560 --> 55:03.086
No. On the phone, he can escape.

55:03.080 --> 55:06.971
In person, he's got nowhere to go.
I wanna see his face.

55:10.480 --> 55:11.970
I wanna go too.

55:13.200 --> 55:17.888
No, you're gonna stay here with Scottie.
Fuck that. Let's all get out of town.

55:41.480 --> 55:43.847
Yo, Matt King.

55:45.240 --> 55:47.599
Hey, Ralph. Hey.

55:47.600 --> 55:51.559
Yeah, how's it? Great to see you. Good.
You remember your cousin Ralph.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.679
Yeah. Hey. Good to see you.
Oh, yeah, hi.

55:53.680 --> 55:56.399
What you guys doing here?
Came over for a day or two.

55:56.400 --> 55:58.402
I just got back from Kaho'olawe.
Yeah?

55:58.400 --> 56:01.085
Business over there.
So you here to talk to the cousins?

56:01.320 --> 56:03.288
Make sure everybody's
happy with your choice?

56:03.520 --> 56:04.806
Pay your respects to Hugh?

56:04.807 --> 56:07.439
No, just a little <i>holoholo</i>,
get the kids out of town.

56:07.440 --> 56:10.359
But it is Holitzer, right?
We all know it's Holitzer.

56:10.360 --> 56:12.362
Cousin Hugh wants him.
They go way back.

56:12.360 --> 56:13.964
I got my misgivings,
though, Matt.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.359
There's an argument to
be made to max it out.

56:16.360 --> 56:19.967
We only do this once in a lifetime.
I wanna work with you guys, I do.

56:19.960 --> 56:23.203
Whatever the majority decides after
the poll, I'll go along with it.

56:23.480 --> 56:25.287
Let's just get it
over with, you know?

56:25.288 --> 56:26.520
All right. Okay.

56:26.521 --> 56:28.559
How's Elizabeth doing?
She gonna be okay?

56:28.560 --> 56:31.119
The same.
Well, she's a tough gal, Matt.

56:31.120 --> 56:33.399
She'll be okay, yeah? Yeah.

56:33.400 --> 56:35.799
Where are you guys going?
Hanalei? Princeville.

56:35.800 --> 56:37.399
Come on, I'll give you a ride.

56:37.400 --> 56:38.606
Yeah? Yeah.

56:38.600 --> 56:40.409
- Come on, kids.
- Where are we going?

56:40.410 --> 56:42.880
Cousin Ralph's gonna
give us a ride.

56:59.400 --> 57:01.767
Hey, Ralph. Yeah?

57:02.040 --> 57:06.409
Turn off over here. Let's go see the land.
Take a last look, huh?

57:06.400 --> 57:09.768
You got time?
I got nothing but time.

57:30.920 --> 57:33.479
I think this is where the
golf course is gonna go.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.881
They want the golf course
to rival Pebble Beach.

57:35.880 --> 57:37.484
You know, bring in the big boys.

58:04.880 --> 58:08.168
Scottie. Come on, sweetheart.

58:25.480 --> 58:28.609
- Careful, Scottie.
- I got it.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.450
Look.

58:32.080 --> 58:35.402
Sometimes if you look out at
the coast, you can see whales.

58:38.200 --> 58:39.440
Are you shitting me?

58:40.000 --> 58:44.449
You guys own all this land?
Not personally. It belongs to a trust.

58:44.440 --> 58:46.568
But, yeah, it's ours
for a few more days.

58:47.200 --> 58:51.125
Big resort there on that point.
Commercial area there.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.963
Houses all through there.

58:53.400 --> 58:56.051
Part of me agrees with the
cousins that don't wanna sell.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.279
They're gonna make a
stink at the meeting.

58:58.280 --> 59:01.079
Yeah, but we have to.
The trust dissolves in seven years.

59:01.080 --> 59:03.839
If we don't sell, it's just
gonna be a train wreck.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.159
But it's a shame, yeah? Yeah.

59:06.160 --> 59:08.561
On the other hand, hey,
it's just sitting there.

59:08.560 --> 59:09.766
No one's using it.

59:09.767 --> 59:12.570
This way the whole world
will be able to enjoy it.

59:13.040 --> 59:15.319
Take a good look, girls.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.519
This is part of your great-great-
great-grandmother's inheritance...

59:19.520 --> 59:23.286
...going all the way
back to Kamehameha I.

59:23.280 --> 59:25.567
Down there is where
Mom and I would camp.

59:26.480 --> 59:28.642
We all did, all our lives.

59:29.240 --> 59:31.242
Lots of memories.

59:34.360 --> 59:36.567
Everything has its time.

59:38.280 --> 59:40.851
What about me? I wanna camp.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.882
I'm supposed to be meeting
a friend of mine.

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:40.684
I think he's staying here.
Uh, his name is Brian Speer. S-P-E-E-R.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.850
I'm sorry, Mr. King.
I'm not shown anybody by that name.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.842
Okay, thanks.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.079
Hey, Scottie.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:03.479
What's in your suit?
They're my beach boobs.

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:06.079
Take them out of there right now.
Jesus, Alex.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.242
Why would you let her do that?
You too, Sid.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:13.406
I don't know. Take them out, stupid.
Yeah, Scottie. Big boobs look kind of fatty.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.079
Any luck?

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:26.359
Well, the hotels were a dead end, but
I took another shot with his office.

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.761
He's definitely renting
a house in Hanalei.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.048
Probably one of the
cottages around the bay.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:36.407
I think we should go for a walk.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.768
Yeah, let's go. Scottie!

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.724
Can we swim with the sharks?

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.599
I read in the hotel magazine how they,
like, put you in a cage underwater...

01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:56.764
...and then you throw shark feed around,
and then the sharks swim right up to you.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.966
Can we do that?

01:01:57.967 --> 01:02:01.159
Scottie, we're not really
here to do stuff like that.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:02.491
SCOTTIE Oh.

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.801
Well, what are we
here to do, then?

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.409
How did you and Mom meet?

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:24.479
I was with a law-school buddy
of mine from the mainland.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.879
We were just coming in from paddling,
and your mom was on her way out.

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.839
And she looked at
me and she said:

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:32.479
"Do you think it's
gonna snow today?"

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.846
- Did you think she was pretty?
- Oh, she knocked me out.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.650
I like her stories, like how
she streaked at the wedding.

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:45.847
Oh, my God.
There's so many like that.

01:02:45.848 --> 01:02:48.923
And the time she beat a wild
pig with a shoe. Ha, ha.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.639
Your mom got chased
by a shark once.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:53.199
What? When was that?

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.522
We were with Mark and Kai, and
your mom was out surfing...

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:59.808
...and she saw a shark right
beneath her on a wave.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.969
Let's watch one of these.
No, we are not watching porn.

01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:23.042
Give me... No.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.364
Reina's dad watches porn.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.479
Reina calls them
masturbation movies.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:32.239
She plays them when her parents aren't
home, and one time invited boys over...

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.479
...to see if they
grew down there.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.159
One did. Reina sounds awesome.

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.719
Were you there?
Did you watch one of those movies?

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.769
No. Hey, Scottie.

01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:46.684
Reina's a fucked-up ho-bag, and
you need to stay away from her.

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.006
And she's going to be a methhead and
she's gonna get used by stupid guys.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.048
She's a twat. Say it.

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.766
She's a twat.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:59.246
- All right. Okay. All right, okay. Stop it.
- She's a twat, twat, twat.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.239
I don't get it.
I don't know what to do.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.679
These things she does,
what goes on in her head.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.839
You weren't like that.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.599
It'll go away. I'm not so sure.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:14.807
Look at the way you kids
talk in front of me.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.928
It's like you don't
respect authority.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:54.245
Hey.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:59.484
Hi. Coming to check
on me or something?

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.281
I've been having trouble sleeping lately.
Understandable.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.646
I'm worried about my daughters.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.007
I think there's something
wrong with them.

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:29.639
I mean, I used to do a bunch of
messed-up shit when I was a kid.

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:31.802
Still do.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.280
It's gonna get worse
after your wife dies.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.999
What's Alex think about
all this stuff going on?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.559
What's she say? She doesn't.

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.399
What do you mean?
I thought she talks to you all the time.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.799
We don't really talk
about our issues.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.406
We deal with our shit by
talking about other stuff...

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.890
...and having a good time.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:03.679
What would you do if you were me?
How would you handle my daughters?

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:06.968
How would you handle the situation
of this guy we're trying to find?

01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.166
I told you, man.

01:06:08.167 --> 01:06:11.960
I'd put his nuts on a dresser and
I'd beat them with a spiked bat.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.559
As for your daughters, I don't know.
Exchange them for sons, I guess.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:20.839
Well, I'd probably end up
with something like you.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:23.079
I'm not so bad. I'm smart.

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.719
You are about a hundred
miles from Smartville.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:29.959
No offense.
You are mistaken, counselor.

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:33.407
I'm smart and, you know,
I have good hygiene.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.050
I'm a decent guitar player.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.079
I'm a good cook.
I mean, I cook food all the time.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:42.607
I'm vice president of
the Punahou chess club.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.728
And I always have weed.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.569
Your mother must be very proud.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:53.239
It's possible.
I mean, she's been kind of busy lately.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:57.999
Yeah, what's she do, your mom?
She's a receptionist at a pet clinic.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:02.130
But lately she's been getting the
house together after my dad died.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.441
My dad died a few months ago.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.399
November 24th. Drunk driver.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:16.564
Actually, uh, both
drivers were drunk.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.130
Yeah.

01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:34.641
Good night, Sid.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.608
Night, boss.

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:43.486
I will see you in the morning.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.162
Stay in the zone. That means you, Skylar.
You too, Colt.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.491
Keep an eye on your sister.
I'll be right back.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.806
Looks like you got your
hands full with those two.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.679
Yeah.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.359
Yeah. Must keep you pretty busy.

01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:17.439
They're pretty nonstop, but
they're at a really fun age.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:20.639
How old are they? Eight and 10.

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.201
I've got two girls, 10 and 17.

01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.521
That whole nonstop thing,
that never changes.

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:30.567
Do you guys live here? On Oahu.

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.324
Oh, so do we.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.359
Hurry up.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.199
I thought I'd get the girls out
of town for a couple days.

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.283
Their mother's in the hospital.
I thought I'd give them a break.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.884
Oh, no.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:45.722
What's wrong, if you
don't mind my asking?

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:49.886
She was in a boating accident.
She hit her head a little too hard.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.166
Sailboat or one with a motor?

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.003
One with a motor.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:03.209
Good luck with that.
I wish her well.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.848
Not so far, Skylar!

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:12.241
So are you guys staying in
one of the cottages here?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.399
Yeah. My husband had
to come for work...

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.239
...so we thought we'd make
a little vacation of it.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:20.891
We know the owner, so...
Hugh King.

01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.689
That's right.
Yeah, he's my cousin.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.523
Oh. You probably know my
husband, then, Brian Speer?

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.328
No, I can't say I do.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.127
Oh, I just assumed. He's been...

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.249
Dad? Something bit me.

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:40.724
It was nice talking to you.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:43.441
You too. Take care.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.130
There's Cousin Hugh.
Grab that table and order me something.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.248
What do you want? Anything.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.759
Ha, ha. Hey, Hugh.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:49.639
Hey, Mattie boy.

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:52.879
What you doing here?
I didn't expect to see you until the meeting.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:55.919
I know. I'm getting the girls out of
the hospital for a couple of days.

01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.359
Oh. Is that, uh...?
It's Scottie and Alex.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.679
Oh. Big girls now. Yeah.

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.759
We just needed a little
change of scenery.

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.439
What you've been going through,
that's a tough deal.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.639
Yeah.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.639
But Elizabeth, hey, tough
gal, I'll tell you that.

01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:13.919
A fighter. She's gonna make it.
Get you a drink?

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.279
I'll have whatever you're having.
Julia.

01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.559
Hey.
Old-fashioned for my coz here.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.879
All right. Thanks.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:23.359
Ha, ha. Nice to see you, man.
You too.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.761
How you been otherwise?

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.966
Not much otherwise.

01:14:26.967 --> 01:14:30.559
Between business and the hospital, I'm
trying to keep my head above water.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.759
Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.479
Listen, I see that you have some
people staying at the cottage.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.959
Mattie, if I'd known you were coming,
I could've moved those people out.

01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.646
Not that at all. It's just, I was wondering
about the guy you're renting to.

01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.847
I think his name is Brian Speer?

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:48.529
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Real determined son of a bitch.

01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.683
He's Lou's sister's... Uh, no, no, wait.
Uh, Lou has a sister.

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:58.891
The sister's husband, uh, Lou's
brother-in-law, is cousins with that guy.

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.799
Yeah, who's Lou?
No, no, wait, wait.

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:06.559
You mean the cottages on the bay
or the cottage back by the trail?

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:09.239
The bay. The guy with the
wife and the two sons.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:13.159
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, determined son of a bitch.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.879
The point is, the guy that
we're doing business with...

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:18.599
...is that guy's
brother-in-law, works for him.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:23.839
What guy we're doing business with?
Who do you think? Don.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.439
Ha, ha. Who else? Holitzer.

01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.759
Holitzer?
That's what I'm saying.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.439
That's Don's brother-in-law
in the cottage.

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:34.319
Brian Speer? You don't know him?

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:37.159
I thought you'd know him.
He's a realtor out by you.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.239
So if we sell to Don...
Which we're gonna do, right?

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:44.039
I mean, that's what you want too.
Nice guy, Don. He'll do right by us.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.279
So then when Don develops,
resells, leases and all that...

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:53.679
...he's letting this brother-in-law handle
the transactions, a lot of them anyway.

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.999
Big score for that guy.

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:08.879
And sitting in with us this afternoon,
we are fortunate to have our nephew.

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.919
This is Keola, and, uh...
Hey, Hugh, what's he like?

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.919
Who? Brian Speer.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:20.322
What else you know about him?
Well, not much. He's lucky.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:24.325
That son of a bitch is gonna make a
shitload of money on commissions.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.841
Not if we don't
go with that bid.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.358
We all want Don.

01:16:32.359 --> 01:16:33.723
This <i>is</i> the way.

01:16:33.724 --> 01:16:35.609
You do too, Mattie.
You said as much.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.922
No, I understand.

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.524
You're right.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.370
<i>I went down to Texas</i>

01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.646
Hugh, it's good to see you.

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:54.359
You too. All right. Okay.

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.170
I'll see you at the meeting.
I'll be there.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.969
<i>This is the way</i>

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:10.119
<i>I'm just a Hawaiian cowboy.</i>

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:14.279
<i>Riding on the range every night.</i>

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:18.490
<i>The women are thicker
than cactus.</i>

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.927
<i>And I swear I'll never
ride this range again</i>

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.200
This place rocks. Totally.

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.684
Oh, we ordered you mahi.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.090
Great.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:06.679
So guess what. That woman at the
beach today, that was his wife.

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:08.279
Whose wife? Brian Speer.

01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.999
What? The hottie with the hat?
Yeah.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.439
Are you sure? Yeah.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:14.841
So he's married?

01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.330
Why didn't you say anything?

01:18:16.331 --> 01:18:19.719
It's him I wanna talk to, not her.
But I know where their cottage is.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.451
You do? Let's do it right now.
Let's knock on his door.

01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.408
That's what I'm saying.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:27.399
Don't do that, don't be excited.
This isn't fun.

01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:31.199
It's what we came here to do.
Right.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.439
So you talk to his wife
while I talk to him.

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.081
And you figure out a way to
distract Scottie and their kids.

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.923
Got it. Sid, come here.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.489
- Give him hell, boss.
- Come on, Sid.

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.965
Okay.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.519
I'm sorry for sucking you into this.
I should be doing it alone.

01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.841
It's selfish.
I'm the one who sucked you in.

01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.649
I'm the one who knew.

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.526
Oh.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.688
Don't be a pussy.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.167
Hi there.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.519
It's the guy from
the beach today.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.679
Oh, hello. Hi, yeah.

01:19:19.680 --> 01:19:24.999
You know, I'm such an idiot.
I just figured out, I do know your husband.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.599
My daughter and I were on
our way back from dinner...

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:30.251
...and we just thought we'd
stop by and say howdy.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:32.208
<i>Howdy ?</i> Great, come on up.

01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:36.839
Yeah. I'm Matt King,
and this is Alexandra.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.359
Hi.

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:41.919
Yeah, I thought that was you.
You've been in the paper so much lately.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.799
I figured you had to know Brian.
He's been pretty involved.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.399
Yeah, no, super involved.

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.051
Yeah, maybe we met in passing.
I don't know.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.881
I guess you guys are
deciding really soon?

01:19:50.882 --> 01:19:53.358
In the next couple of days, right,
you and your family meet?

01:19:53.359 --> 01:19:54.598
Mm. Sorry.

01:19:54.599 --> 01:19:56.329
That's probably a
conflict of interest.

01:19:56.330 --> 01:20:01.247
No, that's okay. You're right.
It's all gonna be over in a couple of days.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.039
Do you guys want some lasagna?
No, thanks, we just ate.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:07.168
Sure.

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:08.685
- Red wine, iced tea?
- Perfect.

01:20:08.686 --> 01:20:10.279
Hi.

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.319
Hey. Hey.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.399
Hi, I'm Brian. Brian.
We may have met before.

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.999
Matt King.
My wife is Elizabeth King.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.399
I think you may
have met her too.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.399
This is our daughter Alexandra.

01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:26.399
I was just gonna get
them some drinks.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.164
Good, good, good.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.925
- Do you want some help?
- No, no, no, I got it.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.922
Hi.

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.048
Elizabeth is dying.

01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:40.880
Oh, wait. Fuck you.
And she's dying.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:44.930
We unhooked her from the machines this morning.
She'll be dead in a few days.

01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.282
This is him? Mm-hm.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.922
Why would she go for him? Beats me.
Well, he's very articulate.

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:58.120
I'm sorry. I never thought
it would come to this.

01:20:58.121 --> 01:21:01.203
You're sorry that my mom's gonna die?
Sorry that you fucked her?

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.770
You sorry you
fucked over my dad?

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.959
I'm sorry for all of it.
Look, I'm not here to wreck your life.

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.559
I just wanna give you a
chance to go to the hospital.

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:13.201
Don't know how long you're staying, but
you could find an excuse to leave.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.611
You must be good at that.

01:21:14.612 --> 01:21:17.251
You could be alone with her
to say goodbye or whatever.

01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:19.919
You hear what I'm saying?

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:23.288
Okay, look, I can't have you here.
Do you understand that?

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.521
Here we go. Hey.

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.279
Thank you.
Everyone's so serious.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:32.799
Please tell me you weren't
talking about business.

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.279
- Ha, ha. Ah, we were talking about love.
- That's nice.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.399
Will you call the boys in?
Dinner's ready.

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:41.159
Oh, they're fine.
Let them play a while longer.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:45.559
- Come on. Catch.
- Hurry up. Catch it.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.199
Awesome cottage you're renting.
Yeah, you don't say.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:49.959
This is prime Hanalei location.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.479
I used to come here when I was a kid,
before it was a vacation property.

01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:58.479
Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt
Lillian built this back in the '20s.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.679
I haven't been inside in years.
Come on, we'll give you a tour.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:04.684
Maybe, Brian, you could give my
dad a walk down memory lane...

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:06.603
...and Julie and I
can chat out here.

01:22:06.604 --> 01:22:09.604
Oh, yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind.
Just a quick look.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.159
Yeah.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:16.119
Yes. It's not like we live
here or anything, but okay.

01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:17.439
Ah.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.761
Will you hold that for me? Mm.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.125
Let's go over here.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:28.930
- Have you guys traveled much?
- Not much.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.160
We kind of just stay...

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.679
...in the area of the islands...
Here it is.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.799
How'd you meet? I'm curious.

01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:39.999
I can't do this. Neither can I.
How'd you meet?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.810
I thought you said you
came here just to tell me.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.006
I changed my mind.

01:22:44.007 --> 01:22:47.083
And I can't very well ask
her the details, can I?

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.609
How'd you meet?

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.322
At What party? a party.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.561
A Super Bowl party.

01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.399
At the Mitchell's.

01:22:59.400 --> 01:23:02.839
Does that help? Does that make it better?
I'm doing you a favor here.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.571
I could go out there right
now and I could fuck you up.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.483
So get a better attitude.

01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.081
And then what?
How'd you get the nerve to ask her out?

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.241
Was it about the deal?

01:23:13.242 --> 01:23:16.839
Is that when you decided she was for you?
No. It's not what you think.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.239
It just happened.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.399
Nothing just happens.
Everything just happens.

01:23:21.400 --> 01:23:24.599
Ha, ha. Was she gonna leave me?

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:27.079
She would have.
But I didn't want that.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.919
That never would've happened.
I love Julie.

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.924
<i>I know I'll cry, I know he'll
leave I know he'll lie.</i>

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.763
Please don't tell her.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.840
Please.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:40.561
I don't know what I have
done, but I am so sorry.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.288
Did she say that she loved you?

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:49.679
<i>Flyin' into window panes.</i>

01:23:49.680 --> 01:23:54.208
<i>Changin' lanes And
it's all in vain.</i>

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.089
Do you love her?

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.239
You don't love her.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.479
You don't love her.
You were just using her to get to me.

01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:11.359
I told you, I wasn't
trying to get to you.

01:24:11.360 --> 01:24:14.759
It was an affair, an attraction.
It was sex.

01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:17.879
She got carried away with the
whole thing, and I went with it.

01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:20.611
At least, I didn't say no to
things that I should have.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.170
I love my family.

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.239
I guess it's all working out.

01:24:24.240 --> 01:24:28.159
Her lips are sealed, and you don't have
to go through the trouble of dumping her.

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:29.479
Hey, that is so unfair.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:35.279
I had... I have so much respect for her.
She's an amazing woman.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.930
<i>It just ain't fair</i>

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:38.843
I have one more
question for you.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.325
Yeah?

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.161
You ever been inside my bedroom?

01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:51.640
Once.

01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.483
Oh. Wow.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:59.645
You could've had the decency
to lie about that one.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:02.364
All right, twice.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.839
<i>Fools my eye Every time.</i>

01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:11.322
She's at Queen's Hospital
if you wanna say goodbye.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:13.846
That is really all I
came here to say.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:22.519
That's great.
All remodeled and new appliances. Nice.

01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:24.679
Alex, I think we
should get going.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:28.199
Well, hey, thanks for stopping by.
It was really nice to meet you both.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.965
Maybe I'll see you at the beach tomorrow.
Yeah, maybe.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.122
Nice to meet you. You too.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.519
Hey.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.919
When do you think he'll show up?

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.479
I have no idea.

01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:06.079
Was he sorry?
I hope he was sorry, man.

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:08.679
I mean, you could've told
his wife, and you didn't.

01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.279
I would've told her everything.

01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.601
I mean, that guy doesn't
know how lucky he is.

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.090
She deserves to know too.

01:26:14.091 --> 01:26:17.159
Otherwise she's just gonna be a
dumb bitch the rest of her life.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:20.079
Sid. I'm just saying.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.799
No need to get creepy about it.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.639
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's all behind us.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:30.239
Yeah, well, the one we have to worry
about telling things to now is Scottie.

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:31.810
Yeah.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.089
I asked Dr. Johnston to help me
break the news to her tomorrow.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:14.722
Dr. Johnston asked me to
come here to meet you today.

01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.566
And I've heard so many
wonderful things about you.

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:27.370
Your mother is going
to die very soon.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.327
Here we are.

01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:40.885
Hey.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.888
Hi, Barry. Hey.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:46.920
Hey. Hey.

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.684
- Hi, Alice.
- Hi, Uncle Barry.

01:28:48.685 --> 01:28:50.559
Good to see you.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:51.759
Scott.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.839
Hey, Tutu.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.599
Okay, Alex, why don't we...

01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.250
Alex, how are you, honey?

01:28:57.240 --> 01:28:59.766
...get some chairs
for Tutu, huh?

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.409
There you are again.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.079
So, what'd you decide?
Not much left to decide.

01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:21.163
We're just playing it by ear and
trying to keep her comfortable.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.607
I mean, what'd you decide about the buyer?
Who's your buyer?

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:27.363
How much you getting?

01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:31.159
Dad, I'm sure you'll be able to
read about that in the paper.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:33.879
I don't wanna read about it.
I wanna hear about it now.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:36.439
Let's not talk about this here.
This isn't the time.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:39.879
It's all the same to you.
A million here, a million there.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.008
It's just ironic, that's all...

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.608
...Elizabeth coming into this misfortune
just as you're coming into a fortune.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.119
She gave you everything, Matt.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.999
Good, happy home. Beautiful daughters.
What's your point?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.759
She wanted her own boat, she
should've had her own boat.

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.919
Something she would've been familiar with.
She wasn't driving.

01:29:58.920 --> 01:30:01.639
Her boat, somebody else's
boat, wouldn't have mattered.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.768
You're not gonna blame
me for this. Ah.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.330
Quibble about the details.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.040
She was a faithful, devoted wife.
She deserved more.

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:19.081
You're right, she deserved more.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:22.599
For chrissake, take
it easy on the man.

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:25.444
You know, my father has been
doing a really amazing job...

01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:27.647
...under these circumstances.

01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.362
Are we leaving?

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:42.408
No, Mama, not yet.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:51.687
Man, that guy is such a prick.

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:55.048
Is he always like that? Yeah.

01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.603
I love you.

01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:02.006
Yeah, we went.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.970
The villages we went to were
in between these corn fields.

01:34:07.480 --> 01:34:09.721
Suddenly, bam, hits the tree.

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.165
Work's going okay?

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.642
So you've gotta buy
what's there already.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.644
At all price ranges.

01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.000
Well, no surprise.

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:37.239
Other than the holdouts who don't
wanna sell at all, it's done.

01:34:37.240 --> 01:34:41.165
Holitzer. Chicago group a distant second.
Feels good.

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:45.449
Doing the right thing, Mattie.
At least there ain't gonna be any Walmart.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.204
All right.

01:34:48.960 --> 01:34:53.921
Now it's your call. We're all behind you.
Most of us, anyway.

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.685
Go ahead, captain.
Make it official.

01:35:09.920 --> 01:35:11.968
It's strange, is all.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.802
What's strange?

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:19.727
We didn't do anything to own this land.
It was entrusted to us.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.563
And now we're just...

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.449
I can't do it.
I'm not gonna do it.

01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.011
What do you mean?
I'm not gonna sign.

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:42.599
What are you doing, man?

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.650
We know you got a lot on your plate now,
but you're not gonna fuck this up for us.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.846
It's over.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.359
I don't want it to
go to Holitzer.

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.799
I don't want it to go to anyone.

01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.599
I wanna keep it.

01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.003
Your head's not right, Mattie.
Your head's not right.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.004
Want a couple of days to think about it?
Take a couple of days.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:05.970
I don't need a couple of days.

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:08.531
I have the authority, and
this is what I want.

01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.359
We have other businesses that we're
converting into corporations.

01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:15.682
We can figure this out.
You're the trustee, Mattie.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:18.445
You know better than anyone we
only have seven years left.

01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:22.362
Then I have seven years to
figure out how to keep it.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:32.363
We'll come after you, man.
Just because you're a fucking lawyer...

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.523
...doesn't mean the rest of us
will be afraid to come after you.

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.925
But nobody wants to do that.

01:36:40.080 --> 01:36:41.730
We're family.

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:46.682
People will be relieved, Hugh.
The whole state.

01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:49.399
- Oh, shit.
- I sign this document...

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:52.839
...and something that we were
supposed to protect is gone forever.

01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:54.919
Now, we're haole as shit.

01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:57.082
And we go to private
schools and clubs...

01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.607
...and we can barely speak
pidgin, let alone Hawaiian.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:05.559
But we've got Hawaiian blood,
and we're tied to this land.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.599
And our children are
tied to this land.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.879
Now, it's a miracle that for some
bullshit reason 150 years ago...

01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.399
...we own this much of
paradise, but we do.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:19.399
And for whatever bullshit
reason, I'm the trustee now...

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.039
...and I'm not signing.

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.610
I'm not signing it.

01:37:23.600 --> 01:37:27.525
So if you wanna sue me,
it'll just make us closer.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.124
All right.

01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:46.405
Listen up, everybody.
Hey, hey, hey.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:52.044
Cousin Mattie has
an announcement.

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:54.963
Get ready.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:38:59.810
Come in.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:18.730
Julie?

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.526
I know we just met...

01:39:20.527 --> 01:39:23.922
...but I've been thinking about you
guys a lot these last few days...

01:39:23.920 --> 01:39:25.888
...and, uh, I knew
your mom was here.

01:39:25.889 --> 01:39:28.565
I don't know, I just
felt I should come by.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.039
Well, you know Alex. Hi.

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.399
Hi. This is Scottie.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:36.599
And, Sid, this is Mrs. Speer.
Julie.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.887
Julie.
Were you friends with my mom?

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.807
No, I never met your mom,
but I know a lot about her.

01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.489
Listen, Julie, we really
appreciate you coming by...

01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.642
...and the flowers are lovely.

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.528
Hey, Scottie, Alex. What?

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.363
- Let's go to the cafeteria.
- Okay.

01:39:58.364 --> 01:40:01.759
Yeah, good idea.
Scottie. I'm coming.

01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:04.159
Hurry up, Scottie. Hi.

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:07.084
It only took me two seconds.

01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.162
Scottie. Coming.

01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:26.289
I'm not sure how much you know
about my wife's condition...

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.123
...but, uh, she's
gonna die very soon.

01:40:28.124 --> 01:40:31.602
And actually, that's
sort of why we're here.

01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.204
I know.

01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:36.286
That's why I came,
because I know.

01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:43.123
I came because Brian wouldn't,
and that just didn't seem right.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.044
I thought someone from
my family should come.

01:40:47.440 --> 01:40:49.239
So he told you.

01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:51.971
He was acting really weird
that night after you left...

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.964
...and then I just started
smelling it on him.

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.129
I'd already smelled it.

01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:04.480
I finally got it out of him, and we
have been going crazy ever since.

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.165
Not easy with the kids around.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.239
It's all just something I
could never have imagined.

01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:14.210
And then your family's
decision with the land...

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:17.727
...I think you're doing the
right thing, but Brian is...

01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.450
It's just so complicated
and confusing.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:24.010
I know.

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.049
I'm angry.

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:31.805
But I'm just so sorry.

01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:35.490
I can't imagine what you
must be going through.

01:41:35.480 --> 01:41:39.121
Do you mind if I say
something to her?

01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.766
Okay.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.929
Elizabeth, I'm Julie.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:02.207
I'm Brian's wife.

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.321
I just wanna tell you...

01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:13.884
I just wanna tell
you I forgive you.

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:22.642
I forgive you for trying
to take Brian away.

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:27.521
I forgive you for trying
to destroy my family.

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:31.959
Because I just...
I have to forgive you.

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:36.719
I just have to forgive you,
even though I should hate you.

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.479
Okay, okay, that's enough.
I just have to forgive you.

01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:42.165
Really, honestly, I think
that's enough, okay?

01:42:42.160 --> 01:42:44.561
Here we go. Thank you, Julie.

01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:49.169
Hey.

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:51.049
He didn't love her,
just so you know.

01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.602
He didn't really love her.

01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.930
That's why I came.

01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:02.442
Okay. Okay.

01:43:02.440 --> 01:43:03.930
There you go.

01:44:08.640 --> 01:44:10.688
Goodbye, Elizabeth.

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.487
Goodbye, my love.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.723
My friend.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:21.647
My pain.

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:24.768
My Joy...

01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:30.808
Good bye.

01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:33.449
Good bye.

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.929
Good bye.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:41.164
<i>Bye.</i>

01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:33.682
Well, I guess that's it.

01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:18.839
<i>There are few places harder
to get to in this world...</i>

01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:22.399
<i>...but there aren't any
where it's harder to live.</i>

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:25.239
<i>The average temperature here
at the bottom of the Earth...</i>

01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.322
<i>...is a balmy 58
degrees below...</i>

01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:29.400
- One strawberry.
- ...when the sun <i>is</i> out.

01:48:29.401 --> 01:48:30.604
One mocha chip.

01:48:30.605 --> 01:48:32.967
<i>It wasn't always like this.
Great.</i>

01:48:32.968 --> 01:48:35.679
<i>Antarctica used to be
a tropical place...</i>

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:38.799
<i>...densely forested and
teeming with life.</i>

01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:42.079
<i>But then the continent
started to drift south...</i>

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.242
<i>...and by the time it
was done drifting...</i>

01:48:44.243 --> 01:48:49.770
<i>...the dense forests
had all been ice.</i>

01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.327
<i>As for the former inhabitants, they'd
all died or moved on long ago.</i>

01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:00.961
<i>Well, almost all of them.</i>

01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:06.119
<i>The emperor penguin is
technically a bird...</i>

01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:09.919
<i>...although one that makes
his home in the sea.</i>

01:49:09.920 --> 01:49:12.879
<i>So if you're wondering what he's
doing up here on the ice...</i>

01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:16.079
<i>...well, that's
part of our story.</i>

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.447
<i>Each year at around
the same time...</i>

01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:20.841
<i>...he will leave the comfort
of his ocean home...</i>

01:49:20.842 --> 01:49:23.319
<i>...and embark on a
remarkable journey.</i>

01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:25.919
<i>He will travel a great distance.</i>

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:28.969
<i>And though he is a
bird, he won't fly.</i>

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:32.521
<i>Though he lives in the
sea, he won't swim.</i>

01:53:22.120 --> 01:53:26.599
<i>Mom, I love you.</i>

01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:32.719
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:37.239
<i>Wait for me, Mom.</i>

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:40.084
Be home real soon.

01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:42.686
<i>Real soon.</i>

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:48.079
<i>I never knew.</i>

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:54.439
<i>How much you meant to me.</i>

01:53:54.440 --> 01:54:01.239
<i>Now that I'm so many miles away.</i>

01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:04.759
<i>From you.</i>

01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:09.479
<i>Only God knows.</i>

01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:15.439
<i>When and where we'll meet again.</i>

01:54:15.440 --> 01:54:20.159
<i>To hold you in my arms.</i>

01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:25.959
<i>Once more.</i>

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:31.119
<i>To hear your voice.</i>

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:36.559
<i>To see your smile.</i>

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:41.599
<i>Oh, God, do please.</i>

01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:47.607
<i>Keep my mom.</i>

01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:54.609
<i>Please keep my mom</i>
