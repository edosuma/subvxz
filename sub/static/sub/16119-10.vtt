00:03.071 --> 00:04.405
JOE: Hey, yo, man, wake up.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.008
Hey, man, you gotta get up,
aight?

00:08.042 --> 00:09.477
You gotta leave.
It's getting late.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.380
(bottles and cans clattering)

00:13.614 --> 00:15.149
Wh--

00:15.183 --> 00:16.417
What time is it?

00:16.450 --> 00:18.486
It's like noon.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.354
Look, the party was straight
and everything,

00:20.388 --> 00:22.856
but now I got to clean up
all this shit.

00:22.890 --> 00:23.857
(chuckles)
I mean, it's like

00:23.891 --> 00:25.326
I know y'all,

00:25.359 --> 00:26.727
but I don't know y'all,
you know?

00:26.760 --> 00:28.429
I mean, we cool,

00:28.462 --> 00:31.432
but we ain't cool.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.566
(bottles clang)

00:32.600 --> 00:34.602
Where is Alfred?

00:34.635 --> 00:35.769
Who?

00:35.803 --> 00:36.837
Al.

00:36.870 --> 00:37.905
Paper Boi.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.707
Oh, he dipped
a while ago.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.276
You know, it's like
y'all my niggas,

00:42.310 --> 00:43.844
but y'all ain't my niggas.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.679
I mean it's like
I know y'all,

00:45.713 --> 00:47.215
but I don't know y'all,
man.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.418
(bottles clang)

00:50.451 --> 00:52.953
Where's my jacket?

00:52.986 --> 00:55.022
JOE:
People just tearing up shit.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.525
Somebody poured a beer
in my Brita pitcher.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.760
I mean it's like
I fuck with y'all,

00:59.793 --> 01:01.729
but I don't fuck with y'all,
man!

01:01.762 --> 01:03.397
It's a...

01:03.431 --> 01:06.066
It's like a--
a blue bomber jacket.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.801
-Have you seen it?
-Nah.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.069
But I did see when somebody

01:09.103 --> 01:11.205
tried to light my trash can
on fire.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.406
(bottles clang)

01:12.440 --> 01:14.108
-What?
-Yeah.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.776
It's all burned up
on the inside.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.111
(chuckles)
I mean, I was gonna

01:17.145 --> 01:18.312
get another one anyway,
but--

01:18.346 --> 01:20.080
but that's besides
the point.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.316
I mean, it's like
we boys, but--

01:22.350 --> 01:24.152
But we ain't boys.
Yeah, I get it.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.720
Have you seen--
it's got a patch on it.

01:26.754 --> 01:27.721
You know?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.490
Like a seal--

01:29.523 --> 01:31.225
Can we hurry up
and get some food?

01:31.259 --> 01:34.162
I'm, like, dying.

01:34.195 --> 01:37.097
(women indistinctly arguing
outside)

01:46.840 --> 01:47.941
("Broccoli"
by D.R.A.M. playing)

01:47.975 --> 01:49.443
* Hey, lil' Mama

01:49.477 --> 01:51.445
* Would you like to be
my sunshine? *

01:51.479 --> 01:52.913
* Nigga touch my gang
we gon' turn this shit *

01:52.946 --> 01:54.482
* To Columbine *

01:54.515 --> 01:55.583
* Hey, hey

01:55.616 --> 01:58.118
(line trilling)

01:58.152 --> 01:59.587
Hey.
What's up, Al?

01:59.620 --> 02:03.090
Um, did you pick up my jacket
yesterday?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.425
(indistinct speech over phone)

02:04.458 --> 02:05.959
Dang.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.861
No, I just--I just thought
maybe you picked it up.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.263
Um...

02:09.297 --> 02:10.798
I'm just gonna--

02:10.831 --> 02:12.866
I'm gonna retrace my steps,

02:12.900 --> 02:13.867
try and see if I can find it.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.436
All right?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.437
All right, cool.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.805
Peace.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.716
Free chicken sandwich day,
nigga.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.860
(music playing inside)

02:46.400 --> 02:48.869
-Hey, what's--
-Listen, you owe me $10, man.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.904
No, I mean--
I was here last night.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.706
I think I left my jacket
in there.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.475
Still got to
charge you ten.

02:54.508 --> 02:57.010
Come on, man,

02:57.044 --> 02:58.579
Can't you just look?

03:01.081 --> 03:02.550
(hip-hop music playing)

03:02.583 --> 03:04.151
Nope.
Didn't see it.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.854
W--

03:06.887 --> 03:08.422
I really need this jacket.

03:12.260 --> 03:15.128
(music continues)

03:22.536 --> 03:24.204
Nah, man.
It ain't here.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.084
Enjoy.

03:37.117 --> 03:40.020
* Flippin' all night, boy,
I'll be flippin' all night *

03:40.053 --> 03:44.057
* After I flip all night, boy,
I'll be flippin' all night *

03:44.091 --> 03:46.394
* Flippin' all night, boy,
I'll be flippin' all night *

03:46.427 --> 03:48.896
Hey, honey.
You want a dance?

03:48.929 --> 03:51.365
Uh, no, actually,
I was here last night.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.933
I'm--I'm just lookin'
for my jacket.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.234
Oh, with Paper Boi?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.103
I heard he was in here.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.137
Yeah, exactly.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.205
I'm--I'm his manager.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.040
(scoffs)
Oh, really?

04:00.073 --> 04:02.142
Y'all need a girl
for a music video?

04:02.175 --> 04:03.210
'Cause I'll do it.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.078
Uh, nah.
Maybe.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.280
I'll keep you in mind.

04:06.314 --> 04:07.581
Okay, don't lie to me.

04:07.615 --> 04:08.982
I'm--I'm not lying to you.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.584
Look,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.421
are any of the girls
from last night here right now?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.255
One of them might have
my jacket.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.223
Okay, what she look like?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.091
She--
she was blonde.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.293
She had blonde hair.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.394
Was it short blonde hair?

04:20.428 --> 04:23.130
Uh...
No, it was--

04:23.163 --> 04:25.766
it stopped at, like,
her...shoulders.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.501
Nah.
Well, wait.

04:27.535 --> 04:28.936
She like a hot yellow broad?

04:28.969 --> 04:31.972
She was
kind of light-skinned,

04:32.005 --> 04:33.807
but not--
not super light-skinned.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.776
Okay, was she thick?
Was she skinny?

04:35.809 --> 04:38.111
She was pretty thick.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.013
Big titties?

04:40.047 --> 04:41.615
Not the biggest titties.

04:41.649 --> 04:42.983
Like, they were--
they were--

04:43.016 --> 04:44.352
they were pretty big, yeah.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.786
Was she tall
with a fat ass?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.154
Kind of.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.656
I don't know.
She--

04:48.689 --> 04:49.757
She was like her.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.759
She l--
she looked like her.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.026
Nigga, them titties ain't big.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.662
I--whatever.
I don't--

04:54.695 --> 04:56.664
I don't know
the titty median here.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.332
I've been working here
for two years,

04:58.366 --> 05:00.033
and I ain't never seen nobody
that look like that.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.034
Sorry.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.035
Aight.
It's cool.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.036
Thanks.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.037
Uh, wait a minute.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.473
You just gonna leave

05:05.506 --> 05:06.840
and not take my phone number
for the music video?

05:06.874 --> 05:09.343
Oh.

05:09.377 --> 05:12.480
Uh, yeah.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.448
See, you think
I'm playin'.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.283
-I'm so serious.
-I know.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.686
-You better call me.
-Okay.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.626
Told ya.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.529
(music playing inside)

05:37.871 --> 05:42.209
(cell phone unlocks, clicks)

05:42.242 --> 05:44.344
Shots gon' make this night!

05:44.378 --> 05:45.713
Tittys and bittys
and tittys.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.515
Tittys
and bittys and tittys.

05:47.548 --> 05:49.583
Tittys and bittys
and--no, not--

05:49.617 --> 05:51.685
(indistinct chatter)

05:51.719 --> 05:53.754
I hate shots.
You know that, right?

05:53.787 --> 05:56.757
(hip-hop music playing)

05:56.790 --> 05:58.225
*

05:58.258 --> 06:00.360
-Hey.
-What you doing?

06:00.394 --> 06:03.263
(indistinct chatter, cheering)

06:08.536 --> 06:10.170
Gotta get in the Uber!

06:10.203 --> 06:11.705
-Whoo!
-(laughs)

06:11.739 --> 06:13.240
-I got shotgun.
-I got shotgun, nigga.

06:13.273 --> 06:14.942
-I got the front.
-Man.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.577
That's right, man,
to the back.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.278
Hey, man.
Hey, what's your name, man?

06:18.311 --> 06:19.913
What you doin'?

06:19.947 --> 06:21.381
My baby mama's cousin
gonna drop me off.

06:21.415 --> 06:22.950
This nigga, man.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.718
Hey!

06:24.752 --> 06:25.853
(Nelly's "Ride Wit Me" playing)

06:25.886 --> 06:28.088
This is Beyoncé's best song.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.858
Nigga...
(laughs)

06:30.891 --> 06:32.359
But I stay gold!

06:32.392 --> 06:34.361
-* In the back of the Doz-E
-Hey!

06:34.394 --> 06:36.196
* Oh, why
do I feel this good? *

06:36.229 --> 06:38.732
all:
* Hey, must be the money!

06:38.766 --> 06:40.801
(all barking)

06:40.834 --> 06:41.969
Yeah, yeah!

06:42.002 --> 06:43.571
(all barking)

06:43.604 --> 06:45.939
* Yeah, yeah
(all barking)

06:45.973 --> 06:48.609
What if we found out
Ja Rule was just a dog?

06:48.642 --> 06:49.977
(laughter)

06:50.010 --> 06:51.144
-Like, he's just--
-Like--

06:51.178 --> 06:53.146
(indistinct noises from video)

06:53.180 --> 06:54.915
-Nigga, grunk!
-Look at this shit.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.050
-I wanna see--
-Oh! Watch what they doin'--

06:57.084 --> 06:58.786
(hip-hop music playing)

06:58.819 --> 07:00.654
Hey, come on!

07:00.688 --> 07:02.656
I said it. Look at that.
Look at that. Look at that.

07:02.690 --> 07:07.661
No. No, you don't understand.
It takes your soul, man.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.997
(hip-hop music from phone)

07:15.836 --> 07:18.706
(humming)

07:21.475 --> 07:24.011
Yo!
E-money.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.146
-Hey.
-What it be like?

07:26.179 --> 07:27.748
-Hey, guys.
-Sup, bro?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.149
Sup?

07:29.182 --> 07:32.152
Thanks for waking me up
this morning.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.454
We didn't wake you up.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.024
Yeah, I know.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.458
(sighs)

07:38.492 --> 07:40.861
I woke up at 11:30
with Joe screaming at me.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.930
-Word?
-Yeah, he was pretty mad.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.197
Why?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.833
'Cause we, like,
ruined his house.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.135
Like, we set, like, a trash can
on fire or something?

07:48.168 --> 07:49.136
-Right.
-(laughs)

07:49.169 --> 07:50.137
Oh, yeah, that did happen.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.805
-Yeah.
-Yep.

07:51.839 --> 07:52.840
Hey, that girl, Kim,
threw that blunt in the trash.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.274
-Mm.
-(laughs)

07:54.307 --> 07:56.143
-Man, we was drunk as hell.
-That was cold.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.444
Yeah, well, he's pissed.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.047
Well, so what?
Fuck him, man.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.715
I can barely remember
last night, man.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.517
Well, you don't need to.
You Snapchatted the whole thing.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.718
Uh, yup.

08:04.752 --> 08:05.986
How else we gonna
let niggas know

08:06.019 --> 08:07.387
how we livin' out here?

08:07.420 --> 08:08.789
(chuckles)
Most of this rap shit

08:08.822 --> 08:09.823
is appearances, right?

08:09.857 --> 08:11.324
Yeah, appearances of money.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.160
Look, we need to start
stuntin' on niggas more.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.528
All right?

08:14.562 --> 08:16.063
That's what we need to do, bro.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.665
Stunting's a kind of a trap.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.066
We should probably
make a little bit more money

08:19.099 --> 08:20.233
before we start showing it off.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.468
Oh, my God, man.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.704
How you suck the fun
out of everything.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.838
See, that's--
that's black people's

08:24.872 --> 08:26.173
number one problem.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.407
Man, they don't know
how to have fun.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.176
I really disagree

08:29.209 --> 08:30.878
with that being black people's
number one problem.

08:30.911 --> 08:32.212
-See how he goes?
-You know what I think?

08:32.245 --> 08:33.981
I think if we spent
the time we spend

08:34.014 --> 08:36.349
thinking about not spending
money, spent that time

08:36.383 --> 08:39.386
on spending money,
then it'd be time well spent.

08:39.419 --> 08:42.389
But all the rest of that--
you know, I--

08:46.293 --> 08:47.895
Here, let me see your phone.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.763
I need to contact that
Uber driver from last night.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.766
I think he's got my jacket.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.967
Thanks.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.840
Don't flip through
my photos, man.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.241
Let me get some of them, man.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.409
Mm-hmm.

Yeah.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.449
Speaking of money,

09:09.482 --> 09:12.385

seed companies make money?

09:12.419 --> 09:13.854

09:44.584 --> 09:46.386
I don't know if I want
no sushi seeds, man.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.755
No, they're delicious.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.657

-I think it's a bigger issue...
-Uh, all right.

10:04.304 --> 10:05.839

Man, you didn't even
bail my ass out

11:02.863 --> 11:04.397

11:04.431 --> 11:05.799
What do you mean, "I guess"?

11:05.833 --> 11:07.400
I guess we're

11:07.434 --> 11:09.737
Oh, hey, man, we can go

11:44.437 --> 11:46.239
Well, call his ass again.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.847
Where did you learn

party was crazy last night.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.853
I will. I will.
I will. I will.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.888
Hey, what's up,
Vanessa?

19:48.921 --> 19:50.423
(chuckles)

19:50.457 --> 19:51.724
Hi, Justin.

19:51.758 --> 19:52.925
How you doin'?
(chuckles)

19:52.959 --> 19:54.561
Lookin' all--
hey, look,

19:54.594 --> 19:56.329
if y'all ever break up--
would that be weird?

19:56.363 --> 19:57.664
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.732
-Call me "Swift," baby.
-I will.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.734
-She got a sister?
-Nah.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.974
Mm.

20:10.743 --> 20:13.212
So y'all were wasted last night?

20:15.147 --> 20:17.216
Kinda.

20:17.250 --> 20:18.885
Not really.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.588
(groans)

20:21.621 --> 20:23.490
Oh, by the way...

20:25.792 --> 20:28.395
This is for you.

20:28.428 --> 20:30.196
What is that?

20:30.229 --> 20:34.066
It's that thing
we always need.

20:34.100 --> 20:37.437
(laughs)

20:37.470 --> 20:39.739
You a drug dealer now?

20:39.772 --> 20:42.475
(laughs)

20:42.509 --> 20:44.877
Earn, are you kidding me?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.546
(laughs)

20:46.579 --> 20:48.615
-Are you--
-Oh, my God.

20:48.648 --> 20:51.418
-Yo, you are fucking wack.
-You looked so sad.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.286
You looked so sad.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.387
I'm really flattered...

20:54.421 --> 20:55.588
(laughs)

20:55.622 --> 20:57.490
That you think
I could sell drugs.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.091
No, I'm not--
come on.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.227
You think I really
could do that?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.895
I'd be so bad at it.

21:02.929 --> 21:06.399
(laughs)

21:06.433 --> 21:07.500
I hate you.

21:07.534 --> 21:10.837
I know.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.605
(sighs)

21:12.639 --> 21:15.207
You're a good daddy,
though.

21:38.731 --> 21:43.002
You know you can stay
the night, right?

21:43.035 --> 21:45.204
Yeah.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.340
It's cool, though.

21:47.374 --> 21:50.343
I'll come back tomorrow.

21:50.377 --> 21:51.711
Okay.

21:55.515 --> 21:58.017
Okay.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.220
All right.
Have a good night.

22:01.253 --> 22:02.822
You too.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.633
Call you tomorrow.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.868

22:15.902 --> 22:17.036
