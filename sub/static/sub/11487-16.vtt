00:25.600 --> 00:28.398
-What are you making?
-Breakfast.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.074
Have you considered orange juice
and a piece of toast?

00:31.520 --> 00:32.747
lt's in there.

00:34.840 --> 00:36.068
We got any marshmallows?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.470
And he wonders why he gets diarrhea.

00:43.520 --> 00:45.988
Oh, man.

00:48.400 --> 00:50.356
Did you forget to put the lid on again?

00:51.160 --> 00:52.957
Maybe.

00:54.040 --> 00:57.350
-Well, clean it up.
-Okay.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.189
-ls Jake up yet?
-He's in the kitchen.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.796
-Has he been looking for me?
-Are you a marshmallow?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.432
-What?
-He hasn't been looking for you.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.874
Oh, good.

01:11.040 --> 01:13.634
Sorry l'm late,
but Kandi and l had morning sex.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.234
-Good for you.
-Twice.

01:17.080 --> 01:18.069
Congratulations.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.708
She didn't even wake me up
for the first one.

01:21.600 --> 01:22.794
l almost missed it.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.475
Well, l've always said a 22-year-old girl
is like a good carpenter.

01:26.640 --> 01:28.631
No wood gets wasted.

01:32.920 --> 01:35.354
Well, l wouldn't put it so crudely,
but yeah.

01:43.560 --> 01:46.154
-Morning, buddy.
-Morning.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.112
Why do you let him use the blender?

01:52.280 --> 01:55.590
l'm hoping
he'll eventually stumble into a margarita.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.077
Hey, here's a fun fact.

01:59.240 --> 02:02.789
You're sleeping with a girl who was born
when you were in junior high.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.669
And yet there's a good chance
she lost her virginity before you did.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.317
And here's another fun fact.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.392
l'll bet she's had sex
with more girls than you too.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.592
That is a fun fact.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.635
And you know what else?
Her youth is like an aphrodisiac.

02:27.800 --> 02:32.032
l feel younger, l feel more. . . .
Oh, l don't know how to describe it.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.191
Manly.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.509
l know what you mean.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.830
l'm performing
at what can only be described. . .

02:38.000 --> 02:39.592
. . .as a very enhanced level.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.433
-Right.
-You know, between-the-sheets-wise.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.989
-You don't have to tell me.
-Yes, l do.

02:46.840 --> 02:48.910
l have to tell everybody.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.351
l'm just impressed
you can keep up with her.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.080
l thought she'd have worn you down
to a few vertebrae. . .

02:54.240 --> 02:55.673
. . .in a pool of spinal fluid.

02:55.840 --> 02:59.071
Well, you know, l exercise, l eat right--

02:59.240 --> 03:02.835
And of course, l've always had a vast,
untapped reservoir of sexual energy. . .

03:03.000 --> 03:04.991
. . .bubbling under the surface.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.116
Truth be told, you could drill anywhere
and hit a gusher.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.629
Morning, brother.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.756
We're here to tell you
about The Good News.

03:13.920 --> 03:15.273
Okay, but my news first.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.591
See, l am dating
this 22-year-old woman.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.958
lncredible.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.716
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey, Rose, what's up?

03:50.880 --> 03:53.269
l was taking a walk on the beach
with my boyfriend. . .

03:53.440 --> 03:55.192
. . .and we thought we'd stop by.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.476
Come on up, lamb chop.

03:58.520 --> 04:00.272
This is ridiculous.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.557
l still don't understand
why we can't use the stairs over there.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.439
-Don't try to change me, Gordon.
-l'm sorry.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.068
So how's it going with you two?

04:09.240 --> 04:12.152
lt's just great. Gordon's my soul mate.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.756
-He completes me. We're inseparable.
-Yeah.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.149
Wait here.
l wanna talk to Charlie alone.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.950
-Charlie.
-Coming.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.194
-Lamb chop?
-l'm hot and juicy.

04:33.880 --> 04:37.111
-What's up?
-Don't play innocent with me.

04:37.280 --> 04:40.909
-l can see the hurt in your eyes.
-What?

04:41.080 --> 04:44.914
-You have to let me go, Charlie.
-Okay.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.635
-l'm with Gordon now. l've moved on.
-Good.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.958
And l know it may be hard for you
to hear this. . .

04:53.120 --> 04:55.759
. . .but he satisfies all my needs.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.350
Well, he is hot and juicy.

05:03.000 --> 05:06.913
Oh, Charlie.
l can't bear to see you like this.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.195
Like what?

05:09.120 --> 05:11.076
l know l shouldn't. . .

05:11.240 --> 05:13.549
. . .but l'm gonna give you
one last chance.

05:13.720 --> 05:15.631
One last chance for what?

05:16.240 --> 05:18.708
You're gonna make me say it,
aren't you?

05:19.960 --> 05:21.632
Say what?

05:22.720 --> 05:26.474
Listen closely. Once l go, l'm gone.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.073
Really?
l've never seen that side of you.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.315
l've never had a man like Gordon.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.028
l believe you.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.990
-So?
-''So,'' what?

05:44.920 --> 05:48.674
-Who's that?
-Oh, that's Gordon, my boyfriend.

05:49.520 --> 05:51.431
How come he's not allowed in?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.989
l'm trying
to avoid an awkward situation.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.470
-Too late.
-You bringing him to my birthday party?

05:58.520 --> 06:01.592
What do you think, Charlie?
ls the wound too fresh?

06:02.640 --> 06:05.074
l think l can handle it.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.037
Cool.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.436
-Okay. l'm gonna go now.
-All right.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.159
But before l do. . .

06:13.320 --> 06:15.754
. . .l think we need to decide
just where we stand.

06:23.480 --> 06:26.517
-You're kidding. Rose has a boyfriend?
-Yep.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.910
A real one,
or, like, Toby the astronaut?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.318
No, this one's real.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.596
-What's he like?
-Nice guy.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.752
He has no idea how close he is
to the woodchipper.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.236
-Hello? Alan, you home?
-Kandi?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.674
What are you doing here?

06:42.840 --> 06:45.400
l thought l'd surprise you
with a booty call.

06:46.640 --> 06:50.030
-Lower your voice.
-Booty call.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.349
What's a booty call?

06:53.600 --> 06:55.556
Well, it's. . . .

06:56.600 --> 07:00.912
You know, this is more the kind of thing
a son should learn from his father.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.832
Oh, okay.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.751
Maybe you should ask him now.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.029
All right.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.393
l'm going to hell.

07:12.440 --> 07:15.477
Look, it's a really sweet gesture,
but this is not a great time.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.073
Hey, Dad, what's a booty call?

07:18.320 --> 07:20.515
Oh, hey. Hey, Jake.
You-- You remember Kandi.

07:20.680 --> 07:21.954
-Sure. Hi, Kandi.
-Hi.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.793
So, what's a booty call?

07:27.720 --> 07:31.998
l figured you didn't want me telling him.
Was l wrong?

07:38.080 --> 07:41.197
Well, Jake, it means. . .

07:42.400 --> 07:46.712
. . .that Kandi came by
to do her laundry.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.115
l don't see any laundry.

07:55.320 --> 07:57.231
Good point, Charlie.

07:57.400 --> 08:00.312
Always the eye for detail.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.593
Well, you see, Jake. . .

08:08.760 --> 08:09.875
. . .in the Old West. . .

08:11.720 --> 08:15.030
. . .cowboys could be out
on the dusty range. . .

08:15.200 --> 08:16.792
. . .for months at a time.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.509
And they'd get mighty dirty.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.797
So they'd-- They'd mosey into town. . .

08:23.960 --> 08:26.110
. . .with nothing
but the clothes on their backs.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.350
And they'd need to wash them.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.192
So, what they'd do is. . .

08:30.880 --> 08:35.111
. . .they would go down to the creek. . .

08:36.880 --> 08:41.032
. . .and strip down until they were
wearing nothing but their boots.

08:43.039 --> 08:45.600
Why'd they keep their boots on?

08:51.200 --> 08:52.349
Rattlesnakes.

08:55.440 --> 08:59.718
Anyway, in order to warn people
who were swimming. . .

08:59.880 --> 09:03.111
. . .that, you know,
the naked cowboy was on his way. . .

09:03.280 --> 09:07.239
. . .he would yell, or, if you will, call:

09:07.760 --> 09:09.398
''Booty.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.598
Booty. ''

09:15.920 --> 09:17.592
Ergo, the booty call.

09:18.400 --> 09:20.914
Alan, you really make history fun.

09:22.800 --> 09:23.789
Well, thank you.

09:23.960 --> 09:27.350
So when did it start meaning
''casual sex''?

09:31.920 --> 09:34.559
Why don't you go play a video game
or something?

09:34.720 --> 09:36.517
-Okay.
-Great.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.514
Hey, Kandi, you wanna come
to my birthday party tomorrow?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.636
-Sure. How old are you gonna be?
-Twelve.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.109
Happy bar mitzvah.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.952
Well, this works out well.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.351
When you're not boinking her,
she's got someone to play with.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.029
Weren't you listening?

09:54.200 --> 09:56.873
Jake just invited Kandi
to his birthday party.

09:57.040 --> 09:59.759
Oh, don't worry.
You've still got the inside track.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.478
No.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.110
-l can't let her come to the party.
-Why not?

10:04.640 --> 10:07.552
Why not?
My ex-wife is gonna be there.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.917
All her miserable, middle-aged
soccer-mom friends are gonna be there.

10:11.080 --> 10:14.516
They're gonna take one look
at Kandi's tight, young little body. . .

10:14.680 --> 10:19.310
. . .and they are gonna hate me,
hate me with a white-hot hatred. . .

10:19.480 --> 10:21.357
. . .of burning. . .

10:21.760 --> 10:22.829
. . .hate.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.110
Yeah, sure,
it'll be a little tense at first. . .

10:26.280 --> 10:28.748
. . .but you can lighten the mood
with your booty story.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.555
That's powerful funny, partner.

10:33.440 --> 10:34.429
Shut up.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.550
Alan, there comes a time
in every man's life. . .

10:40.720 --> 10:42.199
. . .when he has to make a choice.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.715
Does he wanna be loved
or does he wanna get laid?

10:44.880 --> 10:47.235
Fourteen years ago
you made the wrong choice.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.270
You got married.
And you wound up with neither.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.869
But now, now fate has given you
another chance.

10:57.040 --> 10:59.429
Welcome it. Embrace it.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.512
Grab its pert little ass.

11:02.680 --> 11:05.558
What am l supposed to do,
walk into my son's birthday and say:

11:05.720 --> 11:08.871
''Hey, look at this gorgeous 22-year-old
woman l'm having sex with''?

11:09.040 --> 11:12.237
Oh, don't be silly.
You don't wanna rub their faces in it.

11:12.400 --> 11:15.312
You just want them to know
where yours has been.

11:18.840 --> 11:21.274
-Oh, yeah, one more thing.
-Yeah?

11:21.800 --> 11:24.439
Booty. Booty.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.431
Uncle Charlie?

11:38.320 --> 11:40.834
Uncle Charlie, are you awake?

11:41.280 --> 11:42.679
Go away.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.638
Don't you wanna be the first one
to wish me a happy birthday?

11:45.800 --> 11:48.712
-Jake, l swear to God--
-Wait, not yet.

11:48.880 --> 11:53.510
Five, four, three, two, one.
Okay, now.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.636
Get out.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.473
You can give me your present now
if you want to.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.713
lf you leave immediately,
l'll give you the gift of life.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.518
All right.

12:05.680 --> 12:09.912
-Hey, how come Dad's not in his room?
-He's out with Kandi.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.753
-When's he coming home?
-Not for a while.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.754
Why doesn't he just
have sex with her here?

12:17.080 --> 12:19.150
What makes you think
he's having sex with her?

12:19.320 --> 12:21.959
l don't know, common sense?

12:23.720 --> 12:27.918
All right. The thing is, he's embarrassed
about having that kind of relationship. . .

12:28.080 --> 12:29.991
. . .with somebody
so much younger than him.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.549
Why?

12:31.720 --> 12:35.110
l don't know, maybe he thinks
he's setting a bad example for you.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.511
What am l gonna do,
start dating a 6-year-old?

12:39.160 --> 12:42.232
-Go back to sleep.
-l can't. l'm too excited.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.391
Well, you mind if l go back to sleep?

12:44.560 --> 12:48.030
-Okay. l'll find something to do.
-Great.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.636
-Maybe l'll try to make a pizza.
-Good for you.

12:53.040 --> 12:54.359
Oh, crap.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.512
Pierre?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.113
Have you seen Pierre?

13:14.840 --> 13:17.559
-ls Pierre a cat?
-Yeah.

13:17.720 --> 13:21.349
-Bathroom.
-Thanks. Excuse me.

13:23.520 --> 13:27.399
-Hey.
-Hey. Oh, God.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.111
Still worth it.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.068
Hey, l'm watching that.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.468
Yeah, right.
Happy birthday, you big dope.

14:00.880 --> 14:04.316
-Why am l a big dope?
-When did you finally fall asleep?

14:04.480 --> 14:07.438
How could l possibly know that?

14:08.320 --> 14:11.471
Now you got a party in a couple hours
and you feel like hell, right?

14:11.640 --> 14:15.553
-Yeah.
-Happy birthday, you big dope.

14:16.040 --> 14:18.076
Hey, am l old enough
to have coffee now?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.398
Do you still think
armpit farts are funny?

14:21.560 --> 14:24.916
-Yeah.
-Then no.

14:25.080 --> 14:27.196
Come on,
l could really use a pick-me-up.

14:27.360 --> 14:31.114
-Okay, how do you want it?
-l don't know, in a cup?

14:36.080 --> 14:38.116
Good choice.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.670
-You feel better?
-Yeah, l think it's working.

14:53.640 --> 14:56.837
You know, Kandi, you don't
have to feel obligated to go to this party.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.958
lt's just gonna be a lot of kids
playing silly games.

15:00.120 --> 15:03.590
Are there gonna be balloon animals?
Because l love those.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.036
No, Jake's a little old for that.

15:07.200 --> 15:11.478
Balloon animals are
a very underappreciated art form, Alan.

15:13.160 --> 15:15.628
Just give me a minute to get ready.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.189
Okay.

15:18.240 --> 15:22.438
You know, it's probably gonna be
a very, very dull party.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.910
l wouldn't be going myself
if l weren't related to the kid.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.629
And without balloon animals,
you gotta ask yourself:

15:29.800 --> 15:31.631
''ls it really worth the trip?''

15:31.800 --> 15:33.438
How do l look?

15:37.080 --> 15:40.038
l'm-- l'm sorry,
l think l swallowed my tongue.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.595
Thank you.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.039
lt's amazing. My ex-wife
would take hours getting ready. . .

15:45.200 --> 15:47.794
. . .and the end result
wouldn't be nearly so. . .

15:48.560 --> 15:49.834
. . .this.

15:50.680 --> 15:53.717
Maybe l can give her a few tips
at the party.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.951
Oh, gee.

15:58.400 --> 16:02.871
-She doesn't respond well to tips.
-Okay. Anything else?

16:03.040 --> 16:04.917
Well. . .

16:05.080 --> 16:07.469
. . .even before l say it,
l know it sounds insane. . .

16:07.640 --> 16:10.279
. . .but do you think
you could put on a few more clothes?

16:11.680 --> 16:15.355
-Don't l look okay?
-Oh, yeah, yeah, you look terrific.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.797
lt's just, l wouldn't want people
to get the wrong idea.

16:18.960 --> 16:22.555
-About?
-About. . . .

16:24.320 --> 16:26.959
Maybe if you just put on a jacket
and a hat.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.797
Do you have a poncho?

16:29.960 --> 16:32.315
-Are you ashamed of me?
-No. No, l'm proud of you.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.277
ln fact, l'm so proud that yesterday. . .

16:34.440 --> 16:37.591
. . .l almost signed up to be
a Christian missionary in the Sudan.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.194
But you don't want
your family and friends to see me.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.873
Good, you understand.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.429
You know, Alan,
my friends are judgmental too.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.318
-About what?
-About you.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.277
None of them get why l'm with you.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.758
Well. . .

16:52.120 --> 16:56.875
. . .at the risk of shining a light
on something better left unexamined. . .

16:58.320 --> 16:59.469
. . .why are you with me?

16:59.640 --> 17:03.155
Because you're cute and smart
and really, really grateful.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.519
All true.

17:06.680 --> 17:10.434
And if my friends can't understand that,
well, then tough tomatoes.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.512
-Kandi, you're a remarkable girl.
-Thank you.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.310
Unfortunately, so am l.

17:20.280 --> 17:22.555
Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.551
You wanna have a quickie in the car?

17:25.440 --> 17:30.195
Well, all right.
But this time let's pull over first.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.709
Boring.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.912
So where's Alan? He's supposed to be
pitching in at this party.

17:38.080 --> 17:41.675
l don't know, but l'm guessing
that wherever he is, he's pitching.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.876
So l suppose Charlie hasn't told you.
l have a new man in my life.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.918
Oh, good for you, dear.
Does the man know yet?

17:50.200 --> 17:52.430
Hey, get your own, Red.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.429
Nice outfit.

17:59.200 --> 18:03.318
-Thanks. Rose picked it out for me.
-How about that?

18:09.400 --> 18:11.755
You know,
sometimes when we're having sex. . .

18:11.920 --> 18:13.273
. . .she calls out your name.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.115
No kidding?
What about the other times?

18:16.280 --> 18:18.350
She makes me call it out.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.473
Boy, that really wasn't a quickie,
was it?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.517
The first one was.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.592
Anyway, so just to reiterate,
today is Jake's day.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.557
-lt's not about us.
-l know.

18:32.720 --> 18:33.835
So you can just relax.

18:34.000 --> 18:38.278
And don't feel obligated to, you know,
socialize or talk to anybody.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.790
Don't worry, Alan.
l'm not gonna embarrass you.

18:40.960 --> 18:42.359
Right, l know you won't.

18:42.840 --> 18:46.833
So to summarize what l reiterated,
we're just gonna play it cool, low-key.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.560
Nothing to be gained
by drawing attention to ourselves.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.199
l got it.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.796
Just don't ring the doorbell.

19:03.880 --> 19:05.916
Sorry we're late. . .

19:07.520 --> 19:10.956
. . .but l was having sex
with this gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.870
Wait, wait, wait.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.074
Okay. Come in and say that again.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.669
Jake? You in here?
lt's time to do the birthday cake.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.273
Go away.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.590
-Did you find him?
-Yeah, he's in the bathroom.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.796
-ls he okay?
-l don't know.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.952
-Jake, are you okay?
-l'm fine. Go away.

19:34.120 --> 19:37.749
He's probably humiliated because
his father is dating a Camp Fire Girl.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.831
-Give it a rest, Judith.
-What's going on?

19:40.000 --> 19:42.673
-Jake won't come out of the bathroom.
-Come on out, honey.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.114
-l can't.
-Why not?

19:44.280 --> 19:45.759
l just can't.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.911
l was wondering
where everyone snuck off to.

19:48.080 --> 19:51.152
Whatever you're saying about me,
you can say right to my face.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.753
This isn't about you, Mom.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.992
-Wish l could believe that.
-What's the holdup?

19:56.160 --> 19:58.230
-He won't come out of the bathroom.
-He sick?

19:58.400 --> 20:00.277
-Who won't come out?
-Your grandson.

20:00.440 --> 20:01.793
Why? ls he mad at me?

20:02.880 --> 20:06.555
-Jake, what have you had to eat today?
-Just a little coffee and some vitamins.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.917
-Coffee? You let him have coffee?
-No. You let him have coffee?

20:10.080 --> 20:11.991
-He had a sip.
-Well, wait a second.

20:12.160 --> 20:14.720
-Why did you take vitamins?
-l was tired.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.314
Okay, but where did you find vitamins
to take?

20:17.480 --> 20:19.232
ln your medicine cabinet.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.630
l don't have any vitamins
in my medicine cabinet.

20:21.800 --> 20:24.837
Yeah, you do.
The little blue ones with a V on them.

20:28.880 --> 20:32.634
-What's going on? l don't understand.
-The kid's gonna need another party hat.
