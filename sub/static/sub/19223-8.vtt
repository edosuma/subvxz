00:01.669 --> 00:04.072
[upbeat music]

00:04.105 --> 00:06.374
- Aw, I loved Olympifury.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.409
[glass shatters, horn honks]

00:08.442 --> 00:12.180
- Green Fury is saving people
in a burning building!

00:12.213 --> 00:15.183
[dramatic music]

00:15.216 --> 00:18.186
*

00:18.219 --> 00:21.122
[whooshing]

00:22.856 --> 00:24.358
- Thanks.
- You'll be okay here.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.227
- Green Fury,
is that guy your new boyfriend?

00:26.260 --> 00:26.927
- Have you gained
a bunch of weight

00:26.960 --> 00:28.662
since The Olympian dumped you?

00:28.696 --> 00:30.164
- Did he dump you because
you didn't want children?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.100
- Or did he dump you
because you do?

00:32.133 --> 00:34.768
- Hey! This woman just saved
an entire building,

00:34.802 --> 00:37.605
and all you care about
is who she's dating?

00:37.638 --> 00:40.208
- Yes! Thank you!

00:40.241 --> 00:41.175
And I don't understand
why people

00:41.209 --> 00:42.443
keep calling me
Green Fury.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.178
I mean, I understand
the "Green" part,

00:44.212 --> 00:45.579
but I literally save people's
lives for a living!

00:45.613 --> 00:48.116
[Jack-O-Lantern laughing evilly]
- Watch out!

00:48.149 --> 00:50.118
[fireball whooshes]
[Emily grunts]

00:50.151 --> 00:51.619
- Green Fury!

00:51.652 --> 00:52.753
- You okay?

00:52.786 --> 00:55.123
- Yeah. Thanks.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.093
Hey! I owe you one.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.228
- Oh.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.095
- If you're ever in trouble,

01:01.129 --> 01:02.230
just push that button.

01:02.263 --> 01:05.733
- Thanks. I will.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.235
[whooshing]

01:07.268 --> 01:08.769
[chuckles softly]

01:08.802 --> 01:11.105
Oh, come on.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.142
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.376
You bitch.

01:15.409 --> 01:16.644
You knew I liked her.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.246
- Wh--
- How dare you?

01:18.279 --> 01:19.580
- No--
[scoffs]

01:19.613 --> 01:22.583
[heroic music]

01:22.616 --> 01:29.357
*

01:50.778 --> 01:53.447
- So you're telling me, if you
push that, Green Fury will come?

01:53.481 --> 01:55.483
- It's what she said.
- I'll give you $10,000 for it.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.318
- It's for emergencies, Teddy.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.920
And Green Fury just came off
dating The Olympian.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.689
I don't know if you're her type.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.325
both: Ooh!
- Okay. All right, all right.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.926
If it's the abs things,
I been working on mine.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.162
I watched this YouTube video
all about airbrush contouring

02:08.196 --> 02:09.663
for this area,
and it's pretty photo-real

02:09.697 --> 02:11.199
if I just, like,
constantly stand in front of her

02:11.232 --> 02:12.366
at the exact same angle.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.168
- We did a dry run.
I was mesmerized.

02:14.202 --> 02:16.204
- Uh-huh. Shredded!
[chuckles]

02:16.237 --> 02:18.172
- I'll kick in 500 bucks
if I can be there

02:18.206 --> 02:19.873
to watch her break his heart.

02:19.907 --> 02:22.176
- Aww, thank you, Wendy.
Okay, so we're at $10,500 now.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.844
Are you really gonna walk away
from that?

02:23.877 --> 02:25.313
So are you walking away
from that,

02:25.346 --> 02:27.681
or are you just...
walking away?

02:27.715 --> 02:29.183
- Ah, there she is!

02:29.217 --> 02:31.219
Who's ready
for her first board meeting?

02:31.252 --> 02:33.554
- This gal!
- [laughs]

02:33.587 --> 02:35.723
- I can't believe the board
even knows who I am.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.691
- They don't!
They said if I wanted to bring

02:37.725 --> 02:40.261
a lesser person
to make me feel important,

02:40.294 --> 02:41.529
that I could.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.197
- Well, they'll know
who I am soon.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.833
I've got some great ideas
on the Wayne Security Poncho.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.235
Do you want me to tell you now

02:47.268 --> 02:48.869
or surprise you
in front of the board?

02:48.902 --> 02:53.707
- Ooh, I so love surprises,
but...

02:53.741 --> 02:56.344
Listen, why don't we go
with door number three?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.712
Hmm? You don't talk at all.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.914
- Well, if I don't talk,
what do I do?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.316
- Quite a bit, actually.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.653
If I make a funny,
you make a laughy.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.321
- But, Van, this is my chance

03:07.355 --> 03:09.890
to meet the top executives
at the company.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.825
Okay, it is my moment
to shine!

03:11.859 --> 03:14.262
- And shine you will, Emily.
Shine you will.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.364
But dimly.
Very dimly.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.267
- Can you believe Van wants me
to sit silently

03:19.300 --> 03:21.235
in my first board meeting?

03:21.269 --> 03:22.870
- Actually, he's right.

03:22.903 --> 03:24.238
If you want to move ahead
in this company,

03:24.272 --> 03:26.240
you don't pitch them
your ideas.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.875
You tell the idiots
in that boys club

03:27.908 --> 03:29.943
how brilliant
their ideas are.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.546
- So you want me
to be a yes-man?

03:32.580 --> 03:33.881
- It works for Van.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.450
He is the Mozart
of sucking up.

03:36.484 --> 03:39.453
- Jackie, hey,
send Charles a cheese log

03:39.487 --> 03:42.356
as a congratulations
for his vasectomy.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.392
He'll get that
that's a penis joke, right?

03:44.425 --> 03:47.595
- I'll throw in some chestnuts
and a nutcracker.

03:47.628 --> 03:51.332
- [laughs]
Chestnuts?

03:52.600 --> 03:53.601
I don't get it.

03:53.634 --> 03:54.968
- He doesn't get it.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.970
- Mommy!

03:57.004 --> 03:59.039
- You better not
be having any fun.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.542
- Mom!

04:01.575 --> 04:05.045
I hate this place,
and I'm all out of tape.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.748
- Hey, next time you put tape
all over your face,

04:07.781 --> 04:09.283
start with your mouth.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.619
- Jackie!
You brought your daughter?

04:11.652 --> 04:13.654
I love kids.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.489
You can put anything
in their pockets,

04:15.523 --> 04:17.558
and no one ever checks.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.959
Hey, Ruby,
do you want to go shopping?

04:19.993 --> 04:21.394
- Yeah!
- She can't.

04:21.428 --> 04:23.464
She was suspended
from school

04:23.497 --> 04:25.599
because she hit
another kid.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.835
- Dope!

04:27.868 --> 04:31.071
So what'd the punk do
to deserve an ass-whupping?

04:31.104 --> 04:34.408
- Well, I don't know,
because Ruby refuses to tell me.

04:34.442 --> 04:37.645
- Hey, do you want to go hide
thumbtacks in Steve's sandwich?

04:37.678 --> 04:39.680
- Cool!
- No.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.515
Unfortunately,
she's too young to understand

04:41.549 --> 04:43.351
that you're a cautionary tale.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.319
You're sitting quietly by me.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.355
- Lame!
- Lame!

04:47.388 --> 04:48.489
[whispering]
I'm sorry.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.757
- You're lame!

04:49.790 --> 04:53.361
- Your mom is so lame.
- I know.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.329
- So we'll just toss that money
into the fake charity

04:55.363 --> 04:56.930
we made for tax purposes,

04:56.964 --> 04:59.433
unless anyone has
any moral objections.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.536
[laughter]

05:02.570 --> 05:04.372
- Don't laugh as loud as me.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.606
- I'm not.
- Okay, shh.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.541
- All right,
next item on the agenda

05:07.575 --> 05:10.344
is the Wayne Security Poncho.

05:10.378 --> 05:13.814
It is resistant to lasers,
gamma rays, fire,

05:13.847 --> 05:15.849
and, apparently, consumers.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.117
- Oh, no!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.118
- Our sales are as low

05:18.151 --> 05:19.720
as Charles' sperm count.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.390
- [laughs]
Kink in the hose!

05:22.423 --> 05:24.492
[laughter]
- So we are discontinuing it.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.895
- Oh, no! The head honcho
just killed the poncho.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.030
- Oh! Oh!

05:30.063 --> 05:31.465
- Uh, wait a minute.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.833
You can't just give up
on the poncho.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.668
It's a fantastic product.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.804
- Which no one is buying,
but you know who is?

05:36.837 --> 05:37.905
This guy!

05:37.938 --> 05:39.540
Come on.
First round is on me.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.409
- Uh, no.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.010
I would like to hear out
the young lady

05:43.043 --> 05:44.812
who just shut down
our entire meeting.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.848
- [laughs]

05:47.881 --> 05:50.384
- Well, the reason
it's not selling

05:50.418 --> 05:52.720
is because it doesn't have
a cool factor.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.588
What we really need
is a spokesperson

05:54.622 --> 05:57.157
that will make it cool
by association.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.092
- Like a Kevin James.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.661
- He is the King of Queens.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.997
- I was thinking
someone like a superhero.

06:04.031 --> 06:07.568
- Oh, my.
[laughter]

06:07.601 --> 06:09.470
- Superheroes
don't do commercials.

06:09.503 --> 06:13.541
- I can get Green Fury.
- Oh, my God.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.543
I think maybe you could order
green curry,

06:15.576 --> 06:18.946
but don't give any to me
because it makes me repeat.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.113
[laughter]

06:20.147 --> 06:21.615
[whooshing]

06:24.918 --> 06:26.454
- Did you butt-dial me,

06:26.487 --> 06:30.090
or do I need to ruin
someone's day?

06:30.123 --> 06:33.461
- Um, I'm sorry,
I-I didn't get your name.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.597
- Van Wayne.
- It's Emily. Emily Locke.

06:38.799 --> 06:41.134
- I gave you that button
for emergencies.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.135
- Well, and this is
an emergency,

06:42.169 --> 06:43.036
a work emergency,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.872
which some people would say
is actually--

06:44.905 --> 06:46.039
- I'm not hawking
your dumb poncho.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.108
I'm a superhero.
- Yeah. You are.

06:48.141 --> 06:50.744
But right now,
the world sees you

06:50.778 --> 06:52.212
like this.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.614
- Damn it!

06:53.647 --> 06:54.948
I was saving
that doughnut shop.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.817
I wasn't eating there.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.652
No one asks The Olympian
if he's packed on a few pounds,

06:58.686 --> 07:00.921
and I eat one lousy doughnut
and I'm on every cover.

07:00.954 --> 07:02.490
- Don't listen to them, Green.

07:02.523 --> 07:03.891
Your body's bangin'.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.727
- Who the hell's this dick?
- Well--

07:06.760 --> 07:08.929
- I'm Vanderveer Wayne,
and for the record,

07:08.962 --> 07:12.500
I think The Olympian was crazy
to dump yo' ass.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.502
- He didn't dump me.
I dumped him.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.504
No wonder the Justice League
doesn't take me seriously

07:16.537 --> 07:18.005
when this crap is all they see.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.608
- Well, what if we showed them
something else?

07:20.641 --> 07:21.909
We will build a campaign

07:21.942 --> 07:23.844
that will show the world
how strong, smart,

07:23.877 --> 07:25.679
and capable you are.

07:25.713 --> 07:28.081
The Justice League
will come crawling for you.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.483
- Yeah, and it doesn't matter

07:29.517 --> 07:30.951
how many guys dump you

07:30.984 --> 07:32.786
or how many doughnuts
you stuff in your face

07:32.820 --> 07:34.488
to drown your sorrows.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.656
- Van, I got this.
- All right.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.257
- Oh, what the hell?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.826
Things can't get any worse.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.494
I'll do it.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.662
But if you make me look stupid
in any way,

07:41.695 --> 07:43.664
remember that I shoot fire
out of my hands.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.533
- Don't worry.
We're gonna make you look great.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.935
We're the best and brightest.
- Hey, Green Fury!

07:47.968 --> 07:49.770
I can show you
where the secret bathroom is.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.204
- [gasps]
She's looking at me!

07:51.238 --> 07:52.205
She's looking at me!

07:52.239 --> 07:53.507
- No, she's looking at me!

07:53.541 --> 07:55.008
[Wendy giggles]
- Is she okay?

07:55.042 --> 07:56.143
- No.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.513
- You pressed the Green Fury
button without me?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.181
You know I have
an unhealthy obsession with her.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.150
- Green Fury is going to be
working with us, Teddy,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.786
so I'm gonna need you
to not act weird.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.888
Besides, she never gave you
the time of day.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.723
- Yeah, but I figured out why.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.659
- Oh, because of reality?
- No.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.127
It's because I wasn't rocking...

08:14.161 --> 08:15.596
this.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.230
- Oh.
- That looks uncomfortable.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.567
- I got it from an up-and-coming
Swedish designer named Yaast.

08:19.600 --> 08:22.803
- So you got a Yaast infection?
- [laughs]

08:22.836 --> 08:24.538
- [laughs mockingly]
Okay, you guys

08:24.572 --> 08:25.539
have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.840
I'm gonna go ask some people

08:26.874 --> 08:28.542
who are paid
to give their opinion.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.243
- Your jacket looks stupid.
- You're stupid.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.712
- Ladies, you all look
beautiful, first off.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.015
Thank you
for coming to our focus group.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.583
I would remind you,
you are allowed

08:36.616 --> 08:38.051
up to two slices of pizza,

08:38.085 --> 08:40.888
but I have been known
to lose count, okay?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.690
[laughter]

08:42.722 --> 08:44.625
Now, let's talk
Scarecrow's gas mask, all right?

08:44.658 --> 08:47.060
- Excuse me, Ron, can I borrow
these ladies for a second?

08:47.094 --> 08:48.696
- I mean, we are in the middle
of something right--

08:48.729 --> 08:49.830
- I'll keep it moving.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.699
What do you think
about this jacket?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.901
- Uh...not a fan.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.102
- What if I told you
this jacket

08:55.135 --> 08:56.870
is a Yaast?

08:56.904 --> 08:59.072
- Which way do I turn the dial
if I hate something?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.240
- Oh, to the left,
but I want to remind you

09:00.273 --> 09:01.609
he is not a part of this--

09:01.642 --> 09:02.676
- Looks like the kind of thing

09:02.710 --> 09:03.911
someone I don't like would wear.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.178
- I understand that,

09:05.212 --> 09:06.780
but perhaps we can focus
on this mask.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.682
- I feel like he gives off
a judgy type of vibe.

09:08.716 --> 09:10.250
- Oh, I do?
- Yeah.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.019
Like he thinks he's better
than everybody else.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.587
- Okay, you know what?
- I've felt that before.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.622
- This is not about me.

09:14.655 --> 09:17.090
This is about
a very cool jacket

09:17.124 --> 09:18.859
that your simple minds
can't comprehend, so...

09:18.892 --> 09:20.594
- Oh, okay.
[Teddy blows raspberry]

09:20.628 --> 09:22.630
Oh, um, ladies, I do want
to apologize for my friend,

09:22.663 --> 09:25.298
and I'm gonna go ahead
and remove that two-slice limit.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.700
It's a pizza party, y'all!

09:26.734 --> 09:29.069
- Whimsical zipper.
- It looks stupid.

09:29.102 --> 09:30.370
- You look stupid.

09:30.403 --> 09:31.872
- Did he just
call you stupid?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.240
- I mean what I say.
I mean what I say.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.307
Stupids.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.376
- Okay, um, Teddy?
- Yeah?

09:36.409 --> 09:39.747
- You are testing terribly
with women age 18 to 49.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.048
[indistinct shouting]

09:41.081 --> 09:42.616
- The dust from the rubble
clears

09:42.650 --> 09:45.786
as Green Fury surveys
the survivors.

09:45.819 --> 09:46.820
She says,

09:46.854 --> 09:48.656
"You don't need a cape
to be super.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.324
You just need
a Wayne Security Poncho."

09:51.358 --> 09:52.826
- Ooh.
- They put on the poncho

09:52.860 --> 09:54.795
and follow her
into a burning building,

09:54.828 --> 09:56.964
now completely protected.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.666
Explosion, explosion,
explosion,

09:58.699 --> 10:00.968
and...fade out.

10:01.001 --> 10:02.402
[quirky music]

10:02.435 --> 10:03.937
- That was...

10:03.971 --> 10:06.073
*

10:06.106 --> 10:07.975
Terr...
- Fantastic.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.242
- Fantastic.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.944
Fantastic!
[laughs]

10:10.978 --> 10:12.913
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.815
- Emily, this is impressive.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.850
You're gonna go very far
at this company...

10:16.884 --> 10:18.852
as long as you're not Facebook
friends with any of our wives.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.087
- [laughs]

10:20.120 --> 10:21.354
I don't have a wife,

10:21.388 --> 10:23.757
unless you count
marriages in Mexico.

10:23.791 --> 10:24.925
No comprende.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.294
- No.
 - No comprende.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.697
I fit in.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.799
[dramatic music]

10:31.832 --> 10:34.802
- Well, Superman,
you may be the Man of Steel...

10:34.835 --> 10:37.337
unless I steal your manhood!

10:37.370 --> 10:41.141
[saw whirring]
[both laughing maniacally]

10:41.174 --> 10:43.376
[saw powers down]

10:43.410 --> 10:46.146
both: Oh!

10:46.179 --> 10:49.316
- We were emasculating Superman!
- Yeah.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.684
- Go sit at my desk.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.720
- Fine.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.154
- Not you, dummy.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.155
Ruby.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.156
- Oh.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.157
Bye!

10:57.190 --> 10:59.326
- You're mean.

10:59.359 --> 11:02.129
- Oh, my gosh.
Ruby is so awesome.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.297
She gives the best advice, like,

11:04.331 --> 11:06.233
"Sometimes
a cloud makes you happy.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.201
Sometimes
a cloud makes you sad."

11:08.235 --> 11:10.403
It's like, how does she know?

11:10.437 --> 11:12.239
- I'm gonna shut down
this friendship

11:12.272 --> 11:15.475
before Ruby also starts dressing
like a sexually active grandma.

11:15.508 --> 11:19.713
- Oh! Thank you.
- She's not here to play.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.882
She's being punished
for punching another kid.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.416
- Oh, Miles totally
had it coming.

11:23.450 --> 11:24.885
She had a good reason.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.387
- Wait, she told you
why she punched him?

11:27.420 --> 11:29.723
- Yeah...
but I can't say anything.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.491
She made me pinkie swear.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.261
- Tell me.
- I'm sorry, Jackie.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.997
We pinkie sweared.

11:37.030 --> 11:40.000
[whispering]
We pinkie sweared.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.769
*

11:41.802 --> 11:44.204
- Emily, hi, you're a single
heterosexual female

11:44.237 --> 11:46.339
between the ages
of 24 and 35, right?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.941
Or is this Green Fury thing
more than just

11:47.975 --> 11:49.109
a little experimentation?

11:49.142 --> 11:50.778
- We're just friends.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.079
- Okay, well,
congratulations.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.181
You've been selected
to take a short survey.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.750
- "How sexually desirable
do you find Teddy

11:56.784 --> 11:58.786
on a scale from one to ten?"

11:58.819 --> 12:00.220
Teddy,
I don't have time for this.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.889
I am on a rocket ship
to the top of this company.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.423
- Okay, so, like, 8 1/2?

12:03.456 --> 12:05.125
Let's call it a nine.
Keep the math easy.

12:05.158 --> 12:07.027
Look, Ron,
you saw how I tested with women.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.295
How am I gonna win over
Green Fury

12:08.328 --> 12:09.897
if I can't charm a focus group?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.398
- I'm not sure
you should put so much stock

12:11.431 --> 12:12.966
in a group of people
we found at a mall

12:13.000 --> 12:14.835
eating Sbarro's at 10:00 a.m.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.436
I mean, who eats
a breakfast calzone?

12:16.469 --> 12:17.938
- [chuckles]

12:17.971 --> 12:19.439
- Plus, I mean,
I think you're great.

12:19.472 --> 12:20.808
- Yeah,
but I've always tested well

12:20.841 --> 12:22.810
with black males
ages 25 to 44.

12:22.843 --> 12:26.113
- You're talking about me
and Dan in accounting.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.180
- Yeah.

12:29.149 --> 12:32.119
- Looking good, Dan!
- Great.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.087
- I mean, we really should hire
more black people.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.790
- I can't believe
 we're actually here.

12:36.824 --> 12:38.959
- Oh, is that jerky?
That's jerky.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.560
- It's the big day, Emily!

12:40.593 --> 12:41.995
Are you ready
to paint your "Mona Lisa"?

12:42.029 --> 12:43.263
- Yeah!
[laughs]

12:43.296 --> 12:45.799
I am so exci...ted.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.968
What is that car for?
- Ooh.

12:48.001 --> 12:48.936
Did they not show you
the latest?

12:48.969 --> 12:50.437
- Mm-mm.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.972
- It's basically--
it's your idea.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.340
Green Fury
is fighting villains.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.942
It's just now some
of her clothes get burnt off

12:54.975 --> 12:56.977
because, you know, the fire.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.511
So she's a little naked.

12:58.545 --> 13:01.248
- Wait, what?
- You don't expect that, right?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.482
- No.
- And now

13:02.515 --> 13:04.251
her car's dirty
from the battle.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.354
She's got to get it clean,
so it's sexy, sudsy.

13:07.387 --> 13:09.489
- Where is the poncho?
- At the end.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.825
Green Fury rises heroically
out of the hot tub,

13:11.859 --> 13:13.360
she's wearing nothing
but bubbles and a smile,

13:13.393 --> 13:16.196
and she says,
"I feel naked

13:16.229 --> 13:18.932
without my
Wayne Security Poncho."

13:18.966 --> 13:19.967
- Huh!

13:20.000 --> 13:21.501
- It's kind of a thinker,

13:21.534 --> 13:23.336
but let's not underestimate
the audience.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.972
- Emily,
I need to use your purse

13:25.005 --> 13:26.273
to store this jerky.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.508
- Look, this isn't the campaign
I came up with.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.877
- Look at her, being so modest.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.911
Emily, this is all you.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.479
Marketing just made some tweaks.

13:32.512 --> 13:34.281
- It needed tweaks.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.616
You know, I've been telling her
that since day one. Jerky?

13:36.649 --> 13:38.919
- I would.
It's just the aspirin.

13:38.952 --> 13:40.854
Anyway, Emily, congratulations.
[cell phone rings]

13:40.888 --> 13:43.323
You're really making a name
for yourself with the board.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.994
Oh, my God, Green Fury
is going to be so pissed.

13:47.027 --> 13:48.862
This is the opposite
of everything--

13:48.896 --> 13:51.865
Just take the jerky purse!

13:51.899 --> 13:54.034
She's never gonna do this.
It's offensive!

13:54.067 --> 13:55.368
- It's like
the old saying goes:

13:55.402 --> 13:57.037
"If you want to make
an omelet,

13:57.070 --> 13:59.006
you have to compromise
all of your principles."

13:59.039 --> 14:01.308
- This isn't how I wanted
to succeed.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.011
- Well, then it will be
how you fail.

14:04.044 --> 14:06.880
Yes. Because it was your idea,
everyone will blame you.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.481
- Okay, Emily.
I'm here.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.917
What are we doing?

14:09.950 --> 14:11.584
- That is an excellent
question.

14:11.618 --> 14:15.255
Emily, what are we doing?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.289
- [sighs]

14:18.992 --> 14:21.494
- I'm so done
with "Game of Thrones."

14:21.528 --> 14:23.030
I mean, the nudity
is just gratuitous.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.998
It's not even, like,
sensual composition.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.233
I mean, the fact
that it's the same network

14:26.266 --> 14:27.567
that gave Lena Dunham
a platform

14:27.600 --> 14:30.070
is just confounding to me,
you know?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.604
All bodies are good bodies.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.540
- Yeah.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.042
- What are you talking about?

14:35.075 --> 14:36.910
You love "Game of Thrones."

14:36.944 --> 14:38.678
I mean, you uploaded a super cut
of all the nudity

14:38.711 --> 14:40.447
and called it
a "thigh-light reel"...

14:40.480 --> 14:42.249
which was very clever.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.917
- I crunched the numbers
from the surveys,

14:43.951 --> 14:46.086
and I found the perfect persona
to ask out Green Fury.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.221
I am now a tough but sensitive
woke feminist

14:48.255 --> 14:49.957
who was raised
by a single parent

14:49.990 --> 14:52.559
after his mother was killed
trying to save Christmas.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.094
- Okay, well, buddy,
I was with you

14:54.127 --> 14:56.063
the last time you tried
to pick up Green Fury,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.697
and I don't think
it's in the cards.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.132
- Emily!

14:59.166 --> 15:00.934
Where's Emily?

15:00.968 --> 15:01.768
- Showtime.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.271
Right after I apply
some guy-liner.

15:04.304 --> 15:07.007
- Oh, you done lost
yo' damn mind.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.575
- Oh, and don't forget,

15:08.608 --> 15:09.977
Ruby's allergic to cats.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.945
Also, her bedtime is 8:30,

15:11.979 --> 15:13.213
although that's really
up to you now,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.948
and here is her
birth certificate.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.017
By the way,
the father is not unknown.

15:17.050 --> 15:18.485
I was just pissed at him
that day.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.088
- Um, what are you doing?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.956
I thought that you wanted
to be Ruby's mother now

15:22.990 --> 15:24.657
because she tells you
all her secrets

15:24.691 --> 15:26.326
and she wants
nothing to do with me.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.961
- I can't take your kid!

15:27.995 --> 15:30.063
My apartment is not zoned
for human habitation.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.133
- Why did she tell you
why she hit that kid?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.667
I gave her life.

15:34.701 --> 15:37.404
You make ramen with hot water
from the bathroom faucet.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.108
- Jackie, she has her reasons.
You just have to trust me.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.111
- I don't. You're a barely
functioning human being

15:44.144 --> 15:47.180
who has the same backpack
as a seven-year-old.

15:47.214 --> 15:50.617
Ruby is literally the only thing
that I care about,

15:50.650 --> 15:52.752
and I want to make sure
she doesn't end up like you.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.587
- Stop!

15:54.621 --> 15:56.123
I hit Miles

15:56.156 --> 15:57.991
because he called you
a garbage lady

15:58.025 --> 15:59.459
who can't keep a husband.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.594
I didn't tell you
because I thought

16:01.628 --> 16:03.430
it would hurt your feelings.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.433
[soft music]

16:06.466 --> 16:11.038
*

16:11.071 --> 16:12.539
- That's okay.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.541
You can always
tell me anything.

16:14.574 --> 16:17.310
- Um, except
when you pinkie swear!

16:17.344 --> 16:19.646
What the hell, Ruby?

16:19.679 --> 16:21.348
Best friends forever!

16:21.381 --> 16:23.483
I gave her a locket!

16:23.516 --> 16:26.053
- And if you think about it,
you're not really naked.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.287
You're just saying
you feel naked

16:27.320 --> 16:29.289
without your
Wayne Security Poncho.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.558
- So I'm not actually naked?
- No, you're definitely naked.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.461
But it's a great example
of sex-positive feminism.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.163
- Hey, Emily,
the patriarchy called.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.664
They want their rationale back.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.199
[chuckles]
Green?

16:39.232 --> 16:40.733
No one told me
you'd be here.

16:40.767 --> 16:41.734
It's me, Theo.

16:41.768 --> 16:42.735
Remember? Theo?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.171
- What happened to you?

16:44.204 --> 16:47.174
- I'm woke now,
yeah, so, um,

16:47.207 --> 16:49.042
what about we go
after this is done

16:49.076 --> 16:50.643
and we get some
green smoothies,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.180
um, but, like, what do you think
about that, like...

16:53.213 --> 16:56.149
- Um, I think
that this is a lot.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.085
- All right, buddy.
Come on.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.220
I'm gonna get that smoothie
with you.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.155
Right after we hose off
that guy-liner.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.192
- Coexist.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:05.224 --> 17:07.060
- Look, Emily.
I trust you.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.328
If you really think

17:08.361 --> 17:10.063
that I should do
this commercial,

17:10.097 --> 17:12.332
I'll do it.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.767
- No. Because it's terrible.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.836
- I'm glad you think so,
because I was not gonna do it.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.107
- Oh.
Okay, so we're agreed.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.407
I don't care what this does
to my career,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.242
but I am pulling the plug
on this thing.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.676
- Wait. Just a second.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.779
I like that fire,
but if I quit now,

17:26.813 --> 17:28.115
then the headlines will read,

17:28.147 --> 17:30.083
"Bitter green diva
walks off set."

17:30.117 --> 17:31.418
- Well, at least it won't be

17:31.451 --> 17:33.553
about The Olympian
breaking your heart.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.288
- Not sure that he would mind.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.557
Pretty sure it's him leaking
all that garbage to the press.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.692
All that guy cares about
is being famous.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.361
- Really?

17:41.394 --> 17:43.230
What do you think
he's doing right now?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.232
- Hey. Real quick.

17:45.265 --> 17:48.535
Did I mention that my mom died
saving Christmas?

17:48.568 --> 17:51.338
Okay. I'll see you later.
- Bye, Theo.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.544
- Then after you're done
washing the car,

17:57.577 --> 17:59.246
you get into the hot tub--
- Hang on. Hang on.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.481
So you're saying I'm naked
the whole time?

18:01.514 --> 18:04.251
- Well, it depends
on what you mean by--

18:04.284 --> 18:05.585
- Naked the whole time.
Everybody sees everything.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.721
Ass. Pecs.
The whole enchilada.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.491
- I'm in.
- Boom! He's in! Grease him up.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.593
Including the enchilada.
- Emily.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.262
I just heard about this thing
with The Olympian.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.330
- So did I, and I think it is--

18:17.364 --> 18:20.833
- Yeah, I think--
- It is a very sh...

18:20.867 --> 18:22.769
- It's great!
- Great!

18:22.802 --> 18:24.171
Great.
- Yeah.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.638
You're really going places,
Emily.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.441
- Yes, we are.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.211
- Hey, Green.
You got dinner plans later?

18:31.244 --> 18:32.679
- With you? No.

18:32.712 --> 18:34.614
But call me around 11:00.
We'll knock one out.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.316
- All right.

18:36.349 --> 18:39.319
[sultry music]

18:39.352 --> 18:46.125
*

18:46.359 --> 18:48.361
- You look a little cold.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.501
The Wayne Security Poncho.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.303
It's hot.

18:56.336 --> 19:01.374
*

19:01.408 --> 19:03.343
- Don't get caught naked
 without one.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.178
- Wayne Security Poncho
 does not protect

19:05.212 --> 19:06.713
against magic or rain.

19:06.746 --> 19:09.449
- So what do you ladies think?
- Love it.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.883
- Definitely makes me
want to buy one.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.619
- I still don't like
that guy next to you.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.187
- Okay, it's not about me.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.555
- Okay, well,
you guys are free to go now.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.357
Don't forget
your Burrito Gigante coupon

19:17.390 --> 19:20.227
for $10 off any purchase
of $150 or more.

19:20.260 --> 19:23.396
[both laugh]

19:23.430 --> 19:25.332
- I should've listened to you.

19:25.365 --> 19:26.666
I mean, I know have a reputation
of being a bit of a Lothario.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.368
- No, no one says that.
- Debatable.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.670
But the truth is,
I'm kind of in a slump.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.372
- Well, buddy,
you're never gonna get out of it

19:32.405 --> 19:34.407
by becoming some type
of Frankenstein monster

19:34.441 --> 19:36.276
of testing results.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.277
- You're right.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.478
You know, I just gotta be me.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.646
- Mm.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.813
- Cool jacket.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.349
Is that Yaast?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.651
- Why, Yaast, it is.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.486
- [laughs]
- It's still stupid.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.487
- Okay, you're stupider.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.389
Not you.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.857
She's the stupid one.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.764
- Having some bathroom ramen?
- Maybe.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.868
- [sighs]

20:01.901 --> 20:03.436
I'm sorry that I said
that you were

20:03.470 --> 20:06.239
a barely functioning
human being.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.277
Just gonna keep on slurping.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.350
I'm the only one
looking out for Ruby,

20:17.384 --> 20:19.586
and I never know
if I'm doing a good job.

20:19.619 --> 20:21.888
- Well, you are.
Ruby's really awesome.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.556
- Thanks.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.358
And it wouldn't be
the worst thing in the world

20:25.392 --> 20:27.694
if she ended up like you.
- Oh.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.963
- It would be
really, really bad

20:30.997 --> 20:32.799
but not the worst.

20:34.301 --> 20:35.635
- Thank you?

20:35.668 --> 20:37.904
- Hey! Check it out.

20:37.937 --> 20:40.340
The Olympian's sharing
his bedroom secrets.

20:40.373 --> 20:41.608
- What,
that he couldn't get it up

20:41.641 --> 20:43.343
unless I wore his helmet
and called him Dark Side?

20:43.376 --> 20:44.877
- That is disturbing.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.713
- Well, on the upside,
they covered the bank robbery

20:46.746 --> 20:48.315
I thwarted yesterday.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.449
- See, the campaign worked.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.983
Everybody's taking you
seriously.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.052
- Yeah, I got a call
from the Justice League.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.621
Europe, but still.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.389
- Definitely one of the top five
Justice Leagues.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.657
- It's not.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.758
- Well, it looks like

20:58.791 --> 21:00.360
we all got what we wanted.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.728
And the best part about it is,

21:01.761 --> 21:05.465
we didn't have to compromise
who we are as women.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.067
You know, if there's one thing
I've learned, th--

21:08.100 --> 21:09.336
[whooshing]

21:09.369 --> 21:11.604
Hey!
Hey!

21:11.638 --> 21:15.475
No, wait, I'm trying
to explain feminism!

21:15.508 --> 21:17.444
When a man is talking,
you listen--

21:17.477 --> 21:19.479
God, she's coming back!

21:19.512 --> 21:20.347
Whoa!

21:20.380 --> 21:21.781
- Ha. That's funny.
