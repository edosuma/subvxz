<b>The Legend Of Ben Hall</b>

02:41.506 --> 02:42.538
So, where we goin' now?

02:43.824 --> 02:44.428
Back to the locker.

02:46.877 --> 02:48.333
What do you expect
to find up there?

02:48.453 --> 02:49.356
I'll tell you what

02:49.964 --> 02:51.829
A lot of bloody nothin'
and you know it!

02:52.040 --> 02:54.650
Should be goin' down south
crossin' into Victoria like Jack did

02:54.770 --> 02:56.528
I'm not going south, Jim
and that's the end of it!

03:27.791 --> 03:28.085
Jim...

03:31.173 --> 03:32.365
Jim, get up,
it's your watch.

03:33.520 --> 03:34.217
It's your watch

04:37.563 --> 04:39.375
Where are you,
you bastards?

04:46.481 --> 04:47.513
Ben Hall!

04:48.678 --> 04:50.058
Come out and
surrender yourself!

04:50.619 --> 04:51.873
Remember the Queen!

04:53.445 --> 04:54.249
Halt!

04:54.638 --> 04:57.152
We know you're out there,
we got you bloody surrounded!

05:29.627 --> 05:30.106
Shot!

05:53.054 --> 05:54.209
After him, boys!

06:24.493 --> 06:27.892
I've shot the bastard!
I've shot Ben Hall!

06:40.585 --> 06:41.637
There he is!

06:42.231 --> 06:43.029
Come on!

07:35.838 --> 07:36.214
Will!

07:37.228 --> 07:39.106
Will, over here!

07:43.293 --> 07:44.640
Ah, Jesus Christ!

07:45.252 --> 07:46.955
You got a pellet in you?
You alright?

07:48.392 --> 07:50.150
The bullet went straight through.
Right.

07:50.520 --> 07:53.273
Damn, lookie there!
Bad shots, right?

07:54.731 --> 07:57.002
How the hell did those traps get
so close without us knowing?

08:26.353 --> 08:27.630
Hands in the air, Mr. Gibson.

08:31.077 --> 08:31.828
Benjamin?

08:32.664 --> 08:34.400
It's good to see you again
after all these years.

08:35.818 --> 08:37.481
You look well.
Hey,

08:37.953 --> 08:41.089
I need horses and food.
and clean rags, now!

08:41.399 --> 08:42.760
I hope you
forgive our intrusion,

08:43.455 --> 08:45.418
under normal circumstances,
I would leave you, Bill, alone.

08:47.032 --> 08:48.224
This is a matter of
life and death.

08:50.553 --> 08:51.933
What are you doing
back out this way?

08:52.421 --> 08:54.628
Thought you boys were
ranging around Carcoar.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.876
Carcoar was getting
too hot for us.

08:57.517 --> 08:59.996
Then, you are back here for good?
No.

09:01.546 --> 09:02.982
I'm just lookin' for someone.
Who?

09:04.710 --> 09:05.301
Just someone.

09:06.900 --> 09:07.698
I might be able to help.

09:12.694 --> 09:13.501
I'm lookin' for Biddy.

09:15.942 --> 09:16.975
You don't know
where she is?

09:18.168 --> 09:18.553
No.

09:20.233 --> 09:21.726
After she left, I
never found her again.

09:23.501 --> 09:24.525
What do you
want with her now?

09:32.961 --> 09:34.031
You know where she is.

09:36.135 --> 09:38.090
Where is she?
Will I regret telling you?

09:38.210 --> 09:39.640
You'll regret it
more if you don't.

09:44.670 --> 09:46.830
She's on Marsdon Station
out of Micalb.

09:47.290 --> 09:48.455
Your boy's there too.

09:49.140 --> 09:50.445
So, a little word...

09:54.612 --> 09:56.105
She's still with Jim Taylor.

10:00.847 --> 10:01.814
What are you gonna do?

10:03.469 --> 10:04.568
That's not your concern.

10:07.544 --> 10:08.464
Thanks for the horses, Bill.

10:18.943 --> 10:20.689
I'm done, lad, I'm leavin'.

10:21.091 --> 10:22.906
What do you mean, Jim?
What I mean is...

10:23.026 --> 10:24.652
I'm headin' to Victoria
as fast as I can.

10:25.347 --> 10:27.309
To hell with bushrangin',
It doesn't mean a damn!

10:27.506 --> 10:28.304
There's no money in it

10:28.424 --> 10:29.766
and I'm gettin' out
while I can and

10:29.850 --> 10:32.539
live what life I got left in free
but not in fuckin' chains.

10:33.478 --> 10:34.858
Alone is when
they catch you.

10:34.978 --> 10:37.957
Then why don't you come to Victoria with me?
I'm not going to bloody Victoria!

10:38.739 --> 10:40.091
Aah, suit yourself.

10:40.533 --> 10:44.111
Chase that woman? You might put
this shite behind you and move on, huh?

10:46.325 --> 10:47.925
We're through, old man.

10:48.861 --> 10:49.547
Oh, yeah?

10:50.204 --> 10:50.936
We are.

10:51.631 --> 10:53.378
See, this is your problem, boyo.

10:53.856 --> 10:55.791
Women, they always
get the better of you,

10:56.821 --> 11:00.689
especially that screwer
you keep pining about.

11:01.403 --> 11:02.520
Fuckin' bastard!

11:07.552 --> 11:09.251
You'll never even
make the Murray, you old fool,

11:09.495 --> 11:10.340
let alone cross it!

12:12.121 --> 12:12.919
Henry!

12:13.263 --> 12:15.235
Get inside right now!
Go!

12:40.316 --> 12:43.162
You're not welcome here, Benjamin!
You hear me?

12:44.011 --> 12:44.818
Get out of here!

12:45.851 --> 12:46.743
Where's Taylor

12:47.701 --> 12:48.941
Not here, now go!

12:50.725 --> 12:52.058
I've come to see my son.

12:52.340 --> 12:54.264
He doesn't remember
who you are, Benjamin.

12:55.195 --> 12:56.191
Call him out here.

13:01.946 --> 13:03.036
I won't ask you again.

13:05.102 --> 13:05.853
Call him out.

13:08.905 --> 13:09.853
Henry!

13:11.412 --> 13:12.905
Come out here, please.

13:17.875 --> 13:18.871
It's alright!

13:33.406 --> 13:34.035
Henry...

13:35.284 --> 13:36.129
Do you remember me?

13:41.191 --> 13:42.243
I'm your father, Henry!

13:43.783 --> 13:45.022
Your Dah, remember?

13:46.505 --> 13:47.078
It's true.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.341
I've been looking
for you for a long time.

13:51.303 --> 13:52.260
Because, your mum,

13:53.303 --> 13:54.598
she took you away from me.

13:56.861 --> 13:58.561
Henry, I need you
to do something...

13:59.953 --> 14:00.939
quick as you can,

14:01.690 --> 14:03.850
get your clothes and
everything that belongs to you.

14:04.873 --> 14:06.648
because you're coming with me now.
What?

14:06.768 --> 14:08.451
Go on.
What are you talking about?

14:08.571 --> 14:09.426
Benjamin?

14:10.496 --> 14:11.820
You are not
taking him anywhere!

14:11.849 --> 14:12.910
He's my son!

14:13.187 --> 14:15.205
You had no right to take him
from me and I will not have

14:15.325 --> 14:16.830
Taylor raising him,
not for another minute!

14:17.110 --> 14:20.152
No! I won't let you
take him, you bastard!

14:21.587 --> 14:22.817
Do you hear me?

14:23.023 --> 14:26.338
No, I won't let you take him!
He's coming with me...

14:26.458 --> 14:29.164
or I'll wait here for Taylor to
get back and when he does,

14:29.284 --> 14:31.286
I swear I'll do what I should
have done a long time ago.

14:31.719 --> 14:33.071
I was right to leave you!

14:34.602 --> 14:35.888
Look what you've become!

14:42.290 --> 14:43.717
So, what's it gonna be?

14:44.938 --> 14:47.417
Well, what choice do I have?
None.

14:48.957 --> 14:49.886
See how you like it.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.552
Where are you taking him?

15:07.050 --> 15:09.088
Jesus, Ben!
Can I come in?

15:09.208 --> 15:10.262
Yeah, of course. Quickly!

15:15.180 --> 15:17.687
I won't have that bastard, Taylor,
bringing up my son.

15:18.495 --> 15:20.608
He's a drunkard and a
scoundrel, you know that.

15:20.728 --> 15:21.415
I know that.

15:21.932 --> 15:23.960
It doesn't seem right,
snatching him away like that.

15:24.817 --> 15:26.207
No worse than what
she did to me.

15:26.327 --> 15:29.531
Ben, the police will come
after us if he stays here.

15:30.038 --> 15:30.865
I'm his father,

15:32.057 --> 15:34.761
I decide who he lives with
and not the bloody police.

15:34.881 --> 15:36.489
Henry doesn't know
his Benjamin

15:36.609 --> 15:39.616
He'll want to see his mother.
She'll come looking for him, too.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.038
No!

15:40.705 --> 15:42.395
She's no more fit to
raise him than Taylor is.

15:42.660 --> 15:44.782
But she's still his mother.
She doesn't deserve to be!

15:47.129 --> 15:52.065
Bill, I can't raise him
but you can

15:54.121 --> 15:54.825
Please, Bill.

15:56.709 --> 15:58.230
I'll ask nothing else
of you, ever again.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.915
I can't stay, Henry.
I'm sorry.

16:07.431 --> 16:09.065
but Uncle Bill and Auntie Anne
are your family,

16:10.098 --> 16:11.187
they're going to take good care of you.

16:11.441 --> 16:12.802
When can I go home?

16:15.056 --> 16:15.901
This is your home now.

16:17.366 --> 16:18.699
I'll come to see you
as often as I can.

17:17.376 --> 17:19.470
You expecting anyone?
No.

17:29.823 --> 17:30.527
Who's there?

17:31.597 --> 17:32.302
Hello, Mitch.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.541
Ben? Is that you?

17:37.169 --> 17:38.493
Ha, ha, ha,ha, ha!

17:39.104 --> 17:41.338
You're the last person I ever
expected to see tonight!

17:44.080 --> 17:45.254
Look who it is, Mary.

17:46.244 --> 17:47.634
Benjamin!

17:48.940 --> 17:52.123
So wonderful to see you.
My God, it's been so long!

17:52.243 --> 17:55.043
Not intruding, am I?
Not at all, you're always welcome!

17:55.762 --> 17:58.776
Looking rather frightful, these days.
I am sorry about that.

17:59.002 --> 18:00.636
Let's just get the man
something to eat, love,

18:06.384 --> 18:10.281
Is this Catherine?
You're all grown up!

18:10.562 --> 18:13.614
Catherine, this is an old friend
of your Ma and Da's, Mr. Hall.

18:14.112 --> 18:15.248
Hi, Mr. Hall.

18:29.354 --> 18:29.927
Da!

18:38.244 --> 18:38.967
Ben!

19:07.111 --> 19:08.491
You stay right here.

19:27.239 --> 19:30.751
Good morning, gentlemen!
Can I offer your men some water?

19:30.871 --> 19:34.591
No, thank you, Madam, we've just come
from the Stricklands, they took care of us.

19:35.465 --> 19:38.535
Well, then, Colonel, I'll leave you to it.
If you do see anything, make sure to...

20:05.615 --> 20:06.967
They were just happening by.

20:07.221 --> 20:09.268
They do that from time to time,
asking questions.

20:09.540 --> 20:11.982
And what did you tell them, Mick?
Same as I always do:

20:12.874 --> 20:15.597
that I haven't seen you,
not for years.

20:19.277 --> 20:21.446
Do you know who's that Inspector?
Ernst Sanderson.

20:21.737 --> 20:22.780
He's not such a bad sort.

20:23.878 --> 20:27.230
I keep things friendly with him.
It's easier for us that way.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.526
They know you're in the area, Ben

20:31.521 --> 20:32.949
It's not safe for you here.

20:34.235 --> 20:35.089
For any of us.

21:33.587 --> 21:34.301
Jack!

21:37.559 --> 21:39.897
What the hell are you doing here?
Looking for you, of course!

21:40.389 --> 21:42.258
Knew I'd find you here
with Goobang Mick.

21:42.539 --> 21:46.107
Does his missus still fancy you?
Keep your voice down!

21:46.999 --> 21:47.572
What happened?

21:47.910 --> 21:49.469
Thought you'd be halfway
back to Canada by now.

21:49.507 --> 21:50.540
No, forget that...

21:50.765 --> 21:52.127
went home to Victoria
for a while.

21:52.540 --> 21:54.615
But I'm ready to come out again.
Had to...

21:55.028 --> 21:57.883
Blew all my cash on cheap grogan
and cheaper tarts

21:59.834 --> 22:01.186
It was glorious!

22:01.919 --> 22:03.374
Heard they caught the old man
down on the river.

22:05.308 --> 22:06.069
I did warn him.

22:06.313 --> 22:08.407
Ah,the man was a
pain in the ass, anyway.

22:10.504 --> 22:11.715
Christ, you look terrible!

22:12.204 --> 22:13.114
You know that.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.072
Compared to you, I always did.
This is true!

22:18.504 --> 22:19.903
One cannot buy style, they said.

22:21.402 --> 22:23.609
I'll tell ya, I'm just itching
to get back out there.

22:24.398 --> 22:25.844
You know, one paper claimed I was dead

22:26.041 --> 22:27.600
and that you were the bloke who shot me.

22:29.226 --> 22:31.884
Now, I want them to
know that I'm alive

22:32.888 --> 22:34.456
and... back on the job.

22:35.114 --> 22:35.978
I think we should give it up.

22:37.144 --> 22:39.012
Give it up?
Come on, Ben!

22:39.388 --> 22:40.750
2 years, we rode together.

22:41.172 --> 22:42.806
2 years and they couldn't touch us.

22:43.059 --> 22:44.130
Place is getting hotter, Jack.

22:44.936 --> 22:45.537
More than ever.

22:45.818 --> 22:46.626
It's alright, Gilbert,

22:46.746 --> 22:49.508
Sir Fred's got the Lochland by the
.balls and he's sqeezing tight.

22:49.628 --> 22:52.842
Alright, so let's head south,
Auburn way.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.479
keep clear out of the Lochland

22:54.770 --> 22:56.395
We'd need to skip the country, Jack.
What?

22:56.808 --> 22:57.456
And go where?

23:01.273 --> 23:01.893
America.

23:03.668 --> 23:05.743
Why the hell do you
want to go to America?

23:06.146 --> 23:07.067
It's not part of the Empire.

23:07.104 --> 23:08.963
They're fighting a bloody
Civil War over there.

23:08.982 --> 23:11.283
And war is the perfect time
to slip in without a fuss!

23:12.138 --> 23:15.238
To get passage, will cost us a small
fortune, Ben. You do know that?

23:16.914 --> 23:18.181
So we need to
go ahead and get it.

23:21.552 --> 23:23.205
Like I said:
we head south.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.637
Hit the mailrooms,
we just bale them up!

23:25.946 --> 23:27.411
One after the other,
bang, bang, bang!

23:28.003 --> 23:30.088
Right, just the pair of us.

23:30.341 --> 23:31.468
We'll find some more lads.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.853
Cold, sly, kids with some real moxie.

23:34.473 --> 23:35.675
Come on, Ben!

23:36.879 --> 23:39.001
It's no fun playing
without you in the game.

23:44.449 --> 23:48.055
We ride again, we do so
for one purpose:

23:48.674 --> 23:51.651
to get out, to skip the country
for good. Are we clear?

23:52.320 --> 23:53.315
Now, I'm up for that.

23:56.038 --> 23:57.925
MM, Goobang, how's the wife?

24:05.513 --> 24:07.738
There's some bread, bacon
and potatoes.

24:08.364 --> 24:09.059
You're a sweetheart.

24:10.739 --> 24:13.293
Thanks for everything, Mick.
You're always welcome.

24:15.622 --> 24:18.918
Maam, always a pleasure.
So long, godday!

24:54.419 --> 24:55.452
Just me, then.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.921
I have company!
You remember Mr. Kelly?

25:00.438 --> 25:02.588
Of course, you're lookin'
better than ever, young Benjamin.

25:02.888 --> 25:03.903
Mr. Kelly.
Miss!

25:04.437 --> 25:06.728
It's John-John, the jockey
I was telling you about.

25:06.848 --> 25:07.967
My grandson.

25:09.920 --> 25:11.695
Very pleased to
finally meet you, Mr. Hall.

25:13.390 --> 25:13.916
Join us.

25:14.798 --> 25:16.075
Johnny here
did a bloody good job

25:16.113 --> 25:18.085
telegraphing for me in
Omelia, a few years back.

25:19.287 --> 25:22.028
How ols are you?
Almost eighteen.

25:23.466 --> 25:24.095
What do you do?

25:24.358 --> 25:25.729
He's the best jockey you'll ever meet, Ben.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.804
As good a horseman
as the both of us.

25:28.874 --> 25:30.827
So what can we possibly
do for you, Mr. Dunne?

25:32.050 --> 25:36.105
The lad's got himself into some
serious trouble with the Trapps,

25:36.106 --> 25:36.306
The lad's got himself
into some serious trouble,

25:36.506 --> 25:38.933
Oops, haven't we all!
That true?

25:40.061 --> 25:42.427
Me and my mate, Daniel Ryan,
robbed a fella...

25:42.981 --> 25:44.061
then got ourselves nabbed.

25:44.380 --> 25:47.338
We were supposed to show for trial
but I bolted.

25:47.582 --> 25:49.365
There's a warrant out for his arrest,

25:49.645 --> 25:51.908
if caught, they'll
throw him in the cells.

25:52.330 --> 25:55.729
You're lookin' to join with us.
Is that what you want?

25:56.246 --> 25:57.213
More than anything!

26:02.419 --> 26:04.560
Despite what the papers
encourage you to imagine,

26:06.382 --> 26:07.781
this life you want is not easy.

26:10.629 --> 26:12.751
In fact, most days, it's nothing
short of hell on earth.

26:13.737 --> 26:16.216
One false step,
one bad judgement,

26:17.314 --> 26:19.183
you could be shot dead
or made to dance or nothin'.

26:20.532 --> 26:21.537
Understand?

26:22.654 --> 26:24.701
Seems you're here now because
you made some bad choices.

26:25.799 --> 26:27.180
You sure you're not
just making another?

26:27.574 --> 26:30.119
Now, now! No need to
insult our friend here!

26:30.318 --> 26:32.111
He needs to know the nature
of what he seeks, Jack.

26:33.088 --> 26:34.825
We do this because we
have no recoutrse left.

26:36.459 --> 26:37.369
Not for a lark

26:38.017 --> 26:39.613
and not because we want
our names in the papers.

26:39.961 --> 26:42.317
He's speaking for himself.
You ride with us, John...

26:44.088 --> 26:45.732
you can never again
lead a normal life.

26:46.764 --> 26:48.783
With respect, Mr. Hall...

26:50.276 --> 26:51.872
my life has never been normal.

27:00.890 --> 27:02.233
Welcome aboard, Johnny!

27:44.533 --> 27:45.200
Get out!

27:47.867 --> 27:48.778
Hand those over, maam.

27:49.810 --> 27:50.515
I'll take that!

27:55.311 --> 27:56.522
There, Mister!
Huh?

27:56.804 --> 27:58.710
Move your hands, I'll blow
your bloody brains out.

28:41.511 --> 28:42.619
This is what I like to see.

28:43.548 --> 28:44.769
Listen to this,
listen to this!

28:45.466 --> 28:48.096
I regret to state that the
reports of Gilbert's resurgence...

28:48.293 --> 28:49.373
turns out to be fact.

28:49.692 --> 28:51.448
He returns to his
favorite hunting grounds,

28:51.673 --> 28:55.420
bringing with him a fresh hand,
the young John Dunne

28:55.540 --> 28:56.134
There's more!

28:56.735 --> 28:59.824
He is the very beau ideal
of a modern bushranger,

29:00.265 --> 29:04.256
youthful and daring, with the
agility and nature of a tiger cat.

29:04.594 --> 29:06.842
a splendid rider and a
thorough bushman.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.039
What can I say,
I'm famous already!

29:09.077 --> 29:11.067
Never have the public
more to dread

29:11.273 --> 29:14.315
or the authorities, a more
formidable gang to deal with

29:14.935 --> 29:15.620
than now.

29:16.587 --> 29:18.569
Wooh!
What'd I tell ya, huh?

29:18.978 --> 29:20.405
Was I right about
our boy here, Ben?

29:20.668 --> 29:22.640
You were right.
And another thing,

29:22.875 --> 29:23.541
from here on,

29:23.776 --> 29:26.649
we start teaching manners to any
wretches that help the police against us.

29:26.769 --> 29:27.926
How do we
teach them manners?

29:28.374 --> 29:31.284
Simple! We burn their property
to the bloody stumps.

29:31.322 --> 29:34.270
No! We start that kind of work and
the country'll get too hot to hold us.

29:34.702 --> 29:35.256
Wrong!

29:35.376 --> 29:37.575
It'll make anyone think twice
before crossing us.

29:37.771 --> 29:40.381
What it will do is make every
settler turn out and hunt us down.

29:41.632 --> 29:45.736
We wouldn't last a month.
Fine, I'll just shoot them, then.

29:48.365 --> 29:50.393
You do so and you'll
have me to reckon with.

29:50.797 --> 29:52.600
I won't take the life of
another man who hasn't

29:52.720 --> 29:53.849
first tried to take mine.

29:54.112 --> 29:55.257
You can do what you like

29:55.377 --> 29:57.567
but I mean to shoot any man
I find helping the Trapps.

29:57.764 --> 30:01.032
Or any trap I come across.
No, you won't.

30:16.063 --> 30:17.133
Hello, lass!

30:18.636 --> 30:19.762
Can you open that for me?

30:21.152 --> 30:22.617
I'd really like to keep this.

30:23.143 --> 30:23.622
Why?

30:23.659 --> 30:25.143
Because it's very
important to me.

30:25.263 --> 30:26.110
It's very special.

30:27.177 --> 30:28.266
Alright.
Thank you.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.336
Hat, please, sir.

30:31.796 --> 30:34.810
That bag's... Whoo!
Thank you.

30:39.048 --> 30:40.550
Mr. Fancy Britches!

30:41.226 --> 30:42.860
You travel quite loaded, I'd expect.

30:44.137 --> 30:46.794
Turn out your pockets.
I refuse.

30:48.695 --> 30:49.831
Wanna rethink your answer?

30:50.132 --> 30:51.925
No. Go ahead, shoot me,
if you're going to.

30:53.813 --> 30:55.127
Not in front of these ladies.

30:56.451 --> 30:58.329
But I will rip you trousers off,
tie you to that tree

30:58.449 --> 31:00.188
and leave you there with your
tallywhacker hanging out,

31:00.414 --> 31:01.653
for all to see

31:02.708 --> 31:03.994
John Gilbert, is it?

31:05.092 --> 31:06.820
Happy Jack, to you, sir.

31:07.618 --> 31:10.520
Now, turn out your pockets!

31:16.130 --> 31:16.637
Better!

31:18.383 --> 31:19.857
I can do yo
better than all that.

31:21.031 --> 31:24.402
I will write you out a check for 50 pounds,
in exchange for the loan of a revolver

31:25.332 --> 31:29.482
and a duel, at 20 paces,
this instant.

31:33.714 --> 31:36.465
Bless you, sir. That is the
kindest proposition I've had all day

31:37.367 --> 31:40.202
but I must regrettably decline.
I didn't think you'd be game enough.

31:41.207 --> 31:41.854
What did you say?

31:43.378 --> 31:47.509
I did not think you would be
game enough, Happy Jack!

31:49.181 --> 31:50.467
I'm not game enough?

31:56.929 --> 31:59.174
Keep your check! I'll show you
how fucking game I am,

31:59.183 --> 32:00.206
you Jimmy Grant cock!

32:00.483 --> 32:02.680
You want me to blow your bloody
brains out all over the highway?

32:02.914 --> 32:03.741
I'm game for that!

32:04.370 --> 32:05.224
What are you waiting for?

32:05.252 --> 32:06.698
20 paces and turn!
Jack!

32:07.049 --> 32:07.688
Cool off!

32:07.808 --> 32:10.082
He's the one talking fight
and I'll gladly give him one!

32:12.937 --> 32:16.345
If you want a shooting match with us,
bring your own revolver next time.

32:17.799 --> 32:18.917
Get back to work!

32:21.020 --> 32:24.334
You two, open your purses
Right now, come on, move!

32:31.978 --> 32:34.391
So, when does the fun start?

32:38.043 --> 32:38.935
Won't be long now.

33:08.149 --> 33:08.910
Major, sir!

33:09.586 --> 33:11.267
Whole gang, right here!

33:19.333 --> 33:23.446
Hey, you, drop it! Drop it or
I'll blow your bloody head off!

33:25.068 --> 33:26.590
Get back inside, now!

33:30.899 --> 33:34.120
Jack, we got 2 more!
Let's go!

33:50.787 --> 33:52.724
Surrender!

34:04.722 --> 34:07.014
Draw back!
Draw back!

34:07.044 --> 34:10.261
Go! You'll draw their fire, Debby!
Get away from the coach!

34:14.190 --> 34:15.444
Surrender!

34:15.445 --> 34:16.666
Saved you, Boss!

34:18.150 --> 34:19.043
Bloody traps!

34:19.076 --> 34:20.958
There!
Stand fast!

34:21.387 --> 34:23.368
Stand fast, you bastards!

34:23.391 --> 34:24.841
Surrender!
Never...

34:24.870 --> 34:26.956
Give in to a
bloody bushranger!

34:54.663 --> 34:56.384
Smartest thing you ever did.

35:23.350 --> 35:24.125
Get out!

35:33.024 --> 35:36.412
Eureka! It's all here!
Hoards of cash!

35:36.532 --> 35:37.194
Get all of it!

35:38.552 --> 35:40.919
What the hell?
Mr. Hall,

35:41.435 --> 35:42.656
The bank notes
are all cut in half.

35:48.274 --> 35:49.129
Check them all.

35:53.088 --> 35:55.867
Why are they cut in half?
I said why are they cut in half!

35:56.393 --> 35:58.402
That's the way the banks
are sending them, these days,

35:58.430 --> 35:59.736
you've left them little choice.

35:59.773 --> 36:01.961
And where are the other halves?
They come at a later time.

36:01.998 --> 36:02.618
When?

36:02.856 --> 36:04.856
Nobody knows,
that's the whole point!

36:08.499 --> 36:10.368
Mr. Hall, they're all the same.

36:11.620 --> 36:13.751
Take them with us.
But they're worthless!

36:13.871 --> 36:15.808
So are the other halves,
if they don't get these back.

36:44.767 --> 36:47.668
You heard me out there.
I gave him fair warning.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.893
That's what the bloody fool
got for not standing.

36:50.109 --> 36:53.011
Fair warning or not, today,
you branded us as killers.

36:54.597 --> 36:56.457
Half the country will be
gunning for us now.

36:57.180 --> 36:58.673
This is who we are, Ben!

36:59.334 --> 37:01.080
This is what we do.
It's us or it's them.

37:01.110 --> 37:03.240
We're worth more to our friends
dead than we are alive.

37:03.734 --> 37:05.311
How long do you think
we can last, Jack?

37:08.772 --> 37:11.626
Any more talk of shooting people,
I'll bore a hole through you myself!

37:13.682 --> 37:14.668
We're getting out of the district.

37:42.610 --> 37:46.600
...coming straight towards me and
I said: "Stand! Stand! Stand! Bang!"

37:46.856 --> 37:48.321
One shot, right here.

37:48.725 --> 37:50.237
One on the ground!
Fellow's a pip!

37:51.241 --> 37:52.791
Never seen a dead man before.

37:53.214 --> 37:56.003
So, it's the truth: what
happened to Sgt. Perry?

37:57.308 --> 38:00.125
Be careful, Ben, what I mind,
a few boys'll hear,

38:01.977 --> 38:04.775
but i know a lot of fellas that would
turn you in, given half the chance.

38:05.812 --> 38:06.694
Watch you back.

38:33.942 --> 38:36.468
You got enough pistols there, boy?

38:38.684 --> 38:39.472
Beg your pardon?

38:39.669 --> 38:42.167
Have you got enough
pistols there, boy?

38:48.201 --> 38:50.004
Missing one?
Yeah...

38:50.210 --> 38:52.783
a great big long one
right between your legs!

38:55.346 --> 38:57.806
Go away., old damn Mordemaker!
Oi!

39:06.007 --> 39:08.768
Any last wisecrack before I
blow your head inside out?

39:08.798 --> 39:09.932
Hold your horses, son.

39:10.045 --> 39:12.045
He's just havin' a lark.
Hubert, let him pay!

39:12.366 --> 39:14.300
No one wants to see
a man killed today.

39:22.829 --> 39:25.411
No, of course not,

39:25.890 --> 39:30.031
but I reckon I know what
everyone would like to see.

39:33.273 --> 39:35.714
Put my manhood to
the test, if you dare.

40:30.110 --> 40:32.673
Gentlemen, the
next round is on me!

40:45.324 --> 40:46.470
This one's jammed again.

40:47.704 --> 40:48.615
I'm not surprised.

40:50.155 --> 40:51.141
Yours never do.

40:53.254 --> 40:53.855
Really!

40:55.188 --> 40:56.296
Trantors are handmade.

40:57.396 --> 40:58.495
Beautiful craftsmanship.

41:00.392 --> 41:01.415
Besy revolvers in the world!

41:05.781 --> 41:07.415
Reckon I'd like to get one for myself.

41:12.894 --> 41:16.575
Mr. Hall, why did you
become a bushranger?

41:17.950 --> 41:18.993
Couple of years back...

41:20.532 --> 41:23.349
the police took a set against me because
I was friendly with Frank Gardner.

41:24.419 --> 41:26.691
Pottinger threw me in the lobs
for almost a month.

41:27.298 --> 41:30.011
After that, I helped Gardner
with the escort delivery.

41:30.727 --> 41:31.957
That's how it all started, anyway.

41:35.347 --> 41:37.760
Gilbert told me that...

41:38.943 --> 41:42.718
you were..
He says you have a wife.

41:45.427 --> 41:46.432
I had a wife...

41:47.596 --> 41:48.169
once...

41:49.145 --> 41:49.990
that's a long story

41:50.817 --> 41:51.803
Well, I got all night.

41:57.915 --> 42:01.981
We were married about 4 years
and she was beautiful.

42:03.488 --> 42:04.033
Biddy...

42:05.528 --> 42:07.228
had a friend by the
name of Jim Taylor.

42:08.712 --> 42:09.895
He didn't live far from us...

42:12.655 --> 42:17.268
flesh-eatin' loudmouth type. He
would visit her when I was away.

42:22.947 --> 42:23.764
I got wise to them, though.

42:24.984 --> 42:28.139
Gave him a stern warning to stay away.
Gave Biddy the same.

42:33.482 --> 42:34.909
Can't say I was gentle about it, however.

42:41.089 --> 42:44.779
A short time afterwards, I was
away mustering wild horses,

42:48.035 --> 42:51.209
and while I was away,
she ran off with him.

42:52.458 --> 42:54.101
Worst of all, she took my son with her.

42:57.346 --> 42:58.538
He was about 3, at the time.

43:00.933 --> 43:01.712
What did you do?

43:04.106 --> 43:05.336
Looked all over for them.

43:07.779 --> 43:09.319
For a long time,
I did nothing else.

43:10.417 --> 43:12.051
Not a single soul knew
where they'd gone.

43:13.075 --> 43:14.154
I'm sorry to hear that.

43:17.404 --> 43:19.855
I swore, the day I
found Jim Taylor,

43:21.742 --> 43:23.686
I'd put a bullet
in his wicked hide.

43:24.841 --> 43:27.649
You'll never know true hatred until
someone destroys your family.

43:40.156 --> 43:43.573
Ben, you know it's\
Christmas next week, don't you?

43:44.660 --> 43:46.387
I didn't realize.
Well, it is.

43:47.260 --> 43:49.580
And I was thinkin', we
oughta enjoy some festivities..

43:50.472 --> 43:51.054
for a change of pace.

43:52.378 --> 43:54.631
What do you say to that, Johnny?
Sounds grand to me.

43:55.936 --> 43:57.711
We're not all that far
away from Binda, are we?

43:58.208 --> 43:59.476
What do you say,
we drop in and...

44:00.424 --> 44:03.457
see some old friends.
Sounds like an idea.

44:05.084 --> 44:08.079
Yes, it is.
Brace yourself, Mr. Dunne!

44:08.421 --> 44:12.093
We are about to have ourselves
a very Merry Christmas!

44:34.866 --> 44:37.645
Benjamin, come in.
Where have you been?

44:41.979 --> 44:43.820
I was startin' to think you
were never coming back.

44:45.369 --> 44:46.439
I said I would, didn't I?

44:46.899 --> 44:49.144
But it's been so long, you had
me worried something happened.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.782
or maybe you went and found
yourself some other Doxie.

44:56.101 --> 44:56.899
There's no one else.

44:58.674 --> 45:00.711
What are you doin' here, sneakin'
up in the middle of the night?

45:02.018 --> 45:04.187
Gilbert and I are camped just
outside of town with a new fellow.

45:04.722 --> 45:06.187
I came to see if you'd
like to join us tomorrow.

45:06.759 --> 45:08.647
Of course, I'll bring
Ellen and Peggy too.

45:09.360 --> 45:10.572
Gilbert would
like that very much.

45:12.643 --> 45:14.906
And what about tonight?
You goin' back?

45:16.276 --> 45:17.215
Not if I don't have to.

45:24.890 --> 45:25.698
Have you missed me?

45:29.181 --> 45:29.904
What do you think?

45:31.762 --> 45:32.889
You wonder, sometimes...

45:33.678 --> 45:36.401
Seems you'd rather be out there in
the cold and rain than here with me.

45:41.180 --> 45:42.786
Can't exactly
live a normal life.

45:43.943 --> 45:45.042
I suppose not.

46:43.909 --> 46:44.801
Can't sleep?

46:47.631 --> 46:48.317
No.

46:49.115 --> 46:50.392
Your safe here, Ben.

46:51.500 --> 46:52.664
No one knows you're here.

46:53.725 --> 46:54.749
What is it, what's wrong?

46:56.760 --> 46:58.328
I'm alright.
No, you're not.

46:59.116 --> 47:00.525
I've never seen you like this.

47:01.154 --> 47:02.356
Some bad things
have happened, that's all.

47:03.210 --> 47:06.083
Like what?
You don't want to know.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.013
Yes, I do.

47:08.689 --> 47:09.995
Perhaps, I don't want
you to know.

47:10.765 --> 47:11.347
Why?

47:19.523 --> 47:20.021
Ben!

47:23.316 --> 47:24.697
I should go before first light.

47:38.428 --> 47:39.681
So, what's this Peggy girl like?

47:41.136 --> 47:42.150
Jack says she's pretty.

47:44.075 --> 47:44.826
She's pretty enough.

47:45.174 --> 47:48.066
And if she's anything like her sister,
you're in for a grand time.

47:53.790 --> 47:55.687
Woop! Careful,
don't spill it on me.

48:00.541 --> 48:03.705
Good Lord, would you look at
how long your hair is these days!

48:03.865 --> 48:06.391
I'm obliged to wear it long, for
I have times I need to dress

48:06.421 --> 48:08.578
in womens' clothes.
Oh, you do not!

48:08.608 --> 48:10.783
It's true, I
stand as a witness.

48:13.036 --> 48:15.449
Do you wear ladies' clothes?
Sometimes.

48:16.189 --> 48:17.034
Why?

48:17.268 --> 48:19.888
When I need to pass through
a town unrecognized, of course.

48:20.236 --> 48:22.846
And more, I fully intend

48:22.968 --> 48:26.855
to escape out of the country,
dressed in a petticoat.

48:28.187 --> 48:31.314
I bet you'd be the
ugliest girl I've ever seen!

48:32.093 --> 48:35.501
Some men showed interest.
You know what?

48:35.858 --> 48:38.543
You should all come to the
Boxing Day Ball with us next week,

48:38.843 --> 48:40.872
at the Flagg Hotel.
What do you say, Ben?

48:41.397 --> 48:43.606
Why not!
Happy now, huh,huh?

48:46.920 --> 48:49.024
For Christ's sake, Jack,
try to have a nice evening!

48:49.221 --> 48:51.212
Alright, alright!
We were leaving anyway.

48:53.162 --> 48:54.674
Her sweet honeypot
calls to me.

48:55.857 --> 48:58.232
You're such a vulgar man, Johnny Gilbert!
Yes!

48:58.392 --> 49:02.176
And you love a vulgar man. And I'm
the most vulgar man you've ever met!

49:02.894 --> 49:05.542
Put me down, you brute!
Oh, I plan to.

49:05.572 --> 49:06.537
Put me down!

49:06.567 --> 49:09.204
Come to think of it, I think it's
time we had some privacy, as well.

49:10.054 --> 49:10.974
Put me down!

49:13.089 --> 49:14.883
Look after your guest, John.
I will.

49:29.511 --> 49:31.623
Is it true that bushrangers
know how to treat ladies

49:31.653 --> 49:32.628
better than regular men?

49:34.452 --> 49:35.391
I don't know.

49:36.339 --> 49:37.907
Oh, well, that's what
Ellen claims, anyway.

49:38.452 --> 49:40.123
Says Gilbert knows
his way around quite well.

49:40.696 --> 49:43.034
I think bushrangers know how
to treat ladies pretty good.

49:45.010 --> 49:47.592
Go on, then.
Show me how.

50:16.720 --> 50:19.208
So? Tell us. Did you...

50:20.110 --> 50:21.837
tip the velvet,
get a bit of under?

50:22.119 --> 50:23.687
Shut up, Jack!
You did!

50:24.005 --> 50:25.245
You got her heels up!

50:25.376 --> 50:27.592
Ben, our little Johnny's
all grown up now.

50:40.455 --> 50:41.244
Goddammit!

50:42.718 --> 50:44.192
Doesn't anybody
use cash anymore?

50:44.467 --> 50:45.866
Now it's all worthless checks.

50:46.899 --> 50:48.195
At this rate,
we'll never have enough.

50:54.038 --> 50:54.798
you find something?

50:56.404 --> 50:57.915
I don't think you want
to hear this, Mr. Hall.

50:59.878 --> 51:00.441
Read it.

51:04.791 --> 51:07.364
Mrs. Hall, wife of Ben Hall,
the bushranger,

51:07.477 --> 51:09.646
accompanied by the
notorious Jim Taylor,

51:09.676 --> 51:11.665
took out a summons
against Bill Hall

51:11.695 --> 51:13.881
for the illegal detention
of Ben Hall's child...

51:14.625 --> 51:16.541
but the parties concerned
made no appearance.

51:16.982 --> 51:19.489
The child, having been
surrendered back to Taylor,

51:19.621 --> 51:21.301
who now assumes his guardianship.

51:54.179 --> 51:56.629
Jim, not in front of Henry!

51:57.221 --> 51:59.042
Take your drinking
outside, right now.

52:03.286 --> 52:04.808
I got things to do, anyway.

52:28.553 --> 52:28.873
Ben!

52:30.441 --> 52:32.704
Wait, listen to me!
Get your horse.

52:33.901 --> 52:34.783
We're going for a ride.

52:39.159 --> 52:40.051
A ride where?

52:40.372 --> 52:43.086
Get your bloody horse tethered or
...I'll be makin' it for you.

52:45.227 --> 52:46.983
Stay right here!
Benjamin!

52:47.367 --> 52:50.325
Benjamin, go, get out of here!
Go, go!

52:50.605 --> 52:52.755
I said get on your horse,
Taylor, right now!

52:52.785 --> 52:55.948
No, don't you shoot my father,
Ben Hall!

52:55.978 --> 52:57.340
Don't you shoot him!

52:57.485 --> 52:59.147
Don't you shoot my Dah!
Henry,

52:59.177 --> 53:01.316
I'm your Dah, I'm
your Dah, remember?

53:01.346 --> 53:01.974
No!

53:23.445 --> 53:24.469
You will tell him.

53:26.647 --> 53:28.600
You will tell him
who his father really is.

54:54.487 --> 54:55.735
Try it on, might be 7.

54:56.233 --> 54:58.073
You have such
beautiful things, Mrs. Morris.

54:58.103 --> 54:58.853
Oh, thank you.

55:01.453 --> 55:02.458
Evening, ladies.

55:04.476 --> 55:06.720
Heading to the Ball, later tonight?
Indeed, we are!

55:08.035 --> 55:11.030
Helen, you're not thinking of
wearing crenoline, are you?

55:11.993 --> 55:14.012
I am, I'm old enough.

55:14.265 --> 55:16.800
Leave them alone, Edward.
Let the ladies have their fun.

55:17.242 --> 55:20.256
So tell me, who are the
lucky fellas, taking you?

55:20.787 --> 55:22.853
Big surprise.
You'll see.

55:23.501 --> 55:24.965
Well, I can't wait
to meet them.

55:31.208 --> 55:32.851
Bail up.
Easy, easy!

55:33.095 --> 55:36.447
Stay calm, everyone, calm!

55:37.715 --> 55:39.658
Howdy, there,
Miss McKennon, Miss Knox.

55:39.846 --> 55:41.358
Evening, sir.
Evening, sir.

55:43.487 --> 55:44.210
I know you!

55:45.918 --> 55:48.632
Gilbert, John Gilbert!
I'm flattered you remember.

55:49.477 --> 55:50.764
I suppose you're Ben Hall.

55:52.098 --> 55:53.075
I am that gentleman.

55:56.981 --> 55:59.141
Any firearms on the premises?
No!

55:59.610 --> 56:01.535
Cash?
Only some silver.

56:02.441 --> 56:03.089
Only silver.

56:08.037 --> 56:09.342
A man in your position, Morris

56:22.278 --> 56:24.354
I've heard you keep your
money in strange places.

56:26.734 --> 56:28.274
Helen, you told them.
How could you?

56:28.415 --> 56:30.377
I would do nothing
of the sort Miss Morris.

56:31.560 --> 56:32.706
You can lock up for tonight.

56:34.302 --> 56:35.889
We'll be escorting you
and your wife to the Ball.

56:37.470 --> 56:38.512
What do you want from me?

56:38.869 --> 56:40.315
Far too dangerous,
leaving you outside,

56:41.798 --> 56:43.197
being a former policeman and all.

56:43.592 --> 56:45.470
Now, go let your wife
change her dress.

57:17.688 --> 57:21.350
Ladies and gentlemen, please
excuse our raucous entrance

57:21.519 --> 57:24.711
but I will have your
undivided attention.

57:26.147 --> 57:28.551
My name is John Gilbert

57:28.973 --> 57:32.194
and with me are my mates,
Ben Hall and John Dunn.

57:32.551 --> 57:34.335
No doubt, you
have heard of us.

57:34.987 --> 57:35.776
But don't be alarmed.

57:36.330 --> 57:38.076
We are here for
the same reason as you.,

57:39.785 --> 57:40.649
to have a bit of fun!

57:40.902 --> 57:42.799
No one is to leave
without my permission first.

57:45.071 --> 57:45.625
Do that

57:48.063 --> 57:49.049
and there'll be no trouble.

57:51.359 --> 57:52.101
Fiddler, proceed!

57:55.530 --> 57:56.694
Come now, ladies and gentlemen,

57:56.826 --> 57:58.610
let us all liquor and dance.

57:58.732 --> 57:59.718
first round is on me.

58:41.928 --> 58:43.731
John, you're up!

01:00:02.083 --> 01:00:03.154
Ben, how about a drink?

01:00:04.158 --> 01:00:05.564
A drink, a Morris?

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:09.851
Boys, are you bloody mad?

01:00:10.311 --> 01:00:11.766
You know what their
capture is worth?

01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:16.630
25 hundred pounds!

01:00:17.477 --> 01:00:19.392
Now, I'll make a rush on them.

01:00:20.472 --> 01:00:21.956
Anyone game enough to join me?

01:00:22.087 --> 01:00:23.092
Sure, I'm in.

01:00:23.233 --> 01:00:25.665
For a slice of fed like that?
As am I.

01:00:25.806 --> 01:00:26.069
Good.

01:00:33.941 --> 01:00:36.654
Pistols goin' off around
women and children, Morris...

01:00:36.684 --> 01:00:37.828
They've been drinkin'.

01:00:38.299 --> 01:00:39.445
They won't be themselves.

01:00:39.604 --> 01:00:40.834
They're not doing any harm.

01:00:41.069 --> 01:00:43.238
Oh, right, if we sit
here and do nothing,

01:00:43.905 --> 01:00:46.712
What does it make us, hm?
Cowards!

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.360
Leave him, leave him,
leave him be.

01:00:53.242 --> 01:00:54.360
we bide our time.

01:00:54.933 --> 01:00:56.200
Let them drink a little more.

01:00:56.416 --> 01:00:58.266
You fellas take
Gilbert and Dunn.

01:01:01.311 --> 01:01:02.484
Leave Ben Hall to me.

01:01:42.813 --> 01:01:44.879
What's wrong?
Wait right here.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.038
Morris!

01:01:50.371 --> 01:01:52.437
Stand, you bloody dog
or I'll shoot you!

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.774
We hear whispers of dirty talk
coming from this room.

01:01:56.648 --> 01:01:57.277
Morris!

01:02:05.251 --> 01:02:07.129
For those of who who crave
to take our lives

01:02:07.159 --> 01:02:08.566
for the blood money
on our hides,

01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:11.758
have the courage to step
forward and take it now.

01:02:16.329 --> 01:02:17.071
What are you waiting for?

01:02:21.193 --> 01:02:21.747
Take it now.

01:02:35.249 --> 01:02:37.868
Any man, thirsting for the blood
money on my head, can earn it.

01:02:39.177 --> 01:02:43.261
I'll fight you all on the street,
one after the other.

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:49.047
Did we tell you to stop?
Keep playing!

01:03:05.087 --> 01:03:09.847
<i>As I was crossing over
the Abercrombie mountains,</i>

01:03:09.877 --> 01:03:14.420
<i>I met Sir Fredrick Pottinger
and his money he was counting</i>

01:03:14.551 --> 01:03:18.966
<i>I then produced my pistol
to acquaint him of his danger</i>

01:03:18.996 --> 01:03:23.736
<i>saying stand and deliver
for I am a Beauford stranger</i>

01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.914
<i>Now it's early the next morning
about six o'clock or seven</i>

01:03:38.091 --> 01:03:42.770
<i>There were troopers all around me
in numbers odd and even</i>

01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:47.833
<i>but Jenny had got 3 charges
and she dampened them with water</i>

01:03:47.863 --> 01:03:52.710
<i>Oh, the devil will take her mother
or favorite sons or daughters</i>

01:04:09.439 --> 01:04:11.956
<i>...on the Abercrombie mountain</i>

01:04:11.986 --> 01:04:17.045
but they didn't take my piss from me
and I knocked down all their...

01:04:17.075 --> 01:04:21.942
and I made up all my...
to Sir Fred and all his gentry

01:04:32.271 --> 01:04:33.429
Where's Morris?

01:04:43.064 --> 01:04:44.566
Jack, Morris is gone!

01:04:45.336 --> 01:04:46.068
Move, move!

01:04:55.354 --> 01:04:56.387
Morris!

01:05:01.776 --> 01:05:02.819
Morris!

01:05:03.632 --> 01:05:05.087
get back here, now!

01:05:08.317 --> 01:05:10.007
Morris, you bastard!

01:05:16.314 --> 01:05:17.769
This is your last chance!

01:05:34.229 --> 01:05:35.365
What happened, where is he?

01:05:35.609 --> 01:05:37.515
The bastard was trying
to set loose our horses.

01:05:37.797 --> 01:05:39.046
He's gone!
Christ,

01:05:39.076 --> 01:05:41.140
he'll have every troop from
Golburn down here in no time

01:05:41.609 --> 01:05:43.694
So much for our fine evening!
So, what do we do?

01:05:44.306 --> 01:05:46.147
I'm going to burn his store
down to bloody stumps,

01:05:46.588 --> 01:05:48.672
right now!
Keep everyone here.

01:05:48.973 --> 01:05:50.954
Please, please, I beg you!

01:05:51.229 --> 01:05:53.267
Don't burn it down.
You'll ruin us.

01:05:53.539 --> 01:05:54.976
Your husband is
nothing but a dog

01:05:55.276 --> 01:05:57.765
and if I ever come across him again,
that day will be his last.

01:05:57.889 --> 01:06:01.373
Please, don't do this to us.
Please!

01:06:03.316 --> 01:06:05.213
Nobody leaves this building
for the next hour.

01:06:44.281 --> 01:06:46.835
Do it in,
serves the bugger right!

01:06:47.145 --> 01:06:48.460
Yeah, serves him right!

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:35.997
Who could that be?

01:08:36.823 --> 01:08:37.941
I know who I hope it is.

01:08:45.679 --> 01:08:47.247
Who are you?
What do you want?

01:08:51.997 --> 01:08:54.578
You're all charged with aiding
and abetting the Hall gang

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:56.504
and the commission of arson.
You're under arrest

01:08:56.533 --> 01:08:58.006
and will be coming
with us to Galban.

01:08:58.692 --> 01:08:59.386
that is all.

01:09:02.836 --> 01:09:03.408
Hey...

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.160
I didn't... I wasn't...
I wasn't there...

01:09:40.171 --> 01:09:42.038
Godd evening, Miss.
Good evening, sir.

01:09:43.326 --> 01:09:45.560
So, who are you, then?
Harry Nelson.

01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:47.964
Well Harry Nelson, you'll be
minding our horses.

01:09:48.255 --> 01:09:49.381
Got that?
Alright.

01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:51.617
You make a run for it,
we'll let them loose.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:54.734
I'll blow your brains out.

01:09:58.570 --> 01:10:02.101
Everybody, outside!
This instant!

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.744
Faster! Move!

01:10:04.514 --> 01:10:05.969
Come on! Move! Move!

01:10:06.864 --> 01:10:08.301
Move!
Bring it in there.

01:10:11.052 --> 01:10:12.855
Alright, everyone. listen up!

01:10:13.371 --> 01:10:15.531
Empty out the
contents of your jacket

01:10:15.933 --> 01:10:18.018
place it in your hats.
Hold them out for me to see.

01:10:18.262 --> 01:10:20.722
I catch anyone holdin' out on me,
you'll get a good throttlin'.

01:10:20.752 --> 01:10:22.722
Understand? Good!
Miss? Step inside, please.

01:10:23.314 --> 01:10:25.323
Alright, report!
Starting with you.

01:10:26.424 --> 01:10:28.969
What's that? What have
you got? Let's see it!

01:10:38.925 --> 01:10:40.747
Would you be kind enough to
open all the others for me?

01:10:41.639 --> 01:10:42.315
Of course.

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:28.140
What is it, Samuel
Those were gunshots, just now.

01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:30.537
I swear, it's a dream.
Mr. Nelson!

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.865
Mr. Nelson! Mr. Nelson!

01:11:35.109 --> 01:11:36.668
There are bushrangers
at Kelly's Hotel

01:11:36.865 --> 01:11:38.631
and them boys
had Harry with them!

01:11:39.292 --> 01:11:41.048
Christ, what was all
that racket about Johnny?

01:11:41.226 --> 01:11:42.794
I chased up a fella
headed this way.

01:11:42.824 --> 01:11:43.498
Oh, you did?

01:11:44.362 --> 01:11:44.954
good for ya!

01:11:45.455 --> 01:11:47.437
The traps'll be here any minute,
I'm telling ya!

01:11:47.467 --> 01:11:49.530
Not likely, they're all out in
the bush, looking for us.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:51.474
You don't know that!
Yes, I do.

01:11:51.504 --> 01:11:53.887
Jack, call us all downstairs.

01:11:58.438 --> 01:11:59.574
Ben, Johnny
wants to see you.

01:12:00.203 --> 01:12:02.062
I don't know.
Ask him about it.

01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:04.539
Please Sam, you don't
go out there by yourself.

01:12:04.569 --> 01:12:06.320
At least, wait for the
others to get back.

01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:09.209
It'll be too late by then,
they've got our boy, Lizzy.

01:12:10.362 --> 01:12:12.287
Plesse, Sam, you don't go up there!
now, look,

01:12:12.317 --> 01:12:14.334
Now, look, I'm just
going to do my best.

01:12:15.244 --> 01:12:15.770
Wait here.

01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.949
What's the trouble, John?

01:12:20.079 --> 01:12:21.196
We got what bwe came for.

01:12:21.328 --> 01:12:22.886
Why the hell are
we lagging around?

01:12:23.196 --> 01:12:25.168
Jack wants to find himself
a pair of boots to his liking.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:28.398
Mr. Hall, if there are any traps in town,
they'll be all over us, any time now.

01:12:28.586 --> 01:12:29.929
Then go outside and
keep good watch.

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:42.406
Dad, Dad, have you heard?

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:43.993
Hall's gang have
bailed up the hotel

01:12:44.023 --> 01:12:45.063
i'm on my way there now.

01:12:45.093 --> 01:12:46.997
they've got your brother with them.
Can I come with you?

01:12:47.027 --> 01:12:48.547
Alright, but keep
at a good distance.

01:12:58.265 --> 01:12:59.617
Jack, we got company!

01:13:01.913 --> 01:13:02.336
Jack!

01:13:24.059 --> 01:13:26.030
Not one step closer!

01:13:26.359 --> 01:13:26.838
Wait here.

01:13:27.767 --> 01:13:30.068
Get back or
I'll shoot you!

01:13:32.338 --> 01:13:33.305
Dad!

01:13:45.558 --> 01:13:46.225
Dad!

01:14:10.535 --> 01:14:11.089
Ben?

01:14:19.281 --> 01:14:20.389
That's my Da.

01:14:21.253 --> 01:14:22.417
That's my Da!

01:14:22.727 --> 01:14:25.225
You shot my Da, you bastard!

01:14:25.255 --> 01:14:26.802
God damn you,boy!

01:14:27.056 --> 01:14:30.051
Nelson was a husband and
a father of 8 children!

01:14:30.902 --> 01:14:32.123
John, what's going on?

01:14:32.884 --> 01:14:35.654
Shot one of the bloody traps.
The other one bolted.

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:40.698
Da's dead!

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:00.742
Ah, just what I wanted, ah!

01:15:02.038 --> 01:15:04.132
What are you doing?
What does it look like?

01:15:05.212 --> 01:15:06.301
Now, I can't use it anymore.

01:15:25.443 --> 01:15:26.758
What the bloody hell was that?

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:28.298
I didn't know what to do,
I'm sorry!

01:15:28.438 --> 01:15:30.316
It just happened!
You're wanted for murder, John.

01:15:30.814 --> 01:15:32.589
That means when they
catch you, they'll hang you.

01:15:33.133 --> 01:15:33.866
What were you thinking?

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:36.413
You left me alone out there!
What was I supposed to do?

01:15:36.443 --> 01:15:38.272
You coulda just shot him
in the leg for Christ's sake.

01:15:38.302 --> 01:15:40.479
Instead, you blew the poor
bastard to kingdom come!

01:15:40.509 --> 01:15:42.122
I said I was sorry, alright?

01:15:42.152 --> 01:15:43.525
No need to be sorry, Johnny.

01:15:43.916 --> 01:15:45.375
You did what
was needed, that's all.

01:15:47.038 --> 01:15:48.932
You want the
whole country against us, Jack.

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:49.805
Is that what you want?

01:15:49.835 --> 01:15:50.900
It already is!

01:15:52.446 --> 01:15:53.585
And if they're
coming for us,

01:15:54.199 --> 01:15:56.285
I'm taking as many traps
with me as I can.

01:15:56.996 --> 01:15:58.831
God damn you,
the pair of you!

01:16:00.710 --> 01:16:02.204
You're as mad as
you are stupid!

01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:04.290
You think you're innocent
in all this?

01:16:04.612 --> 01:16:06.402
That you ain't got
no blood on your hands?

01:16:06.432 --> 01:16:08.829
I may not be innocent but
I've never killed a man.

01:16:08.859 --> 01:16:09.539
So what?

01:16:11.514 --> 01:16:13.689
You've taken shots at hundreds of them,

01:16:14.059 --> 01:16:16.707
Could've killed any
one of them at any time.

01:16:18.212 --> 01:16:19.573
But you always
were a lousy shot.

01:16:20.002 --> 01:16:22.074
I never miss
anything I fix to hit.

01:16:22.488 --> 01:16:24.338
I see. So, you're
just a coward, then.

01:16:27.134 --> 01:16:27.785
Say it again.

01:16:30.446 --> 01:16:31.408
Say it again, Jack.

01:16:33.524 --> 01:16:34.811
I said say it again!

01:16:47.944 --> 01:16:48.699
Where are you going?

01:17:12.198 --> 01:17:14.077
John, Come in quickly!

01:17:17.909 --> 01:17:18.338
John...

01:17:21.313 --> 01:17:22.215
What's happened?

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:26.209
What have you done?

01:17:29.967 --> 01:17:30.914
I shot a man.

01:17:33.412 --> 01:17:33.886
A trap?

01:17:34.796 --> 01:17:35.565
I'm sorry.

01:17:40.961 --> 01:17:41.864
Think I will stay here..

01:17:44.482 --> 01:17:45.770
No, you've gotta run.

01:17:46.067 --> 01:17:48.464
John, get away from the country
as fast as you can.

01:17:48.494 --> 01:17:49.811
Come with me, please.

01:17:50.166 --> 01:17:52.652
We'll go north, we'll
start a new life together.

01:17:53.081 --> 01:17:54.989
I'll look after you, Pegs.
I swear it.

01:17:55.369 --> 01:17:58.032
What about my sister?
She can come too.

01:17:58.639 --> 01:17:59.941
John, haven't you heard?

01:18:00.947 --> 01:18:03.581
3 weeks ago, we were all arrested
for what happened in Binda.

01:18:04.108 --> 01:18:06.372
Then let me go free
but Ellen and Chrissy...

01:18:06.846 --> 01:18:08.947
they've been sent to
Sydney to stand trial.

01:18:12.714 --> 01:18:14.594
We didn't know
we'd get them hurt.

01:18:20.895 --> 01:18:23.958
Come with me, please.

01:18:26.296 --> 01:18:30.083
I can't, I'm sorry.

01:18:52.813 --> 01:18:54.751
You say you want to
escape the country, Ben...

01:18:55.373 --> 01:18:56.024
do you mean that?

01:18:56.564 --> 01:18:57.895
Or is that just
cock and bull talk?

01:18:58.827 --> 01:19:00.929
No, it's true.
Good!

01:19:04.808 --> 01:19:07.190
Christine is in jail,
Ellen too.

01:19:07.945 --> 01:19:08.803
I thought you ought to know that.

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:34.642
Three long steps
I step it up to her

01:19:34.838 --> 01:19:40.994
Though knowing her
as she must be mine

01:19:41.145 --> 01:19:48.085
i would make you as happy
as any lady

01:19:48.612 --> 01:19:55.448
If you would grant me
one small rally

01:19:56.700 --> 01:20:04.187
She said: "Stand off,
you are deceiptful,

01:20:04.773 --> 01:20:10.929
you are deceiptful
and a false young man

01:20:10.959 --> 01:20:17.893
It is you that's caused
my poor heart for to wonder.

01:20:21.439 --> 01:20:23.999
Mr. Hall, there's more troopers
headed this way,

01:20:24.029 --> 01:20:25.064
not 2 miles off.

01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:28.787
God damn it,
we just got here!

01:20:29.246 --> 01:20:32.057
You can stay at my place tonught.
Come, on.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.798
May the Good Lord Bless you.

01:20:38.772 --> 01:20:41.066
Once they've passed through
the area, give us the all clear.

01:20:42.072 --> 01:20:42.560
Good lad.

01:20:57.457 --> 01:20:59.973
Well, we can say the gang was here
not more than 2 hours ago.

01:21:00.210 --> 01:21:01.009
And they were tipped off.

01:21:01.186 --> 01:21:02.562
Any idea where they went, sir?

01:21:03.095 --> 01:21:05.699
Couldn't tell you, sir.
Who tipped them off?

01:21:06.586 --> 01:21:07.948
Couldn't tell you that, either.

01:21:08.244 --> 01:21:10.892
Arrest him. I want everyone
here questioned.

01:21:11.528 --> 01:21:13.733
Their telegraph is still here,
I'll wager that.

01:21:17.508 --> 01:21:20.556
Him! That one, right there!

01:21:21.355 --> 01:21:22.258
You, there!

01:21:27.554 --> 01:21:28.575
What's your name, lad?

01:21:30.173 --> 01:21:31.933
Suttle.
Suttle.

01:21:32.937 --> 01:21:34.742
You got 2 choices, Mr. Suttle...

01:21:34.772 --> 01:21:37.835
you can tell us where they went
and we let you walk free

01:21:38.249 --> 01:21:38.959
no charges.

01:21:40.039 --> 01:21:43.516
You're facing 7 years in jail for
aiding and abetting bushrangers.

01:21:44.917 --> 01:21:48.705
So, what's it gonna be?
Where'd they go, Mr. Suttle?

01:22:01.743 --> 01:22:02.158
Ben!

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.229
Don't you shoot my Da!

01:22:07.233 --> 01:22:09.319
Benjamin!
<i>Benjamin!</i>

01:23:45.895 --> 01:23:46.576
Look out!

01:23:53.501 --> 01:23:54.625
Johnny, get your head down!

01:23:55.358 --> 01:23:56.704
Get into the fight, Johnny!

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:02.167
Come on!

01:24:05.703 --> 01:24:06.088
Jack!

01:24:06.635 --> 01:24:07.494
They're all over us!

01:24:09.018 --> 01:24:10.512
We have to get out of here,
right now!

01:24:11.102 --> 01:24:13.825
Give yourselves up!
We've got you surrounded!

01:24:16.873 --> 01:24:17.923
They're surrounding us!

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.216
Both of you,get out!

01:24:23.897 --> 01:24:25.302
No, it's murder out there.

01:24:25.613 --> 01:24:27.552
We have to or they'll
trap us like bloody rats.

01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:28.883
Come on!

01:24:30.047 --> 01:24:31.172
Go! Now!

01:24:31.512 --> 01:24:32.237
Follow me!

01:24:35.768 --> 01:24:36.922
They're getting out!

01:24:41.197 --> 01:24:42.307
Go on, Jim. Go on!

01:25:35.722 --> 01:25:36.935
Jesus, Ben's been hit!

01:25:37.823 --> 01:25:39.524
Where in the hell
did they come from?

01:25:39.554 --> 01:25:42.572
Burns must have sold us out!
Bloody bastard!

01:25:54.191 --> 01:25:57.299
We need to get back to the horses.
No chance, just run!

01:25:58.616 --> 01:25:59.119
Run!

01:26:21.529 --> 01:26:22.831
Keep running, Johnny, go!

01:26:26.376 --> 01:26:27.924
Come on, you bastards!

01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:29.448
I'm over here.

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:36.012
You want a bloody fight?
Come on!

01:26:51.603 --> 01:26:53.098
Just run, Jack. Go!

01:26:53.898 --> 01:26:55.422
Christ's sake, don't lose that!

01:27:28.369 --> 01:27:29.671
Where are we going?

01:27:32.418 --> 01:27:35.777
Hearse Hill isn't far from here.
We can get horses there.

01:27:36.635 --> 01:27:37.256
Come on!

01:28:08.601 --> 01:28:09.622
Wait! Stop!

01:28:19.987 --> 01:28:23.139
Benny, I can feel the ball,

01:28:23.479 --> 01:28:26.046
It's hit the bone...
Shit.

01:28:26.076 --> 01:28:27.984
Devil of a thing
to get hold of...

01:28:28.014 --> 01:28:29.094
Do what you have to.

01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:31.417
Just get the bastard thing out.

01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:33.413
Bite on this.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.119
Ready?

01:28:57.242 --> 01:28:58.109
Oh,yes.

01:28:59.249 --> 01:29:02.918
Oh, yes, my little darlin'.
Hold your hand out.

01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:10.856
Send that back to the traps, huh?
Alright?

01:29:15.585 --> 01:29:17.568
Detective James Pye...

01:29:17.938 --> 01:29:19.625
he's the fella
that had a go at you.

01:29:19.891 --> 01:29:22.658
Oh, he's also the
one who arrested Gardner.

01:29:23.146 --> 01:29:24.537
At Akers Creek, last year.

01:29:25.759 --> 01:29:28.348
Something else here,
you should know...

01:29:32.382 --> 01:29:36.895
Parliament has moved to pass
the Felons Apprehension Act,

01:29:37.384 --> 01:29:38.710
which would
summon and command

01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:42.054
John Gilbert, Benjamin Hall
and John Dunn to serve...

01:29:42.602 --> 01:29:43.771
surrender...

01:29:45.724 --> 01:29:49.490
to surrender themselves to
abide their trial respectively

01:29:49.919 --> 01:29:52.271
for the felony and murder
so charged upon them.

01:29:52.715 --> 01:29:55.008
If by the set date,
they have not surrendered,

01:29:55.038 --> 01:29:56.577
they will be declared outlaws,

01:29:57.391 --> 01:30:00.927
after which, any citizen may
apprehend or take said outlaws,

01:30:02.224 --> 01:30:02.949
dead or alive,

01:30:03.733 --> 01:30:07.328
without being accountable
for using any deadly weapon.

01:30:10.726 --> 01:30:13.374
What the hell does that mean?
It means that anyone can kill you.

01:30:14.114 --> 01:30:16.881
Anyone, no charges will be laid.

01:30:17.156 --> 01:30:18.695
What the hell gives them
the right to do that?

01:30:19.021 --> 01:30:21.655
They can't do that to us!
You hear? Thay can't!

01:30:21.685 --> 01:30:22.750
They bloody well can!

01:30:24.579 --> 01:30:25.289
And they will.

01:30:26.059 --> 01:30:30.957
...as this passed. You got
30 days to turn yourselves in.

01:30:30.987 --> 01:30:34.212
We are not turning ourselves
in top, none of us are!

01:30:35.284 --> 01:30:36.689
Certainly not
while we have these.

01:30:57.641 --> 01:30:59.875
We need to get out of the country
well before this Act is passed.

01:31:00.349 --> 01:31:03.086
I agree but with what?
We lost everything at Byrnes'

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:06.149
and we need a whole lot more.
What are you thinking, Ben?

01:31:07.095 --> 01:31:09.078
That we try something we
should've done a long time ago...

01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:14.523
sticking up a gold escort.
Which one?

01:31:15.287 --> 01:31:17.788
An escort leaves the Araloo in Deaton's
every week, bound for Sydney.

01:31:19.016 --> 01:31:20.673
Goes over the Blue Mountains,
through Majaor's Creek,

01:31:21.428 --> 01:31:22.686
that's where we hit it.
Perfect!

01:31:23.775 --> 01:31:26.128
You're not bloody serious!
You got a better idea?

01:31:26.158 --> 01:31:27.844
We've done this before,
Johnny. Don't worry.

01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:29.871
I would gather in\
half a dozen others...

01:31:30.049 --> 01:31:31.248
there's only 3 of us.

01:31:31.278 --> 01:31:33.985
Then, we'll get more fellas.
One more, to do it.

01:31:36.132 --> 01:31:37.079
Someone we can trust.

01:31:39.062 --> 01:31:40.482
Well, what about Daniel Ryan?

01:31:41.533 --> 01:31:42.864
He's be game for it,
I know he would.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:43.782
Know where he is?

01:31:44.927 --> 01:31:47.502
I think so, up in Berra
last I heard.

01:31:48.789 --> 01:31:49.573
Then go and get him.

01:31:56.191 --> 01:32:01.000
Ben, this is my mate, Dan Ryan.
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Hall.

01:32:02.465 --> 01:32:04.285
Dunn tells me you're up
for a bit of cross work

01:32:04.655 --> 01:32:05.883
Aye, the more, the merrier.

01:32:06.850 --> 01:32:08.271
Know what you're
getting yourself into, lad?

01:32:09.247 --> 01:32:09.765
I'm game.

01:32:14.175 --> 01:32:14.929
Welcome to the gang.

01:33:04.853 --> 01:33:08.922
You ok, mate?
Yeah, right as rain, mate.

01:33:47.649 --> 01:33:49.721
Let's do this fast
and do it right.

01:34:29.526 --> 01:34:29.925
Hey!

01:34:32.219 --> 01:34:33.432
Look out! Look out!

01:34:36.658 --> 01:34:37.323
Get down!

01:34:38.191 --> 01:34:38.664
Here!

01:34:39.818 --> 01:34:42.437
Come on, move up!
Move up, come on, boys!

01:34:44.244 --> 01:34:45.243
Lead on, Kay!

01:34:47.226 --> 01:34:48.469
Keep your heads on Kelly!

01:35:11.277 --> 01:35:12.357
Fuckin' hell!

01:35:15.657 --> 01:35:16.619
Mr. Hall!

01:35:18.204 --> 01:35:19.136
There's 2 more!

01:35:46.489 --> 01:35:48.280
Jesus! Ben,
they're getting closer!

01:35:54.455 --> 01:35:57.621
It's no bloody good,
get back to the horses.

01:35:57.651 --> 01:35:58.775
Come on, Ryan.

01:36:09.533 --> 01:36:11.131
Watch! We've
got them on the run!

01:36:12.985 --> 01:36:14.894
Move up! Move!

01:36:59.702 --> 01:37:00.249
Mr. Hall...

01:37:05.592 --> 01:37:06.761
so where we headed to next?

01:37:08.137 --> 01:37:11.156
We are heading north.
Yeah, that's right,

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:15.299
You are going back to Marinbara.
Excuse me?

01:37:16.499 --> 01:37:20.005
You're going back home,
first thing tomorrow.

01:37:21.515 --> 01:37:22.491
Yeah, like hell I am!

01:37:25.983 --> 01:37:27.714
Look, I don't care what
happened with the escort, alright?

01:37:28.658 --> 01:37:30.271
I said I'd ride with you
and I'm a man of my word.

01:37:32.150 --> 01:37:34.192
Johhnyy Dunn is my good mate,
same as you and Gilbert.

01:37:34.222 --> 01:37:36.352
I don't walk away from mates.
Dan,

01:37:36.737 --> 01:37:37.891
you don't want to
become what we have

01:37:38.352 --> 01:37:40.319
No, I do, that's why I'm here.
That's why I've come here.

01:37:40.911 --> 01:37:41.932
Then, you'll do it your own way.

01:37:46.046 --> 01:37:47.644
I'm not taking any
more mates to hell with me

01:38:25.001 --> 01:38:26.466
We'll cross over the Harvey Ranges here,

01:38:27.383 --> 01:38:29.928
girding around Wellington
on the McCrory River.

01:38:30.509 --> 01:38:35.214
From there, we head east
to the Mirror Valley, then north,

01:38:36.798 --> 01:38:39.121
Straight for Queensland.
That's one hell of a ride.

01:38:39.624 --> 01:38:42.709
If we push hard enough, we can
be across the border in a fortnight.

01:38:44.575 --> 01:38:46.854
From there, we buy our passage out.
With what?

01:38:47.150 --> 01:38:49.813
If we bailed up everyone between here and
Queensland, we still won't have enough.

01:38:50.348 --> 01:38:51.931
No damn way, we're
getting out of the country.

01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.322
I have some stowed away.

01:38:55.319 --> 01:38:56.266
How much?

01:38:57.776 --> 01:38:59.388
Probably not
enough to get us out.

01:39:00.316 --> 01:39:02.817
I don't know, maybe.

01:39:06.264 --> 01:39:10.363
Where is it?
Buried at Mick Coneley's

01:39:11.951 --> 01:39:13.904
You trust Goobang Mick
with that lot?

01:39:15.058 --> 01:39:16.316
He's like family to me

01:39:16.346 --> 01:39:18.130
and he's never once
taken a penny of it.

01:39:18.959 --> 01:39:20.705
We could have been halfway
across the sea by now!

01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:23.161
We nearly got our heads blown off
going after that escort!

01:39:23.191 --> 01:39:25.832
You never wanted
to leave anyway.

01:39:26.172 --> 01:39:28.199
It's you that doesn't
want to leave because you

01:39:28.436 --> 01:39:29.708
can't let Biddy go,

01:39:32.017 --> 01:39:32.594
can you?

01:39:35.409 --> 01:39:38.842
Now, I say it's high time we got
the fuck out of New South Wales.

01:39:40.943 --> 01:39:41.846
Let's go, Johnny.

01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:34.882
You're to be outlawed, Ben,
all three of you.

01:40:35.843 --> 01:40:37.199
First outlaws in the colony.

01:40:38.072 --> 01:40:40.084
This country certainly doesn't
want us anymore, does it.

01:40:40.469 --> 01:40:43.532
Can you blame them?
You raised some hell out there.

01:40:44.523 --> 01:40:46.180
I can't be helpin'
you anymore, Ben.

01:40:46.913 --> 01:40:49.887
Every time you show up,
you put my family at risk.

01:40:51.381 --> 01:40:52.979
I just need your help
one last time, Mick.

01:40:54.267 --> 01:40:56.072
After that, the 3 of us
will be gone forever.

01:40:57.504 --> 01:41:00.449
I swear it.
What do you need?

01:41:29.884 --> 01:41:32.858
Leaving the Colony for good, Mick tells me.
Very soon.

01:41:33.865 --> 01:41:36.217
I'm sorry, you'll be missed.

01:41:38.621 --> 01:41:42.068
By as many as I think?
I'll miss you, for one.

01:41:44.125 --> 01:41:45.279
It's kind of you to say so.

01:41:49.704 --> 01:41:53.803
Do you remember, years ago,
my uncle set your broken leg.

01:41:55.055 --> 01:41:58.162
I remember you lying up there
on our kitchen table, your

01:41:58.709 --> 01:42:02.142
poor leg all wrapped up tight.
How old were you?

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.163
Thirteen?
Fourteen.

01:42:08.854 --> 01:42:09.860
No, not reaaly.

01:42:12.110 --> 01:42:14.596
I fancied you something
terrible in those days.

01:42:15.691 --> 01:42:19.005
Can't imagine how I cried when
I heard you married Biddy Walsh.

01:42:21.239 --> 01:42:23.267
I was convinced
you'd notice me,

01:42:24.148 --> 01:42:25.391
one day, when I'd grown up...

01:42:28.114 --> 01:42:29.549
Wasn't meant to be, I suppose.

01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:32.041
I've always has some other plans,

01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:36.938
Always for the best.

01:42:44.581 --> 01:42:47.540
I wouldn't have broken
your heart the way she did.

01:43:02.289 --> 01:43:03.902
Everything alright?
Yes!

01:43:03.932 --> 01:43:06.299
Just getting a blessed
speck out from his eye.

01:43:07.483 --> 01:43:08.001
Go on...

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:16.438
Thanks for seeing to that.
Quite alright.

01:43:29.929 --> 01:43:31.586
The rest will be waiting
or you when you get back.

01:43:32.178 --> 01:43:33.879
Thank you, Mick.
We won't be too long.

01:43:35.212 --> 01:43:35.863
A week.

01:43:37.130 --> 01:43:37.751
Two, at most.

01:43:53.038 --> 01:43:54.636
I need to ride to Forbes tomorrow.

01:43:55.196 --> 01:43:55.773
What for?

01:43:55.980 --> 01:43:57.874
The boys need me to
pick up some more supplies

01:43:58.170 --> 01:44:01.040
I'll come with you.
No, much faster if I ride alone.

01:44:01.780 --> 01:44:03.195
Let me know if
you need anything.

01:44:21.211 --> 01:44:22.321
Sure you don't want us with you?

01:44:22.898 --> 01:44:25.029
Take care of that bastard, Taylor,
once and for all?

01:44:25.059 --> 01:44:26.050
I'll be fine.

01:44:26.878 --> 01:44:28.669
You heading into Forbes?
You bet.

01:44:29.275 --> 01:44:31.732
I'm not leaving without a goodbye
present from a certain young lady

01:44:32.335 --> 01:44:34.702
Or two.
Stay out of sight.

01:44:36.108 --> 01:44:37.040
Don't draw any attention.

01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:41.474
Be careful, Ben.
We'll be waiting for you at Mick's.

01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.837
You're certain, this man
can be trusted, James?

01:44:49.207 --> 01:44:52.432
Well, not 100%, Sir... but yes.

01:44:53.054 --> 01:44:55.584
Sir, I dealt with these
informer types before.

01:44:55.985 --> 01:44:58.220
Most often, they're planted
by the gang themselves.

01:44:58.545 --> 01:45:01.667
Tryin' to throw us off the scent.
I believe this man is telling the truth.

01:45:01.904 --> 01:45:04.227
I've known him some time, Sir.
Well, who is he?

01:45:05.159 --> 01:45:06.979
He has asked to remain
completely anonymous, Sir.

01:45:08.016 --> 01:45:08.815
I see.

01:45:10.235 --> 01:45:12.188
Sergeant, would you
excuse us, please?

01:45:15.761 --> 01:45:16.294
Sir!

01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:22.400
I'm sorry, Sir, the fewer
people that know, the better.

01:45:23.318 --> 01:45:24.856
Word spreads fast.

01:45:25.768 --> 01:45:28.639
I want you to take out a patrol,
see where this leads...

01:45:29.527 --> 01:45:33.507
If this fellow of yours is lying to us,
we'll soon know and have lost nothing.

01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:39.234
But if he is telling the truth,
this may be our last chance, eh?

01:45:39.485 --> 01:45:40.921
I'll assemble a party immediately.

01:45:41.616 --> 01:45:43.643
I want Sgt. Condell
on this one, as well.

01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:45.360
Sir.

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.648
You may find you need a man
like him on this, James, alright?

01:45:51.772 --> 01:45:52.364
Very well.

01:46:10.455 --> 01:46:10.875
Jim!

01:46:15.737 --> 01:46:17.483
I'll keep him here.
Go! Go!

01:46:25.636 --> 01:46:27.663
Henry, stay close to the house.

01:46:46.998 --> 01:46:47.915
Come to see my boy.

01:46:59.411 --> 01:47:00.092
Hello, Henry.

01:47:00.965 --> 01:47:03.125
Hello.
Do you remember me?

01:47:05.738 --> 01:47:08.239
You're Ben Hall, my Dah.

01:47:10.873 --> 01:47:13.329
That's right, I have something here
that I wanted to give you.

01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:27.534
It's you, not as hairy.

01:47:28.333 --> 01:47:29.117
Thast's right...

01:47:30.478 --> 01:47:31.218
I'm not as hairy.

01:47:32.779 --> 01:47:33.741
I want you to have that,

01:47:34.732 --> 01:47:36.315
so you always remember
who your Daddy is.

01:47:43.863 --> 01:47:46.970
Where's Taylor? I have something
I have to discuss with him...

01:47:48.283 --> 01:47:48.816
Both of you.

01:47:53.328 --> 01:47:53.832
Alright.

01:47:55.755 --> 01:47:57.309
Leave your guns here and
I'll take you to him.

01:48:02.196 --> 01:48:02.714
Biddy!

01:48:06.177 --> 01:48:06.660
Biddy, wait!
What are you...

01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:08.411
He just wants to talk
to you and that's all.

01:48:16.518 --> 01:48:17.687
This is all for Henry,

01:48:19.714 --> 01:48:20.720
300 pounds.

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:23.936
I'm entrusting it
to his mother...

01:48:25.016 --> 01:48:26.836
to be kept safe for
my son's future.

01:48:27.028 --> 01:48:27.916
And nothing else.

01:48:32.008 --> 01:48:36.106
Now, you'll swear an oath, never
to touch a single penny of it, ever.

01:48:39.436 --> 01:48:40.989
I won't touch it, Ben.
I swear!

01:48:47.644 --> 01:48:52.408
Because if you ever steal from
my son, I will hear of it...

01:48:58.696 --> 01:49:00.042
You hold him to that oath, Biddy.

01:49:25.045 --> 01:49:25.622
Where's Ben?

01:49:26.036 --> 01:49:27.915
Went to say farewell to his boy,
out of Lake Hull

01:49:29.076 --> 01:49:30.393
Won't be seeing him
for a few days yet.

01:49:30.630 --> 01:49:31.725
He'll miss you, camped up that way,

01:49:32.317 --> 01:49:35.232
off Mordicent,
wouldn't want anyone to see you here

01:49:35.868 --> 01:49:36.253
Understood.

01:49:40.175 --> 01:49:42.898
Thanks for the grub, Mr. Coneley.
You're welcome.

01:49:50.475 --> 01:49:51.096
Everything alright?

01:49:52.827 --> 01:49:54.440
While we're here,
keep your eyes wide open.

01:50:06.558 --> 01:50:07.505
I have to go away...

01:50:09.857 --> 01:50:11.189
I won't be able
to see you again.

01:50:13.201 --> 01:50:16.116
Not for a very long time.
Promise me...

01:50:17.744 --> 01:50:20.925
when you're grown up,
you'll come and find me.

01:50:22.102 --> 01:50:23.183
I promise.

01:50:27.059 --> 01:50:27.991
I'll be watching out for you.

01:50:35.144 --> 01:50:38.636
You get as far away as you
can, Ben, as fast as you can.

01:50:39.198 --> 01:50:41.314
You don't look back, you
get away safe, you hear?

01:50:41.743 --> 01:50:42.320
Biddy...

01:50:44.767 --> 01:50:47.904
I'm not proud of what I've become.
You have to believe that.

01:50:50.627 --> 01:50:53.142
I just want Henry to know who
his father was before all this.

01:50:56.057 --> 01:50:58.957
Only you can teach him that.
I will.

01:51:00.614 --> 01:51:01.354
Thank you, Biddy.

01:51:12.326 --> 01:51:13.584
I love you, little man.

01:51:36.346 --> 01:51:38.299
Ben! Ben!

01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:52.196
I'm so sorry for what I did.

01:52:43.611 --> 01:52:45.920
Sergeant!
Inspector coming.

01:52:54.641 --> 01:52:57.925
What's the situation?
They've arrived.

01:52:58.724 --> 01:52:59.879
But Gilbert and Dunn only.

01:53:00.263 --> 01:53:02.276
So, let's go take the little bastards.
No.

01:53:02.693 --> 01:53:05.075
We'll wait for Ben Hall.
I mean to take all three.

01:53:05.267 --> 01:53:07.901
If those 2 little bastards are there
now, I say we go get them now.

01:53:07.931 --> 01:53:10.564
Hall will not be far behind.
Sir!

01:53:10.594 --> 01:53:13.169
Do you hear me? We wait!

01:53:36.691 --> 01:53:37.727
Cover the fire, quickly!

01:53:47.389 --> 01:53:49.253
There!
Just who the hell are they?

01:53:49.283 --> 01:53:52.198
I knew it! Conely sold us out,
the fuckin' fistgate!

01:53:56.462 --> 01:53:57.853
What about Ben?
He's on his way here.

01:53:57.897 --> 01:53:59.125
We'll find him first, come on.

01:54:18.830 --> 01:54:19.422
Gilbert!

01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.914
Johnny!

01:54:27.111 --> 01:54:28.353
Gilbert!

01:54:55.539 --> 01:54:58.380
Sergeant, is it true you know Ben Hall?
Hey,

01:54:59.469 --> 01:55:01.748
I escorted him to
his trial in Orange in '62.

01:55:02.488 --> 01:55:03.450
Twasn't long after...

01:55:03.834 --> 01:55:06.261
him and Gardiner and his mates,
they put a little hole in my ribs...

01:55:06.646 --> 01:55:09.635
at Ugaya Rocks.
Damned near killed me that day.

01:55:10.501 --> 01:55:12.499
That Ben Hall fella
nearly killed me too.

01:55:13.401 --> 01:55:15.429
One day at Leselly Creekside there,

01:55:15.932 --> 01:55:17.071
him and other 3 fellas

01:55:17.781 --> 01:55:20.163
they been chase me,
they been shooting at me

01:55:20.831 --> 01:55:23.199
Me have to jump off my horse
up and run

01:55:23.687 --> 01:55:25.596
but that Ben Hall fella
been chase after me

01:55:26.321 --> 01:55:29.961
I had no bullet left; I grab my
gun and I threw it at him...

01:55:31.853 --> 01:55:34.147
and him drop straight on
the ground on him head

01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:40.287
Looks as though we're all acqainted
with the enemy, except myself.

01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:45.595
You will be, sir, soon enough.

01:56:15.074 --> 01:56:18.743
Ben, you're back.
Aye.

01:56:19.883 --> 01:56:22.043
Any trouble about the place?
Not that I've seen.

01:56:23.065 --> 01:56:23.568
All quiet.

01:56:25.684 --> 01:56:27.889
Where are the others?
I've not seen 'em yet.

01:56:28.791 --> 01:56:31.381
Strange, they should
have arrived days ago.

01:56:32.332 --> 01:56:35.291
Hope they're alright,
Why don't you come inside?

01:56:36.076 --> 01:56:37.496
I'll get Mary to cook up
a nice supper.

01:56:38.058 --> 01:56:40.751
I think it's best I make camp.
Alright.

01:56:54.987 --> 01:56:57.280
Gilbert and Dunn are gone.
Gone?

01:56:57.754 --> 01:56:59.100
What do you mean?
Gone where?

01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:01.216
Some Strickland stockmen
passed by yesterday, they

01:57:01.246 --> 01:57:03.125
must have mistaken them
as policemen and bolted.

01:57:03.300 --> 01:57:05.594
Dammit, we should have taken
them when we had the chance.

01:57:05.624 --> 01:57:07.443
But Ben Hall's here.
What?

01:57:07.710 --> 01:57:10.506
Just arrived, not an hour ago.
Camped half a mile from my place.

01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:14.693
We take Hall immediately,
while we still can.

01:57:15.291 --> 01:57:18.694
Davidson, if you ambush
Hall right there, in his camp,

01:57:19.345 --> 01:57:22.305
you shoot him right there
and then, I'm tellin' you.

01:57:22.778 --> 01:57:25.116
If he gets but a yard on you,
you'll lose him.

01:57:25.470 --> 01:57:26.535
You can bet your life on it.

01:57:28.607 --> 01:57:32.246
And then he'll know it was me.
He'll know!

01:57:34.016 --> 01:57:34.667
Shoot him.

01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:07.908
Still no sign of the boys?

01:58:08.974 --> 01:58:10.365
Take a look around
first thing tomorrow.

01:58:11.430 --> 01:58:12.140
Can't be far off.

01:58:17.136 --> 01:58:18.202
See you in the morning, alright?

01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.509
Mick,

01:58:26.571 --> 01:58:26.971
Thank you.

01:58:33.585 --> 01:58:36.145
There! Hall's in that bush somewhere.

01:58:36.455 --> 01:58:37.491
Let's go get him now.

01:58:37.994 --> 01:58:39.844
Not in daylight. He'll
see us coming a mile off.

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.794
Billy! Go ahead.

01:58:44.762 --> 01:58:47.928
Find out exactly where Hall's?
Report straight back.

01:58:48.100 --> 01:58:50.882
Quiet now! No noise, hm?
Good luck.

01:58:53.629 --> 01:58:57.639
Now listen here, Billy. You get close
enough and you shoot that bastard.

01:58:58.373 --> 01:58:59.187
You got that, Boyle?

01:59:01.184 --> 01:59:02.102
You do as your ordered.

01:59:02.466 --> 01:59:03.235
I do what he say.

01:59:04.108 --> 01:59:05.381
What do you think you've
been given this for?

01:59:05.913 --> 01:59:09.257
We're here to kill this man. If you
get the chance, then you shoot him.

01:59:10.524 --> 01:59:11.560
Don't bloody miss.

02:00:21.903 --> 02:00:23.379
Did you find him?
Yes, boss.

02:00:24.252 --> 02:00:26.886
Ben Hall came over in
that trees there. Big bush.

02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:28.055
Hard to be quiet.

02:00:28.869 --> 02:00:31.458
We won't get within 40 yards\
without him hearing us.

02:00:32.606 --> 02:00:35.551
I'm not underestimating this man,
Sergeant, not here!

02:00:36.039 --> 02:00:39.338
This is his world. He knows the
bush like the blacks know the bush.

02:00:40.478 --> 02:00:42.608
Quiet, lads, here's our play.

02:00:43.251 --> 02:00:44.036
Keep this:

02:00:44.391 --> 02:00:46.329
You take Buckley, Coburn,
Bourne and Charlie...

02:00:46.699 --> 02:00:48.016
you circle right
round behind him

02:00:48.371 --> 02:00:49.643
take a position on the lee side,

02:00:49.806 --> 02:00:51.700
now you spread right out
across that flank

02:00:51.730 --> 02:00:52.928
in case he makes a
break for that corner.

02:00:53.564 --> 02:00:56.213
Now, you keep a good distance,
wait there til first light

02:00:56.494 --> 02:00:59.690
Nobody makes a move on him,
fires a single shot,unless I do.

02:01:01.036 --> 02:01:03.936
If we can take him alive, we will.
Let's move!

02:01:05.441 --> 02:01:05.796
I'm up.

02:01:07.320 --> 02:01:11.375
Wait! Boot off,
all of you.

02:01:12.381 --> 02:01:14.171
Sir?
He'll hear us coming a mile off.

02:01:14.828 --> 02:01:15.464
Boots off!

02:01:35.994 --> 02:01:36.571
Ben Hall!

02:04:29.814 --> 02:04:30.569
On my mark.

02:05:10.602 --> 02:05:11.904
Hall!

02:05:18.796 --> 02:05:21.090
Stand fast!

02:05:24.463 --> 02:05:26.712
Hall!

02:05:27.592 --> 02:05:28.465
Shoot him!

02:05:30.063 --> 02:05:31.276
Shoot him now!

02:05:33.141 --> 02:05:35.064
Stand fast!

02:05:52.754 --> 02:05:53.435
Come on!

02:06:39.855 --> 02:06:41.172
No!

02:06:47.945 --> 02:06:50.090
Cease fire!

02:07:15.075 --> 02:07:16.451
Halt!

02:07:19.766 --> 02:07:23.391
No, no, I'm wounded.

02:07:24.456 --> 02:07:25.299
I'm wounded.

02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:45.819
Hold fire!

02:07:46.736 --> 02:07:48.630
Hold fire! No!

02:07:50.489 --> 02:07:54.573
Hold fire!
Cease Fire!

02:10:23.184 --> 02:10:26.025
My God! What happened?
You couldn't take him alive?

02:10:26.528 --> 02:10:27.106
No, Sir.

02:10:28.848 --> 02:10:29.839
Never gave us the chance.

02:10:32.512 --> 02:10:34.288
Well, he must have put
up one hell of a last fight.

02:10:35.886 --> 02:10:37.262
He didn't fire a shot.
What?

02:10:38.963 --> 02:10:42.189
He didn't fire a single shot, Sir.
He was on the run, though, Sir

02:10:42.618 --> 02:10:45.089
And armed... had no choice

02:10:46.776 --> 02:10:49.247
I want a full report from
both of you, immediately!
