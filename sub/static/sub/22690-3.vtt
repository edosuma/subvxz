00:33.866 --> 00:35.452
I get it, Frank.

00:37.329 --> 00:38.580
I get it.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.668
Guys like us, paranoia is second nature.
I get that.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.506
You're wondering if I'm some kind
of a decoy to lure you out.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.176
I'm not. I'm not. It's safe here.

00:52.885 --> 00:55.888
So no need for any of this
Marathon Man stuff.

00:55.972 --> 00:57.890
It's definitely safe, okay?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.459
You don't need to interrogate a man

01:00.518 --> 01:02.437
that's waited months just to talk to you.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.315
Oh, come on.

01:13.906 --> 01:15.075
I get it.

01:15.700 --> 01:19.162
I get it. You wanna...

01:20.455 --> 01:22.749
You're trying to intimidate me.

01:22.832 --> 01:26.961
And I'm not like, uh...
reassuring you, or...

01:28.713 --> 01:29.756
Are you...

01:29.839 --> 01:31.758
You know, you risk botulism doing that.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.261
You always talk this much?

01:35.428 --> 01:36.929
I guess I talk when I'm nervous.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.432
Well, guess you're not as stupid
as you look.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.112
- What is that?
- Shit.

01:54.572 --> 01:55.698
Okay.

01:57.825 --> 01:59.702
Okay, this place is rigged.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.247
What do you mean it's rigged?
What is that?

02:02.330 --> 02:06.042
It means, I don't type a code
into the central terminal, then...

02:07.252 --> 02:08.461
kaboom.

02:09.044 --> 02:12.382
That alarm means we got three minutes
before it gets awful warm in here.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.179
- Ah, no. That's bullshit.
- Do I look like I'm lying to you?

02:17.262 --> 02:20.014
- You really wanna take that risk?
- What's the password?

02:20.097 --> 02:21.766
Only takes a retinal scan.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.249
What? You really wanna die together?

02:31.108 --> 02:32.319
Come on!

03:50.855 --> 03:52.106
Come on!

03:53.358 --> 03:57.028
Ninety seconds. We're both gonna die
feeling pretty stupid here, you know that?

03:58.946 --> 04:00.072
Oh, you...

04:03.285 --> 04:04.494
Come on!

04:05.828 --> 04:08.056
- I'm gonna say it one time...
- Are you gonna help me out?

04:08.080 --> 04:09.624
- Oh, yeah. No bullshit.
- Yeah?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.376
I'm warning you.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.887
I forgot it was... I forgot it was there!

04:22.970 --> 04:25.723
- What is that? What is that?
- I forgot it was there!

04:37.860 --> 04:40.780
- Nice and easy, Lieberman.
- Okay...

04:47.287 --> 04:48.663
Hey, what are you doing?

04:48.746 --> 04:50.832
- What are you doing?
- Retinal scan.

04:52.249 --> 04:53.250
Go on.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.011
- Disable it.
- I can't! It's hardwired.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.764
Piece of shit.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.480
All right.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.316
Oh, are we still doing this?
Come on.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.026
Yup.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.571
We are most definitely still doing this.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.077
You're an idiot.
You don't know a goddamn thing.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.162
The same people that killed you,
killed me.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.164
Is that right?

05:32.248 --> 05:34.626
Start talking.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.420
You know, I got an idea, man.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.882
Why don't you get me some pants?

05:40.965 --> 05:43.385
Yeah. I could make us some tea.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.345
We could do this like...

05:52.394 --> 05:54.061
Yeah. Does that hurt?

05:54.145 --> 05:56.564
Oh, yeah. I get it.

05:57.940 --> 05:59.942
That's just stimuli.
You're reacting to it.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.319
You get used to that.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.322
Pain. You can get used to pain, Lieberman.
You can adjust to it.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.450
You can adjust to pretty much anything.

06:07.533 --> 06:10.161
Just as long as there's routine, right?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.956
Routine. Human mind, it craves it.
Needs it.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.958
But if you take that away, that...

06:17.669 --> 06:19.837
That's when you start to lose your shit.

06:21.047 --> 06:25.217
When you take away day
and night and food.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.219
No water, no patterns.

06:30.347 --> 06:33.810
You know what's crazy, Lieberman?
Even though you know what's happening...

06:33.893 --> 06:37.104
I'm telling you that it's happening...
Even though you know it...

06:37.188 --> 06:39.398
rationalizing it won't do shit.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.903
People think that torture is pain.
It's not pain.

06:45.613 --> 06:46.906
It's time.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.786
It's time to slowly realize
that your life, it's over.

06:51.869 --> 06:55.457
It's over, Lieberman.
Now all you got is the nightmare.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.961
You and me, we got time.

07:05.007 --> 07:10.930
I was a, uh... NSA analyst.

07:14.183 --> 07:18.646
I was working on Afghanistan intelligence,
which, uh...

07:19.564 --> 07:22.442
Maybe you know it's just an oxymoron
because, uh...

07:24.527 --> 07:29.323
our basic tactic is to pay anyone
we can to tell tales.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.783
You know?

07:31.701 --> 07:35.079
"Hey, kid. Tell me a story,
I'll give you some money."

07:36.038 --> 07:38.791
So they did, you know?

07:39.709 --> 07:44.589
And, uh... my job was to, uh...

07:46.716 --> 07:49.927
assess this shit pile

07:50.011 --> 07:53.347
for, uh, actionable intelligence.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.562
It was a monumental waste of my time.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.984
Till one day, uh...

08:07.319 --> 08:09.405
they sent me something interesting.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.574
I just don't understand.
What is that disk?

08:11.658 --> 08:13.242
Why did they send it to you?

08:13.325 --> 08:15.220
I'm the analyst.
That's what they're meant to do.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.163
They send me actual, real intelligence

08:17.246 --> 08:20.833
and then I, you know, I assess it
and decide how to deal with it.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.795
It's actually... I could do my job
for the first time in five years.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.297
But you should...
You should give it to your section chief.

08:26.380 --> 08:29.217
Pass it up the line of command
so it's not on you.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.802
If he buries it? What then?

08:30.885 --> 08:34.179
- Then that's on them.
- Mom, did you get juice?

08:35.640 --> 08:38.308
Yeah, honey.
Yeah, come in here. I'll get you some.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.645
If you go around the chain of command,

08:41.729 --> 08:43.731
neither of us is naive
about what it could mean.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.778
- Should I get a cup?
- Yeah, yeah, get a cup.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.323
- Hey, Leo, you want some juice, honey?
- Yes, please.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.452
All right, you guys,
get into your pj's. Time for bed.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.736
I finished my homework.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.583
Oh, your father will look at it
before you go to sleep.

09:03.710 --> 09:06.045
- All right.
- Thanks.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.755
- Go. Go.
- Thank you.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.192
- To bed.
- Love you. Good night.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.359
- Love you.
- Good night.

09:11.383 --> 09:12.885
- Good night.
- Good night, baby.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.311
- I really wanna do the right thing here.
- Mmm-hmm.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.606
You want me to tell you it's okay

09:24.689 --> 09:28.525
so that if this all blows up,
it won't be your fault.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.613
David, I just...

09:33.364 --> 09:34.699
I can't do that.

09:38.410 --> 09:42.039
You know, everything that we teach them
about being good human beings...

09:43.374 --> 09:45.126
that's what this comes down to.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.587
This is why I took this job.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.714
This is why we are here and I'm not...

09:50.339 --> 09:53.259
writing apps in Silicon Valley.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.263
How am I supposed to look
these guys in the eye,

09:57.346 --> 09:59.932
knowing that I didn't have the guts
to do the right thing?

10:03.811 --> 10:06.313
Look, hey... hey.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.358
Come here.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.361
Mmm.

10:15.406 --> 10:19.326
You do... what you think you should.

10:24.331 --> 10:25.416
Hmm.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.102
Your turn, Dad! Dad?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.062
David.

11:29.563 --> 11:33.109
Oh, sorry, you guys. Um...

11:33.192 --> 11:35.737
- Is it a quadruped?
- What's a...

11:35.820 --> 11:37.905
- Four-legged animal. A quadruped.
- You know that.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.198
Sorry. Uh, yes.

11:39.281 --> 11:43.577
Okay, so we got
a non-jungle-dwelling quadruped.

11:43.660 --> 11:45.138
- Vegetarian.
- Four-legged vegetarian animal

11:45.162 --> 11:47.373
that does not live in the jungle.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.666
- And...
- This is painful.

11:49.751 --> 11:51.252
- Are we gonna be late?
- No.

11:51.335 --> 11:55.131
No. No, no, no.
We should be fine, you guys. I think.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.508
Everyone has the same idea we do.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.551
I wanna make it there in time.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.473
Make it to that haunted house,
before the line.

12:04.556 --> 12:06.267
- Stay in the car.
- What?

12:06.350 --> 12:09.603
- No matter what happens.
- What are you doing? Babe?

12:09.686 --> 12:11.730
- Dad? Dad?
- What are you doing?

12:11.814 --> 12:13.374
- What are you doing?
- Stay in the car.

12:13.440 --> 12:14.608
Understand? Stay in the car.

12:14.691 --> 12:16.819
- Stay in the car. I'll be right back.
- Dad?

12:16.903 --> 12:18.029
David!

12:44.806 --> 12:45.806
Don't move!

12:47.892 --> 12:52.354
- Lieberman, get on the ground! Now!
- Look, this is a mistake, all right?

12:52.438 --> 12:55.983
Whatever your orders, I'm not a criminal.
I'm an NSA analyst.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.401
Get down!

12:57.484 --> 12:59.862
- I'm an NSA analyst!
- He's got a weapon!

12:59.946 --> 13:01.655
No, I don't. No, no, no, no, no!

13:01.738 --> 13:03.449
- That's not true!
- David?

13:03.532 --> 13:05.532
This is a mistake, okay?
This is a mistake.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.453
Sarah, go.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.121
- David!
- Drop the weapon!

13:09.205 --> 13:10.723
- Sarah!
- On your knees!

13:10.747 --> 13:12.249
- No, no, no.
- David!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.877
No, no, no! Sarah, go!

13:14.961 --> 13:16.879
- David!
- Go, go, go, go!

13:16.963 --> 13:18.089
No!

13:18.172 --> 13:20.424
No!

13:20.507 --> 13:24.261
No! No!

13:24.887 --> 13:26.555
Cell phone saved my life.

13:33.770 --> 13:35.356
I went underground.

13:36.857 --> 13:39.276
They, uh, rewrote the narrative.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.196
Planted evidence, painted me as a traitor.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.948
Picked my life apart.

13:46.158 --> 13:49.286
Made life hell for Sarah. For our kids.

13:50.787 --> 13:52.748
You know, she said you were brave.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.043
- Hmm.
- Brave and stupid.

13:57.503 --> 14:00.589
And here I am, tied butt naked to a chair.
So, uh...

14:05.219 --> 14:06.345
Yeah.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.269
Are we still doing this?

14:14.395 --> 14:15.521
Yeah.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.859
Could I at least have a glass of water?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.322
Autopsy report.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.700
- Unless Wolf shot himself in the leg...
- Hmm.

14:28.784 --> 14:32.579
...busted his own face
and broke his own neck,

14:32.663 --> 14:35.041
I think it's fair to say
that we're looking at murder here.

14:35.124 --> 14:37.960
- God.
- Well, torture, then murder, to be exact.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.506
I think the killer came down the chimney.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.051
Motion detectors never picked him up.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.720
Wolf comes home, turns off the alarm
and bam! The guy hits him.

14:48.804 --> 14:52.558
So we're looking for Bad Santa?

14:54.768 --> 14:56.645
The press knows he's dead.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.275
No statements. Not yet.

15:03.652 --> 15:06.072
This is going to be
a jurisdictional cockfight.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.908
NYPD and FBI?

15:08.991 --> 15:11.118
They're both already trying
to jump onboard.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.495
Screw 'em.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.289
He was one of us.

15:36.102 --> 15:39.396
Why you gotta be so quiet?
Like a damn cat.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.483
I could tie a bell around my neck
or something, if that'd help you out.

15:42.899 --> 15:45.319
Yeah, you do that.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.865
- Want some coffee? It's fresh-brewed.
- Sure.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.620
So, what brings you down here?

15:57.999 --> 15:59.625
Personal delivery.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.669
Thank you.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.839
I'm honored, Mr. Russo, sir.

16:06.507 --> 16:09.010
Kiss my ass, Curtis.

16:11.803 --> 16:15.141
So, uh... how's it all going here, anyway?

16:16.308 --> 16:20.562
Ah, you know, it's good.
Your money pays the rent.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.190
Keeps the homeless guys
in coffee and soup.

16:23.815 --> 16:25.985
And occasionally,
we talk about being a vet.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.114
It helps.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.865
Some of them, I think.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.618
They keep coming back
so that must mean something, right?

16:34.701 --> 16:37.329
You always were good
at putting people back together.

16:37.413 --> 16:39.706
You should stay.
See what you're paying for.

16:41.375 --> 16:45.837
- Yeah. Yeah, I don't need that.
- Which is why you should stay.

16:47.131 --> 16:51.010
It'd be good for these guys to see
someone like them who made a second life.

16:53.762 --> 16:57.974
I'd feel guilty that I got out in time.

16:59.351 --> 17:02.146
These guys, they...
they got problems that I don't.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.441
I'm way too selfish to do what you do.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.568
There's nothing selfish about this.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.654
It means a lot.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.578
- So how's business?
- Pretty good, actually. As you ask.

17:18.494 --> 17:19.663
A mover and a shaker.

17:19.746 --> 17:22.415
A man of wealth and taste.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.588
You always knew you were destined
to do greater things, I'll give you that.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.343
What?

17:32.426 --> 17:35.929
I just... I can't tell if you think
that's a good thing or not.

17:36.013 --> 17:40.184
No, I... I'm proud of you. I really am.

17:42.186 --> 17:45.106
You know there's always a job
for you at Anvil.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.940
Instructor's job.

17:47.023 --> 17:49.151
You're still the best corpsman I ever saw.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.197
Hell, I bet you'd have stitched
your own damn leg back on, given a chance.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.407
Hell, yeah.
If you could find it.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.911
But is that why you're here?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.627
We still good for tomorrow night?

18:08.420 --> 18:09.463
Yeah.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.635
Yeah, I'll be there.

18:15.719 --> 18:16.720
Good.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.559
You should come work with me, Curtis.

18:26.021 --> 18:27.439
You know I'd look after you.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.525
Yeah, I'm sure.

18:30.942 --> 18:34.946
But I got out in time, too.
Even if it did cost me a leg.

18:36.198 --> 18:38.242
I ain't got no plans on going back.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.288
Guess that makes us the lucky ones.

19:34.548 --> 19:37.008
Who's coming, Lieberman, huh?

19:37.092 --> 19:38.885
I know someone's coming.
Tell me who it is.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.847
- No, no, no, someone's coming.
- Nobody's coming.

19:41.930 --> 19:44.683
- I don't believe you survived on your own.
- Yeah?

19:44.766 --> 19:45.892
Tell me who it is.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.936
I survived for the same reason
that you survived.

19:48.019 --> 19:49.730
'Cause I'm good at this stuff.

19:51.147 --> 19:55.694
I know that it makes it easier for you
if you make me the enemy, but I'm not.

19:55.777 --> 19:56.820
Hey...

19:57.654 --> 19:59.573
I'm the only friend you have, Frank.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.659
Hey!

20:04.286 --> 20:06.372
I'm the only friend you have, Frank.

20:08.957 --> 20:10.125
Hey!

20:15.088 --> 20:17.257
If somebody was coming, who would it be?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.889
Success here
is a matter of perspective.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.309
It can't be measured
in battles won or land claimed.

20:28.394 --> 20:31.146
Gentlemen, I'm here to offer you freedom.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.650
To wage the war that must be waged
to finally win this thing.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.319
What we will do is dirty and tough,

20:37.403 --> 20:41.532
but it will speed an end of this war
and safeguard our nation.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.409
Major Schoonover.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.790
You were all handpicked
'cause you're the best at what you do.

20:50.957 --> 20:53.294
Inter-unit rivalry has no place here.

20:54.503 --> 20:58.715
Berets, Delta, SEALs, Force Recon...
I don't give a shit.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.343
This is who we are now.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.305
This is Operation Cerberus...

21:05.389 --> 21:06.973
and you are my dogs of war.

21:09.560 --> 21:13.146
The enemy operates
without regard to honor or rules.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.399
So neither will we.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.318
Our mission is simple.

21:17.401 --> 21:21.029
We capture, interrogate
and execute high-value targets.

21:21.112 --> 21:22.698
Sounds like the Phoenix Program.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.575
Do we have a problem with that, gentlemen?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.160
Not if Congress doesn't.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.538
They're fine with it.

21:30.247 --> 21:34.501
I'm the only authority you will need.
I point, you shoot.

21:36.878 --> 21:40.173
Castle and Russo are team leaders.
They'll post all assignments.

21:41.342 --> 21:42.343
Any questions?

21:43.594 --> 21:47.889
Sir... does this mean
that Ann-Margret's not coming?

21:49.516 --> 21:50.517
I mean...

21:51.435 --> 21:53.562
Jackass...

22:04.448 --> 22:06.199
Play any Kenny Rogers on that thing?

22:06.282 --> 22:09.745
Well, it's, uh...
it's not really my speed.

22:10.454 --> 22:11.455
Gunner Henderson.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.457
You're leading my team.
I've heard good things.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.460
Yeah, likewise.
Jack Kimber, he's a friend.

22:16.543 --> 22:18.253
He calls you the best breacher
he ever saw.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.381
I'm excited to watch you work.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.641
All here to serve the Lord's will,
my friend.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.218
Hmm. Fair enough.

22:25.301 --> 22:28.889
We're the sword of the righteous.
Our aim must be true.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.349
"Righteousness keepeth him that is upright
in the way,

22:31.933 --> 22:35.396
but wickedness overthroweth the sinner."
It's Proverbs 13:6.

22:38.857 --> 22:39.900
Okay.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.031
Your face. I'm messing with you, boss.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.910
- All right, man. Nice to meet you.
- All right, man. You, too.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.872
- He seems fun.
- Oh, yeah.

22:58.209 --> 23:01.046
How's, uh... how's your team look?

23:04.090 --> 23:05.216
Ready for bear.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.097
Hey, you notice that our fearless leader
didn't even give us a name?

23:11.181 --> 23:12.433
Yeah.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.935
Heard some of the guys
call him Agent Orange.

23:17.395 --> 23:19.690
- I like that.
- Do you?

23:21.900 --> 23:22.943
What, you don't trust him?

23:25.487 --> 23:28.281
Ours is not to reason why, Frankie boy.

23:29.908 --> 23:31.660
Ours is but to do or die.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.620
That's from a poem about a bunch of guys

23:33.704 --> 23:37.082
who got their asses handed to 'em
on the back of bad intel, right?

23:38.208 --> 23:40.752
- You are shitting me.
- Shit you not.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.798
You read a poem?

23:44.881 --> 23:46.800
Billy, you're so funny, man.

23:46.883 --> 23:50.512
- Seriously, it's hilarious.
- Hey, you never cease to amaze me, man.

23:50.596 --> 23:53.181
All by yourself?
I didn't know you could read.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.934
Sorry about that.

23:57.143 --> 24:01.397
I once took out
a machine gun nest,

24:01.482 --> 24:03.609
saw this guy's head explode and...

24:04.610 --> 24:07.237
all I thought was, "Good shot."

24:09.447 --> 24:14.661
I hated the enemy 'cause I had to, but...
but I respected him, too.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.872
They don't haunt me.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.504
One of our Apaches hit some of our own.

24:24.838 --> 24:26.548
Friendly fire.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.050
There is no such thing.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.596
But it's war, right? Shit happens.

24:33.889 --> 24:37.601
Except I then saw some press officer
pass it off to reporters

24:37.684 --> 24:40.395
as an enemy ambush.

24:40.478 --> 24:41.897
Lying pricks.

24:43.189 --> 24:46.484
All I could think was
that it dishonored those men as soldiers.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.237
They were good at their jobs.

24:49.738 --> 24:53.199
They didn't get ambushed like assholes.
It was a lie.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.244
When, um...

24:57.370 --> 24:59.540
I dream, I see that guy.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.087
And it... It's me that he is lying about.

25:07.672 --> 25:11.384
Me that he is turning into an asshole.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.303
Like it all meant nothing.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.895
What do you do
when you can't trust your own?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.939
Take matters into your own hands.

25:24.022 --> 25:28.068
- Oh, here we go.
- No, no, no, no. I agree with O'Connor.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.612
First time for everything, right?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.573
About time you saw sense.

25:32.656 --> 25:34.575
We take matters
into our own hands.

25:34.658 --> 25:38.954
We are not the only soldiers
to feel let down by the country we serve.

25:39.329 --> 25:42.999
I have friends who have been betrayed
in ways that you guys can't even imagine.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.043
Everything taken from them.

25:49.339 --> 25:53.218
A good man risked his life to save mine.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.472
Yeah.

25:57.556 --> 26:00.392
And I decided not to throw away
that gift he gave me.

26:01.517 --> 26:04.938
So I got a job... started my second life.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.734
And now I take pride
in living that life well.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.236
What the hell is it
that you do anyways, Curtis?

26:11.820 --> 26:12.988
I sell insurance.

26:15.448 --> 26:18.034
It's a hell of a sales tool.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.704
All right, let's wrap it up, guys.

26:29.755 --> 26:33.216
Read this, kid.
You're right to feel betrayed.

26:33.299 --> 26:36.094
And there's plenty men
who feel just the same.

26:36.177 --> 26:38.930
This touchy-feely bullshit
ain't gonna solve nothing.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.983
You gotta spin me around
so I can enter the code.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.127
Here's the thing.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.069
There are no explosive devices
in this place.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.363
If there were, I would have found 'em.

26:55.446 --> 26:58.950
So, you keep saying, "Believe me,"
but you keep lying to me, Lieberman.

26:59.034 --> 27:03.038
Bravo, Frank, you got it.
No explosives.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.748
No fire.

27:04.831 --> 27:06.875
Spin me around. Let me show you something.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.046
Spin me around! Come on!

27:26.186 --> 27:28.313
Smile, Frank, you're on Candid Camera.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.989
You see, if I don't enter a code,

27:38.073 --> 27:40.826
then all these video feeds,
they get sent to various media outlets

27:40.909 --> 27:42.493
and the world knows you're still alive.

27:42.577 --> 27:45.914
You want that? No? Let me go.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.624
Let me go.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.172
Figured if they ever found me here...

27:55.340 --> 27:57.926
at least I could broadcast my murder
to the world.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.720
Let my family know
I wasn't what everyone said.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.854
I would have lost my last chance
of going home and seeing 'em.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.940
This chance. Us.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.860
My family... they're gone.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.278
They're gone because of your goddamn disk.
What about that?

28:17.362 --> 28:18.989
Had nothing to do
with what you did, huh?

28:19.072 --> 28:20.949
Hey, you shut your mouth.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.408
- Yeah?
- You shut your mouth.

28:22.492 --> 28:26.079
You followed orders, I did my job.
You tell me what's the difference...

28:26.162 --> 28:27.497
- There's a difference...
- Yeah?

28:27.580 --> 28:28.820
- Yeah.
- What's the difference?

28:28.874 --> 28:30.792
What's the difference?
Let me ask you something.

28:30.876 --> 28:33.003
- How many times was Zubair beaten?
- Shut your mouth.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.546
How many times was
this innocent man tortured?

28:35.630 --> 28:39.175
He was a good man!
He was an honorable father. He was a cop.

28:39.259 --> 28:40.260
Hey!

28:43.096 --> 28:45.766
- Are you gonna kill me?
- The thought does cross my mind.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.409
- It's crossing my mind.
- You're not gonna kill me.

28:47.433 --> 28:50.771
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I know people. I'm an analyst.

28:50.854 --> 28:52.063
It's my job.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.066
You're not gonna kill me
'cause you're a good man.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.609
You...

28:58.904 --> 29:02.490
You don't know shit. You don't know shit.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.960
Who else knows?

29:21.134 --> 29:22.177
Who else knows?

29:26.055 --> 29:28.391
There is still time for you to undo this.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.019
I will help you.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.814
You answer the question.

29:38.359 --> 29:41.822
Do all these men know
I am a police officer?

29:43.281 --> 29:45.366
Are they all part of this?

29:45.951 --> 29:48.578
- What's he saying?
- Nothing useful.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.122
We sure he's even got anything?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.208
Are you questioning my intelligence,
soldier?

29:54.375 --> 29:58.296
Please, I'm not a terrorist.
I have a family, children...

30:01.216 --> 30:02.717
I am a good man.

30:03.426 --> 30:06.930
If you want your family
to see another sunrise...

30:07.514 --> 30:10.558
you will stop talking. You understand me?

30:14.479 --> 30:16.523
If you don't know anything...

30:21.361 --> 30:22.821
Do it.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.907
Please... I'm not a terrorist.

30:25.991 --> 30:29.327
I have a family. I... I have a family.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.894
What are you doing?

30:55.603 --> 30:57.605
We desecrating corpses now?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.316
Frank?

31:03.778 --> 31:08.283
Schoonover said get the bullet.
I'm getting the bullet.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.326
Looks to me like we're hiding evidence.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.454
You good with that?

31:14.289 --> 31:17.918
No one's asking for our opinions.
Not while we're here.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.046
Let's go.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.444
Happy birthday, Frank.

31:46.612 --> 31:49.657
It's a good thing you did...
getting a stone.

31:50.825 --> 31:55.413
Yeah. Figured he deserved
a marker of some kind, right?

32:00.251 --> 32:05.006
Frank would have hated this,
this maudlin shit.

32:08.759 --> 32:09.970
I wish he'd...

32:14.140 --> 32:16.767
Why didn't...
Why didn't he come to us, man?

32:19.104 --> 32:20.855
After Maria and the kids?

32:22.523 --> 32:24.501
Why didn't he come to us?
He didn't have to be alone.

32:24.525 --> 32:25.735
We could've helped him.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.821
Yeah, he didn't want any help.

32:28.904 --> 32:31.574
He wanted to kill every bastard
who had a hand in it.

32:36.204 --> 32:37.455
I miss him.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.043
And I could see it.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.255
I could see it.

32:46.672 --> 32:49.800
Even before... what happened.

32:51.302 --> 32:52.220
He was changing.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.680
He was finding it
harder and harder to come back.

32:56.766 --> 33:00.103
He said Kandahar was like nothing else.

33:01.937 --> 33:03.773
He said the lines were blurred.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.318
When did he say that?

33:11.697 --> 33:13.866
Uh, just when he was over there.

33:15.701 --> 33:18.288
He called me, you know, to shoot the shit.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.457
Said I was lucky not to be there.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.169
Yeah.

33:25.170 --> 33:26.296
Well...

33:27.672 --> 33:28.923
you were.

33:39.100 --> 33:40.226
Oh.

33:41.519 --> 33:44.480
Yeah, he did not die easy.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.775
You feel guilty for disliking this man.

33:49.777 --> 33:53.114
I wanted him out of my way, Mom,
but not like this.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.241
And now you get to sit in his chair.

33:56.451 --> 33:57.660
Temporarily.

33:57.743 --> 34:00.538
Someone has to become the agent in charge.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.498
Why not you?

34:03.124 --> 34:05.710
- I'm not sure I'm suited to command.
- Really?

34:05.793 --> 34:09.922
You went to Afghanistan
because it was a fast track to promotion.

34:10.005 --> 34:12.507
"A notch on your belt"
was the phrase you used

34:12.592 --> 34:14.260
when I tried to talk you out of it.

34:14.344 --> 34:15.928
Well, my priorities changed.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.809
With the death of your friend.

34:22.601 --> 34:27.190
And now you're closing yourself off,
find it hard to trust people.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.818
But this withdrawal
is not a good thing, Dinah.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.114
Don't make me the victim of this, Mom.
I'm not.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.532
You want a victim, look at Wolf or Ahmad.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.201
And I'm not withdrawing.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.161
Truth is, I just don't trust anyone else
to get it right.

34:41.246 --> 34:43.873
You want to label me something,
then call it arrogance.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.376
I'm the best. Others will let me down.

34:46.458 --> 34:48.503
Of course they will, darling.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.714
C'est la vie. That's life.

34:51.797 --> 34:56.219
How we deal with disappointments
is what decides the person we are.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.902
Yeah, but I'm not talking about someone
turning up late for dinner

34:58.971 --> 35:00.306
or buying the wrong flowers.

35:00.390 --> 35:02.933
You know what? You are arrogant.

35:03.017 --> 35:06.146
And more than a little self-important.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.482
But you will have to trust someone,
sometime.

35:10.941 --> 35:13.944
Though I wonder if it isn't
the other way around.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.988
After what happened with your friend,

35:16.072 --> 35:19.200
perhaps you are terrified
someone will choose to trust you.

35:22.787 --> 35:23.788
Hmm?

35:27.750 --> 35:29.377
- Hey, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.878
Hi.

35:40.888 --> 35:41.931
No!

35:53.984 --> 35:57.530
Happy birthday, Frank.
It's the 15th.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.490
Happy birthday.

36:02.910 --> 36:04.787
I know all there is to know.

36:05.705 --> 36:06.747
- Yeah.
- Hey.

36:07.623 --> 36:10.376
If you cut me loose, I'll buy you a cake.

36:12.337 --> 36:16.341
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

36:16.924 --> 36:19.427
You know, sooner or later
you're gonna have to, uh,

36:19.510 --> 36:22.305
get me something to drink or eat.

36:23.764 --> 36:24.890
Or kill me.

36:27.685 --> 36:29.270
What's it gonna be?

36:33.149 --> 36:34.817
Mmm.

36:42.575 --> 36:45.036
You never should have come after me,
Lieberman.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.288
I didn't have a choice.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.166
They took our families from us.

36:50.249 --> 36:53.669
Jesus. That's such bullshit.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.964
Your family's alive. Mine's gone.

36:57.923 --> 36:59.509
You threw yours away.

37:02.762 --> 37:05.640
You had a choice. I didn't.

37:05.723 --> 37:09.477
Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.
Maybe someday you're gonna believe it.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.812
You and I both thought
we were serving our country.

37:11.896 --> 37:14.064
- We both thought that.
- Type the code.

37:14.148 --> 37:16.776
And now if I go home,
I get my family killed.

37:16.859 --> 37:19.654
You know, you and I together,
we could change that.

37:21.071 --> 37:22.240
Type the code.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.827
I'm sorry, Frank.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.479
Lewis? You down there, son?

38:39.442 --> 38:40.610
You down here?

38:48.701 --> 38:49.702
Dad...

38:50.995 --> 38:51.996
Son...

38:55.082 --> 38:58.127
- Shit.
- Come here.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.963
Oh, God.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.091
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

39:04.174 --> 39:05.968
- What?
- I could have killed you.

39:06.051 --> 39:08.679
No, no. You didn't. Nobody got hurt.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.393
- Dad, I could have killed you.
- You're okay. I'm okay.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.437
No, I could have killed you, Dad.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.333
Pulled Wolf's bank records.

39:49.845 --> 39:50.888
Thirty million?

39:51.389 --> 39:54.684
Yep. Six accounts. All buried offshore.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.853
- Any indication where it's from?
- Still working on that.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.316
We have to run this up the flagpole,
Dinah.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.359
As far as you're concerned,
I am the flagpole.

40:04.444 --> 40:05.820
Who else can we trust with this?

40:05.903 --> 40:09.156
I'm new here, you brought me the evidence.
Everyone else is suspect.

40:09.239 --> 40:10.950
And you don't find that kinda scary?

40:14.119 --> 40:16.497
No. Of course not.

40:17.582 --> 40:19.291
Puts you right where you want to be.

40:21.210 --> 40:22.336
And where is that, exactly?

40:23.421 --> 40:27.091
On your own.
Riding cowboy. You against the world.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.510
You speak to Wolf like this
when he was your boss?

40:31.262 --> 40:32.763
That's what I get?

40:34.389 --> 40:37.392
You know, you came in here
with a bug up your ass

40:37.477 --> 40:40.395
about a case nobody wanted
and all this "we're not partners" stuff,

40:40.480 --> 40:43.398
- but now you want me to keep your secrets?
- Yeah.

40:47.027 --> 40:50.865
You know...
you were right about one thing.

40:51.449 --> 40:55.410
Trust, loyalty... you gotta earn those.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.416
Stein. Sam.

41:02.417 --> 41:03.418
Wait.

41:16.306 --> 41:17.975
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:19.769 --> 41:22.104
Easy now, Frank.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.816
Hey, don't do that. I wouldn't do that.
I wouldn't... No swift move...

41:30.988 --> 41:32.281
Why don't you sit down?

41:33.365 --> 41:35.034
Have a cup of coffee. Come on.

41:40.289 --> 41:41.456
Time to choose.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.714
- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, my God, man.

41:49.632 --> 41:51.551
You didn't listen to anything that I said?

41:53.719 --> 41:56.055
Oh, my God.
You gotta be the most stubborn...

41:56.138 --> 41:58.891
Why didn't I kill you? Jesus.

41:58.974 --> 42:01.560
- The codes.
- Turned that off.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.606
You know, it's like you said.
Routines, right? Patterns.

42:05.690 --> 42:06.982
Jesus Christ.

42:07.066 --> 42:10.945
They lull us into a sense of,
uh, normality, a false sense of security.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.822
We cease to question.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.032
- Even somebody like you.
- You're an asshole.

42:16.659 --> 42:20.913
You know, these men that, uh,
tried to kill us, they have patterns.

42:22.289 --> 42:25.668
Patterns that don't, uh,
involve you and me.

42:28.921 --> 42:31.048
- I mean, they think we're dead.
- Lieberman...

42:32.007 --> 42:33.884
I don't do partners.

42:34.176 --> 42:35.302
Get over yourself.

42:35.385 --> 42:37.722
There's no place for emotion here,
you know?

42:39.389 --> 42:42.059
You and me have both done things
that we would like to take back.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.142
We can't.

42:43.894 --> 42:47.106
But we're not the bad guys here, they are.
Right?

42:52.069 --> 42:54.822
Yeah.

43:03.831 --> 43:04.957
Shut up.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.630
Oh, I love my wife. I love my wife.

43:11.505 --> 43:12.840
What'd you get?

43:12.923 --> 43:15.593
Springsteen. Playing the Meadowlands.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.178
Lady got me tickets for when I get back.
Huh? Right?

43:18.262 --> 43:19.304
Nice.

43:20.723 --> 43:24.476
- Yo, 29 days and counting, man.
- That's right. You bet your ass.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.438
What about you, Bill?

43:30.357 --> 43:31.441
You got plans?

43:34.945 --> 43:36.739
Yeah, yeah. I got some plans.

43:36.822 --> 43:41.786
Billy the Beaut, huh?
Some things don't change.

43:41.869 --> 43:45.164
You ever think about,
maybe, quality over quantity?

43:45.247 --> 43:47.708
Pick a winner. Settle down.

43:47.792 --> 43:50.044
God made me this way for a reason, bro.

43:50.127 --> 43:52.254
It'd be wrong
not to share the wealth,

43:52.337 --> 43:54.589
- you know what I'm saying?
- "Share the wealth."

43:54.674 --> 43:56.359
- You know what we should do?
- What's that?

43:56.383 --> 43:57.384
Know what we should do?

43:57.467 --> 43:59.845
Frank's gonna head home
and read his kids a bedtime story.

43:59.929 --> 44:01.096
At ease.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.307
Need you gentlemen for a briefing.
Five minutes.

44:03.390 --> 44:04.642
Sir.

44:12.566 --> 44:14.109
This terrain means...

44:14.443 --> 44:16.153
we won't be able to land
near the compound

44:16.236 --> 44:18.739
without alerting the enemy,
so we're gonna land here,

44:18.823 --> 44:21.366
north of this ridge. Move in on foot.

44:21.450 --> 44:24.494
Once both teams are in position,
we'll hit the compound.

44:24.578 --> 44:25.705
No air support?

44:26.288 --> 44:28.248
This is a clandestine mission,
Lieutenant Russo.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.042
Air support would negate that.

44:30.125 --> 44:32.127
You got something to add, Castle?

44:33.128 --> 44:34.672
Sir, this looks like an ambush.

44:34.755 --> 44:38.508
And what do you base
that sound factual analysis on, Castle?

44:38.592 --> 44:41.636
This man has been a target for months.
His whereabouts are finally confirmed.

44:41.721 --> 44:43.241
We're not gonna get this chance again.

44:43.305 --> 44:45.725
So what now? He's just here? He's...

44:45.808 --> 44:48.128
He's just waiting to be caught
where there's no easy exfil?

44:48.185 --> 44:50.145
Where the terrain makes it a death trap?

44:50.229 --> 44:52.898
You got any idea
what they call teams like ours?

44:52.982 --> 44:54.334
They call us the American Taliban.

44:54.358 --> 44:57.152
Because we go in, the middle of the night,
people disappear.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.154
We have been doing it for a year,
all right?

45:01.490 --> 45:03.826
Now, look, they know about us.
They want us dead.

45:04.534 --> 45:05.535
I think this is a trap.

45:05.619 --> 45:08.080
I think it's a trap
because it's exactly what I would do.

45:11.625 --> 45:12.625
Russo?

45:13.585 --> 45:15.379
I trust Frank's instincts, sir.

45:15.462 --> 45:18.883
And I trust hard-earned,
thoroughly vetted intelligence.

45:18.966 --> 45:23.846
I'll take my information over the vague
notions of the war whisperer over here.

45:23.929 --> 45:25.765
Listen, asshole.
Let me tell you something.

45:25.848 --> 45:27.492
- You don't have operational command...
- This is...

45:27.516 --> 45:28.809
Wind it down, lieutenants.

45:29.935 --> 45:32.312
Last I checked,
neither of you were in command.

45:35.274 --> 45:36.274
Sir.

45:41.030 --> 45:43.365
Prep your teams.

45:44.366 --> 45:46.493
I think if we do this, men are gonna die.

45:48.662 --> 45:52.166
I pointed. Now you need to go shoot.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.919
- Sir.
- Dust off at 2300.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.546
- Now get the hell out of here.
- Roger.

46:10.225 --> 46:13.562
Once they get those mortars ranged in,
they're gonna pound us into the ground.

46:13.645 --> 46:16.941
I'm going through that building.
Clear a path for an evac.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.752
- You out of your mind?
- What do you wanna do?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.611
You wanna die here? Like a rat in a jar?

46:21.278 --> 46:23.363
It's about time I had a fair fight.

46:25.532 --> 46:27.742
- I'm going.
- Then I'm coming with you.

46:27.827 --> 46:29.286
You gotta stay here. Keep him safe.

46:29.369 --> 46:32.122
- What are you talking about? That's crazy.
- Bill, you stay here.

46:32.206 --> 46:34.833
Keep him safe. Cover.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.961
Frank.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.839
I gotta get home to the boss. I gotta go.

46:40.756 --> 46:41.756
Move.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.559
How you doing, sir?

46:55.395 --> 46:58.357
Reap what you sow, eh, Frank?

46:59.441 --> 47:01.235
Gonna do some reaping of my own.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.362
You just don't bleed out, you hear me?

47:03.445 --> 47:06.781
I'm gonna get you home, sir.
I'm gonna get you home.

47:06.866 --> 47:09.659

Did you kill the target?

51:21.453 --> 51:23.247
Did you get him?

51:24.664 --> 51:26.208
Did you kill the target?

51:26.291 --> 51:28.293
What'd you say?

51:29.961 --> 51:32.242
- What'd you say, you piece of shit?
- Whoa, whoa.

51:32.297 --> 51:33.840
You did this!

51:33.923 --> 51:35.443
- You did this, you hear me?
- Back up!

51:35.509 --> 51:36.843
I'll kill you!

51:36.926 --> 51:39.138
You did this! You did this!

51:39.221 --> 51:41.890
You want to kill the man?
I cannot let you do that.

51:41.973 --> 51:44.392
- Stand down!
- Why you protecting that piece of shit?

51:44.476 --> 51:47.187
I'm protecting you.
Guys like that, it's never on them!

51:53.067 --> 51:56.488
No. No, don't...
Don't touch... Don't touch me.

51:57.656 --> 51:59.032
Open your eyes, man.

51:59.991 --> 52:02.744
This whole thing...
This whole thing is bullshit!

52:02.827 --> 52:06.998
You don't like the way that it smells?
Get out! I am.

52:16.132 --> 52:18.092
I requested a transfer back to Force.

52:19.178 --> 52:23.307
I can't. We... We can't do this anymore!

52:26.518 --> 52:29.604
Let's... let's get out.

52:30.814 --> 52:32.274
I mean, look at us.

52:34.734 --> 52:35.902
Frank!

52:38.197 --> 52:39.531
Look at yourself.

52:51.751 --> 52:52.836
Bill.

53:02.596 --> 53:04.156
You could have ended it all that night.

53:04.806 --> 53:07.642
You didn't,
and then they killed your family.

53:08.768 --> 53:09.848
You have to live with that.

53:12.772 --> 53:15.191
But this war that you're waging,
I mean, come on.

53:15.275 --> 53:17.319
That's the US military. That is the CIA.

53:17.402 --> 53:21.489
You just got rolled over by one spook
zip-tied to an office chair, here.

53:22.324 --> 53:25.368
I mean, I thought I needed you,
but you need me just as bad.

53:28.913 --> 53:29.914
Look...

53:32.501 --> 53:37.256
I've spent months and months hacking into
every agency and their server.

53:37.339 --> 53:40.008
Phone companies, police departments,
it doesn't matter.

53:40.091 --> 53:43.428
Anything they can throw at us,
I can throw it right back at 'em.

53:44.012 --> 53:46.640
- I've been getting ready for you, Frank.
- What does that mean?

53:46.723 --> 53:49.684
What does that mean? It means that
every missile needs a guidance system.

53:49.768 --> 53:50.810
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Okay?

53:50.894 --> 53:53.146
Without me,
you're just a blunt instrument.

53:54.063 --> 53:57.276
Yeah, blow me off. Yeah. Do it.
Blow me off. That's right.

53:57.359 --> 54:00.737
Damn it.

54:04.699 --> 54:05.700
Sit down.

54:05.784 --> 54:07.494
- Ah...
- Get in.

54:08.703 --> 54:10.997
Don't be proud. Get in.
I want to show you something.

54:11.456 --> 54:12.749
- Come on. Get in.
- Ah, damn it.

54:14.751 --> 54:16.295
You son of a bitch.

54:22.634 --> 54:26.471
You know, that heroin was just financing
for something else.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.059
Your Operation Cerberus...

54:33.019 --> 54:34.980
...doesn't exist.

54:35.563 --> 54:38.483
There's no official record.
There's no congressional approval.

54:39.401 --> 54:41.778
It's totally off the books.
You know what that means?

54:43.321 --> 54:45.198
They turned you into a hit man, Frank.

54:48.618 --> 54:50.745
Now, I don't care
if we trust each other or not.

54:50.829 --> 54:53.957
I don't wanna be blood brothers.
That stuff is for kids in tree houses.

54:54.040 --> 54:56.501
But you and me,
we want the same thing right now.

54:57.251 --> 54:58.837
So work with me.

55:01.673 --> 55:02.882
One condition.

55:03.842 --> 55:05.385
- Yeah, name it.
- They die.

55:06.428 --> 55:07.428
Yeah?

55:10.098 --> 55:11.975
Every single one of 'em. No trials.

55:12.601 --> 55:13.893
No bullshit.

55:15.687 --> 55:16.771
They die.

55:22.152 --> 55:23.611
Yeah, I can live with that.
