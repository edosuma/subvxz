01:08.656 --> 01:10.402
Oh man...

01:22.976 --> 01:24.738
I'll be up in a bit.

01:24.739 --> 01:26.239
You better.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.686
Larry?

02:03.790 --> 02:04.820
What?

02:06.424 --> 02:07.863
That.

02:09.668 --> 02:11.877
What's that box
doing in our bedroom?

02:12.178 --> 02:12.678
Uh... I...

02:12.680 --> 02:15.610
I don't know, maybe
one of the crew left it.

02:17.113 --> 02:19.623
- Why'd they do that?
- I don't know.

02:21.428 --> 02:22.929
What is it?

02:22.930 --> 02:25.313
A card,
"FOR THE COLLECTION"

02:29.021 --> 02:30.517
Don't open it.

02:32.020 --> 02:33.056
No!

02:41.872 --> 02:44.324
Jesus...
Oh God!

05:57.961 --> 05:59.537
Is everything alright?

06:00.038 --> 06:02.675
Uh... just about as good as new.

06:02.676 --> 06:03.977
Oh yeah, Arkin?

06:04.479 --> 06:07.705
After you look at the door upstairs, could
you get the last of the window bars up today?

06:07.905 --> 06:09.365
Yeah, not a problem, sir.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.809
I know we're in
middle of nowhere, but ...

06:12.212 --> 06:14.744
Vicky still insists on Victorian decor.

07:00.208 --> 07:02.350
CHASE JEWELLERS
MICHAEL CHASE - PRESIDENT

07:13.466 --> 07:16.094
What shall I call you?

07:18.098 --> 07:19.914
How about Jill?

07:26.324 --> 07:27.788
Bye, Jill.

07:28.789 --> 07:29.817
Hey!

07:30.717 --> 07:32.340
I'm a mermaid.

07:32.542 --> 07:33.750
Okay.

07:33.651 --> 07:35.975
I'm having a tea party,
Mr. Arkin.

07:36.277 --> 07:39.121
- Oh well ...
- Would you care to join us?

07:41.826 --> 07:43.071
Sure.

08:01.902 --> 08:04.368
It's... it's very good.

08:04.969 --> 08:06.541
He made the tea.

08:07.444 --> 08:09.600
Well, it's very good, sir.

08:11.305 --> 08:13.103
You have a very nice room,
Hannah.

08:13.204 --> 08:14.648
This isn't my room.

08:14.649 --> 08:16.313
- No?
- I'm a mermaid.

08:16.514 --> 08:17.412
Okay.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.934
Mermaids sleep in caves,
not rooms.

08:22.597 --> 08:24.464
Can I ask you something?

08:25.766 --> 08:28.705
If you were to really
want a present.

08:29.206 --> 08:31.389
Something really special.

08:31.590 --> 08:32.990
What would it be?

08:33.491 --> 08:34.940
A baskin bear.

08:37.746 --> 08:40.756
Where would you get
a... baskin bear at?

08:40.857 --> 08:42.426
Toy store.

08:42.726 --> 08:44.235
Of course.

08:44.739 --> 08:47.085
Whoa! Excuse me!

08:47.687 --> 08:50.736
- Is everything alright in here?
- Yeah um, she...

08:52.640 --> 08:56.765
Hannah just uh... invited me
to her tea party.

08:56.848 --> 08:58.019
Is that right?

08:58.220 --> 08:59.758
I'm sorry, sir.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.244
I have one about her age.
A daughter.

09:03.646 --> 09:04.943
Name's Cindy.

09:05.444 --> 09:06.844
Oh...

09:06.848 --> 09:09.974
- Okay well uh...
- Well, I got your door working.

09:10.976 --> 09:12.210
Well, thanks.

09:12.211 --> 09:14.484
Thank you for coming,
Mr. Arkin.

10:28.239 --> 10:29.376
Hey!

10:29.377 --> 10:31.377
There's a wasp nest over there.

10:33.779 --> 10:37.258
There's a wasp nest,
by the... by the greenhouse.

10:58.386 --> 10:59.678
Hey.

11:00.582 --> 11:02.129
Let me bum a drag.

11:02.330 --> 11:04.669
Sorry, I'm not adding
to your... delinquency.

11:04.770 --> 11:06.570
What are you, a narc?

11:06.572 --> 11:08.106
Give me a drag.

11:15.616 --> 11:17.173
Arkin, right?

11:17.374 --> 11:18.474
Mm hmm.

11:18.575 --> 11:20.226
What kind of name is
Arkin, anyway?

11:20.327 --> 11:23.902
It's a first name.
What kind of name is Jill?

11:24.204 --> 11:25.756
It's my grandmother's name.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.780
She was the first female
Attorney General in the State.

11:30.584 --> 11:32.583
You're about to hear a fight.

11:32.989 --> 11:34.290
You done somethin' ?

11:35.491 --> 11:38.731
Yeah, but don't freak.
It's just a show.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.804
You better gimme 
that back then.

11:40.805 --> 11:43.453
I wouldn't wanna ruin
your performance.

11:46.159 --> 11:48.135
Later, Arkin.

12:14.171 --> 12:15.774
Nice try.

12:17.375 --> 12:18.875
I told you mom,
I don't wanna go.

12:19.179 --> 12:20.206
You can't do this to me.

12:20.207 --> 12:22.507
All of my friends are
staying here. I cannot go!

12:22.607 --> 12:24.166
It's not an option!

12:24.367 --> 12:25.867
You're going.

12:27.268 --> 12:30.003
I'm not going on a
family vacation with you!

12:33.411 --> 12:34.812
Arkin.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.984
- For the week.
- Thank you.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.653
There is a little bit of extra there.

12:39.654 --> 12:41.017
Oh, no, sir,
I can't take extra.

12:41.018 --> 12:42.875
No no, it's... it's for the
little one.

12:42.876 --> 12:44.476
I know how tough it can be.

12:45.774 --> 12:47.442
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

12:47.543 --> 12:49.145
You earned it.

12:49.146 --> 12:51.970
Listen, spend as much time as
you can with them when they're young.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.842
Something happens around age 13
and it get's kind of rough for awhile.

12:55.944 --> 12:58.977
What I understand?
Eventually they come back around.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.598
Anyway, see you in
a couple of weeks.

13:03.301 --> 13:05.099
Have a safe trip!

13:35.140 --> 13:36.542
What you doing there,
baby girl?

13:36.643 --> 13:37.546
Daddy!

13:37.547 --> 13:40.739
Shh... keep quiet for just a sec.

13:41.942 --> 13:44.124
I've got someone who
wants to meet you.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.526
Who?

13:48.531 --> 13:51.218
He says you have
to close your eyes.

13:56.928 --> 13:59.240
Alright, go ahead and 
open them.

14:03.046 --> 14:04.631
Do I get to keep him?

14:04.632 --> 14:06.703
Of course you get to 
keep him.

14:07.904 --> 14:09.548
Do you have it?

14:10.149 --> 14:11.249
Whoa.

14:14.158 --> 14:15.610
What is that?

14:16.012 --> 14:17.564
Daddy got him for me.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.890
God damn it.

14:21.693 --> 14:24.462
- Thank you Daddy.
- You're welcome, Cindy.

14:32.574 --> 14:34.635
Hey!

14:39.743 --> 14:41.362
You're supposed to
come by 6 hours ago.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.075
Yeah, so I just got a bit
tied up at work, you know?

14:44.177 --> 14:46.319
Do you or don't you
have the money?

14:52.026 --> 14:54.677
Look, it's not as much
as I said, but...

14:54.777 --> 14:56.109
it's something.

14:58.714 --> 14:59.800
What is this?

14:59.903 --> 15:01.918
You promised you'd
get it by tonight.

15:02.119 --> 15:03.221
I know,

15:03.322 --> 15:06.181
but these jobs don't
just happen overnight.

15:06.182 --> 15:08.662
- I have to have it today.
- Why today?

15:08.963 --> 15:10.617
Because the people 
I owe want it.

15:10.818 --> 15:14.008
So why don't you let me talk
to the people that you owe?

15:14.311 --> 15:15.958
They're loansharks, Arkin.

15:16.159 --> 15:18.759
It's due. That's all there is to it.

15:22.367 --> 15:25.227
- I'm leaving tonight.
- Where're you gonna go?

15:25.328 --> 15:28.158
You gonna go to your Mom's?
Or your sister's?

15:28.659 --> 15:31.513
And all this shit, what're you gonna do?
You gonna just disappear?

15:31.613 --> 15:33.372
They're gonna chase you!

15:33.674 --> 15:37.226
Look, I'm gonna get you
the money, alright?

15:37.426 --> 15:38.784
No, it's too late.

15:38.785 --> 15:40.685
No baby, come here.

15:40.686 --> 15:42.893
Just give me until midnight,
alright?

15:48.094 --> 15:49.494
Midnight.

16:20.538 --> 16:23.071
- Hello?
- Found what we're looking for.

16:23.072 --> 16:25.040
I'm going in and I
gotta get paid tonight.

16:25.041 --> 16:26.441
No way. On whose...

16:26.441 --> 16:28.345
I'm coming over right now.

17:35.037 --> 17:38.104
You would've grown it to
a skin there, kiddo.

17:41.608 --> 17:44.872
Now you've been casing
that family's house for months...

17:45.472 --> 17:48.126
And now that you've found
the jewel broker's safe...

17:48.228 --> 17:50.029
You go to come in here.

17:50.130 --> 17:51.695
With demands.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.396
We settle tonight.

17:54.598 --> 17:58.601
50% take.
The family is out of town.

17:58.801 --> 18:00.616
The stone is inside,

18:00.717 --> 18:02.297
and I need to get 
paid tonight.

18:02.299 --> 18:04.270
We got a routine.

18:05.373 --> 18:08.510
I pick the jobs.
You pick the locks.

18:08.710 --> 18:11.074
We pick up the prize together.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.775
That's the routine.

18:13.278 --> 18:15.387
You don't change routine.

18:15.586 --> 18:16.765
That's when mistakes happen.

18:16.866 --> 18:18.883
Tonight. Midnight.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.463
No can do.

18:20.464 --> 18:23.018
I guess I'll find
somebody that will.

18:24.522 --> 18:26.109
I run a...

18:26.110 --> 18:28.110
smooth operation
out here.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.428
You helped me on 
the inside.

18:30.429 --> 18:31.731
You did.

18:32.233 --> 18:33.893
But I never agreed
to your terms.

18:33.894 --> 18:36.694
Taking my help means
you did motherfucker!

18:37.494 --> 18:40.999
You don't come up here all
hopped up in your macho bullshit!

18:41.100 --> 18:44.750
You need to be thinkin'
about that woman of yours,

18:45.452 --> 18:47.716
and that little pretty
girl of yours.

18:48.523 --> 18:51.470
Now...

18:51.771 --> 18:54.171
What was that
request of yours?

18:56.276 --> 19:00.004
We settle tonight.
50% take.

19:01.708 --> 19:03.864
You don't like
your fingers do you?

19:03.965 --> 19:05.365
Huh motherfucker?

19:06.870 --> 19:09.453
I am the only guy that you
know that can get into that safe.

19:09.454 --> 19:12.065
So you got a better option
than me? Then roll it out!

19:20.266 --> 19:21.666
50.

19:28.541 --> 19:30.727
40. You take it or leave it.

19:32.731 --> 19:34.760
I guess I'll see ya
later tonight then.

27:17.104 --> 27:19.158
"Just give me until midnight."

27:19.559 --> 27:21.159
"Midnight."

27:43.793 --> 27:47.192
Let go of me!
Please leave me alone!

28:23.161 --> 28:24.629
You!

28:25.231 --> 28:27.470
Why are you doing this?

28:28.473 --> 28:31.142
Why are you doing this?

28:31.143 --> 28:32.543
You son of a bitch...

28:34.350 --> 28:36.307
You son of a bitch!

29:24.718 --> 29:26.351
Shit...

35:55.563 --> 35:58.033
Just stop! Stop!
Shh...

35:58.234 --> 36:01.334
Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you.

36:05.635 --> 36:07.135
Michael, listen...

36:07.142 --> 36:10.205
I have nothing to do with this.
You gotta believe me, okay?

36:10.808 --> 36:13.175
There were... there were
tools down here right?

36:13.176 --> 36:16.818
- Where were they?
- I don't know, he took 'em.

36:16.719 --> 36:18.805
Oh God!
Shh! Shh!

36:21.108 --> 36:24.998
My wife... my wife...
how... my wife...

36:24.999 --> 36:26.607
Where... where's your wife?

36:26.608 --> 36:28.526
She's in there.

36:30.331 --> 36:31.652
Where's Jill and Hannah?

36:31.753 --> 36:33.552
Jill left before he got here.

36:33.619 --> 36:34.702
And Hannah is she in here?

36:34.703 --> 36:36.003
I don't know.

36:36.005 --> 36:39.406
God, I don't know...
I don't...

36:40.609 --> 36:45.256
Okay, I'm gonna find 'em.
I'll find them. Calm down.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.243
My gun ...

36:48.244 --> 36:50.566
It's the only way,
you have get my handgun.

36:50.866 --> 36:53.343
You got a gun?
Where is your gun?

36:53.444 --> 36:56.418
It's in the safe in my bedroom.

36:56.520 --> 36:58.323
Behind the mirror.

36:59.026 --> 37:00.685
Bullets are in the bottom drawer.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.889
What's the combination?

37:03.390 --> 37:06.937
15 ... 24 ... 7.

37:06.938 --> 37:10.237
15-24-7, all right.
Just stay quiet.

37:10.238 --> 37:12.739
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

37:14.411 --> 37:15.664
Oh God!

37:35.694 --> 37:38.507
Hey! Hey! I'm here to
help you. It's ok. Shh...

37:39.909 --> 37:42.609
We're taking that
gag off okay?

37:50.621 --> 37:52.301
Yeah... yeah...

37:53.400 --> 37:55.559
Can you get this off my eyes?

37:58.865 --> 38:01.033
Please ...

38:02.837 --> 38:07.368
Nah... Nah... listen,
I can't. I can't.

38:07.369 --> 38:10.178
- Why?
- I can't take that off.

38:10.179 --> 38:13.109
Have you seen Hannah?
Where's my baby?

38:13.110 --> 38:15.182
I didn't see her. I don't
think she's in the house.

38:15.883 --> 38:19.182
No no... she's hiding.
He hasn't got to her yet.

38:19.183 --> 38:20.614
You have to find her.

38:20.615 --> 38:23.154
Okay, okay I will.
I'll keep looking.

38:23.155 --> 38:24.657
- My baby ...
- Shh!

38:24.658 --> 38:27.364
Victoria, I will.
I'll get her, okay?

38:27.365 --> 38:30.590
But listen, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

38:30.792 --> 38:34.645
I need you to help me.
I'm gonna need you to scream.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.948
Oh no... no no...

38:35.949 --> 38:39.289
Listen, I just need a distraction
so I can get up there.

38:39.390 --> 38:41.490
If I get up there,
I can find Hannah.

38:41.590 --> 38:44.473
But I need to get upstairs.

38:44.896 --> 38:49.597
When he comes down here, stop
screaming so he doesn't hurt you, alright?

38:49.698 --> 38:51.699
Can you do that?

38:51.800 --> 38:53.421
It's okay.

38:53.422 --> 38:56.304
I'm gonna get you out of
here but I need your help.

38:56.403 --> 38:58.816
I need to get up there.

38:58.819 --> 39:00.566
- Okay?
- Okay...

39:02.971 --> 39:05.746
Give me just a second,
and then you start screamin'.

39:05.747 --> 39:09.263
- I promise you I'll be back.
- Okay...

40:56.881 --> 40:58.259
No!

41:52.037 --> 41:55.460
There's no fuckin' bullets...
Where's the fucking bullets?

42:20.800 --> 42:22.226
Hannah?

42:26.833 --> 42:28.830
Hannah is that you?

42:31.132 --> 42:32.878
Hannah?

42:36.987 --> 42:39.147
Hannah is that you?

43:18.412 --> 43:20.030
Hannah?

43:25.731 --> 43:28.331
- Get out!
- Who the hell are you?

43:29.737 --> 43:31.920
Larry Horn.

43:31.921 --> 43:33.474
Jesus ...

43:34.479 --> 43:36.363
No... no...

43:36.963 --> 43:39.952
What does this guy want?
What... what does he want?

43:40.255 --> 43:42.226
He collects people ...

43:42.229 --> 43:44.789
No no, he's killing people.
He's killing them.

43:44.888 --> 43:49.538
No no no, he only kills people
that he doesn't want.

43:49.539 --> 43:51.227
The rest he takes.
He takes them.

43:51.228 --> 43:52.981
Then why are you here?

43:53.280 --> 43:55.584
I'm the bait.

43:57.686 --> 44:01.362
If you're not chosen, you'll
never leave this house alive!

44:01.363 --> 44:04.336
He only takes one!
He only takes one... no!

44:09.038 --> 44:11.739
No!
No!

47:24.074 --> 47:25.395
Hey, it's me...

47:25.396 --> 47:26.598
Come here.

47:26.500 --> 47:28.245
Let's get this off you.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.746
Come on, get it off.
Get it off, come on.

47:37.360 --> 47:40.464
I couldn't find Hannah anywhere.
I don't think she's in the house.

47:40.465 --> 47:42.268
She has to be here.

47:42.268 --> 47:45.176
I looked everywhere.
I didn't see her.

47:46.680 --> 47:49.597
Where's Michael?
-He's okay. He's fine.

47:49.598 --> 47:52.831
After I get you out of here,
I'm gonna get him out of here okay?

47:53.832 --> 47:56.878
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

47:57.079 --> 47:59.550
I gotta get outta here...
I gotta get outta here!

47:59.753 --> 48:03.459
Please, one second...
One second...

48:11.368 --> 48:16.293
A robbery... I've prepared myself
for that but not this... not this!

48:16.294 --> 48:17.559
I don't wanna die!

48:17.560 --> 48:19.070
You're not gonna die!

48:19.071 --> 48:21.548
Shh... shh... You're not
gonna die. Shh... shh...

48:21.651 --> 48:25.144
- Hold still.
- And Hannah, gonna get Hannah.

48:25.145 --> 48:26.422
And Hannah too.

48:27.222 --> 48:29.191
Now listen, when we get
outta here,

48:29.192 --> 48:31.392
I'm gonna hide you okay?

48:31.492 --> 48:33.718
You can't say a word, okay?

48:33.819 --> 48:38.428
And when we go out of here,
you keep your eyes on my back.

48:38.430 --> 48:41.411
Alright? Keep your eyes
on my back. Come on...

51:45.970 --> 51:47.704
Why didn't you listen to me!

51:47.805 --> 51:49.805
I told you to stay with me!

52:22.150 --> 52:23.901
Shit.

52:44.531 --> 52:46.827
Easy... you'll wake the neighbors.

52:46.830 --> 52:48.859
What neighbors?

52:50.360 --> 52:51.360
Hey.

52:52.161 --> 52:53.861
Hey!

52:54.167 --> 52:56.130
Jill, stop!

53:03.842 --> 53:05.606
Jill!

53:16.622 --> 53:18.383
Let's do it right here.

53:18.485 --> 53:21.618
I'm not doing it on
my front porch.

53:27.527 --> 53:28.797
Damn it.

53:28.898 --> 53:30.299
What?

53:31.401 --> 53:34.413
I think my mom
changed the locks on me.

53:49.359 --> 53:51.023
You sure they're not here?

53:51.225 --> 53:52.567
Yeah, positive.

53:53.269 --> 53:54.649
Let's go.

54:39.011 --> 54:40.978
Definitely not typical.

54:42.481 --> 54:44.014
Who cares?

55:01.940 --> 55:03.251
I don't think so.

55:03.553 --> 55:05.329
Where do think
you're going?

55:25.760 --> 55:28.177
I really think we
should do it right.

55:30.779 --> 55:32.159
Oh...

58:19.234 --> 58:21.568
911, please state
your emergency.

59:05.931 --> 59:07.374
Oh God no.

59:09.477 --> 59:11.175
Oh my God!

59:44.524 --> 59:45.748
Hey! Hey!

59:45.749 --> 59:47.549
Don't make a sound!
It's me!

59:48.650 --> 59:51.432
What are you doing here?

59:50.833 --> 59:52.262
I'm gonna get you out of here.

59:52.263 --> 59:55.663
- Where is my family?
- Jill, you gotta be quiet!

59:55.665 --> 59:58.048
Look at me!
You gotta be quiet!

59:58.449 --> 01:00:00.049
Come on...

01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:03.065
No... no...

01:00:03.866 --> 01:00:05.166
No!

01:00:16.467 --> 01:00:18.467
Jill! Don't!

01:00:59.746 --> 01:01:01.808
Help me. Help me please!

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.953
You gotta push...
Help me here!

01:01:07.754 --> 01:01:09.154
Help me...

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:13.577
- Help me... please help me.
- You gotta help me push up!

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:20.842
No... no... no! Please don't leave me!

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:22.643
No... no... please...

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:27.093
No! No! Please! Please!
Please come back!

01:01:28.296 --> 01:01:30.024
- I'm sorry...
- Please come back!

01:01:30.326 --> 01:01:32.165
Please don't go!

01:02:39.761 --> 01:02:40.852
Run... run little girl.

01:02:40.853 --> 01:02:43.253
Run!

01:03:34.524 --> 01:03:35.971
Where the hell were you?

01:03:36.073 --> 01:03:38.713
Please, don't let
the man get me.

01:03:40.018 --> 01:03:43.323
We're gonna lose him now ok?
Now, would you listen to me?

01:03:43.625 --> 01:03:45.847
- You gotta stay off the floor ok?
- I can do that.

01:03:45.849 --> 01:03:48.598
- Alright, you can do that?
- Yeah... yeah.

01:04:27.954 --> 01:04:29.488
Now!

01:05:05.341 --> 01:05:06.724
Damn it!

01:05:07.325 --> 01:05:09.226
Damn! Fuck!

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.271
The laundry chute!

01:05:34.775 --> 01:05:36.781
Does it go all the way down?

01:05:37.584 --> 01:05:39.678
I want you to get outta the way ok?
I'm coming right behind you.

01:09:00.859 --> 01:09:03.073
Just let her go.

01:09:04.078 --> 01:09:05.524
You got her father.

01:09:06.027 --> 01:09:08.814
You got me.
Just let her go.

01:09:09.417 --> 01:09:11.964
You never would've
found her anyway.

01:10:09.146 --> 01:10:10.725
Stay away!

01:10:18.635 --> 01:10:20.301
Where are you going?

01:10:21.103 --> 01:10:23.592
Is that all you got?
You little bitch!

01:10:28.202 --> 01:10:30.830
Is that all you got?
You fucking faggot!

01:10:33.736 --> 01:10:37.498
Is that all you got?
You little fucking faggot bitch!

01:10:42.106 --> 01:10:45.636
Come here you faggot!
I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:51.744
Fuck you!

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:20.831
Get it off!
Get it off!

01:11:20.832 --> 01:11:22.932
Get it off me!

01:11:28.442 --> 01:11:30.103
Get away!

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:39.772
Dispatch, this is unit 316 
responding to a possible 911.

01:12:07.913 --> 01:12:09.788
Oh my God.

01:12:33.722 --> 01:12:35.523
Freeze! 
Do not move!

01:12:35.723 --> 01:12:37.157
Freeze!

01:12:37.759 --> 01:12:39.116
Raise your arms!

01:12:39.217 --> 01:12:40.701
Raise 'em!

01:12:41.102 --> 01:12:42.503
Drop your weapon!

01:12:43.807 --> 01:12:45.646
Drop the weapon!

01:12:47.548 --> 01:12:49.544
Unit 316, dispatch...

01:13:43.721 --> 01:13:45.306
Hannah?
Hannah, stay back.

01:13:58.707 --> 01:14:00.207
My God, he's gonna
blow the house up.

01:14:02.026 --> 01:14:03.455
He's gonna blow up
the house.

01:14:14.970 --> 01:14:17.901
Unit 316, all units
are responding.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.906
Hurry!

01:14:43.222 --> 01:14:44.027
He's coming!

01:14:44.028 --> 01:14:45.863
He's supposed to come
down the stairs okay?

01:14:45.864 --> 01:14:47.464
He's coming! Hurry!

01:14:53.872 --> 01:14:55.856
I'm gonna go up there and
I'm gonna pull you up okay?

01:14:55.957 --> 01:14:57.460
- Okay.
- Stay right here.

01:15:37.514 --> 01:15:39.510
What are you doing?

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.042
Come here...
You gotta help me.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.600
It's broken.

01:21:15.722 --> 01:21:16.949
This guy, the exterminator.

01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:19.550
He was the same guy working
earlier in the day right?

01:21:20.328 --> 01:21:21.888
And you saw his face?

01:21:20.889 --> 01:21:22.458
Yes, I saw.

01:21:23.959 --> 01:21:25.607
What happened
inside the house?

01:21:26.209 --> 01:21:27.746
Tried to save 'em...

01:21:28.847 --> 01:21:30.600
I really did...

01:21:31.705 --> 01:21:35.265
Sir? Company's called MASTER TRAP
EXTERMINATION. We got an address.

01:21:36.166 --> 01:21:37.845
Pull him tight and get
him to the hospital.

01:22:10.191 --> 01:22:11.793
What time is it?

01:22:16.602 --> 01:22:18.306
Just before midnight.

01:22:21.112 --> 01:22:22.537
I made it.

01:22:23.038 --> 01:22:24.440
What?

01:22:25.543 --> 01:22:27.286
I need you to
call my wife.

01:22:28.390 --> 01:22:30.201
They'll take care of
all that at the hospital.

01:22:30.704 --> 01:22:33.294
Come on now. You gotta...
You gotta call her.

01:22:33.295 --> 01:22:35.299
Alright! Alright!
What's the number?

01:23:10.249 --> 01:23:11.495
Hello!

01:23:12.903 --> 01:23:14.181
Hey!
