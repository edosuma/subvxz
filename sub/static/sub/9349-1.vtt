01:40.628 --> 01:42.821
Can I get either of you
gentlemen anything else?

01:42.877 --> 01:45.384
— You want another drink?
— Uh, no, I’m fine thanks.

01:45.572 --> 01:47.972
We’ll take another bottle
of the Chateau Margaux.

01:48.118 --> 01:49.195
You’ll be fine.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.091
Listen, I’m sorry Michael isn’t here yet.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.063
His plane got delayed
getting into Teterboro.

01:54.117 --> 01:55.099
That’s fine.

01:55.508 --> 01:59.255
He likes to meet all the executive
candidates, it’s kind of a tradition or a…

01:59.313 --> 02:00.381
neuroses.

02:01.464 --> 02:02.425
It’s nice of him though.

02:02.437 --> 02:04.665
It is actually, until
he does his one joke.

02:05.122 --> 02:07.145
“I thought you said he wasn’t
handsome.”

02:08.216 --> 02:09.776
That’s an oldie but a goodie, I guess.

02:11.306 --> 02:12.862
So what time you heading out tomorrow?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.584
Well actually, Sue’s up there now,

02:14.608 --> 02:18.105
I was gonna get he last bus tonight and
get an early start tomorrow morning.

02:18.262 --> 02:21.509
You know hen we called the office out West
you were the only name they gave us.

02:21.534 --> 02:22.869
It’s nice of them.

02:23.236 --> 02:25.382
Listen, Steve, we’re a
9 billion dollar company.

02:25.517 --> 02:29.592
Yeah. If someone is recommending you,
it’s not nice… it’s numbers.

02:29.718 --> 02:30.967
I appreciate that.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.374
Now let me ask you something.

02:33.830 --> 02:38.060
You guys have closed more towns than the
team behind you by almost triple digits.

02:38.346 --> 02:43.679
But the price point that we pay out on
your leases is half of everyone else’s.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.127
How do you do that?

02:45.401 --> 02:47.891
— Well I’m from Eldridge, Iowa.
— Meaning?

02:49.274 --> 02:52.826
It… might as well have
been Rifle, Colorado,

02:52.925 --> 02:56.244
Dish, Texas or Lafayette, Louisiana.
Any of these towns we’ve sold.

02:56.478 --> 02:58.054
I know them, they know me.

02:58.203 --> 03:01.803
Well, unfortunately the rest of our road
teams don’t find it as quite so easy.

03:01.981 --> 03:04.669
I grew up in a large farming community.

03:05.147 --> 03:09.339
Football Fridays, tractor
pulls, cow tipping, all of it.

03:10.215 --> 03:13.431
I mean, I’m one of two guys in my
graduating class who went to college

03:13.433 --> 03:15.532
and studied something
other than agriculture.

03:15.813 --> 03:17.928
It’s the biggest fight
my grandfather and I ever had.

03:17.994 --> 03:19.975
— Just a pride, I guess.
— No.

03:20.795 --> 03:23.195
It’s delusional self mythology.

03:23.296 --> 03:24.856
It’s bullshit.

03:25.598 --> 03:28.598
We had a Caterpillar plant down
in Davenport a few miles away.

03:29.271 --> 03:32.349
They closed that down in my junior year.
I didn’t think anything of it.

03:32.490 --> 03:34.590
By the time my senior prom moved around,

03:34.591 --> 03:37.659
I got to see, first hand, just how little
legs we had to stand on.

03:37.767 --> 03:41.530
I mean, the whole farming town
fantasy just shattered.

03:41.851 --> 03:47.098
The truth was, without the plant,
without the industry, we had nothing.

03:48.308 --> 03:49.868
And my whole town was…

03:54.001 --> 03:55.600
I’m not selling them Natural Gas.

03:55.619 --> 03:57.707
I’m selling the only way
they have to get back.

03:59.922 --> 04:01.133
Best of luck, Steve.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.396
Is this the guy?

04:05.517 --> 04:07.216
Well you said he wasn’t handsome!

04:09.270 --> 04:10.560
Sorry I’m late.

04:11.470 --> 04:13.270
Had to stop at home on my way down.

04:13.950 --> 04:16.011
My daughter, it’s her birthday today.

04:16.692 --> 04:19.141
She’s turning 13 already.
I can’t believe—

04:54.857 --> 04:59.935
PROMISED LAND
Transcript and sync: jcdr

07:00.612 --> 07:01.812
Good morning, Boss.

07:03.159 --> 07:04.359
Oh, stop it.

07:05.197 --> 07:07.603
I’m not supposed to call you ‘Boss’, now?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.119
They’ll let me know.

07:10.776 --> 07:12.266
That’s the best you could do?

07:12.363 --> 07:15.180
No. But I wasn’t looking
for the best, was I?

07:15.211 --> 07:16.771
Ah, you know what I mean.

07:17.863 --> 07:18.823
Stick!

07:22.162 --> 07:23.722
You do it on purpose.

07:24.025 --> 07:25.585
You’re right, I do.

07:33.123 --> 07:34.323
Was it worth it?

07:38.920 --> 07:40.120
Suck it!

07:53.904 --> 07:57.019
“Rob’s Guns, Groceries, Guitars and Gas.”

07:57.584 --> 07:59.384
God, I wish I thought of that.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.092
So where’d they put you up?
The Sheraton?

08:04.482 --> 08:05.729
Uh, Four Seasons.

08:05.824 --> 08:06.944
— What?
— Mm-hmm.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.690
— Jesus!
— Yeah.

08:08.941 --> 08:11.941
And I was right, this is the
entry point for the whole state.

08:13.072 --> 08:14.413
Yeah, I like that.

08:15.148 --> 08:17.377
It’s like dominoes.
— Yeah, it is.

08:17.661 --> 08:19.221
Hey, what season is this?

08:19.604 --> 08:21.617
They’re still wearing flannel up here?

08:21.752 --> 08:24.382
Place like this, they always do flannel.

08:24.562 --> 08:25.906
Yeah. Or camo.

08:26.976 --> 08:28.773
I am not wearing camo.

08:30.915 --> 08:32.313
Do you wear gloves?

08:32.365 --> 08:33.924
I never use them.

08:34.462 --> 08:35.662
It’s a yes.

08:36.231 --> 08:38.014
— Ok, you ‘bout ready?
— Yup.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.904
Hey. Boots!

08:42.312 --> 08:45.684
Huh? No. I’m not going
over this with you again.

08:45.704 --> 08:48.670
These are my grandfather’s boots,
and they’re made in America.

08:48.749 --> 08:50.645
Yeah, like in 1947.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.538
Yeah, a pair of air balloon.

08:53.017 --> 08:56.569
Oh my God, now you weren’t
kidding about the guitars.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.124
I guess you’re not here to buy a guitar.

09:10.817 --> 09:12.754
You’re the natural gas people.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.025
I’m sorry?

09:16.110 --> 09:18.172
Apologizing right off the bat, I like it!

09:18.206 --> 09:21.992
It’s endearing and vulnerable,
and yet, honest and direct.

09:23.227 --> 09:26.045
Your ID card, it’s kind
of a dead give away.

09:27.618 --> 09:29.418
It’s about time you all showed up.

09:29.714 --> 09:30.522
Yeah?

09:30.608 --> 09:33.533
Well, hell yeah. We can’t
sell the scenery, can we?

09:34.077 --> 09:35.231
That’s good.

09:35.819 --> 09:37.231
Wanna come work for us?

09:38.137 --> 09:39.697
And leave all this?

09:41.702 --> 09:42.822
Cash only.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.466
— Really?
— No.

09:52.350 --> 09:53.750
Shut up.

09:56.436 --> 09:57.753
Go ahead if you have to.

09:57.793 --> 10:00.493
No, I’m just glad to think it’s great
that you’re making friends.

10:01.056 --> 10:02.176
Now shut up.

10:06.764 --> 10:09.904
I can’t believe this is right outside
the city, it looks like Kentucky.

10:10.652 --> 10:14.735
No, two hours outside any city looks
like Kentucky, you should know that.

10:14.908 --> 10:17.308
Something weird about those horses?

10:17.564 --> 10:18.960
No, not really.

10:20.388 --> 10:21.808
Wait, are they small?

10:21.871 --> 10:25.001
They seem very small.
They seems smaller than you. Right?

10:25.027 --> 10:26.587
My eyesight’s going.

10:27.345 --> 10:28.663
Maybe they’re ponies?

10:28.692 --> 10:30.252
Those are not ponies.

10:31.409 --> 10:35.367
Remember new region, so we can
go as high as 5000 and 18%.

10:36.133 --> 10:40.154
Don’t ponies have big heads?
I mean, like proportionally?

10:54.364 --> 10:55.564
Hello there!

10:57.813 --> 11:00.092
Are you the owner of this place?
— No, sir.

11:00.561 --> 11:01.521
No?

11:02.184 --> 11:03.814
Well how come you’re
doing all the work?

11:03.911 --> 11:05.111
I don’t know.

11:05.291 --> 11:07.091
Well, who do I talk to about that?

11:07.252 --> 11:08.212
My Dad.

11:08.330 --> 11:12.746
Your Dad, okay. I’m gonna find your Dad,
I’m gonna straighten all this out!

11:16.453 --> 11:18.443
— Oh, hi!
— I thought the census was over?

11:18.512 --> 11:21.783
Uh, no, I’m—I’m with the Natural Gas
company. You got a second?

11:21.854 --> 11:23.611
Hell, why didn’t you say so.
Come on in.

11:24.275 --> 11:25.835
You went shopping?

11:25.912 --> 11:26.616
Sorry?

11:26.654 --> 11:29.730
I said, you went shopping,
here you got a tag.

11:31.144 --> 11:32.087
There you go.

11:32.139 --> 11:35.595
Oh, well. So much for
trying to look like a local.

11:38.661 --> 11:39.861
Nice boots.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.074
Thank you.

11:43.767 --> 11:44.702
Thank you Sir.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.893
That is some wild color, right?

11:50.284 --> 11:52.297
Is that Thor?
— Ironman.

11:52.610 --> 11:54.688
Is it? Oh, yeah!

11:54.820 --> 11:56.310
God, it’s nice.

11:56.437 --> 11:58.895
Can I have that, my kid
would really love that!

11:58.927 --> 12:00.153
I’m kidding.

12:01.252 --> 12:04.398
Reading this morning ‘bout all
the gas drillin’ in Pennsylvania.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.039
‘Stanton Gas’, is that you guys?

12:06.070 --> 12:09.145
Oh no, I’m representing ‘Global
Crosspower Solutions’. But,

12:09.190 --> 12:10.411
there’s a bunch of us.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.861
Well, you’re probably the best.

12:13.242 --> 12:15.042
Hey, you wanna come work for us?

12:15.115 --> 12:18.880
Even before the drilling,
the initial phase of development

12:19.032 --> 12:21.201
will boost your town’s tax revenue.

12:21.810 --> 12:25.167
That means that money will be
injected into the town immediately.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.592
’Cause what it means to me…

12:28.569 --> 12:30.527
One of the only reason I live where I live

12:30.635 --> 12:32.887
is because of the school my son goes to.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.384
I want everything for him.

12:35.658 --> 12:38.845
And everything, to me,
starts with an education.

12:39.351 --> 12:41.151
So our leases start at $2000.

12:41.758 --> 12:44.221
— Wait, that’s it?
— That’s right.

12:45.368 --> 12:48.147
Well, that’s not necessarily
life changing money, is it?

12:48.249 --> 12:49.449
Oh, it’s per acre.

12:50.402 --> 12:51.485
You have 20.

12:51.517 --> 12:53.857
So, I think there are a lot of people
around here that would say

12:53.883 --> 12:57.076
$40,000, well, that’s pretty good money.
Especially for doing nothing.

12:57.248 --> 13:01.050
But the real reason I’m here at this early
stage is because our research shows that

13:01.091 --> 13:04.174
your particular plot of land
has a potentially “high yield”.

13:04.511 --> 13:08.571
Now what that means is that not only
the size of the deposit,

13:08.697 --> 13:12.116
but actually the quality of
the shale is in the top tier.

13:12.546 --> 13:13.666
Yeah.

13:13.981 --> 13:16.621
Carson’s chances of going
to college are too low.

13:16.950 --> 13:21.658
And without a college education, and this
job market, that means manual labor.

13:21.776 --> 13:22.896
Those jobs are gone.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.242
Technology is our sons’ future.

13:25.390 --> 13:28.333
There’s no reason your town shouldn’t
have a state of the art high school.

13:28.366 --> 13:31.505
Getting education that allows him
to compete on the highest level.

13:33.442 --> 13:35.299
And that’s why we offer an 8 percent share

13:35.308 --> 13:37.311
in any and all profits that
we see from your wells.

13:37.345 --> 13:40.920
And so with this top tier level of shit,
what kind of money are you talking about?

13:41.004 --> 13:43.614
— Oh well, I can’t say yet but—
— It’s ballpark for me, man.

13:43.630 --> 13:46.630
I mean, other people
in similar situations?

13:46.753 --> 13:47.953
Millions.

13:50.071 --> 13:53.514
I mean—you mean, for,
you know, are you guys, or?

13:54.600 --> 13:55.800
You……

13:57.550 --> 13:59.336
could be a millionaire.

14:05.257 --> 14:07.582
See what it stands and
what this agreement looks like.

14:08.450 --> 14:10.270
That’s it right there.

14:15.655 --> 14:16.874
Nice talk today.

14:20.586 --> 14:24.286
Kind of anti-climactic, I thought
it would be harder. It’s too easy.

14:31.238 --> 14:32.358
What?

14:36.409 --> 14:37.809
I got it.

14:39.587 --> 14:40.367
Really?

14:40.508 --> 14:42.099
From V.P. of Land Management.

14:46.482 --> 14:47.602
Wow.

14:48.405 --> 14:51.191
It’s great. I’m proud of ya.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.553
Oh shit.

14:57.254 --> 14:59.222
Danny, I don’t know what to say.

14:59.449 --> 15:00.569
I know Heather.

15:01.237 --> 15:02.523
It’s only two way tickets.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.414
Did anybody get on base?

15:05.157 --> 15:06.277
No.

15:06.922 --> 15:09.451
Well then that makes it
almost a perfect game.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.521
That is amazing!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.205
It’s not a whole game, mom.

15:13.557 --> 15:16.195
Okay, well, you should—you just—still
you should be celebrating,

15:16.216 --> 15:17.956
you shouldn’t be seating
here talking to me.

15:18.055 --> 15:19.175
Hey, Ms. T.!

15:20.488 --> 15:21.750
Hi Colin.

15:22.735 --> 15:24.118
So where you guys headed?

15:24.298 --> 15:26.608
I don’t know. Sarah Dayton’s
having a party, I think.

15:27.491 --> 15:28.811
You look nice.

15:28.936 --> 15:30.056
Okay.

15:30.710 --> 15:32.486
I love you so much.

15:32.525 --> 15:34.345
— Okay mom.
— Okay.

15:36.401 --> 15:37.521
Go.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.444
Hey!

15:59.114 --> 16:00.916
Mr. Richards? Hi, I’m Steve Butler.

16:00.931 --> 16:02.479
— Steve, it’s a pleasure.
— Nice to meet you.

16:02.510 --> 16:05.132
— And call me Gerry for God’s sake.
— Oh, great.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.227
— Anything to drink?
— Steve?

16:08.586 --> 16:10.068
Uh, yeah, a cup of coffee.

16:10.273 --> 16:12.568
— For you, Jerry?
— Oh I’m fine, thanks Lynn.

16:14.185 --> 16:18.050
Well, listen, I appreciate you sitting
down with me, I know you’re busy but I…

16:18.073 --> 16:19.151
Oh yeah, yeah.

16:19.177 --> 16:21.182
I just thought it’d be a good idea
for you and I to get together

16:21.192 --> 16:24.432
before the town hall tomorrow so
that we can get to know each other.

16:24.474 --> 16:27.604
Of course, no no, look, as the senior
member of the supervisors board,

16:27.627 --> 16:29.815
thank you for sitting down
with me. I appreciate it.

16:31.179 --> 16:33.171
Pretty exciting all
this natural gas stuff.

16:33.203 --> 16:34.333
It is very exciting.

16:34.357 --> 16:36.911
— Whole lot of money down there!
— That is also true.

16:36.951 --> 16:39.967
How much do you think? How much
money you think we got down there?

16:40.191 --> 16:44.259
Well, uh, your Global’s research team
hasn’t finished their analysis yet,

16:44.276 --> 16:48.859
but I think it could be as much
as 15 to 20 million dollars.

16:49.194 --> 16:50.394
Is that right?

16:50.526 --> 16:51.726
I mean it could be, yeah.

16:55.801 --> 16:56.809
Thank you.

16:58.192 --> 17:01.017
Well… Listen, I’ve, uh…

17:01.128 --> 17:05.797
I’ve been doing a little research about
all this, gone online a little bit, and…

17:05.867 --> 17:08.131
well, I’ve read all these
rumblings on Natural Gas

17:08.156 --> 17:10.560
possibly contaminates water sources?

17:10.592 --> 17:12.208
You know, killing crops and what not.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.153
Yeah. You know, I’ve read
all that stuff too.

17:14.308 --> 17:17.281
There’re stories of people
lighting their water on fire.

17:17.333 --> 17:20.772
People getting sick. Steve.
That sounds nasty.

17:20.909 --> 17:23.594
Well—Well, there are lost
of scare tactics at play here.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.047
Oh. But—Look, I, uh…

17:26.415 --> 17:29.499
I have a responsibility
to protect these people.

17:29.543 --> 17:31.259
To ensure their safety.
— Yes.

17:31.416 --> 17:32.939
And to be honest…

17:34.125 --> 17:35.245
Well…

17:35.359 --> 17:38.136
I’m just not so sure I’m too
comfortable telling my constituents

17:38.177 --> 17:40.763
to allow you folks to come into our town.

17:40.855 --> 17:42.655
No matter how much money you have.

17:42.717 --> 17:46.027
— Okay. Well, Mr. Richards, because—
— Now…—

17:46.907 --> 17:50.834
I know that you folks have quite
the operation in the works, here.

17:50.907 --> 17:53.897
With plans to set up
throughout the state, huh?

17:54.436 --> 17:55.217
Yeah.

17:55.252 --> 17:59.077
Well, I’d hate to be the guy that
jeopardize all that for you.

17:59.929 --> 18:04.340
To lead this one little “podunk”
town to reject your company.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.840
To reject natural Gas. Wow!

18:07.504 --> 18:10.697
I can’t even imagine what
that would do to you guys.

18:10.926 --> 18:16.697
Especially ‘fore that this got out,
you know, in the papers, on the news, hmm?

18:18.143 --> 18:19.343
It’s 30,000.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.617
What’s that?

18:22.834 --> 18:24.634
I can offer you 30,000 dollars.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.132
Can I get you anything else?

18:29.328 --> 18:32.630
You know what, Lynn, I think
we’re done here. Just the check please.

18:37.722 --> 18:40.720
The Marcellus shale,
estimated at 2 trillion dollars,

18:40.761 --> 18:44.524
with billions in potential tax
revenue to individual states.

18:45.829 --> 18:46.789
Google.

18:47.867 --> 18:50.232
First one that came up, first sentence.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.989
Now you wanna re-think that joke
number you mentioned earlier, hm?

18:55.646 --> 18:59.128
Mr. Richards, I’m-I’m just being
straight with you, it’s simple math.

18:59.277 --> 19:02.774
Best case scenario there’s 30
million dollars under your town.

19:02.870 --> 19:07.149
.1% of that is 30,000 dollars,
that’s what I’m authorized to offer you.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.552
I’m also telling you
it’s a one time offer.

19:12.169 --> 19:13.369
Don’t get up.

19:15.011 --> 19:16.088
Don’t do that.

19:21.099 --> 19:23.499
I’ve been at this table before
and it doesn’t end well.

19:24.908 --> 19:27.308
Look, I don’t fault you for trying.

19:27.379 --> 19:28.470
But, I’m telling you…

19:29.153 --> 19:30.470
Don’t do this.

19:30.666 --> 19:32.962
Because we will walk away.
We always do.

19:34.422 --> 19:36.904
And after every single
town within 3 states

19:37.007 --> 19:40.512
has signed up for this, and the blows
of this economy are almost unbearable,

19:40.551 --> 19:42.111
we’re gonna come back.

19:42.291 --> 19:45.460
And we’re gonna offer you nothing.
We will offer this town nothing.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.982
Every contract we’ve signed,
every piece of the pie

19:48.039 --> 19:49.779
we’ve offered, it all goes away.

19:50.278 --> 19:52.490
And we buy this place for nothing.

19:55.956 --> 19:57.356
Now please…

19:58.721 --> 20:00.521
Let some other guy be last.

20:04.192 --> 20:05.392
I got it.

20:07.377 --> 20:08.777
Thank you.

20:13.716 --> 20:15.263
So I’ll see you tomorrow?

20:18.052 --> 20:19.612
I’ll see you tomorrow.

20:29.268 --> 20:31.492
Jeez, you want me to
leave the whole bottle?

20:32.555 --> 20:34.655
They allow you to do that?

20:34.756 --> 20:36.685
Hey Jesse, three more please.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.029
Jesus Christ, the two of you.

20:41.317 --> 20:43.717
Well, I don’t know what your
problem is. It’s my birthday.

20:44.886 --> 20:46.549
I—I have no excuse.

20:47.979 --> 20:49.179
Lemme guess.

20:50.179 --> 20:51.379
Forty…

20:51.683 --> 20:54.356
married, marketing, with two kids.

20:55.575 --> 20:56.690
Thirty eight…

20:56.785 --> 21:00.104
Stripper/Waitress but was
“born” to be a singer.

21:00.424 --> 21:01.999
Fuck you, I’m a teacher!

21:02.035 --> 21:03.595
No no, I was talking about me.

21:04.750 --> 21:06.622
You wanna see a dance?
It’s a 100 bucks.

21:06.684 --> 21:08.103
They wouldn’t give you 30.

21:08.118 --> 21:09.326
No, you haven’t seen my moves.

21:09.354 --> 21:11.154
Ok, alright, now you’re creeping me out.

21:11.211 --> 21:13.031
— I’m Steve.
— Alice.

21:13.773 --> 21:15.981
Wow, you’re goin’ pretty big
for a school night, Alice.

21:16.070 --> 21:18.263
— It’s my birthday.
— Oh right, right.

21:18.419 --> 21:19.838
Well actually, tomorrow.

21:19.860 --> 21:22.264
So they just give you a day off,
you know, for your birthday,

21:22.283 --> 21:24.608
or do you have to lie, tell the kids
you’ve got a stomach bug?

21:24.632 --> 21:27.632
Okay, first off, I resent the implication
that I can’t hold my liquor…

21:27.874 --> 21:32.247
And secondly, we watch videos
sometimes for the first two periods.

21:32.279 --> 21:34.099
Just sometimes, right?

21:34.167 --> 21:35.862
Smart.
— So?…

21:36.292 --> 21:37.492
What’s your story?

21:37.940 --> 21:40.340
What brings you to our booming metropolis?

21:40.519 --> 21:43.649
Oh, I’m actually from a small town myself
so it just kind of feels like home.

21:43.696 --> 21:46.110
— Oh yeah, where’s that?
— Eldridge, Iowa.

21:46.157 --> 21:48.647
Aah, you’re a buckeye!

21:48.958 --> 21:50.518
That’s Ohio.

21:52.129 --> 21:52.925
The same thing.

21:52.956 --> 21:54.697
— Okay, no offense taken.
— Alice.

21:55.516 --> 21:56.758
Let’s go!

21:57.977 --> 22:00.365
Hey, what are we doing?
We’re drinking or not?

22:01.957 --> 22:03.263
Nice to meet you, Alice.

22:03.927 --> 22:08.043
Oh, so you’re not gonna even
buy a birthday girl a birthday drink?

22:09.140 --> 22:11.540
No, I think that would
communicate the wrong thing.

22:12.102 --> 22:13.848
You’re an asshole!

22:13.896 --> 22:15.987
No no, I’m—of course I’ll buy your drinks.

22:15.999 --> 22:18.004
No, forget it, you blew it,
you missed your chance.

22:18.028 --> 22:19.379
Wait! No, that’s it?

22:19.958 --> 22:21.418
Alice, come on.

22:21.582 --> 22:23.142
So how long you be in town?

22:24.551 --> 22:27.306
— Uh, yeah a bit.
— A bit?

22:27.697 --> 22:29.858
Oh my God, you’re a horrible liar.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.241
I’m not lying!

22:32.084 --> 22:34.340
You wanna give a girl
a real birthday present?

22:35.514 --> 22:36.746
Sure. Yeah.

22:37.246 --> 22:39.478
Jesse, we’re playing Absolut Madness.

22:42.687 --> 22:44.333
Absolut Madness?

22:44.533 --> 22:46.038
What’s Absolut Madness?

22:46.051 --> 22:47.791
It’s pretty much what it sounds like.

22:47.828 --> 22:50.732
You and Jesse drink 4 shots in 4 minutes,

22:50.746 --> 22:54.275
and if you can get closer to the
bulls eye on that dartboard, then

22:54.288 --> 22:57.345
we drink for free and you get
your Polaroid on the wall.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.837
Uh, that’s not at all what
it sounds like. alright, I’m in!

23:02.486 --> 23:05.343
Uh, no, I tell you what, okay,
hang on, what if we double?

23:05.358 --> 23:08.341
Alright, I do 8 shots in
8 minutes and if I win,

23:08.371 --> 23:10.591
everybody at this bar
gets the drink for free.

23:13.537 --> 23:16.793
— Alright.
— Alright, alright, alright, alright.

23:17.090 --> 23:19.962
— Hey, my name’s Steve, uh…
— Steve!

23:20.001 --> 23:22.905
I hope that we gonna get everybody
here drunk tonight for free.

23:26.804 --> 23:29.604
Alright, Absolute Madness, here we go.

23:35.701 --> 23:37.101
Oh my God!

23:40.933 --> 23:42.753
I got it, I got it!

23:50.355 --> 23:54.845
Oh! Oh thank God, you’re still…
kind of handsome.

23:56.582 --> 23:58.499
— You’re late.
— What?

23:58.642 --> 24:01.642
Your phone hasn’t stop buzzing
for the last half hour.

24:04.441 --> 24:05.561
Shit.

24:08.814 --> 24:10.056
Oh, shit, okay.

24:16.589 --> 24:18.389
I had a really great time.

24:18.499 --> 24:19.699
Did you?

24:20.360 --> 24:22.356
Uh, yeah, yeah, I mean…

24:23.184 --> 24:24.744
Nothing happened, Steve.

24:25.570 --> 24:29.306
Well, actually you did kiss me
before you threw up the first time.

24:29.528 --> 24:32.471
Oh, it’s gross.
Sorry.

24:32.627 --> 24:36.227
I was gonna let you sleep in your car, but
you couldn’t remember which one was yours.

24:36.530 --> 24:38.531
Uh. No, I didn’t drive.

24:38.808 --> 24:41.808
Well then it’s a good thing
I didn’t let you sleep in your car.

24:43.930 --> 24:44.890
Uh. Wow,

24:44.960 --> 24:46.810
can—can I take your number, or…?

24:46.933 --> 24:49.665
Well, you—you’re gonna be
“around for a bit”, right?

24:50.509 --> 24:51.469
Uh—

24:52.219 --> 24:55.227
It’s not that big of a town.
You’ll see me again.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.255
Okay. Still…

24:57.614 --> 24:59.754
The front door is, uh…?
— At the front of the house.

24:59.947 --> 25:01.799
When you get to it,
you’re gonna see a knob.

25:01.838 --> 25:03.799
— Okay.
— You turn that knob—

25:03.822 --> 25:06.163
Yeah, yeah. Too early for that, I’m just—

25:06.936 --> 25:09.054
Thank you.
— You’re welcome.

25:09.921 --> 25:12.004
Huh. happy birthday!

25:48.541 --> 25:50.398
What do you mean you were burned?

25:52.027 --> 25:54.163
Why were you using an iron?

25:55.585 --> 25:57.145
So he asked you to do it?

25:59.634 --> 26:02.968
No, I highly doubt it’s burned off, Danny.
What did the nurse say?

26:04.445 --> 26:06.245
Throwing hand or catching hand?

26:07.410 --> 26:09.210
So you’re gonna play this weekend?

26:10.001 --> 26:12.136
— Just five minutes.
— What you mean pitching?

26:12.316 --> 26:15.532
Danny! When did the coach
say that, that’s fantastic?!

26:16.735 --> 26:18.740
No no no, that was just Steve,
I’m at work.

26:23.741 --> 26:27.887
Okay. Folks, if you can find your seats
please, we’ll get started. Thank you.

26:28.152 --> 26:29.691
I can’t believe you went out.

26:30.079 --> 26:32.095
We didn’t get home from dinner till 9:30.

26:33.065 --> 26:35.811
She was very cool actually,
I think you would have liked her.

26:36.266 --> 26:39.031
I don’t think you should be making
statements like that just yet.

26:39.601 --> 26:41.591
Some of you may even
have family or friends

26:41.598 --> 26:43.856
who have had natural gas
come to their town.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.180
Name?

26:45.612 --> 26:46.732
Alice.

26:47.581 --> 26:48.701
Alice?

26:50.183 --> 26:52.003
Was she elderly?

26:52.290 --> 26:54.842
.. that we will be bringing
natural gas to McKinley.

27:02.236 --> 27:04.036
How do they get the gas?

27:04.721 --> 27:07.461
Ah! Frank, how are ya?
Listen—

27:08.124 --> 27:09.244
What is that?

27:09.601 --> 27:11.001
Lemonade.

27:11.872 --> 27:13.067
Is it good?

27:13.145 --> 27:16.444
It’s fantastic. It’s fresh squeezed.
There’s a kid selling it out there.

27:16.483 --> 27:18.658
She’s cleaning up! You want some?

27:19.145 --> 27:20.265
No.

27:22.112 --> 27:28.047
There are these rock deposits underground.
Deep, under—miles underground.

27:28.203 --> 27:32.200
And they create these drills
that go down 2 or 3 miles,

27:32.365 --> 27:36.644
and the breaking of that shale
is what actually releases the gas.

27:36.684 --> 27:38.815
— It’s called Fracking.
— Excuse me?

27:39.253 --> 27:41.174
The process. It’s called Fracking.

27:41.250 --> 27:42.907
That’s right. That’s right.

27:42.940 --> 27:45.414
Frank, now if you’d let me finish
please, we have a basket to—

27:45.445 --> 27:48.267
I would encourage all of
you when you go home

27:48.268 --> 27:50.849
to Google that word and
see what you find.

27:51.114 --> 27:53.815
Unfortunately, it’s not nearly as simple

27:53.816 --> 27:56.838
as what Supervisor Richards
has just laid out.

27:56.876 --> 28:00.616
Frank. Frank, I’m sure we all appreciate
the point you’re trying to make,

28:00.640 --> 28:03.192
but there’s no decision to be made here.
We need this.

28:03.446 --> 28:07.986
I’m sorry. I’m sorry, but…
uh, this thing here.

28:08.618 --> 28:13.436
It may not be the saving
grace you all want it to be.

28:14.241 --> 28:16.684
Now, Gerry started
this thing on by saying

28:16.720 --> 28:20.764
Natural Gas coming here
is life saving. And it is!

28:21.236 --> 28:23.718
It’s a clean and efficient resource.

28:24.103 --> 28:27.929
But the way we go about getting it
is some dirty business.

28:27.964 --> 28:30.258
Franck, with all due respect,
I think you’re out of your league.

28:30.283 --> 28:32.532
And the potential for
error is just too high.

28:32.602 --> 28:33.532
Thank you Frank.

28:33.594 --> 28:38.076
And There are people all over the country,
who’s water has been contaminated.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.707
Okay. Frank, I have absolutely
had enough of this.

28:40.730 --> 28:44.238
We don’t have to have this conversation
here. If you wanna come down to—

28:44.274 --> 28:45.474
Goddamn it.

28:46.353 --> 28:50.889
I’m late here, sorry. I’m sorry, uh,
I don’t mean to interrupt you, Mr…?

28:51.202 --> 28:52.402
Yates.

28:53.363 --> 28:54.923
My name is Frank Yates.

28:55.164 --> 28:58.724
Uh, Mr. Yates, are you with a,
uh, an environmental group?

28:59.583 --> 29:00.543
No.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.485
No? Uh, what line of work you in, Sir?

29:05.807 --> 29:07.711
I’m a teacher at the high school.

29:07.761 --> 29:08.961
A teacher.

29:09.351 --> 29:10.911
I teach science.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.884
What about you, Mrrrrrrrr?

29:14.915 --> 29:17.015
Okay. Yeah. Well, I deserve that.

29:17.069 --> 29:18.848
Uh, well, Steve Butler is my name.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.736
I’m a consultant, here, with Global.

29:21.861 --> 29:24.171
I only caught the tail end
of what you were saying, but

29:24.188 --> 29:28.163
you seem like someone
who’s done his homework.

29:28.412 --> 29:32.128
Could I ask you though, where
did you get your information?

29:32.606 --> 29:37.283
Mr. Butler, you and I both know
the information I’ve been talking about,

29:37.457 --> 29:40.025
is vast and detailed.

29:40.111 --> 29:41.944
You’re probably right, I’m certainly—

29:41.999 --> 29:43.559
I’m not the guy with all the answers.

29:43.738 --> 29:48.879
Oh, well then you’d be the perfect guy for
them to send here, to deny everything.

29:49.823 --> 29:56.266
Well look, I’m not gonna deny that this
issue has been made pretty complicated by

29:56.501 --> 30:00.623
a few companies who’ve had
their fair share of incidents. But

30:01.258 --> 30:04.302
we’ve been fracking in this
country for over 50 years.

30:04.602 --> 30:08.342
This is not a new issue,
this is not a new technology.

30:08.522 --> 30:11.562
But Global is being sued,
isn’t that true, Steve?

30:12.012 --> 30:13.579
Yeah, that’s true, that’s true.

30:13.580 --> 30:17.288
Just like any other company our size
in any other industry.

30:17.457 --> 30:20.072
And the way we handle those
law suits is we stand up to ‘em.

30:20.159 --> 30:22.344
Because we’re not in the business
of handing out free money.

30:22.367 --> 30:24.648
to people who make
false claims against us.

30:24.872 --> 30:28.088
And the thing—the take away here,
is how many times we’ve lost.

30:28.119 --> 30:31.118
And that’s none. We’ve never
ever lost any ot those case.

30:31.491 --> 30:34.491
Well, you can’t lose a game
that’s still being played.

30:35.795 --> 30:39.081
Look Steve, I’m sure that
even you can admit

30:39.120 --> 30:43.026
that Fracking is far
from a perfect process.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.293
Perfect?

30:46.333 --> 30:48.333
Of course not, uhm…

30:48.479 --> 30:53.211
But given the government regulations
that we have to adhere to

30:53.245 --> 30:56.742
and all the hoops we jump through,
it’s pretty close to perfect.

30:56.836 --> 31:01.607
The only reason why natural gas is
so big right now is because it finally is

31:01.639 --> 31:05.761
the clean alternative to these
dangerous industries like coal and oil.

31:05.793 --> 31:09.251
If it’s such an incredible
alternative why do they need a man

31:09.261 --> 31:13.706
standing off to the side of the
room to make sure we all go for it?

31:14.445 --> 31:16.845
Seems to me it should
be able to sell itself.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.724
But you’re not the man with
the answers. So who is?

31:20.480 --> 31:22.583
Because I still have questions.

31:23.239 --> 31:25.283
Well, I’d like to answer
all of those questions.

31:25.853 --> 31:26.973
But…

31:28.077 --> 31:30.840
I’d just like everybody to keep
something in mind here.

31:32.593 --> 31:35.255
There’s no such thing as
a neutral position here.

31:36.096 --> 31:41.148
If you’re against this,
you’re for coal and oil. Period.

31:42.075 --> 31:43.997
Ι mеаn, unlеѕѕ wе tаlk аbоut
сuttіng соnѕumрtіоn,

31:44.018 --> 31:46.354
and so far that’s a conversation
none of us wanna have.

31:46.893 --> 31:50.172
Steve, I just came here
to point out that this issue

31:50.470 --> 31:53.172
is a bit more complicated than it seems.

31:53.381 --> 31:55.816
Well, yeah, I mean
you’ve certainly done that.

31:55.972 --> 31:57.092
Well great.

31:57.210 --> 31:59.371
Now I think we should take a vote.

32:01.740 --> 32:03.140
A vote…?

32:04.756 --> 32:09.128
In a couple of weeks, when we’ve all had
time to think this whole thing through,

32:09.732 --> 32:11.354
I think we should put it to a vote.

32:11.410 --> 32:15.564
With all due respect, the people
in this town really need this.

32:15.970 --> 32:18.030
They—they need this. And…

32:18.352 --> 32:21.099
Quite frankly, I don’t think that…

32:21.779 --> 32:27.073
anybody here is gonna be
swayed by one man. Sorry.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.800
You’re right.

32:35.639 --> 32:39.714
These people and I came here
to say we strongly believe

32:39.847 --> 32:42.902
this is not in the best
interest of this town.

32:44.273 --> 32:45.233
Hey, Gerry.

32:45.286 --> 32:47.315
Gerry, I’m sorry, these kids
have regionals coming up.

32:47.339 --> 32:50.696
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Stan, sure thing,
go ahead. Uhm… Well…

32:51.083 --> 32:52.815
Look Frank, this isn’t everybody.

32:52.884 --> 32:54.928
I mean, not even half of
the town is here today.

32:54.998 --> 32:57.292
Exactly, And I think all those people

32:57.354 --> 33:00.253
would hate to be left out
of such an important decision.

33:00.301 --> 33:02.681
— Uh, Frank—
— Gerry, Gerry, let’s face it.

33:02.807 --> 33:08.312
We both know that money can
lead very often to bad decisions.

33:08.447 --> 33:10.327
Are you seeing the same numbers I have,

33:10.340 --> 33:16.486
and with the recent figures on deposits
in this area at 150 million dollars,

33:17.497 --> 33:19.808
let’s all take some time
to think it through.

33:21.225 --> 33:23.699
150 million dollars?

33:23.847 --> 33:26.847
Those are the latest numbers
out of the university.

33:28.118 --> 33:29.238
Well…

33:30.417 --> 33:33.572
150 million dollars is a lot of money.

33:35.143 --> 33:36.703
Let’s have a vote!

33:36.877 --> 33:38.437
Say, three weeks time.

33:38.632 --> 33:39.786
We’re adjourned!

33:40.026 --> 33:41.481
Asshole.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.650
— Holy shit!
— Okay, calm down.

33:53.704 --> 33:55.148
Don’t tell me to calm down!

33:55.842 --> 33:58.397
Natural gas isn’t perfect…

33:58.897 --> 34:00.233
What were you thinking?

34:01.721 --> 34:04.121
And that politician,
why is he so pissed off?

34:04.428 --> 34:07.816
Becau—because I told him that the
real number was 30 million dollars.

34:08.645 --> 34:09.766
I mean—
— Well,

34:09.809 --> 34:12.330
once again, you came in
below the price point.

34:12.362 --> 34:14.299
Was it worth it?
— I’m sorry.

34:15.502 --> 34:17.531
You know what Steven?
Listen to me.

34:18.094 --> 34:21.880
I don’t give a shit about your
numbers or your promotion.

34:22.091 --> 34:25.393
My kid is in fucking Houston
with his stupid fucking dad.

34:25.739 --> 34:27.745
This is a job, and then I go home.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.768
I’m sorry, Sue.

34:29.793 --> 34:32.790
Do not say ‘I’m sorry, Sue’ one more time.

34:36.455 --> 34:38.237
Alright, the plan’s the same.

34:39.442 --> 34:41.262
Nothing’s changed.

34:42.011 --> 34:43.524
But starting now…

34:44.179 --> 34:46.438
we—we—we close everyone!

34:47.204 --> 34:49.647
I don’t care if they can fit
1 well or 20 wells.

34:49.674 --> 34:52.351
We go door to door and we lease it all.

34:54.301 --> 34:55.859
They still need the money.

34:56.650 --> 34:59.874
The politician was buckling, Steven
stepped in to try to put the fire out.

34:59.906 --> 35:01.481
This Yates guy, he’s just a wild card.

35:01.536 --> 35:04.520
Yeah, the—he’s the high school
science teacher here. You know…

35:04.549 --> 35:06.656
Uh-Huh. Well, research pulled him up.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.673
He’s a hell of a lot
more than that, Steve!

35:08.787 --> 35:11.790
Frank Yates. MA, engineering, MIT.

35:12.017 --> 35:14.139
PhD from Cornell in Physics.

35:14.846 --> 35:18.554
Jesus Christ, the guy did R n’ D
for Boeing for 32 years,

35:18.637 --> 35:21.561
He’s retired, Steve!
He’s teaching for fun!

35:22.197 --> 35:24.548
Okay, we’re pulling it.
We’re pulling you now!

35:24.593 --> 35:25.819
— No!
— Absolutely not!

35:25.851 --> 35:28.919
They take us for somebody else in,
it looks like we’re running scared!

35:29.060 --> 35:30.606
Where is everybody?
Where did you go?

35:31.754 --> 35:34.962
I’m here. Uh, look, I—I can have this
whole place committed,

35:35.049 --> 35:37.429
and—and before this guy
gets one more supporter.

35:37.487 --> 35:39.960
Period. Okay, just give me the chance.

35:40.523 --> 35:42.997
I don’t have to tell you
how important all this is.

35:43.092 --> 35:44.145
This is all or nothing.

35:44.307 --> 35:46.433
— We understand each other?
— Yeah, I understand.

36:31.988 --> 36:33.297
Coffee, handsome?

36:33.353 --> 36:35.993
Ah. Uh yeah, two.
To go. Please.

36:36.021 --> 36:38.850
— Cream and sugar?
— Uh yeah, please.

36:45.818 --> 36:47.618
No, put that away, it’s on me.

36:48.128 --> 36:49.528
Thank you.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.535
Don’t you worry about
Frank Yates, darlin’.

36:51.613 --> 36:53.413
We all know it’s not true.

37:19.749 --> 37:23.377
Hey, did research say anything
about an environmental presence?

37:23.846 --> 37:25.820
No, none of the usual suspects.

37:25.974 --> 37:27.534
Nothing locally.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.987
— Uh, Mr. Yates?
— Yes?

37:40.128 --> 37:42.133
Hi. My name is Dustin Noble.

37:42.180 --> 37:45.162
I’m from a small environmental
group called Superior Athena.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.695
What can I do for you?

37:50.466 --> 37:53.801
I heard about the vote, and
I’d like to do anything I can to help.

37:54.026 --> 37:57.680
Oh well. Look, I…
I don’t think anybody here

37:58.284 --> 38:03.570
considers himself to be part of some
great environmental revolution, you know.

38:03.883 --> 38:07.013
I—I have a pretty good feeling
we can win this.

38:07.304 --> 38:11.176
Well, with all due respect, sir, you’ve picked
a much bigger fight than you think, so…

38:11.350 --> 38:12.910
you have to win.

38:13.926 --> 38:16.214
And I have the one thing you don’t…

38:17.388 --> 38:18.588
Evidence.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.767
Yeah. That’s it.

38:38.315 --> 38:41.344
Ah, your little store, is there
a storm coming I didn’t know about?

38:42.097 --> 38:44.497
We have to stay a little
longer than we thought.

38:45.597 --> 38:47.397
Not necessarily a bad thing.

38:48.189 --> 38:49.671
What happened to your window?

38:50.468 --> 38:54.332
Ah, I got into a bit of a heated
discussion last night at the bar.

38:54.523 --> 38:56.841
I’m assuming it’s not a coincidence.

38:56.898 --> 38:58.239
A heated discussion about what?

38:59.021 --> 39:00.417
You’re kidding.

39:00.449 --> 39:02.415
Don’t look worried.
I’m not gonna gunshot ‘em.

39:11.191 --> 39:12.479
Oh come on!

39:20.791 --> 39:22.541
— You sing?
— What?

39:23.479 --> 39:25.279
You look like you’d be a singer.

39:25.325 --> 39:26.549
What are you talking about?

39:26.604 --> 39:29.586
Hot girls I was in high school with,
who sang in the choir,

39:30.007 --> 39:32.056
they always had hair like yours.

39:33.290 --> 39:34.850
Well, I was in a church choir, but…

39:35.521 --> 39:38.983
Told you. It’s in the hair.
Just think about it.

39:39.272 --> 39:43.207
Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, Cher,
they all had good hair.

39:44.587 --> 39:48.127
It’s a very interesting theory, Rod,
but I don’t want to sing in public.

39:48.944 --> 39:49.780
What?

39:49.857 --> 39:52.857
I mean, what’s the point of having
good hair if you don’t sing in public?

39:54.372 --> 39:56.172
Women like Karaoke.

39:56.603 --> 39:59.569
We don’t call it that.
You know, it’s just open mic.

39:59.613 --> 40:02.774
You tell the band what you want
to sing, they play it, you sing.

40:03.978 --> 40:05.296
Not gonna happen.

40:15.479 --> 40:16.599
Excuse me!

40:16.841 --> 40:18.215
Hey. Hey!

40:18.349 --> 40:20.169
Excuse me, hey man!

40:27.987 --> 40:30.055
Hey! Hey! Hey buddy!

40:32.414 --> 40:33.562
Come on.

40:37.103 --> 40:38.503
Okay. Look.

40:38.543 --> 40:40.861
This whole door to door
thing just isn’t gonna cut it.

40:40.931 --> 40:42.314
I mean, if you wanna sell to these people,

40:42.326 --> 40:45.197
you gotta get ‘em all together
or not get ‘em at all.

40:45.582 --> 40:47.402
I mean, you’re a pro.

40:47.558 --> 40:49.958
I shouldn’t have to tell you this. Look…

40:50.340 --> 40:52.869
Show your face tonight,
make yourself seem friendly.

40:52.912 --> 40:54.712
Embarrass yourself a bit.

40:58.119 --> 40:59.819
Hey, did you see a guy in there?

41:00.192 --> 41:02.592
I’m gonna let you figure out
how stupid that sounded.

41:03.463 --> 41:05.601
I think there’s an environmental presence.

41:05.659 --> 41:06.413
Really?

41:06.492 --> 41:08.718
Well, I don’t know.
I mean—that guy, right there!

41:09.531 --> 41:11.435
I—I don’t know. Maybe.

41:11.888 --> 41:13.752
That’s okay, don’t panic,
we’ll figure it out.

41:14.338 --> 41:15.898
I gotta get an outfit.

41:20.664 --> 41:22.224
You think this guy is handsome?

41:22.473 --> 41:23.433
What?

41:23.503 --> 41:25.063
No, you just look nice.

41:25.907 --> 41:27.107
Oh, shut up.

41:27.670 --> 41:29.011
Ooh, buddy’s place.

41:29.808 --> 41:31.368
Scene of the crime.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.772
Is this where you tried
to pick up that lady?

41:34.061 --> 41:35.772
Alice. She’s very nice.

41:36.382 --> 41:39.123
— Hey, am I sitting with you?
— No, I’m sitting with Rob.

41:39.388 --> 41:41.831
— Who’s Rob?
— The handsome guy.

41:45.144 --> 41:46.104
Wait!

41:47.407 --> 41:49.123
What song are you gonna sing?

42:02.236 --> 42:03.356
Sue!

42:07.117 --> 42:08.517
— Hey.
— Hey.

42:11.832 --> 42:14.285
I signed you up.
You’re ready?

42:15.752 --> 42:16.872
Nice!

42:18.546 --> 42:21.346
I’m not entirely sure
you should be drinking.

42:21.654 --> 42:22.614
Hey!

42:23.323 --> 42:24.283
Alice.

42:25.219 --> 42:26.779
Let’s try this again.

42:27.184 --> 42:27.767
Steve.

42:27.815 --> 42:31.283
— Steve, it’s very nice to meet you.
— Very nice to meet you, Alice.

42:32.575 --> 42:37.127
So. Looks like you’re gonna
stay around for a bit, after all.

42:37.612 --> 42:42.039
That, uhm… town hall meeting didn’t look
like it went the way you wanted it to.

42:42.313 --> 42:45.467
Yeah, we were only supposed
to be here for 2 or 3 days.

42:45.576 --> 42:47.553
Sorry I lied.
— That’s ok.

42:47.631 --> 42:50.019
We don’t actually play a game
called Absolut Madness.

42:50.068 --> 42:51.917
Jesse’s shots were water.

42:53.066 --> 42:54.626
What’s Absolut Madness?

42:56.447 --> 43:02.069
♪ I wandered so aimless,
♪ My life full of sins,

43:02.109 --> 43:06.567
♪ I wouldn’t let my dear savior in,

43:07.741 --> 43:10.067
In case of emergency only.

43:10.739 --> 43:12.299
See you around, Steve.

43:19.964 --> 43:21.364
Oh my God.

43:28.326 --> 43:30.527
♪ No sorrow in sight.

43:31.090 --> 43:35.784
♪ Praise the Lord, I saw the light.

43:36.368 --> 43:41.287
♪ I saw the light, I saw the light,

43:41.319 --> 43:45.848
♪ No more darkness, No more night,

43:45.903 --> 43:50.903
♪ Now I’m so happy,
♪ No sorrow in sight,

43:51.007 --> 43:55.614
♪ Praise the Lord, I saw the light.

43:56.185 --> 44:03.574
♪ Praise the Lord, I saw the light.

44:10.232 --> 44:11.352
No.

44:11.389 --> 44:13.850
Jesus, I thought that
would’ve gone better.

44:14.244 --> 44:16.492
Really? I thought it was great.

44:18.250 --> 44:21.083
Hey everybody. Uhm.
Check check.

44:21.568 --> 44:23.690
No. It’s not a good joke. Uh-uhm.

44:24.144 --> 44:27.048
It’s a much better idea when
I’m staying well on the back, uh—

44:27.111 --> 44:29.374
— Sing something, man!
— Oh God, definitely.

44:29.398 --> 44:31.653
Definitely you don’t want that.
Uh, I just wanted to introduce myself,

44:31.682 --> 44:34.117
I’m new in town, I just came in,
my name’s Dustin Noble,

44:34.156 --> 44:36.966
I work for a small environmental
company called Athena.

44:37.138 --> 44:40.825
And I—Yeah—No, I—
I know. I know.

44:40.894 --> 44:43.469
The reason why I wanted to talk to you
is that I’m actually from a small

44:43.511 --> 44:45.383
farming community myself in Nebraska,

44:45.413 --> 44:49.262
uh, my family’s 5th generation
in dairy, and uh,

44:50.468 --> 44:55.028
Well, the farm is gone,
everything we had is—is gone.

44:55.325 --> 44:58.971
What happened was, in 2008,
my dad found 12 dead cows

44:58.986 --> 45:01.710
down by a creek about a half
a mile from our house, and then,

45:01.738 --> 45:06.813
in April about 70% of those cows
were either sick or dead.

45:06.907 --> 45:11.397
And by Christmas he had defaulted on his
payments and the bank took his house.

45:11.749 --> 45:12.869
Hum…

45:12.928 --> 45:14.699
The land just died, it just…

45:15.144 --> 45:16.425
it just turned brown and died,

45:16.436 --> 45:18.894
and it made it very easy to see
the only things left standing,

45:18.904 --> 45:23.729
which were these giant green
wells that said ‘Global’ on them.

45:24.069 --> 45:25.926
Now these guys at Global,
they’re real clever.

45:25.965 --> 45:28.790
They have these fine prints
in the leases they make you sign,

45:28.822 --> 45:31.437
that says you can’t talk
about it in a court of law, but

45:31.777 --> 45:33.777
hell, I’m pretty sure they
don’t say anything about

45:33.784 --> 45:35.578
telling a couple of friends in a bar.

45:37.352 --> 45:41.638
We had a farm in our family for 150 years,
it only took nine months to lose it.

45:41.929 --> 45:43.559
So, I heard you were taking a vote,

45:43.595 --> 45:46.595
And I had to come down here
personally and tell you my story.

45:49.424 --> 45:51.824
This isn’t some
environmentalist conspiracy.

45:52.245 --> 45:53.766
This is our lives.

45:54.094 --> 45:56.258
Now it’s happened. And…

45:56.560 --> 45:59.862
hell, it’s happened to one of us…
it can happen to all of us.

45:59.899 --> 46:03.967
So I guess I’m just here to say my name
is Dustin Noble, and I’m here for you, so

46:04.014 --> 46:05.972
take one of these pamphlets
on the way out, okay.

46:06.012 --> 46:08.112
Thanks a lot. Thank you
very much, I appreciate.

46:09.605 --> 46:10.938
Oh Yanks, no.

46:11.649 --> 46:12.883
No, wow wow wow.

46:12.899 --> 46:14.943
You have no idea how hard that song is.

46:15.059 --> 46:17.181
That is way higher than you think. No!

46:18.369 --> 46:19.489
Really?

46:20.632 --> 46:22.032
Okay, uh…

46:22.403 --> 46:26.275

♪ I could use just a little help,

46:56.109 --> 46:58.317

to do this, I need the help, so

let’s do it for real.
Everybody up, let’s go!

47:05.029 --> 47:07.161

God, can we go inside, at least?
It’s fucking freezing out here.

47:45.092 --> 47:47.058
I mean, how we know the
guy’s even staying here?

47:47.223 --> 47:49.105
Where else would he stay, Steven?

47:49.298 --> 47:51.119
I mean, none of that shit
can be true, right?

47:51.143 --> 47:52.506
No, of course not.

47:52.655 --> 47:55.152
We would’ve heard about it.
They’re not gonna send us in blind.

47:55.176 --> 47:57.207
I should have just
confronted him at the bar.

47:57.754 --> 48:00.833
In front of the whole town?
On open mic night?

48:02.314 --> 48:04.658
Okay. Hello.

48:05.678 --> 48:06.597
Hey!

48:06.690 --> 48:08.417
Play nice.
— I got it, I got it.

48:14.358 --> 48:15.721
Hey man! What’s going on?

48:15.778 --> 48:18.456
— Hey, how is it going?
— Good. Good. What are you doing here?

48:19.995 --> 48:21.120
What’s that?

48:21.292 --> 48:22.252
What…

48:22.431 --> 48:23.391
are…

48:23.446 --> 48:25.006
you doing here?

48:25.255 --> 48:28.608
I mean, Athena? I’ve never even heard of
that company. What kind of name is that?

48:28.839 --> 48:30.291
Uh, it’s Greek, originally.

48:30.883 --> 48:33.607
— Athena is the goddess of—
— Dude, I fucking know who Athena is!

48:33.795 --> 48:37.081
Okay. ‘Cause you just—you
just said you didn’t.

48:37.580 --> 48:39.199
I’m sorry, who are you?

48:39.880 --> 48:43.202
— Are you joking? I’m Steve.
— Hi Steve.

48:43.223 --> 48:46.380
Yeah. I’m the guy you were just talking
shit about at open mic night!

48:46.490 --> 48:49.224
— Oh wow! You’re from Global.
— Yeah. Yeah.

48:49.732 --> 48:52.956
Because you know who you’re dealing with
here, I mean is this like a joke to you?

48:53.171 --> 48:55.660
I mean is this some game for you
and your stoner buddies, that—

48:55.674 --> 48:58.640
Yeah. Oh I know exactly
who I’m dealing with.

48:59.093 --> 49:00.493
Steve Butler.

49:02.220 --> 49:04.020
See, I know everything about your company.

49:04.676 --> 49:07.448
I know what you do… and how to beat it.

49:08.208 --> 49:10.698
You know how to beat—
wait, no okay, by—by—by—

49:10.877 --> 49:14.351
by telling bullshit sob stories
and singing fucking Springsteen?

49:14.422 --> 49:16.833
— Listen, you seem really nice kid,
— you gotta be kidding me.

49:16.863 --> 49:19.759
that doesn’t understand that
he is in way oversale on this one.

49:21.232 --> 49:25.253
We’ve already signed more than enough
leases to start development on this town,

49:25.293 --> 49:28.017
you’re too late!
— I wouldn’t underestimate these people.

49:28.041 --> 49:29.441
I don’t.

49:31.478 --> 49:33.960
I know you think what
you’re doing is right,

49:34.245 --> 49:36.654
and I really admire that commitment.

49:37.141 --> 49:39.686
But your presence here
only confuses people.

49:41.086 --> 49:43.458
But, we appreciate what you’re doing,

49:43.539 --> 49:46.505
and would like to make
a donation to your organization.

49:46.660 --> 49:49.325
Your cooperation is valuable to us.

49:50.411 --> 49:52.109
You gotta be kidding me.

50:20.097 --> 50:21.217
God.

50:46.700 --> 50:49.510
Okay. Get it. Get it! You pull on
the brake, you pull on the brake.

50:52.564 --> 50:55.364
It’s stupid, it doesn’t even make sense.

51:04.206 --> 51:05.562
Brake. Yeah, I got it.

51:15.054 --> 51:16.755
Okay, check out the horses.

51:19.128 --> 51:20.688
They do seem small.

51:20.833 --> 51:22.502
Next to the goats. Right?

51:23.251 --> 51:25.135
Yeah, they should be
bigger next to the goats.

51:25.159 --> 51:27.977
— Right?
— You’re right! I mean, that…

51:28.215 --> 51:30.611
You know, unless—unless the goats are big.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.267
Come on. Those goats are normal!

51:35.465 --> 51:36.665
Holy shit!

51:37.440 --> 51:39.455
— What?
— Holy shit!

51:41.822 --> 51:43.851
What is going on here?

51:44.117 --> 51:47.763
— Global, go home.
— Global go—Oh, son of a bitch.

51:48.497 --> 51:49.897
He made signs?

51:51.549 --> 51:53.901
Pull o—no, there he is.

51:56.523 --> 51:59.364
I’ll be around, so let me know
if you need anything. Thank you.

51:59.533 --> 52:01.013
What are you doing, man?

52:01.132 --> 52:02.380
Hey, Steve!

52:04.486 --> 52:05.606
Hey!

52:05.956 --> 52:06.916
Hello!

52:10.034 --> 52:11.696
What the fuck are you doing?

52:12.622 --> 52:14.690
Well, I’m telling these people the truth.

52:14.916 --> 52:16.604
Hang on, we had an agreement, pal.

52:17.115 --> 52:18.075
Did we?

52:18.523 --> 52:20.523
Yeah, we sure as shit did.

52:21.714 --> 52:24.071
Listen Steve, I came here for a reason.

52:24.095 --> 52:25.688
Oh my God, what?

52:25.898 --> 52:27.927
— I gotta do what I came here to do.
— Okay.

52:30.314 --> 52:32.616
— You took our money.
— Yeah.

52:33.083 --> 52:36.350
Oh but I did put that donation
to good use, so thank you. Hey sue!

52:37.175 --> 52:38.672
Okay, if it’s all a joke, great.

52:38.698 --> 52:40.743
Do you have any idea what
you’re dealing with there?

52:40.774 --> 52:42.558
We are a 9 billion dollar company.

52:43.045 --> 52:45.011
Okay, do you know what we’re capable of?

52:45.449 --> 52:46.409
Do you?

52:47.283 --> 52:49.683
’Cause all I see here
is you and me, Steve.

52:50.518 --> 52:53.518
And one of us is a lot more
confident than the other one.

52:54.110 --> 52:57.710
One of us is going to get
punched in the fucking face.

52:58.256 --> 53:02.527
Steve look, I know this must be really
frustrating for you, and I’m sorry.

53:02.586 --> 53:05.435
You’re doing all the things you’ve done in
the past, it’s just not working this time.

53:05.459 --> 53:08.870
It’s not work—I have 60% of
this land bought and paid for.

53:09.034 --> 53:10.527
It’s over.
— Steve,

53:10.582 --> 53:14.384
you can have 80% of this land bought.
That’s only 40% of the vote.

53:14.813 --> 53:17.904
We’re not fighting for the land, Steve,
we’re fighting for the people.

53:18.686 --> 53:20.785
You’re fucking at—the—
these people need help.

53:20.824 --> 53:22.251
Okay? I’m here to give it to them.
— Steven!

53:22.298 --> 53:24.392
— What are you doing?
— Steve, you’re wrong.

53:24.509 --> 53:26.609
Right? These people have changed.

53:26.688 --> 53:29.459
It’s not just about the money any more.
— Get in the car, Steven.

53:29.506 --> 53:32.310
Listen, none of this is
your fault, okay? It’s just…

53:32.874 --> 53:34.074
It’s just time!

53:34.333 --> 53:37.637
Just time for what?
For what, man, what are you selling?

53:38.026 --> 53:39.826
Look at you!
— I’ll see you around, Steve.

53:41.055 --> 53:44.951
Yeah, let’s just run everything on—
on rainbows and—and happy thoughts.

53:45.586 --> 53:46.669
Fucking dip shit.

53:52.898 --> 53:54.298
God damn.

53:55.786 --> 53:58.432
I mean, like, what is his
truck running at, right?

53:58.471 --> 54:00.666
Bio fuel. Okay?

54:00.776 --> 54:03.576
— Is it really?
— Yes! Like french frie grease.

54:21.144 --> 54:22.344
Asshole.

54:49.810 --> 54:52.156
Well, hello!
My name’s Dustin!

54:52.237 --> 54:55.159
— Hi Dustin.
— So well behaved.

54:55.663 --> 54:57.463
How many guys live on a farm?

54:57.870 --> 55:00.348
Wow! Alright, me too!

55:00.398 --> 55:03.043
And guess what?
This is my farm.

55:03.295 --> 55:05.113
— It’s not real farm.
— What?

55:07.230 --> 55:09.516
There’s a ton of them there.
We should just start there.

55:09.681 --> 55:10.991
Fine, wherever.

55:19.511 --> 55:21.065
Goddammit!

55:29.221 --> 55:33.033
Pretend that this is the dirt
underneath my farm. Alright?

55:33.162 --> 55:35.948
And this is all the water that we had.

55:36.089 --> 55:40.063
All the water we had to drink,
all the water the cows had to drink,

55:40.221 --> 55:42.773
all the water the puppies
and kittens had to drink,

55:42.949 --> 55:45.351
all the water for the fish in the rivers.

55:51.059 --> 55:52.645
— Hey there sir, good afternoon.
— Huh.

55:52.675 --> 55:54.174
Can I have a moment of your time?

55:54.393 --> 55:57.471
I know why you’re here.
And we don’t need it.

55:57.963 --> 56:01.893
We they do start drilling, they go
right in the ground. Like this.

56:02.424 --> 56:04.328
Right? Seems pretty simple.

56:04.464 --> 56:06.321
Well, they don’t have really cool drills

56:06.338 --> 56:08.188
like some of your dads
do in their garage.

56:08.315 --> 56:12.226
They have huge big ones like this.

56:12.821 --> 56:14.037
Hey, there he is.

56:15.339 --> 56:16.547
Hey!

56:17.438 --> 56:19.375
Hey I’ve been waiting
all day for you folks!

56:20.568 --> 56:21.870
Uh…

56:22.183 --> 56:23.880
Sorry I don’t think, uh…

56:24.708 --> 56:27.821
Yeah, Paul Geary. 442 Henley!

56:29.793 --> 56:33.142
Yeah, come on in, man, come on up,
hey I got some coffee brewing.

56:33.532 --> 56:35.632
Yup, there you are, I got you. Okay.

56:36.801 --> 56:40.072
In order to use a drill this big,
it needs a little help. So,

56:40.121 --> 56:44.556
they’re shooting all this water and all
this sand into the ground with the drill!

56:44.706 --> 56:49.477
And with all that,
they also shoot chemicals.

56:51.054 --> 56:52.609
No, doesn’t look scary?

56:52.664 --> 56:55.200
Okay, great. So what I’m gonna do,
I’ll just leave that with you and—

56:55.224 --> 56:58.253
and just read that over, just look—
— Oh hey, I’ll sign it right now.

56:58.362 --> 57:01.266
No no, well you should read it over,
and I’m gonna come back.

57:01.297 --> 57:03.484
I’m gonna be in town for a couple of days.

57:03.560 --> 57:05.833
They don’t just use one chemical.

57:05.990 --> 57:10.128
They use all of ‘em,
all at the same time,

57:10.175 --> 57:12.672
and some chemicals,
they don’t even tell us about.

57:12.767 --> 57:13.887
So,

57:14.071 --> 57:17.842
when they go to do that drilling,
let me show you what happens.

57:20.483 --> 57:24.496
— It’s dirty!
— Oh gross, what is that?

57:24.590 --> 57:26.650
Hey, let me ask you something?

57:27.221 --> 57:28.695
What d’you think?

57:29.313 --> 57:30.406
What d’you mean?

57:30.516 --> 57:32.343
Well I mean, the well, what I mean.

57:32.422 --> 57:35.224
So when they finally start drilling,
there’s no way to tell

57:35.295 --> 57:37.300
where all those chemicals are gonna go.

57:37.355 --> 57:40.790
So they start mixing with the dirt
and the sand and the water,

57:40.852 --> 57:42.652
You think it’s gonna be a gusher?

57:42.682 --> 57:44.148
Is that what you call it, a gusher?

57:44.195 --> 57:46.739
Well, we’re gonna have to do
some test, and—and you know,

57:46.772 --> 57:47.754
there’s a whole process
— No, come on,

57:47.770 --> 57:48.566
— we’re gonna go through.
— now!

57:48.615 --> 57:51.222
I’m not tellin’ ‘bout tests.
Between me and you?

57:51.300 --> 57:52.860
We’re gonna be partners?

57:53.173 --> 57:56.399
Come on, you could tell me, I ain’t gonna
tell nobody. What’s your gut feeling?

57:56.460 --> 57:57.580
Uh…

57:58.467 --> 58:00.410
Uhm… you really seem like a lucky guy.

58:00.518 --> 58:01.478
Yeah.

58:02.749 --> 58:05.863
Whoo! Yeah! That’s what
I’m talking about!

58:05.911 --> 58:06.926
Alright!
— Yeah.

58:06.965 --> 58:08.848
— We ‘preciate you guys comin’ by, ‘right?
— Thank you.

58:09.008 --> 58:10.974
You want me to show you how bad it is

58:10.998 --> 58:15.191
to have all that dirty water come back up
to the land in a pretty farm like mine?

58:15.800 --> 58:17.961
Let’s take a look.
Hey, let me show you.

58:18.016 --> 58:20.071
— Oh no, that’s—I don’t think—
— Don’t worry, I got it.

58:20.087 --> 58:22.165
— Uhm…
— Trust me. Alright, ready?

58:23.700 --> 58:25.338
Wow!

58:25.381 --> 58:27.299
Wait wait wait.
Why do you think it’s cool?

58:27.379 --> 58:30.087
Come on guys, we had all
these beautiful animals like cows,

58:30.119 --> 58:32.486
and horses, and chickens,

58:32.569 --> 58:35.361
we even have turtles.
What’s this guy’s name?

58:35.533 --> 58:37.887
— Trigger!
— This is Trigger?

58:38.395 --> 58:39.606
Hey Trigger.

58:39.650 --> 58:43.299
Now, do you think Trigger
can survive in my farm?

58:43.471 --> 58:45.338
— No.
— You don’t think so?

58:45.383 --> 58:47.183
— No.
— Right, let’s try it.

58:47.199 --> 58:49.353
NO!!

58:50.244 --> 58:53.343
God, Dad! We struck it big, right here!

58:53.390 --> 58:55.416
Huh? This little two acre lot!

58:55.447 --> 58:56.788
Alright, there you go, take one.

58:56.830 --> 58:58.312
Stick ‘em anywhere you
can, get in trouble.

58:58.329 --> 58:59.969
No. Don’t get in trouble.

59:00.164 --> 59:02.279
Alright, so I will—I will see you around.

59:02.310 --> 59:03.122
Great.

59:04.786 --> 59:06.466
— Alright. Bye.
— See ya.

59:08.393 --> 59:10.258
Damn, that’s your birthday everyday,

59:10.265 --> 59:11.508
— Oh, stop it.
— isn’t it?

59:13.281 --> 59:15.081
— What’s he got?
— 1.8 acres.

59:15.905 --> 59:17.246
How much?

59:17.364 --> 59:20.629
5000. And I told him 15%.

59:22.173 --> 59:23.373
Smart.

59:23.878 --> 59:24.975
Let’s just go.

59:25.054 --> 59:28.405
Oh come on, the guy’s
gonna get a free 5000 bucks.

59:31.382 --> 59:32.942
Shit. Don’t say anything!

59:42.858 --> 59:43.894
Hello.

59:45.590 --> 59:47.236
— Two dollars.
— Yeah. Lynn.

59:50.103 --> 59:52.710
.. So I wake up, 6 a.m. on the ground,

59:52.741 --> 59:54.871
I was on the ground, I didn’t know I fell.

59:54.918 --> 59:57.018
Just like this. All the way down, bang!

59:58.346 --> 01:00:00.376
I kidd you not! I kidd you not!

01:00:00.438 --> 01:00:02.476
Wooh! Ma’am, thank you,
I’m gonna bounce at it.

01:00:02.524 --> 01:00:04.468
Steve! There he is!
— Good morning.

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:07.490
Wow wow, you alright, Adam?
Me animals lost him.

01:00:07.574 --> 01:00:10.837
It’s not that funny, my God! But you
make me feel good, I’m not gonna lie.

01:00:10.993 --> 01:00:12.884
Yeah great, so I’m the bad guy.

01:00:13.095 --> 01:00:15.959
I mean, never mind the fact
that we use it. Here, I got it.

01:00:16.241 --> 01:00:20.504
You know we spend a billion dollars a day
to freight for that stuff, overseas?

01:00:20.676 --> 01:00:24.298
When we got this huge resource right here
in our backyard, I mean that’s insane.

01:00:24.393 --> 01:00:25.992
Now I got to deal with
some hippie running around.

01:00:26.006 --> 01:00:27.547
I mean I don’t even know
what that guy’s saying.

01:00:27.578 --> 01:00:29.536
Mr. Butler, you ain’t gonna hold it.

01:00:30.638 --> 01:00:31.755
Listen…

01:00:31.968 --> 01:00:34.005
You seem like a nice enough man, so

01:00:34.108 --> 01:00:36.809
I’m gonna be straight with you,
so as to not waste your time.

01:00:37.556 --> 01:00:39.051
That little boy right there?

01:00:39.504 --> 01:00:43.653
He lost his father, my brother,
6 years ago in Fallujah, so,

01:00:43.847 --> 01:00:47.172
you ain’t gonna lecture me on the
whole foreign oil dependency routine.

01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:50.504
But let me ask you a question, Steve.

01:00:50.972 --> 01:00:52.532
If I do this…

01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:54.786
what I’m gonna tell that boy?

01:00:55.736 --> 01:01:00.022
What am I telling him about this farm that
my daddy gave me and his daddy gave him?

01:01:01.078 --> 01:01:04.678
What am I telling him about what his
daddy went to the desert to fight for?

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.778
See, Steve,

01:01:06.943 --> 01:01:11.414
you and I both know that the only
reason you’re here, is ‘cause we’re poor.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.652
How many wells you got up near Manhattan?

01:01:15.406 --> 01:01:16.606
Or Pittsburgh?

01:01:18.019 --> 01:01:20.119
How ‘bout Philadelphia? Huh?

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:24.103
It’s okay. I get it.

01:01:25.044 --> 01:01:27.641
Gооd. Τhаt’ѕ whаt Ι ѕuрроѕе
yоu’rе hеrе fоr, rіght?

01:01:29.648 --> 01:01:30.848
You ‘bout ready, Blake?

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.161
Listen, Steve…

01:01:35.724 --> 01:01:38.198
you ain’t never get what you
came here to take from me.

01:01:38.857 --> 01:01:42.667
To be honest with you, I don’t even
like the fact that you’re here trying.

01:01:46.305 --> 01:01:47.538
Two minutes, Blake!

01:01:48.671 --> 01:01:50.155
You can see yourself out.

01:02:15.865 --> 01:02:17.265
Turn around.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:43.049
Well… We definitely have the space.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:49.437
Food and games to the left, put the
animals and bathrooms to the right.

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:51.776
I bet we could even do
a tractor pull back there

01:02:51.796 --> 01:02:55.817
behind the ferris wheel right next
to the… you know, the whirly thing.

01:02:56.434 --> 01:02:58.525
That’s it, I mean what am I—
what am I missing?

01:02:58.783 --> 01:03:01.666
— I don’t know.
— Oh come on, Sue!

01:03:02.627 --> 01:03:05.195
I have never even been to a town fair.

01:03:05.617 --> 01:03:08.163
I’m not P.R., this is for
the back up team.

01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:09.835
We are the back up team!

01:03:11.356 --> 01:03:14.356
Trust me, you wanna win?
This is how you do it.

01:03:16.619 --> 01:03:18.924
Look, if we can’t sign
everyone to a lease,

01:03:18.999 --> 01:03:21.668
at least we let them know what
it feels like to have some money.

01:03:23.449 --> 01:03:25.269
Now what am I missing?

01:03:27.749 --> 01:03:29.569
Bouncy castles.

01:03:31.898 --> 01:03:33.194
Congratulations.

01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:35.490
You just got a job in P.R.

01:04:47.852 --> 01:04:49.115
Well hello there.

01:04:53.767 --> 01:04:55.580
Are you the owner of this place?

01:04:55.723 --> 01:04:59.190
Oh good. We’re starting
in a field left out. Come on in.

01:05:06.983 --> 01:05:08.383
Quite a house.

01:05:08.803 --> 01:05:10.903
Yeah. For such a single lady.

01:05:11.433 --> 01:05:13.683
— I didn’t say that.
— Yeah, you didn’t have to.

01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:18.020
I was expecting that
it would have way more cats.

01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:24.705
No, that wasn’t really a big deal
for me to move back here.

01:05:25.565 --> 01:05:27.665
I was living in the city…

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:32.344
when my Dad died, they asked me
if I wanted to sell, and…

01:05:35.037 --> 01:05:38.066
You know, it had been in
my family for generations, and…

01:05:40.285 --> 01:05:42.853
I didn’t wanna be
the one that’d give it up.

01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:45.251
— It’s beautiful.
— Yeah.

01:05:48.905 --> 01:05:52.355
You know, according to our records,
you do have 82 acres up.

01:05:52.872 --> 01:05:55.283
I can give you a couple of tips
to boost your crop there.

01:05:55.315 --> 01:05:58.143
Right, that’s not for me,
that’s for my students.

01:05:58.182 --> 01:06:00.570
— Oh really?
— Yeah, I bring ‘em out here, and I…

01:06:00.727 --> 01:06:02.084
lock ‘em to the process.

01:06:02.865 --> 01:06:05.420
You’re teaching farming kids how to farm?

01:06:05.975 --> 01:06:08.160
I’m not teaching ‘em how to farm.

01:06:08.189 --> 01:06:10.650
Oh, I’m sorry. No, you’re teaching
farming kids how to garden.

01:06:10.665 --> 01:06:14.165
No, I’m teaching them
how to take care of something.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.040
Alright.

01:06:21.054 --> 01:06:22.598
Gimme me the pitch.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:24.575
You came all the way out here.

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:27.127
No, it’s getting late.

01:06:28.628 --> 01:06:30.994
— Are you serious?
— No, it’s a whole thing, I mean,

01:06:31.071 --> 01:06:33.623
you know, I have a
PowerPoint presentation,

01:06:33.756 --> 01:06:36.066
there’s an interpretative dance section,

01:06:36.136 --> 01:06:38.277
— takes a—takes a while.
— Gimme a little bit of it.

01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:40.907
Just the dance.
— I—I can come back.

01:07:04.566 --> 01:07:05.686
Hi.

01:07:13.039 --> 01:07:14.859
Someone told me…

01:07:15.524 --> 01:07:18.380
well, I heard you—you from Iowa,

01:07:19.428 --> 01:07:22.701
and your daddy,
your daddy he was a farmer.

01:07:23.465 --> 01:07:24.865
Grandfather.

01:07:25.504 --> 01:07:26.853
What’d you say?

01:07:27.579 --> 01:07:29.139
Doesn’t matter.

01:08:05.268 --> 01:08:07.531
So you got somethin’ to say?

01:08:08.587 --> 01:08:10.147
Right then say it!

01:08:10.428 --> 01:08:12.228
— Really?
— Yeah!

01:08:15.489 --> 01:08:19.560
You guys just fucking baffle me.
How you just don’t get it.

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:21.380
Yeah?

01:08:21.566 --> 01:08:23.345
Why don’t you tell me?

01:08:24.091 --> 01:08:26.907
’Cause I’m really curious about
what it is that I don’t get.

01:08:27.087 --> 01:08:28.198
Money.

01:08:29.313 --> 01:08:30.273
Money.

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:32.341
And I’m not talking about
little pay increases.

01:08:32.367 --> 01:08:34.270
I’m talking about “Fuck you” money.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:38.282
You don’t wanna apply for
college loans for your kid?

01:08:38.566 --> 01:08:40.813
This money says “Fuck you”, loans.

01:08:41.545 --> 01:08:44.144
You worried about car payments?
“Fuck you”, payments.

01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:47.008
The bank’s gonna come and
forclose on your family farm?

01:08:47.277 --> 01:08:48.837
“Fuck you”, bank.

01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:50.999
“Fuck you” money is the
ultimate liberator.

01:08:51.018 --> 01:08:52.968
And underneath your town
is “fuck you” money.

01:08:52.981 --> 01:08:55.981
So think long and hard about
all those brutal days workin’.

01:08:56.406 --> 01:08:58.028
And—and—and the goddamn checks you get

01:08:58.064 --> 01:09:00.778
from whatever frozen peas
company’s buying.

01:09:01.709 --> 01:09:03.652
Think about how much
you made on your best day,

01:09:03.685 --> 01:09:06.127
and then you think real hard about
how much you made on your worst.

01:09:06.162 --> 01:09:07.831
Cuz let’s be real honest with each other,

01:09:07.848 --> 01:09:10.314
they’re all looking like that
more and more nowadays, right?

01:09:11.502 --> 01:09:14.260
These people? This town? This life?

01:09:14.924 --> 01:09:17.211
It is dying or damn near dead.

01:09:17.568 --> 01:09:21.112
And you all see it coming, and you just
don’t get the fuck out of the way.

01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:22.620
Why?

01:09:23.474 --> 01:09:24.594
Why?

01:09:25.846 --> 01:09:27.648
Pride? Of what?

01:09:27.867 --> 01:09:29.426
What have you got?

01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:32.651
Shit, how much of it is even yours?
I bet all four of you are getting

01:09:32.684 --> 01:09:34.956
subsidy checks from the government. Right?

01:09:35.456 --> 01:09:38.538
Now, when they stop comin’,
When all that help stops comin’,

01:09:38.724 --> 01:09:41.844
and you’ve got nowhere to go,
you’re gonna remember this conversation,

01:09:41.926 --> 01:09:44.837
and remember the guy who came in
and looked you in the eye,

01:09:45.136 --> 01:09:46.229
and said “Fuck you”.

01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:50.301
You’re an asshole.

01:10:43.849 --> 01:10:45.669
Absolute Madness.

01:11:14.343 --> 01:11:15.303
Alice?

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:19.600
No, but I’m in room 23
if you’re desperate.

01:11:19.723 --> 01:11:20.923
Jesus, Sue…

01:11:22.809 --> 01:11:24.888
I just called to make sure
you’re behaving yourself,

01:11:24.915 --> 01:11:27.022
we got a big day tomorrow.
— Yeah. I got it.

01:11:27.138 --> 01:11:28.631
You gotta get some sleep, Steven.

01:11:28.767 --> 01:11:30.819
— I got it! I—
— because we have a big day tomorrow.

01:11:35.146 --> 01:11:36.346
Alice!

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.680
Thank you.

01:12:47.966 --> 01:12:49.086
Hello there.

01:12:52.617 --> 01:12:54.911
— Are you the owner of this place?
— No!

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:57.206
No? Well, how come
you’re doing all the work?

01:13:04.523 --> 01:13:06.786
— Set in stone, now.
— That’s it.

01:13:07.005 --> 01:13:08.739
— No turning back.
— No.

01:13:09.784 --> 01:13:11.955
Hey, hold on. I got something for you.

01:13:13.859 --> 01:13:15.349
Don’t jerk us all.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.114
With this, no Ma’am.

01:13:18.854 --> 01:13:22.320
Hey look, this right here, huh?
Special occasions.

01:13:23.008 --> 01:13:24.818
It’s only time it comes out.
— Yeah.

01:13:26.959 --> 01:13:29.513
Oh yeah. This right here, is good stuff.

01:13:31.222 --> 01:13:32.622
Thank you.

01:13:32.707 --> 01:13:34.527
Hey. Dustbin partners.

01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.053
I’ve been passing out these flyers for
two and a half hours, I’m gonna die.

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:41.660
I don’t know how that Athena guy does it.

01:13:43.926 --> 01:13:45.046
Got a donkey?

01:13:46.253 --> 01:13:48.807
Hey, where’re you going?
— Hell, dig out the courses.

01:13:49.563 --> 01:13:50.617
What courses?

01:13:50.915 --> 01:13:52.436
The pig races.

01:13:53.608 --> 01:13:56.740
I don’t like that you just said that
without a smile on your face.

01:13:56.996 --> 01:13:57.988
Are you okay?

01:13:58.299 --> 01:14:00.228
I just wanna finish
and get the hell out of here.

01:14:00.245 --> 01:14:02.424
This is gonna close them.
— Don’t drink that!

01:14:11.148 --> 01:14:12.724
— Hey!
— Hey!

01:14:12.818 --> 01:14:14.918
You guys I bet you could use some help.

01:14:18.069 --> 01:14:19.889
Yeah. Yeah, great, uh…

01:14:20.233 --> 01:14:23.871
If—if ya all could help with the
food tents, that’d be great.

01:14:23.903 --> 01:14:25.121
— Got it.
— Thanks.

01:15:27.052 --> 01:15:28.838
— You want a beer?
— Lots of beer.

01:15:28.878 --> 01:15:30.471
— Hey, Steve.
— Hey Jesse, how ya doing?

01:15:30.503 --> 01:15:32.424
Can I get a couple of pitchers?
— Sure

01:15:33.992 --> 01:15:35.610
Nice work, Steve.

01:15:37.134 --> 01:15:40.186
That town fair idea, that was…
that was smart.

01:15:41.952 --> 01:15:43.772
Well thank you, Dustin.

01:15:45.084 --> 01:15:46.956
Sure that was pretty hard for you to say.

01:15:50.082 --> 01:15:52.182
You like your job, Steve?

01:15:52.525 --> 01:15:54.806
You love what you do?
— Yeah.

01:15:55.712 --> 01:15:58.123
On days like this, yeah, I do.

01:15:58.866 --> 01:16:00.098
Thanks Jesse.

01:16:00.129 --> 01:16:04.712
Hey, get my friend a beer as well,
one of those fancy imported ones.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:05.486
Sure.

01:16:05.525 --> 01:16:08.022
Yeah, maybe like a granola bar,
if you have it.

01:16:08.570 --> 01:16:10.046
I see you there.

01:16:10.327 --> 01:16:12.012
You have what it takes, Steve?

01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:14.309
— Hmm?
— Thank you.

01:16:16.915 --> 01:16:18.420
You think you have what it takes?

01:16:18.568 --> 01:16:21.097
Oh, to beat you? Yeah. Absolutely.

01:16:21.347 --> 01:16:23.008
Well. You just might…

01:16:23.056 --> 01:16:25.045
— Hey man, I’ll drink to that.
— Okay.

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.467
Hey, there she is! You ready to go?

01:16:28.529 --> 01:16:29.823
— Yeah.
— Alright.

01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:32.120
Hey Steve, thanks again for
the beer, that was really sweet.

01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:33.245
I’m gonna take it to go.

01:16:33.284 --> 01:16:35.493
Hope you guys have
a great night, thanks Jesse!

01:16:35.993 --> 01:16:38.212
I’m really looking forward
to the fair tomorrow.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.765
Should be fun.
— Yeah.

01:16:41.538 --> 01:16:42.658
Yeah!

01:17:01.854 --> 01:17:03.392
Steeeve!

01:17:03.541 --> 01:17:04.661
Well old man!

01:17:10.872 --> 01:17:12.627
Hey, what d’you think ‘bout my new ride?

01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:14.039
I figured I’d treat myself.

01:17:14.077 --> 01:17:16.047
— That’s your car?
— Yeah, it’s my car.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.781
I went all the way to Barton to get it.

01:17:19.146 --> 01:17:21.246
Com’on, I’m buying. I got it.

01:17:43.574 --> 01:17:44.957
We lost.

01:17:46.121 --> 01:17:47.321
Let’s just go, huh?

01:17:57.084 --> 01:17:58.044
Stop.

01:18:00.894 --> 01:18:02.454
It’ll ruin out the cranking!

01:18:05.922 --> 01:18:07.466
Stop it, Steven!

01:18:11.053 --> 01:18:12.453
Goddammit!

01:18:38.286 --> 01:18:39.885
Oh, isn’t that good.

01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.120
Nice day!

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.218
That was so good.

01:18:59.037 --> 01:19:00.237
I’m stuffed.

01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:05.052
It’s great. Thank you.

01:19:05.194 --> 01:19:06.552
You’re more than welcome.

01:19:06.599 --> 01:19:08.753
I’d love the recipe for this.
This cake.

01:19:08.769 --> 01:19:11.555
Would you—would you let me take
that home, it would be great, Arlene.

01:19:11.648 --> 01:19:12.848
You cook, Sue?

01:19:13.087 --> 01:19:15.928
Hmm. My son. My son’s a cooker.

01:19:16.038 --> 01:19:19.379
He used to pull the chair up to the
counter when he was little and help me

01:19:19.435 --> 01:19:23.995
strip things up, now he is
the chef and I’m the sous-chef.

01:19:24.022 --> 01:19:28.043
Uhm… Where I put it, where I put it?
Here’s the picture.

01:19:31.746 --> 01:19:35.650
Like I—I get him down and—and
sometimes he talks to me about stuff.

01:19:35.681 --> 01:19:37.081
Look at that.

01:19:37.515 --> 01:19:40.256
Hey, hell. Oh, hey. Wow!

01:19:43.144 --> 01:19:47.204
You know, Frank’s Dad died
when Frank was only 8.

01:19:48.224 --> 01:19:52.253
And his mom always talked about
the clarity of purpose.

01:19:52.386 --> 01:19:56.079
He would understand exactly
what he’d have to do every day.

01:19:56.323 --> 01:20:00.813
What about you, Steve, where did
you say you were from? Iowa?

01:20:01.602 --> 01:20:03.233
— Eldridge.
— Oh yeah?

01:20:03.328 --> 01:20:05.037
You still have family up there?

01:20:06.272 --> 01:20:07.232
No.

01:20:08.201 --> 01:20:10.363
Wait a minute, did you say Eldridge?

01:20:10.663 --> 01:20:13.063
They had a plant up there?

01:20:14.047 --> 01:20:15.607
A Caterpillar plant.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:20.091
Yeah, that’s right.
I had a friend there…

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.600
from Boeing who lived up there.

01:20:26.069 --> 01:20:27.629
I remember that.

01:20:30.129 --> 01:20:31.329
Wasn’t pretty.

01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:36.576
Yeah when they closed that,
that, you know was it, really.

01:20:38.432 --> 01:20:40.232
The town was just…

01:20:41.500 --> 01:20:42.620
hollowed out.

01:20:45.802 --> 01:20:49.764
What, and no pretty lady to hand
out free money to save you?

01:20:50.738 --> 01:20:53.138
Yeah, what would you
have done then, Steven?

01:20:53.942 --> 01:20:55.742
I’d move so fuckin’ fast.

01:20:57.916 --> 01:21:00.679
I’d just take the money, and leave…

01:21:01.708 --> 01:21:02.908
Just leave.

01:21:06.844 --> 01:21:08.644
And where would we all go?

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:15.856
Excuse me.

01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:59.590
Miniature horses.

01:21:59.925 --> 01:22:03.926
Oh my God, we…
thought we were losing our minds.

01:22:05.696 --> 01:22:07.920
A lot of us breed them up here.

01:22:08.393 --> 01:22:11.217
Some people consider them an abomination.

01:22:13.081 --> 01:22:14.703
Big industry here.

01:22:15.242 --> 01:22:17.042
What do they get for ‘em?

01:22:18.907 --> 01:22:20.467
Not enough, Steve.

01:22:25.341 --> 01:22:27.141
You’re a good man, Steve.

01:22:29.718 --> 01:22:32.848
You have so many of the qualities
we need more of these days.

01:22:34.145 --> 01:22:35.431
I just wish…

01:22:37.885 --> 01:22:39.814
I just wish you weren’t doing this.

01:22:44.057 --> 01:22:45.857
You came here and offered us money…

01:22:46.458 --> 01:22:48.018
Figured that you were…

01:22:48.487 --> 01:22:49.887
helping us.

01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:56.411
All we had to do to get it was be willing
to scorch the earth, under our feet.

01:22:58.223 --> 01:23:00.323
We have nothing left to sell.

01:23:02.383 --> 01:23:04.599
And we can’t afford to buy anything.

01:23:07.096 --> 01:23:08.320
Don’t get me wrong.

01:23:09.572 --> 01:23:11.671
I’m not better than my neighbors.

01:23:12.414 --> 01:23:14.210
Hell, I need the money too.

01:23:15.114 --> 01:23:16.914
I guess I’m lucky…

01:23:19.977 --> 01:23:25.029
Lucky to be old enough to have
a shot at dying, with my dignity.

01:23:29.029 --> 01:23:31.429
I’m worried for us, Steve.

01:23:37.702 --> 01:23:40.291
Let me know when you’re
ready to head back.

01:23:52.402 --> 01:23:54.067
Excuse me, sir. Steve?

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.803
There’s a package here for you.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:34.810
Holy shit.

01:24:43.843 --> 01:24:44.963
Sue.

01:24:49.866 --> 01:24:51.621
We got him, we win.
We win, we win!

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:55.143
The guy whole sob story
is fucking bullshit.

01:24:55.206 --> 01:24:57.516
Well, research did a whole check. Look.

01:24:57.579 --> 01:24:59.422
This guy is fucking lying.

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:00.311
Okay.
— What did they say?

01:25:00.342 --> 01:25:02.644
— What is that picture of?
— A picture of his family’s farm.

01:25:02.678 --> 01:25:03.980
Okay. Where is the farm located?

01:25:04.011 --> 01:25:05.144
— What?
— Where is the farm?

01:25:05.176 --> 01:25:06.816
— Uh, Nebraska.
— Great. what’s that?

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:08.478
— A silo.
— Look again.

01:25:12.572 --> 01:25:14.952
— Holy shit!
— It’s a fucking lighthouse!

01:25:15.695 --> 01:25:17.062
— Holy shit!
— Yeah!

01:25:17.107 --> 01:25:19.534
Now geography was never
really my strong suit, but

01:25:19.559 --> 01:25:22.222
I’m pretty sure there are
no oceans in Nebraska.

01:25:22.297 --> 01:25:24.935
— He made the whole thing up.
— He made the whole thing up.

01:25:25.315 --> 01:25:27.797
And when the town finds out,
that he lied to them,

01:25:27.835 --> 01:25:30.692
that he was manipulating them
in order to get their vote,

01:25:30.741 --> 01:25:33.020
well they’re gonna have
fucking field day with this guy!

01:25:34.623 --> 01:25:35.583
We win.

01:25:43.955 --> 01:25:45.192
Gerry Richards.

01:25:47.961 --> 01:25:49.161
Yeah Steve.

01:25:53.269 --> 01:25:54.469
What?

01:25:58.240 --> 01:25:59.440
Jesus!

01:26:01.855 --> 01:26:03.655
I’ve already been to see Richards.

01:26:04.513 --> 01:26:06.913
Everyone in town’s gonna know by morning.

01:26:07.984 --> 01:26:10.384
I just—I wanted you to hear it from me.

01:26:11.971 --> 01:26:14.371
You deserve someone
who tells you the truth.

01:26:19.199 --> 01:26:20.999
What are you doing here, Steve?

01:26:21.962 --> 01:26:23.522
I’m not a bad guy.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:27.929
Good night.

01:26:33.966 --> 01:26:35.366
Alice…

01:26:40.395 --> 01:26:42.195
if I had asked you out…

01:26:42.453 --> 01:26:44.013
I would have said yes.

01:26:49.281 --> 01:26:50.523
Good night.

01:27:07.566 --> 01:27:08.966
Thank you.

01:27:17.216 --> 01:27:19.616
You know, what you did
is gonna hurt a lot of people.

01:27:23.635 --> 01:27:25.435
Hey, what were you thinking, man?

01:27:26.670 --> 01:27:29.488
How does somebody even do that?
You—you came in here,

01:27:29.744 --> 01:27:32.780
and based your entire case
against us on a lie?

01:27:32.804 --> 01:27:34.140
Alright, Steve.

01:27:34.797 --> 01:27:36.597
I already talked to Richards, so just…

01:27:37.396 --> 01:27:38.420
let me go.

01:27:38.494 --> 01:27:41.046
I mean, did you think we
wouldn’t find out? What…?

01:27:42.703 --> 01:27:44.648
You just guaranteed we win.

01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:53.790
You know you’re gonna lose?

01:27:53.967 --> 01:27:55.087
Huh?

01:27:55.599 --> 01:27:59.495
Yeah, it might not be Athena that does it,
but one of these days, you’re gonna lose.

01:28:00.911 --> 01:28:02.711
I just hope I’m there to see it.

01:28:02.773 --> 01:28:05.111
I guarantee it’s not gonna
be Athena that does it.

01:28:05.141 --> 01:28:07.541
I mean, do you even know
how bad this is for you?

01:28:08.564 --> 01:28:09.764
Athena’s done.

01:28:10.912 --> 01:28:12.724
Done. It’s over for you.

01:28:16.869 --> 01:28:18.595
What else was I supposed to do?

01:28:19.479 --> 01:28:21.039
I mean, it isn’t a fair fight, Steve.

01:28:21.946 --> 01:28:24.852
I’m out there doing what?
Handing out flyers and posters?

01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:28.576
No, this vote meant everything!
And I had to do it.

01:28:28.802 --> 01:28:31.982
No. You didn’t.
You didn’t. You fucked up.

01:28:33.058 --> 01:28:34.924
You tell me, Steve.
What would I do?

01:28:36.907 --> 01:28:38.707
In a world where nobody cares.

01:28:39.215 --> 01:28:41.845
Where a company like yours can
just go into Lafayette, Louisiana,

01:28:41.851 --> 01:28:43.283
do something like that?

01:28:44.082 --> 01:28:45.853
Or McKinley.
Or the next place,

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:49.892
’cause let’s be honest, it’s just gonna
happen again, and again, and again.

01:28:50.614 --> 01:28:53.869
So you tell me,
What am I supposed to do?

01:28:57.012 --> 01:29:00.012
I never told you this farm
was in Lafayette, Louisiana.

01:29:01.918 --> 01:29:03.118
What?

01:29:04.383 --> 01:29:05.920
What are you talking about?

01:29:06.175 --> 01:29:08.474
I never told you this happened
in Lafayette, Louisiana,

01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:10.310
how could you know that?

01:29:12.034 --> 01:29:13.847
Steve, those people needed my help.

01:29:14.114 --> 01:29:15.752
Okay? They called me!

01:29:15.814 --> 01:29:17.374
No, no.

01:29:17.823 --> 01:29:20.223
No, you said yourself
we’re too clever for that.

01:29:20.801 --> 01:29:23.399
These deals we have with
these people and the fine print,

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:24.564
they don’t call anybody.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.660
— Certainly not an environmentalist.
— Okay, Steve.

01:29:28.913 --> 01:29:30.023
Dustin…

01:29:30.641 --> 01:29:33.041
How did you know where this farm was?

01:29:37.130 --> 01:29:38.250
Dustin!

01:29:40.116 --> 01:29:41.715
How could I know, Steven?

01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:44.785
I should’ve just gotten in my car.

01:29:45.989 --> 01:29:47.109
What?

01:29:48.489 --> 01:29:50.289
We were never gonna let them vote, Steve.

01:29:59.572 --> 01:30:01.132
You’re with Global.

01:30:03.203 --> 01:30:05.810
Jesus Christ. You’re with Global.

01:30:05.838 --> 01:30:09.438
Did you really think they were gonna
leave something like this in your hands?

01:30:09.563 --> 01:30:11.963
After you let them bring it to a vote?

01:30:12.062 --> 01:30:15.997
Steve, companies like Global, they don’t
rely on anyone. That’s how they win.

01:30:16.145 --> 01:30:19.103
They win by controlling every outcome.

01:30:19.435 --> 01:30:21.835
And they do that by playing both sides.

01:30:25.444 --> 01:30:27.195
— But no, I—I was—
— What?

01:30:28.655 --> 01:30:30.215
What did you do?

01:30:31.278 --> 01:30:33.078
What is it you think you did?

01:30:35.553 --> 01:30:37.113
I did everything.

01:30:37.758 --> 01:30:40.238
Athena is me.

01:30:40.411 --> 01:30:41.690
This story is me.

01:30:41.713 --> 01:30:44.484
Getting you that package
to give to the politician…

01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:45.890
that’s me.

01:30:46.389 --> 01:30:48.800
You only did what I’ve let you do.

01:30:49.812 --> 01:30:51.372
But you did a good job.

01:30:52.067 --> 01:30:53.478
Now it’s over, we won.

01:30:57.932 --> 01:30:59.492
And this farm…

01:30:59.631 --> 01:31:02.699
Stay with me. Alright?
This farm. That doesn’t matter.

01:31:02.715 --> 01:31:04.814
They’ve already dealt with this.
This is done.

01:31:05.578 --> 01:31:07.378
They said this was a false claim.

01:31:09.603 --> 01:31:10.563
Did they?

01:31:12.038 --> 01:31:14.442
You’re gonna want to stop
asking questions now, Steve.

01:31:15.438 --> 01:31:17.238
You’re at the big kids table.

01:31:19.518 --> 01:31:22.281
But listen. It has been fun.

01:31:23.598 --> 01:31:27.252
I think you’re really a good choice
for this. You do a good job.

01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:31.100
Good luck in New York.

01:32:05.273 --> 01:32:06.233
Funny.

01:32:07.741 --> 01:32:08.701
Smart.

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.947
before this game gets started
to get the vote in.

01:32:52.502 --> 01:32:54.228
Go pioneers, yeah!

01:32:55.054 --> 01:32:57.934
Right, let me state how
all this thing is gonna work. Uhm…

01:32:58.013 --> 01:33:01.458
If your last name starts
with the letter ‘A’,

01:33:01.701 --> 01:33:02.901
Lemonade?

01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:12.714
— Is it good?
— Really good.

01:33:22.755 --> 01:33:24.602
Have a really good spot here.

01:33:24.805 --> 01:33:25.765
I know.

01:33:35.746 --> 01:33:36.706
Wow.

01:33:37.738 --> 01:33:38.698
I know.

01:33:51.162 --> 01:33:52.122
Uh, Mister?

01:33:54.642 --> 01:33:57.592
— You forgot your change.
— I’m just glad you keep it.

01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.680
The sign says it’s only twenty five cents.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:02.304
So…

01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:04.370
it’s only twenty five cents.

01:34:07.939 --> 01:34:11.499
Make sure you give it right back
here and support our pioneer!

01:34:23.473 --> 01:34:27.143
Uh oh, and one more thing.
Before we get to the vote,

01:34:27.274 --> 01:34:29.627
Steve Butler just wanted
to say a few words.

01:34:43.137 --> 01:34:44.948
I’ll be very brief.

01:34:46.655 --> 01:34:49.655
I know there’s been a lot
of talk about this…

01:34:50.301 --> 01:34:51.701
this picture.

01:34:52.885 --> 01:34:54.005
So…

01:34:54.843 --> 01:34:57.243
I brought it to show everybody, uhm…

01:34:59.902 --> 01:35:02.775
that’s the—the lighthouse on the ocean.

01:35:05.276 --> 01:35:07.578
I was looking at this picture…

01:35:08.336 --> 01:35:12.763
looking at it just
for a while last night…

01:35:13.162 --> 01:35:14.722
for a long while…

01:35:15.870 --> 01:35:19.211
and found myself
staring at this—this barn.

01:35:19.348 --> 01:35:23.595
The—the wood’s chipping away
and the—the paint’s flaking off there.

01:35:23.712 --> 01:35:27.194
Probably from all the salt
water in the air. But it…

01:35:27.823 --> 01:35:30.223
But it reminded me of
my grandfather’s barn.

01:35:31.111 --> 01:35:34.171
That barn was the…
the bane of my existence…

01:35:35.792 --> 01:35:38.086
It was immaculate, we used to…

01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:42.313
We painted it every other summer,
hum… just—just him and me.

01:35:43.319 --> 01:35:46.566
I—I asked him why?
Why do we have to do this?

01:35:47.072 --> 01:35:50.327
And uh, he’d just look at me and say,

01:35:50.844 --> 01:35:53.365
“This is our barn,
who else is gonna do it?”

01:35:55.647 --> 01:35:57.447
I used to think the guy was crazy…

01:36:00.081 --> 01:36:02.205
And stubborn, and proud.

01:36:06.068 --> 01:36:08.081
But see, I think…

01:36:11.397 --> 01:36:15.301
he was just trying to teach me
what it meant to take care of something.

01:36:23.346 --> 01:36:25.393
Okay. Well…

01:36:26.604 --> 01:36:28.570
You all know that Dustin lied…

01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:33.183
Trying to get you to vote
the way he wanted you to vote.

01:36:35.572 --> 01:36:40.132
And that’s exactly what he did,
because you are about to vote…

01:36:40.554 --> 01:36:42.622
exactly as he wants you to vote.

01:36:44.233 --> 01:36:47.816
Because Dustin isn’t an environmentalist.

01:36:49.808 --> 01:36:51.368
Dustin works for Global.

01:36:56.198 --> 01:36:59.422
They couldn’t afford an
environmental presence here. So…

01:37:00.198 --> 01:37:01.998
so they created their own.

01:37:04.349 --> 01:37:06.749
They’re trying to make
this decision for you…

01:37:08.124 --> 01:37:10.590
and they were betting that—
that you’d let them.

01:37:11.711 --> 01:37:13.208
This is a real farm.

01:37:14.291 --> 01:37:16.691
And they told these people
exactly what…

01:37:17.729 --> 01:37:20.015
what I’ve told a lot of you,
in fact I’ve…

01:37:21.118 --> 01:37:23.100
I’ve looked a lot of you
right in the eye…

01:37:24.426 --> 01:37:25.546
and told you that

01:37:25.944 --> 01:37:28.824
there’s a bunch of money under
your feet, and we can get it out

01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:30.903
risk free. Guaranteed.

01:37:33.209 --> 01:37:35.309
Clearly, that’s not true.

01:37:40.286 --> 01:37:41.686
I’m sorry.

01:37:51.214 --> 01:37:53.696
Look, is this gonna happen here?

01:37:53.974 --> 01:37:56.633
I—I honestly don’t believe that—
that it will.

01:37:59.406 --> 01:38:02.896
But they know the only reason we’re all
in this room is to ask the question:

01:38:02.965 --> 01:38:04.525
what if it did?

01:38:05.059 --> 01:38:07.459
And I—I don’t know what to tell you.

01:38:08.783 --> 01:38:10.883
I don’t know what to say anymore.

01:38:13.432 --> 01:38:15.674
But where—where we are now…

01:38:19.719 --> 01:38:21.539
where we’re headed…

01:38:26.881 --> 01:38:29.281
We might be betting more than we think.

01:38:31.179 --> 01:38:34.179
Everything that we have
is on the table now…

01:38:35.304 --> 01:38:37.517
And that’s just not ours to lose.

01:38:42.387 --> 01:38:44.244
But this is still our barn.

01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:54.010
Go Pioneers.

01:39:00.788 --> 01:39:01.908
Mm-hmm.

01:39:03.382 --> 01:39:04.502
Yeah.

01:39:07.303 --> 01:39:09.248
Okay. Yeah, I understand.

01:39:13.056 --> 01:39:14.756
— Was that them?
— Yes.

01:39:15.827 --> 01:39:17.387
You’re definitely fired.

01:39:19.049 --> 01:39:20.249
And?

01:39:21.475 --> 01:39:23.875
They want me in the city tomorrow.

01:39:25.703 --> 01:39:27.103
Well that’s…

01:39:27.382 --> 01:39:28.502
that’s great.

01:39:42.101 --> 01:39:43.901
You want a lift somewhere?

01:39:44.048 --> 01:39:45.490
What, are you kidding me?

01:39:47.209 --> 01:39:48.769
It’s open mic night!

01:39:55.017 --> 01:39:56.577
It’s just a job…

01:40:06.103 --> 01:40:08.944
Oh, for God Sakes,
just get some new boots.

01:40:09.165 --> 01:40:10.365
Not a chance.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:50.560
— Hey.
— Hey.

01:40:54.509 --> 01:40:56.358
— That’s it?
— Yeah, that’s it.

01:40:58.770 --> 01:41:02.160
— Sorry I can’t make the vote.
— Oh, I think we’ll be ok.

01:41:07.630 --> 01:41:09.030
That’s that.

01:41:12.785 --> 01:41:13.905
That’s that.

01:41:55.373 --> 01:41:57.089
Are you the owner of this place?
