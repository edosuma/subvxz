WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.208
I know you've missed me.

00:09.210 --> 00:12.211
Mm, baby, you know my
whole life has been

00:12.213 --> 00:14.179
absolutely terrible
since we broke up.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.515
(cell phone rings)
Mm.

00:19.119 --> 00:21.520
I got to take this.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.023
Okay, I'll be
right back?
Mmm.

00:26.126 --> 00:27.793
What'd you hear?

00:27.795 --> 00:28.994
The DA said what?!

00:28.996 --> 00:31.563
No. No, I want
them charged.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.632
I've given this guy
and his idiot friend

00:33.634 --> 00:34.500
way too many chances.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.035
They're going to jail this time.

00:36.037 --> 00:37.636
Come-come on.

00:37.638 --> 00:38.737
Weed, a gun,

00:38.739 --> 00:41.006
delinquent child support
and a parole violation?

00:41.008 --> 00:42.474
It's a crew of idiots.

00:42.476 --> 00:44.376
Yeah.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.711
(sighs)

00:45.713 --> 00:47.413
Mmm, are you ready for me?

00:47.415 --> 00:50.215
(moans)

00:50.217 --> 00:52.751
I'm about to rock your...

00:52.753 --> 00:53.752
What?

00:53.754 --> 00:55.087
What is it, baby?

00:55.089 --> 00:57.156
Um, you know I want
this to work, right?

00:59.426 --> 01:00.559
But what?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.928
And you... you know
I love you, right?

01:02.930 --> 01:04.096
(sighs)
What is it, Jason?

01:04.098 --> 01:05.431
I just don't...

01:05.433 --> 01:07.566
I don't think
it's gonna work.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.736
I mean, as-as long
as you're a cop.

01:12.772 --> 01:13.906
Sorry.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.207
You are actually
breaking up with me?

01:15.209 --> 01:17.209
Before we even
got back together?!

01:17.211 --> 01:21.080
You no-good, jobless,
bald-headed, brainwashed bitch!

01:57.150 --> 01:59.952
Damn.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.720
(music playing on radio)

02:01.722 --> 02:02.554
Bernadette.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.223
What?

02:04.225 --> 02:07.226
Turn the radio off.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.495
(music stops)

02:09.497 --> 02:11.063
I don't care
how long it takes.

02:11.065 --> 02:14.066
We're gonna hide until she gets
the (bleep) out of here.

02:14.068 --> 02:16.301
BERNADETTE:
You think they're in there?
JESUS: Oh, I... Oh, yeah.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.904
They're definitely in there.
Lloyd!

02:18.906 --> 02:22.407
Jesus! I wish he'd go away
for another 2,000 years.

02:22.409 --> 02:24.243
Me and you gotta stick together.
We can't let this bitch

02:24.245 --> 02:26.612
come between us.
That's what I'm talking about.
Stick together.

02:26.614 --> 02:28.614
We got to show a united front.
A united front!

02:28.616 --> 02:31.250
Where you know
Lloyd's janky ass from?
Oh, he's my husband.

02:31.252 --> 02:34.486
Oh, I'm... I apologize. Did
I say "janky"? I didn't...
Oh, that's okay.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.022
That's okay. Ex-husband. We're
trying to work it out, you know?
Oh. Oh, okay.

02:37.024 --> 02:40.025
Oh, y'all gettin' it
back together, huh?
(chuckles) Yeah.

02:40.027 --> 02:42.628
Oh, I love love. You
know, I'm all for love.
(laughs)

02:42.630 --> 02:45.497
I'm, like, the ambassador
of love. Lloyd,
Oh, okay.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.700
come on out here
and get this love, boy!

02:48.702 --> 02:51.937
(chuckling):
Hey. Guys, hey, there you go.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.438
Hey, guys, look,

02:53.440 --> 02:56.041
this is Lloyd's lovely
lawfully wedded wife, man.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.310
How about that? Did you know
Lloyd was married, Vic?

02:58.312 --> 03:00.312
We know who
she is.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.780
Hey, Vic, you smell great, man.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.649
Is that...
is that English Leather?

03:03.651 --> 03:05.851
You like starting trouble,
don't you, nigga?
Huh?

03:05.853 --> 03:07.786
Get out of here!

03:07.788 --> 03:11.123
LLOYD: A divorce?
Well, we haven't been living
as husband and wife

03:11.125 --> 03:12.958
in over a decade.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.393
We might as well
make it official.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.962
I can't believe it.
Thank you, Bernadette!

03:16.964 --> 03:19.865
Aw, you're so sweet.
(laughs)
Oh, okay. Okay.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.301
You don't have to be
that happy about it.
Yeah.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.335
Congratulations.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.604
Let's celebrate. Hit the Darby!

03:32.912 --> 03:34.413
I'm so proud of you, Fish.

03:34.415 --> 03:38.417
After five long years,
seconds away from freedom.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.419
Mm.
Yeah, it's a big day right here.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.321
All right, y'all,

03:42.323 --> 03:45.490
it's the last one, homies.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.926
Five years to the day.
I've been good, though.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.562
I've been damn good.
Yeah, relatively.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.331
(chuckles)
Thank you, Father.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.166
"Have you been arrested
in the last month?"

03:54.168 --> 03:56.768
Nope. Miss me
with that. Swerve.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.737
"Have you moved since
your last probation meeting?"

03:58.739 --> 04:01.873
Nope. Same crib.
Holla at your boy.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.008
All right. "Please wait."

04:03.010 --> 04:05.677
I can wait.
Ain't in no rush.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.813
"Please take your ticket."
All right, where my ticket?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.518
BOONIE:
Yo, what's wrong, man?

04:13.520 --> 04:16.221
Let me see it.
"Please see attendant."

04:16.223 --> 04:17.689
Yeah, what does
that mean?

04:17.691 --> 04:20.225
They gonna piss me.
BOONIE:
Oh, shit.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.227
They did the same thing
to my cousin Manny.

04:22.229 --> 04:24.696
Hit him
with a last-day piss test.

04:24.698 --> 04:25.964
What happened?

04:25.966 --> 04:28.367
He had herb in his system.
He violated his parole.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.203
He had to serve his original
sentence. Four years.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.939
Damn, he had to do four years
for smoking a (bleep) joint?

04:33.941 --> 04:36.875
Calm down, calm down. This
ain't even a case, you know?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.477
Just relax,
just relax.
So you gonna holla

04:38.479 --> 04:39.911
at Pops?
He can handle this for me?
No,

04:39.913 --> 04:42.080
see, 'cause-'cause
Pops, see, you know,

04:42.082 --> 04:43.649
he kind of do
his own thing...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.450
Nigga, all my goddamn food
you eat, and you can't

04:45.452 --> 04:46.718
holla at your pops
to handle this?

04:46.720 --> 04:47.886
Fish, you
know damn well

04:47.888 --> 04:48.920
how Pops get
down, man.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.789
His powers is
infinite, but mine?

04:50.791 --> 04:53.458
Mine are limited, dawg. I-I
can only do what I can do.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.327
Let me see it, man. It say,
"Please see attendant

04:55.329 --> 04:56.895
in the next 48 hours."

04:56.897 --> 04:58.563
Look, I went through this
with Manny, man.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.233
I know how to beat the test.
I know the science

05:01.235 --> 05:04.503
behind this. I'm-a show you
how to beat the game, baby.

05:04.505 --> 05:08.407
Nigga, you can't even spell
"science." Move, man.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.275
So, he does that every night?

05:10.277 --> 05:11.943
Every night.

05:11.945 --> 05:14.346
Well, come on.
Let's let him sleep.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.482
Let him sleep.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.818
Hey, come on, now.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.587
We can't do this.
We can.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.190
No, we can't. It's adultery.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.526
God knows Lloyd and I
are through.

05:27.528 --> 05:31.596
Look, we're talking
paperwork, lawyers.

05:31.598 --> 05:34.032
Me and Lloyd are still friends.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.968
What you think he's gonna
think about all this?

05:36.970 --> 05:38.637
He would be happy for us.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.305
Lloyd doesn't want
me anymore.

05:40.307 --> 05:45.277
Come on now, baby. You don't
have to feel guilty at all.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.778
Mmm.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.214
Not at all.
(chuckles)

05:49.216 --> 05:50.515
(Vic chuckles)

05:50.517 --> 05:52.184
(snoring)
VIC:
Lord have mercy.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.152
(Bernadette chuckles)

05:54.154 --> 05:57.456
(birds chirping)

05:59.325 --> 06:01.326
(sniffs)

06:01.328 --> 06:04.029
(grunts)

06:06.833 --> 06:08.033
(groans)

06:08.035 --> 06:11.903
Did it again.

06:11.905 --> 06:15.073
Oh, man. No, no.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.183
JASON:
Man, all I know is, all
I kept hearing her talk about

06:25.185 --> 06:26.518
was locking
people up.

06:26.520 --> 06:29.321
And the sad part is,
they sound just like us.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.690
Man, that's just scary to
me, man. I don't know, bro.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.025
Boonie, I know you better be
right about this shit, man.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.994
All this damn water
I'm drinkin'...

06:35.996 --> 06:38.730
You guys, none of this
shit actually works.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.167
You cannot pass a piss test
in 48 hours.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.235
I could if I had--

06:43.237 --> 06:44.836
I don't know-- Jesus

06:44.838 --> 06:47.439
on my side. Just
sayin', bro.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.442
Brah, me and Pops both
on your side, brother.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.844
I just know he wants you
to face his music, man.

06:52.846 --> 06:55.580
God knows I don't deserve
to go to jail, man.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.416
Especially for
smoking no damn weed.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.950
All the weed
his son smoked.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.952
Put my goddamn
potato salad down.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.188
Nigga, you didn't put in
on that.

07:03.190 --> 07:05.357
BOONIE:
Hey, Fish, don't get in
no serious relationship

07:05.359 --> 07:06.691
in jail, man.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.059
They might get out before you.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.361
You be heartbroke.

07:09.363 --> 07:12.364
Boy, oh, what
a long night.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.199
Oh. Have you seen Bernadette?

07:14.201 --> 07:15.867
I think she's
in the bathroom.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.036
Oh, man. Let me tell you
something, boy.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.940
That Bernadette,
that woman know how to party.

07:21.942 --> 07:26.144
(whoops)
Sure do. I don't remember
a thing about last night.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.613
I do. Sex.
Look at here.

07:28.615 --> 07:33.385
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!

07:33.387 --> 07:34.820
(laughs)

07:34.822 --> 07:37.289
Sex? I ain't
have sex last night.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.257
Not you. Me!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.625
You?
Yeah.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.428
And who
you have sex with?
(laughing)

07:43.430 --> 07:45.564
Bernadette.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.965
Bernadette. (laughing): Oh.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.468
There must be some mistake.
I mean, you was

07:49.470 --> 07:51.470
over here,
she was over there, you know?

07:51.472 --> 07:53.472
No way.
Now I was
passed out.

07:53.474 --> 07:57.742
She wakes me up, on top of me,
kissing me all over my face.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.811
Then she started
unbuttoning her blouse.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.780
And pull out them
tig old bitties.

08:01.782 --> 08:04.149
<i>Ooh!</i> I did the old

08:04.151 --> 08:06.918
Lil Wayne move. Put your
foot up on the bathtub.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.987
You'll be shaking
like this.

08:10.690 --> 08:13.692
I did it three or four times
like that. Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh! Eh!

08:13.694 --> 08:15.460
I don't want to hear
no more of this shit, man.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.461
I even used some
of your dick pills.

08:16.463 --> 08:17.629
That's enough!

08:17.631 --> 08:19.531
I'll pay you back.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.633
Vic, where are you going?

08:21.635 --> 08:25.337
Bernadette! Bitch!

08:25.339 --> 08:28.306
Vic, have you lost your mind?!

08:28.308 --> 08:30.275
Who the hell
you calling a bitch?!

08:30.277 --> 08:31.610
(quietly):
Yeah.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.645
LLOYD:
Yeah, Vic.

08:33.647 --> 08:36.014
I was calling Lloyd a bitch.
I got to pee real bad.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.053
Don't forget.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.155
(Vic groaning)
Lawyer meeting at 2:00.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.657
I'll be there.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.192
(Vic groans loudly)

08:47.194 --> 08:49.160
Vic, you okay in there?

08:49.162 --> 08:50.795
Vic?!
(loud groaning)

08:50.797 --> 08:54.566
I'm gonna make you a bowl
of Pepto-Bismol and Darby.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.874
Goddamn it!

09:02.876 --> 09:05.443
(rolling thunder)

09:12.418 --> 09:14.219
What's happening, Vic?

09:14.221 --> 09:16.187
Hey, I didn't mean
to startle you, dawg.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.856
I was just looking
for the boy Fish, man.

09:17.858 --> 09:21.059
You seen him?
Hell no,
I ain't seen Fish, man.

09:21.061 --> 09:24.930
He's probably taking a bath with
some Oil of Olay or some shit.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.599
(laughs)
(bleep) Fish, man.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.569
Wait a minute.
Let me look at you.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.738
Damn, Vic, you look
stressed as (bleep), man.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.373
You been getting
enough sleep, brah?

09:35.375 --> 09:37.409
Nigga, I've been getting
plenty of sleep.

09:37.411 --> 09:39.444
It's not me, okay? It's...

09:39.446 --> 09:41.880
Friend of mine's
going through something.

09:41.882 --> 09:44.950
Yeah, man, friends can put
a lot on you, man. That's...

09:44.952 --> 09:47.085
Hey, man, get your hands
off me, man!

09:47.087 --> 09:51.590
Friend made a big mistake.
Keeps on making the same mistake

09:51.592 --> 09:52.958
over and over.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.628
Yeah. You know, Vic, it
ain't none of my business--

09:56.630 --> 09:59.764
not at all, none of my
business-- but if I was you,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.866
I'd tell that friend
to take responsibility

10:01.868 --> 10:03.468
and remove himself
from that situation

10:03.470 --> 10:05.036
that's causing him
that temptation.

10:05.038 --> 10:08.640
He tried to take responsibility,
but no matter what he does,

10:08.642 --> 10:11.610
the problem just keeps
getting worse and worse.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.778
I know you'll do the
right thing, pimp.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.481
Hey, I'm not talking
about me, okay?

10:16.483 --> 10:20.619
I'm talking about my friend,
not me.

10:20.621 --> 10:23.154
And in the future,
keep your hands off me.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.524
I be wearing
tailor-made suits... homie.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.863
And your tailor is definitely
not your friend, brah.

10:36.435 --> 10:37.902
Vic,

10:37.904 --> 10:39.337
what's wrong?

10:39.339 --> 10:41.573
Why you been acting so strange?

10:41.575 --> 10:43.975
And why are we meeting
in a parking lot?

10:43.977 --> 10:47.312
Maybe 'cause you had sex with
me and Lloyd in the same night.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.981
I never knew
you'd be mad about that.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.317
You never knew I would
be mad about that?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.486
No.
Who wouldn't be
mad about that?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.688
Vic, he's my husband.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.491
I can't make love
to you and not him.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.092
That's disrespectful.

11:01.094 --> 11:03.161
Disrespectful?
Yeah.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.130
What about adultery?

11:05.132 --> 11:06.665
What about
going to hell?

11:06.667 --> 11:09.167
Vic, nobody really
believes in hell.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.535
I believe in hell.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.303
And that's where
we're both gonna go

11:12.305 --> 11:13.972
if we don't straighten
this out fast.

11:13.974 --> 11:17.008
Look, as soon as you
get a divorce from Lloyd,

11:17.010 --> 11:19.878
I want you to marry me.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.513
Oh, my God! Vic!

11:21.515 --> 11:23.181
You want me to marry you, Vic?

11:23.183 --> 11:25.183
Not exactly right now.
I mean, you know, I'm still

11:25.185 --> 11:27.519
kind of grossed out over what
happened with you and Lloyd.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.521
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Yeah?

11:29.523 --> 11:32.524
Oh, you... Yes.
Yeah, yeah.

ring, huh?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.695

Are you kidding me?
And I also

11:36.697 --> 11:39.297

freaky in cars.

Huh? Jason, are you in there?!
Jay's not here

you got trouble on your mind.
Share with your boy.

12:02.322 --> 12:06.391
Come on.
That asshole told me he couldn't
be with me because I'm a cop.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.059
He lives in a truck
with a vagrant,

12:08.061 --> 12:10.995
and he's too good for me?!
What kind of shit is that?

12:10.997 --> 12:13.732
I think what Jason trying to say
is, he afraid of you, girl.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.701

accept his homeboy.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.070

Uh-uh.

you gonna take us away.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.441
Hey, but, look, though, in all
the time you known Jay, have you

12:23.443 --> 12:25.210
ever once came and hung out
with his homies

12:25.212 --> 12:26.411
and then did the type
of stuff he liked?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.746
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!
Have you ever did

12:27.748 --> 12:29.180
the type of stuff
he like to do?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.582
One time?
'Cause I know he asked.

12:30.584 --> 12:33.518
That's because all you
guys do is get high,

12:33.520 --> 12:35.253
and I'm a cop, genius.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.588

13:02.816 --> 13:05.150

13:06.586 --> 13:08.219

to ruin my life?

13:16.830 --> 13:18.463

This is a simple test of faith,
and you're failing it right now.
