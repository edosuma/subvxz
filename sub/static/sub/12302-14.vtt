WEBVTT

00:54.315 --> 00:55.623
Bellman!

00:55.844 --> 00:57.937
- Leave them by the bed.
- Yes, sir.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.742
Thanks for the tip.

01:20.986 --> 01:22.263
Okay, sir.

01:26.614 --> 01:27.912
What the heck...?

01:30.043 --> 01:31.495
I swear, I didn't...

01:34.443 --> 01:36.498
Single shot to the head.

01:36.543 --> 01:38.240
No mystery there.

01:42.371 --> 01:44.134
Looks like a claim ticket.

01:44.565 --> 01:45.852
That never got claimed.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.770
Four of five items.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.300
Biscayne Suite.

01:49.730 --> 01:51.060
Valet cart's gone, too.

01:51.128 --> 01:53.524
Whatever was delivered
was taken back out.

01:53.770 --> 01:55.896
This hotel caters to cruise passengers.

01:55.962 --> 01:57.759
Guests usually stay here one night.

01:57.841 --> 01:59.250
Fly in on Saturday,

02:00.623 --> 02:02.479
board the ship on Sunday, right ?

02:02.538 --> 02:05.784
This time of year, half the hotels
on Collins are booked through cruise lines.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.086
Population of Miami
goes up 30,000 a night.

02:08.169 --> 02:11.794
Just like our list of suspects.

03:05.338 --> 03:06.571
Hotel security said the shower

03:06.595 --> 03:08.591
was running full blast
when they entered.

03:08.650 --> 03:10.740
Great way to cover your
tracks, don't you think ?

03:10.810 --> 03:12.665
I found a bar of soap
in the shower.

03:13.663 --> 03:15.048
There are some smudges.

03:15.083 --> 03:18.505
- Maybe we can get can get a print off of it.
- Ah, the missing fifth bag.

03:19.545 --> 03:22.031
Bellman in the lobby said our vic
didn't have room on his cart.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.824
Who was the room rented to, Frank ?

03:24.130 --> 03:25.433
That would be a...

03:25.995 --> 03:27.286
Fulana Perez.

03:29.224 --> 03:30.133
What's so funny ?

03:30.140 --> 03:33.181
Fulana Perez is Cuban
for Jane Doe.

03:33.416 --> 03:34.825
Fulana means "so and so."

03:36.198 --> 03:37.143
Yeah, well, whatever.

03:37.149 --> 03:39.398
She sent a money wire
from Trenton to hold the room.

03:39.410 --> 03:40.607
Let's see what else she sent.

03:40.666 --> 03:41.969
Mr. Wolfe, please.

03:48.277 --> 03:49.580
It's just paper.

03:49.780 --> 03:51.412
Send the paper to Q.D.

03:52.319 --> 03:53.623
And tell me...

03:54.010 --> 03:55.314
what is that ?

04:01.717 --> 04:02.915
It's a lock of hair.

04:02.950 --> 04:04.171
It's brown.

04:04.488 --> 04:05.603
Maybe from a struggle.

04:05.615 --> 04:08.821
But it's been scissored,
which is typical of kidnappings.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.660
Gentlemen, this is a message.

04:12.695 --> 04:13.975
The question is:

04:14.221 --> 04:16.428
Who was it meant for?

04:25.270 --> 04:26.574
Uh, excuse me.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.018
I saw your badge.
Are you a cop ?

04:28.053 --> 04:29.333
CSI. Calleigh Duquesne.

04:29.369 --> 04:30.625
Can you help me, please ?

04:31.611 --> 04:32.844
My wife is missing.

04:32.915 --> 04:34.194
That's Erica.

04:34.566 --> 04:36.304
We flew in from
Indianapolis last night.

04:36.456 --> 04:37.771
We leave on a cruise today.

04:37.901 --> 04:39.591
It's our first vacation
in three years.

04:40.038 --> 04:41.364
When did you last see her ?

04:41.791 --> 04:44.707
About 9:00 last night.
The sushi restaurant upstairs.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.100
How'd the two of you get separated?

04:47.438 --> 04:48.683
I should never drink sake.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.466
We-we split a couple of bottles,
and that's the last I remember.

04:51.567 --> 04:53.670
- Is this your information ?
- Yeah.

04:53.951 --> 04:56.139
- I'll do everything I can.
- Thak you.

04:56.886 --> 04:58.212
Hi. It's a busy place.

04:58.236 --> 04:59.633
You here for the bellman shooting ?

04:59.665 --> 05:03.141
Yeah, but hotel security found
a D.B. in the service elevator.

05:03.176 --> 05:04.268
Is  this her ?

05:05.149 --> 05:06.675
Not so many clothes, but yeah.

05:07.051 --> 05:08.401
- That the husband ?
- Yeah.

05:09.407 --> 05:10.827
Two bodies, one hotel.

05:10.863 --> 05:12.213
- Any connection ?
- Yeah.

05:12.958 --> 05:14.544
Saturday during cruise season.

05:14.820 --> 05:16.135
Say no more.

05:16.933 --> 05:18.601
Good thing I brought my big van.

05:18.683 --> 05:19.986
Heard you found Mrs. Hanford.

05:20.273 --> 05:23.563
Maids found her body this
morning. First run of the day.

05:23.598 --> 05:25.520
Die  young, leave
a beautiful corpse.

05:26.905 --> 05:28.174
Strange.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.653
Tongue looks swollen.

05:30.405 --> 05:31.778
Any guess as to cause of death ?

05:32.377 --> 05:33.458
Not yet.

05:33.505 --> 05:35.501
Biologicals on her inner thighs.

05:36.311 --> 05:37.649
On her underwear, too.

05:38.483 --> 05:40.960
Caring husband just got a little creepy.

05:41.852 --> 05:44.893
I'm gonna have Tripp bring him in
and see if we can get a DNA reference.

05:46.052 --> 05:47.567
Got any luck on the fingerprints ?

05:50.369 --> 05:51.884
Fingerprints, no.

05:52.154 --> 05:54.209
But, uh, palm prints, yes.

06:04.971 --> 06:06.216
See that ?

06:06.345 --> 06:07.613
It's a watermark.

06:07.695 --> 06:08.987
Of a dead president.

06:09.151 --> 06:11.391
Yeah, Ulysses S. Grant
from the $50 bill.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.093
Are you telling me
this is currency paper ?

06:13.128 --> 06:15.512
Technically, it isn't
even paper-- it's rag.

06:17.347 --> 06:19.707
Cotton-to-linen ratio is 70-30.

06:21.938 --> 06:23.570
Take a look at this security stripe.

06:27.269 --> 06:30.040
This one's placed within
the Bureau of Engraving tolerances.

06:30.584 --> 06:31.852
And...

06:32.204 --> 06:33.484
It glows yellow ?

06:33.754 --> 06:35.069
Did it come from the mint ?

06:35.257 --> 06:36.293
Mint makes coins.

06:36.329 --> 06:39.262
All paper currency comes
from a company in Dalton, Mass.

06:39.914 --> 06:42.591
That's where the red and blue fibers
are cooked into the paper.

06:42.721 --> 06:45.996
It's then sliced into sheets like
this one, loaded onto grocery trucks,

06:46.055 --> 06:48.169
moving trucks, all kinds of trucks.

06:49.687 --> 06:51.894
Even the drivers don't know
what they're hauling.

06:52.986 --> 06:55.111
So if it's real,
when did these go missing ?

06:55.558 --> 06:57.941
I don't know, but I saw
a Secret Service guy

06:57.988 --> 06:59.562
cooling his heels in Reception.

07:00.093 --> 07:01.350
Bet he knows.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.990
Lieutenant Caine.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.390
Agent Elliott.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.780
I believe this is record time for you.
Thank you.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.764
Leak in the money supply line'll do that.

07:11.339 --> 07:16.129
We knew the Dalton truck was hijacked on its
way to Texas earlier this week. Just didn't
know where the paper ended up. Until now.

07:16.293 --> 07:18.172
32 bills per sheet, 3,000 sheets.

07:18.324 --> 07:19.892
That's $10 million.

07:19.904 --> 07:21.166
Roughly, yeah.

07:22.005 --> 07:24.870
- We got a suspect ?
- We are still working on it.

07:25.851 --> 07:28.070
- I have jurisdiction here.
- Don't we all ?

07:29.393 --> 07:30.696
Agent.

07:31.765 --> 07:35.416
So Calleigh said you were done collecting
the sexual assault kit on elevator girl.

07:35.698 --> 07:36.990
Thought I was.

07:39.162 --> 07:40.512
Then I found this.

07:40.912 --> 07:41.804
Tissue ?

07:41.882 --> 07:45.017
Between bicuspid number five
and cuspid number six.

07:45.475 --> 07:46.828
So there was a fight.

07:46.933 --> 07:49.517
Or just bad oral hygiene.

07:49.693 --> 07:53.121
- Maybe just bad oral.
- Okay. No comment on that.

07:53.485 --> 07:55.056
I assume that's not what killed her.

07:55.138 --> 07:58.402
No, cause of death
was laryngeal edema

07:58.872 --> 08:01.948
leading to cardiovascular collapse.
Throat closed up.

08:08.743 --> 08:12.018
Her body reacted to
an outside substance.

08:12.136 --> 08:13.427
So it was an allergy ?

08:13.705 --> 08:15.596
Sent her into anaphylactic shock.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.308
Got tissue sections going to Histopath

08:18.601 --> 08:20.715
and we'll run a full
tox screen, of course.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.300
Find what she was allergic to.

08:22.394 --> 08:24.021
Could her death have been accidental ?

08:24.825 --> 08:26.433
Could've, yeah.

08:27.279 --> 08:29.299
But to leave a woman
the way we found her ?

08:30.038 --> 08:32.010
You've got to be guilty
of something, honey.

09:17.603 --> 09:19.118
It's good as gold.

09:21.548 --> 09:23.098
AFIS is still searching.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.706
Let's check with the State Department
and the Customs databases, all right ?

09:27.047 --> 09:28.808
Cause half the tourists
in Miami are foreign ?

09:28.832 --> 09:30.922
And they all have to check
with Immigration.

09:41.563 --> 09:44.006
I got a hit from the Feds,
but not a tourist.

09:44.146 --> 09:47.645
A Cuban exile, a dry-footer
from five years ago.

09:47.798 --> 09:51.133
Hit the shore at Haulover Beach.
Processed through Krome Detention Center.

09:51.156 --> 09:52.589
Right here in Miami.

09:52.871 --> 09:54.327
Think he knocked off
the currency truck ?

09:54.350 --> 09:56.475
If he didn't, he knows who did.

09:58.021 --> 09:59.935
Yeah, I was at the hotel,
meeting a friend.

10:00.323 --> 10:01.526
Helped a guy with his luggage.

10:01.544 --> 10:03.107
See, the problem, Juan,

10:03.178 --> 10:06.912
is that your luggage is not the
only place that we found your prints.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.025
This currency truck was hit
on its way to Fort Worth.

10:10.917 --> 10:12.561
Driver robbed at gunpoint.

10:13.078 --> 10:14.287
Does that sound familiar ?

10:22.839 --> 10:26.009
You transferred the paper
from the truck into five suitcases.

10:29.797 --> 10:33.555
We found your fingerprint on the truck
and on the suitcase left at the hotel.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.285
And it makes me curious

10:35.367 --> 10:38.091
as to why you allowed the driver to live,

10:38.150 --> 10:39.641
but you killed the bellman

10:40.732 --> 10:42.083
at the hotel ?

10:42.270 --> 10:43.797
No,  no, no. No way.

10:44.032 --> 10:45.793
Okay, I dropped the bags off at the curb

10:46.213 --> 10:47.305
and left.

10:47.343 --> 10:48.655
So they were your bags ?

10:48.784 --> 10:50.416
Yeah, I was hired
to do the truck job,

10:50.886 --> 10:52.201
and then hand the bags off.

10:58.087 --> 10:59.449
To a stranger ? Come on.

10:59.578 --> 11:01.316
Guy who hired me doesn't
want to know me,

11:01.715 --> 11:03.206
It's okay, I don't want to know him.

11:12.361 --> 11:15.402
So you come all the way
from Cuba to start a new life

11:16.376 --> 11:18.548
and you end up doing this, Juan ?

11:22.415 --> 11:23.789
I got out.

11:23.871 --> 11:25.222
My family didn't.

11:25.539 --> 11:27.547
Guy wants to give me cash
to send to them...

11:28.310 --> 11:30.083
What, huh ?
You wouldn't do the same ?

11:30.153 --> 11:33.112
You do realize the money's
counterfeit, though, right ?

11:35.965 --> 11:37.550
If it keeps my family alive...

11:38.923 --> 11:40.215
I don't care.

11:41.859 --> 11:44.149
At least we know how
the suitcases got to the hotel.

11:44.196 --> 11:46.133
Yes, we do. Let's find out

11:46.638 --> 11:47.930
how they left.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.387
Right, elevator woman.

12:01.692 --> 12:04.346
Semen on her body
was from a single donor.

12:04.581 --> 12:05.896
- The husband ?
- No.

12:09.786 --> 12:11.101
What about the tissue
in her teeth ?

12:11.113 --> 12:12.404
Human. Same donor.

12:12.839 --> 12:14.107
Any physical findings ?

12:14.212 --> 12:15.774
There was no vaginal tearing.

12:15.878 --> 12:17.687
So sex could've been consensual.

12:22.571 --> 12:25.334
It also could've been motive
if the husband found out about it.

12:26.097 --> 12:27.553
- Thanks, Valera.
- Sure.

12:29.268 --> 12:31.182
Tell me again where
you misplaced your wife ?

12:34.404 --> 12:35.766
At dinner, we...

12:36.706 --> 12:39.078
we started talking to this
couple at the next table.

12:40.439 --> 12:42.505
Nice people. Super friendly.

12:42.881 --> 12:44.924
- How friendly ?
- They told us about this party.

12:46.094 --> 12:48.478
I mean, normally, we would
never, you know ? But we...

12:49.370 --> 12:51.801
we figured one night... it's Miami.

12:52.165 --> 12:53.985
- What kind of party ?
- For couples.

12:54.819 --> 12:56.685
Guess they call it a Friction party.

12:57.214 --> 12:57.954
"Friction"?

13:08.560 --> 13:10.744
They told us to find them
somewhere at the party.

13:11.471 --> 13:12.810
Glad you made it.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.616
- I bet her you wouldn't show.
- This looks fun.

13:17.883 --> 13:20.184
Did she, um, did she
have sex with this guy ?

13:20.446 --> 13:21.820
It wasn't that kind of party.

13:22.278 --> 13:24.755
They said the rules were no sex, just...

13:25.988 --> 13:28.231
a lot of touching, rubbing.

13:28.701 --> 13:31.155
Couples get worked up enough
to go back to their own room.

13:31.613 --> 13:34.231
- Any stimulants ?
- There was a raw bar.

13:35.593 --> 13:37.225
Erica did some oyster shooters.

13:38.176 --> 13:39.961
Somebody told us
they were an aphrodisiac.

13:45.448 --> 13:47.045
I wanted her to have a good time.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.963
I started talking to
this woman from Arizona.

13:55.831 --> 13:57.440
Then she just disappeared.

13:58.344 --> 13:59.659
I looked all over.

13:59.753 --> 14:02.782
- Exactly where was the party ?
- The penthouse at the Agramonte.

14:40.586 --> 14:42.153
What did you get from the penthouse ?

14:42.442 --> 14:44.027
Almost done with the raw bar.

14:44.743 --> 14:46.899
You'll never guess what I just
found in this oyster shooter.

14:46.900 --> 14:47.851
Aspirin.

14:48.089 --> 14:51.424
- You cheated.
- Tox screen came back-- I peeked.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.930
Aceta-sala-something.

14:54.931 --> 14:57.975
Acetylsalicylic acid. It's the
active ingredient in aspirin.

14:58.010 --> 14:59.658
I guess she had
a hell of an allergy to it.

14:59.940 --> 15:01.162
Which glass was hers ?

15:01.302 --> 15:03.451
I don't know.
First one came back positive.

15:03.909 --> 15:05.389
I'm testing the rest of them now.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.678
They're all turning pink.

15:10.274 --> 15:12.109
Someone's dosed every glass.

15:13.264 --> 15:16.231
Still comes back to the one person
who knew about her allergy to aspirin.

15:16.981 --> 15:19.581
I did not spike any drinks with aspirin.

15:19.954 --> 15:22.307
What if I told you we had
your prints on the glasses?

15:22.367 --> 15:24.234
I'd say you have faulty equipment.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.888
We talked to some people
about your little naked party.

15:26.923 --> 15:28.293
They said you and your wife argued.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.065
That's true.

15:29.852 --> 15:31.266
I tried to get her to leave.

15:35.321 --> 15:38.350
Erica, I get one week of
vacation. Don't be like this.

15:38.374 --> 15:39.290
It's my vacation, too.

15:42.327 --> 15:44.057
I thought it was your idea
to go in the first place.

15:44.092 --> 15:45.168
I convinced her, yeah.

15:46.331 --> 15:49.331
But she ended up taking to it a
lot more than a PTA mom should.

15:58.846 --> 16:01.338
Look, you can talk to me
till you're blue in the face.

16:02.345 --> 16:04.179
I didn't kill my wife.

16:04.499 --> 16:06.698
And while we talk, the
real killer gets away.

16:09.170 --> 16:11.073
Did you interview
everyone else at the party?

16:11.108 --> 16:12.577
All but two.

16:13.577 --> 16:16.624
Couple from Fort Lauderdale,
a Mitch and Halle Lockhart.

16:16.659 --> 16:18.322
Pulled an early check-out this morning.

16:18.357 --> 16:19.498
You holding out on me?

16:19.533 --> 16:22.440
Well, I figured they didn't want
to lose 7K on a Caribbean cruise.

16:22.475 --> 16:24.168
I got a patrol staking out the ship.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.114
Let's hope we didn't miss the boat.

16:31.317 --> 16:32.982
Officer, I told you already.

16:33.017 --> 16:34.357
Four suitcases that size?

16:34.392 --> 16:36.618
No way that could have
fit in one of my cabs.

16:36.653 --> 16:39.022
Look, the bags left the hotel somehow.

16:39.057 --> 16:40.925
Well, probably hired a pirata.

16:41.478 --> 16:44.104
A pirate cab? No permit,
no taxes. Those guys?

16:44.139 --> 16:45.698
Yeah,  most of 'em drive
those little beaters.

16:45.733 --> 16:49.162
You know, one or two of them got
minivans big enough to handle those bags.

16:49.197 --> 16:49.969
You got a name?

16:50.792 --> 16:52.183
I don't deal with them.

16:52.218 --> 16:55.008
This is a class op. Those
guys undercut my boys.

16:55.364 --> 16:56.678
So who uses them?

16:56.713 --> 16:59.315
People who work here.
Some illegals, you know.

16:59.622 --> 17:00.896
Can't afford their own ride.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.534
Probably can't afford
cell phones, either.

17:03.569 --> 17:04.925
There a pay phone around here?

17:04.960 --> 17:05.844
Inside.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.339
Yeah, I need a van at the Agramonte.

17:21.488 --> 17:22.714
You don't have one.

17:25.404 --> 17:26.540
A van at the Agramonte.

17:27.733 --> 17:28.814
You don't have vans?

17:32.322 --> 17:33.811
Okay, do you know anyone who does?

17:35.662 --> 17:36.399
How do you spell that?

17:36.814 --> 17:37.709
Oh, yeah, I'll try them.

17:40.442 --> 17:41.316
Nice minivan.

17:41.351 --> 17:43.825
- Where you need to go, man?
- I'm with MDPD.

17:44.393 --> 17:47.175
Did you pick up a guy this
morning, had four of these bags?

17:48.174 --> 17:50.215
No.

17:50.933 --> 17:53.745
Okay, see, I've been asking around.
Everyone keeps pointing me to you.

17:54.820 --> 17:56.507
Maybe I picked him up,
I don't remember, man.

17:57.754 --> 18:01.112
I impound your vehicle, it may take
weeks to get to the bottom of this.

18:06.201 --> 18:07.811
My tax dollars at work, huh?

18:13.961 --> 18:15.130
Now, you mind?

18:26.064 --> 18:29.152
Horatio. "7785 Vera Cruz."

18:41.738 --> 18:43.241
- Ready?
- Yup.

18:43.524 --> 18:44.351
Let's go.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.003
Gentlemen, we are alone.

19:06.172 --> 19:08.236
What do we have here, Mr. Wolfe?

19:09.928 --> 19:12.266
This is the DocuPhoto 1000.

19:14.500 --> 19:16.157
Ultra-high resolution.

19:16.641 --> 19:18.395
6,000 copies per hour.

19:18.430 --> 19:20.379
Federal government's
worst nightmare, right?

19:27.054 --> 19:28.149
Do you hear something?

19:38.944 --> 19:41.712
Out the way we came. Right now.

20:16.352 --> 20:17.274
You okay, Wolfe?

20:18.113 --> 20:19.615
Uh, yeah, I think so.

20:19.650 --> 20:21.799
Okay, let's check it out.

20:29.831 --> 20:31.431
So what the hell was that?

20:33.261 --> 20:35.766
Fire from the ceiling was hypergolic.

20:35.801 --> 20:36.753
Hypergolic?

20:37.221 --> 20:39.065
Right, that sizzling sound.

20:43.851 --> 20:46.101
Hostile chemicals get
too close to each other,

20:46.136 --> 20:48.123
second they touch, exothermic reaction.

20:49.860 --> 20:51.318
I can't believe that bomb did all this.

20:51.353 --> 20:52.204
It didn't.

20:52.536 --> 20:54.432
The one up on the
ceiling was the backup.

20:55.815 --> 20:58.057
What about the primary?
There's nothing left.

20:58.092 --> 20:58.822
That's not true, either.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.634
The bomb destroys everything but itself.

21:00.669 --> 21:04.479
As an example, this charred
watch head. Take a look at that.

21:07.113 --> 21:08.256
This watch part of the bomb?

21:08.593 --> 21:10.953
Yes, it is, and it means we're at the...

21:11.590 --> 21:13.952
seat of detonation. Did you hear that?

21:22.227 --> 21:23.101
Is he alive?

21:23.472 --> 21:24.521
He's got a pulse.

21:25.573 --> 21:26.614
He's still breathing.

21:26.649 --> 21:28.278
Fire rescue right now, Wolfe.

21:28.313 --> 21:31.885
Sir? Sir? Sir?

21:40.168 --> 21:40.961
H?

21:41.781 --> 21:43.007
ID says Bart Jameson.

21:43.042 --> 21:44.486
And look what was on
the rope from his wrists.

21:44.521 --> 21:46.310
Green ink, color of money.

21:46.345 --> 21:48.310
Must have transferred when
the bomber tied him up.

21:52.551 --> 21:54.272
Looks like we found our printer.

22:09.637 --> 22:10.678
Hang on a second.

22:12.142 --> 22:13.607
Excuse me, could I
have a minute, please?

22:14.351 --> 22:15.319
Mr. Jameson?

22:16.107 --> 22:18.052
Mr. Jameson my name's Horatio Caine.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.667
Can you tell me who did this to you?

22:22.774 --> 22:24.843
I can't say. I can't.

22:26.326 --> 22:30.339
Okay, can you take a
look at this picture

22:30.374 --> 22:31.811
and tell me who that is?

22:33.518 --> 22:34.688
That's my daughter.

22:38.856 --> 22:40.809
Mr. Jameson,

22:41.574 --> 22:43.216
has somebody kidnapped your daughter?

22:46.022 --> 22:48.886
I ask you this because
we found a lock of hair,

22:49.299 --> 22:50.917
and I believe it's hers.

22:51.676 --> 22:52.797
So who took her?

22:57.352 --> 22:59.121
Call patrol and tell them

22:59.156 --> 23:01.288
to meet us at Mr. Jameson's house.

23:02.156 --> 23:03.246
You hang in there.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.693
Miami Dade Police.

23:36.243 --> 23:38.364
It's not too late to
let her go, my friend.

23:39.056 --> 23:40.449
You're the one that needs to go.

23:52.870 --> 23:54.658
It's too late for me to leave.

23:56.554 --> 23:57.900
Please, help me.

23:59.862 --> 24:00.623
Let her go.

24:00.658 --> 24:03.792
Walk away, or I will blow her head off.

24:15.274 --> 24:16.723
Here's what I want you to do.

24:17.946 --> 24:19.106
I want you...

24:20.523 --> 24:22.050
to let her go.

24:25.191 --> 24:26.472
Say good-bye to the policeman...

24:33.518 --> 24:34.520
Here you go, ma'am.

24:37.582 --> 24:38.758
Okay, ma'am.

24:39.654 --> 24:40.421
Okay.

24:41.383 --> 24:42.958
You're all right.

24:51.095 --> 24:55.056
- We have no I.D. on the dead guy.
- I am not surprised.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.938
Make sure you get his ten card, okay?

24:58.498 --> 25:00.340
Maybe the printer will
tell us who he is now.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.195
Yes.

25:02.548 --> 25:03.757
We're gonna find out.

25:04.985 --> 25:06.377
Mr. Jameson?

25:06.790 --> 25:08.148
Could I have a word, please?

25:08.895 --> 25:10.358
Would you come with me, please?

25:13.820 --> 25:15.247
Does he seem familiar?

25:17.109 --> 25:19.666
You saw what they did to my daughter.

25:19.685 --> 25:22.333
Who's next? My-my parents? My brother?

25:22.334 --> 25:23.356
Mr. Jameson, I need you to trust me.

25:23.391 --> 25:26.011
I do trust you, but they're
still out there.

25:26.336 --> 25:28.168
Not for long, all right?

25:32.218 --> 25:34.037
Thank you for coming,
Mr. and Mrs. Lockhart.

25:34.072 --> 25:35.381
I'm confused.

25:36.028 --> 25:37.597
What does this have to do with us?

25:37.632 --> 25:40.408
Our victim was at the
same Friction party as you.

25:45.896 --> 25:47.669
We just want to tie up a few loose ends.

25:50.817 --> 25:53.376
Fine. I hope it doesn't
take a long time.

25:53.411 --> 25:54.905
Our cruise leaves in seven hours.

26:27.181 --> 26:28.470
Erica Hanford.

26:30.321 --> 26:34.483
Geez. Look, I'm happy to cooperate.
But this is a little disturbing.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.852
Do you remember her?

26:36.796 --> 26:37.674
No.

26:37.709 --> 26:39.011
You sure about that?

26:39.991 --> 26:43.701
We found tissue in her teeth and
semen in her sexual assault kit.

26:43.797 --> 26:44.767
Sexual assault?

26:44.802 --> 26:47.790
Yeah, and let's not forget that
we just took a sample of your DNA.

26:53.252 --> 26:55.031
Okay, so, I had sex with her.

26:56.349 --> 26:57.549
In the service elevator.

26:58.607 --> 27:01.296
You know, we played a
little slap and tickle.

27:06.686 --> 27:07.992
A little bite and fight.

27:16.894 --> 27:18.207
You happy now?

27:20.389 --> 27:23.967
He had sex with her?
At the Friction party?

27:24.002 --> 27:26.728
- That is so not cool.
- Nice acting, lady.

27:26.974 --> 27:28.438
But your husband was cattin' around.

27:28.473 --> 27:29.974
The girl he was with showed up dead.

27:30.009 --> 27:31.961
Doesn't take a genius to
look at the jealous wife.

27:31.996 --> 27:33.458
I have never even seen her.

27:33.819 --> 27:35.894
Makes it a little hard
for me to have killed her.

27:35.929 --> 27:38.206
Mrs. Lockhart, have you ever
been in the service elevator?

27:38.441 --> 27:40.090
Ugh. No.

27:40.125 --> 27:43.217
Then can you explain why we found
your palm print on the handrail?

27:49.591 --> 27:51.671
I didn't want the party to end.

27:52.849 --> 27:54.838
A guy at the hotel said
he'd score me some E,

27:54.873 --> 27:56.461
so I followed him to the basement.

27:58.763 --> 27:59.885
Come on, it's in my locker.

28:01.810 --> 28:02.763
This guy have a name?

28:03.467 --> 28:04.507
Billy.

28:04.542 --> 28:05.690
He's a cute kid.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.833
Yeah, well, see if you think
that after we talk to him.

28:08.393 --> 28:10.145
Mrs. Lockhart, this is
going to sound strange,

28:10.180 --> 28:14.416
but most people have somewhat
matching wedding bands.

28:15.284 --> 28:17.772
You're wearing an heirloom; his is gold.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.190
We're married.

28:23.294 --> 28:25.559
Just not to each other.

28:26.646 --> 28:27.925
Where's your real husband?

28:27.960 --> 28:29.085
Ohio.

28:29.120 --> 28:31.540
Halle Lockhart's not your
real name either, is it?

28:31.575 --> 28:32.660
No.

28:33.406 --> 28:34.344
It's Webber.

28:35.595 --> 28:36.712
Halle Webber.

28:37.246 --> 28:38.871
Does your husband know any of this?

28:39.425 --> 28:41.505
Mitch and I met in college.

28:42.416 --> 28:44.090
Now, once a year,

28:44.125 --> 28:46.298
we get together for a little fun.

28:47.278 --> 28:49.734
I don't mean vanilla-
sex-with-my-husband fun.

28:49.769 --> 28:53.284
I mean swing-from-the-rafters
till-the-neighbors-call-the-cops fun.

28:53.319 --> 28:54.318
So, no.

28:54.353 --> 28:55.852
I don't tell my husband.

29:16.995 --> 29:19.614
The trace on these components
came back positive for dynamite.

29:19.649 --> 29:21.812
Consistent with the
damage in the warehouse.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.589
What I don't get is how
we could find so many

29:23.590 --> 29:25.331
hidden components in
all that destruction?

29:25.366 --> 29:26.471
Okay, here's how it works.

29:26.506 --> 29:29.031
The blast pressure
happens in two phases.

29:29.066 --> 29:30.095
Air goes out...

29:38.716 --> 29:41.155
Air has to come back toward
the seat of detonation.

29:45.417 --> 29:47.539
Hundreds of pieces.
Hundreds of answers.

29:47.574 --> 29:49.774
Bombers are creatures
of habit, aren't they?

29:49.809 --> 29:51.375
They find something they
like and they stick with it.

29:51.410 --> 29:53.276
Like this. Take a look at that.

29:54.471 --> 29:55.786
That's his signature.

29:56.304 --> 29:57.433
A cigarette butt?

30:00.061 --> 30:02.511
Oh, I get it. It's an insulator.

30:06.633 --> 30:09.046
Bomb Intelligence Network
should be able to match this.

30:09.351 --> 30:10.396
Yes, they should.

30:10.397 --> 30:12.419
Know the bomb,
know the bomber.

30:12.985 --> 30:14.917
This about my P.O.?

30:14.952 --> 30:16.379
Said my urine test is dirty.

30:16.616 --> 30:18.524
That's the least of your
problems right now.

30:18.585 --> 30:20.583
I'd like to take a look
at your wristwatch.

30:21.269 --> 30:22.272
Get a warrant.

30:22.391 --> 30:25.363
I can come over there
and take it off you if you want.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.640
It's up to you.

30:29.766 --> 30:31.941
That is a timing device, Eddie,

30:31.976 --> 30:34.538
which is a violation
of your Federal Parole.

30:34.539 --> 30:36.631
It's time to go back inside, Eddie.

30:37.009 --> 30:37.853
No big deal.

30:38.094 --> 30:40.736
Do a violation standing on my head,
catch up with some friends.

30:40.737 --> 30:42.943
Something else that you need
to take a look at.

30:44.073 --> 30:45.273
That's a cigarette filter,

30:45.274 --> 30:46.973
which is your signature, isn't it?

31:07.706 --> 31:09.062
Imagine that.

31:09.656 --> 31:11.310
It's the same brand.

31:13.382 --> 31:14.883
So we are no longer talking

31:14.885 --> 31:17.069
about a violation
of your parole, Eddie.

31:17.070 --> 31:19.195
We are talking
about attempted murder.

31:19.611 --> 31:20.726
Look...

31:23.878 --> 31:25.067
If I tell you, I want a deal.

31:25.138 --> 31:27.599
Before I discuss a deal,
I want to know everything.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.198
I needed the cash.
Friend of a friend hit me up.

31:32.471 --> 31:34.921
Do this insurance job.
Blow a print machine.

31:35.391 --> 31:36.575
Never even got paid.

31:36.715 --> 31:37.759
That seems appropriate.

31:38.141 --> 31:39.746
You left another loose end.

31:40.580 --> 31:43.646
The print shop owner
is still alive, Eddie.

31:44.919 --> 31:47.018
The man who hired you--
what's he look like?

31:47.172 --> 31:48.328
Never got a good look at him.

31:49.262 --> 31:51.263
I hope for you it was good enough.

32:37.170 --> 32:38.802
That's him? That's the guy?

32:40.047 --> 32:40.753
Yeah.

32:41.385 --> 32:42.592
You know him?

32:44.098 --> 32:45.561
Unfortunately.

32:47.489 --> 32:48.696
I had him, H--

32:49.439 --> 32:50.762
the guy who hired the bomber.

32:51.460 --> 32:52.486
I let him go.

32:53.675 --> 32:54.388
Okay.

32:55.453 --> 32:57.712
He was the pirate cabbie.
Damon Barker.

32:58.218 --> 32:59.723
Picks up fares by the Agramonte.

33:00.008 --> 33:01.479
He gave you
the warehouse, right?

33:01.850 --> 33:03.606
I was so amped up,
I just took off.

33:03.864 --> 33:06.051
Don't worry about it.
What about the license plate?

33:09.591 --> 33:10.423
Listen to me.

33:10.549 --> 33:11.450
No worries.

33:11.451 --> 33:13.277
What is the first rule of survival?

33:13.711 --> 33:14.875
Hands and eyes.

33:14.876 --> 33:15.750
Okay, so what did you see?

33:15.751 --> 33:17.564
Watch their hands.
Watch their eyes.

33:27.443 --> 33:29.950
Catcher's Marina parking
permit on the dash.

33:29.951 --> 33:31.649
Okay. Go find him.

33:38.012 --> 33:40.449
Sure my prints are on
the elevator. I work here.

33:40.475 --> 33:41.720
You work poolside, Billy.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.118
The only reason you use the
service elevator is to deliver drugs.

33:45.153 --> 33:45.747
That's crazy.

33:45.907 --> 33:47.690
Not according to Halle Lockhart.

33:47.854 --> 33:49.604
Said you scored her some E last night.

33:49.811 --> 33:51.345
She told you I scored her some E?

33:51.562 --> 33:53.084
Man, try and do someone a favor.

33:53.279 --> 33:54.572
Let me show you something.

33:57.484 --> 33:58.710
This is what I scored her.

33:59.527 --> 34:00.307
Aspirin?

34:00.326 --> 34:01.979
Must have been one
hell of a headache, too.

34:02.146 --> 34:02.982
Why's that?

34:03.243 --> 34:05.193
I told her they got aspirin
up in the penthouse.

34:05.194 --> 34:07.497
She said she needed some more,
so I brought her down here.

34:07.876 --> 34:09.306
She ground them up right over there.

34:10.476 --> 34:11.926
Said she had a hard time swallowing.

34:16.244 --> 34:17.462
Silver flecks.

34:18.146 --> 34:19.231
Where are the empties?

34:19.393 --> 34:20.167
Threw them away.

34:20.650 --> 34:21.719
You have gloves on you?

34:23.243 --> 34:24.550
But I bet Halle didn't.

34:24.753 --> 34:26.146
Is she still in custody?

34:26.581 --> 34:28.409
No, we didn't have enough to hold her.

34:28.467 --> 34:29.542
We do now.

34:30.147 --> 34:31.906
Halle Lockhart/Webber.

34:32.119 --> 34:33.760
I ran her name through the Ohio DMV.

34:33.762 --> 34:35.484
No listings anywhere in the state.

34:35.527 --> 34:38.072
Well, she lied about her
name, why not her state?

34:38.847 --> 34:41.409
All these cruise people are
from the Midwest: try Michigan.

34:41.445 --> 34:42.389
Done. Negative.

34:42.473 --> 34:44.282
- Kansas?
- And Pennsylvania.

34:44.475 --> 34:45.175
Iowa.

34:45.677 --> 34:47.168
No prints matching Halle's.

34:47.284 --> 34:48.937
The dead girl's from Indianapolis.

34:49.092 --> 34:49.960
Try Indiana.

34:50.411 --> 34:52.255
In fact, try Indianapolis.

35:00.747 --> 35:02.214
Indy DMV's got a file.

35:03.153 --> 35:06.195
6475 Elmhurst Drive.

35:06.196 --> 35:07.533
What's the zip code?

35:07.570 --> 35:09.595
46205.

35:09.847 --> 35:11.821
That's the same zip code as Erica Hanford.

35:12.169 --> 35:14.691
- Your vic from the elevator?
- It's a small world.

35:14.726 --> 35:16.766
Erica and Halle were from the same town.

35:16.767 --> 35:18.322
- Thank you.
- Okay.

35:32.607 --> 35:33.523
Halle Webber.

35:38.067 --> 35:39.294
This will take a second.

35:39.627 --> 35:42.249
You're under arrest for
the murder of Erica Hanford.

35:43.081 --> 35:44.251
You are kidding me.

35:44.579 --> 35:47.325
I told you, I never even met the woman.

35:47.516 --> 35:49.026
I find that very difficult to believe,

35:49.026 --> 35:52.297
especially since you were both
on the Shaler Elementary PTA together.

35:52.312 --> 35:55.619
Okay, so, yes, I know her,
but I didn't kill her.

35:57.546 --> 36:00.067
That's a pretty locket.
May I see it, please?

36:03.269 --> 36:05.382
- I don't have to show you a thing.
- Actually, you do.

36:05.599 --> 36:07.791
Plain sight, incidental to the arrest.

36:21.850 --> 36:24.770
White substance, just like aspirin.

36:25.511 --> 36:28.989
You were on your fantasy date with Mitch
at the Friction party when you saw Erica.

36:31.276 --> 36:32.150
Halle.

36:32.243 --> 36:33.321
Oh, my God.

36:33.552 --> 36:34.234
Who's this?

36:34.867 --> 36:35.549
Where's Jeff?

36:36.635 --> 36:38.530
Oh, um, this is Mitch.

36:39.937 --> 36:40.995
Homeroom Mom--

36:41.219 --> 36:42.037
what a player.

36:42.348 --> 36:43.732
No one's going to believe this.

36:48.194 --> 36:49.343
Must have been quite a shock.

36:53.697 --> 36:56.672
She had the biggest mouth at the PTA.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.212
And you had a big secret.

36:58.612 --> 37:00.771
My husband is a workaholic.

37:00.994 --> 37:05.500
He spends his life at that furniture
store. So once a year, I run away.

37:05.690 --> 37:06.953
And then you ran into Erica,

37:06.953 --> 37:09.457
which is exactly why you went
into the hotel basement.

37:21.950 --> 37:24.600
You knew about her allergy. You saw
her at the raw bar, and you dosed

37:24.600 --> 37:26.250
every oyster shooter you could find.

37:38.461 --> 37:41.434
I was trying to protect my family.

38:00.172 --> 38:01.135
Mr. Kayle.

38:01.218 --> 38:01.777
Lieutenant,

38:01.789 --> 38:04.852
I looked at all Wolfe's lifts
from the hotel room.

38:04.887 --> 38:05.154
And...?

38:05.436 --> 38:07.122
Nothing but smudges and partials.

38:09.162 --> 38:10.529
What about the soap?

38:11.302 --> 38:12.848
I can see some ridge detail.

38:13.144 --> 38:14.713
Going to take some time to process it.

38:14.808 --> 38:15.831
Take the time.

38:32.897 --> 38:33.524
Horatio?

38:34.181 --> 38:35.636
Yeah, I found the pirate cab.

38:36.292 --> 38:39.298
Inside there were several padlocks
from Customs and Border Protection.

38:40.070 --> 38:42.686
Okay, call CBP, and meet me at the port.

38:47.611 --> 38:50.955
These are the last four containers
going to the Caribbean.

38:55.870 --> 38:57.684
This is our new gamma ray imaging.

39:05.965 --> 39:07.766
How many suitcases are you looking for?

39:07.952 --> 39:09.606
Four. Full of counterfeit fifties.

39:09.624 --> 39:11.723
Around $10 million.

39:16.904 --> 39:19.207
Got about a hundred cases of bottles.

39:22.670 --> 39:24.713
There-- four suitcases.

39:27.091 --> 39:29.116
Manifest says Jeunet champagne.

39:29.230 --> 39:30.268
Okay, let's open it up.

39:35.038 --> 39:36.826
That lock shouldn't even be on yet.

39:37.137 --> 39:39.255
Mr. Wolfe, have a look around, please.

39:41.650 --> 39:43.462
My paperwork doesn't
show that Customs and

39:43.485 --> 39:45.691
Border Protection has
inspected this container.

40:02.426 --> 40:03.958
Cabbie's van looked abandoned.

40:04.098 --> 40:06.327
Bet he was planning
to meet the cash in Jamaica.

40:13.490 --> 40:14.744
Mr. Barker.

40:18.601 --> 40:19.344
Gentlemen,

40:19.501 --> 40:21.938
Mr. Barker wants to go for a swim.

40:22.773 --> 40:23.985
You're under arrest.

40:24.033 --> 40:24.615
For what?

40:24.723 --> 40:27.067
Counterfeiting, explosives,
attempted murder.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.776
And that's just for starters.

40:30.786 --> 40:32.557
First we got your partner, Juan.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.149
Now we've got you and all
of the counterfeit money.

40:39.447 --> 40:41.433
Joseph got a print from the hotel soap,

40:41.433 --> 40:43.259
and it doesn't match the pirate cabbie.

40:43.303 --> 40:45.022
But guess who it does match?

40:47.856 --> 40:49.580
You lied to me, Juan.

40:50.341 --> 40:51.304
What are you talking about?

40:51.438 --> 40:54.586
Your friend, the cabbie, said you
called him from the hotel room.

40:54.621 --> 40:56.533
And he said you needed a ride, fast.

41:05.453 --> 41:06.820
I told you before.

41:07.034 --> 41:08.710
I just dropped the bags off.

41:09.115 --> 41:10.934
I never went inside.

41:11.956 --> 41:14.215
Soap from the shower

41:15.357 --> 41:17.021
says otherwise.

41:18.537 --> 41:20.617
Juan, that's your print.

41:20.784 --> 41:22.103
That means you were there.

41:24.352 --> 41:25.720
You killed the bellman.

41:33.987 --> 41:34.829
All right.

41:35.380 --> 41:36.280
All right.

41:37.789 --> 41:39.270
Can I help myself here?

41:39.879 --> 41:41.998
Fair enough. I need your contact inside.

41:41.998 --> 41:45.307
I need her name,
and I don't want Fulana Perez.

41:45.517 --> 41:46.576
Let's go.

41:47.821 --> 41:49.363
Shakespeare.

41:53.846 --> 41:56.398
- Can I interview him now?
- No need.

41:56.516 --> 41:57.707
Voila.

41:59.859 --> 42:01.531
Paz Gaspara?

42:01.636 --> 42:03.233
Yeah, she's from outside Trenton.

42:03.238 --> 42:05.426
She works for a company
that dispatches money trucks.

42:05.427 --> 42:08.124
She and Juan met at Krome.

42:08.653 --> 42:10.801
Were going to counterfeit their
way into the American dream.

42:10.836 --> 42:12.726
I guess they picked the
wrong city, didn't they?

42:13.423 --> 42:14.820
And the wrong partners.

42:16.782 --> 42:18.105
What are you doing?

42:19.225 --> 42:20.188
He's a federal prisoner now.

42:20.189 --> 42:21.008
We're taking custody.

42:21.393 --> 42:23.201
He printed over ten million
in counterfeit fifties.

42:23.225 --> 42:24.738
And obstructed the investigation.

42:24.743 --> 42:27.003
Yes, in an attempt to help his family.

42:27.752 --> 42:30.105
Do I need to remind you,
I represent the federal government?

42:30.406 --> 42:33.343
And do I need to remind you
that your lab in D.C.

42:33.343 --> 42:35.146
is over a thousand miles from here.

42:35.146 --> 42:37.155
If you want access to my lab...

42:37.899 --> 42:39.253
Are you planning to bar us?

42:39.550 --> 42:40.540
Put it this way:

42:40.737 --> 42:43.256
I can make things very difficult for you.

42:47.663 --> 42:49.921
- I won't forget this.
- I'm counting on it.

42:50.787 --> 42:51.584
Cut him loose.

42:52.902 --> 42:54.150
You keep in touch.

43:03.401 --> 43:04.263
How's your daughter?

43:04.545 --> 43:05.229
She's good,

43:05.630 --> 43:06.640
thanks to you.

43:07.502 --> 43:08.810
So, what's going to happen to me?

43:08.855 --> 43:11.441
Well, this officer is going
to give you a ride home.

43:11.540 --> 43:13.064
But they said I was under arrest.

43:13.079 --> 43:14.418
That's not going to happen now.

43:14.491 --> 43:15.037
But....

43:15.092 --> 43:16.775
So go home to your family,

43:17.232 --> 43:18.002
okay?

43:20.941 --> 43:22.340
Lieutenant, um...

43:23.695 --> 43:24.735
Go ahead.

43:25.954 --> 43:27.128
Thank you.
