00:00.896 --> 00:03.063
Welcome to Barbados.

00:03.565 --> 00:05.832
All visitors please proceed...

00:05.834 --> 00:09.736
Ok, come on.
It's not much farther.

00:09.738 --> 00:11.237
How about a piggyback ride?

00:11.239 --> 00:12.739
I will fall over.

00:12.741 --> 00:15.675
But it's just so heavy.

00:15.677 --> 00:17.410
Yeah, right. Ok.

00:17.412 --> 00:18.745
Thanks, Mom.

00:19.580 --> 00:20.847
There's no Wifi.

00:20.849 --> 00:22.448
There'll be some
at the hotel.

00:22.450 --> 00:24.684
I told grandma I'd text her
when we landed.

00:24.686 --> 00:27.020
Yes, but this trip isn't about texting,
it's about unplugging.

00:27.022 --> 00:29.556
So you're not gonna be
on your phone at all?

00:29.558 --> 00:31.024
Please don't do this.
I have such a pounding headache.

00:31.026 --> 00:34.827
Your allergies,
they're the worst.

00:38.033 --> 00:39.766
All right, check it out,
buddy.

00:39.768 --> 00:42.669
7 pools, 9 waterslides,

00:42.671 --> 00:44.804
a mile-long lazy river,

00:44.806 --> 00:47.440
and if you dare,
there's roaring rapids.

00:47.442 --> 00:49.075
Don't forget about
the dolphins.

00:49.077 --> 00:50.577
Oh, yeah. Did you make
that reservation?

00:50.579 --> 00:52.345
10 a.m. tomorrow.

00:52.347 --> 00:53.680
Can we surf on them?

00:53.682 --> 00:54.647
Yeah.

00:54.649 --> 00:56.049
No.
No.

00:56.051 --> 00:57.584
Ah, here we go.
Yeah, yeah, that's...

00:57.586 --> 00:58.818
Yay.

01:05.159 --> 01:06.659
Oh, no.

01:08.762 --> 01:11.297
Website said the last
shuttle left at 10:00.

01:11.299 --> 01:12.765
I lost track of time.

01:12.767 --> 01:14.167
Want to take a taxi?

01:14.169 --> 01:15.501
No, we have too much stuff.

01:15.503 --> 01:17.303
We'll never fit.
We'd have to take two cabs.

01:17.305 --> 01:18.838
It's late.
I don't want to split up.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.640
Ok. Ok.

01:20.642 --> 01:22.408
Ok.
Oh, hang on.

01:23.444 --> 01:26.379
Hey, how much to take us
to the Grand Royal?

01:26.381 --> 01:28.615
I hope this guy
can take us.

01:28.617 --> 01:29.582
Thanks.

01:29.584 --> 01:32.685
This guy, 45 minutes,
45 bucks.

01:32.687 --> 01:34.787
Great.

01:36.757 --> 01:38.591
Hop in, kids.

01:45.566 --> 01:48.067
There's complimentary
water in the cooler.

01:48.069 --> 01:49.669
Oh, thanks.

01:49.671 --> 01:52.005
Hey, guys,
get these down, ok?

01:52.007 --> 01:53.506
Mm-hmm?
Honey?

01:53.508 --> 01:56.409
This is the best way to avoid any bugs
you got on the plane.

01:56.411 --> 01:57.577
Mm.

01:58.746 --> 02:02.515
Driver: So where you guys from?

02:02.517 --> 02:04.350
Uh, D.C. area.

02:04.352 --> 02:05.551
You ever been?

02:05.553 --> 02:06.753
When I was a kid, yeah.

02:06.755 --> 02:08.288
Loved the museums.

02:08.289 --> 02:10.490
We got some good places
around here you should check out.

02:10.491 --> 02:12.659
Your kids into history?

02:12.661 --> 02:14.027
Sure.

02:14.029 --> 02:16.062
I'll make you a list.

02:16.064 --> 02:17.497
Thanks, that'd be great.

02:21.469 --> 02:24.370
Hey, I think Al's upset
we didn't get her that plan.

02:24.372 --> 02:26.839
Can we fix that tomorrow?

02:26.841 --> 02:30.043
Greg.

02:30.045 --> 02:31.844
Greg.

02:31.846 --> 02:32.879
Greg.

02:32.881 --> 02:34.047
Everything ok?

02:34.049 --> 02:37.016
Yeah. It's a gift.
He can fall asleep anywhere.

02:39.386 --> 02:42.522
Come on, you guys. Hello!

02:42.524 --> 02:44.657
This isn't funny. Wake up.

02:51.498 --> 02:53.599
Greg?

02:53.601 --> 02:54.867
Greg!

02:54.869 --> 02:56.869
Greg!

02:56.871 --> 02:59.872
Ok, something's wrong.
You need to pull over.

03:01.775 --> 03:03.443
Where are you going?!

03:03.445 --> 03:06.679
Where are you going?!

03:34.242 --> 03:37.543
The Sullivan family disappeared
in Barbados 8 hours ago.

03:37.545 --> 03:39.445
From the airport?

03:39.447 --> 03:41.147
How old
are the children?

03:41.149 --> 03:42.548
10 and 14.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.884
Here we go again.

03:44.886 --> 03:46.919
Barbados? Americans
on foreign soil

03:46.921 --> 03:48.588
is Jack Garrett's territory.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.323
Cruz says
there's more to it.

03:50.325 --> 03:51.591
How you been, Jack?

03:51.593 --> 03:54.927
Busy. I wish this
was under better circumstances.

03:54.929 --> 03:57.096
Want to fill us in?

03:58.065 --> 03:59.632
All right,

03:59.634 --> 04:02.101
one last thing.

04:02.103 --> 04:04.470
We know that you're all
at the top of your class,

04:04.472 --> 04:07.807
but any ideas on why I
chose you for this rotation?

04:07.809 --> 04:09.475
Our knowledge
of international law?

04:09.477 --> 04:11.444
Well, that certainly helps.

04:11.446 --> 04:14.647
But your essays revealed
moments that forever changed

04:14.649 --> 04:16.182
the way you look
at the world.

04:16.184 --> 04:18.885
It's your passion for justice.
That's why you're here.

04:18.887 --> 04:20.420
That's what you need
to hold on to.

04:20.422 --> 04:22.188
All right, send me
your thoughts

04:22.190 --> 04:24.957
on the anti-kidnapping initiative
and we will discuss next time.

04:24.959 --> 04:25.959
Thanks, Agent Lambert.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.360
It's Lily.

04:28.996 --> 04:30.830
Jack's on his way.
Wants to debrief in five.

04:30.832 --> 04:31.964
Where's the case?

04:31.966 --> 04:34.167
Barbados.
Family's been kidnapped.

04:34.169 --> 04:35.601
Ok, I need the legal
statutes.

04:35.603 --> 04:36.869
You are the best.

04:36.871 --> 04:38.304
Ambassador's on line 2.

04:38.306 --> 04:41.774
Oh, and see if the Caribbean court
has any revisions.

04:41.776 --> 04:43.042
Ambassador.

04:43.044 --> 04:44.177
Yes, we just heard.

04:45.313 --> 04:46.979
Absolutely.

04:46.981 --> 04:48.114
Matt, hold on.

04:48.116 --> 04:50.616
We'll call you from
the tarmac with our ETA.

04:50.618 --> 04:52.318
See you soon.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.820
How far away are you?

04:53.822 --> 04:55.188
I just left the house.

04:55.190 --> 04:56.556
Matt is 20 minutes away.

04:56.558 --> 04:57.557
Well, tell him he's driving.

04:57.559 --> 04:58.559
Did you hear that?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.792
Yeah. Copy that.

05:00.594 --> 05:02.628
Cruz briefed
Hotch and Rossi.

05:02.630 --> 05:05.164
Is he gathering
the rest of the BAU?

05:05.166 --> 05:07.467
As we speak. Everything
ready in Barbados?

05:07.469 --> 05:09.168
It's coordinated
with the ambassador.

05:09.170 --> 05:10.303
Great.

05:10.305 --> 05:11.971
Our unsub's eluded
both domestic

05:11.973 --> 05:13.439
and international
teams,

05:13.441 --> 05:15.942
and we're not about
to let him get away with it again.

05:15.944 --> 05:17.376
As you all remember,

05:17.378 --> 05:20.112
last April the Isaacs family
was killed in Florida,

05:20.114 --> 05:22.648
and the Everetts were killed in Aruba
the year before that.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.984
Both families were found
24 hours after they were taken.

05:24.986 --> 05:26.486
Each family member
had been strangled

05:26.488 --> 05:28.020
and their bodies were dumped
in a remote area.

05:28.022 --> 05:29.055
The trails went cold.

05:29.057 --> 05:30.490
All signs pointed
to the Everetts

05:30.492 --> 05:31.691
being his first victims.

05:31.693 --> 05:34.527
Because of the hands-on,
intimate nature of the kills,

05:34.529 --> 05:36.128
we thought
it was personal.

05:36.130 --> 05:38.564
And we built on that theory
with the Isaacs in Florida, but to no avail.

05:38.566 --> 05:40.299
Now that he's moved
internationally again,

05:40.301 --> 05:42.201
it's time to rethink
the motive.

05:42.203 --> 05:44.937
It's clear he gets off
on hunting American families

05:44.939 --> 05:46.339
when they're on vacation.

05:46.341 --> 05:50.476
Just over 8 hours ago he abducted
the Sullivans from Barbados.

05:50.478 --> 05:52.011
It feels like he's
establishing a clear pattern.

05:52.013 --> 05:53.679
He started overseas,
came back to the states,

05:53.681 --> 05:55.147
and now he's gone
to another country again.

05:55.149 --> 05:57.183
The month of April
has some sort of significance to him.

05:57.185 --> 05:59.218
Maybe it's easy
hunting season.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.054
All the kills were during
spring break vacations.

06:02.056 --> 06:04.123
It takes guts and skill
to snatch a whole family,

06:04.125 --> 06:05.491
but you wouldn't know it
by watching him.

06:05.493 --> 06:07.927
Rossi: The higher the risk,
the lower his heart rate.

06:07.929 --> 06:09.295
A true sociopath.

06:09.297 --> 06:11.364
And the family's too tired
from a long day of travel

06:11.366 --> 06:12.465
to see the ruse.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.900
And the unsub's probably
too charismatic

06:13.902 --> 06:15.701
to set off any
instinctual alarms.

06:15.703 --> 06:19.272
Cruz: I need both domestic and international
teams working together on this.

06:19.274 --> 06:20.640
If our unsub
sticks to his pattern,

06:20.642 --> 06:22.174
he'll kill the Sullivans
by sunrise.

06:22.176 --> 06:24.810
Kate, you and Reid go to the
Sullivans' house in Fairfax county.

06:24.812 --> 06:27.647
Look for links between
them and the other victims.

06:27.649 --> 06:29.649
We need to establish whether
he's stalking them at their homes

06:29.651 --> 06:30.983
before
they take their trips.

06:30.985 --> 06:33.185
The rest of us
will head to Barbados.

06:34.488 --> 06:36.322
Sir, we don't have
a lot of time.

06:36.324 --> 06:38.324
Please tell me Monty's
on this with us.

06:38.326 --> 06:42.161
Yes, he's on his way.
Agent Simmons will be with us.

06:42.163 --> 06:44.263
So, our jet or yours?

06:44.265 --> 06:46.332
We'll flip for it.

3 families, 3 countries
in 3 years.

08:02.355 --> 08:03.755
This guy's on a mission.

08:03.757 --> 08:05.523
What's he trying
to prove?

08:05.525 --> 08:07.158
Each kill makes him feel
more empowered.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.627
He's addicted to it.
Thinks he's invincible.

08:09.629 --> 08:10.695
Well, he isn't.

08:10.697 --> 08:12.864
Hey, hey, haven't seen
you guys in a while.

08:12.866 --> 08:14.165
Morgan: Matt Simmons.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.666
Passing ships, man.
How you doing?

08:15.668 --> 08:16.701
Good.
Hi.

08:16.703 --> 08:18.936
Morgan, you married yet.

08:18.938 --> 08:20.171
Working on it.

08:20.173 --> 08:22.173
So, uh, how old's
the baby now?

08:22.175 --> 08:24.242
Which one?
He's quite a breeder.

08:24.244 --> 08:26.110
I have 4 under 3.

08:26.112 --> 08:27.112
Wow.

08:27.113 --> 08:28.179
Last round was twins.

08:28.181 --> 08:30.081
Oh, my god.
Your wife is a saint.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.582
That she is.

08:45.998 --> 08:48.466
So you know what I thought
was weird about Florida

08:48.468 --> 08:51.302
is that there were no drugs
found in any of the victims' systems,

08:51.304 --> 08:54.205
which is strange, because I figured
that's how he was controlling them.

08:54.207 --> 08:55.673
Yeah, I thought the same
thing in Aruba.

08:55.675 --> 08:57.208
Nothing showed up
in the tox screen.

08:57.210 --> 09:01.379
But their metabolism could have
gone through a hypno in a few hours.

09:01.381 --> 09:04.015
True. It's easy, cheap,
efficient.

09:04.017 --> 09:05.450
He used some kind
of leather ligature

09:05.452 --> 09:06.818
to beat them
and finish the job.

09:06.820 --> 09:08.219
Our guess was a belt.

09:08.221 --> 09:09.787
It must mean something
to him.

09:09.789 --> 09:11.122
Well, that weapon
versus bare hands

09:11.124 --> 09:12.690
certainly prolongs
the strangulation.

09:12.692 --> 09:16.627
He gets off on controlling
their lives until the very end.

09:16.629 --> 09:18.296
He could have kept
hunting in Florida.

09:18.298 --> 09:20.398
It's a target rich
environment for his type.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.266
Right. But he didn't.

09:22.268 --> 09:24.969
Instead he chose Barbados,
of all places.

09:24.971 --> 09:27.138
More couples than families
who vacation there.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.607
He's making it harder
on himself.

09:29.609 --> 09:31.075
And us.

09:31.077 --> 09:33.344
There's not much going on
here evidence wise.

09:33.346 --> 09:34.545
Except those ball caps.

09:34.547 --> 09:36.681
The first two times
he wore orange,

09:36.683 --> 09:38.316
now he's switched to blue.

09:38.318 --> 09:40.318
Bonjour, crime-fighters
times two. Ok,

09:40.320 --> 09:41.652
I did some digging
on the Sullivans

09:41.654 --> 09:43.454
and they just got
their passports.

09:43.456 --> 09:45.523
This trip was their
first stamp.

09:45.525 --> 09:47.558
Inexperienced travelers
tend to make the easiest targets

09:47.560 --> 09:50.328
because they're isolated,
they're stressed from customs,

09:50.330 --> 09:52.597
sometimes there's even
a language barrier.

09:52.599 --> 09:54.465
And all those unfamiliar
sights and sounds

09:54.467 --> 09:56.000
add to their culture shock.

09:56.002 --> 09:57.602
Yeah, that's why airports
are the biggest trap.

09:57.604 --> 10:00.171
A few creature comforts,
ATMs, restaurants,

10:00.173 --> 10:02.507
they trick you into
letting your guard down.

10:02.509 --> 10:03.975
There are predators
waiting to strike.

10:03.977 --> 10:06.844
Yeah, well, I ran their specs through
ViCAP and Interpol again,

10:06.846 --> 10:08.346
and the only things
that are dinging

10:08.348 --> 10:09.814
are the suitcases
we already know about.

10:09.816 --> 10:11.782
Garcia, coordinate with
the State department

10:11.784 --> 10:14.252
on passport activity in Barbados
and cross that with Aruba

10:14.254 --> 10:15.786
copy, copy.
From a few years ago.

10:16.789 --> 10:19.157
Monty, Monty!

10:19.159 --> 10:21.726
You come here to me. Oh!

10:21.728 --> 10:22.960
You can put yourself there.

10:22.962 --> 10:24.195
All right.

10:24.197 --> 10:26.664
Greg Sullivan's parents
just checked in downstairs.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.466
Yeah? And?

10:28.468 --> 10:30.868
The ones
who called this in.

10:32.871 --> 10:35.072
Would you like
to meet them?

10:35.074 --> 10:36.174
Oh, I don't do--

10:36.176 --> 10:39.944
I thought that you
just stayed back

10:39.946 --> 10:42.046
with the T-1 line like me.
Is that something you do all the time?

10:42.048 --> 10:44.382
Yeah. Since my team's
usually an ocean away,

10:44.384 --> 10:46.150
it means that
I'm the only one here

10:46.152 --> 10:48.553
to let the loved ones know
we're doing the best we can.

10:48.555 --> 10:51.022
What if it's not
a happy thing?

10:52.591 --> 10:54.559
Then it's a really bad day.

10:54.561 --> 10:57.261
Wow. That sounds lonely.

10:57.263 --> 10:58.796
Sometimes it is,

10:58.798 --> 11:01.165
but we're not going
to think about that right now,

11:01.167 --> 11:03.000
because what
this family needs

11:03.002 --> 11:04.602
is a little sunshine.

11:04.604 --> 11:05.870
Ok.

11:05.872 --> 11:07.505
Come on. Let's do this.

11:07.507 --> 11:09.640
Ok.

11:09.642 --> 11:11.642
You're the only person
I'd do this with.

11:11.644 --> 11:15.613
Updated alarm system, no dog doors
or hidden points of entry.

11:15.615 --> 11:17.515
Garage is even detached.
I don't think the unsub

11:17.517 --> 11:19.183
infiltrated this house
without them knowing.

11:19.185 --> 11:20.818
Is this the stuff
you got from Florida?

11:20.820 --> 11:23.721
Well, all the families took the
same cautious approach while traveling.

11:23.723 --> 11:26.090
So, he didn't stalk them
from home, he did it from Barbados.

11:26.092 --> 11:27.892
Probably tracked
the flights on his phone,

11:27.894 --> 11:30.061
saw the delays, and
knew that he'd found his victim type.

11:30.063 --> 11:31.762
Yeah, obviously
he has a clear ideal.

11:31.764 --> 11:33.998
Statistically,
annihilators are fathers

11:34.000 --> 11:35.366
who've lost or killed
their own families

11:35.368 --> 11:36.834
and are trying to replace
their role in the unit.

11:36.836 --> 11:39.337
Ok, so let's see what type
of father he wants to be.

11:39.339 --> 11:42.640
My guess is the M.E.
report will support your theory.

12:04.196 --> 12:05.196
It's good to see you.

12:05.198 --> 12:06.664
Jack, how you been?

12:06.666 --> 12:07.732
Great, thanks.

12:07.734 --> 12:09.867
Of course you know
Lambert and Simmons.

12:09.869 --> 12:12.637
This is the embassy's
regional security officer.

12:12.639 --> 12:14.772
Fitz, this is the team
I was telling you about.

12:14.774 --> 12:17.008
SSAs Hotchner, Rossi,

12:17.010 --> 12:19.143
Morgan, and Jareau.

12:19.145 --> 12:20.911
They're experts
in family annihilators

12:20.913 --> 12:22.747
and worked this
offender's case last year.

12:22.749 --> 12:24.348
Well, I hate that it takes
another abduction

12:24.350 --> 12:25.783
to bring out
all the big guns,

12:25.785 --> 12:26.951
but I'm glad you're here.

12:26.953 --> 12:29.287
Come on in.
I'll show you around.

12:29.289 --> 12:31.956
The ambassador
wants to keep this quiet.

12:31.958 --> 12:35.026
'Cause he doesn't want the host
government to be embarrassed.

12:35.028 --> 12:37.061
10,000 Americans victimized
overseas each year

12:37.063 --> 12:38.996
and State's worried
about diplomacy.

12:38.998 --> 12:40.498
In this case,
it's island economics.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.033
Anything that stops
money from coming in

12:42.035 --> 12:43.668
gets swept under
the rug.

12:43.670 --> 12:46.537
Other places, challenges
can be more political.

12:46.539 --> 12:48.539
If we thought other families
were in danger,

12:48.541 --> 12:50.107
I'd argue that we should
make a statement,

12:50.109 --> 12:51.842
but I think this guy
has what he wants.

12:51.844 --> 12:53.010
Matt: What about the van?

12:53.012 --> 12:55.413
Tags were stolen.
Registered to a rotting VW bus.

12:55.415 --> 12:56.914
Of course.

12:56.916 --> 12:58.449
And the make, model,
and color all match

12:58.451 --> 13:00.951
a popular service van on the island.
They're a dime a dozen.

13:00.953 --> 13:02.953
And what about the driver?
Are there a lot of Americans

13:02.955 --> 13:04.655
driving shuttles
around here?

13:04.657 --> 13:07.391
Half the service industry are expats
who work here all winter.

13:07.393 --> 13:10.294
Problem is, most people don't report
their presence in the embassy,

13:10.296 --> 13:13.331
so we have no record
of knowing who's even here.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.700
Well, he's been here long enough to know
his way around back roads.

13:15.702 --> 13:17.635
This kind of ruse isn't
easy to pull off at night.

13:17.637 --> 13:20.504
Our technical analysts
are tracking passport activity

13:20.506 --> 13:22.073
over the past 6 months.

13:22.075 --> 13:23.507
That's a good start.

13:23.509 --> 13:25.109
Morgan, you an JJ should
head to the abduction site.

13:25.111 --> 13:26.777
Simmons, go ahead
and join them.

13:26.779 --> 13:28.646
I'm gonna run leads
in town. You want to come?

13:28.648 --> 13:30.448
Great.
Sounds good.

13:30.450 --> 13:33.684
And then there were two.

13:33.686 --> 13:36.821
It seems like you've got
a great team there.

13:36.823 --> 13:38.556
So do you.

13:38.558 --> 13:40.458
If the pattern holds,

13:40.460 --> 13:44.028
we've only got 12 hours
to find them alive.

14:19.532 --> 14:23.100
Woman:
Olly olly oxen free.

14:23.102 --> 14:25.336
Olly olly oxen free!

14:25.338 --> 14:27.805
Olly olly oxen free!

14:27.807 --> 14:30.040
Man: Look at me!

14:30.042 --> 14:33.144
You ruin everything!

14:33.146 --> 14:36.847
Greg! Greg, help us!

14:36.849 --> 14:38.482
Colleen!

14:38.484 --> 14:41.585
Greg, help us!

14:41.587 --> 14:43.854
Man: I'll show you!

14:43.856 --> 14:44.955
Stop crying!

14:44.957 --> 14:46.357
Daddy, please!

14:46.359 --> 14:47.825
No, daddy!

14:53.131 --> 14:55.132
It's our job
to protected them.

14:55.134 --> 14:58.469
No matter how old they are,
they're still our children.

14:58.471 --> 15:01.572
Oh, my goodness.
No, you can't blame yourself.

15:01.574 --> 15:04.041
Last year, around
this same time,

15:04.043 --> 15:07.645
I read this story
about this family in Florida.

15:07.647 --> 15:09.747
They also
were on vacation.

15:09.749 --> 15:13.584
Oh, please, just tell us
it wasn't the same monster.

15:13.586 --> 15:18.889
Men like that
seem like monsters.

15:18.891 --> 15:21.091
But they're
actually human.

15:21.093 --> 15:23.794
And our teams are the best
at seeing that difference.

15:23.796 --> 15:27.198
That's why I know
we'll find who has your family.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.700
Now, is there anything
you can tell us about Greg

15:29.702 --> 15:31.168
or Colleen or the the kids,

15:31.170 --> 15:33.437
anything that can help
find this man?

15:33.439 --> 15:36.207
Greg won't let anyone
hurt his family.

15:36.209 --> 15:38.309
Not without
a hell of a fight.

15:38.311 --> 15:39.643
Good.

15:39.645 --> 15:43.080
See, that's--that's good.

15:47.919 --> 15:50.888
You just said that
Greg being a fighter is a good thing,

15:50.890 --> 15:52.923
and we both know
that that is not true.

15:52.925 --> 15:55.626
The unsub is gonna see it
as some sort of Alpha male challenge,

15:55.628 --> 15:57.094
which is not good
at all.

15:57.096 --> 15:58.395
I know.

15:58.397 --> 16:00.965
But right now they
need to feel hopeful.

16:02.801 --> 16:05.436
Ok. I hadn't thought
of that.

16:06.238 --> 16:07.571
There's plenty
of hidden cameras,

16:07.573 --> 16:09.440
but no sign
of the unsub inside.

16:09.442 --> 16:11.075
He must have waited
in the van

16:11.077 --> 16:13.344
and got a view of
the Sullivans from there.

16:13.346 --> 16:14.979
Or weather caused a delay,

16:14.981 --> 16:16.413
which made them miss
the shuttle.

16:16.415 --> 16:18.582
There's no way the unsub
planned any of that.

16:18.584 --> 16:20.317
It says a lot that
his victim ideals

16:20.319 --> 16:22.887
matter more
than when he strikes.

16:22.889 --> 16:25.256
So in each case, he watched,
he waited, and hunted

16:25.258 --> 16:26.991
until the right family
came along.

16:26.993 --> 16:29.627
This bastard's been
searching for his next vics.

16:29.629 --> 16:31.428
He's been here
before last night.

16:31.430 --> 16:32.763
He's been building his trap.

16:32.765 --> 16:35.299
The only thing he hadn't
planned was who he'd take.

16:35.301 --> 16:37.968
We need to check footage
going back to the first of April.

16:45.610 --> 16:47.578
I have 15 vans like that

16:47.580 --> 16:49.113
and lots of drivers
from the states,

16:49.115 --> 16:50.614
but I don't know him.

16:50.616 --> 16:51.616
Ok. Thanks.

16:51.617 --> 16:52.816
Thank you.

16:52.818 --> 16:54.685
Have you traveled much
with your son?

16:54.687 --> 16:56.253
Not a lot, no.

16:56.255 --> 16:57.688
Have you ever wanted
to just lock him away

16:57.690 --> 16:59.189
until the world's
a safe place?

16:59.191 --> 17:01.191
Then he'd never get out.
Yeah.

17:01.193 --> 17:02.693
Last time I saw you,
you said

17:02.695 --> 17:04.228
there was a lead
in your brother's case.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.462
Oh, it was a dead end.

17:05.464 --> 17:06.829
He's in Thailand, right?

17:06.832 --> 17:09.333
Yeah. Classic naive
American abroad for the first time.

17:09.335 --> 17:11.001
Victimization is the last
thing on his mind

17:11.002 --> 17:14.003
because he thought carrying
a U.S. passport meant he was protected.

17:14.006 --> 17:15.204
Any other suspects?

17:15.207 --> 17:17.207
I've been trying
to put the pieces together,

17:17.209 --> 17:19.910
but the few postcards I got
before it all went sideways

17:19.912 --> 17:21.545
painted this grand adventure.

17:21.547 --> 17:23.547
I keep looking at
who was in his stories.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.683
Was it the girl
he wrote about?

17:25.685 --> 17:27.384
Was it the guys he went
rock climbing with?

17:27.386 --> 17:29.053
Someone knew he was
the perfect patsy

17:29.055 --> 17:32.089
and they framed him.

17:32.091 --> 17:35.593
If you ever want me to take
a look at the case, I'd be happy to.

17:35.595 --> 17:37.561
Thanks, Hotch.

17:37.563 --> 17:39.363
A fresh pair of eyes
would be great.

17:39.365 --> 17:41.732
I'll take you up on that.

17:54.446 --> 17:55.946
Excuse me.

18:01.186 --> 18:03.387
Hey, ladies,
you need a ride?

18:03.389 --> 18:04.521
Is this your van?

18:04.523 --> 18:06.857
No, not one of mine.

18:06.859 --> 18:08.892
I give you a ride
anywhere.

18:08.894 --> 18:09.994
Best cabs in town.

18:09.996 --> 18:13.364
Yes. Ok. What you want
to do is make a left...

18:13.366 --> 18:14.398
Hotch: Lily.

18:16.435 --> 18:18.202
Hotch: Go left!

18:37.122 --> 18:38.856
No weapon.

18:38.858 --> 18:41.959
Cash and cocaine.

18:41.961 --> 18:43.260
Lily: Any I.D.?

18:48.767 --> 18:49.800
He just got here.

18:49.802 --> 18:52.536
It's not him.

18:54.272 --> 18:56.106
He's all yours.

18:59.612 --> 19:02.479
Please, daddy, stop!

19:02.481 --> 19:03.881
I won't do it again!

19:03.883 --> 19:05.983
It's always your fault!

19:05.985 --> 19:07.551
I can't breathe!

19:15.994 --> 19:17.161
Thanks, Garcia.

19:17.163 --> 19:20.064
The dynamic duo narrowed it down
to 1,000 Americans

19:20.066 --> 19:23.233
who visited Aruba and Barbados,
but they need our help.

19:23.235 --> 19:24.868
Want to search visas?

19:24.870 --> 19:27.571
Americans don't need
a visa here.

19:27.573 --> 19:30.240
Well, damn.

19:30.242 --> 19:31.608
Where's your head?

19:31.610 --> 19:33.210
Well, this guy needs
privacy,

19:33.212 --> 19:34.678
and he's got
a lot of it here.

19:34.680 --> 19:37.514
There's hundreds of acres
of undeveloped and isolated land.

19:37.516 --> 19:40.918
So he knows the area well enough
to cover his tracks.

19:44.923 --> 19:47.091
No!

20:08.086 --> 20:09.586
Ok.

20:09.588 --> 20:13.757
We have tastes from England, Portugal,
Spain, and west Africa.

20:13.759 --> 20:16.727
And this is my absolute
favorite, flying fish.

20:16.729 --> 20:18.295
Do you guys eat like
this wherever you go?

20:18.297 --> 20:19.763
Pretty much.

20:19.765 --> 20:22.232
If you ever need another consultation,
you know where to find me.

20:22.234 --> 20:23.634
So you said
there was good news?

20:23.636 --> 20:25.269
Yeah, Garcia and Monty
sent us some footage.

20:25.271 --> 20:27.070
It should be on both screens.

20:27.072 --> 20:28.309
We got this guy trolling

20:28.333 --> 20:30.855
inside and outside the terminal
over the past two weeks.

20:31.043 --> 20:33.110
He's focused on families at night,
when they're exhausted.

20:33.112 --> 20:34.745
But there's this.

20:34.747 --> 20:37.114
Morgan: Yeah,
and clock his footwork.

20:37.116 --> 20:39.650
Ok, that move would have
sent me to my masseuse.

20:39.652 --> 20:40.984
This guy's athletic
and he's strong.

20:40.986 --> 20:42.819
And he's younger
than we thought.

20:42.821 --> 20:44.588
Go ahead, Kate.

20:44.590 --> 20:45.889
We reviewed
the M.E. reports

20:45.891 --> 20:47.924
and confirmed that the unsub
externalizes rage,

20:47.926 --> 20:49.259
specifically towards
the two fathers.

20:49.261 --> 20:52.162
There was an escalation
on the last victim, Mr. Isaacs.

20:52.164 --> 20:54.164
Water torture
and whipping marks,

20:54.166 --> 20:55.632
likely from the same belt
used to kill him.

20:55.634 --> 20:57.401
Sounds like he's
getting revenge.

20:57.403 --> 20:58.969
Given his youth
and the anger,

20:58.971 --> 21:01.905
he's not trying to fill the father role
like we initially thought.

21:01.907 --> 21:04.541
He's inserting himself
as the firstborn child

21:04.543 --> 21:07.044
who has the most rage
at his father.

21:20.158 --> 21:23.593
Man: Hey! don't just
stand there, reel it in!

21:23.595 --> 21:26.263
You're doing it wrong.

22:01.866 --> 22:03.233
Hotch: We believe we're
looking for a white male

22:03.235 --> 22:04.668
in his early to mid-20s.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.604
But how does one guy
control and kill entire families?

22:07.606 --> 22:08.939
Do you think he's got
an accomplice?

22:08.941 --> 22:10.707
We ruled that out in Aruba.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.542
His obsessions are
too personal to share.

22:12.544 --> 22:15.512
It's his intense preparation
that gives him the upper hand.

22:15.514 --> 22:17.080
Given his age
and his aggression,

22:17.082 --> 22:18.815
he's an internal annihilator.

22:18.817 --> 22:21.685
His victims are surrogates
for his own dysfunctional family.

22:21.687 --> 22:25.255
Once he gets them alone, he isolates
the greatest physical threat, the father.

22:25.257 --> 22:26.523
This makes him feel superior.

22:26.525 --> 22:28.358
And he thrives
on that power.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.860
It gives him the
confidence he needs

22:29.862 --> 22:31.061
to charm them
and harm them.

22:31.063 --> 22:32.763
Fitz: Sounds like a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

22:32.765 --> 22:34.664
Jack: Something like that.

22:34.666 --> 22:36.933
And what we've learned about unsubs
on foreign soil is they're adaptable,

22:36.935 --> 22:38.835
both socially and culturally.

22:38.837 --> 22:42.038
It's the level of intelligence that often
makes them more dangerous.

22:42.040 --> 22:44.708
Lily: The fathers
are the last to die,

22:44.710 --> 22:47.344
forced to watch each family
member be killed.

22:47.346 --> 22:50.647
His abuse or neglect
made him feel angry and alone.

22:50.649 --> 22:52.916
The damage was done
long ago

22:52.918 --> 22:54.050
and imprinted on him.

22:54.052 --> 22:56.119
Hotch: And he won't
back away from this.

22:56.121 --> 22:58.121
He's driven to kill
these families.

22:58.123 --> 23:01.591
Fitz, we need the locals
back out there.

23:01.593 --> 23:03.427
Someone has seen this man.

23:10.001 --> 23:13.069
Blow it out.

23:17.775 --> 23:19.810
Blow it out.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.112
Daddy, please.

23:22.114 --> 23:24.514
Blow it out!

23:25.349 --> 23:28.084
Do it!

23:34.225 --> 23:35.826
There you go.

23:37.395 --> 23:39.763
There you go.

23:43.635 --> 23:45.168
Shh.

23:48.106 --> 23:49.072
Shh.

23:49.074 --> 23:53.310
Stop crying!
You ruin everything!

23:54.178 --> 23:56.646
I told you to shut up!

23:56.648 --> 23:58.982
Shut up!

23:58.984 --> 24:00.417
Shut up!

24:00.419 --> 24:02.319
Shut up!

24:06.725 --> 24:07.725
Don't touch her!

24:07.726 --> 24:10.026
What are you
gonna do about it?

24:10.862 --> 24:13.096
Hmm?!

24:13.098 --> 24:15.699
Nothing!

24:15.701 --> 24:17.167
Sit down!

24:30.715 --> 24:33.550
Clear the table!

24:38.656 --> 24:41.224
Listen to me.

24:41.226 --> 24:44.160
I've counted 6 families that he passed
up because they weren't his ideal.

24:44.162 --> 24:46.396
They have no clue
how close he was to them.

24:46.398 --> 24:48.064
It gives me the jeebies.

24:49.300 --> 24:50.901
Hey.

24:50.903 --> 24:52.569
You there?

24:52.571 --> 24:54.337
Uh, yeah.

24:54.339 --> 24:55.572
Check this out.

24:55.574 --> 24:57.107
Oh, you're a good egg.

24:57.109 --> 24:58.575
It keeps me motivated.

24:58.577 --> 25:00.677
My mom used to draw.

25:00.679 --> 25:02.178
Well, that makes sense.

25:02.180 --> 25:03.480
It's in the genes.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.215
Ok. What do you got
besides mad skills?

25:05.217 --> 25:08.485
Ok. These license plates
are from all over.

25:08.487 --> 25:10.820
He didn't just steal
tags from the VW bus.

25:10.822 --> 25:12.656
Each day
he's got a new one.

25:12.658 --> 25:14.324
That's a serious
forensic countermeasure.

25:14.326 --> 25:16.526
He's taking a risk
stealing all these tags.

25:16.528 --> 25:17.994
Where's he getting them from?

25:17.996 --> 25:19.462
Someplace
they won't miss them.

25:19.464 --> 25:20.597
Junkyards?

25:20.599 --> 25:22.632
Ah, see, but this one
traces back to a rental car.

25:22.634 --> 25:25.502
No one ever reported the tags stolen.
It happens all the time.

25:25.504 --> 25:27.170
Criminals target people
who won't report crimes.

25:27.172 --> 25:28.638
They figure
you're on vacation,

25:28.640 --> 25:30.307
you don't want to be inconvenienced
with a police report.

25:30.309 --> 25:32.175
No one ever thinks
something this small could be a clue

25:32.177 --> 25:33.510
to a bigger crime,
but it is,

25:33.512 --> 25:34.844
and that's how
our trails run cold.

25:34.846 --> 25:36.346
Then we have think
like he does,

25:36.348 --> 25:39.149
find easy targets
for plenty of tags.

25:39.151 --> 25:40.183
Hit me.

25:40.185 --> 25:42.085
This is interesting.
The first kills in Aruba

25:42.087 --> 25:44.187
were less organized
and lacked the intense torture

25:44.189 --> 25:46.156
we saw in Florida
with the Isaacs.

25:46.158 --> 25:48.992
Well, maybe it's because he had a year
in between kills to perfect his game.

25:48.994 --> 25:50.694
It could be, but what if
it's more than that?

25:50.696 --> 25:53.630
What if his rage in Florida
was some kind of statement?

25:53.632 --> 25:54.898
Like what?

25:54.900 --> 25:56.733
I'm gonna punish the Americans
on American soil.

25:56.735 --> 25:59.235
So something bad happened
to him in Florida.

25:59.237 --> 26:01.004
And I think it must have
involved water.

26:01.006 --> 26:02.672
Why would you say that?

26:02.674 --> 26:04.507
All the fathers showed signs
of near drowning,

26:04.509 --> 26:06.276
but we never figured out why.

26:43.614 --> 26:46.650
I double-checked the salinity levels
in the fathers' lungs.

26:46.652 --> 26:48.218
In Aruba it was freshwater,

26:48.220 --> 26:49.853
but in Mr. Isaacs' case,

26:49.855 --> 26:52.255
it was a combination
of fresh and saltwater.

26:52.257 --> 26:53.857
Well, the Everglades
are fresh,

26:53.859 --> 26:56.259
the Gulf and Atlantic
are salt.

26:56.261 --> 26:57.761
Where do they meet?

26:57.763 --> 27:00.096
At the Florida Bay,
but that's the bottom of the state.

27:00.098 --> 27:03.466
That would have been a 5-hour car ride
from the abduction site.

27:03.468 --> 27:05.969
Well, the Isaacs were found an hour
outside of Orlando,

27:05.971 --> 27:08.338
so, what did he do, abduct
them from the airport,

27:08.340 --> 27:09.806
drive south to torture them,

27:09.808 --> 27:11.574
then drive another 5 hours
to the dump site?

27:11.576 --> 27:14.244
I know this guy is cocky, but he
wouldn't keep them on the road that long.

27:14.246 --> 27:15.812
Agreed. Way too risky.

27:15.814 --> 27:17.280
So what if he didn't
take the risk?

27:17.282 --> 27:18.848
What are you
thinking?

27:18.850 --> 27:20.850
He abducted them in Orlando.
He could drive them to the coast.

27:20.852 --> 27:23.319
That's only an hour away.

27:23.321 --> 27:25.021
Then he gets them to
one of these beach towns,

27:25.023 --> 27:27.457
say, Cocoa, Daytona,
Melbourne,

27:27.459 --> 27:29.826
transfers them to the
secluded, controlled environment

27:29.828 --> 27:31.961
we know he needs
for the torture.

27:31.963 --> 27:34.764
But the journey south
and then north would take 24 hours.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.068
He's got them on a boat.

27:50.948 --> 27:52.682
Sit down.

28:10.735 --> 28:12.102
Uhh!

28:14.238 --> 28:15.672
Get his gun! Run!

28:21.979 --> 28:24.114
Run!

28:25.583 --> 28:27.317
Run! Run!

28:27.319 --> 28:29.419
Hurry! Go, go, go!

29:00.568 --> 29:02.136
Yeah, hey.

29:02.138 --> 29:04.371
I need some Intel
on marinas around here.

29:04.373 --> 29:05.739
He has contacts
everywhere.

29:05.741 --> 29:06.741
Yeah.

29:06.742 --> 29:08.409
It's that military
brotherhood.

29:08.411 --> 29:09.710
There's nothing
else like it.

29:09.712 --> 29:11.011
Well, that's gotta
come in handy.

29:11.013 --> 29:13.013
The boat would have launched
from somewhere isolated.

29:13.015 --> 29:15.849
We can narrow this down
by looking at the boats

29:15.851 --> 29:17.584
12 to 24 miles from shore.

29:17.586 --> 29:19.219
Wouldn't he go farther out?

29:19.221 --> 29:21.922
He doesn't need to.
Barbados has no jurisdiction

29:21.924 --> 29:23.557
once he's in
international waters.

29:23.559 --> 29:27.027
Then he'll never be charged for his crimes.
That can't be legal.

29:27.029 --> 29:29.897
The law of the ship is the law
of the country whose flag he's flying.

29:29.899 --> 29:31.899
My guess is he's done
his research

29:31.901 --> 29:35.636
and registered to a country that doesn't
have the resources to prosecute.

29:35.638 --> 29:38.372
We're tracking all vessels
large enough to hold 4 people captive.

29:38.374 --> 29:40.808
He doesn't risk a long drive,
so we're looking for marinas

29:40.810 --> 29:42.076
closest to the airport.

29:42.078 --> 29:44.845
Problem is, there's a dock
in every direction.

29:44.847 --> 29:46.747
Ok, my contact says there's
an industrial marina

29:46.749 --> 29:48.215
about a half an hour
from the airport.

29:48.217 --> 29:50.384
It's isolated. It probably would have
been quiet last night.

29:50.386 --> 29:52.386
We'll come with you.
Go check it out.

29:52.388 --> 29:55.456
I got water and air reinforcements
waiting on your call.

29:55.458 --> 29:57.791
We can't do a blind search.
If he knows we're onto him,

29:57.793 --> 29:59.960
he'll kill the Sullivans.

30:08.636 --> 30:11.071
This is your fault.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.410
Your fault!

30:22.784 --> 30:25.119
Yeah, this is definitely it.

30:25.121 --> 30:27.421
Same license plate.

30:33.461 --> 30:36.163
Looks like he used Rohypnol,
like you said.

30:36.165 --> 30:38.098
Colorless, odorless, tasteless.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.933
That makes them easier
to control.

30:39.935 --> 30:42.736
There's not a lot of foot traffic out here,
even during the day.

30:42.738 --> 30:45.472
We could try a canvass, but my guess
is he was probably too quick

30:45.474 --> 30:46.774
to be spotted.

30:46.776 --> 30:49.176
And he left his keys
in the cup holder.

30:49.178 --> 30:50.177
So what do you want to bet...

30:52.915 --> 30:54.648
Tank's almost full.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.316
30 miles from
the airport to here.

30:56.318 --> 30:59.353
He filled up the night
he took the Sullivans.

31:00.856 --> 31:01.856
Garcia: Hey.

31:01.857 --> 31:02.890
Hey, baby girl.

31:02.892 --> 31:04.391
Hey, handsome. I was
just about to call you.

31:04.393 --> 31:06.426
Well, ladies first.
And a gent, don't forget.

31:06.428 --> 31:07.461
Oh, that's right.
My bad.

31:07.463 --> 31:08.862
How you doin', Monty?
Hey, Morgan.

31:08.864 --> 31:10.831
So Monty, wonder person,
found about a dozen license plates

31:10.833 --> 31:12.599
that scumbag
had put on the van.

31:12.601 --> 31:14.067
He stole a few off of rental cars
and took the rest

31:14.069 --> 31:16.003
off of old cars at a repair shop
near the airport.

31:16.005 --> 31:17.337
Was there a gas station?

31:17.339 --> 31:18.305
Indeed.

31:18.307 --> 31:19.807
Security footage?
You know it.

31:19.809 --> 31:22.176
Garcia: We're sending it
to your phones now.

31:24.112 --> 31:26.747
There he is.

31:26.749 --> 31:28.448
Didn't see the camera,
did you?

31:28.450 --> 31:30.050
Or he's just a cocky
son of a bitch.

31:30.052 --> 31:33.420
Hey, Monty, can you run this guy's
mug through facial recognition?

31:33.422 --> 31:36.123
It's going now, but they're
processing 8 million images.

31:36.125 --> 31:37.958
Even with the bonded T-1
it could take a while.

31:37.960 --> 31:39.626
We don't have a while.

31:39.628 --> 31:42.863
We're hitting a dead end
with unsolved cases involving water.

31:42.865 --> 31:45.566
I've been thinking
we should look at solved cases.

31:45.568 --> 31:49.102
This unsub isn't old enough to be
a hardened criminal.

31:49.104 --> 31:51.038
But his countermeasures
and his confidence

31:51.040 --> 31:52.773
feel like he's had
a lot of practice.

31:52.775 --> 31:54.341
So what if he were
a budding psychopath?

31:54.343 --> 31:56.143
We should check homicides
going back to his teens.

31:56.145 --> 31:58.645
Lily, cross with juvenile
custody worldwide.

31:58.647 --> 32:02.316
And check which countries
have blue and orange in their flags.

32:02.318 --> 32:05.018
Or sports teams. There's a reason
he chose those colors.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.553
We just haven't
found it yet.

32:06.555 --> 32:07.955
You don't think
he's American?

32:07.957 --> 32:09.523
He has some sort of
connection to the states.

32:09.525 --> 32:11.925
That's why he's attacking
American families.

32:11.927 --> 32:13.527
Now that we feel that he may have
committed murder,

32:13.529 --> 32:15.963
it's doubtful that state
would grant him a passport.

32:15.965 --> 32:17.264
What country would?
Plenty.

32:17.266 --> 32:18.866
Wait, but if he was guilty
of something horrific before,

32:18.868 --> 32:20.534
wouldn't he still
be locked up?

32:20.536 --> 32:22.035
Not necessarily.

32:22.037 --> 32:24.371
Remember when Natalee Holloway
disappeared?

32:24.373 --> 32:25.839
It'll be 10 years ago
in May.

32:25.841 --> 32:28.842
The prime suspect was never
put away despite our profile.

32:28.844 --> 32:32.107
He was free.
And 5 years later to the day,

32:32.108 --> 32:34.808
he abducted and killed
another young woman in Peru.

32:34.810 --> 32:36.009
Reid: Van der Sloot
went dormant,

32:36.011 --> 32:37.711
but his underlying homicidal
behavior grew stronger.

32:37.713 --> 32:39.379
That definitely
could have happened here.

32:39.381 --> 32:42.750
Kate: That means the Everetts
in Aruba reignited his devious fantasies.

32:42.752 --> 32:44.785
So if they weren't his first
victims, who were?

32:44.787 --> 32:45.886
His own family.

32:45.888 --> 32:48.555
Narrow it down to sons
who killed their fathers.

32:48.557 --> 32:49.690
That's it.

32:49.692 --> 32:50.758
What?

32:50.760 --> 32:53.360
Look at this.

32:53.362 --> 32:56.263
The only sign of outward
frustration.

32:56.265 --> 32:59.032
He nearly gets hit
by a car. Right here.

32:59.034 --> 33:01.502
Instead of yelling
at the driver, he holds it in.

33:01.504 --> 33:03.203
Then he has
a passive-aggressive moment.

33:03.205 --> 33:06.673
He taps the center
of his head like this.

33:06.675 --> 33:11.745
That's a gesture, and it means stupid
or crazy in Dutch culture.

33:11.747 --> 33:15.949
Oranje. The Netherlands
soccer team.

33:15.951 --> 33:18.185
That's why he's wearing
a blue and orange hat.

33:18.187 --> 33:20.287
He's not American.
Lily.

33:20.289 --> 33:21.588
Already on it.

33:59.828 --> 34:02.396
It's ok.

34:11.139 --> 34:12.873
Don't touch him!

34:16.010 --> 34:18.011
Get away from him.

34:34.262 --> 34:36.263
This is it.
The Tidwell family

34:36.264 --> 34:40.033
was massacred in their hotel
room while on holiday in 2004.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.869
Physical and behavioral
evidence

34:41.871 --> 34:43.971
pointed to the troubled
15-year-old son Jerry.

34:43.973 --> 34:45.772
He was declared
temporarily insane

34:45.774 --> 34:47.940
and hospitalized
until he was 21.

34:47.943 --> 34:51.011
If Tidwell's the unsub, is there a connection
to the month of April?

34:51.013 --> 34:54.047
April 9 was his father's
birthday.

34:54.049 --> 34:55.782
The core of his rage.

34:55.784 --> 34:58.719
His father videotaped his abuse, and his
American stepmother

34:58.721 --> 35:00.187
and half-siblings were spared.

35:00.189 --> 35:02.422
That's why he's
attacking Americans

35:02.424 --> 35:04.358
and punishing
the whole family.

35:05.728 --> 35:06.860
Go ahead, Garcia.

35:06.862 --> 35:09.663
Got a match.
Jerry Tidwell was released,

35:09.665 --> 35:11.164
went to go live in Aruba
with his uncle

35:11.166 --> 35:12.499
who has a fishing charter
business.

35:12.501 --> 35:14.134
Now, the uncle died
two years ago.

35:14.136 --> 35:16.670
Tidwell inherited the business and
has been on the move every since.

35:16.672 --> 35:18.038
Jack: Send us the specs
for the boat.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.306
Done and done.

35:19.308 --> 35:21.775
He probably disabled
the automated identification system,

35:21.777 --> 35:24.811
so we're forced
to track the vessel by size.

35:24.813 --> 35:27.314
Let's see how many 75-foot
boats are offshore.

35:27.316 --> 35:29.483
We need live satellite
images.

35:29.485 --> 35:31.518
Already done.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.722
White and black boat
isolated from the others.

35:37.158 --> 35:39.793
There it is.
Can you monitor from here?

35:39.795 --> 35:41.028
You got it.

35:41.030 --> 35:43.096
Fitz, we need heat
signatures for 5 bodies.

35:43.098 --> 35:45.232
Choppers are standing by.

35:47.303 --> 35:48.735
Aah!

35:59.347 --> 36:00.547
Come here.
No, no!

36:00.549 --> 36:02.149
Get over here!

36:02.151 --> 36:04.117
No!
No! No!

36:04.119 --> 36:05.185
Let him go!

36:05.187 --> 36:07.421
Come here!

36:08.690 --> 36:10.824
No! No!

36:10.826 --> 36:11.892
No! No!

36:11.894 --> 36:12.993
Let him go!

36:12.995 --> 36:14.728
Let him go!
No! No!

36:16.598 --> 36:20.200
No! No!

36:20.202 --> 36:22.035
No!
No!

36:22.037 --> 36:25.105
Nick!
Nick!

36:48.012 --> 36:49.846
Shut up!

36:51.650 --> 36:52.682
Stop crying!

36:52.684 --> 36:53.684
Aah!

36:53.685 --> 36:54.685
Stop it.

36:54.686 --> 36:55.652
No!

36:55.654 --> 36:56.686
Stop it!
No!

36:56.688 --> 36:58.354
Get your hands off her!

37:02.227 --> 37:03.493
Stop it right now.

37:03.495 --> 37:05.995
Leave her alone!

37:10.634 --> 37:11.634
Run!

37:11.636 --> 37:13.069
Run, Alison! Run!

37:13.071 --> 37:16.206
Run!

37:31.989 --> 37:33.323
Aah!

37:39.463 --> 37:41.231
Olly olly oxen free!

37:53.211 --> 37:55.578
Please...Please...

38:02.019 --> 38:03.653
Aah!

38:03.655 --> 38:05.054
Aah!

38:05.056 --> 38:06.756
Uhh!

38:06.758 --> 38:09.292
Boy: I'm sorry!
I'll be good!

38:09.294 --> 38:10.760
Man: Come here, boy!

38:10.762 --> 38:12.996
Please, Daddy, stop!

38:21.071 --> 38:22.805
I'll give you something
to cry about!

38:22.807 --> 38:23.807
Move!

38:23.808 --> 38:25.942
Move! Get up!

38:27.978 --> 38:30.280
Do you want to run next?
Huh? Do you want to run next?

38:30.282 --> 38:32.615
Morgan: Tidwell! FBI!

38:32.617 --> 38:34.017
Daddy, help me, please!

38:34.019 --> 38:37.120
Just stop!
This is your fault!

38:37.122 --> 38:38.188
Drop the weapon!

38:38.190 --> 38:39.190
Shut up!

38:39.191 --> 38:41.691
Alison, look at me,
all right?

38:41.693 --> 38:44.394
Eyes over here.
Focus on me. That's it.

38:44.396 --> 38:47.230
Jack: Let the girl go!
You don't have to do this!

38:47.232 --> 38:50.133
You don't know what he did!
You don't know!

38:50.135 --> 38:52.969
I don't, but you don't
have to die today. Drop the gun!

38:52.971 --> 38:53.937
Shut up!

38:53.939 --> 38:57.207
Alison! Eyes over here!
Look at me!

38:57.209 --> 38:58.374
Let the girl go!

38:58.376 --> 39:01.211
I told you to shut up!

39:01.213 --> 39:03.546
Alison, drop!

39:04.782 --> 39:06.916
Mommy!

39:06.918 --> 39:09.219
Our son is overboard!

39:09.221 --> 39:11.988
Our son! He threw
our son overboard!

39:11.990 --> 39:17.093
The son is overboard!
I repeat, the son is overboard!

39:17.095 --> 39:19.762
We need open water
search and rescue now!

39:19.764 --> 39:20.764
Copy.

39:20.765 --> 39:22.098
Open sea rescue.

39:27.404 --> 39:29.505
Come on! Come on!

39:45.756 --> 39:47.624
Lily: We got something.

40:15.986 --> 40:16.986
Nick!

40:16.988 --> 40:18.655
Oh, Nick!

40:18.657 --> 40:20.390
Greg: Nick! Oh!

40:22.893 --> 40:25.728
I love you so much.

40:25.730 --> 40:29.799
Oh, my god. Ohh...

40:51.221 --> 40:53.556
I mean, talk about
a total surprise.

40:53.558 --> 40:56.459
I'm not just a dad,
I'm a granddad.

40:56.461 --> 40:58.494
Well, congratulations.
That's fantastic.

40:58.496 --> 41:00.663
So, how's Karen.

41:00.665 --> 41:02.632
She's great.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.734
You know, I gotta tell you,
it's admirable

41:04.736 --> 41:07.236
that you two
have made it work.

41:07.238 --> 41:08.438
What's your secret?

41:08.440 --> 41:11.174
Uh, simple, really.

41:11.176 --> 41:14.510
I know I'm a better person
with her beside me.

41:14.512 --> 41:17.814
And she knows that I won't
stop doing everything I can

41:17.816 --> 41:19.649
to make the world
a safer place

41:19.651 --> 41:21.818
for our kids
to grow up in.

41:21.820 --> 41:22.919
And how are the kids?

41:22.921 --> 41:25.288
Ryan just got into
the Academy.

41:25.290 --> 41:27.557
No kidding.

41:29.493 --> 41:30.526
Yeah.

41:30.528 --> 41:32.829
It's just
all I ever wanted

41:32.831 --> 41:35.832
is to protect my children
from all we've seen,

41:35.834 --> 41:39.602
and now Ryan will be
right in the line of fire.

41:39.604 --> 41:42.238
Well, he's learned
from the best.

41:43.841 --> 41:45.174
How are the Sullivans?

41:45.176 --> 41:46.743
They're better.

41:46.745 --> 41:49.846
So, how many of these
do you think we've solved?

41:49.848 --> 41:52.815
Mm, enough for
another best-seller.

41:52.817 --> 41:55.017
These are the endings
we want.

41:55.019 --> 41:56.519
Amen to that.

41:58.957 --> 42:00.223
Cheers.
