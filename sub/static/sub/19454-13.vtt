<i> Absolutely.</i>
<i> Do you look like a fucking</i>

<i> Oh, fuck, yes.</i>

05:24.992 --> 05:30.429
<i>Uh-oh, ooh, fuck.</i>
<i> Adore Delano's favorite</i>

06:04.198 --> 06:05.764
<i>my dad is from Honduras, which</i>

06:05.766 --> 06:07.099
<i>basically means I have a large</i>

06:07.101 --> 06:08.433
<i>dick, no credit, and a tendency</i>

06:08.435 --> 06:09.368
<i>to take things that don't belong</i>

<i>to me.</i>

06:10.037 --> 06:13.939
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> I would never want to sit</i>

10:12.946 --> 10:13.945
<i> How is she, though?</i>

10:13.947 --> 10:15.347
<i> What?</i>

10:15.349 --> 10:17.182
<i> The top five smackdowns.</i>

[Laughs]

10:31.698 --> 10:39.471
[Laughs]
Welcome back to <i>RuPaul's drag</i>
<i>race</i> countdown to the crown.

10:39.473 --> 10:45.243
This season's queens came
dressed to thrill from the
bottom of their cha-cha heels to

10:45.245 --> 10:52.550
the top of their second heads.
Oh!
The top four drag-cessories.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.619
Number four.

10:54.621 --> 11:03.294
Gia Gunn's giant purse is

11:03.296 --> 11:05.230
like a petite clutch for a drag

11:05.232 --> 11:07.632
queen, because it do take

11:07.634 --> 11:09.701
a lot to look like this.

11:09.703 --> 11:10.835
I got a little brush.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.970
Is this your baby?

11:11.972 --> 11:13.338
I got a little tilapia

11:13.340 --> 11:14.472
in here.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.340
You know what would have made

11:15.342 --> 11:16.007
it better?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.243
Is if the purse rolled in

11:18.245 --> 11:19.878
and then stopped, and then

11:19.880 --> 11:21.179
she got out of it and then

11:21.181 --> 11:22.480
picked it up and walked out,

11:22.482 --> 11:24.115
'cause it was big enough.

11:24.117 --> 11:31.222
Come on, now, it is a known
fact that a woman do carry an
evening bag at a dinner party.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.290
Number three.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.159
Oh, that was beautiful, ooh,

11:34.161 --> 11:35.326
the yellow in the umbrella

11:35.328 --> 11:36.928
and the blue, that was gorgeous.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.063
She looked stunning.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.197
If you can just walk around

11:39.199 --> 11:40.365
with your own, like, special

11:40.367 --> 11:41.466
effects, and just have rain

11:41.468 --> 11:42.734
falling on you, like,

11:42.736 --> 11:43.601
it's great.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.971
This runway look was
a little misleading though,
because I thought her name

11:46.973 --> 11:51.876
should have been April showers.
Make it rain, girl.
Make it rain.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.011
Number two.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.446
Courtney's character in the

11:54.448 --> 11:56.414
Ru-sical got addicted to

11:56.416 --> 11:57.649
fish oil.

11:57.651 --> 12:01.152
I didn't know it was so
addictive.
I would have never started.

12:01.154 --> 12:05.623
All your wishes will grow
if you take a swig
of this

12:05.625 --> 12:08.393
fish oil
drink for me.
Don't do it.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.029
Don't do it!
Don't do it!

12:11.031 --> 12:13.765
Number one.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.133
I think it's very important

12:15.135 --> 12:16.735
for a queen to have good head on

12:16.737 --> 12:17.836
her shoulders.

12:17.838 --> 12:21.339
Do you have a name for the
head on top of your head?
Ornacia.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.341
Ornacia, okay.

12:23.343 --> 12:27.212
I really expected a lot from
ornacia.
I'm shocked she didn't make it

12:27.214 --> 12:31.783
into the final three.
Ooh, boy.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.718
Ornacia mean mugs the camera.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.488
Are you okay?
Uh-huh.

12:36.490 --> 12:37.322
Back in New York City, I used

12:37.324 --> 12:38.323
to go clubbing with ornacia all

12:38.325 --> 12:38.990
the time.

12:38.992 --> 12:42.560
We're on the list, ornacia plus
one.
I love this song, ornacia,

12:42.562 --> 12:46.364
don't you?
Oh, my God, this d.J.
Is really great.

12:46.366 --> 12:51.302
You know, some parts of the
show really made me wet...
In the eye.

12:51.304 --> 12:56.608
Get your mind out of the gutter,
pervert.
The top five moments that made

12:56.610 --> 12:59.978
number five.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.045
Thank you.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.547
Milk got really choked up

13:02.549 --> 13:03.448
when she left.

13:03.450 --> 13:10.789
I just want to thank you
so much for allowing me to be
who I am without fear of being

13:10.791 --> 13:16.594
ridiculed.
Milk gets eliminated,
and it's such a shame.

13:16.596 --> 13:20.365
The one time she looks like
a woman, and she gets sent home.
What the hell?

13:20.367 --> 13:25.203
If you love yourself and are

13:25.205 --> 13:27.205
happy with what you're

13:27.207 --> 13:29.741
contributing to the world, then

13:29.743 --> 13:33.478
no one can fault you for that.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.479
I had to cut Milk out of my

13:34.481 --> 13:36.214
diet, and I wasn't ready.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.615
I'm not ready for soy.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.084
It doesn't taste the same.

13:40.086 --> 13:42.654
Can I get my phone back?

13:42.656 --> 13:43.955
Number four.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.357
Every time we go on <i>untucked,</i>

13:46.359 --> 13:47.859
<i>one minute they reading hos,</i>

13:47.861 --> 13:49.093
<i>and the next one they boo-hooing</i>

13:49.095 --> 13:50.128
<i>into their glasses.</i>

13:50.130 --> 13:55.133
<i>I can't take it.</i>
<i> You got everything from mama.</i>
<i>We're cut from the same cloth.</i>

13:55.135 --> 13:58.436
<i>You got the boobies.</i>
<i>Well, mama ain't got a butt,</i>
<i>but you do.</i>

13:58.438 --> 14:02.774
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i>And get ghetto if you have to</i>
<i>with these girls, okay?</i>

14:02.776 --> 14:07.679
<i>See you when you get home</i>
<i>with that money.</i>
<i> My mom's a</i> <i>chola,</i> and she

14:07.681 --> 14:10.849
likes big cock, okay!
[Laughs]

14:10.851 --> 14:11.749
Number three.

14:11.751 --> 14:13.251
I feel very attacked.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.153
Relax, relax.

14:15.155 --> 14:21.559
After the stand-up,
Laganja broke down again.
I've given up everything in

14:21.561 --> 14:25.663
my life to be a drag queen.
When I'm--
breathe, breathe.

14:25.665 --> 14:26.898
If you are gonna cry that

14:26.900 --> 14:28.333
fucking much, get a better damn

14:28.335 --> 14:29.167
lash adhesive

14:29.169 --> 14:31.369
and waterproof fucking mascara.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.872
The five "g"s--

14:33.874 --> 14:36.908
good God, ganja, get a grip.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.345
This is just too fucking
much.
You broke me down.

14:40.347 --> 14:45.783
I feel like shit,
and I look stupid.
God, this fucking sucks.

14:45.785 --> 14:50.588
I can't believe it took all
the time to episode eight for
people to tell Laganja that her

14:50.590 --> 14:56.060
voice was annoying.
Come on!
Okay?

14:56.062 --> 15:00.031
That's not fair.
I'm sorry, we all have different
voices, you know?

15:00.033 --> 15:03.568
I've been told my whole life my
voice was annoying, and, you
know, now, it's how I make

15:03.570 --> 15:06.037
my moneys.
Work, bitch.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.405
Number two.

15:07.407 --> 15:10.041
I am HIV positive.

15:10.043 --> 15:16.915
I wanted to come on this show,
and I wanted to be that voice
for people who are scared

15:16.917 --> 15:21.920
to speak out about that.
Trinity admitted that she has
HIV, which I think is

15:21.922 --> 15:27.058
extremely brave.
I miss you, and I love you.
You told me when you were

15:27.060 --> 15:31.796
little, "I'm gonna be a star.
I'm gonna be on TV,"
so here we are.

15:31.798 --> 15:35.867
The fact that Trinity k.
Bonet's mother sent that
beautiful message and the fact

15:35.869 --> 15:41.572
that she just seemed, like,
so team Trinity, I love that.
I think all mothers should be

15:41.574 --> 15:45.510
that open and loving to their
kids.
It was so great to see.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.879
Number one.

15:47.881 --> 15:50.248
Here comes the bride.

15:50.250 --> 15:51.516
[Fake crying]

15:51.518 --> 15:52.917
[Fake sobbing]

15:52.919 --> 15:55.720
[Laughter]

15:55.722 --> 16:00.491
And some people shed
real tears.
I believe every living

16:00.493 --> 16:06.931
creature in the universe
deserves the right to love
and to be happy.

16:06.933 --> 16:11.836
And I'm finally going home to
plan my own wedding, finally.
[Sighs]

16:11.838 --> 16:14.605
That's cute.
Little miss joslyn's all
emotional, because she has to

16:14.607 --> 16:18.509
make over these wedding couples,
and she's engaged.
That's special.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.747
I know I better have an
invitation.
Guess who caught the bouquet.

16:22.749 --> 16:30.688
Thanks, bradonna.
[Laughs]
Smells rotten.

16:30.690 --> 16:35.326
A moment you didn't see this
season came during the talk show
challenge.

16:35.328 --> 16:42.300
We surprised each of the queens
with a mystery guest, and things
got a little wild.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.634
It's finally that time to

16:43.636 --> 16:44.969
reveal our special

16:44.971 --> 16:45.970
mystery guest.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.705
From the national wildlife

16:47.707 --> 16:50.074
federation--

16:50.076 --> 16:50.975
I went to continuation school.

16:50.977 --> 16:51.709
I don't know what that word

16:51.711 --> 16:53.111
means.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.012
Nature-alist

16:54.014 --> 16:58.383
David miss-a-Jews.

16:58.385 --> 17:03.254
Misajews--ahh.
Mis-ajusky.
Misajusky.

17:03.256 --> 17:07.058
Mr. Jew sky.
Hello, David.
Hi, there.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.762
Oh, my goodness.
I have an animal out here
that you've probably never seen

17:10.764 --> 17:13.064
before.
[Squeals]
It's called a binturong

17:13.066 --> 17:15.433
or bearcat.
Okay.
Have you ever seen one this

17:15.435 --> 17:18.069
big before?
I have, actually.
Oh, awesome.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.438
You see that other thing
sticking out there.
I do, but I didn't want to

17:20.440 --> 17:22.740
mention it.
I just thought she was excited
to see me.

17:22.742 --> 17:26.110
So is that her tail that's--
that is her tail, yup.
Okay, that's a look.

17:26.112 --> 17:29.280
Is she a marsupial?
She's not a marsupial.
That's a great question.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.083
You know, reflecting your
homeland there.
Good girl, raji.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.453
You look like somebody I know
called raja.
[Record scratch]

17:35.455 --> 17:37.321
Coming up, we count down the

17:37.323 --> 17:39.257
top ten turnt-up looks on the

17:39.259 --> 17:40.258
runway...

17:40.260 --> 17:42.460
Eloquent, it's a word.

17:42.462 --> 17:43.995
The top five judge mental

17:43.997 --> 17:44.796
moments.

17:44.798 --> 17:47.665
Put a cork in it.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.634
And the top three queens let

17:49.636 --> 17:53.204
us have it, plus the world video

17:53.206 --> 17:55.773
premiere of <i>sissy that walk</i> as

18:02.982 --> 18:10.621
[Laughs]
Welcome back to <i>RuPaul's drag</i>
<i>race</i> countdown to the crown.

18:10.623 --> 18:16.194
This season, the runway,
like my pussy, was on fire.
Want to take a look?

18:16.196 --> 18:19.230
The top ten turnt-up
runway looks.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.833
Number ten, Darienne Lake.

18:21.835 --> 18:22.767
She got the girls front and

18:22.769 --> 18:25.436
center, and she looks gorgeous.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.604
Love it.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.772
Number nine,

18:27.774 --> 18:30.842
Laganja Estranja.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.743
Laganja, lady gaga called.

18:32.745 --> 18:34.445
She wants her hat back.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.847
Number eight,

18:35.849 --> 18:37.782
Trinity K. Bonet.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.083
I always travel with

18:39.085 --> 18:40.551
a satellite dish, because you

18:40.553 --> 18:42.420
get more channels.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.288
Number seven, Ben de LA

18:44.290 --> 18:44.989
creme.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.624
Now, I'm not biased, but Ben

18:46.626 --> 18:52.997
de LA creme is the most gorgeous
girl to ever pounce that runway.
It's like looking in a mirror,

18:52.999 --> 18:56.134
a funhouse mirror--
you know, one that makes me
look thin.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.903
Number six, Bianca Del Rio.

18:58.905 --> 18:59.804
Who puts a streak in their

18:59.806 --> 19:00.471
wig?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.006
I mean, who does that?

19:02.008 --> 19:04.242
That's so three seasons ago.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.845
Number five, vi-vi-Vivacious.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.780
Vivacious' spike outfit

19:09.782 --> 19:12.750
looked like a microscopic image

19:12.752 --> 19:14.585
of a syphilis spore.

19:14.587 --> 19:17.388
Number four, Joslyn Fox.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.290
I think joslyn's ass is her

19:19.292 --> 19:21.726
best outfit.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.227
Oh, my God, that's so shady.

19:23.229 --> 19:25.396
Number three, Adore in

19:25.398 --> 19:27.498
diamonds.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.799
It looks like Tonya Harding

19:28.801 --> 19:30.034
is going to chase after her with

19:30.036 --> 19:32.370
a crowbar any minute.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.305
Number two, Milk.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.973
Milk came out on the runway

19:35.975 --> 19:37.008
dressed as motherfucking

19:37.010 --> 19:38.843
Pinocchio, bitch.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.378
Now, that's how you do it.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.747
Number one, Courtney Act.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.415
Courtney Act as a bird--

19:44.417 --> 19:45.783
yes, bitch.

19:45.785 --> 19:50.688
I thought that Courtney was
actually going to take flight
off the stage and take Michelle

19:50.690 --> 19:56.861
visage's lace front with her.
That's it?
That's--that's everything?

19:56.863 --> 20:01.666
You've looked at the editing
floor, and that's all you have
for me?

20:01.668 --> 20:03.701
We can't forget Ru's top 12

20:03.703 --> 20:05.536
turnt-out looks, huntys.

20:05.538 --> 20:09.207
[Upbeat pop music]

20:09.209 --> 20:09.874
Cover girl

20:09.876 --> 20:11.108
miss Ru wore every look

20:11.110 --> 20:12.476
possible this season, and they

20:12.478 --> 20:15.413
were all turnt-out.

20:15.415 --> 20:21.052
Ru's outfits are annoying,
because they're all fucking
beautiful, and I hate her.

20:21.054 --> 20:25.089
That's sweet.
I love you.
The top five judge mental

20:25.091 --> 20:28.426
moments.
The judges got into it
this season, honey.

20:28.428 --> 20:31.095
Number five.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.563
I can see Adam lambert

20:32.565 --> 20:34.332
watching these thighs.

20:34.334 --> 20:35.866
He wants some chicken leg.

20:35.868 --> 20:36.934
I know it.

20:36.936 --> 20:43.741
Adam and April carrion
sitting in a tree,
doing something we can't see.

20:43.743 --> 20:46.477
You are gorgeous.
You're gorgeous as well.
Oh, thank you.

20:46.479 --> 20:49.313
[Laughs]
Get a room.
But you can hear it, and

20:49.315 --> 20:55.019
it probably sounds like this.
[Makes suckling noise]
Ah.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.887
Number four, the o.G.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.190
Dream girl, sheryl Lee Ralph.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.791
Love the original dream girl.

21:00.793 --> 21:05.429
Come on, it doesn't get better
than that, and she don't mind
telling it like it is, either.

21:05.431 --> 21:09.500
It's like you have a beard
on your forehead.
Ain't nobody got time for that.

21:09.502 --> 21:14.705
Put a cork in it.
Put a cork in it.
I was like...

21:14.707 --> 21:19.477
Literally, speak with that
cork in the mouth.
It will do wonders for

21:19.479 --> 21:25.016
enunciation.
It helps you enunciate your
words, and people can understand

21:25.018 --> 21:29.053
number three, leah remini

21:29.055 --> 21:30.154
is here.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.255
So the lipstick should stay

21:31.257 --> 21:31.956
on.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.792
She said it lasts through
all that.
I love leah remini as

21:34.794 --> 21:39.263
a judge.
She and Michelle are just like
those two muppets who just read

21:39.265 --> 21:44.268
the show for filth.
When leah remini and Michelle
visage were getting into it,

21:44.270 --> 21:48.839
honey, I was like, "can this be
the <i>untucked</i> episode, please?"
Did it stay on through

21:48.841 --> 21:52.543
the trick or not?
Yes.
Well, I didn't get that.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.680
All right, then.
Yeah, you were on
<i>the king of queens?</i>

21:55.682 --> 21:58.115
<i> I thought they were trying to</i>

21:58.117 --> 21:59.383
<i>be too funny.</i>

21:59.385 --> 22:00.384
<i>They were trying to outdo each</i>

22:00.386 --> 22:01.819
<i>other, and that's not a team</i>

22:01.821 --> 22:02.553
<i>player.</i>

22:02.555 --> 22:04.889
<i> I'll give you that.</i>
<i>Yeah, I'll give you that.</i>
<i> Hallelujah.</i>

22:04.891 --> 22:07.758
<i> So they created a character--</i>
<i> pause.</i>
<i>One second, Ru.</i>

22:07.760 --> 22:10.227
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Michelle just said I was</i>
<i>right, so if we could just take</i>

22:10.229 --> 22:14.131
<i>a moment.</i>
<i> I'll give you that.</i>
<i> Speaking of sisterhoods, you</i>

22:14.133 --> 22:18.602
<i>have Michelle Visage and Santino</i>
<i>rice going at it like they're</i>
<i>having they own freakin'</i>

22:18.604 --> 22:22.106
<i>quarrels.</i>
<i>I--do they just not agree</i>
<i>on anything?</i>

22:22.108 --> 22:23.040
<i> Number two.</i>

22:23.042 --> 22:23.774
<i> He wants to say whatever</i>

22:23.776 --> 22:24.675
<i>i say, the opposite.</i>

22:24.677 --> 22:25.376
<i> No, I don't.</i>

22:25.378 --> 22:26.477
<i>I don't care what you say.</i>

22:26.479 --> 22:32.083
<i> I think that Michelle and</i>
<i>Santino are definitely fighting</i>
<i>a little bit more this year,</i>

22:32.085 --> 22:37.488
<i>because I've seen a 33% increase</i>
<i>in side eye.</i>

22:37.490 --> 22:39.357
<i> It was great to see Bianca</i>

22:39.359 --> 22:40.858
<i>del nero in that light.</i>

22:40.860 --> 22:42.093
<i> Or Del Rio.</i>

22:42.095 --> 22:45.963
<i> I actually thought it was</i>
<i>like watching Bianca del nero's</i>
<i>past--</i>

22:45.965 --> 22:48.299
<i> Del Rio?</i>
<i> What'd I say?</i>
<i> Del nero.</i>

22:48.301 --> 22:50.735
<i> No, Del Rio.</i>
<i> This is the second time</i>
<i>you've said--</i>

22:50.737 --> 22:53.571
<i> del nero.</i>
<i> Del nero.</i>
<i> I would never say "del nero."</i>

22:53.573 --> 22:56.674
<i> You said it two times.</i>
<i>Go to the tape.</i>
<i> Shut the fuck, no.</i>

22:56.676 --> 22:59.710
<i> You're fucking crazy if you</i>
<i>think you didn't say it.</i>
<i> I actually thought we were</i>

22:59.712 --> 23:05.049
<i>watching a tape from Bianca del</i>
<i>nero--</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

23:05.051 --> 23:08.486
<i>Now, you're nodding, you fucker.</i>
<i> Third time.</i>
<i> "I didn't say that."</i>

23:08.488 --> 23:11.655
<i> What's a del nero?</i>
<i> I don't know, but it sounds</i>
<i>delicious.</i>

23:11.657 --> 23:13.591
<i> Number one,</i> <i>Drag Race</i> super

23:13.593 --> 23:15.826
fan khloe Kardashian.

23:15.828 --> 23:21.065
Khloe Kardashian is sort of
like the honey badger of drag.
She doesn't care.

23:21.067 --> 23:25.803
Basic bitches not wanted.
I have a very big camel toe.
My puss is very large

23:25.805 --> 23:28.773
and in charge.
I'm a big girl.
I love anybody who's got a

23:28.775 --> 23:32.710
large and in charge puss.
#nofilter.
Now, during khloe

23:32.712 --> 23:38.749
Kardashian's second appearance
this season, she performed on
the main stage with raven

23:38.751 --> 23:42.753
and manila.
The sequence was supposed to
air on <i>keeping up with the</i>

23:42.755 --> 23:52.029
<i>Kardashians,</i> so this footage is
so exclusive, it got cut from
not just one, but two shows.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.798
Look at that body, my God.

23:53.800 --> 23:54.465
It's gorgeous.

23:54.467 --> 23:55.699
Which one, me?

23:55.701 --> 23:56.367
Oh.

23:56.369 --> 24:00.805
Your pads are amazing.
Yes.
I never thought I'd be

24:00.807 --> 24:04.942
lip-synching on the stage of
<i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> again.
sashay shante

24:04.944 --> 24:09.380
yeah.
do it, do it
oh

24:09.382 --> 24:16.120
all the girls say
welcome to the jungle
khloe Kardashian,

24:16.122 --> 24:20.090
shante, you stay.
Whoo!
Thank you, Ru.

24:20.092 --> 24:24.528
Raven and I lost to
khloe Kardashian.
Damn.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.630
Up next, the top five

24:26.632 --> 24:27.731
smackdowns.

24:27.733 --> 24:30.334
Yes, God, nessa.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.369
One final look at our top

24:32.371 --> 24:34.672
three queens, and why are these

24:34.674 --> 24:36.640
queens blindfolded?

24:36.642 --> 24:37.975
Bitch, get into it.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.810
Find out, as <i>RuPaul's drag</i>

24:39.812 --> 24:41.745
<i>race</i> countdown to the crown

24:41.747 --> 24:43.347
continues.

24:43.349 --> 24:45.416
[Laughs]

24:45.418 --> 24:53.090
[Laughs]
Welcome back to <i>RuPaul's drag</i>
<i>race</i> countdown to the crown.

24:53.092 --> 25:00.831
Now, here at the Drag Race,
we're one big happy family,
and like every family,

25:00.833 --> 25:06.370
well, sometimes, shit
do get real.
The top five smackdowns.

25:06.372 --> 25:08.639
Bitch, anybody that comes

25:08.641 --> 25:09.540
down the runway looking like

25:09.542 --> 25:11.175
that thinking that that's

25:11.177 --> 25:12.443
Tony awards, I want to get into

25:12.445 --> 25:14.144
your brain, so what's going on?

25:14.146 --> 25:19.884
Gia is very one-sided with
her idea of drag.
I could go off on the number of

25:19.886 --> 25:24.054
things that she needs to fix,
but I'd rather not.

25:24.056 --> 25:26.757
Gia's drag is all about being

25:26.759 --> 25:28.058
fishy, giving the illusion of

25:28.060 --> 25:31.195
a woman, and Milk's drag is kind

25:31.197 --> 25:32.162
of opposite that.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.264
I love Milk's drag.

25:33.266 --> 25:34.598
I think there's an authenticity

25:34.600 --> 25:35.299
to it.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.734
It's just his own particular

25:36.736 --> 25:37.568
thing, and I live.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.103
I completely live for Milk.

25:39.105 --> 25:43.974
Just got off the boat, you
know, a little trip from Asia.
Just landed like fresh tilapia.

25:43.976 --> 25:44.875
Why's she so proud of

25:44.877 --> 25:45.543
tilapia?

25:45.545 --> 25:47.978
It's like the cheapest fish.

25:47.980 --> 25:51.549
You guys are all still dudes.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.117
Number four.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.151
Nice to meet you, Courtney.

25:54.153 --> 25:55.052
I'm a big fan of yours.

25:55.054 --> 25:55.986
My name's Joslyn Fox.

25:55.988 --> 25:59.557
When we need a low-rent
version of Courtney, I'll let
you know.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.258
Sometimes it's great to meet

26:01.260 --> 26:02.826
your idol, and sometimes

26:02.828 --> 26:04.295
it's not.

26:04.297 --> 26:10.134
Your drag isn't as polished
as the other drag in the
competition right now.

26:10.136 --> 26:14.638
I'm not being mean.
I'm just being factual, but I
didn't mean it in any way to

26:14.640 --> 26:16.807
it was very big sister,

26:16.809 --> 26:17.508
little sister, you know?

26:17.510 --> 26:19.109
The little sister idolizing the

26:19.111 --> 26:21.078
big sister, and then she wakes

26:21.080 --> 26:23.981
up, and realizes that it's

26:23.983 --> 26:24.848
a man.

26:24.850 --> 26:28.185
[Laughs]

26:28.187 --> 26:29.620
I've got my lace front glued

26:29.622 --> 26:30.588
down.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.823
I do glance over and notice

26:32.825 --> 26:34.491
joslyn giving a little sideburn

26:34.493 --> 26:35.926
action.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.694
We'll have to get her into

26:36.696 --> 26:39.797
a nice lace front wig.

26:39.799 --> 26:40.864
Number three.

26:40.866 --> 26:43.100
You won a challenge.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.301
I won the first challenge

26:44.303 --> 26:44.969
too.

26:44.971 --> 26:45.636
Oh, you did?

26:45.638 --> 26:49.073
Oh.
I did.
I wasn't there.

26:49.075 --> 26:53.711
Yeah, it doesn't count.
Honey, I didn't have my
glasses on, so I didn't see the

26:53.713 --> 26:57.381
ultimate shade showdown coming.
Why did Darienne hate Ben
so much?

26:57.383 --> 26:59.583
Darienne, why didn't you
choose me?
It's none of your fucking

26:59.585 --> 27:03.187
business.
All: Ooh!

27:03.189 --> 27:04.588
I don't know what intimidates

27:04.590 --> 27:06.457
a girl more, the girls who are

27:06.459 --> 27:07.491
good at the things they're not

27:07.493 --> 27:08.726
good at, or the girls who are

27:08.728 --> 27:09.460
good at the things they're

27:09.462 --> 27:10.127
good at.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.796
I'm too young and pretty to
be a cougar.
[Laughs]

27:12.798 --> 27:15.766
And a lot of, you know,
cougars are delusional.

27:15.768 --> 27:17.768
Darienne does not like de LA,

27:17.770 --> 27:18.969
and you know why?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.037
It's none of your fucking

27:20.039 --> 27:21.605
business.

27:21.607 --> 27:25.376
Number two.

27:25.378 --> 27:26.110
I do feel a little bit

27:26.112 --> 27:26.844
shafted by you today.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.212
When?

27:28.214 --> 27:29.346
I don't remember the exact

27:29.348 --> 27:30.247
comment you said.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.649
What did she say, Laganja?

27:31.651 --> 27:33.384
I want to know what she said.

27:33.386 --> 27:37.688
I tried to, like, figure out,
like, what it is I thought you
said, and I think it was just,

27:37.690 --> 27:41.458
like, the fact that, you know,
I was just, like, really
emotional and distraught

27:41.460 --> 27:45.696
and already down.
But I felt like at one point,
maybe earlier, or maybe

27:45.698 --> 27:51.702
yesterday, that possibly there
was something going on between
Adore and Laganja, but I can't

27:51.704 --> 27:55.239
number one.

27:55.241 --> 27:56.840
Fuck these bitches.

27:56.842 --> 27:58.242
Are you in a whitesnake video?

27:58.244 --> 27:59.343
What are you doing over there?

27:59.345 --> 28:02.212
She mouthed off to every
single person.
She don't--it doesn't matter

28:02.214 --> 28:05.582
who you are.
I will show you versatility
when Santino wins a sewing

28:05.584 --> 28:09.386
competition and visage wears
a fucking turtleneck.
And then I love the fact that

28:09.388 --> 28:13.524
she throws the truth back in
their face.
I'm more of a Beyonce myself.

28:13.526 --> 28:16.927
At least Beyonce's dresses
hit the floor.
Now, let's get one thing

28:16.929 --> 28:21.365
straight.
Bianca's not a bitch,
she's right.

28:21.367 --> 28:25.903
We're drag queens in a
fucking competition.
The only thing worse is fucking

28:25.905 --> 28:32.476
prison.
Now, like true sisters, my
girls are always there to lift

28:32.478 --> 28:39.016
each other up.
Let's count down this season's
top three support ho's.

28:39.018 --> 28:40.250
Number three.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.585
When everybody was bagging on

28:41.587 --> 28:44.621
the only one to stick up for

28:44.623 --> 28:45.289
her.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.358
You're ignorant.
I'm sorry, it's ignorance.
Oh, ignorant now.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.696
Okay, well, ignorant would be me
not wanting to better educate
myself.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.999
Well, educate yourself.
That's why I'm asking her
what she thinks.

28:56.001 --> 29:00.137
No, you're reading her.
Of course, when a person's
ignorant, they don't understand

29:00.139 --> 29:04.908
what that word means.
[Chuckles]
So she got all bent out of

29:04.910 --> 29:10.547
shape, and it was the truth.
I'm not educated?
You look like a fucking

29:10.549 --> 29:13.450
recycling bin.
You're welcome.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.284
Number two.

29:14.286 --> 29:15.586
You are Ben de LA creme, and

29:15.588 --> 29:16.420
that's the character that you

29:16.422 --> 29:17.321
have built, and don't you change

29:17.323 --> 29:18.055
it for nobody.

29:18.057 --> 29:23.360
When her sisters were feeling
down after a rough day at the
office, it was nice to see that

29:23.362 --> 29:26.797
Trinity was able to go around
and give them a little pep talk,
you know?

29:26.799 --> 29:33.036
Do not beat yourself up or
feel bad because Courtney, your
competitor, told you that your

29:33.038 --> 29:36.173
look is not polished.
She was giving them a pep
talk like she was a coach in the

29:36.175 --> 29:40.644
super bowl or something.
Exactly.
Didn't Beyonce perform at

29:40.646 --> 29:44.915
the super bowl?
She wasn't the coach, right?
[Laughs]

29:44.917 --> 29:45.949
Number one.

29:45.951 --> 29:46.984
Remember, Trinity, you know

29:46.986 --> 29:48.418
you can do this.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.887
You got this, bitch.

29:49.889 --> 29:54.491
Bianca has a soft side,
and she helps the girls.
I think that Bianca is

29:54.493 --> 29:58.495
actually a really nice person.
I think she's a--she's probably
a very sensitive person,

29:58.497 --> 30:01.732
I'm imagining.
I--and don't tell anybody
that I'm being kind, but I have

30:01.734 --> 30:05.536
another cincher if you want me
to lace you in it.
I'm down.

30:05.538 --> 30:10.641
Okay, we'll do it.
Secretly, she allowed Adore
to borrow one of her corsets

30:10.643 --> 30:17.014
in front of nine cameras.
Way to play the game, bitch.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.883
Coming up, legendary queens

30:19.885 --> 30:21.585
give new insight into the

30:21.587 --> 30:22.519
top three.

30:22.521 --> 30:23.887
For such a vicious bitch,

30:23.889 --> 30:25.122
she sure is pretty.

30:25.124 --> 30:26.990
Calm down, Beyonce.

30:26.992 --> 30:31.195
Walk.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.496
Ay, dios mio.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.031
As <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i>

30:34.033 --> 30:36.133
<i>continues.</i>

30:36.135 --> 30:37.534
<i> Okay?</i>

30:37.536 --> 30:39.603
<i> [Laughs]</i>

30:39.605 --> 30:47.711
<i> [Laughs]</i>
<i>Welcome back to</i> <i>RuPaul's drag</i>
<i>race</i> countdown to the crown.

30:47.713 --> 30:54.451
With just one week until we
crown America's next drag
superstar, it's anybody's game.

30:54.453 --> 30:58.789
Pregnant pause,
pregnant pause.
The time has come to school

30:58.791 --> 31:05.495
the children on the abcs.
Learn it, and learn it well.

31:05.497 --> 31:06.396
Fuck yeah,

31:06.398 --> 31:07.631
I'm the first one!

31:07.633 --> 31:09.700
A young queen bursting with

31:09.702 --> 31:12.436
raw talent, and the ability to

31:12.438 --> 31:16.106
charm her way out of anything.

31:16.108 --> 31:19.476
But I had to wear it, because
it was see-through, and I wanted
to show my body.

31:19.478 --> 31:23.080
[Laughter]
Adore has baby Jesus eyes.

31:23.082 --> 31:24.982
She just--you can't help but

31:24.984 --> 31:26.216
love her.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.784
I love Adore Delano, because

31:27.786 --> 31:29.419
she's like, "my dress doesn't

31:29.421 --> 31:30.721
hit the floor, and I look

31:30.723 --> 31:31.855
fucking cool."

31:31.857 --> 31:32.689
You know, I love that she's

31:32.691 --> 31:33.690
got a little bit of a messiness

31:33.692 --> 31:34.358
to her.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.025
Ow.

31:35.027 --> 31:38.195
I think a little bit of dirt
under the acrylic fingernails is
kind of hot sometimes.

31:38.197 --> 31:41.398
I'm fucking hood.
I'm from azusa.
I'll stab a bitch.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.767
She takes the critiques.

31:43.769 --> 31:44.968
She tries to grow from them,

31:44.970 --> 31:46.503
but she's still loving it.

31:46.505 --> 31:47.604
She had a breakthrough with

31:47.606 --> 31:49.172
Ru in the walkthrough.

31:49.174 --> 31:53.343
I came here to be, like,
top three and to fucking win it.
You can taste, like,

31:53.345 --> 31:58.448
ooh, girl, bitch brought it

31:58.450 --> 31:59.816
for the video shoot.

31:59.818 --> 32:05.455
Her sissy was sissying
my walk.
She was giving me sissy spacek.

32:05.457 --> 32:10.427
She's eager, she's ready,
and she sings.
oh, and if you

32:10.429 --> 32:14.865
don't believe
oh, shit.
She's gonna take my gigs.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.634
I hate her.
Party.
Adore may have started with

32:17.636 --> 32:23.507
a whimper, but she ended with
a big bang.
Will this fallen idol continue

32:23.509 --> 32:27.778
not today, Satan, not today.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.346
Bianca Del Rio was this

32:29.348 --> 32:31.581
season's mouth that roared.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.952
These people are a bunch of
assholes.
She's a killer comedian,

32:34.954 --> 32:39.423
a seasoned queen, and a damn
seamstress.
Love that dress.

32:39.425 --> 32:42.926
You can borrow it.
That dress is gorgeous.
You can borrow this one too.

32:42.928 --> 32:48.665
I'll lend it to you, girl.
Not only can she cut a dress
pattern, but she can cut you to

32:48.667 --> 32:52.169
filth.
Okay, you know what?
I'm not your mama.

32:52.171 --> 32:56.373
My name is Bianca.
Nothing gets past Bianca,
and I love that.

32:56.375 --> 33:01.378
And I got to thinking
that it was a crock of shit.
She's the bitch that I agree

33:01.380 --> 33:05.349
with.
She keeps it so real, and
everything that comes out of her

33:05.351 --> 33:10.220
mouth is just all brilliance
all the time.
she's a man with one eye

33:10.222 --> 33:11.488
at the beat of her eyelash,

33:11.490 --> 33:12.489
she could drop a freakin'

33:12.491 --> 33:13.256
one-liner.

33:13.258 --> 33:16.493
Who's helping you out?
Well, they're all helping me
out by being horrible

33:16.495 --> 33:18.328
and making me look better.
[Laughs]

33:18.330 --> 33:20.063
I was pretty flabbergasted

33:20.065 --> 33:22.232
how sweet Bianca has turned out.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.533
She's actually helped people do

33:23.535 --> 33:24.434
their make-up, cinched their

33:24.436 --> 33:26.670
body, and reached out in a time

33:26.672 --> 33:27.571
of need.

33:27.573 --> 33:33.310
If you ever need anything,
call a hateful bitch like me.
But is she really helping?

33:33.312 --> 33:36.413
You never know.
This is a competition, girls.
Come on, shake it off.

33:36.415 --> 33:38.782
Shake it off, shake it off,
pretend it's gas.
Just leave it in the hallway.

33:38.784 --> 33:45.555
Bianca Del Rio is a
take-no-prisoners professional
bitch with a heart of gold.

33:45.557 --> 33:49.359
You always end with a nasty
comment.
I always begin with one too!

33:49.361 --> 33:53.830
She's a cutthroat contender
for the crown, but she's not
alone.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.198
Is this <i>America's next top</i>

33:55.200 --> 33:56.066
<i>model?</i>

33:56.068 --> 34:01.004
<i> Enter Courtney Act.</i>
<i> I honestly want to just skin</i>
<i>you alive and wear your body.</i>

34:01.006 --> 34:06.109
<i> [Australian accent] A proven</i>
<i>singer and superstar from the</i>
<i>land down under, Courtney Act</i>

34:06.111 --> 34:09.546
<i>caught our attention from day</i>
<i>one.</i>
<i> [Squawks]</i>

34:09.548 --> 34:14.051
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> Oh, if pretty hurts,</i>
<i>Courtney is murdering us.</i>

34:14.053 --> 34:17.621
<i> Every time she walks down the</i>
<i>runway, I'm like, "who let that</i>
<i>girl in here?</i>

34:17.623 --> 34:23.193
<i>Can someone call security?</i>
<i>There's a young woman walking</i>
<i>around the main stage.</i>

34:23.195 --> 34:28.765
<i> Such a shame about that body.</i>
<i>I know she wishes she had</i>
<i>my curves and swerves, baby.</i>

34:28.767 --> 34:29.933
<i> The only thing wrong I would</i>

34:29.935 --> 34:32.135
<i>say is, you're perfect.</i>

34:32.137 --> 34:36.106
<i> Well, everyone else is</i>
<i>relying on ugly.</i>
<i>Why can't I rely on pretty?</i>

34:36.108 --> 34:41.945
<i>[Laughter]</i>
<i> She's beautiful and talented.</i>
<i>  I don't drink or eat </i>

34:41.947 --> 34:44.181
<i> or cuss </i>

34:44.183 --> 34:48.785
<i> I hate that.</i>
<i> Just when you're ready to</i>
<i>hate Courtney, she does</i>

34:48.787 --> 34:53.190
<i>something nice, you shady little</i>
<i>bitch.</i>
<i> You can find yourself a nice</i>

<i>man looking just like that.</i>
<i> You know what, you're right.</i>
<i> I just feel like I have</i>

34:57.463 --> 35:01.164
<i>a weird proportioned body.</i>
<i> Well, maybe you do,</i>
<i>and so what?</i>

35:01.166 --> 35:05.368
<i> Courtney has star quality</i>
<i>written all over her.</i>
<i> Wouldn't it be so exciting to</i>

35:05.370 --> 35:11.341
<i>have an Australian America's</i>
<i>next drag superstar?</i>
<i> Will this aussie import pull</i>

35:11.343 --> 35:18.315
<i>ahead and leave these domestic</i>
<i>models in her dust?</i>
<i> Courtney definitely has what</i>

35:18.317 --> 35:22.052
<i>it takes to be America's next</i>
<i>drag superstar, but I--</i>
<i> Bianca should win.</i>

35:22.054 --> 35:27.057
<i> I like Adore Delano, because</i>
<i>she's 22, and she's--</i>
<i> silence.</i>

35:27.059 --> 35:32.996
<i>I have not made my decision.</i>
<i>So who's team are you playing</i>
<i>for?</i>

35:32.998 --> 35:38.502
<i>Team Adore Delano,</i>
<i>team Bianca Del Rio,</i>
<i>or team Courtney Act?</i>

35:38.504 --> 35:45.175
<i>Hashtag it and tell the world</i>
<i>who you think should be crowned</i>
<i>America's next drag superstar.</i>

35:45.177 --> 35:47.577
<i> Could we just crown this</i>
<i>bitch already?</i>

35:47.579 --> 35:49.980
<i> Up next, my girls go blindly</i>

35:49.982 --> 35:51.381
<i>where no queens have gone</i>

35:51.383 --> 35:52.582

35:52.584 --> 35:53.717
<i> Okay.</i>

35:53.719 --> 35:55.185
<i> Plus, the world video</i>

35:55.187 --> 35:57.287

<i>Welcome back to</i> <i>RuPaul's</i>
<i>Drag Race</i> countdown to
the crown.

36:11.470 --> 36:18.074
Adore Delano, Bianca Del Rio,
Courtney Act, who do you
think has the biggest charisma,

36:18.076 --> 36:24.414
uniqueness, nerve, and talent?
Starting now, you've got one
week to let me and the world

36:24.416 --> 36:27.617
know.
Right, girls?
Yes, God.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.887
Absolutely.
Don't wear bacon.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.722
This season, I've been

36:32.724 --> 36:35.192
criticized for promoting too

36:35.194 --> 36:39.162
many of my products, so tonight

36:39.164 --> 36:41.698
I will not be plugging my

36:41.700 --> 36:44.234
number-one album <i>born naked.</i>

36:44.236 --> 36:45.902
