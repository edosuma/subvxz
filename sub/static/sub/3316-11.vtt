00:44.469 --> 00:46.837
Johnny, right?

00:46.905 --> 00:49.371
Pandora?

00:49.438 --> 00:51.669
That's me, honey.
New and improved.

00:51.737 --> 00:53.170
Had my baby three weeks ago.

00:57.642 --> 00:59.009
Just wanted to make sure.

00:59.077 --> 01:01.912
The pictures on the Web site

01:01.980 --> 01:04.013
don't show your beautiful face.

01:04.081 --> 01:06.917
Oh, you won't be looking at my face.

01:06.984 --> 01:09.853
Not once these triple D's
come out to play, and trust me,

01:09.921 --> 01:11.688
I haven't had one complaint yet.

01:17.761 --> 01:19.227
You understand what I want, right?

01:19.295 --> 01:21.196
Mm-hmm.

01:21.264 --> 01:24.865
You were, um...
you were very clear.

01:24.933 --> 01:27.533
I've been saving up all day, honey.

01:27.601 --> 01:30.336
Even gave my baby a bottle of formula

01:30.404 --> 01:33.773
so there's no way...
I'll run dry.

01:33.841 --> 01:35.541
Ooh.

01:36.911 --> 01:38.144
They're so juicy

01:38.212 --> 01:40.013
right now,

01:40.081 --> 01:43.851
they're ready to burst.

01:52.428 --> 01:54.696
If you hear the sound of crying,

01:54.764 --> 01:56.265
will they leak?

01:56.332 --> 01:58.567
Mmm.
'Cause I...

01:58.635 --> 02:01.603
I heard that about new mothers
and breast milk.

02:01.671 --> 02:03.405
If I hear my baby cry,

02:03.473 --> 02:05.040
I get this

02:05.108 --> 02:06.374
uncontrollable feeling,

02:06.442 --> 02:09.344
like a faucet opening,

02:09.412 --> 02:10.912
and then I find myself...

02:10.979 --> 02:12.181
Mmm.

02:12.249 --> 02:13.716
...with a soaking wet bra.

02:13.783 --> 02:15.885
Breast-feeding is so important

02:15.952 --> 02:18.354
for early development.

02:18.422 --> 02:20.790
Mm.

02:20.858 --> 02:22.959
I'm gonna take care of you, Johnny.

02:23.027 --> 02:25.495
All you need is

02:25.563 --> 02:26.729
just... a little mothering.

02:26.797 --> 02:29.666
Yeah.

02:29.734 --> 02:33.103
But... you don't
have to cry

02:33.171 --> 02:36.840
to be my baby.

02:36.908 --> 02:39.209
Mmm.

02:39.277 --> 02:41.678
Are you hungry, baby?

02:41.746 --> 02:43.880
How bad do you want to taste this?

02:46.350 --> 02:48.218
I'd kill for it.

02:50.188 --> 02:51.388
Then come to Mama.

Rise and shine.

04:19.416 --> 04:20.833
What time is it?

04:20.952 --> 04:24.606
Well, it's time for you to spend some
quality time with your baby, Papa.

04:24.726 --> 04:25.847
What have you done with him?

04:25.860 --> 04:27.695
He's received his smallpox inoculation,

04:27.743 --> 04:30.678
and he's on the schedule for
circumcision later today.

04:30.746 --> 04:32.914
Carl, you want to help Kit up?

04:32.982 --> 04:34.382
He looks a little weak in the knees.

04:34.383 --> 04:35.583
And let's get him cleaned up.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.351
What have you done with him?!

04:38.094 --> 04:40.671
What's your endgame, Thredson?
Just tell me now.

04:40.791 --> 04:43.724
Kit, you have a very limited
understanding of me.

04:43.792 --> 04:46.060
If there's anything in
this world that I hold sacred,

04:46.128 --> 04:48.330
it's a child's need
for love and protection.

04:48.397 --> 04:53.492

Carl, Pepper seems a bit agitated.

Why don't we take her for a quiet soak

05:49.058 --> 05:50.459
in the hydrotherapy room?

05:50.526 --> 05:51.860
And turn up the temperature ten degrees.

05:51.928 --> 05:53.595
See if that helps with her nerves.

Everyone else, we'll have

06:29.031 --> 06:30.698
He looks exactly like you.

06:32.834 --> 06:34.435
You want to hold him?

06:36.338 --> 06:38.072
Come on.

06:53.289 --> 06:55.190
Shh.

07:02.331 --> 07:03.999
Grace...

07:06.069 --> 07:08.336
I...

07:10.005 --> 07:11.573
There are so many questions.

07:13.409 --> 07:16.177
I don't even know where to begin.

07:16.245 --> 07:18.513
It comes back to me in pieces,

07:18.581 --> 07:20.948
but they're like shards of broken glass.

07:21.016 --> 07:24.152
They don't... they
don't fit together.

07:24.219 --> 07:27.655
Just tell me what you remember.

07:27.723 --> 07:29.524
Anything.

07:37.100 --> 07:38.767
<i>I prayed for death.</i>

07:41.838 --> 07:44.139
I thought my prayers were answered

07:44.207 --> 07:45.808
when I saw a bright, white light.

07:47.811 --> 07:51.380
Just like old people talk about.

07:51.448 --> 07:53.683
<i>I thought it was heaven.</i>

08:09.300 --> 08:13.103
<i>I felt like I was being torn in half.</i>

08:16.408 --> 08:18.242
I didn't think I could survive it.

08:20.545 --> 08:23.481
But it was him.

08:25.217 --> 08:27.552
Our baby.

08:30.155 --> 08:32.256
They were putting him inside me.

08:34.192 --> 08:37.193
How did he grow so fast?

08:37.260 --> 08:38.794
Time works differently up there.

08:38.861 --> 08:42.097
It felt like a hundred years to me.

08:42.166 --> 08:45.100
They're not like us, Kit.

08:45.168 --> 08:46.735
They're not cruel.

08:48.104 --> 08:50.072
And Alma?

08:50.140 --> 08:52.374
You said you saw her,

08:52.442 --> 08:54.109
she was alive.

08:54.177 --> 08:56.345
They're not perfect, Kit.

08:56.413 --> 08:59.181
They make mistakes.

09:21.005 --> 09:23.639
<i>I'm so sorry, Kit.</i>

09:25.876 --> 09:28.477
<i>I know how much you loved her.</i>

09:34.917 --> 09:36.585
All the plans you made.

09:36.653 --> 09:39.621
To have children, build a life.

09:42.058 --> 09:43.959
You wanted all that with Alma, not me.

09:44.026 --> 09:45.927
What did they want with her?

09:45.995 --> 09:48.163
With either of you?

09:48.231 --> 09:49.664
Our only link is you.

09:49.732 --> 09:51.032
What?

09:51.100 --> 09:52.834
What?

09:52.902 --> 09:55.503
You're special, Kit.

09:55.571 --> 09:59.174
Our baby is special.

09:59.241 --> 10:02.277
People will listen to him.

10:02.344 --> 10:04.912
He's going to change
the way people think.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.015
Well,

10:07.082 --> 10:09.183
I don't know about all that.

10:09.251 --> 10:12.086
I just want to be
a decent father to him.

10:13.489 --> 10:16.257
Alma would want that.

10:20.730 --> 10:23.699
She'd want me to do the right thing.

10:26.269 --> 10:28.837
Marry me, Grace.

10:36.745 --> 10:38.278
That a yeah?

10:38.346 --> 10:39.546
Yeah.

11:00.568 --> 11:02.769
Maybe the monsignor
can marry us.

11:02.837 --> 11:05.038
Grace. Kit.

11:05.106 --> 11:06.340
I'd like to introduce you to

11:06.408 --> 11:08.108
Sister Colette.

11:08.176 --> 11:10.377
She's here from St. Ursula's
Home for Lost Children.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.947
I'm sorry to say
she's here for the baby.

11:13.015 --> 11:15.749
We have
an excellent track record

11:15.817 --> 11:17.918
at placing lost children
in loving homes.

11:17.986 --> 11:21.788
He's not a lost child-- I'm
his mother, this is his father.

11:21.856 --> 11:23.323
A pair of crazies in an asylum.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.358
Not exactly a Norman Rockwell.

11:25.426 --> 11:27.394
You're not taking him.

11:27.461 --> 11:30.063
I'm sure this is difficult
for you, but we have to consider

11:30.131 --> 11:31.497
what's best for the child.
That's bullshit!

11:31.565 --> 11:33.366
A baby belongs with its mother,
everybody knows that.

11:33.434 --> 11:34.567
Give me the baby.
Forget it!

11:34.635 --> 11:35.515
Give me the baby!
Stop!

11:37.905 --> 11:39.172
You call yourself Christians?!

11:39.240 --> 11:41.007
My baby!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.842
I'll get him back for you, I swear!

11:42.910 --> 11:45.378
Kit, I am so sorry.

11:45.446 --> 11:47.714
I can only imagine the heartache

11:47.781 --> 11:49.082
of having your only son
ripped from your arms.

11:51.318 --> 11:52.352
Maybe I can help.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.357
Lana Winters?

11:57.425 --> 11:58.492
Yes?

11:58.559 --> 11:59.893
Please come with me.

11:59.961 --> 12:01.361
Why?

12:01.429 --> 12:03.463
I'm taking you out of this place,

12:03.531 --> 12:04.598
but we must be quick.

12:04.666 --> 12:06.533
I don't know you.

12:06.601 --> 12:09.203
My name is Mother Claudia.

12:09.270 --> 12:10.704
I am a friend.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.272
I don't have friends in this place.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.874
You have at least one.

12:16.378 --> 12:18.580
She told me what she did to you.

12:18.647 --> 12:20.715
And she's asked me to make it right.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.051
You can't make it right.

12:23.118 --> 12:24.118
No.

12:25.187 --> 12:27.422
But maybe you can.

12:27.490 --> 12:30.292
In some measure.

12:30.359 --> 12:33.061
Your patient file.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.764
Documentation of every

12:35.832 --> 12:37.867
foul thing that was done to you here.

12:37.935 --> 12:40.036
Trust me when I tell you
it can't possibly all be

12:40.104 --> 12:41.571
in that file.

12:41.639 --> 12:43.574
Which is why you need
it for your exposé.

12:43.641 --> 12:46.410
It's irrefutable proof
that you were here.

12:46.478 --> 12:47.945
When your story comes out,

12:48.013 --> 12:50.080
there are those who will
try to deny even that.

12:50.148 --> 12:53.017
You want this place shut down.

12:53.084 --> 12:56.253
I want it pulled down
and the earth salted.

12:56.321 --> 12:58.088
Now...

12:58.156 --> 13:00.324
the clothes you wore
when you were admitted,

13:00.392 --> 13:01.826
along with your personal effects,

13:01.894 --> 13:04.428
are in the lavatory next door.

13:04.496 --> 13:05.463
There's a taxicab on its way here now

13:05.530 --> 13:06.697
that will take you

13:06.765 --> 13:08.199
wherever you want to go.

13:08.267 --> 13:09.600
But we must hurry.

13:09.668 --> 13:11.102
All right.

13:13.905 --> 13:14.738
Hang on.

13:23.448 --> 13:24.348
That goes with me.

13:27.718 --> 13:29.720
There's just one more thing.

13:35.493 --> 13:37.727
Sister Jude.
It's Lana Winters.

13:37.795 --> 13:40.163
Your friend Mother Claudia's
taking me out of this place,

13:40.230 --> 13:41.765
and she says that's because of you.

13:45.102 --> 13:47.304
I'm coming back for you, Jude.

13:47.371 --> 13:48.405
I won't leave you here.

13:58.117 --> 14:00.352
We both know if I get
you that tape, I'm done for.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.981
You won't really do anything to help me.

14:02.021 --> 14:04.089
You're wrong, Kit.

14:04.157 --> 14:06.458
Get me that tape,
and I will not only see to it

14:06.526 --> 14:08.294
that your son is not swallowed
by the system,

14:08.361 --> 14:09.862
but I will also do
everything in my power

14:09.929 --> 14:12.431
to secure your freedom,
so you can be with him again.

14:12.499 --> 14:14.066
You and Grace, together as a family.

14:15.201 --> 14:16.168
I mean it.

14:18.204 --> 14:19.565
Well, how do you figure to do that?

14:20.974 --> 14:22.474
Well, for one,

14:22.542 --> 14:24.910
the police are going to need
a new, credible suspect

14:24.978 --> 14:26.178
for the Bloody Face killings.

14:26.246 --> 14:27.179
I got one for 'em.

14:27.247 --> 14:28.280
So have I.

14:28.348 --> 14:30.383
Dr. Arthur Arden.

14:30.450 --> 14:31.951
I understand he's come under
suspicion a number of times

14:32.019 --> 14:33.954
already, and with his sudden
disappearance...

14:36.424 --> 14:37.791
...his guilt
is plausible.

14:37.859 --> 14:41.095
But Lana...
she, uh...

14:41.162 --> 14:42.496
she'll never tell me
where that tape's at.

14:42.564 --> 14:44.532
I made her swear not to.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.800
Just talk to her.

14:45.867 --> 14:47.068
Try to get her to see reason.

14:47.135 --> 14:48.602
Yeah, well, what if she won't?

14:48.670 --> 14:51.639
I mean...

14:51.706 --> 14:54.074
she can be pretty stubborn
when she wants.

14:54.142 --> 14:56.544
She's a spirited girl.

14:56.611 --> 15:00.214
If anyone can reach her...

15:00.282 --> 15:01.282
it's you.

15:01.349 --> 15:03.717
Okay.

15:03.785 --> 15:04.985
I'll try.

16:10.317 --> 16:12.018
In a hurry, Oliver?

16:12.086 --> 16:14.273
Quick trip out of town?

16:18.359 --> 16:19.860
Good.

16:19.927 --> 16:21.495
You are here.

16:21.562 --> 16:23.063
Saves me the trouble of
having to look for you.

16:23.131 --> 16:24.464
Did you come here just
to bring me the tape?

16:24.532 --> 16:25.732
The police have the tape.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.302
They're going to be here very soon.

16:28.369 --> 16:30.103
It's over.

16:31.872 --> 16:34.140
You've been exposed.

16:37.978 --> 16:39.212
That's it?

16:39.279 --> 16:41.314
It's done.

16:43.316 --> 16:44.650
I knew this would happen one day.

16:44.718 --> 16:46.485
I wondered how

16:46.553 --> 16:47.586
I would feel.

16:47.654 --> 16:49.188
I thought I would go crazy,

16:49.255 --> 16:50.789
but I'm actually relieved.

16:50.857 --> 16:52.090
Living with secrets

16:52.158 --> 16:55.293
is not... healthy.

16:57.162 --> 16:58.396
I was right, Lana.

16:59.765 --> 17:00.999
I knew...

17:01.066 --> 17:02.901
you were the one.

17:02.969 --> 17:04.002
I am the one.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.002
I am the one

17:06.070 --> 17:09.040
that's going to put your ass
in that electric chair.

17:09.108 --> 17:12.410
You're gonna pay for every
sick thing you did to me,

17:12.477 --> 17:14.377
to Wendy,

17:14.445 --> 17:16.513
and to every other woman you murdered.

17:21.219 --> 17:22.499
Where do you think you're going?

17:24.656 --> 17:25.890
Making myself a drink.

17:25.957 --> 17:27.358
Care to join me?

17:33.031 --> 17:34.732
Sit down.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.835
There is no
alcohol where I'm going.

17:36.902 --> 17:38.336
I'm not gonna let you

17:38.404 --> 17:41.272
take away my last chance
to have a martini.

17:49.916 --> 17:50.983
You sure you won't change your mind?

17:51.050 --> 17:53.352
You think I'm crazy.

17:54.787 --> 17:56.454
Oh, wait.

17:56.522 --> 17:57.856
That'd be you.

17:57.923 --> 17:59.390
I think we established that

17:59.458 --> 18:00.792
when you chained me to the bed

18:00.859 --> 18:02.126
and called me Mommy.

18:12.570 --> 18:15.038
Go ahead, baby,
you can call me Mommy.

18:26.884 --> 18:29.886
You'd be surprised how many...

18:29.953 --> 18:31.921
how many men have mommy issues.

18:35.026 --> 18:36.593
You think that's my problem?

18:36.661 --> 18:38.896
From the way you drained my tit?

18:38.964 --> 18:41.532
I'd either say that you
have a mommy fixation,

18:41.600 --> 18:44.602
or... a calcium
deficiency.

18:46.505 --> 18:49.140
Oh, honey, I'm just kidding.

18:49.208 --> 18:52.143
I just want to slow you down.

18:52.211 --> 18:54.378
Make sure you're enjoying yourself.

18:56.248 --> 18:58.983
You're right.

18:59.051 --> 19:01.385
I'm fixated.

19:01.453 --> 19:03.554
I'm stuck on that cold bitch.

19:03.622 --> 19:06.190
Oh, honey.

19:06.258 --> 19:08.426
You tell me all about her.

19:10.162 --> 19:13.231
<i>She never loved me.</i>

19:13.298 --> 19:15.466
<i>She didn't love my father.</i>

19:17.636 --> 19:20.371
<i>There was only one person</i>
<i>she ever loved.</i>

19:20.439 --> 19:21.539
Tell me what you did

19:21.607 --> 19:23.174
with Wendy's body.

19:23.242 --> 19:25.544
Nobody cares about
a spinster schoolteacher.

19:25.612 --> 19:26.779
Not the cops,

19:26.846 --> 19:30.382
nor the school, or her family.

19:30.450 --> 19:32.985
Everyone knows what she was.

19:33.053 --> 19:34.820
What we were together.

19:34.888 --> 19:37.589
And I'm the only one who gives a damn.

19:39.458 --> 19:41.159
She deserves a proper burial.

19:50.570 --> 19:52.470
Her story's pretty complicated.

19:52.538 --> 19:54.206
Are you sure you want to hear
all the details?

19:54.273 --> 19:55.340
I want to know everything.

20:03.684 --> 20:06.953
She was the first body I had
that remained... intact.

20:08.589 --> 20:10.590
I put her on ice just for you.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.694
I was gonna dispose of the body, but...

20:14.762 --> 20:17.296
once I realized how well things
were going with us,

20:17.364 --> 20:18.832
I thought she could come in handy.

20:18.899 --> 20:22.235
For practice, you know.

20:22.303 --> 20:24.204
<i>It was awkward at first.</i>

20:24.271 --> 20:27.441
<i>Every approach I made</i>
<i>felt false, artificial.</i>

20:27.508 --> 20:29.409
<i>I felt like she was watching me.</i>

20:29.477 --> 20:31.545
<i>Being judgmental.</i>

20:31.613 --> 20:33.814
<i>I must confess, I couldn't do it.</i>

20:33.882 --> 20:36.049
<i>I thought about plucking out her eyes.</i>

20:36.117 --> 20:38.118
<i>But then I thought, that's not real,</i>

20:38.186 --> 20:39.319
I need to make this work.

20:39.387 --> 20:41.689
<i>So I turned her around.</i>

20:45.460 --> 20:47.294
And finally it happened.

20:49.965 --> 20:51.332
More than once.

20:52.567 --> 20:54.535
It was a triumph.

20:54.603 --> 20:58.239
Better than I ever
thought possible, Lana.

20:58.306 --> 21:00.140
Wendy allowed us to create

21:00.208 --> 21:01.809
this life you have growing
inside of you.

21:05.614 --> 21:07.048
It's a little miracle,
if you think about it.

21:07.115 --> 21:08.582
Where is her body, goddamn it?

21:08.650 --> 21:10.051
Well, after you left me,

21:10.118 --> 21:11.419
I had to dispose of all the evidence.

21:11.487 --> 21:13.020
So what I couldn't burn,

21:13.088 --> 21:14.855
I cut up.

21:14.923 --> 21:16.824
There are pieces of her

21:16.892 --> 21:18.659
scattered from Plymouth to Springfield.

21:18.727 --> 21:20.327
But you know what, Lana?

21:22.530 --> 21:24.731
We'll always have Paris.

21:32.039 --> 21:34.106
Let go, baby.

21:34.174 --> 21:35.774
Cry your heart out.

21:35.842 --> 21:37.943
There's no shame in tears.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.718
It's my mother.

21:45.786 --> 21:47.420
She's the one!
The only one

21:47.488 --> 21:49.055
who can make me feel this way.

21:49.122 --> 21:50.957
Every time I think about her,

21:51.025 --> 21:52.259
it makes me want to do things.

21:53.628 --> 21:56.063
Bad things!
Johnny...

21:56.131 --> 21:57.664
Don't let that bitch ruin
our whole night.

21:57.732 --> 21:59.266
Now, look at me.

21:59.334 --> 22:01.102
I have a rockin' body
and a titty full of milk.

22:01.169 --> 22:03.004
Let me help you forget about her.

22:03.072 --> 22:05.973
You think it's easy?
You think it's easy?

22:06.041 --> 22:08.743
Come on, baby.
I can't forget.

22:08.811 --> 22:10.846
Come on, I'm about to
burst out of my skin.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.381
Do me a favor and just
give me some relief.

22:13.817 --> 22:15.284
Please! Oh, God.

22:15.351 --> 22:17.953
No! Please,
baby, oh, stop.

22:18.021 --> 22:19.106
Stop! Stop!

22:19.226 --> 22:21.097
You know what bitch did, don't you?

22:21.217 --> 22:23.534
Stop, stop, please!

22:28.644 --> 22:29.766
Time for a refill.

22:37.166 --> 22:38.600
They're here.

22:39.635 --> 22:40.769
Drink up.

22:41.396 --> 22:43.620
This is your last taste of alcohol.

22:45.608 --> 22:47.041
Now that you're out of Briarcliff,

22:47.109 --> 22:47.913
you'll never keep that baby, will you?

22:47.990 --> 22:49.506
Not a chance in hell.
So I shouldn't

22:49.626 --> 22:50.626
expect a little Oliver

22:50.694 --> 22:51.733
to come visit every few months?

22:51.853 --> 22:53.429
Oh, even if I had this thing,

22:53.497 --> 22:54.464
you'd never see him.

22:54.531 --> 22:56.799
You're gonna fry in that chair.

22:58.802 --> 23:00.188
I hardly think so, Lana.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.676
I'm clearly insane.

23:06.744 --> 23:08.511
I'll be institutionalized.

23:08.579 --> 23:10.580
At the very worst, I'll live
a long life in prison.

23:10.648 --> 23:12.682
Maybe I'll even start
some therapy groups.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.784
God knows there are
some disturbed individuals

23:14.851 --> 23:16.519
behind bars.

23:18.322 --> 23:19.255
As for you...

23:20.590 --> 23:22.091
...I have no use for you

23:22.158 --> 23:23.392
anymore.

23:23.934 --> 23:25.505
Best you should just be known as

23:25.625 --> 23:27.029
my last victim.

23:29.899 --> 23:32.167
Prison's too good for you.

23:52.501 --> 23:54.235
I can't believe
the cops didn't find

23:54.303 --> 23:55.480
anything connected to her.

23:55.789 --> 23:58.306
No bones, nothing.
Jesus, Lois,

23:58.374 --> 24:00.508
is this really
the place? Really?

24:00.576 --> 24:02.043
It's fine.

24:02.111 --> 24:05.447
They found a lot of
ashes in the furnace.

24:05.514 --> 24:08.417
I know maybe it's not all Wendy, but...

24:08.485 --> 24:10.419
I just needed a place to visit...

24:11.988 --> 24:14.390
...a place where I can
remember her.

24:14.457 --> 24:15.591
Of course.

24:15.659 --> 24:17.760
You did the right thing, Lana.

24:17.828 --> 24:19.728
So, are you going to

24:19.796 --> 24:21.463
move back into your house?

24:21.531 --> 24:23.065
'Cause... it's
a big place,

24:23.133 --> 24:24.600
and if you need a roommate...

24:24.668 --> 24:25.802
I have a couple of things

24:25.869 --> 24:26.836
I need to tidy up,

24:26.904 --> 24:28.171
and...

24:28.238 --> 24:29.772
when I'm finished, I've decided

24:29.840 --> 24:31.173
to move to New York.

24:34.811 --> 24:37.946
I can't help but feel this is my fault.

24:38.014 --> 24:39.882
Don't do that, Lana.

24:39.949 --> 24:42.551
It is not your fault.

24:42.619 --> 24:44.387
This was the work of a crazed maniac.

24:44.454 --> 24:46.255
A man you had to kill
in self-defense.

24:48.024 --> 24:49.658
If anyone, it was that nun.

24:49.726 --> 24:50.793
No.

24:52.028 --> 24:54.664
It was the story.

24:54.731 --> 24:57.466
I was going to do anything
to get that story.

24:59.636 --> 25:02.405
I just didn't realize how much
it was going to cost.

25:05.143 --> 25:06.476
You still have the address

25:06.544 --> 25:08.378
I gave you?

25:08.446 --> 25:10.213
She's a real doctor. A good one.

25:10.281 --> 25:11.582
She'll take care

25:11.649 --> 25:12.716
of your little problem.

25:12.784 --> 25:13.717
Thank you.

25:13.785 --> 25:15.119
Both of you.

25:15.187 --> 25:17.054
I don't know what I would do...

25:18.590 --> 25:20.324
- Shit, they found us.
- Hey.

25:20.392 --> 25:22.627
Goddamn vultures.
Oh, sorry, Lana.

25:22.694 --> 25:23.994
I... forgot you're
one of 'em.

25:24.062 --> 25:26.431
No, we are vultures.

25:27.966 --> 25:29.700
Attracted to the scent of rotting meat.

25:29.768 --> 25:31.335
If you don't

25:31.402 --> 25:33.003
want to be linked
to the "Sapphic Reporter,"

25:33.071 --> 25:34.371
you should leave through the back gate.

25:34.439 --> 25:36.273
Yeah, I better.

25:36.340 --> 25:39.075
No one in my family suspects.

25:44.081 --> 25:45.481
Sorry to abandon you.

25:46.683 --> 25:48.950
I still have a job because

25:49.018 --> 25:50.938
my lecherous boss thinks
he has a chance with me.

26:21.784 --> 26:24.185
Miss Winters, can you give us any more

26:24.253 --> 26:26.254
details about how Bloody Face
tortured you

26:26.322 --> 26:27.322
- when you were his captive?
- Sources tell me

26:27.389 --> 26:28.522
you've obtained the services

26:28.590 --> 26:30.291
of Cohen and Mathews--

26:30.358 --> 26:31.692
they're the best lawyers in town.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.494
Are you planning to sue?
Any truth to the rumors that

26:33.561 --> 26:34.862
you received electroshock
treatment daily?

26:34.930 --> 26:36.697
Lana, do you have any comment

26:36.765 --> 26:38.199
about your reported homosexuality?

26:42.537 --> 26:45.239
Please, Miss Winters!
Miss Winters, talk to us!

26:45.307 --> 26:47.609
All I can say is...

26:47.676 --> 26:48.777
read my book.

26:48.844 --> 26:50.278

Come.

28:02.988 --> 28:05.790
Brother James, those reporters
who were here when I arrived,

28:05.858 --> 28:07.492
have they been removed
from the premises?

28:07.559 --> 28:09.460
From the immediate grounds.

28:09.528 --> 28:13.031
There's nothing I can do about
those camped outside the gates.

28:13.099 --> 28:15.567
Hopefully if we remain
resolute in our silence,

28:15.635 --> 28:18.737
they'll eventually tire...

28:18.805 --> 28:20.773
and go away.

28:20.841 --> 28:23.976
Monsignor, there's been a disturbance

28:48.502 --> 28:51.203
or you'd be in solitary right now.

28:51.271 --> 28:53.905
She got one thing right,

28:53.973 --> 28:56.908
that Devil of yours.

28:56.976 --> 29:01.646
This jukebox has
a strange healing effect,

29:01.714 --> 29:02.981
it keeps the joy alive.

29:07.787 --> 29:09.888
What did you want to see me about?

29:14.426 --> 29:17.896
Have you fully recognized

29:17.963 --> 29:19.964
the irony here?

29:20.032 --> 29:22.700
You relinquished your virtue

29:22.768 --> 29:24.868
not to a loving woman,

29:24.936 --> 29:27.170
but to the Devil.

29:27.238 --> 29:30.674
It's so perfect--
it's perfect, it's perfect.

29:30.742 --> 29:33.044
I don't want to hear you talk like this.

29:33.111 --> 29:35.179
I don't know this person.

29:39.018 --> 29:40.351
What have you decided to do?

29:42.288 --> 29:44.089
Renounce your vows?

29:45.659 --> 29:47.793
Not at all.

29:47.861 --> 29:49.462
I'm going to stay the course.

29:49.529 --> 29:53.499
I have too much to give,
too much to offer.

29:53.567 --> 29:54.967
I can't just

29:55.035 --> 29:57.370
throw it all away.

29:57.437 --> 30:00.039
I thought you hung the moon, Timothy.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.010
I had impure thoughts,
I'll admit to that.

30:04.078 --> 30:06.112
But I would have done

30:06.180 --> 30:09.015
anything for you,

30:09.083 --> 30:13.719
I would've done anything
you asked me to do,

30:13.787 --> 30:16.588
that's how much I believed
in your fantasy

30:16.656 --> 30:19.191
of the magic carpet ride to Rome.

30:22.394 --> 30:24.262
Believe me, Jude,

30:24.330 --> 30:27.166
it's not a fantasy.

30:27.234 --> 30:29.535
Brother Matthew? Carl?

30:29.603 --> 30:32.204
Can you imagine

30:32.272 --> 30:33.772
the disillusionment,

30:33.840 --> 30:38.143
the shame and the disgust I feel

30:38.211 --> 30:40.778
now that I see through you

30:40.846 --> 30:44.949
and your stupid, pitiful,
naked ambition?

30:45.016 --> 30:46.950
Shut your filthy mouth!

30:47.018 --> 30:50.153
You're an embarrassment.

30:51.756 --> 30:53.323
It's an extraordinary thing.

30:53.391 --> 30:55.459
You know that?

30:55.527 --> 30:57.861
You throw me in the madhouse,

30:57.929 --> 31:00.598
you strip away everything I have,

31:00.665 --> 31:03.300
everything I know,

31:03.368 --> 31:04.869
you treat me like a rabid dog,

31:04.936 --> 31:06.303
like a madwoman.

31:06.371 --> 31:09.474
And you know what happens?

31:09.542 --> 31:13.778
I'm blessed with the gift
of total clarity.

31:13.846 --> 31:15.814
I am more sane

31:15.882 --> 31:19.084
now as a madwoman than I ever was

31:19.152 --> 31:21.186
as the head of Briarcliff.

31:21.254 --> 31:24.255
You sound mad as a hatter.

31:26.926 --> 31:29.795
Oh, Carl.

31:29.862 --> 31:31.963
Jude needs some time alone

31:32.031 --> 31:35.801
to reflect and pray for guidance.

31:35.869 --> 31:38.270
Take her to solitary.

31:38.338 --> 31:40.807
You will not prevail, Timothy.

31:40.874 --> 31:42.775
My God would

31:42.843 --> 31:45.645
never allow it.

31:59.559 --> 32:02.327
Sign here.

32:02.395 --> 32:03.629
And here.

32:03.696 --> 32:06.431
What for?

32:06.499 --> 32:07.632
Your release papers.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.501
They're letting you out, Kit.

32:15.408 --> 32:17.075
Thredson-- they caught him?

32:17.143 --> 32:18.810
Lana gave them the tape?

32:18.878 --> 32:20.112
Yeah, and she did one better.

32:20.180 --> 32:22.014
The lezzie blew his head off.

32:22.082 --> 32:24.183
It's all over the papers.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.118
Reporters are hanging off the rafters,

32:26.186 --> 32:27.285
trying to sniff out

32:27.353 --> 32:30.055
the "Corruption at Briarcliff."

32:30.122 --> 32:32.256
That's why you're suddenly a free man.

32:35.294 --> 32:36.628
Clothes from the Salvation Army.

32:36.695 --> 32:38.129
They should fit you--
just leave

32:38.197 --> 32:40.165
what you're wearing on the bed.

32:54.881 --> 32:55.914
Wait.

32:57.717 --> 33:02.254
I have to see the monsignor.

33:02.321 --> 33:03.755
Mr. Walker,

33:03.823 --> 33:07.025
I can't tell you how pleased I am

33:07.092 --> 33:09.593
that justice has finally been served.

33:09.661 --> 33:12.563
I'm only happy to have been
a small part of that.

33:12.631 --> 33:14.232
This isn't justice.

33:14.299 --> 33:15.933
I don't understand.
You're a free man.

33:16.001 --> 33:16.968
What more could you want?

33:17.035 --> 33:18.136
I want my son back.

33:18.203 --> 33:19.504
Your son?

33:19.572 --> 33:21.006
You took him from our arms.

33:21.073 --> 33:24.042
He's got two parents--
me and Grace.

33:24.110 --> 33:25.377
And we aim to raise him as a family.

33:25.445 --> 33:27.079
That's hardly possible, is it?

33:27.147 --> 33:29.781
Given that you've just been released

33:29.849 --> 33:33.185
and Miss Bertrand's confined here.

33:33.253 --> 33:34.720
That's why you're gonna let her out.

33:34.788 --> 33:36.121
I beg your pardon?

33:36.189 --> 33:38.157
You're gonna let Grace
out of this place.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.593
Then you're gonna call
over to St. Ursula's

33:40.661 --> 33:43.162
and tell them little Thomas'
folks are coming to pick him up.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.497
If you do that,

33:45.565 --> 33:47.332
we'll never bother you again.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.968
Otherwise,

33:50.036 --> 33:52.037
I might have to start talking
to those reporters.

33:52.105 --> 33:53.439
And believe me,

33:53.506 --> 33:55.707
I have a lot of stories.

33:55.775 --> 33:59.211
I bet you do.

33:59.278 --> 34:03.048
Be reasonable, you can't
seriously expect me to release

34:03.116 --> 34:06.352
an axe murderess
back into the community.

34:06.420 --> 34:07.486
I'm not asking you to.

34:07.554 --> 34:09.321
All you got to do is

34:09.389 --> 34:10.755
release her body to me.

34:10.824 --> 34:12.690
Her body?

34:12.759 --> 34:14.460
Is this a riddle?

34:14.527 --> 34:16.996
Grace isn't dead.
Look at her file.

34:17.063 --> 34:18.764
In it you'll find a death certificate

34:18.833 --> 34:20.699
made out by Dr. Arden
before he disappeared.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.703
Frank McCann signed it as a witness.

34:22.770 --> 34:24.337
Her death certificate?

34:24.404 --> 34:27.540
Officially, if anybody ever asks,

34:27.607 --> 34:29.909
Grace Bertrand died here.

34:29.976 --> 34:32.545
It's already taken care of.

34:32.612 --> 34:33.913
You don't got to lie.

34:33.981 --> 34:35.715
I don't got to tell the truth.

34:35.783 --> 34:38.319
You can make all your
problems go away, Father.

34:38.386 --> 34:41.388
Nobody ever needs to know.

34:48.563 --> 34:49.998
Wait.

34:50.065 --> 34:52.132
Let me get the door.

34:55.070 --> 34:57.138
Here you go.

35:00.609 --> 35:02.476
This is yours?

35:02.544 --> 35:04.478
Home sweet home.

35:07.282 --> 35:09.850
'Kay, this is your home, too.

35:12.871 --> 35:14.222
Come on.

35:16.158 --> 35:19.393
I thought maybe, uh...

35:19.461 --> 35:22.496
we could get a horse.
A horse?

35:22.564 --> 35:24.432
Yeah, as long as you take care of it.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.867
I don't know jack shit
about horses.

35:32.574 --> 35:34.341
Still there.

35:44.252 --> 35:46.720
Don't expect a castle.

35:46.788 --> 35:49.223
Open the goddamn door.

35:59.635 --> 36:02.470
I never got a chance to clean up.

36:02.537 --> 36:03.804
I'm sorry.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.172
Don't be.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.208
We can do it together.

36:07.276 --> 36:08.921
It's a great house.

36:09.041 --> 36:11.345
And it's not Briarcliff.

36:11.692 --> 36:14.215
It's not Briarcliff.

36:22.691 --> 36:24.759
Hello?

36:28.226 --> 36:30.064
Hey!

36:42.406 --> 36:43.739
You okay?

36:43.807 --> 36:45.974
You're sure this is what you want?

36:46.042 --> 36:47.842
Oh, yes.

36:47.910 --> 36:50.078
There's no doubt about it.

36:52.114 --> 36:55.683
This is not a baby I want
to carry around inside me.

37:00.489 --> 37:04.693
In a different life, I would
have loved to have had a baby.

37:07.097 --> 37:11.400
But my lover was murdered...

37:11.468 --> 37:14.903
by the man who raped me...
and got me pregnant.

37:16.306 --> 37:18.374
Oh, my God.

37:20.844 --> 37:23.179
I'm glad you found me.

37:26.750 --> 37:29.051
Let's get started.

37:29.119 --> 37:32.254
Remove everything from the waist down.

37:58.780 --> 38:00.948
I take it everything's
been sterilized.

38:01.015 --> 38:03.650
I soak them in boiling water.

38:03.718 --> 38:06.252
There's an electric teakettle.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.055
Those sterilizing machines
are too cumbersome

38:09.123 --> 38:11.424
to smuggle out of the hospital.

38:11.492 --> 38:14.494
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

38:25.349 --> 38:28.274
Now, open your legs, Jane.

38:35.082 --> 38:36.482
I'm gonna have to ask you

38:36.550 --> 38:38.484
not to make any more sounds.

38:38.552 --> 38:40.253
As I explained to you earlier,

38:40.321 --> 38:42.522
we can't afford to draw
attention to ourselves.

38:42.590 --> 38:43.790
I'm sorry.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.993
A little wider, honey.

38:49.262 --> 38:50.329
A little wider, honey.

38:57.071 --> 38:58.938
Stop!

39:00.941 --> 39:02.675
I can't.

39:05.413 --> 39:09.049
No more death.

39:11.386 --> 39:13.220
No more.

39:18.559 --> 39:19.826
That's a lot of dead people.

39:19.894 --> 39:21.061
If that's what they are.

39:23.431 --> 39:25.865
I'm not saying they're all dead.

39:25.933 --> 39:27.567
I'm saying they all
disappeared from Briarcliff

39:27.635 --> 39:29.135
in the last two years,

39:29.203 --> 39:31.271
all under suspicious circumstances.

39:31.338 --> 39:33.372
Five of them in just
the short time I was there.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.975
Should you be upsetting
yourself, uh, Miss Winters?

39:36.043 --> 39:37.777
I'm fine.

39:37.844 --> 39:40.846
I'm not upsetting myself;
you're upsetting me.

39:40.914 --> 39:43.249
You're not listening to what I'm saying.
No, we <i>are</i> listening.

39:43.317 --> 39:44.951
I'm just not sure
what you want us to do.

39:45.018 --> 39:47.353
I want you to get me back in there.

39:47.421 --> 39:49.889
There is one person there
who can substantiate

39:49.957 --> 39:53.293
every allegation I've made--
she used to run the place.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.227
Sister Jude?

39:54.295 --> 39:56.463
She's a patient there now.

39:56.530 --> 39:57.964
She's being held against her will.

39:58.032 --> 39:59.599
They won't let me see her.

39:59.667 --> 40:00.967
They won't even let me
in the front door.

40:01.035 --> 40:03.870
Well, they are a private institution.

40:03.938 --> 40:05.104
Yes, but if you got a court order...

40:05.172 --> 40:06.472
What about this Mother Superior?

40:06.540 --> 40:09.309
The one you say got
you out-- Claudia.

40:09.376 --> 40:11.444
Can't she help you?
Transferred to Puerto Rico.

40:11.512 --> 40:13.079
The moment she started making noise,

40:13.146 --> 40:15.247
the Archdiocese got rid of her.

40:15.315 --> 40:16.849
Please.

40:18.718 --> 40:20.752
Will you help me?

40:20.820 --> 40:22.821
That's his baby, isn't it?

40:22.889 --> 40:24.523
Bloody Face--
he's the father.

40:28.027 --> 40:30.629
This baby doesn't have a father.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.133
You're one tough cookie,

40:34.201 --> 40:35.401
you know that?

40:35.469 --> 40:36.369
I <i>am</i> tough.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.308
But I'm no cookie.

40:49.784 --> 40:51.085
Timothy Howard?

40:51.152 --> 40:52.686
I'm sorry, Monsignor.

40:52.754 --> 40:54.788
What's the meaning of this?

40:54.856 --> 40:57.358
This is a court order giving us
access to one of your patients.

40:57.425 --> 40:58.625
Sister Jude--

40:58.693 --> 41:01.428
we want to speak to her right now.

41:09.137 --> 41:11.371
I'm afraid that's impossible.

41:11.438 --> 41:13.506
I don't give a shit
how many pills you've got

41:13.574 --> 41:15.107
her doped up with.

41:15.175 --> 41:16.609
Sister Jude is dead.

41:16.676 --> 41:19.478
I don't believe you.

41:19.546 --> 41:20.713
Brother James, fetch me the paperwork

41:20.780 --> 41:21.947
on Sister Jude, please?

41:22.015 --> 41:23.248
He's lying.

41:23.316 --> 41:24.917
I only wish I were.

41:26.253 --> 41:28.387
It was the saddest day
I've ever experienced

41:28.455 --> 41:31.290
when I walked into her room
and found her like that.

41:36.697 --> 41:38.731
<i>She'd done it during the night.</i>

41:38.798 --> 41:41.967
<i>Fashioned a rope from her bedsheets.</i>

41:42.035 --> 41:44.937
A summary of how she was found.

41:45.005 --> 41:46.772
Her death certificate.

41:48.976 --> 41:52.145
And this number indicates
the can in storage

41:52.212 --> 41:54.080
containing her ashes.

41:54.148 --> 41:56.049
You had her cremated?

41:56.117 --> 41:57.517
She died outside a state of grace.

41:57.585 --> 41:59.854
I could give no last rites,
no absolution.

41:59.921 --> 42:03.491
She was, tragically,
denied a Christian burial.

42:03.559 --> 42:06.728
Though I keep her
in my personal prayers.

42:06.796 --> 42:07.929
You murdered her.

42:07.997 --> 42:09.164
You might as well have tied

42:09.231 --> 42:11.066
the noose yourself.

42:11.133 --> 42:12.901
I wanted only good for Sister Jude.

42:12.968 --> 42:15.470
You must believe that.
I don't.

42:15.537 --> 42:18.973
Perhaps if you had come here two
weeks ago with this court order,

42:19.041 --> 42:21.042
you could have said something to her

42:21.109 --> 42:22.676
to convince her to go on.

42:22.744 --> 42:25.079
Sadly, you did not.

43:19.133 --> 43:22.168
St. Jude, worker of miracles,

43:22.236 --> 43:24.170
pray for us.

43:24.238 --> 43:26.006
St. Jude, worker of miracles,

43:26.074 --> 43:27.774
pray for us.

43:27.842 --> 43:30.143
St. Jude,
help for the hopeless,

43:30.211 --> 43:31.211
pray for us.

43:32.513 --> 43:33.814
Lana?

43:35.350 --> 43:37.418
Lana?

43:37.485 --> 43:39.219
I'm sorry, Lana.

43:39.287 --> 43:40.788
I hate to do this to you, but...

43:40.855 --> 43:42.222
What are you doing?

43:42.290 --> 43:45.058
I asked not to see him.

43:45.126 --> 43:46.760
I know, but he's allergic

43:46.828 --> 43:48.428
to the formula and he's been crying

43:48.496 --> 43:49.997
like this for seven straight hours.

43:50.065 --> 43:51.732
That's not my problem.

43:51.800 --> 43:54.268
I know. I just took a chance.

43:54.335 --> 43:56.369
I couldn't bear to see him suffer.

43:56.437 --> 43:58.838
I thought maybe if he suckled a bit,

43:58.906 --> 44:00.606
he might calm down.

44:00.674 --> 44:02.675
I'm sorry.

44:02.743 --> 44:04.643
It seemed worth a try.

44:08.314 --> 44:09.681
Give him here.

44:45.852 --> 44:56.624
