09:50.057 --> 09:51.489
Oh, go to hell, dana.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.692
-First of all, my brain
is faster than yours...
-All right, all right.

09:53.794 --> 09:54.859
...And dad's in charge.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.561
Dana got an investor today.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.930
Who's real.
Unlike your fantasy idea.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.499
Okay, yeah, the world's
coming out of an
economic depression

10:01.602 --> 10:03.802
-and you're putting out
a bespoke clothing line?
-[chuckles]

10:03.904 --> 10:06.271
-oh, brilliant.
-Enough! Jesus christ.

10:06.373 --> 10:09.240
You guys have been at
each other's throats since
the beginning of time.

10:09.343 --> 10:10.709
You're family.

10:10.811 --> 10:13.278
And if you haven't learned
to stick together by now,

10:13.380 --> 10:15.146
your mother... And...

10:15.248 --> 10:16.047
Uncle reggie!

10:16.149 --> 10:17.616
-Honey? Oh, my god!
-[thuds]

10:17.718 --> 10:19.618
dana, call 911,
rose, get some water.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.685
Dad, wake up.

10:20.787 --> 10:21.653
-Honey, honey, please.
-Daddy.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.021
-Wake up!
-[bridgette] uncle reggie.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.623
Come on, reginald,
please, baby.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.791
-Where are they?
-Dad!

10:26.893 --> 10:28.193
-[vanessa] baby.
-[August] wake up!

10:33.033 --> 10:34.032
Dad...

10:39.139 --> 10:41.539
I keep having nightmares
his death was my fault.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.874
August, stop that.

10:43.477 --> 10:44.442
[notification chimes]

10:45.812 --> 10:47.045
kelvin?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.181
-Why's he texting me?
-Don't. He's married.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.584
Everyone comes out
of the woodwork
when someone dies.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.820
Christian, baby,
how y'all holding up?

10:56.556 --> 10:58.123
I can't even, aunt yvette.

10:58.959 --> 10:59.891
You all right?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.593
[car approaching]

11:02.663 --> 11:04.229
god is a messy woman.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.597
[car doors open]

11:05.699 --> 11:09.200
sometimes she helps
you meet your
sales quota for the month,

11:09.302 --> 11:11.636
other times,
she takes your brother
too soon.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.071
Damn.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.508
All the rivals
are out here too.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.410
Fake-ass punks.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.445
Probably trying to
dance on his grave.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.448
People been coming after
your daddy from the jump.

11:23.550 --> 11:27.118
No one could believe
a black surgeon
bought a vineyard.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.220
They were expecting him
to rip out those vines

11:29.322 --> 11:31.856
and put in a liquor store.

11:31.958 --> 11:35.860
That's my wig girl!
Yvette king,
making your crown sing.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.462
[chuckles]

11:40.934 --> 11:42.367
you ready to do this?

11:43.737 --> 11:44.569
[exhales]

11:49.142 --> 11:51.109
[melancholy music playing]

12:13.900 --> 12:14.833
my dad...

12:15.969 --> 12:17.268
Was a standup guy.

12:18.672 --> 12:20.538
You could count on him
to be...

12:21.875 --> 12:23.308
Predictable. [chuckles]

12:23.410 --> 12:27.479
every morning he would
put his left shoe on
before his right shoe.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.980
He'd put on some jazz

12:29.082 --> 12:31.449
and make some french roast.

12:31.551 --> 12:35.487
And even if he'd have
three surgeries that night,
he would always come home

12:35.589 --> 12:37.455
and have a glass of wine
with my mom.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.925
He didn't like surprises.

12:41.027 --> 12:43.128
He loved his routine.

12:43.230 --> 12:47.031
Every day he would make us
go outside and take naps.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.234
This would annoy us.

12:49.336 --> 12:50.835
Thought it was
a waste of time.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.138
But he thought
all black folk ever did...

12:53.774 --> 12:55.573
Was work,

12:55.675 --> 12:57.842
and that the greatest gift
he could give us

12:59.012 --> 13:00.111
<i> was time to dream.</i>

13:01.381 --> 13:03.181
<i>I hope he's up there right now</i>

13:03.283 --> 13:05.150
<i> having a glass of wine,</i>

13:05.252 --> 13:07.318
<i> knowing he gave us</i>
<i> the blueprint</i>

13:07.420 --> 13:08.853
<i> on how to live.</i>

13:10.457 --> 13:12.090
<i> We love you, daddy.</i>

13:15.562 --> 13:17.862
I love rich black folks.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.198
-[chuckles softly]
-especially really rich
black folks.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.667
What do you think
the slaves are saying?

13:22.769 --> 13:25.403
-They're dead, auntie.
-Bull to the shit.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.605
We got people all around.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.341
You know
what I'm saying, bridgette?

13:30.443 --> 13:33.011
Experience, okay? Ancestors.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.646
-Mm.
-[snaps fingers]

13:34.748 --> 13:37.982
ah, yeah, my dad died
in a car accident, so I
never got to meet him, but...

13:38.885 --> 13:40.985
-I still feel him.
-See?

13:41.087 --> 13:42.987
Earth, wind and fire
knows what's up.

13:44.825 --> 13:46.724
I think, tomorrow, once
the riff-raff piece is out,

13:46.827 --> 13:49.594
we should have
a meeting to discuss
house of kings' operations.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.663
Okay, who put
salty king george in-charge?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.465
He is a harvard and wharton
business grad.

13:54.568 --> 13:57.635
You always cloud chasing.
What are you, his hype man?

13:57.737 --> 13:59.003
Wouldn't have it
any other way.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.873
She's my wife.
She's got my back

14:03.844 --> 14:06.144
okay, we'll have
a family meeting.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.816
Don't let him
hijack the throne.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.618
What throne?

14:14.621 --> 14:15.820
My dad's gone.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.427
I can't believe this.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.762
Dad and I were just in here
going over the books.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.797
I know.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.866
He was just listening
to some coltrane.

14:29.903 --> 14:30.735
[sighs]

14:30.837 --> 14:33.071
oh, you can still smell him.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.509
Where?

14:44.184 --> 14:46.150
[sniffs, exhales]

14:46.253 --> 14:48.052
god.

14:48.154 --> 14:51.122
This is crazy, right?
He's gone,
but everywhere you look,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.091
he's here.

14:54.527 --> 14:57.395
[sobs] I can't...
I can't do this right now,
I can't...

14:57.497 --> 14:58.897
We'll get through it, mom.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.131
[sobs] honey...

15:01.034 --> 15:03.067
We sacrificed everything

15:03.169 --> 15:05.670
to get this land
for the family, everything,

15:05.772 --> 15:08.273
and a built empire out of it.
So how...

15:08.375 --> 15:11.142
How are we gonna do this
without him? [sobbing]

15:13.914 --> 15:14.812
we got this, mom.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.315
[sobbing]

15:18.318 --> 15:20.852
we'll stick together. Come on.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.854
-Let's have a nightcap.
-[sobs]

15:22.956 --> 15:24.355
or maybe some edibles?

15:24.457 --> 15:25.657
I'm with that.

15:25.759 --> 15:26.791
[sobs]

15:30.030 --> 15:34.499
the stocks and bonds are
of course to be turned
over to vanessa king.

15:36.369 --> 15:40.972
Reginald has also bequeathed
each member of the family
equal shares

15:41.074 --> 15:43.241
of house of kings' wines.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.644
This includes his sister
yvette, who he also made
vp of sales,

15:46.746 --> 15:50.214
in hopes that she'll do
for the company what she did
for her wig line.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.917
Help me, jesus.
God is clearly a sister

15:53.019 --> 15:55.553
and she knows
what time of the month it is.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.189
Does she have pms and get on
everybody's nerves too?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.692
-[chuckles]
-[attorney] your father also
stipulated that rose

16:00.794 --> 16:04.662
would continue running pr
for the company as long as
you stay married to dana.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.631
And, christian,

16:06.733 --> 16:09.600
you'll continue as manager
of the bottling facility.

16:09.703 --> 16:13.338
And your father
also left funds for
your bourbon business.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.139
That's what I'm talking about!

16:15.241 --> 16:16.874
And bridgette,

16:16.977 --> 16:19.610
your uncle left you
a substantial bonus

16:19.713 --> 16:23.581
as well as a hefty raise
for your salary as manager
of the vineyard grounds.

16:23.683 --> 16:27.118
And finally, reggie believed
that leadership is essential

16:27.220 --> 16:29.520
to the house of kings'
continued growth.

16:29.622 --> 16:33.992
Reginald knew that growth
could only be obtained
by dynamic innovation.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.393
That's you, honey.

16:35.495 --> 16:39.297
That's why he saw fit
that dana, with his
financial expertise,

16:39.399 --> 16:42.734
should continue in his role
as cfo,

16:42.836 --> 16:46.738
but that August would be
president of the company.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.577
What? This is bullshit!

16:52.679 --> 16:54.312
I'm the one keeping
our books in order!

16:54.414 --> 16:56.581
Dana, we can do this together.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.050
I got us back on track.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.952
What was he thinking?

17:01.054 --> 17:03.554
August, you'll report
to the board.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.695
Auntie melanie!

17:11.331 --> 17:13.998
Hey, vanessa.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.534
I am so sorry.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.770
My flight was cancelled
coming out of burkina faso

17:18.872 --> 17:21.272
and then it took me two days
to get one out of frankfurt.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.574
It's okay, melanie.
Bridgette told me.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.243
-Hey, honey.
-Hi, mom.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.844
How y'all holding up?

17:26.946 --> 17:29.680
Okay, we're in the
middle of this will stuff.
Why don't you grab some food?

17:29.783 --> 17:30.715
We'll be out in a minute.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.984
Are you talking
about that now?

17:33.086 --> 17:36.320
I actually have
a financial matter
I need to discuss with you.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.156
Maybe we could step
into the hallway.

17:38.258 --> 17:40.658
No, whatever it is
you need to say,
you can say it here.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.127
Please, it's private, vanessa.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.996
-Mom, what's going on?
-This will just take a sec.

17:45.098 --> 17:46.330
I don't have a sec, mel.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.866
Look, we're all family here.
What is it?

17:50.136 --> 17:51.369
I loaned reggie money

17:51.471 --> 17:52.770
from my pharmaceutical
settlement.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.939
What do you mean
you loaned my husband money?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.641
-When?
-[melanie] two years ago.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.776
He owes me
ten million dollars.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.178
And I need it back.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.818
Why on earth would my husband
borrow money from you?

18:06.920 --> 18:08.986
Well, you know the last
few years were tough on him.

18:09.089 --> 18:10.588
Why didn't he go to a bank?

18:10.690 --> 18:13.391
Yeah, aunt melanie, he had
a dozen people he could have
borrowed money from.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.294
-[hesitates]
it was complicated.
-Complicated how?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.797
When was the last time
you talked to him?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.166
Two weeks ago.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.936
Wait, so you called me for
20 minutes on my birthday

18:25.038 --> 18:26.471
and at christmas, but

18:26.573 --> 18:28.306
you spoke to my husband
two weeks ago?

18:28.408 --> 18:31.008
I'm sorry, vanessa,
it was about the loan.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.311
Well, why would you
lend him money
in the first place?

18:33.413 --> 18:36.013
Reggie was turned down
by every bank out there.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.717
Between managing his
practice and this place,

18:39.819 --> 18:41.786
he was spread thin.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.888
Oh, and you didn't think
to tell me about it?

18:44.691 --> 18:46.357
I promised him I wouldn't.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.893
-Promised.
-Auntie, what's going on?

18:48.995 --> 18:51.729
-This is insane.
-Okay, I don't get this. So,

18:51.831 --> 18:53.731
you had secrets
with my husband?

18:54.234 --> 18:55.867
No. You're lying.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.836
-You always lie.
-What is that
supposed to mean?

18:58.938 --> 19:01.005
"oh, I'm a dallas cowboys
cheerleader."

19:01.107 --> 19:03.975
no, you went to cheer camp
in long beach, girl.

19:04.077 --> 19:06.477
"oh, denzel said hi to me
at the airport."

19:06.579 --> 19:08.713
no, you just passed
a poster of him.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.149
Okay, maybe I was like that
when I was 20.

19:11.251 --> 19:13.117
Things are always
foggy with you, mel.

19:13.219 --> 19:16.187
When bridgette's dad died,
you wouldn't let any of us
go to the funeral.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.556
Shit... We never even
got to meet the man.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.792
-Let's not sweat out
our edges.
-He was a musician, right?

19:21.895 --> 19:23.928
Uh, no, he was a... Painter.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.031
-Or a sculptor.
-I am not lying.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.333
I promised reggie
I wouldn't say anything.

19:29.435 --> 19:31.169
-About what?
-The money.

19:31.271 --> 19:33.337
-Vanessa...
-No.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.607
I don't believe you, melanie.

19:36.709 --> 19:39.076
-What else were you guys
talking about?
-You know what?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.678
I shouldn't have
brought this up.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.713
Oh, reggie certainly wouldn't
have cared who you were
screwing in africa.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.550
You know what,
forget it, vanessa,
let's not do this right now.

19:45.652 --> 19:49.120
Do what?
You're the one having
clandestine conversations

19:49.222 --> 19:52.123
-with my husband.
-Because we had something,
vanessa.

19:52.225 --> 19:55.159
-What? What could you
possibly have?
-We had a baby.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.029
She's sitting
right in front of you.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.497
Mom, what are you saying?

20:01.467 --> 20:03.301
Reggie is your father, honey.

20:04.137 --> 20:06.304
Look at her.
She looks just like him.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.047
You lying wonder.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.716
-Get out.
Get out of my house, now.
-Fine.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.721
I have a lawyer
at stein and becker,
I'll have him call you.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.390
[footsteps receding]

20:29.095 --> 20:31.662
-[melanie] bridgette! Bridge!
-[door slams]

20:32.865 --> 20:35.399
honey, let me explain.

20:35.501 --> 20:36.367
Bridgette. Bridgette.
[sobbing]

20:36.469 --> 20:38.569
you told me my dad
died in the accident.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.571
You took me to a grave
every July.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.441
-I know, I'm sorry, babe.
-Why did you lie?

20:43.543 --> 20:45.776
Because I promised
not to hurt vanessa.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.112
And, honey, I wanted you
to have a good life.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.514
Reggie and I happened
a long time ago.

20:50.617 --> 20:54.452
We were gonna tell you
eventually. I just
needed them to pay me back.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.053
That's nearly all we have.

20:56.155 --> 20:59.423
We? I don't care
about the money.
They're my family.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.293
What if they settle the estate
and there's nothing left?

21:02.395 --> 21:04.862
-You know how my sister is.
-[car door slams]

21:04.964 --> 21:07.531
-bridge.
-[engine starts]

21:12.138 --> 21:13.838
[August]<i> I can't</i>
<i> believe this mess.</i>

21:13.940 --> 21:17.041
Cousin bridgette
is our sister.

21:17.143 --> 21:20.745
-I... I gotta call her.
-Oh, hello no. She's probably
boxing her mom right now.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.446
No wonder dad treated her
like a king.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.582
-She is a king.
-This is crazy.

21:24.684 --> 21:27.318
You're about to have
a lot on your hands.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.520
Mom and dad were everything.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.589
-I mean, we thought
they were perfect.
-They were perfect.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.358
We can't let this
one thing change that.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.729
I saw him crying one day.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.931
Dad? Crying?

21:41.034 --> 21:44.769
And I asked him what was up
but he wouldn't tell me.

21:44.871 --> 21:48.306
Look, let's just see
if she really did
loan him those stacks.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.974
You know, dad did look
worried lately.

21:50.076 --> 21:53.044
And now, we're about to have
lawyers all up in our mix.

21:53.846 --> 21:57.848
-Oh, shit.
-Wh... What?

21:57.950 --> 22:00.318
Oh-ho... What was the name
of that firm melanie said
her lawyer was at?

22:00.420 --> 22:03.387
It was stein and...
Something, why?

22:05.191 --> 22:06.290
Oh, hell no.

22:06.392 --> 22:08.893
-He's representing her?
-Your high school fiance?

22:08.995 --> 22:11.796
We were not engaged.
Just... Serious.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.464
Very serious.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.832
Kelvin's been texting me
all week,

22:14.934 --> 22:16.867
I thought he was
offering condolences.

22:16.969 --> 22:18.269
You better connect with him.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.471
We gotta figure this out.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.983
[footsteps approaching]

22:33.786 --> 22:35.119
yvette,

22:35.221 --> 22:36.987
did you know
your brother slept with her?

22:37.090 --> 22:39.457
Of course not, vanessa.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.192
Yvette, don't lie to me.

22:41.294 --> 22:44.295
You two kiki twice a week,
you practically invented
the zoom call.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.697
Vanessa, sweetie, come on.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.432
I'm sure it was a mistake.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.668
You were reginald's life.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.603
Really? 'cause it
sure doesn't feel that way.

22:56.642 --> 22:59.744
Mom, can we at least
talk about August
becoming president?

22:59.846 --> 23:02.380
-Honey...
-I've been the cfo.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.648
Dana, I don't have
time for this right now.

23:04.751 --> 23:08.285
Did you know your father
borrowed 10 million dollars
from my sister?

23:08.388 --> 23:10.388
No, if dad was having
financial problems,
he cooked the books

23:10.490 --> 23:11.589
so I wouldn't catch it.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.191
Well, why the hell not?
The money's your job.

23:14.293 --> 23:16.694
That's why August
got promoted.

23:16.796 --> 23:19.163
That's not fair.
This is not my fault.

23:19.265 --> 23:20.498
I'm not gonna own this.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.567
[grunts in frustration]

23:26.906 --> 23:28.105
[sniffles]

23:31.511 --> 23:32.977
[sobbing softly]

23:39.419 --> 23:43.287
mom, you gotta stop.
You don't...
You don't eat like this.

23:43.389 --> 23:44.655
No.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.625
I used to, when I was on tv.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.597
Shove it all down my throat,
and then throw it up
before I went on.

23:53.699 --> 23:55.833
I gave up my whole career
for your father.

23:56.702 --> 23:58.669
I could have been
joy reid by now.

23:58.771 --> 24:01.105
Please tell me
you found something, August.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.707
Why did he have to
borrow money from her?

24:03.810 --> 24:06.076
I don't know. You know,

24:06.179 --> 24:08.312
it costs a lot of money
to run this place.

24:08.414 --> 24:09.947
The fermentation tanks,

24:10.049 --> 24:11.782
the land, the fires,

24:11.884 --> 24:14.485
the pandemic,
six different wines.

24:14.587 --> 24:16.687
And bridgette!

24:16.789 --> 24:20.424
I love her. She's my niece,
but you get that I can't
have her back here.

24:21.194 --> 24:22.693
She's like my sister, mom.

24:22.795 --> 24:26.096
She's my husband's
illegitimate child,
who I bathed,

24:26.199 --> 24:28.766
bought gifts for
and then took her
on vacation, August,

24:28.868 --> 24:30.568
and they were
laughing behind my back.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.736
Bridgette's a bystander
in this.

24:32.839 --> 24:36.173
She grows our grapes,
she knows our soil,
we can't just fire her.

24:36.275 --> 24:37.875
She's making a fool of me.

24:40.012 --> 24:43.113
Your father thought that
you could run this place.

24:43.216 --> 24:45.516
As president
of house of kings,

24:45.618 --> 24:48.219
find a way to pay
my sister back.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.824
[song playing
over speakers]

24:57.663 --> 24:59.063
-hey.
-Hey.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.631
Hm, um...

25:00.733 --> 25:03.934
-Really? Come here.
-[both chuckle]

25:04.036 --> 25:06.003
by the way, I'm so sorry
to hear about your dad.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.304
You know how much
he meant to me.

25:07.406 --> 25:09.073
-I know I didn't make
it to the funeral, so...
-It's okay.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.208
-It's all right. Thank you.
-Well, let's sit down.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.209
Yes.

25:14.647 --> 25:16.113
-[bartender] welcome, sir.
-Hi.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.249
So, how are you?

25:19.252 --> 25:20.217
-Good.
-Yeah?

25:20.319 --> 25:21.719
Yeah.

25:21.821 --> 25:22.987
-You look great.
-[drink pouring]

25:23.089 --> 25:24.522
so does this place.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.556
Thank you.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.391
Look, I got your message.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.693
Still leaving those
eight-minute jammies
on a phone?

25:29.795 --> 25:30.728
[chuckles] I had no choice.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.530
This was
a conflict of interest.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.665
Oh, well, we broke up
senior year.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.867
Okay, well you do
criminal law.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.002
Amongst other things.

25:38.471 --> 25:39.503
[chuckles]

25:40.540 --> 25:42.673
look, your aunt's
repped by my firm.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.108
That's why I was
hitting you up.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.076
-Hm.
-Bridgette and I were
homies too, back then.

25:47.780 --> 25:48.879
I know this is a lot.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.514
Yeah. [exhales]

25:50.616 --> 25:52.016
I mean, this
ten-million-dollar loan,

25:52.919 --> 25:54.485
it could destroy us right now.

25:54.587 --> 25:57.388
-I know.
-Why can't we pay aunt melanie
back in installments?

25:57.490 --> 25:59.790
Well, melanie feels
with dana in charge
of the books

25:59.892 --> 26:03.427
and your mom in his ear,
monthly payments could get
lowkey shady.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.362
You know, I'm trying to
liquidate a few assets,

26:05.464 --> 26:06.864
but can you ask her?

26:07.300 --> 26:08.432
Yeah.

26:10.436 --> 26:12.436
So, what happened
to new york? I...

26:12.538 --> 26:14.471
-I thought
it was your calling.
-Hm.

26:15.207 --> 26:17.341
-I got a better gig.
-Mm-hmm.

26:17.443 --> 26:18.642
I've been back three years.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.178
Oh, wow!

26:22.048 --> 26:24.214
-Okay.
-[both chuckle]

26:26.552 --> 26:29.753
listen, your mom
will get over this.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.355
She's in her feelings now.

26:31.457 --> 26:36.126
And your dad, he could have
left at any time if he felt
he made a mistake.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.828
You all were what was
important to him.

26:39.498 --> 26:40.564
Yeah.

26:54.747 --> 26:55.512
Hey, girl.

26:55.615 --> 26:57.648
Oh, momma... Mm...

27:01.053 --> 27:02.820
What were you
thinking, melanie?

27:02.922 --> 27:04.822
Just rolling up in there,
talking out your neck?

27:04.924 --> 27:07.391
She kept pushing
and pushing, yvette.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.194
You were supposed to
take that to your grave,
not spill all the tea.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.796
That was two pots
and a thermos full. Shoot.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.465
I burnt my lip
just hearing you.

27:14.567 --> 27:16.767
Look, I wanted to come
and support my sister.

27:16.869 --> 27:19.436
But I knew at some point
we were going to have to
talk about this.

27:19.538 --> 27:22.673
Every time I asked reggie
when he was gonna give me
my money, he kept saying

27:22.775 --> 27:25.943
-next month.
-How's bridgette taking it?

27:26.846 --> 27:28.412
Gosh, she hates me.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.381
[sighs]

27:30.483 --> 27:33.517
I was gonna tell her
about everything, but...

27:33.619 --> 27:35.052
I can't now.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.588
She doesn't get how hard
this has been.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.890
I've wanted to come clean
for years, but...

27:40.426 --> 27:41.825
Reggie put that off too.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.896
You gotta make sure
August does right by me.

27:45.998 --> 27:49.233
Girl, I told you ages ago
to let that go.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.768
Men are clear.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.670
If they want you,
they'll move
the world for you,

27:52.772 --> 27:55.506
if they don't, they'll walk
all over you like a doormat.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.875
You remember leeroy, my ex?

27:58.344 --> 27:59.910
Yeah, the plumber.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.412
-Hm.
-He was so funny.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.180
He could play some spades.

28:03.282 --> 28:05.883
Every year, he said
he was gonna commit,

28:05.985 --> 28:07.084
put a ring on it.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.520
But online gambling
had his heart.

28:09.622 --> 28:11.088
Hm.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.191
Now, he's in a homeless
shelter, praying he'll win
the lottery, so he can

28:14.293 --> 28:15.659
piss that away too.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.095
I loved him.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.997
My brother loved vanessa

28:20.099 --> 28:22.933
the same way leeroy loved
online gambling.

28:23.869 --> 28:27.004
So now, I'm switzerland.

28:27.106 --> 28:29.306
I'm not involved in this mess.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.508
You are. You knew.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.243
So, we're all in it.

28:36.015 --> 28:36.914
[car door slams]

28:40.519 --> 28:43.253
[reading indistinctly]

28:43.355 --> 28:44.488
are you serious?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.490
You deactivated my card?
I had to come in
through the back.

28:46.592 --> 28:49.293
No, no, my mom
must've done that.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.461
I'm sorry

28:50.563 --> 28:53.097
this is crazy, right?
We're sisters.

28:53.199 --> 28:53.997
How are you holding up?

28:54.100 --> 28:56.767
I feel betrayed,
August, confused.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.136
I just wanna mute the nonsense
and get back to work

28:59.238 --> 29:01.572
but don't take the vineyard
away from me.

29:01.674 --> 29:03.240
No, no, come here.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.977
I wish none of this
was happening. Listen,

29:07.079 --> 29:09.246
I love you.
You're my best friend.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.615
Okay? But this... This is
gonna take some time.

29:11.717 --> 29:14.618
-[christian] mom, please!
-Oh, get off our property.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.553
I work here too,
aunt vanessa, remember?

29:16.655 --> 29:19.289
-Not anymore.
-Mom, come on,
let's not fight.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.558
You need me.
None of you know
how to make wine.

29:21.660 --> 29:24.461
-Christian can do the grapes.
-Oh, then you'll definitely
go down.

29:24.563 --> 29:27.231
-What's that supposed to mean?
-This isn't your love,
christian.

29:27.333 --> 29:30.167
But for me,
these grapes are everything.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.436
Besides, I'm working on
something special here.

29:32.538 --> 29:34.304
Well, thank goodness
we're in napa,

29:34.406 --> 29:37.074
there's plenty of grapes
to tend to here.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.877
Now, I will give you
a good job reference.

29:39.979 --> 29:40.944
Goodbye, bridgette.

29:43.816 --> 29:45.716
Listen, I'll talk to her
and we'll fix it.

29:45.818 --> 29:49.186
Fix it now! I'm a king.
I'm a goddamn king!

girl, there are five brothers

30:08.808 --> 30:10.507
I played "would have,
could have, should have" with.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.810
You were fiending
and grieving.

30:12.912 --> 30:15.379
I always thought I'd end up
with someone like my dad.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.315
Kelvin was the closest thing.

30:18.417 --> 30:20.818
Funny, charming. [chuckles]

30:20.920 --> 30:23.187
my dad loved him.

30:23.289 --> 30:28.025
Then he goes and marries
some basic holly-homemaker and

30:28.127 --> 30:30.327
I don't know how to sew.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.396
You make reservations.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.798
When the time's right,
you'll meet someone.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.568
I just need to figure out
a way to pay aunt melanie.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.070
You should have seen
bridgette's face. Oh...

30:40.573 --> 30:41.605
She was crushed.

30:41.707 --> 30:43.507
She loves this place
as much as I do.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.175
This will blow over.

30:45.277 --> 30:50.514
It's like my dad dropped
a bomb and we're all
left to clean up the fallout.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.583
Why would he choose me
over dana? Hm?

30:52.685 --> 30:55.319
Dana would be better
at all of this.

30:55.421 --> 30:57.688
You're a people person,
August.

30:57.790 --> 30:59.423
Just like your daddy.

30:59.525 --> 31:02.793
You were up under his wing,
learning everything.

31:02.895 --> 31:06.330
He saw your passion.
This is about legacy.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.098
But dana's right.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.567
I don't know the numbers.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.003
That's why your dad
was teaching you the books,

31:13.105 --> 31:14.738
the profit margins.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.909
You're the only one
who can bring this family
back together.

31:19.011 --> 31:22.512
Dana is a savage who would
sell all of this land
for a quick buck.

31:22.615 --> 31:23.847
Hm, that's true.

31:24.950 --> 31:26.450
How are you
holding it together?

31:27.419 --> 31:29.152
I know my brother's good.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.189
The big man's
got this handled.

31:33.659 --> 31:35.292
[clicks tongue] auntie.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.465
-Now, turn this computer off.
-Ah...

31:42.635 --> 31:44.301
Bad bitches don't look back.

31:44.403 --> 31:45.802
[chuckles]

31:47.072 --> 31:49.339
dad took a loan out
on the oaks bluff home, so,

31:49.441 --> 31:52.109
even if we sell that and
some more art at sotheby's,

31:52.211 --> 31:53.277
we're still short.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.145
We're meeting kelvin tomorrow
to present a settlement.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.247
Then cashing in stock
would be a mess.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.683
But what about
willy wonka's
bourbon distillery?

31:59.785 --> 32:01.451
Dad never really
believed in it anyway.

32:01.553 --> 32:05.389
Hey, that is my baby
and don't disrespect
a classic like that.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.190
How about the new york place?

32:07.293 --> 32:08.225
He refinanced it.

32:08.327 --> 32:10.327
Plus, I use it to court
advertising clients.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.896
Then you'll stay
at the four seasons
like the rest of us.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.933
Oh, come on, guys.

32:16.035 --> 32:20.037
I'll cut my spending.
I'll turn in my range rover.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.906
-[chuckles] oh,
now you're tripping, boo.
-[chuckles]

32:23.008 --> 32:26.109
August, you spend
$2,000 a month

32:26.211 --> 32:29.680
on pop-up restaurants
scarfing down $90-ramen
with gold-leafed caviar.

32:29.782 --> 32:33.250
Let's not forget about your
clothes budget, hair, waxing,

32:33.352 --> 32:34.451
you couldn't get your
spending in check

32:34.553 --> 32:36.753
if paul krugman
spoon-fed you directions.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.488
You know what your
problem is, dana?

32:38.590 --> 32:42.659
You just can't handle the fact
that dad wanted me to
have this and not you.

32:42.761 --> 32:45.128
Dad didn't give me the job
because he couldn't see me.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.164
Dana, you know
that's not true.

32:47.266 --> 32:50.434
-Your father saw you,
he loved you.
-No, come on.

32:50.536 --> 32:53.770
I couldn't
look him in the eye,
so he didn't see me as a man.

32:53.872 --> 32:55.772
August was
the acceptable face.

32:55.874 --> 32:59.643
Bullshit! I got his job
because I have great ideas.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.912
Because I have a vision
for this place

33:02.014 --> 33:03.814
as something greater
than a cash cow.

33:03.916 --> 33:05.849
Okay,<i> la la land.</i>

33:05.951 --> 33:09.853
I'm also the one who told dad
to buy this place.

33:09.955 --> 33:11.355
Yeah, I knew
it was a great idea.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.157
You were off
at boarding school
having thanksgiving dinner

33:14.259 --> 33:17.861
with some well-connected
white family
when I pitched this vineyard.

33:17.963 --> 33:21.598
One of my<i> la la land</i>
ideas will get us
out of all of this.

33:21.700 --> 33:22.566
Bespoke that.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.679
[footsteps receding]

33:36.382 --> 33:37.247
bitch.

33:37.916 --> 33:38.915
[scoffs]

33:39.618 --> 33:41.051
[whispers] okay.

33:42.187 --> 33:44.388
[horns honking]

33:55.768 --> 33:58.168
look, we've gone
over our accounts

33:58.270 --> 34:00.504
and we realize
our father owes a lot.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.472
But right now it's time
to reach a settlement.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.341
The number is
ten million, August.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.942
Five million.

34:06.045 --> 34:09.413
Plus, we'll let her in
on our ipo when we go
public in two years.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.815
Well, that sounds great
unless your wallstreet dreams

34:11.917 --> 34:13.683
dry up like raisins in the sun

34:13.786 --> 34:15.052
with christian on duty.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.853
Our grapes will be
plump and juicy.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.823
-Trust.
-Look, I've thought
about it.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.259
I'll take the settlement

34:22.361 --> 34:25.028
as long as bridgette
gets her job back.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.431
-We can work that out.
-Hell no.

34:27.533 --> 34:31.068
You and your offspring
will not step foot
in my home again.

34:31.170 --> 34:32.636
We are family.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.337
That's a sister sledge song.

34:34.440 --> 34:37.074
-So, you want
a court to decide?
-Bring it on.

34:37.176 --> 34:39.209
Is this really how
you wanna play this?

34:39.311 --> 34:42.646
Do you really want everyone
in napa to know that
your picture-perfect life

34:42.748 --> 34:45.048
wasn't as ideal
as you made it seem?

34:45.150 --> 34:47.684
Because that's what will
happen if we go to court.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.020
You will lose more than
just money.

34:50.122 --> 34:52.422
I know the whole book,
chapter and verse,

34:52.524 --> 34:55.892
I will spill it all.
Don't you push me.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.035
Aunt melanie has
lost her damn mind.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.938
-What does she mean
she knows the whole book?
-Oh, who cares?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.539
My sister has been
churning out fibs

35:09.641 --> 35:12.209
since she's been sporting
cornrows in second grade.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.277
Mom, she's just hurt.

35:14.379 --> 35:15.579
She's not gonna
take the settlement

35:15.681 --> 35:18.615
if bridgette doesn't get
her job back.

35:18.717 --> 35:23.253
Your mama's acting like she is
the first black person to be
backstabbed by her family.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.789
This mess goes back
to<i> othello.</i>

35:26.391 --> 35:27.491
What's your plan?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.127
I don't know.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.195
Hey, where are you going?

35:32.297 --> 35:35.799
I gotta go.
I... I gotta go think.

35:35.901 --> 35:36.933
[sighs]

35:38.837 --> 35:40.637
[soft music playing]

35:42.641 --> 35:44.508
coltrane or miles?

35:44.610 --> 35:46.643
Oh, so we're closeted
besties now?

35:46.745 --> 35:48.478
I'm surprised you drove
over here.

35:48.580 --> 35:49.613
[sighs]

35:49.715 --> 35:50.914
I didn't know
you're painting again.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.583
[sighs] if I can't work
I gotta do something.

35:53.685 --> 35:56.219
You know, christian's ass
had the nerve to facetime me?

35:56.321 --> 35:59.256
-Mm... [chuckles]
-begging me to teach him
how to harvest the grapes.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.258
He can be sometimey, but

36:01.927 --> 36:03.460
he needs your help.

36:05.998 --> 36:08.298
I think I may
have a way to fix this.

36:13.038 --> 36:14.404
-[sighs]
-our dad would kill us.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.238
[both chuckle]

36:15.340 --> 36:17.007
our dad...

36:17.109 --> 36:21.011
He was your dad.
Everyone keeps reminding me
what I really was.

36:27.486 --> 36:31.188
Yes, we're drinking
straight outta the bottle,
you shithead.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.089
[both laughing]

36:35.127 --> 36:36.126
so, what's your plan?

36:47.139 --> 36:49.172
This was a good idea.

36:49.274 --> 36:51.341
I had groesbeck make
all your favorites.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.643
My granddad loved
cooking for you.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.379
-I just wanna follow
in his footsteps.
-[vanessa] hm.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.718
So, I know you have
your reservations

37:01.820 --> 37:04.154
about me doing this job, but

37:04.256 --> 37:05.121
I want this, mom.

37:05.224 --> 37:07.357
I know I can do it,
I have a vision.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.559
Mm-hmm.

37:09.661 --> 37:12.629
True business people
are sharks, honey.

37:12.731 --> 37:15.465
Ready to go in for the kill
at any time.

37:15.567 --> 37:20.136
You know I love you.
And I want you to succeed
in running the company.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.539
But the art of surprise
is your weakness.

37:23.709 --> 37:25.642
You can't just make a pitch.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.178
You gotta get everybody
on your side first.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.947
Those business people
are cutthroat.

37:31.049 --> 37:35.018
Bam and shock 'em
just when they
least expect it.

37:35.120 --> 37:37.120
And you don't think
I can do that?

37:37.222 --> 37:39.489
-Mm...
-Oh, okay.

37:40.392 --> 37:42.826
Well, um, how's this?

37:42.928 --> 37:44.461
[footsteps approaching]

37:45.130 --> 37:46.496
oh, hell no.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.832
No. Definitely not.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.202
I'm looking at
the bottom-line, mom.

37:52.304 --> 37:54.738
It's just business.
Shock them in awe. Right?

37:56.275 --> 37:57.907
No, no, this is crazy.

37:59.211 --> 38:02.345
Check your feelings.
It's time to eat and drink.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.014
We're mending fences.

38:08.553 --> 38:10.553
I will not be part of this.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.255
I'm sorry, ma.
August is right.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.190
We gotta come together, y'all.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.427
This is wrong.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.629
-Uncalled for.
-But necessary.

38:19.731 --> 38:21.064
We're family.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.933
We can't let some messy thing
that happened 30-something
years ago

38:24.036 --> 38:25.368
ruin that.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.638
She's right, vanessa.
I'm so sorry.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.173
I should've told you.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.876
But I'll do anything
to make this up to you.

38:32.978 --> 38:35.178
Mm. I have a question.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.680
Okay, good.
Questions are good.

38:36.782 --> 38:38.014
How did this happen?

38:44.089 --> 38:46.022
Reggie had invited you
away for the weekend

38:46.692 --> 38:48.425
and you said you were sick.

38:48.527 --> 38:52.662
But you were hooking up
with that guy dennis
in los angeles.

38:52.764 --> 38:55.365
Well, reggie found out
because one of his boys

38:55.467 --> 38:57.967
was there and gave him
the 411.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.736
We were studying together and

39:00.839 --> 39:02.105
one thing led to another.

39:03.408 --> 39:05.241
But by the time you got back,

39:06.378 --> 39:09.713
you were over dennis.

39:09.815 --> 39:12.382
And reggie iced me out
so hard, when I found out

39:13.418 --> 39:14.684
I was pregnant...

39:16.154 --> 39:19.055
I had no choice
but to move on with my life.

39:19.157 --> 39:19.989
Mm.

39:21.593 --> 39:22.659
Was that the only time?

39:22.761 --> 39:23.993
Of course that was
the only time.

39:24.096 --> 39:25.161
-Yeah.
-That makes sense.

39:25.263 --> 39:27.964
Answer the goddam
question, sister.

39:28.066 --> 39:29.532
Did you sleep
with my husband again?

39:29.634 --> 39:31.935
-Vanessa...
-How about when I was
in jamaica?

39:32.037 --> 39:33.269
I was gone for a month.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.772
-Vanessa, listen...
-[vanessa] or when
I went to paris...

39:35.874 --> 39:37.240
Or when we were
in lake arrowhead

39:37.342 --> 39:39.476
and you two
had to get firewood?

39:40.545 --> 39:41.978
How about the
obama inauguration?

39:42.080 --> 39:45.348
And he drove you
back to mayflower
'cause you were too drunk?

39:46.485 --> 39:48.618
What about the congressional
black caucus fundraiser

39:48.720 --> 39:50.487
when you two got lost?

39:51.156 --> 39:52.922
Tell me the truth, melanie.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.091
[shouting] how many times
did you fuck my husband?
[slams table]

40:07.072 --> 40:09.205
August, this is between them.

40:09.307 --> 40:10.707
We can still patch this up.

40:10.809 --> 40:14.077
-I don't know.
-Mom, come on, do something.
This is your fault.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.849
August, your father isn't
who you thought he was.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.184
He has a lot of demons.

40:21.286 --> 40:23.453
-Aunt melanie...
-Watch your back, August.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.088
This isn't a game.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.424
There's a lot more to this
than you know.

40:29.961 --> 40:30.894
Come on.
