WEBVTT

00:11.344 --> 00:13.793
- I know we agreed
not to react to Liza's news--

00:13.862 --> 00:15.344
- Well, I didn't
agree to that.

00:15.413 --> 00:17.724
- But it's getting hard
to ignore the pushback.

00:17.793 --> 00:19.551
Agents are cancelling meetings.

00:19.620 --> 00:22.241
Others are showing up just to
see the 40-year-old Millennial.

00:22.310 --> 00:25.000
- 42 according
to "New York" magazine.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.206
- Well, mercifully
they have a paywall now.

00:27.275 --> 00:29.482
- And I got a call from
Infinitely 21.

00:29.551 --> 00:31.034
They want to have
another meeting

00:31.103 --> 00:33.586
to "clarify final details"
of our deal.

00:33.655 --> 00:34.862
- The clothing chain?

00:34.931 --> 00:36.068
What deal is that?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.379
- We negotiated a deal
with them

00:37.448 --> 00:39.000
to sell Millennial titles
in their stores.

00:39.068 --> 00:41.724
Potentially a major new
revenue stream.

00:41.793 --> 00:44.655
-  A 42-year-old
shilling Millennial books

00:44.724 --> 00:46.103
at Infinitely 21.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.551
That'll be a fun headline.

00:47.620 --> 00:49.241
- Maybe we have her
sit that one out?

00:49.310 --> 00:51.379
We could... rest her for a bit?

00:51.448 --> 00:53.068
- I think we need to be more
proactive.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.862
Have her reach out to our
authors directly.

00:54.931 --> 00:56.586
- I think this is crazy.

00:56.655 --> 00:59.068
She lied to you,
made you all complicit,

00:59.137 --> 01:00.896
and now it's threatening
your business.

01:00.965 --> 01:02.379
But you want to let her
get away with it,

01:02.448 --> 01:04.137
allowing her to endanger
the company.

01:04.206 --> 01:07.793
You're refusing to put out
a very preventable fire.

01:07.862 --> 01:09.413
Write her a nice recommendation

01:09.482 --> 01:11.517
and get her out before she
poisons the whole company.

01:13.068 --> 01:14.448
- Knock-knock.

01:17.137 --> 01:18.724
I pulled those comps
on baby books, so...

01:18.793 --> 01:19.896
here.

01:19.965 --> 01:21.896
- Liza, wait.

01:21.965 --> 01:23.000
Don't take this personally.

01:23.068 --> 01:24.413
- It sounded pretty personal.

01:24.482 --> 01:26.586
- It can't be.
I don't know who you are.

01:26.655 --> 01:28.137
- Zane--
- Charles.

01:28.206 --> 01:29.379
I know you love her,
but as soon as you found out,

01:29.448 --> 01:31.379
you should've reported her
to HR.

01:31.448 --> 01:34.068
Or at least told her
best friend about it.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.000
- I actually knew
before he did.

01:40.310 --> 01:42.724
- You're all insane.

01:42.793 --> 01:47.137
- Ignore him.
Millennial is going to be fine.

01:48.103 --> 01:49.931
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.137
You're killing the deal?!

01:51.206 --> 01:52.965
- Nobody said kill.

01:53.034 --> 01:55.758
We just think,
given the recent revelations,

01:55.827 --> 01:57.724
that this union isn't as...

01:57.793 --> 01:59.241
straightforward
as we thought.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.689
Does that make any sense?
- No.

02:00.758 --> 02:02.896
Because this deal was
about selling books,

02:02.965 --> 02:04.241
not about Liza.

02:04.310 --> 02:06.103
- The deal was about the brand.

02:06.172 --> 02:10.068
Our brand is fun, sexy,
authentic, youthful.

02:10.137 --> 02:12.827
And your brand now
represents faking that.

02:12.896 --> 02:14.379
The kiss of death
in any youth brand

02:14.448 --> 02:16.620
is being embraced by
an older generation.

02:16.689 --> 02:17.931
Do you know what I mean?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.620
- This is the exact kind
of discrimination

02:19.689 --> 02:22.241
that drove Liza to do this
in the first place.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.517
- And she can wear
all the rompers she wants.

02:24.586 --> 02:27.517
We just don't think this is
a smart partnership

02:27.586 --> 02:29.482
for us anymore.

02:29.551 --> 02:32.551
And that is the tea.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.103
- Well, uh, you want
some tea, Shelly?

02:36.172 --> 02:39.275
Everyone is pretending
to be younger.

02:39.344 --> 02:41.448
We dye our hair,
we whiten our teeth,

02:41.517 --> 02:43.241
we wear moisturizing face masks

02:43.310 --> 02:44.724
that make us look like
serial killers,

02:44.793 --> 02:46.413
and we squeeze our widening
hips into Spanx

02:46.482 --> 02:48.068
because the most important
thing to be

02:48.137 --> 02:51.000
in the whole goddamn world
is 27.

02:51.068 --> 02:53.034
Should I have told the truth?
Sure.

02:53.103 --> 02:55.000
But you know what?
So should you.

02:55.068 --> 02:57.172
Millennial isn't an age.
It's an attitude.

02:57.241 --> 03:01.586
And if you can't sell that,
we'll go somewhere else.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.068
I mean, the one thing we need
more of

03:21.137 --> 03:23.206
is male perspective

this exhibit is dogshit.

I mean, it's a little needy.

And, uh--and standing
a little close.

03:39.931 --> 03:41.620

Well, how come you're not
flipping your hair

03:44.103 --> 03:45.034
like the other girls

03:45.103 --> 03:46.517
telling me I'm a genius?

03:46.586 --> 03:47.931
-  Honey,
this hair took me an hour,

03:48.000 --> 03:49.448
and I don't flip it
for anybody.

03:49.517 --> 03:52.137

- Oh, thank you.

- It's Maggie, right?
- Yeah, Maggie Amato. Hi.

03:54.827 --> 03:56.379
- So, Maggie Amato:

03:56.448 --> 03:59.586
tell me what you really
think of this piece.

03:59.655 --> 04:04.517
-  You know, it's less
layered than your earlier work.

04:04.586 --> 04:08.034
But it's stunning
and interesting and...

04:08.103 --> 04:09.310
- Sexy?

04:11.551 --> 04:14.034
I'll take that
as a yes.

04:14.103 --> 04:15.413
All right, let me do you.

04:15.482 --> 04:17.241
Show me your work;
I'll tell you what I think.

04:17.310 --> 04:18.689
- Well, I don't have any
pieces here.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.724
Most of my stuff's
at my loft.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.206
- Oh, excuse me.

04:22.275 --> 04:23.655
Thank you.

04:23.724 --> 04:25.827
All right.
Off we go to your loft then.

04:25.896 --> 04:27.724
-  You're not actually
inviting yourself

04:27.793 --> 04:28.862
to my place, are you?

04:28.931 --> 04:30.448
- Oh, well, you can invite me

04:30.517 --> 04:32.103
if it'll make you
feel more comfortable.

04:37.758 --> 04:41.482
- Mm, okay, I'm all out
of toppings.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.172
Okay, I am going
to raise you...

04:47.241 --> 04:50.862
my emergency bag
of Hazelnut Spread M&Ms.

04:50.931 --> 04:52.172
- It's half-empty.

04:52.241 --> 04:53.827
- It was an emergency
kinda day.

04:53.896 --> 04:57.034
- I'm out. I won't take your
last bag of candy, Liza.

04:57.103 --> 04:59.172
- Aw.
Thank you, Bianca.

04:59.241 --> 05:01.310
- Okay, well, I'm in.

05:01.379 --> 05:02.793
-  Rats.

05:02.862 --> 05:04.275
- God.
- Yes!

05:04.344 --> 05:06.034
I win!

05:06.103 --> 05:08.000
- I think that we've all had
enough for tonight.

05:08.068 --> 05:12.862
Why don't you two go and, uh,
pick up cupcakes for breakfast?

05:17.827 --> 05:20.172
Thank you for putting on
a brave face for the girls.

05:20.241 --> 05:21.655
- I should be thanking them.

05:21.724 --> 05:23.310
It's the first time
I've smiled all day.

05:23.379 --> 05:25.448
- It is going
to be fine.

05:27.862 --> 05:29.413
- Ugh.

05:29.482 --> 05:32.482
You should wait with the girls;
I might start crying again.

05:32.551 --> 05:34.517
Hi, Shelly, what'd I do now?

05:34.586 --> 05:36.310
- Ah! Such a firecracker.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.862
I love that.
Okay, so I talked to our CMO

05:38.931 --> 05:41.931
after your little outburst,
and...

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
we have decided to unfreeze
the partnership.

05:46.068 --> 05:48.172
- Wait, so you do want to sell
Millennial books

05:48.241 --> 05:49.655
in your stores?

05:49.724 --> 05:52.172
- Yes, and we also want
to embrace the brand

05:52.241 --> 05:53.827
the way that you have.

05:53.896 --> 05:58.655
How would you feel about being
in our spring campaign?

05:59.689 --> 06:01.206
- In it how?

06:01.275 --> 06:02.586
- In a miniskirt.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.724
Or a jumpsuit.
We're still debating.

06:04.793 --> 06:07.068
What you screamed at me
today--

06:07.137 --> 06:10.241
justifiably,
we're still friends, promise--

06:10.310 --> 06:11.586
it resonated.

06:11.655 --> 06:14.482
Why should we narrowcast
our brand?

06:14.551 --> 06:18.310
We want you to be the face--

06:18.379 --> 06:21.586
and legs--of Infinitely 21.

06:21.655 --> 06:23.344
- Uh...

06:23.413 --> 06:24.827
I don't know what to say.

06:24.896 --> 06:27.034
- Say yes.
I lobbied hard for this.

06:27.103 --> 06:29.103
- Uh...

06:29.172 --> 06:30.172
okay?

06:30.241 --> 06:31.379
- Fantastic!

06:31.448 --> 06:32.379

06:54.724 --> 06:57.310
- If you knew,
then why did you come?

06:57.379 --> 06:59.689
- I came because I met
a stunning woman

06:59.758 --> 07:02.896
who wasn't afraid
to tell me the truth.

07:03.862 --> 07:05.931
I wanted to get to know her
better.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.620
Why did you let me in?

07:08.758 --> 07:11.137
Because you're an artist.

07:11.206 --> 07:12.344
Because you're curious.

07:12.413 --> 07:15.310
You're an explorer.

07:15.379 --> 07:16.551
Have you been with men?

07:16.620 --> 07:18.724
- A few times in my 20s.

08:05.655 --> 08:07.620
Haven't you ever had
a talent crush?

08:07.689 --> 08:09.379
- Not a big enough one
to defect.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.275
- Well, every ten years or so,

08:11.344 --> 08:13.137
I run into the path
of a penis.

a good idea,

08:20.931 --> 08:22.241
you know, to sample.

08:22.310 --> 08:23.517
Ugh, he's so into me.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.517
- Are you gonna
sleep with him again?

09:27.448 --> 09:28.758
- You look gorgeous.

09:28.827 --> 09:30.896
You are literally aging
backwards.

09:30.965 --> 09:32.413
- Yeah, yeah, and we got kills
for the ones

09:32.482 --> 09:33.827
where you look like
a drag queen.

09:33.896 --> 09:36.103
- Let's take five.
- Oh, that's five!

09:36.172 --> 09:38.241
We'll be back in five!

09:38.310 --> 09:40.310
- Hi.
- You look, um...

09:40.379 --> 09:42.172
- Silly.
- Uh, youthful.

09:42.241 --> 09:45.344
I think Bianca has this onesie.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.310
- Mm.

09:53.379 --> 09:55.137
I'm sorry, is the theme
of this photo shoot

09:55.206 --> 09:56.275
"Daddy-Daughter dance"?

09:56.344 --> 09:57.379
-  That doesn't count

09:57.448 --> 09:59.068
against our kills, okay?

10:03.586 --> 10:05.206
- Who told you this was
a good idea?

10:05.275 --> 10:07.724
- Quinn.
- That's right, it was me.

10:07.793 --> 10:10.172
- Hi. Shouldn't you be running
your Senate race?

10:10.241 --> 10:11.793
- It's going very well.

10:11.862 --> 10:14.206
I was just in town milking my
Manhattan fundraisers,

10:14.275 --> 10:15.862
and I got a call from our board

10:15.931 --> 10:17.620
saying our most polarizing
employee

10:17.689 --> 10:19.586
is in an ad campaign.

10:19.655 --> 10:22.275
I am so glad you decided
to do this, Liza.

10:22.344 --> 10:26.620
- Really? You weren't super
glad when you told me not to.

10:26.689 --> 10:28.758
And the publishing reaction
has been--

10:28.827 --> 10:30.172
- You know the good news about
the publishing reaction?

10:30.241 --> 10:32.793
Eight blocks outside
of Midtown, nobody cares.

10:32.862 --> 10:36.310
That is why we need
to amplify this.

10:36.379 --> 10:38.517
Okay, this is a good start,
but...

10:38.586 --> 10:40.586
you need some louder
voices of praise

10:40.655 --> 10:43.758
to drown out all that whining
from your peers.

10:43.827 --> 10:45.448
- What do you have in mind?

10:45.517 --> 10:47.000
- New York 1 is doing a series

10:47.068 --> 10:49.517
on corporate discrimination.
And I think--

10:49.586 --> 10:51.344
- New York 1
wants to interview me?

10:51.413 --> 10:53.896
- No.
They have no idea who you are.

10:53.965 --> 10:57.000
They reached out to me to do
a piece on corporate ageism,

10:57.068 --> 10:59.482
but I'm too young to have
ever experienced it.

10:59.551 --> 11:01.172
However, you could use
some press

11:01.241 --> 11:03.586
that doesn't paint you
like a Gen-X Grifter.

11:03.655 --> 11:06.172
- And you could use a prop
to boost your campaign.

11:06.241 --> 11:07.551
Besides those glasses.

11:07.620 --> 11:09.931
- These have poll-tested
through the roof.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.862
It turns out voters
are way less intimidated

11:11.931 --> 11:14.068
by a brainy woman
than a beautiful one.

11:14.137 --> 11:16.275
- How does New York news
help your race in California?

11:16.344 --> 11:17.655
- It's 2019.

11:17.724 --> 11:18.931
All news is national news

11:19.000 --> 11:20.482
if you have the right
algorithm.

11:20.551 --> 11:21.965
- And the board is okay
with this?

11:22.034 --> 11:23.241
- You know what? You're right.
Let me check.

11:23.310 --> 11:24.586
They love it.

11:24.655 --> 11:26.000
New York 1's gonna
reach out to you.

11:26.068 --> 11:28.517
Oh, this is a real one.

11:28.586 --> 11:30.310
- ♪ When a storm comes up ♪

11:30.379 --> 11:31.758

11:40.379 --> 11:41.758
- Hi.

11:41.827 --> 11:44.172
I've come to cook you
a peace offering.

11:44.241 --> 11:45.724
- You're gonna cook?

11:45.793 --> 11:47.896
Do you know what
a peace offering is?

11:53.310 --> 11:55.689
- I remember what it was like
to find out someone

11:55.758 --> 11:57.068
was lying to my face.

11:57.137 --> 12:01.793
And I was angry and hurt
for way too long.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.689
- I'm fine. I'm just--

12:03.758 --> 12:05.862
- You're pissed.
Just say it.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.206
You can be such
a man sometimes.

12:09.275 --> 12:11.206
- Sometimes, okay.

12:11.275 --> 12:12.655
You are really bad at this.

12:12.724 --> 12:15.275
- This meal kit takes
40 minutes to make.

12:15.344 --> 12:16.758
I'm gonna set a timer.

12:16.827 --> 12:19.137
And you can ask me
anything you want,

12:19.206 --> 12:21.551
and I have to answer honestly.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.137
Alexa, how many tablespoons
in one ounce?

12:29.206 --> 12:32.517
- One fluid ounce
is two tablespoons.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.172
- Wait... fluid?

12:35.241 --> 12:37.517
- I'll cook, you answer.

12:37.586 --> 12:39.310
- Thank God.

12:45.137 --> 12:48.137
- So, this is the last shot
of the night.

12:48.206 --> 12:50.379
I'm gonna grab a Diet Coke.
You want?

12:50.448 --> 12:52.896
- Think she's gonna need
something stronger than that.

12:52.965 --> 12:55.551
- Josh, what are you
doing here?

12:55.620 --> 12:57.896
- Uh, you mean at your
modeling shoot?

12:57.965 --> 12:59.413
- Oh, stop.
I'm not a model.

12:59.482 --> 13:00.896
- Well--
- This isn't real.

13:00.965 --> 13:03.448
- I had to sign like three
forms just to get in here.

13:03.517 --> 13:06.482
This is legit.
You are a model.

13:09.931 --> 13:11.724
Oh, Josh, this is Shelly--
- Rozansky.

13:11.793 --> 13:13.965
Infinitely 21.
Branded partnerships.

13:15.068 --> 13:17.137
And who is Josh?

13:17.206 --> 13:19.137
- Josh is patient zero
for all of this.

13:19.206 --> 13:20.655
He thought I was his age.

13:20.724 --> 13:23.758
- Ah, well, I said
about the same age.

13:23.827 --> 13:26.310
You know, all she had to do
was correct me.

13:26.379 --> 13:28.172
- Would you correct him?

13:29.758 --> 13:32.172
So, how did this happen, Josh?

13:32.241 --> 13:34.310
-  Well, um...

13:34.379 --> 13:37.551
she wasn't all done up
like this.

13:37.620 --> 13:38.931
She was dressed way down,

13:39.000 --> 13:42.068
and she wasn't really trying
to impress anyone.

13:42.137 --> 13:43.758
She didn't have to.

13:43.827 --> 13:47.965
She was smart and...

13:48.034 --> 13:49.172
sexy.

13:49.241 --> 13:51.586
I would've believed
anything that she said.

13:51.655 --> 13:54.172
I just wanted
to keep talking to her.

13:54.241 --> 13:56.758
- Plus I was wasted.

13:56.827 --> 13:58.758
Right? And it was, like,
really dark.

13:58.827 --> 14:00.551
- You liar.
- Oh yeah, really?

14:00.620 --> 14:01.551
I'm the liar?

14:04.000 --> 14:06.827
- Well, I still think
y'all are insane.

14:06.896 --> 14:08.655
And reckless.
And bad liars.

14:08.724 --> 14:11.275
But the wolf was at the door.

14:11.344 --> 14:13.137
You did what you had to do.

14:15.862 --> 14:17.931
- We even finished early.

14:18.000 --> 14:20.931
- As long as I got
more time on the clock,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
I got one more thing
I want to ask.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.758
What did you really think

14:26.827 --> 14:29.344
when I said I love you?

14:29.413 --> 14:31.862
- You didn't say that.

14:31.931 --> 14:34.620
You said you
"were in love with me."

14:34.689 --> 14:36.034
Past tense.

14:36.103 --> 14:38.620
- You still can't be honest
with me.

14:38.689 --> 14:41.137
- I was mad at you. That was...

14:41.206 --> 14:44.793
a shitty and manipulative thing
for you say to me.

14:44.862 --> 14:47.206
But I was not myself too.

14:50.241 --> 14:54.379
Maybe if we were just tougher
and told each other the truth

14:54.448 --> 14:56.758
about how we really felt,

14:56.827 --> 15:01.206
then we wouldn't have wasted so
much time and energy denying--

15:04.344 --> 15:06.482
- Looks like you're
off the hook.

15:14.448 --> 15:17.862
- Denying that I felt...

15:17.931 --> 15:21.034
I feel the same way.

15:22.448 --> 15:24.241
Present tense.

15:25.586 --> 15:26.517
Now.

15:29.758 --> 15:31.275
- Mm, mm.

15:31.344 --> 15:33.241
That timer's for food.

15:38.379 --> 15:39.758
- I love you,

15:39.827 --> 15:42.310
but stay out of my kitchen.

15:49.551 --> 15:51.103
- You must be Liza.
Pat Kiernan.

15:51.172 --> 15:53.482
- Hi, I have my coffee with you
almost every single morning.

15:53.551 --> 15:55.103
It is so nice to meet you.

15:55.172 --> 15:56.896
- It's nice to meet you.
This is an unbelievable story.

15:56.965 --> 15:58.586
I can't stop thinking
about it,

15:58.655 --> 16:00.275
How'd you keep it a secret
for so long?

16:00.344 --> 16:02.655
- I don't know, I was just
trying not to let other people

16:02.724 --> 16:04.896
find out so that they would
have to keep the secret too.

16:04.965 --> 16:06.275
- So nobody knew?

16:06.344 --> 16:08.896
- A couple people did.
Some were really upset.

16:08.965 --> 16:11.241
Some tried to blackmail me.
- Wow.

16:11.310 --> 16:13.103
- Most people agreed
that I should keep quiet.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.172
To her credit,
Quinn was one of the few people

16:15.241 --> 16:17.137
who encouraged me to tell
the truth right away.

16:17.206 --> 16:21.413
- Based on her book, I wouldn't
have thought she'd be so...

16:21.482 --> 16:22.827
empathetic.

16:22.896 --> 16:24.448
- It was before she
even really knew me.

16:24.517 --> 16:25.862
She wasn't even
an investor yet.

16:25.931 --> 16:27.655
- Oh.
- So sorry I'm late.

16:27.724 --> 16:29.724
My fundraiser was delayed
by 30 minutes.

16:29.793 --> 16:33.241
We had to find a strong enough
table for Beto to stand on.

16:34.275 --> 16:36.310
Ready?

16:36.379 --> 16:37.655
You know, I think this story's
gonna resonate

16:37.724 --> 16:38.758
with a lot of American women

16:38.827 --> 16:40.172
who sublimated themselves

16:40.241 --> 16:42.827
and their careers
in service of their families.

16:42.896 --> 16:44.620
Then when they finally got
to the door of opportunity,

16:44.689 --> 16:45.655
it was slammed
in their faces

16:45.724 --> 16:47.068
because they were too old.

16:47.137 --> 16:49.344
- Liza, you--
- But she had to deal with

16:49.413 --> 16:53.172
institutionalized sexism
and rampant ageism

16:53.241 --> 16:54.344
simply to get the job.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.965
Now, the work she's done since

16:56.034 --> 16:58.413
proves that she's always
deserved to be there,

16:58.482 --> 17:00.655
but you know, if she hadn't
broken the rules a little bit,

17:00.724 --> 17:02.344
nobody was gonna give her
a chance.

17:02.413 --> 17:04.724
- That's quite a stump speech,
but technically

17:04.793 --> 17:06.206
what she did was illegal,

17:06.275 --> 17:08.000
and the company could have
been sued.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.862
- Look, when Mark Zuckerberg
"moves fast and breaks things"

17:10.931 --> 17:13.241
in order to boost revenues,
we call him a genius

17:13.310 --> 17:14.586
and an innovator.

17:14.655 --> 17:17.206
I'm sorry, but we can't offer
that same sensibility

17:17.275 --> 17:19.310
to a woman who's simply
trying to survive?

17:19.379 --> 17:20.862
I don't know.

17:20.931 --> 17:22.517
- And I hear you championed
this right out of the gate?

17:22.586 --> 17:24.206
- Oh, absolutely.

17:24.275 --> 17:26.034
I mean, when I read the article
last week in the "New Yorker,"

17:26.103 --> 17:27.965
I was shocked,
but then I realized

17:28.034 --> 17:29.931
we needed to be open
about this immediately.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.103
I run my campaign
the way I run my companies--

17:33.172 --> 17:34.862
with transparency and honesty.

17:34.931 --> 17:36.137
- That's interesting.

17:36.206 --> 17:38.517
Liza told me you knew
about this

17:38.586 --> 17:40.310
before you invested.

17:44.103 --> 17:45.689
- No.

17:45.758 --> 17:47.862
- So that's not accurate?

17:47.931 --> 17:50.034
- I don't see how
the timing is relevant

17:50.103 --> 17:53.310
when we're here discussing this
transparently and honestly.

17:53.379 --> 17:55.931
- "Honestly."
You keep using that word.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.655
- You know, Liza's not used
to being in the public eye,

17:58.724 --> 18:00.758
and I think she was
just confused

18:00.827 --> 18:03.724
when you asked her that
question off the record.

18:07.689 --> 18:08.793
- Good to see you, gorgeous.

18:08.862 --> 18:11.620
- Yeah, hi. Can we--
- Rafael!

18:11.689 --> 18:12.862
I thought that was you.

18:12.931 --> 18:14.000
- Cassandra.

18:14.068 --> 18:15.586
both: Mwah, mwah.

18:15.655 --> 18:19.517
Cassandra Vincent, this is--
- Maggie Amato.

18:19.586 --> 18:23.586
Pleasure. You certainly
have a type, don't you?

18:23.655 --> 18:25.448
Enjoy your evening.

18:25.517 --> 18:27.896
- What was that about?

18:27.965 --> 18:29.862
- You know art critics.

18:29.931 --> 18:31.310
Always like torturing someone.

18:31.379 --> 18:34.310
Sit. I ordered a cava.
- I can't stay.

18:34.379 --> 18:35.965
I just came to tell you
something.

18:36.034 --> 18:39.482
I find you charming, handsome,
and talented.

18:39.551 --> 18:42.862
But, you know, I think my
preferences are really fixed.

18:42.931 --> 18:45.000
- They seemed pretty flexible
the other night.

18:45.068 --> 18:48.241
- I'm gay. I promise you.
Like, turbo gay.

18:48.310 --> 18:50.551
- Why don't we
enjoy our drink,

18:50.620 --> 18:52.103
have a wonderful dinner,

18:52.172 --> 18:54.724
and then you can come
back to my loft.

18:54.793 --> 18:56.482
You'll change your mind.

18:56.551 --> 18:57.586
You all do.

18:57.655 --> 18:58.965
- "You all"?

18:59.034 --> 19:01.827
What are you talking about?

19:01.896 --> 19:05.724
- What can I say?
I'm a flipper.

19:05.793 --> 19:07.000
- Excuse me?

19:07.068 --> 19:08.448
- I flipped you, didn't I?

19:08.517 --> 19:11.000
- Wow.

19:11.068 --> 19:13.931
Well, this has been a really
nice reminder.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.344
- Of what?

19:15.413 --> 19:17.793
- That sleeping with a man
isn't worth the effort

19:17.862 --> 19:20.827
of the three seconds
of mild pleasure

19:20.896 --> 19:22.793
that I could've done better
myself.

19:22.862 --> 19:26.275
- All right, you're angry now
because I speak the truth.

19:26.344 --> 19:28.517
But that was no mild pleasure.

19:28.586 --> 19:29.793
I've done this before.

19:29.862 --> 19:31.965
- Yeah, I heard.
You're a flipper.

19:32.034 --> 19:34.482
But guess what?
I'm a flipper too.

19:35.344 --> 19:36.482
- Whoa!

19:43.000 --> 19:44.689
- I came as soon as I could.

19:44.758 --> 19:46.896
So, what's the emergency?

19:46.965 --> 19:48.241
- The same as it always is.

19:48.310 --> 19:49.896
I'm sure you heard
about New York 1.

19:49.965 --> 19:51.655
- I heard that Liza
told the truth.

19:51.724 --> 19:55.000
- What you didn't hear is that
"Morning Joe" has the footage.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.517
And they're gonna show it
tomorrow,

19:56.586 --> 19:59.034
and you know what
a human centipede MSNBC is.

19:59.103 --> 20:00.344
It starts with Joe and Mika,

20:00.413 --> 20:02.310
lasts all the way
through Maddow.

20:02.379 --> 20:04.931
Leave it to Liza to turn
a local puff piece

20:05.000 --> 20:06.517
into a campaign coffin.

20:06.586 --> 20:09.310
- I'm sorry that your
publicity stunt got bungled,

20:09.379 --> 20:11.758
but I'm not really sure
what you want me to do here.

20:11.827 --> 20:14.931
- What you should have done
from the beginning: fire her.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.034
- I'm not gonna do that.

20:17.103 --> 20:19.379
- I am going to be savaged
until a head rolls.

20:19.448 --> 20:22.586
And her entire persona
is the girl who lied.

20:22.655 --> 20:25.103
- Only this time you lied.

20:25.172 --> 20:26.620
I'm not firing her for that.

20:26.689 --> 20:27.827
-  Okay,

20:27.896 --> 20:29.344
so now the truth matters.

20:29.413 --> 20:30.310
Got it.

20:30.379 --> 20:31.517
I knew that was gonna be hard

20:31.586 --> 20:33.034
for Charles to see clearly,
but you?

20:33.103 --> 20:35.655
- Charles isn't the publisher.
I am.

20:35.724 --> 20:37.482
- That's right, I forgot.

20:37.551 --> 20:39.172
Especially now that
he's back.

20:39.241 --> 20:40.275
- Please don't minimize
the strength

20:40.344 --> 20:41.793
that I bring to this meeting.

20:41.862 --> 20:42.827
- Oh, the strength that
I gave you

20:42.896 --> 20:44.206
and allowed you to keep

20:44.275 --> 20:46.172
even when you tried to derail
my campaign?

20:46.241 --> 20:47.827
- I did what I had to do
for my company.

20:47.896 --> 20:50.103
- Yeah, I respect that.
That's why I gave you a pass.

20:50.172 --> 20:53.241
And now I am asking you,
please do the same for me.

20:53.310 --> 20:56.517
- I cannot run my company
based on your negative press.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.689
Are we done here?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.413
- I guess we are.

21:07.965 --> 21:10.068
- You did the right thing.

21:10.137 --> 21:11.137
- I know that we need
her money,

21:11.206 --> 21:13.172
but she is so insulting.

21:13.241 --> 21:14.793
First she ignores our edits.

21:14.862 --> 21:17.275
Then she buys herself a spot
on the bestseller list,

21:17.344 --> 21:19.172
and now she's demanding
that we fire people?

21:19.241 --> 21:21.862
- I don't like the way
she does business either.

21:21.931 --> 21:24.103
We just need to let this
blow over,

21:24.172 --> 21:26.586
and then we can find someone
to buy her out.

21:26.655 --> 21:27.931
- Sorry to interrupt.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.448
Audrey Colbert's lawyer
just called

21:29.517 --> 21:32.413
and said that her manuscript
delivery check bounced.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.241
- Uh, probably just
an accounting error.

21:35.310 --> 21:38.344
Why don't you call
Accounts Payable?

21:38.413 --> 21:40.000
- I don't mean to alarm anyone,

21:40.068 --> 21:41.344
but I just overheard
one of the Jennifers--

21:41.413 --> 21:43.103
the sloppy one from Publicity--

21:43.172 --> 21:45.137
saying that her direct deposit
didn't go through?

21:47.827 --> 21:49.931
- She did it, didn't she?

21:50.000 --> 21:51.241
- Good morning.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.379
Is the staff meeting
in here today?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.034
What is it?

21:57.103 --> 21:59.448
- Quinn pulled her funding.

22:00.758 --> 22:02.689
We're broke.

22:08.172 --> 22:10.034
- This is all my fault.

22:10.103 --> 22:12.344
Wow, I've been saying that
a lot lately.

22:12.413 --> 22:14.448
- You keep forgetting that you
attracted Quinn to the company

22:14.517 --> 22:15.620
in the first place.

22:15.689 --> 22:16.827
- Yeah, I think she was
attracted

22:16.896 --> 22:19.034
to more than just the company.

22:19.103 --> 22:21.000
- I'm spoken for.

22:22.965 --> 22:25.172
- So now what?

22:25.241 --> 22:29.517
- So now, we meet with
all the investors

22:29.586 --> 22:31.275
that I spoke with today.

22:31.344 --> 22:33.689
-  I just can't believe
that you're doing this for me.

22:33.758 --> 22:35.275
It doesn't...

22:35.344 --> 22:38.862
- You know what's great about
the worst thing happening?

22:38.931 --> 22:42.620
There is no place to go but up.

22:42.689 --> 22:46.068
So, only good things ahead.

22:51.482 --> 22:52.827
Come on.
