WEBVTT

00:30.520 --> 00:31.360
It's good.

00:32.760 --> 00:36.800
You don't have a wife or a daughter to
worry about, you do what you want. Right?

00:38.160 --> 00:40.280
Castro, did you know the word "companion"

00:40.360 --> 00:44.840
is the Latin word for "a person
who shares his bread with others"?

00:44.920 --> 00:45.880
He loves this.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.440
Oh, no, no, no.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.640
-It's been a quirk of mine since--
-No, we all have our quirks.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.640
Thank you.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.200
Uh, thanks.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.640
Which camp were you in?

01:02.440 --> 01:05.240
Marsé was in Dachau.
And he was in Auschwitz.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.600
They branded 'em like pigs there.
Right?

01:08.680 --> 01:12.080
Truth be told,
the Nazis loved branding everything.

01:12.160 --> 01:15.120
The SS had their blood type
tattooed on their arms.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.160
Stupid German motherfuckers.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.600
-You don't look like you were in a camp.
-Because I wasn't.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.760
When they conquered Valencia,
my father had to leave.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.400
He left me there with my grandfather.

01:25.480 --> 01:28.520
I found out later that they relocated him
to "Booshenwald"

01:28.600 --> 01:30.880
-or "Bushenwald," or something.
-Buchenwald.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.440
That's where he met the Deaf Man.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.000
My father made him promise that
if anything happened to him,

01:35.080 --> 01:37.640
he would take care of me,
and the bastard kept his promise.

01:37.720 --> 01:40.120
He showed up here, what, five years ago?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.560
And he won't leave my side,
even to take a shit.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.640
I'm asking about before that.
What's your story?

01:45.720 --> 01:49.480
Look, Isabel, we're like moths.
No one knows where they come from.

01:49.560 --> 01:52.920
My family owned a pyrotechnics shop
which was opened by my great-grandfather

01:53.520 --> 01:55.320
We were in charge of the mascletá.

01:55.840 --> 01:57.960
-Do you know what a mascletá is?
-What do you do?

01:58.040 --> 02:00.360
Me? I'm a driver.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.600
-And him?
-The Deaf Man?

02:03.680 --> 02:05.440
Don't bother asking, he's mute.

02:05.520 --> 02:08.840
-Why do you call him Deaf Man?
-Deaf, mute, who cares?

02:08.920 --> 02:12.520
He's handy. He can counterfeit
anything you need. Documents, money…

02:12.600 --> 02:13.600
Perfect.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.960
-And those names?
-His tattoos?

02:16.040 --> 02:18.240
They're his friends
who died in the camp.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.520
Well, be careful, now,
because he's got a bad temper.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.080
Hey!

02:24.440 --> 02:25.360
And what do you do?

02:25.440 --> 02:27.440
I look after them.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.280
Mother Lucena, we call him.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.680
Now he'll look after you, too.

02:33.320 --> 02:37.280
-I don't need anyone to look after me.
-Isabel, everyone needs a mother.

02:37.800 --> 02:38.640
Everyone.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.440
I was raised without one.
I really don't need one now.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.720
Everyone has lost
someone they loved.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.720
Someone has to stop those bastards
from dying of old age in bed.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.880
What's so funny, Marsé?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.840
Lucena, I just came up with a little joke.

02:55.400 --> 03:00.080
Two guys in Heaven are arguing about the
concentration camp they were in, right?

03:00.160 --> 03:03.160
One in Auschwitz, like you, Lucena.
The other in Treblinka.

03:03.240 --> 03:07.080
Each is arguing his concentration camp
was much worse than the other one's camp.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.600
So, you know, God arrives
to bring calm and peace

03:09.680 --> 03:12.200
and tells them, "Gentlemen, please.
There's no need to argue now."

03:12.280 --> 03:15.400
"You're already dead.
All you have to do is rest in peace."

03:16.720 --> 03:19.440
Then one of them turns to God and says,

03:20.080 --> 03:24.360
"You don't get to have an opinion, because
you weren't in either one of those camps."

03:25.640 --> 03:28.320
You know what I mean?

03:32.960 --> 03:35.320
-That's it?
-Yeah, that's it.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.400
I don't get it. Explain it to me.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.920
Because God was never there.

03:41.800 --> 03:43.480
Okay…

03:44.200 --> 03:47.040
Comrades, we're up against
the most dangerous man in Europe.

03:47.120 --> 03:49.200
Otto Bachmann. By the end of this week,

03:49.280 --> 03:51.400
we need to have entered
his circle of trust.

03:51.480 --> 03:54.280
It's the only way to find out
how he plans to help Heim.

03:55.160 --> 03:56.000
Let's have a toast.

03:56.080 --> 03:57.640
-Come on.
-Come on, Lucena. Come on.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.240
-Come on, Lucena!
-Come on.

03:59.320 --> 04:00.200
Do it.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.080
-"We swear before the whole world…"
-We swear.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.600
"…in this public square,
this place of fascist cruelty,

04:04.680 --> 04:06.680
-that we will never give up the struggle…"
-Yes, sir.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.240
"…until the last of the guilty stand
before us and are judged by the people."

04:10.320 --> 04:12.040
Yes, sir. Amen.

04:13.360 --> 04:14.360
A NETFLIX SERIES

05:23.440 --> 05:25.720
-This car?
-We're resourceful people.

05:26.240 --> 05:27.800
-Did you steal it?
-No way, no.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.760
Stealing's a sin.
Borrowing is the Christian thing to do.

05:39.480 --> 05:44.120
EPISODE 2 - THE HOTEL

05:52.600 --> 05:54.120
Welcome to the Ritz Hotel.

05:55.160 --> 05:56.080
Madam.

05:57.080 --> 05:57.960
Sir.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.960
MONDAY 4/23 - 09:00

07:04.240 --> 07:05.160
VIENNA - IMPORT-EXPORT

07:16.000 --> 07:17.040
What's wrong?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.040
The phone is protected.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.600
I guess the bastard
doesn't even trust his own shadow.

07:26.800 --> 07:29.880
And here is a small dressing room.
I hope you like the suite, sir.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.040
It's perfect. Thank you so much.

07:36.880 --> 07:38.120
Hey, Deaf Man.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.440
-Here's the key.
-Thank you.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.160
We have half an hour before he arrives.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.000
Deaf Man!

08:01.560 --> 08:02.440
Come on.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.360
Yes, hello?

10:29.360 --> 10:30.560
Yes, who is it?

10:34.040 --> 10:35.800
I can hear you breathing.

10:37.400 --> 10:38.320
Who are you?

11:15.760 --> 11:18.000
Yes?

11:18.600 --> 11:21.720
Listen carefully.
You don't know who you're calling.

11:23.560 --> 11:25.800
Hang up the phone and forget this number.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.880
Don't call me again. Ever.

11:32.040 --> 11:33.400
Otherwise, I will find you,

11:33.480 --> 11:36.000
and I will rip your fingers off
one by one.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.240
-Well done, fellas.
-Good morning, Mrs. Bachmann.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.720
-Good morning.
-Welcome back.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.040
-Thank you.
-I'll let him know.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.240
Bachmann's phone has been tapped.
His wife just arrived. She's downstairs.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.080
Now it's your turn.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.400
Isabel, we have to go.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.200
Mom!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
My little boy!

13:49.520 --> 13:50.640
You got bigger.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.200
I swear I won't leave again.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.480
Go on, let Dad know I'm here.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.240
Off you go.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.960
The blonde woman in the blue dress
is called Ilse. She's married to Bachmann.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.680
It was a fairly uneventful trip.
But I'm glad to be here.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.320
She likes to go by the name
"Countess of Finckenstein." She's not.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.880
-She's the niece of Hjalmar Schacht--
-Hitler's Finance Minister.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.240
You aren't the only one
who knows who these people are.

15:07.800 --> 15:09.600
What name is she using nowadays?

15:09.680 --> 15:11.240
She's using hers, like Bachmann.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.360
Which gives you an idea of
how at home the couple feels in Spain.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.440
They've stopped hiding since
they have Franco's protection.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.240
Why are we going after her? Why don't we
just approach her husband directly?

15:22.320 --> 15:25.600
She's the only way to get to Bachmann.
If she tells him someone can be trusted,

15:25.680 --> 15:27.120
he'll let his guard down.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.200
The rest of the women are wives
or daughters of the regime's officers.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.280
What do you want me to do?

15:35.360 --> 15:38.160
Do you really want me
to have tea and crumpets with them?

15:38.240 --> 15:39.680
Elbows off.

15:44.520 --> 15:46.440
How do you think one attracts magpies?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.280
By leaving a shiny object in plain sight
so they can't resist.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.200
In a few hours, Ilse and her friends

15:51.280 --> 15:53.920
will go see the most fashionable couturier
in the city right now.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.480
You'll be there too.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.400
SEVEN DAYS
UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF ARIBERT HEIM

16:08.960 --> 16:11.800
Go in, let them see you,
and get out. That's it.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.320
Is that clear?

16:15.280 --> 16:16.800
-Is that clear?
-Totally clear.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.280
They have to see Pertegaz treat you like
someone important, so they think you are.

16:22.720 --> 16:26.000
Who helped you convince this so-called
Pertegaz to treat me like that?

16:26.080 --> 16:27.400
You don't need to know.

16:29.880 --> 16:33.800
Well, considering I'm the one risking
my life, I'd appreciate if you told me.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.480
Forget it.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.880
No one knows where the money
to pay for all of this comes from.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.080
You don't know either?

16:43.600 --> 16:45.960
If you don't wanna do it,
you can just leave now.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.720
One last thing.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.200
Give me your gun.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.360
I won't go in there alone and unarmed.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.680
It's just women
trying on clothes in there.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.600
I've seen women in Germany
act like the worst of men.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.160
Son of a bitch.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.520
Lucena, do you think she's ready, or what?

17:18.120 --> 17:21.080
No, Marsé. But who is ready for all this?

17:26.320 --> 17:27.840
Can I get you something to drink?

17:27.920 --> 17:30.480
-No, thank you. I'm okay.
-Please.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.680
-Mr. Pertegaz will come in a minute.
-Thank you.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.680
I really mean it.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.920
The more cleavage I can show, the better.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
I'm looking forward to this new outfit.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.240
Look at this dress. I like this one.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.680
Did you see María's dress
the other day at the party?

17:58.760 --> 17:59.600
-Yes.
-Yes!

17:59.680 --> 18:02.760
What was that?
I don't understand what she was wearing.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.240
She looked ridiculous.

18:04.840 --> 18:06.440
-Mrs. De Vega?
-I don't know what…

18:06.520 --> 18:09.440
It is a pleasure to have you in my studio.
Manuel Pertegaz.

18:09.520 --> 18:12.440
A pleasure. And thank you for seeing me.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.320
Of course, one of the most compelling
reasons to come to Madrid was to meet you.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.120
I could not refuse to see you. After all,
you come recommended by my friend.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.560
-Is this--
-Yes!

18:41.120 --> 18:43.600
I think we have company. What do we do?

18:44.200 --> 18:45.600
-Let me talk.
-Okay.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.880
-Good day to you, officer.
-Didn't you see the sign? No parking here.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.040
Sorry, officer. We're waiting for my wife.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.560
She's trying on a dress at Mr. Pertegaz's
atelier. You know what women are like.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.200
They say it'll be one minute,
and then it takes ages.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.600
Do you have any ID with you?

19:10.360 --> 19:12.400
-Mine?
-His too.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.520
Yes, of course.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.240
Here you are.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.960
Stay here.

19:36.240 --> 19:38.160
-Car registration.
-Mm-hm.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.320
Here you are.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.680
Get out of the car and open the trunk.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.280
Move it.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.600
Don't move.

20:31.080 --> 20:32.160
Let's begin.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.320
Thirty-five centimeters…

20:49.400 --> 20:51.640
My God, you're shaking. Are you okay?

20:52.560 --> 20:54.640
Yes. I'm fine.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.240
Doesn't look like it.

20:58.760 --> 20:59.600
This one.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.160
I must just be nervous to be here.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.680
Oh, you shouldn't be.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.880
Why don't you try to breathe?

21:07.960 --> 21:09.840
You're so pale.

21:16.120 --> 21:17.320
And now smile.

21:55.520 --> 21:56.360
Let's go.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.880
You were right.
They didn't take their eyes off me.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.600
We were watched as well. Let's go.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.520
What was that?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.000
I'll explain later.

22:19.640 --> 22:23.560
Listen to me. We have your ID.
We know who you are and where you live.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.680
If you tell anyone anything about us,
we will come for you and your family.

22:29.360 --> 22:30.480
Do you understand,

22:31.080 --> 22:31.960
Alejandro?

22:32.040 --> 22:34.720
We have nothing against you.
Don't force our hands.

22:34.800 --> 22:35.760
Good boy.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.360
He's seen the license plate.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.280
The Deaf Man changed 'em.

22:56.560 --> 22:57.680
How's the girl?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.640
It's too early to know yet.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.480
But?

23:03.160 --> 23:06.120
She's a… rebel. Too much of one.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.600
Rebels end up dead in the ground.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.280
-Just give her some time.
-Time? That's exactly what we don't have.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.400
She's been living alone all her life.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.200
I don;t know if she's ready
to take orders from anyone.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.640
But what we do know…

23:21.960 --> 23:24.560
is that she's good at living in disguise.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.160
MRS. CLARA STAUFFER

23:26.240 --> 23:29.320
"A masquerade organized
by the Women's Section of the Falange."

23:29.840 --> 23:32.320
-Is this a joke?
-Bachmann will be there.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.080
I've worked an angle and managed
to get you on the guest list.

23:36.680 --> 23:39.120
The party is at the home
of Pilar Primo de Rivera.

23:39.840 --> 23:42.920
Clara Stauffer organizes it every year
to raise a lot of money

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
for the Women's Section of the Falange.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.240
Stauffer, who's she?

23:47.200 --> 23:48.920
A Spaniard of German origin.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.080
A Nazi sympathizer
and militant of the Falange.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.000
You focus on Bachmann.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.920
I've seen those faces before.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.880
They could also take us
to some Godforsaken place in the country,

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
shoot us, and nobody would ever know.

24:07.040 --> 24:09.680
That's what happened
with Cristino and the rest of them.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.760
We came back to Spain to fight
with the resistance and stop Franco.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.840
We were caught, of course.

24:15.440 --> 24:18.880
I managed to escape, don't ask me how.
But my companions did not.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.880
Not even the French
Minister of the Interior

24:20.960 --> 24:24.040
could prevent them from being shot here.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.440
If only we'd stayed in Paris…

24:30.040 --> 24:32.520
Cristino would've lived there
as a hero.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.800
Heroes no longer exist, Lucena.

24:36.280 --> 24:37.320
Only the dead do.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.080
The dead do, yes.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.000
And the memory of the dead.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.720
Because Cristino is still lying
in a mass grave in Carabanchel.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.120
Cristino García was
a man who fought for the Republic,

24:49.200 --> 24:51.480
and who finished one war
just to join another in France

24:51.560 --> 24:53.280
to fight the war against fascism.

24:57.160 --> 25:00.960
I can't even remember how many times he
saved my life at the Madeleine crossing.

25:02.680 --> 25:04.920
We were no more than 30 men,

25:05.000 --> 25:09.200
and that bastard got a whole column
of the Wehrmacht to surrender to us.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.440
Almost a thousand Nazis
surrendered to the Resistance.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.400
I don't know. I'd like to think
that somebody's going to remember us.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.400
And Cristino.

25:24.000 --> 25:24.960
And the others.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.400
And Laura.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.360
Do you know why this painting is here?

25:41.600 --> 25:43.560
So that no one forgets.

25:45.080 --> 25:48.040
So that everyone, someday,
knows what they died for.

25:50.320 --> 25:52.800
They wanted the same thing
my daughter wanted.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.960
To stand against injustice
and fight for freedom.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.360
What they did to the Spaniards in Germany…

26:05.400 --> 26:07.560
that can't be forgotten, Vicente.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.240
No, but they are succeeding.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.840
Nobody knows anything about the thousands
of Spaniards who died there.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.600
Or whose fault it was
that it even happened.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.240
We don't paint pictures,

26:17.760 --> 26:20.880
but you and I can be the ones
who bring them to justice.

26:20.960 --> 26:23.440
Eichmann was also an untouchable,
and look at him.

26:23.520 --> 26:24.400
Mmm.

26:24.480 --> 26:28.760
The Nazis are starting to get scared,
and that means they'll make mistakes.

26:29.800 --> 26:32.120
You know,
fear is the worst travel companion,

26:32.200 --> 26:33.880
and they never counted on that.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.360
It has to be now.

26:37.360 --> 26:38.640
Mmm.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.240
I set myself a reasonable goal
at the time, you know?

26:43.000 --> 26:46.840
To capture these bastards,
to bring them down before they died.

26:48.080 --> 26:49.800
Now I'm aiming for something

26:50.600 --> 26:51.560
more difficult.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.960
To capture them

26:56.600 --> 26:58.000
before it's my turn to die.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.800
Oh! Your sideburns are missing.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.120
Sorry.

27:19.200 --> 27:20.440
Oh, and the scarf?

27:21.440 --> 27:23.560
Auf dem rechten Auge blind sein!

27:26.920 --> 27:29.160
It means to be blind in the right eye.

27:29.240 --> 27:32.920
It's a German saying, to criticize
the government when it turns a blind eye.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.360
Like your home is infested
and you don't call an exterminator.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.480
When you get this profound,
you're so annoying.

27:37.560 --> 27:39.280
Can someone help me, please?

27:41.480 --> 27:43.400
Here. You have to tighten it.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.080
Joan of Arc was burned at the stake.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.080
-What?
-Nothing.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.120
What did he say?

27:51.360 --> 27:53.640
That Joan of Arc was burned at the stake.

27:53.720 --> 27:57.000
-You can relax, I won't crash and burn.
-If you say so.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.760
You okay?

28:05.840 --> 28:06.720
Yes.

28:07.480 --> 28:08.360
You sure?

28:11.160 --> 28:14.640
Ilse looked me in the eyes.
They never did that when I was a child.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.400
You have to learn
to hold their gaze, Isabel.

28:22.760 --> 28:24.720
Castro, the radio!

28:27.640 --> 28:29.520
-Is it Bachmann?
-Yeah.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.760
He will meet with his lover tonight.

28:38.520 --> 28:41.800
He seems to be having
a better time than we are. Huh, Lucena?

28:41.880 --> 28:45.200
-We must be doing something wrong.
-His wife isn't gonna be happy about that.

30:02.880 --> 30:03.720
What?

30:05.080 --> 30:05.920
Nothing.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.040
I'd forgotten what it felt like.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.200
-What do we do if he doesn't show up?
-He will.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.320
You can earn twice as much
as you spend at these parties.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.360
Bachmann knows that
to defend his ideology,

30:23.440 --> 30:26.320
he's going to need these people's money.

30:31.760 --> 30:32.640
Otto!

30:34.640 --> 30:36.720
You're like a child.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.200
Darling.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.360
They're men.
They don't think with their heads.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.000
But then, they always come back.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.160
Yes, drunk, but they come back
for what they want most,

31:41.240 --> 31:42.640
which is their wives.

31:43.840 --> 31:47.320
They can never be satisfied.
It's so pathetic.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.080
Her name is Marta.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.720
They've been seeing each other for weeks,
and I don't care.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.960
He has his life and I have mine,
understand?

31:58.440 --> 32:01.400
But it's different when he flaunts it
in front of the whole world.

32:03.240 --> 32:06.200
The important thing is
that you don't forget who you are.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.240
His wife.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.760
Isabel Carán de Vega. Nice to meet you.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.840
Ilse Bachmann. Likewise.

32:36.800 --> 32:39.280
Excuse me,
I'm stealing my husband for a few minutes.

32:39.360 --> 32:42.480
She reminds me of Dietrich
in The Blue Angel. Have you seen it?

32:42.560 --> 32:44.320
Of course not. You weren't born yet.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.880
Darling, do you mind?
I want you to meet someone.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.160
What was that about?

32:53.640 --> 32:54.880
We were just talking.

32:54.960 --> 32:59.480
Keep talking if you like,
but let me know first so I can go home.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.280
What's wrong, my dear?

33:01.360 --> 33:04.440
Don't bother with jokes.
That was never your forte.

33:05.520 --> 33:06.560
Isabel?

33:08.640 --> 33:12.760
Isabel Carán de Vega
and her husband, Vicente de Vega. Otto.

33:12.840 --> 33:14.960
-Pleased to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.080
Germania?

33:20.720 --> 33:21.960
No, Joan of Arc.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.320
For a moment, you were
making me feel right at home.

33:26.400 --> 33:27.720
Have we ever met before?

33:30.360 --> 33:33.640
-No, I don't think so.
-They've just arrived in Madrid.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.880
For work?

33:35.960 --> 33:38.840
Yes, I'm thinking of settling here
and opening an office.

33:39.560 --> 33:40.600
What do you do?

33:40.680 --> 33:43.360
Little bit of everything.
Import, export…

33:45.400 --> 33:48.240
What a coincidence.
We are in the same business.

33:48.840 --> 33:51.400
But I've never heard your name before.
What was it?

33:51.480 --> 33:52.840
Vicente de Vega.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.800
de Vega…

33:56.160 --> 33:59.640
I don't know it.
And I thought I knew everyone.

34:00.480 --> 34:02.400
That's because I'm very discreet.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.600
But ask around Portugal,
around the border.

34:04.680 --> 34:05.920
That's where we operate.

34:06.520 --> 34:07.600
Hmph.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.840
Don't you find the Portuguese troublesome?

34:11.920 --> 34:13.760
You have to know
how to deal with them.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.720
I only care that the trains arrive
when they say they will.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.360
I never ask what's inside them.

34:20.720 --> 34:22.600
See, hear, and say nothing.

34:22.680 --> 34:24.160
A good rule to live by.

34:25.400 --> 34:27.400
-And where are you from?
-Austria.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.720
Also, I think we're becoming
more and more Spanish.

34:30.800 --> 34:34.000
Madrid is a city full of opportunities.

34:34.080 --> 34:37.480
And over time, you get accustomed
to the way that they live here.

34:38.160 --> 34:42.040
Well, as you can imagine, my husband likes
to have his German refuge

34:42.120 --> 34:43.840
without having to leave Madrid.

34:43.920 --> 34:46.800
-Do you know the restaurant Haus?
-Ilse, please.

34:46.880 --> 34:49.760
They told you that
they just arrived in Madrid.

34:49.840 --> 34:52.960
So what? I've been here 12 years,
and you haven't taken me.

34:53.480 --> 34:56.440
We usually meet once a year
with some fellow countrymen.

34:57.640 --> 35:00.080
It's like being back in Vienna.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.760
Of course, when you get out of there,

35:02.840 --> 35:05.600
the Manzanares is not the Danube,
but still.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.040
You've been there?

35:07.120 --> 35:09.360
-Where? To Vienna?
-No, we haven't.

35:09.960 --> 35:11.760
Well, that must be rectified.

35:12.280 --> 35:13.280
First Haus,

35:13.800 --> 35:15.840
and Vienna can come later.

35:15.920 --> 35:17.400
I'll hold you to that.

35:20.880 --> 35:21.760
Don't worry.

35:23.480 --> 35:24.360
Look at it.

35:29.400 --> 35:30.520
If you want to…

35:35.760 --> 35:37.520
Do you want to touch my scar?

35:40.440 --> 35:41.960
Otto, stop fooling around.

35:42.040 --> 35:44.960
No, no, let her do it if she wants to.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.160
Most people wouldn't dare touch me.

36:06.160 --> 36:08.160
You did it while looking me in the eyes.

36:09.160 --> 36:11.440
He loves to provoke people.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.600
-So, what do you say?
-Any night you want.

36:13.680 --> 36:15.000
We can meet for dinner.

36:16.200 --> 36:18.080
Any day? Tomorrow, maybe?

36:18.680 --> 36:21.200
It's settled.
Tomorrow's perfect. Hmm?

36:29.560 --> 36:31.040
They won't recognize you.

36:31.880 --> 36:34.840
How could they not?
I worked there for an entire year.

36:35.800 --> 36:36.840
We can't go.

36:36.920 --> 36:39.920
What if we change restaurants
at the last minute?

36:40.520 --> 36:44.160
Bachmann wants to play on his home turf.
We have to give him that advantage.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.320
Besides, you'll wear an expensive dress.

36:46.840 --> 36:49.160
If they recognize you,
they won't say anything.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.240
-Comrades?
-Hello.

37:48.360 --> 37:50.560
Good night, old man.

37:57.680 --> 37:58.640
Let me help.

38:11.400 --> 38:12.920
-Got it?
-Yeah, I think so.

38:18.760 --> 38:19.600
Thanks.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.200
Get some rest.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.640
It's funny, isn't it?

38:31.440 --> 38:33.440
In Germany, the nightmare was waking up.

38:35.360 --> 38:36.840
Here, it's falling asleep.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.800
I've found a way to do it.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.000
In the daytime.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.120
If I can hear children playing,

38:49.200 --> 38:51.200
women coming back from the market,
bells ringing,

38:52.920 --> 38:54.240
I know I'm not there.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.040
That's why I always look for night jobs.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.440
Spanish?

39:20.520 --> 39:22.040
From Zaragoza.

39:25.720 --> 39:28.680
My brother's name is Javier. Javier Riaza.

39:29.280 --> 39:32.600
If you get me more information about him,
I can get more teaspoons.

40:09.880 --> 40:10.840
Castro!

40:13.200 --> 40:15.200
Castro, it's your turn. Castro!

40:19.000 --> 40:20.160
All right.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.200
Hmm.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.600
-He should be here.
-Well, he's not.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.680
Where'd the kid go?

40:38.760 --> 40:41.000
-Deaf Man, the kid is your responsibility!
-I know!

40:41.080 --> 40:42.560
Your responsibility!

40:43.760 --> 40:45.400
Fuck.

40:50.120 --> 40:51.160
Where were you?

40:51.720 --> 40:53.920
-I went for a walk.
-Where did you go?

40:54.000 --> 40:56.360
-Don't yell at me.
-Listen to me, Castro.

40:56.440 --> 40:59.680
He's yelling because Bachmann got a call
while you were away.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.200
Now we don't know who called or why.

41:01.280 --> 41:02.800
-You're busting my balls.
-Listen!

41:02.880 --> 41:04.080
"Busting my balls"?

41:05.760 --> 41:07.680
Leave him alone!
Come on. Stop that.

41:07.760 --> 41:10.680
Where did you go? Where? Where did you go?

41:10.760 --> 41:13.560
I just went for a walk, okay? Let me go!

41:13.640 --> 41:14.520
Huh?

41:15.520 --> 41:16.720
Fuck off.

41:23.320 --> 41:25.080
"Tomorrow we'll know if it's true."

41:25.160 --> 41:27.120
-That's all?
-Yeah, that's it.

41:27.200 --> 41:29.000
That's all I was able to hear.

41:30.040 --> 41:32.320
We have
to call off the meeting.

41:33.440 --> 41:36.520
No, we can't. We may not
have been discovered. We don't know.

41:36.600 --> 41:37.960
If we back out of dinner now,

41:38.040 --> 41:40.040
that will give Bachmann
a reason to distrust us.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.160
We'll miss our chance.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.240
-Then we'll never catch Heim.
-Let's not forget who they are.

41:44.840 --> 41:48.080
What they did to us
and what they can still do to us, okay?

41:49.080 --> 41:51.800
Those people live here among us,
we see them, they smile at us.

41:51.880 --> 41:55.000
And they do it as if they have
nothing to hide. They're not afraid.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.280
They don't even hide their real names.

41:57.880 --> 42:00.440
They go on vacation, sunbathe,
they swim on our beaches.

42:00.520 --> 42:02.800
They look like normal people,
but they aren't.

42:03.440 --> 42:06.320
Just look 'em in the eyes.
They still have that darkness in there.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.840
That evil is always there.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.640
What scares me most is that…

42:12.920 --> 42:15.200
they show off their crimes
as if they were medals.

42:19.840 --> 42:20.880
I'm in.

42:22.480 --> 42:23.360
Me too.

42:27.160 --> 42:28.880
Me too, you know that.

42:38.680 --> 42:39.640
Everyone, let's go.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.200
You see anything unusual,
call this number.

43:04.280 --> 43:05.760
Okay, who do I ask for?

43:05.840 --> 43:07.440
Only call if there's trouble.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
You look great.

43:18.520 --> 43:20.400
HAUS RESTAURANT

43:30.040 --> 43:31.160
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

43:31.240 --> 43:33.920
We're here for a reservation
under Mr. Otto Bachmann.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.200
Yes, Mr. Bachmann and his wife
are already here.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.160
If you'd be so kind as to come with me.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.320
Right this way.

43:50.640 --> 43:52.320
It's so good to see you again.

43:52.400 --> 43:54.840
-Isabel, Vicente.
-Mrs. Bachmann.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.040
-You look gorgeous tonight.
-Please, just call me Ilse.

43:58.120 --> 44:00.120
You look beautiful, my dear.

44:00.800 --> 44:04.240
I think we're a little late.
I hope you'll excuse our tardiness.

44:07.320 --> 44:11.480
Otto, bitte. Do you have to be like that?
Don't pay any attention to him.

44:12.280 --> 44:16.800
After 12 years living here, we're already
familiar with your Spanish punctuality.

44:24.640 --> 44:27.760
-Bring more wine.
-Right away, Mr. Bachmann.

44:47.120 --> 44:48.960
I was an excellent swimmer.

44:49.040 --> 44:53.920
I was very good at many sports,
but swimming, that was my thing, you know?

44:54.000 --> 44:56.280
I could have made it to the Olympics.

44:56.360 --> 44:57.720
What happened?

44:57.800 --> 45:00.080
I had to choose between water and tobacco.

45:00.160 --> 45:04.120
-Which was also my thing.
-He smokes too much.

45:05.880 --> 45:09.320
And it's true that he won
some competitions in college.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.080
But going to the Olympics…

45:13.600 --> 45:15.280
You like to exaggerate.

45:15.880 --> 45:18.560
Did you play any sports
when you were young, Isabel?

45:19.280 --> 45:20.360
No.

45:21.120 --> 45:23.040
Really? I love ice skating.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.520
Well, used to.
Have you ever been ice skating?

45:25.600 --> 45:26.920
No, I don't like the cold.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.640
You get used to it.

45:29.240 --> 45:31.920
I sometimes go to the Retiro
and put on my skates.

45:32.400 --> 45:36.560
But it's not the same, you know,
because I miss the snow.

45:36.640 --> 45:38.080
No, it's not the same.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.680
Are you not hungry?

45:47.360 --> 45:48.200
No, I'm fine.

45:48.280 --> 45:50.320
Otto, I have some business
you might be interested in.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.480
Tonight isn't the night.
Maybe later.

45:52.560 --> 45:54.200
We've got to get to know each other first.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.920
Are we out of wine again?
I order another bottle.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.120
Sounds good. Why not?

45:58.200 --> 46:00.480
-We should be leaving now.
-It's early.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.960
What if we skip the wine
and order dessert?

46:03.040 --> 46:05.560
-I'm dying to try the Baumkuchen.
-It's getting late.

46:05.640 --> 46:07.680
-Come here, please.
-Yes, sir?

46:07.760 --> 46:10.480
We're going to order desserts.
Baumkuchen, right? You want to try?

46:11.080 --> 46:13.480
-That will be all. Thank you.
-Right away, sir.

46:15.920 --> 46:17.680
So, have you ever
been to Haus before?

46:17.760 --> 46:19.400
This is our first time.

46:19.480 --> 46:21.560
-We'll come back.
-Yes, do.

46:21.640 --> 46:23.120
-I like it.
-It's really good.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.240
He's never brought me.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.080
-Can you imagine?
-Excuse me.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.040
This is one
of the best Baumkuchen

46:34.120 --> 46:36.200
you can taste outside of Germany.

46:36.280 --> 46:38.720
-So, it's… How do you say?
-It's a cake.

46:38.800 --> 46:41.640
Take dessert to the Bachmanns. Thank you.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.000
Let's go. Come on!

46:54.800 --> 46:56.880
Don't talk again. Don't look at me.
You don't know me.

46:56.960 --> 46:58.760
You're gonna serve us, and that's it.

46:58.840 --> 47:01.720
Whether I'm at the table or not.
Do I need to repeat that? Do I?

47:01.800 --> 47:05.840
We're on the same side! Lucena told me
you were coming. I collaborate with him.

47:20.800 --> 47:23.560
We were afraid you were going
to miss this wonderful delight.

47:23.640 --> 47:25.920
-No. Excuse me.
-It's okay.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.720
-Everything okay?
-Perfect.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.840
Is it good?

47:32.960 --> 47:33.800
Very good.

47:33.880 --> 47:34.960
Mmm.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.400
Why don't we order another bottle of wine?

47:40.920 --> 47:42.680
Good idea, yes.

47:42.760 --> 47:43.760
Excuse me?

47:47.520 --> 47:49.560
Another bottle of wine, please.

48:06.560 --> 48:09.280
Well then,
thank you very much for everything.

48:10.360 --> 48:11.360
Good night.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.240
"Good night"? What good night?

48:14.320 --> 48:15.360
No, no. Come on.

48:16.120 --> 48:16.960
Come on?

48:17.040 --> 48:20.360
You must come with me.
I have something to show you.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.320
It's late. We should be getting home now.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.320
Isabel, speak for yourself.

48:25.920 --> 48:28.840
For us men, it's never too late. Ilse?

48:29.560 --> 48:31.720
Why don't you accompany Isabel?

48:34.880 --> 48:37.200
Don't worry, sir, that's not necessary.

48:37.280 --> 48:39.800
We should drop the formalities,
don't you think?

48:42.200 --> 48:43.920
Come on, Vicente. Get in.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.560
See you back at the hotel.
I won't be too late.
