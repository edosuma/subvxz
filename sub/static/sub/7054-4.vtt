WEBVTT

00:01.018 --> 00:02.489
You have to come back...

00:02.513 --> 00:04.147
 Previously on Fringe...

00:04.168 --> 00:06.036
because you belong with me.

00:08.348 --> 00:09.219
 Make the switch.

00:10.868 --> 00:11.707
Welcome back.

00:12.532 --> 00:13.427
Please, let me out of here.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.771
Please, let me out of here!

00:16.508 --> 00:18.180
And our Agent Dunham,
has she made contact?

00:18.403 --> 00:19.669
She's on the other side now.

00:21.365 --> 00:22.899
Walter says this tech
isn't from here.

00:23.597 --> 00:27.147
They can have an army that can
look like anyone they want them to.

00:27.683 --> 00:29.547
The shape-shifter's
blood is mercury.

00:30.588 --> 00:32.380
I have everything you
need for your new identity.

00:32.779 --> 00:36.027
Careful, their side might be alluring,
but, they started the war.

00:36.339 --> 00:37.772
I don't care how long
you've been here.

00:37.807 --> 00:40.803
This is my operation,
you work for me.

00:45.642 --> 00:48.577
So? What else
did you come up with?

00:48.645 --> 00:51.213
And you can't say pirate again.

00:53.884 --> 00:56.285
Definitely a banker.

00:56.353 --> 00:58.321
- A banker?
- Mm-hmm.

00:58.388 --> 01:00.356
- Persian Kid Rock?
- Yeah.

01:00.424 --> 01:03.359
His long hair is just
his link to his individuality.

01:03.427 --> 01:05.161
I think they work together.

01:05.227 --> 01:09.465
Well, she's wearing her
sexiest little black dress,

01:09.533 --> 01:11.000
so somewhere
deep inside of her,

01:11.068 --> 01:12.935
she was hoping this dinner
was about something else.

01:13.003 --> 01:15.037
Not work.
But she was wrong.

01:15.105 --> 01:16.505
Yes, she was.

01:17.874 --> 01:22.111
That, however,
is truly impressive.

01:26.183 --> 01:29.985
Yeah, he's a little short for her,
I'll grant you that.

01:30.053 --> 01:33.155
But not when you stand him
on his money.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.257
Careful.
Your con man's showing.

01:36.660 --> 01:40.529
I think I just understand
transactional needs.

01:40.597 --> 01:42.898
Each party has something
the other party wants.

01:42.966 --> 01:45.368
She gets security, he gets her.

01:45.435 --> 01:47.970
We all draw
our moral lines in the sand.

01:48.038 --> 01:50.639
And unless you can put yourself
in another man's shoes,

01:50.707 --> 01:54.043
I don't think you can really
judge their situations.

01:54.111 --> 01:57.780
But look at the body language.

01:59.916 --> 02:01.384
They haven't
slept together yet.

02:01.451 --> 02:02.818
No?

02:02.886 --> 02:04.420
You can always tell
when a relationship's

02:04.488 --> 02:06.889
about to take that next step.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.065
I had a really
nice time tonight.

02:16.133 --> 02:18.434
Me too.

02:18.502 --> 02:20.469
But unfortunately,
if I don't get home,

02:20.537 --> 02:22.772
Walter's gonna start
wondering where I am.

02:22.839 --> 02:26.242
And then he'll probably start
calling the emergency rooms.

02:26.309 --> 02:28.778
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

02:28.845 --> 02:31.514
Thanks.
Have a good night.

02:31.581 --> 02:34.283
Uh, could you give me a moment?

02:34.351 --> 02:36.352
Yeah, of course.
I'll be outside.

02:38.000 --> 02:44.074

02:55.105 --> 02:56.872
Hi, Senator Van Horn.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.307
Hi, girls.

02:58.375 --> 03:00.576
You know, I've been looking
for some lemonade all day.

03:00.644 --> 03:01.744
You know where I can find some?

03:01.812 --> 03:03.579
- We're selling lemonade.
- You are?

03:03.647 --> 03:04.747
Well, perfect!

03:04.815 --> 03:06.816
Mrs. Van Horn has me
running all over town.

03:06.883 --> 03:09.585
I am parched.

03:09.653 --> 03:12.121
Oh, that looks delicious.
How much?

03:12.189 --> 03:13.756
- $1.00.
- $1.00?

03:13.824 --> 03:14.757
We made it ourselves.

03:14.825 --> 03:18.828
Well, I don't know.

03:18.895 --> 03:21.630
You know, this just might be

03:21.698 --> 03:24.233
the best lemonade
I have ever had.

03:24.301 --> 03:25.801
I'll see you, okay?

03:25.869 --> 03:27.102
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:27.170 --> 03:31.307
Wait!
You forgot your change!

03:32.943 --> 03:35.044
Victim is unresponsive.

03:35.111 --> 03:36.579
Possible head injury.

03:36.646 --> 03:38.347
I don't feel a pulse, doctor.
Charge v-fib?

03:38.415 --> 03:39.381
Not yet.

03:39.449 --> 03:40.382
But he has no pulse.

03:40.450 --> 03:41.717
Then why is he still breathing?

03:46.407 --> 03:48.257
- Patricia.
- Oh, Phillip.

03:48.325 --> 03:49.892
I heard on the news.

03:49.960 --> 03:52.094
I got here as fast as I could.

03:52.162 --> 03:53.362
How is he?

03:53.430 --> 03:56.899
I don't know.
They won't tell me anything.

03:58.568 --> 04:02.137
I want information
on James Van Horn.

04:09.279 --> 04:10.613
Prep for intubation
and alert the O.R.

04:10.680 --> 04:11.647
O.R. is standing by.

04:11.715 --> 04:12.982
Get me a CBC and tox screen.

04:13.049 --> 04:14.550
- What's his BP?
- I'm not getting anything.

04:14.618 --> 04:15.985
He has no pressure.

04:16.052 --> 04:17.486
Start CPR.

04:17.553 --> 04:19.387
What the hell is
going on with this guy?

04:22.526 --> 04:24.693
Stand aside, please.

04:24.761 --> 04:26.418
You can't be in here.

04:28.732 --> 04:30.499
Stay here.

04:35.839 --> 04:37.139
Stop right there!

04:41.444 --> 04:43.412
Freeze!

04:45.415 --> 04:47.783
FBI!
Drop your weapon!

04:51.054 --> 04:53.389
You, come here!

04:53.456 --> 04:54.857
I will kill her!

04:54.925 --> 04:58.360
Drop your weapon!
Do it!

04:58.428 --> 04:59.628
No!

05:44.912 --> 05:46.746
You can't seriously
expect me to believe

05:46.814 --> 05:47.947
that you're okay with this.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.782
Well, William's last wish
was that your father

05:49.850 --> 05:50.783
take over this company,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.185
my personal feelings
are not at issue.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.420
With a basement lab in Harvard,

05:54.488 --> 05:56.022
Walter was able
to open a wormhole

05:56.090 --> 05:57.323
into another dimension

05:57.391 --> 05:59.192
that essentially shredded
all the laws of science.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.927
I can't wait to see
what he's capable of doing

06:00.995 --> 06:03.529
with a multibillion-dollar
corporation.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.665
Your father made some
regrettable choices in the past,

06:05.733 --> 06:07.900
but his brilliance
is undeniable.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.269
It was that intellect
that William Bell believed in.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.971
And frankly, so do I.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.340
It's not his intellect
I'm concerned about.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.010
So beautiful,

06:17.077 --> 06:21.748
it is absolutely breathtaking.

06:21.815 --> 06:27.286
Somewhere between
pudding and foie gras.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.723
And why do I bring this up?
You, with the red hair.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.325
It's black.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.727
I see red.
Answer the question.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.928
I'm really not sure

06:35.996 --> 06:37.497
why we're talking
about brain physiology.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.432
Dear God.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.636
How can you be so limited?

06:43.704 --> 06:45.938
When William Bell
created this company,

06:46.006 --> 06:48.074
he knew one thing to be true.

06:48.142 --> 06:52.445
Brain and the mind
are capable of so much.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.914
Don't you see that the brain

06:54.982 --> 06:59.185
is consciousness, hmm?

06:59.253 --> 07:02.121
The mind is God!

07:07.594 --> 07:10.596
There are no limits,

07:10.664 --> 07:13.766
except for those
that we impose on ourselves.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.738
Open your eyes.
Open, open.

07:18.806 --> 07:22.475
Inspiration is everywhere.

07:22.543 --> 07:26.279
Do you know how lucky you are
to play in this sandbox?

07:26.346 --> 07:28.881
My heart is racing.
God!

07:30.017 --> 07:31.451
Is anyone else hot in here?

07:34.121 --> 07:36.122
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.623
Oh, Peter, you're
just in time for the good...

07:37.691 --> 07:39.058
Time to put your
pants back on, Walter.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.493
We got a case.
We have to go.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.262
Of course.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.764
I'll just get my things.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.567
He's a bit unorthodox.

07:47.634 --> 07:51.270
He's also trippin'
his brains out right now.

07:51.338 --> 07:54.874
- You know that, right?
- Mm.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.913
Van Horn was
admitted at 1400 hours.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.281
Newton came in
fifteen minutes later

08:02.349 --> 08:04.083
and went on a shooting spree.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.052
Look at that.
It's like he's got no fear.

08:06.120 --> 08:08.688
Clearly, Van Horn was
an operative of Newton's.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.223
We can only assume Newton knew.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.791
Van Horn's identity
as a shape-shifter

08:11.859 --> 08:13.960
would be revealed after
he was injured in the crash.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.728
So Newton came here
to retrieve him.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.364
And when he couldn't,
he shut him up.

08:18.432 --> 08:22.068
Oh, in the right light,

08:22.136 --> 08:26.339
your hair looks like
strands of lemon diamonds.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.840
He self-medicated
this morning.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.342
Don't worry.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.944
I do some of my finest work
self-medicated.

08:32.011 --> 08:35.148
Good, because not only
was James Van Horn

08:35.215 --> 08:38.518
a sitting U.S. senator
with top level clearance,

08:38.585 --> 08:41.320
he was a good man.

08:41.388 --> 08:43.623
I want to know how long ago
he was replaced

08:43.690 --> 08:45.291
by a shape-shifter
and for what purpose.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.660
I want a full accounting
of every committee he sat on,

08:47.728 --> 08:49.328
every classified briefing he had.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.664
Okay. Well, I'll make sure
that his office is locked down.

08:51.732 --> 08:54.734
Broyles, if they can get
to a sitting senator,

08:54.801 --> 08:56.068
the whole government
could be compromised.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.203
I know.

08:57.271 --> 09:00.206
I'm gonna call
Dan Gilmore at the CDC

09:00.274 --> 09:01.974
and arrange blood tests
for everyone on the hill.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.376
- Dr. Bishop?
- Mm-hmm?

09:03.443 --> 09:05.311
Examine the body,
see what you can find.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.180
Of course.

09:07.247 --> 09:10.221
I think I'll go examine the body
and see what I can find.

09:12.419 --> 09:16.622
- So is it a machine?
- No.

09:16.690 --> 09:20.526
Where can I purchase
some candy buttons?

09:20.594 --> 09:22.929
Those little candies
attached to rolls of paper.

09:22.996 --> 09:24.730
Do they still make those?

09:24.798 --> 09:28.534
I wouldn't know.
I try not to eat sugar.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.137
So if it's not a machine,
it's human?

09:31.205 --> 09:35.575
Nerve hook.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.211
To answer your question,

09:38.278 --> 09:42.248
it is neither and both.

09:42.316 --> 09:45.318
Part machine,

09:45.385 --> 09:47.486
part organic.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.388
A shape-shifter.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.357
Such an inspired creation.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.860
Frankly, I'm a little envious

09:54.928 --> 09:57.530
that Belly thought of it
before I did.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.000
How's it going in here?

10:04.137 --> 10:06.239
You'll be happy to know

10:06.306 --> 10:08.908
that having something
to focus on

10:08.976 --> 10:14.714
is calming the vividness
of my hallucinations.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.216
I think I'll probably be able
to take it from here, Agent.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.952
Thank you.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.021
So, Walter.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.590
I'm glad she's gone.

10:24.658 --> 10:28.728
Very negative energy.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.197
It seems pretty specific,
don't you think, Walter?

10:31.265 --> 10:32.732
One shot,
right through the eye?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.066
That's a good question.

10:34.134 --> 10:38.537
Assuming that Newton
shot the shape-shifter

10:38.605 --> 10:40.106
to incapacitate him,

10:40.173 --> 10:43.042
perhaps this is the location

10:43.110 --> 10:45.745
of some sort of power source.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.613
So assuming that you're right,

10:47.681 --> 10:51.250
do you think we could fix it?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.085
Fix him?

10:53.153 --> 10:55.721
We could try.

11:01.728 --> 11:02.828
Yes?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.497
What were you thinking?

11:04.564 --> 11:06.132
 Van Horn was
in a car accident.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.400
 He was a liability.
I had to act quickly.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.901
Okay. What did he know?

11:08.969 --> 11:10.803
 He was a senior operative.
He knew everything.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.505
- Did he know about me?
 - Of course.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.173
Who do you think
provided the information

11:14.241 --> 11:15.841
on Olivia Dunham
and the Fringe team?

11:15.909 --> 11:17.677
 Don't worry.
He's been disabled.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.812
Or as you people call it,
he's dead.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.515
He can't talk,
and data recovery's impossible.

11:22.582 --> 11:25.618
Your cover's safe, for now.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.653
What do you mean,
my cover is safe for now?

11:27.721 --> 11:30.523
 I don't know what
your mission is, Bolivia,

11:30.590 --> 11:33.793
and you've made it very clear
that it's none of my concern.

11:33.860 --> 11:38.764
Whatever it is,
I imagine it requires you

11:38.832 --> 11:40.633
to gain Peter Bishop's
complete trust.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.135
What makes you think
that I don't already have it?

11:43.203 --> 11:46.138
 Well, maybe it's because
I'm looking in from the outside,

11:46.206 --> 11:48.541
but I'm willing to wager
that somewhere,

11:48.608 --> 11:50.476
deep inside his brain,

11:50.544 --> 11:52.445
Peter Bishop
senses that something

11:52.512 --> 11:53.713
is not quite right with you,

11:53.780 --> 11:56.215
 that something has changed,

11:56.283 --> 11:59.785
 that you're not his Olivia.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.754
Okay, you need to remember
who you're talking to.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.556
 You're in over your head.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.825
You're not fully committed
to this task,

12:05.892 --> 12:08.894
 and because of that,
you will fail.

12:16.303 --> 12:19.805
Did you know,
in the 19th century,

12:19.873 --> 12:21.974
hatmakers used mercury

12:22.042 --> 12:25.177
to flatten the fur
on hat brims?

12:25.245 --> 12:28.714
Sadly, the mercury caused
significant brain damage.

12:28.782 --> 12:32.918
Hence, where Lewis Carroll
got the term "mad hatter."

12:32.986 --> 12:34.019
Thank you, Walter.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.956
That will be very helpful
next time I'm on Jeopardy!

12:37.023 --> 12:38.290
Eh!

12:39.493 --> 12:41.694
I can't animate
this shape-shifter.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.996
Not here.

12:44.064 --> 12:47.133
Perhaps if we moved the body
back to my lab...

12:47.200 --> 12:49.668
Sure, I'll have the body

12:49.736 --> 12:51.470
transferred back to Harvard
right away.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.839
No. My other lab.

12:53.907 --> 12:57.877
The equipment of Massive Dynamic
is state of the art.

12:57.944 --> 13:02.715
Okay.
I'll call Nina right now.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.252
Uh-oh. I think
I might be peaking again.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.422
Peter, perhaps
chamomile tea would help.

13:09.489 --> 13:11.991
Whoa, stop, stop.

13:12.058 --> 13:16.095
What'd you just do, Walter?

13:16.163 --> 13:19.064
I must have
triggered something.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.833
So how's it going in here?

13:20.901 --> 13:23.569
Agent Dunham, good news.

13:23.637 --> 13:28.541
It seems this tin can
is still kicking.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.735
Agent Astrid Farnsworth.

13:44.802 --> 13:47.804
I'm here to see Dr. Bishop.

13:47.872 --> 13:50.507
I've got an "Astro" Farnsworth.

13:50.575 --> 13:53.777
That's me, mm-hmm.

14:00.919 --> 14:02.185
You know, the old me

14:02.253 --> 14:05.422
would have been really
disgusted by that.

14:05.490 --> 14:06.990
Eh, finally.

14:07.058 --> 14:10.160
Did you get everything
on the list?

14:10.228 --> 14:11.862
I don't even want to know.

14:11.930 --> 14:13.463
Which one are you referring to?

14:13.531 --> 14:17.367
Both.

14:17.435 --> 14:19.069
Ha. Did you get
the candy buttons?

14:19.137 --> 14:20.237
Yeah, do you really
think that he's...

14:20.305 --> 14:23.540
- They're for me.
- Okay.

14:23.608 --> 14:26.577
Now, do you mind telling me
what all this stuff is for?

14:26.644 --> 14:28.579
We're making a treasure map.

14:28.646 --> 14:32.549
Somewhere inside this creature
is a data storage unit,

14:32.617 --> 14:35.886
and now that he's alive,
I'm going to find it.

14:35.954 --> 14:39.156
Using those items
as visual stimuli,

14:39.223 --> 14:42.225
we are going to map
its neural pathways...

14:42.293 --> 14:44.761
Well, what we would
think of as its brain.

14:44.829 --> 14:46.597
And what are we hoping to find?

14:46.664 --> 14:48.565
Its memories, Astrid.

14:48.633 --> 14:50.867
Everything it knows.

14:50.935 --> 14:52.736
Who it was working for.

14:52.804 --> 14:57.074
If there were others.

14:57.141 --> 14:58.442
You look shocked.

14:58.509 --> 15:01.311
You just called me Astrid.

15:01.379 --> 15:03.180
You never get my name right.

15:05.617 --> 15:08.418
Must be the LSD.

15:11.589 --> 15:14.091
These are Senator Van Horn's
Homeland Security briefings,

15:14.158 --> 15:15.826
going back three years.

15:15.893 --> 15:18.128
Great.
Thank you.

15:29.374 --> 15:30.540
You know, I can handle this,

15:30.608 --> 15:33.143
if you want to go check on Walter
and see how he's doing.

15:33.211 --> 15:35.212
Astrid must be there by now.

15:35.279 --> 15:38.582
If they've learned anything,
I'm sure they'll call.

15:46.658 --> 15:49.726
The senator made requests
for classified intelligence

15:49.794 --> 15:52.095
29 times last month.

15:52.163 --> 15:53.397
There's nothing here.

15:53.464 --> 15:55.065
Well, if he's like
the other shape-shifters,

15:55.133 --> 15:56.133
he's gonna be careful.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.334
He's not gonna leave
anything here

15:57.402 --> 15:59.703
that would tell us
he wasn't the senator.

15:59.771 --> 16:02.105
Except for one thing.

16:02.173 --> 16:05.275
He didn't know that today
was the day he was gonna die.

16:05.343 --> 16:07.644
Unless he had someone come
in here and clean up after him,

16:07.712 --> 16:09.379
there's got to be something.

16:12.984 --> 16:15.118
It's Rachel.
I should take this.

16:15.186 --> 16:16.853
- Tell her I said hi.
- Heh.

16:17.989 --> 16:19.456
Hey, Rache, what's up?

16:19.524 --> 16:21.858
Do you know it's customary
to leave one message,

16:21.926 --> 16:23.427
and the caller
will get back to you?

16:23.494 --> 16:25.762
Not thirty.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.464
He's alive.

16:27.532 --> 16:28.598
 Van Horn is alive.

16:28.666 --> 16:29.766
That's impossible.

16:29.834 --> 16:31.034
 You underestimated them.

16:31.102 --> 16:33.537
He's on the 23rd floor
of Massive Dynamic.

16:33.604 --> 16:35.605
Dr. Bishop's
working on him now.

16:35.673 --> 16:36.740
 I'll take care of it.

16:36.808 --> 16:37.874
You'd better.

16:37.942 --> 16:41.878
Hey, I think I found something.

16:51.189 --> 16:53.623
What is it?

16:55.727 --> 16:56.993
It's you.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.770
You... and me...

17:06.838 --> 17:08.538
and Walter...

17:08.606 --> 17:09.873
All of us.

17:11.108 --> 17:14.511
Every case we ever worked on.

17:14.579 --> 17:16.579
He knew everything.

17:27.992 --> 17:28.959
You want to pretend

17:29.026 --> 17:30.293
the train's going
into the station?

17:30.361 --> 17:32.329
I'm 7 1/2, mom.

17:32.396 --> 17:35.031
You forget you're dealing with
a very mature young man here.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.335
Ah, I'll tell them
we don't want any.

17:38.402 --> 17:40.604
Come on, asparagus, it's great.

17:40.671 --> 17:42.038
And it'll make your pee
smell funny.

17:43.174 --> 17:44.941
Real funny.

17:49.380 --> 17:52.549
Hello, Ray.

17:52.617 --> 17:56.319
I have an assignment for you.

18:01.616 --> 18:04.363
The body's in the
lab on the 23rd floor.

18:05.396 --> 18:07.497
You expect me to break into
Massive Dynamic?

18:07.565 --> 18:08.999
Oh, you don't have to.

18:09.066 --> 18:11.568
Just shift into a new body

18:11.636 --> 18:13.937
assigned to you still,
someone with clearance.

18:14.005 --> 18:17.908
It shouldn't be a problem.

18:17.975 --> 18:19.109
Is it?

18:19.177 --> 18:21.178
No. I'm just surprised.

18:21.245 --> 18:22.612
I haven't seen you
in five years.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.950
Oh, you know,
that's the way it works.

18:27.018 --> 18:31.054
After this mission,
you'll take a new identity.

18:31.122 --> 18:32.722
And Ray?

18:32.790 --> 18:36.059
No traces left behind.

18:36.127 --> 18:38.395
Nothing that can expose us.

18:38.462 --> 18:40.163
Understood?

18:40.231 --> 18:42.299
I'll contact you
when it's done.

18:42.366 --> 18:44.701
Good.

18:49.640 --> 18:52.042
I've got bureau agents stationed
throughout the building,

18:52.109 --> 18:54.377
and an NYPD security detail
has set up a perimeter.

18:54.445 --> 18:56.646
So what makes
you think that Newton

18:56.714 --> 18:58.448
would try to recover
the shape-shifter?

18:58.516 --> 19:00.483
I'd rather be wrong than sorry.

19:00.551 --> 19:03.019
- Good, I heard you were back.
- Hold on, Walter, hold on.

19:03.087 --> 19:05.355
According to the files
in Van Horn's office,

19:05.423 --> 19:07.357
he's been collecting intel
on us for the last two years.

19:07.425 --> 19:08.892
Which suggests
when he was shifted.

19:08.960 --> 19:11.895
Besides Newton, anything about
other shape-shifters?

19:11.963 --> 19:13.430
Anything that would tell us

19:13.497 --> 19:14.564
who they're working with,
how they get their orders?

19:14.632 --> 19:15.966
No.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.168
So did you find
anything in D.C.?

19:18.202 --> 19:20.303
We ran blood tests on every
person who works on the hill.

19:20.371 --> 19:21.504
Everyone checks out.

19:21.572 --> 19:23.006
What about the DOD and FBI?

19:23.074 --> 19:25.942
The shape-shifters could have
infiltrated their ranks too.

19:26.010 --> 19:27.110
We're testing everyone

19:27.178 --> 19:29.246
with a level four
classification or above.

19:29.313 --> 19:30.347
No, we've got to go wider.

19:30.414 --> 19:31.581
Van Horn can't be
the only mole.

19:31.649 --> 19:32.649
There's just no way...

19:32.717 --> 19:34.217
Maybe we should just ask him.

19:34.285 --> 19:37.087
- What?
- That's what I've been trying to say.

19:37.154 --> 19:38.622
If you want to know

19:38.689 --> 19:40.757
who the shape-shifter's
been working with,

19:40.825 --> 19:44.594
I think we should just ask him.

19:44.662 --> 19:46.062
Is it even possible

19:46.130 --> 19:47.697
that there's recoverable data
left in Van Horn?

19:47.765 --> 19:48.965
Walter thinks so.

19:49.033 --> 19:51.334
We've been trying
various techniques to locate it.

19:51.402 --> 19:52.969
At first, we did not have
very much luck.

19:53.037 --> 19:54.971
With everyday objects,
the shape-shifters

19:55.039 --> 19:56.139
only had a minimal reaction.

19:56.207 --> 19:58.708
But then we tried
something more personal.

19:58.776 --> 20:01.945
Watch the monitors closely.

20:02.013 --> 20:07.317
Here's what happens
when I show it a toy car.

20:07.385 --> 20:09.552
No neural activity.

20:09.620 --> 20:15.025
But when I show a photograph

20:15.092 --> 20:17.894
of the senator's wife...

20:17.962 --> 20:22.098
So those areas
are where the data is?

20:22.166 --> 20:25.101
No, we haven't found
any data storage.

20:25.169 --> 20:26.236
Not yet, we haven't,

20:26.304 --> 20:27.904
but I believe we can continue

20:27.972 --> 20:30.006
to revive the neural pathways

20:30.074 --> 20:32.842
by playing upon
this emotional tie.

20:32.910 --> 20:34.778
I'm not following, Walter.
It's a machine.

20:34.845 --> 20:38.148
Yes, and to succeed
in its mission,

20:38.215 --> 20:41.017
it needed to play
the role of a spouse.

20:41.085 --> 20:43.453
And pretending to have
an emotional connection

20:43.521 --> 20:45.255
caused a real one to form.

20:45.323 --> 20:48.024
The ability to process
complex emotions

20:48.092 --> 20:51.795
is built into the machine's
operating system.

20:51.862 --> 20:56.533
We just needed a stronger
trigger to find the data.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.935
We need to use Van Horn's wife.

20:59.003 --> 21:02.038
Oh, I don't think we can
ask that of a civilian, Walter.

21:02.106 --> 21:03.173
I mean, not to mention

21:03.240 --> 21:05.075
the security clearance
it would require.

21:05.142 --> 21:06.142
It's the only way.

21:06.210 --> 21:09.079
Broyles, I know
she's a friend of yours,

21:09.146 --> 21:10.313
but if we could get
at that data...

21:10.381 --> 21:12.048
I don't think it's a good idea.

21:12.116 --> 21:14.050
Imagine the panic if
she talks to the press.

21:14.118 --> 21:16.786
I've known Patricia Van Horn
for most of my adult life.

21:16.854 --> 21:20.357
Her character's beyond question.

21:20.424 --> 21:23.827
If she's willing to help us,
I'm willing to trust her.

22:11.724 --> 22:15.127
Hey, buddy, what
are you still doing up?

22:15.194 --> 22:17.796
I didn't sound
the monster alarm,

22:17.864 --> 22:20.699
but I think he's here.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.601
Where?

22:22.669 --> 22:25.103
Under the bed.

22:35.582 --> 22:38.884
You know...

22:38.952 --> 22:41.553
sometimes...

22:41.621 --> 22:43.989
monsters aren't all that bad.

22:44.057 --> 22:47.092
Sometimes...

22:47.160 --> 22:49.027
if you get to
spend some time with them,

22:49.095 --> 22:51.463
they can be very surprising.

22:51.531 --> 22:56.435
They can be, um,
incredibly sweet and pure

22:56.502 --> 23:00.339
and capable
of great, great love.

23:00.406 --> 23:03.275
And then, one of them
might actually become

23:03.343 --> 23:05.410
your very, very best friend.

23:05.478 --> 23:07.746
But you're my best friend.

23:15.121 --> 23:18.056
Yeah, that's right.

23:18.124 --> 23:20.792
Are you going to work?

23:20.860 --> 23:23.161
Yeah.

23:24.530 --> 23:28.066
Come check on me
when you get back?

23:31.571 --> 23:34.339
I will.

23:52.725 --> 23:55.293
Patricia, this is Agent
Olivia Dunham and Peter Bishop.

23:55.361 --> 23:56.728
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:56.796 --> 23:58.296
I'm, uh, I'm sorry.

23:58.364 --> 24:01.066
I know that what we're
asking you to do is difficult.

24:01.134 --> 24:05.737
Frankly, it all seems
a bit beyond comprehension.

24:05.805 --> 24:09.374
Last week was our
granddaughter's first birthday.

24:09.442 --> 24:11.810
You should have seen the way
Jim held her in his arms.

24:11.878 --> 24:13.345
He was so happy.

24:13.413 --> 24:18.383
And now, the thought that
he was really this thing...

24:18.451 --> 24:22.120
Patricia, if this
is too much for you...

24:22.188 --> 24:26.958
No.
I want to be here.

24:27.026 --> 24:30.162
I want to know who did this
to my husband.

24:30.229 --> 24:32.064
Well, that's what we're hoping
to find out too.

24:34.367 --> 24:36.702
You ready?

24:38.638 --> 24:40.872
I'm ready.

24:44.877 --> 24:49.981
Hi, James.
It's me, Patricia.

24:51.217 --> 24:53.452
Can you hear me?

24:57.557 --> 24:59.825
Is...
Is that what you want?

24:59.892 --> 25:02.527
Oh, it's perfect.

25:02.595 --> 25:07.442
But if you could please
talk to him and not at him.

25:10.912 --> 25:12.275
Okay.

25:13.439 --> 25:18.310
It's quiet in the house
without you.

25:19.712 --> 25:23.115
I finished the curtains.
I can't sleep.

25:23.182 --> 25:25.317
It's just something to do.

25:25.384 --> 25:27.385
No, no, no, this is not good.

25:27.453 --> 25:29.187
Um...

25:29.255 --> 25:31.990
Maybe if you could touch him.

25:32.058 --> 25:36.561
Um, perhaps a gentle
caress or tickle.

25:36.629 --> 25:37.896
Excuse me?

25:37.964 --> 25:40.499
Uh, I'm just suggesting
possible ways...

25:40.566 --> 25:42.768
No, it... It's okay.
I understand.

25:56.215 --> 25:59.918
Jim...

25:59.986 --> 26:04.156
The kids have been
asking for you.

26:04.223 --> 26:06.224
Grayson called yesterday.

26:06.292 --> 26:08.660
Neural activity is rising.

26:08.728 --> 26:11.596
Lucy said her first word.

26:11.664 --> 26:15.467
"Shoes."

26:15.535 --> 26:17.602
It's working.
We're close.

26:17.670 --> 26:21.973
I've been thinking
of all the years we had.

26:22.041 --> 26:25.410
I know it wasn't always easy.

26:29.348 --> 26:34.653
I'm sorry I didn't know...
you were gone.

26:34.720 --> 26:39.891
I-I don't know
how I didn't know.

26:39.959 --> 26:41.359
You would have known.

26:41.427 --> 26:44.062
I... I know you would have.

26:44.130 --> 26:48.133
Walter, the lower base
of his spine.

26:48.201 --> 26:52.637
No, something's wrong.
It doesn't make any sense.

26:52.705 --> 26:57.075
I don't know if you can
ever forgive me,

26:57.143 --> 26:59.578
- but I...
- 11, 10, 12, Whitefield.

26:59.645 --> 27:02.180
11, 13, 16, Beaufain.

27:02.248 --> 27:03.682
- Walter, what's happening?
- I don't know.

27:03.749 --> 27:04.749
11, 17, Essex.

27:04.817 --> 27:07.752
It could be ciphertext,
like a code, maybe.

27:07.820 --> 27:09.321
- No, he's on a loop.
- 11, 13...

27:09.388 --> 27:11.923
- Stop it!
- That's enough!

27:15.494 --> 27:17.863
What was that?

27:17.930 --> 27:19.931
I don't know.

27:19.999 --> 27:22.567
Maybe we triggered
a corrupted file,

27:22.635 --> 27:26.605
a mishmash of discarded data.

27:26.672 --> 27:28.306
No.

27:28.374 --> 27:30.842
I know what that was.

27:30.910 --> 27:35.180
Next month was our anniversary.

27:35.248 --> 27:38.383
The Beaufain,
the Whitefield, the Essex,

27:38.451 --> 27:40.352
they're all hotels.

27:40.419 --> 27:44.522
We were leaving November 10th.

27:44.590 --> 27:46.591
We're done here.

27:48.828 --> 27:51.529
Let me take you home.

27:51.597 --> 27:52.697
Did it help?

27:52.765 --> 27:54.833
Did you find
what you were looking for?

27:54.901 --> 27:58.403
You've done more than enough.

28:03.643 --> 28:04.876
It's no use.

28:04.944 --> 28:08.013
There has to be a way
to salvage more data.

28:09.815 --> 28:11.750
The shape-shifter's system's
too badly damaged.

28:13.052 --> 28:17.555
Any data in there
is likely lost.

28:21.627 --> 28:24.162
One thing I do know for sure,

28:24.230 --> 28:27.065
I am no longer high.

28:27.133 --> 28:28.767
Walter, why don't we
take a break

28:28.834 --> 28:29.935
and get something to eat?

28:30.002 --> 28:32.170
I don't have an appetite.

28:32.238 --> 28:34.072
Well, maybe just
a change of scenery

28:34.140 --> 28:35.240
might clear your head,

28:35.308 --> 28:37.909
make you feel better.

28:37.977 --> 28:41.513
I suppose so.

28:43.783 --> 28:46.384
Walter, I thought you said
you weren't hungry?

28:46.452 --> 28:49.054
I'm eating for comfort.

28:49.121 --> 28:51.823
To think what I put
that poor woman through,

28:51.891 --> 28:55.226
and the most activity we saw
occured in the shape-shifter's ass.

28:55.294 --> 28:59.030
It was his lower spine, Walter.

28:59.098 --> 29:02.067
Look, animal cookies.
You love these.

29:02.134 --> 29:04.703
No, Belly loved them.

29:04.770 --> 29:09.240
I occasionally eat them
to honor him, that is all.

29:09.308 --> 29:11.843
Walter, I'm just trying
to cheer you up.

29:11.911 --> 29:13.345
Thank you.

29:13.412 --> 29:16.014
Belly always thought
that dinosaur cookies

29:16.082 --> 29:17.983
would have been a better idea.

29:18.050 --> 29:22.420
Velociraptor, mm!
Dilophosaurus, yum!

29:22.488 --> 29:25.323
You know, I was more of
a stegosaurus fan myself.

29:25.391 --> 29:27.292
That was Belly's favorite too.

29:27.360 --> 29:31.763
The funny thing
about stegosaurus...

29:31.831 --> 29:35.300
Walter?
Walter, what just happened?

29:35.368 --> 29:38.803
I'll be right back.

29:38.871 --> 29:43.375
Oh, don't eat my pudding.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.311
Okay.

30:05.364 --> 30:07.365
Did you know
that the stegosaurus

30:07.433 --> 30:11.469
had a brain in its ass?

30:11.537 --> 30:13.405
Why didn't I think of it?

30:13.472 --> 30:17.976
The stegosaurus has
a massive cluster of nerves

30:18.044 --> 30:21.146
above the rump,
the sacral ganglion.

30:21.213 --> 30:23.048
Evolutionary leap.

30:23.115 --> 30:27.435
Separating short term memory
from long term memory.

30:28.926 --> 30:31.627
Belly, you ingenious
son of a bitch.

30:46.638 --> 30:49.006
Dr. Bishop, go right ahead.

30:49.073 --> 30:50.140
Thank you.

30:52.277 --> 30:54.778
You're not
authorized to be up here.

30:54.846 --> 30:58.982
Police are strictly
working the lobby.

30:59.050 --> 31:01.385
Sir.

31:01.452 --> 31:02.853
Patricia Van Horn

31:02.921 --> 31:05.055
was living with
a shape-shifter for two years.

31:05.123 --> 31:07.291
She must have noticed
something different.

31:07.358 --> 31:10.160
Oh, shape-shifters are good
at their job, you know?

31:10.228 --> 31:12.462
I've been thinking about it.

31:12.530 --> 31:15.132
Maybe she did notice,
and she just made excuses

31:15.199 --> 31:17.734
for herself not to
have to deal with it.

31:17.802 --> 31:20.304
Or she came up with ways
to explain it to herself.

31:20.371 --> 31:23.006
Kind of like I've been
doing with you.

31:23.074 --> 31:26.643
With me?

31:26.711 --> 31:29.980
Yeah.

31:30.048 --> 31:32.716
With all the little differences

31:32.784 --> 31:37.087
ever since we got back
from the other side.

31:37.155 --> 31:38.555
And you did tell me
that your experiences

31:38.623 --> 31:39.856
on the other side changed you,

31:39.924 --> 31:43.860
but since you got back,
it's like...

31:43.928 --> 31:45.762
It's like you're
a completely different person.

31:45.830 --> 31:47.497
You seem less burdened.

31:47.565 --> 31:49.099
You're more patient
with Walter.

31:49.167 --> 31:50.801
Don't get me wrong, I like it.

31:50.868 --> 31:52.502
The change is good.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.905
But it's different.

31:54.973 --> 31:56.440
Hey.

31:56.507 --> 31:59.142
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:02.313 --> 32:03.714
Where's Walter?

32:03.781 --> 32:05.048
I don't know.

32:05.116 --> 32:07.584
He said he'd be right back.

32:21.532 --> 32:24.001
Astrid, I need you
to adjust that light.

32:24.068 --> 32:26.336
Step away from him.

32:28.473 --> 32:29.573
Oh, oh!

32:29.640 --> 32:31.241
Stay right there.

32:31.309 --> 32:33.777
Don't move.

32:51.829 --> 32:55.132
It was in his spine.
I was right.

32:55.199 --> 32:59.036
Yeah, you were right.

33:09.547 --> 33:11.548
Look, he's probably just gone
to the restroom or something.

33:11.616 --> 33:13.650
No, he left his pudding.
Something must be wrong.

33:14.719 --> 33:17.487
Excuse me.

33:21.926 --> 33:23.026
Hey!

33:25.029 --> 33:26.363
That cop,
it must have been him.

33:26.431 --> 33:28.899
Okay, you look for Walter,
I'll go after the shape-shifter.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.187
Walter?

33:50.254 --> 33:52.055
Walter!

33:52.123 --> 33:54.157
Walter.
Walter, look at me.

33:54.225 --> 33:55.392
Hey, Walter?

33:55.460 --> 33:57.294
Walter!

33:57.361 --> 33:58.361
Hey.

33:58.429 --> 34:01.198
Son?

34:01.265 --> 34:03.834
The stegosaurus, Peter.

34:03.901 --> 34:05.335
It has two brains.

34:05.403 --> 34:07.904
That's what they were after.

34:07.972 --> 34:10.373
I, uh, I couldn't find him.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.507
So is he all right?

34:11.576 --> 34:13.110
He took a pretty bad
knock on the head.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.643
I'll be fine.

34:15.913 --> 34:17.920
Uh, this is Dunham.
We're on floor 23.

34:17.922 --> 34:19.565
I need the EMTS here now, please.

34:19.583 --> 34:21.451
Listen to me,
there was someone here.

34:21.518 --> 34:23.353
We know, Walter.
There was a shape-shifter here.

34:23.420 --> 34:24.754
And they took
what we were after.

34:24.822 --> 34:27.157
He took the data
out of Van Horn.

34:27.225 --> 34:29.960
Walter?
Walter, oh, my God!

34:30.027 --> 34:31.360
What?

34:33.764 --> 34:36.500
Walter, are you okay?

34:36.567 --> 34:39.101
Under the circumstances,
I'm fine.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.737
I could have been killed.

34:40.804 --> 34:42.005
What are you doing?

34:42.072 --> 34:43.607
The security cameras.

34:43.674 --> 34:44.875
If we can I.D. the shape-shifter,

34:44.942 --> 34:46.909
maybe we can catch him
before he changes bodies.

34:47.978 --> 34:49.179
Oh, come on.

34:49.246 --> 34:51.181
Peter.

34:55.820 --> 34:58.788
Ownership has its privileges.

35:25.983 --> 35:29.119
You didn't shift.

35:29.187 --> 35:32.822
I didn't have to.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.424
I got it.

35:38.696 --> 35:40.096
Don't worry about them.

35:40.164 --> 35:42.632
I took care of it.
We're clean.

35:46.537 --> 35:49.773
Why did you do that?

35:52.443 --> 35:53.843
I didn't.

35:53.911 --> 35:56.880
I couldn't understand
your hesitation.

35:56.948 --> 36:01.318
I saw it, but I didn't
understand it.

36:01.385 --> 36:02.886
I do now.

36:02.954 --> 36:07.624
It's... It's them,
isn't it?

36:07.692 --> 36:10.026
I got the disc.
I found a way...

36:10.094 --> 36:12.295
And now it's time
for you to move on.

36:12.363 --> 36:15.465
No.
This is my life.

36:15.533 --> 36:16.766
And now you'll have
another life,

36:16.834 --> 36:19.803
just like you had
another one before.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.639
This is simply
a way station for you.

36:22.707 --> 36:24.608
A stop along the way.

36:24.675 --> 36:28.011
It's what we do.
It's what we're made for.

36:28.079 --> 36:30.146
No, no, no.

36:30.214 --> 36:32.816
It means so much to me

36:32.883 --> 36:37.821
and I've come to mean
so much to them.

36:37.888 --> 36:41.491
How can you ask me
to give them up?

36:45.329 --> 36:47.998
Well, I suppose I can't.

37:13.324 --> 37:16.526
Keep your hands where
I can see them!

38:33.871 --> 38:35.572
Get back in your car!

38:35.639 --> 38:36.973
I need to reach Agent Broyles.

38:37.041 --> 38:38.007
It's urgent.

38:38.075 --> 38:39.943
Newton.

38:40.010 --> 38:41.244
Newton, where is it?

38:41.312 --> 38:42.245
Is he alive?

38:42.313 --> 38:43.446
Where is it?

38:43.514 --> 38:45.315
He's breathing.
Yeah.

38:50.821 --> 38:52.122
Does he have the disc?

38:52.189 --> 38:54.357
I can't find it, but, uh,

38:54.425 --> 38:57.494
we can search properly
when I get him into custody.

38:57.561 --> 39:00.296
All right.

39:28.348 --> 39:30.615
Is the Van Horn disc secure?

39:30.683 --> 39:32.684
It is.

39:45.932 --> 39:49.000
You're gonna have a very
difficult time without me, you know?

39:49.068 --> 39:53.972
Well, there are plenty
of machines here.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.608
I can befriend
a vacuum cleaner.

39:59.212 --> 40:00.278
You're very good at that.

40:00.346 --> 40:02.681
At what?

40:02.749 --> 40:07.686
At continuing to try to convince
yourself that you don't care.

40:07.754 --> 40:10.055
But you do care, don't you?

40:10.123 --> 40:14.259
Every night when your head
hits the pillow

40:14.327 --> 40:16.895
in the last moments before
you go to sleep,

40:16.963 --> 40:20.065
your emotions betray you

40:20.133 --> 40:22.300
and you question your ability
to pull this off.

40:22.368 --> 40:26.772
Words like, "integrity,"
"self-respect,"

40:26.839 --> 40:28.440
they haunt you.

40:28.508 --> 40:31.042
They form a line that
you're unwilling to cross

40:31.110 --> 40:34.613
and that will lead
to your undoing.

40:37.417 --> 40:42.387
But I suppose that's
not my problem anymore.

41:13.786 --> 41:16.855
Here you go.

41:55.428 --> 41:58.096
I lied to you.

41:58.164 --> 42:01.399
About what?

42:04.136 --> 42:07.172
Uh...
I don't want to talk.
