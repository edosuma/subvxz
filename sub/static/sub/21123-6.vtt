[Zoe] <i>And then it all went black.</i>
<i>I remember hearing Rosie crying,</i>

00:40.280 --> 00:43.200
<i>Mom yelling something,
the sound of an ambulance,</i>

00:43.600 --> 00:44.680
<i>then nothing.</i>

00:45.000 --> 00:47.680
<i>But I'm okay. Totally okay.</i>

00:48.120 --> 00:50.400
<i>A little shaken, but on the plus side...</i>

00:50.880 --> 00:54.360
Look, I got a bruise on my arm
that's in the shape of a dinosaur.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.240
<i>Now, Zoe, as your father,</i>

00:57.320 --> 01:02.280
<i>it's my duty to tell you that going
after those thieves was dangerous</i>

01:02.360 --> 01:05.720
<i>- and reckless and...</i>
- I had no choice.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.680
<i>And seriously...</i>

01:08.640 --> 01:09.640
<i>awesome.</i>

01:09.680 --> 01:10.920
[all laughing]

01:11.000 --> 01:12.680
<i>Do not tell your mother I said that.</i>

01:12.760 --> 01:14.920
Oh, I'll go get her.
You can tell her yourself.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.960
<i>No, no, no. Rosie, I... I didn't mean...</i>

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
<i>Mm.</i>

01:18.920 --> 01:19.760
We miss you, Dad.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.480
<i>I miss you, too, sweetheart.</i>

01:22.040 --> 01:24.240
- Mom said she'll catch up with you later.
<i>- Later?</i>

01:24.840 --> 01:27.320
<i>I gotta go to bed.
I'm missing out on my beauty sleep.</i>

01:27.400 --> 01:28.400
[giggling]

01:28.440 --> 01:32.920
- I think it's a little too late for that.
<i>- Wise guy, huh? </i>[laughs]

01:33.480 --> 01:35.480
<i>Hey, show me... Show me that bruise again.</i>

01:36.440 --> 01:38.080
- Can you see it?
<i>- Mm...</i>

01:38.640 --> 01:40.600
<i>Brontosaurus. Uh...</i>

01:40.680 --> 01:41.520
T. rex.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.720
Personally,
I think it looks more like a poop emoji.

01:44.920 --> 01:45.920
<i>Wow, you're right.</i>

01:46.000 --> 01:47.640
<i>You have poop on your arm.</i>

01:47.720 --> 01:48.800
No!

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
Oh.

01:57.640 --> 02:01.000
Well, hello mystery box
that I definitely didn't put there.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.440
I know you have a million questions.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.080
Why were you riding last night, Mom?
Is something going on with you and Elliot?

02:09.640 --> 02:11.760
Elliot? [laughing] No. No.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.680
We knew each other when we were kids.

02:15.200 --> 02:18.480
I told him I wanted to try riding again.
He was just helping me out.

02:18.720 --> 02:21.200
- You used to ride?
- A long time ago.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
Why'd you stop?

02:23.480 --> 02:24.760
Lost interest, I guess.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.120
I lost my nerve, maybe.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.720
It's been hard seeing you
fall in love with it the way I did.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.320
It's just you and me, Mom. Tell me.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.400
I used to have a horse.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.080
- Emerald.
- [Rosie] Emerald?

02:41.600 --> 02:42.640
E's a horse.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.240
Gramps, it's all okay. E is just a horse.

02:46.320 --> 02:51.040
- Okay, now it's just you and me.
- [chuckles]

02:52.160 --> 02:54.760
- What happened to Emerald?
- There was an accident.

02:56.480 --> 02:57.840
We were both badly hurt.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.480
- Is that why you don't want me to ride?
- Open it.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.240
That's why I was riding. I thought
if I could get over my own fears,

03:21.320 --> 03:24.840
it would help me accept that you're going
to ride whether I like it or not.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.400
You mean,
I can literally go to the stables,

03:28.480 --> 03:30.240
get on a horse, no drama?

03:30.800 --> 03:32.880
- Yes, but listen...
- Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.240
I want to learn everything.
I want to canter without stirrups,

03:36.320 --> 03:38.680
- I wanna jump, I wanna go on beach rides.
- Zoe...

03:38.760 --> 03:41.160
I... Maybe they can give me
a lesson this morning.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.040
- Promise me you'll be careful.
- You got it.

03:44.120 --> 03:46.480
- Bright Fields here I come!
- [sighs]

03:59.960 --> 04:01.160
Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.520
Okay. Okay.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.200
Hey, Ben.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.800
Hey, Zoe. Check these out.
Aren't they cool?

04:17.920 --> 04:19.200
Horse Thief Hero returns.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.400
Ugh. Don't call me that.
I wanna have a cool superhero name.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.160
The Equestrian Avenger?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.640
- Tack-Man?
- Horse Thief Hero it is.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.920
Wait till you see what Elliot's done.
There's security cameras

04:31.000 --> 04:32.200
recording our every move.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.960
Which would've been useful to know
before I picked Bob's nose.

04:35.720 --> 04:38.680
- Looks like Ben's made some new friends.
- Yeah, with quad bikes.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.840
Oh, my quad, Zoe, it's the worst.
He's lost all interest in horses,

04:41.920 --> 04:43.120
he's not helping with Bob,

04:43.200 --> 04:45.800
- and I can't do it all.
- That sounds drastic.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.880
Is that the time?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.320
Oh. No, Becky.

04:48.400 --> 04:51.160
That's the date.
The time is right over there.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.400
Even worse.
I'm late for my shift at the caf.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.240
Right, Jade, you're looking after Bob.

04:55.320 --> 04:58.120
Two feeds, plenty of kisses,
and whatever happens,

04:58.760 --> 05:00.160
don't let him get bored.

05:00.240 --> 05:02.440
I think I can handle Bob, Becky.
Don't worry.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.440
That's what he wants you to think.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.200
Watch it!

05:06.480 --> 05:07.680
Out of the way, sis!

05:09.360 --> 05:11.440
- To the yard.
- [Jade] To the yard.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.520
[Zoe sighs]

05:13.480 --> 05:15.240
We showed those horses thieves,
right, boy?

05:15.320 --> 05:16.320
[Raven neighs]

05:17.200 --> 05:18.640
Have you seen the cameras?

05:19.360 --> 05:22.000
Infrared motion sensors,
a brand-new backup generator,

05:22.080 --> 05:24.760
which means it will never go down.
State-of-the-art stuff.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.600
It must have cost Elliot a fortune.

05:26.680 --> 05:29.240
"Oh, no, nothing's too expensive
for my little girl.

05:29.320 --> 05:32.360
My money keeps this yard going,
and Sam quivers with fear at my..."

05:32.440 --> 05:33.760
- Hi, Sam.
- [gasps]

05:35.640 --> 05:37.400
[Sam] Zoe,
it is so great to have you back.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.480
Mm-hmm.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.360
Have they caught the thieves yet?
Does Derek have any leads at all?

05:43.440 --> 05:46.640
The police say they were just
opportunists. They won't be back.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.080
Not that they could get in now,
even if they tried.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.160
I have noticed.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.120
Your mom called.
You've got a lesson with Marcus.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.040
I'd take it myself, but I'm snowed under
with all the paperwork for the barn dance.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.760
- I'll help. I love paperwork.
- It's true, she does.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.120
Thank you. That would be great. Then I can
get on with tryouts for the horse show.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.240
You guys have tryouts?

06:05.320 --> 06:07.320
Yeah, the county show's a pretty big deal.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, this year the prize is £15,000.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.600
Which would be a really big help
with the bills now.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.600
- Holloway Riding School always beats us.
- No, not this year.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.160
Do you think I could ride Raven?

06:18.240 --> 06:21.080
I mean, we do have this bond,
and I figured it'd be great...

06:21.160 --> 06:22.760
Nice try, Zoe. No.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.440
My insurance doesn't cover
"girl squished by troubled horse."

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200
You're not riding Raven.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.480
That was pretty final.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.800
At least she didn't hear
my Elliot impression.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.960
And for the record,
I never quiver in fear in front of anyone.

06:45.680 --> 06:46.720
[ATV engine revving]

06:47.280 --> 06:48.760
Get on. [laughs]

06:51.720 --> 06:52.720
[Rosie] Hey.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.000
Okay.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.720
I need a gift for my mom.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.040
Something that says,
"Enough of England. Let's go home."

07:01.120 --> 07:02.480
[Ben] This is so cool.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.480
[engine revving]

07:06.960 --> 07:08.000
How much for these?

07:09.960 --> 07:12.040
Free. In exchange for some advice?

07:12.120 --> 07:13.920
Yeah, my advice is pretty valuable.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.896
What would you do
if Zoe stopped caring about horses?

07:19.920 --> 07:22.680
I'd call everyone I know
and throw a massive party.

07:24.520 --> 07:28.240
If Ben keeps trying to be cool with
his new friends, we're gonna lose Bob.

07:28.320 --> 07:30.920
I haven't got time to work here
and look after our horse.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.600
- Easy. Ditch the stinky horse.
- Never.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.360
Okay, then why don't you
just talk to Ben about it?

07:36.440 --> 07:37.680
I never see him anymore.

07:37.760 --> 07:40.040
- [Ben] I can't see a thing.
- [Rosie] You miss him?

07:40.120 --> 07:41.120
No.

07:42.240 --> 07:43.400
Okay, maybe a little.

07:44.680 --> 07:46.920
At least I'm not the only one
with family issues.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.960
Okay, if we wanna fix this

07:49.040 --> 07:52.040
then we need to show Ben
that horses are much cooler than ATVs.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.760
- How?
- Leave that to me.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.040
I have a plan.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.040
I've made three piles.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.080
The country show pile,
the barn dance pile,

08:01.160 --> 08:03.320
and I'm calling this one the "scary" pile.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.280
It looks like bills.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.920
- Is Bright Fields in trouble?
- They're... Um...

08:09.000 --> 08:10.960
It's personal.
It's nothing to worry about.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.040
Thank you for this. You're a lifesaver.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.120
I'll go get on with the show tryouts.
Yours is at 11.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.920
Thank you. I know I probably
won't make it again, but...

08:21.000 --> 08:22.880
What did we say about positive thinking?

08:24.000 --> 08:27.200
Oh, there's some emergency chocolate
somewhere around here.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.320
If you can find it, it's all yours.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.480
[Bob neighing]

08:49.600 --> 08:52.080
All right, Bob. I get it, you're bored.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.160
But...

08:53.920 --> 08:54.920
look.

08:56.520 --> 08:58.400
Here's a video of horses and ponies.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.520
[neighing]

09:07.000 --> 09:09.080
I don't know
what Becky was so worried about.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.640
Keeping you entertained is easy.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.080
[cell phone buzzes]

09:18.160 --> 09:20.080
Right, time for tryouts.

09:22.240 --> 09:23.840
I'm going to make it this year, Bob.

09:24.320 --> 09:25.400
Positive thinking.

09:26.280 --> 09:27.280
Okay, right.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.200
Now, no getting bored, Bobble-chops.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.560
- How's Sparkles looking on camera?
- Gorgeous.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.536
I can't believe
your dad bought you another horse.

09:40.560 --> 09:42.680
Ha. Well, I'm worth it.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.600
Oh, Zoe. [scoffs]

09:48.240 --> 09:49.720
Where'd you find that old hat?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.760
Loving the vintage look, Zoe.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.560
I think we could probably find
a corset around somewhere.

09:54.640 --> 09:56.440
It was actually my mom's.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.200
Oh, how sweet.

09:58.280 --> 10:00.280
[Marcus] Hey. You can wear what you want.

10:00.360 --> 10:03.160
You chased off a gang of horse thieves.
Who does that?

10:03.240 --> 10:05.880
It was just an average Wednesday night
for us Americans.

10:05.960 --> 10:09.360
Yeah, well, now we've got
a wonderful new security system.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.120
We don't need any more heroics.

10:11.200 --> 10:13.400
Yeah, Super Zoe can stand down.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.080
Well, Mia,
next time your horse needs saving,

10:16.160 --> 10:18.160
feel free to use the Super Zoe signal,
yeah?

10:18.880 --> 10:21.440
Susie. Come on, it's time for my tryout.

10:24.720 --> 10:25.720
Hey.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.960
So, are you actually allowed
to train today,

10:29.040 --> 10:30.880
or is your mom gonna yell at me again?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.240
Okay, that... was one time.

10:35.880 --> 10:39.360
Okay, we'll start you off slowly today
and work on your foundations.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.760
- Stick to a walk for now.
- Are you kidding?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.240
A walk? No, no, no. I galloped.

10:44.640 --> 10:47.560
- You can't make me walk.
- Um. Yes I can. Walk on.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.040
But I found my thing.
You know how many people

10:50.120 --> 10:53.840
spend their lives looking for their thing?
I'm literally sitting on mine.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
Please?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.240
Don't hold me back.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.320
There you go. Good.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.280
Now, this is called an active walk.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.880
This is called a bored girl
on a bored horse.

11:06.960 --> 11:11.040
[sighs] This is riding. It's a process.
A foundation.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.800
Process-smocess. Come on, Marcus.
I want to ride.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.320
Just let me go over the jump,
and then I'll be quiet.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.800
Horses are wild animals, Zoe.
You need to learn respect.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.640
And you need to learn to respect
the wishes of the Horse Thief Hero.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.480
You have a lot of natural talent...

11:27.560 --> 11:29.680
but we need to get
the building blocks in place first.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.120
They are in place.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.960
Still need to respect the rules, Zoe.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.400
You wanna know what I say to you
and your rules?

11:35.480 --> 11:37.000
[Zoe clicking tongue]

11:37.080 --> 11:38.080
Zoe.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.040
Do not go over that jump, Zoe.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.360
But you're right.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.440
We should just keep walking around.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.400
Marcus, you ready for your tryout?

11:55.920 --> 11:59.200
Jade's finished, and I've got
my appointment on the mainland in an hour.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.280
I'm there the rest of the afternoon.
I can't be late.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.120
Cool. I think we're done here.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.960
Zoe, will you tack up Raven?

12:09.520 --> 12:10.520
Are you serious?

12:10.880 --> 12:13.800
Not to ride. Just getting used
to a saddle. I wanna keep working on it.

12:13.880 --> 12:14.880
Oh.

12:15.080 --> 12:17.520
- Right.
- Till next time, Horse Thief Hero.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.600
All right, Major.
Well, I guess we're done for the day.

12:24.120 --> 12:25.120
Come on.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
Bye.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.040
[chimes]

12:43.120 --> 12:44.400
[neighs]

12:55.520 --> 12:56.800
[neighs]

12:56.880 --> 12:58.440
You sure this is gonna work?

12:58.520 --> 13:01.360
Trust me. Everything I touch turns
to glitter and sparkles.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.440
I can see that.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.000
- Did you call Ben?
- They're on their way.

13:05.560 --> 13:08.800
Hey, Jade, just in time.
Take me to my horse.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.200
- He has a special quest ahead of him.
- I don't know what you were talking about.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.640
Bob's been as good as gold.
See you, Rosie.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.920
Back in a hack.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.400
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:23.320 --> 13:24.320
So...

13:25.560 --> 13:27.640
we're just gonna try this out, okay?

13:28.800 --> 13:30.880
If it works, it works. If it doesn't...

13:32.480 --> 13:34.040
it doesn't. All right.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.040
- [neighs]
- See?

13:41.840 --> 13:44.920
I know it feels weird,
but you are doing really well.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.200
Wanna push it a little further?

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
Let's try it.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.440
Okay. Almost done.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.680
Hey, hey, hey.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.800
You see?

14:10.880 --> 14:11.920
[neighs]

14:18.720 --> 14:21.520
I guess there's one more thing
we could try.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.720
Can't believe you've done so well
with Bob.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.120
I thought you'd really struggle.
No offense.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.680
No, looking after him
has been a piece of...

14:29.400 --> 14:30.400
cake.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.960
Bob, what have you done?

14:33.520 --> 14:34.440
[Bob neighs]

14:34.520 --> 14:37.880
- He's eaten Sam's emergency chocolate.
- At least he left some for me.

14:38.440 --> 14:40.960
Come. Let's show the world
how much horsepower you've got.

14:41.040 --> 14:44.400
- I'll just clear up in here then, shall I?
- I think you'll need to.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.320
Sam will flip if she sees this mess.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.040
"Raven."

15:03.400 --> 15:04.440
No way.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.640
Surely one little ride
around the paddock won't hurt.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.840
Hello.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.240
- What's this?
- Looks like a race.

15:28.320 --> 15:29.600
Good guess, Einstein.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.200
Too right it's a race.
I'm gonna show your mates

15:32.280 --> 15:35.480
that when it comes to horses and bikes,
horses win every time.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.280
Yeah, that's right.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.680
Her horse will outpace you guys
in a heartbeat.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.920
Wait. You're using Bob?

15:44.880 --> 15:46.600
- Of course.
- Is that even a horse?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.280
Looks more like a hairy cow.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.400
[Bob neighs]

15:49.480 --> 15:54.120
- This is pointless. Let's just go.
- No way, this is gonna be hilarious.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.880
You don't have to do this.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.120
- Yes, I do.
- Come on. Let's show them.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.480
Just... do your best.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.520
Positions, please.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.040
- [neighs]
- Hey. Hey, it's okay.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.440
We did it, Raven.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.920
I'm so gonna kick your butt.

16:27.280 --> 16:28.720
Kick butt all you want...

16:29.280 --> 16:31.640
- I'm wearing padded pants.
- Please, stop her.

16:31.720 --> 16:34.120
It's a little too late for that. Ready...

16:35.080 --> 16:36.120
set...

16:36.880 --> 16:38.040
go!

16:40.480 --> 16:41.520
Faster, Bob, faster.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.400
Come on, Bob. Come on.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.040
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:04.360 --> 17:05.360
Bob.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.000
Bob!

17:10.080 --> 17:11.840
[Raven whinnies]

17:12.400 --> 17:13.920
Raven, stop!

17:14.680 --> 17:16.960
Zoe, what are you doing?

17:24.960 --> 17:25.960
[Zoe] Help!

17:34.120 --> 17:35.280
Is that my sister?

17:38.600 --> 17:39.680
Stop it, Raven!

17:44.760 --> 17:46.000
Whoa, okay, okay.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.560
Raven, stop it!

18:04.280 --> 18:06.280
[engine stops]

18:08.000 --> 18:09.920
Sure hope she knows what she's doing.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.560
Do you think I could get riding lessons?

18:13.080 --> 18:15.000
In your face, quad bikers.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.520
- Zoe totally saved the day again.
- I'm not sure she meant to.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.600
Zoe, hang on!

18:32.560 --> 18:33.840
[Zoe] Where are you taking me?!

18:36.480 --> 18:37.600
Raven, stop!

18:39.480 --> 18:40.880
Whoa, whoa! No, no.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.680
No, no.

18:47.800 --> 18:48.800
[grunts, whimpers]

18:50.240 --> 18:52.160
[gasping]

19:04.720 --> 19:06.240
Why are you doing this?

19:06.320 --> 19:07.720
What's wrong with you?

19:07.800 --> 19:09.400
Why can't you just listen?

19:10.640 --> 19:12.920
This is what happens when you push things.

19:14.440 --> 19:17.760
I told you. I warned you.
You need to learn the basics first.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.840
He's not ready. And neither are you.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.000
- I'm so sorry.
- Raven could've been hurt.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.840
- And you could've been.
- I know, I know. Okay?

19:27.680 --> 19:29.880
You can ride back with me on Monty,
if you like.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.160
- We're going on the roads.
- Thank you, Marcus, but...

19:33.680 --> 19:35.480
I think I'm just gonna walk, okay?

20:20.400 --> 20:22.040
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.080
I'm fine.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.720
You're shaking.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.000
- Did something happen at the stables?
- Um...

20:32.080 --> 20:33.200
Raven took off with me.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.440
I was so scared.

20:36.520 --> 20:39.560
- Wait, Sam put you on Raven?
- No, I kind of did.

20:40.120 --> 20:41.400
You rode him without permission?

20:42.800 --> 20:45.000
- Yup.
- Oh, Zoe.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.720
This is all my fault.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.080
Why?

21:05.360 --> 21:06.360
This is Emerald.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.360
Your horse.

21:14.280 --> 21:15.760
I had a fight with your grandma.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.360
A silly fight.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.360
And I rode out on Emerald during a storm.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.920
I should've turned back,
but I had something to prove.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.400
So, we rode on.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.800
But we were going too fast and...

21:37.960 --> 21:39.640
he slipped, and I fell off him.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
What happened?

21:42.720 --> 21:43.720
He got me home.

21:45.200 --> 21:46.200
But...

21:47.160 --> 21:48.920
he broke his leg. [sighs]

21:51.000 --> 21:52.000
My friend came...

21:53.560 --> 21:54.960
stopped him hurting.

21:56.720 --> 21:57.880
Emerald died?

22:00.680 --> 22:01.760
And afterwards...

22:02.920 --> 22:04.200
things were never the same.

22:04.920 --> 22:07.560
I felt so guilty, so angry.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.400
I lashed out at everyone.
Mom didn't know how to help.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.880
There was a book in your room.
She wrote in it:

22:14.480 --> 22:16.320
"The light will come through again."

22:16.960 --> 22:17.960
But it didn't.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.480
Not till I left this place.

22:23.760 --> 22:25.000
Maybe it still hasn't.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.480
I should've told you earlier.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.400
Then you'd have understood.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.040
Riding is dangerous
if you don't respect the horse.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.400
I'm going to tell Sam
I don't wanna ride again.

22:40.960 --> 22:43.640
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.680
You know what, sis? You were right.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.600
Horses are way cooler than quad bikes.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.720
Mind putting him back
and giving his bum a clean?

22:55.800 --> 22:57.200
Nothing would make me happier.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.640
That's so sweet. [chuckles]

23:00.960 --> 23:02.400
And so disgusting.

23:02.960 --> 23:04.800
Becky, I officially take it back.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.200
Bob is impossible.
You guys are made for each other.

23:08.280 --> 23:09.960
- Aww. Thanks, Jade.
- [laughs]

23:12.200 --> 23:15.200
Rosie. I just wanted to say, um...

23:15.280 --> 23:18.280
I know, I know. When it comes
to getting people back together,

23:18.360 --> 23:19.640
I have an incredible gift.

23:20.440 --> 23:23.800
I was just gonna say thanks,
but, yeah, sure. That, too.

23:25.160 --> 23:26.200
- Bye, guys.
- [Jade] Bye.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.880
Next stop,
getting Mom and Dad back together.

23:36.560 --> 23:37.400
- Zoe.
- Hey.

23:37.480 --> 23:39.400
I found something earlier. Look.

23:39.720 --> 23:40.720
- Is that...?
- Raven.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.840
- With...?
- Ted.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.000
I don't understand. Pin has never said
anything about owning Raven.

23:45.080 --> 23:46.800
Well, it's definitely his dad.

23:46.880 --> 23:49.640
This photo was taken outside their house.
Hawthorne.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.760
- Why would Pin lie to me?
- Maybe he's covering for someone.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.560
I found it in Sam's office
along with a lot of unpaid bills.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.160
Which explains why she needs us
to win the county show.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.720
- [Becky] It's up.
- The team list has been posted.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.200
Come on!

24:11.680 --> 24:12.680
[Becky laughs]

24:15.080 --> 24:17.200
Good news.
Me and Bob made the dressage event.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.320
We're gonna plan something so special.
Look out, world, Bob's coming for you.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.600
"Marcus, Mia, Susie, Jade..."

24:25.160 --> 24:26.160
Wait, what?

24:26.520 --> 24:28.280
I made the show-jumping team.

24:29.680 --> 24:31.440
But she didn't even do a tryout.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.720
This is completely unfair.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.520
I won't stand for it.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.840
It's my horse. Where's Sam?

24:39.280 --> 24:41.560
I hope you're feeling heroic. Come look.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.440
[Zoe] <i>I made alternate...</i>

24:49.880 --> 24:50.880
<i>with Raven.</i>
