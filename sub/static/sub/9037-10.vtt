00:18.786 --> 00:20.486
Oh, man, I haven't seen him
since high school.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.787
- Well, you'll
see him Saturday.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.555
He's going
to your reunion.

00:23.557 --> 00:24.790
- You have a reunion?

00:24.792 --> 00:26.725
- No, no.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.561
- Wait a minute,
this would be your 20th reunion.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.296
Ray, why didn't you
tell me about this?

00:31.298 --> 00:33.232
- 'cause I'm not going, okay?

00:33.234 --> 00:35.067
Only losers
go to those things.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.568
- Thank you.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.738
- You know, I'm planning
on going to my 20th.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.641
Does that make me a loser?

00:42.643 --> 00:43.675
- Four years away,

00:43.677 --> 00:45.644
And you're already
planning it?

00:45.646 --> 00:49.181
Um, uh...

00:49.183 --> 00:50.181
- You know, raymond,

00:50.183 --> 00:51.650
You should really think about
going, you know?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.419
It's like your own personal
"twilight zone."

00:53.421 --> 00:56.221
I mean, the last time you saw
everybody was graduation, right?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.389
And then pow!

00:57.391 --> 00:59.191
Everybody's
20 years older.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.529
Spooky.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.531
- Come on, ray, you never
talk about high school.

01:05.533 --> 01:06.799
I want to see
that part of your life.

01:06.801 --> 01:08.700
I want to see
what made you you.

01:08.702 --> 01:09.835
- What made me?

01:09.837 --> 01:13.539
Here, follow
the trail of cookies.

01:13.541 --> 01:14.339
- We're going.
- No.

01:14.341 --> 01:15.507
- Yes, come on.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.176
I want to wear
my new red dress.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.445
Here, and you should just
pick something from there, okay?

01:21.081 --> 01:22.281
- I pick him.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.482
You can go with him.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.683
- Now, why don't
you want to go?

01:24.685 --> 01:25.717
- 'cause I just--

01:25.719 --> 01:26.819
- What?
What is it?

01:26.821 --> 01:28.420
I mean, come on,
you're a big success.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.588
You have this dream job,

01:29.590 --> 01:31.490
A beautiful home,
a terrific family.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.425
It's just a great life.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.428
- That's your spin on it.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.797
- And you know what else?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.499
You still have
all your hair,

01:40.501 --> 01:43.368
And it's still very thick.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.138
- It is very luxurious, raymond.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.445
- I don't know.

01:53.447 --> 01:57.683
I don't--you know.

01:57.685 --> 01:58.817
All right,
we'll stop by.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.486
- Okay, great, great.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.221
Go, go,
go get the kids now.

02:06.259 --> 02:08.260
- He uses conditioner,
doesn't he?

02:09.562 --> 02:11.196
And he tops it off
with the volumizer?

02:17.537 --> 02:20.539
[disco music plays]

02:24.878 --> 02:25.844
- We're not gonna
stay too long, okay?

02:25.846 --> 02:27.546
- Oh, all right,
yes, yes.

02:27.548 --> 02:30.682
- Wait a minute,
that guy's got hair.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.851
That guy's got hair.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.419
You promised me
bald people.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.420
- Yeah, yeah.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.420
Look, look, look.

02:36.422 --> 02:38.157
"the eagles return
to the nest."

02:38.159 --> 02:39.424
- Hmm, yeah.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.759
We were the eagles.

02:40.761 --> 02:44.429
Now, where are
the bald eagles?

02:44.431 --> 02:45.797
Hey, wait.
Oh, man.

02:45.799 --> 02:46.797
- What?
Who's that?

02:46.799 --> 02:48.467
- I went to high school
with that guy.

02:50.703 --> 02:52.237
- What are the odds, huh?

02:52.239 --> 02:53.539
- Oh, that's--

02:53.541 --> 02:54.540
Yeah, we're here.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.574
Yeah, okay.

Hey, I was reading
my yearbook before,

03:08.722 --> 03:10.355
And I want you to know
that I do remember

03:10.357 --> 03:11.623
The good times
in study hall,

03:11.625 --> 03:14.493
And I did have
an excellent summer.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.362
- Right,
I wrote that in his book.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.198
Scott and I, we hung out
a lot in high school.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.198
Oh, man.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.335
- Hey, you remember when
the egg mcmuffin came out?

03:23.337 --> 03:25.504
We snuck out of school
and got, like, three of them.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.739
- Yeah, yeah.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.775
Yeah, that was--

03:29.777 --> 03:30.943
Aw, that was--

03:30.945 --> 03:33.312
That was wild,
that was wild.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.580

03:34.582 --> 03:35.914
- Oh, he was crazy.

03:35.916 --> 03:36.949
- What?
- Yes!

03:36.951 --> 03:38.250
What?

03:38.252 --> 03:39.851
- One time,
we went to mcdonald's.

03:39.853 --> 03:43.655
He walked through
the drive-thru.

03:43.657 --> 03:44.756
Here's him, he's like,

03:44.758 --> 03:46.558
"honk honk!
Hey, hurry it up!

03:46.560 --> 03:48.293
It's taking too long!"

03:48.295 --> 03:50.295
Right?
[laughs]

03:50.297 --> 03:52.231
- It was so the girl
in the window would look at me.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.699
- Uh-huh.
Did she look at you?

03:53.701 --> 03:56.401
- Not the way I planned it.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.903
You remember that, huh?

03:57.905 --> 03:58.904
- Uh-oh.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.306
Bald eagle, 3:00.

04:01.308 --> 04:02.474
- Hey, red baron.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.809

white lightning.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.310

04:05.312 --> 04:06.912

04:06.914 --> 04:07.913
And that was their handle.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.348
- What was your handle, huh?

04:09.350 --> 04:11.383
- Hey, warren,

- Yeah.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.738
Oh, this was great.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.806
We used to talk to her
all the time on the c.B.,

04:34.808 --> 04:36.008
And then one night,

04:36.010 --> 04:37.709
We arranged to
meet up with her.

04:37.711 --> 04:40.479
- Yeah, and we pull into the
parking lot of hojo's, right?

04:40.481 --> 04:41.980
- We were in
the parking lot,

04:41.982 --> 04:44.950
And foxy lady, turns out it's
mrs. Drayer from the cafeteria.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.786
[laughter]

04:47.788 --> 04:48.854
She was the lunch lady.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.055

04:50.057 --> 04:51.823
- Yeah, ray wanted
to moon her.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.560

05:15.482 --> 05:19.084
We all went into

05:19.086 --> 05:20.719
- Yeah, I remember
we were pushed in.

05:20.721 --> 05:21.720
- That's right,

05:21.722 --> 05:23.055
Pete hastings

05:23.057 --> 05:24.556
Holds the door shut,

05:24.558 --> 05:25.957
And you were crying.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.027
[laughter]

05:29.029 --> 05:31.029
- Yeah, well, scott cried
during the sats

05:31.031 --> 05:32.798
When he skipped
a question by mistake,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.499
And all his answers
were off by one.

05:34.501 --> 05:35.534
- Yeah!
[laughs]

05:35.536 --> 05:36.868
- That wasn't funny, okay?

05:36.870 --> 05:39.504
I had to go to
community college.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.806
- Yeah, yeah.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.108
But you cried.
[laughs]

05:43.110 --> 05:44.443

you talked to her!

06:12.106 --> 06:15.674
- She smells
different now.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.409
- Hey, ray,

06:17.411 --> 06:19.544
Didn't you have bio class
with her junior year?

06:19.546 --> 06:20.545
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

06:20.547 --> 06:21.713
We had dissection.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.014
I pinned her frog open.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.083
- Oh.

06:27.755 --> 06:28.787

06:28.789 --> 06:30.021

06:30.023 --> 06:32.090
For burlington hosiery.

06:32.092 --> 06:35.127
Oh, socks
and sock-related items.

06:35.129 --> 06:36.928
- Oh, good.
That's cool.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.730
I guess the hardest
part of that

06:38.732 --> 06:40.465
Is getting your foot
in the door.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.535
[laughter]

06:43.537 --> 06:45.070
- I'm going to use that

- Take it.
Use it.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.171

06:47.173 --> 06:48.874
You still got that
comic book store?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.542
- Nah, it burned down.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.512
Now I'm studying
to be a rabbi.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.147
It's so friggin' hard.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.752
Hey, can we not
talk about work?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.753
- All right.
Don't cry.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.555
- So, you guys having fun?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.589

07:04.591 --> 07:05.589
- Oh, that's great.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.659
Listen, ray, I met a girl
that was in your class.

07:07.661 --> 07:09.027
She said we should
go sit at their table.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.562
- Yeah?
Okay.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.830

He was in our class.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.476
- Hey.
- Hi, ray.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.981
- I thought ray barone
died in a car wreck

08:02.983 --> 08:04.549
Right after graduation.

08:04.551 --> 08:06.084
- Yeah.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.552
- No!

08:10.189 --> 08:13.124
That was jay malone.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.527
- Oh, jay malone,
yeah, yeah.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.196
Hey, now,
he was a great guy.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.197
Here's to jay.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.198
- To jay.
- To jay.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.633
Wish you were here.

08:23.870 --> 08:25.904
- Oh, deb, you got to
come look at these pictures.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.639
You want to see what my hair
looked like 20 years ago?

08:27.641 --> 08:28.640
- Oh, yeah,
like farrah?

08:28.642 --> 08:29.641
I was dorothy hamill.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.277
[laughter]

08:32.279 --> 08:33.812
- Where you going?
- I'll be right back.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.846
Be right back.

08:34.848 --> 08:35.981
- This is wild, huh?

08:35.983 --> 08:37.716
- Hey, ray.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.084
You're not bobby barone's
brother, are you?

08:39.086 --> 08:40.519
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.720
- Great basketball player.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.256
What's he doing now?
- He's a cop.

08:44.258 --> 08:47.192
- Wow, that's great.
- Yeah.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.192
I'm a sportswriter.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.662
I got a column
in "newsday" now.

08:54.834 --> 08:55.834
- Oh, wait a minute.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.769
Ray barone.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.738
Now I know who you are.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.007
I used to throw you in
the girls' room all the time.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.576
You remember that?
- Yeah.

09:04.578 --> 09:05.610
Thanks.

09:05.612 --> 09:06.611
So how are you?

09:06.613 --> 09:10.081
["funky town" plays]

09:10.083 --> 09:12.050
- Here we go.
- Oh, I love this song.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.050
- Do you remember
the freak?

09:13.052 --> 09:14.920
- Yeah, yeah, and the hustle.
Oh, the bump.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.589
- The bump.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.224
- Hey, jessica,
come on, you ready?

09:19.226 --> 09:20.225
Oh, let's go.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.225
- Come on, ray,
let's boogie.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.828
- No, no, no, weddings only.
You know that.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.263
- Oh, come on.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.198
- Ray, you're not gonna dance?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.199
Would you like
to dance?

09:28.201 --> 09:30.135
- Oh, do you mind?
- Sure.

09:30.137 --> 09:32.203
- Great, thanks.
- Go, uh, boogie.

10:23.889 --> 10:25.824
- [singing]♪
shake, shake, shake

10:25.826 --> 10:27.659
Shake, shake, shake

10:27.661 --> 10:28.693
Shake your booty

10:29.895 --> 10:31.696
Shake your booty♪

10:31.698 --> 10:33.765
- All right!
- What?

10:33.767 --> 10:36.234
- Enough booty.

10:36.236 --> 10:39.204
- Oh, it was so much fun.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.006
Boy, I just love dancing,
you know?

10:41.008 --> 10:42.707
- Hey, this just in:

10:42.709 --> 10:46.111
Disco sucks.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.312
- What, you didn't
have a good time?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.713
Your friends are great.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.882
Those people
aren't my friends.

10:50.884 --> 10:53.385
- Who, pete and jessica
and chris and steve

10:53.387 --> 10:54.185
And wendy and jodie?

10:56.889 --> 10:58.823
- What's wrong with them?
- What's wrong with them?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.392
They used to throw me
into the girls' room.

11:00.394 --> 11:03.161
- Oh, well,
they're very nice now.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.696
- Yeah, to you.

11:04.698 --> 11:05.864
- What?

11:05.866 --> 11:07.065
- To you.

11:07.067 --> 11:10.135
To you, they're nice.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.671
You're one of 'em.

11:12.673 --> 11:13.905
- What do you mean,
"I'm one of them"?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.441
- You know.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.909
Popular.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.246
- Ray, what's the matter?

11:21.248 --> 11:23.248
What, are you mad at me
for having a good time?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.916
You could've
had a good time.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.151
I asked you to dance.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.719
- I don't like dancing.

11:27.721 --> 11:29.154
- Yeah, but I do.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.288
- Yeah, I know that.
I know.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.825
The whole class of '77
knows that.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.126
- Well, forgive me,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.861
But I'm not afraid
to have a little bit of fun.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.830
- Well, what a snobby,
shallow, superficial,

11:38.832 --> 11:39.831
Popular thing to say.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.203
- Okay, I'm trying
to understand this.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.371
You didn't like
our table.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.706
Where did you
want to sit?

11:47.708 --> 11:50.775
- On our couch at home.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.011
- And you're wondering why you
weren't one of the popular kids.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.313
Ray, this is why
I wanted to go to your reunion,

11:55.315 --> 11:57.215
'cause you never
want to go anywhere.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.483
- Well, you know something?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.719
There's something
really wrong with somebody

12:00.721 --> 12:02.787
Who has to be popular
at somebody else's reunion.

12:03.956 --> 12:05.457
- You are such a nerd.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.092
- Aha!

12:07.094 --> 12:08.727
Aha!
I knew it!

12:08.729 --> 12:11.730
You think I'm a nerd!

12:11.732 --> 12:12.730
- Yeah, yeah!

12:12.732 --> 12:14.432
You know what you are?
A cheerleader!

12:14.434 --> 12:15.800
Cheerleader!

12:15.802 --> 12:17.402
- Go put in
your retainer!

12:17.404 --> 12:19.337
God!

12:19.339 --> 12:21.406
- I'm going to bed, or...

12:21.408 --> 12:23.041
Here, let me
translate that for you.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.309
Gimme a "b!"

12:24.311 --> 12:25.844
Gimme an "e!"

12:25.846 --> 12:27.312
Gimme a "d!"

12:27.314 --> 12:30.281
What's that spell?
What's that spell?

12:40.226 --> 12:43.828
Hey, hey, no mtv
in this house.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.130
What are you--

12:45.132 --> 12:46.131
Give me that.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.067
Here. Popeye.

12:49.069 --> 12:51.536
Popeye's great.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.505
- Nobody likes popeye.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.406
- Why,
'cause he's not cool?

12:59.145 --> 13:01.312
Maybe you don't know popeye.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.081
Don't be so quick
to judge.

13:04.450 --> 13:07.085
Nobody likes popeye.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.953
Yeah.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.188
Till bluto's
got you in a headlock.

13:10.190 --> 13:14.325
Then--then what?

13:14.327 --> 13:15.927
Guy hangs out
with wimpy and...

13:32.011 --> 13:35.079
Hee hee!

13:37.383 --> 13:39.984
Monster tattoo.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.319
Just wanted to see
what it looked like.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.320
That's not nerdy.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.122
- I didn't say a thing.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.925
Listen, I, uh...

13:46.927 --> 13:49.394
Washed your gym stuff.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.497
Your nose plugs
went through the dryer.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.966
- Dr. Sundram said
I have to wear those

13:54.968 --> 13:56.868
To prevent infections
in my eustachian tubes.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.603
- Yes, ray.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.106
We all know
you have sensitive tubes.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.577
- What's the matter,
it's not cool enough for you?

14:05.579 --> 14:08.580
What's a big medical problem
with you, ruptured booty?

14:08.582 --> 14:10.615
- [giggles]

14:10.617 --> 14:13.451
No, I never
ruptured my booty.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.420
One time I did sprain
my groove thang.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.456
- Hey.
- Hey, robert.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.225
- So how was last night?

14:20.227 --> 14:21.593
- Oh, yeah,
it was great.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.329
Listen, a lot of people
at the reunion asked about you.

14:24.331 --> 14:25.930
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.065
Remember jessica bell?

14:27.067 --> 14:29.234
- Ah, little jessica.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.002
Used to follow me around.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.503
Good kid.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.138
- You know,
I think she liked you.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.306
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.307
- Her friends
asked my friends

14:36.309 --> 14:38.643
To ask me
to ask her out.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.445
- You went out
with jessica bell?

14:40.447 --> 14:42.881
- No, no.
She was a freshman.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.515
That would've been like
me hanging out with...

14:44.517 --> 14:45.316
You.

14:48.020 --> 14:49.320
- Oh, pete hastings, too.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.222
- Ah, tough guy, right?
- Yeah.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.657
- Yeah, I remember him.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.259
Got wise with me once.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.326
I pushed him
in the girls' room.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.997
You know what you do?

14:58.999 --> 15:00.598
You hold the door closed
so they can't get out.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.598
- I know, I know.

15:01.600 --> 15:03.368
- Have you heard about it?
Yeah, yeah.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.469
So you had fun,
right, huh?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.237
Come on,
it was a good time, huh?

15:07.907 --> 15:08.907
- Don't ask me;
ask her.

15:08.909 --> 15:10.642
She's the dancing queen.

15:10.644 --> 15:11.643
- Really?

15:11.645 --> 15:13.311
Do the hustle.

15:13.313 --> 15:17.515
[humming "the hustle"]

15:17.517 --> 15:19.250
- Cut it out!

15:19.252 --> 15:20.952
Stop it!

15:20.954 --> 15:21.953
- Whoo!

15:21.955 --> 15:24.355
- Cut it out!
Stop it!

15:24.357 --> 15:26.357
Stop it!
Stop it!

15:26.359 --> 15:28.526
Stop it!
Stop it!

15:31.597 --> 15:32.597
- Wow!

15:32.599 --> 15:35.333
Robert,
you've got the moves!

15:35.335 --> 15:39.070
- Oh, I got
the music in me.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.205
- What you need's an indian
and a construction worker,

15:41.207 --> 15:42.006
And you got an act.

15:43.475 --> 15:44.976
- Sorry, robert.

15:44.978 --> 15:46.978
Ray's a little cranky
this morning.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.647
He was up too late watching
everybody else have fun.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.649
- I wasn't watching people
have fun, all right?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.051
I was keeping an eye
on the purses.

15:54.486 --> 15:56.087
- Pulling some nerd duty, huh?

15:56.089 --> 15:57.522
[debra laughs]

15:57.524 --> 15:58.690
- Come on, now, robert.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.258
Ray's as cool as any guy

16:00.260 --> 16:03.027
With a stick-on tattoo
and nose plugs.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.696
- [laughs]
nose plugs!

16:06.732 --> 16:09.133
- Hey, you know, some of us
aren't in high school.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.369
We've moved on, okay?

16:11.371 --> 16:12.370
Let me ask you,

16:12.372 --> 16:14.372
Does a nerdy guy go on the road

16:14.374 --> 16:17.275
With the new york knicks?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.110
- Depends if they need somebody
to watch the purses.

16:19.112 --> 16:22.113
- [laughs]

16:23.983 --> 16:25.049
- That's funny.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.117
Oh, that's very funny.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.752
Laugh.

16:27.754 --> 16:30.221
I don't care
what you guys think, okay?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.489
I know what I am.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.727
- Raymond, I got something
for you to try on.

16:35.729 --> 16:36.728
- What?

16:36.730 --> 16:38.463
- I saw these
in the catalog,

16:38.465 --> 16:41.032
And I thought
they looked jazzy.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.033
- [laughs]

16:42.035 --> 16:44.002
- Hey, ray, that's great.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.404
Your mom bought you
some short pants.

16:46.406 --> 16:48.706
- [nerdy voice]
very jazzy.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.742
- No, ma, I'm not wearing
these pants, okay?

16:50.744 --> 16:52.610
- Why not?
They're very with-it.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.345
- Hey, ray,
if the shorts fit.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.749
[laughter]

16:57.751 --> 17:00.018
- Yeah, you know what?
Maybe the shorts do fit.

17:01.653 --> 17:03.254
- What's the matter with you?

17:04.289 --> 17:05.490
You were very happy

17:05.492 --> 17:06.691
When I bought you those pajamas.

17:14.099 --> 17:15.199
- Are you okay?

17:16.602 --> 17:18.369
- Listen.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.304
Would you, uh...

17:20.306 --> 17:21.506
Maybe--I don't know,
would you...

17:23.375 --> 17:26.044
Would you--do you want to go
dancing Saturday night?

17:26.046 --> 17:28.780
- Dancing?
You and me?

17:28.782 --> 17:31.149
- Yeah, you know,
if you want.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.550
- Well, we can't Saturday,
but--

17:32.552 --> 17:35.653
- Okay, fine.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.288
- No, no, no,
but maybe some other time.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.557
- Yeah, yeah,
some other time.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.659
Hey, I've heard 'em all, okay?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.796
How about "I can't;
I'm washing my hair,"

17:44.798 --> 17:47.265
Or "I don't think of you
that way,"

17:47.267 --> 17:49.500
Or "I'm not allowed
to date italians"?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.569
Yeah, I get it, okay?

17:51.571 --> 17:52.570
I get it!

17:52.572 --> 17:54.305
I'm a dork!

17:54.307 --> 17:56.207
- Ray, I can't go dancing
with you Saturday

17:56.209 --> 17:58.176
Because you're gonna be
out of town with the knicks.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.244
- Oh, how convenient!

18:02.514 --> 18:04.515
- Ray, and I don't want you
to go dancing with me

18:04.517 --> 18:06.818
Just to prove to yourself
that you're not a dork.

18:06.820 --> 18:09.787
- Well, I don't know
how else to do it.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.222
This is a mixed marriage.

18:13.859 --> 18:16.260
- Hey, I was just
teasing you.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.862
What are you
so sensitive about?

18:17.864 --> 18:19.831
- Look, you're one of
the cool people, and...

18:21.800 --> 18:23.267
I'm not.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.473
- Then why did I
marry you?

18:28.475 --> 18:29.674
- That's right.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.142
Good question.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.376
- No, I'm asking you.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.578
Why do you think
I married you?

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
- I...

18:35.582 --> 18:37.415
I don't know.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.150
- Come on.

18:43.689 --> 18:44.689
- I'm nice.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.427
- Yes.
What else?

18:52.397 --> 18:55.233
- I have good hair.

18:55.235 --> 18:57.668
- Yes.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.506
- I have a car.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.708
- You have your own car?

19:03.710 --> 19:05.176
- Well, it's my father's,

19:05.178 --> 19:07.478
But I can get it
whenever I want.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.448
- Gee, how come I never see you
in the cafeteria?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.883
- 'cause my mom makes me
come home for lunch.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.152
- [laughs]

19:17.456 --> 19:18.756
Mmm, wow.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.492
You're a good kisser.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.327
- I'm a lot better
without the retainer.

19:26.265 --> 19:27.498
- You know what I'm thinking?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.699
- What?

19:28.701 --> 19:30.168
- You can't be such a dork

19:30.170 --> 19:31.836
If the cool girl's
about to sleep with you.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.704
- Jessica bell's
coming over?

19:33.706 --> 19:34.906
- Oh, stop it!

19:39.378 --> 19:40.378
- Okay.
You ready?

19:40.380 --> 19:41.579
I just--you know,

19:41.581 --> 19:43.214
I need a little tune-up,
that's all.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.448
- Okay, look,
just relax, all right?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.350
- Yeah, all right.

19:46.352 --> 19:47.518
["funky town" plays]

19:47.520 --> 19:49.554
Okay, now.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.688
Can you do this?

19:55.961 --> 19:57.628
Good, good.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.230
All right, okay,
now, how about this one?

20:03.435 --> 20:04.435
There you go.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.436
Loosen up.
Loosen up.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.904
Shake it up.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.573
That's it.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.709
That's it,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.844
- How about this?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.313
Let's work this in,
'cause I got this.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.380
I got this.

20:19.885 --> 20:20.985
- Where'd you learn that?

20:20.987 --> 20:21.986
- Church dance.

20:21.988 --> 20:22.987
- Okay, all right.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.355
Okay, okay, check this out.

20:31.897 --> 20:32.897
- I don't do that.
