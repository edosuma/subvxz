WEBVTT

00:00.686 --> 00:02.967
Okay, I got a meeting in half an hour,
so I better run.

00:02.977 --> 00:04.281
Okay, well, have a great day.

00:04.291 --> 00:05.888
- Thanks again for breakfast.
- My pleasure.

00:05.918 --> 00:07.263
You make a hell of a frittata.

00:07.273 --> 00:09.365
Well, it's ma specialty.
What time will you be home?

00:09.375 --> 00:10.550
Around 6:00-ish.

00:10.560 --> 00:12.279
All right,
I might make a frittata for dinner.

00:12.309 --> 00:13.413
Ooh, sounds good.

00:13.423 --> 00:15.511
- Have a great day, honey.
- Bye, hon.

00:16.658 --> 00:18.290
- So what'd you think?
- Frittata?

00:18.303 --> 00:20.301
- Felt pretty good, huh?
- No, it did.

00:20.317 --> 00:22.133
It's homey.
Home-ish. Home-like.

00:22.149 --> 00:23.372
Margaret, what did you think?

00:23.389 --> 00:25.262
You seemed like real
people in a real house.

00:25.278 --> 00:27.000
Wow. What about the lighting?

00:27.015 --> 00:30.502
Well, you can see there's lots of
windows, lots of natural sunlight.

00:30.515 --> 00:32.171
- But how do we look?
- Excuse me?

00:32.186 --> 00:33.633
In the lighting,
how do we look?

00:33.645 --> 00:36.423
Oh, right.
At least 10 years younger.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.003
- Than...
- Hmm?

00:38.018 --> 00:41.011
Well, if you think we're 60 and
the lighting makes us look 50,

00:41.026 --> 00:43.791
then this room is aging us,
and that's not good.

00:43.806 --> 00:45.783
- You look 20.
- Very good!

00:45.796 --> 00:48.300
This house was
originally built in 1790

00:48.317 --> 00:50.731
but obviously has been
completely remodeled.

00:50.746 --> 00:53.082
All new appliances.
three fireplaces.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.582
Proximity to an excellent
school district.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.520
The large backyard.
Great tree-house-building trees.

00:58.535 --> 00:59.453
Ooh, fun.

00:59.467 --> 01:01.151
So I'm gonna make a quick call.

01:01.168 --> 01:03.850
Take your time. Look around.
Make yourselves at home.

01:03.868 --> 01:06.212
Well, I don't have to
tell you two that.

01:06.228 --> 01:08.713
I'll be right outside, so just
holler if you have any questions.

01:08.747 --> 01:10.220
Thank you. We will.

01:10.295 --> 01:12.101
- So...
- So?

01:12.118 --> 01:14.350
- I told you it was a really cool house.
- It is.

01:14.368 --> 01:16.273
- And that yard?
- Oh, love the yard.

01:16.287 --> 01:18.990
And I know it's not Stars Hollow,
but it's a really cool town.

01:19.007 --> 01:21.172
And bigger.
Lots of places to eat and shop.

01:21.187 --> 01:23.722
Three bookstores?
I mean, this is a well-read community.

01:23.737 --> 01:25.220
We might be the
dumbest people in town.

01:25.255 --> 01:27.761
Yeah, we could be the town dunces.
We'll buy caps.

01:27.776 --> 01:29.633
We'll put "The Dunces"
on our mailbox.

01:29.645 --> 01:30.693
That mailbox!

01:30.706 --> 01:32.883
What is that,
a hollowed-out birch tree or something?

01:32.897 --> 01:35.100
The second-floor bedroom --
that's perfect for G.G.

01:35.117 --> 01:37.141
And the third-floor room,
the one with the really cool windows --

01:37.178 --> 01:38.233
that could be Rory's room.

01:38.245 --> 01:40.453
Honey, I can't imagine
a better house.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.121
Big front yard.

01:45.858 --> 01:47.251
Could be our front yard.

01:47.266 --> 01:49.573
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:51.906 --> 01:53.273
What's with the face?

01:53.287 --> 01:55.951
Face? What face? It's my face.
You don't like my face?

01:56.088 --> 01:58.000
- Lor.
- Hmm?

01:58.377 --> 02:00.500
You want to stay
in Stars Hollow.

02:01.376 --> 02:02.581
Yeah.

02:02.906 --> 02:05.952
You want to stay in your house.
You don't want to move at all.

02:06.098 --> 02:07.310
Yeah.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.032
Okay.

02:10.098 --> 02:11.780
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

02:12.547 --> 02:14.871
- It's a hell of a mailbox, though.
- Sure is.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.636 --> 03:14.092
- You're here.
- I'm here!

03:14.106 --> 03:16.130
You're 37 minutes late,
but you're here.

03:16.145 --> 03:17.330
Uh, traffic.

03:17.348 --> 03:19.352
It's sunday morning, Lorelai.
The roads are empty.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.012
Will you let me finish, mom?
Traffic cones everywhere.

03:22.025 --> 03:24.403
I mean, you wouldn't believe it. It's
like a crazy obstacle course out there.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.752
It's a miracle I survived.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.192
Maybe we should do
this another day

03:27.206 --> 03:29.211
when I'm less stressed from
the traffic-cone dodging.

03:29.247 --> 03:31.232
I have the most exciting news.

03:31.247 --> 03:32.541
You're canceling
my wedding party?

03:32.576 --> 03:35.173
I got Randall Farber
as your party planner.

03:35.188 --> 03:36.522
He's canceling my
wedding party?

03:36.537 --> 03:39.091
He spent the last 15 years
as designer-in-residence

03:39.107 --> 03:40.470
at the Connecticut Opera House.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.143
Boss.

03:41.157 --> 03:43.150
This  is a real coup, Lorelai.

03:43.167 --> 03:45.302
Your father and I have been
fans of his work for years,

03:45.335 --> 03:47.493
and he's only just
begun designing parties.

03:47.505 --> 03:50.783
Two months ago, we went to Abigail
Hirschfeld's granddaughter's bat mitzvah,

03:50.797 --> 03:53.351
and it was the most
spectacular event.

03:53.368 --> 03:57.082
The whole decor was inspired by
Britten's "A Midsummer Night's Dream."

03:57.095 --> 04:00.853
I swear I felt like I was in an
enchanted forest the entire night,

04:00.868 --> 04:02.972
except for the children
running around with braces.

04:02.986 --> 04:05.441
Randall, this is my
daughter, Lorelai.

04:05.457 --> 04:07.732
Lorelai, Randall Farber.

04:07.746 --> 04:09.763
- Hello.
- Ah, the star of our show.

04:09.778 --> 04:10.902
Oh, well...

04:10.918 --> 04:13.651
I apologize for her tardiness.
It's rather habitual.

04:13.666 --> 04:15.310
Oh, stop.
You're talking to an opera man.

04:15.328 --> 04:16.981
I've worked with RenÃ©e Fleming.

04:16.998 --> 04:19.041
The personality of a pit bull,
that one,

04:19.055 --> 04:21.491
but all is forgiven when she sings,
am I right?

04:21.507 --> 04:24.260
Well, heads-up, I'm not much of
an outside-the-shower singer.

04:24.276 --> 04:27.222
I hope you realize how lucky you
are to have Randall, Lorelai.

04:27.237 --> 04:29.422
- He's a genius.
- Oh, stop.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.371
Shall we?

04:30.387 --> 04:31.540
Please.

04:31.888 --> 04:34.532
The first order of business
is deciding on a theme

04:34.547 --> 04:36.951
around which I can
design the evening.

04:36.968 --> 04:38.840
How about "Man's
inhumanity to man"?

04:38.857 --> 04:41.133
It always worked well for my
term papers in high school.

04:41.148 --> 04:42.490
Why don't you show us
what you're thinking?

04:42.525 --> 04:45.120
I've done a few mock-up tables.
Just tell me which one

04:45.137 --> 04:47.893
- jumps out at you.
- Um, they all jump out at me.

04:47.905 --> 04:49.603
- Kind of aggressively.
- Lorelai.

04:49.618 --> 04:51.900
Well, I just don't want it
to be a big production, mom.

04:51.918 --> 04:52.830
It's just a party.

04:52.848 --> 04:55.222
My dear,
every party's a production.

04:55.238 --> 04:57.210
If it's a lousy production,
it's a lousy party

04:57.228 --> 04:59.022
and everyone leaves by 8:30.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.803
What about that as a theme?

05:00.817 --> 05:02.733
"Everyone leaves by 8:30."

05:02.747 --> 05:04.373
Tell me about this one.

05:05.008 --> 05:08.140
You've got your stoking plant,
your festive ornament collage,

05:08.155 --> 05:10.631
your snowman trio,
your peekaboo Santa.

05:10.648 --> 05:13.353
Well, it's lovely, Kirk,
but I already bought my wrapping paper

05:13.365 --> 05:15.452
from the kids from the
Stars Hollow middle school.

05:15.466 --> 05:17.412
- Well, then, you got ripped off. 
- What?

05:17.428 --> 05:18.742
Those kids are gouging you.

05:18.758 --> 05:21.461
I'm selling the same
wrapping paper for 20% less.

05:21.475 --> 05:22.920
Aren't the kids selling
the wrapping paper

05:22.957 --> 05:25.043
to help raise money
for a new gymnasium?

05:25.058 --> 05:26.522
- Yeah.
- Well, why are you?

05:26.537 --> 05:28.313
To  raise money for myself.

05:28.335 --> 05:31.113
I'm not a school, Luke.
No one's raising money for me.

05:31.128 --> 05:33.803
I saw the opportunity to enter
the market at a lower price point

05:33.818 --> 05:36.050
- and I took it.
- Ho, ho, ho.

05:36.068 --> 05:39.132
What,  schoolchildren are the only
ones allowed to sell wrapping paper?

05:39.148 --> 05:40.290
It's a free country.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.940
Hey, Jacob! Beat it.
This is my territory.

05:42.955 --> 05:43.791
Fathead.

05:43.907 --> 05:45.833
Yeah, keep walking.

05:47.205 --> 05:50.463
- Look who's here.
- Oh, my god!

05:50.478 --> 05:52.022
She's precious.

05:52.036 --> 05:55.833
Oh, those eyes, that skin --
she's gorgeous.

05:55.848 --> 05:57.691
That's what everyone says.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.491
- Hey, Liz.
- Hi, Luke.

05:59.506 --> 06:00.780
Oh, she's bigger.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.310
- 11 pounds, 4 ounces.
- She looks great.

06:03.327 --> 06:05.090
I know.
She's really strong, too.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.251
She can practically
hold her head up.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.123
Most kids don't do that
until they're two months.

06:09.159 --> 06:09.952
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.022
- Come on over and sit down.
- Oh, sure.

06:13.967 --> 06:17.281
She's really strong, too.
She takes after T.J.

06:17.295 --> 06:19.053
He's really strong, you know.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.123
We've been watching "Survivor"
sometimes, you know,

06:21.135 --> 06:23.440
and he does the challenges,
you know,

06:23.457 --> 06:27.091
like standing on one leg or
dragging the sandbags around,

06:27.107 --> 06:29.423
and he lasts longer than
the guys on the show.

06:29.436 --> 06:30.052
Wow.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.191
You know,
baby's first Christmas is approaching.

06:32.207 --> 06:36.121
Have you given thought to what baby's
first Christmas gift will be wrapped in?

06:36.136 --> 06:36.963
No.

06:36.978 --> 06:40.530
I have baby Santa,
cuddly reindeers, Frosty's world --

06:40.548 --> 06:41.541
Kirk.

06:41.646 --> 06:42.962
Yeah, okay.

06:43.265 --> 06:46.281
So is April excited
about being a cousin?

06:46.296 --> 06:47.832
Yeah. I showed her
the pictures you sent

06:47.867 --> 06:50.590
and she's gonna frame the one
of her in the orange jumper.

06:50.606 --> 06:52.830
Oh, that is such a good one!

06:52.876 --> 06:55.240
She looks like a
little creamsicle.

06:55.655 --> 06:58.393
- She's very photogenic, huh?
- Yeah.

06:58.468 --> 07:00.121
And how are things with Anna?

07:00.135 --> 07:02.420
We're trading calls.
It'll work out.

07:02.435 --> 07:05.230
I mean, I've calmed down
a little since the fight.

07:05.248 --> 07:07.470
It'll all work itself out.

07:07.488 --> 07:08.500
I'm sure.

07:08.517 --> 07:11.062
Actually, I made a list.

07:11.285 --> 07:13.382
I think it's pretty reasonable.

07:13.656 --> 07:17.593
I was thinking I could have April
either Thanksgiving or Christmas --

07:17.607 --> 07:18.810
Anna can choose.

07:18.827 --> 07:20.161
One month of the summer.

07:20.175 --> 07:23.190
And I think I would like
April to come to Stars Hollow

07:23.205 --> 07:25.120
one weekend every other month.

07:25.138 --> 07:27.632
In between,
I can travel to New Mexico.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.002
That sounds fair, right?

07:29.016 --> 07:30.310
Very reasonable.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.680
But I definitely think
you need to get a lawyer.

07:32.696 --> 07:33.840
No lawyers.

07:33.855 --> 07:36.111
Anna and I are gonna work
this out on our own.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.850
That's what you think now,
big brother, but trust me --

07:38.867 --> 07:41.021
custody issues are tough.

07:41.037 --> 07:42.883
Well, I don't like lawyers.

07:42.898 --> 07:44.413
Well, nobody does.

07:44.427 --> 07:47.661
Wait. She's staring at you.
She is!

07:47.678 --> 07:51.761
She's staring at you,
and she's falling asleep.

07:51.776 --> 07:54.470
Great. I'm gonna
leave her with you,

07:54.488 --> 07:56.480
and I'll be back in an hour.

07:56.498 --> 07:59.040
- What?
- Oh, I'm going crazy.

07:59.058 --> 08:01.452
- I just need a minute to myself.
- Liz...

08:01.465 --> 08:03.503
She's been attached to
my boob for two weeks,

08:03.515 --> 08:06.512
and T.J.'s decided to
finally get a "work ethic."

08:06.526 --> 08:08.290
You can't just leave her here.
I can't watch her.

08:08.328 --> 08:10.111
I fed her. She'll be fine.

08:10.126 --> 08:11.490
She'll sleep the whole time.

08:11.506 --> 08:13.441
- Wait, Liz --
- I'll be back in an hour,

08:13.456 --> 08:14.812
maybe an hour and a half.

08:20.175 --> 08:23.883
So why don't we take
our inspiration from

08:24.158 --> 08:26.780
the world of "La BohÃ¨me,"

08:26.796 --> 08:28.731
fin de siÃ¨cle Paris?

08:28.745 --> 08:32.539
A little birdie told me you had quite
the romantic parisian adventure.

08:32.556 --> 08:33.743
Tweet, tweet.

08:33.755 --> 08:36.793
I must confess --
this is my personal favorite.

08:36.806 --> 08:38.580
I  must admit I
have a soft spot,

08:38.596 --> 08:41.642
for it was while I was doing "La
BohÃ¨me" at the Staatsoper in Vienna

08:41.657 --> 08:44.651
that I met the incomparable
Franco Zeffirelli,

08:44.665 --> 08:47.002
whose meticulous
attention to detail

08:47.015 --> 08:49.653
has been a yardstick for
which I measure all my work.

08:49.667 --> 08:52.361
Your details are simply
astounding, Randall.

08:52.376 --> 08:55.252
What about instead of "La BohÃ¨me," we
took our inspiration from "Rent" --

08:55.286 --> 08:57.322
East Village, 1985,

08:57.335 --> 08:59.992
rickety tables,
chipped glassware...

09:00.008 --> 09:01.973
- Lorelai.
- Excuse me.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.070
Hello?

09:03.085 --> 09:04.521
How goes the party planning?

09:04.535 --> 09:06.722
What? What happened?

09:06.737 --> 09:09.122
- That good, huh?
- Is he okay?

09:09.136 --> 09:10.872
I'm not participating in this.

09:10.886 --> 09:13.530
Oh, my god. What can I do?
What do you need?

09:13.547 --> 09:16.170
You're not using this phone call
to get out of party-planning hell.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.053
Oh, I'll be right there.

09:18.065 --> 09:18.910
Mom!

09:18.927 --> 09:20.883
I can hear Rory on the
other end, Lorelai.

09:20.897 --> 09:22.400
You're not as clever
as you think you are.

09:22.435 --> 09:23.231
You rat.

09:23.246 --> 09:25.520
- Hi, grandma.
- Hello, Rory.

09:25.535 --> 09:27.773
That's my granddaughter, Rory.
Delightful girl.

09:27.788 --> 09:30.792
- She's a senior at Yale.
- Fantastic theater program --

09:30.808 --> 09:32.311
Meryl, Jodie.

09:32.326 --> 09:34.960
- Uh, I thought we had a deal.
- We had no deal.

09:34.977 --> 09:37.831
No, a deal for life.
You've got my back. I've got yours.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.212
I plan on having a good
time at your wedding party.

09:40.225 --> 09:41.583
More importantly,
I plan on making sure

09:41.615 --> 09:43.353
that you have a good time
at your wedding party.

09:43.388 --> 09:45.751
Therefore, I think it's important
that you be involved in the planning

09:45.788 --> 09:48.192
of your wedding party,
so in the big picture,

09:48.205 --> 09:50.101
I do very much have your back.

09:50.116 --> 09:51.261
Yeah, whatever.

09:51.776 --> 09:53.391
Okay. Bad news.

09:53.406 --> 09:56.032
I'm afraid I have to bail on
you and dad for dinner tonight.

09:56.045 --> 09:57.651
Mm-hmm. Logan?

09:57.667 --> 09:59.870
Yeah, he's coming to stay
with me for a couple days.

09:59.885 --> 10:02.703
He's been so busy with the start-up,
I've hardly gotten to see him lately.

10:02.718 --> 10:05.050
Okay. Can't see you through the phone,
but I'm pouting.

10:05.067 --> 10:07.081
- I'll make it up to you.
- Is he coming to the party?

10:07.116 --> 10:10.183
I'm trying to pat the guest list.
If he's coming, I'm in the double digits.

10:10.198 --> 10:12.112
- He'll be there.
- Awesome.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.953
So okay,
I'll call you later, okay?

10:13.965 --> 10:17.233
The stairs are rickety,
and you think you might fall down them?

10:17.245 --> 10:18.103
Mom.

10:18.116 --> 10:20.710
The pool is empty,
and you've hit your head?

10:20.725 --> 10:22.553
- Goodbye.
- Okay, bye.

10:22.565 --> 10:25.001
Lorelai, come look at
these invitations.

10:26.695 --> 10:28.502
Can we just send an evite?

10:28.747 --> 10:30.560
No? Okay.

10:34.806 --> 10:37.762
Two hours we spent
picking out invitations.

10:37.778 --> 10:39.140
- Two hours.
- Wow.

10:39.156 --> 10:42.770
Not counting the one hour we spent
picking out the calligraphy -- for
a party.

10:42.786 --> 10:44.300
This is gonna be some shindig.

10:44.317 --> 10:47.512
"Would you like the brown card 
with the cream-colored detail

10:47.526 --> 10:50.742
and the parchment insert, or 
would you like the cream-colored card

10:50.758 --> 10:53.381
with the silk lining and
the clear paper insert?"

10:53.396 --> 10:55.022
How about I'd like some cyanide

10:55.035 --> 10:57.341
and a 30-story building
to jump off of?

10:57.355 --> 10:59.743
No, we said one sugar cereal.

10:59.758 --> 11:00.840
You're gonna deny
me the captain?

11:00.877 --> 11:02.513
We've got a whole box
of Froot Loops at home.

11:02.548 --> 11:05.390
With my fragile state,you're gonna
deny me peanut butter Cap'n Crunch?

11:05.408 --> 11:08.421
-  It rips your gums...
- In a delightful, sugary way.

11:08.437 --> 11:11.251
Look, it's got 5% real
peanut-butter-flavored chemicals.

11:11.266 --> 11:13.501
- No.
- Oh, fine. Corn flakes.

11:13.516 --> 11:14.753
Which one do we get again?

11:14.805 --> 11:16.931
Avoid the words "made
with real vegetables."

11:16.945 --> 11:19.581
I cannot take another
day of Emily and Randall,

11:19.596 --> 11:21.401
and I have nine
more days of it.

11:21.417 --> 11:23.041
That's nine more days
than I can take.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.222
Oh, you're doing great.

11:24.238 --> 11:26.462
I'm not doing great.
I'm going nuts.

11:26.475 --> 11:30.580
Tomorrow we have the food-and-wine
tasting at the Mildred Manor ballroom.

11:30.598 --> 11:32.490
Well at least you get to
drink your way through it.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.233
No. Fancy people make
you spit out the wine.

11:35.248 --> 11:37.360
That's what fancy people do.
But not me.

11:37.378 --> 11:38.613
I'm gonna drink them
under the ballroom.

11:38.645 --> 11:41.113
- What time's the tasting?
- 3:30 till the end of never.

11:41.126 --> 11:44.120
I've got a meeting in Hartford at 2:00,
but I can meet you there afterward.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.842
- Really?
- Yes.

11:45.858 --> 11:47.440
Honey, that would be so great.

11:47.457 --> 11:50.400
I will never eat peanut butter Cap'n
Crunch again. Yes, I will. That's a lie.

11:50.437 --> 11:52.521
But together,
we can defeat them.

11:52.535 --> 11:55.483
This is serious. I don't want to get
the wrong-colored parchment insert.

11:55.497 --> 11:57.640
The guys at the gym would
never let me live it down.

11:57.656 --> 11:59.510
- We got everything?
- Yeah, we're good.

11:59.935 --> 12:01.223
- Oh, no.
- What?

12:01.237 --> 12:02.512
- Bonnie.
- Who?

12:02.527 --> 12:04.501
Taylor's niece, Bonnie,
working the register.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.523
She couldn't be slower or
care less about her job.

12:06.537 --> 12:08.751
I thought life in a small town
was supposed to be leisurely.

12:08.788 --> 12:10.971
There's leisurely,
and then there's Bonnie.

12:12.327 --> 12:13.833
We're never gonna
get out of here.

12:13.847 --> 12:15.053
Go wait outside.

12:15.065 --> 12:16.452
- Really?
- Go.

12:18.985 --> 12:21.311
Honey, buy me Tic Tacs.
Hi, Bonnie.

12:21.326 --> 12:22.693
What's up, Lorelai?

12:23.717 --> 12:25.431
That's cabbage, hon.

12:28.967 --> 12:31.221
I'm gonna need a void here.

12:35.007 --> 12:36.493
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:36.848 --> 12:39.001
- Who's -- who's this?
- That's Liz's baby.

12:39.015 --> 12:42.281
Oh, wow. Congratulations.
You're an uncle again, huh?

12:42.298 --> 12:43.200
Yeah, thanks.

12:43.216 --> 12:45.873
Oh. Well, she's cute.

12:45.888 --> 12:47.810
She looks just like T.J.

12:47.827 --> 12:49.662
Hopefully she will
grow out of that.

12:49.677 --> 12:51.990
Oh, she's adorable.
She's sweet.

12:52.008 --> 12:54.290
- So what's her name?
- Doula.

12:54.397 --> 12:55.873
- What?
- Doula.

12:55.885 --> 12:57.453
- Oh, is that...
- A weird name.

12:57.468 --> 13:01.122
Weird name. A little bit.
But, no, it's special.

13:01.138 --> 13:03.840
It's one-of-a-kind, distinctive.
Can I?

13:03.855 --> 13:05.182
Oh, sure, of course.

13:05.198 --> 13:07.621
Hi. Hi, bubby.

13:07.638 --> 13:10.660
Hi. Oh, precious.

13:10.678 --> 13:12.533
- How old is she? Two weeks?
- 11 days.

13:12.545 --> 13:14.643
Oh, wow. And how's Liz?

13:14.656 --> 13:16.071
Oh, they're great.
They're both doing great.

13:16.108 --> 13:19.430
They're gonna make very strange parents
but, you know, good ones, I know.

13:19.447 --> 13:21.823
Nothing wrong with a strange
but loving household.

13:21.837 --> 13:23.253
Yeah, I guess.

13:23.447 --> 13:25.343
Look at her long fingers.

13:25.355 --> 13:26.761
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

13:26.776 --> 13:28.920
What are you gonna be --
a pianist when you grow up?

13:28.938 --> 13:31.142
Is that what you're gonna be,
pretty girl?

13:31.155 --> 13:33.973
Or a pickpocket.
Well, yes, you might.

13:33.987 --> 13:36.151
You might be a
pickpocketing pianist.

13:36.165 --> 13:37.943
Oh, look what she did.

13:39.248 --> 13:41.890
- Pretty.
- She's trying to take my finger.

13:43.645 --> 13:45.093
Hey.

13:45.597 --> 13:48.431
Hey. Look. It's Liz's new baby.

13:48.498 --> 13:49.800
- Cute.
- Yeah.

13:49.815 --> 13:52.853
Well, thanks, um,
for letting me hold her.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.753
And tell Liz congratulations
for me, okay?

13:55.766 --> 13:56.540
- Will do.
- All right.

13:56.575 --> 13:57.571
- See you.
- See you.

13:57.585 --> 13:58.741
- Want me to --
- I got it.

13:58.756 --> 13:59.822
Okay.

14:05.088 --> 14:06.013
We don't have to eat here.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.710
Oh, yes, we do.
You're on my turf now.

14:07.726 --> 14:09.072
- Your turf.
- My turf.

14:09.086 --> 14:10.230
You know,
I did go to school here.

14:10.265 --> 14:11.472
Yeah, you graduated from Yale.

14:11.485 --> 14:13.171
You can eat from their
cafeteria at least once.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.612
I stopped by for the
occasional bowl of cereal.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.313
Yeah, cereal does
not count, okay?

14:16.326 --> 14:18.503
You need to get something hot,
mushy, and meaty.

14:18.515 --> 14:19.943
You're not making it
sound too appetizing.

14:19.976 --> 14:23.180
Oh, it's not. I have an extra
family pass from parents' weekend.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.243
Oh, so when your parents came to visit,
they got to eat real food?

14:25.277 --> 14:27.310
I'm gonna tell them
that you're my brother

14:27.327 --> 14:29.481
and that you're gonna
get your meal comped.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.382
I don't mind paying
for my mushy meat.

14:31.397 --> 14:34.731
No, that's not the issue.
I mean, I know how to work the system.

14:34.745 --> 14:35.691
Oh, you do.

14:35.706 --> 14:37.242
Yeah, you know me --
I can be crafty.

14:37.256 --> 14:39.373
Yeah, you can be crafty,
you can make a necklace out of macaroni,

14:39.406 --> 14:40.631
but this is
high-stakes deception.

14:40.665 --> 14:43.603
What's my middle name?
Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.193
- Card.
- There you go.

14:45.206 --> 14:47.772
And this is my family
pass for my brother here.

14:47.785 --> 14:49.021
Logan!

14:49.096 --> 14:50.662
What's up, brother?
What the hell are you doing here?

14:50.698 --> 14:52.522
I thought you moved to
London to run the world or something.

14:52.556 --> 14:53.501
Just back for a visit.

14:53.515 --> 14:54.663
My brother went here, too.

14:54.675 --> 14:55.871
Is this your girlfriend, Rory?

14:55.876 --> 14:57.153
I don't know. Is it?

14:57.165 --> 14:58.752
I'm a terrible liar.

14:58.946 --> 15:00.463
Apparently so.

15:00.577 --> 15:02.831
- Hi. I'm Rory.
- Brandon. Nice to meet you.

15:02.848 --> 15:03.601
You too.

15:03.617 --> 15:05.581
So, Dennis,
how much is a lunch pass?

15:05.597 --> 15:06.972
$9.75. 

15:06.988 --> 15:08.102
So you're still with Nicole?

15:08.116 --> 15:10.050
Yeah, till I die
or she kills me.

15:10.065 --> 15:11.680
- Well, give her my best.
- Will do, buddy.

15:11.717 --> 15:12.841
- Good to see you, Logan.
- You, too.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.151
- Nice to meet you, Rory.
- You too. Bye.

15:15.307 --> 15:17.021
- Smooth.
- Shut up.

15:17.035 --> 15:19.291
- Man, you worked the system.
- You totally left me hanging there.

15:19.325 --> 15:21.183
What  could I do?
You were working the system.

15:21.198 --> 15:23.740
In fact, you were working the system so
well, I think the system needs a day off.

15:23.777 --> 15:26.863
I'll have the chicken, and he'll
have the meat loaf with extra gravy.

15:26.877 --> 15:28.690
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

15:28.717 --> 15:31.211
Oh, hey, there's Lucy. Lucy!

15:31.305 --> 15:32.481
Hi!

15:32.496 --> 15:35.240
You must be Rory's
imaginary boyfriend, Logan.

15:35.258 --> 15:36.481
- Hi, Lucy.
- Hi.

15:36.496 --> 15:40.370
I would give you a proper hug,
but my pockets are full of Apple Jacks.

15:40.385 --> 15:42.250
I have art history
in a few minutes,

15:42.266 --> 15:45.282
and my professor sounds like
Garrison Keillor on quaaludes,

15:45.296 --> 15:47.913
so I need a constant intake
of sugar just to stay awake.

15:47.927 --> 15:51.281
I was just treating Logan to his
first branford dining hall meat loaf.

15:51.297 --> 15:54.072
Oh, you're in for a
treat and a stomachache.

15:54.085 --> 15:55.103
I can tell.

15:55.116 --> 15:58.112
So, congratulations on buying
the internet or something.

15:58.127 --> 16:00.122
Thank you, although Al Gore
and I are still negotiating.

16:00.155 --> 16:01.522
So it's not a done deal yet.

16:01.537 --> 16:04.151
It's too bad that you have class.
You could have eaten with us.

16:04.168 --> 16:06.680
Sad. Hey,
why don't we have dinner?

16:06.698 --> 16:09.272
I have a lecture tonight,
but what about tomorrow night?

16:09.285 --> 16:10.371
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

16:10.388 --> 16:12.172
Fun! We'll have to
go to Panchali's.

16:12.185 --> 16:14.102
It's this new indian
restaurant right off campus.

16:14.136 --> 16:17.113
It's awesome, and I swear,
no matter how much food you order,

16:17.128 --> 16:18.912
you cannot spend
more than 7 bucks.

16:18.927 --> 16:20.900
Sounds like
stomachache number two.

16:21.547 --> 16:24.132
- Hey, babe. Come on.
- Boyfriend!

16:28.085 --> 16:31.521
Boyfriend, this is Rory's
imaginary boyfriend, Logan.

16:31.535 --> 16:32.953
I know Marty.
How you doing, man?

16:32.966 --> 16:33.612
Hey.

16:33.627 --> 16:35.211
How do you two know each other?

16:35.227 --> 16:37.612
We met when I was bartending
one of Logan's parties.

16:37.626 --> 16:38.901
What a coinkydink.

16:38.917 --> 16:40.111
- Yeah.
- More than one.

16:40.126 --> 16:41.872
He did a couple blowouts for me,
and if I'm not mistaken,

16:41.908 --> 16:43.502
at the last one,
cops were called.

16:43.515 --> 16:44.692
That sounds familiar.

16:44.705 --> 16:47.832
You know, you probably met Marty, too,
and you just didn't even know it.

16:47.848 --> 16:50.823
We should go. I need to stop
by the library before class.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.191
Right. Okay, bye, guys.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.313
We will see you tomorrow
for basmati and vindaloo.

16:54.326 --> 16:56.452
- Okay. Bye.
- Later.

16:57.507 --> 16:59.463
Okay. Come on.

17:01.035 --> 17:02.942
- Is this okay?
- Fine.

17:02.958 --> 17:05.839
So, what's with that? What's with
the whole "you must have met Marty"?

17:05.855 --> 17:07.521
Oh, I meant to tell you.

17:07.538 --> 17:08.890
Tell me what?

17:08.906 --> 17:11.693
It's kind of embarrassing.
It's so juvenile and lame.

17:11.708 --> 17:13.442
It's like high school --
not even high school.

17:13.477 --> 17:15.391
- It's junior high.
- I'm listening.

17:15.407 --> 17:17.462
Well, I've been hanging
out with Lucy and Olivia

17:17.476 --> 17:19.710
and I keep hearing
about Lucy's boyfriend,

17:19.728 --> 17:22.451
and they never actually
said his name.

17:22.465 --> 17:25.089
And then when I finally met him,
it was Marty.

17:25.106 --> 17:28.752
And before I could even say anything,
he just pretended like we've never met.

17:28.766 --> 17:32.282
And I just didn't know what to do,
so I went along with it,

17:32.298 --> 17:35.302
but now Lucy still doesn't
know that we know each other.

17:35.316 --> 17:37.532
It's just kind of
weird and awkward.

17:37.546 --> 17:38.721
And did I mention juvenile?

17:38.737 --> 17:40.330
Why did you go along with it?

17:40.345 --> 17:43.923
I don't know. It just happened so fast.
I was caught off guard.

17:43.936 --> 17:45.603
So why would he pretend
not to know you?

17:45.616 --> 17:46.702
I don't know.

17:46.718 --> 17:50.583
I mean, maybe because he used to like
me, and maybe he still does a little.

17:50.597 --> 17:53.613
But that's stupid, because he's
with Lucy now, and she's amazing.

17:53.627 --> 17:55.330
They're great together.
And it's all so annoying.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.432
I mean, they don't call people by name.
They don't call anyone by name.

17:58.447 --> 18:01.351
French-fry guy -- I don't know
who that is. That could be you.

18:01.366 --> 18:03.222
- So what happened?
- What do you mean?

18:03.237 --> 18:04.771
He must have said or
done something, right?

18:04.808 --> 18:06.172
To make you think
he's still into you.

18:06.207 --> 18:07.501
I don't know.

18:07.516 --> 18:10.522
He said I was beautiful.
To me, he said it.

18:10.558 --> 18:13.332
Can't blame the guy for that.
You are beautiful.

18:13.345 --> 18:15.092
- The way he said it.
- Right.

18:15.105 --> 18:16.111
Yeah.

18:16.127 --> 18:18.331
So what?
You guys have been hanging out?

18:18.426 --> 18:21.710
No. No, I mean,
just when he's around with Lucy.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.353
So you have been hanging out.

18:23.368 --> 18:24.691
Just with Lucy.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.370
So why the secrecy?

18:26.778 --> 18:28.701
I told you,
I was caught off guard.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.643
No, with me.
Why did you never mention

18:30.656 --> 18:32.241
that you and Marty were
hanging out again?

18:32.277 --> 18:33.872
I just didn't
think it mattered.

18:33.886 --> 18:35.862
You're not the
secret-keeping type.

18:35.876 --> 18:38.711
Of course, that is before I knew you were
Rory "high-stakes deception" Gilmore.

18:38.745 --> 18:41.870
No, it wasn't a secret.
I mean, I didn't tell you.

18:41.885 --> 18:44.793
That's it. I swear.
I mean, I didn't not tell you.

18:44.805 --> 18:46.932
I just didn't think there
was anything to tell.

18:47.145 --> 18:48.802
Well, you have to tell Lucy.

18:48.868 --> 18:50.133
I know.

18:50.668 --> 18:51.892
I will.

18:51.907 --> 18:55.512
Just, I need to figure out the
right time and way to do it.

18:55.528 --> 18:57.372
I just don't want to
screw anything up.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.822
A little brotherly advice --
tell her sooner rather than later.

19:00.838 --> 19:02.753
Yeah, I will.
I'll figure something out.

19:02.765 --> 19:04.943
We don't have to go to dinner with them,
though. I can cancel that.

19:04.976 --> 19:06.810
No, it's fine.
We can go to dinner.

19:06.825 --> 19:08.791
Unless there's
something on your end.

19:09.208 --> 19:10.482
No.

19:10.495 --> 19:12.392
Logan, god, no.

19:12.407 --> 19:14.191
Good. Then let's go to dinner.

19:15.156 --> 19:16.372
Okay.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.893
Really, they charge
10 bucks for this?

19:27.386 --> 19:29.143
Let's make a baby.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.362
- What do you mean?
- Seriously.

19:33.495 --> 19:35.393
- Christopher.
- What?

19:37.176 --> 19:39.620
- What are you talking about?
- Why not?

19:42.258 --> 19:43.621
What?

19:44.515 --> 19:46.050
Why not?

19:48.478 --> 19:53.063
Because we haven't talked
about it at all -- ever.

19:53.078 --> 19:55.330
Okay, well,
let's talk about it.

19:57.318 --> 19:58.510
Okay.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.721
You want another kid,
don't you?

20:01.735 --> 20:05.320
Oh, god.
Uh, I don't know. I, um...

20:06.597 --> 20:09.580
- Sure, maybe.
- Me too.

20:09.598 --> 20:13.323
And, you know, last one 
turned out pretty good, so...

20:14.577 --> 20:16.911
Last one didn't turn
out pretty good.

20:17.057 --> 20:18.472
Last one came out

20:18.486 --> 20:22.223
and a lot of work went into
getting her to pretty good.

20:22.238 --> 20:24.201
You're right. You're right.

20:24.217 --> 20:26.312
I'm -- I'm sorry.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.760
It's okay.

20:27.828 --> 20:30.791
No, you're right.
You're absolutely right.

20:30.806 --> 20:33.793
But, um, it's different now.

20:33.806 --> 20:35.603
We're adults. We're married.

20:35.936 --> 20:37.493
It'd be easier.

20:38.437 --> 20:39.722
Yeah.

20:40.466 --> 20:43.002
I guess. I don't know.
I think...

20:43.048 --> 20:46.630
I want another kid.

20:47.928 --> 20:50.350
Okay, well,
we're on the same page.

20:50.366 --> 20:52.043
Let's go for it.

20:52.538 --> 20:55.022
Honey... Chris... honey...

20:55.195 --> 20:58.233
Seriously -- seriously,
I don't want to go for it right now.

21:00.735 --> 21:02.182
Why not?

21:02.735 --> 21:04.723
Why not? We just got married.

21:04.738 --> 21:06.683
I mean,
G.G.'s not even back from France.

21:07.605 --> 21:09.522
So you don't want
to because of G.G.?

21:09.538 --> 21:11.272
No, I mean,
it's not because of G.G.

21:11.286 --> 21:13.442
Because financially, we're good.
We're set.

21:13.457 --> 21:15.173
We could have a thousand kids,
feed them,

21:15.186 --> 21:17.281
send them to Harvard undergrad,
law school.

21:17.296 --> 21:18.732
No, I know.

21:20.308 --> 21:22.270
Do you not think we'll work?

21:23.126 --> 21:24.542
What?

21:24.567 --> 21:26.690
Because if that's what you're thinking,
it's a little late.

21:26.726 --> 21:28.910
Oh, my god, no.
That's not what I'm thinking.

21:28.927 --> 21:30.712
That's not what I'm
thinking at all.

21:30.728 --> 21:32.191
What are you thinking?

21:32.208 --> 21:36.090
I just -- What is this?
What is the rush? Why right now?

21:40.967 --> 21:42.131
Chris.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.151
Yeah. No, it's fine.

21:48.385 --> 21:49.900
- Honey...
- No, you're right.

21:49.918 --> 21:52.601
We should wait.
We should. You're right.

22:09.788 --> 22:12.070
- Cesar, what time you got?
- 10 after 2:00.

22:12.086 --> 22:14.380
All right. Well, as soon as April
gets here, we're gonna have to run,

22:14.418 --> 22:15.890
'cause we're gonna
miss the movie.

22:15.905 --> 22:17.701
- I'm feeling you.
- Stop feeling me.

22:17.717 --> 22:19.603
So business has been
going like gangbusters.

22:19.616 --> 22:20.711
Congratulations.

22:20.728 --> 22:23.791
Yeah, I'm destroying those
Stars Hollow middle school kids.

22:23.805 --> 22:26.793
Destroying --
outselling them by three or four times.

22:26.807 --> 22:29.673
I think it's safe to say they won't be
getting their new gym anytime soon.

22:29.706 --> 22:31.111
You must be very proud.

22:31.126 --> 22:32.202
I am.

22:32.215 --> 22:35.011
Sure there's been an increase in
prank phone calls, but so what?

22:35.027 --> 22:36.463
I can answer the
phone all day long.

22:36.477 --> 22:37.273
I'm sure.

22:37.287 --> 22:40.621
And so they've ordered pizzas
to my house day and night.

22:40.636 --> 22:42.710
You know what? I love pizza.

22:42.725 --> 22:43.701
Bring it on.

22:43.717 --> 22:45.720
They think they're intimidating me,
but I'm not scared.

22:45.757 --> 22:47.522
12-year-olds don't scare you.

22:47.537 --> 22:48.611
Not at all.

22:48.627 --> 22:50.021
Kirk!

22:53.236 --> 22:55.380
I thought I told
you to get lost.

22:55.396 --> 22:56.663
We want to talk.

22:56.675 --> 22:57.752
So talk.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.790
Not here. Outside.

22:59.897 --> 23:01.853
All right. Let's go.

23:01.865 --> 23:05.740
But I'm warning you -- if it gets
physical, I will show no mercy.

23:09.607 --> 23:10.551
Hello?

23:10.567 --> 23:11.903
Hey, Anna, it's Luke.

23:11.916 --> 23:12.512
Yeah?

23:12.525 --> 23:14.823
Yeah, I was just wondering
if April took off.

23:14.838 --> 23:16.133
She's not here yet,
and she's never late.

23:16.166 --> 23:17.250
I'm just getting
a little worried.

23:17.286 --> 23:19.522
- April's fine.
- Is she on her way?

23:19.537 --> 23:21.322
No, she's not coming.

23:21.715 --> 23:23.110
What does that mean?

23:23.128 --> 23:25.662
Luke, you can't just come to my house,
threaten me,

23:25.678 --> 23:28.140
and then expect me to send
April off to see you.

23:28.155 --> 23:30.503
Look, things got a little
heated the other night.

23:30.515 --> 23:32.003
Yes, they certainly did,
and frankly,

23:32.015 --> 23:34.280
I'm not comfortable with April
being with you right now.

23:34.295 --> 23:35.322
Anna, wait.

23:35.338 --> 23:38.170
No, Luke, I won't,
because this is my decision.

23:38.188 --> 23:39.241
Goodbye.

23:46.025 --> 23:50.713
So we moved away from a literal
theme as per our star's request.

23:50.725 --> 23:52.261
- Star -- that's me.
- Yeah, I got it.

23:52.278 --> 23:55.002
We did manage to squeeze some favorite
colors out of her, didn't we?

23:55.015 --> 23:56.461
Yellow, like my
sunny disposition.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.150
Eh, eh, eh. Not yellow.
Buttercup and buttercream.

23:59.166 --> 24:00.441
Do you like buttercream
and buttermilk, honey?

24:00.476 --> 24:02.383
Or would you like
a nondairy color?

24:02.397 --> 24:04.633
Please say you like them.
I've coordinated everything.

24:04.648 --> 24:05.283
It's fine.

24:05.295 --> 24:08.100
So of course this area will be
for the tables, as discussed.

24:08.115 --> 24:12.522
The orchestra -- excuse me --
band will be over there.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.842
And obviously,
the dance floor is right here.

24:14.855 --> 24:16.782
Actually, I'm morally
opposed to dancing,

24:16.797 --> 24:18.453
so that's not
gonna work for me.

24:18.467 --> 24:20.041
She's just kidding.

24:21.305 --> 24:25.222
I'm so glad you're here. Maybe you can
help keep Lorelai's snarkiness in check.

24:25.238 --> 24:26.870
Let's see what
he's got planned.

24:28.315 --> 24:30.902
So we still have to
decide on the score.

24:30.917 --> 24:32.903
Have you made a list of
your favorite music?

24:32.915 --> 24:35.992
No list necessary. It's going to be
Burt Bacharach. And nothing but.

24:36.066 --> 24:37.032
Really?

24:37.047 --> 24:39.020
- We'll make a list.
- Wonderful.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.272
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

24:41.288 --> 24:44.153
Now, for the fish course, I believe
we have either a Pouilly FuissÃ©

24:44.165 --> 24:45.982
or a Muscat,
if you go with the salmon,

24:45.995 --> 24:48.562
and I do think you should
go with the salmon.

24:48.577 --> 24:49.740
Agreed.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.722
Now, as far as the vows go --

24:52.136 --> 24:54.240
I'm sorry. The vows?

24:54.257 --> 24:55.391
Wedding vows.

24:55.406 --> 24:56.652
What are you talking about?

24:56.666 --> 24:58.973
They can be traditional,
or you can write your own,

24:58.987 --> 25:01.800
which seems to be the style, nowadays,
although if you ask me, it's rather garish.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.113
Cecily Pendelem's daughter
actually promised

25:04.126 --> 25:06.153
to cook her husband
lasagna once a month.

25:06.165 --> 25:08.702
Who wants to hear the word
"lasagna" at a wedding?

25:08.716 --> 25:11.683
Well, you make a good point, but this
is not a wedding. It's just a party.

25:11.698 --> 25:13.402
A party to celebrate
a marriage,

25:13.415 --> 25:16.762
which is why a simple exchange
of vows is entirely appropriate.

25:16.778 --> 25:20.010
Mom, we agreed to a party, okay?
Just a party.

25:20.028 --> 25:21.410
A wedding is a party.

25:21.425 --> 25:23.103
Yes, but we are
already married.

25:23.115 --> 25:25.080
Yes, and no one
got to witness it.

25:25.095 --> 25:26.993
Did it ever occur to you
that your father and I

25:27.005 --> 25:29.600
might like to see our
only child get married?

25:29.617 --> 25:31.952
- Christopher?
- I don't think it's such a bad idea.

25:31.967 --> 25:34.031
- What?
- Might be kind of nice.

25:34.798 --> 25:37.812
Wait a minute. Is this an ambush?
Are you guys ambushing me?

25:37.828 --> 25:40.113
No one is ambushing
you, Lorelai.

25:40.126 --> 25:43.441
The idea of your exchanging vows in
front of your family and friends

25:43.455 --> 25:44.953
isn't so outrageous.

25:44.966 --> 25:48.943
Mom, the whole reason we eloped
is to avoid the wedding thing.

25:48.955 --> 25:51.031
No, that's not the reason we eloped.
We eloped because

25:51.065 --> 25:52.642
we love each other and we
wanted to get married.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.280
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

25:54.297 --> 25:55.652
- Chris.
- What is the big deal?

25:55.665 --> 25:58.083
The big deal is I don't want to
do it and we're already married.

25:58.116 --> 25:59.983
- So that's it.
- Well...

25:59.996 --> 26:02.310
I don't even know why I'm here.
It's not like my opinion really matters.

26:02.348 --> 26:03.330
Of course it does.

26:03.346 --> 26:04.863
You're gonna do what
you want to do.

26:04.877 --> 26:07.040
House, wedding, kids --
it's all your call, right?

26:07.057 --> 26:08.813
Are you talking about
having more children?

26:08.827 --> 26:09.763
Thank you.

26:09.778 --> 26:11.782
- Wait! Are you pregnant?
- No

26:11.798 --> 26:13.070
- That's nice.
- What?

26:13.086 --> 26:14.853
You don't have to act like it's the
most horrible thing in the world.

26:14.885 --> 26:16.192
Can we not talk about this now?

26:16.208 --> 26:18.372
Why? You don't want to be spur-
of-the-moment? Let's discuss things.

26:18.408 --> 26:20.201
Randall, perhaps we should
give them some privacy.

26:20.235 --> 26:21.072
Of course.

26:21.558 --> 26:24.020
- What is wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

26:24.037 --> 26:26.652
You're airing all our business in
front of my mother of all people.

26:26.687 --> 26:28.273
What is your problem
with a wedding?

26:28.285 --> 26:29.460
We're already married.

26:29.476 --> 26:33.141
Exactly, so what's the big deal? You
planned a huge wedding with that diner guy.

26:33.155 --> 26:34.742
"That diner guy"?

26:34.758 --> 26:36.140
Oh, I'm sorry,
should I be more respectful

26:36.176 --> 26:37.701
to the guy who punched
me in the face?

26:37.715 --> 26:39.812
- Is that what this is about?
- No, this is about us.

26:39.828 --> 26:41.831
At least, that's what I thought,
but apparently it's about you.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.481
What is that supposed to mean?

26:43.495 --> 26:45.562
You know what?
I'm going back to work.

26:45.576 --> 26:48.531
No, no. Christopher, hey.

26:54.528 --> 26:56.221
So you want to sue for custody.

26:56.235 --> 26:59.722
No, I don't want to sue her.
I just want...

27:00.397 --> 27:03.982
this or something like this.

27:04.558 --> 27:06.880
- So you want partial custody.
- Is that what that is?

27:06.898 --> 27:07.911
- Yeah.
- Yeah, fine.

27:07.925 --> 27:09.542
Then I want partial custody.

27:09.555 --> 27:11.191
Then you have to sue for it.

27:11.207 --> 27:13.061
- Really?
- Really.

27:13.078 --> 27:14.941
But you're not gonna get this.

27:14.956 --> 27:15.941
Why not?

27:15.958 --> 27:18.732
From everything you've just told me,
this is a best-case scenario,

27:18.746 --> 27:21.553
and I'm not really in the
best-case-scenario business.

27:21.566 --> 27:22.572
What does that mean?

27:22.588 --> 27:26.033
It means you haven't been in
April's life for the past 12 years.

27:26.047 --> 27:28.982
But that wasn't my fault.
I didn't know she existed.

27:28.997 --> 27:31.171
- Doesn't matter.
- How can it not matter?

27:31.187 --> 27:33.372
Because she has a
history with her mother.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.950
This is not about
what you want, Luke.

27:35.965 --> 27:37.921
This is not about
what Anna wants.

27:37.937 --> 27:40.303
The court only cares
what's best for April,

27:40.316 --> 27:42.823
and in these types of cases,

27:42.837 --> 27:45.551
they almost always
side with the mother.

27:46.995 --> 27:48.570
So what can I do?

27:48.668 --> 27:49.840
You can fight.

27:49.858 --> 27:51.172
You can make your case.

27:51.187 --> 27:53.721
- Okay.
- Okay.

27:53.787 --> 27:55.641
What about Anna's history?

27:55.907 --> 27:59.130
- Anna's?
- Any police records? Incidents?

27:59.147 --> 28:01.061
Uh, no.

28:01.077 --> 28:03.642
Erratic behavior?
Drugs? Alcohol?

28:03.658 --> 28:05.211
I don't think so.

28:05.426 --> 28:07.010
So you don't know.

28:07.028 --> 28:08.680
We'll look into it.

28:08.805 --> 28:10.331
What about you?

28:11.315 --> 28:12.741
Any record?

28:12.757 --> 28:14.110
No.

28:14.908 --> 28:17.761
Well, yes, actually.

28:17.798 --> 28:21.002
I beat up this guy's car this --
this one time.

28:21.017 --> 28:22.493
It was no big deal.

28:22.508 --> 28:24.900
Did you attend
anger-management classes?

28:24.918 --> 28:25.923
No.

28:25.936 --> 28:27.781
Would you be willing to?

28:28.036 --> 28:29.703
I don't need to.

28:29.716 --> 28:31.223
You might.

28:31.757 --> 28:33.143
Look...

28:33.435 --> 28:35.323
I don't want this to get ugly.

28:35.336 --> 28:37.211
I just want what's fair.

28:37.226 --> 28:39.292
Custody battles get ugly, Luke,

28:39.305 --> 28:41.543
and they're not
about what's fair.

28:41.558 --> 28:44.950
The truth is this will be long,
it will be expensive,

28:44.968 --> 28:46.423
it will be unpleasant,

28:46.438 --> 28:48.591
and you'll probably lose.

28:48.607 --> 28:52.101
But if you want your daughter,
it's the only way.

28:52.625 --> 28:56.033
And time is of the essence here, because
once Anna moves April out of state,

28:56.048 --> 28:59.120
it becomes infinitely
more complicated.

29:01.018 --> 29:04.550
So I beg and plea with him,
and he says he'll try and come.

29:04.566 --> 29:07.002
but I'm afraid he won't,
and I just can't wait any longer.

29:07.016 --> 29:08.833
So I take the ticket,
and I go running off.

29:08.847 --> 29:10.511
I run all the way
back to the theater.

29:10.528 --> 29:12.140
When I get there,
I burst through the doors.

29:12.177 --> 29:15.333
There's sweat pouring off of
me and I'm gasping for breath.

29:15.347 --> 29:16.223
And everybody's gone?

29:16.235 --> 29:18.752
No, the director
is still there.

29:18.765 --> 29:20.261
- No!
- I know, right.

29:20.277 --> 29:21.481
- Can you pass the raita?
- Sure.

29:21.518 --> 29:23.600
So I say to him,
"you have to let me audition."

29:23.616 --> 29:26.192
And he says, "you can't audition,
because the auditions are over."

29:26.226 --> 29:29.663
And I say, "the auditions can't be over,
because I haven't auditioned yet."

29:29.676 --> 29:31.551
And he says,
"you're two hours too late."

29:31.565 --> 29:34.031
And I say, "that's because
I was in a traffic accident,

29:34.045 --> 29:35.262
and I have the
cop to prove it."

29:35.297 --> 29:37.843
Just as I'm about to say,
"and he'll be here any minute,"

29:37.855 --> 29:40.051
and, you know,
not really believing it,

29:40.066 --> 29:42.623
officer Frick comes
waltzing through the door.

29:42.636 --> 29:44.231
- No!
- Like Fred Astaire.

29:44.246 --> 29:46.691
- Officer Frick came through.
- Officer Frick came through.

29:46.708 --> 29:48.953
- So you got the part?
- Oh, no.

29:48.965 --> 29:50.283
I was totally wrong for it.

29:50.297 --> 29:53.413
But officer Frick introduced
me to his nephew Drew,

29:53.427 --> 29:56.043
and we went out a few times,
so that was cool.

29:56.058 --> 29:59.212
Lucy, hands down, that is the best "dedicated
to my craft" story I've ever heard.

29:59.228 --> 30:00.482
Why, thank you.

30:00.495 --> 30:02.380
Hard-working and beautiful --
she's something special.

30:02.416 --> 30:03.950
You got yourself a
good one here, Marty.

30:03.987 --> 30:04.813
Thanks.

30:04.825 --> 30:06.922
Oh, Rory's got way better
stories than I do.

30:06.938 --> 30:09.703
Did she ever tell you about the time
she drove out to her professor's house

30:09.738 --> 30:12.141
in Albany to replace the
last page of her final?

30:12.158 --> 30:14.701
Well, it was in the wrong font,
and I got an "a" on that paper.

30:14.715 --> 30:16.471
Wasn't that the professor
who had a crush on you?

30:16.506 --> 30:18.863
Hey! Are you saying that
she didn't deserve the "a"?

30:18.877 --> 30:21.573
I'm just saying the woman is the
object of many strange crushes.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.892
Oh, that's not true.

30:22.907 --> 30:24.670
The oddball who works
at Baskin-Robbins?

30:24.687 --> 30:26.721
She can't walk within a block
of the place without the guy

30:26.758 --> 30:28.491
running out with a triple scoop
of mint chocolate chip.

30:28.508 --> 30:29.680
So not true.

30:29.698 --> 30:31.401
Hey, she's something special.

30:31.416 --> 30:34.212
Hey you know, I put four pages
of endnotes on that final.

30:34.227 --> 30:35.333
I deserved that "a."

30:35.348 --> 30:38.431
I'm not saying you're not dedicated to your
schoolwork. You're the hardest worker I know.

30:38.448 --> 30:41.251
See, I was always about doing just
enough, or maybe a little less.

30:41.267 --> 30:43.700
Well, look at you now, Mr.
Slaving away.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.333
It's true. My rep is ruined.

30:45.347 --> 30:47.700
Boyfriend works insanely hard.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.061
Is that true, Marty?

30:49.076 --> 30:50.333
I just have a couple jobs.

30:50.346 --> 30:52.471
Four! The man has four jobs.

30:52.487 --> 30:55.833
And a full class load.
It's nuts! Right, Rory?

30:56.007 --> 30:57.891
It does seem a bit excessive.

30:57.908 --> 31:00.243
- It's not four.
- Four. Rory?

31:00.665 --> 31:02.020
I think so.

31:02.038 --> 31:05.690
Finnegan's, the bookstore,
tutoring, and landscaping.

31:05.708 --> 31:08.260
The landscaping is seasonal.
I haven't done that for months.

31:08.278 --> 31:10.822
But you will,
and that will be four.

31:10.836 --> 31:12.570
That's a lot of jobs, my boy.

31:12.836 --> 31:16.552
Hey, I'm just waiting for
that trust fund to kick in.

31:17.927 --> 31:18.963
I got it.

31:20.557 --> 31:22.210
- There.
- Thanks.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.540
So how did you two meet?

31:26.157 --> 31:27.732
- Tell him.
- What?

31:27.748 --> 31:29.803
- Tell him!
- Why?

31:29.938 --> 31:31.793
He stalked me.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.210
That's charming.

31:33.437 --> 31:36.702
I was playing Portia in "The
Merchant of Venice" at the rep,

31:36.715 --> 31:40.860
and every night,
I see this guy in the front row --

31:40.878 --> 31:43.420
same seat, same intense gaze.

31:43.438 --> 31:46.450
And after the fifth show,
I went up to him and I said,

31:46.465 --> 31:50.122
"next time I see you, you better bring
flowers or have a knife and stab me."

31:50.138 --> 31:51.123
And...

31:51.138 --> 31:54.773
The next time I saw her,
I had daisies and a butter knife.

31:54.787 --> 31:56.093
Sweet.

31:57.336 --> 32:00.763
I can't believe I don't even know this.
How did you two meet?

32:01.405 --> 32:03.563
Actually, Marty introduced us.

32:04.838 --> 32:06.280
What?

32:06.318 --> 32:08.102
I'm sorry.
I can't be a part of this.

32:08.115 --> 32:09.550
- A part of what?
- Logan.

32:09.566 --> 32:11.741
They've known each other
since freshman year.

32:11.796 --> 32:13.350
I don't understand.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.602
Rory and Marty, they used to hang
out all the time at Branford

32:15.636 --> 32:17.143
and watch "Duck Soup."

32:17.227 --> 32:20.672
What are you talking about?
W-What is he talking about?

32:20.687 --> 32:22.810
- Lucy --
- You guys know each other?

32:23.307 --> 32:24.230
Yes.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.780
It was freshman year.
It's no big deal.

32:26.797 --> 32:28.560
You've been keeping
this from me?

32:28.578 --> 32:30.600
Why? I-I don't understand.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.682
You guys are friends?
You know each other?

32:32.696 --> 32:34.833
- I'm sorry, Lucy.
- We just didn't think --

32:34.846 --> 32:36.981
So you both have been
lying to me about this?

32:36.998 --> 32:39.213
I don't understand.
Why? For what?

32:39.228 --> 32:40.263
I don't know.

32:40.277 --> 32:43.452
Oh, my god. This is so messed up.
I have to go.

32:43.467 --> 32:44.830
Lucy...

32:49.158 --> 32:50.641
What is wrong with you?

32:50.657 --> 32:53.573
I was asked a direct question.
I'm not gonna lie. She's a nice girl.

32:53.585 --> 32:56.533
Yeah, I know she's a nice girl.
She's my friend.

32:56.545 --> 32:58.242
You were gonna tell her anyway.

32:58.257 --> 33:01.700
Not here. Not like this.
You totally humiliated her.

33:01.716 --> 33:04.543
Lucy's humiliated because of what
you and Marty did to her, not me.

33:04.558 --> 33:06.722
I told her the truth,
which is something she could use more of

33:06.757 --> 33:08.513
from her supposed friend
and her boyfriend.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.502
I can't believe you're
trying to justify this.

33:10.515 --> 33:12.070
What you did was so obnoxious.

33:12.086 --> 33:13.783
I was just being honest.

33:16.868 --> 33:18.863
I'm just gonna head back
into the city tonight.

33:18.877 --> 33:20.833
I've got a lot of
work to do tomorrow.

33:21.495 --> 33:22.882
Fine.

33:36.986 --> 33:39.032
Hi. 143.

33:39.047 --> 33:39.980
What?

33:39.997 --> 33:43.101
I want to talk to you, but I'm
gonna lose count, so remember 143.

33:43.115 --> 33:45.113
- 143 what?
- Soaps.

33:45.125 --> 33:46.930
- What are you doing?
- Inventory.

33:46.946 --> 33:48.473
- At the inn?
- No, at the Pentagon.

33:48.485 --> 33:51.303
I'm tracking soaps and nuclear
missiles for General Abizaid.

33:51.317 --> 33:52.570
Isn't it a little late?

33:52.586 --> 33:54.032
The general's a slave driver.

33:54.047 --> 33:54.721
Mom.

33:54.735 --> 33:58.001
Well, it had to get done at some point,
so I thought I'd do it at this point.

33:58.018 --> 34:00.310
- I count better at night.
- Okay.

34:00.328 --> 34:01.730
So what's going on?

34:01.745 --> 34:03.520
I thought it was
an all-Logan week.

34:03.535 --> 34:05.863
- It was.
- Was?

34:05.875 --> 34:08.342
- Boys suck.
- Oh, hon.

34:08.358 --> 34:11.090
- They totally suck.
- Sometimes they do.

34:11.108 --> 34:12.989
Tell me it gets better
when they get older.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.922
It gets better when
they get older.

34:14.938 --> 34:17.193
- It does?
- Well, it gets more confusing,

34:17.206 --> 34:20.210
more complicated, and more complex.
Does any of that sound better?

34:20.228 --> 34:21.092
No.

34:21.108 --> 34:23.540
- So what happened?
- It was awful.

34:23.558 --> 34:26.011
We went to dinner
with Lucy and Marty,

34:26.027 --> 34:28.172
and I told him
everything beforehand --

34:28.188 --> 34:30.802
about how Marty pretended that
we didn't know each other

34:30.818 --> 34:32.460
and I just had to go with it.

34:32.688 --> 34:34.953
Yeah. So right in
the middle of dinner,

34:34.966 --> 34:37.532
he decides that he can't lie to Lucy,
and he tells her

34:37.547 --> 34:40.139
that Marty and I have known
each other since freshman year.

34:40.157 --> 34:41.760
- Yikes!
- I know.

34:41.777 --> 34:43.880
Who does that, right?
Right in the middle of dinner.

34:43.898 --> 34:45.712
He has no reason to be jealous.

34:45.728 --> 34:47.222
I mean,
he knows that I love him.

34:47.235 --> 34:48.371
Of course he does.

34:48.386 --> 34:49.612
So why would he do it?

34:49.626 --> 34:52.013
I have no idea.
Mars and venus, you know?

34:52.027 --> 34:53.541
Yeah, see,
I don't think that's right.

34:53.547 --> 34:55.659
Because mars and venus
are both planets, right?

34:55.675 --> 34:57.311
So they have
something in common.

34:57.326 --> 34:59.952
I think it's more like
mars and a bowl of soup.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.591
- Venus and a bowl of soup.
- What?

35:01.607 --> 35:03.710
Venus is the woman.
Venus and the bowl of soup.

35:03.725 --> 35:04.883
Really, mom?

35:04.898 --> 35:07.662
Well, I'm just saying.
So how's Lucy?

35:07.675 --> 35:10.250
I don't know.
Not good. She ran out.

35:10.267 --> 35:13.231
And I've been trying to call her,
but she won't answer her phone.

35:13.248 --> 35:15.680
I dont blame her. I mean,
I wouldn't want to talk to me right now.

35:15.716 --> 35:18.863
Oh, she'll be fine. She probably just
needs time to cool down, you know.

35:18.876 --> 35:21.872
Yeah, I hope so.
I mean, I feel terrible.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.433
Of course you do.

35:23.446 --> 35:24.990
You want to come home?

35:25.006 --> 35:27.381
I'm about to start
counting dust ruffles.

35:27.516 --> 35:28.843
No.

35:28.855 --> 35:31.871
I should actually probably go
over there and try, you know?

35:31.887 --> 35:33.743
See if she'll talk
to me in person.

35:33.758 --> 35:35.513
All right.
Let me know what happens.

35:35.527 --> 35:37.733
Yeah, I will. 143.

35:37.748 --> 35:39.003
Ah, thank you.

35:39.015 --> 35:40.121
Sorry boys suck.

35:40.136 --> 35:42.270
Yeah, stupid bowls of soup.

38:28.225 --> 38:30.210
Hey. Is Lucy here?

38:30.228 --> 38:31.403
She's here.

38:31.637 --> 38:32.881
Can I see her?

38:32.898 --> 38:36.433
She doesn't want to see you right now,
and, to be honest, neither do I.

38:36.445 --> 38:39.591
Olivia, just let me
explain, please.

38:39.606 --> 38:40.732
No.

39:01.988 --> 39:03.600
- Lorelai.
- Oh, my god!

39:03.618 --> 39:06.092
Mom, you scared me half to death.
What are you doing here?

39:06.107 --> 39:07.882
I want to talk to you, Lorelai.

39:07.898 --> 39:10.652
Ugh. Is this about the party?

39:10.665 --> 39:12.453
Because I've had
a really long day,

39:12.467 --> 39:14.150
and I don't want to
talk about the party.

39:14.167 --> 39:17.613
It's not about the party. I've come
to talk to you about your marriage.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.223
- My marriage?
- Yes, I'm concerned.

39:20.236 --> 39:21.572
I don't like what I'm seeing,

39:21.586 --> 39:23.710
and I've come to offer
you some friendly advice.

39:23.726 --> 39:25.642
Mom, I really don't
want your advice.

39:25.657 --> 39:28.470
Well, then consider
it unfriendly advice.

39:28.486 --> 39:29.270
Okay.

39:29.287 --> 39:31.980
Christopher is immature,
often foolish,

39:31.995 --> 39:34.221
and a little lacking
in common sense.

39:34.235 --> 39:36.430
He doesn't always make
the best choices.

39:36.445 --> 39:39.871
Like with me? Are you saying he
chose wrongly in choosing me?

39:39.886 --> 39:43.402
I'm saying he's your husband,
Lorelai, for better or for worse.

39:43.417 --> 39:45.012
I like Christopher.

39:45.755 --> 39:46.933
Okay.

39:46.947 --> 39:48.481
I think he's good for you.

39:48.498 --> 39:50.010
But it's not going
to be perfect.

39:50.025 --> 39:52.670
He's not perfect,
and god knows you're not perfect.

39:52.688 --> 39:55.310
But marriage is not
about always being happy,

39:55.326 --> 39:57.842
and often it's about
not being happy at all.

39:58.006 --> 40:01.790
It's about compromise,
which is not your strong suit.

40:01.806 --> 40:04.700
Marriage is about swallowing
your pride sometimes,

40:04.717 --> 40:06.660
about doing what he wants.

40:06.678 --> 40:08.370
It's not about
winning an argument,

40:08.386 --> 40:10.640
which may make you sad,
because that's what you love.

40:10.657 --> 40:14.423
But I don't want to
see you ruin this.

40:14.848 --> 40:16.860
Marriage is serious
business, Lorelai,

40:16.877 --> 40:19.010
and if you don't take
this very seriously,

40:19.025 --> 40:20.313
then this whole thing
could fall apart

40:20.345 --> 40:22.560
faster than you could
possibly imagine.

40:22.575 --> 40:25.203
And he'll be gone,
and you'll be alone again.

40:25.578 --> 40:27.610
A ring is no guarantee.

40:31.505 --> 40:33.262
Sorry for scaring you.
