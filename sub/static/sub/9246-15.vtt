00:04.613 --> 00:06.702
Tomorrow night, I'm showing up
at Christina's house

00:06.789 --> 00:08.095
with a dozen red roses

00:08.182 --> 00:09.966
and a box of fine
Belgian chocolates.

00:10.053 --> 00:12.882
My lady don't care
for no American chocolate.

00:12.969 --> 00:15.145
I can relate,
I'm the same way with Taffy.

00:15.232 --> 00:16.451
After I went to Atlantic City

00:16.538 --> 00:18.888
I became a bit of a Taffy snob.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.194
What are you talking about?

00:20.281 --> 00:23.458
I've seen you eat
plenty of crappy Taffy.

00:23.545 --> 00:24.894
Yeah, but I don't enjoy it.

00:26.939 --> 00:29.203
Anyway, after that,
I'm taking her out to dinner.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.422
Five courses, each paired
with its own special wine

00:31.509 --> 00:33.859
hand-picked by
the in-house sommelier.

00:33.946 --> 00:36.819
That's French
for "picker of the wine."

00:36.906 --> 00:38.908
Wow, sounds like
you're really going all out.

00:38.995 --> 00:41.041
Hey, it's our first
Valentine's Day together.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.259
Can't just drive
through a Taco Bell

00:42.346 --> 00:43.652
or take her bowling.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.088
No, I get it.

00:45.175 --> 00:46.742
I went through the same thing
last year, man.

00:46.829 --> 00:48.744
Candy, jewelry, carriage ride.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.267
Boy, I'm glad all that
romantic crap

00:50.354 --> 00:51.834
is behind me.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.053
You're at least gonna
take her out

00:53.140 --> 00:54.402
for dinner though
aren't you?

00:54.489 --> 00:55.881
She said she didn't
wanna do anything.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.709
No woman wants to cook
on Valentine's Day.

00:57.796 --> 00:59.146
And every restaurant
is booked solid..

00:59.233 --> 01:00.625
...well, unless it's got
a guy out front

01:00.712 --> 01:03.672
dressed as a hoagie,
and spinnin' an arrow.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.282
She said not to make
a big deal out of it.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.023
I'm just following orders.

01:07.110 --> 01:08.764
Mm. That's what they said
at Custer's last stand

01:08.851 --> 01:11.506
right before they got their
dumb white asses tomahawked.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.684
No, Molly's not like that.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.468
When she wants somethin',
she tells me

01:17.555 --> 01:21.255
sometimes two or three times,
until it really sinks in.

01:21.342 --> 01:24.258
Yeah, let me explain this to you
in a way you might understand.

01:24.345 --> 01:25.781
You know how when I go
to get a milk shake

01:25.868 --> 01:26.869
and I ask you if you
want one, and you say no?

01:26.956 --> 01:28.088
Uh-huh.

01:28.175 --> 01:29.480
Well, if I listen to you

01:29.567 --> 01:30.612
and I don't come back
with your own milk shake

01:30.699 --> 01:32.004
you get all pouty and mad.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.397
Oh, we've been together
a long time

01:33.484 --> 01:34.833
and I don't think
I should have to ask.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.315
And that's why I always
buy two milk shakes.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.577
Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to get another straw

01:39.664 --> 01:41.101
and share mine with you

01:41.188 --> 01:43.146
and that's a race
I cannot win.

wheat toast.

01:46.454 --> 01:47.629
Denver omelet with
hash browns.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.326
Oh, hash browns.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.807
And that's why Carl
ordered the second plate.

01:53.548 --> 01:54.636
Now, let me ask you

01:54.723 --> 01:56.072
how would you feel
right now

01:56.159 --> 01:59.075
if I didn't order you
those hash browns?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.163
Uh-oh.

worried about?

end up on the Internet

that ever happen?

on the computer all day

will pop up.

we're still on the same page

and I quote

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
"Don't make a big deal of it."

03:38.479 --> 03:40.394
And I meant it.

are two separate things.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.063
But I still think you should've
added a Mylar balloon to it.

08:19.150 --> 08:20.804
Nah, that would've
looked stupid.

08:20.891 --> 08:22.240
Besides, all they had left
was "Bar Mitzvah Boy"

08:22.327 --> 08:24.939
and "Lordy, Lordy
look who's forty."

08:25.026 --> 08:26.680
We still have enough time
to put on

08:26.767 --> 08:28.203
our nice clothes and head over
to the restaurant.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.639
Hey, you didn't happen
to bring an extra tie, did you?

08:29.726 --> 08:31.293
What's wrong
with the one you got on?

08:31.380 --> 08:32.294
I don't think a guy's
suppose to wear a black tie

08:32.381 --> 08:33.991
with a brown suit.

08:34.078 --> 08:36.428
I don't think a guy's
suppose to wear brown suit.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.953
Officers, there's a man
up on that ledge.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.128
I think he's gonna jump.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.260
Oh, perfect.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.653
Are you happy?

08:43.740 --> 08:44.959
Apparently happier than him.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.440
[instrumental music]

08:51.661 --> 08:53.271
[instrumental music]

08:59.756 --> 09:00.888
Good evening.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.893
I'm officer Michael Biggs.
Call me Mike.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.199
- What's your name, pal?
- What does it matter?

09:08.286 --> 09:11.638
I'm just another faceless cipher
that nobody cares about.

09:11.725 --> 09:13.640
Hey, I'm here, aren't I?

09:13.727 --> 09:14.989
Now, why don't you
come on inside

09:15.076 --> 09:16.773
and we'll talk about
whatever's buggin' you.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.907
She broke my heart,
tossed me aside like garbage.

09:19.994 --> 09:22.692
Little lady trouble, huh?

09:22.779 --> 09:24.346
Been there.

09:25.652 --> 09:26.609
How's it goin' out here?

09:26.696 --> 09:27.915
Everything's good.

09:28.002 --> 09:30.308
We're talkin',
not jumpin', right?

09:30.395 --> 09:32.615
How come there's no
news vans and helicopters?

09:32.702 --> 09:33.877
This is Valentine's Day.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.357
The city is filled
with jilted jumpers.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.664
You're lucky you got
your own ledge.

09:38.926 --> 09:40.144
You hear that?

09:40.231 --> 09:41.537
You're not the only
fella in town

09:41.624 --> 09:44.192
with a little case
of the "boo-hoos."

09:44.279 --> 09:46.498
Apparently there's some guy
on the Michigan Avenue Bridge

09:46.586 --> 09:48.152
dressed in a Batman suit.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.676
That must be gettin'
a lot of airplay.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.460
It's on every channel.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.375
Hey, let's face it,
you can't compete

09:53.462 --> 09:54.681
with Batman on a bridge.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.291
Now, why don't you
come inside?

09:56.378 --> 09:57.988
Yeah, and if you still
feel like jumping

09:58.075 --> 09:59.381
do it on a slow news day.

09:59.468 --> 10:02.514
You know, dressed
as an Angry Bird or Bozo.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.691
Oh, my God.
You guys suck at this.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.391
Sorry, it's been
kind of a crazy day for us.

10:09.478 --> 10:11.349
I'm standin' on a ledge.

10:11.436 --> 10:12.524
Absolutely.
You win.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.614
Worst day of anybody.

10:14.701 --> 10:15.658
Better call the girls
and tell 'em

10:15.745 --> 10:16.746
we're runnin' a little late.

10:16.833 --> 10:18.443
Yeah.

10:19.706 --> 10:20.794
By the way,
did you see he's got

10:20.881 --> 10:22.056
a dozen roses
layin' on the bed?

10:22.143 --> 10:23.579
I did. They're beautiful.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.233
Yeah, so whichever way
this plays out

10:25.320 --> 10:27.670
see I don't think he's gonna be
needing those flowers.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.413
[instrumental music]

10:33.633 --> 10:37.245
Aright, well, get here
as quick as you can.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.681
I am not sayin' that.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.728
Fine.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.294
Carl, you're my dark
chocolate tree.

10:43.381 --> 10:44.905
Now, just get here.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.125
Everything okay?

10:48.212 --> 10:49.649
Yeah, some emergency at work.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.302
So, they're runnin'
a little late.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.957
Carl said we should order
the drinks and appetizers, so..

10:54.044 --> 10:56.394
Hm. Done and done.

10:56.481 --> 10:58.048
It's a swanky joint,
isn't it?

10:58.135 --> 11:00.660
Mike must have charmed somebody
to get us this good table.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.357
Andto get them
to turn a two-top

11:02.444 --> 11:04.707
into a four-top
at the last minute.

11:04.794 --> 11:06.013
Last minute? No.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.492
Mike said he and Carl
set this up

11:07.579 --> 11:09.799
over a month ago.

11:09.886 --> 11:11.496
Yeah, they did.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.543
[groans]

11:14.630 --> 11:16.588
Mike piggybacked on your
romantic night, didn't he?

11:16.676 --> 11:17.981
Not at all.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.461
We are happy to share
the reservation

11:19.548 --> 11:20.941
with you guys.

11:21.028 --> 11:22.072
I should've known.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.117
When I brought up dinner

11:23.204 --> 11:24.422
he got that look
he always gets

11:24.509 --> 11:25.554
when he's caught in a lie

11:25.641 --> 11:27.121
or he's tryin' to sneak by me

11:27.208 --> 11:29.297
with a plunger behind his back.

11:30.341 --> 11:31.603
It's no big deal.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.605
The four of us can enjoy
a meal together.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.042
It's not like Carl and I
are plannin'

11:35.129 --> 11:36.130
on makin' out at the table.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.654
No matter what he thinks.

11:38.741 --> 11:41.962
You're very sweet, but I-I
just don't feel right about..

11:42.049 --> 11:43.833
You know what?
I'm just-I'm just gonna go.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.967
What? And leave me alone
here on Valentine's Day?

11:47.054 --> 11:50.710
At least have a drink
before the guys get here.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.146
Well..

11:52.233 --> 11:54.322
...maybe one drink.

11:54.409 --> 11:55.584
But when Mike does show up

11:55.671 --> 11:57.107
we're gonna let you guys
have your night

11:57.194 --> 12:00.067
and I'll tear him a new one
on the way home.

12:00.154 --> 12:02.243
Sounds like a plan.
Champagne?

12:02.330 --> 12:04.027
Ooh, yeah.
I yell better when I'm drunk.

12:05.681 --> 12:07.596
[instrumental music]

12:07.683 --> 12:09.424
It's gonna take me
a few more minutes to finish

12:09.511 --> 12:10.817
so if you need to leave
for your date

12:10.904 --> 12:12.296
I can let myself out.

12:12.383 --> 12:14.255
And don't worry,
I won't do anything weird

12:14.342 --> 12:16.953
like, sift through your laundry
basket or lay in your bed.

12:20.565 --> 12:24.047
No worries.
I'm stayin' in tonight.

12:24.134 --> 12:25.745
Ironic, huh?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.965
You're sexy and beautiful
and I'm awkward and dumpy

12:29.052 --> 12:31.620
yet we're both floating
in the same lonely boat.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.492
Mm-hm.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.407
Did you say
you were almost done?

12:37.495 --> 12:38.583
Right, right.

12:40.716 --> 12:41.935
It is gonna be weird

12:42.022 --> 12:44.981
spendin' Valentine's Day
by myself though.

12:45.068 --> 12:47.157
I've actually
never done it before.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.290
Oh, it's a piece of cake..

12:49.377 --> 12:52.510
...and six or seven donuts
and usually a pint of ice cream.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.687
That sounds cozy.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.082
Just stayin' home
and veggin' out.

12:59.169 --> 13:00.475
Oh you gotta make it fun.

13:00.562 --> 13:02.216
Otherwise, you'll blow
your brains out.

13:05.393 --> 13:06.873
Why don't you grab
some ice cream

13:06.960 --> 13:09.614
and I'll find
a romantic comedy.

13:09.701 --> 13:10.964
Two spoons?

13:11.051 --> 13:13.009
Better not.
I'm still on my diet.

13:13.096 --> 13:16.926
But would it be too weird
if I watched you eat it?

13:17.013 --> 13:19.624
A little weird.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.801
But this whole conversation
is weird.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.283
Perhaps a little ambience

13:26.370 --> 13:28.851
will increase my rather
bleak odds.

13:33.464 --> 13:34.814
[soft music]

13:36.641 --> 13:38.165
You're really gonna make me
go out on that ledge?

13:38.252 --> 13:39.731
You know I can't
stand heights.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.387
Hey, I do all the drivin'
and all the foot chases.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.041
Least you can do
is climb out on an icy ledge

13:45.128 --> 13:47.696
and bring that
nut job inside.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.437
I heard that.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.788
Just hug the building,
you'll be fine.

13:59.751 --> 14:03.103
Get lost, get lost.

14:05.279 --> 14:08.586
Oh, God. Don't look down,
don't look down.

14:10.023 --> 14:13.374
Okay, I'm gonna sit.
Carl, I'm gonna sit.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.506
[Carl]
'I got you man.
You're tied to the radiator.'

14:15.593 --> 14:16.768
What's the radiator
tied to?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.293
Watch it!

14:19.380 --> 14:21.338
Just lashin' out.

14:21.425 --> 14:24.341
I get it.

14:24.428 --> 14:26.517
You're a decent guy.

14:26.604 --> 14:27.997
If that woman
doesn't appreciate you

14:28.084 --> 14:29.738
then she doesn't
deserve you.

14:29.825 --> 14:32.219
Everything was going so well.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.829
Then she stopped
returning my calls

14:33.916 --> 14:35.526
then she changed her number

14:35.613 --> 14:37.920
then her boyfriend made her
get a restraining order.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.054
Well, gals are fickle.

14:43.056 --> 14:45.188
And I know things seem
really bleak right now

14:45.275 --> 14:47.364
but the right woman
can come along

14:47.451 --> 14:48.496
when you least expect it.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.845
That's what happened
to me.

14:49.932 --> 14:51.586
You got a girlfriend?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.414
Why you acting so surprised?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.068
I didn't mean anything
by it.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.721
Boy, you're sensitive.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.029
The girls said the entreecame.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.597
Osso bucco
with pumpkin ravioli.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.772
Here I am eating
cold French fries

15:03.859 --> 15:05.382
of a room service tray.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.080
You didn't charge that
to my room, did you?

15:07.167 --> 15:09.256
Is that what you choose
to focus on now?

15:10.344 --> 15:11.911
Carl, take it easy.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.174
It's his first Valentine's Day
with a girlfriend.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.262
He's got a girlfriend, too?

15:15.349 --> 15:17.046
Exactly.

15:17.133 --> 15:20.136
The two of us didn't give up,
neither should you.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.095
Why don't you come inside
and we'll talk.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.271
I'm not comin' inside
until she sees me on TV

15:24.358 --> 15:26.403
and falls in love with me
all over again.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.101
I wouldn't use
the word "falls."

15:31.756 --> 15:32.888
Man, he ain't gonna jump.

15:32.975 --> 15:34.237
Carl, what are you doin'?

15:34.324 --> 15:36.283
I'm gonna get this fool
off the ledge.

15:36.370 --> 15:38.024
- Scooch over!
- I'm not scoochin' anywhere.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.634
I'm suction-cupped
to this ledge.

15:39.721 --> 15:42.158
Fine!
Then I'll climb over you.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.248
Whoa! Oh, God!
I got you, I got you.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.685
You go, I go!
You go, I go!

15:47.772 --> 15:49.122
You guys are freakin'
me out.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.515
Shut up and grab his belt,
you nut job!

15:53.126 --> 15:54.779
I got you, buddy.

15:56.825 --> 15:58.740
[violin music]

16:04.920 --> 16:08.706
[clapping]
Oh, beautiful. Just gorgeous.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.360
Next time I come back,
I expect you to know

16:10.447 --> 16:11.883
"The Devil Went Down
To Georgia."

16:15.670 --> 16:18.281
You have got to try
this olive oil gelato.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.198
Oh, my God,
that's delicious.

16:22.285 --> 16:23.460
I know!

16:23.547 --> 16:24.461
You wouldn't think
it would work

16:24.548 --> 16:25.941
but it does.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.769
Boy, Carl did a great job.

16:27.856 --> 16:29.249
I mean, everything is perfect.

16:29.336 --> 16:30.598
You're very lucky woman.

16:30.685 --> 16:31.947
Yeah, well, so are you, girl.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.209
Mike is a wonderful man.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.211
Yeah, I know.

16:37.648 --> 16:39.085
And-and I mean,
and I did tell him

16:39.172 --> 16:40.695
you know, not to do anything
special tonight.

16:40.782 --> 16:44.438
But I didn't think
he'd run with it.

16:44.525 --> 16:47.310
I have to say,
this is one of the nicest

16:47.397 --> 16:49.095
Valentine's Days
I've ever had.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.357
Me too.

16:50.444 --> 16:51.575
[both laughing]

16:51.662 --> 16:54.013
It's kind of a perfect evening.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.405
I mean, yeah, I, you know

16:55.492 --> 16:57.190
I wish the guys were here.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.323
Sure.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.368
We need somebody to get
the cars and the coats.

17:01.455 --> 17:03.283
[laughing]

17:03.370 --> 17:04.632
Hey, ladies,
sorry we're late

17:04.719 --> 17:06.242
and we can't stay.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.591
Why? What's going on?

17:07.678 --> 17:09.550
This man
saved my life tonight.

17:09.637 --> 17:12.292
Come on, Carl, the girls don't
need to hear about my heroics.

17:12.379 --> 17:14.207
Technically, I saved
two lives tonight

17:14.294 --> 17:17.210
while valiantly battling
my own fear of heights.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.647
Wow. We got gelato.

17:22.563 --> 17:23.999
I'm glad you had
a good time.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.087
We need to head over
to the station

17:25.174 --> 17:27.350
and fill out some reports.

17:27.437 --> 17:28.873
- These are for you.
- Ah.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.527
- Oh
- They're beautiful.

17:30.614 --> 17:32.529
And these are for you.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.141
They're lovely.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.623
"Marry me
or I'll kill myself."

17:42.583 --> 17:43.932
Straight from the heart.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.371
Everything you do
is straight from the heart.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.808
I hope they pin a medal
on that big chest.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.027
- Goodnight, ladies.
- Goodnight.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.246
- See you at home.
- Night.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.812
I'd be happy to drive
if you want me to.

17:54.899 --> 17:57.467
Oh, no. I will man the chariot,
brave warrior.

18:00.514 --> 18:01.602
[instrumental music]

18:01.689 --> 18:02.994
[sighs]

18:05.649 --> 18:08.652
- Do you wanna dance?
- I thought you'd never ask.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.184
[instrumental music on TV]

18:18.271 --> 18:20.882
Even though I've seen
this movie dozens of times

18:20.969 --> 18:23.798
it never fails to melt
this tough exterior.

18:25.887 --> 18:28.890
Thanks for keeping
me company tonight.

18:28.977 --> 18:30.457
I really appreciate it.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.415
No problemo.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.330
And by the way,
if any of my friends

18:34.417 --> 18:38.029
or perhaps my mother
asked me what I did tonight

18:38.117 --> 18:40.989
would you be offended
if I told them I had a date?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.906
I wouldn't be offended
in the least.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.172
And you're more than welcome
to do the same.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.959
Thank you.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.483
I probably won't.

19:05.883 --> 19:08.103
"Breakfast At Tiffany's,"
I love that movie.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.154

19:19.810 --> 19:21.203
