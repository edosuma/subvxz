WEBVTT

00:04.250 --> 00:06.792
All right, to hang your picture properly,
we gotta find the support beam.

00:06.875 --> 00:08.625
This stud finder will show me where it is.

00:09.166 --> 00:11.458
-
- Ah, those things don't work.

00:11.709 --> 00:13.417
You gotta do it the old-fashioned way.

00:14.458 --> 00:16.500
-
- Jer--

00:16.583 --> 00:18.542
- Found it!
- Give me that!

00:26.000 --> 00:28.709
I'm proud of you, man. Look at you.
Your first tournament ribbon.

00:28.792 --> 00:31.208
I know man,
couldn't have done it without you.

00:31.291 --> 00:32.709
- Ah.
- Your support...

00:32.792 --> 00:34.959
your friendship, your jock strap.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.250
You used my jock--

00:38.875 --> 00:39.709
Just keep it.

00:40.959 --> 00:43.542
Hey, have you guys heard
that dumb Black Dragon radio jingle?

00:43.625 --> 00:45.875
- Oh...
- Oh. That thing's catchy, yo.

00:45.959 --> 00:48.458
<i>♪ We're the best, don't mind
bragging, so come and be... ♪</i>

00:48.542 --> 00:49.834

00:55.834 --> 00:57.458
Don't hate me for making it my own.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.458
Hey, Jerry, that thing you're watching
from the Seaford Animal Park,

01:02.542 --> 01:03.959
is making a weird sound.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.333
He's probably hungry.
I should go feed him.

01:06.875 --> 01:09.125
-
- Hey, little buddy.

01:09.208 --> 01:12.625
Aw, what a little cutie! What is it?

01:12.709 --> 01:14.291
It's a Peruvian Bush ferret.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.625
We gotta keep him separated
because these wiry little fellas,

01:16.709 --> 01:18.333
can get really wound up
around the females.

01:18.417 --> 01:19.750
Ah, I hear that.

01:21.959 --> 01:23.542
I mean, the poor thing.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.375
You know, Grandmaster Po,

01:28.417 --> 01:30.875
it's great that you're helping
the monastery find a home

01:30.959 --> 01:32.083
for this little guy.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.500
Thank you. You know--

01:33.583 --> 01:36.291
Well, the truth is I'm helping you
help the monastery help the boy,

01:36.417 --> 01:39.250
which means you couldn't help anyone
if I wasn't helping you.

01:40.041 --> 01:42.458
You're watching him for two days.
Get over it.

01:43.041 --> 01:44.083
Be good, Sam.

01:44.291 --> 01:45.959
Don't worry about me, Grandmaster.

01:46.041 --> 01:48.917
I'm sure I'll enjoy my time here
at the dojo with my new friends.

01:49.625 --> 01:52.542
And you can count on me, Grandmaster.
Won't let him out of my sight.

01:54.166 --> 01:55.291
Alright, somebody watch this kid

01:55.375 --> 01:57.125
I'm hitting the lunch buffet
at the bowling alley.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.917
Hi, little man. I'm Kim, and this is--

02:03.000 --> 02:06.583
Save it, blondie. I'm gonna need a car
with enough gas to get to Vegas.

02:10.875 --> 02:13.667
Listen, why don't we just go to the
food court and get you a pretzel?

02:13.750 --> 02:15.583
Won't you be busy calling your mommy?

02:15.667 --> 02:16.959
Why would I be calling my--

02:17.041 --> 02:18.834
Mommy?

02:18.917 --> 02:20.250
Gah!

02:21.083 --> 02:22.166
I got this.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.875
Hey, buddy.
Do you wanna help me feed my ferret?

02:26.959 --> 02:29.166
Whoa, I've never fed a ferret before.

He's just a little eight-year-old boy.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.834
To protect ourselves,
we had to lock him in your office.

03:29.917 --> 03:31.959
-
- Oh, no.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.375
It's my turn to check on him.

03:35.792 --> 03:36.917
You only wanted to watch the kid

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
so you'd look like a big deal
in front of the Grandmaster.

03:39.083 --> 03:41.417
I did it out of respect.

03:41.500 --> 03:45.041
The Grandmaster
is a world-renowned martial artist,

03:45.125 --> 03:47.917
a man of great honor and integrity.

03:48.375 --> 03:50.542
Plus, I'm hoping to use his condo
at the beach club.

03:50.625 --> 03:53.417
Oh-ho-ho, it is right
in the middle of bikini row!

03:55.583 --> 03:58.000
Whatever. You are not dumping
this monster off on us.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.750
- Monster? Oh, please.
-

04:02.458 --> 04:05.625
Ah! Gah!

04:05.709 --> 04:09.375
Rudy, you're gonna need more tape.

04:13.125 --> 04:14.667
We are not doing this alone, Rudy.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.959
Wha-- But I'm a Sensei.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.709
I've got the dojo to run.

04:19.083 --> 04:19.917
Uh...

04:21.000 --> 04:24.041
You know, Rudy, watching the kid
and running the dojo.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.750
Seems like you got a pretty full plate.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.375
- I do.
- I could take more of a leadership role.

04:28.875 --> 04:31.542
You know, help around the place,
teach some of your classes.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.917
I mean, between the two of us,
we got this.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.500
Nah, thanks, guys. But there's no way
I could leave my beloved dojo--

04:38.583 --> 04:39.750
Here are the keys.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.834
Yeah, every morning you have
to plunge the toilet and feed the cat.

04:42.917 --> 04:44.542
Do not mix those up.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.750
Dude, we're in charge!

04:48.834 --> 04:51.000
Oh, I've been waiting
for this for a long time.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.709
- I have some huge ideas.
- I got an idea of my own.

04:53.792 --> 04:57.166
See, it's Gis for beginners.
Inside they have airbags.

04:57.667 --> 04:58.959
Oh, hold on. I got one in my locker.

04:59.041 --> 05:01.667
Hey, uh, Jerry.
Why don't you go write those ideas down?

05:03.208 --> 05:04.709
Uh, I mean, so we don't forget them.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.000
We should probably get to work
on these chores anyway.

05:28.750 --> 05:31.041
Feeding the toilet... no problem.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.166
But woo! Tomorrow...

05:33.834 --> 05:35.083
you're plunging the cat.

05:39.542 --> 05:41.834
-
- I'm gonna ask you for the last time.

05:41.917 --> 05:43.792
To please stop doing that.

05:46.792 --> 05:49.834
Oh, he's just trying to have a little fun.

05:52.417 --> 05:53.834
I'm gonna go hit the can.

05:56.250 --> 05:57.792
Can't you put this kid in a cage?

05:57.875 --> 06:00.709
I'd love to, but kid cages
rub some people the wrong way.

06:01.834 --> 06:05.208
Look, inside every bad child
is a good child trying to get out.

06:05.291 --> 06:06.542
We just have to help him.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.917
What did you do?

06:14.000 --> 06:17.583
I shoved seven rolls of toilet paper
down the bowl before I flushed it.

06:19.500 --> 06:22.166
No! My pipes can't take
that kind of pressure.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.625
She's going to blow. She's going to blow!

06:34.125 --> 06:35.166
She blew.

06:39.750 --> 06:41.875
Punch. Block. Good.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.959
- Punch and block.
- Hey, what's going on?

06:44.041 --> 06:45.875
Uh, I'm teaching the 3,30 class.

06:45.959 --> 06:48.333
But the 3:30 class doesn't start
until 4:15.

06:49.917 --> 06:52.500
Jerry, since I've been in charge,
I've made some changes around here.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.500
I even got some new students.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.542
Students?

06:57.625 --> 06:58.917
Is that who these people are?

06:59.333 --> 07:01.875
Yo, white belt!
You're standing in my spot.

07:02.458 --> 07:06.417
It's called the Jerry zone,
so step off, not-Jerry.

07:06.834 --> 07:09.208
Hey, hey. Why don't you guys
just take five? Thanks.

07:09.834 --> 07:10.959
What's your problem?

07:11.041 --> 07:13.542
My problem is we're running
this dojo together.

07:13.917 --> 07:16.583
I have lots of great ideas
and you're not listening to any of them.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.917
You have lots of great ideas? Name one.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.834
Come to Bobby Wasabi's
and check out our...

07:21.917 --> 07:24.667
mooooooves!

07:26.208 --> 07:30.041
This thing's got satellite radio,
air conditioning and a microwave.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.375
-
- Ooh!

07:33.083 --> 07:34.041
Chimichanga?

07:35.709 --> 07:37.375
Please put that back where it came from.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.208
- Oh!
-

07:39.834 --> 07:42.542
- How are you powering all that?
- That's the genius, Jack.

07:42.625 --> 07:44.875
See, I strapped a car battery to each leg.

07:44.959 --> 07:46.834
This thing's powered up and ready to--

07:49.917 --> 07:51.917
Are you all right?
I think your suit is short circuiting.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Huh? Oh, no. No, it's not.

07:54.291 --> 07:56.583
- No, I'm perfectly...
-

07:56.667 --> 07:58.083
fine! Woo!

07:59.000 --> 08:03.333
- I couldn't be... better!
-

08:11.166 --> 08:13.375
Jerry, the new vision I have for the dojo,

08:13.458 --> 08:17.834
it's not about karate cows
or glow-rate or burning butt burritos.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.750
It's about my new training philosophy,

08:20.875 --> 08:23.750
based on three levels of focus,
honor and dedication.

08:23.834 --> 08:26.250
I call it "Jack's pyramid of discipline".

08:27.250 --> 08:30.250
Okay, first of all, that's not a pyramid.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.458
It's a triangle.

08:33.500 --> 08:37.000
Second, I can't believe you took
my picture down and put that thing up.

08:37.792 --> 08:39.625
And third, what about my ideas?

08:39.709 --> 08:41.250
Your ideas are dumb, dude.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.583
Oh?

08:47.166 --> 08:50.750
You know what, Jack?
You've changed. You've changed!

08:51.458 --> 08:53.125
I had to. I'm in charge now.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.458
Yeah?

08:55.208 --> 08:58.250
Well, with you in charge, I'm not sure
I want to be a part of this lame dojo.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.834
- Fine.
- Fine.

08:59.917 --> 09:00.959
Fine!

09:02.583 --> 09:04.375
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

09:04.750 --> 09:05.792
Dude...

09:05.875 --> 09:08.917
You know what hurts even more than your
hummus burning its way through my colon?

09:09.417 --> 09:11.291
Actually, I know no greater pain.

09:13.125 --> 09:15.166
The fact that my best
friend doesn't need me.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.083
Ah.

09:16.166 --> 09:18.458
I thought Jack and I
were gonna run the dojo together.

09:18.542 --> 09:20.625
You know, it's just like me
and my cousin Carl.

09:20.709 --> 09:23.917
We moved here together from Hachmachistan
and wanted to open up a restaurant.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.875
But we had very different ideas
on how to do the business.

09:26.959 --> 09:27.917
Like what?

09:28.000 --> 09:31.125
Well, for starters,
he wanted our meat to be actual meat.

09:31.208 --> 09:32.500
What?

09:33.333 --> 09:37.000
So he opened up Carl's Kabobs,
and I opened up my place.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.625
That's it! Oh!

09:43.083 --> 09:44.792
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

09:48.417 --> 09:51.291
You know, you've made a few enemies
since you've been here.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.875
But I think deep down inside of you
is a good kid.

09:53.959 --> 09:56.291
All you need is a little fresh air
and sunshine.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.875
Where's Milton?
And why won't Kim fish with us?

09:58.959 --> 10:01.917
I know Milton's around here somewhere.
And I'll go talk to Kim.

10:07.542 --> 10:08.417
Sam!

10:10.500 --> 10:14.792
I've been up all night thinking of what
you might try and pull out here today!

10:15.625 --> 10:17.542
What? I'm just a little boy fishing.

10:17.625 --> 10:20.000
I... I...

10:20.083 --> 10:21.750
I know it's only a matter of time

10:21.834 --> 10:24.291
before you try and trick me
into eating a worm.

10:29.542 --> 10:31.542
Ha! Beat you to it!

10:33.208 --> 10:35.458
What's next? The old hook-and-rip?

10:35.542 --> 10:37.500
See!

10:39.959 --> 10:42.625
Ha! Beat you to it!

10:46.208 --> 10:47.792
And for the grand finale,

10:47.875 --> 10:50.542
when I'm not looking,
attach a crab to my nose.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.417
Beat you to it.

11:02.250 --> 11:04.917
I want nothing to do with him, okay?
He's pure evil.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.583
Oh, he just needed
a little more Rudy time.

11:09.875 --> 11:12.417
- I caught a fish, Rudy. It's for you.
- Aah.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.417
Pure evil, huh?

11:15.083 --> 11:17.667
You! You stole my fish!

11:17.750 --> 11:18.750
What? No. He caught it.

11:18.834 --> 11:20.875
Ah!

11:25.250 --> 11:27.166
Might need a little more Rudy time.

11:32.709 --> 11:34.250
Hey, Jack, take a flyer.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.959
It's for the new business
that I opened with my partner.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.542
What?

11:39.834 --> 11:41.709
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

11:41.792 --> 11:42.792
Punch.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.417
Punch.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.417
You turned Phil's into a dojo?

11:46.500 --> 11:50.041
Not just a dojo, but a better dojo
than the one you're running.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.458
And one last thing, Jack.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.917
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step off my face.

12:05.417 --> 12:07.041

12:07.125 --> 12:10.667

on a roll out into a chest strike.

12:10.750 --> 12:12.709
Now watch. Gonna roll out...

12:13.375 --> 12:16.208
spin, chest strike. All right?

12:21.500 --> 12:22.834
Move it, zits. My turn.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.375
- What are you doing here?
- Relax, Jack.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.166
Just came to get some stuff
out of my locker.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.667
Yeah? Well, make it quick.

12:45.792 --> 12:48.291
I'm in the middle of class
with all of my new students.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.417
Oh, I just hope you don't do
to these students

12:50.500 --> 12:52.000
what you did to little Timmy Donovan.

12:53.583 --> 12:56.208
Oh, you didn't hear?

12:56.667 --> 12:59.458
Yeah, Jack pushed him
to do a move he wasn't ready for.

12:59.542 --> 13:02.583
Poor kid had to have
his whole skeleton removed.

13:03.083 --> 13:06.333
Oh, come on, you guys don't believe that.
It's not even possible.

13:06.417 --> 13:07.375
- Right?
- Yes, it is.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.709
Oh, yeah. Now Timmy just hangs
on his mother's clothesline

13:09.792 --> 13:11.500
making fun of kids that walk by.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.917
"Hey, you! Spines are for losers".

13:17.041 --> 13:18.166
Come on. That's not--

13:18.250 --> 13:20.083
- That's not true.
- Oh, would you look at that.

13:20.166 --> 13:23.000
The fancy new safe dojo
across the courtyard,

13:23.083 --> 13:27.083
is giving away free orange belts
with every order of hummus.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.083
What's all this stuff?

13:44.166 --> 13:46.458
Don't, don't, don't, don't touch this.

13:47.542 --> 13:49.583
It's the only thing you haven't destroyed.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.625
Just go back to your room
and take another nap.

13:51.709 --> 13:53.000
I already took two.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.542
No, your naps aren't for you,
they're for me, they help me relax.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.250
"The Battle of Pickford"?

13:58.333 --> 13:59.291
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

13:59.792 --> 14:01.250
Six months of awesome.

14:01.291 --> 14:04.041
It's an exact replica
down to the last detail.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.709
Even the cannons fire.

14:05.792 --> 14:07.792
Wow, this is the coolest hobby ever!

14:07.875 --> 14:09.667
That's not what my dates say.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.166
Why doesn't that horse have a rider?

14:13.667 --> 14:15.959
Ah, Colonel Pickford
should be riding that horse.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.834
Yeah, but the company that makes
the figurines went out of business,

14:18.917 --> 14:22.000
so my exact replica will never be exact.

14:22.083 --> 14:24.709
It's all right, Rudy.
Someday you'll get your Colonel Pickford.

14:25.208 --> 14:26.041
You think so?

14:27.250 --> 14:31.083
-
- Ah!

14:32.542 --> 14:35.125
I'm so sorry! I swear
that was an accident!

14:35.208 --> 14:36.333
You...

14:37.375 --> 14:38.834
Look what you've done!

14:40.166 --> 14:42.917
Everything is destroyed!

14:44.417 --> 14:45.625
Not everything.

14:45.709 --> 14:48.959
- Um, this cannon still looks like...
-

14:52.417 --> 14:55.291
Uh... I'm gonna go take another nap.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.542
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

14:59.625 --> 15:00.792
Kick.

15:01.417 --> 15:02.709
- Kick.
-

15:02.792 --> 15:04.625
You know what that means!

15:04.959 --> 15:06.875
Dance break!

15:10.542 --> 15:12.834
Hey, Sensei. Check out my moves.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.041
Woo!

15:23.291 --> 15:28.667
This establishment is in violation
of code 681-niner.

15:28.750 --> 15:32.166
Operating a dojo inside
of a falafel restaurant.

15:32.750 --> 15:35.250
Ha! Joke's on you!

15:35.291 --> 15:38.083
I don't have permits for either of those.

15:39.709 --> 15:45.000
Any accomplices found on the premises
of said dojo-falafel establishment...

15:45.083 --> 15:47.583
will be taken into custody!

15:47.667 --> 15:49.875
Hi, one free lesson
at The Bobby Wasabi Dojo.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.083
Have a good day.

15:52.792 --> 15:53.709
Huh!

15:56.583 --> 15:58.542
I should have known it was you, Jack.

15:58.959 --> 16:01.625
Can't stand seeing a better dojo, can you?

16:01.709 --> 16:04.000
Oh, this? This isn't a dojo. It's a joke.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.750
- Oh, really?
- Mm hmm.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.875
Then why don't we have
a little tournament, huh?

16:09.375 --> 16:12.709
Winner gets to run
the Bobby Wasabi Dojo... their way.

16:13.375 --> 16:16.083
All right. You want a Battle Of The Dojos?

16:16.458 --> 16:17.959
- Let's do it.

16:18.041 --> 16:19.458
- Fine.
Fine!

16:21.792 --> 16:25.375
This is gonna be so easy.
The only student you have left is Joan.

16:31.375 --> 16:34.250
Well, the only student
you have left is Phil.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.750
It's ticklish.

16:39.875 --> 16:42.458
Uh, we got this, Jack.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.041
I'm gonna mop up the floor
with this chump.

16:45.125 --> 16:48.041
No one mops these floors... ever!

16:50.458 --> 16:52.166
Po's gonna be here any minute.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.000
I guess you'll be glad to see me go.

16:54.709 --> 16:55.917
Aw, Sam...

16:57.083 --> 16:58.667
I really, really will.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.750
I almost forgot. I have something for you.

17:05.875 --> 17:08.250
- What's this?
- It's Colonel Pickford.

17:08.333 --> 17:11.041
I made it out of a clothespin,
a half-chewed gumdrop,

17:11.125 --> 17:12.583
and the saber's a toenail clipping.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.542
This is the best...

17:15.917 --> 17:18.959
and worst thing anyone's ever given me.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.917
Why are you always such a troublemaker?

17:24.375 --> 17:26.041
I mean, don't you want a family
to like you?

17:26.125 --> 17:27.792
I've never had a family before.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.291
I mean, are they really that important?

17:30.875 --> 17:31.959
Yeah, Sam.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.625
Being a part of a family
is very important.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.250
Look, if you could stay here...

17:42.417 --> 17:45.667
with us, is there any chance
that you could behave yourself?

17:45.750 --> 17:48.000
I can try, but I can't promise anything.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.083
Why don't you stay with me?

17:52.458 --> 17:55.291
Really, Rudy? Whoa, thanks!

17:56.041 --> 17:57.000
I'll go talk to Po.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.291
Rudy! Rudy! I got your text.
What's the emergency?

18:00.375 --> 18:02.333
Oh, Kim. That was from me.

18:02.417 --> 18:03.959
I didn't want you to be late
for your date.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.166
For my what now?

18:06.333 --> 18:09.417
You know the geek who works
at Komputer Kingdom with the face fungus?

18:10.041 --> 18:10.875
Yeah.

18:10.959 --> 18:14.000
I told him that if he met you here,
you'd give him a kiss.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.375
You did not say--

18:16.792 --> 18:18.250
Pucker up, Princess.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.000
Sam, that was...

18:25.667 --> 18:27.500
...really funny.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.542
Nice.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.417
- Breathe, breathe, breathe...
-

18:37.500 --> 18:38.750
- Okay. Open.
-

18:38.834 --> 18:40.333
- Good.
-

18:42.667 --> 18:44.542
Joan, that wasn't a spit bucket,
that was my shoe.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.208
Jack, I am in the zone.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.583
I have razor-sharp focus.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.250
I will not be distracted. I will--

18:52.291 --> 18:55.709
Oh, hi, Todd! Woo!
Someone's been working out.

18:55.792 --> 18:58.709
Your glutes are beauts. Ha-ha!

18:58.792 --> 19:00.625
Wow! Yeah!

19:00.709 --> 19:01.792
What?

19:03.750 --> 19:06.458
I see your dumb triangle
is still where my picture should be.

19:06.542 --> 19:07.959
Yeah, you probably threw it out.

19:08.041 --> 19:10.750
No, no, you probably shredded it
into a thousand little pieces!

19:10.834 --> 19:13.250
Actually, I had it enlarged.

19:14.875 --> 19:16.583
See, I was gonna hang it up,
but then you went--

19:16.667 --> 19:18.208
- You kicked me out.
- I didn't kick you out.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.750
You're the one who decided to leave.

19:19.834 --> 19:23.083
Well, that's because you didn't respect me
and said all my ideas were dumb.

19:24.667 --> 19:25.834
Well, I shouldn't have said that.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.375
Because actually,
you had some pretty good ideas.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.083
Yes. Yes, I did.

19:33.166 --> 19:34.166
So, uh...

19:35.166 --> 19:36.291
which one was good?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.959
Your idea for Gis with airbags.

19:39.041 --> 19:42.291
Oh, yeah. For beginners.
It takes the fear out of being hit.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.709
Yeah, I've been using the one out
of your locker. People love 'em.

19:44.792 --> 19:45.959
Hey, Donnie, come here.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.959
Nice. Hey, uh, Jerry?

19:56.333 --> 19:58.125
I've always dreamed of running a dojo.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.709
When I got the chance,
maybe I got a little carried away.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.542
I should never have disrespected you.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.917
The truth is the dojo
isn't the same without you, man.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.959
You had me at, Jerry,
I've always dreamed of running a dojo,

20:09.041 --> 20:11.333
and when I got the chance,
maybe I got a little carried away,

20:11.375 --> 20:12.250
I should have never--

20:12.333 --> 20:13.917
I think I know
where you're going with this.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.917
Hey, what do you say we call off
this little tournament

20:19.000 --> 20:19.917
before someone gets hurt?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.709
- Yeah.
-

20:41.709 --> 20:45.291
I'm okay! I just landed
on this really big kid.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.875
Holy Hannah, I think I popped him!

20:50.417 --> 20:52.375
<i>♪ Kickin it with you! ♪</i>

20:55.875 --> 20:58.792
Men, you are no longer without a leader.

20:59.542 --> 21:04.041
Colonel Pickford has arrived to lead you
over the ridge and down into the valley.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.792
Now you should know that you will be
turned into human confetti

21:06.875 --> 21:08.709
by close-range enemy cannon fire,

21:08.792 --> 21:12.166
due to Colonel Pickford's
legendarily poor judgment.

21:13.041 --> 21:16.709
Sam, you have the honor
of placing Pickford on his noble steed.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.834
We have got to find another hobby.

21:57.250 --> 21:59.041
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.041 --> 22:02.917
