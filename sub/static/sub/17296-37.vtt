Tonight, countless superheroes
came out to prove

00:24.692 --> 00:26.194
they have what it takes

00:26.227 --> 00:28.129
to impress our panel of judges.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.064
Batman, Superman,

00:30.098 --> 00:32.766
Aquaman, and Wonder Woman.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.068
The search has officially begun

00:34.102 --> 00:36.837
as in, oh snap, right now!

00:36.870 --> 00:37.838
To find out who can fill

00:37.871 --> 00:40.341
one very important
position on...

00:40.374 --> 00:42.476
The Justice League.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.633
Big welcome to this year's
competition,

01:05.666 --> 01:08.202
- I'm your host...
- Birdarang!

01:08.236 --> 01:09.670
That's my name,
don't wear it out.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.640
I cannot believe we are
actually going to audition

01:12.673 --> 01:14.708
for the spot
on the Justice League!

01:14.742 --> 01:17.111
So many A-list heroes.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.180
Ah, Wonder Woman.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.318
Wait!

01:24.352 --> 01:25.819
Ain't we already on a team?

01:25.853 --> 01:28.156
Yeah, but we want to be on,
you know, a good team.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.191
Oh, I totally gets that.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.225
I don't know.

01:31.259 --> 01:33.461
Looks like a lot of heroes
turned up this year.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.329
Think you guys got a chance?

01:35.363 --> 01:36.764
Of course, we have a chance.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.865
We are awesome!

01:37.898 --> 01:39.600
Check this out! Ka-blammo!

01:39.633 --> 01:41.735
And I can be any animal
in the world.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.805
Who else but the I can do
the speed, the strength,

01:44.838 --> 01:46.674
and the shooting
of the eyeball lasers?

01:46.707 --> 01:49.210
That's nothing compared
to my dark magic.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.413
I will destroy the competition!

01:52.446 --> 01:55.283
And I've got a sweet jump kick.

01:56.217 --> 01:59.220
Oh, yeah, you don't
have superpowers.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.621
Well, you're in luck,

02:00.654 --> 02:02.523
because this isn't
a superpower competition.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.293
We're trying to peep someone
who is not just super,

02:05.326 --> 02:06.694
but super special.

02:06.727 --> 02:07.661
Ha! That's me.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.630
I know, because my mom told me.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.599
Once the auditions got underway,

02:11.632 --> 02:14.535
things went from bad to,
"Oh, no, he didn't!"

02:14.568 --> 02:16.204
But despite the odds,

02:16.237 --> 02:18.872
one contestant seemed
very sure of himself.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.508
My name is Robin.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.510
I'm a crime-fighting vigilante,

02:22.543 --> 02:25.279
and I have
a very strong jawline.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.080
Epic, yo!

02:27.114 --> 02:28.916
What do you think
your chances are to win?

02:28.949 --> 02:31.852
Let's just say I'm pretty good
friends with one of the judges.

02:31.885 --> 02:36.257
But you probably want to hear my very
sad and melodramatic back story.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.760
You see, I didn't have
a regular childhood.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.230
I grew up in the circus.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.264
I was 8 years old

02:43.297 --> 02:46.500
and doing the tightrope
without a net.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.370
Gosh, growing up in the circus
sounds super fly!

02:49.403 --> 02:51.272
Yes, it was...
Wait, no.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.241
There's a sad part, too.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.409
What's sad about riding unicycles
and chilling with clowns?

02:55.443 --> 02:57.378
I know growing up
in the circus sounds fun,

02:57.411 --> 02:58.145
but it wasn't.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.913
I need you to feel sorry for me

02:59.947 --> 03:01.349
so I can win, please.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.783
Feel sorry for me.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.184
No diggity.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.354
Yo, Batman!

03:06.387 --> 03:07.688
What's up, bro-ham!

03:07.721 --> 03:09.357
You better not play
favorites, big man.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.524
Wink! Wink!

03:16.297 --> 03:18.399
Uh, so, for my talent

03:18.432 --> 03:21.435
I'll be doing
a motorcycle trick.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.356
Wait, please...

03:43.457 --> 03:44.558
Don't you touch that buzz...

03:44.592 --> 03:46.327
You can't do this to me.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.696
Batman, you like me, right?

03:49.763 --> 03:51.799
This was my dream!

03:51.832 --> 03:54.468
My one shot
at the Justice League.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.510
They didn't even
give me a chance.

04:02.543 --> 04:05.012
It's not fair.
It's just not fair.

04:05.045 --> 04:06.947
I grew up in the circus!

04:06.980 --> 04:08.349
And cut.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.017
That clip is dope.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.920
Wait, you're not really
going to use that, right?

04:12.953 --> 04:14.388
That was a private moment.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.290
Sure was, real embarrassing too.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.891
Let's see it again.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.793
After seriously
busting up Batman,

04:19.827 --> 04:23.364
the only thing Robin could
feel sorry for was himself.

04:23.397 --> 04:25.833
It's not fair.
It's just not fair.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.801
I grew up in the circus!

04:29.337 --> 04:30.538
Meanwhile,

04:30.571 --> 04:32.840
other contestants prepared
for their auditions,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.343
with talents ranging
from mind-blowing

04:35.376 --> 04:36.510
to heartwarming.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.380
Oh, well done, Mr. Sparkles.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.815
I have always loved
the small felines.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.518
We do not have them
where I come from.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.987
You see, I am not from here.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.523
I'm from a far off world.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.592
The planet Tamaran.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.361
There, I was a princess,

04:53.394 --> 04:56.530
next in line to become queen
of the entire planet.

04:56.564 --> 04:59.099
But I was betrayed

04:59.132 --> 05:01.335
by my own sister!

05:03.804 --> 05:06.106
She exiled me from my planet

05:06.139 --> 05:07.341
and I came to the Earth,

05:07.375 --> 05:12.546
where I fell in love with these
sweet little balls of the fur.

05:15.015 --> 05:18.352
Hello, I am Starfire.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.520
For your consideration,

05:19.553 --> 05:23.424
I present
the Circus of the Felines.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.925
The ta-da!

05:26.460 --> 05:28.028
Through the hoop,
Mr. Sparkles!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.062
Through the hoop!

05:30.864 --> 05:32.032
Hurray!

05:34.635 --> 05:37.438
Now, Mrs. Buttons will
play the soccer.

05:40.741 --> 05:45.446
And, um, next, Mr. Fluffles
will recite the Shakespeare!

05:51.118 --> 05:56.023
And for the final and
most spectacular of the acts,

05:56.056 --> 05:58.792
Mr. Twinkle Bow!

06:06.467 --> 06:08.802
Aw, nerdle gruts.

06:08.836 --> 06:11.138
This is the part where
I interview the loser

06:11.171 --> 06:12.873
to see if they're gonna cry.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.675
So, gonna cry?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.810
Why would I do the crying?

06:16.844 --> 06:19.012
I gave it the best effort

06:19.046 --> 06:22.382
and this is not the last
you will see of me.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.555
Whoomp, there it is!

06:27.588 --> 06:29.757
My dream of winning
this competition

06:29.790 --> 06:33.861
will not become the reality!

06:35.529 --> 06:38.499
- Tissue?
- No, thank you.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.167
I have the kittens.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.738
Starfire wasn't the only one

06:44.772 --> 06:46.507
the judges didn't give props to.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.909
Up next is Cyborg.

06:48.942 --> 06:51.779
Half man, half robot, all fresh.

06:51.812 --> 06:55.549
But will he be able to hit
his high notes?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.588
Or will he be the one
who cracks under pressure?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.991
My dream was to be
a football star.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.460
The coaches said I could
have gone all the way, too.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.562
But then I was in
a horrible accident.

07:08.596 --> 07:09.930
I was rebuilt as a cyborg.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.899
And then I changed
my name to Cyborg.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.634
Didn't wanna overthink it,
you know.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.904
Point is... It wasn't long
before I found a new passion.

07:17.505 --> 07:18.572
Singing.

07:18.606 --> 07:20.207
Singing is the only thing
I've got in this world,

07:20.240 --> 07:21.709
if you don't count all
my cool superpowers,

07:21.742 --> 07:23.176
all my cool superhero friends,

07:23.210 --> 07:24.678
and all the cool superhero
things I do every day.

07:24.712 --> 07:25.913
I'm not counting it
if you're not.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.015
In that case,
I have had a hard life.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.050
But if I could be
on the Justice League...

07:30.083 --> 07:31.685
Whoo, doggy!

07:36.657 --> 07:37.958
Hi!

07:37.991 --> 07:40.994
Uh, I'm Cyborg from the Titans.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.696
Uh, the Teen Titans.

07:42.730 --> 07:45.966
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.
Hi, Wonder Woman.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.203
Okay, I'm gonna sing
for you now.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.662
I'm so jealous that he won.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.597
Wait, did you just film that?

09:23.631 --> 09:24.732
Word!

Raven has an unwelcome
surprise from her evil dad.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.106
Hi, I'm Raven.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.742
Growing up,
my dad always wanted me

09:34.775 --> 09:35.743
to follow in his footsteps.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.178
You know, destroy the world
with evil magic.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.279
He doesn't approve,

09:39.312 --> 09:41.281
but all I ever wanted to do was...

09:41.314 --> 09:42.816
Dance.

Raven, demons don't dance, sweetie.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.208
My dad thinks demons don't dance,

10:08.241 --> 10:10.744
but I plan on proving
him wrong tonight.

10:10.778 --> 10:11.845
In style.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.413
I spent the last two weeks

10:13.446 --> 10:15.849
making this outfit
for tonight's performance.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.317
Isn't it beautiful?

10:18.886 --> 10:20.754
No!

10:22.355 --> 10:24.357
Dad, how could you?

10:24.391 --> 10:26.193
For the last time, Raven.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.662
Demons don't dance!

10:28.696 --> 10:30.831
Oh, snap! It just got real.

10:30.864 --> 10:32.265
Will Raven be able to perform,

10:32.299 --> 10:34.868
or will she finally have to
hang up her dancing shoes?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.369
Find out next time on
