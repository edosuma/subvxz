00:49.125 --> 00:50.661
It's funny, you know,

00:50.667 --> 00:52.658
the kind of stuff
that pops into your head

00:52.667 --> 00:55.659
when you're trying to work.

00:55.667 --> 00:58.124
I remember
there was this horse--

00:58.125 --> 00:59.661
a golden palomino.

00:59.667 --> 01:03.114
Old Man McGinty had got him
in a trade, I think.

01:03.125 --> 01:07.164
I couldn't have been much more
than nine or ten at the time,

01:07.667 --> 01:11.159
but I'd made up my mind
I was going to ride that horse.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.658
'Course,
knowing Old Man McGinty,

01:13.667 --> 01:16.158
that was going
to take some doing.

01:37.709 --> 01:42.157
Well, first off,
there was his dog, Hector.

01:42.166 --> 01:45.704
They didn't come any meaner
or louder than Hector.

01:45.709 --> 01:48.200
One whiff of me
heading for that corral,

01:48.208 --> 01:51.700
and Hector'd have the old man
down on me like a shot.

01:55.709 --> 01:57.700
So much for Hector.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.741
Well, I remember
thinking to myself

02:16.208 --> 02:19.200
as that palomino stared at me
from across the corral

02:19.750 --> 02:23.197
with a real kind of
proud and angry look,

02:23.208 --> 02:28.748
that if ever there was a time
for turning back, this was it.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.741
But something else
must have decided

02:31.250 --> 02:32.740
our paths
were bound to cross that day,

02:32.750 --> 02:36.242
'cause, well, my feet
just kept right on going.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.783
Now, having a golden palomino
in a corral

03:14.792 --> 03:17.283
is all well and good,

03:17.291 --> 03:19.782
but actually getting
right up to her,

03:19.792 --> 03:24.286
well, that could be a whole
'nother ball game.

03:24.291 --> 03:25.827
She was starting to look

03:25.834 --> 03:28.280
a little bit bigger
than I remembered, too.

03:30.834 --> 03:34.827
No, there was definitely more
to riding this palomino

03:34.834 --> 03:37.280
than had occurred to me
the night before.

03:40.834 --> 03:44.326
Psst! Psst!

03:49.333 --> 03:51.824
They didn't say anything to me
about any survivors.

03:51.834 --> 03:54.325
The missile--
which tent?

04:03.333 --> 04:04.869
You might want to pass the time

04:04.875 --> 04:06.866
by cutting yourself
a little elbow room.

04:13.333 --> 04:14.869
Hey,

04:14.875 --> 04:16.331
I want that knife back,
you know.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.866
I'd always heard
in riding horses,

04:31.875 --> 04:34.867
it was the horse
that did the sweating,

04:35.375 --> 04:36.865
but I wasn't even on him yet,

04:36.875 --> 04:40.868
and you could have wrung enough
out of me to water the lawn.

04:45.917 --> 04:47.908
From here on,
it was easy does it.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.373
If you move too sudden,

04:51.375 --> 04:53.366
or worse,
try jumping on her back,

04:53.375 --> 04:55.912
and you might just as well
strap yourself to a...

04:55.917 --> 04:57.373
well, to a rocket.

05:59.458 --> 06:03.451
All right, hotshot,
so you got a golden palomino

06:03.458 --> 06:06.450
between your knees,
and no reins.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.449
Now what?

07:01.000 --> 07:02.490
Cavalry should be here
any minute.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.989
Now.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.030
God, I hate heights.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.073
What are you doing?!

08:08.583 --> 08:10.073
Making a rocket thruster.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.574
What are we doing?!

08:18.583 --> 08:22.576
I'll tell you later!

09:46.000 --> 09:48.707
Come on, Mac,
I've had Big Brothers before.

09:48.709 --> 09:50.165
None of them lived
in a place like this.

09:50.166 --> 09:52.157
Well, it's comfy;
I call it home.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.702
I thought
you had to be real normal

09:53.709 --> 09:55.165
to be somebody's Big Brother.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.702
I mean, this ain't
a normal place to live.

09:57.166 --> 09:58.155
This is weird.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.157
People a lot taller
than yourself

10:00.709 --> 10:02.700
have said the exact same thing.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.200
I think it's interesting.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.698
Okay, it's interesting.

10:06.709 --> 10:07.698
Now can I see Venus?

10:07.709 --> 10:09.199
Well, you
will be able to

10:09.208 --> 10:11.699
once that cloud clears.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.197
Tell you what,
in the meantime,

10:13.709 --> 10:15.199
what do you say we go down and
get a bite to eat?

10:15.208 --> 10:16.698
Okay.

10:23.208 --> 10:24.744
State Department vehicle

10:25.208 --> 10:26.197
J-one-seven-six-five

10:26.208 --> 10:28.745
requesting entry access
to KIVA Level One.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.744
Clearance request granted.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.206
Proceed to Level One.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.741
Will you excuse me,
please?

10:52.750 --> 10:54.240
Oh, yeah, I see what you mean.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.740
Okay, that's the discrepancy.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.240
Okay, uh...

10:57.250 --> 10:58.740
Dr. Marlowe,

10:58.750 --> 11:00.240
our director Dr.
Burke was delayed,

11:00.250 --> 11:01.239
so on behalf of Dr. Steubens

11:01.750 --> 11:02.739
and the Sendrex Corporation,

11:02.750 --> 11:04.786
I'd like to welcome you to
the KIVA Laboratories.

11:04.792 --> 11:05.781
Thank you.

11:05.792 --> 11:07.248
Oh, I'm Barbara Spencer.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.241
Oh, yes, his assistant.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.787
He's mentioned you
in his letters.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.783
Oh, Dr. Steube
ns is waiting for us

11:13.792 --> 11:14.781
down on the third level.

11:14.792 --> 11:15.781
Follow me, please.

11:15.792 --> 11:16.781
The elevators are this way.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.241
If you'll just stand completely
within this circle,

11:21.250 --> 11:22.239
this will only take a moment.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.784
Spencer, Barbara, T.

11:33.792 --> 11:36.283
G-L-seven-seven-three,
clearance to Level Three.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.280
Such tight security.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.280
Should I be flattered?

11:38.291 --> 11:40.782
Standard procedure,
I'm afraid.

11:40.792 --> 11:43.283
The KIVA has
the most advanced security

11:43.291 --> 11:44.827
of all the Sendrex Corporations.

11:45.291 --> 11:46.280
Nothing moves in
or out of here

11:46.291 --> 11:48.282
that isn't constantly
monitored and controlled.

11:59.291 --> 12:02.283
Sidney, dear Sidney,
how are you?

12:02.291 --> 12:03.827
I'm great.

12:03.834 --> 12:05.324
It's good to see you, Carl.

12:05.834 --> 12:07.825
Well, shall we start with a
little tour of the facilities?

12:07.834 --> 12:10.325
Uh, no, I've changed my mind
about that.

12:10.834 --> 12:14.827
We have a serious matter
to settle face-to-face.

12:14.834 --> 12:17.826
As I recall your last telex,

12:17.834 --> 12:20.826
it was Queen to Bishop Four.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.322
Yes.

12:22.333 --> 12:23.823
Correct?

12:23.834 --> 12:26.871
You countered with
Rook to Kings Fifth.

12:26.875 --> 12:28.331
Uh, pure suicide,

12:28.333 --> 12:31.325
but far be it from
me to stop you, Carl.

12:41.333 --> 12:42.869
It's your move, Carl.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.867
Oh, I know.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.366
I'm sorry, Sidney.

13:34.417 --> 13:37.909
Acid leak, Level Three.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.408
Containment out of control.

13:40.417 --> 13:45.411
Acid leak, Level Three.
Containment out of control.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.449
Tell me you were just
in a hurry to see me,

14:09.458 --> 14:10.447
and there's no bad news.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.948
Uh, I was just in a hurry
to see you,

14:11.959 --> 14:14.450
and, uh, I'll save the bad news
till we get inside.

14:14.458 --> 14:15.447
Uh, Gant.

14:15.959 --> 14:19.451
Gant... come on,
let's have it.

14:21.959 --> 14:23.950
All right.

14:23.959 --> 14:24.994
An accident in New Mexico.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.449
A lab that handles
a lot of classified research.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.449
Something set off
a series of explosions.

14:29.458 --> 14:30.447
How bad?

14:30.458 --> 14:31.447
Well, most of the
personnel got out,

14:32.001 --> 14:32.990
but at least 20 are
still unaccounted for.

14:33.001 --> 14:35.993
Among them is a top British
scientist named Marlowe.

14:36.001 --> 14:38.447
He was here visiting
one of our own men, Steubens.

14:38.458 --> 14:41.450
They're also both candidates
for the Nobel Prize this year.

14:41.458 --> 14:42.994
Not exactly
the kind of publicity

14:43.001 --> 14:44.491
the State Department
wants to hear.

14:45.001 --> 14:45.990
They still alive?

14:46.001 --> 14:46.990
They survived the blast,

14:47.001 --> 14:47.990
but they're still trapped
in the lab.

14:48.001 --> 14:49.992
They calculate
the chances

14:50.001 --> 14:52.993
of anyone getting through
to Marlowe and Steubens as...

14:54.500 --> 14:56.491
Well, it's not great.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.991
Well, give me ''not gre
at'' on a scale of one to ten.

14:59.001 --> 14:59.990
Minus three.

15:00.001 --> 15:02.993
That's why we couldn't
order anyone to try.

15:03.001 --> 15:05.492
So, uh,
your name came up.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.490
What other optio
ns do they have?

15:10.000 --> 15:10.989
I'm it, aren't I?

15:11.500 --> 15:12.489
You're it.

15:13.500 --> 15:14.489
Now look, Mac,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.491
you don't have to take
this assignment, you know that.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.992
Call the lab, Gant, and
tell 'em we're on our way.

15:38.542 --> 15:40.533
I think we may
be getting through again.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.533
Dr. Marlowe?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.531
Dr. Steubens?

15:43.542 --> 15:45.533
Can you hear me?

15:45.542 --> 15:47.533
Gentlemen, can you hear me?

15:47.542 --> 15:50.534
Yes, just-just-just a little.

15:50.542 --> 15:53.534
I-I think... Carl is

15:53.542 --> 15:56.534
regaining consciousness,
but we... we do need

15:57.041 --> 15:58.531
a doctor down here.

16:00.041 --> 16:01.030
Dr. Marlowe?

16:01.041 --> 16:02.030
Hello.

16:02.041 --> 16:03.030
Do you hear me?

16:03.041 --> 16:04.030
Hello.

16:04.583 --> 16:05.572
Sorry, sir, we lost it.

16:05.583 --> 16:07.039
Keep trying.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.072
Colonel Keel.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.573
Gantner.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.574
Attention, please.

16:39.583 --> 16:43.576
All Sendrex clearances must be
approved on a priority basis.

16:43.583 --> 16:47.075
Check at your substation
command post.

16:47.625 --> 16:49.616
Oh, Ed, I see
you've already met Colonel Keel.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.081
I better keep things
moving outside.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.081
I'll check in with you later.
Good.

16:53.083 --> 16:55.074
Charlie Burke, this is MacGyver.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.619
Charlie's director of the lab.

16:56.625 --> 16:57.614
Thank you for coming.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.614
How does it
stand right now?

16:59.083 --> 17:00.072
Well, Marlowe's fine.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.619
Steubens was unconscious
for a while,

17:01.625 --> 17:02.614
but he's coming around.

17:03.083 --> 17:04.618
We've been unable to maintain
any communication

17:04.625 --> 17:06.115
for more than
a few seconds at a time.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.615
You got any idea
what set it off?

17:07.625 --> 17:09.115
An explosion
on the third level

17:09.125 --> 17:10.615
somehow made its way
to the first,

17:10.625 --> 17:11.614
and past that
we're guessing.

17:11.625 --> 17:13.115
Uh, any chance
it could have had

17:13.125 --> 17:14.615
anything to do
with their research?

17:14.625 --> 17:16.616
No, no, no, no,
Steubens' research

17:16.625 --> 17:18.616
had to do with magnetic
fields in the ozone layer.

17:18.625 --> 17:20.616
Rainmakers?
Yeah.

17:20.625 --> 17:22.115
You're sure this
was an accident, right?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.116
Given the security
of the KIVA Laboratories,

17:24.125 --> 17:25.661
I don't see how it
could be anything else.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.114
Yeah, right.

17:27.125 --> 17:28.661
Have you got somebody
I can talk specifics with?

17:28.667 --> 17:30.658
Andy Colson
is our Chief of Operations.

17:30.667 --> 17:33.124
All right, let's have him. That ten
hours can't be gettin' any longer.

17:33.125 --> 17:34.114
Get Colson down here.

17:34.125 --> 17:36.662
Now we started
to drill an air hole

17:36.667 --> 17:38.123
from the outside,
but we had to stop.

17:38.667 --> 17:39.122
Why is that?

17:39.667 --> 17:40.656
We hit sulfuric acid.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.116
The explosion must have
ruptured one of the tanks,

17:43.667 --> 17:45.658
and it's, uh, well,
it's leaking into the ground.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.155
Has it reached the aquifer yet?

17:47.166 --> 17:48.155
Oh, whoa. What's that?

17:48.667 --> 17:49.656
Aquifer.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.656
It's a, uh, layer
of underground water,

17:51.166 --> 17:53.157
in this case it leads
directly into the Rio Grande.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.155
Now if the acid
hits the river,

17:54.166 --> 17:56.657
we're gonna poison
most of this state,

17:56.667 --> 17:58.157
Texas and Mexico.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.155
What can you do about it?

17:59.667 --> 18:00.656
Well, we can neutralize it.

18:00.667 --> 18:01.656
But in order to do that,
we have to flood

18:02.166 --> 18:04.157
the entire complex
with sodium hydroxide.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.703
What's that?

18:06.709 --> 18:08.165
Let's just say
it's the same stuff

18:08.166 --> 18:10.703
they use to clean
the flesh off of skeletons.

18:10.709 --> 18:12.165
You're kidding.

18:12.166 --> 18:14.157
Is that true?

18:14.166 --> 18:14.700
Yeah.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.157
There's a convoy of tankers
on the way right now.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.702
So it's not ten hours anymore?

18:19.709 --> 18:22.155
No. Uh, given the rate
of the flow of the acid,

18:22.709 --> 18:25.200
I'd say you have a little
under five hours, my friend.

18:25.208 --> 18:27.699
Boy, you're just takin' all
the fun out of this, Charlie.

18:27.709 --> 18:29.199
Will you show me
where that tank is?

18:29.709 --> 18:31.700
Right there.

18:31.709 --> 18:33.700
Third level, 300 feet
below ground.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.698
You Colson?

18:37.208 --> 18:38.197
That's right.

18:38.208 --> 18:39.197
You must be
the screwball.

18:39.208 --> 18:40.698
Andy, come on.

18:41.208 --> 18:42.698
Yeah... it doesn't make
much sense to go over

18:42.709 --> 18:43.698
every level right now.

18:43.709 --> 18:45.199
If you can wire me
for two-way,

18:45.208 --> 18:46.744
you can fill me in
as I get to each one.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.742
First problem, though,
is to get me inside.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.206
Have you got any
ideas on that?

18:51.750 --> 18:53.206
The only way to get
down to the first level

18:53.208 --> 18:54.744
right now is through
the elevator.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.206
We can't even op
en the doors up here.

18:56.750 --> 18:58.741
The whole shaft is
protected by lasers.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.206
Infrared
or gas discharge?

19:00.208 --> 19:01.197
Gas.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.741
CO2, 10,000 watts.

19:03.750 --> 19:06.742
You boys take your elevator
shafts pretty seriously.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.741
Spare a cigarette?

19:09.750 --> 19:11.240
Oh, sure.

19:13.750 --> 19:14.739
Thank you.

19:14.750 --> 19:15.739
Take the pack,
why don't you?

19:16.250 --> 19:17.239
You want my lighter, too?

19:17.750 --> 19:19.240
No, thanks.
I carry my own matches.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.239
Now this wiring duct here.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.240
It looks like it runs
into the elevator shaft.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.239
Does it?

19:23.250 --> 19:24.239
Yeah, it does.

19:24.792 --> 19:25.781
And it's got a grate
on the opening,

19:25.792 --> 19:27.248
but that's not gonna
do you any good.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.786
You're still gonna
draw the laser there.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.781
That's what I'm countin' on.

19:29.792 --> 19:31.783
Can you get me inside?

19:31.792 --> 19:34.249
You know, you're not gon
na be able to see that laser.

19:34.792 --> 19:35.247
Can you?

19:35.792 --> 19:37.248
Yeah, I can get you in.

19:37.792 --> 19:38.781
You know, it's gonna
take a lot more

19:39.250 --> 19:40.239
than you can car
ry in that knapsack

19:40.792 --> 19:41.781
to get you through all this.

19:41.792 --> 19:44.249
Well, the bag's not
for what I take, Colson.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.787
It's for what
I find along the way.

19:56.291 --> 19:59.283
MacGyver, that mik
e is voice-activated.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.280
All you've gotta do is talk.

20:00.792 --> 20:01.281
We'll be listening.

20:01.792 --> 20:02.281
Okeydoke.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.290
Ed, relax.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.827
I've got a big date on Sunday.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.828
I'm playin' ball
with my Little Brother.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.324
Well, I've reached the grate.

20:35.333 --> 20:38.825
I don't see any damage so far.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.331
What was that?

20:53.875 --> 20:56.867
Yeah, well, there's
nothing wrong with your laser.

20:56.875 --> 21:00.322
I told you
you couldn't get through.

21:00.333 --> 21:05.373
Well, then maybe
it's time for a smoke.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.867
Come on, pal,
how about a light?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.366
Is he really taking
the time for a smoke?

21:57.917 --> 22:00.408
Well, that's kinda pretty.

22:00.417 --> 22:05.957
Gant, remind me to get
another pair of binoculars.

22:08.417 --> 22:10.408
Geez, I hate to do this.

22:10.417 --> 22:12.954
You're the best pair I ever had.

22:12.959 --> 22:13.948
Binoculars?

22:13.959 --> 22:15.415
What the...?

22:15.417 --> 22:16.406
What're you doing
with binoculars?

22:33.959 --> 22:35.950
Well, I'll tell ya,

22:35.959 --> 22:40.453
did you ever see a scorpion
sting itself to death?

23:08.667 --> 23:10.123
I think I'm in.

23:10.125 --> 23:11.661
What does it
look like down there?

23:12.125 --> 23:13.114
Twilight Zone.

23:14.667 --> 23:17.659
Elevator's jammed
in the shaft,

23:17.667 --> 23:20.158
so I'm gonna have to find
another way to the lower level.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.656
I'm headin' for the bio lab.

23:41.166 --> 23:43.703
We got a problem, boys.

23:43.709 --> 23:44.698
What is it, Mac?

23:44.709 --> 23:47.701
Well, the corridor's
caved in ahead here.

23:47.709 --> 23:51.156
I don't think
I can make that bio lab.

23:52.709 --> 23:53.698
Back the other way, MacGyver.

23:53.709 --> 23:54.698
There's a control room.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.155
Hold it a second.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.698
Mac, what's happening?

24:14.208 --> 24:15.197
I'm getting a tapping sound

24:15.709 --> 24:17.199
coming from the direction
of the lab.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.207
I got a pretty big girder
in my way here, though.

24:30.208 --> 24:33.746
Come on back to me
one more time.

24:38.250 --> 24:40.741
I got some life down here, boys.

24:41.250 --> 24:42.740
Uh, MacGyver, the girder.

24:42.750 --> 24:43.739
Can you move it?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.741
Well, that'd take some doing.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.240
It's wedged in here pretty good.

24:47.750 --> 24:50.241
If I could raise it up
about three or four inches,

24:50.250 --> 24:52.741
I might be able
to swing it to one side.

24:54.250 --> 24:55.740
What's that sound?

24:55.750 --> 24:57.741
It was me, Mac,
just taking a sip of water.

24:57.750 --> 25:00.241
Water.

26:30.333 --> 26:31.869
MacGyver,

26:31.875 --> 26:32.864
what are you doing down there?

26:32.875 --> 26:35.867
Praying my back
doesn't give out.

26:42.875 --> 26:44.365
Is there anybody hurt seriously?

26:44.375 --> 26:45.364
Some of us,

26:45.875 --> 26:47.365
but we can all walk.

26:47.375 --> 26:49.366
All right, let's
get you out of here.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.366
One at a time,
up through that hole.

26:51.875 --> 26:55.367
You can make your way to
the corridor from there.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.912
Colson, you got a whole bunch
of people coming your way.

26:58.917 --> 27:01.909
A rope ladder in the elevator
shaft ought to get them topside.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.364
We'll see them
out from up here.

27:03.375 --> 27:04.364
Thank you.

27:04.917 --> 27:05.906
Yeah, we got lucky.

27:05.917 --> 27:06.906
Let's just hope it holds, huh?

27:07.375 --> 27:08.911
Sure you can go on, Mac?

27:08.917 --> 27:10.908
Well, unless you got another way
to get to Marlowe and Steubens,

27:10.917 --> 27:12.373
I'm just
getting lazy.

27:14.917 --> 27:15.906
Marlowe and Steub...

27:15.917 --> 27:18.408
you're not saying they're
still alive, are you?

27:18.417 --> 27:21.909
Yes, ma'am, in the lab
on the third level.

27:21.917 --> 27:23.407
I know where.

27:23.917 --> 27:26.408
I, I mean, I was just about
to join them again in his lab

27:26.417 --> 27:27.406
when the first explosion hit.

27:27.417 --> 27:28.907
Are you going
down after them?

27:28.917 --> 27:30.407
Yeah, well, that's the plan.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.408
It sure would be a big help
if you could tell me

27:32.417 --> 27:33.907
how you made it
all the way back up here.

27:34.417 --> 27:35.406
I'll do better than that.

27:35.417 --> 27:36.406
I'll show you.

27:36.417 --> 27:37.907
I'm going with you.

27:37.917 --> 27:38.952
No, whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no,

27:38.959 --> 27:40.950
I'm sorry, but the only place
you're going

27:40.959 --> 27:42.415
is up through that hole
to the surface.

27:42.417 --> 27:45.955
Oh, no,
not without Carl Steubens.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.954
Look, uh...

27:49.959 --> 27:50.948
Spencer.
Barbara Spencer.

27:50.959 --> 27:54.406
Barbara, what if I were
to tell you

27:54.417 --> 27:56.408
that, if I can't stop
an acid leak down there,

27:56.959 --> 27:59.450
in a few hours, they're going
to flood this whole complex

27:59.458 --> 28:00.948
with sodium hydroxide?

28:00.959 --> 28:03.450
Then I'd say we're wasting time.

28:05.458 --> 28:07.449
Uh, guys, we got a little
change of plan here.

28:07.458 --> 28:10.450
I have a Barbara Spencer
on my hands.

28:10.959 --> 28:12.449
She's coming with me.

28:15.458 --> 28:16.447
God, I hate heights.

28:41.001 --> 28:43.993
I know this is a stupid
time to ask, but...

28:44.001 --> 28:45.491
have you got a name?

28:45.500 --> 28:47.491
MacGyver.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.990
Heh, MacGyver.

28:49.500 --> 28:50.990
That's a good name.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.492
Any idea what set
the blasts off?

28:59.500 --> 29:00.990
No, it was so sudden,

29:01.000 --> 29:02.991
I barely had time to make
it past the electronics lab

29:03.000 --> 29:04.490
before that exploded, too.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.992
Huh. Steubens' lab,
bio lab, electronics.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.489
It seems like
all the explosions

29:09.500 --> 29:12.492
were somehow connected
to the labs.

29:12.500 --> 29:13.489
I don't see
how that's possible.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.490
They're all independent of
each other.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.489
Is this where you came up?

29:16.500 --> 29:18.536
Yes, there's a stairway...
Hey, hold it! Hold it!

29:40.542 --> 29:42.032
Oh!

29:45.041 --> 29:48.533
Is there another way down?

29:48.542 --> 29:49.531
The gas chamber.

29:49.542 --> 29:51.533
The what?

29:51.542 --> 29:53.032
It's a nickname
we have around here

29:53.041 --> 29:55.032
for a series of air locks
around a common lab

29:55.041 --> 29:56.531
that work with sensitive gases.

29:56.542 --> 29:58.578
This way.

30:00.041 --> 30:02.578
Uh, you got three hours
and 27 minutes, Mac.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.039
How's Spencer holding up?

30:04.041 --> 30:05.577
She likes my name.

30:06.041 --> 30:07.577
What more could I ask for?

30:10.041 --> 30:11.577
Chocolate.

30:12.041 --> 30:13.030
Want one of these?

30:13.041 --> 30:14.030
No, thanks.

30:17.041 --> 30:19.578
How can you thinkabout eating
candy at a time like this

30:19.583 --> 30:21.574
when chances of us
getting out of here alive...

30:21.583 --> 30:23.073
I know what the odds are.

30:23.083 --> 30:24.573
But I thought we might be able

30:24.583 --> 30:27.074
to store up on a little energy
before we pressed on.

30:27.583 --> 30:28.572
Let's go.

30:33.583 --> 30:36.575
Strange.

30:36.583 --> 30:38.073
What's that?

30:38.083 --> 30:39.619
Air locks along the corridor
are designed to close

30:40.083 --> 30:41.072
in any emergency.

30:42.625 --> 30:44.081
MacGyver!

30:44.083 --> 30:45.072
Hurry!

31:16.625 --> 31:18.115
Carl?

31:18.125 --> 31:19.661
Carl?

31:19.667 --> 31:22.124
We're still alive?

31:22.125 --> 31:24.662
After that explosion,
it's a miracle we are.

31:24.667 --> 31:27.124
But, uh, we're,
we're trapped down here,

31:27.125 --> 31:29.662
and the intercom, it's,
it's on-off, on-off.

31:30.125 --> 31:32.116
They, they know we're here?

31:32.125 --> 31:34.116
They're trying to get to us.

31:34.125 --> 31:36.116
With all the damage
on the upper levels,

31:36.125 --> 31:38.116
it's a, it's...

31:38.125 --> 31:39.160
Oh, no.

31:40.166 --> 31:41.656
Roger.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.157
Colonel...

31:43.166 --> 31:44.656
the hydroxide tankers
are reaching the complex now.

31:45.166 --> 31:46.656
Get Burke on the line.

31:46.667 --> 31:47.656
Tell him we'll be ready

31:47.667 --> 31:50.158
to flood the complex
in 55 minutes.

31:52.166 --> 31:54.157
Listen, we're repairing
the circuits

31:54.166 --> 31:56.657
that open the air lock doors
that are behind you.

31:57.166 --> 31:58.702
I hear you.

31:58.709 --> 32:00.700
Do you have any idea
what kind of gas is in there?

32:00.709 --> 32:03.701
No, I sure don't.

32:03.709 --> 32:05.700
Maybe Spencer does.

32:09.709 --> 32:13.156
Yeah, Colson, I don't think
we can get a fix on it just yet.

32:13.166 --> 32:15.157
We're going to try
the air lock circuits now.

32:15.709 --> 32:17.165
Okay.

32:33.208 --> 32:34.197
Colson?

32:34.208 --> 32:37.200
Yeah?

32:37.208 --> 32:38.197
Sorry.

32:41.208 --> 32:43.745
What's the distance from
here to that complex wall?

32:43.750 --> 32:45.206
Uh, 885 yards.

32:45.750 --> 32:46.739
Just over a half mile.

32:46.750 --> 32:48.206
And a straight shot.

32:48.208 --> 32:49.197
Radio Burke.

32:49.208 --> 32:50.744
Tell him we found a spot.

32:50.750 --> 32:53.742
Colson, this is
a gas lab, right?

32:53.750 --> 32:56.207
Wouldn't there be some vacuum
pumps to evacuate the air

32:56.208 --> 32:58.199
just in case of an emergency?

32:58.208 --> 33:00.244
Yeah, that's right, there are.

33:00.250 --> 33:03.242
But you would have to go through
the gas to get to them.

33:03.250 --> 33:05.741
And even then, there's no
guarantee that they'll work.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.239
Mac, you can't.

33:07.250 --> 33:08.740
Once you break the seal
on that air lock,

33:08.750 --> 33:10.240
the gas'll kill you.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.740
It doesn't matter, Gant.

33:11.750 --> 33:14.241
We're going to run out of air
in here pretty soon anyway.

33:14.250 --> 33:17.242
The switch for the pum
ps is on that panel. See it?

33:17.750 --> 33:19.786
All right.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.239
When we open this air lock,

33:23.250 --> 33:24.786
I want you to head
straight for that passage

33:25.250 --> 33:27.787
down to the next level,
all right?

33:27.792 --> 33:30.249
Here.

33:39.291 --> 33:42.283
I want you to put this around
your mouth and nose.

33:42.291 --> 33:46.284
It won't keep out the gas,
but it might help a little.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.782
MacGyver, if you don't
get the pumps started...

33:48.792 --> 33:50.282
Hey, hey...

33:50.291 --> 33:52.282
I just wanted to say..

33:57.291 --> 33:58.827
Thanks.

33:58.834 --> 34:00.825
You bet.

34:47.333 --> 34:50.324
It's the indicator lights
for the pumps.

34:50.333 --> 34:51.869
They're coming on.

34:54.333 --> 34:57.325
I can't be positive they're
working, but they're on.

34:59.875 --> 35:03.367
Mac, Mac, can you hear me?

35:03.375 --> 35:04.875
Colonel Keel's
confirmed, sir.

35:04.875 --> 35:07.366
They're about to go into the
launch procedure. Thank you.

35:07.375 --> 35:08.865
Launch procedure?
What launch procedure?

35:09.375 --> 35:10.364
What's he talking about,
Charlie?

35:10.375 --> 35:11.364
Ed, Ed, Ed, take it easy.

35:11.875 --> 35:12.364
We had no choice.

35:12.875 --> 35:13.864
About what?
About the acids.

35:13.875 --> 35:15.866
We can't be sure the
sodium hydroxide flooding

35:16.375 --> 35:17.364
is going to be enough.

35:17.375 --> 35:19.366
We have to fuse
the substratum rock

35:19.375 --> 35:20.911
between here
and the aquifer.

35:20.917 --> 35:22.908
And we think an
underground missile

35:23.375 --> 35:25.366
aimed at the KIVA
foundation might do it.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.366
A missile?

35:27.917 --> 35:29.373
And what happens
to the KIVA?

35:29.375 --> 35:31.366
Below the first leve
l there won't be a KIVA.

35:35.917 --> 35:37.908
Mac, you got
to get out of there.

35:37.917 --> 35:39.407
They've got a missile
aimed at you.

35:39.917 --> 35:40.906
Mac!

35:40.917 --> 35:42.407
Mac, can you hear me?

35:42.917 --> 35:44.407
Mac! Answer me!

35:44.917 --> 35:46.908
Mac, u-use your intercom.

35:46.917 --> 35:48.407
Mac!

35:50.417 --> 35:53.409
Bad news, Spencer.
We lost the two-way mike.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.408
They don't know
where we are now.

35:55.417 --> 35:57.908
Let's find that acid leak.

36:01.417 --> 36:03.954
The tanks should
be this way.

36:03.959 --> 36:05.415
Watch your step now.

36:05.417 --> 36:07.954
This is nasty stuff
we're lookin' for.

36:24.458 --> 36:25.447
MacGyver!

36:25.458 --> 36:27.949
Well, it looks like
the explosion cracked

36:27.959 --> 36:28.948
the foundation, too.

36:29.458 --> 36:30.948
Acid's runnin'
into the ground through that.

36:30.959 --> 36:32.449
Well, there's
nothing we can do

36:32.959 --> 36:33.948
to stop it, is there?

36:33.959 --> 36:36.951
We might be able
to whip up a Band-Aid.

36:36.959 --> 36:39.996
Our first problem, though,
is to get up to that crack.

36:40.001 --> 36:40.990
Do you think
you could balance

36:41.001 --> 36:42.992
against that tank if you
stood on my shoulders?

36:43.001 --> 36:46.994
That might get us close
enough to stop that leak.

36:47.001 --> 36:49.447
With what? That's sulfur
ic acid up there, remember?

36:49.458 --> 36:50.994
With these.

36:51.458 --> 36:53.449
Chocolate bars?

36:53.458 --> 36:54.994
To you, they're
milk chocolate.

36:55.001 --> 36:57.447
To sulfuric acid,
it's lactose and sucrose--

36:58.001 --> 37:01.493
C12, H22, O11--
disaccharides.

37:02.001 --> 37:03.491
The acid will react
with the sugars

37:03.500 --> 37:04.990
to form
an elemental carbon

37:05.001 --> 37:05.990
and a thick gummy residue.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.991
That should be enough
to clog up that rupture,

37:09.001 --> 37:10.491
temporarily at least.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.990
Comin' up!

37:21.000 --> 37:23.491
All right, I'm movin' over.

37:28.500 --> 37:31.992
All right, bars are
comin' up, right hand.

37:32.500 --> 37:37.494
A little closer.

37:37.500 --> 37:39.536
All right, start stuffin' 'em
in at the angle

37:40.000 --> 37:41.536
and work your way over.

37:41.542 --> 37:42.531
Oh, and, Spencer?

37:42.542 --> 37:44.533
Yeah, make sure it melts
in the acid

37:44.542 --> 37:45.531
and not in my hand, right?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.992
Yeah.

38:06.542 --> 38:09.033
How much longer
before they launch?

38:09.041 --> 38:10.531
From our last sync check,

38:10.542 --> 38:12.032
nine minutes
and 30 seconds.

38:18.041 --> 38:20.032
I think we got it!

38:20.041 --> 38:22.578
Yeah. Nice work, Spencer.

38:48.583 --> 38:49.572
Oh, no!

38:49.583 --> 38:51.574
There's the door to
Steubens' lab right there,

38:52.083 --> 38:53.072
but with all this
in the way,

38:53.583 --> 38:54.572
I don't know how
we're gonna get...

38:54.583 --> 38:55.572
Well, we're just
gonna have

38:56.083 --> 38:57.072
to build ourselves a new door.

38:57.083 --> 38:58.573
Is there any way to
communicate with them?

38:58.583 --> 39:00.619
There's a lab-to-lab
intercom.

39:00.625 --> 39:01.614
I'll try it.

39:05.083 --> 39:07.620
Dr. Steubens!
Dr. Marlowe!

39:08.083 --> 39:09.619
Can you hear me?
Please!

39:09.625 --> 39:12.082
Can you answer this?

39:12.083 --> 39:13.072
Are you all right?

39:13.083 --> 39:17.076
Dr. Marlowe!

39:17.083 --> 39:18.072
Plastique...

39:18.083 --> 39:20.620
Can you hear me?

39:21.125 --> 39:22.114
A bomb.

39:22.125 --> 39:23.615
Dr. Marlowe!

39:23.625 --> 39:24.614
Yes.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.614
Is Carl all right?

39:26.125 --> 39:27.615
Oh, yes, he's all right, but...

39:27.625 --> 39:29.616
We're down here on the third
level in metallurgy...

39:30.125 --> 39:31.615
just behind the back wall
of your lab.

39:31.625 --> 39:32.614
No!

39:33.125 --> 39:35.616
It's them, Carl,
they're right there!

39:35.625 --> 39:37.115
They've,
they've come to get us.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.662
We're gonna...

39:39.667 --> 39:41.658
Dr. Marlowe, I want you
to build yourselves a barricade

39:41.667 --> 39:43.658
as far from the back wall
as you possibly can.

39:43.667 --> 39:44.656
We're gonna try

39:44.667 --> 39:45.656
and blow an opening
in that wall.

39:45.667 --> 39:46.656
Do you understand?

39:46.667 --> 39:48.123
We'll do it.

39:48.125 --> 39:50.662
Blow an opening?

39:51.125 --> 39:52.661
With what?

39:52.667 --> 39:54.658
Don't tell me you know
how to make a bomb

39:54.667 --> 39:56.123
out of a stick of chewing gum.

39:56.125 --> 39:58.116
Why, you got some?

39:59.667 --> 40:00.656
Come on.
This is a lab, right?

40:00.667 --> 40:02.658
There's gotta be something here

40:02.667 --> 40:04.157
we can fake it with.

40:07.667 --> 40:09.157
What kind of lab
is this anyway?

40:09.166 --> 40:11.157
It's metallurgy.

40:11.166 --> 40:12.656
Metallurgy... metallurgy...
metallurgy.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.658
Come on, MacGyver.

40:15.166 --> 40:16.656
Sodium metal. That'll do it.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.703
Any idea where
they might keep it?

40:19.709 --> 40:20.698
In here.

40:27.709 --> 40:29.165
Bingo.

40:29.166 --> 40:32.158
All right, we probably
won't need much more

40:32.166 --> 40:33.155
than a few grams,

40:33.709 --> 40:35.165
but we're gonna have
to contain it in something.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.155
Test tube?

40:36.166 --> 40:37.155
No. Much too big,

40:37.166 --> 40:38.702
and it's got to be
water soluble,

40:38.709 --> 40:41.200
something cellulose.

40:41.208 --> 40:45.201
How about a cold capsule?

40:45.208 --> 40:46.197
Yeah.

40:46.709 --> 40:47.698
You know, Spencer,

40:47.709 --> 40:51.201
I think you're startin' to
get the hang of this.

40:51.208 --> 40:52.197
But I do wish I had known

40:52.208 --> 40:54.199
you had a cold
before I kissed you.

40:54.208 --> 40:57.700
Attention!
Six minutes to missile launch.

40:57.709 --> 41:00.746
I say again, six minutes
to missile launch.

41:02.208 --> 41:04.745
All right, now try
to find me a glass jar,

41:04.750 --> 41:06.741
about a quart size
with a stopper in it.

41:06.750 --> 41:08.206
Put some water in it,
all right?

41:08.208 --> 41:09.744
Okay.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.787
This capsule hits
the water and dissolves,

41:56.792 --> 41:58.248
the sodium'll
give off hydrogen,

41:58.792 --> 42:03.286
and there'll enough of a
reaction to ignite it.

42:03.792 --> 42:05.282
Call Marlowe and tell
him to get down.

42:05.291 --> 42:06.781
We're ready.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.282
Dr. Marlowe, we're gonna try

42:10.792 --> 42:12.783
and blow an opening
in the wall now.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.282
All right, Spencer,
do me a favor, will ya?

42:25.291 --> 42:26.827
Name it.

42:26.834 --> 42:28.825
Let me go in after
Marlowe and Steubens.

42:28.834 --> 42:29.823
You wait out here, all right?

42:30.291 --> 42:31.280
Why?

42:31.291 --> 42:35.284
Well, chalk it up to
superstition, all right?

42:40.333 --> 42:41.823
Wait here!

42:46.834 --> 42:50.827
Marlowe! Steubens!
You all right?

42:50.834 --> 42:53.325
Yeah. We're,
we're over here.

42:54.333 --> 42:55.322
Oh...

42:55.834 --> 42:56.823
Get on the intercom.

42:57.333 --> 42:58.823
Try to reach the surface.

42:58.834 --> 42:59.869
Okay.

43:01.333 --> 43:03.324
You, back!

43:03.333 --> 43:04.869
Sidney,

43:04.875 --> 43:07.332
get away from that intercom.

43:09.333 --> 43:10.869
Carl, what is this?
What are you doing?

43:10.875 --> 43:12.866
Have you gone clean out
of your mind?

43:12.875 --> 43:13.864
MacGyver, is everyone
all right?

43:13.875 --> 43:14.864
Spencer, gosh darn it!

43:14.875 --> 43:15.864
I told you
to wait outside.

43:15.875 --> 43:17.866
I'm sorry, Barbara.

43:17.875 --> 43:20.366
Carl, I don't understand.

43:20.375 --> 43:23.867
The explosion down here...
itwasn't an accident.

43:25.375 --> 43:27.866
Everybody kept lookin'
for an accidental explanation

43:27.875 --> 43:29.365
because nothing else
made sense.

43:29.375 --> 43:30.865
With all the secur
ity of this place,

43:30.875 --> 43:31.864
who could possib
ly get a bomb

43:31.875 --> 43:33.365
to this level?

43:33.375 --> 43:34.364
You and Marlowe,

43:34.375 --> 43:36.366
you weren't supposed
to survive.

43:36.375 --> 43:37.364
No.

43:37.875 --> 43:39.365
Carl, this makes no sense!

43:39.917 --> 43:40.906
Doesn't it?

43:40.917 --> 43:41.906
You told me Sendrex ordered

43:42.375 --> 43:43.911
a whole new series
of experiments,

43:43.917 --> 43:46.374
but that Steubens refused
to accept the results.

43:46.375 --> 43:47.911
So, he invites the only other

43:47.917 --> 43:49.373
expert in the field to visit.

43:49.375 --> 43:51.366
One accidental explosion

43:51.375 --> 43:54.913
and all this research
is set back 20 years.

43:54.917 --> 43:56.908
Maybe more.

43:57.375 --> 43:58.364
They wanted it
to become a weapon.

43:58.375 --> 44:01.913
I've spent my whole life
to stop suffering.

44:01.917 --> 44:04.408
A weapon?

44:04.417 --> 44:06.908
Chain reactions in the ozone...

44:06.917 --> 44:08.407
Without the ozone layer,

44:08.417 --> 44:10.908
the sun's ultraviolet rays
would kill everything on Earth.

44:10.917 --> 44:12.908
I think Carl here discovered

44:12.917 --> 44:17.411
the key to make the ozone layer
self-destruct, didn't you, Carl?

44:17.417 --> 44:21.410
The ultimate doomsday weapon.

44:21.417 --> 44:23.408
I couldn't give them that.

44:23.417 --> 44:25.408
I still can't.

44:25.417 --> 44:26.953
Sidney,

44:26.959 --> 44:28.950
we're the only ones
who can stop this.

44:28.959 --> 44:29.948
No!

44:35.959 --> 44:37.415
That was dumb, Spencer!

44:37.417 --> 44:39.453
Very, very dumb!

44:39.458 --> 44:41.949
Yeah, it also hurts
like hell!

44:41.959 --> 44:44.951
Ah, stop talkin', will ya?

44:44.959 --> 44:47.450
Colson, I want you
to begin the flooding.

44:48.458 --> 44:49.948
All right, Spencer,

44:49.959 --> 44:52.450
it's time to get you
out of here.

44:52.458 --> 44:54.449
You're a lousy liar,
MacGyver.

44:54.959 --> 44:57.450
We're out of time
and they don't even know

44:57.458 --> 44:58.948
we're down here, do they?

44:58.959 --> 45:01.996
There's gotta be some way
to contact the surface.

45:02.001 --> 45:04.447
You did everything
in your power, Mac.

45:05.001 --> 45:07.447
Spencer, you're a genius!

45:40.500 --> 45:42.491
What's going on with
the lights, Colson?

45:42.500 --> 45:43.489
I don't know.

45:44.000 --> 45:44.989
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

45:45.000 --> 45:45.989
Morse code, sir.

45:46.000 --> 45:46.989
What's it saying?

45:50.500 --> 45:53.492
20, 18, 18,

45:53.500 --> 45:55.491
1 7, 16...

45:56.000 --> 45:58.491
''Acid stopped...

45:59.000 --> 45:59.989
All safe. Mac.''

46:01.542 --> 46:03.533
The missile!
Abort the launch!

46:03.542 --> 46:05.533
Abort launch? Yes, sir.

46:05.542 --> 46:07.533
Abort launch!
Abort launch!

46:07.542 --> 46:08.998
Repeat, abort launch!

46:14.542 --> 46:16.999
Hey, hold it a second, guys.

46:17.542 --> 46:18.531
What is this, Spence,
you trying

46:18.542 --> 46:20.032
to get outta here
without saying good-bye?

46:20.041 --> 46:26.037
I'd kiss you, MacGyver,
but I got this cold.

46:26.041 --> 46:28.032
So, what's a little cold
between friends, huh?

46:40.583 --> 46:42.574
You're terrific, Spencer.

46:48.041 --> 46:49.577
Move her out.

46:55.583 --> 46:57.574
You still haven't told me
what you do for a living.

46:57.583 --> 46:58.572
Oh, I'm sort of

46:58.583 --> 46:59.572
a repairman.

46:59.583 --> 47:02.575
But I like playing basketball
with you best.

47:02.583 --> 47:04.073
Okay, what's the deal this time?

47:04.083 --> 47:05.072
Championship.

47:05.083 --> 47:07.074
Seventh and final game of this

47:07.583 --> 47:09.073
awesomely contested match.

47:09.083 --> 47:11.574
110-108-- my team
on top, of course.

47:11.583 --> 47:13.073
And the clock?

47:13.083 --> 47:14.573
A paltry three seconds remain.

47:14.583 --> 47:15.572
Ow! Look at that!

47:15.583 --> 47:17.073
Short Stuff's out.

47:17.083 --> 47:18.072
All right, wait.
Hold it.

47:18.083 --> 47:19.072
Hold the phone.

47:19.083 --> 47:20.072
What?

47:20.083 --> 47:21.619
You better get somebody
ready to measure me

47:21.625 --> 47:22.614
for my championship ring.

47:23.083 --> 47:24.625
All right, shoot it!
Shoot it!

47:24.625 --> 47:27.082
All right.
Reggie stops, pops,

47:27.083 --> 47:29.620
and is tops!

47:29.625 --> 47:32.617
A phenomenal shot
by a short kid!

47:32.625 --> 47:35.617
The fans go crazy!

47:36.305 --> 47:42.915
