01:46.083 --> 01:48.791
<i>- My dear,</i>
<i>are you sure this is wise?</i>

01:48.875 --> 01:50.458
<i>I'm quite sure it is not.</i>

01:50.541 --> 01:52.833
<i>Mr. Raikes feels it's</i>
<i>our only way out of a logjam.</i>

01:52.916 --> 01:55.666
- And I agree.
- So what is his plan?

01:55.750 --> 01:58.458
- We're meeting in the park
later to finalize details,

01:58.541 --> 02:00.541
but I know it's next Friday.

02:02.708 --> 02:04.166
It's a lot to ask.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.833
Go on.

02:06.916 --> 02:08.750
Can we meet here on the day?

02:08.833 --> 02:10.541
I'll get my bag to you somehow.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.583
- And I'll provide the carriage
to take you to Grand Central.

02:13.666 --> 02:15.041
Would you do that?

02:15.125 --> 02:17.375
- Why not?
I have no fear of scandal.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.875
I'm a walking scandal as it is.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.791
- And when we're married,
we'll come back to New York

02:21.875 --> 02:23.166
and see how the land lies.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.708
After all, there's no law
that says we have to stay here.

02:25.791 --> 02:27.208
I do not believe

02:27.291 --> 02:29.875
Mr. Raikes will give up
New York so easily.

02:29.958 --> 02:31.125
You're wrong.

02:31.208 --> 02:35.166
Society means as little to him
as it does to me.

02:35.250 --> 02:37.583
Then that is what matters.

02:39.416 --> 02:41.000
Thank you, Edward.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.416
- Does the podium look
big enough to you?

02:44.500 --> 02:46.333
- It's what
the band leader asked for.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.833
Good, good.

02:48.916 --> 02:50.625
And everything's
on course downstairs?

02:50.708 --> 02:53.041
- It's all under control,
ma'am.

02:53.125 --> 02:55.416
- I'm worried
that it may be too small.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.166
- Take a tray of coffee
to the drawing room

03:07.250 --> 03:09.708
- for Mrs. Russell right away.
- Right away, sir.

03:09.791 --> 03:11.916
- Have they finished upstairs?
- They're finishing now.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.416
- Is the mistress pleased?
- Is she ever pleased?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.208
- Content, then?
- She's very nervous.

03:16.291 --> 03:19.000
- She has nothing
to worry about.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.875
- Good, the carriage is here.
- Yes, ma'am.

03:23.958 --> 03:25.416
I want to arrive before 3:00.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.000
I believe Mrs. Astor is very
precise about these things.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.791
- It's a quarter past 2:00,
ma'am.

03:29.875 --> 03:32.291
So I'd say
your timing is perfect.

03:32.375 --> 03:34.083
Hup, hup.

03:45.083 --> 03:48.125
<i>- Mrs. Chamberlain will let us</i>
<i>meet at her house at 10:00.</i>

03:48.208 --> 03:49.916
Her carriage will take us
to Grand Central.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I'll get a bag to her,

03:51.083 --> 03:53.750
and you can carry
what you need for the night...

03:53.833 --> 03:55.041
but not too much.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.083
We won't be gone long.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.833
I love you, Marian.

04:00.916 --> 04:02.583
In fact, I don't think
I've ever loved you more

04:02.666 --> 04:04.750
than I do at this moment.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.416
That's all right, then.

04:21.041 --> 04:23.000
- Mrs. Astor is not
at home, madam.

04:23.083 --> 04:27.833
- You gave her my card?
- I'm afraid she's not at home.

04:27.916 --> 04:29.833
- You didn't tell her
about that time in Newport,

04:29.916 --> 04:31.500
did you, Mr. Hefty?

04:31.583 --> 04:34.291
Mrs. Astor is not at home.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.791
- So you said.
- Good day.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.666
- Wait for me.
- Of course, ma'am.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.000
I shouldn't be long.

04:40.083 --> 04:43.000
- Welcome, Mrs. Randolph.
- Good day, Hefty.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.250
- Come right this way.
- Thank you.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.000
- Hyah.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.708
<i>- How's the ball</i>
<i>coming along, Mother?</i>

04:56.791 --> 04:58.541
- That reminds me--

04:58.625 --> 05:01.250
I'm afraid we must ask
Carrie Astor to step down.

05:01.333 --> 05:02.375
What?

05:02.458 --> 05:04.458
- It won't be possible
for her to perform the dance.

05:04.541 --> 05:05.500
Why not?

05:05.583 --> 05:06.708
Because it won't be possible

05:06.791 --> 05:08.125
for me to invite her
to the ball.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.416
What are you saying?

05:09.500 --> 05:10.708
- I looked in
on Mrs. Astor today,

05:10.791 --> 05:12.250
and she wouldn't accept
my call.

05:12.333 --> 05:13.250
I told you.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.083
- But I can't have
her daughter here

05:15.166 --> 05:17.041
- when she doesn't receive me.
- Perhaps she wasn't there.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.666
- A friend of hers was admitted
just as I was leaving.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.375
- They've been practicing
for weeks.

05:21.458 --> 05:22.541
Why didn't you say this sooner?

05:22.625 --> 05:24.833
- It never occurred to me
Mrs. Astor would let Carrie

05:24.916 --> 05:27.000
dance at the ball if she didn't
plan to come herself.

05:27.083 --> 05:29.166
- But, Mother,
Orme Wilson's Carrie's partner.

05:29.250 --> 05:30.333
It's all arranged.

05:30.416 --> 05:31.833
I can't help that.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.166
What about the others?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.375
- Angela Schermerhorn,
Sally Drexel, the boys?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.458
Are they all to be turned away
if their parents won't come?

05:37.541 --> 05:38.625
I'm afraid so.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.458
- Mother, you can't pull
the rug from under them now.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.958
- You will not say "can't"
to me.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.208
- Why shouldn't the girl come
on her own if she wants to?

05:44.291 --> 05:45.916
And the rest
of the young people, too?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.791
- And do you think
Mrs. Astor would entertain

05:47.875 --> 05:49.791
a young woman
whose mother had snubbed her?

05:52.958 --> 05:54.625
Precisely.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.791
Thank you, Church.

06:07.791 --> 06:09.708
- Oh.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.291
What a nice surprise.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.041
I hope this means
you've changed your mind.

06:13.125 --> 06:16.083
- No, but it's good to see you.
I'm here to collect my clothes.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.208
- Aunt Agnes
will be so disappointed.

06:18.291 --> 06:20.708
- Please give them both
my best regards.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.375
Have you made your plans?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.416
- We're meeting
at Mrs. Chamberlain's.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.125
How kind of her.

06:29.208 --> 06:30.833
Oh, that's nice.

06:30.916 --> 06:33.125
- I don't suppose
you'd do me a favor?

06:33.208 --> 06:35.416
I've got to smuggle
my traveling bag to her house,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.708
and nobody'd notice
if you had it.

06:37.791 --> 06:39.916
- It's not going to be heavy.
- I'll take it there.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.583
I'll be in a cab.

06:41.666 --> 06:43.416
Where are you planning to live?

06:43.500 --> 06:45.875
- In Tom's apartment,
I suppose.

06:45.958 --> 06:49.333
Unless he's got a better idea.
How are your parents?

06:49.416 --> 06:51.500
- My father's in Chicago
until next month.

06:51.583 --> 06:52.916
But my mother's well.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.541
- It's good that you can
spend time together

06:54.625 --> 06:55.916
before he gets back.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.625
- When is the wedding?
- Friday--

06:58.708 --> 07:00.458
same day
as Mrs. Russell's ball.

07:00.541 --> 07:02.833
Would you come and see me off?
We're leaving at 10:00.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.875
If you like.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.833
But I do feel sorry for
Mrs. Van Rhijn and Miss Brook.

07:07.916 --> 07:09.833
- Don't worry. I'm going
to write to Aunt Agnes

07:09.916 --> 07:11.375
with the whole story.

07:11.458 --> 07:12.875
I'll do a letter
for Aunt Ada, too,

07:12.958 --> 07:14.750
so it won't look suspicious.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.500
It's really happening, then?

07:17.583 --> 07:20.500
- Yes.

07:20.583 --> 07:22.291
It really is.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.625
- Ah, Caroline.
There's a letter for you.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.166
Hefty gave it to me.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.416
- Who was it from?
- Mrs. Russell.

07:31.500 --> 07:32.958
Oh.

07:33.041 --> 07:35.583
I suppose it was the invitation
to her wretched ball.

07:35.666 --> 07:36.958
No.

07:37.041 --> 07:40.166
It was explain why I would not
be sent an invitation.

07:40.250 --> 07:41.250
What?

07:41.333 --> 07:43.208
- She says I can't come
and I can't dance

07:43.291 --> 07:44.958
because you would not receive
her when she called.

07:45.041 --> 07:47.250
- She came
at an inconvenient moment.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.875
- She says someone else
was admitted.

07:48.958 --> 07:51.875
- That was Mrs. Randolph.
She wanted to see me alone.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.166
What was I to do?

07:53.250 --> 07:54.833
- Would you call
on Mrs. Russell now

07:54.916 --> 07:56.000
if I asked you?

07:56.083 --> 07:58.333
- I'm sure she's far too busy
to waste her time on me.

07:58.416 --> 07:59.916
But that's not true, is it?

08:00.000 --> 08:01.208
I'm sorry?

08:01.291 --> 08:03.375
- You wouldn't call on her
if your life depended on it.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.625
I worked on the dance
for weeks.

08:05.708 --> 08:07.541
Did you think of that?

08:07.625 --> 08:09.000
You must have known
she'd drop me

08:09.083 --> 08:10.458
when you wouldn't let her
into the house.

08:10.541 --> 08:12.041
- My dear.
- I'm going upstairs.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.458
Carrie.

08:13.541 --> 08:15.041
Caroline!

08:22.791 --> 08:24.625
Oh.

08:24.708 --> 08:27.666
I suppose this means
you're really leaving.

08:27.750 --> 08:29.875
I am, Miss Brook.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.083
I'm very sorry.

08:32.166 --> 08:34.958
- You've been so kind.
- Not at all.

08:35.041 --> 08:37.416
Oh, do use the front door.

08:37.500 --> 08:39.541
There's no need for you
to struggle down to the kitchen

08:39.625 --> 08:42.625
- and up the basement steps.
- Thank you.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.708
- Miss Marian has
a bag like that.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.208
This is Miss Marian's.

08:50.291 --> 08:52.500
She lent it to me for the move.

08:52.583 --> 08:57.333
- You'd never help Miss Marian
do anything foolish, would you?

08:57.416 --> 08:59.833
- I'd try to persuade her
not to do it.

08:59.916 --> 09:01.541
You can count on me for that.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.875
- That's not quite
the same thing, though, is it?

09:05.833 --> 09:07.416
Goodbye, my dear.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.000
Goodbye, Miss Brook.

09:15.250 --> 09:19.291
- Kneynsberg and Cuyper
want to extend their loan.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.708
By how much?

09:20.791 --> 09:21.958
They want another million

09:22.041 --> 09:24.750
and a year longer to repay--
same terms.

09:24.833 --> 09:26.750
- There's nothing wrong
with the bank, is there?

09:26.833 --> 09:29.208
- Not that I'm aware of,
but we'll look into it,

09:31.250 --> 09:33.458
- It's flattering
that the great Julius Cuyper

09:33.541 --> 09:35.000
should come
with his begging bowl.

09:35.083 --> 09:38.083
- Is he so very great?
- His wife is.

09:38.166 --> 09:40.583
They say even Mrs. Astor
treats her with care.

09:40.666 --> 09:43.500
- I don't know
about such things.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.625
- If you lived
with Mrs. Russell, you would.

09:51.583 --> 09:55.041
- If that's dinner, I'm afraid
Miss Caroline isn't here yet.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.875
- Oh, she's not coming down,
madam.

09:56.958 --> 09:59.291
She's asked for a tray
in her room.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.666
I see.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.333
- Would you like me
to go up there?

10:04.416 --> 10:05.500
No.

10:05.583 --> 10:08.041
If she's asked for a tray,

10:08.125 --> 10:10.666
then a tray she must have.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.458
Is she coming with me to
Mrs. Bevan's reception later,

10:13.541 --> 10:14.625
do you know?

10:14.708 --> 10:17.750
- According to her maid,
she's gone to bed, madam.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.958
Oh.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.000
Well, then...

10:22.083 --> 10:24.583
I shall go alone.

10:43.958 --> 10:46.541
Is anything the matter?

10:46.625 --> 10:47.833
You tell me.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.833
What do you mean?

10:50.916 --> 10:54.166
- You seem so distracted
nowadays.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.166
Is it Miss Barton's Red Cross?

10:59.083 --> 11:00.916
Well, something
is on your mind.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.375
Or are you going to tell me
I'm wrong?

11:04.458 --> 11:08.500
I hope it has nothing to do
with Mr. Raikes.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.583
- I know
Aunt Agnes doesn't like him.

11:10.666 --> 11:11.750
She will like him even less

11:11.833 --> 11:13.333
if you're planning
some sort of escapade.

11:13.416 --> 11:14.458
She'll come to like him

11:14.541 --> 11:15.916
when she decides
to get to know him.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.625
Not if you force her hand.

11:19.791 --> 11:22.375
- Dearest Aunt Ada, I don't
want you to know the details

11:22.458 --> 11:24.583
because I don't want you
to be blamed.

11:28.666 --> 11:31.041
Marian.

11:31.125 --> 11:33.666
If you want to marry this man,

11:33.750 --> 11:35.708
then come out with it.

11:35.791 --> 11:38.000
Sit through the argument.
Hold to your faith.

11:38.083 --> 11:39.875
And if he's right for you,

11:39.958 --> 11:42.916
eventually
it will come to pass.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.708
- I haven't got time
for eventually.

11:45.791 --> 11:48.416
- You will break Agnes's heart.
- You know that's not true.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.791
It's her pride we're dealing
with here, not her heart.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.958
- I can't help blaming
Mr. Raikes.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.958
Don't.

11:58.041 --> 12:01.083
We both wanted to wait until
we had Aunt Agnes's blessing.

12:01.166 --> 12:04.000
- But he hasn't waited,
has he, dear?

12:05.541 --> 12:08.791
- Oscar has invited himself
for dinner tomorrow night.

12:08.875 --> 12:10.791
That's nice.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.708
- Isn't Henry James a little
dense for a young lady?

12:24.791 --> 12:27.583
- Baudin,
that was a good dinner.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.833
What is it?

12:32.916 --> 12:36.666
- Is everything all right?
- Not exactly, sir.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.000
- I hope this doesn't mean
you're handing in your notice.

12:39.083 --> 12:42.541
- No. But it may result
in my dismissal.

12:45.333 --> 12:48.458
- That sounds very serious.
You'd better close the doors.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.500
- What?
- It's true.

12:54.583 --> 12:56.375
He's just a farm boy
from Kansas.

12:56.458 --> 12:59.625
- Then how did it all start?
- He was a merchant seaman.

12:59.708 --> 13:02.458
He left the ship in France,
found a job washing dishes

13:02.541 --> 13:03.625
at a restaurant in Cannes.

13:03.708 --> 13:05.125
He trained there.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.833
But when he got back
to New York,

13:06.916 --> 13:10.291
he discovered that nobody
wanted a cook from Wichita.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.625
They were all looking
for a chef from gay Paris.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.541
- And so he became
Monsieur Baudin?

13:14.625 --> 13:16.583
- He was quite settled
into the role when we met him.

13:16.666 --> 13:19.000
- What's his real name?
- Borden.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.208
Josh Borden.

13:21.291 --> 13:23.041
- And why
are we being told now?

13:23.125 --> 13:25.875
- His wife has tracked him down.
- And she wants money?

13:25.958 --> 13:27.666
- Worse.
She wanted a reconciliation.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.250
She'd found out
he was doing well.

13:29.333 --> 13:31.083
No doubt we will be hearing
from her soon.

13:31.166 --> 13:32.291
Well, I'm sorry, George,

13:32.375 --> 13:34.208
but we cannot have a chef
from Kansas.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.791
- We'd be a laughingstock.
- But if the food's the same...

13:36.875 --> 13:38.500
- You don't know
the women of New York.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.500
They're all looking for
something about us to ridicule.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.875
And when they hear
that we were taken in,

13:41.958 --> 13:44.375
we'd be providing it
on a plate, literally.

13:46.916 --> 13:49.000
- If that's your decision...
- It is.

13:49.083 --> 13:50.833
And I want him gone
for the ball.

13:50.916 --> 13:52.583
I'll send a message
to the agency in the morning

13:52.666 --> 13:54.541
for the best available chef
on their books.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.708
I'll give Baudin
excellent references,

13:56.791 --> 13:57.875
so you needn't look stricken.

13:57.958 --> 13:59.916
- It's unfair.
He's a hard worker.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.458
- He's been living
a lie, George,

14:01.541 --> 14:03.791
and it's made us vulnerable
to every snob in New York.

14:03.875 --> 14:05.416
We must do it.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.291
- So you brought it
on your own head?

14:10.375 --> 14:12.416
- I couldn't let it
go on forever.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.500
- But we're only a few days
away from Mrs. Russell's ball.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.583
- My wife thought
that strengthened her hand.

14:17.666 --> 14:18.750
I had to stop her.

14:18.833 --> 14:20.708
- If you're not
Monsieur Baudin,

14:20.791 --> 14:23.083
why are you still talking
like him?

14:23.166 --> 14:26.208
- Because this is
who I have been for years.

14:26.291 --> 14:29.125
And now it's hard
to break the habit.

14:29.208 --> 14:32.083
- If your name is Josh Borden
and you come from Wichita,

14:32.166 --> 14:33.708
I think you've got to try.

14:38.750 --> 14:41.333
You're right.

14:41.416 --> 14:45.000
You're absolutely right.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.458
So what happens now?

14:46.541 --> 14:49.125
- I cook
till the new chef arrives,

14:49.208 --> 14:50.958
and then he takes over.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.750
- What will you do
about your wife?

14:52.833 --> 14:55.291
- I shall try to persuade her
to divorce me.

14:55.375 --> 14:57.625
- Why didn't you do it
years ago when you had nothing?

14:57.708 --> 14:59.000
Because I'm a fool.

14:59.083 --> 15:00.750
- I think it's unfair
that you have to go,

15:00.833 --> 15:02.125
especially with the ball.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.583
- Please, don't take sides over
things you don't understand.

15:04.666 --> 15:06.583
Madam has a high mountain
to climb.

15:06.666 --> 15:09.250
She cannot
afford to be sentimental--

15:14.708 --> 15:15.750
She won't budge.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.166
I've tried everything
I can think of, I promise.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.166
- Carrie.
- Hello, Mrs. Russell.

15:20.250 --> 15:21.833
Church said you were here.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.166
- If you'd rather
I didn't call...

15:23.250 --> 15:25.458
- Oh, my dear,
I hope you understand

15:25.541 --> 15:27.541
why I cannot allow you
to perform at the ball.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.666
It is only because--

15:28.750 --> 15:30.000
- My mother has offended you,
I know.

15:30.083 --> 15:33.541
- But you are welcome in
this house at any other time.

15:33.625 --> 15:36.500
- Would you forgive my mother
if she apologized?

15:36.583 --> 15:37.541
I don't think it very likely,

15:37.625 --> 15:39.583
but of course,
I'd be delighted.

15:39.666 --> 15:41.000
- Your kindness
is a beacon of light

15:41.083 --> 15:42.625
after the treatment
you received.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.333
Thank you, my dear.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.916
And now I must go.
I have a fitting.

15:53.791 --> 15:55.958
Monsieur Charron, welcome.

15:56.041 --> 15:59.416
May I present our household,
whom you will come to know?

16:01.958 --> 16:03.416
If you wish.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.416
- Monsieur Charron,
I am Mrs. Bruce,

16:05.500 --> 16:06.916
the housekeeper here.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.416
And I have a book
of instructions

16:08.500 --> 16:10.583
which our last chef,
Mr. Borden, left

16:10.666 --> 16:12.208
to help you with the ball
tomorrow night.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.458
- Why would I both with that
when he has been sacked?

16:14.541 --> 16:17.625
- Mr. Borden was not sacked.
He left by mutual agreement.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.875
And because the ball is
almost upon us,

16:19.958 --> 16:22.333
he has done a great deal
of preliminary work already.

16:22.416 --> 16:25.208
- All of which he has recorded
in this notebook.

16:29.375 --> 16:31.583
- You had better read it,
monsieur.

16:31.666 --> 16:33.541
The mistress has agreed
to the menus,

16:33.625 --> 16:36.375
and she will not care
for any last-minute deviations.

16:36.458 --> 16:37.833
If the ball is tomorrow,

16:37.916 --> 16:40.791
I presume she must take
what I give her.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.250
Now, where is my room?

16:43.333 --> 16:44.875
If you would come with me...

16:47.208 --> 16:49.875
- If it's him
versus Mrs. Russell,

16:49.958 --> 16:51.083
what are the odds?

16:51.166 --> 16:52.875
- I know where I'd put
my money.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.791
- I'll correct it
right away, madam.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.500
- I thought I heard talking
in here.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.250
- The ball dress arrived
from Paris yesterday.

17:01.333 --> 17:03.583
Miss Gossage has been making
the final adjustments.

17:03.666 --> 17:05.875
I can't wait to see it.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.541
How is the ball going?

17:07.625 --> 17:09.250
- Acceptances from people
I don't want

17:09.333 --> 17:12.541
and a lot of Aurora's friends,
whom I want a little,

17:12.625 --> 17:15.583
silence from the people
I want a lot.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.208
- And the parents
of the dancers?

17:17.291 --> 17:19.250
- Not a squeak
from any of them.

17:19.333 --> 17:21.041
What about Mr. McAllister?

17:21.125 --> 17:22.541
- He won't decide
till he hears

17:22.625 --> 17:24.291
which way
his mystic rose will jump.

17:24.375 --> 17:27.250
- Surely she won't come now
you've uninvited her daughter.

17:27.333 --> 17:29.458
It's too late anyway.
The ball is tomorrow.

17:29.541 --> 17:30.958
We'll see.

17:31.041 --> 17:32.875
- In the morning,
I'll leave after breakfast,

17:32.958 --> 17:34.458
and I may have luncheon
with Aurora,

17:34.541 --> 17:37.000
so don't panic if I'm not home
by the evening.

17:37.083 --> 17:39.125
- Where are you going?
- Just paying a few calls.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.791
- And who expects a call
right after breakfast?

17:41.875 --> 17:44.375
- Marian always has such
a full dance card.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.458
Remember how worried we were

17:46.541 --> 17:48.291
about whether she would find
enough to do

17:48.375 --> 17:50.666
when she came to the city?

17:50.750 --> 17:53.166
How silly that seems now.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.625
- Ada tells me
Miss Scott has been here.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.083
She came for her things.

17:57.166 --> 17:59.250
- I assume
she's not coming back.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.708
I don't think so, no,

18:00.791 --> 18:02.750
but she sends you both
every good wish.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.583
That's something, I suppose.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.833
- You're sorry
she's gone, Mama.

18:06.916 --> 18:08.500
Why don't you admit it?

18:08.583 --> 18:10.500
- My secretary has handed in
her notice.

18:10.583 --> 18:11.750
What more is there to say?

18:11.833 --> 18:14.333
That you're sad about it.

18:14.416 --> 18:16.208
Very well.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.958
I'm sad.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.000
She was a great help to me.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.291
Now are you satisfied?

18:26.375 --> 18:28.625
Carrie? Caroline?

18:31.708 --> 18:33.041
May I come in?

18:33.125 --> 18:35.708
- Why do you bother to ask if
you're going to push in anyway?

18:37.541 --> 18:39.333
How long
will you keep this up?

18:39.416 --> 18:41.541
- Could ask you
the same question.

18:43.041 --> 18:45.625
- Suppose I were to call
on Mrs. Russell

18:45.708 --> 18:50.000
and explain that
I'm engaged tomorrow night.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.791
Are you?

18:51.875 --> 18:53.416
I can be, if necessary.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.041
She won't accept it.

18:56.125 --> 18:58.541
The trouble is, you assume
she's weaker than you.

18:58.625 --> 19:02.416
- She is weaker
than I am in this instance.

19:03.958 --> 19:05.625
We'll see.

20:02.458 --> 20:06.041
Well, we've reached the day.

20:06.125 --> 20:08.291
If there are still no answers
from the great folk,

20:08.375 --> 20:10.166
you'd better think of some
last-minute replacements

20:10.250 --> 20:11.458
if we're not to look absurd

20:11.541 --> 20:12.666
waltzing around
an empty ballroom.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.541
- Don't worry.
Aurora's been busy.

20:14.625 --> 20:15.875
The ballroom won't be empty.

20:15.958 --> 20:17.291
- But we'll be
without the great princes

20:17.375 --> 20:20.458
- you were tilting at.
- Don't speak too soon.

20:20.541 --> 20:23.541
- I wish I knew the cards you
think you have up your sleeve.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.208
- I'm taking a chance, George,
I know that.

20:26.291 --> 20:29.291
But who ever achieved great
things without taking a chance?

20:29.375 --> 20:30.833
True enough.

20:33.541 --> 20:35.041
See you tonight.

20:40.708 --> 20:42.416
Are you off, dear?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.083
Yes.

20:45.375 --> 20:46.791
- Would you like me
to post those?

20:46.875 --> 20:48.250
No.

20:48.333 --> 20:49.833
They're just something
for Larry Russell.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.833
I'll drop them off.

20:51.916 --> 20:54.000
Won't you need your bag?

21:03.250 --> 21:05.666
It's at Mrs. Chamberlain's.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.000
Of course.

21:08.083 --> 21:10.333
I saw Miss Scott go off
with it.

21:14.208 --> 21:17.125
You know that to accept help
from Mrs. Chamberlain with this

21:17.208 --> 21:20.291
is something that Agnes,
or anyone,

21:20.375 --> 21:22.291
would find very hard
to forgive.

21:22.375 --> 21:24.125
I must take my chances.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.333
Oh, my darling girl.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.041
Goodbye...

21:39.166 --> 21:40.500
And good luck.

21:40.583 --> 21:41.541
I'll write to you.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.708
Everything will be aboveboard,
I swear.

21:43.791 --> 21:47.041
- Miss Ada, Mrs. Van Rhijn's
asking for you.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.750
I'll come right up.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.375
- Would you like a cab,
Miss Marian?

21:52.458 --> 21:54.875
- Yes, but I'm just running
across the street.

22:06.083 --> 22:09.125
- Miss Brook.
- Mr. Russell.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.708
Larry.

22:10.791 --> 22:13.541
I mustn't hold you up,
but I have a favor to ask.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.083
Would you bring these
across the street

22:15.166 --> 22:16.583
before 7:00 this evening?

22:16.666 --> 22:18.500
- Could you manage that?
- Certainly.

22:18.583 --> 22:20.250
- I know you've got
your ball tonight.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.416
- I just hope it doesn't
betoken some desperate action

22:23.500 --> 22:24.625
on your part.

22:24.708 --> 22:27.416
- Some action, yes,
but not desperate.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.916
Thank you.

22:36.041 --> 22:39.208
- You left this.
- Thank you, John.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.000
Please tell the others
downstairs...

22:42.083 --> 22:44.291
Yes, Miss?

22:44.375 --> 22:46.333
How much I value them.

22:57.833 --> 23:00.791
<i>- I wonder what Miss Brook</i>
<i>is up to.</i>

23:00.875 --> 23:04.125
- She's quite convincing
when she makes a decision.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.000
It was she who said
I should tell you

23:06.083 --> 23:07.791
about my plans
to be an architect.

23:07.875 --> 23:09.791
Should I be glad of that?

23:09.875 --> 23:13.833
- I think you will be...
in the end.

23:13.916 --> 23:16.458
This is a great city
in a great country

23:16.541 --> 23:18.791
at a great time in our history.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.666
I want to be part of it,
Father.

23:31.666 --> 23:34.250
- They'll need solvent to get
the stain out of this,

23:34.333 --> 23:35.750
and I'll get them to press it.

23:35.833 --> 23:38.500
Mr. Scott left this
in his pocket, ma'am.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.708
Typical man, not to check.

24:11.833 --> 24:13.833
Oh.

24:25.666 --> 24:27.666
- Thank you for having me here,
Mrs. Chamberlain.

24:27.750 --> 24:31.750
- I have broken rules
I don't agree with all my life.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.583
- While we're waiting
for Mr. Raikes...

24:33.666 --> 24:34.666
What is it?

24:34.750 --> 24:36.916
I painted this for you

24:37.000 --> 24:40.500
as a way of saying thank you
for all your help, but...

24:40.583 --> 24:41.875
But what?

24:41.958 --> 24:44.416
- I just realized
it's like asking for my work

24:44.500 --> 24:47.666
to be hung alongside
all of the old masters.

24:47.750 --> 24:52.541
- I assure you I will value
it highly, my dear...

24:52.625 --> 24:55.000
Oh...

24:55.083 --> 24:57.125
For many reasons.

24:58.458 --> 25:01.166
- Dear Mrs. Fane,
please come in.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.708
Thank you, Bannister.

25:02.791 --> 25:06.125
- Is Miss Marian at home?
- I'm afraid she's out, madam.

25:06.208 --> 25:07.958
Aurora? Is that you?

25:08.041 --> 25:09.916
I was looking for Marian.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.375
Come inside, why don't you?

25:11.458 --> 25:13.083
Will Marian be back soon?

25:13.166 --> 25:14.916
No, I don't believe so.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.375
That's a pity.

25:16.458 --> 25:18.958
Why?

25:19.041 --> 25:20.500
What's the matter?

25:20.583 --> 25:22.583
- Something I saw
at the Academy last night--

25:22.666 --> 25:24.666
Marian should know about it.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.125
- Are you going to tell me
what it is?

25:27.208 --> 25:31.083
- It won't bother you since
you don't care for Mr. Raikes.

25:31.166 --> 25:33.041
He was there
in the Drexels' box,

25:33.125 --> 25:36.375
which is next to ours, and...

25:36.458 --> 25:38.083
he was talking--

25:38.166 --> 25:40.625
well, he was more than talking
to Miss Bingham.

25:40.708 --> 25:42.708
Do you know who I mean--
Cissie Bingham?

25:42.791 --> 25:43.875
I don't think so.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.958
- She's a niece
of Henry Flagler.

25:46.041 --> 25:48.333
- She's very rich.
- And?

25:48.416 --> 25:52.625
- At one point, he leaned over
and whispered in her ear.

25:52.708 --> 25:54.958
Well, she was transported.

25:55.041 --> 25:58.250
And every minute after that,
she clung to his arm.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.500
I see.

26:00.583 --> 26:03.291
- Maybe I'm making
too much of it.

26:03.375 --> 26:05.041
You're right.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.750
Marian should know.

26:06.833 --> 26:08.750
Will you tell her tonight?

26:08.833 --> 26:10.875
- She needs to know
sooner than that.

26:10.958 --> 26:12.958
But where is she?

26:13.041 --> 26:14.416
- She's--

26:17.125 --> 26:19.125
She's at the house
of Mrs. Chamberlain.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.583
What?

26:20.666 --> 26:23.166
- Has she told Aunt Agnes?
- No.

26:23.250 --> 26:24.875
And you won't either.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.333
Now go to Mrs. Chamberlain's
at once.

26:28.416 --> 26:29.875
- Fast as you can.
- Why?

26:29.958 --> 26:31.625
Just do it.

26:31.708 --> 26:35.208
Marian will explain
if she wants to.

26:38.416 --> 26:42.000
- Mr. Cuyper, Mr. Russell.
- It's kind of you to see me.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.458
- Not at all.

26:43.541 --> 26:45.875
So shall we get straight
to the point?

26:45.958 --> 26:47.666
We're good for the loan?

26:47.750 --> 26:48.791
Yes.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.125
You may have overextended
yourselves a little,

26:51.208 --> 26:52.458
but there is nothing
fundamentally wrong

26:52.541 --> 26:54.125
with Kneynsberg and Cuyper.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.916
So I'll have the papers
drawn up for signature.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.333
Thank you.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.708
Now, I shan't take up any more
of your valuable time.

27:00.791 --> 27:03.000
There is one more thing...

27:03.083 --> 27:05.916
an invitation to a ball my wife
is giving this evening--

27:06.000 --> 27:07.375
for you and Mrs. Cuyper.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.875
I look forward
to seeing you there.

27:08.958 --> 27:10.666
Alas, with no warning,

27:10.750 --> 27:13.875
I'm now sure
our diaries will allow it.

27:13.958 --> 27:16.750
I've not made myself clear.

27:16.833 --> 27:20.291
I will see you there
if you want the loan.

27:20.375 --> 27:21.875
You can't be serious.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.750
- Don't think
you can go elsewhere.

27:23.833 --> 27:26.625
I have a list of reasons
why not to invest in your bank,

27:26.708 --> 27:28.541
and I will send it
to anyone you approach.

27:28.625 --> 27:31.833
- Isn't that against the law?
- Let's find out.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.208
You are not a gentleman, sir.

27:35.291 --> 27:37.958
- That's a subject
for another time.

27:38.041 --> 27:39.375
- Very well.
I will attend.

27:39.458 --> 27:41.833
But I cannot promise
that my wife will.

27:41.916 --> 27:43.833
- The loan hinges
on her presence.

27:43.916 --> 27:47.916
- But suppose
she is engaged tonight?

27:48.000 --> 27:51.041
- I am sure,
when you explain the situation,

27:51.125 --> 27:54.125
she will find
that she can join us after all.

28:05.041 --> 28:06.958
I am Mrs. Astor.

28:07.041 --> 28:09.125
Perhaps
you can ask Mrs. Russell

28:09.208 --> 28:11.500
if she could see me
for a minute.

28:11.583 --> 28:13.583
I'm afraid I'm unexpected.

28:17.708 --> 28:18.916
If you'd be so kind...

28:19.000 --> 28:21.083
- Yes, ma'am.
Of course, ma'am.

28:25.958 --> 28:28.916
Mrs. Astor is in the hall.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.375
What?

28:30.458 --> 28:33.166
- She wonders
if you have time to see her.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.791
- I hope
this isn't a bad moment.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.833
- Not at all.
Won't you sit down?

28:58.333 --> 29:00.791
- I gather my daughter Caroline
will not now dance

29:00.875 --> 29:02.458
at your ball tonight.

29:02.541 --> 29:04.750
Indeed,
she is no longer invited.

29:04.833 --> 29:07.458
- Is that correct?
- It is.

29:07.541 --> 29:09.708
Mrs. Russell, I'm afraid

29:09.791 --> 29:11.833
there's been
a misunderstanding.

29:11.916 --> 29:14.375
When you were good enough
to pay a call on me,

29:14.458 --> 29:16.000
I had promised myself
to a friend

29:16.083 --> 29:18.833
who urgently wished
to speak to me alone.

29:18.916 --> 29:22.000
There is no reason here
for us to fall out.

29:22.083 --> 29:24.000
- Forgive me,
but if that were the case,

29:24.083 --> 29:26.166
you could have called on me
another day

29:26.250 --> 29:28.541
or written a note to explain
why I was turned away

29:28.625 --> 29:29.875
while others were admitted.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.625
Not others.

29:31.708 --> 29:33.500
Another was admitted.

29:33.583 --> 29:34.791
Ah.

29:37.583 --> 29:40.041
Well, I have paid a call now.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.916
You have dropped by

29:42.000 --> 29:44.916
at a time when no one else
was likely to be here.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.958
Won't you consider

29:48.041 --> 29:51.625
letting Carrie be included
in the fun after all?

29:51.708 --> 29:53.291
Would you come with her?

29:53.375 --> 29:55.416
- It is such a difficult time
of year for me--

29:55.500 --> 29:57.750
- If you wish for me to bring
your very charming daughter

29:57.833 --> 29:59.916
back into the fold,
then you must accompany her.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.208
- My being here now
is not enough?

30:02.291 --> 30:04.333
People know of the snub.

30:04.416 --> 30:06.875
So, to undo the hurt, you
must attend the ball tonight,

30:06.958 --> 30:09.041
and you must let people know
you will be here.

30:09.125 --> 30:11.875
- You will need to move quickly.
- I don't have time to do that.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.541
Oh, I think you do.

30:13.625 --> 30:15.416
And I have one more request.

30:15.500 --> 30:16.750
I want you to make sure
that my neighbors,

30:16.833 --> 30:18.500
Mrs. Van Rhijn and her sister,
will attend.

30:18.583 --> 30:19.875
Why bother with them?

30:19.958 --> 30:22.625
- I'm tired of being cut
on my own doorstep.

30:22.708 --> 30:24.375
Make them come.

30:24.458 --> 30:25.916
I don't see how.

30:26.000 --> 30:28.125
- Then you will have
to explain it to Carrie.

30:28.208 --> 30:29.791
I like her very much,
by the way.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.291
I'm sorry she won't be here.

30:33.208 --> 30:35.166
Well...

30:35.250 --> 30:37.458
at least we know
where we stand.

30:37.541 --> 30:38.625
Mm.

30:41.708 --> 30:43.250
Nothing would give me
more pleasure

30:43.333 --> 30:44.916
than for you
to change your mind.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.208
- But you
will not change yours?

30:48.291 --> 30:49.250
No.

30:51.500 --> 30:53.875
Mrs. Astor is leaving.

31:08.791 --> 31:10.708
- Your carriage is ready,
ma'am.

31:19.750 --> 31:22.125
- Well, Mrs. Bruce, what does
that mean for the mistress?

31:22.208 --> 31:24.458
Time will tell, Mr. Watson.

31:24.541 --> 31:27.333
Time will tell.

31:27.416 --> 31:30.291
- I don't believe you.
- What do you mean?

31:30.375 --> 31:31.833
- Well,
of course I believe you.

31:31.916 --> 31:33.833
I just don't think it can
have been quite how it looked.

31:33.916 --> 31:36.416
- Then where is he?
When was he expected?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.916
- Hours ago.
- But it may--

31:39.000 --> 31:41.250
it may have been difficult
for him to get away.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.625
- Wouldn't he have sent someone
with a message?

31:43.708 --> 31:45.000
Maybe he's been hurt.

31:45.083 --> 31:49.125
- Unless he's been killed,
he could have sent a warning.

31:49.208 --> 31:50.916
- All right, well,
I'll go to his office

31:51.000 --> 31:53.416
- to see if something's happened.
- Will he be at his office?

31:53.500 --> 31:55.750
- Take the carriage
and start with his office.

31:55.833 --> 31:58.208
Maybe someone there will know
where he might be found.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.666
- But suppose
he's on his way here?

31:59.750 --> 32:02.166
- I'll look after him
until your return.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.500
- Do you want me
to come with you?

32:03.583 --> 32:05.958
- I've already wasted quite
enough of your time as it is.

32:06.041 --> 32:09.500
- I'll go.
That was the original plan.

32:16.958 --> 32:18.958
- Is there anything more
I can do?

32:19.041 --> 32:21.125
- No.

32:21.208 --> 32:24.125
But thank you for receiving me.

32:24.208 --> 32:26.666
And thank you for your kindness
to my cousin.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.500
May I ask you to keep silent
about the whole affair?

32:36.583 --> 32:39.916
- Marian's reputation--
- Is safe with me. Don't worry.

32:47.125 --> 32:49.833
- But if I don't
maintain standards,

32:49.916 --> 32:51.291
what is the point of me?

32:51.375 --> 32:54.500
- Of course. But what we need
to determine now

32:54.583 --> 32:57.583
is whether Mrs. Russell
will support those standards

32:57.666 --> 32:59.541
or undermine them.

32:59.625 --> 33:01.208
How can you ask?

33:01.291 --> 33:04.041
- You know I follow your lead
to a slavish degree.

33:04.125 --> 33:07.333
- But you want
to go to the ball.

33:07.416 --> 33:11.166
- We cannot hope to keep out
the new people entirely,

33:11.250 --> 33:13.291
or they'd form
their own society

33:13.375 --> 33:15.166
that would exclude us.

33:15.250 --> 33:17.791
- You know this.
- Yes.

33:17.875 --> 33:19.791
And if it looks
as if her children

33:19.875 --> 33:21.500
might make decent marriages,
then I--

33:21.583 --> 33:24.166
- They'll make decent marriages
without our help.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.416
They're good-looking,
and they smell of money--

33:26.500 --> 33:28.291
the sweetest scent I know.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.958
If I were you,
I'd bring them in now

33:31.041 --> 33:32.541
and gain the credit.

33:32.625 --> 33:34.750
But it's tonight.

33:34.833 --> 33:36.416
- Send a note to her
this minute

33:36.500 --> 33:38.875
and another to Agnes van Rhijn.

33:38.958 --> 33:40.083
Ugh.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.916
- Then write to anyone else
you can think of.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.375
- You mean that you don't think
that I can beat Mrs. Russell

33:44.458 --> 33:46.375
at my own game?

33:46.458 --> 33:49.000
My dear mystic rose,

33:49.083 --> 33:51.166
I fear if you try,

33:51.250 --> 33:55.750
it might be at the cost
of your own dignity.

33:55.833 --> 34:00.333
- Which translated means
you want to go to her ball.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.958
This can't be right.

34:06.041 --> 34:07.250
What's that?

34:07.333 --> 34:09.666
- She's taken leave
of her senses.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.000
- Who?
- Lina Astor. Listen.

34:13.083 --> 34:15.458
"If you consider yourselves
to be my friends,

34:15.541 --> 34:18.500
you will attend Mrs. Russell's
ball this evening."

34:18.583 --> 34:19.500
Really?

34:19.583 --> 34:21.333
- Don't you dare
sound cheerful.

34:21.416 --> 34:23.750
- I am curious
about that house.

34:23.833 --> 34:26.541
- Really? You are glad to be
ordered to march into hell

34:26.625 --> 34:28.083
and to dance with the devil?

34:28.166 --> 34:29.458
I wonder sometimes

34:29.541 --> 34:32.416
if you don't slightly overstate
your arguments.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.750
We cannot be forced to dance.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.416
- So are we to quarrel
with Mrs. Astor

34:37.500 --> 34:39.291
- or Mrs. Russell?
- Well--

34:39.375 --> 34:41.750
- I do not wish to quarrel
with Mrs. Astor,

34:41.833 --> 34:43.708
so we will obey her now

34:43.791 --> 34:45.416
but reserve the right
to quarrel

34:45.500 --> 34:48.041
with Mrs. Russell later.

34:56.041 --> 34:58.333
- I've been trying
to compose a letter.

34:58.416 --> 35:00.458
Well, now you won't have to.

35:02.416 --> 35:05.000
I assume we're not getting
married today?

35:05.083 --> 35:06.708
- Marian--
- Just tell me.

35:08.375 --> 35:11.500
- Was it all pretend?
- No.

35:11.583 --> 35:13.625
Of course not.
I love you very much.

35:13.708 --> 35:15.166
- But as New York smiled
on you,

35:15.250 --> 35:16.458
you came to see
that there were others

35:16.541 --> 35:18.125
who could offer you
so much more than I could?

35:18.208 --> 35:19.125
- The truth is--

35:19.208 --> 35:20.125
- I'll tell you
what the truth is.

35:20.208 --> 35:21.875
The more you pushed
for our elopement,

35:21.958 --> 35:25.333
the more you felt your desire
for it slipping away.

35:25.416 --> 35:27.750
- I suppose I thought that
if I could only make it happen,

35:27.833 --> 35:30.625
then things would come right.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.541
But I began to suspect
that if we did marry,

35:32.625 --> 35:34.875
we would have no armory
for the battle that lay ahead.

35:34.958 --> 35:38.000
We'd have no money, you mean.

35:38.083 --> 35:41.041
- We know New York now,
you and I.

35:41.125 --> 35:44.208
There's a life to be lived
here, and a good life.

35:44.291 --> 35:46.083
But two penniless strangers
from out of town

35:46.166 --> 35:47.666
could not have hoped
to live it.

35:47.750 --> 35:51.208
- But Miss Bingham can make
sure of that life for you?

35:51.291 --> 35:53.166
Well, why not?

35:53.250 --> 35:54.833
She won't suit the old crowd,

35:54.916 --> 35:56.500
but she'll do well enough
with the new,

35:56.583 --> 35:59.666
and her fortune is more
than ample for both of you.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.250
I don't admire myself for it.

36:05.083 --> 36:07.583
On that note,
I'll say goodbye.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.791
- Can we at least part
as friends?

36:18.125 --> 36:19.541
Not quite.

36:21.833 --> 36:24.250
But not as enemies either.

36:24.333 --> 36:26.291
I don't like bitterness.

36:28.291 --> 36:31.000
- You're a marvelous person,
Marian.

36:31.083 --> 36:33.166
Do you know that?

36:33.250 --> 36:36.083
- I shall take it
as my consolation prize.

36:49.208 --> 36:53.125
Come away, come away.

36:53.208 --> 36:54.625
Your bag's in the carriage.

36:54.708 --> 36:57.166
There's no need to go back
to Mrs. Chamberlain's.

36:57.250 --> 36:59.791
Go home,
and I'll return to Brooklyn.

36:59.875 --> 37:03.125
- Oh, the letters.

37:03.208 --> 37:06.125
I must stop Larry
from delivering the letters.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.291
Thank you.

37:10.375 --> 37:11.833
Of course.

37:19.583 --> 37:22.250
Hefty said you wanted me.

37:22.333 --> 37:24.708
Only to witness my defeat.

37:24.791 --> 37:26.375
<i>You have won.</i>

37:26.458 --> 37:28.791
- Adelheid said
you were looking for me.

37:28.875 --> 37:29.958
Only to tell you

37:30.041 --> 37:31.916
that Carrie Astor
is coming tonight after all.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.541
So you will perform the dance
as it was rehearsed.

37:34.625 --> 37:36.458
- Send messages now
to your friends

37:36.541 --> 37:37.666
that I will be there tonight,

37:37.750 --> 37:39.833
starting with the parents
of the other dancers.

37:39.916 --> 37:41.500
You won't regret it.

37:41.583 --> 37:43.500
I regret it already.

37:43.583 --> 37:45.625
Oh, Mother.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.833
<i>What am I to do?</i>

37:47.916 --> 37:50.541
I'm alone
since your father's never here.

37:53.125 --> 37:55.833
How can I manage
without my darling daughter?

38:05.333 --> 38:07.875
- Bannister, there's a bag
of clothes in the carriage.

38:07.958 --> 38:09.666
I need to sort them
for the missionary barrel.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.291
Will you ask John to take them
up to my room?

38:11.375 --> 38:12.500
Of course, Miss Marian.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.916
- And when Mr. Russell arrives,
please ask him to wait

38:15.000 --> 38:16.041
and come and fetch me.

38:16.125 --> 38:17.541
- He's already here.
- What?

38:17.625 --> 38:19.541
- I've just shown him in
to the drawing room.

38:22.291 --> 38:23.625
Am I too late?

38:23.708 --> 38:25.000
Heavens, is there a fire?

38:25.083 --> 38:26.208
Marian, you're back.

38:26.291 --> 38:28.333
- Too late for what?
Why shouldn't she be back?

38:28.416 --> 38:30.833
- What's going on?
- How was your day?

38:30.916 --> 38:32.541
Not all it could have been.

38:32.625 --> 38:35.750
Mr. Russell, how kind of you
to come by.

38:35.833 --> 38:38.666
- You were saying you were here
on a mission, Mr. Russell?

38:38.750 --> 38:40.875
Does it concern
those envelopes?

38:40.958 --> 38:42.416
- No.
- What?

38:42.500 --> 38:44.291
- I'm sure Mr. Russell went out
to catch the evening post

38:44.375 --> 38:47.416
and thought he'd look in
to see how you are.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.666
Isn't that so, Mr. Russell?

38:49.750 --> 38:51.375
Absolutely.

38:51.458 --> 38:55.000
But now it's clear you're both
as well as I could hope.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.208
- So I'll be on my way.
- To the mailbox?

38:57.291 --> 38:59.416
- Isn't that nice?

38:59.500 --> 39:01.250
I'll see you out.

39:03.916 --> 39:05.750
- I feel as if I've been
watching a play

39:05.833 --> 39:08.416
- in a foreign language.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.125
They're young.

39:10.208 --> 39:13.125
- Is that an observation
or an excuse?

39:13.208 --> 39:14.500
Both.

39:14.583 --> 39:17.250
- Are you gonna tell me
what that was about?

39:17.333 --> 39:19.333
Someday maybe.

39:20.666 --> 39:23.041
- But thank you.
I am so grateful.

39:23.125 --> 39:24.916
Of course.

39:28.291 --> 39:30.083
Are you coming to Gladys' ball?

39:30.166 --> 39:32.916
- I may regret it,
but I suppose I am.

39:33.000 --> 39:36.041
- Then I claim a waltz
as my payment.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.083
When was it written?

39:53.166 --> 39:54.958
Three weeks ago.

39:55.041 --> 39:57.458
- Is there an address?
- No.

39:57.541 --> 40:01.375
Just the date and a name--
Mrs. Wade.

40:01.458 --> 40:03.250
The postmark's
from Philadelphia.

40:03.333 --> 40:04.750
See for yourself.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.416
"The boy is doing well."

40:14.666 --> 40:18.166
And we are to assume
this boy is my son?

40:18.250 --> 40:21.500
- Why else would your father
have made inquiries?

40:21.583 --> 40:24.500
- Did you know?
- I did not.

40:24.583 --> 40:28.291
I accepted what I was told
when he brought you home.

40:28.375 --> 40:30.708
He stole my child.

40:30.791 --> 40:32.666
And all the time
he was working

40:32.750 --> 40:34.625
and sitting down
to dinner with us

40:34.708 --> 40:36.875
- and living a lie.
- You--

40:36.958 --> 40:38.041
He wasn't in his right mind.

40:38.125 --> 40:39.916
- Please don't make excuses
for him!

40:40.000 --> 40:42.416
I'm not, but I don't know

40:42.500 --> 40:45.791
what good can come of this.

40:45.875 --> 40:48.500
We won't find the boy,
and Arthur won't help us.

40:48.583 --> 40:50.041
Us?

40:51.833 --> 40:54.083
Have you come over to my side?

40:54.166 --> 40:57.791
- I've always been
on your side.

40:57.875 --> 40:59.916
My baby is alive, Mama.

41:00.000 --> 41:03.708
My baby is alive,
and I want him back.

41:11.583 --> 41:14.250
Oh, God help us.

41:32.041 --> 41:33.958
Perfect timing.

41:36.500 --> 41:39.458
Let the tournament begin.

42:05.333 --> 42:08.166
- Mr. and
Mrs. Winthrop Chandler.

42:10.125 --> 42:11.833
The Drexels.

42:11.916 --> 42:14.750
Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Drexel.

42:23.791 --> 42:25.625
- I'm afraid there's trouble
in the kitchens

42:25.708 --> 42:27.916
- with Monsieur Charron.
- Can you sort it out?

42:28.000 --> 42:28.916
Of course.

42:35.208 --> 42:38.000
Mr. and Mrs. Robert McNeil.

42:43.708 --> 42:46.458
- Mr. McNeil, Mrs. McNeil,
how wonderful to see you.

42:46.541 --> 42:48.791
- Thank you for having us.
- The pleasure is ours.

42:48.875 --> 42:51.083
- Mr. Russell,
I think you've met Mr. McNeil.

42:51.166 --> 42:52.750
May I present
his lovely wife...

42:52.833 --> 42:56.166
Mr. and Mrs. Ogden Mills.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.291
- How long
has he been like this?

43:06.375 --> 43:08.166
- It's been coming on,
Mr. Church.

43:08.250 --> 43:09.500
- How much of the supper
is ready?

43:09.583 --> 43:11.541
- They've got the cold, but
they've still to cook the hot.

43:11.625 --> 43:13.500
Monsieur Charron did not want
the food kept warm

43:13.583 --> 43:14.458
for too long.

43:14.541 --> 43:17.833
- Monsieur Charron!

43:17.916 --> 43:20.166
Can you hear me?

43:22.583 --> 43:24.791
- How much time do we have
before the supper is served?

43:24.875 --> 43:26.500
Three to four hours.

43:29.041 --> 43:31.791
- You, take this note to
the address I've written there.

43:31.875 --> 43:32.875
Yes, sir.

43:32.958 --> 43:35.458
- You and you two,
put Monsieur Charron to bed.

43:35.541 --> 43:37.416
Ah!

43:41.208 --> 43:43.875
- Are we really determined
on this?

43:43.958 --> 43:46.291
Marian looks so beautiful.

43:46.375 --> 43:49.041
It would be a shame
not to show her off.

43:49.125 --> 43:51.708
How are you feeling, my dear?

43:51.791 --> 43:53.500
Just dandy.

43:53.583 --> 43:56.375
- How can she have gotten
round Lina?

43:56.458 --> 43:58.208
I never believed
in black magic,

43:58.291 --> 43:59.541
but I'm having my doubts.

43:59.625 --> 44:02.000
- Did Mrs. Astor explain
why she wanted you to come?

44:02.083 --> 44:03.916
- She didn't explain it,
she ordered it,

44:04.000 --> 44:05.208
as simple as that.

44:05.291 --> 44:09.416
- I suppose you don't have
to go just because she said so.

44:09.500 --> 44:12.208
- Never overestimate
your own power, my dear.

44:12.291 --> 44:14.041
It's always a mistake.

44:19.333 --> 44:21.833
- So Mrs. Russell won
the battle after all.

44:21.916 --> 44:24.333
- I'm not so sure
it's over yet.

44:24.416 --> 44:26.833
You wish you'd been invited?

44:26.916 --> 44:28.666
I suppose.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.625
What about you?

44:30.708 --> 44:33.583
Maybe we will be one day.

44:33.666 --> 44:36.125
After all, this is America.

44:41.083 --> 44:43.583
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Fane.

44:48.000 --> 44:49.416
Mr. Russell.

44:49.500 --> 44:53.000
- Mr. and Mrs. Julius Cuyper.
- Oh?

44:54.791 --> 44:56.541
How did you manage that?

44:56.625 --> 44:58.875
I just asked them nicely.

44:58.958 --> 45:00.416
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

45:00.500 --> 45:02.208
I'm so glad you could join us.

45:02.291 --> 45:04.958
- We found our diaries
would allow it.

45:05.041 --> 45:06.916
Thank you for coming.

45:08.666 --> 45:11.583
- Mrs. Arnold van Rhijn,
Miss Brook,

45:11.666 --> 45:13.291
and Miss Marian Brook.

45:13.375 --> 45:17.041
- Aunt Agnes, Aunt Ada.
What are you doing here?

45:17.125 --> 45:18.291
You may well ask.

45:18.375 --> 45:21.041
Lina Astor wrote saying
it was a test of friendship.

45:21.125 --> 45:22.833
But now that we're here,

45:22.916 --> 45:24.875
there are
so many familiar faces.

45:24.958 --> 45:28.166
- No doubt they've all had
their hands held in the flame.

45:28.250 --> 45:29.458
Mama?

45:29.541 --> 45:32.916
You are the last woman on Earth
I thought I'd see tonight.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.708
- And you're the last man
on Earth

45:34.791 --> 45:36.375
I'd allow to criticize me.

45:38.708 --> 45:40.458
- People are going through
to the ballroom.

45:40.541 --> 45:42.500
- They won't start dancing
until I say.

45:42.583 --> 45:43.541
What are you waiting for?

45:43.625 --> 45:45.583
- Mrs. William Backhouse
Astor...

45:45.666 --> 45:50.291
And Miss Caroline Astor.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.583
That.

46:01.458 --> 46:03.666
Mrs. Astor,
how good of you to come.

46:03.750 --> 46:07.333
- How kind you are
to receive me, Mrs. Russell.

46:07.416 --> 46:09.833
Mr. Ward McAllister.

46:11.583 --> 46:14.875
Mrs. Astor, Mrs. Russell.

46:14.958 --> 46:17.625
- Mr. McAllister.
- Well, here we are...

46:17.708 --> 46:20.416
- Mm.
- All of us together.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.916
What could be nicer?

46:22.000 --> 46:25.166
- Have a lovely time.
- Thank you.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.166
- Shall we?
- Ah.

47:00.458 --> 47:02.666
Oh, wonderful.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.583
- How charming they look.
- I think so.

47:35.666 --> 47:37.625
- Didn't it ever worry you
that I might decide

47:37.708 --> 47:40.875
to destroy you
after this evening?

47:40.958 --> 47:42.916
Because I could, if I chose.

47:43.000 --> 47:45.708
- I don't doubt it,
but you won't.

47:45.791 --> 47:47.708
Oh. Why not?

47:47.791 --> 47:50.500
Because we're too alike.

47:50.583 --> 47:52.708
- We're what?
- It's true.

47:52.791 --> 47:55.375
And I will be a good friend
to you if you'll let me.

48:07.041 --> 48:08.625
That was nice of you.

48:08.708 --> 48:10.125
- I've already said--

48:10.208 --> 48:13.083
if necessary,
we can quarrel with her later.

48:30.333 --> 48:31.458
Come and dance with me.

48:31.541 --> 48:33.083
- But I have to change
my dress.

48:33.166 --> 48:35.500
- You can do that later.
Dance with me.

48:35.583 --> 48:38.208
And I'll leave you alone
for the rest of the evening.

48:38.291 --> 48:40.208
- You'll have to wait
while I change.

48:40.291 --> 48:42.041
I'm out now, Mr. Van Rhijn.

48:42.125 --> 48:44.833
And I've had enough
of being told what to do.

49:36.458 --> 49:38.916
- Henry Flagler
and his party are here.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.708
They must have arrived late.

49:42.750 --> 49:44.666
I'm sorry
I couldn't stop it, Marian.

49:44.750 --> 49:46.166
But I'm afraid

49:46.250 --> 49:50.083
Mr. Flagler trumps
any sort of influence I have.

49:54.791 --> 49:56.125
Miss Brook.

49:56.208 --> 49:57.666
Mrs. Fane.

49:57.750 --> 49:59.916
- Miss Marian.
- I shouldn't be surprised.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.041
You're quite the man about town
these days.

50:05.166 --> 50:08.458
Aurora, I see Mrs. Russell.

50:08.541 --> 50:11.083
Let's pay our compliments
to the hostess.

50:18.708 --> 50:20.708
I'm so sorry.

50:20.791 --> 50:22.458
I didn't think you'd be here.

50:22.541 --> 50:24.625
I assumed your aunt
wouldn't allow it.

50:24.708 --> 50:26.500
I wouldn't have come
if I'd known.

50:26.583 --> 50:28.708
- Had you decided
to break your word?

50:30.333 --> 50:32.625
Did you know when we met
in the park?

50:33.791 --> 50:34.958
No.

50:36.833 --> 50:39.875
And I meant it
when I said I love you.

50:39.958 --> 50:41.666
I believe you.

50:43.250 --> 50:45.541
But love is not always enough.

51:09.166 --> 51:10.166
Miss Brook.

51:12.208 --> 51:15.041
You promised me a waltz.

51:15.125 --> 51:18.500
Uh, I saw you talking
to Mr. Raikes.

51:18.583 --> 51:22.583
- Oh, yes, he's just someone
I used to know.

51:22.666 --> 51:24.958
Let's dance.

52:09.875 --> 52:12.291
- Do you think Mrs. Astor will
accept your hand at friendship?

52:12.375 --> 52:14.208
- No one would believe it,
but who knows?

52:14.291 --> 52:16.166
- Well,
that's all for tomorrow.

52:16.250 --> 52:18.000
Tonight
you're the belle of the ball.

52:26.833 --> 52:28.750
She looks beautiful.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.833
- You beat me to it.
- Not by much.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.375
You seemed to be making headway
with Gladys.

53:34.208 --> 53:35.625
So did you.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.750
Why are you scowling?

53:39.833 --> 53:42.458
You're so easy to tease.

53:45.291 --> 53:48.458
I think I can do it, John.

53:48.541 --> 53:51.833
I think I can reel her in.

53:51.916 --> 53:54.416
And don't worry.

53:54.500 --> 53:57.333
Nothing will change.

54:04.666 --> 54:06.250
Dorothy.

54:09.208 --> 54:11.250
There you are.

54:11.333 --> 54:15.500
Did you not hear me calling
from downstairs?

54:15.583 --> 54:16.958
We heard.

54:17.041 --> 54:18.666
- Well, I've been traveling
all night,

54:18.750 --> 54:21.333
and I expect a warmer welcome
than that.

54:23.583 --> 54:26.208
Your mother's cable
said you were back,

54:26.291 --> 54:28.125
but this looks like
you're leaving us again.

54:28.208 --> 54:30.333
We're both leaving.

54:30.416 --> 54:31.916
Where are you going?

54:33.750 --> 54:36.833
This is my house, and somebody
had better answer me.

54:36.916 --> 54:39.750
- I come back--
- We know, Father.

54:41.333 --> 54:42.625
Know what?

54:46.625 --> 54:49.041
- You've no proof.
- You don't know what we have.

54:49.125 --> 54:51.958
- We have proof
the boy didn't die.

54:52.041 --> 54:54.333
We believe he was adopted,
and you knew.

54:54.416 --> 54:56.541
- If you're expecting me
to say I'm sorry--

54:56.625 --> 54:58.375
- We'd never be so foolish
as to expect that.

54:58.458 --> 55:00.583
- Then what do you want
from me?

55:01.958 --> 55:04.708
- We are catching
an early train to Philadelphia.

55:04.791 --> 55:07.375
We intent to find my son.

55:07.458 --> 55:09.166
And we'd like your assistance.

55:09.250 --> 55:11.208
You won't get it.

55:11.291 --> 55:13.250
And you won't find him.

55:13.333 --> 55:14.916
Leave him alone.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.541
He's happy now and settled.
I made sure of that.

55:18.625 --> 55:20.375
Do you think it wasn't hard
for me?

55:20.458 --> 55:22.458
- You should be ashamed
of yourself.

55:22.541 --> 55:23.708
Why?

55:23.791 --> 55:25.791
Because I freed our daughter
and our grandson

55:25.875 --> 55:27.833
from a life of shame?

55:27.916 --> 55:31.416
Everything I done was done
for Peggy and the boy.

55:31.500 --> 55:34.041
- I don't want to be free
of my own child.

55:34.125 --> 55:36.500
- Then ruin yourself
if you must,

55:36.583 --> 55:41.250
but you'll do it
without any help from me.

55:57.541 --> 55:59.000
Shall we say goodbye here?

55:59.083 --> 56:00.916
- I think I must be allowed
to see you safely

56:01.000 --> 56:02.208
to your front door...

56:03.625 --> 56:06.166
Especially
after tonight's bruising.

56:06.250 --> 56:08.791
- I shouldn't have told you.
- Of course you should.

56:10.291 --> 56:12.208
How do you feel?

56:12.291 --> 56:14.208
About Mr. Raikes?

56:15.500 --> 56:17.250
I'm not sure.

56:17.333 --> 56:20.458
Rather numb, really.

56:20.541 --> 56:22.375
Numb is good.

56:22.458 --> 56:24.333
Just look after yourself
when it wears off.

56:47.666 --> 56:50.333
<i>- You offered Borden his job</i>
<i>back without speaking to me?</i>

56:50.416 --> 56:52.750
- Well, madam, I--
- I told him to, my dear.

56:52.833 --> 56:54.291
I'm a man of simple principles.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.458
I reward loyalty.
I punish traitors.

56:56.541 --> 56:57.958
- Well, they'll laugh
when they know

56:58.041 --> 56:59.791
- we have a chef from Kansas.
- Let them.

56:59.875 --> 57:03.041
Church summoned him, and
he came to our rescue at once.

57:03.125 --> 57:04.125
- Bu--

57:06.416 --> 57:09.458
- Thank you, Monsieur Bau--

57:09.541 --> 57:11.208
Thank you, Borden,

57:11.291 --> 57:12.958
for stepping in
at the last minute

57:13.041 --> 57:14.458
and saving the show.

57:14.541 --> 57:17.291
- I was glad to do it.
- Mm.

57:17.375 --> 57:19.250
And...

57:19.333 --> 57:21.916
we hope you will stay on?

57:22.000 --> 57:23.166
But...

57:23.250 --> 57:26.125
is Mrs. Russell content to have
a chef from Wichita, Kansas?

57:29.375 --> 57:32.458
- Couldn't we just call it
the Middle West?

57:56.625 --> 57:58.375
You're back.

58:01.416 --> 58:05.583
Did you enjoy it
in spite of Mr. Raikes?

58:05.666 --> 58:08.041
- The Flagler party left
when you did,

58:08.125 --> 58:11.083
- so the evening picked up.
- Mm.

58:11.166 --> 58:13.708
- It was kind of you
to let me stay on.

58:16.083 --> 58:18.208
- Will you ever explain
what happened?

58:20.166 --> 58:23.791
Someday maybe, but not now.

58:23.875 --> 58:25.750
It hurts too much.

58:28.500 --> 58:31.250
- Then get into bed
and sleep half the day away,

58:31.333 --> 58:33.666
- if you wish.

58:33.750 --> 58:35.958
This is your home, Marian.

58:36.041 --> 58:38.958
You're very welcome here.

58:39.041 --> 58:42.791
And things will get better.
You'll see.

58:42.875 --> 58:46.541
You still have
most of New York to explore

58:46.625 --> 58:48.875
and all the people in the city
to choose from.

58:52.958 --> 58:55.416
So good night, my dear.

59:03.125 --> 59:05.708
Or should I say good morning?
