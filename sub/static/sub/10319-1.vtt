02:29.149 --> 02:30.316
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.484
Oh, hello, Miss Daniels.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.654
Have you ever seen so many gulls?
What do you suppose it is?

02:34.738 --> 02:38.783
There must be a storm at sea. That
can drive them inland, you know.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.370
I was hoping you'd be a little late.
You see, he hasn't arrived yet.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.413
Oh, but you said 3:00.
Oh, I know.

02:44.623 --> 02:47.291
I know. I've been
calling all morning.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.627
Oh, Miss Daniels,
you have no idea.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.463
They are so difficult to get.
Really, they are.

02:52.548 --> 02:53.788
We have to get them from India,

02:53.841 --> 02:55.341
when they're just
baby chicks, and then...

02:55.425 --> 02:57.385
This one won't be
a chick, will he?

02:57.553 --> 02:59.887
Certainly not.
Oh, no, certainly not.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.892
This will be a full-grown mynah bird.
Full-grown.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.516
And he'll talk?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.768
Well, yes, of course he'll...

03:05.853 --> 03:09.230
Well, no, you'll have
to teach him to talk.

03:09.314 --> 03:13.401
I guess maybe I'd better phone.
They said 3:00.

03:13.485 --> 03:16.237
Maybe it's the traffic.
I'll call.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.613
Would you mind waiting?

03:17.698 --> 03:19.824
Well, maybe you'd
better deliver him.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.868
Let me give you my address.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.495
Oh, well, all right,

03:24.580 --> 03:27.248
but I'm sure they're on the way.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.001
Would you mind if I called?

03:30.085 --> 03:32.003
No. All right.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.147
I wonder if you could help me.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.273
What?

03:53.609 --> 03:55.089
I said, I wonder
if you could help me.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.823
Yes. What is it
you're looking for, sir?

04:01.825 --> 04:02.909
Lovebirds.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.493
Lovebirds, sir?

04:04.578 --> 04:06.537
Yes. I understand there
are different varieties.

04:06.622 --> 04:07.622
Is that true?

04:07.706 --> 04:08.915
Well, yes, there are.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.876
Well, these are for my sister
for her birthday, you see,

04:11.960 --> 04:13.836
and as she's only gonna be 11,

04:13.921 --> 04:15.161
I wouldn't want a pair of birds

04:15.172 --> 04:17.798
that were too demonstrative.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.175
I understand completely.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.011
At the same time, I wouldn't want
them to be too aloof, either.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.763
No, of course not.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.016
Do you happen to have a pair of
birds that are just friendly?

04:27.100 --> 04:31.896
Oh, I think so.
Now, then, let me see.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.319
Aren't those lovebirds?

04:39.196 --> 04:42.073
No. Those are red birds.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.575
I thought they were
strawberry finches.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.203
Yes. We call them that, too.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.290
Here we are. Lovebirds.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.877
Those are canaries.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.296
Doesn't this
make you feel awful?

04:57.381 --> 04:58.798
Doesn't what make me feel...

04:58.882 --> 05:02.093
Having all these poor, little innocent
creatures caged up like this?

05:02.177 --> 05:04.971
Well, we can't just let them
fly around the shop, you know.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.180
No, I suppose not.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.307
Is there
an ornithological reason

05:08.392 --> 05:10.476
for keeping them
in separate cages?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.812
Well, certainly. It's
to protect the species.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.481
Yes, that's important, especially
during the molting season.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.234
That's a particularly
dangerous time.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.194
Are they molting now?

05:20.278 --> 05:21.737
Oh, some of them are.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.322
How can you tell?

05:24.741 --> 05:28.995
Well, they get a sort
of hangdog expression.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.667
Yes, I see. Well, what
about the lovebirds?

05:34.751 --> 05:37.003
Are you sure you wouldn't
like to see a canary instead?

05:37.087 --> 05:39.505
We have some very
nice canaries this week.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.090
All right.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.260
All right.
May I see it, please?

05:58.942 --> 06:00.151
Oh! Oh!

06:01.445 --> 06:03.571
Oh, what is it? Oh!

06:17.919 --> 06:19.837
There we are.

06:19.921 --> 06:21.797
Oh, there.
Wonderful.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.470
Back in your gilded cage,
Melanie Daniels.

06:28.972 --> 06:30.306
What did you say?

06:30.974 --> 06:33.642
I was merely drawing
a parallel, Miss Daniels.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.311
How did you know my name?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.396
A little birdie told me.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.899
Good day,
Miss Daniels. Madam.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.692
Hey, wait a minute.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.070
I don't know you.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.571
Ah, but I know you.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.781
How?

06:46.865 --> 06:47.907
We met in court.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.576
We never met in court
or anyplace else.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.495
That's true. I'll rephrase it.
I saw you in court.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.704
When?

06:53.789 --> 06:55.998
Don't you remember
one of your practical jokes

06:56.083 --> 06:57.917
that resulted in the smashing
of a plate-glass window?

06:58.001 --> 06:59.919
I didn't break that window.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.545
Yes, but your little prank did.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.422
The judge should've
put you behind bars.

07:03.507 --> 07:06.175
What are you, a policeman?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.968
I merely believe in
the law, Miss Daniels.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.096
And I'm not too keen
on practical jokers.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.981
What do you call
your lovebird story if not...

07:12.099 --> 07:13.808
Oh, I really wanted
the lovebirds.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.644
Well, you knew I didn't work here.
You deliberately...

07:16.728 --> 07:18.771
Right. I recognized
you when I came in.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.523
I just thought you
might like to know

07:20.607 --> 07:22.233
what it's like to be on
the other end of a gag.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.442
What do you think of that?

07:23.527 --> 07:25.152
I think you're a louse.

07:25.237 --> 07:28.864
I am. Good day,
Miss Daniels. Madam.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.910
And I'm glad you didn't
get your lovebirds.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.789
Oh, I'll find something else.
See you in court.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.418
Who was that man?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.379
I have no idea.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.449
They said the mynah bird would
be here later this afternoon,

08:12.534 --> 08:13.993
if you care to come back.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.161
No, you'd better send him.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.245
May I use this phone?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.247
Why, certainly.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.426
Daily News?
It's Melanie Daniels.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.927
Could you get me
the City Desk, please?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.221
Just a minute,
Mrs. MacGruder.

08:35.222 --> 08:37.433
Hello, Charlie. Melanie.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.269
I want you to do a favor for me.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.438
No, this is a small one.

08:43.523 --> 08:48.194
Pressure you? Why, Charlie, darling,
would I try to pressure you?

08:48.445 --> 08:51.030
Would you call the Department
of Motor Vehicles for me?

08:51.114 --> 08:53.365
Find out who owns
this license plate,

08:53.450 --> 08:56.702
W-J-H-0-0-3.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.412
Yes, a California plate.

08:59.623 --> 09:02.541
No. I'll stop off in a little while.
Is Daddy in his office?

09:04.377 --> 09:08.130
No, I don't want to break in on a meeting.
Tell him I'll see him later.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.050
Thank you, Charlie.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.056
Do you have any lovebirds?

09:17.140 --> 09:21.894
Well, no, not in the shop,
but I can order them for you.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.020
How soon?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.064
Well, when would you want them?

09:25.148 --> 09:26.315
Immediately.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.734
Well, I could probably have
them here by tomorrow morning.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.319
Would that be all right?

09:30.403 --> 09:32.780
That would be just fine.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.416
Miss, is that for Mitch Brenner?

10:25.500 --> 10:26.500
Yes.

10:26.584 --> 10:27.751
He's not home.

10:27.836 --> 10:28.836
That's all right.

10:28.920 --> 10:32.089
He won't be back until Monday, I
mean, if those birds are for him.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.841
Monday?
Yes.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.336
I don't think you should leave
them in the hall, do you?

10:36.344 --> 10:38.345
Well... Where did he go?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.639
Bodega Bay. He goes
there every weekend.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.725
Bodega Bay.
Where's that?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.144
Up the coast, about 60
miles north of here.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.354
Sixty...

10:47.439 --> 10:49.648
It's an hour and
a half by freeway,

10:49.733 --> 10:51.483
or two hours if you
take the Coast Highway.

10:51.568 --> 10:52.901
Oh.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.529
I'd look after them myself,
but I'm going away, too.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.740
I'm awfully sorry.

12:48.059 --> 12:49.643
Good morning.
Good morning.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.103
I wonder if you could help me.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.229
I'll try my best.

12:52.814 --> 12:55.107
I'm looking for a man
named Mitchell Brenner.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.067
Do you know him?
Yeah.

12:57.152 --> 12:59.236
Where does he live?
Right here, Bodega Bay.

12:59.320 --> 13:00.946
Yes, I know, but where?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.739
Right across the bay there.

13:03.491 --> 13:04.700
Where?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.964
Now, see where I'm pointing?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.048
Yes.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.384
See them two big
trees across there?

13:22.469 --> 13:24.303
On the other side
of the bay? Yes.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.971
And the white house?
Yes.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.431
That's where the Brenners live.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.309
The Brenners?
Mr. And Mrs. Brenner?

13:30.393 --> 13:32.728
No. Just Lydia
and the two kids.

13:32.812 --> 13:33.937
The two kids?

13:34.022 --> 13:36.190
Yeah, Mitch and the little girl.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.984
Oh, I see.
How do I get down there?

13:39.068 --> 13:41.487
You follow
the road around the bay,

13:41.571 --> 13:43.572
and that'll take you
right to their front door.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.658
The front door. Is there
a back road I can take?

13:46.743 --> 13:48.660
No. That's the only road.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.412
You see,
I want to surprise them.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.122
Oh.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.957
I don't want them
to see me arrive.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.125
Oh.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.835
It's a surprise, you see.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.130
Well, you could
get yourself a boat

14:00.215 --> 14:02.966
and cut right across
the bay to their dock.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.384
Where would I get a boat?

14:05.887 --> 14:08.472
Down by the Tides Restaurant.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.891
Did you ever handle
an outboard boat?

14:10.975 --> 14:12.059
Of course.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.103
Want me to order one for you?

14:15.188 --> 14:17.481
Well, thank you.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.233
What name?
Daniels.

14:19.651 --> 14:20.776
Okay.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.707
I wonder if you could tell me...

14:35.792 --> 14:38.710
Yeah. Just hold it
a minute, please.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.379
The little girl's name?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.880
The little Brenner girl?

14:41.965 --> 14:43.048
Yes.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.299
Alice, I think.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.427
Harry, what's the little
Brenner girl's name?

14:47.971 --> 14:49.846
- Lois.
- Alice, isn't it?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.265
No, it's Lois.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.267
It's Alice.

14:54.018 --> 14:55.060
Are you sure?

14:55.144 --> 14:58.063
Well, I'm not positive,
if that's what you mean.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.148
I need her exact name, you see.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.652
Oh, just hold on one
more minute, please.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.154
In that case, I'll
tell you what you do.

15:06.239 --> 15:09.533
You go straight through town till you
see a little hotel on your left.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.743
Then you turn right there.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.453
Now, you got that?
Yes.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.456
Near the top of the hill, you'll
see the school, and just beyond,

15:16.541 --> 15:18.917
a little house
with a red mailbox.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.837
That's where Annie Hayworth,
the schoolteacher, lives.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.131
You ask her about
the little Brenner girl.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.257
Well, thank you.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.969
Save yourself a lot of trouble.
Name's Alice for sure.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.930
Can I have the boat
in about 20 minutes?

15:32.015 --> 15:33.348
How much for the phone calls?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.891
Oh, it's nothing.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.184
Thank you.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.073
Who is it?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.574
Me.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.660
Who's "me"?

16:38.915 --> 16:40.415
Miss Hayworth?
Yes.

16:40.541 --> 16:42.709
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm
sorry to bother you, but...

16:42.794 --> 16:43.835
Yes?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.281
The man at
the post office sent me.

16:45.296 --> 16:47.339
He said you could tell me the
name of the little Brenner girl.

16:47.423 --> 16:48.423
Cathy?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.175
The one who lives in the
white house across the bay?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.510
That's the one.
Cathy Brenner.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.845
He seemed sure it was
either Alice or Lois.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.305
Which is why the mail
never gets delivered

16:55.390 --> 16:57.140
to the right place in this town.

16:57.225 --> 16:58.225
I'm sorry. Smoke?

16:58.267 --> 16:59.434
Thank you.

17:01.020 --> 17:05.398
Did you want to see
Cathy about something?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.608
Well, not exactly.

17:09.654 --> 17:10.695
Oh.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.449
Are you a friend of Mitch's?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.493
No, not really.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.642
You know, I've been wanting a
cigarette for the last 20 minutes.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.959
I just couldn't convince
myself to stop.

17:24.042 --> 17:26.377
This tilling of the soil can
become compulsive, you know.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.878
It's a very pretty garden.

17:27.964 --> 17:31.508
Oh, thank you. Well, it's something
to do in your spare time.

17:31.592 --> 17:34.845
There's a lot of spare
time in Bodega Bay.

17:34.929 --> 17:38.014
Are you planning
on staying long?

17:38.099 --> 17:39.891
No, just a few hours.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.936
Then you're leaving
after you see Cathy?

17:43.020 --> 17:45.063
Well, something like that.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.399
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to sound so mysterious.

17:47.483 --> 17:50.110
Actually, it's
none of my business.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.446
Well, I better be on my way.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.490
Thank you very much.
Not at all.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.038
Did you drive up from San
Francisco by the coast road?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.331
Yes.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.583
Nice drive.

18:04.667 --> 18:05.834
It's very beautiful.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.044
Is that where you met Mitch?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.214
Yes.

18:13.718 --> 18:15.469
I guess that's where
everyone meets Mitch.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.138
Now you sound a bit
mysterious, Miss Hayworth.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.224
Do I?

18:21.309 --> 18:24.436
I don't mean to. Actually, I'm
an open book, I'm afraid.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.314
Or, rather, a closed one.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.151
Oh, pretty.
What are they?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.402
Lovebirds.

18:33.988 --> 18:37.199
I see.
Good luck, Miss Daniels.

18:37.283 --> 18:41.495
Thank you.
Can I get out this way?

18:42.663 --> 18:44.498
Go right around. It'll take
you back to the main road.

18:44.582 --> 18:45.916
Thank you.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.230
Do you have a boat
for Miss Daniels?

20:07.290 --> 20:08.748
Yes, ma'am.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.126
It's the one right below.

25:41.415 --> 25:43.166
Are you all right?
Yes, I think so.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.543
What do you suppose
made it do that?

25:45.628 --> 25:46.836
That's the damnedest
thing I ever saw.

25:46.921 --> 25:49.214
I don't know. It seemed to swoop
down at you deliberately.

25:49.298 --> 25:50.340
Oh, you're bleeding, too.

25:50.424 --> 25:53.343
Let's take care
of that. Okay?

25:53.427 --> 25:55.011
That's a girl.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.519
Come on.

26:06.649 --> 26:08.858
What happened, Mitch?

26:08.943 --> 26:10.693
Gull hit her.
A gull?

26:15.199 --> 26:17.158
Let's try up at the
restaurant, all right?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.579
Might need a tetanus shot.

26:21.664 --> 26:24.791
I had a booster before
I went abroad last May.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.027
What happened?

26:53.112 --> 26:55.071
Hello, Deke.
Young lady cut herself.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.406
Shall I call a doctor?

26:56.490 --> 26:59.200
No, I don't think it's that serious.
Let's see.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.869
Helen, get some cotton
and antiseptic.

27:02.997 --> 27:05.832
You cut yourself outside, miss?

27:05.916 --> 27:08.334
Don't worry, Deke.
She did it in a boat.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.420
Well, I had a man trip and
fall in the parking lot once.

27:10.504 --> 27:11.984
Sued me before
I could bat an eyelash.

27:12.006 --> 27:13.381
I don't think Miss Daniels
is gonna sue anybody.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.091
Here.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.634
Well, you're the lawyer.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.719
Thank you.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.221
What's that?

27:20.306 --> 27:21.639
Just some peroxide.

27:21.724 --> 27:23.975
I'll clean out the cut.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.521
So you're a lawyer.

27:28.605 --> 27:29.772
That's right.

27:29.857 --> 27:31.777
Of course, I usually defend
people, Miss Daniels,

27:31.859 --> 27:33.151
but if I were prosecuting...

27:33.235 --> 27:34.277
Do you practice here?

27:34.361 --> 27:36.988
Uh-uh. San Francisco.
What are you doing up here?

27:37.072 --> 27:38.406
What kind of law?

27:38.490 --> 27:39.782
Criminal.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.201
Is that why you want
to see everyone behind bars?

27:42.286 --> 27:43.870
Oh, not everyone, Miss Daniels.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.080
Only violators
and practical jokers.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.540
That's right.

27:47.624 --> 27:49.042
Ow!
Oh, sorry.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.544
What are you doing up here?

27:51.628 --> 27:53.963
Didn't you see the lovebirds?

27:55.674 --> 27:58.593
Oh, you mean, you came all this
way to bring me those birds?

27:59.386 --> 28:00.678
To bring your
sister those birds.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.388
You said it was her birthday.

28:02.473 --> 28:03.931
Besides, I was coming up anyway.

28:05.267 --> 28:06.517
What for?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.687
To see a friend
of mine. Careful.

28:09.772 --> 28:13.816
Oh, sorry.
Who's your friend?

28:15.194 --> 28:17.695
Annie Hayworth,
the schoolteacher.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.322
Annie Hayworth.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.658
Well, small world.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.702
Yes.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.581
How do you know Annie?

28:28.665 --> 28:32.668
We went to school
together, college.

28:32.753 --> 28:37.298
Did you? Imagine that. How
long are you staying up here?

28:38.884 --> 28:39.967
The weekend.

28:41.553 --> 28:45.139
Well, I think the bleeding's almost
stopped. Why don't you hold that on?

28:54.233 --> 28:55.513
So you came up
to see Annie, huh?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.402
Yes.

28:57.486 --> 28:58.694
I think you came up to see me.

28:58.779 --> 29:01.531
Now, why would I want
to see you of all people?

29:01.615 --> 29:04.242
I don't know, but you must've
gone to a lot of trouble

29:04.326 --> 29:06.369
to find out who I was
and where I lived.

29:06.453 --> 29:09.372
It was no trouble at all. I simply
called my father's newspaper.

29:09.456 --> 29:13.126
Besides, I was coming up anyway.
I've already told you that.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.293
You really like me, huh?

29:14.378 --> 29:16.170
I loathe you.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.882
You have no manners. You're
arrogant, and conceited, and...

29:19.967 --> 29:23.136
I wrote you a letter about it,
in fact, but I tore it up.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.303
What did it say?

29:24.388 --> 29:26.389
None of your business.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.308
I can't say I like your
seagulls much, either.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.435
I come all the way up here to...

29:30.519 --> 29:32.080
But you were coming
up anyway, remember?

29:37.234 --> 29:38.568
Mitch?

29:39.403 --> 29:41.737
I thought I saw your car.
What are you doing in town?

29:41.822 --> 29:43.239
I had to acknowledge a delivery.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.407
Of what?

29:44.491 --> 29:47.577
Mother, I'd like you to meet Melanie
Daniels. Miss Daniels, my mother.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.036
How do you do?

29:50.330 --> 29:53.458
How do you do, Miss Daniels?
Acknowledge a what?

29:53.542 --> 29:56.919
A delivery. Miss Daniels brought
us some birds from San Francisco.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.589
For Cathy for her birthday.
Where is she?

29:59.673 --> 30:01.174
Across at Brinkmeyer's.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.551
As a matter of fact, Miss Daniels
is staying up here for the weekend,

30:03.635 --> 30:06.220
so I've already invited
her for dinner tonight.

30:10.100 --> 30:12.310
Well, you did go to the trouble
of bringing those birds.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.020
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

30:14.104 --> 30:15.730
You did say birds?

30:15.814 --> 30:18.107
Yes, lovebirds.

30:18.859 --> 30:20.193
Oh, I see.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.781
So we couldn't let you get away

30:25.866 --> 30:27.386
without thanking you
in some small way.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.690
And you haven't met Cathy, and
you are staying the weekend.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.786
Well, yes, but...

30:30.871 --> 30:32.121
Well, you are, aren't you?

30:32.206 --> 30:33.331
Certainly, but...

30:33.415 --> 30:34.457
Then it's all settled.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.167
What time is dinner, Mother?

30:36.251 --> 30:37.668
7:00, the same as usual.

30:37.753 --> 30:39.337
I'll pick you up.
Where are you staying?

30:39.421 --> 30:40.713
With Annie, of course.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.800
Oh, of course. How stupid of me. 6:45?

30:44.885 --> 30:47.637
Annie may have made other plans.
I'll have to see.

30:48.430 --> 30:50.223
Besides, I can find my own way.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.347
You're sure now? You won't
hire a boat or anything?

30:52.809 --> 30:53.851
I'm sure.

30:53.936 --> 30:54.936
7:00, then.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.771
Maybe.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.149
We'll be waiting for you.
How's your head?

31:00.234 --> 31:02.193
Much better, thank you.

31:02.277 --> 31:05.363
A gull hit me,
Mrs. Brenner, that's all.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.920
Oh, hi. Did you
find her all right?

31:21.004 --> 31:22.547
Yes, I did.

31:22.631 --> 31:24.882
I was wondering...

31:24.967 --> 31:26.384
That sign there.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.430
Do you suppose I could have the
room for just a single night?

31:31.515 --> 31:33.435
I was planning on renting
it for a longer time...

31:33.475 --> 31:34.517
I would appreciate it.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.644
I've tried everywhere in town.
They're all full.

31:37.980 --> 31:41.148
Well, all right. Got
your bags in the car?

31:42.442 --> 31:45.444
Well, it's utilitarian, I'll say that.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.447
I just picked up some things for
the night at the general store.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.373
You see, I hadn't planned
on staying very long.

31:51.660 --> 31:55.454
Yes, I know. Did something
unexpected come up?

31:57.040 --> 32:00.376
Yes. May I use your phone?
I'd like to call home.

32:01.336 --> 32:03.671
I just put some
coffee on the stove.

32:05.632 --> 32:07.925
Don't they ever stop migrating?

33:04.149 --> 33:08.486
Hi!

33:09.780 --> 33:10.821
Miss Daniels?

33:10.906 --> 33:11.989
Yes.

33:13.325 --> 33:15.493
Oh, they're beautiful!

33:15.577 --> 33:18.537
They're just what I wanted.
Is there a man and a woman?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.165
I can't tell which is which.

33:21.249 --> 33:22.583
Well, I suppose so.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.168
Hello there. Annie had no plans, huh?

33:24.252 --> 33:25.252
No.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.257
Fine. We're very glad you could come.
You hungry?

33:27.339 --> 33:29.590
Reasonably. Dinner's
just about ready.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.716
We've been out back
looking at the chickens.

33:30.801 --> 33:32.009
Something seems to
be wrong with them.

33:32.094 --> 33:34.014
There's nothing wrong with
those chickens, Mitch.

33:34.096 --> 33:35.680
I'm going to call Fred
Brinkmeyer right now.

33:35.764 --> 33:36.804
What good's that gonna do?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.766
The chickens won't eat.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.185
He sold the feed
to me, didn't he?

33:41.269 --> 33:43.312
Caveat emptor, Mother.
"Let the buyer beware."

33:43.397 --> 33:44.897
Whose side are you on?

33:44.981 --> 33:46.524
Merely quoting the law, dear.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.275
Never mind the law.

33:55.617 --> 33:59.662
This won't take long, Miss...
Hello, Fred? Lydia Brenner.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.539
I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I?
How about a drink?

34:01.623 --> 34:02.665
Thank you, I'd love one.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.960
Fred, that feed you
sold me is no good.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.837
The chicken feed.

34:07.921 --> 34:11.297
Well, it's just no good.
The chickens won't eat it.

34:11.550 --> 34:13.634
They're always hungry.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.136
I opened a sack for
them when I got home,

34:15.219 --> 34:16.554
and they just wouldn't touch it.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.889
You know chickens as well as I
do, and when they won't eat,

34:18.974 --> 34:22.226
there's something wrong with what
they're being fed. That's all.

34:22.310 --> 34:24.978
No, they're not fussy chickens.

34:26.313 --> 34:29.483
Who? What's he
got to do with it?

34:29.568 --> 34:30.735
Is that your father?

34:30.819 --> 34:32.319
Mmm-hmm.
Please sit down.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.322
Fred, I don't care how many
sacks of feed you sold him.

34:35.407 --> 34:36.657
My chicken...

34:38.452 --> 34:40.327
Oh, I see.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.414
Dan Fawcett.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.123
This afternoon?

34:45.208 --> 34:48.252
Well, that just proves what I'm saying!
The feed you sold us...

34:50.464 --> 34:51.505
Oh.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.261
Well, maybe I'd better
go over and see him.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.222
You don't think there's
something going around, do you?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.683
No, never!

35:03.769 --> 35:07.354
No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all.
They just won't eat.

35:08.356 --> 35:09.523
Uh-huh.

35:11.610 --> 35:15.362
Well, I'll try to go over and see him.
Maybe he...

35:16.323 --> 35:17.531
Uh-huh.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.075
All right. Thanks.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.457
He had a call from Dan
Fawcett a while ago.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.459
His chickens won't eat either.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.962
It's what you said, Mom. Mr.
Brinkmeyer's feed is no good.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.716
No, Cathy. He sold Mr.
Fawcett a different brand.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.552
You don't think they're
getting sick, do you, Mitch?

35:45.185 --> 35:48.103
I still don't understand how
you knew I wanted lovebirds.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.980
Your brother told me.

35:50.065 --> 35:53.901
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco?
Is that right?

35:53.985 --> 35:55.986
No, not exactly.

35:56.071 --> 35:58.989
Mitch knows a lot of
people in San Francisco.

35:59.074 --> 36:00.908
Of course, they're mostly hoods.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.535
Cathy!

36:02.619 --> 36:04.912
Well, Mom, he's the
first to admit it.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.666
He spends half his day in the detention
cells at the Hall of Justice.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.044
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone
is entitled to a fair trial.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.337
Your brother's practice...

36:13.421 --> 36:14.880
Oh, Mom, please!

36:14.965 --> 36:18.175
I know all that democracy jazz.
They're still hoods.

36:20.804 --> 36:24.473
He has a client now who shot his
wife in the head six times.

36:24.558 --> 36:27.643
Six times!
Can you imagine it?

36:27.727 --> 36:31.772
I mean, even twice would be
overdoing it, don't you think?

36:32.482 --> 36:33.482
Why did he shoot her?

36:33.567 --> 36:35.359
He was watching a ball
game on television.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.569
What?

36:36.653 --> 36:38.445
His wife changed the channel.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.533
Are you coming to
my party tomorrow?

36:42.617 --> 36:43.868
I don't think so.

36:43.952 --> 36:46.412
I have to get back
to San Francisco.

36:47.497 --> 36:48.497
Don't you like us?

36:48.582 --> 36:50.958
Oh, darling, of course I do.

36:51.042 --> 36:52.626
Don't you like Bodega Bay?

36:52.711 --> 36:53.878
I don't know yet.

36:53.962 --> 36:57.464
Mitch likes it very much. He comes
up every weekend, you know,

36:57.549 --> 37:00.467
even though he has his own
apartment in the city.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.888
He says San Francisco's like an
anthill at the foot of a bridge.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.473
I suppose it does get
a little hectic at times.

37:07.225 --> 37:10.853
Well, if you do decide to come,
don't say I told you about it.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.105
It's supposed to
be a surprise party.

37:13.189 --> 37:16.317
You see, they've got this whole
complicated thing figured out,

37:16.401 --> 37:18.819
where I'm going over to
Michele's for the afternoon,

37:18.904 --> 37:20.821
and Michele's mother will say
that she has a headache.

37:20.906 --> 37:22.990
Would I mind very much
if she took me home?

37:23.074 --> 37:26.118
Then when I get home here,
all the kids will jump out!

37:28.997 --> 37:32.124
Oh, won't you come?
Won't you please come?

37:34.961 --> 37:36.921
I don't think so.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.008
She's a charming girl,
isn't she, Mitch?

37:41.092 --> 37:42.718
Hmm? Yes.

37:42.802 --> 37:43.928
Certainly pretty.

37:44.012 --> 37:45.137
Mmm-hmm.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.430
How long have you known her?

37:46.514 --> 37:49.266
Now, I told you, dear,
we met yesterday.

37:49.351 --> 37:51.518
In a bird shop.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.520
She was selling birds?

37:54.022 --> 37:57.816
No, no. I just led her into believing
that I believed she was, and then...

37:57.901 --> 37:59.181
Well, it's all very complicated.

37:59.194 --> 38:00.527
But she did buy the lovebirds,

38:00.612 --> 38:02.196
and then drove all
the way out here.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.781
Mother.
Yes?

38:03.865 --> 38:05.616
Where did you go to law school?

38:07.744 --> 38:09.244
Forgive me.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.873
I suppose I'm just naturally
curious about a girl like that.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.792
She's very rich, isn't she?

38:14.876 --> 38:16.126
Yeah, I suppose so.

38:16.211 --> 38:18.462
Her father's part owner of one of the
big newspapers in San Francisco.

38:18.546 --> 38:21.674
You'd think he could manage
to keep her name out of print.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.842
She's always mentioned
in the columns, Mitch.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.678
Yes, I know.

38:25.762 --> 38:29.264
She is the one who jumped into a
fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?

38:30.725 --> 38:31.934
Yes.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.228
I supposed
I'm old-fashioned.

38:34.312 --> 38:37.314
I know it was supposed to
be very warm there, but...

38:37.399 --> 38:39.900
Well, actually, the newspapers
said she was naked.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.860
Yes, I know, dear.

38:41.945 --> 38:43.362
Of course,
it's none of my business,

38:43.446 --> 38:44.780
but when you bring
a girl like that...

38:44.864 --> 38:46.031
Darling?

38:46.116 --> 38:47.116
Yes?

38:47.200 --> 38:50.869
I think I can handle
Melanie Daniels by myself.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.915
Well, as long as you know
what you want, Mitch.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.919
I know exactly what I want.

39:04.217 --> 39:05.676
Be able to find your
way back all right?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.636
Oh, yes.

39:09.806 --> 39:11.015
Will I be seeing you again?

39:11.099 --> 39:13.225
San Francisco's
a long way from here.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.852
I'm in San Francisco
five days a week

39:14.936 --> 39:15.978
with a lot of time on my hands.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.062
I'd like to see you.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.606
Maybe we could go
swimming or something.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.275
Mother tells me
you like to swim.

39:22.277 --> 39:23.861
How does Mother know
what I like to do?

39:23.945 --> 39:26.071
I guess we read
the same gossip column.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.532
Oh, that. Rome.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.451
Yeah, I really like to swim. I think
we might get along very well.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.870
In case you're interested, I
was pushed into that fountain.

39:32.954 --> 39:34.204
Without any clothes on?

39:34.289 --> 39:37.207
With all my clothes on. The
newspaper that ran that story

39:37.292 --> 39:38.972
happens to be a rival
of my father's paper.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.122
You were just a poor, innocent
victim of circumstances?

39:41.129 --> 39:42.880
I'm neither poor nor innocent,

39:42.964 --> 39:44.048
but the truth of
that particular...

39:44.132 --> 39:46.550
The truth is, you're running around
with a pretty wild crowd, isn't it?

39:46.634 --> 39:48.469
Yes, that's the truth, but I
was pushed into that fountain,

39:48.553 --> 39:49.720
and that's the truth, too.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.055
Uh-huh.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.182
Do you really
know Annie Hayworth?

39:53.266 --> 39:55.684
No. At least I didn't
until I came up here.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.728
So you didn't go to
school together? No.

39:57.812 --> 39:59.271
And you didn't come up
here to see her? No!

39:59.355 --> 40:00.814
You were lying!
Yes, I was lying.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.442
What about the letter you wrote me?
Is that a lie, too?

40:03.526 --> 40:04.568
No, I wrote the letter.

40:05.487 --> 40:06.570
Well, what did it say?

40:06.654 --> 40:07.905
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner."

40:07.989 --> 40:10.074
"I think you need
these lovebirds after all."

40:10.158 --> 40:11.658
"They may help
your personality."

40:11.743 --> 40:13.827
That's what it said.
But you tore it up?

40:13.912 --> 40:15.120
Yes.
Why?

40:15.830 --> 40:18.040
Because it seemed
stupid and foolish.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.564
Like jumping into
a fountain in Rome.

40:19.584 --> 40:20.626
I told you what happened!

40:20.710 --> 40:21.794
You don't expect me to
believe that, do you?

40:21.878 --> 40:23.921
Oh, I don't give a damn
what you believe!

40:24.756 --> 40:26.465
I'd still like to see you.
Why?

40:26.549 --> 40:28.050
I think it might be fun.

40:28.134 --> 40:31.512
That might've been good enough in
Rome, but it's not good enough now.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.097
It is for me.
Well, not for me.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.264
What do you want?

40:34.349 --> 40:35.557
I thought you knew.

40:35.642 --> 40:40.104
I want to go through life jumping
into fountains naked. Good night.

41:01.251 --> 41:02.793
Miss Daniels, is that you?

41:02.877 --> 41:04.002
Yes.

41:04.087 --> 41:05.295
Hi.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.800
Is something wrong? Is that
cut beginning to bother you?

41:09.884 --> 41:12.177
No, it's not the cut
that's bothering me.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.763
Would you like some brandy?

41:16.057 --> 41:17.516
If you have some, I'd love it.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.102
I'll get it. Why don't you
sit down, Miss Daniels?

41:20.186 --> 41:23.230
Oh, would you like a sweater
or something, a quilt?

41:23.314 --> 41:25.566
No. No, thank you.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.195
Won't you call me Melanie?

41:30.280 --> 41:31.488
All right.

41:39.873 --> 41:41.165
Thank you.

41:41.249 --> 41:43.125
Gets a bit chilly here
at night sometimes,

41:43.209 --> 41:45.460
especially if you're
over near the bay.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.756
Well, how did your evening go?

41:51.342 --> 41:53.594
Did you meet Lydia?

41:54.721 --> 41:56.597
Or would you rather
I changed the subject?

41:57.223 --> 41:58.724
I think so.

42:00.602 --> 42:02.603
Well, how do you
like our little hamlet?

42:03.605 --> 42:05.189
I despise it.

42:06.608 --> 42:09.526
Well, I suppose it doesn't offer
much to the casual visitor,

42:09.611 --> 42:12.613
unless you're thrilled by a
collection of shacks on a hillside.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.865
It takes a bit of
getting used to.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.533
Where are you from
originally, Annie?

42:16.618 --> 42:17.868
San Francisco.

42:17.952 --> 42:20.078
How did you happen
to come up here?

42:22.498 --> 42:27.127
A friend invited me up for
a weekend a long time ago.

42:28.963 --> 42:31.048
Look, I see no reason
for being coy about this.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.133
It was Mitch Brenner.
I guess you knew that anyway.

42:33.218 --> 42:34.801
I suspected as much.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.055
Well, you needn't worry.

42:38.139 --> 42:40.265
It's been over and done
with a long time ago.

42:40.934 --> 42:43.644
Annie, there's nothing
between Mr. Brenner and me.

42:43.728 --> 42:45.187
Isn't there?

42:46.356 --> 42:47.898
Well, maybe there isn't.

42:47.982 --> 42:50.651
Maybe there's never been anything
between Mitch and any girl.

42:51.736 --> 42:53.570
What do you mean?

42:53.655 --> 42:56.740
I think I'll have some of that.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.576
I was seeing a lot of him
in San Francisco.

42:59.661 --> 43:01.912
Then one weekend, he invited
me up to meet Lydia.

43:01.996 --> 43:03.455
When was this?

43:03.539 --> 43:07.251
Oh, four years ago, shortly
after his father died.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.420
Of course, things
may be different now.

43:10.505 --> 43:11.588
Different?

43:12.966 --> 43:14.383
With Lydia.

43:15.176 --> 43:17.219
Did she seem a trifle distant?

43:17.303 --> 43:18.512
A trifle.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.848
Well, then perhaps things
aren't quite so different.

43:22.976 --> 43:25.435
You know, her attitude
nearly drove me crazy.

43:25.520 --> 43:27.104
When I got back
to San Francisco,

43:27.188 --> 43:30.068
I spent days trying to figure out
exactly what I'd done to displease her.

43:30.650 --> 43:31.692
Well, what had you done?

43:32.735 --> 43:33.944
Nothing.

43:34.028 --> 43:38.740
I simply existed. So what's the answer?
A jealous woman, right?

43:38.825 --> 43:40.784
A clinging, possessive mother?

43:40.868 --> 43:42.244
Wrong.

43:42.328 --> 43:43.704
With all due respect to Oedipus,

43:43.788 --> 43:44.871
I don't think that was the case.

43:44.956 --> 43:46.581
Then what was it?

43:48.334 --> 43:51.044
Lydia liked me.
That's the strange part.

43:51.796 --> 43:54.047
Now that I'm no longer a threat,
we're very good friends.

43:54.132 --> 43:56.049
Then why did she object to you?

43:57.427 --> 43:58.552
Because she was afraid.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.512
Afraid you'd take Mitch?

44:01.431 --> 44:02.931
Afraid I'd give Mitch.

44:03.141 --> 44:04.766
I don't understand.

44:04.851 --> 44:06.310
Afraid of any woman
who would give Mitch

44:06.394 --> 44:09.104
the one thing
Lydia can give him, love.

44:09.188 --> 44:11.732
That adds up to a jealous,
possessive woman.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.860
No, I don't think so.

44:14.944 --> 44:18.113
You see, she's not afraid
of losing Mitch.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.490
She's only afraid
of being abandoned.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.909
Someone ought to tell her
she'd be gaining a daughter.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.998
No. She already
has a daughter.

44:28.082 --> 44:31.793
Well, what about Mitch? Didn't he
have anything to say about this?

44:33.171 --> 44:35.756
Well, I can understand
his position.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.425
He'd just been through a lot with
Lydia after his father died.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.469
He didn't want to risk
going through it all again.

44:40.720 --> 44:42.054
Oh, I see.

44:42.138 --> 44:44.639
So it ended.
Not right then, of course.

44:44.724 --> 44:48.060
We went back to San Francisco,
saw each other now and then,

44:48.144 --> 44:49.644
but we both knew it was over.

44:49.729 --> 44:51.772
Then what are you doing
here in Bodega Bay?

44:52.815 --> 44:54.274
I wanted to be near Mitch.

44:55.276 --> 44:57.944
Oh, it was over and done
with, and I knew it, but...

44:58.029 --> 45:00.030
I still wanted to be near him.

45:00.740 --> 45:02.741
You see, I still like him
a hell of a lot,

45:04.202 --> 45:07.996
and I don't want to
lose that friendship, ever.

45:17.882 --> 45:21.218
Hello.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.929
No, no, no, I wasn't asleep.

45:25.098 --> 45:27.182
Yes, just a little while ago.

45:28.267 --> 45:30.143
Sure. Hold on.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.521
It's Mitch.

45:32.605 --> 45:33.980
For you.

45:42.240 --> 45:45.575
Hello? Oh, yes,
this is Melanie.

45:46.953 --> 45:49.037
Fine, thank you.

45:49.122 --> 45:52.833
No, no trouble at all.
I simply followed the road.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.754
Well... there's no need
to apologize.

45:57.839 --> 45:59.464
I can understand.

46:01.342 --> 46:04.511
That's very kind of you.
No, I'm not angry.

46:08.057 --> 46:11.435
Well, I couldn't. I have to
get back to San Francisco.

46:13.729 --> 46:16.815
No, I wouldn't want
to disappoint Cathy, but...

46:21.237 --> 46:22.362
I see.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.950
All right.
Yes, I'll be there.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.119
Good night, Mitch.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.749
He wants me to go to Cathy's
party tomorrow afternoon.

46:34.834 --> 46:36.042
I said I would.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.170
It should be fun.

46:38.880 --> 46:40.922
I'll be there, too, to help.

46:41.007 --> 46:43.925
Oh, it seems so pointless.

46:44.010 --> 46:47.929
Well, I think I'll go to sleep.
It's been a busy day.

46:53.227 --> 46:55.228
My luggage.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.818
That's pretty. Where'd you get that?
Brinkmeyer's?

47:01.903 --> 47:02.986
Mmm.

47:03.905 --> 47:05.405
Do you think I should go?

47:06.073 --> 47:07.657
Well, that's up to you.

47:08.493 --> 47:10.243
No, it's really up
to Lydia, isn't it?

47:12.163 --> 47:14.915
Never mind Lydia.
Do you want to go?

47:16.167 --> 47:17.209
Yes.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.085
Then go.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.754
Thank you, Annie.

47:21.255 --> 47:22.714
Oh.

47:22.798 --> 47:25.675
Wonder who that can be.

47:25.760 --> 47:27.844
Is someone there?

47:27.929 --> 47:30.180
Who is it?

47:30.264 --> 47:31.765
Look.

47:33.226 --> 47:36.770
Poor thing. Probably
lost his way in the dark.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.856
But it isn't dark, Annie.

47:40.608 --> 47:42.734
There's a full moon.

47:51.452 --> 47:54.454
Cathy, that's very good. Very good.

47:56.624 --> 47:58.917
Okay. Here we go.

48:18.563 --> 48:22.065
Attagirl. Come on.
Don't let him get you.

48:38.457 --> 48:40.417
No, I really shouldn't have any more.
I'm driving.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.586
Well, actually, I'm trying to
get you to stay for dinner.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.087
A lot of roast beef left over.

48:44.171 --> 48:47.591
No, I couldn't possibly.
I have to get back.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.134
All right.

48:49.218 --> 48:51.219
Cheers.
Cheers.

48:53.514 --> 48:55.265
Seriously, why do you
have to rush off?

48:55.349 --> 48:57.058
What's so important
in San Francisco?

48:57.143 --> 49:00.687
Well, I have to get to work
tomorrow morning, for one thing.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.439
You have a job?

49:02.523 --> 49:03.773
I have several jobs.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.442
What do you do?

49:05.526 --> 49:07.444
I do different things
on different days.

49:07.528 --> 49:08.945
Like what?

49:09.030 --> 49:10.310
Well, on Mondays and Wednesdays,

49:10.323 --> 49:12.043
I work for the Travelers'
Aid at the airport.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.116
Helping travelers?

49:14.243 --> 49:17.412
No, misdirecting them. I thought
you could read my character.

49:18.039 --> 49:21.583
On Tuesdays, I take a course in
General Semantics at Berkeley,

49:21.667 --> 49:23.752
finding new
four-letter words.

49:23.836 --> 49:26.046
That's not a job, of course...
You mean, you don't have to...

49:26.130 --> 49:28.840
And on Thursdays, I have
my meeting and lunch.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.634
In the underworld, I suppose.

49:30.718 --> 49:32.844
I shall disappoint you.

49:32.928 --> 49:35.972
We're sending a little
Korean boy through school.

49:36.057 --> 49:38.516
We actually raise money for it.

49:43.105 --> 49:45.440
You see, Rome...

49:45.524 --> 49:48.068
That entire summer,
I did nothing but...

49:50.071 --> 49:51.988
Well, it was very easy
to get lost there.

49:53.115 --> 49:55.700
So when I came back, I thought
it was time I began...

49:55.785 --> 49:58.078
Oh, I don't know,
finding something again.

50:01.957 --> 50:05.210
So, on Mondays and Thursdays,
I keep myself busy.

50:06.462 --> 50:07.462
What about Fridays?

50:07.546 --> 50:09.172
Fridays? They're free.

50:11.801 --> 50:15.595
I sometimes go to
bird shops on Fridays.

50:16.722 --> 50:18.682
I'm very glad you do.

50:19.517 --> 50:20.767
A nice, innocent, little day.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.268
Oh, yes.

50:25.815 --> 50:29.192
I have an Aunt Tessa.
Have you got an Aunt Tessa?

50:29.276 --> 50:32.195
Mine is very prim
and straight-laced.

50:32.279 --> 50:35.198
I'm giving her a mynah bird when
she comes back from Europe.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.950
Mynah birds talk, you know.

50:37.868 --> 50:39.536
Can you see
my Aunt Tessa's face,

50:39.620 --> 50:44.082
when this one tells us one or two of
the words I've picked up at Berkeley?

50:44.709 --> 50:46.668
You need
a mother's care, my child.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.131
Not my mother's.

50:52.341 --> 50:53.425
Oh, I'm sorry.

50:55.010 --> 50:56.636
What have you got
to be sorry about?

50:58.180 --> 51:00.890
My mother?
Don't waste your time.

51:00.975 --> 51:04.686
She ditched us when I was 11 and ran
off with some hotel man in the east.

51:05.396 --> 51:07.731
You know what
a mother's love is?

51:09.817 --> 51:10.984
Yes, I do.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.319
You mean it's
better to be ditched?

51:15.156 --> 51:19.993
No. I think it's better to be loved.
Don't you ever see her?

51:25.666 --> 51:27.125
I don't know where she is.

51:31.005 --> 51:34.591
Well, maybe I ought to go
join the other children.

51:40.681 --> 51:42.474
All right. Here we go. One...

51:44.852 --> 51:46.311
Two...

51:47.563 --> 51:49.147
Three...

51:50.149 --> 51:52.233
There you go.

52:01.202 --> 52:02.702
Look! Look!

52:04.038 --> 52:06.581
Hey! No touching allowed!

52:08.209 --> 52:09.709
Oh!

52:36.237 --> 52:37.798
Help me get the children
into the house.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.733
There you go.

53:21.282 --> 53:22.866
Have they gone, Mitch?

53:22.950 --> 53:24.117
I think so.

53:24.201 --> 53:25.326
Is anyone hurt?

53:25.411 --> 53:28.162
Jenny got a scratch down her
cheek, but it's nothing.

53:28.247 --> 53:30.623
That makes three times.

53:34.211 --> 53:36.713
Mitch, this isn't usual, is it?

53:36.797 --> 53:38.882
The gull when I was
in the boat yesterday,

53:38.966 --> 53:40.717
the one at Annie's
last night, and now...

53:40.801 --> 53:42.385
Last night?
What do you mean?

53:42.469 --> 53:46.890
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.
Mitch, what's happening?

53:46.974 --> 53:50.184
I don't know. Do you have
to go back to Annie's?

53:50.269 --> 53:51.769
No. I have my
things in the car.

53:51.854 --> 53:55.523
Stay and have something to eat before
you start back. I'd feel a lot better.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.140
Would you like some
mustard with that?

54:08.203 --> 54:09.871
No, thank you.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.247
Why didn't Annie
stay for dinner?

54:11.332 --> 54:12.582
Said something about going home

54:12.666 --> 54:14.208
to take a call from her
sister in the east.

54:14.293 --> 54:16.252
What's the matter with them?

54:16.337 --> 54:17.921
What's the matter
with all the birds?

54:18.005 --> 54:19.589
Where did you want this coffee?

54:19.673 --> 54:20.965
Here on the table, honey.

54:21.050 --> 54:22.759
Hurry up with yours, Mitch.

54:22.843 --> 54:25.553
I'm sure Miss Daniels
wants to be on her way.

54:25.638 --> 54:28.056
I think you ought to
stay the night, Melanie.

54:28.140 --> 54:31.100
We have an extra room
upstairs and everything.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.728
That road can be a pretty
bad one at night, too.

54:33.812 --> 54:35.021
If I go across to Santa Rosa,

54:35.105 --> 54:37.440
I'll come out on the freeway
much earlier, won't I?

54:37.524 --> 54:39.442
Yes, and the freeway
is much quicker.

54:39.526 --> 54:42.366
But she'll be hitting all the heavy
traffic going back to San Francisco.

54:42.905 --> 54:45.365
Just listen to those lovebirds.

54:47.368 --> 54:48.368
Mitch.

55:01.006 --> 55:03.883
Cover your faces!
Cover your eyes!

56:23.047 --> 56:25.214
That's a sparrow, all right.

56:25.299 --> 56:26.924
We know what it is, Al.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.885
Did you have a light
burning or something?

56:28.969 --> 56:30.249
Yes, but there
wouldn't have been

56:30.304 --> 56:32.013
that much light
going up the chimney.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.515
'Cause sometimes birds are
attracted by light, you know.

56:34.600 --> 56:35.933
Sure is a peculiar thing.

56:36.018 --> 56:38.603
Well, all right, but we've got
to do something about it!

56:38.687 --> 56:41.981
I don't think I get you, Mitch.
Do about what?

56:43.150 --> 56:45.359
Well, the birds invaded the house.

56:45.444 --> 56:47.045
What's more likely, they got in the room

56:47.112 --> 56:48.433
and was just panicked.
That's all.

56:48.447 --> 56:50.573
All right, I'll admit a bird
will panic in an enclosed room,

56:50.657 --> 56:54.494
but they didn't just get in. They
came in, right down the chimney.

56:54.578 --> 56:57.121
My wife found a bird in the
back seat of her car once.

56:57.206 --> 56:58.706
Tell him about the party.

56:58.791 --> 57:01.626
That's right. We had a party here this
afternoon for Cathy, for her birthday.

57:01.710 --> 57:02.877
How old is she?

57:02.961 --> 57:04.253
Eleven! In the middle of the party,

57:04.338 --> 57:06.923
some seagulls came
down at the children!

57:07.007 --> 57:09.467
Miss Daniels was attacked
by a gull only yesterday.

57:09.551 --> 57:12.970
Yeah. Were the kids bothering
the birds or something?

57:13.055 --> 57:15.098
'Cause if you make any kind
of a disturbance near them,

57:15.182 --> 57:16.303
they'll just come after you.

57:16.308 --> 57:20.436
Al, the children were playing a game.
Those gulls attacked.

57:20.521 --> 57:23.940
Now, Lydia, "attack" is a pretty
strong word, don't you think?

57:24.024 --> 57:26.317
I mean, birds just don't
go around attacking people

57:26.401 --> 57:28.277
without no reason.
You know what I mean?

57:28.362 --> 57:31.155
The kids probably
scared them, that's all.

57:31.240 --> 57:33.032
These birds attacked.

57:34.076 --> 57:37.787
You got quite a mess
here, I'll admit that.

57:37.871 --> 57:40.540
Maybe you ought to put some
screen on top of your chimney.

57:40.624 --> 57:41.666
You want some help cleaning up?

57:41.708 --> 57:42.834
No. I can handle it.

57:42.918 --> 57:45.044
It shouldn't be
too much of a job.

57:48.006 --> 57:50.091
I'll take Cathy up to bed.

57:51.301 --> 57:53.678
I think I should
stay, don't you?

57:53.762 --> 57:55.263
It would be nice if you could.

57:57.099 --> 57:58.224
My things are in the car.

57:58.308 --> 57:59.767
Do you want to go with me?
All right.

57:59.852 --> 58:01.144
Well, anything else I can do, Mitch?

58:01.228 --> 58:02.270
No, thanks, Al.

58:02.354 --> 58:03.354
We'll be all right.

58:03.438 --> 58:04.939
Good night, Lydia.

58:05.023 --> 58:07.650
Sure is peculiar.

58:18.245 --> 58:22.331
Mitch. Mitch. Mitch!

58:22.416 --> 58:23.541
Yes, Mother?

58:23.625 --> 58:25.710
I'm going to drop Cathy off now.

58:25.794 --> 58:28.588
I'll probably drive over
to the Fawcett farm.

58:28.714 --> 58:30.047
Okay.

59:09.546 --> 59:10.796
Morning.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.927
Good morning, George.
Is Mr. Fawcett around?

59:16.011 --> 59:17.428
I think so, ma'am.

59:17.512 --> 59:21.140
Ain't seen him this morning,
but he ought to be in there.

59:21.683 --> 59:22.975
Thanks.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.667
Dan, are you home?

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:38.069
Mother!

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:41.280
What is it, dear?
What's the matter?

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:53.778
Al Malone, the
deputy, just called.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.044
He wants me over
at the Fawcett place.

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:57.213
Some detectives from Santa
Rosa will be there.

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:58.631
Will it be all right?
Yes.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.592
I was just taking
your mother in some tea.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:06.305
Oh, be careful, please.

01:02:16.191 --> 01:02:18.109
And you be careful.

01:02:52.519 --> 01:02:53.686
Mitch?

01:02:55.063 --> 01:02:56.689
No, it's me,
Mrs. Brenner.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.315
I thought you
might like some tea.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.193
Oh. Thank you.

01:03:02.988 --> 01:03:04.238
Where's Mitch?

01:03:04.322 --> 01:03:06.657
Al Malone wanted him
out at the Fawcett farm.

01:03:06.741 --> 01:03:09.577
Why? Didn't Al
believe my story?

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.455
He was calling from the farm.

01:03:12.539 --> 01:03:13.998
Then he saw.

01:03:14.082 --> 01:03:15.291
Oh, he must have.

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.626
They sent for
the Santa Rosa police.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:20.254
What good will they do?

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:25.217
Do you think Cathy's
all right at the school?

01:03:26.595 --> 01:03:28.304
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.

01:03:31.183 --> 01:03:33.392
Do I sound very foolish to you?

01:03:33.894 --> 01:03:35.394
Oh, no.

01:03:38.899 --> 01:03:41.192
I keep seeing Dan's face.

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.611
And they have such big
windows at the school.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:45.738
All the windows are broken
in Dan's bedroom.

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.323
All the windows!

01:03:47.407 --> 01:03:49.700
Try not to think about that.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.996
I wish I were a stronger person.

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:01.462
I lost my husband four
years ago, you know.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:07.092
It's terrible how you depend on
someone else for strength, and then

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:12.097
suddenly all the strength
is gone, and you're alone.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:20.397
I'd love to be able
to relax sometime.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:23.984
I'd love to be able to sleep.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:27.947
Do you think Cathy's all right?

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.865
Annie's there.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.742
She'll be all right.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:37.706
I'm not like this,
you know? Not usually.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.543
I don't fuss and fret
about my children.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.632
When Frank died...

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:53.305
You see, he understood the children.
He really understood them.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:57.059
He had the knack of entering into their
world and becoming part of them.

01:04:57.686 --> 01:04:59.520
That's a very rare talent.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:00.688
Yes.

01:05:03.316 --> 01:05:05.943
Oh, I wish, I wish,
I wish I could be like that.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.198
I miss him.

01:05:14.202 --> 01:05:17.288
Sometimes, even now, I wake up
in the morning and I think,

01:05:18.164 --> 01:05:21.000
"I must get
Frank's breakfast."

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:25.337
And I get up, and there's a very
good reason for getting out of bed,

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.506
until, of course,

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:29.341
I remember.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.266
I miss talking to him.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.895
Cathy's a child,
of course, and Mitch...

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:47.484
Well, Mitch has his own life.

01:05:49.112 --> 01:05:50.571
I'm glad he stayed here today.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:53.407
I feel safer with him here.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.702
Would you like to rest now?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:57.953
No.

01:05:58.038 --> 01:06:00.331
No, don't go.

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:04.585
I feel as if I don't
understand you at all,

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.837
and I want so
much to understand.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:08.839
Why, Mrs. Brenner?

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:15.387
Because my son seems
to be very fond of you,

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.640
and I don't quite
know how I feel about it.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:23.562
I don't even know
if I like you or not.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:29.193
Is that so important,
your liking me?

01:06:29.277 --> 01:06:31.236
Well, yes.
I think so.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:35.032
Mitch is important to me.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.701
I want to like
whatever girl he chooses.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.038
And perhaps if you don't?

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:46.960
Well, then I don't think it'll
matter very much to anyone but me.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.630
Oh, I think it would
also matter to Mitch.

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:54.176
Mitch has always done
exactly what he wanted to do.

01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.600
But, you see,

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.770
I don't want to be left alone.

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:07.690
I don't think I could
bear to be left alone!

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:12.778
Oh, forgive me.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:15.447
This business with the
birds has upset me.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.909
I don't know what I'd do
if Mitch weren't here.

01:07:18.993 --> 01:07:22.246
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs.
Brenner?

01:07:23.331 --> 01:07:25.666
I wish I was stronger.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:31.380
Do you think she's all right?

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:33.424
Do you think she's all
right at the school?

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.468
Would you like me to go for her?

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.471
Oh, I couldn't ask it.

01:07:39.556 --> 01:07:41.265
Oh, I don't mind, really.

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:43.809
Would you?

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.561
I'd feel so much better.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:47.479
I'll go right now.

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.158
Melanie?

01:08:01.661 --> 01:08:03.579
Thanks for the tea.

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:31.564
I married my wife
in the month of June

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.777
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:38.029
I brought her home
by the light of the moon

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:41.158
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Hey, donnie-dostle-tee

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:44.286
Knickety-knackety
Rustical quality

01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:47.915
Willow-tee, wallow-tee
Now, now, now

01:08:47.999 --> 01:08:52.461
She combs her hair
but once a year

01:08:52.545 --> 01:08:55.464
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:58.841
With every stroke
She shed a tear

01:08:58.926 --> 01:09:02.095
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Hey, donnie-dostle-tee

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.390

I brought her home

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.273
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Hey, donnie-dostle-tee

Willow-tee, wallow-tee
Now, now, now

01:09:20.073 --> 01:09:24.408
She combed her hair
but once a year

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:27.453
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.791
With every stroke
She shed a tear

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:33.836
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Hey, donnie-dostle-tee

Willow-tee, wallow-tee
Now, now, now

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:44.680
She swept up her floor
but once a year

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.850
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.978
She said that brooms
were much too dear

01:09:51.062 --> 01:09:54.189
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Hey, donnie-dostle-tee

01:09:54.274 --> 01:09:57.234

Willow-tee, wallow-tee
Now, now, now

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:05.200
She churns the butter
in her dad's old boot

01:10:05.285 --> 01:10:08.078
Ristle-tee, Rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:11.248
And for a dash
She'd use her foot

01:10:11.332 --> 01:10:14.376
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee

Now, now, now

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:25.304
The butter it came out
all grizzle-y gray

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:28.015
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:31.810
The cheese it took
legs and ran away

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.521
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee

Willow-tee, wallow-tee
Now, now, now

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:44.323
She let the critter get away

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.909
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Hey, donnie-dostle-tee

01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:49.953

Willow-tee, wallow-tee
Now, now, now

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:57.628
I asked my wife
to wash the floor

01:10:57.712 --> 01:11:00.589
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:11:00.673 --> 01:11:03.759
She gave me my hat
and she showed me the door

01:11:03.843 --> 01:11:06.803
Ristle-tee, rostle-tee

I married my wife

Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:21.818
I brought her home

Ristle-tee, rostle-tee
Now, now, now

01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:51.098
All right, children. Now, please
put your song books away,

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:53.100
then stand up
alongside your desks.

01:11:53.184 --> 01:11:56.728
We'll go out for recess as
soon as everybody gets ready.

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:00.440
We are not going
into the playground

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:03.068
until everybody
has quieted down.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:12.077
Close that door. Quickly.
Please. What?

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.333
What is it?
Look.

01:12:20.962 --> 01:12:23.755
We've got to get
the children out of here.

01:12:28.428 --> 01:12:30.929
All right, children. Now, quiet.

01:12:31.014 --> 01:12:33.974
Quiet. Miss Daniels
would like to see

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.143
how we conduct ourselves
during a fire drill.

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:42.149
I would like you to show her how
quiet and obedient you can be.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:43.859
Oh, we're going
out of school now.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:45.861
Leave school?

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:47.904
We want those of you who live
nearby to go directly home.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.322
Home?

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.491
I want the rest of you to go down
the hill all the way to the hotel.

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:52.659
Now, is that clear?

01:12:52.744 --> 01:12:54.703
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:55.996
Melanie?

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:02.502
I want you to go as
quietly as possible.

01:13:02.587 --> 01:13:06.131
Do not make a sound
until I tell you to run.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.591
Then run as quickly as you can.

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:08.967
Now, does everybody understand?

01:13:09.052 --> 01:13:10.969
Yes, Miss Hayworth.

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.472
All right, John,
you lead the way.

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:51.736
Cathy! Cathy!

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:52.047
Well, Daddy, there
were hundreds of them.

01:15:52.131 --> 01:15:53.340
No, I'm not hysterical.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:56.134
I'm trying to tell you this
as calmly as I know how.

01:15:57.803 --> 01:16:00.430
All right, Daddy.
Yes, Daddy.

01:16:00.514 --> 01:16:03.725
Well, just now.
Not 15 minutes ago.

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:06.561
At the school.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:10.023
No, I don't. Just a minute.
What's the name of the school?

01:16:10.107 --> 01:16:11.650
Just the Bodega Bay School.

01:16:12.693 --> 01:16:14.569
The Bodega Bay School.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:19.241
Well, I don't know how
many children, 30 or 40.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.037
No, the birds didn't attack until the
children were outside the school.

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:25.121
Help you,
Mrs. Bundy?

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.581
I need some change,
Mr. Carter.

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:28.291
Crows, I think.

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:30.293
Well, I don't know, Daddy.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:32.629
Is there a difference between
crows and blackbirds?

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:35.257
There is very definitely
a difference, miss.

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:36.341
Thank you.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:39.094
They're different, Daddy.

01:16:40.513 --> 01:16:42.847
Well, I think these were crows.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:45.225
Well, yes.
Hundreds of them.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:47.894
Yes, they attacked the children.
Attacked them!

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.732
Well, I don't know when, but I
simply can't leave now, Daddy.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.194
All right.
Yes. Good-bye.

01:16:56.279 --> 01:17:00.073
They're both perching birds, of
course, but quite different species.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:02.659
The crow is <i>Corvus brachyrhynchos</i>,

01:17:02.743 --> 01:17:06.121
and the blackbird is
<i>Euphagus cyanocephalus</i>.

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:07.455
Thank you.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.791
You have the number
at the Fawcett farm?

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.960
Right here in this book, miss.

01:17:12.878 --> 01:17:15.297
I can't see that it makes
any difference, Mrs. Bundy.

01:17:15.381 --> 01:17:16.506
Crows or blackbirds,

01:17:16.590 --> 01:17:19.009
if the school was attacked,
that's pretty serious.

01:17:19.093 --> 01:17:21.011
I hardly think
that either species

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:24.264
would have sufficient intelligence
to launch a massed attack.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.766
Their brainpans are
not big enough to...

01:17:26.851 --> 01:17:28.518
I just came from
the school, madam.

01:17:28.602 --> 01:17:30.979
I don't know anything about
their brainpans, but...

01:17:31.063 --> 01:17:34.566
Well, I do.
I do know.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.277
Ornithology happens
to be my avocation.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:40.488
Birds are not aggressive
creatures, miss.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.198
They bring beauty
into the world.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:43.575
It is mankind, rather, who...

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:45.660
Sam! Three southern fried chicken.

01:17:45.745 --> 01:17:47.662
Baked potato on all of them.

01:17:47.747 --> 01:17:50.206
Yes, may I speak to
Mitch Brenner, please?

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:51.624
Yes, I'll wait.

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:54.669
It is mankind, rather,
who insists upon

01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:57.380
making it difficult for life
to exist upon this planet.

01:17:57.465 --> 01:17:58.506
Now, if it were
not for the birds...

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.717
Mrs. Bundy, you don't
seem to understand.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:03.887
This young lady said there
was an attack on the school.

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:06.014
Impossible!
Oh, Mitch?

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:07.182
Oh, I'm glad I caught you.

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.308
Something terrible has...

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:09.768
It's the end of the world!

01:18:10.353 --> 01:18:12.228
Two Bloody Marys, Deke.

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:13.753
What actually
happened at the school?

01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:16.274
Bunch of crows
attacked the school kids.

01:18:16.609 --> 01:18:20.111
It's the end of the world.
"Thus saith the Lord God"

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:21.654
"unto the mountains and the hills,"

01:18:21.739 --> 01:18:23.740
"and the rivers and the valleys."

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:26.493
"Behold I, even I,"

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.495
"shall bring a sword upon you,"

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:31.414
"and I will devastate your high places."

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:33.416
Ezekiel, chapter six.

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:35.835
"Woe unto them that rise
up early in the morning,"

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.462
"that they may
follow strong drink."

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:41.424
Isaiah, chapter five.
It's the end of the world.

01:18:41.509 --> 01:18:45.470
I hardly think a few birds are going
to bring about the end of the world.

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.263
These weren't a few birds.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.599
I didn't know there were
many crows in Bodega Bay

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:50.767
this time of year.

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:54.396
The crow is a permanent
resident throughout its range.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.899
In fact, during our Christmas
count, we recorded...

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.235
How many gulls did you count, Mrs.
Bundy?

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:03.488
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes?
There are several varieties.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.813
The ones who've been playing
devil with my fishing boats.

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:07.117
Have you had trouble with gulls?

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:08.743
One of my boats did, last week.

01:19:08.828 --> 01:19:11.579
This young lady was hit
by a gull only Saturday.

01:19:11.664 --> 01:19:13.748
Deke, I'm still waiting
for those Bloody Marys.

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.083
Coming right up.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:18.128
Could you ask them to lower
their voices, please?

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:19.546
They're frightening
the children.

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:22.298
A whole flock of gulls nearly
capsized one of my boats.

01:19:22.383 --> 01:19:24.300
Practically tore
the skipper's arm off.

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:25.825
You're scaring the kids.
Keep it low.

01:19:25.886 --> 01:19:26.970
All right.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:29.889
Yeah, well,
he's scaring me, too.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:32.392
Are you trying to
say that all these...

01:19:34.395 --> 01:19:36.312
Nah, that sounds
impossible, Sebastian.

01:19:36.397 --> 01:19:38.997
Deke, look, I'm just telling you
what happened to one of my boats.

01:19:39.066 --> 01:19:41.818
The gulls were after
your fish, Mr. Sholes.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:44.279
Really, let's be
logical about this.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:46.614
What were the crows
after at the school?

01:19:48.576 --> 01:19:50.743
What do you think
they were after? Miss...

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:53.663
Daniels. I think they
were after the children.

01:19:53.747 --> 01:19:55.373
For what purpose?

01:19:57.084 --> 01:19:58.084
To kill them.

01:19:58.169 --> 01:19:59.461
Why?

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:02.338
I don't know why.

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:03.756
I thought not.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:05.800
Birds have been on this
planet, Miss Daniels,

01:20:05.885 --> 01:20:09.596
since <i>Archaeopteryx</i>,
140 million years ago.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:12.724
Doesn't it seem odd that
they'd wait all that time

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:15.477
to start a war against humanity?

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:16.811
No one called it a war.

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:17.977
Scotch, light on the water.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:20.899
You and Mr. Sholes seem
to be implying as much.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.735
Who said anything about a war?
All I said, some gulls...

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.737
- Want some more coffee?
- No.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.405
...came down on
one of my boats.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.033
They could have been after the
fish, just like you said.

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:32.911
The Captain should have
shot at them. Huh?

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:36.498
Gulls are scavengers,
anyway. Most birds are.

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:39.125
Get yourselves guns and wipe
them off the face of the Earth!

01:20:40.252 --> 01:20:41.753
That would hardly be possible.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.213
Why not,
Mrs. Bundy?

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:46.674
Because there are 8,650 species

01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:49.469
of birds in the world
today, Mr. Carter.

01:20:49.553 --> 01:20:53.348
It is estimated that
5,750,000,000 birds

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.350
live in the United States alone.

01:20:55.434 --> 01:20:57.352
The five continents
of the world...

01:20:57.436 --> 01:21:00.313
Kill them all. Get rid
of the messy animals.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:03.525
...probably contain
more than 100 billion birds.

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:05.318
It's the end of the world.

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:07.320
Those gulls must have
been after the fish.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:08.571
Of course!

01:21:08.656 --> 01:21:10.240
Hurry up, children.
Finish your lunch.

01:21:10.324 --> 01:21:13.034
Are the birds
gonna eat us, Mommy?

01:21:13.118 --> 01:21:15.870
Hell, maybe we're all getting a
little carried away by this.

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:17.956
Admittedly, a few birds
did act strange,

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.290
but that's no reason
to believe that...

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.834
I keep telling you,
this isn't a few birds.

01:21:21.919 --> 01:21:23.545
These are gulls,
crows, swifts...

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:26.839
I have never known birds of different
species to flock together.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:29.425
The very concept
is unimaginable.

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:32.720
Why, if that happened,
we wouldn't have a chance!

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:35.056
How could we possibly
hope to fight them?

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.474
We couldn't, you're right.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.226
You're right,
Mrs. Bundy.

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.477
What's the matter?
Something wrong out here?

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:41.354
We're fighting a war, Sam.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:43.648
A war? Against who?

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.857
Against birds!

01:21:44.942 --> 01:21:47.235
I'm glad you all think
this is so amusing.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:48.987
You've frightened the children
half out of their wits.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:50.196
If the young lady said

01:21:50.281 --> 01:21:53.116
she saw the attack at a school,
why don't you believe her?

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:54.367
What attack? Who
attacked the school?

01:21:54.451 --> 01:21:56.119
Birds did. Crows.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.538
You're all sitting
around here debating!

01:21:58.622 --> 01:22:00.982
What do you want them to do next?
Crash through that window?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.166
Mommy!

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.960
Shh. Put on your coat.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:10.383
Why don't you all go home,
lock your doors and windows?

01:22:10.467 --> 01:22:12.135
What's the fastest
way to San Francisco?

01:22:12.219 --> 01:22:13.261
The freeway, ma'am.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:14.512
How do I find it?

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:17.015
I'm going out that way, lady.
You can follow me.

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:19.017
Well, then let's leave now.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:21.019
Haven't finished my drink yet.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:24.772
I got here as fast as I could.
Where's Cathy?

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:26.399
She's with Annie.
She's all right.

01:22:26.483 --> 01:22:28.860
Al, why aren't you over at the
school, where the attack was?

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.112
'Cause I just got back from Dan
Fawcett's place, that's why.

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:32.864
He was killed
last night by birds.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:34.157
What?

01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:36.281
Now, hold it, Mitch. You
don't know that for a fact.

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:38.369
What are the facts,
Mr. Malone?

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.830
The Santa Rosa Police
think it's a felony murder.

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.832
They think a burglar broke in,
killed him.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.043
How do you explain the dead
birds all over the floor?

01:22:45.127 --> 01:22:48.379
Santa Rosa Police figure they got
in after the old man was killed.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:51.007
Were the Santa Rosa Police
at your school today?

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.218
Are you coming?

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:55.303
Now take it easy, lady.

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:57.972
There isn't a bird
anywhere in sight!

01:22:58.057 --> 01:23:01.809
"Look at the birds of the air.
They do not sow or reap."

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:05.563
"Yet your heavenly Father
feeds them."

01:23:05.648 --> 01:23:08.441
Say, something like this happened
in Santa Cruz last year.

01:23:08.525 --> 01:23:11.235
The town was just
covered with seagulls.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.820
Will you please
finish your drink?

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:14.864
That's right, sir.
I recall it.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:17.450
A large flock of seagulls
got lost in a fog,

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:20.161
and headed into the town
where all the lights were.

01:23:20.245 --> 01:23:23.456
They made some mess, too, smashing
into buildings and everything.

01:23:23.540 --> 01:23:24.791
They always make a mess.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:28.002
The point is that no one
seemed to be upset about it.

01:23:28.087 --> 01:23:29.587
They were all gone next morning,

01:23:29.672 --> 01:23:31.506
just as though nothing
at all had happened.

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:32.590
Poor things.

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:34.842
I'm leaving!
Are you coming?

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.844
All right, all right!

01:23:39.223 --> 01:23:41.516
Well, hope you folks
figure this thing out!

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.309
It's the end of the world!

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:47.271
I better get back to the cannery.
What do I owe you, Deke?

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.065
Sebastian, hold it a minute.

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:50.525
I don't want to be
an alarmist about this...

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.026
No one ever said
you were, Mitch.

01:23:52.111 --> 01:23:53.311
I think we're in real trouble.

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.487
I don't know how
this started, or why,

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.781
but I know it's here and
we'd be crazy to ignore it.

01:23:56.865 --> 01:23:58.700
To ignore what?
The "bird war"?

01:23:58.784 --> 01:23:59.826
Yes, the "bird war."

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.830
The bird attack, plague...
Call it what you like,

01:24:01.912 --> 01:24:03.204
they're massing
out there someplace,

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:04.706
and they'll be back.
You can count on it.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:05.790
Ridiculous.

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:07.041
Come here.

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:08.543
Unless we do
something right now,

01:24:08.627 --> 01:24:10.211
unless we get Bodega Bay
on the move, they...

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.255
Look, Mitch.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.592
Even if this is true,
even if all the birds...

01:24:16.677 --> 01:24:18.219
Don't you believe it's true?

01:24:18.303 --> 01:24:20.471
No, Mitch, frankly I don't.

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:21.556
There's no reason. I...

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:23.683
Well, it's happening.
Isn't that a reason?

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:25.059
I like Bodega Bay as
well as the next man...

01:24:25.144 --> 01:24:26.227
Fine, then help me.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:28.646
You're an important man in this town.
If you help, they all will.

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:30.273
Help how? What do you want to do?

01:24:30.357 --> 01:24:32.077
Mrs. Bundy said something about Santa Cruz.

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:34.235
About seagulls
getting lost in a fog

01:24:34.319 --> 01:24:35.599
and flying in
towards the lights.

01:24:35.654 --> 01:24:36.612
We don't have fog this time of year!

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:37.905
Make our own fog!

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.948
How do you figure to do that?

01:24:39.032 --> 01:24:40.283
We can use smoke pots,
the way the Army uses them.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:41.492
Look!

01:24:46.165 --> 01:24:49.417
They're attacking again. Melanie,
you stay in here. Come on, Al!

01:24:55.716 --> 01:24:56.758
Look out!

01:25:26.747 --> 01:25:29.248
Look at the gas. That
man's lighting a cigar!

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:33.878
Hey, you! Watch out!
Don't drop that match!

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:35.254
Get out of there!

01:25:35.339 --> 01:25:37.089
Mister, run!
Watch out!

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:39.509
Look out! Look out!
Watch out!

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.184
Hey!

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:45.444
Why are they doing this?

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:49.407
They said when you got here,
the whole thing started!

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:55.746
Who are you?
What are you?

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:58.541
Where did you come from?

01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:01.919
I think you're the cause
of all this.

01:29:03.088 --> 01:29:05.464
I think you're evil! Evil!

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:10.094
Oh, God!

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:16.600
I think they're going!

01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.228
We can get Cathy at Annie's now.

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:55.389
The crows again.
Shh!

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:01.562
Come on.

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:35.513
Oh, no. Stay here.
Stay here.

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:47.108
Cathy! Where's Cathy?

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:21.183
Mitch, don't!

01:31:48.962 --> 01:31:51.839
Oh, don't leave
her there, Mitch.

01:32:54.527 --> 01:32:55.694
Come on.

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:00.991
Shh!

01:33:27.394 --> 01:33:31.021
When we got back from
taking Michele home,

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:36.151
we heard the explosion

01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:38.654
and we went outside
to see what it was.

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:43.033
All at once
the birds were everywhere!

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:47.037
All at once
she pushed me inside,

01:33:47.122 --> 01:33:49.039
and they covered her!

01:33:49.124 --> 01:33:52.710
Annie...
She pushed me inside!

01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:10.311
Give me another one, darling.

01:34:17.152 --> 01:34:19.069
How long have they
been gathering there?

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.071
Oh, about 15 minutes.

01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:27.870
Seems like a pattern,
doesn't it?

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:33.125
They strike, then disappear,
and then start massing again.

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:43.969
Doesn't look so very
different, does it?

01:34:44.054 --> 01:34:46.305
A little smoke hanging
over the town, otherwise...

01:34:48.558 --> 01:34:49.879
You want to try
your father again?

01:34:49.934 --> 01:34:52.227
No, I tried a little while ago.
The phone's dead.

01:34:52.312 --> 01:34:54.188
- Still got power, haven't we?
- Yes.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:57.858
Mitch, I'm getting something on the radio.

01:34:57.942 --> 01:34:59.276
Come on.

01:35:06.076 --> 01:35:08.327
I can't get any of
the local stations.

01:35:08.411 --> 01:35:10.371
I think this is San Francisco.

01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:13.957
<i>"...and the work of a team of
professionals." End quote.</i>

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:16.502
<i>In Bodega Bay early this
morning, a large flock of crows</i>

01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:20.047
<i>attacked a group of children who were
leaving the school during a fire drill.</i>

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:21.632
<i>One little girl was seriously injured</i>

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.634
<i>and taken to the hospital
in Santa Rosa,</i>

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:25.969
<i>but the majority of
children reached safety.</i>

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:28.430
<i>We understand there was
another attack on the town,</i>

01:35:28.515 --> 01:35:30.682
<i>but this information
is rather sketchy.</i>

01:35:30.767 --> 01:35:32.684
<i>So far, no word has come through</i>

01:35:32.769 --> 01:35:35.270
<i>to show if there have
been further attacks.</i>

01:35:35.355 --> 01:35:37.815
<i>On the national scene today,
in Washington...</i>

01:35:37.899 --> 01:35:39.900
Well, is that all?

01:35:41.486 --> 01:35:44.613
I'll have to get some more wood in.
Mustn't let this fire go out.

01:35:46.282 --> 01:35:47.783
Did you get the windows
in the attic, Mitch?

01:35:47.867 --> 01:35:48.909
Yes, I got them all, dear.

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:50.233
When do you think they'll come?

01:35:50.245 --> 01:35:51.245
I don't know.

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:53.372
If there are bigger birds, Mitch,
they'll get into the house.

01:35:53.456 --> 01:35:54.915
Well, it's just a chance
we'll have to take.

01:35:54.999 --> 01:35:55.999
Maybe we ought to leave.

01:35:56.042 --> 01:35:57.962
No, not now! Not while
they're massing out there.

01:35:58.044 --> 01:35:59.128
When?

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:00.379
We'll just see what happens.

01:36:00.463 --> 01:36:02.005
Where will we go?
I don't know.

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.298
I think we're safe
here for the time being.

01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:04.423
Let's get the wood in now.

01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:05.759
What happens when
you run out of wood?

01:36:05.844 --> 01:36:07.484
I don't know! We'll
break up the furniture.

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:08.512
You don't know!

01:36:08.596 --> 01:36:10.797
You don't know! When will you know?
When we're all dead!

01:36:11.558 --> 01:36:13.892
If only your father were here...

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:21.358
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Mitch.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.196
Make yourself some
coffee, won't you?

01:36:29.367 --> 01:36:31.493
"In assuming
the tasks of the presidency,"

01:36:31.578 --> 01:36:34.329
"I said that few
generations..."

01:36:40.211 --> 01:36:41.211
Where are they heading?

01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:43.380
Somewhere inland.

01:36:44.257 --> 01:36:45.424
Santa Rosa?

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:46.508
Maybe.

01:36:46.593 --> 01:36:48.719
Come on.
Let's get the wood.

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:29.593
Mitch? Can I bring
the lovebirds in here?

01:37:29.677 --> 01:37:30.677
No!

01:37:30.762 --> 01:37:33.013
But, Mom, they're in a cage.

01:37:33.097 --> 01:37:34.348
They're birds, aren't they?

01:37:37.393 --> 01:37:39.978
Let's leave them in the
kitchen, huh, honey?

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:32.114
Mitch, why are they
doing this, the birds?

01:38:32.198 --> 01:38:33.949
We don't know, honey.

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:36.368
Why are they trying
to kill people?

01:38:36.452 --> 01:38:38.495
I wish I could say.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:39:57.491
I'm sick, Melanie.

01:39:59.577 --> 01:40:01.286
I want to...

01:40:01.371 --> 01:40:02.871
I'll go with you.

01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:39.814
They're going.

01:45:51.595 --> 01:45:52.762
Mitch?

01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:55.445
Oh, Mitch!

01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:11.044
Get Cathy and Lydia out of here.

01:49:13.214 --> 01:49:15.924
Melanie! Melanie!

01:49:29.688 --> 01:49:30.688
Melanie!

01:50:02.179 --> 01:50:05.431
Oh, poor thing!
Poor thing!

01:50:05.516 --> 01:50:07.797
Listen, get some water, bandages,
and antiseptic. Quickly!

01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:10.103
Bandages. It's terrible.

01:50:14.108 --> 01:50:16.067
Cathy, get some brandy.

01:50:27.538 --> 01:50:30.164
No, no, no!
No, no, it's all right.

01:50:30.249 --> 01:50:32.249
No, it's all right, it's
all right, it's all right.

01:50:32.251 --> 01:50:35.295
It's all right.
It's all right. No.

01:51:03.282 --> 01:51:05.241
Cathy, get the lamp.

01:51:19.798 --> 01:51:22.300
We've got to get her to a hospital.

01:51:22.384 --> 01:51:24.104
We can't, Mitch. There's
no place we can go.

01:51:24.136 --> 01:51:25.136
There's San Francisco.

01:51:25.262 --> 01:51:26.262
We'd never make it.

01:51:26.305 --> 01:51:27.597
We have to try.

01:51:27.681 --> 01:51:29.182
We'll go by way
of Bay Hill Road.

01:51:29.266 --> 01:51:30.767
Then we don't have
to go through town.

01:51:30.851 --> 01:51:32.769
We can't stay here.
She needs help!

01:51:33.437 --> 01:51:35.688
I'm frightened.
Terribly frightened.

01:51:37.649 --> 01:51:39.400
I don't know
what's outside there.

01:51:40.778 --> 01:51:43.863
We better get started
before another attack comes.

01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:46.699
We'll take Melanie's car. That'll
be faster than the truck.

01:51:46.784 --> 01:51:48.159
Can you finish the bandaging?

01:51:48.243 --> 01:51:49.369
I'll try.

01:51:49.453 --> 01:51:50.787
All right.

01:51:57.544 --> 01:52:02.131
Mitch? See if you can get
anything on the car radio.

01:54:01.335 --> 01:54:03.878
<i>The bird attacks have subsided
for the time being.</i>

01:54:03.962 --> 01:54:05.338
<i>Bodega Bay seems to be the center,</i>

01:54:05.422 --> 01:54:07.062
<i>though there are reports of minor attacks</i>

01:54:07.132 --> 01:54:10.176
<i>on Sebastopol and a few on Santa Rosa.</i>

01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.762
<i>Bodega Bay has been
cordoned off by roadblocks.</i>

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:14.805
<i>Most of the townspeople
have managed to get out,</i>

01:54:14.890 --> 01:54:17.517
<i>but there are still some
isolated pockets of people.</i>

01:54:17.601 --> 01:54:21.187
<i>No decision has been arrived at yet
as to what the next step will be,</i>

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:24.440
<i>but there's been some discussion as
to whether the military should go in.</i>

01:54:24.525 --> 01:54:26.405
<i>It appears that the bird
attacks come in waves,</i>

01:54:26.443 --> 01:54:28.194
<i>with long intervals between.</i>

01:54:28.278 --> 01:54:31.322
<i>The reason for this
does not seem clear as yet.</i>

01:56:22.267 --> 01:56:24.310
Did you hear
anything on the radio?

01:56:24.394 --> 01:56:26.896
It's all right.
Come on.

01:57:05.394 --> 01:57:07.603
No. No!

01:57:37.092 --> 01:57:38.300
Mitch?

01:57:38.844 --> 01:57:39.927
Shh.

01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:41.804
Stay there.

01:57:49.730 --> 01:57:52.064
Can I bring the
lovebirds, Mitch?

01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:54.400
They haven't harmed anyone.

01:57:54.484 --> 01:57:56.652
All right.
Bring them.
