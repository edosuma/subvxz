WEBVTT

42:45.531 --> 42:47.499
With his superior reach

42:47.567 --> 42:49.535
and much ballyhooed punching
power,

42:49.602 --> 42:53.129
<i>Willis has been the second-best light-heavyweight
in the world over the last two years.</i>

42:53.206 --> 42:55.334
<i>Tomorrow night,
could he become the best?</i>

42:55.408 --> 42:59.504
<i>Mike Greenwey is live at Bally's
Park Place in Atlantic City. Mike?</i>

42:59.579 --> 43:01.843
-- We're out.
-- Two minutes back.

43:01.914 --> 43:04.281
<i>Mike: We're at Bally's Park Place in
Atlantic City for tomorrow night's highly...</i>

43:04.350 --> 43:06.011
-- What's this?
-- Left jab.

43:06.085 --> 43:07.382
-- What's this?
-- It's a left jab.

43:07.453 --> 43:08.682
-- Huh, what's this? -- Left
jab -- you gonna throw any?

43:08.755 --> 43:10.883
-- What's this? Oh! -- That's a
straight right, is what it is.

43:10.957 --> 43:12.584
Lulled you to sleep
with the left jab,

43:12.658 --> 43:15.059
knocked you out
with the crushing right.

43:15.928 --> 43:17.157
-- <i>[Exhales sharply]</i>
-- <i>What the hell was that?</i>

43:17.230 --> 43:18.163
It's a haymaker.

43:18.231 --> 43:20.165
-- That's a haymaker?
-- Yeah.

43:20.233 --> 43:21.132
-- I never knew that. You know why?
-- Why?

43:21.200 --> 43:22.565
'Cause no one
throws a haymaker.

43:22.635 --> 43:23.500
Steven Green does --

43:23.569 --> 43:25.003
<i>Who's Steven Green?</i>

43:25.071 --> 43:26.266
Kid who beat me up
in third grade.

43:26.339 --> 43:27.602
-- He threw a haymaker?
-- Yeah.

43:27.673 --> 43:28.606
-- Gave me a fat lip.
-- With a haymaker?

43:28.674 --> 43:29.607
Yeah.

43:29.675 --> 43:31.769
-- <i>You should have seen it coming.</i>
-- <i>He also kicked,</i>

43:31.844 --> 43:33.209
and you know there's
no defense for that.

43:33.279 --> 43:35.771
-- Dan, did you see tomorrow's
revised schedule? -- No.

43:35.848 --> 43:37.976
-- I <i>put it</i> on <i>your desk.</i>
-- <i>I'll take</i> a <i>look at it.</i>

43:38.050 --> 43:40.815
-- We're gonna prep the pre-fight coverage
at 4:00. -- I'M take a look at <i>it.</i>

43:40.887 --> 43:43.618
And we're gonna do a supplemental
rundown at 5:00. That's gonna be --

43:43.689 --> 43:44.679
-- Natalie?
-- Yeah?

43:44.757 --> 43:46.418
-- There's a schedule on my desk?
-- Yeah.

43:46.492 --> 43:47.823
-- I'll look at it.
-- <i>Thank</i> you.

43:47.894 --> 43:50.158
That girl generates
a lot of paperwork.

43:50.229 --> 43:51.560
I heard that.

43:51.631 --> 43:53.827
<i>You generate a lot of
paperwork, maybe too much.</i>

43:53.900 --> 43:55.527
-- Natalie, are we there?
-- Yeah.

43:55.601 --> 43:56.693
These guys know everything
they're supposed to know?

43:56.769 --> 43:57.930
They're gonna be hot
tomorrow night?

43:58.004 --> 43:59.836
-- <i>Sure.</i>
-- <i>I'm asking, are they ready?</i>

43:59.906 --> 44:02.102
If they're not, they only
have themselves to blame.

44:02.175 --> 44:03.939
That may be so,
but I have you to blame,

44:04.010 --> 44:05.808
-- so make sure they are in gear.
-- Yeah.

44:05.878 --> 44:07.972
-- Who knows more than we
do about boxing? -- Boxers.

44:08.047 --> 44:08.980
Besides them.

44:09.048 --> 44:09.981
<i>Boxing experts.</i>

44:10.049 --> 44:10.982
Besides them.

44:11.050 --> 44:11.983
<i>Boxing fans.</i>

44:12.051 --> 44:12.984
Besides them.

44:13.052 --> 44:13.985
No one.

44:14.053 --> 44:14.986
Damn straight.

44:15.054 --> 44:16.453
30 seconds in.

44:16.522 --> 44:17.819
-- We're gonna nail this.
-- Okay.

44:17.890 --> 44:19.984
-- We are gonna stick the landing.
-- Sound on one?

44:20.059 --> 44:21.049
-- Sound.
-- <i>Thank</i> you.

44:21.127 --> 44:22.595
-- You know why?
-- Why?

44:22.662 --> 44:26.257
'Cause we are game-day players,
like gladiators of old.

44:26.332 --> 44:27.697
<i>“</i> Okay_
<i>“</i> Ow!

44:27.767 --> 44:29.428
-- <i>What?</i>
-- <i>Eh, paper cut.</i>

44:29.502 --> 44:30.560
You all right?

44:30.636 --> 44:31.626
Yeah,
I'll play through it.

44:31.704 --> 44:32.671
Okay.

44:32.738 --> 44:34.069
I play with pain.

44:34.140 --> 44:35.733
In 3...2...

44:35.808 --> 44:37.276
We're back.

44:45.451 --> 44:46.714
Dad.

44:46.786 --> 44:48.447
Hey, Danny.

44:52.758 --> 44:54.089
Was there traffic?

44:54.160 --> 44:57.255
I took the Deegan to
the Cross Bronx. I was fine.

44:57.330 --> 44:59.025
Say, they ordered
a bunch of pizzas.

44:59.098 --> 45:00.395
Can you stay
around a little bit?

45:00.466 --> 45:02.525
-- I'm double-parked down there.
-- Okay.

45:02.602 --> 45:04.900
You know, I don't think
you've been here

45:04.971 --> 45:07.030
since we moved
into the new studio.

45:07.106 --> 45:08.301
I think I have.

45:08.374 --> 45:10.968
This one's, like, twice
as big as the old one, Dad.

45:11.043 --> 45:13.068
The old one
was like cable access.

45:13.145 --> 45:14.840
[Chuckles softly]

45:16.516 --> 45:17.711
See, all these people

45:17.783 --> 45:19.911
wouldn't normally
be working here today.

45:19.986 --> 45:22.455
This is just
for the special coverage.

45:22.522 --> 45:23.956
For what?

45:24.023 --> 45:25.013
For the fight.

45:25.091 --> 45:26.684
Dad, come on.
I told you about this.

45:26.759 --> 45:27.920
Oh, I'm sorry, Danny.

45:27.994 --> 45:30.793
It's a very big deal.
It's an expensive match,

45:30.863 --> 45:33.264
and it's the kind
of thing that put --

45:33.332 --> 45:36.029
our ratings are tracking
right now at a 4.1.

45:36.102 --> 45:38.571
That's, like,
twice our usual numbers.

45:38.638 --> 45:41.733
That's, like, 4 1/2 million
households, Dad.

45:41.807 --> 45:44.469
41/2 million isn't
that many, is it?

45:44.544 --> 45:46.842
It's a lot for cable.

45:46.913 --> 45:48.779
Don't the big shows
get about 20 million?

45:48.848 --> 45:51.078
-- Those shows aren't on cable. --
Before you said you weren't on cable.

45:51.150 --> 45:53.244
That's cable access.
That's something different.

45:56.756 --> 45:59.123
Listen, Danny,
I'm double-parked downstairs.

45:59.191 --> 46:00.818
Oh, sure.

46:00.893 --> 46:03.658
Okay, sorry, forgot.

46:03.729 --> 46:05.493
Q-kfly-

46:05.565 --> 46:09.001
These'll get you
into everything.

46:09.068 --> 46:11.298
There's a V.l.P.
pre-fight party thing

46:11.370 --> 46:14.806
I thought you might like,
and there's a post-fight party

46:14.874 --> 46:16.399
where, if you want, you can
watch me on television.

46:16.475 --> 46:18.273
-- These are ringside.
-- That's right.

46:18.344 --> 46:20.039
I don't need
to sit that close.

46:20.112 --> 46:22.046
What, are you kidding me?

46:22.114 --> 46:23.411
I like to sit
further back.

46:23.482 --> 46:25.416
-- Danny... -- Oh, Dad,
these are great seat--

46:25.484 --> 46:28.078
I don't need to go strutting around
and showing off like I'm a big shot.

46:28.154 --> 46:29.622
It's not showing off, Dad.

46:29.689 --> 46:32.124
These are the seats
they gave me, and...

46:32.191 --> 46:34.626
I'm a fairly important
person in sports tonight.

46:34.694 --> 46:37.095
Can you see if they can trade
these, if they can move them back?

46:37.163 --> 46:39.063
Oh, yeah, sure, we'll see
if we can scare somebody up

46:39.131 --> 46:41.429
who wants
to sit ringside.

46:41.500 --> 46:44.231
Danny, you don't have to
get smart-ass with me.

46:44.303 --> 46:45.862
I wasn't, Dad.

46:48.541 --> 46:51.169
Listen, thanks
for the tickets.

46:53.245 --> 46:55.737
You shouldn't wear
your hair so short.

46:55.815 --> 46:57.408
You're starting to look
a little bit gay.

46:58.484 --> 47:00.851
Well, thanks
for the fashion tip, Dad.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.684
Coming from you,
that's really something.

47:02.755 --> 47:05.520
I'm double-parked.

47:05.591 --> 47:06.922
Okay.

47:18.237 --> 47:20.672
If the fight goes
eight rounds or longer,

47:20.740 --> 47:22.139
we're fine.

47:22.208 --> 47:24.973
<i>Any less than that,
Dan and Casey have to fill.</i>

47:25.044 --> 47:26.375
So Dan and Casey fill.

47:26.445 --> 47:27.935
<i>I'm saying they can fill</i>

47:28.014 --> 47:31.279
if it goes more than eight rounds.
Under that --

47:31.350 --> 47:32.613
Under that,
they'll fill longer.

47:32.685 --> 47:34.619
You're being pretty
casual about this.

47:34.687 --> 47:36.086
I trust Dan and Casey.

47:36.155 --> 47:37.316
Okay...
[Chuckles nervously]

47:37.390 --> 47:39.324
Well, while you trust
Dan and Casey,

47:39.392 --> 47:41.053
I'll be over here
doing my job.

47:41.127 --> 47:42.356
-- Dana?
-- Mmm, <i>yes?</i>

47:42.428 --> 47:44.419
Tim Turner is sick.
He can't work tonight.

47:44.497 --> 47:45.487
-- He's sick?
-- Yeah.

47:45.564 --> 47:46.656
How sick?

47:46.732 --> 47:48.166
Sick enough that
he can't work tonight.

47:48.234 --> 47:50.066
Who's the replacement?

47:50.136 --> 47:51.865
A guy I've never heard of,
which is saying something.

47:51.937 --> 47:52.904
-- Does he have a name?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

47:52.972 --> 47:54.064
Mmm, what is it?

47:54.140 --> 47:55.608
Who cares?
I haven't heard of him.

47:55.675 --> 47:56.733
-- <i>Jeremy...</i>
-- Chuck <i>Kimmel.</i>

47:58.644 --> 48:00.669
Chuck Kimmel?

48:00.746 --> 48:02.009
[Laughing]
You're kidding.

48:02.081 --> 48:03.276
No. Who is he?

48:03.349 --> 48:04.646
The Cut Man.

48:04.717 --> 48:05.650
The Cut Man?

48:05.718 --> 48:06.981
The Cut Man.

48:07.053 --> 48:08.646
Well, he was already
in Atlantic City.

48:08.721 --> 48:10.382
I'm assuming drunk
and asleep at the slots.

48:10.456 --> 48:12.720
As a matter of fact, he was.
Who's the Cut Man?

48:12.792 --> 48:16.126
Claims he was a corner man
for Rocky Marciano.

48:16.195 --> 48:18.493
He's never met
Rocky Marciano.

48:18.564 --> 48:19.929
He gave himself
the name Cut Man.

48:19.999 --> 48:21.467
You can't give
yourself a nickname.

48:21.534 --> 48:23.161
-- Don't I know it.
-- All right, moving <i>on</i> --

48:23.235 --> 48:25.363
<i>You don't think I'd like
to be called "The Hammer"?</i>

48:25.438 --> 48:26.803
Isaac...

48:26.872 --> 48:28.840
I would, Dana. I'd like
to be called "The Hammer."

48:28.908 --> 48:29.898
You know why I'm not?

48:29.975 --> 48:31.909
You can't give yourself
a nickname.

48:31.977 --> 48:32.967
You can't give yourself
a nickname.

48:33.045 --> 48:33.944
Okay.

48:34.013 --> 48:35.412
-- Also, that one's taken.
-- That's right.

48:35.481 --> 48:36.414
Hank Aaron.

48:36.482 --> 48:38.109
The supplemental rundown.

48:38.184 --> 48:39.379
Hammerin' Hank.

48:39.452 --> 48:40.283
Yes.

48:40.352 --> 48:41.581
Nickname -- taken.

48:41.654 --> 48:42.712
You could be
another tool, Isaac.

48:42.788 --> 48:43.448
Like what?

48:43.522 --> 48:44.751
Phillips Head Screwdriver?

48:44.824 --> 48:45.757
No, I don't know.

48:45.825 --> 48:46.553
Pliers.

48:46.625 --> 48:47.592
-- <i>Natalie...</i>
-- <i>Okay!</i>

48:47.660 --> 48:49.185
<i>Tell you what</i> --

48:49.261 --> 48:50.888
why don't we stretch our legs
and do this in half an hour?

48:50.963 --> 48:53.022
-- Should I be talking to Kimmel?
-- Please.

48:53.099 --> 48:54.464
Go and make sure
Dan and Casey

48:54.533 --> 48:56.399
are doing what they're
supposed to be doing.

48:56.469 --> 48:57.732
Sure.
How about Hammer?

48:57.803 --> 48:58.702
<i>Natalie...</i>

48:58.771 --> 49:00.170
Wait, no,
that one's taken.

49:00.239 --> 49:00.899
It is.

49:00.973 --> 49:02.031
Go.

49:03.743 --> 49:05.233
<i>I'll tighten up
the rundown.</i>

49:05.311 --> 49:06.779
I'll show it to you
in an hour.

49:06.846 --> 49:08.075
-- Dana?
-- Yeah?

49:08.147 --> 49:10.309
This is a big night for us.
I need your best show.

49:10.382 --> 49:11.508
What's that mean?

49:11.584 --> 49:15.350
Whatevefis bothering you,
leave it outside.

49:17.957 --> 49:21.450
[Cheers and applause]

49:21.527 --> 49:22.756
<i>Dan: See?
Casey: Yeah.</i>

49:22.828 --> 49:24.557
<i>See how he's
taking him to the ropes?</i>

49:24.630 --> 49:26.394
And that lowers
his center of gravity?

49:26.465 --> 49:28.695
And that's important 'cause
he's giving up, like, 12 pounds.

49:28.768 --> 49:29.860
Let's talk
about that tonight.

49:29.935 --> 49:30.868
Yeah.

49:30.936 --> 49:32.199
When's your dad coming?

49:32.271 --> 49:33.670
-- My dad?
-- Yeah, when's he stopping by?

49:33.739 --> 49:34.672
Oh, he was here already.

49:34.740 --> 49:36.105
I'm sorry I missed him.

49:36.175 --> 49:37.165
He was, too.

49:37.243 --> 49:39.007
Is he psyched
about the fight?

49:39.078 --> 49:40.170
Yeah.

49:40.246 --> 49:42.510
<i>He psyched you're
covering the fight?</i>

49:42.581 --> 49:45.516
Yeah, he's a huge fight fan, so
me covering this fight's like...

49:45.584 --> 49:47.643
he can die happy now.

49:47.720 --> 49:49.154
That's great.

49:49.221 --> 49:50.188
-- Hello.
-- Hey.

49:50.256 --> 49:52.020
This you're gonna love.

49:52.091 --> 49:54.992
This is maybe the most important
piece of boxing writing ever done.

49:55.060 --> 49:57.995
What with all the important pieces
of boxing writing to choose from.

49:58.063 --> 49:59.724
The Marquess
of Queensberry rules.

49:59.799 --> 50:00.732
-- Marquee.
-- Quess.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.733
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

50:01.801 --> 50:03.360
Could be Marquez.

50:03.435 --> 50:05.301
It's Marquess. The Marquess of
Queensberry rules, written by...

50:05.371 --> 50:06.600
The Marquess
of Queensberry?

50:06.672 --> 50:08.970
No, boxing boy.
John Graham Chambers.

50:09.041 --> 50:10.668
Then why is it called the
Marquess of Queensberry rules?

50:10.743 --> 50:12.336
-- <i>It's</i> a <i>mystery.</i>
-- <i>That'll keep me up at night.</i>

50:12.411 --> 50:13.401
Read the book
before tonight.

50:13.479 --> 50:14.742
The rules of boxing.

50:14.814 --> 50:16.373
You know how many
rules there are in boxing?

50:16.448 --> 50:17.381
12.

50:17.449 --> 50:18.712
There are 12.

50:18.784 --> 50:21.151
I suppose it's not the most
complicated sport in the world.

50:21.220 --> 50:23.052
Not complicated,
but complex.

50:23.122 --> 50:25.557
You know, my father and I
used to have this thing

50:25.624 --> 50:27.058
when we watched boxing.

50:27.126 --> 50:30.528
He'd sit in his chair, and I'd
sit on the floor next to him.

50:30.596 --> 50:32.121
-- You didn't have a chair?
-- No.

50:32.198 --> 50:33.632
What about
your mom's chair?

50:33.699 --> 50:35.224
This wasn't "All in
the Family," Casey.

50:35.301 --> 50:36.860
There was a chair,
and there was a couch.

50:36.936 --> 50:38.233
Why wouldn't you sit
on the couch?

50:38.304 --> 50:39.362
I had a root beer.

50:39.438 --> 50:41.736
I had root beer,
and he had regular beer,

50:41.807 --> 50:43.741
and we both
had them in mugs.

50:43.809 --> 50:45.971
You didn't want to sit on the sofa
because you might spill the root beer.

50:46.045 --> 50:48.776
Yeah, I was little then,
and, you know, the mug was...

50:52.184 --> 50:54.380
Anyway, it's great that
you made him happy today.

50:54.453 --> 50:56.683
Yeah, he's psyched.

51:03.596 --> 51:07.032
<i>"Before beginning real work,
every man should take</i>

51:07.099 --> 51:09.966
mild doses of physic
to work on the bowels."

51:10.035 --> 51:11.400
What?

51:11.470 --> 51:13.802
That's what this says. It's from
professor Michael J. Donovan,

51:13.873 --> 51:15.568
<i>who was the third
middleweight champion</i>

51:15.641 --> 51:17.803
<i>and the first to capture
the public's imagination.</i>

51:17.877 --> 51:20.778
Later he became the boxing instructor
at the New York Athletic Club,

51:20.846 --> 51:22.473
and his essay
on fight preparation --

51:22.548 --> 51:24.312
pretty much considered
the gold standard.

51:24.383 --> 51:26.784
<i>"Before beginning real work,
every man should take</i>

51:26.852 --> 51:28.786
mild doses of physic
to work on the bowels."

51:28.854 --> 51:30.652
That's the gold standard.

51:30.723 --> 51:33.090
<i>Yeah, I thought you could work it
into the post-fight interview.</i>

51:33.158 --> 51:34.557
-- Oh, you think? -- “Champ,
that was a heartbreaking loss.

51:34.627 --> 51:37.289
"Do you think the outcome
would have been any different

51:37.363 --> 51:41.300
if, before starting, you'd taken mild
doses of physio to work on your bowels?“

51:41.367 --> 51:43.631
-- Hey, elucidate is spelled
with two I's, right? -- One.

51:43.702 --> 51:44.931
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

51:45.004 --> 51:46.096
Interesting.

51:46.171 --> 51:47.297
By the way,
no Tim Turner tonight.

51:47.373 --> 51:48.966
-- <i>Yeah? Who do we have?</i>
-- A <i>guy I've never heard of.</i>

51:49.041 --> 51:52.306
-- Chuck <i>Kimmel?</i> -- <i>Yeah, but you're
supposed to cal! him Cut Man.</i>

51:52.378 --> 51:54.176
-- <i>I'm not calling him Cut Man.</i>
-- <i>He wants to be called Cut</i> --

51:54.246 --> 51:55.771
I'm not calling him Cut Man.

51:55.848 --> 51:57.247
He trained Rocky Marciano.

51:57.316 --> 51:59.341
Yeah, and I made sweet love
to Ava Gardner in Paris.

51:59.418 --> 52:00.783
That ruins
Ava Gardner for me.

52:00.853 --> 52:03.481
-- I <i>love Ava Gardner.</i> -- <i>Casey
slept with her in France.</i>

52:03.555 --> 52:05.649
-- VVhile she was doing “Green Acres“?
-- That's Eva Gabor.

52:05.724 --> 52:07.818
-- I <i>thought they were twins.</i>
-- <i>That's Zsa Zsa Gabor.</i>

52:07.893 --> 52:08.917
Which one did you
sleep within France?

52:08.994 --> 52:09.893
-- Natalie, I actually
never -- -- Let me.

52:09.962 --> 52:11.191
Ava Gardner is dead.

52:11.263 --> 52:13.061
Eva Gabor was
on "Green Acres."

52:13.132 --> 52:14.964
Zsa Zsa Gabor
is her sister.

52:15.034 --> 52:17.560
Casey never slept
with anybody in France.

52:17.636 --> 52:19.434
Thank you. Can I talk
to you a second?

52:19.505 --> 52:20.973
-- <i>Yeah.</i>
-- <i>Here's another one.</i>

52:21.040 --> 52:22.508
<i>"When you return
to your quarters,</i>

52:22.574 --> 52:24.736
"strip in a room
free of drafts.

52:24.810 --> 52:28.144
"Let two men rub you gently
with soft Turkish towels.

52:28.213 --> 52:31.046
-- <i>Jeremy...</i> -- <i>"Then they should
rub you with coarser towels</i>

52:31.116 --> 52:34.051
to quicken the circulation
and harden the skin."

52:34.119 --> 52:35.450
-- Jeremy! -- There's a
joke to be made there.

52:35.521 --> 52:36.852
I just couldn't get
the bat off my shoulder.

52:36.922 --> 52:38.856
<i>Maybe you can work
on it outside, sweetie.</i>

52:38.924 --> 52:40.187
I'd like to talk
to Casey.

52:40.259 --> 52:44.594
Okay. Wait...no.

52:44.663 --> 52:45.789
You got the word on --

52:45.864 --> 52:48.060
-- I'm not calling him Cut Man.
-- <i>Suit</i> yourself.

52:48.133 --> 52:49.294
<i>What's on your mind?</i>

52:49.368 --> 52:50.767
You can't just
do this, Casey.

52:50.836 --> 52:52.463
If you're breaking up
with her,

52:52.538 --> 52:54.097
you have to
break up with her.

52:54.173 --> 52:55.106
-- Natalie...
-- Casey...

52:55.174 --> 52:57.302
<i>I was never
going outwith her.</i>

52:57.376 --> 52:59.071
You know what
I'm talking about.

52:59.144 --> 53:00.908
<i>No, I don't know what you're talking
about, Natalie. I honestly don't.</i>

53:00.980 --> 53:02.311
I never went outwith her,
not once,

53:02.381 --> 53:03.507
and hardly
for lack of trying,

53:03.582 --> 53:05.243
so I don't think I do need
to break up with her.

53:05.317 --> 53:08.150
And I don't think I need either one of you
telling me what's good for me anymore.

53:08.220 --> 53:09.779
So you're breaking up
with me now.

53:09.855 --> 53:10.788
[Sighs]

53:10.856 --> 53:12.585
Look, we've all behaved
ridiculously,

53:12.658 --> 53:14.422
-- <i>and I'm moving on.</i>
-- <i>Casey...</i>

53:14.493 --> 53:16.018
I've got the punch line.

53:16.762 --> 53:18.560
No.

53:18.630 --> 53:21.531
Jeremy,
let's get back to work.

53:33.045 --> 53:34.308
10 seconds live.

53:34.380 --> 53:36.314
Stand by sound
4, 5, and 6A.

53:36.382 --> 53:37.816
Show me Bally's.

53:37.883 --> 53:39.851
<i>Loading one, two,
and effects two.</i>

53:39.918 --> 53:42.319
In 3...2...

53:42.388 --> 53:44.322
Good evening!
From New York City,

53:44.390 --> 53:46.484
I'm Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall

53:46.558 --> 53:49.084
for this special
CSC presentation.

53:49.161 --> 53:51.687
Rivera, Willis,
the battle by the boardwalk.

53:51.764 --> 53:53.198
A 12-round bout

53:53.265 --> 53:55.700
for the light-heavyweight
championship of the world.

53:55.768 --> 53:58.032
Dan's talking about
the <i>entire</i> world --

53:58.103 --> 54:00.197
Asia. Everybody.

54:00.272 --> 54:02.206
We're moments
away from the bell,

54:02.274 --> 54:04.936
so let's go to Bally's Park
Place in Atlantic City

54:05.010 --> 54:06.944
where Chuck Kimmel
will be with us

54:07.012 --> 54:09.538
throughout the rest
of the evening.

54:09.615 --> 54:12.050
Chuck, you there?

54:12.117 --> 54:13.346
Chuck?

54:14.620 --> 54:15.416
[Snaps fingers] Natalie?

54:15.487 --> 54:15.976
Casey.

54:16.055 --> 54:17.113
Cut Man.

54:17.189 --> 54:18.918
Hello, Casey.

54:18.991 --> 54:20.584
I'm right here
at ringside at Bally's,

54:20.659 --> 54:23.492
where the breakfast buffet
is $3.95,

54:23.562 --> 54:25.121
the slots are loose,

54:25.197 --> 54:27.529
and the showgirls
are fan-tastic.

54:28.534 --> 54:29.763
Oh, my God.

54:29.835 --> 54:31.530
No, I've been there.
It's true.

54:31.603 --> 54:32.900
And how about a prediction?

54:32.971 --> 54:34.871
<i>Well, when it comes
to the sweet science,</i>

54:34.940 --> 54:37.204
I'm not much
on predictions, Casey,

54:37.276 --> 54:39.836
<i>but I will say this --
one of these fighters</i>

54:39.912 --> 54:42.347
is gonna win
this bout tonight,

54:42.414 --> 54:44.974
and the other
will almost surely not.

54:45.050 --> 54:46.313
Cut Man
going out on a limb.

54:46.385 --> 54:47.784
-- Hey.
-- Chuck?

54:48.420 --> 54:49.114
Casey!

54:49.188 --> 54:50.656
Cut Man?

54:50.722 --> 54:51.382
Yes, sir?

54:51.457 --> 54:52.447
How many rounds?

54:52.524 --> 54:54.049
12 rounds
in the bout, Casey.

54:54.126 --> 54:56.322
<i>Yes, I meant how many of those
do you think they're actually</i>

54:56.395 --> 54:58.261
<i>gonna have to -- h-how long's
the fight gonna be?</i>

54:58.330 --> 55:00.196
It's gonna go
the distance, Casey.

55:00.265 --> 55:01.699
You think so?

55:01.767 --> 55:03.064
-- Absolutely, Casey.
-- I'm Dan.

55:03.135 --> 55:05.001
<i>So strap yourselves in,
folks.</i>

55:05.070 --> 55:07.038
<i>We're in for the night.</i>

55:07.106 --> 55:09.541
12 rounds from here
at Bally's Park Place,

55:09.608 --> 55:12.043
just a stone's throw
down the boardwalk

55:12.111 --> 55:14.102
<i>from where
a new Miss America</i>

55:14.179 --> 55:16.614
was crowned
just a few months ago.

55:16.682 --> 55:19.049
Miss Rochester,
I believe it was.

55:19.118 --> 55:20.381
Okay, well, uh,
Rochestefis not a state,

55:20.452 --> 55:22.477
but we'll have somebody
look that up.

55:22.554 --> 55:23.646
-- I'll go.
-- Sit down.

55:23.722 --> 55:24.848
<i>Rivera's looking good.</i>

55:24.923 --> 55:26.755
-- <i>What are you looking at?</i>
-- <i>The fight.</i>

55:26.825 --> 55:28.384
The fight
hasn't started yet.

55:28.460 --> 55:29.450
I meant in his robe.

55:29.528 --> 55:30.689
-- <i>It's</i> a <i>nice robe.</i>
-- <i>It really is.</i>

55:30.762 --> 55:31.786
You want a robe
like that, pumpkin?

55:31.864 --> 55:32.524
To tell you the truth, I --

55:32.598 --> 55:34.362
Shut up about the robe.

55:34.433 --> 55:37.926
No, it's a city, Cut Man,
in Upstate New York.

55:38.003 --> 55:39.767
Contestants
in the Miss America pageant

55:39.838 --> 55:42.773
have to come from one
of the 50 states.

55:42.841 --> 55:45.776
[Laughs] VVell, I hate to correct
you on your own show, Casey,

55:45.844 --> 55:49.678
but there's 52 states
with Alaska and Rhode Island.

55:49.748 --> 55:50.943
Okay.

55:51.016 --> 55:52.984
Though I'm no college
professor, you see.

55:53.051 --> 55:55.213
That's almost hard
to believe, Cut Man.

55:55.287 --> 55:56.277
Thank you, Casey.

55:56.355 --> 55:58.187
Hey, Cut Man,

55:58.257 --> 56:01.454
you see that television
monitor under your camera?

56:01.527 --> 56:02.460
Yes, sir.

56:02.528 --> 56:04.587
I'm Dan. He's Casey.

56:04.663 --> 56:06.597
We're ringside
at Bally's Park Place,

56:06.665 --> 56:09.532
and the voice in my ear says
we're ready to go right now.

56:09.601 --> 56:11.330
Go.

56:11.403 --> 56:13.963
Is this guy drunk
or a moron?

56:14.039 --> 56:15.905
[Laughing] Like there's no
chance he could be both?

56:15.974 --> 56:16.907
Casey, what the hell
was that?

56:16.975 --> 56:18.033
We'll be fine.

56:18.110 --> 56:19.942
No, I mean, what the hell
was <i>that?</i>

56:20.012 --> 56:22.276
Hey, I wasn't the one
who picked this guy, Dana.

56:22.347 --> 56:24.782
Eight years on television,
you couldn't help him out?

56:24.850 --> 56:27.444
-- What are you talking about? --
How much time were you gonna spend

56:27.519 --> 56:28.816
on the Miss America
pageant?

56:28.887 --> 56:30.753
Dana, it was funny.
It was good television.

56:30.822 --> 56:32.916
It's fight coverage, Casey. You're
not doing Letterman right now.

56:32.991 --> 56:34.686
What the hell --

56:34.760 --> 56:36.888
I'm going in
and watching the fight.

56:36.962 --> 56:38.726
This is
an important night.

56:38.797 --> 56:39.787
Get it together.

56:39.865 --> 56:41.629
You know
she knows about --

56:41.700 --> 56:42.496
Good so far.

56:42.568 --> 56:43.729
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

56:43.802 --> 56:45.531
-- Were you watching?
-- Not really.

56:45.604 --> 56:46.969
-- You know she knows about --
-- Yeah.

56:47.039 --> 56:48.302
<i>What do you want
to do about it?</i>

56:48.373 --> 56:49.363
I want to watch the fight.

56:49.441 --> 56:51.535
All right.

56:51.610 --> 56:53.237
Miss Louisiana, by the way.

56:53.312 --> 56:54.507
You looked it up?

56:54.580 --> 56:55.570
Saw the pageant.

56:55.647 --> 56:56.614
Here we go.

56:56.682 --> 56:57.877
<i>[Bell rings]</i>

56:57.950 --> 56:59.145
<i>Let me tell you
what's gonna happen now.</i>

56:59.218 --> 56:59.980
<i>They're gonna
start out slow</i> --

57:00.052 --> 57:01.645
a touch here,
a jab there.

57:01.720 --> 57:03.984
They'll dance,
feel each other out.

57:04.056 --> 57:06.252
They'll look
in each other's eyes.

57:06.325 --> 57:08.453
The hunt is long
and requires patience.

57:08.527 --> 57:10.791
It is the unsophisticated
pugilist who comes --

57:10.862 --> 57:11.852
[Crowd roars]

57:11.930 --> 57:13.796
Oh, my God.

57:13.865 --> 57:15.833
-- <i>Get up.
Jeremy: He's down.</i>

57:15.901 --> 57:17.699
-- <i>Get up.</i> -- <i>I don't
think he's getting up.</i>

57:17.769 --> 57:19.237
Get up!

57:19.304 --> 57:20.237
Fight's over.

57:20.305 --> 57:21.739
<i>Announcer: 9, 10</i> --

57:21.807 --> 57:22.968
<i>[Bell rings]
It is over!</i>

57:23.041 --> 57:25.976
We're in the studio
in 60 seconds.

57:26.044 --> 57:28.376
-- I <i>need animation.</i>
-- <i>Stand by, all systems.</i>

57:28.447 --> 57:30.245
-- I <i>need it now.</i>
-- <i>Animati0n's up.</i>

57:30.315 --> 57:31.373
This isn't happening to me.

57:31.450 --> 57:32.940
-- Seven seconds.
-- Yes.

57:33.018 --> 57:34.952
The fight lasted
seven seconds.

57:35.020 --> 57:36.488
The fight game
is complex.

57:36.555 --> 57:37.545
The fight game sucks.

57:37.623 --> 57:38.556
What should
we talk about?

57:38.624 --> 57:39.591
What should
we talk about?

57:39.658 --> 57:40.784
The analysis.

57:40.859 --> 57:42.156
The fight lasted
seven seconds, Casey.

57:42.227 --> 57:43.626
We're gonna have to
go back to counting states.

57:43.695 --> 57:44.787
<i>Dave." 15 seconds.</i>

57:44.863 --> 57:46.729
-- How much were we blocked for here?
-- 18 minutes.

57:46.798 --> 57:48.664
-- And how much do they have to fill?
-- An hour and a half.

57:48.734 --> 57:51.226
In 3...2...

57:51.303 --> 57:53.499
Well, welcome back.

57:53.572 --> 57:55.336
Dan Rydell
alongside Casey McCall.

57:55.407 --> 57:57.671
In a match that served
as a fine example

57:57.743 --> 57:59.905
of just how good
this sport can be,

57:59.978 --> 58:02.413
Henry Rivera sent
Clayton Willis to the mat

58:02.481 --> 58:04.245
in just seven seconds
into round one.

58:04.316 --> 58:06.751
We'll break the fight down
nanosecond by nanosecond

58:06.818 --> 58:10.755
and have a word with the once
and future champ, Henry Rivera,

58:10.822 --> 58:13.257
but first we've got
Chuck Kimmel standing by live.

58:13.325 --> 58:14.315
Chuck?

58:14.393 --> 58:15.554
Danny.

58:15.627 --> 58:16.150
Cut Man.

58:16.228 --> 58:17.627
-- Casey...
-- Dan.

58:17.696 --> 58:19.357
<i>I'll just say this</i> --

58:19.431 --> 58:21.024
that was a hell of a bout.

58:21.099 --> 58:23.568
-- Yes, indeed. -- What do
you suppose happened there?

58:23.635 --> 58:25.433
First round knockout, Dan.

58:25.504 --> 58:27.871
-- What the hell's going on here?
-- Isaac...

58:27.939 --> 58:31.375
I was taking a nap. I told you to
wake me before the fight started.

58:31.443 --> 58:32.672
-- We forgot.
-- You forgot?

58:32.744 --> 58:34.303
She's not your nanny, Isaac.

58:34.379 --> 58:36.370
I've been looking forward
to this fight for a week.

58:36.448 --> 58:37.813
I like to see it
from the beginning.

58:37.883 --> 58:40.011
Uh, Jeremy, what have
I missed so far?

58:40.085 --> 58:42.679
The whole time, he was talking to you two.
Why do <i>I</i> have to answer that question?

58:42.754 --> 58:44.984
-- <i>What did</i> I <i>miss?!</i>
-- <i>You missed the fight, Isaac.</i>

58:45.057 --> 58:46.422
What are you
talking about?

58:46.491 --> 58:48.482
<i>Rivera knocked him out
in seven seconds.</i>

58:48.560 --> 58:49.618
Give me sound on four.

58:49.695 --> 58:50.890
The fight's over?

58:50.962 --> 58:51.895
Yeah.

58:51.963 --> 58:53.761
The fight's over?

58:53.832 --> 58:55.994
The fight was 7 seconds, Isaac. We're
on the air another 88 minutes.

58:56.068 --> 58:58.196
I have a hunch we're gonna be able
to replay it a couple of times.

58:58.270 --> 59:00.170
<i>Dana: Casey, ask him what
kind of punch he threw.</i>

59:00.238 --> 59:01.569
What did he throw,
Cut Man?

59:01.640 --> 59:04.871
It was a right hook
with a bit of a jab.

59:04.943 --> 59:06.536
A jabbing right hook.

59:06.611 --> 59:07.601
That's right, Casey.

59:07.679 --> 59:09.443
And he did it
with his left hand.

59:09.514 --> 59:12.006
This fighter's got
remarkable skills.

59:12.084 --> 59:13.711
<i>He's not to be
trifled with, Casey.</i>

59:13.785 --> 59:16.311
-- I thought they were supposed to
be prepared, Natalie. -- Dana...

59:16.388 --> 59:19.221
Let me see some of that homework
you're supposed to have done, Casey.

59:19.291 --> 59:21.919
Cut Man, this has to be a heartbreaking
loss for Clayton VVillis.

59:21.993 --> 59:24.121
Do you think the outcome
would have been any different

59:24.196 --> 59:26.722
if Willis had taken
mild doses of physic

59:26.798 --> 59:27.993
to work on his bowels?

59:28.066 --> 59:29.397
No doubt about it, Casey.

59:29.468 --> 59:30.401
Bowels, Jeremy?

59:30.469 --> 59:32.062
Who the hell
gave that question to Casey?

59:32.137 --> 59:34.071
-- Sit down.
-- Okay.

59:34.139 --> 59:34.970
10 seconds to commercial.

59:35.040 --> 59:35.973
Cut Man?

59:36.041 --> 59:37.031
Yes, Dan?

59:37.109 --> 59:38.440
Uh, no, it's still Casey.

59:38.510 --> 59:40.740
We're going to take
a short commercial break,

59:40.812 --> 59:43.645
after which, believe it or not, we're
gonna talk about this some more.

59:43.715 --> 59:44.978
Stay tuned.

59:45.050 --> 59:46.245
<i>Dave: We're out.
-- <i>Three minutes back.</i></i>

59:46.318 --> 59:47.649
I'm gonna kill them.

59:47.719 --> 59:48.652
<i>Isaac." Dana...</i>

59:48.720 --> 59:49.778
Let me do my job, Isaac.

59:49.855 --> 59:51.448
They're making it work.
They're having fun.

59:51.523 --> 59:52.922
They're turning this
into a joke.

59:52.991 --> 59:54.459
Where else are they
supposed to go with it?

59:54.526 --> 59:55.493
Excuse me.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.688
Can I talk to you
outside?

01:00:00.632 --> 01:00:02.760
Yes.

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:05.565
Casey, remember,
it's a good idea to get naked

01:00:05.637 --> 01:00:08.834
and have two men rub you down
with soft Turkish towels.

01:00:08.907 --> 01:00:09.999
And that's
to harden the skin?

01:00:10.075 --> 01:00:11.770
-- Yes, sir.
-- Okay.

01:00:11.843 --> 01:00:13.937
Well, you got
to figure this --

01:00:14.012 --> 01:00:16.538
at least my dad
will beat the traffic.

01:00:16.615 --> 01:00:18.083
[Both chuckle]

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:20.585
Look, your dad can't
blame you for the fight.

01:00:20.652 --> 01:00:22.552
Why not? Dana's blaming
you for the fight.

01:00:22.621 --> 01:00:23.918
That's a fair point.

01:00:23.989 --> 01:00:25.388
He wasn't psyched
at all, Casey.

01:00:25.457 --> 01:00:27.721
He doesn't care what I'm doing.
He thinks I'm a jackass.

01:00:27.793 --> 01:00:29.488
I don't think he does. I think
he just acts like he does.

01:00:29.561 --> 01:00:30.528
It doesn't
make a difference.

01:00:30.595 --> 01:00:32.586
-- Well, it should.
-- It doesn't.

01:00:32.664 --> 01:00:34.325
-- Someday it might.
-- You think?

01:00:34.399 --> 01:00:35.798
-- Yeah.
-- Soon?

01:00:35.867 --> 01:00:38.461
Actually, yeah...soon.

01:00:38.537 --> 01:00:40.027
90 seconds back.

01:00:40.105 --> 01:00:41.266
<i>Hello.</i>

01:00:41.339 --> 01:00:42.465
Hello.

01:00:42.541 --> 01:00:43.975
Can I talk to you a second?

01:00:44.042 --> 01:00:45.976
Sure.

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:55.015
Listen --

01:00:55.086 --> 01:00:56.952
Dana, we are doing
the very best we can.

01:00:57.022 --> 01:00:59.150
Now, it has nothing to do
with lack of preparation.

01:00:59.224 --> 01:01:01.249
It has everything to do
with the 7-second contest

01:01:01.326 --> 01:01:03.522
and a color man who has no
business being on the air,

01:01:03.595 --> 01:01:05.085
and whom it was
not my job to get.

01:01:05.163 --> 01:01:06.426
I'm not mad at you.

01:01:08.166 --> 01:01:09.258
Okay.

01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:11.962
You've been funny tonight.

01:01:12.037 --> 01:01:13.004
You both have.

01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:15.096
We've got
a long night to go,

01:01:15.173 --> 01:01:17.540
but you're doing great.

01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:20.510
Thank you.

01:01:20.579 --> 01:01:22.445
I stopped
being mad at you.

01:01:22.514 --> 01:01:25.643
I think you know
that the other night,

01:01:25.717 --> 01:01:27.651
I went to look for you,

01:01:27.719 --> 01:01:29.744
and Jack said that
you'd gone off with --

01:01:29.821 --> 01:01:31.346
Yeah.

01:01:31.423 --> 01:01:33.357
And I was mad at you

01:01:33.425 --> 01:01:37.692
because, well...

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:42.029
I was jealous, obviously,

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:46.367
but -- and it's not like I
hadn't taken that into account

01:01:46.438 --> 01:01:50.705
when I came up
with the brilliant plan

01:01:50.775 --> 01:01:54.712
in the first place.

01:01:54.779 --> 01:01:59.717
It was never my intention
to make you feel

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:02.219
like there was
something wrong with you

01:02:02.287 --> 01:02:04.984
that needed to be fixed.

01:02:05.056 --> 01:02:08.390
It was regrettable
that I did that.

01:02:11.263 --> 01:02:12.890
Well, the thing is,

01:02:12.964 --> 01:02:14.659
there's been 15 years
of it from you, Dana,

01:02:14.733 --> 01:02:17.668
and frankly,
from my marriage, too,

01:02:17.736 --> 01:02:21.331
and I know you don't
deserve the bill for that,

01:02:21.406 --> 01:02:23.067
but, uh...

01:02:29.781 --> 01:02:33.581
Well, I just want
to move on.

01:02:35.654 --> 01:02:37.281
Yeah.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.422
<i>Dave: 30 seconds back.</i>

01:02:41.493 --> 01:02:42.517
I gotta go back.

01:02:42.594 --> 01:02:44.426
Okay.

01:02:44.496 --> 01:02:45.827
Casey?

01:02:51.002 --> 01:02:53.232
If I were to ask
you out tonight,

01:02:53.305 --> 01:02:54.966
would you say yes?
[Chuckles nervously]

01:02:57.976 --> 01:02:59.501
No.

01:03:02.847 --> 01:03:05.111
But ask me again
another time.

01:03:10.989 --> 01:03:12.650
Okay.

01:03:19.731 --> 01:03:20.926
-- You all right?
-- Yep.

01:03:20.999 --> 01:03:22.990
-- You sure?
-- Yeah, let's have some fun.

01:03:23.068 --> 01:03:24.001
In 10.

01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:25.059
Everything all right?

01:03:25.136 --> 01:03:26.069
Yep.

01:03:26.137 --> 01:03:27.798
Are you sure?

01:03:27.872 --> 01:03:30.170
It's over.

01:03:30.241 --> 01:03:31.709
In 3...2...

01:03:31.776 --> 01:03:33.005
Welcome back.

01:03:33.078 --> 01:03:35.274
I'm Casey McCall
alongside Dan Rydell,

01:03:35.347 --> 01:03:37.907
sending out the good vibe
to his father, Jacob,

01:03:37.983 --> 01:03:40.111
who's sitting and watching his
son on television right now,

01:03:40.185 --> 01:03:41.448
whether he says so or not.

01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:44.181
We've got Chuck "The Cut Man"
Kimmel in Atlantic City,

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:46.519
and for those of you
still watching at home,

01:03:46.591 --> 01:03:48.559
please give us a call
and tell us why.

01:03:48.627 --> 01:03:51.722
<i>CSC's coverage
of the big fight continues.</i>
