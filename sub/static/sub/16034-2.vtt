WEBVTT

00:45.600 --> 00:47.579
(Waves crashing on beach)

01:26.680 --> 01:28.307
(Keys jangle in distance)

01:34.680 --> 01:36.659
(Footsteps approaching)

01:44.920 --> 01:46.899
(Voices shouting in distance)

01:48.840 --> 01:52.139
- Sounds lively out there.
- The rabble are out in force tonight.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.621
The list...

01:57.640 --> 01:59.665
..ofthose summoned to speak against you.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.539
ROSS: A long list.

02:03.440 --> 02:04.543
Jud Paynter?

02:04.720 --> 02:06.585
You know him?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.739
He was my servant.

02:10.200 --> 02:12.179
Well, now he's the Crown's.

02:13.760 --> 02:17.139
And the testimony of a loyal servant
against his former master...

02:17.320 --> 02:19.299
Nail in the coffin.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.459
(Angry shouting)

02:48.760 --> 02:50.739
(Chamber music plays)

02:59.240 --> 03:01.822
Mistress Poldark, how delightful!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.627
Mr Penvenen.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.665
To think of us meeting again so soon!

03:05.840 --> 03:08.547
And may I introduce my niece, Caroline.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.462
Mistress Demelza Poldark of Nampara.

03:11.640 --> 03:14.507
And Mr Unwin Trevaunance.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.625
Are you here for the election, ma'am?

03:16.800 --> 03:18.427
Er... No, ma'am, for the assizes.

03:18.600 --> 03:23.344
Oh, yes. Unwin, were you not telling me
there was a Poldark to be tried this week?

03:23.520 --> 03:25.067
That's my husband, ma'am.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.943
And is he guilty? What did he do?

03:29.120 --> 03:30.269
(Trevaunance clears throat)

03:30.440 --> 03:35.503
Well, ifI were the judge, I would sentence him
to be returned to his wife without delay.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.388
(Hubbub of voices)

03:38.560 --> 03:42.303
That must be the crowd, clamouring for me.
Will you join me outside?

03:42.480 --> 03:44.459
Why not? I enjoy a baying mob.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.299
May I be of service, ma'am?

03:52.120 --> 03:54.827
Well, since you mention it...

04:02.000 --> 04:03.786
Oh, for pity's sake!

04:03.960 --> 04:06.303
Must we always have these dire predictions?

04:06.480 --> 04:10.667
Not once have I known you forecast
an outcome which was remotely cheering!

04:11.760 --> 04:13.739
I'm not divining the future.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.988
I'm entertaining myselfwith a game of Snap.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.381
Go to Bodmin, Elizabeth.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.664
You'll never be satisfied till you do.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.545
This election? 'Tis a joke!

04:28.720 --> 04:31.985
What difference do it make?
Who suffers when mines close?

04:32.960 --> 04:34.302
Not fancy folk.

04:34.480 --> 04:37.904
Stuffed to t'gizzards wi' beef - while we scrape
by on black bread and beech leaves!

04:38.080 --> 04:39.468
In France, they wouldn't stand for it.

04:39.640 --> 04:43.542
It's come here to Bodmin soon enough, and it
won't be long before it reaches you in Truro.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.541
Bin out there, 'ave 'ee?
'Tis like a powder keg!

04:46.720 --> 04:48.540
Dr Enys!

04:48.720 --> 04:51.109
- What brings 'ee here?
- Same as you, Prudie.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.907
To speak for Cap'n Ross?

04:53.080 --> 04:54.786
As I'm sure we all will.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.742
Mr Paynter, are you ill?

05:00.600 --> 05:05.264
Dammit, can a man not study the innards of
a jug without bein' clepp'd malingerer?

05:06.120 --> 05:08.099
I commend you to your studies.

05:09.040 --> 05:11.702
Goin' out there? 'Ave a care.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.900
'Twill take but a spark...
(Mimics explosion)

05:21.760 --> 05:24.547
Your defence is proving more of a challenge
than I'd anticipated.

05:24.720 --> 05:26.585
Do you have the document from Harris Pascoe?

05:31.480 --> 05:33.459
Your last will and testament?

05:38.400 --> 05:40.027
Inﬂuence?

05:40.200 --> 05:42.987
I do not have that sort of influence, ma'am.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.867
And it would prejudice your husband's case,
not help it.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.385
- But if it was put the right way?
- If it were put any way, ma'am.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.107
No, no, no.

05:52.280 --> 05:55.306
I wouldn't dream oftrying to persuade a judge.

05:56.240 --> 05:58.219
Believe me, I sympathise. I really do.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.382
And I do dearly hope that the court
look kindly on your husband.

06:02.560 --> 06:09.784
But the surest way of attaining the opposite,
would be to try and influence the judge.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.059
I see.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.425
(She sighs)

06:20.600 --> 06:22.579
Forgive me, sir.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.579
I'm a little despairing.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.343
Is he...a kindly man?

06:35.520 --> 06:37.385
In appearance, I mean?

06:37.560 --> 06:39.983
Justice Lister? Somewhat severe.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.426
- Small and stout?
- Tall and lean.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.945
Does he likes his port?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.781
Resolutely sober.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.347
Ifthere's to be a reckoning,
it's as well to have one's affairs in order...

07:00.440 --> 07:02.419
..little as there is of value.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.703
My household effects,
my shares in Wheal Leisure...

07:05.880 --> 07:08.587
Mr Pascoe mentions a Wheal Grace.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.625
My father's old mine.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.665
- It's derelict.
- But still yours.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.626
And still deemed an asset.

07:14.800 --> 07:17.906
Not by me!
I deem it a worthless hole in the ground.

07:21.040 --> 07:26.945
But by all means, let me bequeath it to my wife,
along with my other debts and liabilities.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.419
(He exhales heavily)

07:43.040 --> 07:45.019
I really have left her nothing.

08:03.480 --> 08:04.583
- Excuse me...
- No.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.308
- Ouch!
- Oh, dear, madam, my deepest apologies.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.301
- Are you hurt?
- Only my dignity, sir.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.983
May I assist you to a chair?
Some port, perhaps?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.025
No, thank you.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.179
I never touch it, sir.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.339
(Low chatter)

08:29.520 --> 08:32.068
- Are you stalking me, Dr Enys?
- Not at all, ma'am.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.105
But now I'm here, may I be of service?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.339
Can you prescribe
something to keep me awake?

08:36.520 --> 08:38.943
- You find the election boring?
- Exceedingly dull.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.747
And the rabble out there insufferable.

08:40.920 --> 08:42.660
Oh, I grant you, it seems unpleasant.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.308
But take each man for himself
and he's likeable enough.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.425
Are you a Jacobin, like Ross Poldark?

08:47.600 --> 08:49.659
It's clear you don't know Ross Poldark.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.504
No, but I expect to tomorrow, and I'd hope for
better entertainment than I've had here tonight.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.304
Perhaps you're the sort
who takes a window at Tyburn

08:57.480 --> 09:00.267
for the pleasure of seeing someone
choked to death?

09:00.440 --> 09:02.385
And is it any business of yours if I am?

09:02.560 --> 09:04.425
No, I'm thankful not.

09:04.600 --> 09:09.469
MAN: Gentlemen, I have here the results
ofthe Bodmin constituency.

09:11.280 --> 09:15.580
Chenhalls, Michael: 2,250.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.182
(Cheering)

09:17.360 --> 09:22.662
Dagge, Hugh: 1 ,203.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.185
Trevaunance, Unwin: 1 ,203.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.547
It's a tie for second place!

09:31.680 --> 09:33.420
A farcical state of affairs!

09:33.600 --> 09:36.467
There'll have to be a second vote
to decide the remaining seat.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.700
There can be no question ofthat.
Regard yourself as elected and act accordingly.

09:39.880 --> 09:42.781
- But how? I'm tied in second place!
- The chair, man. Take a second chair.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.862
Claim your seat before Dagge has chance to
contest it. Come now, there's no time to lose!

09:50.400 --> 09:52.186
(Mob shouting)

10:00.000 --> 10:01.865
Who are ye?

10:02.040 --> 10:05.419
- Er...well...
- D'you know me? D'you speak for me?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.943
- I'm your elected member...
- Who elected ye?

10:08.120 --> 10:10.748
Did I? Did any here?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.899
(Angry shouts of denial)

10:13.800 --> 10:15.142
You don't speak for me!

10:15.920 --> 10:17.899
But maybe this will!

10:20.840 --> 10:22.467
Turn it round.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.619
(Angry shouting)

10:28.360 --> 10:30.339
Get me back inside!

10:32.080 --> 10:34.059
I hope he brought his rose-water!

10:37.800 --> 10:39.665
There'll be a reckoning, mark ye!

10:39.840 --> 10:41.899
Commoners don't 'old wi' bein'
tramped underfoot!

10:42.600 --> 10:45.182
Bring down the fancy folk an' let the poor rise!

10:45.880 --> 10:49.065
Ye shan't muzzle me!
I'm a free man - I've a rIght to speak!

10:49.240 --> 10:50.707
Urgh!

10:52.880 --> 10:54.541
Apparently not.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.347
This has not helped our cause.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.745
Mission accomplished.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.104
Unwin has established his claim.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.145
Almost at the expense of his own life!

11:11.320 --> 11:13.185
Is it always like this in Bodmin?

11:13.360 --> 11:16.739
I couldn't say. I live near Truro.
I'm only here for tomorrow's trial.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.785
You speak for Ross Poldark?

11:18.960 --> 11:21.349
I look forward to seeing you acquit yourself.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.499
Happily, it's not I who is on trial.

11:24.360 --> 11:26.339
Are you quite certain ofthat?

11:29.400 --> 11:31.379
You flatter yourself, ma'am.

11:32.440 --> 11:34.260
Are all men so odiously conceited?

11:34.440 --> 11:37.147
I shouldn't put conceit
as the particular property of one sex.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.662
How gracious of you to correct me, sir!

11:38.840 --> 11:41.627
I wonder you're so solicitous
for one you so clearly despise.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.665
You're mistaken, madam.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.819
I neither solicit nor despise.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.865
That rabble!
Have they no respect for their betters?

11:52.720 --> 11:54.301
Or for the law?

11:55.160 --> 11:58.425
Someone needs to take them
by the scruff ofthe neck and...

12:01.440 --> 12:02.907
Oh, good God!

12:03.080 --> 12:04.820
What is the woman doing?

12:06.440 --> 12:08.499
She'll hang her husband if she's not careful.

12:08.680 --> 12:14.027
So let me ask Your Lordship - how can a body
judge if a person be tellin' the truth?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.383
Well...

12:15.560 --> 12:18.905
Some of 'em be so downright convincin'
and have all the evidence to back 'em up.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.504
But ifthe evidence be false?

12:23.680 --> 12:25.307
Excuse me.

12:25.480 --> 12:30.861
For instance, erm...if a body did
know the truth about an accused...

12:31.880 --> 12:35.145
..wouldn't he or she then be obliged to speak?

12:35.320 --> 12:38.187
Most assuredly,
in the appropriate place.

12:38.360 --> 12:39.543
Which would be the court.

12:39.720 --> 12:43.907
Then put the case, sir,
that a body know'd some other body

12:44.080 --> 12:47.709
who paid money so that
other bodies might speak lies.

12:47.880 --> 12:50.144
You list a great many bodies, ma'am.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.742
Are any ofthem here now?

12:51.920 --> 12:55.549
Well, in truth, seen as you do ask me directly,
Your Lordship...

12:55.720 --> 12:58.382
Mistress Demelza, what a pleasure to see you.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.619
And Your Lordship - out unusually late?

13:00.800 --> 13:02.427
Indeed, sir.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.465
Though not unagreeably detained.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.789
- Of course you will meet him tomorrow.
- Sir?

13:09.960 --> 13:12.667
Ross Poldark,
when he comes before you in court.

13:14.200 --> 13:17.021
Oh...you were not aware?

13:17.920 --> 13:19.899
No, sir, I was not.

13:22.800 --> 13:25.746
You will pardon me, ma'am, sir.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.706
Let me accompany you.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.060
What do you make ofthis assault
on our newly-elected MP?

13:34.240 --> 13:38.381
Barely escaped with his life. Ifthis goes on,
we'll have a revolution on our hands.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.868
In Cornwall?

13:40.040 --> 13:43.589
People are fearful, sir. People are wondering
when a clear message will be sent.

13:43.760 --> 13:48.345
Those who stir up disorder should expect
the severest penalty. Would you not agree?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.420
I do, sir.

13:55.760 --> 13:58.149
Beg pardon, sur, there's a gentleman within.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.787
A Mr Francis Poldark?

14:01.880 --> 14:03.108
Oh, yes.

14:07.560 --> 14:22.066
Francis?

14:32.520 --> 14:34.499
Locked, sir, from the inside.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.621
(Rattles lock)

14:44.920 --> 14:47.184
- We may need to break it down.
- Nay, 'twill damage it.

14:47.360 --> 14:49.828
Damn it, man, Mr Poldark may be ill.
He may even...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.183
(Door opens)

14:57.200 --> 14:59.304
This is the statement I've prepared for you.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.098
You may find it a little contrite for your taste.

15:08.760 --> 15:12.582
There are limits - even if one's neck is at stake.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.707
So you'd go to the gallows
on a point of principle?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.987
Of course it's your life, to do as you please.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.019
Are you a fatalist, Enys?

15:39.800 --> 15:43.702
Or do you believe that we are
masters of our own destiny?

15:45.680 --> 15:47.989
- Well...
- Because a short while ago I...

15:49.880 --> 15:52.940
..pointed this at my head and it misfired.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.022
The flint went down
but the powder did not ignite.

15:58.400 --> 16:01.779
Since then I've been trying to decide
whether to do it again.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.379
I agree, it's in very poor taste to use
your hospitality for such a purpose.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.539
But I erm...

16:13.440 --> 16:15.579
Anyway, the thing's not done, so...

16:17.920 --> 16:22.789
..for the moment, you have a talkative
companion instead of a silent one.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.739
I don't understand.

16:29.040 --> 16:30.905
Why would you wish...?

16:31.080 --> 16:36.985
Francis, you are young, propertied, respected,
you have a beautiful wife, a healthy son...

16:37.160 --> 16:38.707
Stop!

16:40.120 --> 16:42.099
Or I shall weep forjoy!

16:46.920 --> 16:48.899
Let's have some brandy, hm?

16:49.720 --> 16:52.826
At any rate, I can do no damage
until I have fresh powder.

16:55.560 --> 16:57.539
I hope you will reconsider.

17:13.000 --> 17:14.501
Here's to the devil.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.822
(Glasses clink)

17:18.000 --> 17:20.389
Lord knows whose side he's been on tonight.

17:31.160 --> 17:33.025
Why do you hate him?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.179
What has he ever done to deserve it?

17:36.880 --> 17:38.427
I doubt you'd understand.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.465
Because I am not so well-bred as you?

17:40.640 --> 17:44.508
I am a miner's daughter. But you are a
blacksmith's grandson. What is the difference?

17:44.680 --> 17:49.549
The difference is that you will always be a
miner's daughter, whereas I am a gentleman.

17:50.560 --> 17:53.825
- I am a gentleman's wife.
- Soon to be a gentleman's widow.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.827
CLYMER: Got a wife?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.586
Got a family?

18:12.240 --> 18:16.028
You don't think it's worth making
this concession for their sakes?

18:19.240 --> 18:21.219
I appreciate your efforts.

18:22.440 --> 18:24.658
But I cannot put my name
to beggary and flattery.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.819
Damn it, man, you have no choice!

18:30.080 --> 18:31.741
The case against you's too strong.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.858
It's not a question of whether
you'll be found guilty, but when.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.539
And what the sentence will be.

18:39.600 --> 18:43.707
All you can do is paint a penitent figure,
so that you may escape the worst.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.299
The worst, I tell you.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.180
Perhaps you will consider that
before you sleep tonight.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.339
(Keys jangle then turn in lock)

19:14.280 --> 19:16.259
Did you have better luck?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.779
If anything, I've made it worse.

19:21.280 --> 19:23.145
What did you hope to achieve?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.901
I don't know.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.661
Anything.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.139
Verity, I lost my child.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.579
How could I bear it if I lost Ross too?

19:38.360 --> 19:39.861
(Sobs)

20:15.400 --> 20:17.027
Ask me, Enys.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.739
Am I cleaning it to put away or...

20:21.640 --> 20:23.619
..do I intend to use it again?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.147
Do you?

20:30.800 --> 20:32.427
If I see a suitable target.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.259
(Coins clinking)

21:01.080 --> 21:03.389
What 'ee be up to, 'ee lizardy,
lousedy piss-a-bed?

21:03.560 --> 21:05.300
Up to? I?

21:05.480 --> 21:07.345
Innocent as a new-born babe.

21:07.520 --> 21:09.829
Witnesses primed
and we've augmented the crowd

21:10.000 --> 21:13.219
with persons who share our view
ofthe accused

21:13.400 --> 21:15.664
and will not scruple
to make their voices heard.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.308
- And His Lordship?
- Is immune to persuasion.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.345
On the contrary.

21:20.520 --> 21:24.229
I believe he was persuaded last night
without a penny changing hands.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.699
(Bell tolls in distance)

21:30.760 --> 21:32.739
GUARD: Jack Tripp, on your feet!

21:35.600 --> 21:37.465
Do you go before the court?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.505
With head held high.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.545
And sore, no doubt.

21:41.720 --> 21:43.585
Not fer long.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.024
The noose is a great curer fer 'eadaches!

21:47.600 --> 21:50.706
I wish you justice - ifthere's any to be found.

21:50.880 --> 21:53.667
Which there ain't - as we both do know.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.307
(Keys jangling)

21:55.480 --> 21:57.459
So luck it must be.

21:58.480 --> 22:00.107
For us both, then.

22:01.440 --> 22:06.787
As ringleader and instigator ofthe affray,
in which you did, unlawfully,

22:06.960 --> 22:09.986
assemble together
a violent and unruly mob,

22:10.160 --> 22:12.139
you have been found guilty.

22:12.920 --> 22:17.141
It now only remains for me to pass
the dreadful sentence ofthe law,

22:18.160 --> 22:21.539
which is that you be taken
from hence to a place of execution,

22:22.760 --> 22:25.945
where you will be hanged by the neck
until you die.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.381
CLERK: Call Ross Poldark!

23:02.560 --> 23:04.380
(Clamouring)

23:08.920 --> 23:10.706
(Angry shouting)

23:15.160 --> 23:17.139
MAN: Murderer!

23:19.840 --> 23:21.501
WOMAN: Murder!

23:21.680 --> 23:22.988
CLERK: Order!

23:23.160 --> 23:24.787
Why do they cry "murder"?
That is not the charge.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.143
Silence in court!

23:26.320 --> 23:28.265
(Hissing and shouting)

23:28.440 --> 23:31.227
- So many against him?
- Only the ones paid by George.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.379
But ifthe jury believe them?

23:49.800 --> 23:54.419
Ross Vennor Poldark,
you stand accused that you did incite riot,

23:54.600 --> 23:56.545
viciously attack a customs officer,

23:56.720 --> 24:01.259
and did plunder diverse goods
belonging to a ship in distress.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.264
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.146
(Clamouring)

24:08.120 --> 24:10.907
- (Door bursts open)
- Let the court beware this man!

24:11.080 --> 24:13.548
A devil in gent's clothing!

24:14.320 --> 24:19.303
He stole my daughter, debauch'd an' left her
unfit for neither man nor beast!

24:19.480 --> 24:20.788
Have him taken.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.748
And when I did go to the rescue o' my child,
this man did viciously assault I -

24:24.920 --> 24:28.299
a poor God-fearing man in his dotage -

24:28.480 --> 24:30.459
with ﬁsts and with weapons.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.707
I tell 'ee, this man do think himself
above the law,

24:33.880 --> 24:38.146
do think he may take whate'er he please
an' ne'er pay the price for it.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.346
I do implore the court to see
thatjustice be done,

24:43.120 --> 24:45.907
in the name ofI an' all
who've suffered at his hands!

24:52.480 --> 24:54.061
Conﬁnue.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.149
Gentlemen ofthe jury.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.187
You'll recall that in this summer's great winds...

25:16.680 --> 25:18.545
just below the house ofthe accused.

25:18.720 --> 25:23.384
You might expect that such a man's first thought
would be the safety ofthe poor souls aboard.

25:24.520 --> 25:27.865
Instead, he sought to rouse
the lawless spirits ofthe district,

25:28.040 --> 25:32.420
so that when the wreck came in,
it might be plundered with the utmost dispatch.

25:33.000 --> 25:38.063
Witnesses will testify that the accused
personally directed the plunder.

25:38.960 --> 25:43.181
And that survivors from the wreck
were beaten as they struggled ashore.

25:44.040 --> 25:47.100
When a contingent of
soldiers and excise men arrived,

25:47.800 --> 25:51.941
the prisoner warned them not to interfere
and threatened them with violence ifthey did.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.942
When they nonetheless went down on the
beach, they were set upon by the accused.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.229
One ofthem received near-fatal injuries.

26:00.920 --> 26:03.548
Did you see the prisoner
attack the customs officer?

26:03.720 --> 26:06.587
Yes, sur.
Seed him strike a blow 'cross his pate.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.945
- And kick him when he's down!
- You liar! That's a lie!

26:10.120 --> 26:12.099
(Angry shouting)

26:13.080 --> 26:16.026
- "Roused from sleep", YOU say?
- Aye, sur. By 'im, SUI“-

26:16.200 --> 26:18.259
- Saying what?
- "Pickings for all!

26:18.440 --> 26:21.147
Hendrawna beach! Wreck's comin' in!
Strip 'er to the last plank!"

26:21.320 --> 26:24.505
When you reached Hendrawna Beach,
what did you see the accused do?

26:24.680 --> 26:28.059
Pluck cargo from the sea, pile it up on
the strand and direct others to do the same.

26:28.240 --> 26:31.186
Did you see him assault the customs officer?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.869
Aye, sur. Assault, sur. Terrible thing, sur.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.701
(Angry shouting)

26:38.800 --> 26:40.108
Order!

26:40.280 --> 26:43.909
Ephraim Oliver, you were on the beach
on the night of January 7th last.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.263
What did you see?

26:45.440 --> 26:49.501
That man striked a gauger across his skull and
kicked 'im to the ground an' leave 'im for dead.

26:49.680 --> 26:53.548
William Fiddick, how close were you
when he struck John Coppard, the excise man?

26:53.720 --> 26:57.383
Close as you be to me, sur,
an' felt the blow like 'twas across me own 'ead.

26:57.560 --> 27:02.304
Sergeant Tremayne, the prisoner warned you
not to go to the beach, yet you did so. Why?

27:02.480 --> 27:06.268
Well, I felt he was casting doubts on my resolve
and goading me to do so.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.859
(Breathes heavily)

27:25.360 --> 27:27.339
Oh, Demelza!

27:29.080 --> 27:32.060
Is it not intolerable in there?
I could scarce breathe.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.219
Nor I.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.499
I came for Francis.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.826
I never thanked you...

27:46.000 --> 27:48.025
for tending me in my sickness.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.779
You saved my son.

27:53.080 --> 27:55.059
And at such a cost.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.383
- How can you bear it?
- I'm with child again.

28:02.640 --> 28:04.505
Is...Ross glad?

28:04.680 --> 28:06.659
I've not told him.

28:07.600 --> 28:10.307
- Ifthings go ill today...
- Pray God they do not.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.306
- I must...
- Of course.

28:32.080 --> 28:33.581
Call Jud Paynter.

28:42.760 --> 28:44.102
(Prosecutor clears throat)

28:45.280 --> 28:49.501
Describe to us, Mr Paynter,
what took place the night ofthe gale.

28:53.040 --> 28:57.545
So there's Prudie - that's the wife -
snorin' fit to rouse the dead.

28:58.720 --> 29:03.145
When along come Cap'n Ross, sayin',
"Ship gone ashore down Hendrawna."

29:03.320 --> 29:06.300
I cannot believe
he would turn against Ross like this.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.505
- Yes?
- Yes.

29:09.680 --> 29:11.989
- And what did he do?
- Do?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.906
Did he urge you to do anything?

29:15.080 --> 29:17.139
Urge? Oh, aye.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.106
'Ee says to I...

29:21.040 --> 29:24.100
"Roust the rest ofthe village
an' head down to the shore."

29:24.280 --> 29:26.259
- Did he give you a reason?
- Reason?

29:27.280 --> 29:28.827
Aye.

29:30.720 --> 29:32.620
"Come now," he says, "sharp as 'ee can,

29:32.800 --> 29:34.347
for likely there's...

29:38.720 --> 29:42.304
..women_ an' children aboard who
need saVIng from a watery grave."

29:42.480 --> 29:45.779
Come, man, recollect yourself.
Think what you're saying.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.266
Aye, that's what 'ee said, right enough.

29:49.440 --> 29:53.581
I tell you, man, to think again. What you say is
not in accordance with your sworn statement.

29:53.760 --> 29:57.821
"When Captain Poldark came to my house,
he told me to hurry and rouse the village

29:58.000 --> 29:59.388
because there was a wreck

29:59.560 --> 30:03.018
and the sooner it was stripped the better,
before the authorities turned up."

30:04.440 --> 30:07.068
No, sur, I never said them words
an' I never thought 'em neither.

30:07.240 --> 30:10.903
I remind you, Mr Paynter,
this statement was made before witnesses

30:11.080 --> 30:13.264
and read aloud to you before you signed.

30:13.720 --> 30:17.178
Aye, well, sur, see...I is 'ard of hearing.

30:18.000 --> 30:24.985
So it's likely I misheard what they said
and they misheard what I said.

30:25.160 --> 30:29.108
Mr Bull, I would have thought it was clear
that this witness has committed perjury -

30:29.280 --> 30:32.386
eithe_r now_
or when he made his orIgInal statement.

30:32.560 --> 30:36.303
I would suggest that you turn him out ofthe box
and get on with your case.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.303
You should have brandished less carrot
and more stick.

30:46.480 --> 30:48.220
We could not possibly have foreseen...

30:48.400 --> 30:51.028
I beg to differ.
These people have peculiar loyalties.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.986
What of Captain Bray?
Did you manage to prevail there?

30:55.160 --> 30:56.946
CLERK: Call Captain Bray.

30:58.840 --> 31:04.949
Describe, Captain Bray, the sight that met
your eyes as you came ashore that night.

31:05.440 --> 31:07.749
Like Dante's Inferno.

31:08.880 --> 31:14.227
Drunken men cavorting, mules struggling
beneath the spoils from the ship.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.740
All semblance of order gone.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.539
'Twas as close to hell as I ever hope to come.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.699
And your passengers and crew?

31:22.440 --> 31:25.227
Confronted by viciousness ofthe grossest kind.

31:26.560 --> 31:29.745
I had to stand guard to prevent them
being torn to pieces.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.827
Thank you, Captain Bray.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.458
Your description would strike a chill
into the heart of any decent human being.

31:35.640 --> 31:36.902
(Murmurs of assent)

31:38.160 --> 31:41.823
The prisoner begs leave to question the witness.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.108
Granted.

31:46.240 --> 31:50.984
Captain Bray, do you recall seeing me
on the beach that night?

31:51.160 --> 31:55.142
You came and offered me and my passengers
shelter in your house.

31:56.040 --> 32:00.625
And did you see or hear me
encouraging anyone to wreck your ship?

32:00.800 --> 32:02.665
It was dark, sir.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.547
But I don't believe I'd set eyes on you
until that moment.

32:06.720 --> 32:10.269
Did you see the meeting of myself
and the captain ofthe soldiers?

32:10.440 --> 32:13.625
As I recall, you warned him
not to go down to the beach.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.587
And did I accompany you into my house, sir?

32:17.720 --> 32:19.824
- You did.
- Thank you.

32:23.640 --> 32:27.940
One moment. How long did the accused
stay with you after you entered the house?

32:29.200 --> 32:30.542
About five minutes.

32:30.720 --> 32:33.302
He said that his wife was ill
and he needed to tend her.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.539
When did you see him again?

32:35.720 --> 32:37.221
About two hours later.

32:37.400 --> 32:39.789
So there was nothing to prevent him
leaving when you were settled

32:39.960 --> 32:42.861
and returning to the beach
to attack the excise men?

32:46.120 --> 32:48.782
- I suppose not.
- Thank you. You may stand down.

32:50.360 --> 32:52.339
(Murmur of conversation)

32:54.200 --> 33:00.469
It's no exaggeration to suggest
that what we have here is a revolutionary.

33:00.640 --> 33:04.383
Self-serving, contemptuous of his class,
careless of other's property.

33:04.560 --> 33:09.782
Of all the crimes committed that night, this man
was the instigator and chief perpetrator.

33:09.960 --> 33:14.021
It is not within my scope to call to attention
the previous acts of lawlessness

33:14.200 --> 33:16.543
- that have marred the accused's character.
- Objection!

33:16.720 --> 33:19.223
Confine yourselfto the present allegations,
Mr Bull.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.507
But it is relevant to draw conclusions
from statements made by the accused

33:23.680 --> 33:25.341
at the time of his arrest,

33:25.520 --> 33:28.341
statements purporting to explain his actions,
justify them,

33:28.520 --> 33:35.460
and which brand him an obvious admirer
ofthe bloodshed and tyranny in France!

33:35.640 --> 33:36.789
(Shouts of agreement)

33:36.960 --> 33:40.339
Asked if he encouraged the riot
which broke out on the beach:

33:41.240 --> 33:43.026
"I did not consider it a riot."

33:43.200 --> 33:45.862
Asked if he approved of
plunder and lawlessness:

33:46.040 --> 33:50.386
"Do you approve ofwhole families being
without sufficient food to keep them alive?"

33:50.560 --> 33:53.745
Asked what part he played
in the death of Matthew Sanson:

33:54.440 --> 33:56.385
"Regrettably none whatsoever."

33:57.160 --> 34:00.948
If you have ever heard a more damning
indictment from a prisoner's own mouth,

34:01.120 --> 34:02.462
I would frankly be amazed.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.619
Such a man is a danger to us all.

34:05.120 --> 34:09.341
The Country and Justice itself
deserves the severest penalty.

34:10.200 --> 34:11.940
The Crown rests its case.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.941
- (Cheering and applause)
- (Judge bangs gavel)

34:17.880 --> 34:19.745
Witnesses for the defence?

34:19.920 --> 34:21.626
Are there any?

34:22.320 --> 34:24.060
Call Dwight Enys.

34:39.160 --> 34:43.506
My Lord, I am the physician who attended
Captain Poldark's wife and child

34:43.680 --> 34:45.989
during their attack ofthe putrid throat.

34:46.560 --> 34:51.429
At that time I was constantly in the house
and can testify that Captain Poldark

34:51.600 --> 34:53.579
had no sleep for almost a week.

34:54.600 --> 34:59.708
His only child died and was buried
but a few days before the wreck.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.701
On the day itself...

35:06.600 --> 35:09.342
..I formed the opinion that he had suffered
a mental breakdown.

35:09.520 --> 35:14.787
I consider that any strangeness in his actions
should almost entirely be attributed to that.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.943
- You're an apothecary?
- A physician, sir.

35:26.120 --> 35:29.908
A licentiate ofthe London College of Physicians
and a Cornishman by birth.

35:30.080 --> 35:33.709
- And an expert on mental afflictions?
- I did not say so.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.828
Then your views on the matter can hardly
be expected to carry much weight.

35:39.480 --> 35:41.459
I believe they can, sir.

35:42.040 --> 35:47.467
In my view, Captain Poldark was, temporarily,
through grief and lack of sleep, not himself.

35:48.080 --> 35:51.026
Do you consider that anyone
who loses a child and a few nights' sleep

35:51.200 --> 35:53.020
is justified in creating a riot?

35:53.200 --> 35:54.462
I do not believe he created the riot.

35:54.640 --> 35:57.905
We require your opinion as a physician, sir,
not as a friend or drinking companion.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.504
I speak purely as a physician and base
my opinion on clinical observation.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.706
Captain Poldark was unsteady on his feet
and disordered in his remarks.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.064
- Perhaps he was drunk.
- He had not touched a drink in days.

36:07.240 --> 36:11.062
My Lord, when his infant daughter died,
a great many people came to the funeral.

36:11.240 --> 36:12.821
All of society, from highest to low.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.900
He's held in very great esteem.

36:15.080 --> 36:18.060
But with his wife ill,
it was impossible to give them refreshment.

36:18.240 --> 36:19.662
This weighed heavy on his mind.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.149
And I suggest to you
that he did provide for them.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.949
In rousing the rabble and leading them to
the wreck, he both assuaged his conscience

36:26.120 --> 36:28.463
and filled his larder with pillaged goods.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.789
That was not my meaning, sir.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.703
Thank you, sir. You paint a very clear picture
ofthe prisoner's state of mind.

36:35.560 --> 36:37.266
(Angry shouting)

36:37.440 --> 36:39.021
Enough!

36:39.200 --> 36:41.100
Remove these persons from the court.

36:41.280 --> 36:42.702
They should be taken out and whipped!

36:44.360 --> 36:46.783
CLERK:
The court will take a short adjournment.

36:47.800 --> 36:49.984
We could not have hoped for a betterjudge.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.025
Poldark will surely hang!

36:52.200 --> 36:53.667
Yes.

36:53.840 --> 36:55.819
That is what you wanted?

37:00.800 --> 37:02.267
The mine he will leave to his wife?

37:02.440 --> 37:04.180
We can soon acquire the shares.

37:04.360 --> 37:07.420
Was she not his kitchen maid?
She will give us no trouble.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.465
Do not believe it.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.619
You will be celebrating tonight.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.141
I certainly intend to.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.109
You could not bear to keep away.

37:27.280 --> 37:30.420
- I was concerned.
- Hm. For me?

37:31.440 --> 37:33.419
Do I not have cause?

37:34.680 --> 37:37.740
Well, as you can see, I am well.
So had you not better return to Trenwith?

37:37.920 --> 37:40.627
Having come so far, I may as well stay.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.700
Ross will be gratified.

37:44.880 --> 37:46.507
Are you?

38:07.320 --> 38:09.299
Are you resolved?

38:10.600 --> 38:12.704
To prostrate myself and beg for mercy?

38:13.640 --> 38:16.188
Good God, man,
do you not see what's happening?

38:16.360 --> 38:19.579
You stand accused of riot and lawlessness.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.264
This country lives in dread of France.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.104
That is why you must grovel.

38:32.160 --> 38:36.062
Do so now or you will not live
to see the sun rise tomorrow.

39:21.480 --> 39:25.621
My Lord...gentlemen ofthe jury.

39:29.800 --> 39:34.942
I can only apologise that this case
has taken so much ofyour time.

39:36.080 --> 39:41.143
I will try to take as little more as may be
necessary to beg your clemency.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.540
It is true that I saw a wreck come in...

39:50.160 --> 39:53.869
..that I rode and told several villagers...

39:55.400 --> 39:59.780
..that a number of people came upon
the beach and that items were carried away.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.187
Though not by me.

40:09.080 --> 40:13.540
My house was searched and none were found.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.342
Why?

40:16.520 --> 40:17.908
Because I took none.

40:21.680 --> 40:25.901
The Counsel has suggested
that I'm a revolutionary...

40:26.920 --> 40:29.184
..that these people are revolutionaries...

40:29.360 --> 40:32.181
branded with a desire to overthrow authority.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.464
Nothing could be further from the truth.

40:34.640 --> 40:40.624
The people of Sawle, Mellin and Grambler
who came upon the beach that day

40:40.800 --> 40:46.579
were ordinary people - no more or no less
law-abiding loyal subjects than any here.

40:48.680 --> 40:51.342
As to what happened
when they came up on the beach,

40:51.520 --> 40:55.263
I ask you to think ofthe traditions of our county.

40:56.240 --> 40:59.300
Our people scour the beaches for flotsam.

40:59.480 --> 41:01.459
This is commonly known.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.742
But in times of dire need,

41:04.920 --> 41:11.348
when fathers have _seen their children _without
a crust for their bellies or a rag for their backs,

41:12.120 --> 41:16.545
these pickings have been the means
of keeping ordinary people alive.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.379
What else would you have them do?

41:23.560 --> 41:28.304
After they have rescued the crew
and brought goods ashore,

41:28.480 --> 41:32.621
are they then to await
the arrival ofthe excise men

41:32.800 --> 41:36.099
and watch them carry offthe goods
that they have salvaged?

41:37.480 --> 41:39.345
You ask ifI was in my right mind?

41:39.520 --> 41:41.784
Well, you've heard evidence that I was not.

41:41.960 --> 41:47.387
But is it insanity to think that rich pickings
strewn across a beach

41:47.560 --> 41:49.619
are better used to sustain those in need

41:49.800 --> 41:52.382
than returned to those whose only goal is profit?

41:52.560 --> 41:54.539
I cannot believe it.

41:55.520 --> 41:57.385
I will not believe it.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.425
I make no apology for my actions.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.989
In truth, I would do the same again.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.339
Thank you.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.899
I've heard more penitent speeches.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.666
But rarely more eloquent.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.819
- My apologies.
- Mm.

42:36.520 --> 42:38.385
What happens now?

42:38.560 --> 42:40.539
The Judge's summing up.

42:41.880 --> 42:43.939
I would not expect much benevolence.

42:44.960 --> 42:48.908
Gentlemen ofthe jury,
this man stands accused of riot, theft

42:49.080 --> 42:51.264
and assaulting an officer ofthe Crown.

42:52.480 --> 42:57.383
Your duty is to decide, beyond reasonable
doubt, ifthe prisoner is guilty or innocent.

42:58.080 --> 43:02.619
But in law, if you are satisfied
that a riot took place,

43:02.800 --> 43:06.145
you only need to be satisfied
that the prisoner was involved,

43:06.320 --> 43:09.778
to find him guilty as a principal.

43:09.960 --> 43:13.464
The prisoner has attempted to find
mitigating circumstances

43:13.640 --> 43:17.098
in the distress generally prevailing
amongst the poor.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.867
You may find this an admirable sentiment,

43:21.040 --> 43:23.508
but you would be failing in your duty

43:24.160 --> 43:27.266
if you allowed it
to influence yourjudgment in any way.

43:28.200 --> 43:30.179
Will you now consider your verdict?

43:31.240 --> 43:33.219
You may retire if you wish.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.742
DWIGHT: Bad, is it not?

43:40.920 --> 43:42.899
Very bad.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.218
Not that I don't admire his stubbornness but...

43:47.920 --> 43:49.899
..he'll pay for it.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.579
Will I have a chance to say goodbye to my wife?

44:04.480 --> 44:08.189
You will be removed from court
and taken directly to your fate.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.579
"The quality of mercy is not strained

44:24.440 --> 44:28.149
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath:"

44:31.880 --> 44:36.385
And God knows, it droppeth sometimes
on those who least deserve it.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.824
I must congratulate you on your eloquence.

44:46.760 --> 44:48.819
You almost convinced me I was guilty.

44:49.560 --> 44:52.267
In truth, I believe there's nothing
either you or anyone could have said

44:52.440 --> 44:54.419
to change the old man's mind.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.062
He seems determined
to make an example of you.

44:59.240 --> 45:00.389
They're coming back.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.260
Gentlemen ofthe jury...

45:19.880 --> 45:21.541
..have you reached a verdict?

45:22.520 --> 45:23.748
We have.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.664
Do you find the prisoner guilty or not guilty?

45:33.560 --> 45:34.902
We find him...

45:37.800 --> 45:39.779
..not guilty on all three charges.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.424
- I thought we'd lost him!
- I was sure of it!

46:14.600 --> 46:18.661
Oh, Francis, dear brother...
Can we not take heart from this?

46:19.960 --> 46:21.587
Is there not hope in it for all?

46:21.760 --> 46:23.739
- Hope?
- Of a reconciling?

46:24.520 --> 46:26.499
Of you and I gladly, gladly.

46:27.800 --> 46:32.066
But, Verity, for your husband?
While I live and breathe - it will never happen.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.305
So he will come home after all.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.345
Yes.

46:50.520 --> 46:52.499
No, no, don't stop on my account.

46:55.640 --> 46:58.461
I wonder if you would have wept so prettily
had I not come home.

47:01.120 --> 47:03.429
Why would you not have come home, Francis?

47:10.560 --> 47:12.585
Let's not distress ourselves to no purpose.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.739
I am coming home.

47:15.960 --> 47:17.939
And so is Ross.

47:18.720 --> 47:20.779
And tomorrow the sun will rise again.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.379
So let us count our blessings.

47:29.360 --> 47:31.419
Seems I shan't be rid of you yet, Captain.

47:31.600 --> 47:35.263
A pity. I was looking forward to dealing
with the sensible side ofthe family.

48:25.440 --> 48:27.305
Is it over? Are 'ee free?

48:27.480 --> 48:29.345
It would appear so.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.499
(Both laugh)

48:32.080 --> 48:33.866
(Jaunty tune)

48:38.640 --> 48:40.267
(She giggles)

48:43.600 --> 48:44.908
How did he get off?

48:45.080 --> 48:49.107
How could the accursed jury disregard
all the evidence and find him not guilty?

48:49.280 --> 48:52.579
And to think I let my uncle persuade me
against pressing a charge of murder!

48:52.760 --> 48:56.184
I tell you, there was not one atom of proof
and we could not have manufactured it.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.463
And Paynter recanted!

48:58.760 --> 49:00.625
He will pay for it shortly.

49:00.800 --> 49:02.586
What now?

49:03.320 --> 49:05.584
Do we...accept defeat?

49:05.760 --> 49:07.739
By no means.

49:10.480 --> 49:13.904
Wheal Leisure is his one real asset.
We must set about buying up shares.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.139
When I control the mine, I control Ross.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.299
And er...Francis?

49:19.480 --> 49:21.220
His finances are in your hands.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.265
You could break him tomorrow.

49:24.840 --> 49:26.307
I could.

49:27.560 --> 49:30.188
But for the moment,
I intend to make no move at all.

49:31.040 --> 49:33.622
- You care nothing for his good will.
- Not his.

49:34.520 --> 49:36.784
But there is another person to consider.

49:47.800 --> 49:48.903
Not guilty!

49:50.520 --> 49:52.340
As I expected.

49:55.040 --> 49:57.019
Sit here, my dear. (Clears throat)

49:57.680 --> 49:59.989
- May I get you a glass ofwine?
- Thank you.

50:13.360 --> 50:14.941
Stay a little longer with us!

50:15.120 --> 50:18.499
Nay, Jinny, leave 'em be.
They'll be wantin' to be away home.

50:29.880 --> 50:32.189
- Caroline.
- Thank you.

50:32.360 --> 50:34.021
Thank you.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.259
- To Westminster!
- To Ross Poldark!

50:37.360 --> 50:39.499
You must toast as your uncle bids you, Caroline.

50:39.680 --> 50:42.023
You are his ward and you must obey his wishes.

50:42.200 --> 50:43.781
And what are his wishes?

50:45.280 --> 50:49.182
Why, for you to engage yourself
to a man of substance and repute.

50:50.560 --> 50:51.788
I intend to.

50:51.960 --> 50:53.939
(Fiddle playing)

50:56.520 --> 50:58.067
Here's to Ross!

50:58.240 --> 51:00.219
ALL: To Ross!

51:06.840 --> 51:07.864
Judas!

51:19.760 --> 51:21.625
I might go to town tomorrow.

51:21.800 --> 51:24.268
I've a notion to engage a couple of servants.

51:26.560 --> 51:28.744
And what sorts would 'ee be lookin' for?

51:29.640 --> 51:31.619
Fiendishly hardworking...

51:32.200 --> 51:34.065
pitifully grateful...

51:34.240 --> 51:36.219
exceedingly cheap.

51:36.920 --> 51:40.504
Ifyou hear of any such,
tell them to make themselves known to me.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.499
You overlook one thing.

51:55.840 --> 52:02.461
Ross Poldark is alive and must be aware
of our attempts to render him otherWIse.

52:04.400 --> 52:05.583
And?

52:06.600 --> 52:11.025
He does not_ strike me as a man who takes such
things lying down. After all, he's a soldier.

52:11.200 --> 52:12.508
A renegade.

52:16.080 --> 52:17.468
Your point?

52:17.640 --> 52:21.861
That in failing to get him hanged,
you have lef yourself exposed.

53:09.920 --> 53:11.820
(Door opens)

53:22.720 --> 53:24.699
I did not care for Bodmin.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.819
This is what I desire.

53:29.760 --> 53:31.227
You, me...

53:32.680 --> 53:35.581
..our house, candles burning...

53:37.320 --> 53:39.299
..the scent of new-picked violets.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.509
Maybe it's because I'm of common stock,
I'm so easily pleased.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.659
Common stock you are not.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.219
There is one thing I do desire.

54:09.560 --> 54:11.505
A child in the crib.

54:13.200 --> 54:14.622
To take her place?

54:14.800 --> 54:16.779
Not to make us forget her.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.819
Do not wish it.

54:23.680 --> 54:25.659
- Not ever?
- Not for now.

54:26.760 --> 54:28.739
With our future so uncertain.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.023
Our future looks kinder than we ever expected.

54:36.680 --> 54:38.147
Much kinder.

54:47.000 --> 54:49.343
I believe we agreed
you would not come to Bodmin.

54:50.320 --> 54:52.459
Yes, Ross, I believe that we did.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.665
Have I told you what I feel
about a disobedient wife?

54:54.840 --> 54:57.741
Have I told you what I feel
about a reckless husband?
