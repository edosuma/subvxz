WEBVTT

00:43.582 --> 00:47.854
Come on ladies, we're pushing pennies
around like a lot of old 'tards here.

00:48.202 --> 00:50.718
Let's see a real bet.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.092
Twice.

01:12.270 --> 01:14.147
- That's better.
- Fold.

01:17.974 --> 01:19.931
All in.

01:23.104 --> 01:25.437
Good morning mate.
Delivery for you.

01:25.641 --> 01:27.531
Fresh as you like.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.202
Bloody hell.

01:32.488 --> 01:34.292
What you plan on
doing with that?

01:34.432 --> 01:36.273
I'm gonna chop his head off.

01:36.414 --> 01:39.487
- You know I'm a vegetarian?!
- For Christ sake Tim!

01:39.884 --> 01:42.321
I'm not asking you
to fucking eat it.

01:42.671 --> 01:44.445
Only chop the head off.

01:44.573 --> 01:47.561
Ben, I can't mate.
Really, I can't.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.338
The head..

01:50.381 --> 01:51.910
Is mine.

01:53.336 --> 01:54.613
All right.

01:55.408 --> 01:57.173
Johnny's got the head.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.249
I've got the belly.

01:59.437 --> 02:00.723
Which leaves you

02:00.774 --> 02:01.908
the legs

02:02.017 --> 02:03.482
the gut

02:03.673 --> 02:05.374
or the fucking tale.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.314
Where's the other fellow?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.814
You're late.

02:28.886 --> 02:30.995
Did I not make myself clear?!

02:31.232 --> 02:33.489
The other fellow, where is he?

02:33.626 --> 02:35.647
We can handle it!

02:35.906 --> 02:37.178
Guarantied!

02:37.413 --> 02:39.542
I need three of you inside.

02:40.004 --> 02:41.133
You've got three of us.

02:41.233 --> 02:44.033
You mean to tell me that tinker
bell here is gonna go inside?

02:44.162 --> 02:45.699
No.. Tinker..

02:46.796 --> 02:49.549
Tim.. will stay in the van.

02:49.696 --> 02:51.103
All right.

02:51.110 --> 02:53.047
So Tink takes the wheel

02:53.118 --> 02:55.790
whilst you and loud
ass there go inside?

02:55.857 --> 02:57.194
The two of you?

02:57.211 --> 02:59.857
- I trust him with my life.
- Yeah, well I don't.

03:00.034 --> 03:03.854
So you find someone else, otherwise,
the deal is of, all right?!

03:15.593 --> 03:17.487
All right.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.721
I'll find another guy.

03:22.399 --> 03:23.752
Okay?

03:24.723 --> 03:26.556
If..

03:26.743 --> 03:29.760
And I mean if this goes
according to plan..

03:30.975 --> 03:32.420
He's got a ring.

03:32.593 --> 03:33.882
You take it!

03:34.023 --> 03:36.432
The ring is very
important to him.

03:36.581 --> 03:39.226
You might say it's
his little friend.

03:39.985 --> 03:41.778
Adios.

03:46.159 --> 03:48.361
Fucking tosser!

04:39.823 --> 04:42.881
- Hello?
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

04:42.975 --> 04:45.504
<i>happy birthday to you</i>

04:45.572 --> 04:48.628
<i>happy birthday dear Michael</i>

04:48.735 --> 04:50.960
<i>happy birthday to you.</i>

04:51.036 --> 04:52.147
Wow, I'm touched.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.405
<i>Love you so much.</i>

04:53.482 --> 04:55.487
Sounds like I'll come in for
a very good night tonight?!

04:55.538 --> 04:57.651
<i>Oh yes, but it was
different in my dreams.</i>

04:57.686 --> 04:58.972
Why is that?

04:59.236 --> 05:01.520
You've been having those
dirty dreams about me again?

05:01.631 --> 05:04.047
<i>Hmm, but it happened in
a Polish restaurant.</i>

05:04.108 --> 05:05.837
- Oh shit.
<i>- Oh yes.</i>

05:06.030 --> 05:09.626
No, that's no good, cause since you've
met me, all your dreams have come true.

05:09.732 --> 05:11.161
<i>I know Michael. Look..</i>

05:11.420 --> 05:13.961
<i>I've ordered a table at
Gordon's, just the two of us.</i>

05:14.088 --> 05:15.758
<i>We have to be there in an hour.</i>

05:16.247 --> 05:17.387
An hour?

05:17.550 --> 05:18.439
<i>Yes.</i>

05:18.474 --> 05:19.979
Well, at least it's not Polish.

05:20.043 --> 05:22.264
<i>Definitely not. And I
have a surprise for you.</i>

05:22.339 --> 05:23.626
Yeah, you should do.

05:23.743 --> 05:25.864
Besides, I've got a little
surprise for you too.

05:26.043 --> 05:28.756
<i>Surprise?! I'm finally
going to meet the queen?</i>

05:28.920 --> 05:30.092
Who told you?

05:30.224 --> 05:31.823
<i>Everybody's talking about it.</i>

05:33.017 --> 05:34.486
No, but..

05:35.009 --> 05:37.074
I do have a little..

05:37.201 --> 05:38.468
<i>Michael?</i>

05:39.371 --> 05:40.628
<i>Michael?</i>

05:40.782 --> 05:42.486
Now, there is a surprise.

05:42.507 --> 05:43.796
<i>What?</i>

05:44.098 --> 05:45.688
I'll be there in a jiffy.

05:45.773 --> 05:47.268
<i>Okay.</i>

05:55.739 --> 05:57.901
What the shitty fuck?!

05:59.153 --> 06:00.430
Let go of me!

06:00.740 --> 06:02.024
What the fuck?!

06:02.198 --> 06:03.363
Take it off!

06:17.279 --> 06:19.297
Please, let go of me.

06:25.535 --> 06:26.535
Help?!

06:26.538 --> 06:28.128
I'll give you anything!

06:31.205 --> 06:32.858
You work for her Majesty?

06:32.869 --> 06:34.048
What's it got to do with you?

06:34.135 --> 06:37.109
You'd take a bullet in your
bullocks for queen and country?

06:37.191 --> 06:37.918
What?

06:37.923 --> 06:41.985
Even though the old deer makes you
work on your fucking birthday.

06:43.838 --> 06:44.992
Johnny, you fucker!

06:44.997 --> 06:46.099
Happy birthday mate.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.175
God save the Queen.

06:47.204 --> 06:48.442
Piss off Ben!

06:48.451 --> 06:49.656
Come on! Come on! Let me out!

06:49.745 --> 06:51.413
You scared the shit out of me.

06:51.517 --> 06:53.642
Here. Happy birthday fellow.

06:53.653 --> 06:55.999
Yeah, what were you doing
with that bunny rabbit, eh?

06:56.043 --> 06:57.245
That is Jess..

06:57.305 --> 06:58.914
Well it was just
Jessica's present.

06:59.011 --> 07:00.612
I was thinking about
you, the whole time.

07:00.615 --> 07:02.181
Oh, you pervert.

07:02.525 --> 07:04.435
- And you?
- Sorry Michael.

07:04.718 --> 07:07.038
We just wanted to give you
the best surprise ever.

07:07.069 --> 07:09.575
Oh why, well you
certainly did that Tim.

07:09.723 --> 07:10.925
No problem there!

07:11.104 --> 07:12.104
All right, let's go!

07:12.253 --> 07:13.818
- Go? Go where?
- Here.

07:14.717 --> 07:15.590
All right, what?!

07:15.617 --> 07:19.383
A wrank looking strip club. Even you're
not thick enough to think of going there.

07:19.417 --> 07:20.417
Oh yeah, we forgot.

07:20.447 --> 07:22.079
You're into cuddly
toys now, aren't you?

07:22.359 --> 07:24.007
I am not going in there!

07:24.037 --> 07:26.537
I don't care what you
say, I've had enough!

07:27.607 --> 07:28.477
Jessica.

07:28.528 --> 07:30.096
- Mickey?!
- No. I'm sorry, I've got to go.

07:30.101 --> 07:32.239
- Must see Jessie, she's waiting on me.
- Mickey, for fuck's sake.

07:32.311 --> 07:34.106
Will you just calm down?!
Mickey please?!

07:34.200 --> 07:37.958
Look! I have to go and see Jessica,
all right?! She's waiting for me.

07:38.003 --> 07:40.293
All right. I see the
surprise is out the window.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.340
But we have to go and tell the girls.
Please, ten minutes?!

07:43.410 --> 07:45.273
No, thank you. It's
not my business!

07:45.340 --> 07:48.430
Come on mate please, for
fuck's sake, do us a favor.

07:49.919 --> 07:51.818
All right, five
minutes, all right?!

07:51.914 --> 07:53.508
And not a heartbeat more!

07:53.590 --> 07:55.934
Okay Mickey. Just
turn the van around.

07:55.996 --> 07:57.766
These girls might
take us by force.

07:57.866 --> 07:58.892
Hopefully.

08:00.464 --> 08:03.270
You sure are fucking cunts!

08:06.470 --> 08:08.281
Let me tell you what John.
He's gonna go

08:08.293 --> 08:10.293
apeshit when he finds out.
It's a fact mate.

08:10.296 --> 08:12.298
Fuck you and your facts Tim.
We stick to the plan!

08:12.310 --> 08:13.560
Here

08:28.840 --> 08:29.986
We're closed.

08:29.991 --> 08:32.060
Closed or not mate, I
have to drop this off.

08:32.084 --> 08:33.564
You're not dropping
anything off mate.

08:33.594 --> 08:37.196
I told you, the bar is closed. So
fuck off and come back tomorrow!

08:37.384 --> 08:39.049
Shut it dickhead!

08:43.879 --> 08:45.969
You know the trouble with
the world right now Karl?

08:46.074 --> 08:47.677
Not enough trust.

08:47.727 --> 08:50.240
But I'm gonna trust these cards.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.922
When I said use your head,
I meant your own one.

08:55.954 --> 08:57.385
Fresh meat.

08:58.403 --> 08:59.625
What?

09:01.783 --> 09:03.797
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't you flinch!

09:03.855 --> 09:05.505
Put your hands on the table!

09:05.600 --> 09:06.705
Where I can see them!

09:06.785 --> 09:08.297
What the fuck is going on here?

09:08.382 --> 09:09.837
Shut your mouth!

09:09.897 --> 09:11.902
Or I'll shut it for you!

09:12.019 --> 09:13.317
Open it up! Come on!

09:15.103 --> 09:17.445
I think you pricks are
a little confused.

09:17.569 --> 09:20.427
Slowly, don't you make me
fucking nervous. Come on!

09:20.433 --> 09:23.415
Do you have any idea who
owns this establishment?

09:23.550 --> 09:24.843
Who sent you?

09:24.899 --> 09:26.397
The international

09:26.474 --> 09:28.321
red fucking cross!

09:32.187 --> 09:34.745
Let's gather the harvest.

09:34.803 --> 09:36.017
Come on gentlemen!

09:37.283 --> 09:38.433
Come on!

09:40.901 --> 09:42.782
Faster gentlemen! Faster!

09:50.201 --> 09:51.435
I said..

09:51.750 --> 09:53.575
Five minutes!

10:07.481 --> 10:08.703
Fuck!

10:13.341 --> 10:16.179
Come on! Faster, you
fucking cripple!

10:21.020 --> 10:23.083
Aren't you forgetting something?

10:24.287 --> 10:25.321
Like what?

10:25.645 --> 10:27.239
Your ring!

10:37.397 --> 10:39.251
Are you deaf?!

10:39.413 --> 10:42.631
Put the ring on the
fucking table!

10:46.027 --> 10:47.237
Shoot!

10:47.785 --> 10:48.855
What?

10:49.092 --> 10:50.327
Shoot him!

10:51.640 --> 10:53.195
No! Oh, no! I can't..

10:53.459 --> 10:54.485
I can't do it!

10:55.805 --> 10:57.360
Fuck! Shoot him!

10:57.539 --> 10:59.344
Motherfucker I'm telling you!

11:00.348 --> 11:01.147
I can't!

11:01.215 --> 11:03.125
Pour his fucking brains out!

11:03.359 --> 11:04.409
Now!

11:04.904 --> 11:05.727
I can't.

11:05.786 --> 11:07.525
You're such a fucking pussy!

11:12.257 --> 11:13.337
Oh Fu..

11:20.534 --> 11:21.984
Get back!

11:25.000 --> 11:27.650
I promise I'll aim
better next time.

11:27.717 --> 11:29.086
You're fucking mental!

11:29.296 --> 11:31.842
Really?! You're not
the first to notice.

11:47.020 --> 11:48.554
I'll find you!

11:48.628 --> 11:50.862
I'll fucking find you!
And when I do..

11:50.984 --> 11:53.430
I'll cut of your fucking balls..

11:53.615 --> 11:55.182
And when you fucking eat them..

11:55.290 --> 11:58.900
I'm gonna pull them out of your
fucking asshole with this hand!

11:58.924 --> 12:01.598
You fucking fat cunt!

12:01.688 --> 12:02.731
Oy?!

12:03.608 --> 12:05.361
Is this what you
were looking for?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.214
What?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.688
Don't play silly
puppets with me!

12:12.964 --> 12:15.770
You wanted your play with
his ring didn't you?

12:16.104 --> 12:17.338
Well, as it happens..

12:17.351 --> 12:19.410
I've grown quite fond of it.

12:19.440 --> 12:21.338
I think I'll just adopt to it.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.450
I'll think of it

12:22.487 --> 12:23.776
as a present!

12:25.351 --> 12:26.874
Fucking knew.

12:27.762 --> 12:29.564
You fucking snake!

12:30.740 --> 12:32.278
Come on! Come on!

12:32.420 --> 12:34.149
Move! Move! Move! Now!

12:40.370 --> 12:41.921
Move! Fucking move!

12:42.588 --> 12:44.830
You come and investigate,
you're the police.

12:44.886 --> 12:46.149
I'll call you back.

12:46.382 --> 12:47.968
Mickey start the van!

12:47.985 --> 12:48.991
Wait, what happened?

12:49.093 --> 12:50.374
Drive! Just fucking drive!

12:50.434 --> 12:51.457
Now wait a minute.

12:51.507 --> 12:52.857
- Move!
- All right!

12:55.818 --> 12:57.412
Shittin' Jesus Christ.

12:57.680 --> 12:58.956
What was all that about?

12:58.980 --> 13:00.148
Nothing Mickey.

13:00.450 --> 13:01.748
- We're all good.
- Good?!

13:01.846 --> 13:04.676
How can it be good Johnny?
I heard a fucking gunshot!

13:04.754 --> 13:06.312
Need to clear your
ears out mate.

13:06.335 --> 13:07.597
Probably just been foy.

13:07.623 --> 13:08.650
Oh fuck off Ben!

13:08.901 --> 13:10.072
Calm down Mickey.

13:10.118 --> 13:11.156
Girls just..

13:11.562 --> 13:12.992
Got a bit upset, that's all.

13:13.087 --> 13:14.782
But we got you a present.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.752
Piss off with your presents!

13:16.896 --> 13:18.028
Are you sure about that?

13:18.078 --> 13:21.587
Don't think you want me fucking
around with your future.

13:22.538 --> 13:23.538
What is that?

13:23.588 --> 13:25.508
Problems with your
eyesight, lad?!

13:25.540 --> 13:26.702
Oh fuck! No!

13:26.797 --> 13:28.727
No! No! No! No! No!

13:39.973 --> 13:41.640
What did you do Johnny? Eh?

13:41.683 --> 13:43.781
What the fuck did you do?

13:46.061 --> 13:47.319
Set you up mate.

13:47.406 --> 13:49.543
Tell me you're just having
another laugh, all right?!

13:49.603 --> 13:53.131
Tell me that this is
just a fucking wind-up.

13:53.772 --> 13:55.014
Not really.

13:55.204 --> 13:57.054
I know you're pissed
off now mate.

13:57.095 --> 13:58.095
But please

13:58.192 --> 13:59.480
just try to calm down.

13:59.544 --> 14:01.239
You tell me to calm down

14:01.279 --> 14:02.860
just one more time

14:02.948 --> 14:04.215
I will fucking end you!

14:04.373 --> 14:07.427
Look at it, we always said
we were to start it new.

14:07.489 --> 14:09.579
Now we can. All of us.

14:10.074 --> 14:11.396
We're sorted.

14:11.496 --> 14:12.873
Whose money is that?

14:12.917 --> 14:14.457
Look at it as a long-term loan.

14:14.541 --> 14:16.231
With payment optional.

14:16.525 --> 14:18.127
Who saw you? you?

14:18.165 --> 14:20.127
As far as I'm aware, no one!

14:20.197 --> 14:21.409
You're in the clear mate.

14:21.473 --> 14:23.538
And by the time those
guys sort themselves out,

14:23.555 --> 14:24.595
we'll be long gone.

14:24.621 --> 14:25.692
Gone?!

14:25.855 --> 14:27.057
Gone where?

14:27.117 --> 14:28.611
Malaysia my friend.

14:28.955 --> 14:32.181
Sunshine. Paradise is
just around the corner.

14:34.091 --> 14:35.745
And we've got a place for you.

14:35.761 --> 14:37.115
If you're willing to join us.

14:37.155 --> 14:38.218
Shit!

14:38.451 --> 14:40.381
This is fucking real?!

14:40.802 --> 14:45.201
You really are all just the
sneakiest, fucking donk shit, right?!

14:45.799 --> 14:47.769
You're right Johnny,
you clever bastard.

14:47.815 --> 14:49.609
Nobody did see me.

14:49.728 --> 14:51.235
So I weren't there.

14:52.097 --> 14:53.702
Just so we're clear?!

14:54.027 --> 14:55.357
I didn't do anything!

14:55.798 --> 14:57.244
You don't know me.

14:57.601 --> 14:59.403
And I don't know you.

14:59.487 --> 15:01.037
Any of you!

15:01.097 --> 15:03.312
And if I ever see you again.

15:03.400 --> 15:04.849
You're fucking dead!

15:04.893 --> 15:06.549
I'll kill ya'll!

15:09.128 --> 15:10.474
His name's John.

15:10.551 --> 15:12.177
I don't know his last name.

15:12.549 --> 15:14.571
That's all I know Paul, I swear.

15:15.113 --> 15:16.439
Believe me.

15:16.554 --> 15:18.673
I know I fucked up, I
fucked up big-time Paul.

15:18.745 --> 15:20.599
But give me a chance, yeah?

15:21.541 --> 15:23.411
And I'll get the fuckers myself.

15:23.763 --> 15:25.273
I promise.

15:25.454 --> 15:27.008
They'll pay.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.066
Yeah, they'll pay.

15:29.202 --> 15:30.962
I'll get the fuckers
myself, and they'll pay.

15:30.993 --> 15:32.704
I promise you they'll pay, ok?

15:32.976 --> 15:34.718
I'll get them! I'll
get them Paul.

15:34.827 --> 15:35.922
Yeah? I'll get them..

15:35.935 --> 15:36.935
Pst!

15:38.279 --> 15:39.805
(SHUT THE) Fuck up!

15:41.206 --> 15:42.485
(OR) I'll crush you!

15:46.735 --> 15:47.937
I believe you.

15:48.019 --> 15:49.289
Yeah?

15:51.281 --> 15:52.663
Everybody pays.

15:52.725 --> 15:53.955
Yeah.

16:07.336 --> 16:09.360
He was in the fucking van.

16:09.585 --> 16:11.655
He seems fucking familiar to me.

16:11.717 --> 16:12.583
How come?

16:12.675 --> 16:14.504
If that really is him then..

16:14.613 --> 16:17.299
Then we've just been fucked
by the honorary guard of her

16:17.325 --> 16:20.223
Majesty, Queen Elizabeth,
the fucking second.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.543
If we get this little
prick, we find the others.

16:23.968 --> 16:25.834
I want you to take
all of our boys

16:25.887 --> 16:27.913
find out where they fucking live

16:27.932 --> 16:29.465
where they drink

16:29.476 --> 16:32.298
and even if they're coming up
to the queen of fucking England

16:32.493 --> 16:34.994
I want them crown jewels.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.120
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you?</i>

17:04.442 --> 17:05.467
Oh, Jess.

17:05.529 --> 17:06.855
Yeah, I.. I'm sorry darling.

17:06.879 --> 17:09.198
<i>- I'm waiting.</i>
- Yeah, I'm on my way there now.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.351
<i>Are you ok? What's
the matter with you?</i>

17:11.533 --> 17:13.094
No no..

17:13.121 --> 17:14.719
No. Everything's honky..

17:14.825 --> 17:16.435
Everything's fine!

17:16.538 --> 17:17.666
Hurry up then.

17:17.717 --> 17:20.259
Yes, yes! I'll be there
in a minute, all right?!

17:29.427 --> 17:30.793
Oh fuck!

17:34.136 --> 17:35.575
- Oh shit!
- He's inside!

17:35.695 --> 17:36.959
Fuck!

17:48.527 --> 17:49.673
Shit.

17:51.199 --> 17:53.024
Fucker's got away.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.212
I need to go to the toilet.

18:35.341 --> 18:37.403
Tim, what the fuck
are you doing?!

18:37.964 --> 18:39.727
You don't know me!

18:40.253 --> 18:41.808
I'll be back in a sec.

18:41.951 --> 18:43.373
Excuse me.

19:11.543 --> 19:12.617
Jesus Christ!

19:12.709 --> 19:14.631
I promised ya'll I'd kill you!

19:14.753 --> 19:17.799
Michael, I'm sorry! I wanted
to tell you, honestly.

19:18.475 --> 19:19.985
Where is it?

19:20.095 --> 19:21.465
I'm sorry.

19:21.973 --> 19:23.159
Where is it?

19:23.254 --> 19:24.844
It's on me!

19:25.305 --> 19:25.991
Fuck!

19:26.015 --> 19:29.561
Michael, don't do this! Listen, right!
There's no way back!

19:31.069 --> 19:33.163
Mike, what the fuck
are you doing?

19:36.535 --> 19:37.225
Mickey..

19:37.251 --> 19:39.689
They found me Johnny!
Do you understand me?!

19:39.903 --> 19:42.573
They found me and then
nearly fucking killed me!

19:42.659 --> 19:44.665
Fuck you Mickeeey!

19:46.883 --> 19:53.222
<i>This is the final boarding call for
passengers on the flight F43421C</i>

19:53.673 --> 19:55.194
to Kuala Lumpur.

19:55.236 --> 19:58.226
<i>Please proceed to
gate C, immediately.</i>

20:09.626 --> 20:12.214
<i>Thick clouds of
ash flew up today</i>

20:12.230 --> 20:14.605
<i>forcing airlines to cancel
thousands of flights.</i>

20:14.614 --> 20:19.008
<i>It drifted at high altitudes south & east,
from an erupting volcano in Iceland.</i>

20:19.438 --> 20:23.512
<i>The airspace shut-down was one of the
most sweeping ever ordered in peace time.</i>

20:23.790 --> 20:26.001
<i>The cloud made up of
minute particles of</i>

20:26.013 --> 20:28.616
<i>silicate, that can severely
damage jet engines,</i>

20:28.704 --> 20:32.872
<i>left airplanes stranded on the tarmac of
some of the world's busiest airports,</i>

20:32.964 --> 20:35.990
<i>as it spread over Britain and
towards continental Europe.</i>

20:36.182 --> 20:40.604
<i>5,000-6,000 of the 28,000 daily
flights across Europe were cancelled,</i>

20:40.710 --> 20:45.348
<i>or redirected to the nearest available
airports, as the results of the ash plume.</i>

20:45.489 --> 20:49.018
<i>The ash plume of volcano Eyjafjallajökull,
was reported to be drifting</i>

20:49.085 --> 20:52.118
<i>at 18,000-33,000 feet
above the earth.</i>

20:52.289 --> 20:56.003
<i>At those altitudes, the cloud is directly
in the road of commercial airliners...</i>

21:19.111 --> 21:20.989
Are you a complete idiot?

21:21.214 --> 21:22.853
Where are you walking?

21:23.050 --> 21:24.487
Fuck off the road!

21:24.675 --> 21:26.414
Excuse me mate. Where are we?

21:26.790 --> 21:29.397
Do you hear me?
FUCK OFF THE ROAD!

21:29.687 --> 21:32.717
Sorry mate, I don't speak
Malaysian, I'm sorry.

21:37.367 --> 21:38.461
We found them.

21:39.167 --> 21:40.837
It was about fucking time.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.997
They didn't get as
far as Malaysia.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.306
Some big volcano has
just erupted in Iceland.

21:45.337 --> 21:46.941
The flight redirected.

21:47.115 --> 21:48.541
To Lithuania.

21:49.901 --> 21:51.775
Lith-a-fucking what?

21:51.959 --> 21:53.249
Lithuania?!

21:53.967 --> 21:55.109
Not Malaysia?!

21:55.511 --> 21:57.489
It's in Eastern fucking Europe.

21:57.651 --> 21:59.749
And the bastards
are still there.

21:59.849 --> 22:01.159
How?

22:01.549 --> 22:03.771
I mean how? How? How
did I get here?

22:04.011 --> 22:06.221
You arrive here
about two hours ago

22:06.461 --> 22:07.539
from the airport

22:07.621 --> 22:09.413
with three friends.

22:10.433 --> 22:12.327
I like them fucking Islandicks.

22:12.445 --> 22:14.935
But I like the
volcanoes even better.

22:15.225 --> 22:17.783
Let's get our asses
fucking out there.

22:35.323 --> 22:37.705
Hey barman, give me some vodka.

22:40.665 --> 22:41.847
Cheers fellow.

23:03.103 --> 23:04.989
Benny my boy, lucky tonight.

23:05.081 --> 23:06.355
See you back at the hotel.

23:06.399 --> 23:07.763
I'll see you later.

23:08.611 --> 23:11.453
Ben, don't you think we
should get back to the hotel.

23:11.534 --> 23:13.183
You've gone fucking soft?!

23:13.378 --> 23:15.243
I'm not going back to
some shitty hotel!

23:15.551 --> 23:18.841
Hello boys. Our hen party
needs some company.

23:19.191 --> 23:20.497
Where're you from?

23:20.839 --> 23:21.969
England.

23:24.367 --> 23:27.197
- Come on girls, surround them.
- All right ladies.

23:27.772 --> 23:29.797
Right here, fucking right here!

23:39.526 --> 23:40.526
Fuck!

24:26.776 --> 24:28.871
Oh, you dumb fucks!

24:47.281 --> 24:48.756
- Hello?
<i>- Michael?</i>

24:49.593 --> 24:50.915
Jessica, thank God!

24:50.971 --> 24:53.173
<i>Were you ever planning
on calling me back?</i>

24:53.417 --> 24:54.647
<i>How could you?</i>

24:54.759 --> 24:56.689
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

24:56.907 --> 25:01.241
<i>What are you doing? Do you
have any idea how I feel?</i>

25:01.664 --> 25:03.081
Yes! Yes I know.

25:03.268 --> 25:05.581
I'll be back in a couple
of hours, I promise!

25:05.789 --> 25:08.605
<i>- I don't give a shit about your promises..</i>
- Jessie listen!

25:09.487 --> 25:10.906
<i>- To what?</i>
- Airport please mate.

25:11.097 --> 25:13.951
<i>You're going to the airport?
Without me?</i>

26:06.195 --> 26:07.854
Good night my friend.

26:35.251 --> 26:37.532
<i>And you can't even explain to
me where you pissed off to?!</i>

26:37.561 --> 26:41.371
<i>Why is that? Just don't call me anymore.
I don't want to hear shit anymore.</i>

26:41.438 --> 26:43.384
Jess, it's very, very confusing!

26:43.478 --> 26:44.336
<i>Is it?</i>

26:44.340 --> 26:45.736
But you have to trust me!

26:45.818 --> 26:46.854
<i>Are you sober?</i>

26:47.044 --> 26:47.661
Yes!

26:47.752 --> 26:49.120
<i>So where are you then?</i>

26:49.902 --> 26:51.980
Lithuan.. Oh, Jesus Christ.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.720
- It doesn't really matter.
<i>- Yes, it does.</i>

26:53.824 --> 26:56.846
I will explain everything to
you, when it becomes clear.

27:03.458 --> 27:06.833
Why've we stop.. Look, can you just
wait a minute? Why've we stopped?

27:06.860 --> 27:09.758
Look! I need to get to the airport mate!
I'm in a bit of a hurry..

27:09.800 --> 27:11.203
Who's this now?

27:11.338 --> 27:13.340
Money, cellphone... Take
out everything you have...

27:13.507 --> 27:14.651
Everything, I said.

27:14.988 --> 27:16.275
<i>What's going on?</i>

27:16.520 --> 27:18.761
<i>- What the hell is happening?</i>
- What are you doing to me?

27:18.832 --> 27:20.240
<i>Are you at a party?</i>

27:28.953 --> 27:31.263
Fucking catch him!

27:31.756 --> 27:33.030
I can't.

27:33.157 --> 27:35.163
Bastard broke my nose.

27:35.225 --> 27:36.571
He got away, son of a bitch!

27:37.004 --> 27:40.171
<i>You're a son of a bitch Michael. How can
you have fun when my heart's broken?</i>

27:40.222 --> 27:41.988
<i>How can I have ever
gotten with you?</i>

27:42.006 --> 27:43.432
<i>And you have nothing
to say for yourself?</i>

27:43.486 --> 27:45.032
<i>You can't even explain yourself?</i>

27:45.134 --> 27:46.189
<i>Fuck you..</i>

28:02.014 --> 28:03.659
How much is in there?

28:06.472 --> 28:07.716
A lot...

28:08.266 --> 28:09.405
Oh fuck!

28:10.242 --> 28:11.844
Oh Jesus Christ.

29:11.056 --> 29:12.120
Hi.

29:12.297 --> 29:14.595
I don't even know
how I got here.

29:14.832 --> 29:17.997
I don't know where any of my
friends are and I need help!

29:19.708 --> 29:21.879
Is your room 1402?

29:22.413 --> 29:24.547
No, yea.. I don't know, why?

29:25.049 --> 29:26.455
We came back..

29:26.555 --> 29:27.855
Hmm... Men!

29:27.909 --> 29:30.167
We said we're friends of yours.

29:31.977 --> 29:33.426
Did they now?!

29:36.021 --> 29:37.067
Johnny?!

29:37.375 --> 29:40.929
Johnny where are you?! Show
me your faces you Li..

29:42.869 --> 29:44.523
- Fuck! Shit!
- That's him!

29:44.607 --> 29:46.013
Who are you? What do you want?

29:46.101 --> 29:48.051
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.675
Oh now, there's been
some kind of a mistake.

29:51.037 --> 29:51.947
Mistake?!

29:51.987 --> 29:54.435
Where there's a lot of greed,
there's plenty of mistakes.

29:54.712 --> 29:57.587
No! You see, I didn't
know anything.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.557
They set me up. They
ruined my plan.

29:59.711 --> 30:01.029
Plan?!

30:01.873 --> 30:04.927
Your plan is going to end
up the same way as Karl's.

30:08.635 --> 30:10.181
Where is the money?

30:11.570 --> 30:13.881
It was in here. I wanted
to give it back to you.

30:13.931 --> 30:17.381
I swear to God, I wanted
to give it back to you.

30:17.567 --> 30:19.414
Where's my fucking ring?

30:20.973 --> 30:22.915
What ring? I don't
know, I don't know.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.377
Get him up! Get him up!

30:27.825 --> 30:30.107
Okay, it's.. It's in my pocket.

30:40.798 --> 30:42.617
Where's my fucking ring?

30:44.333 --> 30:47.135
- I just gave..
- Tony Montana gave me that fucking ring!

30:47.199 --> 30:48.677
Does that ring any
bells with you?

30:48.767 --> 30:50.185
Now where's my fucking ring?

30:50.197 --> 30:52.389
I don't have anything
else to give to you.

30:52.457 --> 30:56.455

see, it's all gone.

32:09.544 --> 32:11.362
You know this?

32:16.037 --> 32:17.918
You want me to be
honest with you?!

32:18.422 --> 32:20.228
They're not my actual friends.

32:20.778 --> 32:24.324
In fact, I barely fucking know
them, but that is not important.

32:26.282 --> 32:28.304

44:45.181 --> 44:46.070

44:46.637 --> 44:49.592
Who the fuck are you? What
the fuck is going on?

44:49.735 --> 44:52.773
This fucker will definitely turn us in.

44:52.932 --> 44:54.638
Back to the grave fucker.

44:59.116 --> 45:00.113
I'll kill you!

44:59.979 --> 45:01.261

More real than St. Teresa's tits.

46:04.240 --> 46:05.591
OK.

46:06.422 --> 46:08.780
I've got some tourists visiting today...

46:08.939 --> 46:10.152
Where from?

46:10.315 --> 46:16.965
They don't have signs stapled to their asses,
but they paid with the same money.

46:38.313 --> 46:40.683
Copper, where is
my fucking money?

46:42.037 --> 46:43.585

Ahh Jesus.

49:46.001 --> 49:47.539
Can you move?

49:49.117 --> 49:51.631
Your fucking radiator
is on top of me.

49:53.973 --> 49:55.331
My radiator?!

49:55.850 --> 49:56.850
Ask me..

49:57.175 --> 49:58.875
How I've become attached
to this fucking radiator.

49:58.891 --> 50:01.357
I should have killed you
in that fucking apartment.

50:01.481 --> 50:02.711
Fuck you!

50:06.921 --> 50:08.395
Help!

You skinny, Lithuanian bitch!

50:11.939 --> 50:13.409

50:15.971 --> 50:17.441
covered in claret (BLOOD)

50:17.583 --> 50:19.321
handcuffed!

50:19.673 --> 50:21.515
Hey, steady..

50:22.397 --> 50:23.731
It's my phone.

50:23.791 --> 50:25.185
It's in the pocket.

50:25.579 --> 50:26.649
Can you help?

50:27.211 --> 50:28.561
Help.. you?!

50:29.313 --> 50:30.459
Well yeah.

help yourself, ha?!

50:35.191 --> 50:36.577
Fine.

50:58.109 --> 50:59.411

51:03.380 --> 51:05.123

51:05.248 --> 51:07.387
Hey, I'm military! Do
you understand that?

51:07.549 --> 51:09.551
That means they'll
come looking for me.

51:09.815 --> 51:11.316
And they'll find me to. That..

51:11.616 --> 51:13.016
That.. That is for sure!

51:13.259 --> 51:14.497
Oh, come on lads.

51:14.611 --> 51:18.041
I work for her Majesty' service.
Do you understand? The Queen?

51:18.457 --> 51:19.659
Oh come on, lads.

51:19.759 --> 51:23.559
I'm the head of the honorary guard.
I'm a very important person!

51:24.032 --> 51:25.274
Yeah?!

51:28.094 --> 51:29.399
You're fucking dead.

53:02.554 --> 53:04.043
Staska, is that you?

53:04.208 --> 53:06.228
Your Saule is a real slut...

53:06.393 --> 53:08.818
...yesterday she came
back with a couple of wankers.

53:09.569 --> 53:11.228
I didn't know them.

54:02.338 --> 54:03.602
Fuck.

54:07.290 --> 54:08.840
Tim, get up!

54:31.452 --> 54:34.026
I don't mean to be
rude, darling, but..

54:34.697 --> 54:35.866
Do we know each other?

54:36.036 --> 54:37.510
Fuck you.

54:38.198 --> 54:39.524
And by the way..

54:39.686 --> 54:42.076
You both having me a striptease

54:42.267 --> 54:43.988
for my party.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.582
Aw fuck! Where'd you
get my ring from?

54:49.306 --> 54:50.560
You gave it to me

54:50.660 --> 54:51.960
as my wedding gift.

54:52.428 --> 54:53.578
Wedding?!

54:55.154 --> 54:57.020
What fucking wedding?

54:57.310 --> 54:59.396
My wedding, your gift!

54:59.568 --> 55:01.417
Do you remember anything?

55:03.160 --> 55:04.254
Whatever!

55:04.458 --> 55:05.480
I want my ring!

55:05.588 --> 55:07.396
Let me go man!

55:09.832 --> 55:11.298
This ring costs too much

55:11.390 --> 55:14.416
to give to some fucking..

55:15.576 --> 55:17.026
Fucking hell.

55:23.237 --> 55:24.423
Fuck! Staska.

55:26.444 --> 55:27.915
Who's that?

55:28.094 --> 55:29.266
My fiancé.

55:29.416 --> 55:31.447
We are getting married tomorrow.

55:32.064 --> 55:33.578
All right.

55:36.864 --> 55:39.886
Maybe your boyfriend can
take us to the hotel.

55:40.454 --> 55:43.204
Jesus Christ, I'll
fucking pay him.

55:49.071 --> 55:52.089
Saule, I brought clothes for the musicians...
When are they arriving?

55:52.246 --> 55:53.398
What clothes?

55:54.137 --> 55:55.289
What clothes?!

55:56.299 --> 55:59.511
Sober up! Wedding's tomorrow.
Or are you going to sing?!

56:05.696 --> 56:07.239

56:09.630 --> 56:11.644
That is not fucking me!

56:11.744 --> 56:12.744
Staska.

56:11.827 --> 56:12.819
Staska.

56:14.786 --> 56:15.786
Fucking take it.

56:16.239 --> 56:17.335
Who's that?

56:17.465 --> 56:20.820
Look at what those bastards have done.

56:20.977 --> 56:24.422
I've already told Staska. I've seen everything.

56:24.587 --> 56:26.677
You can't see anything!

56:26.840 --> 56:29.596
Staska easy...

56:32.978 --> 56:34.280
Look, love..

56:34.688 --> 56:36.258
Just give us the ring back

56:36.716 --> 56:38.926
and we'll fucking leave.

56:38.997 --> 56:41.070
Yeah. We've got to make
a move, to be honest.

56:41.165 --> 56:42.586
It's been an absolute pleasure.

56:43.048 --> 56:44.886
Leave the fucking ring, yeah?!

56:44.984 --> 56:46.802
Peace. Bye bye.

56:48.739 --> 56:53.483
What the fuck is all this "pyst" and "bai bai"?

56:54.370 --> 56:55.861
They are tourists, Staska...

56:56.026 --> 56:58.850
They're from England.
Where Andzeika was deported from.

56:59.008 --> 57:02.329
They came here by accident,
they thought it was a hotel.

57:04.011 --> 57:07.264
What kind of hotel... in my house?

57:11.133 --> 57:13.923
Where does it say, that my house is a hotel?

57:14.081 --> 57:17.335
Staska, calm down...These people are from the
West... What will the world think about us?

57:17.461 --> 57:21.246
No, you calm down! In a second, the
world will become very small for you...

57:21.403 --> 57:25.842
Staska, hold on, you don't understand. These
poor people are gays from London. Look at them.

57:31.606 --> 57:34.961
They came to that gay parade and got lost.

57:39.656 --> 57:44.130
My house, a gay hotel?!

57:47.607 --> 57:50.069
Staska... Listen...
I don't remember much myself...

57:50.224 --> 57:52.552
...I will show them a fucking parade... I will...

57:53.007 --> 57:54.476
Staska, listen... They are only tourists...

57:54.631 --> 57:55.727
Shut up, you slut...

57:55.956 --> 57:58.712
Staska! I'm no slut! I've got dreams...

58:03.840 --> 58:04.937
What?

58:05.397 --> 58:08.752
Dreams! I want to be a film critic...

58:11.261 --> 58:13.249
Fucking WHAT???

58:15.833 --> 58:17.923
I'll make you a film critic myself...

58:18.981 --> 58:22.663
I'll make film critics out of all of you.

58:35.809 --> 58:36.906
Staska, what's going on?

58:37.068 --> 58:40.683
Gay tourists just made a pit stop in my bed!

58:45.751 --> 58:49.230
Bastards! Come here! I'll
fucking show you Lithuania!

58:51.551 --> 58:52.320
Fuck!

58:53.334 --> 58:54.341
Forrest Timmy!

58:54.441 --> 58:55.841
Run for the switch!

59:44.804 --> 59:46.215
Hey pal!

59:46.460 --> 59:48.350
Can you help us?

59:52.344 --> 59:54.562
Why the fuck he's running for.
What's he..

59:58.170 --> 59:59.416
Oh for fuck's sake.

59:59.680 --> 1:00:02.022
Why would you change the side
of the fucking steering wheel?!

1:00:02.072 --> 1:00:03.422
Why would you fucking do that?!

1:00:03.453 --> 1:00:05.500
- Move over you fucking cunt.
- This fucking country is mental.

1:00:05.537 --> 1:00:07.515
Just drive ok?!

1:00:07.565 --> 1:00:09.015
Shut the fuck up Timmy!

1:00:13.902 --> 1:00:16.914
Fuck! Our van!

1:00:18.017 --> 1:00:20.973
Staska... cops... ambush...

1:00:21.095 --> 1:00:25.556
An ambush, fucking shit... Fucking tourists...

1:00:54.629 --> 1:00:56.204
Well don't just sit there.

1:00:56.501 --> 1:00:58.079
Call Johnny.

1:00:58.371 --> 1:01:00.937
With what, eh?! The
fucking phone?!

1:01:01.489 --> 1:01:03.383
It's in the forest somewhere.

1:01:05.419 --> 1:01:07.513
You fucking twat.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:25.582

1:01:34.361 --> 1:01:36.508
Come on. Fucking get up!

1:01:37.565 --> 1:01:38.879
Where?

1:01:39.121 --> 1:01:40.227
Which way?

1:01:40.475 --> 1:01:42.305
Well I don't know, do I?

1:01:42.917 --> 1:01:45.224
Hey Tim, look at all this grass.

1:01:45.599 --> 1:01:48.089
You eat like a fucking
rabbit, don't you?!

1:01:49.375 --> 1:01:51.229
I knew this would go tits up.

1:01:51.613 --> 1:01:52.919
But like a mug

1:01:53.119 --> 1:01:54.319
I've signed up for it.

1:01:54.679 --> 1:01:55.693
With another mug.

1:01:55.793 --> 1:01:57.493
You!

1:01:58.941 --> 1:02:00.183
Fuck off!

1:02:00.907 --> 1:02:02.149
What?

1:02:08.823 --> 1:02:10.517
It's a fucking tattoo.

1:02:10.643 --> 1:02:11.977
When?

1:02:17.877 --> 1:02:18.511
You

1:02:18.861 --> 1:02:20.123

1:02:20.143 --> 1:02:21.143
twat!

1:03:19.809 --> 1:03:21.137
Jesus Christ!

1:03:24.944 --> 1:03:26.347
That ain't Jesus.

1:03:26.911 --> 1:03:28.169
Not at all.

1:03:45.609 --> 1:03:46.609
Excuse me please

1:03:46.667 --> 1:03:48.595
- Are we arrive?
- Who? You?

1:03:49.250 --> 1:03:50.736
We. Arrive.

1:03:51.446 --> 1:03:52.668
Where you from please?

1:03:52.757 --> 1:03:55.341
Who, Me?! I'm from England.
Where the fuck are you from?

1:03:55.565 --> 1:03:58.102
And what you're doing
all cooped-up in there?

1:03:58.206 --> 1:03:59.275
England.

1:03:59.572 --> 1:04:00.610
England.

1:04:07.540 --> 1:04:08.778
- England.
- Get the fuck off!

1:04:08.888 --> 1:04:12.354
Thank you my friend.

1:04:14.165 --> 1:04:15.812
What the fuck are you doing?!

1:05:04.783 --> 1:05:06.927
BAR "LAIR"

1:05:50.405 --> 1:05:52.281
We're short on strong beer.

1:05:53.068 --> 1:05:54.300
Excuse me.

1:05:54.761 --> 1:05:56.342
Do you speak English?

1:05:57.106 --> 1:05:58.533
We're a bit lost, yeah?!

1:05:58.886 --> 1:06:00.649
And we need to call a taxi.

1:06:02.757 --> 1:06:03.951
Taxi?

1:06:05.263 --> 1:06:07.241
We need to go back to the..

1:06:07.471 --> 1:06:08.649
Hotel.

1:06:10.383 --> 1:06:11.891
Andzeika.

1:06:12.461 --> 1:06:13.969
Andzeika!

1:06:14.604 --> 1:06:15.587
What do you want?

1:06:15.744 --> 1:06:17.024
What! What!?

1:06:18.793 --> 1:06:20.072
Don't listen to him.

1:06:21.741 --> 1:06:23.855
Andzeika worked in England,
in construction somewhere...

1:06:23.986 --> 1:06:29.619
Then he murdered someone there, but got away...
he proved he's nuts.

1:06:33.883 --> 1:06:34.921
Hello.

1:06:35.355 --> 1:06:37.025
We need to call a taxi.

1:06:37.556 --> 1:06:38.538

1:06:39.097 --> 1:06:41.953
Do you know how badly they fucked us there?

1:06:42.348 --> 1:06:44.495

1:06:53.073 --> 1:06:54.819

1:07:39.165 --> 1:07:41.334
We need to go to Vilnius.

1:07:41.467 --> 1:07:43.076
Are you <i>kurwa</i> nut?

1:07:43.450 --> 1:07:46.108

1:08:05.947 --> 1:08:07.870
and they will bring
it here, all right?!

1:08:08.001 --> 1:08:10.583

1:11:33.260 --> 1:11:36.669
There is no God in
this fucking country.

OK. Can you tell me why he's
strapped to this radiator?

1:12:26.792 --> 1:12:28.651
Damask.

1:12:30.328 --> 1:12:32.480
I need coffee.

1:12:42.456 --> 1:12:43.549
So, coffee for you?

1:12:44.474 --> 1:12:45.753
Sure.

1:12:51.384 --> 1:12:52.714
Hey thanks.

1:12:55.574 --> 1:12:56.740
No problem.

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:01.554
So I'm a..

1:13:02.596 --> 1:13:04.290
Flying off to Malaysia tonight.

1:13:05.806 --> 1:13:07.528
My mates are probably..

1:13:07.977 --> 1:13:09.446
On their way already.

1:13:11.382 --> 1:13:12.792
I'm jealous.

1:13:15.942 --> 1:13:17.396
Hold that thought.

1:13:17.878 --> 1:13:18.878
I

1:13:19.114 --> 1:13:20.436
Will be back in a sec.

1:14:39.030 --> 1:14:40.612
So, what's next?

1:14:41.007 --> 1:14:42.790
I'd just love to get
rid of this thing.

1:14:43.212 --> 1:14:44.686
Keep it as a souvenir.

1:14:45.488 --> 1:14:46.862
Okay, let's go.

1:14:57.326 --> 1:14:58.616
Fuck!

1:15:25.598 --> 1:15:27.204
This is just fucked! Move!

1:16:21.748 --> 1:16:22.845
Get back!

1:16:29.124 --> 1:16:30.674
The money's in the hotel.

1:16:30.777 --> 1:16:32.594
In the toilet. I'll
show you everything.

1:16:32.732 --> 1:16:34.295
Don't worry about the money.

1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:36.082
We have the money.

1:16:37.288 --> 1:16:39.150
I got a little surprise for you.

1:16:46.816 --> 1:16:48.150
Mickey, forgive me.

1:16:48.567 --> 1:16:49.988
Forgive me Mickey.

1:16:58.270 --> 1:17:00.884
I will fucking kill you myself!

1:17:01.026 --> 1:17:02.476
You fucking cunt!

1:17:06.870 --> 1:17:08.560
Are we finished ladies?

1:17:12.076 --> 1:17:14.134
Now where's my fucking ring?

1:17:14.644 --> 1:17:15.982
Ring?

1:17:21.972 --> 1:17:23.702
That fucking ring!

1:17:24.097 --> 1:17:25.974
Fucking Johnny, you cunt!

1:17:26.046 --> 1:17:27.504
Don't fuck with me!

1:17:39.946 --> 1:17:41.376
<i>Hello, Johnny?</i>

1:17:42.168 --> 1:17:43.168
Johnny?

1:17:43.750 --> 1:17:45.332
<i>It's Ben, hello?</i>

1:17:45.654 --> 1:17:47.476
You listen to me very carefully!

1:17:47.570 --> 1:17:48.342
Who is this?

1:17:48.520 --> 1:17:49.683
Where's Johnny?

1:17:49.846 --> 1:17:50.846
Where's Michael?

1:17:51.232 --> 1:17:53.418
Your two mates will fucking live

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:55.570
as long as my
patience holds out.

1:17:56.094 --> 1:17:57.880
Now, you bring my
fucking ring to me

1:17:57.910 --> 1:18:00.960
and you bring it very delicately,
between your fucking teeth!

1:18:01.144 --> 1:18:02.571
<i>Do you understand?</i>

1:18:04.264 --> 1:18:05.918
<i>I said, do you understand?!</i>

1:18:18.624 --> 1:18:19.858
Now, one more pause out of you

1:18:19.972 --> 1:18:21.902

fucking skull away

1:18:21.952 --> 1:18:23.782

1:18:27.972 --> 1:18:29.025
Talk!

1:18:55.670 --> 1:18:56.756
I don't have the ring.

1:18:56.814 --> 1:18:59.160
I don't have that fucking

No ring Johnny!

1:19:04.044 --> 1:19:05.044
No ring!

1:19:23.047 --> 1:19:25.884
They're coming to the wedding.

1:20:05.301 --> 1:20:07.946
Dear friends, family...

1:20:08.377 --> 1:20:11.992
We are blessed by God to be able to witness...

1:20:12.155 --> 1:20:19.019
...the joining of this beautiful couple

1:20:19.177 --> 1:20:20.716

1:20:37.162 --> 1:20:40.180
Dress up! You'll be dancing
'cause of wedding.

1:20:43.619 --> 1:20:46.127
As confirmation of your
vows to join your lives,

1:20:46.293 --> 1:20:49.465
to work at all times to create
a life that is complete

1:20:49.486 --> 1:20:52.368
and unbroken, and to love each other without end.

1:20:53.315 --> 1:20:56.097
Ring fits perfectly. A good sign.

1:20:58.632 --> 1:21:00.445
Really Christian...

1:21:10.301 --> 1:21:12.445
Happily ever after. Hallelujah!

1:21:35.979 --> 1:21:43.037
One-two-three Staska is the best one!
Three-two-one Staska is the boss off all!

1:21:58.884 --> 1:21:59.887
Bottoms up!

1:22:13.896 --> 1:22:17.681
Staska, we hope you never change.

1:22:19.046 --> 1:22:20.152
Where are the pricks?

1:22:20.851 --> 1:22:21.888
Getting dressed...

1:22:24.529 --> 1:22:25.566

1:22:26.234 --> 1:22:28.445
On the central street. Waiting...

1:22:40.316 --> 1:22:42.780
Now, I don't give a
fuck who you two are.

1:22:42.902 --> 1:22:44.660
But I wanna know where
the fat man is?

1:22:44.959 --> 1:22:46.407

Look at the camera... raise your

1:24:00.357 --> 1:24:01.840
Smile... a little bit bigger...

1:24:04.904 --> 1:24:07.219
