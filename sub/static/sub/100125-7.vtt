52:31.615 --> 52:33.850
just like Clay deserved
what he got.

52:36.719 --> 52:39.822
And yet you saved him.

52:39.856 --> 52:42.759
I just, um...

52:39.856 --> 52:42.759
I'm not here
to judge you, Henry.

52:44.827 --> 52:46.429
I'm here to serve you.

52:49.132 --> 52:50.367
What?

52:50.400 --> 52:52.936
I've been searching,
seeking guidance,

52:52.969 --> 52:54.771
and there is a plan
for all of us.

52:57.840 --> 52:59.242
God has a plan.

53:00.543 --> 53:02.178
So there has got to be
a reason for you...

53:02.212 --> 53:04.347
Oh, Lucas.

53:02.212 --> 53:04.347
For what you can do.

53:04.381 --> 53:06.249
Listen, my family,
they're evil, and I know that.

53:06.282 --> 53:07.516
They're fucking rotten
to the core.

53:07.550 --> 53:09.719
My dad and my brother,
what they did to you?

53:11.921 --> 53:14.024
They treated you like nothing.
They didn't see you.

53:14.057 --> 53:16.459
But I see you, Henry.

53:19.462 --> 53:20.697
I've never witnessed
what you can do,

53:20.730 --> 53:22.198
but I believe it.
I know you can do it.

53:22.231 --> 53:24.634
[LAUGHING ]
That is what faith is.

53:24.667 --> 53:26.603
I see you
for who you really are.

53:28.805 --> 53:29.972
[SCOFFING]
I can't do this.

53:30.006 --> 53:31.707
You are an angel, Henry...

53:31.740 --> 53:32.976
[LAUGHS]

53:33.009 --> 53:35.211
On a mission from God.

53:35.245 --> 53:38.582
And it is my job
to protect you.

53:56.232 --> 53:58.235
Henry?

54:04.373 --> 54:06.543
You don't need to say anything,
not yet.

54:07.644 --> 54:10.980
Just know
that I believe in you.

54:11.014 --> 54:14.517
You can count on me,
and I'll always be here
whenever you need me.
