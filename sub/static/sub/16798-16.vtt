WEBVTT

00:01.825 --> 00:03.985
- Ten, nine...
- Hold on. Are you crazy?

00:03.985 --> 00:05.969
- Are you crazy?
- It's the Project Runway finale.

00:05.970 --> 00:07.418
- You're crazy.
- So you can DVR it!

00:07.419 --> 00:09.253
Just stop ruining my life.

00:09.254 --> 00:11.622
Oh, my... you know what? You know what?!

00:11.623 --> 00:12.890
You are so dead!

00:12.891 --> 00:14.391
- I-I actually didn't do it.
- You know what, Alison?

00:14.392 --> 00:16.193
- I didn't.
- Then who did?! What are you...?

00:16.193 --> 00:18.897
- Ready for the Runway?
- Of course, of course it was the other one.

00:18.898 --> 00:20.457
Uh, no, the real world, actually.

00:20.458 --> 00:21.959
President Dalton gave

00:21.960 --> 00:24.328
his, uh, State of the
Union, like, an hour ago.

00:24.329 --> 00:25.219
I have to be up

00:25.220 --> 00:27.414
on what the cable-verse
thinks for work tomorrow.

00:27.415 --> 00:29.163
Oh, great. So just
because you're interning

00:29.164 --> 00:31.098
for Russell Jackson,
you have to stay current

00:31.099 --> 00:32.800
on how screwed-up the world is?

00:32.801 --> 00:37.071
Guys, Mom has spent the
last six months negotiating

00:37.072 --> 00:39.540
a global climate deal, and the
president announced it tonight.

00:39.541 --> 00:41.809
It's like the moon
shot of our generation.

00:41.810 --> 00:43.244
More than 200 countries

00:43.245 --> 00:44.945
committed to the Stockholm Protocols'

00:44.946 --> 00:46.981
sweeping carbon emission benchmarks.

00:46.982 --> 00:49.083
But the crown jewel for President Dalton

00:49.084 --> 00:51.018
was getting India and China on board.

00:51.019 --> 00:52.286
The question now:

00:52.287 --> 00:54.121
will the treaty pass the U.S. Senate?

00:54.122 --> 00:56.957
Ah. Hey, look who's civically engaged.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.392
Hey.

00:58.393 --> 01:01.462
Do you guys think that
the Senate's gonna ratify?

01:01.463 --> 01:06.400
You mean act rationally and
sacrifice minor short-term

01:06.401 --> 01:08.202
domestic economic gains
for the greater good?

01:08.203 --> 01:10.538
Oh, yeah, they always
do stuff like that.

01:10.539 --> 01:12.106
I have faith.

01:12.107 --> 01:14.508
In the scorched-earth fight

01:14.509 --> 01:16.944
our president is willing to wage

01:16.945 --> 01:21.282
to bulldoze those who
would deny reality.

01:21.283 --> 01:25.186
Scorched earth over scorched earth?

01:25.187 --> 01:26.887
Appropriate.

01:26.888 --> 01:28.189
I need ice cream.

01:28.190 --> 01:29.790
You were really playing
Titanfall, weren't you?

01:29.791 --> 01:31.559
- I mean, you know...
- Weren't you? Huh?

01:31.560 --> 01:33.023
If the State of the Union had

01:33.024 --> 01:34.361
just a few more explosions...

01:34.362 --> 01:37.064
- Hello. Who?
- I want to watch Project Runway.

01:37.065 --> 01:38.566
Oh, God.

01:38.567 --> 01:39.533
Uh, yeah, let him in.

01:39.534 --> 01:40.701
Who is it? The Grim Reaper?

01:40.702 --> 01:41.869
Pretty much.

01:41.870 --> 01:43.938
You sure you don't want a spoon?

01:43.939 --> 01:46.740
Mm, no, thanks.

01:46.741 --> 01:49.743
So, I hear you are meeting

01:49.744 --> 01:52.646
with the Dalai Lama tomorrow.

01:52.647 --> 01:55.049
Been on my schedule for months.

01:55.050 --> 01:56.417
I doubt you just heard.

01:56.418 --> 01:59.386
But I did just hear from the
Chinese president about it.

01:59.387 --> 02:02.857
I'm sure that you explained
to him that our policy

02:02.858 --> 02:05.626
towards Tibet has not changed,

02:05.627 --> 02:09.896
and we would never
let the Chinese dictate

02:09.898 --> 02:14.401
with whom our secretary of
state can or cannot meet.

02:14.402 --> 02:19.073
President Li and I simply
agreed this is a delicate time.

02:19.074 --> 02:21.108
Often the first step toward appeasement.

02:21.109 --> 02:22.877
The Chinese have had a bug up their ass

02:22.878 --> 02:25.246
about the Dalai Lama since the 1950s,

02:25.247 --> 02:28.282
when they first drove him from
his spiritual seat in Tibet.

02:28.283 --> 02:30.818
To them, he's a font
of separatist rhetoric,

02:30.819 --> 02:32.853
hell-bent on breaking away from China,

02:32.854 --> 02:36.624
so it is indeed delicate.

02:36.625 --> 02:39.727
Are you really mansplaining
Tibetan history to me?

02:39.728 --> 02:41.595
We need China on board

02:41.596 --> 02:43.731
for the president to
deliver on his promise

02:43.732 --> 02:46.500
to fight climate change,
which I know you know.

02:46.501 --> 02:48.002
And you also know

02:48.003 --> 02:51.338
that in just five days,
China's congress decides

02:51.339 --> 02:53.540
whether or not to ratify the treaty.

02:53.541 --> 02:56.710
After that, you can go
on Dancing With the Stars

02:56.711 --> 02:59.679
with the Lama for all I care.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.917
Please, Elizabeth.

03:02.918 --> 03:04.685
Please? Really?

03:04.686 --> 03:07.987
Does Conrad even know you're here?

03:11.025 --> 03:13.092
The president says...

03:14.561 --> 03:15.963
...it's your call.

03:15.964 --> 03:17.131
Look.

03:17.132 --> 03:21.435
I get that the timing
of this isn't great.

03:21.436 --> 03:24.605
But as we know, this meeting has been

03:24.606 --> 03:26.807
on the books for some time.

03:26.808 --> 03:30.244
And caving to Chinese pressure about it

03:30.245 --> 03:32.313
would set a terrible precedent.

03:32.314 --> 03:35.482
That said,

03:35.483 --> 03:37.985
I can pare back the coverage.

03:37.986 --> 03:41.455
Try and keep the visit
under the radar, I guess.

03:41.456 --> 03:43.824
Thank you.

03:43.825 --> 03:47.094
Good morning. Any word from Ian?

03:47.095 --> 03:49.196
Still radio silence.

03:49.197 --> 03:52.599
Dead militia member
and an asset gone quiet.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.368
- Go, team.
- Yeah.

03:54.369 --> 03:55.569
Good morning.

03:55.570 --> 03:57.738
Good morning.

03:57.739 --> 04:00.741
DOJ ruled that Ian's kill was justified.

04:00.742 --> 04:02.977
Wayne O'Connell's wounds were consistent

04:02.978 --> 04:04.645
with Ian's account of the attack.

04:04.646 --> 04:07.448
Okay. And what about the
disposition of the body?

04:07.449 --> 04:09.616
Office of Legal Counsel
wants it released

04:09.617 --> 04:10.985
to the family immediately.

04:10.986 --> 04:12.486
And say what?

04:12.487 --> 04:16.156
That he was killed during an
FBI sting into his death cult?

04:16.156 --> 04:18.591
We can't risk word that the
investigation will get back

04:18.593 --> 04:20.094
- to the VFF.
- That's right.

04:20.095 --> 04:22.730
You want to pull Ian out.

04:22.731 --> 04:24.932
I don't see how we
have any other choice,

04:24.933 --> 04:26.500
unless you expect the Federal Bureau

04:26.501 --> 04:27.924
- to disappear a body.
- Okay, look.

04:27.925 --> 04:29.837
I have a meeting scheduled
with Ian tomorrow.

04:29.838 --> 04:31.772
Assuming he shows,
I'll give him a camera.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.707
As far as the militia's concerned,

04:33.708 --> 04:35.642
Wayne O'Connell is just missing.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.611
Let's give Ian more
time to gather evidence,

04:37.612 --> 04:40.014
then we can pull him out,
grab the drone and the bomb,

04:40.015 --> 04:41.648
and then release O'Connell's body.

04:41.649 --> 04:45.519
The most I can get the
DOJ to hold is four days.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.855
That's how long you have
to me something actionable.

04:52.894 --> 04:54.728
Preparations for the sand mandala

04:54.729 --> 04:56.230
- are going well.
- I don't get it.

04:56.231 --> 04:57.831
These monks spent all week

04:57.832 --> 05:00.034
painstakingly arranging colored sand

05:00.035 --> 05:01.535
to fit this blueprint,

05:01.536 --> 05:03.670
and when, whoosh, they
just sweep it away.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.905
Wh-What's the point?

05:04.906 --> 05:06.173
That is the point.

05:06.174 --> 05:07.441
Everything's transitory.

05:07.442 --> 05:09.710
Everything ends.

05:09.711 --> 05:11.078
That's very sad.

05:11.079 --> 05:15.049
Even that feeling, that'll pass, too.

05:15.050 --> 05:17.651
Okay, now you're just piling on.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.054
Just keep at it.

05:20.055 --> 05:21.918
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning, ma'am.

05:21.919 --> 05:23.090
Great morning.

05:23.091 --> 05:24.458
Is the sand mandala

05:24.459 --> 05:25.962
- ready to rock?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:25.963 --> 05:27.327
Uh, I still don't get the point.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.363
That is the point.

05:29.364 --> 05:31.598
No. Due respect, ma'am,

05:31.599 --> 05:34.234
not getting the point
can't possibly be the point.

05:34.235 --> 05:35.936
You can say that about anything.

05:35.937 --> 05:37.538
Exactly.

05:37.539 --> 05:38.672
Give over, Blake.

05:38.673 --> 05:39.773
Okay, you know,

05:39.774 --> 05:41.277
Buddhism clearly isn't for neurotics.

05:41.278 --> 05:43.077
Or maybe just the opposite.

05:43.078 --> 05:44.578
Look who that is! Come here!

05:44.579 --> 05:47.381
Who is this? Who is this?

05:47.382 --> 05:49.616
Oh, my goodness. This is my girl.

05:49.617 --> 05:51.921
I tell ya, staffers just keep
getting younger and younger,

05:51.922 --> 05:53.253
- don't they?
- Sorry, ma'am.

05:53.254 --> 05:55.757
- The sitter canceled on us last minute.
- Oh, are you kidding?

05:55.758 --> 05:57.524
She keeps me on my toes,
just like her daddy.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.428
Right, little varmint?

05:59.429 --> 06:01.095
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

06:01.096 --> 06:03.230
Secretary Elizabeth McCord.

06:03.231 --> 06:06.867
Ah, so good to see you.

06:06.868 --> 06:09.870
- It's so good to see you.
- You are the kindest of world leaders.

06:09.871 --> 06:13.173
Tall bird lady with lion's heart.

06:13.174 --> 06:16.343
Thank you, Your Holiness.

06:16.344 --> 06:18.946
You remember my assistants,
Lama Samten, Lama Dote

06:18.947 --> 06:20.447
and Geshe Tashi.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.883
You can tell them apart by their auras.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.453
Oh.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.422
- Buddhist humor.
- Oh!

06:30.125 --> 06:31.458
That's... He's... That's...

06:31.459 --> 06:32.693
- He's funny.
- Yeah.

06:32.694 --> 06:36.263
Oh, now, who are you, little sister?

06:36.264 --> 06:39.366
This is Chloe.

06:39.367 --> 06:41.001
- Hello.
- Chloe.

06:41.002 --> 06:42.769
Your Holiness, this...

06:42.770 --> 06:44.771
Whoa!

06:44.772 --> 06:46.673
She is the wisest of us all.

06:47.876 --> 06:49.910
Yes.

06:49.911 --> 06:52.311
Now, where is the sand mandala?

06:53.680 --> 06:56.383
Members of the National Buddhist Center

06:56.384 --> 06:59.353
here in D.C. anticipated your arrival.

06:59.354 --> 07:01.120
Ah.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.297
May you be at peace.

07:10.298 --> 07:12.833
May you be well.

07:12.834 --> 07:15.167
May you find loving kindness.

07:16.537 --> 07:21.707
Let this cosmic Buddha palace
heal and energize the world.

07:23.000 --> 07:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:33.253 --> 07:35.355
May I have some tea?

07:35.356 --> 07:37.858
Of course.

07:37.859 --> 07:39.860
We have a masala chai

07:39.861 --> 07:43.129
that the tea snobs around
here just rave about.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.875
- Hi.
- Sorry about this.

07:54.876 --> 07:56.459
No, it's fine. My mom's coming for her.

07:56.460 --> 07:58.093
- Hi, baby.
- You got her?

07:59.746 --> 08:02.082
I really am trying my best here.

08:02.083 --> 08:05.052
Um, listen, I was gonna give
this to you a little later,

08:05.053 --> 08:07.754
but, uh, it seems appropriate.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.923
It's an informal custody
settlement agreement.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.596
Are you serious?

08:15.597 --> 08:19.366
You... you want sole
physical custody of our child?

08:19.367 --> 08:21.935
I want a routine for Chloe.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.303
Yeah, but what's-what's this?

08:23.304 --> 08:24.571
Can't we just talk about it?

08:24.572 --> 08:27.541
Every time we set a
schedule, something comes up,

08:27.542 --> 08:29.276
and she and I end up ping-ponging

08:29.277 --> 08:30.978
between offices and departments,

08:30.979 --> 08:33.246
and we cannot keep doing that.

08:33.248 --> 08:35.048
And my lawyer friend says

08:35.049 --> 08:37.384
it's a, uh, it's a standard arrangement.

08:37.385 --> 08:40.287
One day a week, every other weekend,

08:40.288 --> 08:42.722
and-and then we can discuss holidays.

08:42.724 --> 08:45.826
What happened to
working on the marriage?

08:45.827 --> 08:46.994
My lawyer friend.

08:46.995 --> 08:48.829
And we still need a custody agreement

08:48.830 --> 08:50.550
- while we're working on the marriage.
- No.

08:50.551 --> 08:52.991
I do not accept this. You don't
get to dictate the terms here.

08:52.992 --> 08:53.863
Shh. Okay.

08:53.864 --> 08:54.635
Okay.

08:54.636 --> 08:56.637
We should just talk about this later.

08:56.638 --> 08:58.138
I'm sorry.

08:58.139 --> 09:00.874
I thought you would understand.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.775
Say good-bye to Daddy.

09:06.013 --> 09:06.980
Good girl.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.448
I'll see you soon, okay, honey?

09:08.449 --> 09:09.816
See you later.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.417
Come on.

09:18.225 --> 09:22.062
I must request your help
with a rather serious matter.

09:22.063 --> 09:23.864
Your Holiness, you know I...

09:23.865 --> 09:25.565
I can't discuss statecraft with you.

09:25.566 --> 09:26.800
I'm terminal.

09:26.801 --> 09:29.068
Pancreatic cancer.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.506
I'm so sorry.

09:32.507 --> 09:35.141
Everyone must die.

09:36.777 --> 09:39.413
I have aligned my life to my purpose:

09:39.414 --> 09:42.182
to fight for the autonomy
of the Tibetan people.

09:42.183 --> 09:43.684
And as for them,

09:43.685 --> 09:49.122
I ask that you endorse my choice
for my successor over China's.

09:49.123 --> 09:51.591
Well, as always...

09:51.592 --> 09:55.295
the United States encourages
you to achieve your goal

09:55.296 --> 09:57.597
through direct dialogue with China.

09:57.598 --> 10:00.734
When I die, the Tibetans will lose

10:00.735 --> 10:04.037
their loudest voice in this world.

10:04.038 --> 10:06.440
China will be emboldened

10:06.441 --> 10:09.242
to trample even more of our rights.

10:09.243 --> 10:13.113
U.S. policy is clear.

10:13.114 --> 10:16.283
We are officially neutral on this issue.

10:16.284 --> 10:19.718
I die knowing that I've done
everything I can for my people.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.591
I have no regrets, Elizabeth.

10:24.592 --> 10:27.060
Do you?

10:27.061 --> 10:29.196
Of course I have regrets.

10:29.197 --> 10:30.764
How could I not?

10:30.765 --> 10:32.866
It was a rhetorical question, babe.

10:32.867 --> 10:34.101
And now he's dying.

10:34.102 --> 10:38.472
And I feel terrible about that.

10:38.473 --> 10:40.741
And I feel guilty about Tibet.

10:40.742 --> 10:44.044
Like, now it's all on me, but I...

10:44.045 --> 10:47.881
we're too... enmeshed with China,

10:47.882 --> 10:49.850
especially with this climate deal,

10:49.851 --> 10:51.818
to offend them over a battle

10:51.819 --> 10:54.321
they've-they've mostly won, right?

10:54.322 --> 10:56.390
I mean...

10:56.391 --> 11:00.060
Thoughts from the world
renowned religious scholar?

11:00.061 --> 11:02.996
I guess I'm preoccupied
with my own regrets.

11:02.997 --> 11:05.399
Uh, not just that the office shut down.

11:05.400 --> 11:06.900
The bomb's still out there,

11:06.901 --> 11:08.301
to say nothing of the drone.

11:08.302 --> 11:09.736
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. I...

11:09.737 --> 11:11.338
It's okay.

11:11.339 --> 11:14.775
Just... stop hogging all
the self-flagellation.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.716
Hello.

11:22.717 --> 11:25.819
Sorry to bother you, ma'am,
but are you watching the news?

11:25.820 --> 11:28.053
I'll turn it on.

11:29.990 --> 11:31.391
...announcement.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.175
Breaking with hundreds
of years of tradition,

11:33.176 --> 11:36.696
the Dalai Lama named his
successor while still alive.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.866
Gaden Bhuti, a two-year-old
Tibetan-American boy

11:39.867 --> 11:43.870
from Delaware, son to immigrants
Yonten and Sonam Bhuti...

11:43.871 --> 11:46.306
Didn't see that coming.

11:46.307 --> 11:49.676
Please tell me this boy isn't
an American citizen, Jay.

11:49.677 --> 11:50.977
Wish I could,

11:50.978 --> 11:52.579
but if we let him keep his citizenship

11:52.580 --> 11:54.414
or leave the country to
take his new position,

11:54.415 --> 11:57.050
the Chinese will accuse us
of backing the Tibetan cause.

11:57.051 --> 11:59.553
Well, you got to hand it to the Lama.

11:59.554 --> 12:01.755
He figured out a way to force our hand.

12:01.756 --> 12:04.024
China will make a meal of this.

12:04.025 --> 12:06.760
Yeah, and the appetizer
will be our climate deal.

12:06.761 --> 12:08.662
Hang on, Jay.

12:08.663 --> 12:10.931
I have peace and light
on the other line.

12:10.932 --> 12:12.731
I got to call you back.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.403
Namaste, Russell.

12:16.404 --> 12:17.938
You watching this?!

12:17.939 --> 12:18.939
Y... Yes.

12:18.940 --> 12:20.941
Where did he get this bright idea?

12:20.942 --> 12:24.211
What the hell did you say to the Lama?!

12:25.837 --> 12:31.849
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#33FF00"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#33FF00"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

12:38.076 --> 12:43.041
Mr. Chen, the United States
will not officially endorse

12:43.042 --> 12:45.244
any new Lama; you have my word.

12:45.245 --> 12:47.112
How generous, Madam Secretary,

12:47.113 --> 12:49.147
but the People's Republic needs you

12:49.148 --> 12:51.149
to publicly disavow this choice.

12:51.150 --> 12:53.819
You know we can't do that.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.788
Not endorsing maintains

12:56.789 --> 12:58.624
our neutrality.

12:58.625 --> 13:01.860
If the Dalai Lama is an
American, then by definition,

13:01.861 --> 13:03.428
that's not neutral.

13:03.429 --> 13:06.832
It's the United States harboring
an anti-China instigator.

13:06.833 --> 13:09.768
Ming, the boy is two.

13:09.769 --> 13:13.238
I think your way of life will survive.

13:13.239 --> 13:17.009
Symbols are often more
potent than armies, Elizabeth.

13:17.010 --> 13:19.177
Change your position,
or I will make sure

13:19.178 --> 13:21.313
the National People's
Congress Standing Committee

13:21.314 --> 13:23.682
never considers the Stockholm
Protocols for approval.

13:23.683 --> 13:27.753
Are you really going to hold
the world hostage over a symbol,

13:27.754 --> 13:31.123
who's probably not even potty-trained?

13:31.124 --> 13:33.591
I believe my position is clear.

13:34.326 --> 13:36.561
To hell with the cooling-off period.

13:36.562 --> 13:38.797
I want to look at
officially naming China

13:38.798 --> 13:40.132
a currency manipulator.

13:40.133 --> 13:44.136
Even hinting at that will
be considered aggressive.

13:44.137 --> 13:46.104
Look, whether we like it or not,

13:46.105 --> 13:48.874
Tibet is a symbol of
nationalism in China.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.310
And the Dalai Lama
personifies the last vestiges

13:51.311 --> 13:53.378
of Tibetan independence.

13:53.379 --> 13:56.214
So let China look tough for a few days,

13:56.215 --> 13:58.850
and I bet that they will
quietly ratify the protocols.

13:59.986 --> 14:01.420
Well, forget the Chinese.

14:01.421 --> 14:03.722
Now we're taking fire

14:03.723 --> 14:05.023
from our own flank.

14:05.024 --> 14:06.158
Chandler Morton,

14:06.159 --> 14:08.182
the distinguished junior
senator from Pennsylvania,

14:08.183 --> 14:10.529
just did a lap of the morning shows

14:10.530 --> 14:13.699
to express his ardent
support for the Dalai Lama

14:13.700 --> 14:15.701
and his American successor.

14:15.702 --> 14:19.071
Senator Dumbass even
invited the Lama to address

14:19.072 --> 14:21.015
the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee next week.

14:21.016 --> 14:23.075
Why jeopardize the climate deal?

14:23.076 --> 14:25.177
Morton's on record as a supporter.

14:25.178 --> 14:28.146
The Dalai Lama's announcement
last night broke the Internet.

14:28.147 --> 14:31.383
The public moved on from sad polar bears

14:31.384 --> 14:33.185
to cute baby saviors.

14:33.186 --> 14:35.987
The senator's just chasing that
narrative to boost his profile.

14:35.988 --> 14:37.689
Well, regardless of his motive,

14:37.690 --> 14:40.459
we still need to show China
we take this seriously.

14:40.460 --> 14:43.562
Chen won't accept a condemnation.

14:43.563 --> 14:46.365
Morton will have to back down.

14:46.366 --> 14:48.066
Hit 'em where it hurts, sir.

14:48.067 --> 14:50.836
Threaten to withdraw
support from your donor list.

14:50.837 --> 14:53.472
And we provoke him, it
could blow up in our face.

14:53.473 --> 14:55.040
Look, let me find

14:55.041 --> 14:58.143
a carrot to entice the good senator.

14:58.144 --> 14:59.378
You want to reward this punk?

14:59.379 --> 15:02.481
If we can quietly get
him off his high horse,

15:02.482 --> 15:05.751
then I will have something
to point to when I talk

15:05.752 --> 15:07.285
the Chinese off theirs.

15:07.286 --> 15:08.953
Do it, Bess.

15:13.259 --> 15:15.060
Rewarding bad behavior it is.

15:22.200 --> 15:23.935
Nadine,

15:23.936 --> 15:25.837
do you still play

15:25.838 --> 15:28.273
in that monthly Hill
leadership poker game?

15:28.274 --> 15:31.410
I consider it my pension fund.

15:31.411 --> 15:34.980
You ever clean out anyone from
the Pennsylvania delegation?

15:34.981 --> 15:38.984
Well, it's a friendly game.

15:38.985 --> 15:42.954
Are you looking for
leverage on Senator Morton?

15:42.955 --> 15:44.890
I just wanted to...

15:44.891 --> 15:48.193
offer him some alternative paths

15:48.194 --> 15:51.797
to the attention he seeks.

15:51.798 --> 15:53.532
I'll find something.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.332
Thank you.

15:59.104 --> 16:00.205
Hey.

16:00.206 --> 16:02.007
Hey.

16:02.008 --> 16:03.408
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

16:03.409 --> 16:04.709
I got to be quick.

16:04.710 --> 16:05.977
Ever since Wayne disappeared,

16:05.978 --> 16:08.113
they've got us on even tighter lockdown.

16:08.114 --> 16:10.549
Does the Council of
Elders suspect foul play?

16:10.550 --> 16:12.617
Yeah, of course. They
got conspiracy theories

16:12.618 --> 16:15.153
on why certain squirrels
show up when they do.

16:15.154 --> 16:18.056
Since Wayne's disappearance
is an actual mystery,

16:18.057 --> 16:20.192
they're going nuts; I
swear they're watching me.

16:20.193 --> 16:21.460
Can you hang on

16:21.461 --> 16:23.228
for another 72 hours?

16:23.229 --> 16:25.697
HQ shutting it down?

16:25.698 --> 16:27.532
Got to release Wayne's body.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.000
So we need you to focus

16:29.001 --> 16:30.969
on collecting significant Intel now.

16:30.970 --> 16:33.171
We'll raid camp after we extract you.

16:33.172 --> 16:35.740
I don't have any significant Intel.

16:35.741 --> 16:37.342
I haven't seen the bomb.

16:37.343 --> 16:39.411
After Wayne, they moved the drone.

16:42.848 --> 16:44.816
You're gonna have to
wear another camera.

16:44.817 --> 16:46.680
At the very least, it'll
help us plan the raid.

16:46.681 --> 16:47.853
Uh, did you not hear me?

16:47.854 --> 16:49.120
They already think I'm shady.

16:49.121 --> 16:50.655
If they see that thing,
they're gonna kill me.

16:50.656 --> 16:53.639
- They sweep the camp every day...
- Okay, listen, I know what the risk is,

16:53.640 --> 16:55.183
but remember, we're trying to keep VFF

16:55.184 --> 16:56.862
from committing mass murder.

16:56.863 --> 16:58.497
All the work you've done,

16:58.498 --> 17:00.899
Wayne's death, it means nothing

17:00.900 --> 17:04.536
unless we get enough
information before we go in.

17:04.537 --> 17:07.305
Look, if you're not up for it...

17:07.306 --> 17:09.607
I can bring you in right now.

17:11.276 --> 17:12.911
I'm fine.

17:12.912 --> 17:14.079
I should go.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.713
Okay.

17:17.048 --> 17:19.650
See you in 72 hours.

17:31.563 --> 17:33.431
Ben. Hey.

17:33.432 --> 17:35.400
- Thanks for this.
- Hey, I'm always happy

17:35.401 --> 17:38.036
to dispense legal advice when
it's paired with a free steak.

17:38.037 --> 17:40.605
Could we actually do
something quicker? Work is...

17:40.606 --> 17:42.541
Oh, yeah, I read about the Lama thing.

17:42.542 --> 17:44.309
Uh, whatever you want, man.

17:52.751 --> 17:54.119
So, what can I do?

17:54.120 --> 17:56.821
You mean if reasoning with her fails?

17:56.822 --> 18:00.158
You have to play the game you're in.

18:00.159 --> 18:03.995
Hardball. Use anything you can
to make her look less optimal.

18:03.996 --> 18:07.232
Didn't you say she went
through some postpartum stuff?

18:07.233 --> 18:09.234
Do not go there, man.

18:09.235 --> 18:11.670
I didn't say it was pretty.

18:11.671 --> 18:13.638
Ma'am, I did the recon.

18:13.639 --> 18:16.207
Senator Morton's chief
professional passion

18:16.208 --> 18:20.345
is lobbying the FCC to
approve a telecom merger.

18:20.346 --> 18:24.416
But he does have pretty
powerful motivation

18:24.417 --> 18:27.719
for supporting an American Lama.

18:27.720 --> 18:30.320
I'll let my source tell you.

18:36.761 --> 18:40.065
You play poker with the
vice president, Nadine?

18:40.066 --> 18:42.167
I cashed in my chips
when I took this gig.

18:42.168 --> 18:43.769
- How are you?
- Hi, Teresa. How are you?

18:43.770 --> 18:45.471
So good to see you.
Come, please, sit down.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.539
Uh, yes, well, it was just as well,

18:47.540 --> 18:50.642
because Nadine is a shark.

18:50.643 --> 18:53.411
Teresa was gracious enough
to take my call anyway.

18:53.412 --> 18:54.713
What better source

18:54.714 --> 18:56.281
on Morton than his predecessor?

18:56.282 --> 18:57.983
I wish I had better news.

18:57.984 --> 19:00.852
Morton's untimely
pursuit of Tibetan freedom

19:00.853 --> 19:03.154
has particularly craven motives.

19:03.155 --> 19:05.890
His biggest donor is Gration Tech,

19:05.891 --> 19:07.826
manufacturer of heavy machinery.

19:07.827 --> 19:09.260
They make almost half

19:09.261 --> 19:11.262
their revenue from hydraulic valve parts

19:11.263 --> 19:12.631
crucial to coal mining.

19:12.632 --> 19:15.367
An industry that would
take an enormous hit

19:15.368 --> 19:17.836
if the Stockholm
Protocols were ratified.

19:17.837 --> 19:19.620
Ma'am, I just got word
from our India desk...

19:19.621 --> 19:22.540
Oh, Madam Vice President,
hi. Sorry to interrupt.

19:22.541 --> 19:24.175
No worries. It's good to see you, Jay.

19:24.176 --> 19:27.178
India wants to reopen
the Stockholm Protocols.

19:27.179 --> 19:29.781
They're demanding a reduction
on all coal restrictions.

19:29.782 --> 19:32.217
They're clearly reacting
to China wavering.

19:32.218 --> 19:34.285
That and growing protests

19:34.286 --> 19:35.954
in Delhi and Mumbai over the prospect

19:35.955 --> 19:37.389
of rising electricity costs.

19:37.390 --> 19:40.392
Well, with India bailing,
China is even less likely

19:40.393 --> 19:42.527
to ratify the climate deal.

19:42.528 --> 19:46.665
And we have our own senator
to thank for blowing it up.

19:46.666 --> 19:48.532
Wow.

19:55.830 --> 19:59.072
So Morton is trying to spike the
deal to help one of his donors,

19:59.073 --> 20:02.025
but he's hiding behind
the feel-good issue

20:02.026 --> 20:03.243
of Tibetan independence.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.311
That's my assessment, sir, yes.

20:05.312 --> 20:08.865
You staked your second term
on taking meaningful action

20:08.866 --> 20:10.333
on climate change.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.535
If this deal falls apart,

20:12.536 --> 20:15.054
the enemy smells weakness,
works that much harder

20:15.055 --> 20:17.773
to deny any of your other priorities.

20:19.376 --> 20:21.210
Why did I want this job again?

20:21.211 --> 20:23.880
Your house does have a
bowling alley in the basement.

20:23.881 --> 20:26.466
So no one will care

20:26.467 --> 20:30.136
that Morton puts his donors' priorities

20:30.137 --> 20:33.273
ahead of the nation's,
I mean, of-of the world?

20:33.274 --> 20:35.808
Yeah. No one will care.

20:35.809 --> 20:38.194
We need to stop the bleeding.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.897
Get India back on board,
Morton back in line,

20:40.898 --> 20:43.733
before every other hack in
the Senate puts his hand out

20:43.734 --> 20:45.735
and our own side falls apart.

20:45.736 --> 20:48.121
Well, I can handle
the India inducements.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.907
As for Morton...

20:50.908 --> 20:54.911
I rescind my earlier
concerns about provoking him.

20:54.912 --> 20:58.213
I think we all know
what needs to happen.

21:01.251 --> 21:03.586
We've been watching
Ian's feed for hours,

21:03.587 --> 21:07.390
with no new sign of evidence.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.342
On the other hand,
they haven't killed him.

21:09.343 --> 21:12.095
Yet.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.479
Our dead friend Wayne O'Connell's

21:13.480 --> 21:15.431
been out of pocket for days now.

21:15.432 --> 21:17.684
Ian's the new guy; they
got to be looking at him.

21:17.685 --> 21:19.352
Yeah, but if we pull him now,

21:19.353 --> 21:22.822
there's no way we'll find the bomb.

21:22.823 --> 21:25.858
Unless...

21:25.859 --> 21:28.244
we release O'Connell's
body to his family

21:28.245 --> 21:30.580
without telling the
details of his death.

21:30.581 --> 21:32.031
Whoa.

21:32.032 --> 21:35.418
That's a surprising notion
coming from an ethics professor.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.453
Could take the heat off Ian.

21:37.454 --> 21:39.672
Buy him some time to find the bomb.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.890
Can you live with that?

21:53.854 --> 21:56.139
I'm so sorry I forgot to give you this.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.808
Was Chloe up all night?

21:58.809 --> 22:00.193
Thank you.

22:00.194 --> 22:01.894
Hey, I said I'm sorry.

22:01.895 --> 22:04.781
How could you go to the guy
who officiated our wedding

22:04.782 --> 22:05.732
for legal advice?

22:05.733 --> 22:08.201
What about your lawyer friend?

22:08.202 --> 22:11.154
Someone from yoga who
downloaded a form for me.

22:11.155 --> 22:13.239
I didn't seek her advice,
and she didn't marry us.

22:13.240 --> 22:14.957
Well, I'm allowed to know my rights.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.577
You really want to fight me in
court for the right to leave her

22:17.578 --> 22:19.746
with a babysitter in your
apartment half the time?

22:19.747 --> 22:21.464
Who does that serve, Jay?

22:21.465 --> 22:23.383
And you can't seriously think

22:23.384 --> 22:25.885
that you would be a better
custodial parent to Chloe.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.087
I practically was her
only parent for six months

22:28.088 --> 22:29.991
when you couldn't get
out of bed. Remember that?

22:29.992 --> 22:31.642
Because I sure as hell do!

22:37.681 --> 22:39.432
Prime Minister Verma,

22:39.433 --> 22:42.485
let me start by saying that I am open

22:42.486 --> 22:44.854
to taking a second look

22:44.855 --> 22:46.406
at some of the protocols.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.274
Since India will sacrifice the most,

22:48.275 --> 22:49.692
we believe it's only fair.

22:49.693 --> 22:52.528
Just none that increase coal emissions.

22:52.529 --> 22:53.996
Ah.

22:53.997 --> 22:56.532
The rich Western nation
built on coal tells

22:56.533 --> 22:59.752
the emerging market, "It's
okay when we polluted.

22:59.753 --> 23:02.004
You find a new way."

23:02.005 --> 23:03.623
A classic.

23:03.624 --> 23:06.292
Look, I get it.

23:06.293 --> 23:08.211
You promised to bring electricity

23:08.212 --> 23:11.631
to the 300 million Indians
who live without it,

23:11.632 --> 23:13.683
and you think loosening
coal restrictions

23:13.684 --> 23:14.884
will help you deliver.

23:14.885 --> 23:16.102
And it will.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.721
We have lots of people
in India and lots of coal.

23:18.722 --> 23:20.440
It's not a complicated equation.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.859
But the majority of
those without electricity

23:22.860 --> 23:24.777
live in remote rural areas,

23:24.778 --> 23:26.362
far from any kind of grid.

23:26.363 --> 23:27.647
Indeed. I'm well aware of that.

23:27.648 --> 23:30.783
So let's find that new way together.

23:30.784 --> 23:35.705
Return to the deal as is,
and the U.S. will subsidize

23:35.706 --> 23:37.406
a mass scale lo-fi alternative:

23:37.407 --> 23:39.575
bottom-up, solar mini grid efforts

23:39.576 --> 23:41.160
to rural areas.

23:41.161 --> 23:43.713
Get the Chinese to
resuscitate the protocols,

23:43.714 --> 23:45.715
along with this new amendment,

23:45.716 --> 23:47.917
we could be amenable.

23:49.086 --> 23:50.503
I told POTUS

23:50.504 --> 23:52.889
what this telecom merger
would mean for Pennsylvania.

23:52.890 --> 23:54.891
A thumbs-up could push it over the top,

23:54.892 --> 23:56.259
really put you on the map.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.593
Good luck, Senator.

23:57.594 --> 23:59.011
You're not coming?

23:59.012 --> 24:00.847
Oh, no, no, no. The
president wanted to keep

24:00.848 --> 24:03.483
this meeting top
tier... just one and two.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.852
Number five. Didn't make the cut.

24:05.853 --> 24:09.371
Let's not keep the leader
of the free world waiting.

24:11.158 --> 24:12.575
Senator Morton,

24:12.576 --> 24:15.435
are you familiar with
the migratory pattern

24:15.436 --> 24:17.437
of the osprey?

24:17.438 --> 24:20.106
Um, no, sir.

24:20.107 --> 24:24.444
They winter in South America,
then travel up to 5,000 miles

24:24.445 --> 24:27.113
to their North American
breeding grounds.

24:27.114 --> 24:30.466
They settle here to eat
fish from the Potomac.

24:33.621 --> 24:37.174
I saw a few my first year, but...

24:37.175 --> 24:40.377
not many since.

24:40.378 --> 24:43.479
My grandchildren, well...

24:45.132 --> 24:47.467
...they may never see an osprey at all.

24:47.468 --> 24:49.886
That's what scientists call

24:49.887 --> 24:51.638
shifting baseline syndrome.

24:51.639 --> 24:55.475
Each generation accepts their
version of nature, plunders it,

24:55.476 --> 24:59.396
then leaves the next generation
to accept the depleted version,

24:59.397 --> 25:01.982
and so on.

25:01.983 --> 25:04.201
Which brings me to us.

25:04.202 --> 25:06.036
Now.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.753
You.

25:09.957 --> 25:12.993
Mr. President, I'm here
about the telecom deal.

25:12.994 --> 25:14.828
We'll get to that in a minute.

25:14.829 --> 25:17.497
I know you're killing my climate
deal to appease your donor.

25:17.498 --> 25:18.748
Who is it again, uh,

25:18.749 --> 25:20.634
Gration Technologies?

25:20.635 --> 25:22.836
All due respect, sir,
your sources don't know

25:22.837 --> 25:23.940
what they're talking about.

25:23.941 --> 25:26.890
I'm his source, Chandler.

25:26.891 --> 25:29.309
Your telecom merger is up for review

25:29.310 --> 25:31.061
in two weeks.

25:31.062 --> 25:34.514
It, uh, rides the line
on antitrust issues,

25:34.515 --> 25:36.149
on what's proper and not.

25:36.150 --> 25:38.518
Shifting baseline syndrome.

25:38.519 --> 25:40.604
It's everywhere these days.

25:40.605 --> 25:42.772
Point is,

25:42.773 --> 25:46.109
I can choose to become
troubled by those issues.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.277
Or not.

25:47.278 --> 25:50.247
So do the right thing.

25:50.248 --> 25:52.415
Don't screw up the climate deal

25:52.416 --> 25:54.367
that a majority of Americans support,

25:54.368 --> 25:57.704
including your constituents.

25:57.705 --> 25:59.605
Or I will kick your ass.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.231
Welcome to Washington, Senator.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.388
I received your
inducements, Madam Secretary.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.791
All very generous.

26:40.792 --> 26:44.254
But we cannot accept as long
as your government endorses

26:44.255 --> 26:45.472
the American Lama.

26:45.473 --> 26:48.341
And that's why I'm glad to report

26:48.342 --> 26:51.227
that Senator Morton
had a change of heart.

26:51.228 --> 26:53.847
We reaffirm our neutrality.

26:53.848 --> 26:57.851
A government with conflicting opinions.

26:57.852 --> 27:00.620
I will never understand democracy.

27:00.621 --> 27:02.188
Well, you say "tomato,"

27:02.189 --> 27:04.791
I say "let's ratify our climate deal."

27:04.792 --> 27:06.526
Okay? We'll resubmit the protocols

27:06.527 --> 27:08.194
with a new addendum

27:08.195 --> 27:09.612
for Indian solar funding.

27:09.613 --> 27:11.948
Everybody's happy. Planet saved.

27:11.949 --> 27:13.033
Thank you.

27:13.034 --> 27:14.834
There's just one more matter to settle.

27:14.835 --> 27:16.503
Really?

27:16.504 --> 27:18.038
Chinese Buddhist scholars

27:18.039 --> 27:20.924
have found the Dalai
Lama's true reincarnation.

27:20.925 --> 27:23.793
A two-year-old boy in Sichuan Province.

27:23.794 --> 27:25.378
If you officially recognize him,

27:25.379 --> 27:27.180
we will gladly have
the Standing Committee

27:27.181 --> 27:29.015
consider the protocols

27:29.016 --> 27:30.300
for ratification.

27:30.301 --> 27:32.602
Ming, we-we support

27:32.603 --> 27:36.139
the PRC's right to recognize
this boy as the next Lama.

27:36.140 --> 27:38.975
Just as we support
Tibet's right to recognize

27:38.976 --> 27:40.193
their own boy.

27:40.194 --> 27:41.561
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

27:41.562 --> 27:45.231
Disqualify the American
Lama or recognize ours.

27:45.232 --> 27:48.318
Otherwise, no deal.

27:48.319 --> 27:50.904
Do you know the mountains
that President Dalton and I

27:50.905 --> 27:52.956
had to move to put
this deal back together?

27:52.957 --> 27:55.041
All to do what's best for our children

27:55.042 --> 27:56.876
and grandchildren... oh, and the other

27:56.877 --> 27:59.462
seven billion people on the planet, too.

27:59.463 --> 28:02.549
But... And you are
putting it all on the line,

28:02.550 --> 28:04.667
trying to strong-arm us

28:04.668 --> 28:07.754
into endorsing some
toddler that you are using

28:07.755 --> 28:10.173
as a political pawn!

28:10.174 --> 28:13.259
Do... You know who the
real toddler is, Ming?

28:13.260 --> 28:14.644
You.

28:14.645 --> 28:16.463
You're the real toddler. You are.

28:21.435 --> 28:23.186
Well, that happened.

28:23.187 --> 28:26.288
Yes, it most certainly did.

28:27.691 --> 28:30.410
Are you going to see
the Bhuti family today?

28:30.411 --> 28:32.862
In a few minutes, actually.

28:32.863 --> 28:36.783
Uh, would you like
us to try to talk them

28:36.784 --> 28:39.619
out of letting their
child do the Lama tests?

28:39.620 --> 28:40.754
No.

28:40.755 --> 28:44.424
We are not putting
our thumb on the scale.

28:44.425 --> 28:48.294
Let's just hope the universe...

28:48.295 --> 28:50.630
gives us a break.

28:50.631 --> 28:51.952
The Chinese officials said

28:51.953 --> 28:53.336
you will take away our citizenship

28:53.337 --> 28:54.851
if we let Gaden study as a monk.

28:54.852 --> 28:56.315
Oh, no, the State Department

28:56.316 --> 28:57.720
would never do that.

28:57.721 --> 28:59.889
They were just trying to intimidate you.

28:59.890 --> 29:02.525
We heard the Chinese stopped
the climate deal over of our son.

29:02.526 --> 29:04.978
How do we know you won't
try to pressure us in order

29:04.979 --> 29:06.842
- to make your deal?
- Well, of course,

29:06.843 --> 29:09.566
American government has policy concerns.

29:09.567 --> 29:13.344
But it is not our place
to try to influence you.

29:14.822 --> 29:16.489
It is a difficult decision.

29:16.490 --> 29:18.541
If your child was chosen
to enlighten all people...

29:18.542 --> 29:20.043
And to save your home...

29:20.044 --> 29:21.327
Shouldn't you let him?

29:21.328 --> 29:22.579
So you're actually considering

29:22.580 --> 29:24.283
giving up your child
to be raised by monks?

29:24.284 --> 29:26.666
Which is your choice.

29:26.667 --> 29:28.668
But, effectively, you'd
be choosing to abandon him.

29:28.669 --> 29:30.185
You know that, right?

29:33.424 --> 29:35.691
Excuse me.

29:36.727 --> 29:38.928
You want to tell me
what happened in there?

29:38.929 --> 29:43.349
Abby wants full custody of
Chloe and won't give me an inch.

29:43.350 --> 29:47.403
It's gotten... pretty nasty.

29:50.191 --> 29:51.774
I'm sorry.

29:51.775 --> 29:54.027
Me, too.

29:54.028 --> 29:56.696
You know, I went
through something similar

29:56.697 --> 29:59.365
with my son, Roman.

29:59.366 --> 30:01.633
Um...

30:03.704 --> 30:06.039
His father and I weren't married.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.958
And he wanted nothing to do with us,

30:08.959 --> 30:11.211
until Roman turned eight.

30:11.212 --> 30:13.513
And then he asked for a relationship.

30:13.514 --> 30:15.682
I think I resented

30:15.683 --> 30:18.968
the whole "prodigal father
returning for the fun stuff"

30:18.969 --> 30:21.554
after I'd done all the heavy lifting.

30:21.555 --> 30:26.976
And I knew he didn't have
money to take me to court, so...

30:26.977 --> 30:30.396
I boxed him out.

30:30.397 --> 30:34.200
And then one day, I was
cleaning out Roman's backpack,

30:34.201 --> 30:37.737
and I found the announcement
for the father-son camping trip

30:37.738 --> 30:40.657
at his school.

30:40.658 --> 30:42.542
It was torn into pieces.

30:42.543 --> 30:45.879
That's when I realized who was really

30:45.880 --> 30:48.513
going to be picking up the tab.

30:50.668 --> 30:52.969
What's the status at the crash site?

30:52.970 --> 30:56.172
Placed an anonymous
call over an hour ago.

30:56.173 --> 30:59.142
Highway Patrol should
be there any minute.

30:59.143 --> 31:00.643
With any luck...

31:03.430 --> 31:05.815
...they rule Wayne's death accidental.

31:05.816 --> 31:08.151
We just have to make
sure VFF gets the word

31:08.152 --> 31:09.269
and buys the story.

31:09.270 --> 31:10.653
Yeah.

31:10.654 --> 31:13.773
Okay. Call me the minute
you get a ping from Ian.

31:13.774 --> 31:15.024
You all right?

31:15.025 --> 31:17.110
No, not really.

31:17.111 --> 31:19.711
You know, my asset.

31:21.115 --> 31:23.249
How 'bout you?

31:23.250 --> 31:27.370
Well, I just heard that the
Lama's been hospitalized.

31:27.371 --> 31:29.622
Likely the beginning of the end.

31:29.623 --> 31:30.757
I'm sorry.

31:30.758 --> 31:33.092
Well, I got to deal with how his passing

31:33.093 --> 31:34.711
is gonna affect the planet.

31:34.712 --> 31:38.798
China's playing with global catastrophe,

31:38.799 --> 31:41.801
and no one knows yet whether
Gaden Bhuti will pass the test

31:41.802 --> 31:43.770
and be the next Lama or not.

31:43.771 --> 31:46.806
There's no way to influence the outcome?

31:46.807 --> 31:48.391
You mean...

31:48.392 --> 31:51.227
by doing something brazenly unethical?

31:51.228 --> 31:52.779
Are you okay? Really?

31:52.780 --> 31:53.532
You have a fever?

31:53.533 --> 31:55.481
I just have been
suggesting a lot of things

31:55.482 --> 31:56.649
that aren't me lately.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.401
Well, I'm right here.

31:58.402 --> 32:00.903
You know, sometimes those Lama tests

32:00.904 --> 32:03.239
can take years to initiate.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.624
Great.

32:04.625 --> 32:07.076
Then it won't matter
whether he's the Lama or not,

32:07.077 --> 32:08.995
because the planet can't wait.

32:08.996 --> 32:11.346
There's-there's no time.

32:12.833 --> 32:16.636
Maybe you can't put
your thumb on the scale.

32:16.637 --> 32:19.571
How 'bout you put your foot on the gas?

32:24.845 --> 32:27.397
Transition team to O.R. 3.

32:27.398 --> 32:28.348
Ma'am.

32:28.349 --> 32:29.915
Transition team to O.R. 3.

32:30.651 --> 32:32.268
Ah, Elizabeth.

32:32.269 --> 32:34.237
I brought you these.

32:34.238 --> 32:36.072
Ah.

32:36.073 --> 32:39.442
How very kind, Elizabeth.

32:39.443 --> 32:41.527
If you want to say something,

32:41.528 --> 32:44.030
there's no better time than now.

32:44.031 --> 32:46.416
I-I've been thinking

32:46.417 --> 32:49.869
about how, for Buddhists,

32:49.870 --> 32:53.172
clinging is the root of suffering.

32:53.173 --> 32:56.709
Well, I understand that now,

32:56.710 --> 33:00.463
because I have been clinging

33:00.464 --> 33:04.100
to ensuring a future for our planet

33:04.101 --> 33:06.653
and its people.

33:08.222 --> 33:10.690
This may even be my purpose.

33:10.691 --> 33:14.644
That is a worthy purpose.

33:14.645 --> 33:17.530
But the trouble is...

33:17.531 --> 33:20.733
our purposes are at odds.

33:20.734 --> 33:24.320
If Gaden Bhuti is the
Lama, Tibet has a leader.

33:24.321 --> 33:28.658
But the Chinese will not
ratify your climate deal.

33:28.659 --> 33:31.077
And by 2050,

33:31.078 --> 33:35.715
200 million people in your region

33:35.716 --> 33:39.168
will face losing their homes and lives

33:39.169 --> 33:42.004
from the melting Himalayan glacier.

33:42.005 --> 33:45.591
And once gone, so will
be the water supply

33:45.592 --> 33:48.261
to the Indian seat of your
own government in exile.

33:48.262 --> 33:50.263
But if

33:50.264 --> 33:54.067
Gaden Bhuti is not the Lama...

33:54.068 --> 33:58.488
If the tests take years,

33:58.489 --> 34:00.440
it won't matter.

34:03.660 --> 34:06.662
What do you ask of me, Elizabeth?

34:06.663 --> 34:09.031
Give my purpose fair footing.

34:09.032 --> 34:11.117
Test the American child now.

34:11.118 --> 34:13.953
We'll accept the results...

34:13.954 --> 34:16.271
then go from there.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.252
Jay, what are you doing here?

34:32.253 --> 34:33.646
You cannot ambush me like this.

34:33.647 --> 34:35.213
Don't worry. I come in peace.

34:36.900 --> 34:39.985
So, I just spent the week watching Tibet

34:39.987 --> 34:41.737
and China fight over a two-year-old

34:41.737 --> 34:43.789
who may or may not be the reincarnation

34:43.790 --> 34:45.875
of the Bodhisattva of compassion.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.244
I know. I read about it. It's crazy.

34:48.245 --> 34:51.464
He's this avatar

34:51.465 --> 34:55.251
for everyone's hopes
and fears, even mine.

34:55.252 --> 34:56.418
I'm clinging to Chloe

34:56.420 --> 34:58.588
like she's the last
mooring of the life I knew,

34:58.589 --> 35:02.273
the life that I... that
I thought made sense to me.

35:04.061 --> 35:06.646
You're a wonderful mother.

35:06.647 --> 35:09.414
And I'm a present and loving dad...

35:10.183 --> 35:12.268
...when I'm around.

35:12.269 --> 35:14.687
I'm gonna work on doing more of that.

35:14.688 --> 35:17.323
But the main thing is,
no matter what choices

35:17.324 --> 35:20.493
that we're making in our lives
right now, she didn't choose it.

35:20.494 --> 35:24.246
She deserves parents who respect
each other and put her first,

35:24.247 --> 35:26.415
and I just... I just
want to focus on that.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.251
So...

35:29.252 --> 35:31.203
I'm saying yes

35:31.204 --> 35:33.172
to your agreement.

35:33.173 --> 35:37.559
Chloe needs stability more
than I need... anything.

35:38.512 --> 35:41.180
But I hope we can keep
talking about it, though.

35:41.181 --> 35:42.465
Things can change.

35:42.466 --> 35:43.966
I could get fired.

35:43.967 --> 35:47.186
And then I'm coming after
her with everything I've got.

35:47.187 --> 35:50.288
Yeah, of course we can
keep talking about it.

35:52.726 --> 35:58.413
I want Chloe to think that
her dad is the greatest.

36:09.826 --> 36:11.827
So, the Dalai Lama's representatives

36:11.828 --> 36:13.663
are set to meet him today?

36:13.664 --> 36:16.215
Uh, yeah, in an hour.
It's the final test.

36:16.216 --> 36:18.918
And if they recognize their master

36:18.919 --> 36:21.671
in this little American boy?

36:21.672 --> 36:25.240
Then we are out of moves.

36:26.593 --> 36:29.061
You should have heard me wax poetic

36:29.062 --> 36:31.180
about the ospreys to Senator Morton.

36:31.181 --> 36:33.733
Oh, I'm sure you were
very eloquent, Conrad.

36:33.734 --> 36:36.852
No one would tell me otherwise.

36:36.853 --> 36:40.022
This job gives you an inflated
sense of your own importance,

36:40.023 --> 36:42.742
so it can be sobering when the world

36:42.743 --> 36:45.995
just does what it wants,
all your fine talk be damned.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.030
I just got word.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.415
The Dalai Lama passed away.

36:49.416 --> 36:54.253
His attendants are preparing
to take his body back to India.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.505
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.507
He was a great man.

36:58.508 --> 37:01.343
Maybe even something rarer.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.645
He was a good man.

37:04.464 --> 37:06.432
Do they still plan on testing the child?

37:06.433 --> 37:08.634
Well, Tibet needs a spiritual

37:08.635 --> 37:11.053
and symbolic leader now more than ever.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.689
I hate to root against a toddler here,

37:13.690 --> 37:16.308
but the Little Buddha'd
be doing the world a favor

37:16.309 --> 37:18.793
if he shanked this test.

37:23.066 --> 37:25.067
Hey.

37:25.068 --> 37:26.819
They're taking Ian to the chapel.

37:26.820 --> 37:28.954
News of O'Connell's
death broke this morning.

37:28.955 --> 37:31.157
Reaction's been mixed.

37:31.158 --> 37:33.125
Any pronouncements from the Elders?

37:33.126 --> 37:34.627
Soldiers of God, welcome.

37:34.628 --> 37:35.628
We'll see.

37:35.629 --> 37:38.012
Amen.

37:40.300 --> 37:41.751
It's been a hard morning.

37:41.752 --> 37:45.421
We lost Wayne, a
brother in the struggle.

37:45.422 --> 37:48.591
Suspicion abounded
and fell in particular

37:48.592 --> 37:51.427
on the newcomer.

37:51.428 --> 37:54.779
Brother Ryan, join me.

37:57.150 --> 37:59.185
Uh-oh.

37:59.186 --> 38:01.085
There's no way we can get him out now.

38:07.611 --> 38:12.915
Brother Ryan reminds me of when
Paul washed ashore in Malta.

38:12.916 --> 38:16.619
When the local people found
him, they thought, like we did,

38:16.620 --> 38:18.887
that he must be a murderer.

38:20.340 --> 38:23.342
Why would God punish
Paul with a snakebite

38:23.343 --> 38:25.944
after a shipwreck, if
he didn't have it coming?

38:28.715 --> 38:34.520
Now we hear Wayne drove
off the road to his death.

38:34.521 --> 38:36.972
But remember, my brothers,
what comes next for Paul.

38:36.973 --> 38:39.225
What comes next?

38:39.226 --> 38:40.860
It's good news.

38:40.861 --> 38:42.228
Scripture says,

38:42.229 --> 38:45.147
"But after they had looked a great while

38:45.148 --> 38:47.382
and saw no harm come to him..."

38:48.368 --> 38:51.469
"...they changed their minds
and said that he was a god."

38:52.972 --> 38:54.573
Now I'm not saying
Brother Ryan is a god.

38:54.574 --> 38:55.908
The Maltese are a fickle people.

38:57.661 --> 39:00.979
But he has endured our
judgment with patience.

39:02.382 --> 39:05.334
We apologize.

39:05.335 --> 39:08.387
Now...

39:08.388 --> 39:12.057
bless Brother Ryan as
he takes Wayne's place

39:12.058 --> 39:15.895
on the Council of Elders
and fulfills our purpose:

39:15.896 --> 39:20.182
to bring a timely end
to this decaying world!

39:20.183 --> 39:22.351
Amen. Amen!

39:27.908 --> 39:30.943
He's alive, and he's a
member of the Council now.

39:30.944 --> 39:33.245
Not a bad day at the office.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.963
Yeah, yeah.

39:36.383 --> 39:37.743
Ma'am?

39:37.744 --> 39:39.578
Geshe Tashi.

39:39.579 --> 39:40.996
I am so sorry

39:40.997 --> 39:42.491
about your teacher's passing.

39:42.492 --> 39:43.776
Thank you.

39:43.777 --> 39:46.711
His legacy lives on
in his reincarnation.

39:47.614 --> 39:50.032
The search will continue.

39:50.033 --> 39:53.419
So, Gaden Bhuti did not pass the test?

39:53.420 --> 39:56.672
When Lama Dote, Lama
Samten, and I met the child,

39:56.673 --> 40:00.775
we agreed: he is not our teacher.

40:02.462 --> 40:05.764
I know His Holiness had a lot
of faith in your discernment,

40:05.765 --> 40:08.634
so we wish Tibet luck in its search.

40:08.635 --> 40:13.222
The path to the new Lama
often has many turns.

40:13.223 --> 40:18.193
Before I go, may I fulfill
one of the Lama's last wishes?

40:18.194 --> 40:19.979
Can we go to the mandala?

40:19.980 --> 40:22.713
Of course. Yes.

40:25.118 --> 40:27.820
Shall I ask Blake to call Minister Chen?

40:27.821 --> 40:30.656
In a minute.

40:30.657 --> 40:33.724
For now, will you
please gather the staff?

40:36.663 --> 40:38.998
So, where will you search next?

40:38.999 --> 40:41.333
There is a girl in Nepal.

40:41.334 --> 40:43.335
Or perhaps there will

40:43.336 --> 40:45.603
be no Lama.

40:47.474 --> 40:52.011
I would find that kind of
ambiguity hard to accept.

40:52.012 --> 40:55.514
As you noted in the hospital,

40:55.515 --> 40:58.233
clinging to anything, including a vision

40:58.234 --> 41:00.686
or a political stance, is

41:00.687 --> 41:03.105
a recipe for suffering.

41:03.106 --> 41:06.025
The Chinese exiled the Lama,

41:06.026 --> 41:11.030
but this introduced him and
Tibetan culture to the world.

41:11.031 --> 41:13.532
Whether or not autonomy comes,

41:13.533 --> 41:16.251
Tibet lives in the hearts of many,

41:16.252 --> 41:19.254
and, so, can never die.

41:19.255 --> 41:23.375
Perhaps in this way, the
Lama did achieve his purpose.

41:23.376 --> 41:26.462
Now other purposes can flourish,

41:26.463 --> 41:29.715
perhaps not ones
beneficial only to Tibetans,

41:29.716 --> 41:31.934
but to all mankind.

41:31.935 --> 41:34.235
Thank you.
