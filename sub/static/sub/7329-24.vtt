WEBVTT

00:36.266 --> 00:39.269
Thank you, Lieutenant.

00:41.605 --> 00:44.117
You know who I am?

00:44.141 --> 00:46.006
Paloma Reynosa.

00:47.945 --> 00:50.323
Head of the Reynosa cartel.

00:50.347 --> 00:52.406
What else do you know?

00:54.718 --> 00:58.531
That the drug trade
is recession-proof.

00:58.555 --> 01:01.568
Tennessee Williams said,
"We are all sentenced

01:01.592 --> 01:05.038
to solitary confinement
inside our own skins for life."

01:05.062 --> 01:09.475
Surrounded by men with guns,
I think of this often.

01:09.499 --> 01:12.093
Beautiful, sad, but frank.

01:14.137 --> 01:16.970
Do you consider yourself
a frank man?

01:20.143 --> 01:22.222
He also said all cruel people
describe themselves

01:22.246 --> 01:23.957
as paragons of frankness.

01:23.981 --> 01:25.525
I would expect nothing less

01:25.549 --> 01:27.949
from the man
who murdered my father.

01:36.193 --> 01:39.005
I see you choose your words
carefully, Agent Gibbs.

01:39.029 --> 01:40.621
That is good.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.598
Your life depends on them.

01:46.737 --> 01:49.069
I don't usually drink scotch.

02:21.231 --> 02:22.900
This can't be happening.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.120
It cannot be happening.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.613
How could they let you in?

02:26.638 --> 02:27.949
I passed the exams.

02:27.974 --> 02:30.357
I will officially become
a citizen of the United States

02:30.381 --> 02:32.759
- of America.
- I've never been more disappointed

02:32.783 --> 02:33.860
in my government.

02:33.884 --> 02:35.929
Hey! That is my government now.

02:35.953 --> 02:37.497
Not till Friday.

02:37.521 --> 02:39.366
I expect to see you there and...

02:39.390 --> 02:40.834
you, too, McGee.

02:40.858 --> 02:42.202
Ziva, of course
I'm gonna be there.

02:42.226 --> 02:44.204
Everyone is gonna be there.

02:44.228 --> 02:45.706
Even, uh,

02:45.730 --> 02:49.076
Gibbs, I bet,
once he comes back from his...

02:49.100 --> 02:50.310
Let's call it a vacation.

02:50.334 --> 02:52.879
It is not the first time
he has run off on his own.

02:52.903 --> 02:54.781
Hey, not the first time
he's run off to Mexico.

02:54.805 --> 02:56.316
Certainly not
the first time he's gone

02:56.340 --> 02:57.484
without telling us anything.

02:57.508 --> 03:01.021
Nope, nothing new to see here.

03:01.045 --> 03:02.989
Not a poker player among you.

03:03.013 --> 03:04.491
Terrible, terrible bluffs.

03:04.515 --> 03:06.126
We're all used to how

03:06.150 --> 03:07.961
Gibbs operates,
for better, for worse.

03:07.985 --> 03:11.498
Let's just stay focused on
what we're good at without him.

03:11.522 --> 03:13.867
What would that be, Director?

03:13.891 --> 03:16.416
If you don't know, Agent
DiNozzo, I'm not gonna tell you.

03:18.028 --> 03:19.339
Agent McGee, I need you.

03:19.363 --> 03:21.842
On my way, Director.

03:21.866 --> 03:24.311
That was
a pretty tasty and cryptic

03:24.335 --> 03:26.279
bit of rejection right there.

03:26.303 --> 03:28.281
Did you see that?
The director just slammed me.

03:28.305 --> 03:29.516
I saw.

03:29.540 --> 03:32.419
Must be feeling like
the redheaded stepchild.

03:32.443 --> 03:34.421
Now, how would you get
that idiom right?

03:34.445 --> 03:35.722
Because I'm an American now.

03:35.746 --> 03:37.057
Not yet.

03:37.081 --> 03:39.174
I think I'm gonna call
my congressman.

03:40.451 --> 03:42.329
You were friendly
with Alejandro Rivera

03:42.353 --> 03:44.998
when you and Ms. Sciuto
were in Mexico, right?

03:45.022 --> 03:48.034
Well, in the broadest
definition, I suppose.

03:48.058 --> 03:50.036
We have an awkward situation
brewing already.

03:50.060 --> 03:52.005
You want to complicate
it further?

03:52.029 --> 03:53.373
I want all his information

03:53.397 --> 03:56.009
going through this office
directly, not to Ms. Hart.

03:56.033 --> 03:57.577
I've asked him to enlist

03:57.601 --> 03:59.880
the Federales in tracking down
Colonel Bell

03:59.904 --> 04:02.382
and his men south of the border.

04:02.406 --> 04:03.717
And Margaret Allison Hart, Esq.

04:03.741 --> 04:05.619
Is under the employ
of Colonel Bell.

04:05.643 --> 04:07.721
All right, I won't let you down.

04:07.745 --> 04:08.822
Bring him online, please.

04:08.846 --> 04:10.006
Yes, Director.

04:12.983 --> 04:16.428
Señor Rivera,
any update on Bell's plane?

04:16.452 --> 04:20.367
No, Director Vance, but we may
have found Colonel Bell himself.

04:20.391 --> 04:23.036
My men recovered
a partially dismembered body

04:23.060 --> 04:24.437
fitting his description.

04:24.461 --> 04:25.972
It was not far from the massacre

04:25.996 --> 04:28.008
at the home
of an American expatriate

04:28.032 --> 04:29.976
by the name of Mike Franks.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.479
Technicians are still
processing that scene,

04:32.503 --> 04:34.781
employing lessons learned
from Ms. Sciuto.

04:34.805 --> 04:36.183
Well, they learned well.

04:36.207 --> 04:37.617
We received
the fingerprint scans.

04:37.641 --> 04:39.686
Already identified
several of the deceased

04:39.710 --> 04:43.423
from military databases as known
associates of Colonel Bell.

04:43.447 --> 04:46.393
The others are suspected members
of the Reynosa cartel.

04:46.417 --> 04:49.329
A laundry list of charges
against each of them.

04:49.353 --> 04:51.531
I'm tasking my agents
from the San Diego office

04:51.555 --> 04:53.099
to assist you on the ground.

04:53.123 --> 04:55.535
If you have no objections,
our Navy transport

04:55.559 --> 04:57.604
will retrieve the evidence
and the bodies.

04:57.628 --> 04:59.072
I believe the presence

04:59.096 --> 05:01.608
of American agents
may help calm the violence,

05:01.632 --> 05:04.477
because this cartel
is afraid of nothing in Mexico.

05:04.501 --> 05:05.946
If I'm unavailable,

05:05.970 --> 05:08.281
you'll communicate directly
with Special Agent McGee.

05:08.305 --> 05:09.282
Understood.

05:09.306 --> 05:10.306
All yours.

05:12.009 --> 05:14.621
Questions for me, Agent McGee?

05:14.645 --> 05:18.024
Sir, any sign of Gibbs
or Franks on that beach?

05:18.048 --> 05:19.526
No.

05:19.550 --> 05:20.861
Of Gibbs?

05:20.885 --> 05:22.512
He's in Mexico?

05:25.022 --> 05:27.334
You solve crimes for a living.

05:27.358 --> 05:30.670
Is there such a thing
as a perfect murder?

05:30.694 --> 05:32.439
I've never seen one.

05:32.463 --> 05:34.829
But how would it work?

05:37.635 --> 05:39.779
It's not the method,
it's the victim.

05:39.803 --> 05:41.448
Kill someone no one will miss.

05:41.472 --> 05:44.484
You don't need tips
on how to kill me.

05:44.508 --> 05:46.987
I am not opposed

05:47.011 --> 05:49.489
to killing or torture,
when it suits my needs.

05:49.513 --> 05:51.458
That is part of my business.

05:51.482 --> 05:54.394
The late Colonel Bell

05:54.418 --> 05:57.597
wanted to prove
he was a better man than you.

05:57.621 --> 06:00.901
He and his men made
for a useful ally, but...

06:00.925 --> 06:03.236
they were a means to an end.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.405
Namely you.

06:05.429 --> 06:09.042
I don't know what you're after,
but you might as well

06:09.066 --> 06:11.111
put a bullet
in my head right now,

06:11.135 --> 06:13.513
because you're not
gonna get anything.

06:13.537 --> 06:16.483
It's never easy to turn someone,
to change them.

06:16.507 --> 06:20.754
A federal agent
in Washington, D.C.

06:20.778 --> 06:22.769
You have value.

06:24.548 --> 06:26.359
I don't want your death.

06:26.383 --> 06:28.977
I want your life.

06:46.269 --> 06:49.615
You gonna make me suffer?

06:49.639 --> 06:53.919
Threat of a murder charge
force me to work with you?

06:53.943 --> 06:58.390
Thing about being a cop
called burden of proof.

06:58.414 --> 06:59.925
You want evidence.

06:59.949 --> 07:03.762
An investigation
performed by your own people

07:03.786 --> 07:06.198
that conclusively puts
your signature on the crime.

07:06.222 --> 07:07.633
Show me.

07:07.657 --> 07:10.202
Prove to me
I'm guilty of a crime.

07:10.226 --> 07:12.304
Bring it out in the open.

07:12.328 --> 07:15.240
I know something
about convictions.

07:15.264 --> 07:17.528
I get 'em and I got 'em.

07:21.938 --> 07:24.950
I don't care to put you
on trial, Gibbs.

07:24.974 --> 07:28.034
It may not suit my needs
to kill you,

07:29.012 --> 07:30.990
but it might be useful

07:31.014 --> 07:33.312
to kill everyone you ever met.

07:39.822 --> 07:43.155
Starting with your friend Mike.

07:45.762 --> 07:49.308
Your former mother-in-law
comes next.

07:49.332 --> 07:51.323
Doing me favors now?

07:52.435 --> 07:54.513
And then your coworkers.

07:54.537 --> 07:56.682
If I must,

07:56.706 --> 08:00.552
I promise to personally
visit Pennsylvania

08:00.576 --> 08:03.340
and shoot your father
in the head.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.779
That would complete the circle.

08:09.485 --> 08:11.851
We will start small.

08:13.556 --> 08:15.956
Just make sure this package
is delivered.

08:18.561 --> 08:21.894
How many more lives
are your convictions worth?

08:25.468 --> 08:27.312
Thank you, Captain.
They're on their way.

08:27.336 --> 08:28.714
G-5 out of Dulles?

08:28.738 --> 08:30.816
C-130 fueling at Pax River.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.317
I want you two on board.

08:32.341 --> 08:33.318
Where is it going?

08:33.342 --> 08:34.787
Ride-along to Mexico.

08:34.811 --> 08:37.823
Ms. Sciuto and Dr. Mallard
are done with the cold case.

08:37.847 --> 08:39.691
Return Hernandez's body,

08:39.715 --> 08:42.494
escort the new bodies back
to Andrews and then here.

08:42.518 --> 08:44.496
Assure an unbroken
chain of evidence.

08:44.520 --> 08:46.398
McGee, tell Rivera

08:46.422 --> 08:47.933
the airlift is en route.

08:47.957 --> 08:49.134
Uh, he's got news, too...

08:49.158 --> 08:51.670
no word on Franks,
but apparently,

08:51.694 --> 08:53.958
he thinks they have
tracked Gibbs' location.

08:55.198 --> 08:57.142
I never mentioned Gibbs to them.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.678
Who told them to look for Gibbs?

08:59.702 --> 09:01.580
Well, I may have mentioned it.

09:01.604 --> 09:03.799
Was that not supposed to happen?

09:08.111 --> 09:10.622
You want us to bring
Gibbs back, too, Director?

09:10.646 --> 09:13.459
Plane's only gonna be on the
ground long enough to load...

09:13.483 --> 09:14.960
couple of hours, tops.

09:14.984 --> 09:17.296
You really think you can
locate and retrieve Gibbs

09:17.320 --> 09:19.652
in that period of time?

09:21.190 --> 09:23.335
Did you see that?

09:23.359 --> 09:25.671
See what?

09:25.695 --> 09:27.473
The wink.

09:27.497 --> 09:28.640
Director Vance winked?

09:28.664 --> 09:30.008
I think he winked.

09:30.032 --> 09:31.977
Unless he was prepping
his eye for the scanner, but...

09:32.001 --> 09:33.378
Why would it matter
if he winked?

09:33.402 --> 09:35.114
'Cause that's what
he and Gibbs do.

09:35.138 --> 09:38.550
They have this whole
wink-wink-nudge-nudge language.

09:38.574 --> 09:41.720
If Vance can't
green-light an op,

09:41.744 --> 09:46.191
he expects us to pick up
the slack when we see it.

09:46.215 --> 09:47.359
You see slack?

09:47.383 --> 09:48.360
I don't know.

09:48.384 --> 09:50.147
Did you see a wink?

10:02.131 --> 10:04.767
Very well.

10:12.475 --> 10:15.254
Buenos dias, Señor Rivera.

10:15.278 --> 10:17.256
Es policia.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.124
¡Es Americano!

10:19.148 --> 10:21.326
¿Hay un problema?

10:21.350 --> 10:23.495
We are just having a drink.

10:23.519 --> 10:25.397
Agent Gibbs,

10:25.421 --> 10:28.167
has this woman made threats
against you?

10:28.191 --> 10:30.625
Do you want to file charges
for abduction?

10:32.929 --> 10:35.073
Remember my advice.

10:35.097 --> 10:37.395
Choose your words carefully.

10:38.434 --> 10:41.079
No threat...

10:41.103 --> 10:42.764
against me personally.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.851
You are reaching.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.543
So are you.

10:52.982 --> 10:54.016
Sí, Señor Rivera.

10:57.453 --> 10:59.965
Come with me.

10:59.989 --> 11:02.423
Say adios.

11:13.236 --> 11:15.280
How'd you find me?

11:15.304 --> 11:17.649
I follow her moves very closely.

11:17.673 --> 11:19.718
She is never reckless.

11:19.742 --> 11:22.721
Difficult, almost impossible
to prosecute.

11:22.745 --> 11:25.324
I nearly had her
when a private investigator

11:25.348 --> 11:27.826
from America came digging
into her father's death.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.728
She had the PI killed.

11:29.752 --> 11:32.831
You had your task force
investigate the cold case.

11:32.855 --> 11:34.967
Pedro Hernandez.

11:34.991 --> 11:37.803
Or was that just coincidence?

11:37.827 --> 11:39.538
The report Ms. Sciuto prepared?

11:39.562 --> 11:40.973
I still have not seen it.

11:40.997 --> 11:44.042
Paloma must have someone
on the inside.

11:44.066 --> 11:46.078
Nah, she hadn't
seen it yet, either.

11:46.102 --> 11:47.145
What happened to it?

11:47.169 --> 11:48.347
Someone must have stopped it.

11:48.371 --> 11:49.781
Ms. Sciuto?

11:49.805 --> 11:51.083
No.

11:51.107 --> 11:52.517
You are certain?

11:52.541 --> 11:54.987
Yeah.

11:55.011 --> 11:56.822
I'm dead certain.

11:56.846 --> 11:58.557
I wouldn't allow it.

11:58.581 --> 12:00.759
I believe this.

12:00.783 --> 12:03.595
That's all I needed to know.

12:03.619 --> 12:06.598
Someone took a bullet
for you, Gibbs,

12:06.622 --> 12:09.056
but you will take the next one.

12:12.662 --> 12:14.687
Surprise.

12:19.802 --> 12:21.013
Well, hermano,

12:21.037 --> 12:22.914
does he have
your precious report?

12:22.938 --> 12:24.850
No.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.865
Hermano.

12:28.411 --> 12:30.572
Brother and sister.

12:32.048 --> 12:34.744
I guess she never
had to turn you.

12:36.819 --> 12:39.564
You should hear the words
to the oath I have to take.

12:39.588 --> 12:41.933
I basically have to renounce
all my ties to Israel.

12:41.957 --> 12:43.602
Well, you will still
be you, Ziva,

12:43.626 --> 12:45.992
and I'll be there
to hear it, I promise.

12:47.563 --> 12:48.807
You guys are going to Mexico.

12:48.831 --> 12:49.808
What's the plan?

12:49.832 --> 12:50.966
What do you know, Abbs?

12:53.803 --> 12:56.114
Gibbs mentioned rule 40.

12:56.138 --> 12:58.583
If you think someone's
out to get you, they are?

12:58.607 --> 13:00.752
I have never heard
a rule in the 40s.

13:00.776 --> 13:02.454
They don't come up very often.

13:02.478 --> 13:03.955
And that's a good thing.

13:03.979 --> 13:06.591
How many times have I told Gibbs
to write these things down?

13:06.615 --> 13:08.593
You don't have to write 'em
down, they're for daily use...

13:08.617 --> 13:10.595
most of the rules...
but the 40s...

13:10.619 --> 13:13.098
The 40s. The 40s are
for emergency use only.

13:13.122 --> 13:14.499
If the 40s are in play,

13:14.523 --> 13:16.601
something unspeakably bad
is going down.

13:16.625 --> 13:19.253
We have to get him back.

13:26.669 --> 13:28.447
Your sister wants
to make me her pet.

13:28.471 --> 13:29.581
And you?

13:29.605 --> 13:30.582
What do you want?

13:30.606 --> 13:33.251
You want to put me on trial?

13:33.275 --> 13:34.653
I cannot.

13:34.677 --> 13:39.157
Without that report,
it will be her way.

13:39.181 --> 13:41.827
Or she kills everyone you love.

13:41.851 --> 13:43.995
There is no other option.

13:44.019 --> 13:46.783
I've had this before.

13:50.826 --> 13:53.472
There's no way out.

13:53.496 --> 13:56.041
And that riddle.

13:56.065 --> 13:58.510
Guy trapped in a room...

13:58.534 --> 14:01.780
no doors, no windows.

14:01.804 --> 14:03.482
Then how did he get there?

14:03.506 --> 14:05.517
Was built around him,
but there's nothing there

14:05.541 --> 14:07.052
except a mirror and a table.

14:07.076 --> 14:08.941
How does he get out?

14:10.646 --> 14:12.424
Here's a hint.

14:12.448 --> 14:14.884
It won't work in Spanish.

14:16.318 --> 14:19.531
Look in the mirror,

14:19.555 --> 14:22.534
see what you saw, take the saw,

14:22.558 --> 14:24.703
cut the table in half,

14:24.727 --> 14:27.439
two halves make a whole,

14:27.463 --> 14:29.608
climb out the hole.

14:29.632 --> 14:31.977
Most retarded riddle
I've ever heard.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.764
My father told it to me.

14:35.805 --> 14:37.940
My dad.

14:39.208 --> 14:41.286
Never an easy guy.

14:41.310 --> 14:44.177
But it takes a man
to make a man, right?

14:46.682 --> 14:48.843
Hermano.

14:50.786 --> 14:53.165
When things get rough,

14:53.189 --> 14:54.588
I can still go talk to him.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.739
You know so much, Gibbs.

15:00.763 --> 15:02.574
Well, tell me this.

15:02.598 --> 15:04.943
How will this feel to me?

15:04.967 --> 15:08.232
What will it feel like
to pull this trigger?

15:09.205 --> 15:11.616
Alejandro...

15:11.640 --> 15:13.552
don't let him make you
into a killer.

15:13.576 --> 15:15.220
You are more powerful
in the government.

15:15.244 --> 15:16.721
Bastante, Paloma!

15:16.745 --> 15:20.091
I'm gonna shoot him
with his own gun.

15:20.115 --> 15:22.276
You've never done this before.

15:24.320 --> 15:25.630
I have.

15:25.654 --> 15:29.100
I've killed men and women

15:29.124 --> 15:33.038
in combat, in the line,
and in life,

15:33.062 --> 15:35.257
and some of them still haunt me.

15:37.032 --> 15:41.025
But I never lost a night's sleep
over your father.

15:42.905 --> 15:46.568
You want to know what it feels
like to be the hand of justice?

15:48.143 --> 15:51.112
Then pull the damn trigger
yourself and find out. Go on.

15:52.248 --> 15:53.943
Do it!

16:01.991 --> 16:04.369
All right, we gotta move fast.

16:04.393 --> 16:05.570
And quietly.

16:05.594 --> 16:08.507
No authority,
no jurisdiction, no time.

16:08.531 --> 16:11.109
We do not get back on
this plane without Gibbs.

16:11.133 --> 16:13.101
Agreed.

16:38.927 --> 16:40.451
You didn't find Franks?

16:42.831 --> 16:45.143
I said, you didn't find
Mike Franks?

16:45.167 --> 16:46.978
I heard you.

16:47.002 --> 16:48.867
So you just don't
want to talk about it?

16:50.906 --> 16:55.153
Bartender said that Franks'
family left town the day before.

16:55.177 --> 16:56.588
So he knew something was coming.

16:56.612 --> 16:58.603
What else did you find out?

17:00.816 --> 17:03.361
Federales got tired
of me asking questions.

17:03.385 --> 17:06.263
Why didn't you just tell them
you were with the task force?

17:06.288 --> 17:07.499
Because I wasn't!

17:07.522 --> 17:09.467
Still, I would've thought

17:09.491 --> 17:11.202
it'd take the whole Mexican Army
to kick you out.

17:11.226 --> 17:12.503
Hey, back there,

17:12.528 --> 17:15.006
we got some turbulence
coming up.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.930
Still a couple hours
from Andrews... hang on.

17:26.108 --> 17:29.254
You get held up at customs,
use my name.

17:29.278 --> 17:30.889
Where are you gonna be?

17:30.913 --> 17:33.006
Left a mess I got to clean up.

17:36.151 --> 17:38.129
That's 45.

17:38.153 --> 17:40.144
Basically.

17:44.726 --> 17:46.704
This one.
That's the right model.

17:46.728 --> 17:48.940
You picked up
an extra passenger.

17:48.964 --> 17:50.341
Yeah. Funny that.

17:50.365 --> 17:52.510
Gibbs was just waiting for us
at the airport.

17:52.534 --> 17:55.013
Well, Alejandro called us
while you were in the air.

17:55.037 --> 17:56.314
Your new best buddy?

17:56.338 --> 17:59.417
He said he had
to run Gibbs out of town.

17:59.441 --> 18:00.852
Tempers running high already.

18:00.876 --> 18:02.821
Last thing he needed
was another cowboy.

18:02.845 --> 18:04.789
Maybe he should've asked,
uh, your permission

18:04.813 --> 18:06.090
before he went down there.

18:06.114 --> 18:07.826
He doesn't need my permission.

18:07.850 --> 18:09.784
But without it, he doesn't
get your protection.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.798
Fit it for a GPS and a bug.

18:13.822 --> 18:14.933
Yeah.

18:14.957 --> 18:16.267
Where's Gibbs?

18:16.291 --> 18:18.603
Uh, he went home for
a shower and change of clothes.

18:18.627 --> 18:20.271
Got some enchilada
and dust on his shirt.

18:20.295 --> 18:22.627
When he gets in,
tell him I'd like to see him.

18:32.007 --> 18:33.651
Mr. Palmer,

18:33.675 --> 18:36.020
do you mind doing that
a little more quietly?

18:36.044 --> 18:37.889
I can hardly hear myself think.

18:37.913 --> 18:40.258
Sorry, Doctor.

18:40.282 --> 18:41.759
What are you thinking about?

18:41.783 --> 18:43.795
My God.

18:43.819 --> 18:45.129
What is it?

18:45.153 --> 18:46.631
My mind's a complete blank.

18:46.655 --> 18:49.367
Has that ever happened before?

18:49.391 --> 18:50.802
Well...

18:50.826 --> 18:54.005
Ah, perhaps
this reminds you of a time

18:54.029 --> 18:55.673
when y...

18:55.697 --> 18:58.343
Or-Or maybe you were
just a lad, and...

18:58.367 --> 19:00.712
What is it you're doing,
Mr. Palmer?

19:00.736 --> 19:03.715
I thought maybe if I teed
the ball up properly...

19:03.739 --> 19:04.973
I might find the fairway.

19:06.341 --> 19:08.820
Yes, that does remind me
of a caddy

19:08.844 --> 19:11.055
on a golf course
just north of Glasgow.

19:11.079 --> 19:13.958
He kept giving me
unasked-for tips.

19:13.982 --> 19:16.828
Every time I'd hit the ball,
he'd say, "No, no, no."

19:16.852 --> 19:18.396
He drove me crazy.

19:18.420 --> 19:23.034
Finally, on the 18th,
I am sitting 218 from the pin.

19:23.058 --> 19:24.869
He hands me a five iron.

19:24.893 --> 19:28.039
"Lay up," he says,
"and you'll be on in two."

19:28.063 --> 19:30.675
I stared at the man,
and then, for a moment,

19:30.699 --> 19:33.778
my mind went completely blank.

19:33.802 --> 19:35.313
Then I held out my hand.

19:35.337 --> 19:37.882
"Three wood," I said calmly.

19:37.906 --> 19:39.250
"I'm going for it."

19:39.274 --> 19:40.485
"You?" he says.

19:40.509 --> 19:42.320
"Impossible."

19:42.344 --> 19:44.422
So, I take my stance...

19:44.446 --> 19:48.059
yeah... a day's
frustration behind me.

19:48.083 --> 19:51.653
And I uncork
the shot of a lifetime.

19:52.854 --> 19:55.867
As the ball flew away,
I screamed out

19:55.891 --> 19:58.703
a dreadful obscenity at the man.

19:58.727 --> 20:00.872
Yeah, but you made the green.

20:00.896 --> 20:02.440
No, no,
I overshot it by 15 yards.

20:02.464 --> 20:03.441
Took a triple bogey.

20:03.465 --> 20:06.344
But, Mr. Palmer,
I learned a lesson.

20:06.368 --> 20:09.447
Being correct does not excuse

20:09.471 --> 20:11.683
a violation of form.

20:11.707 --> 20:15.053
Now... take those slugs
from Bell's body

20:15.077 --> 20:18.256
up to Abby, and then finish
opening your crates,

20:18.280 --> 20:20.271
as quietly as possible.

20:26.621 --> 20:27.932
Hey, Dad.

20:27.956 --> 20:29.300
How you feeling?

20:29.324 --> 20:31.903
No. I'm good. I'm good. Um...

20:31.927 --> 20:33.938
Listen, is there anybody
you could stay with

20:33.962 --> 20:35.020
for a few days?

20:37.666 --> 20:39.177
What's the status
on the evidence?

20:39.201 --> 20:40.745
I'm running the slug
through the system now

20:40.769 --> 20:43.138
that came from Bell's body,
but I don't expect to get a...

20:44.973 --> 20:46.751
Match. Weird. Okay.

20:46.775 --> 20:48.855
That means the murder weapon's
already in the system.

20:50.178 --> 20:51.823
Oh, no. Not again.

20:51.847 --> 20:54.726
What again?

20:54.750 --> 20:56.227
Do you think there's any chance

20:56.251 --> 20:58.663
that Gibbs went down to Mexico
to kill Bell?

20:58.687 --> 21:00.898
Why would you think
something like that?

21:00.922 --> 21:03.692
Because...

21:05.694 --> 21:08.822
the slugs came from Gibbs' SIG.

21:10.932 --> 21:13.277
What would you say
if we told you

21:13.301 --> 21:15.880
that the slugs removed
from Bell's torso

21:15.904 --> 21:17.582
came from Gibbs' gun?

21:17.606 --> 21:20.184
I would say that someone is
trying to present Gibbs

21:20.208 --> 21:22.020
as a... well, as a murderer.

21:22.044 --> 21:24.322
When he clearly is not?

21:24.346 --> 21:27.025
Well, as friend and a colleague,
I think the best of Jethro,

21:27.049 --> 21:30.862
so, yes, I would like to believe
that he did not kill this man.

21:30.886 --> 21:34.799
But as a scientist,
I know that he did not.

21:34.823 --> 21:36.801
How can you be certain?

21:36.825 --> 21:38.836
Well, the fatal injury
was to the head,

21:38.860 --> 21:40.438
and I would speculate
that there are

21:40.462 --> 21:43.307
defensive wounds to the hands.

21:43.331 --> 21:47.879
This dismemberment was intended
to cloud not only the identity

21:47.903 --> 21:50.048
of the victim,
but also of his killer.

21:50.072 --> 21:51.716
Additionally,

21:51.740 --> 21:55.319
Gibbs has always told us
not to believe in coincidence,

21:55.343 --> 21:58.423
so when I see
this serrated pattern,

21:58.447 --> 22:02.293
so similar to the KA-BAR nick
on Agent Macy's neck...

22:02.317 --> 22:04.195
It's the same knife.

22:04.219 --> 22:05.196
Same killer.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.531
Most likely.

22:06.555 --> 22:08.733
Bell's lieutenant turned on him.

22:08.757 --> 22:11.102
And we know where Dean is.

22:11.126 --> 22:13.171
He's with the cartel.

22:13.195 --> 22:14.539
How did he get Gibbs' gun?

22:14.563 --> 22:17.327
Gibbs has always said
there's only one way to do that.

22:18.834 --> 22:21.894
Pry it from his dead, cold hand.

22:23.572 --> 22:25.349
Since Gibbs is not dead,

22:25.373 --> 22:28.653
then we have to assume
he met Dean... in Mexico.

22:28.677 --> 22:30.888
I am busy here, tracking Dean.

22:30.912 --> 22:33.958
Tony, why would Gibbs ever
let him walk away alive?

22:33.982 --> 22:36.027
I mean, I'm tracing
cell phones, e-mails,

22:36.051 --> 22:38.029
credit card transactions...
this is McGeek work.

22:38.053 --> 22:39.230
He's still in MTAC.

22:39.254 --> 22:41.365
Yeah. Gleefully chasing scraps

22:41.389 --> 22:43.468
of opportunity that Director
Vance drops in front of him.

22:43.492 --> 22:45.369
He's like one of those fish
that swims around

22:45.393 --> 22:46.537
inside of a shark's mouth,

22:46.561 --> 22:48.539
- picking stuff out of their teeth.
- Pilot.

22:48.563 --> 22:49.540
Yeah, pilot fish.

22:49.564 --> 22:50.708
No! The pilot.

22:50.732 --> 22:51.943
Bell's corporate jet.

22:51.967 --> 22:53.511
This charge
at the Hacienda Grotto...

22:53.535 --> 22:54.946
he has checked out.

22:54.970 --> 22:56.981
Plane's gonna be moving soon.

22:57.005 --> 22:59.517
And here,
Bell's personal cell phone.

22:59.541 --> 23:01.853
Look at the time stamps
on these calls.

23:01.877 --> 23:03.521
Dead men don't make phone calls.

23:03.545 --> 23:05.223
Someone else
is using his phone...

23:05.247 --> 23:07.558
perhaps the, uh,
elusive J.P. Dean.

23:07.582 --> 23:11.129
I will do that McGee thing
to make sure it is active.

23:11.153 --> 23:13.264
Look at us...
doing it without him.

23:13.288 --> 23:14.732
- Without who?
- Hey, boss.

23:14.756 --> 23:17.101
I mean, not you, boss...
I mean, not that

23:17.125 --> 23:19.303
we would ever do anything
without you, because...

23:19.327 --> 23:21.639
well, within you or without
you... it's like a U2 song.

23:21.663 --> 23:23.641
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

23:23.665 --> 23:25.496
Director Vance would like
to see you.

23:30.205 --> 23:32.950
I did it! The phone is active.

23:32.974 --> 23:35.119
Dean is making a call right now.

23:35.143 --> 23:38.480
Oh. Can you find out
who he's calling?

23:39.481 --> 23:41.142
I think so. Just a...

23:46.154 --> 23:48.622
He's calling Gibbs.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.840
You need to get that?

24:06.188 --> 24:08.290
It's a voice mail.

24:08.315 --> 24:09.783
What are the chances
it's a message

24:09.808 --> 24:11.843
from Lieutenant J.P. Dean...

24:12.113 --> 24:13.481
the man who murdered Agent Macy

24:13.506 --> 24:15.066
and possibly his own boss,
Colonel Bell?

24:15.282 --> 24:16.259
I don't know.

24:16.283 --> 24:17.341
I'd have to check.

24:29.763 --> 24:32.409
I spent a lot of time
in Los Angeles this year,

24:32.433 --> 24:34.211
getting that office
up and running.

24:34.235 --> 24:35.478
I noticed.

24:35.502 --> 24:37.013
Hetty Lange out there,

24:37.037 --> 24:39.449
she's got a friend
at Warner Bros.

24:39.473 --> 24:42.285
Took us on an inside
studio tour.

24:42.309 --> 24:46.223
Lot of old props, costumes,
all the way back to Casablanca.

24:46.247 --> 24:49.092
You should tell DiNozzo.

24:49.116 --> 24:52.829
When I started here,
with our different philosophies,

24:52.853 --> 24:54.898
took me a minute to figure out

24:54.922 --> 24:56.399
how we were going
to get along, Gibbs.

24:56.423 --> 24:58.902
I thought about Rick
and Louis from Casablanca.

24:58.926 --> 25:01.404
What, and I'm Rick?

25:01.428 --> 25:03.607
Oh, in so many ways.

25:03.631 --> 25:05.242
The problem's me.

25:05.266 --> 25:07.010
I'm sick of being Louis.

25:07.034 --> 25:09.212
I'm sick of having
to look the other way

25:09.236 --> 25:10.981
when I know you're sneaking
around behind my back.

25:11.005 --> 25:12.148
That doesn't work for me.

25:12.172 --> 25:14.217
Well, maybe I shouldn't
work for you.

25:14.241 --> 25:17.721
You tell me what the hell
you're into right now.

25:17.745 --> 25:18.922
That's an order.

25:18.946 --> 25:21.278
No.

25:24.118 --> 25:25.495
You're benched.

25:25.519 --> 25:26.763
Took you long enough, Leon.

25:26.787 --> 25:29.065
You want to try me? Come on.

25:29.089 --> 25:30.734
What stopped you day one?

25:30.758 --> 25:33.503
My job, my life,
does not revolve around you,

25:33.527 --> 25:35.238
you egocentric son of a bitch.

25:35.262 --> 25:36.773
You sure make it sound
like it does.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.074
One word and you're done.

25:38.098 --> 25:40.910
And you hate me
because I can make that call.

25:40.934 --> 25:44.538
Right, because my life
revolves around you.

25:46.340 --> 25:47.602
What?

25:48.642 --> 25:50.086
Director, uh,

25:50.110 --> 25:53.556
Bell's jet just cleared
Mexican airspace.

25:53.580 --> 25:55.191
Alejandro couldn't stop it.

25:55.215 --> 25:56.960
Filed a flight plan
for Virginia.

25:56.984 --> 25:58.695
- How long?
- Five hours.

25:58.719 --> 26:01.598
And since the entire case
seems to be headed here,

26:01.622 --> 26:03.783
Alejandro's gonna follow
on the next available flight.

26:05.559 --> 26:06.583
I'll be taking that.

26:19.073 --> 26:21.751
Gibbs, have you met Darren?

26:21.775 --> 26:23.787
Darren's an armed
security guard.

26:23.811 --> 26:26.056
He's recently been
reassigned to guard me.

26:26.080 --> 26:28.071
Although I have no idea
why that might be.

26:33.020 --> 26:37.000
Except when I look at you,
I know exactly why.

26:37.024 --> 26:38.735
- Abby, I'm sorry...
- Gibbs,

26:38.759 --> 26:40.470
why would you say that to me?

26:40.494 --> 26:44.074
It terrifies me when you break
your own rules.

26:44.098 --> 26:45.475
You see what I'm doing there?

26:45.499 --> 26:49.112
Wagging my finger
to stop you from talking.

26:49.136 --> 26:50.246
It's something that
Mike Franks is

26:50.270 --> 26:51.881
probably never going
to be able to do again.

26:51.905 --> 26:54.150
It is his finger, right?

26:54.174 --> 26:57.620
Right index, to be specific.

26:57.644 --> 27:01.057
Also known as the forefinger,
the digitus secundus,

27:01.081 --> 27:03.827
pointer finger
and the trigger finger.

27:03.851 --> 27:05.862
It's something else Mike Franks

27:05.886 --> 27:08.131
will probably never
be able to do again.

27:08.155 --> 27:09.866
He was alive when
it was severed, though?

27:09.890 --> 27:11.101
Ducky thinks so.

27:11.125 --> 27:12.502
And it was shot off.

27:12.526 --> 27:14.771
For whatever it's worth.

27:14.795 --> 27:17.974
Gibbs, do they have him?

27:17.998 --> 27:19.260
D-Do they have Mike?

27:21.468 --> 27:25.839
Can you, can you at least
tell me who they are?

27:33.313 --> 27:36.680
I guess that's why superheroes
have secret identities.

27:43.724 --> 27:47.137
Despite his reputation
in this building,

27:47.161 --> 27:50.840
I considered Bell a good man.

27:50.864 --> 27:53.676
I imagine you wouldn't have
worked for him

27:53.700 --> 27:55.278
if you'd believed otherwise.

27:55.302 --> 27:59.482
Thank you, Doctor,
for that consideration.

27:59.506 --> 28:01.017
Forgive me.

28:01.041 --> 28:04.678
I forget sometimes the effect
this room has on people.

28:05.979 --> 28:09.471
It does lend itself
to a measure of introspection.

28:11.718 --> 28:15.999
What is it you want to know,
Dr. Mallard?

28:16.023 --> 28:18.401
It was the colonel
who had an axe to grind

28:18.425 --> 28:19.803
with Gibbs, not you.

28:19.827 --> 28:21.971
You were carrying out orders.

28:21.995 --> 28:24.507
It was a request.

28:24.531 --> 28:26.743
One I was free to decline.

28:26.767 --> 28:30.246
But you were interested
in learning more about Gibbs.

28:30.270 --> 28:33.316
Yes... I was.

28:33.340 --> 28:36.252
And now you're feeling
you backed the wrong man.

28:36.276 --> 28:38.744
Now...

28:40.581 --> 28:44.881
I'm remembering you have some
sort of psychological degree.

28:46.753 --> 28:50.900
It's a small airfield,
not far from Bell's residence.

28:50.924 --> 28:52.268
Keeps a hanger here.

28:52.292 --> 28:54.270
Alejandro's sure
Dean is on board?

28:54.294 --> 28:55.538
Eyewitness confirms
Dean was traveling

28:55.562 --> 28:57.040
with at least four other men.

28:57.064 --> 28:58.732
Including the pilot and copilot.

28:59.933 --> 29:01.511
You three meet the plane.

29:01.535 --> 29:04.380
Grab Dean as soon as
he steps off.

29:04.404 --> 29:05.515
Bring him back.

29:05.539 --> 29:07.350
Any questions?

29:07.374 --> 29:08.451
One.

29:08.475 --> 29:10.053
Who's gonna lead?

29:10.077 --> 29:12.739
Agent DiNozzo's got point.

29:23.156 --> 29:25.101
All right, this is our bird.

29:25.125 --> 29:26.236
McGee?

29:26.260 --> 29:27.437
In position.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.672
Ziva?

29:29.696 --> 29:31.163
Set.

29:50.284 --> 29:53.096
You got a visual on our guy?

29:53.120 --> 29:54.951
Target acquired.

29:56.089 --> 29:57.317
Let's go.

30:03.330 --> 30:04.807
Ziva, switch out
of night vision;

30:04.831 --> 30:05.808
This is gonna get bright.

30:05.832 --> 30:07.060
Copy.

30:08.368 --> 30:11.347
NCIS. Put down your weapons.

30:11.371 --> 30:14.017
J.P. Dean, you are under arrest.

30:14.041 --> 30:16.339
Double-crossing son of a!

31:06.192 --> 31:09.138
What do you think, Director?

31:09.162 --> 31:13.308
Dean here killed Macy,
killed Bell,

31:13.332 --> 31:15.210
played some part in the shootout

31:15.234 --> 31:17.279
between the cartel members
and Bell's men.

31:17.303 --> 31:18.847
Maybe killed Mike Franks.

31:18.871 --> 31:23.308
Dead or alive, are his
whereabouts still undetermined?

31:25.144 --> 31:28.524
I did retrieve .45-caliber slugs

31:28.548 --> 31:30.225
from that shootout in Mexico.

31:30.249 --> 31:31.960
It's Mike Franks'
weapon of choice.

31:31.984 --> 31:35.511
Yeah, I'm gonna go
double stack the drawers.

31:42.962 --> 31:45.474
I fly out to resolve
the situation,

31:45.498 --> 31:47.242
only to find it
already resolved.

31:47.266 --> 31:49.645
You tell Dean
he was in the clear?

31:49.669 --> 31:51.580
You tell him
that your guy in D.C.

31:51.604 --> 31:53.081
is going to take care of him?

31:53.105 --> 31:55.551
Turns out to be true.

31:55.575 --> 31:57.619
If you have bad intentions,

31:57.643 --> 32:00.556
Washington airspace
certainly becomes treacherous.

32:00.580 --> 32:02.558
All those bodies.

32:02.582 --> 32:04.726
Dean takes the fall.

32:04.750 --> 32:07.062
Smart.

32:07.086 --> 32:08.597
You thought me otherwise?

32:08.621 --> 32:11.767
Never underestimate
your opponent.

32:11.791 --> 32:13.101
Should write that down.

32:13.125 --> 32:17.272
Except you and I
are on the same side.

32:17.296 --> 32:19.374
You hold the cards.

32:19.398 --> 32:23.145
You and Paloma have Frank, so...

32:23.169 --> 32:25.113
you have your delivery.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.434
You didn't open it?

32:27.540 --> 32:29.235
I didn't need to.

32:32.879 --> 32:34.456
"We have to distrust each other

32:34.480 --> 32:37.617
as our only defense
against betrayal."

32:38.784 --> 32:41.363
My sister and her quotes.

32:41.387 --> 32:44.533
You guys have a way
of making a man feel left out.

32:44.557 --> 32:46.401
Director Vance.

32:46.425 --> 32:49.972
Just trying to soothe
some fractured egos.

32:49.996 --> 32:52.441
With Agent Gibbs,
that could be dangerous.

32:52.465 --> 32:53.809
Always a politician, huh?

32:53.833 --> 32:55.357
You, of all people,
would understand.

32:56.402 --> 32:58.780
That something from home?

32:58.804 --> 33:02.399
Yes, to sweeten
any sour feelings.

33:07.446 --> 33:08.824
What is this?

33:08.848 --> 33:09.892
Candy.

33:09.916 --> 33:11.144
Handmade.

33:13.419 --> 33:15.264
Well...

33:15.288 --> 33:16.380
I'll be on my way.

33:20.626 --> 33:22.871
Unless you have
that report for me.

33:22.895 --> 33:24.806
You should already have it.

33:24.830 --> 33:26.991
Ms. Sciuto sent it
straight to the task force.

33:40.947 --> 33:43.091
If you have bad intentions,

33:43.115 --> 33:45.583
Washington airspace certainly
becomes treacherous.

33:48.854 --> 33:50.766
He's cagey... Alejandro.

33:50.790 --> 33:52.301
Doesn't give anything away.

33:52.325 --> 33:53.435
Well, neither did you.

33:53.459 --> 33:55.154
New battery.

33:58.698 --> 34:00.689
Here you go.

34:02.301 --> 34:05.634
You made it obvious that your
hands were tied without saying.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.052
Well...

34:10.076 --> 34:12.054
couldn't.

34:12.078 --> 34:14.922
I knew this delivery
was just a test.

34:14.947 --> 34:16.491
I figured I could buy time.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.360
Put a lot of trust that
I'd follow your lead, Gibbs.

34:19.385 --> 34:21.797
Every day, Leon.

34:21.821 --> 34:25.067
You think Mike Franks
is still alive?

34:25.091 --> 34:27.835
I think Mike Franks left
that beach shootout in pieces.

34:27.860 --> 34:30.105
Alejandro's lying
about something,

34:30.129 --> 34:31.607
I just don't know what.

34:31.630 --> 34:32.928
He showed his hand.

34:35.534 --> 34:37.779
I've seen enemies
with vendettas, Leon.

34:37.803 --> 34:40.148
Seen people lose their lives
to them.

34:40.172 --> 34:41.984
People that matter.

34:42.007 --> 34:45.087
Worst enemies are the ones
that hide in plain sight.

34:45.110 --> 34:46.655
The ones we can't arrest.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.690
You know, there's a story
about Humphrey Bogart

34:49.715 --> 34:50.926
on that tour.

34:50.949 --> 34:53.061
Might be apocryphal,
but I hope it's true.

34:53.085 --> 34:56.498
So, he finishes early, he walks
across the street to a bar,

34:56.522 --> 34:58.767
still wearing his costume
and his makeup.

34:58.791 --> 35:00.268
Couple hours later,
the director realizes

35:00.292 --> 35:02.204
he needs Bogie
for one more shot,

35:02.228 --> 35:04.773
so he sends
a production assistant.

35:04.797 --> 35:09.044
Sends a kid to drag Bogie
back onto the cafe set.

35:09.068 --> 35:12.180
The director somehow gets him to
the top of the stairs and says,

35:12.204 --> 35:15.684
"All I need you to do
is look over here and nod."

35:15.708 --> 35:17.300
- That's it?
- That's it.

35:18.978 --> 35:20.889
Bogie nods. One take, he's done.

35:20.913 --> 35:21.957
It's in the movie.

35:21.981 --> 35:23.191
When Victor Laszlo

35:23.215 --> 35:24.993
wants the bandleader
to play "La Marseillaise,"

35:25.017 --> 35:26.917
he looks to Rick for the okay.

35:28.654 --> 35:31.667
It's only the turning point
for the entire character,

35:31.691 --> 35:33.735
where he actually
makes a commitment.

35:33.759 --> 35:35.337
He joins the cause.

35:35.361 --> 35:36.938
All he had to do was nod.

35:36.962 --> 35:39.107
And that started everything.

35:39.131 --> 35:42.210
You didn't get a copy
of Abby's report.

35:42.234 --> 35:43.779
I never saw it.

35:43.803 --> 35:45.747
Decades-old cold case
in Mexico...

35:45.771 --> 35:47.568
that's not really
my business, is it?

35:50.910 --> 35:54.890
Gibbs, if something has
to happen with Alejandro...

35:54.914 --> 35:56.779
you don't have to say a word.

36:19.105 --> 36:21.016
Ceremony?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.350
First thing in the morning.

36:22.374 --> 36:23.752
Then we'll debrief second thing.

36:23.776 --> 36:24.753
It's late.

36:24.777 --> 36:26.188
Go get some rest.

36:26.212 --> 36:28.023
Agent DiNozzo.

36:28.047 --> 36:30.208
I need a minute.

36:39.525 --> 36:41.036
Sharp suit.

36:41.060 --> 36:44.826
You're clearly supposed to be
somewhere in that sharp suit.

36:47.299 --> 36:49.144
It's all right.

36:49.168 --> 36:51.480
Never known you to hang around
the house dressed like that,

36:51.504 --> 36:52.835
Special Agent Gibbs.

36:58.244 --> 37:00.155
What's on your mind?

37:00.179 --> 37:02.443
Do you really believe
in right and wrong?

37:05.751 --> 37:07.496
And enforcing the law?

37:07.520 --> 37:09.164
Putting the bad guys
behind bars?

37:09.188 --> 37:11.090
Protecting and serving?

37:12.558 --> 37:16.238
Why, of all things...

37:16.262 --> 37:18.253
are you a cop?

37:21.534 --> 37:23.578
I hereby...

37:23.602 --> 37:26.848
declare on oath,
that I absolutely

37:26.872 --> 37:28.550
and entirely renounce

37:28.574 --> 37:31.987
and abjure
all allegiance and fidelity

37:32.011 --> 37:33.922
to any foreign

37:33.946 --> 37:35.557
prince, potentate,

37:35.581 --> 37:38.126
state or sovereignty...

37:38.150 --> 37:40.618
We're both sworn representatives
of the law.

37:42.288 --> 37:44.833
And we're both supposed
to uphold the code.

37:44.857 --> 37:46.434
The Constitution

37:46.458 --> 37:49.971
and laws of the United States
of America

37:49.995 --> 37:54.676
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

37:54.700 --> 37:59.514
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.349
That I will bear arms on behalf

38:01.373 --> 38:03.418
of the United States
when required by the law.

38:03.442 --> 38:07.889
That I will perform
noncombatant service

38:07.913 --> 38:10.959
in the Armed Forces
of the United States...

38:10.983 --> 38:13.695
I've got my own code.

38:13.719 --> 38:16.698
No. That doesn't work.

38:16.722 --> 38:19.953
This is the bullet
that should end you.

38:22.127 --> 38:24.339
Do you think I want that?

38:24.363 --> 38:26.408
I didn't ask you to stop it.

38:26.432 --> 38:29.945
What do you want, Allison?

38:29.969 --> 38:31.613
Thank you?

38:31.637 --> 38:34.382
An apology?

38:34.406 --> 38:36.985
Why the hell not?

38:37.009 --> 38:40.956
Because I've got a rule
against it.

38:40.980 --> 38:43.642
Well, it's a stupid rule.

38:44.683 --> 38:46.294
Maybe it is.

38:46.318 --> 38:48.296
And that I take this obligation

38:48.320 --> 38:51.833
freely,
without any mental reservation

38:51.857 --> 38:55.794
or purpose of evasion,
so help me God.

38:59.465 --> 39:02.777
I wanted to know who you were.

39:02.801 --> 39:05.947
Who you are.

39:05.971 --> 39:07.598
As a person.

39:15.881 --> 39:18.645
Speaking as an officer
of the law...

39:20.686 --> 39:22.677
I think we could beat it.

39:37.069 --> 39:39.514
Hola.

39:39.538 --> 39:42.317
Franks.

39:42.341 --> 39:44.252
What's your assignment here?

39:44.276 --> 39:47.255
Director's orders...
observe and report.

39:47.279 --> 39:49.406
I'll take it from here, probie.

39:51.550 --> 39:54.610
I can pull the trigger
with my thumb.

40:05.531 --> 40:06.942
"Number 44.

40:06.966 --> 40:08.710
"First things first.

40:08.734 --> 40:10.512
Hide the women and children."

40:10.536 --> 40:12.547
What is this?

40:12.571 --> 40:14.983
Your idea.

40:15.007 --> 40:18.186
You're actually
writing them down?

40:18.210 --> 40:20.722
Why didn't you start
with number one?

40:20.746 --> 40:23.425
Can't I get anything right?

40:23.449 --> 40:26.585
Sometimes. I guess.

40:40.966 --> 40:43.935
Back again, Marine?

40:45.471 --> 40:47.682
Not anymore.

40:47.706 --> 40:49.050
That's done.

40:49.074 --> 40:50.885
Not what I heard.

40:50.909 --> 40:54.622
No such thing as an ex-Marine.

40:54.646 --> 40:55.924
That's forever.

40:55.948 --> 40:58.212
Right.

40:59.785 --> 41:03.999
Not even gonna ask
where you've been.

41:04.023 --> 41:07.936
Guess the question is:
Where you going?

41:07.960 --> 41:10.360
I don't know.

41:12.031 --> 41:14.609
Look at you...

41:14.633 --> 41:17.879
all self-loathing and misery.

41:17.903 --> 41:20.064
You make me sick.

41:21.907 --> 41:24.119
Come here to mope?

41:24.143 --> 41:27.389
Nope. Came for a job.

41:27.413 --> 41:28.937
My God.

41:31.917 --> 41:35.430
You really want to be a cop,

41:35.454 --> 41:39.934
you got to let a lot
of old stuff go,

41:39.958 --> 41:42.604
learn a lot of new stuff
to take its place.

41:42.628 --> 41:44.721
Think you can do that?

41:48.700 --> 41:51.794
I think I'd be a good cop.

42:26.338 --> 42:28.329
♪ ♪

42:55.367 --> 42:57.579
Can I help you?

42:57.603 --> 43:00.181
Yes, Mr. Gibbs.

43:00.205 --> 43:02.196
I think you can.
