Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:07.355
(phone ringing)

00:08.890 --> 00:10.858
(answering machine clicks)

00:10.859 --> 00:12.827
WOODY (over machine):
Hi, this is Cheers.

00:12.828 --> 00:15.463
Well, it isn't actually Cheers,
it's Woody Boyd.

00:15.464 --> 00:16.697
Cheers is actually the bar,

00:16.698 --> 00:18.733
and as such,
it couldn't be expected to talk.

00:18.734 --> 00:20.201
SAM:
Woody, start again.

00:20.236 --> 00:21.802
WOODY:
Why? I'm doing fine.

00:21.837 --> 00:24.872
Anyway, uh, there's no one here
to take your call right now.

00:24.873 --> 00:26.341
Well, actually,
if you called right now,

00:26.342 --> 00:28.476
we could take your call,
but if you call when you're...

00:28.477 --> 00:29.977
SAM:
Woody, would you cut it out?

00:29.978 --> 00:30.978
It's sounding stupid.

00:30.979 --> 00:31.979
WOODY:
I am not.

00:31.980 --> 00:33.148
W-W-Why do you always treat me

00:33.149 --> 00:34.215
like I don't know
what I'm doing?

00:34.216 --> 00:35.316
SAM:
It sounds stupid, Woody.

00:35.317 --> 00:36.884
WOODY:
It does not.

00:36.918 --> 00:38.753
(machine beeps)

00:38.787 --> 00:40.155
Hi, Sam, this is Woody.

00:40.189 --> 00:41.789
Uh, I guess you were right.

00:41.823 --> 00:44.425
It does sound stupid.

00:44.460 --> 00:45.926
I'll change it tomorrow.

(door opens)

02:00.102 --> 02:01.319
Hey, everybody.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.353
How's it going?

02:02.354 --> 02:03.522
Hey, Norm, look at this.

02:03.523 --> 02:05.557
I just got myself
a brand-new video camera.

02:05.558 --> 02:06.691
Ooh, nice one.

02:06.692 --> 02:07.726
Looks kind of expensive.

02:07.727 --> 02:08.926
Oh, yeah, it is, it is,

02:08.928 --> 02:10.495
but it-it'll pay for
itself in no time at all.

02:10.496 --> 02:12.230
Yeah?
Yeah.

02:12.231 --> 02:14.933
Yeah, I plan to stage
some footage for those programs,

02:14.934 --> 02:16.835
you know, like
America's Funniest Home Videos,

02:16.836 --> 02:19.988
Rescue 911, Nightline,
stuff like that.

02:21.507 --> 02:24.942
Cliff, I don't think
Nightline is staged.

02:24.977 --> 02:26.944
You are so naive.

02:26.979 --> 02:28.746
(door opens)

02:28.798 --> 02:31.482
Good afternoon, everybody.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.151
Hey, Doc.
Hey.

02:33.186 --> 02:34.986
So, what's new?

02:34.988 --> 02:37.138
Got a message
for you here, Fras.

02:37.139 --> 02:38.173
Yeah, here we go.

02:38.174 --> 02:39.441
Shauna called you.

02:39.475 --> 02:40.575
(patrons hoot)

02:40.609 --> 02:43.311
Now, settle down, class.

02:43.346 --> 02:45.347
Shauna is my secretary.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.148
(all hooting)

02:47.233 --> 02:48.433
My temporary secretary.

02:48.434 --> 02:50.318
She's all of 21 years old,
for God's sake.

02:50.319 --> 02:51.486
(all hooting)

02:51.571 --> 02:53.755
Come on, stop it, you guys.

02:53.873 --> 02:55.473
Have a little class, will you?

02:55.507 --> 02:57.391
So you going to
try and bag her?

03:00.946 --> 03:03.314
No, I am not.

03:03.316 --> 03:06.651
Although it's not entirely
out of the realm of reality.

03:06.685 --> 03:10.788
It does seem that the lass
has a... a thing, for Dr. Crane.

03:10.822 --> 03:11.956
(laughs)

03:12.058 --> 03:14.608
(chuckles) Good for you.

03:14.609 --> 03:16.394
Well, I mean, after all,
it's not so hard to believe.

03:16.395 --> 03:17.812
I've been keeping myself
in pretty good shape.

03:17.813 --> 03:20.403
You know, I've been
Nordic Tracking it every night.

03:21.684 --> 03:22.934
Don't you worry, Peter.

03:22.935 --> 03:24.469
Your parents' 50th
anniversary party will go off

03:24.470 --> 03:25.570
without a hitch.

03:25.571 --> 03:26.905
We'll provide
everything you need...

03:26.906 --> 03:28.990
the food, the drinks, the
decorations, the works.

03:28.991 --> 03:30.325
Sign here.

03:30.359 --> 03:32.493
I can't thank you enough
for all your help.

03:32.494 --> 03:34.162
Good, then we'll see
you on Sunday afternoon.

03:34.163 --> 03:36.297
You'll find every
detail will be perfect.

03:36.332 --> 03:39.484
Terrific, now all I
need is a photographer.

03:39.518 --> 03:40.785
Hey, whoa, whoa, hey.

03:40.819 --> 03:41.919
Whoa, whoa.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.053
Excuse me, there, buddy boy.

03:43.054 --> 03:44.589
I, uh, couldn't
help overhearing

03:44.590 --> 03:46.057
that you're looking
for a photographer?

03:46.058 --> 03:47.259
That's right.
Well, you are in luck.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.210
I'm Clifford Clavin,

03:49.244 --> 03:52.013
one of the best camcorder
jockeys in all of Boston.

03:52.014 --> 03:53.714
If you're
in the video business,

03:53.715 --> 03:55.616
why are you dressed
as a mail-man?

03:59.522 --> 04:01.989
Costume party down at
the Directors Guild.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.341
Yeah.

04:03.359 --> 04:04.442
So, what do you say?

04:04.477 --> 04:07.078
You want me to do your
party for, for 50 clams?

04:07.079 --> 04:08.062
Sounds terrific.

04:08.063 --> 04:09.597
I guess I'm pretty lucky
to have run into you.

04:09.598 --> 04:10.598
Yeah.
I'll see you on Sunday.

04:10.599 --> 04:12.767
Hey, you betcha.

04:12.818 --> 04:14.468
Huh, huh, huh?

04:14.502 --> 04:16.303
What do you think, Norm, huh?

04:16.303 --> 04:18.206
It's the beginning of a
whole new career there.

04:18.207 --> 04:19.207
Yeah.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.743
Speaking of which, uh,

04:21.744 --> 04:23.812
I could use an assistant
for my video endeavours.

04:23.813 --> 04:24.846
Uh, what do you say?

04:24.847 --> 04:29.283
I could start you off
at 20, uh, 15 bucks.

04:29.318 --> 04:30.819
15 bucks?

04:30.853 --> 04:32.420
I could use the money.

04:32.454 --> 04:36.791
I've got to get Vera
a Christmas present.

04:36.826 --> 04:41.763
Uh, Christmas was
a couple of weeks ago.

04:41.797 --> 04:43.531
Oh, my.

04:43.565 --> 04:44.615
(door opens)

04:45.601 --> 04:48.369
Hi, Dr. Crane.

04:48.371 --> 04:50.555
Oh, hello, Shauna.

04:50.573 --> 04:52.323
(patrons hoot softly)

04:53.326 --> 04:56.594
You, uh, left some papers
on your desk,

04:56.595 --> 04:57.762
and they looked important,

04:57.763 --> 05:00.198
so I thought
I'd bring them over.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.466
Well, you didn't really...

05:01.467 --> 05:03.735
I mean, these weren't
that important.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.038
There's no need, uh,
these could have waited.

05:06.039 --> 05:06.988
Oh, I-I don't mind.

05:06.989 --> 05:09.123
I-I wasn't doing
anything anyway,

05:09.124 --> 05:10.591
and besides,
it gives me a chance

05:10.592 --> 05:13.594
to see you
outside of the office.

05:13.628 --> 05:16.564
I think you look
even better in here.

05:16.598 --> 05:19.667
Yes, uh, dank
basements flatter me.

05:19.701 --> 05:21.702
(laughing)

05:23.689 --> 05:25.406
(laughing)

05:25.441 --> 05:27.942
Oh, Dr. Crane.

05:27.976 --> 05:29.910
Can I ask you a question?

05:29.912 --> 05:31.529
Well, yes, go right ahead.

05:31.530 --> 05:33.566
Well, this is probably
against the rules,

05:33.567 --> 05:38.252
but would you be
at all interested in,

05:38.287 --> 05:39.354
you know,

05:39.388 --> 05:42.790
seeing each other
outside the office sometime?

05:42.825 --> 05:44.959
(hooting softly)

05:45.044 --> 05:46.845
Uh, well, uh,

05:46.847 --> 05:49.263
oh, uh,

05:49.265 --> 05:52.584
gosh, Shauna, I, uh, you
know, I'm-I'm terribly busy,

05:52.618 --> 05:54.985
and of course there
is my son to think of.

05:54.986 --> 05:56.020
Oh, hey, listen,

05:56.021 --> 05:58.056
I-I don't want to make you
feel uncomfortable.

05:58.057 --> 06:00.175
Um, tell you what.

06:00.176 --> 06:02.010
Let me just go check and see
if you have any messages,

06:02.011 --> 06:04.211
and then I'll be on my way.

06:14.023 --> 06:15.222
Are you crazy?

06:15.223 --> 06:17.391
Did I just hear you turn
down a date with that girl?

06:17.392 --> 06:18.692
Come on, man, reel her in.

06:18.693 --> 06:20.461
Oh, Sam, you don't seem
to understand.

06:20.462 --> 06:23.331
Look, I just came
off a seven-year marriage.

06:23.365 --> 06:26.901
It's hard to...
think of replacing Lilith.

06:26.952 --> 06:30.571
Just go to the morgue
and open any drawer.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.526
Listen, listen, listen, listen.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.563
I'm not, I'm not saying you
got to replace the corp...

06:38.597 --> 06:40.498
replace Lilith.

06:40.532 --> 06:43.734
All I'm saying is, you know,
ask-ask her out on a date.

06:43.803 --> 06:47.938
Well, perhaps...
i-in a few days maybe.

06:47.939 --> 06:48.973
No, come on, do it now.

06:48.974 --> 06:50.341
Ask her right this sec...

06:50.375 --> 06:53.211
I tell you, if you don't,
I'm gonna ask her out.

06:53.245 --> 06:56.214
You got one minute on
the old Sammy clock.

06:56.282 --> 06:59.033
All right, by George,
I'll do it right this minute.

06:59.034 --> 07:00.101
Attaboy.

07:00.102 --> 07:02.036
Frasier Crane
is back in the game.

07:02.038 --> 07:03.671
(laughs)

07:03.706 --> 07:05.239
No messages.

07:05.273 --> 07:08.142
Uh, Shauna, uh,

07:08.176 --> 07:11.478
what you were saying
before, uh,

07:11.497 --> 07:14.799
about our seeing
each other, um...

07:14.834 --> 07:17.151
Well, uh, to put it this way,

07:17.186 --> 07:20.722
uh, about, you know,
you and me, uh...

07:20.756 --> 07:23.657
You got about 30 seconds.

07:26.729 --> 07:30.031
Would you really like
to go out with me?

07:30.032 --> 07:30.965
(chuckles)

07:30.966 --> 07:32.499
You bet I would.

07:32.534 --> 07:34.601
You know, uh, I have an idea.

07:34.636 --> 07:36.304
Instead of going out,

07:36.355 --> 07:38.273
why don't you come
over to my place

07:38.307 --> 07:40.074
for dinner on Sunday night?

07:40.159 --> 07:41.459
Uh, your place?

07:41.494 --> 07:44.328
Uh, well, I'd be delighted.

07:44.363 --> 07:46.865
Uh, can I bring anything-
a dessert maybe?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.816
Oh, no, Dr. Crane.

07:48.850 --> 07:50.385
Don't bring dessert.

07:50.419 --> 07:52.453
I'll take care of that.

07:56.709 --> 07:59.659
You're going to get dessert!
You're going to get dessert!

08:05.935 --> 08:07.651
I told you we're closed.

08:07.686 --> 08:09.336
It's a private party.

08:09.371 --> 08:11.072
Employees only.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.073
Please.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.540
I'll tell them I own the place.

08:13.541 --> 08:14.842
I do it all the time.

08:14.843 --> 08:16.110
For the last time, go home!

08:16.111 --> 08:17.211
Ow!

08:19.148 --> 08:22.750
Carla, will you stop being
rude to the customers?

08:22.784 --> 08:24.552
It was Paul.

08:24.586 --> 08:27.021
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't
see through the glass.

08:27.022 --> 08:28.089
(door opens)

08:28.090 --> 08:30.474
Okay, here we are, Frederick.

08:30.492 --> 08:31.960
(chuckling):
Hey.

08:31.994 --> 08:33.061
It's my pal Freddy.

08:33.062 --> 08:34.328
Go to your Uncle Sammy there.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.331
Here we go.
Oh, Sam.

08:36.332 --> 08:38.499
Listen, I can't thank you
enough for volunteering

08:38.500 --> 08:40.802
to fill in
when the babysitter cancelled.

08:40.836 --> 08:42.937
I mean, if you hadn't offered,

08:42.938 --> 08:44.605
I wouldn't be able
to see Sauna tonight.

08:44.606 --> 08:47.541
I mean, I mean...
Shauna.

08:47.575 --> 08:49.576
Wow, boy,
there's a slip for you!

08:49.577 --> 08:50.611
(Frasier and Sam laugh)

08:50.612 --> 08:51.712
Aw, it's my pleasure.

08:51.714 --> 08:53.598
You're looking good, Freddy.

08:53.599 --> 08:55.499
Okay, now, I brought
some of his toys here.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.234
We've got his,
uh, his choo-choo.

08:57.235 --> 08:58.268
Hmm.

08:58.269 --> 09:01.038
And his blankey.
Mm-hmm.

09:01.106 --> 09:02.440
And his toy soldier.

09:02.441 --> 09:03.507
Here you go.
Ooh, cool.

09:03.508 --> 09:06.343
And, uh-
well, let's see...

09:06.378 --> 09:09.581
bag full of educational crap
that Lilith got him.

09:09.817 --> 09:11.799
Ah.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.136
And his, uh, favourite book
The Runaway Bunny.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.488
You keep that
book away from me.

09:17.522 --> 09:19.090
How come, Carla?

09:19.124 --> 09:20.324
I have eight kids.

09:20.358 --> 09:22.292
I've read that book
a thousand times,

09:22.327 --> 09:25.329
and every time I read it,
I bawl like a baby.

09:25.431 --> 09:28.248
Oh, no kidding.

09:28.249 --> 09:29.634
"Once there was a little bunny

09:29.635 --> 09:31.603
Stop it. No, stop it.
"who wanted to run away..."

09:31.604 --> 09:33.071
(continues reading) Stop it!

09:33.072 --> 09:34.706
Stop it! Stop it!

09:34.740 --> 09:36.874
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it!

09:36.875 --> 09:38.492
Frasier, can I take
Freddy a minute?

09:38.493 --> 09:39.543
Well, of course.

09:39.544 --> 09:40.795
You remember Auntie Rebecca?

09:40.796 --> 09:42.429
Hello.
Good boy, Frederick.

09:42.430 --> 09:44.198
Yeah, take them both,
take them both.

09:44.199 --> 09:45.232
There you go.
Thank you.

09:45.233 --> 09:46.366
All right, Sam, now listen,

09:46.367 --> 09:48.769
here's a list of numbers.

09:48.804 --> 09:50.204
Here's, uh, my beeper.

09:50.238 --> 09:51.906
This is, uh, Shauna's house.

09:51.940 --> 09:54.859
And this is Lilith
at the eco-pod.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.045
They got a telephone
at the eco-pod?

09:58.046 --> 09:59.747
Well, no, it's just
for emergencies,

09:59.748 --> 10:02.283
but, uh, listen, call her,
yank her chain for me.

10:02.317 --> 10:04.685
I won't have a chance
to do it tonight. (laughs)

10:04.686 --> 10:06.855
I'll see if I can get to it.
Thanks. Oh, and, uh,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.472
one other thing I need
to discuss with you.

10:08.473 --> 10:10.708
Very important,
uh, in, uh, private.

10:10.742 --> 10:12.977
Could you just join
me in the men's room?

10:13.011 --> 10:14.712
In the men's room?

10:14.713 --> 10:16.148
That's a little weird, isn't it?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.648
Oh, Sam, get your head

10:17.649 --> 10:19.484
out of the seventh grade
for God's sake!

10:19.485 --> 10:21.853
We're just two men having
a private conversation.

10:21.854 --> 10:22.904
All right, okay.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.188
Well, don't go in with me!

10:24.222 --> 10:26.456
How would that look?!

10:27.443 --> 10:29.310
CLIFF:
Oh!

10:29.328 --> 10:31.212
All right, hey, there you are.

10:31.246 --> 10:33.180
Okay, everybody, just relax.

10:33.181 --> 10:34.165
Don't mind me.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.566
Pretend like I'm not here.

10:35.584 --> 10:37.802
There you are.
Everything's all set.

10:37.803 --> 10:39.937
I took the liberty of making
name tags for everybody.

10:39.938 --> 10:42.239
See? Hello, my
name's Rebecca.

10:42.273 --> 10:45.309
And this one is for you, Peter.

10:45.343 --> 10:47.277
And your name is?

10:47.296 --> 10:48.563
We're all family.

10:48.597 --> 10:50.364
We know each other's names.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.567
Well, let me make one
out for you anyway.

10:52.601 --> 10:55.035
B-I-T-C...

10:56.388 --> 10:58.656
Come on, man.
I got a party out here!

10:58.657 --> 10:59.791
FRASIER:
All right, Sam, please.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.093
This is very important.

11:02.127 --> 11:04.062
(door unlocks)

11:07.616 --> 11:08.766
(hums)

11:17.826 --> 11:19.277
What do you think?

11:19.328 --> 11:21.496
Oh, it's super.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.364
Really?

11:23.365 --> 11:24.331
Oh, you're ser...?

11:24.332 --> 11:26.433
Oh, I'm...
no, I'm sorry.

11:26.467 --> 11:28.903
No, uh... oh, I can't
lie to you, man.

11:28.937 --> 11:30.204
This is just, uh...

11:30.238 --> 11:32.807
Well, it's-it's not you.

11:32.841 --> 11:34.708
(laughs) Damn, you know...

11:34.742 --> 11:37.178
It looked so good
on the Styrofoam head.

11:39.214 --> 11:42.016
Oh, hell, Sam,
who am I trying to kid?

11:42.101 --> 11:44.385
Oh, this is ridiculous.

11:44.419 --> 11:46.487
I'm gonna call
Shauna and cancel.

11:46.521 --> 11:47.888
Oh, well, wait a second.

11:47.889 --> 11:50.023
Wh-What are you doing, man?
She likes you.

11:50.024 --> 11:51.459
Didn't you hear what she said?

11:51.460 --> 11:53.861
"Oh, no, Dr. Crane,
don't bring dessert.

11:53.895 --> 11:55.596
I'll take care of that."

11:55.630 --> 11:58.131
(both laugh)

11:58.167 --> 12:01.385
Oh, I'm just... I'm just
too old to be dating.

12:01.386 --> 12:03.437
Oh, stop it! Come on,
you were a ladies man

12:03.438 --> 12:05.505
before you met Lilith,
weren't you? Well, yeah.

12:05.506 --> 12:06.640
Yeah, you were!

12:06.641 --> 12:07.608
Hey, look at that.
Look at that.

12:07.609 --> 12:09.376
You are
a good-lookin' man.

12:09.461 --> 12:12.196
Well, I'm not exactly a...
a dog.

12:12.231 --> 12:14.114
(chuckling)

12:14.149 --> 12:16.616
Come on. Go over there,
enjoy yourself.

12:16.651 --> 12:18.281
You know, all you've
got to do is

12:18.282 --> 12:20.321
bring a little champagne,
some flowers,

12:20.322 --> 12:21.655
sweet talk her a little bit.

12:21.656 --> 12:23.858
Before you know it,
it's time to go home.

12:23.892 --> 12:26.060
Or maybe, you don't go home.

12:26.094 --> 12:28.062
You know what I mean?
(both laughing)

12:28.063 --> 12:29.663
Is that the way, uh,
most dates go for you, Sam?

12:29.664 --> 12:30.998
No, now come on,
now, don't do that.

12:30.999 --> 12:32.299
See, this is not a test.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.504
You're not expected
to perform at my level.

12:36.321 --> 12:38.272
The thing is just to...

12:38.306 --> 12:40.941
enjoy myself, as myself.

12:40.975 --> 12:43.076
Yes.

12:43.111 --> 12:45.746
Okay. Thanks, Sam.
Yeah, yeah.

12:45.780 --> 12:48.148
Now, Frasier Crane...

12:48.182 --> 12:50.484
is gonna go get some
before it gets cold.

12:50.518 --> 12:52.653
(laughs)

12:53.868 --> 12:56.790
Oh...
Everything okay in here, Sam?

12:56.791 --> 12:58.125
Yeah, yeah,
no problem just, uh,

12:58.126 --> 12:59.860
you know, I had to help
Frasier out with something.

12:59.861 --> 13:02.195
(clicks tongue)

13:02.196 --> 13:03.698
We've got bigger problems, Sam.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.283
Those things are back!

13:14.475 --> 13:16.410
(doorbell chimes)

13:31.710 --> 13:33.727
Well, come on in,
Dr. Crane.

13:33.762 --> 13:34.929
Dinner's on the table.

13:34.963 --> 13:37.197
How old are you, like, 90?

13:45.030 --> 13:49.460
Okay, so this button's
the "on-off" button.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.930
This, uh, this button here
makes it louder or softer.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.215
And these two
buttons right here

13:55.249 --> 13:58.084
make everything
bluer or greener.

13:58.119 --> 13:59.553
Those two are my favourites.

14:00.622 --> 14:01.755
Have a ball there.

14:01.790 --> 14:03.023
Poor kid.

14:03.057 --> 14:05.759
Probably don't let him
watch enough TV at home.

14:05.794 --> 14:07.361
Yeah.

14:07.395 --> 14:10.331
It's a wonder why some
people even have kids. Oh...

14:11.617 --> 14:13.951
Great shot.
Great shot.

14:13.985 --> 14:16.653
Oh! Hey, listen, ma'am,

14:16.654 --> 14:18.255
would you mind holding
this in your lap

14:18.256 --> 14:20.590
and just tilt it up
at an angle like that?

14:20.625 --> 14:23.060
I want to do
a slow tracking shot.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.100
Hi, sexy.

14:30.101 --> 14:32.202
What are you going to be
doing after work tonight?

14:32.203 --> 14:34.805
Trying to forget you
asked me that.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.009
Well, you do great work.

14:39.043 --> 14:40.344
Look for your, uh,

14:40.378 --> 14:43.447
credits in the end titles,
there, sweetheart.

14:45.616 --> 14:48.285
Cliffie, what's this red
blinking light mean?

14:48.286 --> 14:49.954
Oh, that means
the battery's dead.

14:49.955 --> 14:51.288
All right, give me the spare.

14:51.289 --> 14:53.023
I'll slap it in for you.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.648
Actually, I don't, I don't
have a spare there, Norm.

14:55.649 --> 14:57.928
Okay, uh, no problem,
just give me the power cord.

14:57.929 --> 14:59.463
We'll find an outlet.

14:59.497 --> 15:01.007
These come with power cords?

15:02.600 --> 15:04.702
What are you...?
What are you telling me?

15:04.736 --> 15:08.071
That this camera doesn't...
this camera is useless?

15:08.072 --> 15:09.906
These people paid us
good money, Cliff.

15:09.907 --> 15:11.107
What are we going to do?!

15:11.142 --> 15:12.643
Relax, will you, Norm.

15:12.644 --> 15:14.611
We'll-We'll figure
out some kind of a plan.

15:14.612 --> 15:16.681
Well, you'd better
come up with something.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.349
All right, here.
Here's what we'll do. All right.

15:18.350 --> 15:21.618
We'll just carry on and film
as though nothing's wrong.

15:21.619 --> 15:23.120
We'll pretend
the camera's working.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.739
Then in a couple of days
when they call us for the film,

15:25.740 --> 15:27.610
we'll say,
"We dropped it in the mail.

15:27.625 --> 15:28.885
It must have gotten lost."

15:30.462 --> 15:32.429
All right?
We got the 50 bucks,

15:32.464 --> 15:33.798
nobody's the wiser.

15:33.865 --> 15:36.099
Great, great, as long
as you have a plan.

15:36.133 --> 15:38.168
Norm, you know,
in a couple of weeks,

15:38.169 --> 15:39.536
nobody here's gonna remember

15:39.537 --> 15:41.872
some stupid
anniversary party. Yeah.

15:41.906 --> 15:43.273
(clinking)

15:43.342 --> 15:45.092
Attention, everyone!

15:45.094 --> 15:48.662
I've waited
50 years to say this.

15:48.663 --> 15:49.729
Wait a minute, Dad.

15:49.730 --> 15:50.965
Say it into the camera.

15:50.999 --> 15:53.400
We want to preserve
this moment forever.

15:53.468 --> 15:55.736
Hey, guys, come on over!

15:59.340 --> 16:01.742
Okay, coming right up!
Come on, Norm.

16:01.777 --> 16:05.479
Let's go capture this
moment on video tape.

16:05.564 --> 16:08.115
I-I don't know
why it's taken me so long

16:08.149 --> 16:09.683
to say this to you kids,

16:09.717 --> 16:12.619
but I love you,

16:12.654 --> 16:15.389
every one of you.

16:20.712 --> 16:23.263
Cliff, you've got to tell them.

16:23.264 --> 16:25.182
It's not my fault
the guy took 50 years

16:25.183 --> 16:28.268
to tell his kids he loved them.

16:28.302 --> 16:31.571
I mean, what kind
of father is that anyway?

16:31.572 --> 16:33.907
All right, so there was
one moment in the whole thing.

16:33.908 --> 16:35.142
Big whoops.

16:35.143 --> 16:36.910
I mean, you know, with all
the drinking and yelling,

16:36.911 --> 16:38.479
nobody's gonna
remember anything.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.648
Grandma! Grandpa!

16:41.683 --> 16:44.118
I flew 34 hours

16:44.152 --> 16:45.952
in a marine cargo
plane to get here.

16:45.954 --> 16:48.071
But it's worth it all
just to say,

16:48.106 --> 16:50.140
"Happy Anniversary,
I love you!"

16:50.192 --> 16:51.875
(gasping, applause)

16:54.362 --> 16:57.615
Oh, Terry, my baby boy!

16:57.649 --> 17:00.016
Thank God we're getting
this on tape!

17:00.035 --> 17:02.102
(sotto voce):
Yeah, thank God.

17:02.103 --> 17:03.754
My God, Terry.
They wouldn't tell us

17:03.755 --> 17:05.689
if you were alive or dead.

17:05.723 --> 17:08.058
There's one thing
that kept me alive.

17:08.092 --> 17:10.260
I was thinking about
coming home to you.

17:10.295 --> 17:11.829
Oh!
Oh!

17:11.930 --> 17:14.181
All right, Cliff, come on.

17:14.182 --> 17:15.448
What are we gonna do here?

17:15.449 --> 17:16.683
You got to tell them.

17:16.684 --> 17:17.851
All right,
look, look everybody.

17:17.852 --> 17:20.387
My boss here has
an announcement to make.

17:21.622 --> 17:23.857
Uh, yeah, everybody.

17:23.892 --> 17:25.959
I've got to go on my break.

17:25.992 --> 17:27.928
My assistant will take over.

17:29.076 --> 17:31.798
All right, now, let's, uh,

17:31.799 --> 17:33.567
squeeze in tight everybody.

17:43.478 --> 17:45.613
So...

17:45.647 --> 17:49.049
you're, uh, Shauna's family.

17:49.050 --> 17:50.817
You know, when Shauna
invited me for dinner,

17:50.818 --> 17:52.552
she didn't mention
that we'd be having dinner

17:52.553 --> 17:55.222
with her whole family.

17:55.224 --> 17:56.823
(Frasier chuckles)

17:58.593 --> 18:01.362
Interestingly enough,
many young people today

18:01.363 --> 18:03.430
are choosing to move
back in with their parents.

18:03.431 --> 18:06.666
We call it the, uh,
"Full Nest Syndrome."

18:06.685 --> 18:08.251
It wasn't her choice.

18:08.253 --> 18:10.754
Well...

18:10.789 --> 18:13.857
Shauna's made
some bad decisions.

18:13.909 --> 18:16.977
She's not real good
on responsibility.

18:18.596 --> 18:20.397
Well, I must say that she, uh,

18:20.431 --> 18:23.633
she handled herself quite
well this week at my office.

18:23.668 --> 18:26.136
Thank you,
Dr. Crane. See?!

18:27.622 --> 18:29.423
Oh, yeah, Doctor,

18:29.457 --> 18:31.891
I forgot I was getting
a professional opinion.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.410
Where did you go to school?

18:33.461 --> 18:34.544
Harvard.

18:34.596 --> 18:37.264
Well, la-di-da.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.602
And is this what they taught
you at Harvard?

18:41.603 --> 18:43.103
How to take advantage
of my daughter?

18:43.104 --> 18:46.557
Sir, I am not taking advantage.

18:46.591 --> 18:49.275
I was merely invited for an
innocent little dinner.

18:49.310 --> 18:51.311
Oh? Just "an innocent
little dinner"?

18:51.312 --> 18:52.613
Mind if I check your wallet?

18:52.614 --> 18:54.547
There's no need for that!

18:58.385 --> 19:00.087
I don't like this, Shauna.

19:00.121 --> 19:01.622
But why not, Daddy?

19:01.623 --> 19:03.223
Isn't this the kind
of guy that you always

19:03.224 --> 19:04.457
wanted me to date?

19:04.458 --> 19:05.926
Is this the choice you give me?

19:05.927 --> 19:08.696
Either some silver-spoon egghead
or that hippy?

19:08.698 --> 19:10.213
Why are you bringing up Rick?

19:10.248 --> 19:12.883
I thought I was
forbidden to see Rick.

19:14.669 --> 19:16.670
"Rick"?

19:16.755 --> 19:18.305
That's her old boyfriend.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.606
Okay, I get it.

19:19.607 --> 19:22.009
All right, thank you,
Shauna, for inviting me to be

19:22.010 --> 19:23.276
a little pawn in your game.

19:23.277 --> 19:24.945
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'll just be going.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.847
Oh, no,
please stay, Dr. Crane.

19:26.881 --> 19:28.281
Everything is fine.

19:28.316 --> 19:31.218
Everything is just fine.

19:31.269 --> 19:33.119
Uh, Tater Tots?

19:34.522 --> 19:36.523
I don't know
why he likes Shauna.

19:36.558 --> 19:38.792
She's only big up there,
'cause she stuffs.

19:38.794 --> 19:40.677
Shut up, Todd!

19:42.247 --> 19:43.517
He would have found out,

19:43.582 --> 19:45.265
in, like, a year.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.651
Make him shut up!

19:47.702 --> 19:50.420
(motorcycle approaching)

19:50.454 --> 19:51.955
And whom else have we invited

19:51.990 --> 19:53.857
for dinner, tonight, Shauna?

19:53.858 --> 19:55.475
If I'm right
and this is in fact

19:55.476 --> 19:57.646
the worst night of my life,
it would be Rick.

19:57.679 --> 19:59.562
Well, you know that drop-out's

19:59.597 --> 20:00.964
not allowed in this house.

20:01.016 --> 20:02.716
Shauna!

20:02.767 --> 20:04.200
Rick!

20:04.235 --> 20:06.169
You came for me.

20:06.203 --> 20:07.904
You really do love me.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.990
Oh, please.

20:09.992 --> 20:11.742
That's it,
I'm calling the police.

20:11.776 --> 20:13.694
Daddy, why can't you like Rick?

20:13.728 --> 20:15.662
Can't you see that
we're in love?

20:15.697 --> 20:17.463
Don't you run out
on me, Shauna!

20:17.498 --> 20:18.631
I'm your father!

20:18.632 --> 20:19.850
(door slams)
Don't lock that door.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.551
Don't lock that door.
Don't lock that door.

20:21.552 --> 20:22.920
(pounding on door)

20:22.988 --> 20:25.388
I think I'll just be going now.

20:25.423 --> 20:28.959
Why? Everything
is just fine.

20:28.993 --> 20:31.761
It's just fine.

20:31.763 --> 20:35.481
Now, who's got room for dessert?

20:44.626 --> 20:46.493
So I guess, Freddy, uh,

20:46.494 --> 20:48.161
you know what they're
saying is that wherever

20:48.162 --> 20:51.998
the baby bunny goes,
the mommy bunny is...

20:52.032 --> 20:55.068
is there waiting for
him to take care of him.

20:56.604 --> 20:58.534
I guess I, uh,
must have touched my eye

20:58.539 --> 21:00.840
with some of that, uh,
salt from the peanuts.

21:03.144 --> 21:05.312
(crying):
Me, too.

21:05.363 --> 21:06.480
That's it, yeah.

21:06.481 --> 21:07.581
Let's do the good-byes now.

21:07.582 --> 21:09.149
Wave, yes.

21:09.183 --> 21:11.117
See you later.
Had a good time.

21:11.152 --> 21:13.142
We're gonna need
a lot of copies of this.

21:13.154 --> 21:15.054
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, you'll get 'em.

21:15.089 --> 21:16.139
All right, sir.

21:16.157 --> 21:18.191
You'll get those copies,
all right.

21:18.225 --> 21:20.294
We're going to jail, Norm.

21:20.328 --> 21:21.428
What do you mean "we"?

21:21.429 --> 21:22.663
I'm only the assistant here.

21:22.664 --> 21:24.715
(groans)

21:24.749 --> 21:28.185
Everybody,
I have something to say.

21:28.219 --> 21:30.470
I want you all to know that

21:30.505 --> 21:35.074
you have given me the strength
to do this.

21:37.145 --> 21:39.079
(gasping, murmuring)

21:49.607 --> 21:51.492
This is too much, Cliff.

21:51.526 --> 21:54.661
Either you tell them
now, or I'm going to.

21:54.696 --> 21:56.964
Yeah, well, I guess I'd better

21:56.998 --> 21:58.832
before Bigfoot walks in here

21:58.867 --> 22:01.735
and starts singing
"The Anniversary Waltz."

22:02.754 --> 22:05.055
I guess if you give me the tape,
we'll be going.

22:05.089 --> 22:08.008
Oh! So you want
the tape right now?

22:08.042 --> 22:10.677
Uh, I tell you what,
how about if I take

22:10.678 --> 22:12.379
a shot from up here,
one last shot.

22:12.380 --> 22:14.381
Norm, uh...
Everybody, over here!

22:14.415 --> 22:16.316
Turn this way, uh...

22:16.351 --> 22:18.318
let me see those
pearly whites, huh?

22:18.352 --> 22:19.719
Okay, everybody smile.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.388
Okay, we'll just
back it up here, Norm.

22:21.389 --> 22:22.523
Back it up.

22:22.524 --> 22:24.458
(clears throat):
Open the door, Norm.

22:24.459 --> 22:26.193
Okay, back it up.
That's good.

22:26.194 --> 22:27.628
Okay, I'm just
gonna back it up.

22:27.629 --> 22:29.780
Everybody wave, yeah.

22:29.814 --> 22:31.147
Run like hell!

22:44.095 --> 22:46.029
Yahtzee!
(laughing)
