WEBVTT

00:06.048 --> 00:09.619
-Hey.
-Oh.

00:09.652 --> 00:12.522
-Is that baked ziti?
-Yeah.

00:12.555 --> 00:16.593
Hope that's for us and not that
crybaby widower from church.

00:16.626 --> 00:19.762
No, it's for us, but I will let
sweet Mr. Nelson know

00:19.796 --> 00:21.931
you are sorry for his loss.
(chuckles)

00:21.964 --> 00:23.633
(Mike grunts)

00:23.666 --> 00:25.435
This looks great.
Well, whatever you tell him,

00:25.468 --> 00:27.804
just-- this stays here.

00:27.837 --> 00:29.939
Well, this is for our
romantic weekend at the cabin.

00:29.972 --> 00:31.240
-Yeah.
-It's a little something

00:31.274 --> 00:34.210
I like to call
"Sex and the Ziti."

00:34.243 --> 00:36.413
Oh.

00:36.446 --> 00:38.381
You gonna do the puns
all weekend, huh?

00:38.415 --> 00:41.618
Oh, yeah, it's "pastable."
(laughs)

00:41.651 --> 00:45.054
-I'm looking forward to this.
-Mmm. Me, too.

00:45.087 --> 00:47.624
(gags)

00:47.657 --> 00:50.327
Parental displays
of affection. Gross.

00:50.360 --> 00:52.562
Surprised you guys
are still going to the cabin

00:52.595 --> 00:54.297
with Eve coming home
for the weekend.

00:54.331 --> 00:56.599
-What? No, Eve's
not coming home.
-Not this weekend.

00:56.633 --> 00:59.669
Uh, yes, she is.
She posted about it.

00:59.702 --> 01:01.971
Uh, "After another perfect week
at the Academy,

01:02.004 --> 01:04.106
"heading home
for some R&R with fam.

01:04.140 --> 01:07.109
#WorkHardPlayHard.
#BestLife."

01:07.143 --> 01:10.279
Come here. Look at this.
This is weird.

01:10.313 --> 01:12.449
She's even posted a picture
of that basketball game

01:12.482 --> 01:14.517
-I took her to last weekend.
-Let me see.

01:14.551 --> 01:18.455
Oh. "Loving life with Dad
at the Falcons game.

01:18.488 --> 01:20.623
#Family.
#BestLife."

01:20.657 --> 01:22.625
Ugh. She leans pretty hard

01:22.659 --> 01:25.428
-on that "best life" thing.
-Yeah.

01:25.462 --> 01:27.163
Yeah, that's weird
'cause we really didn't have

01:27.196 --> 01:28.831
that good a time
at the basketball game.

01:28.865 --> 01:31.468
Yeah, duh, she wouldn't
actually post that.

01:31.501 --> 01:33.670
You may know about
"rack-and-onion steering,"

01:33.703 --> 01:36.305
but you have a lot to learn
about social media.

01:39.509 --> 01:44.013
Look, I don't drive a vegetable,
I drive a car.

01:44.046 --> 01:45.548
Rack-and-pinion steering.

01:45.582 --> 01:48.418
(laughs) Yeah, that doesn't
make any sense.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.790
You know, I remember,
when you came back

01:53.823 --> 01:55.992
from that game, you said
something seemed off with Eve.

01:56.025 --> 01:57.727
I couldn't get
any information out of her.

01:57.760 --> 02:01.864
The best fun I had at that thing
was eating those three churros.

02:01.898 --> 02:04.300
Three? You said it was four.

02:04.333 --> 02:06.669
Okay, it was...

02:06.703 --> 02:09.472
Actually, uh, five.

02:09.506 --> 02:13.142
But like Olympic scoring, I-I-I
take out the high and the low,

02:13.175 --> 02:14.711
so...

02:14.744 --> 02:16.078
-it was three.
-(door slams)

02:16.112 --> 02:17.480
(groans)

02:17.514 --> 02:18.715
-Hey.
-Oh. Hey.

02:18.748 --> 02:20.583
I didn't know you guys
would still be here.

02:20.617 --> 02:22.519
And we didn't know
you'd be coming here.

02:22.552 --> 02:25.388
Look at us not knowing
what's going on with each other.

02:25.422 --> 02:27.490
-Huh.
-You, uh, you all right?

02:27.524 --> 02:30.092
Yeah, um, I'm gonna go take
a nap. Have fun at the cabin.

02:32.128 --> 02:34.063
Oh, you're right. She's, uh,
she's not saying anything.

02:34.096 --> 02:35.732
Nope.

02:35.765 --> 02:38.401
Now I see why
you ate five churros.

02:38.435 --> 02:41.203
It was, uh, actually six.

02:43.072 --> 02:45.675
If you, if you can eat
five in a row,

02:45.708 --> 02:48.445
they'll give you one free.

02:48.478 --> 02:50.480
*

02:55.384 --> 02:58.755
-Morning.
-Hey, good morning.

02:58.788 --> 03:00.923
-Where are you guys headed?
-Outdoor Man.

03:00.957 --> 03:02.892
I'm going to shadow Kyle
for a school assignment.

03:02.925 --> 03:04.594
I am so excited.

03:04.627 --> 03:06.896
Yeah. Who knew a shadow
could be so fun.

03:06.929 --> 03:09.131
Not just a demon who
follows you on the ground

03:09.165 --> 03:11.000
when the sun is out.

03:12.769 --> 03:15.772
All right, go.
Have fun. Bye, guys.

03:18.975 --> 03:22.211
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Hey, hold on there for a second.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.146
-Huh?
-Come-come talk to me.

03:24.180 --> 03:27.083
Uh... Dad, a little help?

03:27.116 --> 03:29.786
I already gave it a shot.
You two are on your own.

03:29.819 --> 03:34.657
-Okay.
-Okay. Here you go.

03:34.691 --> 03:37.159
Now that it's just us gals,

03:37.193 --> 03:39.596
let's get ready to talk
about some feelings.

03:39.629 --> 03:43.132
Well, I was feeling thirsty,

03:43.165 --> 03:45.401
so I went to the kitchen
for some water,

03:45.434 --> 03:47.069
and now I'm feeling

03:47.103 --> 03:50.406
like I want to turn
the experience into a novel.

03:50.439 --> 03:53.275
No. No, no. Come on.
You seem kind of down.

03:53.309 --> 03:56.846
And-and then you just come home
like this out of the blue.

03:56.879 --> 04:00.182
Mm, can't a girl just come home?

04:00.216 --> 04:02.852
Well, sure, but you don't.

04:02.885 --> 04:04.754
Okay, this is why
I wanted to come home

04:04.787 --> 04:06.122
while you two were gone.

04:06.155 --> 04:07.824
You just try to dig
into my problems.

04:07.857 --> 04:09.592
But, so there's a problem?
Talk to me. What is it?

04:09.626 --> 04:11.093
-No, there's not...
-Let me try to help.

04:11.127 --> 04:12.629
There's not a problem,
and if there was,

04:12.662 --> 04:14.263
I-I don't have to share
every little thing

04:14.296 --> 04:15.498
in my life with my parents.

04:23.806 --> 04:25.374
How'd that go?

04:25.407 --> 04:27.043
I don't have to share
every little thing

04:27.076 --> 04:29.478
she tells me with you.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.316
All right, we'll start
in Mr. B's office.

04:34.350 --> 04:37.319
I usually like to pop in
and say, "Howdy-do,"

04:37.353 --> 04:40.022
and he says, "Get out, Kyle."

04:40.056 --> 04:42.859
And then the day begins.

04:42.892 --> 04:46.328
This is so... professional.

04:46.362 --> 04:48.230
Should I call you Mr. Anderson?

04:48.264 --> 04:52.201
Oh, please, Mr. Anderson
was my father.

04:52.234 --> 04:54.637
Except when he was running
a horse doping scam

04:54.671 --> 04:56.839
out of Nashville.

04:56.873 --> 04:59.508
Then he was just Bobby Syringe.

05:00.877 --> 05:03.145
So, should we move
to the sales floor?

05:03.179 --> 05:06.482
Uh, Kyle, I know you're
super important around here.

05:06.515 --> 05:10.252
I like you. Young people get me.

05:10.286 --> 05:14.724
But because you're so busy,
I don't want to get in your way,

05:14.757 --> 05:18.695
so I'll just set up over here,
and you have a great day.

05:18.728 --> 05:21.698
Set up? What are you
talking about?

05:21.731 --> 05:23.332
Don't worry.

05:23.365 --> 05:26.435
I brought enough books
to keep me occupied for the day.

05:26.468 --> 05:28.705
Oh, also, could you sign this
for my teacher?

05:33.375 --> 05:35.411
Uh, but this says that
we spent the whole day

05:35.444 --> 05:36.846
learning about
the retail business.

05:36.879 --> 05:40.516
Kyle...

05:40.549 --> 05:42.852
when you started
in Human Resources,

05:42.885 --> 05:44.520
what did you study?

05:44.553 --> 05:47.256
Oh, the HR manual,
cover to cover.

05:47.289 --> 05:49.892
Including the covers.

05:49.926 --> 05:52.428
Right, and wouldn't it
have been weird

05:52.461 --> 05:54.530
if they made you study
engineering?

05:54.563 --> 05:56.866
Uh, yeah, I guess.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.902
Although, I do love trains.

05:59.936 --> 06:03.606
(chuckles) So you agree
it's a waste of time

06:03.640 --> 06:06.408
for me to learn about something
I am never going to do.

06:06.442 --> 06:09.812
Maybe, uh, but unless
you shadow me,

06:09.846 --> 06:11.914
it just doesn't feel right
to sign this.

06:13.650 --> 06:16.085
I understand.

06:16.118 --> 06:19.455
Totally unrelated,
could I get your autograph?

06:25.762 --> 06:27.897
Hey, what's up?

06:27.930 --> 06:30.266
Oh, nothing, just hanging out.
Want to join me?

06:30.299 --> 06:32.034
Yeah.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.977
-Hey, guys.
-Mmm. Hey, Kristin.

06:41.010 --> 06:42.845
-Hey, Boyd. Hey, Ryan.
-Oh.

06:42.879 --> 06:45.114
No, uh, they're not with me.

06:45.147 --> 06:46.816
Where are they?

06:46.849 --> 06:48.951
They are on their way to Canada,

06:48.985 --> 06:51.688
so I thought I'd come over
and spend some quality time

06:51.721 --> 06:54.857
-with my little sisters.
-Oh, cool, have a seat.

06:57.994 --> 07:00.629
Uh, how's the Academy
going, Eve?

07:00.663 --> 07:03.666
-Oh, you tell me.
-(phone chimes)

07:03.700 --> 07:06.335
Oh, my God,
you're covered in mud.

07:06.368 --> 07:07.804
Yeah, we just finished
an obstacle course.

07:07.837 --> 07:09.038
I took first place.

07:09.071 --> 07:12.374
Okay, so when you rinsed it off,
was your skin smoother?

07:12.408 --> 07:15.511
I've been considering that.

07:15.544 --> 07:18.447
(coughs)

07:18.480 --> 07:22.451
Guys, look, your sister's here.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.920
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

07:25.888 --> 07:27.289
Just me.

07:27.323 --> 07:30.659
(laughs) Do you guys
follow The Real Megan?

07:30.693 --> 07:32.628
Oh, yes.
She's blowing up right now.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.196
Oh, my God,
look at how cute her dog is.

07:34.230 --> 07:36.332
Oh, so cute.

07:36.365 --> 07:39.736
Listen, you know,
you guys are in the same room.

07:39.769 --> 07:44.073
You don't need to bounce signals
off satellites.

07:44.106 --> 07:45.975
(phone chimes)

07:46.008 --> 07:49.846
You're right, that's so Dad.

07:49.879 --> 07:53.149
-Kris showed up with her phone.
-Oh.

07:53.182 --> 07:56.652
Good. Maybe Eve will tell
her sisters what's going on.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.356
Not unless Megan's dog
has it written on its hoodie.

08:00.389 --> 08:01.758
All right, well,

08:01.791 --> 08:03.659
I got everything
packed up for the cabin.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.728
Uh, can you think of
anything else we might need?

08:05.762 --> 08:08.197
As a matter of fact,
three things.

08:08.230 --> 08:11.700
-Yeah.
-Ding one, ding two,
and ding three.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.843
Hey, listen, guys, uh,
we're gonna head to the cabin.

08:20.877 --> 08:23.545
-Does anybody else
want to go with us?
-MANDY: Uh, no thanks.

08:23.579 --> 08:25.414
I was gonna get tapas
with my friends.

08:25.447 --> 08:27.850
We like to pretend the little
plates are normal-sized

08:27.884 --> 08:30.953
and we're giants.

08:30.987 --> 08:33.622
Yeah, uh, Ryan and Boyd
are in Canada,

08:33.655 --> 08:36.625
so I'm gonna do
absolutely nothing. (chuckles)

08:36.658 --> 08:38.928
Believe me, when you have
a husband and a 12-year-old boy,

08:38.961 --> 08:41.630
doing nothing is everything.

08:41.663 --> 08:44.033
Yeah, if they're not going,
I'm not going.

08:44.066 --> 08:47.069
I'm quiet, and you guys
are not discreet.

08:49.839 --> 08:51.808
Uh-huh.
Yeah, no, we get it, we get it.

08:51.841 --> 08:54.710
I mean, your dad and I go there
to unplug, enjoy nature,

08:54.743 --> 08:57.713
and, you know, I guess you guys
just aren't into that.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.548
Yeah, you can't leave
your little toys.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.283
What is that supposed to mean?

09:01.317 --> 09:03.119
We don't mean it as an insult.
It's just that,

09:03.152 --> 09:06.122
uh, you know, studies have shown
that your generation

09:06.155 --> 09:08.490
just can't live without
your little gadgets.

09:08.524 --> 09:10.492
(laughs) Studies have shown
that your generation

09:10.526 --> 09:12.461
ruined the environment.

09:15.697 --> 09:17.633
Yeah, and, you know,
we-we love our gadgets,

09:17.666 --> 09:19.635
but we don't need them.

09:19.668 --> 09:21.437
They're like parents.

09:23.039 --> 09:25.174
If you don't need them,
prove it.

09:25.207 --> 09:27.076
-Yeah.
-Come to the cabin with us.

09:27.109 --> 09:30.012
Hey, hey, hey, I don't need
to miss out on tiny tapas

09:30.046 --> 09:32.614
just to prove something
to you I already know.

09:32.648 --> 09:34.616
How about I make it
more interesting?

09:34.650 --> 09:36.785
You guys come to the cabin
this weekend,

09:36.819 --> 09:38.654
I'll pay each one of you
500 bucks.

09:38.687 --> 09:41.157
Keep talking.

09:41.190 --> 09:44.693
-Under one condition.
-Stop talking.

09:44.726 --> 09:47.029
You come to the cabin with us

09:47.063 --> 09:49.765
and you don't look at your
screens for the whole weekend.

09:49.798 --> 09:52.201
Piece of cake.
I'm a disciplined member

09:52.234 --> 09:56.038
of this country's
armed services, and I'm broke.

09:56.072 --> 09:58.975
Yeah, and I'm telling Boyd to
put down his phone all the time.

09:59.008 --> 10:01.510
I'm not crazy enough
to offer him 500 bucks,

10:01.543 --> 10:03.846
but since you are...

10:03.880 --> 10:05.381
Mandy?

10:05.414 --> 10:08.851
Yeah, I'm in. I'm just
getting it out of my system.

10:08.885 --> 10:12.488
Just to be clear, any one of you
break, the deal is done, okay?

10:12.521 --> 10:14.356
Deal. But we don't take Mandy.

10:14.390 --> 10:16.325
KRISTIN:
Yeah, no.

10:16.358 --> 10:18.160
-What?
-All right, fine, fine.

10:18.194 --> 10:20.029
I'll turn it off.

10:24.700 --> 10:27.536
Uh, I don't have any idea
how to do that.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.377
-(knocks)
-Hey, Mr. Alzate.

10:35.411 --> 10:37.346
I'm busy, Kyle.
Make it quick.

10:37.379 --> 10:40.216
Oh, uh, okay, uh, you know, I
don't need to bother you, then.

10:40.249 --> 10:42.151
No, come in, come in.
I'm not busy. Come in.

10:42.184 --> 10:44.320
It just seemed rude to say,
"Make it quick," without saying,

10:44.353 --> 10:45.654
"I'm busy," that's all.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.756
What's up? What's up?

10:47.789 --> 10:49.525
Okay, um...
(clears throat)

10:49.558 --> 10:52.094
If you know someone is using you
to get away with something,

10:52.128 --> 10:54.530
and you know what
they're doing is wrong,

10:54.563 --> 10:56.398
but they're not a bad person...

10:56.432 --> 11:00.236
Sooner or later you have to
finish a sentence, Kyle.

11:00.269 --> 11:01.837
Uh, yeah, right, okay.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.672
So, you know, Jen is
supposed to be shadowing me,

11:03.705 --> 11:05.507
but she isn't,
and now she wants me to sign

11:05.541 --> 11:07.009
a piece of paper
that says she did.

11:07.043 --> 11:08.677
You don't have to sign it.
You don't have to sign that.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.013
(sighs) Thank you.
It just felt wrong.

11:11.047 --> 11:14.616
-I signed it.
-What?

11:14.650 --> 11:16.752
She came in with a piece
of paper-- yakety-yak--

11:16.785 --> 11:19.288
asked me to sign it--
yakety-yak-- I did.

11:19.321 --> 11:20.856
Well, did you even read it?

11:20.889 --> 11:22.524
I didn't have to.
She's a nice kid.

11:22.558 --> 11:24.326
I had a pen.
It all worked out.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.063
So, what-what's your problem?

11:27.096 --> 11:29.565
That she's getting credit
for something she didn't do.

11:29.598 --> 11:31.767
Come on, now. Come on.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.070
That happens all the time.

11:34.103 --> 11:36.973
What, you think George Foreman
invented that grill?

11:37.006 --> 11:41.443
Huh? The man got punched
in the head by Muhammad Ali.

11:41.477 --> 11:42.945
-(chuckles)
-It just seems wrong, you know.

11:42.979 --> 11:44.813
-That's all.
-All right, look at it this way.

11:44.846 --> 11:46.882
-She's here to learn
about America, right?
-Yes.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.918
What's more American
than gaming the system?

11:49.952 --> 11:52.955
-I guess, but it kind of feels
like she should have...
-(chuckles)

11:55.992 --> 11:57.826
(rapid clicking)

12:01.430 --> 12:03.332
Do you have to click that pen?!

12:03.365 --> 12:06.602
Is it making it hard for you
to look at the pictures?

12:06.635 --> 12:08.137
KRISTIN:
Guys,

12:08.170 --> 12:09.838
don't snap at each other.

12:09.871 --> 12:11.873
We are here to relax.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.417
Hey, hey. Hi.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.352
You girls having fun together?

12:23.385 --> 12:25.921
-Oh, yeah, best time ever.
-Yeah. Oh.
-Yeah, fine.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.357
So, uh, how you doing without
your, without your phones?

12:28.390 --> 12:29.458
-Oh, easy.
-So...
-No problem.

12:29.491 --> 12:30.792
-Killing it.
-Good, good.

12:30.826 --> 12:33.529
-Yeah.
-Well, good. Enjoy yourselves.

12:33.562 --> 12:35.664
(Eve sighs)

12:35.697 --> 12:37.833
Did you just hear her?
I can't believe those two

12:37.866 --> 12:39.468
thought we wouldn't be able
to last the weekend

12:39.501 --> 12:41.037
-without our phones.
-Yeah. (chuckles)

12:41.070 --> 12:43.539
This is gonna be the easiest
money I have ever made.

12:43.572 --> 12:46.442
And I once played poker
with Kyle.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.444
Yeah, it's so easy.

12:48.477 --> 12:51.380
Yes, who needs
their stupid phones?

12:51.413 --> 12:54.883
You know, the stereotype that
our generation is always glued

12:54.916 --> 12:58.620
to our phones, our devices,
it's so ridiculous.

12:58.654 --> 13:01.057
You know what it is?
It's ageist.

13:01.090 --> 13:05.361
Yeah, it's just like old people
to be ageist.

13:08.230 --> 13:10.032
Where are you going?

13:10.066 --> 13:12.801
I was just gonna clear my mind,
get some fresh air,

13:12.834 --> 13:14.803
read the newspaper.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.638
-Give me that. Give me.
-No. What are you doing?

13:16.672 --> 13:18.174
What are you doing?
I'm just gonna relax

13:18.207 --> 13:20.176
-and read the local obituaries.
-Give me that. Give me that.

13:20.209 --> 13:22.578
(Eve gasps, Kristin shouts)

13:22.611 --> 13:25.681
-R-Really, Mandy?
-You almost cost me 500 bucks.

13:25.714 --> 13:28.817
It's not worth it.
I'm in hell.

13:28.850 --> 13:30.919
It's been 20 minutes.

13:30.952 --> 13:33.389
Well, how would I know that?
I don't have my phone.

13:33.422 --> 13:34.990
-Whoa. Hey.
-Wait, no, no, no. G-Give me.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.592
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Give me your...

13:36.625 --> 13:38.060
Get it together, Mandy!

13:39.395 --> 13:41.897
You are better than this.

13:41.930 --> 13:43.265
EVE:
Hey.

13:43.299 --> 13:45.000
-Hit her again!
-Don't.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.735
No, no, no, no, no! Okay.

13:46.768 --> 13:48.537
Okay. Look.

13:48.570 --> 13:51.173
(panting)
I'm sorry.

13:51.207 --> 13:54.376
Got a little crazy there. Whew.

13:54.410 --> 13:56.112
-Just relax.
-(Kristin sighs)

13:56.145 --> 13:58.114
Let's just go back to
what we were doing originally.

13:58.147 --> 14:02.351
Yeah. We can do this, guys,
if we just stick together. Okay?

14:02.384 --> 14:04.586
Yeah. Fine.

14:04.620 --> 14:07.022
Yeah.

14:07.055 --> 14:11.493
I'll just, uh, do what people
did in the "olden days."

14:14.263 --> 14:16.665
Stare at the ceiling till I die.

14:22.471 --> 14:23.705
KYLE:
Come on.

14:23.739 --> 14:24.773
This will just take a second.

14:24.806 --> 14:26.842
(speaking Mandarin)

14:30.179 --> 14:32.047
Okay, I don't know
what any of that means,

14:32.080 --> 14:35.384
but I bet a few of them
were curse words.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.820
Well, I counted three.
What's up?

14:38.854 --> 14:40.822
-All right,
I've made a decision.
-Hmm.

14:40.856 --> 14:43.892
Jen's assignment was to shadow
a representative of Outdoor Man.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.128
-ED: Mm-hmm.
-And that's exactly
what she's gonna do.

14:46.162 --> 14:48.564
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, come on, man.

14:48.597 --> 14:52.067
Mr. Alzate, you're the boss.
Can't you just fire him?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.002
You just follow him around
for a few hours.

14:54.035 --> 14:56.172
You might learn a few things.
What's the harm?

14:56.205 --> 14:58.674
Well, as much as I would love
to show Jen around,

14:58.707 --> 15:00.676
which would've been fun--
that's right,

15:00.709 --> 15:04.646
there were prizes
hidden everywhere--

15:04.680 --> 15:08.083
I can't, because I'm not
the one who signed the paper.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.652
Watch yourself.

15:10.686 --> 15:12.754
So, Mr. Alzate

15:12.788 --> 15:16.658
will be your shadow,
uh, caster or...

15:16.692 --> 15:20.529
maker-- no,
your-your shadow guy.

15:20.562 --> 15:23.199
I thought you would
be cool about this.

15:23.232 --> 15:26.202
Oh, I am cool. But you know
what's not cool? Lying.

15:26.235 --> 15:28.036
And the person
who taught me everything

15:28.069 --> 15:30.506
taught me that a man
is only as good as his word.

15:32.541 --> 15:35.711
Well, I have certainly
learned a lesson,

15:35.744 --> 15:40.148
and I can't imagine learning any
more than I already have today.

15:40.182 --> 15:42.451
Thank you, gentlemen.

15:42.484 --> 15:45.687
Jen, just one small thing
before-before you go.

15:45.721 --> 15:47.289
Uh, uh...
(clears throat)

15:47.323 --> 15:49.124
Brick-and-mortar retail
has long been

15:49.157 --> 15:51.126
the heartbeat
of this country's commerce.

15:51.159 --> 15:53.028
Now, you might want
to take some notes here.

15:53.061 --> 15:56.665
All right, rugged merchants
had set up posts

15:56.698 --> 16:00.101
up and down the rivers and
byways of this country, right?

16:05.707 --> 16:07.809
What are you
thinking about, Mandy?

16:07.843 --> 16:10.145
Philosophy.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.582
If you look perfect in the
woods, and can't post a picture,

16:13.615 --> 16:15.617
does it even matter?

16:17.686 --> 16:20.522
You doing okay, Eve?

16:20.556 --> 16:23.259
Yeah. You?

16:23.292 --> 16:26.495
No. It hurts.

16:26.528 --> 16:28.830
Yeah, that's good,
'cause I was lying.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.400
I've been feeling
phantom buzzes in my pocket

16:31.433 --> 16:34.035
for the past two hours.

16:34.069 --> 16:38.006
I say we give up, guys.
Let's just admit Dad was right.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.409
We should have realized
he would only offer to pay us

16:40.442 --> 16:42.744
for something he knew
we couldn't do.

16:42.778 --> 16:44.280
(sighs)

16:44.313 --> 16:46.348
Dad?

16:46.382 --> 16:48.116
I just hope
the world is still there

16:48.149 --> 16:49.751
when we try to reconnect to it.

16:49.785 --> 16:52.288
Yeah?

16:52.321 --> 16:54.022
Hey.

16:54.055 --> 16:58.760
Why do I get the idea
I'm about to save me some money?

16:58.794 --> 17:01.463
Oh, good.
We thought you would rub it in.

17:01.497 --> 17:04.232
(sighs) I want to see
pictures of my kid, okay?

17:04.266 --> 17:07.035
And slingshot birds into pigs.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.871
Yeah, you win, Dad. So let's
just say we-we get our phones,

17:09.905 --> 17:13.375
and, how about, uh, like,
200 each, and let's end this.

17:13.409 --> 17:16.545
Okay. To be honest with you,
you guys lasted longer

17:16.578 --> 17:18.380
than I thought you would.
Here you go.

17:18.414 --> 17:22.284
Well, you were right, and we all
know how happy that makes you.

17:22.318 --> 17:23.919
You know what'd actually
make me happy?

17:23.952 --> 17:26.488
If my kids would talk
to each other if one of them

17:26.522 --> 17:28.490
was going through something.

17:28.524 --> 17:32.828
But being right
is clearly always a thrill.

17:35.697 --> 17:37.499
-That was weird.
-Hmm.

17:37.533 --> 17:39.234
"Going through something"?

17:39.267 --> 17:40.969
Anyone know
what he's talking about?

17:42.971 --> 17:46.842
O-Okay, fine.
He was talking about me.

17:46.875 --> 17:48.610
You?

17:48.644 --> 17:51.179
Uh, no, I don't think so, Mandy.

17:51.212 --> 17:54.182
Yes, it was me.

17:54.215 --> 17:58.253
(sighs) When you came home,
he asked if I had talked to you.

17:58.286 --> 18:01.256
I've been having some trouble
with my business lately,

18:01.289 --> 18:04.660
and he knows that talking to you
makes me feel more confident.

18:04.693 --> 18:06.662
Well, I love hearing
that I'm helpful to you,

18:06.695 --> 18:09.264
but I don't think it was you
that he was talking about.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.298
(Kristin sighs)

18:10.332 --> 18:13.268
It wasn't. It was me.

18:13.301 --> 18:15.371
What?

18:15.404 --> 18:18.974
You? Kristin, there are days
I wish I was you.

18:19.007 --> 18:21.610
Except for the Ryan part.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.712
You're a kick-ass woman.

18:23.745 --> 18:26.848
Yeah, well, most days,
it feels like my ass

18:26.882 --> 18:29.284
is the one getting kicked.
(chuckles)

18:29.317 --> 18:32.454
And when I talk to Dad about it
at work, he just says,

18:32.488 --> 18:35.491
"You know, you should really
let your sisters in on this."

18:37.893 --> 18:40.295
And he's right.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.830
You're lucky to be
down at the Academy.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.231
-You miss all this drama.
-(Kristin chuckles)

18:43.264 --> 18:44.733
Actually, I don't.

18:44.766 --> 18:47.335
There's plenty of stuff
that goes on down there.

18:47.369 --> 18:50.038
And that's why Dad
was talking about me.

18:50.071 --> 18:52.808
-You?
-Like what? W-What's going on?

18:52.841 --> 18:55.544
(sighs) Well, I came home this
weekend because I didn't want

18:55.577 --> 18:59.515
to sit in my dorm room again
alone on a Friday night.

18:59.548 --> 19:01.417
Well, then you should
start dating.

19:01.450 --> 19:04.052
Ooh.

19:04.085 --> 19:07.523
Yeah. You would think, the three
to one male-to-female ratio,

19:07.556 --> 19:09.758
I could meet a guy.

19:09.791 --> 19:14.663
(chuckles) Honey, do you know
how incredible you are?

19:14.696 --> 19:16.565
How strong?

19:16.598 --> 19:19.501
It is gonna take
one hell of a confident man

19:19.535 --> 19:22.438
to stand alongside that.

19:22.471 --> 19:25.073
But I promise you,
he's out there somewhere.

19:25.106 --> 19:27.543
-And he is frickin' hot.
-(Kristin chuckles)

19:27.576 --> 19:30.011
(chuckles)

19:30.045 --> 19:34.215
Ah, look at us,
talking like sisters.

19:34.249 --> 19:37.619
Yeah. Turns out, there's
actually plenty to talk about.

19:37.653 --> 19:40.355
Yeah, it's great.

19:40.388 --> 19:42.758
Oh, I just realized something.

19:42.791 --> 19:45.393
I think we still get the $500.

19:53.068 --> 19:55.437
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man,

19:55.471 --> 19:57.238
coming to you
over your favorite device,

19:57.272 --> 20:00.275
whether it be a smartphone,
laptop, tablet, or even a watch.

20:00.308 --> 20:02.711
Marshall McLuhan once said,
"We shape our tools,

20:02.744 --> 20:05.313
and thereafter,
our tools shape us."

20:05.346 --> 20:08.550
These days, our tools are
bending us into this shape.

20:08.584 --> 20:10.552
I call it the millennial.

20:10.586 --> 20:12.420
Just look at this slouch
right here.

20:12.454 --> 20:14.623
"How you doing?

20:14.656 --> 20:18.059
"Oh, God, look at that.
Is that the sun?

20:18.093 --> 20:20.962
"I ca... I can't see.
I'll just google the sun.

20:20.996 --> 20:23.164
I'll see it there."

20:23.198 --> 20:24.933
Look, I'm not
bashing technology.

20:24.966 --> 20:27.402
I mean, I'd bash it
if I worked at a library,

20:27.435 --> 20:29.237
but technology has given us
unlimited means

20:29.270 --> 20:31.072
to stay in contact
with each other.

20:31.106 --> 20:33.809
Look at that.
Texting my brother right there.

20:33.842 --> 20:36.745
"Go Broncos," with a turd emoji.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.146
Yeah.

20:38.179 --> 20:40.181
It's also a great way
to learn stuff.

20:40.215 --> 20:43.251
You can go to YouTube
and find a how-to video

20:43.284 --> 20:47.022
to learn how to recover
something you swallowed.

20:47.055 --> 20:50.391
The key is just be patient.

20:52.628 --> 20:56.231
It'll all come out
in the end. That's it.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.370
Anyway, the problem is
when this is the only way

21:02.403 --> 21:04.673
to stay in touch, because
nothing replaces a conversation

21:04.706 --> 21:06.642
with real people,
a real experience.

21:06.675 --> 21:08.844
At Outdoor Man,
we don't sell virtual tents

21:08.877 --> 21:10.679
so you can go virtual camping.

21:10.712 --> 21:13.448
With virtual camping, you might
not get eaten by mosquitos,

21:13.481 --> 21:16.384
but you won't get the peace
that comes with being outside.

21:16.417 --> 21:18.687
We want you to take the time
to occasionally put down

21:18.720 --> 21:21.456
your device, pick up some bug
spray, go sit around a campfire

21:21.489 --> 21:25.126
with someone you care about,
swat your arm, and just talk.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.696
Now, Marshall McLuhan also said,

21:27.729 --> 21:31.466
"I don't necessarily agree
with everything I said."

21:31.499 --> 21:35.236
This is where he and I differ.

21:35.270 --> 21:38.506
Go Broncos. Baxter out.

21:40.041 --> 21:41.476
(chicken clucks)

21:41.509 --> 21:43.511
