ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is the story of two sisters:</i>

00:07.640 --> 00:11.395
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:11.600 --> 00:15.958
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.160 --> 00:17.753
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:17.960 --> 00:20.794
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.000 --> 00:23.560
<i>is that she would set it</i>
<i>all to music.</i>

00:24.880 --> 00:28.396
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.200 --> 00:34.352
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.160 --> 00:37.753
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:41.795
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem</i>
<i>to be too crazy about her.</i>

00:42.000 --> 00:45.391
<i>As you can see, the Campbells</i>
<i>don't have nearly as much money</i>

00:45.600 --> 00:46.750
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:47.480 --> 00:51.235
<i>They do, however,</i>
<i>have as many secrets.</i>

00:54.920 --> 00:55.920
[♪♪♪]

00:56.080 --> 00:57.201
<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:57.240 --> 00:59.630
<i>Chief Tinkler informed the Tates</i>
<i>and the Campbells</i>

00:59.840 --> 01:01.911
<i>that they are all suspects</i>
<i>in the murder</i>

01:02.120 --> 01:04.032
<i>of Peter Campbell, the tennis pro,</i>

01:04.239 --> 01:08.314
<i>because all of them had a motive</i>
<i>and most of them don't have an alibi.</i>

01:08.520 --> 01:11.080
<i>Chester, who knew Jessica</i>
<i>had had an affair,</i>

01:11.280 --> 01:13.431
<i>but didn't know who</i>
<i>she had her affair with,</i>

01:13.640 --> 01:15.597
<i>found out her affair</i>
<i>had been with Peter.</i>

01:16.120 --> 01:17.759
<i>Of course, before his death.</i>

01:17.960 --> 01:23.194
<i>Confused? You won't be</i>

01:26.360 --> 01:30.593

01:39.080 --> 01:41.231
Well, Chester, I just can't believe it.

01:41.440 --> 01:45.719
I mean, Chester,
to think that one of our own relatives
might be a murderer.

01:45.920 --> 01:46.920
A murderer.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.757
I mean, I spent the whole evening
with a murderer,
I fed dinner to a murderer.

01:52.280 --> 01:56.513
Actually, I might be living in
the same house with a murderer.

01:56.720 --> 01:59.474
Chester, who do you think did it?

01:59.680 --> 02:02.320
Who could have done it?
Who cares, Jessica?

02:03.840 --> 02:07.311
After what I learned this evening,
I couldn't care less about a murder.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.670
Oh, what did you learn?

02:13.440 --> 02:15.671
Oh, that. Heh.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.678
Yes, that.
Uh-huh.

02:17.880 --> 02:21.954
Uh, Chester, do you think that we
are talking about the same "that"?

02:22.160 --> 02:24.550
I think so.
Uh-huh.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.319
You're talking about that "that",

02:26.520 --> 02:29.319
that has something to do
with me and, uh, someone else?

02:29.520 --> 02:31.796
That's right.
Oh, that. Oh.

02:32.000 --> 02:36.119
Yeah, well, that is the "that" that
I thought that you were talking about.

02:36.680 --> 02:39.798
Well, Chester, I...
I don't see what the big deal is.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.074
I mean, I told you I had had an affair.
I mean, you did know about it.

02:44.280 --> 02:46.511
But I didn't know who, Jessica.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.713
I didn't know who you
were having your affair with.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.879
Well, I... I should think
it would come as a relief.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.150
Relief?
Yes.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.919
Doesn't it make you feel better
to know

02:56.120 --> 02:59.079
that I had an affair
with someone who's dead?

02:59.560 --> 03:01.631
I... I mean, someone who's dead now.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.230
I mean, it should make it
much easier, Chester.

03:04.440 --> 03:06.477
You'll never bump into each other
at a party.

03:06.680 --> 03:10.435
And you'll never have to look at him
and picture, uh...

03:18.920 --> 03:22.311
I assumed, Jessica, when you told me
you were having an affair

03:22.520 --> 03:27.959
that at least, at the very least,
you were having a dignified one.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.879
But to discover
that you were robbing the cradle...

03:33.080 --> 03:34.594
Do you know how that looks?

03:34.800 --> 03:37.190
Do you know
what people say about that?

03:37.400 --> 03:41.440
Well, when men do it
they say "congratulations."

03:41.640 --> 03:44.474
That's something else entirely,
Jessica.

03:44.680 --> 03:49.197
Young girls
are attracted to older men.
It's a known fact.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.278
We can't help it.

03:52.360 --> 03:56.036
Yes, you can. You could say no.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.120
He was a boy. An absolute boy.
Ha-ha.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.757
It must have been wonderful.
I'm sure you had a lot to talk about.
Ha-ha.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.077
No, we didn't. Heh.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.154
Well, I wouldn't think so.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.511
A... Actually, there was never
very much time.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.720
I mean, you know,
it is kind of hard to talk and...

04:14.800 --> 04:16.870
Uh... Spare me.

04:17.079 --> 04:19.276
At the same time.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.553
Well, Chester, I'm sorry.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.434
Well, must have been exciting, huh?
Heh.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.951
Of course,
a young, good-looking guy.

04:28.160 --> 04:32.552
Probably knows all kinds
of tricks they're doing these days.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.357
They've got all these new books.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.439
Well, Chester, it didn't last long.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.757
When I was growing up,
we didn't have books.

04:40.960 --> 04:43.794
There was one way to do it.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.037
Chester, are you jealous?

04:46.240 --> 04:50.359
I mean, the guy has got energy. Heh.
And tricks.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.438
How can you compete?

04:52.640 --> 04:55.235
He grew up on <i>Penthouse.</i>

04:55.440 --> 04:58.751
I grew up on <i>National Geographic.</i>

04:59.720 --> 05:02.519
Why should I know
as much as he does?

05:02.720 --> 05:05.440
Chester, I'm here.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.279
Look at me.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.472
I'm here.
Of course you're here.

05:09.680 --> 05:10.830
He's dead.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.717
Well, I was still here
when he was alive.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.277
Now you know how I felt
all those years, Chester.

05:20.480 --> 05:21.960
You felt this way?

05:22.160 --> 05:25.153
Mm. Every time.

05:26.160 --> 05:29.039
And it was an awful lot
of times, Chester.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.799
Feels awful.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.514
I know.

05:32.720 --> 05:37.431
Sometimes I felt so awful,
I thought I was going to throw up.

05:38.920 --> 05:44.200
Except, of course, I hate to throw up.
I haven't thrown up since 1948.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.316
I don't think I've ever
felt like this before.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.034
I know.

05:50.240 --> 05:52.197
[♪♪♪]

05:52.560 --> 05:54.916
I'm sorry, Jess.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.760
I'm sorry you ever had
to feel this way.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.477
I'm really sorry.

06:01.960 --> 06:06.034
Chester, let's try

06:06.240 --> 06:09.631
never to make each other
feel this way again. Hmm?

06:20.240 --> 06:21.993
Thank you.

06:23.120 --> 06:25.760
Boy, it sure is quiet around here.

06:25.960 --> 06:29.112
Hey, guys, what's the matter?
Did somebody die? Ha-ha-ha.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.910
[ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY]

06:33.120 --> 06:34.120
Take it easy, Burt.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.994
Come on. Don't you have any
feelings? He was your brother.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.351
It wasn't my brother, you idiot.
It was his.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.473
Don't call my father an idiot.

06:42.840 --> 06:44.559
Excuse me.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.391
I'm sorry, Dad.
It's all right.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.193
It's all right. It's all right.
No, I'm all right.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.040
I'm all right, I'm all right.
I'm all right.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.800
Boy, you never know what life
has in store for you, huh?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.480
I mean, you just never know.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.149
Only a few days ago,
I'm the happiest guy in the world.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.080
And now today, I couldn't be sadder.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.033
I know, dear.
I don't know.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.976
I don't know. Maybe God looked down
and said:

07:06.000 --> 07:09.152
"Hey, uh, Campbell's too happy.
Let's cool him down. Kill his son."

07:09.360 --> 07:11.431
I don't know, I don't know.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.790
Well, I don't know.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.151
I mean, I don't know
what the world has come to.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.999
When someone in one's own family,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.669
is murdered by someone else
in someone's own family.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.839
Jessica, please, enough of this.
Nobody...

07:23.040 --> 07:25.874
Nobody killed anybody.
Oh, yeah?

07:26.080 --> 07:29.756
Well, somebody better tell Peter.
They buried him the other day.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.877
Peter was stabbed, shot, strangled,
suffocated and bludgeoned.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.595
Do you seriously think
that one of us could've done it? Heh.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.680
For God's sake, nobody in this family
could sit through <i>The Exorcist.</i>
Heh-heh.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.280
That's right.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.598
I just wonder if any of the Campbells
could sit through it.

07:45.800 --> 07:49.760
You know, I think I remember
one of them telling me
they loved that.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.316
Now which one was it?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.591
I just wonder which one
of the Tates did it.

07:54.800 --> 07:58.476
Burt, I find it very difficult to believe
that one of the Tates is a murderer.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.831
Oh, you do, do you, huh?
Well... Well, I don't.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.997
It was one of them. I know it.

08:03.200 --> 08:04.395
Probably Jessica.

08:04.600 --> 08:06.034
She couldn't have, Burt.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.640
Not in a million years.

08:07.840 --> 08:09.320
Mary, please,
do you ever talk to that woman?

08:09.520 --> 08:12.240
She's got a vacuum cleaner bag
up here.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.399
You know, Jessica told me
she talks to flowers.

08:15.600 --> 08:18.320
Lots of people do that.
I talk to my fern.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.512
Yeah, but does it answer?
What?

08:20.720 --> 08:22.154
Does it answer?
Of course not.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.990
Okay. Jessica's flowers answer.
I mean, they... They talk back.

08:26.200 --> 08:27.919
You've heard them?
BURT: No, I...

08:28.120 --> 08:29.952
No, of course not. She told me.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.594
Now, you don't think that's crazy?

08:31.800 --> 08:36.477
A woman who says her flowers talk?
Jessica.

08:36.679 --> 08:41.072
It was Burt. It was Burt
who said he loved <i>The Exorcist.</i>

08:41.280 --> 08:46.435
Uh, either that
or <i>The Sound of Music.</i> Uh...
He was raving about one of them.

08:46.640 --> 08:49.872
Chester, do... Do you think
it could have been Burt?

08:50.080 --> 08:52.231
Jessica, you know
I can't stand the man.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.557
I'd be happy to pin anything on him.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.514
But I have trouble believing
he'd kill his own son.

08:57.720 --> 09:00.360
Maybe it was Danny.
Why Danny?

09:00.560 --> 09:02.552
He's so rude.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.797
Oh, I don't think
it could've been Danny.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.631
Y-you remember the time
that the trees got all infested
with those awful birds,

09:09.840 --> 09:12.036
what are their names? Uh...
Grackles.

09:12.240 --> 09:15.039
Right, the crapples.
Well... Would you...

09:15.240 --> 09:17.118
Grackles.
Right, yeah.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.312
Well, everybody wanted
to shoot the birds,

09:19.520 --> 09:22.831
and don't you remember,
Danny passed around the petition
and saved the birds.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.952
So I don't think
it could've been Danny.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.674
Maybe it was Jodie.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.076
Jodie? Please, the man
couldn't even kill himself.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.509
[LAUGHS]

09:31.040 --> 09:32.759
I think it was Chester.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.759
Come on. Chester would be afraid
of staining his clothes.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.599
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I think Bob's right.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.075
Yeah, sure. That's it.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.000
Chester, right? Chester did it.
Chester, that's it. Uh-huh.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.672
Maybe it was Jodie.
You know how jealous he gets. Hah.

09:46.880 --> 09:51.432
God knows, Peter was having an affair
with enough members of this family.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.791
I'm glad you said it.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.234
I think it was Corinne.
Ha. No way.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.840
What, no way? She had a motive.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.872
She was living with him.
She was jealous.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.958
Corinne did it. Corinne's the one.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.710
Well, if it wasn't any one of
the Campbells, then it was one of us.

10:06.920 --> 10:07.920
Please, Corinne.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.915
She is right. The chief of police said
that it was someone in either family,

10:12.120 --> 10:13.520
and we are all suspects.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.120
We are not.
Yes, we are.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.915
You are a suspect.
I am a suspect.

10:18.120 --> 10:21.670
So is Corinne. A-and...
And so is Eunice. So is Benson.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.155
I mean, it's amazing.

10:23.360 --> 10:27.639
Here we are, all five perfectly
nice people, enjoying breakfast...

10:27.840 --> 10:30.878
Well, actually, four because
Benson's not eating.

10:31.080 --> 10:34.073
But I mean, Chester, here we are,
five perfectly nice people,

10:34.280 --> 10:37.876
and out of these five perfectly nice
people one of us is probably a killer.

10:38.080 --> 10:42.757
I mean, a ruthless, cold-blooded,
dangerous, homicidal,
lunatic, maniac killer

10:42.960 --> 10:45.794
who, naturally, is very cleverly
disguised as a nice person.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.560
Jessica, please. Enough of this.

10:48.760 --> 10:51.480
For the last time, no one killed...

10:58.760 --> 10:59.955
It's like magic.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.958
I walk in and talking stops.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.994
Well, don't worry, I'm not staying.
I'm late for school.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.157
I'll just grab my juice
and be on my way.

11:07.360 --> 11:10.637
Dad, the last word in your sentence
was "killed."

11:12.880 --> 11:14.439
Go.
