WEBVTT

00:22.230 --> 00:24.024
Do you know how much easier it would be

00:24.107 --> 00:26.484
if we could just squeeze
her pretty little neck

00:26.568 --> 00:28.486
until she agreed to make our key?

00:28.570 --> 00:29.571
No!

00:30.196 --> 00:32.282
-We're doing things my way.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.035
Okay, now is not the time to go soft.

00:36.244 --> 00:39.497
Look, she keeps her music box
on her dresser.

00:39.581 --> 00:43.084
-Mm-hmm.
-Once I get it, she'll do anything I say.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.796
Okay, and what am I supposed to do? Hmm?

00:48.089 --> 00:49.299
What you're best at.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.301
Absolutely nothing.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.794
Hey, Dunc, it's, uh… it's freezing out.
Thought you could use a coffee.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.546
Yeah, thanks.
You can leave it on the table over there.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.759
Are you, uh…

01:34.135 --> 01:36.679
are you taking Gracie apart
or putting her back together?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.681
A little of both.
The transmission's slipping.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.809
I'm trying to avoid a full rebuild.

01:40.892 --> 01:43.812
Working on the valve body,
then I'm gonna put in a new shift kit.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.022
Oh, is that all?

01:46.106 --> 01:49.567
Well, no. Then I have to put in
new fuel lines, new brake line,

01:49.651 --> 01:51.569
and she needs a new starter as well.

01:53.738 --> 01:54.906
I could help out.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.034
No, I'm… I'm good. Thank you though.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.456
Sure you don't want to come in for lunch?
You've been going all morning.

02:04.165 --> 02:08.461
I'm sorry, but I'm really just trying
to stay focused on this right now, okay?

02:09.671 --> 02:10.839
Okay, yeah.

02:12.882 --> 02:14.300
-Good luck.
-Uh-huh.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.932
Duncan still at it?

02:21.015 --> 02:23.309
Yeah. He's…
He's in the zone, I guess.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.896
Ah. I had no idea he was so into that car.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.947
You're quiet this morning.

02:36.948 --> 02:38.449
Something on your mind, bud?

02:39.033 --> 02:39.993
Nope.

02:40.994 --> 02:41.911
Hey!

02:43.121 --> 02:45.540
Um, so I'm having dinner
with a friend tonight.

02:45.623 --> 02:49.419
Uh, I'll give you guys some money
for pizza unless Duncan wants to cook.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.753
I wouldn't count on it.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.465
Hey, look what you got.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.574
Hey, Gabe.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.035
Hey, buddy.

03:23.494 --> 03:24.621
What you got there?

03:25.246 --> 03:26.706
A letter from Rufus.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.291
He lives in Nebraska now.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.043
He's got a bunch of new friends,

03:30.126 --> 03:32.837
and his uncle just fixed up
an old tree house for him.

03:33.546 --> 03:34.464
That's nice.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.674
You wanna play around
with the Hercules Key?

03:36.758 --> 03:39.093
Next time, bud. Is your sister around?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.554
She's in her room. You can go on up.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.847
Thanks.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.888
What are you doing here?

04:24.389 --> 04:28.434
Hey. I'm sorry.
Bode told me I could just come up.

04:36.359 --> 04:39.737
Which I… I see now was a bad idea.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.117
What's wrong?

04:44.742 --> 04:46.786
Last night at Mr. Bennett's party,

04:47.787 --> 04:49.706
I walked in on something
between you and Eden,

04:49.789 --> 04:51.291
like you had some kind of secret.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.668
No, it's not what you think it was.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.379
Tell me what's going on.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.505
All right.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.217
Okay, look. Eden's embarrassed,
and she doesn't want anyone to know,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.679
which is why all the secrecy,
but she asked me to tutor her in trig.

05:04.762 --> 05:06.681
Come on.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.809
What? Kinsey, it's true!

05:09.892 --> 05:13.146
I'm telling you. She's failing.
She might get kicked out of school.

05:13.771 --> 05:17.108
You know, so I agreed to help her.
She's desperate.

05:17.191 --> 05:18.609
So why didn't you tell me?

05:19.944 --> 05:21.237
I…

05:22.572 --> 05:24.490
Look, she… she made me swear not to.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.076
Look.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.995
Kinsey, she's not a bad person.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.499
Seriously, her parents
dumped her at boarding school

05:33.583 --> 05:35.293
so they could go travel and party.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.922
I felt sorry for her.

05:41.174 --> 05:46.179
But I… I know my loyalty
should have been to you, not with Eden.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.807
I'm sorry. I… I should have told you.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.269
It's fine.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.148
It was just confusing.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.237
Hey.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.156
Uh, I'm heading out.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.866
Going to Javi's party?

06:07.575 --> 06:09.035
No. School, actually.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.079
On a Saturday?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.039
Uh…

06:15.917 --> 06:18.294
Oh, that's, uh… No, that's cool. I get it.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.005
You don't have to tell me anything.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.263
It's my uncle.

06:30.014 --> 06:31.891
We put his memories back in his head.

06:33.309 --> 06:34.310
Wow.

06:34.394 --> 06:39.190
But now how he keeps having these,
like, flashes of magic,

06:39.273 --> 06:42.819
but they don't… they don't make
any sense to him because he's an adult.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.904
He's all screwed up.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.198
Shit. What are you gonna do?

06:49.367 --> 06:54.664
Duncan made this key when he was a kid
that allows adults to remember magic,

06:54.747 --> 06:57.750
but… but our dad hid it
at the academy somewhere.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.045
Uh…

07:01.629 --> 07:03.923
Duncan can make keys?

07:04.632 --> 07:05.842
Apparently.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.471
Well, I'll, um… I'll come help you search.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.474
Uh, no, it's okay. I can… I can manage.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.268
No, it's a big campus.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.353
You'll need the extra eyes.

07:17.854 --> 07:18.938
Uh…

07:19.814 --> 07:22.191
All right.
Yeah, actually, that would help.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.276
Thank you.

07:23.985 --> 07:26.529
I'll stay and look after Duncan.
Text me updates.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.072
I will.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.995
-Good luck.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.422
Are you sure my dad hid the key
somewhere at the academy?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.966
Yeah, it's where we saw him take it,
in my memory.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.469
What if Tyler can't find it?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.012
Tyler's gonna find it.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.603
Maybe you should go find a friend
to hang out with or something.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.647
It'll help you chill out.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.571
Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.240
Bode?

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
Tyler, I need to borrow the Anywhere Key.

08:14.577 --> 08:17.580
-It's not the time to screw around, Bode.
-I wanna visit Rufus.

08:18.456 --> 08:21.083
You're just gonna go
to Nebraska by yourself?

08:21.167 --> 08:23.211
Please, just for a few hours.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.004
Come on. I'll be fine.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.178
All right, just be careful.
Don't freak anyone out.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.014
Actually, while we're trading keys,
give me the, um…

08:35.097 --> 08:36.349
give me the Hercules Key.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.725
Deal.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.398
Thanks. Bye!

08:46.734 --> 08:50.071
We could have used the Anywhere Key
for our search around the academy.

08:50.154 --> 08:51.322
It's fine. I…

08:51.906 --> 08:55.284
I got a guy on the inside. Just have to
get there the old-fashioned way.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.532
Whoa.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.593
-Rufus!
-Bode!

09:56.846 --> 10:00.558
-I can't believe you're really here.
-I finally got the Anywhere Key back.

10:00.641 --> 10:01.726
You got the photo?

10:01.809 --> 10:04.312
Yeah. By the way, I love your room.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.188
-Thank you, soldier.
-Roger that.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.858
Here, I brought you something.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.530
What?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.200
That's amazing.

10:20.036 --> 10:22.330
And also kinda gross.

10:23.164 --> 10:24.457
Where did you get this?

10:24.540 --> 10:27.710
We have a lot
of catching up to do.

10:44.810 --> 10:49.190
Hey, you know, I was just thinking about
how crazy it is that Duncan can make keys.

10:49.273 --> 10:52.193
I figured if anyone in your family
could do it back in the day,

10:52.276 --> 10:53.653
it would be your dad.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.237
Erin said that he tried,

10:55.321 --> 10:57.740
but Duncan was the only one
who could do it.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.867
Yeah, but…

10:59.950 --> 11:02.203
But… But why? What makes him so special?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.748
Erin thought maybe
it was because he was so innocent.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.750
We don't really know.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.086
-Evenin', fellas.
-Hey, Logan.

11:11.545 --> 11:12.963
This is your guy on the inside?

11:13.047 --> 11:15.925
Yeah, you think the Lockes
are the only ones with magical keys?

11:16.008 --> 11:18.678
-Behold.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.513
What is that?

11:20.596 --> 11:23.933
Freshman year, I talked Bernadette
into giving me a copy of the master key

11:24.016 --> 11:25.768
so I can get around campus easier.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.689
Don't question it, baby.
Just reap the benefits, all right?

11:35.111 --> 11:36.862
Okay, so where do we start?

11:36.946 --> 11:39.949
In the memory,
I saw the trophy case.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.171
Well, shit,
I don't have a key for that.

12:00.428 --> 12:01.846
Oh, it's broken.

12:03.347 --> 12:05.474
I guess security
is pretty lax around here.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.443
Well, your dad was quite the athlete.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.403
Did he run in college too?

12:18.112 --> 12:20.406
No, not after what happened
with his friends.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.201
Man, that's just tragic.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.668
Hearing any whispering?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.756
No, I don't think it's in here.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.553
Okay, where to next?

12:45.848 --> 12:47.475
Your dad did theater, right?

12:49.810 --> 12:51.103
Let's check it out.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.194
-Oh, hey.
-You're finally taking a break.

12:58.277 --> 12:59.779
Yeah, just getting some water.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.240
You want something to eat?

13:03.324 --> 13:04.575
-No, I'm fine.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.245
Mom left us money for pizza.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.624
-Or I can fix you something.

13:12.333 --> 13:13.459
I said I'm good.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.050
I'm good, okay?

13:23.302 --> 13:24.136
Okay.

13:44.573 --> 13:45.491
Hey.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.785
Anything from Tyler?

13:48.619 --> 13:49.495
Not yet.

13:58.462 --> 13:59.922
Everything okay?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.550
There's just this party.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.219
Well, it's not even about the party.

14:05.302 --> 14:08.389
There's someone at the party
that I said something shitty to.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.852
I wanna apologize,
but now I've gotta look after Duncan, so…

14:12.935 --> 14:15.938
No, go! I'll keep an eye on him.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.066
-You sure?
-Yeah.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.111
You don't wanna be left
regretting all the things you didn't say.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.280
Trust me.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.577
Okay. Thanks. I won't be long.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.377
It smells amazing.

14:40.337 --> 14:41.255
Can I do anything?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.341
Nope, everything is under control.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.603
-Mmm, mmm.
-Yeah, I see that.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.773
-Hmm.

14:59.857 --> 15:05.112
Did you know
that, uh, arrabbiata is Italian for angry?

15:05.863 --> 15:10.910
You… You do look very angry
in your apron with the frills.

15:10.993 --> 15:12.453
Hey, this came with the place.

15:12.536 --> 15:17.207
Miss Garcia, the biology teacher,
she lived here last year.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.711
Ah-ha. Okay, sure.
Yeah, blame it on Miss Garcia.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.756
Okay, I admit I did put it on
of my own volition.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.384
So where's Jamie tonight?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.637
She is living her best life.

15:29.720 --> 15:34.224
Go-karts and ice cream, arcade games.

15:34.308 --> 15:36.644
-My mother is… Ooh.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.980
…oddly good at arcade games,

15:40.064 --> 15:42.900
which is why I don't play arcade games.

15:42.983 --> 15:43.859
Fair enough.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.653
But I can cook,

15:46.487 --> 15:49.865
which you'll soon find out.

15:51.742 --> 15:53.285
I can't wait.

15:55.037 --> 15:58.290
-The thing about cooking is it requires…

15:58.374 --> 15:59.375
…attention.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.047
And you're very distracting.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.384
You wanna, uh,

16:09.343 --> 16:10.594
try this?

16:16.684 --> 16:17.685
Mmm.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.103
Oh!

16:21.271 --> 16:22.106
That's good.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.400
Does it need anything?

16:27.736 --> 16:28.654
Nothing.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.457
Excuse me.

16:47.339 --> 16:51.051
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Bennett.
I wanted to return your Gettysburg book.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.512
-Okay, thanks, Kenna.
-You were right.

16:53.595 --> 16:56.265
The chapter on Pickett's Charge
was incredible.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.434
-I can't believe how detailed--
-It was great.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.644
I'm glad you liked it.
I'll see you Monday.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.448
-Hey.

18:54.716 --> 18:55.634
Find something?

18:56.635 --> 18:58.679
Uh, yeah, check this out.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.350
Who's that?

19:03.892 --> 19:06.103
It's my dad and all his friends.

19:06.186 --> 19:10.232
Oh, and Mr. Ridgeway!
Gotta say, he was kind of a stud.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.360
They look so normal, happy.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.070
Yeah, they were.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.031
They… Yeah, they look like they were.

19:19.116 --> 19:21.660
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made on."

19:25.330 --> 19:27.624
Yo, I know that quote.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.088
I know where that quote is.

19:38.010 --> 19:42.222
-Huh. I've never noticed that before.
-That's why I'm the guy on the inside.

19:43.056 --> 19:43.974
Huh.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.895
"Donated by the Locke family

19:47.978 --> 19:51.773
in loving memory of Kim Toffer,
Jeff Ellis, and Lucas Caravaggio."

19:53.817 --> 19:55.611
My family donated this?

19:56.195 --> 19:57.404
That's dope.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.702
I can hear it.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.004
It's coming from under the bench.

20:15.505 --> 20:18.133
You've never heard it before
when you walked by?

20:18.217 --> 20:21.094
I think the keys only whisper
when we need them the most.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.682
How are we gonna get underneath?
It's solid cement.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.102
This ought to do the trick.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.246
Okay.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.590
Oh shit, man! That works!

21:07.432 --> 21:09.268
-Oh, there it is.
-Yeah, I'll get it.

21:09.351 --> 21:10.644
It's okay. I got it.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.150
This is it.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.861
The Memory Key.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.878
Yeah, that's amazing. We should go back
to Keyhouse and try it out.

21:36.962 --> 21:40.882
We should probably do this on our own.
Duncan's kind of in a fragile place.

21:40.966 --> 21:44.553
-Uh, yeah, I mean--
-Yeah, totally get it, man. Good luck.

21:45.053 --> 21:47.514
-Thank you, guys, both of you.
-Yeah.

21:48.432 --> 21:50.684
-Appreciate it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um…

21:51.518 --> 21:53.228
Hey, look.

21:53.312 --> 21:57.024
You know, I was just thinking it might
be good to have somebody else there.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.276
I mean, you don't know
what's gonna happen.

21:59.359 --> 22:02.237
Kinsey'll be there.
She'll text, let you know how it goes.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.905
-Are you--
-Thanks again!

22:05.240 --> 22:06.199
Yeah.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.925
by Joel Corry playing]

22:28.555 --> 22:33.310
Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

22:33.393 --> 22:34.436
Throw it in!

22:35.020 --> 22:36.605
-Oh!

22:42.569 --> 22:44.279
Yo! Kinsey Locke!

22:44.363 --> 22:45.530
Whoo!

23:05.342 --> 23:07.969
-Hey! Now it's a party! You made it!
-Hey.

23:08.053 --> 23:08.970
Yeah.

23:12.849 --> 23:15.268
I'll get us a round. Hmm?

23:19.439 --> 23:21.233
I heard about Rochester.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.567
I'm sorry.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.363
And I'm also sorry for what I said.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.867
Probably for the best.
Would've made a fool of myself there, so…

23:30.951 --> 23:32.994
That's not true. It's their loss.

23:35.914 --> 23:36.832
Gabe here?

23:38.792 --> 23:43.171
No. But you were right
about him and Eden, sorta.

23:44.923 --> 23:49.219
I straight-up asked him what's up,
and he's been tutoring her on the sly.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.596
And that's what he told you, huh?

23:52.222 --> 23:53.348
You don't believe him?

23:54.182 --> 23:55.851
It doesn't matter what I believe.

23:58.228 --> 24:01.440
I'm gonna go grab some food.
Do you want anything?

24:02.149 --> 24:03.191
I'm good.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.526
I'll catch you later.

24:13.118 --> 24:14.035
Hey, Kinsey.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.080
Hey, I didn't realize
this was your birthday party.

24:17.164 --> 24:19.124
Yeah, you and me both.

24:19.207 --> 24:22.002
Javi will use any excuse to throw a rager.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.795
It's all making sense now.

24:23.879 --> 24:28.091
Yeah, last year, he celebrated Flag Day
with a red, white, and blue foam party.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.138
What's going on in there?

24:33.221 --> 24:34.347
I don't know.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.483
What's up, man? Come on!

24:44.566 --> 24:45.525
Come on.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.992
Come on, Eden! Go!

24:54.075 --> 24:55.619
Eden, you got this!

25:07.047 --> 25:10.008
-Holy shit, bro. Eden just served you.

25:10.091 --> 25:13.136
She's… She's juicing. Gotta be.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.638
What is wrong with you?

25:18.266 --> 25:21.937
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

25:22.020 --> 25:26.233
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

25:27.275 --> 25:29.402
-Oh!

25:30.737 --> 25:33.406
-Eden's in rare form.
-What's going on with her?

25:33.490 --> 25:36.368
I don't know.
She's been super weird lately.

25:36.451 --> 25:38.328
We don't really talk much anymore.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.581
Honestly, it was always kind of
a one-sided friendship.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.379
Well, well, look who's here!

25:47.462 --> 25:50.590
Kinsey Locke. Where's Gabe?

25:50.674 --> 25:51.967
He's out with Tyler.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.803
Oh. Well, I am so glad that you're here.

25:59.516 --> 26:01.518
Hey, don't you think you've had enough?

26:01.601 --> 26:03.144
Piss off, Jackie.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.397
Hey, she's just looking out for you.

26:06.231 --> 26:09.276
I'm not dealing with this tonight.
See you later.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.153
What a killjoy!

26:12.654 --> 26:14.364
At her own party!

26:15.907 --> 26:17.158
This is great.

26:17.742 --> 26:21.037
You and I can hang out
and spend some quality time together.

26:24.624 --> 26:26.835
Gabe said you guys have been hanging out.

26:28.295 --> 26:30.297
Yeah, tutoring.

26:30.380 --> 26:35.927
I've never been good at the whole
"no hablo español" thing, so, yeah.

26:38.471 --> 26:40.807
He said he was tutoring you in trig.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.185
Yeah, that too.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.605
I suck at both.

26:48.815 --> 26:52.902
Whatever. Do you wanna go and find
somewhere quieter for us to hang?

26:55.322 --> 26:58.533
Yeah. I'm trying to find a bathroom.
I'll be right back.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.172
Scot?

27:13.965 --> 27:15.800
-What's up?
-I need your help.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.511
Look, I know things are weird
with us right now,

27:18.595 --> 27:21.306
but I have to find out
if what Gabe told me is true.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.933
How am I supposed to help with that?

27:24.017 --> 27:26.645
I wanna have a chat with Eden.
I think she's lying.

27:27.228 --> 27:30.231
Can you just stand outside the door
and make sure no one comes in?

27:33.485 --> 27:34.444
Please.

27:35.362 --> 27:37.489
I think something weird is going on.

27:39.741 --> 27:40.659
Okay.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.119
Sure, let's do it.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.330
Thanks.

27:55.131 --> 27:58.593
Hey, Jamie's been teaching me
how to play chess,

27:58.677 --> 28:01.805
and I've been teaching her
how to duel with a lightsaber.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.682
And she knows about the keys?

28:03.765 --> 28:06.726
We can trust her. She's one of us.

28:07.227 --> 28:10.480
She sounds cool.
Maybe next time you could bring her.

28:10.563 --> 28:12.774
Yeah, she'd love this place.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.361
It's even cooler in person.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.031
I like to come here and draw.
I'll show you what I'm working on.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.533
Sure.

28:24.828 --> 28:26.788
It's called Squadron Strange.

28:29.833 --> 28:34.254
Wow, this is really, really cool.

28:34.796 --> 28:37.173
The Squadron hunts down
evil, supernatural forces

28:37.257 --> 28:38.883
in order to protect humanity.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.510
They're led by Sergeant E.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.513
She's a badass fighter
who takes no prisoners

28:44.639 --> 28:47.392
and makes the best
grilled cheese sandwich in the world.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.603
Hey, that's your mom!

28:51.855 --> 28:53.440
She looks very brave.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.609
She's the bravest person I know.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.195
She's out there somewhere.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.197
I know it.

29:02.949 --> 29:04.325
I'm going to see her again.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.871
I believe that too.

29:15.336 --> 29:18.423
Hey, uh, what's this?

29:24.512 --> 29:26.389
I've been talking to a therapist.

29:27.223 --> 29:30.435
He's helping me work out what happened
the night my mom disappeared.

29:44.616 --> 29:48.453
I remember there were two Dodges
standing in the living room.

29:52.081 --> 29:53.416
And then I passed out.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.878
I don't remember what happened after.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.924
Two Dodges?

30:01.716 --> 30:03.218
I don't know what it means.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.180
Tell me everything
that you remember.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.644
-Cold spaghetti on the couch.
-Mmm!

30:13.478 --> 30:17.315
It's the stuff that
Harlequin romance novels are made of.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.983
They really ought to be.

30:20.985 --> 30:22.153
Maybe next time

30:23.530 --> 30:25.073
I'll make dinner at my house.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.159
-Oh, the famous Keyhouse.
-Mmm.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.746
I didn't think I would get an invite
after you saw my creepy dollhouse.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.914
It was iffy.

30:34.123 --> 30:35.667
Oh, I almost forgot.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.170
I brought you a gift.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.468
I found it in the Winter Study.

30:46.052 --> 30:50.849
It's a ledger from the 1700s
that one of the Lockes kept for the house.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.309
Oh.

30:55.311 --> 30:57.397
Did you know Keyhouse
was an intelligence base

30:57.480 --> 30:59.107
during the Revolutionary War?

30:59.190 --> 31:01.734
I knew that the house had
historical significance,

31:01.818 --> 31:05.530
but I never realized
the Lockes were so wrapped up in the war.

31:05.613 --> 31:08.575
This documents the daily activities
in and around the house.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.118
The comings and goings,

31:11.119 --> 31:13.913
how much artillery
the Revolutionaries had left,

31:13.997 --> 31:15.748
soldiers lost.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.126
This is amazing.

31:18.626 --> 31:21.462
Would you like
some time alone with it?

31:21.546 --> 31:23.756
-Yes. Thank you.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.763
I'd rather have some time alone with you.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.390
You sure?

31:33.224 --> 31:35.351
You seem to really like that ledger.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.661
Let's take a break from the craziness
and hang out in here.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.288
That's a really good idea.

32:15.141 --> 32:16.184
Ooh.

32:16.267 --> 32:18.645
God, she used to love that stupid song.

32:19.437 --> 32:20.605
She who?

32:20.688 --> 32:23.483
Have you seen
your Fear Monster lately?

32:23.566 --> 32:25.401
The bitch kept coming for me.

32:25.485 --> 32:28.529
Sorry, but don't worry.
It won't happen again.

32:28.613 --> 32:33.242
You know, Gabe's always trying
to keep you all to himself.

32:34.869 --> 32:37.080
-Really? I don't think he does that.
-Mmm.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.706
I'm done listening to him.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.750
It's my time now.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.880
I love your necklace.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.433
Oh.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.728
Mmm.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.771
God.

33:02.981 --> 33:07.443
Don't go anywhere
because I'm gonna kill you when I wake up.

33:20.081 --> 33:20.957
Eden?

35:28.793 --> 35:31.629
Eden, I told you not to eat
that last piece of birthday cake.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.965
But vanilla chocolate swirl
is my favorite.

35:35.925 --> 35:39.929
A minute on the lips,
a lifetime on the hips.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.649
Whoa! Oh!

35:52.191 --> 35:54.360
Hey. Where are you off to?

35:54.443 --> 35:56.237
I left my coat inside.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.699
-You leaving your own birthday party?
-It's not my party.

36:00.199 --> 36:04.287
Okay. Well, I don't think it's a great
idea to be going in there right now.

36:04.370 --> 36:08.374
Kinsey's babysitting Eden.
Eden's off her trolley!

36:09.667 --> 36:12.920
So why don't I just slip in
and get it for you?

36:13.504 --> 36:16.549
Thanks.
It's the maroon wool coat.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.800
Maroon wool coat.

36:17.884 --> 36:20.553
-Kins, I'm coming in for a minute.

36:21.846 --> 36:22.847
Just a sec.

36:30.646 --> 36:31.939
Oh shit!

36:37.236 --> 36:38.279
Of course it is.

37:00.927 --> 37:01.761
There you go.

37:02.762 --> 37:04.680
Um, is Eden okay in there?

37:04.764 --> 37:06.807
Yeah. Yeah. No, she's… she's fine.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.518
-Maybe I should--
-No, no, no. Kinsey's got it.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.230
Happy birthday, Jackie!

37:12.313 --> 37:15.066
Hey! Jackie! Jackie!

37:15.149 --> 37:19.654
Jackie!
Jackie! Jackie! Jackie! Jackie!

37:21.030 --> 37:24.408
I gotta get the hell out of here.
Good luck with Project Eden.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.535
-Thanks, I'll need it.
-Mmm.

37:40.049 --> 37:41.133
Oh man.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.563
No, no, no, no, no.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.461
No!

38:23.426 --> 38:24.593
Close the door!

38:29.849 --> 38:32.768
-Holy shit!
-What are you doing in here?

38:32.852 --> 38:35.980
Eden said she wanted to kill me.
Now I know why.

38:36.063 --> 38:37.315
Look at this.

38:37.857 --> 38:38.941
Oh, it smells rank.

38:39.025 --> 38:39.984
Just watch.

38:40.568 --> 38:41.944
When we opened the Black Door,

38:42.028 --> 38:44.071
and those things
shot out from the other side,

38:44.572 --> 38:46.073
one of them hit Eden.

38:46.157 --> 38:49.160
-Well, that means all summer, she's--
-She's a demon.

38:49.243 --> 38:52.455
Look at this place. It's like a cancer
spreading inside her head.

38:53.205 --> 38:55.875
Yeah, but I mean, are we…
are we quite sure that

38:55.958 --> 38:58.461
Eden's brain wasn't
a wasteland before?

39:00.838 --> 39:02.506
Look, we need to get out of here.

39:02.590 --> 39:05.259
Let's look through a few more.
Maybe we can figure out what she wants.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.554
Hurry, because we are in a demon's head
without her knowledge or permission.

39:20.149 --> 39:23.652
-Back! Get back! Back! Get back!

39:23.736 --> 39:25.738
Holy shit. This is insane.

39:29.283 --> 39:31.118
Scot, are you finding anything?

39:34.914 --> 39:35.790
Scot?

39:37.416 --> 39:38.501
Kins, I…

39:39.960 --> 39:40.920
What is it?

39:43.464 --> 39:44.382
Didn't work.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.467
You wanna know why?

39:46.550 --> 39:48.427
I'm sure you're gonna tell me.

39:57.228 --> 39:58.813
This can't be right.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.606
How else do you explain all of this?

40:00.689 --> 40:03.401
We got rid of Dodge. Gabe can't be Dodge.

40:05.486 --> 40:08.072
-You were there. This can't be real.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.170
Let's go.

40:27.299 --> 40:29.009
Oh shit! We have to go now!

40:29.844 --> 40:30.719
Go!

40:31.470 --> 40:32.888
-Kinsey!

40:36.767 --> 40:38.394
Get off me!

40:45.943 --> 40:47.153
Kinsey!

40:54.618 --> 40:55.453
Go!

40:57.204 --> 40:58.038
Scot!

40:58.122 --> 40:59.498
-Go, go, go, go!
-Scot!

41:09.049 --> 41:10.468
Oh, no, no, you go first!

41:15.139 --> 41:16.432
Get off me!

41:19.310 --> 41:21.604
-Aah!
-Scot! Here, the key!

41:26.942 --> 41:27.776
Go!

41:35.534 --> 41:36.410
Go!

41:46.962 --> 41:49.924
Stupid question, but you okay?

41:51.717 --> 41:52.718
Oh my God.

41:54.428 --> 41:56.722
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

41:58.849 --> 42:01.936
We're gonna figure this out.
I promise. I promise.

42:19.036 --> 42:20.663
Oh, hey, look, look!

42:22.331 --> 42:24.166
Eden, where the hell are you?

42:25.000 --> 42:27.586
Look, I'm on my way to Keyhouse
with or without you.

42:32.049 --> 42:35.302
Shit. I have to go.
Can you stay and watch over Eden?

42:35.386 --> 42:37.596
Make sure when she wakes up
she doesn't remember anything!

42:37.680 --> 42:39.306
-What if she does?

42:43.686 --> 42:44.562
Bye.

42:45.312 --> 42:48.190
I miss you already,
but luckily I have this ledger now.

42:48.274 --> 42:49.858
Funny.

44:00.763 --> 44:01.764
Duncan?

44:01.847 --> 44:05.100
Hey, uh, can you come inside for a minute?

44:05.184 --> 44:07.227
I'm trying to reattach this fan.

44:07.728 --> 44:10.773
Please, just… just for a minute.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.237
What are we doing up here?

44:20.574 --> 44:22.368
What is she doing here?

44:22.993 --> 44:25.454
I don't know what's going on,
but this is giving me a headache.

44:25.537 --> 44:27.623
Giving me a really big headache.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.875
I wanna help you.

44:30.834 --> 44:31.877
We both do.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.214
Help me how?

44:52.356 --> 44:53.482
Oh my head.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.111
Sit down.

45:06.954 --> 45:08.414
I can make it better.

45:13.377 --> 45:15.462
What's happening? What are you doing?

45:16.255 --> 45:17.256
Just trust me.

45:32.312 --> 45:33.313
Shit.

45:33.397 --> 45:34.314
It's okay.

45:35.524 --> 45:36.358
Duncan?

46:05.846 --> 46:07.306
Do you remember making this?

46:10.601 --> 46:11.435
Yeah.

46:13.979 --> 46:15.189
Do you know where you are?

46:18.525 --> 46:19.526
I'm home.

46:31.914 --> 46:34.333
Oh my God. Oh.

46:34.958 --> 46:36.960
-Duncan?

46:38.670 --> 46:39.755
Did it work?

46:41.173 --> 46:42.049
Yeah.

46:42.549 --> 46:46.678
I just got so much
just rushing through my head right now.

46:52.851 --> 46:53.685
Where's Gabe?

46:54.603 --> 46:57.356
Uh, I… I left him at school. Why?

47:03.028 --> 47:04.154
Kinsey, what's wrong?

47:07.574 --> 47:09.159
I went into Eden's head.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.745
What? Why?

47:12.246 --> 47:16.500
I thought something was wrong,
but it's worse. So much worse.

47:18.961 --> 47:19.795
What do you mean?

47:20.921 --> 47:22.589
Gabe is Dodge,

47:23.423 --> 47:24.758
and Eden's a demon.

47:26.885 --> 47:29.429
-That's not possible.
-I saw it in Eden's memories.

47:29.513 --> 47:32.266
-We threw Dodge into the Black Door.
-It wasn't Dodge!

47:34.393 --> 47:35.644
Well, then who was it?

47:48.240 --> 47:49.199
Hey, Kinsey.
