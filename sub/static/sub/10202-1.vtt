anxiously awaiting the information

13:52.332 --> 13:54.082
that we found these weapons.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.668
We have a detailed media plan
we've worked out.

We've coordinated
with the public-affairs folks.

all aspects of the good news.

I had a couple questions

14:10.266 --> 14:12.226

for tomorrow.

this is accurate?

a human-source intel.

But it's solid.
It's current as of 0400.

we've been using?

Give me a list of the places
where you went, and the grids,

14:38.419 --> 14:40.504
and we'll make sure that you had
the right information written down

14:40.588 --> 14:41.630
and that you went to
the right places, okay?

14:41.714 --> 14:45.342
Captain, the issue isn't the grids, sir.
The issue's that there's nothing there.

Stand down, Chief.
We need to move on here.

hear what the chief has to say.

it was a toilet factory.

I'm saying
there's a disconnect

15:04.028 --> 15:08.198
between what's in these packets
and what we're seeing on the ground.

You sure it was him?
Positive.

did they take him?

around Baghdad, mostly Adhamiya.

It's a Sunni stronghold,
very sympathetic to the army.

More than likely,
that's where Al Rawi is.

line to his battalion commanders.

about if you just got invaded?

wants to fight?

an offer, he will.
