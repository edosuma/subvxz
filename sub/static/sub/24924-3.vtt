00:42.200 --> 00:44.156
[Clay] I'm still waiting for Hannah Baker.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.160
[man] Who?

00:45.250 --> 00:47.571
[Clay]
Slqe Miller. I'm here for Skye Miller.

00:50.590 --> 00:53.969
She's still in recovery.
They'll move her up here in a few hours.

00:54.670 --> 00:57.889
That's what the other nurse said
every hour for the past seven hours.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.677
Kid, go home. Come back in the morning.

01:00.970 --> 01:03.473
Will she be okay?
Look, I just need to know.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.881
Go home. Come back.

01:05.980 --> 01:08.221
Cause you're always there
All the time

01:08.310 --> 01:12.064
On every face I meet
On every road I drive

01:12.150 --> 01:13.981
You're not my savior

01:14.070 --> 01:18.234
Just someone I used to see

01:18.320 --> 01:23.997
I am broken
Something's wrong inside of me

01:24.080 --> 01:26.241
I feel violent

01:26.330 --> 01:27.820
[Clay] I'm still waiting for Hannah Baker.

01:27.920 --> 01:29.740
-[echoing] Hannah Baker...
- Like I'm dying

01:29.920 --> 01:35.415
I feel broken
Maybe I'm just breaking free

02:08.540 --> 02:12.169
Clay, it's five o'clock in the morning.
What the hell is going on?

02:12.460 --> 02:15.588
Slqe is my girlfriend.
But we haven't had sex, although we tried.

02:15.670 --> 02:18.673
She's in the hospital right now,
but not because she tried to kill herself.

02:19.090 --> 02:21.888
Someone just ran me off the road
on my way home.

02:21.970 --> 02:24.211
Random? Maybe. Who knows?

02:24.310 --> 02:27.473
I can't explain any of it to you
because I don't understand it myself.

02:27.890 --> 02:30.393
Now, does knowing all this
make this any better or worse for you?

02:30.850 --> 02:33.512
Our agreement was
that we'd talk about these things.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.066
When the house is on fire,

02:35.150 --> 02:37.983
do you discuss the fire
or get out of the goddamn house?

02:39.950 --> 02:40.769
Oh.

02:42.950 --> 02:44.406
I need a fucking car.

02:50.080 --> 02:51.786
[Jessica]
I don't blame Hannah for anything.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.240
That's how it is for girls.

02:56.920 --> 03:01.209
People judge you by the way you look,
the things they hear about you.

03:05.510 --> 03:06.966
They put a label on you.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.313
I just feel like boys
get to define themselves.

03:23.700 --> 03:27.238
They get to choose their identity,
and they can hide behind it.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.200
Well, most boys.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.741
I think some know what it's like
to be afraid...

03:40.170 --> 03:43.082
to feel like the world gave you
a certain label

03:43.180 --> 03:45.546
that you have to live with
for the rest of your life.

03:46.430 --> 03:50.924
But most boys don't know what it's like.
Every single girl does.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.379
[Mrs. Davis] Your hair.

03:54.190 --> 03:57.353
You always tell me how much you like it
when it's straight.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.352
Oh, Jess, you are beautiful either way.

04:06.240 --> 04:09.073
Honey, I know this is all
very frightening,

04:09.990 --> 04:12.902
but you'll do right by Hannah
as long as you tell the truth.

04:13.620 --> 04:17.124
-You are not on trial, don't forget that.
-Yeah, Mom, I know.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.718
[Jessica] Even boys who mean well
want to tell you who you are.

04:29.180 --> 04:29.999
Hi.

04:34.730 --> 04:35.549
Hi.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.814
I, uh, I saw your mom
heading for the cafeteria,

04:39.900 --> 04:42.027
so I took my chances.

04:46.280 --> 04:50.023
-I told her it wasn't your fault.
-Isn't it a little bit my fault?

04:50.540 --> 04:51.359
No.

04:54.460 --> 04:56.200
I brought you flowers.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.666
Which now seems, uh, like, a little wrong?

04:59.750 --> 05:01.741
I don't know. Maybe I should've gotten you
a stuffed thing.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.660
This place has a stellar gift shop.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.006
What happened to your face?

05:06.880 --> 05:09.007
Uh, stupid bike thing.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.139
I tried to cut through some trees
in the dark. It doesn't matter.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.390
You matter.

05:20.940 --> 05:21.975
Are you okay?

05:23.740 --> 05:26.948
[sighs] My mom just freaked out.
It was not serious.

05:29.160 --> 05:29.979
It was surgery.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.903
It was stitches, mostly.

05:34.950 --> 05:38.954
-We had a deal.
-It was a stupid deal.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.581
You told me cutting didn't mean
you wanted to die.

05:42.670 --> 05:46.549
I don't wanna die.
I told you that and you don't understand.

05:47.470 --> 05:49.426
-Then help me.
-I can't.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.000
Because I don't understand it either.

05:55.270 --> 05:58.979
It's like I have all of these feelings,
and I can't control them,

05:59.940 --> 06:03.182
like I'm a visitor in my own mind.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.892
And if I don't catch my breath,
I'll burn up and blow away.

06:07.610 --> 06:12.980
And I know you wanna save me from that,
and I love you for it, but you can't.

06:14.240 --> 06:15.537
Then what can I do?

06:15.620 --> 06:20.569
You can figure out your own shit,
and I will figure out mine. Apart.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.582
Wait, you're-- you're breaking up with me?

06:26.130 --> 06:27.165
I'm sorry.

06:29.380 --> 06:30.335
I love you.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.597
I know. That's...

06:34.970 --> 06:36.847
[sighs] That's why I'm telling you to go.

06:39.480 --> 06:42.768
-This isn't fair.
-We have to be done, Clay. I'm sorry.

06:55.030 --> 06:57.157
I'm not just going to disappear
from your life.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.649
You already do.

07:00.870 --> 07:03.623
You-- You think about Hannah,
and you disappear.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.256
So just do it for real this time.

07:26.940 --> 07:30.103
[Jessica] So we just start expecting them
to put a label on us.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.566
_ -DykeI
[laughter]

07:35.830 --> 07:37.070

07:38.740 --> 07:40.196
-Lesbo!
-Lesbian!

07:43.120 --> 07:44.997

07:55.510 --> 07:56.920
Welcome to the team.

07:57.180 --> 07:58.966
Don't start with me, Ryan.

07:59.060 --> 08:00.550
Hey, it happens when you're ready.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.471
I came out when I was five.
I didn't really have a choice.

08:03.770 --> 08:04.976
Guess I was just born fabulous.

08:07.020 --> 08:11.684
-I'm just glad you made it out.
-Yeah. Me, too.

08:13.200 --> 08:16.613
If you start driving a Subaru and wearing
flannel, I will hold an intervention.

08:16.700 --> 08:17.735
Be warned.

08:24.540 --> 08:27.338
-Holy shit, Alex.
-Yeah.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.740
[sighs] Who's doing this?

08:42.430 --> 08:45.763
-Hey, can you tell whose handwriting?
-Jesus, put it down.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.147
Sorry. I just...

08:48.980 --> 08:53.599
-I'm really sorry, Alex.
-So you're not alone in this.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.658
Sorry I said that.
That was really shitty, I'm just--

08:58.450 --> 09:02.284
-[sighs] This is just a lot.
-I get it. I know.

09:04.410 --> 09:05.399
Wait, your hair is different.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.991
-It's court hair.
-I don't like it.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.297
[scoffs] Noted.

09:13.300 --> 09:14.540
What the hell happened to your face?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.756
Someone ran me off the road last night.

09:20.970 --> 09:23.677
Someone in what looked
like a black Range Rover.

09:24.390 --> 09:26.472
-Bryce.
-You're not testifying.

09:27.140 --> 09:29.552
-Does he know that?
-I don't think it matters.

09:29.650 --> 09:31.470
Whoever it is,
they're coming after all of us.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.316
This came in the mail for me yesterday.

09:38.450 --> 09:40.406
-[Clay] Jesus.
-This is nuts.

09:41.530 --> 09:43.942
-We have to fucking stop him.
-How?

09:44.660 --> 09:47.868
I'm a cripple and you'll get grounded
for life if you even speak to him.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.207
Yeah, I promised my mom
I'd stay away from him.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.747
But if he's coming after me,
then what can I do?

09:54.880 --> 09:56.461
[laughs]

09:57.300 --> 09:59.177
-[Bryce] What up?
-[Scott] What's up, guys?

10:01.050 --> 10:02.176
Are we even sure it's him?

10:02.260 --> 10:04.342
[Monty] Your boy keeps looking
at you, Zach.

10:04.430 --> 10:06.671
-Does he need his diaper changed?
-Shut up, Monty.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.726
Why don't you go take care of him?
Dempsey,

10:08.810 --> 10:10.801
it's normal for nurses
to fall for their patients.

10:11.020 --> 10:13.068
[Zach] Fuck off.
I don't even like him, okay?

10:13.150 --> 10:16.642
Right. It's just your mom who makes
you carry his books and wipe his ass.

10:16.740 --> 10:18.810
-[laughter]
-No, the ass he does for pleasure.

10:24.580 --> 10:25.569
What if it's Zach?

10:26.950 --> 10:29.532
That's crazy.
He's been helping you with everything.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.627
Then why's he still hanging around Bryce?

10:31.710 --> 10:33.337
[Clay]
It's Bryce or someone protecting him.

10:34.250 --> 10:36.002
He doesn't want the truth to come out.

10:41.340 --> 10:44.093
-Why are you guys both looking at me?
-Um...

10:45.010 --> 10:47.387
Mostly 'cause you're sitting
across the table from us?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.471
You can tell them what happened to you
in court.

10:49.560 --> 10:52.438
Hannah's lawyers told me I'm just supposed
to talk about the Hot or Not List

10:52.520 --> 10:53.646
and how it ended our friendship.

10:53.770 --> 10:56.648
But you know that's not true
or it's not all that's true.

10:56.730 --> 10:59.392
-And they know it.
-But it's not part of the case.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.446
If you say it, it'll make it
part of the case.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.736
So I just say it?

11:03.240 --> 11:04.070
Jess, I--

11:05.530 --> 11:09.239
Listen. I know it's not easy, okay?

11:09.330 --> 11:11.821
Like, in no fucking universe
do I think that, but...

11:13.540 --> 11:16.623
If you tell the truth when they ask you
about your friendship,

11:16.710 --> 11:19.759
if you tell them the real reason
you stopped speaking to Hannah,

11:19.840 --> 11:21.330
then the truth is out.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.638
And this shit stops.
And Bryce gets what's coming to him.

11:25.930 --> 11:28.763
-I gotta get to first.
-Jess--

11:28.850 --> 11:31.512
You know, the truth doesn't
always make things right.

11:32.270 --> 11:34.056
You should know that better than anyone.

11:41.490 --> 11:44.482
Look, I need to remember what happened.

11:44.570 --> 11:46.731
I need the tapes.
You have to stop protecting me.

11:47.030 --> 11:50.534
-Slqe's in the hospital.
-What? What happened?

11:53.290 --> 11:54.370
I stopped protecting her.

11:56.250 --> 12:00.209
Okay, fine. Then do this for me.
Get me a ride to court today.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.829
-Alex--
-Clay.

12:06.720 --> 12:11.339
Jessica! Wow.
Oh, my God, you look amazing.

12:12.020 --> 12:14.147
-I love your hair.
-Yeah, thanks.

12:14.230 --> 12:18.724
Oh, that's right, you have court today.
Good luck, you'll be great.

12:20.230 --> 12:23.563
-Listen, about yesterday--
-It's fine. We're good.

12:23.650 --> 12:27.654
Cool. 'Cause we girls have to be strong
together, you know? Own our own shit.

12:29.240 --> 12:32.368
-I'm sorry if--
-No, no, no, right. I get it.

12:32.460 --> 12:35.418
Okay. Well, we'll miss you
at practice today.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.411
-Yeah. Thanks.
-Good luck!

12:37.670 --> 12:40.798
[Jessica] Sometimes it seems like
no matter what you do...

12:40.880 --> 12:42.962
[indistinct chattering]

12:43.050 --> 12:44.256
[silence]

12:46.890 --> 12:48.130
What's going on?

12:50.060 --> 12:52.517
[Jessica] ...people still see you
the way they want to.

13:01.320 --> 13:02.139
Who did this?

13:19.750 --> 13:20.626
Hey, are you okay?

13:20.710 --> 13:24.714
What? Why are you following me?
Just leave me alone.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.629
You think she'll talk?

13:33.720 --> 13:35.426
-Why would she?
-Why did you?

13:38.150 --> 13:40.186
Don't you get tired of hiding, Marcus?

13:41.610 --> 13:44.397
-Don't you wanna tell the truth sometimes?
-There's more than one truth.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.815
No, I don't think there is.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.209
-More press today.
-You know, you can talk to them.

13:59.670 --> 14:00.568
I don't think so.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.298
The longer you wait,
the harder it is to reclaim the narrative.

14:03.380 --> 14:05.837
-It's not my style, Jackie.
-You can make it your style.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.927
You speak for Hannah now,
and thousands of girls like her.

14:09.970 --> 14:12.848
Jessica Davis will show up for Hannah.
She's a good kid.

14:12.930 --> 14:16.514
And she's been very open
about the culture of sexism at the school.

14:17.430 --> 14:19.227
Most importantly, she's Hannah's friend.

14:23.570 --> 14:25.891
[Jessica]
But even when things get really tough...

14:27.280 --> 14:28.269
[bangs]

14:36.620 --> 14:39.828
...all it takes is just one friend
to get you through it.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.955
[Cyrus] Asshole.

14:42.790 --> 14:43.620
Hey.

14:43.710 --> 14:46.338
[Jessica]
If you're luclq, you find more than one.

14:46.420 --> 14:48.627
Toby, Eric, Chad, this is Tyler,

14:48.970 --> 14:52.428
my fellow ASS-class colleague
and extreme outcast.

14:52.680 --> 14:53.886
-What up?
-Hey, Tyler.

14:53.970 --> 14:57.519
-Yo.
-You shoot film? Super retro.

14:58.020 --> 14:59.009
Yeah. Uh...

15:00.560 --> 15:04.473
I don't know. There's something to holding
a picture, like feeling it, I don't know.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.687
Yeah. No, like, um, flipping
through a photo album

15:07.780 --> 15:09.236
instead of swiping on your phone.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.618
-Yeah, exactly.
-[chuckles]

15:12.700 --> 15:15.328
-Uh, I'm Tyler.
-Oh, I know. Mackenzie.

15:15.830 --> 15:16.899
Quiet, freaks.

15:25.630 --> 15:27.951
[Jessica] You find friends
who see through the labels.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.381
[Tony] I got it, I got it, I got it.

15:33.470 --> 15:36.257
-Thanks for the ride, Tony.
-Oh, I'm coming in with you guys.

15:37.810 --> 15:39.971
But you're on the witness list.
They check it.

15:40.060 --> 15:41.436
No, I got my brother's ID.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.266
I haven't slept in two nights.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.316
I just wanna know
what I'm looking at in there.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.395
What if you're on the list?

15:49.490 --> 15:52.311
I'll just wave my cane and cry.
It works everywhere.

15:54.660 --> 15:56.525
Wait. I bet there's
a handicapped entrance.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.326
Don't think you're supposed to say
"handicapped."

15:58.410 --> 16:00.116
-Take my arm.
-Fuck you both.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.240
[Jessica] I found those friends.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.917
That list just messed up everything.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.838
[Dennis] And was this list typical
of your experience at Liberty?

16:12.930 --> 16:14.124
Yes.

16:14.300 --> 16:18.213
Hannah was already labeled a slut.
That list just made everything worse.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.959
The truth didn't matter.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.925
That's just what they do to girls
at our school.

16:22.690 --> 16:24.760
I mean, I found these...

16:26.560 --> 16:28.187
just this morning, in my math class--

16:28.270 --> 16:30.431
Objection, these photos were not admitted
into evidence--

16:30.530 --> 16:32.896
They take one photo and it defines you,

16:33.150 --> 16:35.732
and then it becomes your job
to prove everyone wrong.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.903
This is what they did to Hannah,
and now they're doing it to me!

16:38.990 --> 16:39.820
[gavel banging]

16:39.910 --> 16:41.286
[judge] Order! Order!

16:47.460 --> 16:49.030
I can't believe he let them in.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.167
Well, they're inflammatory,
but they're relevant.

16:54.550 --> 16:55.369
Dennis.

16:57.470 --> 17:00.928
She's the girl on tape nine.
Ask her. I know she is.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.306
I can't ask her that, Olivia.
It's not relevant.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.687
It's as relevant as the pictures.

17:04.770 --> 17:07.933
It shows how the boys treated the girls
at that school,

17:08.020 --> 17:09.931
and that the school knew about it.

17:10.020 --> 17:13.433
But it didn't happen at school.
And Bryce isn't on trial.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.821
[judge] All right,
both parties will allow these photos,

17:22.290 --> 17:27.705
now Plaintiff's Exhibit 12, into evidence.

17:27.790 --> 17:31.374
-Ms. Struhl.
-Miss Davis, did you report these photos?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.706
-No.
-So you're telling me

17:33.800 --> 17:36.712
that you expect the school
to take action to protect you,

17:36.800 --> 17:38.256
but you don't tell them when an incident

17:38.340 --> 17:40.251
they're supposed
to protect you from even occurs?

17:41.180 --> 17:43.637
IfI felt like I could trust the school,
maybe I would have.

17:44.600 --> 17:49.606
Maybe Hannah would have. Oh, that's right.
She did, and look what happened.

17:50.610 --> 17:51.929
Move to strike as non-responsive.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.358
The jury will disregard
the witness's last answer.

17:55.780 --> 17:58.692
Miss Davis,
did you report the Hot or Not List?

17:59.450 --> 18:00.439
-No._
-Because, In fact,

18:00.530 --> 18:02.657
it wasn't the list _ _
that broke up your friendship, was It?

18:02.740 --> 18:03.570
It was.

18:05.160 --> 18:08.038
Do you know who put your name
and Hannah's name on the list?

18:08.790 --> 18:10.576
-Yes.
-Who?

18:14.880 --> 18:15.790
Alex Standall.

18:16.550 --> 18:18.757
And isn't it true that Alex Standall
was your boyfriend

18:18.840 --> 18:20.637
and that Hannah was jealous of that?

18:20.720 --> 18:25.419
No. We were all friends... at first.

18:26.850 --> 18:30.229
For a while, if you saw one of us,
you saw all three of us.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.518
If you're waiting for, like, the perfect
moment to choreograph your first kiss,

18:33.610 --> 18:34.929
you're gonna die a virgin.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.689
-I just want it to be special.
-Your standards are way too high.

18:39.780 --> 18:41.316
You need to lower them
like the rest of us.

18:41.410 --> 18:42.229
[Jessica chuckles]

18:42.320 --> 18:46.438
Okay, wait.
Never have I ever never been kissed.

18:46.540 --> 18:49.282
-Too soon. Too soon.
-DrInk, Hannah.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.668
-It's Sprite.
-It's fake Sprite.

18:51.750 --> 18:54.799
-It's Twist Up, actually.
-Your mom is so cheap.

18:54.880 --> 18:57.917
-That's so rude!
-What the fuck kind of name is Twist Up?

18:58.010 --> 18:59.375
When did this become a game?

18:59.550 --> 19:03.919
Okay. Never have I ever kissed
my best friend.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.348
And I don't really like
this generic shit, so...

19:08.430 --> 19:10.432
[pop music plays softly on radio]

19:13.860 --> 19:15.976
I love you anyway

19:16.110 --> 19:17.475
[chuckling]

19:19.110 --> 19:21.271
Well, uh, we're all best friends.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.567
-[Jessica laughs]
- I love you anyway

19:25.990 --> 19:27.366
[girls kiss]

19:30.080 --> 19:30.956
[chuckles]

19:34.670 --> 19:36.797
[laughter]

19:38.630 --> 19:42.179
Wouldn't you love a love life?

19:42.470 --> 19:46.099
Wouldn't you love a love life?

19:46.350 --> 19:52.220
Wouldn't you love a love life?

20:01.700 --> 20:03.770
[Jessica]
Our relationship started heating up.

20:03.860 --> 20:05.316
-I swear...
-Oh, shit.

20:05.950 --> 20:09.238
-What are you doing, crazy?
-I thought she was off Wednesdays.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.826
But I tried to be sensitive to Hannah.

20:13.370 --> 20:15.031
-Let's go to Monet's.
-Oh, my God, relax.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.199
She's not into me, Jess.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.127
Ever hear of girl code?
It doesn't matter if she's into you.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.750
So, what are we doing?

20:22.510 --> 20:24.887
I'll show up first,
you wait, like, three minutes.

20:24.970 --> 20:28.258
And when Hannah tells you I'm inside,
just be like, "Oh, my God, small world."

20:28.600 --> 20:30.010
-Okay?
-Seriously?

20:30.680 --> 20:32.011
Ninth row. I'll see you in there.

20:32.560 --> 20:34.642
-Okay, I get the aisle.
-You wish.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.430
But of course, he didn't wait.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.186
He didn't get what it would feel like
for a girl.

20:42.860 --> 20:46.614
-Yeah, we're just, uh, hanging out.
-Together.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.578
So I see. Ten dollars, please.

20:57.830 --> 20:58.660
Thanks.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.580
[cash register whirring]

21:05.130 --> 21:09.248
Hey, if you want, we can go
grab coffee together afterwards.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.631
Oh, uh, I don't want to intrude.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.052
[chuckles] Intrude? Like you'd ever.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.767
Jess, we're gonna miss the trailers.

21:17.980 --> 21:21.859
Go. Enjoy the movie. I--
You know, we can catch up whenever.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.527
Jesus,
you're always putting me on the spot.

21:29.620 --> 21:32.441
Fuck girl code.
Hannah's above all that shit.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.438
I guess.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.036
-She seemed cool, right?
-Yes!

21:37.750 --> 21:39.786
Can we just enjoy
our first real date, please?

21:43.590 --> 21:46.332
[Jessica]
Actually, Hannah was pretty okay with it.

21:46.800 --> 21:50.213
Even though I chose a boy
over my friendship with a girl.

21:58.310 --> 22:01.222
-Thanks.
-So, when did you two start...

22:03.820 --> 22:07.642
Um, I don't know. Not that long ago.

22:07.740 --> 22:09.901
After we all hung out at her house
that night, I guess.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.732
So, after we all kissed,
you just picked her?

22:12.990 --> 22:17.859
It's not like that. We just...
We have more in common.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.417
So, what, are you trying
to have sex with her now or something?

22:20.500 --> 22:23.958
_ What? No. _
Why IS that any of your busmess, anyway?

22:24.050 --> 22:27.963
Well, because a few weeks ago, we were
best friends, sharing all our secrets,

22:28.050 --> 22:31.713
and now, apparently, you guys have all
these new secrets that I'm not a part of.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.256
Not everything's about you, Hannah.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.766
I was wrong about Hannah
being cool with us dating.

22:43.860 --> 22:49.309
She, like, lost her shit at the snack bar.
She's totally jealous, like, obsessed.

22:49.610 --> 22:51.316
-Shut up, really?
-Yeah.

22:52.410 --> 22:55.732
-What did she say?
-A lot. She's hurt.

22:58.080 --> 23:01.208
But, Jess, I don't want to break up
over someone else's drama.

23:01.290 --> 23:02.120
Neven

23:04.250 --> 23:09.256
But we should probably just, you know,
back off until she gets over it.

23:09.510 --> 23:10.795
-[audience member] Shh!
-Yeah.

23:12.340 --> 23:14.171
-Here.
-Thank you.

23:14.260 --> 23:17.138
[Jessica] From that point,
Alex and I kept things cool.

23:17.930 --> 23:22.640
But when Hannah found out that he made
that list, it was too much for her.

23:22.730 --> 23:27.599
So you blame the Hot or Not List,
and the culture at Liberty,

23:27.690 --> 23:30.067
_ but isn't it true
that It was Hannah's jealousy

23:30.150 --> 23:31.196
that ended your friendship?

23:31.820 --> 23:33.196
No. It was the list.

23:33.910 --> 23:36.731
After you broke up with Alex,
did your friendship with Hannah resume?

23:38.330 --> 23:39.866
-No.
-Because you started

23:39.960 --> 23:42.531
-dating Justin Foley, correct?
-No.

23:42.620 --> 23:44.030
So you didn't date Justin Foley?

23:44.330 --> 23:48.369
-No, I did--
-Hannah was jealous of you and Justin,

23:48.840 --> 23:51.081
just like she was jealous
of you and Alex, wasn't she?

23:51.170 --> 23:53.502
-No, that's not true.
-How do you know?

23:55.720 --> 23:58.211
-[Sonya] Jessica, how do you know?
-How do you know?

24:00.390 --> 24:04.895
Jessica, isn't it true that Hannah Baker
was jealous, and vindictive,

24:04.980 --> 24:06.936
-and that is why your friendship ended?
-No.

24:07.110 --> 24:10.238
Well, the prosecution claims
that it was the Hot or Not List,

24:10.570 --> 24:13.152
but it was simply Hannah's own jealousy,
isn't that correct?

24:16.120 --> 24:18.111
There's no other reason, is there?

24:19.580 --> 24:20.569
[Sonya] Jessica.

24:27.540 --> 24:31.089
Jessica? Is there any other reason
that we haven't mentioned?

24:34.930 --> 24:37.046
No. There's no other reason.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.129
[Sonya] I see.

24:41.060 --> 24:42.266
No further questions.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.101
-I gotta go.
-You're leaving? She's not done.

24:53.450 --> 24:54.644
[Clay] I heard enough.

24:57.280 --> 25:01.159
-Yeah, me, too. You coming?
-I'll leave when Jess is done.

25:01.410 --> 25:02.570
Did you really kiss Hannah?

25:03.960 --> 25:05.075
Yeah. It was a friend thing.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.877
[water running]

25:13.550 --> 25:14.926
[door opening]

25:19.430 --> 25:22.467
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.881
No, Hannah was my friend,
I just wanted to help her.

25:24.980 --> 25:26.186
You did, honey. You did.

25:26.270 --> 25:28.511
[cries]

25:30.320 --> 25:31.139
Jessica.

25:32.690 --> 25:34.180
[panﬁng]

25:36.320 --> 25:37.150
Is there...

25:38.490 --> 25:41.152
-Is there something you wanna tell me?
-What?

25:41.490 --> 25:47.827
We've all been so focused on Hannah,
maybe we should be worried about you.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.999
-No, no. I'm-- I'm fine.
-I've listened to the tapes.

25:54.460 --> 25:56.041
I-- I've listened to the tapes.

25:56.880 --> 26:00.338
I'm sorry, I... I should go.

26:06.730 --> 26:07.549
Jess.

26:10.150 --> 26:11.356
I can't do it.

26:12.190 --> 26:15.523
-What can I do to help?
-You can leave.

26:30.670 --> 26:35.334
[stammers] Hey, excuse me, I'm looking
for Skye Miller. I was here earlier.

26:35.710 --> 26:38.508
-She's been transferred.
-To another floor?

26:38.680 --> 26:41.137
-Another facility.
-What? Where?

26:41.220 --> 26:44.508
Look, kid, I'm sorry.
I can't tell you that. Only family.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.637
Why do you assume that her family
gives more of a shit about her than I do?

26:47.730 --> 26:50.392
I don't assume that. The laws do.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.265
Right.

26:58.030 --> 27:03.900
-She's safe. It's a good program.
-Which you can't tell me anything about.

27:03.990 --> 27:06.823
For what it's worth,
what she's going through isn't about you.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.828
You're not the first boyfriend
to sit here all night,

27:09.910 --> 27:11.491
wondering what he did,
when it wasn't him at all.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.952
It's not your fault.
Give her some space, kid.

27:16.800 --> 27:18.040
And give yourself a break.

27:23.550 --> 27:25.552
[line ringing]

27:26.430 --> 27:28.512
[voicemail]
You've reached Skye, leave a message.

27:29.140 --> 27:32.018
Slqe. Uh, it's me again. I...

27:32.940 --> 27:36.148
I went by your house, but no one was home.

27:36.570 --> 27:37.434
[sighs]

27:37.530 --> 27:39.930
Where are you? Where did they send you?

27:40.030 --> 27:44.569
Like, I just--
Please just let me know you're okay.

27:46.240 --> 27:49.494
[stammers] I promise, I'm not trying
to talk or anything. I just...

27:51.330 --> 27:54.538
I need to know you're all right. Okay?

27:56.420 --> 27:57.239
[sighs]

27:58.710 --> 27:59.540
Bye.

28:06.850 --> 28:08.306
I'm sorry about Skye.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.090
-No, you're not.
-I am.

28:11.180 --> 28:14.013
Every day, it's something new with you.
Something I didn't know.

28:14.100 --> 28:18.309
First it was the Tyler thing and now
you've kissed, like, half the school.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.187
-Seriously, you believe that?
-Justin, Courtney, Alex...

28:21.280 --> 28:23.657
-And you.
-Yeah, I remember, thank you.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.526
So what, your feelings are hurt

28:25.620 --> 28:28.737
and you're angry at me
and angry at Jessica,

28:28.830 --> 28:31.151
you miss Slqe,
and the whole fucking world is unfair.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.456
That sums it up pretty well.

28:32.870 --> 28:35.998
You're not the guy to sit on his hands
and wait for someone else to save the day.

28:36.290 --> 28:37.416
What else can I do?

28:38.920 --> 28:41.502
I got his fucking confession, Hannah.

28:42.510 --> 28:44.831
And I had to go to the hospital,
did we discuss that yet?

28:44.930 --> 28:46.841
The fact that I was shitting blood
the next night?

28:47.390 --> 28:49.597
My mom wanted to go after him
for beating the shit out of me,

28:49.680 --> 28:52.888
except I went to his house to buy drugs,
and I'd just gotten suspended for drugs,

28:52.980 --> 28:53.844
so can't do that.

28:54.390 --> 28:57.439
But that was okay,
because I had his confession. Right?

28:57.520 --> 29:00.068
What's a little internal bleeding
when you can take down a rapist?

29:00.150 --> 29:03.028
And then the school heard it,
and all the lavwers heard it,

29:03.110 --> 29:04.816
and no one did a goddamn thing.

29:06.990 --> 29:09.982
Because there's no evidence,
there's no DNA.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.742
They just have your accusation,
and you're... [sighs]

29:13.500 --> 29:14.319
I'm dead.

29:17.670 --> 29:20.662
-He's gonna get away with everything.
-But he doesn't have to.

29:21.050 --> 29:23.291
Don't do nothing
because you're pissed off.

29:24.090 --> 29:28.208
Okay? Or afraid. Or sad.
Don't let Bryce get away with it.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.052
You'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.841
Look, Jessica is evidence
that the problem is getting worse.

29:37.940 --> 29:40.602
Her testimony was strong. Trust me,
the jury heard me on the redirect--

29:40.690 --> 29:43.853
You know what else the jury heard?
That my daughter is a jealous slut.

29:43.940 --> 29:46.568
And that's just today.
You think they're gonna forget that?

29:47.360 --> 29:49.908
Ms. Baker, Austin James
with the Evergreen County Register.

29:49.990 --> 29:52.288
-We've been live-blogging the trial--
-I know who you are.

29:54.950 --> 29:56.451
Yesterday you wrote that my daughter

29:56.540 --> 29:59.373
is an "exhibitionist
with low self-esteem."

29:59.460 --> 30:00.700
-Olivia--
-Let her speak.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.544
Well, it sounds like that "exhibitionist"
had a rough go of it at Liberty High.

30:05.630 --> 30:10.636
Sounds like she could have used a friend.
But that girl is not my daughter.

30:10.800 --> 30:13.633
Okay, that is not
the real Hannah Baker, okay?

30:13.720 --> 30:17.053
That is a character
that the defense attorney created,

30:17.310 --> 30:20.097
a girl whose life meant so little,
apparently,

30:20.190 --> 30:22.146
that her classmates
can't even speak about her.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.733
Hannah was not a liar or a slut
or a mean gIrl.

30:27.780 --> 30:30.692
She was a good friend,
and she had her friend's back.

30:32.740 --> 30:34.731
[voice cracks]
The problem is no one had hers.

30:35.700 --> 30:39.704
I understand. Olivia, what about you?
Her friends didn't have her back. Did you?

30:40.330 --> 30:41.911
That's enough. Come on.

30:42.090 --> 30:44.297
[indistinct chattering]

30:48.220 --> 30:49.585
[Jessica] Do boys have it easier?

30:50.470 --> 30:51.425
I think so.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.590
I don't know.

30:55.140 --> 30:58.428
Motherfucker! You know his slider
fucks with me, Dempsey!

30:58.520 --> 30:59.555
Quit calling that shit.

30:59.810 --> 31:02.222
-That wasn't a slider, dude.
-You're fucking with me.

31:02.940 --> 31:04.601
-Curve all the way.
-Rea|ly?

31:06.280 --> 31:07.099
[sighs]

31:07.360 --> 31:10.909
-The fuck is my problem?
-I think we both know, man.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.197
No. This doesn't have shit
to do with her, okay?

31:13.950 --> 31:16.191
My mom told me you got called
to testify for the school.

31:16.290 --> 31:18.030
-My fucking mom--
-Why didn't you tell me?

31:18.120 --> 31:19.951
Didn't want it announced
to your new best friend.

31:20.040 --> 31:24.454
Alex and I, we're not tight like that.
We don't talk about shit that matters.

31:26.670 --> 31:29.377
-Who else knows?
-My parents. Our lawyer.

31:30.880 --> 31:33.337
Hey, if you guys want
to suck each other's dicks,

31:33.430 --> 31:37.014
-there's a place for that, you know?
-Yeah. Monty's house.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.552
Nobody else needs to know.
I got your back.

31:43.690 --> 31:47.808
-Yeah. No, I know that, man. Thank you.
-Got you.

31:49.490 --> 31:53.779
-[man] You've had quite a year.
-Hmm. Yeah. You can say that.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.485
-Two suicides.
-One.

31:56.700 --> 31:59.248
One attempt.
And he's on the road to recovery.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.661
Everyone around here
is watching that trial.

32:03.420 --> 32:05.490
Parents holding the school responsible...

32:07.420 --> 32:12.119
-We are responsible, aren't we?
-To an extent. But there are limits.

32:12.590 --> 32:15.718
Mm. Yeah, there are always limits.

32:19.220 --> 32:22.929
Have you considered holding off
on the job search until the trial's over?

32:24.270 --> 32:28.263
Yes. But I have a family to support.

32:29.980 --> 32:34.519
And I'm a heck of an educator.
And I care about kids.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.406
Why not stay at Liberty?

32:40.080 --> 32:41.069
I was hoping to...

32:42.290 --> 32:43.279
[chuckles]

32:44.080 --> 32:45.115
...to do better.

32:45.210 --> 32:49.419
Find a place where I can make
a difference, you know?

32:49.500 --> 32:51.331
Make kids' lives better.

32:54.590 --> 32:56.467
There's only so much
we can do, though, right?

32:56.800 --> 32:59.553
We can't go online,
we can't go home with them every night.

32:59.640 --> 33:02.552
We only have those kids for a few hours
a day, we can't be everywhere.

33:02.770 --> 33:05.728
[Mr. Porter groans, scoffs]

33:06.730 --> 33:09.563
Yeah, I used to think that,
but I don't think that anymore.

33:10.480 --> 33:13.779
I think we can try.
Thank you for your time.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.361
[Mr. Davis] I told you we should've
pulled her from that school.

33:18.450 --> 33:20.657
[Mrs. Davis] Then what?
Keep her home for the rest of her life?

33:20.740 --> 33:22.287
[Mr. Davis] We can't rely on the school.

33:22.450 --> 33:26.489
If we can't trust our own daughter
to come to us when she's being harassed,

33:26.580 --> 33:28.878
how can we protect you, Jessica?

33:29.000 --> 33:30.206
-[Mrs. Davis] Jessica?
-What?

33:31.380 --> 33:33.712
Honey, why didn't you tell us
that you were being harassed?

33:34.130 --> 33:35.427
[whispers] I don't know.

33:36.300 --> 33:38.336
-[Mr. Davis] What about the group?
-[groans]

33:38.680 --> 33:40.466
Can you talk
to one of the other survivors?

33:40.560 --> 33:42.425
God, Dad, I hate that word.

33:43.770 --> 33:47.092
Survivor? I'm just me.

33:49.690 --> 33:50.850
[doorbell rings]

33:51.980 --> 33:52.810
I'll get it.

33:54.650 --> 33:56.777
I was flashing back to the police station.

33:58.110 --> 34:00.738
When my dad made me go,
after I told him about that night.

34:02.450 --> 34:04.611
And I told them
I couldn't remember who did it.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.878
I couldn't tell them it was Bryce
because I knew they wouldn't believe me.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.916
But that's not true. We believe you.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.831
If you go to the police,
we can back you up--

34:12.920 --> 34:15.377
You can't. You weren't there.

34:16.550 --> 34:22.307
Hannah's gone, and she was
sweet and sensitive and white.

34:22.970 --> 34:25.052
Look at what they're doing to her.
Don't you get it?

34:25.680 --> 34:28.183
I'm not the right kind of victim
to go against Bryce Walker.

34:28.270 --> 34:31.649
-Not when it's his word against mine.
-What if Justin were here?

34:32.480 --> 34:38.771
What if Hannah were here?
She's dead, and Justin might as well be.

34:39.820 --> 34:40.775
Have you heard from him?

34:44.450 --> 34:47.203
I'm tired of talking about this, Clay.

34:47.540 --> 34:50.668
I'm tired of thinking about it
every second of every day.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.702
-I know.
-No, you don't. You have no idea.

34:57.550 --> 35:01.714
I'm tired of staring at my closet,
wondering what people are gonna think.

35:03.390 --> 35:07.099
Wondering what I can wear
that'll cover the most skin.

35:09.230 --> 35:10.720
What I can hide in.

35:17.150 --> 35:20.062
Oh. I need a finer dice
on those onions, Tyler.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.777
Sorry, my mom usually does this stuff.
I don't really know what I'm doing.

35:23.870 --> 35:25.235
Give it, give it, give it.

35:25.830 --> 35:28.902
Huh, huh, huh. Huh, huh, huh.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.743
Mothers who baby their sons
raise men ill-equipped for life.

35:33.920 --> 35:35.410
It's a patriarchal tragedy.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.503
No, what's tragic
is Liberty fucking High School.

35:38.590 --> 35:41.081
-Right?
-Today we had a sub in ASS-class

35:41.180 --> 35:44.547
and she took your copy of The Lottery
because it "glamorizes violence."

35:44.640 --> 35:47.097
What? She must not have read it closely.

35:47.470 --> 35:49.017
That's the thing. She hasn't read it.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.591
-[chuckles] What?
-It's the Liberty way.

35:52.270 --> 35:55.478
Yep. Ban books, and celebrate guys
who can hit a baseball real hard.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.606
[groans] I went through the same bullshit.

35:58.110 --> 35:58.929
Yeah?

35:59.030 --> 36:02.852
-Scapegoating, mob mentality.
-Yeah, I should've fought back.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.026
Kinda hard to do when you have no power.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.286
Who says you have no power?

36:09.040 --> 36:11.110
-The world?
-Well, don't listen to the world.

36:11.660 --> 36:14.663
If you don't fit into one of their boxes,
they wanna punish you, but don't let them.

36:16.420 --> 36:19.162
-Rea| heroes fuck shit up.
-Mm.

36:20.010 --> 36:21.295
More like resist. But yes.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.211
[door opening, closing]

36:23.300 --> 36:25.541
-[Mackenzie] Hi.
-Oh, glad you could join us.

36:25.640 --> 36:27.710
Oh, bite me, Cy-Cy.

36:27.810 --> 36:29.926
-You're on salad duty.
-Okay.

36:30.390 --> 36:31.721
-Hey, Tyler.
-Oh, hey.

36:32.980 --> 36:34.686
-Sorry I'm late, Dad.
-That's all right.

36:35.690 --> 36:39.478
-Oh, wait, so you're--
-Chronically late. You'll get used to it.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.112
[man] Some are calling this lawsuit
a witch hunt,

36:50.540 --> 36:54.829
but I have faith that our son
will bring the same integrity and honesty

36:54.920 --> 36:57.377
that got him into Harvard
into that courtroom tomorrow.

36:57.880 --> 37:03.329
[sighs] Dear Lord, please be with Marcus
during his testimony.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.422
We believe you will stand strong with us.

37:05.510 --> 37:07.046
-We believe--
-Thank you so much, Dad.

37:08.010 --> 37:10.387
Now let's get back
to stuffing those envelopes. All right?

37:10.470 --> 37:12.176
Election's less than two weeks away!

37:13.850 --> 37:15.090
[indistinct chattering]

37:18.060 --> 37:19.971
A prayer? You don't have to worry, Dad.

37:20.230 --> 37:24.940
I'm not worried about you.
I know you, but I also know how things go.

37:25.030 --> 37:28.193
They can turn a victim into a villain,
a monster into a martyr.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.738
I promise. It won't affect
the election, Dad. Really.

37:31.870 --> 37:36.409
This isn't about the election, son.
It's about protecting you.

37:37.330 --> 37:39.332
Look, the rules are different for us.

37:40.250 --> 37:45.370
[sighs]
Look, just be smart, all right, be humble,

37:45.470 --> 37:47.791
and don't let them put words
in your mouth.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.137
-Just be you. All right?
-All right.

38:06.070 --> 38:07.526
You still gotta breathe.

38:08.660 --> 38:09.558
Fuck you.

38:09.660 --> 38:12.026
-If you can curse, you can breathe.
-[cell phone chimes]

38:13.790 --> 38:15.860
Hey, hey. You still got ten minutes.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.787
You're not just cheating yourself,
you're cheating me.

38:18.870 --> 38:20.701
And, you know, your probation officer.

38:20.790 --> 38:24.499
-I'm sorry. I gotta... I gotta go.
-Hot date?

38:24.590 --> 38:27.218
-[scoffs] That's funny.
-Why is that funny?

38:27.880 --> 38:28.756
Uh...

38:29.260 --> 38:32.468
-Because I got dumped last month.
-You? Got dumped?

38:32.680 --> 38:33.590
Believe it.

38:33.970 --> 38:35.881
What kind of foolish woman
would let you go?

38:40.310 --> 38:41.140
Foolish guy?

38:42.480 --> 38:43.560
Yeah, guy.

38:44.730 --> 38:49.235
Well. That is one foolish, foolish guy.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.207
[rock music plays softly over speakers]

39:03.960 --> 39:05.700
[chuckles]
Why the fuck would I know anything

39:05.800 --> 39:07.665
about how to find someone in the city?

39:08.340 --> 39:10.717
I don't know, I mean, your brothers.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.880
-I just thought--
-What?

39:11.970 --> 39:15.007
You'd ask your brown friend for help
navigating the streets?

39:15.100 --> 39:18.172
What? No. I mean, not entirely.

39:19.230 --> 39:23.269
I mean, is that racist? I'm not racist.
Am I racist?

39:23.360 --> 39:26.682
Okay, don't go into your Clay-hole.
I'm not in the mood.

39:26.780 --> 39:31.353
Look, I know we haven't,
like, talked much these past months,

39:32.240 --> 39:34.151
and it felt like this whole thing
was gonna be over.

39:35.620 --> 39:37.190
But it's not over.

39:38.080 --> 39:41.789
Okay, you wanna find Justin.
How do you know Justin wants to be found?

39:42.540 --> 39:43.575
He reached out to Jess.

39:45.630 --> 39:47.416
-Rea|ly?
-Yeah. He sent her a postcard.

39:48.300 --> 39:52.088
She doesn't know that I know,
but if we find him, she'll have a witness.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.169
And she can report Bryce.

39:53.430 --> 39:56.251
And then what, we just deliver him
to Mrs. Baker so he can testify?

39:56.350 --> 40:00.138
-Yeah. I mean, that-- that's the goal.
-And is that what she wants?

40:01.100 --> 40:04.513
How many times did she ask us about Bryce?
About tape nine?

40:04.610 --> 40:06.976
She would've gone after Bryce
if lavwers hadn't talked her out of it.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.989
Yeah. Okay, I can talk
to my probation officer.

40:12.070 --> 40:15.369
He deals with homeless kids and runaways
and shit like that.

40:15.450 --> 40:17.862
-Yeah, see? I knew you'd have a way.
-Oh?

40:18.240 --> 40:19.070
I'm just saying.

40:22.540 --> 40:25.077
I don't recognize the face.
You try the city shelters?

40:26.040 --> 40:29.669
Been to five already.
Are you sure you haven't seen him?

40:29.960 --> 40:32.542
He might've been wearing,
like, a blue varsity jacket.

40:32.630 --> 40:38.216
-Um, he went to Liberty High School.
-Wait, jacket kid. Okay, yeah.

40:38.810 --> 40:40.675
He was just here a day or two,
couple weeks ago.

40:41.140 --> 40:43.517
Had an incident with one of the girls,
we asked him to leave.

40:44.270 --> 40:45.430
Can we-- Can we talk to her?

40:48.110 --> 40:48.929
You can try.

40:49.980 --> 40:53.564
He got a bed night one,
which never happens,

40:54.200 --> 40:59.024
but he went out and brought some coclq
skater asshole from a squat back with him.

40:59.540 --> 41:03.203
He started giving hassle to these
two friends of mine who are together,

41:03.290 --> 41:04.666
calling them faggots and shit.

41:05.420 --> 41:08.241
I got Lewis to bounce the skater kid
for being overage.

41:08.590 --> 41:13.459
We told Jacket he could stay,
but he was loyal and he took off.

41:14.130 --> 41:15.119
Haven't seen him since.

41:16.140 --> 41:20.588
Any idea where the kid skates? Or squats?

41:22.350 --> 41:24.136
[indistinct chattering]

41:29.690 --> 41:30.645
[Clay] Jesus.

41:32.990 --> 41:37.905
-People actually live here?
-Apparently. Come on.

41:40.080 --> 41:42.617
_Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of ours.

41:42.700 --> 41:43.746
Have you seen this guy?

41:44.500 --> 41:45.319
[woman] No.

41:45.410 --> 41:47.071
-All right. Thank you.
-Sorry.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.662
_Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of ours.

41:53.710 --> 41:56.679
Excuse me.
We're looking for a friend of mine.

41:57.090 --> 41:58.500
This guy. Have you seen him?

42:03.310 --> 42:06.382
Tony. We look like narcs.

42:07.060 --> 42:07.890
Okay.

42:08.270 --> 42:09.089
Can you help me?

42:13.570 --> 42:14.810
-Tony.
-What?

42:18.610 --> 42:20.771
-Can you spare some change?
-[Tony chuckles]

42:22.700 --> 42:25.908
Incentive. We need to offer incentive.
What do you have?

42:26.410 --> 42:28.162
[Tony] I fucking drove.
You don't have cash?

42:28.250 --> 42:31.993
No, I'll pay you back tomorrow,
with interest. Come on.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.795
[Clay] Uh...

42:40.390 --> 42:42.176
Have you ever seen this kid here before?

42:44.970 --> 42:45.800
Maybe.

42:47.890 --> 42:49.551
Will $10 help you remember?

42:50.730 --> 42:52.266
I think 20 would help me remember more.

42:59.910 --> 43:03.323
-There he is!
-Justin! Yo, Foley!

43:03.950 --> 43:05.156
Foley!

43:05.580 --> 43:07.616
-Hey! Where'd you get that jacket?
-What was that?

43:07.710 --> 43:09.575
You heard him, the jacket.
Where'd you get it?

43:09.870 --> 43:11.451
Goodwill. The fuck is it to you?

43:11.540 --> 43:14.168
-Don't fuck with me, man.
-Okay, Tiny.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.258
-[grunting]
'[guy] Whoa! Check it out!

43:19.630 --> 43:20.710
[clamoring]

43:21.680 --> 43:23.545
-Who the fuck do you think you are?
-Tony!

43:23.640 --> 43:25.881
Waste my time and I will fucking end you,
understand?

43:25.970 --> 43:27.267
-Tony, let go!
-Where is he?

43:27.350 --> 43:29.386
He was sparing change on BART
a couple weeks back.

43:29.730 --> 43:32.472
-When's the last time you saw him?
-Yesterday, in Chinatown.

43:34.650 --> 43:36.811
-[man] Damn!
-That's our friend that belongs to.

43:38.320 --> 43:40.311
-Tony, come on, let's go. Let's go.
-What the hell?

43:40.400 --> 43:41.776
-Where did that come from?
-Take the jacket.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.661
Wait. Wait, wait. I think that's him.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.742
-Jesus, that can't be him.
-Justin.

43:58.510 --> 44:00.000
Wait! Justin! God damn it!

44:01.300 --> 44:02.540
Fuck. Just--

44:05.050 --> 44:06.301
[Justin groans]

44:06.510 --> 44:07.636
You fucking kids!

44:08.770 --> 44:10.806
How many times do I have to tell you?

44:10.890 --> 44:14.348
Doing your drugs in my alley.
This is private property!

44:14.940 --> 44:16.567
I called the cops!

44:17.520 --> 44:19.568
Justin. Justin! Jessica wants you back.

44:20.320 --> 44:21.560
-Fuck you.
-No, she does.

44:21.650 --> 44:23.982
-I just talked to her yesterday.
-She hates me, okay?

44:24.070 --> 44:26.868
No, she doesn't.
She wants you to come back. [pants]

44:28.950 --> 44:30.247
[engine revs]

44:30.330 --> 44:31.536
[siren wails]

44:32.250 --> 44:35.242
I will leave both of you
if you don't get in my fucking car now!

44:35.790 --> 44:37.746
[siren blaring]

44:49.060 --> 44:50.630
[doorbell rings]

44:51.890 --> 44:53.187
[sighs]

44:56.060 --> 44:56.890
Good evening.

44:57.230 --> 45:01.064
Um, Mrs. Walker, I'm Kevin Porter
from Liberty High School.

45:02.070 --> 45:05.483
I know who you are.
I didn't realize you made house calls.

45:06.070 --> 45:07.947
I would like to talk to you
about your son,

45:08.280 --> 45:11.249
and his interaction with girls
at Liberty High School.

45:11.910 --> 45:13.070
My husband isn't home.

45:14.670 --> 45:15.489
Okay.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.080
Come in.

45:20.920 --> 45:23.969
-Can I get you something to drink?
-No, thank you.

45:25.220 --> 45:28.212
And I left a few messages at your house

45:28.300 --> 45:31.849
until your mom picked up
and told me to stop calling. So...

45:33.980 --> 45:36.016
Aanay, um...

45:37.310 --> 45:38.607
Look, I hope I find you.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.316
And I won't call you back again.

45:44.490 --> 45:48.403
I mean, I might call you back.
[stammers] I'll probably call you back.

45:49.870 --> 45:52.111
[sighs] Okay. Bye.

45:52.200 --> 45:54.953
In my experience,
a girl who doesn't call you back

45:55.080 --> 45:57.287
-is a girl who doesn't wanna talk to you.
-Rea|ly?

45:57.710 --> 45:59.587
You're gonna tell me
about your experience?

45:59.670 --> 46:02.958
Look, all I'm saying
is that Skye Miller is a piece of work.

46:03.050 --> 46:04.085
She's fucked up.

46:04.300 --> 46:05.119
She's--?

46:07.630 --> 46:10.542
I think you should stop talking,
like, for the foreseeable future.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.551
Good. You're alive.

46:15.270 --> 46:16.259
[Tony] Drink.

46:19.650 --> 46:21.936
-You're welcome.
-You'll feel much better after a meal.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.850
-And a shower.
-Fuck you.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.901
Your mom still live in the same place?

46:28.780 --> 46:32.272
-Shit, I can't go back there.
-What? Why?

46:33.580 --> 46:36.287
I took some money from her boyfriend
before I left.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.206
If he finds out I'm there, he'll kill me.

46:38.540 --> 46:39.916
So what the fuck do we do with him?

46:41.920 --> 46:44.297
[Jessica]
Friendship is a complicated thing...

46:47.800 --> 46:49.836
especially between girls.

46:50.300 --> 46:53.463
And it gets even more complicated
when there's a boy involved.

46:54.770 --> 46:56.089
But I can tell you one thing.

46:58.850 --> 47:01.057
Hannah's totally
Single White Female-ing you right now.

47:01.440 --> 47:04.011
I blame the boy more than I blame Hannah.

47:04.480 --> 47:06.027
Does that work if one of us is brown?

47:07.530 --> 47:10.192
-Just ignore her. That's what I do.
-[woman 1] Oh, shit.

47:11.320 --> 47:12.981
-Here she comes.
-Good luck with that.

47:13.700 --> 47:14.576
Bitches.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.781
-Hey.
-Hey.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.580
So...

47:25.380 --> 47:28.668
-You were pretty drunk the other night.
-Me and everyone else.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.543
Fucking Jeff Atkins, I seriously cannot
believe he would do that.

47:34.640 --> 47:37.302
Yeah, well,
maybe there's more to that story.

47:38.230 --> 47:39.049
What do you mean?

47:41.310 --> 47:42.436
Ijust...

47:44.230 --> 47:48.394
[sighs] Uh, listen, Jess, I, um...

47:50.450 --> 47:51.986
I saw something...

47:53.780 --> 47:56.829
-when you and Justin went into--
-Jesus, Hannah, seriously?

47:57.370 --> 48:01.079
First Alex and now Justin?
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

48:01.160 --> 48:03.958
I'm sorry that I'm making it work
with Justin and you couldn't.

48:04.380 --> 48:06.245
It's not my fault. Okay?

48:07.090 --> 48:09.797
-I'm--
-Jesus, some party.

48:12.720 --> 48:14.176
Yeah, some party.

48:14.470 --> 48:18.304
-It's so fucked up about Jeff.
-Yeah, it's all fucked up.

48:19.350 --> 48:22.387
-But, Jess and I had a good night, huh?
-Mm.

48:24.190 --> 48:27.182
-What are you--?
-Hannah, enough, all right?

48:27.270 --> 48:30.319
Can you just let me and Justin be happy?
Don't be a bitch.

48:31.150 --> 48:33.527
Yeah. Okay. Sorry.

48:35.910 --> 48:38.902
[Jessica] There are all different ways
boys mess with girls.

48:38.990 --> 48:44.201
And some of those ways,
well, we let them do it.

48:54.430 --> 48:55.749

48:56.930 --> 48:58.056
[Lainie] Clay.

48:59.430 --> 49:02.809
There's something we'd like to talk
to you about. Outside.

49:04.060 --> 49:05.015
Coming.

49:06.940 --> 49:07.759
Shit.

49:13.700 --> 49:14.735
Clay, um...

49:16.110 --> 49:19.864
We, uh, recognize that, um...

49:20.040 --> 49:26.411
most kids, many kids your age
in our area have cars.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.741
Even though public transportation
is excellent in this county.

49:28.840 --> 49:34.210
We also recognize that riding
on county highways may be safer from...

49:35.130 --> 49:36.176
a car.

49:37.390 --> 49:41.508
No way. Wait, this is mine?
[stammers] That's...

49:42.850 --> 49:45.432
-That doesn't make any sense.
-Agreed.

49:45.520 --> 49:49.479
We want to show you
that we trust you, Clay, to, uh...

49:49.560 --> 49:54.270
to do the right thing,
to be a grown-up, to make good choices,

49:54.360 --> 49:57.443
and to involve us in your life
when appropriate.

49:58.490 --> 50:01.982
Yes. Yes, 100 percent.
I'm-- I'm hearing you.

50:02.080 --> 50:05.208
Though, it's even easier to sneak
around in a Prius. They're silent.

50:05.290 --> 50:09.374
No more sneaking around.
No more secrets. I promise.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.415
Make a sound, we're both dead.

50:16.010 --> 50:19.468
[Cyrus] Yeah, we're gonna connect that
to the detonator.

50:19.550 --> 50:22.053
-Yeah, just go-- Just like-- There we go.
-Oh, shit.

50:22.140 --> 50:23.846
-Is that supposed to happen?
-Yeah. Yeah.

50:23.930 --> 50:25.727
[Jessica]
I think the kind of friends you have

50:25.810 --> 50:28.347
say a lot about the kind of person
you are.

50:28.480 --> 50:29.970
-[door buzzes]
-Oh, fuck, dude.

50:30.060 --> 50:31.812
-No, keep going. Shit. Shit.
-[door opens]

-Jesus. Get out!

50:37.490 --> 50:39.697
-Can I help?
-Get out!

50:39.990 --> 50:41.821
If Tyler tells me to go, then I'll go.

50:42.700 --> 50:44.748
Uh, uh, I, um...

50:45.160 --> 50:45.990
Now!

50:47.370 --> 50:48.997
Fine, assholes.

50:50.710 --> 50:51.950
Close the fucking door.

["Promise Not to Fall" playing]

51:02.140 --> 51:05.212

And Hannah, she was a true friend.

51:06.560 --> 51:07.766
Better than I deserve.

51:14.230 --> 51:17.438
You got your back against a wall

51:20.860 --> 51:24.944
I can see by the way
That you hold to it

51:27.450 --> 51:30.032
And everything is your fault

51:33.880 --> 51:37.919
When everything starts to hit
It's on you

'Cause you promised not to fall
