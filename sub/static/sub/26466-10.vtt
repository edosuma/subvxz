<i>Black Lightning...</i>

00:02.540 --> 00:04.140
- [beeping]
- [grunts softly]

00:04.150 --> 00:06.150
You're looking
at the king of Freeland.

00:06.230 --> 00:07.270
Good day, Mr. Green.

00:07.340 --> 00:08.490
The panel's decision
has been made,

00:08.560 --> 00:09.690
and that decision is final.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.150
- Some straight bull!
- Security!

00:11.220 --> 00:13.320
[Todd] You can take
that grant to hell.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.190
[Tobias] <i> I've been monitoring
you for a while now.</i>

00:15.270 --> 00:16.990
<i>When I heard you weren't
gonna get that grant,</i>

00:17.070 --> 00:18.740
<i>I figured it was
a good time to reach out.</i>

00:18.810 --> 00:21.670
Did you really just deposit
100 grand into my account?

00:21.740 --> 00:23.700
I wanted you to know
I put a value on your time.

00:23.710 --> 00:26.330
Whatever it is, I'm in.

00:26.340 --> 00:27.590
I better get my money's worth.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.250
Just tell me who
this person is you want found.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.680
[Tobias] Him.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.250
Giselle Cutter.
Assassin, tracker,

00:34.330 --> 00:36.680
<i>world-class martial artist,
mercenary for hire.</i>

00:36.760 --> 00:38.300
There is a killer
on my daughter's tail,

00:38.310 --> 00:40.520
hired by Tobias,
which means that she's...

00:40.590 --> 00:42.390
[Gambi] <i> She's after Khalil.</i>

00:43.090 --> 00:44.020
Are you good to go?

00:44.770 --> 00:46.010
Yeah.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.320
This is like finding a needle
in a haystack.

00:48.390 --> 00:49.730
[Black Lightning]
What about this last one?

00:49.800 --> 00:51.200
That's gotta be her. Let's go.

00:51.860 --> 00:53.030
[buzzing]

00:55.940 --> 00:57.200
They were definitely here.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.190
Just tell me the truth.

00:59.210 --> 01:00.330
<i>Is Jennifer dead?</i>

01:01.280 --> 01:02.250
I don't know.

- [Gambi over comms] <i> Not yet.</i>

01:27.050 --> 01:28.070
[Black Lightning]
<i>We were close behind them.</i>

01:28.140 --> 01:29.180
<i>How could they just disappear?</i>

01:29.260 --> 01:30.720
[Gambi] <i> They didn't disappear.</i>

01:30.800 --> 01:31.900
<i>They're out there
and we're gonna find them.</i>

01:31.980 --> 01:33.070
[Thunder] Look, I hate
to be Captain Obvious,

01:33.150 --> 01:34.410
but if they're still out there,

01:34.480 --> 01:37.320
we need to find them
before Cutter and Tobias do.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.650
[Gambi] <i> Just concentrate on your riding.
You're new to that bike.</i>

01:39.730 --> 01:41.570
Okay.

01:41.650 --> 01:43.000
Let me know
when you find something.

J, come on.

03:09.150 --> 03:10.830
Mmm-mmm, Khalil, do not do that.

03:10.910 --> 03:13.120
I just walked hella miles
on foot with you.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.300
Don't piss me off, I'm coming.

03:26.330 --> 03:27.640
[Jennifer exhales]

03:28.930 --> 03:30.520
Khalil, where the hell are we?

03:30.600 --> 03:31.560
[Khalil] Uh...

03:32.270 --> 03:33.230
[sighs]

03:34.440 --> 03:35.400
My apartment.

03:36.700 --> 03:37.950
[grunts]

03:44.850 --> 03:46.080
Did you draw all of these?

03:48.540 --> 03:50.000
Uh, yeah.

03:51.450 --> 03:52.790
Modern day Basquiat.

03:55.960 --> 03:57.540
This is kinda fly.

03:57.550 --> 03:59.340
[chuckles] Yeah, thanks.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.610
Yeah, you know,

04:01.610 --> 04:03.550
I needed someplace
where no one could find me,

04:03.630 --> 04:05.060
a place away from Tobias.

04:06.170 --> 04:09.630
Besides, I've always
liked trains.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.390
Yeah, ever since I was a kid,
I would watch

04:11.400 --> 04:12.440
Thomas the Tank Engine.

04:14.070 --> 04:15.900
Well, you probably
should've asked for some help,

04:15.980 --> 04:18.190
because interior design
is not your area.

04:18.260 --> 04:19.570
[both laughing]

04:19.649 --> 04:21.279
Okay, so you got jokes.

04:36.420 --> 04:37.800
[exhales deeply]

04:40.240 --> 04:41.590
Jen, where are you?

04:44.250 --> 04:45.850
[cell phone ringing]

04:46.460 --> 04:47.800
Yeah?

04:47.870 --> 04:50.260
You sound tired. Maybe
you should get some rest.

04:50.270 --> 04:52.100
I'm not resting
until our baby is home.

04:52.180 --> 04:54.260
Yeah, we're on it,
but they ditched the car

04:54.270 --> 04:56.140
and there's no bus stops nearby

04:56.220 --> 04:58.230
<i>or reports of other cars stolen.</i>

04:58.300 --> 05:00.030
So what do we do?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.850
Well, Gambi thinks they're hiding,
waiting for us exhaust our search.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.240
But where that is exactly,
we don't know.

05:05.820 --> 05:06.780
Khalil's.

05:07.620 --> 05:09.190
What do you mean, "Khalil's"?

05:09.270 --> 05:11.030
<i>I was hoping to find someone
Khalil might contact</i>

05:11.110 --> 05:12.570
who would convince him
to bring Jen back,

05:12.650 --> 05:13.960
so I went to see his dad.

05:14.030 --> 05:15.280
Wait, the felon?

05:15.350 --> 05:16.960
<i>I went to see his dad,
and he said</i>

05:17.040 --> 05:19.790
Khalil has his own place
somewhere Tobias can't find him.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.470
We know Jennifer
and Khalil were texting

05:21.540 --> 05:23.250
before they dumped
their cell phones.

05:23.330 --> 05:25.470
I'll get Khalil's number
and track the ping records.

05:25.550 --> 05:28.930
Eliminating Tobias-related locations
might help us find that hideaway.

05:29.960 --> 05:30.970
Good.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.810
Lynn, no more moves

05:32.890 --> 05:34.350
without backup, please.

05:37.630 --> 05:38.570
I hear you.

05:42.150 --> 05:44.950
So, uh, noodles in a cup
or ramen?

05:45.020 --> 05:46.360
Oh, I'm a ramen girl.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.370
Cool.

05:51.410 --> 05:54.450
Hey, you remember that time
I asked you to be my girl?

05:54.520 --> 05:56.990
Yeah, how could I forget?
[chuckles]

05:57.000 --> 05:59.790
You said that if anything
had happened to me,

05:59.860 --> 06:02.340
the thought of not being able to
ask me out really messed with you.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.080
Yeah, I remember.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.340
You was all shy and cute.

06:09.090 --> 06:10.060
Wait.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.020
- "Was"?
- Don't worry.

06:13.090 --> 06:15.520
You're still cute now that we
cut off those promoter dreads.

06:19.010 --> 06:19.940
Well, uh...

06:29.030 --> 06:30.080
you remember this?

06:37.450 --> 06:39.250
You know, I was thinking that...

06:41.360 --> 06:42.550
I'd like to give it back to you.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.220
Hey, look, um...

06:50.300 --> 06:54.220
Look, even if you say yes, it doesn't
mean you have to take me back,

06:54.300 --> 06:56.890
or we even have to be
boyfriend and girlfriend.

06:56.970 --> 06:59.520
It's just that, because you're
here right now, I thought...

07:01.840 --> 07:02.770
it belongs with you.

07:05.650 --> 07:07.740
[chuckles] You know what?
Sorry. Yeah, it's...

07:07.810 --> 07:09.030
I'd love to have it back.

07:27.000 --> 07:27.970
Hey.

07:35.180 --> 07:36.890
Hey. Hey.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.810
See?

07:40.260 --> 07:41.190
No glow.

07:42.760 --> 07:43.770
Just beautiful you.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.530
Khalil...

07:53.620 --> 07:54.620
[sighs]

07:57.700 --> 07:59.160
I can't.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.170
I can't do this.

08:02.210 --> 08:03.710
I'm sorry, but I'm not ready.

08:07.530 --> 08:12.760
I didn't leave home to lose my
virginity in a train car like this.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.890
- Yeah.
- I left home to keep you safe.

08:17.720 --> 08:19.380
To keep you alive.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.850
And I don't regret that
because you are alive.

08:22.420 --> 08:24.980
[crying]

08:25.060 --> 08:27.690
But I don't... I don't
want it to be like this.

08:28.990 --> 08:31.820
"We were on the run
in a train car."

08:33.490 --> 08:34.490
You know?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.820
I'm worried.

08:38.830 --> 08:40.500
I'm worried about
what's gonna happen to you,

08:40.570 --> 08:42.070
worried about
what's gonna happen to me.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.840
I'm worried about what
my family's thinking about me.

08:44.910 --> 08:48.210
Hey... it's okay.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.010
I will wait.

08:53.800 --> 08:54.800
Come on.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.080
What are you thinking about?

09:19.780 --> 09:21.120
I'm wishing
this was all a dream.

09:24.290 --> 09:25.250
Yeah, well, it ain't.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.510
Where are we going after we finally
get the heck up out of Freeland?

09:32.090 --> 09:33.780
California?

09:33.780 --> 09:35.960
Uh-uh, I'm not leaving Freeland
just to stay in the States.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.050
I want to go to Bahia.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.340
Oh, yeah, definitely Bahia.

09:38.420 --> 09:40.390
- Yeah? [Chuckles]
- Yeah.

09:40.470 --> 09:42.800
We also need to learn
some languages.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.520
I was thinking Portuguese.
What you think?

09:45.420 --> 09:46.440
Oh, French.

09:48.090 --> 09:49.900
Yeah, okay.
I'm not bad at French.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.190
[chuckles]

09:52.220 --> 09:53.450
Teach your little friend, too.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.410
[laughs]

10:03.660 --> 10:04.740
[Black Lightning]
All right, here she is.

10:04.750 --> 10:06.080
[Thunder] She's just
want answers.

10:07.740 --> 10:10.040
Did you guys manage
to come up with anything?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.090
[Gambi] Analyzing the cell
towers Khalil's been using,

10:12.170 --> 10:14.210
I've managed to eliminate
the most frequently

10:14.290 --> 10:16.090
visited places
that he wouldn't go now,

10:16.100 --> 10:18.250
like Club 100,
his mother's apartment.

10:18.260 --> 10:22.100
That leaves us with a two-mile
area of mostly abandoned factories.

10:22.180 --> 10:23.590
That's a lot to search,
Uncle Gambi.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.510
Any way we narrow
it down any further?

10:25.590 --> 10:28.110
Not without a live signal
from Khalil's cell phone.

10:28.180 --> 10:29.440
Okay. Okay, fine.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.320
So, Gambi and I will take these.

10:32.100 --> 10:33.760
You and Anissa take...

10:33.840 --> 10:36.020
No! Jeff, It'll be more efficient
if we search individually.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.110
- Absolutely not.
- It's too dangerous.

10:37.180 --> 10:38.450
I'll be fine.
Give me an area.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.030
We don't have time to chitchat.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.040
[gun cocks]

10:44.370 --> 10:46.710
Fine. We search individually.

10:48.280 --> 10:49.840
I'll divide the map
into four parts.

10:52.950 --> 10:53.970
It's on your phone.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.460
[motorcycle engine starts]

10:59.470 --> 11:00.560
Watch her.

11:01.310 --> 11:03.310
["The Pan Piper" playing]

11:07.810 --> 11:09.810
Hmm, spectacular, isn't it?

11:10.590 --> 11:11.820
It's not bad.

11:11.890 --> 11:13.500
"Not bad"?

11:13.500 --> 11:16.650
This man changed the landscape
of music at least three times.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.730
Americans, and most Negroes,

11:18.810 --> 11:21.120
don't respect the impact
jazz had on the culture.

11:21.190 --> 11:23.830
<i>The Birth of the Cool,</i>
Miles, Mingus,

11:23.910 --> 11:26.490
Art Blakey, Duke Ellington...
I could go on and on.

11:26.570 --> 11:28.660
That's black excellence.

11:28.670 --> 11:30.870
A man like yourself
should be able to relate.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.470
And why is that?

11:32.470 --> 11:36.540
Because jazz is underappreciated,
Todd, just like you.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.720
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Is it not true?

11:42.090 --> 11:43.850
Anything else, Mr. Whale?

11:43.930 --> 11:45.890
No. You can excuse yourself.

11:49.400 --> 11:50.440
How is it?

11:52.930 --> 11:54.600
It's toficken.

11:54.680 --> 11:57.190
I know you're one of them
transformed Negro vegans.

11:57.200 --> 11:58.860
[laughing]

11:58.940 --> 12:01.320
I made it my business
to know everything about you,

12:01.390 --> 12:03.860
like how you're
an encryption specialist

12:03.870 --> 12:06.360
who can understand the internal
workings of algorithms,

12:06.370 --> 12:08.030
that you can
read them well enough

12:08.040 --> 12:10.660
to have access
to whatever you want.

12:10.670 --> 12:12.880
- So that's why I'm here?
- Of course.

12:12.950 --> 12:16.010
I have a problem that requires
an intellectual musician.

12:21.410 --> 12:23.890
I have an instrument
that needs mastering.

12:23.970 --> 12:27.220
And based on what
I've read about you,

12:27.230 --> 12:29.340
I assume that we're working
outside the boundaries

12:29.420 --> 12:32.720
of all conventional
and legal activities.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.480
- Hmm.
- [cell phone vibrating]

12:37.890 --> 12:38.820
Answer it.

12:40.570 --> 12:42.530
Open them thick lips
and use your white voice.

12:46.150 --> 12:48.530
Hello, you've reached
the office of Tobias Whale.

12:48.610 --> 12:49.660
This is Todd speaking.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.290
Someone named Cutter.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.800
Yes, what can I help you with?

13:01.670 --> 13:03.300
[in normal voice] Are you sure
you want me to tell him that?

13:04.370 --> 13:07.140
Cutter no longer has eyes
on Khalil.

13:09.100 --> 13:10.230
Damn it!

13:11.710 --> 13:12.730
He's not happy.

13:15.350 --> 13:19.180
She wants to know the three most
visited locations of Khalil's implant.

13:23.020 --> 13:23.950
Can I ask why?

13:27.450 --> 13:29.290
Wait, what the hell does

13:29.360 --> 13:31.620
"walking backwards in your
own footsteps" even mean?

13:32.750 --> 13:35.000
Hello? Hello?

13:39.300 --> 13:42.510
Just how long has Cutter
been looking for this Khalil?

13:43.050 --> 13:44.180
Too damn long.

14:07.810 --> 14:08.740
Jen!

14:12.500 --> 14:14.210
Jen, it's Uncle Gambi!

14:14.830 --> 14:15.920
Are you in here?

14:18.840 --> 14:19.840
Jen!

14:41.840 --> 14:43.480
[breathing heavily]

14:43.550 --> 14:44.610
Jen!

15:14.060 --> 15:15.060
Jennifer?

15:19.640 --> 15:21.360
- [blows landing]
- [man grunting]

15:26.480 --> 15:27.780
[men laughing]

15:33.320 --> 15:34.290
[grunts]

15:38.580 --> 15:40.080
[men groaning]

15:51.010 --> 15:52.720
- [chimes]
- [gasps softly]

15:54.340 --> 15:55.810
Have you seen these two?

15:57.960 --> 15:58.980
[speaking Spanish]

16:12.860 --> 16:13.830
[in English] Thank you.

16:27.880 --> 16:28.840
Jennifer!

16:33.120 --> 16:34.140
Jennifer?

16:34.220 --> 16:35.180
[Khalil shushing]

16:36.810 --> 16:38.560
Jennifer, are you here?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.560
Please come home, baby.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.530
I know it may seem like running
is the right idea, but it isn't.

16:54.600 --> 16:59.110
There's no finish line for you or
Khalil if you just keep moving.

16:59.190 --> 17:00.540
You'll get hurt...

17:03.190 --> 17:04.210
or worse.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.369
Let us help you.

17:08.380 --> 17:11.130
Please come back.
We'll help you. I promise.

17:16.710 --> 17:18.720
We're not a family
without you, Jen.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.849
Home is not home.

17:22.930 --> 17:25.140
We just need you to come back.
No one's mad at you.

17:25.220 --> 17:27.569
We just want you home and safe.

17:30.010 --> 17:31.200
I love you, Jennifer.

17:35.600 --> 17:36.660
I love you.

17:46.550 --> 17:48.500
[Khalil] Whoa, whoa, whoa, J...

17:48.580 --> 17:51.220
J, listen to me,
we cannot go back.

17:51.290 --> 17:54.640
Do you think I wanna go back to
that Rikers Island of a home?

17:55.890 --> 17:58.850
I don't, but she's right.

17:59.790 --> 18:01.490
She's right.

18:01.490 --> 18:04.050
- We're not fooling anybody but ourselves.
- But we aren't fools.

18:04.060 --> 18:07.900
I mean, look how long
we've survived on our own.

18:07.980 --> 18:09.550
J, does that not count
for anything?

18:09.630 --> 18:13.940
Yes, it does, but I don't want to survive.
I want to live.

18:14.010 --> 18:17.410
I want to live a good life,
with you,

18:17.480 --> 18:19.230
but running is not
gonna help anything.

18:19.250 --> 18:22.030
Running is not gonna help us
solve any of our problems.

18:22.110 --> 18:23.610
J, you don't understand.

18:23.690 --> 18:26.080
If we go back,
Tobias will find us.

18:28.590 --> 18:29.880
He'll find me.

18:38.670 --> 18:39.670
[sighs]

18:43.510 --> 18:44.810
But he's not looking for you.

18:47.510 --> 18:48.480
[scoffs]

18:49.280 --> 18:50.400
I'm sorry, I...

18:53.140 --> 18:55.610
- J, I put you in this...
- No, don't start, Khalil. Don't start.

18:55.690 --> 18:58.700
I put you
in this crazy situation.

19:03.150 --> 19:04.370
It's time for you to go home.

19:18.770 --> 19:19.710
[Jennifer] Hi.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.630
- Jen?
- [Jefferson] Jen!

19:24.700 --> 19:26.840
- [laughter]
- [Jefferson] Oh!

19:34.470 --> 19:35.510
Hey, Mr. P.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.050
- Dad! Dad!
- Dad!

19:39.130 --> 19:40.350
- No.
- Dad, stop.

19:42.140 --> 19:43.560
You're lucky my family's here...

19:44.560 --> 19:45.940
'cause I would whoop your ass.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.840
[beeping]

20:21.190 --> 20:22.180
[Todd] Damn.

20:22.260 --> 20:24.140
Exactly.

20:24.210 --> 20:27.350
I've been able to access some information,
mainly about crooked politicians,

20:27.360 --> 20:29.850
corrupt agencies
of law enforcement, judges,

20:29.930 --> 20:32.350
and some very interesting
real estate purchases

20:32.430 --> 20:35.480
made 30 years ago under an
alias that doesn't exist.

20:35.560 --> 20:38.690
I managed to secure the property
except for one building,

20:38.700 --> 20:42.040
a clinic owned by
a pimpy-ass preacher. Hmph.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.710
That's as far as
I've been able to get with it,

20:43.780 --> 20:46.710
but I know it's bigger,
I know there's more.

20:46.790 --> 20:51.330
Uh, what would the ASA want with
property in the heart of the ghetto?

20:51.410 --> 20:53.340
That's what I need you
to find out.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.340
And most importantly, what does
all this have to do with metas?

20:58.960 --> 21:02.630
Well, well, well, look
what didn't drag Khalil in.

21:02.710 --> 21:04.390
I am not in the mood
for your jokes, little boy.

21:07.470 --> 21:08.900
[Tobias]
Give her what she needs.

21:08.970 --> 21:11.560
Whoa, whoa, okay. I don't
think that that's a good idea.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.860
When I looked up Khalil's
three most-visited locations,

21:13.940 --> 21:16.150
I did a little bit
of extra research,

21:16.220 --> 21:18.610
and Cutter has some, uh,
holes in her resume.

21:18.620 --> 21:20.570
I'll slit your throat,
you little bitch!

21:20.580 --> 21:21.660
Give her the list.

21:23.990 --> 21:28.580
Okay. Just...
trying to look out for you.

21:28.660 --> 21:32.870
I know, and I do greatly
appreciate the initiative, Todd,

21:32.950 --> 21:35.590
but you might want to tread lightly
around natural born killers.

21:36.950 --> 21:37.950
Cutter.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.420
- Do the job and do it fast.
- Yeah.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.170
Khalil being free means
his weak ass can snitch on me.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.010
And he's slowed me
down enough already.

21:46.090 --> 21:47.270
I got it.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.930
I need to get past
this firewall.

21:52.940 --> 21:55.820
I want all the information before
I move the way that I need to.

21:58.520 --> 21:59.700
[exhales]

22:25.960 --> 22:27.230
Little bitch.

22:34.970 --> 22:36.230
[Jefferson sighs]

22:42.070 --> 22:43.070
[Khalil sighs]

22:43.140 --> 22:46.740
Okay, look,
Mr. and Mrs. Pierce,

22:46.810 --> 22:50.170
I know I can't take back any
of the hurt that I've caused,

22:50.240 --> 22:54.740
but I am sorry, mostly for getting
Jennifer involved in all of this.

22:54.820 --> 22:56.250
And it's not even her fault.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.660
She was just trying
to help me out.

22:57.670 --> 23:00.010
That's not
completely true. I...

23:00.090 --> 23:01.720
I made a choice to run with him.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.180
We accept your apology, Khalil.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.930
And it's very admirable that
you would defend each other,

23:10.000 --> 23:11.590
but it doesn't change
the fact that Khalil

23:11.670 --> 23:13.560
is a danger to you
when he's with you.

23:13.630 --> 23:14.610
Because of Tobias?

23:14.680 --> 23:17.190
Yes, because of Tobias.

23:17.270 --> 23:20.560
He wants Khalil dead, period.

23:20.640 --> 23:26.110
And if that means he has to kill you
to make that happen, he will, period.

23:26.190 --> 23:30.210
Plus, Khalil knows too much to risk
Tobias getting his hands on him.

23:31.380 --> 23:33.100
Yeah.

23:33.100 --> 23:37.130
You mean about Jen having powers
or you being Black Lightning?

23:40.410 --> 23:41.720
- [Jennifer] Uh...
- She didn't tell me.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.050
I'm not stupid.

23:46.130 --> 23:48.600
I mean, she's electric, and
you and Thunder came after us.

23:52.590 --> 23:57.070
I would never do anything
to hurt any of you.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.610
[Jefferson
chuckles sarcastically]

23:58.690 --> 24:02.860
Yeah, that may be true... now.

24:02.940 --> 24:06.780
But what I meant is that Tobias knows
you can help put him behind bars.

24:09.910 --> 24:11.750
[sighs]

24:11.820 --> 24:14.070
Look, as far as I can see,
there's only one option.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.450
What?

24:15.460 --> 24:17.420
He has to turn himself in
to the authorities.

24:17.500 --> 24:20.750
Dad... No, please.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.590
Please. You care more about getting
Tobias than what happens to him?

24:23.670 --> 24:25.080
- [Lynn] Jennifer...
- Mom, it's the truth.

24:25.100 --> 24:26.720
- J, stop.
- What...

24:28.270 --> 24:32.130
Tobias is crazy, and I do
know too much about him.

24:32.210 --> 24:33.600
And he'll never
stop coming after me.

24:33.680 --> 24:37.230
And if he catches me,
hey, I'm a danger to you...

24:38.730 --> 24:39.730
To your family.

24:43.300 --> 24:44.240
Your father's right.

24:46.780 --> 24:48.120
I have to turn myself in.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.860
- [Inspector Henderson] He's a wanted murderer, Jeff.
- I know.

24:59.940 --> 25:02.870
And he tried to kill you.
He did kill you, technically.

25:02.940 --> 25:04.350
Yeah, I know that, too.

25:04.430 --> 25:06.320
And, Jeff, don't get me wrong,
I'm glad Jen is home,

25:06.400 --> 25:08.360
but I don't know why
you want me to help this kid.

25:08.370 --> 25:11.370
Okay, look, look. He made a lot
of bad choices, I know that.

25:11.450 --> 25:13.030
He knows it, too.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.740
But roll of the dice.

25:14.740 --> 25:17.380
If he doesn't get shot, all
of this turns out differently.

25:17.460 --> 25:19.380
A lot of people have
bad things happen to them,

25:19.460 --> 25:21.210
and they don't go to work
for a psychopath

25:21.290 --> 25:24.670
and run around shooting people
in the ass with poison darts.

25:24.680 --> 25:27.640
If we don't help,
Tobias will kill him.

25:27.720 --> 25:28.810
[sighs]

25:30.730 --> 25:31.770
Look, man...

25:33.470 --> 25:34.810
this is not easy for me,

25:36.090 --> 25:38.180
but he brought
Jennifer home safely.

25:38.260 --> 25:40.570
I may not owe it to him, but...

25:40.650 --> 25:44.530
I at least owe it to my daughter
to care about what happens to him.

25:47.990 --> 25:51.360
Well, no agency is gonna
protect him unless he testifies.

25:51.440 --> 25:54.070
Yeah, Khalil understands that.

25:54.090 --> 25:56.200
I can't believe you're trying
to save this kid's life

25:56.280 --> 25:57.420
after all he put you through.

25:57.500 --> 25:58.960
Yeah, I know man. I know.

25:59.590 --> 26:00.870
But...

26:00.950 --> 26:02.800
I guess I'm just glad
that he's...

26:04.500 --> 26:06.220
He's the person
that I thought he was.

26:08.010 --> 26:09.060
Sure you are.

26:11.090 --> 26:12.390
Always want to help people.

26:13.230 --> 26:14.430
Henderson?

26:14.440 --> 26:15.480
What?

26:16.900 --> 26:18.430
He wants to see
his mother first.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.610
[chuckles] The feds won't
make any stops, Jeff.

26:21.690 --> 26:23.110
This is gonna be hard enough
to pull off

26:23.190 --> 26:25.110
without a tour of Freeland
in the middle of it.

26:25.190 --> 26:28.110
Okay, then Black Lightning and
Thunder will arrange a meeting,

26:28.120 --> 26:29.650
and then we'll take care
of the hand off.

26:29.660 --> 26:32.460
You are still a vigilante
in the eyes of the law.

26:34.150 --> 26:35.330
[Jefferson exhales]

26:38.370 --> 26:42.130
All right, I'll make sure
the boy sees his momma. Damn.

26:42.210 --> 26:44.590
- All right. Docks, tonight?
- Yes.

26:46.750 --> 26:47.720
[scoffs]

26:49.220 --> 26:50.850
[exhaling]

26:53.960 --> 26:56.680
It looked like a tornado
went through here.

26:56.690 --> 26:59.230
There were a lot of big
feelings after you ran off.

27:00.130 --> 27:01.070
Yeah, I know.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.270
It wasn't your most mature move.

27:04.350 --> 27:05.860
Listen, we didn't have a choice.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.120
You always have a choice.

27:09.940 --> 27:11.040
Tobias wanted to kill him.

27:12.910 --> 27:14.740
You should've told me, Jen.
I would've helped him.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.170
Really? You weren't
saying that

27:16.240 --> 27:18.000
when Mom and Dad
had me on that tight leash.

27:18.080 --> 27:20.000
That's because they didn't want
anything bad to happen to you.

27:20.080 --> 27:21.420
And they were right.

27:21.500 --> 27:23.550
Your ass ended up being chased
by hired killers.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.720
Yeah, and I still had more fun
than I've been having at home.

27:31.720 --> 27:32.810
Come here.

27:36.260 --> 27:37.540
[sighs in relief]

27:41.340 --> 27:42.400
Did you have sex with him?

27:44.720 --> 27:47.520
How did you know
that was a conversation?

27:47.600 --> 27:52.540
Girl, two good-looking
teenagers on the run, in danger.

27:52.610 --> 27:55.320
I ain't gotta be Miss Cleo
to figure that out.

27:55.400 --> 27:56.910
[both laughing]

27:57.780 --> 28:00.040
So, did you?

28:00.910 --> 28:03.880
Part of me wanted to, but no.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.440
Hmm.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.290
At this point, it seems like
it'll never happen.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.640
Look, you did what was
right for you in the moment.

28:13.390 --> 28:15.730
And there ain't nothing wrong
with some self-love.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.230
- [chuckles]
- Okay?

28:18.300 --> 28:19.730
- Yeah.
- All right.

28:19.810 --> 28:21.180
Come here.

28:21.260 --> 28:22.560
[giggling]

28:22.570 --> 28:23.730
Yeah.

28:26.150 --> 28:29.190
[Tobias] Really? Hmm,
thank you for the heads-up.

28:29.260 --> 28:31.400
Before I let you go,
what's your favorite color?

28:31.410 --> 28:32.690
Blue?

28:32.770 --> 28:33.820
[laughs]

28:33.890 --> 28:36.000
Mine's, too. Okay.

28:38.490 --> 28:40.310
"Blue."

28:40.310 --> 28:43.040
There's no imagination in that.
It's like saying you like ice cream.

28:43.110 --> 28:44.160
I like ice cream.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.120
Of course you do.

28:46.200 --> 28:50.050
Have a blue .450 delivered
to my old friend ADA Montez.

28:50.130 --> 28:51.590
Make sure it can't be
traced back to me.

28:51.670 --> 28:53.710
Also, give this info to Cutter.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.170
Khalil is trying
to save his black ass

28:55.250 --> 28:57.970
by snitching on me and going
into witness protection.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.260
Well, do you know when and where
the feds are taking custody?

29:00.270 --> 29:01.480
It's on that paper.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.580
Hey.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.000
Yo, you should not be out here.

29:26.870 --> 29:27.960
Go.

29:28.040 --> 29:29.590
Okay. Why?

29:31.170 --> 29:32.710
Is Tobias Whale
in your backyard?

29:32.790 --> 29:33.720
That's not funny.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.720
- [sighs]
- Okay, you paranoid much?

29:38.790 --> 29:40.090
Look, after everything
we've been through,

29:40.170 --> 29:41.390
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

29:41.460 --> 29:42.470
Hey, come here.

29:46.230 --> 29:47.320
[Khalil chuckles]

29:50.180 --> 29:51.360
Khalil, I'm so sorry.

29:52.260 --> 29:53.570
For what?

29:53.650 --> 29:55.830
For everything.

29:55.900 --> 29:58.650
If you hadn't gotten shot
at the march, then...

29:58.660 --> 30:00.450
- Tobias wouldn't be chasing you...
- Stop.

30:01.980 --> 30:02.920
[exhales deeply]

30:04.170 --> 30:06.000
Look...

30:06.080 --> 30:09.420
Look, I know I said that I wouldn't
have gone that night without you,

30:10.370 --> 30:12.230
[sighs]

30:12.240 --> 30:14.680
But I was just trying to get the pain
out of me and on to someone else.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.390
I was going to the march.

30:18.870 --> 30:20.970
Being with you was just a bonus.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.650
None of this,
none of it is your fault.

30:29.270 --> 30:30.770
I really don't want you to go.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.030
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.240
Yo...

30:34.560 --> 30:36.520
this isn't the end.

30:36.530 --> 30:41.360
Look, I do the right thing, and
Tobias, he goes to jail forever.

30:41.370 --> 30:46.080
I get to come back, and who knows,
we can finish what we started, okay?

30:49.760 --> 30:50.750
I love you.

30:52.910 --> 30:55.050
And you're the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

31:08.310 --> 31:09.520
[sighs]

31:14.560 --> 31:16.580
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

31:20.780 --> 31:22.350
What?

31:22.360 --> 31:24.130
- Hey! Hey, stop!
- It's all right. Let her go. Let her go.

31:26.620 --> 31:28.790
- [crying]
- Hi, Momma.

31:28.870 --> 31:29.970
Oh, baby.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.220
[Inspector Henderson] We've
only got a couple of minutes.

31:34.750 --> 31:36.640
All this for my baby.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.890
- Really? Really?
- Hey. Hey, stop.

31:37.960 --> 31:38.940
Mom, it's okay.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
Hey,

31:44.340 --> 31:45.440
it's okay.

31:54.860 --> 31:57.370
I'm so sorry for everything.

31:59.580 --> 32:01.870
I didn't mean
to put you through this.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.540
All right. We gotta go.
Come on.

32:03.610 --> 32:05.010
[Khalil]
It's going to be okay.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.010
I'm gonna be back, Momma.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.380
- Momma, you gotta...
- Let's go.

32:08.390 --> 32:10.300
- Let's go.
- [sobbing] No. No.

32:24.630 --> 32:27.230
What, you've got to sign
for him like he's a package?

32:27.300 --> 32:29.240
Law enforcement
love their paper trail.

32:30.610 --> 32:32.030
[indistinct chatter
on police radio]

32:47.590 --> 32:49.220
Is he gonna be okay?

32:49.290 --> 32:51.390
Well, he's better with them
than with Tobias.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.740
Why are you stopping?
Run her over or go around.

33:16.750 --> 33:18.070
Really?

33:18.080 --> 33:19.910
Alert everyone.
I'm gonna check it out.

33:22.320 --> 33:24.130
Situation, 41.
Checking it out.

33:35.340 --> 33:36.310
Ma'am, are you okay?

33:41.420 --> 33:42.520
[agent grunts]

33:43.920 --> 33:46.110
Damn! Agent down! Agent down!

33:51.190 --> 33:54.020
[agent] Put your hands up!

33:54.100 --> 33:56.990
- Get on the ground!
- Hands! Let me see 'em!

33:58.540 --> 34:00.540
- [indistinct shouting]
- [guns cocking]

34:05.040 --> 34:06.500
[cell phone ringing]

34:08.300 --> 34:10.290
Hey, thanks for setting
this whole thing up...

34:10.370 --> 34:13.120
Something went wrong
with Khalil's transport.

34:13.139 --> 34:15.130
I'm about two minutes
from the caravan route.

34:15.139 --> 34:16.929
[sighs]
I'm on my way.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.969
Tell Anissa to reroute.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.139
Henderson says something's
gone wrong with the transport.

34:26.150 --> 34:27.150
You got it.

No need. Everybody's dead.

35:29.620 --> 35:30.790

35:30.860 --> 35:32.050
There's no sign of him.

[TV playing indistinctly]

35:55.390 --> 35:56.430
Yeah, okay.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.700
- [TV turns off]
- What?

36:18.820 --> 36:19.790
It's Khalil.

36:20.820 --> 36:21.790
Khalil what?

36:22.990 --> 36:24.170
He's been kidnapped.

36:28.410 --> 36:29.670
- I'm sorry.
- No.

36:30.780 --> 36:32.090
Ugh. No.

36:32.170 --> 36:34.590
No, no, no!

36:34.670 --> 36:37.210
No, I told you! I told you!

[Tobias laughing]

37:05.280 --> 37:07.750
Well, well, well.

37:10.130 --> 37:11.590
Leaving was all on me.

37:12.780 --> 37:14.120
My idea. My plan.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.840
You trying to get me
to go soft on the Pierce girl?

37:18.000 --> 37:19.380
I made her go.

37:19.460 --> 37:20.860
- Hmm.
- She had no idea what...

37:20.870 --> 37:23.720
She had plenty of chances
to get away, but she didn't.

37:23.790 --> 37:26.520
But once she left,
she couldn't go back.

37:29.170 --> 37:30.870
Her father's a hardass.

37:30.950 --> 37:33.390
It's practically a <i> Romeo</i>
<i>and Juliet</i> story, isn't it?

37:33.470 --> 37:36.810
Two young lovers,
desperate to be together.

37:36.890 --> 37:37.950
Nah, that's not it.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.870
I just wanted to get away
from your crazy ass.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.160
[chuckles]

37:45.240 --> 37:47.570
I got no beef
with the Pierce girl.

37:47.650 --> 37:52.370
She didn't get Syonide killed
or do a half-assed job

37:52.450 --> 37:55.340
and then run away without
facing the consequences. No.

37:55.420 --> 37:56.380
That was you.

37:57.650 --> 38:01.250
I wanted you to be great
like Alexander,

38:01.330 --> 38:03.850
but you've got the heart
of a stooped sharecropper,

38:03.930 --> 38:06.690
happy to spend the days
tending to master's land.

38:10.050 --> 38:12.730
We've got no time
for small dreams here, Khalil.

38:12.810 --> 38:15.140
So if you can't walk
with the giants,

38:15.220 --> 38:17.030
then you shall crawl
with the snakes!

Please.

Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:26.350 --> 39:28.970
It's gonna be all right, son.

Remember, the Lord
is your shepherd...

- You understand?

39:35.590 --> 39:38.600
No harm or evil can betake you.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.560
We ask you to come
by here right now, Lord,

39:40.640 --> 39:42.280
and put your arms around him.

39:43.690 --> 39:45.120
He's gonna keep you.

39:45.190 --> 39:46.860
Just hang on, son.

Ah... I'm... I'm sorry.

40:22.310 --> 40:25.370
- Uh, I did it!
- Did what?

40:25.440 --> 40:27.120
I broke the code!

firewall. Look.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.590
All right, now, look.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.130
So these are the pod kids.

40:40.510 --> 40:41.510
Wow.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.850
"The first shall be last
and the last shall be first."

40:47.920 --> 40:49.090
This is good.

40:49.170 --> 40:50.420
Yeah, but it only gets better.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.300
- "Better"?
- Yeah.

40:52.380 --> 40:55.180
See, remember we were
wondering why this clinic?

40:55.260 --> 40:57.860
Why the ASA was so interested
in it 30 years ago?

40:57.930 --> 40:59.970
- Hmm.
- It's where they were giving the original

41:00.050 --> 41:02.350
vaccinations to the kids
of Freeland.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.600
It's the first piece of
property the ASA bought.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.770
Rev. Holt took over it after they
stopped the first experiments.

41:07.850 --> 41:09.700

ain't making sense, Todd.

Super metas.

41:17.790 --> 41:19.880
There are four metas here,
all right?

41:19.960 --> 41:22.290
These are old
ASA experiment pods.

41:22.370 --> 41:23.370
[Tobias] Hmm.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.380
[Todd] These are their vitals.

41:25.460 --> 41:27.960
Now, the clinic, of course,
has been remodeled since then,

41:28.040 --> 41:32.100
so I can't pinpoint exactly
where they are, but they're here.

41:38.640 --> 41:39.650
So, what now?
