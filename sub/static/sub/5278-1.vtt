00:41.975 --> 00:44.466
<i>I remember the first time
I saw someone move</i>

00:44.544 --> 00:46.978
<i>like they were
from another planet.</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:48.810
<i>I couldn't keep my eyes away.</i>

00:50.750 --> 00:53.310
<i>When I was little my mom
took me to watch a jam session</i>

00:53.386 --> 00:54.648
in the neighborhood.

00:54.721 --> 00:57.656
<i>It started out small,
but word spread.</i>

00:57.724 --> 01:00.386
<i>Soon, some of the best dancers
around were showing up</i>

01:00.460 --> 01:03.759
<i>to compete in something
they eventually called, "The Streets."</i>

01:05.364 --> 01:09.165
<i>It became the hub, and
I got a front row seat to history.</i>

01:09.235 --> 01:13.569
<i>I wanted to glide and spin
and fly like they did.</i>

01:13.640 --> 01:16.108
<i>But it didn't come easy.</i>

01:16.176 --> 01:20.840
<i>My mom would tell me,
"Don't give up, just be you,</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:23.212
<i>'cause life's too short
to be anybody else."</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:26.976
<i>She was right.</i>

01:27.053 --> 01:30.250
<i>When I was 16,
my mom got sick.</i>

01:30.323 --> 01:32.223
<i>Within a couple of months,
she was gone.</i>

01:32.292 --> 01:34.624
<i>And everything changed...</i>

01:35.795 --> 01:37.194
<i>... including The Streets.</i>

02:08.794 --> 02:09.955
Shh. Shh.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.224
Suspects jammed it.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.236
- They went up the stairs.
- Sir, are you OK?

04:17.857 --> 04:20.291
Yo, the Four-one-oh
killed it again, man.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.519
That was sick, son.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.960
Thank you very much.
I'm a genius.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.396
If you do say so yourself.
Girl, get out of here.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.400
Get that mask off.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.766
Yo, we gonna get some
serious YouTube play, son.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.828
Come on, let's go.
We gotta get to the spot

04:32.905 --> 04:34.532
before everybody gets there.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.838
Oh, man, we struck gold
with this. Look at that, D.

04:37.910 --> 04:39.309
This is off the chain.

04:39.379 --> 04:41.711
Boards are gonna go crazy
over this one.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.045
- Yo, let's upload this stat. Not it.
- Not it.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.108
Aye. Why it gotta be me?

04:46.185 --> 04:49.450
- 'Cause you're the youngest.
- And, obviously, the slowest.

04:51.824 --> 04:54.987
Girl, stop slinging
that Spanish at me, Telemundo.

04:55.061 --> 04:57.825
- Aquí-quí-quí-quí-quí-quí-quí.
- Aquí-quí-hell!

04:57.897 --> 04:59.660
- Gotcha.
- Oh, Jesus, Tuck!

04:59.732 --> 05:02.963
Oh, man, wish you could see
the look on your faces.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.334
- Can the jokes, son.
- So what did you guys think?

05:05.405 --> 05:06.895
On the real?

05:06.973 --> 05:09.305
- We killed that!
- Oh!

05:09.375 --> 05:10.933
Oh, yes!

05:11.010 --> 05:12.136
Lucky, lucky!

05:12.211 --> 05:14.577
Streets ain't gonna be ready
for us this year.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.081
- Finally.
- Let me see that. Let me see that.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.517
- Give us my camera back. Give me here.
- Go, go, go, go.

05:27.026 --> 05:28.687
So what's up?
We going out tonight?

05:30.763 --> 05:33.129
I don't know. It's just...

05:33.199 --> 05:36.396
It's been a crazy time,
at home with Sarah and all.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.767
- Yeah, I heard that before.
- Yo, Tuck!

05:38.838 --> 05:40.533
Come on, man, we bouncing.

05:40.606 --> 05:42.631
- We gotta go. You're lagging.
- All right.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.768
- I'll see you at rehearsal.
- OK.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.836
<i>This video, posted
on the Internet just hours ago</i>

05:47.914 --> 05:49.609
was taken earlier today.

05:49.682 --> 05:53.709
<i>Depicts the most recent in
a wave of public disturbances</i>

05:53.786 --> 05:55.947
<i>plaguing the streets of Baltimore.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:58.923
<i>The notoriously elusive Four-one-oh</i>

05:58.991 --> 06:03.052
<i>has claimed responsibility
for this morning's attack</i>

06:03.129 --> 06:05.927
<i>that both defaced public property
and shut down</i>

06:05.998 --> 06:09.832
<i>the Charles Center Station
over security concerns.</i>

06:09.902 --> 06:12.996
<i>Police have been tracking
this troubling trend,</i>

06:13.072 --> 06:15.870
<i>and sources
close to the investigation...</i>

06:15.942 --> 06:18.103
- Not so fast, Andie. Get in here.
- Andie!

06:18.177 --> 06:20.839
We've got to talk.
I can't believe you.

06:20.913 --> 06:24.974
- Dinner was an hour ago.
- Sorry, Sarah, bus was late.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.541
I'm here, so just chill out.

06:26.619 --> 06:28.610
Baby, you go on upstairs
and go to bed.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.178
OK.

06:31.357 --> 06:33.655
I know where you been.
It's all over the news.

06:33.726 --> 06:36.559
So don't stand here
and lie to my face.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.654
You realize you could
have been arrested?

06:38.731 --> 06:40.892
It wasn't a big deal.
You have no idea.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.128
You've got to take
responsibility for your life.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.067
You can't follow
the Four-one-oh forever.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.073
Those people are criminals.
I'm putting my foot down.

06:48.141 --> 06:49.608
This has got to stop. Now.

06:49.675 --> 06:53.111
No! No, the Four-one-oh
is the only family I have left.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.079
Who are you to tell me
how to live my life?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.945
Your mother was my best friend!

06:57.016 --> 06:59.280
I told her that
I would be your guardian.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.411
I promised her that
I would take care of you

07:01.487 --> 07:03.455
so you wouldn't have
to leave your life here.

07:03.523 --> 07:04.956
But you won't let me.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.993
Instead, you skip school.
You're out all night.

07:08.060 --> 07:10.051
God only knows what you're doing.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.790
I can't do this.

07:11.864 --> 07:14.765
Your Aunt Alice and I
have been talking.

07:14.834 --> 07:18.497
- You can't live here anymore.
- You're sending me to Texas?

07:18.571 --> 07:21.768
Like I haven't lost enough already?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.433
You can't do this to me!

07:23.509 --> 07:26.637
Your mother never would've let you
get away with half the things I have.

07:26.712 --> 07:31.342
No, you have no idea
what my mother would have done.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.536
Felicia, where are you?

07:52.605 --> 07:54.505
I don't know what to do.
I'm going crazy.

07:54.574 --> 07:56.735
I'm done with her.
Please, I need a place to crash.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.972
I'm not staying there anymore.
Call me. I'm heading to the Dragon.

08:02.348 --> 08:04.213
What's poppin'?
I'm the man, DJ Sand.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.377
Tonight it's all about
the Benjamins, baby.

08:07.453 --> 08:09.614
We taking it to The Streets for green.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.283
You got money? No, you don't.
We gonna get it started.

08:12.358 --> 08:14.986
Brand new music. Listen to this one.

08:22.768 --> 08:25.896
Yo, Meazy. What's going on?

08:25.972 --> 08:28.065
- Yo, D. What it is.
- How are ya?

08:28.140 --> 08:30.938
- You out to do some damage tonight?
- You want to take my bag?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.136
Yes, yes, got it, got it.
It's crazy out there.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.077
- I know. It is.
- About to do your thing?

08:35.147 --> 08:38.116
- Oh, I will. You know.
- Go school them fools.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.024
Look who's all grown up now.

08:52.098 --> 08:54.464
Ty, what are you doing?
Oh, my God.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.866
- What's up, little one?
- Oh. I thought you were

08:56.936 --> 08:58.403
- in New York with Nora.
- I am.

08:58.471 --> 09:00.029
I came back to get
the rest of my stuff.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.437
- Guess what.
- What?

09:01.507 --> 09:03.975
- Me and Nora are going on tour.
- What?

09:04.043 --> 09:06.534
Oh, that is unreal.
You better remember me

09:06.612 --> 09:08.170
when you get all famous and stuff.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.374
Are you kidding me?
I remember you when you were

09:10.449 --> 09:13.441
running around in diapers.
You were a pain in my ass.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.077
That's really embarrassing.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.179
Seriously, what's going on
with you and Sarah?

09:17.256 --> 09:19.918
- She called you.
- No, she didn't call me.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.324
I came by to see you,
and she told me you took off.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.363
She's flipping out.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.193
Did she tell you
she's sending me away?

09:26.265 --> 09:28.028
She don't know what else
to do with you.

09:28.100 --> 09:29.533
She's trying to look out for you,

09:29.602 --> 09:31.832
like your mom and everyone else
looked out for me.

09:31.904 --> 09:34.202
- So, you're siding with her.
- No, I'm not.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.173
I don't even need to explain this.
I'm out.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.267
Whoa, whoa, come on. Chill out.

09:38.344 --> 09:41.438
Maybe you'll realize there are
some less dramatic options.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.106
Really, like what?

09:43.182 --> 09:45.412
- MSA.
- OK.

09:45.484 --> 09:48.044
- Maryland School of the Arts.
- Yeah, I know what it is.

09:48.120 --> 09:52.113
Are you crazy? Do I look like
some princess prima ballerina?

09:52.191 --> 09:55.456
Andie, what other options
do you have? Hmm?

09:57.296 --> 09:58.923
Let me break it down for you.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.366
Sarah will give you one more shot.

10:03.369 --> 10:05.633
But MSA's no joke.

10:05.705 --> 10:09.072
You gotta go to class, you can't
skip school, you got to study.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.268
No chance, no way.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.677
OK, fine, I'll battle you for it.
Right now.

10:14.747 --> 10:16.578
You win, I never saw you here tonight.

10:16.649 --> 10:19.140
I win, you get your ass back home
and you're at MSA

10:19.218 --> 10:20.651
first thing in the morning.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.813
If you're scared, say you're scared.

10:22.888 --> 10:25.083
I wouldn't want to battle me
if I was a girl.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.495
No smile?

10:30.563 --> 10:33.088
What, you scared? You down?

10:33.165 --> 10:35.395
Hold it, hold it.
Hold up, hold it.

10:35.468 --> 10:39.268
We got royalty in the house.
Tyler Gage is in the building.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.135
Oh, man.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.675
You know we gotta
do something special, right?

10:43.743 --> 10:45.301
Clear the dance floor. Back up!

10:49.548 --> 10:50.537
Brand new music.

10:51.951 --> 10:54.351
Oh, man,
are those trampolines?

10:55.121 --> 10:59.285
Use 'em or lose 'em.
Here we go. Cool, y'all.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.654
Dre, you want to get this?
I'll break my neck.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.629
No, I got it.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.393
Is she talking crazy?

11:07.466 --> 11:09.093
You still dance like a little girl?

11:24.650 --> 11:27.118
Let her know
what's good, Tyler.

11:55.581 --> 11:57.344
Come on, I want to show you.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.618
Oh, wow! He's killing you!

12:02.688 --> 12:04.019
Whoo!

12:18.304 --> 12:20.295
She punched it on you.
Whatcha gonna do?

12:21.640 --> 12:24.302
Did she stick you?
She stuck it on you.

12:43.529 --> 12:47.863
What you gonna do? He's not...

12:51.637 --> 12:55.038
Oh, no!
He's coming out of his clothes!

12:55.107 --> 12:57.598
It's over. It's over.

12:58.978 --> 13:03.039
Come on, y'all. It's all good, Andie.
Next time, baby.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.717
It's all right. You're good, ma.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.418
Oh. Hey.

13:15.494 --> 13:18.952
Don't sweat it. Everybody's
hatin' on you 'cause you're dope.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.605
Are you running off again?

13:30.676 --> 13:32.837
- No.
- No?

13:32.912 --> 13:35.574
- I'm just trying to look out for you.
- Yeah, whatever.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.583
Yeah, whatever.
Don't give me "whatever."

13:47.393 --> 13:49.623
Let's get you out of here.
I've got to get you home,

13:49.695 --> 13:51.526
plus we've got to sell Sarah
on the idea.

13:51.597 --> 13:55.260
- I thought she agreed.
- Just let me do the talking.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.632
No. I'm sending her
to Texas, that's final.

13:57.703 --> 13:59.671
She's already on probation at school.

13:59.738 --> 14:02.935
This is the one shot she needs
to take all that anger she's got

14:03.008 --> 14:04.703
and be able to put it into a structure.

14:04.777 --> 14:06.210
She's not going to school now.

14:06.278 --> 14:09.179
What makes you think
she's gonna go to this school?

14:15.988 --> 14:19.151
- Piece of cake.
- No way.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.659
- That's the thanks for saving your ass?
- She's down?

14:21.727 --> 14:24.355
Believe it or not, she thinks
I set a good example for you.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.057
- What?
- I don't know.

14:26.131 --> 14:28.463
My work here is done.
I'm going home.

14:29.668 --> 14:32.398
Now, all you have to do is get in.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.966
I thought you said
you took care of everything.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.942
I didn't say I'd get you in.
I said I'd get you an audition.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.241
So, go show 'em what you got, all right?

14:41.313 --> 14:43.577
Go hard, make me proud. Promise?

14:43.649 --> 14:46.550
- Promise.
- OK.

14:47.419 --> 14:49.546
Stay out of trouble, all right?

15:00.332 --> 15:04.268
Holy hell. I cannot believe
you're about to do this.

15:04.336 --> 15:09.296
Well, it is this or Texas,
so... take your pick.

15:11.977 --> 15:14.070
Don't blow it.
No pressure or anything, girl.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.376
- Wait a minute.
- Check that out.

15:16.448 --> 15:18.245
It can't be that bad, going here.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.717
- She's hot.
- Missy, shut up.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.380
- What?
- Just stop talking.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.754
- I guess.
- Look, go in there and kill it.

15:26.825 --> 15:29.020
We'll see you at rehearsal afterwards.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.654
- Come on, Missy.
- Good luck, D. Later.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.927
He was cute. You're mad
'cause he wasn't looking at you.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.401
He wasn't looking at you
or your chapped lips.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.133
Boring. It's a bunch of clones.

16:10.202 --> 16:13.433
Just because they do turns
with their feet and not on their heads?

16:13.505 --> 16:17.407
Very funny. Wake me up
when they're all done.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.276
I think we'd all agree that talent comes
from mastering technique.

16:21.347 --> 16:25.010
I was brought here because
I can turn amateurs into professionals.

16:27.319 --> 16:30.880
Nailed it.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.454
Music, please.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.093
- Thank you.
- Do you have your paperwork?

16:37.162 --> 16:38.561
Yep.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.927
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.846
Thank you, Miss, uh... West.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.288
- Mm-hmm.
- Well.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.423
Well, she was different.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.230
Kidding? That was the best dance
today. The girl's amazing.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.736
She's just a street dancer.

17:52.805 --> 17:56.866
Blake, I thought you could
turn anyone into a professional.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.113
Hold that.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.847
So what happened?

18:08.921 --> 18:11.788
- You guys, I choked.
- What do you mean?

18:11.857 --> 18:14.951
I tried to get it back
but I just freaked out.

18:15.027 --> 18:17.120
Sarah gonna have her
in Texas before we know it.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.824
- Hello?
- Yo? Who you talking to?

18:19.898 --> 18:23.197
- Oh, here he comes.
- I gotta take this real quick.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.498
Man, what y'all doing? Come on.

18:25.571 --> 18:27.903
- How'd she mess up?
- I hope she didn't.

18:27.973 --> 18:29.167
Yo, Rap.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.338
- Looks like I'm staying.
- Oh!

18:35.414 --> 18:37.382
- You are!
- Goodness, girl.

18:37.449 --> 18:40.043
I knew you would.
How were you not gonna make it?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.553
Yo, we need a family meeting.

18:42.621 --> 18:44.646
Yo, we got this gig
at the Dragon coming up,

18:44.723 --> 18:46.816
and we're not even close to being ready.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.621
The Four-one-oh is a unit.

18:48.694 --> 18:52.095
We're only as strong as
our weakest link. With the way

18:52.164 --> 18:54.826
our new members are slacking,
we have to step it up.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.461
Which means,
rehearsal every day, 4:00 p.m.

18:58.537 --> 19:03.031
No excuses, no being late,
and no cell phones.

19:03.108 --> 19:04.632
Are we clear?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.678
- Crystal.
- We're clear.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.844
You're in my seat.

20:16.748 --> 20:17.976
I'm kidding.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.450
This is my seat, but I'll give you
a pass for today.

20:22.921 --> 20:26.186
Nice. Nice. Nice shirt,
Napoleon Dynamite. Nice.

20:26.258 --> 20:28.954
You look fantastic today,
by the way. Nice hair.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.790
What's up?

20:30.862 --> 20:34.389
I'm Robert Alexander, III.
You can call me Moose.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.195
What's up. I'm Andie.

20:36.268 --> 20:37.963
It's like this. Give me your hand.

20:38.036 --> 20:40.766
You got to blow it up.
Blow it up, right. Blow it up.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.837
Go by like that. Aye! Yeah?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.311
It's mine, so... Shh.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.888
- You're not eating?
- You call this food?

21:03.962 --> 21:06.931
Tofu dogs are both
nutritious and delicious.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.626
This is good.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.166
Mmm.

21:13.238 --> 21:17.106
<i># Tastes like candy canes
at Christmas #</i>

21:18.710 --> 21:22.510
- What?
- You've got crap on your face.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.443
Oh. I knew we could
help each other out.

21:29.521 --> 21:31.318
Oh, what makes you think I need help?

21:31.390 --> 21:34.154
What makes you think I need...

21:34.226 --> 21:35.750
Trust me. I have what you need.

21:35.827 --> 21:39.888
I have the inside on everything.
Who's dating, who's hating.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.559
And who's hooking up.
What's up, Dan? What's up, Gator?

21:42.634 --> 21:44.795
- Who's that?
- See you guys later.

21:44.870 --> 21:47.304
That's the music room.
This is the art room

21:47.372 --> 21:49.806
where some of the greatest
Baltimore artists...

21:54.513 --> 21:56.344
I'm dead serious.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.907
Sorry.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.584
Oh!

22:05.190 --> 22:06.555
You OK?

22:07.659 --> 22:08.785
Hey.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.193
Thank you.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.459
We gotta stop meeting like this,
you know.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.258
It's Andie, right?

22:18.337 --> 22:21.204
I'm Chase. Welcome to MSA.
I'm glad you made it in.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.468
Well, here I am.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.339
You're an amazing little dancer.

22:25.410 --> 22:27.776
- What?
- You're an amazing little dancer.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.212
Little? Really?

22:30.282 --> 22:32.716
Well, you know, I wouldn't call
my dancing "little."

22:32.784 --> 22:35.651
- I definitely was not trying to say...
- Andie!

22:35.721 --> 22:38.315
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

22:40.225 --> 22:41.988
- Chase.
- Hey.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.426
- How you doing?
- Great. You guys are friends?

22:45.931 --> 22:48.798
- Yeah, we go way back.
- Good.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.961
We're actually late
for a little something, so...

22:52.037 --> 22:53.732
We are?

22:53.805 --> 22:55.773
- Yeah.
- What?

22:55.841 --> 22:58.207
- That thing you told me?
- I didn't tell you anything.

22:58.276 --> 23:00.608
Yes, you did. We're gonna go.

23:00.679 --> 23:04.171
- Remember that thing?
- What?

23:04.249 --> 23:07.309
- That thing you wanted to do?
- What are you talking about?

23:07.386 --> 23:10.184
I can't believe
you know Chase Collins.

23:10.255 --> 23:12.746
That's extremely vital
information to withhold.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.349
- I don't know him.
- He's Mr. Popular.

23:15.427 --> 23:18.157
Like a legacy. His parents,
like, founded this school.

23:18.230 --> 23:20.164
And his brother is legendary.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.996
- Dr. Collins is his brother?
- Yeah.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.401
He used to go here, then moved to
London to dance with the Royal Ballet.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.462
Oh, my God. That's him?

23:28.540 --> 23:31.407
Yeah. It's hard to believe,
right, with all those feathers.

23:31.476 --> 23:33.137
So why'd he come back?

23:34.212 --> 23:35.679
Good question.

23:35.747 --> 23:39.945
Sources say he has some sweet deal
to make MSA the next Juilliard.

23:40.018 --> 23:42.543
Which he's been trying to do.
Maybe he's just burned out.

23:42.621 --> 23:43.986
One thing's for sure.

23:44.055 --> 23:46.956
There's a lot of changes
going down that nobody likes.

23:47.025 --> 23:48.458
Here.

23:49.694 --> 23:52.356
Anyway, the Collins
are like flippin' MSA royalty.

23:52.431 --> 23:54.922
Chase, he's a ladies' man.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.491
- He's a player?
- Like an all-star.

23:57.569 --> 24:01.562
He's only recently taken the jersey
out of retirement. So be warned.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.936
Oh, and that's Cyborg Sophie.

24:06.011 --> 24:08.878
She's an MSA machine
and Collins' crowning achievement.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.711
She's a triple threat.
She acts, sings and dances.

24:11.783 --> 24:14.217
She won every competition out there.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.777
But she just lost
the biggest battle of them all,

24:16.855 --> 24:18.982
the one for Chase's heart.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.787
<i>It's like I've landed
in an episode of The Hills.</i>

24:21.860 --> 24:25.387
He broke up with her a few weeks ago,
but they'll end up together.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.024
Just in time
for the season finale, huh?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.831
See? I knew you'd come around.

24:32.003 --> 24:34.801
Hello, everyone.
I'm Director Collins.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.966
I hope you've all stretched
this morning,

24:37.042 --> 24:39.704
'cause we have
a lot of work to do today.

24:39.778 --> 24:42.679
I'm sure that everyone
has heard of our plans

24:42.747 --> 24:46.444
to move MSA into a new
state-of-the-art facility.

24:46.518 --> 24:50.045
Well, to encourage the donors,
we're throwing a fundraiser,

24:50.121 --> 24:51.611
where you will perform

24:51.690 --> 24:54.625
to demonstrate what
a good investment you are.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.217
It should be a wonderful event.

24:56.294 --> 25:00.025
You are all required to participate
in one way or another.

25:00.098 --> 25:03.090
So, let's begin with some improv,
shall we?

25:03.168 --> 25:05.534
Jimmy, you're up.

25:16.081 --> 25:19.312
You're late. Not being on time
won't fly in the real world.

25:19.384 --> 25:21.045
Already with that stuff, Blake?

25:21.119 --> 25:25.351
- That's Director Collins.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

25:26.358 --> 25:29.122
Chase, show us what you got.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.485
Not great. Could do better.

26:04.429 --> 26:06.829
OK. Andie, you're up.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.838
Are you serious?

26:16.908 --> 26:19.240
Listen and interpret.

26:26.851 --> 26:30.048
Andie. Andie!
You're all over the place.

26:30.121 --> 26:33.090
Again, from the top,
listen and interpret.

26:51.776 --> 26:56.076
Stop. Stop! Can I have
a word with you in private?

26:56.147 --> 26:58.308
And bring your bags.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.155
You understand you've been
given an opportunity

27:04.155 --> 27:04.780
You understand you've been
given an opportunity

27:04.856 --> 27:06.619
that others couldn't even dream of?

27:06.691 --> 27:08.921
I put my name on the line for you,

27:08.994 --> 27:11.292
and I'm beginning to wonder
if I made a mistake.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.490
You clearly have
some catching up to do.

27:13.565 --> 27:17.262
Starting tomorrow I'm assigning you
to attend after school sessions with me.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.565
Well, I can't. I gotta be somewhere.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.435
Consider this an opportunity.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.104
What?

27:24.175 --> 27:27.702
Made a mistake
and kissed a snake

27:27.779 --> 27:31.579
How many doctors did it take?

27:31.650 --> 27:35.142
One, two, three, four

27:35.220 --> 27:40.453
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten

27:40.525 --> 27:42.789
Just breathe.
First day's always the worst.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.224
- I was just...
- That's OK.

27:45.296 --> 27:47.526
I come out to the front steps
and meditate, too.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.260
What? It's not meditating.

27:49.334 --> 27:50.494
It's just, you know,

27:50.568 --> 27:52.763
you had some pretty
serious balls today in class.

27:52.837 --> 27:54.998
- I was impressed.
- Oh, gee, thanks.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.473
- You're welcome.
- So what's your deal?

27:57.542 --> 27:58.975
Boy bands making a comeback?

27:59.044 --> 28:01.239
Yeah. They have a course on it here.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.876
I'm getting straight A's.

28:03.948 --> 28:05.939
That wouldn't surprise me.

28:06.985 --> 28:11.422
Look, it's been interesting
bonding with you, but I'm late.

28:11.489 --> 28:14.424
- Late for what?
- Just this rehearsal thing.

28:14.492 --> 28:18.485
- Rehearsal for what?
- Rehearsal with some friends.

28:18.563 --> 28:21.293
- Like a crew?
- What would you know about that?

28:21.366 --> 28:23.891
Knew it. Saw you at the Dragon.
You're with Four-one-oh.

28:23.968 --> 28:26.368
- I don't know what...
- I've always wanted to compete,

28:26.438 --> 28:28.838
I've just never had an in.
Can you hook me up?

28:28.907 --> 28:32.308
Hey, Chase, we're working
on the routine for the fundraiser.

28:32.377 --> 28:33.401
Are you coming?

28:33.478 --> 28:35.207
Yeah, I'll be right there.

28:38.016 --> 28:40.211
Sophie, I'll meet you in the rehearsal.

28:40.285 --> 28:41.547
OK.

28:43.788 --> 28:45.119
Look.

28:45.957 --> 28:49.654
The Streets is about where you're from.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.753
It's not some school talent show.

28:51.830 --> 28:54.993
There's no spring floors.
There's no spotlights.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.057
You use what you got and...

28:57.669 --> 28:59.159
What makes you think you got it?

28:59.237 --> 29:01.705
Weren't you late for something, Andie?

29:01.773 --> 29:03.900
All dressed in yella

29:03.975 --> 29:05.533
Went upstairs to kiss a fella

29:05.610 --> 29:07.578
One, two, three, four

29:07.645 --> 29:09.977
five, six, seven, eight,

29:10.048 --> 29:11.845
- Bye, Andie West.
- nine, ten, 11, 12,

29:11.916 --> 29:14.384
13, 14, 15, 16...

29:14.452 --> 29:16.716
...five, six, seven, eight.
Again.

29:16.788 --> 29:21.191
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

29:21.259 --> 29:25.286
One, two, three, four.
Whoa, wait, oh, wait.

29:25.363 --> 29:28.457
You did that different.
Can you do that from three four?

29:28.533 --> 29:29.932
Let me go figure this out.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.992
Y'all just chill here for a second.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.470
Where have you been?
I been texting you all day.

29:34.539 --> 29:37.906
I know, I'm sorry.
The school thing is crazy.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.534
Will you cover for me with Tuck?

29:39.611 --> 29:41.772
Don't I always cover for you? Yeah.

29:41.846 --> 29:43.814
Yo, D, let me holler at you.

29:47.252 --> 29:48.719
Yo, where you been?

29:48.787 --> 29:50.379
I had to take care of some stuff.

29:50.455 --> 29:53.652
- Yeah, with who?
- Charlie.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.626
Sarah asked me to take care of him
while she was at work.

29:56.694 --> 29:58.662
You still coming over tonight or what?

29:58.730 --> 30:02.257
Yeah, yeah. Gonna take care
of some stuff and I'll be there.

30:02.333 --> 30:04.096
All right.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.304
Yo! Start from the beginning.

30:07.372 --> 30:09.670
OK, now, point your toe.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.371
You see, you're sickling.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.844
There should be no curve
disrupting the line from the knee

30:19.918 --> 30:22.910
all the way down to the tip of your toe.

30:23.955 --> 30:25.479
- Ow! Ow!
- There you go. That's it.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.787
- There. That's it.
- Ow. Pointing hurts.

30:27.859 --> 30:29.121
Yeah, it's supposed to.

30:48.079 --> 30:51.071
Pull in your stomach.
Flatten, flatten, flatten.

30:51.149 --> 30:53.310
Now, tuck your butt.

30:53.384 --> 30:55.579
Keep this leg turned out.

30:55.653 --> 30:57.712
Turned out. Turned out!

30:57.789 --> 30:59.120
Oh, my God.

31:10.401 --> 31:14.132
<i>Balancé, balancé,
chassé, pas de bourrée,</i>

31:14.205 --> 31:17.072
turn, turn, down, finish.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.540
Turn, turn, spot, spot!

31:26.618 --> 31:28.745
Ready, and feet in front, feet back,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.617
feet front, feet back. Come on.

31:30.688 --> 31:35.091
And back and back
and back and back

31:35.159 --> 31:37.559
and back and back and back
and back and back and back and back.

31:37.629 --> 31:40.189
Good! That's it.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.698
Andie? There's dinner down here.

32:02.053 --> 32:05.784
<i>Yo, where D at?</i>

32:07.158 --> 32:10.958
She left me a message.
Sarah got her on lockdown again.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.594
Guess she's missing out... again.

32:16.634 --> 32:18.397
Guess so.

32:18.469 --> 32:21.802
And then I was like,
"Damn, your breath stinks."

32:21.873 --> 32:23.272
Why would you say that?

32:23.341 --> 32:26.174
- I thought it would be cool.
- Well, it wasn't.

32:28.913 --> 32:32.280
- It's my mom.
- Oh, my gosh.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.614
- What?
- That is not your ringtone.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.349
Why? It's the coolest thing ever.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.551
OK, fine. Listen.

32:46.898 --> 32:50.459
Here we go.
Watch me, watch me, watch.

33:33.311 --> 33:34.938
I don't even know him.

33:35.013 --> 33:38.642
You were so sick.
I had no idea you could dance.

33:38.716 --> 33:40.650
- Whatever.
- What are you talking about?

33:40.718 --> 33:42.447
Why don't you dance here?

33:42.520 --> 33:44.647
I can freestyle all right. Right?

33:44.722 --> 33:47.122
But I didn't get in here for dance.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.819
I didn't think I could do choreography.

33:49.894 --> 33:51.828
But now I'm all about lighting design.

34:04.542 --> 34:08.205
The end's not working.

34:08.279 --> 34:10.543
Mixing those moves just feels wrong.

34:10.614 --> 34:13.413
- Come on, man.
- Let me show you something.

34:13.484 --> 34:17.045
If you put this here into a canon,
and then swing through to fifth,

34:17.121 --> 34:20.454
then bring it down. Step, step, stag.

34:20.525 --> 34:24.552
<i>Soutenu, double tour to the knee.</i>

34:24.629 --> 34:26.529
Nice, Jimmy.

34:31.768 --> 34:34.237
Looks like someone's in a good mood.

34:34.304 --> 34:37.239
Must be hard living in the shadow
of a legend, huh?

34:37.308 --> 34:39.572
Wow, that coming
from the MSA charity case?

34:41.779 --> 34:46.306
I was kidding. You're right,
he's an ass. I'm out of here.

35:01.766 --> 35:05.600
Look, I never called you an ass.

35:06.838 --> 35:08.999
She just said that for dramatic effect.

35:17.348 --> 35:18.906
If you're trying to win her over,

35:18.983 --> 35:20.951
you probably shouldn't
treat her like that.

35:21.018 --> 35:24.112
I'm not trying to win her over.

35:27.892 --> 35:29.257
Then don't lead her on.

35:34.332 --> 35:36.357
Andie.

35:36.434 --> 35:37.924
- Hey.
- What's going on?

35:38.002 --> 35:40.800
I wanted to apologize
for earlier today.

35:40.872 --> 35:42.305
It wasn't anything personal.

35:42.373 --> 35:45.934
I had a really rough day
and I was joking.

35:46.010 --> 35:49.104
Oh, please.
It's not like I sit up at night

35:49.180 --> 35:51.944
and think about what
you do or don't say to me,

35:52.016 --> 35:54.177
but thanks.

35:54.252 --> 35:56.277
- I feel better now.
- Let me give you a ride.

35:56.354 --> 35:58.015
Make it up to you.

36:00.558 --> 36:02.185
I can just take the bus.

36:02.260 --> 36:05.229
No, come on. My car's
gotta smell better than the bus.

36:32.623 --> 36:35.319
- There she is.
- She come when we're done.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.190
She missed
the whole rehearsal.

36:37.261 --> 36:38.455
Hey, guys.

36:38.529 --> 36:42.192
Miss thing girl. Where you been at?
What's the deal?

36:42.266 --> 36:44.393
Thank you for gracing us
with your presence.

36:44.468 --> 36:48.302
- Rehearsal's done.
- Hey, hey, come on.

36:48.372 --> 36:51.364
I got here as soon as I could.
You know what's been going on.

36:51.442 --> 36:54.377
No, I don't, but I'll tell you
what's been going on.

36:54.445 --> 36:57.881
Everybody's been asking,
"Have you talked to D? Where's D at?"

36:57.949 --> 37:00.816
I'm looking like an ass
making stuff up for you,

37:00.885 --> 37:03.183
so you can go dance around
your fancy new school.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.688
- What is your problem?
- What's going on here?

37:05.756 --> 37:08.088
- Ask her.
- What was that?

37:08.726 --> 37:10.660
I said, "Ask her."

37:10.728 --> 37:12.719
D, you gotta tell me something?

37:14.498 --> 37:18.025
Yeah, the reason I've been late
and haven't been around much

37:18.102 --> 37:19.763
is because...

37:22.139 --> 37:24.869
...l've been going to school at MSA.

37:24.942 --> 37:27.672
So you've been lying to me
and the crew for what?

37:27.745 --> 37:30.145
- Those ballet boys?
- I don't have a choice.

37:30.214 --> 37:33.411
No, that's messed up, D. We're family.

37:33.484 --> 37:36.112
I thought you said
you understood that.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.712
The Four-one-oh
don't come second to nobody.

37:38.789 --> 37:41.952
- You out.
- No, please, Tuck, come on.

37:42.026 --> 37:44.688
It's just been a crazy time.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.094
It's always been a crazy time with you.

37:47.164 --> 37:48.631
Yo, let's go.

38:17.862 --> 38:20.057
- Oh!
- Hey, watch yourself, huh?

38:21.632 --> 38:23.224
God...

38:26.370 --> 38:27.496
Morning, sunshine.

38:28.773 --> 38:30.968
The good times just keep on
coming, don't they?

38:31.042 --> 38:32.441
Ouch.

38:33.911 --> 38:35.674
- What got into you today?
- What?

38:35.746 --> 38:38.772
As opposed to my winning charm
every other day?

38:38.849 --> 38:40.783
Fair enough. Two points to the new girl.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.322
You want to talk about it?

38:53.864 --> 38:56.765
- I got kicked out of my crew.
- What for?

38:56.834 --> 38:59.325
For being here.

38:59.403 --> 39:02.804
I can't believe I messed this up.

39:02.873 --> 39:06.206
They're the ones that messed up.
They lost an amazing dancer.

39:07.878 --> 39:09.505
You should just start your own crew.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.844
No, you can't just start your own crew.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.942
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

39:16.387 --> 39:19.879
- Besides, who would be in it? Me and...
- Me.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.554
- Us.
- OK. We'll just start our own crew.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.223
What else you gonna do?

39:27.298 --> 39:30.062
Nobody here is gonna step out
of their perfect world.

39:30.134 --> 39:33.228
Not the Sophie Donovans, but
there's a lot going on under the radar.

39:33.304 --> 39:34.965
Really?

39:35.039 --> 39:37.064
There's this guy we call Hair.

39:37.141 --> 39:39.609
He's this half hippy,
half rhythmic rebel

39:39.677 --> 39:41.508
and he makes the sickest beats.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.308
Teachers don't know
what to do with him.

39:43.381 --> 39:47.181
Can't put him in a class, gets bored,
makes up his own steps.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.686
There's Kido. She's this
foreign exchange student

39:51.756 --> 39:53.724
obsessed with old-school
American hip hop.

39:53.791 --> 39:56.885
And, trust me, she doesn't need
English to speak our language.

40:01.599 --> 40:05.160
Fly's the quiet one,
but not when the music's on.

40:05.236 --> 40:09.036
She's too tall to partner, but when
you're that good, who needs a partner?

40:13.277 --> 40:16.303
Which brings us to Monster,
our resident stunt double.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.314
He flips, he slides, he falls.

40:18.382 --> 40:21.351
Whatever you need to make
an action sequence work onstage.

40:22.186 --> 40:23.881
But he never gets the spotlight.

40:30.261 --> 40:33.355
Most know my boy, Cable,
as the video yearbook editor.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.762
But little do they know,

40:34.832 --> 40:37.767
he's one of the best freestyle dancers
I've seen in my life.

40:41.605 --> 40:44.768
And, finally, Smiles.
Nicest guy you'll ever meet.

40:44.842 --> 40:46.901
Dopest dancer on the dance floor.

40:46.977 --> 40:49.445
Unfortunately, MSA only sees
what it wants to see.

40:53.751 --> 40:55.946
- Don't forget Moose.
- Moose?

40:56.020 --> 40:59.319
- Yeah, trust me on this one.
- Come on.

40:59.390 --> 41:02.018
But what makes you
think they'll do it?

41:02.092 --> 41:03.855
They all have nothing to lose.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.418
No!

41:05.496 --> 41:07.361
You guys, listen up. Check it out.

41:08.732 --> 41:11.360
Now, I know each and every one
of you knows what it's like

41:11.435 --> 41:15.235
to be forced to conform
and become an MSA robot, right?

41:15.306 --> 41:17.774
Yeah, they wanted me to cut my hair.

41:17.842 --> 41:18.968
Yeah, and fix my teeth.

41:19.043 --> 41:20.806
- I like your teeth.
- Thank you.

41:20.878 --> 41:22.539
I like your accent.

41:22.613 --> 41:24.012
What kind of accent?

41:24.081 --> 41:26.106
The accent you have.
You have an accent.

41:26.183 --> 41:27.946
- I have no accent.
- It's really strong.

41:28.018 --> 41:29.349
That's my point.

41:29.420 --> 41:32.184
I know that each one of you guys
has an amazing talent

41:32.256 --> 41:34.281
that this school doesn't know
what to do with.

41:34.358 --> 41:36.952
I think it's time we do
something with that talent.

41:37.027 --> 41:38.688
- Like what?
- Like form a crew

41:38.762 --> 41:40.161
and compete at The Streets.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.495
- No, no!
- I heard it's dangerous.

41:42.566 --> 41:45.433
Forget about what you heard.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.836
The Streets is about the best dance crew
showing off what they got.

41:48.906 --> 41:51.306
- We don't stand a chance.
- What are you talking about?

41:51.375 --> 41:53.366
I've seen you do stunts
in the school play.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.105
There's a reason
they call you Monster.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.168
Like this?

41:57.381 --> 41:59.849
- That was hot.
- That's crazy.

41:59.917 --> 42:02.715
Kido, you went crazy at the showcase
after-party last year.

42:02.786 --> 42:04.219
Oh, that was fun.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.920
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, hey.

42:07.992 --> 42:10.426
- Get it, Kido.
- She won't... She won't stop.

42:10.494 --> 42:12.985
She won't stop, she won't.
You need to stop.

42:13.063 --> 42:15.156
- So when is it?
- That's the thing.

42:15.232 --> 42:18.690
Nobody knows when or where
until a text message of the night of.

42:18.769 --> 42:20.828
So we have got to be ready.

42:20.905 --> 42:24.170
Sounds good. Director Collins'd
never let us rehearse here.

42:24.241 --> 42:27.540
- No way.
- Who said Director Collins has to know?

42:27.611 --> 42:29.875
- Wow.
- He's got the keys.

42:29.947 --> 42:31.244
Borrowed and copied.

42:31.315 --> 42:34.250
MSA after hours. I like it.

44:38.075 --> 44:40.942
Yeah! Oh, man, we did good.

44:44.615 --> 44:47.209
What do you say we go
and check out our competition?

44:48.886 --> 44:51.218
All right,
let's get it started right now!

44:51.288 --> 44:54.689
Whoo! Oh, man! Put your hands up.

44:56.093 --> 44:57.958
Put your hands up. I see you, baby!

44:58.028 --> 45:00.053
Want your mama again?

45:00.130 --> 45:02.564
Hey, yo, Leesh.
Leesh, look, look, look, look.

45:02.633 --> 45:03.998
- Andie's here.
- Where?

45:04.068 --> 45:05.399
Right there.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.536
She shouldn't be.

45:13.911 --> 45:15.538
Yo, what you doing here, man?

45:15.612 --> 45:19.013
Oh, please don't tell me
that's your new crew.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.313
- No.
- Yeah, we're her crew.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.410
Getting ready to battle at The Streets.

45:23.487 --> 45:25.352
What street, Sesame Street?

45:25.422 --> 45:28.220
- What do you know about The Streets?
- Why don't you back off?

45:28.292 --> 45:30.157
We're just here
to check a few things out.

45:30.227 --> 45:34.857
This is how you've been wasting
your time, with these losers?

45:34.932 --> 45:37.400
Why don't you do your thing?
We're gonna do ours.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.402
You got a thing that you do?

45:39.470 --> 45:41.563
Why don't you show us now, homeboy?

45:43.373 --> 45:45.364
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

45:48.612 --> 45:51.775
Hey, yo, DJ Sand!
Drop that beat, homey.

45:51.849 --> 45:54.010
Looks like we've got new fish in town.

45:54.084 --> 45:57.542
Let's clear the dance floor.
See what they talking about.

45:57.621 --> 46:00.852
Now, you come into my house,
you recognize what's going on.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.256
Don't step in that circle
if you ain't got it.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.234
When do we start?

46:12.302 --> 46:14.270
Five. Start on five when I start.

46:14.338 --> 46:18.707
The music's playing already.
Dance to the music.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.180
That's not how we do it here.

46:29.253 --> 46:31.118
<i>This ain't High School Musical.</i>

46:33.724 --> 46:35.658
That's how you dance?
Your mama taught you that?

46:35.726 --> 46:37.193
We don't dance like that.

46:37.261 --> 46:39.559
That's what you learned
at your special school?

46:39.630 --> 46:41.894
Boo! Quit it!

46:41.965 --> 46:43.762
That's atrocious.

46:43.834 --> 46:45.927
That's it. No more.

46:46.003 --> 46:49.700
No more.
What in the hell was that?

46:50.941 --> 46:52.806
That's how you dance?
I'll tell you what.

46:52.876 --> 46:54.844
We gonna show you
how we really get down.

46:54.912 --> 46:56.777
Y'all pick up a keychain
on the way out.

46:56.847 --> 46:59.577
Tell your mama not to be late
picking you up from work.

46:59.650 --> 47:01.618
You guys are garbage!

47:01.685 --> 47:05.018
Lets get it. Four-one-oh,
can we get it started?

47:05.088 --> 47:06.919
Let's get it started. Here we go.

47:06.990 --> 47:09.481
Four-one-oh, forget them.
Let's get it.

47:25.442 --> 47:28.036
That's what I'm talking about.

47:28.111 --> 47:30.170
See how they entertaining?

47:59.710 --> 48:01.507
That's how we do it.

48:04.147 --> 48:06.342
You can't learn that in school!

48:06.416 --> 48:08.646
Let's just...
Let's just regroup tomorrow.

48:10.287 --> 48:11.686
Come on.

48:14.791 --> 48:14.892
Guys, come on.
This is one performance.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.122
Guys, come on.
This is one performance.

48:17.194 --> 48:18.593
You can't let it get you down.

48:18.662 --> 48:21.222
We didn't work
this hard to just give up.

48:21.298 --> 48:23.789
Shouldn't have
went there in the first place.

48:23.867 --> 48:25.095
We looked like idiots.

48:25.168 --> 48:28.069
Chase, the choreography
wasn't right for this.

48:28.138 --> 48:30.163
No, it wasn't.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.229
I'm telling you.

48:35.412 --> 48:37.880
- Hey.
- It's cool. I know her.

48:41.585 --> 48:43.109
What are you doing here?

48:43.186 --> 48:44.744
Things got out of hand last night.

48:44.821 --> 48:46.618
Yeah. Thanks for your support.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.453
Look, I'm sorry.

48:48.525 --> 48:50.425
What they did to you was wrong.

48:50.494 --> 48:53.122
- But you should know that I quit.
- What?

48:53.196 --> 48:56.222
Yeah. They're on such
a power trip. I refuse.

48:56.300 --> 48:58.564
I thought we were supposed
to be about family.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.933
And it just wasn't
the same without you.

49:02.139 --> 49:06.075
But, look, I miss you.
I haven't seen you in that long.

49:06.143 --> 49:08.304
My family's having
a barbeque this Saturday.

49:08.378 --> 49:09.743
Why don't you come through?

49:09.813 --> 49:13.249
- So that's why you came by?
- Yeah.

49:16.420 --> 49:19.287
You know, Felicia is going to
trip if she knows you're here.

49:19.356 --> 49:22.086
Felicia should be the last
of your worries right now.

49:23.160 --> 49:26.061
I swear, we're really not that bad.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.596
Really. Come on.

49:32.069 --> 49:35.732
Hey, you guys,
this is my girl, Missy.

49:35.806 --> 49:39.708
She's here to, uh... help us out.

49:39.776 --> 49:42.506
Help us out?
We bombed last night.

49:42.579 --> 49:44.604
Our respect
went out the window.

49:44.681 --> 49:46.774
Sure did.

49:52.756 --> 49:54.883
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

49:54.958 --> 49:57.791
What are y'all talking about,
respect went out the window?

49:57.861 --> 50:00.557
Like respect is going?
You can always get it back.

50:00.630 --> 50:02.461
What are you all thinking
for The Prank?

50:02.532 --> 50:04.500
What's The Prank?

50:04.568 --> 50:08.527
Yo, D, you ain't tell them
about The Prank?

50:08.605 --> 50:11.870
The Prank is what the crews do to show
they're competing for The Streets.

50:11.942 --> 50:15.105
It's a public declaration
saying that you're bringing it.

50:15.178 --> 50:16.543
The crazier it is, the better.

50:16.613 --> 50:19.013
For proof you gotta record it
and post it online.

50:19.082 --> 50:21.175
Then it spreads like wildfire.

50:21.251 --> 50:25.915
And if you guys hit it like I know
you can, y'all get your respect back.

50:27.524 --> 50:29.185
I got an idea.

50:29.259 --> 50:32.888
Watch this, watch this! Oh-ho!

50:32.963 --> 50:35.261
Been runnin' that ball
on him all day, son.

50:35.332 --> 50:37.266
That's what I'm talkin' about.

50:37.334 --> 50:38.995
- Yo, man.
- Yo!

50:39.069 --> 50:42.197
Why's my crib smell like Funyuns,
broccoli and ball sweat?

50:42.272 --> 50:45.298
It's your boy, Crumbs.
He's been letting it loose all day.

50:45.375 --> 50:46.899
It's the coffee, bro.

50:49.880 --> 50:53.714
Yo, Tuck, come see this.
You gotta come see this, bro.

52:44.394 --> 52:45.418
Oh, dang!

52:45.495 --> 52:47.827
- Relax, relax.
- That's my computer, man!

52:57.641 --> 52:59.268
Man, clean this fish up!

53:24.234 --> 53:25.724
Moose, what are you doing?

53:25.802 --> 53:28.669
Maybe we should put you back
in that grandma suit, huh?

53:28.738 --> 53:30.501
Who's we?

53:42.385 --> 53:44.012
Hey, what are you guys doing?

53:44.087 --> 53:47.147
- Hi, Sophie. What's up?
- Rehearsing for the fundraiser.

53:48.158 --> 53:49.648
Why are you here on a Saturday?

53:49.726 --> 53:52.559
We were gonna do the same thing,
but it's locked.

53:52.629 --> 53:55.427
- We gotta roll, so we'll see y'all.
- Where are we going?

53:55.498 --> 53:58.331
To my house. My family's
having a barbecue, remember?

53:58.401 --> 54:00.801
- Yeah, yeah, barbecue.
- Why you standing there?

54:00.870 --> 54:01.859
Let's be out.

54:06.276 --> 54:07.607
Are you going with them?

54:08.612 --> 54:12.139
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'd say you should go, but...

54:12.215 --> 54:14.149
But I'm not really sure
it's your scene.

54:15.151 --> 54:16.778
I'd love to.

54:18.321 --> 54:19.447
All right.

54:24.127 --> 54:26.618
Watch your step. Welcome.

54:26.696 --> 54:29.096
- Look at how nice it is.
- Thank you.

54:29.165 --> 54:31.224
Come down, hurry up.
Y'all taking mad long.

54:31.301 --> 54:34.361
Hey, Mom!

54:34.437 --> 54:36.302
How are you?

54:37.607 --> 54:40.576
We missed you.
Everyone is here. Come in.

54:40.644 --> 54:42.737
- Have some food.
- Whoa, wait.

54:42.812 --> 54:44.746
You're coming with me.

54:44.814 --> 54:46.475
- Where are we going?
- You'll see.

54:57.661 --> 54:59.390
I can't believe I'm doing this.

54:59.462 --> 55:01.453
What's wrong with what I had before?

55:01.531 --> 55:04.364
Latin men like their girls
to look like women, not boys.

55:04.434 --> 55:06.834
A fact you'll appreciate
when you meet my cousin.

55:06.903 --> 55:08.461
You are not setting me up.

55:08.538 --> 55:11.006
Alejandro's nice. Plus he just got here.

55:11.074 --> 55:13.338
You're pimping me out
so that your cousin

55:13.410 --> 55:14.604
can get a green card?

55:14.678 --> 55:16.373
He's from Florida.

55:16.446 --> 55:19.643
Trust me, if he was not my cousin,
you would not be standing there.

55:19.716 --> 55:22.276
- You're sick.
- Hmm.

55:22.352 --> 55:24.252
And I'm hungry,
so are we done here?

55:24.321 --> 55:25.583
I guess.

55:27.157 --> 55:28.886
Ooh, Miss Thing, you got titties?

55:28.958 --> 55:31.620
Why you trying to look
better than me at my party?

55:40.003 --> 55:41.595
- Hey, cuz.
- Hey, mama.

55:41.671 --> 55:43.798
How you doing?
This is my friend, Andie.

55:43.873 --> 55:45.534
Andie, my cousin, Alejandro.

55:45.608 --> 55:47.769
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

55:47.844 --> 55:49.903
I'm just gonna sit down
while you guys talk.

55:49.979 --> 55:52.311
- You want to dance a real dance?
- I'd love to.

55:52.382 --> 55:53.508
Come on, mama.

56:16.906 --> 56:20.535
- May I borrow your boyfriend?
- Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

56:20.610 --> 56:23.579
It doesn't matter. It's just a dance.

56:23.646 --> 56:24.977
It's just a dance.

57:11.761 --> 57:13.058
Andie, come here.

57:13.129 --> 57:14.824
You should really wait your turn.

57:14.898 --> 57:18.061
- Ooh.
- I couldn't.

57:18.134 --> 57:20.102
I didn't know you could salsa.

57:20.170 --> 57:21.831
There's a lot you don't know about me.

57:21.905 --> 57:25.204
Which is surprising, considering
how much you talk about yourself.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.264
Ooh.

58:28.004 --> 58:29.699
What's going on over here?

58:45.255 --> 58:49.715
My goodness, Aunt Maria.
It has been emotional.

58:49.792 --> 58:52.386
I'll hit you up on MySpace sometime.

58:52.462 --> 58:54.396
Thank you. You are charming.

58:54.464 --> 58:56.728
- Thank you so much.
- I had a good time.

58:56.799 --> 58:59.097
Me, too. Don't tell
your husband about us, now.

58:59.168 --> 59:02.865
- Bye.
- Hey.

59:05.742 --> 59:08.506
God?

59:08.578 --> 59:11.547
You want to fly up here and give me
a hand with these lights?

59:12.749 --> 59:15.274
Sophie, what's up, girl?
Let me find out.

59:15.351 --> 59:18.514
<i>You got a lot of stuff going.
A lot of sofrito up in you.</i>

59:18.588 --> 59:20.920
Thank you.
You're not so bad yourself.

59:20.990 --> 59:24.687
<i>Gracias, gracias.
Moose, help me with these lights.</i>

59:24.761 --> 59:26.422
Mom's gonna kill me. Hurry up.

59:26.496 --> 59:29.761
- Hurry up!
- Hold this. I'm coming.

59:31.668 --> 59:33.158
Sophie, I'll do it, I'll do it.

59:33.236 --> 59:35.704
I'll do it. You're welcome.

59:36.906 --> 59:39.431
- There we go.
- This is really high.

59:39.509 --> 59:41.773
No, it's not that bad.

59:43.212 --> 59:46.943
- Yes, it is.
- No, we're good.

59:47.016 --> 59:50.884
All right. Tree climber.

59:53.323 --> 59:56.019
All right, this is gonna
sound cheesy, but...

59:58.661 --> 01:00:02.927
...for what it's worth,
I'm really glad you're at MSA.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:07.192
I think you were doing
just fine before I got there.

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:10.398
That's just the thing.
I mean, I've been trained to dance

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.805
since I first learned to walk.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:17.335
But it's always been about
doing it their way and it's just not me.

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:22.350
But, ever since you came,
I feel more like myself.

01:00:26.222 --> 01:00:28.554
Oh, geez.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:33.295
Well, I know what you mean.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:38.428
My mom always used to tell me,
"Just be yourself."

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.233
When I was little
that sounded strange,

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:44.773
'cause I was like,
"How could I be anyone else?"

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:49.567
- I bet you miss her.
- Yeah.

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:59.185
When she got cancer, it was like
the floor fell from underneath.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.883
I've just been running ever since.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.358
But now I can't find my way back.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:11.489
Well, maybe it's not about going back.

01:01:11.567 --> 01:01:14.695
Maybe it's about being
right where you are.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:52.037
I heard you was
dancing it up in there.

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:54.235
What, you not joking now?

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.411
Come on, guys,
I'm just trying to get home.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:00.711
You thought it was real funny,
what you did the other day.

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:03.274
- Tuck, it's a joke.
- Look here.

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:06.446
Just 'cause you hang out with D
don't mean you got what it takes.

01:02:06.522 --> 01:02:08.353
She don't know where she came from.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.517
You don't know anything about her.

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:14.553
So now you defending her?

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:16.757
Yes, I am.
I'll see you at The Streets.

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.631
At The Streets?
You in the streets now.

01:02:25.141 --> 01:02:26.802
Unless you want some more of us,

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.867
I suggest you stay away
from The Streets.

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:32.108
And stay farther away from Andie.
Drop this fool.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:37.613
Come on, get up, fool.

01:02:37.687 --> 01:02:39.484
Get up!

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:41.420
Yeah. Ha.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.288
You're not so funny now,

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.553
are you, clown?

01:02:44.627 --> 01:02:46.788
Hey, yo, Tuck.

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:08.983
Hey.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:11.918
- Chase, what's going on?
- Hey.

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:13.983
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:14.056 --> 01:03:18.049
How you doing? Is everything OK?

01:03:19.061 --> 01:03:21.928
Yes, everything's OK.
Why wouldn't everything be OK?

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.401
- Oh, my God. What happened to you?
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.836
Don't worry. Listen,
I've got to get to class.

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:32.841
That is not nothing.
Who did this to you?

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:36.367
Just forget about it. Let it go.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.496
Who did this?

01:04:33.669 --> 01:04:36.502
Does anybody know
who is responsible for this?

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:44.744
This school will not be associated
with these competitions.

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:46.679
Any future involvement

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:49.445
by our students in The Streets
will lead to expulsion.

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:55.219
And anyone with any information
is expected to come forward.

01:04:56.592 --> 01:04:58.423
Get this place cleaned up.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:07.526
Man, I can't believe
they trashed the studio.

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:09.468
Now we have Director Collins
on our back.

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:12.336
- Glass is all over the floor.
- Somebody broke the stereo.

01:05:12.408 --> 01:05:13.966
I don't understand.

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.567
These guys are no joke.

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.203
Collins was pissed.

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.874
- Graffiti was everywhere.
- What are we gonna do?

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:22.611
- We could get expelled.
- My parents would kill me

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:23.674
if I got expelled.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.517
I'd have to go to a regular school
with regular kids.

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:28.784
Hey, guys.

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.890
This has gotten way out of hand.

01:05:34.397 --> 01:05:36.558
I'm really sorry
that I got you all into this.

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:38.623
Andie, don't say that.

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:40.965
I put everything you guys
worked for at risk.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.902
And it's not fair.

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:46.408
- We're all in on this together.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:48.534
No, it's over.

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:55.180
The crew's done. I don't know
what we were thinking.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.879
Andie West, Director Collins
would like to see you.

01:06:21.043 --> 01:06:23.739
By being involved in this
you've brought delinquent

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:26.475
behavior into my school
and put my students at risk.

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:29.017
And now the studio
has been vandalized.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.678
It wasn't exactly like that.

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:35.748
I thought I could train you,

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.453
turn you into the dancer
that you could be.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.687
But I was wrong.

01:06:41.764 --> 01:06:43.891
There's nothing
that we can do for someone

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:46.457
who doesn't appreciate
what's in front of them.

01:06:47.903 --> 01:06:49.165
I understand.

01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:56.769
You know, I really did try.

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:03.312
I'm not done.

01:07:05.621 --> 01:07:08.556
Was there anyone else involved
from this school?

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:11.719
No.

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:16.297
No one else. Just me.

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:18.663
Then I have no choice
but to expel you.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.895
- But I didn't...
- I'm sorry.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:23.700
That's it. I'm finished. Please leave.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.348
Andie.

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.819
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.914
- What are we gonna do?
- It's done.

01:07:41.991 --> 01:07:43.481
Everything's done.

01:07:45.027 --> 01:07:47.894
I think it's pretty clear that
none of this was meant to be.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.155
Whoa, Andie.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.527
Don't do this.

01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:57.930
Please just... Just let it go.

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:10.516
- You got that?
- Mm-hmm

01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.577
You're my big strong boy, huh?

01:08:12.655 --> 01:08:14.646
I am your big strong boy.

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:28.461
Your school called.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.562
I know I said things
would be different...

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:31.697
I know what happened.

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.800
No more excuses, Andie.
I'm sick and tired of this.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:39.176
You're going to your aunt's
in Texas, and that's final.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.421
It was my idea.

01:08:46.589 --> 01:08:49.149
- Your idea for what?
- To compete in The Streets.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.421
If you're gonna throw someone out
it should have been me.

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:54.861
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not throwing you out.

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.488
How would that make me look?

01:08:56.564 --> 01:08:58.590
I'm not gonna let her
take the fall for this.

01:08:58.667 --> 01:09:00.259
I should never have let her in.

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:02.964
It didn't benefit us in any way.

01:09:03.037 --> 01:09:05.438
Not everything we do has to benefit us.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:09.501
Some people, Andie in particular,
do what they love just because.

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.944
Isn't that why we started dancing
in the first place?

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:15.346
Look, I have a lot to do
for the fundraiser.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.782
And so do you.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:20.810
My decision about Andie is final.
We're done here.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:46.627
Oh, Peggy Beckham.

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.813
See, this is our new building.

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:42.220
Made of glass
with state-of-the-art studios.

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:41.642
Hey. Is Andie here?

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.083
Andie?

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.587
It's for you.

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.428
- What are you guys doing here?
- Andie, we're going.

01:13:54.496 --> 01:13:57.556
Eighth and Main, The Streets.
We need you.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.464
No, but what about the fundraiser?

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:01.969
- You could all be expelled.
- Forget the fundraiser.

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:04.733
- We don't want the school to move.
- It's time we took a stand.

01:14:04.807 --> 01:14:06.934
- Like you did.
- If MSA doesn't want you...

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:09.910
- Then we don't want you.
- What are you talking about?

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:13.470
We do want Andie.
We want Andie in, yes, right?

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:16.450
- Yes.
- Look, you brought us together

01:14:16.518 --> 01:14:19.385
and took the fall for us
when we should have all done more.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.389
Andie, that's why we're here.

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.392
We've all made a lot of mistakes,
but now's our time.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.088
We can go all the way.
If we don't try, it was all for nothing.

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:28.823
Come on, are you in?

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:31.560
- I can't.
- Why?

01:14:31.633 --> 01:14:34.033
I promised Sarah
I'd finish packing tonight.

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:35.501
Andie?

01:14:37.272 --> 01:14:38.466
Can we talk a minute?

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:42.476
Yeah. I'll be right back.

01:14:49.451 --> 01:14:51.749
I made a promise to your mom
to take care of you.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:52.878
I want to keep it.

01:14:54.056 --> 01:14:56.081
I know.

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:59.355
I understand that
and I am done fighting.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.961
You know, you remind me
so much of your mother.

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.500
You have her passion.

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:09.867
She was a really good friend
to me, Andie.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:13.135
Just like you are to them.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:16.507
I just feel like I finally found
this place where I belong.

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.444
I found people who believe in me.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:23.542
I believe in you, too.

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:26.019
I've seen a change in you.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:31.150
You should go tonight.

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.357
Really?

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.990
She'd want you to.

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:47.263
Let's do this.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:53.948
Baltimore, y'all ready?

01:15:57.119 --> 01:15:59.815
We gonna get down to it,
see who has the hottest skills.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:02.686
The dopest squad.
You ready to get it started?

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.692
It's The Streets, baby.

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:11.194
- Take a left.
- And slow down.

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:13.734
Faster, faster! I love America!

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:18.933
Whoo!

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:39.559
It's your man, DJ Sand,
and it's the battle of the year.

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.892
We're getting ready to get
really banoodles out here.

01:16:41.964 --> 01:16:43.556
Can y'all handle that?

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.968
Come on, let's get wild, man.

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:49.663
Yo, man, you see this?

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:57.039
- Are you coming?
- Good luck. Good luck.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:10.015
What part of "You don't belong here"
do you not understand?

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:11.559
Why don't you chill?

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:14.061
We're just trying to perform here
like everyone else.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.926
Yo, homey, this is how it is.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:19.263
You're not invited.
This is a closed event.

01:17:19.334 --> 01:17:21.234
For locals only.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.965
Besides, that jazz funk
that y'all pulled at the Dragon

01:17:24.039 --> 01:17:25.233
ain't gonna cut it here.

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:28.174
Neither will those moves
you've been doing the past five years.

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:30.268
And by the way,
I really liked your place,

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.745
but I think that fish
made it smell better.

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:35.339
Watch your face.
I'll knock you out, you hear?

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:38.318
- Don't disrespect me in my place.
- You boys fighting in my house now?

01:17:38.387 --> 01:17:40.082
You're think you're funny?

01:17:40.155 --> 01:17:43.022
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:17:43.091 --> 01:17:44.786
They're at The Streets.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.323
The Streets?

01:17:48.897 --> 01:17:50.660
- I have to stop this.
- Wait.

01:17:52.901 --> 01:17:55.836
You always tell us that dance
is about having something to say.

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:57.166
I never meant for anyone...

01:17:57.239 --> 01:18:00.299
I think that a lot of people
are finally speaking up.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.867
Can't allow my students
to participate in something illegal.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:06.413
Well, there's a reason
they're there and not here.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:10.718
You should take a look.
I think you'd be surprised.

01:18:10.786 --> 01:18:13.516
- And you are?
- Robert Alexander, III.

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:16.216
But you can call me Moose.
I dance with their crew.

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:17.451
You dance?

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.686
Damn right, I dance.
I can take you to where they are.

01:18:21.763 --> 01:18:23.458
OK, Goose, let's go.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:25.864
- No, it's Moose.
- Whatever.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:27.299
Wait. I'm coming with you.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.929
It's the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:18:30.005 --> 01:18:33.964
At this time, let me introduce
the five time reigning champ.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:39.378
Give it up, make some noise,
for the Four-one-oh!

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:55.328
Get it, Four-one-oh, let's go!

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.014
Let's go!

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:17.706
Check it out, baby!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.901
Check it out, baby!
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:22.569
Give it up to the Four-one-oh!

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.509
All right, you've seen 'em all.

01:21:24.579 --> 01:21:27.173
Tell me who the hottest crew
in Baltimore is.

01:21:27.249 --> 01:21:30.184
That's what you think? I don't know,
the Four-one-oh killed it.

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:33.050
- All right, y'all, let's hit it.
- Yo, baby.

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:36.022
No, B, we're from the hood.

01:21:36.091 --> 01:21:39.117
Yo, this is a neighborhood battle.

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:42.925
You're out of luck.
Now, go home. Leave.

01:21:42.998 --> 01:21:44.226
That's mad wack, B.

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:47.325
We're gonna get to it,
figure it out after this.

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:52.733
Andie!

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:59.341
Hey, yo, it's not done yet.
We've got one more for you.

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:02.577
- My crew's back there. We want a shot.
- We're done. Doesn't matter.

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.516
Not from around here,
but we want a shot.

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.213
Hey!

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:09.052
- Yo!
- Boo!

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.024
Look.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:13.583
We're all here because...

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:17.894
All right, all right.
Yo. Some of you guys think...

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:20.366
Some of you guys think
that we don't belong here.

01:22:20.435 --> 01:22:23.268
- What is she doing?
- It doesn't matter where we're from.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.533
You are not the valedictorian.

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.905
All right, all right.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:30.206
Let me just say something.

01:22:30.278 --> 01:22:34.408
The Streets are supposed to be about
different people coming together.

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:38.843
We call this a battle,
but what are we fighting for?

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.787
We're all here because we have
this thing we do. We dance.

01:22:41.856 --> 01:22:43.448
Right?

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:46.926
Being a part of The Street
used to mean more than turf or power.

01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:49.691
It was about bringing
something new to the floor.

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:54.257
And it shouldn't matter what we wear,

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:56.600
what school
or what neighborhood we're from.

01:22:56.671 --> 01:23:00.573
Because the best part of The Streets
is, it's not about what you've got.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:02.974
It's what you make of what you've got.

01:23:07.182 --> 01:23:11.243
So, if the Four-one-oh is too scared
to defend their title against us,

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:15.278
then, hell, we'll be outside doing
our thing where The Streets started.

01:23:17.926 --> 01:23:19.757
We'll accept that.

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:41.542
I'm sure we've got something
that will work.

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.311
- La-da!
- Ooh!

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.750
Hit it, hit it, hit it.

01:27:27.942 --> 01:27:29.375
Go, go, go!

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.842
Yeah, we did it, baby.

01:28:38.913 --> 01:28:40.744
Whoo-hoo!

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:46.513
All right! Whoo!

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.335
Well. That was different.

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:04.667
Yes, sorry about
the whole toe-pointing thing.

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:07.299
Yeah. I guess that
didn't stick too well.

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:08.706
I'll keep working on that.

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:12.007
Yeah, you will, in my class.
At school on Monday.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.479
Oh, my God!

01:29:13.548 --> 01:29:16.312
Whoa. Hey, Moose!

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.215
Yeah, you.

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:21.687
I think you might be
in the wrong department.

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.557
Now, if you'll excuse me,

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.389
I have a little explaining to do
at a fundraiser.

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:28.793
Oh, yeah.

01:29:31.733 --> 01:29:34.133
So, see, I told you
we could help each other out.

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.193
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.033
Whatever.

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:43.139
Blow it up.

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:46.874
- Moose, hey.
- Hey, Soph.

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.540
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

01:29:48.616 --> 01:29:50.311
- Did you see us?
- That was great.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:53.252
Sliding and flipping.
My hat trick was amazing.

01:29:53.321 --> 01:29:56.813
I was just doing it,
like it was amazing.

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.430
That's what I thought.

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.735
Andie! Andie!

01:30:12.807 --> 01:30:14.069
Hey!

01:30:14.142 --> 01:30:16.007
Happy birthday.
Open your present.

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:17.203
Blow out your candles.

01:30:17.278 --> 01:30:19.109
You did so good.
I'm so proud of you.

01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:22.672
- Andie, I love you.
- I love you.

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:26.151
I gotta go.
I gotta pump. I gotta pump.

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:43.535
I thought you said we couldn't
start our own crew.

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:46.129
I thought you said
my dancing was little.

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:50.007
Look around. You brought
all these people out here.
