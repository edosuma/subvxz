- Inspector.
- Watts.

02:11.966 --> 02:14.032
What's going on?
- Water.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.668
- I can see that. I mean this...

02:16.737 --> 02:19.037
- I've taken up
the sport of running.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.306
- What for?
- It clears the head.

02:21.308 --> 02:24.309
- So does a good drop of scotch.
- I have a favour

02:24.378 --> 02:26.578
to ask, Inspector. There is
a case I want to look into.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.715
- Well then, look.
- This case is somewhat

02:29.783 --> 02:31.750
in the jurisdiction
of Station House One.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.952
Lucille Palmer was a witness

02:34.020 --> 02:35.921
in a case of mine years back.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.057
Bright young thing. She was
found dead in an opium den

02:39.125 --> 02:42.060
nine days ago.
- That happens.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.029
- Yes, but Lucille didn't

02:44.097 --> 02:46.398
use dope in excess,
she was shot.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.734
- Who's handling the case?
- Inspector McWorthy. There has

02:49.803 --> 02:52.737
been no progress since the day
after her body was found.

02:52.806 --> 02:54.873
- Ordinarily, I wouldn't mind

02:54.942 --> 02:56.742
you looking
into Station One's work...

02:56.810 --> 02:58.777
but I've got something cooking

02:58.845 --> 03:00.612
at the moment, and I don't
want you mucking it up.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.281
- So I can't do this?

03:03.350 --> 03:05.116
- I'm saying mind your step.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.786
Now, get yourself cleaned up
in the water closet. Running may

03:07.854 --> 03:09.621
clear your head, but it's
not doing much for the air

03:09.623 --> 03:11.924
in here. Oh, Murdoch.
(sniffing)

03:11.992 --> 03:15.093
Here, take these.

03:15.161 --> 03:17.095
- Sir?

03:17.097 --> 03:19.030
- These are my way
of saying goodbye.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.933
- You're leaving again?

03:21.001 --> 03:22.968
- Not me. You.

03:22.970 --> 03:25.136
The inspector position
at Station House Five.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.472
Slorach's gone, and I've
recommended you for the job.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.307
And I'm not the only one.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.643
- (sighing): I'm afraid
that's a waste of time.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.712
- You don't want it?

03:33.780 --> 03:35.580
- Sir, we both know
that the furthest

03:35.649 --> 03:37.582
a Catholic can advance
in the Constabulary

03:37.585 --> 03:39.384
is, well, this.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.620
- It seems the times,
they are a-changing.

03:41.688 --> 03:44.522
You have a friend in high
places. And he's a lot like you.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.725
- A Catholic?
- A progressive type.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.660
Allen Templeton.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.528
His father-in-law is the head
of the Board of Control.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.864
Now, he likes to play kingmaker,

03:52.866 --> 03:54.800
and he's got his eye on you.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.702
It can't hurt to try, Murdoch.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.473
(door opening)

04:01.475 --> 04:04.009
- Mr. Johnston is expected
at the funeral home,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.144
and when you return,
Mr. Morgan will be ready

04:06.212 --> 04:08.247
for the incinerator.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.284
Detective. What can I
do for you?

04:12.352 --> 04:14.653
- I'd like to see
Lucille Palmer's body,

04:14.721 --> 04:16.688
Miss Hart.
- Lucille Palmer...

04:16.756 --> 04:18.757
Gunshot to the chest?
- Yes.

04:18.825 --> 04:20.759
Have you recovered a bullet?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.761
- No, it went through the body
but was not found.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.997
Detective, isn't this
Inspector McWorthy's case?

04:26.066 --> 04:29.701
- I believe so, but I've
a personal interest.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.870
(chuckling)

04:31.938 --> 04:34.373
That's... amusing?

04:34.441 --> 04:37.442
- You policemen have
a lot of "personal interests."

04:37.510 --> 04:40.512
Miss Palmer's best friend,
Isabel Carmichael,

04:40.514 --> 04:43.448
identified the remains.
- Still trying to discern

04:43.516 --> 04:45.350
the source of the amusement.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.787
- She came here on the arm
of Constable John Brackenreid.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.523
The two looked
a little more than just cozy.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.925
Please.

04:53.993 --> 04:56.294
I guess the uniform
works on some women.

04:56.363 --> 04:58.130
- But not you, Miss Hart?

04:58.198 --> 05:01.066
- I'm aiming a little higher.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.704
(ominous music)

05:09.609 --> 05:11.677
(approaching footsteps)

05:18.184 --> 05:20.218
- Constable.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.823
(chair creaking)
- Miss Newsome.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.427
You've not come to sue me
again, have you?
- Not at all.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.295
But I am here
on a professional errand.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.731
- Is that right?
- I am articling

05:32.799 --> 05:35.600
with the Crown Attorney. He has
asked me to research all
files in relation

05:35.668 --> 05:37.836
to the enforcement
of the Chinese laundry tax.

05:37.838 --> 05:40.238
- Good Lord.
What did you do wrong?

05:40.306 --> 05:43.108
- Nothing at all. In fact,
I came top of my class.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.510
- Well, trust a lawyer to work
that into the conversation.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.612
- Trust a constable
to take offence.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.248
Anyway, this is
a plum assignment

05:50.250 --> 05:52.517
and I intend to do my best work
on it. So if you will be

05:52.585 --> 05:54.619
so kind as to point me
in the direction of the records,

05:54.687 --> 05:57.756
I shall be on my way.
- I'm afraid I can't.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.425
- Pardon?
- Those files can't leave

06:00.493 --> 06:02.260
the station, Miss Newsome.
While you're here, you can

06:02.262 --> 06:05.063
examine them
as long as you like.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.432
- It seems I'll be spending
some time here with you, then...

06:07.500 --> 06:10.068
Constable.
- Well, don't worry.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.170
We don't need to talk.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.850
Thank you.

06:25.919 --> 06:29.154
Allen Templeton suggested
the promotion

06:29.222 --> 06:32.657
and has already written
a letter of recommendation.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.627
- Well you certainly deserve it.
- It's complimentary,

06:35.695 --> 06:37.629
to be sure,
but doesn't the man realize

06:37.631 --> 06:39.631
he's pursuing a lost cause?

06:39.699 --> 06:42.534
- Perhaps he believes he can
convince the Board of Control.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.503
You do have a stellar record.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.505
And now, you've literally
written the book

06:47.574 --> 06:50.608
on police investigation.
- With your help.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.845
I've had a good record
for a number of years.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.246
That's never been
enough to overcome

06:55.249 --> 06:57.348
anti-Catholic sentiment before.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.150
- Perhaps that's
about to change.

06:59.219 --> 07:02.120
Progress is slow,
but it does come, William.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.055
I am proof of that.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.561
- I suppose you're right.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.663
Anything is possible.

07:11.731 --> 07:14.199
- Precisely.
But is this something

07:14.201 --> 07:16.668
you actually want?
It would be a big change.

07:16.736 --> 07:19.070
- A supervising position,

07:19.138 --> 07:21.606
a completely different
station house.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.576
Perhaps I could
formalize a system

07:24.644 --> 07:28.880
to pass on my investigative
techniques. I...

07:28.948 --> 07:32.551
You know, Julia, I believe
this is something I want.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.690
(laughing)

07:38.758 --> 07:40.692

07:40.694 --> 07:42.894
it appears.
(chuckling)

07:42.896 --> 07:46.498
- One of your detectives has
been sniffing around

07:46.566 --> 07:48.299
a case of mine. I'd like
you to tug his leash.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.869
- Sniffing how?
- He visited Miss Hart,

07:50.937 --> 07:53.638
asked about my business.
- The victim was

07:53.640 --> 07:56.608
an acquaintance. Doesn't sound
like he's overstepped.

07:56.676 --> 07:58.276
- Whatever Detective Watts
thinks he knows

07:58.344 --> 08:01.145
about Lucille Palmer,
she wasn't what she seemed.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.248
Pretty girl
from a good family, right?

08:03.316 --> 08:06.518
Well, her body was found
in that abandoned building

08:06.586 --> 08:08.620
near Union Station where
the dope fiends like to go.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.455
The man that was
with her was seen

08:10.457 --> 08:12.290
boarding a train
out of town the next day.

08:12.358 --> 08:15.660
- And that's where the
investigation ended, did it?

08:15.662 --> 08:18.363
- No. I put out the man's
description to the railway lines

08:18.431 --> 08:20.798
and law enforcement.
What more would you have me do?

08:20.801 --> 08:22.967
- Fair enough.
- That's what I thought,

08:23.036 --> 08:24.802
so tell your man to back off.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.638
- I'll pass it along.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.973
- Throw some weight
behind it, Tom.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.143
I know about your plan to move
Detective Murdoch up the ladder.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.613
You hear that McPherson
from Hamilton

08:34.681 --> 08:36.481
is making noises
about moving to the big city?

08:36.483 --> 08:38.416
Good solid Ulsterman.

08:38.485 --> 08:41.419
- Is that so?
- I could talk him out of it,

08:41.488 --> 08:43.354
leave the way clear for Murdoch,

08:43.357 --> 08:45.456
but you'd have to make it

08:45.525 --> 08:47.525
worth my while.
- Margaret.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.929
- I knew I'd find
you here, Thomas.

08:50.997 --> 08:53.531
- Think about what I said.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.768
Lovely to see you,
Mrs. Brackenreid.

08:56.836 --> 08:58.703
- Let's have a seat.

09:00.474 --> 09:02.373
When did you get back?
- Last night.

09:02.442 --> 09:05.443
Everything is just fine at
the house. John says you've been

09:05.512 --> 09:08.279
checking in on it.
- It's a good house.

09:08.348 --> 09:11.182
Can't have it falling apart
from neglect.

09:11.184 --> 09:14.953
- I didn't ask you to move out.
- You left first.

09:14.955 --> 09:18.323
Let's just say we've both made
mistakes and leave it at that.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.225
But you're back now,
so let's put the past

09:21.294 --> 09:23.194
behind us and get
the family back together.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.663
(sighing)
- Yes...

09:25.666 --> 09:28.399
I've had a lot of time
to think about this, Thomas.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.735
And... John's a grown man.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.670
Bobby's off to boarding school.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.340
There is no reason
to keep up appearances.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.542
- "Appearances"?
What are you on about?

09:37.544 --> 09:41.045
- I've made a decision...
I want you to give me a divorce.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.947
It will come
as no surprise to anyone,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.949
given the year we've had.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.918
- Well, it's
a bloody surprise to me.

09:46.986 --> 09:48.987
- Well, maybe you haven't
been paying attention.

09:49.055 --> 09:52.691
- This is the most ridiculous
idea you've ever had.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.895
And if you think I'm going
to agree to it,

09:57.898 --> 10:00.264
then you've forgotten
who you're married to,

10:00.333 --> 10:02.367
Mrs. Brackenreid.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.376
-

10:11.378 --> 10:14.646
- You're up bright and early,
Miss Newsome.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.848
If you hadn't noticed,
I put all the files

10:16.916 --> 10:19.050
pertinent to your laundry tax
case right here

10:19.119 --> 10:22.420
at Constable Higgins' desk.
- That desk is very dirty.

10:22.488 --> 10:25.857
- No it isn't.
- Be that as it may,

10:25.925 --> 10:28.326
this is my desk.
- Do feel free

10:28.395 --> 10:30.528
to take your typewriter
if you need it.

10:30.530 --> 10:33.064
- Will you be using
your typewriter, Constable?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.367
- Yes. Yes, I will.
Right here, at my desk.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.536
- Hm.
- George.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.805
You can't let her
get away with this.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.808
- No, I won't. In fact...

10:43.876 --> 10:46.611
you'll just have to share.

10:46.613 --> 10:48.780
- Suit yourself.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.982
- Ah! Thank you,
Detective Watts.

10:52.952 --> 10:54.919
Ow.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.355
- You two. Clear off.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.958
Higgins, put the kettle on.

11:00.026 --> 11:01.926
Watts, stay where you are.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.831
Your case is a dead end.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.967
- Do you really believe that?

11:09.035 --> 11:10.902
- McWorthy said
they tried and couldn't find

11:10.904 --> 11:13.304
the man who killed Miss Palmer.
Now, if you're caught sniffing

11:13.372 --> 11:15.273
around again, Murdoch's chances

11:15.341 --> 11:17.175
at becoming an inspector
will be in jeopardy.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.644
- Oh. So, it's for the best
that I back away.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.779
- I never said that. You did.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.482
Mr. Templeton. What a pleasure.
- Sorry to disturb you.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.885
- Oh, no. We're finished.
- I was hoping to have

11:26.953 --> 11:29.787
a few words with...
Detective Murdoch.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.956
- Oh, right.

11:32.024 --> 11:35.326
- Allen Templeton.
- Yes, of course.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.395
Thank you for your support.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.263
It means a great deal to me.

11:39.266 --> 11:41.599
- It's my pleasure, Detective.

11:41.668 --> 11:44.202
- You do realize
that endorsing me

11:44.204 --> 11:46.137
for this position will use

11:46.206 --> 11:48.673
some of your political capital?

11:48.742 --> 11:50.742
- On balance, I expect it to be

11:50.810 --> 11:52.643
a worthy expenditure.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.146
The Catholic constituency is
rising in influence.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.014
I'll make sure that they know

11:57.017 --> 11:59.617
that I supported their man
for this prestigious position.

11:59.686 --> 12:04.655
- I am to be a pawn, then?
- Hardly.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.791
I see great things for you,
Detective Murdoch.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.632

the first to know...

12:14.701 --> 12:17.301
I've handed in my resignation
as City Coroner.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.371
- You've decided to become
a surgeon full time.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.641
- Yes, I plan to dedicate myself
to that alone.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.710
- Good for you.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.580
You do seem to be going
from success to success.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.015
- I don't want you to worry
about your position here.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.251
I will put in a good word
for the new coroner.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.853
- I appreciate that, Dr. Ogden.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.989
But you must be aware
I don't want to work

12:38.057 --> 12:39.857
for a new coroner.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.726
I want that job for myself.

12:43.896 --> 12:46.731
- Your ambition is admirable,
Miss Hart.

12:46.800 --> 12:50.234
And perhaps with a few more
years' experience...

12:50.303 --> 12:53.538
and hopefully down the road,
when minds are more open,

12:53.540 --> 12:56.240
you will earn
the position you want.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.677

such a reliable assistant

- I'll see what I can do.

14:10.182 --> 14:12.450

to change the world.

quite soon, Constable.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.035
You wanted to see me?
- Indeed.

15:04.103 --> 15:06.003
I need your help.
I heard that you are

15:06.072 --> 15:07.972
keeping company
with Isabel Carmichael?

15:08.040 --> 15:10.875
- Yes, I met her in an acting
class I've been attending.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.911
- Acting? You need

15:12.979 --> 15:14.812
to take a class in pretending?

15:14.814 --> 15:18.049
- Well... I--
- Never mind.

15:18.117 --> 15:20.818
Isabel was an acquaintance
of Lucille Palmer,

15:20.887 --> 15:24.021
recently deceased. Is that true?
- Yes. They were close friends.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.457
- Then, you knew her?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.592
- I, uh, yes...

15:28.661 --> 15:31.162
- Did you hear
that she fell into drugs?

15:31.230 --> 15:35.433
- I heard she had become
interested in opium.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.737
- I want you to look
into this for me, John.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.572
Unofficially, you understand.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.441
Get your lady friend talking.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.077
Find out who Miss Palmer was
keeping company with,

15:46.145 --> 15:48.112
who may have wanted to hurt her.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.681
But don't let Isabel
know why you're asking.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.417
- You want me to...
to lie to Isabel?

15:53.486 --> 15:56.587
- Let us not
think of it as a lie

15:56.655 --> 16:00.057
but as an exercise

16:00.126 --> 16:02.093
in... pretending.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.331
- Your monologue today was
very poised.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.333
- Thank you, John.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.336
I asked Miss Connors if we could

16:11.404 --> 16:13.404
do a scene together
next week in class.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.674
- I'd like that.
Maybe something from a tragedy?

16:16.743 --> 16:20.311
- I think I've had enough
tragedy for the time being.

16:20.379 --> 16:23.047
- Yes, of course.

16:23.115 --> 16:25.049
Sorry.

16:25.117 --> 16:26.984
Lucille?

16:27.053 --> 16:29.487
- If only you'd known her.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.389
She was so charming,

16:31.457 --> 16:34.225
but... she changed.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.460
- Changed how?

16:36.529 --> 16:38.462
Had she been associating
with the wrong people?

16:38.531 --> 16:42.033
- I tried to counsel her,
but she wouldn't listen to me.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.835
All of us tried to help.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.703
Her friends,

16:45.772 --> 16:47.571
Arthur...

16:47.640 --> 16:50.641
Arthur!
- Hello, sis.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.643
John.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.912
Ugh. You should have
ordered the deviled crabs.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.615
- Arthur, mind your manners
for heaven's sake.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.985
Excuse him,
he's utterly spoiled.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.821
- What are the riveting events
of the day

17:03.889 --> 17:05.790
you and your young constable
are discussing?

17:05.792 --> 17:08.059
- Lucille...

17:08.127 --> 17:10.127
and what happened to her.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.096
- I see.

17:12.164 --> 17:15.533
She certainly is a topic
of conversation isn't she, John?

17:15.601 --> 17:17.268
(ominous music)

17:17.336 --> 17:20.271
- I'm to meet
with the Board tonight.

17:20.339 --> 17:23.507
- You'll do fine.

17:23.576 --> 17:27.378
- If I'm honest, I'm a tad more
nervous than I thought I'd be.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.417
Is everything all right, sir?

17:32.485 --> 17:35.119
- Margaret's asked me
to give her a divorce.

17:35.187 --> 17:38.556
- Oh, I didn't realize

17:38.624 --> 17:41.025
it had come to that.
I'm so sorry.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.061
- Neither had I.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.833
- I have to go.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.902
- I hope you get
what you want, Murdoch.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.372
- Sir.

18:03.149 --> 18:05.783
- You're late for night rounds,
Doctor. Still working

18:05.851 --> 18:08.652
two jobs, are we?
- No, Dr. Dixon.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.689
I believe I have
found my calling.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.825
From now on, I am a surgeon.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.331
(door creaking)
- Ahem.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.335
(mechanical whirring)

18:34.013 --> 18:35.780
(door creaking)

18:39.218 --> 18:41.218
- Lately, Lucille was keeping
time with this fellow

18:41.221 --> 18:43.754
Grant Sutton. All four grew up
in the same circles.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.589
Isabel and Arthur believe
that Sutton was the one

18:45.658 --> 18:47.625
who encouraged her
to start taking opium.

18:47.627 --> 18:50.361
- Did this Sutton character have
any reason to want her dead?

18:50.363 --> 18:52.396
- Isabel's brother didn't know
anything about that...

18:52.464 --> 18:54.665
though I do believe
Sutton has a history

18:54.733 --> 18:57.034
of being rough
with his lady companions.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.104
- And you say Lucille had
fallen out with her old friends?

19:00.172 --> 19:03.240
- Yes.
- Then perhaps Grant Sutton was

19:03.309 --> 19:05.576
one of the last
to see her alive.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.711
It might be interesting
to find out what he knows.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.547
Don't dally.

19:13.018 --> 19:16.987
- Of course, I know
Detective Murdoch very well.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.557
- Your reputation
precedes you, Detective.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.560
- You arrested my good friend
Robert Graham last year.

19:22.628 --> 19:25.196
- Well, then. Nothing better
than having an incorruptible

19:25.264 --> 19:27.198
inspector on the team, is there?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.603

19:37.276 --> 19:39.176

20:42.175 --> 20:43.274

He'll need surgery. Notify
Dr. Forbes immediately.

Have them prepare
the operating theatre.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.416
of the blood
on the interior wall.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.352

20:54.354 --> 20:56.353
- Be grateful he has one.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.556
- Is he alive?!
- For now.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.691

to stay out of the way.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.761
Let's move him!
- Will he be all right?

21:03.830 --> 21:05.696
Will he be all right?
- He's been shot in the abdomen.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.964
- He's lost a lot of blood,
but he's hanging on.

21:08.001 --> 21:09.966

- We'll need to

21:10.003 --> 21:13.237
take the bullet out.
- Dr. Forbes is on his way.
- He's on his way?!

21:13.372 --> 21:15.239
- He has the experience.
- How many gunshot wounds has

21:15.374 --> 21:18.242
he seen? I've seen thousands!
- Dead ones, I presume, and
don't forget the bullet

21:18.244 --> 21:21.512
threatens the spine.
- Please, do what you can.

It'll be all right. I promise.
I promise you.

One... two.

- There it is.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.226
- Is it in the spinal cord?

24:24.230 --> 24:26.964
- I can't see how deep it goes.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.636
Do I take it out?
- I think we have to.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.975
Steady now. Steady.

24:47.320 --> 24:48.986
(Dr. Ogden exhaling audibly)

24:50.389 --> 24:53.557
Was there damage to
the spinal cord?
- I don't know.

24:56.595 --> 24:58.562
Let's get ready to close.

25:03.736 --> 25:06.202
- You didn't want him
to become a police officer.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.605
You were right.
I should have listened to you.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.408
About this and a lot
of other things.

25:11.410 --> 25:14.678
- Is he all right?

25:14.747 --> 25:17.213
- We were able to repair
the damage to the abdomen,

25:17.250 --> 25:19.483
but his recovery
will not be easy.

25:19.485 --> 25:22.152
- But he will live?

25:22.154 --> 25:25.089
- Yes. Yes, he will live.
- Thank God.

25:25.091 --> 25:27.424
- There's one more thing.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.495
The bullet was lodged
dangerously close to
his spinal cord.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.697
- Are you saying
that he may not walk again?

25:33.766 --> 25:36.633
- The swelling made it
impossible to know

25:36.702 --> 25:39.103
whether there will be
any permanent damage, but...

25:39.105 --> 25:41.171
we managed to get
the bullet out,

25:41.240 --> 25:44.041
and now we must
hope for the best.

25:44.110 --> 25:46.143
(soft music)

25:54.987 --> 25:56.854
- Miss Hart.
- Detective.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.191
- Grant Sutton.

26:02.394 --> 26:04.795
- What do you want, Murdoch?

26:04.863 --> 26:08.498
- Why are you moving the body?
- Because it's my case.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.734
- I'll be wanting
to take a look at that weapon.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.236
- That will be going into
evidence at my Station House.

26:13.305 --> 26:17.140
- One of our men was shot.
- In the district of
Station House One.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.376
And your man was shot
while interfering with a case

26:19.444 --> 26:21.345
I was working.
- Oh?

26:21.413 --> 26:23.213
It's my understanding
that you weren't working

26:23.281 --> 26:25.248
on the case at all.
- How do you come to that?

26:25.317 --> 26:28.251
- If Grant Sutton was willing
to shoot at a police officer,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.954
it would certainly suggest
that he had some involvement

26:31.023 --> 26:32.823
in Lucille Palmer's murder,
wouldn't it?

26:32.891 --> 26:35.159
- You are making
a leap, Detective.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.328
- Oh? Do you know otherwise?

26:37.396 --> 26:39.496
Had you previously
interviewed Grant Sutton?

26:39.498 --> 26:43.166
Now that one of our own
has been injured,

26:43.169 --> 26:45.168
I trust this case

26:45.237 --> 26:47.705
and Lucille Palmer's murder will
have your full attention.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.641
They will have mine.

26:52.744 --> 26:55.646
(ominous music)

26:55.714 --> 26:58.115
- These are all the notes
in Watts' things I could find

26:58.183 --> 27:00.450
that seem to pertain
to Lucille Palmer's death.

27:00.519 --> 27:02.452
- He hasn't come in yet?
- No.

27:02.455 --> 27:05.589
The notes seem to suggest

27:05.658 --> 27:07.457
that Grant Sutton was

27:07.460 --> 27:09.259
Miss Palmer's latest paramour.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.262
- That's why Watts and John went
looking for him.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.197
- Perhaps he was
her killer also, sir.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.500
I mean, maybe that's why he
shot John, thinking the police

27:16.568 --> 27:18.502
were coming to question him.
- That's certainly

27:18.570 --> 27:20.704
a possibility.

27:20.772 --> 27:23.440
But George, have a look at this.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.778
- "Mr. Sutton, Montreal,

27:27.846 --> 27:30.747
"October 28, 3 days.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.017
Alibi, question mark."

27:33.085 --> 27:35.318
This would imply that
Sutton was in Montreal

27:35.387 --> 27:37.154
at the time
of Miss Palmer's death.

27:37.222 --> 27:39.089
- And if that's the case, what
reason could he possibly have

27:39.157 --> 27:41.091
for shooting John?

27:41.093 --> 27:43.260
- I'll look into this.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.530
(soft music)

27:49.368 --> 27:51.802
- John?

27:51.870 --> 27:55.372
Oh, my baby boy!
- You're all right, son.

27:55.441 --> 27:58.242
- Detective Watts.
Is he all right?

27:58.310 --> 28:00.577
- He's fine.
(footsteps)

28:00.646 --> 28:02.879
- John!
- Isabel!

28:02.948 --> 28:06.083
- Oh, my God. John.
Thank goodness.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.821
- Mother, Father,

28:10.889 --> 28:13.257
this is Isabel Carmichael.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.992
- I had hoped we'd meet
under better circumstances.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.062
Are you all right?

28:18.130 --> 28:20.931
- Well, I suppose.
Though my legs feel strange.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.400
- That's normal.

28:23.469 --> 28:25.135
- You'll be as good as gold
before you know it.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.437
- I'm sorry I wasn't
here sooner. I was on the train

28:27.506 --> 28:29.673
to Hamilton and came back as
soon as I heard what'd happened.

28:29.675 --> 28:32.009
- I feel better already,
seeing your face.

28:32.077 --> 28:34.011
- Margaret.
- What?

28:34.079 --> 28:35.112
- Margaret, come on.
- What?

28:35.180 --> 28:38.515
- Come on.
(Margaret sighing)

28:38.583 --> 28:42.052
- Wait. Careful.

28:42.120 --> 28:44.822
- Where are you going?

28:44.890 --> 28:47.557
- I'm going to find Dr. Ogden.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.493
You heard him. There's something
wrong with his legs.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.662
- Oh, no! He's fine.
Who is this girl?

28:52.731 --> 28:55.365
- I don't know any more
than you do, Margaret.

28:55.433 --> 28:58.268
- Well you've been doing
a fine job as a father.

28:58.336 --> 29:00.104
They're acting like
they're practically engaged

29:00.172 --> 29:03.373
and you don't know who she is.
- I'm not the one who ran out

29:03.375 --> 29:05.476
on my family for two months.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.082
(sentimental music)

29:16.322 --> 29:19.256
- Here?
- Nothing. Is that normal?

29:19.324 --> 29:22.893
- We're giving the swelling
time to go down, John,

29:22.895 --> 29:25.395
before we draw any conclusions.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.264
- When will that be?

29:27.266 --> 29:29.166
- I'll be back.

29:29.234 --> 29:31.001
Ahem.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.210
- Doctor!

29:40.212 --> 29:44.047
So, will he walk?

29:44.115 --> 29:47.084
- It's only been a day.
- That's not an answer.

29:47.152 --> 29:50.620
- It's too soon to tell, Tom.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.690
- You should have waited.
- I thought you--

29:53.758 --> 29:56.927
- You should have waited
for someone who knows how
to do the bloody job!

30:00.432 --> 30:02.499
(sighing)

30:02.501 --> 30:04.568
- The man is upset.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.803
- Well, he has a right to be.

30:06.872 --> 30:08.772
John Brackenreid is not

30:08.841 --> 30:10.841
reporting sensation in his legs.

30:10.909 --> 30:14.077
- Oh. That's...

30:14.145 --> 30:16.580
That's unfortunate.
- You know as well as I do...

30:16.648 --> 30:19.850
that if his spine was intact,
he'd be showing signs by now.

30:19.918 --> 30:22.886
I may have paralysed him.
- Doctor...

30:30.062 --> 30:32.796
- Ladies.

30:32.798 --> 30:36.433
Might I have a word
with Constable Brackenreid?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.902
- Let's step outside,
Miss Carmichael.

30:38.970 --> 30:41.271
We can have a little chat
while the men talk.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.314
- John. Happy to see
you're on the mend.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.516
- I'll be up and about
in no time, Detective.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.519
- Good, good.

30:58.890 --> 31:01.658
What happened, John?
- Well, uh...

31:01.726 --> 31:04.428
Detective Watts wanted
to interview Grant Sutton,

31:04.496 --> 31:07.831
so we went inside. I heard
footsteps, called his name.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.101
That's all I remember.
- You must have been shot

31:11.169 --> 31:13.036
soon afterwards. And you don't

31:13.105 --> 31:15.839
recall if Mr. Sutton
or you shot first?

31:15.907 --> 31:19.175
- He must have.
But I can't say for sure.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.778
- Did you have your weapon drawn

31:21.780 --> 31:23.980
when you entered the room?
- Yes, I drew

31:23.983 --> 31:26.049
my gun the moment I--

31:26.051 --> 31:28.652
- Detective Watts never signed
any weapons out of the armoury.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.954
How is it that you were armed
and he wasn't?

31:38.330 --> 31:41.198
You are speaking to someone
who is on your side here, John.

31:44.469 --> 31:47.070
- The truth is...

31:47.139 --> 31:49.439
I knew of Grant Sutton
before we went to talk to him.

31:49.507 --> 31:51.541
He was a former beau
of Isabel's.

31:51.610 --> 31:54.344
She's a girl I'm seeing,
Isabel Carmichael.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.415
- Why would you need a weapon?

32:00.352 --> 32:03.887
- Grant Sutton is not a good
man. He'd been following her.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.423
He made threats against us both.

32:06.425 --> 32:08.558
She was frightened.

32:08.626 --> 32:11.027
I wanted to protect her.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.497
- And yet you told
Detective Watts none of this?

32:13.565 --> 32:15.565
- She begged me
not to tell anyone.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.467
She feared for her reputation.
So I...

32:17.535 --> 32:19.469
I kept quiet.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.007
- All right.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.777
- Detective...

32:27.846 --> 32:30.413
what happened to Grant Sutton?

32:30.482 --> 32:33.350
- He was shot... dead.

32:36.588 --> 32:40.123
- Well that's as well.
Isabel is safe now.

32:44.396 --> 32:46.596
I'm sorry, Detective.

32:48.733 --> 32:50.534
I did everything wrong,
didn't I?

32:50.602 --> 32:52.736
- It's all right, John.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.571
We'll... sort it out.

32:59.745 --> 33:02.012
- Why?

33:02.014 --> 33:04.948
Why would John not tell Watts

33:05.017 --> 33:06.816
that he knew about Grant Sutton?

33:06.885 --> 33:09.886
- He believed he was protecting
Isabel Carmichael's reputation.

33:09.955 --> 33:13.023
But as it turns out, Grant
Sutton didn't kill Miss Palmer.

33:13.091 --> 33:16.926
- Right. Witnesses place him
in Montreal at the time.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.895
Which begs the question,
why would he

33:18.897 --> 33:21.898
open fire on police
when they show up? Is he...

33:21.967 --> 33:24.467
Is he protecting
the real killer?

33:24.536 --> 33:26.503
- McWorthy doesn't believe
that there's any connection

33:26.571 --> 33:28.405
between Lucille Palmer
and her killer.

33:28.473 --> 33:30.240
- What if he's right?

33:30.308 --> 33:33.377
What if McWorthy is right
and Watts is wrong?

33:33.445 --> 33:35.412
There's no wonder
he's feeling responsible.

33:35.480 --> 33:37.647
- Actually...

33:37.715 --> 33:40.250
Detective Watts may have had
a reason to be suspicious.

33:40.318 --> 33:43.820
(suspenseful music)

33:50.596 --> 33:53.430
- Lucille Palmer was with child

33:53.498 --> 33:55.331
and intended for the father
to marry her.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.802
"No matter the difficulty
of the match",

33:58.870 --> 34:02.072
which means that
this someone was unsuitable.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.807
This could have been
the killer's motive.

34:03.875 --> 34:05.742
- Where did you find that?
- In the girl's bedroom.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.944
Which you would have known if
you had done a thorough search.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.913
- Why would you go back
into a room that had

34:09.981 --> 34:11.981
already been searched?
- Because, as I told you,

34:12.050 --> 34:13.983
I intend to look
into this matter further,

34:14.052 --> 34:15.885
whether you like it or not.

34:15.954 --> 34:18.688
Sometimes it pays
to take a second look.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.791
- Well, if you'd been looking
hard enough, you would know

34:21.860 --> 34:24.428
that Lucille Palmer wasn't
actually with child.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.763
The post-mortem showed that.

34:26.832 --> 34:29.466
- The man in question would have
no way of knowing that.

34:29.534 --> 34:32.369
Do you have any idea
who he may be?

34:34.773 --> 34:36.639
- But we may be able
to find out.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.042
I just spoke
with Lucille Palmer's sister.

34:39.111 --> 34:41.010
Her parents forbid her
from seeing Lucille,

34:41.079 --> 34:42.979
but she did anyway.

34:42.981 --> 34:45.014
- Did she know who Lucille
may have been seeing?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.050
- No, but she says her sister

34:47.052 --> 34:50.120
met the same man every Wednesday
at a posh downtown hotel.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.055
Including the Wednesday
before she died.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.424
- Who was he?

34:54.492 --> 34:56.392
- A man by the name
of Carmichael.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.761
- Carmichael.
- Arthur Carmichael.

34:58.764 --> 35:00.730
- Isabel Carmichael's brother.

35:00.799 --> 35:04.267
- Mm-hmm.
-<i> Of course I knew Lucille.</i>

35:04.269 --> 35:06.269
She was my sister's
closest chum.

35:06.337 --> 35:08.271
- Can anyone account

35:08.273 --> 35:10.540
for your whereabouts
on the evening that she died?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.742
- I can't think of anyone.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.611
- And you're a regular at
the Kings Arms Hotel downtown?

35:14.679 --> 35:16.413
- It's a first-rate hotel.

35:16.481 --> 35:19.015
You should really visit the bar
and try their gin rickey.

35:19.017 --> 35:20.951
Best in town.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.420
- This is a murder
investigation, Mr. Carmichael.

35:23.488 --> 35:26.022
You can keep
your drink tips to yourself.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.891
We believe you consorted

35:27.893 --> 35:29.792
with Miss Palmer.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.195
Did you ever consider
making an honest woman of her?

35:32.263 --> 35:35.298
(scoffing)
- Why would I do that?

35:35.300 --> 35:37.433
- For a start, it would be
the honourable thing.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.969
- I'm much too young
to be tied down.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.572
- So...

35:42.641 --> 35:44.574
you would be unhappy

35:44.576 --> 35:46.409
to receive this, then.

35:50.081 --> 35:51.915
- This isn't addressed to me.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.917
It just says, "My darling".

35:53.985 --> 35:55.752
I don't know
if you know about Lucille,

35:55.820 --> 35:58.888
but that could be anyone.
- You admit knowing her,

35:58.957 --> 36:00.890
and you admit meeting her
at that hotel.

36:00.959 --> 36:03.059
- You didn't want
to be tied down by her,

36:03.127 --> 36:05.461
so you took care of the problem.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.031
- She took care of it herself
by going and getting killed.

36:08.099 --> 36:12.235
- Wipe that smirk off your face,
or I will do it for you.

36:12.303 --> 36:14.337
- Are you going to let him
talk to me like that?

36:14.339 --> 36:16.773
- Just answer the questions.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.543
- In any event, I didn't
get her in the family way,

36:20.612 --> 36:22.345
and I didn't kill her.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.414
You can't prove otherwise.

36:26.818 --> 36:29.286
(soft music)

36:38.130 --> 36:40.430
- Did you speak with him?

36:40.498 --> 36:43.700
- To ask for the kind
of forgiveness I need

36:43.768 --> 36:45.535
is to place another burden
on him.

36:45.603 --> 36:47.437
- You didn't fail him.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.339
I did.

36:49.407 --> 36:51.574
- Your misplaced guilt

36:51.577 --> 36:53.776
is yet another consequence
of my mistakes.

36:53.779 --> 36:55.745
- I could say the same.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.647
- And yet,

36:57.715 --> 36:59.516
look at us.

36:59.584 --> 37:02.852
We are unscathed.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.567
(thunder rumbling)

37:22.274 --> 37:24.975
(thunder crashing)

37:27.145 --> 37:29.079
- (man): Thank you for coming,
Miss Hart.

37:29.147 --> 37:31.481
- I understand you can help me.

37:31.549 --> 37:34.917
- You want very much
to become city coroner.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.886
- I do.
The position is available,

37:36.955 --> 37:39.088
and I am the most qualified
to fill it.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.357
- I am prepared to help
you get what you want,

37:41.426 --> 37:43.159
but I need to know...

37:43.228 --> 37:46.496
will you help me?
- That's why I'm here.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.965
- Tomorrow you'll be asked

37:49.033 --> 37:51.100
to re-examine
Lucille Palmer's body,

37:51.103 --> 37:53.236
and you will find this.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.740
- I don't know what you've been
told about me, but I don't

37:57.809 --> 38:00.043
fabricate evidence.
- What I have been told

38:00.111 --> 38:02.545
is that you are ambitious.

38:02.613 --> 38:04.781
This is the opportunity

38:04.849 --> 38:06.916
to get what you want.

38:06.918 --> 38:09.719
(thunder crashing)

38:21.466 --> 38:24.000
- Detective, I have some

38:24.002 --> 38:27.236
- Station House One have done
another search of the scene

38:27.305 --> 38:29.105
of Miss Palmer's murder.

38:29.173 --> 38:31.974
They say they now have
the bullet that killed her.

38:32.043 --> 38:34.610
- Really?

38:34.613 --> 38:37.847
Does that strike you
as somewhat suspicious?

38:37.915 --> 38:39.749
- Somewhat indeed.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.419
- I would very much like
to see this bullet.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.757
How is it possible
that this was only just found?

38:47.826 --> 38:49.759
- Sometimes it pays
to have a second look.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.996
To be honest,
I'm skeptical myself.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.966
I'd been over that room three
times before with my best men.

38:57.034 --> 39:00.036
- Where exactly was it found?
- Embedded in the mattress.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.305
And there's something
interesting about it.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.174
Look.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.650
- Well, that is interesting.
- There's a fragment

39:13.718 --> 39:15.518
broken off it.
- And it wasn't found

39:15.586 --> 39:17.520
in the bed.
- It's unlikely

39:17.589 --> 39:19.656
the bullet would have broken
hitting the mattress.

39:19.724 --> 39:22.725
If this is indeed the bullet
that killed Lucille Palmer,

39:22.794 --> 39:25.128
then the missing piece could be
in her body.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.897
- If there were
something here, Detective,

39:27.966 --> 39:29.899
I would have found it during
my first examination.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.934
- Keep looking, Miss Hart.

39:31.937 --> 39:34.771
- So far, nothing.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.006
- The piece we're
looking for is small,

39:37.075 --> 39:39.041
thin and may be
very difficult to see.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.645
Please, keep looking.
- This is a waste of time.

39:44.950 --> 39:47.016
- Wait.

39:49.020 --> 39:53.389
Is this what you're looking for?

39:56.361 --> 39:58.761
- This is the bullet
that killed Lucille Palmer.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.164
- Now, all we have to do is find
the gun that fired it.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.701
- I consider Arthur Carmichael
to be our prime suspect

40:04.769 --> 40:07.370
at this time. Would you agree?

40:07.438 --> 40:09.639
- Let's search his home.

40:09.707 --> 40:11.707
- I don't even own a gun,
gentlemen.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.843
And if I had shot someone,
I'd hardly be

40:13.845 --> 40:16.913
stupid enough to bring
the very weapon home.

40:16.981 --> 40:18.915
- Oh, but I think
you just might be.

40:18.983 --> 40:21.184
- Do you know my father is
the chief crown attorney?

40:21.252 --> 40:23.386
- That's not my concern,
Mr. Carmichael.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.188
- Why don't you look
at the other fellow she was

40:25.256 --> 40:27.757
keeping company with?
- Who is that?

40:27.825 --> 40:29.659
- You'll be able
to find him easily enough.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.828
I hear he's not going anywhere.

40:31.896 --> 40:35.264
- Just tell us who he is.
- That constable my sister is

40:35.333 --> 40:37.066
so sweet on.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.202
John Brackenreid.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.707
(fast-paced music)

40:57.088 --> 40:59.756
- None of this makes
any sense to me.

40:59.824 --> 41:01.858
I never knew
John was carrying a gun.

41:01.926 --> 41:04.360
- He never mentioned
a relationship

41:04.362 --> 41:06.762
with Lucille Palmer?
- Only that he had met her

41:06.831 --> 41:09.032
briefly in his acting class.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.901
- Yet, Arthur Carmichael said
that John had

41:11.903 --> 41:14.237
an intimate relationship
with her.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.373
- Were John not known to us, we
would find this very suspicious.

41:17.441 --> 41:19.909
He did not outright lie

41:19.911 --> 41:22.078
about the gun
or the girl, but...

41:22.146 --> 41:24.947
- He left out
important truths, Watts.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.849
- And then apparently
killed Grant Sutton.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.051
- A potential witness
in the matter

41:29.054 --> 41:31.320
of Lucille Palmer's death.

41:31.389 --> 41:34.257
- As I say,
if John were not known to us...

41:34.259 --> 41:36.726
But he is,

41:36.794 --> 41:39.596
and I believe him
incapable of malicious intent,

41:39.664 --> 41:41.564
let alone murder.
- I agree.

41:41.632 --> 41:43.933
- Good.

41:43.935 --> 41:47.336
- Let's hope
the evidence confirms it.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.205
You're expected back at work.

41:49.273 --> 41:51.174
Soon.

41:53.612 --> 41:55.912
(gun being cocked)

42:00.285 --> 42:03.286
(tense music)

42:10.995 --> 42:13.796
- My son is lying
in a hospital bed, paralysed,

42:13.864 --> 42:16.466
and you're telling me you're
investigating him? For what?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.834
- It appears the bullet
that killed Miss Palmer came

42:18.903 --> 42:21.304
from John's gun.
- Well that's a bloody mistake!

42:21.372 --> 42:23.106
He's not capable
of killing a girl.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.708
Why's he meant to have done it?
- Miss Palmer wrote a letter

42:25.777 --> 42:28.644
to someone saying she was with
child and demanding marriage.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.981
- And that someone is my son?
That boy is

42:32.050 --> 42:34.817
as pure as the driven snow.
This is ridiculous, Murdoch,

42:34.819 --> 42:37.019
and I can prove
as much right now.

42:37.088 --> 42:39.121
(door creaking)
John!

42:39.124 --> 42:42.325
Tell Detective Murdoch that you
had nothing to do with the
murder of Lucille Palmer.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.661
- Sir--
- SHUT UP, MURDOCH!

42:45.664 --> 42:47.863
Tell these two that you didn't
even know Lucille Palmer.

42:47.866 --> 42:49.899
That you certainly
never bedded her.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.535
- Thomas!
- Of course he didn't.

42:52.604 --> 42:55.438
- It was before we were
courting, Isabel. I promise.

42:55.506 --> 42:57.640
- You knew her?

42:57.642 --> 43:00.276
- I did.
- Why did you

43:00.345 --> 43:03.279
not tell Detective Watts?
- Would someone please tell me

43:03.348 --> 43:05.214
what is going on here?
- Son.

43:05.216 --> 43:08.484
Did you or did you not
bed that girl?

43:08.552 --> 43:10.820
- Are you interrogating
your own son, Thomas?

43:10.888 --> 43:14.023
- Margaret!
Be quiet, for God's sake!
- It didn't mean anything to me.

43:14.092 --> 43:16.058
I'm so sorry.

43:16.127 --> 43:18.761
- At this moment you don't mean
anything to me either.

43:18.829 --> 43:21.297
- Isabel!

43:21.366 --> 43:24.133
(ominous music)

43:24.201 --> 43:26.769
- Even if the letter is...
it doesn't mean that...

43:26.771 --> 43:30.039
- The bullet's a match, sir.
- Constable John Brack-
- No.

43:30.041 --> 43:33.710
I'll do this.
- NO! Thomas, stop this!
- John Brackenreid,

43:33.778 --> 43:36.746
you're under arrest for
the murder of Lucille Palmer.
