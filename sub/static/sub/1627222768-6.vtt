13:30.394 --> 13:31.520
but he was nothing.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.855
He was a placeholder.

I was consumed with work.

13:34.523 --> 13:36.859
I‐‐ I had affairs with married men

Now towards the sun,
and you come down gently.

Just hip level.
Gently come up, keep breathing.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.567

‐ Hmm. Wobbly.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.860
We have that in common.

15:46.196 --> 15:51.159
Masha, why are you pushing
this protocol so fast?

15:51.577 --> 15:54.872
‐ Because the time is now.
‐ Is it now or never?

15:56.290 --> 15:57.916
What are we, out of money?

15:57.916 --> 15:59.418

16:00.377 --> 16:03.297
‐ Well, I‐I know that this lawsuit

16:03.297 --> 16:06.091
was a big‐‐ pretty big drain.

16:15.893 --> 16:17.811
‐ That was you?
‐ Mm.

16:18.437 --> 16:20.189
It was actually kind of sweet.

16:20.856 --> 16:21.940
You actually‐‐

16:22.399 --> 16:24.693
[chuckles] You actually seemed
kind of mortal.

Giving in to temptation.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.923
[echoing]: Tony.

17:30.425 --> 17:31.635
Your buddy.

18:38.452 --> 18:40.287
‐ Oh, Leon.
ZOE: Dad?

18:41.330 --> 18:45.000
‐ Oh. Uh, it just, uh,
erupted out of me, huh?

18:45.000 --> 18:47.044
‐ It's normal, it's‐‐
that's a great thing.

18:47.044 --> 18:50.088
‐ That's not normal.
‐ [clapping hands] Wow. Okay.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.466
Mount St. Napoleon onwards.

18:52.466 --> 18:53.634

18:53.634 --> 18:54.885
NAPOLEON: Oh, perfect. Better than ever.

18:54.885 --> 18:57.513
Wow. Uh, maybe a little water. Yeah.

19:01.767 --> 19:03.685
‐ You're a pretty little thing.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.821
‐ Hey. What are you doing?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.032
Gallivanting off like that
without your buddy?

19:17.699 --> 19:18.659
‐ Sorry.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.995
‐ How's your head?
‐ I don't know.

19:21.995 --> 19:25.457
It's kind of‐‐
it feels like a puffy cloud...

19:25.457 --> 19:26.959
‐ Mm‐hm.
‐ ...little bit, you know,

19:26.959 --> 19:29.962
like a cumulus cloud,
pretty with a chance of rain.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.469
‐ Anyway, you shouldn't
really go off like that

19:37.469 --> 19:38.804
and stuff, you know.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.598
FRANCES: Oh, right.
Because of the buddy system.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.518
‐ Yeah.
‐ We're buddies.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.396
Right? You and me?

19:48.730 --> 19:49.690
‐ Yeah.

‐ What?
‐ What?

19:58.907 --> 20:00.659
‐ What'd you say?
‐ I didn't say anything.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.411
‐ You did, you just said,
"Oh my God. He's going in."

20:03.287 --> 20:05.497
‐ Did I say that out loud?
‐ Yeah.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.333
‐ [stammering] I thought it.

20:08.333 --> 20:11.670
I didn't think I said it out loud.

20:11.670 --> 20:14.006
These‐‐ oh, these mushrooms

20:15.465 --> 20:17.259
"Oh my God. He's going in."
What does that mean?

20:17.968 --> 20:19.303
‐ You had a‐‐

20:21.054 --> 20:25.184

like you were gonna kiss me.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.101
So...

20:28.061 --> 20:29.396
Were you thinking that?

20:30.147 --> 20:32.065
‐ Yeah, I mean, I was thinking it.

20:34.026 --> 20:34.943
‐ And?

20:36.069 --> 20:37.905
‐ I remembered that
everything I ever touch

20:37.905 --> 20:38.864
I hurt.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.783
Especially the people I love.

20:44.203 --> 20:45.704
I don't wanna do that to you, Frances.

20:45.704 --> 20:46.830
I don't wanna hurt you.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.582
‐ Is that why you didn't kiss me?

20:48.582 --> 20:50.000
‐ That and it would involve leaning

20:50.000 --> 20:51.335
and I don't think
I could do that right now.

20:51.335 --> 20:52.794
I'm pretty dizzy.
I'm afraid I'm gonna fall.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.796

20:54.796 --> 20:56.590
God, I've written this scene

20:58.926 --> 21:00.719
it's a very gimmicky scene, but‐‐

21:00.719 --> 21:02.262

about Paul for a second?

21:02.262 --> 21:03.639
‐ Yup.

21:03.639 --> 21:06.058
‐ Okay.
Full disclosure, I'm a terrible kisser.

21:06.058 --> 21:09.770

21:09.770 --> 21:10.938
‐ Just lay it on me.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.232
‐ I'm not gonna make the first move.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.025
‐ I'm gonna make the move.

21:15.025 --> 21:17.152
‐ Are you?
‐ Yeah. Here it comes.

21:58.193 --> 22:00.028

I can't even imagine

22:00.028 --> 22:02.281

22:04.741 --> 22:06.326

22:06.326 --> 22:07.828
You said you were gonna catch me.

22:07.828 --> 22:09.997

I have no upper body strength.

22:12.249 --> 22:13.792

22:13.792 --> 22:15.961

22:47.701 --> 22:49.536
It's just really
just a matter of perspective.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.246
It's, you know, trick of the mind

22:51.246 --> 22:53.332

you think you are is a story

NAPOLEON: Yeah, it was.

24:29.803 --> 24:32.556
What I said, do you ever think
about not going on?

24:33.765 --> 24:37.936
‐ Jesus, that's, um, a bit of a buzzkill.

the bottom‐bottom.

25:03.545 --> 25:07.007
And Lars said that thing about
her picking us.

25:08.258 --> 25:13.013
And Masha made that comment
about desperate people that‐‐

25:13.680 --> 25:16.725
I mean, Frances, she picked nine people

25:16.725 --> 25:18.560
who needed to be in a place

25:19.269 --> 25:21.355
where they would try anything she wanted.

25:23.482 --> 25:26.360
I mean, every one of us
drank the Kool‐Aid this morning.

25:26.360 --> 25:27.694
Every one of us.

25:29.071 --> 25:31.573
Except this morning,
I didn't drink out of despair.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.033
I drank out of hope.

25:34.493 --> 25:36.453
Because of what she's already given me.

25:38.497 --> 25:40.832
Because of what you've given me, Frances.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.545
When I woke up this morning,

25:44.545 --> 25:46.547
this morning,
you know what I thought about?

25:48.715 --> 25:49.967
Painting my house.

25:53.136 --> 25:54.680
Maybe getting a dog.

25:57.224 --> 25:59.226
Definitely taking you out to dinner.

26:02.437 --> 26:03.730
That was, um...

26:08.235 --> 26:10.404
If I ever do write romance again,

26:12.406 --> 26:13.949
I'm gonna steal that.

26:25.252 --> 26:29.506
‐ So you're basically stalking her?

26:29.756 --> 26:32.968
‐ Well, in a way.
I don't know, studying her.

26:33.677 --> 26:37.181
I mean, I just‐‐
I came with a lot of hate.

26:37.556 --> 26:40.058
Like she was the reason
that I lost my family

26:40.058 --> 26:42.102
or at least the precipitating
factor which...

26:43.353 --> 26:44.897
you know, it probably isn't true.

26:45.147 --> 26:47.065
I mean, in many ways, it's actually...

26:48.317 --> 26:50.986
just the opposite.
‐ What do you mean?

26:50.986 --> 26:52.654
CARMEL: I just feel like in many ways

26:52.654 --> 26:55.032
she's given us family.

26:55.032 --> 26:58.869
You know, you saw the way
we all were last night, dinner.

26:59.494 --> 27:02.247
We danced. [laughs]

'Cause should that happen to me,
I mean, that‐‐ that...

27:24.686 --> 27:27.981

I attacked my ex with a fork.

What if suddenly, I mean, I don't know,

27:30.692 --> 27:32.528

your partner, right?

I mean, do you ever get
any visions of him,

27:49.169 --> 27:50.462

27:51.421 --> 27:52.381
‐ No.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.427
‐ Wow, you are...

27:58.554 --> 28:00.013
lucky, I guess.

28:01.181 --> 28:02.140
‐ Maybe.

28:03.892 --> 28:04.852
Maybe not.

28:09.773 --> 28:12.150
‐ [exclaims] I knocked your camera over.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.151
‐ That's all right, we're done.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.987
‐ How do I look? Look at the tape.

28:14.987 --> 28:16.572
LARS: Beautiful.

‐ Of course, it was.

Nobody's just gonna steal your nose.

29:50.916 --> 29:52.251

29:52.251 --> 29:53.919
If somebody took it, it'd still be gone.

Hey, did you give us mushrooms?

30:10.853 --> 30:12.312
You was only supposed to give us E.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.982
‐ Yes, you specifically asked for it.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.777
‐ Well, not to make my nose
fall off of my face.

30:18.777 --> 30:20.821

30:20.821 --> 30:22.865
You're fine, look.

30:22.865 --> 30:25.075
BEN: Told you that.
‐ You're fine.

30:29.872 --> 30:31.832
‐ I told her it was still on her face.

30:32.332 --> 30:33.709
Hey, where she come from?

30:33.709 --> 30:34.877

32:37.666 --> 32:40.752
I saw him. I did. I saw him.

32:41.753 --> 32:43.839
‐ Oh, Zach, Zach?

32:43.839 --> 32:46.800
‐ Hey, Mom. What is with the shrooms?

32:47.634 --> 32:50.554
I guess the zero tolerance policy
is out the window or‐‐

32:51.013 --> 32:53.390
I mean, you should've told me,
I might've stuck around.

32:53.390 --> 32:58.187
‐ [laughs] I missed you so much.

32:58.187 --> 33:01.398
Oh, my God. Oh, I‐‐

33:02.149 --> 33:03.525
look at your face.

33:05.903 --> 33:07.154
Oh, come here.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.198
Oh!

33:10.157 --> 33:12.075
Look at you.

33:12.075 --> 33:13.869
‐ Honey?
ZOE: Shh.

33:13.869 --> 33:16.496
‐ What?
‐ I think she's with him.

33:16.496 --> 33:20.209
HEATHER: My boy. Oh, hello, my boy.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.002
Oh.

33:24.129 --> 33:26.298
I wanna believe this is real.

33:26.298 --> 33:28.675
Oh, please, let this be real.

33:28.675 --> 33:29.885
‐ I know.

33:31.470 --> 33:32.763
‐ [whispers] I love you.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.651
But I want you to tell me why.

33:46.443 --> 33:48.654
‐ You know why, Mom.

33:48.654 --> 33:52.366
‐ Oh, no, I don't. How could I?

33:52.366 --> 33:53.617
‐ How could you?

33:54.701 --> 33:57.079
It's kind of your job, don't you think?

33:57.621 --> 33:58.830
‐ My job?

33:59.706 --> 34:01.333
I don't know what you mean.

34:03.961 --> 34:05.128
Your asthma?

34:06.797 --> 34:08.215
You hung yourself.

34:08.924 --> 34:10.133
‐ The medication.

34:10.801 --> 34:13.887
‐ No, I‐‐ honey, I'm not following.

34:13.887 --> 34:15.514
I don't understand.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.141
ZACH: It was all listed.

34:18.141 --> 34:20.394
The side effects, you read the pamphlet.

34:21.270 --> 34:23.939
Side effects: blurry vision,
shortness of breath,

34:23.939 --> 34:26.567
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
nausea, blah, blah, blah, blah.

34:27.818 --> 34:29.778
Suicidal ideation.

34:30.445 --> 34:33.031
Ding, ding, ding, winner.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.952
‐ What do you mean suicidal ideation?

34:36.952 --> 34:38.620
ZACH: Mom, come on.

34:41.623 --> 34:43.041
You underlined it.

34:44.751 --> 34:45.919
Right there.

34:46.545 --> 34:49.131
‐ Oh. I didn't‐‐ [stammers]

34:51.216 --> 34:52.926
What are you talking about?

34:52.926 --> 34:55.470
I‐‐ No. I didn't‐‐

34:56.889 --> 35:02.769
Oh, no! No, I‐‐ No, I didn't know! No!

35:02.769 --> 35:05.772
No! No, no! No! No!

35:05.772 --> 35:07.858
‐ Mom?
‐ [screams] No! No! No!

35:07.858 --> 35:10.110
‐ Mom.
HEATHER: No, no!

35:10.110 --> 35:12.070
NAPOLEON: Honey, Heather calm down.

35:30.255 --> 35:31.507
DELILAH: Okay.

35:37.221 --> 35:39.556
DELILAH: You wanna get up?
Come on, let's get you up.

35:39.556 --> 35:41.683
Let's get you up. Come on.

36:01.787 --> 36:03.539
‐ Dad?
NAPOLEON: Yeah?

36:05.958 --> 36:08.252
‐ It's gonna be okay. She's gonna be okay.

36:08.252 --> 36:11.129
‐ Oh, yeah.
It's gonna be fine, sweetheart.

36:17.553 --> 36:20.973
YAO: Heather?
If you can follow the light

36:20.973 --> 36:22.182
with your eyes.

36:24.309 --> 36:26.103
All right, let's...

36:32.442 --> 36:35.487
‐ Where... Where has he gone?

36:35.487 --> 36:37.739
MASHA: It's okay.
‐ Where is my son?

36:39.825 --> 36:41.952
Where's my‐‐
‐ It's okay.

36:43.120 --> 36:44.288
Honey...

36:47.457 --> 36:48.542
‐ Where's my...

36:49.585 --> 36:52.296
MASHA: It's okay. It's okay.
‐ [Heather cries] No.

36:58.427 --> 36:59.428
No.

37:00.262 --> 37:02.723
Oh, no.
[sobbing continues]

37:03.682 --> 37:06.185
[screams]
‐ It's all right. It's okay.

37:08.604 --> 37:10.272
It's okay.

37:15.903 --> 37:19.072
YAO: It's gonna be okay.
Just a pinch, okay? Okay.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.991
It's all right.
‐ Look at me.

37:20.991 --> 37:22.784
Look at me.

37:23.619 --> 37:24.995
Rest. It's all right.

37:25.787 --> 37:27.039
It's all right, darling.

37:27.706 --> 37:29.458
Darling, it's all right.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.335
All right.

37:32.753 --> 37:33.712
All right.

37:36.298 --> 37:38.258
Napoleon, Zoe, come.

37:38.926 --> 37:41.303
She, uh, had another panic attack,

37:41.303 --> 37:44.806
but she has, uh, had a sedative
and she's resting.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.226
YAO: She'll be out for a couple of hours.

37:47.226 --> 37:49.811
NAPOLEON: Yeah? She's okay, though?
‐ She's gonna be fine.

37:50.270 --> 37:53.732
Absolutely fine.
Delilah, can you go check
on the others for me?

37:56.318 --> 37:57.778
‐ Masha?
‐ Mm‐hmm?

37:57.778 --> 37:59.905
‐ I think we're a little out
of our depths here.

37:59.905 --> 38:02.824
‐ Please D, please do this, yes,
thank you.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.076
NAPOLEON: Hey.

38:08.288 --> 38:09.873
‐ She was seeing Zach.

38:10.624 --> 38:12.584
‐ Yeah. Yeah, we all did.
ZOE: Yeah.

38:14.378 --> 38:16.713
‐ You all saw him?

38:16.713 --> 38:17.714
NAPOLEON: Yeah.

38:18.924 --> 38:20.425
‐ Zoe, you‐‐
‐ Yeah.

38:20.425 --> 38:23.053
Saw stuff I really wish I hadn't.

38:24.763 --> 38:28.058
‐ And you saw him as well?
‐ Yeah. He's a‐‐

38:28.058 --> 38:30.018
he was, kind of, flickering in and out,

38:30.018 --> 38:31.520
all static‐y.

38:31.520 --> 38:33.355
Heather's the one who saw him the most,

38:33.355 --> 38:36.608
it was like they were together
having a conversation.

38:39.486 --> 38:42.865
‐ What was the conversation about?

38:42.865 --> 38:45.284
‐ Um, we heard her say asthma

38:45.284 --> 38:47.661
and then something about his medication.

38:47.661 --> 38:51.373
‐ Suicidal ideation.
She said suicidal ideation.

38:51.373 --> 38:55.335
Zach had just started
a new asthma medication.

38:55.335 --> 38:57.087
Perhaps that was one of the side effects,

38:57.087 --> 38:59.464
I don't know.
I‐‐ I never read the pamphlet,

38:59.464 --> 39:00.632
but...

39:02.050 --> 39:03.135
she would have.

39:09.850 --> 39:10.809
‐ Dad?

39:11.685 --> 39:13.145
‐ I am sorry for this.

39:13.812 --> 39:15.397
But this needed to happen.

39:16.106 --> 39:18.650
She had to have this memory come back.

39:19.735 --> 39:20.694
It...

39:47.304 --> 39:50.474
‐ Oh. This feels so good.

39:51.683 --> 39:53.310
I'm usually a beach guy.

39:54.061 --> 39:55.646
It's Ray that loves the pool.

39:56.188 --> 39:59.858
‐ Oh. Is anybody else
still wearing their shoes?

40:01.360 --> 40:03.237
I still have my shoes on.

40:04.363 --> 40:06.406
TONY: She said no water.
FRANCES: No, no, no.

40:06.406 --> 40:09.660
The water is so nice, you'll love it.
JESSICA: It's fine.

40:09.660 --> 40:11.828
‐ No. This is dangerous.
She said no water.

40:11.828 --> 40:13.288
She was very specific.

40:14.164 --> 40:17.292
It feels overwhelming, dangerous.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.503
[pants] Oh, fuck.

40:19.503 --> 40:21.755
‐ No, it's‐‐ it's amazing in here.

40:21.755 --> 40:23.090
You'll love‐‐ you love the water.

40:23.090 --> 40:25.008
‐ I can't get out of this throne.

40:25.008 --> 40:27.094
‐ Where's Zoe? She'd love this.

40:27.094 --> 40:29.429
‐ Fuck.
‐ Hey, come on in.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.306
Come on in, it's so nice.

40:39.439 --> 40:40.566
TONY: Okay.

40:45.404 --> 40:46.405
Oh, yeah.

40:47.614 --> 40:50.075
Oh, yeah. Oh, you're right.

40:50.409 --> 40:51.368
It feels amazing.

40:51.368 --> 40:53.245
‐ See?

40:54.746 --> 40:56.039
‐ Water.

40:56.039 --> 40:57.332
Who knew?

41:00.627 --> 41:02.379
‐ Okay. Everybody, out of the pool.

41:02.379 --> 41:03.672
‐ Fuck! I told you!

41:05.132 --> 41:06.300
DELILAH: It's okay.

41:07.301 --> 41:09.052
Are you all staying hydrated?

41:09.052 --> 41:10.679
‐ Yes.
DELILAH: No, no, no.

41:10.679 --> 41:11.847
Not‐‐ Not that water, Ben.

41:11.847 --> 41:15.184
That's filled with magnesium,
potassium, and Himalayan salt.

41:15.184 --> 41:18.187
LARS: We're all together.
The Marconis should be here.

41:18.187 --> 41:19.938
‐ Oh yeah.
LARS: Yeah, right?

41:19.938 --> 41:22.357
‐ Yes. We must summon them.

41:22.357 --> 41:24.109
Can you summon them for us, please?

41:24.109 --> 41:25.694
‐ Not just now. Heather's, um,

41:25.694 --> 41:26.778
Heather's having a rest.

41:26.778 --> 41:28.030
LARS: What sort of rest?

41:28.030 --> 41:31.033
‐ Okay. Please, let's get you all up
to your rooms, okay?

41:31.825 --> 41:34.786
‐ That's right.
‐ Is‐‐ Is Heather okay, first?

41:34.786 --> 41:37.331
‐ She's fine. She's with Yao and Masha.

41:37.331 --> 41:38.665
‐ Okay.

41:41.043 --> 41:42.211
‐ Everybody out.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.765
LARS: Hey.
[gasps]

41:54.765 --> 41:56.767
‐ I'm sorry, just don't‐‐ don't‐‐

41:56.767 --> 41:58.894
don't touch me, I just‐‐
I don't like that.

41:58.894 --> 42:00.270
LARS: It's okay, Carmel.

42:01.563 --> 42:02.731
Come on.

42:02.731 --> 42:04.399
Let me take you to your room.

42:05.067 --> 42:06.944
Come on. It's okay.

42:06.944 --> 42:08.403
‐ Everybody out!

42:17.496 --> 42:18.789
ZACH: Hey!

42:32.219 --> 42:33.637
‐ What did you say to Mom?

42:34.721 --> 42:36.223
‐ Have you ever known me to lie?

42:36.223 --> 42:37.766
‐ Just answer my question, shithead.

42:37.766 --> 42:39.017
What did you say to her?

42:39.601 --> 42:41.645
‐ I can only tell people
what they already know.

42:43.272 --> 42:45.566
Like, I can tell you,

42:45.566 --> 42:48.151
you hurt, that you'll be okay.

43:00.664 --> 43:01.456
‐ Zach?

43:21.894 --> 43:23.395
MASHA: She's awake now.

43:24.396 --> 43:25.939
You can talk to her.

43:29.401 --> 43:32.571
‐ Frankly, I don't really know
what I would say.

43:39.328 --> 43:40.579
You know...

43:41.705 --> 43:44.499
couples rarely survive these things.

43:45.209 --> 43:47.169
These kind of tragedies.

43:50.964 --> 43:52.841
People's lives go on, but...

43:54.051 --> 43:55.177
not together.

43:55.636 --> 43:58.347
I've read everything there is
to read on the matter.

43:59.973 --> 44:02.893
The little bud of malignancy...

44:04.061 --> 44:05.270
is blame.

44:07.773 --> 44:10.025
When a child dies...

44:11.401 --> 44:13.570
and there's blame to be had...

44:16.907 --> 44:19.034
That's why I thought when, uh...

44:22.496 --> 44:24.206
When I thought it was me...

44:26.333 --> 44:27.876
‐ Hmm.
‐ When I'd overslept

44:27.876 --> 44:31.213
and I thought maybe
I could've made a difference.

44:32.297 --> 44:34.216
I was so afraid...

44:35.384 --> 44:38.178
that Heather would blame me and leave me.

44:38.178 --> 44:41.139
And I was convinced of it
because if the shoe

44:41.139 --> 44:43.684
were on the other foot,
I'd probably leave her.

44:43.684 --> 44:44.935
Who wouldn't?

44:46.895 --> 44:49.523
Well, you know what,
now the shoe's on the other foot.

44:53.068 --> 44:56.613
She scours the label of every food product

44:56.613 --> 44:58.824
before she puts a morsel in her mouth.

45:00.367 --> 45:04.788
God forbid she come in contact
with a bit of sugar or gluten.

45:07.875 --> 45:10.961
Either she read about the side effects

45:10.961 --> 45:14.006
in that pamphlet or she didn't.

45:17.009 --> 45:18.635
But either way...

45:18.635 --> 45:19.678
Hmm.

45:22.598 --> 45:25.100
I'm a pretty forgiving man. I've...

45:26.310 --> 45:29.188
I've had to learn to be, but, uh...

45:31.523 --> 45:34.026
Yeah. I don't think I can forgive that.

45:37.029 --> 45:38.947
‐ She's the love of your life.

45:39.573 --> 45:41.241
‐ It doesn't matter.

45:42.910 --> 45:44.328
It's not enough.

45:49.041 --> 45:52.669
‐ What do you want, Napoleon?

45:55.214 --> 45:56.798
What do you want...

45:57.382 --> 45:58.550
most?

46:03.847 --> 46:05.891
‐ I just want my son back.

46:11.438 --> 46:16.026
‐ Suppose I can arrange that.

46:19.988 --> 46:22.199
I'm not saying I can bring him
back for real,

46:22.199 --> 46:25.035
but I am saying
that reality is a perspective.

46:25.035 --> 46:27.371
‐ "Reality is a perspective."
MASHA: Mmm.

46:27.371 --> 46:29.122
‐ What does that even mean?

46:35.921 --> 46:37.840
I killed my son.

46:38.799 --> 46:41.343
‐ Oh, Heather. Heather...

46:41.343 --> 46:42.845
‐ I killed him.

46:48.767 --> 46:51.395
‐ And I am talking

46:51.395 --> 46:54.314
about bringing him back for you.

46:54.898 --> 46:56.817
‐ As a fucking hallucination.

46:56.817 --> 47:00.988
‐ Psychedelics can be used
to achieve an alternate reality.

47:00.988 --> 47:02.781
The science is here.

47:02.781 --> 47:06.410
And in that alternate reality,
Zachary can exist

47:07.244 --> 47:11.123
because what happened today
was incredible.

47:11.123 --> 47:13.750
All three of you saw Zachary.

47:13.750 --> 47:16.336
It's called shared psychosis
hallucination.

47:16.336 --> 47:20.132
It's‐‐ It's very rare. It's very powerful.

47:20.132 --> 47:22.259
There's usually a dominant player,

47:22.259 --> 47:23.760
a primary inducer.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.388
And there was, it was Zoe.

47:26.388 --> 47:28.056
‐ I don't know what you're saying.

47:29.099 --> 47:32.436
‐ If you let me guide you, help you...

47:34.313 --> 47:36.231
you can see Zachary

47:36.231 --> 47:40.903
and you can interact with him,
talk to him, you can.

47:40.903 --> 47:42.321
‐ Via psychedelics?

47:42.321 --> 47:44.031
MASHA: Yes.
‐ Right. Yeah.

47:44.031 --> 47:45.616
I'm sorry. That just sounds like madness.

47:45.616 --> 47:46.700
‐ But it's not madness.

47:46.700 --> 47:48.827
It's dangerous if it's not
managed correctly,

47:48.827 --> 47:51.038
but it is not madness.

47:51.038 --> 47:52.706
‐ This is why we're here.

47:54.166 --> 47:55.876
This is why you chose us.

47:57.377 --> 47:59.171
‐ Because I wanna help you.

48:01.715 --> 48:03.884
I don't want you to have this pain.

48:04.968 --> 48:07.554
Think of all the people that are living

48:07.554 --> 48:12.226
with this unbearable grief and pain.

48:12.226 --> 48:13.810
Think of it.

48:13.810 --> 48:15.395
If this works...

48:17.064 --> 48:19.024
imagine what we can offer them.

48:19.566 --> 48:21.652
Because what we can do
is we can offer them

48:21.652 --> 48:23.695
the chance to relieve past trauma.

48:23.695 --> 48:27.074
We can offer them the chance
to come to terms with it,

48:27.533 --> 48:29.576
to share those terms...

48:33.455 --> 48:35.832
with the object of their grief.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.502
Like Zachary for you.

48:39.253 --> 48:42.381
‐ Mm‐mm.
No. I go back to madness.

48:46.426 --> 48:47.761
‐ Heather.

48:47.761 --> 48:49.555
I know pain.

48:49.555 --> 48:50.764
I know it.

48:52.140 --> 48:54.184
And I also know healing.

48:54.893 --> 48:59.606
Put yourself in my hands
and under my care, my control.

49:00.190 --> 49:03.443
I will try to give you your son back.

49:25.716 --> 49:28.594
CARMEL: Well... you found my spot.

49:29.344 --> 49:32.139
‐ Guess that makes two of us
that had a wildly original idea.

49:32.139 --> 49:33.140
CARMEL: Yeah. [laughs]

49:34.683 --> 49:36.268
[sighs] Wow.

49:37.811 --> 49:39.396
A crazy day, huh?

49:39.897 --> 49:41.356
‐ Definitely strange.

49:41.356 --> 49:42.357
CARMEL: Yeah.

49:44.484 --> 49:45.736
How you doing?

49:46.820 --> 49:48.906
‐ Oh, you know.

49:50.365 --> 49:51.700
‐ I actually do.

49:58.582 --> 50:02.169
I think‐‐ I think we're a little alike.

50:03.712 --> 50:05.130
Yeah.

50:05.130 --> 50:09.426
Like when you had your vision
of your‐‐ your mini‐man.

50:12.471 --> 50:14.014
Like Masha said,

50:14.681 --> 50:18.644
the heart hurts, but our heads,

50:18.644 --> 50:20.229
you know, getting...

50:21.813 --> 50:23.815
played for fools.

50:26.777 --> 50:28.695
It‐‐ It‐‐ It's not so much

50:29.154 --> 50:31.740
that‐‐ that they stopped feeling...

50:32.950 --> 50:36.954
for us or‐‐ or that
they never felt that much

50:36.954 --> 50:38.205
to begin with.

50:39.122 --> 50:42.084
It is how they made us feel...

50:43.210 --> 50:44.586
about ourselves.

50:46.171 --> 50:48.131
‐ Have you noticed that...

50:49.633 --> 50:52.219
the other people are starting
to feel better,

50:53.136 --> 50:54.429
you know, in their own way.

50:55.472 --> 50:58.600
I mean, I think I'm even
somewhat improving,

50:58.600 --> 51:00.561
although incrementally.

51:05.440 --> 51:09.194
I just‐‐ I just worry that

51:09.611 --> 51:12.531
it seems like you may be getting worse.

51:17.703 --> 51:20.497
DELILAH: She is gonna try again
with the Marconis.

51:21.039 --> 51:22.374
YAO: How do you know?

51:22.374 --> 51:24.251
‐ I overheard them talking about it.

51:26.003 --> 51:28.881
Heather just had
a fully psychotic episode.

51:28.881 --> 51:33.010
They‐‐ They are in no position
to make that kind of decision.

51:33.802 --> 51:36.763
Set aside the legal exposure,
you saw what happened last time.

51:36.763 --> 51:38.307
It won't work.

51:38.307 --> 51:40.893
‐ It might. It almost did last time.

51:40.893 --> 51:41.935
‐ But it didn't.

51:43.312 --> 51:45.105
The Connollys are still stalking Masha.

51:45.105 --> 51:46.398
They're still threatening her.

51:46.398 --> 51:48.233
‐ We don't know that it's them.

51:48.233 --> 51:49.735
‐ Then who is threatening her?

51:55.449 --> 51:57.367
It is a huge risk.

51:57.367 --> 51:59.620
‐ It's the risk that we take.

52:00.245 --> 52:03.040
Look, I believe in what
we're building here.

52:03.040 --> 52:05.751
And you did once too, all right?

52:05.751 --> 52:07.252
The protocol got you well,

52:07.252 --> 52:08.921
it'll be the same for the Marconis.

52:08.921 --> 52:11.840
‐ This is not mindfulness or yoga or‐‐

52:11.840 --> 52:14.009
or even microdosing.

52:14.009 --> 52:15.260
I don't care.

52:16.345 --> 52:17.888
I don't want to be complicit in this.

52:17.888 --> 52:20.015
And I don't want you
to be complicit in this.

52:22.100 --> 52:23.810
We need to get out of here.
