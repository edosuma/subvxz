Subs created by: David Coleman.

00:05.658 --> 00:08.648
There's a lot of screaming.

00:08.649 --> 00:10.438
Secrets were buried.

00:10.439 --> 00:12.407
You can hear, like, an echo in the ground.

00:12.408 --> 00:13.675
The land is tainted.

00:13.676 --> 00:15.476
There's something right over my shoulder.

00:15.477 --> 00:17.545
He was like a tyrant.

00:17.546 --> 00:19.892
He liked to hang people.

00:19.893 --> 00:22.383
Definitely there were people
who died on this land.

00:22.384 --> 00:23.892
He was shot.

00:23.893 --> 00:24.970
I just see blood.

00:24.971 --> 00:27.106
He made a mistake and he
paid the ultimate price.

00:27.107 --> 00:30.388
Now they're gonna get her.

00:30.389 --> 00:33.329
Bad things happened.

00:35.208 --> 00:37.142
There's something down there.

00:37.143 --> 00:40.263
My name is Amy Allan.

00:41.107 --> 00:43.420
A lot of dead people are here.

00:43.421 --> 00:44.569
I see dead people.

00:44.570 --> 00:46.307
This is not good.

00:46.308 --> 00:48.286
I speak to dead people..

00:48.287 --> 00:49.952
He is very pissed off.

00:49.953 --> 00:51.562
And they speak to me..

00:51.563 --> 00:52.831
The house is angry.

00:52.832 --> 00:56.349
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.350 --> 00:58.067
He's killed people.

00:58.068 --> 00:59.655
I rely on my partner.

00:59.656 --> 01:00.933
I'm Steve Dischiavi.

01:00.934 --> 01:02.986
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective..

01:02.987 --> 01:04.402
He got shot at his house?

01:04.403 --> 01:07.439
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:07.440 --> 01:08.764
Aren't you terrified being here?

01:08.765 --> 01:09.990
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.991 --> 01:12.267
That sounds like something
out of "The Exorcist."

01:12.268 --> 01:14.384
But Steve and I never speak..

01:14.385 --> 01:16.334
We never communicate
during an investigation..

01:16.335 --> 01:17.721
Until the very end..

01:17.722 --> 01:19.005
It's bad.

01:19.006 --> 01:21.080
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay..

01:21.081 --> 01:22.442
I'd like some answers.

01:22.443 --> 01:25.443
Or time to get out.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074

01:52.304 --> 01:55.407
Amy and I conduct our
investigations separately.

02:02.025 --> 02:05.067
interview the witnesses, and
see if there's any correlation

02:05.068 --> 02:08.127
to Amy's experiences.

02:08.366 --> 02:10.407
We're down in Cartersville, Georgia.

02:10.408 --> 02:13.158
I got contacted by a woman named Cynthia,

02:13.159 --> 02:15.023
who just this year moved
into her dream house

02:15.024 --> 02:19.164
with her husband and her three boys.

02:19.406 --> 02:22.734
Problem is, they're starting to see
apparitions, they're hearing things,

02:22.735 --> 02:27.450
and there's stuff going
missing in the house.

02:27.451 --> 02:31.051
The whole family's terrified.

02:31.918 --> 02:37.818
So I'm going over there to meet her now,
see what I can find out about it.

02:52.125 --> 02:56.491
Before I get to a location,
I enter a meditative state.

02:56.492 --> 02:59.401
I call this opening because
it allows me to open up

02:59.402 --> 03:03.602
and receive information from the dead.

03:04.873 --> 03:07.242
There's this big guy.

03:07.243 --> 03:12.943
Like, he might be 6-foot, but,
like, he might be taller.

03:13.915 --> 03:16.675
He's a big guy.

03:20.766 --> 03:24.666
And he's standing by two graves.

03:26.995 --> 03:31.315
And then I could hear, like, screaming.

03:37.293 --> 03:39.453
Damn it.

03:49.351 --> 03:53.273
Before Amy enters a location, I
go in and either cover or remove

03:53.274 --> 03:56.792
anything that can influence her findings.

03:56.793 --> 04:00.056
This house is filled with
a lot of personal items,

04:00.057 --> 04:03.398
so it's important that I take
my time to remove everything.

04:03.399 --> 04:08.439
Once I clear the house,
Amy can begin her walk.

04:22.984 --> 04:25.564
They're upset.

04:28.696 --> 04:31.336
Who are "they"?

04:32.574 --> 04:35.274
The dead people.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.729
This is not good.

04:54.740 --> 04:56.759
Now, Cynthia, you said you were
in the house about five months.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.219
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, what happened

04:58.220 --> 05:00.367
that made you think there
was something wrong?

05:00.368 --> 05:05.639
Loud stomps in our bedroom,
women weeping, apparitions.

05:05.640 --> 05:09.810
Things that set the whole
house a little on edge.

05:09.811 --> 05:12.245
Now you gotta be frightened
for your kids, I would think.

05:12.246 --> 05:13.193
Definitely.

05:13.194 --> 05:18.474
We just wanna make sure
that everybody's okay here.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.373
When was the first time that something
unusual happened to you in the house?

05:24.374 --> 05:26.522
Right off the bat when I
started sleeping here,

05:26.523 --> 05:29.342
I realized I was hearing a child cry.

05:29.343 --> 05:31.282
It was just a very deep sob.

05:31.283 --> 05:36.383
It was loud enough to me
that it would wake me.

05:42.150 --> 05:45.194
There are young people.

05:45.195 --> 05:48.135
There were children.

05:49.915 --> 05:53.039
Seeing all these children.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.971
And they're running and
hiding, running and hiding,

05:55.972 --> 05:59.177
because they're afraid of something..

05:59.178 --> 06:01.514
Happening to them.

06:01.515 --> 06:07.415
They're running and hiding because they're
afraid that they're gonna get hurt.

06:11.402 --> 06:14.150
But you don't know by what?

06:14.151 --> 06:15.951
No.

06:20.879 --> 06:23.650
You explained on the phone about..

06:23.651 --> 06:25.144
Things missing in the house.

06:25.145 --> 06:28.210
Things that go missing are very
frequently in the upstairs bedroom.

06:28.211 --> 06:29.261
My husband things..

06:29.262 --> 06:30.932
He'll place them on his side of the bed,

06:30.933 --> 06:36.833
and they'll magically be on my
side of the bed in the morning.

06:38.288 --> 06:40.201
There's a..

06:40.202 --> 06:43.263
Person who's stealing things.

06:43.264 --> 06:46.024
He's still here.

06:51.900 --> 06:56.666
My youngest son played hide-and-go-seek
with a couple of little children outside

06:56.667 --> 06:59.789
that we never could find.

06:59.790 --> 07:01.290
And the neighbors informed us

07:01.291 --> 07:06.511
that there are no children
that live in this area.

07:09.639 --> 07:12.886
There's, like, running children.

07:12.887 --> 07:16.787
Running, and children are running.

07:17.364 --> 07:19.042
They were kind of, like, devious.

07:19.043 --> 07:23.913
They would just play pranks and stuff,
like, I think to get attention.

07:23.914 --> 07:29.494
For some reason, it makes
them feel like they're alive.

07:32.848 --> 07:38.748
I wanna ask them why they're
here, but they won't answer me.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.527
I don't know who's taking stuff

07:40.528 --> 07:43.842
because I don't really see
the kids taking anything.

07:43.843 --> 07:49.743
I wanted to blame them, but I don't
know who's taking these things.

07:53.809 --> 07:55.547
So what do you know about the house?

07:55.548 --> 07:58.083
The main legend with this
house is that in the '20s,

07:58.084 --> 08:03.206
there was a Sheriff that lived here,
and he, um, he liked to hang people,

08:03.207 --> 08:05.099
- and..
- Wait, wait. Come again with that?

08:05.100 --> 08:10.920
He was hanging black men outside
the window in the kitchen.

08:29.449 --> 08:32.129
Okay, so there was this man.

08:32.130 --> 08:34.330
He's thin.

08:34.331 --> 08:37.034
This is not the big guy.

08:37.034 --> 08:41.873
He says, "oh, so you're here
to talk to me, are you?"

08:41.874 --> 08:45.685
Maybe he was the owner at some point.

08:45.686 --> 08:48.626
Bad things happened.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.789
- Mm.
- You all right?

08:55.790 --> 08:58.729
This room just kinda..
It's a little much for me.

08:58.730 --> 09:00.028
I can see that.

09:00.029 --> 09:01.337
Your whole demeanor just changed.

09:01.338 --> 09:02.396
Yea.

09:02.397 --> 09:04.404
Take a deep breath, relax. I'm here.

09:04.405 --> 09:06.085
I'll go in.
All right, I'll go into the room.

09:06.086 --> 09:08.006
Okay.

09:11.204 --> 09:13.978
So this is the room you consider evil? Or..

09:13.979 --> 09:17.999
Yes. Yeah, this was my art studio.

09:20.907 --> 09:25.103
I managed to work in here
maybe two weeks, and..

09:25.104 --> 09:28.654
I was working on something, then all
of a sudden, my heart started racing

09:28.655 --> 09:32.161
and my face flushed and I'm
sweating and I couldn't breathe,

09:32.162 --> 09:35.862
and I just.. I had to get out.

09:35.863 --> 09:39.101
There's something right over my shoulder
just saying, "get out of here."

09:39.102 --> 09:40.964
"You're.. You're in my way.
You're in my space."

09:40.965 --> 09:46.185
"This is mine, and you need
to go somewhere else."

09:48.765 --> 09:53.085
There's also a female that's involved.

09:53.957 --> 09:59.190
Her head was messed up, so
maybe she had depression.

09:59.191 --> 10:03.552
She would go outside in the garden and cry.

10:03.553 --> 10:06.613
All the time, crying.

10:10.290 --> 10:13.097
You had mentioned something
about the top of the staircase.

10:13.098 --> 10:15.395
Almost everyone has
encountered just feeling like

10:15.396 --> 10:17.896
there was someone there
with you on the staircase,

10:17.897 --> 10:20.680
and your hair on your arms will stand up.

10:20.681 --> 10:25.961
It's a woman presence, like a..
A.. A sad feeling.

10:26.677 --> 10:31.529
She wanted to get out of the..
Situation that she was in.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.491
I'm hearing..

10:33.492 --> 10:34.628
I'm hearin'..

10:34.629 --> 10:35.446
What are you hearing?

10:35.447 --> 10:37.305
- Mm. Oh, God.
- Well, what are you hearing?

10:37.306 --> 10:39.766
Uh, "murder."

10:54.528 --> 10:57.062
So here's the thing about this place.

10:57.063 --> 11:02.963
There's a lot of energy here,
but it's not being.. Revealed,

11:04.697 --> 11:08.014
and that's really frustrating to me.

11:08.015 --> 11:10.848
Sometimes when an entity
knows I'm in the vicinity,

11:10.849 --> 11:14.041
it'll try to obstruct my senses.

11:14.042 --> 11:16.651
And that's what I'm experiencing right now.

11:16.652 --> 11:22.552
Someone or something does not want me
to know what has really happened here.

11:24.286 --> 11:26.293
There is a lot of interference going on,

11:26.294 --> 11:30.040
and I'm not exactly sure
where it's coming from.

11:30.041 --> 11:32.861
But I feel like..

11:33.382 --> 11:36.742
It's another dead person.

11:42.924 --> 11:46.056
The large figure appears
here pretty regularly.

11:46.057 --> 11:47.952
Does it wake you up?
Or you're awake first and then..

11:47.953 --> 11:50.713
No, it wakes me.

11:55.222 --> 11:57.391
When I'm asleep, he'll be beside the bed.

11:57.392 --> 12:03.292
And if I have any skin exposed,
I'll have an icy cold touch or..

12:03.642 --> 12:08.191
You know, he'll.. He'll pet me, and I..
I don't understand that.

12:08.192 --> 12:09.598
How do you sleep at night?

12:09.599 --> 12:11.819
I don't.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.334
There's, like, someone..

12:18.335 --> 12:21.963
I think it's a male, and
it's a dark figure.

12:21.964 --> 12:25.204
And this is the entity.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.693
He..

12:29.157 --> 12:32.213
Doesn't want anybody to know about him.

12:32.214 --> 12:35.042
- Mm-hmm.
- So he hides.

12:35.043 --> 12:38.165
The accident being seen..

12:38.166 --> 12:39.221
They don't want to be seen?

12:39.222 --> 12:42.417
No. Big, big, big,
big, big mistake.

12:42.418 --> 12:46.978
But it's happened, and
this is not good.

12:56.553 --> 12:58.145
So, Ben, I was talking
to your wife Cynthia,

12:58.146 --> 13:01.710
and she explained some pretty bizarre
things going on in the house.

13:01.711 --> 13:03.392
What about you? You had any issues?

13:03.393 --> 13:06.667
When we first moved in, I fell asleep
on the sofa, watching a movie.

13:06.668 --> 13:08.483
And when I woke up in the
middle of the night,

13:08.484 --> 13:13.971
there was this large, 6-foot-5 guy
that was just standing over me.

13:13.972 --> 13:15.136
Did you think it was an intruder?

13:15.137 --> 13:17.515
At first I did, because, I mean,

13:17.516 --> 13:20.106
all I could see was this..
Like, a shadow figure.

13:20.107 --> 13:20.835
Mm.

13:20.836 --> 13:23.439
And when I seen it, it gave me the chills,

13:23.440 --> 13:27.760
it creeped me out, and I ran upstairs.

13:28.983 --> 13:30.730
She's having some weird
things happen to her.

13:30.731 --> 13:32.638
I mean, she's getting touched.

13:32.639 --> 13:36.177
Yeah, that's what's got me worried the
most, is if she's getting touched.

13:36.178 --> 13:41.778
You know, I don't want the kids
to experience it and stuff.

13:41.779 --> 13:45.028
I had a dream that I actually
sat down at the kitchen table

13:45.029 --> 13:46.933
and had a cup of coffee with the guy.

13:46.934 --> 13:51.587
And in that dream, he had told me that
the house that is sitting here right now

13:51.588 --> 13:53.972
wasn't the house originally.

13:53.973 --> 13:56.539
That's a little odd.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.444
How about the rest of the house here?

13:58.445 --> 13:59.907
Any.. Any strange things?

13:59.908 --> 14:02.067
My worst part's the outside.

14:02.068 --> 14:03.873
Really?

14:03.874 --> 14:07.802
I used to do landscaping and
working a lot of cemeteries.

14:07.803 --> 14:10.023
It almost gives me that same eerie feeling

14:10.024 --> 14:12.182
of walking through a
grave-site or something.

14:12.183 --> 14:14.761
I kinda know what the ground
is supposed to feel like..

14:14.762 --> 14:16.026
- Okay.
- And..

14:16.027 --> 14:18.974
It just feels hallowed.

14:18.975 --> 14:20.021
I don't understand that.

14:20.022 --> 14:25.922
You can actually almost hear, like, an
echo in the ground when you're walking.

14:39.386 --> 14:44.366
They're upset because their
secrets were buried.

14:45.542 --> 14:50.108
There was a lot of stuff
covered up under their land,

14:50.109 --> 14:53.709
buried under the ground here.

14:54.971 --> 14:56.768
And there was a lot of screaming. Um..

14:56.769 --> 14:58.605
So you don't know why? Or..

14:58.606 --> 15:02.326
Well, they're getting murdered.

15:05.743 --> 15:08.090
I'm meeting with Cynthia's
former tenant Julian.

15:08.091 --> 15:13.991
She tells me he got scared and left the
house after just a couple of months.

15:14.858 --> 15:17.176
Julian, can you explain to me what
happened to you when you were here?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.533
There was one night, it was,
like, my first real time

15:19.534 --> 15:22.970
being at the house by myself
for basically the whole day.

15:22.971 --> 15:26.359
All of a sudden, I heard
a really loud thud.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.475
It made me think at first
somebody was in the building.

15:28.476 --> 15:30.677
You know, somebody had went
through the window or something.

15:30.678 --> 15:36.578
So I grabbed my gun and I started looking
around and I never found anything.

15:37.609 --> 15:40.416
So you never found where
exactly the sound came from?

15:40.417 --> 15:41.246
No, I sure didn't.

15:41.247 --> 15:43.192
And when you were searching,
did you actually hear it again

15:43.193 --> 15:45.095
or was it just the one time?

15:45.096 --> 15:48.035
It was just that one time.

15:48.036 --> 15:50.091
I mean, you're frightened about the house?

15:50.092 --> 15:52.799
Yeah. Honestly, yeah.
I felt kind of frightened.

15:52.800 --> 15:53.801
Did you leave after that?

15:53.802 --> 15:55.600
Yeah, I sure did because
it felt like there was

15:55.601 --> 15:57.530
somebody watching me on the back of my head

15:57.531 --> 16:01.851
that didn't want me there, so I left.

16:03.577 --> 16:04.930
Now Cynthia's got three little boys.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.980
You think it's safe for them to stay here?

16:06.981 --> 16:09.203
No, because, you know,
there is something here.

16:09.204 --> 16:11.215
What do you think it is?

16:11.216 --> 16:12.703
It's hard to say what it is.

16:12.704 --> 16:14.220
There's definitely something.

16:14.221 --> 16:16.693
I looked.. I looked around,
everything of my best of knowledge

16:16.694 --> 16:22.594
to try to come up with a logical
explanation, and there wasn't any.

16:27.901 --> 16:30.992
How do the dead interact
with the living, Amy?

16:30.993 --> 16:32.201
Noises.

16:32.202 --> 16:34.628
The noises are definitely the kids.

16:34.629 --> 16:35.706
Know that.

16:35.707 --> 16:37.878
The kids are making the noise

16:37.879 --> 16:41.415
with the floors and the stairs
and the this and the this.

16:41.416 --> 16:44.596
I know it's the kids.

16:45.217 --> 16:47.699
I think they're the ones
who make stuff move.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.592
They know how to do that.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.312
So what.. What sort of things do they do?

16:51.313 --> 16:54.313
Knock something over.

16:57.798 --> 17:00.656
I went to the Courthouse
to do a little research,

17:00.657 --> 17:02.774
and I found that a Chief
of Police did in fact

17:02.775 --> 17:06.538
live in Cynthia's house in the 1920s.

17:06.539 --> 17:12.059
According to his death certificate,
he was fatally shot.

17:14.106 --> 17:18.486
I'm assuming he was killed on the job.

17:18.710 --> 17:23.750
Now I have to find out
who killed him and why.

17:28.771 --> 17:30.738
Chief, I'm doing a background investigation

17:30.739 --> 17:33.518
on a home, and I came across
some records that indicated

17:33.519 --> 17:35.620
he was a Police Chief and
that he was murdered.

17:35.621 --> 17:37.328
I figured the only people that
would really know about that,

17:37.329 --> 17:40.565
being a former Detective myself,
would be the police in town.

17:40.566 --> 17:42.192
Do you know anything about that case?

17:42.193 --> 17:45.011
It's Chief Joe Ben Jenkins.

17:45.012 --> 17:50.912
He was 65 when he was shot and
had been Chief for 12 years.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.281
The land was always tainted.

17:57.282 --> 18:01.842
Things were always messed up in this area.

18:02.887 --> 18:08.787
And that's why people are mean to
each other, you know, do bad things,

18:09.268 --> 18:13.245
because the people that
were murdered here..

18:13.246 --> 18:14.975
It was a bad situation.

18:14.976 --> 18:20.196
Definitely there were people
who died on this land.

18:23.608 --> 18:25.454
Where was he murdered?

18:25.455 --> 18:28.182
He was murdered outside his residence.

18:28.183 --> 18:33.343
- He got shot at his house?
- At his house, yeah.

18:47.225 --> 18:50.225
The land is tainted.

18:50.861 --> 18:54.101
It was a bad situation.

18:54.823 --> 19:00.043
Definitely there were people
who died on this land.

19:02.930 --> 19:05.619
This is a picture of Chief Joe Ben Jenkins.

19:05.620 --> 19:09.144
He was murdered outside his residence.

19:09.145 --> 19:10.780
Do you know anything else about him?

19:10.781 --> 19:15.060
He had six children, some of them,
I believe, were still fairly young

19:15.061 --> 19:16.380
at the time of his death.

19:16.381 --> 19:18.070
Some of the kids would've
been home when this happened.

19:18.071 --> 19:20.852
Yeah, they could've been.

19:20.853 --> 19:22.659
Was he coming home from work?

19:22.660 --> 19:24.116
What.. What were the circumstances?

19:24.117 --> 19:27.262
He went outside to deal
with two black males..

19:27.263 --> 19:31.667
A man named John Willie Clark and his
brother, who were parked outside in, uh,

19:31.668 --> 19:34.165
what ultimately turned
out to be a stolen car.

19:34.166 --> 19:36.289
What's the story with him?
Did he work in the area?

19:36.290 --> 19:40.154
He was an escapee from a
Murray County work camp.

19:40.155 --> 19:45.346
So he was in a stolen car, sitting
outside the Chief's home, drinking.

19:45.347 --> 19:48.285
The Chief went outside,
apparently, to arrest him.

19:48.286 --> 19:51.121
John Willie Clark attempts
to crank his car and leave.

19:51.122 --> 19:54.675
The Chief retrieves his pistol, and
as he's pulling them out of the car,

19:54.676 --> 19:56.785
a struggle ensues over the pistol.

19:56.786 --> 19:58.895
- Okay.
- And during that fight,

19:58.896 --> 20:02.524
a round is fired and hits
Chief Jenkins under the eye,

20:02.525 --> 20:06.965
goes into his brain, kills him instantly.

20:12.684 --> 20:16.913
So he gets killed outside the
house, fighting over his gun..

20:16.914 --> 20:18.715
And then they fled the scene.

20:18.716 --> 20:21.510
Okay, so they.. They leave, and I'm
assuming now there's a manhunt

20:21.511 --> 20:24.189
for John Willie Clark and his brother.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.551
Quite a number of people were out.

20:25.552 --> 20:30.627
In fact, the Mayor and the County
Commissioner had put up a $1,000 reward,

20:30.628 --> 20:34.531
which would've been significant at
the time, during the depression.

20:34.532 --> 20:36.896
Wow. I wasn't expecting this.

20:36.897 --> 20:40.070
It's 1930. It's prohibition.

20:40.071 --> 20:41.878
They're in a stolen car, they're drinking,

20:41.879 --> 20:43.569
and they're in front of the
Chief of Police's house.

20:43.570 --> 20:47.077
Do you know if John Willie
Clark had any interaction

20:47.078 --> 20:49.361
with the Police Chief
prior to going to jail?

20:49.362 --> 20:51.222
Yes.

20:57.620 --> 21:02.959
He's pretty pale-looking, and he's
wearing a very nice suit or something,

21:02.960 --> 21:05.600
and it's dark.

21:05.763 --> 21:09.243
He's.. A little threatened.

21:10.596 --> 21:16.236
I think that he was kind of
like a tyrant kind of guy.

21:16.330 --> 21:18.874
Very controlling.

21:18.875 --> 21:24.515
He was.. He was.. He was controlling.
He was controlling.

21:28.836 --> 21:31.670
I'm about to meet with the
City Attorney David Archer.

21:31.671 --> 21:35.225
He's the town's unofficial historian.

21:35.226 --> 21:37.262
I already know about Chief Jenkins.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.496
Now I need to learn about the
other part of the story..

21:39.497 --> 21:43.277
John Willie Clark, the murderer.

21:44.768 --> 21:47.226
John Willie Clark was
driving a stolen vehicle.

21:47.227 --> 21:50.519
There was a uh, pretty
widespread hunt for him,

21:50.520 --> 21:53.383
but he disappeared for several days.

21:53.384 --> 21:56.413
Now if I read correctly, he
gets shot during the manhunt?

21:56.414 --> 22:00.191
Yeah, someone shot him in the leg,
and he was given medical treatment

22:00.192 --> 22:04.632
before the Sheriff brought him
to the Bartow County Jail.

22:04.633 --> 22:07.896
A group of people went to the jail.

22:07.897 --> 22:13.117
There were 40 to 50 individuals
that had masks on.

22:14.197 --> 22:17.317
They opened the cell..

22:19.627 --> 22:22.989
They told John Willie Clark
to, uh, come with 'em.

22:22.990 --> 22:27.302
They took him downstairs, they
bound him, and the next morning,

22:27.303 --> 22:31.383
John Willie Clark was found hanging.

22:34.133 --> 22:36.645
John Willie Clark, uh, obviously
knew Cartersville a little bit

22:36.646 --> 22:37.974
because he had been
arrested here a few times.

22:37.975 --> 22:40.842
Apparently. You know, the
police force in Cartersville

22:40.843 --> 22:44.341
at that time consisted of
four officers plus the Chief.

22:44.342 --> 22:46.656
- It wasn't a real big force.
- Mm.

22:46.657 --> 22:49.662
It could be that he had been
arrested several other times,

22:49.663 --> 22:53.551
and it could be he had a grudge
against the.. The Police Chief.

22:53.552 --> 22:57.322
But I think John Willie Clark was at
the wrong place at the wrong time.

22:57.323 --> 23:00.169
He was stupid, he was
drunk, he made a mistake,

23:00.170 --> 23:01.937
and he paid the ultimate price for it.

23:01.938 --> 23:05.538
And so did the Police Chief.

23:09.278 --> 23:12.925
So now I'm hearing this screaming.

23:12.926 --> 23:15.765
There's a lot of screaming.

23:15.766 --> 23:18.466
Who's screaming?

23:20.789 --> 23:25.289
Well, this is, like, taking place outside.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.869
I felt like someone had
a brown glass bottle,

23:28.870 --> 23:32.530
and drinking, drinking this stuff.

23:32.531 --> 23:35.938
There's a lot of people
scattering, running, screaming.

23:35.939 --> 23:38.413
I just see, like, the wound and..

23:38.414 --> 23:41.474
Like, all this blood.

24:03.334 --> 24:06.874
There's a lot of screaming.

24:08.427 --> 24:09.731
Who's screaming?

24:09.732 --> 24:14.232
Well, this is, like, taking place outside.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.179
These people are running.

24:20.180 --> 24:24.380
They're scattering, running, screaming.

24:25.607 --> 24:31.507
And then there's this woman coming
forward, and she used to work here.

24:32.807 --> 24:37.702
She took care of everybody.
She ran the house.

24:37.703 --> 24:41.543
Respectable people, decent people.

24:53.318 --> 24:58.276
Something about this story does not
add up, doesn't seem right at all.

24:58.277 --> 25:04.080
You got two black men, one of
which just escaped from jail..

25:04.081 --> 25:09.981
Sitting in a stolen car in 1930s Georgia
during prohibition, and he's drinking.

25:10.478 --> 25:13.150
I'm going to meet with a local historian..
Ed Bostick.

25:13.151 --> 25:18.851
I'm hoping he can shed some
light on this whole mystery.

25:24.249 --> 25:29.720
Well, Ed, thanks for meeting me, but, uh,
I gotta ask you, why in the cemetery?

25:29.721 --> 25:34.401
This is the grave-site of Joe Ben Jenkins..

25:35.727 --> 25:39.458
The Police Chief who was murdered in 1930.

25:39.459 --> 25:41.397
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.

25:41.398 --> 25:46.726
You got two black men, stolen car,
drinking during prohibition.

25:46.727 --> 25:49.119
- One of them just escaped from jail..
- Right.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.765
And he's sitting in front of
the Police Chief's house.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.716
Right. Why?

25:51.717 --> 25:55.064
Is it a bad timing on their part?
Is it a coincidence?

25:55.065 --> 26:00.965
There's local gossip that Will
Clark's wife was in the house,

26:01.126 --> 26:04.099
that she had been employed
by the Jenkins family,

26:04.100 --> 26:10.000
and that the Chief had been making
untoward passes at her, maybe groping her,

26:10.599 --> 26:15.519
and Will Clark was there
to retrieve his wife.

26:17.668 --> 26:19.836
There's a lot of drama.

26:19.837 --> 26:23.917
Like, almost like a forced marriage.

26:25.109 --> 26:27.631
Who is this relationship between
that you're talking about?

26:27.632 --> 26:30.370
It's this man and this woman.

26:30.371 --> 26:34.162
- The thin man?
- The thin man, yeah.

26:34.163 --> 26:36.735
He.. Had issues.

26:36.736 --> 26:42.636
He's, like, O.C.D. and controlling
and kind of, uh, tyrannical.

26:45.308 --> 26:48.043
So we don't know if..
Even if this was true,

26:48.044 --> 26:50.811
if it was consensual
between the Chief and her.

26:50.812 --> 26:54.885
It's a fairly common story among the
black community of Cartersville

26:54.886 --> 26:58.579
that Will Clark was somehow
justified in going there,

26:58.580 --> 27:02.821
that he was defending his wife's honor.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.069
French Detective novels
have a saying about this.

27:05.070 --> 27:06.781
In French, it's "cherchez la femme,"

27:06.782 --> 27:08.722
which means "look for the woman."

27:08.723 --> 27:10.706
You know, now thinking
about what you're saying,

27:10.707 --> 27:12.468
it makes more sense to me that..

27:12.469 --> 27:14.662
Well, he may have broke out of jail

27:14.663 --> 27:16.439
and then was drinking to get enough..
Enough courage

27:16.440 --> 27:18.229
to go in there and confront this guy.

27:18.230 --> 27:23.569
That seems a more likely explanation
to me than coincidence.

27:23.570 --> 27:28.475
How did it look for a white Police
Chief to be coming on to a black woman

27:28.476 --> 27:30.144
that was even working for
him, for that matter?

27:30.145 --> 27:33.685
It would've been scandalous.

27:36.150 --> 27:39.690
She wanted to get of this..

27:40.109 --> 27:42.161
Situation that she was in,

27:42.162 --> 27:46.091
and she didn't like having, you
know, to have sex with him.

27:46.092 --> 27:50.030
He repulsed her. She hated him.
It was disgusting.

27:50.031 --> 27:52.070
I'm trying to figure out who these
people are that you're talking about.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.302
- It's the skinny guy and the lady.
- Okay.

27:55.303 --> 27:57.304
And then she's just showing me in a bed.

27:57.305 --> 27:59.206
She's in a bed and she's dead.

27:59.207 --> 28:02.507
She's dead. She's dead.

28:11.752 --> 28:14.655
I encountered several entities on my walk,

28:14.656 --> 28:20.556
so I decided to have a sketch
artist draw the most prominent two.

28:21.795 --> 28:24.045
First, the big man..

28:24.046 --> 28:28.006
Is his hat way down on his head?

28:28.960 --> 28:30.365
Does he squint? Or are his eyes..

28:30.366 --> 28:35.383
- Yeah, kinda squinty.
- Pretty.. Pretty close? Okay.

28:35.384 --> 28:36.658
He's a stocky dude.

28:36.659 --> 28:40.513
- Okay.
- Like, he's a big, stocky guy.

28:40.514 --> 28:43.250
And the angry thin man.

28:43.251 --> 28:47.931
When you see his eyes, are they fully open?

28:49.456 --> 28:50.691
- This part..
- Mm-hmm.

28:50.692 --> 28:54.232
- Is, like, rounder.
- Okay.

28:55.496 --> 28:57.222
You said you see him in his suit.

28:57.223 --> 29:02.623
Black jacket, white, very
high collar, and a bow-tie.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.413
How old would you say he is?

29:07.414 --> 29:10.294
Probably like.. 45?

29:15.577 --> 29:18.037
Is that him?

29:18.278 --> 29:21.038
Yep, that's him.

29:46.965 --> 29:49.787
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

29:49.788 --> 29:55.323
this is the first time we'll be
hearing each other's findings.

29:55.324 --> 29:57.569
Amy, this is their dream house.

29:57.570 --> 30:00.164
They got it about five,
five and a half months ago.

30:00.165 --> 30:03.178
They actually lease with an option to buy.

30:03.179 --> 30:05.770
Um, but they've had some
issues in the house.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.691
Yeah.

30:07.806 --> 30:12.292
They've got three young boys, and I
think the most important question is,

30:12.293 --> 30:14.596
- are the kids safe?
- Definitely.

30:14.597 --> 30:18.926
And should they spend the
money to buy the place?

30:18.927 --> 30:20.779
It's going to be difficult
for Cynthia and Ben

30:20.780 --> 30:23.543
to hear the truth about their home.

30:23.544 --> 30:25.489
But I've encountered a
lot of activity here,

30:25.490 --> 30:30.479
and it's crucial for them to be
aware of what's going on here.

30:30.480 --> 30:36.060
The first thing that I ran
into were the giggling kids.

30:37.268 --> 30:41.220
There were two children, a boy and a girl.

30:41.221 --> 30:46.873
These children like to make noise
here, especially on the stairwell.

30:46.874 --> 30:49.733
It's like playing for them.

30:49.734 --> 30:53.094
They like to hear sounds.

30:53.690 --> 30:55.206
They were kind of, like, devious.

30:55.207 --> 30:56.549
They would just play pranks and stuff.

30:56.550 --> 31:00.256
Like, I think to get attention.

31:00.257 --> 31:03.857
When I did your interview, one of
the first things she told me about

31:03.858 --> 31:09.407
is hearing young kids playing, and then
chasing literally all around the house

31:09.408 --> 31:13.254
and to the neighbor,
trying to find these kids.

31:13.255 --> 31:16.407
Our son was crying that nobody would
play hide-and-go-seek with him,

31:16.408 --> 31:21.868
and all of a sudden, we hear
these giggling children..

31:22.003 --> 31:24.185
And we can't find them.
That went on for about an hour,

31:24.186 --> 31:29.466
and we just went from yard
to yard, chasing voices.

31:32.869 --> 31:36.789
Well, the thin man that I ran
into has issues with women

31:36.790 --> 31:41.036
and likes to intimidate and control them.

31:41.037 --> 31:45.603
He says, "oh, so you're here
to talk to me, are you?"

31:45.604 --> 31:49.636
Maybe he was the owner at some point.

31:49.637 --> 31:52.577
Bad things happened.

31:52.883 --> 31:55.583
He's tyrannical.

31:57.161 --> 32:00.258
He was a power-hungry little man.

32:00.259 --> 32:06.159
He wouldn't deal with me because
I won't tolerate that behavior.

32:07.060 --> 32:09.391
The women in the home affected..

32:09.392 --> 32:14.192
- Mm-hmm.
- Far more, far more than the men.

32:14.659 --> 32:19.759
In my studio area, I feel
very panicked and sick

32:19.840 --> 32:21.511
and start shaking and flushing.

32:21.512 --> 32:26.884
It's.. It's extreme.
I don't ever even cross the door.

32:26.885 --> 32:29.515
You mentioned about a..

32:29.516 --> 32:32.367
A.. Story of a hanging Sheriff..

32:32.368 --> 32:33.357
Yes.

32:33.358 --> 32:35.224
That lived here, uh,

32:35.225 --> 32:38.063
that used to hang people from the
back porch or something. Alright so..

32:38.064 --> 32:40.627
- What?
- Uh, yeah.

32:40.628 --> 32:43.632
The legend says that the
Sheriff lived here,

32:43.633 --> 32:47.015
and he was.. He was a racist and he..

32:47.016 --> 32:52.916
Hung black men outside the kitchen
window on that side of the house.

32:53.788 --> 32:57.199
All right, so let me try to
clear things up with that.

32:57.200 --> 33:01.473
With every "legend" and rumor,
there's a little bit of truth.

33:01.474 --> 33:03.961
Uh, this guy's name was Joe Ben Jenkins.

33:03.962 --> 33:07.473
Um, he lived in this house
for about 23 years.

33:07.474 --> 33:09.316
Uh, he was the Police Chief here.

33:09.317 --> 33:12.035
- Right.
- Um, in September of 1930,

33:12.036 --> 33:16.119
um, he heard two men in a car..
Two black men in a car..

33:16.120 --> 33:18.195
Outside of the house here.

33:18.196 --> 33:20.082
They were drinking.

33:20.083 --> 33:25.983
He goes out in his, uh, night clothes
with his gun to confront them.

33:26.368 --> 33:31.286
One of the black men in that
car named John Willie Clark

33:31.287 --> 33:35.593
wound up shooting and killing the Chief
right in front of the house here.

33:35.594 --> 33:38.807
The guy, John Willie Clark, he was
apprehended a few days later on.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.746
He was actually..

33:40.747 --> 33:44.548
Busted out of jail by an
angry mob and lynched

33:44.549 --> 33:48.509
not far from, uh, you know, here.

33:55.140 --> 33:58.775
In any investigation, putting a
face to those involved is crucial.

33:58.776 --> 34:02.761
For Amy, that means working
with a sketch artist.

34:02.762 --> 34:06.069
Her sketch has been kept in a
sealed envelope until now,

34:06.070 --> 34:11.190
and the homeowners and I are about
to see it for the first time.

34:11.190 --> 34:14.804
Amy, after the walk, who did you sketch?

34:14.806 --> 34:16.699
The thin man.

34:16.699 --> 34:20.840
I have a photo of the Police Chief.

34:22.393 --> 34:26.697
So why don't you guys take a look at it?

34:26.697 --> 34:29.098
That's him.

34:32.724 --> 34:35.964
That's Joe Ben Jenkins.

34:37.398 --> 34:39.094
Makes a little sense.

34:39.094 --> 34:40.341
Why?

34:40.342 --> 34:42.295
Just the stature.

34:42.295 --> 34:48.196
The figure that I see is always in black
like this, and the hat and everything.

34:48.396 --> 34:53.315
All right, I wanna take
a look at the sketch.

35:01.838 --> 35:04.898
Take a look at this.

35:29.643 --> 35:32.703
Take a look at this.

35:41.471 --> 35:43.331
Wow.

35:43.883 --> 35:46.523
That's amazing.

35:47.671 --> 35:49.332
And eerie.

35:49.333 --> 35:50.958
I'm.. I'm convinced..

35:50.959 --> 35:54.919
- Yep, I'm convinced.
- You know?

35:56.730 --> 36:01.533
The thin man in the sketch
made life miserable for women,

36:01.534 --> 36:06.394
especially the sad lady
I encountered upstairs.

36:07.308 --> 36:13.119
One of the people that I came into
contact with was this sad woman.

36:13.120 --> 36:19.020
And I kind of got that there was a
relationship between him and her.

36:19.971 --> 36:24.291
She felt like she was enslaved by him,

36:24.522 --> 36:27.606
and she didn't like to
be intimate with him.

36:27.607 --> 36:31.259
Um, it was disgusting
and repulsive for her.

36:31.260 --> 36:34.800
She wanted to get of this..

36:35.235 --> 36:37.515
Situation that she was in.

36:37.516 --> 36:40.576
She.. Just hated him.

36:42.296 --> 36:46.287
And she felt like there was no way out.

36:46.288 --> 36:50.257
So that's probably our crying
that we here at night.

36:50.258 --> 36:51.063
Oh. Okay.

36:51.064 --> 36:53.621
We hear the crying woman.

36:53.622 --> 36:55.347
The story goes that the reason

36:55.348 --> 36:57.598
John Willie Clark was out
in front of this house,

36:57.599 --> 37:01.152
was because his wife was having
relations with the Police Chief,

37:01.153 --> 37:04.027
and she did not want to
have relations with him.

37:04.028 --> 37:05.549
It wasn't consensual.

37:05.550 --> 37:08.130
Oh, how awful.

37:10.811 --> 37:14.296
Now some of the rumors about the Sheriff
can't be tied to any hard evidence.

37:14.297 --> 37:20.197
But it's clear that he and John
Willie Clark did not see eye to eye.

37:20.239 --> 37:21.368
Cynthia, you gotta do me a favor.

37:21.369 --> 37:24.977
I need you to tell Amy exactly
what's going on upstairs

37:24.978 --> 37:27.039
when you're getting touched.

37:27.040 --> 37:32.940
I'll just be, you know, laying there,
trying to go to sleep, and..

37:33.045 --> 37:36.147
Anything that's exposed..
It's a very light touch,

37:36.148 --> 37:39.990
but it's almost like
somebody's just admiring me

37:39.991 --> 37:44.863
or just kinda hanging out
and watching me sleep.

37:44.864 --> 37:46.105
Who's doing that?

37:46.106 --> 37:51.109
I think it's the, um, the
entity that can steal things,

37:51.110 --> 37:56.870
um, because he can physically
interact with his environment.

37:57.159 --> 37:58.657
You said he tries to collect things.

37:58.658 --> 37:59.999
Is he trying to collect her?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.502
He may want to.

38:01.503 --> 38:04.736
I.. I don't think he has
enough power to do that.

38:04.737 --> 38:05.754
- Right.
- Um, but..

38:05.755 --> 38:09.775
I think that it needs to stop regardless.

38:09.776 --> 38:14.036
Um, because it's inappropriate, period.

38:18.494 --> 38:21.937
There's another entity
here who is a sweetheart

38:21.938 --> 38:26.438
and thinks that that entity is a monster.

38:26.722 --> 38:29.230
He's big. He's, like, over 6 feet tall.

38:29.231 --> 38:30.319
- Right.
- He's a big,

38:30.320 --> 38:31.367
stocky guy,

38:31.368 --> 38:34.778
but he, like, really took
care of everything here.

38:34.779 --> 38:39.393
Also, the big guy, the caretaker
does not like the kleptomaniac.

38:39.394 --> 38:41.079
They have issues with each other.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.787
They cannot be in the same room together.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.110
- He's a good thing?
- He's a good thing.

38:44.111 --> 38:45.693
- He's helping us.
- Right. He's a very good thing.

38:45.694 --> 38:49.402
- Okay.
- A very good presence.

38:49.403 --> 38:55.007
I've actually had a dream, and a rather
large man sat down at the table with me

38:55.008 --> 38:57.982
and was talking to me and telling
me that everything's okay

38:57.983 --> 38:59.160
and that he's here for us.

38:59.161 --> 39:01.737
Well, it's.. It's some good news.

39:01.738 --> 39:05.663
Amy, you did a second sketch also,
so I'm gonna give you the honors

39:05.664 --> 39:08.345
and tell us who do we think this is.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.306
This is the caretaker that I saw.

39:17.305 --> 39:19.977
Can't forget those eyes.

39:19.978 --> 39:22.306
That's the guy that I had coffee with.

39:22.307 --> 39:24.043
And what do you think
about this whole thing?

39:24.044 --> 39:25.323
Just can't believe it.

39:25.324 --> 39:28.775
Everything that she's heard,
everything that she's seen,

39:28.776 --> 39:31.773
- you know, is coming to light, and..
- And you're not crazy.

39:31.774 --> 39:35.254
Yeah, and we're not crazy.

39:48.071 --> 39:51.768
Guys, you've seen and heard the
results of our investigation.

39:51.769 --> 39:57.050
And the most pressing and important
question is, are you safe to stay here?

39:57.051 --> 39:59.479
Is it.. For you and your children,

39:59.480 --> 40:03.467
and if it's worth investing
and buying the house.

40:03.468 --> 40:08.808
That answer I can't give you.
She's gonna give it.

40:09.632 --> 40:12.089
These are all entities you can deal with.

40:12.090 --> 40:16.434
There are a few people that
need to be dealt with here.

40:16.435 --> 40:18.129
The sad woman..

40:18.130 --> 40:20.852
I would recommend doing a basic cleansing,

40:20.853 --> 40:25.544
which is just going through the
entire house, using Sage and salt.

40:25.545 --> 40:29.772
Because a tiny little fragment of
her personality is still here,

40:29.773 --> 40:35.053
and that's something that
is rather easy to remove.

40:35.519 --> 40:41.419
The children.. With all the cleansing,
they, too, will decide to just leave.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.648
Um, the thin man..

40:43.649 --> 40:49.549
I really believe he will leave as soon
as he understands he has no power here.

40:49.698 --> 40:55.352
Just tell him to bug off, and
eventually he's going to leave.

40:55.353 --> 41:00.606
Who exactly is in that back room causing..
My issues?

41:00.607 --> 41:02.778
It's the entity who steals things.

41:02.779 --> 41:04.872
I can just tell him to go away?

41:04.873 --> 41:07.693
I would ask big Jay to
come in there with you.

41:07.694 --> 41:10.403
Big Jay.. That's actually the caretaker.

41:10.404 --> 41:12.241
Like, you can say, "I'm
going to this room."

41:12.242 --> 41:13.907
"I want you here with me."

41:13.908 --> 41:16.653
You know, he's, like, here for you guys.

41:16.654 --> 41:21.848
That will take a toll on this
entity, and it will leave.

41:21.849 --> 41:24.405
None of my research uncovered a caretaker.

41:24.406 --> 41:30.306
But if he's protecting Cynthia and
Ben, it really doesn't matter.

41:31.696 --> 41:35.979
Now you have a road map on
what to do, thanks to her..

41:35.980 --> 41:37.176
- Definitely.
- And your dream house

41:37.177 --> 41:38.741
doesn't have to be your nightmare house..

41:38.742 --> 41:40.042
- Right.
- Anymore, so..

41:40.043 --> 41:42.084
Exactly. Exactly.

41:42.085 --> 41:45.376
Yeah, this is a tremendous weight..

41:45.377 --> 41:47.001
- Good.
- To know that..

41:47.002 --> 41:48.838
At least I'm not gonna be harmed.

41:48.839 --> 41:52.925
And I can stand up to him, and I
have this nice bouncer behind me..

41:52.926 --> 41:54.378
- Mm-hmm.
- To.. To help me out.

41:54.379 --> 41:56.313
It's really helped a lot, so..

41:56.314 --> 41:59.227
- Yeah.
- I.. It's awesome.

41:59.228 --> 42:01.726
I understand Cynthia and Ben's fears.

42:01.727 --> 42:06.408
When you've had this many
encounters, it's terrifying.

42:06.409 --> 42:10.099
But as long as the stay strong and
follow the advice I've given them,

42:10.100 --> 42:11.959
they should be able to live
happily in their dream home.
