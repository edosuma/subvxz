00:31.372 --> 00:32.679
Well, what do you want me to do?

00:32.806 --> 00:34.077
I can't do everything at once.

00:34.712 --> 00:36.269
I can't.

00:37.605 --> 00:38.768
Solomon Waltzer,

00:38.836 --> 00:41.336
I'm here to see Diane
Lockhart and Adrian Boseman.

00:41.411 --> 00:42.797
Oh, they'll just be a minute.

00:43.289 --> 00:45.034
Look, I only have two hands.
What do you want me to do?

00:45.101 --> 00:46.401
Balloons,
for Lucca Quinn.

00:46.469 --> 00:48.126
Uh, leave them there.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.526
Mr. Waltzer.

01:02.069 --> 01:03.482
Lemond Bishop.

01:03.833 --> 01:05.301
You assisted on one of my cases

01:05.369 --> 01:07.470
- a few years back.
- Yes, Mr. Bishop.

01:08.009 --> 01:09.439
Yeah, how are you?

01:09.790 --> 01:13.874
Uh, things are,
uh, not bad.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.803
They're returning to normal.

01:16.204 --> 01:17.949
I've, uh, taken up golf.

01:18.027 --> 01:19.326
Oh.

01:19.819 --> 01:20.952
I wish I could.

01:21.020 --> 01:22.216
The knees.

01:22.486 --> 01:24.956
That's why God created
golf carts.

01:25.359 --> 01:27.225
Can you hear me? Hello?

01:27.341 --> 01:30.264
Ian. No, I'm off the elevator
now, I just...

01:30.740 --> 01:32.340
Right, and how's he doing?

01:32.465 --> 01:33.840
Yes, thanks for asking.

01:33.908 --> 01:35.165
He's getting married to...

01:35.355 --> 01:36.427
<i>Uh...</i>

01:36.508 --> 01:38.273
Sorry. No, I...
No, I was just saying

01:38.341 --> 01:39.873
that I-I think
what Malcolm needs

01:39.956 --> 01:41.369
is just a little more, uh...

01:41.508 --> 01:44.579
uh... what in the hell?

01:45.366 --> 01:47.070
Uh, no, I'm s-sorry.

01:47.138 --> 01:48.429
S-Something at work.

01:48.497 --> 01:50.095
Let me,
let me call you back.

01:50.269 --> 01:51.810
What is...
what is going on?

01:51.940 --> 01:53.585
Drawing up a prenup.
Are you serious?

01:53.653 --> 01:54.839
With Colin Sweeney?

01:54.907 --> 01:56.235
He murdered two of his wives.

01:56.303 --> 01:58.801
One, and he was found innocent.

01:59.597 --> 02:02.749
What is going on
with this place?

02:03.241 --> 02:04.373
Shut the fuck up.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.827
No, you shut the fuck up.

02:05.895 --> 02:07.098
You're crazy.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.816
Who is more of a threat
to whom?

02:08.883 --> 02:09.705
- Oh...
- Not I.

02:09.774 --> 02:11.045
- Have I ever hit you?
- You hit me

02:11.113 --> 02:12.391
- all the time.
- No, I spank you.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.625
There's a big difference,
and you like it.

02:14.693 --> 02:16.245
- Don't flatter yourself.
- Okay, okay.

02:16.313 --> 02:17.806
Let's just calm this down.

02:17.874 --> 02:19.926
You tell your client
to calm this down.

02:19.994 --> 02:22.215
I'm about ready to say
"fuck your prenup."

02:22.283 --> 02:23.353
Whoa, whoa.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.569
Now, we've settled
all of the big issues here.

02:25.637 --> 02:26.755
Equitable distribution,

02:26.823 --> 02:28.051
- that is huge...
- No, I not agree to that.

02:28.118 --> 02:30.059
You did... you see
what I'm up against?

02:30.127 --> 02:31.959
She's nuts.
She'll be the death of me.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.894
- If you're lucky...
- God, and she's like a drug.

02:35.008 --> 02:36.208
I hired a lawyer.

02:36.276 --> 02:37.352
- You what?
- What?

02:37.420 --> 02:39.188
Yeah, for this
and the other case.

02:39.256 --> 02:40.373
The foreign bullshit.

02:40.441 --> 02:42.935
Foreign corrupt practices.
Naftali...

02:43.007 --> 02:46.216
Hmm? That is a very
complicated case.

02:46.343 --> 02:47.823
You really should
let us

02:47.891 --> 02:49.423
- handle it.
- No, my new lawyer.

02:49.563 --> 02:51.888
He wants to meet us
at his office now.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.707
Solomon is here.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.636
Okay, I've got another one.

03:00.272 --> 03:02.741
Oh, come on.

03:02.821 --> 03:03.937
This is not funny.

03:04.005 --> 03:05.967
Who is doing this? Marissa?

03:06.073 --> 03:08.116
- No, I don't think so.
- Is it the partners?

03:08.184 --> 03:10.575
Because I already said
I don't want a shower.

03:10.655 --> 03:13.221
Look, this one came
with a note.

03:13.307 --> 03:14.953
Give it here.

03:16.523 --> 03:19.331
"Congratulations
on your non-shower."

03:19.408 --> 03:22.017
"Your non-shower"?
Who writes like that?

03:22.413 --> 03:24.709
Could you pass me my cell?

03:31.473 --> 03:34.738
Lucca, they called me in.
Wait, what?

03:34.958 --> 03:36.824
Did you send me balloons?

03:36.935 --> 03:38.552
I don't know,
do you have balloons?

03:38.620 --> 03:41.410
- Colin. I have 84 balloons.
- What?

03:41.478 --> 03:43.484
There are 84 balloons
in my office.

03:43.552 --> 03:44.566
Oh, my God.

03:44.634 --> 03:45.818
Someone's overdoing it.

03:45.886 --> 03:47.875
And make that 96.
Lucca,

03:47.948 --> 03:49.405
I sent you one set
of balloons, that's it.

03:49.472 --> 03:50.872
I don't know
who's sending you the rest.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.749
They're all from you... look,
could you just call

03:53.922 --> 03:57.611
"Balloon Bouquet Express,"
and tell them to stop?

03:57.679 --> 03:58.879
I think there's been a mix-up.

03:58.950 --> 04:00.566
Colin, we're ready for you.

04:00.634 --> 04:02.919
Lucca, I have to call you back,
they're telling me right now

04:02.986 --> 04:04.640
whether I'm the Democratic
nominee.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.885
Right now?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.713
Yep, I'll call you back.

04:08.913 --> 04:11.167
So, here we all are.

04:11.389 --> 04:13.355
Small talk's over with,
and we have

04:13.423 --> 04:15.900
no cases outstanding
against each other,

04:15.968 --> 04:17.666
so what can we do
for you, Sol?

04:17.795 --> 04:21.437
The Chicago PD case,
you did well.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.130
Well, thank you, Sol.

04:23.599 --> 04:24.830
You didn't give up.

04:24.907 --> 04:26.221
We're young and scrappy.

04:26.573 --> 04:28.326
Yes, you are.

04:29.275 --> 04:31.375
I want to consider a merger.

04:34.912 --> 04:36.173
Of our firms?

04:36.303 --> 04:37.494
Yes.

04:37.840 --> 04:41.801
You're the whitest white-shoe
law firm in Chicago.

04:42.204 --> 04:43.561
Why would we want
to merge with you?

04:43.628 --> 04:45.987
For security and legacy.

04:46.177 --> 04:48.533
We have offices in
Washington and London,

04:48.601 --> 04:50.428
you'd have your
pick of clients,

04:50.496 --> 04:52.803
all the prerogatives
of senior partners.

04:52.896 --> 04:54.813
- And why us?
- You beat me.

04:56.450 --> 04:58.301
I'm not used to being beaten.

04:58.604 --> 05:00.161
No.

05:01.289 --> 05:03.398
You just got written up
in the <i> Sun-Times</i>

05:03.466 --> 05:06.040
about your lack
of African-American lawyers,

05:06.267 --> 05:07.447
and clients.

05:07.859 --> 05:09.773
I believe
they said you were...

05:09.957 --> 05:11.697
"hypocritical"?

05:12.357 --> 05:14.685
You're buying diversity, Sol.

05:14.844 --> 05:16.639
- Yes.
- Ah.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.739
And I'm willing to pay for it.

05:19.524 --> 05:20.731
We join you,

05:20.799 --> 05:22.792
how do we not become
the minority lawyers?

05:22.860 --> 05:24.302
Contractual language.

05:24.370 --> 05:25.983
I want that
not to happen.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.262
You think I'm
being hypocritical.

05:28.747 --> 05:30.130
I'm not.

05:30.352 --> 05:32.187
I want what you want.

05:32.528 --> 05:35.494
A firm that reflects
the makeup of America.

05:35.827 --> 05:38.051
And if I have to
pay to do that,

05:38.406 --> 05:39.830
I'm willing.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.364
Okay, okay, okay.

05:41.441 --> 05:43.292
- All right, wait.
- No, no, no, no. What Diane just said

05:43.359 --> 05:44.927
about losing your identity...
Just wait.

05:44.994 --> 05:47.107
Wait! I'm sorry.

05:47.456 --> 05:49.288
One at a time, I'll go first.

05:49.356 --> 05:51.179
"One at a time,
I'll go first."

05:51.247 --> 05:53.133
Seriously? What kind
of leadership is that?

05:53.201 --> 05:55.192
I was in the meeting.
You weren't even there, Julius.

05:55.259 --> 05:56.333
Oh, whose fault was that?

05:56.401 --> 05:58.458
- I was available.
- Can I make a proposal, please?

05:58.872 --> 06:01.347
Solomon runs
the biggest law firm

06:01.415 --> 06:03.507
in the Midwest.
He's offering us all

06:03.593 --> 06:05.215
equity partnerships.

06:05.620 --> 06:06.951
He will guarantee

06:07.019 --> 06:08.453
- we will not be swamped...
- All right,

06:08.520 --> 06:09.558
how does he guarantee that?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.146
We'll have off-ramps after the first
year, and after the second year.

06:12.213 --> 06:14.240
Yeah, but we don't
own our lawyers.

06:14.320 --> 06:15.837
We don't own our clients.

06:15.905 --> 06:17.866
Yeah. So let's talk
about our clients.

06:17.934 --> 06:20.281
What I mean is, even if we
decide to go independent,

06:20.349 --> 06:21.940
even if we make that choice,

06:22.104 --> 06:24.365
our clients
may not follow us.

06:24.433 --> 06:26.809
Yeah, I mean, clients
like Lemond Bishop,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.014
the top drug dealer
in Chicago.

06:29.082 --> 06:31.071
What?
I was coming to work today,

06:31.139 --> 06:33.168
on the phone
with my police captain husband,

06:33.236 --> 06:35.128
and what do I see in reception?

06:35.286 --> 06:36.633
Lemond Bishop?

06:36.795 --> 06:39.460
This is a man who is responsible
for threatening

06:39.528 --> 06:40.768
my family.

06:41.005 --> 06:42.525
Threatening my son

06:42.593 --> 06:44.144
in preschool.
Lemond Bishop has been

06:44.212 --> 06:46.340
- our client for a year now.
- Why didn't I know this?

06:46.441 --> 06:48.835
Well, we don't advertise
it, and we only assist

06:48.903 --> 06:49.922
his personal attorney

06:49.990 --> 06:50.904
- with bigger cases.
- Okay, then,

06:50.972 --> 06:53.286
in the conference room,
I see Colin Sweeney,

06:53.354 --> 06:55.582
who's killed what, uh,
two of his wives?

06:55.659 --> 06:57.765
- One, and he was found not guilty.
- Liz, Liz.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.359
- This is not the subject, Liz.
- No, no, no.

06:59.426 --> 07:02.197
We were just arguing
about losing our identity

07:02.419 --> 07:03.679
to Solomon Waltzer.

07:03.747 --> 07:05.148
What is our identity?

07:05.216 --> 07:06.374
What are we becoming?

07:06.442 --> 07:07.501
- Defense attorneys.
- Bullshit.

07:07.568 --> 07:09.118
Even defense attorneys
draw the line.

07:09.186 --> 07:11.084
Well, why are we drawing
the line at my clients?

07:11.207 --> 07:12.863
Okay. I mean, what
about the double homicide,

07:12.930 --> 07:14.039
what about
the union boss?

07:14.107 --> 07:15.195
Wait, wait, wait,
no, no, no...

07:15.262 --> 07:16.883
not at all homicide...

07:16.951 --> 07:18.544
Ladies, let's not get in...

07:18.816 --> 07:20.367
Okay, hold on. Wait!

07:20.434 --> 07:21.550
Okay?

07:21.630 --> 07:22.973
Okay!

07:23.075 --> 07:26.016
I am really late
for a prenup negotiation.

07:26.564 --> 07:27.830
This is what I'll say.

07:28.273 --> 07:29.767
Let's meet back here at 6:00,

07:29.835 --> 07:31.224
- and we will hash this out.
- Is this your prenup with

07:31.291 --> 07:33.243
- Colin Sweeney?
- The man's a client, Liz.

07:33.311 --> 07:34.395
- Mm.
- Now, we can talk about

07:34.462 --> 07:36.462
getting rid of him later,
if we need to.

07:36.530 --> 07:38.054
I'll be back
in two hours.

07:39.556 --> 07:40.843
Yes?

07:40.979 --> 07:43.527
Yep. I am on my way,
Mr. Sweeney.

07:44.162 --> 07:45.656
Do we have a problem?

07:45.782 --> 07:47.259
I didn't think so.

07:47.327 --> 07:49.613
You're late, and I'm here,
with this demon.

07:49.681 --> 07:50.862
I am not a demon.

07:50.977 --> 07:52.613
And now she's a demon
with a lawyer.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.006
<i>I warned you,
Mr. Sweeney,</i>

07:54.074 --> 07:55.733
it would only be so much time

07:55.801 --> 07:57.447
before she got her
own attorney.

07:57.566 --> 07:58.364
Oh, God.

07:58.441 --> 07:59.984
Now we're back at square one.

08:00.052 --> 08:01.339
No, no, no, no.

08:01.450 --> 08:03.215
<i>We already have lots
of language in place,</i>

08:03.334 --> 08:05.743
Mr. Sweeney.
Yeah, they can rip it up,

08:05.811 --> 08:06.837
but they won't.

08:06.905 --> 08:07.905
<i>They won't? Why?</i>

08:08.107 --> 08:09.270
Adrian, I need
to get on with this.

08:09.337 --> 08:10.850
I downed a little
blue pill recently,

08:11.074 --> 08:12.206
so the clocking is running.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.930
N'est-ce pas?

08:15.945 --> 08:17.691
I've been shot, Mr. Sweeney.

08:17.864 --> 08:19.020
Call 911?

08:19.088 --> 08:19.864
911? Please.

08:19.941 --> 08:21.350
Don't believe that nonsense.
I'm serious.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.739
I've had
the seven-hour erection.

08:23.816 --> 08:25.830
I'm serious.
I am, too.

08:25.914 --> 08:27.837
Signing a prenup for me
has always been

08:27.907 --> 08:29.083
such an aphrodisiac...
I'm serious.

08:29.150 --> 08:30.164
Call 911.

08:30.241 --> 08:31.773
I've been shot.
What?

08:31.850 --> 08:33.663
I've been shot.

08:33.740 --> 08:35.364
Call... I need an ambulance.

08:35.441 --> 08:36.816
What are you talking about?
I've been shot!

08:36.883 --> 08:38.039
Oh! Oh, my...

08:38.116 --> 08:39.964
Just, yeah...
Um...

08:40.168 --> 08:42.510
Hello? Uh, there's-there's
been a shooting.

08:42.578 --> 08:44.401
<i>Reddick, Boseman & Lockhart,
we're on the 23rd floor.</i>

08:44.468 --> 08:45.886
<i>I-I don't know.
Send an ambulance.</i>

08:45.954 --> 08:47.448
<i>There's been an emergency...
Someone's been shot.</i>

08:47.515 --> 08:49.415
- <i>Right away.</i>
- Mr. Boseman.

08:49.505 --> 08:51.062
Is it because I'm a woman?

08:51.441 --> 08:53.340
Marissa.
You're interviewing men

08:53.417 --> 08:54.930
to replace Jay. I'm here.

08:55.007 --> 08:57.047
I thought I was doing a
good job as an investigator.

08:57.117 --> 08:58.763
Marissa.
No, I just want to know

08:58.840 --> 09:01.183
why I'm not being given a chance
to be the sole investigator.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.174
I've been shot.

09:05.508 --> 09:06.964
Call 911!

09:07.041 --> 09:08.973
I did. They're asking
what happened.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.749
A bullet to the chest,
we need paramedics now.

09:10.816 --> 09:13.030
This is life
and death.

09:13.107 --> 09:15.830
Hold this to your chest, Adrian.

09:15.907 --> 09:17.273
Hold it. Where
is the shooter?

09:17.350 --> 09:18.824
On the floor?

09:18.920 --> 09:20.210
The elevator.

09:22.274 --> 09:24.138
Come on, come on.

09:27.216 --> 09:29.141
Oh. Dear God, not more.

09:29.730 --> 09:30.785
Go down the hall

09:30.853 --> 09:32.522
and get Diane and Liz, tell
them Boseman has been shot.

09:32.589 --> 09:33.577
This is my first day.

09:33.645 --> 09:34.995
They're the partners
at the end of the hall.

09:35.062 --> 09:36.815
Tell them Boseman has
been shot, now. Okay.

09:36.883 --> 09:37.968
Security, we've
had a shooting here.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.215
It was someone on the
elevator just a minute ago,

09:40.283 --> 09:41.584
so stop anyone
who's coming down.

09:41.652 --> 09:42.699
Hold them.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.808
No, this is not a drill, do it.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.142
Adrian Boseman has been shot.
The shooter was on the elevator.

09:47.209 --> 09:48.413
Adrian?
Are paramedics coming?

09:48.481 --> 09:49.685
Yes. No, don't... no,

09:49.753 --> 09:51.407
<i>don't shut down the elevators,
we have paramedics coming!</i>

09:51.474 --> 09:52.768
- Let me hold it.
- <i>Tell security</i>

09:52.836 --> 09:53.836
<i>to meet them out front.</i>

09:53.907 --> 09:55.660
- I got shot.
- No, no, no. You're gonna be fine.

09:55.727 --> 09:57.244
You're gonna be just fine.

09:57.427 --> 09:58.972
- I need to do better.
- You're doing great.

09:59.039 --> 10:00.819
Look at me.
Look at me, Adrian.

10:00.887 --> 10:03.258
Look at me, just
look in my eyes...

10:03.448 --> 10:06.334
I'm right here.
I am right here, okay?

11:24.484 --> 11:27.175
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE GOOD FIGHT*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02   Episode 10</font>

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Day 471"</font>

11:53.840 --> 11:55.666
I'm going with him.
Not in the ambulance.

11:55.734 --> 11:57.143
No, I'm his wife.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.385
You'll still have
to follow, ma'am.

11:59.453 --> 12:00.621
Adrian,

12:00.689 --> 12:02.201
I'll meet you at the hospital.

12:26.508 --> 12:28.441
Oh, God.

12:51.341 --> 12:52.500
Where's the victim?

12:52.568 --> 12:54.626
At the hospital.
Or heading for the hospital.

12:54.694 --> 12:55.857
I'm not sure which.

12:55.925 --> 12:57.039
Were you a witness
to the shooting?

12:57.107 --> 12:58.467
Yes. I mean, no.

12:58.565 --> 13:00.333
I was here, but
I-I didn't see...

13:00.452 --> 13:02.944
- There were a lot of calls.
- I want to speak to Liz Lawrence.

13:03.011 --> 13:04.767
Reddick? Oh, she went
to the hospital, too.

13:04.886 --> 13:07.301
Hi. I'm Marissa Gold,
the investigator here.

13:08.243 --> 13:10.157
Adrian Boseman was shot
in the chest.

13:10.225 --> 13:11.857
He was still conscious
when he left

13:11.925 --> 13:13.896
and he said there was
an assailant in the elevator.

13:13.964 --> 13:15.857
- Description?
- He didn't have one.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.922
I called down to have
security stop anyone

13:17.990 --> 13:19.543
- who was leaving the elevators.
- We'll need this floor cleared

13:19.611 --> 13:20.957
and I'll need those
elevators locked.

13:21.025 --> 13:22.991
Arlo, you talk to
security downstairs.

13:23.059 --> 13:24.272
See if there's any
security footage.

13:24.351 --> 13:25.374
Yes, sir.

13:25.442 --> 13:27.929
Because I like
canoes, kay-aks.

13:27.997 --> 13:29.495
Kayaks, you simpleton.

13:29.563 --> 13:32.137
- Okay. "Kayak." So much better.
- Mm-hmm.

13:32.209 --> 13:33.938
Put that in the contract.
"Don't call me simpleton."

13:34.005 --> 13:35.190
I want that
in the contract.

13:35.258 --> 13:36.585
No, what you
want is to kill me.

13:36.653 --> 13:38.644
You want to get me in a kay-ak
and kill me.

13:38.712 --> 13:40.378
- Okay, okay.
- Mr. Boseman, I'm at the law firm

13:40.445 --> 13:42.862
and it's getting
pretty heated here.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.162
Do you want me to just
reschedule for tomorrow?

13:45.239 --> 13:47.171
Where is he? Will you
give me a call, please?

13:47.248 --> 13:49.071
Why am I facing
this nightmare on...

13:49.505 --> 13:51.633
She's thinking
a two-hour surgery.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.071
- How bad?
- I don't know.

13:53.139 --> 13:55.169
A collapsed lung,
but we'll know more soon.

13:56.106 --> 13:57.257
Here we are again.

13:57.325 --> 13:58.402
What do you mean "again"?

13:58.470 --> 13:59.848
The chemical scare
and this.

13:59.916 --> 14:01.922
The chemical scare
wasn't real.

14:02.644 --> 14:04.295
I need your client list.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.331
Look, we're investigating,
but the shooter

14:06.399 --> 14:07.747
was in the elevator.

14:08.214 --> 14:10.439
The crime scene had hundreds
of people moving through it

14:10.507 --> 14:12.146
and more people riding
up and down in it.

14:12.214 --> 14:14.195
- The surveillance cameras?
- None in the elevator

14:14.272 --> 14:16.238
and the lobby cam didn't
pick up anyone unusual,

14:16.306 --> 14:18.482
but again, we don't know
who we're looking for.

14:18.550 --> 14:20.283
- If we knew...
- Attorney-client privilege.

14:20.351 --> 14:22.634
Attorney-client privilege
is not a suicide pact.

14:23.032 --> 14:24.431
Look, whoever shot Adrian

14:24.499 --> 14:27.982
wanted to kill him and Adrian
is alive, so this isn't over.

14:28.688 --> 14:30.254
All right. Let us talk about it.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.271
That's all I ask.

14:37.032 --> 14:38.695
Listen, we can't do that.

14:38.889 --> 14:41.751
We don't know if the shooter
was one of our clients.

14:42.061 --> 14:45.433
Adrian was on TV.
It could be anyone who saw him.

14:45.501 --> 14:47.181
They need some place
to start, Diane.

14:47.249 --> 14:48.271
And without that list,

14:48.348 --> 14:50.076
this is a needle
in a haystack.

14:50.144 --> 14:52.024
We are officially prohibited

14:52.092 --> 14:53.533
from giving our list
to the police.

14:53.601 --> 14:56.091
Right. "Officially."

14:57.702 --> 14:59.228
No.

15:03.339 --> 15:04.995
<i>There he is.</i>

15:05.072 --> 15:06.928
Hey, thanks.
Thank you, thank you.

15:06.996 --> 15:08.905
Colin, you're our
man.

15:08.973 --> 15:11.289
I'm flattered, Frank.
All right.

15:11.357 --> 15:12.907
Well, just don't
take it for granted.

15:12.975 --> 15:15.309
Even though Democrats have
always won in the first.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.826
These are strange times.

15:16.948 --> 15:18.471
Well, I'm gonna go out there
and kick some butt.

15:18.538 --> 15:20.160
Great. That's why we chose you.

15:20.228 --> 15:21.714
All right. Thanks.

15:21.842 --> 15:22.842
Thank you.

15:22.924 --> 15:24.946
Um, your girlfriend,
Lucca...

15:25.034 --> 15:27.078
Yeah? ...she works
at Reddick/Boseman.

15:27.186 --> 15:28.276
The law firm, right?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.884
Yes. Why? Well, I don't
mean to unnerve you,

15:30.952 --> 15:33.568
but I just got a text
there's been a shooting there.

15:34.036 --> 15:35.370
I'm sorry, what?

15:35.438 --> 15:37.294
A shooting. A friend
on another floor

15:37.362 --> 15:40.027
says, "Paramedics are
taking someone away."

15:40.828 --> 15:42.068
Uh, wh-who?

15:42.140 --> 15:44.093
He didn't say.
You should call her.

15:44.181 --> 15:48.932
Uh, yeah. I, uh, yeah,
I, uh, excuse me.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.133
I-I'm sure everything's
all right.

15:54.168 --> 15:56.317
- <i>Your call has been forwarded.</i>..
- Come on.  -  Hey, I'm all right.

15:56.384 --> 15:58.007
<i>to an automated
voice-messaging system.</i>

15:58.148 --> 16:00.018
<i>Lucca Quinn is not available.</i>

16:00.086 --> 16:02.028

- <i>If you act now,</i>

17:21.583 --> 17:23.873
<i>Has the rat race got you down?</i>

17:24.118 --> 17:26.102
What the fuck? Come on!

17:41.942 --> 17:43.336
Lucca.

17:43.463 --> 17:45.853
I'm awake. I'm awake.

17:47.002 --> 17:48.826
- More balloons?
- You're okay.

17:48.914 --> 17:51.949
Yeah. I'm just trying
to take a nap.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.207
Why?

17:53.275 --> 17:55.355
- You don't know what's going on?
- What do you mean?

17:59.696 --> 18:01.299
Hey. Mrs. Reddick.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.468
Uh, I need
our latest client list.

18:03.555 --> 18:05.543
Sure. You want me to
call Julius for it?

18:05.610 --> 18:06.825
No.
<i>No.</i>

18:06.893 --> 18:08.213
<i>Do you have access to it
yourself?</i>

18:08.282 --> 18:10.195
I should on my computer.

18:10.761 --> 18:12.038
Would you e-mail it to me?

18:12.115 --> 18:13.518
Yeah. Right away.

18:22.027 --> 18:23.353
What?

18:58.348 --> 18:59.695
This is unofficial.

18:59.824 --> 19:01.338
Yes.
Husband and wife.

19:01.557 --> 19:02.897
Yes.

19:30.541 --> 19:32.335
The world's gone crazy.

19:33.195 --> 19:34.510
Mm.

19:35.244 --> 19:37.402
I can't remember
when it was sane.

19:37.561 --> 19:39.967
My daughter says the same thing.

19:42.774 --> 19:46.291
She's a journalist.
<i>USA Today.</i>

19:46.738 --> 19:50.904
She can't remember a time when
reporters weren't screamed at

19:51.315 --> 19:53.332
or spat upon or targeted.

19:53.570 --> 19:55.277
And that's after two years.

19:55.636 --> 19:57.842
What will it look like
two years from now?

20:00.778 --> 20:02.745
Well, you're a font of optimism.

20:05.049 --> 20:07.194
One has to remember normal

20:07.541 --> 20:12.184
or every new outrage will be
absorbed and accepted.

20:12.529 --> 20:14.074
I studied medicine.

20:14.372 --> 20:16.665
It's Wilder's law
of initial value.

20:16.733 --> 20:20.985
You have to know how a body acts
unaffected by stimuli

20:21.330 --> 20:23.512
so you can judge the stimuli.

20:23.939 --> 20:27.383
What good is judgment if you
can't do anything about it?

20:27.905 --> 20:30.790
What's the good of eyesight
if you have nothing to look at?

20:39.063 --> 20:40.413
I think we're gonna need
some time

20:40.481 --> 20:42.053
to discuss
your proposal, Sol.

20:42.121 --> 20:43.567
Don't worry about that.

20:43.821 --> 20:45.172
That's not why I'm here.

20:45.579 --> 20:46.721
I like Adrian.

20:46.789 --> 20:48.683
I just want to make
sure he's well.

20:50.639 --> 20:52.314
Oh, excuse me.

20:57.076 --> 20:58.121
Hello?

20:58.189 --> 21:02.174
Diane, I'm here
with five unexpected visitors.

21:02.242 --> 21:03.254
Mr. Lester?

21:03.322 --> 21:05.788
Yes, and I'm speaking to you
from Lemond Bishop's house

21:05.856 --> 21:09.547
where five representatives
of the Chicago Police Department

21:09.615 --> 21:11.072
have forced their way in

21:11.140 --> 21:13.039
and are insisting
on questioning him.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.321
About what?

21:14.389 --> 21:16.492
About a shooting at your office.

21:16.560 --> 21:17.793
They're insisting

21:17.867 --> 21:21.567
Mr. Bishop qualifies
as a "person of interest."

21:21.747 --> 21:23.403
Put them on the line.

21:23.679 --> 21:25.326
Mr. Bishop's lawyer...

21:25.604 --> 21:30.651
They're, uh,
declining the invitation.

21:30.801 --> 21:33.047
Look, I was under
the distinct impression

21:33.115 --> 21:35.263
that who is and
who is not a client

21:35.331 --> 21:37.296
is considered
privileged information.

21:37.364 --> 21:38.832
Am I mistaken in that belief?

21:38.900 --> 21:41.059
No, and I don't know how
they found out he was a client,

21:41.126 --> 21:42.986
but I'm on my way.

21:43.406 --> 21:46.077
Please tell Lemond not to say
anything until I get there.

21:46.145 --> 21:48.398
Believe it or not, I knew that.

21:53.128 --> 21:55.684
No, but I need you to help me
with Lemond Bishop.

21:55.793 --> 21:57.026
The police are questioning him.

21:57.093 --> 21:59.940
Wait. Diane.
I'm trying to catch up.

22:00.153 --> 22:01.856
Where is Adrian?
He's still in surgery,

22:01.924 --> 22:03.969
but the police are already
questioning Bishop

22:04.044 --> 22:05.536
- about his shooting.
- Oh, my God.

22:05.604 --> 22:07.530
- Did-Did Bishop...?
- No.

22:07.598 --> 22:09.762
I mean, I don't know,
but that wouldn't make sense.

22:09.969 --> 22:11.621
Listen, we're shorthanded

22:11.689 --> 22:13.935
and we need to put up
a good show for Bishop.

22:14.003 --> 22:15.317
Yeah. I got it.

22:15.481 --> 22:17.373
- I'm on my way.
- What do you mean?

22:17.441 --> 22:18.621
You're on your...
Where are you going?

22:18.688 --> 22:20.114
Um, a client's house.
I'm okay.

22:20.182 --> 22:22.215
You're going to Lemond Bishop's.
I heard.

22:22.282 --> 22:23.430
Colin, I'm okay.

22:23.498 --> 22:25.819
It's sweet you rushed here,
but I'm okay.

22:25.887 --> 22:27.677
Lucca, he's the top killer
in Chicago.

22:27.745 --> 22:30.046
No, he's not. He's out
of prison. He's going straight.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.755
Oh, my God. Are you crazy?
How can you be so naive

22:32.823 --> 22:35.353
about your own clients and
so cynical about everything else?

22:35.421 --> 22:36.892
I have to go.

22:37.402 --> 22:39.007
No, no, no. Lucca.

22:39.186 --> 22:42.600
The person that shot, that shot
your boss is still out there.

22:42.668 --> 22:43.626
It could be Bishop.

22:43.694 --> 22:44.902
That's not Bishop.

22:44.970 --> 22:47.050
That's not what he does.

22:47.594 --> 22:49.827
Yeah, he just hires other
people to kill for him.

22:50.033 --> 22:52.155
Colin, I have
to do my job,

22:52.339 --> 22:54.102
the same way
you have to do yours.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.294
Okay, all right.

22:55.397 --> 22:56.930
Then I'm coming with you.

22:57.519 --> 22:59.536
No. You're not.

22:59.954 --> 23:01.182
I'm not your property.

23:01.297 --> 23:03.211
You're not my husband.

23:03.772 --> 23:06.012
Then what am I
to you, Lucca, huh?

23:06.215 --> 23:07.438
I don't know.

23:08.103 --> 23:09.894
I really don't.

23:10.508 --> 23:13.281
I need you to push all
of Adrian's cases and meetings

23:13.349 --> 23:14.370
just until Friday.

23:14.438 --> 23:15.999
Are the doctors
being that optimistic?

23:16.067 --> 23:18.644
No, but we will deal with it
on Friday.

23:18.712 --> 23:20.401
We have to appear optimistic.

23:20.469 --> 23:21.789
Listen, that's my call-waiting.

23:21.857 --> 23:23.323
Okay. Keep me in touch.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.842
- Hello?
- Oh, my God, Diane.

23:24.910 --> 23:26.548
I can't get ahold of anyone.
Is it true?

23:26.616 --> 23:28.113
Yes, but I'll have
to call you back.

23:28.181 --> 23:29.822
No, no.
I'm at the Sweeney prenup.

23:29.890 --> 23:30.800
They want to continue.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.771
All right. Just tell them
we will be in touch on Friday.

23:33.839 --> 23:36.465
Hey. It's Sweeney time.

23:36.533 --> 23:38.062
Diane, Sweeney wants
to do it alone.

23:38.130 --> 23:39.935
Maia, I need you
to take care of this.

23:40.003 --> 23:41.589
I will call you in an hour.

23:41.657 --> 23:44.210
Adrian Boseman is
in the hospital.

23:44.352 --> 23:45.602
- There was a shooting.
- Okay,

23:45.670 --> 23:47.444
this is a trick.
This is a lawyer trick.

23:47.512 --> 23:48.769
I don't even know
why that matters.

23:48.836 --> 23:50.684
You can sign this prenup
right now, Mr. Sweeney.

23:50.751 --> 23:53.578
Yes, unless you want
to be a little girl.

23:53.728 --> 23:55.842
Oh, my God,
when she says that...

23:55.910 --> 23:57.257
No, sir.
We are not signing this.

23:57.325 --> 23:59.440
Why? You're not a lawyer.
You're the coffee girl.

23:59.508 --> 24:01.204
I am Mr. Sweeney's lawyer,

24:01.272 --> 24:02.738
and we object
to the kayak exception.

24:02.806 --> 24:04.224
Why? It's a small matter.

24:04.292 --> 24:06.590
All of Mr. Sweeney's fortune
goes to Ms. Amado

24:06.658 --> 24:08.922
if Sweeney is killed
in a kayak accident?

24:08.990 --> 24:10.700
- Are you serious?
- What? I'm not going to kill him.

24:10.767 --> 24:12.748
How many times
do I have to say it?

24:19.008 --> 24:20.781
I'm not sure why I'm
being treated this way.

24:20.849 --> 24:22.664
This will be
dealt with quickly.

24:23.777 --> 24:25.410
Ms. Lockhart.

24:26.454 --> 24:28.035
Captain.

24:29.853 --> 24:31.531
Mr. Bishop, your name is listed

24:31.599 --> 24:33.588
as an officer
in Downstate Movers,

24:33.785 --> 24:35.369
- a company associated...
- No. No.

24:35.437 --> 24:37.577
You gained entry
into Mr. Bishop's house

24:37.649 --> 24:39.856
on the basis of an
ongoing investigation.

24:39.985 --> 24:41.617
Is that what they
told you, Mr. Lester?

24:41.750 --> 24:42.839
Correct.
All right.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.490
I will permit you to ask
Mr. Bishop questions

24:45.558 --> 24:48.604
only if they directly relate
to that investigation.

24:48.672 --> 24:50.917
Where were you at 11:00 a.m.
today, Mr. Bishop?

24:51.040 --> 24:52.832
At Reddick, Boseman, & Lockhart.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.213
The law firm where
Adrian Boseman was shot?

24:55.281 --> 24:58.171
Yes. I had a meeting with
Mr. Boseman, then I left.

24:58.239 --> 25:00.585
So you were at the firm
40 minutes before the shooting?

25:00.653 --> 25:02.201
I don't understand
the theory here.

25:02.269 --> 25:05.360
Do you think he went there
in order to case the joint?

25:05.428 --> 25:06.592
What was the meeting about?

25:06.660 --> 25:08.544
No. We're asking
Mr. Bishop not to answer that question

25:08.612 --> 25:09.890
due to attorney-client
privilege.

25:09.958 --> 25:11.217
Are there any firearms
in the house?

25:11.284 --> 25:13.184
We're asking Mr. Bishop
not to answer that question.

25:13.251 --> 25:14.941
It's irrelevant
to your investigation.

25:15.009 --> 25:16.899
You think firearms
in the house is irrelevant?

25:16.973 --> 25:19.152
I think the relevant question
you're looking for

25:19.220 --> 25:22.752
is did Mr. Bishop use firearms
to shoot Adrian Boseman.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.324
What about narcotics?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.306
We're asking Mr. Bishop
not to answer that question.

25:26.373 --> 25:28.700
Ms. Lockhart, we are trying to
find out who shot your partner.

25:28.767 --> 25:30.991
No, you are using this
investigation in order

25:31.059 --> 25:32.929
to intimidate Mr. Bishop
because he's the one

25:32.997 --> 25:34.210
that got away.

25:34.278 --> 25:36.510
You have legitimate
questions, ask them.

25:36.692 --> 25:38.783
If not, stop
wasting our time.

25:45.672 --> 25:48.238
<i>All right,
everyone out.</i>

26:04.321 --> 26:05.964
Fix this, Diane.

26:06.757 --> 26:09.904
I came back to you because
we did good work together,

26:10.641 --> 26:12.131
but this is not okay.

26:12.337 --> 26:14.783
How did they even know
I was a client?

26:15.420 --> 26:18.404
I don't know,
but we will fix this.

26:20.714 --> 26:23.427
I had nothing to do
with Boseman.

26:23.568 --> 26:25.667
And this puts a bull's-eye
on my back.

26:25.735 --> 26:28.137
We will take it off.

26:32.039 --> 26:33.637
How many months?

26:33.969 --> 26:36.234
Uh, eight, sir.

26:37.767 --> 26:40.314
They grow up so fast.

26:43.072 --> 26:44.942
Cherish every moment.

26:49.531 --> 26:51.904
So this Captain Lawrence
is married

26:51.972 --> 26:53.838
to one of your partners,
isn't he?

26:53.915 --> 26:56.390
Liz Reddick has nothing to do
with your account. I do.

26:56.458 --> 26:59.123
Yes, Chinese walls.

26:59.191 --> 27:00.543
I know.

27:00.611 --> 27:03.549
In my experience,
Chinese walls are porous.

27:03.731 --> 27:05.622
Uh, excuse me.

27:08.072 --> 27:11.088
Uh, Maia, sorry, uh,
this is not a good time.

27:11.156 --> 27:12.722
Sweeney just got a call
from the police.

27:12.790 --> 27:14.235
They want to question him.

27:14.830 --> 27:18.362
Shit. Where is Sweeney
supposed to go?

27:18.430 --> 27:20.212
First district,
in an hour.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.308
No, tell Captain Lawrence
we'll do it in our offices.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.399
How did you know
it was Captain Lawrence?

27:25.526 --> 27:26.716
Wild guess.

27:27.234 --> 27:30.244
I mean, the police are just
pursuing their own agenda.

27:30.545 --> 27:31.968
I should
call Dipersia.

27:32.372 --> 27:35.582
If he knew what was going on,
he would come back.

27:37.270 --> 27:39.166
Right, he would.

27:40.166 --> 27:41.874
Why'd you leave
your last firm?

27:42.017 --> 27:44.683
I'd been there too long.
You know, you get stale.

27:45.172 --> 27:46.856
Well, we're looking
for diversity,

27:46.924 --> 27:49.185
and we need someone
who'll start immediately.

27:50.454 --> 27:51.719
You need to get that?

27:52.006 --> 27:54.157
Do you mind? It's a friend
who's about to give birth.

27:54.225 --> 27:56.170
Oh, my God, no.
No, answer, answer.

27:58.967 --> 28:00.299
Lucca, are you
all right?

28:00.367 --> 28:02.890
It's not me.
It's Boseman. He's been shot.

28:03.175 --> 28:05.283
What?
He's in surgery at Harbour.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.790
They think he'll
be all right, but...

28:06.857 --> 28:08.331
Oh, my God. What happened?

28:08.527 --> 28:11.358
Someone came to the firm.
We don't know who.

28:11.530 --> 28:13.300
And the police aren't helping.

28:13.397 --> 28:14.478
I'm on my way.

28:14.546 --> 28:15.992
Wait. Don't you want
to know more?

28:16.060 --> 28:17.208
I'm on my way.

28:17.693 --> 28:20.074
Thank you for the offer,
but I have to go.

28:30.558 --> 28:32.690
Liz? Liz,

28:32.899 --> 28:34.341
can you hear me now?

28:34.409 --> 28:36.258
Liz, I just got off
the freight elevator.

28:36.326 --> 28:37.632
What's his status?

28:37.700 --> 28:38.883
How is he?

28:38.951 --> 28:40.358
He's out of surgery.

28:40.434 --> 28:42.701
Uh, but they think it's
gonna be a long recovery.

28:42.796 --> 28:44.901
It's hard to hear you.
Wh-Where are you?

28:44.969 --> 28:48.254
The 22nd floor. The police
have cordoned off the 23rd.

28:48.322 --> 28:50.668
Listen, I just came
from your husband

28:50.736 --> 28:52.291
questioning Lemond Bishop,

28:52.359 --> 28:53.688
and in about 20 minutes

28:53.756 --> 28:55.622
I will be supervising
his questioning

28:55.690 --> 28:56.980
of Colin Sweeney.

28:57.048 --> 28:58.904
Well, that makes sense.

28:58.994 --> 29:01.610
They are our most
violence-prone clients.

29:01.678 --> 29:05.582
Liz, neither had a single
solitary reason to shoot Adrian.

29:05.650 --> 29:07.633
- We don't know that.
- Yes, we do.

29:08.312 --> 29:11.367
Did you give your husband
our client list?

29:11.490 --> 29:15.521
Diane, our partner was shot.
He has a bullet in his chest.

29:15.589 --> 29:17.492
And I'm gonna move heaven
and earth to keep him safe.

29:17.559 --> 29:20.154
I understand that, but your
husband is not working for us.

29:20.222 --> 29:22.203
I don't tell my husband
how to do his job.

29:22.271 --> 29:24.436
Yeah, well, be good
if he returned the favor.

29:26.893 --> 29:28.663
Hey, you're back.
Yeah, have you seen him?

29:28.818 --> 29:30.632
Yeah, he's in here.

29:31.411 --> 29:33.211
He's our investigator.

29:36.866 --> 29:38.631
How long ago
was he out of surgery?

29:38.788 --> 29:40.230
Two hours.

29:40.323 --> 29:41.867
Did the police question him?

29:41.945 --> 29:44.194
Yeah, but they didn't
get anything.

29:45.564 --> 29:47.120
We need to make a list
of all our clients

29:47.187 --> 29:48.430
for the last two years.

29:48.583 --> 29:50.615
A list of the all people
we beat in civil suits.

29:50.882 --> 29:52.537
I already pulled
their files.

30:00.056 --> 30:03.390
Adrian. Can you hear me?

30:04.666 --> 30:07.617
Adrian, it's Jay.
Can you hear me?

30:12.231 --> 30:14.664
If you can hear me, nod.

30:17.228 --> 30:21.033
Good, good.
Did you see the shooter?

30:22.251 --> 30:23.920
Did you recognize him?

30:23.994 --> 30:26.060
You didn't recognize him?

30:26.233 --> 30:29.520
Was he black?
Good.

30:29.630 --> 30:32.830
He was white? Okay, okay.

30:46.548 --> 30:47.904
What did he say?

30:48.227 --> 30:49.525
That he didn't see
the shooter clearly,

30:49.592 --> 30:51.383
but what he did see
was that he was Caucasian

30:51.451 --> 30:54.322
and his face was mostly covered
with a scarf, a red scarf.

30:54.390 --> 30:55.537
That's all he saw.

30:55.854 --> 30:57.493
Okay, we should check
the lobby security camera.

30:57.560 --> 30:59.487
Yup. On our way.

31:05.167 --> 31:06.592
Anything?

31:07.218 --> 31:09.712
Yeah, the problem is the
security cameras in the lobby

31:09.780 --> 31:12.636
use varifocal lenses...
When they zoom in and out,

31:12.704 --> 31:13.863
they lose pixels.

31:13.931 --> 31:16.450
A lot of Chicago police monitors
are set on autofocus,

31:16.518 --> 31:18.176
so when a varifocal
camera is hooked up

31:18.244 --> 31:19.509
to an autofocus monitor,

31:19.577 --> 31:22.512
it degrades the image.
I just fell asleep.

31:23.259 --> 31:24.873
Which is why we can see things

31:24.941 --> 31:26.421
the cops can't.

31:26.997 --> 31:29.563
Wait, is that a red scarf?

31:30.376 --> 31:31.533
Looks like it.

31:31.601 --> 31:34.566
He must've gotten off on a low
floor and took the stairs down.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.352
What's under the cap?

31:38.064 --> 31:40.121
Looks like a do-rag.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.255
How many white guys
wear do-rags?

31:42.469 --> 31:43.917
Let's take a look
at the clients.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.942
Which law firm?
My life has been law firms

31:47.010 --> 31:49.700
- for the last two weeks.
- This law firm. Upstairs.

31:49.768 --> 31:51.557
Oh. I had a meeting
around 11:30.

31:51.625 --> 31:52.691
Just before
the shooting.

31:52.759 --> 31:54.973
Maybe we should, uh,
meet alone without Naftali.

31:55.041 --> 31:56.822
No, I want to know
what I'm marrying.

31:56.890 --> 31:58.297
Did you
and Adrian Boseman argue?

31:58.365 --> 31:59.933
No.
Don't lie, Sweeney.

32:00.001 --> 32:02.697
The police will find out. You
argued with Boseman. I didn't.

32:02.765 --> 32:03.898
Yeah, because
he's your lawyer.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.646
- I'm calling a halt to this.
- I'm not done.

32:05.713 --> 32:08.258
Uh, Maia, why don't you take
them into Lucca's office

32:08.326 --> 32:09.849
to discuss the prenup?

32:09.917 --> 32:12.164
What's happened to this place?

32:12.830 --> 32:14.820
It's like a cattle auction.

32:14.948 --> 32:16.755
The police moved us
down a floor.

32:16.832 --> 32:18.127
Yeah, look, balloons.

32:18.241 --> 32:21.050
Wow, very professional
place you have, Sweeney.

32:21.118 --> 32:22.743
It makes me feel
really confident.

32:22.819 --> 32:24.875
One of the reasons
I liked this firm

32:24.943 --> 32:27.012
was you were able
to handle the police.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.081
I'm afraid you've
lost that skill.

32:29.149 --> 32:30.287
What is this?

32:30.355 --> 32:32.543
The location where
I want my files sent.

32:32.611 --> 32:34.401
I don't understand.
That's my notice.

32:34.534 --> 32:36.170
I'm taking my business
to another firm.

32:36.238 --> 32:39.081
Let me get Diane.
No, she intimidates me.

32:39.149 --> 32:41.172
You are intimidated by a duck.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.639
Thank you for all
your help, Millie.

32:43.728 --> 32:44.885
Maia.
Maia.

32:44.953 --> 32:46.396
Good-bye.

32:47.788 --> 32:50.877
Where are you going?
Mr. Sweeney, which firm?

32:50.945 --> 32:52.712
I've been asked
not to say.

32:57.765 --> 32:59.170
O-Okay.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.723
Uh, give us
the afternoon.

33:01.824 --> 33:03.437
Which firm is it?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.397
No! I don't think

33:06.465 --> 33:09.038
you should be sending
your files to Mr. Lester.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.422
Listen, can we just...

33:13.377 --> 33:16.911
Uh, yes. Let's-let's just speak
about it later. Thank you.

33:17.087 --> 33:18.136
Where is he going?

33:18.204 --> 33:20.803
He won't say, but he wants
the files sent here.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.363
No. That's his home address.

33:23.510 --> 33:26.526
And-and-and Bishop is replacing
us, too, and he won't say where.

33:26.594 --> 33:28.018
- Bishop?
- Yes.

33:30.754 --> 33:31.920
What are you
doing in here?

33:31.988 --> 33:33.835
It's the only quiet place.

33:35.249 --> 33:37.386
Listen, someone is coming
after our clients.

33:37.499 --> 33:39.245
I know.
I was just going to tell you.

33:39.316 --> 33:41.325
Brandon Hayakawa is leaving us.

33:41.393 --> 33:43.225
- Did he say for where?
- No.

33:43.293 --> 33:44.296
He's gonna send the address

33:44.364 --> 33:46.387
for the transfer of files
within a week.

33:46.544 --> 33:48.944
Someone's taking advantage of
Boseman being out. All right.

33:49.012 --> 33:50.615
We've got to get on the phone
with all of the clients.

33:50.682 --> 33:51.962
Get all of the partners
together.

33:52.072 --> 33:53.483
We should've made
these calls earlier.

33:53.550 --> 33:54.840
Who do you think it is?

33:56.521 --> 33:58.328
Diane? How's Adrian?

34:00.568 --> 34:01.943
Thank God.

34:02.403 --> 34:03.913
Well, he's a fighter.

34:06.214 --> 34:07.743
Okay, what?

34:10.069 --> 34:11.492
No. Who said that?

34:11.560 --> 34:13.248
I'm with Charles Lester
right now,

34:13.317 --> 34:15.481
and I asked him straight out
where the files are going

34:15.549 --> 34:17.235
and he mentioned you.

34:19.569 --> 34:21.440
Well, he's not
telling the truth.

34:21.696 --> 34:23.172
Adrian's in the hospital.

34:23.241 --> 34:25.206
I would never
take advantage of that.

34:25.831 --> 34:27.065
Then why would he lie?

34:27.132 --> 34:29.193
I have no idea.
Diane, you and I are

34:29.261 --> 34:31.308
on the same side in this fight.

34:31.576 --> 34:33.563
Charles Lester's
on the other line.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.955
Diane, hold on one second.

34:36.123 --> 34:37.385
Charles, what's wrong?

34:37.453 --> 34:39.226
Actually,
it's Charles's assistant.

34:39.295 --> 34:41.754
Uh, I have Diane Lockhart here.

34:41.884 --> 34:43.716
She says you approved the files

34:43.784 --> 34:46.592
being sent to your offices.
Is that true?

34:47.099 --> 34:49.277
No, she's bluffing you.

34:49.369 --> 34:51.225
Hold the files for a week.

34:52.827 --> 34:54.791
Thank you. I'll relay.

34:55.293 --> 34:56.762
Diane, I'm sorry.

34:56.886 --> 34:58.337
I don't know why
Charles is saying this,

34:58.404 --> 35:00.599
but I can try to find out
where he's going.

35:00.749 --> 35:02.593
You know, you know, which firm.

35:02.989 --> 35:04.580
Yeah, thank you.

35:04.648 --> 35:06.435
- No problem.
- Oh, and Solomon,

35:06.503 --> 35:09.864
can we meet later on in the day
to discuss the merger?

35:09.932 --> 35:11.486
You really want to?

35:11.645 --> 35:13.577
Don't you want to wait
until Adrian's well?

35:13.717 --> 35:15.141
No, I think it's a good idea

35:15.209 --> 35:17.952
to get the outline
of the merger down.

35:18.164 --> 35:19.914
All right, how about 5:00?

35:20.483 --> 35:22.306
5:00 would be perfect.

35:23.308 --> 35:24.932
Thank you.

35:28.043 --> 35:29.948
What did you say?

35:30.944 --> 35:32.888
That we should meet.

36:08.793 --> 36:10.251
Straighten your tie.

36:10.799 --> 36:12.356
Don't sit on the floor.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.145
Go to the law firm
on the eighth floor

36:14.212 --> 36:16.257
and ask for the use
of their chairs.

36:21.843 --> 36:24.272
I think it's time
to get rid of the balloons.

36:25.075 --> 36:27.075
I agree.

36:48.450 --> 36:49.823
So these are all
our white clients?

36:49.891 --> 36:50.910
Right.

36:50.978 --> 36:52.189
"Frank Gwinn."

36:52.257 --> 36:53.642
He was the shoe salesman, right?

36:53.780 --> 36:54.960
Yes.

36:55.699 --> 36:57.169
<i>We lost this case?</i>

36:57.237 --> 36:58.710
<i>Yes, but Maia and Lucca</i>

36:58.778 --> 37:00.140
- were his lawyers.
- Hmm.

37:00.208 --> 37:01.997
So why would he
shoot Boseman?

37:02.526 --> 37:04.359
The shooter didn't even
get off the elevator.

37:04.427 --> 37:06.350
He just shot whoever
was in front of him.

37:06.443 --> 37:08.316
You think Boseman
was just unlucky?

37:08.384 --> 37:09.634
I do.

37:10.122 --> 37:12.947
What about Keith Fisk,
the TV writer.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.864
<i>We won for him,</i>

37:14.932 --> 37:16.403
but all he got was an apology.

37:16.471 --> 37:18.722
Eh, it doesn't seem like
the act of a TV writer.

37:18.790 --> 37:20.470
Really? It does to me.

37:20.538 --> 37:22.571
Guess we can
rule out Ruth Eastman.

37:22.866 --> 37:24.413
And Maia.

37:24.490 --> 37:26.041
Have we ever thought
it might be Sweeney?

37:26.108 --> 37:27.772
I mean, he is a wife-killer.

37:27.840 --> 37:30.760
Maybe, but there are two
I'd put at the top of the list:

37:30.982 --> 37:33.404
Dylan Stack and Felix Staples.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.432
Okay, where are they?

37:36.579 --> 37:37.832
Well, Stack <i> was</i> having

37:37.900 --> 37:39.737
<i>legal trouble because of us.</i>

37:40.549 --> 37:42.215
<i>He's fighting in federal court.</i>

37:42.283 --> 37:43.631
<i>And he's out on bail.</i>

37:43.766 --> 37:45.236
And Staples lost
his book deal.

37:45.304 --> 37:46.672
Could be either one.

37:48.042 --> 37:49.335
Something about the red scarf

37:49.403 --> 37:51.504
screams Felix Staples to me.

37:51.572 --> 37:53.198
No, they could sue
the person who leaked it.

37:53.265 --> 37:54.610
I'm just the citizen-journalist

37:54.678 --> 37:58.145
wanting to communicate it
to the world...

38:03.400 --> 38:05.345
Let's see what he's up to.

38:05.520 --> 38:07.704
Hey. You talked to Adrian?

38:07.772 --> 38:08.871
Yes.

38:08.939 --> 38:10.723
He tell you the assailant
was Caucasian?

38:11.509 --> 38:13.161
I'd rather not say.

38:13.526 --> 38:17.501
That would mean eliminating
half of our clients as suspects.

38:17.699 --> 38:19.764
- Possibly.
- No, definitely.

38:19.844 --> 38:22.019
Boseman might not be certain
of what he saw.

38:22.087 --> 38:23.411
He was in shock.

38:24.428 --> 38:25.794
Ian...

38:26.179 --> 38:29.822
you <i> are</i> using our client list
to find Adrian's killer, right?

38:30.244 --> 38:31.722
What else is there?

38:31.790 --> 38:33.200
Advancing your agenda.

38:33.268 --> 38:35.601
Given that someone
shot your partner,

38:36.281 --> 38:40.151
I would think that my
agenda is your agenda.

39:03.665 --> 39:05.145
Diane.

39:05.990 --> 39:07.918
There's a chance
I might've made a mistake,

39:07.986 --> 39:09.298
with the client list.

39:09.366 --> 39:10.533
What's going on
with our clients?

39:10.600 --> 39:12.327
Solomon is coming after them.

39:12.395 --> 39:14.560
We need to check in
with our top clients.

39:14.732 --> 39:17.428
Okay, well, uh,
I'll make some calls.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.304
- Uh, Julius
- and Lucca are

39:19.372 --> 39:21.053
splitting the list,
and seeing who's happy.

39:21.120 --> 39:22.449
Good, I'll, uh...

39:22.517 --> 39:23.817
I'll see what I can do.

39:24.033 --> 39:26.939
And, Diane,
I'm sorry about that.

39:28.105 --> 39:32.798
Hey, um, I-I haven't
been myself lately,

39:32.866 --> 39:37.234
so... I'm sorry about that, too.

39:37.623 --> 39:39.388
Well, you sound
like yourself today.

39:39.456 --> 39:40.699
I do, don't I?

39:40.969 --> 39:42.469
So let's start over.

39:42.734 --> 39:44.514
Yes. Good.

39:45.037 --> 39:46.764
It's a two-woman job.

39:47.372 --> 39:48.622
I'll talk to you.

39:48.794 --> 39:50.216
Very soon.

39:51.483 --> 39:52.673
Lucca.

39:52.790 --> 39:55.182
- Yeah.
- Can you ask Colin about

39:55.250 --> 39:57.352
Solomon's representation
of the DNC?

39:57.467 --> 39:59.099
I think we should go after them.

39:59.287 --> 40:02.301
Sure, but he won't have
any control over them.

40:02.402 --> 40:04.934
Well, he will,
now that they've endorsed him.

40:05.002 --> 40:06.073
Endorsed?

40:06.163 --> 40:08.379
Yes. The First
Congressional District.

40:08.447 --> 40:09.579
He didn't tell you?

40:09.647 --> 40:11.200
I just heard
from Julius.

40:11.582 --> 40:13.489
Anyway, can you talk to Colin?

40:13.557 --> 40:14.724
I think losing

40:14.792 --> 40:17.026
the Democratic business
would... would devastate him.

40:17.094 --> 40:19.096
Yeah.
I will.

40:23.165 --> 40:24.446
Solomon.

40:24.523 --> 40:26.413
- How are you?
- Good.

40:27.073 --> 40:29.274
You're a little tight
for space here.

40:29.411 --> 40:30.744
Well, it's temporary.

40:30.933 --> 40:33.604
May I also suggest
you use my offices?

40:33.769 --> 40:36.102
Two blocks away,
I've got more than enough space.

40:36.274 --> 40:39.897
Oh, good. It'll give us
a feel for the merger.

40:39.965 --> 40:41.510
Yes, exactly.

40:42.019 --> 40:43.933
So you had some thoughts
on the merger?

40:44.001 --> 40:45.925
I did.
What were they?

40:48.209 --> 40:52.508
Um, well, it's more visual
than verbal.

40:52.832 --> 40:54.262
Really?

40:54.723 --> 40:56.763
I'm intrigued. Let's see.

41:00.389 --> 41:02.056
We don't know each other
well enough

41:02.133 --> 41:03.516
for me to know
if you're kidding.

41:03.584 --> 41:05.169
You've been going
after our clients.

41:05.237 --> 41:06.669
That's not what I've been doing.

41:06.737 --> 41:08.459
You've even managed
to snare a few.

41:08.527 --> 41:10.682
Everything has been
totally above board.

41:10.750 --> 41:12.248
You figured
you could cherry-pick

41:12.316 --> 41:13.909
the most lucrative ones,

41:13.977 --> 41:17.256
dump the rest and, uh,
pick the carcass clean.

41:17.454 --> 41:18.935
- Where do you get this?
- The thing is,

41:19.002 --> 41:20.288
we are not a carcass.

41:20.356 --> 41:21.878
At the moment, we are reeling

41:22.013 --> 41:24.801
from our senior partner
getting shot,

41:25.456 --> 41:28.106
but we will recover,
and we will fight

41:28.174 --> 41:29.680
to hold onto
our own clients,

41:29.748 --> 41:34.795
and, just so you know,
we are coming after yours.

41:35.280 --> 41:37.555
- Now you're being silly.
- No.

41:38.165 --> 41:41.788
I realize it's all right
that the world is crazy,

41:42.360 --> 41:45.467
as long as I make my little
corner of the world sane.

41:45.535 --> 41:46.692
Diane...

41:46.760 --> 41:49.194
Now get the hell
out of my office.

42:18.146 --> 42:19.725
Lucca?

42:20.380 --> 42:21.925
You came.

42:22.033 --> 42:23.642
Of course I came,
you called.

42:23.753 --> 42:25.255
What do you need?

42:26.677 --> 42:28.067
Um...

42:38.004 --> 42:39.436
So, uh...

42:39.626 --> 42:40.627
What?

42:40.695 --> 42:42.979
You didn't tell me
about being a congressman.

42:43.274 --> 42:44.988
Oh, yeah, this morning.

42:45.056 --> 42:46.832
Well, technically,
I'm just endorsed.

42:46.900 --> 42:48.233
Not an actual
congressman.

42:48.343 --> 42:50.799
Colin, you're the only
Democrat running

42:50.867 --> 42:53.790
in Chicago's first
against a Nazi.

42:54.257 --> 42:56.821
You are a congressman.

42:57.686 --> 42:59.587
Congratulations.

43:00.107 --> 43:01.387
Thanks.

43:01.462 --> 43:02.595
And you didn't tell me.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.359
Yeah, well,
there was a lot going on.

43:05.740 --> 43:10.976
You asked me "What am I to you,"
and I didn't answer.

43:11.146 --> 43:12.545
No, yeah... you did.

43:12.622 --> 43:13.735
No.

43:14.137 --> 43:15.592
I didn't.

43:25.219 --> 43:26.652
Is that your answer?

43:27.238 --> 43:28.631
Yeah.

43:29.155 --> 43:32.722
Okay. Okay, I'm still confused,
but going with it.

43:32.887 --> 43:35.156
I need you to talk
to someone for me.

43:35.943 --> 43:37.224
Who?

43:37.292 --> 43:38.641
Frank Landau.

43:39.212 --> 43:41.223
Head of the Democratic
Committee.

43:43.275 --> 43:45.791
You really think
that's Felix Staples?

43:46.167 --> 43:47.300
Do you?

43:50.718 --> 43:52.990
I don't know, I mean,
Staples is all talk.

43:53.058 --> 43:55.157
He'd never fire a gun.

43:55.541 --> 43:58.551
"Please, Chicago:
more dead lawyers please."

44:00.038 --> 44:01.690
That's Felix?

44:01.856 --> 44:03.699
A tweet two weeks ago.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.532
Does he blame us
for losing his book deal?

44:05.600 --> 44:08.568
Well, yes, but I don't think
enough to kill.

44:08.963 --> 44:10.197
Is he in Chicago?

44:10.265 --> 44:11.318
Yeah.

44:11.386 --> 44:13.606
For a speech
at an alt-right fight club.

44:14.511 --> 44:16.077
Frank, what's the emergency?

44:16.145 --> 44:17.767
Oh, I just wanted to chat.

44:18.465 --> 44:19.892
Heard you were expanding here.

44:20.140 --> 44:21.847
- Thought I'd congratulate you.
- Yeah, I was gonna

44:21.914 --> 44:23.928
call you in the morning
and brief you on it.

44:24.427 --> 44:26.532
Anything that will embarrass
the Democratic Committee?

44:26.599 --> 44:27.756
No.

44:27.896 --> 44:30.641
More diverse clients,
more diverse lawyers.

44:30.712 --> 44:32.411
That's good for the Democrats.

44:32.667 --> 44:34.271
That's good for everyone.

44:34.979 --> 44:36.671
What about Lemond Bishop?

44:38.228 --> 44:39.913
What about him?

44:40.166 --> 44:42.978
I heard you signed
the top drug dealer in Chicago.

44:43.504 --> 44:45.490
I don't think that's quite true.

44:45.832 --> 44:47.265
You didn't sign
Lemond Bishop?

44:47.333 --> 44:49.713
No, I mean, he's not
the top drug dealer.

44:49.910 --> 44:51.376
He's moved on to other things.

44:51.444 --> 44:52.824
Bullshit.

44:53.490 --> 44:55.436
And what about
Colin Sweeney,

44:55.504 --> 44:57.469
the wife-killer,
did you sign him up, too?

44:57.572 --> 44:58.729
Who's telling you this?

44:58.797 --> 44:59.986
Does it matter?

45:00.752 --> 45:02.364
Is it true?

45:04.408 --> 45:06.335
You didn't think this would
be a conflict of interest?

45:06.402 --> 45:08.198
Frank,
let's talk about this tomorrow.

45:08.266 --> 45:09.813
No. I've had overtures

45:09.881 --> 45:11.914
from Diane Lockhart
at Reddick/Boseman.

45:12.291 --> 45:13.339
It might look good,

45:13.407 --> 45:16.063
being represented
by a black firm.

45:18.790 --> 45:20.074
<i>The question is,</i>

45:20.216 --> 45:21.743
do you want to marry?

45:21.814 --> 45:23.078
You're my addiction.

45:23.146 --> 45:24.483
What choice do I have?

45:24.551 --> 45:27.043
You have one choice.
No prenup,

45:27.111 --> 45:30.139
or I keep
the kayak exception.

45:30.307 --> 45:32.072
I'll have to ask my lawyer.

45:32.365 --> 45:34.446
No kayak exception.

45:34.613 --> 45:37.260
But we will allow a stipend
in the case of divorce

45:37.336 --> 45:39.335
that doubles
your current expense.

45:39.428 --> 45:41.493
But only if Sweeney doesn't die

45:41.666 --> 45:43.384
under suspicious
circumstances.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.394
Do we have an agreement?

45:46.220 --> 45:47.800
Okay.

45:55.911 --> 45:58.652
This, uh, bullshit
case against me.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.100
The foreign, uh...

46:00.209 --> 46:02.143
- Corrupt practices?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:02.348 --> 46:03.915
I want you to do it.

46:04.502 --> 46:05.955
You're fired.

46:06.631 --> 46:07.951
Come.

46:09.131 --> 46:10.387
Hello, ladies.

46:10.457 --> 46:12.606
Mr. Lester, it's
good to see you.

46:12.755 --> 46:15.013
I think you know
Liz Reddick.

46:15.081 --> 46:16.513
We've had dealings.

46:16.582 --> 46:18.852
No hard feelings, I hope.

46:20.011 --> 46:21.998
- Water under the bridge.
- Good.

46:22.176 --> 46:24.927
I've done things in my
life I'm not proud of,

46:25.147 --> 46:28.344
but I want you to know
I've turned over a new leaf.

46:28.465 --> 46:29.935
It's a new me.

46:30.639 --> 46:32.119
Good to know.

46:33.311 --> 46:35.856
Uh, so what can we do
for you, Mr. Lester?

46:36.036 --> 46:37.147
Very simply,

46:37.215 --> 46:39.286
we don't need our files
sent anywhere.

46:39.354 --> 46:40.778
We think we acted
too harshly.

46:40.846 --> 46:42.375
We're staying.

46:42.863 --> 46:45.570
Come on, don't play hard to get.

46:45.874 --> 46:47.706
We have a lot of business here.

46:48.849 --> 46:50.288
You're right.

46:50.488 --> 46:51.592
Thank Mr. Bishop

46:51.660 --> 46:52.984
for staying loyal.

46:53.067 --> 46:54.857
We have a bright future
in front of us.

46:54.938 --> 46:56.176
How could we not?

46:56.436 --> 46:58.127
Great to see you all.

47:02.277 --> 47:03.504
Thank you.

47:03.572 --> 47:06.997
Hey, just a part of being
a defense attorney.

47:10.389 --> 47:11.669
Are you going to the hospital?

47:11.746 --> 47:12.801
Oh, yeah.

47:12.869 --> 47:14.108
- You, too?
- Yes.

47:14.239 --> 47:15.562
I'll drive.

47:16.973 --> 47:18.460
Okay.
