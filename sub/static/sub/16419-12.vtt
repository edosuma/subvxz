WEBVTT

00:14.379 --> 00:15.550
- Okaaay, now tell me
what you think

00:15.551 --> 00:17.136
of this artwork
for our new game.

00:17.137 --> 00:18.723
- Artwork for our new game!

00:18.724 --> 00:19.895
Let's see it.

00:19.896 --> 00:22.274
- Okay...

00:22.275 --> 00:24.412
Unicorn on the Cob.

00:24.413 --> 00:25.688
- Okay.
The design's cool, but...

00:25.689 --> 00:27.895
I think our game
needs a better name.

00:27.896 --> 00:30.240
- Dude, it's a game
about corn on the cob

00:30.241 --> 00:31.895
and a unicorn.

00:31.896 --> 00:35.861
What name could be better
than "Unicorn on the Cob?"

00:35.862 --> 00:40.102
- How 'bout...
"Melvin's Magic Niblets."

00:40.103 --> 00:42.757
- Oh c'mon.
"Melvin's Magic Niblets?"

00:42.758 --> 00:43.964
- Yeah!

00:43.965 --> 00:45.585
The unicorn's name is Melvin.

00:45.586 --> 00:46.999
- Mnugh...

00:47.000 --> 00:49.550
- And "niblets"
is a funny word for corn.

00:49.551 --> 00:52.067
- Whatever dude, it's still
nowhere near as good

00:52.068 --> 00:54.274
as Unicorn on the Cob.

00:54.275 --> 00:56.343
- Well, that's just
your opinion.

00:56.344 --> 00:59.654
And y'know, you're not
always right, little girl.

00:59.655 --> 01:03.447
- I know... that's why
Kenzie and I've been thinkin'

01:03.448 --> 01:05.343
about hiring some focus groups.

01:05.344 --> 01:06.619
- What are focus groups?

01:06.620 --> 01:07.861
- Y'know, people
that you bring in

01:07.862 --> 01:09.447
to test your game
and then they tell you,

01:09.448 --> 01:11.343
what's good and bad about it.

01:11.344 --> 01:12.930
- But... But that's whatcha got
me and Hudson for.

01:12.931 --> 01:15.137
- Well, I'm glad I got
you guys for somethin'.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.826
- Yo Hudson!

01:19.827 --> 01:21.999
What do you think
about callin' our new game:

01:22.000 --> 01:25.274
Melvin's Magic Niblets?

01:25.275 --> 01:27.654
- I'm sorry, what?

01:27.655 --> 01:29.792
- Hudson...
what are you eating?!?

01:29.793 --> 01:32.240
- Sour cream.

01:32.241 --> 01:36.067
- Well, y'know, we have spoons.

01:36.068 --> 01:39.585
- I got five spoons, right here.

01:39.586 --> 01:41.240
- That's nice.

01:41.241 --> 01:43.516
Oh hey, in case I forget...
- Yeah?

01:43.517 --> 01:45.655
- Remind me not
to smell your hand.

01:48.724 --> 01:51.447
- Hi. I can't talk.
I need soap.

01:51.448 --> 01:52.688
Where's the anti-bacterial soap?

01:52.689 --> 01:56.136
Move!

01:56.137 --> 01:58.274
- Uhhh... Why are you
washing your hands

01:58.275 --> 02:00.379
like you just finished a murder?

02:02.103 --> 02:03.447
- I'm washing my hands

02:03.448 --> 02:04.723
because I made
the terrible mistake

02:04.724 --> 02:06.619
of using the restroom
in the subway.

02:06.620 --> 02:10.343
- Ewww, noooo!
- Awww!

02:10.344 --> 02:11.895
- Dude! Everybody knows

02:11.896 --> 02:13.516
you don't use public
bathrooms in New York!

02:13.517 --> 02:15.516
- Especially in the subway...

02:15.517 --> 02:17.999
Oh God, especially
in the subway.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.136
- Ugh...

02:19.137 --> 02:20.447
- Yeah. do you know what kinda

02:20.448 --> 02:23.448
freaks and weirdos
use those bathrooms?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.964
- Well, you know,
you should have used that app.

02:27.965 --> 02:29.585
- What app?
- Air TnP.

02:29.586 --> 02:30.999
- Yeah, Air TnP.
- Uh-huh, Air TnP.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.171
- What's Air TnP?

02:33.172 --> 02:34.550
- Look. See...
People all over New York

02:34.551 --> 02:36.102
put their bathrooms on here,

02:36.103 --> 02:37.792
then you just tap,
and it finds the closest one

02:37.793 --> 02:38.930
to where you are.

02:38.931 --> 02:40.688
- Yeah, and then you
just pay a small fee

02:40.689 --> 02:42.861
to use a nice, clean bathroom.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.033
- Ahehehehe...

02:44.034 --> 02:45.448
A pee fee.

02:48.448 --> 02:51.274
- Heyyy...
y'know how you were sayin'

02:51.275 --> 02:52.619
we should hire
some focus groups,

02:52.620 --> 02:54.102
to give us their opinion
on our games?

02:54.103 --> 02:55.792
- Yeah?
- Well...

02:55.793 --> 02:57.964
we could put our bathroom
on Air TnP,

02:57.965 --> 02:59.930
and then, when people come
here to use it...

02:59.931 --> 03:01.517
- We kidnap 'em!

03:03.344 --> 03:05.102
- Orrrrr...

03:05.103 --> 03:06.378
- Or, we give 'em Pear Pads,

03:06.379 --> 03:08.343
let 'em test our games,

03:08.344 --> 03:09.688
then they give us
their feedback.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.102
- Yeah!

03:11.103 --> 03:13.585
And Game Shakers makes
a little extra cash-sheesh,

03:13.586 --> 03:14.999
rentin' out our bathroom.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.895
- Ohhh-kaaaay.
But don't be surprised

03:16.896 --> 03:18.550
when a bunch of crazy
New York weirdos

03:18.551 --> 03:19.826
start showing up here.

03:19.827 --> 03:22.412
- Ahahaha...
Attention everybody!

03:22.413 --> 03:25.240
Attention everybody!

03:25.241 --> 03:27.240
- Hey Dad, what's up?
- What's up?

03:27.241 --> 03:28.999
Hey Bunny, tell 'em what's up!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.343
- Okay.
Everybody...

03:31.344 --> 03:33.861
Dub's new album
just hit number one!

03:33.862 --> 03:35.378
- What, no way!
- That's amazing!

03:35.379 --> 03:36.688
- Shut up, for real?!?

03:36.689 --> 03:37.620
- That's right!

03:37.621 --> 03:39.171
Everybody loves my new album!

03:39.172 --> 03:40.758
I'm the best!

03:42.827 --> 03:43.895
Uhhh... huh,

03:43.896 --> 03:45.585
not everybody loves
your new album.

03:45.586 --> 03:47.517
- Wait, what...
What are you sayin'?

03:49.068 --> 03:52.171
- I'm lookin' online
at comments from people,

03:52.172 --> 03:53.550
and some aren't so nice.

03:53.551 --> 03:55.205
- Oh...
Oh really?

03:55.206 --> 03:56.516
Well, why don't you just
read me some a'them comments.

03:56.517 --> 03:58.654
- Wait.
Nah-nah-nah-nah...

03:58.655 --> 04:00.861
don't read him any mean
comments about his new album.

04:00.862 --> 04:01.895
- Well why not?

04:01.896 --> 04:05.412
I can handle a little criticism.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.067
- Okay...
Here, this one says...

04:07.068 --> 04:10.447
"Double G's new album
is the perfect thing to get..."

04:10.448 --> 04:11.654
- A'ho!
All right, that's cool.

04:11.655 --> 04:12.895
- "...for someone you hate."

04:12.896 --> 04:15.205
- Ewmmm...

04:15.206 --> 04:16.654
No, no. It's okay.
It's okay.

04:16.655 --> 04:18.861
Read me another one.

04:18.862 --> 04:20.688
- Okay..."Last night,
my little brother

04:20.689 --> 04:22.067
was up all night, vomiting."

04:22.068 --> 04:23.481
- And, and?

04:23.482 --> 04:25.447
- "His vomiting
sounded way better

04:25.448 --> 04:27.689
than Double G's new album."

04:29.586 --> 04:30.999
- All right.
Well, c-can I see that?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.999
I just want to see it
a little closer

04:33.000 --> 04:34.724
to make sure
that everything's... ahhhh!!!

04:37.344 --> 04:39.757
- Whoops!

04:39.758 --> 04:41.171
- It really hurts me to witness

04:41.172 --> 04:43.861
violence against technology.

04:43.862 --> 04:46.757
- I told you he can't
take criticism.

04:46.758 --> 04:47.689
- Yes I can!

04:47.690 --> 04:49.309
Just not from a buncha

04:49.310 --> 04:51.136
nasty little internet cowards...

04:51.137 --> 04:54.792
typin' and tappin' all
their lil' sassy comments,

04:54.793 --> 04:56.895
"I don't like this
and I don't like that."

04:56.896 --> 04:58.481
Na na na na...

04:58.482 --> 05:00.619
- Okay, why don't you just admit

05:00.620 --> 05:02.343
that you can't take criticism?

05:02.344 --> 05:05.999
- 'Cuz I can...
And I'll prove it!

05:06.000 --> 05:10.033
- Alright, "Anybody who
doesn't like my new album...

05:10.034 --> 05:12.102
meet me at Double
Money Records...

05:12.103 --> 05:14.274
tomorrow at 6 PM...

05:14.275 --> 05:16.274
and I'll be happy
to listen to any criticism

05:16.275 --> 05:17.861
that you have."

05:17.862 --> 05:20.205
- Uh-uh Dub,
don't you post that!

05:20.206 --> 05:21.447
- Too late!

05:21.448 --> 05:22.550
Already posted.

05:22.551 --> 05:23.964
- Ah geez.
- Ohhh man.

05:23.965 --> 05:25.654
- No no Dub, whyyy?

05:25.655 --> 05:28.102
- Oh, hey...

05:28.103 --> 05:29.240

- Corn's too small.

06:18.379 --> 06:20.688
- What... No it's not.

06:20.689 --> 06:23.000
- C'mon.
This is America.

06:25.931 --> 06:27.999
- Uh, hi...
excuse me...

06:28.000 --> 06:29.895
is this...
Game Shakers?

06:29.896 --> 06:31.930
- Uh, yeah.
Can we help you?

06:31.931 --> 06:32.896
- I hope so.

06:32.897 --> 06:34.585
I found this place on Air TnP.

06:34.586 --> 06:36.412
- Oh really?
- You did?

06:36.413 --> 06:37.516
- Yeah yeah.
Where's the bathroom?

06:37.517 --> 06:39.102
- Oh! Um, it is right back...

06:39.103 --> 06:40.655
- I'll find it!!!

06:45.379 --> 06:46.999
- Hi! And thank you
for using

06:47.000 --> 06:48.412
the Game Shakers bathroom
while playing our new game.

06:48.413 --> 06:49.793
I'll take your Pear Pad.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.136
- Aw man, a line!

06:54.137 --> 06:56.619
- Just wait there, please.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.274
So, how was your experience?

06:58.275 --> 07:01.274
- Uh, it was cool.

07:01.275 --> 07:03.757
Good toilet.

07:03.758 --> 07:06.619
- No. I meant our game,
Unicorn on the Cob.

07:06.620 --> 07:10.516
- Ohhh.
Really fun game.

07:10.517 --> 07:12.792
- "Really fun game."

07:12.793 --> 07:14.205
And any specific comments?

07:14.206 --> 07:15.481
- Uh, yeah.

07:15.482 --> 07:17.067
The corn on the cob
was too small.

07:17.068 --> 07:19.861
- Interesting.

07:19.862 --> 07:21.550
- Hey, can I please go in?!?

07:21.551 --> 07:23.102
- No!

07:23.103 --> 07:24.205
You. Tan jacket.

07:24.206 --> 07:27.619
Get in there
and do your business.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.000
- All right.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.378
- Welcome to
the Game Shakers bathroom.

07:36.379 --> 07:38.481
- Uhhh o-okay.

07:38.482 --> 07:42.757
- Would you like to enhance
your restroom experience?

07:42.758 --> 07:44.688
- Well... The girl
out there told me

07:44.689 --> 07:46.688
I should play this game,
Unicorn on the Cob.

07:46.689 --> 07:48.136
- Right, that's true.

07:48.137 --> 07:50.136
But we also have...

07:50.137 --> 07:52.619
cologne...
antiperspirant...

07:52.620 --> 07:56.517
tweezers...
Dub Wipes...

07:57.827 --> 08:01.343
and... cups of salad.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.792
- No thanks.

08:02.793 --> 08:04.861
I just need to...
y'know.

08:04.862 --> 08:07.655
- I hear ya.
Go for it.

08:14.379 --> 08:16.757
- Are you gonna leave?

08:16.758 --> 08:20.033
- Oh... No.

08:20.034 --> 08:23.205
I'll be right here,
in case you need something.

08:23.206 --> 08:24.723
- But... I uhhh...

08:24.724 --> 08:28.241
- Noooo worries.
I'm very discreet.

08:38.241 --> 08:40.033
- Hey Dub!
- Hmm?

08:40.034 --> 08:42.378
These burgers and dogs'll
be ready in a few minutes!

08:42.379 --> 08:45.205
- Ah cool, cool.

08:45.206 --> 08:46.343
- Listen, Dad.

08:46.344 --> 08:47.792
Your album is a huge hit.

08:47.793 --> 08:49.274
- Ahhh...
Yeah, I know that.

08:49.275 --> 08:50.826
- Then why do you
wanna bring strangers in here,

08:50.827 --> 08:52.412
from the internet,
to throw shade on it...

08:52.413 --> 08:53.861
- 'Cuz!

08:53.862 --> 08:56.792
I wanna prove to you,
and everybody else,

08:56.793 --> 08:58.619
that these internet butt-chumps

08:58.620 --> 09:00.895
don't have the ding-dongs

09:00.896 --> 09:03.000
to criticize
my album to my face.

09:05.275 --> 09:07.343
- But, I mean, if you think
about it your album's...

09:07.344 --> 09:09.516
- Ruthless!
Tell Bunny to bring in

09:09.517 --> 09:11.481
the first butt-chump.

09:11.482 --> 09:13.343
- Yo Bunny!

09:13.344 --> 09:15.344
- Aw. This won't go well.

09:16.586 --> 09:18.378
- Ooh, look at this.

09:18.379 --> 09:20.964
- Double G, this is Garbin.

09:20.965 --> 09:24.343
- Well, Garbin...

09:24.344 --> 09:26.378
Nice of you to stop by.

09:26.379 --> 09:28.343
- Yeah okay.

09:28.344 --> 09:30.757
- Run Garbin.

09:30.758 --> 09:31.930
- Don't pay attention to Trip,

09:31.931 --> 09:33.757
he has emotional problems.

09:33.758 --> 09:34.758
- Dad! I do not
have emotional...

09:34.759 --> 09:37.481
- Hey! Hey!

09:37.482 --> 09:39.516
Now Garbin...

09:39.517 --> 09:41.654
I hear you went online

09:41.655 --> 09:42.930
and wrote some "unkind words"

09:42.931 --> 09:44.171
about my new album.

09:44.172 --> 09:46.274
- Yeah man.

09:46.275 --> 09:49.171
- Well, now that you're not
hidin' behind your keyboard...

09:49.172 --> 09:51.757
why don't you tell me,
to my face,

09:51.758 --> 09:54.102
the "issues" you have
with my new album.

09:54.103 --> 09:57.344
- Sure.
It's suckish.

09:59.551 --> 10:01.172
- That's all!!!

10:02.931 --> 10:05.343
- Run Garbin, Run!
- Don't look back!

10:05.344 --> 10:06.931
- I warned you!
- You have to survive!

10:08.724 --> 10:10.447
- Oh my gosh, I mean it...

10:10.448 --> 10:11.688
I really loved your game.

10:11.689 --> 10:13.136
- Cool.
And did you have some salad?

10:13.137 --> 10:14.895
- Oh yeah!
It was all just

10:14.896 --> 10:18.516
a fantastic bathroom experience.

10:18.517 --> 10:19.792
- Oh, you're sweet.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.275
I'll take the Pear Pad.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.620
- Thank you.

10:28.620 --> 10:29.965
- What a nice, classy lady.

10:32.931 --> 10:35.516
- Yeah. So, how many people
used our bathroom today?

10:35.517 --> 10:38.481
- Uhhhmmm... 57...

10:38.482 --> 10:40.516
and they all gave us really good
feedback on our game.

10:40.517 --> 10:41.792
- Cool, so what's next?

10:41.793 --> 10:43.654
- I just gotta
plug in these Pear Pads

10:43.655 --> 10:45.550
that our Air TnP customers used,

10:45.551 --> 10:48.240
and download their
dynamic variable analytics.

10:48.241 --> 10:51.619
- As long as you
know what that means.

10:54.413 --> 10:55.413
- Whoa whoa what what...

10:55.414 --> 10:56.930
- What's wrong?

10:56.931 --> 10:58.688
- No way, no way...

10:58.689 --> 11:00.102
- What happened?!?

11:00.103 --> 11:01.826
- I think that one
of our Air TnP customers

11:01.827 --> 11:04.654
uploaded a virus
on to our Pear Pad!

11:04.655 --> 11:06.964
- Oh come on.
- I'm serious!

11:06.965 --> 11:08.378
You see that red code?

11:08.379 --> 11:10.343
That's a virus, and...

11:10.344 --> 11:11.895
Uh-oh...
- What-oh?

11:11.896 --> 11:13.895
- I... I can't
get into our game.

11:13.896 --> 11:16.171
I'm locked out.

11:16.172 --> 11:17.688
- Wait, so you're
saying that we've been...

11:17.689 --> 11:19.723
- Sabotaged!

11:19.724 --> 11:21.723
- Oh my g... Oh my God!

11:21.724 --> 11:22.757
Somebody's trying
to kill our game.

11:22.758 --> 11:24.171
- I knew it.

11:24.172 --> 11:25.826
I knew this Air TnP thing
was a bad idea.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.930
Come on!
We gotta shut it down right now.

11:27.931 --> 11:32.033
- No no no no no no no no...

11:32.034 --> 11:33.447
We gotta keep it going.

11:33.448 --> 11:34.516
- But we've been hacked!

11:34.517 --> 11:35.964
- Yeah, we know that

11:35.965 --> 11:38.102
but whoever sabotaged us
doesn't know.

11:38.103 --> 11:39.034
- So?

11:39.035 --> 11:40.654
- Sooo, if we put up a post

11:40.655 --> 11:42.102
saying that everything's fine,

11:42.103 --> 11:44.861
I guarantee you
that whoever sabotaged our game

11:44.862 --> 11:46.205
will come back and try again.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.550
- Ooo.
So, we're setting a trap.

11:48.551 --> 11:50.033
- Uh-huh.
- Good.

11:50.034 --> 11:52.068
Cuz I like traps.

11:54.793 --> 11:56.723
- How! Dare! You!

11:56.724 --> 11:58.343
Criti! Size!
My! Album!

11:58.344 --> 11:59.310
- Dad, get off of him!

11:59.311 --> 12:01.550
- Hey! Hey!
Wait a minute son.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.274
Daddy's busy.

12:03.275 --> 12:05.826
People! Are!
Talkin'! Grammy!

12:05.827 --> 12:07.378
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

12:07.379 --> 12:10.240
Will you pull my dad
off a'that rabbi?!?

12:10.241 --> 12:12.550
- I can't! Dub told me
to cook these burgers!

12:12.551 --> 12:14.447
- D'awwww!

12:14.448 --> 12:17.448
BUNNY!!!
Bunny, help!

12:21.896 --> 12:23.447
- Dang it!

12:23.448 --> 12:26.033
- I'm really sorry
about that, Rabbi Moyl.

12:26.034 --> 12:27.895
- It's all right.

12:27.896 --> 12:29.309
I forgive Double G.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.412
- Ahhhh...

12:30.413 --> 12:33.136
He doesn't know squat about rap!

12:33.137 --> 12:35.895
- Well, I do know that...

12:35.896 --> 12:37.896
YOUR ALBUM IS DREK!

12:40.034 --> 12:41.517
- Hey!
- Let me at him!

12:44.137 --> 12:45.309
- Burgers are done!!!

12:45.310 --> 12:47.000
- Ooo, burgers.
- Let's eat.

12:51.517 --> 12:54.136
- No. No. You're makin'
the corn too small.

12:54.137 --> 12:56.723
- Well the corn cob can't
be bigger than the unicorn.

12:56.724 --> 12:58.861
- Says who?
- I don't know.

12:58.862 --> 13:01.000
Says the laws of animals
and vegetables.

13:05.379 --> 13:08.136
- Uh, hi... I found
this place on Air TnP?

13:08.137 --> 13:10.999
- Uh yeah... the bathroom's
back through there.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.379
- Cool, thanks.

13:14.724 --> 13:15.999
- I bet he's the hacker.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.033
Did you see
how jittery he looked?

13:17.034 --> 13:18.516
- Well, he came here

13:18.517 --> 13:20.516
'cuz he's desperate
for a bathroom.

13:20.517 --> 13:23.172
- Yeah, I still think
he might be the guy.

13:25.034 --> 13:26.619
- Well, don't worry...

13:26.620 --> 13:29.102
'Cuz I installed an alarm
on every Pear Pad

13:29.103 --> 13:30.861
that our bathroom
customers are using.

13:30.862 --> 13:33.378
- We have an alarm?
- Yeah.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.757
If anybody tries
to upload anything,

13:35.758 --> 13:37.895
we'll hear a loud alert sound.

13:39.448 --> 13:41.619
- What, you mean like that?
- Uh-huh...

13:41.620 --> 13:43.964
So just stop worrying
so much about every...

13:43.965 --> 13:45.310
- Alarm!!!
- Ah!!

13:47.103 --> 13:48.619
- Let me out!

13:48.620 --> 13:50.654
- Hey! What happened?!?
- Who's in our bathroom?!?

13:50.655 --> 13:51.757
- I don't know!

13:51.758 --> 13:53.274
- How can you not know?!?

13:53.275 --> 13:56.275
- Sorry! I was busy
making that guy a salad!

13:59.413 --> 14:00.999
- All right...
Let's just open the door,

14:01.000 --> 14:02.585
and then all three
of us'll jump him!

14:02.586 --> 14:03.757
- What? No!

14:03.758 --> 14:04.895
- We're not prepared for this.

14:04.896 --> 14:06.067
- All right, uh...

14:06.068 --> 14:07.068
we need a weapon.

14:07.069 --> 14:09.965
- But... Ooo!

14:15.103 --> 14:16.999
- Okay, why do you have

14:17.000 --> 14:18.516
a stick with nails
in your purse?

14:18.517 --> 14:20.136
- My mom makes me
take it with me

14:20.137 --> 14:22.205
when I ride the subway alone.

14:22.206 --> 14:23.792
- Uh, I don't know
how much longer

14:23.793 --> 14:25.171
I can hold this!

14:25.172 --> 14:26.482
- Yeah, neither do I.

14:29.517 --> 14:31.205
- All right, ready?!?

14:31.206 --> 14:35.654
- One... Two... three!

14:35.655 --> 14:38.241
- Ahhh!!!

14:41.482 --> 14:44.034
- Okay, what's goin' on,
he's really cute.

14:52.379 --> 14:54.412
- Okay, you tell us why
you were in our bathroom,

14:54.413 --> 14:56.481
and what you were
uploading to our Pear Pad!

14:56.482 --> 14:58.965
- Yeah, and tell us
if you have a girlfriend!

15:01.103 --> 15:02.930
- Why do we need to know that?

15:02.931 --> 15:04.343
- I'm curious!

15:04.344 --> 15:06.102
- Uh, is that a stick
with nails in it?

15:06.103 --> 15:08.619
- Sure is!
And you better start talkin'

15:08.620 --> 15:10.102
unless you want
a free colonoscopy.

15:10.103 --> 15:12.102
- Whoa kid.
- Geezers.

15:12.103 --> 15:13.136
- Alright,
I'm gettin' outta here.

15:13.137 --> 15:15.274
- Ahhh-ahhh-ahhh!

15:15.275 --> 15:16.826
- Geez!
Why are you guys hasslin' me?!?

15:16.827 --> 15:19.171
- 'Cuz, somebody was in
that bathroom the other day,

15:19.172 --> 15:21.688
with our Pear Pad,
and they uploaded a virus.

15:21.689 --> 15:23.378
- And it was you!

15:23.379 --> 15:25.654
- Pffft. You guys can't
prove I uploaded anything.

15:25.655 --> 15:27.654
- We can too!

15:27.655 --> 15:29.309
Can we?

15:29.310 --> 15:31.274
- Yeah. 'Cuz we rigged
THAT Pear Pad to signal us

15:31.275 --> 15:33.240
if someone tried
to hack us again.

15:33.241 --> 15:34.619
- Which you just did.

15:34.620 --> 15:37.205
Unless it was
your girlfriend who did it.

15:37.206 --> 15:38.930
- I don't have a girlfriend.

15:38.931 --> 15:41.999
- Heh, well dude
we gotta fix that.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.378
- All right,
quit flirting with him!

15:43.379 --> 15:44.792
He's a bad person.

15:44.793 --> 15:46.964
- Look...
I'm not a bad person, okay?

15:46.965 --> 15:48.136
I never wanted to...

15:48.137 --> 15:50.757
I never wanted to hurt an...

15:50.758 --> 15:52.654
I didn't wanna do it!

15:57.275 --> 16:00.102
- Okay, what are you
talking about?

16:00.103 --> 16:03.723
- Hey easy easy,
can't you see he's upset?

16:03.724 --> 16:06.102
It's okay buddy,
what's your name?

16:06.103 --> 16:07.930
- Jake.
- Okay, Jake.

16:07.931 --> 16:09.654
His name's Jake.

16:09.655 --> 16:13.171
Just talk to me, Jake,
it'll be okay.

16:13.172 --> 16:16.586
- Wow. Watching guys cry
makes me sick.

16:17.551 --> 16:19.655
I'm gonna get some salad.

16:22.241 --> 16:23.826
- My dad made me do it.

16:23.827 --> 16:26.343
- Your dad?

16:26.344 --> 16:28.102
- Yeah. He's the president
of Bodacious Games.

16:28.103 --> 16:29.481
- Bodacious Games?

16:29.482 --> 16:32.033
- One of our competitors.
- I know.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.343
Oh my God.

16:33.344 --> 16:35.378
So your dad sent
you here to hack us?

16:35.379 --> 16:36.792
- Yeah. Cuz...
you Game Shakers...

16:36.793 --> 16:38.481
your games
have been crushin' it.

16:38.482 --> 16:40.550
Like, super popular.

16:40.551 --> 16:42.654
And my dad's company hasn't
been doin' too good lately.

16:42.655 --> 16:44.619
- So, he made you sabotage us,

16:44.620 --> 16:46.378
by locking us out
of our new game?

16:46.379 --> 16:49.102
- Yeah.
I'm so ashamed!

16:52.172 --> 16:54.757
- Okay, well why don't you
stop crying like a ballerina,

16:54.758 --> 16:57.792
and just give us the code
so we can access our game.

16:57.793 --> 16:59.826
- I can't!
Only my dad has the code.

16:59.827 --> 17:01.378
- Well, okay...

17:01.379 --> 17:05.033
- Just take your phone here...
call your dad...

17:05.034 --> 17:06.861
and tell him to come here
to Game Shakers...

17:06.862 --> 17:09.343
'kay cute thing?

17:09.344 --> 17:10.723
- Okay. I'll call him.

17:10.724 --> 17:12.448
- Good.

17:13.517 --> 17:14.999
- What are you doin'?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.136
- Oh, one sec, I'm just adding

17:16.137 --> 17:17.274
my contact info to your phone.

17:17.275 --> 17:18.620
Just real quick...

17:20.172 --> 17:22.379
- Eh, but but...
- Shh... It's okay.

17:29.586 --> 17:31.102
- There.

17:31.103 --> 17:34.481
- Now you're tied up.

17:34.482 --> 17:37.551
- Yeah. And now...

17:42.275 --> 17:44.964
- Just makin' sure
he doesn't get away.

17:44.965 --> 17:47.033
- But we tied him up.

17:47.034 --> 17:48.274
- He can't get away.

17:48.275 --> 17:49.792
- Okay, will you
guys just let me

17:49.793 --> 17:52.895
participate the way
I wanna participate?

17:52.896 --> 17:54.620
- All right...
- Daddy!

17:56.344 --> 17:58.688
- Jake?!?

17:58.689 --> 18:01.343
Hey... why is
my kid tied up?

18:01.344 --> 18:05.447
- Uh...'Cuz we caught
your hot son here

18:05.448 --> 18:07.240
uploading a virus to our server.

18:07.241 --> 18:09.136
- Awww, now...

18:09.137 --> 18:13.000
why would my kid wanna do
somethin' like that?

18:14.586 --> 18:16.826
- It's over, Dad!
I told 'em!

18:16.827 --> 18:19.516
I told 'em that your
game company isn't doin' good,

18:19.517 --> 18:21.723
and that's why you made me
hack the Game Shakers!

18:21.724 --> 18:23.689
Ahhhh!

18:26.310 --> 18:29.033
- Why'd you tell 'em that?!?

18:29.034 --> 18:31.482
- They-they had a scary stick!

18:33.379 --> 18:36.481
- Now, we want the code.

18:36.482 --> 18:41.000
- Well, I don't know nothin'
'bout no codes.

18:43.448 --> 18:45.343
- Oh, is that so?

18:45.344 --> 18:48.999
- What's up!?!
- Hiyoooo!!!

18:49.000 --> 18:50.378
- Double G?

18:50.379 --> 18:52.447
- Yeah, I thought you
might know who I am.

18:52.448 --> 18:54.205
Now, my business
partners here tell me

18:54.206 --> 18:56.274
that you sabotaged Game Shakers.

18:56.275 --> 18:57.447
- It's true!

18:57.448 --> 19:00.412
It happened in our restroom!

19:00.413 --> 19:04.550
And his son still owes me
for half a salad.

19:04.551 --> 19:06.757
- Yeah! And now we can't
access our new game

19:06.758 --> 19:09.688
unless he gives us the code.

19:09.689 --> 19:11.516
- Oh don't worry about that...

19:11.517 --> 19:13.136
He's gonna give us the code.

19:13.137 --> 19:14.792
- And if I don't,

19:14.793 --> 19:17.033
what are you gonna do?
Torture me?

19:17.034 --> 19:19.723
By making me listen
to your new album?

19:19.724 --> 19:21.999
- Ohhhhh!!!!!
- Awww shoooot.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.102
- Bang!
- Oooohhh!

19:24.103 --> 19:26.102
- Boom goes the dynamite!

19:26.103 --> 19:27.861
- Uh... Look dawg.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.826
My dad already roughed
up a rabbi today

19:29.827 --> 19:32.619
so if I were you
I'd watch my mouth.

19:32.620 --> 19:34.792
- Hey Dub!
I bet you he'll give us the code

19:34.793 --> 19:36.655
if we take him for a ride
in your helicopter.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.550
- Helicopter?

19:45.551 --> 19:47.861
- Noooooo!!!
Noooo, please!!!

19:47.862 --> 19:50.654
Don't push me
outta this helicopter!!!

19:50.655 --> 19:53.240
- Ahahahahah!!!
- Hey Dub!

19:53.241 --> 19:55.585
We're about 10,000 feet high!

19:55.586 --> 19:58.033
- Yep! I think it's
time to push this jerk

19:58.034 --> 19:59.550
outta the helicopter!

19:59.551 --> 20:00.964
- No no no no, please please!

20:00.965 --> 20:03.447
- Well then...
We're gonna need that code.

20:03.448 --> 20:05.895
- You better tell us the code!

20:05.896 --> 20:10.033
- Hey! How do you guys
want your hamburgers cooked?

20:10.034 --> 20:12.240
- Shhhh...
- Shhhh...

20:12.241 --> 20:15.033
- What's the code?!?

20:15.034 --> 20:18.309
- Um... are you sure this isn't
a little too crazy?

20:18.310 --> 20:20.033
- Nah. When I was little,

20:20.034 --> 20:22.930
this is how my dad tricked me
into eatin' my vegetables.

20:22.931 --> 20:26.067
- This buttchump doesn't
wanna give us the code,

20:26.068 --> 20:28.619
then push him
outta the helicopter!

20:28.620 --> 20:30.930
- Okay Dub!
- You got it!

20:30.931 --> 20:32.378
- 8 6 7 5 3 0 9!

20:32.379 --> 20:37.379
That's the code!
8 6 7 5 3 0 9

20:38.275 --> 20:39.723
- Got it!

20:39.724 --> 20:43.619
- Now please land
this helicopter!

20:43.620 --> 20:45.550
- All right, sure thing.
But first...

20:45.551 --> 20:48.378
How'd you like my new album?

20:48.379 --> 20:51.412
- Uh, your new album
is the best album

20:51.413 --> 20:53.481
in the whole wide world!

20:53.482 --> 20:56.309
- Awww, that's very sweet
of you to say.

20:56.310 --> 20:58.136
Now push 'em out!

20:58.137 --> 20:59.965
- Bye bye!!!
- Geronimo!

21:08.896 --> 21:11.723
- I wasn't even in a helicopter?

21:11.724 --> 21:13.827
- Nope!
- Stupid!

21:17.758 --> 21:20.067
- Well, now that you
got the code, now what?

21:20.068 --> 21:21.999
- I'll just call Babe,
have her put in the code...

21:22.000 --> 21:24.344
and make sure
we're back in action!

21:29.137 --> 21:31.723
- So yeah, it's really cool
running my own business.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.757
But, y'know, one day
I'd love to do some traveling...

21:33.758 --> 21:36.654
you know maybe to Japan,
or France.

21:36.655 --> 21:40.309
Do you like to travel...
with me?

21:40.310 --> 21:41.930
- Just... please let me go.

21:41.931 --> 21:44.550
- Shhhhh.

21:44.551 --> 21:46.344
Eat your corn.

22:03.275 --> 22:05.792
Mmm.

22:05.793 --> 22:08.724
