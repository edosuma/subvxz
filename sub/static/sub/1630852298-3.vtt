WEBVTT

00:11.311 --> 00:13.281
I've never met Glen
or Beth A before.

00:13.381 --> 00:17.217
Beth A is Irene's replacement
when she went and got married.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.652
Glen, I remember going,

00:18.751 --> 00:20.788
"That's who they chose
to replace me?"

00:20.888 --> 00:23.291
-Nice to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

00:23.390 --> 00:24.391
[Irene] Incoming message.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.094
Don't do that! I swear to God!

00:27.195 --> 00:32.100
Y'all did not know that I was
popping laxatives, throwing up.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.667
I was dealing with some shit!

00:33.767 --> 00:36.969
You sitting here laughing,
it's still not funny.

00:37.070 --> 00:40.841
And the two people who came to
talk to me don't even know me.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.176
I wanted to go into the kitchen
when you went into the kitchen,

00:43.277 --> 00:44.545
but I was like...

00:44.645 --> 00:45.978
Girl, don't come up here
with that bullshit.

00:46.079 --> 00:49.682
I felt very hurt,
because y'all don't give a fuck.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.185
That's not true.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.686
I don't let people in,
and there's a reason for that.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.161
[Tami] This is the true story...

01:01.262 --> 01:02.563
* True story! *

01:02.662 --> 01:04.097
[Jon] Of seven strangers...

01:04.198 --> 01:06.634
[Beth S] Picked to move
back into a house...

01:06.733 --> 01:08.402
[Irene] And have
their lives taped again.

01:08.501 --> 01:09.403
[David] Guess who's back.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.638
Find out what happens...

01:10.737 --> 01:11.971
[Beth A]
When people stop being polite...

01:12.072 --> 01:13.340
[Glen] And start getting real.

01:13.441 --> 01:14.742
[man] Westside!

01:18.346 --> 01:21.781
[light music playing]

01:31.959 --> 01:33.694
-...her feelings.
-Right.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.697
[Irene] Yeah.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.007
[Beth S]
Tami, fuck these cameras.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.643
-I care about your feelings.
-[Tami] It's no problem, Beth.

01:49.742 --> 01:52.746
[Beth S] I'm sorry if you felt
like I was not there for you.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.615
-It's no problem.
-'Cause it really took...

01:54.715 --> 01:56.150
You know, you were so brave.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.319
[Tami] I'm telling you honestly,
don't worry about it.

01:58.418 --> 02:00.853
I'm used to people
not giving a fuck.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.891
[Beth S] I do give a fuck, Tami.

02:03.990 --> 02:06.493
I care very much about Tami,

02:06.593 --> 02:10.698
and the fact that she doesn't
believe me, it hurts.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.865
I just love that you are, like,
opening up,

02:12.966 --> 02:15.468
and I was getting
to know you and...

02:15.568 --> 02:17.704
Okay, well, that's gone, girl.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.673
[chuckles]

02:20.508 --> 02:23.544
[Tami] I wasn't angry,
I was hurt.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.312
The fact that Beth A and Glen

02:25.413 --> 02:27.146
come to talk to me
in the kitchen,

02:27.247 --> 02:28.882
you know, I thought
one of them other bitches

02:28.981 --> 02:30.350
was gonna get up off the couch.

02:30.450 --> 02:34.153
But I found a new level
of respect for Beth A,

02:34.254 --> 02:36.189
because she was the one person
who came over

02:36.289 --> 02:37.324
and said, "I heard you."

02:37.425 --> 02:39.158
We good, girl.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.495
[Beth S] I've tried to take
this opportunity

02:41.594 --> 02:43.563
to get to know everyone,

02:43.663 --> 02:45.699
but as far as I'm concerned,

02:45.799 --> 02:50.471
Tami is not interested in really
having a relationship with me.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.173
And I don't... I don't know
what to do right now.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.376
I don't know...
I don't know what to say.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.711
[groans]

03:13.693 --> 03:16.597
-[Irene] Why are you crying?
-[Beth S] Tami's upset.

03:16.697 --> 03:17.931
She says she doesn't trust me.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.400
I don't think she trusts
anybody right now.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.134
'Cause she doesn't trust us.

03:21.235 --> 03:22.802
Well, let her not trust us.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.837
What, am I...
We're supposed to force her to?

03:24.937 --> 03:26.373
No, I understand that,

03:26.473 --> 03:29.342
but I was really enjoying
to get to know her.

03:29.443 --> 03:30.943
It's still not over.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.414
I know, but she's like...
Her wall's back up again, so...

03:35.848 --> 03:37.317
You know what?

03:37.418 --> 03:38.918
She's just gonna go on
with her life, and I get that.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.353
Tomorrow, she might feel
differently.

03:40.454 --> 03:42.055
I'm not gonna let it hurt
my feelings.

03:42.155 --> 03:44.024
You should not let it hurt
your feelings either.

03:44.123 --> 03:45.959
We're grown-ass women
right now, okay, so...

03:46.058 --> 03:47.860
I know, but I mean,
it's just not true.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.763
I mean, I care about her deeply,

03:49.862 --> 03:51.764
and it took a lot of bravery

03:51.865 --> 03:54.367
to share what she shared
with us.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.736
[sighs]

03:56.836 --> 03:58.004
Beth S just seems like

03:58.104 --> 04:00.240
she wants to be accepted
by everybody.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.075
I think she's just expecting
a little too much.

04:03.175 --> 04:05.445
I would love to know
why she feels

04:05.545 --> 04:08.048
the need to have Tami
like her so much.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.984
Why do you need that so bad?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.819
I mean, there's a lot
of other people in the house

04:12.919 --> 04:14.754
that really love Beth S.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.057
Why is it this one person

04:17.156 --> 04:19.091
she needs to have acceptance
from?

04:19.192 --> 04:21.362
I'm sorry you feel that way,
okay?

04:25.098 --> 04:26.867
[light music playing]

04:26.966 --> 04:28.935
[sighs]

04:36.509 --> 04:42.316
* I am the sun and the Earth *

04:42.415 --> 04:45.552
[Beth A] Right now,
I feel a little exhausted.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.120
Didn't sleep last night.

04:49.088 --> 04:52.225
You can imagine
there's lights on everywhere,

04:52.326 --> 04:57.230
and I got these ridiculous
little eyelash extensions.

04:57.331 --> 04:59.533
It's like having a face mask.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.803
Yeah, I did it to myself.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.204
-How'd you sleep?
-I didn't sleep.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.107
The lights are bright,
so it made me be on.

05:07.206 --> 05:08.576
Yeah.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.411
So then I could hear the rhythm
of Glen's snoring.

05:10.511 --> 05:12.079
[David and Beth A laugh]

05:12.178 --> 05:13.814
[Beth A] It was nice to be done
with the day,

05:13.913 --> 05:15.516
get some rest after all that.

05:15.615 --> 05:17.651
[David] I was so glad yesterday
was over, I was so drained.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.319
[Beth A] I'm sure you were.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.322
What emotional roller coaster
are we gonna ride on today?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.824
[David] I woke up so dehydrated
this morning.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.226
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

05:27.326 --> 05:29.028
[Beth S]
Cheers to a new day, everybody.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.930
So I wake up in the morning,

05:31.031 --> 05:33.199
and I have a lot of anxiety
right now

05:33.300 --> 05:35.334
over how Tami is upset with me.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.204
-Do my eyes look bad?
-Your eyes?

05:38.305 --> 05:40.740
I'm all puffy
from crying yesterday.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.475
-No, they're fine.
-No?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.110
Put a little water on them.
You're fine.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.012
-Okay.
-No, they don't look bad.

05:46.112 --> 05:47.848
But I'm not gonna lose hope
just yet.

05:48.615 --> 05:51.519
I'm gonna keep trying to be
close with her in the house.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.220
Don't let it...

05:53.319 --> 05:54.788
I know, but you know
I'm sensitive.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.255
Yes, but you're letting it.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.191
-No you're right, I did let it.
-Yeah, don't.

05:58.290 --> 06:00.961
'Cause I'm too sensitive.
It's my problem.

06:02.194 --> 06:03.896
[Tami]
Yesterday was a rough one.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.865
Um, but today is a new day.

06:05.966 --> 06:09.970
I think that coexisting
in the house with everybody

06:10.069 --> 06:11.738
is important.

06:11.838 --> 06:14.942
So I'm not trying to talk
about what happened yesterday.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.175
Move on.

06:16.276 --> 06:17.810
We're off of that, right?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.547
Okay, ciao, that's it,

06:19.646 --> 06:22.949
we're gonna see
what today brings

06:23.050 --> 06:26.519
in the L.A. Real World House.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.156
[Glen] Where are you going?
Go ahead, sit there.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.024
I am. I'm sitting.
I just wanted to look

06:32.125 --> 06:34.261
-at the view for half a second.
-Oh.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.896
You know, it's not Hawaii,

06:35.995 --> 06:39.066
but it sure is beautiful
in its own way.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.605
[Jon] Look at us all buddies,

06:44.704 --> 06:46.305
just sitting around
in the beach house.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.875
-I know, this is trippy.
-This is really weird, isn't it?

06:48.975 --> 06:50.543
I'm just kind of
taking it all in.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.613
Tami was very upset
and disappointed with me.

06:53.713 --> 06:55.247
I'm just gonna do whatever I can

06:55.348 --> 06:59.819
to kind of, like, deflate
this thing and, like, move on.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.454
Is Mom bringing some...

07:01.555 --> 07:03.723
[laughter]

07:03.824 --> 07:05.625
Some paper towels, is she?

07:05.725 --> 07:07.528
[Irene] Mom's here
with her paper towels.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.463
Now, you're not gonna be
calling me Mom anymore, right?

07:09.562 --> 07:11.331
[Jon] Tami just told Beth
not to call you Mom,

07:11.430 --> 07:13.165
-and then she called you Mom.
-No, Beth can. Jon can.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.434
[Beth A] That's just weird.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.968
-It is.
-That's just weird.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.771
-[laughs]
-[Jon] Tami just said to not...

07:17.870 --> 07:19.038
I don't like it.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.240
Like, you 80.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.610
[laughs]

07:23.711 --> 07:27.213
I feel like
the blanket-pulling incident,

07:27.314 --> 07:28.882
it needed to be talked about.

07:28.981 --> 07:32.218
That stuff stuck with them,
that stuck with them for life.

07:32.319 --> 07:33.586
Yeah, we didn't know
what it was.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.656
When I saw the drama
that happened before me,

07:36.757 --> 07:39.492
'cause I hadn't watched
those episodes before,

07:39.593 --> 07:42.129
I realized why Glen and I
were so close.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.396
[Tami] They are under the table.

07:44.497 --> 07:45.832
[Jon] They're gonna roll around
under the table,

07:45.932 --> 07:47.466
let them roll around
under the table.

07:47.567 --> 07:49.201
[Beth A] You would think
being some of the few people

07:49.302 --> 07:50.838
that will ever
have this experience

07:50.937 --> 07:52.939
in their whole life,
that we would all be family,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.274
kind of like how
the New York show was.

07:55.975 --> 07:58.211
But they were done
getting to know each other,

07:58.310 --> 07:59.713
they'd already come
to the conclusion

07:59.812 --> 08:01.781
that they didn't have tolerance
for each other.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.983
[Jon] Right as we were
checking out of the resort,

08:04.084 --> 08:05.485
Beth A and Tami
really got into it.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.021
Fucking lighten up.
I'm serious, man.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.591
-I did lighten up.
-So ridiculous.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.358
Let's go back
to high school, Tami.

08:12.459 --> 08:14.627
-Give me a fucking break.
-I know, so why don't you

08:14.728 --> 08:16.463
-stop acting like it?
-Oh, my God.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.699
Stop talking to me, okay?
'Cause I've had enough.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.233
Just stop.

08:20.332 --> 08:22.870
Unfortunately, when the seven
of us get together,

08:22.970 --> 08:24.403
at least one person

08:24.504 --> 08:26.406
has to get into an argument
with somebody else.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.375
We didn't know what the vibe...
where the vibe came from,

08:28.475 --> 08:30.276
and now we know when we came,

08:30.377 --> 08:32.546
why we felt the way we felt,

08:32.645 --> 08:35.081
because that was lingering,
and we had no idea what it was,

08:35.182 --> 08:36.182
because we weren't here.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.085
No wonder Tami was shut down.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.955
Oh, my God,
wait a minute though.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.090
[Jon] The eight ball.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.525
Dominic and I were playing
with this eight ball.

08:47.460 --> 08:51.230
We asked if Jon
was going to get laid.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.265
-Well, ask me.
-You might be offended.

08:53.365 --> 08:54.802
Well, then, don't ask me.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.336
[Jon] We're gonna have
a great experience here

08:56.436 --> 08:58.138
at this homecoming.

08:58.238 --> 08:59.239
Say it out loud.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.807
Outlook not so good.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.309
[laughs]

09:03.409 --> 09:07.114
[Jon] There's the Tami laugh.
There's the Tami laugh.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.716
Let's quit asking this.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.250
Yes, we are gonna have
a great experience.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.754
[Irene] So what have you
been up to, David?

09:13.854 --> 09:15.087
Surviving ICU.

09:15.187 --> 09:17.758
-[laughs]
-[Beth S] What happened?

09:18.859 --> 09:22.162
I was riding my bike
going through, uh, Downtown L.A.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.697
-Okay.
-I'm in the bike path,

09:24.798 --> 09:27.668
and I don't know
where this truck just hits me,

09:27.768 --> 09:28.769
and leaves me there.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.102
So I wake up in ICU.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.705
-They had to...
-Damn.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.306
-...drill a hole in my skull...
-[Beth S] Oh, my God.

09:33.405 --> 09:35.375
...'cause the bone was about
to poke my brain.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.777
-You see all these?
-Oh, no.

09:36.876 --> 09:38.144
[Irene]
That's the scar right there?

09:38.245 --> 09:39.779
[David] Yeah.

09:39.879 --> 09:42.481
[Irene] David has been
struggling through a lot.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.183
He's got this huge dent
in his head.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.986
He told me he had a broken
clavicle, a broken wrist,

09:47.086 --> 09:49.522
I think maybe some broken ribs,

09:49.623 --> 09:53.259
and I was really amazed that
he's able to be with us today.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.961
[David] I used to have dreads,

09:55.062 --> 09:57.730
so I woke up in the ICU
with just, like, three dreads,

09:57.831 --> 09:58.865
'cause they had to...

09:58.966 --> 10:00.332
[chuckles]

10:00.432 --> 10:01.735
You're gonna still do comedy?

10:01.835 --> 10:04.571
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna,
uh, go back on the road,

10:04.672 --> 10:06.840
and living off my savings,
and draining all this,

10:06.940 --> 10:08.741
and the work
ain't coming in, like you...

10:08.841 --> 10:10.576
My God, it was just so...

10:11.510 --> 10:13.145
I'm itching to bounce back

10:13.245 --> 10:15.282
-and make some real money, so...
-Yeah, yeah.

10:15.381 --> 10:16.683
Aw, well, that's great

10:16.783 --> 10:18.618
that you're gonna go back out
on the road.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.153
-That's great.
-Yeah, yeah.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.520
[Irene]
Jon, what have you been up to?

10:21.620 --> 10:22.789
I'm a youth pastor.
I work at a church.

10:22.889 --> 10:24.957
-I lead worship on Sundays.
-Amen.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.426
-[Irene] Mm-hmm.
-[Jon] Love it.

10:26.525 --> 10:27.760
And you've been doing that
for a while, right?

10:27.860 --> 10:29.296
[Jon] 22 years.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.530
I don't know that all
of my roommates know

10:31.630 --> 10:34.167
the extent of my ministry.

10:34.267 --> 10:37.470
Since the show, I actually
returned back to Kentucky

10:37.570 --> 10:39.605
the day the first episode aired.

10:39.706 --> 10:43.076
It was like I was really famous
in the early '90s.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.378
I was doing concerts,
and it was strictly

10:45.477 --> 10:47.647
because they'd seen me
on this reality show.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.548
They hadn't heard
any of my music.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.219
Next Saturday night, I'm gonna
be at the Capitol Music Hall.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.821
Y'all come out and see me,
would you?

10:53.921 --> 10:55.923
After that, I was on the first
Challenge ever.

10:56.889 --> 10:59.525
I was on Battle of the Seasons:
Inferno II.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.193
I was really enjoying life.

11:01.293 --> 11:03.330
I'm gonna bring all of these
people in to have fun with us.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.767
* Some would say I was
A lost man in a lost world *

11:06.866 --> 11:09.469
When my country music career
didn't happen in the '90s,

11:09.568 --> 11:10.870
the attention wore off.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.905
People forgot
that you were this cool,

11:13.005 --> 11:14.474
hip, reality star.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.376
* I lost my faith
In the people on TV *

11:17.476 --> 11:19.245
That was hard to deal with.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.547
You were just a normal dude

11:20.647 --> 11:22.149
that needed to go
get a job again.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.317
And so I immediately went
to work at a church

11:24.417 --> 11:26.986
and became a youth pastor.

11:27.086 --> 11:31.423
* If I ever lose my faith
In you *

11:31.524 --> 11:33.059
These guys,
they're my support group.

11:33.159 --> 11:34.494
When I was young growing up,

11:34.594 --> 11:36.696
I had a lot of mentors
in the church,

11:36.797 --> 11:39.966
and it really laid a foundation
of Christ in my life.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.001
And I'm a mentor
to young people now.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.937
When I was just a little bit
older than you guys,

11:45.038 --> 11:46.505
I was on this television show.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.741
We lived in a house together
with people

11:48.841 --> 11:51.577
that were nothing like me, and
I also was nothing like them.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.447
I have enough young people
to mentor

11:54.547 --> 11:56.582
and to be a father figure
to them.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.485
That's fulfilling my life.

11:58.585 --> 12:01.955
I don't drink alcohol.
I don't live a promiscuous life.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.258
I try not to give in
to the desires of the flesh.

12:05.357 --> 12:08.528
People say, "Aren't you, like,
missing something?"

12:08.628 --> 12:12.164
No, I'm surrounded by people
all the time.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.201
I'm a people person.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.469
I'm pretty happy.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.773
When are you gonna
get married, Jon?

12:20.774 --> 12:21.774
[Jon] I-I'm good.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.143
-[laughter]
-[David] Right.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.411
I mean, uh...

12:24.510 --> 12:25.846
You still a virgin?

12:25.946 --> 12:28.048
-Am I still a virgin? Yes.
-[Tami] You are?

12:28.148 --> 12:29.917
[Jon] Yeah, I'm following
the Lord wholeheartedly.

12:30.017 --> 12:33.153
-I'm all in. I'm all in.
-Oh, my God, that is so good.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.923
I didn't understand it back
when we came through this house

12:36.023 --> 12:37.624
-the first time.
-[Jon] No, you did not.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.860
[Tami] But I can definitely
relate now,

12:39.960 --> 12:41.995
because my oldest daughter,
she's 27,

12:42.095 --> 12:43.730
and she's waiting for marriage

12:43.831 --> 12:47.167
and trying to follow the word
of God with her life too, so...

12:47.267 --> 12:48.969
Does she like country music?

12:49.970 --> 12:51.004
Wouldn't... No.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.940
-No? Oh.
-[laughter]

12:53.039 --> 12:54.640
Sounds like they might have
a lot in common.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.709
-No.
-No? Oh, okay.

12:57.476 --> 12:58.912
So you're waiting for marriage?

12:59.011 --> 13:00.580
[Jon] I'm probably set
in my ways.

13:00.679 --> 13:02.548
I'm probably not getting
married. I'm 47 years old.

13:02.649 --> 13:03.817
Oh, my God,
please don't say that.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.451
You're not even gonna
get married?

13:05.552 --> 13:06.854
-Never say never.
-[Jon] I might, I might.

13:06.953 --> 13:08.587
-You're gonna leave the world...
-I mean, I might.

13:08.687 --> 13:10.557
...and never experience
no coochie?

13:10.657 --> 13:12.359
-Huh? Excuse me?
-[laughter]

13:12.458 --> 13:15.761
You're just gonna go out of
the world with no coochie ever?

13:15.863 --> 13:18.798
Well, yes, not a large priority
at this stage.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.169
It's really tacky to talk
about details of your sex life

13:23.269 --> 13:24.471
on a television show.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.907
It's the same story
28 years later.

13:27.908 --> 13:30.342
After six months in L.A.,
will Jon get laid, then?

13:30.442 --> 13:31.879
[Jon]
That's not a very nice subject.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.881
He just went bright red,
and pissed off

13:34.981 --> 13:36.582
that we're even discussing
his sex life.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.919
[Tami] He was pissed at me
for like a day, I think,

13:40.019 --> 13:42.054
'cause he felt that
we should not be talking

13:42.154 --> 13:43.655
about his-his sexuality.

13:43.755 --> 13:45.959
No, I'm good.
I got other priorities.

13:46.058 --> 13:48.561
There's nobody at the church
that caught your eye, like...?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.063
Well, I live in a small town
right now.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.601
I would like for you to get
some pussy before you die.

13:55.701 --> 13:57.604
You know, if I had my druthers,

13:57.703 --> 13:59.538
I just feel like it's something
that everybody

13:59.639 --> 14:02.875
should just experience
like once at least.

14:04.043 --> 14:05.879
[Irene] Not even being with him
all this years,

14:05.979 --> 14:07.813
I could tell
that kind of language

14:07.914 --> 14:09.481
would make him feel
uncomfortable.

14:09.581 --> 14:10.616
And that's just Jon.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.052
He's a good... I want to say

14:12.152 --> 14:13.753
he's a good boy,
because that's the way

14:13.852 --> 14:15.788
I see him still,
even though he's 47 years old.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.323
I'm gonna keep
my fingers crossed.

14:17.423 --> 14:18.557
[Jon] Keep your fingers crossed.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.192
I think that love
is gonna find you.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.860
I think so too. I think so too.

14:21.961 --> 14:24.563
Can you write a song called
"Love Is Gonna Find Me"?

14:24.663 --> 14:27.299
Oh, okay, I-I think that one...

14:27.399 --> 14:30.169
I don't care what another man
does with his penis.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.706
That is none of my business.
I have a life.

14:37.476 --> 14:38.845
Pouring it on, all the bullshit.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.280
-Just keep on... [mock babbling]
-No, no.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.982
Beth S and I are very close.

14:43.082 --> 14:44.918
We remain close.
We know each other well.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.153
Beth, you know
that I don't like people

14:47.254 --> 14:50.523
trying to dive into my sex life,
especially on television.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.961
[Jon] Too late.
I just don't need all that.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.461
-All of you, just drop it.
-[Beth S] Okay, okay.

14:55.562 --> 14:56.528
-Freaking drop it.
-Okay, okay, okay.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.965
[Jon] God, I didn't need that.

14:58.065 --> 15:00.167
When I say I'm completely
content being single,

15:00.267 --> 15:02.601
that's not then the time
to turn to Tami

15:02.701 --> 15:05.504
and say, "Yeah, Tami, don't you
have a single daughter?"

15:05.605 --> 15:07.206
I think that's time to say,

15:07.307 --> 15:09.542
"Oh, we'll talk about something
else. Jon's clearly upset."

15:09.642 --> 15:11.378
And then she wonders
why people say,

15:11.477 --> 15:12.412
"Beth, you're a drama queen."

15:12.511 --> 15:14.746
[laughing]

15:20.919 --> 15:23.822
[light music playing]

15:23.923 --> 15:25.892
Where's Jon?

15:25.993 --> 15:28.528
Mad at me, probably.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.796
You think?

15:29.895 --> 15:31.298
Mm-hmm.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.932
When I brought up
the word "virgin,"

15:34.033 --> 15:36.503
I instantly saw
Jon's demeanor change,

15:36.602 --> 15:38.404
and I knew
that something was wrong.

15:38.504 --> 15:41.640
This is a person that I spent a
lot of time in a Winnebago with.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.844
So I know when something
upsets him.

15:44.943 --> 15:46.312
He'll get over it, right?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.548
[Beth S]
Yeah, he'll get over it.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.524
What's going on over there?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.960
Jon, you're not your same
jovial self,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.696
so I want to say this.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.265
Upstairs, I made a comment.

16:06.365 --> 16:10.802
It may have appeared
to be insensitive to you,

16:10.903 --> 16:12.504
and that was not the intention.

16:12.605 --> 16:16.875
Because you are so much more
than that piece of your life.

16:16.975 --> 16:19.546
And so I apologize
if I made you feel anything.

16:19.645 --> 16:23.250
No, so after my country music
career did not happen,

16:23.350 --> 16:24.917
I became a pastor.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.586
So I lead worship.

16:26.686 --> 16:29.855
I'm a youth pastor.
I teach sexual abstinence,

16:29.956 --> 16:31.691
because it's in the Bible
that way.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.725
And so when you say,
"Hey, you're kind of old

16:33.826 --> 16:35.961
and you're not married,
tell me about your sex life,"

16:36.062 --> 16:37.596
well, I don't have one.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.432
Married people
don't like single people,

16:39.532 --> 16:40.732
and they don't like single
people to remain single.

16:40.832 --> 16:42.201
-Who said that?
-"Let me fix you up.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.602
Let me fix you up."

16:43.702 --> 16:45.638
When... How many times
have I said that to you?

16:45.738 --> 16:48.441
Didn't you just ask Tami
where her single daughter lives?

16:48.540 --> 16:49.975
Oh, yeah, I did.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.977
-Okay, well, yeah, I... No.
-[Jon] Upstairs, upstairs.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.447
-I did, I did, I did.
-[Jon] Yeah, yeah, you did.

16:54.547 --> 16:57.283
I'm through that. I'm 47 now.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.385
I'm not 37. I'm not 27.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.921
So when you say, "Are you
gonna get any p-word..."

17:02.020 --> 17:04.156
-"P-word." [laughs]
-[Jon] I mean, so... so...

17:04.257 --> 17:06.792
At 47, you're still
saying "p-word." [laughs]

17:06.893 --> 17:10.130
TV Guide called me 30 years ago
"the prudish county singer."

17:10.230 --> 17:11.897
"Prudish country singer."

17:11.998 --> 17:14.134
-So, guys, am I prudish?
-No.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.701
Yeah, take off your shirt!

17:15.801 --> 17:18.938
Strip him naked,
and tie him to a wall.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.507
[whooping]

17:20.606 --> 17:22.674
Don't do it! Oh!

17:22.775 --> 17:25.311
I mean, there were times
where we sat in this very house,

17:25.412 --> 17:27.680
with this very same
group of people,

17:27.779 --> 17:31.017
and did not respect each other
as a child of God.

17:31.117 --> 17:32.551
And had we done that,

17:32.652 --> 17:34.320
we would have had
a whole totally

17:34.421 --> 17:35.721
different respect for one
another, know what I'm saying?

17:35.822 --> 17:37.356
Yeah, but the show
would have been boring.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.290
-The show would've been boring.
-[laughter]

17:38.391 --> 17:41.661
[rock music playing]

17:45.664 --> 17:47.866
Oh, my gosh, this is amazing.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.001
This is so nice.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.238
Whoa!

17:51.337 --> 17:53.339
What are you drinking?
Green tea?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.708
It's green tea,
jasmine green tea.

17:55.807 --> 17:58.677
Okay, I'll bring it up.
Do you want me to carry it?

17:58.778 --> 18:02.949
I got clean and sober at 16,
so I don't drink.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.884
I'm sorry, did I get it on you?
Did I get it on you?

18:05.984 --> 18:08.154
Sometimes I just remove myself,

18:08.255 --> 18:10.823
and right now,
I'm ready to go to bed.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.726
My back hurts,
so I had to come over here.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.694
That feels better. Oh.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.430
-Anyway...
-[Tami] I thought y'all was

18:17.529 --> 18:18.865
cooking up something.
I saw y'all whispering in the...

18:18.964 --> 18:20.567
[Beth S] Who?
Who were y'all talking about?

18:20.666 --> 18:22.134
[Jon] We weren't cooking
anything up.

18:22.234 --> 18:23.336
Oh, no, we're not cooking
anything up.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.804
I was just...

18:25.805 --> 18:26.838
[Beth S] Jon.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.914
[Tami]
So what were you talking about?

18:36.015 --> 18:37.817
[Beth S] We were talking
about some practical jokes

18:37.916 --> 18:39.652
that we're not
gonna share with you.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.019
That's true, Jon?

18:41.119 --> 18:42.355
We're not playing
practical jokes.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.156
We got enough drama
without that.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.726
But you're still not gonna tell
me what you were talking about?

18:46.826 --> 18:51.564
I told Beth that
when I change the subject,

18:51.663 --> 18:53.700
to change the subject with me.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.634
-[Beth S] So yeah, that's...
-Pivot.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.135
[Beth S]
That's what it was, yeah.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.471
[Jon] Pivot.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.173
-Pivot when he pivots.
-[Beth S] Yeah.

19:00.272 --> 19:01.508
-Read the room, and pivot.
-Yeah.

19:01.607 --> 19:03.875
I'm a Baptist Republican.
I can pivot.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.077
[Tami] See, Jon,
that's that shit I don't like.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.747
You know
what that's gonna cause?

19:07.846 --> 19:09.816
That's gonna cause everybody
to just be like,

19:09.915 --> 19:12.219
"Well, I'm just not
gonna say anything."

19:13.118 --> 19:14.287
There's no pivot.

19:14.386 --> 19:16.154
We gonna talk
through this stuff,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.258
and that's what
he didn't want to do.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.159
I thought we were all, like,

19:20.259 --> 19:23.262
all here to really have
conversations.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.464
We all gonna be uncomfortable
in this house.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.067
We're all gonna have moments.
That's why we're here.

19:28.166 --> 19:30.436
So when I open up,

19:30.537 --> 19:34.540
I want to be afforded
that same type of respect.

19:34.641 --> 19:37.576
He's censoring
people's thoughts,

19:37.676 --> 19:41.881
reactions, that will inevitably
create dialogue, right?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.082
[Beth S] Mm-hmm.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.151
Well, then, why are we here?

19:45.251 --> 19:47.586
It's not easy for me to open up.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.888
If you were listening,
I shared some real shit.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.991
[Beth S] I understand
what you're saying. I just...

19:53.092 --> 19:54.961
Jon and I needed to have
a separate discussion

19:55.060 --> 19:57.630
that didn't have anything to do
with you.

19:57.730 --> 20:00.333
-The point of this...
-[Beth S] Yes.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.568
...is when we're all downstairs

20:02.669 --> 20:05.238
-and we're all together...
-Yeah.

20:05.337 --> 20:07.440
...do that shit
in front of all of us.

20:07.539 --> 20:11.844
I think Jon would like to be
a fly on the wall,

20:11.943 --> 20:15.582
where he can watch everybody
else talk about their stuff,

20:15.682 --> 20:18.785
and please don't bring up
anything that pertains to me.

20:18.884 --> 20:22.588
Why does it have to be
a sidebar conversation?

20:22.689 --> 20:24.624
'Cause that's where it feels
like it's shady

20:24.723 --> 20:26.459
and, you know,
like, manipulative.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.928
Do you feel that?

20:30.529 --> 20:32.064
Now, look, she pivoted.

20:32.163 --> 20:33.599
-She pivoted.
-[Irene] She did.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.402
In her mind, she's like,
"Well, how do I answer this?"

20:35.501 --> 20:36.736
Do you see what I'm saying?

20:36.836 --> 20:39.306
I hold everybody accountable.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.839
You go to Beth,

20:40.940 --> 20:44.076
and now you're trying
to encourage her and stifle her,

20:44.175 --> 20:46.479
because you're uncomfortable.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.779
When she's sitting there too,

20:47.880 --> 20:50.048
don't give her no
private-ass conversation.

20:50.148 --> 20:51.617
Put her shit out there too.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.354
Well, we either gonna be real
or we're fucking not.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.587
-[Beth S] Huh?
-[Irene] Yeah.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.088
-[Beth S] What?
-[Irene] Right.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.424
We gonna be real or we not.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.092
[Jon] Well, you guys gotta
understand this.

21:00.192 --> 21:04.364
When I'm done here, I go back
to the people that I mentor,

21:04.463 --> 21:05.865
so I got to really ask myself,

21:05.964 --> 21:08.934
is this conversation one
where a parent's gonna say,

21:09.035 --> 21:10.636
-"You can mentor my kid."
-[Irene] Yeah.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.471
And I... and I respect
what you just said.

21:12.571 --> 21:14.340
I felt like a fish out of water

21:14.441 --> 21:15.942
the whole time I lived here
before.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.477
[Irene] Yeah.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.578
I was feeling that again.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.212
[Tami] That makes sense.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.182
I understand the trial you went
through the first time.

21:23.281 --> 21:25.050
You know why you went
through that the first time?

21:25.151 --> 21:27.653
Because we didn't have
conversations like this.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.821
A lot of people don't have
chances to have do-overs.

21:29.922 --> 21:33.625
Having the chance to have
a mature conversation

21:33.726 --> 21:35.060
and correct our wrongs.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.930
You know, in a lot of ways,
it's a blessing.

21:38.029 --> 21:39.332
I can't believe
we're sitting here

21:39.432 --> 21:40.833
getting to do it again,
honestly,

21:40.932 --> 21:43.869
because I'm never gonna meet
somebody like you, Tami.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.738
I'm never gonna have
this rapport...

21:45.837 --> 21:48.607
-[Tami] You right. You right.
-...with this diverse...

21:48.708 --> 21:51.544
And I think... and we gotta
start telling people that,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.012
you know, you're-you're
an important human being.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.414
To be really honest,

21:55.515 --> 21:57.215
I need to be a little bit
more open to share.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.887
Everybody is getting along,
and I hope it doesn't change,

22:01.988 --> 22:04.757
because these are very unique
relationships.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.826
We're living
such different lives,

22:07.926 --> 22:09.362
that we have so much to learn

22:09.461 --> 22:10.797
and give and share
to one another,

22:10.896 --> 22:12.365
it's-it's kind of ridiculous.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.467
If I don't say anything else
to you guys,

22:14.567 --> 22:16.234
I want you guys to know,
I mean, I-I love you guys,

22:16.335 --> 22:18.438
and this is... this is an
opportunity of a lifetime.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.172
[Tami] You're right.

22:20.271 --> 22:22.642
[Jon] So, I mean, in the state
that our world is in,

22:22.741 --> 22:24.576
we've got to be able to say that
to one another.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.645
You're nothing like me,
but I love you.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.048
I can do that.

22:29.147 --> 22:31.317
I'm really glad
we're opening up,

22:31.417 --> 22:33.051
talking about the past,

22:33.152 --> 22:36.556
and really getting to know
more about each other.

22:36.655 --> 22:37.890
So you know what?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.224
I'm just gonna keep up
with tradition.

22:39.325 --> 22:40.626
Okay, but first,

22:40.727 --> 22:43.695
I'm gonna go turn in
because, um, I'm done.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.665
-[Beth S] I'm tired too.
-[Tami] I'm right behind you.

22:51.804 --> 22:54.807
I'm so thrilled to be back.
Oh, my God.

22:54.906 --> 22:57.544
-This is crazy.
-It's beyond crazy.

22:57.644 --> 22:59.511
This is really...
this is actually...

22:59.612 --> 23:01.847
From waking up in the ICU,

23:01.948 --> 23:04.951
to here, it's just amazing.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.386
That near-death experience,

23:08.488 --> 23:09.788
that was the scariest thing
for me

23:09.888 --> 23:11.490
that I've ever faced in my life.

23:11.590 --> 23:13.291
One minute, I'm in ICU,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.260
and then 'cause I'm doing so
well, they're sending me home.

23:15.361 --> 23:19.798
And after being used to being
pumped full of fucking morphine,

23:19.898 --> 23:22.334
you know, and getting
all that shit out of my body,

23:22.434 --> 23:26.506
I started to feel depressed
and fucking sad.

23:26.605 --> 23:28.140
I was in a tough spot.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.509
So let me ask... let me ask you
a personal question.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.077
If it's too personal, just say,

23:32.177 --> 23:34.580
"Don't ask me that,
none of your business."

23:35.815 --> 23:38.750
Ha-Has alcohol been a struggle
for you in your life?

23:44.557 --> 23:46.858
[coughs]

23:46.959 --> 23:48.193
Excuse me.

23:49.528 --> 23:50.630
[coughs]

23:50.730 --> 23:52.097
Oh. Nicotine.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.333
That one...
that one's a struggle.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.736
[coughing]

23:56.836 --> 23:58.837
-Excuse me.
-You all right, bro?

23:58.938 --> 24:00.807
-Yeah.
-It's all right.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.842
No comment.

24:02.942 --> 24:04.810
Well, I only ask you that,
'cause if it is,

24:04.911 --> 24:07.980
I-I love you, I want to pray
for you, you know?

24:08.079 --> 24:10.348
-No comment...
-But that... Yeah.

24:10.449 --> 24:11.884
[coughs]

24:11.983 --> 24:13.451
...at all.

24:14.586 --> 24:19.959
So i-if you knew that I would
really actually mean it

24:20.058 --> 24:23.663
when I say,
I pray for you every day,

24:23.762 --> 24:26.833
what would you ask me
to pray for you for?

24:29.434 --> 24:31.436
-Can I get back to you on that?
-Please do.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.172
All right, let me think
about that.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.717
[light music playing]

24:47.753 --> 24:50.923
I remember Rollerblading
up and down this alley.

24:51.022 --> 24:52.959
-Yeah?
-Yeah, with Jon.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.425
Well, you know,
it kind of sucks,

24:54.527 --> 24:56.261
'cause I didn't really get
to enjoy the beach,

24:56.362 --> 24:58.297
-because I had to go to work.
-Yeah.

24:58.396 --> 25:01.667
And on the weekends,
I was doing wedding stuff,

25:01.768 --> 25:05.637
so I... I never
got to actually go to the beach.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.406
-Mm-hmm.
-Except for the first day.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.710
-Remember the first day?
-Oh, yeah, the first day. Yeah.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.913
[Irene] When I found out
that we were gonna do all this,

25:15.013 --> 25:17.415
you know, my husband asked me,
"So who is it that you want

25:17.516 --> 25:19.451
to actually get to know better
in the house?"

25:19.551 --> 25:22.253
-Yeah.
-And I said, "Well, everyone,

25:22.354 --> 25:24.455
-but the main one is Tami."
-Mm-hmm.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.858
Because I never had
that relationship with her,

25:26.959 --> 25:30.296
because she just never really
opened up to any of us.

25:30.395 --> 25:32.064
I thought that Tami
was so beautiful

25:32.163 --> 25:33.432
-on the outside.
-Mm-hmm.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.300
But I thought she was ugly
on the inside,

25:35.401 --> 25:38.537
and I judged her, because
I didn't know who she was.

25:38.637 --> 25:41.373
Tami, I haven't even said
five words to her.

25:41.472 --> 25:45.443
She's really moody, and if she's
feeling a certain way,

25:45.544 --> 25:47.046
she'll definitely let you know.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.115
If she's gotta bitch,
she'll say it.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.317
I'm sure, you know, we'll...
we'll eventually

25:51.416 --> 25:53.352
get to know each other
a little... little better.

25:53.451 --> 25:55.622
I'm thinking we're gonna be
best friends when we leave.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.423
-That's what I'm thinking.
-[Irene] Good. I'm glad.

25:57.522 --> 25:58.990
[Beth S]
That's what I'm thinking.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.058
[Irene] I'm glad you do.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.794
* On a cloudy day *

26:01.894 --> 26:04.864
* But your mama always said,
"Look up into the sky *

26:04.963 --> 26:08.200
* Find the sun
On a cloudy day" *

26:08.299 --> 26:11.037
* On a cloudy day *

26:11.136 --> 26:12.503
[coughs]

26:12.605 --> 26:14.073
Name somebody
that has changed drastically.

26:14.173 --> 26:15.473
[Beth A] I feel like
there was a time

26:15.574 --> 26:17.108
when Tami never would have
talked to me,

26:17.209 --> 26:21.247
and I-I think that she's...
she's changed significantly,

26:21.346 --> 26:23.348
and it's fun, it's really fun
to get to see her.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.050
[Jon] Well, I mean,
she's a mom times two.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.352
I'm glad she came,
'cause you know...

26:26.451 --> 26:27.953
-Me too.
-[Jon] It'd be easy to say

26:28.054 --> 26:30.388
she doesn't need this,
she doesn't have time for this.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.423
[Beth A] I mean, she knew
she was walking into the fire,

26:32.523 --> 26:34.160
and she still came.
A lot of respect.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.594
[Jon] Yeah.

26:35.694 --> 26:38.964
This was not easy to walk into
for any of us.

26:39.065 --> 26:40.967
I mean, right?

26:41.067 --> 26:42.634
To me, it's once in a lifetime.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.036
[Jon] Twice.

26:44.135 --> 26:45.403
-Yeah.
-[laughter]

26:45.503 --> 26:47.839
-[Jon] Yeah. Yeah.
-Twice in a lifetime.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.275
-Morning, Tami.
-Hey.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.477
-Look how gorgeous you look.
-Yeah!

26:51.576 --> 26:52.912
-Dang.
-Thank you.

26:53.011 --> 26:54.980
Tami Roman in the house!

26:55.080 --> 26:56.015
She cleans up well.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.650
-Yeah.
-[laughing]

26:57.750 --> 26:59.719
-[computer] Incoming message.
-[Tami] Oh!

26:59.818 --> 27:01.053
Incoming message.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.488
[Tami] Uh-oh.

27:02.587 --> 27:05.590
No matter what this says,
I just love you guys.

27:05.692 --> 27:07.192
[laughter]

27:07.292 --> 27:08.861
Yes, let us know now.

27:10.561 --> 27:12.230
[David]
"From all across the nation,

27:12.330 --> 27:14.733
superfans have submitted
their questions

27:14.834 --> 27:18.636
and hope to get the real dish
on what went on

27:18.738 --> 27:20.807
during the second season
of The Real World."

27:20.906 --> 27:23.041
[Irene] If there's any tension
in the house,

27:23.142 --> 27:27.346
I would love for this to make it
go away for just a few hours.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.448
[David] "Get ready to be
in the hot seat,

27:29.548 --> 27:35.954
because it is time to stop
being polite, just be real."

27:37.455 --> 27:38.790
[Monica] Hi. My name is Monica,

27:38.891 --> 27:40.792
and I have a question
for the group.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.929
So I'm wondering, who was the
most annoying to live with?

27:43.028 --> 27:45.431
I might... might choose myself
on that one.

27:45.530 --> 27:46.932
Who's annoying? Like...

27:47.032 --> 27:48.567
I could answer that question.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.903
The most annoying housemate,
I would say, would be Glen.

27:52.003 --> 27:53.204
I'd say the same about you.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.374
[laughter]

27:55.473 --> 27:57.076
Back in 1993,

27:57.175 --> 28:00.612
who do you all think had the
best overall style in the house?

28:00.712 --> 28:01.948
It's me.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.648
Yeah, but Irene too,
when you look back...

28:03.750 --> 28:05.284
[Tami] That's me. That's me.

28:05.384 --> 28:07.618
Irene had on a uniform
all the time. It's me.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.621
-But I had the mullet.
-[laughter]

28:09.721 --> 28:11.289
[Glen] Man, I forgot
about that one.

28:11.390 --> 28:16.127
My fashion sense in the '90s
was hideous and cringeworthy.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.528
Hi. This is Jon.

28:17.628 --> 28:19.464
Everything was just super bright
and-and horrible.

28:19.565 --> 28:22.134
[Tami] My fashion sense in 1993,

28:22.233 --> 28:24.903
ain't nobody that can tell me
that I wasn't popping.

28:25.003 --> 28:26.505
I had the short cut,

28:26.605 --> 28:29.540
you know, that Toni Braxton,
T-Boz thing going,

28:29.641 --> 28:33.112
and it was red,
my signature color, okay?

28:33.211 --> 28:40.152
My fashion sense in 1993,
I think was a little misguided.

28:40.251 --> 28:41.653
But it wasn't that bad,

28:41.753 --> 28:44.190
because Tami did borrow
my clothes quite often.

28:44.289 --> 28:46.657
[Tami] Wow! Let me see.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.094
This probably fits
around your waist.

28:48.193 --> 28:49.661
Ooh!

28:49.761 --> 28:52.631
Okay, girl, next question.
No, I'm just kidding.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.000
[laughs]

28:55.101 --> 28:56.969
If you had to live
with just one roommate

28:57.068 --> 29:00.506
for the rest of your life,
who would it be and why?

29:00.605 --> 29:02.208
-I would pick Jon.
-You would pick me?

29:02.307 --> 29:03.642
-[David] Yeah.
-I'll take you.

29:03.741 --> 29:05.076
You know, we're kind of
toward the beginning

29:05.176 --> 29:06.678
of our homecoming
experience here,

29:06.778 --> 29:09.147
so if I had to choose somebody
from back in 1993,

29:09.248 --> 29:10.516
it would be Jon.

29:10.615 --> 29:12.351
-Thank you.
-Aw. That's sweet.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.853
Man, this is good so far.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.387
For me, it's a toss-up
between you and Beth,

29:16.488 --> 29:17.556
and let me tell you why.

29:17.655 --> 29:19.025
-Because with you...
-Wow.

29:19.125 --> 29:20.992
...it's just kind of like,

29:21.093 --> 29:22.560
if I don't curse, we'll be good.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.029
Like, you're gonna mind
your business,

29:24.130 --> 29:25.897
and I'm gonna go on
about my business.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.199
With Beth S,

29:27.298 --> 29:29.234
I feel like
there's those opportunities

29:29.335 --> 29:33.505
where we could have actual
fun together and go hang out.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.074
-Wow.
-We could have a couple drinks.

29:35.173 --> 29:36.976
We could do some stuff
and turn up a little bit,

29:37.076 --> 29:39.545
you know, and that's...
I feel like Beth is like

29:39.644 --> 29:41.913
that type of personality.

29:42.013 --> 29:44.083
Beth, why are you crying?

29:47.586 --> 29:49.421
You don't get on my nerves
all the time.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.557
That's what I'm saying.
No, I'm just kidding.

29:51.656 --> 29:52.959
No, I'm just kidding.

29:53.058 --> 29:54.826
Yeah, why did Tami's answer
make you cry?

29:55.794 --> 30:00.266
Because, um, I really wanted
to get to know you

30:00.365 --> 30:02.167
when we lived together,

30:02.268 --> 30:05.872
and I was hurt that I didn't
get to... to meet the real you.

30:05.971 --> 30:08.773
I always had, you know,
a bad feeling about

30:08.875 --> 30:10.608
-the whole thing, and sad.
-Mm-hmm.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.979
And th-that's one of the reasons
why I'm so happy to do this,

30:13.078 --> 30:15.346
'cause I really wanted to...
to get to know...

30:15.446 --> 30:17.048
-to get to know you.
-Mm-hmm.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.018
Even though
it wasn't always positive,

30:19.117 --> 30:22.087
I feel like we had enough
positive experiences.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.821
It was like, yeah,
I mean, we've always...

30:23.923 --> 30:25.656
I'm not the best
fucking roommate.

30:25.757 --> 30:27.659
You know what I'm saying?
So it's like...

30:27.759 --> 30:29.961
-No!
-[Tami] You know, so...

30:30.061 --> 30:31.096
I'm very particular.

30:31.196 --> 30:32.198
That's sweet.

30:32.298 --> 30:34.032
[laughs]

30:36.468 --> 30:38.136
[Tami] Let's talk about choices.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.838
So there's six people
sitting out in front of me,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.741
and I knew definitively who
I wouldn't want to live with.

30:43.842 --> 30:48.447
So out of the three
that were left, I felt Beth S

30:48.547 --> 30:50.082
was the right choice.

30:50.816 --> 30:52.851
Girl, if you don't stop
all that shit.

30:52.951 --> 30:54.586
[laughs]

30:54.685 --> 30:57.823
[lively music playing]

31:02.094 --> 31:03.394
[grunts]

31:03.494 --> 31:04.896
Nice!

31:05.730 --> 31:07.732
-Were you this weird before?
-[Tami] Yes.

31:07.833 --> 31:09.601
[Glen] You guys said it
like every episode.

31:09.701 --> 31:10.936
-Come on.
-I'm like, "Yes."

31:11.037 --> 31:12.471
Every episode.

31:12.570 --> 31:13.905
-Yes, he was.
-[Glen] Yeah.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.875
I have to say,
I was a little disappointed

31:16.976 --> 31:18.777
that you didn't have
your ponytail.

31:18.876 --> 31:20.980
-Like, I'm... I'm, like...
-Do you want me to grow it out?

31:21.079 --> 31:22.580
I do.

31:22.681 --> 31:24.349
-[Greg] It's a lot of work.
-[Tami] I was... I was...

31:24.450 --> 31:25.717
I was looking forward
to the ponytail.

31:25.817 --> 31:26.751
We'll see if we can work
that out.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.019
You think you're gonna grow hair

31:28.119 --> 31:29.788
and put it in a ponytail
before you leave?

31:29.887 --> 31:31.423
No, I'm gonna go in her room
and take one of her...

31:31.522 --> 31:34.792
Oh, you're gonna get my wig?
You're gonna get one of my wigs?

31:34.893 --> 31:38.864
I would like to see you go
in her room and grab her hair.

31:38.964 --> 31:42.000
-Wigs are off-limits.
-You're all gonna die.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.535
Suicide by wig.

31:43.634 --> 31:46.805
With Glen,
I start to feel fakeness.

31:46.904 --> 31:49.307
You do not touch
a Black woman's wig.

31:49.407 --> 31:52.211
I want a rainbow ponytail
so bad.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.113
[Tami] Oh, you can do that one.
I don't care about that one.

31:54.212 --> 31:56.382
-See?
-Yeah, the rainbow one is fine.

31:56.481 --> 31:58.317
[Jon] Don't disrespect
the queen.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.586
-[David] Why you want
a fucking wig on?

32:00.685 --> 32:02.921
It's like, why are you even
saying that, weirdo?

32:03.021 --> 32:06.724
[Tami] My other ones,
those are daily wearing.

32:06.825 --> 32:09.095
Do not touch those.

32:09.194 --> 32:13.832
And that's one of those period
point blanks coming your way.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.201
[laughs]

32:15.300 --> 32:17.603
Tami, I call her queen
of reality television,

32:17.702 --> 32:19.438
we've got to give steel Tami
her props.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.839
So, Glen, shut your ass up,

32:21.940 --> 32:25.111
I will snatch that fucking wig
off your head.

32:27.346 --> 32:30.016
[upbeat music playing]

32:35.320 --> 32:37.655
-We're going bowling?
-I think we need a do-over.

32:37.756 --> 32:38.890
I love a good bowling game.

32:38.990 --> 32:41.160
[Irene] Back in '93,
I loved bowling,

32:41.259 --> 32:44.296
and I thought this would be
a great way to have some fun.

32:44.395 --> 32:47.566
Beth A wasn't there back then,
neither was Glen,

32:47.665 --> 32:49.500
and I thought I'd give David
another chance

32:49.601 --> 32:51.237
to not be left behind.

32:52.003 --> 32:53.204
Shotgun!

32:55.641 --> 32:57.108
It's my day,
you get in the back.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.444
Irene had arranged for us
to go bowling

32:59.545 --> 33:00.846
at 6:00 on a Friday night,

33:00.945 --> 33:02.913
so we said,
"David, we're leaving now."

33:03.015 --> 33:04.415
Well, I said, "Y'all want to go
without me go ahead,"

33:04.516 --> 33:06.018
and I was just playing, I didn't
mean for them to go,

33:06.117 --> 33:06.917
and they left me.

33:07.019 --> 33:08.054
So we took off bowling,

33:08.153 --> 33:09.387
everything was fine then,
I felt.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.655
You know, he knew
we were leaving.

33:10.756 --> 33:11.656
I got mad.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.192
I was waiting [bleep].

33:13.291 --> 33:15.361
I'm telling you, the way
you guys acted was ridiculous.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.196
I'm not a violent person,
but God, I wanted to hit him.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.298
You're a [bleep] embarrassment,
man.

33:20.398 --> 33:22.000
-[bleep].
-Yeah, obviously.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.369
-Obviously, then.
-Piece of [bleep].

33:24.470 --> 33:25.804
Midget.

33:25.903 --> 33:27.405
David, I'm glad we didn't
leave you this time.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.807
[David] I know.

33:28.906 --> 33:29.941
[Jon] You got in the car
on time, here we are.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.843
I'm sorry I called you that.

33:31.942 --> 33:33.545
I'm sorry I called you a midget.

33:38.450 --> 33:39.951
Right down the middle.

33:40.051 --> 33:42.387
I saw it. I was there for it.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.622
[cheering]

33:43.721 --> 33:44.890
[David] I'm not talented
at bowling,

33:44.990 --> 33:46.325
but just to be
with the gang again,

33:46.424 --> 33:48.026
and laughing,

33:48.126 --> 33:51.063
and watching Tami go up to the
thing and scoop with the leg.

33:51.163 --> 33:53.398
I mean it was just hilarious,
and a great time.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.400
You've got it.

33:54.500 --> 33:55.733
[cheering]

33:55.834 --> 33:59.805
I want...
I want Tami on my team!

33:59.904 --> 34:00.806
[Irene] You guys can order
drinks here.

34:00.905 --> 34:02.574
[Beth S] Oh, we can?

34:02.673 --> 34:05.176
-I ordered something, so now...
-Oh, my gosh, I'll take a rosé.

34:05.277 --> 34:07.578
[Irene] Okay,
let me go back to drinks.

34:08.246 --> 34:09.614
Order me a Jack and Coke.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.083
Can you order me
a Jack and Coke?

34:11.182 --> 34:12.518
Come on, baby.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.721
* Cuckoo, cannonball... *

34:15.820 --> 34:17.123
[Jon]
When we were bowling tonight,

34:17.222 --> 34:18.989
we were having a good time,
it felt good.

34:19.090 --> 34:22.161
I actually felt like
I was in my happy place,

34:22.260 --> 34:25.063
and I thought, "You feel right
at home on this reality show,"

34:25.164 --> 34:27.766
because suddenly,
it just seems comfortable.

34:27.865 --> 34:29.335
Just feels normal again.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.336
* *

34:31.436 --> 34:32.971
Bam!

34:33.070 --> 34:36.108
[whooping]

34:36.208 --> 34:39.677
-Thank you, I'm here all week.
-[Irene] Spare, you got a spare.

34:39.777 --> 34:42.681
I got to see David
actually bowl.

34:42.780 --> 34:44.349
You call that bowling?

34:44.449 --> 34:47.686
-So I get to go home a champ?
-I beat your ass in that.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.954
[laughing]

34:50.054 --> 34:52.490
Hey, y'all want to do
a joint confessional?

34:52.590 --> 34:54.059
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.027
-We're the best.
-West side.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.128
[laughter]

34:57.228 --> 34:59.030
-Hollywood, baby.
-That's it.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.333
-This is what I want to say.
-Get it off your chest, babe.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.402
East side, take a look
at the west side,

35:04.503 --> 35:07.072
-take a look at the west coast.
-West side!

35:07.172 --> 35:10.509
What about all you poor
fucking other casts?

35:10.608 --> 35:12.710
Julie, you think
you're all that?

35:12.811 --> 35:16.715
Fuck you.
At least we got the best city.

35:16.815 --> 35:19.117
And nobody's got COVID.

35:19.217 --> 35:23.722
-[whooping]
-West side!

35:23.822 --> 35:25.224
But New York, we love you.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.992
Yeah, I mean, the truth is,
we love you guys really.

35:28.092 --> 35:30.561
But it's still west side.

35:30.661 --> 35:32.297
[whoops]

35:33.164 --> 35:34.900
Beth just went crazy
for a minute.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.704
Don't mess with Beth, okay?

35:39.304 --> 35:41.873
It's 8:00.
We're done with clips?

35:41.972 --> 35:43.474
We got off easy today.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.311
Did anybody order the Pacifica?

35:45.411 --> 35:47.278
You probably did then,
they probably asked you.

35:47.378 --> 35:49.114
I don't think so,
I don't remember doing that.

35:49.215 --> 35:52.351
Did Beth get excited
and slap your shoulder?

35:52.451 --> 35:57.255
We've got David Edwards,
comedian extraordinaire.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.190
-Beth was on fire, man.
-But she slapped you, right?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.327
Yeah, she did that,
she amped that shit up.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.728
-Is this the injured one though?
-No, no, no.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.697
-This one is. Where she hit?
-Yeah.

36:05.797 --> 36:07.097
And that hurt like
a dickens, didn't it?

36:07.199 --> 36:09.867
-No, no, not at all, not at all.
-Okay. All right.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.869
Not at all.

36:16.675 --> 36:19.411
[Irene] David filled up
his water bottle with this.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.646
-What is it, tequila?
-[Irene] Gin.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.315
Oh, my...

36:24.081 --> 36:25.851
[David] Women lie, men lie.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.219
Numbers don't.

36:27.318 --> 36:31.088
[laughs]

36:35.994 --> 36:39.164
Y'all my family,
whether y'all like it or not.

36:39.264 --> 36:43.302
-Even me?
-Even you, baldy.

36:44.001 --> 36:46.103
[Beth A] Dinner's here.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.206
I love these people so much.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.076
[Beth A] I'm not sure
what he's drinking,

36:51.175 --> 36:54.579
but I see a dramatic change
in David's behavior.

36:54.679 --> 36:57.081
I've had 34 years in recovery,

36:57.181 --> 37:00.452
and so I feel a little bit
concerned about David's choices,

37:00.552 --> 37:02.987
and I think it kind of
went south pretty quick.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.190
When I watched the homecoming,
the New York one,

37:06.291 --> 37:08.760
that is the one thing
that bothered me,

37:08.860 --> 37:10.862
when Julie went off.
I'm like, "What is this?

37:10.961 --> 37:12.931
Like, this has always
been a competition?

37:13.030 --> 37:14.632
Like, some type of competition?"

37:14.733 --> 37:17.034
Okay, well apparently it is,
and we got our shit off though,

37:17.135 --> 37:20.170
we did our shit proper though,
holla, holla, holla.

37:20.271 --> 37:23.442
I couldn't believe Julie,
Julie was like,

37:23.541 --> 37:25.911
"F every other cast,"
I'm like, "Really?"

37:26.010 --> 37:29.914
The fact that the trans
Black Lives Matter march

37:30.014 --> 37:32.284
went right by their flat,

37:33.117 --> 37:34.385
after all of the content

37:34.485 --> 37:36.355
that they were doing
in that direction,

37:36.454 --> 37:38.690
I was like, "How the hell
are we gonna come up

37:38.789 --> 37:41.192
-with something like that?"
-I don't know, I don't know.

37:41.293 --> 37:43.795
Well, that's why Tami
brought the wig.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.132
What the fuck?

37:48.599 --> 37:50.568
What the fuck?

37:51.836 --> 37:53.271
I'm a one-man parade.

37:53.371 --> 37:56.807
Yeah, you can get
the green apple, bitch.

37:58.677 --> 38:00.378
Don't disrespect the queen, ho.

38:00.478 --> 38:03.949
Wait, wait, he thinks I just
said something bad about you.

38:04.048 --> 38:05.516
-That what?
-No.

38:05.617 --> 38:06.918
They didn't attack us by name.
I think, did he?

38:07.018 --> 38:09.054
Oh, no, this is not good.

38:09.153 --> 38:12.423
But at the same time,
I don't want to escalate things,

38:12.523 --> 38:14.793
so I decide to walk away.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.795
Whose phone is that?

38:16.894 --> 38:18.496
That's mine...
Oh, that's Dave's, right?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.831
Okay, I just don't want you
to forget it.

38:20.931 --> 38:22.601
A-And, my name is not Dave,
it's David.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.869
Well, you used to call Dom
Dominique all the time.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.804
I don't care, my name is David.

38:26.905 --> 38:29.440
If you want to be called David
just let us know, thank you.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.876
I'll call you David.

38:30.976 --> 38:33.244
[David] Thank you, king.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.045
-He's going there.
-What?

38:35.146 --> 38:36.181
-He's going there.
-Who's going there?

38:36.280 --> 38:38.784
-Dave... id.
-What?

38:38.884 --> 38:41.219
-David.
-Oh, oh, what's wrong?

38:41.318 --> 38:42.653
He threw a fucking apple at me.

38:42.753 --> 38:43.688
[Beth S] Wait a minute.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.123
[Glen] I ain't fucking doing it.

38:45.222 --> 38:47.324
I'm not doing it,
I'm not doing it.

38:48.226 --> 38:50.061
I'm just like,
"What the fuck, man?"

38:50.161 --> 38:51.295
[Jon] I'm worried about him,

38:51.396 --> 38:53.097
he's got some dependency
problems, y'all.

38:53.197 --> 38:55.266
David, he's hot and cold,

38:55.367 --> 38:58.804
and it's moments apart,
so it's not like a mood swing,

38:58.903 --> 39:02.139
but it's just...
He's unpredictable.

39:02.239 --> 39:03.509
Hey.

39:03.608 --> 39:05.043
That's why you've got
to follow your spirit.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.577
That's where you know
where people are at,

39:06.677 --> 39:08.780
you've got to follow that signal
that's in your heart.

39:08.880 --> 39:12.550
Spirit and soul, hey, family.
What you doing, bro?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.530
Y'all look like you was having
a meeting or something

39:24.630 --> 39:25.563
before I came up here.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.498
Dave, you know, if-if, um...

39:27.599 --> 39:30.601
-[David] My name is not Dave.
-Yeah, that's right, Dominique.

39:31.469 --> 39:34.873
[David] And it's really not,
legally or street-wise,

39:34.972 --> 39:36.206
my name is not Dave.

39:36.306 --> 39:37.307
[Glen] Dave, do you remember

39:37.409 --> 39:38.610
throwing something at me
tonight?

39:38.710 --> 39:41.813
Dave's a whole 'nother
motherfucker.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.213
[Jon]
I'm sitting there thinking,

39:43.313 --> 39:46.818
"Glen, hush, man.
Like, shut it for a minute."

39:46.918 --> 39:49.454
[Jon] David was extremely drunk.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.722
Now's a good time
to leave him alone.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.025
And, uh, I'm concerned for him.

39:55.460 --> 39:57.128
You know,
you're my replacement, right?

39:58.697 --> 40:01.800
[chuckles]

40:01.900 --> 40:03.601
What is happening right now?

40:03.702 --> 40:06.371
[David] No matter what,
you'll always be behind me.

40:06.472 --> 40:08.306
[laughs]

40:09.039 --> 40:11.342
Hey, hey, just...

40:12.077 --> 40:14.112
I know, hey.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.721
We're not gonna reason
with him right now.

40:23.889 --> 40:27.391
We were all getting along
really famously for two hours,

40:27.492 --> 40:29.427
and it was too good to be true.

40:29.527 --> 40:32.063
There may be a point of clarity
tomorrow,

40:32.163 --> 40:33.632
where we can say,
"Hey, dude, we're concerned."

40:35.666 --> 40:37.536
It's sad to see somebody
self de...

40:37.635 --> 40:39.137
[Beth S] What can we do
to help him?

40:39.237 --> 40:40.739
[Jon] Well, nothing
right at this moment.

40:40.838 --> 40:43.608
He's 50 years old, he's gonna
make his own decisions.

40:43.708 --> 40:47.344
But it's sad to watch
somebody self-destruct.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.280
I don't want to see him
self-destruct.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.583
So are we gonna turn this
into an intervention for David?

40:51.682 --> 40:53.918
Is this gonna become
an intervention?

40:54.385 --> 40:56.688
[Beth S] Would you feel okay
just, like, sitting back?

40:56.788 --> 40:58.789
It, like, it breaks my heart.

40:58.889 --> 41:01.159
He's... self-destructing.

41:07.398 --> 41:08.833
* *

41:08.934 --> 41:11.068
[Jon] He's self-destructing.

41:11.737 --> 41:16.007
I know that he has
the power within himself.

41:16.106 --> 41:17.976
We can't gang up
on him six on one.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.710
I would feel terrible about it.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.079
[Glen]
Maybe we should sleep on it,

41:21.179 --> 41:22.347
and maybe we'll come up
with something.

41:22.447 --> 41:24.382
Hey, Beth. You okay?

41:24.481 --> 41:26.885
No, did you see me get hit
tonight at the table?

41:26.985 --> 41:29.186
-He hit you?
-[Glen] Yeah!

41:29.286 --> 41:31.356
When I was joking
with Tami about the wigs,

41:31.456 --> 41:34.793
he got up and threw, like,
a pear or something at me.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.896
[Beth A] Glen is frustrated
with David,

41:37.996 --> 41:40.699
but I think that
he needs to just

41:40.798 --> 41:43.168
kind of chill out for a second.

41:43.268 --> 41:46.237
He has come off a hard ride,
and this is a lot,

41:46.336 --> 41:48.373
and it's a lot of emotion
in a short period of time.

41:48.472 --> 41:52.376
He's clearly been waiting
for 30 years for this moment,

41:52.476 --> 41:56.347
to be back in Tami's good
graces, it means a lot to him.

41:56.447 --> 42:00.184
Well, frankly,
the unpredictable behavior

42:00.284 --> 42:03.889
is what caused problems
back in the day.

42:04.655 --> 42:07.157
[sighs]

42:07.257 --> 42:11.028
[Jon] David's a mess, y'all.
David's volatile, he's a mess.

42:13.831 --> 42:15.833
[Glen] I mean,
what's gonna help him?

42:15.934 --> 42:18.536
We're with him
for the rest of this.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.806
[Jon] He's really drunk,

42:20.905 --> 42:23.608
so it's not an enjoyable David
that we're experiencing.

42:23.708 --> 42:27.478
And I'm having
a lot of concern about...

42:27.579 --> 42:30.547
substances that he's battling.

42:30.648 --> 42:32.083
He's gonna have to sleep
this off tonight.

42:32.182 --> 42:33.451
Why don't we make sure that

42:33.550 --> 42:35.452
we just don't have alcohol...

42:35.552 --> 42:36.788
-...available?
-In the house.

42:36.887 --> 42:38.056
-Yeah.
-[Glen] Yeah, I...

42:38.155 --> 42:39.625
Yeah, I would be willing
for that, too.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.327
-Let's box it up now.
-[Beth S] Okay.

42:43.494 --> 42:44.862
[Jon] This is a bad night,

42:44.963 --> 42:46.396
but I want David to be able
to redeem himself,

42:46.496 --> 42:49.034
and this was our chance
to support him.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.400
[Beth S] Let's just
get rid of it.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.838
[Jon] Here. That one, right?

42:54.739 --> 42:56.742
[Beth S] Oh, I don't...

42:56.842 --> 42:59.010
Oh, my God.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.045
Out back.

43:05.215 --> 43:07.351
[Beth S] Yeah.

-[Jon] Oh, my.
-[Tami] Oh, now, this is nice.

43:27.204 --> 43:29.340
I can actually get through
this trip now.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.541
[Irene] I didn't want
another divorce,

43:31.643 --> 43:33.811
but I did it because I didn't
want my kids to grow up

43:33.911 --> 43:35.512
in a house with no love.

43:35.612 --> 43:37.447
[Jon] Irene,
I've never seen you happier

43:37.547 --> 43:39.184
than you have been with Phil.

43:39.284 --> 43:43.253
And the best part of it all
is that my kids love him.

43:43.353 --> 43:44.521
Well, this is very exciting.

43:44.621 --> 43:47.557
I love you with everything
I have.

43:48.525 --> 43:49.427
Aw.

43:49.527 --> 43:50.661
David, do you mind just not

43:50.762 --> 43:52.597
smoking weed at the table?

43:52.697 --> 43:54.666
I don't know
what her fucking problem is.

43:54.766 --> 43:56.934
What is it with her? What is it
with her that you're...

43:57.034 --> 43:58.635
I don't trust the bitch.

43:58.737 --> 44:00.838
-When I left my guard down.
-Let your guard down with what?

44:00.938 --> 44:03.141
-Against all the women...
-'Cause I asked you not to vape,

44:03.240 --> 44:04.409
and you blew smoke in my face.

44:04.509 --> 44:05.844
When you're willing
to let me talk

44:05.943 --> 44:07.778
and stop fucking cutting me off,
I shall return.
