00:22.600 --> 00:25.967
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression,

00:26.037 --> 00:30.599
'Everything happens for a reason'?
Well, I don't think that applies to me.

00:31.343 --> 00:33.402
I mean, I spend every morning
rushing to work

00:33.478 --> 00:37.346
trying to catch the same subway
to the same lousy job.

00:37.415 --> 00:38.746
What's the reason for that?

00:38.817 --> 00:43.254
See, I'm a researcher for one of the
biggest publishing houses in Chicago,

00:43.321 --> 00:45.312
but where I really belong is in Creative.

00:45.423 --> 00:49.951
The problem is, is my boss doesn't
know it yet, so I'm totally frustrated.

00:50.028 --> 00:51.996
While my friend Paul keeps telling me,

00:52.063 --> 00:55.260
'You gotta be optimistic.
You gotta be positive. '

00:55.333 --> 00:56.891
OK. OK. You know what?

00:56.968 --> 01:00.369
Today is gonna be my lucky day.
Today is gonna be my...

01:03.742 --> 01:06.711
Hey, look at that. It's your lucky day.
- Did you just see that?

01:06.778 --> 01:07.767
Oh, I've seen it a million times.

01:07.846 --> 01:09.211
You want it?
- No.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.908
I don't want it. Go ahead.
You got a new briefcase.

01:11.983 --> 01:13.951
Yeah, maybe its got a name
on it or something.

01:14.019 --> 01:16.385
Oh, come... What are you, nuts?
- What?

01:16.454 --> 01:17.978
You're gonna return it?
- Yeah.

01:18.089 --> 01:20.284
Did you not just say
you needed a new one?

01:20.358 --> 01:21.757
Yeah, when I get my raise.

01:21.826 --> 01:23.794
Haven't you been working
there for, like, a year?

01:23.895 --> 01:26.295
I bet Taylor doesn't even know
you work there. I'd be pissed.

01:26.364 --> 01:30.528
Are you pissed? I'd be pissed.
- Yeah, I'm-I'm a little pissed.

01:30.602 --> 01:33.901
You know, come to think of it,
I've never really seen you angry before.

01:33.972 --> 01:35.530
Henderson, you ever
seen Tom really angry?

01:35.607 --> 01:38.269
No.
- All right, fine. So I don't get angry.

01:38.343 --> 01:40.038
What is that, a bad thing?

01:40.111 --> 01:43.672
It's, you know, you keep it bottled up
and then sooner or later,

01:43.748 --> 01:46.808
you come into work and you mow
everyone down with one of those...

01:46.918 --> 01:50.081
AK-47.
- AK-47. You know, just to impress, uh...

01:50.188 --> 01:51.951
Jodie Foster.
- Jodie Foster.

01:52.023 --> 01:55.254
All right. I'll do it
on your day off, all right?

01:55.326 --> 01:59.922
TouchÃ©. There she is.
It's your Jodie Foster.

01:59.998 --> 02:00.987
Paul, come on, man.

02:01.066 --> 02:02.363
How you ever gonna get
to know her if you just sit there?

02:02.434 --> 02:04.402
It's Taylor's daughter, man. I can't just...

02:04.469 --> 02:08.906
You can't just what? Huh? Are you
gonna be a loser your whole life? Hmm?

02:08.973 --> 02:12.340
Just go over there
and talk to her. Go. Go.

02:12.410 --> 02:15.243
OK, fine. I'm going. I'm going.
- You're going.

02:32.831 --> 02:34.298
Excuse me.

02:45.310 --> 02:47.005
Hi. I'm...

02:51.983 --> 02:53.780
I... Oh!

02:54.886 --> 02:57.855
Uh... I... He wa...

03:07.899 --> 03:10.367
What are you doing to my dog?
- Ma'am...

03:10.435 --> 03:13.268
Who's taunting my dog?
- No one's taunting your dog. He...

03:15.173 --> 03:17.232
Um, the-the d... Um...

03:18.143 --> 03:21.340
Here, why don't you take my seat? Here.

03:23.915 --> 03:25.473
Great. Now, that's great.

03:25.550 --> 03:27.142
Two more minutes, and I'm gonna
be closer than you are.

03:27.252 --> 03:28.810
Look. Opening. Go.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.888
Just go.

03:30.989 --> 03:33.253
Go. Go.

03:34.592 --> 03:36.082
It's OK. Go, just go.

03:39.264 --> 03:43.166
Lake Street.
Lake Street is next.

03:45.370 --> 03:48.464
You're Tom Stansfield, right?
From Research?

03:48.540 --> 03:52.499
Yeah. Yeah. Tom. Tom Stansfield.

03:57.315 --> 04:00.682
Stansfield from Research.

04:03.821 --> 04:05.288
It's a growing sport, you know?

04:05.390 --> 04:07.858
Paul, there is no way that she thought
that it was a wrestling magazine.

04:07.959 --> 04:10.450
Oh, come on. Get over it, OK?

04:10.562 --> 04:12.792
You're a little embarrassed.
It happens, OK?

04:12.864 --> 04:14.491
Let me tell you something.
If I had a dime for every time

04:14.566 --> 04:16.397
a gay naked magazine fell out of my...
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

04:16.466 --> 04:17.456
What? Paul!

04:17.535 --> 04:19.264
No. But seriously,
so you're a little humiliated.

04:19.337 --> 04:22.363
At least now we've established
that she knows who you are, right?

04:22.440 --> 04:24.408
I'm gonna have to leave the company.
- No, you're not.

04:24.475 --> 04:25.806
Oh, God. There she is.

04:25.877 --> 04:27.936
Oh, and I need to see the proofs
on Thailand immediately.

04:28.012 --> 04:30.105
All right. What else have we got?

04:35.620 --> 04:38.555
Are you Tom?
- Yes.

04:38.623 --> 04:42.719
Mr. Taylor wants to see you.
- Oh... OK.

04:43.361 --> 04:44.328
OK.

04:44.429 --> 04:47.956
OK, you see? This is your chance. This
is fate. This is what I'm talking about.

04:48.032 --> 04:51.058
It's about that new opening in Creative
and you're the man for the job.

04:51.135 --> 04:53.467
You're gonna go in there and you're
gonna pitch him those book ideas.

04:53.538 --> 04:55.369
No, I just... I'm really not ready.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.670
Let's get to business.
Now we're steppin' up. OK.

04:57.742 --> 04:59.437
Come on. You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna pitch him an inside curve...

04:59.510 --> 05:00.875
Wait, wait. Where is my blue folder?

05:00.945 --> 05:03.175
You don't need it. Enough with
the excuses already. Come here.

05:03.248 --> 05:05.773
You look good. You feel good?
- I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

05:05.850 --> 05:07.647
Well, that's good.
I want you to use that, OK?

05:07.752 --> 05:09.811
What is this? This dad's?
It's nice. Now get in there, OK?

05:09.921 --> 05:12.719
Don't-don't touch my ass.
- What? It was a light spank. It was light.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.220
Hey.
- Hey.

05:17.295 --> 05:19.889
Uh, do I just go in there?
- Um, no. He's not finished yet,

05:19.964 --> 05:22.296
but you can have a seat over there.
- Oh, OK.

05:22.367 --> 05:24.995
Let me explain something
to you, Henderson.

05:25.069 --> 05:30.371
I did not dislike your ideas.
I found them loathsome.

05:32.277 --> 05:34.905
I hated them.

05:34.979 --> 05:37.539
You're dismissed.
- From your office?

05:37.615 --> 05:39.674
Nice try.

05:43.021 --> 05:46.513
Good luck. You're gonna need it...
- He's ready to see you.

05:46.624 --> 05:47.955
You can come in.

05:48.026 --> 05:50.893
You know what? We should have
never let up after the Revolution!

05:50.962 --> 05:53.396
Sit down. Sit down. Coffee?

05:53.464 --> 05:57.560
We shouldn't have left you at toehold.
We should have driven you to the sea!

05:59.937 --> 06:03.839
Now... what's this I hear
about you making threats

06:03.908 --> 06:07.002
to spray this place with an AK-47?

06:07.078 --> 06:09.069
What?

06:10.081 --> 06:15.246
Oh, oh, oh. No. That...
I was just making a joke.

06:15.353 --> 06:18.413
Oh, that's funny to you?
Killing everyone in this office?

06:18.523 --> 06:25.258
No. No. No, no, no, no. The...
Paul said how I never get angry...

06:25.330 --> 06:27.821
And what about you
making fun of midgets?

06:27.899 --> 06:29.594
I never made fun of midgets.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.999
You said it'd be fun to date one

06:32.070 --> 06:34.129
because then you could rest
your beer on her head.

06:34.205 --> 06:36.400
No. No, I never said anything like that.

06:36.474 --> 06:39.307
Apparently Henderson thinks you did.

06:39.377 --> 06:42.676
Now I've got a good sense of humor,
but that's just plain sick.

06:42.747 --> 06:45.545
But, sir, I didn't say...
- Audrey?

06:46.818 --> 06:49.378
Which file did I ask you for?
- Uh, the Platt file?

06:49.487 --> 06:52.888
John Platt. Not Sam Platt.
- I'm sorry. I guess I didn't think that...

06:52.957 --> 06:54.720
That's right. You didn't think.

06:54.792 --> 06:57.852
Now if it's not too much trouble,
if you could fetch me the right file...

06:57.929 --> 07:00.124
OK.
- And get Tom and me some doughnuts.

07:01.666 --> 07:06.330
Now... I'm told you've been trying
to schedule a meeting with me

07:06.404 --> 07:09.896
about some ideas. What are they?

07:09.974 --> 07:14.877
Oh, uh... yeah. I had-I had some ideas.

07:16.881 --> 07:20.146
Something wrong with the coffee?
- Uh, no. It's fine.

07:20.251 --> 07:22.719
Why'd you make a face?
- What?

07:22.820 --> 07:26.085
Oh, well... It's-it's a little bitter, but...

07:29.293 --> 07:32.490
Jesus. Audrey, get in here!
- Sir, really, it's f... It's not a problem.

07:32.563 --> 07:35.293
I've burped up stuff better than this.
- Sir, it's fine.

07:35.366 --> 07:38.426
Is something wrong?
- Taste Tom's coffee.

07:38.503 --> 07:40.869
No, really. It's OK.

07:42.573 --> 07:46.168
How would you rate that?
- Well, it's not that great.

07:46.244 --> 07:51.978
Not that great? I guess so.
Tom thinks it's shit.

07:52.049 --> 07:55.177
Audrey, are you retarded?

07:55.286 --> 07:58.517
It's not a rhetorical question.
Are you retarded?

07:58.623 --> 07:59.590
No, I'm not retarded.

07:59.690 --> 08:04.150
Because a retarded person can make
a cup of coffee. Am I right, Tom?

08:04.228 --> 08:06.560
Oh, I... I don't-I don't really know much

08:06.631 --> 08:09.191
about the limitations
of the handicapped.

08:09.267 --> 08:14.569
I know of an employment agency that
hires out retarded people for $4 an hour.

08:14.639 --> 08:19.201
So, if making a cup of coffee is too
difficult a task for you, Miss Bennett,

08:19.277 --> 08:22.337
perhaps you'd be good enough to let
me know, and I'll contact this agency

08:22.413 --> 08:25.974
and give a retarded person a job.

08:31.422 --> 08:35.620
I wasn't too rough on her, was I?
- Well, she is new and all.

08:35.693 --> 08:38.991
Maybe I was out of line. But do you
understand what I'm dealing with?

08:39.063 --> 08:42.760
I mean, here I am trying
to fill a position in Creative,

08:42.833 --> 08:47.567
and I can't seem to find one person
responsible enough to earn my trust.

08:47.638 --> 08:51.005
I sometimes wonder if anyone here
even knows what they're doing.

08:51.075 --> 08:52.838
I can understand how you
could see it that way, sir, but...

08:52.910 --> 08:55.708
So you don't think I was out of line?

08:57.482 --> 09:01.680
Well, if what you're saying
is that a company

09:01.786 --> 09:04.721
is only as strong as its weakest link,
that makes sense, but...

09:04.789 --> 09:07.053
Exactly. That's exactly right.

09:07.124 --> 09:09.524
A company is only as strong
as its weakest link.

09:09.594 --> 09:11.528
Yeah...
- Audrey, get in here!

09:11.596 --> 09:13.564
You were right, Tom.
I was too soft on her.

09:13.631 --> 09:14.791
What? No.
- Yeah?

09:14.866 --> 09:16.800
Audrey, after talking it over
with Tom here,

09:16.868 --> 09:19.894
I've come to realize that
I'm gonna have to let you go.

09:19.971 --> 09:22.769
You're firing me?!
- I'm sorry. It's just not working out.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.774
But, sir, I was suggesting...
- I take my job very seriously.

09:24.842 --> 09:27.037
A chain is only as strong
as its weakest link.

09:27.111 --> 09:30.239
Right, but there's a whole other side.
- Thanks for the support.

09:30.314 --> 09:32.509
Audrey, empty out your desk
by the end of the day.

09:32.583 --> 09:34.608
Fine.
- Sir, this... I...

09:34.719 --> 09:36.346
Thanks for straightening me
out there, Tom.

09:36.454 --> 09:38.854
Right, right. But I didn't get to say
what I wanted to say.

09:38.923 --> 09:43.587
Oh, your ideas, of course. Schedule
an appointment with my new secretary.

09:50.701 --> 09:53.898
Tom. Are you OK?

09:53.971 --> 09:56.838
Uh... yeah, sure.

09:56.908 --> 09:58.842
I'm guessing by the way
you look he's on another one

09:58.910 --> 10:00.207
of his rampages this morning.

10:00.278 --> 10:02.542
Definitely.
- Damn.

10:02.613 --> 10:04.046
I was hoping to catch him
in a good mood.

10:04.115 --> 10:08.245
Yeah, that's, um...
that's probably not gonna happen.

10:08.352 --> 10:10.946
I'm supposed to go to this party tonight,
but my dad's making me housesit

10:11.055 --> 10:13.114
for his stupid bird while
he's away this weekend.

10:13.224 --> 10:15.784
Well, why don't you go in there
and tell him you're not gonna do it?

10:15.893 --> 10:17.656
I can't just...

10:17.728 --> 10:20.891
You can't just what? I mean, live your
own life and have a free weekend?

10:20.965 --> 10:23.900
No, it's not that.

10:25.303 --> 10:27.863
Wait, it is that.
- Yeah.

10:27.939 --> 10:31.568
I should just go to that party.
- Yeah, of course.

10:32.343 --> 10:37.246
Well, um... OK, I'm gonna
go back to, uh, work.

10:37.315 --> 10:39.476
OK, sure.

10:39.550 --> 10:43.213
Tom? I know this might seem
a little out of place

10:43.321 --> 10:45.255
because we barely
even know each other.

10:45.323 --> 10:47.951
But, do you have any plans tonight?

10:49.427 --> 10:50.621
No, no, no.

10:50.695 --> 10:55.132
Uh... no. I'm-I'm wide open.
- We won't be home too late.

10:55.199 --> 10:56.427
Hey, it's no problem.

10:56.500 --> 10:59.628
So the party starts at 7.
You could be at my dad's house by 6?

10:59.704 --> 11:01.331
Sure.
- You sure you're cool with this?

11:01.405 --> 11:04.568
Are you kidding me?
- Tom, you're such a sweetheart.

11:04.642 --> 11:08.510
Thank you so much.
I'm gonna love you forever for this.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.446
All right. Yeah, who's the man now?
- See? What'd I tell you?

11:13.517 --> 11:17.317
I'm a lady-killer.

11:21.192 --> 11:23.820
How the hell could he be
so excited about housesitting?

11:23.894 --> 11:28.126
He's nice, Daddy. That's how.
Most guys wouldn't even offer to do that.

11:28.199 --> 11:30.690
I don't know if I want him
around my bird.

11:30.768 --> 11:34.829
Oh, Dad, will you just relax?
It's gonna be fine. I promise, OK?

11:34.905 --> 11:38.671
I'll check in as soon as I get there. 8:00.

11:39.276 --> 11:42.074
If I sense anything's wrong,
you're coming back here.

11:42.146 --> 11:44.137
OK. OK.

12:31.762 --> 12:33.957
Very good. Right on time.

12:34.031 --> 12:38.934
Oh, sir. Uh... Hey, is that a bear trap?

12:39.003 --> 12:43.303
Yes. It's to keep the neighbor's kids
out of my yard.

12:50.314 --> 12:55.308
Sir, I just wanted to let you know
how much I appreciate you...

12:55.419 --> 12:58.013
well... letting tonight happen.

12:58.122 --> 13:03.719
I mean, I know it means a lot to Lisa,
and I think you're doing the right thing.

13:04.495 --> 13:06.258
I don't know what
you're planning, Stansfield,

13:06.330 --> 13:09.891
but you're attitude
is making me very nervous.

13:11.635 --> 13:15.071
Those socks are clean, right?
- Um...

13:15.139 --> 13:20.167
You hesitated. Put those on.
- Are you serious?

13:30.121 --> 13:33.056
If you want to watch TV,
the remote's there.

13:33.124 --> 13:36.093
That panel controls the lights,
alarm, skylight, etc.

13:36.193 --> 13:37.854
Yeah, I probably won't
use any of that stuff.

13:37.928 --> 13:41.159
You know, since the party starts at 7.
- Party?

13:41.232 --> 13:44.895
I made it clear to Lisa you're not
to have any guests in here.

13:44.969 --> 13:48.302
You're the only one
allowed in the house.

13:49.140 --> 13:54.203
What? Lisa's not here?
- No. Of course not.

13:55.112 --> 13:58.309
Lisa's at the party...

13:59.416 --> 14:02.146
and I'm staying here.

14:02.253 --> 14:06.246
Is this concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?

14:08.626 --> 14:11.595
Don't touch the furniture.

14:14.765 --> 14:17.734
And this is my bird's room.

14:17.802 --> 14:21.203
He's got his own room?

14:23.374 --> 14:25.842
That's cool.

14:28.546 --> 14:32.004
How's my little boy?

14:32.082 --> 14:37.213
This is OJ.
- OJ? Like the murderer?

14:37.321 --> 14:42.258
No. Like the football player.
OJ Simpson.

14:42.359 --> 14:45.590
I've set the alarm.
When you hear it go off, feed him.

14:45.663 --> 14:49.497
Aw. What do I feed these little guys?

14:49.567 --> 14:55.597
They don't get fed. They are the food.
His diet varies, but they're his favorites.

14:55.673 --> 14:58.301
Hey, don't you have to shut these doors?

14:58.375 --> 15:01.970
Not anymore. He's been depressed
since his mate died.

15:02.046 --> 15:06.142
He won't fly. Just sits in his cage.

15:08.886 --> 15:13.880
Medication. Give him two
of these at 10:00.

15:13.991 --> 15:16.118
I have to shove these down his throat?

15:16.193 --> 15:19.788
Just one. The other is inserted
into his rectum.

15:19.864 --> 15:21.855
Don't worry. It's not
too unpleasant for him.

15:21.932 --> 15:27.165
He doesn't bite, does he?
- No. Not unless you taunt him.

15:27.238 --> 15:28.705
You're not planning on taunting him,
are you, Tom?

15:28.772 --> 15:30.171
No.
- I mean, that'd be really sick.

15:30.241 --> 15:32.573
No, of course not.

15:33.878 --> 15:36.779
And the most important thing,
make sure he gets a pint of water.

15:36.847 --> 15:39.247
The medication tends to dry him out
and then he can't breathe.

15:39.316 --> 15:41.546
OK.
- Well, I must be off.

15:41.652 --> 15:44.644
Henderson should be waiting outside.
- Henderson? I thought you fired him.

15:44.755 --> 15:46.814
Because his ideas were stupid?
Of course not.

15:46.924 --> 15:48.858
He's gonna drive me to the train station.

15:48.926 --> 15:52.521
So, you can leave as soon
as Lisa and Hans get back.

15:52.596 --> 15:54.928
Hans?
- Lisa's boyfriend.

15:55.833 --> 16:00.099
So remember, uh... water in the bowl,
medication, and...

16:00.170 --> 16:04.334
anything happens to this house
while I'm gone, I'll kill you.

16:08.646 --> 16:11.012
You're housesitting?
You gotta be kidding me.

16:11.081 --> 16:12.207
I know, it sucks.

16:12.283 --> 16:15.184
What are you talking about?
Don't you see? This is a test.

16:15.286 --> 16:17.618
You watch Taylor's house,
come up with a couple of great ideas

16:17.721 --> 16:19.655
and if everything goes smooth,
you get the promotion.

16:19.723 --> 16:22.783
You think so?
- Of course I do. What could be easier?

16:39.209 --> 16:42.542
What are you
doing, Hans? Come here.

16:42.613 --> 16:47.243
Baby, you're gonna burn so bad if you
don't let me put this on you right now.

16:51.255 --> 16:57.057
Oh, my God. You scared me, Hans.
You're insane. Put that down.

16:58.162 --> 17:02.360
Want to put some on me?
Put some lotion on me.

17:09.073 --> 17:12.839
Is Jack around?
- Hey... what? Who are you?

17:12.910 --> 17:16.936
It's OK. I'm Red Taylor. I'm Jack's son.
I let myself in the back.

17:17.013 --> 17:19.073
Oh. Hey. Tom Stansfield.
- Hey.

17:19.148 --> 17:22.641
Tom, nice to meet you.
Am I interrupting something here?

17:22.752 --> 17:27.952
Oh, no. Uh... I was... uh...
Oh, your shoes.

17:28.025 --> 17:32.189
Nike. Uh, listen, Tom, can you
do me a favor? I lost my TV Guide.

17:32.262 --> 17:36.289
I came over here to see if maybe
my dad's got a copy of one.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.858
You haven't seen a copy of
the guide laying around, have you?

17:38.936 --> 17:41.632
My sister in?
- No, actually she's out for the evening.

17:41.705 --> 17:45.334
Bingo.
- Oh.

17:45.409 --> 17:49.106
So, uh, you're here to...

17:50.014 --> 17:52.005
Housesit.
- Oh.

17:52.883 --> 17:57.650
Yeah, it's probably for the best if you
don't, uh, tell Lisa that I stopped by.

17:57.755 --> 18:01.953
Why? Is there a problem?
- Well, you know how uptight she is.

18:02.026 --> 18:05.052
Really?
- I'm more the free spirit of the family.

18:06.030 --> 18:10.797
Oh. Oh, boy. See that right there?

18:10.868 --> 18:13.894
Kirstie Alley?
- Yeah. I dated her maid.

18:15.205 --> 18:18.038
Really?
- I boned Kirstie Alley's maid.

18:18.108 --> 18:20.975
And this is while they were
making Look Who's Talking.

18:21.045 --> 18:22.842
Wow, that's really something.

18:22.913 --> 18:25.746
I'll tell you another thing.
You know Michelle Pfeiffer?

18:26.917 --> 18:29.852
I did the deed
with Michelle Pfeiffer's cousin.

18:29.920 --> 18:31.945
Wow.
- Right out there in those bushes.

18:32.056 --> 18:34.354
Right.
- Ah, she looked just like Michelle, too,

18:34.425 --> 18:36.450
except she was brunette
instead of blond,

18:36.560 --> 18:38.960
and she was kinda short and dumpy.

18:39.029 --> 18:42.590
Well, uh, ya certainly have
an interesting life, Fred.

18:42.666 --> 18:44.793
You married, Tom?

18:44.868 --> 18:47.496
No. I'm single.
- No girlfriend?

18:47.571 --> 18:51.530
No, and, no, actually I had a girlfriend,
but we, uh, broke up.

18:52.976 --> 18:57.072
Listen, I really gotta get back to work,
and since you got your TV Guide and...

18:57.147 --> 19:01.584
So, you broke up, huh? That's too bad.

19:01.685 --> 19:03.346
Was your ex a looker?
- Yeah.

19:03.454 --> 19:05.581
Yeah, in my opinion she was.

19:05.689 --> 19:10.126
I bet you still keep a picture
of her in your wallet.

19:10.194 --> 19:12.822
Yeah, I do.
- Can I see it?

19:12.896 --> 19:14.557
Yeah, I suppose.
- OK.

19:14.631 --> 19:17.429
Let me find her in here. There she is.

19:17.501 --> 19:21.403
Oh!
Tom, you lucky man!

19:21.472 --> 19:24.703
Yeah.
- Oh, she is a real piece of ass!

19:24.775 --> 19:28.267
Oh, I could knock on that back door
all day long!

19:28.345 --> 19:30.779
Yeah? Sh-she's a pretty girl.
- Wow.

19:30.848 --> 19:33.874
She has gotta be wicked in bed.
Tell me she's wicked in bed, Tom.

19:33.984 --> 19:36.077
I bet you she banged your johnson raw
every single night,

19:36.186 --> 19:37.983
OK...
...'cause that is one fine-looking broad.

19:38.088 --> 19:39.680
All right. Hey! Would ya...

19:39.790 --> 19:43.157
I me... You're talking about my girlfriend.

19:43.227 --> 19:46.719
Ex-girlfriend, you said.
- Yeah, but still, it's...

19:46.797 --> 19:50.255
Come on. I'm just making conversation.
You know, guy-talk.

19:50.334 --> 19:52.928
Look, I just... I don't tell comfortable

19:53.003 --> 19:56.803
talking about my intimate relationships
with a complete stranger.

19:56.874 --> 19:59.001
Understood.

19:59.076 --> 20:02.307
Well, you know, given how uptight
you are talking about sex,

20:02.379 --> 20:04.142
you pretty much
answered the question.

20:04.214 --> 20:06.580
I am not uptight! OK?

20:06.650 --> 20:09.847
Just because I don't feel like
revealing personal details

20:09.953 --> 20:13.821
about my ex-girlfriend's sexual habits
does not make me uptight.

20:13.891 --> 20:16.359
I didn't ask you anything personal.

20:16.460 --> 20:19.395
Well, then, what the hell
do you consider personal?

20:19.463 --> 20:23.126
Well, it'd be like, you know,
if I asked you how big your rod was.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.760
Then I would be out of line, 100%.

20:25.836 --> 20:30.466
No, no! That is no worse than
asking me if my girlfriend's a nymph.

20:30.541 --> 20:33.271
I just asked you if she dug sex.

20:33.343 --> 20:35.709
Besides, I wouldn't have asked
if I'd known she was frigid.

20:35.779 --> 20:38.339
Yeah, well, she is not frigid!

20:38.415 --> 20:40.383
Are you leaving?

20:40.450 --> 20:41.849
Oh, yeah.

20:41.952 --> 20:44.045
And listen. Could you do me a favor?

20:44.154 --> 20:45.621
It's no big deal.
- What?

20:45.722 --> 20:49.351
A business associate of my dad's
is gonna come by to pick this up.

20:49.426 --> 20:54.523
It's frozen steaks, it's a gift.
- It's not cold.

20:56.066 --> 20:59.263
Dad says that's the way the guy
likes'em. What are you gonna do?

20:59.336 --> 21:01.201
Will you give it to him?

21:03.440 --> 21:05.431
Just one second.

21:12.182 --> 21:13.581
Audrey.
- Tom.

21:13.617 --> 21:15.050
Let's go! Come on!

21:15.152 --> 21:18.178
Oh, I guess this makes sense.
He's got you living with him now?

21:18.288 --> 21:20.552
Uh, no. I'm just watching his place.

21:20.624 --> 21:23.388
He's... Jack's out of town.
- He is?

21:23.460 --> 21:26.190
Yeah.
- Aw, shoot!

21:26.263 --> 21:28.731
I came by 'cause I was
hoping to get my job back.

21:28.799 --> 21:30.323
You know, the one that
you got me canned from

21:30.400 --> 21:31.992
'cause I made a bad cup
of coffee? Remember that?

21:32.069 --> 21:33.366
Listen, I'm really sorry about that.

21:33.437 --> 21:35.735
How can you fire someone
for making a bad cup of coffee, huh?

21:35.806 --> 21:37.103
I know. That's what I tried to say to him.

21:37.174 --> 21:40.507
I mean, who do you think you are -
Juan fucking Valdez?

21:40.577 --> 21:40.838
I might have had a future at that place
if you'd just give me half a chance.

21:43.914 --> 21:47.850
Let's get a move on, saddlebag!
- Oh, my God. That's my idiot boyfriend.

21:47.951 --> 21:51.887
Hold your pants, you freakin' psycho!

21:51.955 --> 21:54.355
God. He drives me crazy.

21:54.424 --> 21:57.655
Oh, hey, you know, since you're on the
rug, would you mind putting these on?

21:57.728 --> 22:01.755
They're medical... I got'em on, too.
- Ugh! Licorice.

22:01.832 --> 22:05.131
I hate licorice. I need water
or I'm gonna throw up. Ugh!

22:05.202 --> 22:09.161
Thanks to you, I lost my second job
inside a month and now I'm flat broke.

22:09.239 --> 22:10.604
You lost another job?

22:10.674 --> 22:13.404
Yeah, I got fired from my waitress job
just last Friday.

22:13.477 --> 22:16.139
Why did they fire you?
- Oh, I don't know.

22:16.213 --> 22:18.738
One of the assistant managers
caught me making out with a customer.

22:18.815 --> 22:20.510
Excuse me?
- Well, I mean, actually the customer

22:20.584 --> 22:22.017
was my boyfriend.

22:22.119 --> 22:24.519
I mean, he became my boyfriend
after the incident anyway.

22:24.588 --> 22:27.386
You got any beer in here?
- Uh... Hey.

22:27.457 --> 22:29.823
Here we go.
- Would you mind putting these on?

22:29.893 --> 22:33.090
It's a house rule. Oh, actually,
that's a twist... Aah!

22:33.163 --> 22:37.896
That's the counter. Listen. Jack,
is just a real stickler. That'd be great.

22:37.968 --> 22:40.459
No kidding. I found that out this morning.

22:40.537 --> 22:42.129
I swear I am gonna freak out
and I'm gonna come in there...

22:42.205 --> 22:44.230
Oh, man. Spike's in a real mood.
- Uh...

22:44.308 --> 22:45.605
Don't even... hey.

22:45.676 --> 22:47.507
Come on, come on, come on. Shit.
- I swear to God, Audrey,

22:47.577 --> 22:50.307
I'll piss on this guy's front steps!
Let's go!

22:51.481 --> 22:54.678
If you don't open this door this second,
I'm gonna come in there and...

22:54.785 --> 22:55.752
Hi.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.080
Don't worry. Nothing broke.

22:57.187 --> 23:01.283
Hey. Baby, come on. What are you
doing leaving me in the goddamn car?

23:01.391 --> 23:02.949
Shake that tail, baby.
Come on. Let's get a move on.

23:03.060 --> 23:06.826
Hold your horses. Try acting civilized.
- Audrey!

23:06.897 --> 23:08.228
This is Tom, the guy that I was
telling you about from the office.

23:08.298 --> 23:10.232
Oh, the coffee dude.

23:10.300 --> 23:13.064
You got some black ass karma
headed your way, superfreak.

23:13.136 --> 23:16.071
Oh, we don't need no lecture
from you, Mr. High and Mighty.

23:16.139 --> 23:19.404
Hey, shut that sass-trap of yours, little
lady, before I bounce you off the wall!

23:19.476 --> 23:23.776
Look, I would appreciate it
if you would take this outside, please.

23:23.847 --> 23:28.648
Hey, I'd appreciate it if you'd go
and buy yourself a bagel, Jewy.

23:28.752 --> 23:31.414
Jewy? I'm not Jewish. And I don't
think that making fun of the...

23:31.521 --> 23:34.820
Don't pay attention to him. He's nuts.
- I'm nuts?

23:34.891 --> 23:37.382
Who do you think you are?
- Look, can we please take this outside?

23:37.494 --> 23:38.927
Oh, come on.

23:38.995 --> 23:41.691
You know what you are?
You're a filthy, little tramp.

23:41.765 --> 23:43.232
Me? What about you and that waitress?

23:43.300 --> 23:45.359
Keep going.
- I never touched her ever.

23:45.435 --> 23:47.300
Swear?
- So help me God.

23:47.371 --> 23:48.804
You swear on your mama's life?

23:48.872 --> 23:50.840
Hell, woman, I ain't gonna
swear on my mama's life.

23:50.907 --> 23:53.740
Why not? If you're telling the truth.
- I think he's telling the truth, Audrey.

23:53.810 --> 23:55.175
Then why won't you swear
on your mama's life?

23:55.245 --> 23:57.941
Well, because I don't feel
like I have the right

23:58.014 --> 23:59.504
to gamble with my mama's life,
that's why.

23:59.583 --> 24:01.915
Gamble? But apparently
you got nothing to worry about

24:02.018 --> 24:03.679
unless you're Iying like
a hunk of morgue meat.

24:03.787 --> 24:08.224
Hey, I ain't gonna sit here and get
called a liar by no skankin' whore!

24:08.291 --> 24:11.590
Who you calling a whore,
you shrimp-dick bastard?!

24:11.661 --> 24:12.753
Audrey, see now
you're just provoking him.

24:12.829 --> 24:14.228
That's a vicious, flat-out,
bold-faced lie and you know it!

24:14.297 --> 24:17.528
Is it? Is it? I don't think so!
- I'll whip it out right now!

24:17.601 --> 24:18.863
No, no, no. I don't wanna see it.
- I'm gonna whip it out right now

24:18.935 --> 24:21.563
and prove to you that she's a Iying slut!

24:21.638 --> 24:23.469
Keep your meat in the fridge!
- You wanna see my piece?

24:23.540 --> 24:25.872
All right. All right! That is enough!
- Go get me a ruler, Tom! You go get...

24:25.942 --> 24:29.434
That is it. I don't care
if you have a tiny shrimp dick!

24:31.181 --> 24:35.584
Or a giant whale dick, which that's...
- Goddamn it, Audrey!

24:35.685 --> 24:38.620
You tell him you're a liar or I'm gonna
smash your face in, I swear!

24:38.688 --> 24:43.853
Wait a minute! You put that down!
- All right. Can we please just use fists?

24:43.927 --> 24:46.828
Come here, you little...
- You hit me, you bastard!

24:46.897 --> 24:49.457
I did not and you know it!
- He hit me!

24:49.533 --> 24:51.592
He hit me as sure
as I'm standing right here!

24:51.668 --> 24:53.295
Did you hit her, Spike?
- Yes.

24:53.370 --> 24:55.201
With an open hand.
It was with an open hand.

24:55.272 --> 24:56.637
So what if it's open?
- You can't...

24:56.706 --> 24:58.173
Then it don't count.
- Says who?

24:58.241 --> 25:01.142
Says anyone. Ask the Jew.

25:01.211 --> 25:03.611
All right, that's it.
You two have got to leave.

25:03.680 --> 25:06.205
All right, that's fine.
But she is not coming with me.

25:06.283 --> 25:07.648
You are not welcome in the double ride.

25:07.717 --> 25:11.153
Fine, I don't care. I don't need your lousy
trailer. I'll stay right here with Tom.

25:11.221 --> 25:12.813
Fine. Stay with Tom.
- I'll stay right here.

25:12.923 --> 25:18.589
Wait a minute. Whoa. Guys, you need
to try to work this thing out.

25:18.662 --> 25:22.359
He hit me! He knocked me on my can!
- I know. I know.

25:22.432 --> 25:27.028
Well, but it was with
an open hand after all, and...

25:27.103 --> 25:30.630
Relationships have their
ups and downs, you guys,

25:30.707 --> 25:32.538
and you don't want to ruin this great...

25:37.681 --> 25:41.014
Oh, God. The bird. OJ!

25:43.420 --> 25:45.388
Oh, my God.

25:55.165 --> 25:59.761
You come back here or Tom's
gonna kick your butt! So take that!

25:59.836 --> 26:02.828
Ooh, I'm shaking
in my boots, baby!

26:02.906 --> 26:05.340
Look at those two, OJ.

26:08.178 --> 26:13.639
Oh, I ain't
running away, dummy!

26:13.717 --> 26:15.912
Hello?
- Hi, Tom. How are ya?

26:16.019 --> 26:19.887
Hey. Lisa, I'm great. I'm great.

26:20.757 --> 26:22.486
Is that OJ?
- Yeah, yeah.

26:22.559 --> 26:26.188
We just had a little drink of water.
- I haven't heard him squawk in years.

26:26.263 --> 26:30.256
Oh, yeah.
He's quite the crazy bird, you know.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.801
Yeah. Anyway, Tom,
I just wanted you to know

26:32.869 --> 26:35.997
how much I appreciate
you helping me out tonight.

26:36.072 --> 26:39.337
But I'd like to crash at a friend's place
tonight after the party.

26:39.409 --> 26:42.640
Would you think it was horrible if I asked
you to stay the whole night tonight?

26:42.712 --> 26:48.207
Oh, well... I-I don't think your dad
would want me staying here.

26:48.318 --> 26:52.118
Please?
- Yeah. I suppose I could stay.

26:52.188 --> 26:54.748
Thanks, Tom. I really appreciate it.
See you tomorrow.

26:54.858 --> 26:58.055
I ain't afraid of you and Tom
sure as hell ain't scared neither!

26:58.128 --> 27:02.121
Butthead! Loser!

27:04.367 --> 27:08.929
Oh, my God. Thank God he's gone.
Hey, so is it OK if I stay here tonight?

27:09.005 --> 27:12.805
Oh, man, it's... it's not even my house.

27:12.876 --> 27:14.810
Oh, yeah.

27:14.878 --> 27:17.244
OK. Well, I sure as hell
don't want any charity.

27:17.314 --> 27:21.683
I mean, it's not like you
owe me anything, so...

27:22.485 --> 27:23.975
And I'm sorry about
that whole office thing.

27:24.087 --> 27:25.486
I know that you didn't mean
to get me fired.

27:25.555 --> 27:30.424
Yeah. You didn't deserve to get fired.
- Thanks.

27:30.493 --> 27:32.518
OK.

27:32.596 --> 27:36.726
Well, I guess I'll just go try
to find a homeless shelter then.

27:40.203 --> 27:42.194
Wait a second.
- Yeah?

27:42.272 --> 27:44.137
God.

27:44.207 --> 27:49.839
Look, I suppose you can stay.
- Really? Oh! Thanks, Tom.

27:49.913 --> 27:51.938
You're the best. Oh, and I'll
clean up the kitchen, OK?

27:52.015 --> 27:55.007
OK.
- OK. OK.

28:09.933 --> 28:12.163
Yeah. One second.

28:12.235 --> 28:14.965
There's somebody at the door.

28:16.606 --> 28:18.733
Hi. Uh, can I help you?

28:18.808 --> 28:22.005
Vasquez sent me here
to pick up a package.

28:22.078 --> 28:25.639
Oh, you're the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Red told me you might be stopping by.

28:25.715 --> 28:27.410
Uh... Oh, hi. I'm Tom.

28:27.484 --> 28:30.453
What is this, Oprah?
Just give me the goddamn package.

28:30.553 --> 28:34.353
Oh, OK. Yeah. Um...

28:35.091 --> 28:37.582
I think this is it.

28:37.694 --> 28:40.492
If this ain't kosher,
I'm gonna break his thumbs.

28:40.563 --> 28:44.522
Oh, well, by law, it should be stamped
right on the package there.

28:46.136 --> 28:50.004
What...

28:54.344 --> 28:58.110
Oh. Dinnertime, buddy.

29:00.517 --> 29:06.717
OJ... today's specials include
a scrumptious buffet of mice kebabs.

29:06.823 --> 29:10.190
Aah! Shit! Ah... crap!

29:13.563 --> 29:15.326
You son of a bitch.

29:20.203 --> 29:23.172
I got you now, buddy.

29:33.249 --> 29:36.047
Dude, that was cool.
- Oh, my God.

29:36.953 --> 29:40.582
Tommy, easy on the antiques.

29:40.690 --> 29:44.387
Was that an owl?
- Yes. OJ got out. How is he flying?

29:44.461 --> 29:47.794
Well, he is a bird.
- He... no, Jack said that he...

29:47.864 --> 29:49.889
Aw, shit! I gotta find him.

29:49.966 --> 29:53.663
Don't worry. He'll probably
come back when he's hungry.

29:53.737 --> 29:57.434
No, I have to find him or I'm gonna
lose my job! You know what?

29:57.507 --> 30:00.567
This isn't gonna help your chances
of getting your job back either.

30:00.643 --> 30:02.042
OK.

30:02.112 --> 30:05.639
Where the hell is he?
- Tom, relax.

30:05.715 --> 30:08.206
Relax? OJ's loose!

30:08.284 --> 30:12.914
This is no time to relax!
- Tom! He's right over here!

30:13.590 --> 30:15.581
Right there, right there, right there!
- OJ!

30:15.692 --> 30:17.887
Right there!
- OJ!

30:17.961 --> 30:22.125
Stop! No, no. Stop. Stop.

30:22.198 --> 30:25.361
OJ. OJ...

30:25.435 --> 30:29.701
Get up. What the hell you doing
on my property? Planning to rob me?

30:29.773 --> 30:32.264
No. I-I was just looking for...

30:32.342 --> 30:36.779
Yeah, yeah. I see what you're looking
for. You got a thing for young girls, eh?

30:36.846 --> 30:38.040
No.

30:38.114 --> 30:40.605
Then why do you keep
eyeing my wife, you perv?

30:40.683 --> 30:43.083
Your... no, I wasn't looking. I...

30:43.186 --> 30:46.155
Arthur, are you gonna be back soon?
I need you to spot me.

30:46.222 --> 30:48.019
Just give me a minute, honey.

30:48.091 --> 30:50.423
Oh... Please don't kill me.
- I'm not gonna kill you, OK.

30:50.493 --> 30:54.725
If you let me live, I'll give you my
most valued possession. Here, take it.

30:54.798 --> 30:56.288
You know what that is, don't you?

30:56.366 --> 30:59.301
Evander Holyfield's ear.
- What?

30:59.369 --> 31:02.896
The part of the ear that
Mike Tyson bit off and spit out.

31:02.972 --> 31:04.963
But it's white.
- So?

31:05.041 --> 31:09.774
So, shouldn't it be black?
- Well, if it's still on his head, sure.

31:09.846 --> 31:13.213
But anybody knows that a
severed ear loses its color.

31:13.283 --> 31:14.944
No.
- Sheryl?

31:15.051 --> 31:17.178
Yeah?
- What happens to an ear

31:17.287 --> 31:21.519
if it's severed from your head?
- It changes color. Duh.

31:21.591 --> 31:24.355
Ow! Damn!

31:24.427 --> 31:26.725
Tina, give me a beer.

31:26.796 --> 31:28.696
Oops.
- You have got to be kidding me.

31:28.765 --> 31:31.233
Try another one.
- Come on, you guys!

31:31.301 --> 31:33.531
Party!

31:33.603 --> 31:36.629
Come on, let's go!
- Audrey...

31:36.706 --> 31:39.470
What the hell is going on in here?
- Heads up.

31:39.542 --> 31:40.531
Who are these people?

31:40.610 --> 31:43.374
I invited some friends over
to help us look for the owl.

31:43.446 --> 31:45.175
And Darryl even fixed
the table in the hall.

31:45.248 --> 31:47.148
Thank you.
- He won't even know it was broken.

31:47.217 --> 31:49.447
Air ball.

31:49.552 --> 31:52.487
We'll get that later.
Everyone, this is Tom.

31:52.555 --> 31:54.352
Yo, Tom.
- Hi, guys.

31:54.424 --> 31:55.823
You guys, Tom's a real good guy
and his nuts are gonna just...

31:55.892 --> 31:58.224
Audrey, could you...

31:59.796 --> 32:04.199
What?
- Listen, I appreciate all your help.

32:04.267 --> 32:07.759
But could you make sure that your
friends stay out of the house?

32:07.837 --> 32:11.637
All of them or just the colored guy?
- No, all of them.

32:12.275 --> 32:15.870
Ooh, that's smart. That way the
colored guy won't take it personal.

32:15.945 --> 32:19.073
I have nothing against... Look.
- What?

32:19.148 --> 32:20.581
I am responsible for this house

32:20.650 --> 32:23.380
and I can't have all of these
people hanging around.

32:23.486 --> 32:26.978
OK, all right. I got it.
You guys, let's move it out.

32:27.090 --> 32:29.718
Aw, I was just getting started.
- Good idea.

32:29.792 --> 32:32.158
Thanks, guys. That's great.

32:32.228 --> 32:35.823
What about the cake?
- Don't worry, they're all good people.

32:35.899 --> 32:38.595
They're not gonna steal nothing
or drink too much like the Indians.

32:38.668 --> 32:42.365
Look... just make sure they stay outside.

32:42.438 --> 32:44.963
OK?
- OK.

32:51.748 --> 32:53.511
Lisa?
- Hi, Tom.

32:53.583 --> 32:56.746
Uh, you're home? Why are you home?

32:56.853 --> 32:59.879
It's not worth going into.
I got in a huge fight with Hans.

32:59.989 --> 33:05.359
Oh. So... it's over?

33:06.396 --> 33:08.660
It's my own fault for dating
a guy my dad likes.

33:08.731 --> 33:09.720
Really?

33:09.799 --> 33:12.563
Yeah, he's one of his top marketing
execs. You know, Harvard Law.

33:12.635 --> 33:16.401
Comes from a good family, top
of the tennis letter at the country club.

33:16.472 --> 33:20.306
Tom, can I talk to you for a second?
- Audrey?

33:20.376 --> 33:23.539
Yeah. She came to, uh, talk to your dad.

33:24.614 --> 33:28.414
OK. I'm gonna go in my room.
You could stay if you want.

33:28.484 --> 33:30.452
OK.

33:30.553 --> 33:33.215
Tom?
- Audrey, I'll be right there, OK?

33:33.323 --> 33:34.915
OK.

33:35.024 --> 33:39.552
Or you could go.
- You know, maybe we could talk...

33:40.830 --> 33:42.422
...later.

33:42.498 --> 33:45.729
Here. How about this one?

33:45.802 --> 33:48.362
What's going on?
- We found the owl!

33:48.438 --> 33:51.737
Where is he?
- Uh, well, he got away.

33:51.808 --> 33:54.368
Where'd he go?
- He hopped somewhere in the bushes.

33:54.444 --> 33:56.605
That's right.
- What are you doing?

33:56.679 --> 34:00.080
Getting hamburger meat.
That's a good way to lure birds.

34:00.149 --> 34:03.744
They like hamburger meat?
- I don't know. I've never had a bird.

34:03.853 --> 34:06.378
But most animals respond to meat.
- It's a fact.

34:06.489 --> 34:09.286
Wanna help me separate the meat?

34:09.993 --> 34:12.188
Speed, tell Tom about
the Kennedy assassination.

34:12.261 --> 34:14.991
This is so cool, Tom, 'cause Speed
knows who killed JFK.

34:15.063 --> 34:17.429
No, ask him! Tom, ask him.

34:17.500 --> 34:20.297
Ask him who killed him.
- All right. All right.

34:20.370 --> 34:26.138
Who killed JFK?
- Desi Arnaz.

34:27.877 --> 34:32.405
Oh.
- His life just changed.

34:46.062 --> 34:47.085
Oh.

34:51.768 --> 34:55.465
Oh, God. Oh... oh... oh...

34:56.572 --> 34:59.507
Tom!
- Shit. Lisa.

35:00.743 --> 35:03.735
Uh, what are you doing in here?
- This is my closet.

35:03.813 --> 35:08.546
Oh. Oh... uh, I had
something in my pants.

35:09.185 --> 35:16.091
Um, I was feeding the mouse to the bird
and he, uh, ran down my pants.

35:16.793 --> 35:18.556
I'm sorry that, uh...

35:18.628 --> 35:21.062
Oh, look! There it is!
That way! The bedroom.

35:23.232 --> 35:25.564
Whoa. Watch out!
- Aah!

35:25.635 --> 35:29.594
Oh, my gosh. Are you OK?
- Yep. Yep, I'm good.

35:29.672 --> 35:31.663
Don't worry, we'll get it later.

35:33.576 --> 35:35.441
Oh, here. Let me help you.

35:35.511 --> 35:38.969
You know, I'm really glad you stayed.
I needed a good laugh tonight.

35:39.048 --> 35:42.142
Thanks. Wow. Yeah, could I make
a bigger ass out of myself?

35:42.251 --> 35:47.382
Do you want some wine?
- Uh, no, thanks.

35:47.490 --> 35:48.479
Yeah, sure.

35:48.591 --> 35:50.559
Cheers.
- Cheers.

35:52.962 --> 35:55.931
Oh, my God. Is that signed
by Walter Payton?

35:55.998 --> 36:00.128
Yeah. 'Sweetness', '85 Bears. Only the
greatest team ever to play the game.

36:00.203 --> 36:04.572
Shut up. Walter Payton,
Jim McMahon, Mike Singletary.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.870
You know what?
You may be the coolest girl ever.

36:06.943 --> 36:09.070
You like football?
- Yeah, I love it.

36:09.145 --> 36:11.079
I didn't know you guys liked football.

36:11.147 --> 36:13.945
Yeah. No, me and Paul
watch the game every Sunday.

36:14.016 --> 36:15.916
Paul, too?
- Yeah.

36:18.888 --> 36:21.288
Oh, what's that?

36:21.357 --> 36:24.588
Oh, it's nothing.
It's just something I used to do.

36:24.660 --> 36:28.562
That is really good.
I didn't know you were an artist.

36:28.631 --> 36:32.260
I used to be, but I couldn't get any more
of my friends to pose nude for me.

36:32.335 --> 36:36.362
You wouldn't be interested, would you?
- Uh...

36:36.439 --> 36:39.931
You're blushing. I was just joking.

36:40.009 --> 36:44.173
I'm not blushing. I just-I just
get red from time to time.

36:45.781 --> 36:47.112
You are so funny.

36:47.183 --> 36:50.641
No, seriously, you should really
pursue this. I mean, you're good.

36:50.720 --> 36:54.622
I would, but it doesn't really fit in
with my father's plan for me.

36:54.690 --> 36:58.126
Future of Midnight Owl Publishing.

36:58.194 --> 37:00.788
Oh, look! There it is.

37:00.863 --> 37:03.923
He's right there. Through the door.
- We'll get him. We'll get him.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.332
Whoa! Watch out!

37:06.402 --> 37:08.029
Are you OK?
- Your dad's gonna kill me.

37:08.104 --> 37:11.073
No, don't worry about it.
It's my brother's. My dad won't care.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.368
Oh, Red.

37:12.441 --> 37:14.409
Oh, so Dad told you?
- About what?

37:14.477 --> 37:17.173
The restraining order.
- How's that?

37:17.246 --> 37:20.579
Yeah, Red's not allowed within
100 yards of me, my dad, or this house.

37:20.650 --> 37:22.675
He... uh, he didn't-he didn't mention that.

37:22.785 --> 37:26.221
Red's a freak. You don't want
to be around my dad if he finds out

37:26.322 --> 37:28.756
anyone was in this house,
especially Red.

37:28.824 --> 37:30.451
It's like wherever he is, there's trouble.

37:30.526 --> 37:32.687
I mean, one time, he had this big party
'cause Dad was out of town

37:32.762 --> 37:34.059
and my dad came home early...

37:34.130 --> 37:38.260
Hey, uh... you know, since the mouse is
gone, what say we, uh, go back inside?

37:38.334 --> 37:40.495
OK.

38:07.396 --> 38:11.025
It was up for an Oscar? I hated it!
- I know!

38:11.100 --> 38:15.366
Oh, I hated that movie!
Man, I can't believe you.

38:15.438 --> 38:19.169
You're like... you're so different
from how you are at work.

38:19.242 --> 38:23.269
What am I gonna do? Like, walk around
with my Walter Payton jersey?

38:23.346 --> 38:27.476
No, no. I get it. It's, like, at work
you have to be Lisa Taylor:

38:27.550 --> 38:31.213
the, you know, loyal employee
to the family firm.

38:31.320 --> 38:32.719
And I have to be... Tom...

38:32.788 --> 38:37.487
Tom Stansfield: the guy
who will do anything for anybody.

38:39.061 --> 38:41.052
Yup. That's me.

38:42.865 --> 38:45.857
I swear, it's like I can just
talk to you about anything.

38:45.935 --> 38:48.597
I know, exactly. It's...

38:48.671 --> 38:52.232
Yeah, this is crazy.
- Yeah, it is.

38:53.376 --> 38:58.211
I guess it's because there's no
attraction between us, you know?

38:59.415 --> 39:02.179
You know, there's none
of that sexual tension.

39:02.285 --> 39:03.877
Yeah.
- It's like I'm with a girlfriend.

39:03.986 --> 39:06.113
It's great, isn't it?
- Yeah.

39:06.222 --> 39:08.452
I mean, maybe we could go to the mall
sometime and go shopping.

39:08.524 --> 39:10.549
That would be fun! Wouldn't it be fun?
- Yeah.

39:10.660 --> 39:12.628
Wait, you have to listen to this song.

39:12.728 --> 39:14.855
Come on, I need
someone to dance with!

39:14.930 --> 39:17.330
You don't want to see me dance.

39:17.400 --> 39:20.733
Come on, dance with me.
- I have no idea what I'm doing.

39:20.803 --> 39:24.569
Come on. Put your hands together.
Yeah! Now go underneath.

39:24.640 --> 39:26.608
What... like this?
- Yeah!

39:26.676 --> 39:29.907
Like that?
- Yeah!

39:29.979 --> 39:33.415
Hold on, hold on. Watch, watch, watch.

39:35.184 --> 39:38.449
Yeah! Oh...
- I'm trying to do too much.

39:41.891 --> 39:44.621
I'm a dancer.

39:44.694 --> 39:45.922
Catch me.
- Oh... what?

39:49.665 --> 39:51.360
I got you!
- Whoa!

39:54.170 --> 39:57.571
OK. I am doomed.

39:58.541 --> 40:00.532
Here.

40:03.446 --> 40:05.812
Oh, I love this song.

40:05.881 --> 40:08.714
My friend Jenny does this
really wild strip routine

40:08.784 --> 40:14.245
for her boyfriend to this song.
It's super sexy. Even you'd appreciate it.

40:14.357 --> 40:19.556
I wish I could be like her, you know?
She's so free and everything.

41:13.582 --> 41:15.607
So, what do you think?

41:15.684 --> 41:20.644
Ah, it's... it's, uh, very nice.

41:20.756 --> 41:24.214
So if you weren't gay,
this would turn you on, right?

41:25.127 --> 41:30.793
Gay? Who said I was gay?
- My father. You mean it's not true?

41:30.866 --> 41:33.699
No!
- No? God, I'm so embarrassed!

41:33.769 --> 41:37.466
I can't believe you'd let me do this!
- I didn't mean to... I mean, um...

41:37.540 --> 41:39.872
Why would your father say that I'm gay?

41:39.942 --> 41:44.504
I don't know. Well, you can't blame him
entirely. I mean, you are a little feminine.

41:44.580 --> 41:47.276
Don't be hurt.

41:48.651 --> 41:50.846
It's OK.

41:50.953 --> 41:53.649
Hans is a bit of feminine, too.

41:53.756 --> 41:57.351
What exactly did Hans do anyway?

41:58.227 --> 42:01.253
Well, it's not like he did just one thing.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.597
It's more about trust.

42:06.669 --> 42:10.435
Yeah. Trust is... it's important.

42:11.106 --> 42:13.836
Trust is everything.

42:13.909 --> 42:18.642
I don't know. Maybe it's me. It's like
I'm just sending out some kind of vibe.

42:18.714 --> 42:21.182
I can't attract a decent guy.
- No.

42:21.250 --> 42:23.411
What's wrong with me?
- Don't even worry about it.

42:23.519 --> 42:26.579
You're gonna find another guy so fast.

42:27.623 --> 42:32.219
I mean, look at you. You're amazing.

42:33.696 --> 42:37.996
You really think so?
- Why do you think I'm here tonight?

42:39.602 --> 42:42.867
Oh, God, Tom.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.734
You didn't know. You thought that...

42:59.388 --> 43:04.018
Uh... uh... I'm gonna... I'll be right back.

43:04.093 --> 43:08.655
I'm just gonna go and check
and see if Audrey needs towels.

43:08.731 --> 43:11.393
Tom, you don't have to lie to me.

43:11.467 --> 43:15.164
If you have to go to the bathroom,
go take a crap and come back.

43:26.248 --> 43:29.775
What the... hey! What the hell
are you doing here, man?

43:33.822 --> 43:37.986
You try to bone Vasquez out of 20 grand
and you ask me what I'm doing?

43:38.060 --> 43:42.224
You think I work for Mrs. Fields? You
think my boss likes to bake cookies?

43:42.998 --> 43:46.161
Whoa! What are you doing? Come on.
- You tried to sell me flour.

43:46.235 --> 43:50.171
Flour? I-I don't even know what
you're talk... What are you... Come on!

43:50.239 --> 43:52.503
Look, I'm just housesitting for my boss.

43:52.575 --> 43:55.669
Who's your boss?
- Jack Taylor.

43:55.744 --> 44:01.011
Jack Taylor, huh? I did time
in Joliet with a Jack Taylor.

44:01.083 --> 44:06.043
Average height, medium hair,
horrible case of folliculitis on his ass?

44:06.121 --> 44:09.613
I wouldn't know about the folliculitis.
- I thought you said he was your boss.

44:09.725 --> 44:12.785
He is.
- And you never saw his ass?

44:12.861 --> 44:15.659
Why would I see my boss's ass?
- It stands to reason.

44:15.731 --> 44:19.098
You work for a guy long enough,
sooner or later,

44:19.168 --> 44:22.069
you're gonna get a glimpse of his ass.

44:23.739 --> 44:25.730
Listen, I-I don't know
what line of work you're in,

44:25.808 --> 44:28.902
but I've never seen my boss's ass.

44:28.944 --> 44:31.742
Hey, man...

44:31.814 --> 44:34.544
Hey! Hey, stop it
or I'm gonna call the cops!

44:34.617 --> 44:38.246
And tell them what?
Your drug deal went bad?

44:38.354 --> 44:40.788
You rat me out, I'm gonna
carve you up like a turkey

44:40.856 --> 44:43.552
and beat your kids
with what's left of you.

44:43.626 --> 44:46.959
I don't have any kids.
- I can wait.

44:56.171 --> 45:01.131
Excuse me. Hello? Right. OK.

45:02.478 --> 45:04.776
Tommy, let's get clear on something.

45:04.847 --> 45:08.647
In the next 60 minutes, I'm gonna
bring Vasquez what he paid for

45:08.717 --> 45:11.447
or your gift-wrapped nuts.

45:18.027 --> 45:20.188
Oh, hi, Tom. What's going on?
- Yeah. That's what I wanna know.

45:20.262 --> 45:23.561
What's going on with your dad's gift?
See... Do you see that guy?

45:23.632 --> 45:25.190
He was gonna kill me!

45:25.267 --> 45:27.167
Don't you think you're
overreacting a little, Tom?

45:27.236 --> 45:32.173
Overreacting? The guy had a knife!
I don't think that I am overreacting!

45:32.241 --> 45:34.368
He probably just had the wrong address.

45:34.443 --> 45:38.709
I mean, there's gotta be over a dozen
Jack Taylor's in Chicago alone.

45:38.781 --> 45:42.148
I'm gonna go to my dad's bedroom.
You tell me if the guy shows up again.

45:42.217 --> 45:43.809
All right. All right. You listen to me.

45:43.919 --> 45:46.080
You're not even supposed
to be in this house.

45:46.188 --> 45:47.155
Says who?

45:47.256 --> 45:49.986
I know about the restraining order, Red.

45:50.059 --> 45:54.723
Restraining-shmaining. I mean,
that's just a big misunderstanding.

45:54.797 --> 45:56.424
Tom! It's OJ!

46:02.571 --> 46:07.167
Whoa. Hey. Who are you?
- I'm here to see Lisa. My name's Hans.

46:09.378 --> 46:10.811
Is that so shocking?
- No.

46:10.879 --> 46:12.540
What, you surprised she'd go out
with someone like me?

46:12.614 --> 46:13.842
No, no. It's not...

46:13.916 --> 46:16.441
Give me a break, man.
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

46:16.552 --> 46:18.816
Let me tell you something.
There are a lot of girls out there

46:18.921 --> 46:21.321
who can see past the fact
that I just happen to be...

46:21.390 --> 46:22.857
a few pounds overweight.

46:22.925 --> 46:25.393
You know, inside
I'm just like everyone else.

46:25.461 --> 46:28.555
Let me get you a tissue.
- Thank you.

46:28.630 --> 46:30.723
I'm on the second day of a new diet.
- Hey, uh, Hans...

46:30.799 --> 46:32.630
I gave up chocolate.
- I'm really sorry.

46:32.701 --> 46:35.329
I think that, uh, we just
got off on the wrong foot.

46:35.404 --> 46:40.808
Oh... uh... It's good
to meet you, Hans. I'm Tom.

46:42.177 --> 46:44.941
I'm just a friend of Lisa's.

46:45.013 --> 46:48.107
Oh, great. Well, maybe you can
help me. Is she here? Lisa! Lisa!

46:48.183 --> 46:49.775
Whoa. Hans, you know what?

46:49.885 --> 46:52.854
Maybe right now isn't a great time
for you to see Lisa.

46:52.921 --> 46:54.980
What say, uh, we get you a drink?

46:55.090 --> 46:57.957
Oh, OK. Yeah, she's
probably really upset.

46:58.026 --> 47:02.520
You see, we got in a misunderstanding
tonight and, well, she left me.

47:02.598 --> 47:04.691
Wow, that's unfortunate.
- Yeah.

47:04.767 --> 47:06.598
Uh, what happened?

47:06.668 --> 47:10.900
Well, I think seeing me naked from
behind like that kind of shocked her.

47:10.973 --> 47:14.909
Oh. So, tonight was the first time.

47:14.977 --> 47:17.741
Yeah. Tonight was the first time.
It was awesome.

47:17.813 --> 47:20.976
I mean, I was Iying up on the bed like
this with one leg straight up in the air.

47:21.049 --> 47:22.914
I don't think I really need to see...
- And I had a handful of ass right here...

47:23.018 --> 47:23.985
Whoa.
...and I had a handful of this.

47:24.086 --> 47:27.681
Hans, please. Whoa.
God, you're... that's...

47:28.323 --> 47:32.259
And that's when Lisa walked in.
- What?

47:32.361 --> 47:35.057
She caught me in the bed with a blonde.

47:35.130 --> 47:36.620
What?

47:36.698 --> 47:39.394
Aw, come on, man. Tell me you
haven't ever wanted to do it with a...

47:39.468 --> 47:42.596
Hans. Hans. No... you cheated on her.

47:44.306 --> 47:47.400
You know something, Tom?
You're right.

47:47.476 --> 47:52.243
Aw. I guess that was cheating.
And now I've gone and lost everyone.

47:52.314 --> 47:54.908
I should have known
from the start it wasn't right.

47:54.983 --> 47:57.474
She kept telling me
I reminded her of her dad.

47:57.553 --> 48:00.545
Hans, you gotta realize
that this is over, you know?

48:00.656 --> 48:04.217
And you gotta put an end to it,
and-and move on.

48:04.326 --> 48:07.762
And get yourself to a better place, OK?
- Yes.

48:07.830 --> 48:11.960
I think you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do know what you mean.

48:12.034 --> 48:16.095
And I'm ready. I know what I have to do.

48:20.409 --> 48:22.639
Well, I guess this is good-bye.

48:25.981 --> 48:30.042
OJ!

48:30.152 --> 48:31.881
Thanks, Tom.

48:31.987 --> 48:33.921
OJ, come back!

48:36.658 --> 48:38.683
OJ!

48:49.238 --> 48:52.799
Hello. You must be Julie's date.
Come in. Come in.

48:52.875 --> 48:56.276
Actually I'm just here looking for a bird.

48:56.345 --> 48:59.803
Make yourself at home, Albert.
Julie's still getting ready.

48:59.882 --> 49:03.079
No, actually, uh, my name is Tom.
- I'm sorry. I'm hard of hearing.

49:03.185 --> 49:05.676
Could you speak up, please?
- My name is Tom!

49:05.787 --> 49:08.187
I could've sworn Julie
said your name was Albert.

49:08.257 --> 49:09.918
No, see, I'm afraid that you're mistaken.

49:09.992 --> 49:14.224
Is someone here?
- Yes. This is Julie's date, Albert.

49:14.296 --> 49:15.923
Ah! Ah!
- This is my nephew, George.

49:15.998 --> 49:20.230
He's blind and crippled.
- Oh. Uh... nice to meet you.

49:20.302 --> 49:21.530
I'm not deaf.

49:21.603 --> 49:26.233
Excuse me. I'll go see what's
keeping Julie. She's probably nervous.

49:26.308 --> 49:28.173
So you're Julie's date, huh?

49:28.243 --> 49:31.440
No. I'm just... I just came here.
I was looking for an owl.

49:31.513 --> 49:35.381
You don't have
to make lame excuses.

49:35.484 --> 49:39.181
Listen, do you know what the
advantage is in being a cripple?

49:39.288 --> 49:41.119
No, I can't say that I do.

49:41.189 --> 49:43.487
You don't really care to hear much
what I have to say, do you?

49:43.558 --> 49:46.288
No, no. It's not that. I'm...

49:47.329 --> 49:49.297
You know what?
Go ahead, I'm listening.

49:49.364 --> 49:51.594
Sit down, Tom.

49:55.570 --> 49:58.061
You know what I gained
by becoming a quad?

49:58.140 --> 50:00.165
What, are you shaking your head?
I can't see, you know!

50:00.242 --> 50:05.077
I'm sorry. Uh... uh...
Tell me what you gained.

50:05.147 --> 50:08.082
I no longer need my Viagra.

50:08.951 --> 50:12.478
Now I can maintain
my arousal for hours.

50:12.587 --> 50:15.078
That's-that's great.
I guess things have a way

50:15.190 --> 50:16.885
of evening themselves out
in the long run, huh?

50:16.959 --> 50:19.393
No, not really. And do you know why?

50:19.461 --> 50:20.792
No, why?

50:20.862 --> 50:23.353
Because I am a blind,
quad freak, you moron!

50:23.432 --> 50:25.400
What, you think women dig this?!

50:25.467 --> 50:26.695
I mean, you think women go...
- Well, hello.

50:26.768 --> 50:28.736
...'I wanna give that mutant
freak my number'?

50:28.804 --> 50:32.035
Ken Morehouse. I'm Julie's dad.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

50:32.107 --> 50:35.599
Is, uh, George boring you
with his self-pitying tripe?

50:35.677 --> 50:38.009
Tripe...
- No, not at all.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.311
'I'm blind. I'm crippled. Boohoo-hoo.'

50:41.383 --> 50:44.409
Leave the room. I wanna talk
to Albert alone for a second.

50:44.519 --> 50:46.885
I can stay if I want.
- Leave the room!

50:46.955 --> 50:48.149
OK, OK.
- Get out!

50:48.256 --> 50:50.656
You don't have to be huffy about it!
- Get out now! Get out!

50:50.726 --> 50:54.321
OK.
- Turn it, turn it, turn it.

50:54.396 --> 50:57.365
Oh, for God's sakes.

50:57.432 --> 51:00.401
I'm so sorry.
- Who the hell put that there?

51:01.536 --> 51:04.937
My daughter's gonna be a few minutes.
Have a-Have a seat, Albert.

51:05.007 --> 51:06.702
Tom.
- No. Ken.

51:06.775 --> 51:08.072
Right. You're Ken.
- Yes.

51:08.143 --> 51:11.544
Before you say anything, Albert,
I just want you to know that Julie

51:11.613 --> 51:16.141
is really self-conscious about her
appearance since the... the accident.

51:16.251 --> 51:17.309
Right...

51:17.419 --> 51:21.879
Oh, Julie.
- Julie, this is Albert. Albert, Julie.

51:21.990 --> 51:25.756
It's nice to meet you, Albert.
- Wow. It's... wow.

51:25.827 --> 51:31.197
It's nice to meet you, too.
But, the thing is, is that I'm not Albert.

51:32.968 --> 51:36.995
That is to say that I'm not your date.
- Oh...

51:37.072 --> 51:40.041
There's been a giant misunderstanding.

51:40.108 --> 51:43.635
Oh, how could you?
- I knew this would happen!

51:43.712 --> 51:45.976
No, I'm telling the truth.

51:46.048 --> 51:49.074
Julie wasn't pretty enough
for you, Mr. GQ? Is that it?

51:49.184 --> 51:53.644
No, you don't understand.
- Oh, I understand, Fabio.

51:53.755 --> 51:56.622
You broke that poor girl's heart.
- No, no. See, I'm not...

51:56.691 --> 52:00.092
Do you think Julie is an idiot? Do you
think she bought your little fairy tale

52:00.162 --> 52:02.722
Mr. I'm Too Sexy
for my medical booties?

52:03.632 --> 52:06.192
Oh, th...
- Get the hell out of here.

52:06.268 --> 52:10.864
Or I'll kick your pretty-boy ass
to kingdom come.

52:10.939 --> 52:14.875
Am I interrupting something?
- No, it's just that the...

52:19.381 --> 52:22.077
Tom, there's two things
that we need to talk about.

52:22.150 --> 52:23.139
What?

52:23.251 --> 52:25.515
First of all, I don't wanna
wear these booties anymore.

52:25.620 --> 52:28.555
No one else is wearing the booties.
- Fine.

52:28.623 --> 52:32.354
What's the other thing?
- Tina thinks she's got cancer.

52:34.296 --> 52:36.389
Do you feel it?
- Uh, I'm just...

52:36.465 --> 52:40.834
What's supposed to be there? I don't...
- See, Tina?

52:40.902 --> 52:44.065
Move your hand to the left.
Now move it around.

52:46.408 --> 52:50.105
Don't you feel anything?
- Yeah. I mean, no, no.

52:50.178 --> 52:51.941
No, it seems to be... Well...

52:52.013 --> 52:54.573
Tina, your breast is no
different than mine, OK?

52:54.649 --> 52:59.746
It is. There's no comparison.
- Tom, feel my breast and compare.

52:59.855 --> 53:02.653
Now, do you detect any difference
between our breasts?

53:02.724 --> 53:05.818
Well... You gotta slow down a little.
- It sure feels good.

53:05.894 --> 53:08.419
Well, yours is a...

53:08.497 --> 53:11.796
Lisa, this isn't what it looks like.
- I believed everything you said.

53:12.334 --> 53:13.323
I'm...

53:13.401 --> 53:14.891
It was all just a bunch of lines, wasn't it?

53:14.970 --> 53:19.066
No, no. Lisa, it was all...
I swear to you, I meant every word.

53:19.141 --> 53:20.608
This is... nothing's going on here.

53:20.675 --> 53:23.542
Great, Tom. I'm glad you think
I'm a complete idiot.

53:23.612 --> 53:28.481
No, no. I'm telling you. I was just
checking these girls for breast cancer.

53:29.050 --> 53:33.714
You make me sick.
- No... Lisa, wait!

53:34.389 --> 53:37.119
She's never gonna forgive me.
- Of course she will.

53:37.192 --> 53:38.352
Is this the first time you cheated on her?

53:38.426 --> 53:41.759
Yeah. No! I... yeah... wait.

53:41.830 --> 53:45.322
I didn't cheat on her. I mean,
you were there for God's sakes!

53:45.400 --> 53:46.924
Look, I know that
you didn't cheat on her.

53:47.002 --> 53:49.197
I mean, you were a little grabby, but...
- I...

53:49.271 --> 53:50.829
Look, don't you think
we should just find the owl

53:50.906 --> 53:52.771
and worry about your little 'affair' later?

53:52.841 --> 53:55.867
I... I am get... I'm getting angry
and I don't get angry.

53:55.944 --> 53:57.434
Ugh!
- Hey, Speed?

53:57.512 --> 53:59.673
Hey, can I ask you a question?

54:00.882 --> 54:05.319
What are you... I thought you left.
- I did... to get this.

54:06.054 --> 54:09.785
All right. Why is the fire going?
- Cozy, isn't it?

54:09.858 --> 54:13.794
All right. You put that down.
- Make me.

54:15.063 --> 54:17.054
All right.

54:19.034 --> 54:23.232
Hey! Hey! Put the crowbar down!

54:23.305 --> 54:26.763
Or I will blow your ass to fucktown!

54:38.420 --> 54:41.321
That's right.

54:42.724 --> 54:45.716
Don't you ever threaten me.
- But... I got a gun.

54:47.929 --> 54:51.558
What are you doing?
- Well, Tommy, we both have guns.

54:51.633 --> 54:54.363
Only difference is, you don't
have the guts to use yours.

54:54.436 --> 54:58.964
Oh, yeah?
Well, what makes you so sure?

55:00.475 --> 55:02.500
Oh, I'm sure.

55:09.351 --> 55:15.620
Oh! Oh... Jesus! What the...
What are you, out of your mind?

55:15.690 --> 55:19.456
Stop that! Are you crazy, man?!

55:21.429 --> 55:24.296
Hello?
- Stansfield. Anything to report?

55:24.366 --> 55:28.029
Sir! Uh, everything's great.
I got... everything's under control.

55:28.069 --> 55:30.003
Did OJ get enough water?
- Whoa!

55:30.071 --> 55:32.437
Uh, OJ... What? Oh, yes.

55:32.507 --> 55:36.238
Uh, Jack, could you hold on?
I'm gonna shoot your pecker off.

55:36.311 --> 55:38.905
I don't plan on being away
the entire weekend.

55:38.980 --> 55:40.038
I hate you! I hate you!
- It's possible I may be

55:40.115 --> 55:44.381
coming home early, so make sure
that everything's in order.

55:44.486 --> 55:45.453
Jesus!

55:45.553 --> 55:47.316
Oh, something I forgot to tell you.

55:47.422 --> 55:50.391
Sir?
- The fishtank. It's a little low.

55:50.492 --> 55:52.460
I'm taking care of that right now.
- Good.

55:52.527 --> 55:55.223
When I get back, I want to talk to you
about that position in Creative.

55:55.297 --> 55:57.322
Aah!
- Don't get excited yet.

55:57.399 --> 55:59.299
I didn't say you had the job.
We'll discuss it.

55:59.367 --> 56:02.598
Uh, thank you, sir. Uh, great. Bye.

56:04.506 --> 56:06.940
Holy shit!

56:10.245 --> 56:12.611
I just...

56:14.449 --> 56:18.613
Boy, I'm tapped out.
You got anything to drink?

56:18.720 --> 56:22.679
In the kitchen. Thanks.

56:27.195 --> 56:28.628
Dammit!

56:28.697 --> 56:34.329
Whoa! What the hay happened in here?
Tom, did you have a little accident?

56:34.402 --> 56:38.304
You might wanna try a few Kegels.
Kinda tighten it up down there.

56:38.373 --> 56:43.970
That's it!
- I'm doing'em right now. And release.

56:44.045 --> 56:47.879
Well, when in Rome...

56:47.949 --> 56:51.885
Oh, Canada

57:01.296 --> 57:06.029
'Jack Taylor. Rectacid.
Apply liberally to buttocks as needed

57:06.101 --> 57:10.663
to reduce redness
and other symptoms of folliculitis.'

57:14.209 --> 57:16.439
Son of a bitch.

57:16.511 --> 57:20.709
Did you piss yourself?
- No, I did not piss myself.

57:20.782 --> 57:22.215
Looks like you did.
- Well, I didn't.

57:22.283 --> 57:24.308
It was that maniac downstairs.

57:24.419 --> 57:27.081
We gotta stop him before
he tears this house apart.

57:27.188 --> 57:30.180
You know what you gotta do?
Give him one of these little babies.

57:30.291 --> 57:31.519
What's that?
- It's a sleeping pill.

57:31.593 --> 57:35.393
I got'em from Speed. Here.
So strong, so be careful.

57:35.463 --> 57:37.556
It's powerful stuff.
- Here. Just one.

57:37.632 --> 57:41.159
Be careful.

57:44.739 --> 57:46.730
Hey. Excuse me.

57:46.808 --> 57:50.335
You know, I just wanted to apologize
for pulling that gun on you earlier.

57:50.412 --> 57:53.870
That was totally out of line.

57:53.948 --> 57:56.382
Hey, you know, I don't
even know your name.

57:56.484 --> 57:59.647
I'm TJ.
- TJ? That's nice.

57:59.754 --> 58:05.317
I guess maybe I was out of line
by pissing all over everything.

58:05.427 --> 58:10.023
Man... that was funny.

58:10.098 --> 58:14.694
Yeah, I've always enjoyed a good prank.
What are you drinking there?

58:14.769 --> 58:17.033
Whiskey. You want some?

58:17.105 --> 58:18.572
There's plenty of booze
around here, that's for sure.

58:18.640 --> 58:21.200
Yeah, I'll take a shot of bourbon.

58:21.276 --> 58:24.336
Oh, my God! Wow!
- What?

58:24.412 --> 58:26.437
Whoa! Look at those
two blondes going at...

58:26.514 --> 58:28.311
Oh, wait, are there three of them?
- Where?

58:28.383 --> 58:31.284
They're going at it right up there
on the second floor.

58:31.352 --> 58:37.154
Where are you looking?
- Right th... uh... Oh, man, they left.

58:38.860 --> 58:43.058
Damn. I was all psyched up
for some action.

58:43.131 --> 58:46.396
Lesbians are very special.

58:46.468 --> 58:49.869
Oh... Hey, I'll drink to that, huh?

58:51.072 --> 58:54.132
Cheers.
- All right.

58:54.209 --> 58:56.541
Mmm.

58:58.012 --> 58:59.274
Oh, are you...

58:59.347 --> 59:02.009
Whoa.
- Here. Why don't I...

59:18.166 --> 59:22.102
Audrey?

59:22.170 --> 59:25.503
Audrey!

59:25.573 --> 59:29.907
Oh, my God!
He's like a human vibrator.

59:29.978 --> 59:32.242
What... All right,
what is wrong with him?

59:32.313 --> 59:34.804
I don't know. Did you slip him the pill?
- Yes.

59:34.883 --> 59:35.872
Then that must be it then.

59:35.984 --> 59:37.781
You didn't give him the pill
with whiskey, did you?

59:37.886 --> 59:39.877
Yeah.
- Oh, no!

59:39.988 --> 59:43.549
You're not supposed to mix the two.
- Audrey, you did not tell me that!

59:43.658 --> 59:46.218
Everyone knows that you're not
supposed to mix booze with pills!

59:46.294 --> 59:49.161
Come on!
- OK. Is he gonna be OK?

59:49.230 --> 59:52.222
Don't worry. He'll be fine.
I used to be a paramedic.

59:52.300 --> 59:56.066
Tom? I think I found OJ.
- OJ? I don't care about...

59:56.137 --> 59:58.901
We have a situation here.
Audrey, call 911!

59:58.973 --> 01:00:01.771
I'm telling ya, he'll be fine.
- Are you sure?

01:00:01.843 --> 01:00:05.176
He just needs some rest. I'm positive.
- OK. You watch TJ. Use this.

01:00:05.246 --> 01:00:07.942
It's not loaded, but he doesn't know that.

01:00:08.016 --> 01:00:09.574
Oh, man!

01:00:11.519 --> 01:00:14.249
Oh, hey.
- Julie.

01:00:14.355 --> 01:00:16.653
From... yeah.
- Down the block. That's right.

01:00:16.724 --> 01:00:17.713
You mind if I come in?

01:00:17.825 --> 01:00:19.019
All right. You grab his ankles...

01:00:19.093 --> 01:00:21.118
Why don't we go
to that room over there?

01:00:21.195 --> 01:00:24.756
OK, yeah, I got this end.
- Man, he's heavy.

01:00:24.832 --> 01:00:29.098
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:33.334
Uh... yeah. Sure.
- Thank you.

01:00:37.145 --> 01:00:40.512
Oh, hey. Sorry to butt in. Hi, I'm Red.

01:00:40.582 --> 01:00:42.948
Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet ya.

01:00:43.051 --> 01:00:46.543
Anyway, I realized you were telling
the truth when my real date showed up.

01:00:46.654 --> 01:00:51.114
Of course he didn't stick around.
- Well, that guy is a bum.

01:00:51.225 --> 01:00:53.250
Well, I'm sure that had
nothing to do with you.

01:00:53.361 --> 01:00:54.760
No, I know it did.

01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:58.595
I've never had any guys attracted to me,
even before the accident.

01:00:58.666 --> 01:01:00.793
Now that cannot be true.

01:01:00.868 --> 01:01:04.269
Well... about six months ago,
I was hitchhiking

01:01:04.339 --> 01:01:07.399
and a trucker tried to rape me,
but other than that...

01:01:07.475 --> 01:01:10.911
Come on. You're gonna tell me,
you never had a real boyfriend?

01:01:10.979 --> 01:01:14.881
Well, once, but I think
he just felt sorry for me.

01:01:14.949 --> 01:01:18.180
Oh, well, uh... how long did that last?

01:01:18.286 --> 01:01:22.655
Um... about six years
and then one day, he just left.

01:01:22.724 --> 01:01:26.592
Another woman?
- No. He got hit by a bus.

01:01:26.661 --> 01:01:28.253
Well, see that's not your fault.

01:01:28.329 --> 01:01:30.695
Well, he didn't seem to try
very hard to avoid the bus.

01:01:30.765 --> 01:01:33.325
I think he just wanted
out of the relationship.

01:01:33.401 --> 01:01:35.995
Julie, why don't you sit in this chair?

01:01:36.070 --> 01:01:38.436
Oh, geez, I'm starting
to feel a bit woozy.

01:01:40.708 --> 01:01:43.905
OK. All right, I have to go find OJ.

01:01:43.978 --> 01:01:48.506
So, Red, if you could watch things
for me, that'd be great.

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:51.746
Got ya.

01:01:54.989 --> 01:01:58.425
Look, I think you're being
way too hard on yourself.

01:01:58.526 --> 01:02:02.792
I mean, besides, I bet there've been a lot
of guys who've been attracted to you.

01:02:02.864 --> 01:02:05.526
No, he was the only one.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:09.229
What about that trucker? I mean,
he was obviously attracted to you.

01:02:09.303 --> 01:02:12.238
I think the trucker probably
would have raped anyone.

01:02:12.306 --> 01:02:16.037
I doubt that. You were probably
pretty special to him.

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:18.305
So sweet of you, Red.

01:02:18.379 --> 01:02:21.507
I'm not just jerking
your chain either. I mean it.

01:02:21.582 --> 01:02:24.483
Yeah.

01:02:28.156 --> 01:02:33.219
What are you doing to the lawn?
- It's OK, Tom. We just had to bury TJ.

01:02:33.294 --> 01:02:37.025
Bury... what? You mean, he's...

01:02:38.032 --> 01:02:41.160
You said he was gonna be OK!
I thought you were a paramedic.

01:02:41.235 --> 01:02:44.671
Well, I took a course.
- You took... you-you guy...

01:02:44.739 --> 01:02:46.639
You can't just bury him, you guys!

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.573
Well, we're not gonna put him in my car.

01:02:48.643 --> 01:02:52.101
That's right.
- All right. Forget it. I'm calling 911.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.978
That's for emergencies.
- What do you think this is?

01:02:55.049 --> 01:02:58.177
The guy's dead. In 20 minutes,
he's still gonna be dead.

01:02:58.286 --> 01:03:00.720
There's no sense of urgency here.

01:03:00.788 --> 01:03:03.848
No, we have to call the cops
and report it!

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:09.191
And tell'em what?
- The truth! That there was a... accident.

01:03:09.263 --> 01:03:13.597
They might not see it that way.
- Let's face it, Tom. You did kill him.

01:03:13.668 --> 01:03:17.126
You gave me the pill.
- Hey, I didn't tell you to kill nobody, OK?

01:03:17.205 --> 01:03:18.900
Well, you didn't tell me
not to use the whiskey!

01:03:18.973 --> 01:03:22.033
Well, if you'd listen to me...
- You didn't say anything about whiskey!

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:23.907
I would think you would listen to me!

01:03:23.978 --> 01:03:25.502
There's no time for blame games.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.310
Why don't you spread around
some leaves? Make it look good.

01:03:28.382 --> 01:03:31.351
I am not gonna help
you conceal a dead body!

01:03:31.452 --> 01:03:34.580
Hey, you know what? Don't you
think we should say something?

01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:35.951
What?
- You know what? She's right.

01:03:36.023 --> 01:03:38.753
Some kind of last rites or eulogy
or something like that?

01:03:38.826 --> 01:03:41.090
I'm so screwed.
- We should say something.

01:03:41.162 --> 01:03:47.726
Fine, fine. You know what? Say
something. Get... just make it quick.

01:03:47.802 --> 01:03:53.866
Lord, this day we lay to rest TJ,
who was, uh...

01:03:54.475 --> 01:03:56.443
I really didn't know him.
- I don't know him.

01:03:56.511 --> 01:03:58.308
I mean, Tom, you know him the best.
Why don't you say something?

01:03:58.379 --> 01:03:59.869
Me?
- Yeah.

01:03:59.947 --> 01:04:04.441
All I know is that the guy was a violent,
sadistic goon that was into lesbians.

01:04:04.552 --> 01:04:06.850
Amen.

01:04:06.954 --> 01:04:10.355
Tom?
- Lisa.

01:04:10.424 --> 01:04:13.188
I can't believe you're still here.
- Listen, please.

01:04:13.261 --> 01:04:14.455
You have to let me explain.

01:04:14.529 --> 01:04:18.295
Look, Tom. Tonight was just a
big mistake. That's all there is to it.

01:04:18.366 --> 01:04:25.204
No, you... that... what you saw with
the girls, all that was weird timing.

01:04:25.273 --> 01:04:28.003
Red? What's Red doing here?

01:04:28.075 --> 01:04:31.943
Red? Oh, uh, Red
was in the neighborhood

01:04:32.013 --> 01:04:33.537
and he-and he stopped by.

01:04:33.614 --> 01:04:36.777
But, you see, nothing really
bad happened tonight.

01:04:36.884 --> 01:04:42.618
Is he the reason OJ's gone?
- No. No, uh... OJ got loose.

01:04:42.690 --> 01:04:45.181
And that's a little problem.
But we're gonna find him.

01:04:45.293 --> 01:04:47.761
And we're looking for him, so...

01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:49.228
What's this?

01:04:49.297 --> 01:04:53.324
Oh, uh, Tom killed a guy
and we're burying the body.

01:04:53.401 --> 01:04:55.665
OK, that was bad.
- Aah!

01:04:55.736 --> 01:04:58.864
OK, well, now you're
overreacting. It's not...

01:05:08.616 --> 01:05:10.379
All right, all right, hey.

01:05:10.451 --> 01:05:15.980
Anybody moves, there's gonna be
a big hole where her brain used to be.

01:05:18.226 --> 01:05:21.457
Yeah. Go ahead, shoot.

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:24.489
Well, what are you waiting for?
Come on!

01:05:24.565 --> 01:05:25.827
What are you waiting for?!
Waste the bitch!

01:05:25.900 --> 01:05:27.868
Tom!
- No, I don't give a shit!

01:05:27.935 --> 01:05:31.564
Hey, I'm not joking, asshole.
- Yeah?

01:05:31.639 --> 01:05:35.370
Pull the trigger. Come on. Come on!

01:05:37.245 --> 01:05:40.976
I think you're just all talk.

01:05:44.619 --> 01:05:47.588
Looks like we both got guns.

01:05:49.123 --> 01:05:52.024
Who's gonna shoot first this time?

01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:02.362
Well, that should do it.

01:06:02.436 --> 01:06:05.405
Tom! You are so brave.

01:06:05.473 --> 01:06:08.704
No, no. It's not even that big of a deal.
This gun's not even loaded...

01:06:10.011 --> 01:06:11.945
What the hell is going on?

01:06:12.013 --> 01:06:15.449
I never should have doubted you.
You risked your life for me.

01:06:15.516 --> 01:06:18.349
Audrey found some bullets in
the kitchen and I may have reloaded it.

01:06:18.452 --> 01:06:20.443
Yeah, I did.

01:06:20.554 --> 01:06:24.752
Yo, excuse me. Does anyone here
know a Jack Taylor?

01:06:24.825 --> 01:06:26.156
Why?

01:06:26.227 --> 01:06:29.958
This dude just called, said if I don't pick
him up at the train station in 15 minutes,

01:06:30.031 --> 01:06:33.023
I'm out of a job. What do
you suppose that means?

01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:34.226
Oh, my God.

01:06:34.302 --> 01:06:36.270
That's what I thought,
'cause I ain't got no job.

01:06:36.337 --> 01:06:38.202
He's coming home early.
- OK, don't worry about it.

01:06:38.272 --> 01:06:41.366
I'll take care of everything, OK?
Trust me. Just don't drive too fast.

01:06:41.442 --> 01:06:42.773
Got it.

01:06:42.843 --> 01:06:45.403
And, um, maybe you
should put that away.

01:06:45.479 --> 01:06:48.915
Oh, God.

01:07:39.467 --> 01:07:42.903
I knew that was you.

01:09:08.488 --> 01:09:12.288
As long as we're in Thailand
for the meeting on Monday afternoon.

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:16.523
Yeah. We can pick it up
when we refuel in Hawaii.

01:09:17.163 --> 01:09:19.997
Hey, uh, do you wanna stop
and, uh, get something to drink,

01:09:20.067 --> 01:09:21.363
go to the bathroom or something?

01:09:21.435 --> 01:09:23.528
We'll take the departmental heads now

01:09:23.604 --> 01:09:26.937
and the Creative team
in a couple of weeks.

01:09:36.450 --> 01:09:38.509
That's the agenda up to lunch,
then there's lunch...

01:09:47.495 --> 01:09:51.261
OK. And then...

01:09:55.069 --> 01:09:58.368
OK. OK.

01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:02.138
OK, fine.

01:10:06.046 --> 01:10:10.881
Stansfield, what are you doing?
- Nothing, sir.

01:10:10.985 --> 01:10:13.715
Hold on a moment, please.

01:10:13.821 --> 01:10:18.690
Stansfield... why don't you
just concentrate on the driving

01:10:18.759 --> 01:10:21.694
and let me get on with making my call.

01:10:21.762 --> 01:10:24.424
Wait!
- What is it now, Stansfield?

01:10:24.498 --> 01:10:28.901
Oh, nothing, sir. Almost home.

01:10:47.054 --> 01:10:51.388
Hey. How'd this get in there?
- Oh, be careful with that.

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.323
I will. Good thing I found it.

01:10:53.394 --> 01:10:56.386
There's several ways to properly
dispose of a handgun,

01:10:56.463 --> 01:10:58.897
none of which include
putting it in a garbage bag.

01:10:58.966 --> 01:11:02.060
Freeze! Police! Freeze!

01:11:02.136 --> 01:11:04.070
Let go of the girl
and put your hands in the air!

01:11:04.138 --> 01:11:05.935
You're completely surrounded, TJ!

01:11:06.006 --> 01:11:08.531
Put down your weapons
and put your hands on you head!

01:11:08.609 --> 01:11:14.013
No, you guys. Wait. He's not TJ.
I'm Lisa Taylor. This is my dad's house.

01:11:14.081 --> 01:11:15.912
Ma'am, we've received
numerous reports

01:11:15.983 --> 01:11:17.416
from this neighborhood: theft, gunfire...

01:11:17.484 --> 01:11:21.716
All right. Look, I know you probably
think we may have killed somebody,

01:11:21.822 --> 01:11:23.551
but Tom didn't know
he poisoned the guy,

01:11:23.624 --> 01:11:27.560
and we thought he was dead when
we buried him. But he seems OK now.

01:11:27.661 --> 01:11:31.028
His head's just a little bloody
from where we hit him with the shovel.

01:11:31.098 --> 01:11:34.158
And I swear when Tom shot the gun off,
he didn't think it was loaded

01:11:34.235 --> 01:11:37.568
'cause I put the bullets back in,
so if you'll all just step inside,

01:11:37.638 --> 01:11:39.833
you'll see there's nobody dead here.

01:11:39.907 --> 01:11:41.841
He may have had the wind
knocked out of him temporarily,

01:11:41.909 --> 01:11:44.434
but with a little first aid,
I think he'll be just fine.

01:11:54.288 --> 01:11:56.313
Holy mother of God!

01:11:58.792 --> 01:12:00.157
Hans!

01:12:00.227 --> 01:12:02.457
Yes, I see. I see.

01:12:02.529 --> 01:12:04.554
OK, fine.

01:12:05.933 --> 01:12:08.493
Could you say that again?
You're breaking up!

01:12:08.569 --> 01:12:13.802
One moment, please. OJ!

01:12:23.050 --> 01:12:27.953
I just can't understand why you would
do this. Hans, what were you thinking?

01:12:28.022 --> 01:12:30.354
He'll be fine. He may complain
about a sore throat,

01:12:30.424 --> 01:12:33.018
but he's in a lot better shape
than this chandelier.

01:12:33.093 --> 01:12:34.560
Well, I'd hate to be here
when the owner gets back.

01:12:35.329 --> 01:12:37.456
You can say that again.

01:12:41.635 --> 01:12:42.966
Tom! Daddy!
- What do we got?

01:12:43.037 --> 01:12:45.232
What was that?
- Watch the glass, OK, everybody?

01:12:45.306 --> 01:12:47.331
Let's get'em out of the car.
- Oh, my God! Daddy!

01:12:47.408 --> 01:12:49.603
Everybody, stay back and remain calm.
- Are you all right?

01:12:49.677 --> 01:12:51.941
That's him. That's the one spying
on me through the bushes.

01:12:52.012 --> 01:12:54.173
He shot the bullet right through
my Julie's bedroom window.

01:12:54.248 --> 01:12:57.308
Here. Tell'em, Julie.

01:12:58.018 --> 01:13:00.714
You guys, Tom wants the body in here.

01:13:00.821 --> 01:13:03.289
Take it easy. Put me down.

01:13:04.692 --> 01:13:08.150
Stansfield, what have you done?

01:13:08.262 --> 01:13:11.823
Lisa, pack your things.
You're coming with me to Thailand.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.394
No!

01:13:18.806 --> 01:13:21.138
Get his ass out of here.

01:13:21.208 --> 01:13:25.235
It's funny you should mention
the word 'ass', Jack.

01:13:25.312 --> 01:13:28.338
Why don't we start
by talking about yours.

01:13:28.415 --> 01:13:29.347
Excuse me?

01:13:29.416 --> 01:13:33.477
Lisa, your father is not
who you think he is.

01:13:33.587 --> 01:13:38.286
The whole publishing operation.
It's a great cover.

01:13:38.359 --> 01:13:42.318
Now how'd you do it? What'd you do?
Did you hollow out the books?

01:13:42.396 --> 01:13:46.833
Oh, and locating the plant
in Thailand. It's genius!

01:13:48.102 --> 01:13:52.163
What are you talking about?
- What am I... Jack.

01:13:52.239 --> 01:13:56.972
You know, I-I would've believed
you, Jack... until I met this man,

01:13:57.044 --> 01:13:59.239
who seems to know a lot about ya.

01:14:01.115 --> 01:14:06.576
Recognize this? I hear it's very
effective in relieving folliculitis.

01:14:06.687 --> 01:14:09.781
I don't have folliculitis.

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:13.553
He's given me no choice.

01:14:13.627 --> 01:14:15.458
He's given me no choice!
- Tom, what are you doing?

01:14:15.529 --> 01:14:18.225
This is insane!
- Yeah? Take a look at your dad's ass.

01:14:18.298 --> 01:14:20.095
No!
- Then tell me I'm insane, huh?

01:14:20.167 --> 01:14:24.627
Huh? Look at it!

01:14:24.705 --> 01:14:27.299
Look at it! Huh? Huh?

01:14:27.374 --> 01:14:29.205
Ooh...
- What?

01:14:34.014 --> 01:14:36.005
Oh, that's nasty.

01:14:41.488 --> 01:14:46.926
I told you I don't have folliculitis,
you blithering idiot.

01:14:46.994 --> 01:14:52.728
Well, guys, the ointment
must have worked.

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.961
Let's go.

01:14:55.035 --> 01:14:59.335
Wait! I have something to show ya.

01:15:03.377 --> 01:15:04.605
What's with this movie
and the ass cheeks?

01:15:04.678 --> 01:15:09.980
My real name is Jack Taylor... Jr.
Red is my nickname.

01:15:10.050 --> 01:15:13.986
Now you know why.
I'm the whole reason that TJ's here.

01:15:14.054 --> 01:15:18.115
Goddamn it, Red. You've been
dealing drugs out of my house!

01:15:18.225 --> 01:15:22.252
No, Dad, I swear.
I gave this guy a bag of flour.

01:15:22.329 --> 01:15:25.662
I dumped a kilo of the real stuff
down the toilet.

01:15:25.732 --> 01:15:27.859
I'm finished dealing for good.

01:15:27.935 --> 01:15:31.029
The lime green toilet
with the wooden seat?

01:15:31.805 --> 01:15:34.205
Yeah, why?

01:15:46.854 --> 01:15:51.587
Wait a second. He's flying.

01:15:51.658 --> 01:15:54.525
He's flying.

01:16:14.114 --> 01:16:19.882
Get him out of my sight. Now.
Lisa, let's go.

01:16:22.122 --> 01:16:24.682
That's the one. He got my ear!
Evander Holyfield's ear.

01:16:24.791 --> 01:16:27.487
You have to right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and...

01:16:27.561 --> 01:16:29.358
Lisa, wait!

01:16:29.429 --> 01:16:32.091
That's Holyfield's ear
for God's sake.

01:16:52.619 --> 01:16:56.453
OJ?

01:16:58.025 --> 01:17:03.327
OJ! Come to Daddy.
How's my little boy?

01:17:16.677 --> 01:17:23.207
You're going with him?
- What choice do I have? He needs me.

01:17:23.283 --> 01:17:25.911
Are you actually feeling sorry for him?

01:17:26.019 --> 01:17:29.455
He's manipulating you
and you are buying it.

01:17:30.357 --> 01:17:34.259
All right, fine. You do what you gotta do.
I am gonna bail Tom out of jail.

01:17:34.328 --> 01:17:35.386
With what? Your drug money?

01:17:35.462 --> 01:17:37.487
No, no, no. I stole this out of Dad's safe.

01:17:37.564 --> 01:17:40.624
Look, the important thing is,
somebody has gotta help Tom.

01:17:40.701 --> 01:17:44.364
You know that nothing that happened
here last night was any of his fault.

01:17:44.438 --> 01:17:48.932
It's funny. The nicest guy in the world's
the only one with enough balls

01:17:49.009 --> 01:17:51.307
to stand up to Dad.

01:17:54.648 --> 01:17:58.880
All he wanted to do was
to spend some time with you.

01:17:58.986 --> 01:18:01.113
Look what it gets him.

01:18:01.221 --> 01:18:06.056
Classic Dad. I'm not allowed in the
house, you're not allowed out of it.

01:18:06.126 --> 01:18:09.562
He doesn't care about us.
Only that stupid bird.

01:18:10.964 --> 01:18:14.627
Hey, Red, can I tell you something?
- Sure.

01:18:14.701 --> 01:18:19.195
I know this is gonna sound weird,
but ever since I was a little kid...

01:18:21.408 --> 01:18:26.209
I used to always wish
that I was that stupid bird.

01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:39.882
Look, I think it's about time
you talk to Dad.

01:18:39.993 --> 01:18:43.759
At least tell him how you feel.
You can do it.

01:18:48.235 --> 01:18:51.966
Don't you see, we have no reason
to be afraid of him?

01:19:06.086 --> 01:19:10.887
Daddy!
- Lisa, don't let him do this to you.

01:19:35.649 --> 01:19:38.812
Lisa!
- Tom!

01:19:38.919 --> 01:19:42.616
Red bailed me out... and told me you
were here and I'm not letting you go.

01:19:42.756 --> 01:19:45.224
Yeah, but I'm...
- No. You're gonna let me finish.

01:19:45.325 --> 01:19:48.761
I went through hell last night and it was
my fault 'cause I let people do it to me.

01:19:48.862 --> 01:19:50.625
And now you're gonna
make the same mistake.

01:19:50.697 --> 01:19:52.392
Yeah, but...
- This isn't what you want.

01:19:52.466 --> 01:19:55.458
This is what your father wants.
And you know what?

01:19:55.535 --> 01:20:01.633
Maybe you and I... never
are gonna work. And that hurts.

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:05.906
But not as much as watching you
be controlled by a ruthless tyrant

01:20:05.979 --> 01:20:08.573
that would screw his own mother
if he thought it'd help him get ahead...

01:20:08.648 --> 01:20:20.048
Tom! I'm not going.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.219
She's-she's not going.

01:20:25.432 --> 01:20:29.334
Is this whole concept too complicated
for you, Stansfield?

01:20:39.613 --> 01:20:43.743
No. No.

01:20:43.817 --> 01:20:46.445
All right.

01:20:46.553 --> 01:20:49.852
Wha... I... What made you stay?

01:20:57.931 --> 01:20:59.922
That.

01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:12.770
How did you guys...
- We finally had our long overdue talk.

01:21:13.513 --> 01:21:16.448
Then-then who's taking
your place in Thailand?

01:21:16.516 --> 01:21:18.177
He is.

01:21:18.285 --> 01:21:19.547
What's this?
- Ow!

01:21:19.653 --> 01:21:22.884
I'm kidding.
- I don't wanna go. I'm afraid.

01:21:22.989 --> 01:21:26.015
Nonsense. Everyone knows that, uh...

01:21:26.126 --> 01:21:29.357
Asian people are very
intimidated by, uh...

01:21:29.429 --> 01:21:31.454
Tall men?
- Canadians?

01:21:31.531 --> 01:21:34.261
Republicans?
- Blacks?

01:21:34.334 --> 01:21:36.097
Henderson?
- Yes, sir.

01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:37.898
I won't have that kind of thinking
in this company.

01:21:37.971 --> 01:21:40.838
There's no room for racism here.
You're fired.

01:21:40.907 --> 01:21:45.640
Now, Tom, the point that I'm getting to
is that with a big part of the team away,

01:21:45.712 --> 01:21:48.476
I'm gonna want you to take over
the Creative Department.

01:21:48.548 --> 01:21:50.812
Me?
- No need to be modest.

01:21:50.917 --> 01:21:53.909
I saw those ideas you left
in the living room.

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:58.821
Your theory on the JFK thing, brilliant.
And the moon landing, a hoax?

01:21:58.892 --> 01:22:00.985
You're really on to something there.

01:22:01.061 --> 01:22:05.088
That's the kind of thinking
that's gonna sell books.

01:22:05.165 --> 01:22:09.101
Uh, thank you, sir.

01:22:09.169 --> 01:22:12.798
Bye, Daddy. Have a safe flight.

01:22:16.209 --> 01:22:20.771
Well, Dad... that's fantastic.
You promoted Tom.

01:22:20.847 --> 01:22:24.374
Yeah, well, I figure anyone who's got
the guts to piss on my Persian carpet

01:22:24.484 --> 01:22:29.217
has gotta have what it takes.
Stansfield!

01:22:34.661 --> 01:22:39.928
What the hell are you doing?
- Just trying to get my job back, sir.

01:22:44.971 --> 01:22:48.907
You know, after everything
that happened, after all I went through,

01:22:48.975 --> 01:22:52.911
I guess it was my lucky day.
And I'm not the only one.

01:22:52.979 --> 01:22:55.004
Based on Lisa and Red's suggestions,

01:22:55.081 --> 01:22:57.675
Jack restructured the company
from top to bottom.

01:22:57.751 --> 01:23:01.414
Even instituting casual
Fridays every day.

01:23:01.521 --> 01:23:04.718
And last Friday was Henderson's
27th straight day on the job

01:23:04.791 --> 01:23:06.281
without being fired.

01:23:06.393 --> 01:23:09.385
OJ's back off the drugs
and now he only drinks beer.

01:23:11.498 --> 01:23:14.160
But he still has
an occasional flashback.

01:23:16.836 --> 01:23:19.304
Jack begged Audrey to come back,
but she got a job

01:23:19.372 --> 01:23:21.363
at, of all places, a coffee shop.

01:23:27.647 --> 01:23:30.377
This is terrible!

01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:34.045
Hans succeeded in turning around
the company's factory in Thailand.

01:23:34.154 --> 01:23:36.622
But apparently he's still struggling
to cope with the local customs.

01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:39.090
Back of bus!
- Excuse me?

01:23:39.159 --> 01:23:42.526
You people belong back of bus.
- That's an outrage!

01:23:42.595 --> 01:23:45.462
Man, I'm not gonna let you treat me
like that merely because I'm...

01:23:45.532 --> 01:23:48.399
Smoking! Smokers belong back of bus!

01:23:51.538 --> 01:23:53.733
As for me, with my new promotion,

01:23:53.807 --> 01:23:56.799
I could at last write books
based on my own experiences.

01:23:56.876 --> 01:23:58.275
So I did.
- Thank you.

01:23:58.345 --> 01:24:02.145
And Lisa was finally able to pursue
a career that she loved.

01:24:02.215 --> 01:24:05.048
You know, you ever heard
someone say that old expression:

01:24:05.151 --> 01:24:08.348
'Why does everything bad
always happen to me?'

01:24:08.455 --> 01:24:12.391
Well, I don't get those people...
'cause I've learned that if they just stop

01:24:12.492 --> 01:24:19.227
and look around, they'd realize
that everything happens for a reason.
