00:08.217 --> 00:10.344
Dad, what did you do?

00:10.427 --> 00:12.471
-I--
-Hey.

00:13.305 --> 00:16.433
Around about the early midpoint
of this first season,

00:16.517 --> 00:20.395
we begin to see the first hints
that there is more to Margot

00:20.479 --> 00:21.939
than meets the eye.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.274
She's not a passenger in this story.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.903
What did you tell Chuy about us?

00:27.986 --> 00:31.782
Mosquito Coast came to me, and
I just kept the script by my bedside

00:31.865 --> 00:33.951
and read it over the months.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.119
And never did a casting,
because I was afraid

00:36.203 --> 00:39.414
that I loved it too much
that I didn't wanna lose the part.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.834
So, here's what's gonna happen.

00:41.917 --> 00:44.253
Margot's got this killer streak in her.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.713
And what I wanted to show
in episode four, especially,

00:46.797 --> 00:49.550
is that you can see
that when things are bad,

00:49.633 --> 00:50.759
she's like an assassin.

00:50.843 --> 00:53.387
A very elegant, silent one.

00:54.429 --> 00:57.349
I've always considered her
the patriarch of the family.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.726
She's the one who's probably
the most level,

00:59.810 --> 01:03.397
the most thoughtful and also
the most empathetic with the children.

01:03.480 --> 01:08.151
I'm a mom, always thinking about the worst
thing that could possibly happen to them.

01:08.819 --> 01:12.906
Allie is sort of this
slightly hyperactive, bouncy child.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.201
He's incredibly facile
at manipulating people

01:16.285 --> 01:18.704
as he's looking them in the eye
and being dead honest with them.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.831
Hey, told you it was gonna be
an adventure.

01:21.623 --> 01:26.712
Allie exemplifies an element
of the American dream,

01:26.795 --> 01:31.300
wherein that hurricane of optimism
and forward movement

01:31.383 --> 01:36.180
becomes a kind of blindness
to the needs of what might be around.

01:36.263 --> 01:39.766
He's always thinking that the grass
is greener, because to him it is.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.144
And he constantly searches
for that part of life.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.979
In episode four,

01:44.062 --> 01:48.650
Allie's confronted with some truths
about himself and is humiliated.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.320
Which is an element
Justin didn't only accept,

01:51.403 --> 01:52.654
but celebrated and pushed.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.073
You wanna run away from America,
but you can't.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.825
The way you think you can buy people.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.785
The way you think
you can buy anything you want.

01:58.869 --> 01:59.828
You are America.

01:59.912 --> 02:02.956
He's got this very
American pioneer spirit of,

02:03.040 --> 02:04.291
"We're just gonna set off,

02:04.374 --> 02:07.711
and we're gonna find
our Shangri-la elsewhere."

02:07.794 --> 02:12.174
There's a tension
between optimism and theft

02:12.257 --> 02:16.053
in this constant need always
to look at the next valley.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.932
There's always the next place to go.
It's always gonna be better.
