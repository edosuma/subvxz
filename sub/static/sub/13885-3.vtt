00:46.360 --> 00:48.351
How are you feeling, Mr Lister?

00:48.520 --> 00:51.318
Oh, much better, thanks, Kryten.

00:52.360 --> 00:57.673
- Much, much better.
- Well, you certainly look far better.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.116
I can't believe how much
the swelling's gone down overnight.

01:01.320 --> 01:03.311
- Do you reckon?
- Definitely.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.552
It was interfering
with the ceiling fan yesterday afternoon.

01:06.720 --> 01:10.838
You're nearly your old self.
You can hardly tell you've got space mumps.

01:11.040 --> 01:15.591
- When can I have a mirror?
- I don't think we're quite ready yet, sir.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.633
Let's take it one step at a time.

01:19.200 --> 01:24.911
Oh, what did I tell you? It's gone down
eight inches overnight. You'll be up in no time.

01:25.080 --> 01:30.473
I don't know what I'd have done without you.
You're like Florence Nightingdroid.

01:31.640 --> 01:37.317
- Did you bring my breakfast?
- Yes, sir. Hot lager with croutons.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.638
You certainly find out who your mates are
when you've got an unsightly ailment.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.389
- I wouldn't say unsightly, sir.
- Get outta town, Kryten.

01:45.560 --> 01:49.075
My head's like a hot-air balloon.
I'm a human light bulb.

01:49.240 --> 01:55.031
And how many times have they dropped by
with a word of comfort or a bunch of grapes?

01:55.240 --> 01:58.471
It's not been possible.
Mr Rimmer has been on vacation.

01:58.640 --> 02:02.428
Vacation? The world's most charismatic man?
Where did he go?

02:02.600 --> 02:05.068
On a rambling holiday through the diesel decks.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.239
A ten-day hike through the ship's engines
with two of the skutters.

02:09.400 --> 02:13.154
- He said he'd pop by to show you the slides.
- He didn't?

02:13.360 --> 02:16.989
He's been loading the projection carousel
for 24 hours now.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.191
You've got to stop him!

02:19.360 --> 02:23.433
A slide show of the diesel decks -
that could finish me off.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.750
But I thought the Cat would drop in.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.713
Well, he's been preoccupied
with this pod business.

02:29.800 --> 02:34.430
Oh, screw down my diodes!
I wasn't supposed to mention that.

02:34.640 --> 02:38.918
- What pod?
- You're not well. Forget I mentioned it.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.792
Come on, Kryten. What pod?

02:41.000 --> 02:45.391
Yesterday evening, we came across
an escape pod floating in the local asteroid belt.

02:45.560 --> 02:49.314
It contains the survivor of some space crash,
apparently cryogenically frozen.

02:49.520 --> 02:53.911
- Oh, yeah?
- She's in a suitable condition for revival.

02:54.120 --> 02:57.908
- She?
- As far as we can tell, she's a she.

02:58.080 --> 03:01.197
That's just great, isn't it? That's just typical.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.960
The first female company in three million years,

03:04.120 --> 03:07.112
and I look like I belong up a whale's nose.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.392
- Smeg!
- You can't get up, sir! What are you doing?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.716
What do you think I'm doing?

03:12.880 --> 03:15.110
I'm on the cop.

03:16.880 --> 03:20.509
- Who is she, Hol?
- It says on the pod Barbra Bellini.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.638
Barbra Bellini. What a beautiful name.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.634
There's no justice. How could this happen to me?

03:27.840 --> 03:30.638
I could wear a turban and pretend I'm from India.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.593
You could wear a spike
and pretend you're the Taj Mahal.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.236
Oh, it's you.
Well, thanks for visiting me. Thanks a lot.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.750
You know what you look like? It's nauseating.

03:40.920 --> 03:45.038
You could double-date with the Elephant Man
and he would be the looker.

03:46.400 --> 03:50.154
Why isn't it activated?
No one's started the thaw process.

03:50.360 --> 03:54.239
- I thought Alphabet-Head did it.
- So, where's she from?

03:54.440 --> 03:57.398
Who cares? At last... a date.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.115
- Who says she'll be interested in you?
- I get it.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.078
All this time alone has driven her insane.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.716
No. Say she just doesn't go for your type?

04:07.920 --> 04:10.957
I'd have seen her in "Ripley's Believe It Or Not".

04:11.160 --> 04:13.879
- Say she's interested in somebody else?
- Like who?

04:14.120 --> 04:18.033
I dunno. Like... Like me?

04:18.240 --> 04:21.072
Your head's like a watermelon.
What you gonna do?

04:21.240 --> 04:25.153
Paint it yellow and black
and say you play with the Bengals?

04:25.320 --> 04:29.279
You're a bit cocky for a guy
who's never met a woman before.

04:29.480 --> 04:35.112
I've seen mirrors. I have eyes.
Face it, buddy, my body makes men wet.

04:37.120 --> 04:42.752
Have you ever heard of the Iranian jerd?
It can do 150 pelvic thrusts a second.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.790
- So?
- That's me in slo-mo.

04:45.960 --> 04:50.795
Put a Black & Decker drill on the end,
I can make it through walls, boy!

04:53.400 --> 04:55.470
Listy, what are you doing up?

04:55.680 --> 04:59.389
Shouldn't you be in the greenhouse
with the rest of the cantaloupes?

04:59.600 --> 05:02.637
- Who started the RP?
- He did.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.872
You simple-minded gimboid.
I said to leave this to me.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.594
Look, she's in there. Let's get her out.

05:08.800 --> 05:14.158
The problem, Pussycat Willum,
is this capsule was ejected from a prison ship

05:14.320 --> 05:16.754
on which the convicts mutinied.

05:16.920 --> 05:22.790
There was a battle with only two survivors:
one prisoner, one guard - Ms Bellini.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.633
One of those two got in this pod and escaped.

05:25.800 --> 05:30.237
But, of course, you'll know this,
having studied the black box recording.

05:30.440 --> 05:34.877
- If it's not Bellini in there, who is it?
- One of the prisoners.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.953
And considering
that ship was transporting 40 psychotic,

05:39.120 --> 05:41.839
mass-murdering, super-strong androids,

05:42.000 --> 05:44.912
we thought we'd see who was in there first.

05:45.120 --> 05:47.315
With respect, sir, they're not androids.

05:47.480 --> 05:49.755
- They're simulants.
- What's the difference?

05:49.920 --> 05:54.994
An android would never rip off a human's head
and spit down his neck.

05:55.200 --> 06:01.070
- Can we stop it, Hol?
- What? Oh, no. One-way process.

06:01.240 --> 06:07.634
- Can't we X-ray the pod?
- No. Lead lining. Has to survive in space.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.196
- There must be some way of finding out.
- There is.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.999
Just hang around here for 24 hours.

06:14.160 --> 06:19.917
Then, if you find your limbs scattered
around deep space, it probably wasn't Babs.

06:21.440 --> 06:24.876
Why not tool up with bazookoids,
wait for the pod to open,

06:25.040 --> 06:28.669
and if it's some bad-ass android dude,
let it eat laser?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.916
Simulants are almost indestructible, sir.

06:31.080 --> 06:35.551
It could withstand bazookoid fire at close range
with only minimal damage.

06:35.720 --> 06:39.599
It would be able to make balloon animals
out of your intestines.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.076
I see no other option.
Let's blast it back into space.

06:43.280 --> 06:49.549
Hang on! Say it isn't the simulant?
You can't shoot an innocent woman into space.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.316
What a dilemma!
Inside this pod is either death or a date.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.315
Personally, I'm prepared to take the risk.

06:57.520 --> 07:03.038
Meanwhile, the pod is defrosting, and
we haven't decided what to do. Holly, any ideas?

07:03.240 --> 07:08.758
Right. The black box contains the coordinates
of the penal colony the ship was heading for.

07:08.920 --> 07:11.593
- So?
- There's bound to be facilities there

07:11.760 --> 07:13.796
to contain any hostile life form.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.394
If it's Bellini, we release her.

07:16.560 --> 07:19.632
If it's the simulant, we leave him to rot.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.150
If the colony's still there and still operational.

07:23.360 --> 07:27.911
There's an old android saying
which has particular relevance here.

07:28.080 --> 07:31.834
"If you don't gosub a program loop,
you'll never get a subroutine. "

07:32.040 --> 07:35.555
We have a saying that's similar:
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained. "

07:35.760 --> 07:38.593
I think the android one is punchier.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.230
- Do you have to sit here?
- It's warmer. It helps my gunge.

07:46.400 --> 07:49.392
Your head's getting in the way of the mirror.

07:49.560 --> 07:52.677
In fact, it's getting in the way of the windscreen.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.831
Next! Ah, now, this one...

07:55.000 --> 07:57.798
We reached this beauty on the fourth day.

07:57.960 --> 08:02.715
The Cameron Mackintosh
40-valve air-cooled diesel. The 184.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.350
Almost identical to the 179,
but have you noticed the difference?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.670
See the refinement in the funnel edges?

08:12.000 --> 08:16.790
We'd never get another chance to see it,
so we bivouacked down for the night.

08:16.960 --> 08:19.349
There's a funny story about that,

08:19.520 --> 08:24.036
but we won't get to the class fives
unless we push along. Next!

08:24.200 --> 08:27.909
- Ah! Another favourite.
- Sir, can we take a break?

08:28.080 --> 08:30.992
My intelligence circuits have melted.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.313
We won't get through them all if we do.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.432
That's a gamble I'm willing to take.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.909
Now, the class 40s, the first twin...

08:45.480 --> 08:48.040
Oh, my God!

08:48.520 --> 08:51.398
His head burst!

08:54.640 --> 08:58.349
That's better. That is so much better. I feel good!

08:58.560 --> 09:01.233
Talk about a weight off your mind.

09:02.280 --> 09:07.070
I don't want to live!
Someone, please... shoot me in the head!

09:10.200 --> 09:14.432
- Anything down there, Hol?
- No life forms according to the heat scan.

09:14.600 --> 09:18.434
- Any mechanical intelligence?
- Yes, the mainframe's still operational.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.512
Just initiating interface...
Hang about. Here we go.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.750
Getting a message.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.911
Welcome to Justice World,

09:26.120 --> 09:29.078
Please state your clearance code
and prison officer ident,

09:29.280 --> 09:33.068
We're not a prison ship.
We just want to use your facilities.

09:33.280 --> 09:35.953
- State life form inventory,
- Four.

09:36.120 --> 09:38.475
One hologram, one mechanoid, two humanoid.

09:38.680 --> 09:43.117
- Transfer ship navicomp to my jurisdiction,
- OK, guys.

09:43.960 --> 09:48.476
On landing, proceed through the neutral area
to the clearance zone,

09:57.640 --> 10:03.078
Until you are granted a clearance code,
please observe all security requirements,

10:03.240 --> 10:07.119
Your party will be met
by a consignment of escort boots,

10:09.960 --> 10:13.111
Please step into the boots,

10:18.240 --> 10:22.472
I'm supposed to wear these?!
These look li ke Frankenstein's hand-me-downs.

10:22.640 --> 10:26.235
Haven't you got anything
with a Cuban heel or crepe sole?

10:26.440 --> 10:31.355
- I can't wear these. I'm a hologram.
- That has been accounted for,

10:34.720 --> 10:36.233
Now what?

10:46.880 --> 10:51.749
- Oh, God! What's this?
- Relax, sir. It's just a mind probe.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.516
- What's a mind probe?
- The computer was searching our minds,

10:59.680 --> 11:02.240
presumably for any evidence of criminal activity.

11:03.760 --> 11:06.228
What do you mean, "criminal activity"?

11:06.440 --> 11:09.273
Don't worry.
It's just a routine clearance procedure.

11:09.480 --> 11:12.916
Yeah, but when you say "criminal activity",
what do you mean?

11:13.120 --> 11:16.430
- How criminal is "criminal"?
- What are you bleating on about?

11:16.640 --> 11:19.393
Just define "criminal activity" for me.

11:19.600 --> 11:23.309
If someone had committed a crime
and concealed it from the law,

11:23.680 --> 11:27.673
the mind probe could uncover that crime
and sentence that person accordingly.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.519
Why did no one tell me this?

11:30.720 --> 11:35.555
Oh, Listy, Listy. Is that a small sewage plant
you're carrying in your trousers...

11:36.960 --> 11:39.076
.. or are you a tad concerned?

11:39.280 --> 11:43.319
Well, come on, guys.
Everyone's done something that's a little bit illegal.

11:43.520 --> 11:46.830
- I haven't. Not even a parking ticket.
- Oh, smeggin' hell!

11:47.040 --> 11:49.076
- What did you do?
- Well, scrumping.

11:49.240 --> 11:53.870
- When I was a kid, we always went scrumping.
- Stealing apples? That's hardly a crime.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.039
Yeah, but me and me mates,
we went scrumping for cars.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.470
- Did you get caught?
- All the time.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.989
Well, then, you've served your punishment.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.879
There were things that I didn't get caught for.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.799
- Like what?
- One time at this hotel...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.116
Lots of people take towels from hotels.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.117
I took the bed.

12:13.280 --> 12:17.512
Winched it out the window.
I was renting this flat. It was unfurnished.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.315
- You went to a hotel and stole the bed?!
- Stole the entire room.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.034
Absolutely despicable. You're a common thief.

12:24.240 --> 12:29.234
I'm not making excuses, but everyone
was doing it. I couldn't go against the flow.

12:29.440 --> 12:33.752
- I would not like to be in your boots.
- What's going to happen to me?

12:33.960 --> 12:38.078
Don't worry, sir. I'm sure they're
not interested in some minor misdemeanour

12:38.240 --> 12:40.993
you committed over three million years ago.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.352
- Seriously, you reckon?
- Boy, I'm really getting the hang of lying.

12:45.520 --> 12:47.511
That was totally convincing, wasn't it?

12:51.440 --> 12:54.477
The mechanoid Kryten - clearance granted,

12:54.640 --> 12:56.870
You may go freely about the complex,

13:04.800 --> 13:08.315
The creature known as Cat - clearance granted,

13:08.520 --> 13:11.034
Oooooooooooowwww!

13:11.200 --> 13:14.192
Hey, I hear they do good bread and water here.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.634
The human known as Lister -
despite a number of petty criminal acts -

13:20.840 --> 13:22.990
clearance granted,

13:29.560 --> 13:31.790
The hologram known as Rimmer -

13:32.520 --> 13:39.278
guilty of second-degree murder, 1,167 counts,

13:40.520 --> 13:42.590
No. There's some mistake, surely?

13:42.760 --> 13:48.153
Each count carries a statutory penalty
of eight years' penal servitude,

13:48.320 --> 13:50.675
In the light of your hologrammatic status,

13:50.840 --> 13:53.354
these sentences are to be served consecutively,

13:53.520 --> 13:59.755
making a total sentence of 9,328 years,

14:00.880 --> 14:04.839
I've never even returned a li brary book late.
Second-degree murder?

14:05.000 --> 14:08.356
1,000 people? I would have remembered!

14:08.520 --> 14:13.196
Your wilful negligence
in failing to reseal a drive plate

14:13.360 --> 14:15.828
resulted in the deaths of the entire crew

14:16.040 --> 14:20.716
of the Jupiter Mining Corporation vessel
the Red Dwarf,

14:20.880 --> 14:22.871
Oh, that.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.913
Sentence to commence immediately,

14:28.920 --> 14:33.630
You are now leaving the neutral area
and entering the Justice Zone,

14:33.800 --> 14:38.351
Beyond this point,
it is impossible to commit any act of injustice.

14:38.520 --> 14:39.839
Help!

14:45.160 --> 14:46.991
Hi, killer.

14:47.160 --> 14:52.075
- Nine thousand years. Nine!
- I brought you a book.

14:52.800 --> 14:56.156
Oh, thanks. That'll help the centuries fly past.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.590
Don't panic. We'll get you out of here.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.633
I'll be up for parole in a few ice ages.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.310
Kryten's appealing. He's putting a case together.

15:05.480 --> 15:09.837
This isn't a bad prison.
How come there are no locks or guards?

15:10.040 --> 15:15.273
There doesn't need to be. The whole prison is
covered by something called the Justice Field.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.795
I had to sit through this lecture.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.350
Apparently, it's physically impossible
to commit any sort of crime here.

15:21.560 --> 15:24.199
- What do you mean?
- Try. You'll see.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.235
- Like what?
- I don't know. Anything.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.516
Arson. Set fire to those sheets.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.874
- OK.
- Go on. Try it.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.909
Whatever crime you try and commit,
the consequences happen to you.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.836
Smeggin' hell!

15:46.400 --> 15:49.870
Nice example, Rimmer! Nice example!

15:50.040 --> 15:52.508
You could have explained that to me verbally.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.715
Same with stealing. Same with everything.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.919
Right. So if you nick something,
something of yours goes missing?

16:00.120 --> 16:02.111
Right. Try it.

16:04.680 --> 16:07.672
- No.
- You see? It's the perfect system.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.753
It forces inmates to obey the law.
Once they're out, it's second nature.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.032
Good news.
The justice computer has sanctioned a retrial.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.879
I think we have a very strong case.

16:18.080 --> 16:22.676
You do? It's a question of differentiating
between guilt and culpability, sir.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.435
The mind probe detected
your own sense of guilt about the accident.

16:26.640 --> 16:29.108
In a way, you tried and convicted yourself.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.512
I simply have to establish you're
a neurotic, under-achieving emotional retard

16:33.720 --> 16:37.474
whose ambition far outstrips his miniscule ability

16:37.640 --> 16:39.756
and consequently blames himself for an accident

16:39.920 --> 16:42.229
for which he couldn't have been responsible.

16:42.440 --> 16:47.150
You're going to prove that I was innocent
on the grounds that I'm a halfwit?

16:47.360 --> 16:51.638
Man, there ain't a jury in the land
that won't buy that.

16:52.360 --> 16:55.875
Not a halfwit, exactly... more a buffoon.

16:56.080 --> 16:59.311
How would you build a case?
Where would you find evidence?

16:59.520 --> 17:03.115
Sir, providing I have free access
to your data files,

17:03.280 --> 17:06.589
I think I can come up with
a winning case by... lunchtime.

17:09.240 --> 17:12.198
The mind probe
was created to detect guilt,

17:12.400 --> 17:15.756
yet in the case of Arnold Judas Rimmer,

17:16.760 --> 17:20.877
the guilt it detected attaches to no crime.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.396
He held a position of little importance
on Red Dwarf.

17:24.599 --> 17:28.559
He was a lowly grease monkey, a zero, a nothing,

17:28.760 --> 17:31.911
a piece of sputum in the toilet bowl of life.

17:32.480 --> 17:35.995
Yet he never came to terms
with a lifetime of underachievement.

17:36.200 --> 17:39.476
His absurdly inflated ego would never permit it.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.598
He's like the security guard on the front gate

17:42.760 --> 17:45.228
who considers himself head of the corporation.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.830
So when the crew were wiped out
by a nuclear accident,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.468
Arnold Rimmer accepted the blame.

17:51.640 --> 17:55.030
It was his ship, ergo his fault.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.152
I ask the court - look at this man,

17:58.320 --> 18:04.395
this man who sat and failed
his astronavigation exam on 13 occasions.

18:05.520 --> 18:09.195
This sad man, this pathetic man,
this joke of a man...

18:09.360 --> 18:11.669
Kryten. You're going over the top.

18:11.880 --> 18:15.395
Trust me. My whole case
hinges on proving you're a dork.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.239
Understood.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.874
I call my first witness.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.510
- Name?
- Dave Lister.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.756
Occupation?

18:34.240 --> 18:35.878
Bum.

18:36.080 --> 18:38.799
Would you describe the accused as a friend?

18:39.000 --> 18:41.992
- Take the Fifth!
- Please answer the question.

18:42.160 --> 18:46.756
You are under polygraphic surveillance.
Would you describe the accused as a friend?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.428
No, I'd describe the accused as a git.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.638
Who, then, thinks of him most fondly?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.592
I do.

18:55.800 --> 18:58.553
Have no others
shared moments of intimacy with him?

18:58.760 --> 19:01.354
Only one, but she's got a puncture.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.639
Objection!

19:04.480 --> 19:09.235
- Overruled,
- So he's not a man with a good social life?

19:09.440 --> 19:14.195
No. He partied less than Rudolf Hess.
He was totally dedicated to his career.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.319
He was in charge of Z shift.
It occupied his every waking moment.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.353
And what was Z shift's most important duty?

19:21.520 --> 19:25.991
Well, we had a lot of duties,
but I suppose our most vital responsibility

19:26.160 --> 19:30.392
was making sure the vending machines
didn't run out of fun-size Crunchie bars.

19:30.560 --> 19:35.953
Can you envisage a situation where
the lack of honeycomb-centred chocolate bars

19:36.120 --> 19:39.829
might be the direct cause
of a lethal radiation leak?

19:40.800 --> 19:42.995
Not off the top of my head.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.030
You may sit down.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.597
I ask the court one key question -

19:49.760 --> 19:54.754
would the Space Corps
have allowed this man to be in a position

19:54.920 --> 19:57.514
where he might endanger the entire crew?

19:57.680 --> 20:03.596
A man so petty and small-minded, he would
while away his evenings sewing name labels

20:03.760 --> 20:06.718
onto his ship-issue condoms.

20:07.960 --> 20:10.997
- A man of such awesome stupidity...
- Objection!

20:11.200 --> 20:14.829
- Objection overruled,
- A man of such awesome stupidity,

20:15.000 --> 20:18.356
he even objects to his own defence counsel.

20:18.520 --> 20:21.159
An over-zealous, trumped up little squirt...

20:21.320 --> 20:23.311
- Objection!
- Overruled,

20:23.520 --> 20:27.229
An incompetent vending machine repairman
with a Napoleon complex

20:27.400 --> 20:32.428
who commanded as much respect and affection
from shipmates as Long John Silver's parrot.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.919
Objection!

20:34.120 --> 20:39.558
If you object to your own counsel once more,
Mr Rimmer, you'll be in contempt,

20:39.760 --> 20:45.756
Who would let this man, this joke of a man,
a man who couldn't outwit a used tea bag,

20:45.920 --> 20:49.435
be in a position
where he might endanger the entire crew?

20:49.600 --> 20:52.512
Who? Only a yogurt.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.473
This man is not guilty of manslaughter.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.189
He is only guilty of being Arnold J Rimmer.

21:00.800 --> 21:05.191
That is his crime. It is also his punishment.

21:06.600 --> 21:08.909
The defence rests.

21:09.080 --> 21:13.517
The verdict will now be passed,
In view of your counsel's eloquent defence,

21:13.720 --> 21:17.315
together with the reams
of material evidence submitted,

21:17.480 --> 21:20.233
this court accepts that, in your case,

21:20.400 --> 21:24.359
the mind probe is not an adequate method
of ascertaining guilt,

21:24.560 --> 21:29.031
It is not possible
for you to have committed those crimes,

21:29.200 --> 21:31.634
and you may therefore go free,

21:31.800 --> 21:35.031
- Objection!
- Sir, what are you objecting to now?

21:35.200 --> 21:36.918
I want an apology.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.673
Brilliant, Kryten!
What can I say? You were brilliant.

21:43.840 --> 21:48.868
You even had me believing it.
The way you twisted the facts to fit this pattern.

21:49.080 --> 21:53.073
Let's go. I don't know why
we came to this hellhole in the first place.

21:53.280 --> 21:56.829
- I do.
- Hmm... Can I smell perfume?

21:57.040 --> 22:01.795
- I doubt it.
- Are you by any chance Barbra Bellini?

22:01.960 --> 22:03.951
I didn't think so!

22:06.920 --> 22:08.990
What's going on?!

22:11.640 --> 22:14.473
To think I caressed his pod!

22:33.840 --> 22:36.274
You are now entering the Justice Zone,

22:36.440 --> 22:41.355
Beyond this point,
it is impossible to commit any act of injustice.

22:42.760 --> 22:45.069
You are now entering the Justice Zone,

22:45.240 --> 22:49.756
Beyond this point,
it is impossible to commit any act of injustice.

23:17.880 --> 23:23.079
Hey, my friends... I don't want any trouble.

23:23.920 --> 23:28.596
I just want your spacecraft.
Give me the start-up code.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.557
Look. I have no weapon.

23:33.040 --> 23:36.157
What are you waiting for? Gloop him.

23:36.320 --> 23:38.788
I can't. He's not armed.

23:39.040 --> 23:43.591
Lister, this is not a Scout meeting. Gloop him.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.269
- What? In the back?
- Of course.

23:48.440 --> 23:50.510
It's only a pity he's awake.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.958
You could kill him if he was asleep?

23:54.120 --> 23:58.398
I could kill him if he was on the job. Gloop him.

23:59.360 --> 24:01.157
It's immoral.

24:01.320 --> 24:06.952
Come on, my friends.
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed droid.

24:07.120 --> 24:10.476
Come out and let's discuss it.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.511
I'm going to talk to him.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.593
You wanna talk? Let's talk.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.278
- You have no weapons?
- No.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.998
You have no weapon?

24:34.160 --> 24:35.832
No.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.830
Guess what.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.953
I lied.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.111
Guess what.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.519
So did I.

24:51.720 --> 24:56.077
But I lied... twice.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.319
- I didn't think of that.
- I'm glad you didn't.

25:01.520 --> 25:05.274
- What do you want to talk about?
- Your death.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.398
Your imminent death.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.995
What the smeg is going on?!

25:47.760 --> 25:53.153
- Yo, matey. Hit me on the head with this.
- Malfunction. Does not compute.

25:54.200 --> 25:59.638
Mal... function. Mal... function.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.149
I got him, buddy! Leave this to me!

26:19.320 --> 26:21.072
Cat, no! No!

26:21.240 --> 26:23.231
Better late than never.

26:38.840 --> 26:43.550
Makes you think. Mankind's history
has been one long search for justice.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.838
That's what all religions are about.
They accept life as being basically unfair,

26:48.000 --> 26:52.869
but promise everyone will get their just deserts -
heaven, hell, karma, whatever.

26:53.040 --> 26:58.160
That penal colony tried to bring some order
to the universe with the Justice Field,

26:58.320 --> 27:02.199
but in an environment where justice does exist,
you have no free will.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.874
That's why there can never be true justice.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.919
Good things happen to bad people
and bad things happen to good people.

27:09.080 --> 27:11.355
Life has to be cruel, unkind

27:11.520 --> 27:13.317
and unfaaaaaair...!

27:15.480 --> 27:17.835
Thank God for that.

27:21.720 --> 27:25.030
# It's cold outside, there's no kind of atmosphere

27:25.200 --> 27:28.476
# I'm all alone, more or less

27:28.640 --> 27:31.757
# Let me fly far away from here

27:31.920 --> 27:34.593
# Fun, fun, fun

27:34.760 --> 27:38.275
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:38.440 --> 27:41.671
# I want to lie shipwrecked and comatose

27:41.840 --> 27:44.991
# Drinking fresh mango juice

27:45.160 --> 27:48.391
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

27:48.560 --> 27:51.199
# Fun, fun, fun

27:51.360 --> 27:54.909
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:55.080 --> 27:57.799
# Fun, fun, fun

27:57.960 --> 28:00.349
# In the sun, sun, sun #
