WEBVTT

00:01.476 --> 00:02.596
If anyone knows anything

00:02.822 --> 00:03.942
about the Hudson sperm bank

00:04.193 --> 00:07.693
that went up in flames
in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, in 1981

00:07.793 --> 00:08.700
please help me.

00:09.008 --> 00:10.681
I love being a father once a week,

00:10.772 --> 00:12.177
but it is so draining.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.233
My new dad! Huh?

00:14.414 --> 00:16.389
That's what I liked when I was young.

00:16.478 --> 00:18.077
To feel a man's weight.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.767
A lot of women today,
they don't appreciate heft.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.645
You're cheating on me with <i>him</i> ?!

00:22.873 --> 00:23.694
Who is that?!

00:23.754 --> 00:26.812
Mr. Cavett! I was just
trying to bring down the curtain!

00:26.986 --> 00:28.284
<i>This is a monstrous place.</i>

"We Could Sing a Duet"

01:37.706 --> 01:41.091
I think I was aiming so well
because Emily's making me

01:41.091 --> 01:43.566
go on a date tonight with Bernard,
and I don't wanna go.

01:43.933 --> 01:46.508
Well, you don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do! Okay?

01:46.525 --> 01:48.703
Just wear two pairs of underwear
and that'll slow 'em down.

01:49.837 --> 01:52.479
No, I can handle Bernard,
that's not the problem.

01:53.628 --> 01:56.334
It's their relationship
that's eating at me.

01:57.138 --> 02:00.263
I need the two of you to sabotage their engagement.

02:00.279 --> 02:01.107
Sabotage?

02:01.107 --> 02:04.232
I know, that's strong language,
but things have gotten worse!

02:04.232 --> 02:06.176
They're talking about having children now!

02:06.426 --> 02:09.457
She told me that her eg—
that her eggs are like plums!

02:09.457 --> 02:10.257
Very ripe!

02:10.257 --> 02:11.769
Really? Plums?

02:11.776 --> 02:15.918
Yes! But the truth is, she's still
maturing, and he's half dead!

02:15.917 --> 02:18.204
You know, I have to save
her from herself somehow.

02:18.204 --> 02:20.608
We g—we gotta get Bernard
out of the picture.

02:21.328 --> 02:22.867
We could bring him here.

02:23.641 --> 02:24.438
We could accidentally shoot him.

02:24.438 --> 02:26.266
I'm such a bad shot we could
probably get away with it.

02:28.851 --> 02:30.825
No. No. Look. Here. Here's what we do.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.273
Take her out tonight, show her a- a—
a... youthful time.

02:34.273 --> 02:36.655
Show her what she'll be missing
by marrying some old fart.

02:36.678 --> 02:37.495
We can do that.

02:37.495 --> 02:39.661
I can't.
I finally became unconstipated.

02:39.661 --> 02:40.605
Creatively.

02:40.620 --> 02:41.581
Only took about a year.

02:42.097 --> 02:45.002
Okay, alright. But then
it's up to you, Jonathan. Please.

02:45.002 --> 02:46.326
Take her dancing, you know.

02:46.326 --> 02:47.344
Have an adventure!

02:47.344 --> 02:48.708
Go to Coney Island.

02:48.708 --> 02:49.221
Anything!

02:49.221 --> 02:51.968
Like a date, but...
platonic.

02:51.968 --> 02:52.622
Okay!

02:52.922 --> 02:53.864
I'm good at platonic.

02:53.864 --> 02:55.479
It's my default sexual setting.

02:55.661 --> 02:56.653
After nervous.

02:57.240 --> 02:57.804
Thank you.

03:02.675 --> 03:04.323
What are you working on, sweetheart?

03:04.323 --> 03:07.049
I finally made a breakthough on <i>SuperRay 2</i>!

03:07.628 --> 03:08.945
His son, Super Spencer,

03:09.353 --> 03:12.519
is kidnapped by The Emasculator...

03:12.812 --> 03:14.874
...kind of a... half-woman, half-plant.

03:15.851 --> 03:17.656
She looks like a Georgia O'Keeffe painting,

03:17.656 --> 03:18.906
except when you punch her,

03:19.235 --> 03:19.834
she, uh,

03:19.834 --> 03:21.638
gives you a urinary tract infection.

03:21.960 --> 03:23.821
Okay. You know what you're doing.

03:24.372 --> 03:27.783
You know, just work a few more minutes
and then get started on your chores.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.243
Look, can you do them today?

03:30.243 --> 03:32.837
I'm feeling, like,
really potent and thick.

03:33.165 --> 03:35.001
See, my pencil is Ron Jeremy.

03:35.704 --> 03:37.093
Usually I'm like this.

03:37.768 --> 03:38.897
But today I'm more like...

03:40.169 --> 03:42.954
...just, right on target, like,
just really bangin' it out.

03:43.110 --> 03:44.977
Yeah, but, Ray, that's not fair.

03:45.250 --> 03:48.298
I work all week, and today's my
day to just be with the girls.

03:48.298 --> 03:49.135
You know that!

03:49.135 --> 03:50.549
But I wanna draw!

04:02.346 --> 04:03.466
Ow! Gah!

04:11.321 --> 04:12.207
D'ow! Gah!

04:18.310 --> 04:18.805
Hmph!

04:26.927 --> 04:27.899
Slimming?

04:40.990 --> 04:42.356
New York is so lit up!

04:43.217 --> 04:46.476
Guess everyone's afraid of the dark,
but it's a great view.

04:46.842 --> 04:48.130
Yeah, it's great, but...

04:48.618 --> 04:52.562
only a young person like me would live above a
clough that makes the whole apartment shake.

04:52.983 --> 04:53.995
Wh—what?

04:53.995 --> 04:57.581
You'll see. In a minute, this place
will have a case of delirium tremens.

04:57.901 --> 04:58.579
Want a glass of wine?

04:58.802 --> 05:00.883
Oh! Um, no thanks, just water.

05:01.266 --> 05:03.215
I'm sorry I don't have
anything else to offer you.

05:03.368 --> 05:06.333
As a youthful bachelor, I live
off white wine and avocados.

05:07.118 --> 05:07.454
♪ahem♪

05:07.454 --> 05:08.129
Nice...

05:09.727 --> 05:11.407
Woah! Oh, haha!

05:11.407 --> 05:13.300
You know, you look a lot like George.

05:13.642 --> 05:15.470
I can see him hidden in your features.

05:15.469 --> 05:15.970
Really?

05:15.970 --> 05:18.321
Yeah, we're very close.
He's like a father to me!

05:18.453 --> 05:19.573
Which I kind of need.

05:19.615 --> 05:22.474
I'm searching for my biological dad,
but the trail's gone cold.

05:22.475 --> 05:24.714
Oh, but, aren't you a private detective?

05:24.998 --> 05:28.023
I saw your ad on Craigslist.
Your slogan was funny.

05:28.023 --> 05:29.055
But I don't have a slogan.

05:29.055 --> 05:30.024
Oh, yeah you do!

05:30.024 --> 05:30.913
"Need a dick?"

05:33.508 --> 05:34.568
That <i>is</i> catchy.

05:35.180 --> 05:36.147
But it's not mine.

05:36.314 --> 05:37.369
No, look!

05:39.852 --> 05:40.033
Hm.

05:47.088 --> 05:47.966
Oh my god!

05:49.205 --> 05:50.041
I have a double.

05:53.611 --> 05:55.148
Girls are all tucked in.

05:55.576 --> 05:56.260
That's good.

05:56.991 --> 06:00.681
Ray, is this the wrapping from the chicken?

06:01.757 --> 06:02.705
Yeah, why?

06:03.078 --> 06:05.204
You took the sticker off an apple.

06:05.795 --> 06:07.432
Well yeah, uhhhh, the—

06:08.208 --> 06:10.023
the apple was organic, so...

06:10.586 --> 06:13.125
You let the girls eat a factory farm chicken?

06:13.819 --> 06:16.171
That's in their perfect bellies right now?

06:16.292 --> 06:17.854
My back was spasming.

06:17.954 --> 06:20.596
I couldn't walk the extra block
to Trader Joe's, I'm sorry.

06:20.596 --> 06:21.979
I can't believe this!

06:21.976 --> 06:22.964
You poisoned them!

06:22.964 --> 06:26.186
You know I don't allow any
industrial food in their bodies.

06:26.187 --> 06:26.927
Leah, I-I—

06:26.927 --> 06:28.467
You put hormones into them!

06:28.467 --> 06:31.107
And I showed you that article on early breast development!

06:31.107 --> 06:32.217
What were you thinking?!

06:32.217 --> 06:35.605
I don't think one industrialized
chicken is gonna set off puberty!

06:35.605 --> 06:38.836
I didn't start developing breasts
until I was... I was in my thirties!

06:38.836 --> 06:39.532
- Ray,
- I was in my thirties.

06:39.532 --> 06:41.679
the one thing you're supposed
to do is shop for organic

06:41.683 --> 06:43.966
food and clean the house,
that was our agreement.

06:43.966 --> 06:45.491
I do! That's <i>all</i> I do!

06:45.717 --> 06:48.719
You know, I-I-I don't even get
drunk anymore, I only get stoned!

06:48.763 --> 06:50.289
I didn't draw Super Ray today!

06:50.289 --> 06:52.523
I only hang out with Jonathan three times a week!

06:53.298 --> 06:54.952
And I'm sick of being a Park Slope mom!

06:54.952 --> 06:57.304
Well, that's because you're
not a Park Slope man.

06:57.583 --> 06:58.606
Son of a bitch.

06:58.611 --> 07:00.330
I mean it's... eNOUGH!

07:01.549 --> 07:03.682
Did you just call me a bitch?

07:03.854 --> 07:04.418
No.

07:04.418 --> 07:05.459
But I would like to.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.418
Get out!

07:07.641 --> 07:08.009
Leah!

07:08.008 --> 07:08.689
Ow!

07:08.689 --> 07:09.274
My back!

07:09.274 --> 07:10.716
You called me a bitch!

07:10.767 --> 07:13.821
No, I didn't! I said I would like to!
There's a huge difference!

07:13.837 --> 07:16.137
Please leave! I j—I need some space!

07:26.842 --> 07:28.402
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

07:29.474 --> 07:30.594
and that...

07:31.797 --> 07:33.168
I'll try to be...

07:33.933 --> 07:35.053
a better person.

07:38.066 --> 07:38.839
Okay?

07:41.934 --> 07:45.829
This restaurant isn't open yet,
so this is sort of a preview.

07:45.829 --> 07:50.250
Like a Broadway show, you know.
Like, uh, <i>Spider-Man</i>. Or <i>Cats</i>.

07:50.894 --> 07:55.503
You know, as a T.S. Eliot fan, I have to say,
I did love <i>Cats</i> when it first came out.

07:55.503 --> 07:57.988
Yeah, there was a lot of
<i>pussy</i> in that show, huh?

07:59.681 --> 08:00.514
Bernard!

08:00.947 --> 08:02.948
What? But this is gonna
be a boy's night out.

08:03.260 --> 08:06.830
E-E-Emily told me that you liked
dirty jokes so... I don't know.

08:06.830 --> 08:08.114
- Well, here we are.
- Yes.

08:08.114 --> 08:11.308
Do—do you mind if I take
a quick hit of pot?

08:11.308 --> 08:12.599
It makes the food better.

08:12.599 --> 08:14.777
Wel— no, a-actually, no
a-a-actually, actually,

08:14.777 --> 08:16.102
I, I do mind.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.126
See, Emily loves to smell me,

08:18.126 --> 08:20.292
and I wanna respect her sobriety.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.000
I just, I can't have pot
smoke all over my clothing.

08:23.438 --> 08:24.516
She won't smell anything.

08:24.523 --> 08:26.691
No, just, George, George,
George, <i>please,</i>

08:26.691 --> 08:29.276
you know, Emily would like it if you'd
be more <i>attuned,</i>

08:29.276 --> 08:31.156
like a shaman, to her issues.

08:31.693 --> 08:33.982
That's why we came here,
for you to know her again.

08:33.982 --> 08:36.650
- Alright, alright, okay, okay,
no pot, just quit preaching.
- I mean— ok— alr—

08:36.650 --> 08:38.270
- Le- let, let's go in.
- I'm not <i>preaching,</i> but...

08:40.029 --> 08:42.254
Funny, the sign looks
just like my sign.

08:51.767 --> 08:52.887
George!

08:53.310 --> 08:54.796
What a surprise!

08:55.027 --> 08:56.504
Jesus, you look gaunt!

08:56.879 --> 08:59.669
Is the gruel you're serving at George on Jane making you sick?

08:59.673 --> 09:00.607
Who's your boyfriend?

09:01.752 --> 09:05.406
Oh... Bernard, Antrem.
Antrem, Bernard.

09:05.406 --> 09:06.273
What are you doing here?

09:06.273 --> 09:07.765
What, are you having a
mini-stroke or something?

09:07.765 --> 09:10.563
I'm the Richard in "Richard & Sons,"
you addled old sissy!

09:12.845 --> 09:13.852
Thanks for doing this.

09:14.025 --> 09:16.657
After I confront him, we can go to
this magic show on Williamsburg

09:16.657 --> 09:17.866
which will be very <i>youthful</i>.

09:17.866 --> 09:20.924
Why do you keep emphasizing that
we're gonna do "youthful" things?

09:21.969 --> 09:23.030
Oh! Jonathan Ames?

09:23.629 --> 09:24.350
Sometimes.

09:25.484 --> 09:26.640
How can I help you, Blondie?

09:26.828 --> 09:27.445
Who are you?

09:27.586 --> 09:28.781
Why are you impersonating me?

09:28.781 --> 09:30.498
I was wondering when you might show up.

09:30.998 --> 09:33.848
Well, love to talk to you sometime,
fish bait, but I'm busy.

09:34.600 --> 09:35.350
"Fish bait"?

09:35.350 --> 09:36.287
What do you mean you're busy?

09:36.287 --> 09:37.064
Explain yourself!

09:37.064 --> 09:39.274
You can't just walk away from me;
You've stolen my name!

09:39.274 --> 09:42.477
Another time, skin tag, I'm on a case,
and I don't wanna be late.

09:43.008 --> 09:45.395
Won't be good for our... reputation.

09:46.170 --> 09:47.326
You're on a case!?

09:47.881 --> 09:49.536
But you're wearing a windbreaker!

09:49.988 --> 09:51.430

Yeah.

10:06.730 --> 10:07.621
Don't rub it in.

10:07.949 --> 10:09.206
Why? What's the matter?

10:09.198 --> 10:10.568
She kicked me out of the house.

10:12.722 --> 10:14.542
Mind if I join ya, then?

10:16.486 --> 10:18.273
You're blue and lonely.

10:18.842 --> 10:20.200

10:32.303 --> 10:34.233
Can't believe I have an impersonator!

10:34.592 --> 10:36.835
Why isn't he trying
harder to look like me?

10:37.099 --> 10:40.172
How do you know he isn't trying?
We don't know what he looked like before.

10:40.254 --> 10:41.072
Good point.

10:41.080 --> 10:44.471
I'm sorry if we miss this magic show, but I
gotta figure out what this nut is up to.

10:44.470 --> 10:48.806
Oh, no, are you kidding me? This is much
more exciting. I feel really stimulated.

10:48.806 --> 10:52.173
Good. I love following people.
When I do it, I pretend like I'm a spy.

10:52.172 --> 10:55.239
Wait, you're a private detective
who pretends that he's a spy?

10:55.240 --> 10:57.809
Yeah, it's like wearing layers
in the winter, but with fantasy.

10:57.809 --> 10:59.366
- Quit following me, gumshoe!
- Woah, Woah, Woah!

10:59.699 --> 11:00.692
How did you know we were—?

11:01.637 --> 11:03.639
Where'd you even learn
to be a detective?

11:03.643 --> 11:04.838
I read your book.

11:04.838 --> 11:05.439
Really?

11:05.715 --> 11:06.465
Did you like it?

11:06.465 --> 11:07.325
So-so.

11:07.325 --> 11:09.453
Your endings are weak, and I found a typo.

11:09.453 --> 11:11.623
My endings are intentionally vague!

11:11.623 --> 11:13.207
But one book isn't enough training!

11:13.214 --> 11:15.590
I read all of Hammett and Chandler
before I went professional!

11:15.590 --> 11:17.582
All right, lord it over me, ass rash,

11:17.582 --> 11:19.653
but you and the frail
better quit trailin' me!

11:19.756 --> 11:20.633
I don't like it!

11:20.633 --> 11:22.443
Tough shit, we're coming on the case!

11:22.450 --> 11:22.950
All right.

11:23.654 --> 11:26.410
But only because it'll be nice to have a broad on a stakeout.

11:26.410 --> 11:28.014
It'll help pass the time

11:29.277 --> 11:31.040
We can play Spin the Dame.

11:32.820 --> 11:36.263
I can't believe Antrem is
cultivating Salman Rushdie!

11:36.263 --> 11:38.200
I mean, he's my number one customer!

11:38.494 --> 11:42.275
He- he loves our line-caught striped bass.
You should never have brought me here.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.704
- Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know! I...
- George Christopher! Welcome.

11:46.433 --> 11:49.994
Please tell me that Jonathan hasn't
infected the premises, has he?

11:50.140 --> 11:51.841
No, no, he's not, not here.

11:51.841 --> 11:55.083
But wh— what are you doing, Louis?
I don't understand the costume

11:55.083 --> 11:57.910
I know it's unusual to see me
in such a reduced station,

11:57.910 --> 12:01.038
but Richard was good enough to hire
me under the work release program

12:01.038 --> 12:04.477
after I was arrested for...
vandalizing the Dick Cavett set.

12:04.484 --> 12:06.562
Oh, well. Well, I'm sorry, sorry about that.

12:06.570 --> 12:08.094
But, come here, let, lemme ask you something.

12:08.094 --> 12:11.399
Wh- why is this place called "Richard & <i>Sons</i>"?

12:11.406 --> 12:12.832
Antrem doesn't have any children.

12:12.832 --> 12:15.926
No, that's true, but, uh, he's
always wanted male heirs, and

12:15.934 --> 12:19.919
I think Richard and I both agree that I fulfill
the role of "son" in "Richard & Sons."

12:19.919 --> 12:23.679
Oh! Sorry to be a fuss-budget,
but it's plural. "Sons."

12:23.687 --> 12:26.804
Yes, we're also thinking about
adopting one of the Filipino busboys.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.067
You know, to complete the family.

12:28.067 --> 12:30.314
- And tax purposes.
- What did I say about talking to guests?

12:31.699 --> 12:32.392
Sorry, Richard.

12:32.392 --> 12:35.337
Excuse me, gentlemen, I've got to go
verbally lash my coworkers.

12:35.916 --> 12:37.020
Out of my way!

12:37.333 --> 12:38.453
Excuse me!

12:39.256 --> 12:40.357
He's a good boy.

12:40.661 --> 12:43.399
I love humiliating him.
You can see how deep it cuts.

12:43.767 --> 12:46.739
Richard, why did you
open a restaurant?

12:46.739 --> 12:50.143
Saw what you did, hated it,
thought I could do better.

12:50.142 --> 12:51.295
That's not very pleasant.

12:51.296 --> 12:52.617
I-I-I'll handle this.

12:52.617 --> 12:53.257
You know,

12:54.012 --> 12:55.687
...that wasn't very pleasant.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.507
You know something?
You're no- you're nothing but a...

12:57.810 --> 12:58.852
...a copycat!

12:58.852 --> 13:00.327
That's pretty tough talk

13:00.327 --> 13:03.068
for someone who has to go a hundred
miles to get his radicchio!

13:03.217 --> 13:04.231
What's that supposed to mean?

13:04.239 --> 13:08.646
All of our produce and proteins come
from within fifty miles of New York!

13:09.005 --> 13:10.157
You claim a hundred.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.164
Do the math!

13:11.164 --> 13:13.262
I'm gonna dominate the artisanal scene!

13:13.262 --> 13:16.162
Fifty miles? But that—that's not possible!

13:16.418 --> 13:18.119
Looks like loverboy needs a drink.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.183
This is bad.

13:24.044 --> 13:25.394
This is very bad.

13:33.224 --> 13:34.936
Oh my god, that's obscene!

13:35.840 --> 13:37.059
This is a really good case!

13:37.067 --> 13:37.995
I wanna look!

13:37.995 --> 13:39.138
No, it's too upsetting.

13:39.138 --> 13:40.332
Are you a member of PETA?

13:40.332 --> 13:42.270
Don't protect her.
She's a grown woman.

13:42.603 --> 13:43.560
What are you, a C-cup?

13:43.560 --> 13:46.903
Oh! Don't be rude,
and <i>you,</i> don't stop me. I wanna look!

13:48.892 --> 13:50.467
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

13:50.676 --> 13:53.403
Mm, that doesn't bother me.
I used to be a plushie.

13:53.505 --> 13:54.239
Really?

13:54.239 --> 13:56.240
Yeah, I've had a lot of phases.

13:56.240 --> 13:57.024
That's good.

13:57.024 --> 13:58.330
I like troubled women.

13:58.330 --> 13:59.602
Makes 'em needy.

14:00.369 --> 14:01.840
So what's the plan?

14:02.043 --> 14:04.588
I gotta get a picture of that
horny tiger with his helmet off.

14:04.588 --> 14:06.681
That's the one I'm trying
to catch in the act.

14:06.685 --> 14:07.568
Who hired you?

14:07.568 --> 14:08.785
Tiger's boyfriend.

14:08.785 --> 14:11.413
He's a handsome power
bottom, but not a plushie.

14:11.685 --> 14:15.061
Tiger over there was supposed to
give up his taste for the fur.

14:15.061 --> 14:16.980
I've worked these kinds of cases.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.140
Yeah? Well,

14:19.817 --> 14:21.410
the only thing to do now is wait.

14:21.788 --> 14:23.433
That's one way to go about it.

14:23.561 --> 14:24.874
What's the other way?

14:26.866 --> 14:28.388
We could, uhh...

14:29.891 --> 14:32.270
This is how real detectives
pass the time.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.012
Want a hit, dollface?
It'll improve my looks.

14:35.012 --> 14:36.361
Um, no, thank you.

14:36.361 --> 14:37.349
I'll have some.

14:37.692 --> 14:39.155
I've also got pot,

14:39.155 --> 14:41.736
which is another way
that real detectives...

14:41.736 --> 14:43.167
...pass the time.

14:49.891 --> 14:52.001
I'm on supervised visits with my son.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.917
Only get to play with him
in front of his mother.

14:55.552 --> 14:58.104
I have no income,
and my art career is shit.

14:58.877 --> 15:00.225
And my girlfriend hates me.

15:00.664 --> 15:02.060
I feel for you, Ray.

15:02.271 --> 15:03.998
You got nothin' going for you.

15:03.998 --> 15:04.654
Well, I—

15:04.654 --> 15:06.917
It's like a bad run in cards.

15:06.919 --> 15:09.057
But these things pass,

15:09.057 --> 15:10.840
and then you get a good run.

15:10.840 --> 15:12.882
But I know, when you lose,

15:13.430 --> 15:16.230
it feels like you're gonna lose forever.

15:17.566 --> 15:19.163
Yeah. That's where I am right now.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.107
All bad cards.
Plus I have back spasms.

15:22.293 --> 15:24.725
I had a streak like yours in my forties.

15:25.226 --> 15:28.898
My husband acted drunk one night
and slept with my sister.

15:29.046 --> 15:33.358
She was having a breakdown, going
haywire, wasn't thinking clearly,

15:33.357 --> 15:34.217
and he...

15:35.210 --> 15:36.618
...he was a man.

15:38.086 --> 15:39.416
I understand.

15:51.305 --> 15:53.511
That tiger's head has
a functional mouth,

15:53.512 --> 15:55.201
so I don't think he's
ever gonna remove it.

15:55.201 --> 15:55.921
He will.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.399
After he cums, he'll lose
interest and take the head off.

15:58.936 --> 16:00.934
Underneath that costume is a man.

16:00.943 --> 16:02.461
What's that supposed to mean?

16:02.466 --> 16:04.310
After an orgasm, a male,

16:04.880 --> 16:07.293
even a plushophile,
just wants to move on.

16:07.293 --> 16:10.364
Kiss me a few times, and I'll...
prove my theory to you.

16:10.364 --> 16:11.583
Hey! Let's keep this civil!

16:11.583 --> 16:13.935
Yeah. Back off, Romeo, I'm engaged.

16:13.943 --> 16:15.450
To this pimple of a preschooler?

16:15.458 --> 16:17.548
No, no, to a much, <i>much</i> older man.

16:18.415 --> 16:18.907
Wha—?

16:19.329 --> 16:20.400
I'm sorry.

16:20.983 --> 16:23.368
I'm stoned.
Tha— that's what George told me.

16:23.368 --> 16:25.037
Oh my God!

16:25.045 --> 16:27.553
Eugh, my dad is such a jerk!

16:27.655 --> 16:30.383
What <i>exactly</i> did he say about Bernard?

16:30.383 --> 16:31.143
Nothing!

16:31.143 --> 16:32.809
Just that he's older,

16:32.809 --> 16:36.105
and that he wanted me to show
you a youthful good time,

16:36.105 --> 16:37.220
and, um...

16:37.830 --> 16:38.355
that's it.

16:38.355 --> 16:39.209
Bullshit!

16:39.668 --> 16:41.855
As somebody with borderline
personality disorder,

16:41.855 --> 16:44.911
I'm like a human polygraph,
and I can tell you're lying.

16:44.911 --> 16:48.881
Forget that. What else did George say?
I really want you to tell me!

16:48.881 --> 16:50.966
- Pteh.
- You have to tell me!

16:50.974 --> 16:53.908
Otherwise I'll just make it up,
and it'll probably be worse.

16:54.522 --> 16:57.269
He's just very concerned
about you having children,

16:57.277 --> 17:00.496
he said that you were talking
about your ripe plums—

17:00.503 --> 17:03.187
He talked about my <i>plums</i> ?

17:03.187 --> 17:04.700
Yes, but in a loving way!

17:04.700 --> 17:05.742
Ugh!

17:05.847 --> 17:06.776
Grhhh!

17:06.776 --> 17:07.573
Guh!

17:07.573 --> 17:09.008
Fuck him!

17:09.008 --> 17:09.982
Sweetheart!

17:10.790 --> 17:12.884
Your dad sounds like a real perv.

17:13.611 --> 17:16.846
But you do have gorgeous plums, I...
love a C-cup.

17:16.846 --> 17:20.549
Just take a slug and relax.
It'll be good for ya.

17:22.549 --> 17:23.434
Guhh!

17:26.721 --> 17:28.128
Now we're on a stakeout!

17:33.034 --> 17:34.981
We might as well be
sitting in the kitchen!

17:34.981 --> 17:37.890
Oh, George, I'm so sorry about all this.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.140
I wanted us to have a good time.

17:40.140 --> 17:41.541
I want you to like me!

17:41.541 --> 17:42.476
I like you.

17:42.476 --> 17:47.021
Ye— look, I don't care about that right now!
I'm trying to observe the competition.

17:47.021 --> 17:50.913
If Antrem gets the artisinal crowd,
It could be the end of George on Jane.

17:50.913 --> 17:54.650
It could be the end of me, because
stupidly I invested all my money in it.

17:58.392 --> 18:00.232
Can I have your attention please?

18:00.861 --> 18:04.708
Thank you so much for coming
to the opening of Richard & Sons.

18:04.971 --> 18:06.765
- As some of you may know,
- Do you mind?

18:06.765 --> 18:09.960
we are trying to elevate
New York City's connection

18:09.960 --> 18:11.027
with its food.

18:11.629 --> 18:14.990
We promote only truly local fare

18:15.320 --> 18:16.636
grown by vegans

18:16.719 --> 18:18.449
and conscientious objectors.

18:23.051 --> 18:24.940
Some restaurants in New York City,

18:24.940 --> 18:27.534
like that salmonella shack George on Jane,

18:27.534 --> 18:30.269
falsely claim that a hundred miles is local.

18:30.995 --> 18:33.618
I say, why travel that far

18:33.980 --> 18:36.711
when New York City itself
is far greener than that?

18:36.711 --> 18:38.384
You know, and itself provides an—

18:38.384 --> 18:39.655
- an eco–role-model
- Woah!

18:39.655 --> 18:43.040
- for the enti—
- Woah! Oh!
A, a rat just ran up my pant leg!

18:43.040 --> 18:44.501
A large rat!

18:44.501 --> 18:45.955
Oh my God! There it goes!

18:45.955 --> 18:47.703
Ahh! I think I see it!

18:47.703 --> 18:50.855
- Everybody calm down!
- Something just ran over my foot!

18:51.465 --> 18:52.281
Fire!

18:52.281 --> 18:53.060
- Fire!
- What?!

18:53.060 --> 18:54.573
I think the rat's on fire!

18:54.573 --> 18:56.949
Wait!
You senile bitch!

18:56.949 --> 18:58.875
There's no fuckin' rat on fire!

19:00.241 --> 19:01.245
Assholes!

19:02.388 --> 19:04.580
Tiger is going to the door....

19:10.211 --> 19:12.200
Holy shit, threesome.

19:12.586 --> 19:15.072
Think you'll learn something from these dudes.

19:15.604 --> 19:18.276
Lemme see, Mister Borderline.

19:18.706 --> 19:19.834
There you go.

19:21.385 --> 19:23.767
- It's hot when you're
dismissive, keep it up.
- Yeah...

19:25.501 --> 19:26.939
Nice dance.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.470
Okay, I'm gonna go down to
the bar and take a squirt.

19:30.970 --> 19:31.775
Emily?

19:33.533 --> 19:34.541
Are you all right?

19:34.876 --> 19:36.974
Ye- yeah, I'm fine, I just have to pee.

19:37.548 --> 19:41.997
Be sure to layer the seat with T.P.,
that place looked nasty!

19:41.997 --> 19:44.096
Gotta keep that hot ass clean.

19:44.779 --> 19:46.131
She's blitzed.

19:46.131 --> 19:47.149
I like it.

19:48.537 --> 19:50.140
Hey, this is getting good.

19:50.140 --> 19:50.840
Yeah.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.622
So why exactly are you pretending to be me?

19:54.427 --> 19:55.437
What do you care?

19:55.445 --> 19:58.904
What do you mean? Of course I care!
I've never had my identity stolen before.

19:58.911 --> 20:00.167
Never been that popular.

20:00.167 --> 20:03.152
Well, I read about you in the paper,
and I figured I could do what you do.

20:03.152 --> 20:06.065
I watch a lot of noir films,
and I'm on disability.

20:06.065 --> 20:07.971
Jesus! That hardly qualifies you.

20:07.978 --> 20:09.010
Shut up!

20:09.683 --> 20:11.113
No, I won't shut up!

20:11.113 --> 20:15.792
And, as my imposter, I think you should
be a bit more respectful towards me.

20:15.784 --> 20:18.055
Alright, alright,
don't get your braids in a knot.

20:19.374 --> 20:22.986
Hey. Tiger's going back to the door.
This orgy's getting bigger.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.092
Oh, my God, that's Emily!

20:29.482 --> 20:33.195
Good girl, now just get out of the way
so I can see his face....

20:33.448 --> 20:35.602
Oh, my God, that tiger smacked her!

20:35.729 --> 20:36.616
Oh, lemme see!

20:39.119 --> 20:41.898
- Those animals are gonna eat her!
- Let's go, we gotta save her!

20:43.661 --> 20:44.689
A mop?!

20:51.182 --> 20:52.549
Right behind ya!

20:56.293 --> 20:58.133
We didn't mean to hurt her.

20:59.806 --> 21:01.012
Holy shit!

21:01.642 --> 21:03.973
Smells like fur and jizz in here!

21:07.859 --> 21:09.555
I like the way you eat.

21:09.555 --> 21:11.208
You have a nice body.

21:11.266 --> 21:12.050
Mm, thank you.

21:12.405 --> 21:14.230
It's like a fat brick.

21:14.669 --> 21:16.570
That's how my Nat was.

21:17.757 --> 21:20.392
Can't eat more.
My girdle's pinching me.

21:20.673 --> 21:24.285
You know what you should try for your back? Oxycontin.

21:24.285 --> 21:28.420
I was on it when I got my new hip.
It's good for the whole body.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.909
I've heard that stuff is great,
especially if you snort it.

21:30.909 --> 21:33.798
My girlfriend Rita told me the same thing.

21:35.058 --> 21:38.818
You know, I didn't take
all the pills after the surgery.

21:39.994 --> 21:44.896
You could come back to my place, and
have some if you like.

21:44.896 --> 21:46.193
You can call Rita?

21:47.321 --> 21:48.515
Make it a party?

21:48.888 --> 21:49.782
Ah...

21:52.337 --> 21:54.038
I'm really sorry about everything.

21:57.867 --> 21:59.289
See ya, sugar plums.

21:59.992 --> 22:01.698
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

22:02.918 --> 22:03.794
We did it!

22:04.153 --> 22:07.052
We make a great team.
My brains, your name—

22:07.052 --> 22:08.623
Here's what's gonna happen.

22:08.623 --> 22:11.637
You're gonna take down that ad,
you're gonna stop using my name,

22:11.637 --> 22:12.921
and I'm never gonna see you again.

22:13.083 --> 22:13.778
Fine!

22:13.778 --> 22:15.519
I'm getting out of this racket anyway.

22:15.519 --> 22:19.139
I just needed the thousand bucks to
get certified as a massage therapist.

22:20.273 --> 22:21.771
They charge a thousand dollars?

22:27.666 --> 22:30.729
Mm, you know, whenever I'm depressed,

22:31.619 --> 22:34.535
I'm gonna picture Antrem's face
as it was tonight.

22:34.822 --> 22:37.227
Even if he drives me out of business,

22:37.227 --> 22:39.117
I will have that to hold on to.

22:39.327 --> 22:40.639
You should know, George,

22:40.639 --> 22:44.466
that if you ever do need a loan
to keep the restaurant going,

22:45.746 --> 22:46.814
I'm here for you.

22:47.488 --> 22:47.919
Alright?

22:48.024 --> 22:49.262
No, I couldn't do that.

22:49.989 --> 22:53.924
I—I sold my tech company for a
hundred fifty million dollars.

22:53.924 --> 22:59.527
I only tell you this to reassure you
that I can help you if you need it.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.947
You'd really help me?

23:00.947 --> 23:05.148
- We— anything for my
future father-in-law!
- Oh!

23:08.247 --> 23:10.980
- Oh, hey, you know. No cell phones.
- Oh! Emily.

23:11.201 --> 23:13.591
- She's probably checkin' on us.
- Fine, fine, fine.

23:15.037 --> 23:15.994
Emily?

23:17.308 --> 23:18.161
What?!

23:19.579 --> 23:20.762
I'll be right home.

23:21.644 --> 23:25.414
Emily was attacked by a
homosexual tiger in Brooklyn!

23:32.655 --> 23:35.569
Emily's perfect Christopher
nose is broken!

23:35.569 --> 23:37.955
- I, I'm so sorry, George!
- You know, I, I can't <i>believe</i>

23:37.955 --> 23:40.738
that you got her drunk <i>and</i> stoned?

23:40.738 --> 23:43.143
I mean, she's in AA, Jonathan!

23:43.143 --> 23:44.073
You didn't tell me that!

23:44.073 --> 23:44.804
Well—!

23:45.512 --> 23:47.895
I'm in denial about her sobriety.

23:47.895 --> 23:50.040
You're supposed to be in
denial about her using!

23:50.046 --> 23:52.655
No! No, no! You know, I
trusted you with my daughter!

23:52.655 --> 23:56.194
I followed your instructions, we had an
adventure, I did the best that I could!

23:56.194 --> 24:00.226
No! You didn't! And now she won't
talk to me anymore! I mean...

24:00.397 --> 24:03.476
She says I'm a people, place,
and, and thing, which is

24:03.476 --> 24:06.571
AA speak for something
that causes a relapse.

24:06.576 --> 24:07.490
Oh, George.

24:07.497 --> 24:09.232
Don't you understand what happened?

24:09.232 --> 24:12.099
I w—I was rebuilding our, our
relationship, and, and...

24:12.481 --> 24:15.334
now I'm not a father
anymore, I'm a trigger!

24:15.334 --> 24:18.808
I'm sorry! Things got out of control,
but you were the one who wanted me

24:18.808 --> 24:21.082
to sabotage her
engagement with Bernard!

24:21.082 --> 24:23.451
No! Not anymore!
He's a beautiful person!

24:23.451 --> 24:27.014
But you! You crossed every
line tonight, Jonathan.

24:27.014 --> 24:30.909
Now I just wanted to tell you in person.
I'm very, very disappointed in you.

24:32.308 --> 24:33.046
That's all.

24:35.183 --> 24:36.389
George, please!

24:36.389 --> 24:37.380
You know something?

24:38.059 --> 24:41.659
Emily's taking a break from me,
so I'm taking a break from you.

24:46.060 --> 24:49.234
You mean like...
