00:02.002 --> 00:03.003
Previously on "How to Get Away
with Murder"...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.045
We immediately
suspend your license.

00:04.045 --> 00:05.256
You can't fire me
because of this.

00:05.256 --> 00:07.548
Without a license,
your tenure gets nullified.

00:07.548 --> 00:08.889
You're an alcoholic.

00:08.889 --> 00:10.091
No, the problem is
you're a little bitch!

00:10.091 --> 00:11.722
Get help.

00:11.722 --> 00:14.055
My name is Annalise Keating,
and I'm an alcoholic.

00:14.055 --> 00:15.015
Nate?

00:15.015 --> 00:16.016
You don't know how long

00:16.016 --> 00:17.138
I've been wanting this
to happen.

00:17.138 --> 00:18.479
My father's dead.

00:18.479 --> 00:20.351
I lied.
My father found Frank.

00:20.351 --> 00:21.602
He's in Coalport.

00:21.602 --> 00:22.773
He killed your father.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.405
Don't tell Annalise.

00:24.405 --> 00:26.777
Dr. Lowell!
She's pregnant.

00:26.777 --> 00:27.908
Oh, my God.

00:27.908 --> 00:29.360
I know her.

00:36.747 --> 00:37.498
sign of hydrops

00:37.498 --> 00:38.869
Good.

00:38.869 --> 00:40.251
And what's taking
the O.B. so long?

00:40.251 --> 00:41.542
Page down to plastics.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.254
We need to debride these burns.
Do they not know that?

00:49.840 --> 00:53.013
There is some concern
with smoke inhalation.

00:53.013 --> 00:54.935
Uh. What does that mean?
Is she gonna die?

00:54.935 --> 00:56.937
Okay, you need
to keep your voice down, okay?

00:56.937 --> 00:58.939
I could get in a lot of trouble
for even telling you this.

00:58.939 --> 01:00.181
I just want to make sure
she's okay.

01:00.181 --> 01:01.312
I'm sorry.

01:01.312 --> 01:03.144
I know,
and I promise you,

01:03.144 --> 01:05.316
I'm gonna tell you
everything I can, okay?

01:05.316 --> 01:07.608
H-Have you thought about
contacting the others?

01:07.608 --> 01:08.949
No. What am I --

01:08.949 --> 01:11.402
I wanted to make sure
we had more information...

01:11.402 --> 01:12.743
Hi.

01:14.535 --> 01:16.407
I'm here.
Just don't worry.

01:16.407 --> 01:17.998
I know. I'm on it.

01:17.998 --> 01:19.700
Please try to trust me.

01:22.163 --> 01:23.794
Laurel's pregnant.

01:27.798 --> 01:29.710
We're happy to plan
whatever you like.

01:29.710 --> 01:32.343
The funeral, flowers,
any burial services.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.475
That won't be
necessary.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.928
Do you need a moment?

01:37.928 --> 01:39.430
No.

01:56.036 --> 01:56.907
Cremate him.

01:56.907 --> 01:57.788
Of course.

01:57.788 --> 02:00.080
Just are you in town
for a bit?

02:00.080 --> 02:03.123
You could pick up the ashes,
or we could mail them.

02:07.918 --> 02:10.211
Can anyone see you calling me
right now?

02:10.211 --> 02:11.592
No, I'm in my car.

02:11.592 --> 02:12.593
Where are you?

02:12.593 --> 02:14.175
Leaving the funeral home.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.135
Oh. How was it?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.387
Lovely.

02:16.387 --> 02:18.309
Stupid question.
Sorry.

02:18.309 --> 02:19.930
Have you seen Frank?

02:19.930 --> 02:21.182
No.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.434
You'll call me
when you do?

02:23.434 --> 02:25.186
If I do.

02:25.186 --> 02:27.358
I'll call you later.

02:42.283 --> 02:43.624
Thank you.

02:53.294 --> 02:54.965
So, Meggy wants to have

02:54.965 --> 02:57.468
a buttload of your babies,
basically?
No.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.179
Mm. You better start saving
for a ring.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.101
Personally, I think anything
under three karats

03:01.101 --> 03:02.563
is a red flag.

03:02.563 --> 03:03.894
What are you guys
talking about?

03:03.894 --> 03:05.856
Waitlist is meeting Meggy's
parents tonight.

03:05.856 --> 03:07.898
Her father's in town.
We're just having dinner.

03:07.898 --> 03:08.859
Oh, that's a big deal.

03:08.859 --> 03:09.940
-It's not.
-It is.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.982
And you need to dump her
before this goes bad.

03:11.982 --> 03:14.275
Meggy's amazing.
Why would he break up with her?

03:14.275 --> 03:16.317
None of us at this table
are fit to date civilians.

03:16.317 --> 03:17.618
That's ridiculous.

03:17.618 --> 03:19.780
No, what's ridiculous is you
dating doughnut-hole here

03:19.780 --> 03:21.412
when the only thing you guys
have in common is murder.

03:21.412 --> 03:23.083
Can we not talk about this
right here?

03:23.083 --> 03:24.585
Maybe I should date
Waitlist.

03:24.585 --> 03:26.206
Or Laurel.
Or we could be a throuple.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.709
I mean, that makes just about
as much sense as you two boning.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.920
Actually, technically,

03:29.920 --> 03:31.131
my hotness and I
are not boning right now.

03:31.131 --> 03:32.212
I'm pulling
a "Bull Durham"

03:32.212 --> 03:33.544
until the arbitration
exam's over.

03:33.544 --> 03:35.045
Hey, guys,
I got a trade opportunity.

03:35.045 --> 03:36.176
Dumbass Gavin over there

03:36.176 --> 03:38.008
hasn't even started
the evidence outline.

03:38.008 --> 03:39.970
Any of you be willing to trade
for my arbitration outline?

03:41.011 --> 03:42.843
Uh...yeah.
I'm doing our evidence outline.

03:42.843 --> 03:44.184
I can get it to you
by Monday

03:44.184 --> 03:46.016
Great.

03:46.016 --> 03:47.688
Did you actually do
the reading for evidence?

03:47.688 --> 03:49.059
No, and I didn't
for this exam either,

03:49.059 --> 03:50.190
so I'm just gonna --
Oh, my God.

03:50.190 --> 03:51.231
What is that?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.483
Uh...
it's a xeroxed ass.

03:52.483 --> 03:53.904
My ass!

03:53.904 --> 03:55.616
Does that
turn you on, Walsh?

03:55.616 --> 03:57.278
This is
sexual harassment.

03:57.278 --> 03:58.739
Why don't you go
tattletale to Mommy then?

03:58.739 --> 04:01.412
Oh, that's right.
She's still suspended.

04:06.036 --> 04:09.209
But your
assistant called and canceled.

04:09.209 --> 04:11.632
I'm so over her.

04:11.632 --> 04:13.834
That's the third time
she canceled at the last minute.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.426
I told her
not to come back.

04:15.426 --> 04:16.717
I ain't trying to deal
with anyone.

04:16.717 --> 04:18.218
Hey, Camila, I get it.

04:18.218 --> 04:19.840
That's right.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.342
It's because of your mouth.

04:21.342 --> 04:22.643
What my mouth got to do
with anything?

04:22.643 --> 04:24.264
You've got a loud mouth.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.306
Don't be dealing with that
all the time.

04:25.306 --> 04:26.807
That's true.

04:26.807 --> 04:27.978
Miss Annalise,
can I get you some champagne?

04:29.149 --> 04:30.941
She's a little lost
in her own world today.

04:30.941 --> 04:33.063
Ain't that right, Annalise?

04:33.063 --> 04:34.315
I'm sorry.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.026
Yvonne asked you if you wanted
something to drink.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.237
You look
like you need it.

04:37.237 --> 04:38.278
We got champagne.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.491
Cheap champagne.
I do not recommend it.

04:40.491 --> 04:41.822
I'm trying to cut back.

04:41.822 --> 04:43.113
Why?
You pregnant?

04:43.113 --> 04:45.706
Oh, please. My eggs dried up
a long time ago.

04:45.706 --> 04:47.368
Then you can't use your period
as an excuse

04:47.368 --> 04:48.789
for this mood you in.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.751
What's wrong? You finally
screw up with the cop?

04:50.751 --> 04:52.793
Since when has my mood
been dependent on a man?

04:52.793 --> 04:54.465
Ooh, does that mean
you done with him?

04:54.465 --> 04:56.216
There she go.
Queen of THOT-land.

04:56.216 --> 04:58.589
Y'all know my radar
perks up

04:58.589 --> 05:01.472
when the conversation
turns to fine-ass sexy men.

05:01.472 --> 05:02.763
If you're talking
about that same guy

05:02.763 --> 05:04.345
that you showed me
in that picture one day,

05:04.345 --> 05:05.386
then I want first dibs.

05:05.386 --> 05:06.727
I got him next.

05:06.727 --> 05:08.308
Ooh, honey, I would love
to take them --

05:08.308 --> 05:09.850
You'd love to what?

05:09.850 --> 05:12.272
Be with a man
who don't cry after sex.

05:12.272 --> 05:15.145
You know what? That's why
I don't tell you nothing, Ro.

05:15.145 --> 05:17.317
Wait. You want to know
what your problem is, Professor?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.779
You're too greedy.

05:18.779 --> 05:20.361
First you're not happy
with the white man,

05:20.361 --> 05:21.902
now you're not happy
with the black man.

05:21.902 --> 05:23.784
Better than being sloppy
like some people I know,

05:23.784 --> 05:25.446
sleeping with their husband's
friends.

05:25.446 --> 05:26.947
But see, it worked,
didn't it?

05:26.947 --> 05:28.579
I found out Tyler
was screwing our neighbor.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.210
Heffa, everyone knew
your husband

05:30.210 --> 05:31.502
was sleeping
with the neighbor.

05:31.502 --> 05:33.003
Well,
how come no one told me?

05:33.003 --> 05:34.164
We did!
We did!

05:34.164 --> 05:35.335
See, that's messed up.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.627
What's up, ladies?

05:36.627 --> 05:39.420
Oh, no! Gone, gone!
You know the rules. Out!

05:39.420 --> 05:40.671
We don't want your stuff.

05:40.671 --> 05:42.923
I told his druggy behind
not to come in here anymore.

05:42.923 --> 05:45.926
Y'all know he harmless.
He just down on his luck.

05:45.926 --> 05:47.428
For the last 10 years?

05:47.428 --> 05:49.269
Well, it took me 14
to get my ass clean.

05:49.269 --> 05:50.851
Clean from what?

05:50.851 --> 05:52.733
Oh, Ro didn't tell you
about her crack-den days?

05:52.733 --> 05:54.775
It was cocaine mostly.

05:54.775 --> 05:56.737
Rick wasn't playing when he said
it was a hell of a drug.

05:56.737 --> 05:57.898
But I did the work,

05:57.898 --> 06:00.110
used God and sex
to make me feel good,

06:00.110 --> 06:02.403
throw some AA meetings in there,
and I'm good to go.

06:02.403 --> 06:03.864
She still drinks.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.325
It was that one time.

06:05.325 --> 06:06.787
If you mean by "one time"

06:06.787 --> 06:08.038
every Tuesday and Thursday
down at Jazzy C's...

06:08.038 --> 06:09.540
Why'd you do it?

06:11.492 --> 06:12.913
Which part?

06:12.913 --> 06:14.705
You think this is funny?

06:14.705 --> 06:18.048
Annalise would kill me
if she knew I was here, Frank.

06:18.048 --> 06:19.129
Mm, take a number.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.421
She's probably got
another hit man

06:20.421 --> 06:21.802
on his way here
right now.

06:21.802 --> 06:23.383
I don't blame her
for that.

06:28.469 --> 06:32.272
You shot Mahoney while Wes
was standing right there.

06:32.272 --> 06:35.355
Why?

06:35.355 --> 06:37.187
What? You didn't?

06:37.187 --> 06:40.821
Somebody else
just happened to shoot him?

06:40.821 --> 06:43.073
It was me.

06:43.073 --> 06:45.576
Why take Wes?

06:47.948 --> 06:50.290
I needed to know
she wasn't gonna come after me.

06:50.290 --> 06:53.744
You made him a suspect.
That is why she came after you.

06:57.588 --> 07:00.591
Maybe Sam
was wrong about me.

07:00.591 --> 07:02.633
Don't say that.

07:02.633 --> 07:04.805
None of this
would've ever happened

07:04.805 --> 07:07.638
if they just left me
in there.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.399
Get up.

07:19.399 --> 07:20.771
Why?

07:20.771 --> 07:23.694
'Cause we're
gonna beat your ass.

07:23.694 --> 07:27.237
Kidding.
You got a visitor.

07:34.284 --> 07:35.576
Who the hell are you?

07:35.576 --> 07:37.127
Dr. Keating.

07:38.288 --> 07:39.880
Sit.

07:41.421 --> 07:44.885
Your Aunt Bev knows my sister
Hannah from high school.

07:44.885 --> 07:47.718
She was saying
how worried your family is,

07:47.718 --> 07:49.890
that nobody's
heard from you.

07:49.890 --> 07:52.052
You don't want them
to visit?

07:52.052 --> 07:53.303
I'm in solitary.

07:53.303 --> 07:55.355
Yeah,
but that was before.

07:55.355 --> 07:56.476
You haven't spoken
to your parents

07:56.476 --> 07:57.477
in -- what -- a few months?

07:59.650 --> 08:02.022
Okay, look, I've worked
with a lot of people

08:02.022 --> 08:03.904
in your
similar situation.

08:03.904 --> 08:05.365
Sociopaths?

08:05.365 --> 08:08.609
You've been incarcerated
since you were 13, Frank.

08:08.609 --> 08:09.820
There's tons of research

08:09.820 --> 08:11.822
to show how that
impacts family dynamics.

08:11.822 --> 08:13.413
Good to know.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.459
Truth?

08:19.459 --> 08:21.712
Your parents told me
you were up for parole.

08:21.712 --> 08:22.753
And they want to do
whatever they can

08:22.753 --> 08:24.254
to get you out of here.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.176
I even have
a lawyer for a wife

08:26.176 --> 08:30.130
who I believe
can win your case.

08:30.130 --> 08:34.514
And I can see it in you, too.
Frank -- you want out of here.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.516
Let me
help get you there.

08:42.983 --> 08:44.234
Threatening a guard,
assaulting an inmate,

08:44.234 --> 08:45.736
and that's on top
of attempted murder?

08:45.736 --> 08:46.987
Here's what I think.

08:46.987 --> 08:49.109
You need to say "No"
to your sister

08:49.109 --> 08:50.490
for once in your life.

08:50.490 --> 08:52.152
So...I take it
that's a no?

08:52.152 --> 08:54.915
Well, if you want me
to take a case pro bono,

08:54.915 --> 08:58.288
how about not a white boy
who has violent tendencies?

09:04.294 --> 09:05.545
What?

09:05.545 --> 09:06.927
Well,
how is this different

09:06.927 --> 09:08.929
than you asking me
to help Bonnie?

09:08.929 --> 09:10.671
Bonnie didn't try
to kill her father.

09:10.671 --> 09:12.132
She might've
if we hadn't helped her.

09:12.132 --> 09:13.383
That's a reach.

09:13.383 --> 09:14.635
Just -- Just hear me out.

09:14.635 --> 09:17.808
He's poor,
and his family's hurting.

09:17.808 --> 09:21.181
What's the harm
in just going to see him?

09:24.484 --> 09:26.066
Don't get up.

09:26.066 --> 09:28.318
Before we start,
let me be blunt.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.401
The only way I see you
getting out

09:31.401 --> 09:32.953
is if you admit guilt.

09:32.953 --> 09:35.786
I don't care if it's not true,
if it was an accident.

09:35.786 --> 09:37.618
You got to say
you did it on purpose.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.369
Do I need
to repeat myself?

09:39.369 --> 09:42.202
No, it's just
you're not what I expected.

09:42.202 --> 09:43.503
What does that mean?

09:43.503 --> 09:46.046
Your husband's
kind of vanilla.

09:46.046 --> 09:47.047
And...?

09:47.047 --> 09:48.759
You seem
the opposite of vanilla.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.300
Neither of us
are vanilla.

09:50.300 --> 09:51.762
-You guys got kids?
-Trying.

09:51.762 --> 09:53.343
What's the problem?
His junk not work?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.515
Sexual advance
on a female guard,

09:55.515 --> 09:57.137
inciting a fight
in your cellblock.

09:57.137 --> 09:59.519
Only a moron commits
these kinds of infractions

09:59.519 --> 10:00.981
when you're up for parole.

10:00.981 --> 10:04.484
Or you just don't want out
at all?

10:04.484 --> 10:05.776
Which is it?

10:10.691 --> 10:13.654
I've always been
kind of a moron.

10:32.753 --> 10:34.424
Don't worry.
I'm not looking.

10:34.424 --> 10:36.426
Your phone rang.

10:38.018 --> 10:39.760
Laurel?

10:39.760 --> 10:42.522
No.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.364
You sure
you don't want the ashes?

10:54.364 --> 10:56.156
I mean, we can cook them
into slop,

10:56.156 --> 10:57.117
feed it to pigs,

10:57.117 --> 10:58.238
or just spread them

10:58.238 --> 10:59.950
in the worst place
imaginable.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.491
My sister
might actually take them.

11:01.491 --> 11:02.913
Oh, so your sister
showed up?

11:02.913 --> 11:04.624
Yeah, she's here now.

11:04.624 --> 11:07.047
Oh, then go.
I'll talk to you later.

11:07.047 --> 11:08.338
It's fine.

11:08.338 --> 11:10.460
-How are you?
-Great.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.592
I have the whole house
to myself this weekend.

11:12.592 --> 11:14.594
I'm gonna eat
and watch bad movies.

11:14.594 --> 11:16.256
You still have the list
of AA meetings

11:16.256 --> 11:17.677
I left on your desk?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.469
Bonnie, just go and be
with your sister.

11:19.469 --> 11:21.351
Thanks.

11:30.731 --> 11:32.943
God, grant me the serenity

11:32.943 --> 11:36.406
to accept the things
I cannot change,

11:36.406 --> 11:39.449
courage to change
the things I can,

11:39.449 --> 11:42.452
and wisdom to know
the difference.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.745
Hi, I'm Jonathan.
I'm an alcoholic.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.246
Hi, Jonathan.

11:46.246 --> 11:49.039
Any visitors here
for the first time today?

11:52.793 --> 11:54.424
Hi.

11:54.424 --> 11:57.597
We usually start
by saying our names.

11:57.597 --> 11:58.969
Do I have to?

12:04.184 --> 12:05.435
Annalise.

12:05.435 --> 12:08.188
Hi, Annalise.

12:08.188 --> 12:11.481
Thank you
for joining us today, Annalise.

12:15.986 --> 12:18.488
"Once Middleton was made aware
of the circumstances,

12:18.488 --> 12:20.861
the office of the President
immediately began a review.

12:20.861 --> 12:23.663
As a result, Professor Keating's
duties have been reassigned.

12:23.663 --> 12:25.625
A new instructor
has been assigned

12:25.625 --> 12:27.868
to the Legal Clinic
effective immediately."

12:27.868 --> 12:29.669
Ding-dong,
the bitch is dead.

12:29.669 --> 12:31.081
Can they do this?
Of course.

12:31.081 --> 12:32.422
She pushed too far.

12:32.422 --> 12:34.634
Or they couldn't handle
having a strong woman in power.

12:34.634 --> 12:36.546
Power only works
if you know how to not abuse it.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.378
Okay, we need to storm
the President's office,

12:38.378 --> 12:39.840
do an "Oh, Captain!
My Captain!"

12:39.840 --> 12:41.591
Maybe this just means
we're finally free.

12:41.591 --> 12:42.883
Free of what?

12:42.883 --> 12:44.384
Her.

12:44.384 --> 12:45.765
This is bad, isn't it?

12:45.765 --> 12:48.058
She'll figure something out.
She always does.

12:48.058 --> 12:51.021
I-I could be out of a job,
and I really like this job.

12:51.021 --> 12:51.982
Poor Annalise.

12:55.315 --> 12:57.277
Had to figure I'd run
into someone I know

12:57.277 --> 12:58.448
at one of these
sooner or later.

12:58.448 --> 12:59.950
Professor Erickson?

12:59.950 --> 13:02.402
You think he could do
a better job than me?

13:02.402 --> 13:04.404
I don't think this
is the place to discuss this.

13:04.404 --> 13:05.785
I don't care
what you think.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.747
I'm at this meeting
in order to get my license back.

13:07.747 --> 13:09.789
Is that the only reason
you're here?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.581
I'll sue you.
Remind your board of that.

13:11.581 --> 13:13.463
You think
there's a chance in hell

13:13.463 --> 13:14.584
they would've suspended you

13:14.584 --> 13:16.126
if they thought
you had a legitimate case?

13:17.217 --> 13:18.508
Unbelievable.

13:18.508 --> 13:21.301
You know what?
Stop fighting, Annalise.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.303
It's not cute anymore.

13:25.595 --> 13:26.686
Come home with me.

13:28.638 --> 13:30.140
What?

13:30.140 --> 13:32.392
She needs
to hear you say it --

13:32.392 --> 13:34.855
that Sam forced you
to keep it from her.

13:36.736 --> 13:38.488
I could've told her,
anyway.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.741
You couldn't...

13:44.444 --> 13:48.078
...because Sam
got into your head...

13:48.078 --> 13:50.120
just like he did
to me.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.713
This is a woman
who wants me dead.

13:53.713 --> 13:55.505
Because she blames you
for the baby,

13:55.505 --> 13:57.918
and that's fair.

13:57.918 --> 13:59.669
You know that.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.591
Of course I do.

14:01.591 --> 14:05.595
Then come home
and tell her that.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.968
She'll forgive you.

14:07.968 --> 14:10.931
You just need
to forgive her first.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.336
He was lying to me
in there.

14:36.336 --> 14:37.497
Why? That's your job
to figure out,

14:37.497 --> 14:39.629
but plenty of people
prefer a life on the inside.

14:39.629 --> 14:40.590
Someone feeds you,

14:40.590 --> 14:41.591
tells you where to be
all the time.

14:41.591 --> 14:42.632
Sounds nice to me.

14:42.632 --> 14:43.763
Doesn't make any sense,
though.

14:43.763 --> 14:45.135
And yet,
that's what he's doing.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.266
Commits crimes in jail

14:46.266 --> 14:47.767
so he doesn't have to deal
with the real world.

14:47.767 --> 14:49.769
My job is hard enough
dealing with people

14:49.769 --> 14:51.351
who actually want
to be out.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.063
He wants out.
He's just...

14:53.063 --> 14:55.225
confused.

14:55.225 --> 14:57.277
Come on, tell me you didn't see
what I saw -- the wounded --

14:57.277 --> 14:59.980
I think you saw a boy
in need of a daddy.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.825
That's not fair.

15:05.825 --> 15:07.197
Well, neither is guilting me
into being a mother.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.528
That's not
what this is about.

15:08.528 --> 15:10.030
Everything coming out
of your mouth right now

15:10.030 --> 15:11.291
is about that.

15:11.291 --> 15:12.332
You're reaching,
and you know it.

15:12.332 --> 15:14.664
When's the last time
you touched me?

15:14.664 --> 15:16.796
Ever since I said no
to IVF,

15:16.796 --> 15:18.298
I'm not enough for you --
is that it?

15:18.298 --> 15:19.919
Annie --
You can't stand the idea

15:19.919 --> 15:21.711
of being stuck all alone
in this house with me.

15:21.711 --> 15:25.095
Okay, hey, hey, hey.
Come here. Come here.

15:25.095 --> 15:26.596
Come here.

15:31.051 --> 15:32.892
You're all I need.

15:32.892 --> 15:35.645
And if I haven't made you
feel that way...

15:35.645 --> 15:37.017
I'm sorry.

15:37.017 --> 15:39.269
You...

15:39.269 --> 15:40.520
are enough for me.

on one campus.

17:46.776 --> 17:47.947
The new power couple.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.491
They only hired me
as assistant professor.

17:51.491 --> 17:52.782
Well, for now.

17:52.782 --> 17:54.574
You'll get tenure
in record time,

17:54.574 --> 17:55.695
way before me.

17:55.695 --> 17:58.408
Like that was ever a question.

17:58.408 --> 18:00.910
Wow, someone's getting cocky
pretty fast.

18:00.910 --> 18:03.543

Where is it?

18:53.963 --> 18:55.014
What are you
talking about?

18:55.014 --> 18:56.636
One of you took my laptop.
Give it back.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.847
-Ooh, this is good.
-This isn't funny!

18:57.847 --> 18:59.018
Unwad your panties,
bro.

18:59.018 --> 18:59.929
I went to the bathroom.
It was right there.

18:59.929 --> 19:01.020
I came back,
and it was gone,

19:01.020 --> 19:02.141
and I will call security
if I have to.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.813
-I dare you.
-Ain't afraid of no po-po.

19:03.813 --> 19:06.025
Okay, open your bag then
and prove you don't have it.
Hey!

19:06.025 --> 19:07.437
It is illegal to do
an unlawful search and seizure

19:07.437 --> 19:08.898
of someone's belongings.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.400
This isn't funny.
That computer was expensive

19:10.400 --> 19:11.481
and I don't have money to blow

19:11.481 --> 19:12.612
like the rest
of your spoiled asses.

19:12.612 --> 19:14.484
-Spoiled?
-Oh, you think we don't know

19:14.484 --> 19:15.735
that you're just here
playing at law school

19:15.735 --> 19:16.776
until you can swap
a rich daddy

19:16.776 --> 19:17.447
for a rich husband?

19:17.447 --> 19:18.538
Go anywhere near my bag

19:18.538 --> 19:19.699
or anyone else's
in this room

19:19.699 --> 19:21.080
and your laptop
won't be all you're missing,

19:21.080 --> 19:24.334
you spineless, tiny-balled,
whiny excuse of a man!

19:26.416 --> 19:27.837
Walk away.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.850
So, Wes, where you from?

19:40.850 --> 19:43.603
Ohio originally, but I, uh,
I moved around a lot.

19:43.603 --> 19:44.644
Oh. Army brat?

19:44.644 --> 19:46.105
Uh, Dad, can you just
let him eat?

19:46.105 --> 19:48.518
This is not
an interrogation.

19:48.518 --> 19:50.270
All right,
maybe just a little bit.

19:50.270 --> 19:53.072
I get it.
But, no, not an Army brat.

19:53.072 --> 19:55.074
So, what do
your parents do?
Dad.

19:55.074 --> 19:57.487
How is that
not a fair question?

19:58.988 --> 20:02.782
Wes' mom died of cancer
and he never met his father.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.458
I apologize.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.829
It was
a really long time ago.

20:09.829 --> 20:10.750
What kind of cancer?

20:10.750 --> 20:12.332
Oh, my God.

20:12.332 --> 20:14.334
I'm just trying to bond
with the boy, Meggy.

20:14.334 --> 20:16.546
It's okay. Stomach.

I knew
you weren't gonna pick up.

21:21.030 --> 21:27.667
But I was calling to say
you're lucky I sent you away

21:27.667 --> 21:31.621
because now you don't have
to deal with this mess anymore,

21:31.621 --> 21:34.624
and I got a lot of it.

21:34.624 --> 21:36.966
Like I need to tell you.

21:36.966 --> 21:39.048
Um.

I can't go back.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.247
Even if she says
she'll forgive me,

22:08.247 --> 22:09.999
she can't.

22:09.999 --> 22:12.372
And maybe
I don't have to go back.

22:12.372 --> 22:15.915
Maybe neither of us do.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.959
Run away with me.

22:22.131 --> 22:25.465
You're not happy in that house.
Nobody ever is.

22:25.465 --> 22:31.060
But you...out of all of us
deserve to be.

22:31.060 --> 22:34.103
Find some boring town.

22:34.103 --> 22:35.895
Get normal jobs.

22:38.608 --> 22:41.651
Make a family.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.743
We'd have cute babies, no?

22:53.793 --> 22:55.665
I'm only teasing.

22:58.838 --> 23:01.130
You mind
if I turn on the TV?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.635
Go ahead.

23:05.635 --> 23:06.716
Everything

23:06.716 --> 23:08.848
you know, life escalates.

23:08.848 --> 23:11.511
But when you're young,
love, life is very complicated.

23:15.394 --> 23:16.726
My wife's a hard sell,
Frank,

23:16.726 --> 23:18.067
but her bull detector's
pretty good.

23:18.067 --> 23:19.819
But I think I can get her back
to your side.

23:19.819 --> 23:21.400
Yeah, you did your best.
Don't worry about it.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.443
I do worry, though.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.618
You're scared to get out.

23:28.618 --> 23:30.740
No, that's stupid.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.411
Then why do you keep screwing up
in here?

23:32.411 --> 23:37.537
Because the only reason
I can think of

23:37.537 --> 23:39.499
is that you can't forgive
yourself for what you did.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.252
It was an accident, Frank.

23:47.597 --> 23:50.810
My parents tell you that?

23:50.810 --> 23:53.392
"No way he could've pulled that
lever himself."

23:58.397 --> 24:01.941
He took the TV
out of my room...

24:01.941 --> 24:05.485
yelled at me when I didn't
help out around the house,

24:05.485 --> 24:08.948
as a dad should do.

24:08.948 --> 24:14.073
And still, I thought it was
worth killing the guy over.

24:14.073 --> 24:15.575
You were 13.

24:15.575 --> 24:16.876
You didn't know
what you were doing.

24:16.876 --> 24:20.209
I planned it for weeks.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.291
Waited for
the perfect moment.

24:22.291 --> 24:24.213
Looked forward to it.

24:24.213 --> 24:27.296
And when it was over
and he was under that car,

24:27.296 --> 24:32.141
screaming like an animal
in a trap,

24:32.141 --> 24:37.597
my only thought was,
"You idiot, Frank.

24:37.597 --> 24:41.811
You couldn't even kill him
right."

24:41.811 --> 24:46.235
Now tell me
I should get out of here.

24:48.317 --> 24:49.779
You should.

24:49.779 --> 24:53.202
Then you're even more
of a sociopath than I am.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.995
Sociopaths don't cry
over what they did, Frank.

24:58.377 --> 25:00.169
Hey.

25:00.169 --> 25:04.884
You have good in you. Okay?
Just like all of us.

25:04.884 --> 25:08.628
And I'm here
to finally help you see that.

25:08.628 --> 25:10.760
You have good in you.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.196
Wake up.

25:28.988 --> 25:31.280
Sorry.

25:31.280 --> 25:35.074
It's okay.

25:35.074 --> 25:37.116
Your dad?

25:49.799 --> 25:53.222
How about Oregon?

25:53.222 --> 25:58.598
They have these beach towns
with giant sand dunes and trees,

25:58.598 --> 26:00.980
and it rains a lot, too,

26:00.980 --> 26:05.564
so we won't feel bad
if we stay inside all the time.

26:05.564 --> 26:10.820
And when it's nice,
we can go for hikes.

26:10.820 --> 26:12.531
Can't imagine you on a hike.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.694
That's the point.

26:16.906 --> 26:19.458
We'd do things
that make us forget.

27:26.435 --> 27:27.897
...but
the 4th Circuit's opinion found

27:27.897 --> 27:30.359
Rule 17-A applies
to only those asserting a claim,

27:30.359 --> 27:32.231
that people can sue
whoever they want,

27:32.231 --> 27:35.324
so why did the Supreme Court
find in favor of the respondent

27:35.324 --> 27:37.446
in Vaden v. Discover Bank?

27:37.446 --> 27:40.159
Castillo.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.911
What was the question?

27:41.911 --> 27:43.703
Ms. Vaden failed
to disprove the presumption

27:43.703 --> 27:45.995
that she received a binding
arbitration clause in the mail,

27:45.995 --> 27:47.586
and therefore agreed
to the contract.

27:47.586 --> 27:48.788
Now say it
with a Southern twang.

27:48.788 --> 27:50.169
What are you talking about?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.791
Your hillbilly came out when
you were bitching out Simon.

27:51.791 --> 27:53.212
It did not.
It did.

27:53.212 --> 27:54.253
It was pretty thick.

27:54.253 --> 27:55.755
It happens in sex sometimes,
too, P.S.

27:55.755 --> 27:56.716
So, I can never quite
put my finger on it.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.007
It's like a cross between,
like,

27:58.007 --> 27:59.598
Louisiana alligator wrestling

27:59.598 --> 28:01.180

Oh, we are consenting

29:29.478 --> 29:31.480

29:31.480 --> 29:33.893

Oh, let's be clear --
I'm no Annalise Keating.

29:37.396 --> 29:40.699
You heard that woman's calling
herself an alcoholic now, right?

29:40.699 --> 29:44.163
That's how she's getting out
of her suspension.

29:44.163 --> 29:46.575
It'll probably work, too.

29:46.575 --> 29:48.868
That's how life rolls
for that woman.

29:48.868 --> 29:51.911
The lady's got nine lives.

29:53.122 --> 29:54.503
You got to see this.

29:54.503 --> 29:55.504
What are you doing here?

29:55.504 --> 29:57.586
I asked Oliver for a favor.

29:57.586 --> 29:59.798
What kind of favor?
I hacked Simon's laptop.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.971
You stole his computer?
Nope, that was me.

30:01.971 --> 30:03.342
Michaela.
You're insane.

30:03.342 --> 30:04.723
Who are you? Seriously.

30:04.723 --> 30:05.925
You some sort of hillbilly
klepto all of a sudden?

30:05.925 --> 30:06.886
Okay, you're all gonna be happy
I did this

30:06.886 --> 30:08.307
when we get
his arbitration outline.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.889
Couldn't find the outline.
Check again.

30:09.889 --> 30:11.690
I found something better.

30:13.772 --> 30:14.854
Oh, my God.
What the --

30:14.854 --> 30:16.605
I knew it.

30:25.114 --> 30:27.446
Here.

30:35.624 --> 30:37.506

30:39.919 --> 30:41.460
Listen.

30:46.675 --> 30:50.389
So much for
that 100% Indian hair.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.818
Go!

30:59.818 --> 31:01.030
Go away.

31:01.030 --> 31:02.861

31:02.861 --> 31:03.862

31:03.862 --> 31:06.695

31:06.695 --> 31:09.488
I'm disgusting.
No. Here.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.994
You shot me.

31:14.994 --> 31:17.086
You wanted me dead.

31:18.707 --> 31:20.879
I saw it in your eyes.
You hate me.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.131
You hate me.

31:22.131 --> 31:24.133
That's not true.

31:24.133 --> 31:25.804
You protect me.

31:25.804 --> 31:28.307
And I just want to do
the same for you.

31:29.428 --> 31:30.930
Ohh.

31:39.018 --> 31:41.860
How's -- How's Meggy?

31:41.860 --> 31:45.284
Huh? Huh?

31:45.284 --> 31:46.785
Is she good to you?

31:48.487 --> 31:50.079
Very.

31:50.079 --> 31:51.450
Oh.

31:51.450 --> 31:53.582
Too good?

31:55.124 --> 31:58.707
'Cause Nate's too good
to me.

31:58.707 --> 32:01.130
I tried to be okay with it.

32:03.502 --> 32:04.883
I really did.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.755
I really did.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.264
No.

32:32.331 --> 32:34.833
You need some water?

32:49.428 --> 32:51.050
Parole cases
are time-consuming and tedious,

32:51.050 --> 32:52.551
but my husband seems to like you
for some reason,

32:52.551 --> 32:54.263
and I tend to think
that my husband has good taste.

32:54.263 --> 32:56.055
He picked me, after all.

32:56.055 --> 32:58.307
So, if I help you,
you can't lie to me again.

32:58.307 --> 33:00.599
Understood?
Yeah.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.024
Okay, you got yourself
a lawyer.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.945
Now, we need to go over
the details

33:06.945 --> 33:09.448
of what happened
to your father, all right?

33:09.448 --> 33:12.071
I got the police report
right here.

33:12.071 --> 33:14.743
I need to...

33:18.747 --> 33:19.918
You okay?

33:24.543 --> 33:27.296
You need to tell me
your side of the story.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.548
Spare no details.

33:39.308 --> 33:41.350
You pregnant or something?

33:44.563 --> 33:46.355
Boy, right?
How'd you know?

33:47.946 --> 33:49.448
Don't marry a lawyer.

33:51.150 --> 33:53.452
Take him!

33:58.827 --> 34:00.209
I just had a feeling it was him.

34:00.209 --> 34:01.920
He's always so aggro
about you

34:01.920 --> 34:03.122
and that he's never gotten
to be first chair,

34:03.122 --> 34:04.753
and -- and with your job
on the line,

34:04.753 --> 34:07.626
I just thought maybe I should
just look through his computer.

34:07.626 --> 34:09.878
She stole his computer
for the arbitration outline.

34:09.878 --> 34:11.880
We can't give it to
the university, though, right?

34:11.880 --> 34:13.262
Otherwise they'll know
that Michaela stole it.

34:13.262 --> 34:14.473
I can lie, say I found it
somewhere in the quad.

34:14.473 --> 34:16.014
No one's ever gonna believe
that.

34:16.014 --> 34:19.438
No one has to lie.
I'm not gonna show it to anyone.

34:19.438 --> 34:20.889
You're just gonna let him
get away with this?

34:20.889 --> 34:23.642
I didn't say that.
Go and prep for your exam.

34:23.642 --> 34:24.733
What are you gonna do?
Make that weenball pay.

34:24.733 --> 34:27.646
Honestly, you sure?
Yeah.

34:27.646 --> 34:29.608
I mean, the D.A.'s office
could've put these up

34:29.608 --> 34:30.779
or anyone who knows
what we've done,

34:30.779 --> 34:31.950
but it wasn't any of them.

34:31.950 --> 34:34.743
It was just some sad,
pathetic lost boy.

34:34.743 --> 34:38.537
We're safe.
We're still safe.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.469
Mind if I come in?
What's going on?

34:50.469 --> 34:51.970
Stop!
What are you doing here?

34:51.970 --> 34:53.512
I came to return this.

34:55.844 --> 34:58.307
Somebody put that there,
planted it.

34:58.307 --> 34:59.428
Don't lie to me!

35:01.850 --> 35:03.892
Slander, defamation,

35:03.892 --> 35:06.064
hate crime if you want
to bring race into it,

35:06.064 --> 35:09.488
and it all leads to your
expulsion or worse -- prison!

35:12.821 --> 35:13.862
What are you gonna do?

35:16.195 --> 35:17.786
That's up to you.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.501
Mr. Gibbins,
give us an example

35:22.501 --> 35:25.584
of procedural versus
substantive unconscionability.

35:25.584 --> 35:28.667
Uh...it was
unconscionable 'cause --

35:28.667 --> 35:30.709
Wrong. Mr. Millstone?

35:30.709 --> 35:32.211
I object, Your Honor.

35:32.211 --> 35:34.092
I object to the question,
I object to your tone,

35:34.092 --> 35:35.554
and I object
that we don't have

35:35.554 --> 35:37.135
a cool pitcher of
sweet, home-brewed lemonade

35:37.135 --> 35:38.807
to get us through
these proceedings.
Are you done?

35:38.807 --> 35:40.599
Do you think
it's more of, like, a --

35:40.599 --> 35:44.062
like a Beyoncé Southern
or a "Deliverance" Southern?

35:44.062 --> 35:45.684
- We have an exam tomorrow.
- Come on,

35:45.684 --> 35:46.765
just tell us
where your accent's from.

35:46.765 --> 35:48.146
Is it your birth parents
or adopted parents?

35:48.146 --> 35:49.398
It's none of your business.

35:49.398 --> 35:50.819
Uh, we're boning.
I think it's my business.

35:50.819 --> 35:52.611
The people who raised me
are trash.

35:52.611 --> 35:54.072
I am who I am
not because of them

35:54.072 --> 35:55.484
but in spite of them.

35:55.484 --> 35:57.155
They are not worth my breath
or time,

35:57.155 --> 35:58.487
especially when
we have an exam,

35:58.487 --> 36:00.279
so let's never speak
of them again

36:00.279 --> 36:02.411
or I'll cut you all
into little pieces.

36:02.411 --> 36:03.542
Hey.

36:05.374 --> 36:06.875
It's the arbitration outline.

36:08.837 --> 36:10.549
We good now?

36:12.551 --> 36:14.503
What the hell
just happened?

36:14.503 --> 36:16.505
I don't know.
Does it matter?

36:16.505 --> 36:18.467
I'm gonna go make copies.

36:35.904 --> 36:37.576
What's wrong?

36:39.778 --> 36:42.491
I need to break up
with Meggy.

36:45.584 --> 36:47.496
Dinner with her dad
went that well?

36:55.834 --> 36:57.596
I'm sick of lying to her.

37:01.640 --> 37:04.643
Think I should stay
with her?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.437
No. Do what you want.

37:10.939 --> 37:13.111
We're all so messed up.

37:15.193 --> 37:17.406
Annalise, especially.

37:19.858 --> 37:21.660
But you...

37:25.414 --> 37:28.166
I'll break up with Meggy.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.828
Frank's gone.

37:32.331 --> 37:35.464
Frank isn't gone.

37:50.979 --> 37:53.021
Frank?

38:26.515 --> 38:28.136
Hi.

38:28.136 --> 38:30.268
I wanted you and your board
to have a chance

38:30.268 --> 38:32.851
to review my lawsuit
before I file.

38:32.851 --> 38:35.644
Retaliation by the university
for speaking my mind,

38:35.644 --> 38:37.436
gender, race,
age discrimination,

38:37.436 --> 38:38.817
a hostile work environment,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.439
wanton breach of contract,
neglect.

38:40.439 --> 38:43.151
Neglect?
The fliers.

38:43.151 --> 38:45.203
It's been weeks, and your
investigation has found nothing.

38:45.203 --> 38:47.826
Instead, you've devoted
university resources

38:47.826 --> 38:49.207
to having me disbarred,

38:49.207 --> 38:52.040
the legality of which is
questionable in its own right.

38:52.040 --> 38:53.372
$50 million?

38:53.372 --> 38:55.504
Go big or go home.

39:01.670 --> 39:03.051
What do you want?

39:03.051 --> 39:05.554
A truce.
Reverse my suspension.

39:05.554 --> 39:07.305
I go back to teaching
the clinic.

39:07.305 --> 39:08.807
You still don't have
your license --
That's being taken care of.

39:08.807 --> 39:10.469
Because you went
to one AA meeting?

39:10.469 --> 39:11.970
This is not up
for negotiation.

39:11.970 --> 39:13.392
Either give me
what I want

39:13.392 --> 39:16.234
or wake up tomorrow to a lawsuit
that will color the entirety

39:16.234 --> 39:18.356
of your short run
as university president.

39:21.480 --> 39:23.942
Fine, I'll make the calls
right now.

39:23.942 --> 39:25.243
Thank you.

39:27.035 --> 39:29.117
Annalise.

39:31.199 --> 39:34.042
How are you? Really.

39:39.207 --> 39:43.422
You can't get better alone.

39:43.422 --> 39:47.095
Believe me, I've tried...

39:47.095 --> 39:49.638
and failed enough times
to know.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.644
Make those calls.

40:00.649 --> 40:03.321
Stop, please.
At least let me warn Bonnie.

40:03.321 --> 40:05.283
Bonnie lied.
Fine, then you tell her.

40:05.283 --> 40:07.786
I just -- I can't.

40:07.786 --> 40:11.700
Oh, I'm not in the mood
to see your needy faces.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.081
Laurel needs to tell you
something.

40:13.081 --> 40:14.743
She can't speak
for herself?

40:14.743 --> 40:16.705
That's not the Laurel I know,
letting a man speak for her.

40:16.705 --> 40:17.706
Please just listen.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.247
All right.

40:19.247 --> 40:21.169
Fine. What?

40:24.422 --> 40:25.714
Say something.

40:27.095 --> 40:28.216
It's about Frank.

40:29.808 --> 40:31.550
What?

40:31.550 --> 40:33.141
He's in Coalport
with Bonnie.

40:35.223 --> 40:37.015
He called me
when I was with my dad,

40:37.015 --> 40:38.767
and he told me
that you tried to kill him.

40:38.767 --> 40:41.149
Is it true? Did you?
Is that true?

40:41.149 --> 40:43.522
Can you tell us the truth
for once?

40:43.522 --> 40:45.113
Laurel.

40:53.702 --> 40:56.374
I'm here.

40:56.374 --> 40:58.416
I know. I'm on it.

40:58.416 --> 41:00.248
Please try to trust me.

41:03.171 --> 41:05.544
Laurel's pregnant.

41:07.005 --> 41:09.217
I had no idea.

41:09.217 --> 41:10.639
Just stay here, okay?

41:10.639 --> 41:12.470
I promise
I'll keep you updated.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.553
I'll be right back.
Okay.

41:26.865 --> 41:28.567
Pick up.
Please pick up.

41:28.567 --> 41:30.278
Please pick up, please pick up,
please pick up.

41:30.278 --> 41:33.071
This is Connor.
You should text me.

41:38.326 --> 41:39.377
Connor, pick up, please.

41:40.749 --> 41:42.581
Please pick --
Hello?

41:42.581 --> 41:44.543
Who's this?
Trishelle. Who's this?

41:44.543 --> 41:46.464
Oliver. Were --

41:46.464 --> 41:48.216
I'm looking for Connor Walsh.

41:48.216 --> 41:49.718
Is that
whose phone this is?

41:49.718 --> 41:51.509
I just found it
in my daughter's sofa cushions.

41:51.509 --> 41:53.431
Darn thing was vibrating
my booty.

41:53.431 --> 41:54.893
Mom!

41:54.893 --> 41:57.015
Someone named Oliver
looking for Connor.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.436
I don't know where he is,
Oliver.

41:58.436 --> 42:00.018
Are you sure?
Yeah, what's wrong?

42:00.018 --> 42:01.900
You haven't heard?
Heard what?

42:01.900 --> 42:04.402
Annalise's house burned down.
The cops arrested her.

42:04.402 --> 42:05.604
Laurel was inside,
but they found her.

42:05.604 --> 42:06.905
What?

42:06.905 --> 42:09.487
She's pregnant, Michaela.

42:09.487 --> 42:11.069
Laurel.

42:11.069 --> 42:12.360
Did she tell you?
