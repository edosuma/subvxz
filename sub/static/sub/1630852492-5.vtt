window rolled down,

about this book?

08:45.559 --> 08:46.691

companies were in your book,

I took action.

confidentiality.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.475

10:44.511 --> 10:46.277

Horrible prank, goddamn--

17:06.226 --> 17:08.726
Don't laugh!
(laughs)

17:08.728 --> 17:10.994
How did you even--ohhh!

17:11.031 --> 17:12.663
You're evil.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.499
Why is it so loud?
Can you turn the horns down?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.334
- Oh, sorry.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.270
It's my favourite song.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.238
- This one?
- Mm-hmm.

17:21.274 --> 17:23.207
- Cool!
- Right?

17:23.209 --> 17:25.209
- I didn't realize you were
back from your grand adventure

17:25.211 --> 17:26.844
With val's boys.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.679
- Yeah, I'd like to never
see them again.

17:28.681 --> 17:31.014
- Was it that bad?
Anything to report?

17:31.051 --> 17:34.552
- No, um, nothing-nothing
to report, really, no.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.220
Not at--uh, nope.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.122
- What are you...

17:38.257 --> 17:40.524
Nathan, what's going on?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.461
Come on.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.863
Jacob and joseph got me high.
Like, for the first time.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.165
And I'm kinda freaking out
right now,

17:47.300 --> 17:49.066
So if I'm acting weird,

17:49.069 --> 17:50.168
That would be why I'm acting
weird, okay?

17:50.303 --> 17:52.035
- Okay.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.038
First of all, you're safe.
Hey, look at me.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.706
You're fine, you're safe,
okay?

17:55.775 --> 17:58.242
And thank you for sharing
with me, very big boy of you.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.478
- That's good to hear.
I'm tired.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.180
- No, but tell me about it
though, like,

18:02.315 --> 18:04.515
What did you guys do?
What'd you get up to?

18:04.551 --> 18:07.118
- Okay, real quick, I guess.

18:07.120 --> 18:08.919
Jacob and joseph are insane.

18:08.988 --> 18:10.655
Like, I hate them.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.590
But they definitely know
who they are,

18:12.659 --> 18:14.458
Which is kinda cool,

18:14.494 --> 18:16.460
And they encouraged me
to be who I am,

18:16.463 --> 18:18.162
Which is also cool.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.997
- That is cool.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.466
- Yeah, I'm a jazz boy,
and that's just who I am.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.735
- You're absolutely right,
you're a jazz boy,

18:24.737 --> 18:26.270
And how cool is that?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.539
I'm sorry I was pushing you
to be anything but that.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.174
(sighs)

18:30.309 --> 18:33.744
This song's actually not bad,
I kinda like it.

18:33.746 --> 18:35.879
I mean, the beat, the way
it kinda sneaks up on you,

18:35.915 --> 18:37.348
Just like, wow!
- Aaah!

18:37.417 --> 18:39.216
- Oh no, I'm sorry!
Was it that hard?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.885
What is it?

18:40.954 --> 18:42.353
- Please promise you're not
gonna freak out.

18:45.324 --> 18:47.424
- Oh god.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.028
What the hell is that?

18:51.164 --> 18:53.564
- Jacob and joseph made me
get a tattoo.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.433
- They did what?!

18:55.568 --> 18:57.368
(sighs)

18:58.438 --> 19:00.437
Okay.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.072
What'd you get?

19:05.145 --> 19:07.445
Ji-jizz boy?
- Jazz boy!

19:07.580 --> 19:09.580
- Jazz boy!
- Okay, I-I...

19:09.649 --> 19:11.114
I kinda see it.

19:11.151 --> 19:14.185
I-I wish his legs were...
Further apart.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.520
- Like I said,
I'm-I'm a jazz boy!

19:16.523 --> 19:19.323
And it's inside me,
and it needs to come out.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.991
- Oh boy.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.894
- I'm wanna spread it around,
and put it in people's ears.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.761
- You should stop.
- I'm like a jazz addict!

19:24.797 --> 19:27.131
- That is... Holy.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.867
Okay, uh, for now why don't
you promise me you're not

19:30.904 --> 19:33.003
Gonna share it with that girl
you're trying to impr--

<i> (thud, clatter)</i>

19:38.077 --> 19:40.177
You've got your crush up here
this whole time?

19:40.180 --> 19:42.647
It looks like you did get into
trouble with those boys!

19:42.649 --> 19:45.015
This is good! But she doesn't
have to hide.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.684
I'm cool--
why am I whispering?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.753
Hey, sweetheart, get out here!

19:48.888 --> 19:50.888
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh no! Please, no--

19:50.890 --> 19:52.889
- What? I--

19:52.926 --> 19:54.759
- Hi.
- Oh!

19:54.894 --> 19:57.495
Oh. Okay.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.263
- Please don't tell dad.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.499
- I-I won't.

20:01.634 --> 20:03.701
Hi, I'm gonna go.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.569
Lot of information.
All of it fine.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.438
Love is love.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.306
But news, nonetheless.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.509
But... Great stuff.

20:12.579 --> 20:14.445
I gotta wash these slippers!
- Wait, what?

20:14.580 --> 20:16.180
- They're full of honey.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.582
Bye guys, you uh...

Yeah.
