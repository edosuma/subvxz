09:33.490 --> 09:35.158
AND SINCE SHE'S
UNDER HOUSE ARREST,

09:35.158 --> 09:36.493
THAT'S KIND OF A PROBLEM.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.829
- OUCH.
BUT THERE'S NOT REALLY

09:38.829 --> 09:40.455
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO,
IS THERE?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.833
- UH, MAKE SOME CALLS,
UH, TRY TO FIGURE OUT

09:42.833 --> 09:44.584
WHERE SHE IS, UH--

09:44.584 --> 09:45.961
YEAH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT WE CAN DO.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.963
- WELL, ARE YOU ABLE
TO STAY FOCUSED

09:47.963 --> 09:52.677
ON YOUR EXAMS?
- YES, I AM FOCUSED.

09:52.677 --> 09:53.802
WHAT'S THIS?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.846
- A LAMINATED SCHEDULE
OF YOUR MIDTERMS

09:55.846 --> 09:57.597
AND A SLIDING SCALE
OF THE SCORES YOU NEED

09:57.597 --> 09:58.682
TO GET A "B"
AND KEEP YOUR SCHOLARSHIP.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.810
- HOLY SHIT.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.770
- WELL, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.731
MAYBE WE'LL 69.

10:05.731 --> 10:09.317
- UH, LOOK, CAN HE HEAR US?

10:09.317 --> 10:11.236
- HEY, KUZNER, YOU HEAR WHAT
I SAID TO LIP

10:11.236 --> 10:14.239
ABOUT SITTING ON HIS FACE
WHILE I BOB FOR KNOB?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.949
HE CAN'T HEAR US.

10:15.949 --> 10:19.703
- UM, OKAY,
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER, YEAH?

10:19.703 --> 10:21.747
[door opens, closes]

10:21.747 --> 10:24.750
- I CAN HEAR.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.719
- OH, SWEETIE, THAT'S--
THAT'S CANDY

10:34.719 --> 10:36.219
FOR THE GIFT BAGS
FOR THE WEDDING.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.555
- CAN I HAVE CANDY?
- SWEETIE, LET MOMMY DO

10:38.555 --> 10:39.765
HER DRUG DEAL, HONEY.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.433
- WE GOT VICODIN...
- UH-HUH?

10:41.433 --> 10:44.186
- DILAUDID, AND DURAGESIC.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.730
- LIQUID MORPHINE?
- TWO HUNDY.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.355
- OXYS?
- 20 EACH.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.107
- CODEINE?
DAD'S LIVER'S FAILING.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.525
HE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.194
- THAT'S GONNA COST
ABOUT 25 GRAND.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.613
- FOR CODEINE?
- FOR A NEW LIVER.

10:54.613 --> 10:56.406
WHAT--ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU JUST SAID?

10:56.406 --> 10:58.575
- W-WAIT, WAIT.
I'M CONFUSED.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.368
YOU DO LIVER TRANSPLANTS?

11:00.368 --> 11:02.454
- NO. NO, NO, NO.
BUT I KNOW A GUY.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.122
KIND OF WORKS
ON THE DOWN-LOW.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.333
- I-I-I WA--
I WA--I'M SORRY.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.043
I WAS JUST EAVESDROPPING.
- MM-HMM?

11:08.043 --> 11:11.839
- DID YOU JUST SAY
THAT YOU DO A LIVER

11:11.839 --> 11:15.008
AND A TRANSPLANT
FOR $25,000?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.968
- SURE, LAST I CHECKED.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.221
BUT YOU DO HAVE
MEDICAL RECORDS, RIGHT?

11:19.221 --> 11:22.808
MY BOY NEEDS THAT
TO FIND A MATCH.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.684
- WE CAN BUY FRANK A LIVER!

11:24.684 --> 11:26.394
- GIVE US A SEC.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.772
- [whispering]
I HAVE--

11:27.772 --> 11:28.980
A LITTLE MONEY SAVED.
- YEAH.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.732
- AND YOU HAD TO HAVE MADE
SOME MONEY

11:30.732 --> 11:32.442
FROM SELLING OFF
MY FURNITURE.

11:32.442 --> 11:33.985
I MEAN, THAT WAS COVERED
IN PLASTIC...

11:33.985 --> 11:35.445
- OKAY.
- AND PRISTINE.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.114
- OKAY, BUT BEFORE WE GET
TOO EXCITED,

11:37.114 --> 11:38.907
A TRANSPLANT--THAT'S A MAJOR
MEDICAL PROCEDURE.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.575
- YES.
- THIS GUY IS A DEALER

11:40.575 --> 11:43.620
I MET IN A PARKING LOT
AFTER A PHISH CONCERT.

11:48.583 --> 11:49.919
OKAY.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.837
- DID HE SELL YOU BAD DRUGS?

11:51.837 --> 11:54.422
- NO.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.968
- HE'S A PEAR FARMER.
- WHAT?

11:57.968 --> 12:00.512
- AVERY, OUR FRIEND
IN WISCONSIN.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.181
HIS FARM IS TOTALLY ORGANIC.

12:03.181 --> 12:06.643
COMPOST, NATURAL BUG REPELLENT.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.979
WE ALL TAKE SHIFTS,
AND DURING HARVEST SEASON, WE--

12:08.979 --> 12:11.189
- DUDE, WHAT, UH, WHAT IS THIS?
[beeping]

12:11.189 --> 12:13.358
HUH? IS THIS AN ANKLE MONITOR?

12:13.358 --> 12:15.944
- HERS.
- HUH? WHAT?

12:15.944 --> 12:18.029
- IT'S BEEPING, DUDE.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.407
THAT MEANS THE COPS ARE GONNA
COME LOOKING FOR IT.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.992
- SO WHY ARE YOU STILL
HOLDING IT?

12:21.992 --> 12:24.619
- CHUCK IT OUTSIDE.
- DO YOU THINK IT'S GOT GPS?

12:24.619 --> 12:27.873
- AT NIGHT, YOU LOOK UP
AND CAN SEE THE MILKY WAY,

12:27.873 --> 12:32.169
AND IT'S ALL WHITE AND...
MILKY, HEE-HEE.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.004
- MM-HMM.

12:34.004 --> 12:35.840
- HEY.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.925
HEY, HOW ABOUT THAT ECSTASY?

12:37.925 --> 12:39.718
- NO, THANKS.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.803
- YOU ALREADY TOOK IT.

12:41.803 --> 12:45.015
IT FEELS NICE, RIGHT?

12:45.015 --> 12:47.893
[laughs]

12:47.893 --> 12:49.644
- YOU WERE QUIET TODAY
IN DETENTION.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.771
- I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.106
- OKAY.

12:53.106 --> 12:56.651
- MY DAD'S DYING.
- OH.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.236
IS THAT A GOOD THING
OR A BAD THING?

12:58.236 --> 13:00.030
- MOSTLY BAD.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.366
- WELL, LET'S DO SOMETHING
TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF OF IT.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.369
- LIKE WHAT?

13:12.375 --> 13:15.712
WHOA!

13:15.712 --> 13:18.841
- THIS IS A '99 FORD CONTOUR.
THEY'RE PRETTY EASY.

13:18.841 --> 13:20.091
- ARE WE STEALING IT?
- JUST HAVE TO EXPOSE

13:20.091 --> 13:22.219
THE IGNITION CYLINDER,
CROSS SOME WIRES.

13:22.219 --> 13:25.222
- CAN YOU TEACH ME?
- GET IN.

13:29.768 --> 13:33.939
- OH, LORD.
OH, HOW WONDERFUL.

13:33.939 --> 13:35.148
- READY TO MEET
YOUR SISTER NIECES?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.858
THEY'VE BEEN ASKING
ABOUT YOU.

13:36.858 --> 13:38.318
- OH--MMPH.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.111
OOH, AREN'T THEY PERFECT?

13:40.111 --> 13:41.906

JUST LEFT 'EM HERE,

13:41.906 --> 13:43.657
LIKE WE KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
WE'RE DOING.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.909
THIS IS AMY,
AND THAT'S JEMMA.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.912
KEV WANTED TO NAME HER
ZANIQUA.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.538
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
ONE PSEUDO-AFRICAN NAME,

13:50.538 --> 13:51.957
ONE NORMAL ONE.
[cell phone jingles]

13:51.957 --> 13:54.834
- BABE, CHECK THAT.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.170
- NO, IT'S JUST KATE SAYING
CONGRATULATIONS.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.755
- WELL, WHAT--
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.215
- FIONA NEVER SHOWED UP,

14:00.215 --> 14:01.549
AND THEN KEV CALLED LIP,
AND HE SAID

14:01.549 --> 14:02.968
SHE NEVER CAME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.261
YOU KNOW SHE'S
UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.845
- OH, THAT'S NOT GOOD.
- YOU KNOW,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.973
I GOTTA GO PICK UP BABY WIPES
AND RASH CREAM.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.934
YEAH, I'LL GO ASK AROUND,
SEE WHAT'S UP WITH FIONA.

14:09.934 --> 14:11.351

14:11.351 --> 14:12.978
- AND I'LL STOP
BY THE ALIBI TOO.

14:12.978 --> 14:14.312
- ALL RIGHT, NOW,
UH, TELL ME AGAIN.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.732
UM, THIS ONE'S AMY.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.902
- UH, I THINK SO.
I MEAN, I KNOW THEIR NAMES.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.656
I'M JUST NOT 100% YET
ON WHICH ONE IS WHICH.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.034
- WE CALLED THESE HOSPITALS,
BUT THEY ALL SAID

14:28.034 --> 14:29.911
FIONA'S NOT
A REGISTERED PATIENT,

14:29.911 --> 14:32.080
BUT IF SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS,
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE HER NAME.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.915
- YOU THINK SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS?
- NO.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.418
I DON'T KNOW, JUST CALL
AND TELL THEM YOU NEED TO LOOK

14:36.418 --> 14:37.919

YESTERDAY WHO MATCH

14:37.919 --> 14:40.338
FIONA'S DESCRIPTION.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.756
- I MIGHT NOT REMEMBER
ALL THAT.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.342
- WELL, THAT'S WHY
I WROTE IT DOWN.

14:44.342 --> 14:46.136
- COOL, I GOTTA GO.
BONNIE'S WAITING.

14:46.136 --> 14:47.929
- YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN GET
TO FIVE HOSPITALS?

14:47.929 --> 14:50.807
- SHE DRIVES FAST.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.143
- HEY, DOES THIS LOOK OKAY?

14:53.143 --> 14:55.353
- HOW DID YOU DO THAT?
- COVER-UP.

14:55.353 --> 14:59.357
LIVING WITH TERRY
BROUGHT OUT THE ARTIST IN ME.

14:59.357 --> 15:00.984

15:03.194 --> 15:05.405
YOU KNOW, SHE'S SORT OF MY,

I DON'T KNOW.

15:08.993 --> 15:11.996
HEY!

15:16.791 --> 15:18.209
- IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
A BOYFRIEND'S BEATEN THE CRAP

15:18.209 --> 15:20.295
OUT OF ME,
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE LAST.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.297
- I'D HOPE SO.
- HOW'S YOUR BOYFRIEND?

15:22.297 --> 15:23.798
- MM, HE'S NOT.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.175
- SORRY, I LOST TRACK.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.010
- I HAVE TOO MUCH TO DO
TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT HIM

15:27.010 --> 15:29.346
OR THE GIRL HE'S SEEING,
SO REALLY, IT'S A GOOD THING.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.140
- THE FIRST GUY
WHO EVEN SLAPS YOU,

15:31.140 --> 15:32.724
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT SHIV
AND JAM IT IN HIS EYE.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.100
DON'T EVEN LET HIM START.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.935
- HMM, LIP TOLD ME TO GO
FOR THE SCROTUM,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.937
BUT THE EYE WORKS TOO.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.481
- DID ANYONE JUST SEE
AN UNDERAGE GIRL

15:39.481 --> 15:42.067
DRIVE OFF IN A BEATER
WITH CARL?

15:42.067 --> 15:44.361
- YEAH, THAT WOULD BE BONNIE.
- WHO THE FUCK'S BONNIE?

15:44.361 --> 15:47.489
HEY. WHAT, UH,
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

15:47.489 --> 15:48.865
- SHE'S STAYING WITH US
BECAUSE KENYATTA--

15:48.865 --> 15:51.076
- YOU CAN SPARE HIM
THE DETAILS.

15:51.076 --> 15:54.079
IT'S TEMPORARY, SO DON'T GET
YOUR FLOWERED PANTIES IN A KNOT.

15:54.079 --> 15:57.040
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR EYE?
- THIS.

15:57.040 --> 16:00.085
- OKAY.
- AH, YOU DROPPING LIAM OFF? HI.

16:00.085 --> 16:01.961
- YEAH, YEAH, I GOT AN EXAM
IN A FEW HOURS.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.923
ANY WORD ON FIONA?
- UH, CARL AND IAN

16:04.923 --> 16:06.591
ARE CHECKING HOSPITALS,
BUT I'LL TRY KEV AGAIN LATER.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.343
- NO, I ALREADY TALKED TO HIM.
HE'S GOT NOTHING.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.969
- DOESN'T FIONA HAVE
AN ANKLE MONITOR?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.262
CAN'T WE JUST CALL
THE PROBATION OFFICER

16:11.262 --> 16:13.015
AND SEE
IF THEY KNOW WHERE SHE IS?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.224
- NO, WE DON'T WANT TO DRAW
THEIR ATTENTION

16:14.224 --> 16:15.767
TO THE FACT
THAT SHE'S GONE AWOL.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.018
- BUT IF SHE'S HURT OR--
OR KIDNAPPED--

16:17.018 --> 16:18.561
- LOOK, IF WE DON'T FIND
HER SOON,

16:18.561 --> 16:20.021
WE'LL CONSIDER THAT OPTION,
OKAY?

16:20.021 --> 16:22.066
- ALL I DO IS LOOK
FOR MY FAMILY.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.358
I'M GETTING ALL OF YOU
ANKLE MONITORS.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.069
- WHAT, LOJACK CHIPS
UNDER THE SKIN?

16:25.069 --> 16:26.694
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.029
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
HERE, YOU GO, BABY.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.198
- WELL, WE WAIT.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.368
HOPE SHE'S OKAY.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.702
HEY, WILL YOU, UH,
MAKE HIM SOME LUNCH?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.162
I NEED TO STUDY.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.455
WANNA GO GET LUNCH?

16:37.455 --> 16:41.918
- THANKS.
- HUNGRY?

16:41.918 --> 16:44.712
OOH, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.923
- WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS AGAIN?

16:46.923 --> 16:49.759
- I PREFER NOT TO USE
MY REAL NAME.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.345
IF YOU LIKE,
YOU CAN CALL ME "JOHNNY."

16:52.345 --> 16:53.930
I'M A TRAINED SURGEON
WITH A MEDICAL DEGREE

16:53.930 --> 16:56.058
FROM CHITTAGONG, BANGLADESH.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.143
I'M JUST NOT LICENSED
IN THIS COUNTRY.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.437
- WELL, AS LONG AS
YOU'RE LICENSED SOMEWHERE.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.981
- WHERE WILL YOU GET
THE LIVER?

17:02.981 --> 17:04.274
- I'VE ALREADY SECURED
A DONOR

17:04.274 --> 17:06.234
BASED ON THE MEDICAL RECORDS
YOU PROVIDED.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.862
I HAVE AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST,
HEPATOLOGIST,

17:08.862 --> 17:10.572
SURGICAL STAFF,

17:10.572 --> 17:12.365
WITH THE NECESSARY EQUIPMENT.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.993
BUT WE WILL NOT OVERSEE
THE PATIENT'S RECOVERY.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.871
AFTER THE TRANSPLANT,
YOU WILL TAKE HIM TO A HOSPITAL.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.205
THE E.R. WILL ADMIT HIM
AT THAT POINT,

17:19.205 --> 17:22.750
REGARDLESS OF HOW HE GOT
THE LIVER.

17:22.750 --> 17:24.544
WHEN DID YOU SAY YOU WANTED
TO DO THE PROCEDURE?

17:24.544 --> 17:27.046
- AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
- O-ONLY NOT TOMORROW,

17:27.046 --> 17:28.840
'CAUSE TOMORROW'S ALREADY
PRETTY FULL.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.050
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.
- OH.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.093
CONGRATULATIONS.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.553
- THANK YOU.
- THE TRANSPLANT

17:33.553 --> 17:36.181
WILL COST 25,000
AMERICAN DOLLARS,

17:36.181 --> 17:38.224
PLUS 5,000 FOR THE LIVER--

17:38.224 --> 17:41.561
30,000 IN TOTAL.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.564
- OH.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.982
UM--

17:45.982 --> 17:48.193
- CAN YOU DO IT
FOR 26,000 TOTAL?

17:48.193 --> 17:51.238
THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT.

18:09.339 --> 18:11.508
- THAT, UH, THAT'S WHAT WE--

18:11.508 --> 18:16.346
