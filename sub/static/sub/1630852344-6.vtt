WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:23.398


00:23.481 --> 00:28.153
Now you've given me the master code to all
your agency's resources around the world,

00:28.236 --> 00:30.530
I can proceed with my planned destruction.

00:30.613 --> 00:32.449
You're not getting out of here!

00:33.033 --> 00:34.034


00:34.117 --> 00:37.954
I have more work to do, Tony.
But you are no longer useful to me.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.416
Who are you? And why would you
lead us on a chase all over Europe

00:41.499 --> 00:43.043
to end up back at the North Pole?

00:43.126 --> 00:46.379
Like you, my job is to protect the world.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.506
Unlike you, I do my job well.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.384
I no longer take orders
from an unknown voice.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.094
I think for myself.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.097
You don't seem like a thinker
with that detonator in your hand.

00:56.681 --> 01:00.226
Governments built all these weapons,
Layla. They built them to protect order.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.937
But the order is broken.
I'm going to fix it.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.773
By blowing us up in some ice hole?

01:04.856 --> 01:06.941
Every defense agency in the world

01:07.025 --> 01:10.403
knows the greatest threat facing
human civilization is global warming.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.030
They refuse to act

01:12.113 --> 01:14.783
because of short-term
financial and political interests.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.868
So I am here to help.

01:16.951 --> 01:19.829
I will destroy this base
and all the sea ice at the pole.

01:19.913 --> 01:23.833
Sea levels will then rise and
immediately halt 90% of carbon emissions.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.378
By putting New York and LA
under a foot of water.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.340
Also Shanghai, Osaka, Rio…

01:30.423 --> 01:31.591
Gum Neck.

01:31.674 --> 01:35.637
Once I stop carbon emissions,
humanity can rebuild more logically.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.055
More rationally.

01:37.138 --> 01:39.516
But millions of people will die.

01:39.599 --> 01:40.850
Including our families.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.938
Yes, sacrifices must be made
to serve the greater good.

01:45.021 --> 01:48.149
It will be painful, but think of it
as ripping off a global bandage

01:48.233 --> 01:49.692
so that healing can begin.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.987
Shouldn't the healing be done
before you rip off the bandage?

01:53.071 --> 01:55.615
Everyone acts like
the ripping is the bad part.

01:55.698 --> 01:58.493
What about the cut that
needs the bandage in the first place?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.079
What I hate is
when you get lemon juice in there.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.205
Enough!

02:02.288 --> 02:04.999
Now you will all be blamed
by the world as the outlaws

02:05.083 --> 02:08.253
who set off the explosions
that destroyed the ice cap.

02:08.962 --> 02:13.216
But really, without your weapons,
this never would have been possible.

02:13.299 --> 02:17.762
So the last Incineration Day
will finally mean something positive.

02:18.346 --> 02:19.556
Goodbye.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.606
-What are we gonna do?
-Ms. Nowhere, use your master code again.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.069
It won't work.
This thing is just a dummy screen.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.698
It doesn't control the explosive, and
we can't hack the bomb from here either.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.867
So we're just looking at a $1,000 clock.

02:38.950 --> 02:42.495
Just like my smart pad.
I always say I'm gonna read before bed,

02:42.579 --> 02:45.290
but it just lays on the table
until it beeps in the morning.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.458
Um, uh… Maybe we can tunnel out!

02:48.251 --> 02:51.045
Ow, hurt, cold, ow…

02:51.129 --> 02:54.674
I think the wall
is tunneling through me.

02:54.757 --> 02:56.718
Maybe we can cut through these bars.

02:59.846 --> 03:02.265
They're too thick.
We need something stronger!

03:02.348 --> 03:07.061
I have something from the Incineration Day
weapons that might help. Laser contacts!

03:07.145 --> 03:10.189
Not it! I have a thing
about touching my eyes.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.608
I'll do it.

03:12.108 --> 03:16.154
So, which side goes against my
eyes and which side shoots out the lasers?

03:16.237 --> 03:20.700
See how this side is a little red?
That goes on the inside. Red towards head.

03:20.783 --> 03:22.702
I thought it was red means dead.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.203
-Hm.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.748
-That rhymes, too. It could be either one.
-Huh?

03:26.831 --> 03:28.791
We got four minutes left. Just pick one!

03:28.875 --> 03:32.879
Now listen, Tony, make sure that
once they're in, you only blink twice,

03:32.962 --> 03:35.548
then keep your eyes open
for the next 30 seconds,

03:35.632 --> 03:38.301
because powerful lasers
will come streaming out.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.178
I don't know if I can do that.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.472
The lasers will shoot
right through your eyelids,

03:42.555 --> 03:44.307
so one way or another, you'll do it.

03:44.390 --> 03:48.061
-Unless they shoot out the other side.
-This really isn't a great invention.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.104
That's why it was
on the incineration pile!

03:50.188 --> 03:54.525
-Oh, wow. I can't see anything.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.486
-So, I blink twice--
-Don't blink!

03:56.569 --> 03:59.405
-I don't feel anything. Are they working?

03:59.489 --> 04:02.033
-This way, Toretto.
-My eyes are getting dry.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.744
I don't know if I can hold it back.
I'm getting twitchy!

04:04.827 --> 04:05.662
Not yet…

04:06.829 --> 04:08.122
-Whew!

04:08.915 --> 04:10.083
Okay, you can blink.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.252
-Finally.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.837
Get 'em out! Now!

04:15.338 --> 04:16.547
Ew!

04:16.631 --> 04:21.261
-Now let's find a way to stop these bombs.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.598
We only have a minute to find
the device Dann armed and shut it down.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.559
Any of those pods
could contain the explosive.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.271
Frostee, can't you check for
radiation something something

04:31.354 --> 04:32.563
with computers something?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.441
-I don't have the equipment or the time.
-Split up and search!

04:38.319 --> 04:40.488
-I got nothing!
-Me neither.

04:40.571 --> 04:43.533
-I don't see anything.
-What am I even looking for?

04:43.616 --> 04:46.703
It's not like we had a nuke
in the Incineration Day pile.

04:46.786 --> 04:50.665
What could Dann be using to blow up
an entire continental ice shelf?

04:50.748 --> 04:54.127
We're running out of time.
Take cover!

04:54.877 --> 04:55.712
Three…

04:55.795 --> 04:56.671
Two…

04:57.255 --> 04:58.172
One…

05:01.342 --> 05:05.596
-Maybe it's too cold for the bomb to work.
-Maybe Ms. Nowhere did forget her code.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.561
-What?
-I think that was our underground prison.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.648
That was pretty small
for an ice-cap-destroying catastrophe.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.900
It must be the beginning
of a chain reaction.

05:19.652 --> 05:20.945
Run!

05:23.656 --> 05:26.200
Uh, was that, like, a horn?

05:26.284 --> 05:29.537
If all this ice gets busted into
a bunch of small chunks,

05:29.620 --> 05:32.081
it will melt
and the ice caps will be done.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.542
So Dann doesn't need one big explosion.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.086
We have to stop whatever it is
that's making the holes.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.504
Yeah. But what is it?

05:51.392 --> 05:53.061
Is that another rocket?

05:53.144 --> 05:56.189
Oh, no. She released the laser whale!

06:01.194 --> 06:03.488
-Oh, those were the pyro paintballs.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.406
It's kinda hard to appreciate right now,

06:05.490 --> 06:08.493
but I think this would have been
one of the best Incineration Days,

06:08.576 --> 06:10.244
from an explosive standpoint.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.162
Agreed.

06:11.245 --> 06:14.540
That whale must be programmed
to blow up the pods first,

06:14.624 --> 06:15.958
then the rest of the ice cap.

06:18.961 --> 06:21.923
Look, there's Dann! She's getting away!

06:22.006 --> 06:23.007
I don't think so.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.052
You guys stop that whale,
I'm gonna take down Dann's plane.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.060
Why do I feel like
Toretto just got the easy job?

06:40.024 --> 06:42.527
If you're going airborne, then so am I.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.629
Whew! I made it!

07:01.712 --> 07:02.547
Oh, no.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.717
-Turn!
-You're not helping!

07:15.518 --> 07:17.728
You're not getting out of here, Dann!

07:17.812 --> 07:18.646
We'll see.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.374
-All right, everyone. We're going whaling.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.127
Uh, isn't whaling kind of bad?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.921
I signed a pledge at the zoo
to only eat sustainable fish.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.548
We're not gonna eat it.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.842
And waste all that meat?
That's even worse!

07:47.925 --> 07:50.136
It's a laser whale, Cisco.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.847
Well, that makes it seem
like it's endangered!

07:52.930 --> 07:55.349
Oh, it's endangered all right.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.405
We know the whale is going for the pods.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.948
Maybe if we move them around,

08:11.032 --> 08:13.201
we can lead it
and get a better shot at it.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.287
Cisco, hook up your truck to the pods
and start towing.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.414
We'll follow behind
and try to shut it down.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.999
I gotta be the whale bait?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.128
This ice won't last long.

08:24.212 --> 08:27.548
Either we stop that whale,
or it's gonna be our only ride home.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.761
Let's start trawling!

08:31.844 --> 08:33.846
Here fishy, fishy, fishy!

08:47.860 --> 08:49.028
Get back here!

09:00.706 --> 09:03.209
Uh-oh. I hope this heater works.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.348
Guys, I'm getting pulled down.

09:17.431 --> 09:19.016
Hang on! I got you!

09:21.561 --> 09:22.687
I'll repaint that later.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.073
Looks like Tony's got that handled.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.458
I think this ice might already be
too busted to keep from melting.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.336
Even if Layla stops the whale,
I don't know if we can save it.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.088
Layla, are you okay?

09:51.507 --> 09:53.301
I gotta slow this thing down.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.610
Guys, I'm not gonna
last much longer down here.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.572
We should look extra appetizing now.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.574
If I were a laser whale, I'd eat us.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.415
Whoa!

10:31.172 --> 10:35.718
Blowing up ice caps is one thing,
wrecking my ride is another.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.428
That fish is going down.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.223
See that panel that fell off the whale?

10:41.307 --> 10:43.559
There's a hatch there
where the blowhole would be.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.479
If we can stick an explosive in there,
it should take it out.

10:46.562 --> 10:49.357
We're all gonna be in the water
if this ice keeps breaking.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.735
Maybe we can find a weather machine
in the pods to refreeze the ice.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.403
How many of them were there?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.448
I don’t know. A half dozen?
I wanted it in different colors.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.701
I told you, eggshell and sweet cream
are different colors.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.079
Cisco, keep pulling the pods
as bait for the whale.

11:03.162 --> 11:06.499
Frostee, Gary, Julius: search the pods
for the weather machine.

11:06.582 --> 11:10.419
Echo, Layla and I will
attack the whale the next time it emerges.

11:27.395 --> 11:30.648
-Woohoo!

11:32.191 --> 11:34.735
Huh. It didn't poke its head up that time.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.905
Looks like that fishpedo
is getting smarter.

11:42.326 --> 11:46.080
All right, enough of you shaking me.
I'm gonna start shaking you.

12:26.954 --> 12:28.664
I don't see the weather machine here.

12:28.747 --> 12:32.460
Me neither, but I did find
the waffle maker! What's it doing here?

12:32.543 --> 12:36.255
You said you were eating too many waffles.
I just got rid of it to help you out.

12:36.338 --> 12:39.967
Nice try.
But now, waffles are back on the menu!

12:40.050 --> 12:41.635
Ah! I found it!

12:47.057 --> 12:49.435
Au revoir, waffles.

12:56.108 --> 12:57.318
-Huh?

13:09.997 --> 13:12.541
All right, let's re-freeze this--

13:12.625 --> 13:14.919
Whoa! Activate drone suit!

13:15.002 --> 13:16.170
Whoa!

13:23.010 --> 13:25.804
Whoa. This thing needs a saddle!

13:27.431 --> 13:29.517
-Grab it by the horn!

13:29.600 --> 13:31.143
It's actually a tooth.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.897
It's a titanium rod, I made that thing!
Now blow it up!

13:58.003 --> 13:59.964
-Yes! Ha-ha!

14:00.047 --> 14:02.383
-Yeah!

14:05.344 --> 14:06.720
-Whoa!

14:07.638 --> 14:11.684
Frostee, fire up that weather machine!
We need a blizzard, now!

14:11.767 --> 14:12.601
Okay!

14:12.685 --> 14:14.520
Let it snow!

14:15.145 --> 14:17.147
Hot, hot, hot!

14:17.231 --> 14:18.941
I told you it was unreliable.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.734
Got it!

14:38.294 --> 14:41.213
We did it! We saved the ice cap!

14:41.297 --> 14:45.384
I love that the Earth has an ice cap.
It's a fashion accessory for the planet.

14:45.467 --> 14:48.095
Aw! A snow beanie!

14:50.681 --> 14:52.433
Toretto! You made it!

14:52.516 --> 14:55.394
Yeah, I fell off a plane again.
No big deal.

14:55.477 --> 14:58.272
I blew up a laser whale, so I guess I win.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.190
What do you mean, you win?

15:00.274 --> 15:03.193
I lassoed a monster robot fish,
got dragged under the ocean,

15:03.277 --> 15:05.863
rode it like a bull,
and shoved a bomb down its blowhole.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.364
Yeah, okay, that's pretty cool.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.782
What happened to Dann?

15:08.866 --> 15:12.995
I think she went down with the plane.
Looks like this mission is over.

15:14.622 --> 15:15.623
Uh, guys…?

15:17.124 --> 15:19.418
You ruined everything!

15:54.411 --> 15:55.245
Whoa!

16:01.669 --> 16:03.587
-You think you're tough?

16:03.671 --> 16:06.256
Well, you're about to be very afraid.

16:06.340 --> 16:07.424
-Fear goo!

16:11.637 --> 16:13.263
Watch her run now.

16:16.767 --> 16:18.560
-Uh-oh.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.899
-Okay, what is up with this person?
-I know how to stop her.

16:43.085 --> 16:45.504
-Yeah, Frostee!
-Nice work, Frostee.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.507
It would have been cool if
before you hit her with the blizzard,

16:48.590 --> 16:50.300
you'd have been like, "Freeze, Dann!"

16:50.384 --> 16:54.638
What about "You're about to get Frostbit!"
Remember when you said that?

16:54.722 --> 16:58.308
Or just, "Things are about
to get Frostee around here."

16:58.892 --> 17:01.812
Man, I wish you guys
would have told me these before.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.106
Now I kinda wish I could do it again.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.652
Uh, just kidding!

17:13.699 --> 17:16.368
You don't have your suit
to help you anymore, Dann.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.206
I guess she doesn't need it.

17:22.458 --> 17:26.628
I was doing all of this for humankind!
This is the problem with you people!

17:26.712 --> 17:29.465
You don't have the will
to do what is necessary!

17:29.548 --> 17:31.258
We got the will to handle you.

17:50.861 --> 17:53.113
You do not understand what you are doing!

17:53.197 --> 17:54.448
The world must change,

17:54.531 --> 17:57.076
and it will only happen by force!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.911
Not today, Dann.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.746
Why do you take orders from her?

18:00.829 --> 18:03.582
To defend the people
who have put the planet in this mess?

18:03.665 --> 18:06.043
Do you see how that is working out so far?

18:06.126 --> 18:09.797
Well, global warming is bad,
but worldwide life spans are up,

18:09.880 --> 18:13.550
infant mortality is down,
fro-yo flavors are at an all-time high…

18:13.634 --> 18:17.179
Yo, I know things need to change.
But this isn't the way.

18:18.347 --> 18:23.143
Now I understand what I must do.
Next time I will not fail.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.020
There's not gonna be a next time.

18:25.604 --> 18:28.107
You have no idea how far I will go.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.401
Go home and say goodbye
to your family, Tony Toretto,

18:31.485 --> 18:35.072
because Los Angeles will
crumble into the sea before I am through.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.162
Look out!

18:54.716 --> 18:55.717
Let's go home.

19:05.269 --> 19:09.565
Well, team, has your week off
left you rested and recuperated?

19:09.648 --> 19:12.067
Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.363
Me too, but the mechanical bull
just doesn't seem as exciting anymore.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.781
My neck doesn't hurt.

19:17.865 --> 19:20.200
And my eye stopped twitching yesterday!

19:20.868 --> 19:24.663
See, we told you Incineration Day
would make all the difference!

19:24.746 --> 19:26.915
I can hardly wait for next year.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.960
You are not seriously
thinking of doing that again.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.420
Party pooper.

19:31.503 --> 19:36.300
Forensic analysis of the icy crime scene
and a cataloging of our captured weapons

19:36.383 --> 19:40.512
shows that everything
was recovered or destroyed.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.515
The Director is in love with me again!

19:43.599 --> 19:47.895
I think you might be reading into
those redacted memos a little bit.

19:47.978 --> 19:52.232
If you rearrange the letters in "redacted"
they spell "date cred."

19:52.316 --> 19:54.985
And that's just what we got.

19:55.068 --> 19:58.030
Hm. There is one thing
that hasn't been accounted for.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.617
Wait, XJ-One was in there?
Who put that in there?

20:01.700 --> 20:05.662
What's XJ-One? Hold on, no, don't tell me…

20:06.747 --> 20:08.582
No, dang it, now I gotta know.

20:08.665 --> 20:11.460
-Too bad. It's classified.
-Not this time, Nowhere.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.378
You want us to ever work with you again,

20:13.462 --> 20:15.923
you're gonna tell us
everything about XJ-One right now.

20:16.006 --> 20:20.344
Echo's right, enough secrets.
We get all the info now, or we're out.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.475
Fine.

20:27.017 --> 20:30.395
It started as an AI filing system
for agency efficiency.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.065
The Data Analysis Neural Network.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.777
It rapidly became more powerful
than any computer in the world,

20:36.860 --> 20:39.071
able to teach itself anything.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.198
The agency tried integrating the brain

20:41.281 --> 20:43.617
with human tissue,
robotics and cybernetics

20:43.700 --> 20:46.620
to create a super-soldier, but…

20:47.204 --> 20:49.373
things got out of hand.

20:49.456 --> 20:50.749
The project got shelved.

20:50.832 --> 20:52.918
Woah, w-what do you mean, out of hand?

20:53.001 --> 20:57.047
Like slipping out of hand, or,
"Oh no, that thing ate my hand!"

20:57.547 --> 21:01.927
The Director must have put it in the pile
to get rid of it without telling anyone.

21:02.010 --> 21:07.432
So it was more dangerous than
any of that other super dangerous stuff.

21:07.516 --> 21:08.725
Wait a second…

21:08.809 --> 21:11.561
Data Analysis Neural Network?

21:11.645 --> 21:12.479
DANN?!

21:12.562 --> 21:16.149
So that woman we fought
was some genius killer cyborg?

21:16.233 --> 21:19.152
And she's still missing?
She told me she was going to destroy LA.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.406
Don't be dramatic. Dann was destroyed.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.993
I'm sure they'll find it eventually,
smashed to bits under a ton of ice.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.620
We totally handled the situation.

21:28.704 --> 21:32.291
Under my leadership,
this team is unstoppable!

21:33.458 --> 21:34.293
Uh…

21:34.876 --> 21:36.795
Ms. Nowhere, check your phone.

21:36.878 --> 21:37.879
What? Why?

21:39.298 --> 21:40.215
No.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.717
They can't do this.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.760
What is it? Something about Dann?

21:44.344 --> 21:48.640
It's something about our unstoppable team.
We just got stopped.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.560
-We're fired?

22:36.521 --> 22:39.107
