WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:05.572
Tickets this way
for the Chatsworth Express!

00:05.660 --> 00:08.173
Come and watch pikeys making a mess

00:08.260 --> 00:11.855
of the lives they were given by
'im upstairs...

00:11.940 --> 00:14.898
And kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:14.980 --> 00:16.094
Wicked!

00:16.180 --> 00:17.499
Piss off!

00:17.580 --> 00:21.368
What sounds on Earth
could ever replace

00:21.460 --> 00:24.497
kids needing money
or wives in your face?

00:24.580 --> 00:26.935
Cos this, people reckon -
me included -

00:27.020 --> 00:29.488
is why pubs and drugs

00:29.580 --> 00:31.172
were kindly invented...

00:31.260 --> 00:33.774
To calm us all down
and stop us going mental.

00:33.860 --> 00:38.570
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:38.660 --> 00:44.815
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.379
You sit on our head,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.133
but... you pay the taxes.

00:49.220 --> 00:50.619
CHEERING

00:50.700 --> 00:53.373
Imagine Britain
without Chatsworth buccaneers

00:53.460 --> 00:56.691
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer, eh?

00:56.780 --> 00:58.259
Eh!

00:58.340 --> 01:02.094
Make poverty history.
Cheaper drugs now!

01:02.180 --> 01:07.049
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:07.140 --> 01:08.459
CHUCKLES

01:08.540 --> 01:12.169
Scatter! Party!

01:17.180 --> 01:18.135
Thank you.

01:19.620 --> 01:23.090
< It's coming! It's coming! The baby!

01:23.180 --> 01:25.819
Right, you all know
what you're doing, yeah?

01:28.940 --> 01:31.010
- Where you going?
- Pub. Fetch me dad.

01:31.100 --> 01:33.170
He's in. I'm calling about Monica Gallagher.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.171
(Carl) 'Some people can't do commitment.'

01:35.260 --> 01:36.329
lan! Carl!

01:36.420 --> 01:41.210
'They're scared of making bad calls.
Fucking things up. Feeling useless.'

01:42.940 --> 01:44.532
'So they never make decisions

01:44.620 --> 01:46.611
'and they never find out
what might have been.'

01:46.700 --> 01:49.134
Shite-arse! Mum's in labour, move!

01:49.220 --> 01:51.051
Yeah, right.

01:51.140 --> 01:52.255
Final prediction?

01:52.340 --> 01:56.618
I honestly don't mind,
so long as she's healthy. Oh!

01:56.700 --> 02:00.010
lan's filming, bag's packed. But where's Lanky?

02:01.100 --> 02:05.412
Er, well, just thrilled to be here,
really, support the wife.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.616
The miracle of birth.

02:07.700 --> 02:09.816
A gamut of emotions, really.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.333
Come on. >

02:15.260 --> 02:19.572
(Monica) Ah! These for Nana? Are you looking
forward to meeting your auntie?

02:21.060 --> 02:22.891
Where's the lift?

02:22.980 --> 02:25.892
- Who's doing the transport?
- Carl is.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.857
This is rubbish!

02:27.940 --> 02:32.013
- Can't have Mum waiting around! Carl!
- He said he were getting up.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.216
- What?
- I'll call Speedy Cabs.

02:34.300 --> 02:39.579
No. Forget it. Everyone stop what
they're doing. Carl let us down. Drill's over.

02:42.380 --> 02:44.610
A drill? Debbie!

02:44.700 --> 02:46.691
- You made me call the clinic for nothing?
- Tell us you're joking!

02:46.780 --> 02:49.613
Just as well it was a dry run!

02:49.700 --> 02:52.089
Shall we do a debrief?

02:52.180 --> 02:54.410
- You were in on this, eh?
- Like I had a choice.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.054
False alarm.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.971
Oh, yeah, well.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.574
OK, as I'm up...

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:15.220 --> 03:16.972
Can't afford to carry passengers.

03:17.060 --> 03:19.813
For fuck's sake, Mum wasn't in labour.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.253
You weren't to know that!

03:21.340 --> 03:23.774
Don't you think it's a bit soon
to be running drills?

03:23.860 --> 03:26.533
No. Mum always drops early.

03:26.620 --> 03:29.612
lan started the trend
of premature birth.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.659
The ensuing children came even earlier,
so by my calculations,

03:33.740 --> 03:36.459
Mrs Gallagher could give birth...

03:36.540 --> 03:38.053
tomorrow.

03:38.140 --> 03:41.291
All this excitement, eh, baby?

03:42.900 --> 03:48.975
If you're coming any day now, I'd better go
and lie down upstairs. Conserve our energy.

03:50.020 --> 03:52.693
Nice one, Debbie!
Now she's having kittens as well.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.896
Shut up.

03:54.980 --> 03:58.814
Stan, it's cash and carry day.
I've got to leave in five minutes.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.970
Always rushing me, aren't you?

04:01.060 --> 04:03.290
Except when it's treats time.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.617
Just because I let you stay here three times
a week don't mean you can move in.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.258
What?

04:10.340 --> 04:12.774
Next thing, you'll be proposing!

04:12.860 --> 04:15.055
You can get that right out of your head.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.656
It's just a spare pair of undies.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.849
Just don't, all right?
I'm too angry.

04:27.940 --> 04:29.771
Yeah, Mum.

04:29.860 --> 04:32.055
Chesney! What are you doing here?!
It's five to nine.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.017
About school...

04:34.100 --> 04:36.739
I don't want to talk about school.
Just go to it.

04:38.340 --> 04:40.808
It's just Mrs Kay in RE.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.256
I know. You're Muslim,
so why learn about other religions?

04:44.340 --> 04:48.970
Because RE is the difference
between ten GCSEs and nine

04:49.060 --> 04:52.211
and you promised me double figures,
so just do one!

04:52.300 --> 04:54.575
Is nobody going to school today?

04:54.660 --> 04:57.652
I'm on free periods till lunch
and then I'm on at t'shop.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.537
I told you that yesterday. >

04:59.620 --> 05:03.215
Don't think you're getting out of working
tomorrow night. I know your game.

05:03.300 --> 05:07.657
I know what you're all thinking
before you've even thought it.

05:12.260 --> 05:16.378
These mean nothing. I put them in your drawer
for convenience, that's all. No hidden agenda.

05:16.460 --> 05:18.974
You could have asked.

05:19.060 --> 05:23.053
What's so bad about us shacking up together,
anyway? I'm here half the week.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.095
That's different!

05:24.180 --> 05:28.332
How is it? And what's wrong with us
moving things on a bit, thinking long term?

05:28.420 --> 05:31.173
- Stan, we're not having this conversation.
- Do think we should?

05:31.260 --> 05:33.091
- No! Not now!
- Why not?

05:33.180 --> 05:36.092
- Because I'm late. Don't push me.
- Or what?

05:38.660 --> 05:42.050
Oh, right. I see. Yeah, great.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.370
Good to know, Yvonne. Good to know.

05:45.700 --> 05:48.453
- I'll speak to you later, OK?
- Yeah.

05:57.660 --> 06:01.255
I can't believe you volunteered us
for cycling proficiency lessons.

06:01.340 --> 06:04.138
Opportunity to nick
some bike thieves, Tom.

06:04.220 --> 06:06.211
Ultraviolet light,
serial codes for bikes.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.609
That's why they made me a sergeant.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.817
- All right, there, Stanley?
- Loved up to limbo in two minutes, for pants.

06:11.900 --> 06:14.972
You left those? Not your <i>special</i> boxers?

06:15.060 --> 06:18.894
They were the first pair I could find,
so shows you how trivial I think it all is.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.255
Guys,
are you still looking for a lodger?

06:22.860 --> 06:25.658
Us? No. No room at our inn.

06:25.740 --> 06:27.219
Don't know where you got that from.

06:27.300 --> 06:29.689
Canteen Val. Said that Stan's
moving in with his missus.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.169
God, I'm not moving in with Yvonne!

06:32.260 --> 06:34.091
How many times?

06:37.500 --> 06:38.933
What?

06:53.020 --> 06:56.012
Carl, come on,
you can't stay in bed all day.

06:56.100 --> 06:59.172
- I've left school, I'll do what I want.
- Not with another mouth to feed.

06:59.260 --> 07:01.820
You know the score,
everybody mucks in. Carl!

07:01.900 --> 07:03.811
Piss off!

07:08.220 --> 07:11.530
I am trying to get more
than just the odd shift at the shop.

07:11.620 --> 07:15.374
Full-time kitchen assistant
at a city centre hotel? That's all right.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.974
I filled out 12 of them last week.

07:18.060 --> 07:20.369
Not one interview.
It's a waste of time.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.655
What if this is the one
that gets you the interview?

07:22.740 --> 07:25.618
- It's fuck all use unless you hand it in, mate.
- Watch.

07:25.700 --> 07:30.569
I'll get my hopes up on the bus to town
and I get knocked back. Again.

07:30.660 --> 07:33.174
Haven't even got me fucking fare.

07:33.260 --> 07:37.139
- How much short are you?
- Forget it. I'll get it out the surfboard fund.

07:37.220 --> 07:38.778
It's what it's for these days.

07:40.420 --> 07:41.773
Where's my bottle?

07:43.060 --> 07:46.177
Â£1.32.

07:46.260 --> 07:48.410
I really thought there'd be more.

07:48.500 --> 07:52.288
Kids. No head for saving these days.
How many cans?

07:52.380 --> 07:54.257
One, but I'm not taking that.

07:54.340 --> 07:59.368
What?! I know for a fact
your mum loves change. Shit!

07:59.460 --> 08:01.530
Such a waste, man.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.290
Hands up! Get your hands up!

08:05.380 --> 08:07.894
Oh, shit! Shitting hell!

08:07.980 --> 08:09.777
Don't talk to me
and don't touch owt.

08:09.860 --> 08:11.896
Just do what I tell you! Freeze!

08:11.980 --> 08:14.938
- I said freeze!
- I'm froze. Sleeping lions.

08:15.020 --> 08:18.092
- Anybody else?
- No. Just take whatever and go.

08:18.180 --> 08:20.694
< Meena, why is this door locked?

08:20.780 --> 08:22.338
- Who's that?
- My mum.

08:22.420 --> 08:23.853
< Come on, open the door.
What are you doing?

08:23.940 --> 08:26.056
Let her in. No nonsense.

08:26.140 --> 08:28.017
< Unlock this door now!

08:30.220 --> 08:33.371
Is this what happens
the second I set foot out the place?

08:33.460 --> 08:35.416
- Shut it!
- Oh!

08:35.500 --> 08:37.889
Do exactly what I tell you and nobody gets
hurt.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.331
What the hell are you doing?

08:46.420 --> 08:49.059
I'm just getting me hospital bag ready.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.937
How long do you think you're going for?

08:55.260 --> 08:56.978
What's with the bikini?

08:57.060 --> 08:59.779
Well, in case I want a water birth.

09:07.140 --> 09:09.608
It's not what you think.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.333
That's my room.

09:17.420 --> 09:18.933
I'll decide when I'm going.

09:19.020 --> 09:21.250
Not you and Canteen Val.

09:21.340 --> 09:23.092
She's always asking after you.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.250
I just said we hadn't seen much of you.

09:25.340 --> 09:27.934
Well, she's not the only one.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.578
This is doing my head in!

09:38.340 --> 09:41.412
(Tom) The plan was
to discreetly put the feelers out -

09:41.500 --> 09:43.252
test the market - not drop us in it.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.850
(Stan) Yvonne?

09:47.940 --> 09:50.170
I didn't know Val was gonna
put it round the entire nick.

09:50.260 --> 09:52.854
She's the biggest
gobshite of them all!

09:52.940 --> 09:55.056
I thought she was
a sweet old dinner lady.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.450
- Yvonne! Open the door! >
- A good sarge knows her staff.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.896
I can tell you the names of everyone
who works at our nick.

10:01.980 --> 10:04.448
Fine. But do you <i>know</i> them?

10:04.540 --> 10:07.850
- A good sarge would.
- Yvonne! >

10:07.940 --> 10:10.215
- Open the door!
- Copper.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.056
I know you're there. I can see you.

10:13.140 --> 10:16.894
I'm not going anywhere until we sort out
this stupid pants nonsense!

10:16.980 --> 10:19.289
Stan! I'll talk to you later, yeah?

10:19.380 --> 10:21.132
No! I'm here. Talk to me now.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.939
- She's not letting him in.
- Let me in. >

10:24.020 --> 10:26.056
He is not happy.

10:26.140 --> 10:29.177
I'd get in the back if I were you.
Keep your head down.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.375
Grow up, Tom.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.735
Let me in or
I'll break this door down.

10:32.820 --> 10:34.299
Shit!

10:34.380 --> 10:36.575
BANGING ON DOOR

10:36.660 --> 10:38.013
Yvonne.

10:41.020 --> 10:43.818
Is everything OK in there?

10:43.900 --> 10:45.219
Yvonne, what's going on?

10:45.300 --> 10:47.052
(A fucking stick-up bloke
with a bloody big gun.)

10:47.140 --> 10:51.975
- Stand back - I'll kick it in!
- Piss off! I'm nearly there.

10:52.620 --> 10:55.339
Get away from the door! Get back!

10:55.420 --> 10:56.853
Don't shoot, I'm unarmed.

10:56.940 --> 10:59.215
- What's that in your hand?
- Nothing.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.052
Hands where I can see them!

11:01.140 --> 11:02.653
< Why don't you lower the weapon?

11:02.740 --> 11:05.254
- I just want everyone to go out of here...
- Shut up!

11:05.340 --> 11:08.491
You're not calling the shots here - I am!
Get over there and get down.

11:09.580 --> 11:10.615
You!

11:14.140 --> 11:17.928
Anyone tries anything
and I start throwing bodies out!

11:21.300 --> 11:24.133
- OK. Now empty the safe.
- What?

11:24.220 --> 11:26.370
You've got a shop.
You've got a safe. Move.

11:26.460 --> 11:28.655
- Just do as he says.
- There's nothing in it.

11:28.740 --> 11:32.096
- I had to dip into it for the mortgage.
- Whatever! Come on.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.977
Fine. But you're wasting your time.

11:34.940 --> 11:37.534
I'm not a fucking idiot, yeah?
Now let's do this.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.173
What now?

11:43.260 --> 11:46.616
It's on a timer. Once I put the code in,
it takes half an hour.

11:46.700 --> 11:49.373
- There's nothing to be gained from stalling him.
- I'm not stalling.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.975
It's on a timer.
The back door's sealed to deter robbers.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.618
I'm here. This is happening.

11:54.700 --> 11:58.215
Open it. You're just
going to have to sit tight.

11:59.460 --> 12:01.849
Chesney! What are you doing?

12:01.940 --> 12:04.659
Nothing. Who's he?

12:04.740 --> 12:06.696
- Robin Hoodie.
- How many people?!

12:06.780 --> 12:10.090
- Were you wanking?
- Fuck off! I was in a study forum.

12:10.180 --> 12:13.855
Forum? You should be at school doing RE,
where you're safe.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.931
Skiving while I'm at Costco!

12:16.020 --> 12:18.659
- Come on. Not now.
- Don't "come on" me. This is my family.

12:18.740 --> 12:23.097
- Keep your nose out.
- OK, enough! Enter the code.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.492
BEEPING

12:31.020 --> 12:34.296
It's you saying that
the baby's coming. >

12:34.380 --> 12:36.018
I'm sure this is all just normal.

12:36.100 --> 12:38.409
- Last-minute nerves.
- It's not that.

12:41.340 --> 12:43.456
There.

12:43.540 --> 12:46.179
You're meant to breast-feed these days, and...

12:46.260 --> 12:49.093
well, me milk hasn't come.

12:49.180 --> 12:51.648
You don't need to breast-feed.

12:51.740 --> 12:55.335
I bet all the women that write this
are them militant lactators

12:55.420 --> 12:57.172
that have teenagers hanging off theirs.

12:57.260 --> 13:00.093
- Hmm.
- You give us a bottle, didn't you?

13:00.180 --> 13:05.254
I had to, because after I fed Fiona,
these dropped a whole two inches.

13:05.340 --> 13:07.058
They used to be right up there.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.290
Did formula do us any harm?

13:09.380 --> 13:12.770
It's not the same as giving
your baby the boob.

13:13.980 --> 13:16.175
I want it to be natural.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.850
I want it to be perfect.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.655
I can't bear to be a crap mum again.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.412
You won't be.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.650
<i>I won't let you.</i>

13:27.740 --> 13:29.298
Stop worrying!

13:29.380 --> 13:30.813
Yeah.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.696
Thanks, love.

13:37.700 --> 13:38.655
Oi!

13:40.420 --> 13:41.933
Just until you settle down.

13:50.260 --> 13:51.693
Oh, hiya.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.532
No, it's locked. I couldn't get in...

13:53.620 --> 13:56.692
< Won't be a minute!
Police business.

14:00.260 --> 14:01.739
RADIO CRACKLES

14:03.300 --> 14:05.097
He's turned his radio off.

14:06.900 --> 14:09.619
Kerry from community support.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.531
I'm not playing your stupid game,
Tom, save your breath.

14:11.620 --> 14:12.575
Fine, only...

14:12.660 --> 14:16.175
Look, I've passed my exam,
I've got my stripes.

14:16.260 --> 14:19.013
I've shown what it really takes
to be a sergeant.

14:19.100 --> 14:23.616
Fine, if that's all you want to be -
a sergeant - not a <i>good</i> sarge.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.737
He's got ten minutes
and then I'm dragging him out of there.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.175
(Robber) What is this, man?

14:29.260 --> 14:31.694
There's a fucking cop car
outside now!

14:31.780 --> 14:34.294
It's my colleagues. Probably waiting
for me to sort stuff with Yvonne.

14:34.380 --> 14:36.610
How am I supposed
to get out now, eh?

14:36.700 --> 14:39.931
Duh! Something you should have
thought about earlier, maybe.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.250
- Do you know him?
- Shut up!

14:42.340 --> 14:45.810
Fucking talk to him like you did.
I know his voice from somewhere.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.219
Do I know you?

14:47.300 --> 14:50.849
- Chesney, sit down for us, pal.
- What? He's not gonna shoot me.

14:50.940 --> 14:54.615
- He's bricking it. Hand's shaking.
- Listen to the Fed, brother.

14:54.700 --> 14:58.170
I'm not your brother. Are you a Musi?
How do we know each other?

14:58.260 --> 14:59.932
Fellas, let's keep our heads, eh?

15:00.020 --> 15:01.578
Chesney, back off.

15:06.420 --> 15:08.058
How did you know about the safe?

15:08.140 --> 15:10.415
Eh? You've got a shop,
you've got a safe!

15:10.500 --> 15:12.934
No, the only people
who know about it are here.

15:13.020 --> 15:14.533
You're too clued up.

15:14.620 --> 15:18.932
You rob me the one morning I'm not here.
How did you know that?

15:23.580 --> 15:30.258
Please don't tell me this is what I think it is -
an inside job. Whose idea were it?

15:31.580 --> 15:32.490
Well?

15:32.580 --> 15:35.617
You said this was going to be easy!

15:35.700 --> 15:39.249
Put on a show for the cameras -
in and out, no distractions.

15:39.340 --> 15:44.130
Fucking hell's bells, Stan!
I thought my lot were wrong 'uns.

15:44.220 --> 15:48.213
I knew it. Asif Khan,
evil, money-lending harami!

15:48.300 --> 15:50.689
Easy, Chesney, he's still carrying.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.857
This wasn't meant to happen.

15:58.660 --> 16:02.733
20 applicants to clean dishes
and they tell me, "Lack of experience".

16:02.820 --> 16:04.492
I'm unemployable.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.457
I can't make owt, fix owt.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.178
I wouldn't even give me a job.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.296
Dear, oh, dear, dry your eyes.

16:10.380 --> 16:14.214
There's a place in the workforce for everybody,
and even coconuts like you.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.938
- In't that right, Nicky?
- Yeah.

16:16.020 --> 16:19.217
You're not using your bread box.
You tell us what you're after

16:19.300 --> 16:21.655
and we'll come up with
the perfect job for you.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.810
I want something
people are impressed by.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.255
I want them to look at me and say,
"There's Carl Gallagher, the..."

16:26.340 --> 16:27.489
Lumberjack.

16:30.140 --> 16:32.131
And it needs to be around girls.

16:32.220 --> 16:35.895
So you want a job that gets you laid,
doesn't require you to think.

16:35.980 --> 16:39.336
I suppose. And if I could travel, great.
See the world and that.

16:39.420 --> 16:42.412
- Uniform?
- Ladies love a man in uniform.

16:42.500 --> 16:45.890
- As long as I don't look like a dick.
- (AIl) Holiday rep!

16:46.820 --> 16:49.380
GIRLS LAUGH

16:49.460 --> 16:52.611
Hello, sailor. Anyone for tennis?

16:52.700 --> 16:56.329
- Clear off taking the piss!
- No, it was inspired, that.

16:56.420 --> 17:00.379
I'll show yous. I'm going to do something
that gets me respect.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.659
I want what I'm owed.

17:17.740 --> 17:19.856
- How much?
- Two.

17:19.940 --> 17:22.056
Grand?
What the fuck do you need that for?

17:22.140 --> 17:24.494
- What's it got to do with you?
- It's my mum you're robbing!

17:24.579 --> 17:28.016
Don't get holier than thou with me.
Doing study forums in her shop(!)

17:28.099 --> 17:29.533
Stop it!

17:29.620 --> 17:31.417
What have I done to deserve this?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.298
What's happened to my kids?

17:34.380 --> 17:36.894
What did you need the loan for, Meena?

17:36.980 --> 17:38.777
Pay off a bar bill?

17:38.860 --> 17:42.250
- Buy more party dresses?
- No. I paid a photographer to take shots of me.

17:42.340 --> 17:44.058
- I want to be a model.
- You?!

17:44.140 --> 17:47.815
If you have been flashing your fanny
for some dirty old perv...

17:47.900 --> 17:51.131
I'm trying to tell you.
Why do you always think you know it all?

17:51.220 --> 17:52.858
Cos when it comes to you, I do.

17:52.940 --> 17:54.692
Didn't know I were going to do this!

17:54.780 --> 17:58.090
- I got behind with the repayments.
- So you decided to rob me!

17:58.180 --> 18:01.138
You never listen.
You assume everything.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.336
So now I'm to blame for all this.

18:03.420 --> 18:06.571
I screwed up.
But everything I've said is true, Mum!

18:06.660 --> 18:08.059
Chesney will back me up.

18:08.140 --> 18:11.337
He tried telling you
why he didn't want to go to school today.

18:11.420 --> 18:14.218
- No, he didn't.
- I did, actually. Twice!

18:16.100 --> 18:17.852
I'm the same, Yvonne.

18:17.940 --> 18:19.658
< Selective hearing.

18:19.740 --> 18:24.814
- To be fair, you kids do talk a lot of bollocks.
- Shut up, Frank!

18:26.340 --> 18:29.491
So, you're with them.

18:29.580 --> 18:33.619
My son's bunking off.
My daughter's trying to hustle me.

18:33.700 --> 18:36.214
My boyfriend thinks I'm a bitch.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.853
It's all my fault, then.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.655
Great!

18:44.300 --> 18:46.211
Could you run us to Bettabuys?

18:46.300 --> 18:47.699
No, get a bus!

18:47.780 --> 18:49.293
Oh, thanks!

18:50.900 --> 18:53.175
Half an hour!

18:53.260 --> 18:56.411
He's just hiding
to get out of cycling proficiency.

18:56.500 --> 19:01.733
Carrie! They could be making up.
Do you really want to interrupt that?

19:03.340 --> 19:06.218
OK, PC O'Leary, would you say
that a good sarge

19:06.300 --> 19:09.337
distinguishes herself
by making big calls under pressure?

19:09.420 --> 19:10.409
I would.

19:10.500 --> 19:15.096
Well, we need to educate the next generation
of Chatsworth cyclists. Let's go.

19:15.180 --> 19:18.138
Lover-boy can explain his absence
to the inspector.

19:24.300 --> 19:26.097
< Lying bitch!

19:26.180 --> 19:28.330
< What the hell is this?

19:28.420 --> 19:32.299
<i>You</i> said that safe
was full of money.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.859
Asif, let go. Come on!

19:33.940 --> 19:36.249
- Scaring her won't bring the money back.
- I said there was nothing in it.

19:36.340 --> 19:38.137
I thought you were having me on.

19:38.220 --> 19:41.656
Fucking hell! What now, eh?
How am I going to get my cash?

19:41.740 --> 19:43.298
They've got a massive telly...

19:43.380 --> 19:46.372
How am I going to get out of here
without getting arrested?

19:46.460 --> 19:48.735
- We'll give you the CCTV tape.
- What?!

19:48.820 --> 19:52.176
Look, that tape is the only proof
that you were here.

19:52.260 --> 19:55.218
We'll give it you and then go.

19:55.300 --> 19:58.178
Oh, so what about your mates, eh?

19:58.260 --> 20:02.378
What about them? They only respond to
crimes and you were here shopping, right?

20:02.460 --> 20:04.416
I'll pay you the money.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.776
No, wait, it's not your debt.
He's a thieving scumbag!

20:07.860 --> 20:10.010
- You, shut it!
- He sorts people out.

20:10.100 --> 20:13.137
He's the one everybody goes to
when nobody else will help.

20:13.220 --> 20:14.938
He's been there for plenty of families here.

20:15.020 --> 20:18.296
Besides, what have I told you
about borrowing money?

20:18.380 --> 20:22.259
- Pay it back before interest is due.
- I'll get you the rest.

20:22.340 --> 20:25.571
How do I know you won't cry off?
Send bobbies round to my house?

20:25.660 --> 20:28.379
She knows you'd give up Meena
as an accessory.

20:28.460 --> 20:33.534
You've got to trust each other.
We all have to make out like this didn't happen.

20:36.540 --> 20:39.657
Er... excuse me, shopkeeper!

20:39.740 --> 20:41.651
In return for my silence...

20:46.820 --> 20:48.299
Hey, Yvonne...

20:49.380 --> 20:51.052
Don't push your luck!

20:51.140 --> 20:53.813
- Give me the gun.
- I can't. It's my cousin's.

20:53.900 --> 20:57.415
I'm not having some bloke
walking through Chatsworth with that!

21:13.940 --> 21:17.376
<i>...Drown my sorrows and I-I-I</i>

21:17.460 --> 21:21.135
<i>Had a feeling that I belong</i>

21:21.220 --> 21:23.450
<i>I- I-I</i>

21:23.540 --> 21:26.771
<i>Had a feeling I could be someone...</i>

21:26.860 --> 21:28.498
Hear you're about to drop, girl!

21:29.500 --> 21:33.175
Leftovers from when our Mandy had Katie.
Clogging up my cupboards.

21:33.260 --> 21:35.774
Right, ta!

21:35.860 --> 21:38.090
Fucking decent stuff, this!

21:38.180 --> 21:41.968
Breast pump.
Nipple pads to soak up your leakage.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.574
- Here, has your milk come in yet?
- No.

21:44.660 --> 21:47.936
Really? In that case,
hit a truck the other day.

21:48.020 --> 21:51.569
Red Cross. Shit loads of baby formula.
You can have it.

21:51.660 --> 21:53.776
In case your baby doesn't lock on.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.174
See ya.

22:03.220 --> 22:04.892
All right, Mon?

22:04.980 --> 22:06.891
No.

22:06.980 --> 22:09.574
It's all this "baby this", "baby that".

22:09.660 --> 22:11.537
Just chill, eh?

22:13.140 --> 22:15.210
It's not good for you or the baby.

22:16.940 --> 22:18.976
Got to calm down.

22:19.060 --> 22:22.052
Think about what's best
for you both, eh?

22:22.140 --> 22:23.812
What's best for us.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.619
Get her out! She wants it.

22:26.700 --> 22:30.852
I want it.
Just do it before I go mad!

22:34.740 --> 22:37.379
Nice cup of tea, two sugars.

22:49.740 --> 22:53.176
- You're making us go to school?
- After we've been held hostage?

22:53.260 --> 22:55.137
Normal service resumes.

22:55.220 --> 22:59.577
Plus, I want you back here by tea-time.
We've got stuff to sort out.

22:59.660 --> 23:01.093
Go on!

23:06.220 --> 23:08.450
- Close for the day, eh, Yvonne?
- No!

23:08.540 --> 23:10.019
I'm OK.

23:11.820 --> 23:16.052
About this morning...
I'm sorry.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.655
I guess I'm just not great at change.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.253
Don't beat yourself up, love.

23:23.340 --> 23:27.015
Coming from a big family of hard bastards,
the soft didn't survive.

23:27.100 --> 23:31.457
When I thought I'd found the man
who was going to make me happy,

23:31.540 --> 23:34.213
he just turned out to be
a big-spending poof.

23:34.300 --> 23:37.929
- There isn't that much to smile about.
- I make you smile, don't I?

23:38.020 --> 23:40.614
I definitely made you smile at least twice.
Hey, hat-trick!

23:40.700 --> 23:44.215
- Yvonne, I want to make you happy.
- Oh, Stan...

23:44.300 --> 23:49.055
What? Come on, we had a row. Big deal!
This works. It'd be crazy to give this up.

23:49.140 --> 23:52.689
And you know, if you want to face facts,

23:52.780 --> 23:56.090
- neither of us is getting any younger.
- Stan, I don't want this conversation.

23:56.180 --> 24:01.129
Why not? I'm not your folks, I'm not Kash.
I'm a good bloke and sod it! I love you.

24:01.220 --> 24:05.611
I wasn't planning on moving in with you just
yet. That's not what these pants are about.

24:05.700 --> 24:09.659
But it's what I want down the line. I want us
to be together. I wanna be part of your family.

24:09.740 --> 24:10.809
Stan, stop!

24:10.900 --> 24:13.130
- Marry me, love!
- No!

24:13.220 --> 24:16.178
- You don't get it, do you?
- Yvonne Karib, will you marry me?!

24:16.260 --> 24:17.693
I can't.

24:20.540 --> 24:21.450
Stan!

24:21.540 --> 24:23.656
Are you all right?

24:23.740 --> 24:26.015
- It's OK.
- Talk to me.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.216
- It's fine.
- Oh, Stan!

24:31.140 --> 24:33.131
Thank God for bullet-proof vests!

24:34.740 --> 24:36.378
Stan!

24:40.940 --> 24:43.898
It's me boyfriend, he's been shot!

24:43.980 --> 24:45.174
He's a copper!

24:45.260 --> 24:46.773
Please hurry.

24:48.060 --> 24:50.096
Between the shoulder and...

24:50.180 --> 24:53.456
Oh, Causeway Parade, Chatsworth.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.971
Please hurry, there's blood everywhere!
What can I do?

25:01.700 --> 25:02.689
(Right... )

25:04.180 --> 25:06.250
It's all right,
the ambulance is coming.

25:07.580 --> 25:09.935
It's gonna be OK.
Press there for me.

25:11.900 --> 25:15.097
Please, hurry up! He's not good.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.818
ELECTRICAL CRACKLING

25:21.900 --> 25:26.655

25:35.940 --> 25:38.295
Right, everyone, stop!

25:38.380 --> 25:41.258
Hit the brakes!
What did I tell you to do when I blew this?

25:41.340 --> 25:42.853
(RADIO) 'Reports of a gunshot... '

25:42.940 --> 25:44.453
WHISTLE
Carrie, hush yourself.

25:44.540 --> 25:47.816

25:47.900 --> 25:49.731
'Informant is a Mrs Yvonne Karib... '

25:49.820 --> 25:50.775
Stan!

25:54.340 --> 25:56.808
God, what've I done?

25:59.700 --> 26:00.769
I'm scared, love.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.612
I'm getting cold.

26:02.700 --> 26:04.292
Really cold.

26:05.380 --> 26:08.816
You're against the fridge, Stan.
Cuddle me.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.174
HE PANTS

26:10.260 --> 26:11.739
Ambulance will be here soon.

26:13.260 --> 26:14.659
Why can't you marry me?

26:14.740 --> 26:18.528
Don't talk about that now.
Save your strength.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.457
I have to know... please.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.974
If I could, I would.

26:24.060 --> 26:25.209
But I can't.

26:25.300 --> 26:28.576
What's stopping us? You can tell me.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.696
I'm still married.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.259
How?

26:32.340 --> 26:34.092
Kash is alive.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.933
I thought... he killed himself.

26:37.020 --> 26:39.853
I made him fake it
to get creditors off his back.

26:39.940 --> 26:42.500
He were up to his eyes in debt.

26:42.580 --> 26:45.811
Nobody knows.
That's why I can't marry you.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.174
It would just be wrong.

26:47.260 --> 26:48.978
Yvonne...

26:49.060 --> 26:50.732
Why didn't you tell me?

26:50.820 --> 26:52.572

Oh, Jesus Chr...!

26:57.900 --> 27:00.460
OK, find the weapon. Yvonne...

27:00.540 --> 27:04.249
Come on, give them room to work.
We need to let them help Stan.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.171
HE GROANS

27:06.260 --> 27:08.296
I need to ask you some questions.

27:08.380 --> 27:09.574
All right, Stan? >

27:09.660 --> 27:12.493
- Who did this?
- It were an accident.

27:12.580 --> 27:15.378
OK. So where's the gun now?

27:16.500 --> 27:18.695
- It just went off.
- Sarge...

27:21.980 --> 27:24.414
All right, you stay with Stan,
and call me if...

27:26.580 --> 27:27.535
Sure.

27:27.620 --> 27:30.259
Look up, look away, Stan,
that's good. >

27:30.340 --> 27:33.696
- Yvonne, I need to get you to the station.
- I wanna go with Stan.

27:33.780 --> 27:36.897
- We'll keep you updated.
- I wanna go in the ambulance!

27:36.980 --> 27:42.657
Best not to make this any more difficult.
Let's just get in the car, yeah? Come on.

27:44.020 --> 27:45.214
Stan...

27:45.300 --> 27:46.858
Don't you dare die!

27:49.740 --> 27:51.059
(Both) You joined the Army?!

27:51.140 --> 27:52.971
Yeah. Well, entrance test next week.

27:53.060 --> 27:55.528
Recruitment guy reckons
I've got what it takes.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.178
Yeah, to get your head shot off.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.330
I don't want your death
on my conscience.

27:59.420 --> 28:03.413
- I know the risks, I watch DVDs.
- Yeah, man, cut Rambo some slack.

28:03.500 --> 28:06.412
He's old enough to know his own mind,
and he looks the part.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.377
The Army is perfect for me.

28:08.460 --> 28:10.530
Girls love the uniform,
I get to travel.

28:10.620 --> 28:13.054
- (Man) Jamie! Two pints, please. >
- Make the most of me assets.

28:13.140 --> 28:16.655
Your assets will be fuck all use
when you're in a sniper's sights.

28:16.740 --> 28:19.015
Lads like you get used, Carl -
you're cannon fodder!

28:19.100 --> 28:20.453
Piss off, lan!

28:20.540 --> 28:23.816
I make this big life decision because you're
on my case. Now you're having a pop at me.

28:23.900 --> 28:27.688
- I can't win with you!
- I didn't make you enlist!

28:27.780 --> 28:30.214
- So you think I've made a mistake.
- Yeah.

28:32.260 --> 28:36.094
Well, obviously, if you come home
in a body bag, it's a bad idea.

28:36.180 --> 28:37.613
Stuff the lot of you!

28:37.700 --> 28:39.053
I'm doing this!

28:39.140 --> 28:40.573
Who dares wins.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.776
You all right there, Mrs G?
Do you want a lift anywhere?

28:50.860 --> 28:52.771
Nah, you're all right.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.054
Got to walk.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.131
Long walks and curry.

28:57.580 --> 28:59.059
Mickey! >

28:59.140 --> 29:02.177
- Can you take us to Balti Heaven?
- Do what?

29:05.940 --> 29:09.057
I've got a craving.
Oh, and go via Anderson Road, eh?

29:09.140 --> 29:10.971
Why?

29:20.940 --> 29:22.373
Mmm.

29:29.340 --> 29:30.329
Mmm...

29:30.420 --> 29:32.729
SHE CHOKES

29:32.820 --> 29:35.493
Sorry, baby,
but I'm doing this for both of us.

29:35.580 --> 29:37.491
Oh, please let me pull over, Mrs G.

29:37.580 --> 29:40.333
You're gonna stain me covers.
I've got to do a hen party.

29:40.420 --> 29:44.254
No. Humps are good. I want more humps.

29:47.060 --> 29:51.178
Frank. I need to find me husband.

29:55.700 --> 30:00.649
Munich, Waco, Beslan...

30:00.740 --> 30:03.618
Name one siege that ended well.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.216
Exactly.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.528
None.

30:10.740 --> 30:12.571
There's my husband!

30:16.060 --> 30:18.858
Blessed, I am.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.373
Frank!

30:21.660 --> 30:23.616
Frank!

30:23.700 --> 30:25.930
I need you to take me from behind.

30:27.420 --> 30:30.059
What did I tell ya? Blessed.

30:42.620 --> 30:45.532
Well, come on, then - today.

30:45.620 --> 30:47.531
I don't think I can, love.

30:47.620 --> 30:48.973
Do you need an 'and?

30:49.060 --> 30:53.451
- No, no, he's working...
- It's most men's fantasy, this!

30:53.540 --> 30:57.328
A blooming woman, begging for it,
doggy, nice and deep.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.172
I've had a very traumatic day.

30:59.260 --> 31:00.295
Oh...

31:00.380 --> 31:02.291
What if the nipper gets brain damage?

31:02.380 --> 31:03.859
You know, from the thrusting?

31:03.940 --> 31:06.500
They have that soft bit
on the top of their head...

31:06.580 --> 31:10.129
You're not gonna hurt the baby,
you're not even gonna come close.

31:10.220 --> 31:13.053
Now shag me! I need cock!

31:13.140 --> 31:14.892
Give me some cock!

31:14.980 --> 31:17.653
I can't, not with him there!

31:21.580 --> 31:23.457
Pint and a painkiller, ta, Jamie.

31:23.540 --> 31:25.019
Hey? Cheers.

31:26.540 --> 31:27.495
Ta.

31:27.580 --> 31:30.970
They don't design bars
with disabled veterans in mind.

31:31.060 --> 31:32.254
You in the Army?

31:32.340 --> 31:33.978
What of it?

31:34.060 --> 31:36.972
Nothing, just... I'm joining.

31:37.060 --> 31:39.699
Oh, right. Good for you.

31:39.780 --> 31:41.896
No, fucking good for you, pal.

31:41.980 --> 31:43.971
It takes a brave lad to sign up nowadays.

31:47.340 --> 31:48.773
Queen and country.

31:48.860 --> 31:50.691
Yeah, man.

31:52.700 --> 31:54.418
You won't regret it.

31:54.500 --> 31:57.936
The British Army
is the best in the world.

31:58.020 --> 32:01.615
Takes kids and turns 'em
into ultimate warriors.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.611
Right.

32:03.700 --> 32:05.099
So where were you posted?

32:05.180 --> 32:10.459
All over. Iraq, Afghanistan -
scary places, like.

32:11.660 --> 32:15.733
Great times, though. Yup.
Best six months of my life.

32:15.820 --> 32:16.969
That's not long.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.096
Mmm. No.

32:19.180 --> 32:20.932
But you know what?

32:21.020 --> 32:23.375
I might've had me back snapped
by the Taliban,

32:23.460 --> 32:25.655
but I've no regrets.

32:25.740 --> 32:29.938
Be nice to piss standing up again,
like, but you can't win 'em all.

32:30.020 --> 32:31.373
GIGGLING

32:32.420 --> 32:33.569
You pricks!

32:33.660 --> 32:34.615
What?

32:34.700 --> 32:38.409
You really think I'd fall for this?
Back snapped by Taliban?

32:38.500 --> 32:40.889
- Do you think I'm stupid?!
- Mate, it was my idea.

32:40.980 --> 32:43.574
- He went along with it.
- You haven't thought about it properly!

32:43.660 --> 32:45.457
And who's this twat?

32:45.540 --> 32:48.612
Come on... Come on, get up,
so I can smack yer! Come on...

32:48.700 --> 32:50.770
Carl! He can't!

32:50.860 --> 32:54.409
The chair's for real.
He broke his back on the railways.

32:56.740 --> 32:57.695
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

33:03.020 --> 33:04.294
Finally.

33:04.380 --> 33:06.416
I've been worried sick!

33:06.500 --> 33:07.728
Is there any news?

33:07.820 --> 33:11.415
- Here.
- Carrie!

33:11.500 --> 33:14.617
- He's being operated on, it's all I know.
- Is he gonna be OK?

33:14.700 --> 33:16.452
I don't know any more than that.

33:16.540 --> 33:17.973
When will he be out?

33:18.060 --> 33:19.334
Yvonne...

33:19.420 --> 33:20.978
CID are gonna wanna talk to you.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.288
Right.

33:22.380 --> 33:25.213
For that to happen,
you've gotta be under caution.

33:26.540 --> 33:27.734
What?

33:27.820 --> 33:29.458
You're gonna arrest me?!

33:29.540 --> 33:31.178
They know the CCTV tape's missing.

33:31.260 --> 33:34.172
They think you destroyed it
to make it look like an accident.

33:34.260 --> 33:35.215
Cos it was!

33:35.300 --> 33:38.610
Think very carefully about
what you say from now on, yeah?

33:41.020 --> 33:42.248
I didn't mean it.

33:42.340 --> 33:44.934
I wouldn't do anything to hurt Stan.

33:45.020 --> 33:47.215
I know.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.656
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence...

33:50.740 --> 33:52.139
GROANING

33:52.220 --> 33:53.335
(Monica) Oh, yeah...

33:53.420 --> 33:55.058
Deeper, Frank!

33:55.140 --> 33:56.778
Yeah! Go deeper!

33:56.860 --> 33:58.373
Just try not to make a mess.

33:58.460 --> 34:00.052
Yeah, yeah... Yeah, that's it!

34:00.140 --> 34:02.813
Oh, oh, oh, God! Oh, God!

34:02.900 --> 34:04.891
Oh... Oh! Oh, baby!

34:04.980 --> 34:07.335
(Frank) Yeah, baby. Who's back on form?

34:07.420 --> 34:09.853
(Monica) No! Baby, baby - it's comin'!

34:09.940 --> 34:12.898
Oh, God!
I'm so charging double for this!

34:15.500 --> 34:18.969
- Frank, where you goin'?
- Fetch...

34:19.060 --> 34:21.369
Fetching the kids, moral support!

34:21.460 --> 34:23.893
But I want <i>you</i> there!

34:23.980 --> 34:27.449
Oh, fuck it. Take me to hospital,
I'm havin' a baby.

34:27.540 --> 34:29.018
GROWLS

34:29.100 --> 34:30.692
SIREN BLARES

34:32.699 --> 34:36.978
OK, deep breaths. It will pass.
So when did your waters break?

34:37.060 --> 34:41.018
Erm... Oh, a bit ago. This afternoon.

34:41.100 --> 34:43.136
How far apart are your contractions?

34:43.219 --> 34:45.415
Not very, but me tummy's going
like a tumble dryer,

34:45.500 --> 34:48.060
so something's movin'.

34:48.139 --> 34:51.449
Oh, girls!
You're just in time - baby's comin'.

34:51.540 --> 34:53.371
No, it's not! You're not in labour!

34:53.460 --> 34:57.373
- What?!
- Excuse me! I know what labour feels like!

34:57.460 --> 35:01.009
Your waters haven't broken,
you're not dilated, you're wasting my time.

35:01.100 --> 35:03.091
D'you know how many women
are out there, waiting to drop?!

35:03.180 --> 35:06.809
I know my body, and I've been pooing
non-stop! That's a sign!

35:06.900 --> 35:10.415
Yeah, of gut rot.
What you been eatin'?

35:10.500 --> 35:12.377
Chicken Madras and castor oil.

35:12.460 --> 35:14.291
Out!

35:14.380 --> 35:16.132
Fuckin' lot of you!

35:30.060 --> 35:34.292
- Won't be a minute.
- What's happened?! Does he know? Tom!

35:39.260 --> 35:41.820
No! Stan!

35:43.420 --> 35:44.853
Please!

35:46.540 --> 35:49.418
I'm not a good sarge.

35:49.500 --> 35:51.695
Nobody could have predicted
that Stan'd get shot.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.340
You reacted like a sarge. You did good.

35:56.340 --> 35:58.217
Shall we do this?

35:58.300 --> 35:59.699
SOBS

36:03.020 --> 36:07.730
Yvonne, he's fine.
Tom was just with him in hospital.

36:07.820 --> 36:10.653
The man's a hero.
Deserves a commendation for what he did.

36:15.860 --> 36:18.055
The masked robber just panicked
and did one.

36:18.140 --> 36:19.209
Irony of ironies

36:19.300 --> 36:22.451
that the gun goes off when Yvonne
hands it to me for safekeepin'.

36:23.620 --> 36:24.814
You're free to go.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.936
Really?!

36:27.020 --> 36:29.580
- Oh, can I see him?
- Ward E, third floor.

36:34.580 --> 36:38.539
Oh, go on - buy your old man a pint, son.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.292
You run out of Carl's savings?

36:40.380 --> 36:43.099
SARCASTIC LAUGHTER

36:43.180 --> 36:46.695
I would just like to wet
my new baby's head.

36:46.780 --> 36:47.735
What?!

36:47.820 --> 36:51.210
Your mum's at the hospital,
she's probably had it by now.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.336
No labour at that age -
slips out like a wet pig.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.650
Carl! Mum's had a baby!

36:55.740 --> 36:58.049
Get in! Double celebration!

36:58.140 --> 37:00.700
What?

37:00.780 --> 37:02.338
Dick's signed up.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.853
Army.

37:07.020 --> 37:08.499
Right.

37:08.580 --> 37:10.298
Well...

37:10.380 --> 37:14.134
he can sign up all he wants,
he's never gonna pass his medical.

37:14.220 --> 37:18.611
Fuck off! Fit as, me. Six-minute miler.
Could lift you and you.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.533
That's as may be,
but what you gonna do

37:21.620 --> 37:24.373
when the bombs
and the strobes go off?

37:24.460 --> 37:27.372
You start twitching,
going all 'king Joy Division?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.496
You what?!

37:29.580 --> 37:30.808
Got bad wiring, kid.

37:32.420 --> 37:34.217
Epileptic.

37:34.300 --> 37:36.052
No, I'm not.

37:36.140 --> 37:37.573
SCOFFS

37:37.660 --> 37:40.379
You were on my shoulders
at that first episode.

37:40.460 --> 37:43.930
The lights are flashing
and you're fucking jerking.

37:44.020 --> 37:46.932
The other ravers were copying
all your moves.

37:47.020 --> 37:48.851
Till you started foamin'.

37:48.940 --> 37:51.534
You're lying.
How come I can't remember?

37:51.620 --> 37:54.088
Well, you don't, do you?

37:54.180 --> 37:56.853
That's the nature of the storm.

37:56.940 --> 37:59.500
It comes, it goes...

37:59.580 --> 38:01.298
"Did that happen?"

38:03.860 --> 38:05.578
It's a blessin'...

38:05.660 --> 38:06.854
actually.

38:06.940 --> 38:08.931
Shit! >

38:09.020 --> 38:11.454
Shit!

38:11.540 --> 38:13.815
You happy, now?!

38:15.860 --> 38:19.011
I mean, I'm fairly sure it was him.

38:19.100 --> 38:20.692
It was definitely one of you.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.969
Go on, Captain Ale. Give us a thing.

38:26.060 --> 38:29.496
I didn't tell you about Kash because...

38:29.580 --> 38:30.979
I don't wanna think about him.

38:31.060 --> 38:33.574
Not because I don't trust you,

38:33.660 --> 38:36.572
not because you're a copper,
not because we're not there yet.

38:36.660 --> 38:39.970
It's fine, Yvonne. Don't worry.

38:42.860 --> 38:44.373
God! You look shit, Stan!

38:44.460 --> 38:46.337
Thanks.

38:46.420 --> 38:47.978
Is it sore?

38:48.060 --> 38:50.528
I won't be spraying under there for a while.

38:50.620 --> 38:52.099
So they were actually in school, then?

38:52.180 --> 38:55.172
Yep. Catching up. Homework club.

38:55.260 --> 38:57.728
Right. Talk to me about RE.

38:57.820 --> 39:02.291
Well... it's the teacher, innit?
She's a bigot.

39:02.380 --> 39:04.894
She thinks all Musis
wanna blow things up.

39:04.980 --> 39:09.849
She turns the whole class against me.
I get abuse - that's why I've been jibbin'.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.135
Fine. Drop it. Do something else.

39:12.220 --> 39:15.337
You're doin' it again!
I don't wanna swap subjects.

39:15.420 --> 39:17.138
I like RE.

39:18.740 --> 39:20.014
Well, what do you want?

39:20.100 --> 39:23.297
Can you talk to her? Tell her to give me
a break, without getting dark.

39:23.380 --> 39:25.052
Course I can.

39:25.140 --> 39:29.258
I'd better get another teacher in there
as well, though, just in case.

39:29.340 --> 39:32.776
So what are these posh snaps like, then?

39:32.860 --> 39:36.216
They're good.
They're really nice. Professional.

39:36.300 --> 39:38.768
It's amazing what an airbrush can do!

39:38.860 --> 39:40.418
Are they worth two grand?

39:40.500 --> 39:44.209
Good portfolio, better-paid assignments.
It's a no-brainer.

39:44.300 --> 39:48.373
OK. But until you've earned
your fortune on the catwalk,

39:48.460 --> 39:51.099
you'll be working weekends
in the shop and settling up with me.

39:51.180 --> 39:54.092
What?! That'll take forever!

39:54.180 --> 39:56.250
If you can't do the time...

39:56.340 --> 39:58.331
Fine.

40:04.340 --> 40:06.774
Baby just wasn't ready to come out.

40:06.860 --> 40:10.250
Monica, love, do you want something
for the stress?

40:10.340 --> 40:12.649
Can you leave me alone, please?

40:12.740 --> 40:15.493
I want to have a row
with the father of my baby.

40:23.060 --> 40:26.097
Well, go on. Get it over with,
cos I've a bottle full of excuses.

40:26.180 --> 40:27.898
- You've let me down!
- Oh, fucking...

40:27.980 --> 40:30.699
We were supposed to be
doing this together. It ain't easy.

40:30.780 --> 40:34.375
You're a... You'll be fine.
You're a total fuckin' pro.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.769
You've raised more babies
than Old Mother Hubbard.

40:36.860 --> 40:41.092
Yeah, but I need help with this one.
I'm asking you to be there for us.

40:41.180 --> 40:43.375
Oh, fucking... Monica, I've told you...

40:43.460 --> 40:48.898
You know this, I'm fuckin' useless
at, you know, at this stage...

40:48.980 --> 40:52.450
Delicate little things, you know?
What can I do?

40:52.540 --> 40:54.895
Loads! You can bath it,

40:54.980 --> 40:59.178
you can change its nappy,
you can shove a bottle in its mouth...

40:59.260 --> 41:00.978
- I know!
- It's a baby, Frank.

41:01.060 --> 41:03.972
It's not gonna eat you. It needs you.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.972
I know. What d'you think I've been
doing all these fuckin' years?

41:07.060 --> 41:10.689
Just do what comes... naturally.

41:10.780 --> 41:12.577
- Nat? Yeah.
- I told you that.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.775
All right. I know.

41:17.860 --> 41:20.135
(I know.)

41:21.220 --> 41:26.055
I know! Go across the road to Tina Brown
and ask if we can borrow her paddling pool,

41:26.140 --> 41:28.700
cos I think I might try
one of them water births.

41:28.780 --> 41:30.532
I could wear me gold bikini!

41:30.620 --> 41:32.531
Well, go on!

41:32.620 --> 41:35.088
We need to practise.

41:35.180 --> 41:39.537
We have to be ready,
cos baby could come any day now.

41:45.660 --> 41:48.618
Yvonne Toni-Marie Karib,

41:48.700 --> 41:53.137
I know you're set in your ways
and I've still got a lot to learn about you,

41:53.220 --> 41:57.691
but from this day on, I promise
I won't make any big surprises,

41:57.780 --> 41:59.498
or make any big demands on you.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.298
For fear of being shot?

42:01.380 --> 42:02.495
Absolutely.

42:02.580 --> 42:03.979
OK, it's my go.

42:04.060 --> 42:06.972
Stanley Dennis Waterman,

42:07.060 --> 42:09.813
I know that you tend to...

42:09.900 --> 42:11.652
dive into stuff...

42:11.740 --> 42:13.970
It's a fair assumption,
I'll give you that one.

42:14.060 --> 42:19.259
But from this day on, I'll try to be
more open to what you're divin' into.

42:19.340 --> 42:20.455
Thank you.

42:20.540 --> 42:23.816
Come on - this is painful!

42:23.900 --> 42:25.458
Cut to the chase!

42:36.340 --> 42:38.615
As a token of my commitment to you,

42:38.700 --> 42:41.214
I give you this new four-pack
of pants from George.

42:41.300 --> 42:43.450
Snazzy!

42:43.540 --> 42:47.169
As a symbol of my desire
to stay over one extra night a week

42:47.260 --> 42:48.488
and call you my girlfriend.

42:50.540 --> 42:54.897
And as a token of mine, I'll find
a place for them in my drawer.

42:56.460 --> 42:58.337
- Unless you want one of your own.
- Really?!

42:58.420 --> 43:03.653
Relationships are all about
making sacrifices, right?

43:05.340 --> 43:08.457
But don't think I'm washing
your mucky kecks! I draw the line.

43:12.620 --> 43:15.578
HUBBUB

43:17.980 --> 43:19.777
Shit!

43:22.220 --> 43:25.735
You didn't tell 'em you have fits?!
You're an idiot! They'll find out.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.856
You don't lie to the military.

43:27.940 --> 43:29.692
I had a good chat with my careers adviser.

43:29.780 --> 43:33.375
Doing the job I've always wanted,
shock and awe.

43:33.460 --> 43:34.893
Hit it!

43:34.980 --> 43:37.972
MUSIC: Nineteen by Paul Hardcastle

43:38.060 --> 43:39.539
GIRLS SCREAM

43:47.620 --> 43:52.535
Dozens of girls are touching you up.
Passions are running high!

43:55.100 --> 43:56.453
Chances are...

43:57.980 --> 43:59.652
...you might not get out alive.

44:08.580 --> 44:10.491
What would you do fuckin' do, eh?

44:12.020 --> 44:13.089
GUNSHOT

44:21.860 --> 44:25.614
(Carl) 'Course, the irony of people
who can't commit

44:25.700 --> 44:31.252
'is most of them are already on their way

44:46.980 --> 44:48.652

I'm leaking. I'm leaking!

44:51.740 --> 44:55.130
That means I'll be able to give her the boob!

44:55.220 --> 44:56.858
That's disgustin'!

45:02.220 --> 45:03.573
