I'd take you bowling, right?

16:53.430 --> 16:54.761
Let's go.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.051
Mom. Are you coming?

17:08.069 --> 17:11.561
All I want is to smile
at my boy on his birthday
and I can't even do that.

17:11.656 --> 17:16.400
They said it's just gonna
take a little while for
the medication to level out.

17:16.828 --> 17:19.945
| just don't know how
much longer I can do this.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.948
I wanna say
things'll get better.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.452
But I know how
that sounds.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.465
But the truth is,
they will.

18:07.170 --> 18:09.161
You know,
it's been a month,

18:09.256 --> 18:11.998
and you still haven't
told me your name.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.675
Please. ljust want
to be left alone.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.469
Right, you came
to the right place.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.844
l have to warn you, though,
it does get a bit old.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.768
You were living
a perfectly ordinary life

18:29.693 --> 18:33.481
until one day
you discovered you
could do incredible things.

18:34.364 --> 18:39.108
I bet it was wonderful at
first, and you thought perhaps
you could save the world.

18:40.245 --> 18:44.079
And then you realized,
tragically, that
you were dangerous.

18:46.334 --> 18:49.076
Why don't you talk to me
after a decade?

18:50.213 --> 18:52.670
Actually, talk to me
after three.

18:54.009 --> 18:57.718
If they want to leave me
in here forever,
that's fine by me.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.967
You've been through
something awful,
haven't you?

19:04.311 --> 19:05.642
I'm sorry.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.485
l'm Peter.

19:18.616 --> 19:21.608
Hello, Peter.
It's nice to meet you.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.510

20:08.958 --> 20:10.164
(EXHALES)

20:10.251 --> 20:14.210
it's been two months now
and I still don't know
anything about you.

20:14.297 --> 20:16.504
l was just thinking
maybe there was
more to you

20:16.591 --> 20:19.549
than the whole sadistic
lightning thing, that's all.

20:19.636 --> 20:20.876
What's your story?

20:20.970 --> 20:23.928
I liked you better
when you just laid there.

20:25.266 --> 20:27.678
So, you're not
gonna tell me?

20:27.977 --> 20:29.808
What are you, afraid?

20:30.188 --> 20:31.394
No.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.605
You just like
to be in control.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.691
| get it.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.238
Figured as much.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.938
Sorry I asked.
It won't happen again.

20:50.166 --> 20:54.159
I accidentally set
my grandmother's house
on fire when l was six.

20:54.462 --> 20:58.171
Caused a blackout
in four counties in Ohio
when l was eight.

20:59.300 --> 21:03.589
I spent my ninth birthday
in a glass room with an IV
of lithium in my arm.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.756
I've lived in this
building for 16 years,

21:07.851 --> 21:12.470
ever since the shrinks
diagnosed me as a sociopath
with paranoid delusions.

21:13.148 --> 21:17.187
But, they were just out
to get me because
I threatened to kill them.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.690
I'm 24 years old and
I've never gone on a date.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.864
Never been on
a roller coaster.
Never been swimming.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.326
And now you know everything
there is to know about me.

21:28.413 --> 21:32.156
I don't have the luxury
of being more
interesting than that.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.743
Later, alligator.

21:43.553 --> 21:45.544

Word to the wise, friend.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.846
lwould keep
my distance from that one.

21:50.185 --> 21:54.019
l caved in a desperate moment
six years ago and I'm
still paying the price.

21:54.105 --> 21:55.481
Don't worry.

21:55.565 --> 21:58.682
I don't want anything
from her except the drugs.

21:58.902 --> 22:02.360
I'm sorry, I keep forgetting.
You still believe them.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.696
What do you mean?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.239
This cure of theirs.

22:07.744 --> 22:12.158
They've been days away
from perfecting it
since I got here 30 years ago.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.407
Bob's not trying
to fix you, Peter.

22:16.711 --> 22:20.169
No. They created
this facility to help us.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.256
You're not in
a facility, Peter.

22:24.135 --> 22:25.591
Look around.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.968
You're in prison.

22:28.973 --> 22:32.261
You don't believe me?
Why don't you try
getting out?

22:52.956 --> 22:54.446
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.036
(DOOR CLOSING)

23:09.973 --> 23:11.759
Are you
all right?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.636
He said it
was all a lie.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.515
What happened to him
and to Peter and...

23:19.399 --> 23:21.014
The car crash...

23:21.484 --> 23:24.567
I take it he told you
he thought he could fly.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.187
And the plot to
blow up New York.

23:27.282 --> 23:29.147
That Peter
was a bomb.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.237
It must be
the pain medication.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.655
You deserve
to know this.

23:37.458 --> 23:40.666
I tried to keep it
from you and the boys...

23:41.004 --> 23:42.164
What?

23:43.673 --> 23:47.006
There's a dark secret
in the Petrelli family.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.131
It started with
their father,

23:51.222 --> 23:53.884
delusions of grandeur,
paranoia.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.142
It led to
his suicide, sadly.

24:00.315 --> 24:03.182
That disease has obviously
been passed down.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.684
My God.

24:06.821 --> 24:07.810
(SOBBING) Now,

24:10.074 --> 24:11.905
Nathan's a great man.

24:12.118 --> 24:15.155
And his life
is going to be
very complicated.

24:15.663 --> 24:20.248
He really deserves
his dignity and his...
His privacy.

24:22.337 --> 24:27.331
So I hope you understand
that this has to be
kept secret.

24:32.388 --> 24:35.004
Can I count on you
for that, Heidi?

24:43.107 --> 24:45.268
Hi. What can I do
to get you inside a...

24:45.360 --> 24:46.349

24:51.324 --> 24:52.484
(LAUGHING)
Hi, what can I do...

24:52.575 --> 24:56.409
(LAUGHING) Depends on what
you're gonna do to me
once you get me inside.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.865

about your first day.

would work out.

ran away to LA. and told
everyone to call you Gina?

I can handle you.

taking your meds?

half the east coast.

26:41.267 --> 26:44.384

with some drugs, and I'll
be back before they wear off.

ready for that yet.

someone out with me.

If they're not
going to help us,
why are we here?

To keep us
from being out there.

we're dangerous?

had curing powers,
I could help.

they put you
in here?

to kill me, they would have.
I assure you.

of my blood could
help to heal him.
