WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:03.358
Previously on The Good Wife:

00:03.400 --> 00:04.765
You want me to testify
at his bail hearing?

00:04.800 --> 00:07.439
We need to show the judge
that Peter will have a safe,

00:07.470 --> 00:10.439
stable living situation
if he's out on bail, and that

00:10.470 --> 00:12.108
he will be welcomed home.

00:12.140 --> 00:14.335
Dad told us he made mistakes.
Yeah, but not that.

00:14.380 --> 00:15.779
What's next for
Peter Florrick?

00:15.810 --> 00:17.641
I gotta go into that
courtroom in the next

00:17.680 --> 00:19.568
few weeks and
win this appeal.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.678
Bail is hereby denied.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.109
This court is adjourned.
(gavelbangs)

00:23.150 --> 00:25.789
Peter didn't make bail.

00:25.820 --> 00:28.687
My next guest has spent
quality time with some

00:28.720 --> 00:31.518
of the biggest political names
in Chicago politics,

00:31.560 --> 00:34.620
and she's working
on a shocking tell-all book.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.663
Please welcome Amber Madison.

00:37.700 --> 00:39.668
(applause)

00:41.670 --> 00:44.662
Hi, how are you?
So nice to meet you.

00:44.710 --> 00:45.665
(Amber laughs)

00:45.710 --> 00:47.337
So this D.A....
Mm-hmm.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.438
Now, did he...?

00:48.480 --> 00:50.539
Uh, state's attorney.
Okay.

00:50.580 --> 00:51.672
Right, whatever,
this D.A....

00:51.710 --> 00:52.677
(laughs)
So now,

00:52.720 --> 00:54.574
did he, um, suck on your toes

00:54.620 --> 00:57.339
all the time or was that
just, like, a one-time shot?

00:57.390 --> 00:58.812
It was a... two-time thing.
(audience laughing)

00:58.850 --> 00:59.748
CHELSEA:
Well, of course,

00:59.790 --> 01:01.655
I mean, once you shrimp
on somebody once,

01:01.690 --> 01:04.750
you kind of have to follow up
with another sucking session.

01:04.790 --> 01:06.655
And what's
the most disgusting thing

01:06.700 --> 01:08.554
that he ever asked you
to do to him?

01:08.600 --> 01:11.091
Uh, well...

01:11.130 --> 01:12.336
Like really,
really disgusting.

01:12.370 --> 01:14.429
It wasn't _
the most disgusting,

01:14.470 --> 01:16.836
but he...

01:16.870 --> 01:18.508
ZACH:
Oh...

01:18.540 --> 01:22.704
ALICIA:
Kids, breakfast!

01:22.750 --> 01:23.739
This is something new

01:23.780 --> 01:25.577
I found at the market.

01:25.610 --> 01:26.747
It's called fruit.

01:26.780 --> 01:28.645
I thought we'd give it
a try this morning.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.840
You're really happy
this morning.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.778
Yes, I started drinking earlier.

01:34.390 --> 01:36.688
Okay, something is going on.

01:36.730 --> 01:39.255
No, we just have
to get to school.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.619
Yeah.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.627
Love you, Mom.

01:41.660 --> 01:44.697
Love you, too.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.691
WOMAN:
Look, Amber Madison
is yesterday's news.

01:48.740 --> 01:49.502
Thank you.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.303
She'd say anything
to sell a book.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.500
It doesn't warrant a comment.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.337
MAN:
Miss Poole, he's
not in court.

01:54.380 --> 01:55.779
I put him in
the jury room.

01:55.810 --> 01:56.606
Thank you.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.180
I don't think
we'll need damage control.

02:02.220 --> 02:03.312
It's just
gossip page fodder.

02:03.350 --> 02:06.148
I'm not getting
political calls.

02:06.190 --> 02:07.589
Who's he...?
GOLDEN:
He's trying his wife.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.781
I usually don't ask this,
but how much is true?

02:10.690 --> 02:12.294
From what I can tell,
not much.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.354
So what are we dealing with?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.719
A call girl stretching
her 15 minutes

02:14.760 --> 02:15.727
to 20 or...?

02:15.760 --> 02:16.624
Or...?

02:16.670 --> 02:18.467
I had a married client
who had a girlfriend

02:18.500 --> 02:20.229
who wouldn't go away.
She kept making trouble

02:20.270 --> 02:21.737
at inopportune moments.

02:21.770 --> 02:24.807
We offered her money,
a singing contract, everything.

02:24.840 --> 02:25.568
It turns out
she wanted

02:25.610 --> 02:27.669
something I couldn't
offer her--

02:27.710 --> 02:28.608
my client.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.507
She was in love with him
and she was bitter.

02:31.550 --> 02:33.370
Is that a possibility here?

02:33.420 --> 02:34.773
Why don't
you ask him?

02:34.820 --> 02:35.741
PETER:
Yes.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.884
This is her husband.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.549
Could you tell her to call me
as quickly as possible?

02:41.590 --> 02:43.251
Thank you.

02:43.290 --> 02:44.723
Are you okay?
No.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.320
That's good, the genuine
is important right now.
Kya.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.726
Unless you can get me
in touch with my wife,

02:49.770 --> 02:50.794
I think you should shut up.

02:54.770 --> 02:58.831
(ringing)

02:58.870 --> 03:01.304
Your husband phoned.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.843
My...? Oh, did he say
what it was about?

03:03.880 --> 03:08.544
No, but I-I think he thought
you'd know what it was about.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.684
Oh.

03:10.720 --> 03:11.789
And someone from Page Six--

03:11.820 --> 03:13.412
he phoned,
wanting comment.

03:13.460 --> 03:14.415
On?

03:14.460 --> 03:15.518
He didn't say.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.720
I don't think
it was about a case.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.250
CARY:
Courtney,

03:18.290 --> 03:19.655
you got a minute?

03:22.430 --> 03:24.569
What's going on?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.431
Courtney.

03:27.600 --> 03:28.794
Just wait.

03:30.870 --> 03:33.634
(typing)

03:33.680 --> 03:35.636
CHELSEA:
So now we're getting to a
comfortable place. Thank you.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.840
Now, what kind of code

03:36.880 --> 03:39.314
are we talking about here?

03:39.350 --> 03:40.977
Uh, well,
I would call Peter's house

03:41.020 --> 03:43.682
and hang up after one ring,
and then he would know

03:43.720 --> 03:45.745
that the next call was going
to be from me.

03:45.790 --> 03:46.859
CHELSEA:
Are you 14?

03:46.890 --> 03:47.652
No, I mean, you're a call girl.
(audience laughing)

03:47.690 --> 03:50.750
I mean, that just
sounds pretty...

03:50.790 --> 03:53.350
Aanay,
so about that threesome...

03:53.400 --> 03:54.355
(laughter)

03:54.400 --> 03:55.424
Um, it was nothing.

03:55.460 --> 03:56.859
It-- he said
that it was the reason

03:56.900 --> 03:58.720
that he came to me
In the first place.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.864
His wife wouldn't agree
to a threesome.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.403
I think he thought
that she was a little...

04:04.440 --> 04:06.533
Frigid.
You can say it.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.674
I mean, everyone-- I-I've seen
her, I think she looks frigid.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.677
I mean, I know frigid

04:10.710 --> 04:13.349
and-- see, there's a lesson here
for everybody.

04:13.380 --> 04:16.383
When your spouse asks you
for a threesome...

04:16.420 --> 04:19.014
And he offered you a job,
is that right?

04:19.050 --> 04:21.018
Yes, on his campaign.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.756
Um, he said that he was going
to divorce his wife

04:23.790 --> 04:27.749
and that I would work as part of
his outreach for at-risk kids.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.495
CHELSEA:
And you believed him?

04:29.530 --> 04:31.521
(knocking)

04:31.570 --> 04:33.299
I'm sorry, Will and Diane
need you upstairs.

04:33.340 --> 04:36.867
AMBER: _
Peter was very compassnonate,

04:36.910 --> 04:38.866
um, very loving,

04:38.910 --> 04:41.606
a very, very good lover.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.544
(paralegals murmuring
and chuckling)

05:00.430 --> 05:02.466
DIANE:
We need to do
damage control.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.058
WILL:
This is beyond
damage control.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.897
DIANE:
Don't let's get
into that now, please.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.989
What? We_ can't
just let this Sit.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.564
You're like Fletcher Christian

05:09.610 --> 05:11.828
just itching
to throw Bligh overboard.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.599
Yes, and Mr. Christian
was the hero.

05:13.640 --> 05:14.777
Here.

05:14.810 --> 05:16.846
NEWSCASTER:
Attorneys at Stern,
Lockhart & Gardner

05:16.880 --> 05:19.474
have had no comment
on this latest embarrassment.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.978
It appears that Jonas Stern's
single car accident

05:23.020 --> 05:24.044
caused no injuries.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.650
Stern, Chicago's renowned
civil rights attorney,

05:26.690 --> 05:28.510
first gained notoriety

05:28.560 --> 05:30.983
crusading against
police brutality in the 1970s.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.122
It's unbelievable.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.924
Guy hasn't stepped foot
in the office for over a year...

05:34.960 --> 05:36.097
I talked to
his ex-wife.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.620
Which one?

05:37.670 --> 05:38.694
Cassandra.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.789
She said spending
so much time away mellowed him.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.967
Yep, like rotting fruit.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.534
Remember, he spoke at school?

05:44.570 --> 05:46.731
He filled

05:46.780 --> 05:48.839
Hart auditorium, Diane,
on-- what was it?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.508
Universal jurisdiction.

05:51.550 --> 05:53.745
Stern used a glass of water
and a hammer

05:53.780 --> 05:55.475
to demonstrate
the difference between...

05:55.520 --> 05:57.841
International norms
versus state sovereignty.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.154
Right, you were really into him.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.579
I found him inspiring.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.053
WILL:
Well, he wanted
to thank you.

06:05.090 --> 06:06.921
Me?
Yeah.

06:06.960 --> 06:10.088
The slip and fall,
his daughter's defense.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.722
I guess she spoke highly of you.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.590
He's on his
way over.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.666
Oh, good, Julius Kreutzer
has agreed to handle the DUI.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.735
Kreutzer? Great.

06:18.770 --> 06:19.873
We'll need to enlarge
the conference room.

06:19.910 --> 06:20.934
He's the only
lawyer I know

06:20.980 --> 06:22.504
with an ego bigger
than Stern's.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.802
We need this to go away quietly.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.944
Diane, have you ever known Stern
to do anything quietly?

06:27.980 --> 06:29.914
(elevator bell dings)

06:29.950 --> 06:31.110
(singsongy):
Jeanette!

06:31.150 --> 06:32.959
Oh, it's so good
to see you!

06:32.990 --> 06:34.014
Oh, baby.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.015
How you doing?

06:35.060 --> 06:37.051
Oh, you're as beautiful
as ever, sweetheart.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.682
Hey, Mike, Arnie,
how you doing?

06:38.730 --> 06:40.197
Good to see you.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.959
Where the hell did we get that?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.695
That's the ugliest thing
I've ever seen.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.924
But you haven't lived

06:44.970 --> 06:47.859
until you've ridden horseback
at midnight

06:47.900 --> 06:50.698
across the Timihani Plateau.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.105
Oh, my God.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.005
Here.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.543
Who buys this stuff?

06:56.580 --> 06:59.071
(chuckles)

07:01.080 --> 07:02.889
My partners!

07:02.920 --> 07:04.547
(laughter)

07:04.590 --> 07:05.989
Hey.
How are you, lovely?

07:08.990 --> 07:11.083
So, have you two
bankrupted us yet?

07:11.130 --> 07:12.859
Nope, you're doing
that all on your own.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.197
Worry beads.

07:14.230 --> 07:16.528
They were carved
by a 70-year-old

07:16.570 --> 07:18.197
Balinese woman.

07:18.230 --> 07:19.197
Wear them,

07:19.230 --> 07:20.663
and you'll never lose
in court.

07:20.700 --> 07:21.860
Thanks.

07:21.900 --> 07:25.631
For you, my clear,
a Chinese perfume jar

07:25.670 --> 07:29.208
said to contain the soul
of a Ming Dynasty poet.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.471
Funny, I was looking
for a Ming poet at Barneys.

07:32.520 --> 07:33.873
Jonas, this is...
So, where is

07:33.920 --> 07:36.047
that jackass Kreutzer?

07:37.220 --> 07:39.757
WILL:
It's over, you know that.

07:39.790 --> 07:40.984
I don't know
anything.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.180
His clients _
are g0ing to mutiny.

07:42.220 --> 07:43.824
Stern's clients
understand

07:43.860 --> 07:45.555
his proclivities.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.955
It's a new
economy, Diane.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.627
He's a managing
partner, Will.

07:48.660 --> 07:49.820
It would take a vote

07:49.870 --> 07:51.121
of the general partnership
to oust him.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.637
Which half are itching to do.

07:52.670 --> 07:54.137
This DUI
is giving them cause.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.569
Have some respect.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.659
Mr. Stern would like
to speak to you two.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.938
He fired you.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.733
I'll bill you for an hour.

08:00.780 --> 08:02.748
I'm thinking
of defending myself.

08:02.780 --> 08:05.101
Jonas, you are not going
to defend yourself.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.778
It's trumped up,
you know that.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.038
All that time I spent on
the Police Review Board,

08:10.090 --> 08:13.287
the Chicago cops can't wait
to knock me down a peg.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.015
This is
your second offense.

08:15.060 --> 08:18.985
Ah, worst-case scenario, I
lose my license for a year.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.157
Were you drinking, Jonas?

08:21.200 --> 08:24.192
Four Scotch and sodas.

08:24.230 --> 08:25.822
I was blitzed.
(chuckles)

08:25.870 --> 08:28.191
After the accident.

08:29.070 --> 08:30.901
I crashed, I
was shook up.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.738
I walked into the
Westwood Tavern

08:33.780 --> 08:35.202
and downed down four
Scotch and sodas.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.003
Oh, God.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.848
The police are going to
have a hard time discerning

08:39.880 --> 08:42.940
the drinking I did before
and the drinking I did after.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.582
You're like an 18-year-old.

08:44.620 --> 08:45.609
Is that her--

08:45.650 --> 08:47.049
the state's
attorney's Wife,

08:47.090 --> 08:48.182
the one that defended
my daughter?

08:48.220 --> 08:50.620
Yes.

08:52.660 --> 08:55.322
I want her.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.759
I want her as a front.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.121
I'll defend myself through her.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.335
This is a bad idea, Jonas.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.167
I want her

09:04.210 --> 09:06.166
to represent me.

09:07.280 --> 09:11.273
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

09:23.360 --> 09:25.328
Okay, this won't take long.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.588
It's okay,

09:26.630 --> 09:27.597
Mom, really.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.097
No one's saying anything.

09:29.130 --> 09:32.327
All right, well, then,
just listen for my sake.

09:32.370 --> 09:36.761
I want you to know
what's true and what's not.

09:36.810 --> 09:39.301
I don't know what your father
told this woman,

09:39.340 --> 09:44.141
and I can't stop her
from saying what she's saying,

09:44.180 --> 09:46.819
but I can always tell you
the truth,

09:46.850 --> 09:49.683
and none of this
is true.

09:49.720 --> 09:50.914
Thanks, Mom.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.616
What does
Dad say is true?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.753
I don't know.

09:56.790 --> 09:57.859
He hasn't talked
to you?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.755
He...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.859
He tried,
but I haven't returned his call.

10:01.900 --> 10:02.867
Why?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.663
I don't know.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.895
I've... I've been angry.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.829
But if it's untrue...

10:09.870 --> 10:11.337
It's still true
that he slept with her.

10:11.370 --> 10:12.906
Yeah, but he already
apologized for that.

10:12.940 --> 10:14.373
It doesn't make it
any less wrong.

10:14.410 --> 10:15.809
Okay, okay, it was my mistake.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.671
I should have called him back
and I will.

10:17.710 --> 10:18.677
I will talk to your dad.

10:18.710 --> 10:20.177
Why don't we
talk to him,

10:20.220 --> 10:21.175
ask him
everything?

10:21.220 --> 10:24.041
What, like if he had
a three-way?

10:24.090 --> 10:25.739
It's not a three-way,
it's a threesome.

10:25.790 --> 10:27.087
Yeah, but you can
still say "three-way."

10:27.120 --> 10:28.610
No, you can't.
Okay.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.724
Family meeting's over.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.130
It's a plea is all.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.904
You'll be fine,
Mrs. Florrick.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.760
I'll tell you
exactly what to say.

10:45.810 --> 10:47.232
Could you tell me now?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.406
No.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.672
The best arguments
are spontaneous.

10:52.720 --> 10:53.709
You know
who told me that?

10:53.750 --> 10:54.671
Justice Powell--

10:54.720 --> 10:57.848
the oral arguments
for Ricardo v. Ohio.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.312
I did my law
review on Ricardo.

10:59.350 --> 11:02.820
I was brilliant
on Ricardo wasn't I?

11:02.860 --> 11:04.350
You were.

11:05.460 --> 11:09.294
Yeah, it's harder
doing great these days.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.662
Fewer opportunities.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.765
I, uh...
chased you out

11:15.800 --> 11:18.360
of the gossip columns,
didn't I?

11:18.410 --> 11:20.298
Yes. Thank you.

11:22.140 --> 11:25.348
Well, the first time
that a DUI trumped a threesome.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.879
Your Honor, Matan Brody

11:28.920 --> 11:30.740
of the State's
Attorney's Office.

11:32.920 --> 11:35.388
Mr. Stern,
you may want in on this.

11:40.160 --> 11:41.718
The People
have added a charge

11:41.760 --> 11:43.193
to the complaint,
Your Honor.

11:43.230 --> 11:45.198
Aggravated battery
to a police officer.

11:45.230 --> 11:46.834
That's ridiculous.

11:46.870 --> 11:48.189
You tacked that on
for payback.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.832
Are you representing
yourself here,

11:49.870 --> 11:50.837
Mr. Stern?

11:50.870 --> 11:51.962
Your Honor,
this is payback.

11:52.010 --> 11:54.171
It's clearly
unorthodox, clear...
Selective prosecution.

11:54.210 --> 11:56.872
Selective prosecution
in direct...

11:56.910 --> 11:59.242
Contradiction
of the 14th Amendment.
Of the 14th Amendment right

11:59.280 --> 12:01.009
guaranteeing
equal protection.

12:01.050 --> 12:02.813
You hit a cop, Mr. Stern.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.181
You can't
hit a cop.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.414
Speak to me,

12:05.450 --> 12:06.815
not my client, sir.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.452
Aggravated battery is a felony,

12:08.490 --> 12:09.855
Your Honor,
carrying a prison term

12:09.890 --> 12:11.050
of two
to five years.

12:11.090 --> 12:13.354
As such, both this charge
and the DUI

12:13.400 --> 12:15.254
now have to be heard
in felony court.

12:15.300 --> 12:17.029
That's too bad, Mr. Stern.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.992
I was looking forward to this.

12:29.180 --> 12:30.772
Thank you,
Mrs. Florrick.

12:30.810 --> 12:32.471
I can take it from here.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.778
Is that the discovery packet?

12:35.820 --> 12:37.117
It is.

12:37.150 --> 12:38.117
Sir, if I'm
representing you,

12:38.150 --> 12:40.482
I think I should look
at the discovery, too.

12:40.520 --> 12:42.829
Brenda, dinner at Gibson's.

12:42.860 --> 12:43.929
Got it.

12:44.990 --> 12:48.153
Mr. Stern, I heard you
speak at Georgetown once,

12:48.200 --> 12:51.966
and you said, "Even
the best legal mind

12:52.000 --> 12:55.834
requires the Socratic method
to keep itself sharp."

12:56.870 --> 12:58.929
So...

12:58.970 --> 13:00.835
here I am.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.950
ALICIA:
So, you had a few drinks

13:15.990 --> 13:17.321
at the party before
the accident.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.828
I had one drink,
and they don't know that.

13:19.860 --> 13:22.829
Because, after the accident,
you had a few more?

13:22.870 --> 13:25.259
That's perfectly legal.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.063
You blew a .15

13:27.100 --> 13:28.590
on the Breathalyzer
at the police station.

13:28.640 --> 13:29.959
That's almost twice

13:30.010 --> 13:31.864
the legal limit.
They're going to argue...

13:31.910 --> 13:33.275
They're going to argue
that three drinks

13:33.310 --> 13:35.278
wasn't enough to get me there.

13:35.310 --> 13:38.871
And you can argue
traumatic experience.

13:38.910 --> 13:41.117
I was in
an aCCIdent.

13:41.150 --> 13:44.119
That increases the effect
of alcohol dramatically.

13:44.150 --> 13:46.118
And the battery
against the officer?

13:46.150 --> 13:48.550
_No mention of that
in the police report.

13:48.590 --> 13:51.127
Now, these police cars--

13:51.160 --> 13:53.993
they've got their video cameras
right on the dash.

13:54.030 --> 13:56.328
Those recordings are kept
for up to six days.

13:56.360 --> 13:59.591
Subpoena those recordings
before they can erase them.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.064
And get
that dispatch tape.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.965
Ten to one my name
is on it.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.205
Yeah, they knew
it was my car.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.401
They couldn't wait to arrest me.

14:09.910 --> 14:12.208
Let the plotting begin.

14:13.220 --> 14:15.211
You know,
there's something

14:15.250 --> 14:16.569
refreshingly honest
about the Borgias

14:16.620 --> 14:18.588
murdering
their enemies.

14:18.620 --> 14:21.384
Here, we just plot

14:21.420 --> 14:23.479
no confidence votes.

14:30.430 --> 14:31.897
Here it is.

14:31.930 --> 14:32.862
Look.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.061
Thought we were studying
Martin Luther King.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.397
You were studying
Martin Luther King.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.601
See, there's your mother.

14:38.640 --> 14:39.937
I don't get it.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.936
It's a Web site
where you bet on stuff.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.471
You know,
celebrity stuff like, uh,

14:44.510 --> 14:46.171
you know, "Which Disney star
will die first?"

14:46.210 --> 14:47.438
Stuff like that.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.448
So, they're betting on my mom?

14:49.480 --> 14:50.981
If she'll get a divorce.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.011
That's... awful.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.118
(laughs)

14:54.160 --> 14:56.219
So, what should I bet?

14:56.260 --> 14:59.559
You want to know if they're
going to get a divorce?

14:59.590 --> 15:02.093
Yeah. It's like having
insider information.

15:02.130 --> 15:03.529
It's like having somebody
inside Exxon.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.663
See, after this
whole threesome thing,

15:05.700 --> 15:08.464
betting is moving 75%
for divorce.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.968
And I've got 50 bucks, so...?

15:12.010 --> 15:14.069
She's not going to divorce.

15:14.110 --> 15:16.374
You're sure?
I'm sure.

15:16.410 --> 15:19.948
(typing)

15:19.980 --> 15:23.939
So, did your dad really
ask your mom for a threesome?

15:23.990 --> 15:25.981
No.

15:26.020 --> 15:28.659
But they wouldn't tell you
if he did, right?

15:31.060 --> 15:33.153
Did you hear what she said
on Howard Stern?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.599
VVho?

15:34.630 --> 15:36.188
Your dad's hooker.

15:38.230 --> 15:40.164
She said they had sex
in your bed.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.428
She did not.

15:41.470 --> 15:42.494
Yeah, she did.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.030
That's what somebody
in Chemistry said.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.608
So, just think about it.

15:48.640 --> 15:51.074
Right here.

15:52.650 --> 15:54.618
This bed.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.409
It's pretty cool.

15:59.450 --> 16:01.281
It wasn't the same one.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.129
I had a different bed.

16:06.630 --> 16:08.757
What are you, like 14?

16:08.800 --> 16:11.189
Yeah.

16:13.070 --> 16:15.095
Well, I'm 16.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.169
JACKIE:
I'm back, kids.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.279
Hello!

16:21.310 --> 16:22.334
I...

16:22.380 --> 16:24.109
I got to help my grandma.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.174
I'm sorry.

16:26.580 --> 16:28.639
Let me give you something,
Zachary.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.183
Just, you know,
in case your parents

16:31.220 --> 16:33.256
are giving you any trouble,
bothering you,

16:33.290 --> 16:35.485
and you want
something--

16:35.520 --> 16:37.181
some space, a car.

16:37.230 --> 16:40.290
Just, um... play this.

16:42.260 --> 16:43.727
What is it, rap?

16:43.770 --> 16:44.794
(laughing)

16:44.830 --> 16:45.797
No, it's better.

16:45.830 --> 16:47.730
It makes parents give you
whatever you want.

16:47.770 --> 16:51.069
You need a little rebellion
in your life.

17:02.280 --> 17:03.679
It's nice
to meet you,

17:03.720 --> 17:05.381
Mrs. Florrick.
I'm Rebecca.

17:05.420 --> 17:07.559
Zachary and I were
just studying.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.321
Bye.

17:14.130 --> 17:19.124
(Islamic call to prayer
playing over stereo)

17:28.840 --> 17:31.149
Video from the
dashboard camera.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.545
Thanks. Good or bad?

17:32.580 --> 17:34.241
You should watch.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.110
So,

17:35.150 --> 17:37.289
Stern still treating
you like a puppet?

17:37.320 --> 17:39.413
Here's my script.

17:39.450 --> 17:41.315
(knocking)
Alicia, it's...

17:41.360 --> 17:44.056
VVho?
Amber Madison.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.223
She says she... has
a question for you.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.228
Take a message.

17:53.270 --> 17:54.692
Why is she phoning you?

17:54.740 --> 17:55.764
I don't know.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.233
She's trying to cause a scene.

17:57.270 --> 17:58.237
I don't know-- for attention.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.705
You want me to talk to her?

18:05.750 --> 18:07.513
Talk to her?
Mm.

18:08.550 --> 18:10.780
Wh-What would that entail?

18:10.820 --> 18:12.287
Talk.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.212
I'm fine.

18:16.260 --> 18:17.579
Thank you.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.222
Contact me if that changes.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.251
0-... Okay.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.634
Damn it.
You need to
calm down.

18:31.670 --> 18:33.570
Don't make me put the cuffs
back on you.

18:33.610 --> 18:35.601
I said let me go, damn it!

18:35.640 --> 18:37.278
Why did we subpoena
this again?

18:37.310 --> 18:39.301
Don't worry about it.

18:39.350 --> 18:41.238
MATAN:
Is this an
accurate depiction

18:41.280 --> 18:42.611
of the events, Officer Sutton?

18:42.650 --> 18:44.618
Yes, it is.
Your Honor, as
you can see,

18:44.650 --> 18:46.481
the video is clearly relevant.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.182
It may be relevant,
but it's unnecessary

18:49.220 --> 18:51.757
when they have the officer's
testimony, and given...

18:51.790 --> 18:53.826
Yes, Ms. Florrick?

18:53.860 --> 18:55.350
Given the Illinois
State Supreme Court...

18:55.400 --> 18:56.424
The Illinois
Court's ruling

18:56.460 --> 18:57.768
in People v. Harriman,

18:57.800 --> 18:59.290
we believe...

19:00.640 --> 19:01.664
wasn't it, Mr. Stern?

19:01.700 --> 19:03.565
Yes. Yes, Your Honor, it was.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.566
JUDGE:
That case dealt with video
from an outside source.

19:05.610 --> 19:07.407
This is video
from the officer's dashboard.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.829
We're arguing
that the underlying principle

19:09.880 --> 19:10.869
is the same,
Your Honor.

19:10.910 --> 19:12.343
JUDGE:
That might work

19:12.380 --> 19:13.415
with the Illinois Supreme Court,
but not here.

19:13.450 --> 19:14.644
Very good.

19:14.680 --> 19:16.409
We'll reconvene after lunch.

19:16.450 --> 19:17.747
What was that?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.189
You're hesitating.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.188
I don't have time
to be hesitating.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.357
You're interrupting.

19:22.390 --> 19:24.756
Maybe this was a mistake.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.699
They should be
out in a minute.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.230
They're finishing up
pretrial motions.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.332
How many clients do you have?

19:43.380 --> 19:44.574
Currently?

19:44.610 --> 19:46.248
Two.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.577
Who pays you?

19:48.620 --> 19:50.611
A committee
of interested advisors.

19:50.650 --> 19:53.210
And how long
are they paying you?

19:54.320 --> 19:56.754
It's month to month,
but I'd imagine until...

19:56.790 --> 19:59.759
Actually, I'm not sure
how long they'll pay me.

20:01.860 --> 20:03.964
It's not my business

20:04.000 --> 20:06.525
to look into the
future, Mrs. Florrick.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.896
Are there designs
to put Peter back in office?

20:09.940 --> 20:11.430
Yes.

20:11.470 --> 20:13.574
Your husband
is missed.

20:13.610 --> 20:15.703
He was a very effective
state's attorney,

20:15.740 --> 20:17.446
and people want him back.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.471
(door opening)

20:23.390 --> 20:24.880
PETER:
Itsinsane

20:24.920 --> 20:28.651
that I would hire a call girl
to work on my campaign.

20:28.690 --> 20:30.453
Think about it. It's...

20:30.490 --> 20:32.958
She was talking about your
kids at risk program.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.526
(laughs)

20:34.560 --> 20:35.822
Yeah, well, and anyone

20:35.860 --> 20:37.669
who read the news
would know about that.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.338
She's out there.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.760
She's out there, and she
can say whatever she wants,

20:43.810 --> 20:45.630
and there's nothing I can do
to stop her,

20:45.670 --> 20:47.376
because the libel laws
are against us.

20:48.410 --> 20:51.049
She's phoning my work.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.399
VVho?

20:52.450 --> 20:54.975
Your... prostitute

20:55.020 --> 20:56.817
is calling my work.

20:56.850 --> 20:59.341
I told the kids
I'd come here, Peter,

20:59.390 --> 21:01.415
and talk to
you, but I...

21:01.460 --> 21:03.928
I don't know what's right
or wrong anymore.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.724
I don't know what's a lie
or what's the truth.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.796
Ijust...

21:08.830 --> 21:10.559
I can't take this.

21:10.600 --> 21:11.897
Hold on.
No.

21:11.930 --> 21:13.488
I want it to stop.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.895
This is your family.

21:17.100 --> 21:18.499
I don't care about libel laws.

21:18.540 --> 21:19.768
You make it stop.
Make her stop.

21:19.810 --> 21:20.936
What are you saying?

21:29.120 --> 21:30.439
(door slams shut)

21:41.730 --> 21:43.721
(paper rustling)

21:55.610 --> 21:57.601
(sighs)

22:15.000 --> 22:16.524
Oh...

22:20.770 --> 22:22.499
(gasps)

22:23.510 --> 22:25.000
(sighs)

22:46.030 --> 22:48.157
JUDGE:
Unless there's anything else,

22:48.200 --> 22:49.428
I rule that the police
dashboard tape

22:49.460 --> 22:51.098
be considered...
Your Honor.

22:51.130 --> 22:52.427
Yes, Mrs. Florrick?

22:52.470 --> 22:53.562
I have one more thing.

22:53.600 --> 22:54.692
No, you don't.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.594
_ We_move to_
disqualify the Video

22:56.640 --> 22:58.608
on the grounds
that it was obtained

22:58.640 --> 23:00.437
as _the result of
an illegal arrest.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.539
Your Honor, what could
possibly be illegal...
Mr. Stern,

23:02.580 --> 23:03.672
is it your understanding
that the officer...

23:03.710 --> 23:05.644
Your Honor,

23:05.680 --> 23:08.513
I am Mr. Stern's
legal representative.

23:08.550 --> 23:09.972
Yes, ma'am,

23:10.020 --> 23:11.817
but I believe Mr. Stern
has a difference of opinion.

23:11.850 --> 23:14.648
Uh, Mrs. Florrick
and I need five minutes,

23:14.690 --> 23:15.987
Your Honor.
No, we're fine.

23:16.020 --> 23:19.023
Officer Sutton stated
on his dashboard video,

23:19.060 --> 23:21.824
"Don't make me put the
handcuffs back on you."

23:23.100 --> 23:25.193
Implying that he'd been
handcuffed previously.

23:25.230 --> 23:27.198
Did you, Officer Sutton?

23:27.230 --> 23:28.891
I'd handcuffed him
when I found him

23:28.940 --> 23:30.498
in the bar because
he was belligerent,

23:30.540 --> 23:31.700
as you see in the video.

23:31.740 --> 23:33.674
But when I brought
him outside,

23:33.710 --> 23:36.679
I took the cuffs off so I could
perform a sobriety test.

23:36.710 --> 23:37.904
Was Mr. Stern armed?

23:37.950 --> 23:38.575
No.

23:38.610 --> 23:40.146
Did you fear for your life?

23:40.180 --> 23:41.647
No, but, I...

23:41.680 --> 23:43.739
Then it was an arrest,
Your Honor.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.711
Mr. Stern was
not free to go.

23:44.750 --> 23:47.719
And Officer Sutton had
no probable cause--

23:47.760 --> 23:49.557
the mere fact that
it was an accident

23:49.590 --> 23:50.989
does not mean_ a crime
was committed.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.590
So, everything that
follows is tainted--

23:53.630 --> 23:55.552
the sobriety tests,
the video.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.227
Your Honor,
the video captures

23:57.260 --> 23:58.693
the commission
of a subsequent crime--

23:58.730 --> 24:01.233
a battery of a
police officer.

24:01.270 --> 24:03.090
Yeah, yeah,
but it's exactly...

24:03.140 --> 24:05.529
Mr. Stern,
please sit down.

24:09.710 --> 24:11.507
Except that it occurred
during the sobriety tests.

24:11.550 --> 24:12.642
And if the sobriety tests

24:12.680 --> 24:14.671
are disqualified,

24:14.720 --> 24:16.449
the video must
be disqualified.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.986
Motion granted.

24:21.020 --> 24:23.557
The video
is hereby excluded.

24:23.590 --> 24:24.921
We're adjourned until tomorrow.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.622
Well, well,

24:27.660 --> 24:30.026
the best arguments really
do sound spontaneous.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.789
Mr. Stern,

24:31.830 --> 24:35.197
you cannot backseat
drive your own defense.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.196
You chose me to
represent you.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.800
If that is what you
want, I'm your lawyer.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.137
You're my client.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.148
Let's go.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.622
I, uh...

25:00.660 --> 25:03.720
I think you should take
the kids to church more.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.221
Because...?

25:07.270 --> 25:09.636
Zach's listening
to Muslim music.

25:13.070 --> 25:15.072
No, I'm serious.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.634
His girlfriend is Muslim.

25:17.680 --> 25:19.307
Zach's girlfriend?

25:19.350 --> 25:21.215
Yes.
Zach has a girlfriend?

25:21.250 --> 25:21.875
Yes.

25:21.920 --> 25:23.649
They-they were
here yesterday

25:23.690 --> 25:26.079
in his room, and they were
playing that music.

25:27.120 --> 25:29.054
And where were you?

25:29.090 --> 25:31.149
I was out getting groceries.

25:36.930 --> 25:38.921
(knocking on door)

25:42.240 --> 25:44.231
You have a girlfriend?

25:44.270 --> 25:45.737
No.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.237
Who was here yesterday?

25:47.270 --> 25:48.999
Becca.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.678
And Becca isn't your girlfriend?

25:50.710 --> 25:53.099
Uh, she's a friend who's a girl.

25:53.150 --> 25:56.813
And you were in here
working together?

25:56.850 --> 25:58.613
Yeah.

25:58.650 --> 26:00.015
She's helping me out
with Social Studies.

26:00.050 --> 26:01.358
GRACE:
She's a junior!

26:01.390 --> 26:03.085
Shut up! No one asked you!

26:03.120 --> 26:06.157
Don't say "shut up."

26:06.190 --> 26:08.795
She was helping
a freshman?

26:08.830 --> 26:10.297
I'm...

26:10.330 --> 26:11.866
Mom, she's nice.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.060
You'd like her.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.761
Oh, I'm sure I would.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.597
And she is welcome
to study here anytime,

26:16.640 --> 26:18.665
but only when
Jackie is here,

26:18.710 --> 26:20.598
and only in the living room.

26:20.640 --> 26:21.777
But the computer's in here.

26:22.810 --> 26:24.846
Yeah.

26:30.690 --> 26:31.748
Wait, Mom.

26:31.790 --> 26:32.779
Mom, what are you doing?

26:32.820 --> 26:34.811
Here. Carry this.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.714
Come on.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.751
Mom, this is
ridiculous.
(sighs)

26:38.790 --> 26:39.927
Lots of light.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.257
Lots of room.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.699
This is...

26:42.730 --> 26:44.197
Mom, I want my privacy.

26:44.230 --> 26:46.698
And you'll have that
when you're 18.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.936
This is...

26:47.970 --> 26:49.961
Nothing happened.
Good.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.729
Would you like my desk lamp?

26:51.770 --> 26:53.362
You don't trust me.

26:53.410 --> 26:55.378
Zach, you're 14 years old.

26:55.410 --> 26:57.071
You are a freshman
in high school.

26:57.110 --> 26:58.873
You had a junior
in your room yesterday

26:58.910 --> 27:00.138
with the door closed.

27:00.180 --> 27:02.774
This is _what is called
parenting, that's all.

27:02.820 --> 27:05.141
Now, go get the rest
of your stuff.
No.

27:05.190 --> 27:07.340
You trusted Dad.

27:07.390 --> 27:09.017
Now you think I'm going
to be the same.

27:09.060 --> 27:12.029
Zach, I love you.

27:12.060 --> 27:14.153
I love you so much.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.191
But the computer stays here.

27:19.870 --> 27:21.167
(door slamming)

27:23.200 --> 27:26.203
(Islamic call to prayer
playing over stereo)

27:32.350 --> 27:34.215
How long

27:34.250 --> 27:36.138
did you stay at the cocktail
party, Mr. Tolliver?

27:36.180 --> 27:38.148
About two hours.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.214
I left around 10:00 pm,

27:39.250 --> 27:40.410
just after Mr. Stern left.

27:40.450 --> 27:43.180
MATAN:
And can you tell us what
you witnessed in that time?

27:43.220 --> 27:47.281
Well, I saw Mr. Stern consume
at least six drinks.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.854
MATAN:
Six?

27:48.900 --> 27:50.868
What kind of drinks?

27:50.900 --> 27:52.697
Are we talking
white wine spritzers here?

27:52.730 --> 27:54.197
Scotch. Neat.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.690
_ Tolliver is an
investment banker,

27:56.740 --> 27:58.708
works for Tolin & Howard.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.708
Have you ever had any fights
with Tolin & Howard?

28:00.740 --> 28:02.469
Mm-mm.

28:02.510 --> 28:03.772
The problem is,

28:03.810 --> 28:05.778
one time or another,

28:05.810 --> 28:07.448
I've pissed off
practically everyone.

28:10.850 --> 28:11.782
Tolliver.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.789
Tolliver Industries.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.287
It's a family run business.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.925
I sued them for civil rights
violations. Brenda!

28:18.960 --> 28:21.394
Get me the file on
Tolliver Industries.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.352
BRENDA:
Got it.

28:24.330 --> 28:26.093
Tibetan ginseng.

28:26.130 --> 28:27.119
Energy.

28:27.170 --> 28:28.933
Jonas,

28:28.970 --> 28:30.130
I checked on your case work.

28:30.170 --> 28:31.808
The files
weren't there.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.205
What do you mean they
weren't there? Why?

28:33.240 --> 28:35.208
A Cary Agos signed them out,

28:35.240 --> 28:37.003
on Will Gardner's authorization.

28:43.380 --> 28:44.881
What the hell are you doing?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.911
Sneaking around
my files?

28:46.950 --> 28:48.212
Looking for
little slipups?

28:48.260 --> 28:49.887
It's an issue of firm liability,
Jonas.

28:49.920 --> 28:52.525
Somebody has to stay on top
of these things.

28:52.560 --> 28:54.289
Oh, come on, Will.

28:54.330 --> 28:55.456
What?

28:55.500 --> 28:57.024
You certainly don't seem
inclined to do it.

28:57.060 --> 28:59.528
You know, you talk a good game
about liability,

28:59.570 --> 29:01.128
but we both know
this is about control.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.866
Jonas votes with me
90% of the time.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.104
You push him out...
Enough!

29:05.140 --> 29:06.960
My God.

29:07.010 --> 29:09.433
You call yourselves lawyers?

29:09.480 --> 29:10.947
I was winning cases

29:10.980 --> 29:13.915
when you were
in Little League.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.019
And you, my protg.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.915
The only reason
I hired you

29:16.950 --> 29:19.418
is because it looked good
to have a woman in the office.

29:19.450 --> 29:22.487
The both of you treat
the practice of law

29:22.520 --> 29:24.488
like it's used cars!

29:24.530 --> 29:26.919
Well, you try to
get rid of me,

29:26.960 --> 29:30.088
it'll cost you every cent
of your golden parachute,

29:30.130 --> 29:31.495
and that is after
the lawsuit!

29:31.530 --> 29:33.293
I will bankrupt this firm

29:33.330 --> 29:35.560
before I let you

29:35.600 --> 29:38.262
push me out.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.912
I suppose you heard
that tirade back there.

29:51.950 --> 29:55.989
I imagine the people on
Lakeshore Drive heard it, too.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.351
We'd better go in.

29:59.390 --> 30:02.359
Did you find anything
on Tolliver?

30:04.400 --> 30:07.028
Yeah... Yes,
Tolliver Industries.

30:09.070 --> 30:12.039
Right.

30:12.070 --> 30:13.298
Tolliver Industries.

30:13.340 --> 30:14.898
I sued them once.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.874
Civil rights violations.

30:16.910 --> 30:18.172
We should use that.

30:27.190 --> 30:29.181
(door opening)

30:31.590 --> 30:33.558
Miss Madison,
I'm Daniel Golden.

30:33.590 --> 30:35.353
We, uh, spoke on the phone.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.356
You look good, Peter.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.197
I always liked you in a suit.

30:39.230 --> 30:41.039
GOLDEN:
We have issues

30:41.070 --> 30:43.061
that we have
to deal with--

30:43.100 --> 30:45.068
this book
and your appearances.

30:45.110 --> 30:49.433
Yes, still a lot of pillow talk
to talk about.

30:50.480 --> 30:51.902
You phoned my wife.

30:51.950 --> 30:55.511
That's always what
it comes down to.

30:55.550 --> 30:57.541
Men and their wives.

30:57.580 --> 30:59.480
I'd like

30:59.520 --> 31:01.249
to talk to Peter alone.
No.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.383
You have an offer?

31:03.420 --> 31:04.557
Stop writing the book,

31:04.590 --> 31:05.579
stop doing interviews,

31:05.630 --> 31:07.552
spreading stories
about my client.

31:07.590 --> 31:08.591
How much?

31:13.030 --> 31:14.964
You recognize
this man?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.558
Prior to your...
(clears throat)

31:16.600 --> 31:18.238
relationship
with my client,

31:18.270 --> 31:20.158
you had a similar
relationship with him.

31:20.210 --> 31:21.006
Peter?

31:21.040 --> 31:24.271
The FBI believe
that he's responsible

31:24.310 --> 31:26.005
for ordering
the 24th Ward murders

31:26.050 --> 31:28.018
and three other
slayings.

31:28.050 --> 31:30.348
He owns a car dealership.

31:30.380 --> 31:31.984
He's a businessman.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.009
And I don't think

31:33.050 --> 31:35.189
he will look kindly
on your book

31:35.220 --> 31:36.289
touching on his business.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.527
My book doesn't touch
on his business.

31:38.560 --> 31:39.629
Unfortunately,
he doesn't know that.

31:39.660 --> 31:42.094
He also_doesn't know_
about certain personal things

31:42.130 --> 31:45.122
that you mentioned to my client
about him.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.990
That was between us.

31:47.030 --> 31:49.464
And it'll stay between you.

31:53.410 --> 31:55.037
Peter...

31:55.080 --> 31:57.139
you wouldn't.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.171
You phone my wife.

32:00.010 --> 32:02.444
You threaten
my family.

32:03.480 --> 32:06.040
You go on a talk show,

32:06.090 --> 32:08.058
humiliate,

32:08.090 --> 32:11.355
and slander my wife
and children.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.199
To protect my family,

32:15.230 --> 32:17.596
you have no idea
what I'm capable of.

32:34.550 --> 32:35.676
(door opens)

32:35.720 --> 32:37.119
(door closes)

32:44.230 --> 32:45.424
(knocking)

32:45.460 --> 32:46.620
Yeah?

32:46.660 --> 32:49.254
I need more help.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.097
It's what I live for.

33:00.140 --> 33:02.131
(camera shutter clicks)

33:05.180 --> 33:06.704
Donepezil.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.139
That's the name of the
medicine you're taking.

33:09.180 --> 33:10.716
That's why you crashed.

33:10.750 --> 33:14.413
You didn't drink at the party,
and the roads weren't wet.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.088
What are you talking about?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.326
I saw them, Mr. Stern.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.486
They're not energy pills.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.226
Peter's father
had dementia,

33:22.260 --> 33:23.693
not Alzheimer's.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.664
His was vascular.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.520
I know what
it looks like.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.664
The forgetfulness,
the anger,

33:30.700 --> 33:32.406
mood swings.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.203
I know how terrible...

33:34.240 --> 33:36.208
You know nothing.

33:36.240 --> 33:37.776
Jonas Stern does not
have dementia.

33:39.650 --> 33:43.074
Mr. Stern, you're
facing jail time.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.280
I know that.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.289
Your condition is your defense.

33:47.320 --> 33:48.685
This isn't a DUI.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.608
There is no condition!

33:50.660 --> 33:53.185
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna have people think

33:53.230 --> 33:55.255
that Jonas Stern
is losing his mind!

34:12.280 --> 34:16.842
There are three people
who know what you know.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.714
One is my doctor,
the second one is me,

34:20.750 --> 34:23.685
and the third is now covered
by attorney-client prIVIlege.

34:23.720 --> 34:26.689
And as your client,
I am ordering you

34:26.730 --> 34:30.291
not to breathe a word of this.

34:30.330 --> 34:32.195
Not in my defense,
not to anyone.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.367
Do you understand?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.832
Do you understand?

34:42.910 --> 34:45.105
I understand.

35:03.630 --> 35:05.598
Stern gets into an accident,
not because he's drunk,

35:05.630 --> 35:06.892
but because he's confused.

35:06.930 --> 35:10.138
He doesn't want to admit it, so
he goes and has four drinks--

35:10.170 --> 35:12.900
trying to make it look like
he's covering up a DUI.

35:12.940 --> 35:14.532
So what does
the cop do?

35:14.580 --> 35:15.774
Sobriety tests.

35:15.810 --> 35:18.347
Which he fails,
because now he's had a few,

35:18.380 --> 35:20.245
or he's shaken up.

35:20.280 --> 35:21.440
Or...

35:21.480 --> 35:22.845
What?

35:22.880 --> 35:25.280
The question isn't
what did the cop do.

35:25.320 --> 35:27.311
It's what didn't the cop do.

35:30.220 --> 35:32.188
Alicia...
where's Stern?

35:32.230 --> 35:33.822
He's meeting me
at court. Why?

35:33.860 --> 35:35.350
We went through
his casework.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.220
Everything was great
until a year ago,

35:37.260 --> 35:38.727
and he started missing
filing deadlines.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.260
Luckily, they
weren't important,

35:40.300 --> 35:42.165
but we could be
vulnerable here.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.328
I'm not asking you to divulge
any privileged communique.

35:45.370 --> 35:46.769
Good.

35:46.810 --> 35:48.573
But I need to know
where his head's at.

35:48.610 --> 35:51.602
Unless that blowup was his
final word on the subject.

35:53.350 --> 35:56.513
Look, all I want is for you to
look after his best interests.

35:56.550 --> 36:00.509
The firm's
best interests.

36:00.550 --> 36:02.689
The firm assigned me
to represent him, Will.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.723
With all the confidentiality
that entails,

36:05.760 --> 36:08.422
I can't... say anymore.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.566
(door slamming)

36:22.340 --> 36:24.399
You gave 'em to Mom.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.304
What? Get out of here!

36:26.350 --> 36:28.818
The pictures of Dad--
you gave 'em to Mom.

36:28.850 --> 36:30.317
I didn't give
anything to Mom.

36:30.350 --> 36:32.318
Well, they're gone.

36:32.350 --> 36:34.318
Grandma.

36:34.360 --> 36:36.385
Why...?

36:36.420 --> 36:37.978
How do you know that?

36:38.020 --> 36:40.329
Zach, she goes through my
room when I'm at school.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.248
She throws away stuff
she doesn't like, like

36:42.300 --> 36:43.494
candy and clothes.
She doesn't ever do it to you

36:44.700 --> 36:46.793
I hate this.

36:46.830 --> 36:49.196
Yeah. When did you start
paying attention?

36:50.800 --> 36:55.271
ALICIA:
Officer, what sobriety tests
did you perform on Mr. Stern?

36:55.310 --> 36:57.608
Objection. Officer Sutton
has already testified in detail

36:57.640 --> 36:58.971
about the tests he performed.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.079
Yes, Your Honor,

37:00.110 --> 37:03.671
but I'm more interested
in the one he didn't perform.

37:03.720 --> 37:05.312
Okay. Let's see
where this is going.

37:05.350 --> 37:06.612
I see no record

37:06.650 --> 37:09.585
of you performing a preliminary
breathalyzer test on Mr. Stern

37:09.620 --> 37:10.757
at the scene, Officer.

37:10.790 --> 37:12.257
I don't always do that, ma'am.

37:19.530 --> 37:22.988
These are reports
from your last

37:23.040 --> 37:24.598
37 DUIs.

37:24.640 --> 37:28.508
You performed preliminary
breathalyzers on...

37:29.410 --> 37:30.604
Would you like to guess

37:30.640 --> 37:31.402
how many?

37:33.450 --> 37:35.611
Thirty-seven.

37:37.420 --> 37:39.342
JUDGE ROMANO :
Officer Sutton.

37:39.390 --> 37:41.449
Your Honor,
it's perfectly innocent.

37:41.490 --> 37:42.787
I voided the
test results

37:42.820 --> 37:44.321
because the machine
was malfunctioning.

37:44.360 --> 37:47.352
It showed Mr. Stern's
blood alcohol level was .03,

37:47.390 --> 37:49.858
but I could see he was drunk,
he was stumbling around...

37:49.900 --> 37:52.289
So you neglected to put
it in the police report?

37:52.330 --> 37:54.469
It wasn't accurate.

37:54.500 --> 37:56.968
We got back to the station--
he blew a .15.

37:57.000 --> 37:58.968
An hour later,

37:59.010 --> 38:00.705
after the drinks
from the bar

38:00.740 --> 38:02.537
fully
kicked in...
Your Honor?

38:02.580 --> 38:05.344
Mr. Brody, I'm
dismissing the DUI.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.405
And unless you want me
to dismiss the battery

38:07.450 --> 38:08.348
and levy sanctions,

38:08.380 --> 38:10.712
you'd better come up
with something fast.

38:13.950 --> 38:15.884
Misdemeanor assault.

38:15.920 --> 38:17.717
Six months probation.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.057
Ask her.

38:19.090 --> 38:22.491
Misdemeanor assault?
Six months probation?

38:22.530 --> 38:24.498
Time served?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.730
You must be pretty pleased
with yourself.

38:31.770 --> 38:35.035
You shouldn't be
driving, Mr. Stern.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.571
And unless you disclose
your condition,

38:37.610 --> 38:39.874
you shouldn't be
practicing law, either.

38:44.150 --> 38:45.515
What are you...

38:45.550 --> 38:47.438
Th-The partners meeting
isn't until 5:00

38:47.490 --> 38:48.616
Call it off.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.013
I'm not fighting
you, Diane.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.459
I'm leaving.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.726
Last thing I need is to
waste time and energy here

38:56.760 --> 38:58.762
fighting with people I love.

39:00.470 --> 39:02.631
And I do.

39:02.670 --> 39:05.002
That thing I said earlier--

39:05.040 --> 39:07.008
I'm sorry.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.735
It wasn't true.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.532
I know.

39:10.580 --> 39:13.140
I was the best lawyer
you had at that firm.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.011
Yeah.

39:15.050 --> 39:18.076
I have to admit,
I never thought I'd see the day

39:18.120 --> 39:20.588
Jonas Stern retired.

39:20.620 --> 39:23.111
Who said anything
about retiring?

39:23.160 --> 39:25.856
I'm leaving to
start a new firm.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.027
What?

39:27.060 --> 39:30.029
You know, last year, you billed

39:30.060 --> 39:32.597
over $50 million between
Gentech Financials

39:32.630 --> 39:34.598
and Parthenon
Systems alone.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.596
Now, they're my clients,

39:36.640 --> 39:37.993
and I'm taking them with me.

39:38.040 --> 39:39.928
Jonas, you take our clients,

39:39.970 --> 39:41.835
you forfeit
your golden parachute.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.871
And that's not all.

39:45.910 --> 39:48.470
I'm gonna take a third
of your business.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.841
And then...

39:50.880 --> 39:52.939
I'm coming back for the rest.

39:52.990 --> 39:54.810
But, hey,

39:54.860 --> 39:58.011
it'll be fun.

39:58.060 --> 40:00.187
We're not

40:00.230 --> 40:01.993
communicating here, Jim.

40:02.030 --> 40:03.588
I want it bigger.

40:03.630 --> 40:06.519
I need 25,000 square feet
at least.

40:06.570 --> 40:07.867
All right. Hey.

40:07.900 --> 40:09.197
What are you doing?

40:09.240 --> 40:12.539
Well, getting an office, staff,
starting up.

40:12.570 --> 40:15.209
We talked about this.

40:15.240 --> 40:17.128
No, y talked about this.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.501
And I'm the only one

40:19.550 --> 40:21.916
to whom you will ever
talk about this.

40:21.950 --> 40:24.214
Mr. Stern, you have
an ethical duty.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.912
Yes, to zealously
represent my clients.

40:26.950 --> 40:28.019
Which I will do,

40:28.050 --> 40:31.554
with a team of young and hungry
lawyers to back me up.

40:31.590 --> 40:34.889
And I want you
to be one of them.

40:37.200 --> 40:40.226
Oh, I... I can't. I...

40:40.270 --> 40:42.761
Thank you, but
H... I can't.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.462
Hmm.

40:45.510 --> 40:47.705
Loyalty to your friend
Will, hmm?

40:47.740 --> 40:50.038
Well, I admire that.

40:50.080 --> 40:52.207
Just know that he will stab you

40:52.250 --> 40:53.979
in the back
if it benefits him.

40:54.010 --> 40:55.216
(phone ringing)

40:55.250 --> 40:57.047
I'll get that, Brenda!

40:57.080 --> 40:59.139
Hello.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.589
Yeah, yeah, Jim.

41:00.620 --> 41:03.509
Yeah, hold on.
Just hold on ﬁve seconds.

41:03.560 --> 41:05.858
Your husband was set up.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.027
What?!

41:07.060 --> 41:08.698
Forget the sex.

41:08.730 --> 41:11.153
Sex was just the Barker's tease.

41:11.200 --> 41:14.988
There are a lot of people
who made a bad bet,

41:15.040 --> 41:17.793
and now they're covering
their ass.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.229
I-I don't... I don't under...

41:20.270 --> 41:21.532
What does that mean?

41:21.580 --> 41:23.639
Jim, yeah,
I need it in the loop.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.944
In the loop, yeah.
Mr. Stern...

41:25.980 --> 41:27.538
That's it, Alicia.

41:27.580 --> 41:30.617
I'm not your Deep Throat
on this.

41:30.650 --> 41:32.584
Your husband was set up,

41:32.620 --> 41:35.282
and they're not going
to let him out of prison ever.

41:35.320 --> 41:37.584
Yeah.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.689
No, you're thinking small. Yeah.

41:38.730 --> 41:39.958
Find another well,

41:39.990 --> 41:41.958
will you?

41:42.000 --> 41:43.695
Yeah.

41:43.730 --> 41:45.027
No.

41:45.070 --> 41:47.163
No, no, no, no,
that won't do.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.901
(keyless entry remote chirps)

42:04.590 --> 42:06.581
Don't worry. I just...

42:06.620 --> 42:08.781
I wanted to tell you
that I'm sorry?

42:08.820 --> 42:11.584
I thought that your husband
was in love with me.

42:11.630 --> 42:13.120
He made me think

42:13.160 --> 42:15.754
that he was in love with
me, and now I just...

42:15.800 --> 42:17.097
Look, I wanted
to warn you, okay?

42:17.130 --> 42:19.291
Peter threatened me. He said

42:19.330 --> 42:21.161
that ifI didn't
pull the book,

42:21.200 --> 42:22.838
and I didn't stop
giving interviews,

42:22.870 --> 42:24.929
that he would hurt me.

42:24.970 --> 42:26.699
Look, would
you listen?

42:26.740 --> 42:28.628
I don't know what
he's capable of.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.602
He doesn't even
know that I'm here.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.972
(engine starting)
I don't know what
he would do...

42:33.010 --> 42:34.238
Oh, go to hell!

42:34.280 --> 42:35.679
(bangs car)
Go to hell!

42:35.720 --> 42:37.711
You two deserve
each other!

42:37.750 --> 42:39.217
You tell him

42:39.250 --> 42:41.115
if he does anything,
I'll print it.

42:41.150 --> 42:44.688
I'll give an interview
you wouldn't believe!

42:50.830 --> 42:53.367
(knocking, door opens)

42:53.400 --> 42:55.595
Time to go?

42:58.870 --> 43:00.337
Hey.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.678
What's wrong?

43:03.710 --> 43:06.144
Is everything
all right?

43:06.180 --> 43:07.306
Kids okay?

43:27.700 --> 43:28.837
(door opens)
