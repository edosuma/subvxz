00:00.967 --> 00:02.958
Don't you think someone's
trying to destroy your movie?

00:03.069 --> 00:04.866
Such as
the Phantom of Stage 28?

00:05.071 --> 00:06.060
Action!

00:08.842 --> 00:10.139
The Phantom of Stage 28?

00:10.210 --> 00:12.337
Let's just call him a guy
in a monk suit, okay?

00:12.412 --> 00:14.573
Now, I saw that guy,
Mr. Knight, and he was real.

00:14.647 --> 00:17.241
Michael, I've detected some
movement directly behind you.

00:20.253 --> 00:21.242
He's all yours.

00:23.923 --> 00:25.948
You've had two cracks at him,
and you've blown them both.

00:26.292 --> 00:28.226
I'll make the next one count.

00:43.676 --> 00:46.076
Knight Rider,
a shadowy flight...

00:46.146 --> 00:48.774
into the dangerous world
of a man...

00:48.848 --> 00:50.440
who does not exist.

00:59.092 --> 01:01.117
Michael Knight,
a young loner...

01:01.194 --> 01:03.492
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.930 --> 01:05.864
the helpless,
the powerless...

01:06.066 --> 01:08.864
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

02:36.556 --> 02:38.114
I'd sure like to get
this shot before lunch.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.419
I'm ready to make one.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.184
I just heard Travis is doing
the stunt himself?

02:42.862 --> 02:44.386
Karen, please,
it's all worked out.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.863
I just did a walkthrough
with Travis.

02:45.932 --> 02:48.332
I am ready to roll.
Relax. Okay?

02:48.701 --> 02:50.430
Look, after what I've been
through on this picture...

02:50.503 --> 02:52.971
I'm not going to relax until
the last shot is in the can.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.007
Well, we won't get this one
if you keep interfering.

02:55.141 --> 02:56.130
Gavin...

02:56.209 --> 02:59.076
you're producing a picture
that's $20 million over budget.

02:59.145 --> 03:01.841
If your star gets hurt, we're
not gonna make a penny of it back.

03:02.048 --> 03:03.538
Well, you never will
anyway.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.584
You know, whoever said, "Don't
throw good money after bad"...

03:05.652 --> 03:06.641
was talking about
this turkey.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.585
People, people...

03:08.655 --> 03:11.681
I turned down the beach
picture to do this "turkey."

03:11.758 --> 03:12.747
I could be on Maui...

03:12.825 --> 03:15.055
surrounded by squealing
beach bunnies in bikinis.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.357
So, let's make up
our minds, please.

03:17.797 --> 03:19.560
Come on, Tobey,
I can handle it.

03:19.899 --> 03:23.335
You know, if we shut down, we'll be
another $80,000 in the hole, Karen.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.564
Cliff, you feel confident
about this?

03:25.838 --> 03:27.032
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.507
You're head of production.
You decide.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.107
We have little choice.

03:35.815 --> 03:36.804
Let's do it.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.174
Works for me.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.545
Okay, listen up,
we're gonna make one.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.788
All right, take your places.

03:50.196 --> 03:51.788
Effects, are you ready?

03:58.338 --> 04:00.397
All right, everybody
listen up, please.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.236
This is a very important shot.

04:02.709 --> 04:03.767
Travis, are you ready?

04:04.844 --> 04:07.142
With lots of energy
and keep it pumping.

04:07.380 --> 04:09.143
And action!

04:36.909 --> 04:38.740
All right, you wanna tell me
what happened back there, Tobey?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.170
What are you asking
me for?

04:40.246 --> 04:41.907
Clifford's in charge
of special effects.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.608
I set four charges,
Mr. Gavin.

04:43.716 --> 04:44.808
Five went off.

04:44.884 --> 04:46.374
I don't know where the
fifth one came from...

04:46.452 --> 04:47.441
but it wasn't mine.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.283
Well, whose was it?
I mean, does anybody else...

04:49.355 --> 04:50.583
have access
to that equipment?

04:50.657 --> 04:52.454
Oh, no,
I'm the only one.

04:53.326 --> 04:54.315
Now, wait a minute.

04:54.394 --> 04:56.157
There was a guy
out by the truck before.

04:56.596 --> 04:57.688
What guy, who?

04:58.264 --> 05:00.061
I don't know. He had
on a hood and a mask.

05:00.166 --> 05:03.567
Oh, come on, you're not gonna start
that Phantom of Stage 28 nonsense.

05:03.870 --> 05:06.395
Yeah, they stopped blaming
accidents on him 20 years ago.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.373
Well, someone is to blame,
and it's time to find out who.

05:23.556 --> 05:26.821
This is the fourth accident in
three weeks and the most serious.

05:27.894 --> 05:29.828
You've heard of
Raging Sky?

05:29.962 --> 05:30.986
Who hasn't?

05:31.230 --> 05:33.130
Battles on the set,
battles off the set.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.560
They've got a runaway
budget of what?

05:35.802 --> 05:38.168
$25 million,
and no end in sight.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.068
Man, what I could do
with that.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.969
What a small country could
do with that.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.006
But you know movie people.

05:44.243 --> 05:45.232
"It's only money."

05:45.311 --> 05:46.778
Not McKee Studios,
Bonnie.

05:47.213 --> 05:51.206
For years, they've donated time and
money to our educational film program.

05:51.584 --> 05:53.245
Why, when Jack McKee
was alive...

05:53.419 --> 05:55.546
he was an ardent supporter
of the Foundation.

05:55.788 --> 05:58.621
No, they have too much integrity
to be this irresponsible.

05:59.158 --> 06:03.151
So we're talking serious
bad luck or sabotage.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.625
Well, whichever it is...

06:05.231 --> 06:06.994
they've asked for our help
and they deserve it.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.225
Your contact
is Karen Bennett...

06:09.335 --> 06:10.996
Vice President in charge
of production.

06:11.304 --> 06:14.273
Devon, I think you've
left something out.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.074
It's rather silly,
really...

06:18.144 --> 06:20.237
but there has been
some talk at the studio...

06:20.313 --> 06:21.803
that the legendary Phantom...

06:22.248 --> 06:24.216
may have something
to do with it all.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.277
Bonnie, you don't really think
there's a phantom.

06:27.920 --> 06:28.909
Do you?

06:31.457 --> 06:32.446
No.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.086
You want me to investigate
a phantom?

06:38.564 --> 06:39.553
Certainly.

06:40.299 --> 06:41.288
Why not?

06:43.503 --> 06:44.492
Why not?

07:04.056 --> 07:05.546
As you were saying, Michael.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.617
Don't rub it in, pal. I don't see
a phantom in the bunch. Do you?

07:08.694 --> 07:12.130
No, but around here, no one would
think twice about it if they did.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.325
I agree. He'd simply get lost
in the crowd.

08:01.614 --> 08:05.050
You look just like
Ms. Bennett's 10:15.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.516
Let's see, Michael Knight?

08:06.586 --> 08:08.281
Foundation for Law
and Government?

08:08.354 --> 08:10.151
You got it.
She's expecting me.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.783
Very quick, Mr. Knight.
We're all expecting you.

08:13.426 --> 08:16.224
I'm Edward Kent, Ms. Bennett's
executive secretary.

08:16.596 --> 08:18.086
I encode 90 words a minute.

08:18.164 --> 08:21.099
I take shorthand at 120. I do
not, however, make coffee...

08:21.567 --> 08:23.694
nor have I ever been chased
around a desk.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.002
I'm afraid
you'll have to wait.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.905
The negotiations are at
a delicate stage.

08:29.108 --> 08:31.542
Well, when you two decide
what to shoot, I'll shoot it!

08:32.211 --> 08:33.235
I could be on Maui.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.803
On Maui, surrounded by
beach bunnies in bikinis.

08:39.352 --> 08:43.880
Excusez-moi. If I don't get this
distributed, McKee is in deep kimchi.

08:43.956 --> 08:44.945
Ciao.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.958
The insurance company
is wrong!

08:47.026 --> 08:48.516
Now, look, I'm the producer
and I'm telling you...

08:48.594 --> 08:50.425
there's no way I can finish
this picture without Travis!

08:50.563 --> 08:51.860
And I am head
of this studio.

08:51.931 --> 08:54.661
It is my job that's on the
line and I think you can.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.801
You're not the one who has
to figure out how to do it!

08:56.903 --> 08:58.894
But I already have.
All we have to do...

09:00.239 --> 09:02.707
Yeah, they're casting the beach
picture down the hall, 316.

09:03.109 --> 09:04.474
My name is Michael Knight.

09:05.411 --> 09:07.971
Oh, oh, oh,
from the Foundation.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.113
Boy, am I glad
to see you.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.581
You and I need to talk.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.706
Would you just hold it?

09:12.785 --> 09:15.276
Look, I've got $20 million of
my own money in this picture.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.753
We finish
our talk first.

09:16.856 --> 09:20.485
That's fine by me, but your people
are the ones who are getting hurt...

09:20.726 --> 09:22.956
and I'm here to try and find
out who or what's behind this.

09:23.029 --> 09:24.018
Behind what?

09:24.096 --> 09:26.758
Well, for openers, don't you think
someone's trying to destroy your movie?

09:27.033 --> 09:29.433
I mean, you've had four
accidents in the last five weeks.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.094
That's a pretty
suspicious pattern.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.770
A pattern that leads right to
the Special Effects Department.

09:33.839 --> 09:36.899
Yeah, well, that's the one thing
that Karen and I do agree on.

09:37.176 --> 09:38.438
You talk to Sam Clifford.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.210
Of course, he'll probably
blame it on this legend...

09:41.280 --> 09:42.804
that he's dredged up
to cover his butt.

09:42.915 --> 09:46.146
The legend of the so-called
"Phantom" that haunts the studio.

09:46.819 --> 09:47.808
The one and the same.

09:47.987 --> 09:50.148
Yeah, the Phantom
of Stage 28.

09:50.222 --> 09:52.554
It started with the original
Raging Sky. It was a nightmare.

09:52.658 --> 09:54.148
One accident after another.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.361
Do you think there could
be a connection? Oh, no.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.396
No, no way. No, the person
behind them was Dennis Darrow.

09:59.465 --> 10:02.400
He was an actor who was originally turned
down for the starring role in the film.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.333
He vowed it would never
get made.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.228
I mean, the man's been dead
for years.

10:06.305 --> 10:07.795
Of course, his body's
never been found.

10:07.873 --> 10:12.333
Who knows, maybe his corpse sprouted a
cape and he went wherever phantoms go.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.807
The bottom line is,
he still could be alive.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.543
Really, Mr. Knight.

10:16.716 --> 10:19.276
His car went off a cliff and
exploded. There was nothing left...

10:19.352 --> 10:20.341
but ashes and smoke.

10:21.253 --> 10:22.515
And a lot of
unfinished business.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.591
Michael, I detect someone
bearing down on you.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.542
KITT, he's all yours.

10:57.590 --> 10:58.579
KITT, scan his vitals.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.689
Michael, it has no vitals.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.185
What have we here?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.831
A 1200 cc, four-cylinder
direct-drive motorcycle...

11:08.901 --> 11:11.768
and state-of-the-art robot,
hard-wired to the frame.

11:12.938 --> 11:14.997
Then it's gotta be
remote-controlled from somewhere.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.099
It still is.
I'm picking up a signal.

11:17.476 --> 11:18.841
Trace it back
to its source.

11:18.911 --> 11:19.969
I'm locked on.

11:20.046 --> 11:21.638
Michael, I'm also
picking up...

11:22.114 --> 11:24.014
Get away from that thing! Now!

11:31.023 --> 11:32.012
Thanks, pal.

11:32.591 --> 11:34.491
Nice little
fail-safe mode, huh?

11:34.794 --> 11:35.783
Yes, Michael.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.919
Guaranteed a murder
without a suspect.

11:55.314 --> 11:56.303
Hi.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.916
Can you tell me where I
could find Sam Clifford?

12:03.389 --> 12:04.583
Cameras reloading.

12:19.472 --> 12:22.032
From the sound of that,
you must be Sam Clifford.

12:22.374 --> 12:23.363
Yeah.

12:23.442 --> 12:25.740
Hey, you'd better stand back
here. These are very unstable.

12:26.145 --> 12:29.410
I've got to set them off before I pick
up my pink slip and check out of here.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.540
You know, for a guy who was
just fired for negligence,

12:31.617 --> 12:33.551
you seem pretty
safety-conscious to me.

12:34.553 --> 12:36.521
Well, you tell that
to the insurance company.

12:36.689 --> 12:39.658
Twenty pictures without an accident.
Didn't mean a thing to them.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.791
Are you the guy that's
investigating these accidents?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.762
Yeah, yeah, my name
is Michael Knight.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.919
And from what I hear...

12:45.998 --> 12:48.330
you claim you got more
explosions than you bargained for.

12:48.534 --> 12:49.523
Claim?

12:50.636 --> 12:53.332
Four buttons.
Five explosions.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.770
Now, how's
the fifth one mine?

12:55.541 --> 12:59.102
KITT, scan the circuits in this
unit for any sign of tampering.

12:59.178 --> 13:00.167
Right away, Michael.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.840
What's that all about? That's a
little special effect of my own.

13:03.082 --> 13:05.175
The fourth circuit
has been rewired, Michael.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.583
It transmits two signals,
one delayed...

13:07.653 --> 13:09.416
when the detonator button
is depressed.

13:10.790 --> 13:11.779
Yeah.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.423
Yeah, that guy by the truck.
Now, it had to be him.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.017
Nobody was near
my equipment until...

13:16.095 --> 13:18.495
You're talking about a guy
in a monk's robe.

13:18.931 --> 13:20.694
Yeah, the Phantom
of Stage 28.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.394
I saw that guy, Mr. Knight,
and he was real.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.494
Look, let's not call him
the Phantom of Stage 28.

13:25.571 --> 13:27.835
Let's just call him a man
in a monk's robe, okay?

13:28.040 --> 13:29.029
You call him what you want.

13:29.341 --> 13:32.833
But the bottom line is, the
original Raging Sky was shot on 28.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.276
Now, people that have seen him
say that's where he hangs out.

13:35.414 --> 13:36.472
Well, whoever he is...

13:36.549 --> 13:39.609
Karen Bennett says he's gonna have
another crack at making some trouble today.

13:40.319 --> 13:41.308
That's right.

13:41.754 --> 13:45.417
They're shooting a big sequence with Liz
Preston over on Stage 1 right after lunch.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.255
Gives me a couple of hours.
Where's Stage 28?

13:48.360 --> 13:49.827
It's on the other side
of the lot.

13:49.962 --> 13:51.930
But they haven't shot anything
over there in years.

13:52.965 --> 13:55.559
I know, I know. Everybody
thinks the legend is a big joke.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.961
But this is a very superstitious
business, Mr. Knight.

13:58.037 --> 14:00.005
Superstition or not,
it's all I got.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.572
Thank you very much.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.016
Michael, Devon's calling.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.557
Hello, Michael, how are things
in Hollywood this morning?

14:25.798 --> 14:28.358
A little rocky.
Hitchcock would have loved it.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.129
We've got a saboteur
on our hands.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.203
Well, I'm glad
you didn't say "psycho."

14:32.605 --> 14:33.594
Might be that, too.

14:34.473 --> 14:36.873
Devon, right now I need
everything Bonnie can find...

14:36.942 --> 14:38.842
on an actor
named Dennis Darrow.

14:39.044 --> 14:42.070
Also, run down the insurance
policies on Raging Sky.

14:42.514 --> 14:44.505
I wanna know who benefits
if it shuts down.

14:44.583 --> 14:45.572
Right away, Michael.

14:45.651 --> 14:46.777
Oh, and be careful.

14:46.852 --> 14:49.878
I don't want two phantoms
haunting McKee Studios.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.012
Over and out.

16:00.726 --> 16:02.125
Michael, have you
found anything?

16:03.329 --> 16:05.695
Yeah, KITT,
this place is incredible.

16:06.365 --> 16:09.857
There's enough stuff in here
to make Conan III, IV and V.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.537
Enough bad guys, too.

16:55.414 --> 16:56.813
KITT, monitor all exits!

16:56.882 --> 16:58.144
I'm scanning them now.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.144
Which one? Where is he?

17:02.221 --> 17:05.849
I don't know. I'm absolutely
positive no one has come out.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.290
And no one is in the building,
except you.

17:17.301 --> 17:20.567
Devon, those were not rumors
about a phantom on Stage 28.

17:21.106 --> 17:22.367
Yes, I understand, Michael.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.074
And that's one of the reasons
you're on this investigation.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.532
By the way, Michael...

17:26.744 --> 17:29.714
Bonnie found very little data
on your Mr. Darrow.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.647
It seems he died
over 20 years ago.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.185
And nothing's turned up since?
I mean, she's positive?

17:34.253 --> 17:36.721
Not even his remains,
as I understand it.

17:36.789 --> 17:40.122
I have something more substantial
on your insurance inquiry.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.654
Gavin and the studio
are fully covered.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.692
That means they both get
their investments back...

17:44.763 --> 17:46.390
if the picture can't
be completed.

17:47.766 --> 17:48.755
It gives us nothing.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.598
Well, I've also discovered that
the studio has just taken out...

17:51.670 --> 17:55.800
an additional $4 million policy
on their star, Liz Preston.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.100
No kidding.
That's uncanny timing.

17:58.177 --> 18:00.372
She's doing
a major stunt today, Devon.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.705
I'm on my way
to the back lot now.

18:02.781 --> 18:03.770
Good luck, Michael.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.455
What's with the darkened
windows, pal?

18:16.662 --> 18:18.357
This is Hollywood, Michael.

18:18.530 --> 18:20.327
I'm wearing my sunglasses.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.296
Effects, are you ready?

18:29.608 --> 18:31.007
Hey, you guys actors?

18:31.310 --> 18:33.744
Heck no, stuntmen.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.268
Oh...

18:36.348 --> 18:37.645
I'm looking for Liz Preston.

18:37.783 --> 18:40.115
You and about
100 other cowboys.

18:40.552 --> 18:42.884
Better start twirling
your lariat, son...

18:43.388 --> 18:44.616
here she comes.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.215
Excuse me.

18:49.761 --> 18:53.128
Don't tell me. Michael Knight, the
investigator I've heard so much about?

18:53.298 --> 18:55.459
I was wondering when you'd
get around to looking me up.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.095
Well, I'm sorry it took so long.
Can we talk for a few minutes?

18:59.171 --> 19:00.263
It's the cars.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.303
That's all that matters
nowadays.

19:02.608 --> 19:07.170
Yeah, all this picture needs
is one more jackrabbit-mobile.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.646
And what's wrong
with fast cars, may I ask?

19:09.815 --> 19:10.804
Everything.

19:11.116 --> 19:12.913
Raging Sky was a western.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.421
How do you remake a western
with cars playing horses?

19:16.488 --> 19:19.286
I've cleaned up a couple
of western towns in my day.

19:19.458 --> 19:20.948
Hogwash.

19:23.462 --> 19:27.023
Well, Michael, I'll tell ya, the last
man who said he liked all my movies...

19:27.466 --> 19:31.027
had a thing for desperate,
vulnerable women on the run.

19:31.103 --> 19:33.003
Five minutes, Liz.
Thanks.

19:33.105 --> 19:35.471
Bet you're beginning to feel like
one of your characters lately.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.735
Wardrobe to the set.

19:36.808 --> 19:40.835
Liz, tell me the truth.
You want out of this picture?

19:41.246 --> 19:43.874
No, I'm very grateful
to have this job.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.645
I think I'd be crazy not to
admit I'm a little bit frightened.

19:48.353 --> 19:49.445
Some people are.

19:52.758 --> 19:53.747
You don't know?

19:55.127 --> 19:59.427
Liz, the studio took out an extra
$4 million insurance policy on you.

20:00.465 --> 20:01.454
Really?

20:02.501 --> 20:04.162
I'm impressed.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.563
Well, I'm not.

20:06.405 --> 20:09.374
Now, I understand you're doing
a twist on a runaway buggy scene.

20:09.508 --> 20:10.873
You wanna run
that stunt by me?

20:11.076 --> 20:13.544
Yeah, sure. Let's see.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.939
I'm driving a pick-up truck
down a hill...

20:17.282 --> 20:18.874
and a tire blows out...

20:18.951 --> 20:21.112
so, I lose control
of the vehicle...

20:21.420 --> 20:25.686
then the truck crashes into a
bridge, the bridge almost collapses...

20:26.191 --> 20:29.251
and the truck screeches to a halt
just before I plunge into the water.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.650
That's all?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.959
Well, actually, the stunt
double does all the hard stuff.

20:33.031 --> 20:36.831
I just sit in that 4X4 truck
over there and scream a lot.

20:37.302 --> 20:40.066
Look, just so you know, I'm gonna run
through every aspect of the stunt...

20:40.138 --> 20:41.366
before you do the shot.

20:41.907 --> 20:42.896
Well, thank you.

20:43.141 --> 20:44.438
I appreciate the interest.

20:44.843 --> 20:45.832
I'm interested.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.067
Excuse me.

20:47.145 --> 20:48.271
I'm sick of people
getting hurt.

20:48.347 --> 20:49.814
Look, there aren't
gonna be any more accidents.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.611
We got rid of them when we got rid
of Clifford. You are using this...

20:53.318 --> 20:56.685
Mr. Knight, just the man I wanted to see.
Have you checked out Clifford's story?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.518
Yeah. I think he's telling
the truth.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.813
What?

21:00.359 --> 21:02.520
You mean it wasn't his incompetence
that was causing the accidents?

21:02.594 --> 21:04.357
We really have a maniac
on our hands?

21:04.997 --> 21:05.986
Looks that way.

21:06.064 --> 21:07.827
Well, that's it.
I'm pulling the plug.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.389
Hold it. Hold it. There's
no way I'm doing that shot.

21:10.369 --> 21:11.893
Have you had a chance
to check the set?

21:11.970 --> 21:14.404
I'm gonna check on it now.
Then I'm going to Stage 28...

21:14.473 --> 21:16.566
to see if I can pick up the
Phantom's trail. Excuse me.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.404
Look. Karen, I don't care
if God himself came down...

21:19.478 --> 21:20.604
and checked out that set.
There's no way...

21:20.679 --> 21:22.044
Okay, Liz? Ready?

21:22.648 --> 21:23.808
You got three minutes.

21:27.586 --> 21:30.180
Thanks second team.
Bring in the reelies.

21:30.255 --> 21:31.620
Thank you, second team.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.567
Michael, I'm detecting
unusual movement...

21:46.638 --> 21:48.765
and electrical activity
above Liz's makeup table.

21:50.742 --> 21:51.970
Liz. Liz!

21:55.013 --> 21:56.002
Liz!

22:12.464 --> 22:15.160
You all right?
I think I will be.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.158
Easy.

22:20.972 --> 22:22.997
Am I getting older, or is
this job getting tougher?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.542
Liz, thank God
you're okay.

22:24.609 --> 22:26.201
I'm sorry, I don't know how
this could have happened.

22:26.278 --> 22:29.111
From now on, I check out every location
before anyone is allowed on the set.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.706
I don't have time for you, Mr.
Knight, I have a budget and a deadline.

22:31.783 --> 22:33.080
All right, Karen,
that does it.

22:33.151 --> 22:35.585
I've tried it your way, I've
tried it his, now we'll do it mine.

22:35.787 --> 22:38.051
This production is over.
It's finished. It's a wrap.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.281
You can notify the insurance
company to pay off.

22:40.425 --> 22:42.086
Not again.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.220
Listen, may I remind you that
I have a pay-or-play contract?

22:45.464 --> 22:48.126
Make up your minds, or you'll
be delivering my checks to Maui.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.461
Aloha.

22:53.772 --> 22:54.966
I broke a nail.

23:04.716 --> 23:07.378
Karen, if this is the end
of the film, I'm sorry...

23:07.452 --> 23:10.148
but I promise you it is not
the end of the investigation.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.156
No, it's not the end
of the film.

23:12.624 --> 23:15.525
That's my decision, not Gavin's.
He was just letting off some steam.

23:16.361 --> 23:18.124
Have you ever thought about
going along with him?

23:18.263 --> 23:19.252
Of course.

23:19.664 --> 23:22.360
But if I shut this film down without
making up the cost over-runs...

23:22.434 --> 23:23.423
we're out of business.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.470
Why? The studio will collect
on the insurance.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.596
I mean, obviously, you're
gonna come out with something.

23:28.273 --> 23:30.571
Michael, I am not in this
business to collect insurance.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.269
I'm in this business
to make movies.

23:32.978 --> 23:35.970
Women in positions of power
are still considered a novelty.

23:36.047 --> 23:37.708
I have to finish
what I started.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.818
Karen, you know your stuff. You wouldn't
have made it up the ladder if you didn't.

23:41.386 --> 23:44.150
There are those who said
I wasn't always on my feet.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.450
You're saying that they think it's just
a matter of time before you mess up?

23:47.592 --> 23:50.356
They thought I had when
Travis landed in the hospital.

23:50.829 --> 23:52.387
But as I was saying
to Gavin...

23:52.464 --> 23:55.763
if we increased the explosives to
mask the use of a stunt double...

23:55.834 --> 23:57.995
we could shoot that last scene
and make it work.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.060
That stunt double
was going to be me.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.336
Michael, I appreciate that...

24:04.409 --> 24:07.401
but you'd be putting yourself in
an extremely dangerous situation.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.910
I knew that going in.

24:10.182 --> 24:13.345
Like someone once said, "I've
gotta finish what I started."

24:14.886 --> 24:15.875
Karen?

24:16.922 --> 24:18.219
Karen, I just heard.

24:18.356 --> 24:19.345
I stopped by the set I...

24:19.424 --> 24:21.688
Well, get back down there and
find out everything you can.

24:21.760 --> 24:23.421
I'm going to have a mob
of reporters in this office...

24:23.495 --> 24:24.689
and I need something
to tell them.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.932
Michael, thanks.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.192
Piece of cake.

24:32.337 --> 24:34.532
I do hope she isn't
expecting the truth.

24:37.409 --> 24:41.140
When a movie goes down the tube,
there are a thousand versions of why.

24:41.213 --> 24:44.205
Really? Well, I would be
interested in yours.

24:44.916 --> 24:49.080
You mean, who might be
sabotaging this film?

24:49.821 --> 24:52.915
Well, no more than half
the producers in Hollywood.

24:54.526 --> 24:56.255
This is Tinseltown,
Mr. Knight.

24:57.062 --> 25:00.054
The place where
massive egos collide.

25:00.465 --> 25:03.025
Where people get a kick out
of watching their friends fail.

25:03.568 --> 25:07.129
Where 10,000 mourners go
to a producer's funeral...

25:07.205 --> 25:09.537
just to make sure the jerk
is really dead.

25:09.975 --> 25:14.344
Take it from me, Mr. Knight, you
have waded into a pool of sharks.

25:14.646 --> 25:16.170
Could I tell you stories.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.580
Yeah, but you didn't tell me
the story I need.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.282
Well, I'm sorry, I...

25:22.554 --> 25:24.351
I did my best to tell you
how the game was played.

25:24.689 --> 25:27.590
Whoever tried to kill Liz
Preston isn't playing a game.

25:30.662 --> 25:31.651
Neither am I.

25:41.139 --> 25:43.437
Just how long have you
been at this, anyway?

25:43.708 --> 25:45.733
About 30 years.

25:46.177 --> 25:49.772
Ever since we made
the original Raging Sky.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.508
I'd hold that one
if I were you.

25:51.616 --> 25:53.948
You sure?
I'll play these.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.686
You wouldn't happen to know
what Buck is holding.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.847
You have to take some chances, Slim.
After all, this is a game of risk.

26:02.193 --> 26:04.286
But I wouldn't hedge my bet
if I were you.

26:18.643 --> 26:20.611
I see you got tired
of wearing your shades, pal.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.407
No, I only wear them when
I'm playing poker, Michael.

26:23.615 --> 26:26.948
Wait a minute, you weren't
kibitzing in that game, were you?

26:27.018 --> 26:30.385
Michael, I was merely helping
Slim sample random possibilities...

26:30.455 --> 26:32.548
and arrive at a computation
using...

26:32.624 --> 26:34.148
Enough, enough.
I'm sorry I asked.

26:34.359 --> 26:36.293
Patch me into the semi,
will you?

26:37.228 --> 26:38.217
Yes, Michael.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.299
Bonnie, put RC on, will ya? I'm
gonna need him out here on this one.

26:41.633 --> 26:42.622
RC.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.168
What about me, Michael? You
know how much I love westerns.

26:46.304 --> 26:47.862
Well, I know, pilgrim.

26:47.939 --> 26:51.431
Maybe I can get you one of
those gutsy Maureen O'Hara roles.

26:52.711 --> 26:55.236
Yo, Michael, you do a great
Jimmy Stewart.

26:56.014 --> 26:57.140
Very funny.

26:58.249 --> 26:59.238
What are we gonna
be doing?

27:00.218 --> 27:02.812
They're shooting the climax
of Raging Sky tomorrow.

27:02.954 --> 27:06.082
It's the Phantom's last chance
to try and sabotage the picture.

27:06.725 --> 27:08.056
You and I are going to stop him.

27:08.126 --> 27:09.115
All right.

27:09.194 --> 27:11.059
Just call us
Phantom-busters!

27:11.229 --> 27:12.594
Not so fast, RC.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.999
It so happens I have some information
which may narrow the possibilities...

27:16.067 --> 27:17.728
as to the Phantom's identity.

27:18.069 --> 27:19.058
What do you got, Devon?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.401
When I was looking into
the insurance...

27:21.506 --> 27:24.942
I checked out the backers
of Raging Sky as well.

27:26.077 --> 27:29.376
Victor Gavin's corporation
isn't his corporation any longer.

27:29.781 --> 27:33.547
Then the $20 million he put up for
the picture really isn't his money.

27:33.618 --> 27:36.712
Exactly. It was provided
by his new partners...

27:36.888 --> 27:39.880
whose capital comes
from tainted sources.

27:41.226 --> 27:44.423
You mean the sort of people
who collect one way or another.

27:44.529 --> 27:45.518
I'm afraid so.

27:46.765 --> 27:50.326
Evidently, they stand to gain more
if the picture isn't completed...

27:50.502 --> 27:51.491
than if it is.

27:53.571 --> 27:54.731
What next?

27:54.806 --> 27:55.966
Stage 28.

27:56.474 --> 27:58.772
Whoever tried to kill me
got past both of us.

27:59.377 --> 28:01.072
I'm gonna find out how.

28:01.312 --> 28:03.212
Well, Hollywood,
here I come.

28:04.215 --> 28:06.342
You bum. I have to stay here.

28:06.551 --> 28:09.543
Hey, well, men have got to do
what men have got to do.

28:44.422 --> 28:46.287
All right, don't be
a wise guy.

28:46.424 --> 28:48.358
You know what? This picture
should be shut down...

28:48.426 --> 28:50.451
and we should be filling
the insurance claims by now.

28:50.595 --> 28:52.222
You still haven't
pulled it off.

28:53.264 --> 28:55.198
Don't push me, Gavin.

28:55.567 --> 28:58.900
This turkey's neck was on the block
until Michael Knight showed up.

28:59.337 --> 29:01.362
You've had two cracks at him
and you've blown them both.

29:02.273 --> 29:04.241
I'll make
the next one count.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.565
You do that.

29:13.017 --> 29:14.006
Silent mode, KITT.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.828
All right. Give me a schematic
on the stage, will you?

29:35.240 --> 29:37.731
See if there's a way out
besides the exits.

29:38.676 --> 29:42.203
I detect a maze of catwalks high
above the floor, but no other exits.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.436
Thank you.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.348
Keep your scanners peeled.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.296
KITT, I think
I've found something.

31:06.364 --> 31:09.356
Get me a fix on the
north side of the stage.

31:09.734 --> 31:10.928
Right away, Michael.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.599
My scan indicates
a concealed exit, Michael.

31:15.673 --> 31:16.662
Thanks, buddy.

32:00.885 --> 32:04.685
You shouldn't involve yourself
in affairs that don't concern you.

32:05.323 --> 32:06.881
Good bye, Mr. Knight.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.662
KITT, KITT,
talk to me, buddy.

32:20.738 --> 32:21.727
Yes, Michael?

32:22.206 --> 32:24.003
Listen, pal, I need a favor.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.037
I'm a little hung up here. You
wanna get in here real fast?

32:27.245 --> 32:28.234
On my way.

32:53.938 --> 32:54.927
Are you all right?

32:55.540 --> 32:56.802
Yeah, I'm fine.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.072
You know,
you're my favorite air bag.

32:59.177 --> 33:00.974
I'm not quite sure how
to take that, Michael.

33:01.045 --> 33:03.513
As a compliment,
until further notice.

33:20.365 --> 33:21.832
Okay, next item.

33:22.467 --> 33:25.368
We're doing that big stunt
sequence tomorrow morning.

33:25.436 --> 33:28.200
Notify studio security. I want every
available guard in the back lot.

33:31.542 --> 33:32.531
Done.

33:32.610 --> 33:33.770
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.278
Yes, well, don't forget
my little friend here.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.842
Well, I caught up with the
Phantom, but he got away.

33:38.983 --> 33:40.143
You have any idea
who it was?

33:40.218 --> 33:42.778
It's either Friar Tuck
or Mr. Gavin.

33:43.488 --> 33:47.652
It turns out that the $20 million he
put into Raging Sky wasn't his own.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.019
As a matter of fact, he's in some
serious debt to some heavy hitters.

33:51.562 --> 33:54.463
Well, let's not be
so surprised, Mr. Knight.

33:54.899 --> 33:58.300
No producer worth his car phone
would use his own money in a movie.

33:58.903 --> 33:59.892
Have you notified
the police?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.700
What am I gonna do? Tell them a
guy who's produced 26 pictures...

34:02.774 --> 34:04.833
is running around the back lot
in a phantom suit?

34:06.377 --> 34:08.538
We gotta catch Mr. Gavin
in the act.

34:38.643 --> 34:39.632
What are you doing here?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.568
I have some bad news
for you.

34:41.646 --> 34:43.170
All right, cut the act,
just lay it on me.

34:47.952 --> 34:52.217
Knight found out that the
organization is backing you.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.848
And that makes them nervous.

34:54.425 --> 34:56.052
You got a job to do.

34:56.561 --> 34:57.550
It's none of your concern.

34:57.662 --> 34:59.721
Of course it is.
That's why I'm here.

34:59.797 --> 35:01.094
To protect their interests.

35:01.165 --> 35:03.565
That's why they insisted
you get me a job on this lot.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.862
It was part of the deal.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.931
What about our deal? I've paid you
a lot of money. You work for me, too.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.866
It's come down to you or them.

35:11.943 --> 35:15.344
And the bottom line is
I'm working for them.

35:15.713 --> 35:19.114
Didn't you learn anything from
all those B movies you've produced?

35:20.485 --> 35:22.214
What are you...
No.

35:43.007 --> 35:45.271
Michael, I'm not happy
about this.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.135
I don't like
leaving you alone.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.610
We don't have
any choice.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.641
You gotta cover the outside,
I'll be on the set.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.581
Yeah, that's where
all the trouble's gonna be.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.213
I still don't like it.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.479
You got a better idea?

36:00.191 --> 36:01.180
Well, I do now.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.623
Yeah. Just make sure you're in
position when the camera's rolling.

36:06.697 --> 36:07.686
All right, I'll be there.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.464
Hi, out of gas?

36:14.939 --> 36:15.928
It's electric.

36:16.707 --> 36:19.767
You don't look it,
but maybe you're out of juice.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.138
Thanks, but the car's been
charging all night.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.707
Do you know anything
about these things?

36:24.782 --> 36:27.046
Just about everything
there is to know.

36:27.218 --> 36:28.207
Pop the hood.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.382
The motor's in the back.

36:33.124 --> 36:34.751
I've only been here
a couple of days.

36:36.994 --> 36:38.757
I have got a great idea.

36:39.830 --> 36:41.195
I'll bet you do.

36:43.234 --> 36:47.762
How about turning
the key to "on?"

36:48.306 --> 36:49.773
Hey, it's running.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.274
And headed right for some
coffee and conversation?

36:53.277 --> 36:54.266
What's your name?

36:54.645 --> 36:56.010
Ellie, and yours?

36:56.314 --> 36:58.407
Reginald Cornelius III...

36:58.516 --> 36:59.983
only, you can call me RC.

37:00.184 --> 37:02.880
Yeah, right, RC,
I've seen you.

37:03.020 --> 37:06.547
You're the guy that runs through the
airport and jumps over the luggage.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.181
Do you like doing
TV commercials?

37:10.294 --> 37:12.489
Yeah. Yeah, you know...

37:12.563 --> 37:15.157
Beats the heck out of
being chased by linebackers.

37:15.499 --> 37:17.057
Why, I remember one game...

37:17.435 --> 37:19.027
big game, Super Bowl.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.764
I was dodging tackles
to the right.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.667
I was dodging tackles
to the left.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.740
And then you know what
happened? No, what?

37:25.576 --> 37:26.565
I scored.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.273
Thanks, Barry.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.086
Okay, listen up.
We're gonna make one.

37:38.389 --> 37:39.378
Got it.

37:39.457 --> 37:41.220
Places, please,
for a run-through.

37:43.127 --> 37:45.857
Okay, KITT, we're getting
real close to showtime.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.530
Just scan all the ammunition
we're using.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.589
Right away, Michael.

37:51.335 --> 37:52.825
The wardrobe's at the set.

37:53.204 --> 37:54.193
Michael...

37:55.172 --> 37:57.163
you know, it's not too late
to change your mind.

37:57.241 --> 37:58.230
Yeah, I know.

37:58.709 --> 38:00.540
It's the last chance
for Gavin to play his hand.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.773
Just be careful, all right?
Thanks.

38:03.848 --> 38:06.817
Michael, my scan indicates
every round is a blank.

38:07.318 --> 38:10.287
Thanks, pal. Looks like Gavin's
got something else in mind, huh?

38:11.155 --> 38:12.679
We're ready, Mr. Knight.

38:13.491 --> 38:14.981
Yeah, come on, Michael.

38:15.059 --> 38:18.654
Every desperate, vulnerable girl on the
run needs a big, strong guy on her side.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.693
Michael, security just found
Gavin in his car.

38:21.866 --> 38:22.855
Dead.

38:25.403 --> 38:26.392
Oh, my God.

38:26.771 --> 38:29.467
That means whoever's been doing
this to us is still around.

38:29.874 --> 38:30.863
Yeah.

38:31.909 --> 38:32.898
Back to square one.

38:33.978 --> 38:34.967
Maybe.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.142
Mr. Knight...

38:39.550 --> 38:40.539
Let's do it, huh?

38:41.919 --> 38:43.784
Keep an eye on us, will you?
Hey, you got it.

38:44.588 --> 38:46.055
Place the background.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.818
Settle, people.
Let's settle.

38:56.867 --> 38:59.836
Makeup. Makeup! Check them.

39:20.458 --> 39:21.447
Now, remember...

39:21.892 --> 39:24.725
Mike and Liz are running
toward the barn.

39:25.596 --> 39:28.224
The car blasts
through the fence after...

39:28.833 --> 39:31.529
after they take out
the bad guys.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.264
Everybody got it?

39:35.172 --> 39:37.231
Okay, people, this is a take.

39:37.942 --> 39:40.467
Lots of energy.
Have fun with it.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.673
All right,
let's go for one.

39:47.551 --> 39:49.951
152, Chicago. Take three.

39:51.288 --> 39:52.277
Marker.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.452
And action.

40:34.765 --> 40:35.891
KITT, get over here.

40:54.518 --> 40:56.110
I didn't cue a black car.

40:56.620 --> 40:57.609
Jump in.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.833
Michael, we can take him out
right here.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.202
No, pal, we don't wanna
endanger any people.

41:19.276 --> 41:20.504
Let's wait for a clear shot.

41:28.552 --> 41:29.541
Look out!

41:30.721 --> 41:32.689
Thank goodness
that was a movie prop.

41:51.575 --> 41:53.304
This place is full
of surprises.

42:29.246 --> 42:30.838
How is he doing that?

42:31.215 --> 42:33.979
I don't know. He's gotta have
some kind of remote hookup.

42:35.252 --> 42:36.844
KITT, you gotta get me
through this.

42:37.288 --> 42:38.550
Leave that to me, Michael.

43:01.612 --> 43:03.045
Get out of the way!

43:08.819 --> 43:11.413
Michael, he's activated
another obstruction for us.

43:11.989 --> 43:13.513
No problem with this one, pal.

43:36.847 --> 43:39.077
Michael, shall we bring
this legend to an end?

43:39.516 --> 43:41.040
Yeah, right now.

44:09.980 --> 44:11.914
Come on, quick.
Right here. Set it here.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.305
Shoot it right there.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.209
Lots of energy.

44:15.552 --> 44:16.610
No sound.

44:16.854 --> 44:18.446
Keep it going, looking good.

44:23.627 --> 44:26.323
KITT, I need a little
distraction, buddy.

44:26.730 --> 44:27.754
Coming right up.

44:51.388 --> 44:52.377
Cut.

44:56.927 --> 44:59.088
Michael, are you okay?

44:59.296 --> 45:01.696
Well, I'm not.
I broke another fingernail.

45:01.765 --> 45:03.323
She broke another fingernail.

45:03.734 --> 45:07.226
But I'm fine. I'm telling ya, I
have a new respect for seafood.

45:07.604 --> 45:09.401
It really does help you
live longer.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.903
Yeah, I'd have been here,
but he got the drop on me.

45:13.010 --> 45:14.841
Oh, Michael,
you were wonderful.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.438
You took a mediocre ending
and you gave it new life.

45:17.948 --> 45:19.415
Have you ever considered
a career in this?

45:19.483 --> 45:21.610
I have a career. I caught
the Phantom, didn't I?

45:21.852 --> 45:25.117
Phantom schmantom, I'm talking
about my picture in Maui.

45:25.522 --> 45:26.955
How would you like to be
the lead?

45:29.526 --> 45:30.515
Are you serious?

45:30.627 --> 45:31.855
Of course, I am.

45:32.029 --> 45:33.462
Hey, now hold on, Tobey.

45:34.865 --> 45:36.833
I represent Mr. Knight.

45:37.334 --> 45:38.596
Now, dollars aside...

45:38.836 --> 45:41.396
will he get a motor home
and script approval?

45:41.872 --> 45:44.340
Michael, don't forget
a parking place in the shade.

45:44.475 --> 45:46.807
You won't need a car, you'll
have a chauffeur-driven limo.

45:46.877 --> 45:48.276
A chauffeur-driven
limousine!

45:48.846 --> 45:49.835
Fantastic!

45:50.347 --> 45:51.439
I'll take it.

45:51.615 --> 45:53.947
No deal, he already
has a contract.

45:55.119 --> 45:57.053
How did that car get here?

45:58.522 --> 45:59.853
Special effects.

46:09.767 --> 46:10.756
Here you go.

46:10.934 --> 46:12.401
Michael, when I said
I wanted...

46:12.469 --> 46:14.596
to treat the guy who saved
the studio millions to lunch...

46:14.671 --> 46:16.229
I meant champagne
and caviar...

46:16.306 --> 46:17.773
not cola and hotdogs.

46:17.841 --> 46:20.332
Karen, after all the trouble
I've had trying to figure out...

46:20.410 --> 46:22.708
what is real and what isn't
real around here...

46:23.514 --> 46:26.347
I need something I can finally
sink my teeth into.

46:26.483 --> 46:28.951
I wish there was something else
I could do to thank you and KITT.

46:29.186 --> 46:30.517
There is one thing,
Ms. Bennett.

46:30.587 --> 46:31.815
When you see Buck and Slim...

46:31.989 --> 46:33.422
remind them it was a car...

46:33.490 --> 46:35.981
that helped run the gunslinger
out of town this time.

46:36.059 --> 46:38.027
Gunslingers, KITT,
gunslingers.

46:38.462 --> 46:41.295
Kent agreed to testify against
the people he was working for.

46:41.765 --> 46:43.460
So you can sit back, relax...

46:43.634 --> 46:45.397
and congratulate yourself
on a job well done.

46:45.469 --> 46:46.458
Relax?

46:46.637 --> 46:50.437
This picture still has to be edited,
scored, marketed, distributed...

46:50.507 --> 46:52.805
Hey, dude,
come on, sit down.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.677
Have some chow,
Karen's buying.

46:54.745 --> 46:59.682
Thanks, but they had a little bash on
the set celebrating Sam Clifford's return.

47:00.017 --> 47:02.781
Champagne, caviar...

47:09.259 --> 47:10.749
I think it's gone to my head.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.421
You don't think?
I think...

47:15.532 --> 47:19.434
that is a man in a monk's robe
riding a bicycle.

47:20.305 --> 47:26.771
