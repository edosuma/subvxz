01:13.441 --> 01:15.376
The Kentrosaurus.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.581
Now's my chance to
solve Dino Experiment 508

01:20.614 --> 01:24.118
and see how you use your
boney spikes for defense.

01:24.152 --> 01:27.321
I'm an Albertosaurus!
Roar!

01:27.355 --> 01:30.224
And I'm gonna eat you
if you don't defend yourself!

01:30.258 --> 01:32.293
Roar!

01:32.326 --> 01:34.828
Whoa!
Powerful tail spikes.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.398
Those aren't the only
spikes you have.

01:37.431 --> 01:40.134
Roaaaarrrrr!

01:40.168 --> 01:43.537
[Kentrosaurus growling]

01:43.571 --> 01:46.407
You've also got super-

But how do you use
your back spikes?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.680
[snorting and growling]

01:52.713 --> 01:54.415
Think, Dana, think.

01:54.448 --> 01:58.219
You're not as big as
a real Albertosaurus...

01:58.252 --> 02:00.421
I'm gonna have to get bigger.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.191
Hm...

02:03.224 --> 02:05.459
Hey, Kentrosaurus,

02:05.493 --> 02:09.163
watch out for THIS
Albertosaurus.

02:09.197 --> 02:10.364
Roar!

02:10.398 --> 02:11.399
Whoa!

02:11.432 --> 02:12.800
You spiked it.

The Kentrosaurus

02:23.744 --> 02:26.314
it swings its sid spikes
to protect its spikes,

02:26.347 --> 02:28.716
it swings its back spikes
to protect its back

02:28.749 --> 02:31.219
from predators
that are trying to eat it,

02:31.252 --> 02:32.586

your bony side spike!

How're you gonna protect your
side without your spike?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.943
You lost one of your defenses.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.446
[Kentrosaurus groans]

03:00.514 --> 03:03.584
It looks like
the Albertosaurus knows it.

03:08.456 --> 03:11.325
[sigh] If you can't beat them,
run from them.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.527
Smart thinking,
Kentrosaurus!

03:13.561 --> 03:14.662
I gotta tell...

03:14.695 --> 03:15.929
- Sara!

Are you okay?!

Ow...

03:21.369 --> 03:22.870
Dana, I think it's broken.

We need Dad.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.307
Ow...
Ow...

03:27.641 --> 03:29.877
Are you even
gonna help me up?

03:29.910 --> 03:31.845
Oh. Yeah...
Yeah.

Ow...

03:37.851 --> 03:39.720
Ow...
Ow.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.522
So...
What happened again?

03:41.555 --> 03:47.695
[sisters talk over each other
with conflicting stories]

03:47.728 --> 03:50.598
...and she bashed into me
and broke my arm!

03:50.631 --> 03:53.834
Because she was sneaking up
on me to try and scare me!

03:53.867 --> 03:56.437
Okay, that part's true,
and I would've...

03:56.470 --> 03:57.838
Ow.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.441
Except she fell back down
on her arm.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.277
So it was an accident and
wasn't anybody's fault?

04:03.311 --> 04:05.245
- Uh...
- My arm!

04:06.714 --> 04:09.283
[both sigh]
No.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.352
And...?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.587
[both]
Sorry.

04:13.621 --> 04:15.623
"Sorry" who?

04:15.656 --> 04:18.526
[both]
Sorry, seester.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.993
That's my girls!

04:20.027 --> 04:21.962
Now that's sorted,
let's get an x-ray,

04:21.995 --> 04:24.365
make sure we're actually
dealing with a broken arm.

04:24.398 --> 04:25.933
Actually,

04:25.966 --> 04:28.936
I already know it's broken
from how much it hurts,

04:28.969 --> 04:31.038
which is ACTUALLY a lot.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.906
Ohhhh... like how much it

04:32.940 --> 04:35.676
"actually" hurt when you
thought you broke your leg?

04:35.709 --> 04:37.411
What's your point, Dad?

04:37.445 --> 04:40.414
Remember how that turned out
to be just a leg cramp?

04:40.448 --> 04:42.416
Or it could've just
healed really quickly!

04:42.450 --> 04:44.318
[sarcastic laugh]

04:44.352 --> 04:46.720
X-ray. Let's go.
You coming, Dana?

04:46.754 --> 04:50.724
I have a dino patient in the
park that I need to check on.

04:50.758 --> 04:51.892
You do that, nugget.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.494
Sara, let's go.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.028
[Sara sighs]

04:55.062 --> 04:57.865

05:08.542 --> 05:10.411
Kentrosaurus!

05:10.444 --> 05:12.680
Sorry about your side spike.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.448
Kentrosaurus!

05:14.482 --> 05:15.816
Where are you?

05:15.849 --> 05:17.050
[nearby growl]

05:17.084 --> 05:18.051
Huh.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.053
Sounds like a Kentrosaurus.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.622
[hiss]

05:21.655 --> 05:23.824
But who's making THAT noise?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.926
[hissing and growling]

05:25.959 --> 05:27.628
Oh no!

05:27.661 --> 05:30.464
The Kentrosaurus is being
attacked by two Dromaeosaurus...

05:30.498 --> 05:33.834
And one of its sides
is defenseless.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.503
This is all my fault.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.371
I shouldn't have distracted
the Kentrosaurus

05:37.405 --> 05:38.906
from the Albertosaurus.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.809
Think, Dana, think!

05:41.842 --> 05:43.944
How would you fight off
two Dromaeosaurus?

05:43.977 --> 05:45.646
[dinosaurs growling and hissing]

05:47.948 --> 05:51.852

With two Kentrosaurus.

05:55.022 --> 05:58.826
[Dana roaring and shouting]

05:59.560 --> 06:00.928
Ah-ha!

06:00.961 --> 06:04.064
56 spikes
are better than 28.

06:05.599 --> 06:07.535
[frightened hissing]

06:07.568 --> 06:09.670
Nice job, Kentrosaurus.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.639
Tail spike high five!

06:12.973 --> 06:14.942
Whoa!
Gentle.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.445
And you'll have to be
careful around predators

06:17.478 --> 06:18.712
until your spike grows back.

06:18.746 --> 06:20.681
Doctor Dana's orders!

06:22.082 --> 06:24.084
And I wonder how long
that'll take.

06:25.753 --> 06:29.022
Please don't touch it.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.591
Dad, you're touching it.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.659
You're tou--

06:31.692 --> 06:34.662
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

06:34.695 --> 06:37.030
I just asked you
not to touch it.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.833
Sara, while we're waiting for
the x-rays to come back,

06:39.867 --> 06:42.603
I wanna see how much
you can move your arm.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.138
I can do this.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.875
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Sara.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.109
Hey, Dana.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.178
- How's your arm?
- Terrible.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.581
I think I have to
get it amputated.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.948
You're not
getting it amputated!

06:54.982 --> 06:56.517
What's "amputated?"

06:56.550 --> 06:58.118
It's what's gonna
happen to me.

06:58.151 --> 07:01.755
It's when a person needs to have
an arm or a leg removed--

07:01.789 --> 07:03.991
but it's NOT
what's happening to Sara.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.894
But if you did have to have
an arm or leg removed,

07:06.927 --> 07:07.895
it just grows back!

07:09.497 --> 07:12.165
Arms and legs
don't grow back, Dana.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.734
Yes, they do!

07:13.767 --> 07:14.902
Don't they, Dad?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.570
Sorry, no.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.906
But the Kentrosaurus lost
its boney side spike!

07:18.939 --> 07:20.508
It has to grow back,

07:20.541 --> 07:22.643
or else he'll be
defenseless forever

07:22.676 --> 07:23.977
and it's all my fault.

07:25.646 --> 07:26.947
Oh, nugget...

07:26.980 --> 07:28.081
Nature's cruel.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.650
Dad, think.

07:29.683 --> 07:31.819
How can you help
a dinosaur that's lost

07:31.852 --> 07:33.654
its boney side spike?

07:33.687 --> 07:36.557
Well, when a human
loses an arm or a leg,

07:36.590 --> 07:38.058
they get a prosthetic,

07:38.091 --> 07:40.694
which is kind of like
a fake one...

07:41.862 --> 07:43.697
...like this.

07:43.731 --> 07:46.166
So you're saying
I need a prosthetic spike

07:46.199 --> 07:49.002
to help the Kentrosaurus
defend itself again?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.971
Uh... okay.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.874
And I should use
this prosthetic arm

07:53.907 --> 07:55.676
for his new prosthetic spike.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.045
Uh, that's actually
really expensive.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.615
Then I should use this cast
for his prosthetic spike,

08:01.649 --> 08:03.851
because it's hard as bone.

08:03.884 --> 08:06.219
That's my demo cast,
but...

08:06.253 --> 08:07.821
sure, okay.

08:07.855 --> 08:09.189
Thanks, Dad!

08:11.859 --> 08:13.827
'Kay, Sara...

08:13.861 --> 08:15.796
I'm just seeing if it fits!

08:20.133 --> 08:24.104
Your new spike is looking good.
Now we just need to test it.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.674
Perfect--

08:26.707 --> 08:28.275
a Dromaeosaurus.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.311

08:31.344 --> 08:33.914

08:38.786 --> 08:42.623

...AND an Albertosaurus!

08:46.059 --> 08:49.997
[hissing and growling]

08:50.030 --> 08:52.766
Sorry, Kentrosaurus.
I hope you pass this test.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.235
[growling, hissing, and roaring]

08:58.105 --> 09:00.107
Back off, Dromi!

09:00.140 --> 09:02.810
[growl]

09:02.843 --> 09:05.879
Home run--
tail swipe!

09:07.347 --> 09:09.883
Watch out for
the Albertosaurus!

09:09.917 --> 09:13.754
[T-Rex loudly snapping jaws]

09:13.787 --> 09:16.123
Yes!
Your new side spike works!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.662
Bye, Kentrosaurus!

09:21.695 --> 09:24.331
Just remember to use
all your spikes every day

09:24.364 --> 09:26.199
to keep the predators away!

09:26.233 --> 09:28.068
[Dad]
Dana!

09:28.101 --> 09:30.137
How's your arm?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.840
We got the x-rays back,
and surprisingly,

09:32.873 --> 09:35.108
Sara's arm isn't broken,
or sprained,

09:35.142 --> 09:36.877
or even bruised.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.178
I want a second opinion.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.880
[chuckle]

09:39.913 --> 09:42.816
How's the Kendra... saura...
doble.... locious?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.952
- Kentrosaurus?
- Yeah, that one.

09:44.985 --> 09:46.186
It was so cool.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.188
I put the new spike on him,

09:48.221 --> 09:51.825
and then two Dromaeosaurus came
with an Albertosaurus,

09:51.859 --> 09:55.228
and they were all like,
"Roar! We wanna eat you!"

09:55.262 --> 09:57.364
And the Kentrosaurus
was all like,

09:57.397 --> 09:59.332
"You can't eat me,
'cause I--"

09:59.366 --> 10:01.669
- Dana, be careful!
- Ow!

10:01.702 --> 10:03.804
[groan]

10:03.837 --> 10:06.373
I think she broke my foot.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.908
We'll get another x-ray.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.142
Another x-ray!

10:09.176 --> 10:11.278
[Sara whimpers]

10:11.311 --> 10:13.714

your other foot.

is get your sister,

I'm a Maiasaura baby,

Why are you using
my baby blankee?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.979
Paleontologists found Maiasaura
bones with tons of eggs.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.781
"Mia" even means good mother!

What does that have to do
with my blankee?

"How Was The Maiasaura
A Good Mother To Its Babies?"

12:01.188 --> 12:02.890
And...?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.759
And I'm using your
baby blankee softer to sit in.

12:05.793 --> 12:09.229
- Can I borrow it, big seester?
- Mom, we talked about this.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.799
Dana, you know you're supposed
to ask BEFORE you take.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.166
You guys weren't home,

12:13.200 --> 12:15.102
and it was in the spot
she keeps her diary!

12:15.135 --> 12:18.238
- Did you read my diary?
- No...

12:18.271 --> 12:21.975
- But who's Dylan?
- I'll wash it when she's done.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.277
Now, why don't you
be a good daughter

12:24.311 --> 12:26.213
and help us bring
the groceries in.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.450
I'll be right up!

12:32.352 --> 12:35.322
...As soon as I finish
my experiment.

12:35.355 --> 12:38.792
[distant rumbling]

12:38.826 --> 12:40.427
What's that sound?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.496
Whoa!

12:45.165 --> 12:47.400
A whole herd of Maiasaura?

12:47.434 --> 12:49.837
[Maiasaurs snorting
and growling]

12:49.870 --> 12:52.205
[mimicking snorts]

12:52.239 --> 12:53.773
They don't see me.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.476
Over here!

12:56.509 --> 12:58.178
I'm your baby!

12:58.211 --> 13:00.113
[mimicking dinos]

13:00.147 --> 13:01.882
Look how cute I am!

13:02.950 --> 13:04.985
Oh no!
They all left!

13:05.018 --> 13:06.319
One more chance.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.122
Let me try it with
my hood on this time.

13:09.156 --> 13:14.094
[Maiasaur snorting]

13:14.127 --> 13:15.362
[giggle]

13:15.395 --> 13:16.496
Awww.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.933
She thinks I'm her baby!

13:19.967 --> 13:21.034
What?

13:21.068 --> 13:23.270
Where are you going?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.872
Oh, wait--

13:24.905 --> 13:26.306
To the lettuce?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.375
[Maiasaur chews]

13:28.408 --> 13:30.410
You're just hungry.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.180
Now how am I gonna solve
Dino Experiment 506,

13:33.213 --> 13:35.282
"How Was The Maiasaura
A Good..."

13:36.616 --> 13:38.185
Bleccchhh!

13:38.218 --> 13:39.319
"...Mom?"

13:41.254 --> 13:42.890
Uh...

13:43.957 --> 13:45.458
Well...

13:45.492 --> 13:47.027
Guess that's your answer.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.229
[sigh]

13:49.262 --> 13:51.331
The Maiasaura was
not a good mom.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.400
She spit lettuce all over me.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.469
Well, I guess there's
no salad tonight.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.471
Dana, what'd you
do to my blankee?

13:58.505 --> 13:59.940
Wasn't me.
It was the Maiasaura.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.241
Really?

14:01.274 --> 14:03.410
Why would a dinosaur
spit on her baby?

14:03.443 --> 14:06.013
- I spit food on you.
- [Dana] What?

14:06.046 --> 14:07.881
- In your mouth.
- Worse.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.283
Sometimes I had to
chew your food for you

14:10.317 --> 14:11.919
before you had teeth.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.120
[sisters]
Gross.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.988
It isn't gross.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.058
It was to help you eat food
you couldn't chew yourself.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.227
Wait, are you saying
the Maiasaura

14:20.260 --> 14:22.095
was trying to
help me eat?

14:22.129 --> 14:23.463
It's possible.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.033
The Maiasaura IS
a good mom to its babies,

14:26.066 --> 14:27.367
because it helped them eat!

14:27.400 --> 14:29.369
Dino Experiment 506 is solved.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.104
Wait--
If they were good moms,

14:31.138 --> 14:32.572
were the Maiasaura
good dads, too?

14:32.605 --> 14:34.141
I don't know.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.543
Its name means "good mom,"
not "good dad."

14:36.576 --> 14:38.278
Lots of animals
have good dads.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.914
Some are so good they even
give birth to the babies,

14:40.948 --> 14:42.549
like seahorses.

14:42.582 --> 14:45.385
Glad I'm not a seahorse...
[mimicking horse] Yayyyy!

14:46.553 --> 14:48.655
- [Dana] Dad!
- [chuckle]

14:48.688 --> 14:51.591
So maybe the Maiasaura
was a good dad!

14:51.624 --> 14:53.961
Dino Experiment 506 update.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.462
I'm gonna need
your blankee again.

14:55.495 --> 14:57.130
No way.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.167
Mom, I asked before I took!
She has to give it.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.568
Her blankee,
her choice.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.004
I bet Dylan would let me...

15:04.037 --> 15:07.340
Fine! Just take it.
[sigh]

15:07.374 --> 15:09.309
[parents]
Who's Dylan?

15:10.477 --> 15:14.347
[***]

15:19.486 --> 15:21.955
[Dana]
There's another Maiasaura?

15:21.989 --> 15:23.023
[roar]

15:23.056 --> 15:25.225
Do you two know each other?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.961
[Maiasaurs groan and snort]

15:27.995 --> 15:29.129
That must be the dad!

15:29.162 --> 15:30.964
Yes!

15:30.998 --> 15:34.434
Now's my chance to see how he
takes care of their babies too.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.270
[Dana imitates Maiasaur snorts]

15:37.304 --> 15:39.406
[Maiasaurs grunt]

15:39.439 --> 15:41.541
Hey, dino dad!

15:41.574 --> 15:43.343
Over here!

15:43.376 --> 15:44.711
I'm your baby!

15:46.379 --> 15:48.348
[sniffing]

15:48.381 --> 15:50.050
So far so good...

15:50.083 --> 15:51.618
[chewing]

15:51.651 --> 15:55.255
Uh oh.
Are you gonna spit on me too?

15:55.288 --> 15:56.623
Here it comes!

15:58.558 --> 16:00.560
Why aren't you spitting on me?

16:00.593 --> 16:03.596
[snort, grunt]

16:03.630 --> 16:04.631
Hey!

16:04.664 --> 16:06.633
Gentle Maiasaura, Dad.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.370
[Maiasaur snorting]

16:10.403 --> 16:12.505
You pushed me out of the nest!

16:12.539 --> 16:15.642
...And got Sar's blankee
super dirty.

16:15.675 --> 16:18.111
Sara's going to be so mad.

16:19.446 --> 16:20.780
Thanks, Dad.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.717
[Maiasaurs groaning
and snorting]

16:29.056 --> 16:30.357
[sigh]

16:30.390 --> 16:33.226
The Maiasaura
was not a good Dad.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.496
- What happened?
- He pushed me out of the nest.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.666
At least my blankee didn't
get covered in dino spit.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.035
Uh, about that...

16:42.069 --> 16:43.436
Dana!

16:43.470 --> 16:46.039
Sorry, seester.
Dino Experiments are messy.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.475
He stepped on it.
Worst dino dad ever.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.078
Can you believe he
pushed me out of the nest?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.312
Hold on there!

16:52.345 --> 16:54.181
Sometimes kids
need a little nudge.

16:54.214 --> 16:56.516
Sara, remember when you
wouldn't go into the classroom

16:56.549 --> 16:59.119
on your first day of school
and I had to push you?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.787
- No.
- Well, ya did.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.222
And now you love school--

17:02.255 --> 17:04.224
and apparently someone
named Dylan,

17:04.257 --> 17:06.226
which we will
talk about later.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.095
So you're saying
the Maiasaura dad

17:08.128 --> 17:10.497
was trying to teach me
to leave the nest?

17:10.530 --> 17:11.631
Why not?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.633
So the Maiasaura is a good dad!

17:13.666 --> 17:16.069
Dino Experiment 506 update
is solved!

17:17.137 --> 17:18.505
Boom!

17:18.538 --> 17:21.408
Uh, do you need some
help with dinner?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.110
Uh, yes, please.

y'know, parenting.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.813
[Mom chuckles]

17:29.216 --> 17:31.084
So the mom is good,

17:31.118 --> 17:33.220
and the dad is good...

17:33.253 --> 17:35.122
but are they good together?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.658
Only one way to find out!

17:38.691 --> 17:40.760
Just leave my blankee
out of it!

[sigh]

be working together.

I hope they do it quick.

[dinos growl menacingly

is...

taking on the T-Rex

18:32.345 --> 18:35.182
while the dad is
protecting me.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.517
Oh no!
I think the T-Rex sees me.

What?
Why am I going up?

Whoa!

18:46.426 --> 18:48.661
You're carrying me away
from the danger!

18:48.695 --> 18:50.263
Thanks, Maiasaura Dad.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.748
Nice team work,
Maiasaura Mom and Dad.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.284
You worked together

19:44.317 --> 19:45.618
to guard the nest

19:45.652 --> 19:47.920
and protect me.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.690

Dana, dinner time!

Gotta go, dinos.

19:53.460 --> 19:56.663
[Maiasaurs groan and snort]

The Maiasaura's
a good mom, a good dad,

20:00.733 --> 20:02.235
and they work together!

20:02.269 --> 20:03.603
But the most incredible thing

20:03.636 --> 20:06.005
is that while I was
learning all of that,

20:06.038 --> 20:08.475
I also washed Sara's blankee!

20:08.508 --> 20:09.776
Oh...

It's still wet.
