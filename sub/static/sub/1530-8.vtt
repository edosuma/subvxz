00:09.720 --> 00:13.247
In ancient times,
people believed the heavens were filled

00:13.320 --> 00:16.767
with gods and monsters
and magical worlds.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.488
Then, as time passed, those beliefs
faded into myth and folklore.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.400
But now we know the stories were true.

00:24.480 --> 00:27.768
Other worlds, with names
like Asgard, do exist.

00:27.880 --> 00:31.327
And beings once revered as gods,
like Thor, have returned.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.849
Leaving us with more questions

00:33.920 --> 00:36.002
and an enormous mess to clean up.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.962
Don't say I never gave you anything.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.647
Checking for alien
spectrographic signatures,

00:45.720 --> 00:47.404
one teeny rock at a time.

00:47.480 --> 00:48.641
A necessary precaution.

00:48.720 --> 00:51.041
We don't want anything alien
getting in the wrong hands.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.806
Still, this is definitely the type of work
a monkey could easily do.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.086
You're our little monkey.

01:02.680 --> 01:06.082
Don't give me that look.
I'll talk to them when I talk to them.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.601
- Talk to who?
-Mum and Dad.

01:08.680 --> 01:11.081
They want explanations
and answers for...

01:11.160 --> 01:12.924
Well, all this.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.570
But I don't have any answers.

01:14.640 --> 01:16.927
And more importantly,
I haven't talked to them since I was ill.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.480
And if they knew that, they'd be
even more terrified, so, you know.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.082
Why waste any of our time, really?

01:25.120 --> 01:27.964
You guys may think it's old news,
but it's new news to everybody else.

01:28.040 --> 01:30.646
So, Asgardians are aliens
from another planet

01:30.720 --> 01:33.769
-that visited us thousands of years ago.
-Or more.

01:33.840 --> 01:35.763
And because
we couldn't understand aliens,

01:35.840 --> 01:37.285
we thought they were gods?

01:37.360 --> 01:39.601
That's where our
Norse mythology comes from.

01:39.680 --> 01:40.920
That's too crazy.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.923
Do you think other deities
are aliens, too?

01:43.040 --> 01:44.610
Vishnu for sure, right?

01:44.680 --> 01:47.843
You know, it'd be nice if,
for once, Thor and his people

01:47.960 --> 01:50.486
sent down the god of
cleaning-up-after-yourself.

01:50.560 --> 01:52.642
He'd probably have a magic broom
for this kind of thing.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.291
I just wish they'd left
their alien ship behind.

01:55.360 --> 01:57.966
- So we can clean that up, too?
-So we could go inside.

01:58.040 --> 02:01.010
Take a peek under the hood,
maybe take it for a spin.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.127
Come on, you're telling me

02:02.200 --> 02:04.771
piloting an alien ship
isn't on your bucket list?

02:04.840 --> 02:05.966
I can't think of a single time

02:06.040 --> 02:08.645
when anything alien
in human hands ended well.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.644
Wouldn't mind getting
my human hands on Thor.

02:11.720 --> 02:12.801
He's so dreamy.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.325
Sure, he's handsome, but...

02:14.400 --> 02:16.050
No. He's dreamy.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.131
Fitz, is that... um...

02:24.200 --> 02:27.010
Definitely not from here.
Another piece of the ship.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.127
What are you doing?

02:31.240 --> 02:32.366
Out of sight,

02:35.080 --> 02:36.206
out of mind.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.320
It's why we're here.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.209
To keep everything under control.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.527
Now, who would
do something like that?

03:08.600 --> 03:10.011
Ah, who knows?

03:27.160 --> 03:28.764
Baby, look.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.081
"South of the water,
north of the hill,

03:37.960 --> 03:39.200
"a halo of stones..."

03:39.320 --> 03:41.129
"Protect the tree, still."

03:42.200 --> 03:45.409
Jakob. IS this it?

04:06.920 --> 04:08.843
We should check that out.

04:40.720 --> 04:42.290
Finally, after all this time.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.048
I can't wait to tell the others.

04:52.320 --> 04:56.041
I told you it was real.
And that I would find it.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.842
Are you ready?

05:16.600 --> 05:18.489
What you're feeling, don't fight it.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.928
- That rage, it's already inside of you.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.480
Don't be afraid of it.
Don't hide from its power.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.927
- Embrace it! Embrace it!

05:34.440 --> 05:37.011
Oh, God!
What have you done?

05:50.840 --> 05:52.444
I can climb it if you want.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.129
Just talk me through what to do
with the doodads.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.048
Yeah, it's only about 15 feet.

05:59.120 --> 06:00.167
I'll be fine.

06:00.240 --> 06:02.288
I'm just a bit more wary
about the height thing,

06:02.360 --> 06:03.566
since falling to certain death...

06:03.640 --> 06:04.766
You're afraid?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.121
Hmm?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.601
Shaken up? It's normal.

06:11.840 --> 06:15.447
But some feelings will take over
if you dwell on them.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.681
Especially fear.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.731
Now, keep your eyes ahead,

06:21.800 --> 06:25.088
focus on what you like to do best.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.161
Yep.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.204
Not falling.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.203
No, research.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.521
You're a scientist,
you like to figure things out.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.489
Yes, with my doodads.

06:34.560 --> 06:35.766
I'm curious.

06:36.560 --> 06:40.121
Whatever was up in these trees
had to be there for centuries, right?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.281
At least a millennium.

06:41.360 --> 06:44.364
Radiocarbon-14 dates some of
these trees at 9,000 years old.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.762
That sounds impossible.
You think the tree grew around it?

06:47.840 --> 06:51.322
I'd have to check the dendrochronology
first to know for certain.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.449
But, I mean, the Norway spruce
is a rather fast-growing coniferous.

06:54.520 --> 06:57.603
And I know you're trying to trick me
into going up, but I'm going up anyway.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.682
I'll catch you if you fall.

07:00.200 --> 07:03.921
...screaming, so much
hate in her eyes.

07:05.480 --> 07:08.086
And you said she had a silver stick?

07:08.160 --> 07:12.245
Steel, maybe, I don't know.
It, um, it had decorations on it.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.004
Could you describe or draw them?

07:14.120 --> 07:18.091
I didn't get a good look.
 I just ran.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.924
Who would do something so evil?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.604
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:24.680 --> 07:27.524
- Huh, um...

07:27.600 --> 07:30.365
Whatever was in here
was definitely not from this world.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.762
Fitz, you getting this?
It's not Chitauri, is it?

07:33.840 --> 07:36.605
No. No, no, don't worry.
This isn't another viral threat.

07:36.680 --> 07:37.886
Um... Hang on.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.050
Spectrographic signatures
match readings from Thor's hammer.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.406
Simmons, whatever was
in that tree is Asgardian.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.085
I can see an imprint
of what was embedded.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.691
Scanning for three-dimensional
restoration. Tell me when.

08:00.240 --> 08:01.730
When.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.211
Um...

08:03.280 --> 08:06.090
Looks like a staff or a rod.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.047
Well-crafted, engraved.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.488
I'll convert it, print a 3D model.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.006
This forest is a protected reserve.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.844
I mean, who do they think they are?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.843
Anything else? Details?

08:19.920 --> 08:22.161
Anything that might help us
to find these people

08:22.240 --> 08:23.321
or where they might be hiding?

08:23.440 --> 08:26.284
Sir, it doesn't look like they're hiding.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.364
...in an attempt to
stop the growing violence.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.807
Sending to your devices now.

08:31.920 --> 08:34.048
The rioting has left 20 injured,

08:34.120 --> 08:35.690
three in critical condition.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.491
Reports indicate
that the group of about a dozen

08:38.559 --> 08:40.130
was led by this man and woman.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.770
And though their motive was unclear,

08:41.840 --> 08:44.684
their message was hauntingly
spelled out on the streets of Oslo.

08:46.680 --> 08:49.126
Well, I guess we know
who they think they are.

08:56.640 --> 09:00.042
Jakob Nystrom, 30.
Girlfriend, Petra Larsen.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.521
Leaders of a Norse
paganist hate group.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.090
And the numbers are growing,

09:04.160 --> 09:06.731
thanks to what happened in Greenwich,
and thanks to the Internet.

09:06.800 --> 09:08.211
"Yay, internet," she said sarcastically.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.406
Norse paganist?

09:09.480 --> 09:12.006
Obsessed with anything
derived from Norse mythology.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.121
Stories of Asgard.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.402
And now a weapon.

09:15.480 --> 09:17.403
The scan only accounted for one side.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.289
Too much damage to the tree
for complete reproduction.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.362
But see here?
It's clearly broken on both ends.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.364
- So there are more pieces?
-Yeah. Two, at least.

09:24.440 --> 09:27.250
Which means Sid and Nancy
may be looking for a complete set.

09:28.400 --> 09:31.165
- The markings?
-Asgardian symbolism.

09:31.240 --> 09:32.844
Hard to translate
with our limited knowledge.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.571
You should give your buddy,
the God of Thunder a shout.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.165
He gets his power
from his hammer, right?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.242
What if this is his nail to the hammer?

09:39.320 --> 09:42.403
I already did. Director Fury
told me he's off the grid.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.801
And if he has a cell phone,
we don't have the number.

09:44.880 --> 09:46.120
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s investigations

09:46.200 --> 09:48.441
are on the trail of Nystrom
and his followers.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.761
We're charged with
identifying the object

09:50.840 --> 09:53.002
and finding any other pieces
before they do.

09:53.080 --> 09:54.570
They seem to have some advantage.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.042
They found this thing in 150 square
kilometers of Norwegian forest.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.523
Guys, what if it called to them
with magic?

10:03.400 --> 10:04.447
Called to them?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.364
We know it's Asgardian,
so the rules are a little bendy here.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.965
Just because we don't
understand something yet

10:09.040 --> 10:11.691
doesn't mean we should regress
back to the Dark Ages,

10:11.840 --> 10:14.081
talking of magic and fairytale.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.846
Actually, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

10:17.920 --> 10:18.921
- Excuse me?
-Really?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.764
When we first found the hammer
in New Mexico,

10:20.840 --> 10:23.491
I consulted one of the world's
leading experts on Norse mythology.

10:23.600 --> 10:26.729
Elliot Randolph. A professor
at a university in Seville.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.040
We'll leave immediately.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.566
Maybe he can tell us more
about these markings.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.569
Well, one must adapt, Elena.

10:34.680 --> 10:37.411
Recent events
have thrown us all for a loop.

10:37.520 --> 10:39.807
I thought I was teaching
Norse mythology.

10:39.880 --> 10:43.043
No, turns out, I'm a history professor.

10:43.520 --> 10:46.569
So, you're not going to
change my grade?

10:46.640 --> 10:49.769
No. I will give you a week to rewrite it.

10:49.840 --> 10:53.765
I think, in general,
little more history, less lit crit.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.611
But I do hope we're still on
for dinner tonight.

10:56.680 --> 11:00.048
I've included a list of books there
that might help you.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.724
I'll see you later.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.291
- Professor Randolph.
-Agent Coulson. Come in, come in.

11:07.760 --> 11:12.800
Waterfield 44. 14 karat gold nib
with mother-of-pearl inlay.

11:12.920 --> 11:14.922
That's quite an eye you've got.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.365
I didn't know you were a collector.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.124
On a government salary, not quite.

11:18.200 --> 11:21.522
Well, I'm assuming you found
something on the ground in London?

11:21.600 --> 11:23.682
In a tree in Norway, and unfortunately,

11:23.760 --> 11:25.728
we weren't the ones who found it.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.404
It's a 3D model.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.566
Oh, that is amazing.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.049
Well, based on these runes,

11:38.120 --> 11:42.284
I'd say I'm looking at a piece
of the Berserker staff.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.765
Let's have a look.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.523
Yeah, the myth dates back
to the late 12th century.

11:48.600 --> 11:52.002
It's all about a powerful warrior
from Asgard. Here.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.082
A soldier in the Berserker Army.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.525
Berserker Army?

11:56.280 --> 12:00.001
Oh, yeah. A powerful army.
Fierce army, it was.

12:00.120 --> 12:04.967
Berserkers battled like raging beasts,
destroying everything in their path.

12:05.040 --> 12:08.283
A single Berserker
had the strength of 20 warriors.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.091
So whoever wielded the staff
got superhuman strength?

12:11.160 --> 12:14.767
Fighting with it put the warrior
into a state of uncontrollable rage.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.481
The staff contained
a very powerful magic.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.325
Or a scientific attribute
we've yet to discover.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.243
Analytically-minded
and pretty as a peach.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.765
The warrior in the story?

12:23.840 --> 12:26.764
Well, in the story,
he came to Earth to fight,

12:26.840 --> 12:29.286
but he ended up falling in love.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.600
With whom?

12:30.680 --> 12:34.048
With life on Earth.
Humanity.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.645
He fell so much in love that,

12:35.720 --> 12:38.371
when his army returned to Asgard,
he stayed behind.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.442
What happened to the staff?

12:40.520 --> 12:44.047
Well, he didn't want its dark magic
falling into the wrong hands.

12:44.120 --> 12:49.445
So he broke it into three pieces,
and hid each one in a different location.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.842
The manuscript wouldn't happen to say
where he hid them, would it?

12:52.920 --> 12:56.288
Actually, it does.
In three verses.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.725
Now, let's all bear in mind,

12:57.800 --> 13:00.849
these are poetic abstracts
from long-lost ancient texts.

13:01.120 --> 13:06.126
So, there is one about a tree,
which they found, it seems.

13:06.560 --> 13:10.690
Another is, "East of the river,
sun overhead.

13:10.760 --> 13:13.161
"Buried in earth
with the bones of the dead."

13:13.240 --> 13:14.765
That's a bit macabre, isn't it?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.490
And there's another here.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.005
Well, this one
doesn't even have a rhyme.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.724
But the gist of it is "close to God."

13:22.560 --> 13:25.211
- That could be anything, couldn't it?
-Could also mean nothing.

13:25.600 --> 13:29.446
I was hoping for less metaphor,
more longitude and latitude.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.363
Well, I mean, it does stand to reason

13:32.440 --> 13:35.171
to search near
Viking raid routes, doesn't it?

13:35.240 --> 13:38.005
There have been some
recent interesting findings

13:38.080 --> 13:41.971
of Norse relics on Baffin Island,
off the coast of Canada.

13:42.040 --> 13:44.441
Yeah, a virtual treasure trove
of new artifacts.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.126
We'll start there then.
Thank you, Professor.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.722
Did you know there's
a Mount Thor on Baffin Island?

13:49.800 --> 13:50.847
I did not.

13:50.920 --> 13:54.242
You know what's not on Mount Thor?
Anything Asgardian at all.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.084
Our agents on the ground
haven't found a thing.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.241
What about you?

13:57.320 --> 14:00.403
Nystrom's Deep Web message boards
are just abuzz with psychos.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.528
They believe they're gonna
ascend to be the

14:02.600 --> 14:04.921
"gods of destruction and death."
People suck, sir.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.764
That's your progress? People suck?

14:06.840 --> 14:09.525
These people do. And there's also
chatter about going underground.

14:09.600 --> 14:11.045
Could mean going incognito...

14:11.160 --> 14:12.730
Or searching for the next piece.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.041
Randolph said to check Viking routes.
Find any others?

14:15.120 --> 14:16.963
There's some sites along
the Volga River in Russia.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.805
Some in Kiev, and, weirdly, here.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.565
In Seville, Spain?

14:22.640 --> 14:24.927
It's a long shot,
but Vikings sacked Seville twice.

14:25.360 --> 14:28.842
We found one promising location
with Viking relics.

14:28.960 --> 14:33.249
El Divino Nifio, a church built
on the ruins of an 8th century crypt,

14:33.320 --> 14:35.288
built on Roman ruins from 206 BC.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.761
- East of a river.
-And lots of bones.

14:37.840 --> 14:40.969
Let's see what we can dig up.
See what I did there?

14:47.120 --> 14:50.567
Must be nice.
Have a mandatory nap time.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.130
Siesta isn't mandatory.

14:55.360 --> 14:56.930
Just very pleasant.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.169
- How you doing, Agent Ward?
-Wishing I was shorter.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.008
Nothing yet.
All my readings are normal.

15:04.160 --> 15:05.400
What about you, Skye? Any luck?

15:05.480 --> 15:09.201
I'm lucky my S.O. volunteered
to take the super creepy hallway,

15:09.280 --> 15:14.002
instead of the slightly less creepy
dungeon room place.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.208
I got nothing. Sony, nada.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.011
Ward, your spectrograph
is reading something near you.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.046
I don't see anything.

15:21.680 --> 15:24.604
Well, it's right in front of you.

15:24.680 --> 15:27.763
Oh, wait, no. Uh, okay, hold on.
It's moving. Northwest.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.171
Visual contact.

15:29.280 --> 15:30.850
Okay, Ward, turn left.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.728
I have a wonderful explanation.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.450
Ran into some unexpected...

15:47.680 --> 15:50.729
- Ward, what's happening?
-His device just went down.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.087
- Skye, can you get...
- Already on it.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.803
Ward, are you all right?

15:58.200 --> 16:00.328
Hey, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.448
Grant, calm down.
Oh, my God, please.

16:04.280 --> 16:05.611
Calm down.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.011
The staff, he has it.

16:11.960 --> 16:13.689
Something's wrong with Ward.

16:14.160 --> 16:16.162
The staff's gone. Someone took it.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.120
I have one, too.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.171
He can't just disappear.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.641
--He'll have to turn up somewhere.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.649
There we go.
A block south of the church.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.849
- Professor?
-I screwed up.

17:11.119 --> 17:13.281
- This is ridiculous.
-it's anything but.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.682
Ward, you passed out.
And you were acting not right.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.329
Coulson ordered me
to give you a full work up,

17:18.400 --> 17:20.242
and that's exactly what I'm doing.

17:20.640 --> 17:25.123
Um, before you lost consciousness,
were you feeling claustrophobic?

17:25.560 --> 17:27.688
- Why?
-She's ruling out a panic attack.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.649
I don't panic. Ever.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.404
There we go. Ruled out.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.970
Touching the staff caused it, right?

17:33.080 --> 17:36.482
Any residual effects?
Are you exhibiting any extra strength?

17:37.840 --> 17:39.365
Why don't I find out on that guy?

17:39.440 --> 17:41.647
Why don't we not do that?

17:41.720 --> 17:44.485
What's the last thing you remember
before you lost consciousness?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.562
This is a waste of time.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.725
We need to find the staff.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.962
What exactly did you remember?

17:51.040 --> 17:53.088
Something I hadn't thought about
in a long time.

17:53.160 --> 17:54.400
Why don't we leave it alone?

17:54.480 --> 17:55.891
I mean, he just pulled his arm out...

17:55.960 --> 17:57.007
Quiet!

17:59.120 --> 18:01.009
I want to hear this.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.286
One of my men is hurt,
the staff is gone...

18:06.360 --> 18:09.887
I didn't want any of that to happen.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.291
What did you want?

18:12.760 --> 18:16.048
- The staff's power for yourself?
-Nothing like that.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.283
You know, I just wanted to be
the first to study it.

18:22.280 --> 18:25.204
To prove that the Berserkers
were actually here,

18:25.280 --> 18:26.361
a part of history.

18:28.360 --> 18:30.203
You think about that.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.282
Oh, I'm thinking about it.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.006
What are you doing?

18:35.080 --> 18:37.287
Your heart rate's rising,
adrenaline's spiking.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.362
You need to calm down,
not get worked up.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.565
The memory, was it about your brother?

18:51.600 --> 18:52.647
Drop it.

18:52.720 --> 18:55.451
Ward, if you need to get it out,
I am here...

18:55.520 --> 18:57.284
Right. To talk.

18:58.280 --> 19:02.649
Because that's what you do.
Talk and talk.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.443
Don't you ever get tired
of hearing your own voice?

19:07.080 --> 19:08.241
Ward, stop.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.489
Well, this makes more sense.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.770
Ward, what you're experiencing,
this feeling? It's chemistry.

19:14.880 --> 19:15.961
Hope so.

19:16.040 --> 19:18.327
Yeah, spikes in his
adrenocorticotropic hormone.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.164
It's like those stories you hear

19:20.240 --> 19:22.971
when a mother is able
to lift a car to save her baby.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.088
An adrenaline surge
can create a massive...

19:25.160 --> 19:28.926
Stop talking! Just fix it!

19:29.000 --> 19:32.607
I wish I could. We can relieve
some of the symptoms.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.844
I'm going to give you
10 cc's of benzodiazepine.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.206
Chill pill. Good idea.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.840
A sedative? Not gonna happen.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.287
Yeah, well, be reasonable.
Look how you're behaving.

19:43.360 --> 19:46.921
And if I'm sedated and we cross
paths with those juiced freaks,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.083
the ones who flip cars
and smash people up,

19:50.160 --> 19:52.686
are you gonna take them on?
Keep us safe?

19:52.760 --> 19:56.685
Or am I gonna have to save
Simmons' ass again?

20:03.240 --> 20:07.131
That was just a biochemical reaction.
He didn't mean all that.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.362
- No, I know.
- No explanation necessary.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.204
- How'd they find it?
-I have no idea how they found it.

20:11.280 --> 20:15.080
They may have the original texts.
I wasn't involved.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.611
You know, it was just a chance
to uncover something

20:18.680 --> 20:21.968
that the gods brought down
from the heavens.

20:22.040 --> 20:24.771
Aliens brought it. From space.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.531
I've spent some one-on-one time
with aliens before.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.806
Didn't work out too well.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.961
So cases like this are personal to me.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.526
That's all I know.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.525
Get comfortable.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.886
Help me!

21:08.280 --> 21:10.248
Please! Help me!

21:10.840 --> 21:12.365
Help me!

21:12.880 --> 21:14.041
Ward!

21:15.040 --> 21:16.326
Hey, Ward!

21:17.760 --> 21:19.250
You should be more careful.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.890
I'm fine. You?

21:22.080 --> 21:24.128
I'm working it out.

21:24.520 --> 21:26.010
You're punching things.

21:26.360 --> 21:29.170
The last thing you need
is to punch things.

21:31.360 --> 21:32.725
You got a better idea?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.890
Let me help you.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.689
The only help I need
is to stop those guys

21:36.760 --> 21:38.205
before they hurt somebody else.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.648
We are the new order!

21:50.720 --> 21:52.722
Our world is being taken by gods!

21:53.160 --> 21:55.481
We will become gods and take it back!

21:55.560 --> 21:57.562
This is the new order!

22:04.760 --> 22:06.649
Are you ready to take back the power?

22:29.920 --> 22:31.684
- A moment, sir?
-Come on in.

22:34.960 --> 22:37.088
I'm concerned that
my exposure to that weapon

22:37.160 --> 22:39.731
has compromised my ability
to do my job.

22:40.640 --> 22:41.641
Go on.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.449
You're familiar with my family history?

22:44.440 --> 22:49.890
So, for obvious reasons,
I don't think back to childhood. Ever.

22:49.960 --> 22:54.568
There are things I put away
a long time ago, on lockdown.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.487
Because to do this,
I have to be focused, tactical.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.331
I can't be distracted.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.841
Especially by things
that happened a lifetime ago.

23:03.920 --> 23:06.764
You're saying touching the staff
unlocked certain memories?

23:07.960 --> 23:09.405
My worst memory.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.801
The first time I felt hate.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.850
And it won't go away.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.410
I don't trust myself.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.771
The way I went off at Skye
and Fitz-Simmons in the lab...

23:24.880 --> 23:26.450
Grant,

23:26.520 --> 23:30.491
you telling me this
makes me feel I can trust you.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.644
Him, on the other hand...

23:38.160 --> 23:40.606
I can't get the Professor to talk.

23:42.120 --> 23:44.487
You've got some rage built up.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.967
Maybe it's time to let it out.

23:55.720 --> 23:57.449
You need to start talking.

23:58.400 --> 24:01.131
I told Agent Coulson everything I know.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.406
You're lying.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.563
Tell me what that thing did to me
and how to fix it.

24:05.640 --> 24:07.688
I swear, I don't know.

24:08.520 --> 24:09.681
Okay, then.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.803
You were right.
He's Asgardian.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.524
Good thing.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.524
Otherwise that would've been
awfully embarrassing.

24:34.080 --> 24:38.688
Okay, I have to know.
How did you figure me out?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.291
Did the math.

24:40.360 --> 24:43.682
One, you're not the first Asgardian
I've had in custody.

24:43.760 --> 24:46.331
You guys don't flinch
or panic in captivity.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.371
Two, a Waterfield 44
on a lit professor's salary?

24:50.440 --> 24:51.965
I don't think so.

24:52.040 --> 24:53.280
And lastly,

24:53.360 --> 24:57.081
when I tell someone I've had
some one-on-one time with an alien,

24:57.160 --> 24:59.288
they tend to be a little curious.

24:59.360 --> 25:03.126
Well, you're certainly more observant
than most, Agent Coulson.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.082
So, you're the Asgardian
warrior who stayed.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.164
Please don't tell anyone.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.403
I had no clue. Did you?

25:14.480 --> 25:18.280
Hidden in plain sight.
An actual Asgardian. Brilliant.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.245
How long do you suppose
he's been on our planet?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.129
A thousand years, maybe more.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.567
If we could just cut him open a little bit,

25:25.640 --> 25:27.802
get some tissue samples,
maybe some bodily fluids,

25:27.920 --> 25:29.001
we could find out.

25:29.080 --> 25:31.082
Or we could just ask him, weirdo.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.322
This is way, way better
than The History Channel.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.006
I mean, this guy has lived through
all the scary stuff.

25:36.080 --> 25:38.686
The Crusades, the Black Death, disco.

25:38.760 --> 25:39.886
--What're you doing?

25:39.960 --> 25:42.201
Sealing the interrogation room door.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.326
Coulson's orders.

25:46.800 --> 25:50.361
Ah, locking me in.
Well, I've been in tighter spots.

25:50.440 --> 25:54.240
This room is made of a silicon
carbide-coated vibranium alloy.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.209
Meant for prisoners like yourself.

25:56.280 --> 25:57.770
But you're in here, too.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.411
And eventually,
somebody will open that door.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.130
Not if I tell them not to.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.847
So, the myth is your autobiography?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.007
I didn't write it.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.526
I didn't want anyone to know about me.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.961
Then I had to open my big mouth.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.963
Were you captured? Tortured?

26:15.840 --> 26:16.887
Horny.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.850
I met a French girl in 1546.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.650
God, she loved stories.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.762
So I told her a great one.

26:26.320 --> 26:31.531
All about the peaceful
Asgardian warrior who stayed.

26:31.600 --> 26:33.921
Now, how was I to know
her brother, the priest,

26:34.000 --> 26:35.968
would write it all down and turn it into,

26:36.040 --> 26:37.166
I don't know, a thing?

26:37.280 --> 26:38.520
Do you know Thor?

26:38.600 --> 26:42.366
Oh, sure. I spent all my days palling
around with the future king of Asgard.

26:42.440 --> 26:43.930
No, I don't know Thor.

26:45.080 --> 26:48.368
I was a mason. I broke rocks.

26:48.720 --> 26:53.248
For thousands of years,
if you can imagine that.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.846
So when they came asking
for people to fight,

26:55.920 --> 26:57.888
yes, 'course I signed up.

26:59.320 --> 27:02.290
I think, really, I just wanted to travel.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.089
But you had the staff.

27:04.160 --> 27:05.366
I hated that thing.

27:05.440 --> 27:08.762
Other guys loved all the power
that comes with the rage.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.681
No. I didn't like it at all.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.042
And you don't either, it seems.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.045
What did it do to me?

27:18.240 --> 27:22.245
It shines a light into your dark places.

27:22.320 --> 27:27.406
Doesn't matter if you're human,
Asgardian, the effect is the same.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.488
Unpleasant.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.688
"Shines a light"?
That's no explanation.

27:32.760 --> 27:37.243
It was forged from a rare metal
and reacts to whoever is holding it.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.129
Or interacts.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.401
I went to such great lengths
to make sure

27:42.480 --> 27:44.926
that the staff wasn't found.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.403
Unfortunately, since the myth
was written down,

27:48.520 --> 27:52.206
people have been searching
for it for centuries.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.045
I need your help to stop them before
they get the last piece of your staff.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.043
No. I am a pacifist now.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.329
And you don't want to risk
your identity being discovered.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.449
Listen, I wouldn't worry too much
about these angry youths.

28:03.520 --> 28:05.648
They always calm down.

28:06.320 --> 28:10.006
And eventually,
they die of old age.

28:10.560 --> 28:14.326
And that is one of the
pleasant aspects of life here.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.970
Everything changes.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.370
I'll tell you what's gonna change.
Your anonymity.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.284
Unless you help us find
the final piece of your staff.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.446
You may not know Thor, but I do.

28:34.160 --> 28:38.131
My first love on this planet was Ireland.

28:38.200 --> 28:39.725
There was a monastery,

28:39.800 --> 28:43.009
and the monks gave me
a nice warm place to sleep,

28:43.080 --> 28:46.766
some soup,
and some mulled wine.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.331
"Near God."

29:06.000 --> 29:09.766
The effects of the staff,
are they permanent?

29:09.840 --> 29:11.729
The strength wears off.

29:12.400 --> 29:16.200
You will feel exhausted.
Afterwards, you'll need sleep.

29:16.280 --> 29:18.681
What about the other effects?

29:19.360 --> 29:22.489
Oh, that dark, nasty ache
in the pit of your stomach?

29:23.320 --> 29:25.607
The rage in your chest
that makes you feel

29:25.680 --> 29:27.921
as if your heart's about to explode?

29:29.240 --> 29:31.242
It's worse on humans.

29:31.320 --> 29:35.086
But give it a few decades
and it'll wear off, too.

29:35.520 --> 29:36.760
Great.

29:41.360 --> 29:44.250
Are you sure Ward's okay
to go into the field?

29:44.520 --> 29:46.443
He's not exactly acting like himself.

29:47.080 --> 29:50.004
But he knows it.
He'll be fine.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.529
I'm with Coulson.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.809
It's been a while.
I wonder... Ah! Yes.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.721
There it is.
Still here.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.927
Well, the nose isn't quite right, but...

30:12.080 --> 30:13.525
That's you?

30:13.600 --> 30:15.728
Yeah. They venerated
me a bit as a saint.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.801
They're idiots.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.806
- Where's the staff?
-it's upstairs.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.527
Was that the normal Ward,
or the new, angrier Ward?

30:26.600 --> 30:27.726
I can't tell.

30:30.400 --> 30:31.401
It's quiet.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.608
Why do you think
I trusted them with my secret?

30:33.680 --> 30:35.284
They take a vow of silence.

30:37.680 --> 30:42.129
But when you get them talking,
they squeal.

30:43.120 --> 30:46.567
If you want to defeat a god,
you must become one.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.204
We need to help him!

31:10.480 --> 31:11.845
I'll get her.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.247
How is he?

31:15.320 --> 31:17.448
I don't know what to do.
He's not human!

31:17.560 --> 31:18.925
- He's dying.
- Yeah, we know,

31:19.000 --> 31:20.331
but she doesn't understand
his anatomy...

31:21.480 --> 31:23.244
- Oh, my God!
-What in God's name...

31:23.360 --> 31:26.603
Sometimes you have to just
jump in and figure things out.

31:26.680 --> 31:30.082
Now, Asgardians regenerate
faster than we do.

31:30.200 --> 31:31.690
Maybe we can keep him
alive long enough...

31:31.760 --> 31:33.364
For his body to heal itself.

31:33.480 --> 31:36.211
- Okay, what am I looking for?
-His heart.

31:45.240 --> 31:46.321
Help me!

31:55.360 --> 31:58.330
- Oh. Okay. I think I got it. Heart.
-Oh... Yeah.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.402
Can you feel a tear or rupture?

32:00.520 --> 32:03.285
Clamp down hard on his heart.
Try to slow the bleeding.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.926
- Grant. Drop the staff.
-Get away from me.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.446
- Agent Ward...
-This isn't you.

32:11.960 --> 32:13.007
Get back.

32:29.480 --> 32:31.005
- Help me!

32:32.200 --> 32:34.248
Please! Please!

32:42.280 --> 32:45.762
Grant! Help me!

32:46.640 --> 32:48.608
Grant, please!

32:49.440 --> 32:50.601
Help me!

32:54.480 --> 32:55.481
Grant!

32:56.720 --> 32:58.245
- Not yet, Grant.
-Help me!

32:58.320 --> 33:00.527
- But he's gonna...
-Not yet.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.887
Throw him the rope,
and I throw you in there, too.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.001
Please!

33:09.120 --> 33:10.531
Grant!

33:40.320 --> 33:42.800
Oh, my God, are you okay?
Come here.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.129
- Oh, you've got to be kidding.

33:53.960 --> 33:56.281
This time, let me help.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.560
Yeah. Come on.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.570
I am not afraid of you.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.045
Am I dead?

35:10.600 --> 35:11.761
Apparently not.

35:18.200 --> 35:23.161
You're easily the most beautiful thing
I've seen in a thousand years.

35:30.320 --> 35:32.766
Coulson did that?
He just shoved his hand inside?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.804
Well, he had to. I froze.
Didn't know what to do.

35:35.880 --> 35:36.961
Hey, you didn't freeze.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.611
You just weren't up for the idea
of putting your hand

35:39.680 --> 35:42.251
- inside somebody else's chest.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.291
Maybe I should jump in.

35:46.560 --> 35:47.607
Yeah.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.886
Hi, Dad.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.481
Yeah, it's great to hear your voice, too.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.564
I've been meaning to call you
for a couple of days.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.967
It's been a difficult few weeks.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.086
When you held it,

36:04.240 --> 36:05.924
did you see anything?

36:08.920 --> 36:10.285
Then how?

36:11.600 --> 36:13.728
How did you hold all three?

36:13.800 --> 36:15.962
Because I see it every day.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.569
I know that look.
You're tempted.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.482
Now, what is it you wanna see?

36:39.600 --> 36:41.090
You and I have a lot in common.

36:41.800 --> 36:44.121
We've both been stabbed in the heart.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.130
I was killed.

36:50.520 --> 36:53.444
Well, almost.
I'm hazy on that.

36:55.120 --> 36:58.681
Afterwards, it's kind of a blank.

37:00.000 --> 37:04.483
I have no memory of being revived,
of being in a hospital.

37:05.640 --> 37:07.881
Just woke up a few months later.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.327
And are you haunted by it,
Mr. Coulson?

37:12.000 --> 37:15.288
No.
Not exactly.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.044
Then what's the problem?

37:21.960 --> 37:23.325
I suppose you're right.

37:26.680 --> 37:29.251
Can we give you a lift back
to the university?

37:29.320 --> 37:30.731
Well, you know,

37:30.800 --> 37:33.883
with Europe's new fascination
with all things Asgardian,

37:34.840 --> 37:38.640
I'm wondering if it's time
to start over somewhere else.

37:38.720 --> 37:42.691
A nice beach?
A life of tropical drinks and massages?

37:42.760 --> 37:43.921
Mmm...

37:44.000 --> 37:45.764
Well, I'd get bored.

37:45.840 --> 37:49.686
You should consider the
American Northwest. Maybe Portland.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.800
Good food scene.
Great philharmonic.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.291
Well, if you will come and visit.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.727
It's not everyone
I get to share my stories with.

37:56.840 --> 37:57.841
Sure.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.729
And if Thor's in town,
I'll introduce you.

38:15.320 --> 38:16.481
Hey.

38:19.720 --> 38:23.441
I could get used to turndown service
and little mints on my pillow.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.489
Overnights aren't standard.

38:26.560 --> 38:28.289
We deserve a nice night.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.771
You especially.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.211
How are you feeling?

38:33.560 --> 38:34.891
Not great.

38:38.080 --> 38:41.163
I'm sorry.
For before.

38:41.240 --> 38:42.401
Um...

38:43.400 --> 38:45.164
I'm not that guy.

38:45.240 --> 38:49.609
You're a guy who saves lives.
I can overlook a little Hulk rage.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.250
No harm, no foul.

38:53.120 --> 38:56.283
Does everything just
roll off your back?

38:56.760 --> 38:57.886
No.

38:58.440 --> 39:01.649
If it helped, I'd rage all the time,
but it doesn't.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.289
What I saw,

39:09.280 --> 39:11.169
it was about my brother.

39:15.600 --> 39:17.443
I figured.

39:21.600 --> 39:25.491
I know you're not one to talk,
but like I said, I'm here.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.131
My shoulder's free.

39:34.960 --> 39:36.246
I'm beat.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.643
Another time maybe.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.362
Well, you know where I live.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.922
Did I fall asleep?

41:06.160 --> 41:09.050
For a little while, but, uh, that's good.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.402
It means you are relaxed.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.008
That's precisely how I'm feeling.

41:15.080 --> 41:16.730
Relaxed.

41:17.840 --> 41:21.686
Honestly, Tahiti's too good to be true.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.289
I know.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.964
It's a magical place.
