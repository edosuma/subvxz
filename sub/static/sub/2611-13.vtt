00:14.664 --> 00:16.916
Here, Max!
Come here, Max.

00:16.916 --> 00:17.917
Where are you, man?

00:24.090 --> 00:27.218
Maxie! Max.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.308
Max?

00:38.688 --> 00:39.772
Maxie!

00:42.024 --> 00:43.067
Rudy?

00:53.828 --> 00:54.871
Hey, Max ...

01:11.846 --> 01:12.930
Honey?

01:13.765 --> 01:14.807
Are you okay?

01:24.025 --> 01:25.109
Smell ammonia.

01:25.526 --> 01:27.737
Yep, and that's
the least of our problems.

01:27.737 --> 01:29.489
Anybody inside
died instantly.

01:29.489 --> 01:30.281
You were first on scene?

01:30.281 --> 01:31.657
Yes, sir.

01:31.657 --> 01:33.993
Wife passed out on the porch
trying to get to her husband.

01:33.993 --> 01:37.121
A neighbor saw her and called it in.
Paramedics have her now.

01:37.497 --> 01:38.706
So, he's still in there?

01:38.706 --> 01:39.957
I attempted entry ...

01:39.957 --> 01:41.876
... but you were
driven back by the fumes,

01:41.876 --> 01:43.544
because this is
a clan lab house.

01:43.544 --> 01:46.464
All those chemicals they
use in clandestine drug labs...

01:46.464 --> 01:47.882
there's no telling
what's all in there.

01:47.882 --> 01:49.008
Well, we'd better figure it out,

01:49.008 --> 01:51.636
and we'd better get it contained
before more people die.

02:28.673 --> 02:29.799
1x13 Bunk

03:24.369 --> 03:25.411
If we find the body ...

03:27.038 --> 03:28.831
we find the source.
Let's go this way.

04:05.660 --> 04:06.786
No pulse.

04:06.786 --> 04:10.081
We got foam around
the mouth, lack of pallor.

04:10.081 --> 04:12.792
Broken glass
adjacent to the body,

04:12.792 --> 04:14.669
obvious chemical residue ...

04:14.669 --> 04:15.712
I'll get a Drager.

04:25.722 --> 04:26.764
Wow.

04:27.432 --> 04:30.560
Nitric acid,
1,800 parts per million.

04:32.186 --> 04:32.687
H?

04:33.271 --> 04:34.313
I know.

04:34.897 --> 04:36.566
100 parts per million is fatal.

04:38.276 --> 04:39.861
Chemical residue,

04:39.861 --> 04:44.323
plus sunlight created fumes
in a closed environment...

04:46.200 --> 04:48.619
...slowly accumulating
deadly gas.

04:50.705 --> 04:52.832
Adell, can you hear me?

04:52.832 --> 04:53.875
Copy that, H.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.126
Okay, listen to me.

04:55.126 --> 04:57.545
We're going to evacuate
to a one block radius.

04:57.545 --> 04:58.796
This place can blow.

04:58.796 --> 04:59.672
I'm all over it.

04:59.672 --> 05:01.090
I've got to aerate this room,

05:01.090 --> 05:03.051
but it looks like there's
steel casing behind there.

05:03.051 --> 05:04.093
Be careful.

05:04.093 --> 05:06.512
One spark and we can go.

05:06.512 --> 05:08.848
All right, I'll get the
pilot light on the oven.

05:08.848 --> 05:11.684
The gas has been
shut off at the curb.

05:11.684 --> 05:13.394
Okay. K-packs.

05:13.394 --> 05:17.065
Until we separate out this
glass, Speed, nothing's safe.

05:41.631 --> 05:42.674
Carefully.

05:53.267 --> 05:54.310
Take it easy.

05:55.353 --> 05:56.729
Speed ... easy.

05:59.816 --> 06:00.858
Sorry.

06:11.119 --> 06:13.371
So this is Breckenhurst
Retirement Community.

06:13.996 --> 06:16.541
I'd never put my grandmother
in a place like this.

06:16.541 --> 06:18.835
When she dies, she's
going to be in my house,

06:18.835 --> 06:21.462
with our priest,
surrounded by family.

06:21.462 --> 06:23.089
Oh, not my grandma.

06:23.089 --> 06:25.800
I want every day for her
to be new year's eve --

06:25.800 --> 06:28.511
drinking mimosas,
giving old men a hard time.

06:29.262 --> 06:31.556
Yeah. Southern.

06:31.556 --> 06:32.724
Cuban.

06:33.766 --> 06:34.809
Detective.

06:35.643 --> 06:37.311
When I die,
I want to go in my sleep.

06:37.979 --> 06:40.773
Betty Rosen, 81.
Lived with her sister, Pearl.

06:42.066 --> 06:43.317
She's the one that found her.

06:45.278 --> 06:46.237
How bad is it?

06:47.613 --> 06:48.531
Massacre.

06:50.533 --> 06:51.576
Shall we?

07:33.368 --> 07:34.535
I'll take the one-to-ones.

08:11.656 --> 08:12.907
She really took a beating.

08:19.664 --> 08:22.792
Home invasion ...
sexual predator ...

08:25.378 --> 08:26.713
Maybe we've got a serial.

08:26.713 --> 08:27.714
Yeah.

08:30.008 --> 08:32.677
One cold-hearted bastard
to prey on the elderly.

08:34.636 --> 08:36.681
Oh! Don't give me that look,

08:36.681 --> 08:38.558
'cause it's written all
over your faces, too.

08:43.604 --> 08:44.647
All right ...

08:45.773 --> 08:46.816
all right.

08:58.786 --> 09:00.663
Skull is fractured.

09:00.663 --> 09:02.332
Probably blunt force trauma.

09:02.332 --> 09:04.125
I'll need to clean
her up to see more.

09:06.627 --> 09:09.756
Not how you planned to end your
golden years, is it, Betty?

09:14.427 --> 09:15.762
93 degrees.

09:17.221 --> 09:19.432
Puts her time
of death at about...

09:19.432 --> 09:20.475
2:00 A.M.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.394
Blood pools indicate time
of attack was earlier.

09:23.895 --> 09:26.814
Your job, honey.
Mine begins with death.

10:33.631 --> 10:36.551
Isolated paper
in a pool of blood?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.470
It must be important to somebody.

11:05.163 --> 11:06.497
Three parts per million.

11:07.874 --> 11:10.585
We're clear-- okay, so,
we're on a code four.

11:10.585 --> 11:12.462
Let's send the M.E.'S
people in, all right?

11:12.462 --> 11:13.504
You got it.

11:18.468 --> 11:20.178
Crisis averted.

11:20.178 --> 11:21.596
Tell that to his widow.

11:22.347 --> 11:25.433
Okay, so we got to find something
that leads us to this cook, right?

11:25.433 --> 11:28.644
Yes, we do.
So, if I'm the cook,

11:28.644 --> 11:30.730
what do I need
to do to do my job?

11:31.105 --> 11:32.732
You need goggles,

11:33.941 --> 11:34.984
a mask ...

11:35.526 --> 11:37.320
... And latex gloves.

11:37.737 --> 11:38.988
Let's have a look at that.

11:44.369 --> 11:47.288
Bag it, tag it, and let's
see what else is here.

11:49.666 --> 11:51.751
I found the landlord,
a James Welmont.

11:51.751 --> 11:53.544
He said he'll
meet us at CSI.

11:53.544 --> 11:55.129
Okay, keep me posted.
Yeah.

11:55.129 --> 11:56.381
All right, we'll talk later.

11:56.381 --> 11:57.548
I'll see you back there.

11:59.634 --> 12:01.886
I don't own
the house by myself.

12:01.886 --> 12:04.597
I invest in property
with a group of doctors.

12:05.139 --> 12:06.849
"Diamond sun properties."

12:06.849 --> 12:09.060
When you say doctors,
do you mean surgeons?

12:09.060 --> 12:12.522
Well, we're dermatologists.
There are three of us.

12:12.522 --> 12:15.650
My partner just removed a carcinoma
from my back, as a matter of fact.

12:16.234 --> 12:19.112
As a dermatologist,
do you use latex gloves?

12:19.112 --> 12:20.530
Yeah, all the time.

12:20.530 --> 12:22.740
Mind if I take a look
around your practice?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.033
You be my guest.

12:24.033 --> 12:27.245
When was the last time the
house on mangrove was rented?

12:27.245 --> 12:30.498
I believe that house has
been vacant for six months.

12:30.498 --> 12:31.666
Renters skipped out on us.

12:31.666 --> 12:33.126
It's right there in
the records I brought for you.

12:33.126 --> 12:34.961
Yes, I've been
taking a look at these,

12:34.961 --> 12:38.089
and the rent seemed
very cheap for this part of town.

12:38.089 --> 12:41.092
Well, I don't make money
if the houses are unoccupied.

12:41.092 --> 12:44.220
This one was occupied, though,
wasn't it? A man died in it.

12:46.097 --> 12:48.182
Well, I can't help what
tenants do in my houses,

12:48.182 --> 12:51.436
just like I can't help what happens
in my houses when tenants leave.

12:51.978 --> 12:53.646
I mean, it's an investment.

12:53.646 --> 12:54.772
Yes.

12:54.772 --> 12:57.275
Usually with an investment
of this size, though,

12:58.317 --> 13:00.486
people take care
of them, don't they?

13:01.821 --> 13:04.115
All right.
You got me.

13:05.033 --> 13:07.618
I am guilty of not taking
care of my investment.

13:07.618 --> 13:10.079
And possibly,
negligent homicide.

13:12.165 --> 13:12.957
You arresting me?

13:12.957 --> 13:14.292
Not yet.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.754
Okay. Next time,
I bring my lawyer.

13:17.754 --> 13:19.213
Next time ...

13:19.213 --> 13:20.465
you may need one.

13:21.215 --> 13:23.343
Extent of the ecchymosis suggests...

13:23.343 --> 13:25.845
she lived several hours after
she sustained her injuries.

13:26.429 --> 13:28.556
Confirmed blunt force trauma,

13:28.556 --> 13:30.641
skull fracture,
subdural hematoma.

13:31.225 --> 13:33.353
No clear weapon;
could have been anything.

13:33.353 --> 13:36.481
Tox report indicates
therapeutic level of coumadin.

13:36.481 --> 13:37.857
Coumadin?

13:37.857 --> 13:39.067
Blood thinner.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.361
That could explain
the excessive blood loss.

13:41.903 --> 13:44.155
Was she on
any other medication?

13:44.155 --> 13:45.281
No.

13:45.281 --> 13:48.409
Right arm and
both hands are broken.

13:48.409 --> 13:50.411
Poor thing,
she tried to fight him off.

13:50.411 --> 13:52.205
81-year-old woman --

13:52.205 --> 13:53.873
doesn't take much
to break her bones.

13:55.416 --> 13:58.544
Tissue sections confirmed
neurofibrillary tangles.

14:01.881 --> 14:02.965
She had Alzheimer's.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.301
Late stages.

14:06.344 --> 14:07.887
Any physical findings?

14:08.638 --> 14:11.599
Diagnosing rape in
older females is tricky.

14:11.599 --> 14:14.602
Muscles have atrophied,
skin is less elastic.

14:14.602 --> 14:16.688
I'll collect a sexual assault kit.

14:35.373 --> 14:36.708
Hey.

14:36.708 --> 14:39.919
Hey. How'd the post
go on Mr. Caldwell?

14:39.919 --> 14:44.007
Death by asphyxiation
due to nitric acid fumes.

14:45.299 --> 14:49.178
The question becomes:
What was the nitric acid used for?

14:49.679 --> 14:52.181
I got to tell you, I'm having
a lot of trouble with this.

14:52.473 --> 14:53.516
Well, hang in there.

15:00.606 --> 15:02.150
Sulfuric acid.

15:06.904 --> 15:08.990
Sulfuric acid.

15:10.283 --> 15:15.496
We've got H-2-S-O-4, right?

15:16.414 --> 15:19.250
I got something in the
amphetamine family here.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.878
I don't know, uh,
MDA, maybe meth.

15:22.128 --> 15:24.172
But this doesn't compute, does it?

15:24.797 --> 15:26.132
Now you know
what I've been doing.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.677
These aren't components
of any drug I know.

15:31.804 --> 15:36.100
But they should give us
the final product. "M-d-p-2-P."

15:36.100 --> 15:39.228
"Methylene-dioxy-
phenyl-2-propanone."

15:39.228 --> 15:42.482
It's not really a recreational
drug. It's not really anything.

15:42.482 --> 15:44.984
Maybe that means
he didn't mean to make it.

15:45.777 --> 15:47.320
Go with me here
for a second, Speed.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.239
Now, if you sub in
formic acid for nitric acid ...

15:51.532 --> 15:53.034
you get ecstasy, don't you?

15:53.034 --> 15:54.577
The cook screwed up.
Right.

15:54.577 --> 15:56.371
But because the
pills were white,

15:56.371 --> 15:58.206
he figured he could still
sell them as X.

15:58.206 --> 16:00.500
So he replaces one ingredient...

16:00.500 --> 16:02.877
along the chemical pathway
to try to make something legal.

16:02.877 --> 16:05.380
Yes, he did, and ended up
making a chemical...

16:05.380 --> 16:07.882
so powerful that its fumes
could kill human beings.

16:07.882 --> 16:10.301
So what are we chasing,
the fumes or the pills?

16:10.301 --> 16:12.053
We're chasing the cook.

16:25.603 --> 16:28.732
I'm so sorry about your
sister, Mrs. Abrams.

16:29.691 --> 16:31.609
Uh, you and Betty
lived together?

16:31.609 --> 16:34.195
Yes. We take
care of each other.

16:34.612 --> 16:36.322
But the night she died ...

16:36.948 --> 16:40.118
I was in Coral Gables
with friends.

16:40.118 --> 16:42.829
It got late.
I can't drive at night.

16:44.164 --> 16:47.417
I told her I didn't want to go.
She said:

16:48.460 --> 16:51.171
"go out, have some fun."

16:52.922 --> 16:55.842
Can you think of anyone who
would want to hurt Betty?

16:56.259 --> 16:57.886
Oh, no.

16:58.720 --> 17:01.389
She was voted the most popular.

17:01.389 --> 17:06.603
Everyone loves her,
especially the men.

17:07.561 --> 17:10.357
You look a lot like her.

17:10.357 --> 17:14.819
She loved to wear her
hair long down her back.

17:15.444 --> 17:16.905
Just like you.

17:17.781 --> 17:20.450
Did anybody know she
was alone that night?

17:20.450 --> 17:25.454
Everybody. Betty never
could keep a secret.

17:30.377 --> 17:33.088
Sorry I'm late. I got
jammed up on the causeway.

17:33.088 --> 17:35.340
No worries.
Pam again?

17:35.340 --> 17:36.466
Yeah, how'd you know?

17:36.466 --> 17:38.927
You got the same clothes
on you had yesterday.

17:41.012 --> 17:43.223
Uh, so is that glass
from the clan house?

17:43.223 --> 17:44.307
Yep.
Any hits?

17:44.307 --> 17:45.225
No hits,

17:45.225 --> 17:46.351
but I'm about to superglue...

17:46.351 --> 17:47.852
the discarded glove
unless you want to do it.

17:47.852 --> 17:48.978
Yeah, I'll do it.

17:48.978 --> 17:50.230
Go ahead.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.107
Powdered latex.

17:52.107 --> 17:54.067
The easy slide on and off.

17:56.361 --> 17:59.114
So they have, uh, powdered gloves
when you were coming up?

17:59.114 --> 18:02.117
No powdered gloves,
no cell phones, no DNA.

18:02.534 --> 18:03.326
No cell phones?

18:03.326 --> 18:04.369
No cell phones.

18:11.459 --> 18:12.502
We have a winner.

18:17.257 --> 18:18.591
AFIS?
AFIS.

18:22.262 --> 18:23.722
I can tell you who it won't be.

18:24.889 --> 18:25.932
Go ahead.

18:26.558 --> 18:28.893
Dermo doctor uses
powder-free gloves.

18:28.893 --> 18:30.729
It's a different company
than our discard...

18:30.729 --> 18:32.605
and they buy by the case.
Bulk.

18:33.231 --> 18:35.108
Then why do I like
this guy so much?

18:37.068 --> 18:39.195
AFIS seems to like
someone else.

18:40.447 --> 18:42.741
"Gregory Kimble."
Now who is this?

18:42.741 --> 18:44.284
Let's go find out.

18:45.952 --> 18:49.289
Mr. Kimble, let's talk about the
trash drugs you've been cooking.

18:50.957 --> 18:51.958
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:52.584 --> 18:55.503
No? Little house over on
Mangrove doesn't ring a bell?

18:55.795 --> 18:56.880
Nope.

18:57.297 --> 18:58.965
"Nope."
Okay.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.760
Well, the problem is, is we recovered
your fingerprint over there.

19:02.052 --> 19:04.429
I party a lot. I might've
ended up there one night.

19:04.429 --> 19:06.931
Okay, fair enough.
You wear sunscreen?

19:06.931 --> 19:08.933
Everyone in Miami does.
Why?

19:08.933 --> 19:12.187
Well, you have some very interesting
burn damage around your mouth...

19:12.187 --> 19:13.229
and under your nose.

19:13.229 --> 19:15.440
Sometimes that can be
from a chemical burn, right?

19:15.440 --> 19:16.483
You bet.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.161
You're my cook, aren't you?

19:28.161 --> 19:29.371
Cook?

19:30.622 --> 19:32.916
What are you talking about?
I'm a part-time student.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.043
Really?
You got a job?

19:35.043 --> 19:36.461
Not right now.

19:36.461 --> 19:37.921
Well, DMV records show...

19:37.921 --> 19:40.632
that you drive around in a
brand-new convertible Lex.

19:41.466 --> 19:43.009
Why don't you do
yourself a favor...

19:43.009 --> 19:46.137
and tell us who's selling this
stuff once you put it into pill form?

19:47.514 --> 19:49.015
I think I want my attorney.

19:49.015 --> 19:50.642
After we process you.

19:50.642 --> 19:52.394
I'm going to need
your clothes, too.

19:54.270 --> 19:55.271
What am I going to wear?

19:59.442 --> 20:00.527
Laura.

20:01.361 --> 20:03.029
It's been a while.
Welcome back.

20:03.029 --> 20:06.199
Well, a year at Quantico is enough.
Can't take that weather.

20:06.199 --> 20:08.118
Hmm, how was the nightlife?

20:08.118 --> 20:11.830
Government compound,
95% male. Hurt me.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.750
I'll bet it did.
Anything on my victim?

20:15.750 --> 20:18.253
Well, the sexual
assault kit was positive.

20:18.253 --> 20:19.838
Semen was aspermic.

20:19.838 --> 20:21.339
So, no little soldiers?

20:21.339 --> 20:23.174
No, the guy probably
had a vasectomy.

20:23.174 --> 20:26.177
P30 indicates
recent intercourse.

20:26.177 --> 20:27.554
How recent?

20:27.554 --> 20:28.596
Eight to twelve hours.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.515
That's consistent
with time of death.

20:30.515 --> 20:32.559
Well, I'll run the
DNA through CODIS.

20:32.892 --> 20:34.102
Thank you.

20:35.353 --> 20:36.438
Hey, Calleigh.

20:36.438 --> 20:39.399
Crime at the condo
is virtually nonexistent.

20:39.399 --> 20:41.526
They've had two burglaries
in the past five years.

20:41.526 --> 20:43.236
The place prides itself on safety.

20:43.236 --> 20:44.863
Well, that eliminates the amateurs.

20:44.863 --> 20:45.613
That's right. So...

20:45.613 --> 20:47.907
I ran the names of
registered sex offenders...

20:47.907 --> 20:49.951
within a three-mile
radius of the complex.

20:49.951 --> 20:50.994
Name popped up.

20:51.286 --> 20:53.788
"Keith Sewell.
On parole for rape."

20:53.788 --> 20:54.581
Guess where he works?

20:55.665 --> 20:56.708
Gardener.

20:57.083 --> 20:59.461
You haul me in 'cause
my prints were on the window?

20:59.461 --> 21:00.462
Talk to the manager.

21:00.462 --> 21:02.297
She has me change that
glass couple times a month.

21:02.297 --> 21:03.882
And she has
you do that, why?

21:04.382 --> 21:07.010
Mrs. Rosen liked to break it.

21:07.010 --> 21:08.595
Of course she was a little ...

21:08.595 --> 21:10.138
light in the head,
if you know what I mean.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.765
She suffered from Alzheimer's.

21:11.765 --> 21:15.226
Yeah, she told me, uh,
her parents wouldn't let her date.

21:15.226 --> 21:17.937
So she had to sneak out
to meet her boyfriend.

21:17.937 --> 21:19.356
And for the record ...

21:21.149 --> 21:23.318
I don't do old women.

21:25.236 --> 21:26.988
Nothing over 25.

21:28.114 --> 21:30.283
A convicted rapist with standards.

21:32.702 --> 21:36.414
Mr. Sewell, have you ever
had a vasectomy?

21:36.414 --> 21:37.957
No one's snipping on me.

21:37.957 --> 21:39.668
We can get a court
order to verify.

21:39.668 --> 21:41.002
I'll verify right now.

21:41.002 --> 21:42.420
Hey! Sit down!

21:45.215 --> 21:47.300
A mouth swab will suffice ...

21:48.093 --> 21:49.135
for now.

21:50.970 --> 21:52.597
An XRF.

21:52.597 --> 21:55.225
This thing's got to be 250 grand.
When did we get this?

21:55.225 --> 21:58.395
We got it this morning.
Courtesy of the ATF.

21:59.354 --> 22:00.397
Nice.

22:02.107 --> 22:07.320
So, the X-Ray allows us to examine
Greg Kimble's shirt for chemicals.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.072
Exactly right.

22:09.072 --> 22:11.574
And zero in on areas that
we can then extract from.

22:11.866 --> 22:13.868
Now, Mr. Kimble
claims he has no job

22:13.868 --> 22:16.663
and no legitimate access
to chemicals, right?

22:16.663 --> 22:18.373
So if we find chemicals
on his clothing,

22:18.373 --> 22:19.958
we can link him
to the drug lab.

22:20.291 --> 22:23.461
But didn't we already do that
with the print in the glove?

22:23.461 --> 22:25.797
Yes, we did.
But like my old man says:

22:25.797 --> 22:28.925
"you don't have a backup,
you don't have a plan."

22:30.093 --> 22:31.094
Smart guy.

22:31.094 --> 22:32.846
Okay.
Here you go.

22:34.055 --> 22:35.223
Look at this.

22:35.223 --> 22:39.394
High amounts of carbon,
nitrogen and phosphorus.

22:39.394 --> 22:42.105
Components found in our
chemical residue at the clan house.

22:42.105 --> 22:44.649
That's right. And it makes
Mr. Kimble a what?

22:44.649 --> 22:45.608
A liar.

22:45.608 --> 22:46.860
A liar.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.487
When mass spec confirms this,
let me know, will you?

22:49.487 --> 22:52.407
Will do. I'll call you
on your "cell phone".

22:55.577 --> 22:57.495
Adell, w-wait a second.
Wait a second.

22:57.495 --> 22:58.538
What is going on here?

22:59.372 --> 23:01.124
States Attorney cut him loose.

23:01.124 --> 23:02.083
Did he say why?

23:02.083 --> 23:03.126
Absolutely not.

23:03.126 --> 23:05.003
Okay. Where is the States
Attorney right now?

23:05.003 --> 23:06.046
He's up in your office.

23:06.046 --> 23:09.090
In my office.
He stays put until I say so.

23:09.632 --> 23:12.969
Dante, I've got this guy
dead to his rights.

23:13.803 --> 23:14.721
He's my cook.

23:14.721 --> 23:18.016
Where? You can't place him
at the lab at the Mangrove house.

23:18.016 --> 23:21.353
Of course I can. I recovered his
fingerprint there in a latex glove.

23:21.353 --> 23:22.645
At a party house.

23:23.313 --> 23:24.439
That only proves
he was there.

23:24.439 --> 23:26.608
Wearing latex gloves.

23:26.608 --> 23:29.861
The fumes from this man's
trash already killed somebody.

23:29.861 --> 23:31.571
He may be selling lethal pills.

23:31.571 --> 23:34.741
You know that Florida
statute 893.03...

23:34.741 --> 23:38.411
has a specific list of
controlled substances.

23:38.411 --> 23:42.332
Even if we could put him there,
he wasn't making anything illegal.

23:42.749 --> 23:45.460
Okay, so, you get
to turn him loose...

23:45.460 --> 23:47.796
and I get to send the victim's
wife a sympathy card.

23:47.796 --> 23:49.381
Talk about your déja vu.

23:51.216 --> 23:52.759
Your brother was a good cop.

23:53.551 --> 23:55.595
This has nothing to do with him.

23:58.098 --> 23:59.557
Interesting that you
bring him up.

24:00.183 --> 24:01.518
You need to let
this go, Horatio.

24:01.518 --> 24:04.312
Why? Why do I
need to let this go?

24:05.355 --> 24:07.440
It's in the best interest
of this case.

24:08.775 --> 24:10.360
And in my
best interest, too?

24:11.194 --> 24:12.278
Is that what you're saying?

24:13.488 --> 24:15.156
Those are your words ...

24:15.156 --> 24:16.199
not mine.

24:17.742 --> 24:18.785
Let it go.

24:25.524 --> 24:26.316
Speed.

24:26.316 --> 24:27.526
Hey, what's up?
You wanted to see me?

24:27.526 --> 24:30.278
Yeah, I do. I want to take a
look at this doctor again, okay?

24:30.278 --> 24:32.781
Yeah, you know what?
I got in early this morning, and, uh

24:32.781 --> 24:34.533
... check out his
real estate holdings.

24:35.742 --> 24:39.037
Welmont and his partner own a
dozen homes in those neighborhoods.

24:39.037 --> 24:42.249
Dangerous neighborhoods,
landlocked, near freeways...

24:42.249 --> 24:43.291
under the radar.

24:43.291 --> 24:46.086
Yup. And I talked
to a guy from DEA.

24:46.086 --> 24:48.463
Says a clan lab can make,
like, 500 grand cash.

24:48.463 --> 24:49.923
And you can
times that by twelve.

24:49.923 --> 24:52.217
I doubt he's even seeing
patients anymore. Nice going.

24:52.884 --> 24:53.927
Adell?

24:53.927 --> 24:54.803
Yeah?

24:54.803 --> 24:56.263
Adell, Horatio.
Road trip.

25:08.775 --> 25:10.402
Setting up shop again, Greg?

25:13.405 --> 25:14.656
Check the van, Speed.

25:17.659 --> 25:19.578
So, we've got
a new location.

25:21.663 --> 25:25.751
We got some lye,
ammonia, some methanol.

25:26.585 --> 25:29.713
And ...
a new formula, huh?

25:30.672 --> 25:32.549
I guess one death in the
neighborhood is enough.

25:32.549 --> 25:34.843
If you hang tight, I'll get
you a warrant for that stuff.

25:35.385 --> 25:38.346
Uh, it's not against the law
to have those chemicals.

25:39.598 --> 25:40.640
No, it's not.

25:42.059 --> 25:44.978
Really brilliant operation
Dr. Welmont has going on here.

25:45.604 --> 25:48.273
He provides the house,
the chemicals and the recipe.

25:48.273 --> 25:50.901
He pays off a couple of
cooks like you with lux cars.

25:50.901 --> 25:53.320
That's peanuts to the
guys who sling the pills.

25:53.320 --> 25:57.908
Pills so unusual there's not a law
against it, but at the end of the day,

25:57.908 --> 26:01.244
he and his partners
split about six million bucks.

26:02.496 --> 26:03.580
It's not six million.

26:03.580 --> 26:07.000
This is where you say,
"I don't know any Dr. Welmont."

26:09.544 --> 26:10.587
Yeah.

26:12.547 --> 26:13.590
Right.

26:14.758 --> 26:15.634
What do you got?

26:15.634 --> 26:17.260
That was the Medical Examiner.

26:17.761 --> 26:21.223
Just picked up a 19-year-old kid.
Overdosed on "E."

26:26.186 --> 26:27.354
Nineteen years old.

26:28.522 --> 26:29.564
Nice going.

26:33.110 --> 26:34.778
That's right, you guys,
feel the music.

26:35.654 --> 26:38.782
We're all Britney Spears at
heart. Feel the music.

26:39.574 --> 26:41.827
Sewell lied on his application,

26:41.827 --> 26:43.787
but he didn't lie
about the window.

26:44.538 --> 26:47.666
Now, Betty had some good days,
and she had some bad days.

26:47.666 --> 26:48.792
Her memory, you know.

26:48.792 --> 26:51.586
Yeah, we heard that she
thought she had a boyfriend.

26:51.586 --> 26:54.423
Boyfriend?
Try boyfriends.

26:54.423 --> 26:58.635
This place is high school with
arthritis. And Betty was hot stuff.

26:58.635 --> 27:00.554
So, can you point out
these boyfriends?

27:00.554 --> 27:03.098
Betty was a very private person.

27:03.098 --> 27:05.684
It's okay, I think we'll, uh,
we'll round them all up.

27:06.017 --> 27:07.644
Betty was a lot of fun.

27:07.644 --> 27:11.690
She and I had a very
healthy sexual relationship.

27:11.690 --> 27:14.818
She was not afraid
to try new things.

27:15.610 --> 27:17.195
Back to the question, Mr. Rines.

27:17.195 --> 27:20.949
Yeah, no, um,
I saw her last night.

27:20.949 --> 27:23.160
Uh, left her place about 9:00.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.453
Can anyone verify that?

27:25.495 --> 27:28.415
Yes, Mrs. Meyers
was walking her dog.

27:30.500 --> 27:35.505
Don't tell anyone I told you,
but I hear Betty was loaded.

27:35.505 --> 27:37.674
She married one of those
Wall Street types ...

27:37.674 --> 27:39.593
back when the market
meant something.

27:39.593 --> 27:42.095
Now?
We're all in the toilet.

27:42.095 --> 27:46.558
Anyway, I think Pearl was
counting on Betty's dough.

27:46.558 --> 27:50.604
Rumor has it,
she left it all to one guy.

27:50.979 --> 27:52.064
Who?

27:54.775 --> 27:55.901
I don't know.

27:57.152 --> 27:59.446
We're almost finished,
Mr. Gaines.

28:00.655 --> 28:02.616
Did you see Betty Rosen
the night she died?

28:02.616 --> 28:06.161
Oh, no. She dumped me
three weeks ago.

28:06.161 --> 28:09.748
Said she needed somebody
more adventurous, you know?

28:09.748 --> 28:12.459
At first I thought she got me
confused with Herb Rines.

28:16.379 --> 28:20.550
Me -- I like to go for coffee,
talk, you know?

28:21.593 --> 28:23.136
She wasn't going for it.

28:24.429 --> 28:27.891
Mr. Gaines, do you have any
ice plant outside your home?

28:28.225 --> 28:31.853
No. I'm not one
for succulents.

28:32.562 --> 28:33.605
Well ...

28:34.147 --> 28:36.441
if that's the case ...

28:40.570 --> 28:41.822
... This may be a problem.

28:45.867 --> 28:47.953
I'm going to need a DNA sample.

28:50.872 --> 28:52.416
Better circumstances, Alexx?

28:52.416 --> 28:56.002
You got that right, Horatio.
Nineteen years young.

28:57.254 --> 29:00.799
Detective said he just got accepted
into Vanderbilt busy school ...

29:00.799 --> 29:02.259
working toward
a pilot license.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.595
Flew solo for the
first time yesterday.

29:06.304 --> 29:07.764
Went out to celebrate
with friends.

29:07.764 --> 29:10.267
They say he
took one tab of "E."

29:10.267 --> 29:12.436
When he didn't get high,
took a handful.

29:12.436 --> 29:15.355
Collapsed at a club called Fate.

29:15.355 --> 29:16.815
... and the devil laughed.

29:17.357 --> 29:20.902
So, stomach contents.
Figured you'd want to be here.

29:23.864 --> 29:27.325
Analysis will determine
if it's mdp2p.

29:27.325 --> 29:30.370
I guess I'm hoping that one or
two of the pills didn't dissolve ...

29:30.370 --> 29:32.247
before he expired.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.583
You're hoping for a stamp?

29:34.583 --> 29:35.959
Call me crazy.

29:36.501 --> 29:37.544
All right.

29:48.805 --> 29:50.098
Stamp familiar?

29:51.141 --> 29:55.395
"Please allow me to introduce myself."
Nice going.

29:56.313 --> 29:59.024
If we found a pill with Welmont's
company stamp on it,

29:59.024 --> 30:00.150
why are we going
to see the cook again?

30:00.150 --> 30:02.486
Because he's weak.
Welmont is the target,

30:02.486 --> 30:04.988
but Kimble is our
ammunition.

30:05.864 --> 30:08.325
So much gossip
coming out of that complex,

30:08.325 --> 30:09.451
I don't know
what the truth is.

30:09.451 --> 30:14.664
Well, Carrillo confirmed Sewell's alibi,
so our sex offender's out as a suspect.

30:15.332 --> 30:17.959
And these guys gave up
their clothes way too easily.

30:17.959 --> 30:19.544
Yeah, that's never good.

30:19.544 --> 30:21.838
I don't know, I mean, you saw
the blood in the condo.

30:21.838 --> 30:24.549
There is no way a killer got out
of there without getting bloody.

30:24.549 --> 30:26.468
And Carrillo confirmed
with Mrs. Meyers...

30:26.468 --> 30:29.346
that Herb Rines left Betty's
place at around nine.

30:29.346 --> 30:30.722
She didn't see a
drop of blood on him.

30:30.722 --> 30:33.350
And the DNA on the
semen matches Herb.

30:33.350 --> 30:35.644
Which confirms his story.

30:37.437 --> 30:40.857
I don't know. Maybe someone
saw Betty after Herb left.

30:40.857 --> 30:41.691
I don't know.

30:41.691 --> 30:44.277
But then Marty has ice plant
wedged in the sole of his shoe,

30:44.277 --> 30:46.655
so he doesn't have time
to clean it, yet it's km negative.

30:46.655 --> 30:48.532
I can't believe this.

30:49.241 --> 30:50.283
It's a dead end.

30:54.538 --> 30:55.580
Not quite.

31:55.807 --> 32:00.437
"This is to inform you the codicil to your
will has been completed and signed

32:00.437 --> 32:04.066
and is effective as
of November 4, 2002."

32:05.525 --> 32:08.695
Leo Kling was right.
Betty changed her will.

32:08.695 --> 32:11.156
But Pearl Abrams
did not kill her sister.

32:11.156 --> 32:12.616
Yeah, well, somebody did.

32:14.284 --> 32:16.244
Kimble, Miami-Dade.
Come on out.

32:20.749 --> 32:21.833
It's locked.

32:23.919 --> 32:24.961
Wait a minute.

32:34.971 --> 32:36.014
This is fresh.

32:36.807 --> 32:38.600
Paging Dr. Welmont.

32:47.266 --> 32:49.643
Cluster wounds.
Right on the money.

32:52.563 --> 32:54.147
He didn't even have
time to fight back.

32:54.147 --> 32:57.484
That's right, because he was sitting
with somebody he trusted, wasn't he?

32:57.484 --> 32:58.527
You know what,
get the Bullard.

33:02.272 --> 33:05.525
Body heat.
Passenger side.

33:05.525 --> 33:08.653
It's fading, but it's still evident.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.864
93 degrees.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.616
Murder was just here.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.701
Now show me the legs.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.665
Braced himself for the stabbing.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.213
Got the outline of a back.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.131
Probably used it for leverage.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.217
Wait a minute.

33:32.552 --> 33:33.595
I got a disruption.

33:35.263 --> 33:36.556
What the hell is that?

33:38.642 --> 33:39.434
You know what?

33:39.434 --> 33:41.603
I'm going to get this back to the
AV Lab and try to enhance it.

33:41.937 --> 33:42.938
Do that.

33:46.066 --> 33:48.235
When you've eliminated
all the suspects...

33:48.235 --> 33:50.028
and the evidence
doesn't make sense,

33:50.028 --> 33:52.656
it's just nice
to put it in context.

33:53.573 --> 33:55.867
We know all of this
blood is Betty Rosen's.

33:58.954 --> 34:02.666
So we reevaluate the "how"
to get us to the "who."

34:03.500 --> 34:04.584
It's a lot of spatter.

34:04.584 --> 34:05.961
We don't have
to string every drop.

34:05.961 --> 34:08.255
I know, just enough to
determine the point of origin.

34:52.007 --> 34:53.050
Let's walk it.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.552
Yeah.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.473
Well, spatter starts high.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.434
Consistent with the
beginning of the attack...

35:02.434 --> 35:04.394
blunt force object,
the countertop.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.856
Right, now,
if she turned and fell...

35:08.774 --> 35:12.402
laying here for a while where
she created this blood pool.

35:20.118 --> 35:24.289
At some point she got up,
moved down the hallway ...

35:27.042 --> 35:28.085
... to here.

35:29.461 --> 35:32.589
Another blow area.
Blood smears here.

35:40.013 --> 35:42.099
There's another spatter
pattern here on the table ...

35:43.725 --> 35:45.811
where, again
she fell to the ground.

35:46.395 --> 35:47.854
Making another pool of blood.

35:54.945 --> 36:00.158
The spatter in this room
radiates in a complete circle.

36:03.495 --> 36:06.540
Leaving no space for anyone
else to be in the room.

36:19.845 --> 36:23.181
All this blood,
unable to move, I guess.

36:24.766 --> 36:26.143
She laid there until she died.

36:29.396 --> 36:33.859
Well, the stabber was definitely
in the seat next to Greg Kimble.

36:33.859 --> 36:37.988
It's only a three degree difference
in temperature between the two.

36:37.988 --> 36:41.116
My only problem is that disruption.
I don't know why it's there.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.869
Something seems to be
impeding the heat absorption.

36:43.869 --> 36:45.120
Zoom in on it again.

36:53.420 --> 36:54.212
Is that a ...

36:54.212 --> 36:56.506
That's a carcinoma.

37:12.189 --> 37:15.067
And we've got a match.
Good.

37:16.610 --> 37:19.071
Catching your cancer,
Dr. Welmont,

37:19.071 --> 37:20.947
has become your undoing.

37:22.532 --> 37:23.325
What is this?

37:24.034 --> 37:27.662
This is a thermal image that places
your client in the murder vehicle.

37:28.705 --> 37:29.748
High tech.

37:30.874 --> 37:33.960
He saw an injured man
at one of his properties,

37:33.960 --> 37:35.003
tried to revive him.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.589
That's cute,
that's one for my book.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.132
Mm-hmm, me, too.

37:39.132 --> 37:43.512
And the pill that killed a 19-year-old
boy has his company logo on it.

37:46.223 --> 37:50.310
Diamond sun symbol's as
prevalent as "hang ten" in Miami.

37:51.019 --> 37:54.731
Besides, none of this ties
Dr. Welmont to this homicide.

37:54.731 --> 37:56.566
How about his knife?

37:56.566 --> 37:58.527
We know he carries
one for protection.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.446
He travels into some fairly
dangerous neighborhoods...

38:01.446 --> 38:02.698
to visit his properties.

38:02.948 --> 38:05.659
Did you bring your knife
or did you lose it?

38:15.669 --> 38:19.005
Dr. Welmont is doing everything
he can to cooperate in this matter.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.676
How commendable.

38:27.514 --> 38:29.057
I don't believe this
smooth operator...

38:29.057 --> 38:30.934
would hand over a knife
with traces of blood on it.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.602
I'm not interested in the blood.
Speed.

38:33.186 --> 38:36.231
Digital pictures, every angle,
and get them to me.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.357
You got it.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.111
An accident?
How can that be?

38:41.528 --> 38:43.280
We're so sorry, Pearl.

38:44.448 --> 38:47.409
Pearl, um, may we ask
you about Betty's will?

38:48.035 --> 38:49.077
What will?

38:49.077 --> 38:50.537
Betty changed her will...

38:50.537 --> 38:52.914
and set up a trust commencing
at the time of her death.

38:52.914 --> 38:54.458
For whom?

38:54.458 --> 38:55.709
For you.

38:56.918 --> 38:58.670
Well, you'll be well
cared for now.

38:58.670 --> 39:03.008
She always did take care of me.
I'm the youngest.

39:06.303 --> 39:08.930
You look a lot like her.

39:08.930 --> 39:12.893
She loved wearing her
hair down her back,

39:12.893 --> 39:14.978
just like you.

39:57.479 --> 40:00.273
Okay, now, here we go.
Let's highlight the hilt.

40:03.527 --> 40:06.655
Good. Now highlight the bruises
on each side of the wound.

40:10.826 --> 40:14.996
Excellent. Now, drag the
hilt over to the wound.

40:19.710 --> 40:20.877
Nice work.

40:21.294 --> 40:24.256
Okay, what am I looking at?

40:24.256 --> 40:26.383
This is the hilt from your knife.

40:26.383 --> 40:28.343
It marked every wound.

40:28.343 --> 40:32.222
Cluster stabs up close,
fast and furious.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.265
You're not shy, are you?

40:35.517 --> 40:37.769
I swear I'm never going
to tell these guys a thing.

40:39.020 --> 40:40.063
I know.

40:47.487 --> 40:48.530
Here's the irony.

40:49.239 --> 40:53.160
Had you not been kind enough to
provide me with the murder weapon...

40:53.160 --> 40:56.121
I would have been stuck with
negligent homicide for the neighbor.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.582
But as it stands now,

40:58.582 --> 41:00.751
I can charge you with murder.

41:00.751 --> 41:04.504
And I haven't even gotten
to the 19 year old who OD'd.

41:05.422 --> 41:06.548
So what are you saying?

41:06.965 --> 41:09.676
I'm just saying, thanks.

41:29.738 --> 41:30.781
Hey.

41:31.740 --> 41:34.743
Forgot to get your signature
on the evidence release card.

41:35.994 --> 41:38.580
For the X pill in our
nineteen year old.

41:38.580 --> 41:39.790
You got me.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.583
Heard you nailed the bad guy.

41:43.043 --> 41:44.086
That we did.

41:45.128 --> 41:46.505
I guess timing is everything.

41:49.216 --> 41:51.093
All right, wait a minute.

41:52.511 --> 41:53.970
You're still unsettled.

41:58.141 --> 42:00.227
This isn't about our victim, is it?

42:03.438 --> 42:05.232
You know, Alexx,

42:05.232 --> 42:06.775
for me it is about the victims.

42:09.820 --> 42:15.033
Especially the ones who die
too young, too soon. You know?

42:19.121 --> 42:21.957
But as always,
good work.
