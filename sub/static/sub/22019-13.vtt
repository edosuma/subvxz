WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.526
MAN: LET'S UNDO THAT.

00:02.570 --> 00:04.299
LET'S TAKE THE...

00:04.330 --> 00:05.627
LET'S TAKE THOSE OTHER ASSETS

00:05.670 --> 00:07.160
AND MOVE THEM OVER
TO INDONESIA.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.400
SO WHAT DO THOSE
NEW NUMBERS SAY?

00:12.280 --> 00:15.499
THEY'RE SAYING
WE'RE STILL TOO EXPOSED,

00:15.540 --> 00:17.576
PRIMARILY IN EUROPEAN
BOND ETFS.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.646
AND BY MY CALCULATION,

00:19.680 --> 00:23.081
WE COULD STAND TO LOSE
ANOTHER 27 MILLION.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.283
OHH, BUT I THOUGHT...

00:26.320 --> 00:28.459
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:28.490 --> 00:30.151
YEAH.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.055
GOD...

00:32.100 --> 00:34.751
JUST...

00:34.800 --> 00:37.598
I'LL HAVE TO START
ALL OVER.

00:37.630 --> 00:42.203
ABBY, I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR HELP HERE. I DO.

00:42.240 --> 00:46.233
BUT THIS IS MY MESS.
I HAVE TO CLEAN THIS UP.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.373
ANDREW, DON'T BE A MARTYR.

00:48.410 --> 00:51.607
YOU'VE ALREADY GONE WAY
BEYOND THE CALL OF
DUTY HERE,

00:51.650 --> 00:53.811
AND BRANDON AND THE BOYS
ARE WAITING FOR YOU.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.272
OK.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.446
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.242
GOOD NIGHT.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.569
OH, DAMN IT.

01:36.290 --> 01:39.350
ABBY!
ABBY, CALL THE POLICE!

01:56.510 --> 01:59.274
YOU READY TO GO?

02:01.380 --> 02:04.144
YOU OK?

02:04.190 --> 02:05.543
SORRY?

02:05.590 --> 02:07.478
EVERYTHING OK?

02:07.520 --> 02:10.887
YEAH. YEAH,
IT'S JUST, UM...

02:10.930 --> 02:12.522
YOU KNOW LINDA BARNES,

02:12.560 --> 02:14.790
THE BUREAU'S ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
OF NATIONAL SECURITY.

02:14.830 --> 02:16.718
WELL, SHE SAYS SHE NEEDS
TO SET UP A MEETING WITH ME,

02:16.770 --> 02:19.159
PREFERABLY THE DAY
AFI'ER TOMORROW?

02:19.200 --> 02:21.464
THINK SHE WANTS TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THE COVERT WORK

02:21.500 --> 02:22.933
YOU DID IN
THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT?

02:22.970 --> 02:26.428
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.629
AND?

02:27.680 --> 02:29.443
THE LAST TIME
I GOT AN EMAIL LIKE THAT

02:29.480 --> 02:32.244
FROM A PERSON LIKE BARNES,
I WAS TAKEN OFF THE TEAM.

02:32.280 --> 02:34.168
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.915
I HONESTLY DON'T THINK
THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

02:35.950 --> 02:38.316
WELL, I DO.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.489
WELL, WAS EMILY
COPIED ON THE EMAIL?

02:42.430 --> 02:44.455
UH, YEAH, YEAH, SHE IS.

02:44.490 --> 02:45.718
THERE YOU HAVE IT.
EMILY'S NOT GONNA LET
YOU GET CAUGHT UP

02:45.760 --> 02:47.819
IN SOME CRAZY
BUREAUCRATIC UNDERTOW.

02:47.860 --> 02:49.566
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HOTCH
THOUGHT, TOO.

02:49.600 --> 02:50.669
HE COULDN'T PROTECT ME
EITHER.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.668
HEY, GUYS. I KNOW
YOU WERE INCHES FROM

02:52.700 --> 02:54.429
A CLEAN GETAWAY TONIGHT,
BUT I JUST GOT A CALL

02:54.470 --> 02:56.700
FROM D.C. METRO POLICE.
THEY NEED OUR ADVICE

02:56.740 --> 03:00.301
ON AN ACTIVE HOMICIDE SCENE.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.540
AGENTS, I APPRECIATE
YOU COMING OUT.

03:11.590 --> 03:12.955
LIEUTENANT WILSON,
THE BAU IS PREPARED

03:12.990 --> 03:14.651
TO HELP OUT HOWEVER WE CAN.

03:14.690 --> 03:17.352
THESE ARE THE OFFICES
OF A FINANCIAL
MANAGEMENT BUSINESS

03:19.500 --> 03:21.388
THE PROPERTY'S CLEANING CREW
FOUND THE TWO VICTIMS.

03:21.430 --> 03:24.422
THEIR CALL CAME INTO
911 AT 12:53 A.M.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.597
WHEN FIRST RESPONDERS
GOT HERE, THEY FOUND

03:26.640 --> 03:28.267
ONE OF THE FIRM'S
FINANCIAL ADVISERS,

03:28.300 --> 03:30.564
ABIGAIL FULLER,
TIED UP IN HER OFFICE

03:30.610 --> 03:32.237
BUT OTHERWISE UNHARM ED.

03:32.280 --> 03:33.372
WAS MS. FULLER ABLE
TO PROVIDE YOU

03:33.410 --> 03:34.672
WITH A DESCRIPTION
OF HER ATI'ACKER?

03:34.710 --> 03:36.302
NO. SHE WASN'T READY TO.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.238
WE JUST HAD HER TRANSPORTED
TO ST. COLETTE'S.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.611
SHE'S VERY LUCKY.

03:39.650 --> 03:42.414
YOU BET SHE IS.

03:42.450 --> 03:44.384
THIS IS ANDREW HIROTA.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.285
HE WAS SWILCAN CAPITAL'S
MANAGING DIRECTOR

03:46.320 --> 03:48.618
AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER.

03:58.970 --> 04:01.461
THE UNSUB USED
MR. HIROTA'S BLOOD

04:01.500 --> 04:04.663
TO SCRAWL THIS SYMBOL
ON THE WALL.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.837
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT IT MEANS?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.370
IT APPEARS TO BE
AN ATTEMPT TO RENDER

04:08.410 --> 04:09.707
THE SERPENT-ENTWINED STAFF

04:09.750 --> 04:11.775
WIELDED BY THE GREEK GOD
ASCLEPIUS,

04:11.810 --> 04:13.710
WHICH HISTORICALLY
HAS BEEN USED TO SYMBOLIZE

04:13.750 --> 04:15.615
THE ARTS OF HEALING
AND MEDICINE.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.481
MEDICINE. ISN'T THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE
THE OTHER SYMBOL,

04:17.520 --> 04:19.886
THE ONE WITH
THE WINGED STAFF
AND THE TWO SNAKES?

04:19.920 --> 04:21.683
THAT'S ACTUALLY CADUCEUS,
THE ROD OF HERMES.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.426
UNFORTUNATELY,
THE TWO SYMBOLS
ARE OFI'EN MISTAKEN

04:23.460 --> 04:25.587
FOR EACH OTHER BECAUSE
THE US. ARMY MEDICAL CORPS

04:25.630 --> 04:27.325
MISTAKENLY ADOPTED
THE WRONG GREEK SYMBOL

04:27.360 --> 04:30.022
FOR THEIR BRANCH PLAQUE
BACK IN 1902.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.423
I SEE.

04:31.470 --> 04:33.893
BUT WHOEVER THIS
PARTICULAR PSYCHO IS,

04:33.940 --> 04:35.828
OBVIOUSLY HE'S ISN'T
TRYING TO HANG A SHINGLE

04:35.870 --> 04:37.565
FOR A MEDICAL PRACTICE
IN HERE.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.963
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HE'S TRYING TO SAY?

04:39.010 --> 04:41.706
WHATEVER IT IS, IT MAY BE
DIRECTLY CONNECTED

04:41.740 --> 04:43.446
TO MR. HIROTA.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.448
HE WAS TARGETED,
HIS BLOOD WAS USED

04:45.480 --> 04:47.744
TO CREATE THE SYMBOL,
AND HIS BODY

04:47.780 --> 04:50.647
WAS DELIBERATELY STAGED
TO FACE IT.

04:50.690 --> 04:51.941
REID: IT'S ALSO MEANT
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

04:51.990 --> 04:54.686
IT FEELS LIKE A WARNING,
MAYBE EVEN A CALLING CARD.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.484
YEAH, AND IF THE UNSUB
FEELS COMPELLED

04:57.530 --> 04:58.883
TO SIGN HIS DIRTY WORK,

04:58.930 --> 05:01.455
IT SEEMS UNLIKELY
TO BE ONE AND DONE.

05:01.500 --> 05:04.424
NO. THIS ONE'S
JUST GETTING STARTED.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.098
MALE OPERATOR: 911.
WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY?

05:43.140 --> 05:45.768
WE ARE ASCLEPIUS.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.937
WE HAVE BEGUN
THE BLOODLE'I'I'ING.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.402
OPERATOR: EXCUSE ME, SIR?

05:49.450 --> 05:54.012
YOU WILL FEAR US,
FOR YOU ARE THE DISEASE,

05:54.050 --> 05:58.384
AND WE ARE THE CURE.

06:22.710 --> 06:25.907
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.484
REID: "IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO SUFFER

06:35.520 --> 06:37.181
"WITHOUT MAKING
SOMEONE PAY FOR IT.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.757
EVERY COMPLAINT ALREADY
CONTAINS REVENGE."

06:40.800 --> 06:42.688
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.

06:42.730 --> 06:44.925
FOR YOU ARE THE DISEASE,

06:44.970 --> 06:48.599
AND WE ARE THE CURE.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.564
ALRIGHTY, THEN, OUR
SELF-PROCLAIMED ASCLEPIUS

06:51.610 --> 06:54.534
LEFI' THAT ROUSING 911
AT 4:27 THIS MORNING.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.468
WERE YOU ABLE TO RUN
A DIGITAL TRACE?

06:56.510 --> 06:57.704
YES AND NO.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT CAME

06:57.750 --> 06:59.570
FROM THE UKRAINIAN CITY
OF SLOVIANSK?

06:59.620 --> 07:00.609
SIMMONS: SO WHOEVER
WE'RE DEALING WITH

07:00.650 --> 07:02.208
HAS SOME TECHNICAL
SOPHISTICATION.

07:02.250 --> 07:04.138
LEWIS: OR AT LEAST ONE MEMBER
OF THEIR GROUP DOES, RIGHT?

07:04.190 --> 07:07.512
BECAUSE "WE ARE ASCLEPIUS
AND WE ARE THE CURE."

07:07.560 --> 07:09.152
YEAH, WHICH REALLY SOUNDS
LIKE WE MIGHT BE DEALING

07:09.190 --> 07:11.181
WITH SOME SORT OF DOMESTIC
TERRORIST GROUP HERE.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.993
AND POSSIBLY AN ANARCHIST
ACT IVIST GROUP

07:13.030 --> 07:15.658
SIMILAR TO ANONYMOUS,
THOUGH EXPLICITLY MORE
VIOLENT.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.827
EXCEPT THEY DON'T
MENTION THE VICTIM BY NAME,

07:17.870 --> 07:20.794
NOR DO THEY SET FORTH
A SERIOUS LIST OF GRIEVANCES.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.091
SO IF THEY'RE DRIVEN
BY IDEOLOGY,

07:22.140 --> 07:23.732
WHY BE SO COY
ABOUT THEIR GOALS?

07:23.770 --> 07:26.534
THE FIRST GOAL
OF ANY TERRORIST GROUP
IS TO INSTILL FEAR.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.104
LEWIS: YEAH, BUT WHY
START THE REVOLUTION

07:28.140 --> 07:29.846
WITH THE BLOOD
OF ANDREW HIROTA?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.075
HIROTA, 53, DIVORCED,
FATHER OF 3.

07:32.110 --> 07:33.247
NOTHING STANDS OUT
IN HIS VICTIMOLOGY

07:33.280 --> 07:34.679
EXCEPT FOR HIS JOB.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.915
THE SWILCAN CAPITAL GROUP,
ALTHOUGH BOUTIQUE,

07:36.950 --> 07:40.488
HAS $260 MILLION
IN MANAGED ASSETS,

07:40.520 --> 07:42.215
AND MONEY BEING
THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL...

07:42.260 --> 07:44.080
IT IS POSSIBLE
HE WAS TARGETED

07:44.130 --> 07:45.779
BECAUSE OF WHAT HE
WAS SEEN TO SYMBOLIZE

07:45.830 --> 07:48.628
FOR THE GROUP,
SOME EVIL SPECTER
OF WALL STREET.

07:48.660 --> 07:51.197
SIMMONS: ESPECIALLY IF
YOU'RE ALSO SEEN AS BEING
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE

07:51.230 --> 07:52.731
FOR SOME KIND
OF FINANCIAL MISFORTUNE.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.590
ROSSI:
WELL, IF THERE IS THAT
KIND OF ASSOCIATION,

07:54.640 --> 07:57.029
MAYBE ONE OF THESE GUYS
WAS DOING BUSINESS
WITH HIROTA

07:57.070 --> 07:58.606
AND KNEW HIS WAY AROUND
THAT OFFICE.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.176
DAVE, WHY DON'T YOU
AND SPENCE

08:00.210 --> 08:01.871
TAKE ANOTHER WALK
THROUGH THE SCENE.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.174
MA'I'I', JJ, TALK TO
THE MEDICAL EXAMINER.

08:04.210 --> 08:07.111
LUKE, TARA, OUR SURVIVING
WITNESS ABIGAIL FULLER

08:07.150 --> 08:08.742
IS RECOVERING WELL.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.042
SHE'S GONNA BE RELEASED
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

08:10.090 --> 08:11.614
SO IF SHE SEEMS UP FOR IT,

08:11.650 --> 08:13.811
LET'S BRING HER IN HERE
AND GET HER STATEMENT.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.299
I, UH...I'M SO SORRY.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.764
I WANT TO HELP,
IT'S JUST--

08:22.800 --> 08:25.018
I NEVER SAW HIS FACE.

08:25.070 --> 08:28.631
HE WAS, UM, WEARING A MASK.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.968
A SKI MASK, AND, UM,

08:31.010 --> 08:32.637
AND GOGGLES.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.307
ALL BLACK.

08:34.340 --> 08:39.004
I MEAN, HE LOOKED
LIKE A RIOT COP.

08:39.050 --> 08:40.608
MS. FULLER,
DID YOU NOTICE

08:40.650 --> 08:44.142
ANY KIND OF PATCHES
OR INSIGNIAS ON HIS CLOTHING?

08:44.190 --> 08:46.909
NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.315
DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.954
HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

08:51.990 --> 08:56.666
JUST STUCK THIS HUGE GUN
IN MY FACE.

08:56.700 --> 08:58.827
AND HE...

08:58.870 --> 09:01.259
I SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST
TRIED TO SCREAM.

09:01.300 --> 09:04.167
BECAUSE MAYBE ANDREW,
HE WOULD HAVE HEARD ME

09:04.210 --> 09:07.668
AND--AND HE'D STILL
BE ALIVE IF...

09:07.710 --> 09:09.974
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE

09:10.010 --> 09:12.615
TO CHANGE WHAT HAPPENED.

09:12.650 --> 09:14.049
ALVEZ: ARE YOU AWARE
OF ANY THREATS

09:14.080 --> 09:16.071
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE
TO MR. HIROTA PERSONALLY

09:16.120 --> 09:18.714
OR MAYBE EVEN TO
THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE?

09:18.750 --> 09:20.889
THERE WAS THIS
ONE EMAIL,

09:20.920 --> 09:22.729
BUT IT TURNED OUT
TO BE NOTHING.

09:22.760 --> 09:25.024
WELL, RIGHT NOW, WE CAN'T
IGNORE ANYTHING.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.698
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

09:26.730 --> 09:28.823
WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING
THIS YEAR,

09:28.860 --> 09:31.226
AND SOME OF OUR CLIENTS
HAD CONCERNS.

09:31.270 --> 09:35.036
ALVEZ: A THREAT IS MORE
THAN JUST A CONCERN.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.963
SO, WITH THIS EMAIL.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.671
IT WAS SENT ANONYMOUSLY.

09:40.710 --> 09:44.339
AND WHOEVER SENT IT
SAID THAT THEY WOULD
BURN THE PLACE DOWN.

09:47.420 --> 09:51.208
ANDREW HAD ONE OF
OUR I.T. GUYS TRACK
DOWN THE I.P. ADDRESS.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.980
AND THE SENDER
TURNED OUT TO BE
THE TEENAGE SON

09:54.020 --> 09:55.214
TO ONE OF OUR CLIENTS.

09:55.260 --> 09:57.728
BUT ANDREW DECIDED
TO LET IT GO

09:57.760 --> 10:00.126
BECAUSE HE KNEW,
FROM EXPERIENCE,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.253
WHAT THE PRESSURES
OF FINANCIAL UNCERTAINTY

10:02.300 --> 10:04.666
CAN DO TO A HOUSEHOLD.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.395
OK. WHAT'S THE YOUNG
MAN'S NAME?

10:06.430 --> 10:08.739
KYLE REEVES.

10:08.770 --> 10:10.761
HIS FATHER IS PETER.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.672
I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH GARCIA.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.887
THE VICTIM SUFFERED
36 SHARP FORCE INJURIES.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.115
HALF OF THEM WOULD HAVE
PROVEN FATAL ON THEIR OWN.

10:26.150 --> 10:28.015
CLASSIC OVERKILL,

10:28.060 --> 10:29.789
WHICH USUALLY SUGGESTS
A MORE PERSONAL MOTIVE.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.924
NOW, THERE IS SOMETHING
CURIOUS ABOUT ALL TH ESE
INCISED WOUNDS.

10:32.960 --> 10:35.155
SEE HOW JAGGED
EACH ONE IS, AND SHALLOW?

10:35.200 --> 10:38.021
NOT ONE PENETRATED
MORE THAN 4 INCHES DEEP.

10:38.070 --> 10:39.890
ALSO, THE WAY THE SOFI'
TISSUE WAS DAMAGED,

10:39.940 --> 10:41.362
IT APPEARS THAT
THE BLADE WAS CURVED.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.867
HONESTLY, I'VE NEVER SEEN

10:42.910 --> 10:44.104
THIS SPECIFIC TYPE
OF WEAPON BEFORE.

10:44.140 --> 10:46.904
I HAVE.

10:46.940 --> 10:50.103
IT'S CALLED A KARAMBIT.
IT'S A CLOSE-COMBAT WEAPON.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.345
PRETTY POPULAR
IN SOUTH EAST ASIA.

10:54.220 --> 10:58.941
WOMAN: WOW. YOU KNOW,
IT SERIOUSLY LOOKS
LIKE A TINY BAT'LETH.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.451
IT'S A TRADITIONAL
KLINGON WEAPON.

11:02.490 --> 11:04.128
MIA, COULD YOU
JUST FINISH

11:04.160 --> 11:05.957
WITH THOSE AUTOPSY
PHOTOS, PLEASE?

11:05.990 --> 11:08.458
JJ: OK, SO THE UNSUB'S
CHOICE OF WEAPON

11:08.500 --> 11:11.128
SEEMS PRETI'Y CONSISTENT
WITH HIM WEARING
THE TACTICAL GEAR.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.229
SIMMONS: YES, IT DOES.
IT ALSO SUGGESTS HE MAY HAVE

11:13.270 --> 11:15.192
A BACKGROUND IN THE MILITARY
OR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.060
MIA: HEY, GUYS.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.772
HE'S GOT SOMETHING
IN HIS THROAT.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.207
THAT IS DEFINITELY
NOT KLINGON.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.301
ROSSI:
THIS LOOKS AN AWFUL LOT
LIKE THE CRYPTOGRAMS

11:55.340 --> 11:57.103
THE ZODIAC KILLER SENT.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.799
REID: AND THE ZODIAC'S
4 CODED MESSAGES

11:58.850 --> 12:00.909
CERTAINLY DISPLAY
THE SAME BLOCKING
OF TEXT SYMBOLS,

12:00.950 --> 12:03.282
AND THERE ARE 20 LINES
WITH 30 SYMBOLS
IN EACH LINE,

12:03.320 --> 12:06.084
BUT WHERE THE ZODIAC
USED SYMBOLS FROM
7 DIFFERENT SOURCES,

12:06.120 --> 12:08.384
THIS UNSUB APPEARS
TO BE USING LETTERS

12:08.420 --> 12:09.921
FROM 4 PURE ALPHABETS--

12:09.960 --> 12:12.178
LATIN, GREEK,
CYRILLIC, AND KOREAN.

12:12.230 --> 12:14.152
OK. THE FIRST THING
I CAN TELL YOU

12:14.200 --> 12:15.849
IS THAT KYLE REEVES
DID NOT WRITE THAT

12:15.900 --> 12:18.118
BECAUSE A SERIES OF
INAPPROPRIATE EMAILS

12:18.170 --> 12:19.523
LANDED HIM IN JUVIE
LAST WEEK.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.993
SO, SPENCE, HOW LONG WILL
IT TAKE YOU TO CRACK IT?

12:22.040 --> 12:23.905
OOH, OOH, WITH MY HELP,
CONSIDER IT ALREADY CRACKED.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.237
I'M CRAZY FOR CRYPTOGRAMS.

12:25.270 --> 12:26.532
5 WILL GET YOU 20
THAT'S A HOMOPHONIC CIPHER,

12:26.570 --> 12:28.276
LIKE YOUR CLASSIC
CAESAR CIPH ER.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.800
REID:
YEAH, BUT WHERE ONE
LETTER OF UNCODED TEXT

12:29.850 --> 12:31.977
CAN BE TRANSPOSED
INTO ONE LETTER
OF CODED TEXT.

12:32.010 --> 12:34.149
HERE, ONE LETTER
OF UNCODED TEXT
CAN BE REPLACED

12:34.180 --> 12:36.273
BY A CODE LETTER
FROM EACH OF THE
4 PURE ALPHABETS.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.345
BRAINIAC, YOU'RE MAKING
IT SOUND WAY MORE
CONFUSING THAN IT IS.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.812
I DIDN'T TELL THEM
ABOUT THE KEY NUMBER
WE'RE GONNA NEED

12:39.860 --> 12:41.885
IN ORDER TO DETERMINE
THE ACTUAL SHII-T VALUE.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.126
YEAH.

12:44.960 --> 12:46.848
MAYBE WE'LL JUST
LEAVE YOU TO IT.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.026
NO, NO, NO, WE GOT THIS.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.493
IT'S ALL IN THE
FREQUENCY ANALYSIS.

12:49.530 --> 12:51.066
EXACTLY. SO LET'S
START WITH THE
MOST COMMON LETTER

12:51.100 --> 12:52.362
IN THE ENGLISH
LANGUAGE. "E."

12:52.400 --> 12:54.334
ARE YOU FLIRTING WITH ME?

12:54.370 --> 12:56.065
'CAUSE "E" HAPPENS TO BE
MY FAVORITE VOWEL.

12:56.100 --> 12:59.103
OK, IF WE HYPOTHESIZE
THAT THAT IS TRUE,
THEN THAT COULD MEAN

12:59.140 --> 13:02.177
THAT OUR TRANSPOSITIONAL
SHIl-T VALUE EQUALS 3,

13:02.210 --> 13:07.944
AND IF THAT'S TRUE,
THEN OUR DECRYPTION
LOOKS LIKE...

13:12.250 --> 13:14.389
THIS.

13:16.490 --> 13:20.256
"WE, ASCLEPIUS,
DECLARE THIS MANIFESTO.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.460
"INSTITUTIONS LED BY
IMPOTENT MEN

13:26.500 --> 13:30.106
"IN OUR HOUSES OF LAW,
CAPITAL, AND WORSHIP,

13:30.140 --> 13:33.200
"WHOSE INFIDELITIES TO THOSE
THEY CLAIM TO SAFEGUARD

13:33.240 --> 13:34.434
HAVE POISON ED US."

13:34.480 --> 13:37.472
ROSSI: "THESE MEN
ARE THE ESSENTIAL CAUSE
OF OUR SOCIAL ILLS

13:37.510 --> 13:39.876
"AND IT IS THE REASON
THEY ARE TODAY, TOMORROW,

13:39.920 --> 13:43.447
AND FOREVER THE DISEASE
AND WE ARE THE CURE."

13:45.990 --> 13:48.618
THEY SURE AS HELL AIN'T
TALKING ABOUT THE BAND.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.855
BUT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT
A PATTERN OF VICTIMOLOGY.

13:50.890 --> 13:52.949
THIS ASCLEPIUS
INTENDS TO TARGET MEN

13:53.000 --> 13:55.560
FROM THE FIELDS OF LAW,
FINANCE, AND RELIGION.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.227
NOW, LOOK AT THIS
PART RIGHT HERE.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.488
"TERMS OF SURRENDER ARE OFFERED"

13:59.530 --> 14:01.361
IF WE LET THE NEWS MEDIA

14:01.400 --> 14:03.368
BROADCAST
THIS MANIFESTO TONIGHT.

14:03.410 --> 14:07.005
SO IF WE PUT THAT OUT THERE,
THEN THIS WILL ALL STOP?

14:07.040 --> 14:08.405
NO, IT'S LIKELY
A NARCISSISTIC

14:08.440 --> 14:10.044
POWER PLAY,
IF WE INDULGE IT,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.968
MIGHT CAUSE
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

14:12.010 --> 14:14.012
REID: BUT THIS EXPRESSION
OF NARCISSISM DOES TELL US

14:14.050 --> 14:15.517
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH
A SINGLE UNSUB.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.984
THIS PROVOCATIVE
POSTURING SUGGESTS
A PERSONALITY TYPE

14:18.020 --> 14:19.988
THAT NEEDS TO FEEL
SUPERIOR TO OTHERS.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.578
WHY MAKE US THINK
IT'S A GROUP?

14:21.620 --> 14:24.123
HE'S TRYING TO INSTILL FEAR
BY CREATING STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.525
PRENTISS:
BUT IT'S UNUSUAL
FOR A NARCISSIST

14:25.560 --> 14:27.391
TO PROVOKE FEAR
IN THIS WAY.

14:27.430 --> 14:30.263
YOU'D EXPECT HE'D JUST
WANT TO MAKE HIMSELF
LOOK MORE DANGEROUS.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.268
IT'S ALSO UNUSUAL
THAT THIS GUY WOULD BOTHER

14:32.300 --> 14:36.134
TO WRITE A MANIFESTO
THESE DAYS AND NOT
POST IT ONLINE.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.604
INSTEAD, HE FOLDS IT UP
INTO A PUZZLE

14:38.640 --> 14:39.902
AND JAMS IT DOWN
HIS VICTIM'S THROAT.

14:39.940 --> 14:44.673
WHICH MEANS THIS MESSAGE
WAS REALLY JUST MEANT
FOR OUR EYES ONLY,

14:44.710 --> 14:47.372
THAT IS, IF WE WERE ABLE
TO DECIPHER IT.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.012
ROSSI: THE GAME IS AFOOT.

14:49.050 --> 14:51.939
HIS GAME, WITH US.

14:51.990 --> 14:55.084
HE MAY PROFILE AS A HYBRID
OF THE ZODIAC KILLER

14:55.120 --> 14:57.452
AND THE UNABOMBER,
BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME

14:57.490 --> 14:59.629
HIS REAL MOTIVE
LIES SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:59.660 --> 15:01.423
AND UNTIL WE KNOW
WHAT IT IS,

15:01.460 --> 15:06.124
THIS UNSUB WILL REMAIN
IN THE SHADOW OF THE NIGHT.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.641
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT,
MR. CARMICHAEL.

15:19.410 --> 15:22.413
HEY, JEFF,
IT'S DOUGLAS, FROM BVP.

15:22.450 --> 15:26.284
KAYLA TOLD ME YOU CALLED AND
THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A DELAY?

15:26.320 --> 15:28.515
NO. NO. LISTEN TO ME.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.120
FIX THIS.
WE HAVE A DEADLINE.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.718
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LOOK LIKE AN IDIOT

15:32.760 --> 15:36.548
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DO
YOUR DAMN JOB!

15:36.600 --> 15:38.158
AAH!

15:38.200 --> 15:40.339
AAH! SON OF A BITCH!

15:43.370 --> 15:45.065
WAIT! SON OF A--

15:45.110 --> 15:46.259
HELP!

15:46.310 --> 15:48.175
HELP! HELP ME!

15:48.210 --> 15:49.370
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

15:55.580 --> 15:57.411
MATT, JJ, OUR UNSUB
STRUCK AGAIN LAST NIGHT.

15:57.450 --> 15:58.986
GARCIA SHOULD BE SENDING
YOU THE ADDRESS NOW.

15:59.020 --> 16:01.215
OK, GOT IT.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

16:10.630 --> 16:13.292
HEY, UH, WHAT DO YOU KNOW

16:13.340 --> 16:15.991
ABOUT ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
LINDA BARNES?

16:16.040 --> 16:18.258
YOU MEAN BESIDES
THE FACT THAT SHE'S
THE ONE RESPONSIBLE

16:18.310 --> 16:20.198
FOR DECOMMISSIONING
MY OLD I.R.T. UNIT?

16:20.240 --> 16:22.333
I THOUGHT THAT ORDER
CAME DOWN FROM THE DIRECTOR

16:22.380 --> 16:24.302
AI-TER YOUR UNIT CHIEF
COMPROMISED A MISSION
IN RUSSIA.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.170
NO, IT WAS A LITTLE MORE
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.440
YOU SEE, BARNES SPEARHEADED
AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION

16:28.480 --> 16:30.243
DESIGNED TO UNDERMINE
THE CONFIDENCE

16:30.290 --> 16:32.747
OF EACH INDIVIDUAL
I.R.T. MEMBER.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.611
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

16:35.660 --> 16:38.379
BARNES PROFILES
AS PURE POLITICAL ANIMAL.

16:38.430 --> 16:40.227
EYES ON THE PRIZE.

16:40.260 --> 16:43.320
SO, YOU THINK SHE WANTS
TO BE DIRECTOR.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.497
SHE'S ALREADY REMADE
THE BUREAU'S
FOREIGN SERVICE UNITS

16:45.530 --> 16:46.690
IN HER OWN IMAGE.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.231
FOR HER,
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE JOB,

16:48.270 --> 16:50.135
IT'S ABOUT
CONSOLIDATING POWER.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.607
SHE SAYS SHE WANTS
TO TALK TO ME

16:53.640 --> 16:55.471
ABOUT REVIEWING SOME
COVERT WORK

16:55.510 --> 16:57.546
I DID A FEW YEARS BACK.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.639
DOES PRENTISS
KNOW ABOUT THIS?

16:59.680 --> 17:01.648
YEAH. YEAH, SHE WAS COPIED
ON THE EMAIL,

17:01.680 --> 17:04.547
BUT I STILL HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO TALK TO HER
ABOUT IT YET.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.295
CORONER JUST
TRANSPORTED THE BODY.

17:18.330 --> 17:21.436
IT LOOKS LIKE
HE WAS AMBUSHED
AND THEN STAGED THE SAME,

17:21.470 --> 17:23.267
FACING THE SYMBOL.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.608
THE VICTIM'S NAME
IS DOUGLAS CARMICHAEL,

17:25.640 --> 17:28.404
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
OF BVP WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIES.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.408
I'M TOLD IT'S AN AEROSPACE
ENGINEERING COMPANY,

17:30.450 --> 17:32.145
AND THIS IS THEIR
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS.

17:32.180 --> 17:34.171
SO THE UNSUB'S
FIRST TWO VICTIMS
WERE BUSINESSMEN TYPES,

17:34.220 --> 17:36.211
EVEN THOUGH HE DID
TH REATEN TO TARGET

17:36.250 --> 17:38.218
MEN OF LAW,
BUSINESS, AND RELIGION.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.151
AND THIS TIME HE CAUGHT
CARMICHAEL OUTSIDE
OF HIS OFFICE,

17:41.190 --> 17:43.226
RATHER THAN INSIDE,
LIKE THE FIRST VICTIM.

17:43.260 --> 17:44.386
WELL, THERE WAS
A SECURITY GUARD

17:44.430 --> 17:46.159
INSIDE AT THE FRONT DESK
LAST NIGHT.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.691
WHY DIDN'T HE RESPOND?

17:47.730 --> 17:49.527
THAT CAMERA UP THERE
WENT DOWN

17:49.560 --> 17:51.824
AN HOUR BEFORE CARMICHAEL
EXITED THE BUILDING.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.758
THE GUARD HAD NO IDEA
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.291
SIMMONS: THE UNSUB
PROBABLY DISABLED IT,
WHICH IS CONSISTENT

17:56.340 --> 17:58.706
WITH THE TECHNICAL SKILLS
HE'S BEEN DEMONSTRATING.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.129
IT ALSO MEANS HE'S PRETTY
FAMILIAR WITH THIS PROPERTY,

18:01.180 --> 18:04.445
JUST LIKE THE LAST LOCATION.
AND IT'S CRITICAL

18:04.480 --> 18:05.777
BECAUSE HE CAN'T LEAVE
ANYTHING TO CHANCE,

18:05.810 --> 18:09.143
OTHERWISE HE WON'T HAVE TIME
TO STAGE THE SCENES.

18:09.180 --> 18:11.182
SO THE UNSUB ISN'T JUST
STALKING HIS VICTIMS.

18:11.220 --> 18:12.710
HE'S SCOUTED
THEIR MURDER SCENES.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.650
THE METHODOLOGY SUGGESTS
HE'S GOT A LIST

18:14.690 --> 18:17.557
OF PRESELECT ED SOFT TARGETS.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.126
LEWIS: DR. COOKE JUST
PULLED ANOTHER CRYPTOGRAM

18:19.160 --> 18:20.718
FROM DOUGLAS
CARMICHAEL'S THROAT.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.126
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE LAST ONE.

18:24.230 --> 18:25.424
GARCIA: OK, GIVE ME ONE SECOND

18:25.470 --> 18:28.189
WHILE I APPLY
OUR KEY SHIFT DECRYPTION.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.367
AND VOILA.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.577
THAT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS
EXPECTING TO HAVE HAPPEN.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.770
TRY ALL POSSIBLE
KEY SHIFT VALUES.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.753
NO, NOTHING.

18:50.790 --> 18:52.326
IT'S THE SAME
4 PURE ALPHABET,

18:52.360 --> 18:53.793
ONLY THIS ONE'S NOT
A CAESAR CIPHER.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.195
THIS IS GONNA BE
A LOT HARDER TO CRACK.

18:55.230 --> 18:58.563
ROSSI: YOU KNOW, I WAS
SKEPTICAL THAT SOMEONE
DRIVEN PURELY BY IDEOLOGY

18:58.600 --> 19:00.761
WOULD BURY HIS MANIFESTO
INSIDE OF A PUZZLE.

19:00.800 --> 19:03.303
BUT NOW, HE'S DOUBLING DOWN.

19:03.340 --> 19:04.898
IT SPEAKS MORE TO HIS NEED
TO ASSERT HIS POWER,

19:04.940 --> 19:06.601
PARTICULARLY
OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT,

19:06.640 --> 19:09.336
LIKE THE ZODIAC KILLER,
WHO ALSO PRODUCED
4 CRYPTOGRAMS,

19:09.380 --> 19:11.405
ONLY ONE OF WHICH
HAS BEEN COMPLETELY SOLVED.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.544
WHAT IF ASSERTING HIS POWER
OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT

19:14.580 --> 19:16.548
IS THIS GUY'S
REAL MOTIVATION?

19:16.580 --> 19:17.683
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE
YOU SAID, DAVID,

19:17.720 --> 19:20.188
IT COULD BE ALL ABOUT
HIS CRAZY GAME.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.915
LEWIS: SO YOU'RE
THINKING THAT THESE
MURDERS

19:21.960 --> 19:23.928
AND HIS CODED MESSAGES
ARE HIS WAY OF TAUNTING

19:23.960 --> 19:25.928
AND THEN HUMILIATING
THE D.C. METRO POLICE.

19:25.960 --> 19:28.258
ALVEZ: OR EVEN THE FBI.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.927
OUR SURVIVING WITNESS,
ABIGAIL FULLER,

19:29.960 --> 19:33.498
SHE DESCRIBED HER ASSAILANT
AS LOOKING LIKE A RIOT COP.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.395
HIS CHOICE OF WEAPON
AND TACTICAL SKILLS

19:36.440 --> 19:38.431
DO SUGGEST THAT
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY

19:38.470 --> 19:41.405
HE HAS A BACKGROUND
IN EITHER THE MILITARY
OR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.340
SO WE MIGHT BE DEALING
WITH A GUY

19:43.380 --> 19:45.678
WHO'S HARBORING
REAL OR IMAGINED GRIEVANCES

19:45.710 --> 19:48.816
AGAINST THE COPS OR US.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.784
LEWIS: IF THIS GUY'S
GOAL IS RETRIBUTION
AGAINST THE POLICE,

19:50.820 --> 19:53.550
THEN WHAT DOES HIS
PATTERN OF VICTIMOLOGY
ACTUALLY MEAN TO HIM?

19:54.660 --> 19:55.752
WELL, I'VE BEEN THINKING

19:55.790 --> 19:57.587
ABOUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE
HE CHOSE TO USE

19:57.630 --> 19:59.427
IN HIS FIRST CIPHER
WITH US.

19:59.460 --> 20:02.588
HE SAYS, "WE'RE BEING LED
BY IMPOTENT MEN."

20:02.630 --> 20:04.825
AND YET IT'S THEIR
"INFIDELITIES"

20:04.870 --> 20:07.964
THAT MADE THEM THE DISEASE
HE'S GOING TO CURE.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.934
LEWIS: HIS WORDS DO SEEM
EMOTIONALLY CONFUSED

20:09.970 --> 20:12.962
AND UNUSUALLY SEXUALIZED
FOR A POLITICAL MANIFESTO.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.534
YEAH, IT SOUNDS LIKE
HE'S PISSED OFF

20:14.580 --> 20:17.299
AT AN UNFAITHFUL
SIGNIFICANT OTHER.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.443
ALVEZ: MAYBE OUR UNSUB'S
MALE VICTIMS

20:19.480 --> 20:21.345
AREN'T JUST PAWNS
IN A CRAZY GAME.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.348
MAYBE THEY'RE ACTUALLY
SURROGATES.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.881
REID: I THINK SUBCONSCIOUSLY
THROUGH THESE CRYPTOGRAMS,

20:25.920 --> 20:28.457
HE'S TRYING TO TELL US
HIS REAL TARGET.

20:28.490 --> 20:30.856
GUYS, YOU AND GARCIA
GET ON THAT.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.290
TARA, LUKE, WORK WITH
LIEUTENANT WILSON

20:33.330 --> 20:35.992
ON A LIST OF POTENTIAL
SUSPECT S THAT ARE CONNECTED
TO D.C. METRO.

20:36.030 --> 20:39.693
DAVE AND I WILL DO THE SAME
FROM HERE ON THE BUREAU'S END.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.671
I DON'T KNOW, SPENCE,
IF THIS GUY
IS MESSING WITH US.

21:28.720 --> 21:30.915
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THESE CRYPTOGRAMS AREN'T
TOTALLY MEANINGLESS?

21:30.950 --> 21:32.781
BECAUSE THESE CIPHERS
ARE HIS WAY TO DEMONSTRATE

21:32.820 --> 21:35.311
HIS SUPERIOR INTELLECT,
AND IT'S HONESTLY
THAT ARROGANT STREAK

21:35.360 --> 21:36.918
THAT MAKES ME THINK
HE WOULDN'T COMPLETELY
RE-CONCEIVE

21:36.960 --> 21:38.518
HIS ENCRYPTION STRATEGY.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.584
SO YOU STILL THINK
WE'RE DEALING WITH

21:39.630 --> 21:40.892
A SUBSTITUTION CIPH ER?

21:40.930 --> 21:42.056
I DO, EXCEPT NOW
INSTEAD OF USING

21:42.100 --> 21:43.658
JUST ONE SHIFT VALUE
FOR EACH WORD

21:43.700 --> 21:44.928
IN HIS PLAIN TEXT MESSAGE,

21:44.970 --> 21:46.722
HE'S UTILIZING
MULTIPLE SHIFT VALUES

21:46.770 --> 21:48.635
ACROSS ALL 4
OF THESE ALPHABETS.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.900
OK. I BUY THAT.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.445
I SWEAR I'VE SEEN THIS KIND
OF CIPHER SOMEWHERE BEFORE.

21:57.480 --> 21:58.970
I'M SURE YOU HAVE.
IT'S CALLED
A VIGENERE CIPHER,

21:59.010 --> 22:01.945
AND IT USES ONE
KEY WORD TO DETERMINE
ALL SHIFT VALUES.

22:01.980 --> 22:04.540
OK, SO, EVEN IF THIS GUY'S
KEY WORD IS IN ENGLISH,

22:04.590 --> 22:06.080
THERE'S LIKE THOUSANDS
OF POSSIBILITIES.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.658
171,476 ACCORDING TO
THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY,

22:09.690 --> 22:11.851
BUT WE KNOW THIS GUY'S
EGO

22:11.890 --> 22:14.927
SO...TRY THE WORD "CURE,"

22:14.960 --> 22:16.689
SINCE HE SEES HIMSELF
AS THE CURE.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.561
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.862
C-U-R-E.

22:19.900 --> 22:22.539
AND THE ALPHABET WILL
GIVE US OUR SHIFT VALUES.

22:26.010 --> 22:29.138
VOILA. THERE IT IS.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.899
LOOK, HAMMER,
YOU NAILED IT.

22:31.950 --> 22:34.578
"WE, ASCLEPIUS, DECLARE
THIS OUR FINAL WARNING

22:34.620 --> 22:37.009
TO THOSE COMPLICIT
WITH THE ROTTING FLESH"--

22:37.050 --> 22:38.745
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
DOWN HERE.

22:38.790 --> 22:41.156
"THIS THIRD CORPSE MARKS
THE BEGINNING OF THE END."

22:41.190 --> 22:42.987
WE DON'T HAVE 3 CORPSES.

22:43.020 --> 22:45.989
WE HAVE ANDREW HIROTA
AND DOUGLAS CARMICHAEL.

22:46.030 --> 22:47.793
THIS UNSUB HAS NO REASON
TO TAKE CREDIT

22:47.830 --> 22:49.024
FOR SOMETHING HE DIDN'T DO.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.596
THIS VICTIM MUST BE
A HOMICIDE THAT D.C. METRO

22:50.630 --> 22:52.063
DOESN'T REALIZE
IS CONNECTED WITH THE OTHERS.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.465
HOW THE PLANETS
COULD THEY MISS THAT?

22:53.500 --> 22:54.831
EVEN IF HE WASN'T USING
THE SAME M.O.,

22:54.870 --> 22:56.132
HE WOULD HAVE LEFT
A BLOODY SYMBOL

22:56.170 --> 22:58.468
OR A CIPHER OR SOMETHING
EQUALLY CREEPTASTIC.

22:58.510 --> 23:01.502
LET'S REVIEW ALL OPEN CASES IN
D.C. METRO OVER THE LAST MONTH.

23:01.540 --> 23:02.677
OK.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.459
AH! UNH!

23:19.490 --> 23:21.651
AAH! AAH!

23:21.700 --> 23:22.894
AAH! AAH!

23:24.800 --> 23:26.062
STOP! STOP!

23:26.100 --> 23:28.637
OH, PLEASE HURRY! HE'S
STABBING MY BOYFRIEND!

23:28.670 --> 23:29.864
ELENA, GET BACK INSIDE!

23:29.900 --> 23:32.061
GET BACK INSIDE!

23:36.210 --> 23:37.643
AAH...

23:38.880 --> 23:40.643
OH, SCOTT!

23:40.680 --> 23:42.648
OH!
WHAT...

23:44.120 --> 23:46.111
THE AMBULANCE
IS ALMOST HERE.

23:46.150 --> 23:47.583
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

23:47.620 --> 23:49.986
SCOTT, DON'T CLOSE
YOUR EYES. LOOK AT ME.

23:50.020 --> 23:52.079
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.504
LOOKS AS THOUGH
WE HAVE A SURVIVOR.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.871
HIS NAME IS SCOTT TAVERAS.

24:07.910 --> 24:09.468
HE'S OUT OF SURGERY
AND IN STABLE CONDITION.

24:09.510 --> 24:11.068
WE WERE TOLD
SOMEONE SAVED HIM?

24:11.110 --> 24:12.998
YEAH. HE WAS VERY LUCKY.

24:13.050 --> 24:15.041
APPARENTLY TAVERAS
IS SEPARATED FROM HIS WIFE,

24:15.080 --> 24:16.547
MOVED OUT OF THE HOUSE
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.946
BUT HIS GIRLFRIEND,
A WOMAN NAMED ELENA DURAN,

24:18.990 --> 24:20.480
JUST HAPPENED TO BE
AT HIS NEW PLACE TONIGHT--

24:20.520 --> 24:22.078
STARTLED THE ATTACKER,
CALLED 911.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.883
WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT TAVERAS?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.022
FAMILY COURT JUDGE.

24:25.060 --> 24:27.153
SITS ON THE BENCH
AT MCNAB COURTHOUSE.

24:27.190 --> 24:30.125
FAMILY COURT. SEEMS LIKE
KIND OF AN ODD FIT

24:30.160 --> 24:32.628
FOR OUR UNSUB'S PATTERN
OF VICTIMOLOGY, DOESN'T IT?

24:32.670 --> 24:34.797
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD GET A STATEMENT
FROM TAVERAS

24:34.840 --> 24:37.934
AND ALSO TALK
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND.

24:45.250 --> 24:46.842
THANKS, GUYS.
JUST GO AHEAD

24:46.880 --> 24:49.041
AND PUT THEM RIGHT THERE.
APPRECIATE IT.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.843
WHAT DID YOU FIND?

24:50.890 --> 24:53.279
IT'S AN OPEN CASE
IN GEORGETOWN,

24:53.320 --> 24:54.617
TWO WEEKS AGO.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.912
VICTIM'S NAME
IS MARCUS POWELL.

24:56.960 --> 24:59.258
HE WAS STABBED TO DEATH
IN HIS DRIVEWAY.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.019
D.C. POLICE REPORT
DESCRIBES THE ATTACK

25:01.060 --> 25:02.527
AS PART OF
AN ATTEMPTED ROBBERY.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.891
MM-HMM. BUT KEEP READING.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.124
THERE'S SOME CURIOUS
CONNECTIONS TO OUR CASE.

25:05.170 --> 25:08.230
POWELL WAS FAMILY
SERVICES DIRECTOR AT
THE MCNAB COURTHOUSE.

25:08.270 --> 25:10.158
THAT IS THE COURTHOUSE
THAT SCOTT TAVERAS

25:10.200 --> 25:13.067
PRESIDES OVER
AS A FAMILY COURT JUDGE.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.078
THAT'S AN ODDLY
RELATED VICTIMOLOGY.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.737
HIS WOUND PATTERN
EVEN SUGGESTS

25:16.780 --> 25:18.668
A SIMILAR
SHARP FORCE WEAPON,

25:18.710 --> 25:20.917
BUT IT'S BY NO MEANS
CONCLUSIVE.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.783
RIGHT. 'CAUSE HE WOULD HAVE
LEFT A CREEPY CRYPTOGRAM

25:23.820 --> 25:26.141
OR A BLOODY SYMBOL
OR SOMETHING.

25:26.190 --> 25:29.011
WHAT IF THE ASCLEPIUS
SYMBOL IN BLOOD,

25:29.060 --> 25:30.948
LIKE THE 911 CALL,
WAS ACTUALLY

25:30.990 --> 25:33.697
PART OF THE UNSUB'S
PLAN B--AN ELABORATE
COUNTERMEASURE

25:33.730 --> 25:34.992
TAKEN OUT OF
FRUSTRATION

25:35.030 --> 25:36.327
AFTER LAW ENFORCEMENT
SOMEHOW MISSED

25:36.360 --> 25:37.668
THE HIDDEN CIPHER
AT THE FIRST SCENE?

25:37.700 --> 25:40.567
YEAH, BUT THE POLICE
WOULD HAVE SEEN IT.
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.067
ONE OF THE WITNESSES
SAID THAT SHE
SAW MR. POWELL

25:42.100 --> 25:43.294
COME HOME AND COLLECT
HIS MAIL

25:43.340 --> 25:45.069
MOMENTS BEFORE
HE SCREAMED FOR HELP.

25:52.380 --> 25:54.917
OUR UNSUB'S FIRST CIPHER.

25:58.850 --> 26:00.681
HERE'S SOME MORE
DESSERT, SCOTT.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.859
OHH. THANK YOU.

26:02.890 --> 26:05.586
LEWIS: MR. AND MRS.
TAVERAS, WE KNOW THIS IS
A DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU,

26:05.630 --> 26:07.325
AND OUR QUESTIONS
AREN'T MEANT TO PRY.

26:07.360 --> 26:09.123
BUT NOW YOU REALLY NEED
TO START ASKING MY HUSBAND

26:09.160 --> 26:11.128
HOW HIS GIRLFRIEND
SAVED HIS LIFE, RIGHT?

26:11.170 --> 26:12.262
THAT'S RIGHT.

26:12.300 --> 26:14.598
HEY. YOU WATCH
THAT "48 HOURS"?

26:14.640 --> 26:16.733
THEY NEED TO ELIMINATE
YOU AS A SUSPECT.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.102
ALVEZ:
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU

26:20.140 --> 26:22.074
MAINTAINING A SENSE
OF HUMOR, MR. TAVERAS.

26:22.110 --> 26:25.147
HUH. WELL, IF I CAN'T LAUGH,

26:25.180 --> 26:27.944
I'M GONNA CRY,
'CAUSE THIS...

26:27.980 --> 26:31.017
THIS IS CRAZY.

26:31.050 --> 26:32.608
WHY ME?

26:32.650 --> 26:33.719
LEWIS: YOU'VE NEVER RECEIVED

26:33.760 --> 26:35.011
ANY KIND OF A THREAT,
PERSONALLY,

26:35.060 --> 26:36.755
OR EVEN ONE DIRECTED
AT THE COURT?

26:36.790 --> 26:40.920
NO. NOT REALLY, NOT, UH...

26:40.960 --> 26:43.963
NOT IN SO MANY WORDS.
I MEAN...

26:44.000 --> 26:48.892
BUT IT'S MY JOB TO DECIDE
THE CUSTODY OF A CHILD.

26:48.940 --> 26:53.730
SO, I'M THE ONE
WHO SPLITS THE BABY, RIGHT?

26:53.780 --> 26:56.169
WHICH MEANS I'M USUALLY
A SON OF A BITCH

26:56.210 --> 26:57.643
TO SOMEBODY
LEAVING MY COURTROOM.

26:57.680 --> 26:58.772
GIRL: DAD!

26:58.810 --> 27:01.745
OH, MY GOD!
THANK GOD YOU'RE OK.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.680
I'M SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.984
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

27:06.020 --> 27:07.317
I LOVE YOU, TOO,
SWEETH EART.

27:07.350 --> 27:09.011
BOY: HAVE THE POLICE
CAUGHT THE GUY YET?

27:09.060 --> 27:11.028
NO, SON, NO, NOT YET.

27:11.060 --> 27:13.756
BUT THESE ARE AGENTS
FROM THE FBI,

27:13.800 --> 27:14.824
AND THEY'RE DOING
EVERYTHING THEY CAN

27:14.860 --> 27:17.055
TO HUNT THE MAN DOWN.

27:29.310 --> 27:33.849
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH SCOTT
ISN'T REALLY AS AWIONARD
AS IT MIGHT LOOK.

27:33.880 --> 27:37.213
HE AND HIS WIFE AGREED
TO A SEPARATION
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

27:37.250 --> 27:41.687
AND THAT'S WHEN
HE AND I FIRST MET.

27:43.090 --> 27:47.356
BUT THEN JULIA WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER,

27:47.390 --> 27:51.019
AND SO SCOTT DIDN'T
WANT THINGS TO GET
TOO COMPLICATED

27:51.070 --> 27:52.321
FOR HER AND THEIR
HEALTH INSURANCE,

27:52.370 --> 27:54.133
SO THEY DECIDED TO
REMAIN LEGALLY MARRIED.

27:54.170 --> 27:56.297
MRS. TAVERAS HAS CANCER?

27:56.340 --> 27:59.036
NO. WELL,
SHE'S BEEN IN REMISSION

27:59.070 --> 28:01.231
FOR 6 MONTHS NOW,
THANK GOODNESS.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.078
WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU
AND MR. TAVERAS MOVE IN
TOGETHER?

28:04.110 --> 28:05.805
WE DON'T ACTUALLY
LIVE TOGETHER.

28:05.850 --> 28:08.171
I JUST HAVE A KEY
TO HIS TOWNHOUSE.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.972
AND TONIGHT, SCOTT
CALLED AND ASKED ME

28:10.020 --> 28:14.184
IF I COULD, UH...
MEET HIM AT HOME.

28:16.320 --> 28:22.259
AND SO I WAS THERE
AND SAW HIM PULL IN.

28:23.870 --> 28:27.397
AND THEN I HEARD
THIS, LIKE, BIG THUD

28:27.430 --> 28:30.365
RIGHT OUTSIDE
THE FRONT DOOR.

28:31.940 --> 28:37.333
AND THEN I HEARD
SCOTT YELLING...

28:40.780 --> 28:47.982
SO I GRABBED MY PHONE.
I--I DIALED 911 AND...

28:48.020 --> 28:49.385
AND I RAN OUTSIDE
TO HELP.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.456
PLEASE HURRY!
HE'S STABBING MY BOYFRIEND!

28:51.490 --> 28:54.994
AND THEN HE WAS GOING
TO KILL ME, TOO,

28:55.030 --> 28:57.248
BUT FOR SOME REASON,
HE DIDN'T.

28:57.300 --> 29:00.394
HE JUST LOOKED AT ME...

29:07.140 --> 29:10.337
AND THEN HE RAN AWAY.

29:15.250 --> 29:17.411
HERE. LOOK AT
THESE TWO PHOTOS

29:17.450 --> 29:18.940
FROM THE SCOTT TAVERAS
CRIME SCENE

29:18.990 --> 29:20.878
AND TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE.

29:20.920 --> 29:21.887
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I DON'T SEE.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.059
I DON'T SEE
A NINJA-LIKE UNSUB

29:24.090 --> 29:25.819
WHO SO SKILLFULLY
AND SAVAGELY

29:25.860 --> 29:27.384
BLITZED HIS FIRST
TWO VICTIMS.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.796
YES. THIS ACT
FEELS MORE IMPULSIVE.

29:29.830 --> 29:31.525
THE PSYCHOLOGIST SAM KEEN

29:31.570 --> 29:33.322
HAS A THEORY ABOUT
HUMAN BEHAVIOR

29:33.370 --> 29:34.860
THAT I TEND
TO SUBSCRIBE TO.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.834
HE BELIEVES
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

29:36.870 --> 29:38.906
FOR A PERSON
TO KILL ANOTHER

29:38.940 --> 29:41.408
WITHOUT FIRST BEING ABLE
TO OBJECTIFY THEM.

29:41.440 --> 29:44.273
THAT THEORY WOULD EXPLAIN
OUR UNSUB'S BEHAVIOR.

29:44.310 --> 29:47.438
MAYBE HE'S STRUGGLING
TO DEHUMANIZE HIS VICTIM.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.574
MAYBE BECAUSE OF SOME
PERSONAL CONNECTION
WITH SCOTT TAVERAS.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.042
ABOUT AS PERSONAL
AS YOU CAN GET.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.341
GARCIA AND I
WERE ABLE TO CRACK

29:53.390 --> 29:54.812
THE UNSUB'S LAST CIPHER.

29:54.860 --> 29:56.282
IN IT, HE BRAGGED ABOUT
A VICTIM THAT WE MISSED.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.322
HIS NAME IS MARCUS POWELL,

29:58.360 --> 30:01.124
AND IN MISSING MR. POWELL,
D.C. METRO ALSO MISSED

30:01.160 --> 30:03.094
OUR UNSUB'S DEBUT CIPHER,
WHICH BASICALLY

30:03.130 --> 30:04.427
READS LIKE A FIRST DRAFT
OF HIS MANIFESTO.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.519
BUT A FIRST DRAFT
THAT REVEALS THAT TOO
MUCH REAL EMOTIONAL PAIN.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.458
WORD CHOICES ARE STEEPED
IN A SENSE OF BETRAYAL,

30:09.500 --> 30:12.230
SO HIS CURE FEELS MORE LIKE
A TEENAGER'S REVENGE FANTASY.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.079
MORE THAN THAT, THE UNSUB
SINCERELY BELIEVES

30:14.110 --> 30:16.874
THAT HE CAN OUTSMART LAW
ENFORCEMENT BY MISLEADING THEM.

30:16.910 --> 30:19.845
SO THIS ASCLEPIUS ISN'T
SOME SORT OF ALTER EGO,
IT'S PURE CHARADE.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.609
AND THE VICTIMS WEREN'T JUST
SELECTED AS SURROGATES,

30:21.650 --> 30:23.470
THEY WERE CHOSEN
SO THAT HIS ONE TRUE TARGET

30:23.520 --> 30:25.488
WOULD SIMPLY GET LOST
IN THE BODY COUNT.

30:25.520 --> 30:28.614
SO YOU'RE THINKING
NOT ONLY IS SCOTT TAVERAS
THE ONE TRUE TARGET,

30:28.660 --> 30:30.582
BUT THAT ONE OR BOTH
OF HIS CHILDREN

30:30.620 --> 30:31.951
ARE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE MURDERS.

30:31.990 --> 30:33.321
HIS SON RAFAEL
FITS THE PROFILE.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.952
GARCIA: DISCIPLINARY
PROBLEMS LED TO HIM

30:35.000 --> 30:36.456
BEING ENROLLED
IN A MILITARY
BOARDING SCHOOL.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.229
AFTER THAT THERE
WAS A BRIEF STINT
IN THE ARMY,

30:38.270 --> 30:40.465
FOLLOWED BY AN OTHER-THAN-
HONORABLE DISCHARGE.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.092
REID: AND WHILE THERE,
HE RECEIVED TRAINING

30:42.140 --> 30:43.562
TO BECOME AN ELECTRONIC
WARFARE OFFICER,

30:43.600 --> 30:45.067
WHICH IS HOW HE ACQUIRED
HIS SKILL SETS.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.979
SO MAYBE SCOTT'S SON
WASN'T AS COMFORTABLE

30:49.010 --> 30:51.240
WITH HIS FATHER'S
NEW RELATIONSHIP
AS EVERYONE THINKS.

30:51.280 --> 30:53.646
NOT AT ALL, AND I THINK
HIS NOTIONS OF DISEASE AND CURE

30:53.680 --> 30:56.217
VERY LIKELY STEM FROM
HIS OWN MOTHER'S
BATTLE WITH CANCER.

30:56.250 --> 30:57.569
OK, I'LL COORDINATE
WITH LIEUTENANT WILSON.

30:57.620 --> 30:59.144
WE'LL BRING RAFAEL
IN RIGHT NOW.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.988
WHEN DO THE DOCTORS
THINK DAD WILL
BE ABLE TO GO HOME?

31:02.020 --> 31:06.127
PRETTY SOON, ACTUALLY.
THEY SAID MAYBE THE DAY
AFTER TOMORROW.

31:06.160 --> 31:08.526
SO HOW LONG YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA BE IN THERE WITH HIM?

31:12.970 --> 31:15.291
YOU REALLY ARE
STRONG LIKE BULL.

31:20.240 --> 31:22.174
I MUST LOOK
A LOT BETTER THAN I FEEL.

31:22.210 --> 31:24.098
YOU LOOK GOOD, BABY.

31:26.310 --> 31:29.074
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.509
I REALLY THOUGHT
I'D LOST YOU.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.611
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING BEFORE I GO?

31:37.660 --> 31:40.151
NO. I'M FINE.

31:40.190 --> 31:41.555
WELL,
I'LL BE BACK LATER.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.693
SO YOU SPEND SOME
TIME WITH YOUR KIDS,

31:43.730 --> 31:46.927
AND THEN YOU GET SOME REST.

31:46.970 --> 31:48.938
YES, MA'AM.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.554
HEY, MOM, I'M GONNA
GO OUTSIDE REAL QUICK,
HAVE A SMOKE, OK?

32:13.590 --> 32:16.718
YOU PROMISED ME
YOU WERE GONNA QUIT.

32:16.760 --> 32:19.923
SOON, MAMA. SOON.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.430
NO ONE SAW ANYTHING,
BUT WE CAN'T FIND
RAFAEL ANYWHERE

32:59.470 --> 33:01.370
AND ELENA'S NOT
ANSWERING HER CELL PHONE.

33:01.410 --> 33:03.207
ALL WE HAVE IS THAT
FOOTAGE GARCIA FOUND

33:03.240 --> 33:07.347
OF DURAN'S VEHICLE
HIGHTAILING IT
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

33:07.380 --> 33:10.645
HOLD UP. I GOT HIM.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.046
MATT, JJ, ABOUT
A QUARTER MILE UP,

33:13.090 --> 33:14.284
MAKE A RIGHT TURN
ON BELLEVUE.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.981
COPY THAT.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.452
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

33:18.490 --> 33:19.718
WHERE IS MY SON?

33:19.760 --> 33:21.022
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
WE'D LIKE TO KNOW.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.322
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

33:22.360 --> 33:23.691
JUST A FEW MINUTES AGO.
WE WERE UPSTAIRS.

33:23.730 --> 33:25.618
HE SAID HE WAS GOING OUTSIDE
TO GRAB A CIGARETTE.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.537
WAS HE WITH MS. DURAN
OR WAS HE FOLLOWING
HER OUTSIDE--

33:28.570 --> 33:29.639
HEY--YOU'RE ASKING THAT
LIKE YOU THINK

33:29.670 --> 33:31.433
MY BROTHER
DID SOMETHING HERE.

33:31.470 --> 33:34.303
LOOK, MA'AM, I'M SORRY,
BUT RAFAEL IS A PERSON
OF INTEREST

33:34.340 --> 33:36.274
IN THIS INVESTIGATION,
AND WE'RE GOING
TO NEED YOUR HELP

33:36.310 --> 33:38.175
IN ORDER TO FIND HIM.

33:38.210 --> 33:40.371
REID:
RAFAEL METICULOUSLY
PLANNED HIS CURE.

33:40.410 --> 33:43.117
THE RUSE WAS INTENDED
TO BE THE ULTIMATE
FORENSIC COUNTERMEASURE.

33:43.150 --> 33:46.313
SO EVEN AS HE DEVOLVES,
HE'LL TRY AS HARD AS HE CAN
TO MAINTAIN IT,

33:46.350 --> 33:48.580
WHICH MEANS HE CAN'T TAKE
ELENA DURAN ANYWHERE

33:48.620 --> 33:50.508
THAT WOULD BE
LINKED TO HIM.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.421
GARCIA,
WHAT DO YOU SEE AHEAD?

33:54.460 --> 33:57.588
UH, NOTHING. NADA.

33:57.630 --> 34:00.064
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
I JUST HAD HIM.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.796
HE CAN'T CLOAK.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.728
I GOT HIM. I GOT HIM.
I FOUND ELENA'S CAR.

34:04.770 --> 34:06.237
WHERE?

34:06.270 --> 34:07.567
UH, INSIDE THE MCKENNA
INDUSTRIAL PARK.

34:07.610 --> 34:08.770
I'M SENDING THE ADDRESS
RIGHT NOW.

34:15.550 --> 34:17.313
THE CAR'S CLEAR.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.754
YOU GOT A PICK?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.639
SO NOT ONLY IS RAFAEL
TAVERAS ALIVE,

34:47.680 --> 34:49.113
HE IS COMPLETELY
UNINJURED.

34:49.150 --> 34:50.572
THE BLOOD ON HIM
WAS ELENA DURAN'S.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.383
DO WE THINK
SHE'S STILL ALIVE?

34:52.420 --> 34:54.786
WELL, THE FORENSIC REPORT
SAYS THAT THERE'S NO INDICATION

34:54.820 --> 34:57.618
OF ARTERIAL SPRAY,
NOR DO THE STAINS
OF RAFAEL'S CLOTHES

34:57.660 --> 34:59.628
SUGGEST A LETHAL
LOSS OF BLOOD.

34:59.660 --> 35:01.753
ALVEZ:
WELL, MATT AND I STARTED
SKETCHING OUT A GEO-PROFILE

35:01.800 --> 35:04.166
OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA,
AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT

35:04.200 --> 35:05.724
THE TIME BETWEEN
ELENA'S ABDUCT ION

35:05.770 --> 35:07.419
AND RAFAEL'S APPREHENSION,

35:07.470 --> 35:09.461
HE REALLY COULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN HER VERY FAR.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.535
ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE
LOOKING AT ROUGHLY

35:10.570 --> 35:12.208
A 4 1/2-SQUARE-MILE AREA

35:12.240 --> 35:14.401
WITH THE HOSPITAL
AT THE CENTER.

35:14.440 --> 35:15.873
LEWIS: BUT AN AREA
JUST BIG ENOUGH

35:15.910 --> 35:17.468
THAT EVEN IF WE WERE
TO GO DOOR TO DOOR,

35:17.510 --> 35:19.398
IT COULD TAKE US DAYS
TO FIND HER.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.918
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT. SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
VERY, VERY HURT.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.214
WHAT IF WE DON'T
HAVE TIME?

35:24.250 --> 35:26.218
ROSSI: WHAT'S RAFAEL
SAYING

35:26.250 --> 35:28.787
PRENTISS:
YEAH, HE IS. AND HE'S
ADAMANTLY MAINTAINING

35:28.820 --> 35:30.185
THAT HE'S ANOTHER VICTIM.

35:30.220 --> 35:31.528
HE CLAIMS HE WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT ELENA,

35:31.560 --> 35:33.448
THAT HE STRUGGLED
WITH A MASKED ASSAILANT

35:33.490 --> 35:35.651
WHO OVERPOWERED HIM
AND THREW HIM IN THE TRUNK.

35:35.700 --> 35:38.567
YOU KNOW, RAFAEL'S
NARCISSISTIC DRIVE TOWARDS
SELF-PRESERVATION

35:39.870 --> 35:41.292
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

35:41.340 --> 35:42.830
JJ: ELENA DURAN
IS THE ONLY VICTIM

35:42.870 --> 35:44.428
THAT WE CAN CONNECT
DIRECTLY TO HIM,

35:44.470 --> 35:45.698
AND HE KNOWS THAT.

35:45.740 --> 35:47.332
SO THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE
RAFAEL THINKS

35:47.370 --> 35:48.837
THAT HE COULD GET AWAY
WITH HIDING HER

35:48.880 --> 35:50.575
UNTIL THE HEAT ON HIM COOLED.

35:50.610 --> 35:52.749
HIS CURE
HAS TO BE SUSTAINED,

35:52.780 --> 35:56.443
LIKE A COVER STORY
YOU NEED FOR A COVERT OP.

35:56.480 --> 35:58.710
AND I KNOW ABOUT THAT.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.240
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

36:00.290 --> 36:02.485
YOU AND MATT.

36:08.900 --> 36:11.721
HEY, I DON'T APPRECIATE
BEING TREATED LIKE
SOME CRIMINAL HERE.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.466
OK, I TOLD THE POLICE
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.639
I TRIED TO HELP ELENA.
I SWEAR I DID.

36:16.670 --> 36:18.661
WE KNOW YOU DID, RAFAEL.

36:18.710 --> 36:21.235
YOU'RE LUCKY
TO BE ALIVE RIGHT NOW.

36:21.280 --> 36:23.976
THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST
DANGEROUS ASSAILANT

36:24.010 --> 36:25.648
WE'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.342
HE'S ALSO BY FAR
THE SMARTEST.

36:28.380 --> 36:30.439
BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL
THAT WITH YOUR HELP

36:30.480 --> 36:31.811
WE'LL BE ABLE
TO RESCUE ELENA.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.841
WE KNOW HOW MUCH
SHE MEANS TO YOUR FATHER

36:33.890 --> 36:36.211
AND HOW THEY HOPE
TO GET MARRIED,

36:36.260 --> 36:37.750
NOW THAT YOUR MOM'S
FEELING BETTER

36:37.790 --> 36:39.382
AND THEIR DIVORCE
CAN BE FINALIZED.

36:39.430 --> 36:41.398
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
HE'D HOPED FOR.

36:45.970 --> 36:47.369
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN YOUR MOM

36:47.400 --> 36:50.494
WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER?

36:50.540 --> 36:51.768
OF COURSE I DO.
WHAT THE HELL

36:51.810 --> 36:52.936
DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

36:52.970 --> 36:54.278
MATT: RAFAEL, WE HAVE
REASON TO BELIEVE

36:54.310 --> 36:55.538
THAT YOUR FATHER
WAS TARGETED

36:55.580 --> 36:58.242
BECAUSE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH ELENA DURAN.

36:58.280 --> 37:00.373
SO IT'S IMPORTANT
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

37:00.410 --> 37:02.947
ALL OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES
SURROUNDING HOW
THE TWO OF THEM MET

37:02.980 --> 37:04.709
AND GOT CLOSE.

37:04.750 --> 37:08.481
YEAH, WELL,
ASK MY DAD ABOUT THAT.

37:08.520 --> 37:09.748
OK.

37:11.830 --> 37:15.391
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOUR DAD LIED

37:15.430 --> 37:18.399
ABOUT WHEN HE STARTED
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH ELENA,

37:18.430 --> 37:20.898
THAT MAYBE HE STARTED
SEEING HER

37:20.930 --> 37:24.263
BEFORE HE SEPARATED
FROM YOUR MOM?

37:24.310 --> 37:25.402
I DON'T KNOW.

37:25.440 --> 37:27.533
DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM
SUSPECT ED THAT?

37:30.040 --> 37:34.044
MY MOTHER NEVER
SUSPECTED ANYTHING.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.571
BUT HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT WOULD MAKE HER FEEL?

37:36.620 --> 37:38.281
HOW WOULD THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

37:38.320 --> 37:39.639
H EARTBROKEN.

37:39.690 --> 37:42.056
NO.

37:42.090 --> 37:43.751
NOT MY MOTHER.

37:44.930 --> 37:48.559
MY MOM IS THE STRONGEST
WOMAN I KNOW.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.329
SO STRONG.

37:57.870 --> 38:00.634
AND MY DAD...

38:03.040 --> 38:06.441
HE JUST PULLS ME
ASIDE AND HE...

38:08.550 --> 38:09.710
MY MOTHER'S ILLNESS
HAS ON HIM,

38:09.750 --> 38:11.843
AND I'M JUST LIKE,

38:11.890 --> 38:14.609
"WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

38:14.660 --> 38:17.914
SHE'S THE ONE
WHO'S DYING!"

38:17.960 --> 38:19.655
HOW DID THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

38:19.690 --> 38:22.727
LIKE KILLING HIM
WITH MY BARE HANDS.

38:22.760 --> 38:25.968
JJ: RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED
THAT HEARTLESS BASTARD,

38:26.000 --> 38:30.391
BECAUSE HE IS THE DISEASE
AND YOU ARE THE CURE.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.104
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,

38:35.140 --> 38:38.678
IF YOU KILL YOUR DAD,

38:38.710 --> 38:40.348
YOU'RE SUSPECT NUMBER ONE.

38:40.380 --> 38:42.348
JJ: AND THEN WHO'S GONNA
LOOK AFTER YOUR MOM?

38:42.380 --> 38:43.813
YOUR SISTER

38:43.850 --> 38:46.944
SIMMONS: NO. SO YOU GOTTA
COVER UP YOUR TRACKS.

38:46.990 --> 38:48.878
JJ: AND YOU DID
EVERYTHING RIGHT.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.751
YOU DID.
YOU DID EVERYTHING RIGHT,

38:50.790 --> 38:54.726
EXCEPT KILLING
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.524
THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FATHER,

38:57.560 --> 38:58.959
BUT YOU LOST YOUR
CHANCE TO KILL HIM

38:59.000 --> 39:01.127
AND NOW YOU JUST--
YOU WANT TO SEE HIM HURT.

39:01.170 --> 39:03.832
I GET IT. I GET IT.

39:03.870 --> 39:07.704
BUT ELENA IS INNOCENT,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.503
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU NEED TO TELL US

39:09.540 --> 39:12.043
WHERE SHE IS RIGHT NOW.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.811
HER BLOOD...

39:18.850 --> 39:20.681
THAT'S ON HIS HANDS.

39:24.090 --> 39:25.580
NOT MINE.

39:25.630 --> 39:26.824
OH, NO.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.555
WE'RE TOO LATE.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.920
THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE THIS RIGHT

39:31.970 --> 39:34.120
IS FOR YOU TO TELL US
WHERE SHE IS.

39:38.570 --> 39:40.663
I USED TO WORK
PART-TIME SECURITY

39:40.710 --> 39:44.441
AT A DISTRIBUTION CENTER
IN IW CITY.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.107
AND THERE'S AN UNDERGROUND
STOCKROOM THERE

39:46.150 --> 39:47.902
THAT NO ONE'S USING.

40:17.010 --> 40:22.175
MAN: * WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, MERCY *

40:24.620 --> 40:30.513
* WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, MERCY

40:37.900 --> 40:42.997
* WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, MERCY...

40:43.040 --> 40:45.463
IT NEVER DOES
GET ANY EASIER--

40:45.510 --> 40:47.728
OUTCOMES LIKE THIS ONE.

40:47.770 --> 40:50.500
NO, IT DOESN'T.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.577
AND IT ALSO HAS A WAY
OF DREDGING UP THE PAST

40:53.610 --> 40:56.215
YOU THOUGHT
YOU HAD LOCKED AWAY.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.617
THE "WHAT IFS"
AND "IF ONLYS."

41:01.660 --> 41:03.252
I KNOW THERE ARE
PARTS OF THIS JOB

41:03.290 --> 41:06.623
THAT YOU REALLY
CAN'T TAKE HOME.

41:06.660 --> 41:09.527
SO IF YOU EVER WANT
SOMEONE TO TALK TO,

41:09.560 --> 41:12.063
KNOW THAT I AM
ALWAYS HERE FOR YOU.

41:13.970 --> 41:15.096
THAN KS.

41:15.140 --> 41:19.258
* TAKE MY HAND
AND LEAD ME ON *

41:19.310 --> 41:22.632
* THE PROMISED LAND
YOUR *

41:27.080 --> 41:28.638
YOU'RE NOT GOING DOWN?

41:28.680 --> 41:31.046
I--I HAVE TO GO UP,
ACTUALLY.

41:31.080 --> 41:34.652
OH, RIGHT. YOU'RE
MEETING WITH BARNES.

41:34.690 --> 41:36.783
SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

41:36.820 --> 41:38.754
NOT AS LONG
AS I'M IN CHARGE.

41:38.790 --> 41:42.658
* OH, MERCY

41:42.700 --> 41:47.967
* WILL YOU COME FOR ME?

41:52.710 --> 41:55.702
GOOD EVENING, AGENT JAREAU.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.105
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
BARN ES.

41:57.140 --> 41:58.676
I'M SORRY FOR
THE SUDDEN URGENCY

41:58.710 --> 41:59.938
IN HAVING TO MEET
TONIGHT.

41:59.980 --> 42:01.618
HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE
IMMEDIATELY,

42:01.650 --> 42:02.969
SSA EMILY PRENTISS
WILL BE PLACED

42:03.020 --> 42:05.818
ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE
PENDING AN INTERNAL REVIEW.

42:05.850 --> 42:10.184
AND SO YOU WILL BE
THE ACTING UNIT CHIEF
OF THE BAU.

42:10.220 --> 42:12.051
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

42:12.090 --> 42:13.955
IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
LEAVING YOUR CELL PHONE
OUT HERE,

42:13.990 --> 42:16.049
WE CAN TALK IN MY OFFICE.

42:48.160 --> 42:50.128
