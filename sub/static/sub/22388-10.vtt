ANNOUNCER: <i>From the Penn &amp; Teller Theater</i>
<i>in Las Vegas, Nevada,</i>

00:24.567 --> 00:27.600
<i>here's our host, Jonathan Ross!</i>

00:28.233 --> 00:29.700
Thank you very much.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.133
Wow, thank you so much.
You're very kind.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.867
Thank you so much.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.567
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:35.633 --> 00:36.967
Thank you.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.133
Welcome to <i>Penn &amp; Teller Fool Us,</i>

00:41.200 --> 00:43.833
where Penn and Teller sit
in the Penn &amp; Teller Theater

00:44.067 --> 00:45.900
on the Penn and Teller show
that's named after them

00:45.967 --> 00:48.567
where acts come out and try
and stump Penn and Teller for a chance

00:48.633 --> 00:50.767
to come back here and perform
with Penn and Teller.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.633
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:53.400 --> 00:55.100
Wait until you see what
we have in store for you tonight,

00:55.167 --> 00:56.900
but first, let me bring out
the stars of the show,

00:56.967 --> 00:59.267
I can't remember if I mentioned
their name, but here they are,

00:59.467 --> 01:00.600
Penn and Teller.

01:00.667 --> 01:02.500
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:07.700 --> 01:09.300
Lovely to see you again.

01:09.433 --> 01:10.867
Penn, glad to see you here.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.967
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:16.233 --> 01:17.600
Gentlemen, if you'd like to
take your chairs,

01:17.667 --> 01:18.867
the show can get started.

01:18.933 --> 01:20.400
Penn and Teller, ladies and gentlemen.

01:20.467 --> 01:22.267
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

01:31.200 --> 01:34.000
It's always a treat to have
Penn and Teller here.

01:34.067 --> 01:35.400
Now if you're wearing socks,

01:35.467 --> 01:38.233
hold on to them because here
comes our first potential fooler.

01:43.200 --> 01:44.433
(LAUGHS)

01:45.733 --> 01:47.633
Okay, so I'm Joel Meyers
and this is Spidey.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.267
<i>He's like the brother I never wanted.</i>

01:49.333 --> 01:51.467
I put up with Joel 'cause
he's good at magic.

01:52.267 --> 01:53.433
When you tell someone you're a magician,

01:53.500 --> 01:54.600
one of the things they're gonna
ask you is,

01:54.700 --> 01:56.233
"Can you pull a coin out of my ear?"

01:56.300 --> 01:59.400
-And you would think that...
-That's... My ring.

02:00.267 --> 02:02.633
SPIDEY: <i>As comfortable as most people</i>
<i>are at walking and talking,</i>

02:02.933 --> 02:05.067
<i>I see that level of comfort in</i>
<i>Joel when he's doing magic.</i>

02:05.133 --> 02:06.300
<i>It's just second nature to him.</i>

02:06.367 --> 02:09.067
You put a deck of cards in his hand,
magic is going to happen.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.900
Look, over your head, watch.

02:10.967 --> 02:12.667
-(COUGHING)
-Look, look, look.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.233
Look, he's coughing. Look.

02:14.300 --> 02:15.600
I hate it when you do that.
What is this?

02:15.667 --> 02:17.300
Look at this, watch this.
What is this?

02:17.367 --> 02:19.567
In his mouth.
Did you see that?

02:19.633 --> 02:20.700
Dude, I hate it when you do that.

02:20.767 --> 02:21.967
Dude, I told you don't do that.

02:22.033 --> 02:24.467
JOEL: <i>I couldn't think of anybody better</i>
<i>to be doing this show with.</i>

02:24.933 --> 02:29.500
Spidey has fooled me with so many things,
it blows my mind.

02:29.933 --> 02:31.167
God, that was hard to say.

02:31.233 --> 02:32.567
(LAUGHTER)

02:33.300 --> 02:34.667
(APPLAUSE)

02:37.500 --> 02:40.667
In our next duo, one guy specializes
in sleight of hand,

02:40.733 --> 02:41.900
the other is a mentalist.

02:41.967 --> 02:43.667
Together they're slightly mental.

02:43.733 --> 02:45.500
Please welcome Joel Meyers and Spidey.

02:45.567 --> 02:47.367
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

02:51.367 --> 02:53.767
What's up, guys?
My name is Joel Meyers, and tonight,

02:53.833 --> 02:56.633
we are going to tell you about something
called mentalism.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.333
Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.

02:58.400 --> 02:59.967
My name is Spidey, and I'm a mentalist,

03:00.100 --> 03:01.733
which means I can read your mind.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.000
No, he can't.

03:03.067 --> 03:05.867
In a moment, I'm gonna do something
for you guys using this ordinary book.

03:05.933 --> 03:07.033
Stop.

03:07.200 --> 03:08.533
See, now why would he say that?
Ordinary book?

03:08.600 --> 03:09.967
Why would anybody say that?

03:10.567 --> 03:12.833
We didn't think it was an
unordinary book before, but now we do.

03:13.267 --> 03:14.433
Go ahead.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.433
And actually to do this,
I'm gonna borrow Mr. Ross.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.767
So, Mr. Ross, if you can make
your way over here.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.633
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's make some noise.

03:20.600 --> 03:21.933
Thanks for being here.

03:23.567 --> 03:25.167
Mr. Ross, I'm gonna flip through
the pages of this book.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.867
I want you to say the word
stop whenever you like.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.767
Make sure I stop when you say it.

03:28.833 --> 03:29.933
-Stop.
-Right there, can you see

03:30.000 --> 03:31.433
-the first word on that page?
-I can.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.000
The first word, just lock
that in your mind.

03:33.067 --> 03:34.467
-Boom.
-Here we go.

03:34.733 --> 03:35.867
(INHALES DEEPLY)

03:35.933 --> 03:37.000
Wow.

03:37.733 --> 03:38.833
What's happening right now?

03:38.900 --> 03:41.700
Why does every mentalist and
magician insist

03:42.167 --> 03:44.600
on doing this weird heavy breathing
as they pretend to harness

03:44.667 --> 03:46.067
their magical powers?

03:47.567 --> 03:50.167
Really, at the end of the day, at least
this guy's not involving you in it.

03:50.233 --> 03:51.400
Put your hand on my forehead.

03:51.467 --> 03:53.133
Breathe with me.
Breathe with me, up and down.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.733
Yes, yes, yes, breathe. Send it to me,
send it to me, send it to me.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.700
Good, good, good, good, yes.
Lock it in your mind.

03:57.833 --> 03:59.167
Think of it.
Send it to me, send it to me.

03:59.233 --> 04:00.433
-Yes, yes.
-Send it to me, yes.

04:00.500 --> 04:03.067
-Focus, focus.
-After a ridiculous amount of time

04:03.133 --> 04:06.533
and an even more ridiculous
amount of horrible acting,

04:07.367 --> 04:08.733
not you, you're good,

04:10.500 --> 04:13.100
the mentalist finally reveals
the chosen word.

04:13.567 --> 04:15.067
For the very first time, Mr. Ross,

04:15.133 --> 04:16.200
what was the word you were thinking?

04:16.267 --> 04:17.632
It was "curiously."

04:17.700 --> 04:18.833
-Curiously?
-Yes.

04:18.899 --> 04:21.200
-Ladies and gentlemen, curiously.
-Wow, that was good.

04:21.399 --> 04:22.833
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Ross.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.333
Go head back to your place.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.200
Thank you so much.
Thanks.

04:26.867 --> 04:27.967
-Yes.
-No.

04:28.033 --> 04:29.233
-No? Why?
-No.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.333
Come on, man, that was ridiculous.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.433
First of all, I mean, if we're
really gonna impress these people,

04:32.500 --> 04:33.833
what is this book?

04:33.900 --> 04:35.900
Nobody's even heard...
<i>Instant Intuition.</i>

04:36.167 --> 04:38.833
Nobody's even heard of this book.
If we're going to impress these people,

04:38.900 --> 04:40.667
we got to use a book
that everybody here would know.

04:40.933 --> 04:43.000
-Where are we going to get that?
-Funny thing you should ask.

04:44.167 --> 04:47.167
I just happened to bring
a couple of random books with me.

04:47.233 --> 04:49.233
The classics, you guys, the classics.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.733
Six random books.
Books like <i>The Secret Garden,</i>

04:51.800 --> 04:53.100
<i>Frankenstein, Dracula,</i>

04:53.167 --> 04:56.467
like <i>Twilight,</i> but better,
<i>Robinson Crusoe,</i>

04:56.533 --> 04:58.000
<i>Treasure Island,</i> all the good ones.

04:58.067 --> 05:01.200
Also, I think we need to have
a random page number selected.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.767
A page number totally at random.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.000
We could do that, sure.

05:04.067 --> 05:05.633
Sir, over here in the front,
if you could just stand up.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.033
You don't have to come up,
just right there is fine.

05:07.133 --> 05:08.167
-What is your name?
-Patrick.

05:08.233 --> 05:09.367
Patrick.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.667
I guess most of those books
have about 200 pages.

05:11.733 --> 05:14.067
Think of any number between
1 and 200, that's the page we'll use.

05:14.133 --> 05:15.667
-Think of one. Do you have one?
-Yep.

05:15.733 --> 05:19.000
And in fact, we're gonna show
this to someone in a moment,

05:19.067 --> 05:21.100
so go ahead and write it down
right there in the circle.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.367
Make sure I can't see it.
Just like that, and...

05:23.433 --> 05:25.767
Also I think we need to find
somebody else that's totally at random,

05:25.833 --> 05:27.167
like a completely random spectator.

05:27.233 --> 05:28.633
-'Cause we don't know him.
-Sure.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.100
He could be anybody.
Somebody totally at random.

05:31.167 --> 05:32.200
So, Patrick, do me a favor.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.167
Rip out the post-it,
make sure I still can't see it.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.967
Fold it in four.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.633
Good.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.067
And just pass it to
the person behind you,

05:40.133 --> 05:41.533
-the gentleman behind you. Yeah.
-That's a good idea.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.967
And then let's keep it moving.
Keep it passing. Left, right.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.833
Keep it going, keep it going.
Left, right, back, front, whatever.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.467
-Keep it going.
-Make it totally random.

05:48.533 --> 05:50.567
-Keep it going, keep it going.
-And stop, stop right there.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.167
What is your name?
Please stand up.

05:52.367 --> 05:53.400
Sam.

05:53.467 --> 05:54.533
Sam, here's the deal.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.000
We have six books over here.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.067
Six books.
We want to pick a random book.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.267
We want you to pick
that random book, okay?

06:00.333 --> 06:02.667
So I want you to name any number
between one and six for me.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.533
-Four.
-Four. One, two, three, four.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.433
<i>Robinson Crusoe,</i> cool.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.333
Now also, Spidey, I think to
make this even more impressive,

06:09.400 --> 06:11.933
I think you should write down,
like, your prediction ahead of time.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.233
-Yeah, I can do that, sure.
-Cool.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.967
Sam, I'm gonna bring this book
to you, is that cool?

06:15.033 --> 06:16.400
-Yeah, that's great.
-So as I'm doing this, go ahead

06:16.467 --> 06:17.500
and start unfolding that piece of paper.

06:17.567 --> 06:18.767
Make sure I don't see it though.

06:18.833 --> 06:21.633
Look at the page number that
Patrick wrote down, okay?

06:21.700 --> 06:24.200
Sam, take the book.
I'm gonna stand back so I can't see it.

06:24.267 --> 06:25.400
Sam, here's what I want you to do.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.433
I want you to open up that
little piece of paper

06:27.500 --> 06:30.067
with the page number
on it and then turn to that

06:30.133 --> 06:31.867
page number in the book.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.467
And as soon as you do that,
let me know you've done it.

06:34.533 --> 06:35.533
-I've done it.
-You're good?

06:35.700 --> 06:37.400
Okay, cool.
Spidey, you got a prediction?

06:37.467 --> 06:40.067
Yeah, I do have something.
I just, you know,

06:40.300 --> 06:41.933
I feel like we should have
something safe to put it in,

06:42.000 --> 06:43.300
like an envelope or something.

06:43.367 --> 06:45.333
What? Magic exists.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.800
Sorry, that was awkward.

06:47.867 --> 06:48.967
Okay, all right.

06:49.033 --> 06:51.033
-So we're gonna open this up.
-I don't want to even see that.

06:51.100 --> 06:53.067
Yes, and I'll seal it up.

06:53.133 --> 06:54.333
It's a peel and seal.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.667
Sam, are you at the correct page?

06:56.733 --> 06:57.967
I am at the correct page.

06:58.033 --> 07:00.300
Please have a look at that top line,
first word of that line.

07:00.367 --> 07:03.433
If I did this correctly, I feel like
the first word of that line,

07:04.500 --> 07:06.900
it's a very short word.
Maybe four, maybe five letters.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.100
-Four letters, yes?
-Correct.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.167
Correct, and then there's a
shorter word after that.

07:11.233 --> 07:14.133
It's the third one I'm interested in.
I feel like that's a little bit longer.

07:14.233 --> 07:15.467
There's a V in that word.

07:15.533 --> 07:17.333
-Yes.
-Starts with a V.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.467
There's a T.
No T?

07:19.533 --> 07:21.400
Dude, what are you doing?
If you know the word, just tell us.

07:21.467 --> 07:22.733
Why are you just fishing for letters?

07:22.800 --> 07:25.067
-If you know the word, tell us what it is.
-I don't know the word.

07:25.133 --> 07:27.000
(MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY)

07:27.567 --> 07:29.767
What. Then what did you write
down on your prediction?

07:29.867 --> 07:32.200
It's, like, a guess.
Kind of like a guesstimate type thing.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.067
You, you guessed?

07:34.167 --> 07:36.133
We're on national TV, and you,
dude, are you serious?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.600
You guessed the word.

07:38.567 --> 07:40.200
Hold on, guys. Okay, so, Sam,

07:40.333 --> 07:43.233
the word that you're thinking of,

07:43.300 --> 07:46.633
is that word... Dictionary?

07:47.067 --> 07:48.467
-It is not.
-No, Joel, it's not...

07:48.533 --> 07:50.100
You had your chance.
Is it dictionary?

07:50.167 --> 07:51.600
Is it, like, <i>Pictionary</i>
or something that rhymes?

07:51.667 --> 07:53.000
Joel, the word isn't dictionary.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.067
I was saying the word is
in the dictionary.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.033
(LAUGHTER)

08:00.333 --> 08:02.300
Dude, every word is in
the dictionary, genius.

08:02.467 --> 08:04.267
That's why I wrote something
on the back, genius.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.033
Turn it around, look, show them.
There's a number.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.567
Yeah, show, show.

08:07.633 --> 08:09.533
Three, six, three, one, one.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.900
It's a code.
It's a code.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.000
What is the word?

08:13.067 --> 08:14.467
-Voyage.
-Voyage.

08:14.533 --> 08:17.233
Mr. Jillette, there is a dictionary
on your table next to you.

08:17.300 --> 08:18.933
-There is.
-Can you do me the favor?

08:19.000 --> 08:20.867
It says three, sixty-three, one, one.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.967
Can you please flip to page 363?

08:24.100 --> 08:25.867
-363?
-It's 363.

08:25.933 --> 08:27.467
Then it says one.

08:27.533 --> 08:30.633
That means we're gonna be using the first
column on page 363 of two columns.

08:30.700 --> 08:33.067
-Yeah, I got that.
-First line at the top.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.500
-I got that.
-Now hold that for a sec. Do not say

08:34.567 --> 08:35.866
-it quite yet.
-I won't.

08:37.067 --> 08:39.799
You went to a random page,
selected at random.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.033
It was a random book.

08:41.100 --> 08:44.533
You were selected at random,
and the word was voyage.

08:44.700 --> 08:48.267
Mr. Jillette, page 363, first column,
first word, please.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.833
It's a noun or a verb.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.900
It's a journey by ship.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.167
The accent's on the first syllable.

08:55.233 --> 08:57.300
-It's voyage.
-Yes, that was good.

08:57.367 --> 08:58.433
Yes!

08:58.500 --> 09:00.167
That works.
Thank you so much.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.033
Joel Meyers and Spidey,
ladies and gentlemen.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.300
Let's hear it for them.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.767
Great job.
Very impressive.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.200
And very funny as well.

09:08.267 --> 09:10.267
Now you know how this works.
Penn and Teller are sitting there.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.800
They're thinking about it.
Teller's got his book out.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.033
They're going to be
writing down their ideas.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.500
To see if they know how it happened.

09:14.733 --> 09:17.233
When did you guys get together
because you weren't always

09:17.300 --> 09:18.400
performing as a duo, were you?

09:18.467 --> 09:21.600
No, we met, we met, like,
three or four years ago,

09:21.667 --> 09:24.433
and literally just became
really close friends.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.067
We have so many things in common,

09:26.133 --> 09:27.900
and then at the same time,
we're completely

09:28.000 --> 09:30.433
opposite and drive each other nuts
in so many ways.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.367
But yeah, we met just a few
years ago, and so...

09:32.433 --> 09:33.433
And you still carry on working separately

09:33.500 --> 09:34.500
as well though even though...

09:34.567 --> 09:35.933
Yeah, we're individual performers, yeah.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.767
We do a bit of both.
We wanted to tackle this together

09:37.833 --> 09:40.767
because I really enjoy
mentalism very much,

09:40.833 --> 09:43.800
but Joel has a huge appreciation
for what Penn and Teller do,

09:43.867 --> 09:46.567
and he's a huge fan,
and so he was able to take

09:46.633 --> 09:48.433
the mentalism effect and make it
more fun, and sort of be,

09:48.500 --> 09:50.633
like, let's give them something
that they're gonna appreciate.

09:50.700 --> 09:55.200
Okay, it looks to me like Penn and Teller
have finished their deliberations,

09:55.267 --> 09:58.200
so we'll find out what they thought
and whether they know what you did.

09:58.433 --> 09:59.767
Gentlemen.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.200
Okay, boy, we like two-person teams.

10:03.867 --> 10:08.800
And also, I love the doing a
trick and then commenting on it

10:09.167 --> 10:11.033
while you're doing it. I just love.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.900
I love that busting
of psychics while you're doing

10:14.167 --> 10:15.800
an amazing psychic thing.

10:15.867 --> 10:20.067
You know, the interesting thing
about, about the two of us

10:20.133 --> 10:23.400
is we have a lot of information
on this 'cause I have, I happen

10:23.467 --> 10:28.167
to have a magnifying glass
just like this at home.

10:28.533 --> 10:31.267
Which I thought was quite a coincidence.

10:31.333 --> 10:35.400
And Teller has a pen
exactly like the pen

10:35.700 --> 10:39.667
that fellow used to write down the number,
which is also a surprising coincidence.

10:39.733 --> 10:42.900
And I would have the magnifying
glass and Teller would have the pen.

10:42.967 --> 10:46.800
The other thing that's odd about
this trick is that you use paper books.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.367
Damnedest thing.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.367
When was the Gutenberg press?

10:50.433 --> 10:52.500
Gutenberg press was the
17th century, right?

10:53.100 --> 10:56.600
Earlier. 16th ce...
And yet, for all that time,

10:56.767 --> 10:58.967
you still couldn't
have done this trick except

10:59.033 --> 11:00.700
for the past 10 or 15 years.

11:00.967 --> 11:06.233
And I have this magnifying glass and
Teller has the exact same pen you used.

11:06.500 --> 11:10.133
So I think you're fairly confident
they know what you were doing.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.333
I think a pair of, a pair of
magicians just got schooled by

11:14.400 --> 11:15.800
a more seasoned pair of magicians.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.000
(LAUGHTER)

11:17.067 --> 11:18.533
You know, I think you guys
came here wanting

11:18.600 --> 11:20.700
to give us a good show, do you?
I think that was the main reason.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.200
And you did that. It was a great show,
wasn't it, ladies and gentlemen?

11:23.300 --> 11:26.233
They didn't fool them, but we had
a great time watching you work.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.433
Ladies and gentlemen,
Joel Meyers and Spidey.

11:29.733 --> 11:31.067
Take care, guys.

11:34.133 --> 11:35.267
What's this behind my ear?

11:35.333 --> 11:37.200
Oh, it's just our next potential fooler.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.333
<i>My name is Rick Lax,</i>
<i>and I invent magic tricks.</i>

11:43.400 --> 11:46.167
When you see a magician
do a magic trick,

11:46.533 --> 11:48.000
<i>they probably didn't think of it,</i>

11:48.300 --> 11:49.333
I did.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.133
Every day, I just go to coffee
shops and think up new magic tricks.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.967
<i>I'm a little bit of a spectacle</i>
<i>because everyone else is out</i>

11:55.033 --> 11:57.300
drinking their coffee and
I'm making flowers disappear.

11:58.233 --> 12:02.267
Eight years ago, I graduated law school,
and then I passed the bar,

12:02.600 --> 12:05.833
<i>and I drove all the way to Las Vegas</i>
<i>to write a book about deception,</i>

12:05.900 --> 12:08.600
<i>and I just lost track of time,</i>
<i>and here I still am.</i>

12:08.933 --> 12:11.300
I came this close to being a lawyer.

12:11.367 --> 12:13.933
<i>I've spent so many years behind</i>
<i>the camera coming up with tricks</i>

12:14.000 --> 12:16.433
for other magicians,
and now it's my chance to go in

12:16.500 --> 12:18.067
front of the camera and see what I can do.

12:18.167 --> 12:21.267
But depending on how I do on Fool Us,
I might go back to law.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.200
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

12:27.967 --> 12:30.533
This next gentleman is a Renaissance man.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.700
I don't know if that means he paints
chapel ceilings like Michelangelo,

12:33.767 --> 12:36.000
or he's a kick-ass
Ninja turtle like Raphael.

12:36.067 --> 12:38.467
Let's find out as we meet Rick Lax.

12:38.633 --> 12:40.433
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

12:43.667 --> 12:45.867
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome to the stage,

12:45.933 --> 12:47.767
Misters Penn and Teller.
Come on up, guys.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.200
Come on up.

12:49.967 --> 12:52.133
Penn right here.
Teller right there.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.000
Sure.

12:56.067 --> 12:59.700
I'm about to make a shuffled
deck of playing cards

12:59.933 --> 13:03.400
magically appear inside
the breast pocket of Mr. Penn Jillette,

13:03.467 --> 13:05.267
and it's gonna happen right now.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.967
Penn, reach in there and pull them out.

13:07.533 --> 13:09.900
-I do have a deck of shuffled cards.
-I'll take them.

13:09.967 --> 13:11.533
So I assume... Thank you.

13:11.633 --> 13:13.033
(APPLAUSE)

13:14.100 --> 13:16.200
I'm gonna give the cards a quick shuffle.

13:16.267 --> 13:17.867
And as I do it, let me ask you,

13:17.933 --> 13:20.367
before you put the cards in your pocket,

13:20.467 --> 13:21.733
did you also shuffle them?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.267
-Yes, I did.
-Okay, great.

13:23.333 --> 13:27.867
Now, Teller, there's 12 cards in the deck
that I'm really good at memorizing.

13:28.167 --> 13:29.600
I'm gonna go through the cards right now.

13:29.667 --> 13:33.600
I'm gonna take out those 12,
and when I do it, oh, boy, is it boring.

13:34.033 --> 13:37.533
Could not be more boring,
so I figured while this is happening,

13:37.600 --> 13:41.867
one of us should entertain the audience
by reciting a nice, long poem.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.300
(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)

13:53.067 --> 13:54.900
We'll have someone else do it.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.267
Penn, is there a poem you like?

13:57.600 --> 13:58.733
Well, there's a few.

13:58.800 --> 14:01.600
I've seen the greatest minds of
my generation destroyed by madness.

14:01.667 --> 14:03.033
Do you want Howl?
Or do you want

14:03.100 --> 14:04.333
The Outlook wasn't brilliant for...

14:04.400 --> 14:05.767
The Outlook...

14:05.833 --> 14:08.000
BOTH: Wasn't brilliant for
the Mudville nine that day.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.467
"The score stood four to two,
with but an inning more to play.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.567
"And when Cooney died at first,
and Barrows did the same,

14:12.633 --> 14:14.733
"a tragic silence fell upon
the patrons of the game.

14:15.233 --> 14:16.700
"A straggling few got up to go
in deep despair.

14:16.767 --> 14:19.133
"The rest clung to hope, which springs
eternal in the human breast.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.333
"They thought, 'if only Casey
could get but a whack at that,'

14:21.433 --> 14:23.333
"we'd put up even money, now,
with Casey at the bat.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.200
"There was an ease in Casey's
manner as he stepped up to...

14:25.267 --> 14:27.300
"There was pride in Casey's
bearing and a smile at Casey's face.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.167
"And when responding to the crowds,
Casey lightly doffed his hat,

14:30.333 --> 14:32.933
"no stranger in the crowd could doubt
'twas Casey at the bat."

14:33.633 --> 14:35.433
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

14:37.967 --> 14:41.767
Teller, you can see I took out
six black cards and six red cards.

14:41.833 --> 14:44.433
I'm gonna ask you to give those
cards a wash,

14:44.500 --> 14:46.367
Vegas style. Just mix them up.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.567
And when he's done, I'm gonna look through
the cards, and I'm gonna try

14:49.633 --> 14:51.667
to memorize the order very quickly.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.800
And then, after I've got the
order memorized,

14:53.867 --> 14:57.467
I'm gonna try to separate them out
into two piles, one with red cards,

14:57.533 --> 14:58.867
one with black cards.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.333
Let's see if I can do it.

15:14.567 --> 15:18.300
So if I did that right, we should have
all the red cards on one side,

15:18.600 --> 15:20.500
and all the black cards on the other side.
Let's see.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.500
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

15:27.000 --> 15:29.067
No, no, wait, wait, no, no.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.833
See, I, no, that's kind.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.333
It's kind, but I cannot accept
that much applause

15:33.400 --> 15:35.267
for a subpar memory demonstration.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.900
It's insulting.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.367
If I'm gonna fool them, I can't just do
something that's hard.

15:41.467 --> 15:43.500
I have got to do something
that is impossible.

15:43.767 --> 15:46.233
So, I'm gonna do the same thing again,

15:46.300 --> 15:48.500
but this time I'm gonna do it
with more cards.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.233
And I'm gonna memorize
the cards as I recite the poem,

15:51.300 --> 15:53.833
and then I'm gonna do
something impossible,

15:54.167 --> 15:55.600
which looks like this.

15:55.933 --> 15:57.700
Where was I?
"Mighty Casey at the bat."

15:57.767 --> 15:59.633
At the bat, that's right.
"10,000 eyes were on him

15:59.700 --> 16:01.767
"as he rubbed his hands with dirt.
5,000 tongues applauded

16:01.833 --> 16:02.967
"as he wiped them on his shirt.

16:03.033 --> 16:04.433
"Then while the writhing pitcher
ground the ball...

16:04.500 --> 16:07.833
"Defiance gleamed in Casey's eye,
a sneer curled Casey's lip.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.800
"And now the leather-covered
sphere comes hurling through the air,

16:12.867 --> 16:15.800
"and Casey stood a-watching
a haughty grandeur there.

16:16.067 --> 16:17.833
"Close by the sturdy batsman
the ball unheeded sped,

16:17.900 --> 16:20.133
"'That ain't my style,' said Casey.
'Strike one,' the umpire said.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.100
"He bade the game go on.
He signaled to the pitcher,

16:22.167 --> 16:23.867
"and again the dun sphere flew.

16:24.167 --> 16:27.400
"And Casey stood a-watching,
and the umpire said...

16:28.333 --> 16:29.867
"'Strike two!'"

16:30.333 --> 16:31.800
That's right.

16:31.933 --> 16:35.033
So, so I got these cards memorized.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.433
You can see there's about 19 of them,
maybe 21.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.933
There's 21.
I'm counting.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.900
And, Teller, with your help
I'm gonna change the order of these cards,

16:44.133 --> 16:48.100
so I can split them up into three piles,
four piles, five piles.

16:48.167 --> 16:50.367
How many piles should I split
the cards up into?

16:50.600 --> 16:51.767
Five piles.

16:51.833 --> 16:54.033
All right, then I'll try to take
out about a fifth of the cards

16:54.100 --> 16:56.400
here, that's pile number one.

16:56.633 --> 16:58.933
Two, three,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.800
four, and I got five, and another,
four and five.

17:03.267 --> 17:05.967
So now I just have to keep track
of which pile is which,

17:06.032 --> 17:08.267
which would have been easier
if you had picked three piles.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.666
Five makes it harder.

17:10.099 --> 17:12.933
Now I'm gonna reassemble them
in whichever order you want.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.099
So if you point to a pile,
we'll put it in my hand.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.400
Okay.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.567
Next.

17:28.733 --> 17:30.067
(LAUGHTER)

17:32.933 --> 17:35.133
And now, Penn, a number.

17:35.867 --> 17:36.933
Ten.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.067
Ten.

17:38.233 --> 17:41.500
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.067
Cut those to the bottom.
Teller, a number.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.433
Ten.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.133
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

17:51.067 --> 17:52.633
So things are pretty simple
from this point on.

17:52.700 --> 17:55.500
All I gotta do is remember
the order the cards were in.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.533
Remember how we changed the
order, track every single one

17:58.600 --> 18:01.200
of the cards, and then split them
up into red and black piles

18:01.267 --> 18:03.067
as we conclude the poem.

18:03.900 --> 18:06.300
-Strike two.
-Strike two.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.300
I'll continue from there.

18:09.000 --> 18:13.700
"'Fraud!' cried the maddened thousands,
and the echo answered fraud.

18:14.033 --> 18:17.467
"But one scornful look from Casey
and the audience was awed.

18:17.767 --> 18:20.033
"They saw his face grow cold and stern,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.767
"they saw his muscles strain,
and they knew that Casey would

18:22.833 --> 18:23.967
"not let the ball go by again.

18:24.033 --> 18:25.067
"The smile has left from Casey's lips,

18:25.133 --> 18:26.200
"his teeth are clenched in hate.

18:26.267 --> 18:28.400
"He pounds with cruel violence
his bat upon the plate.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.333
"And now the pitcher holds the
ball, and now he lets it go,

18:30.400 --> 18:33.200
"and now the air is shattered
by the force of Casey's blow."

18:34.800 --> 18:36.000
(SIGHS)

18:37.567 --> 18:41.000
"Oh, somewhere in this favored
land the stars are shining bright.

18:42.167 --> 18:45.733
"The band is playing somewhere,
and somewhere hearts are light,

18:46.533 --> 18:50.467
"and somewhere men are laughing,
and somewhere children shout,

18:50.833 --> 18:53.233
"but there is no joy in Mudville.

18:53.500 --> 18:54.900
"Mighty Casey has struck out."

18:55.200 --> 18:57.000
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

18:59.400 --> 19:01.200
Rick Lax, ladies and gentlemen.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.333
Wow.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.667
Well, you know how this works.
They're gonna sit down there.

19:05.733 --> 19:07.533
They're gonna deliberate.
Let me ask you about

19:07.600 --> 19:09.233
being here onstage because I think

19:09.300 --> 19:11.367
everyone who comes out here is courageous,

19:11.433 --> 19:13.433
but you've normally been behind
the scenes.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.733
That's right. Usually I create tricks for
other magicians,

19:16.800 --> 19:18.867
so this is a very new experience for me

19:18.933 --> 19:20.233
coming out here and performing
for everybody.

19:20.467 --> 19:22.100
I think it shows an enormous
amount of courage.

19:22.167 --> 19:26.800
Let's hear it for Rick, because to come
out here and do this here in this setting,

19:27.033 --> 19:29.767
wow, that takes a certain bravery.

19:30.067 --> 19:32.167
And maybe a certain foolishness
as well, I don't know.

19:32.233 --> 19:33.700
I don't know. But Teller looks...

19:34.000 --> 19:35.733
It's always hard to tell
what Teller looks like,

19:35.833 --> 19:37.633
but he looks a little surprised.

19:37.700 --> 19:38.867
-He looks a little bit...
RICK: I don't know.

19:38.933 --> 19:41.500
Okay, well, let's go over to him.
Penn, Teller.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.800
Boy, oh, boy.

19:44.367 --> 19:46.700
-That was a good routine.
RICK: Thank you.

19:46.767 --> 19:51.600
And not only that, it was a very, very
flattering routine to, you know,

19:51.667 --> 19:54.533
take <i>Casey at the Bat,</i> which we did
off Broadway and on Broadway.

19:54.700 --> 19:58.700
We're just very flattered by you
using all this Penn and Teller minutiae,

19:58.800 --> 20:00.967
all this trivia to make that so good.

20:01.033 --> 20:05.467
Your performance, I love,
I love the nervous, nutty energy.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.133
You got a little nervous.
Of course, when you sell this,

20:08.767 --> 20:10.867
gives us a lot of information about it,

20:11.467 --> 20:15.100
and we also copped a couple cards
from the table.

20:15.733 --> 20:21.533
We also saw you take the box
and put that box in your pocket.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.533
You put the box away
while you had the cards in your hand,

20:24.833 --> 20:27.000
which means you could have at that moment,

20:27.067 --> 20:31.433
have rung in a cooler,
and the cards could,

20:31.600 --> 20:37.300
in some way, be doctored for you to be
able to figure out which to go which way.

20:38.033 --> 20:41.767
All of that would be true if you
had not fooled us...

20:41.967 --> 20:43.367
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

20:43.433 --> 20:44.700
But you did.

20:44.833 --> 20:45.900
Wow.

20:45.967 --> 20:47.833
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

20:48.667 --> 20:50.367
Really? What a moment!

20:50.433 --> 20:51.600
Congratulations.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.567
The guys want to say,
go around the front there

20:53.633 --> 20:56.167
'cause they want to share with
you there while we bring this down.

20:56.700 --> 20:57.900
Here you go.

20:59.467 --> 21:01.467
We just don't know enough, man. Beautiful.

21:01.533 --> 21:02.767
Thank you.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.833
Rick, this is for you.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.067
-Thank you.
-You fooled them.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.033
You don't just get that delightful trophy,

21:08.733 --> 21:11.433
you'll be coming back here to perform
as part of their act.

21:12.433 --> 21:14.467
Rick Lax, congratulations.

21:15.800 --> 21:18.400
Now one act has already stumped
Penn and Teller and earned

21:18.467 --> 21:21.000
the priceless opportunity
to perform alongside them

21:21.067 --> 21:22.800
in their amazing Vegas show.

21:22.867 --> 21:23.933
Do I hear two?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.533
Let's meet our next potential fooler.

21:28.133 --> 21:31.967
My name is Marcus Eddie,
and I'm a creator.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.333
I think one of the biggest
advantages I have in this show

21:35.400 --> 21:38.300
is that I do create my own magic,
and so what you're going

21:38.367 --> 21:40.100
<i>to see is something original.</i>

21:40.300 --> 21:42.600
<i>My favorite type of magic</i>
<i>is impromptu magic.</i>

21:42.767 --> 21:45.200
<i>I can walk into any place and</i>
<i>pick up something</i>

21:45.300 --> 21:47.033
<i>and immediately do magic with it.</i>

21:50.233 --> 21:53.233
<i>My daughter Alysa helps me out</i>
<i>with some of the magic ideas that I have.</i>

21:53.300 --> 21:54.733
That was great.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.933
Can you do it again?
Do it again.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.933
Of course, children have that
great imagination,

21:58.000 --> 22:01.867
and I just love having a jam session
with her about magical ideas.

22:02.133 --> 22:03.567
<i>That totally gets my mind working.</i>

22:03.700 --> 22:06.333
I truly believe that I can
change my life

22:06.400 --> 22:08.800
and the life of my family,
doing what I do.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.133
(APPLAUSE)

22:11.333 --> 22:13.333
Will you please welcome Marcus Eddie.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.533
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

22:20.400 --> 22:23.633
My name is Marcus Eddie,
and magic has always been...

22:24.133 --> 22:25.467
My escape.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.067
That's why...

22:28.000 --> 22:30.233
I've had this key with me
ever since I was a kid

22:30.533 --> 22:32.333
to remind myself that

22:32.567 --> 22:35.000
I can always unlock my
imagination to get through...

22:36.233 --> 22:37.300
Anything.

22:37.367 --> 22:38.700
(APPLAUSE)

22:43.133 --> 22:46.967
Now I first realized this when studying
one of my favorite magicians,

22:47.167 --> 22:49.967
Harry Houdini, who was also

22:50.567 --> 22:53.433
one of the greatest escape artists
of all time.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.967
Harry Houdini would defy
the laws of physics by passing

22:59.033 --> 23:04.600
his body through solid brick walls,
which to some is the only way

23:04.867 --> 23:07.233
he was able to escape from
handcuffs...

23:09.133 --> 23:10.333
And chains.

23:11.033 --> 23:15.433
Harry Houdini will be a symbol,
a voice for generations to come,

23:15.633 --> 23:18.333
challenging fear every time
he stepped on that stage

23:18.633 --> 23:20.867
saying, "Nothing can hold me."

23:22.967 --> 23:24.300
(APPLAUSE)

23:30.333 --> 23:34.367
Now, the idea of passing through
solid objects is what inspired me

23:34.433 --> 23:37.367
to create something very
special for you, Penn and Teller.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.233
Would you both mind joining me on stage?

23:39.300 --> 23:41.267
Everyone, please help me welcome
Penn and Teller.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.600
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

23:44.433 --> 23:45.933
Hello, Marcus. How you doing?

23:48.800 --> 23:50.733
What I'd like each of you
is to hold right here.

23:50.800 --> 23:52.667
You hold right here,
and you hold right there.

23:52.733 --> 23:54.733
What I'd like you to do is to
pull on the chain,

23:54.800 --> 23:56.233
and as you back away to each end...

23:56.300 --> 23:57.767
(LAUGHTER)

23:57.833 --> 23:59.167
As you back away to each end,

23:59.233 --> 24:02.067
feeling each link to make sure
it's completely solid.

24:04.167 --> 24:07.400
Now you'll also notice that there's
a key tag at each end of the chain.

24:07.467 --> 24:09.033
-Yeah.
-And what I'd like you to do

24:09.533 --> 24:12.133
is to write your initials, draw a picture,

24:12.333 --> 24:16.033
just mark it in a way that you'll be able
to recognize it when you see it again.

24:21.067 --> 24:22.400
(LAUGHTER)

24:28.933 --> 24:30.000
You can keep the markers.

24:30.067 --> 24:31.233
-Wow.
-I'll take the chain,

24:31.533 --> 24:33.233
and you can enjoy
the show from your seats.

24:33.433 --> 24:34.833
Thank you so much for your help.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.833
(APPLAUSE)

24:39.433 --> 24:43.233
Now what you're about to see
may seem unbelievable.

24:43.967 --> 24:48.200
Some of you may look at this as a trick
or a puzzle to be solved,

24:48.867 --> 24:51.700
but I hope more of you look
at this as inspiration

24:51.800 --> 24:54.433
in knowing that nothing is impossible.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.033
I want to give everybody one last look
at the marks from

24:58.500 --> 25:01.967
Penn and Teller.

25:03.400 --> 25:05.567
'Cause in a moment,
I'm gonna pass this chain

25:05.633 --> 25:07.600
right through the middle of my body.

25:08.667 --> 25:10.867
Now there have been times where
I've felt held back

25:10.933 --> 25:12.667
from accomplishing something in my life,

25:13.133 --> 25:18.100
and magic has always been there
to remind me that no matter what,

25:18.967 --> 25:24.000
I can always, if I use my imagination,
get through anything.

25:27.600 --> 25:28.967
(APPLAUSE)

25:35.300 --> 25:38.500
Penn, Teller, I want you to
check the tags to make sure

25:38.567 --> 25:40.167
they are the same tags,

25:40.233 --> 25:43.000
and you can keep that chain
as my gift to you.

25:43.100 --> 25:44.200
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

25:44.267 --> 25:45.633
My name is Marcus Eddie.

25:47.100 --> 25:48.833
Marcus Eddie, ladies and gentlemen.

25:49.500 --> 25:51.033
Fantastic. Wow.

25:51.167 --> 25:53.300
That was very, very impressive.

25:53.967 --> 25:55.133
You know, I noticed there seemed
to be a theme

25:55.200 --> 25:56.433
in what you were talking about.

25:56.500 --> 25:57.633
Talking about
getting through things

25:57.700 --> 25:58.733
and nothing being impossible.

25:58.833 --> 26:00.300
Is that something you hope
to spread with your magic?

26:00.367 --> 26:02.133
Is that a message you believe
in getting out there?

26:02.200 --> 26:03.500
Yes, definitely. With magic

26:03.567 --> 26:05.167
I want to inspire
everybody to let them know

26:05.233 --> 26:07.533
that you can accomplish anything
that you want to.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.800
You just gotta have the guts
to go for your dreams,

26:09.867 --> 26:10.900
so there you go.

26:10.967 --> 26:12.600
Now you weren't always doing this,
were you?

26:12.667 --> 26:13.800
-No, I wasn't.
-What were you doing?

26:13.867 --> 26:14.900
What was your job before this?

26:14.967 --> 26:16.900
Most of my jobs were, like,
customer service,

26:16.967 --> 26:19.633
cubicle jobs,
and I was just,

26:19.900 --> 26:22.300
I felt like my potential wasn't being met,

26:22.367 --> 26:24.600
so I just, I decided to take
a leap of faith,

26:24.900 --> 26:27.967
and I really wanted to show my daughter
that she can also follow her dreams,

26:28.033 --> 26:31.600
and she doesn't have to go the same path
that everybody goes through, so yeah.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.400
Wow, that's a lovely thing.
That really is.

26:33.700 --> 26:35.567
-So leading by example.
-Yes.

26:35.633 --> 26:38.733
Okay, I think they're ready
to tell you what their verdict is.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.133
Let's go to Penn. Penn,

26:40.200 --> 26:42.467
what do you think of Marcus
and do you know how it was done?

26:42.967 --> 26:45.400
Well, I gotta tell you, you know,
a lot of people come

26:45.467 --> 26:48.367
up here with stuff that they've
gotten somewhere else.

26:48.433 --> 26:53.467
Now this has a little bit of
a lineage with Harbin and with Bob Sheets,

26:53.667 --> 26:56.700
but we really do believe you invented it.

26:57.033 --> 27:00.400
This variation seems
to be very much yours.

27:00.700 --> 27:04.600
We also love the fact, you know,
Teller and I are cheap carny trash,

27:04.667 --> 27:06.233
so when you bribe us...

27:06.767 --> 27:09.467
When you bribe us with
brand-new shiny chain,

27:09.867 --> 27:14.700
and brand-new pens, we're very,
very eager to have you fool us,

27:15.100 --> 27:18.467
but I think the fact is that if
you fooled us right now,

27:18.733 --> 27:20.967
we'd want to go up there
and pat you on the back.

27:21.167 --> 27:24.100
And I don't think you really did
completely fool us,

27:24.300 --> 27:26.367
and I think you know what
I'm talking about. Is that right?

27:26.433 --> 27:27.667
That's it.
You did a great job.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.200
-Great job.
-What a great trick.

27:30.133 --> 27:32.533
It is my honor to actually
perform for you.

27:32.600 --> 27:35.033
Both of you have definitely been
an inspiration to me, so thank you.

27:35.100 --> 27:36.567
It's a wonderful trick, man.
Wonderful trick.

27:36.633 --> 27:37.933
Thank you so much.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.400
So you're...

27:39.967 --> 27:41.167
You're comfortable?

27:41.833 --> 27:43.600
-And thanks!
-Yes, yes.

27:43.667 --> 27:45.800
So, Marcus, you're comfortable
they busted you.

27:45.867 --> 27:47.067
You didn't fool them this time.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.600
-They are the masters.
-I gonna give you the chance.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.133
Do you want to get that chain and
those pens back before you go?

27:51.233 --> 27:52.633
-No, no, they're good.
-They're good?

27:52.800 --> 27:54.900
Marcus, it was great to meet you.
What a nice, young man.

27:54.967 --> 27:56.767
-Marcus Eddie, ladies and gentlemen.
-Thank you so much.

27:56.900 --> 27:58.167
Congratulations.

27:58.233 --> 27:59.600
Great job.

28:00.933 --> 28:03.133
Let's meet our next heartwarming act.

28:05.767 --> 28:08.367
I'm Bruce Gold, and I am
a comedy magician.

28:08.433 --> 28:10.167
<i>Though not always in that order.</i>

28:11.300 --> 28:13.533
What is it with kids and their
fascination with magic?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.133
When I was 14 years old,

28:15.200 --> 28:19.000
<i>the first trick I bought was called</i>
<i>"The Appearing Cane."</i>

28:19.333 --> 28:22.167
<i>When I was 15, I did a birthday</i>
<i>party for a neighbor.</i>

28:22.233 --> 28:23.233
<i>It was a 30 minute show.</i>

28:23.300 --> 28:26.633
I was paid $30,
and I did the math, $1 a minute.

28:26.700 --> 28:28.167
This is a genius profession.

28:28.433 --> 28:29.633
I'm gonna be a magician.

28:29.767 --> 28:32.067
I've always wondered about
the difference between a comedian

28:32.200 --> 28:34.700
<i>who does magic and a magician</i>
<i>who does comedy.</i>

28:35.100 --> 28:36.400
<i>And I'm not really sure which one I am,</i>

28:36.467 --> 28:38.767
<i>but I know if you're doing comedy first,</i>

28:38.833 --> 28:40.900
you better have a lot of laughs
in your show.

28:40.967 --> 28:42.667
You know what's crazy?
I'll tell you crazy.

28:42.733 --> 28:45.667
Crazy would be a network
television show where magicians

28:45.733 --> 28:46.933
tried to fool Penn and Teller.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.333
(DRUM ROLL)

28:48.833 --> 28:50.633
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

28:52.000 --> 28:55.867
This next performer is a combination
of a stand-up comic and a magician,

28:55.933 --> 28:58.100
which means his therapy bill
is twice as high.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.533
Will you please welcome Bruce Gold.

29:00.667 --> 29:01.967
Thank you.

29:02.033 --> 29:03.367
Thank you.

29:03.567 --> 29:05.200
-(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
-Thank you very much.

29:05.267 --> 29:06.567
Thank you, wow.

29:06.633 --> 29:10.167
For this trick, I'm gonna need the help
of a lady from the audience,

29:10.233 --> 29:11.800
so I'll just look for a friendly face.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.433
Let's see, hi, you have
a very pretty smile. You help?

29:14.967 --> 29:16.400
Give her some encouragement, right?

29:18.333 --> 29:19.567
Take my hand.

29:20.033 --> 29:22.133
Follow me. I've been here before.
I know the way.

29:23.167 --> 29:25.300
Right over here to my right,
turn around, face the lovely people.

29:25.433 --> 29:26.933
-Tell me your name.
-May.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.600
Hi, May, nice to meet you.

29:28.667 --> 29:29.700
Come with me right over here.

29:29.767 --> 29:32.900
Um, are you afraid of snakes?

29:33.333 --> 29:35.200
-No.
-Good. Ooh, ah, well.

29:35.267 --> 29:36.567
(IMITATES BOW AND ARROW FIRING)
Hunger Games, ah!

29:36.633 --> 29:38.667
Snakes, bring it on.
I like your style.

29:38.733 --> 29:39.967
All right, guess what I have?

29:40.733 --> 29:42.433
-Snake.
-Snakes, plural.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.667
Live one and a dead one.
Reach in, let's see which one you get.

29:44.733 --> 29:45.967
Go ahead.

29:46.700 --> 29:48.600
Oh, suddenly we're a little less
than cooperative.

29:48.667 --> 29:50.667
All right, stay right there.
I'll protect you.

29:50.733 --> 29:53.100
Underneath this box, something
far more dangerous than a serpent.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.200
It's a toaster.

29:55.267 --> 29:57.733
-(CANNED SCREAMING)
-Wait, I can control it.

29:58.933 --> 30:00.433
Brought my own frightened crowd
with me, May.

30:00.500 --> 30:03.367
It's a toaster, or if you're a
thrill-seeker, a bath toy.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.233
-(LAUGHTER)
-Now, um...

30:05.800 --> 30:07.700
Did I not just say it was
dangerous, right? Okay.

30:08.067 --> 30:10.933
May, have you seen the game
shows on TV with the prize girls?

30:11.033 --> 30:13.033
-Yeah.
-Awesome. Okay, assume the position.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.667
Let me help, let me help.
Stand right here.

30:15.967 --> 30:17.100
Right here, right here.
Perfect.

30:17.167 --> 30:19.067
A little more forward,
left hand out like so.

30:19.267 --> 30:21.133
Good. Right hand out, palm up.
Perfect.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.067
I'm gonna have the announcer
describe the toaster

30:23.133 --> 30:25.100
and then you model it like the
prize girls on TV. Perfect.

30:25.667 --> 30:27.000
Then I'll say, "Show them the card,"

30:27.067 --> 30:28.533
and when I say that,
you'll lift this card up.

30:28.600 --> 30:31.133
It has the price on the front,
and don't forget to smile.

30:31.233 --> 30:33.533
Perfect, okay. All right.

30:33.600 --> 30:37.767
Mr. Announcer, tell the lovely
May and all of us all about it.

30:38.633 --> 30:41.900
ANNOUNCER: <i>Sure thing, Bruce.</i>
<i>Yes, it's no ordinary toaster.</i>

30:42.000 --> 30:46.433
<i>It's a Toastmaster</i>
<i>for masterful toasting slice after slice.</i>

30:47.067 --> 30:49.967
-Show the card.
<i>-Retail value, $19.95.</i>

30:50.133 --> 30:51.467
Big smile.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.000
(APPLAUSE)

30:54.800 --> 30:58.000
Wow, way to own it, May.

30:58.067 --> 30:59.600
Well done.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.267
And I have captured your moment
in this wallet-size photo.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.300
This will be yours after
the show for...

31:04.633 --> 31:06.267
(LAUGHTER)

31:06.333 --> 31:08.433
May, I don't know if you noticed
as you modeled the toaster,

31:08.500 --> 31:11.333
which you did superbly incidentally,
it's a one-slicer.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.433
Real toaster made by Toastmaster
back in the forties.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.033
But I wouldn't waste your time
with some wacky antique, May.

31:17.100 --> 31:22.067
This is not just a one-slice toaster,
it's the world's only psychic toaster.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.933
(LAUGHTER)

31:24.133 --> 31:28.067
It's an adventure into the world
of wonder and ESP.

31:28.133 --> 31:30.033
May, pick a slice, any slice.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.567
I'll choose this one.

31:31.633 --> 31:33.000
Now you may change your mind if you wish.

31:33.567 --> 31:34.667
Okay.

31:34.967 --> 31:36.300
(LAUGHTER)

31:36.967 --> 31:38.667
Oh, good choice.
That's my favorite. Okay.

31:39.300 --> 31:43.233
By the way, this trick is not
gluten-free. I apologize. Okay.

31:44.167 --> 31:45.867
May, go ahead and memorize your slice.

31:46.467 --> 31:48.367
It's white bread, just like me.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.800
All right, go ahead.
Put it in the toaster for me.

31:51.167 --> 31:52.667
Get that baby fired up.

31:52.733 --> 31:54.600
Okay... (GASPS) and she cooks, too.

31:54.667 --> 31:56.333
Awesome. Okay.

31:56.933 --> 31:58.267
Ziploc bag right there.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.667
Inside of it, a deck of cards.

31:59.733 --> 32:01.933
People in the front, you might
see a familiar card here

32:02.000 --> 32:03.533
in the plastic of the bag.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.767
People in the back...

32:04.833 --> 32:06.700
Come early next time.

32:06.767 --> 32:07.833
Good, okay, great.

32:07.900 --> 32:10.233
I'm gonna shuffle.
We'll let the lovely May select a card.

32:10.300 --> 32:12.600
May, reach in there with your left hand,
just take out one card.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.400
Just take one, don't be greedy.
Don't show me.

32:14.467 --> 32:16.667
Don't show the audience.
Whatever you do, do not show

32:16.733 --> 32:18.467
the psychic toaster.
Good.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.267
Have you memorized your card, May?

32:20.333 --> 32:21.500
-Yes.
-Good.

32:21.567 --> 32:25.400
I will now pass the thought
of the card through May's body.

32:27.067 --> 32:29.167
I know, you're thinking,
over my dead body.

32:30.433 --> 32:33.067
Actually, May, the thoughts will
travel using a kitchen fork

32:33.300 --> 32:36.633
because thoughts are electric,
so the fork is the conduit... (SIZZLES)

32:36.800 --> 32:37.967
Ho!

32:38.033 --> 32:39.367
(CHUCKLES)

32:40.533 --> 32:41.833
(BLOWS AIR) Yow.

32:42.333 --> 32:43.667
Your turn.

32:45.233 --> 32:47.633
All right, don't electrocute
yourself, just hold that.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.733
-Buzz!
-(CHUCKLES)

32:49.800 --> 32:52.033
Okay, I have some safety
equipment. One second.

32:53.633 --> 32:55.567
Watching you.
Easy with that fork.

32:55.633 --> 32:58.233
Okay, no need to tenderize
Mr. Magic, okay.

32:59.633 --> 33:00.867
I'll take the fork.

33:01.533 --> 33:04.600
Even as I speak, the toaster has begun
to singe an image into the bread.

33:04.667 --> 33:05.867
I'll need your hand.

33:05.933 --> 33:08.567
Perfect. Now, think of your card.
Stay in the show.

33:08.633 --> 33:10.700
Think of your card flowing
through your body.

33:10.900 --> 33:12.167
Here we go.

33:14.067 --> 33:17.700
Ah! Did you feel our thoughts
race into the toaster, May?

33:18.800 --> 33:20.000
-Yes.
-Remember who has the pointy fork.

33:20.067 --> 33:21.433
Yes, she said.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.767
Even as I speak, the toaster is
singing an image into the bread,

33:24.833 --> 33:26.967
and if there is an image
on this slice of bread

33:27.033 --> 33:30.700
that looks like the card that May
selected, will this be a good trick?

33:31.167 --> 33:32.333
ALL: Yes.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.367
It'd be a miracle.
Come on, people.

33:34.433 --> 33:37.567
Mind reading toaster not a tad
unusual to some of you.

33:37.733 --> 33:38.833
Okay.

33:38.900 --> 33:40.967
May, tell me,
take a little step forward, if you would.

33:41.033 --> 33:43.367
Tell me, what is the card
that you picked?

33:43.533 --> 33:45.933
-Tell me.
-Uh, two.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.667
Two, yes, two of diamonds, yes.

33:47.733 --> 33:51.233
Show them, show them right out
in front like, two of diamonds.

33:51.300 --> 33:54.100
Popping the bread out of the toaster.
Can you hold it up just like that?

33:54.467 --> 33:55.533
Yep, take a look.

33:56.733 --> 33:58.133
Can't buy a reaction like that.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.933
It's really a two and a diamond.
It is a psychic toaster.

34:02.300 --> 34:03.500
Wow.

34:03.767 --> 34:05.633
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

34:07.433 --> 34:08.933
Let's hear it for May.

34:09.933 --> 34:12.233
Bruce Gold, ladies and gentlemen,
Bruce Gold.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.933
-Bruce, that was great.
-Thank you, Jonathan.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.100
Very funny, and also a great trick.

34:16.167 --> 34:18.833
I have no idea how you did that,
of course.

34:19.067 --> 34:21.199
But what is that, you said this
was a genuine toaster.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.300
I've never seen a one-slice toaster.

34:23.367 --> 34:24.766
Was this really something
that was for sale?

34:24.833 --> 34:26.266
It's a real toaster

34:26.333 --> 34:28.467
made back in the forties.
Apartments were very tiny then.

34:28.533 --> 34:29.699
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHTER)

34:29.766 --> 34:32.867
It struck me though, it was
a great mix of the comedy and the magic,

34:32.933 --> 34:34.467
and that's very hard to bring together.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.933
So congratulations to Bruce
once again for pulling that off

34:37.067 --> 34:39.333
'cause it was so entertaining,

34:40.100 --> 34:41.833
but I think the fellows may have

34:41.900 --> 34:45.600
come to an agreement whether or
not they're right, you can say.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.167
Gentlemen?

34:47.233 --> 34:51.533
Well, you know, we're having
a great example here of comedy magic.

34:52.033 --> 34:56.000
And in comedy magic,
many times people forget to do

34:56.067 --> 34:58.067
the comedy and the magic.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.733
And it's wonderful to see
somebody do both.

35:01.067 --> 35:04.400
We're thrilled to pieces
to see a toaster on stage.

35:06.067 --> 35:08.733
There's a great deal of
confidence with that.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.433
The trick is a really, really good trick.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.033
-Thank you.
-There's two pieces of information,

35:12.100 --> 35:15.033
which is getting the image
onto the toaster,

35:15.533 --> 35:19.500
and then there is you could
either worry about that as

35:19.700 --> 35:23.067
how do you have 52 possible images
that could be burned onto a toaster.

35:23.267 --> 35:25.200
Or there's another way to do that,
of course.

35:25.667 --> 35:30.867
And it turns out that my daughter,
when she was maybe three years old,

35:31.067 --> 35:35.200
she used a little plastic bag so
that there could be a random card

35:35.267 --> 35:37.800
picked out of that, and did a wonderful,

35:37.867 --> 35:42.233
wonderful job with that,
and as much as I love my daughter,

35:42.400 --> 35:44.500
and as cute as she was
on The View,

35:44.700 --> 35:46.700
you did a much
better job with that trick.

35:46.900 --> 35:48.667
You didn't fool us, but you killed us.

35:48.733 --> 35:50.033
Thank you so much.

35:50.100 --> 35:51.600
Wow.
Thank you.

35:51.667 --> 35:53.467
So, Bruce, just to confirm...

35:53.533 --> 35:54.667
Yes.

35:55.533 --> 35:57.500
They nailed you.
They know how you did it.

35:57.567 --> 35:59.267
You think they're in the right area there?

35:59.333 --> 36:01.533
They are in the right neighborhood.

36:01.600 --> 36:02.833
I would say yes.

36:02.900 --> 36:04.800
Bruce, well, you didn't fool
them, but you gave us all

36:04.867 --> 36:06.300
a great show, didn't he,
ladies and gentlemen?

36:06.933 --> 36:08.867
Bruce Gold, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you so much.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.600
That was fabulous.

36:10.833 --> 36:12.367
Mr. Bruce Gold.

36:15.533 --> 36:17.533
Now these guys have been
performing magic together

36:17.633 --> 36:19.267
for over four decades,

36:19.333 --> 36:22.033
which makes this next trick the second
oldest one in the books.

36:22.200 --> 36:24.933
The first oldest is pretending
to yawn so you can put your arm

36:25.000 --> 36:26.067
around a lady's shoulders.

36:26.133 --> 36:27.467
That's an oldie, but a goodie,
but here they are,

36:27.533 --> 36:30.367
ladies and gentlemen,
the phenomenal Penn and Teller.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.600
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

36:32.833 --> 36:34.233
(JAZZ MUSIC)

36:48.333 --> 36:50.300
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

36:55.367 --> 36:58.100
This is not intended to
glorify smoking.

36:58.167 --> 37:01.167
That said... Looks simple, doesn't it?

37:02.400 --> 37:05.133
But when you're dealing with
a master of sleight of hand

37:05.200 --> 37:06.867
like my partner, Teller,

37:06.933 --> 37:11.500
even the simplest activity
may be a complex deception.

37:13.033 --> 37:16.100
Let's watch that routine again.

37:16.800 --> 37:19.467
Is he really crushing out his cigarette?

37:19.867 --> 37:22.033
Is he really adjusting his hat?

37:22.567 --> 37:24.800
Is he really pulling out
a fresh cigarette?

37:25.067 --> 37:28.033
Is he really bothered by that
itch in his left eye?

37:28.300 --> 37:32.600
Is he really just lighting a cigarette?

37:37.767 --> 37:40.967
To understand the complexity
of Teller's life,

37:41.833 --> 37:46.633
you need to know the seven
basic principles of magic.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.500
(APPLAUSE)

37:49.667 --> 37:51.667
One, palm.

37:52.233 --> 37:56.333
To hold an object in an apparently
empty hand.

37:57.167 --> 37:58.633
Two, ditch.

37:58.767 --> 38:01.667
To secretly dispose of an unneeded object.

38:02.733 --> 38:04.267
Three, steal.

38:04.333 --> 38:05.900
The opposite of ditch.

38:05.967 --> 38:08.467
To secretly obtain a needed object.

38:09.233 --> 38:10.900
Four, load.

38:11.167 --> 38:14.000
To secretly move the needed object to...

38:14.767 --> 38:16.067
Where it's needed.

38:16.833 --> 38:19.033
Five, simulation.

38:19.333 --> 38:23.067
To give the impression
that something that hasn't happened has.

38:24.100 --> 38:25.767
Six, misdirection.

38:25.933 --> 38:28.067
To lead attention away
from the secret move.

38:28.533 --> 38:30.200
And seven, switch.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.967
To secretly exchange
one object for another.

38:34.100 --> 38:36.200
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

38:39.767 --> 38:42.433
Teller needs nothing but a pencil,

38:43.300 --> 38:47.167
one lit cigarette,
and a flashlight.

38:48.067 --> 38:50.900
Let's watch that original
routine again.

38:51.500 --> 38:54.733
But this time,
from the other side.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.333
(LAUGHTER)

38:57.967 --> 39:01.600
He palms the cigarette.

39:02.233 --> 39:04.933
He simulates crushing it out.

39:05.433 --> 39:08.433
He steals the palmed lit
cigarette and ditches

39:08.500 --> 39:10.867
the lit cigarette in his ear.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.733
(LAUGHTER)

39:13.400 --> 39:18.333
He exhales smoke to misdirect
the smoke coming out from around his hat.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.700
He steals the pencil.

39:21.633 --> 39:24.933
He simulates taking the pencil,
which is simulating a cigarette,

39:25.033 --> 39:27.000
from the nonexistent cigarette pack

39:27.067 --> 39:29.533
and puts a simulated cigarette
in his mouth.

39:30.233 --> 39:34.067
He rubs his eye to misdirect
as he loads the burning

39:34.133 --> 39:35.433
cigarette from his ear.

39:36.333 --> 39:39.033
He simulates a lighter
with a flashlight

39:39.167 --> 39:42.067
and switches the lit cigarette
for the unlit pencil

39:42.233 --> 39:46.667
under cover of misdirection
from the flashlight.

39:50.267 --> 39:54.967
Palm, simulation, steal, ditch,
misdirection,

39:55.067 --> 39:57.933
steal, simulation, misdirection,

39:58.067 --> 40:02.367
load, simulation, switch, misdirection.

40:10.300 --> 40:11.667
Looks simple, doesn't it?

40:11.733 --> 40:13.567
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

40:15.467 --> 40:17.467
Isn't that just beautiful,
ladies and gentlemen?

40:17.533 --> 40:19.567
The exquisite talent of Penn and Teller.

40:19.800 --> 40:22.800
A spectacular example of pure magic.

40:23.067 --> 40:25.467
No smoke, no mirrors,
well, a little smoke.

40:25.667 --> 40:26.733
That's our show for tonight.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.767
There'll be more from
<i>Penn and Teller Fool Us</i> next time.

40:28.933 --> 40:30.433
Thanks for watching.
Good night, everybody.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.400
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

40:32.533 --> 40:33.933
