00:02.077 --> 00:04.830
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...
- Conrad, this is Celia.

00:04.914 --> 00:07.333
I fucked a black man. Conrad.

00:07.416 --> 00:08.751
Just a little something

00:08.834 --> 00:11.337
to say thank you for all your help.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.839
Welcome to your new home, Ms Hodes.

00:13.923 --> 00:16.759
We'll have to keep it
in the corporation's name for six months.

00:16.842 --> 00:19.094
- I thought Dean was out of your life.
- He was...

00:19.178 --> 00:22.640
till the handitard went
and drove off of a cliff.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.309
The surgery was successful,
but he'll need several more.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.102
There's no one else but you.

00:27.144 --> 00:28.562
Oh, God.

00:28.646 --> 00:33.192
- I have to sell the Majestic house.
- You can't sell the Majestic house.

00:33.275 --> 00:37.112
If you try to sell it, the jig's up.
You'll go to jail for accepting a bribe.

00:37.196 --> 00:39.740
- How you doing, baby?
- I'm fuckin' pregnant again.

00:39.823 --> 00:42.117
Some Indian kid I mercy-fucked for U-Turn.

00:43.285 --> 00:45.829
- God bless the new Majestic!
- I quit.

00:45.913 --> 00:49.375
You make this easy for me,
we can do it on the table.

00:50.417 --> 00:53.128
- We need these votes.
- I'm thinking a golf membership.

00:53.212 --> 00:54.421
Your membership's been revoked.

00:54.505 --> 00:57.841
Sullivan Groff and this whole fucking place
can kiss my black ass.

00:57.925 --> 00:59.218
I'm an elected official!

00:59.301 --> 01:01.804
You were elected by a city that no longer exists.

01:01.887 --> 01:05.558
This council is not finished looking into
your questionable investment in Aguatecture.

01:05.683 --> 01:07.726
Aguatecture. You're soaking in it.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.645
- What goes on here?
- Fountains.

01:09.728 --> 01:12.064
- Celia came to Aguatecture.
- What does she know?

01:12.147 --> 01:13.732
She knows you fucked her boyfriend

01:13.816 --> 01:17.111
and she knows you're dealing again
and she'll be in touch.

01:31.375 --> 01:34.545
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:43.387 --> 01:46.181
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:57.818 --> 01:59.904
<i># All the same</i>

02:07.953 --> 02:11.665
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:14.293 --> 02:16.462
You should be very afraid of me...

02:17.296 --> 02:18.339
slut.

02:23.260 --> 02:27.514
I watched you have sex
with the best man I've ever known.

02:29.266 --> 02:30.684
- You watched?
- Yeah.

02:30.768 --> 02:34.355
I've never been able to come vaginally.

02:36.815 --> 02:38.442
How long did you watch?

02:38.525 --> 02:40.653
I want in.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.156
I want in on your action...

02:44.615 --> 02:46.325
you mean slut.

02:46.408 --> 02:48.077
Cunt, whore... bitch.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.246
Coming down with Tourette's, Celia?

02:50.329 --> 02:54.458
I know everything you're doing
and I will tell the police.

02:55.834 --> 02:57.211
Wow!

02:58.754 --> 03:00.214
That would not be advisable.

03:00.297 --> 03:02.716
Not taking my threat seriously

03:02.800 --> 03:04.635
would not be advisable.

03:04.718 --> 03:07.638
Playing by the rules has gotten me nowhere
but fucked.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.473
So I am done.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.517
And you will start paying

03:11.600 --> 03:14.603
for the many, many sins against me,

03:14.687 --> 03:16.313
in cash, right now.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.988
OK.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.157
In my line of work

03:27.241 --> 03:30.244
I realise that I'm susceptible

03:30.327 --> 03:32.997
to blackmail, shakedowns,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.665
whatever you wanna call it.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.959
Up to now, I've been accommodating

03:37.042 --> 03:40.045
the extortionists in my life, but today -

03:41.338 --> 03:44.216
call it bad timing, call it karma -

03:44.300 --> 03:46.760
I've reached a tipping point,

03:47.761 --> 03:49.847
a critical mass, if you will,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.349
and I'm done.

03:52.433 --> 03:53.642
No more.

03:55.311 --> 03:56.812
So, Celia...

03:58.063 --> 04:00.608
if you go to the police...

04:02.484 --> 04:07.531
if you continue to threaten me
or my family in any way,

04:07.615 --> 04:09.992
I... will kill you.

04:10.743 --> 04:12.369
I will kill you.

04:13.245 --> 04:15.789
I will end your life.

04:15.873 --> 04:17.958
Mom!

04:18.041 --> 04:19.584
Shane!

04:19.668 --> 04:20.920
Say hello to Mrs Hodes.

04:22.880 --> 04:27.009
You are a fucking sociopath.

04:27.593 --> 04:29.553
Thanks for stopping by.

04:32.223 --> 04:34.475
Were you really going to kill her?

04:34.558 --> 04:39.021
She threatened Mommy,
and we can't have that,

04:39.104 --> 04:40.481
so I had to scare her.

04:41.941 --> 04:45.527
This is kind of how it's gonna be
from now on, huh?

04:46.570 --> 04:50.115
Yeah... I think it is.

04:50.199 --> 04:51.450
What are we doing here?

04:51.534 --> 04:55.120
He promised me golf,
promised me power...

04:55.204 --> 04:57.915
then he bent me over
and he fucked me up the ass,

04:57.998 --> 05:01.210
like an innocent altar boy
alone in the vestry after services,

05:01.335 --> 05:04.255
lured by promises of juice and cookies.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.090
Some vivid imagery there, Doug.

05:06.173 --> 05:09.301
With his stupid hair.
What grown man has blond hair?

05:09.385 --> 05:13.430
All right, time to go. Come with me.
We'll get Dean, sell some wacky.

05:13.514 --> 05:17.309
No. It's time for Doug
to rise from the ashes.

05:17.393 --> 05:22.022
I must reclaim what's rightfully mine, Andy,
and I must fuck his shit up.

05:22.106 --> 05:24.858
As God is my witness, I will get him.

05:24.942 --> 05:28.904
Well, I see you're in the disturbing throes
of revenge-scheming

05:28.988 --> 05:32.116
and you're not letting go,
so I'm going to leave you to it.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.118
Catch you later, man.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.580
Victory will be mine, Andy.

05:37.663 --> 05:39.707
Dumb-name will know my wrath.

05:39.790 --> 05:41.709
The wrath of Doug.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.294
It's comin'.

05:43.377 --> 05:47.214
So now I come back once, twice a year,
get a pastrami on rye down at Langer's,

05:47.298 --> 05:49.091
see the kids, see the grandkids.

05:49.967 --> 05:52.511
Then I can't wait to get back
to my place in Maui.

05:52.595 --> 05:57.474
I got a girlfriend, name is Hepualaha'ole.

05:57.558 --> 06:00.769
Roasts whole pigs in her backyard.
She's crazy.

06:01.812 --> 06:04.899
Anyway, so, I get a call
from the fire department,

06:04.982 --> 06:07.026
said they gotta do an inspection.

06:07.109 --> 06:09.695
Said they left a bunch of cards,

06:09.778 --> 06:13.157
I said, "Come by tomorrow morning. "

06:13.282 --> 06:15.075
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, gotta be tomorrow.

06:15.159 --> 06:17.161
I'm going back to Hawaii tomorrow night

06:17.244 --> 06:19.788
and I promised them
I would personally let them in.

06:19.872 --> 06:22.166
I got a lotta buildings down here, Ms James.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.335
I got to stay in good with the LAFD, huh?

06:24.418 --> 06:26.837
Mm. Tomorrow?

06:26.921 --> 06:29.215
You got some illegals back there?

06:29.298 --> 06:31.091
Hey, everybody does,

06:31.175 --> 06:33.385
- it's the way business is done.
- Yeah.

06:33.469 --> 06:36.347
Don't worry. We'll come by in the morning,

06:36.430 --> 06:38.307
we'll be out of your hair by first bell.

06:38.390 --> 06:42.019
No, it's not that. It's just, er,
we, erm...

06:42.102 --> 06:45.439
You know,
we work with polymers and resins...

06:45.522 --> 06:47.650
You box 'em, you get 'em outta here,

06:47.691 --> 06:50.361
you pull 'em back in
as soon as they're gone.

06:50.444 --> 06:54.782
It's the cost of doing business, darling.
And what is this, huh, once a year?

06:54.865 --> 06:56.408
- It's not so bad.
- Mm.

06:56.492 --> 07:00.079
Anyway, thank you for the coffee,
it was absolutely delicious,

07:00.204 --> 07:02.623
- but I'm gonna send you some Kona.
- Ahh.

07:02.706 --> 07:06.418
And I'm gonna see you in the morning,
bright and early, huh?

07:06.502 --> 07:08.337
I love the, er...

07:08.379 --> 07:10.172
- er...
- Yeah!

07:10.256 --> 07:13.300
Ahh.

07:18.681 --> 07:22.518
Well, that didn't take too long.
You charm the slacks off the landlord, Heylia?

07:22.601 --> 07:26.063
He bringing the fire marshal up in here
first thing tomorrow.

07:26.605 --> 07:28.899
- We all goin' to jail.
- Holy shit.

07:28.983 --> 07:31.527
Says it's every building, every year.

07:31.610 --> 07:33.195
How the fuck you didn't know?

07:33.279 --> 07:34.947
How am I supposed to know
about the fire marshal?

07:35.030 --> 07:38.158
You in charge, big man.
You supposed to find this shit out.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.703
What do we do?

07:40.786 --> 07:43.789
Don't look at me.
I just work here.

07:44.915 --> 07:47.710
Silas? All right, I'm coming right now.

07:48.627 --> 07:50.880
Mommy's gotta go somewhere.

07:50.963 --> 07:53.757
- Of course you do.
- There's an emergency.

07:54.884 --> 07:56.802
- Can I come?
- No.

07:58.012 --> 07:59.388
You suck.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.808
I know, but...

08:02.892 --> 08:05.686
one day, I'm gonna make it all up to you.

08:05.769 --> 08:07.021
I swear.

08:07.104 --> 08:09.690
I'm gonna baby-sit your kids,

08:09.773 --> 08:13.319
give you the down payment
for your first house,

08:13.402 --> 08:16.947
I'm going to send you to Europe...
after college.

08:17.031 --> 08:18.365
Hey!

08:18.407 --> 08:22.536
We'll rent a house at the beach
one summer, take walks.

08:23.704 --> 08:27.833
We'll look back on this as the dark time.

08:29.418 --> 08:31.378
- Where are you taking me?
- Therapy.

08:31.462 --> 08:33.839
- What kind of therapy?
- Special therapy.

08:33.923 --> 08:36.926
The doctor has you on a programme,
I have your exercises charted...

08:37.009 --> 08:38.260
- Damn.
- What?

08:38.344 --> 08:39.845
- Beer!
... if you jump ahead...

08:39.929 --> 08:42.222
What kind of therapy requires beer?

08:42.306 --> 08:46.060
Regression therapy.
Takes you all the way back to high school.

08:46.143 --> 08:49.688
- Ah! Cold!
- Oh! You can feel that! Sorry.

08:49.772 --> 08:53.651
And that's excellent.
Happy for you, man.

08:53.734 --> 08:57.488
Take this and give it to the therapist
so she knows what plan you've been on.

08:59.448 --> 09:02.159
Parking close and partying hard.

09:02.243 --> 09:04.703
- Bye, honey.
- Bye... Dad.

09:14.129 --> 09:15.506
- Mom's here.
- Yeah...

09:15.589 --> 09:18.384
like I can wave my magic wand,
make it all better.

09:18.467 --> 09:20.678
We got eight hours till these plants
need to be back under light.

09:20.761 --> 09:23.764
To break it all down,
find a new grow house and set it up again.

09:23.847 --> 09:26.976
- So, where we taking it?
- Where are we taking it?

09:27.059 --> 09:29.645
Uh-uh. I'm just the buyer.

09:29.728 --> 09:31.188
It's your crop. You pay for it.

09:31.272 --> 09:33.732
- Dying plant, coming through.
- That's bullshit.

09:33.816 --> 09:37.361
You gave us money, we planted a crop with it.
The crop is yours. Can't smoke it yet.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.280
I suggest you find us some place to move it.

09:39.363 --> 09:42.157
- Oh, so, you jump, and I'm the net.
- Pretty much.

09:42.241 --> 09:44.660
Kinda strange little role reversal going on, huh?

09:44.743 --> 09:46.579
- Fuck you.
- Fine, fuck me.

09:46.662 --> 09:49.415
But you got to find us someplace tonight,
or we out of business.

09:49.498 --> 09:52.209
Actually, you out of business.

09:52.293 --> 09:54.003
I also need some people who can help,

09:54.086 --> 09:57.631
not stand there slack-jawed,
arguing about who fucked up.

10:00.593 --> 10:01.594
Shit.

10:15.733 --> 10:19.653
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.

10:19.737 --> 10:21.488
See that biker chick over there?

10:22.281 --> 10:24.700
She's been eyeing me for weeks.

10:26.243 --> 10:27.578
I sell here all the time.

10:29.788 --> 10:31.624
You are using me to get laid?

10:31.707 --> 10:34.126
You've been cooped up
in that house for how long?

10:34.210 --> 10:37.296
Here's a chance for some exercise,
some socialising.

10:37.379 --> 10:38.964
You'll have fun.

10:39.048 --> 10:42.301
- My bones are still healing.
- No, no, you'll be fine.

10:42.343 --> 10:44.637
A lot of these guys got fucked up in Iraq

10:44.720 --> 10:47.640
and they're basically heads
on sacks of numb meat.

10:47.723 --> 10:51.060
But you, you can feel your lap,
so you got total advantage.

10:52.228 --> 10:54.772
- Ball in. One more man.
- Got him. Uh!

10:54.813 --> 10:57.316
- I don't know about this.
- Don't worry. They'll go easy.

10:57.399 --> 10:59.276
They're all high.

11:09.203 --> 11:12.122
Your hospital has got to understand one thing,

11:12.206 --> 11:15.209
I have no money.

11:16.544 --> 11:18.879
Fine, fine, turn it over
to a collection agency.

11:18.963 --> 11:20.839
They can take my fillings.

11:22.675 --> 11:24.301
Have a nice...

11:24.385 --> 11:25.886
fucking day.

11:33.602 --> 11:36.188
- I need to discuss something with you.
- Do it out there.

11:36.272 --> 11:39.441
- I'd prefer not to.
- If you think I'm gonna let you into my house

11:39.525 --> 11:41.610
after what you did...

11:44.321 --> 11:46.490
See? I have knives, too.

11:46.574 --> 11:47.825
Celia.

11:49.201 --> 11:52.162
I need to rent your empty house.

11:52.246 --> 11:55.124
- What for?
- None of your goddamn business.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.711
But... I'll make it worth your while.

11:58.794 --> 12:00.754
How worth my while?

12:04.049 --> 12:07.011
- Three grand a month.
- That doesn't even cover my nut.

12:07.094 --> 12:11.223
- Fine, four.
- You wanna do something illegal with it.

12:12.474 --> 12:14.643
- Five.
- Ten.

12:14.727 --> 12:16.478
OK.

12:16.562 --> 12:18.606
You want in on my action, you got it.

12:18.689 --> 12:21.609
We need a grow house.
Can you deal with that?

12:21.692 --> 12:23.527
Fifteen.

12:23.611 --> 12:26.530
And you have to use this house.
This house.

12:26.572 --> 12:30.367
- Your other house is empty.
- And it's also in my name.

12:30.451 --> 12:35.414
This house is still under some
Sullivan shell corp bullshit name.

12:37.416 --> 12:39.043
Slut.

12:40.711 --> 12:41.712
OK.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.843
Do we have a deal?

12:47.927 --> 12:50.012
I will have my stuff out by the end of the month.

12:50.095 --> 12:52.806
No, I need it now, as in, right now.

13:05.819 --> 13:08.906
Er, what about my furniture and...

13:10.157 --> 13:12.660
Where do you want it?
We'll move it anywhere you want.

13:12.743 --> 13:15.371
You know what, fuck it.
It's only rental crap anyway.

13:15.454 --> 13:17.623
Just... stick it outside.

13:18.541 --> 13:20.626
Hey, everything comes in here.

13:25.089 --> 13:27.341
Right, if we doin' it, let's do it.

13:27.424 --> 13:30.803
Back the truck up into the garage,
we loadin' through the kitchen.

13:32.096 --> 13:34.848
Nice to see you again, Celia.

13:34.932 --> 13:36.642
Do I know you?

13:37.768 --> 13:39.436
Probably not.

13:44.942 --> 13:48.028
- What the hell?
- We're moving back to the old house.

13:48.112 --> 13:50.364
- Why?
- Because you need to be

13:50.447 --> 13:53.576
in a more wholesome environment.

14:05.087 --> 14:07.506
- I'm Andy.
- Denise.

14:07.590 --> 14:10.593
Andy, little help.

14:11.677 --> 14:13.804
That's my buddy. I brought him.

14:13.888 --> 14:15.306
Andy?

14:16.098 --> 14:17.099
He's workin' it out.

14:17.182 --> 14:19.143
He's getting his ass kicked into Tuesday.

14:19.184 --> 14:22.813
- Oh, is it getting too hard to watch?
- Oh, no, absolutely not.

14:22.897 --> 14:25.649
Oh, really?
Like a little dirt in our sandwich, do we?

14:25.733 --> 14:28.527
It's probably all about my father.
He was an amateur boxer.

14:28.611 --> 14:32.907
Yeah. I like a little dirt in my sandwich, too.
Probably all about my mother.

14:32.990 --> 14:34.200
She was a terrible cook.

14:35.993 --> 14:38.245
Denise, come on, let's go.

14:39.288 --> 14:40.831
Gotta go.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.377
Wait!

14:45.461 --> 14:48.464
At least leave me a glass slipper, something?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.883
Come on, sis.

14:58.390 --> 15:02.436
239 West Hill Road. Pick me up at ten.

15:02.519 --> 15:05.439
Tonight?
Shit, I have a very bad short-term memory.

15:05.522 --> 15:07.483
You don't have a pen, do ya?

15:07.566 --> 15:11.487
Oh, sorry, baby. No pen.
Hope to see you later.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.873
Hi, I'm Isabelle.

15:22.957 --> 15:25.209
- Hi, Isabelle. Vaneeta.
- Heylia.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.962
Good to meet you both.
Good luck with the operation.

15:28.045 --> 15:31.423
Thank you! Ain't that a nice little girl?

15:32.466 --> 15:34.051
I think I seen her on TV.

15:35.511 --> 15:39.139
- Isn't she that Huskeroo girl?
- Yeah? She look thinner in person.

15:39.223 --> 15:43.185
- You think they pad her for that?
- Trust me, they don't pad her.

15:44.270 --> 15:47.690
Hey, you the crazy bitch drowned our weed.

15:47.815 --> 15:51.944
- The fuck you doin'?
- All right, take it easy. I'm on yo' side now.

15:54.697 --> 15:57.408
- Where do you want these, Conrad?
- Over there.

15:57.491 --> 15:59.743
Clinique, just hear me out.

15:59.827 --> 16:03.122
Ain't nothing to say, faggot,
except, "Send money. "

16:03.914 --> 16:06.125
Maybe we should get married.

16:19.096 --> 16:21.724
Uh! Uh!

16:21.807 --> 16:22.975
Where the fuck is it?

16:24.643 --> 16:26.562
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16:26.645 --> 16:31.191
What kind of man tears a cross
off the roof of a church?

16:31.275 --> 16:32.776
A house of God?

16:32.860 --> 16:35.863
An impressive one, I'm guessing.
That's a big fucking cross.

16:35.946 --> 16:38.782
It's not just a cross,
it's an $80,000 piece of art,

16:38.908 --> 16:41.452
a Nathan Arnault original, registered.

16:41.535 --> 16:45.623
So if anyone were to
try to sell it, say, it's traceable.

16:45.706 --> 16:48.417
Hey, I went to bed early tonight.
Care to join me?

16:50.920 --> 16:53.589
Ohhh... you're cute when you're mad.

16:55.591 --> 16:57.176
You're fucking with the wrong man.

16:58.177 --> 17:01.513
- I promise I'll be gentle.
- Your wife dumped you.

17:01.597 --> 17:05.392
You're living out of your goddamn office
pulling lame fraternity pranks.

17:05.476 --> 17:07.560
You're pathetic, Wilson.

17:10.271 --> 17:13.983
I'll send you a bill for that bong, Sully.
That was hand-blown glass.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.031
Everyone's taxes are gonna
smell like bong water now.

17:20.115 --> 17:21.282
Fuck.

17:28.749 --> 17:30.584
Hi.

17:32.253 --> 17:33.963
Come on in.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.300
Oh, ho ho ho!

17:38.384 --> 17:39.885
Whoa!

17:39.969 --> 17:42.471
This is Ripper. Sit.

17:44.348 --> 17:46.850
Hey, Ripper. Uh...

17:46.934 --> 17:48.769
please don't eat my remaining toes.

17:51.772 --> 17:53.440
Well...

17:53.524 --> 17:56.402
- This the guy?
- Andy, meet Chess.

17:56.485 --> 17:58.112
Hey, what's up?

17:59.655 --> 18:01.073
All righty.

18:01.991 --> 18:05.202
Ahh... look. He's got a card.

18:12.293 --> 18:13.294
Hmm.

18:13.377 --> 18:16.964
Ahh... OK. Ouch. OK.

18:17.047 --> 18:19.758
It's cool.
I'm cool, unarmed, pro-gun control.

18:19.842 --> 18:21.886
What's going on?

18:25.431 --> 18:27.933
Hey, Chess, would you like some, er...

18:28.017 --> 18:30.019
or is this disapproval

18:30.102 --> 18:32.646
that'll morph into ass-kicking?

18:32.730 --> 18:34.398
Please tell me you wanna smoke out.

18:35.858 --> 18:37.735
Ripper, come here.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.906
Oh... Ah-ha-ha.

18:41.989 --> 18:44.450
Yeah, you got a good grip there?

18:46.118 --> 18:48.078
- Where do you get it?
- Where do I get it?

18:48.204 --> 18:52.625
Er, downtown, I buy downtown,
corner of Pico and Alvarado,

18:52.708 --> 18:56.086
erm, from different guys,
whoever's on the corner.

18:56.170 --> 18:57.880
A guy named Pablo, a guy named Ortiz.

18:57.963 --> 18:59.381
There's Ramón, too.

19:00.883 --> 19:04.345
Ramón's got a scar across his forehead...
Knife wound, self-inflected.

19:06.388 --> 19:07.389
So the story goes.

19:08.474 --> 19:10.976
Pablo plays mandolin,
same song over and over.

19:11.060 --> 19:14.021
- Maybe I can save you a trip.
- Really? How's that?

19:14.104 --> 19:16.357
Denise, hold Ripper.

19:18.692 --> 19:20.069
Come here. Sit.

19:20.152 --> 19:23.489
Denise, new friend of mine,

19:23.572 --> 19:25.574
what the fuck is goin' on?

19:25.658 --> 19:27.910
Don't worry. It's all cool.

19:30.454 --> 19:31.539
Hey, look at that.

19:36.043 --> 19:38.546
So, you wanna buy from me?

19:39.922 --> 19:43.133
You know, I'm good right now,
but if I'm ever running low...

19:43.217 --> 19:45.302
I'll tell you what,

19:45.386 --> 19:49.974
why don't you let Ms Botwin know
it's available if she's interested?

19:50.057 --> 19:51.809
I mean, after all, we're local.

19:53.227 --> 19:55.729
- It's the right thing to do.
- Right, yeah.

19:55.813 --> 19:57.731
Makes perfect sense. I'll tell the boss.

19:58.607 --> 20:00.150
OK.

20:00.234 --> 20:02.486
- You can go now.
- But, er...

20:02.570 --> 20:04.405
Denise'll call you.

20:04.488 --> 20:06.031
She thinks you're funny.

20:06.115 --> 20:08.576
Oh. OK, then.

20:11.036 --> 20:13.330
- This was fun.
- Ain't done yet.

20:14.373 --> 20:19.253
Gotta get rid of that generator,
figure out a way to tap the power lines,

20:19.336 --> 20:23.549
surround the house with rosemary,
lavender, ward off the smell.

20:24.300 --> 20:27.469
We got a whole fucking load
of work ahead of us.

20:28.470 --> 20:31.181
Can't we just move them back
after the fire marshal comes?

20:31.265 --> 20:34.685
Not for at least two weeks.
We lost 20 in the move.

20:34.768 --> 20:39.106
This here's like a halfway house
for traumatised plants.

20:39.189 --> 20:40.774
Gotta let 'em relax awhile.

20:41.567 --> 20:43.527
You can use my crew if you want.

20:43.611 --> 20:45.821
Might have to.

20:45.905 --> 20:49.408
Don't know how the family
gonna take to commuting.

20:49.491 --> 20:52.077
Heylia gets carsick,
Vaneeta's got road rage.

20:52.161 --> 20:55.915
Mm, there goes our road trip to Las Vegas.

20:58.834 --> 21:03.339
What about you? You OK?
You need a place to sleep?

21:03.422 --> 21:04.673
Sleep?

21:06.425 --> 21:09.261
I'm a black man living on a golf course.

21:09.345 --> 21:12.431
I'm about to spark up the barbecue,
make mojitos.

21:18.646 --> 21:20.898
How's Silas doing?

21:22.191 --> 21:23.859
Boy's gifted.

21:26.403 --> 21:28.614
Got a future if he chooses to go this way.

21:31.158 --> 21:32.326
Yeah.

21:40.376 --> 21:42.461
Do you think I'm a bad person?

21:45.756 --> 21:48.300
I don't think you're a bad person.

21:51.387 --> 21:53.180
No?

21:53.264 --> 21:54.848
No.

21:57.851 --> 21:59.103
Thanks.
