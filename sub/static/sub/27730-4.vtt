WEBVTT

00:08.443 --> 00:09.966
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:10.010 --> 00:12.360
BURNHAM: With theEnterprise
in Spacedock,

00:12.403 --> 00:14.275
Captain Pike
andDiscovery's mission

00:14.318 --> 00:16.190
to find any
rational explanation

00:16.233 --> 00:17.930
for the seven signals
continues to escape me.

00:17.974 --> 00:19.584
And with it, perhaps,
any chance

00:19.628 --> 00:21.456
of a relationship
with my brother Spock.

00:21.499 --> 00:24.937
Computer, show me Starfleet's
rendering of the seven signals.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.200
Spock drew these signals

00:26.243 --> 00:28.202
two months
before they appeared to us.

00:28.245 --> 00:29.681
It's damn near identical.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.555
BURNHAM:
Amanda?

00:33.598 --> 00:35.470
: I stole
Spock's medical file.

00:35.513 --> 00:37.559
I've been waiting for an update
on my officer, Spock.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.430
Your guy is wanted for murder.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.563
Killed three of his doctors,
then fled the starbase.

00:41.606 --> 00:44.000
AMANDA: I thought
that he had left it in the past,

00:44.044 --> 00:45.610
but it's back.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.613
What is it?Your brother called it
the Red Angel.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.572
That vision changed him forever.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.226
It wasn't because of a vision.

00:52.269 --> 00:55.403
It was because of me.What did you do?

00:55.446 --> 00:56.404
I will find him.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.232
No.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.147
I will.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.498
Got it.

01:03.541 --> 01:04.934
TILLY: After the dark matter hit me...

01:04.977 --> 01:07.763
It's me. ...I started to see a ghost.

01:07.806 --> 01:09.852
Her name was May,
but she's dead.Tilly.

01:09.895 --> 01:11.984
I am losing it, Michael.BURNHAM:
You don't need sickbay.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.812
You need Stamets. We should have results

01:13.856 --> 01:15.118
in one second.There he is.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.251
That's the captain.
That's where he flies.

01:17.294 --> 01:18.774
Just as I suspected.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.733
You are hosting a
eukaryotic organism.A fungus?

01:21.777 --> 01:23.996
This might hurt a bit.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.657
Security breach by unknown
alien species in Engineering.

01:32.701 --> 01:35.834
Engage quarantine protocol
Alpha-Omega.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.840
Energize.

01:41.884 --> 01:43.103
Teleporter incoming.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.770
Captain.Welcome aboard Discovery,
Number One.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.338
The failures cascaded
through all our primaries.

02:01.382 --> 02:04.124
Helm, nav, both impulse
and warp drive. Chief Louvier

02:04.167 --> 02:06.082
has an engineering team
working 'round the clock.

02:06.126 --> 02:08.476
I don't think Enterprisewill
ever have a chief engineer

02:08.519 --> 02:09.824
more in love with his ship.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.479
Apparently,
Enterpriseis the only ship

02:11.522 --> 02:13.002
in the fleet
that's had any problems.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.134
You know, he warned me.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.657
The damn
holographic comm system.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.180
Tell Louvier to rip
out the entire system.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.616
From now on we'll communicate

02:18.660 --> 02:20.052
using good,
old-fashioned viewscreens.

02:20.096 --> 02:21.663
Truth is I never liked
the holograms.

02:21.706 --> 02:23.491
They look too much like ghosts.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.667
He told you I'd say that.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.799
No. I told him.

02:27.843 --> 02:29.801
Cheeseburger. Fries.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.674
Habanero sauce.You want to order
some lighter fluid with that?

02:32.717 --> 02:33.675
That goes with the shake.

02:33.718 --> 02:36.199
Sorry to keep you in Spacedock.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.635
I've made use of
the time, Captain.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.464
You've been looking into
the allegations against Spock.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.858
It's hard to comprehend,
let alone believe,

02:42.901 --> 02:44.642
that he murdered three people

02:44.686 --> 02:47.297
at the psychiatric
facility on Starbase Five.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.342
How's the crew taking it?

02:48.385 --> 02:49.908
They don't know the details.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.432
Only that he's in trouble.

02:53.347 --> 02:55.349
There's something else.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.394
Tell me.

02:57.438 --> 03:01.703
Starfleet's classified
his case Level One.

03:01.746 --> 03:04.184
Line officers don't usually
warrant that kind of scrutiny.

03:04.227 --> 03:06.838
It's unprecedented. Which is why
I've done a little digging.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.100
Sanctioned?

03:08.144 --> 03:10.190
Better you don't know the answer
to that.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.322
Before I look at that,

03:12.366 --> 03:15.717
I need to know why you saw fit
to detour Federation protocols.

03:15.760 --> 03:19.329
Something about this
investigation isn't adding up.

03:19.373 --> 03:21.897
I'm not letting him go
without a fight.

03:21.940 --> 03:24.204
As usual, we agree.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.597
MALE OFFICER :
Captain Pike to the ready room.

03:26.641 --> 03:29.687
I'm late for a briefing.
I'm glad you came.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.254
I'm sorry you can't stay longer.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.256
Next time.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.866
Be careful, Captain.

03:34.910 --> 03:37.217
You, too, Number One.

03:43.745 --> 03:46.051
We should give it a name.

03:46.095 --> 03:47.792
Other than May.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.101
I know it looks like a blob,

03:52.144 --> 03:54.277
but this is one of the most
sophisticated life-forms

03:54.321 --> 03:55.800
I've ever encountered.

03:55.844 --> 03:58.890
It has sentience,
intention.

03:58.934 --> 04:02.285
Tilly, the mycelial network
doesn't just connect life.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.113
It contains it.

04:04.156 --> 04:05.506
It's an incubator.

04:05.549 --> 04:08.813
You mean, like,
um... like a home?

04:13.644 --> 04:17.257
I've been wondering why
it appeared to me as May,

04:17.300 --> 04:18.867
which got me thinking
about the real May

04:18.910 --> 04:20.825
that I met when I was, um, 14.

04:22.349 --> 04:25.439
I was, um... I was a weird kid.

04:25.482 --> 04:27.963
: You know?
Like, not a lot of friends

04:28.006 --> 04:31.967
and nobody who really
believed in me, including me.

04:32.010 --> 04:35.753
But... she did.

04:35.797 --> 04:40.323
She wanted to connect to
me, and she tried so hard.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.107
But I don't really think

04:42.151 --> 04:43.805
I was the friend to
her that she needed.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.415
I'm certain

04:45.459 --> 04:47.983
you were much kinder than
you give yourself credit for.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.333
You always are.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.770
Thank you, but...

04:52.814 --> 04:56.252
I didn't even know she died.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.080
I feel like I took her
for granted.

04:58.123 --> 05:00.952
That girl
who thought I was special.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.172
Oh!

05:07.045 --> 05:10.222
I've cross-referenced
what we're calling the Red Angel

05:10.266 --> 05:11.485
with all known winged

05:11.528 --> 05:13.356
and avian life-forms
in the Federation.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.662
So far, I've found nothing.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.882
Sorry.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.668
The universal translator
sometimes has trouble

05:20.711 --> 05:23.192
reconfiguring my lingual
clicks and pops.

05:23.235 --> 05:26.500
My answer to you was, "Nothing
in the known universe."

05:26.543 --> 05:28.502
Which might suggest
it's not a species.

05:28.545 --> 05:31.374
Maybe one of a kind.A mutation.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.376
Well, whatever it is,
figuring out how it's connected

05:33.420 --> 05:35.726
to these signals
will help us identify it.

05:35.770 --> 05:38.076
If only we knew what it needs.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.689
Commander Nhan, USS Enterprise.

05:41.732 --> 05:42.864
Glad to be here.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.387
Welcome back aboard.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.867
Could you pass the salt?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.695
Commander Saru,

05:47.738 --> 05:49.392
can you shed any light?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.394
My apologies.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.396
I woke up this morning fighting

05:53.440 --> 05:55.050
an acute rhinovirus.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.225
So you have a cold.

05:56.268 --> 05:59.750
I had a cold last week,
which sucked.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.928
Saurian. Six nasal canals.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.930
It happens to the best of us,
Linus.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.932
Everyone to your stations.
Detmer, set a course

06:07.976 --> 06:10.500
for 108 mark four.
Maximum warp.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.675
Aye, sir.

06:11.719 --> 06:13.895
Mr. Saru, you look like hell.

06:13.938 --> 06:15.331
You've been burning the candle
at both ends lately.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.419
Go get some rest.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.682
As you wish, sir.

06:18.726 --> 06:22.425
Burnham. A word.

06:22.469 --> 06:26.647
I understand your first officer
is on her way to Spacedock.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.649
Was her visit informative?

06:28.692 --> 06:30.302
Number One is very resourceful.

06:30.346 --> 06:33.131
People have a tendency
to end up owing her favors.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.264
She uncovered

06:35.307 --> 06:37.484
some classified information

06:37.527 --> 06:38.702
on Starbase Five.

06:38.746 --> 06:41.139
That is the warp signature
of the shuttle

06:41.183 --> 06:43.359
that Spock stole
from the psychiatric facility.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.622
I put us on an intercept course.

06:45.666 --> 06:48.495
We should reach his position
in the next few hours.

06:53.195 --> 06:55.284
S-Sir,

06:55.327 --> 06:57.765
after everything
that's happened,

06:57.808 --> 07:01.508
I need to excuse myself
from seeing Spock.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.423
Not sure I follow.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.642
I don't want
to make things worse for him.

07:05.686 --> 07:10.473
He's a fugitive,
whatever the circumstances.

07:10.517 --> 07:14.346
And as Amanda suggested...

07:14.390 --> 07:16.610
I'm probably the last person

07:16.653 --> 07:19.482
who should insert themselves
into this problem.

07:19.526 --> 07:22.746
I disagree.He is lost, Captain.

07:22.790 --> 07:26.184
You are better suited
to help him.

07:27.795 --> 07:30.014
I've thought this through.

07:30.058 --> 07:34.497
Please, trust me.

07:34.541 --> 07:37.500
My abiding trust in you

07:37.544 --> 07:40.155
doesn't eclipse
the mission at hand.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.026
Facing whatever happened
to Spock,

07:42.070 --> 07:44.289
it's not gonna be easy
for any of us.

07:44.333 --> 07:48.206
Reaching him
has to be the priority.

07:53.647 --> 07:55.039
Detmer, status?

07:55.083 --> 07:56.650
Something has grabbed us
out of warp, sir.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.216
Speed dropping to sub-light.

07:58.260 --> 07:59.827
Helm going unresponsive.PIKE:
Shields up.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.132
Red alert. Owosekun,

08:01.176 --> 08:02.177
are we talking tractor beam?

08:02.220 --> 08:03.352
More powerful than that, sir.

08:03.395 --> 08:05.223
I'm unable to raise shields.

08:05.267 --> 08:08.531
Preliminary analysis indicates
a multiphasic stasis field.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.141
It's disrupting
our shield harmonics.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.795
DETMER: We're at
a full stop, sir.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.145
Whatever has us,
w-we're locked into place.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.799
Like a damn fly in a web.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.889
And there is the spider.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.560
BURNHAM: Starfleet has never
encountered anything like it.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.562
565 kilometers in diameter

10:06.606 --> 10:11.045
with a mass of 6.39 x 10 to
the 20th power kilograms.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.874
It melds organic and
nonliving matter.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.571
It's also ancient.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.662
Initial scans put it
at 100,000 years old.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.098
"Organic"?

10:21.142 --> 10:22.970
Are you saying it's
some kind of a life-form?

10:23.013 --> 10:25.712
Maybe it is a damn spider.
I hate spiders.

10:25.755 --> 10:27.322
It is premature to assign

10:27.365 --> 10:29.498
any anthropomorphic
distinction or intent.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.718
As of yet, it hasn't
responded to any hails.

10:31.761 --> 10:34.111
But there is this.

10:34.155 --> 10:36.766
The sphere is vibrating.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.508
The computer extrapolated
what it might sound like

10:39.551 --> 10:41.641
based on the surrounding
ambient radiation.

10:43.686 --> 10:45.601
Well, it has my ship,

10:45.645 --> 10:47.124
and I don't know what
in the hell it wants.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.431
Communicate with it or
disable it. And quickly, please.

11:15.631 --> 11:16.719
BRYCE:
Captain Pike.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.596
Saru.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.385
COMPUTER:
Confirmed.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.778
Did it work?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.562
Yes. I can understand you.

12:17.606 --> 12:18.563
DETMER: I still can't
read my controls.

12:18.607 --> 12:21.218
I think this is Tau Cetian.

12:21.262 --> 12:23.699
Am I the only one who bothered
to learn a foreign language?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.614
I have localized

12:25.657 --> 12:27.834
the backup bridge translator.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.487
For the time being,

12:29.531 --> 12:32.142
everyone who speaks
Earth English can communicate.

12:32.186 --> 12:34.797
The rest of the crew and
Discovery'scomputer
are another matter.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.756
The bridge may be
temporarily fixed, but
the virus will continue

12:36.799 --> 12:37.887
spreading through
our comms system.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.802
I can try purging it

12:39.846 --> 12:41.064
from the translator's
main interface.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.762
We have to be able to talk
to the computer

12:42.805 --> 12:44.415
and the rest of the crew
to have any chance

12:44.459 --> 12:45.808
of breaking free
from that sphere. Do it.

12:45.852 --> 12:46.809
Yes, sir.

12:48.289 --> 12:50.770
I'll go. You should stay
and monitor bridge stations.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.685
I have placed all systems
on... automatic.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.513
And given
our current circumstances,

12:55.557 --> 12:58.908
you will need a translator
just to operate the turbolift.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.128
Are you sure you can do this?We are wasting time.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.305
We've run
a full diagnostic, Captain,

13:04.348 --> 13:06.437
and this section
remains unaffected by the virus.

13:06.481 --> 13:08.439
I will update you
if anything changes.

13:08.483 --> 13:09.963
PIKE:
Thank you, Ensign.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.703
If we can't fly this thing,
Commander,

13:11.747 --> 13:13.836
we may have to jump away.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.838
The spore drive
will be ready, sir.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.535
Bring the drive online,

13:17.579 --> 13:19.537
and then we'll couple
the shunts to me,

13:19.581 --> 13:21.844
in case we've got
to skedaddle.

13:26.196 --> 13:29.852
♪ Da, da, da,
da, da, da. ♪

13:29.896 --> 13:33.943
The universal translator
for this section is no más.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.466
Can I... help you?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.686
Uh, unless you can reroute
the plasma regulator

13:37.729 --> 13:40.471
to silo off the relay
junction, then,

13:40.515 --> 13:41.995
uh, no.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.039
You're, um...?

13:43.083 --> 13:44.606
Jett Reno, from the Hiawatha.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.043
I hitched a ride
off that asteroid.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.437
Chief engineer sent me
to firewall off

13:49.480 --> 13:51.352
the critical
propulsion systems.

13:51.395 --> 13:53.006
I didn't realize a greenhouse

13:53.049 --> 13:54.790
could be "critical"
or"propulsive,"

13:54.834 --> 13:56.226
but, hmm, what do I know?

13:56.270 --> 13:57.880
I'm just a gearhead,
not a farmer.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.882
STAMETS:
A... farmer.

13:59.926 --> 14:03.407
Oh, please, let us know
what you think, because we care.

14:03.451 --> 14:05.235
You should.
Antimatter and dilithium

14:05.279 --> 14:08.282
might be old-school,
but they don't let you down.

14:08.325 --> 14:10.545
Why soar when you can crawl?

14:10.588 --> 14:12.460
You don't know me, Doc.
I'm un-insultable.

14:12.503 --> 14:15.506
Especially by a guy
who thinks he can run a ship

14:15.550 --> 14:18.205
on mushrooms
that I pick off my pizza.

14:18.248 --> 14:20.033
Spores are clean, renewable.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.425
Yeah, do they come
with house dressing?

14:23.601 --> 14:25.429
Do you have any idea
how many planets

14:25.473 --> 14:27.562
have been ruined
by dilithium mining?

14:27.605 --> 14:29.216
How many battles
were fought

14:29.259 --> 14:31.392
to corner its supply?
Of course you don't.

14:31.435 --> 14:33.263
You're one of those people
who never even consider it.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.353
And you're one of those people
that does the ha-ha jokey thing

14:36.397 --> 14:38.181
and then gets all huffy
and in high dudgeon

14:38.225 --> 14:40.227
when you can't think
of a comeback.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.576
Do you have gum?

14:41.619 --> 14:43.839
Grape. I...

14:43.883 --> 14:45.188
You know, it was only a
couple centuries ago that

14:45.232 --> 14:47.190
the Earth nearly choked
to death on pollution.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.976
Then we all woke up,
and within a generation,

14:50.019 --> 14:51.978
everything from a
truck to a toaster...

14:52.021 --> 14:53.153
Do you want...
Sorry. Sorry

14:53.196 --> 14:54.981
...was covered
in solar panels.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.853
Yesterday's solar panels
are today's fungi.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.420
Hmm.
I can fix stuff

14:59.463 --> 15:01.901
with duct tape,
if you want.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.990
Do you think May had anything
to do with the sphere?

15:04.033 --> 15:06.514
What a giant entity
from our universe

15:06.557 --> 15:09.125
and a mycelial species
from the network?

15:09.169 --> 15:10.474
Well, they have
as much in common

15:10.518 --> 15:12.215
as me and that grease monkey.

15:12.259 --> 15:14.261
I could fix that analogy
with duct tape, too.

15:33.323 --> 15:34.846
Burnham to bridge.
The universal translator

15:34.890 --> 15:37.240
is back up and running ship-wide
on all systems.

15:38.502 --> 15:42.332
Saru! What is going on?

15:42.376 --> 15:44.160
This is not just a cold.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.469
No, it is not.

15:55.911 --> 15:56.956
What's that hum?

15:56.999 --> 15:58.740
Get down!

16:06.443 --> 16:09.490
Okay, there's more
where that came from.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.579
We've got a hundred-
giga-electron volts

16:11.622 --> 16:13.407
surging through
the local relays.

16:13.450 --> 16:14.843
Computer's isolated
the compartment

16:14.886 --> 16:16.845
in order to contain the damage.

16:16.888 --> 16:18.934
We've still got
our life support.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.936
Yeah, but...
it could kill us.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.244
If our oxygen ignites,
we'll cook like french fries.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.420
Well, we could divert
the power to act like a...

16:26.463 --> 16:28.465
a-a lightning arrestor.We could use
the door

16:28.509 --> 16:30.163
as a ground.

16:30.206 --> 16:32.774
Then the surge would
dissipate through the frame

16:32.817 --> 16:35.037
of the ship.
The question is,

16:35.081 --> 16:38.127
how do we conduct the surge
from there to there?

16:38.171 --> 16:40.086
No, a gas could,
once it ionizes.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.175
I infuse the spores
with an argon-xenon mixture

16:42.218 --> 16:43.959
to slow decay.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.961
We could link up
the canisters

16:46.005 --> 16:48.050
to contain the gas,
our version of a lightning rod.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.052
That's actually
not a stupid idea.

16:50.096 --> 16:52.054
It's my version
of the house dressing,

16:52.098 --> 16:54.622
but it saves your life.
Huh.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.319
Bridge. What happened?

16:56.363 --> 16:57.494
Did the sphere fire on us?

16:57.538 --> 16:58.539
OWOSEKUN:
Negative.

16:58.582 --> 16:59.714
EPS conduits are overloading.

16:59.757 --> 17:00.715
Systems are going haywire.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.543
The virus is spreading.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.153
What is happening
to the ship?

17:04.196 --> 17:06.155
We... have to get
to the bridge.No, no, no, no, no.

17:06.199 --> 17:08.592
Right now
we got to get you to sickbay.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.551
Gas her up.

17:16.599 --> 17:19.820
Gas transference at 100%.You're gonna do that manually?

17:19.864 --> 17:22.084
Uh, yeah,
'cause obviously you're not.

17:22.127 --> 17:23.520
Flick the switch.

17:32.225 --> 17:34.183
Are you okay?

17:34.227 --> 17:35.880
I feel like
I've been hit by lightning

17:35.924 --> 17:37.534
for the second time this week.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.754
Reno?

17:39.797 --> 17:42.583
Reno? Reno, are
you all right?

17:42.626 --> 17:44.106
Weird... dream.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.674
I was playing drums for Prince,

17:46.717 --> 17:48.502
and there were doves
and a parade.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.373
Okeydoke.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.160
Wait.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.552
It's gone.

18:00.992 --> 18:01.950
Tilly!

18:02.864 --> 18:03.952
She won't let...

18:03.995 --> 18:05.084
she won't let go!

18:05.127 --> 18:06.041
She won't let go.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.881
What's happening to him?

18:19.924 --> 18:21.970
I'm hoping Dr.
Pollard can tell us.

18:22.013 --> 18:25.278
Well, comms is down, so I need
to see what the situation is

18:25.321 --> 18:27.149
in sickbay, anyway.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.498
POLLARD:
Triage plasma burns
on level one.

18:28.542 --> 18:30.196
Send non-critical
to sickbay two.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.197
PIKE:
Doctor.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.981
POLLARD:
Bring him here.

18:33.024 --> 18:36.158
Elevated heart rate,

18:36.202 --> 18:37.507
spiking adrenal levels,

18:37.551 --> 18:39.205
increased
neural activity.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.033
The pain would render the
average humanoid unconscious.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.515
What do we do
about those?

18:45.559 --> 18:47.996
Nothing.
It is an effect of...

18:48.039 --> 18:49.693
my condition.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.482
Ocular discomfort?

18:55.525 --> 18:57.527
No. Kelpiens can see
far deeper

18:57.571 --> 18:59.703
into th-the light spectrum
than humans.

18:59.747 --> 19:02.010
I keep seeing flashes
of ultraviolet light,

19:02.053 --> 19:03.533
invisible to you, but...
quite the opposite

19:03.577 --> 19:05.013
for me.Are these symptoms

19:05.056 --> 19:06.362
common among Kelpiens?

19:06.406 --> 19:08.669
This is pointless.
And the ship is being

19:08.712 --> 19:11.150
further immobilized
as we waste time.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.456
There is no reason to believe
the sphere is benevolent.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.979
Now, please...

19:15.023 --> 19:16.067
Commander.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.635
Dr. Pollard is
trying to help you.

19:21.812 --> 19:25.642
Yes. It is unique
to my people,

19:25.686 --> 19:27.905
and it is terminal.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.912
Are you certain?

19:34.956 --> 19:37.350
I have never been more certain
of anything in my life.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.786
When I awoke

19:38.829 --> 19:40.353
in discomfort this morning...

19:41.876 --> 19:45.793
I hoped it was just...
a passing cold.

19:45.836 --> 19:48.883
But now I have
to face the truth.

19:48.926 --> 19:51.494
I do not understand why...

19:51.538 --> 19:53.192
but I am beginning to think that

19:53.235 --> 19:55.150
the sphere is...
is triggering

19:55.194 --> 19:57.892
the Kelpien biological
process known as...

19:57.935 --> 20:00.199
Vahar'ai.

20:00.242 --> 20:02.897
It is the event that signals

20:02.940 --> 20:06.205
when Kelpiens are ready to be...

20:06.248 --> 20:10.296
culled for slaughter by...
the Ba'ul,

20:10.339 --> 20:12.733
the predator species
on my homeworld

20:12.776 --> 20:13.995
of Kaminar.

20:14.038 --> 20:16.040
But there are
no Ba'ul here.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.217
It does not matter.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.306
Kelpien ganglia only enflame

20:20.349 --> 20:25.006
in this manner...
as we near our end.

20:25.049 --> 20:26.573
I am a...

20:26.616 --> 20:28.836
a slave to my biology.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.926
We are not gonna let you die.

20:31.969 --> 20:34.276
There has to be something

20:34.320 --> 20:35.756
that we can do.

20:35.799 --> 20:37.497
There is not.

20:37.540 --> 20:40.151
Kelpiens
undergoing Vahar'ai

20:40.195 --> 20:42.893
either die in the culling

20:42.937 --> 20:46.854
or... are driven to madness
by the effects

20:46.897 --> 20:48.769
of Vahar'ai.
Either way,

20:48.812 --> 20:51.815
death is inevitable.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.646
STAMETS: The mycelial entity
has attached itself to Tilly.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.692
We're trying to free her.
Engineering to bridge.

20:59.736 --> 21:01.651
Engineering to bridge.
Come in.

21:01.695 --> 21:03.262
Comms are down.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.480
Along with most of the ship.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.399
TILLY:
Don't feel bad.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.272
I know you have to
keep me in quarantine.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.925
Or us.

21:14.969 --> 21:17.319
I feel a
little weird.

21:17.363 --> 21:19.278
I should...

21:19.321 --> 21:21.976
I should be terrified,
but I'm not.

21:22.019 --> 21:25.109
May means me no harm.

21:25.153 --> 21:27.198
Are you able to see May again?

21:27.242 --> 21:29.636
How do you know this is benign?

21:29.679 --> 21:32.334
May was scary,
and she was clingy, and she,

21:32.378 --> 21:34.684
like, never shut up, but...

21:34.728 --> 21:36.512
she never hurt me.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.036
She said she had a plan for me.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.517
She said that I was
her only chance.

21:41.561 --> 21:43.693
Did you ever think
she was manipulating you?

21:43.737 --> 21:46.000
That's what she said youwere
doing-- she said that you...

21:46.043 --> 21:48.045
you were trying to
poison me against her.

21:48.089 --> 21:50.439
Okay, if that thing
wasn't freaking me out, sheis.

21:50.483 --> 21:53.050
The blob seems to be secreting
a psilocybin hallucinogen

21:53.094 --> 21:54.661
to influence her emotions.

21:54.704 --> 21:55.618
RENO:
So you're saying

21:55.662 --> 21:56.706
she's on a bad trip?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.055
Or maybe it's just trying

21:58.099 --> 22:00.449
to calm her down
so she won't be scared.

22:00.493 --> 22:02.712
Or so she won't fight back?

22:07.543 --> 22:10.546
BURNHAM:
If Saru thinks
that somehow the...

22:10.590 --> 22:13.636
the sphere
triggered Vahar'ai,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.943
maybe escaping its grip would
stop what's happening to him.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.248
The problem is
freeing ourselves

22:17.292 --> 22:18.815
before it
destroys the ship.

22:18.859 --> 22:20.991
If it wanted to destroy us,
why the slow attack?

22:21.035 --> 22:22.776
It's inefficient, right?

22:22.819 --> 22:24.430
It must need something.

22:24.473 --> 22:26.823
It's taking what it needs.
Without the computer,

22:26.867 --> 22:30.131
all our primary systems begin to
fail, including the warp core.

22:30.174 --> 22:32.481
The EPS grid's unstable,
and it's cutting off

22:32.525 --> 22:35.092
entire sections,
including Engineering.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.268
Life support's down to 60%,
but who's counting?

22:37.312 --> 22:40.402
It is not logical
for a virus to kill its host.

22:40.446 --> 22:43.362
You're attaching a known medical
diagnosis to an unknown entity.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.928
SARU: There may
be a way to...

22:44.972 --> 22:46.190
slow the virus.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.628
If we can analyze
its properties,

22:48.671 --> 22:52.414
we may be able to develop
digital antibodies.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.677
That could give us back enough
control to break the ship free.

22:54.721 --> 22:55.591
SARU: In theory,
but it will be

22:55.635 --> 22:57.288
a slow process, like...

22:57.332 --> 22:59.769
army ants eating
a water buffalo.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.684
I'm on it.
Going to the science lab.

23:01.728 --> 23:03.120
You will need my help.

23:03.164 --> 23:05.427
PIKE:
Saru, Commander Burnham
can handle this.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.387
There's no reason to risk
your health any further.I...

23:08.430 --> 23:10.824
am dying, Captain...

23:10.867 --> 23:14.480
but I am most
certainly not... dead.

23:21.182 --> 23:22.792
The antibodies

23:22.836 --> 23:25.273
are s-slowing
the virus's progress.

23:25.316 --> 23:28.842
Life support at 47%.

23:31.932 --> 23:34.891
You are wondering
why I kept this from you.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.855
You don't have
to bear it alone.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.815
How...

23:45.859 --> 23:48.122
do I explain...

23:48.165 --> 23:50.429
to the woman
who has fought

23:50.472 --> 23:54.433
over and over for the right
to take her next breath

23:54.476 --> 23:59.350
that I come from a race
that submits?

23:59.394 --> 24:01.396
I'm your friend.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.314
There will never be
judgment between us.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.577
Well, to my shame...

24:08.621 --> 24:10.927
hiding is my nature.

24:14.670 --> 24:17.064
I have learned
multiple languages,

24:17.107 --> 24:19.501
yet never shared my own,

24:19.545 --> 24:23.070
fearful of revealing
my own...

24:23.113 --> 24:25.202
alienness.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.032
May I...

24:29.076 --> 24:31.034
request a favor?

24:31.078 --> 24:33.080
Of course.

24:33.123 --> 24:35.038
Anything.

24:35.082 --> 24:38.694
I have kept
detailed personal logs

24:38.738 --> 24:41.262
since joining Starfleet.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.699
I would ask you...

24:43.743 --> 24:47.050
to officially catalogue them,
so that when...

24:47.094 --> 24:51.402
General Order 1 no longer
applies to the Kelpiens...

24:51.446 --> 24:54.405
they will know
a journey like mine...

24:54.449 --> 24:55.929
is possible.

24:55.972 --> 24:58.627
It would be my privilege.

25:01.151 --> 25:04.111
Did you record your life
before Starfleet?

25:04.154 --> 25:06.896
Uh, you might say
my life began

25:06.940 --> 25:10.944
when I was granted refugee
status by the Federation.

25:10.987 --> 25:14.164
While being processed
at Starbase Seven...

25:16.427 --> 25:19.039
...I saw for the first time

25:19.082 --> 25:23.696
life-forms
from across the universe,

25:23.739 --> 25:26.568
some with less than I had,

25:26.612 --> 25:29.832
yet, with a dream

25:29.876 --> 25:31.965
of something better.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.969
I listened.

25:38.449 --> 25:42.062
Every story I heard...

25:42.105 --> 25:45.500
...created... a space inside me

25:45.544 --> 25:49.069
to feel more, to...

25:49.112 --> 25:51.724
lovemore.

25:53.464 --> 25:56.467
I joined Starfleet

25:56.511 --> 25:58.774
to help those in need

25:58.818 --> 26:01.864
the way I was helped.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.910
You are...

26:03.953 --> 26:06.086
the most empathicsoul...

26:06.129 --> 26:08.131
I know.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.746
There was just one...

26:13.789 --> 26:16.575
painful caveat to my signing up.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.146
I could never return home.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.148
Why?

26:25.192 --> 26:27.150
Oh.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.152
More flashes
of ultraviolet light.

26:29.196 --> 26:31.633
They are... growing

26:31.677 --> 26:34.157
in... strength and frequency.

26:34.201 --> 26:36.638
I'll get something from sickbay.No. No.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.510
I will be fine.

26:39.554 --> 26:41.164
The captain asked you

26:41.208 --> 26:43.514
to return to the bridge
as soon as possible.

26:43.558 --> 26:46.039
I can continue
the work here.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.346
OWOSEKUN: Spock is still
at maximum warp, Captain.

26:49.390 --> 26:51.174
If we're stuck here much longer,
we're going to lose him.

26:51.218 --> 26:52.175
Reallocate power
from the transporters

26:52.219 --> 26:53.612
to long-range sensors.

26:53.655 --> 26:54.961
I don't want to lose contact
with his shuttle.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.658
Even with sensors at max,
we won't be able

26:56.702 --> 26:58.660
to track him for much longer.Contact Engineering.

26:58.704 --> 27:00.662
See if they can reroute
impulse power to the deflectors.

27:00.706 --> 27:02.664
If we can raise shields,
we might be able

27:02.708 --> 27:04.666
to disrupt the stasis field
just enough to break free.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.276
If so, can we
jump away?

27:06.320 --> 27:08.148
Negative, sir.
We don't have enough power

27:08.191 --> 27:09.889
to create the necessary
hull cavitation.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.673
Comms are still down
in Engineering, sir.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.066
Security protocols
are also malfunctioning,

27:13.109 --> 27:14.676
locking off parts
of the ship.

27:14.720 --> 27:16.069
How are we doing, Commander?

27:16.112 --> 27:17.548
The digital antibodies
are doing their job,

27:17.592 --> 27:18.898
but progress is sluggish.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.682
I'm running out of options.

27:20.726 --> 27:23.293
If we lose Spock, we lose
any chance of protecting him.

27:23.337 --> 27:25.295
Permission to go to Engineering.

27:25.339 --> 27:26.775
We can't talk to
them here, but maybe

27:26.819 --> 27:28.298
I can help them
get power to shields.

27:28.342 --> 27:29.735
Permission granted.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.877
What's wrong?The doors won't open,

27:41.921 --> 27:45.315
and that thing reattached
itself to Tilly.Can you detach it?

27:45.359 --> 27:47.709
I could cut it off. She wouldn't
even lose a freckle.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.232
Bad idea.

27:49.276 --> 27:52.148
If it's a symbiote,
removing it might kill her.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.759
Well, thanks for stopping by.

27:53.802 --> 27:56.239
I came to see if we can find a
way to boost power to shields.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.588
No. With the systems
fluctuating,

27:57.632 --> 27:58.938
this section is partitioned off.

27:58.981 --> 28:00.330
We can't get to the warp core.

28:00.374 --> 28:01.941
Michael...

28:06.641 --> 28:09.383
I feel really tired.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.427
What is happening?

28:10.471 --> 28:11.646
That blob is sending her

28:11.690 --> 28:12.952
in and out of consciousness.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.605
Why is it doing that to her?

28:14.649 --> 28:16.869
It's not like we can ask it.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.958
Actually, we can.

28:20.786 --> 28:22.222
This is a harmonic interface.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.093
It-it links my neurons
to the mycelial network.

28:24.137 --> 28:25.791
With modification,

28:25.834 --> 28:28.663
it could link May to Tilly's
central nervous system.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.100
Let May speak
using Tilly's mouth.

28:31.144 --> 28:33.276
Wait. What did you say?

28:33.320 --> 28:34.713
We're gonna talk to it.

28:34.756 --> 28:36.671
We need it to tell
us what it wants.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.412
So do we.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.762
The sphere-- it's been trying
to tell us something,

28:40.806 --> 28:42.721
and we haven't been listening.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.418
Well, damn, woman, go!We got her.

28:45.854 --> 28:47.464
Saru,

28:47.508 --> 28:49.815
could the sphere be
trying to talk to us?

28:49.858 --> 28:52.774
Using the virus as a way
to make first contact?

29:01.304 --> 29:05.265
Yeah. Yes, of course.
I've been so blind.

29:08.529 --> 29:11.706
The ultraviolet wavelengths
are repeating, like...

29:11.750 --> 29:13.360
like letters would in...

29:13.403 --> 29:15.536
in a sentence...
everywhere.

29:15.579 --> 29:18.017
Okay, Saru. Saru, stop.
You're hurting yourself.

29:18.060 --> 29:19.888
No, no. No.

29:19.932 --> 29:22.021
You called me
an "empathic soul,"

29:22.064 --> 29:23.892
and it is true.
My ganglia

29:23.936 --> 29:26.155
respond to shifts
in my environment,

29:26.199 --> 29:27.722
like an early-warning system.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.419
So it is... it is no coincidence

29:29.463 --> 29:33.206
that I started feeling sick
just before...

29:33.249 --> 29:35.164
the sphere engaged us.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.210
Why would...?I know what it is trying to say.

29:37.253 --> 29:39.778
Not first contact, Burnham.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.084
Lastcontact.

29:42.128 --> 29:45.218
I think it came to us to die.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.490
May?

29:56.533 --> 29:57.926
Still me.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.319
RENO:
Signal's piss-poor.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.581
We need to
amplify it.

30:00.624 --> 30:01.756
Cortical implant.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.411
What, you're talking
about trepanation?

30:04.454 --> 30:06.979
Drilling a hole in her skull?
Yeah.

30:07.022 --> 30:09.111
Are you gonna fix her up
with duct tape after?

30:09.155 --> 30:11.287
Maybe.
Commander?

30:11.331 --> 30:12.375
I think she's right.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.336
And I think you think that, too.

30:16.379 --> 30:18.512
Then we do this together.

30:18.555 --> 30:21.471
This is all I had
laying around.

30:21.515 --> 30:24.126
Please tell me
you have a laser scalpel.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.998
No. We're gonna do this
old-school.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.651
We need to sterilize
that drill bit.

30:27.695 --> 30:29.697
First aid kit's over there.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.532
I was able
to raise shields.

30:38.575 --> 30:39.881
We've gained some
ground, but we're still

30:39.925 --> 30:41.187
being held by
the stasis field.

30:41.230 --> 30:42.928
Power levels coming
and going, Captain.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.930
Security reports two dozen crew
still trapped below deck.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.714
Life support failing.

30:46.757 --> 30:49.369
I'm reading an energy buildup
from inside the sphere.

30:49.412 --> 30:51.850
Spiking 10,000 degrees
Kelvin and rising.

30:51.893 --> 30:52.981
Is it powering up weapons?

30:53.025 --> 30:54.853
Reading no
identifiable weapons,

30:54.896 --> 30:57.290
but its internal temperature
is now 20,000 degrees Kelvin.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.945
Divert all non-essential power
to weapons.

30:59.988 --> 31:01.860
Lock on that thing's
radial axis and prepare

31:01.903 --> 31:03.470
to fire photon torpedoes
on my order.

31:03.513 --> 31:04.950
Aye, sir. Arming torpedoes.

31:04.993 --> 31:06.995
SARU: Captain,
hold your fire.

31:07.039 --> 31:09.215
I do not believe
the sphere means us any harm.

31:09.258 --> 31:10.607
All evidence to the contrary.

31:10.651 --> 31:11.870
That thing's about
to destroy us.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.306
It's not destroying
us, Captain.

31:13.349 --> 31:15.003
It's trying to
send us a message.

31:15.047 --> 31:17.049
We received its message.
I'm about to send our reply.

31:17.092 --> 31:21.314
Captain, what if Vahar'ai,
my death process,

31:21.357 --> 31:24.491
was triggered because
the sphere is also dying?

31:27.363 --> 31:29.583
You want to run that
by me again?

31:29.626 --> 31:31.237
We Kelpiens have
a defining trait

31:31.280 --> 31:34.588
hard-wired into our DNA:
empathy.

31:34.631 --> 31:37.417
I can feel the sphere
reaching out,

31:37.460 --> 31:39.767
trying to share something
before it expires.

31:39.810 --> 31:42.813
Sir, I trust Saru's feelings
implicitly.

31:42.857 --> 31:45.468
That sphere didn't
come to attack us.SARU: Captain,

31:45.512 --> 31:47.818
I believe I have discerned
its means of communication.

31:47.862 --> 31:50.996
Detmer,
status on Spock's shuttle?

31:51.039 --> 31:53.868
Exits our sensor range
in six minutes.

31:53.912 --> 31:55.652
Once we lose his
warp signature,

31:55.696 --> 31:57.437
we won't be able
to reacquire it.Set an intercept course.

31:57.480 --> 31:59.047
I want us hauling ass
the second we break free.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.657
Aye, sir.

32:00.701 --> 32:01.832
Keep talking
and make it fast.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.573
What if the sphere

32:03.617 --> 32:06.315
was not attacking
our universal translator,

32:06.359 --> 32:09.318
but attempting
to teach us itslanguage

32:09.362 --> 32:11.407
because it wants
to be remembered,

32:11.451 --> 32:13.583
to preserve its history

32:13.627 --> 32:15.237
using Discovery,

32:15.281 --> 32:18.327
but it cannot unless
we power down and let it in?

32:18.371 --> 32:20.982
That thing snatched us out of
warp and almost gutted the ship.

32:21.026 --> 32:22.418
What if we lower shields,

32:22.462 --> 32:23.942
and that's exactly what it needs
to end us?

32:26.596 --> 32:29.773
Computer, adjust
viewscreen display

32:29.817 --> 32:32.602
to ultraviolet.

32:32.646 --> 32:34.865
That is the light pattern
I have been seeing

32:34.909 --> 32:36.998
everywhere,
repeating again

32:37.042 --> 32:40.784
and again, generated
by the sphere's virus.

32:40.828 --> 32:42.961
Computer, run the light pattern

32:43.004 --> 32:45.572
through the universal
translator.

32:45.615 --> 32:47.791
Captain, I believe
we are looking

32:47.835 --> 32:49.402
at a multitude
of languages

32:49.445 --> 32:52.753
so advanced,
and knowledge so vast

32:52.796 --> 32:55.190
that it simply
overloaded our system.

32:55.234 --> 32:57.627
This sphere is
100,000 years old.

32:57.671 --> 33:00.979
Imagine what it knows,
what it's seen.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.415
Captain, this falls
under Discovery's

33:02.458 --> 33:03.807
original mission
statement

33:03.851 --> 33:05.287
as a science vessel.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.868
STAMETS:
Well, I'll be.

33:20.911 --> 33:22.217
An amplified cortical implant.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.270
Hey, kiddo.

33:32.706 --> 33:34.664
What's your favorite song?

33:34.708 --> 33:36.579
What?

33:36.623 --> 33:39.539
Your favorite song--
sing it for me.

33:44.065 --> 33:48.330
♪ Though I'm past
one hundred thousand miles ♪

33:48.374 --> 33:52.682
BOTH:
♪ I'm feeling very still

33:52.726 --> 33:59.385
♪ And I think my spaceship knows
which way to go ♪

34:00.908 --> 34:04.085
♪ Tell my wife
I love her very much ♪

34:04.129 --> 34:06.783
♪ She knows.

34:27.152 --> 34:29.154
May?

34:31.764 --> 34:34.420
You wanted to talk to me?

34:34.463 --> 34:36.030
Here I am.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.772
What do you want?
Who are you?

34:38.815 --> 34:41.818
I'm from a species
known as the JahSepp.

34:41.862 --> 34:45.344
We lived harmoniously until an
alien intruder began to arrive

34:45.387 --> 34:48.042
at random intervals,

34:48.085 --> 34:50.827
ravaging our ecosystem
irreparably.

34:50.871 --> 34:53.525
So, you came for help
to rid your species

34:53.569 --> 34:55.397
of a destructive alien presence?

34:55.440 --> 34:57.530
Youare the destructive
alien presence.

34:57.573 --> 35:01.099
The-the... the jumps?

35:02.752 --> 35:04.711
Discovery'sjumps?

35:04.754 --> 35:08.062
I broke through the
confines of the network

35:08.106 --> 35:10.020
to reach you,
at great risk.

35:10.064 --> 35:11.761
Risk? You infected
my friend.

35:11.805 --> 35:14.112
You don't belong
inside of her.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.114
You fly the ship from within
the cube, I can reach you.

35:16.157 --> 35:18.942
In Tilly, I found the memory
of May Ahearn, someone I knew

35:18.986 --> 35:21.380
she'd be sympathetic to,
if given a second chance.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.643
Once she trusted May,
I planned to persuade her

35:23.686 --> 35:25.427
to deliver my
message to you.

35:25.471 --> 35:28.387
Oh, I can only ask
for your forgiveness.

35:28.430 --> 35:29.997
I knew better.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.825
I knowbetter.

35:31.868 --> 35:34.828
I'll do whatever it takes
to fix this.

35:34.871 --> 35:36.830
All I ask is
that you let Tilly go.

35:36.873 --> 35:38.005
I can't.

35:38.048 --> 35:39.789
I have other plans for her.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.185
Wrong!Oh. No!

35:46.666 --> 35:47.841
Tilly!

35:47.884 --> 35:49.321
The sphere's

35:49.364 --> 35:50.800
internal temperature
is approaching

35:50.844 --> 35:52.802
ten-to-the-sixth-power Kelvin
and rising.

35:52.846 --> 35:54.369
Our weapons will just
disintegrate in that heat.

35:54.413 --> 35:55.805
Solar temperatures.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.546
A sign of core collapse.

35:57.590 --> 36:00.201
Captain, if we are correct,

36:00.245 --> 36:03.204
once the transmission is
complete, the sphere can die

36:03.248 --> 36:05.815
knowing that it will live on
after it is gone.

36:05.859 --> 36:09.645
We can choose to fulfill
our part in its destiny,

36:09.689 --> 36:14.911
or simply let it fade away
unremembered.

36:14.955 --> 36:17.218
Spock's shuttle is almost
out of sensor range, sir.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.743
Prepare to lower shields.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.226
If this goes south,
overload the warp core

36:25.270 --> 36:27.402
and eject it at the sphere
on my command.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.622
Even at half the distance,
the blast will decimate it.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.972
When it lets go, we divert
all power to shields

36:32.015 --> 36:33.843
and try to ride the shock wave
to a safe distance.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.237
Assuming it doesn't
vaporize us first.

36:36.281 --> 36:37.804
If there's even half a
chance you're correct,

36:37.847 --> 36:40.589
I'm bound by my
oath and conscience

36:40.633 --> 36:42.765
not to let it
vanish forever.

36:42.809 --> 36:44.289
Commanders,
take your stations.

36:44.332 --> 36:47.161
I'll follow your lead.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.816
Lieutenant Detmer,
lower shields.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.383
Aye, sir. Shields down.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.305
SARU:
Bryce,

37:00.348 --> 37:02.350
all channels open.
Owosekun,

37:02.394 --> 37:05.005
divert all computing
resources to Communications.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.790
Yes, Commander.
Here goes nothing.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.717
Transmission is downloading.

37:21.761 --> 37:23.241
All library computers

37:23.284 --> 37:24.938
are processing
at 20% above maximum.

37:24.981 --> 37:27.114
Whatever the sphere is saying,
we're getting all of it.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.942
How long until it blows?Seconds. Power

37:28.985 --> 37:31.118
and energy levels
are off the chart.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.772
Detmer, can you put enough
distance between us in time?

37:32.815 --> 37:35.209
Negative, sir. We're still being
locked by the stasis field.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.342
Transmission complete.Detmer, eject the warp core.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.126
Computer controls
not responding, sir.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.127
Detonation confirmed.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.607
Hard astern. Full impulse now.

37:48.788 --> 37:51.138
SARU:
Ah.

37:51.181 --> 37:53.967
It is so beautiful.

37:54.010 --> 37:57.231
The light is almost like...
music.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.973
Yes, it is.

38:00.016 --> 38:03.019
I'm at a loss as to how
we're still alive to see it.

38:04.978 --> 38:07.285
The sphere's stasis field
reversed polarity

38:07.328 --> 38:10.157
a nanosecond
before detonation...

38:10.200 --> 38:13.334
and pushed us clear.

38:13.378 --> 38:16.206
Its final act was to save us

38:16.250 --> 38:18.513
so we could tell its story.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.347
Hand me the damn torch.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.666
Tilly.

38:40.709 --> 38:41.841
Breathe. Breathe, Tilly.

38:41.884 --> 38:42.929
Breathe.

38:42.972 --> 38:45.018
Breathe, breathe. Slow it down.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.715
Breathe. Come on, you're okay.

38:46.759 --> 38:49.501
You're still you.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.024
Tilly.

38:51.067 --> 38:54.027
Slow. Shh.

38:54.070 --> 38:56.029
Stamets to Burnham.
We got Tilly.

38:56.072 --> 38:57.987
She's okay.

39:13.829 --> 39:16.354
Now it is my turn.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.921
Take me to my quarters, please.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.613
I left home
with a handful of seeds.

40:00.659 --> 40:02.704
Is this from your homeworld?

40:02.748 --> 40:06.142
It is the blossom
that marks the...

40:06.186 --> 40:09.145
the passing of seasons
on Kaminar.

40:11.496 --> 40:15.238
Somewhere along the way,
I... I lost who I was.

40:15.282 --> 40:18.111
So focused on being

40:18.154 --> 40:21.375
the best Kelpien in Starfleet.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.683
Defined by my rank

40:24.726 --> 40:26.728
and uniform...

40:28.643 --> 40:30.993
...until that is all I became.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.826
You are wrong.

40:37.870 --> 40:39.828
Look at what
you've achieved.

40:39.872 --> 40:43.484
You found yourself
among the stars.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.226
You found your bravery.

40:46.269 --> 40:48.924
Your strength.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.579
You've saved so
many lives, Saru.

40:53.189 --> 40:55.714
Including mine.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.640
It is time.

41:12.992 --> 41:17.170
In that first drawer,
you will find a Kelpien knife,

41:17.213 --> 41:21.696
a keepsake I use
to prune my flowers.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.495
I need you

41:37.538 --> 41:41.194
to... to sever my ganglia

41:41.237 --> 41:43.152
and end my suffering.

41:43.196 --> 41:44.719
I need your help

41:44.763 --> 41:47.635
so that I can die now,

41:47.679 --> 41:50.377
peacefully,

41:50.420 --> 41:54.294
before the pain and madness
overtakes me.

42:02.868 --> 42:06.132
Thank you, Michael.

42:19.580 --> 42:22.583
Do we have to do this?

42:22.627 --> 42:26.369
Is it truly inevitable?

42:26.413 --> 42:29.677
I am sorry.

42:32.419 --> 42:35.944
I know how hard
this is for you.

42:35.988 --> 42:38.991
How many people
you've already lost.

42:42.995 --> 42:46.694
I would do it myself, but...

42:46.738 --> 42:49.479
I am too weak.

42:57.531 --> 42:59.533
After all this time...

43:01.404 --> 43:05.713
...after everything that we
have been through together...

43:07.715 --> 43:10.239
...I realize now

43:10.283 --> 43:13.895
that you are my family, Saru.

43:14.940 --> 43:18.857
I feel the same...

43:18.900 --> 43:20.859
about you.

43:20.902 --> 43:24.514
You are the only one
who knows me.

43:25.951 --> 43:28.910
You replaced the sister I had
on Kaminar.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.610
Siranna.

43:34.786 --> 43:37.745
That knife was hers.

43:38.746 --> 43:40.879
I left her

43:40.922 --> 43:44.360
without so much as a good-bye.

43:45.361 --> 43:48.626
You promise me--

43:48.669 --> 43:52.934
no matter how frightening
or painful it may be--

43:52.978 --> 43:55.720
promise me

43:55.763 --> 43:57.896
you will

43:57.939 --> 44:01.073
mend your relationship
with Spock.

44:01.116 --> 44:05.164
If you and I can build
this type of bond,

44:05.207 --> 44:07.383
I'm certain
you can do the same with him.

44:08.515 --> 44:10.691
Please.

44:11.736 --> 44:13.694
I promise.

44:18.264 --> 44:22.137
Good-bye, Michael.

44:25.924 --> 44:28.709
I love you, Saru.

44:36.891 --> 44:39.633
Michael? What is wrong?

44:39.677 --> 44:43.419
I-I bare... I barely touched it.

44:43.463 --> 44:45.944
They fell out
on their own.

44:54.256 --> 44:56.128
I... I, uh...

44:56.171 --> 44:58.217
don't understand.

44:58.260 --> 45:00.436
I should be...

45:03.178 --> 45:06.573
POLLARD: Your vital signs
have returned to normal.

45:06.616 --> 45:07.792
How are you feeling?

45:07.835 --> 45:11.186
I have never felt
this way before.

45:11.230 --> 45:15.060
Fear has always been the
governing principle of my life.

45:15.103 --> 45:17.802
But now...

45:17.845 --> 45:20.282
it is gone.

45:20.326 --> 45:23.155
More than that,
I feel...

45:24.199 --> 45:25.897
...power.

45:25.940 --> 45:29.814
My own power.

45:29.857 --> 45:31.554
Well,

45:31.598 --> 45:35.297
consider yourself certified
for duty, Commander.

45:39.084 --> 45:43.610
Despite speaking 94 languages,

45:43.653 --> 45:47.962
there are times when
words are not enough.

45:55.143 --> 45:56.797
Initial reports

45:56.841 --> 45:58.799
are coming in
from the science teams.

46:00.845 --> 46:04.022
The sphere didn't just give us
its language.

46:04.065 --> 46:07.329
We have recorded everything
it has seen and experienced

46:07.373 --> 46:09.723
the last 100,000 years.

46:09.767 --> 46:11.943
Its legacy.

46:11.986 --> 46:14.859
And your legacy
has a new chapter.

46:16.382 --> 46:19.994
A new and deeply troubling one.

46:22.867 --> 46:24.259
The Kelpien way of life

46:24.303 --> 46:27.480
has always been oriented
toward death

46:27.523 --> 46:29.656
and the role the
Ba'ul play in it.

46:29.699 --> 46:33.529
My people call it
"The Great Balance."

46:33.573 --> 46:37.490
It is our central,
organizing truth.

46:37.533 --> 46:38.970
But you proved it wrong.

46:39.013 --> 46:40.710
Precisely.

46:40.754 --> 46:44.279
And you asked me before
why I could not go home.

46:44.323 --> 46:48.718
It is because I made a promise
to Captain Georgiou

46:48.762 --> 46:51.852
to uphold General Order 1,

46:51.896 --> 46:55.813
not to interfere
with the destiny of my species.

46:55.856 --> 46:58.511
But now,

46:58.554 --> 47:02.994
knowing that what my people
have accepted as the truth

47:03.037 --> 47:06.040
is a lie?

47:08.390 --> 47:11.350
What does this mean for us?

47:11.393 --> 47:13.091
For my species?

47:13.134 --> 47:15.833
My... my planet?

47:21.926 --> 47:25.059
COMPUTER: The war between
the Quaternary star systems

47:25.103 --> 47:27.061
and the Roquar'ri Imperium
lasted a solar cent...

47:28.628 --> 47:30.586
From the sphere?

47:30.630 --> 47:32.850
The computer's translation.

47:32.893 --> 47:35.156
It's like we've found
our galaxy's Dead Sea Scrolls.

47:35.200 --> 47:38.029
Federation scientists will be
studying this for centuries

47:38.072 --> 47:40.683
thanks to you and Saru.

47:40.727 --> 47:43.295
I hope it was worth the cost.

47:44.339 --> 47:46.124
Cost us nothing, sir.

47:46.167 --> 47:48.387
I combed through the
sphere's sensor records

47:48.430 --> 47:50.606
and found the last
thing that it saw:

47:50.650 --> 47:51.912
Spock's shuttle.

47:51.956 --> 47:54.393
I was able to track it
beyond our sensor range.

47:55.437 --> 47:56.917
Conn,

47:56.961 --> 47:58.745
Commander Burnham
is sending you

47:58.788 --> 48:00.268
the coordinates
of Spock's shuttle.

48:00.312 --> 48:01.791
Plot a course,
and don't spare the horses.

48:01.835 --> 48:02.836
DETMER:
Aye, sir.

48:05.752 --> 48:09.016
From now on,

48:09.060 --> 48:12.411
I'll work to keep you clear

48:12.454 --> 48:14.239
about whatever happens
with your brother.

48:14.282 --> 48:17.068
Thank you, Captain, but I have
had a change of heart.

48:18.765 --> 48:20.549
I can't abandon him.

48:20.593 --> 48:22.508
No matter the mistakes
that I've made,

48:22.551 --> 48:25.598
I need my brother to know that
I will always be there for him.

48:25.641 --> 48:27.469
No matter what.

48:32.866 --> 48:34.868
We need to close the
door to the network.

48:34.912 --> 48:36.130
Forever.

48:36.174 --> 48:39.699
Just making
final calculations.

48:39.742 --> 48:42.920
MAY:
Hi, hi. Hello? Hello? It's me.

48:45.009 --> 48:46.227
Did you see that?

48:46.271 --> 48:47.881
See what?May.

48:47.925 --> 48:50.536
She was there,
and then she was gone.

48:50.579 --> 48:53.060
Um...

48:53.104 --> 48:56.716
...you might still be coming
down off your hallucinogen.

48:56.759 --> 48:57.935
No, I swear. I swear.RENO:
Yeah.

48:57.978 --> 49:00.024
No, it's natural to be paranoid

49:00.067 --> 49:01.895
in your condition.Something is not right.

49:01.939 --> 49:02.896
Something's not right.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.550
MAY:
Hello?

49:04.593 --> 49:05.768
Tilly. Hello?

49:05.812 --> 49:07.248
Tilly. Hello, hello...

49:08.815 --> 49:10.251
Wow.

49:10.295 --> 49:12.688
Have you always been
a superior being?

49:12.732 --> 49:14.603
MAY :
Hi. Hello? Hello?

49:14.647 --> 49:17.084
Because...

49:17.128 --> 49:18.956
the harmonics
in your aura...

49:18.999 --> 49:20.261
You know, I was thinking

49:20.305 --> 49:23.961
the exact same thing
about your aura.

49:24.004 --> 49:25.440
What's that dust on your face?

49:25.484 --> 49:26.789
...dust on your face?

49:26.833 --> 49:28.269
It's on yours, too.

49:28.313 --> 49:29.096
STAMETS :
...yours, too.

49:29.140 --> 49:30.619
That tastes like...

49:30.663 --> 49:31.881
RENO:
Psilocybin?

49:31.925 --> 49:33.187
STAMETS:
Psilocybin?

49:33.231 --> 49:35.276
It dosed us. It dosed us.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.669
Slap me really hard.

49:38.671 --> 49:40.281
Why'd I do that?

49:40.325 --> 49:42.501
To get me focused enough
to find the med kit.

49:42.544 --> 49:44.982
I need to hit us both
with a shot of impedrizine

49:45.025 --> 49:46.157
so we can come down.

49:48.942 --> 49:51.553
Now I need to
give one to Tilly.

49:51.597 --> 49:53.077
Wait a minute. Where is she?

49:54.252 --> 49:55.383
Tilly?

49:56.428 --> 49:57.951
Wait.

49:59.170 --> 50:00.649
Oh, my God,
they took her.

50:00.693 --> 50:02.173
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

50:04.610 --> 50:07.395
Tilly?

50:07.439 --> 50:09.136
No!
