I am sorry.

08:53.034 --> 08:55.369
Thank you, Jamila.
I need you more.

We will get rid
ourselves. Good night.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.916

Good evening sir.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.375
Good evening.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.148
- That would be nice if you keep checking
a little bit, darling.

09:24.315 --> 09:25.358
- What?

09:26.567 --> 09:27.735
- Hum?

09:27.902 --> 09:29.528
- Mom, please.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.781
- I have reason to say that?

09:31.948 --> 09:33.115
- No.

09:33.741 --> 09:34.909
- Sorry?

09:37.870 --> 09:41.082
- No, I do not think you have
reasons to tell me that.

09:41.249 --> 09:43.584
What are you looking for,
at the end?

09:43.751 --> 09:45.586
- I would appreciate,

09:45.753 --> 09:49.674
if you could continue
these squabbles after dinner.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.467
Would that be possible?

09:51.884 --> 09:53.052
- Yes.

09:57.807 --> 10:01.477
These are not bickering,
I'm worried.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.313
I'm sorry
to be alive like that.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.360
Excuse me. You know why
I tell you that.

10:09.527 --> 10:11.362
- Yes. I know, mom.

10:13.281 --> 10:15.658
- This morning I ...
I entered

10:15.866 --> 10:19.036
in Paul's room.
He was already awake.

10:19.203 --> 10:24.625
He looked at me with an air
all cheered and he said, "Dad."

10:24.792 --> 10:26.294
Is not it adorable?

10:26.460 --> 10:30.381
This is his second word.
Thomas will be delighted.

10:30.589 --> 10:33.676
- It has been forever.
We went to Kenya.

10:33.843 --> 10:36.929
It must be 5 or 6 years old.
Why?

10:37.096 --> 10:41.309
- You had taken medication
preventive measures against malaria?

10:41.475 --> 10:43.894
- I do not remember. Why?

10:44.061 --> 10:47.523
- The analyzes showed that in addition
overdose of antidepressants,

10:47.690 --> 10:51.485
there is poisoning
by a drug of this kind.

10:51.652 --> 10:54.405
It's not delivered
only on prescription.

10:54.572 --> 10:58.034
You know if they had any
still at home?

10:58.200 --> 11:02.788
- 'Eve, you do not know if mom has
what kind of drugs' at home?

11:02.955 --> 11:04.415
- I dunno.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.028
I am ready.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.406
In English

13:00.573 --> 13:03.617
- They will not give their approval
without condition.

13:05.244 --> 13:06.412
Of course.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.083
He must escape unscathed.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.752
Sadly,
it is not the first time.

13:14.837 --> 13:15.963
Yes.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.176
I know.
We'll talk about it when you're there.

13:23.471 --> 13:24.472
When?

13:27.475 --> 13:29.935
You think
what will I keep for so long?

13:34.106 --> 13:35.191
Me too.

13:39.195 --> 13:41.489
A committee is a committee.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.450
And a credit committee,
it's a credit committee.

13:51.457 --> 13:52.458
Yes.

13:53.459 --> 13:56.212
If it were up to me,
it would be done tomorrow.

13:57.546 --> 13:58.547
Yes.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.842
I love you too.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.348
Sleep well.

14:07.932 --> 14:09.141
I'll call you.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.521
Keep me informed, okay?

14:16.732 --> 14:17.983
Good night.

a little with us?

16:24.902 --> 16:26.362
- No thanks.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.993

Put your stuff on it

17:02.856 --> 17:04.233
Move in.

17:10.571 --> 17:13.951
I am sorry. It's improvised.
But we will get there.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.202
- It's OK, dad.

17:15.411 --> 17:18.997
- Good. So ... I'll go there.

17:19.164 --> 17:20.665
Are you trying to sleep?

17:20.833 --> 17:23.167
If you need us,
we are next to each other.

17:23.335 --> 17:24.545
- Yes.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.964

- Hello, Rachid.

19:16.281 --> 19:17.658
- Hello Madam.

19:17.825 --> 19:19.326
- You have not noticed?

19:19.535 --> 19:21.912
We had a visit,
last night.

19:22.079 --> 19:25.624
My brother's daughter, his first
marriage, will come live here.

19:25.874 --> 19:30.170
It would be nice if Jamila help
Ana's to arrange the yellow room.

19:30.337 --> 19:33.423
- I will tell him,
as soon as I get home.

19:33.632 --> 19:34.633
- Thank you.

19:36.134 --> 19:39.346
Make sure the dog
get to know the girl.

19:39.513 --> 19:40.973
He does not know her.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.267
- It will be done, Madam.
- Thank you.

19:44.142 --> 19:47.312
Sorry, I wanted to warn Rachid
for the little one.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.690
No idea.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.108
We'll see.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.777
Yes, it's awful.

19:53.944 --> 19:55.445
What more can be said?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.365
I hope she will recover quickly.

19:58.532 --> 19:59.867
Thomas is rather pessimistic.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.744
He inquired
on what she took.

20:03.871 --> 20:05.956
Yes, let's change the subject.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.709
I had Me Barin
who advises us to try ...

20:08.876 --> 20:11.044
Someone's knocking at the door.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.676
- Come in.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.562
- Hello sir.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.190
- Hello, Rachid.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.294
Thank you.
- How's it going sir?

20:52.461 --> 20:54.421
- It must go.

20:57.466 --> 20:58.592
Thank you.

21:04.681 --> 21:08.268
- Are you aware, sir?
- What?

21:08.477 --> 21:11.855
- Here, we store the material,
it is not a place of work.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.733
- Why did they come up?
- To take something.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.986
- How many were they?
- Four, unless I'm mistaken.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.948
- It's a workplace.
- It's a deposit.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.326
It happens only in a depot
we come to help ourselves.

21:24.493 --> 21:26.453
- Why are there toilets?

21:26.620 --> 21:29.831
- You will not believe me:
they too are in deposit.

21:29.998 --> 21:33.001
- Stop, Pierre.
What are these questions?

21:33.168 --> 21:37.172
Even when a deposit is closed,
we come to work there.

21:37.339 --> 21:40.300
- That's why
that they are secure. Especially here.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.219
- The gate was closed.

21:42.386 --> 21:44.930
They opened it
to take equipment.

21:45.097 --> 21:47.766
We could not predict
a landslide

21:47.933 --> 21:51.603
nor that this idiot would use
the toilets stored.

21:51.770 --> 21:53.146
- How to know?

21:53.313 --> 21:56.733
- It's a deposit.
Any idiot knows that.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.487
- Pierre, please.
Mr. Van Thamen. Excuse us.

22:00.654 --> 22:03.323
My son is very affected
by this incident.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.826
It's a contest
circumstances.

22:05.993 --> 22:08.286
- Of course Madam. Of course.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.415
A landslide like this

22:11.581 --> 22:14.835
it just does not happen
because a guy is going to pee.

22:15.002 --> 22:18.880
There was no tremor
earthen. There must be a reason.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.216
- That's exactly what we check.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.845
The deposit was cleared
to check the tie rods.

22:25.012 --> 22:28.390
You want to insinuate
that we have committed negligence?

22:28.557 --> 22:30.934
- I'm insisting nothing.
I do my job.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.729
We'll have to check everything
before resuming.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.522
- That's what we do.

22:35.689 --> 22:39.651
- Still happy that others
have stayed near the truck.

22:40.193 --> 22:41.820
And how's your guy?

22:41.987 --> 22:45.615
- He is conscious.
We will know more this afternoon.

22:45.782 --> 22:49.953
We are really sorry,
I can not tell you anything else.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.955
- Yes, it's terrible.

22:53.665 --> 22:57.210
- You can be sure that everything
is done in the rules here.

22:57.377 --> 23:00.922
- Of course. I imagine.
We are waiting for the final report.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.257
- Of course.

23:02.424 --> 23:06.970
- In the meantime, you leave more
no one enter this field.

23:14.686 --> 23:15.687
- What?

23:15.854 --> 23:17.856
- Your behaviour.

23:24.905 --> 23:26.782
- 'Eve,' Eve!

23:49.221 --> 23:50.972
It was on my way.

23:51.181 --> 23:55.143
I thought it would be nice
I'll come get you.

23:55.310 --> 23:58.188
- I thought you were
'to the hospital.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.065
- Until 4 pm

24:06.655 --> 24:08.115
Do you find that embarrassing?

24:08.281 --> 24:09.407
- No no.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.038
Turn signal

24:17.791 --> 24:19.042
- How was it?

24:19.251 --> 24:20.585
Not too hard?

24:20.752 --> 24:23.046
How are others?

24:23.213 --> 24:24.506
- I dunno.

24:24.714 --> 24:27.634
I can not say. Pretty nice.

24:27.801 --> 24:29.094
- Excuse me.

24:31.888 --> 24:32.764
Eve sniffs.

24:49.197 --> 24:50.949
Eve cries.

24:54.286 --> 24:56.163
'Eve...
Horn stroke

24:59.040 --> 25:00.500
'Eve, sweetie.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.181
Horn stroke

25:14.347 --> 25:15.849
Eve cries.

25:22.189 --> 25:24.733
Horn stroke

25:24.900 --> 25:26.359
Eve cries.

25:29.529 --> 25:31.198
I am sorry.

25:31.948 --> 25:35.952
- No, but it's already past.
It's OK. Excuse me.

25:36.912 --> 25:39.247
- I'd like to help you so much.

25:39.414 --> 25:40.582
- It's OK.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.501
- Really?

25:50.133 --> 25:52.844
I'm more used to
to have a daughter.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.513
I am terribly awkward.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.391
Forgive me.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.663
- Let's go, have it?

26:58.326 --> 26:59.619
- How old are you?

27:02.330 --> 27:03.581
- 13 years.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.544
- I thought you were younger.
- She will have

27:07.752 --> 27:10.338
13 years in ... 2 months.
That's it?

27:10.505 --> 27:11.464
- Yes.

27:12.924 --> 27:14.467
- Why are you asking that?

27:15.385 --> 27:17.345
- I'm interested.

27:19.264 --> 27:20.849
Have you been here before?

27:21.599 --> 27:23.935
- Here in Calais?
- Yes.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.479
- We came here together,

27:26.688 --> 27:28.023
when I was in Arles.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.525
You were 3 years old.
Do not you remember?

27:30.734 --> 27:31.985
- No.

27:39.284 --> 27:40.910
- Strange.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.163
- What is strange?

27:43.330 --> 27:45.582
- That she is at present.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.292
- Dad.

27:49.002 --> 27:50.879
- Are you going to stay here?

27:51.504 --> 27:52.630
- Dad.

27:54.382 --> 27:57.177
His mother is in the hospital.
I already told you.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.221
She has severe intoxication.
She stays here

28:00.430 --> 28:02.557
until
that she is recovering.

28:03.892 --> 28:07.103
- Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I know.

28:07.270 --> 28:10.690
So you will not stay here.

28:13.151 --> 28:14.986
I'm fine, I understood

28:15.195 --> 28:16.529
now.

28:21.159 --> 28:23.370
Still,
welcome to the club.

28:29.959 --> 28:32.253
Keys on the computer keyboard

29:47.787 --> 29:49.914
A door slams.

29:56.045 --> 29:58.381
Not with a cane

30:33.041 --> 30:34.667
Door opening

30:45.136 --> 30:46.930
slam

30:53.353 --> 30:55.396
The car starts.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.346
- Go ahead. It is important.

31:28.513 --> 31:31.307
Otherwise they will
to annoy us even more.

31:31.474 --> 31:33.935
We do not have good cards.

31:34.102 --> 31:38.189
You put us in trouble,
so take care of it.

31:38.606 --> 31:41.943
I spoke to Mr. Barin.
You can not count on it.

31:43.194 --> 31:45.071
I spoke with insurance.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.990
Someone knocked.
Yes?

31:47.240 --> 31:48.950
What's the matter?

31:49.117 --> 31:51.661
- Excuse me.
Monsieur Georges is not there.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.121
- What do you mean?

31:53.288 --> 31:55.540
- I went to his room,

31:55.748 --> 31:59.002
he was'nt here.
- He may be in the garden.

31:59.168 --> 32:02.547
- I searched everywhere.
He is nowhere.

32:02.714 --> 32:05.425
- Excuse me,
I'll call you right back.

32:05.592 --> 32:08.261
He could not evaporate.
Did you go to Thomas?

32:09.387 --> 32:12.265
- Mr. Thomas is gone
very early in Lille.

32:12.432 --> 32:15.935
Mrs Ana's sleeping
and Mademoiselle 'Eve too.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.479
- You really have
look at them?

32:18.688 --> 32:20.231
- Of course Madam.

32:21.524 --> 32:22.984
- Good wait.

32:26.821 --> 32:28.323
He is not at home?

32:32.410 --> 32:36.623
Yes. It's Anne Laurent.
Can I talk to my brother?

32:37.248 --> 32:39.292
When will it be over?

32:41.210 --> 32:44.839
That he reminds me. It's urgent.
Yes. Thank you.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.635
You checked
if his cane is up?

32:48.843 --> 32:50.386
- Look at this cup.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.889
This is just the beginning.
It dates from 2011.

32:53.097 --> 32:56.809
Look at this child who
has a distant look towards the infinite.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.854
"And beyond."
Thinking of his future.

33:00.063 --> 33:01.397
I have an asshole.

33:01.606 --> 33:05.360
"Reality"
(Richard Sanderson)

33:05.568 --> 33:07.153
What's this kikou?

33:07.320 --> 33:10.907
Look at this ridge.
It looks like a rooster. The old joke.

33:11.115 --> 33:13.159
Song of the cock

33:13.368 --> 33:17.121
Look at that head.
It's freaking out. Warning.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.582
Triumphant music

33:19.791 --> 33:21.125
Oh yo.

33:21.334 --> 33:23.836
Look at this figure
of hip hop.

33:24.003 --> 33:25.922
I dunno
if it's hip hop.

33:26.089 --> 33:28.633
It was the only figure
that I knew how to do.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.301
It's always the only one.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.387
I thought I was doing
a sick thing.

33:33.721 --> 33:35.973
The baby cries.

34:07.755 --> 34:09.716
Flush

34:11.759 --> 34:13.678
Crying baby

34:20.643 --> 34:23.271
- Excuse me, I was in the bathroom.

34:23.438 --> 34:25.648
Why are you still up?

34:25.815 --> 34:27.065
- I was waiting.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.368
Dad called?

34:40.496 --> 34:44.500
- They are already in Calais.
They should not be late.

34:46.210 --> 34:47.420
- So what?

34:49.255 --> 34:52.175
- Apparently,
it's less serious than we thought.

34:52.341 --> 34:53.842
- That is to say?

34:54.010 --> 34:55.887
- Thomas did not lie down.

34:56.053 --> 34:57.388
Door

34:59.015 --> 35:00.808
I think it's him.

35:01.601 --> 35:02.810
- Ana's?

35:06.189 --> 35:07.982
Hello Darling.

35:08.775 --> 35:10.276
Hello.
- Hello.

35:15.072 --> 35:16.073
- So what?

35:16.240 --> 35:19.243
- It's not so bad.
But he could have stayed there.

35:19.410 --> 35:23.748
Excuse me, I have to eat,
I have not eaten anything since this morning.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.547
He hit a tree
full force.

35:31.714 --> 35:33.591
The police think
that it is voluntary.

35:33.758 --> 35:36.427
There are no brake marks.

35:36.594 --> 35:37.970
- Do you believe them?

35:39.138 --> 35:40.389
- I dunno.

35:40.556 --> 35:43.434
Anne thinks
that it is voluntary too.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.019
- But why?

35:46.354 --> 35:48.439
- You remember his adventure
in Switzerland, in December?

35:51.818 --> 35:55.863
- What does he have as wounds?
You spoke to him?

35:56.030 --> 35:57.532
- No no.

35:57.698 --> 35:59.700
His ankle is broken.

36:00.618 --> 36:04.497
Fractures of the tibia and fibula.
The shoulder is a contusion.

36:04.664 --> 36:07.291
He has 2 broken ribs
and it's painful.

36:07.458 --> 36:09.710
He is under analgesic.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.255
With this story ...

36:13.464 --> 36:16.092
Anne is in all its forms.

36:16.259 --> 36:18.511
- I'm going down to see her?
- No no.

36:18.678 --> 36:21.097
She said
that she was going to bed.

36:21.264 --> 36:24.016
I am going to do the same thing.
I leave early.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.477
- Where is he? At your home?

36:26.644 --> 36:27.687
- To emergencies.

36:27.854 --> 36:30.773
The accident took place
very close to Lille.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.316
How are you, my dear?

36:32.483 --> 36:35.528
Not too disturbing for you?
- No. It's okay.

36:35.695 --> 36:37.280
I'm sorry.

36:38.614 --> 36:40.408
- Do not worry.

36:40.575 --> 36:44.287
It must be heavy to have
your mother, and then that.

36:44.996 --> 36:47.456
We are going to sleep?
Tomorrow you get up early.

36:47.623 --> 36:49.917
- Go ahead, I'll join you.

36:50.084 --> 36:52.753
- Good night.
- Good night Daddy.

37:46.849 --> 37:49.268
Keys on the computer keyboard

41:58.976 --> 42:00.603
Shout

42:04.106 --> 42:05.774
barking

42:50.069 --> 42:51.737
Punch

42:53.364 --> 42:54.907
Cry of pain

43:08.170 --> 43:11.131
- You come back here,
I break your head.

43:16.971 --> 43:18.639
Go away!

43:37.074 --> 43:39.785
shouting

43:58.846 --> 44:01.307
- It's not right?
Can I help you?

44:01.473 --> 44:03.434
- Okay okay.
- Are you sure?

44:03.600 --> 44:05.853
- It's nothing. Thank you very much.

44:11.275 --> 44:13.610
Pouet Pouet du rattle

44:54.985 --> 44:57.905
- He took his jacket,
and he left.

44:58.072 --> 44:59.656
- She defended herself?

44:59.823 --> 45:02.826
- She told Mr. Hougron,
he summoned the parents.

45:02.993 --> 45:04.370
- Oh, well.

45:11.126 --> 45:12.461
So what?

45:12.836 --> 45:14.922
- They were really annoying.

45:15.089 --> 45:19.510
He brought back the jacket,
but it's really cool, I think.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.055
- It's not laughing where you are.

45:23.222 --> 45:24.264
- Yeah.

45:26.517 --> 45:29.186
- Give me an iced tea,
please.

45:33.023 --> 45:37.069
- What do you want?
- I dunno. An ice cream.

45:37.236 --> 45:40.197
Phone ring

45:42.866 --> 45:44.993
- Hello? A moment, a moment.

45:46.662 --> 45:50.165
It's the hospital. They can
to do nothing without me.

45:50.332 --> 45:53.001
Here, take what you want.
Take ...

45:53.168 --> 45:57.881
a lemon ice cream for Ana's,
if there is, and then the Evian.

46:01.218 --> 46:03.762
- Thank you.
- 4 euros, please.

46:04.596 --> 46:07.015
Here to do 5.
Thank you. Goodbye.

46:07.182 --> 46:08.767
Hello.
- Hello.

46:08.976 --> 46:10.727
A palot with lemon,

46:10.894 --> 46:13.605
an orange ice cream,
please.

46:15.524 --> 46:17.234
And a bottle of Evian.

46:17.401 --> 46:19.945
- I have more Evian. Badoit?
- Yes.

46:23.907 --> 46:27.536
- Here. 3.70, please.

46:31.248 --> 46:32.583
Thank you.

46:34.835 --> 46:37.254
So ... To make 4
and to do 5.

46:37.421 --> 46:39.089
Thank you miss.
- Thank you.

46:39.256 --> 46:40.299
- Hello.
- Hello.

46:40.466 --> 46:42.885
We will take a Magnum.
And a Cornetto?

46:43.051 --> 46:43.927
- That's it.

46:44.094 --> 46:45.596
- Cornetto and Magnum?

46:47.848 --> 46:48.724
Goodbye.

46:48.891 --> 46:51.018
Here you are.
5 euros, please.

46:51.185 --> 46:52.478
Thank you.

46:55.689 --> 46:57.983
Inaudible conversation

47:14.750 --> 47:15.751
- Sweetheart.

47:18.504 --> 47:19.546
Sorry.

47:19.713 --> 47:21.006
Did you find everything?

47:21.173 --> 47:24.551
- Yes. There was more Evian,
so I took Badoit.

47:24.718 --> 47:25.969
- Perfect.

47:29.932 --> 47:31.141
- Dad.

47:32.809 --> 47:34.520
Do you like Ana's?

47:35.938 --> 47:39.233
- Of course I like Ana's.
It's my wife.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.902
- Mom too, it was your wife.

47:42.069 --> 47:43.529
- That is true...

47:45.405 --> 47:46.782
You're early, you.

47:59.127 --> 48:02.756
Why do you ask me this?
Of course I love Ana's.

48:03.090 --> 48:05.467
- To know.
- And why?

48:05.634 --> 48:06.969
- Like this.

48:14.518 --> 48:16.895
- You know how
did I meet Ana's?

48:17.062 --> 48:18.105
- No.

48:45.549 --> 48:47.217
It rings the doorbell.

49:02.691 --> 49:05.736
It sounds insistently.

49:12.576 --> 49:14.536
Mobile ringtone

49:14.703 --> 49:16.371
He sighs.

49:17.998 --> 49:20.626
Mobile ringtone

49:30.719 --> 49:32.095
- Oh...

49:34.222 --> 49:35.474
He blows.

49:41.521 --> 49:44.358
Mobile ringtone

49:59.623 --> 50:00.749
- Yes?

50:05.796 --> 50:06.630
No.

50:11.385 --> 50:12.386
No.

50:16.390 --> 50:18.392
You're right. If you want.

50:20.143 --> 50:21.561
But stop...

51:19.119 --> 51:20.370
- Well then...

51:23.540 --> 51:25.625
I do not know what to say.

51:25.792 --> 51:27.377
- So, say nothing.

51:36.178 --> 51:39.222
- All the same, you can not
disappear like that.

51:39.389 --> 51:40.557
- Oh no?

52:03.580 --> 52:05.165
- Make yourself see.

52:09.169 --> 52:11.296
It only happens to you.

52:11.463 --> 52:13.465
- Thank you from the heart.

52:13.632 --> 52:18.136
- No one could know
that this madman would hang around there.

52:18.303 --> 52:20.013
- Mom, please ...

52:22.390 --> 52:26.478
- But why do you shoot yourself,
instead of going to the police?

52:26.645 --> 52:30.649
It could have served us,
if you want an arrangement.

52:31.942 --> 52:34.945
And why do you disappear
the site?

52:35.111 --> 52:37.906
You're ashamed because
Do you have a coquard?

52:38.073 --> 52:40.867
You can not leave everything
in plan like that.

52:41.034 --> 52:43.078
- Well, yes, as you see.

52:50.168 --> 52:53.672
- How do you see the rest,
If I may?

52:54.714 --> 52:57.008
You have a lot of credit.

52:57.175 --> 52:59.970
You're my son
and you are the future boss.

53:00.887 --> 53:04.057
But all that is not
engraved in marble.

53:04.224 --> 53:06.226
So give yourself a little trouble.

53:06.393 --> 53:08.645
Your accident story,

53:08.812 --> 53:11.439
it does not help me
to save the business.

53:11.606 --> 53:13.608
It's clear to you. No?

53:13.775 --> 53:17.237
- Can you stop a little, Mom?
Pity.

53:30.292 --> 53:31.960
- What is happening?

53:32.419 --> 53:34.421
He sighs.

53:37.132 --> 53:40.093
Since when do you drink?
I did not even notice.

53:40.260 --> 53:42.012
- I dont drink.

53:48.560 --> 53:52.188
- What do I have to do?
I can not help you?

53:52.355 --> 53:55.609
Do you have any anxieties?
Do you need a doctor?

53:55.775 --> 53:58.862
Since you left,
I do not know what you do.

53:59.029 --> 54:02.282
You have a girlfriend?
Are you unhappy in love?

54:02.449 --> 54:03.783
Talk to me.

54:12.584 --> 54:15.670
what do you do in the evening
after work?

54:20.967 --> 54:22.844
You do not talk to me anymore?

54:23.637 --> 54:25.221
- I'm going to bed.

54:27.557 --> 54:29.142
- You are going to bed?

54:29.309 --> 54:31.686
- What can I
to do something else?

54:31.853 --> 54:33.104
What are you doing?

54:33.271 --> 54:35.315
- Well ... I work.

55:03.218 --> 55:04.803
Stone urine.

55:22.946 --> 55:25.198
Flush

55:29.244 --> 55:31.955
Pierrot ... Let me help you.

55:32.122 --> 55:33.456
Honey...

55:35.291 --> 55:37.002
My love. Hmm?

55:38.128 --> 55:39.379
- Mom.

55:41.840 --> 55:43.508
He groans.

55:58.398 --> 55:59.983
I'm worth nothing.

56:00.650 --> 56:01.735
- What?

56:03.153 --> 56:04.696
- I'm worth nothing.

56:05.238 --> 56:07.615
- What are these nonsense?

56:07.782 --> 56:09.617
- You think it yourself.

56:10.076 --> 56:11.369
Stop this number.

56:11.536 --> 56:14.956
I will never repeat
this shit box.

56:15.123 --> 56:18.126
- And what
you want to do something else?

56:18.293 --> 56:22.338
- Nothing. Why should
that I do something?

56:23.256 --> 56:26.551
- Stopped. You behave
as a vexed kid,

56:26.718 --> 56:29.554
just because you caught yourself
a punch.

56:29.721 --> 56:32.599
- I recognize
my dear little mother.

56:32.766 --> 56:36.811
Why do not you go home
to get back to work?

56:39.856 --> 56:41.858
- We can not do anything for you.

56:42.567 --> 56:44.235
- You said it, mom.

56:44.944 --> 56:47.989
barking

57:29.197 --> 57:31.699
He sings <i> Chandelier </i> of Sia.

59:33.279 --> 59:34.906
- Hello. Thomas Laurent.

59:35.073 --> 59:37.533
My ex-wife, Nathalie Laurent,
has been admitted here.

59:37.700 --> 59:39.035
We would like to see it.

59:39.202 --> 59:41.371
- It's not time for visits.
- I called.

59:41.537 --> 59:44.249
I am in the service
of Lille surgery.

59:44.415 --> 59:46.542
My daughter did not see her mother.

59:46.709 --> 59:48.127
- 'To whom did you speak?

59:48.294 --> 59:50.838
- 'To a doctor ... I do not
remember more of his name.

59:51.005 --> 59:52.840
You will find.

59:53.633 --> 59:56.719
- Florence at the reception.
There is a gentleman ...

59:56.886 --> 59:57.804
- Laurent ... Dr. Lawrence.

59:57.971 --> 01:00:00.848
- Dr. Laurent. He wants to see
the patient who has just arrived.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:04.894
He spoke to a doctor
for permission to visit.

01:00:05.061 --> 01:00:06.312
- We're going.
- No no.

01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:09.565
- He's with the girl
of the patient. Yes.

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:12.026
Okay. Goodbye.

01:00:12.193 --> 01:00:14.445
You can come in.
- Thank you.

01:00:16.698 --> 01:00:19.951
- Room 223. Second floor.
- Thank you very much.

01:00:52.984 --> 01:00:54.235
Come on come.

01:01:05.288 --> 01:01:08.666
Hello. I look for
room 223, please.

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:11.002
- At the end of the corridor on the right.
- Thank you.

01:01:11.169 --> 01:01:12.628
- You're welcome.

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.184
He's knocking on the door.

01:02:38.548 --> 01:02:40.758
Traffic

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:11.140
Choked conversation
by traffic

01:05:52.867 --> 01:05:55.119
- The bathroom on the left.

01:06:03.836 --> 01:06:05.838
A guest room, the.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.602
- It's facing south, right?
- Yes.

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:23.439
I go first.

01:06:32.031 --> 01:06:34.158
Can you wait a second?

01:06:34.325 --> 01:06:35.826
The room of my daughter, 'Eve.

01:06:35.993 --> 01:06:38.245
- Hello, 'Eve.
- Hello Madam.

01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:42.541
- It's a pretty room.
- Yes.

01:06:44.502 --> 01:06:46.170
- Very bright.

01:06:47.338 --> 01:06:49.840
Did you feel good?
- Yes.

01:06:50.633 --> 01:06:52.927
- Are you sad to have to leave?

01:06:53.094 --> 01:06:54.095
- Yes.

01:06:55.596 --> 01:06:57.556
- How old are you?
- 13 years.

01:06:57.723 --> 01:06:59.642
- So you'll go to 4th,
that's it?

01:06:59.809 --> 01:07:04.313
- Since the death of his mother,
she lives with me in Calais.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.856
We continue?

01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:07.233
- Yes...

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.111
Goodbye, Eve.
Nice to meet you.

01:07:10.277 --> 01:07:11.654
- Bye Madam.

01:07:16.659 --> 01:07:18.452
- I still go ahead.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.746
The bedroom.

01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:25.292
Toilet.

01:07:26.043 --> 01:07:28.170
And here it was my office.

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:37.888
We can go back down
by this staircase.

01:07:38.055 --> 01:07:42.309
In fact, it's two houses together,
hence the two stairs.

01:07:42.476 --> 01:07:43.811
- Do you have plans?

01:07:43.978 --> 01:07:47.398
Interested persons
always want to see them.

01:07:47.565 --> 01:07:51.402
- I do not live here anymore.
I think a friend has them.

01:07:51.569 --> 01:07:53.362
- How many m2?
- About 200.

01:07:55.906 --> 01:07:59.118
- You can go, Rachid.
I need you more.

01:07:59.326 --> 01:08:00.995
- As you wish, sir.

01:08:01.162 --> 01:08:03.205
If you need me,
Ring.

01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:04.623
- Of course.

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:09.462
Now he is upset.

01:08:10.504 --> 01:08:14.967
He does not support anyone
else is holding my hand on me.

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.886
- I barely touch you, sir.

01:08:28.063 --> 01:08:29.564
- How are you?

01:08:29.732 --> 01:08:32.859
- Oh, we're trying to do
his job huh.

01:08:33.444 --> 01:08:35.029
- Your job"?

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:38.698
And that consists
What is your "job"?

01:08:38.866 --> 01:08:42.036
- You know it well.
I cut your hair.

01:08:42.203 --> 01:08:44.246
I cut the hair
many people.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:46.582
Those of Mr. Delamare,

01:08:46.749 --> 01:08:48.501
of Monsieur Franck.

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:51.127
I cut the hair ...
- You're basing me.

01:08:51.295 --> 01:08:53.589
- Yes, sir ... Excuse me.

01:08:59.386 --> 01:09:02.014
How much do you make per month?

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.475
- We do not ask this kind
of questions.

01:09:04.642 --> 01:09:06.852
- You do not need money?

01:09:07.019 --> 01:09:09.979
- Everyone needs it.
- Exactly.

01:09:13.776 --> 01:09:14.693
So?

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:17.029
- I do not understand you,
Sir.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.618
- How long has it been
you come here?

01:09:22.785 --> 01:09:24.453
- Oh. More than 10 years.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:28.082
- Almost 20.
You should learn to count.

01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:30.667
I may be spoiled,
but that, I know it.

01:09:30.835 --> 01:09:33.087
- I'm not that old.

01:09:33.254 --> 01:09:34.505
He's laughing.

01:09:44.223 --> 01:09:47.725
- You can do me a favor.
- Yes.

01:09:48.227 --> 01:09:50.145
- I'll pay you well.

01:09:50.312 --> 01:09:51.272
- Yes.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.694
- Stop this circus.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.531
Excuse me.

01:10:05.536 --> 01:10:07.454
I'm stuck here.

01:10:08.122 --> 01:10:13.043
I have sunk in a tree
and I was too stupid to do that well.

01:10:13.752 --> 01:10:16.630
- Sir, I was told
that it was an accident.

01:10:16.797 --> 01:10:18.883
- That's kind of bad, that.

01:10:20.843 --> 01:10:23.262
My son is a fool.

01:10:23.429 --> 01:10:26.891
He is a doctor.
For him, it would be a trifle,

01:10:27.057 --> 01:10:28.893
but he is limited.

01:10:30.519 --> 01:10:34.565
Last year, I went
in Zurich. They refused me.

01:10:34.732 --> 01:10:37.693
I am too healthy,
it seems.

01:10:40.154 --> 01:10:43.782
Now I am a prisoner
that fucking chair.

01:10:43.949 --> 01:10:45.534
You understand?

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:50.414
I can not even escape.

01:10:53.626 --> 01:10:58.130
If you get me a gun
and ammunition,

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.967
you will not regret it.

01:11:02.468 --> 01:11:04.136
- But Sir...

01:11:05.137 --> 01:11:08.682
- A rifle or drugs
in sufficient quantity

01:11:08.849 --> 01:11:11.352
would also do the trick.

01:11:13.145 --> 01:11:16.899
I have money here.
I can make you rich.

01:11:19.026 --> 01:11:22.655
Rich enough to have no more
need to cut hair

01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:24.782
to old fools.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.370
So?

01:11:30.162 --> 01:11:33.082
- Sir,
I do not know what to say.

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:35.834
How can I
to get that?

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.628
I would be
immediately suspects.

01:11:37.795 --> 01:11:39.588
- For God Sake.
- Why do that?

01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:42.716
Is that you take me ...
off guard.

01:11:42.883 --> 01:11:44.969
- What would you do in my place?

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:48.681
- I do not know but...
you're fine, though.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:54.395
- Are you so naive?
Or are you just scared?

01:11:54.561 --> 01:11:56.271
- Of course I'm scared.

01:11:56.438 --> 01:11:59.191
How could I do
something like that?

01:11:59.358 --> 01:12:01.443
No, I can not do that.

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.237
No really.

01:12:03.404 --> 01:12:07.074
- Do not do in your pants,
Marcelino.

01:12:10.119 --> 01:12:11.578
Forget that.

01:12:12.496 --> 01:12:15.457
I was stupid
for having proposed it to you.

01:12:17.126 --> 01:12:18.585
- I can not...

01:12:19.128 --> 01:12:20.587
- Come on, keep going.

01:12:28.595 --> 01:12:31.515
Cello Solo

01:12:53.037 --> 01:12:54.913
Applause

01:13:25.402 --> 01:13:30.115
Inaudible

01:13:32.034 --> 01:13:35.245
- Dear friends,
I want to thank you,

01:13:35.412 --> 01:13:36.580
in the name of our family,

01:13:36.789 --> 01:13:39.249
to have accepted so promptly

01:13:39.416 --> 01:13:41.960
and in so many
our invitation

01:13:42.127 --> 01:13:45.547
to celebrate with us
the 85 years of dad.

01:13:45.756 --> 01:13:50.260
These last weeks
were quite agitated,

01:13:50.469 --> 01:13:51.887
but we are happy

01:13:52.054 --> 01:13:55.182
that our hero of the day
so quickly recovered,

01:13:55.349 --> 01:13:57.726
and we hope
that he will soon be reinstated.

01:13:57.893 --> 01:13:59.228
Because as you say:

01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:02.272
"Weed always grows."

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:07.444
We also have good reasons
to rejoice.

01:14:07.653 --> 01:14:11.490
Many do not know,
but after Paul's birth,

01:14:11.698 --> 01:14:15.244
our family
has grown even larger,

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:19.039
this time so
totally unexpected.

01:14:19.248 --> 01:14:21.458
Eve, Thomas's daughter,

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:24.878
from his first marriage,
will join us

01:14:25.045 --> 01:14:27.798
and will now share our life.

01:14:27.965 --> 01:14:31.927
Eve, we are very happy
to have you with us.

01:14:32.177 --> 01:14:34.513
Applause

01:14:42.771 --> 01:14:45.983
I do not want to hold you back
Longer.

01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:49.361
Miss, thank you for
this magnificent musical moment.

01:14:49.570 --> 01:14:53.031
You gave
a great joy to dad.

01:14:53.198 --> 01:14:57.452
After the spiritual pleasures,
here is the earthly food.

01:14:57.661 --> 01:14:59.329
The weather is with us.

01:14:59.496 --> 01:15:02.124
The air is exquisitely sweet,

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.668
we ordered it for dad.

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:06.545
The buffet is waiting for you.

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:08.589
Have a great evening.

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:11.258
Applause

01:15:28.358 --> 01:15:30.319
I'm glad you're here.

01:15:30.485 --> 01:15:32.654
- How are you?
- Very good.

01:15:32.905 --> 01:15:36.116
- As soon as dad gets out
of his young admirers,

01:15:36.283 --> 01:15:37.784
I will take you to see him.

01:15:37.951 --> 01:15:39.494
- I remove my plaster in a month.

01:15:39.661 --> 01:15:41.079
- He appreciates their company,

01:15:41.246 --> 01:15:43.999
even if he can not hear anything
from what they tell.

01:15:44.166 --> 01:15:47.085
He has always been
amateur of the fair sex.

01:15:47.544 --> 01:15:49.046
- He looks good.

01:15:49.213 --> 01:15:51.173
- That's very nice.
- Awesome.

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:53.508
His accident is still recent.

01:15:53.675 --> 01:15:55.219
- Yes, he's amazing.

01:15:56.094 --> 01:15:57.846
He will be happy to see you again.

01:15:58.013 --> 01:16:00.224
Do not tell him anything for us.

01:16:01.183 --> 01:16:03.143
- The theologian, he tries

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.604
in a dark room,
with black walls,

01:16:05.771 --> 01:16:09.524
to find a black cat
which supposedly exists.

01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:13.403
- I'm here on weekends
and he can only in the week.

01:16:14.655 --> 01:16:17.199
- How long has it lasted?
- Since...

01:16:17.407 --> 01:16:20.452
Saturday, it will be 3 weeks.
It's ridiculous.

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:21.954
- No why?

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.581
- Do you think that's stupid?
- No. There is no reason.

01:16:24.748 --> 01:16:27.918
- So it's possible?
- I'll arrange that for you.

01:16:28.085 --> 01:16:30.170
- I do not know what to say.

01:16:30.337 --> 01:16:33.465
- Tell me, we're going to burst
the buffet, cousin?

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:34.883
- If you want.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:38.512
- What's the matter?
Are not you hungry?

01:16:38.679 --> 01:16:40.138
Come on, come on.

01:16:40.764 --> 01:16:42.474
- Seaview,
it's up to 8 or 9.

01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:46.687
- Yes, in the luxury category.
- It will go down thanks to the English.

01:16:46.853 --> 01:16:48.814
- The south of me not enchant.

01:16:48.981 --> 01:16:51.525
We sweat,
and we are incapable of thinking.

01:16:51.692 --> 01:16:54.569
- But if you know her,
the one with the piercing voice.

01:16:54.736 --> 01:16:58.198
- She sold to give
money has children.

01:16:58.365 --> 01:17:01.034
She says she can not anymore
swim.

01:17:02.035 --> 01:17:03.412
- What do you like?

01:17:04.788 --> 01:17:06.832
- I'll manage.

01:17:06.999 --> 01:17:08.750
- How old are you?

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:10.002
- 13 years.

01:17:10.585 --> 01:17:12.129
- That's it...

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:15.966
Excuse me.
Look what tempts you.

01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:17.801
I'm going for a drink.

01:17:17.968 --> 01:17:20.637
- I find it discriminatory.

01:17:20.804 --> 01:17:23.473
- You would like your post
to quotas?

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.561
- You're competent, it's not
because you are a woman.

01:17:27.728 --> 01:17:29.229
- Are you naive at this point?

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:32.524
- Look who's here.
What a nice surprise.

01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:33.984
Jamila

01:17:34.192 --> 01:17:35.610
and his rice tajine.

01:17:35.777 --> 01:17:39.114
You have to taste,
it's a real delight.

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:42.701
Jamila is our Moroccan slave.
A pearl.

01:17:42.909 --> 01:17:47.414
It's a gift from heaven,
she cooks like Alain Ducasse.

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:49.916
It's a real chance
to have it at our service.

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:51.835
He applauds.

01:17:52.044 --> 01:17:54.671
Congratulations, Jamila.
- Are you coming, dear?

01:17:54.838 --> 01:17:59.009
It would be nice if you came
congratulate grandfather. Come.

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:09.644
- An operation is planned
in 2018, in autumn or summer ...

01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.149
Dad, excuse me for disturbing you.

01:18:14.316 --> 01:18:16.943
Eve has something to tell you.

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.446
- Yes?

01:18:19.613 --> 01:18:22.491
- Happy Birthday.
- Thank you.

01:18:25.202 --> 01:18:28.914
So we do not kiss me
for my birthday?

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:34.419
But who are you, my dear?

01:18:34.628 --> 01:18:36.380
- Hello ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:40.258
Thank you
to have all come today.

01:18:40.425 --> 01:18:42.803
I have to express again here

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:47.891
the compassion of my clients
with regard to this unfortunate accident.

01:18:48.308 --> 01:18:51.895
As you know, the investigation
of the labor inspectorate,

01:18:52.062 --> 01:18:54.898
ordered after the facts,
did not highlight

01:18:55.065 --> 01:18:57.526
no clues
faulty behavior

01:18:57.692 --> 01:19:01.321
or guilt
from the Laurent company.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:04.616
We can therefore consider

01:19:04.783 --> 01:19:07.369
that the prosecutor will close
the folder

01:19:07.536 --> 01:19:11.706
of routine criminal procedure
who was diligent.

01:19:11.873 --> 01:19:13.625
Moreover, in my opinion,

01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:18.296
civil liability
of my clients is not engaged.

01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.300
But Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence
are aware,

01:19:22.467 --> 01:19:25.762
outside other aspects
tragic events of this accident,

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:30.517
financial difficulties
that it causes your family.

01:19:30.684 --> 01:19:33.895
Especially with regard to
minor children

01:19:34.062 --> 01:19:36.731
that you will have
long time dependent.

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:38.108
In theory,

01:19:38.275 --> 01:19:42.070
you could try
to argue in court

01:19:42.237 --> 01:19:43.780
your possible right

01:19:43.947 --> 01:19:48.452
to compensation on the basis
of civil responsibility,

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:51.079
although,
as I mentioned,

01:19:51.246 --> 01:19:53.623
I do not see
no legal basis

01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:55.292
to such an approach.

01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:58.003
Despite this, our constituents

01:19:58.170 --> 01:20:01.506
are willing to help you
in this difficult situation,

01:20:01.673 --> 01:20:04.801
and to pay you
the sum of 35 000 euros

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:08.221
to help you at least
on the financial plan.

01:20:08.388 --> 01:20:10.974
However, nothing obliges them.

01:20:11.141 --> 01:20:15.270
You are not required to accept
immediately the offer,

01:20:15.437 --> 01:20:18.899
and avoid wearing
the case in court.

01:20:19.065 --> 01:20:21.610
Talk to your lawyer

01:20:21.776 --> 01:20:25.238
and then let me know
your position.

01:20:27.491 --> 01:20:30.368
As for the incident
in front of you,

01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:34.206
which we found
the witness, Mrs. Delorme,

01:20:34.372 --> 01:20:37.959
she also resident of the building,

01:20:38.710 --> 01:20:42.255
the prosecutor has not yet
knowledge.

01:20:42.422 --> 01:20:45.050
It's up to you
let him know nothing.

01:20:45.217 --> 01:20:50.138
And that there is no procedure
compensation. You follow me?

01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.225
- I dunno.

01:20:54.601 --> 01:20:56.811
- Why did not you tell us anything?

01:20:57.896 --> 01:21:00.148
- What?
- How what?

01:21:00.941 --> 01:21:02.943
How unhappy you are,

01:21:03.109 --> 01:21:06.112
that you miss your mother,
that you feel alone ...

01:21:07.572 --> 01:21:09.616
We can not be in your place.

01:21:09.783 --> 01:21:11.243
- So what?

01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:12.994
- And what?

01:21:22.379 --> 01:21:23.421
- You're so far.

01:21:35.308 --> 01:21:36.810
- I love you so much.

01:21:40.814 --> 01:21:42.774
You must believe me.

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:45.318
I am awkward, but I love you.

01:21:47.904 --> 01:21:51.449
- You'll take me with you,
if you leave Ana's?

01:21:51.616 --> 01:21:53.868
- What?
- Will you take me with you?

01:21:56.621 --> 01:22:00.166
- What is this madness?
Why would I leave Ana's?

01:22:00.333 --> 01:22:03.545
- I'm four years old
until my majority.

01:22:03.712 --> 01:22:06.298
I will not go to a home.

01:22:06.464 --> 01:22:09.134
- What are you talking about?
Why would you go to a home?

01:22:12.387 --> 01:22:13.388
- OK.

01:22:14.431 --> 01:22:15.974
- What OK"?

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:17.809
You're crazy?

01:22:20.604 --> 01:22:23.607
I love you. Nobody will put you
in a home.

01:22:23.815 --> 01:22:26.651
Where are you going to draw such ideas?

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:31.323
- You'll take me with you,
if you leave Ana's?

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:36.202
- I'm not leaving Ana's.
How are you?

01:22:36.369 --> 01:22:38.580
Can we have
a normal discussion

01:22:38.788 --> 01:22:40.081
now?

01:22:43.418 --> 01:22:46.379
- I heard you,
when you are telephoning at the beach.

01:22:46.546 --> 01:22:48.131
And I read everything.

01:22:48.882 --> 01:22:51.384
- What?
- I read your messages.

01:22:53.345 --> 01:22:54.888
- What messages?

01:22:55.513 --> 01:22:57.307
- Dad. Please.

01:22:57.807 --> 01:23:01.353
Stop playing comedy.
I know

01:23:01.561 --> 01:23:03.521
that you do not love anyone

01:23:03.688 --> 01:23:07.108
You did not like mom,
you do not like Ana's,

01:23:07.275 --> 01:23:10.487
you do not like this Claire
and you do not love me either.

01:23:10.654 --> 01:23:11.821
It is not serious.

01:23:13.281 --> 01:23:15.784
I just do not want to go
in a home.

01:23:24.376 --> 01:23:26.753
- Why did you take
Mom's medicines?

01:23:30.924 --> 01:23:32.717
- There was enough left.

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:36.721
- You took the rest,
just in case.

01:23:36.888 --> 01:23:38.056
- Yes.

01:23:39.974 --> 01:23:42.769
- The loan is matched
following conditions:

01:23:42.936 --> 01:23:44.104
3.1 ...

01:23:44.729 --> 01:23:47.899
Ms. Anne Laurent
will pledge Wilberg & Hopkins Bank

01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:52.028
of all his shares in the company
Laurent Public Works

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:54.280
as a guarantee of the loan,

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:57.075
And this,
until full refund.

01:23:57.242 --> 01:23:58.410
3.2 ...

01:23:58.785 --> 01:24:01.287
Pierre Laurent
will be removed from office

01:24:01.454 --> 01:24:04.165
Director General
of Laurent Public Works

01:24:04.332 --> 01:24:07.210
and replaced
by a new general manager

01:24:07.377 --> 01:24:11.423
who will be named
by the bank Wilberg & Hopkins,

01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:13.967
in agreement with Mrs. Anne Laurent.

01:24:14.718 --> 01:24:15.593
- Here is the agreement

01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.595
negotiated with your lawyer.

01:24:17.762 --> 01:24:20.014
I suppose
that you still approve.

01:24:21.433 --> 01:24:25.311
So I will ask you to sign
on behalf of the company,

01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:28.022
and also,
as a shareholder,

01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:30.859
in your own name.

01:24:33.862 --> 01:24:36.406
Our legal department
will handle with Me Barin

01:24:36.573 --> 01:24:40.660
necessary documents
implementation of the agreement.

01:24:54.883 --> 01:24:55.884
- We're done?

01:24:56.176 --> 01:24:57.218
- Yes.

01:24:58.636 --> 01:25:00.638
I look forward
of our collaboration.

01:25:01.389 --> 01:25:04.934
My friendships to your father.
To treat with him was a pleasure.

01:25:05.101 --> 01:25:06.436
- I'll give it to him.

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:13.777
Goodbye.

01:25:16.112 --> 01:25:18.072
- I'm going to accompany you
Mrs. Laurent.

01:25:29.918 --> 01:25:33.254
Keys on the computer keyboard

01:26:26.224 --> 01:26:28.685
- Dad told me that you wanted
talk to me?

01:26:31.563 --> 01:26:32.564
- No.

01:26:34.774 --> 01:26:36.234
Actually no.

01:26:44.742 --> 01:26:46.202
Do you want cheese?

01:26:49.038 --> 01:26:50.415
- No thanks.

01:26:51.416 --> 01:26:54.335
- It's not bad.
- I do not like cheese.

01:26:56.337 --> 01:26:57.213
- So.

01:27:02.176 --> 01:27:04.846
Make a decision:
do you come in or go out?

01:27:07.849 --> 01:27:10.059
Or do you want to stay there?

01:27:13.646 --> 01:27:17.150
Shut the door, princess,
and come and sit down.

01:27:30.455 --> 01:27:31.664
You are scared?

01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:33.541
- No.

01:27:34.417 --> 01:27:35.710
- So come here.

01:27:38.254 --> 01:27:40.048
Come on, come on.

01:27:44.719 --> 01:27:45.720
Good.

01:27:48.014 --> 01:27:50.975
Your father is telling tales.

01:27:51.142 --> 01:27:53.436
I did not want to talk to you.

01:27:53.603 --> 01:27:56.606
He asked me
to do.

01:27:57.148 --> 01:28:00.026
He says you do not have
faith in him,

01:28:00.234 --> 01:28:01.903
and he is worried.

01:28:03.863 --> 01:28:06.491
Why did you want to commit suicide?

01:28:12.163 --> 01:28:14.332
I will tell you something.

01:28:14.499 --> 01:28:18.461
You stay standing, you sit down
if you want, as you want.

01:28:19.462 --> 01:28:21.339
You did not know your grandmother.

01:28:21.547 --> 01:28:23.675
When you came,
you were little.

01:28:23.841 --> 01:28:26.344
You can not remember.

01:28:26.511 --> 01:28:28.012
Is not it?

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:32.976
Hold on.

01:28:56.124 --> 01:28:57.333
Come here.

01:29:00.878 --> 01:29:01.838
Come.

01:29:09.762 --> 01:29:10.888
Viewing.

01:29:21.441 --> 01:29:23.609
She was a beautiful woman.

01:29:24.569 --> 01:29:25.778
No?

01:29:29.157 --> 01:29:32.035
When you came here,
she was sick.

01:29:32.201 --> 01:29:33.411
You have never seen her.

01:29:34.412 --> 01:29:37.331
She was paralyzed in her bed ...

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:40.043
she spoke more.

01:29:40.918 --> 01:29:42.712
I took care of her.

01:29:43.755 --> 01:29:48.676
I entrusted the company to your aunt
to have the time.

01:29:48.843 --> 01:29:52.305
At the end, after 3 years
of suffering

01:29:52.472 --> 01:29:54.515
disgusting

01:29:55.725 --> 01:29:57.435
and absurd ...

01:30:00.980 --> 01:30:02.690
I choked it.

01:30:06.569 --> 01:30:09.322
It was a fair decision.

01:30:09.489 --> 01:30:12.200
I do not regret it
one moment.

01:30:17.163 --> 01:30:20.374
That's the whole story
that I wanted to tell you.

01:30:20.541 --> 01:30:22.251
You tell me your story?

01:30:26.047 --> 01:30:27.757
- What a story?

01:30:28.591 --> 01:30:31.511
- Why did you take
these tablets?

01:30:35.515 --> 01:30:38.935
You think I'm too stupid
to understand that?

01:30:42.855 --> 01:30:43.940
Huh?

01:30:46.234 --> 01:30:47.902
Sit down, then.

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:07.296
- Once, I tried to poison
a classmate.

01:31:09.715 --> 01:31:10.925
- And ...

01:31:12.176 --> 01:31:13.302
- Finally...

01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:16.973
not really poison.

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:20.685
Mom had sent me
in a summer camp,

01:31:20.852 --> 01:31:22.937
when daddy is gone.

01:31:23.479 --> 01:31:26.566
They gave me Lexomil
to calm myself.

01:31:27.358 --> 01:31:30.278
I had to take
half a day.

01:31:30.987 --> 01:31:32.113
I did not want it.

01:31:35.908 --> 01:31:38.619
There was a girl
I did not like

01:31:39.162 --> 01:31:42.039
I put the tablets
in his meals.

01:31:44.208 --> 01:31:47.837
It was funny to see her
more and more calm.

01:31:49.589 --> 01:31:52.800
One day, she collapsed.

01:31:53.009 --> 01:31:56.053
They did some analysis
and they understood.

01:31:56.220 --> 01:31:59.265
- So what?
What happened?

01:31:59.432 --> 01:32:02.476
- Nothing. I had to leave the colony.

01:32:02.643 --> 01:32:04.270
- And go home?

01:32:06.772 --> 01:32:07.773
- Yes.

01:32:09.775 --> 01:32:10.985
- And?

01:32:12.069 --> 01:32:14.197
Did it hurt you?

01:32:14.864 --> 01:32:16.324
- Not a lot.

01:32:18.242 --> 01:32:19.243
Yes...

01:32:21.245 --> 01:32:23.247
Yes, it hurt me.

01:32:23.414 --> 01:32:25.041
Later.

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:28.544
The girl was not nice,
but she could do nothing.

01:32:32.048 --> 01:32:34.300
- The other day,

01:32:34.467 --> 01:32:37.720
I was looking at the garden
and I saw, by chance,

01:32:37.887 --> 01:32:40.348
a raptor

01:32:40.514 --> 01:32:42.558
shred a small bird.

01:32:43.768 --> 01:32:45.895
He caught it in midair,

01:32:46.062 --> 01:32:49.357
and he stirred it
in all directions,

01:32:50.191 --> 01:32:51.317
and then after,

01:32:51.525 --> 01:32:54.779
he shredded it
on the floor with its beak.

01:32:54.946 --> 01:32:56.781
Really shredded.

01:32:56.948 --> 01:32:59.367
Feathers flew and fell.

01:32:59.533 --> 01:33:02.411
It looked like it had snowed.

01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:06.624
And then a car is passed,
the raptor has flown away.

01:33:06.791 --> 01:33:10.086
'Apart from the feathers, there was only
nothing of the victim.

01:33:12.755 --> 01:33:16.259
In any case
for what I saw from here.

01:33:18.052 --> 01:33:20.930
When you see this kind
things on TV,

01:33:21.097 --> 01:33:23.641
it seems normal to you.

01:33:23.808 --> 01:33:26.227
Nature is that.

01:33:26.394 --> 01:33:29.897
But when you see him
in reality...

01:33:32.483 --> 01:33:34.527
you have trembling hands.

01:33:37.822 --> 01:33:40.199
Why did you do that?

01:33:40.366 --> 01:33:41.826
- What?

01:33:41.993 --> 01:33:43.703
- Tablets.

01:33:46.914 --> 01:33:48.708
- I dunno.

01:33:52.962 --> 01:33:54.297
I dunno.

01:33:56.757 --> 01:33:59.010
- And there, it hurts you, the?

01:34:00.386 --> 01:34:02.096
- He just nipped it.

01:34:02.263 --> 01:34:03.681
(In Arabic)
- How can you say that?

01:34:03.848 --> 01:34:05.057
He bit her.

01:34:05.224 --> 01:34:06.892
She cried.

01:34:07.101 --> 01:34:09.937
- They were playing. He followed her
and he nibbled it.

01:34:10.104 --> 01:34:12.064
It does not matter.

01:34:12.273 --> 01:34:14.567
You should have been careful.

01:34:14.734 --> 01:34:15.901
- It's serious?

01:34:17.111 --> 01:34:18.779
- No, no, that's fine. It's okay.

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:22.033
You're a little girl
very brave.

01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:24.160
There, do not worry.

01:34:24.327 --> 01:34:26.787
I will give an ointment
to your mom,

01:34:26.954 --> 01:34:31.667
she'll put it to you, and tomorrow
you will not feel anything.

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:35.921
Well, it's ok but ...

01:34:36.088 --> 01:34:38.174
be careful
with the dog.

01:34:38.341 --> 01:34:40.760
It's not us
that he is supposed to bite.

01:34:40.926 --> 01:34:42.386
Do you have a paper?

01:34:42.553 --> 01:34:45.389
I will make an order.

01:34:45.556 --> 01:34:49.352
- What does she have?
- It's okay. It's just the shock.

01:34:49.518 --> 01:34:52.229

- Thank you.

01:34:59.612 --> 01:35:01.155

01:35:19.924 --> 01:35:21.634

*

01:35:24.011 --> 01:35:26.680
As soon as it starts,
you take a chocolate.

01:35:26.847 --> 01:35:29.392
Like that
you will have worse at all.

01:35:29.558 --> 01:35:31.060
Okay?

01:35:31.727 --> 01:35:33.979
Well, you have to sleep now.

01:35:34.146 --> 01:35:38.859
It's late. And tomorrow will be
still a beautiful day.

01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:40.569
Hmm?

01:35:50.913 --> 01:35:52.998
I was completely panicked.

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:55.584
- Yes, it was terrible.

01:35:56.293 --> 01:35:58.462
She is crying a lot.

01:35:59.588 --> 01:36:03.175
- You have to control the dog ...
- I told him.

01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:07.596
You will put this ointment
to prevent inflammation.

01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:09.557
Okay? I arrive.

01:36:09.723 --> 01:36:12.226

01:36:12.393 --> 01:36:15.187
- No risk.
Do not worry.

01:36:15.354 --> 01:36:18.399
- All my congratulations, madam.

01:36:18.566 --> 01:36:19.900
- Why?

01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:22.736
- Mrs. Ana's told me.

01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:25.364
- But what did she tell you?

01:36:25.906 --> 01:36:27.741
Ah, the engagement.

01:36:28.367 --> 01:36:30.077
Ah, that's nice, thank you.

01:36:30.244 --> 01:36:32.288
- Huh, Selin?
- You've finished?

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:34.665
- Yes. Good.

01:36:34.832 --> 01:36:37.543
You put him twice a day,
morning and evening.

01:36:37.710 --> 01:36:39.962
I will return tomorrow. Good evening.

01:36:40.671 --> 01:36:42.465
- Good evening.
- Good evening madam.

01:36:42.631 --> 01:36:44.800
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:36:47.136 --> 01:36:49.138
- Mrs?
- Yes?

01:36:51.182 --> 01:36:52.975
- Are you going from here?

01:36:54.268 --> 01:36:56.604
- And you go get that or?

01:36:56.812 --> 01:36:59.982
Keys on the computer keyboard

01:37:12.620 --> 01:37:13.746
- 'Eve?

01:37:17.917 --> 01:37:19.001
'Eve?

01:37:25.591 --> 01:37:27.384
Ah, you're here.

01:37:27.551 --> 01:37:29.261
I have to go to town,

01:37:29.428 --> 01:37:33.057
and I wanted to ask you
if you could keep Paul.

01:37:33.224 --> 01:37:35.684
What are you doing
in Thomas's office?

01:37:35.851 --> 01:37:37.478
- Nothing. I just wanted...

01:37:37.645 --> 01:37:39.939
My Mac crashed.
Nothing works.

01:37:40.105 --> 01:37:44.193
I wanted to see on Dad's computer.
But that did not work.

01:37:44.401 --> 01:37:47.279
He has a new code.
- What?

01:37:47.446 --> 01:37:49.532
- Nothing. It's too complicated.

01:37:49.698 --> 01:37:53.369
- Well, well ... ask him
when he arrives.

01:37:53.536 --> 01:37:54.828
You stay here?

01:37:55.037 --> 01:37:58.165
I do not have one for a long time.
He is sleeping.

01:37:58.332 --> 01:38:00.417
- I'm going to put myself
in his room.

01:38:00.584 --> 01:38:01.961
- Thank you.

01:38:07.508 --> 01:38:11.095
You want me to bring you
Something?

01:38:11.262 --> 01:38:13.639
- No. Thank you. I need nothing.

01:38:24.525 --> 01:38:28.362
- Excuse me ma'am.
We serve the main course

01:38:28.529 --> 01:38:31.657
Or do you prefer to take a break?
- Good question.

01:38:31.907 --> 01:38:33.450
Cheri, what do you think?

01:38:33.617 --> 01:38:37.037
We go to the main course
where are we still waiting a little?

01:38:37.371 --> 01:38:38.998
- No idea, how you want.

01:38:39.164 --> 01:38:41.542
- No, you can go on,
It's hot.

01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:43.752
- Good. As you want.

01:38:45.170 --> 01:38:46.380
- How are you, Dad?

01:38:46.589 --> 01:38:48.299
You're feeling good?

01:38:49.925 --> 01:38:53.095
- I feel very good.
Perfectly well.

01:39:00.686 --> 01:39:01.895
- Excuse me.

01:39:04.523 --> 01:39:06.942
Excuse me for disturbing you.

01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:09.194
We have to leave
after lunch

01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:11.196
and I have to talk to you about it
- Yes?

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:13.866
- Can you lend me
your babysitter tomorrow?

01:39:14.033 --> 01:39:16.827
Mine is gone
for 15 days.

01:39:16.994 --> 01:39:19.121
The replacement has a cold.

01:39:19.288 --> 01:39:21.457
- Yes. It should be possible.

01:39:21.624 --> 01:39:23.917
Tomorrow, I ... wait ...

01:39:24.084 --> 01:39:27.129
Yes it's good.
But only tomorrow ...

01:39:27.296 --> 01:39:28.839
- Excuse me, mom.

01:39:29.006 --> 01:39:31.342
I am sorry
to be late.

01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:35.471
I had to change
before attending this feast.

01:39:35.638 --> 01:39:38.349
I hope that you will find me
presentable.

01:39:38.557 --> 01:39:41.560
Your speeches have no doubt
been awesome,

01:39:41.727 --> 01:39:44.271
and I regret
to have missed them.

01:39:44.438 --> 01:39:47.650
- Pierre...
- But to make me forgive,

01:39:47.816 --> 01:39:49.985
and to please you
mom...

01:39:50.152 --> 01:39:51.070
- Who is it?

01:39:51.278 --> 01:39:54.948
- I came with guests,
happy to join

01:39:55.115 --> 01:39:57.159
at this party
for your engagement.

01:39:57.409 --> 01:39:58.827
- Please, calm down.

01:39:59.495 --> 01:40:00.746
Stop this circus.

01:40:00.913 --> 01:40:02.915
- There is really nothing to stop.

01:40:03.082 --> 01:40:05.918
And it's not you who will tell me
what has to be done.

01:40:06.919 --> 01:40:08.754
- All we want is ...

01:40:09.046 --> 01:40:11.298
<i> - Fuck you, motherfucker. </i>

01:40:12.007 --> 01:40:14.176
- Please excuse me
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:40:14.385 --> 01:40:17.721
It's good, Thomas,
you can sit still

01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:20.099
I ask your attention.

01:40:20.265 --> 01:40:24.520
The time we serve the dish
main, everything will be finished.

01:40:24.687 --> 01:40:27.564
I would like to introduce you to my friends.

01:40:27.773 --> 01:40:30.067
- Stopped.
- Mingle with your onions.

01:40:30.234 --> 01:40:34.446
It's Mohammed. He comes from Nigeria.
His wife and children

01:40:34.655 --> 01:40:38.158
were burned.
- You can take me ...

01:40:38.325 --> 01:40:39.827
sweetheart?

01:40:39.993 --> 01:40:42.746
- It took him a year
to arrive here.

01:40:42.913 --> 01:40:45.457
He comes out of the "jungle"
and walk to the tunnel,

01:40:45.624 --> 01:40:48.836
in the hope of being able
finally cross.

01:40:49.044 --> 01:40:52.256
Hope is what dies
Lastly.

01:40:56.009 --> 01:40:57.636
And here is Youssouf.

01:40:57.803 --> 01:41:00.055
If I say no nonsense, he ...

01:41:00.222 --> 01:41:01.849
Hello Mom.

01:41:08.397 --> 01:41:10.190
Cry of pain

01:41:14.236 --> 01:41:16.280
- Sorry. but what is
what could I do?

01:41:16.447 --> 01:41:17.698
- Ah.

01:41:19.742 --> 01:41:22.077
- Come. Let's go.

01:41:35.841 --> 01:41:37.676
- Ladies and gentlemen.

01:41:37.843 --> 01:41:41.054
I'm sorry...
you had to attend

01:41:41.221 --> 01:41:43.432
to this painful scene.

01:41:44.183 --> 01:41:48.228
My son has problems.
He is under medical treatment.

01:41:48.395 --> 01:41:51.023
You must not blame him, here it is.

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:55.027
But my son is a good person.

01:41:55.194 --> 01:41:57.070
I am really...

01:41:57.279 --> 01:41:59.573
deeply sorry.

01:41:59.740 --> 01:42:01.909
You're welcome,
resume your places.

01:42:02.075 --> 01:42:05.662
In the name of our friendship.
Sit down.

01:42:14.922 --> 01:42:16.006
- Over there.

01:42:25.098 --> 01:42:28.644
- Our apologies
for this painful situation.

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:33.398
Please, do us the honor
to join you.

01:42:33.565 --> 01:42:35.526
My son thought he would do well.

01:42:36.819 --> 01:42:37.986
You're welcome...

01:42:38.445 --> 01:42:40.614
They speak in a low voice.

01:43:32.875 --> 01:43:34.209
Further.

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:45.888
You can go now.

01:45:22.401 --> 01:45:23.610
- Dad.
