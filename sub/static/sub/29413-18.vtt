WEBVTT

00:09.183 --> 00:11.011
Hey, what's up,
little man?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.751
Oh, hi, Mr. Calvin.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.058
Me and my dad are about
to do some hoops.

00:15.102 --> 00:18.061
I think you mean
"shoot some hoops."

00:18.105 --> 00:19.497
No, he doesn't.

00:21.325 --> 00:24.633
Tryouts for the Walcott Academy
Hula-Hoop squad are next week,

00:24.676 --> 00:27.636
and Grover's got to
get his game hips on.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.640
Hula-Hoop tryouts?
Mm-hmm.

00:31.683 --> 00:32.815
Don't you just show up

00:32.858 --> 00:35.165
and any kid who has asthma
is in?

00:35.209 --> 00:36.993
Actually, it is
very competitive.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.690
It's the second most
popular sport at school,

00:38.734 --> 00:40.518
after Mathletics.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.477
And that one's for nerds.

00:43.913 --> 00:46.176
So, are you telling me
that no one

00:46.220 --> 00:50.572
at this little hippie school
of yours plays real sports?

00:50.615 --> 00:53.749
How do you tell the cool kids
from the losers?

00:53.792 --> 00:56.143
Oh, Caleb's definitely cool.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.710
He can Hula-Hoop
around his neck.

01:00.277 --> 01:02.975
And his dad won't let
anyone forget it.

01:03.019 --> 01:05.587
Okay, listen to me, Dave.

01:05.630 --> 01:08.068
Look, the youth basketball team
I coach

01:08.111 --> 01:09.678
is starting a new season.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.767
Do Grover a favor--
let him join us.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.601
Like, right now.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.518
I don't know. You know,
Grover's never played

01:23.561 --> 01:25.346
organized sports before.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.130
Come on, Dave,
it'll be good for him.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.089
Like... look,
I don't like to brag,

01:29.132 --> 01:31.047
but I'm the best coach in town.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.964
Maybe in all of California.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.576
I guess it would be
good for Grover

01:38.620 --> 01:39.664
to learn about
winning and losing.

01:39.708 --> 01:41.405
Not on my team.

01:41.449 --> 01:44.147
No, we've gone undefeated
the last two seasons.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.584
He's gonna have to learn
that losing part from you.

01:48.020 --> 01:49.979
All right, what do you say, bud?

01:50.022 --> 01:51.981
You want to join
Mr. Calvin's basketball team?

01:52.024 --> 01:53.765
Sure. Sounds fun.

01:53.809 --> 01:58.030
Great. Practice starts
tomorrow, but for now,

01:58.074 --> 02:00.163
why don't you show me
what you got.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.296
All right, now, come on, buddy.All right.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.211
Show him those Johnson skills.

02:05.255 --> 02:07.257
CALVIN:
Come on. All right.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.961
You know what, uh,
let's try it with this one.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.487
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:19.530 --> 02:20.836
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:26.581 --> 02:27.669
Hey, Mom.

02:27.712 --> 02:29.888
Hey. How was
basketball practice?

02:29.932 --> 02:32.239
It was great!
Coach Calvin made me

02:32.282 --> 02:34.676
the most important position
on the team.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.417
Really? That's incredible.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.245
What are you, the point guard?

02:38.288 --> 02:39.420
Better.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.161
The equipment manager!

02:45.513 --> 02:47.645
What? You can't be
the equipment manager.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.430
That's the job
they give the kids who...

02:49.473 --> 02:53.390
Who care the most
about the team.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.437
It's so cool.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.483
I'm in charge of
the basketballs and towels,

02:59.527 --> 03:02.704
and no one gets Gatorade
without going through me.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.488
Mm.

03:04.532 --> 03:06.534
Yeah, he might not need
to wear a cup, but...

03:06.577 --> 03:09.493
he sure
can fill one.

03:09.537 --> 03:12.627
I'm gonna go practice
handing out orange slices.

03:14.759 --> 03:17.458
If only Caleb could see me now.

03:18.502 --> 03:20.243
Yeah, you go get 'em, son!

03:21.592 --> 03:24.073
Kid's got a heart of a champion.

03:24.116 --> 03:25.683
No, what the kid has got is

03:25.727 --> 03:27.250
the most embarrassing job
on the team.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.731
Ugh! Being the equipment manager
is like being

03:29.774 --> 03:31.820
the tree in the school play.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.388
Hey, I was the tree
in the school play.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.392
Don't throw shade
until you've provided it.

03:38.435 --> 03:40.307
Oh, God.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.572
Seriously, how could you
let Calvin do that to him?

03:44.615 --> 03:46.269
Oh, well, Gemma...

03:46.313 --> 03:47.531
he was awful.

03:47.575 --> 03:49.968
I mean, he couldn't shoot,
he couldn't pass,

03:50.012 --> 03:53.058
and when he jumped,
I don't know, somehow...

03:53.102 --> 03:55.104
he got lower.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.499
How is that even possible?

03:58.542 --> 03:59.761
No one knows.

04:04.940 --> 04:07.203
Aw, how about this one?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.553
Your old hall monitor vest.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.557
Keep or trash it?

04:13.601 --> 04:16.343
Uh, trash. I don't want
to be one of those guys

04:16.386 --> 04:17.692
that's stuck
in his glory days.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.218
Whoa, what is
going on in here?

04:22.262 --> 04:25.134
Looks like somebody turned a
nerd upside down and shook him.

04:26.918 --> 04:30.008
No, we're just clearing out
a few of Marty's old things.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.706
Your father was complaining
about my stuff

04:31.749 --> 04:33.142
crowding his side of the closet.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.318
Oh, so you're moving
some of your stuff here?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.667
No, his.

04:37.712 --> 04:39.148
And if he complains again,

04:39.191 --> 04:40.628
he's getting moved here, too.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.806
Hey, check it out--
my old snake terrarium.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.199
Oh, yeah,
I remember Slinky.

04:47.243 --> 04:49.245
You thought you would look cool
showing up at parties

04:49.289 --> 04:50.551
with a snake around your neck.

04:50.594 --> 04:53.031
Well, I would have
if he hadn't escaped.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.382
Or if you were ever invited
to a party.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.820
Malcolm, stop being so
mean to your brother.

04:58.863 --> 05:00.604
Yeah, thanks, Mom.Now, get your old,

05:00.648 --> 05:02.040
stupid childhood
crap out of here.

05:02.084 --> 05:04.478
Out of here.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.569
I don't blame Slinky
for running away.

05:08.612 --> 05:11.136
I would take off, too,
if my owner was

05:11.180 --> 05:14.226
an "Official Klingon
Ambassador."

05:14.270 --> 05:17.447
Well, actually...

05:17.491 --> 05:20.276
Slinky didn't exactly run away.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.495
What?

05:21.538 --> 05:22.583
Ooh, I hated that thing.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.367
It freaked the hell out of me.

05:24.411 --> 05:27.588
So, one day, you
boys were in school,

05:27.631 --> 05:30.591
and I put it in a bag and
drove it to the woods.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.464
You let it go?

05:34.508 --> 05:36.161
Yeah, let's go with that.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.904
I can't believe
Marty never found out.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.471
And he never will, right?

05:41.515 --> 05:44.648
Hey, well, don't worry,
I did not hear a thing.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.258
Yeah.

05:46.302 --> 05:47.738
But I did!

05:55.442 --> 05:57.531
Calvin.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.663
Oh. Hey, Gemma.

05:59.707 --> 06:00.795
Equipment manager?

06:00.838 --> 06:03.101
You made my son
the equipment manager?

06:03.145 --> 06:04.973
Hey.

06:05.016 --> 06:08.498
It's the most important person
on the team...

06:08.542 --> 06:11.240
who's not technically
on the team.

06:12.763 --> 06:14.722
Calvin, I played
varsity lacrosse,

06:14.765 --> 06:17.115
and we all know what happens
to equipment managers.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.727
They get teased and
shoved into lockers.

06:19.770 --> 06:22.730
At least that's what
we did to ours.

06:22.773 --> 06:25.646
Yeah, those were
the good old days, right?

06:25.689 --> 06:29.040
I stuffed more geeks
into lockers than I did books.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.870
Calvin, being on a team
made me resilient.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.611
It toughened me up.

06:34.655 --> 06:36.308
And that's what I
want for Grover.

06:36.352 --> 06:38.223
But...

06:38.267 --> 06:41.096
he's the worst player
I've ever coached.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.359
And I coached Marty.

06:44.969 --> 06:46.580
It was one practice.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.451
I'm sure he'll get better.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.148
Besides, I thought
you told Dave

06:50.192 --> 06:52.412
you were the best
coach in the world.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.718
I never said that.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.372
I'm not an egomaniac.

06:57.852 --> 06:59.375
I said California.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.378
Look, it was your idea

07:02.422 --> 07:04.728
to put him on the team
in the first place, so...

07:04.772 --> 07:06.121
put him on the team.

07:06.164 --> 07:09.864
Unless you want to be
stuffed into a locker.

07:18.568 --> 07:20.527
Wow.

07:20.570 --> 07:23.443
For a tiny little white girl,
she's kind of scary.

07:26.489 --> 07:27.621
I can't believe it.

07:27.664 --> 07:30.014
You murdered Slinky.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.712
Well, it was self-defense.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.714
As soon as he saw
my snakeskin boots,

07:33.757 --> 07:35.672
I knew he was coming for me.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.067
Yeah, hey, look, come on, Marty.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.635
It's been almost 15 years, man.
Let it go.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.375
Well, it's easy
for you to say.

07:43.419 --> 07:45.856
You're not the one
who loved him, cared for him,

07:45.900 --> 07:48.598
took him outside
for his nightly slithers.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.732
Okay, Marty,

07:51.775 --> 07:52.820
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have

07:52.863 --> 07:54.299
gotten rid of your
pet like that.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.171
What can I do to
make it up to you?

07:56.214 --> 07:57.389
Well, that depends.

07:57.433 --> 07:58.956
What else have you
lied to me about?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.828
Did my old Space Camp buddy
Winston Chang

08:00.871 --> 08:03.439
really move back to China,
or did you kill him, too?

08:06.094 --> 08:08.575
Okay, Marty, come on.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.794
Let me do something
to make you feel better.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.143
Like what?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.580
Anything. Just name it.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.278
Well, I-I do love
your seafood jambalaya.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.019
Oh.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.021
Wow.

08:20.064 --> 08:22.763
I mean, with all the shopping
and the prep,

08:22.806 --> 08:24.852
that's gonna take all day.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.723
Yeah, you're right.
It does take a lot of time.

08:26.767 --> 08:30.031
Yeah.Although death is forever.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.560
Okay. Fine.
I'll go to the market right now.

08:37.604 --> 08:38.822
Well, hey, Ma, since
you out there...

08:38.866 --> 08:40.084
I didn't kill your pet.

08:46.047 --> 08:48.440
Oh, man, I'm really
surprised how upset you are.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.834
I didn't realize how much
you loved that snake.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.533
Well, actually...

08:56.448 --> 08:58.233
I hated that damn thing!

08:58.276 --> 09:00.104
What?

09:00.148 --> 09:01.497
Well, it was terrifying.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.455
Like a giant piece
of spaghetti with teeth.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.416
All right, well,

09:07.459 --> 09:09.549
then why are you giving
Mama such a hard time?

09:09.592 --> 09:12.552
I'll tell you why-- to teach her
a lesson in honesty.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.902
By lying to her?

09:16.164 --> 09:18.427
Well, I-I wouldn't
call it lying.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.907
Okay, then what
would you call it?

09:19.950 --> 09:21.386
Well, I...

09:21.430 --> 09:23.606
Oh, give me a break, Malcolm.
I'm in mourning.

09:23.650 --> 09:25.434
What?

09:25.477 --> 09:28.306
Okay, Grover, you ever
heard the phrase

09:28.350 --> 09:30.439
"he got game"?Sure.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.962
Well, you ain't got none.

09:34.138 --> 09:36.924
But I promised your mom
I'd turn you into a player,

09:36.967 --> 09:38.621
and that's what I'm gonna do.

09:38.665 --> 09:43.147
But I can't dribble,
I can't shoot, I can't pass.

09:43.191 --> 09:46.455
Don't forget you suck
at rebounding, too.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.152
I know.
If I have to play,

09:48.196 --> 09:50.372
I'm just gonna go out there
and embarrass myself.

09:50.415 --> 09:53.201
Oh, oh, oh, don't worry.
Look, I got a plan.

09:53.244 --> 09:55.812
You remember when
Jorge tried to get

09:55.856 --> 09:57.814
the extra orange
slice at practice

09:57.858 --> 09:59.947
and you slapped his hand away?

09:59.990 --> 10:01.296
Not on my watch.

10:03.777 --> 10:08.869
That's why I'm gonna
make you the enforcer.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.218
The enforcer?

10:10.261 --> 10:12.960
That kind of sounds
like a superhero.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.265
It is.

10:14.309 --> 10:17.225
But instead of saving people,
your job

10:17.268 --> 10:19.009
is to elbow them,

10:19.053 --> 10:22.056
foul and scare the crap
out of other kids.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
Am I allowed to do that?

10:24.972 --> 10:27.017
Up to six times a game.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.890
Okay, so here.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.892
Pretend I'm on
the other team

10:31.935 --> 10:33.067
and we're fighting
for a rebound.

10:33.110 --> 10:34.372
Show me what you got.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.504
Come on.

10:40.074 --> 10:42.206
: And your mom
said I wasn't a good coach.

10:51.563 --> 10:54.915
Oh, look at Grover
out there.

10:54.958 --> 10:58.222
He looks so grown-up
in his uniform.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.398
Mommy loves you,
snuggle bug!

11:00.442 --> 11:01.922
Mommy!

11:03.532 --> 11:05.099
I'm so nervous for him.

11:05.142 --> 11:06.840
It feels like opening
night at the school play.

11:06.883 --> 11:08.493
My leaves were
shaking so bad,

11:08.537 --> 11:10.974
they had to add a line
about the gusty wind.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.630
Come on,
bring it in.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.284
All right, guys.

11:16.327 --> 11:17.938
We're gonna go out there,
we're gonna play hard,

11:17.981 --> 11:20.418
we're gonna have fun,
but most importantly,

11:20.462 --> 11:23.421
show good sportsmanship.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.293
Go Lions!TEAM: Roar!

11:25.336 --> 11:26.903
Let's get it.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.731
Whoa, whoa, hey, Grover.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.560
All that good sportsmanship
stuff doesn't apply to you.

11:31.603 --> 11:32.779
Got it.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.869
Hey-hey, and, uh,
here's your mouth guard.

11:35.912 --> 11:37.566
Safety first.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.002
Yours, not theirs.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.571
Thanks, Coach Calvin.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.402
Oh, my God,
Grover's starting.

11:48.185 --> 11:50.666
That's my son!
Number 12!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.059
That's my
snuggly son!

11:53.364 --> 11:55.627
Wow, yesterday Grover
was the water boy.

11:55.671 --> 11:57.020
Today he's in
the starting five.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.805
I mean, at this rate,
tomorrow he's gonna be...

12:01.198 --> 12:03.200
Foul, number 12!

12:03.244 --> 12:05.289
...in jail.

12:15.473 --> 12:17.649
Dude.Yo, what's up, man?

12:17.693 --> 12:21.349
Don't tell me you guilted Mom
into baking you a pie?

12:21.392 --> 12:23.525
I sure did.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.136
Revenge is a dish
best served à la mode.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.098
Okay, Marty, I'm off
to clean your apartment.

12:31.968 --> 12:33.230
Thanks, Mama.

12:33.274 --> 12:35.842
Now, you sure you're okay
doing this for me?

12:35.885 --> 12:38.061
Oh, anything for my baby.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.585
Great. Make sure you use
the pine scent,

12:40.629 --> 12:42.370
because the lemon
tickles my nose.

12:42.413 --> 12:46.113
Okay, let me see if I have any.

12:46.156 --> 12:49.159
I should've took hisass
to the woods.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.772
You know what?
That's it, man.

12:52.815 --> 12:53.860
You're taking
this too far.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.296
I'm telling Mama the truth.

12:55.339 --> 12:57.124
Well, would a piece
of this delicious blueberry pie

12:57.167 --> 12:58.560
change your mind?

12:58.603 --> 13:00.954
Do you seriously think
you can buy me off with pie?

13:00.997 --> 13:03.173
What about tickets
to the Lakers game?

13:05.523 --> 13:07.308
Mama got you Laker tickets?

13:09.614 --> 13:12.487
Not yet, but if I can figure
out how to make myself cry,

13:12.530 --> 13:16.012
it'll be Jack Nicholson,
you, and me on the floor.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.581
Okay, I'm off.

13:19.624 --> 13:22.062
Here come the tears.Aah!

13:22.105 --> 13:26.022
Oh, oh...

13:26.066 --> 13:27.632
Oh, I know.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.072
It's okay, baby bro.

13:32.115 --> 13:34.030
Slinky's in heaven now.

13:37.207 --> 13:39.079
What the hell is going on
out there?

13:39.122 --> 13:41.168
Grover's
out of control.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.126
Okay, uh...

13:43.170 --> 13:45.041
so we got off to a pretty
aggressive start,

13:45.085 --> 13:47.000
but I think he's
beginning to calm down.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.481
I mean, he hasn't fouled
anybody in almost two minutes.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.440
Dave,
it's a time-out.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.792
Okay. Come on!

13:58.272 --> 14:00.187
Look, maybe Calvin
called the time-out

14:00.230 --> 14:02.102
to tell Grover
to keep his elbows to himself.

14:03.538 --> 14:05.061
REFEREE:
Foul, number 12!

14:08.673 --> 14:10.197
That's it.
I'm talking to Calvin.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.894
Okay, I'm coming, too.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.983
Even the parents on our team
look like they want to kill us.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.768
Come on, ref!

14:16.812 --> 14:18.379
That kid traveled so much,

14:18.422 --> 14:20.990
it's like he's going to see
his real daddy for the weekend.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.690
Calvin?

14:25.734 --> 14:28.128
What the hell?
Grover's acting like an animal!

14:28.171 --> 14:29.477
I know, right?

14:31.174 --> 14:34.612
Forget California, I may be
the best coach in the world.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.311
I asked you to teach him
how to play basketball,

14:37.354 --> 14:39.269
not turn him
into a goon.

14:39.313 --> 14:42.142
Hey, you told me
to toughen him up.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.752
Plus, we're winning.

14:43.795 --> 14:46.886
He might not even have
to use his last two fouls.

14:48.191 --> 14:50.324
REFEREE:
Foul, number 12!

14:52.326 --> 14:54.894
Okay, one foul.

14:56.243 --> 14:58.201
So you're not gonna do
anything about this?

14:58.245 --> 15:00.943
No. Not in the
middle of a game.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.597
Fine. Then I will.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.296
Hey!

15:08.211 --> 15:10.300
Oh, God, this is my mom
at the school play

15:10.344 --> 15:12.259
all over again.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.565
You want to teach my kid
how to play dirty?

15:14.609 --> 15:17.307
Good luck doing it without this.

15:26.490 --> 15:30.364
She does know we have a whole
rack of balls right here, right?

15:34.411 --> 15:36.152
This pie
is delicious.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.501
Yeah, I know.

15:37.545 --> 15:39.155
I always thought the
secret ingredient was love.

15:39.199 --> 15:42.724
Turns out, it's guilt.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.292
Hey, boys.
Hey.
Hey, Mama.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.336
What's that?

15:46.380 --> 15:48.948
A gift for you.
I think I finally

15:48.991 --> 15:50.819
figured out something
that will make up

15:50.862 --> 15:52.516
for what I
did to you.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.996
Oh, Mom,
you shouldn't have.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.693
Although, given
your savage betrayal,

15:55.737 --> 15:56.825
you probably should have.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.132
All right, well,

15:59.175 --> 16:00.698
open it, baby.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.178
Okay, well, whatever it is,

16:02.222 --> 16:03.353
hopefully it'll make me forget

16:03.397 --> 16:06.835
the memory of
my precious-- snake!

16:08.837 --> 16:13.363
Yeah. See, I realized
that there's no amount

16:13.407 --> 16:16.192
of cooking and cleaning
that could replace your snake.

16:16.236 --> 16:20.283
But maybe one that's
twice as big could.

16:20.327 --> 16:22.851
Ooh-ooh!Ah!

16:22.894 --> 16:25.288
Aw! Do you love it?

16:25.332 --> 16:26.637
I know Ido.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.335
Ooh.

16:28.378 --> 16:31.338
Here, come on, let me
put him around your neck.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.863
Oh, look at him. Oh,
look at that, aw...

16:37.083 --> 16:39.215
He's so cute.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.478
Look at him, Mama.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.393
He's so happy,
he's about to cry.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.310
He gonna die.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.530
Get it off.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.228
What, wha-what'd you say, baby?
I can't hear you.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.622
Get the snake--
get it-- get it off.Get it off?

16:54.665 --> 16:56.754
Like, take it off of your neck?
Oh, okay.

16:56.798 --> 16:58.756
Let me hold... You want
me to hold him? Okay.

17:03.587 --> 17:06.329
And that's what you get
for messing with your mama!

17:06.373 --> 17:07.896
You better ask somebody!

17:10.246 --> 17:12.379
So you knew, huh?

17:12.422 --> 17:14.816
Hell yeah, I knew!

17:14.859 --> 17:17.210
I heard you two talking
when I was in the kitchen.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.429
Um, how much did you hear?

17:19.473 --> 17:22.345
Mmm, about this much!Aah!

17:23.477 --> 17:26.175
Selling out your own
mother for a Laker ticket?

17:26.219 --> 17:28.482
You're an even bigger
snake than this one!

17:29.657 --> 17:31.267
Uh-oh,
where'd it go?

17:34.357 --> 17:36.098
Aw, hell no!

17:36.142 --> 17:38.274
I'm moving!
I'm moving!Go!

17:42.148 --> 17:45.281
Mom, Mom, you should've seen it!
I made the game-winning play!

17:45.325 --> 17:47.457
You scored a basket?

17:47.501 --> 17:50.721
No, I would have had to touch
the ball to do that.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.987
Oh, so you fouled another kid.

17:56.031 --> 17:58.120
Oh, no. He
didn't have to.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.730
The best player
on their team

17:59.774 --> 18:01.297
was about to score
the game-winning shot,

18:01.341 --> 18:02.994
but then, when
he saw Grover,

18:03.038 --> 18:05.432
he threw up an airball
and peed himself!

18:07.651 --> 18:10.001
Hey, come on, buddy.
Let's go inside.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.786
You should probably shower,
and, uh,

18:11.829 --> 18:14.180
I should probably
call an attorney.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.141
Well, Calvin,
congratulations.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.534
You turned my son into a monster

18:20.577 --> 18:23.014
just so you could win
a stupid basketball game.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.146
I hope you're happy.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.714
When you say it like that,

18:26.757 --> 18:28.150
it sounds like
I'm not supposed to be.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.283
Oh!

18:30.326 --> 18:32.067
You're unbelievable.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.286
Look, Gemma.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.157
You said that he had to play.

18:35.201 --> 18:37.159
Well, this is the only way
that he could do it

18:37.203 --> 18:38.726
without embarrassing himself.

18:38.769 --> 18:40.597
Oh, really?

18:40.641 --> 18:42.121
So this was just
about protecting him

18:42.164 --> 18:44.645
and not your precious
winning streak?

18:44.688 --> 18:46.125
Why can't it be both?

18:49.302 --> 18:50.738
Calvin, this was
supposed to be

18:50.781 --> 18:54.611
about teaching Grover
the value of being on a team.

18:54.655 --> 18:56.178
I trusted you.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.745
Think about it.

18:57.788 --> 19:01.444
If Grover would've went out
there and played terrible,

19:01.488 --> 19:05.535
and we lost, all the other kids
would have blamed him.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.885
And then he would never
want to be on a team again.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.191
Is that
what you want?

19:09.235 --> 19:11.280
Well, obviously not.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.413
But I also don't want kids
wetting their pants

19:13.456 --> 19:14.588
when he walks into a room.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.200
Look, I was just trying

19:18.244 --> 19:19.810
to give him
a role on the team

19:19.854 --> 19:21.508
where he could feel good
about himself.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.771
Yeah, but there's nothing
to feel good about

19:23.814 --> 19:27.209
if he's not playing
the right way.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.994
All right. Okay.

19:30.038 --> 19:32.214
I hear you.

19:32.258 --> 19:36.000
Maybe I took it
a little too far.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.219
I apologize.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.742
Thank you.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.135
But you got
to admit,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.616
he was having a good time
out there.

19:42.659 --> 19:46.141
He did have a pretty
big smile on his face.Yeah.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.275
So I guess I have to
give you credit for that.

19:49.318 --> 19:52.843
Well, you don't vote yourself
best coach in California

19:52.887 --> 19:54.410
for nothing.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.806
I'll tell you what,
I'll keep working with Grover

19:58.849 --> 20:01.417
on his fundamentals,
bring him up to speed.

20:01.461 --> 20:02.897
Thank you.

20:02.940 --> 20:06.248
And promise me, next
game, no more fouling.

20:06.292 --> 20:07.684
Not a problem.

20:07.728 --> 20:10.296
You don't have to worry
about that at all.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.298
He's been suspended
for the rest of the season.

20:18.608 --> 20:20.306
Hey, Calvin...

20:22.395 --> 20:25.267
I just hit 12 minutes.
Personal best.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.488
I've been watching
for five seconds.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.141
Personal worst.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.231
All right, come on.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.710
Why don't you
give it a try?

20:33.754 --> 20:35.582
Absolutely not.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.062
Calvin, you have
the wrong attitude.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.151
It's stop making fun ofit

20:40.195 --> 20:41.414
and start making fun

20:41.457 --> 20:43.764
a-withit.

20:45.418 --> 20:49.335
Fine.
I'll give it a spin.

20:52.425 --> 20:53.774
Hey, man!

20:54.862 --> 20:56.342
Huh.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.605
That was more fun
than I thought.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.650
Snake!
