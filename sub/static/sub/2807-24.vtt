00:02.157 --> 00:03.616
Previously on Friends:

00:03.783 --> 00:05.994
Seventeen hours, I have been at this.

00:06.161 --> 00:08.329
- How many centimeters am I dilated?
- Three.

00:08.538 --> 00:12.000
Just three? I'm dilated three.

00:13.042 --> 00:16.379
- We've talk about having babies someday.
- So we're gonna try?

00:16.588 --> 00:19.883
- Right here?
- No, not here.

00:20.049 --> 00:22.343
Maybe here.

00:22.510 --> 00:24.262
This is your grandmother's
engagement ring.

00:24.429 --> 00:26.222
I want you to give it to Rachel.

00:26.389 --> 00:28.766
- Mom, no.
- Ross, this isn't just some girl...

00:28.933 --> 00:33.021
...you picked up in a bar and humped.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.649
- Hey, I take it you're visiting someone?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

00:36.816 --> 00:39.068
- Wanna visit someone else?
- Yeah, I would like that.

00:40.403 --> 00:42.363
- That's him.
- Great. Well, go get him.

00:42.530 --> 00:44.282
Or maybe you could go in first.

00:44.449 --> 00:48.244
Hi, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions.

00:48.411 --> 00:50.872
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

00:52.123 --> 00:56.753
Oh, my God.

01:07.013 --> 01:10.808
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty,
private room right next door to hers?

01:11.851 --> 01:15.104
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

01:16.439 --> 01:19.484
Well, let me think about that.
While I remove my pants.

01:22.028 --> 01:25.365
Okay, mister. Fertilize me.

01:36.834 --> 01:39.546
Does that sound like Janice?

01:39.712 --> 01:42.632
If it's not, then there's two of them.

01:42.799 --> 01:45.051
And that would mean
it's the end of the world.

02:26.634 --> 02:27.677
H93'-

02:27.844 --> 02:29.053
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:29.220 --> 02:32.098
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you doing?

02:32.265 --> 02:34.267
Oh, not bad. You know that feeling...

02:34.434 --> 02:37.478
...when you're trying to blow
a Saint Bernard out your ass?

02:40.565 --> 02:42.317
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

02:43.901 --> 02:45.987
Mother of God, it's true.

02:46.904 --> 02:50.908
Chandler Bing.

02:51.075 --> 02:52.076
Janice.

02:52.243 --> 02:56.789
Notjust Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

02:58.249 --> 03:01.586
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

03:01.753 --> 03:03.796
You remember, Chandler.

03:07.258 --> 03:09.010
Janice, I didn't know you were pregnant.

03:09.177 --> 03:13.473
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

03:15.516 --> 03:17.310
It's you.

03:17.810 --> 03:19.604
This is yours.

03:20.146 --> 03:21.397
What?

03:21.564 --> 03:25.234
Ha, look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

03:28.905 --> 03:31.699
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

03:34.911 --> 03:38.748
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you rather eat?

03:38.915 --> 03:42.460
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

03:45.755 --> 03:49.175
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

03:49.342 --> 03:53.763
Because at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

03:54.514 --> 03:58.017
- Oh. Somebody went to college.
- Yeah.

03:58.184 --> 04:00.436
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

04:00.603 --> 04:03.523
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just my foot itches like crazy.

04:03.690 --> 04:06.150
On. I'll get it.

04:07.735 --> 04:11.572
Wow. I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

04:12.907 --> 04:15.493
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

04:18.204 --> 04:21.290
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

04:22.542 --> 04:28.214
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies...

04:28.381 --> 04:30.800
...and I have had no babies.

04:30.967 --> 04:32.969
Why doesn't she want to come out?

04:34.011 --> 04:35.638
You know what I think it is?

04:35.805 --> 04:38.099
I think you made such a nice
home for her...

04:38.266 --> 04:41.394
...over the last nine months
that she just doesn't want to leave.

04:41.561 --> 04:46.733
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me.

04:48.693 --> 04:51.821
- Oh, God. Ooh, ooh...
- Okay. Okay.

04:51.988 --> 04:54.657
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

04:54.824 --> 04:57.285
Doctor, you gotta do something.
You gotta give me drugs...

04:57.452 --> 05:00.913
...or you gotta light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out.

05:02.957 --> 05:05.960
Actually, I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

05:07.044 --> 05:08.838
- What?
- Ten centimeters.

05:09.547 --> 05:10.840
You're about to become a mom.

05:12.341 --> 05:15.219
Oh, my God. Okay.

05:15.386 --> 05:20.224
Ha-ha-ha, beat you, sucker. Oh, baby.

05:26.439 --> 05:31.152
Oh, my God. That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

05:32.320 --> 05:35.782
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

05:37.825 --> 05:41.037
I'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here...

05:41.204 --> 05:44.832
...in my room,
asking me all these weird questions.

05:44.999 --> 05:48.961
Cliff, do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here in your room?

05:49.420 --> 05:51.047
Rachel's having her baby.

05:54.008 --> 05:56.302
That's him. You know him?

05:57.011 --> 06:00.765
Okay. Okay. I... Okay. Um... This...

06:00.932 --> 06:04.852
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

06:05.019 --> 06:08.981
Um, if it, you know...
If it helps, you came off great.

06:09.148 --> 06:11.734
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

06:13.069 --> 06:17.114
I don't believe this. You got him
to pretend he was some fake doctor?

06:17.281 --> 06:20.827
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

06:21.953 --> 06:24.205
And then you tried
to make me think that I was crazy?

06:24.372 --> 06:27.959
You're right, that was wrong.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

06:28.125 --> 06:31.754
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

06:32.588 --> 06:33.756
I don't think so.

06:34.090 --> 06:35.800
Uh, if I may?

06:35.967 --> 06:39.136
Look, Cliff, you told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

06:39.303 --> 06:43.224
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

06:43.432 --> 06:47.895
Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer.

06:48.062 --> 06:52.358
Uh, she gave birth
to her brother's triplets.

06:54.193 --> 06:58.990
Oh, oh, oh.
Her twin sister used to do porn.

06:59.866 --> 07:03.244
- Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
- Right.

07:04.036 --> 07:05.329
Um...

07:06.289 --> 07:10.543
Look, we don't really know each other,
so it'd be really easy to just forget this...

07:10.877 --> 07:14.213
...but there seems to be something
between us. And I don't know about you...

07:14.380 --> 07:16.632
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

07:19.051 --> 07:22.763
- It doesn't happen to me, either.
- Me, neither.

07:25.725 --> 07:28.269
- Push.Push.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh...

07:28.436 --> 07:30.313
We're gonna push for five more seconds.

07:30.479 --> 07:32.189
Five, four...

07:32.356 --> 07:34.358
Three, two, one. Oh!

07:35.651 --> 07:38.863
Okay, the next contraction
should be in about 20 seconds.

07:39.030 --> 07:41.824
- I can't. I can't push anymore.
- Sweetie, you're doing great.

07:41.991 --> 07:45.202
Oh, God. Twenty seconds, my ass!

07:45.369 --> 07:47.788
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

07:47.955 --> 07:49.832
- Come on.
- Push. Wait.

07:49.999 --> 07:53.669
- I see something.
- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God.

07:53.836 --> 07:55.880
Don't say "Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God," what?

07:56.047 --> 07:57.089
What is that?

07:57.256 --> 07:59.759
That's the baby's buttocks. She's breech.

07:59.926 --> 08:02.929
- Oh, my God. I thought she had two heads.
- Oh, God.

08:04.305 --> 08:05.556
Is she gonna be okay?

08:05.723 --> 08:07.099
- She's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

08:07.266 --> 08:10.519
She's in a more difficult position,
so you're gonna have to push harder.

08:10.686 --> 08:13.022
- Okay.
- Go. Come on. Go. Go.

08:13.189 --> 08:15.107
Rachel,
you're gonna have to push harder.

08:15.274 --> 08:19.528
- I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

08:19.695 --> 08:21.197
- Let's go.
- I can't do it.

08:21.364 --> 08:24.408
- No, please, you do it for me.
No...

08:24.575 --> 08:30.748
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

08:31.791 --> 08:33.668
Good.

08:33.876 --> 08:35.169
Keep pushing.

08:36.962 --> 08:39.340
Are you okay?

08:41.133 --> 08:44.971
You have no idea how much this hurts.

08:46.806 --> 08:49.308
Keep going! Keep going!

08:50.476 --> 08:52.144
Here we go.

08:52.311 --> 08:54.981
Oh, oh! She's upside down,
but she's coming. She's coming.

08:55.147 --> 08:57.733
- Oh, God!
- Oh. Oh, my God.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.319
Oh, my God, she's here.

09:03.864 --> 09:06.075
Oh, she's perfect.

09:06.242 --> 09:10.913
Oh, wow. Oh, she's so tiny.

09:15.459 --> 09:19.588
- Where'd she go?
- They're just wrapping her up.

09:19.755 --> 09:23.300
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

09:25.761 --> 09:27.430
Here she is.

09:36.397 --> 09:37.857
Oh, you.

09:38.566 --> 09:41.819
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

09:44.155 --> 09:47.241
I know. Oh.

09:47.575 --> 09:49.368
Yes. Oh.

09:51.495 --> 09:57.126
Oh, she's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

09:57.918 --> 10:00.713
- Do we have a name yet?
- No, not yet.

10:00.880 --> 10:04.633
That's fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Green.

10:04.800 --> 10:08.012
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Green.

10:24.987 --> 10:27.656
Hello, Baby Girl.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.624
- Can we come in?
- Oh, come on in.

10:36.791 --> 10:40.336
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

10:40.503 --> 10:41.962
Here.

10:42.588 --> 10:47.176
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

10:48.427 --> 10:51.931
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

10:53.474 --> 10:56.477
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you...

10:56.644 --> 10:59.355
...and then 47 hours later, here she is.

11:05.778 --> 11:07.530
She looks so real.

11:09.824 --> 11:11.367
You know what I mean.

11:11.534 --> 11:14.370
- Okay, my turn. My turn.
- Aunt Phoebe.

11:14.537 --> 11:19.291
Yes. Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute.

11:19.458 --> 11:23.003
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

11:24.672 --> 11:26.549
I won't.

11:27.216 --> 11:32.221
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Sorry, I just can't stop crying.

11:32.388 --> 11:34.723
The doctor said it's completely normal,
with the hormones...

11:34.890 --> 11:38.644
- ...plus you're sleep-deprived.
- So? You guys are all sleep-deprived.

11:38.811 --> 11:43.190
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

11:44.233 --> 11:46.026
Oh, God.

11:46.193 --> 11:49.321
- What's the matter now?
- I was reliving it.

11:49.989 --> 11:51.532
Oh.

11:51.699 --> 11:53.993
So do you know
what you're gonna call her yet?

11:54.160 --> 11:57.246
Oh. Wait a minute,
it's not gonna be Baby Girl?

11:57.413 --> 11:59.123
I thought that was so original.

12:01.083 --> 12:03.919
Uh, actually,
we've narrowed it down to two names.

12:04.086 --> 12:06.088
Yeah, and you know what?
I love them both.

12:06.255 --> 12:09.425
So why don't you just pick one,
and that'll be it.

12:10.176 --> 12:15.931
Wow, um, okay. Uh, everyone?

12:16.098 --> 12:18.976
This is Isabella.

12:20.144 --> 12:22.897
- Hi, Isabella.
- Hi.

12:27.610 --> 12:31.447
- What?
- That's not her name.

12:31.614 --> 12:34.783
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

12:34.950 --> 12:37.411
- What was the other one, Ross?
- Um, Delilah.

12:37.578 --> 12:41.790
Oh, great. Suddenly she
sounds like a biblical whore.

12:44.919 --> 12:49.215
- Ahem, so I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
- Yay.

12:50.674 --> 12:51.967
What are we gonna do?

12:52.134 --> 12:55.179
- It's okay, honey. You'll find a name.
- Ugh. Easy for you to say.

12:55.346 --> 12:57.848
You already know
what your kids' names are gonna be.

12:58.015 --> 13:02.436
- You do?
- Yeah. I had them picked out since I was 14.

13:02.603 --> 13:07.024
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

13:10.569 --> 13:15.950
- Well, tell us, what are they?
- Um, okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

13:16.116 --> 13:19.453
- And if it's a girl?
- I don't want to say.

13:19.620 --> 13:22.790
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

13:23.916 --> 13:26.460
Okay. It's Emma.

13:27.795 --> 13:29.672
Emma.

13:33.509 --> 13:35.928
See, I don't want it.

13:40.766 --> 13:43.894
- Take it.
- What?

13:44.395 --> 13:46.438
She's clearly an Emma.

13:46.605 --> 13:48.816
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

13:49.817 --> 13:51.986
Yeah. But I love you more.

13:53.362 --> 13:54.905
Oh.

13:55.072 --> 13:59.410
Besides, you know, nothing goes
with Bing. So I'm screwed.

14:03.706 --> 14:05.040
Yoo-hoo.

14:05.207 --> 14:11.130
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

14:11.297 --> 14:12.881
Oh.

14:19.596 --> 14:23.142
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

14:23.309 --> 14:25.227
He's a keeper. Ha, ha.

14:26.603 --> 14:30.607
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, you know, I'm fine.

14:32.192 --> 14:35.571
Can I just say,
I really admire what you're doing.

14:35.738 --> 14:37.906
Just raising her all alone.

14:38.824 --> 14:41.035
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

14:41.243 --> 14:43.912
Oh, sure. Now.

14:44.079 --> 14:46.707
But what happens when he meets
somebody else and gets married?

14:47.458 --> 14:50.627
Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.

14:53.547 --> 14:56.383
I'm telling you, Rachel. Listen to Janice.

14:56.550 --> 15:01.972
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

15:03.390 --> 15:06.352
That's never gonna happen with Ross.

15:06.518 --> 15:08.395
That's what I thought
about my first husband.

15:08.562 --> 15:11.523
Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
the weekend with her father...

15:11.690 --> 15:12.983
...and little Miss New-Boobs.

15:14.943 --> 15:16.904
Really?

15:17.613 --> 15:19.490
I hate to be the one to say it...

15:19.656 --> 15:23.702
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

15:26.246 --> 15:29.375
Well, that's, you know, that's...

15:29.541 --> 15:32.878
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

15:34.838 --> 15:36.840
You know what?
Maybe we won't be alone.

15:37.007 --> 15:39.718
Because lately things
have been happening...

15:39.885 --> 15:41.387
...between me and Ross, you know?

15:41.553 --> 15:46.975
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

15:47.142 --> 15:51.730
So it might be the beginning
of something.

15:53.482 --> 15:55.275
- Hey, Janice.
- Oh, hi.

15:55.442 --> 15:59.696
Oh. Who's this little guy?

16:00.864 --> 16:05.327
- Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
- Oh, no, no. Ha, ha.

16:05.911 --> 16:09.164
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.
- Okay.

16:10.624 --> 16:15.129
- Man, you see the kid on that nose?
- Uh-huh.

16:17.214 --> 16:20.008
- You know what I was thinking about?
- Huh?

16:21.176 --> 16:25.931
Um, that kiss before we left
the apartment.

16:26.098 --> 16:28.267
That was something, huh?

16:29.560 --> 16:32.438
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

16:32.604 --> 16:35.315
But we, we gotta be careful. Heh.

16:35.482 --> 16:38.777
We... You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

16:41.572 --> 16:42.948
Right.

16:43.615 --> 16:45.367
We don't want to go down that road,
do we?

16:45.534 --> 16:49.705
No. No, of course not.
No, that's why I brought it up.

16:53.750 --> 16:57.629
- They didn't have any sodas?
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

16:57.796 --> 17:00.632
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

17:03.302 --> 17:05.596
And so it begins.

17:12.935 --> 17:14.188
She in there?

17:14.563 --> 17:16.898
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

17:17.065 --> 17:18.066
Oh.

17:18.233 --> 17:21.737
- Look at Emma.
- I can't decide who she looks more like.

17:21.904 --> 17:23.155
You or Rachel?

17:23.321 --> 17:27.075
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous. It's all Rachel.

17:31.497 --> 17:36.084
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

17:37.544 --> 17:40.714
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

17:40.881 --> 17:44.009
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

17:44.176 --> 17:47.513
It's complicated, okay?

17:48.639 --> 17:51.934
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, you love her, you always have...

17:52.100 --> 17:55.437
...you have a child together.
There's no right answer.

17:57.272 --> 18:00.025
Look, we've been together.
Okay, and then apart.

18:00.192 --> 18:02.319
And then together, and then apart.

18:02.486 --> 18:04.738
And now we have a baby.

18:07.658 --> 18:11.995
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

18:12.996 --> 18:15.624
I could never do that to Emma.

18:18.043 --> 18:23.507
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything... Now me.

18:23.674 --> 18:27.302
What, do they put something
in the water in this place?

18:28.220 --> 18:31.807
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

18:31.974 --> 18:33.809
I know, I know, I know.

18:33.976 --> 18:36.019
If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

18:36.186 --> 18:38.397
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right.

18:40.899 --> 18:44.778
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

18:53.370 --> 18:54.913
H93'-

18:55.581 --> 18:59.126
I just saw a woman breastfeeding
both of her twins at the same time.

18:59.293 --> 19:01.628
It is like a freak show up here.

19:02.713 --> 19:04.715
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

19:04.881 --> 19:06.675
What is it? Hey?

19:06.842 --> 19:09.970
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...
- Rach, come on. What?

19:11.722 --> 19:17.102
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

19:17.269 --> 19:20.147
What are you talking about: "alone"?
What about Ross?

19:20.314 --> 19:25.485
Oh, please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New-Boobs.

19:26.695 --> 19:29.281
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

19:30.490 --> 19:33.118
I'm just saying that, you know...

19:33.327 --> 19:36.538
...someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody...

19:36.705 --> 19:39.082
...and he's gonna have his own life.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.001
Right?

19:41.877 --> 19:43.754
Yeah, I guess so.

19:46.465 --> 19:50.218
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

19:51.762 --> 19:53.347
Pretty dumb, huh?

19:53.513 --> 19:56.266
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

19:56.808 --> 20:01.104
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

20:01.271 --> 20:05.150
Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.

20:07.027 --> 20:11.406
Oh, Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

20:12.949 --> 20:16.536
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

20:20.957 --> 20:23.585
Oh, honey, could you grab me
my other box of tissues?

20:23.752 --> 20:25.504
They're right on that chair
under Ross' coat.

20:25.671 --> 20:26.963
Sure.

20:35.555 --> 20:37.432
Oh, my God.

20:38.975 --> 20:40.018
Joey?

20:43.105 --> 20:44.981
Oh, my God.

20:50.862 --> 20:52.072
Okay.

21:27.733 --> 21:30.527
- That was amazing.
- I know.

21:32.529 --> 21:38.368
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

21:38.535 --> 21:40.120
We may have started our family.

21:40.579 --> 21:42.581
Nine months from now,
we could be here...

21:42.748 --> 21:44.916
...having our own baby.

21:45.625 --> 21:48.336
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
