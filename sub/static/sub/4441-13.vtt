00:10.901 --> 00:13.050
I don't know, it's not exactly formal.

00:13.457 --> 00:14.542
It's my backyard.

00:14.609 --> 00:16.579
And you're sure
Jenna's okay with me coming?

00:16.647 --> 00:19.315
Amanda, you're my girlfriend.

00:19.383 --> 00:20.818
Oh, so you're already telling people

00:20.885 --> 00:23.089
we're back together again.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.096
Yep. People know.

00:35.276 --> 00:36.905
Hey, Ryan,

00:36.973 --> 00:39.475
could you remind the deejay
about the couples' toast?

00:39.542 --> 00:40.742
Couples' toast?

00:40.810 --> 00:42.410
It's kind of a family tradition.

00:42.478 --> 00:44.445
After Drew and I have our first dance,

00:44.513 --> 00:45.880
all the couples hold hands,

00:45.948 --> 00:47.515
raise 'em high and yell
"Happiness!"

00:47.583 --> 00:50.220
Looks like Mommy's getting
shitfaced tonight.

00:50.288 --> 00:51.822
Yes, she is.

00:51.890 --> 00:53.391
No, no, no!

00:53.458 --> 00:55.828
We cannot sit cousin Ed next
to the Barishes!

00:55.896 --> 00:57.997
Legally. The Barishes
have a young son!

00:58.065 --> 00:59.465
These are all wrong!

00:59.533 --> 01:00.700
Wilfy! Wilfy!
Wilfred!

01:00.768 --> 01:01.568
Don't touch me!

01:01.635 --> 01:03.202
Ah!
Sorry.

01:03.270 --> 01:05.069
I asked Drew to clip his nails,

01:05.138 --> 01:06.773
but I guess
he didn't get around to it.

01:06.841 --> 01:08.809
Would you mind? I don't want him
scratching anyone else.

01:08.876 --> 01:10.344
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:10.411 --> 01:12.013
Please? He's really skittish

01:12.081 --> 01:13.381
and you're the only person
he'll trust.

01:17.254 --> 01:18.789
Ow!

01:18.857 --> 01:20.057
I didn't even clip it yet.

01:20.125 --> 01:21.826
You were going to.

01:21.894 --> 01:23.795
Yeah, well, that's what
we're doing here.

01:23.863 --> 01:26.298
What's wrong, Wilfred?

01:26.366 --> 01:28.101
Is there something
you're not telling me?

01:28.168 --> 01:29.736
I don't know, Ryan.

01:29.803 --> 01:31.738
Is there something
you're not telling me?

01:33.809 --> 01:35.076
You know, don't you?

01:35.144 --> 01:37.212
You're damn right I know.

01:37.279 --> 01:39.047
When were you planning on

01:39.115 --> 01:40.516
letting me in on this little secret?

01:40.584 --> 01:41.684
This changes everything.

01:41.752 --> 01:43.019
Ow!

01:43.087 --> 01:45.288
I'm not even holding the clippers.

01:45.356 --> 01:50.962
Look, Wilfred, I love Amanda,
and she loves me.

01:51.030 --> 01:54.300
I haven't told her about you and...

01:54.367 --> 01:56.035
everything else yet, but I'm going to.

01:56.103 --> 01:57.503
I'm just working up to it.

01:57.571 --> 01:59.706
Wait. You and Amanda
are back together?

01:59.774 --> 02:01.508
So, you didn't know?

02:01.576 --> 02:03.010
How would I?
I haven't seen Amanda

02:03.078 --> 02:04.679
since the day you two broke up.

02:04.747 --> 02:06.214
Well, then what the hell is going on?

02:06.282 --> 02:08.750
That's funny...

02:08.818 --> 02:12.021
because I would like to ask
you the same question.

02:14.659 --> 02:16.526
OH, it's just a drawing I did
when I was a kid.

02:16.594 --> 02:18.896
So that's your family?

02:18.964 --> 02:20.264
Yeah.

02:20.332 --> 02:22.934
Who's the dog?

02:23.002 --> 02:24.402
That's Sneakers.

02:24.470 --> 02:26.772
Not that dog.

02:26.839 --> 02:29.007
This dog.

02:32.513 --> 02:34.614
I-I, I don't know.

02:34.682 --> 02:36.115
Where'd you get this?

02:36.183 --> 02:39.919
I found it in
your childhood scrapbook.

02:39.987 --> 02:41.288
Well, that's impossible.

02:41.355 --> 02:43.256
You just said it was your drawing.

02:43.324 --> 02:44.991
Well, I guess I was wrong.

02:45.059 --> 02:47.461
Ryan, I'm only seven years old.

02:47.528 --> 02:49.095
This picture's at least 20.

02:50.932 --> 02:52.732
What aren't you telling me?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.901
I have to get ready for the wedding.

02:54.969 --> 02:56.736
I don't have time for these games.

02:56.804 --> 02:58.838
This isn't a game.
I need answers, Ryan!

02:58.906 --> 03:01.274
Who am I?!

03:01.341 --> 03:03.843
What am I?

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.753 --> 03:15.088
Okay, you want to know the truth?

03:18.159 --> 03:22.830
I've never seen
that drawing before, but...

03:22.897 --> 03:24.465
I do know about The Plan.

03:24.532 --> 03:27.101
The plan?

03:27.169 --> 03:29.370
You don't know?

03:29.438 --> 03:32.507
No, no, no, of course I know
about The Plan.

03:32.575 --> 03:36.645
Oh, my God...

03:36.713 --> 03:38.614
you really don't know, do you?

03:38.682 --> 03:42.619
Ryan... please?

03:44.255 --> 03:47.457
This has all happened before.

03:47.525 --> 03:51.062
You're not the first
"Wilfred," Wilfred.

03:51.129 --> 03:53.364
There have been hundreds.

03:53.432 --> 03:54.866
Maybe thousands.

03:54.933 --> 04:00.272
Every time you die,
you get resurrected.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.044
I guess I always thought

04:05.111 --> 04:07.346
there was something different
about me.

04:07.414 --> 04:10.082
Something special.

04:10.150 --> 04:12.551
I didn't know what.

04:12.619 --> 04:14.586
Because you weren't supposed to.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.955
None of you were.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.659
What is my... our purpose?

04:19.726 --> 04:23.662
No one knows for sure.

04:23.730 --> 04:28.301
The prophecy says
that all will be revealed

04:28.368 --> 04:30.370
by the final five Cylons.

04:30.437 --> 04:34.074
Cylons?

04:34.141 --> 04:35.508
<i>Battlestar Galactica!</i>

04:35.576 --> 04:37.210
What'd you think of the ending?

04:37.278 --> 04:39.079
Frak you, Ryan!

04:39.147 --> 04:40.481
Come on, Wilfred, admit it.

04:40.549 --> 04:42.650
You drew that picture.

04:42.718 --> 04:44.018
I don't know what you're up to,

04:44.086 --> 04:45.319
but I'm not falling for it.

04:45.387 --> 04:46.788
I did not draw that picture!

04:46.855 --> 04:48.723
Well, I don't believe you.

04:48.791 --> 04:50.963
Well, I don't believe <i>you!</i>

04:51.893 --> 04:53.694
Wilfred, your nails.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.949
Hey.
Hey!

05:09.017 --> 05:10.701
You look incredible.

05:10.821 --> 05:11.886
Thanks.

05:11.953 --> 05:14.988
You <i>will</i> look amazing once I fix this.

05:15.056 --> 05:17.558
The wedding party is assembling, Ryan.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.792
Wilfred, hi!

05:21.100 --> 05:24.002
Sorry, I guess all these
people are making him nervous.

05:24.070 --> 05:27.306
That's all right. He was really
sweet with me the other day.

05:27.374 --> 05:29.208
The other day?

05:29.275 --> 05:30.570
Wilfred saw you?

05:30.690 --> 05:33.445
Yeah, I was at Jenna and Drew's
dropping off a gift.

05:33.513 --> 05:35.848
They weren't home, but Wilfred
and I sat on the front porch

05:35.916 --> 05:37.049
for, like, ten minutes.

05:37.117 --> 05:38.288
It was so lovely.

05:38.408 --> 05:40.686
I think he's really happy
we're back together.

05:41.524 --> 05:43.488
Hmm.

05:44.837 --> 05:46.463
Stay two steps behind,

05:46.786 --> 05:49.488
and do not let my tail touch the ground.
Wilfred...

05:49.555 --> 05:52.023
If a single hair touches
a blade of that grass,

05:52.143 --> 05:53.492
I will cut your dick off.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.562
You think I don't have a
pair of dick shears? I do.

05:56.629 --> 05:59.865
Now smile, you lying bastard.

06:01.501 --> 06:03.168
You're the liar.

06:03.236 --> 06:05.370
You saw Amanda a few days ago.

06:05.438 --> 06:06.939
No, I didn't!

06:07.007 --> 06:10.042
Dennis, I'm so glad to see you!

06:10.110 --> 06:13.545
She told me.

06:13.613 --> 06:16.615
That's why you drew that
picture, so I'd think

06:16.683 --> 06:18.550
I was too crazy to be in
a relationship.

06:18.618 --> 06:20.752
You don't want me to be happy, do you?

06:20.820 --> 06:22.854
For that last time, I did
not draw that picture.

06:22.922 --> 06:24.222
Why would I do that?

06:24.290 --> 06:25.490
Why do you do anything?

06:25.558 --> 06:27.158
To mess with my head.

06:27.226 --> 06:28.927
You're trying to ruin
my life, aren't you?

06:28.995 --> 06:30.695
If I wanted to ruin your life, Ryan,

06:30.763 --> 06:32.030
I wouldn't do it with crayons.

06:32.098 --> 06:35.801
Goddamn it!
Wilfie, shh! Shh...

06:43.075 --> 06:44.509
Tony! Big T!

06:44.577 --> 06:45.910
Tony Baloney!

06:45.978 --> 06:48.914
That was not Tony.

06:48.981 --> 06:50.415
Hey.

06:50.483 --> 06:51.850
James?

06:51.918 --> 06:53.251
Hey, are you getting married today?

06:53.319 --> 06:54.553
Just hosting.
Oh.

06:54.621 --> 06:55.754
What are you doing here?

06:55.822 --> 06:58.357
Ah, it can wait.

06:59.659 --> 07:00.993
Actually, it can't.

07:02.295 --> 07:03.862
Is everything okay?

07:03.930 --> 07:05.831
It's about the guy you used
to work with,

07:05.899 --> 07:07.166
Kevin Ghesquire.

07:07.234 --> 07:08.801
You know your dad is
representing him, right?

07:08.869 --> 07:12.005
Yeah. I still can't believe
he sold our company secrets.

07:12.072 --> 07:13.373
He was framed.

07:13.441 --> 07:14.608
What?

07:14.675 --> 07:15.842
By who?

07:19.713 --> 07:22.015
James?

07:22.083 --> 07:25.152
Our investigators turned up
a wire transfer

07:25.219 --> 07:28.755
from Kanner-McKay
for $10.2 million

07:28.823 --> 07:31.559
into an offshore account...

07:31.626 --> 07:33.027
in your name.

07:33.095 --> 07:34.195
What?!

07:34.262 --> 07:35.496
James?
Hey.

07:35.564 --> 07:36.864
Oh, my God, I didn't know

07:36.932 --> 07:38.198
you were gonna be here.

07:40.068 --> 07:42.903
Oh!

07:42.971 --> 07:45.139
This is so great.
You can be my date.

07:45.207 --> 07:46.674
Here, hold my baby.
What? Huh?

07:46.742 --> 07:48.376
Yeah, get a feel for him.
What?

07:48.443 --> 07:49.677
I'm gonna get us some champagne.

07:49.744 --> 07:50.944
Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

07:51.012 --> 07:53.848
This is some kind of mistake.

07:53.915 --> 07:55.750
No, dude, this is not a mistake.

07:55.817 --> 07:57.251
Look, I know you would never do

07:57.319 --> 07:58.953
something like this,
and so does your dad.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.755
But by law, he has to hand over all

08:00.822 --> 08:03.557
information to the
authorities by tomorrow.

08:03.625 --> 08:05.859
You're gonna need
a really good lawyer, Ryan.

08:05.927 --> 08:07.427
Your dad wants to help.

08:07.495 --> 08:09.196
I didn't do this.
I didn't do anything!

08:09.264 --> 08:10.172
Well, somebody did.

08:10.292 --> 08:11.475
It's a setup!

08:11.595 --> 08:13.944
Someone is trying to ruin my life!

08:27.304 --> 08:30.176
Ryan!
I can't believe this! You framed me?

08:30.296 --> 08:33.087
Whoa, whoa, what the hell are
you talking about?

08:33.207 --> 08:34.775
You sold my company's secrets

08:34.842 --> 08:37.144
and put the money in
an offshore account in my name!

08:37.212 --> 08:38.578
They're gonna put me in jail!

08:38.647 --> 08:40.232
Company secrets?
Offshore accounts?

08:40.352 --> 08:41.856
I don't know how to do that stuff.

08:41.976 --> 08:43.270
Well, you knew how
to use my credit card

08:43.289 --> 08:44.473
to order your meat-
of-the-month club.

08:44.593 --> 08:47.920
That was Amazon.com, Ryan!
One-click shopping!

08:47.988 --> 08:48.985
They make it very easy!

08:49.114 --> 08:51.416
Why would you do this to me?
I didn't!

08:51.484 --> 08:53.451
Well, then who did?
And I swear to God,

08:53.519 --> 08:54.819
if you say the Postal Service...

08:54.887 --> 08:56.154
You think the Postal Service
gives a shit

08:56.222 --> 08:57.756
about a nobody like you?!

08:57.824 --> 09:00.860
They're too busy developing
heartworm-deploying flea-borgs.

09:00.927 --> 09:02.194
And delivering mail.

09:02.262 --> 09:02.995
So then who?

09:06.967 --> 09:08.167
Your father.

09:08.235 --> 09:09.135
What?

09:09.203 --> 09:10.637
He's been trying to get you back

09:10.705 --> 09:12.139
ever since you walked out on him.

09:12.207 --> 09:13.840
He offered you a job,
you knocked it back

09:13.908 --> 09:14.875
the next thing you know,

09:14.943 --> 09:16.143
the company you work for is destroyed.

09:16.211 --> 09:17.511
No, that's just a coincidence.

09:17.579 --> 09:19.180
Oh, really?

09:19.248 --> 09:21.015
How did you find out about
this offshore account?

09:21.083 --> 09:26.354
My dad represents the guy
accused of selling the formula.

09:26.422 --> 09:29.190
Well, isn't that convenient?

09:29.258 --> 09:31.426
Your father is the one who
discovers the evidence

09:31.494 --> 09:32.961
that links you to the crime.

09:33.028 --> 09:34.262
Suddenly, you need a lawyer.

09:34.330 --> 09:35.764
Suddenly, you need him.

09:35.831 --> 09:37.265
He wouldn't...

09:37.333 --> 09:39.101
Wouldn't what, Ryan?
Manipulate you?

09:39.168 --> 09:42.203
Do whatever it takes to get you
back under his control?

09:42.271 --> 09:43.772
It's brilliant.

09:43.839 --> 09:46.575
It's bullshit!
When I left my dad's firm,

09:46.642 --> 09:48.644
it caused a huge embarrassing
scandal for him.

09:48.711 --> 09:51.413
The last thing he wants from me
is more negative publicity.

09:51.481 --> 09:54.116
Nice try, Wilfred.
It was you!

09:54.184 --> 09:56.352
Christ, Ryan, think about it!

09:56.420 --> 09:58.889
Sending you to jail,
how would that benefit me?

09:58.956 --> 10:03.060
Without you, I have no purpose.
I'm nothing!

10:03.128 --> 10:05.829
It's like I don't even exist.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.731
I feel like I've heard that before.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.566
Because you know it's true.

10:11.603 --> 10:13.772
Ryan, there is someone else
to consider.

10:13.839 --> 10:16.508
Someone who's been
sabotaging you for years.

10:16.576 --> 10:18.543
Someone who even tried
to kill you once.

10:20.546 --> 10:21.647
Me?

10:23.182 --> 10:25.417
I would never... That's crazy!

10:25.485 --> 10:27.719
Interesting choice of words.

10:27.787 --> 10:29.555
Come on! I mean,
don't you think

10:29.623 --> 10:30.990
I'd remember doing something
like that?

10:32.926 --> 10:34.660
There's a lot you don't remember.

10:36.597 --> 10:39.732
I got to be honest with you, Ryan.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.534
I thought I was in control.

10:41.602 --> 10:44.004
I thought I was the
one calling the shots.

10:44.072 --> 10:47.608
But what if it was you all along?

10:47.676 --> 10:50.411
Why would I do this to myself?

10:50.479 --> 10:52.580
I don't know, mate.

10:52.648 --> 10:56.985
Maybe the person who doesn't
want you to be happy...

10:57.052 --> 10:58.586
is you.

11:11.134 --> 11:13.368
I thought I was getting better.

11:40.528 --> 11:41.895
Wait.

11:41.963 --> 11:43.730
You know, you don't
have to tell her now.

11:43.798 --> 11:45.498
She deserves to know.

11:50.438 --> 11:51.872
There you are.

11:51.939 --> 11:54.207
Sorry.
Uh, hosting stuff.

11:54.275 --> 11:56.843
Everyone please join
the bride and groom

11:56.911 --> 11:58.578
as they finish their
first dance together.

12:00.014 --> 12:01.314
You've done an amazing job.

12:01.382 --> 12:02.782
This wedding is beautiful.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.785
Amanda...

12:04.852 --> 12:05.919
I have to tell you something...

12:07.288 --> 12:09.089
I don't know how to say this.

12:09.157 --> 12:10.857
Ryan, you can tell me anything.

12:19.467 --> 12:22.035
Wilfred talks to me.

12:22.103 --> 12:23.737
And I talk to him.

12:23.804 --> 12:25.705
We talk to each other.

12:25.773 --> 12:27.073
Like, real talking.

12:27.141 --> 12:28.274
Full-on conversations.

12:29.643 --> 12:31.444
Is this some kind of joke?

12:31.511 --> 12:33.779
I-I wish it was.

12:33.847 --> 12:36.549
It's hard to explain.

12:36.616 --> 12:38.718
Everyone else sees a dog.

12:38.785 --> 12:40.453
But when I look at him,

12:40.520 --> 12:42.655
I see... something else.

12:44.691 --> 12:46.725
I've kept this a secret for so long.

12:46.793 --> 12:49.928
And I thought I could
handle it, but I can't,

12:49.996 --> 12:51.396
and-and I don't expect you to...

12:54.768 --> 12:57.236
Ryan...

12:57.304 --> 12:58.570
Wilfred talks to me, too.

13:02.242 --> 13:04.276
I thought I was the only one.

13:04.344 --> 13:06.778
Ever since that day you
brought him into the office.

13:06.846 --> 13:08.447
At first, I tried to ignore him,

13:08.514 --> 13:09.981
tried to pretend it wasn't happening.

13:10.049 --> 13:11.850
I was afraid I was losing my mind.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.652
I can't believe this.
Yeah.

13:13.719 --> 13:15.253
After a while, I finally realized

13:15.321 --> 13:16.954
that he was here for a reason.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.956
Ryan, there's so much
darkness inside of me

13:19.024 --> 13:21.493
that I don't let anyone see.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.394
But Wilfred, he...

13:23.462 --> 13:25.696
he seems to know everything about me,

13:25.764 --> 13:28.165
and I know it sounds crazy, but...

13:28.233 --> 13:29.733
he helps me.

13:29.801 --> 13:33.103
I... I thought I was
the only one, too.

13:33.171 --> 13:35.004
Ryan, don't you see?

13:35.072 --> 13:37.306
We're meant to be together.

13:37.374 --> 13:39.675
We don't have to be alone anymore.

13:39.743 --> 13:42.845
I just don't understand why
Wilfred never told me.

13:42.913 --> 13:45.314
He never mentioned it to me, either.

13:45.382 --> 13:46.949
Maybe it was a part of his plan.

13:47.017 --> 13:49.351
W... What plan?

13:49.419 --> 13:51.654
He told me about it
the day we broke up.

13:51.722 --> 13:53.923
He told you he has a plan?

13:53.991 --> 13:55.792
Yeah, I don't know
all of the details, but...

13:55.859 --> 13:57.760
you know Wilfred, he's so mysterious.

13:57.828 --> 13:59.528
He sure is.

13:59.596 --> 14:01.364
So, about his plan...

14:01.432 --> 14:03.032
I'll tell you all about it in Tahiti.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.268
Tahiti?

14:05.336 --> 14:06.502
Or Rio.

14:06.570 --> 14:08.738
I mean, wherever we want to go.

14:11.508 --> 14:14.877
I'm the one that sold
the formula, Ryan.

14:14.945 --> 14:16.745
$10.2 million.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.150
You did that?

14:21.218 --> 14:22.552
I did it for us.

14:25.763 --> 14:27.956
Now we can be together forever.

14:28.024 --> 14:29.491
Just like Wilfred promised.

14:45.198 --> 14:47.299
She said what?
She said you told her to sell the formula.

14:47.367 --> 14:48.826
Why didn't you tell me
you could talk to her?

14:48.827 --> 14:49.885
Because I can't.

14:50.005 --> 14:52.340
I'm a dog, Ryan.
I can't talk to people.

14:52.407 --> 14:54.409
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

14:56.412 --> 14:57.478
Come.

14:59.414 --> 15:01.449
Wilfred.
I told Ryan everything.

15:01.517 --> 15:03.084
I hope you're not mad at me.

15:03.151 --> 15:04.352
I don't know what she's talking about.

15:04.419 --> 15:06.620
Wilfred, come on!
He's so silly.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.456
Ryan, can she actually
hear what I'm...?

15:08.523 --> 15:10.825
Wilfred, stop.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.929
Ryan, I swear, there's
no way she can hear me!

15:14.997 --> 15:17.098
Amanda...

15:17.166 --> 15:18.901
what did Wilfred just say?

15:19.021 --> 15:21.719
Yeah, Amanda, if you can hear
me, tell me what I just said,

15:21.839 --> 15:23.543
you diseased bag of human garbage.

15:23.663 --> 15:26.093
He said that the little bride
and groom on top of the cake

15:26.213 --> 15:28.341
made him think of us.

15:32.195 --> 15:34.881
No, he didn't.

15:34.949 --> 15:36.757
I think that's what he said.

15:37.030 --> 15:38.822
Sometimes it's hard for me
to understand him

15:38.954 --> 15:40.288
with that French accent.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.357
Okay.

15:42.425 --> 15:43.792
I think we're done here.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.394
Amanda...

15:45.461 --> 15:46.862
you have to turn yourself in.

15:46.930 --> 15:48.130
What?

15:48.197 --> 15:49.832
No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:49.899 --> 15:51.567
When you broke up with me,

15:51.634 --> 15:53.302
you told me it was
because of your job.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.904
Well, now you never
have to work again.

15:54.971 --> 15:56.405
You framed Kevin.

15:56.473 --> 15:59.208
An innocent man went to jail.
Innocent?

15:59.276 --> 16:00.877
He stole the jalapeños off my bagel.

16:00.945 --> 16:02.145
Five times!

16:02.213 --> 16:04.281
Kevin was a great man.

16:04.349 --> 16:06.817
He gave me a belly rub
when nobody else would.

16:06.885 --> 16:08.652
A man died.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.755
Jeremy killed himself.

16:10.823 --> 16:12.957
I know. And I do feel
really bad about that.

16:13.025 --> 16:15.159
Are you ready for us

16:15.227 --> 16:16.927
to start our new life together?

16:20.732 --> 16:23.601
Yeah, let me just...

16:23.668 --> 16:25.936
say goodbye to some people.

16:32.577 --> 16:34.912
Woo!

16:36.748 --> 16:38.482
Great party, Ryan!

16:38.549 --> 16:40.283
Woo!

16:40.351 --> 16:42.318
I had dinner reservations,
like, 45 minutes ago.

16:42.386 --> 16:43.619
Sorry.

16:43.687 --> 16:46.155
Listen, I know who framed me.

16:46.223 --> 16:47.623
You do?

16:47.691 --> 16:48.891
Shit!

16:48.959 --> 16:51.793
All right, um, I'm...

16:51.861 --> 16:53.061
I'm your lawyer.

16:53.129 --> 16:54.997
Don't talk to anybody.

16:55.064 --> 16:57.833
I'm gonna call the FBI and we're
gonna get this sorted out, okay?

16:57.901 --> 16:59.334
Call a doctor, too.

16:59.402 --> 17:00.702
A psychiatrist.

17:03.807 --> 17:05.339
Excuse me.

17:05.407 --> 17:07.809
Can I have everyone's attention
over here, please?

17:07.877 --> 17:10.646
Drew and I would like to honor

17:10.714 --> 17:12.281
our incredible host, Ryan Newman.

17:12.348 --> 17:14.983
Ryan, we can't thank you enough.

17:15.050 --> 17:18.753
You truly have made today
the happiest day ever.

17:21.924 --> 17:23.759
Okay, single ladies.

17:23.826 --> 17:25.961
It's bouquet time!

17:34.203 --> 17:37.272
Ryan, it's all happening.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.074
Our life together is gonna be so...

17:39.142 --> 17:41.376
Wonderful.

17:44.748 --> 17:46.548
It's all gonna be wonderful.

17:57.528 --> 17:59.028
How's Amanda?

17:59.096 --> 18:02.498
She's being held for
psychiatric evaluation.

18:05.102 --> 18:07.236
She confessed to everything,
so I'm in the clear.

18:09.940 --> 18:11.607
I hope she gets
the help that she needs.

18:19.017 --> 18:20.818
If it makes you feel any better,

18:20.885 --> 18:24.555
I didn't see it coming either.

18:24.623 --> 18:27.525
And I'm usually good
at spotting the crazies.

18:30.063 --> 18:32.263
Like me?

18:32.331 --> 18:34.466
You're no crazier than anybody else.

18:34.533 --> 18:36.634
Said the dog to the man.

18:36.702 --> 18:38.937
You're not, Ryan.

18:39.005 --> 18:41.506
How can you say that?

18:41.574 --> 18:44.042
What's the difference
between me and Amanda?

18:44.110 --> 18:47.847
Some people can't handle Vegas.

18:47.914 --> 18:50.149
You can.

18:53.186 --> 18:54.687
What about that drawing?

18:54.755 --> 18:57.089
What about it?

18:57.157 --> 18:59.325
The only thing that's
given me comfort at all

18:59.393 --> 19:01.794
is that, deep down,

19:01.862 --> 19:04.531
I assumed you had all the answers.

19:04.598 --> 19:08.401
But if I really drew that
picture when I was a kid

19:08.469 --> 19:11.838
and you don't know what it means...

19:11.906 --> 19:14.541
Well...

19:14.609 --> 19:17.144
we're on a plane with no pilot.

19:18.613 --> 19:20.782
And that scares the shit out of me.

19:26.589 --> 19:29.258
I drew the picture, Ryan.

19:29.326 --> 19:32.128
I was just messing with your head,

19:32.196 --> 19:34.297
like I usually do.

19:34.364 --> 19:36.599
I guess I took it too far.

19:39.036 --> 19:41.103
Don't worry, mate.

19:41.171 --> 19:43.172
You're in good hands.

19:46.276 --> 19:48.544
Good night.
