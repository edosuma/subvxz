Very, very lovely.
You know what you get better and

27:21.203 --> 27:23.072
better.
Your harmonies get tighter.

27:23.072 --> 27:24.940

Ten acts fighting to win.
Next the turn of a young opera

28:25.778 --> 28:31.551
singer with a vis that hasoice that has the
the country talking.

28:31.551 --> 28:34.187
From Chicago, Illinois,
performing to win $1 million.

28:34.187 --> 28:40.260
Here is Laura bretan.
>> All of this began when I was

28:40.260 --> 28:43.725
4 years old.
I sang in church for the first

28:43.725 --> 28:45.365
4 years old.
I sang in church for the first

28:45.365 --> 28:51.170
time.
I feel like my voice comes from

28:51.170 --> 28:52.538
something bigger than me,
really.

28:52.538 --> 28:55.775
I don't know how to explain it.
When I sing I feel like I get

28:55.775 --> 28:58.411
lost in the music.
It is not like a scary lost.

28:58.411 --> 29:03.316
It's just, it feels like I know
that I'm in the right place.

29:03.316 --> 29:05.118
I don't know it is
undescribable.

29:13.293 --> 29:13.725
I'm so happy to know I am one of
the finalists and one of the top

29:13.725 --> 29:16.496
I'm so happy to know I am one of

Just about a year ago.

29:22.535 --> 29:28.107
I was a normal 8th grader.
And now I am in the finals of

29:28.107 --> 29:38.117
America's got talent.
I feel like this is a crazy

29:38.117 --> 29:41.187

And I am so not ready to wake up

32:13.725 --> 32:18.878
Simon, what would you look to
say to her?

32:18.878 --> 32:22.815
This is ridiculous.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.083

32:24.083 --> 32:26.352

classical music.

32:26.352 --> 32:31.157
What I do know is that we are
seeing somebody who is

32:31.157 --> 32:32.959
extraordinary, talented, really
sweet.

perform with such passion.

32:38.798 --> 32:41.901

You always hit that big moment.

32:41.901 --> 32:43.725
I'm sitting here thinking she
can't be 14.

32:43.725 --> 32:44.070
I'm sitting here thinking she
can't be 14.

32:44.070 --> 32:46.873
It can't really be you singing.
But it is.

32:46.873 --> 32:48.774

33:05.424 --> 33:07.727
dollar performance.
We have seen four.

33:07.727 --> 33:10.563
Can you throw in another $3
million?

33:10.563 --> 33:13.099
I will split it with
you.

33:13.099 --> 33:13.725
- The four of us will.
- There you go.

33:13.725 --> 33:17.270
- The four of us will.
- There you go.

33:17.270 --> 33:19.839
I did feel your nerves a
little bit.

33:19.839 --> 33:22.875
- She is 14.
- Every single note,

33:22.875 --> 33:28.114
Simon, you hit with such
accuracy, how do I say that

33:28.114 --> 33:29.649

- I love that you get

33:29.649 --> 33:33.653
- accuracy a little off.
- Yeah, oh, I just got

33:33.653 --> 33:34.987
that.
What a performance.

33:34.987 --> 33:38.357
What a perform ans.
And yes, how old are you?

33:38.357 --> 33:41.727

- Heidi.
- Simon, I swear to god.

33:45.765 --> 33:49.135

- You look like a

33:49.135 --> 33:50.203
princess.
But you rule the stage like a

In a couple minutes one of the
most mystifying acts we ever had

34:23.502 --> 34:26.906
takes the stage.
Can they blow your mind once

34:26.906 --> 34:27.907
again?
It is the clairvoyants right

34:27.907 --> 34:29.955
after this.

34:44.156 --> 34:46.859
Welcome back to the
finals on agt.

34:46.859 --> 34:49.262
The next act probably knows if
they already won.

34:49.262 --> 34:52.865
They seem to know anything else
about the show.

34:52.865 --> 34:54.867
Including what is deep in
people's mind.

34:54.867 --> 34:58.337
Tonight they have one last
performance to win $1 million.

34:58.337 --> 35:01.207
Brace yourselves for a journey
into the impossible.

35:01.207 --> 35:06.241
Here's the clairvoyants.

35:06.241 --> 35:08.514

35:08.514 --> 35:12.618
our lives forever.
>> When our paths crossed I felt

35:12.618 --> 35:19.358
a shiver running down my spine.
>> As we locked eyes ‐‐

35:19.358 --> 35:27.600
time stood still.
It felt as though we already

35:27.600 --> 35:29.935
knew each other.
At first our connection scared

35:29.935 --> 35:35.741
us.
The energy was almost too much

35:35.741 --> 35:36.241
to bear.
But over the years we learned

35:36.241 --> 35:44.917
to bear.
But over the years we learned

35:44.917 --> 35:52.358
how to control our connection.
We feel a connection, not only

35:52.358 --> 35:57.863
to each other, but to all
clairvoyants throughout history.

35:57.863 --> 36:00.333
>> It has all led to this
moment.

36:00.333 --> 36:04.203
And to the finals of "America's
got talent."

36:04.203 --> 36:06.241
Tonight, we will be using the
secrets of the ancients.

36:06.241 --> 36:08.174
Tonight, we will be using the
secrets of the ancients.

36:08.174 --> 36:19.919
And we will be stepping into our
destiny.

36:19.919 --> 36:21.721
America, thank you for voting us
to the finals of "America's got

36:21.721 --> 36:25.658

>> Hopefully we have saved the

36:25.658 --> 36:29.595
best for last.
>> You may think our final

36:29.595 --> 36:32.131
performance just started a
couple second ago.

36:32.131 --> 36:34.967
No.
It began four months ago when

36:34.967 --> 36:36.241
we, judges, met for the very
first time.

36:36.241 --> 36:37.269
We, judges, met for the very
first time.

36:37.269 --> 36:41.173
And from this moment on,
everything has been planned.

36:41.173 --> 36:43.275
Heidi, you remember the first
thing we did.

36:43.275 --> 36:47.913
You opened your handbag.
And she knew exactly what was

36:47.913 --> 36:49.615
- inside.
- Yes.

36:49.615 --> 36:52.651
>> Tonight it will be more
random.

36:52.651 --> 36:55.955
Blindfold yourself.
Heidi, throw the ball into the

36:55.955 --> 37:06.241
audience, wherever you like.
Side step.

37:06.241 --> 37:09.335
Audience, wherever you like.
Side step.

37:09.335 --> 37:10.536

37:10.536 --> 37:14.640

Okay.

37:14.640 --> 37:18.577
There is one object in my hands,
what is it?

37:18.577 --> 37:21.213
>> You can open this up.
There is something inside.

37:21.213 --> 37:23.916
Sense a wallet.
>> That is correct.

37:23.916 --> 37:26.385
>> He took something outside.
Driver's license.

37:26.385 --> 37:28.087

I'd thought you just made a huge

- Because I have never

58:53.612 --> 58:57.749

It made me laugh.

58:57.749 --> 59:00.585
Now, tape face, to be honest, I

Especially Mel with the toilet

Especially Mel with the toilet

Pretty hilarious.

What the bloody hell

59:17.836 --> 59:23.508

I think it was probably Mel's,

59:23.508 --> 59:27.245
probably one of her best
performances in her entire

59:27.245 --> 59:28.980

59:56.942 --> 1:00:01.746
two horses on a stick.
And you put Mel b in the toilet.

1:00:01.746 --> 1:00:05.650

It is a horse race.

1:00:05.650 --> 1:00:07.052

laughing out loud with just you

Why you had to get me involved,

1:00:28.873 --> 1:00:32.344
I have no idea.
I don't know what happened up

1:00:32.344 --> 1:00:34.913

1:00:36.448 --> 1:00:39.517
Assuming you did and you
delivered, again, something

1:00:39.517 --> 1:00:40.020

So, well done.

1:00:40.020 --> 1:00:41.753

age‐old skill and transforms it
into something stunning every

It is like the beginning of my

1:03:07.698 --> 1:03:09.800
transformation.
The character that I become

1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:12.102
represents the dreamer inside of
me.

1:03:12.102 --> 1:03:16.273
The same dreamer that I was when
I was 5 years old and I first

1:03:16.273 --> 1:03:20.811
discovered juggling.
It was a hard time during the

1:03:20.811 --> 1:03:23.080
years in Ukraine.
Lots of difficulties.

1:03:23.080 --> 1:03:26.947
The juggling studio was an
escape from that world.

1:03:26.947 --> 1:03:27.318
The juggling studio was an
escape from that world.

1:03:27.318 --> 1:03:32.690
After I left Ukraine to live in
America, the Soviet union

1:03:32.690 --> 1:03:34.425
collapsed.
The lack of funding forced the

1:03:34.425 --> 1:03:40.831
studio to shut down.
Awful my

1:03:40.831 --> 1:03:42.099
all of my childhood belonged to
that place.

1:03:42.099 --> 1:03:47.905
It just broke my heart.
In just a few years ago, I

1:03:47.905 --> 1:03:50.474
reopened the same juggling
studio.

1:03:50.474 --> 1:03:56.013
Now, the studio has life, almost
80 kids learning and discovering

1:03:56.013 --> 1:03:56.947
their talents.
Winning "America's got talent,"

1:03:56.947 --> 1:04:05.155
their talents.
Winning "America's got talent,"

1:04:05.155 --> 1:04:09.660
it is not just for me, it is for
every kid to inspire them to

1:04:09.660 --> 1:04:19.970
hold on to that little light of
hope and dream big.

1:06:56.593 --> 1:06:56.947

Wonderful job.

did?

1:07:11.875 --> 1:07:13.977
I'm not sure.
Kidding.

1:07:13.977 --> 1:07:19.650
Can I just say something, honest
to god this is the best show in

1:07:19.650 --> 1:07:21.485

Like watching a movie.

1:07:21.485 --> 1:07:23.787

You know, there is no other way

play, every performance, I am

1:11:34.372 --> 1:11:36.407
going to do it like it is my
last one.

1:11:36.407 --> 1:11:43.614
Better yet, I am going to do it
like it is my first and only.

1:11:43.614 --> 1:11:44.749
>> Yes!

1:11:44.749 --> 1:11:48.019
Yes!
Thank you!

1:11:48.686 --> 1:11:51.255
Thank you.
Thank you.

1:11:51.255 --> 1:11:53.091
All right.
Here's what I wanted to do.

1:11:53.091 --> 1:11:54.992
We are going to do a trick with
the twos.

1:11:54.992 --> 1:11:57.595
I love them.
You have a sharpee in front of

1:11:57.595 --> 1:11:57.830
you.
I want each to sign the twos.

1:11:57.830 --> 1:12:00.064
You.
I want each to sign the twos.

1:12:00.064 --> 1:12:02.667
Write your name.
Great way to get an autograph.

1:12:02.667 --> 1:12:06.237
Simon, if you do me a favor.
Write the name of somebody that

1:12:06.237 --> 1:12:08.139
meant a lot to you.
Nickname.

1:12:08.139 --> 1:12:10.074
Person.
Doesn't matter.

1:12:10.074 --> 1:12:12.076
Somebody important.
Yeah, yeah, on that card.

1:12:12.076 --> 1:12:14.378
Yep.
Howie, we got your two?

1:12:14.378 --> 1:12:16.547
Mel b., got yours?
Heidi, got yours?

1:12:16.547 --> 1:12:19.584
And Simon, we can all see it.
Yeah, it is okay.

1:12:19.584 --> 1:12:21.819
I have seen this trick.
Ha‐ha.

1:12:21.819 --> 1:12:25.790
You wrote the name Eric.
Who is Eric?

1:12:25.790 --> 1:12:27.830
My son.
>> I love this.

1:12:27.830 --> 1:12:28.926
My son.
>> I love this.

1:12:28.926 --> 1:12:30.828
Remember that.
Today I wanted to take an

1:12:30.828 --> 1:12:34.031
opportunity to tell America what
magic has meant to me.

1:12:34.031 --> 1:12:37.301
Magic saved my life.
And ‐‐ and there have been

1:12:37.301 --> 1:12:40.238
plenty of times where I was
lost.

1:12:40.238 --> 1:12:43.040
I didn't hatchve the answers.
I didn't know where to go.

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:45.076
What I did was I turned to
magic.

1:12:45.076 --> 1:12:50.047
It helped me find myself.
It simply taught me don't hate.

1:12:50.047 --> 1:12:54.552
don't blame.
And forgive.

1:12:54.552 --> 1:12:57.830
And with that, I think we can
all find ourselves.

1:12:57.830 --> 1:13:00.124
And with that, I think we can
all find ourselves.

1:13:00.124 --> 1:13:01.559
don't hate.
Imagine if we take all the hate

1:13:01.559 --> 1:13:05.196
out of our lives.
Howie, I believe we will find

1:13:05.196 --> 1:13:11.903
ourselves?
Mel b., may we all take the

1:13:11.903 --> 1:13:14.972
blame out and fill our hearts
with love.

1:13:14.972 --> 1:13:20.945
I believe, we will find
ourselves.

1:13:20.945 --> 1:13:26.083
Heidi, I have had a lot of
things hapt penthing

1:13:26.083 --> 1:13:27.830
s happen in life.
Forgiveness has given me

1:13:27.830 --> 1:13:29.320
s happen in life.
Forgiveness has given me

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:31.289
happiness.
May we all forgive a little

1:13:31.289 --> 1:13:32.990
more.
And we will find ourselves.

1:13:32.990 --> 1:13:37.929
>> Wow.
>> Simon, we're going to shuffle

1:13:37.929 --> 1:13:38.996
the card.
Face up.

1:13:38.996 --> 1:13:41.499
Face down.
And itch you think about it,

1:13:41.499 --> 1:13:45.503
this right here, this is life.
When everything is going so

1:13:45.503 --> 1:13:48.306
perfect, and yet tragedy and
chaos, they strike us when we

1:13:48.306 --> 1:13:50.942
least expect it.
And it is what we all have in

1:13:50.942 --> 1:13:52.109
common.
We all face this.

1:13:52.109 --> 1:13:56.414
But I think the difference, is
do we decide, and do we choose,

1:13:56.414 --> 1:13:57.830
to live in vision or do we live
in circumstance?

1:13:57.830 --> 1:14:00.318
To live in vision or do we live
in circumstance?

1:14:00.318 --> 1:14:04.822
And I don't know about you guys,
but I wake up every single

1:14:04.822 --> 1:14:06.891
morning.
I choose to live in vision.

1:14:06.891 --> 1:14:10.728
Find happiness, knowing that
life will work its way out.

1:14:10.728 --> 1:14:18.703
And we will find ourselves.
Thank you.

1:14:18.703 --> 1:14:23.574
I tell you what.
Every one of us can relate to

1:14:23.574 --> 1:14:25.243
this.
When life just kicks us when we

1:14:25.243 --> 1:14:27.830
are down, and those moments that
life just decides to bury us,

1:14:27.830 --> 1:14:30.281
are down, and those moments that
life just decides to bury us,

1:14:30.281 --> 1:14:34.819
but if we stick together.
And we believe in one another.

1:14:34.819 --> 1:14:38.256
We will rise to the top.
Ladies and gentlemen, that is

1:14:38.256 --> 1:14:47.331
how we will never lose
ourselves.

1:14:47.331 --> 1:14:51.736
A minute ago, a minute ago I
told you guys that magic saved

1:14:51.736 --> 1:14:53.905
my life.
The magic is not in these hand.

1:14:53.905 --> 1:14:57.675
Not in the card.
It's in every one of us.

1:14:57.675 --> 1:14:57.830
It's in our breath, it's in our
touch, in our words.

1:14:57.830 --> 1:14:59.977
It's in our breath, it's in our
touch, in our words.

1:14:59.977 --> 1:15:02.813
If the's what we think about
this world and what we think

1:15:02.813 --> 1:15:05.950
about each other.
Simon, I had you write the name

1:15:05.950 --> 1:15:08.019
Eric.
Thought I would make a to do

1:15:08.019 --> 1:15:10.421
list for you.
Every night may the magic live

1:15:10.421 --> 1:15:12.123
in your home.
Grab your son.

1:15:12.123 --> 1:15:15.993
Tell Eric you love it.
Cross that off your list every

1:15:15.993 --> 1:15:17.461
single night.
Ladies and gentlemen, may this

1:15:17.461 --> 1:15:19.397
world be magic.
I love you.

1:15:19.397 --> 1:15:23.100
This has been one of the
greatest opportunities of my

1:15:23.100 --> 1:15:24.735
life.
I am jon dorenbros.

1:15:24.735 --> 1:15:27.830
- Peace out, ladies and gentlemen.
- Jon dorenbros.

1:15:27.830 --> 1:15:32.910
- Peace out, ladies and gentlemen.
- Jon dorenbros.

1:15:32.910 --> 1:15:40.184
We don't know how he does it.
That was like 100 magic tricks

1:15:40.184 --> 1:15:42.887
in 90 second.
Howie.

1:15:42.887 --> 1:15:44.722
It was more than
magic.

1:15:44.722 --> 1:15:46.657
It was inspirational.
Made names appear.

1:15:46.657 --> 1:15:49.260
Card appear.
Made tears appear.

1:15:49.260 --> 1:15:51.395
Knowing your story, you really
do have a message.

1:15:51.395 --> 1:15:55.533
You really are on a mission.
And you really are a star.

1:15:55.533 --> 1:15:57.830
And, thank you for that moment.
Thank you for that inspiration.

1:15:57.830 --> 1:15:58.336
And, thank you for that moment.
Thank you for that inspiration.

1:15:58.336 --> 1:16:00.838
And not only, I want people at
home not only to vote.

1:16:00.838 --> 1:16:02.940
But I want them to remember your
word.

1:16:02.940 --> 1:16:07.845
And live by your message that
you just gave out.

1:16:07.845 --> 1:16:10.214
- >> Thank you.
- Mel b.?

1:16:10.214 --> 1:16:13.150
I thought I was being a
bit crazy at first.

1:16:13.150 --> 1:16:14.885
I didn't quite understand what
was going on.

1:16:14.885 --> 1:16:19.056
Then I think I was so taken
aback with your speech and

1:16:19.056 --> 1:16:21.792
inspired, I forgot to look at
what you was actually doing.

1:16:21.792 --> 1:16:25.129
Then when I focused I was like,
oh my good he is making things

1:16:25.129 --> 1:16:27.631
just appear out of like,
nowhere.

1:16:27.631 --> 1:16:27.830
We written it here.
Then there, then it appears.

1:16:27.830 --> 1:16:29.934
We written it here.
Then there, then it appears.

1:16:29.934 --> 1:16:32.803
I think you are brilliant at
what you do.

1:16:32.803 --> 1:16:35.206
The way you present it is
spot‐on.

1:16:35.206 --> 1:16:37.074
Managed to figure it out.
Now you are just magic.

1:16:37.074 --> 1:16:40.978
- That's it.
- Heidi?

1:16:40.978 --> 1:16:43.547
All right, let's
forget about you being a famous

1:16:43.547 --> 1:16:46.917
football player.
Go, bird.

1:16:46.917 --> 1:16:49.887
Let's forget about you being
really, really good at magic.

1:16:49.887 --> 1:16:51.789
What you did was so
inspirational.

1:16:51.789 --> 1:16:54.558
So positive.
You really are a class act.

1:16:54.558 --> 1:16:57.830
- I wish for you to win this too.
- Simon.

1:16:57.830 --> 1:16:59.830
- I wish for you to win this too.
- Simon.

1:16:59.830 --> 1:17:01.532
I only have a few
second.

1:17:01.532 --> 1:17:03.300
I will say this.
You talk the talk.

1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:06.103
You walk the walk.
But, you're more than just a

1:17:06.103 --> 1:17:08.939
great performer.
You are someone who I think we

1:17:08.939 --> 1:17:12.610
would all be very proud to say
the winner of this show is jon

1:17:12.610 --> 1:17:17.148

- Wow.

1:17:17.148 --> 1:17:19.583
Jon, truly inspiring everything
that you have done.

1:17:19.583 --> 1:17:22.887
What is impressive to me is your
hard work.

1:17:22.887 --> 1:17:27.058
You literally just stepped of
the football field in an NFL

1:17:27.058 --> 1:17:27.830
game.
Came here, blew everyone away.

1:17:27.830 --> 1:17:28.125
Game.
Came here, blew everyone away.

1:17:28.125 --> 1:17:32.863
To win this whole thing, knowing
your journey, hard work, what

1:17:32.863 --> 1:17:35.166
would it mean to you?
>> This would mean the world.

1:17:35.166 --> 1:17:37.568
Let me tell you, when you are
down.

1:17:37.568 --> 1:17:39.336
don't listen to yourself.
Talk to yourself.

1:17:39.336 --> 1:17:41.138
Telling myself.
I want to win this.

1:17:41.138 --> 1:17:42.840
Share the magic.
I want a show.

1:17:42.840 --> 1:17:45.843
And I want to connect with you
guys every single day of my

1:17:45.843 --> 1:17:47.244
life.
Thank you very much.

1:17:47.244 --> 1:17:51.916
Good luck.

did so well, and why she is
going to be some one we are all

1:23:57.274 --> 1:24:01.077
