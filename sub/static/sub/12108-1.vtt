03:07.338 --> 03:09.033
- Want toast?
- Yes.

03:09.106 --> 03:10.801
Ellie, where's your cereal bowl?

03:10.874 --> 03:12.808
- I'm not hungry.
- You need to eat.

03:12.876 --> 03:15.743
- I'm not hungry, Mom.
- You need to eat before school.

03:15.813 --> 03:17.781
- One more bite.
- You want jelly?

03:17.848 --> 03:19.475
Yes, please.

03:19.550 --> 03:22.678
Watch it, Brenda.
Don't mess my clothes up.

03:22.753 --> 03:24.721
Billy Baker's in my class this year.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.756
- Oh, did he flunk too?
- Shut up!

03:26.824 --> 03:29.384
- Hey!
- You're one to talk.

03:29.460 --> 03:32.395
- Are you excited about school?
- Yeah.

03:32.464 --> 03:34.398
- Isn't your sister cute?
- You stink.

03:34.466 --> 03:35.558
Very cute.

03:35.634 --> 03:38.603
He stinks. He's gotta shower
before he eats with us.

03:38.670 --> 03:40.865
Stop picking
on your brother and eat.

03:44.776 --> 03:45.902
May Belle?

03:45.977 --> 03:48.104
- Honey, here's your juice.
- Thanks.

03:49.714 --> 03:51.682
OK, who hid my sneakers?

03:51.750 --> 03:55.242
Jess, you could hardly call them
sneakers anymore. I threw them out.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.981
What? Mom!

03:57.055 --> 04:00.958
Sorry, but I will not send any child of
mine to school looking like some hobo.

04:01.027 --> 04:04.428
There's a perfectly good old pair
of Brenda's I put out for you.

04:05.998 --> 04:07.465
These are girls' ones.

04:07.533 --> 04:10.229
It's the fan belt this time,
but I got another.

04:10.303 --> 04:12.897
- Bye-bye.
- Ellie? Honey, here you go.

04:12.972 --> 04:15.532
- What's the matter?
- There's a big race today.

04:15.608 --> 04:17.666
- And?
- My sneakers.

04:17.743 --> 04:20.940
- I got a perfectly good pair for him.
- These are girls' ones.

04:21.012 --> 04:24.107
- I can't race in these.
- You couldn't race in your old ones.

04:24.183 --> 04:26.175
He needs some new sneakers, Mary.

04:27.421 --> 04:30.948
- Catch Billy's eye in that.
- We don't have anything for extras.

04:31.024 --> 04:34.016
- Excuse me?
- You're excused.

04:34.094 --> 04:36.824
They make them the same.
You got your chores done?

04:38.265 --> 04:39.698
Just about to.

05:17.739 --> 05:21.437
I try to keep my pit stops
under ten seconds, ace.

05:22.544 --> 05:24.307
Give it to me.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.746
- Give it...
- Hey, that's my lunch!

05:26.815 --> 05:28.248
I found it!

05:30.719 --> 05:33.711
You're kidding me.

05:34.323 --> 05:35.984
OK, that's enough.

05:36.392 --> 05:38.917
Consider it a free lunch program,
farmer boy!

05:38.994 --> 05:40.723
All right, settle down.

05:41.497 --> 05:42.828
Good one, Janice.

05:42.898 --> 05:45.663
What do you call your teacher?
I wanna tell Alexandra.

05:45.735 --> 05:48.363
- "Monster Mouth. " Now scoot.
- Alexandra,

05:48.438 --> 05:53.398
- they call her "Monster Mouth" Myers.
- I said scoot!

05:53.643 --> 05:55.412
A few ground rules for this classroom.

05:55.678 --> 05:59.705
No talking. No chewing gum.
No electronic devices. Be forewarned.

05:59.783 --> 06:01.944
If you download essays
off the Internet,

06:02.018 --> 06:04.953
you'll be downloaded into detention.

06:05.021 --> 06:08.718
Let's start the year off on
the right foot and all do our own work.

06:08.792 --> 06:11.660
- I expect you to take notes.
- Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,

06:11.729 --> 06:15.961
Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep.
Know what that is? My loser detector.

06:18.202 --> 06:19.464
Jesse Aarons!

06:20.671 --> 06:23.697
I got it from your sisters.
I do not need it from you.

06:23.774 --> 06:26.106
- Oh, man.
- That goes for you as well.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.667
He hit me.

06:28.879 --> 06:32.042
- You're dead meat.
- Scott Hoager and Gary Fulcher,

06:32.116 --> 06:33.140
be quiet!

06:33.751 --> 06:37.586
Now, back to what we were discussing
before we were so rudely interrupted.

06:37.656 --> 06:39.749
Sweet sneaks, Aarons.

06:39.825 --> 06:43.056
You wear your sisters'
hand-me-down underwear too?

06:43.128 --> 06:46.256
He asked you a question,
twinkle toes.

06:50.068 --> 06:53.663
Good morning, kids. Welcome back.
I hope you had a great summer.

06:53.738 --> 06:57.469
Mrs. Myers, this is Leslie Burke,
who will be joining your class.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.410
- Leslie, welcome to Lark Creek.
- Thanks.

07:01.480 --> 07:05.076
Thank you, Principal Turner.

07:05.151 --> 07:08.279
Well, Leslie, um,
you'll sit at my desk this morning,

07:08.354 --> 07:11.517
until we can figure out
where to squeeze you in.

07:14.994 --> 07:18.122
I like to start the year
with a little fun.

07:18.197 --> 07:21.860
I want you all to write a one-page
essay about your favorite hobby.

07:21.934 --> 07:23.424
Yes?

07:23.503 --> 07:27.496
Mrs. Myers, when you say one page,
did you mean both sides of the paper?

07:27.573 --> 07:30.873
- You can do one side, Madison.
- I'll do two.

07:30.944 --> 07:34.209
- Yeah, that's cool.
- No way!

07:34.281 --> 07:37.148
- It was so amazing.
- Can I have this?

07:37.217 --> 07:40.550
You could have two bucks out of it all.
I'm getting most of it, OK?

07:41.955 --> 07:43.320
- Excuse me.
- Got a dollar?

07:43.891 --> 07:46.621
- No.
- You're gonna have to use your pants.

07:47.861 --> 07:50.352
- What's your problem?
- You got that backwards.

07:50.430 --> 07:53.331
- You got the problem.
- That's right, new girl.

07:54.868 --> 07:58.305
- Nice feet.
- You say something?

07:58.373 --> 07:59.840
What I said was,

07:59.908 --> 08:03.366
have you ever heard the story
about the trolls under the bridges

08:03.444 --> 08:05.878
who collect tolls
from unlucky travelers?

08:05.947 --> 08:08.006
Trolls?
What is she talking about?

08:09.484 --> 08:12.817
Nice try, beanpole.
It's still a dollar.

08:33.808 --> 08:35.071
Yeah!

08:36.578 --> 08:39.446
- Let's do it. Do it.
- Yeah, we've got Hoager.

08:41.517 --> 08:44.452
Next grade, line up.
Let's do this thing. Come on.

08:44.987 --> 08:46.614
Fulcher, Hoager, get in here.

08:47.256 --> 08:49.589
Get ready.
Let's get this race started.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.456
- Beep, beep, beep.
- Dead meat.

08:51.528 --> 08:56.124
Back behind the line. You know
how it goes. Back behind. Come on.

08:56.199 --> 08:58.633
Hey, new girl.
This is just for guys.

08:58.702 --> 09:00.363
Hey, I'm talking to you!

09:00.437 --> 09:03.406
What's the matter?
Afraid a girl's gonna beat you?

09:05.208 --> 09:08.143
- On your mark. Get set.
- Dead meat.

09:17.321 --> 09:18.788
Go, Hoager!
Get in there!

09:26.964 --> 09:30.092
Go! Go, Jess, go!

09:32.970 --> 09:34.494
Come on!

09:34.572 --> 09:36.369
Come on! You can do it!

09:36.440 --> 09:38.670
Come on, Jess!

09:38.743 --> 09:40.734
Go, Jess, go!

09:55.861 --> 09:58.125
Jess, Jess, did you win?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.198
Hey, Jess, right?

10:14.514 --> 10:16.778
- Idiot!
- What?

10:19.018 --> 10:21.248
- See you tomorrow.
- Ten seconds, ace.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.451
Thank you.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.329
Are you following me?

10:33.399 --> 10:35.265
No. I live over there.

10:35.335 --> 10:38.236
We're neighbors?
You got little sisters?

10:38.305 --> 10:41.206
- No. Just me.
- Oh.

10:41.275 --> 10:43.140
You got any Barbies?

10:43.444 --> 10:46.675
Yeah. I think I have a few.
You got any?

10:46.747 --> 10:50.843
- Yeah, I have one... and a half.
- And a half?

10:50.918 --> 10:54.149
One got cut in half
playing Super Extreme Barbies.

10:54.221 --> 10:55.654
Never heard of that before.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.691
You flush the toilet
with them in it,

10:57.758 --> 11:00.455
drop them from the upstairs window,
stuff like that.

11:00.528 --> 11:03.691
- It's really fun.
- Sounds like fun.

11:03.765 --> 11:07.326
- Well, I'll see you around.
- Yeah. See ya.

11:07.402 --> 11:08.699
- See ya.
- Hey, guys.

11:08.770 --> 11:09.759
Hey, Dad.

11:09.838 --> 11:12.898
- I'm getting supplies. You wanna come?
- Yeah. Sure.

11:13.308 --> 11:14.707
See ya.

11:17.112 --> 11:19.512
There we go.
This'll make it feel better.

11:19.581 --> 11:22.744
- How come it's my fault?
- When I ask you to watch the baby,

11:22.817 --> 11:25.411
- I mean watch the baby, Brenda.
- It's Ellie's turn.

11:25.487 --> 11:28.423
- I'm doing my algebra.
- Put more cream on there.

11:28.491 --> 11:30.925
You girls have to start
helping out more here.

11:30.993 --> 11:32.654
You're not little kids anymore.

11:42.271 --> 11:45.434
May Belle! How many times have
I told you, stay out of my stuff.

11:45.508 --> 11:47.567
- It wasn't me.
- It was too you.

11:47.643 --> 11:50.339
- You can't prove it!
- There a problem here?

11:50.412 --> 11:52.710
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetie.

11:52.783 --> 11:54.978
Is he picking on you?

11:55.819 --> 11:58.845
- She was in my stuff.
- What stuff?

12:08.265 --> 12:09.960
How'd that race go?

12:10.033 --> 12:12.593
There's this new girl
moved in next door.

12:12.669 --> 12:15.934
She beat all of the boys.
Even Jess.

12:19.510 --> 12:22.274
Make sure you take out
the garbage before supper.

12:22.547 --> 12:25.607
One drop.

12:25.683 --> 12:29.119
And that's the magic.
Here comes May Belle's flowers.

12:31.255 --> 12:32.745
Are these ever gonna grow?

12:32.824 --> 12:36.260
This greenhouse is gonna be filled
with your purple flowers.

12:36.327 --> 12:39.319
May Belle's flowers.

12:40.264 --> 12:43.631
I always wanted the one
that had, like, purple all over it.

12:45.470 --> 12:47.461
They are so cool.

12:47.539 --> 12:50.007
- These things are gonna grow fast.
- Me too.

12:50.075 --> 12:52.942
- Tomorrow, it's gonna be filled.
- Yeah.

12:53.011 --> 12:56.208
The bell's gonna ring!

12:56.281 --> 12:59.739
- Good morning, everybody!
- Good morning, Ms. Edmunds!

12:59.818 --> 13:01.877
Aren't you glad
that summer's over?

13:01.954 --> 13:05.412
- No!
- No? I am.

13:05.490 --> 13:07.685
Come and get your instruments.

13:07.759 --> 13:09.624
- Can I play the woodblock?
- Yes.

13:11.530 --> 13:14.159
Ms. Edmunds?
May I please play the castanets?

13:14.234 --> 13:17.465
Yes, you may.
Everybody ready for music?

13:18.037 --> 13:20.699
Take a picture.
Lasts longer.

13:20.907 --> 13:24.138
<i>It's awfully quiet.
# Old McDonald had a farm...</i>

13:24.210 --> 13:27.145
- No!
- No? You don't like that song?

13:27.213 --> 13:29.681
- No!
- Then make some noise. Come on.

14:31.147 --> 14:33.479
- We saw this video yesterday.
- Whatever.

14:33.549 --> 14:36.313
Change it!
Give it... give it to me!

14:36.385 --> 14:38.615
Stop it.
You're always fighting.

14:38.688 --> 14:42.089
- Wait till I get my own place.
- I wanna watch this.

14:42.158 --> 14:45.127
We just
can't keep going like this.

14:45.194 --> 14:48.561
Honey, uh... I've only got what I've got
to work with. We gotta...

14:48.631 --> 14:51.156
You gotta figure out
a way to get down on this.

14:51.233 --> 14:54.168
It's a problem,
but I'm gonna try to get going.

14:54.236 --> 14:58.037
And maybe you can pick up
another shift at the store.

14:59.343 --> 15:00.833
Dead meat.

15:04.348 --> 15:06.316
Wow.

15:06.383 --> 15:09.181
You're really good at drawing.

15:09.252 --> 15:12.244
Like, better than any kid
I've ever seen.

15:12.322 --> 15:13.914
Uh... Thanks.

15:17.327 --> 15:20.387
I wanna share
this composition for two reasons.

15:20.464 --> 15:23.923
One, it uses adjectives well.
And two,

15:24.002 --> 15:28.769
it's clear the author paid attention
to what she saw and what she felt,

15:28.840 --> 15:32.332
which is important for any writing.

15:32.410 --> 15:37.313
<i>Self-Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus by Leslie Burke.</i>

15:38.182 --> 15:40.412
Leslie, why don't you read it for us.

15:41.119 --> 15:42.814
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

15:52.398 --> 15:54.229
"I'm moving gently forward,

15:54.500 --> 15:58.869
over the wild and beautiful,
unexplored world below me.

15:59.171 --> 16:01.435
I'm floating in silence,

16:01.774 --> 16:04.538
and breaking it up
with the sound of my breath.

16:04.610 --> 16:08.546
Above me, there's nothing
but shimmery light,

16:08.614 --> 16:10.605
the place where I've come from,

16:10.682 --> 16:13.150
and will go back to
when I am done here.

16:13.218 --> 16:15.652
I'm diving.

16:15.721 --> 16:18.384
I'm a scuba diver.

16:18.458 --> 16:22.019
I'm going deeper past
the wrinkled rocks and dark seaweed

16:22.095 --> 16:26.156
toward a deep blueness
where a school of silver fish wait.

16:27.467 --> 16:30.163
As I swim through the water,

16:30.236 --> 16:32.864
bubbles burst from me,

16:32.939 --> 16:35.840
wobbling like little jellyfish
as they rise.

16:35.909 --> 16:37.877
I check my air.

16:37.944 --> 16:40.913
I don't have as much time
as I need to see everything,

16:40.980 --> 16:43.779
but that is what makes it so special. "

16:44.685 --> 16:48.212
Thank you, Leslie.
Now tonight at 7:00 on channel four

16:48.289 --> 16:52.589
there is a special about
an undersea explorer, Dr. Bob Ballard.

16:52.660 --> 16:56.994
I want everyone to watch and write one
page about what you've learned.

16:57.064 --> 16:58.531
Leslie?

16:58.599 --> 17:00.726
What if you can't watch this program?

17:00.801 --> 17:04.396
Inform your parents it's an assignment,
I'm sure they won't object.

17:04.472 --> 17:07.531
But... what if you don't have a TV?

17:14.648 --> 17:16.776
My dad says the TV
kills your brain cells.

17:16.852 --> 17:21.152
Your dad doesn't know anything.
We watch TV, like, every day.

17:21.223 --> 17:23.453
- I rest my case.
- Well, then, Leslie,

17:23.525 --> 17:27.461
you don't have to write this essay.
Pick something else to write about.

17:27.529 --> 17:30.123
Yeah, like, how to live in a cave.

17:30.198 --> 17:32.359
That's enough, Mr. Hoager.

17:38.374 --> 17:40.137
Hey, Leslie, come here.

17:40.209 --> 17:43.440
What are you gonna write your essay on?
Bats in caves?

17:57.426 --> 18:00.589
- Here comes Janice!
- New kid's in Janice's seat.

18:00.663 --> 18:04.862
- What does she think she's doing?
- Jess! The big kids will kill her!

18:06.170 --> 18:08.934
You have a death wish?
This row's for eighth-graders.

18:09.006 --> 18:13.875
That's right, beanpole. Move it.
Out of my way, farm boy.

18:32.197 --> 18:34.597
You're really asking for it.

18:34.666 --> 18:37.794
Seems to me she gives it out
whether you ask for it or not.

18:37.869 --> 18:40.030
So might as well have some fun.

18:40.104 --> 18:43.835
Getting Janice all wound up
is a weird way of having fun.

18:45.510 --> 18:48.343
Well, what's your idea of having fun?

18:48.680 --> 18:51.274
- I don't know.
- Well, you wanna do something?

18:51.916 --> 18:54.511
- I don't know.
- Let's do something. Definitely.

18:54.587 --> 18:55.884
- What?
- You can't do it.

18:55.955 --> 18:58.753
- Do what?
- What we're doing.

19:03.796 --> 19:07.197
Hey, May Belle!
I don't use my Barbies anymore.

19:07.266 --> 19:10.531
- If you want, you can have them.
- To keep for permanent?

19:10.603 --> 19:12.571
- Sure.
- Thanks.

19:15.341 --> 19:17.002
You're lucky to have a sister.

19:17.076 --> 19:19.943
I've got four, and I'd
trade them all for a good dog.

19:20.012 --> 19:22.379
I'd love to have a dog.

19:22.449 --> 19:24.747
Now let's go before
she changes her mind.

19:25.385 --> 19:28.286
Race you to the end of the road.
On your mark, get set, go!

19:59.153 --> 20:01.087
Come on, Jess!

20:01.155 --> 20:02.281
Come on!

20:07.328 --> 20:09.558
What about sharks?

20:11.198 --> 20:13.929
You ever see any sharks while you're

20:14.002 --> 20:16.163
scuba-ing or whatever?

20:16.238 --> 20:18.934
I've never gone scuba diving
in my whole life.

20:20.342 --> 20:23.834
- You lied in your essay?
- No. I made it up.

20:23.912 --> 20:26.176
It's different from lying.

20:27.683 --> 20:30.914
Those drawings you make,
you seen those things yourself?

20:31.820 --> 20:33.754
No, but...

20:38.327 --> 20:39.852
Hey! Look at that!

20:40.296 --> 20:42.196
- Cool!
- That's been there forever.

20:42.265 --> 20:43.664
I wouldn't trust it.

20:44.467 --> 20:46.298
Come on. Just try it.

20:48.705 --> 20:50.195
OK.

20:56.779 --> 20:58.940
You got it? That's it.

21:00.550 --> 21:01.915
Thanks.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.486
- What are you doing?
- Getting up higher.

21:09.426 --> 21:10.723
OK.

21:18.969 --> 21:22.234
Wow! That was so much fun.
You have to try it. Come on.

21:43.695 --> 21:45.128
OK.

22:02.782 --> 22:04.943
Let your head hang back,
watch the clouds.

22:05.017 --> 22:06.848
Feels like flying.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.307
- We need a place. Just for us.
- Hmm?

22:37.451 --> 22:40.386
Where there's no
Janice Averys or Scott Hoagers.

22:40.454 --> 22:44.288
Yeah, but when we go back to school,
there they are waiting.

22:44.357 --> 22:46.052
Yeah, but...

22:46.126 --> 22:49.289
...someplace better than
just not being at school.

22:49.996 --> 22:52.932
What if there was a magical kingdom
only we knew about?

22:54.101 --> 22:55.762
I don't know. What if?

22:55.837 --> 22:58.101
OK, well...

22:58.172 --> 23:00.834
...what if the only way
we could enter it

23:00.908 --> 23:03.274
is by swinging on this enchanted rope?

23:03.344 --> 23:06.313
- Enchanted rope?
- Yeah.

23:07.215 --> 23:08.842
Come on.

23:14.055 --> 23:16.114
Leslie!

23:17.493 --> 23:18.517
Leslie!

23:29.471 --> 23:31.234
Leslie.

23:36.445 --> 23:38.777
- Come on!
- Wait up.

24:08.411 --> 24:09.935
Ahh!

24:10.013 --> 24:12.574
We shouldn't be in here.
This isn't our land.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.710
- Not so loud. They'll hear you.
- What are you talking about?

24:22.560 --> 24:24.755
Hey! What's that?

24:26.864 --> 24:30.391
Whoa. Jess, look at this. Wow.

24:32.903 --> 24:36.339
Too bad for them.
They got so close.

24:36.408 --> 24:39.571
- What are you talking about?
- To the kingdom.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.508
- What's that?
- What?

24:44.583 --> 24:47.780
That sound. I've heard it before.
Someone's out there.

24:47.852 --> 24:50.844
That's the sound of the prisoners
rattling their chains.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.556
What prisoners?

24:53.625 --> 24:56.059
The prisoners of the Dark Master.

24:59.998 --> 25:02.934
- We should go.
- Wait, Jess, look.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.897
What is it?

25:10.076 --> 25:11.600
Look at this.

25:19.018 --> 25:21.680
Wow. This is amazing.

25:26.058 --> 25:27.252
Wow.

25:39.039 --> 25:40.028
This is it.

25:56.257 --> 25:57.918
Warriors.

25:59.661 --> 26:03.495
- Try dragonflies.
- No. They're warriors.

26:03.564 --> 26:05.930
From the treetop provinces.

26:07.101 --> 26:11.333
- I don't know this game.
- What game? This is for real.

26:13.708 --> 26:17.542
This is the ruins
of a once great fortress

26:17.612 --> 26:20.103
whose people have been imprisoned.

26:22.217 --> 26:25.186
Jess, you and I have been
sent to free them.

26:27.356 --> 26:30.689
Prisoners of the Dark Master, hear me!

26:31.326 --> 26:34.090
We have come to free you.

26:34.163 --> 26:35.824
Do you hear us?

26:35.898 --> 26:37.866
Show me that you hear us!

26:45.874 --> 26:49.311
You got lucky timing. The wind's
been blowing off and on all day.

26:51.114 --> 26:55.847
Can't hear you!

27:30.554 --> 27:33.648
- Go straight home. I'll see you soon.
- OK. See ya!

28:58.912 --> 29:01.643
Hey, don't you think
we should give her a hand?

29:04.886 --> 29:06.478
Uh... She's... She's fine.

29:06.988 --> 29:09.479
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

29:09.557 --> 29:11.218
...forget. There are four of us.

29:11.292 --> 29:12.623
OK.

29:14.562 --> 29:16.553
Remember to bring your bag.

29:16.631 --> 29:19.099
Why would anyone
want to wear that?

29:24.739 --> 29:26.173
Janice!

29:26.242 --> 29:27.869
- You OK?
- What's the problem?

29:27.943 --> 29:30.707
- Jess Aarons tripped me.
- Uh...

29:30.779 --> 29:32.838
On purpose.

29:32.915 --> 29:35.509
OK, Aarons. Hit the road.

29:36.652 --> 29:38.950
- But he didn't do anything.
- Go.

29:39.021 --> 29:42.752
- It was definitely him.
- I know.

29:58.141 --> 30:02.305
- What happened to you?
- Janice is a very talented person.

30:02.379 --> 30:05.212
She can shoot ketchup packets
over four rows of seats.

30:05.282 --> 30:07.045
Jeez.

30:07.450 --> 30:10.544
Can I wash up at your house?
My mom sees this, she'll be all over

30:10.620 --> 30:13.248
the principal and everybody,
and my life will be over.

30:16.259 --> 30:19.354
<i>Why would Dad do this?</i>

30:19.430 --> 30:21.364
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh.

30:21.432 --> 30:23.866
Mom, this is Leslie.

30:23.935 --> 30:25.800
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

30:25.870 --> 30:28.566
- It's nice to meet you.
- Thank you. You too.

30:29.707 --> 30:32.301
So are you and your family
getting settled in OK?

30:32.376 --> 30:35.777
- Yes, ma'am.
- That's nice.

30:35.846 --> 30:38.474
- Come on. See ya later.
- Not too late, OK, honey?

30:39.283 --> 30:44.243
- Weird and weirder.
- Hey. Be glad he's found a friend.

30:44.322 --> 30:48.054
- Where's your dad work?
- At home. Same as my mom.

30:48.126 --> 30:50.219
- They're writers.
- Writers?

30:50.295 --> 30:53.389
- What do they write about?
- Fiction.

30:53.465 --> 30:55.092
That explains you.

30:56.568 --> 31:00.004
- What do you mean?
- Well, you like to make things up.

31:00.072 --> 31:02.563
And that's what your parents
do for a living.

31:03.942 --> 31:06.570
You know a lot about hardware?

31:06.645 --> 31:08.579
No. Why?

31:08.647 --> 31:12.209
Well, your dad works
at a hardware store.

31:12.285 --> 31:13.946
OK.

31:14.454 --> 31:17.150
All I'm saying is that
you are who you are...

31:17.223 --> 31:18.884
...not your parents.

31:21.394 --> 31:24.955
If they work at your house, you must
get to hang out with them a lot.

31:27.734 --> 31:29.497
Not really.

31:31.971 --> 31:33.734
What's that?

31:33.806 --> 31:36.673
- Grenade.
- There're no grenades here.

31:40.047 --> 31:41.241
Come on!

31:44.918 --> 31:48.319
- Squirrels!
- Part squirrel, part Scott Hoager.

31:48.389 --> 31:51.415
- Squogre.
- Squogre!

31:51.792 --> 31:54.317
The sneaky foot soldiers
of the Dark Master.

31:55.462 --> 31:57.692
- They're attacking!
- We need ammo!

32:05.440 --> 32:07.465
This is not good.

32:09.377 --> 32:12.869
- See them? Up there?
- Yeah.

32:12.947 --> 32:16.974
- Do you? Really?
- Yeah.

32:27.662 --> 32:28.924
Les...

32:30.098 --> 32:31.259
Leslie?

32:33.002 --> 32:36.301
Leslie. Leslie!

32:38.007 --> 32:40.567
Come on. You can see
the whole kingdom from up here.

32:44.146 --> 32:47.172
Isn't this cool?
We can do anything here.

32:56.893 --> 32:58.793
Look at it.

32:58.862 --> 33:01.592
It's all ours.

33:01.665 --> 33:05.157
From the mountains to the oceans.

33:08.071 --> 33:10.733
- What am I looking for exactly?
- You'll see.

33:10.807 --> 33:13.776
Just close your eyes...

33:13.844 --> 33:15.607
...but keep your mind wide open.

33:30.361 --> 33:31.555
Wow.

33:33.297 --> 33:35.356
What do we call this place?

33:38.402 --> 33:39.994
Terabithia.

33:46.677 --> 33:51.138
Shh.
Everybody tiptoe. OK, ready?

33:52.017 --> 33:54.417
Happy birthday!

33:54.486 --> 34:01.420
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

34:01.493 --> 34:05.327
<i># Happy birthday, dear Jess</i>

34:05.397 --> 34:08.331
<i># Happy birthday to you #</i>

34:08.699 --> 34:09.996
Make a wish.

34:10.835 --> 34:12.827
- Yay!
- What'd you wish for?

34:18.945 --> 34:22.402
- This is cheap junk.
- No, it isn't.

34:22.482 --> 34:25.280
- I love it.
- How? It doesn't even work.

34:25.351 --> 34:28.114
I don't think we have
the hang of it yet, Dad.

34:28.188 --> 34:31.248
You know what? Keep the box.
We'll see if we can take it back.

34:33.226 --> 34:35.751
Daddy, there's something
in the greenhouse.

34:41.634 --> 34:45.002
That's the last thing I need,
some animal chewing it's way in here.

34:46.005 --> 34:48.371
What are you going to do
if you catch it?

34:48.442 --> 34:50.739
These vegetables are our livelihood.

34:50.811 --> 34:54.007
Can't afford to share them
with animals that get in here.

34:54.915 --> 34:56.882
- So, you're gonna kill it?
- Have to.

34:59.486 --> 35:03.718
Well, he's not gonna
get in here now, right, Dad?

35:03.791 --> 35:07.488
Hope not. But if he does,
you just let me deal with it.

35:08.930 --> 35:11.194
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

35:11.266 --> 35:14.997
No, why don't you go on and do
your homework, I'll clean this mess up.

35:26.848 --> 35:28.816
Under the seat.

35:33.755 --> 35:35.917
I heard it was
your birthday yesterday.

35:40.162 --> 35:43.097
- Like it?
- Wow.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.424
It must've cost a fortune.

35:46.969 --> 35:49.164
What's it matter what it costs?

35:50.106 --> 35:51.368
I don't know.

35:51.440 --> 35:54.876
Well, I can take it back
and get a cheaper one, if you want.

35:56.646 --> 35:59.638
Thanks... a lot.

36:00.549 --> 36:03.451
<i># Jess and Leslie sitting in a tree...</i>

36:14.665 --> 36:16.690
Look.
The squogre and the vulture.

36:16.767 --> 36:18.462
Hey, here he comes.

36:18.535 --> 36:22.062
And a guy who can stand up to a squogre
is scared of a Hoager?

36:25.108 --> 36:27.201
Ms. Edmunds?

36:27.277 --> 36:30.145
- He speaks.
- Can I help you with those?

36:30.214 --> 36:33.615
You sure can.
And you just made my day.

36:36.220 --> 36:37.653
- Great.
- I'll get that one.

36:37.722 --> 36:39.019
Thank you.

36:46.197 --> 36:49.257
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hi, boys.

36:56.408 --> 36:58.808
How come you're so good at that?

36:58.877 --> 37:01.038
- Good at what?
- Building stuff.

37:01.113 --> 37:02.637
You're good at it for a girl.

37:02.715 --> 37:05.616
Same way I'm fast... for a girl.

37:05.684 --> 37:08.209
You know what I mean.

37:08.287 --> 37:11.381
You're pretty good at art... for a boy.

37:11.457 --> 37:13.357
OK, OK, truce.

37:17.496 --> 37:19.964
Don't your parents notice
this stuff's missing?

37:20.066 --> 37:22.466
Not when they're in
the middle of writing a book.

37:22.535 --> 37:25.095
What's that?

37:26.272 --> 37:27.466
Show yourselves!

37:41.087 --> 37:43.453
It's a giant troll!

37:43.523 --> 37:45.753
No, it's a giant tree
that almost killed us!

37:45.825 --> 37:48.317
You think that tree
just fell all by itself?

37:49.563 --> 37:50.655
Come on.

37:50.731 --> 37:54.167
When the Dark Master saw
the squogres weren't scaring us away,

37:54.235 --> 37:57.727
- he sent a giant troll.
- How big?

38:02.243 --> 38:04.234
That's how big its feet are.

38:07.481 --> 38:10.678
- You really think so?
- What else could it be?

38:12.453 --> 38:14.285
What should we do?

38:19.795 --> 38:23.629
If we had a troll hunter, we could
track its scent and sneak up on it.

38:24.433 --> 38:26.424
Hey, look at that! Come on!

38:29.204 --> 38:30.671
I think it went that way!

38:31.640 --> 38:34.905
We rule Terabithia,
and nothing crushes us!

38:39.682 --> 38:41.274
I'll race you to the rope.

38:47.390 --> 38:49.881
I love this place!

39:07.711 --> 39:10.475
Go on, get out of here.
And don't come back.

39:24.261 --> 39:26.252
What do you think you're doing?

39:26.330 --> 39:30.289
- I took care of it for you.
- Did you, now? Now, how'd you do that?

39:30.367 --> 39:33.269
I took him into the forest.
He's not coming back, promise.

39:33.338 --> 39:36.705
Did he tell you he's gonna
stay the hell out of the greenhouse?

39:36.774 --> 39:39.265
No, he went out there
and he's not coming...

39:39.344 --> 39:41.608
Jess, you need to understand
something, OK?

39:41.679 --> 39:45.547
This is not one of your cartoons. This
is just a pest that eats up our food,

39:45.617 --> 39:47.778
money we earn and time we don't have.

39:49.153 --> 39:51.053
- OK.
- Get your head out of the clouds

39:51.122 --> 39:52.316
and do as I say.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.087
OK.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.226
Good night, sweetheart.

40:28.962 --> 40:30.554
Sweet dreams.

40:31.631 --> 40:35.032
Lights out, Jess.

40:35.101 --> 40:36.728
Night, Dad.

40:42.943 --> 40:45.707
Are we slaying the giant troll
after school today?

40:45.779 --> 40:48.543
You've got your head
in the clouds, Leslie.

40:48.615 --> 40:52.143
- Huh?
- There is no giant troll, all right?

40:52.219 --> 40:56.019
Well, you better not let
the Terabithians hear you.

40:56.090 --> 40:57.990
They thought you were their king.

41:12.273 --> 41:15.902
Alexandra, my daddy gave me Twinkies!

41:15.977 --> 41:19.209
Neither one squished, 'cause I
didn't put them next to my drink.

41:19.281 --> 41:21.112
I'd shut up about those Twinkies.

41:21.183 --> 41:23.947
You're just mad 'cause I
got some and you didn't.

41:24.019 --> 41:26.283
Whatever. Don't cry to me
when you lose them.

41:26.355 --> 41:27.913
I'll eat them, not lose them.

41:33.629 --> 41:36.462
Jess! Jess!

41:36.531 --> 41:40.592
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!
Janice Avery stole my Twinkies!

41:40.669 --> 41:44.504
- I told you, keep your mouth shut.
- She's there. What are you gonna do?

41:44.574 --> 41:46.769
And she makes you pay to pee!

41:48.177 --> 41:49.872
It's a dollar, shorty.

41:49.946 --> 41:53.643
But I don't have a dollar.

41:53.716 --> 41:57.277
That's not fair, is it?
Peeing's definitely supposed to be free.

41:57.353 --> 41:58.718
Free to pee!

41:58.788 --> 42:01.985
Free to pee! Free to pee! Free to pee!

42:04.927 --> 42:06.019
Let's go.

42:18.475 --> 42:20.807
I want my Twinkies, Janice Avery.

42:20.878 --> 42:22.812
What Twinkies, Twinkie?

42:24.114 --> 42:27.413
You're supposed to beat her up.
You're my brother!

42:27.484 --> 42:30.612
Do you know what would happen
if I were to pick a fight with her?

42:30.688 --> 42:32.883
You'll get your butt kicked.

42:32.956 --> 42:36.916
No, I'd get kicked out of school for
fighting a girl. What's that prove?

42:36.995 --> 42:39.725
She stole my Twinkies.

42:41.299 --> 42:43.062
Come on.

42:44.936 --> 42:46.767
It's all right, May Belle.

42:46.838 --> 42:50.706
We'll get her back. Won't we, Jess?

42:55.246 --> 42:58.044
<i>Don't let
the Terabithians hear you.</i>

42:58.116 --> 43:00.050
<i>They thought you were their king.</i>

43:20.239 --> 43:22.298
Jess! Jess!

43:32.786 --> 43:36.347
Oh... Hi! Look at you!

43:36.423 --> 43:41.190
That is your very own, certified,
purebred, giant troll hunter.

43:41.795 --> 43:43.228
- He's for me?
- Yeah,

43:43.296 --> 43:45.696
he just took a giant
pee all over my sweatshirt.

43:45.766 --> 43:48.234
Wow, Jess. Thank you.

43:52.706 --> 43:54.799
I name you Prince Terrien,

43:54.875 --> 43:57.777
giant troll hunter extraordinaire.

43:57.845 --> 43:59.813
P.T. For short.

44:03.384 --> 44:05.614
Hey! I think he smells a troll.
Come on.

44:09.056 --> 44:11.718
Oh, no! We've got company!

44:11.793 --> 44:13.988
Dead meat! Dead meat!

44:15.329 --> 44:17.889
- Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Hairy Vultures!

44:19.901 --> 44:21.563
What's that?

44:26.675 --> 44:29.439
It's a giant troll.

44:33.649 --> 44:35.014
Nice feet.

44:37.719 --> 44:39.050
Run!

44:42.024 --> 44:43.457
Oh, my gosh!

44:50.166 --> 44:52.293
I think we lost it.

44:54.337 --> 44:58.967
Leslie...

44:59.042 --> 45:01.636
- What's its weak spot?
- Does it have a weak spot?

45:01.711 --> 45:03.178
I don't know!

45:04.814 --> 45:08.011
Just making it madder!

45:08.618 --> 45:10.347
P.T.!

45:13.122 --> 45:15.717
That's it! That's its weak spot!

45:15.793 --> 45:17.727
It's ticklish!

45:19.230 --> 45:21.960
- Gross!
- Troll toe jam.

45:22.933 --> 45:25.128
Good boy, P.T. Good boy!

45:25.703 --> 45:27.330
Good dog.

45:33.210 --> 45:35.440
What's Janice's weak spot, you think?

45:37.314 --> 45:39.680
Eighth-grade girl...

45:39.750 --> 45:41.548
...probably eighth-grade boys.

45:41.620 --> 45:43.679
Who's she got a crush on?

45:43.755 --> 45:46.383
I don't know. Let's see...

45:46.458 --> 45:49.985
...coolest boy in
eighth grade is probably...

45:50.061 --> 45:51.619
...Willard Hughes.

45:51.696 --> 45:54.164
- That's it.
- What's it?

45:55.634 --> 45:58.501
Write, "Dear Janice... "

45:58.570 --> 46:01.232
- You do it.
- No way.

46:01.306 --> 46:03.831
Boys' handwriting sucks.
No offense.

46:03.909 --> 46:05.103
It's gotta be you.

46:07.546 --> 46:09.207
OK.

46:09.282 --> 46:11.250
"Dear Janice,

46:11.317 --> 46:14.844
<i>you're the most amazing and
beautiful person I've ever known. "</i>

46:14.921 --> 46:18.755
- How do I know which desk is hers?
- It's got dried-up blood and old bones.

46:23.162 --> 46:26.598
<i>"I do not know if you know this
about me, but I need to tell you,</i>

46:26.666 --> 46:30.067
<i>I think you are so cool.</i>

46:30.136 --> 46:34.005
You are the coolest over
all the other girls in our school. "

46:34.074 --> 46:35.598
OK. Write this,

46:35.676 --> 46:39.305
<i>"Let's find out if what
I think we have is real. "</i>

46:43.183 --> 46:45.413
- Oh, Mr. Bailey...
- Huh?

46:45.485 --> 46:48.943
...I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

46:49.022 --> 46:52.253
I think someone threw up
in the girls' room.

46:52.326 --> 46:54.521
All right, I'll take a look.

47:00.435 --> 47:03.336
"Meet me by the bus
after school today.

47:03.404 --> 47:06.669
We can ride home together
and talk about us. "

47:08.443 --> 47:11.105
<i>Underline and capitalize the "us. "</i>

47:11.179 --> 47:13.340
"All my love, Willard. "

47:16.551 --> 47:19.679
You know, if we get caught,
they're both gonna kill us.

47:29.531 --> 47:32.261
- I got your note.
- What are you talking about?

47:32.334 --> 47:33.926
That was really sweet.

47:34.003 --> 47:36.335
- I'm saving these seats.
- For who?

47:36.405 --> 47:39.169
Willard Hughes is gonna
ride Janice home today.

47:39.241 --> 47:42.005
- What are you talking about?
- Willard and Janice.

47:42.077 --> 47:44.272
They're totally in love.

47:44.346 --> 47:47.611
In your dreams.
Well, you better tell Willard that.

47:47.683 --> 47:50.049
It looks like he's
heading home in his own bus.

47:59.529 --> 48:01.429
Look at Janice!

48:05.268 --> 48:07.998
Hey, Janice, what happened?

48:08.071 --> 48:10.369
Didn't Willard know
he's in love with you?

48:13.076 --> 48:15.670
Where's
your boyfriend, Janice?

48:23.788 --> 48:27.315
- What just happened?
- He just walked away.

48:34.131 --> 48:36.224
- Yes.
- You wanna go?

48:36.300 --> 48:38.234
- Yeah.
- I wanna come.

48:38.302 --> 48:41.897
- You can't.
- It's a free country!

48:41.972 --> 48:45.272
Don't follow us, or I'll tell Alexandra
you still suck your thumb

48:45.343 --> 48:47.277
and sleep with Mr. Blanky.

48:49.815 --> 48:53.751
- So, what do you say?
- They must have finished their book.

48:53.819 --> 48:56.117
- How do you know?
- Hey, Leslie.

48:56.188 --> 48:58.782
- We need your help.
- Come on.

49:03.462 --> 49:06.363
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, Leslie, come on.

49:06.431 --> 49:08.626
All right, let's go.
We're on a mission.

49:08.700 --> 49:11.033
Hey, this is my friend, Jess.
Can he help?

49:11.104 --> 49:14.096
So, you're the infamous Jess.
Hi, I'm Judy.

49:14.173 --> 49:16.903
Leslie tells me you're good
with a paint brush.

49:16.976 --> 49:18.637
Grab one and get going.

49:18.711 --> 49:21.646
Come on! I am determined
to have this wall finished

49:21.714 --> 49:25.275
so when the late sun hits it,
we can watch it catch fire.

49:29.522 --> 49:33.720
Now, that's one steady hand, Jess.
That's an artist's hand. Am I right?

49:35.128 --> 49:36.686
Yeah.

49:36.996 --> 49:39.295
You know,
the best prize that life offers,

49:39.366 --> 49:42.130
is the chance to work hard
at work worth doing.

49:42.202 --> 49:44.261
Teddy Roosevelt said that, not me.

50:22.076 --> 50:26.012
- Wow.
- What did I tell you? Was it worth it?

50:54.210 --> 50:55.734
Hey, guys.

50:55.811 --> 50:58.303
Jess, get started on your homework, OK?

50:58.381 --> 51:01.009
I'm managing the store
on weekends, starting soon,

51:01.084 --> 51:03.848
I need you to pick up
on some chores around here.

51:03.920 --> 51:06.514
You know, the best prize
that life can offer

51:06.590 --> 51:09.457
is working hard at work worth doing.

51:24.242 --> 51:25.504
Hey...

51:27.712 --> 51:30.146
...have you taken art classes?

51:30.214 --> 51:33.615
No, I...
I just made them up myself.

51:33.684 --> 51:35.481
You're really talented.

51:38.823 --> 51:42.156
Jess, don't let those other kids
get in your way.

51:44.462 --> 51:47.727
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

51:52.170 --> 51:54.070
I just went to use the girl's room.

51:54.139 --> 51:56.437
Someone's in a stall,
crying their eyes out,

51:56.508 --> 51:58.669
and I think it's Janice Avery.

51:58.744 --> 52:00.712
It can't be the trick we played, can it?

52:00.779 --> 52:02.610
No way. But come here.

52:06.885 --> 52:08.716
Free to pee!

52:08.954 --> 52:10.945
Get out of here!

52:11.023 --> 52:14.481
Get out of here, now!

52:16.396 --> 52:19.331
- You should go talk to her.
- You kidding?

52:19.399 --> 52:22.766
It's not "skinned knee crying,"
it's something serious.

52:22.835 --> 52:25.201
It's the girls' bathroom,
I can't go in there.

52:25.271 --> 52:28.331
- I don't wanna go in there alone.
- What's the matter?

52:28.408 --> 52:32.367
A girl who can stand up to a giant troll
is afraid of some dumb eighth grader?

53:05.713 --> 53:06.975
Sorry.

53:07.047 --> 53:10.347
- Go on, tell me.
- No, I don't wanna tell you.

53:10.418 --> 53:12.943
- Why not?
- I'll tell you there.

53:16.858 --> 53:20.817
He, like, came up to me.
I'm pretty sure he likes me.

53:28.336 --> 53:30.964
No way! I like Tony!

53:34.977 --> 53:37.537
Her dad gets really mad at her.

53:37.613 --> 53:41.413
So? My dad gets mad at me...
pretty much all the time.

53:41.484 --> 53:43.748
- He hits her.
- Oh.

53:43.819 --> 53:47.812
Some neighbor heard them
yelling so loud, they called the police.

53:47.890 --> 53:52.020
And it got out. And all the seventh
and the eighth graders know about it.

53:52.094 --> 53:57.259
- Whoa.
- Which explains, like, a lot.

53:59.301 --> 54:02.567
Well, what did you say to her?

54:02.639 --> 54:06.166
Well, I told her about not having a TV

54:06.243 --> 54:08.143
and everyone laughing at me.

54:08.211 --> 54:11.203
I know what it's like
to have everyone think I was weird.

54:11.281 --> 54:13.272
Then what'd she say?

54:13.350 --> 54:15.511
She asked me for advice.

54:16.653 --> 54:18.587
Janice Avery asked you for advice?

54:18.655 --> 54:21.055
- Yeah.
- And?

54:21.124 --> 54:23.524
Well, I told her just to pretend

54:23.593 --> 54:26.721
that she had no idea
what anyone was talking about,

54:26.797 --> 54:31.599
and in a few weeks' time,
everybody would just forget about it.

54:31.669 --> 54:33.569
Man...

54:33.638 --> 54:35.265
Then I gave her a piece of gum.

54:36.641 --> 54:38.700
- We should go.
- Yeah.

54:39.677 --> 54:42.840
- Wanna come back tomorrow?
- Can't. I got chores.

54:42.914 --> 54:45.781
- How about the next day?
- Sunday we go to church.

54:45.850 --> 54:47.909
- Can I come?
- You'd hate it.

54:47.985 --> 54:51.512
- No, I think it'd be cool.
- Uh, girls can't wear pants.

54:51.589 --> 54:55.959
- I've got dresses, Jess.
- You in a dress? That'd be a sight!

54:56.562 --> 54:57.654
See ya!

55:48.983 --> 55:52.077
That's what we need.
Bells... in Terabithia.

55:57.057 --> 55:59.025
I'm really glad I came.

55:59.093 --> 56:01.994
That whole Jesus thing,
it's really interesting.

56:02.062 --> 56:04.428
It's not interesting.
It's scary!

56:04.498 --> 56:06.898
It's nailing holes through your hands.

56:06.967 --> 56:10.664
It's 'cause we're all vile sinners.
God made Jesus die.

56:10.738 --> 56:13.606
- You really think that's true?
- It's in the Bible.

56:14.142 --> 56:16.235
You have to believe it,
and you hate it.

56:16.878 --> 56:20.041
I don't have to believe it,
and I think it's beautiful.

56:20.115 --> 56:22.948
- You gotta believe the Bible, Leslie.
- Why?

56:23.018 --> 56:25.748
'Cause if you
don't believe in the Bible,

56:25.820 --> 56:27.981
God will damn you to hell when you die.

56:28.056 --> 56:30.251
Wow, May Belle.
Where'd you hear that?

56:30.325 --> 56:32.122
That's right, huh, Jess?

56:32.193 --> 56:36.391
God damns you to hell
if you don't believe in the Bible.

56:36.464 --> 56:38.933
- I think so.
- Well, I don't think so.

56:39.001 --> 56:42.835
I seriously do not think God
goes around damning people to hell.

56:42.905 --> 56:45.567
He's too busy running all this.

56:51.581 --> 56:54.516
Hey, Jess.
Give me a hand.

56:55.785 --> 56:57.720
Yeah. I'm coming.

56:59.655 --> 57:01.919
Get my drill out of the greenhouse.

57:20.510 --> 57:22.501
You haven't managed
to kill those yet?

57:22.579 --> 57:24.308
Not funny.

57:24.381 --> 57:25.575
Look.

57:26.216 --> 57:28.352
Ever thought of
putting them in the sun?

57:42.967 --> 57:45.435
Jess. Jess.

57:45.503 --> 57:48.768
- Where are my keys?
- What?

57:48.840 --> 57:51.775
My keys. You never gave them back to me.

57:59.685 --> 58:01.619
- Think!
- I put the drill down here.

58:01.687 --> 58:04.884
Damn it, the keys to the store
are on it, the register, all of it.

58:04.957 --> 58:07.983
They have to replace those locks,
$ 700 out of my paycheck.

58:08.060 --> 58:09.618
They gotta be right here.

58:09.695 --> 58:12.960
- If I don't have those keys...
- I'll find them, Dad. I promise.

58:13.032 --> 58:16.263
Why don't you draw me some money
to pay for it? How about that?

58:16.335 --> 58:18.530
Make yourself useful,
draw me some money.

58:18.604 --> 58:20.037
I said I'll find them.

58:24.811 --> 58:28.440
You look awful.
What's the matter?

58:28.515 --> 58:30.415
I lost the keys where my dad works,

58:30.483 --> 58:33.281
and now he has to get
new keys made, and locks.

58:33.353 --> 58:34.980
May Belle?

58:35.055 --> 58:37.455
Please don't anyone get mad at me.

58:37.524 --> 58:39.890
- What?
- He...

58:39.959 --> 58:43.190
- I know where your dad's keys are.
- You do?

58:43.863 --> 58:46.627
You know the bells
we talked about making?

58:46.700 --> 58:50.033
Well, it was meant to be a surprise.

58:50.103 --> 58:52.038
All that clanking metal and junk.

58:52.106 --> 58:54.768
And... May Belle wanted to help.

58:54.842 --> 58:56.366
And you let her?

58:57.912 --> 59:00.380
Why did you tell me
you found them on the ground?

59:00.448 --> 59:03.008
- They were.
- On the ground in the greenhouse.

59:03.084 --> 59:05.552
What's the matter with you?
Dad wants to kill me.

59:05.619 --> 59:08.213
I was waiting for the right time.

59:10.725 --> 59:12.693
So you know where the keys are?

59:23.271 --> 59:24.568
See ya later.

59:27.242 --> 59:30.507
- Tell Mom I'll be home in a bit.
- Are you gonna tell Dad it was me?

59:30.579 --> 59:33.946
Don't worry. It's my job
to get Dad's keys back. See you later.

59:41.690 --> 59:43.249
Whoa.

59:43.326 --> 59:46.489
Look how high it got.
Come on. Let's go.

59:51.334 --> 59:54.565
"Get your head out of the clouds, boy.
Draw me some money.

59:54.637 --> 59:58.198
- Make yourself useful, draw me money. "
- What are you going on about?

59:58.274 --> 01:00:01.334
"This isn't one of your cartoons.
This is serious. "

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:05.744
What's so great about being serious
all the time anyway? Tell me that.

01:00:11.121 --> 01:00:13.612
What if the Dark Master
gets the keys first?

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:16.921
I'm not scared of any Dark Master,
and those are my dad's keys.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:32.831
Leslie, get behind me.

01:00:35.212 --> 01:00:37.306
Jess, turn around. There's more.

01:00:38.616 --> 01:00:40.015
Here, take this.

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:45.612
Jess!

01:00:55.733 --> 01:00:56.961
P.T., get him!

01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:06.769
Good boy, P.T.

01:01:19.658 --> 01:01:20.682
Yeah!

01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:24.058
- Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!
- Whoa!

01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:28.024
Run!

01:01:28.869 --> 01:01:30.700
Come on! Faster!

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:33.671
Dead meat! Dead meat!

01:01:35.876 --> 01:01:37.173
Dead meat! Dead meat!

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:44.541
Told you they were grenades.

01:01:52.893 --> 01:01:54.019
Jess!

01:01:54.094 --> 01:01:55.824
I got you, Leslie!

01:01:56.764 --> 01:01:57.924
I got you!

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:01.401
Up ahead! Get ready!

01:02:06.507 --> 01:02:10.341
- They'll catch us.
- We're the fastest in Terabithia.

01:02:20.288 --> 01:02:21.950
He's watching us.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:27.357
Where are the keys?

01:02:27.429 --> 01:02:29.659
Here, open this.

01:02:42.344 --> 01:02:44.972
Where are Terabithian warriors
when you need them?

01:02:45.047 --> 01:02:46.912
I don't know.

01:02:50.553 --> 01:02:52.646
Great. Now there's three of us.

01:02:59.529 --> 01:03:02.157
- Wow.
- Now we're even.

01:03:02.231 --> 01:03:03.664
Attack!

01:03:12.875 --> 01:03:17.108
Dead meat! Dead meat!
Dead meat! Dead meat! Dead meat!

01:03:18.615 --> 01:03:19.604
Come on.

01:03:20.284 --> 01:03:23.720
- Come on, P.T.
- Dead meat!

01:03:46.411 --> 01:03:48.936
Be careful!
You're almost there.

01:03:56.187 --> 01:03:58.519
Jess!

01:03:59.057 --> 01:04:00.319
Jess!

01:04:18.644 --> 01:04:19.770
Hey.

01:05:09.797 --> 01:05:11.856
- See ya!
- Yeah, see ya.

01:06:02.485 --> 01:06:05.010
Jess! I called you three times.

01:06:05.088 --> 01:06:06.316
It's your girlfriend.

01:06:06.389 --> 01:06:08.482
She's not my girlfriend.

01:06:09.559 --> 01:06:11.686
<i>- Hey.
- Hello, Jess.</i>

01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:13.786
Wait. Who is this?

01:06:13.863 --> 01:06:16.491
It's Saturday, but it's
your teacher, Ms. Edmunds.

01:06:16.566 --> 01:06:20.970
I was planning on taking my nephews
into the city to the museum,

01:06:21.038 --> 01:06:24.940
and my sister changed her plans
last minute, so I had a thought.

01:06:29.413 --> 01:06:32.211
- Hey, Mom.
- Hmm? Is it the baby?

01:06:32.283 --> 01:06:35.013
No, she's fine.
May Belle's got her.

01:06:35.085 --> 01:06:38.612
Teacher wants me to go
on a field trip today.

01:06:38.689 --> 01:06:41.487
- Is that OK?
- Mmm.

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:47.697
Ms. Edmunds? Yeah, I can go.

01:06:55.941 --> 01:06:57.704
- All set?
- Yeah.

01:06:57.776 --> 01:06:59.175
- Yeah?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:07:06.451 --> 01:07:08.385
Forget something?

01:07:10.355 --> 01:07:12.688
No. I'm good.

01:07:48.895 --> 01:07:50.590
Wow.

01:07:55.936 --> 01:07:57.597
Honey, honey, stay here.

01:08:00.841 --> 01:08:03.402
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

01:08:03.478 --> 01:08:06.572
It's Brueghel.
It's one of my favorites.

01:08:06.648 --> 01:08:10.015
I wonder if he started in notebooks
like you. I know da Vinci did.

01:08:14.822 --> 01:08:17.916
It's amazing how much
detail's put into it.

01:08:17.992 --> 01:08:20.323
You've been to a museum before, right?

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:23.831
- No, it's my first time.
- Really?

01:08:23.898 --> 01:08:26.627
- Yup.
- Well, then I'm honored.

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:08.040
It's such a nice day out.

01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:12.411
It's been raining so much, I began
to think it was like that Japanese myth

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:16.475
where the sun goes into the cave
and vows never to come out.

01:09:16.553 --> 01:09:19.783
- You know about everything.
- Not by a long shot.

01:09:19.856 --> 01:09:21.881
But I do try to keep an open mind,

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.553
and you'd be surprised
what finds its way in there.

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:28.291
That's what Leslie Burke says.
She told me to keep my mind wide open.

01:09:28.366 --> 01:09:30.027
Leslie Burke is right.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:33.764
Mind like yours wide open,
you could create a whole new world.

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:45.513
- Thank you very much.
- You're very welcome.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:49.212
- Maybe we could do this again sometime.
- Absolutely.

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:56.493
- Hey, guys.
- See? I told you.

01:09:56.561 --> 01:09:58.620
Oh, my God, Jess!

01:10:00.298 --> 01:10:03.563
- Where in God's name have you been?
- Where have you been?

01:10:04.736 --> 01:10:07.068
Mom...

01:10:07.139 --> 01:10:09.630
I asked you. It wasn't like I...

01:10:09.708 --> 01:10:12.404
- They thought you were dead.
- Brenda, hush.

01:10:12.477 --> 01:10:14.274
Dead?

01:10:15.481 --> 01:10:17.244
What's going on?

01:10:24.023 --> 01:10:26.423
Your friend Leslie's dead.

01:10:28.261 --> 01:10:30.092
She drowned in a creek this morning.

01:10:30.163 --> 01:10:33.792
Apparently she tried to swing
across on a rope and it broke.

01:10:33.866 --> 01:10:36.096
They think she hit her head.

01:10:37.937 --> 01:10:41.396
No... No, it's not that kind of rope.

01:10:41.475 --> 01:10:45.104
It couldn't break.
It... wouldn't have.

01:10:45.179 --> 01:10:47.204
But it did.

01:10:50.484 --> 01:10:54.113
- I'm sorry, son.
- No, you're lying.

01:10:55.022 --> 01:10:59.049
- She's not even dead. You're lying!
- Jess!

01:12:33.357 --> 01:12:36.622
Hi, honey. You want some breakfast?

01:12:36.694 --> 01:12:39.458
I... I gotta do my chores first.

01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:42.294
Your dad's doing everything today.
You just sit down.

01:12:58.317 --> 01:13:00.080
Jess, your father and I thought

01:13:00.152 --> 01:13:02.814
we'd go to the Burkes today
and pay our respects.

01:13:02.888 --> 01:13:05.220
Just the three of us.

01:13:06.258 --> 01:13:07.691
Paying what?

01:13:29.148 --> 01:13:30.911
Prince Terrien. Shh.

01:13:31.818 --> 01:13:33.752
You must be Jess.

01:13:42.962 --> 01:13:47.696
I'm Mr. Aarons. This is my wife, Mary.
Very sorry about your loss.

01:13:47.768 --> 01:13:50.293
- I'm so sorry.
- Hi, Jess.

01:13:58.312 --> 01:14:00.303
She loved you, you know.

01:14:01.315 --> 01:14:02.805
You know, Leslie,

01:14:02.883 --> 01:14:06.842
she never had much luck
making friends at her old school.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.253
We were hoping that when
we moved out here she would...

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:16.930
She said
if it wasn't for you...

01:14:19.334 --> 01:14:21.598
You're the best friend she's ever had.

01:14:21.670 --> 01:14:23.638
I wanna thank you for that.

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:27.199
You're welcome.

01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:33.303
My wife and I were wondering
about the service.

01:14:36.851 --> 01:14:40.447
We've decided to bring Leslie
back home until the service.

01:14:46.195 --> 01:14:50.188
- Jess.
- Next time,

01:14:50.266 --> 01:14:53.258
we should invite Leslie to go.

01:14:55.137 --> 01:14:57.332
She'd like that.

01:15:06.817 --> 01:15:08.341
Hey, kid.

01:15:09.786 --> 01:15:11.947
Sorry about your friend.

01:15:14.424 --> 01:15:18.952
The purpose
of object pronouns...

01:15:19.029 --> 01:15:22.157
So looks like you're
the fastest kid in the class now, huh?

01:15:24.534 --> 01:15:26.627
It's a joke, dude.

01:15:31.209 --> 01:15:33.234
- Are you nuts?
- Jess Aarons.

01:15:33.845 --> 01:15:35.938
Go wait for me out in the hall.

01:15:37.381 --> 01:15:39.815
Silent reading until I get back.

01:15:49.193 --> 01:15:50.922
Jess...

01:15:57.603 --> 01:16:00.504
When my husband died...

01:16:00.572 --> 01:16:03.564
...people kept telling me not to cry.

01:16:04.676 --> 01:16:07.076
People kept trying to help me to forget.

01:16:10.382 --> 01:16:12.714
But I didn't wanna forget.

01:16:12.785 --> 01:16:15.117
Excuse me.

01:16:17.890 --> 01:16:20.484
The things that girl came up with.

01:16:22.528 --> 01:16:25.123
I don't get students like her too often.

01:16:29.702 --> 01:16:32.170
So I realize...

01:16:32.238 --> 01:16:34.968
...that if it's hard for me...

01:16:35.041 --> 01:16:37.566
...how much harder it must be for you.

01:17:25.193 --> 01:17:27.354
Hurry up.
We're gonna miss the bus!

01:17:36.738 --> 01:17:38.501
Hey.

01:18:25.689 --> 01:18:27.748
Leslie?!

01:18:52.483 --> 01:18:54.610
Jess!

01:18:54.686 --> 01:18:56.210
Leslie!

01:18:56.287 --> 01:18:59.723
- Jess!
- Leslie!

01:19:06.198 --> 01:19:07.825
Lesl...

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:10.892
Help me, I can't get across! Hurry!

01:19:12.104 --> 01:19:14.072
May Belle?

01:19:16.508 --> 01:19:18.703
Hold on! Don't move!

01:19:20.346 --> 01:19:22.837
Here, grab my arm.
I got you, don't worry.

01:19:28.188 --> 01:19:30.748
- What were you thinking?
- I was worried about you!

01:19:30.824 --> 01:19:33.622
Well, don't be. I don't want you here!

01:19:34.227 --> 01:19:37.025
- But I wanna come with you.
- This is our place. Go home.

01:19:37.097 --> 01:19:38.962
This is our place!

01:19:43.103 --> 01:19:44.468
I said go home!

01:19:59.587 --> 01:20:01.452
Honey, what's the matter?

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:04.391
What's the matter?

01:20:04.458 --> 01:20:06.392
What's the matter, baby?

01:21:11.060 --> 01:21:12.789
No!

01:21:14.364 --> 01:21:16.093
Jess!

01:21:17.101 --> 01:21:19.865
It's OK, Jess.
It's OK, son, it's OK.

01:21:19.937 --> 01:21:21.734
It's all gone.

01:21:25.209 --> 01:21:27.677
Is it like the Bible says?

01:21:27.744 --> 01:21:29.644
Is she going to hell?

01:21:30.347 --> 01:21:32.144
I don't know everything about God,

01:21:32.216 --> 01:21:35.083
but I do know He's not
gonna send that little girl to hell.

01:21:35.152 --> 01:21:38.519
Then I'm going to hell
because it's all my fault.

01:21:38.589 --> 01:21:42.287
Don't you think that even for a minute.

01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:44.988
But it is.

01:21:45.063 --> 01:21:49.295
I didn't invite her
to go to the museum with me.

01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:52.700
I didn't wanna invite her.

01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:56.069
I wasn't there to go with her.

01:21:56.141 --> 01:21:59.269
- It's my fault.
- No, no, no, no.

01:21:59.344 --> 01:22:01.505
It's not your fault.

01:22:01.579 --> 01:22:04.207
None of that makes it so.

01:22:04.282 --> 01:22:06.478
It's a terrible thing.

01:22:06.552 --> 01:22:11.182
It doesn't make any sense,
but it's not your fault, Jess.

01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:19.891
She brought you something special
when she came here, didn't she?

01:22:23.068 --> 01:22:25.468
That's what you hold on to.

01:22:28.541 --> 01:22:31.032
That's how you keep her alive.

01:22:51.298 --> 01:22:52.629
May Belle?

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:02.740
Look.

01:23:04.545 --> 01:23:06.410
I'm sorry I pushed you.

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:11.881
That was stupid and wrong...

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:16.081
...and I really miss you talking to me.

01:23:56.499 --> 01:23:58.933
She's in your hands now.

01:24:22.192 --> 01:24:23.318
Hey!

01:24:25.162 --> 01:24:26.424
Wait!

01:24:28.499 --> 01:24:29.523
Wait!

01:24:31.835 --> 01:24:33.234
Hey!

01:24:39.176 --> 01:24:42.236
Jess? I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't see you.

01:24:42.313 --> 01:24:46.080
Can I use the lumber by your house?

01:24:46.151 --> 01:24:47.846
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

01:24:47.919 --> 01:24:50.649
Anything you see, you just...

01:24:51.523 --> 01:24:54.890
You know, I meant to...
I meant to give you Prince Terrien,

01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:58.190
but I... can't seem to give him up.

01:25:00.031 --> 01:25:02.090
Leslie would've wanted you to have him.

01:25:02.167 --> 01:25:03.725
Yeah.

01:26:27.221 --> 01:26:30.589
We're playing. By ourselves.

01:26:32.127 --> 01:26:36.086
OK, but I know the most
incredible place to play.

01:26:36.165 --> 01:26:39.225
You gotta promise you're
not gonna tell anybody about it.

01:26:39.301 --> 01:26:43.431
Not Brenda, not Ellie, not even Joycie.

01:26:43.505 --> 01:26:47.100
Tell Joycie a secret between you and me?

01:26:47.176 --> 01:26:48.700
She's nothing but a baby.

01:26:48.777 --> 01:26:52.042
You're right, and she's not ready
to be a princess yet.

01:26:52.114 --> 01:26:53.979
You have to train her and stuff.

01:26:54.049 --> 01:26:57.076
Princess? Who gets to be the princess?

01:27:06.863 --> 01:27:08.592
Step down.

01:27:12.068 --> 01:27:13.467
Watch your step.

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:22.808
You're not peeking, are you?

01:27:24.915 --> 01:27:27.713
Step up. There you go.

01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:36.922
All right.

01:27:43.367 --> 01:27:45.335
OK. Open them.

01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:55.170
Wow. Did you make this?

01:27:56.615 --> 01:27:58.310
Yep.

01:28:01.152 --> 01:28:02.949
Hold on a second.

01:28:11.630 --> 01:28:14.998
Look! They must've heard the rumor,

01:28:15.067 --> 01:28:19.834
that the beautiful girl arriving today
is the new future ruler of Terabithia.

01:28:19.906 --> 01:28:23.239
- Who heard?
- The Terabithians.

01:28:23.309 --> 01:28:25.573
They've been waiting.

01:28:25.645 --> 01:28:27.636
Where?

01:28:27.713 --> 01:28:31.171
- I don't see them.
- It's an ancient forest, May Belle,

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:33.650
full of magical creatures
and friendly giants,

01:28:33.719 --> 01:28:36.017
anything you can imagine.

01:28:36.088 --> 01:28:38.056
But you gotta look really hard.

01:28:38.124 --> 01:28:41.026
But keep your mind wide open.

01:28:49.670 --> 01:28:51.501
So, what do you think?

01:28:55.909 --> 01:28:58.343
Can there be purple flowers?

01:29:00.447 --> 01:29:02.881
Anything you want.

01:29:03.850 --> 01:29:05.841
Wow.

01:29:07.255 --> 01:29:08.552
And a castle.

01:29:08.623 --> 01:29:11.421
A big one, with towers and flags.

01:29:11.492 --> 01:29:13.824
Of course.

01:29:16.631 --> 01:29:19.464
Look, Jess. It's beautiful.

01:29:23.371 --> 01:29:25.066
Is there a king?

01:29:25.139 --> 01:29:26.572
Are you the king, Jess?

01:29:26.641 --> 01:29:29.235
Only if you're princess.

01:30:14.824 --> 01:30:17.190
Terabithia.
