01:39.020 --> 01:41.059
Boy, is that ever incendiary, right?

01:41.060 --> 01:42.699
Jesus Christ.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.020
Yes, it is.

01:47.220 --> 01:49.179
That's just an outrage.

01:49.180 --> 01:51.099
That's just a fucking outrage.

01:55.059 --> 01:58.578
Hey, how are you?
Er, we just got the autopsy report.

01:58.579 --> 02:01.059
Give me your fax number
so I can fax it to you.

02:02.699 --> 02:04.258
Yes, ma'am.

02:04.259 --> 02:05.699
Right.

02:06.739 --> 02:11.498
8722. I'll fax it right now
and then, er...

02:11.499 --> 02:12.739
I'll call you back.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.299
Oh, Jesus!

02:19.859 --> 02:21.697
Me again.

02:21.698 --> 02:25.617
I'm going to fax...uh,
we just got the autopsy report.

02:25.618 --> 02:28.737
Can I fax it to you?
Are you at your office?

02:28.738 --> 02:31.217
I have to go back to court at 2.30,

02:31.218 --> 02:34.857
and the press is trying
to unseal this thing,

02:34.858 --> 02:38.098
so I need to talk with you some
before 2.30.

02:39.418 --> 02:43.377
OK. I'll get it to you right away.

02:43.378 --> 02:45.298
Thank you. Bye-bye.

02:48.378 --> 02:52.296
Hey. I got this autopsy
on this Germany thing.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.736
As soon as you take a look at it,
would you call me?

02:55.737 --> 02:59.136
Well, they concluded these injuries
were as a result

02:59.137 --> 03:03.817
of a homicidal attack, so I need
for you to take a look at this.

03:06.337 --> 03:08.337
MUTTERING

03:10.177 --> 03:13.216
I mean, I've read... How many
autopsies we read? Never seen that.

03:13.217 --> 03:14.337
Never.

03:15.857 --> 03:19.617
Hi, is John around, please?
Thank you.

03:20.816 --> 03:22.255
Dave Rudolf.

03:22.256 --> 03:24.375
I've got a question for you.

03:24.376 --> 03:29.295
I've read 260 autopsies
from blunt trauma to the head

03:29.296 --> 03:32.935
and never once did I see
any of your people say,

03:32.936 --> 03:37.975
"The inflicted trauma is clearly
from a homicidal assault."

03:37.976 --> 03:39.576
Um...

03:42.096 --> 03:47.055
All right, well, could you
call me back after you get done?

03:47.056 --> 03:49.216
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks.

03:54.175 --> 03:56.175
Outrageous.

04:02.895 --> 04:08.494
I just know that, um,
my mom died in '85.

04:08.495 --> 04:13.335
Think it was the winter of '85,
and, um...

04:14.935 --> 04:16.733
..she...she...

04:16.735 --> 04:19.214
I know that she died
of a brain haemorrhage.

04:19.214 --> 04:21.452
She had been having
many headaches before.

04:21.454 --> 04:24.373
I mean, there's people...
many people have said this,

04:24.374 --> 04:27.493
that she called her mother,
complaining of headaches.

04:27.494 --> 04:30.893
She hated doctors.
Like, I don't like doctors either.

04:30.894 --> 04:33.013
Neither does Martha.

04:33.014 --> 04:37.653
Um...so she didn't want to go see
one, no matter how much, you know...

04:37.654 --> 04:42.373
Mike and Patty, I guess,
told her to go

04:42.374 --> 04:45.693
and she basically died

04:45.694 --> 04:48.933
before she even hit
the bottom of the stairs

04:48.934 --> 04:52.772
and I-I think it's interesting,
you know,

04:52.773 --> 04:56.012
that they both were found
at the bottom of the stairs,

04:56.013 --> 04:57.772
but at the same time,

04:57.773 --> 05:01.292
the two things they had in common
besides being my mothers were

05:01.293 --> 05:04.932
that Dad loved them both
very, very, very much,

05:04.933 --> 05:08.532
and he would have never,
ever hurt either of them,

05:08.533 --> 05:13.252
so I think that's what they have in
common more than anything malicious.

05:13.253 --> 05:15.172
So...

05:15.173 --> 05:17.572
The autopsy report released
this afternoon

05:17.573 --> 05:20.332
details how this
woman died more than a decade ago.

05:20.333 --> 05:24.131
The Ratliff autopsy report says
her fatal wounds appear to be

05:24.132 --> 05:26.611
the result of several blows
to the head,

05:26.612 --> 05:29.731
injuries that happened
while Ratliff was still alive.

05:29.732 --> 05:33.211
The conclusion - those injuries
came from a homicidal assault.

05:33.212 --> 05:35.891
That's inflammatory.
That's not a doctor...

05:35.892 --> 05:37.971
That's what a jury determines.

05:37.972 --> 05:40.011
Now the Peterson defence team

05:40.012 --> 05:43.771
hopes this report will not prejudice
a potential jury.

05:43.772 --> 05:46.371
All right,
it gets curioser and curioser.

05:46.372 --> 05:49.211
You can read the entire
autopsy report on our website

05:49.212 --> 05:50.971
at abc11tv.com.

05:55.011 --> 05:58.730
I've had one of my biggest fuckings
in court ever.

05:58.731 --> 06:01.450
The judge unsealed all this stuff,

06:01.451 --> 06:03.850
you know, this new autopsy.

06:03.851 --> 06:07.810
The headlines tonight are,
"Homicidal Assault".

06:07.811 --> 06:09.650
Just outrageous.

06:09.651 --> 06:12.730
Anyway, I think I'm going to need
to call these people

06:12.731 --> 06:15.330
as witnesses on Wednesday,
and I think I'm going to need

06:15.331 --> 06:18.450
your presence here
to help me cross-examine them.

06:18.451 --> 06:22.729
Yeah, and we're going to have...
you know, I'm going to have

06:22.730 --> 06:26.569
to cross-examine them pretty
vigorously, I think, so... Yes.

06:26.570 --> 06:28.649
Yes, I want you to be there
when he testifies

06:28.650 --> 06:30.210
so that we can cross-examine him.

06:31.210 --> 06:33.769
All right?

06:33.770 --> 06:36.409
Well, if this is admitted
the way it stands,

06:36.410 --> 06:39.689
the one we got from the medical
examiner, will that hurt your case?

06:39.690 --> 06:42.089
Well, keep in mind it's not...
This doesn't get admitted.

06:42.090 --> 06:45.809
Somebody's going to have to get up
on the witness stand and testify,

06:45.810 --> 06:49.289
and that's really the unfairness
of this current procedure -

06:49.290 --> 06:52.528
what gets released
to the public right now

06:52.529 --> 06:56.608
is simply a one-sided report
that we haven't had

06:56.609 --> 06:58.768
a chance to ask any questions about,

06:58.769 --> 07:04.008
and I think that's part of the
problem here is that all that

07:04.009 --> 07:07.968
gets put into the news media is,
you know,

07:07.969 --> 07:14.728
a fairly inflammatory statement
that is completely unnecessary

07:14.729 --> 07:20.008
to the autopsy findings, and were
just sort of gratuitous, and,

07:20.009 --> 07:21.847
you know, I don't blame you guys.

07:21.848 --> 07:23.367
It was put in there because

07:23.368 --> 07:26.247
that's exactly what you guys
would gravitate to.

07:26.248 --> 07:30.207
Those aren't really lined up the
way... They're not anything like...

07:30.208 --> 07:33.127
They are, interestingly enough,
mainly curved in some way.

07:33.128 --> 07:34.927
I don't know
the significance of that.

07:34.928 --> 07:37.567
This one, this one, this one,
curved...

07:37.568 --> 07:42.047
This is kind of curved with a split.
Kathleen's or...

07:42.048 --> 07:44.567
It's almost like something...

07:44.568 --> 07:47.607
I don't know what caused
this curvature, for example.

07:47.608 --> 07:49.927
Is that indicative of something?

07:49.928 --> 07:55.687
Can only Kathleen...? Let's get
her... Let's get her autopsy.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.287
That... That's the same?

08:08.127 --> 08:09.886
The truth is,
these are spread out more.

08:09.887 --> 08:11.246
You've got the top of the head,

08:11.247 --> 08:13.206
you've got the hair,
you've got the left...

08:13.207 --> 08:15.966
Oh, yeah, you've also got bruising
on the back of the neck,

08:15.967 --> 08:17.846
which would be indicative of...

08:17.847 --> 08:19.366
Falling. Falling, right.

08:19.367 --> 08:22.645
The top... How do you bang someone
in the top of the head? What?

08:22.646 --> 08:26.685
You know, this is supposed
to be a signature thing.

08:26.686 --> 08:30.805
You know, there's supposed to be
some way in which these are similar.

08:30.806 --> 08:32.245
How does one...

08:32.246 --> 08:33.365
Other than the fact

08:33.366 --> 08:36.366
that they're both found
at the bottom of stairs...

08:55.245 --> 08:58.324
You get a false impression,
I think a misleading impression...

08:58.325 --> 08:59.724
Yeah, I was surprised

08:59.725 --> 09:03.364
when I saw the photographs
how close together they were.

09:03.365 --> 09:07.924
Those look like pattern injuries
or crescent-shaped things

09:07.925 --> 09:09.564
from some sort of instrument.

09:09.565 --> 09:12.844
When you look at the photographs,
I don't get that impression at all.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.005
No, no, not at all.

09:27.284 --> 09:30.843
Yeah, looking at the sketch, this...
it doesn't work for me.

09:30.844 --> 09:34.163
I mean, the pictures,
that's the work of...

09:34.164 --> 09:36.243
The sketch is just simply that,

09:36.244 --> 09:42.964
but I don't think they truly reflect
very well what is in these pictures.

09:46.524 --> 09:48.923
Here. The correspondence...

09:48.924 --> 09:52.722
I mean, if that's what they're
relying on to reconstruct

09:52.723 --> 09:56.242
and to draw conclusions on...
this is very misleading.

09:56.243 --> 09:58.522
The diagram is very misleading.
Cos of...

09:58.523 --> 10:03.082
These look like they're linear,
linear and simple.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.642
These are not simple.

10:04.643 --> 10:08.802
They're very complex,
and when you do this sort of thing,

10:08.803 --> 10:13.762
what sort of impacts produce
scalp lacerations like that?

10:13.763 --> 10:17.082
Yeah. Probably not blows. I mean,
what instrument would do that?

10:17.083 --> 10:18.842
Ah, I see.

10:18.843 --> 10:24.281
These are more characteristic of
impacts where the skin just splits.

10:24.282 --> 10:25.602
Right.

10:27.442 --> 10:30.081
Well, the hearing tomorrow,
on Ratliff,

10:30.082 --> 10:33.281
I think is probably
the most important hearing,

10:33.282 --> 10:37.121
may very well be
the most important day in court

10:37.122 --> 10:39.561
that we have in this entire case.

10:39.562 --> 10:43.601
I think that the evidence
about the death in Germany,

10:43.602 --> 10:45.561
if it comes in,

10:45.562 --> 10:49.761
will have a substantial impact
even subconsciously

10:49.762 --> 10:53.960
on how the jurors
evaluate the evidence in this case,

10:53.961 --> 10:56.840
even though there's not
a shred of evidence that Michael

10:56.841 --> 11:00.640
had anything to do with
Elizabeth Ratliff's death.

11:00.641 --> 11:04.800
The mere fact that it comes
in evidence will have an impact,

11:04.801 --> 11:09.720
so my view is that
if we win the motion tomorrow

11:09.721 --> 11:14.000
and keep the Ratliff evidence out,
because it's not relevant,

11:14.001 --> 11:16.120
this is not a technicality...

11:16.121 --> 11:17.800
Because it's not relevant

11:17.801 --> 11:21.119
and because the state
can't show that it's relevant,

11:21.120 --> 11:24.439
we will have a very good chance
of winning this trial,

11:24.440 --> 11:29.360
because the rest of the evidence,
I think, is pretty minimal.

11:40.560 --> 11:45.759
Well, what we've done is
we've subpoenaed their witnesses,

11:45.760 --> 11:49.879
some of the doctors
who have done the autopsies,

11:49.880 --> 11:54.558
and we want to put them on the stand
and force them to do more

11:54.559 --> 11:57.198
than just give
their bare conclusions.

11:57.199 --> 11:59.878
Their reports are very bare bones.

11:59.879 --> 12:03.358
What we want to do is we want
to get them on the stand and be able

12:03.359 --> 12:08.398
to ask them the hard questions that
they don't address in their reports

12:08.399 --> 12:13.239
to show that the basis of
their conclusions is simply flawed.

12:15.079 --> 12:19.118
This is the kind of evidence
that can really prejudice and taint

12:19.119 --> 12:21.597
a trial unfairly.

12:21.598 --> 12:23.557
It's the kind of evidence

12:23.558 --> 12:28.158
that courts have traditionally said
you just don't let in.

12:31.678 --> 12:36.118
In my opinion, the '85 death...

12:37.758 --> 12:41.357
If the state try to introduce
evidence of that in the court,

12:41.358 --> 12:43.637
it could come in any number of ways

12:43.638 --> 12:46.797
for which I will listen
to arguments about...

12:46.798 --> 12:48.397
Has the state filed

12:48.398 --> 12:53.236
a motion to have the court consider
Miss Ratliff's death?

12:53.237 --> 12:56.396
We are not a proponent
of that evidence at this point,

12:56.397 --> 13:02.236
and will not be until the court
actually is involved in this trial

13:02.237 --> 13:05.596
and begins hearing evidence
of all these matters.

13:05.597 --> 13:11.956
Judge, um...two weeks ago, or
three weeks ago, you sat there

13:11.957 --> 13:16.796
and agreed that this was an issue,
particularly Ratliff...

13:16.797 --> 13:18.156
It is an issue.

13:18.157 --> 13:20.076
Well, that has to be decided

13:20.077 --> 13:23.275
before jury selection
for very good reasons.

13:23.276 --> 13:25.795
I'm not aware of any law that...

13:25.796 --> 13:29.275
that the court can direct the state
to do it.

13:29.276 --> 13:32.675
No, what the court can...
I mean, I can...I can...

13:32.676 --> 13:35.235
I'm not sure there's
a North Carolina state law

13:35.236 --> 13:36.595
that the court can order

13:36.596 --> 13:39.395
the state to do something. I don't
think you can order them to do that.

13:39.396 --> 13:42.715
What you can do is say, "If you
don't file the notice and have

13:42.716 --> 13:47.355
"the hearing today, you're not going
to be allowed to introduce

13:47.356 --> 13:51.594
"that evidence, because
it's prejudicial to the defence."

13:51.595 --> 13:54.914
Let's just look at this
from a practical perspective.

13:54.915 --> 13:57.394
If I don't know whether or not
that's coming in.

13:57.395 --> 13:58.794
I've got to assume it is.

13:58.795 --> 14:02.554
And therefore I'm going to spend
lots of time in opening statement

14:02.555 --> 14:05.834
talking to the jurors about that,
finding out what they think

14:05.835 --> 14:08.874
and talking about the facts
and all of that stuff.

14:08.875 --> 14:13.034
So now all of a sudden,
Mr Hardin says, "Judge, I'm sorry,

14:13.035 --> 14:15.714
"we're not going to introduce,"
right?

14:15.715 --> 14:19.154
Now, are you going to instruct
the jury to disregard everything

14:19.155 --> 14:22.593
that I said in my opening statement?

14:22.594 --> 14:24.473
How is that...

14:24.474 --> 14:29.073
How are you going to instruct them
to disregard what I said and have me

14:29.074 --> 14:33.633
maintain my credibility with a jury
that is deciding my client's life?

14:33.634 --> 14:37.513
I believe, frankly, it would be
ineffective assistance to counsel

14:37.514 --> 14:39.633
for him not to deal with it,

14:39.634 --> 14:42.433
whether the evidence
is admissible or not,

14:42.434 --> 14:46.753
because it's out there, the news
media has spent three or four days

14:46.754 --> 14:51.472
using the same footage
of the exhumation down in Texas.

14:51.473 --> 14:54.672
It's still going on
up until this morning,

14:54.673 --> 14:58.712
which raises another question
about all of these interviews that

14:58.713 --> 15:02.512
Mr Rudolf likes to give
to the media about the evidence.

15:02.513 --> 15:06.752
My client's wanted this trial
to proceed for a long time.

15:06.753 --> 15:13.432
The DA delayed that exhumation
for months and months and months.

15:13.433 --> 15:18.952
Now, two weeks before, or three
weeks before trial, he decides

15:18.953 --> 15:24.551
to go ahead with an exhumation,
and that is simply unfair.

15:24.552 --> 15:28.751
He did it intentionally, he did it
knowingly. He stands here

15:28.752 --> 15:34.551
and talks sanctimoniously about
how I'm talking to the press

15:34.552 --> 15:38.271
in response to a
medical examiner's report...

15:38.272 --> 15:40.231
I knew you would bring that up.
Yeah...

15:40.232 --> 15:46.551
..that gratuitously uses the term
"homicidal attack", or "assault".

15:46.552 --> 15:50.790
And I'm supposed to sit back
and allow my client to be prejudiced

15:50.791 --> 15:56.151
by that and buy this show
that he's put together...

15:57.431 --> 15:59.631
..and just sit back and do nothing?

16:03.271 --> 16:07.630
The court declines Mr Rudolf
and his discretion to determine

16:07.631 --> 16:13.991
the admissibility of the death
of Miss Ratliff...

16:16.791 --> 16:18.230
..today,

16:18.231 --> 16:22.029
and pre-trial, court in its
discretion

16:22.030 --> 16:26.589
will rule on its
admissibility when proffered

16:26.590 --> 16:32.189
by the state of North Carolina as
evidence of this particular case.

16:32.190 --> 16:36.189
You know, I subpoenaed
all three medical examiners

16:36.190 --> 16:40.389
and was prepared to cross-examine
all of them. Today. Today!

16:40.390 --> 16:44.269
So why is it that it's OK for them

16:44.270 --> 16:50.308
to write reports that have
conclusions like "homicidal assault"

16:50.309 --> 16:54.628
and yet not have to get up
on a witness stand today?

16:54.629 --> 16:56.428
What is his sexual preference?

16:56.429 --> 16:59.348
What is whose sexual preference,
Mr Hardin's? The client's.

16:59.349 --> 17:03.108
Not Mr Hardin's! Oh, I don't know
what Mr Hardin's is. You know...

17:03.109 --> 17:06.068
Would you really expect...
What's your sexual... Come on!

17:06.069 --> 17:08.268
No, your guy's on trial - I'm not.

17:08.269 --> 17:09.708
Well, we can change that.

17:09.709 --> 17:12.229
No, I'm not going to answer
those kind of questions. OK.

17:29.868 --> 17:33.227
INAUDIBLE

17:33.228 --> 17:36.667
Well, wherever's...

17:36.668 --> 17:39.187
Get me a Diet Coke...

17:39.188 --> 17:40.748
BARKING

17:43.228 --> 17:45.267
Where the hell's your silverware?

17:45.268 --> 17:50.786
Er, on the right,
in the top...second drawer.

17:50.787 --> 17:54.626
I keep the pans and the other stuff
in the top drawer.

17:54.627 --> 17:57.906
INAUDIBLE

17:57.907 --> 18:03.346
There is no doubt in my mind
that those two guys knew exactly

18:03.347 --> 18:08.026
what was going to happen
before that hearing started.

18:08.027 --> 18:11.466
I mean, the little speech
that Orlando did at the beginning,

18:11.467 --> 18:17.266
you know, Hardin... He didn't say to
Hardin, "What are you talking about?

18:17.267 --> 18:19.426
"We're here for a hearing!"

18:19.427 --> 18:21.145
You know? Er...

18:21.146 --> 18:23.665
"What do you mean, you don't think
we ought to go forward?

18:23.666 --> 18:28.305
"I mean, on Monday we sat here
for three...all day talking about

18:28.306 --> 18:30.385
"whether this hearing
should be closed or not -

18:30.386 --> 18:31.825
"you didn't say anything then!"

18:31.826 --> 18:35.665
I just don't understand it. I mean,
what's in it for Judge Hudson...?

18:35.666 --> 18:38.345
There's got to be
a political pay-off somewhere.

18:38.346 --> 18:39.945
That's all I can say.

18:39.946 --> 18:43.306
I don't know what it is,
but there's something in it for him.

18:47.186 --> 18:49.985
No, I mean, do you have
any doubt that this was...?

18:49.986 --> 18:53.384
INAUDIBLE
You ask me, it's been scripted.

18:53.385 --> 18:56.984
It was just choreographed. It was
just completely choreographed.

18:56.985 --> 19:01.224
I've been in front of lots of judges
with lots of prosecutors

19:01.225 --> 19:04.184
in lots of situations,
and I've got to tell you,

19:04.185 --> 19:09.224
I have never, ever seen something
like that before. Never.

19:09.225 --> 19:11.544
I don't think David
and I don't think Tom, you know,

19:11.545 --> 19:14.904
believe me, or anybody from
the beginning, but when I said,

19:14.905 --> 19:19.904
this isn't Chapel Hill, this isn't
Charlotte...this is Durham.

19:19.905 --> 19:23.543
It's unique, it's particular,
it's dirty, it's corrupt,

19:23.544 --> 19:25.383
it's small, you know,

19:25.384 --> 19:27.783
I don't think anybody
knows this town better than I do,

19:27.784 --> 19:30.023
and I... It's what
I've believed for years,

19:30.024 --> 19:33.023
and I told you guys from
the beginning that this is it.

19:33.024 --> 19:37.223
I've had a personal relationship
with Orlando for years, and it never

19:37.224 --> 19:43.223
got through to me that it could
affect him personally in that way.

19:43.224 --> 19:46.824
Yeah, but...
I just find him disgusting.

19:50.184 --> 19:54.982
So...the Ratliff stuff
is coming in evidence.

19:54.983 --> 19:57.942
The gay stuff is coming in evidence.
Sure. All right?

19:57.943 --> 20:02.022
So we've got to deal with it,
no matter what.

20:02.023 --> 20:04.662
You can almost turn this
into a challenge to the DA!

20:04.663 --> 20:07.382
We don't know if it's coming or not.
Do we think it's a joke?

20:07.383 --> 20:10.182
But these are the reasons why,
if they let you get into that.

20:10.183 --> 20:12.182
If he brings it in,
we'll talk about it then,

20:12.183 --> 20:15.342
then when it doesn't come in,
you look like a hero.

20:15.343 --> 20:17.342
You look like you're real smart.

20:17.343 --> 20:19.102
For a change.

20:19.103 --> 20:20.501
THEY LAUGH

20:20.502 --> 20:22.022
Be nice!

20:25.222 --> 20:27.862
Moral support here
is very important!

20:29.502 --> 20:33.141
This is going to be
a long and arduous trial.

20:33.142 --> 20:36.701
He's only got one kidney.
I'm sick. I'm sick.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.861
I just want you to understand
that he makes these comments

20:39.862 --> 20:41.901
but you're the one
that's going to prison.

20:41.902 --> 20:43.302
THEY LAUGH

20:53.701 --> 20:57.780
If it's coming in, that's a given...
It's coming in. It's coming in.

20:57.781 --> 21:02.820
If that's the given, then I agree,
you've got to go forward with it.

21:02.821 --> 21:05.820
My presumption right now

21:05.821 --> 21:10.740
is that I'm going to take on
the Ratliff thing in some way.

21:10.741 --> 21:13.700
I'm going to, in some way,

21:13.701 --> 21:20.219
present to the jury that it's not
fair to try this stuff in the media.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.779
It's not fair.

21:21.780 --> 21:26.659
It's not our way to dig up bodies
two weeks before trial

21:26.660 --> 21:29.579
so that there's
a whole bunch of publicity.

21:29.580 --> 21:33.139
That doesn't satisfy
anybody's burden of proof.

21:33.140 --> 21:38.059
The only way you satisfy a burden of
proof is by bringing in the witness.

21:38.060 --> 21:41.979
You have that presumption of
innocence and a reasonable doubt.

21:41.980 --> 21:44.659
They've got to overcome that.

21:44.660 --> 21:48.979
The bar of reasonable doubt
has been raised significantly now

21:48.980 --> 21:50.938
in the light of the Ratliff.

21:50.939 --> 21:54.658
So it's, instead of being there,
which could play it safe,

21:54.659 --> 21:57.938
"Oh, well, they didn't prove this
or these alternative things",

21:57.939 --> 22:01.658
with this "coincidence"
it's now up to here.

22:01.659 --> 22:05.178
Anyway, all right,
I think were done.

22:05.179 --> 22:08.178
You know, this was important for you
all to be a part of. Yeah, I agree.

22:08.179 --> 22:10.338
So that you know what my
thinking is, all right?

22:10.339 --> 22:14.458
I think this is what our thinking
was all along. OK. All right.

22:14.459 --> 22:18.459
In terms of look and dress
and that tomorrow... Right.

22:19.819 --> 22:24.977
..your eyebrows need to be trimmed.
OK. You need to be shaved. Right.

22:24.978 --> 22:28.497
You need to look neat,
you need to look rested. All right?

22:28.498 --> 22:31.337
If you need to take a Valium...

22:31.338 --> 22:33.897
Sure. ..take a Valium,
because you know what?

22:33.898 --> 22:37.737
You're not going to be needing to do
anything other than sort of zone in.

22:37.738 --> 22:40.777
I know that. That's what I was...
I don't have any Valium.

22:40.778 --> 22:43.097
You don't need to fall asleep.
No, no, no.

22:43.098 --> 22:46.377
And also, the other thing is,
you know, you're going to probably

22:46.378 --> 22:48.897
hear some things that
are going to be hard to hear,

22:48.898 --> 22:52.016
and if somebody says, "Well,
we think he's absolutely guilty

22:52.017 --> 22:54.216
"and why aren't they
seeking the death penalty?"

22:54.217 --> 22:56.336
"Why don't we just
lynch him right here?" Right.

22:56.337 --> 22:58.296
Yeah, you're not going to
send them daggers,

22:58.297 --> 23:02.376
which you don't seem like the kind
of person who would do that anyway.

23:02.377 --> 23:05.496
Yeah, and you know, the truth is,
if somebody says that,

23:05.497 --> 23:10.136
the subliminal message, the body
language message, needs to be

23:10.137 --> 23:13.136
"Thank you for being that honest."

23:13.137 --> 23:16.616
The other thing is,
because of the Ratliff thing,

23:16.617 --> 23:19.376
it's very important
for Martha and Margaret...

23:19.377 --> 23:21.135
They've got to be here
the whole trial.

23:21.136 --> 23:24.095
..to be here for the whole trial.
Yeah, that worked out really nice.

23:24.096 --> 23:26.495
Because people have said
in the open-ended question,

23:26.496 --> 23:29.815
one of the reasons they
think you might not be guilty

23:29.816 --> 23:34.095
or that you have doubts, is that
he has proclaimed his innocence,

23:34.096 --> 23:36.615
his lawyer is fighting,
saying he's innocent

23:36.616 --> 23:38.496
and his family is sticking by him.

23:41.936 --> 23:45.335
Yeah, we were doing
one of these corporate exercises

23:45.336 --> 23:47.215
with the executive staff where

23:47.216 --> 23:50.254
you're supposed to tell something
personal about yourself.

23:50.255 --> 23:52.054
It's team-building, is what it is.

23:52.055 --> 23:55.174
Right. So one guy got up,
actually a very good friend of mine,

23:55.175 --> 23:58.214
since left the company, but he said,
"You know, I always wanted to...

23:58.215 --> 24:01.414
"I always wanted to be a lawyer.
That was really what I wanted to do,

24:01.415 --> 24:04.094
"but then I found Jesus
and I realised that

24:04.095 --> 24:07.854
"being a Christian and being a
lawyer are completely incompatible."

24:07.855 --> 24:09.375
THEY LAUGH

24:15.655 --> 24:17.815
It's true. True.

24:19.135 --> 24:20.293
Yeah.

24:20.294 --> 24:22.133
Oh, God.

24:22.134 --> 24:24.773
So you mean I have really
got to shut my mind off now,

24:24.774 --> 24:26.613
basically for two months.

24:26.614 --> 24:29.373
You can't read a book.
You can't bring a book up to the...

24:29.374 --> 24:31.853
HE LAUGHS

24:31.854 --> 24:34.413
Video game?

24:34.414 --> 24:37.213
I mean, you're just supposed
to sit there and look...

24:37.214 --> 24:39.213
And don't stare at the jury.

24:39.214 --> 24:40.934
Don't stare at the jury? Yeah.

24:43.254 --> 24:45.613
Because it looks like
you're soliciting them.

24:45.614 --> 24:46.773
HE SIGHS

24:46.774 --> 24:48.013
They'll be looking at you a lot.

24:48.014 --> 24:49.733
That's one thing
you have to remember,

24:49.734 --> 24:53.772
they are assessing your behaviour
and conduct. They form opinions...

24:53.773 --> 24:56.412
Dear God. ..about how you behave..
Could I get a double?

24:56.413 --> 24:58.612
LAUGHS: Just to stand there!

24:58.613 --> 25:00.693
Saddam Hussein double for me!

25:02.013 --> 25:03.293
Oh, God!

25:05.733 --> 25:07.092
Mm.

25:07.093 --> 25:09.732
I could sit in a dark, quiet room
for two months, you know,

25:09.733 --> 25:12.172
Goethe used to say
that was the test of a man.

25:12.173 --> 25:15.693
That if you could go, you could
lock a man up in a dark room...

25:17.253 --> 25:20.331
With nothing...
With nothing to read, nothing to do,

25:20.332 --> 25:23.131
nothing, just his own thoughts.

25:23.132 --> 25:26.731
That was Goethe's test of a man

25:26.732 --> 25:29.851
and I'd think,
"Well, hell, anybody can do that."

25:29.852 --> 25:33.611
I think, no, he needs to rethink
that. The real test of a man is

25:33.612 --> 25:36.931
to be able to sit there and listen
to Jim Hardin and Orlando Hudson.

25:36.932 --> 25:38.292
THEY LAUGH

25:44.572 --> 25:50.011
The range is going to
go from 39 to... 51. ..51.

25:50.012 --> 25:52.930
71, 72...

25:52.931 --> 25:54.810
61 to 72? Right.

25:54.811 --> 25:58.370
That's these. They're in order.
OK, those are in order.

25:58.371 --> 26:01.650
And then I'm going to go through
a whole long thing

26:01.651 --> 26:05.250
about the relationship and
I'm going to take them back to 1988

26:05.251 --> 26:08.890
and 1989 and 1992 and 1997,

26:08.891 --> 26:10.610
and then I'm going to say,

26:10.611 --> 26:13.810
"And together, they built a family

26:13.811 --> 26:18.770
"out of the various strands
of their prior families."

26:18.771 --> 26:21.209
Wait, wait. Hold on.

26:21.210 --> 26:24.169
I don't want to have that bar up
there, because it's going to

26:24.170 --> 26:25.929
distract them from what I'm saying.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.529
Can you just keep it black screen
until I go to your cue,

26:28.530 --> 26:30.009
and then pop up with the picture?

26:30.010 --> 26:31.569
Right, you want the picture first?

26:31.570 --> 26:34.649
I want the picture. Yeah. OK,
let's go back to the black screen.

26:34.650 --> 26:36.449
What is that thing
in the middle there?

26:36.450 --> 26:40.089
That's just a default bar
that doesn't have to show at all.

26:40.090 --> 26:41.329
I don't want it showing. OK.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.769
I can't get rid of it right now
but I... OK, yeah,

26:43.770 --> 26:46.249
let's get rid of the bar. Yeah. OK?

26:46.250 --> 26:50.089
And what I'd do like to do is, um...

26:51.809 --> 26:53.048
When I...

26:53.049 --> 26:55.009
PHONE VIBRATES

27:01.489 --> 27:04.528
It's just my telephone. Sorry.

27:04.529 --> 27:05.889
When I say...

27:07.729 --> 27:10.288
.."Together, they built a family

27:10.289 --> 27:14.088
"out of the various strands of
their prior families. Caitlin..."

27:14.089 --> 27:16.448
No, wait till I... Yeah,
but I want to get a black screen.

27:16.449 --> 27:18.168
That's right,
I want to go black screen.

27:18.169 --> 27:21.247
OK, can you turn it on
before I even get up to speak?

27:21.248 --> 27:25.008
And then go to black screen so we
don't have to see that thing again.

27:27.288 --> 27:30.487
Blacker...
Do you mean, you mean this...

27:30.488 --> 27:32.087
You want that without this?

27:32.088 --> 27:34.327
Can you lose that?
Yes, I can lose it.

27:34.328 --> 27:36.207
I can't lose it right now
but I can lose a...

27:36.208 --> 27:39.487
OK, but what I'm saying is...
Could you just go...

27:39.488 --> 27:42.087
Can you lose the whole thing
so it's just a black screen

27:42.088 --> 27:43.847
and then it goes to the picture?

27:43.848 --> 27:47.007
Yes, and it looks like that.
Yeah, that's all I want. OK.

27:47.008 --> 27:49.527
And then the next picture comes up.

27:49.528 --> 27:52.126
When I say, "Together they built
a family out of the various

27:52.127 --> 27:54.686
"strands of their prior families..."
Yeah.

27:54.687 --> 27:56.766
I'm leaving.
Do you all need anything?

27:56.767 --> 27:58.966
No, we're great,
thank you very much. Goodnight.

27:58.967 --> 28:00.326
"Out of the prior strands...

28:00.327 --> 28:03.166
"Out of the various strands of
their prior families" - put it up.

28:03.167 --> 28:06.326
OK, so they have something
to look it. Exactly. Yeah.

28:06.327 --> 28:12.566
"We can see that the laceration
on the left, the V-shaped one,

28:12.567 --> 28:15.606
"is consistent with that corner.
The last..."

28:15.607 --> 28:17.926
PHONE VIBRATES

28:17.927 --> 28:19.966
My telephone. OK.

28:19.967 --> 28:24.325
"The last impact that
you saw on that..."

28:24.326 --> 28:26.725
Um, we've got
a little situation going on.

28:26.726 --> 28:29.405
We've got smoke in the building
downstairs. OK.

28:29.406 --> 28:30.925
So we're unable to...

28:30.926 --> 28:33.325
If you can wrap it up today,

28:33.326 --> 28:35.365
how much longer do you think
you're going to be?

28:35.366 --> 28:38.045
We're going to have to
do an evacuation.

28:38.046 --> 28:41.485
We don't know yet, we haven't
found it yet. We're looking for it.

28:41.486 --> 28:44.405
OK, well, if we have to evacuate,
we're just going to have to...

28:44.406 --> 28:48.525
We'll do our best, but just let us
know. All right. Just wanted to...

28:48.526 --> 28:51.724
I appreciate it. If you see
people running... OK, thank you.

28:51.725 --> 28:56.324
"The bottoms of her feet
were covered in blood

28:56.325 --> 28:58.924
"and how do we know that?
There's a photo of it."

28:58.925 --> 29:01.684
Do you want it right now? Yes.
Do you want to prepare them for it?

29:01.685 --> 29:03.284
No, no, no.

29:03.285 --> 29:04.845
Well, that doesn't work.

29:09.925 --> 29:12.965
That doesn't work at all.
We've got this one. Whoops.

29:14.285 --> 29:15.564
No.

29:15.565 --> 29:17.685
If one is off,
they're all going to be off.

29:19.845 --> 29:23.003
And then I can put them in proper
order... This is how it needs to be.

29:23.004 --> 29:27.003
It's... I do understand that.
It's right there. I know that.

29:27.004 --> 29:29.643
I know what I did wrong
while I was doing it on the fly

29:29.644 --> 29:32.363
before we started this.
I know what I did wrong.

29:32.364 --> 29:35.403
I made an error
when I loaded them in.

29:35.404 --> 29:38.843
Right now, right now...
This system sucks

29:38.844 --> 29:41.883
because I've done it
with presentation group

29:41.884 --> 29:45.603
and I had none of these problems.

29:45.604 --> 29:46.963
None.

29:46.964 --> 29:48.484
None, none.

29:49.963 --> 29:52.362
And I am fucking pissed

29:52.363 --> 29:56.522
because it's 7:20
the night before my opening

29:56.523 --> 29:58.923
and you're fucking around with this.

30:00.643 --> 30:04.682
One of these documents is apparently
out of order. I just don't know...

30:04.683 --> 30:08.882
I cannot give you the documents
in the order that you want them.

30:08.883 --> 30:12.682
All I can do right now is go
through. I guarantee you...

30:12.683 --> 30:15.082
No, I don't want a guarantee.
..they will be there.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.482
I want to see it on the screen,

30:17.483 --> 30:21.001
so I don't give a shit
if we're here all fucking night.

30:21.002 --> 30:25.442
Well, I'm not sure that they will be
either. I think so but I don't know.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.522
HE SIGHS

30:42.922 --> 30:48.201
This case is no more
and no longer about Kathleen.

30:48.202 --> 30:51.280
The DA has to win. That's it.

30:51.281 --> 30:54.640
He doesn't care how,
and basically, by the same token,

30:54.641 --> 30:57.240
my lawyer, they want to win.

30:57.241 --> 31:00.200
Truth is lost in all of this now.

31:00.201 --> 31:03.000
Truth is of no meaning whatsoever.

31:03.001 --> 31:07.040
This has become a show
and it has got its own momentum

31:07.041 --> 31:09.120
and we're just going along.

31:09.121 --> 31:12.800
I don't think the DA cares
about the truth any more.

31:12.801 --> 31:17.680
All he wants to do is win,
and I understand that. I mean, sure.

31:17.681 --> 31:22.319
In the same way with David,
he wants to win.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.879
Well, I want to win too,
but I'm still very concerned about

31:25.880 --> 31:29.840
the reality of
what happened that night.

31:51.679 --> 31:53.079
Hey, guys.

32:01.399 --> 32:03.158
Where's Mike?

32:03.159 --> 32:05.638
What's that? They just hit
a stop light. OK, I'll wait.

32:05.639 --> 32:06.919
I'll wait, I'll wait.

32:14.399 --> 32:16.759
Be nice. Be calm.

32:19.719 --> 32:21.277
You all right? Yeah, yeah.

32:21.278 --> 32:22.918
Pretty good. How you doing? Yeah.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.557
It's OK. You want me to get that,
Dad? What's that?

32:41.558 --> 32:42.878
You want me to get that?

32:44.718 --> 32:46.638
INDISTINCT

32:58.077 --> 33:01.556
All right, Chris, we're going to
see if you can beat us upstairs now.

33:01.557 --> 33:03.197
We got a crew on that. Ah...

33:11.317 --> 33:12.557
Hey.

33:13.877 --> 33:15.636
Thanks. OK, all right.

33:15.637 --> 33:17.476
All right, that's fine, that's fine.

33:17.477 --> 33:19.036
All right, Hart.

33:19.037 --> 33:22.075
See you up there, buddy.
Run up now.

33:22.076 --> 33:24.636
Want to see you as
I get out of the elevator.

33:26.236 --> 33:28.075
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

33:28.076 --> 33:31.995
Start with the 911 and then...
After the... After the...

33:31.996 --> 33:35.195
..last headshot, then
get the movie ready. Right.

33:35.196 --> 33:37.516
After the third laceration shot.
Right.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.475
Yo, buddy.

33:46.476 --> 33:49.596
THEY TALK QUIETLY

33:59.915 --> 34:01.915
SHUTTERS CLICK

34:21.353 --> 34:23.234
Good morning to each of you.

34:24.914 --> 34:27.553
The core issues are simple

34:27.554 --> 34:30.434
but everything else
about this case isn't.

34:31.434 --> 34:36.313
In a very real sense, this case
is about pretence and appearances.

34:37.954 --> 34:42.553
The defendant says that Kathleen
Peterson's death was caused by

34:42.554 --> 34:47.033
a tragic accidental fall
downstairs in their home

34:47.034 --> 34:52.192
and we say, on the other hand, that
she died a horrible, painful death

34:52.193 --> 34:54.911
at the hands of her husband,
Michael Peterson.

34:54.913 --> 34:59.432
I've selected a couple of pictures
for you that really in my mind

34:59.433 --> 35:02.472
show this diametric opposition.

35:02.473 --> 35:06.472
The first photograph I'm going to
show you is of Kathleen.

35:06.473 --> 35:11.432
This would have been taken,
this is how she would have looked

35:11.433 --> 35:14.352
prior to December 9th of 2001,

35:14.353 --> 35:18.432
had you seen her in her home
or possibly at work.

35:18.433 --> 35:23.351
You can see from this photograph,
you can feel from this photograph,

35:23.352 --> 35:28.351
that she's a very
genteel, warm person.

35:28.352 --> 35:33.031
Now, on December 9th of 2001,

35:33.032 --> 35:34.631
at 2:48,

35:34.632 --> 35:38.391
when EMS personnel first arrive,

35:38.392 --> 35:42.192
they see Kathleen Peterson
in a completely different way.

35:43.592 --> 35:46.872
They see her lying at
the bottom of her steps...

35:49.512 --> 35:51.631
..just as you see
in this photograph.

35:54.031 --> 35:59.950
Now, later that day, after her body
has been removed from the home,

35:59.951 --> 36:02.950
she's taken to
the medical examiner's office.

36:02.951 --> 36:06.910
This is one of
the first photographs taken of her

36:06.911 --> 36:12.950
as she's lying on a steel gurney
in the medical examiner's office

36:12.951 --> 36:15.430
after they've shaved her head

36:15.431 --> 36:18.751
so that they can determine
where the wounds are.

36:21.790 --> 36:25.429
This is where the rubber meets
the road, ladies and gentlemen.

36:25.430 --> 36:27.509
They say it's an accident

36:27.510 --> 36:31.949
that was caused by
a couple of falls in that stairway

36:31.950 --> 36:33.909
and we say it's not.

36:33.910 --> 36:35.390
We say it's murder.

36:41.550 --> 36:44.189
You heard Mr Rudolf talk with you

36:44.190 --> 36:47.709
about the fact that
we didn't have a weapon.

36:47.710 --> 36:49.549
That's true.

36:49.550 --> 36:52.268
We don't have the actual implement

36:52.269 --> 36:55.869
that Mike Peterson used
to cause this injury.

36:58.029 --> 37:02.669
Wounding, lacerations to
the back of Kathleen's head.

37:03.709 --> 37:05.988
But we have an identical replica.

37:05.989 --> 37:08.148
Where did we get it?

37:08.149 --> 37:11.908
Kathleen's sister Candace
gave several family members

37:11.909 --> 37:14.348
a blow poker just like this one.

37:14.349 --> 37:16.268
Kathleen had had this in her home

37:16.269 --> 37:18.468
for years and years
and years and years,

37:18.469 --> 37:22.628
but mysteriously,
on December 9th, it's gone.

37:24.148 --> 37:27.187
It's hollow, it's light,

37:27.188 --> 37:32.867
it's easily used and we will contend
to you this, or something like this,

37:32.868 --> 37:36.828
is the article that was
used to inflict these wounds.

37:40.548 --> 37:43.627
The blow poker that had
been given to Kathleen

37:43.628 --> 37:48.227
15 years before, apparently,
and is now mysteriously missing -

37:48.228 --> 37:51.147
we'll hear about whether
it's mysterious or not.

37:52.307 --> 37:55.546
They didn't find any murder weapon.

37:55.547 --> 37:56.986
Nothing was found.

37:56.987 --> 38:00.506
Where did it go?
Where did this blow poker go?

38:00.507 --> 38:03.506
They searched his cars.
There wasn't any blood in the cars.

38:03.507 --> 38:06.826
They went all around the house,
there wasn't any blood upstairs,

38:06.827 --> 38:09.706
he didn't change his clothes,
he didn't...

38:09.707 --> 38:12.146
Where did he get rid of it?

38:12.147 --> 38:13.347
And when?

38:14.867 --> 38:16.666
That's left mysterious,

38:16.667 --> 38:20.385
but we don't convict people
based on mysterious here.

38:20.386 --> 38:25.906
I mean, can you imagine somebody
beating somebody over the head...

38:27.426 --> 38:29.225
..whacking them as hard as
they can?

38:29.226 --> 38:30.705
Because you don't whack
someone,

38:30.706 --> 38:34.185
you don't whack somebody like this
when you're trying to kill them.

38:34.186 --> 38:38.385
Imagine that
there's no skull fracture,

38:38.386 --> 38:41.065
there's no brain contusions,

38:41.066 --> 38:43.425
there's no swelling of the brain,

38:43.426 --> 38:46.465
there's none of the internal
haemorrhages, subdurals,

38:46.466 --> 38:50.424
things like that, that you would see
from that kind of injury.

38:50.425 --> 38:52.545
No. None of them.

38:53.545 --> 38:58.824
We intend to show you during this
trial, to the best of our ability,

38:58.825 --> 39:05.384
what happened in that stairway on
December 9th was a tragic accident,

39:05.385 --> 39:08.185
an accident that
left Michael Peterson...

39:10.265 --> 39:12.824
..not a wealthy man
but a very poor man,

39:12.825 --> 39:17.064
in the thing that was
most important to him.

39:17.065 --> 39:21.384
It left him without his soul mate.

39:24.504 --> 39:27.543
Kathleen and Michael connected
in a way that...

39:27.544 --> 39:33.463
that a few people who are
really, really lucky in life

39:33.464 --> 39:36.223
have a chance to connect.

39:36.224 --> 39:39.704
And they built a family,
the two of them...

39:41.264 --> 39:46.264
..built a family out of the strands
of their prior families.

39:48.904 --> 39:51.422
Todd on the left,

39:51.423 --> 39:55.782
Kathleen and Michael, Margaret sort
of peeking out from the back there,

39:55.783 --> 39:59.463
Caitlin in the front,
Clayton and Martha.

40:00.823 --> 40:04.582
What kept them together,
what caused them to build that,

40:04.583 --> 40:10.463
was a love that absolutely everyone
who saw them or knew them...

40:12.743 --> 40:16.663
..understood and
recognised and envied.

40:17.903 --> 40:21.381
Listen to how Caitlin Atwater,

40:21.382 --> 40:24.981
who unfortunately now sits
on opposite sides -

40:24.982 --> 40:27.621
and that's one of
the real tragedies of this case -

40:27.622 --> 40:29.581
listen to how she described

40:29.582 --> 40:32.461
what Michael Peterson meant
to her mother.

40:32.462 --> 40:38.981
This is from 1999. "Michael Peterson
stopped my mother's tears.

40:38.982 --> 40:42.861
"I used to sit at the top of the
stairs leaning through the banister

40:42.862 --> 40:46.341
"and listen to my mother sob
every night

40:46.342 --> 40:49.860
"for a year after my father left.

40:49.861 --> 40:52.740
"My father had torn her apart,

40:52.741 --> 40:56.860
"crushing her shell and
the illusion in which she lived,

40:56.861 --> 41:00.260
"destroying her dignity and pride,

41:00.261 --> 41:05.700
"but Mike was able to
restore her strength and confidence

41:05.701 --> 41:09.541
"and to show her that
she could find true love.

41:10.941 --> 41:17.860
"From the beginning, I was in debt
to Mike in my heart and mind

41:17.861 --> 41:21.340
"for bringing back
my mother's happiness."

41:24.020 --> 41:27.379
You know,
if the prosecution is correct,

41:27.380 --> 41:32.859
how do we go from
soul mate and lover

41:32.860 --> 41:35.419
to cold-blooded murderer?

41:35.420 --> 41:37.139
How does that happen?

41:37.140 --> 41:40.099
Well, the answer is very simple.
You don't.

41:40.100 --> 41:43.259
The truth is that Kathleen Peterson,

41:43.260 --> 41:46.059
after drinking some wine
and some champagne

41:46.060 --> 41:48.019
and taking some Valium,

41:48.020 --> 41:53.138
tried to walk up a narrow,
poorly lit stairway in flip-flops

41:53.139 --> 41:55.939
and she fell and she bled to death.

41:58.859 --> 42:02.658
What Michael Peterson brought
to Kathleen Peterson

42:02.659 --> 42:05.819
was true happiness over 13 years.

42:10.219 --> 42:13.538
That's the picture.

42:13.539 --> 42:14.939
That's not posed.

42:16.739 --> 42:19.579
That's Kathleen sitting
on Michael's lap.

42:20.738 --> 42:27.257
Now, what you see there is
the happiness that she felt with him

42:27.258 --> 42:30.498
and that he felt with her.

42:33.218 --> 42:36.777
Everyone who really knew
that relationship,

42:36.778 --> 42:42.378
everyone who knew them,
knew that they loved each other.

42:43.698 --> 42:47.577
Everyone who knew them

42:47.578 --> 42:52.536
knows that Michael Peterson
had nothing to do with

42:52.537 --> 42:55.217
the death of Kathleen Peterson.

42:57.177 --> 42:59.337
And at the end of
all the evidence...

43:00.417 --> 43:04.656
..I'm going to ask the 12 of you
to come back and return a verdict

43:04.657 --> 43:09.096
that will in fact speak the truth in
this case -

43:09.097 --> 43:11.456
a verdict of not guilty.

43:11.457 --> 43:12.777
Thank you.

43:14.457 --> 43:15.976
All right, members of the jury,

43:15.977 --> 43:18.936
we're going to take
our lunch break at this point.

43:18.937 --> 43:22.136
Mr Deputy, 1:30. All stand.

43:23.576 --> 43:24.935
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.935
The Court of the County of Durham is
in recess until 1:30 this afternoon.

43:27.936 --> 43:30.096
God save the state
and this honourable court.
