WEBVTT

00:06.043 --> 00:07.826
[sighs]
Oh, my God.

00:07.869 --> 00:09.826
It's like a war zone
in here.

00:09.869 --> 00:11.043
I love it.

00:11.086 --> 00:12.608
You can't be
serious, Martin.

00:12.652 --> 00:14.086
Sweetie, it's got tons
of potential.

00:14.130 --> 00:15.478
And we just started
the remodel.

00:15.521 --> 00:18.347
I mean, isn't
this view fabulous?

00:18.391 --> 00:21.391
Yeah, if you're into
bomb shelter chic.

00:21.434 --> 00:22.869
And the window
is missing.

00:24.173 --> 00:25.739
Oh, we'll replace that--
not a problem.

00:25.782 --> 00:27.130
I'm telling you,

00:27.173 --> 00:29.391
this area will blow up
in a few years.

00:29.434 --> 00:30.565
Trust me.

00:30.608 --> 00:32.608
Pretty sure it
already has.

00:32.652 --> 00:34.521
Jane, come on.
Be positive.

00:34.565 --> 00:37.043
Think about this
as one of your projects.

00:37.086 --> 00:38.521
And I know
how much you love

00:38.565 --> 00:40.086
to get into
your projects.

00:40.130 --> 00:43.391
Well, these original-pane
windows are fabulous.

00:43.434 --> 00:44.565
Mm-hmm.

00:44.608 --> 00:46.739
So how about we
see the rest?

00:46.782 --> 00:49.130
Now, you'll have your
choice of flooring.

00:49.173 --> 00:51.652
Polished concrete
is what's hot now,

00:51.695 --> 00:53.608
but if you want
to choose something else,

00:53.652 --> 00:55.652
we can certainly
arrange that.

00:55.695 --> 00:56.521
[screams]
[gasps]
Oh, my God!

00:56.565 --> 00:57.913
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

00:57.956 --> 00:59.695
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:33.565 --> 01:35.000
Come on. It's no big deal.

01:35.043 --> 01:37.391
We're family, right?

01:37.434 --> 01:39.043
Just tell me.

01:39.086 --> 01:41.043
McGEE:
You go, then me.

01:41.086 --> 01:42.173
No, no, no, Timmy.

01:42.217 --> 01:43.652
That's not how
this game works.

01:43.695 --> 01:45.521
I asked you first.

01:45.565 --> 01:48.260
Which means now
you gotta... go.

01:48.304 --> 01:50.913
Fine. Maxine.

01:50.956 --> 01:52.565
The gamer girl.
She was pretty.

01:52.608 --> 01:54.130
That was like a year ago.

01:54.173 --> 01:55.304
It was ten months ago.

01:55.347 --> 01:56.608
And don't change the subject.

01:56.652 --> 01:57.782
Your turn.

01:57.826 --> 02:00.000
That's some dry
spell, McMonk.

02:00.043 --> 02:01.608
That's not healthy.

02:01.652 --> 02:02.782
Here.

02:02.826 --> 02:04.217
[grunts]

02:05.478 --> 02:06.826
There we go.

02:06.869 --> 02:08.391
[sighs]

02:08.434 --> 02:10.130
A man needs human affection.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.782
I see what's
going on here.

02:11.826 --> 02:13.565
You're trying to turn the tables
because you

02:13.608 --> 02:14.869
are the one
that's not getting any.

02:14.913 --> 02:16.434
[laughing]:
What? Don't be ridiculous.

02:16.478 --> 02:17.869
Who told you that?

02:17.913 --> 02:19.260
Told him what?
Aah!

02:19.304 --> 02:20.652
Morning. Ziva.

02:20.695 --> 02:22.434
Hi. Hey, McGee,
I need a favor.

02:22.478 --> 02:24.000
I would like you
to block a number.

02:24.043 --> 02:25.652
It is a secure government line.

02:25.695 --> 02:27.217
Wouldn't belong
to "C.I.-Ray," would it?

02:27.260 --> 02:28.869
It does not matter,
and this does not concern you.

02:28.913 --> 02:30.304
I'll take that as a yes.

02:30.347 --> 02:33.043
Back a few days,
and already avoiding his calls.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.521
Ouch.
It is complicated,

02:34.565 --> 02:36.260
and I would rather
not discuss it,

02:36.304 --> 02:38.521
so why don't you
just zipper it up, Tony?

02:38.565 --> 02:40.521
My zipper's fine.

02:40.565 --> 02:41.608
Not a word, you.

02:41.652 --> 02:43.434
But I take your point.

02:43.478 --> 02:46.173
Good. Because that is all
I'm going to say on the subject.

02:46.217 --> 02:48.043
So please do not
ask me again.

02:48.086 --> 02:53.956
[cell phone ringing]

02:54.000 --> 02:56.043
I will forward you the number.

02:56.086 --> 02:58.565
[phone ringing]

03:02.000 --> 03:04.347
Agent DiNozzo.

03:04.391 --> 03:06.826
Yes. No.

03:06.869 --> 03:09.608
Are you free
for a couples massage later?

03:09.652 --> 03:12.043
Ray is asking.

03:12.086 --> 03:14.434
Later.[Ziva chuckles]

03:14.478 --> 03:16.130
That's very funny.
He would never call you.

03:16.173 --> 03:17.478
Actually, he just did.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.826
[phone ringing]

03:20.869 --> 03:22.217
Uh, I've got a private number

03:22.260 --> 03:23.956
coming through here.
Think it may be Ray?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.260
Ignore. Hit ignore.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.130
You better hope
he doesn't call Gibbs.

03:30.173 --> 03:31.565
Too late.

03:31.608 --> 03:32.478
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

03:32.521 --> 03:33.869
I'm-I'm going to fix this.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.565
Not right now,
you won't.

03:35.608 --> 03:37.565
We got bigger things
to deal with.

03:37.608 --> 03:40.130
Got a dead Naval officer
downtown; let's go.

03:52.173 --> 03:54.260
No shell casings,
boss, but I did find

03:54.304 --> 03:56.695
several bullet
holes in the walls.

03:56.739 --> 03:58.304
Rounds?
Looks like they
were extracted.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.086
Maybe using some
kind of a blade.

04:00.130 --> 04:01.521
Counted at
least nine.

04:01.565 --> 04:03.608
GIBBS:
She never had a chance.

04:03.652 --> 04:05.130
Police are thinking
robbery gone wrong.

04:05.173 --> 04:06.478
Found a wallet dumped nearby.

04:06.521 --> 04:08.521
Had nothing in it
but a couple of bucks.

04:08.565 --> 04:10.217
Gibbs, neither the clients
nor the Realtor

04:10.260 --> 04:12.130
saw anyone going in or out
of the building.

04:12.173 --> 04:13.478
Also, the Realtor
has not had

04:13.521 --> 04:15.217
any workers in the loft
since last week,

04:15.260 --> 04:16.956
but a few do
possess keys.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.608
I.D.

04:18.652 --> 04:20.739
Lieutenant Commander
Maya Burris.

04:20.782 --> 04:22.434
35, married,
no children.

04:22.478 --> 04:25.173
Served as a Naval
attaché overseas.

04:25.217 --> 04:26.478
Then how'd she end up dead here?

04:26.521 --> 04:28.043
DUCKY:
Ah, that would be

04:28.086 --> 04:30.739
the million dollar question,
Agent DiNozzo.

04:30.782 --> 04:32.608
Multiple gunshots, Duck.

04:32.652 --> 04:35.086
Yeah, so it would appear.

04:35.130 --> 04:37.086
One in the abdomen,
one in the chest

04:37.130 --> 04:38.565
and one in the neck.

04:40.565 --> 04:42.304
Huh.

04:42.347 --> 04:44.913
Blood loss
is definitely minimal

04:44.956 --> 04:46.608
for such a wound.

04:46.652 --> 04:48.695
Oh...!TONY: Why is Jimmy Palmer
talking to a girl

04:48.739 --> 04:50.000
from 1965?

04:50.043 --> 04:51.347
DUCKY: He's just not
doing his job,

04:51.391 --> 04:53.000
unfortunately.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.739
Mr. Palmer!

04:54.782 --> 04:57.565
Oh, yes.
Apologies, Doctor.

04:57.608 --> 04:59.391
Sandy and I went
to high school together.

04:59.434 --> 05:01.043
Haven't seen her
in ages.

05:01.086 --> 05:03.565
Super sweet,
kind of high-strung.

05:03.608 --> 05:05.391
Uh... [laughs]

05:05.434 --> 05:07.652
She was pretty shocked
to see me here.

05:07.695 --> 05:09.043
Uh, what is
the big deal?

05:09.086 --> 05:11.260
So I work on dead people.
[chuckles]

05:11.304 --> 05:12.565
Or worked.

05:12.608 --> 05:14.217
What?

05:14.260 --> 05:15.391
Oh. Yeah.

05:15.434 --> 05:17.043
Judging by the rigor,

05:17.086 --> 05:19.434
the time of death,
I'd estimate, was about six

05:19.478 --> 05:20.652
or seven hours ago.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.478
Possible defensive
wounds here, Doctor?

05:22.521 --> 05:24.478
Maybe she struggled
with her attacker.

05:24.521 --> 05:25.565
MAN: Where is she?
Get outta my way!

05:25.608 --> 05:27.260
MAN 2: Nick, Nick, Nick!
Come on, Nick!

05:27.304 --> 05:28.608
Come on, man. Come on!Move!

05:28.652 --> 05:30.260
TONY: Hey! Hey!ZIVA: Hey! Stop!

05:30.304 --> 05:32.391
Let him go.
Let him go.
ZIVA: Easy.

05:32.434 --> 05:33.391
GIBBS: It's our crime
scene, Detective.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.434
Come here, Nick.

05:34.478 --> 05:35.652
Nick.

05:35.695 --> 05:36.826
Maya!

05:36.869 --> 05:38.608
He's Detective Nick
Burris, her husband.

05:38.652 --> 05:39.565
Maya!Nick!

05:39.608 --> 05:41.565
Nick, come on, man.
Come on.

05:41.608 --> 05:43.869
Let's go.

05:49.043 --> 05:51.304
Keep your partner away
from this investigation.

05:51.347 --> 05:52.869
Can't make any guarantees.

05:52.913 --> 05:54.869
Nick's a bulldog--
always has been.

05:54.913 --> 05:56.173
He that way with his wife?

05:56.217 --> 05:58.521
Come on. I meant
with his job, okay?

05:58.565 --> 06:00.913
He's the best damn
homicide detective we got.

06:00.956 --> 06:02.000
How long you been partners?

06:02.043 --> 06:03.826
Almost 13 years.

06:03.869 --> 06:05.434
Wow.

06:05.478 --> 06:06.869
Can't break a case
without him, huh?

06:06.913 --> 06:08.826
[chuckling]: Yeah.
Well, pretty much.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.521
Maya used to say that I
was his, uh, second wife.

06:12.565 --> 06:13.956
Problems.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.521
No.

06:15.565 --> 06:17.521
Never.
He's the only cop I know

06:17.565 --> 06:19.086
who's still
on his first marriage.

06:19.130 --> 06:21.043
TONY: How about you,
Detective?

06:21.086 --> 06:22.608
Second? Third?

06:26.652 --> 06:27.956
Yeah.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.652
I'm, uh...
not very proud of it.

06:30.695 --> 06:32.434
Sometimes I wish
I was more like Nick.

06:32.478 --> 06:34.217
You know,
a one-woman kind of guy.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.478
Listen, I got
to get back.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.043
You guys need anything else,
just let me know.

06:38.086 --> 06:40.043
Will do.
Thanks for stopping by.

06:40.086 --> 06:42.739
Can't believe his name's
Detective Flowers.

06:42.782 --> 06:44.652
Ziva, McGee, background.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.347
Lieutenant Commander
Maya Burris.

06:46.391 --> 06:47.782
12 years active duty.

06:47.826 --> 06:49.913
Worked as a Naval attaché
in various posts

06:49.956 --> 06:51.521
around the world the
past three years.

06:51.565 --> 06:52.913
Returned home to DC
five days ago

06:52.956 --> 06:54.304
to visit her husband.

06:54.347 --> 06:55.521
The commander is skilled

06:55.565 --> 06:56.913
at dealing with
high-level diplomats.

06:56.956 --> 06:58.956
Colleagues describe her
as bright and ambitious.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.086
McGEE: Also said she
spoke her mind,

07:01.130 --> 07:02.869
even if that meant
ruffling a few feathers.

07:02.913 --> 07:04.130
Last assignment?

07:04.173 --> 07:06.478
Helped organize
a diplomatic mission in Egypt.

07:06.521 --> 07:08.000
Reported to the
defense attaché

07:08.043 --> 07:10.478
and U.S. ambassador
at our embassy there.

07:10.521 --> 07:11.782
McGEE: But that mission
ended last month.

07:11.826 --> 07:13.304
What's she
been doing since?

07:13.347 --> 07:15.304
ZIVA:
A colleague on that mission
said that she believed

07:15.347 --> 07:16.913
the commander was already
on another assignment.

07:16.956 --> 07:17.913
I contacted the embassy
in Cairo

07:17.956 --> 07:19.130
to confirm,
but no word back.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.478
Keep trying.

07:20.521 --> 07:21.913
Listen, let's go back
downstairs, all right?

07:21.956 --> 07:23.782
I'm fine. Relax.
Hey. Hey.
Let them...

07:23.826 --> 07:25.521
You... no, you, I just...Come on, let's go
back downstairs.

07:25.565 --> 07:27.695
I just want to talk.
I want to talk to you.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.000
Detective, you're not
supposed to be here.

07:29.043 --> 07:31.391
What's going on?
I want... I want answers now.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.826
[Nick panting]

07:33.869 --> 07:36.043
Go home. Sober up.

07:36.086 --> 07:37.913
I'm not going anywhere.

07:41.130 --> 07:43.521
DiNozzo, conference room.

07:46.434 --> 07:48.000
Here we go.
Come on.

07:49.043 --> 07:50.043
Nice work, Flowers.

07:50.086 --> 07:51.782
Like I said, bulldog.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.000
What's that?

08:01.043 --> 08:02.565
It's coffee.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.739
GIBBS:
Drink it.

08:03.782 --> 08:05.130
What, do I look
like I want coffee?

08:05.173 --> 08:06.826
I want to know
who killed my wife.

08:06.869 --> 08:08.043
We're moving as fast
as we can, Detective.

08:08.086 --> 08:09.043
Well, move faster.

08:09.086 --> 08:10.956
Find the bastard.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.869
Look, we know this is hard,
but you showing up here hammered

08:13.913 --> 08:15.565
doesn't exactly
help the whole process.

08:15.608 --> 08:17.869
My wife was just shot to death.

08:17.913 --> 08:19.434
All right?

08:19.478 --> 08:21.565
I think I'm entitled
to a few drinks.

08:21.608 --> 08:22.826
When'd you last talk?

08:22.869 --> 08:25.043
Uh...

08:25.086 --> 08:27.086
yesterday after... noon.

08:27.130 --> 08:29.000
We were...

08:29.043 --> 08:31.913
I didn't...
I didn't hear from her again.

08:31.956 --> 08:36.217
We were supposed to, uh,
have dinner at our usual place.

08:36.260 --> 08:39.956
And... she just
got back this week.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.260
Back from where?Middle East.

08:42.304 --> 08:44.695
Or, uh, maybe Africa.

08:44.739 --> 08:47.173
It's... I don't...
it's hard to keep up sometimes.

08:47.217 --> 08:49.826
Her job... took her everywhere.

08:50.869 --> 08:52.130
Must have been hard

08:52.173 --> 08:53.869
watching her go
to those dangerous places.

08:53.913 --> 08:56.043
Yeah, I never worried.

08:56.086 --> 08:58.434
You know, if...

08:58.478 --> 09:01.043
if there was anybody
who could handle herself,

09:01.086 --> 09:03.565
it was, uh... it was Maya.

09:03.608 --> 09:04.869
She have any
trouble at work?

09:04.913 --> 09:08.304
No. Not that I know of.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.434
You know, she was,
uh, committed to the Navy,

09:11.478 --> 09:12.956
proud of her job as an attaché.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.478
It was one of the things
I, uh, loved about her.

09:17.652 --> 09:18.956
I just, uh...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.652
I can't...

09:21.695 --> 09:23.913
[sighs]

09:23.956 --> 09:25.043
I can't, uh, believe this.

09:25.086 --> 09:27.086
I mean, why? Why?

09:29.000 --> 09:30.956
She was a
good person.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.347
Such a good...

09:34.956 --> 09:36.043
[sniffs]

09:36.086 --> 09:39.260
Whoever, uh, did this
has to pay.

09:39.304 --> 09:42.434
Let us do our job, Detective.

09:42.478 --> 09:44.478
If you don't, I will.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.913
Wow.

09:50.956 --> 09:53.347
Such a tragedy.

09:53.391 --> 09:55.956
Every premature death
is tragic, Mr. Palmer.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.956
Oh, no, no, I wasn't talking
about the commander.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.695
Oh, it... what happened
was awful, yes,

10:00.739 --> 10:03.304
but, uh... she's gone.

10:03.347 --> 10:05.956
She can't
feel pain anymore.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Her husband,
on the other hand...

10:08.043 --> 10:12.043
Seeing him reminded you
of your upcoming vows.

10:12.086 --> 10:14.130
"Till death do us part."

10:14.173 --> 10:15.869
[chuckling]

10:15.913 --> 10:17.652
Ah, those words.

10:17.695 --> 10:19.000
It... it's so serious.

10:19.043 --> 10:21.173
Why-why can't it be
something more fun

10:21.217 --> 10:23.391
like, uh...
"Till we meet again"

10:23.434 --> 10:25.478
or, "Till the next sunrise"?

10:25.521 --> 10:27.260
Or, uh...

10:27.304 --> 10:29.173
"Till you lose all
your hair, gain 300 pounds

10:29.217 --> 10:31.043
and I can't stand
to look at you anymore."

10:31.086 --> 10:32.347
[both laughing]

10:32.391 --> 10:33.782
Oh, you know
I'm kidding.

10:33.826 --> 10:35.347
Love is blind.

10:35.391 --> 10:36.782
This is the
most wonderful

10:36.826 --> 10:38.652
time of your life.

10:38.695 --> 10:40.086
Enjoy it.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.913
Hopefully, you'll only
have to do it once.

10:44.956 --> 10:46.782
Give me the latest, Duck.Commander Burris.

10:46.826 --> 10:49.478
Uh, manner of death:
multiple gunshot wounds.

10:49.521 --> 10:50.869
Three in total.

10:50.913 --> 10:52.565
The fatal shot was
through the heart, here.

10:52.608 --> 10:55.000
Bullet lodged
against her spinal cord.

10:55.043 --> 10:56.782
Abby is running tests.

10:56.826 --> 10:58.521
We didn't pull any prints.

10:58.565 --> 11:01.652
Yes, nor any stray
hair or fiber.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.608
The killer went to great pains
to clean her up.

11:04.652 --> 11:07.130
Abby found minute traces
of bleach on her clothing.

11:07.173 --> 11:10.043
Which would account for
the lack of blood
at the crime scene.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.304
Doesn't track with a robbery.

11:11.347 --> 11:12.434
Nor does this.

11:12.478 --> 11:13.652
Show him.

11:13.695 --> 11:16.347
Yeah, we found abrasions
here on the wrist,

11:16.391 --> 11:17.826
consistent with someone
trying to yank off

11:17.869 --> 11:19.826
a bracelet or a watch.

11:19.869 --> 11:21.217
Similar abrasion here,

11:21.260 --> 11:22.608
where the wedding
ring should've been.

11:22.652 --> 11:26.608
But these abrasions
are both dry and clean.

11:26.652 --> 11:29.434
In other words, post-mortem.

11:29.478 --> 11:33.260
Yes, I would estimate about
at least an hour afterwards.

11:33.304 --> 11:35.652
Body was tampered with; someone
was trying to throw us off.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.391
This is a killer with a
knowledge of police procedure.

11:38.434 --> 11:41.478
Someone with the skills
to cover up a murder.

11:41.521 --> 11:43.000
14 days.

11:43.043 --> 11:44.478
Two weeks.

11:44.521 --> 11:46.043
That's all it's been,
McGee, two weeks.

11:46.086 --> 11:48.565
I'm very happy for you,
Tony, but I don't care.

11:49.869 --> 11:51.478
[sighs]

11:51.521 --> 11:53.086
God help me, what?

11:53.130 --> 11:56.913
Last night, I was
crashed out on my couch,

11:56.956 --> 12:01.130
and I'm thinking there's got
to be more to it than this.

12:01.173 --> 12:04.217
An endless stream of
waitresses and veterinarians.

12:05.260 --> 12:06.347
Don't ask.

12:06.391 --> 12:07.782
You looking for love, Tony?

12:07.826 --> 12:09.956
In all the wrong faces.
I mean...

12:10.000 --> 12:11.434
look at Gibbs, right?

12:11.478 --> 12:14.043
Been married four times,
still trying to figure it out.

12:14.086 --> 12:15.782
Spends a lot of time
in his basement.

12:15.826 --> 12:17.000
What about Ziva?

12:17.043 --> 12:19.043
She's like a bad
Israeli romance novel.

12:19.086 --> 12:22.565
She's not exactly the picture
of emotional stability.

12:22.608 --> 12:24.000
That is rich, coming from you.

12:26.130 --> 12:28.869
You saying I'm
emotionally unstable, Ziva?

12:28.913 --> 12:30.217
More like
emotionally challenged.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.130
Nobody asked you.GIBBS:
I'm asking.

12:32.173 --> 12:33.043
Give me something.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.869
[clears throat]

12:34.913 --> 12:36.956
Like most Navy personnel,
Commander Burris held

12:37.000 --> 12:38.173
a $400,000

12:38.217 --> 12:39.956
life insurance policy,
the sole beneficiary

12:40.000 --> 12:42.478
of which was none other
than her husband.

12:42.521 --> 12:45.565
And Detective Burris will start
receiving payments right away.

12:45.608 --> 12:47.956
But he was spending
the cash long ago.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.043
Specifically on this
28-foot beauty,

12:50.086 --> 12:51.913
cost over a
hundred grand.

12:51.956 --> 12:53.956
It's hard to swing
that on a cop's salary.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.521
McGee, phone
records, e-mails.

12:55.565 --> 12:58.000
Uh, so far, nothing unusual
in her Navy correspondence,

12:58.043 --> 13:00.782
and no personal e-mail
account to speak of.

13:00.826 --> 13:02.608
Cell phone activity
has been sporadic,

13:02.652 --> 13:04.173
but the majority
of the calls made

13:04.217 --> 13:06.000
were in the last week
to her husband.

13:06.043 --> 13:07.043
When?

13:07.086 --> 13:08.826
Uh, most recent
was last night,

13:08.869 --> 13:10.304
three hours before her death.

13:10.347 --> 13:12.521
ZIVA: In addition to the
commander's travels to Egypt,

13:12.565 --> 13:14.956
there were numerous
flights to Islamabad

13:15.000 --> 13:16.652
from Cairo this past month.

13:16.695 --> 13:17.782
This personal or business?

13:17.826 --> 13:19.130
We do not yet know.

13:19.173 --> 13:20.391
They could have
been tracking someone

13:20.434 --> 13:21.652
as part of her new assignment.

13:21.695 --> 13:23.565
Find out.

13:28.782 --> 13:30.000
Busy day, Abbs.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.217
Yep. Hey, Gibbs.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.000
I mean, it was fun.

13:33.043 --> 13:34.304
Or, well,

13:34.347 --> 13:36.434
as fun as re-creating
a murder scene can be.

13:36.478 --> 13:38.304
Which, I guess, is, um,

13:38.347 --> 13:39.956
not at all.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.347
Um, I measured the trajectory

13:42.391 --> 13:45.130
of the nine bullets that
were fired into the loft.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.652
In particular, the three
that hit Commander Burris.

13:47.695 --> 13:48.956
This would be her.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.652
Yeah, I got that.So,

13:50.695 --> 13:52.956
based on initial reports
from the crime scene,

13:53.000 --> 13:55.521
our killer stood... here,

13:55.565 --> 13:57.000
15 feet away,

13:57.043 --> 14:00.043
but according to my
calculations, that is way off.

14:00.086 --> 14:02.695
The shots that went
into the body,

14:02.739 --> 14:05.913
don't match up
with any of these.

14:07.217 --> 14:09.565
But watch what happens

14:09.608 --> 14:12.608
when I do this.

14:13.826 --> 14:15.000
[beep]

14:22.521 --> 14:24.565
GIBBS:
Killer was by the window.

14:24.608 --> 14:26.260
The body was moved.

14:26.304 --> 14:27.391
It gets even better.

14:27.434 --> 14:28.565
Here, hold her.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Aw.

14:35.043 --> 14:38.043
You guys look
cute together.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.347
So...

14:39.391 --> 14:41.913
the nine-millimeter bullet
that Ducky found

14:41.956 --> 14:44.130
has similar characteristics
to those that are fired

14:44.173 --> 14:46.695
from an MP-5 submachine gun.

14:46.739 --> 14:49.695
If our killer was
standing 15 feet away,

14:49.739 --> 14:51.347
then the groupings
of bullets...

14:51.391 --> 14:52.826
Would be closer together.

14:52.869 --> 14:54.565
The body would be more torn up.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.217
Yeah, and it's not.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.043
I mean, the bullets are
several inches apart.

14:58.086 --> 15:01.695
One to the neck, chest,
and stomach.

15:01.739 --> 15:02.739
Yeah, which means what,

15:02.782 --> 15:04.000
that the killer
was farther away?

15:04.043 --> 15:05.434
Not even in the
same building.

15:05.478 --> 15:06.956
[dummy thuds]Where?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.826
ABBY: A rooftop across the
street from the loft.

15:09.869 --> 15:12.304
I pinpointed an address.

15:12.347 --> 15:15.000
1537 Windham Street.

15:15.043 --> 15:17.000
GIBBS:
Thanks, Abbs.

15:17.043 --> 15:18.086
[phone beeps, line rings]DiNozzo.

15:18.130 --> 15:19.434
Yeah, boss?

15:19.478 --> 15:20.956
Need you to take a second look
at the crime scene.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.956
TONY:
According to Abby's

15:24.000 --> 15:25.956
GPS coordinates,

15:26.000 --> 15:27.304
the killer was standing
over there.

15:27.347 --> 15:28.478
I don't see any footprints.

15:28.521 --> 15:29.913
Yeah, knew not to
leave a trace.

15:29.956 --> 15:31.782
Yeah, unlike some people.

15:31.826 --> 15:33.826
You know, I'm gonna start
charging your boyfriend minutes.

15:33.869 --> 15:35.956
Please tell me you have
not spoken to Ray.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.260
Okay, I haven't spoken to Ray.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.913
Unbelievable, you're
supposed to be on my side.

15:38.956 --> 15:40.217
Look,

15:40.260 --> 15:42.173
the guy is desperate;
what am I supposed to do?

15:42.217 --> 15:43.391
Stay out of it.

15:43.434 --> 15:44.521
[sighs]

15:44.565 --> 15:46.086
Tell me what happened.

15:46.130 --> 15:49.043
He does not appreciate me.

15:49.086 --> 15:50.608
There.

15:50.652 --> 15:54.043
If I had a dollar for every
time a woman said that to me...

15:54.086 --> 15:56.826
[laughs]

15:56.869 --> 15:58.000
While he was
overseas, you know,

15:58.043 --> 15:59.782
we stayed connected
as best we could,

15:59.826 --> 16:01.000
trying to make
whatever we had,

16:01.043 --> 16:02.956
you know, just
work, and now

16:03.000 --> 16:05.565
he was finally
back, and, uh...

16:05.608 --> 16:08.608
we planned this-this
lovely dinner.

16:11.000 --> 16:16.043
But he never showed, Tony.

16:16.086 --> 16:19.608
I waited in that restaurant,
alone, for three hours.

16:19.652 --> 16:21.956
No text, no call, nothing.

16:24.869 --> 16:26.000
[sighs]

16:26.043 --> 16:27.086
When I saw him next,

16:27.130 --> 16:29.347
it was just the
following morning,

16:29.391 --> 16:33.086
and then he just said he
"got caught up with work."

16:33.130 --> 16:35.086
Well...Look, it just

16:35.130 --> 16:36.608
brought me back to
when I was young.

16:36.652 --> 16:38.826
How my father could be.

16:38.869 --> 16:40.913
There was always
something more important,

16:40.956 --> 16:44.869
and I was always
left waiting for s...

16:48.304 --> 16:49.652
There's someone there.

16:49.695 --> 16:52.608
TONY:
Yeah.

16:52.652 --> 16:54.608
Let's go.

17:03.869 --> 17:05.391
ZIVA:
NCIS! Freeze!

17:05.434 --> 17:07.086
Put your hands
in the air! Now!

17:07.130 --> 17:09.173
Turn around!

17:09.217 --> 17:10.521
Turn around!

17:11.652 --> 17:13.043
Oh, come on.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.913
ZIVA:
Federal agents! Stop!

17:21.434 --> 17:22.826
TONY: Why do they
always run away?

17:30.956 --> 17:32.913
[panting]

17:32.956 --> 17:34.217
[grunts]

17:39.652 --> 17:41.086
[panting]

17:49.043 --> 17:51.000
Hello!

17:53.304 --> 17:54.478
Are you kidding me?

18:02.086 --> 18:03.782
What were you doing at the
crime scene, Detective?

18:03.826 --> 18:06.478
What I've been doing every day
for the past 13 years,

18:06.521 --> 18:08.478
I was solving a case.Wasn't yours to solve.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.739
You know what,
I'm not gonna sleep

18:09.782 --> 18:11.086
until I find Maya's killer.

18:11.130 --> 18:13.043
And I don't trust anybody
else to do this job,

18:13.086 --> 18:14.434
especially a bunch
of Navy cops.

18:14.478 --> 18:17.434
GIBBS:
You think we're not doing
all we can?

18:17.478 --> 18:18.608
I think you don't have a clue

18:18.652 --> 18:20.217
how it feels to lose
the one you love.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.695
You're wrong.

18:23.521 --> 18:26.043
Sit down.

18:29.478 --> 18:32.869
[groans]

18:32.913 --> 18:36.608
GIBBS:
Tell me about this.

18:36.652 --> 18:37.739
What about it?

18:37.782 --> 18:39.304
GIBBS:
Well, it doesn't look good,

18:39.347 --> 18:40.739
you spending money
you don't have.

18:40.782 --> 18:41.956
What's that supposed to mean?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.260
We know about the
insurance policy.

18:44.304 --> 18:45.913
We know about how
much you're due.

18:49.478 --> 18:51.913
Look, I didn't...
I didn't buy that, Maya did.

18:51.956 --> 18:55.000
My dream for us

18:55.043 --> 18:57.304
was to live on a, uh,
on a boat someday.

18:57.347 --> 19:01.086
And then out of nowhere,
she-she surprises me last month.

19:01.130 --> 19:02.695
And now it sits in
my driveway,

19:02.739 --> 19:05.826
And when I look at it,
I... I see her.

19:05.869 --> 19:08.217
I see the...

19:08.260 --> 19:10.043
I see the trips
we were gonna take,

19:10.086 --> 19:13.217
and the kids we wanted to have.

19:16.565 --> 19:20.043
Our jobs kept us apart, but...

19:20.086 --> 19:21.521
the time that we spend together,

19:21.565 --> 19:23.391
it-it was... it special.

19:23.434 --> 19:24.434
You know?

19:24.478 --> 19:26.478
We never took it
for granted, ever.

19:26.521 --> 19:27.652
And I would do anything,

19:27.695 --> 19:29.086
I would give anything
to just have...

19:29.130 --> 19:31.043
more of that.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.913
You understand?

19:35.956 --> 19:38.173
Did she, uh,

19:38.217 --> 19:40.217
she spend money
like this before?

19:40.260 --> 19:43.391
No, no, Maya was... she
was pretty conservative.

19:43.434 --> 19:46.521
She do anything else out
of the ordinary lately?

19:46.565 --> 19:48.043
She scared?
She nervous?

19:48.086 --> 19:49.652
No, she would've...

19:49.695 --> 19:52.086
I mean, she would've told me
if there was anything was wrong.

19:52.130 --> 19:53.304
We-we talked about everything.

19:53.347 --> 19:55.000
Sometimes couples keep secrets.

19:55.043 --> 19:56.043
Not us.

19:56.086 --> 19:58.304
No way.

20:07.043 --> 20:09.173
McGee confirmed that
only the commander's name

20:09.217 --> 20:10.869
was on the sales
contract for the boat.

20:10.913 --> 20:13.260
Put down more than
$10,000 in cash.

20:13.304 --> 20:14.260
Where'd she get the money?

20:14.304 --> 20:15.565
Find her superior.

20:15.608 --> 20:17.608
He might know.

20:19.608 --> 20:22.913
Got a location on
Ambassador James Ealy.

20:22.956 --> 20:24.347
Just returned to Cairo.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.304
Put him up.

20:27.130 --> 20:28.391
Evening, Ambassador.

20:28.434 --> 20:31.434
Mm. Think you mean
"Good morning."

20:31.478 --> 20:32.521
GIBBS:
Tell me about Lieutenant

20:32.565 --> 20:34.695
Commander Maya Burris.EALY:
Ah.

20:34.739 --> 20:37.739
We're all still in shock over
here about what's happened.

20:37.782 --> 20:40.086
What can you tell us about
her most recent assignment?

20:40.130 --> 20:42.391
Well, Commander Burris often
had multiple assignments.

20:42.434 --> 20:44.782
Uh, she was one of our
top Naval attachés.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.782
Uh, she worked with coordinating
high-level meetings

20:46.826 --> 20:49.478
with various officials
throughout the Middle East

20:49.521 --> 20:50.869
and Africa.

20:50.913 --> 20:52.478
You know about her
trips to Pakistan?

20:52.521 --> 20:54.130
Yes, she traveled
there often.

20:54.173 --> 20:58.260
Yes, uh, mainly for de-briefings
with our embassy in Islamabad.

20:58.304 --> 21:00.173
Was she following someone?

21:00.217 --> 21:02.521
[sighs]

21:02.565 --> 21:06.000
If she was, I didn't
know about it.

21:06.043 --> 21:09.000
Lately, all she
talked about was...

21:09.043 --> 21:11.391
getting home to her husband.

21:13.782 --> 21:16.391
MCGEE:
Boss, the State Department
just transmitted photos

21:16.434 --> 21:19.652
taken by security cameras near
the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.434
Found several capturing
Commander Burris.

21:21.478 --> 21:23.521
When?Two weeks ago.

21:23.565 --> 21:25.478
And she was
with someone-- a man.

21:25.521 --> 21:26.956
Go on, put it up.

21:31.000 --> 21:32.826
Not exactly a
friendly chit-chat.

21:32.869 --> 21:35.043
ZIVA:
She is clearly afraid of him.

21:35.086 --> 21:36.347
Maybe she's headed back
toward the embassy.

21:36.391 --> 21:37.869
Could have been going for help.

21:37.913 --> 21:40.043
McGee, the last photo,
isolate it.

21:41.782 --> 21:43.478
TONY:
Hard to make out a face, boss.

21:43.521 --> 21:45.173
No, not the face.
Closer.

21:45.217 --> 21:47.217
Close-up on his ear.

21:51.304 --> 21:52.434
That's a wireless headset.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.130
I may be able
to trace the signal.

21:54.173 --> 21:55.782
Do it. Find Abby.

21:55.826 --> 21:57.782
[phone ringing]Got it, boss.

21:59.173 --> 22:00.869
Hey, it's Detective
Burris again.

22:00.913 --> 22:02.304
Third time
he's called today.

22:02.347 --> 22:03.217
He's not letting up.

22:03.260 --> 22:04.304
What do you want me to do?

22:04.347 --> 22:05.260
Nothing. I'll talk to him.

22:05.304 --> 22:07.478
Sure that's a good idea?

22:07.521 --> 22:09.260
You got a better idea, DiNozzo?

22:09.304 --> 22:11.043
Sorry. That came out wrong.

22:11.086 --> 22:13.652
Well, I think I might.

22:13.695 --> 22:16.130
Worked with a lot of guys
like this in Baltimore.

22:16.173 --> 22:18.173
Can I give it a try?

22:22.173 --> 22:24.565
You know, just-just tell me
you got the S.O.B.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.478
Well, tell me you got...
you got something.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.260
You know, you're pursuing
good leads.

22:30.304 --> 22:32.565
You got to trust
we're doing all we can.

22:32.608 --> 22:34.260
I'm going crazy here.

22:34.304 --> 22:37.434
I'm just sitting on my hands,
waiting for something to happen.

22:37.478 --> 22:40.173
You know what?
It's-It's not how I'm built.

22:40.217 --> 22:41.826
I get it.

22:41.869 --> 22:44.304
Your life is about
the next case, right?

22:44.347 --> 22:46.130
Won't sleep
until you solve it?

22:48.652 --> 22:51.782
It's all I ever wanted
to be was to be a cop.

22:51.826 --> 22:54.434
You know, work homicide.

22:54.478 --> 22:56.434
Nothing better
than giving the...

22:56.478 --> 22:59.391
victim's family some peace.

22:59.434 --> 23:01.608
Right? Justice? But...

23:01.652 --> 23:05.869
I'm doing this job,
you-you see so many bodies.

23:05.913 --> 23:07.869
You start...

23:07.913 --> 23:10.869
You start to get twisted,
you know, angry.

23:10.913 --> 23:13.391
Most of cases you know
you're never gonna solve.

23:13.434 --> 23:15.565
I mean, after a while, you...

23:15.608 --> 23:17.826
you know, you disconnect.

23:17.869 --> 23:19.391
You have to.

23:19.434 --> 23:21.434
Those bodies-- they're...

23:21.478 --> 23:23.956
they're not people anymore.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.739
They're just...

23:25.782 --> 23:27.347
Case numbers.

23:27.391 --> 23:29.521
Puzzles to solve.

23:29.565 --> 23:31.347
Yeah.

23:31.391 --> 23:33.565
Till you show up one day
on the scene,

23:33.608 --> 23:35.956
and that body is your...

23:38.260 --> 23:41.217
[sighs, groans]

23:41.260 --> 23:43.956
Well, look, you're on
the other side now, Nick, so...

23:47.086 --> 23:49.304
...you gotta
let yourself grieve.

23:49.347 --> 23:51.521
Let us do the
work, all right?

23:54.608 --> 23:56.347
[sighs]

23:56.391 --> 23:58.217
So, uh, where were you?

23:58.260 --> 24:00.434
Baltimore.

24:00.478 --> 24:01.565
Philly before that.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.043
Yeah. You ever marry?

24:03.086 --> 24:06.521
Almost. Once.

24:06.565 --> 24:09.000
Let me guess--
she hated you being a cop.

24:09.043 --> 24:12.608
Told you it was the one thing
that you loved more than her.

24:12.652 --> 24:15.000
It was that
and the red wine... I think.

24:15.043 --> 24:16.304
[laughs]

24:16.347 --> 24:19.043
All right, I gotta
get back.

24:19.086 --> 24:21.434
[groans]

24:21.478 --> 24:23.217
I'll keep you posted, all right?

24:23.260 --> 24:24.826
Agent DiNozzo?

24:24.869 --> 24:27.043
Yesterday, I, uh,

24:27.086 --> 24:29.000
tore this place apart looking
for something.

24:29.043 --> 24:30.652
I didn't find much, but...

24:30.695 --> 24:32.478
there's this.

24:32.521 --> 24:34.695
I don't recognize the name.

24:39.086 --> 24:42.086
Thanks.

24:46.565 --> 24:48.782
Commander Burris knew Ray.

24:48.826 --> 24:50.260
Maybe tried reaching out to him.

24:51.304 --> 24:53.173
Ziva?

24:53.217 --> 24:55.217
Look, we need to find out

24:55.260 --> 24:57.043
if he worked
with the commander overseas.

24:57.086 --> 25:00.173
Maybe he can tell us something
about her travels to Pakistan.

25:02.217 --> 25:04.521
Ziva, we need to talk to him.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.130
I'll go.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.173
Alone.

25:14.086 --> 25:16.043
[sighs]

25:19.391 --> 25:20.521
You're still mad.

25:20.565 --> 25:22.608
I'm not here for that.

25:22.652 --> 25:24.652
We need to talk
about Commander Burris.

25:26.695 --> 25:29.000
It's terrible
what happened to her.

25:29.043 --> 25:31.434
She was a real asset
to ONI and State.

25:31.478 --> 25:32.826
So, did you work with her?

25:32.869 --> 25:34.086
On my last
assignment overseas.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.869
She set up meetings
and ran interference.

25:36.913 --> 25:39.347
Most recently with the
ambassador in Cairo last month.

25:39.391 --> 25:42.086
Why?
And that was when
you last spoke?

25:42.130 --> 25:44.347
Yes. Ziva...

25:44.391 --> 25:47.260
you know I'm not supposed to
talk to you about this stuff.

25:47.304 --> 25:49.434
We know she was traveling
with a man.

25:49.478 --> 25:51.043
Any idea who he could be?

25:51.086 --> 25:54.478
No clue-- and even if I did,
I wouldn't be able to tell you.

25:54.521 --> 25:56.478
Mm-hmm.

25:56.521 --> 25:58.652
Fine.

25:58.695 --> 26:01.347
Then we are through here.
Thank you.

26:01.391 --> 26:03.652
Are you gonna
keep punishing me?

26:03.695 --> 26:04.782
'Cause it's killing me.

26:04.826 --> 26:06.391
Oh, so you're
the one in pain!

26:06.434 --> 26:08.434
Because I don't recall me
leaving you at the restaurant!

26:08.478 --> 26:10.391
Ziva, I messed up.
I'm sorry.

26:10.434 --> 26:11.521
You were not there, Ray.

26:11.565 --> 26:12.782
I'm here now.

26:12.826 --> 26:14.782
It was one screw-up.

26:14.826 --> 26:17.521
Don't throw away everything
we have over one screw-up.

26:17.565 --> 26:19.739
It's not just
about a screw-up.

26:19.782 --> 26:21.739
You do not care.

26:21.782 --> 26:24.304
That is not true.

26:24.347 --> 26:26.260
Look at you.

26:26.304 --> 26:28.739
Putting up walls again.
You do it with me.

26:28.782 --> 26:30.130
You did it with
your father...

26:30.173 --> 26:31.304
Don't. It's not
about my father.

26:31.347 --> 26:34.521
Ziva, I'm never gonna
hurt you again.

26:34.565 --> 26:36.565
Give me another chance.

26:39.260 --> 26:41.260
It's too late.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.434
I love you.

26:55.521 --> 26:58.043
Now or never.

26:58.086 --> 26:59.869
Ziva David,

26:59.913 --> 27:02.260
will you marry me?

27:03.304 --> 27:05.521
[sighs]

27:16.043 --> 27:18.043
[sighs, laughs]

27:18.086 --> 27:19.043
[whispers]:
Get up.

27:19.086 --> 27:20.652
Not until you say yes.

27:20.695 --> 27:22.347
Get up. Just get...

27:22.391 --> 27:24.173
This is embarrassing.
Get up!

27:24.217 --> 27:25.347
So you don't want
to marry me?

27:25.391 --> 27:26.608
That's not
what I said!

27:26.652 --> 27:28.043
Is this your way of
making it up to me?

27:28.086 --> 27:29.434
No, of course not.
I was planning

27:29.478 --> 27:31.043
on asking you to marry me
that night at that dinner.

27:31.086 --> 27:32.478
This is what
I want, Ziva.

27:32.521 --> 27:34.043
Okay, so, what about
the next time you stand me up?

27:34.086 --> 27:36.260
Or the next time you leave
the country for months on end?

27:36.304 --> 27:38.043
Look at me.
It's never gonna happen again.

27:38.086 --> 27:39.000
You've said that
before, Ray.

27:39.043 --> 27:40.173
I've applied for desk duty.

27:40.217 --> 27:42.043
Did something happen?
No.

27:42.086 --> 27:43.869
It's just
what I want.

27:43.913 --> 27:45.565
I'm back.

27:45.608 --> 27:47.565
I want a life with you,

27:47.608 --> 27:49.521
in a big house in
Virginia somewhere,

27:49.565 --> 27:51.869
with a big garden.

27:51.913 --> 27:54.043
And I want to have two kids,
maybe three.

27:54.086 --> 27:57.000
And I want them to have
your beautiful eyes.

27:58.869 --> 28:01.260
Marry me.

28:10.869 --> 28:15.391
So... what did
C.I.-Ray have to say?

28:15.434 --> 28:16.608
He has not had contact

28:16.652 --> 28:18.043
with Commander Burris
in over a month.

28:18.086 --> 28:19.739
Not talking about the case.

28:19.782 --> 28:21.260
Spill it.

28:21.304 --> 28:23.304
Did he go all
Rico Suave on you?

28:23.347 --> 28:24.826
Flowers, down on one knee?

28:26.826 --> 28:29.478
You knew
Ray was going to propose?

28:29.521 --> 28:31.130
Marriage proposal's
a sacred thing.

28:31.173 --> 28:33.347
If a guy tells you he's gonna
do it, you hold that close.

28:33.391 --> 28:35.260
It's an unwritten
code all men live by.

28:35.304 --> 28:36.478
Where's the rock?

28:36.521 --> 28:39.304
I told him I would have
to think about it.

28:39.347 --> 28:40.652
[gasps]

28:40.695 --> 28:42.043
That's the kiss of death, Ziva.

28:42.086 --> 28:43.391
I did not say no.

28:43.434 --> 28:45.826
I just have to make sure
that I am ready.

28:45.869 --> 28:47.043
That we are both ready.

28:47.086 --> 28:49.043
Nobody's ready for
marriage, trust me.

28:49.086 --> 28:51.913
If they were, the divorce rate
wouldn't be 50%.

28:51.956 --> 28:53.260
Not to mention the murder rate.

28:53.304 --> 28:56.043
Oh, you're really helping.
Thanks.

28:56.086 --> 28:58.043
Getting married

28:58.086 --> 29:01.608
is a leap of
faith, right?

29:01.652 --> 29:03.434
Is Ray the right
guy for you?

29:03.478 --> 29:05.434
Maybe. Maybe not.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.130
But if you love
him, you...

29:07.173 --> 29:09.173
you got to jump in,
feet first.

29:09.217 --> 29:10.434
Hmm. This coming from the man

29:10.478 --> 29:12.217
who did not even go through
with his

29:12.260 --> 29:13.608
own little wedding.

29:13.652 --> 29:15.000
Ah, but I killed the proposal.

29:15.043 --> 29:16.173
Should have seen me.

29:16.217 --> 29:18.826
Rocked a tuxedo,
set out the candles.

29:18.869 --> 29:20.130
I even managed
to shed a tear.

29:20.173 --> 29:23.086
GIBBS:
Something you want
to share, DiNozzo?

29:23.130 --> 29:25.043
No, not really, boss, but, uh...

29:25.086 --> 29:26.652
Hey, you should
be getting ready

29:26.695 --> 29:28.260
to, uh, play
Father of the Bride.

29:28.304 --> 29:31.000
I'd base it on the
Spencer Tracy classic.

29:31.043 --> 29:32.130
Skip the Steve Martin.

29:32.173 --> 29:34.173
Yeah?

29:35.782 --> 29:38.086
I'm happy for you, Ziva.

29:38.130 --> 29:39.304
[laughs]

29:39.347 --> 29:41.086
I did not
exactly say yes,

29:41.130 --> 29:43.304
so... it is not
exactly official.

29:43.347 --> 29:45.913
Well, it will be
if it's right.

29:45.956 --> 29:47.043
[gasps]

29:47.086 --> 29:48.695
You and Jimmy Palmer.

29:48.739 --> 29:50.086
Double wedding!
[laughter]

29:50.130 --> 29:51.304
ABBY:
Okay, whatever you guys

29:51.347 --> 29:52.782
are talking about
right now,

29:52.826 --> 29:54.521
stop, 'cause it couldn't
possibly be as important

29:54.565 --> 29:56.565
as what me and McGee
have to tell you.

29:56.608 --> 29:58.173
Go, Abbs.We searched

29:58.217 --> 30:00.782
the databases of every
wireless earpiece manufacturer

30:00.826 --> 30:04.217
from here to Timbuktu, and we
came up with a match. Hit it.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.173
It's called
the DX-1200.

30:07.217 --> 30:09.173
It's made by a company
outside Phoenix

30:09.217 --> 30:10.956
that specializes in devices

30:11.000 --> 30:12.739
for high-security
government lines.

30:12.782 --> 30:14.391
ABBY: That means
those lines are harder

30:14.434 --> 30:16.086
to trace or hack
or otherwise compromise.

30:16.130 --> 30:19.652
Only 400 of this specific model
are registered in the world.

30:19.695 --> 30:21.086
Most are in
the Middle East.

30:21.130 --> 30:23.130
Could be someone
in Pakistan.You got a name?

30:23.173 --> 30:25.739
Uh, nothing yet,
but we do have this.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.217
ABBY:
A scan of the commander's

30:28.260 --> 30:29.565
browser history
showed multiple

30:29.608 --> 30:32.347
searches for the Saleh
Revolutionary Corps,

30:32.391 --> 30:34.130
or SRC,
during the past month.

30:34.173 --> 30:35.782
McGEE: If this is who
she was tracking,

30:35.826 --> 30:38.217
she must have more intel than
some week-old browser search.

30:38.260 --> 30:40.826
Question is-- where?

30:40.869 --> 30:42.782
One place we
haven't checked.

30:42.826 --> 30:45.782
BURRIS: I'm not sure what you're
looking for, Agent Gibbs,

30:45.826 --> 30:47.478
but Maya wouldn't hide
anything on the boat.

30:47.521 --> 30:50.130
I mean, she barely
spent any time here.

30:51.695 --> 30:53.652
Well, look, I, uh...
look, I know how hard

30:53.695 --> 30:54.869
you're working
on this case.

30:54.913 --> 30:56.086
I meant no disrespect.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.043
None taken.

30:58.086 --> 31:01.043
[Burris speaking indistinctly]

31:01.086 --> 31:03.130
BURRIS:
I'll do whatever I can to help.

31:07.869 --> 31:09.000
Found something!

31:10.000 --> 31:12.173
Bring it up.You ever seen this?

31:12.217 --> 31:13.739
No. Never.

31:13.782 --> 31:15.217
Let's open it.

31:20.043 --> 31:24.043
It's all about the Saleh
Revolutionary Corps.

31:24.086 --> 31:25.739
The who?

31:25.782 --> 31:27.086
We believe that your wife

31:27.130 --> 31:28.869
was tracking a known
terrorist group.

31:28.913 --> 31:31.043
Is this her
handwriting?

31:31.086 --> 31:34.000
She was in trouble, wasn't she?

31:34.043 --> 31:36.652
[sighs]
Yeah.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.652
Why wouldn't she tell me?

31:38.695 --> 31:40.869
We protect
who we love.

31:43.739 --> 31:46.086
Okay, Abbs, talk to me.
What do you got?

31:46.130 --> 31:48.000
Believe it or not,
I'm not the one

31:48.043 --> 31:49.521
doing all the talking
this time, Gibbs.

31:49.565 --> 31:52.086
Commander Burris is.
She has a lot to say.

31:52.130 --> 31:54.608
Journals tell us she began
working with a former colleague

31:54.652 --> 31:56.478
to help take down the SRC.

31:56.521 --> 31:58.782
Okay, it breaks down
like this.

31:58.826 --> 32:01.304
Her first entry
was on December 17.

32:01.347 --> 32:04.782
It was also the same day
as her first trip to Islamabad.

32:04.826 --> 32:06.956
On December 30, she goes back.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.173
But something happened.

32:08.217 --> 32:10.086
She got scared.

32:10.130 --> 32:12.043
"I shouldn't have gotten
involved.

32:12.086 --> 32:13.478
"I'm in danger now.

32:13.521 --> 32:15.913
Things could turn ugly fast."

32:15.956 --> 32:17.608
Threat from SRC?

32:17.652 --> 32:20.043
No. From a former colleague.

32:21.347 --> 32:25.130
By cross-referencing dates
and locations of her travels

32:25.173 --> 32:28.086
with the cell signals
of various DX-1200 earpieces,

32:28.130 --> 32:29.913
we were able
to narrow it down

32:29.956 --> 32:31.130
to one signal.

32:33.217 --> 32:34.217
The itineraries
completely match.

32:34.260 --> 32:35.391
You got an I.D.?

32:35.434 --> 32:37.391
Yeah.

32:37.434 --> 32:39.391
Barry Norton.

32:39.434 --> 32:41.826
Stationed in Pakistan
as a civil engineer in 1998.

32:41.869 --> 32:45.130
Began working as a liaison
for the Cairo Embassy

32:45.173 --> 32:46.826
in 2003.

32:46.869 --> 32:47.869
Recently fired.

32:47.913 --> 32:49.086
For what?

32:49.130 --> 32:51.826
Fraternizing with
anti-American terrorists.

32:51.869 --> 32:53.304
Most notably, the SRC.

32:53.347 --> 32:55.652
But after Norton was fired,
he took it one step further.

32:55.695 --> 32:57.782
He started working
with the bad guys.

32:57.826 --> 32:59.739
McGEE:
Sold them government secrets.

32:59.782 --> 33:00.913
Accessed the commander's

33:00.956 --> 33:02.739
high-level security privileges
to do it.

33:02.782 --> 33:04.608
Used her.
ABBY:
Yeah.

33:04.652 --> 33:06.652
And when she found
out, she flipped.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.043
She told Norton
that she was

33:08.086 --> 33:09.434
gonna go public
with what she knew.

33:09.478 --> 33:10.869
Killed her before she could.

33:10.913 --> 33:13.000
McGEE: Also tracked down
the contractor from the loft.

33:13.043 --> 33:14.391
He's Norton's cousin.

33:14.434 --> 33:15.695
Then he had access.

33:15.739 --> 33:16.739
Location?

33:16.782 --> 33:18.391
Cell phone's off, but I did get

33:18.434 --> 33:20.869
a hit on a car registered
in Norton's name.

33:20.913 --> 33:23.130
It was issued a parking ticket
last week in Georgetown.

33:23.173 --> 33:24.173
Put out a BOLO.

33:26.608 --> 33:27.739
[laughs]

33:27.782 --> 33:29.739
No, no, that sounds
completely crazy,

33:29.782 --> 33:31.521
but okay.

33:31.565 --> 33:33.043
We can talk
later about it.

33:33.086 --> 33:34.000
Sure, Ray.

33:34.043 --> 33:36.521
Okay, bye.

33:36.565 --> 33:38.304
Jumping in feet first, David?

33:38.347 --> 33:39.304
[sighs]

33:39.347 --> 33:41.043
Ray is renting a jet.

33:41.086 --> 33:44.130
He wants me to fly to Miami
tomorrow to tell his parents.

33:44.173 --> 33:47.043
And I am seriously
considering it.

33:47.086 --> 33:49.826
Wow! Oh.

33:49.869 --> 33:51.869
Great.

33:51.913 --> 33:54.478
So why the shift?

33:58.217 --> 34:01.043
Seeing Detective Burris.

34:01.086 --> 34:03.739
How much he still
loves his wife.

34:03.782 --> 34:07.086
How he just wishes he had
one more day with her.

34:07.130 --> 34:10.173
I guess, I just, I don't
want to live with regrets.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.347
You know?

34:11.391 --> 34:14.478
GIBBS:
Ziva, DiNozzo, squad room.

34:14.521 --> 34:16.000
Go, McGee.

34:16.043 --> 34:19.130
State police tracked down
Norton's car.

34:19.173 --> 34:20.695
He was involved in an
accident last night.

34:20.739 --> 34:21.695
Where?

34:21.739 --> 34:23.260
Corner of 16th and Bell.

34:23.304 --> 34:25.173
Bring him in.

34:30.739 --> 34:33.608
McGee, I said Norton.

34:33.652 --> 34:35.173
Not his car.

34:35.217 --> 34:36.652
Uh, boss, he's at the morgue.

34:36.695 --> 34:38.043
Was pronounced dead
at Washington General

34:38.086 --> 34:40.043
at 11:34 last night.

34:49.043 --> 34:52.173
ABBY:
Gibbs, Norton's brakes
were definitely...

34:52.217 --> 34:54.000
I can't hear you, Abbs.

34:55.434 --> 34:57.043
Sorry, Gibbs.

34:57.086 --> 34:59.086
It's hard to hear me when I'm
all jammed up underneath there.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.956
I was trying to tell you
that Norton's brakes

35:02.000 --> 35:03.086
were definitely tampered with.

35:03.130 --> 35:05.260
More like completely destroyed.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.478
Cut the line?

35:06.521 --> 35:08.434
In three different places.

35:08.478 --> 35:12.086
Someone wanted to make sure
he couldn't stop.

35:12.130 --> 35:14.478
Wanted to make
sure he was dead.

35:14.521 --> 35:17.260
DIA just confirmed that
the Saleh Revolutionary Corps

35:17.304 --> 35:18.739
placed a fatwa on Barry Norton.

35:18.782 --> 35:20.043
When?

35:20.086 --> 35:21.434
Two weeks ago.

35:21.478 --> 35:22.782
Surveillance in Islamabad said

35:22.826 --> 35:24.652
there was some kind of argument
over money.

35:24.695 --> 35:25.739
He got greedy.

35:25.782 --> 35:27.347
Apparently, he was
quoted as saying

35:27.391 --> 35:28.826
if they didn't
pay him what he wanted,

35:28.869 --> 35:30.652
he'd expose the strategy
for their next mission.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.608
Norton must have been
the target all along.

35:32.652 --> 35:33.913
McGEE:
And the commander was

35:33.956 --> 35:35.608
collateral damage
from the first failed hit.

35:35.652 --> 35:37.869
McGee, Norton's
cell phone history now.

35:37.913 --> 35:39.217
Okay.

35:40.478 --> 35:42.086
Calls made in Islamabad.

36:03.739 --> 36:05.086
Ziva.

36:07.130 --> 36:09.043
Where you going?

36:09.086 --> 36:10.521
Do not try to stop me, Gibbs.

36:10.565 --> 36:11.695
I have something to do.

36:16.695 --> 36:17.826
Ziva, you're here!

36:17.869 --> 36:19.217
This is totally exciting.

36:19.260 --> 36:22.739
And I am weirdly gifted
at wedding planning.

36:22.782 --> 36:23.826
That is not why I came.

36:23.869 --> 36:25.347
I need your help
with something else.

36:25.391 --> 36:27.000
Okay. What?

36:27.043 --> 36:29.695
Can you access old voice mails
and text messages on my phone?

36:29.739 --> 36:31.043
Of course.
How far back?

36:31.086 --> 36:33.173
A month. Maybe two.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.608
Okay, you have a really
strange look on your face,

36:38.652 --> 36:39.956
and it's kind
of scaring me.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.086
What is this about?

36:41.130 --> 36:42.782
Abby, just do it.

36:46.739 --> 36:48.782
Once I input your number,
I'll be able to access

36:48.826 --> 36:50.608
the server's mainframe
and pull the records from there.

36:50.652 --> 36:52.521
Might take a second.

36:54.826 --> 36:58.000
All right, I'm in.

36:58.043 --> 37:01.043
Bringing up all your phone calls
from the past two months.

37:01.086 --> 37:01.913
There.

37:01.956 --> 37:03.521
Bring up just
those calls.

37:05.434 --> 37:08.739
Cross-reference with Norton's
phone activity in Pakistan.

37:13.434 --> 37:14.913
All calls were made
in Islamabad.

37:14.956 --> 37:17.000
The caller was
in the same place as Norton.

37:20.043 --> 37:21.869
Thank you.

37:29.869 --> 37:32.217
There you are.

37:32.260 --> 37:33.695
Where are your bags?

37:38.652 --> 37:40.391
Now you have my answer.

37:40.434 --> 37:42.478
Let me explain.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.043
There is nothing
to explain.

37:44.086 --> 37:45.173
You killed an innocent woman,

37:45.217 --> 37:46.869
and then you tried
to lie to me about it.

37:46.913 --> 37:48.434
It's not like that.

37:48.478 --> 37:50.217
When I saw your number,
I knew.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.521
Did you think you could
get away with it?

37:52.565 --> 37:54.260
The commander wasn't
supposed to be there.

37:54.304 --> 37:56.260
Norton was my target.

37:56.304 --> 37:57.347
She was a mistake.

37:57.391 --> 37:59.000
One you took great pains
to cover up.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.782
Ziva, you have to understand,

38:01.826 --> 38:05.434
Norton was
a very dangerous man.

38:05.478 --> 38:07.391
I had orders to take him out
in Pakistan,

38:07.434 --> 38:09.478
but unfortunately, he fled
the country on an alias

38:09.521 --> 38:11.347
before I could get to him.

38:11.391 --> 38:14.043
I wasn't gonna let him get away
a second time.

38:14.086 --> 38:16.000
He needed to
be handled,

38:16.043 --> 38:19.304
and I didn't care if he was on
U.S. soil or not, Ziva.

38:19.347 --> 38:22.869
American lives were at stake.

38:22.913 --> 38:24.521
So I handled him.

38:24.565 --> 38:26.956
You went against your superiors.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.521
I did what I had to do.

38:30.565 --> 38:32.347
You of all people
should understand that.

38:34.391 --> 38:36.521
Norton's gone, Ziva.

38:36.565 --> 38:38.695
It's over.

38:38.739 --> 38:42.695
It will never be over
for Commander Burris's husband.

38:42.739 --> 38:44.217
You ruined his life, Ray.

38:44.260 --> 38:45.739
Do you not understand that?

38:45.782 --> 38:46.913
Enough.

38:46.956 --> 38:49.826
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

38:51.434 --> 38:53.086
I made mistakes.

38:53.130 --> 38:55.173
And what's done is done.

38:55.217 --> 38:56.826
Now I just want to go back

38:56.869 --> 38:59.739
to being the man that I used
to be before all of this...

39:01.695 --> 39:03.695
...the man you fell
in love with.

39:06.913 --> 39:09.086
That man is gone.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.869
CIA confirms that
Ray violated orders

39:30.913 --> 39:33.043
by taking out Norton
on U.S. soil.

39:35.086 --> 39:37.304
He's done.

39:41.739 --> 39:43.739
What can I do?

39:43.782 --> 39:46.565
Drive.

39:46.608 --> 39:48.608
Just drive.

40:05.173 --> 40:08.130
You know, you should let McGee
take care of that tech stuff.

40:08.173 --> 40:10.130
I can handle it, Tony.
Thank you.

40:11.652 --> 40:14.956
Why is this thing
not even turning on?!

40:15.000 --> 40:17.608
It's okay to ask
for help, you know.

40:17.652 --> 40:19.173
Do not need help, Tony.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.478
I am fine.

40:20.521 --> 40:22.391
Uh-huh.

40:23.391 --> 40:24.434
I can see that.

40:24.478 --> 40:25.608
Give it to me.

40:30.173 --> 40:32.608
Listen, don't beat yourself up.

40:32.652 --> 40:35.217
There's no way you
could've seen it coming.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.956
No way any of us could've
seen that coming.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.000
You'll find
somebody, someday.

40:44.565 --> 40:46.695
I'm not sure I want to.

40:46.739 --> 40:48.260
I do not think, uh,
children and marriage

40:48.304 --> 40:50.173
are part of the plan
for me right now.

40:50.217 --> 40:51.782
And I am fine with that.

40:51.826 --> 40:55.565
Perfectly... perfectly content
with my life.

40:55.608 --> 40:56.826
Hmm.

40:56.869 --> 40:58.782
Content, but
are you happy?

40:59.826 --> 41:01.782
Are you?

41:04.086 --> 41:05.391
[cell phone chimes]

41:05.434 --> 41:06.956
[chuckles]

41:08.652 --> 41:09.652
Detective Burris.

41:09.695 --> 41:11.782
Sorry. I-I know it's late.

41:11.826 --> 41:14.565
I just needed to hear you
say it in person.

41:14.608 --> 41:18.478
You guys got the guy
who killed Maya?

41:18.521 --> 41:19.695
Yeah, it's over.

41:19.739 --> 41:21.956
We, uh, apprehended
him this afternoon.

41:22.000 --> 41:25.739
I'm not asking how,
Agent DiNozzo, I'm asking who.

41:25.782 --> 41:29.521
His name is Ray Cruz.

41:29.565 --> 41:32.782
And he will never, ever
hurt anyone again.

41:36.565 --> 41:38.782
Thank you for-for all you done.

41:38.826 --> 41:41.608
Guess you Navy cops
aren't so bad.

41:41.652 --> 41:42.652
Gee, thanks.

41:44.304 --> 41:45.304
Walk you out?

41:45.347 --> 41:46.869
Yeah, yeah, sure.

41:49.826 --> 41:51.782
So, how long
you two been together?

41:51.826 --> 41:52.826
[Ziva and Tony chuckle]

41:52.869 --> 41:54.173
Oh, no,
we're not a couple.

41:54.217 --> 41:55.347
Just coworkers.

41:55.391 --> 41:56.739
And friends.

41:56.782 --> 41:57.608
Yes, yes.

41:57.652 --> 41:59.695
Very good friends.

41:59.739 --> 42:01.652
That's good.
That's, uh, real good.

42:01.695 --> 42:03.217
You hang onto that.

42:03.260 --> 42:06.000
You never know when you're gonna
need somebody to be there.

42:08.434 --> 42:09.695
Cherish each other.

42:09.739 --> 42:11.695
That's all I'm saying.

42:11.739 --> 42:13.739
Every day.
