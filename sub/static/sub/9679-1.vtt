01:05.220 --> 01:07.017
What have you got there, Matthew?

01:07.189 --> 01:09.020
I got speed, Joseph. I got speed.

01:09.191 --> 01:10.624
Speed, huh?

01:10.792 --> 01:13.852
Afraid we don't have much use
for more speed these days.

01:14.029 --> 01:16.293
Things are moving fast enough down there
as it is.

01:16.465 --> 01:17.523
Well, but the...

01:17.866 --> 01:21.393
- Get it.
- Damn. Oh, I shouldn't have said...

01:21.570 --> 01:25.097
I got it. Oh, fast little bugger.
I didn't mean to say "bugger" either.

01:25.273 --> 01:28.606
- Well, put it on the shelf.
- Could we just toss it down and see if...?

01:28.777 --> 01:31.712
- Speed is gonna have to wait.
- Could I just put it right there?

01:33.381 --> 01:34.643
Wow.

01:34.816 --> 01:36.306
What have you got there, Pedro?

01:36.485 --> 01:38.612
Uh, it's a voice.

01:42.290 --> 01:43.382
That's a big voice.

01:43.558 --> 01:46.755
- Oh, yeah.
- Very big voice.

01:46.928 --> 01:48.759
And soft and sweet as any aria...

01:48.930 --> 01:51.490
...but strong and powerful
as anything before.

01:51.666 --> 01:53.759
Can we send that one down?
Send it right down.

01:53.935 --> 01:57.166
- Easy, easy. Matthew.
- I'm sorry. He's listening.

01:57.339 --> 01:59.239
That voice is an incredible gift.

02:01.176 --> 02:03.576
And with a great gift
comes great responsibilities.

02:05.380 --> 02:06.938
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:07.115 --> 02:08.946
What?

02:09.116 --> 02:11.142
There are rules that must be followed.

02:11.319 --> 02:12.684
Oh, the rules, the rules.

02:13.321 --> 02:16.654
- Yeah.
- Rules, rules. Um, um...

02:19.894 --> 02:21.088
Never lie.

02:23.664 --> 02:24.961
Always be fair.

02:25.599 --> 02:27.089
Never break a promise.

02:27.268 --> 02:28.963
Yeah.

02:29.737 --> 02:31.671
Those are tough.

02:31.839 --> 02:33.170
Well, wanna drop one?

02:33.340 --> 02:40.007
Ugh, to those who much is given,
much is expected from them.

02:40.681 --> 02:41.807
Him.

02:45.986 --> 02:47.214
Well, it's time.

02:48.589 --> 02:50.284
Let her rip.

03:44.178 --> 03:51.175
<i>Dream big, reach high</i>

03:51.619 --> 03:53.712
<i>Don't ever be afraid</i>

03:54.989 --> 03:58.390
<i>Just spread your wings and fly</i>

03:58.559 --> 04:02.359
<i>With a heart full of faith
A whole lot of luck</i>

04:02.529 --> 04:05.657
<i>And some love to see you through</i>

04:05.833 --> 04:12.705
<i>Dream big and it just might come true</i>

04:28.789 --> 04:32.782
<i>Dream big, reach high</i>

04:32.960 --> 04:36.623
<i>Don't ever be afraid
Just spread your wings and fly</i>

04:36.797 --> 04:40.699
<i>With a heart full of faith, a whole lot
of luck And some love to see you through</i>

04:40.868 --> 04:44.769
<i>Dream big and it just might come true</i>

04:44.937 --> 04:49.033
<i>Dream big, reach high</i>

04:49.208 --> 04:52.769
<i>Don't ever be afraid
Just fly, fly, fly</i>

04:53.246 --> 04:56.943
<i>With a heart full of faith, a whole lot
of luck And love to see you through</i>

04:57.116 --> 05:00.279
<i>Dream big and it just might come true</i>

05:03.189 --> 05:05.180
<i>Dream big</i>

05:07.226 --> 05:08.853
<i>Reach high</i>

05:09.395 --> 05:13.456
<i>Dream big, reach high</i>

05:13.633 --> 05:17.296
<i>Don't ever be afraid
Just spread your wings and fly</i>

05:17.470 --> 05:21.338
<i>With a heart full of faith, a whole lot
of luck And love to see you through</i>

05:21.507 --> 05:26.535
<i>Dream big and it just might come</i>

05:26.713 --> 05:33.175
<i>True</i>

05:36.022 --> 05:37.683
Hallelujah. Yeah.

05:59.712 --> 06:02.772
- Something wrong?
- No.

06:03.149 --> 06:06.346
Billy Connelly is a big fat idiot.

06:07.220 --> 06:10.155
Bobbie, be fair, never lie...

06:10.323 --> 06:12.655
...never break a promise.
- Never break a promise.

06:12.825 --> 06:14.884
But he said I was too poor
to have a mommy...

06:15.061 --> 06:16.722
...that my daddy didn't want me.

06:17.096 --> 06:18.495
Oh.

06:23.236 --> 06:24.863
Honey...

06:25.405 --> 06:28.272
...I told you, your mommy's in heaven.

06:28.708 --> 06:30.505
But what about my daddy? Where is he?

06:30.676 --> 06:32.405
Well...

06:32.578 --> 06:36.537
...you're old enough to know now,
so I'll tell you the whole story.

06:38.484 --> 06:41.078
Your daddy was a rodeo cowboy.

06:42.121 --> 06:46.717
He rode into town on a big, white horse.

06:46.893 --> 06:50.920
He had a smile that could make
the sun come out...

06:51.097 --> 06:53.725
...and eyes that could calm a wild mare.

06:54.567 --> 06:57.730
He met your mother
and there were fireworks.

06:58.571 --> 07:03.201
They had a beautiful,
wonderful love affair.

07:04.811 --> 07:06.244
And then the rodeo moved on.

07:06.612 --> 07:09.740
So he climbed back up
on his big, white horse...

07:09.916 --> 07:11.906
...and he rode out of town.

07:12.083 --> 07:16.144
And that's it.
Your daddy was a rodeo cowboy.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.184
Wow. A rodeo cowboy.

07:23.295 --> 07:26.492
<i>You left me for her</i>

07:27.833 --> 07:31.394
<i>She left you for him</i>

07:31.570 --> 07:36.405
<i>Now you're back again, begging</i>

07:36.575 --> 07:43.572
<i>Saying it was a moment of weakness
Couldn't help falling</i>

07:43.815 --> 07:47.979
<i>But now your love for me is rock solid</i>

07:48.553 --> 07:53.354
<i>If your love was a rock
I'd throw it through the window</i>

07:53.525 --> 07:57.791
<i>Skip it 'cross the water
Watch it sink to the bottom</i>

07:57.963 --> 08:02.024
<i>I'd crush it with a hammer
Then glue it back together</i>

08:02.200 --> 08:07.866
<i>Just to roll it down the mountain
Hope it never stops</i>

08:08.039 --> 08:11.031
<i>If your love was a rock</i>

08:11.209 --> 08:12.938
<i>You know it's true</i>

08:13.512 --> 08:18.882
<i>That's what I'd do</i>

08:20.652 --> 08:22.620
Thank you all very much.

08:22.787 --> 08:24.618
Now get ready for some hard riding...

08:24.789 --> 08:29.852
...as we welcome you to
the 25th annual Cloverton Rodeo.

08:38.003 --> 08:42.496
<i>Give a big round
of applause to Bobbie Thomas and her band.</i>

08:47.646 --> 08:48.704
You all right?

08:50.081 --> 08:52.208
- Yeah.
- Heh.

08:58.256 --> 08:59.314
Thanks.

09:00.492 --> 09:02.016
I really enjoyed your singing.

09:04.029 --> 09:05.724
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

09:05.897 --> 09:08.923
<i>... welcome to the annual
Cloverton Rodeo and Stampede.</i>

09:15.273 --> 09:16.501
Thanks.

09:20.679 --> 09:23.307
Bobbie, I am so very sorry.

09:23.481 --> 09:27.144
I'm not sure what happened.
Listen, I'm just glad you ain't hurt. Heh.

09:27.319 --> 09:29.378
You ain't hurt, are you?

09:29.554 --> 09:30.953
Bobbie?

09:31.122 --> 09:33.955
Hey, you all right?

09:34.125 --> 09:36.183
Honey, did you hit your head?

09:36.927 --> 09:39.225
Do you like my singing, Wes?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.426
Of course. Yeah, yeah, I love it.

09:41.599 --> 09:45.035
I think you sing as good as the people
that sing in the Grand Ole Opry.

09:45.202 --> 09:46.726
Uh, better.

09:46.904 --> 09:50.237
<i>Let's give
a warm welcome to the Cloverton flag girls.</i>

09:50.407 --> 09:54.400
About tonight,
you should wear something special.

09:54.578 --> 09:56.739
Special? For what?

09:56.914 --> 10:01.214
Well, because it's gonna be
a real special night for us.

10:09.193 --> 10:11.718
Oh, my God.

10:12.396 --> 10:13.488
Ella?

10:14.498 --> 10:16.432
- Ella.
- What are you screaming about, child?

10:19.603 --> 10:22.265
At least I stay home when I look like this.

10:22.439 --> 10:24.339
What happened to you?

10:26.644 --> 10:28.703
Ella, I have a problem.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.746
Yes, you do, child. Come here.

10:35.719 --> 10:39.018
- What do you think of Wes?
- That he's a nice boy.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.252
Do you think I should marry him?

10:42.960 --> 10:45.485
- Did he ask you?
- No.

10:46.130 --> 10:48.189
But I think he's going to.

10:48.365 --> 10:49.957
- Tonight.
- Do you love him?

10:51.335 --> 10:52.359
I don't know.

10:52.536 --> 10:54.663
He's the best catch in this little town.

10:54.838 --> 10:56.169
Except for...

10:57.474 --> 11:01.638
- Do you believe in love at first sight?
- I believe in everything.

11:02.112 --> 11:04.876
But how do you know
when you're in love?

11:05.149 --> 11:08.482
- What's it feel like?
- Oh, that's easy.

11:09.286 --> 11:11.254
When you're in love...

11:11.422 --> 11:15.119
...it's like the sun rises and sets
on that person's smile.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.793
They can make you fly higher
than you've ever soared...

11:18.962 --> 11:21.897
...and sink lower than you've ever sunk.

11:22.232 --> 11:25.531
You feel like you don't know
what you're doing half the time...

11:25.703 --> 11:28.297
...but you know exactly what's going on
the other half.

11:28.739 --> 11:31.367
It's the most beautiful feeling
in the world.

11:31.542 --> 11:34.875
It's like taking a bath
in warm tapioca pudding.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.704
Yeah.

11:38.582 --> 11:39.674
Yeah.

11:42.352 --> 11:44.616
Have you ever been in love?

11:45.189 --> 11:47.521
Nope. Never took a bath
in pudding either.

11:47.691 --> 11:49.659
Now go take a shower.

11:49.827 --> 11:51.852
Gee, thanks.

12:13.883 --> 12:15.612
- Hello, Weston.
- Hello, Ella.

12:15.785 --> 12:17.514
Uh, ma'am.

12:19.122 --> 12:20.487
Huh.

12:21.591 --> 12:24.924
- Don't you look fine tonight.
- Oh, well, thanks. Heh, heh.

12:25.094 --> 12:26.288
Do I?

12:26.462 --> 12:28.953
Well, come on inside.
Bobbie's almost ready.

12:29.132 --> 12:30.793
Okay. Thank you.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.094
- Thank you.
- Um...

12:33.903 --> 12:35.632
You're welcome.

12:35.805 --> 12:38.171
Well, just have a seat here.

12:38.474 --> 12:39.998
She'll be down in just a bit.

12:40.176 --> 12:43.077
- Can I get you anything to drink?
- Nope. No, thank you.

12:48.751 --> 12:49.911
How about a napkin?

12:50.787 --> 12:51.845
I'm sorry?

12:52.088 --> 12:55.956
Uh, oh, oh. No, thank you.
I'm just a little excited tonight.

12:57.360 --> 13:02.229
Not excited, you know, but anxious.

13:02.398 --> 13:03.831
Anxious.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.895
- I'll get you that napkin.
- Okay.

13:07.570 --> 13:09.470
Poor child.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.118
Okay, I'm ready.

13:24.287 --> 13:25.481
Hey. Heh, heh.

13:25.655 --> 13:28.920
- You all right?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

13:29.091 --> 13:32.117
- Wow. You look great.
- Thank you.

13:32.295 --> 13:34.160
Yeah, sure.

13:34.764 --> 13:36.595
- Here's your napkin.
- Napkin? For what?

13:36.766 --> 13:38.825
Uh, nothing, ha. You ready?

13:39.001 --> 13:40.025
- Yeah.
- Okay.

13:40.203 --> 13:43.172
Thanks, Ella. Ma'am.

13:44.674 --> 13:46.403
Close your eyes.

13:47.143 --> 13:48.235
Step down.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.346
- Why are your hands all wet?
- Shh, shh. Just a little bit further.

13:51.514 --> 13:53.175
- You sure you can't see?
- I'm sure.

13:53.349 --> 13:56.375
Okay, step down.
Just keep going. There you go.

13:56.552 --> 13:57.849
This needs to be perfect.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.853
- Where are we going?
- Shh, shh. Just a couple more steps.

14:01.023 --> 14:02.854
There you go. One more.

14:03.025 --> 14:05.152
Okay, here we go. All right. Now face me.

14:05.328 --> 14:07.592
- Don't peek, okay?
- I'm not peeking.

14:07.763 --> 14:11.597
Okay, you can open your eyes now.

14:13.336 --> 14:14.735
Isn't she perfect?

14:16.339 --> 14:18.102
- A pickup truck?
- Yeah.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.139
No. Not just a pickup truck.

14:20.309 --> 14:24.507
I mean, it's a automatic, four-wheel drive.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.443
It's perfect.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.583
- That's what this is about?
- Oh, yeah.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.878
- Our special night?
- Yes. Yeah. Yeah, why?

14:32.053 --> 14:36.513
What did you think? Ha.
I mean, look at it, it's gorgeous.

14:36.691 --> 14:40.286
Yeah, she's beautiful. Oh, man.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.987
Yeah, l... Wait, wait. Bobbie?

14:43.164 --> 14:45.064
- Where are you going?
- A pickup truck.

14:45.233 --> 14:48.862
That's what was so important.
He bought himself a pickup truck.

14:49.037 --> 14:50.971
I'm out of here.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.807
- Bobbie?
- Tell him to go away.

15:03.785 --> 15:07.414
I can't believe this. What an idiot I am.

15:08.423 --> 15:09.447
A pickup truck.

15:12.093 --> 15:14.396
I can't believe I lasted
as long as I did in

15:14.409 --> 15:16.723
this dumpy, little,
nothing-happening, old town.

15:21.036 --> 15:23.402
- Going somewhere?
- Yes.

15:23.571 --> 15:25.334
I'm going to Nashville, Tennessee...

15:25.507 --> 15:28.135
...and I'm gonna be a huge
country music star.

15:28.310 --> 15:29.868
I been singing my whole life...

15:30.879 --> 15:33.279
...time to see if I'm any good at it.

15:33.815 --> 15:36.750
Because I've had it
with this stupid little town...

15:36.918 --> 15:39.079
...and all these stupid little people in it.

15:39.254 --> 15:41.381
Except for you, of course.

15:42.624 --> 15:44.592
Of course.

15:48.196 --> 15:49.322
How will you live?

15:50.899 --> 15:54.391
I have saved $237.50.

15:55.103 --> 15:57.901
Bus fare is only 87 bucks.

15:58.506 --> 16:00.804
I'll get a job when I get there.

16:01.476 --> 16:03.706
Waiting tables or something.

16:04.346 --> 16:06.371
Done it my whole life.

16:07.082 --> 16:08.106
I'll be fine.

16:13.254 --> 16:15.586
I just feel like
I'm meant for something else.

16:16.224 --> 16:17.452
Something bigger.

16:17.625 --> 16:21.220
And it's not here in this little town...

16:21.696 --> 16:23.960
...working at the diner...

16:24.966 --> 16:29.096
...playing rodeo gigs on the back
of some stupid, old hay wagon.

16:31.172 --> 16:33.299
Ella, do you think
people will like my singing?

16:34.075 --> 16:35.099
I do.

16:39.647 --> 16:41.706
I'll miss you.

16:42.317 --> 16:44.615
I'll miss you too, baby.

16:45.120 --> 16:49.056
Now, just because you're going to
a big city, don't you forget the rules.

16:49.224 --> 16:52.284
- Never lie.
- Always be fair.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.393
And never break a promise.

16:56.897 --> 16:58.660
I love you.

17:01.201 --> 17:02.691
Here.

17:04.471 --> 17:06.200
I have something for you.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.040
- It's beautiful.
- Open it.

17:14.948 --> 17:16.848
It belonged to your mother.

17:19.219 --> 17:21.016
What's this?

17:21.922 --> 17:24.823
That is a reminder.

17:25.792 --> 17:30.696
No matter what happens,
however tough life may get out there...

17:30.864 --> 17:34.527
...remember, you can always come home.

17:35.502 --> 17:37.299
Thank you.

17:58.025 --> 17:59.515
<i>Bye.</i>

18:09.870 --> 18:10.000
Here we go.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.599
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Here we go.

18:11.599 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

19:54.674 --> 19:58.075
Hey, hey, hey, that's all right.

19:58.244 --> 20:00.508
Hey. Hey, what's your name?

20:00.680 --> 20:03.410
Hey, come on, talk to me.

20:04.917 --> 20:07.010
Oh, man.

20:07.954 --> 20:09.717
Jesus.

21:31.937 --> 21:36.101
<i>Don't ever be afraid</i>

21:36.275 --> 21:40.234
<i>Spread your wings and fly</i>

21:40.713 --> 21:44.649
<i>With a heart full of faith
A whole lot of luck</i>

21:44.817 --> 21:48.946
<i>And some love to see you through</i>

21:49.788 --> 21:52.586
<i>Dream big</i>

21:53.658 --> 21:58.186
<i>It just might come...</i>

22:10.508 --> 22:12.305
Good morning.

22:13.712 --> 22:14.770
Good morning.

22:14.946 --> 22:16.880
Oh, God.

22:17.982 --> 22:20.951
No, just one of his many workers.

22:21.119 --> 22:23.519
I'm sorry. I just needed a place to sleep.

22:23.688 --> 22:25.679
I'll leave right now.

22:25.990 --> 22:30.450
- You new in town?
- Uh, yeah. I just got here last night.

22:30.628 --> 22:34.462
I haven't found a place to stay yet
but I'm sure I'll find one today.

22:34.632 --> 22:36.395
It's just different than I thought.

22:36.568 --> 22:39.833
You, um, gonna drag those around
with you all day?

22:40.672 --> 22:43.835
I have to. I don't have anywhere else
to put them.

22:44.008 --> 22:46.568
If you like, I'll keep your bags here.

22:46.745 --> 22:49.771
You can come get them
when you find a place to stay.

22:49.948 --> 22:52.143
That would be a big help. Thank you.

23:17.542 --> 23:20.511
- Here you go.
- Hey, great.

23:20.678 --> 23:22.669
Let's see here.

23:23.148 --> 23:25.446
I actually just got to Nashville yesterday.

23:25.950 --> 23:30.216
I started with my Aunt Ella at Jake's Diner
just about the day I started walking.

23:30.522 --> 23:32.581
That's right around the corner
from my house.

23:32.757 --> 23:35.351
When I got out of school,
I started working full-time...

23:35.527 --> 23:38.018
...but I had learned
the whole restaurant business...

23:38.196 --> 23:42.656
...by the time I was 8 years old anyway,
so it wasn't that exciting for me.

23:42.834 --> 23:45.098
But that's not
what I wanted to do with life...

23:45.270 --> 23:48.831
...so I thought I'd come to Nashville
and I try my luck as...

23:49.007 --> 23:50.235
A singer?

23:51.009 --> 23:54.604
- Yeah. How'd you know?
- Just a hunch.

23:58.616 --> 24:00.743
I don't have an address
or a phone number...

24:00.919 --> 24:02.819
...because I just got here, you know?

24:02.987 --> 24:04.614
Yeah, um...

24:04.956 --> 24:08.119
Why don't you give us a call back,
like, when you get a phone.

24:08.293 --> 24:09.783
Should I come back tomorrow?

24:10.962 --> 24:12.053
We'll see what happens.

24:13.230 --> 24:14.492
Oh.

24:15.098 --> 24:16.622
Okay.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.290
Thank you.

24:44.127 --> 24:46.425
Can I get you anything else, hon?

24:49.666 --> 24:52.226
Just some more water, please.

24:54.538 --> 24:57.632
- You new in town?
- Mm-hm.

24:58.375 --> 25:00.775
- You a singer?
- Yeah.

25:00.944 --> 25:02.172
Me too.

25:02.346 --> 25:06.043
Only don't tell the manager. He only wants
professional waitresses working here.

25:06.216 --> 25:07.945
You get a lot of bigwigs in here.

25:08.118 --> 25:10.985
He doesn't want people bothering them
and giving them music...

25:11.154 --> 25:13.588
...and stuff like that. You know.

25:14.625 --> 25:18.254
Uh-huh.
How long you been working here?

25:18.595 --> 25:20.085
A while.

25:20.264 --> 25:22.960
But as soon as I get my record deal,
I'm gone.

26:04.908 --> 26:06.398
- Hi!
- Hi!

26:06.577 --> 26:07.635
Hey.

26:07.811 --> 26:09.176
Hey.

26:10.647 --> 26:12.205
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

26:12.382 --> 26:16.079
I saw the sign outside, "waitress wanted,"
and I'd like to apply.

26:16.253 --> 26:19.882
You're a very beautiful girl.
Wonderful and pretty.

26:20.290 --> 26:21.780
Well, thank you very much.

26:23.827 --> 26:25.294
Does that mean I get the job?

26:25.462 --> 26:28.226
Ha-ha-ha. Good sense of humor.

26:29.466 --> 26:30.899
No.

26:31.201 --> 26:33.465
First, ask questions.

26:33.637 --> 26:36.629
- Name?
- Bobbie Thomas.

26:38.107 --> 26:39.938
Good grip.

26:40.109 --> 26:42.703
My name Morita, owner Sushi House.

26:42.878 --> 26:46.336
- Nice to meet you, Morita.
- Pleasure mine.

26:46.515 --> 26:49.382
- You have experience?
- Yes.

26:49.552 --> 26:52.385
Twelve years at Jake's Diner
in Cloverton, Kentucky...

26:52.555 --> 26:54.682
...where I been working
since I was this high.

26:54.857 --> 26:58.657
- Because it was right around the corner...
- Plenty, plenty. Good, good, good.

26:59.962 --> 27:02.157
Very pretty.

27:02.331 --> 27:05.061
- Look like movie star.
- Thank you.

27:05.601 --> 27:07.262
So...

27:07.703 --> 27:09.068
...are you a singer?

27:13.676 --> 27:14.938
Nope.

27:17.046 --> 27:20.413
Oh, no. She lied.

27:21.484 --> 27:23.315
What's all this about?

27:24.186 --> 27:26.518
- She lied.
- Yeah, I know. I heard.

27:26.689 --> 27:28.088
That's one.

27:28.257 --> 27:30.691
It's so sad when they lie.

27:32.294 --> 27:36.492
Oh, now don't cry.
You'll cause a flood down there.

27:36.666 --> 27:39.191
He takes it so personally.

27:53.482 --> 27:56.417
Okay, you get job.

27:56.585 --> 28:00.282
But I run business here.

28:00.456 --> 28:04.017
Need people to work at business,
not music.

28:04.193 --> 28:07.162
Must be serious about sushi.

28:07.463 --> 28:08.725
Can you start now?

28:10.266 --> 28:12.860
- Sure.
- Congratulations.

28:13.035 --> 28:14.935
Thank you.

28:21.777 --> 28:24.405
Where all that rain come from?

28:32.955 --> 28:34.752
<i>- Raw fish?
- Hai.</i>

28:34.924 --> 28:36.482
<i>- People eat this?
- Hai.</i>

28:36.659 --> 28:37.990
Sushi very good.

28:39.095 --> 28:41.359
Hey, how long you been singer?

28:41.831 --> 28:43.765
Well, my whole... Uh...

28:43.933 --> 28:46.993
Hey, they're waiting for sushi.

28:47.169 --> 28:48.966
Excuse me.

28:49.138 --> 28:52.198
Raw fish and hot wine.

28:53.275 --> 28:55.266
Everything okay, Mr. Haskins?

28:55.444 --> 28:57.844
Morita, if it were any better,
I wouldn't able to stand it.

28:59.515 --> 29:02.279
- Say, who's the new acquisition?
- Her name Bobbie.

29:02.818 --> 29:05.877
- First night tonight.
- She's a beautiful young lady.

29:06.054 --> 29:09.285
<i>Hai. And very good worker.</i>

29:21.402 --> 29:23.393
- Thank you.
- No problem.

29:23.571 --> 29:27.667
Bobbie, very good job tonight.

29:27.842 --> 29:30.276
- You good worker.
- Thank you.

29:30.445 --> 29:31.673
<i>- Jimi.
- Hai.</i>

29:31.846 --> 29:34.576
Please, make some sushi
for our new worker.

29:34.749 --> 29:36.910
<i>- Hai.
- Oh, no, no.</i>

29:37.085 --> 29:38.643
You don't have to do that.

29:43.324 --> 29:45.315
In Japan...

29:46.394 --> 29:50.626
...you no accept gift, must kill you.

29:52.267 --> 29:54.963
Morita make joke.

29:56.638 --> 30:00.233
You should know what sushi taste like
if you sell.

30:02.510 --> 30:04.478
<i>Hai. Good night.</i>

30:04.946 --> 30:06.470
Good night.

30:24.599 --> 30:26.362
Don't we have a hamburger
or something?

30:26.534 --> 30:27.831
What?

30:28.002 --> 30:31.563
No, it's a sushi house. We make sushi.

30:31.739 --> 30:34.264
Try it. It's cool.

30:35.043 --> 30:39.571
- What happened to your accent?
- Oh, that's our sushi accent.

30:48.489 --> 30:51.117
It's okay, just use your hands.

31:06.808 --> 31:08.332
Not bad.

31:11.679 --> 31:14.978
- Here's a song.
- A song?

31:15.216 --> 31:17.707
You're a singer, right?

31:17.886 --> 31:20.650
Uh, well...

31:48.982 --> 31:51.177
- You're a band?
- We, are:

31:51.351 --> 31:53.285
The Rising Sons.

31:55.389 --> 31:58.881
I thought Morita only wanted
professional restaurant people.

31:59.059 --> 32:00.287
No musicians?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.189
Well, that's gonna be a bit tricky...

32:02.362 --> 32:05.661
...considering everyone in Nashville's
a musician.

32:06.199 --> 32:08.394
- You ready?
- Ready for what?

32:08.568 --> 32:09.865
- To sing.
- Sing?

32:10.037 --> 32:13.564
Here we go, fellas.
One, two, three, four.

32:15.776 --> 32:18.006
<i>The country smells like</i>

32:18.178 --> 32:20.544
<i>Flowers in the spring</i>

32:20.714 --> 32:24.707
<i>The city smells like urine
Oh, but here's the thing</i>

32:24.885 --> 32:28.184
<i>Sometimes I'm hard to understand</i>

32:28.355 --> 32:30.380
<i>That's hard to take</i>

32:30.557 --> 32:36.757
<i>But if you'd simply take my hand
You'd love me anyway</i>

32:37.264 --> 32:48.107
<i>You can love me anyway</i>

32:49.743 --> 32:53.509
Ha-ha-ha.
That's great. You guys are wonderful.

32:53.880 --> 32:58.408
- Wow.
- Miss Bobbie, you sing like an angel.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.019
- Thank you.
- So what do you think of my song?

33:02.689 --> 33:04.816
- You wrote it.
- Yep.

33:07.894 --> 33:10.021
Well, the music is great.

33:10.197 --> 33:13.098
Yes. See, guys. I told you.

33:13.266 --> 33:15.461
But the lyrics could use some work.

33:15.635 --> 33:18.035
That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I'm talking about.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.766
It's okay, man.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.852
<i>The country smells like</i>

33:37.024 --> 33:39.993
<i>Flowers in the spring</i>

34:03.249 --> 34:06.309
<i>If I'm...</i>

34:06.752 --> 34:11.382
<i>If I'm just a girl</i>

34:11.556 --> 34:13.320
<i>Would you love me?</i>

34:13.492 --> 34:18.429
<i>Just one against the world</i>

34:18.597 --> 34:19.962
<i>Would you love me?</i>

34:20.132 --> 34:25.195
<i>If I can't be like everybody else</i>

34:25.371 --> 34:28.101
<i>So I walk away from a dream</i>

34:28.274 --> 34:32.438
<i>I never even wanted for myself</i>

34:32.610 --> 34:37.878
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

34:41.920 --> 34:46.415
<i>If I'm not strong enough</i>

34:46.592 --> 34:48.617
<i>Would you love me?</i>

34:48.793 --> 34:53.424
<i>And if I need you too much</i>

34:53.599 --> 34:55.157
<i>Would you love me?</i>

34:55.333 --> 35:00.465
<i>If I run to you when I wanna cry</i>

35:00.639 --> 35:02.436
<i>When I'm gonna break</i>

35:02.608 --> 35:07.568
<i>And you can't understand why</i>

35:07.746 --> 35:12.706
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

35:14.720 --> 35:21.091
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

35:21.260 --> 35:28.063
<i>Baby, I need to hear you say</i>

35:28.234 --> 35:31.795
<i>That you know me, you really know me</i>

35:31.971 --> 35:38.968
<i>And you love me anyway</i>

35:50.256 --> 35:54.522
<i>If I want to fly</i>

35:55.060 --> 35:57.187
<i>Would you love me?</i>

35:57.363 --> 36:01.493
<i>And hold me while I try</i>

36:01.667 --> 36:03.532
<i>Because you love me?</i>

36:03.702 --> 36:08.662
<i>If I wish to live among the stars</i>

36:08.841 --> 36:12.004
<i>Where I can touch God's face</i>

36:12.178 --> 36:15.978
<i>Would you let me go that far</i>

36:16.148 --> 36:22.552
<i>And love me anyway?</i>

36:22.720 --> 36:28.352
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

36:29.694 --> 36:36.122
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

36:36.734 --> 36:40.067
<i>Baby, I need to hear you say</i>

36:40.238 --> 36:53.584
<i>That you love me anyway</i>

36:54.085 --> 36:56.246
<i>Ooh</i>

36:57.288 --> 36:58.550
That's beautiful.

37:06.097 --> 37:09.430
<i>Hai, very beautiful song.</i>

37:10.000 --> 37:10.335
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:10.335 --> 37:13.930
Jimi, pour some sake for everyone.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:13.930 --> 37:16.975

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:49.407 --> 37:53.275
I would like to propose a toast...

37:53.745 --> 37:58.205
...to Bobbie Thomas
and the Rising Sons.

37:58.383 --> 38:02.752
- How'd you know about the Rising Sons?
- It is my job to know everything.

38:03.454 --> 38:07.288
That is why
I will become manager of the band.

38:08.526 --> 38:12.656
You will all become very famous...

38:12.830 --> 38:16.027
...and I will drive a Cadillac.

38:22.507 --> 38:29.504
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

38:30.381 --> 38:32.372
Solo the vocals for me.

38:33.718 --> 38:38.781
<i>That you love me anyway</i>

38:38.956 --> 38:41.424
Put this on tape for me, Lester.

38:46.596 --> 38:49.121
Janie, how you doing, darling?
It's Keith Haskins.

38:49.299 --> 38:51.767
Yeah. Is the grouch around?

38:53.804 --> 38:56.272
Hey, Charlie, how you doing,
old buddy?

38:56.640 --> 39:00.804
Yeah, well, I only called you because you're
close and I won't have to get in my car.

39:01.411 --> 39:05.370
Now, I've got something you need
to do yourself a favor and listen to.

39:06.083 --> 39:08.517
No, no, no, not tomorrow.

39:08.685 --> 39:10.653
Tomorrow it'll be on the radio.

39:10.821 --> 39:12.516
Now, this company is hot right now.

39:12.689 --> 39:14.452
It would be a great place
for you guys to be.

39:14.624 --> 39:15.716
Yeah!

39:15.892 --> 39:19.726
Now, I've known the old man
for a long time, so he trusts me.

39:19.896 --> 39:23.457
Now, let me do all the talking
when we're in there, all right?

39:23.633 --> 39:27.262
Man, I hate this alley.
Always smells like urine.

39:28.004 --> 39:31.201
My lyrics, exactly. See, guys. I told you.

39:31.375 --> 39:33.935
Your lyrics stink worse than the alley.

39:34.111 --> 39:36.011
- You got it right, dude.
- Not true.

39:36.179 --> 39:39.171
I write very powerful lyrics.

39:54.364 --> 39:55.661
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

39:55.832 --> 39:57.527
I want you to meet Bobbie Thomas.

39:58.268 --> 40:00.600
Oh, the little girl with the big voice.

40:01.071 --> 40:03.699
Welcome to
the Bobcat Entertainment Company.

40:03.874 --> 40:07.207
Keith, we'll finally see
what kind of manager you are.

40:07.978 --> 40:10.879
Hey, good of you to come.
Gotta run. Thank you.

40:11.214 --> 40:12.511
What just happened in there?

40:12.949 --> 40:16.578
What just happened in there
is I just got you your first record deal.

40:18.155 --> 40:21.591
The train is pulling out and you are on it.

40:22.392 --> 40:25.361
Let's celebrate, you all.
Morita, Sushi House?

40:25.762 --> 40:29.596
<i>Hai. Drinks on the house.</i>

40:29.766 --> 40:31.927
Guys, guys, guys,
I need to talk to Bobbie...

40:32.102 --> 40:34.297
- ...so, uh, we'll meet you there later.
- Cool, man.

40:48.652 --> 40:51.780
Let's go, kid. This train is rolling.

40:55.225 --> 40:59.389
When you're ready
for some T-shirts, hats...

40:59.563 --> 41:02.794
...Good Old Boy Merchandise.
That's the place you go.

41:02.966 --> 41:05.560
- We'll call you.
- Keith's a very good guy, by the way.

41:05.735 --> 41:08.101
He'll make you a really good manager.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.974
I thought Mr. Morita was our manager.

41:14.677 --> 41:16.975
Bobbie, Mr. Morita is
a good restaurant manager...

41:17.146 --> 41:18.408
...not a manager of talent.

41:18.581 --> 41:20.242
This is a whole different world.

41:20.416 --> 41:22.907
But he brought us to you,
made the whole thing happen.

41:23.652 --> 41:25.517
He gave me a job
when I really needed it.

41:27.423 --> 41:29.186
It isn't fair.

41:29.358 --> 41:32.350
Now, don't you worry about Morita.
He's being well taken care of.

41:39.635 --> 41:41.398
All right, great. We'll see you then.

41:41.570 --> 41:43.435
- Hey, Keith.
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?

41:43.606 --> 41:44.698
Great.

41:44.874 --> 41:47.138
I'd introduce you
but I don't remember his name.

41:47.309 --> 41:49.277
Can't be that important, huh?

41:49.445 --> 41:51.640
- Does that cell call long distance?
- Absolutely.

41:51.814 --> 41:53.179
- You wanna call?
- Could I?

41:53.349 --> 41:54.509
Sure. Dial away.

42:02.424 --> 42:04.085
- Hello?
- Aunt Ella, it's me.

42:04.260 --> 42:05.557
<i>I know it's you, child.</i>

42:05.728 --> 42:08.322
No one else would call me at this hour.

42:08.497 --> 42:09.896
It's good to hear your voice.

42:10.065 --> 42:12.192
It's good to hear you too.

42:12.368 --> 42:14.802
Sometimes I get so homesick,
I can hardly stand it.

42:14.970 --> 42:16.460
You can always come home.

42:16.639 --> 42:19.267
I know, but I'm doing pretty good now.

42:19.441 --> 42:22.968
I got a job serving sushi and I met
some guys at work who have a band.

42:23.145 --> 42:25.079
<i>We wrote a song together
about my daddy...</i>

42:25.247 --> 42:27.374
...then Mr. Morita,
who owns the Sushi House...

42:27.550 --> 42:30.883
...and knows everyone in the business,
introduced us to Mr. Haskins...

42:31.053 --> 42:34.853
...who's, like, a really important manager,
and he introduced us to Mr. Bunch...

42:35.024 --> 42:38.551
...who signed us to a recording contract
at Bobcat Entertainment...

42:38.727 --> 42:40.354
...and we're gonna cut a record.

42:40.529 --> 42:43.054
<i>- What do you think?
- I think you need to take a breath.</i>

42:43.232 --> 42:45.860
Heh, I guess I'm just a little excited.

42:47.570 --> 42:49.731
- Your phone's beeping.
- Oh, it's another call.

42:49.905 --> 42:52.373
- Call waiting.
- I gotta go. He's got another call.

42:52.708 --> 42:55.541
- I love you, Ella.
- I love you too, darling.

42:55.711 --> 42:59.704
- Remember, be fair, and...
- Never break a promise, I know.

42:59.882 --> 43:01.713
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

43:03.352 --> 43:04.944
Hello?

43:05.120 --> 43:07.748
Ha-ha-ha. How you doing, buddy? All right.

43:07.923 --> 43:09.390
I'm good, I'm good.

43:09.558 --> 43:11.048
What about "never tell a lie"?

43:11.493 --> 43:12.926
What?

43:14.363 --> 43:17.924
Well, yeah. Yeah, I've been waiting.

43:27.843 --> 43:30.038
- Leon, how you doing, buddy?
- Good. How are you?

43:30.212 --> 43:32.305
Bobbie, say hi to Leon.
He's your new lawyer.

43:32.481 --> 43:34.142
- Bobbie, Leon. How are you?
- Hi.

43:34.316 --> 43:36.580
- Good to meet you.
- I never had a lawyer before.

43:36.752 --> 43:37.878
Boy, you got one now.

43:38.053 --> 43:42.614
Why don't you two step into the vocal booth
where you can hear yourselves think?

43:56.904 --> 43:58.565
Hey, Charlie.

43:58.740 --> 44:01.971
- You get her John Henry on the contract?
- Leon's doing it right now.

44:02.143 --> 44:05.112
- How's the band?
- Amateur night in Dixie.

44:05.613 --> 44:08.673
Sorry looking bunch. Get rid of them.
They're not the right image.

44:08.850 --> 44:10.909
She's not gonna like it.

44:11.586 --> 44:14.020
This little girl is gonna be
the home run hitter...

44:14.188 --> 44:17.021
...if we don't screw it up.
Get her a hot band.

44:19.727 --> 44:26.291
Pam, send Tony down
with 2,000 in 20s. For Keith.

44:29.037 --> 44:32.632
All right, you're the hotshot manager.

44:32.807 --> 44:34.798
You make her happy.

44:43.685 --> 44:45.516
I can't wait till you're on the road.

44:45.687 --> 44:47.882
It's a pleasure.

44:48.056 --> 44:51.082
- Glad to represent you.
- Thank you.

44:55.897 --> 45:00.391
- How you're doing, darling?
- Great. I think.

45:01.836 --> 45:03.929
Things seem to be happening so fast.

45:06.240 --> 45:10.370
Bobbie, this is your very first lesson
in becoming a star.

45:11.379 --> 45:13.370
Making difficult decisions.

45:13.548 --> 45:15.846
And you gotta make one right now.

45:17.685 --> 45:19.152
There's a problem with the band.

45:19.787 --> 45:21.687
What kind of problem? I'll talk to them.

45:21.856 --> 45:24.381
Unfortunately, that won't help.

45:24.792 --> 45:28.694
Truth is, they're just not very good.
We're gonna have to replace them.

45:33.968 --> 45:35.936
But they can get better.

45:36.104 --> 45:38.538
They'll work. I know these guys.
They'll work.

45:38.706 --> 45:41.368
Darling, I would love to be able
to dunk a basketball...

45:41.542 --> 45:44.375
...but no matter how hard I work,
it ain't ever gonna happen.

45:44.545 --> 45:47.207
But it's not fair.
I wouldn't be here without them.

45:47.381 --> 45:50.009
Kid, I'm sorry.
That's the way it's gotta be.

45:50.184 --> 45:52.652
You are the real talent here.

45:52.820 --> 45:54.913
This isn't charity work.
This is the big time.

45:55.089 --> 45:58.149
I know, but maybe we can...

45:58.326 --> 46:00.920
- Hey, is this a bad time?
- No, not at all. Come on in.

46:01.095 --> 46:02.585
Bobbie, Tony, your accountant.

46:02.764 --> 46:05.789
- Hi.
- Brought you a small advance.

46:06.366 --> 46:07.771
What's this?

46:07.784 --> 46:09.199
That is just a tiny
advance on the money...

46:09.369 --> 46:13.465
...this company knows you're gonna make.
- Shut the front door.

46:14.374 --> 46:16.171
Sign here.

46:18.678 --> 46:22.910
- Thanks. Nice to meet you, Bobbie.
- Nice to meet you, too.

46:27.788 --> 46:30.621
- It isn't fair.
- This is business.

46:30.791 --> 46:33.157
It isn't about being fair.

46:34.127 --> 46:35.151
Are you in?

46:41.101 --> 46:42.830
Yeah, I'm in.

46:44.337 --> 46:48.137
- Uh-oh. That's two.
- Yes, that's two.

46:48.308 --> 46:50.333
Just one left.

46:53.513 --> 46:56.539
Why are we walking? We can fly.

47:09.062 --> 47:13.897
<i>Would you love me anyway?</i>

47:14.067 --> 47:20.768
<i>Baby, I need to hear you say</i>

47:20.941 --> 47:22.806
<i>That you know me</i>

47:22.976 --> 47:31.941
You really know me
And you love me anyway

48:07.554 --> 48:09.818
Why does it need to be a real cowboy?

48:09.990 --> 48:15.485
Because a real cowboy walks, talks,
feels real.

48:15.662 --> 48:18.790
Some model is not gonna be real.

48:18.965 --> 48:20.557
That's ridiculous.

48:20.734 --> 48:25.194
This whole world is an illusion.
Nothing I do is real.

48:25.805 --> 48:26.931
She is.

48:27.507 --> 48:30.066
She's absolutely the real deal.

48:34.213 --> 48:36.204
Hey, what about this one?

48:39.018 --> 48:40.815
Let's see.

48:42.154 --> 48:45.317
- He's handsome enough.
- I like him.

48:45.491 --> 48:47.482
- He looks like the real thing.
- Who is he?

48:47.660 --> 48:51.152
Just some cowboy,
rides the rodeo circuit.

48:51.330 --> 48:53.525
A rodeo cowboy.

48:53.699 --> 48:55.360
Perfect.

49:10.582 --> 49:12.880
Dale, someone's on the phone for you.

49:13.052 --> 49:16.715
- Is it the bank?
- Nope. Some production company.

49:16.989 --> 49:19.514
- Production company?
- Mm-hm.

49:19.692 --> 49:22.786
- What do they want?
- Why don't you talk to them and find out?

49:22.962 --> 49:26.921
- Why don't you not sass me, booper?
- I have to. I'm your sister. It's my job.

49:27.099 --> 49:29.397
- Sure it ain't the bank?
- I'm sure.

49:29.568 --> 49:31.297
- You think it's the bank, Rog?
- Yes.

49:32.638 --> 49:34.196
- Go answer the phone.
- Okay.

49:35.607 --> 49:38.542
I need me a good bull this weekend.

49:51.924 --> 49:53.448
Hello?

49:56.161 --> 49:58.561
Yeah, this is he.

50:02.267 --> 50:03.859
A video?

50:04.403 --> 50:07.429
Yeah. And what would I have to do?

50:12.778 --> 50:14.712
Ride a horse, wear a hat and smile.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.348
Hell, I can do that.

50:17.683 --> 50:19.981
But how much does it pay?

50:20.786 --> 50:23.118
One thousand dollars?

50:23.856 --> 50:26.450
Two thousand dollars?

50:27.393 --> 50:29.554
You gotta be kidding me.

50:30.195 --> 50:33.892
Three thousand dollars?
Shut the front door.

50:40.072 --> 50:42.438
You know who you're talking to?

50:42.608 --> 50:46.738
This is Dale Jordan, the bull rider.

50:55.926 --> 50:57.587
Okay.

50:58.362 --> 50:59.954
Yes, sir.

51:00.464 --> 51:02.762
You got yourself a deal.

51:08.105 --> 51:10.972
You're a hell of a good
negotiator too, sir.

51:11.742 --> 51:13.073
Yes.

51:13.811 --> 51:15.711
See you Monday.

51:29.660 --> 51:34.290
Five thousand dollars.

51:54.585 --> 51:55.574
Excuse me, sir.

51:58.355 --> 52:01.518
I'm Dale Jordan.
Think I'm supposed to be in this deal.

52:01.692 --> 52:04.786
Oh, yeah, the cowboy.
They were just looking for you.

52:04.962 --> 52:08.830
You're in dressing room number two.
Park right next to the dressing room.

52:08.999 --> 52:11.490
Then I think they wanna see you
in the makeup trailer.

52:11.669 --> 52:13.694
Makeup trailer?

52:14.038 --> 52:15.335
Here we go.

52:15.506 --> 52:17.167
What is that stuff you're stirring?

52:17.341 --> 52:20.230
This, my darling, is a
special elixir that is

52:20.243 --> 52:23.143
going to have you
sparkling like a diamond.

52:23.314 --> 52:27.648
It is my very own personal discovery
of brilliant vitamins and minerals...

52:27.818 --> 52:30.309
...that when applied
to your facial epidermis...

52:30.488 --> 52:35.721
...will make your skin come alive and
dance like angels in front of the camera.

52:35.893 --> 52:39.192
- You're gonna put that on my face?
- No, no, no.

52:39.363 --> 52:42.161
I'm going to paint it, like Picasso.

52:42.333 --> 52:44.062
Now close your eyes.

52:44.235 --> 52:46.032
Come on. Close your eyes.

52:46.203 --> 52:48.831
First, I'm going to take care...

52:49.006 --> 52:51.566
...of this little mustache that's growing
that we're going to...

52:53.577 --> 52:55.636
Mr. Jordan.

52:58.349 --> 53:01.682
Hi. They're ready for you over in Makeup.

53:13.697 --> 53:17.861
I'm just gonna let this set that
right there.

53:19.603 --> 53:20.934
Wait, wait, wait.

53:21.105 --> 53:23.470
Uh, um...

53:23.640 --> 53:27.508
They sent me here for, uh, like, makeup
or something.

53:27.677 --> 53:30.373
- Oh, oh. The cowboy. Yes, of course.
- Yeah.

53:30.547 --> 53:32.777
All right. Come in, please. Sit down.

53:32.949 --> 53:35.884
- I'll be right with you, all right?
- Okay.

53:38.922 --> 53:41.755
Um, excuse me, one second.

53:41.925 --> 53:45.088
- Hello, are you all right?
- No. I look like an alien pig.

53:45.261 --> 53:46.694
And he saw me.

53:46.863 --> 53:49.991
Oh, come on. Don't be so vain.
You have to come out so I can finish.

53:50.166 --> 53:52.225
I'm not coming out there while he's here.

53:55.238 --> 53:56.728
You know what?

53:56.906 --> 53:59.898
I think we can do you right now.

54:01.211 --> 54:05.307
Hey, I don't want you to put
that white stuff on my face.

54:05.481 --> 54:07.608
Oh, oh. Heaven's no.

54:07.784 --> 54:14.246
With you it's just a matter of a puff there
and a little puff over here.

54:14.624 --> 54:16.182
All right?

54:16.960 --> 54:19.986
I saw that smile.
You can smile, you know.

54:20.163 --> 54:22.893
It's just different for me, okay?

54:23.066 --> 54:27.230
Have a little brush-brush here
and a brush-brush there.

54:29.672 --> 54:33.199
Okay, here we are, here we are.
Just let me take one look.

54:36.379 --> 54:38.540
You're all done. Okay?

54:38.715 --> 54:40.342
Thank you.

54:44.988 --> 54:46.819
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

54:46.990 --> 54:49.686
- Is he gone?
- Yes, Miss Vain, he's gone.

54:49.859 --> 54:53.590
You can safely emerge
from your place of hiding.

55:01.905 --> 55:03.839
What's wrong with my face?

55:04.007 --> 55:05.770
What's wrong with your face?

55:05.942 --> 55:08.069
Nothing's wrong.
You have a beautiful face.

55:08.244 --> 55:11.941
Then why'd you put all this gunk
on my face? You didn't put any on him.

55:12.382 --> 55:18.014
Because, my dear, you are the star.

55:29.799 --> 55:36.432
<i>We can't trust what we can't see</i>

55:36.606 --> 55:42.738
<i>We're not strong enough to fight
When we feel weak</i>

55:42.912 --> 55:49.373
<i>We can't resist another flame</i>

55:49.551 --> 55:55.319
<i>We're not able to live above the blame</i>

55:55.857 --> 56:02.387
<i>But love is</i>

56:02.564 --> 56:08.503
<i>Love is</i>

56:08.670 --> 56:11.605
<i>It's always been</i>

56:11.773 --> 56:15.106
<i>It always will be</i>

56:16.345 --> 56:21.248
<i>We may not be perfect</i>

56:21.416 --> 56:25.352
<i>But love is</i>

56:27.389 --> 56:32.554
<i>We may not be written</i>

56:32.728 --> 56:35.720
<i>Anywhere close to the stars</i>

56:35.897 --> 56:38.127
<i>But wherever we are</i>

56:38.300 --> 56:44.796
<i>Love is</i>

56:50.779 --> 56:53.748
<i>It's always been</i>

56:53.915 --> 56:57.282
<i>It always will be</i>

56:58.420 --> 57:03.255
<i>Love may not be perfect</i>

57:04.426 --> 57:09.921
<i>Oh, we may not be perfect</i>

57:10.000 --> 57:10.098
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:10.098 --> 57:16.936
<i>But love is</i>
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.936 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:23.011 --> 57:29.507
<i>Love is</i>

57:31.153 --> 57:32.848
<i>Ooh</i>

57:55.043 --> 57:58.012
Thank you for helping me with my video.

57:59.181 --> 58:01.149
Well, it was interesting.

58:02.951 --> 58:07.445
I hope all this works out for you.
I really enjoyed your singing.

58:08.023 --> 58:09.547
You said that last time.

58:10.692 --> 58:12.660
What?

58:12.828 --> 58:14.294
Do you remember me?

58:14.462 --> 58:18.091
You know, maybe if you put some mud
on your face it might help.

58:18.265 --> 58:20.893
- You do remember.
- Of course I do.

58:22.236 --> 58:24.431
You made quite the first impression.

58:24.605 --> 58:25.833
So did you.

58:30.344 --> 58:33.142
You've sure come a long way
since falling off that wagon.

58:34.115 --> 58:37.573
I have my first real concert this Saturday
at the Municipal Auditorium.

58:37.785 --> 58:42.245
Wow, huh? Jeez. Big time, huh?

58:42.423 --> 58:44.983
I've never played anywhere so big.
I'm a little nervous.

58:45.426 --> 58:47.189
You'll do great.

58:49.063 --> 58:52.328
If you'd like to come,
I could get you tickets.

58:53.400 --> 58:58.394
Uh, I'd love to
but I got this rodeo in Beaumont.

59:00.975 --> 59:03.409
But if the old bull throws me off
in the afternoon...

59:03.577 --> 59:06.705
...and I don't make the finals...

59:07.448 --> 59:09.541
...I might be able to make it
to your concert.

59:09.717 --> 59:10.741
Great.

59:10.918 --> 59:13.716
I'll leave you tickets and backstage passes
at will-call.

59:13.888 --> 59:17.517
All right. Okay.

59:23.864 --> 59:26.355
If I don't make it to your concert...

59:28.135 --> 59:31.036
...good luck with it all.
- Thank you.

59:35.876 --> 59:39.107
- You ain't gonna wish me luck?
- Nope.

59:40.481 --> 59:41.743
I'm rooting for the bull.

59:41.916 --> 59:43.349
Ha, ha.

59:45.286 --> 59:47.015
See you.

01:00:14.014 --> 01:00:15.311
Thank you. Enjoy the show.

01:00:21.355 --> 01:00:23.983
- Any good news, Bubba?
- Not much.

01:00:24.158 --> 01:00:26.422
- Spurs won.
- Yes.

01:00:26.594 --> 01:00:27.652
Must have been the Lakers.

01:00:34.935 --> 01:00:36.664
Hi.

01:00:43.876 --> 01:00:45.503
- Oh my gosh. Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:48.309
Just stopped by,
wanted to wish you luck tonight.

01:00:48.481 --> 01:00:50.005
Thank you. I'm gonna need it.

01:00:50.183 --> 01:00:52.947
No, you won't. Just do what you do.

01:00:53.119 --> 01:00:55.144
You'll be fine. You'll be great.

01:00:56.389 --> 01:00:59.688
I can't believe you're standing here
in person, talking to me.

01:00:59.859 --> 01:01:02.259
I am still standing.

01:01:02.428 --> 01:01:04.419
- Anyway, good luck.
- Thank you.

01:01:04.597 --> 01:01:06.155
All right, bye.

01:01:06.733 --> 01:01:08.462
Come on, Bubba.

01:01:11.104 --> 01:01:13.971
Good luck following that act, boss.

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:21.769
- Knock them dead, kid.
- I'll try.

01:01:22.682 --> 01:01:25.310
- Have you seen Dale?
- Who, the cowboy?

01:01:25.485 --> 01:01:26.884
No. Is he supposed to be here?

01:01:29.188 --> 01:01:31.884
Never count on a bull.

01:01:32.058 --> 01:01:37.724
<i>Here she is,
country's newest star, Bobbie Thomas.</i>

01:01:42.835 --> 01:01:45.360
<i>Hey, hey</i>

01:01:53.212 --> 01:01:57.342
<i>Black leather boots
Deep-sea green eyes</i>

01:01:58.184 --> 01:02:02.621
<i>A miracle in blue jeans
Cut her out to size</i>

01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:07.283
<i>What did I do?
How did I find?</i>

01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:11.055
<i>How did such a good love thing
Walk into my life?</i>

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:14.927
<i>Oh, that's my man</i>

01:02:16.235 --> 01:02:21.468
<i>He loves everything I am</i>

01:02:21.641 --> 01:02:25.737
<i>That's my man</i>

01:02:25.912 --> 01:02:28.881
<i>Honeysuckle kisses so delicious</i>

01:02:29.048 --> 01:02:32.575
<i>Honey, that's my man</i>

01:02:40.193 --> 01:02:44.892
<i>I can't get no sleep
But that's all right</i>

01:02:45.064 --> 01:02:49.364
<i>The magic in his fingers
Filling up my nights</i>

01:02:49.802 --> 01:02:54.535
<i>I get a little bit weak
When he holds me tight</i>

01:02:54.707 --> 01:02:58.165
<i>Taking me to heaven
He's my magic carpet ride</i>

01:02:58.344 --> 01:03:03.043
<i>Oh, that's my man</i>

01:03:03.216 --> 01:03:08.084
<i>He loves everything I am</i>

01:03:08.253 --> 01:03:13.247
<i>That's my man</i>

01:03:13.425 --> 01:03:15.916
<i>Honeysuckle kisses so delicious</i>

01:03:16.094 --> 01:03:20.463
<i>Honey, that's my man</i>

01:03:24.536 --> 01:03:28.199
<i>Sweet as honey
That's my man</i>

01:03:31.543 --> 01:03:33.636
<i>Oh, oh</i>

01:03:45.490 --> 01:03:46.821
<i>A little later in the show...</i>

01:03:46.992 --> 01:03:49.085
<i>... we'll meet country music sensation,
Bobbie Thomas.</i>

01:03:49.261 --> 01:03:52.253
<i>And we'll hear the touching story
behind her number one record...</i>

01:03:52.431 --> 01:03:54.991
<i>... and we'll have a couple of surprises
for her as well.</i>

01:03:55.167 --> 01:03:57.567
<i>So stay tuned, we'll be right back.</i>

01:03:58.303 --> 01:03:59.895
<i>Kymaro's New Body Shaper...</i>

01:04:00.071 --> 01:04:02.869
<i>... is so light that you can
wear it year round.</i>

01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:08.343
<i>It can be worn with the clingiest of fabrics
and is great for casual and formal wear.</i>

01:04:08.513 --> 01:04:10.811
<i>Call right now and get
Kymaro's New Body Shaper...</i>

01:04:10.982 --> 01:04:13.951
<i>... for the incredible low price
of only 39.95.</i>

01:04:14.119 --> 01:04:18.180
<i>Yes, for a limited time,
it's yours for only 39.95.</i>

01:04:18.356 --> 01:04:20.586
<i>And listen to this. If you call right now...</i>

01:04:22.761 --> 01:04:25.229
Looks like one of them
touchy shows, huh?

01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:27.322
What are you doing here?

01:04:27.499 --> 01:04:31.492
I'm not really sure, to be honest.
I mean, I got this phone call...

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.900
...and they said that you'd be here.

01:04:34.573 --> 01:04:36.803
And it seems wherever you are,
there's free food.

01:04:40.178 --> 01:04:43.545
- It's nice to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.

01:04:43.715 --> 01:04:47.173
Miss Thomas, you're on after
the next commercial. You ready?

01:04:47.352 --> 01:04:48.876
I guess so.

01:04:49.054 --> 01:04:50.453
Knock them dead, kid.

01:04:54.259 --> 01:04:57.126
- Wish me luck.
- No.

01:04:57.295 --> 01:04:59.456
- I'm betting on the bull.
- Ha.

01:04:59.898 --> 01:05:01.832
Right this way.

01:05:09.774 --> 01:05:14.404
<i>Well, music critics all across the country
are calling my next guest...</i>

01:05:14.779 --> 01:05:16.508
...the country girl with the gift.

01:05:16.681 --> 01:05:19.650
Please welcome
the new star of country music...

01:05:19.818 --> 01:05:21.945
...Bobbie Thomas.

01:05:36.567 --> 01:05:37.659
Wow, what a welcome.

01:05:40.504 --> 01:05:43.667
- Thank you, Bobbie, for being on the show.
- Thank you for having me.

01:05:43.841 --> 01:05:48.403
Okay. So your first single goes to
number one on the Billboard music charts.

01:05:48.579 --> 01:05:52.879
Your first video has just gone
to number one on the country video charts.

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:56.611
You're currently the opening act for
the undisputed king of country music...

01:05:57.254 --> 01:05:59.984
...and the critics have dubbed you
the girl with the gift.

01:06:00.157 --> 01:06:02.591
How do you feel about
all this sudden success?

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.694
Well, I'm very thankful.

01:06:04.862 --> 01:06:07.296
Uh, it's fantastic. It's like a dream.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:10.627
Oh, this is no dream, I can assure you.

01:06:10.801 --> 01:06:14.703
So let me ask you about the lyrics
to your first number one hit...

01:06:14.872 --> 01:06:16.271
..."Would You Love Me Anyway?"

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:19.102
I understand these lyrics
are very personal to you.

01:06:19.276 --> 01:06:22.404
Yes. My mama died
while giving birth to me...

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.343
...so I was raised by my Aunt Ella.

01:06:24.515 --> 01:06:26.608
And I never really knew
much about my daddy...

01:06:26.784 --> 01:06:29.582
...other than the stories that Ella told me.

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:34.053
So the lyrics to this song are really
just the stories that she told me.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:37.091
- So you've never seen your father at all?
- No.

01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:41.095
When you were a little girl wondering
about your daddy late at night...

01:06:41.265 --> 01:06:44.359
...did you even have a picture
in your mind...

01:06:44.535 --> 01:06:45.900
...what he might look like?

01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:48.004
Well, I remember...

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:51.835
I used to close my eyes
as hard as I could...

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:56.036
...and I could picture him
on a big, white horse...

01:06:56.213 --> 01:06:58.477
...but I never could really see his face.

01:06:58.649 --> 01:07:01.914
Did you ever picture him looking like
that handsome young cowboy...

01:07:02.086 --> 01:07:03.553
...you used in your video?

01:07:04.922 --> 01:07:06.913
I don't know.

01:07:07.257 --> 01:07:10.988
We happen to have that handsome
young cowboy with us here with us today.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.359
Dale Jordan, ladies and gentlemen.

01:07:27.678 --> 01:07:30.044
Welcome to the show, Dale.

01:07:31.115 --> 01:07:33.913
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Oh, he's so polite.

01:07:35.119 --> 01:07:37.519
So I understand that you, yourself...

01:07:37.688 --> 01:07:40.657
...handpicked this handsome
young cowboy...

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:42.086
...to be in your video.

01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.886
Well, yes.

01:07:46.263 --> 01:07:48.356
- Dale, did you know that?
- No, ma'am.

01:07:48.866 --> 01:07:51.426
- Kind of flattering, huh?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:07:52.136 --> 01:07:54.730
The audience is eating this up.

01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:57.862
Wait till you see the next surprise.
It's a doozy.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.703
I'd have to say
that we have the greatest research team...

01:08:00.877 --> 01:08:03.471
...in all of television on this show...

01:08:03.646 --> 01:08:06.945
...because waiting for you backstage
is an incredible surprise.

01:08:08.451 --> 01:08:13.184
Brace yourself, because you're about
to meet the rodeo cowboy...

01:08:13.356 --> 01:08:14.380
...who is your daddy.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.627
Roy, come on out.

01:08:32.542 --> 01:08:36.706
Go ahead, Roy.
Give her that long-awaited hug.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:43.676
I'm Marilyn Montgomery
and we'll be right back.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:50.622
Brilliant. Did you hear the audience?
They loved it.

01:08:52.428 --> 01:08:55.693
- What's wrong with you?
- What are you talking about?

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:57.492
How could you do this to her?

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.261
I didn't do this. I had no idea
this was gonna happen.

01:09:00.435 --> 01:09:01.528
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:05.071
Hey, look, kid, these shows do these things
all the time.

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:08.210
I had nothing to do with it. Honest.

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:12.245
Hey, he's lying.

01:09:12.415 --> 01:09:14.474
He's lying?

01:09:19.956 --> 01:09:22.082
You're a jerk.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:29.996
I can't believe you fell down
and hit your face on a music stand.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.497
You're such a klutz.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:34.430
That's me, Mr. Klutz.

01:09:34.604 --> 01:09:37.505
Excuse me, can I get another one?

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.803
So, Daddy, you've just been riding
the rodeo circuit all these years?

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:45.814
Psst. Roy.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.950
- What?
- You've been riding the circuit...

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:52.917
...all these years?
- Oh, no. Not for a while.

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:57.019
- What have you been doing?
- Oh, you know, just living.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.251
This is great. I have my daddy.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.833
And thank you both
for coming to dinner with us.

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:06.992
It's the least I could do.

01:10:09.272 --> 01:10:10.933
Hey, can I get another one?

01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:12.506
Anybody want dessert?

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.939
No, I'm trying to stay in shape.

01:10:18.681 --> 01:10:20.706
I gotta hit the head.

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:22.680
Excuse me.

01:10:25.987 --> 01:10:29.923
You know, I'm gonna join him, actually.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.264
Thanks, I got one.

01:10:43.471 --> 01:10:46.304
You couldn't stay sober for long,
could you?

01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:49.609
Long enough to do that show.

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:54.504
You know, you're, uh,
not what she expected.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:56.981
Hell, I'm not what I expected.

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:59.643
So, what are you gonna do about it?

01:10:59.821 --> 01:11:01.755
I don't know.

01:11:01.923 --> 01:11:03.982
I didn't bargain for this.

01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:08.391
They just offered me a bunch of money.
Hell, I couldn't say no to it.

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:12.527
You're gonna break her heart.

01:11:13.368 --> 01:11:16.201
Seems like a nice kid.

01:11:17.005 --> 01:11:19.473
I don't wanna hurt her.

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:23.134
Then do the right thing.

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.871
Clean yourself up.

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:35.188
Thank you for inviting me to dinner.
Yeah, I really enjoyed it.

01:11:35.357 --> 01:11:37.291
So did I.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:46.299
- Good luck with your father.
- Thank you.

01:11:49.404 --> 01:11:53.204
- You sure did look beautiful tonight.
- Thank you.

01:11:56.378 --> 01:12:01.247
So much is happening to me right now.
It's so fast.

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:09.681
- I sure wish you could see the show again.
- Yeah.

01:12:10.926 --> 01:12:13.121
- Another rodeo.
- I know.

01:12:13.295 --> 01:12:15.058
Oh, hey.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:19.860
Now, I got you something
just to keep you company on the road.

01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:27.507
- It's not quite as mean as the ones I ride.
- I'm sure.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.610
Thank you.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.376
It kind of reminds me of you.

01:12:40.255 --> 01:12:43.156
- See you.
- Right.

01:13:11.385 --> 01:13:12.750
Smile.

01:13:20.427 --> 01:13:21.451
Daddy, you all right?

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:25.059
Daddy?

01:13:26.166 --> 01:13:30.102
I've been called about everything else,
but not daddy.

01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:31.965
You'll get used to it.

01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.937
No.

01:13:36.443 --> 01:13:38.638
- This isn't any good.
- What do you mean?

01:13:39.313 --> 01:13:41.804
This daddy, I'm not a daddy.

01:13:41.982 --> 01:13:44.007
Don't say that.

01:13:45.853 --> 01:13:49.846
Look, I'm not what you've been dreaming
about all these years.

01:13:50.024 --> 01:13:51.651
I'm not a rodeo cowboy.

01:13:54.094 --> 01:13:55.118
I'm a drunk.

01:13:55.729 --> 01:13:58.425
You asked me what I've been doing.
I've been drinking.

01:13:58.766 --> 01:14:03.066
I drink till I pass out,
I drink till I throw up on myself.

01:14:03.804 --> 01:14:06.204
I'm no good for you.

01:14:06.373 --> 01:14:09.274
Sooner or later, you're gonna get hurt.
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:14:10.978 --> 01:14:15.415
The best thing I could do is
go on down the road...

01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:17.311
...mind my own business.

01:14:17.818 --> 01:14:19.479
You're not going down any road.

01:14:21.588 --> 01:14:24.489
I've been waiting my whole life.
I'm not gonna let you just go.

01:14:24.958 --> 01:14:26.425
Well, you have to.

01:14:29.463 --> 01:14:31.624
I'm an alcoholic.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:35.834
- I'm sick.
- We'll get you in one of those programs.

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:38.638
I've been through those.
They don't work for me.

01:14:38.972 --> 01:14:40.940
But I'm here now.

01:14:41.108 --> 01:14:42.939
I'll help you. Whatever it takes.

01:14:45.145 --> 01:14:49.445
- We'll get through this together.
- Bobbie, I'm a bad drunk.

01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:54.285
A time's gonna come you'll wish to hell
you'd never found me.

01:14:57.357 --> 01:15:01.191
Never. I'll be there for you,
no matter what.

01:15:02.729 --> 01:15:04.720
I'll be there.

01:15:05.466 --> 01:15:06.558
I promise.

01:16:06.959 --> 01:16:11.055
- Mark, let's do another mic check.
- All right. On my way.

01:16:14.133 --> 01:16:17.364
- Hey, double-check those levels.
- Got it.

01:16:17.537 --> 01:16:18.936
Check for the house sound.

01:16:22.275 --> 01:16:26.143
- Are they gonna use this spot?
- Yes.

01:16:59.278 --> 01:17:04.477
Hey, check this out.
Come on, come on, watch me, watch me.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.900
How are you?
Me and my best friend right here.

01:17:31.077 --> 01:17:33.102
Come on, Roy, cool off.

01:17:46.224 --> 01:17:48.192
<i>Get the adrenaline pumping...</i>

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.353
<i>... and let's get ready for the bull riding
event of the evening.</i>

01:17:53.665 --> 01:17:56.429
Hey, Dale. Good luck, man.

01:17:58.737 --> 01:18:00.466
<i>Make some noise for this cowboy...</i>

01:18:00.639 --> 01:18:03.403
<i>... because that may be
the only paycheck he gets.</i>

01:18:03.575 --> 01:18:05.907
<i>He's a cowboy that needs to make
a paycheck, folks.</i>

01:18:06.378 --> 01:18:10.508
<i>He's finished number eight all around
and this year he's making a big comeback...</i>

01:18:10.682 --> 01:18:13.879
<i>... after some injuries
he took at Cheyenne last month.</i>

01:18:14.352 --> 01:18:16.820
<i>Cowboy Dale Jordan
was last year's winner...</i>

01:18:16.988 --> 01:18:19.957
<i>... but he's gonna need to score big
to hold the lead.</i>

01:18:20.125 --> 01:18:22.923
Get ready. Nice and easy.

01:18:23.094 --> 01:18:25.688
<i>This bull has been unridden this year.</i>

01:18:26.197 --> 01:18:29.928
<i>He's setting in the chute,
waiting for the nod.</i>

01:18:45.784 --> 01:18:48.514
<i>Oh, no. That doesn't look good folks.</i>

01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:51.679
<i>The bullfighters are out there
doing their work.</i>

01:18:53.291 --> 01:18:55.384
Oh, God.

01:18:58.229 --> 01:19:00.629
- Any good news, Bubba?
- Not much.

01:19:00.799 --> 01:19:04.064
- Spurs lost.
- Damn.

01:19:07.439 --> 01:19:08.872
All right.

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:16.113
- Bobbie, tell these rent-a-cops who I am.
- Miss, he keeps saying this is his show.

01:19:16.281 --> 01:19:19.944
- Get the hell out of here. I run this show.
- Stop it. Everyone. Everyone.

01:19:20.118 --> 01:19:21.517
- You shut up.
- Daddy, stop.

01:19:21.686 --> 01:19:23.210
I'll handle this. Shut up!

01:19:23.388 --> 01:19:25.788
- Your daddy?
- Yeah. Come on.

01:19:35.166 --> 01:19:38.624
- What are you doing?
- Get off me!

01:19:38.803 --> 01:19:42.398
I don't take nothing off nobody,
especially some little snot-nosed kid.

01:19:42.574 --> 01:19:45.737
- What is wrong with you?
- You watch your attitude, you little tramp.

01:19:46.378 --> 01:19:48.141
You're just like your mother.

01:19:48.313 --> 01:19:50.474
All your makeup and a little hussy.

01:19:50.949 --> 01:19:52.007
Get out.

01:19:52.183 --> 01:19:54.515
- Get out of here.
- Nobody tells me what to do.

01:19:54.686 --> 01:19:58.213
- Get out. I never wanna see you again.
- I am not leaving. I like it.

01:19:58.390 --> 01:20:01.587
- There's lots of action, free booze.
- No, you are not staying here.

01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:04.756
- Party time.
- I hate you.

01:20:04.929 --> 01:20:06.191
I wish I'd never found you.

01:20:07.765 --> 01:20:09.892
Oh, no. No, no, no.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:10.534
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:10.534 --> 01:20:12.024
- That's, um...
- Three.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:12.202
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:12.202 --> 01:20:14.466
...three. Yeah.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.466 --> 01:20:17.674
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:17.674 --> 01:20:18.936
Hey, what's the problem?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:18.936 --> 01:20:20.511
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:20.511 --> 01:20:22.000
You want some?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:22.411
You want some?

01:20:28.986 --> 01:20:31.978
Hey, Bubba, get his ass out of here.

01:20:32.456 --> 01:20:33.684
Come on, Roy.

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:37.687
You all right?

01:20:38.695 --> 01:20:39.719
I think so.

01:20:40.497 --> 01:20:42.124
Good, because you got a show to do.

01:20:42.299 --> 01:20:44.961
- You get yourself together.
- I know. I'll be ready.

01:20:45.135 --> 01:20:47.000
Okay. Then let's do it.

01:20:58.115 --> 01:21:03.280
Damn, I think I broke my hand,
that hardheaded SOB.

01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:07.717
We're ready for you, Miss Thomas.

01:22:46.556 --> 01:22:49.491
- Poor little guy.
- It's empty.

01:22:49.659 --> 01:22:52.890
It was a very big voice.
Perhaps too big for her.

01:22:53.062 --> 01:22:55.860
We'll have to put it back on the shelf.

01:23:01.871 --> 01:23:03.896
What was that?

01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:12.606
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Bobbie Thomas.</i>

01:23:57.293 --> 01:23:59.090
What the...?

01:24:12.475 --> 01:24:15.774
Bobbie, how long have
you been singing?

01:24:15.945 --> 01:24:18.743
My whole life. Why?

01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:21.947
What's wrong with me?

01:24:22.118 --> 01:24:25.849
Well, nothing. Ha.
That's what makes this so unusual.

01:24:26.022 --> 01:24:28.923
We've run every test imaginable,
over and over...

01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:31.525
...and they all say the same thing.

01:24:31.694 --> 01:24:35.494
With your larynx, you should never
have been able to sing at all.

01:24:35.665 --> 01:24:38.532
In simple terms, it's defective.

01:24:39.235 --> 01:24:41.863
- Congenital?
- Since birth.

01:24:42.038 --> 01:24:45.269
What are you saying, doc?
When will she be able to sing again?

01:24:45.441 --> 01:24:48.410
She'll probably never be able
to sing again.

01:24:50.112 --> 01:24:54.572
<i>That's what the voice clinic said, Charlie.
They ran every test possible.</i>

01:24:54.750 --> 01:24:58.117
They don't know how she sung in the
first place. They said it was a miracle.

01:24:58.420 --> 01:25:02.220
Well, maybe it was just a matter of time
before this happened.

01:25:04.292 --> 01:25:07.318
Well, we can't be held responsible
for that.

01:25:08.063 --> 01:25:10.759
The contracts?
Well, of course I have them.

01:25:12.701 --> 01:25:15.101
Of course I read them.

01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:17.261
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:25:17.439 --> 01:25:20.875
Come on, old buddy,
how long we been working together?

01:25:24.179 --> 01:25:27.148
Yeah, well so long to you too.

01:25:36.758 --> 01:25:38.487
Well, kid, I'm sorry.

01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.527
If you can't sing,
you're not worth anything in Nashville.

01:25:41.696 --> 01:25:43.163
- What do you mean?
- It's simple.

01:25:43.331 --> 01:25:46.095
You signed the contracts. It's over.

01:25:46.267 --> 01:25:48.497
- What's over?
- Everything's over.

01:25:48.670 --> 01:25:52.003
Your singing career, your record deal...

01:25:52.173 --> 01:25:54.334
...your rented houses, your money,
everything.

01:25:54.509 --> 01:25:56.374
But I've had a number one hit.

01:25:56.544 --> 01:26:00.241
We haven't even released a second single.
There's gotta be some money left.

01:26:01.349 --> 01:26:03.613
Who do you think's paying for all this?

01:26:03.785 --> 01:26:08.620
The cash advance, the studio time...

01:26:08.790 --> 01:26:11.884
...the studio musicians,
the professional band...

01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:14.585
...the producer, the music video...

01:26:14.763 --> 01:26:16.663
...the transportation...

01:26:16.831 --> 01:26:18.890
...Morita's Cadillac...

01:26:19.067 --> 01:26:22.662
...the cell phone bills, everything?
This is part of your deal.

01:26:24.672 --> 01:26:28.039
Right now, you owe the record company
a lot of money.

01:26:28.209 --> 01:26:30.643
And if you're lucky, lucky...

01:26:30.812 --> 01:26:34.748
...your album sales will offset
most of the costs and you won't get sued.

01:26:38.219 --> 01:26:40.050
Singing's what made you special, kid.

01:26:41.923 --> 01:26:44.517
If your voice is gone, so are you.

01:29:09.670 --> 01:29:12.434
I been waiting for you, child.

01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:27.243
I tried to call you a million times.
Why didn't you answer?

01:29:27.754 --> 01:29:30.985
- Are you okay?
- Oh, I'm fine.

01:29:31.425 --> 01:29:33.916
Didn't wanna talk on the phone.

01:29:36.363 --> 01:29:38.092
You look sick.

01:29:39.166 --> 01:29:40.656
You sound sick.

01:29:44.237 --> 01:29:46.603
I lost my voice.

01:29:46.773 --> 01:29:48.468
I know.

01:29:49.909 --> 01:29:53.276
It takes a strong person to carry
a gift that big.

01:29:54.613 --> 01:29:57.514
You have to be strong enough
to follow the rules.

01:29:57.850 --> 01:30:00.717
I don't know what to do if I can't sing.

01:30:00.886 --> 01:30:03.548
You can sing, child. Sing like a bird.

01:30:05.591 --> 01:30:08.253
You just have to learn to do it differently.

01:30:08.427 --> 01:30:09.724
You don't understand.

01:30:10.663 --> 01:30:13.791
I've lost my voice. It's gone.

01:30:14.967 --> 01:30:18.130
And the doctors say I'll never get it back.

01:30:18.304 --> 01:30:22.104
Then you'll have to learn to sing
with your heart.

01:30:27.213 --> 01:30:28.908
How do I do that?

01:30:29.081 --> 01:30:31.379
You search your heart.

01:30:32.651 --> 01:30:33.982
Search for what?

01:30:35.955 --> 01:30:38.685
For a way to make amends.

01:30:38.858 --> 01:30:42.055
For the wrongs that were done
and the people that were hurt.

01:30:44.764 --> 01:30:45.992
Right now...

01:30:46.866 --> 01:30:51.132
...your heart is empty, child.
I can feel it.

01:30:53.172 --> 01:30:56.801
When your heart once again is filled...

01:30:56.976 --> 01:30:59.604
...with love and joy...

01:31:00.312 --> 01:31:02.405
...you'll sing again.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:09.116
It might not sound the same
but you will sing.

01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:14.651
Sing like you never thought you could.

01:31:43.823 --> 01:31:45.848
Sure is nice to see you, again, Bobbie.

01:31:46.025 --> 01:31:48.186
It's nice to see you, too, Wes.

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.090
I appreciate you driving me all this way.

01:31:51.263 --> 01:31:53.993
Aw, what could be better than
a beautiful girl in my truck...

01:31:54.166 --> 01:31:57.658
...driving down the road
on a beautiful afternoon?

01:31:59.705 --> 01:32:02.435
It really is a nice truck.

01:32:28.266 --> 01:32:30.166
- Sure you don't mind waiting?
- No, no.

01:32:30.335 --> 01:32:34.101
Not when I got a CD player
like this baby's got. Ha, ha.

01:32:58.196 --> 01:33:00.221
Just gentle, like this.

01:33:02.066 --> 01:33:04.830
Hi, I'm Sis. This is Megan.

01:33:05.003 --> 01:33:07.528
Hi, I'm Bobbie.

01:33:07.972 --> 01:33:09.872
I was looking for Dale.

01:33:10.041 --> 01:33:11.838
I know who you are.

01:33:12.010 --> 01:33:15.912
Dale's my brother.
But he isn't here right now.

01:33:18.449 --> 01:33:20.883
Could you stay with Megan
while I go answer the phone?

01:33:21.052 --> 01:33:23.077
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:33:24.622 --> 01:33:26.487
How you doing, Megan?

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:29.525
- Do you like horses?
- Yes.

01:33:29.694 --> 01:33:30.922
They're soft.

01:33:31.563 --> 01:33:37.399
They say the softest spot
in the whole world is a horse's nose.

01:33:37.735 --> 01:33:40.499
- Do you wanna feel?
- Mm-hm.

01:33:42.173 --> 01:33:44.698
- You like that?
- Mm-hm.

01:34:21.246 --> 01:34:25.148
Wow. That's amazing.

01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:27.843
Most of the kids will relate to horses...

01:34:28.019 --> 01:34:30.920
...even if they don't pay any attention
to people.

01:34:31.089 --> 01:34:33.523
But we've had trouble with Megan.

01:34:34.993 --> 01:34:39.225
She hasn't responded till now.

01:34:40.798 --> 01:34:42.594
This is amazing.

01:34:42.766 --> 01:34:45.792
Well, this is Dale's thing.

01:34:46.236 --> 01:34:48.170
It's very special.

01:34:48.739 --> 01:34:51.435
That's why he rides all those damn bulls.

01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:55.271
It costs a lot of money
to keep a place like this going.

01:34:57.581 --> 01:35:02.041
I'm not sure what we're gonna do with
him all busted up in the hospital like that.

01:35:02.219 --> 01:35:03.311
Hospital?

01:35:11.962 --> 01:35:12.986
Watch it.

01:35:14.498 --> 01:35:16.295
Oh, sorry.

01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:23.970
Howdy.

01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:25.608
Is he okay?

01:35:25.776 --> 01:35:28.336
Old bull smacked him
pretty good this time.

01:35:28.512 --> 01:35:30.173
I keep telling him he should stop...

01:35:30.347 --> 01:35:35.182
...but he thinks he gotta keep on riding
till that barn's paid off.

01:35:35.352 --> 01:35:38.844
That's his whole deal in life, you know,
helping them kids.

01:35:39.022 --> 01:35:42.150
To look at him, you wouldn't know
he was one of them.

01:35:42.693 --> 01:35:44.752
- What?
- He was autistic like them kids...

01:35:44.928 --> 01:35:46.020
...he's helping now.

01:35:46.196 --> 01:35:47.561
- He was autistic?
- Yep.

01:35:47.731 --> 01:35:50.461
We didn't know
what you called it back then.

01:35:50.634 --> 01:35:52.033
We just thought he was slow.

01:35:52.369 --> 01:35:55.827
Never spoke a word
till he was 11 years old.

01:35:56.006 --> 01:35:59.908
I used to take him down to the barn
and let him sit on the horses.

01:36:00.844 --> 01:36:02.243
He seemed to like it.

01:36:02.979 --> 01:36:07.609
Hell, the first word he ever spoke
was "horsy," not "mama" or "dada."

01:36:07.784 --> 01:36:08.944
Can you beat that?

01:36:09.653 --> 01:36:13.111
One day a bee stung this old bay horse
right there on the butt...

01:36:13.290 --> 01:36:15.087
...while Dale was sitting on him.

01:36:15.258 --> 01:36:17.954
That old horse would have broke you
in two, but now Dale...

01:36:18.128 --> 01:36:19.459
...he hung on.

01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:22.564
That's the first time he ever smiled.

01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:28.433
- How long do they think he'll be like this?
- Like what?

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.064
Unconscious.

01:36:31.241 --> 01:36:33.402
Hell, he ain't unconscious,
he's just asleep.

01:36:33.744 --> 01:36:37.145
Dale, Dale, wake up, son.
You got company.

01:36:37.314 --> 01:36:39.111
What?

01:36:43.153 --> 01:36:44.415
Hi.

01:36:46.823 --> 01:36:48.757
You bet on the bull again, didn't you?

01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:57.305
Thank you.

01:39:59.581 --> 01:40:04.211
I think right now we need to thank
a very special young lady.

01:40:04.385 --> 01:40:07.684
The young lady
that put this whole thing together.

01:40:07.855 --> 01:40:11.313
Bobbie Thomas, come on up here
to the stage and take a bow.

01:40:26.641 --> 01:40:29.872
A very important person in my life
once told me...

01:40:30.044 --> 01:40:34.242
...when I lost my voice,
that I could sing from my heart.

01:40:34.415 --> 01:40:38.181
So if you will excuse the sound of my voice
and just listen to my heart...

01:40:38.353 --> 01:40:42.687
...I'd like to sing a very special song
for these very special kids today.

01:40:59.574 --> 01:41:02.805
<i>There comes a time in everybody's life</i>

01:41:02.977 --> 01:41:06.572
<i>When your destiny is born</i>

01:41:06.748 --> 01:41:09.911
<i>And there's no doubt
What you're all about</i>

01:41:10.084 --> 01:41:12.382
<i>Is there without a warning</i>

01:41:13.321 --> 01:41:17.018
<i>And when it comes
You gotta take it</i>

01:41:17.191 --> 01:41:20.957
<i>And believe you're gonna make it through</i>

01:41:21.129 --> 01:41:24.462
<i>There's not a challenge you can't face</i>

01:41:24.632 --> 01:41:28.295
<i>There's not a rainbow you can't chase</i>

01:41:28.469 --> 01:41:31.461
<i>Dream big</i>

01:41:31.639 --> 01:41:35.473
<i>Reach high</i>

01:41:35.643 --> 01:41:42.549
<i>Don't ever be afraid
Just spread your wings and fly</i>

01:41:42.717 --> 01:41:46.084
<i>With a heart full of faith
A whole lot of luck</i>

01:41:46.254 --> 01:41:49.553
<i>And some love to see you through</i>

01:41:49.724 --> 01:41:51.817
<i>Dream big</i>

01:41:51.993 --> 01:41:57.124
<i>And it just might come true</i>

01:42:08.175 --> 01:42:11.474
<i>Always know what the future holds</i>

01:42:11.645 --> 01:42:15.081
<i>Is in the hands of fate</i>

01:42:15.248 --> 01:42:18.649
<i>And don't forget
That when times gets tough</i>

01:42:18.819 --> 01:42:21.617
<i>The gift is worth the wait</i>

01:42:21.788 --> 01:42:25.554
<i>But when it finally comes together</i>

01:42:25.726 --> 01:42:29.321
<i>Your star will shine forever more</i>

01:42:29.496 --> 01:42:33.023
<i>And you'll give hope to all the rest</i>

01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.263
<i>Show them how to be the best</i>

01:42:38.438 --> 01:42:40.565
Matthew, Joseph. Come here, quick.

01:42:40.741 --> 01:42:42.606
- What's all the ruckus?
- Look.

01:42:49.416 --> 01:42:51.247
I've never seen this before.

01:42:51.418 --> 01:42:52.715
What do you think it means?

01:42:54.588 --> 01:42:55.612
It means...

01:42:57.324 --> 01:42:59.451
...the gift should be returned.

01:43:00.627 --> 01:43:02.527
She has redeemed herself...

01:43:02.696 --> 01:43:05.824
...found a way to sing without her voice.

01:43:08.869 --> 01:43:10.359
Well, it seems you're right.

01:43:12.239 --> 01:43:14.503
Well, go on.

01:43:33.393 --> 01:43:36.760
<i>Dream big</i>

01:43:37.164 --> 01:43:40.793

01:44:01.087 --> 01:44:08.084

01:44:14.935 --> 01:44:16.835
<i>Come on, come on</i>

01:44:17.003 --> 01:44:18.834

01:51:41.435 --> 01:51:43.165
---the end---
