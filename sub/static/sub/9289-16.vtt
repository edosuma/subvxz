00:13.787 --> 00:15.447
I need to speak with the president.

00:15.539 --> 00:19.121
They can't diffuse it.
We'll have to fly it out.

00:19.209 --> 00:21.248
Ground zero has to be a precise location.

00:21.336 --> 00:24.705
A pilot will have to go down with the plane.
It's a suicide mission.

00:24.798 --> 00:27.834
- Who ended up flying the plane?
- Jack Bauer.

00:27.926 --> 00:31.924
- Get Air Force One ready as soon as possible.
- Do you mind if I ask where you're going?

00:32.012 --> 00:33.211
Los Angeles.

00:33.306 --> 00:35.928
- Who's he?
- His name is Yusuf Auda.

00:36.017 --> 00:41.356
His government assigned him as a liaison.
They helped us get the hard drive from Ali.

00:41.440 --> 00:44.809
It's a recording of a conversation
that took place four months ago.

00:44.901 --> 00:48.566
- Conversation between who?
- Ali and high-ranking government officials.

00:48.655 --> 00:50.861
These countries not only
knew about the bomb,

00:50.949 --> 00:54.152
- but they bought it and supplied it to Ali?
- Yeah.

00:54.244 --> 00:57.161
- Kim?
- Daddy. What's that noise? Where are you?

00:57.247 --> 01:00.367
I'm in a plane. We found the bomb.

01:00.459 --> 01:04.373
We needed someone to fly it over the desert,
so when it exploded nobody would get killed.

01:04.462 --> 01:08.128
- That someone turned out to be me.
- No, Daddy.

01:08.216 --> 01:13.127
I love you more than anything
in the world. Goodbye.

01:13.221 --> 01:15.416
George, what the hell are you doing here?

01:15.616 --> 01:18.132
Brought something for
ya. It's a parachute.

01:18.226 --> 01:20.634
I already told you,
I'm taking this plane in.

01:20.729 --> 01:25.438
You still got a life, Jack.
What's left but going straight and level

01:25.525 --> 01:27.897
and taking it into a dive? Am I right?

01:27.986 --> 01:31.900
- You really think you can do this?
- Jack, I'm supposed to do this.

03:57.010 --> 03:59.086
Oh, Dad.

04:58.488 --> 05:00.564
Agent Bauer.

05:01.241 --> 05:05.488
- My orders are to take you back to CTU, sir.
- That's affirmative.

05:08.832 --> 05:14.870
Lieutenant, I need you to get ahold of Tony
Almeida over at CTU. Tell him that I made it.

05:14.963 --> 05:18.130
He needs to get ahold
of my daughter, tell her I'm alive.

05:18.216 --> 05:21.834
Radio transmissions are a no-go,
and cell sites are down for miles.

05:21.928 --> 05:27.089
- You'll have to wait till we get there.
- Copy.

05:30.979 --> 05:34.395
Would everyone gather around, please?
This will just take a minute.

05:36.651 --> 05:41.064
George Mason asked me in advance
to thank you all for your dedication.

05:41.156 --> 05:46.862
Thanks to his sacrifice and your hard work,
millions of lives were saved.

05:46.953 --> 05:49.705
And that's a result that we can be proud of.

05:49.790 --> 05:53.574
To say that this has been a long day
would be an understatement,

05:53.668 --> 05:57.713
and I know you're all tired,
but this isn't over yet.

05:57.798 --> 06:02.127
We still got a lot of work to do.
The Cyprus recording is our primary focus.

06:02.219 --> 06:07.593
And that's critical to any military response
that Washington's considering.

06:07.682 --> 06:10.090
So let's get back at it, huh?

06:12.938 --> 06:15.144
Mr Almeida?

06:17.067 --> 06:19.558
I'm supposed to update my office right now.

06:19.653 --> 06:25.905
But I've got nothing to report except that
I've been excluded from this investigation.

06:25.992 --> 06:29.860
Look, I'll tell you what I can when I can.

06:29.955 --> 06:33.904
My country permitted your operatives
to raid Ali's apartment

06:34.000 --> 06:37.452
on condition that I would be
involved in this investigation.

06:37.546 --> 06:39.752
I understand your frustration, Mr Auda.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.924
You can call your office
and tell them anything you like.

06:43.009 --> 06:44.297
But we've got work to do here.

06:44.391 --> 06:47.470
And you're simply not authorised
to be part of it.

06:54.479 --> 06:57.765
- He doesn't look too happy.
- Yeah. Are the audio guys ready?

06:57.858 --> 06:59.981
They're waiting for you. Where's Michelle?

07:00.068 --> 07:01.977
- Interrogating Ali.
- Why?

07:02.070 --> 07:05.688
To see if he can shed any light
on the recording. We have a meeting.

07:05.782 --> 07:08.759
The president's waiting for confirmation
on the recording's authenticity.

07:08.859 --> 07:09.827
You take care of it?

07:09.911 --> 07:12.746
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

07:31.725 --> 07:35.509
This tape was recovered
from the hard drive in your apartment.

07:35.604 --> 07:41.856
It's a record of a meeting you had with
these three men on April 5 in Cyprus.

07:41.943 --> 07:48.195
They're all high-ranking officials from
three Arab countries, one of them your own.

07:48.283 --> 07:54.820
The tape proves you conspired with these
men to detonate a nuclear bomb on US soil.

07:57.626 --> 08:00.199
Were there others present
who didn't speak?

08:05.509 --> 08:08.260
You'll tell the interrogators in Guantanamo,

08:08.345 --> 08:12.971
under much less comfortable
circumstances. I'll ask you one more time.

08:13.058 --> 08:17.437
Tell me what you want me to say,
I'll say it.

08:18.337 --> 08:19.677
I want the truth.

08:19.773 --> 08:24.269
What does the truth matter
when you have this... recording?

08:25.070 --> 08:31.025
- Explain what that means.
- I never spoke to any of these men.

08:33.035 --> 08:36.654
Are you denying
that the meeting took place?

08:36.748 --> 08:41.327
There was never a meeting.
I was not even in Cyprus in April.

08:42.129 --> 08:45.462
- Where were you?
- Berlin.

08:52.139 --> 08:55.175
They'll find out the truth in Guantanamo.

08:55.267 --> 09:00.261
Why would I lie about this,
when I told you the truth about the bomb?

09:03.567 --> 09:06.354
To protect your country.

09:10.157 --> 09:14.071
The bomb was a Second Wave
operation only.

09:16.121 --> 09:19.241
I have never met those men.

09:28.216 --> 09:32.510
Agent Gibson, your team has finished
the analysis of the Cyprus recording?

09:32.596 --> 09:36.973
- Yes, sir.
- Could you walk us through it, please?

09:37.058 --> 09:42.397
We began by obtaining voice samples
for Ali and the three government officials.

09:42.481 --> 09:47.558
We deconstructed sound waves
and isolated unique qualities.

09:47.652 --> 09:49.978
The voices on the Cyprus audio

09:50.071 --> 09:54.733
are in fact those of Syed Ali and
the three government ministers in question.

09:54.826 --> 10:00.165
The recording could have been created
by putting pieces of conversations together?

10:00.248 --> 10:03.534
Yes, but reconstruction
always leaves artefacts,

10:03.627 --> 10:08.704
mismatched acoustical signatures or altered
cadences. We found no such artefacts.

10:08.799 --> 10:13.128
Is there any chance that it could have been
doctored in a way we couldn't detect?

10:13.220 --> 10:15.592
Anything's theoretically possible.

10:15.680 --> 10:17.756
But I can say with absolute certainty

10:17.849 --> 10:20.767
that the finest experts,
using the best equipment,

10:20.852 --> 10:23.723
cannot find any evidence
that this recording

10:23.814 --> 10:28.107
is anything but a genuine and accurate
record of an actual conversation.

10:28.193 --> 10:31.396
A conversation in which these
four men sat in the same room

10:31.488 --> 10:34.904
and conspired to detonate
a nuclear bomb on US soil?

10:36.701 --> 10:38.777
Yes, sir.

10:45.085 --> 10:47.374
I just finished talking with Ali.

10:47.462 --> 10:51.412
He claims that he's never even spoken
to any of the men in the recording.

10:51.508 --> 10:54.295
He says it's a complete fabrication,

10:54.386 --> 10:58.336
and that he was in Berlin
on April 5, not Cyprus.

11:06.148 --> 11:10.810
- He could be telling the truth.
- He still thinks we killed one of his sons.

11:10.902 --> 11:15.066
He's trying to save his family by denying
that his country's behind the nuke.

11:15.157 --> 11:19.783
I agree he has a motive to lie, but if there's
any possibility he's telling the truth,

11:19.870 --> 11:23.321
- I think we need to investigate.
- But he's not.

11:23.415 --> 11:26.582
- I mean, it's obvious.
- It's not obvious to me.

11:26.668 --> 11:31.544
The evidence versus the word of an attempted
mass murderer? It's clear which wins.

11:31.631 --> 11:34.004
- Carrie.
- And, no offense, Michelle,

11:34.092 --> 11:36.844
but your experience
as an interrogator is limited.

11:36.928 --> 11:39.799
- That's enough.
- I sat three feet away from him,

11:39.890 --> 11:44.137
and I believe he is a broken man
without the strength or resolve to lie.

11:45.645 --> 11:51.435
I'll tell the president what Ali said when I
call him to pass on Agent Gibson's findings.

11:51.526 --> 11:56.437
Now, if we don't have anything else here,
I think we're finished, right? Thank you.

12:11.880 --> 12:16.838
CTU managed to detonate the bomb
within a few metres of the coordinates.

12:16.927 --> 12:21.470
I'm going over the field report now.
I'm not seeing any casualty estimates.

12:21.556 --> 12:26.467
We expect zero direct casualties,
or close to it.

12:30.774 --> 12:32.850
Hmm.

12:33.777 --> 12:36.813
I want to give Bauer's daughter
personal condolences.

12:36.905 --> 12:39.692
You won't have to, sir.

12:39.783 --> 12:43.863
Bauer wasn't on the plane
at the time the bomb was detonated.

12:43.954 --> 12:48.366
- Do we know how this happened?
- Another man ended up piloting the plane.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.996
We're still getting the details.

12:53.505 --> 12:57.040
Sir? We just got word from CTU.

12:57.134 --> 13:00.384
They finished their analysis
of the Cyprus audio.

13:00.470 --> 13:05.595
It's real. And we have proof that Syed Ali,
the man behind the bomb,

13:05.684 --> 13:08.850
was given support
from the three different countries.

13:08.937 --> 13:12.057
Here's the transcript of their analysis...

13:12.149 --> 13:14.272
including margins of error.

13:15.026 --> 13:17.897
Do we have any reason
to doubt the veracity of this?

13:17.988 --> 13:22.400
Ali is denying it,
but I suppose that's to be expected.

13:27.789 --> 13:32.535
- Are the Joint Chiefs ready?
- General Bowden has them on standby.

13:38.967 --> 13:43.296
Given the evidence,
we don't have the option of not responding.

13:45.307 --> 13:48.308
I don't see any way around this. Do you?

13:55.192 --> 13:59.403
I want to issue a statement
that there was a nuclear weapon,

13:59.488 --> 14:01.646
but there were no casualties.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.946
I will alert the networks, sir.

14:04.493 --> 14:07.031
And contact the Hill.

14:07.120 --> 14:12.197
Let them know I'll be calling
for an emergency session of Congress.

14:12.959 --> 14:18.167
During which, I'll be asking them
for a formal declaration of war.

14:41.412 --> 14:43.737
Chappelle wants to see your report.

14:43.831 --> 14:47.663
I'm ordering more data points.
I need another 15 minutes.

14:49.045 --> 14:52.745
Fine.

14:53.925 --> 14:57.294
- You all right?
- Just a little tired, like everyone else.

14:57.386 --> 14:59.794
No, I mean, about before.

14:59.889 --> 15:03.092
- It got tense between you and Carrie.
- I can handle Carrie.

15:03.184 --> 15:07.228
You don't have the training
or the experience to read a guy like Ali.

15:07.313 --> 15:10.848
- I shouldn't have put you in that position.
- We should press him.

15:10.942 --> 15:13.563
- They will in Guantanamo.
- It may be too late.

15:13.653 --> 15:17.982
We're sending him now. I'm heading over
to make sure the hand-off goes as planned.

15:18.074 --> 15:20.150
OK.

15:24.747 --> 15:28.448
General Bowden, my understanding is
it'll take between eight and ten weeks

15:28.542 --> 15:34.545
to call up reserve troops and redeploy
forces for a full-scale ground assault.

15:34.632 --> 15:38.760
We have the resources in place
to initiate a rolling start immediately.

15:38.844 --> 15:40.007
Rolling start?

15:40.096 --> 15:44.971
Surgical strikes against early-warning
radar and anti-aircraft installations,

15:45.059 --> 15:48.594
followed immediately by bombing
of targets that will degrade

15:48.688 --> 15:51.891
their military
and telecommunications capabilities.

15:51.983 --> 15:57.938
Can these first strikes be underway by
the time I address the nation this morning?

16:00.366 --> 16:04.067
- When are you scheduled to go on the air?
- Six hours from now.

16:04.161 --> 16:06.450
We'll be ready, sir.

16:07.957 --> 16:10.495
Mr President.

16:10.585 --> 16:14.369
Gentlemen, ladies, would you hold, please?

16:15.590 --> 16:18.163
Deputy Prime Minister Barghouti is calling.

16:18.259 --> 16:21.260
It's his second call
since the bomb was detonated.

16:21.345 --> 16:25.295
We're well past the point of words.
We're about to invade his country.

16:25.391 --> 16:27.133
But he doesn't know that yet.

16:27.200 --> 16:31.844
If you don't take his phone call,
he may read between the lines.

16:47.413 --> 16:50.864
- Mr Deputy Prime Minister.
- Thank you for taking my call.

16:50.958 --> 16:55.170
The Prime Minister wanted me to express
his outrage for what has occurred.

16:55.254 --> 16:56.193
Thank you.

16:56.493 --> 16:59.667
That you found the
bomb in time is truly a miracle.

16:59.759 --> 17:02.463
I'm not sure I believe in miracles, sir.

17:02.553 --> 17:05.637
- My people are good at what they do.
- Indeed they are.

17:05.723 --> 17:10.051
I'm sure you're aware that we've arrested
one of your citizens in connection to it.

17:10.144 --> 17:16.229
- Syed Ali.
- An outlaw. He has eluded us for years.

17:16.317 --> 17:19.483
Expect our full cooperation
with his punishment.

17:19.569 --> 17:22.405
I would expect nothing less.

17:22.490 --> 17:27.828
I realise we've had our differences, and
today has been an especially trying day,

17:27.912 --> 17:30.664
but we are both fighting the same battle.

17:30.748 --> 17:34.876
My government remains dedicated
to the destruction of Second Wave,

17:34.961 --> 17:39.172
as well as any other terrorist organisation
that may have been responsible

17:39.257 --> 17:41.333
for this atrocity.

17:41.425 --> 17:43.833
That's good to know.

17:43.928 --> 17:47.593
I understand you will be under
a great deal of political pressure

17:47.682 --> 17:50.220
to respond to what has happened.

17:50.309 --> 17:53.144
I'm confident that you have
the strength to resist.

17:53.229 --> 17:59.267
Don't be concerned about a rush to judgment.
We're merely gathering evidence.

17:59.360 --> 18:04.318
- I appreciate your candour, Mr President.
- And I appreciate your solidarity.

18:04.407 --> 18:07.657
- Of course.
- You'll hear from me soon.

18:16.002 --> 18:18.290
Come on, let's go.

18:40.776 --> 18:44.608
- Hey, Jack. I'm glad you're OK.
- Thanks.

18:44.697 --> 18:47.651
I'll get out of your way.
How can I get ahold of Kim?

18:47.742 --> 18:52.404
I spoke to a Sergeant Griggs
with the San Jose Sheriffs Department.

18:52.496 --> 18:57.538
He sent a man to your sister-in-law's
to meet Kim. That's his number.

18:57.627 --> 19:00.378
OK, thanks.

19:00.463 --> 19:06.168
- George told me he put you in charge.
- Yeah. How about that, huh?

19:06.260 --> 19:09.214
Trial by fire, right?

19:09.305 --> 19:13.634
- You're gonna do great.
- Look, we'll catch up later, all right?

19:13.726 --> 19:15.802
Yeah.

19:35.748 --> 19:37.954
- Sheriff's Department.
- Is Griggs there?

19:38.042 --> 19:40.118
- I can help.
- I need to speak with him.

19:40.211 --> 19:42.916
- He's not here.
- Is this not his personal line?

19:43.005 --> 19:45.212
- What is this regarding?
- I'm Jack Bauer.

19:45.299 --> 19:49.000
- It's regarding my daughter.
- Sergeant Griggs isn't available.

19:49.095 --> 19:51.846
If your daughter is in any danger,
let me assist you.

19:51.931 --> 19:55.382
No, she's not in any immediate danger.

19:55.476 --> 19:58.810
Listen, ma'am...
Fine, just give me the number.

19:58.896 --> 20:02.561
- Same area code, 555-9464.
- OK.

20:04.193 --> 20:07.028
- I'm glad you're OK, Jack.
- Thanks.

20:07.113 --> 20:11.691
I know Tony's running things,
and I don't want to speak out of turn, but...

20:11.784 --> 20:14.109
- I don't know who to talk to.
- About what?

20:14.203 --> 20:19.624
The president's planning military action
based on a recording from Ali's apartment.

20:19.709 --> 20:22.710
It links officials from three
governments to the nuke.

20:22.795 --> 20:26.496
The problem is... Ali claims it was a fake.

20:26.591 --> 20:28.963
- And you believe him.
- I don't know.

20:29.051 --> 20:31.969
We ought to be sure
before we retaliate against them.

20:32.054 --> 20:35.388
That's Tony's call.
I'm trying to get ahold of my daughter.

20:35.474 --> 20:38.226
I understand,
but you're the one who broke Ali.

20:38.311 --> 20:44.100
You can read him better than anyone here.
Please, Jack, before Ali is gone.

20:44.191 --> 20:47.027
Only he can prove
whether the recording is real.

20:47.111 --> 20:49.187
Fine, I'll talk to him.

20:49.280 --> 20:54.820
See if you can get ahold of this Sergeant
Griggs. Tell him it's regarding my daughter.

21:06.505 --> 21:10.835
- Sheriff's Department.
- This is Michelle Dessler over at CTU.

21:10.927 --> 21:14.426
- I'm looking for Sergeant Griggs.
- Please hold.

21:20.144 --> 21:22.552
There you go.

21:22.647 --> 21:24.723
Bring him out.

21:37.745 --> 21:41.244
I just wanna talk to him
before they get him to Guantanamo.

21:41.332 --> 21:44.452
Gentlemen... hold up.

21:44.543 --> 21:47.035
Let me have a word with the prisoner.

21:49.131 --> 21:54.921
I want you to know we didn't
kill your son. We staged it.

21:55.012 --> 21:59.092
When you get to Guantanamo,
they'll let you speak with your family.

22:00.017 --> 22:04.264
I need to know something.
The Cyprus recording, is it fake?

22:05.940 --> 22:08.561
What I told the woman was true.

22:14.323 --> 22:17.408
Thank you.

22:17.493 --> 22:20.660
We got shots fired on the north roof!

22:22.415 --> 22:26.495
Get back here. He's dead.
You got a radio on you?

22:26.586 --> 22:29.337
Tell them inside,
Syed Ali has just been shot.

22:29.422 --> 22:33.799
We've got a shooter on one
of the southwest roofs. Tell 'em now!

22:33.884 --> 22:38.463
This is Primary Escort. We have
a prisoner down and a sniper on the roof.

22:52.827 --> 22:55.698
Would you take care of that for me?

22:55.788 --> 23:00.747
- LAPD say the perimeter's set up.
- How'd anybody know we were moving him?

23:00.835 --> 23:04.536
Intelligence knew we had him.
The leak could have come from anywhere.

23:04.631 --> 23:08.249
Shooter's gotta be connected
to a country implicated on the recording.

23:08.343 --> 23:12.043
- Maybe.
- They had the most to lose by Ali talking.

23:12.138 --> 23:17.512
- Who else would it have been?
- Ali might have been telling the truth.

23:17.602 --> 23:20.437
- You talked to Michelle.
- No, I talked to Ali.

23:20.521 --> 23:24.187
- Captain Raskind from LAPD for you.
- One minute, please.

23:24.275 --> 23:28.225
You're taking Syed Ali's word
over every expert we have?

23:28.321 --> 23:30.859
Tony, Ali was killed for a reason.

23:30.949 --> 23:34.531
Find out if it was cos he could prove
the recording was fabricated.

23:34.619 --> 23:37.490
- Our best people have verified it.
- Fine.

23:37.580 --> 23:41.530
- Keep the door open, assign men to it.
- I don't have any men to spare.

23:41.626 --> 23:45.671
We're processing intel from nine countries,
and I think this is a dead end.

23:45.755 --> 23:49.290
- Captain Raskind wants to know...
- Could you give me a minute?

23:49.384 --> 23:51.590
Thank you.

23:51.678 --> 23:56.055
Tony, the president is gonna make
some very, very serious decisions

23:56.140 --> 23:59.474
based on the information
that he got from that recording.

23:59.561 --> 24:02.727
If it's not genuine,
you have a responsibility...

24:02.814 --> 24:05.519
You're gonna lecture me on responsibility?

24:05.608 --> 24:07.312
We both know how you work.

24:07.512 --> 24:11.314
You consider going against the
grain some kind of a virtue.

24:11.406 --> 24:12.665
Why are you talking to me like this?

24:12.760 --> 24:15.984
I got a job to do,
I don't wanna be told how.

24:16.077 --> 24:19.078
I'm just trying to help.

24:19.163 --> 24:21.868
I don't need your help, Jack.

24:21.958 --> 24:26.003
Don't get me wrong, I appreciate
everything you've done for us today.

24:26.087 --> 24:28.040
But I think it's time you
go get your daughter,

24:28.058 --> 24:32.172
let us handle the restof this,
all right?

24:32.260 --> 24:33.968
Yeah, fine.

24:40.059 --> 24:43.475
- Thanks. Yeah.
- Mr Almeida...

25:13.843 --> 25:18.090
All circuits are busy.
Please try your call again.

25:18.181 --> 25:20.387
Some kind of problem?

25:22.227 --> 25:24.682
Can I just use the bathroom?

25:26.522 --> 25:30.472
- Please, I'll be quick.
- All right, come on.

25:36.324 --> 25:39.029
In the back, on your left. Watch your step.

25:51.965 --> 25:56.093
Casualty estimates for the initial air
campaign are minimal. A dozen at most.

25:56.177 --> 25:59.427
- And the ground campaign?
- There are numerous scenarios,

25:59.514 --> 26:01.886
depending on how long the campaign lasts,

26:01.975 --> 26:05.924
if chemical or biological weapons
are deployed against our troops.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.392
Which, frankly, I think they will be.

26:09.524 --> 26:13.771
OK, take that all into account,
then give me a number, General.

26:14.737 --> 26:20.277
A simultaneous ground assault against
the three countries, which lasts five weeks,

26:20.368 --> 26:25.030
will result in ten to thirty thousand
American casualties.

26:32.589 --> 26:36.456
And if China and Russia
enter the conflict against us?

26:36.551 --> 26:40.251
There's no upper limit
to that number, Mr President.

26:40.346 --> 26:46.100
But it's unlikely. They'll want to insinuate
themselves into control of the oil fields.

26:46.185 --> 26:50.397
- Yes.
- I have Jack Bauer. It's an emergency.

26:50.481 --> 26:54.775
One moment.
Sir, it's Jack Bauer for you.

26:57.113 --> 26:59.984
Excuse me again.

27:01.534 --> 27:05.366
It's good to hear your voice,
but I'm in a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.

27:05.455 --> 27:08.456
I felt this was important enough
to interrupt you.

27:08.541 --> 27:10.866
Syed Ali has just been assassinated.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.329
CTU was transferring him over
to Guantanamo when it happened.

27:14.422 --> 27:17.708
- What are you talking about? By whom?
- We don't know yet, sir.

27:17.800 --> 27:21.383
I think it has to do with the conversation
recorded in Cyprus.

27:21.471 --> 27:24.341
Mr President, I don't believe it's genuine.

27:24.432 --> 27:29.675
- That recording was authenticated.
- Sir, authentication is never 100 percent.

27:29.771 --> 27:31.514
Do you have evidence?

27:31.606 --> 27:35.438
Ali said he was in Berlin
when the conversation took place.

27:35.527 --> 27:40.438
- He said the recording was fabricated.
- OK, I'm aware of his denials.

27:40.532 --> 27:44.197
Mr President, I'm worried that
someone is trying to manipulate you

27:44.285 --> 27:48.365
into taking the kind of military action
I assume you're about to take.

27:48.456 --> 27:54.909
Look, the fact that Syed Ali was killed does
not prove that the recording was fabricated.

27:55.004 --> 27:58.208
No, sir. I know that. I know it doesn't.

27:59.384 --> 28:03.084
But I feel a responsibility to tell you
I believe he was assassinated

28:03.179 --> 28:06.216
because he was in fact telling the truth.

28:07.058 --> 28:09.347
Do you have any hard evidence, Jack?

28:09.435 --> 28:12.555
Aside from Ali's denials, no, sir.
Nothing concrete.

28:12.647 --> 28:18.899
Listen to me. I don't wanna initiate a military
action based on erroneous information.

28:18.987 --> 28:23.696
- But I can't stop it based on conjecture.
- I understand, sir, I do.

28:24.576 --> 28:27.493
If I were to get you proof,
how much time would I have?

28:27.579 --> 28:30.449
Our military response
is only hours away, Jack.

28:31.291 --> 28:37.459
- You better do it soon.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr President.

28:50.642 --> 28:55.600
We don't have any updates. As soon
as we do, we'll patch them through to you.

28:58.525 --> 29:00.850
- This is Dessler.
- Michelle, it's Jack.

29:00.944 --> 29:04.064
I want you to keep this
information between us, OK?

29:04.155 --> 29:09.280
I talked to the president. He will not halt
any military action unless we provide proof.

29:09.369 --> 29:11.445
Ali was our only proof.

29:11.538 --> 29:15.405
There's gotta be another way
to establish Ali's presence at that time.

29:15.500 --> 29:18.454
Other foreign agencies
must have been tracking him.

29:18.545 --> 29:23.088
- An official from a target country is here.
- What? Here at CTU? Why?

29:23.174 --> 29:25.381
We struck an agreement earlier today.

29:25.468 --> 29:28.553
He's the one who escorted
evidence from Ali's apartment.

29:28.638 --> 29:30.844
- Think he knows something?
- He might.

29:30.932 --> 29:34.597
Tony doesn't want him talking to anyone.

29:34.686 --> 29:38.766
- OK, fine, what's his name?
- Yusuf Auda. A-U-D-A.

29:38.857 --> 29:42.557
I'll pull up his CV and run a background
check. I'll get back to you.

29:51.119 --> 29:54.239
- Jack?
- Kate.

29:55.206 --> 29:59.500
I didn't think...
I thought you weren't coming back.

30:00.295 --> 30:03.165
I didn't think I was either.

30:03.256 --> 30:06.506
- How?
- It's a long story.

30:08.136 --> 30:12.964
But everything's OK, right?
They said the bomb was detonated safely.

30:13.058 --> 30:16.177
No. Everything's fine. It's gonna be fine.

30:16.269 --> 30:18.938
How are you? Are you OK?

30:19.022 --> 30:22.058
Yeah. My dad's still a little shaken up.

30:22.984 --> 30:25.060
I'm sorry.

30:25.153 --> 30:28.356
- Miss Warner.
- I have to go.

30:28.448 --> 30:32.493
- She needs to be debriefed.
- OK. We'll see you in a little while.

30:33.286 --> 30:37.200
- I'm really glad you're OK.
- Thanks.

30:48.176 --> 30:53.171
The Joint Chiefs are revising down their material
estimate between 10 and 20 per cent.

30:55.100 --> 30:59.477
- That's good news, sir.
- None of this is good news, Mike.

31:00.480 --> 31:04.809
General Bowden is ready to walk you
through the strategy statement.

31:04.901 --> 31:08.104
- I need a few more minutes.
- How long should I tell him?

31:08.196 --> 31:10.901
When I'm ready, Mike.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.790
What is it, Mr President?

31:27.590 --> 31:31.968
The telephone conversation with Jack Bauer
keeps playing in my head.

31:33.138 --> 31:36.174
I'm worried that we may be moving too fast.

31:37.934 --> 31:44.387
Mr President, your ability to analyse
a situation is your strongest asset.

31:45.984 --> 31:48.439
But it's also your greatest liability.

31:50.655 --> 31:52.935
I don't wanna make a mistake...

31:53.135 --> 31:56.740
that our children and their
children will have to pay for.

31:56.828 --> 31:59.699
Sir, we have evidence
that's been confirmed

31:59.789 --> 32:04.167
by every military and intelligence expert
on the payroll.

32:05.837 --> 32:08.209
Everyone except Jack Bauer.

32:08.298 --> 32:10.753
It's natural for you to be having doubts.

32:10.842 --> 32:13.463
I'd be worried if you weren't having doubts.

32:13.553 --> 32:19.757
But when the public learns what happened,
they'll want a decisive response.

32:19.851 --> 32:21.974
They'll demand it.

32:22.062 --> 32:24.731
We're not responding to satisfy bloodlust.

32:24.814 --> 32:27.103
No, sir, we're not.

32:27.192 --> 32:31.236
We're responding because three countries
colluded with a terrorist group

32:31.321 --> 32:33.693
to explode a nuclear bomb on our soil.

32:33.782 --> 32:36.189
- And we have proof.
- What if the proof is a lie?

32:36.284 --> 32:39.819
- It isn't.
- Are you sure, Mike?

32:42.540 --> 32:44.616
Are you sure?

32:50.715 --> 32:55.922
I'll tell General Bowden you'll call...
when you're ready.

33:19.369 --> 33:23.698
- Mr Auda, my name is Jack Bauer.
- Don't give me another excuse.

33:23.790 --> 33:28.535
I need to ask you a few questions about
the evidence taken from Syed Ali's apartment.

33:28.628 --> 33:33.753
How would I know what was found?
You people refuse to include me. Ask them.

33:33.842 --> 33:37.886
My colleagues might not be interested
in the same questions that I am.

33:37.971 --> 33:42.799
I'm trying to determine whether or not
the evidence could've been compromised.

33:44.018 --> 33:47.138
Before I tell you anything,
tell me what you know.

33:47.230 --> 33:53.351
Whatever was found, they're keeping it from
me, suggesting it incriminates my country.

33:53.445 --> 33:56.814
I'm sorry. You and I are not even
supposed to be talking.

33:56.906 --> 33:59.860
You're asking me to help,
offering nothing in return.

33:59.951 --> 34:03.616
- I know I'm asking a lot.
- Asking too much.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.126
This is Bauer.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.998
- Hello, Jack.
- Who is this?

34:13.089 --> 34:18.545
The only person who can prove Syed Ali was
not in Cyprus in April, meeting Arab leaders.

34:18.636 --> 34:22.848
The recording they found, in case
you haven't figured it out, is bogus.

34:22.931 --> 34:26.183
- How do you know that?
- Because I'm the one who planted it.

34:26.268 --> 34:30.098
On April 5, I placed
it in Ali's apartment.

34:30.598 --> 34:32.353
And I'm supposed to believe you?

34:32.442 --> 34:37.270
You don't have a choice. That's why I killed
Ali, so you'd have to deal with me.

34:37.364 --> 34:41.147
- How do I know you killed him?
- I almost had to take you out too.

34:41.242 --> 34:45.074
But you moved. I'm dying to know
what you two were talking about.

34:45.163 --> 34:48.199
- What do you want?
- Kate Warner.

34:50.335 --> 34:52.873
Why? Why do you want her?

34:52.962 --> 34:57.423
Get her out of CTU. Bring her to the
intersection of Meridian and Moorpark.

34:57.509 --> 35:00.628
There's a warehouse.
Look for a door under a neon sign.

35:00.720 --> 35:05.512
- My access at CTU is limited at best.
- You're resourceful. You'll find a way.

35:05.600 --> 35:09.301
- You didn't answer. Why do you want her?
- Don't worry about that now.

35:09.396 --> 35:12.017
She hasn't been released.
She's in debriefing.

35:12.107 --> 35:15.226
You got 30 minutes.
Bring her to the warehouse.

35:15.318 --> 35:18.070
30 minutes is not enough time.

35:47.324 --> 35:48.984
What's the problem?

35:49.076 --> 35:53.156
You'll have a problem
if you don't get out. I'll call the cops.

35:53.247 --> 35:56.413
It's nothing like that!
I just need a few things!

35:56.500 --> 36:02.254
Will you lighten up? My wife's pregnant.
Here's some money.

36:03.048 --> 36:04.922
- I'll be quick.
- Keep moving.

36:05.008 --> 36:07.796
- You have to help me.
- Sorry, I can't do anything.

36:07.886 --> 36:10.721
- I'll pay you, all right? How much?
- I don't...

36:10.806 --> 36:13.475
- Don't walk away!
- Just find another store.

36:13.559 --> 36:16.394
How hard would it be
to open up for one minute?!

36:16.478 --> 36:20.096
There's another store ten miles
down the road, west on Route 14.

36:20.190 --> 36:24.733
- No, we're going to the mountains!
- I'm closed. I'm not gonna tell you again.

36:24.820 --> 36:27.856
- Don't you know what's going on?!
- I'm calling the cops.

36:27.948 --> 36:32.527
- Look, I have cash. I'll pay you double.
- I already closed out the register.

36:32.619 --> 36:38.159
Please, tell him to let me in.
My wife's pregnant. She can't be here.

36:38.250 --> 36:42.876
- Look, open the damn door!
- That's it. That is it.

36:44.006 --> 36:47.090
- Come on!
- 911?

36:47.176 --> 36:49.417
Some guy's trying to bust into my store.

36:49.511 --> 36:52.049
- Is the store open?
- No, but he's threatening me.

36:52.139 --> 36:56.350
- What's your location?
- It's King's Liquor, Soledad Canyon Road.

36:56.435 --> 36:58.724
Officers are on their way.

37:01.023 --> 37:05.435
They always come out at night.
All kinds of crazy people.

37:06.028 --> 37:08.898
- It's starting.
- What?

37:10.824 --> 37:13.944
- Nothing.
- Don't give me that.

37:14.036 --> 37:18.365
"It's starting." What the hell's
that supposed to mean?

37:27.800 --> 37:29.876
No! Stop it!

37:31.637 --> 37:33.962
Stop!

37:37.351 --> 37:41.395
You should have let me in.
I told you to let me in!

37:43.649 --> 37:47.018
Let go of him and get up!
I said, let go of him!

37:47.110 --> 37:49.732
Now get out of here!

37:49.822 --> 37:53.653
I didn't mean for this to happen.
I'm just trying to get to the mountains.

37:53.742 --> 37:56.150
I said, go!

37:59.540 --> 38:01.828
Give me the gun.

38:05.170 --> 38:09.038
- I'm not gonna hurt anyone, I promise.
- Just go.

38:12.469 --> 38:14.794
Go!

38:34.658 --> 38:37.742
- Michelle Dessler.
- Hey, it's me, Jack.

38:37.828 --> 38:42.406
- Was Yusuf Auda helpful?
- No, not yet. He's got some trust issues.

38:43.584 --> 38:45.660
I'm right behind you.

38:45.752 --> 38:49.964
I think there's another way to prove
that the Cyprus recording was faked.

38:50.048 --> 38:53.714
But I'm gonna need your help -
you're gonna have to trust me.

38:55.429 --> 39:00.803
- Yeah, whatever you need.
- OK, I'll get back to you in a minute.

39:02.644 --> 39:07.437
You should have let me in when I asked you.
My wife is seven months pregnant.

39:07.524 --> 39:09.813
- I didn't want to hurt anyone.
- Just go.

39:11.820 --> 39:16.981
After I pay. I told you I had money,
I didn't come here to steal.

39:17.075 --> 39:20.444
- I said, I wanna pay!
- All right, all right, all right.

39:20.537 --> 39:22.696
I'm not a criminal.

39:25.209 --> 39:27.960
Turn on the TV.

39:28.045 --> 39:31.793
Speculation has continued
to grow around the explosion

39:31.882 --> 39:35.547
spotted by two commercial aircraft
and a weather satellite.

39:35.636 --> 39:38.590
While a statement from the president
is forthcoming,

39:38.680 --> 39:44.185
one source suggested that the blast could
only have been caused by a nuclear explosion.

39:44.269 --> 39:48.433
It's true. My brother works
at a USGS station in Palmdale.

39:48.524 --> 39:53.862
- He overheard a scientist talking.
- You knew about this, didn't you?

40:06.959 --> 40:11.621
- Keep your hands where I can see them.
- Hey, leave her alone!

40:12.881 --> 40:15.088
Give me the gun.

40:15.175 --> 40:17.464
No.

40:17.553 --> 40:21.681
Put the gun down
and come out with your hands up.

40:21.765 --> 40:25.430
I said, put the gun down
and come out with your hands up.

40:32.317 --> 40:35.105
How long did the two men talk?

40:35.195 --> 40:37.271
Just for a few minutes at a time.

40:37.364 --> 40:40.863
And it was mostly in Arabic,
which I understand a little bit.

40:40.951 --> 40:43.027
They didn't seem...

40:43.120 --> 40:46.868
too much in a hurry about anything.

40:46.957 --> 40:49.329
Do you think that they knew each other well?

40:49.418 --> 40:54.246
- Yeah, like they were partners.
- Baker?

40:54.339 --> 40:57.044
- Yeah.
- You did the Macauley interview last week?

40:57.134 --> 40:58.379
I did.

40:58.469 --> 41:02.134
A page is missing from the transcript.
Have a copy of the original?

41:02.222 --> 41:07.596
- Yeah, but I have another hour here.
- Can't wait. Division wants it right now.

41:08.353 --> 41:10.807
I'm glad I double-checked
before it got sent.

41:11.507 --> 41:12.565
Sorry, I'll be right back.

41:12.649 --> 41:14.725
OK.

41:24.578 --> 41:26.654
I need you to come with me now.

41:26.747 --> 41:29.867
I'm still with Baker,
then I have to deal with my father.

41:29.958 --> 41:32.366
- This is urgent.
- What's going on?

41:32.461 --> 41:34.537
You said everything was fine.

41:34.630 --> 41:37.500
It's not. I'll explain in the car.

41:50.020 --> 41:52.309
- Almeida.
- Yeah, it's Carrie.

41:52.397 --> 41:55.351
- What's up?
- Unless I'm misreading the situation,

41:55.442 --> 42:00.437
- Jack is trying to remove Kate from CTU.
- I'll be right down.

42:00.531 --> 42:02.856
Oh, God!

42:05.994 --> 42:10.122
- Come on.
- I didn't mean to! He came at me!

42:10.207 --> 42:14.833
Please don't let him die!
Look, I didn't mean for this to happen!

42:14.920 --> 42:19.463
It was a mistake!
I was just trying to protect my wife.

42:21.635 --> 42:26.012
- Lower level, space eleven.
- Thanks, Brian. Come on, Kate.

42:28.142 --> 42:31.392
- Where the hell you going?
- I don't have time to explain.

42:31.478 --> 42:34.148
- Let's find the time.
- What are you doing?

42:34.231 --> 42:38.229
Kate, you stay against the wall.
Tony, put down the gun.

42:38.318 --> 42:41.106
Not till you tell me what
you're doing, Jack.

42:44.032 --> 42:46.440
I'm sorry, I can't.

42:47.619 --> 42:53.159
Who do you think you're kidding? You're
not gonna shoot me. Put the gun down.

42:53.584 --> 42:56.122
Put the gun down.

42:57.671 --> 43:01.040
Kate, come on, we gotta go.
Now. Let's go.

43:02.759 --> 43:05.630
Jack! Jack!
