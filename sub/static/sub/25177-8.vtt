00:07.785 --> 00:09.353
Previously on Cloak and Dagger...

00:09.354 --> 00:11.688
This guy, Connors, gives me
an ache in my big toe.

00:11.689 --> 00:13.457
You think we can get him
for killing my big brother?

00:13.458 --> 00:15.058
O'Reilly!

00:15.059 --> 00:16.293
No!

00:17.562 --> 00:20.163
It protects me,
it's looking out for me.

00:20.164 --> 00:22.332
- Then why'd you pick this one?
- It spoke to me, I guess.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.567
That was your brother's.

00:23.568 --> 00:25.469
Peter Scarborough
took everything of my dad's

00:25.470 --> 00:26.603
and said it belonged to Roxxon.

00:26.604 --> 00:28.105
What's up with all these blueprints?

00:28.106 --> 00:29.573
Did you design the
new Roxxon building?

00:29.574 --> 00:30.741
You're Ivan Hess.

00:30.742 --> 00:32.042
Can you tell us what happened here?

00:32.043 --> 00:33.610
The initial energy expulsion,

00:33.611 --> 00:36.346
it turns everyone into bloodthirsty
monsters. I call them "terrors."

00:36.347 --> 00:37.914
Your dad? He was right.

00:37.915 --> 00:39.483
He usually was.

00:40.485 --> 00:42.386
I can't see him anywhere!

00:42.387 --> 00:44.647
We've gotta get back to the spaceship.

00:47.325 --> 00:50.127
He has a laser.

00:50.128 --> 00:52.062
One, two, three, four?

00:53.998 --> 00:55.732
- Billy, come on.
- Hmm?

00:59.804 --> 01:01.605
No, no, no.

01:01.606 --> 01:03.440
- Leave it on.
- Why?

01:04.375 --> 01:06.076
One, two, three, four.

01:06.077 --> 01:07.944
I declare a thumb war.

01:07.945 --> 01:10.380
Oh! Close one, Ty.

01:10.381 --> 01:11.548
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:11.549 --> 01:14.084
Life is full of distractions.

01:14.085 --> 01:15.352
You need to overcome them.

01:15.353 --> 01:17.287
Go ahead. Try again.

01:19.991 --> 01:21.958
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three. Gotcha.

01:22.860 --> 01:24.494
I'll never beat you!

01:24.495 --> 01:26.163
You will someday.

01:26.164 --> 01:27.831
But you'll always be bigger than me.

01:27.832 --> 01:30.067
Are you kidding?
You gonna be tall as a tree.

01:30.068 --> 01:31.668
Giant thumbs, whooping my ass.

01:31.669 --> 01:33.503
Hey. Language.

01:36.074 --> 01:37.374
When will I be your age?

01:37.375 --> 01:38.975
When I'm older, you'll be older.

01:38.976 --> 01:40.711
Will I be just like you?

01:40.712 --> 01:42.879
Nah.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.147
You could be better.

01:45.149 --> 01:46.450
How's this for pressure?

01:46.451 --> 01:48.018
If you fall down,

01:48.019 --> 01:50.454
you'll never get to play ballet again.

01:50.455 --> 01:53.156
You don't play ballet, Dad.

01:53.157 --> 01:54.424
Oh, you don't?

01:54.425 --> 01:56.593
No, you dance.

01:57.595 --> 01:59.029
Do you really want to be a dancer?

01:59.030 --> 02:00.964
More than anything.

02:00.965 --> 02:02.365
Then hold yourself up.

02:03.801 --> 02:07.003
Bigger. Stronger. Braver.

02:07.004 --> 02:08.805
Hey, I mean it.

02:11.542 --> 02:13.510
"Bigger, stronger, braver."

02:14.545 --> 02:16.947
Even if someone else falls down,

02:16.948 --> 02:18.749
- that's how you succeed.
- Ready to go!

02:18.750 --> 02:20.751
You hold up.

02:20.752 --> 02:23.153
'Cause you're my little girl, okay?

02:23.154 --> 02:24.454
Okay.

02:24.455 --> 02:26.156
What?

02:30.895 --> 02:32.195
Good day today.

02:32.196 --> 02:35.031
Pirouette, fifth and close.

02:35.032 --> 02:37.234
Perfect, Katie.
The rest of you are close.

02:39.237 --> 02:41.905
So, what we gonna do?

02:43.307 --> 02:45.642
Daddy!

02:49.385 --> 02:53.489
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<font color="#FF0000"><b>awaqeded</b></font> for <font color="#FF0000"><b>www.addic7ed.com.</b></font>

02:57.054 --> 02:59.489
So, will these be celebration pancakes

02:59.490 --> 03:01.391
- or comfort pancakes?
- Neither.

03:04.128 --> 03:06.229
I passed the psych evaluation.

03:06.230 --> 03:07.430
I said all the right things.

03:07.431 --> 03:09.499
And don't feel like
celebrating. I get it.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.169
- I did shoot a guy.
- In self-defense.

03:12.170 --> 03:13.937
I'm not sure it's as simple as that.

03:13.938 --> 03:15.338
What do you mean?

03:18.075 --> 03:19.276
Is it Connors?

03:20.211 --> 03:21.645
Think he had more to do with it?

03:24.248 --> 03:26.583
- These are good.
- Yeah?

03:26.584 --> 03:28.685
- There's more where that came from.
- Really?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.453
I like making girlfriend pancakes.

03:31.856 --> 03:34.824
- I'm your girlfriend?
- You are eating the pancakes.

03:39.764 --> 03:41.364
I'm gonna take down Connors.

03:44.402 --> 03:45.902
No.

03:45.903 --> 03:47.170
We are.

03:49.707 --> 03:50.974
But how?

03:53.444 --> 03:55.111
We'll be in touch.

03:57.000 --> 04:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:15.466 --> 04:16.933
Tandy?

04:18.269 --> 04:19.769
Hey, Mr. Hess.

04:21.639 --> 04:22.872
These are for you.

04:24.442 --> 04:25.508
Little Tandy's a young woman,

04:25.509 --> 04:26.876
so's Mina.

04:29.247 --> 04:30.847
Thank you for the flowers.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.050
Did Scarborough bring you anything?

04:34.051 --> 04:36.686
Paperwork.

04:36.687 --> 04:39.956
He wanted to make sure I wasn't
a liability, and I'm not.

04:39.957 --> 04:41.825
I don't remember anything
after that night.

04:41.826 --> 04:44.394
But you do remember that night?

04:45.563 --> 04:48.565
All your fellow rig workers
going aggro?

04:48.566 --> 04:51.334
You guys weren't
drilling for oil, right?

04:51.335 --> 04:54.304
We didn't know what it was exactly.

04:54.305 --> 04:56.339
Your father, he did have a theory,

04:56.340 --> 04:58.942
about the energy
below the surface being...

05:00.278 --> 05:02.212
ancient, special.

05:02.213 --> 05:03.580
Toxic to humans.

05:05.149 --> 05:06.416
I don't remember much.

05:06.417 --> 05:07.550
I'm sorry.

05:09.153 --> 05:12.789
You are the only
first-hand account there is.

05:13.791 --> 05:15.358
And they blame my dad...

05:15.359 --> 05:16.459
for everything.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.463
There's, um...

05:21.766 --> 05:24.768
There's something
I didn't tell Scarborough.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.470
Your dad wrote a memo

05:27.471 --> 05:30.707
warning the company
about the design of the rig.

05:32.076 --> 05:34.311
I should've listened to your father.

05:34.312 --> 05:36.112
He saw Roxxon cutting corners.

05:36.113 --> 05:37.447
I thought he was just being paranoid.

05:37.448 --> 05:39.816
Okay, so this memo,
do you... do you have it?

05:42.186 --> 05:44.387
Nathan put it in a safe deposit box...

05:45.389 --> 05:47.824
with other evidence, just in case.

05:47.825 --> 05:50.660
Metrolake Bank.

05:50.661 --> 05:53.129
It'll be under the name
"Bernoulli." It's an old joke.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.864
Long story.

05:54.865 --> 05:57.600
Now, this can't come
back to me, but...

05:57.601 --> 06:00.870
Roxxon, they can be... dangerous.

06:01.772 --> 06:02.872
Petty.

06:03.774 --> 06:05.175
And my daughter...

06:06.177 --> 06:08.511
- Her entire future...
- I understand.

06:09.447 --> 06:10.914
You have a lot to lose.

06:12.483 --> 06:13.917
You're lucky.

06:19.223 --> 06:20.723
Mom?

06:22.526 --> 06:25.595
- Hey!
- Hey.

06:27.164 --> 06:30.033
You look really nice.

06:30.034 --> 06:32.302
Oh, thank you.

06:32.303 --> 06:33.803
And thank you.

06:43.147 --> 06:44.681
Mm. It's great.

06:45.816 --> 06:47.517
Sure you don't want
to add a little kick?

06:47.518 --> 06:49.652
Not today.

06:50.988 --> 06:53.757
Speaking of, look, I know that
you haven't been showing up

06:53.758 --> 06:55.825
for the memorial tradition
these past few years...

06:55.826 --> 06:58.995
Mom. I wanna be there.

07:00.264 --> 07:02.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:04.135 --> 07:06.803
- Really.
- Then we'll need the perfect balloon.

07:06.804 --> 07:09.185
What do you think we should get?

07:09.974 --> 07:12.208
Anything.

07:12.209 --> 07:15.812
Just not like that one time
you got the Bar Mitzvah balloon.

07:15.813 --> 07:17.914
That was pretty hilarious.

07:17.915 --> 07:19.983
Up into the sky to honor Dad's memory.

07:19.984 --> 07:21.551
Mazel Tov!

07:25.289 --> 07:26.422
You know what?

07:27.892 --> 07:29.192
I'll get the balloon.

07:33.998 --> 07:35.899
So, um...

07:35.900 --> 07:38.468
do you remember Dad
keeping a safe deposit box?

07:38.469 --> 07:41.371
Sure. For his work stuff.

07:42.306 --> 07:45.308
I went crazy for years
trying to find it, but...

07:45.309 --> 07:46.943
there's no record of it in the city.

07:47.845 --> 07:49.345
I might have a theory.

07:49.346 --> 07:50.813
A theory?

07:51.849 --> 07:53.383
I'm my father's daughter.

08:03.694 --> 08:05.395
How's your day look, Tyrone?

08:06.864 --> 08:08.131
Today?

08:09.033 --> 08:10.867
- Seriously?
- What?

08:13.070 --> 08:14.270
Nothing.

08:26.584 --> 08:28.284
I think the key's in here.

08:33.524 --> 08:34.791
Here it is.

08:35.759 --> 08:36.926
Great.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.384
I was pregnant with you.

09:01.385 --> 09:03.319
We'd had trouble before then, but...

09:04.989 --> 09:07.123
it was a rare night off.

09:07.124 --> 09:08.791
Your father always worked too much.

09:09.793 --> 09:11.828
But it was date night.

09:11.829 --> 09:13.162
We were at the ballet.

09:14.298 --> 09:15.918
I thought you guys were at the movies.

09:17.134 --> 09:18.768
You're right.

09:20.171 --> 09:22.739
Maybe I just wish
it was at the ballet.

09:22.740 --> 09:24.274
It sounds better.

09:25.576 --> 09:27.110
Let's say the ballet.

09:28.879 --> 09:30.113
Why not?

09:32.783 --> 09:34.050
We were at the ballet...

09:35.186 --> 09:37.253
and your dad took my hand.

09:51.101 --> 09:52.621
I was thinking I'd have the guys over.

09:55.839 --> 09:57.774
I was just thinking
I'd have the guys over!

09:57.775 --> 10:00.143
What guys? Red Hawks?

10:00.144 --> 10:01.778
Yeah.

10:01.779 --> 10:03.346
I have a busy day today.

10:03.347 --> 10:05.481
Yeah. We'll stay out of your way.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.010
They've never been to
my home in all these years.

10:10.421 --> 10:11.654
It's my turn to host.

10:11.655 --> 10:13.456
And we could all use some space

10:13.457 --> 10:15.024
to spread out and finish our work.

10:24.635 --> 10:26.703
- Can I come in?
- Not today.

10:26.704 --> 10:27.770
- Okay?
- Ty!

10:27.771 --> 10:30.607
Today is today for me too.

10:30.608 --> 10:34.010
Look, I've never had
a girl over before.

10:34.011 --> 10:35.979
Not that my parents know of.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.847
Relax, okay?

10:37.848 --> 10:39.949
- Parents love me.
- Yeah, I bet they do.

10:47.091 --> 10:49.192
Why are you here?

10:49.193 --> 10:51.628
What? No hug?

10:51.629 --> 10:53.329
- Not even a handshake?
- Come on, Tandy.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.465
Tyrone? Who's this?

10:55.466 --> 10:57.066
Oh, this is, um...

10:57.067 --> 10:59.335
- This is my friend.
- Tandy. Hi.

10:59.336 --> 11:01.537
Well, why did you
stop by today, Tandy?

11:01.538 --> 11:05.541
Um, today, I guess.

11:05.542 --> 11:08.511
Yeah, my dad died the same
night as Tyrone's brother.

11:08.512 --> 11:11.114
So I just thought
I'd come check on Ty.

11:11.115 --> 11:14.083
That's very nice
of you, Tandy. Thank you.

11:15.452 --> 11:18.054
Are you guys doing anything
special for Billy today?

11:19.890 --> 11:23.026
No. We're not.

11:23.027 --> 11:25.762
- We're just in the middle of breakfast.
- Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

11:25.763 --> 11:28.531
- I'll let you guys get back to it.
- Nice meeting you.

11:33.470 --> 11:34.837
You know if you wanna
come over tonight,

11:34.838 --> 11:36.606
my mom and I are doing something.

11:37.808 --> 11:40.910
It's small, but... it's something.

11:40.911 --> 11:43.980
Yeah. Okay, maybe.

11:43.981 --> 11:45.715
Cool.

12:45.242 --> 12:46.909
Hi, you've reached Tandy...

12:46.910 --> 12:48.177
And Melissa...

12:48.178 --> 12:49.312
And Nathan.

12:49.313 --> 12:51.414
The Bowen's! Leave a message.

13:04.928 --> 13:07.063
Hey, O'Reilly, get over here.

13:07.064 --> 13:08.631
I need your eyes.

13:17.174 --> 13:18.875
This was the kid, right?

13:19.910 --> 13:23.513
- What kid?
- The one who bolted after you fired

13:23.514 --> 13:26.682
up that yellow banister
and then disappeared.

13:26.683 --> 13:28.823
He ran out from behind me.
I didn't get a good look.

13:30.954 --> 13:32.355
That's him, Suzy.

13:33.490 --> 13:34.857
That's the little shit!

13:35.759 --> 13:38.127
Timing of it all is suspect.

13:39.263 --> 13:41.564
- That sounds personal.
- He got away.

13:41.565 --> 13:43.232
He's got to be found.

13:44.635 --> 13:46.369
He's got to be dealt with.

13:59.997 --> 14:01.965
- Hey!
- You know who it is.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.134
Alright, Big Chief.

14:09.206 --> 14:12.108
Look, man, I got to
check up in here, man!

14:12.109 --> 14:15.478
And look at this
big white whale of a couch.

14:15.479 --> 14:18.348
Ha! How's a man to sit
on a couch like that?

14:18.349 --> 14:19.716
- You don't.
- Huh?

14:19.717 --> 14:22.585
You just stand back and marvel at it.

14:22.586 --> 14:25.088
Oh, my, my, my. Crate and Barrel.

14:29.593 --> 14:32.028
- You know, I was tellin' Ty...
- Tyrone.

14:32.930 --> 14:35.198
- How you been, son?
- I'm good.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.268
Hard day, ain't it?

14:38.269 --> 14:40.036
Yeah, it's...

14:42.239 --> 14:44.107
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

14:48.212 --> 14:51.181
Mmm! Man! I tell you.

14:54.618 --> 14:58.588
I always thought the cloak he
started on was something special.

15:03.327 --> 15:04.494
Hey, what's the difference between

15:04.495 --> 15:06.296
a cloak and a cape anyway?

15:06.297 --> 15:08.798
A cape is just an add-on to a shirt.

15:08.799 --> 15:10.433
But a cloak...

15:11.869 --> 15:13.303
it hugs you.

15:50.141 --> 15:51.808
- I'm sorry.
- No.

15:53.110 --> 15:55.545
The, um...

15:55.546 --> 15:57.914
I am... just, uh...

15:58.883 --> 16:01.918
We will... we'll get back to working

16:01.919 --> 16:04.521
in a minute, just...
just give me a minute, okay?

16:04.522 --> 16:06.256
Okay.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.086
Police at my door?

16:37.087 --> 16:38.855
- My parents would freak out!
- I'm sorry.

16:38.856 --> 16:41.090
But Connors is after you.
You have to lay low.

16:41.091 --> 16:42.659
No, I'm not doing that.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.561
- I'm putting that bastard away.
- Tyrone, please.

16:44.562 --> 16:45.962
I can't do anything else.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.198
Do school, do basketball,
do anything else.

16:48.199 --> 16:49.499
No.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.200
He killed my brother.

16:52.436 --> 16:54.704
Alright? I belong
in this asshole's way.

16:54.705 --> 16:56.139
I'm putting Connors where he belongs.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.440
Yeah, and how are you gonna do that?

16:57.441 --> 16:58.741
I don't know.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.245
- I'm working on it.
- I need you to let me handle it.

17:02.246 --> 17:04.047
I been letting you handle it,
and you ain't done shit.

17:04.048 --> 17:06.215
So, no.

17:06.217 --> 17:08.351
Alright, I'm not stopping. Not today.

17:09.954 --> 17:11.688
Today's the day, isn't it?

17:11.689 --> 17:13.823
The anniversary
of your brother's death.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.759
- You remembered?
- Connors does.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.061
He's been on edge.
Like a special kind of edge.

17:19.997 --> 17:23.132
You think he remembers? Connors?

17:23.133 --> 17:24.666
Yeah, I'd put money on it.

17:26.403 --> 17:27.502
Good.

17:28.439 --> 17:31.808
I'm gonna make sure he never forgets.

17:31.809 --> 17:35.845
4,000 people died from
the Spanish Flu in New Orleans.

17:35.846 --> 17:40.517
Tragically, the virus targeted
the young and the healthy.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.853
But none had more tragic
a tale than Jack Rogers,

17:43.854 --> 17:47.223
who died pulling all of his blood
out in a blood transfusion

17:47.224 --> 17:49.092
to save a dozen patients,

17:49.093 --> 17:50.793
including his lover,

17:50.794 --> 17:53.429
famed Jazz clarinetist, Bobo Smiths.

17:53.430 --> 17:54.764
What's a blood transfusion?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.167
Giving your own for another.

17:58.168 --> 18:01.771
There's no greater
sacrifice than that.

18:01.772 --> 18:06.409
The ghost of Jack Rogers is said
to haunt St. Theresa's church,

18:06.410 --> 18:08.978
playing that old
licorice wand late at night,

18:08.979 --> 18:12.081
hoping to draw Bobo back
for one more song.

18:13.584 --> 18:16.019
You don't need to be afraid of ghosts.

18:16.020 --> 18:17.954
Only spirits looking to settle a score

18:17.955 --> 18:19.789
would harm a person.

18:19.790 --> 18:21.858
Ghosts aren't about abject fear.

18:21.859 --> 18:23.393
They're about justice.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.061
They're here to right a wrong.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.665
Where your mama at?

19:36.774 --> 19:38.307
Sorry, what's this for?

19:38.867 --> 19:41.001
I have a plan to nail Connors.

19:41.002 --> 19:43.003
What are you thinking, Ty?

19:44.272 --> 19:47.908
I'm gonna be Billy. He was my brother.

19:47.909 --> 19:49.376
She told me.

19:49.377 --> 19:50.464
Sorry about what happened.

19:50.477 --> 19:52.346
What do you mean
you're gonna be Billy?

19:52.347 --> 19:55.249
Well, today's the anniversary
of the night Connors shot Billy.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.551
You said it's got him on edge.

19:57.552 --> 19:59.887
I can haunt Connors.

19:59.888 --> 20:01.421
Psych him out.

20:01.422 --> 20:04.358
Make him believe that this kid
he's looking for isn't me,

20:04.359 --> 20:07.961
but the boy he shot eight years ago.

20:07.962 --> 20:10.364
Connors will believe
I was Billy's ghost all along.

20:10.365 --> 20:12.733
Okay, I mean, even if this
didn't sound insane,

20:12.734 --> 20:15.802
- what would it get us?
- A confession.

20:15.803 --> 20:17.871
Not for... for drugs
or for corruption,

20:17.872 --> 20:19.239
we get him for Billy!

20:19.240 --> 20:20.580
We want to help you, Ty, but...

20:21.743 --> 20:24.111
- this isn't a good plan.
- Look, you got a better one?

20:25.680 --> 20:27.414
I'm doing this with or without you.

20:27.415 --> 20:29.683
Even with the sweatshirt
and the resemblance,

20:29.684 --> 20:31.385
and the anniversary,

20:31.386 --> 20:33.153
why would he believe
you're Billy's ghost?

20:33.154 --> 20:34.888
Have neither of you
read "Telltale Heart?"

20:34.889 --> 20:36.723
Yeah, in high school.

20:37.926 --> 20:39.459
Okay, maybe it was
the abridged version.

20:39.460 --> 20:40.827
It's a short story.

20:40.828 --> 20:43.030
You're saying you want
to use his guilt against him.

20:43.031 --> 20:46.266
No, no, no. I'm saying
I want to use his fear.

20:48.436 --> 20:51.572
Look, his whole life is built on lies.

20:51.573 --> 20:54.675
A man like that is... is always
looking over his shoulder.

20:54.676 --> 20:56.443
This time when he looks...

20:57.745 --> 20:59.613
- it'll be Billy.
- No.

20:59.614 --> 21:01.715
No, it's too dangerous.
You're a civilian.

21:01.716 --> 21:03.383
- And a minor.
- But I'm fast.

21:03.384 --> 21:04.518
No one's that fast.

21:09.591 --> 21:11.331
You said he's one
of the good ones, right?

21:13.595 --> 21:15.562
- You did?
- Oh, God.

21:15.563 --> 21:17.664
Look, can I trust him?

21:18.833 --> 21:21.668
You can, but trust him with what?

21:25.006 --> 21:26.707
I can do something.

21:28.943 --> 21:30.210
Something that would sound crazy

21:30.211 --> 21:31.878
unless you see it with your own eyes.

21:43.591 --> 21:46.359
I think with this cloak
I can control it.

22:15.990 --> 22:17.557
Mom?

22:20.194 --> 22:21.662
Mom!

22:21.663 --> 22:23.230
Mom!

22:30.905 --> 22:32.673
911, what's your emergency?

22:32.674 --> 22:34.708
My name is Tandy Bowen.

22:36.010 --> 22:37.711
I need help.

23:54.422 --> 23:56.823
You killed me.

24:14.475 --> 24:17.944
Now, I'm not paying you assholes.

24:28.590 --> 24:29.790
- Got your text.
- Yeah.

24:30.032 --> 24:31.399
Fuchs saw the kid on his beat.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.635
Said this kid matched
the one in your sketch.

24:35.671 --> 24:37.339
This isn't him.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.907
It's the one you had Suzy draw.

24:42.912 --> 24:44.479
Right.

24:45.848 --> 24:47.615
Right, let's go.

24:49.418 --> 24:51.486
Any idea who he is?

24:51.487 --> 24:52.954
Nope.

24:52.955 --> 24:54.422
Seen him around though.

24:54.423 --> 24:56.791
- Oh, where at?
- Around.

24:56.792 --> 24:58.827
I'm sorry I didn't
catch him at the mill.

24:58.828 --> 25:00.228
That kid was fast.

25:00.229 --> 25:03.169
I saw you running, but honestly, it
looked like you were chasing no one.

25:07.236 --> 25:10.238
- What?
- There.

25:11.140 --> 25:12.507
Don't you see him?

25:13.642 --> 25:15.276
No.

25:15.277 --> 25:16.878
He's right there. Don't...

25:21.283 --> 25:23.151
Connors, you feeling okay?

25:28.290 --> 25:30.291
- There!
- I don't see anyone!

25:30.292 --> 25:32.227
Who are we chasing?

26:59.148 --> 27:01.916
- Who are you?
- You know who I am.

27:02.885 --> 27:04.319
You just tried to kill me.

27:05.221 --> 27:06.487
But you can't.

27:07.857 --> 27:09.257
Cause you already did it.

27:10.359 --> 27:12.193
You know what today is?

27:18.534 --> 27:22.237
- You can't be...
- My name is Billy Johnson.

27:24.039 --> 27:25.707
You took me.

27:26.842 --> 27:28.309
You took my life,

27:28.310 --> 27:31.212
and it was a good life too.

27:31.213 --> 27:33.948
- I'm losing it.
- Man, you already lost.

27:33.949 --> 27:36.885
I ain't never gonna
let you be, you hear me?

27:36.886 --> 27:38.953
Not until you admit what you did.

27:38.954 --> 27:40.121
I didn't do anything.

27:40.122 --> 27:42.056
- You're the one...
- I did nothing wrong!

27:42.057 --> 27:45.627
I was scared of you, you and your gun.

27:46.529 --> 27:47.829
It was the explosion.

27:48.898 --> 27:50.632
The rig.

27:50.633 --> 27:53.635
Whole damn thing
blew off, and I... I...

27:54.837 --> 27:56.638
- fired.
- At who?

28:02.311 --> 28:05.613
Why can't you just admit
what you did to my goddamn face?

28:05.614 --> 28:07.115
Huh?

28:08.417 --> 28:11.653
I shot you, okay, kid?

28:11.654 --> 28:14.489
I shot you.

28:14.490 --> 28:16.230
And you cleared
the whole thing up, right?

28:17.760 --> 28:19.294
It happened quick.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.263
My uncle helped me get into Vice.

28:22.264 --> 28:25.166
I... I...

28:25.167 --> 28:27.702
I did what I could.

28:27.703 --> 28:31.039
And I... I couldn't undo it.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.607
It's done.

28:33.676 --> 28:35.209
Okay?

28:37.713 --> 28:40.348
I killed you and buried you.

28:42.284 --> 28:45.653
- You got that right?
- I got it all.

28:45.654 --> 28:47.288
What the hell's going on?

28:48.724 --> 28:50.959
- What is this?
- Detective Connors...

28:50.960 --> 28:53.000
you're under arrest
for the murder of Billy Johnson.

29:04.039 --> 29:06.574
- What do you want?
- For starters?

29:06.575 --> 29:08.977
- Answers.
- To what?

29:08.978 --> 29:10.311
What happened on that rig?

29:10.312 --> 29:11.913
It exploded.

29:11.914 --> 29:13.348
- It happens.
- No.

29:13.349 --> 29:15.350
No, they don't do what that one did.

29:17.219 --> 29:19.153
People didn't just die in the core.

29:20.456 --> 29:22.390
They were infected, right?

29:22.391 --> 29:23.858
I'm sorry.

29:23.859 --> 29:26.394
- "Infected"?
- They lost their mind to terror.

29:27.363 --> 29:29.430
And they panicked
and turned against each other.

29:29.431 --> 29:30.798
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:30.799 --> 29:34.202
You know, my best guess is
when you salvaged that rig...

29:34.203 --> 29:36.170
you guys found Ivan Hess alive,

29:36.171 --> 29:39.173
and the rest of the workers were dead.

29:41.143 --> 29:43.645
And the core infected them
with terror,

29:43.646 --> 29:45.513
and it kept them from escaping,

29:45.514 --> 29:47.982
and it kept them
from keeping each other alive.

29:47.983 --> 29:49.250
That's an evocative story,

29:49.251 --> 29:51.452
but I never saw any evidence of that.

29:51.453 --> 29:54.288
Oh, no worries. I brought you some.

29:58.627 --> 30:00.428
This is a memo.

30:01.363 --> 30:03.364
My dad wrote it.

30:03.365 --> 30:05.967
And he warned Roxxon
that direct human contact

30:05.968 --> 30:09.337
could be dangerous without the
shielding he recommended.

30:09.338 --> 30:12.473
- It's easy enough to fake.
- Not that easy.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.610
But this is just Exhibit
"A" of the meltdown.

30:15.611 --> 30:17.512
The rig didn't melt down, honey.

30:18.614 --> 30:20.948
Here's a piece of the rig, "honey"...

30:20.949 --> 30:23.518
without the heat shielding.

30:23.519 --> 30:25.286
No wonder the whole place blew up.

30:26.355 --> 30:28.656
No one would know what that means.

30:28.657 --> 30:30.458
Oh, Greg did.

30:30.459 --> 30:33.394
But you had him killed
by your water bottle girl.

30:33.395 --> 30:35.530
Destroyed all the evidence.

30:35.531 --> 30:37.165
But you missed a couple things.

30:37.166 --> 30:41.336
And the lies that you
told them again and again?

30:41.337 --> 30:43.471
To the press? My mom?

30:43.472 --> 30:45.473
To Mina and the families
of all those workers?

30:45.474 --> 30:48.176
Maybe the newspapers deserve to know.

30:48.177 --> 30:50.211
What's in your craw, kid?

30:50.212 --> 30:53.514
You and Roxxon destroyed
my father's good name.

30:53.515 --> 30:54.816
"Good name"?

30:56.285 --> 30:58.720
How well did you know
your old man, anyway?

30:58.721 --> 31:01.656
Ignore me. I dare you.

31:01.657 --> 31:02.857
Alright.

31:04.026 --> 31:06.394
What's it gonna take, huh?

31:06.395 --> 31:09.030
Blowing the whistle might seem
like the idealistic thing to do,

31:09.031 --> 31:11.232
but it isn't going to get your mother

31:11.233 --> 31:12.733
out of the trailer park, is it?

31:14.236 --> 31:15.970
I've got money.

31:15.971 --> 31:18.391
Enough socked away to set you
up for the rest of your life.

31:19.575 --> 31:21.275
You just let me...

31:21.276 --> 31:23.110
let me take that evidence
off your hands.

31:24.279 --> 31:26.714
We don't need to involve
the authorities...

31:26.715 --> 31:28.683
or the press.

31:28.684 --> 31:31.018
Now, you just think...

31:31.019 --> 31:33.054
carefully.

31:33.055 --> 31:34.388
What do you want?

31:35.491 --> 31:37.892
Really want?

31:39.628 --> 31:41.762
I want my father back, asshole.

32:01.049 --> 32:04.018
- Video's in evidence.
- Locked and logged.

32:04.987 --> 32:06.387
You saw that kid.

32:07.556 --> 32:09.557
I mean, what he can do.

32:09.558 --> 32:11.626
I'm from New York.
I've seen it before.

32:13.429 --> 32:15.196
I ever tell you
about my friend, Misty?

32:16.231 --> 32:19.033
- No.
- I'll tell you about her later.

32:22.571 --> 32:23.838
Pancakes tomorrow?

32:31.079 --> 32:32.613
And what about the day after?

32:34.116 --> 32:35.850
I can do that too.

32:35.851 --> 32:37.685
And the, uh, day after that?

33:02.316 --> 33:05.017
When I got a confession
out of him, it was...

33:05.018 --> 33:06.685
it was like music.

33:08.488 --> 33:12.391
It was real and awful and sweet.

33:15.662 --> 33:17.196
I didn't get a confession.

33:19.199 --> 33:20.833
But I did scare the shit out of him.

33:22.235 --> 33:23.669
Blowing the whistle on these assholes

33:23.670 --> 33:26.005
and putting Roxxon out of business.

33:26.006 --> 33:28.674
These past eight years
have sucked, but...

33:28.675 --> 33:30.276
maybe we do have a future.

33:32.079 --> 33:33.646
Maybe we do.

33:41.688 --> 33:43.422
I'm glad you came.

33:44.825 --> 33:47.226
Mom, this is Tyrone.

33:47.227 --> 33:48.928
His brother died the same night.

33:49.863 --> 33:51.630
We got to be friends, so...

33:52.532 --> 33:55.568
- Ma'am.
- I'm so sorry for your loss,

33:55.569 --> 33:57.903
but I'm glad you could join us.

33:57.904 --> 33:59.138
Yeah, thanks for having me.

33:59.139 --> 34:01.874
Hey, I brought this lantern.

34:04.277 --> 34:07.213
- Thought it'd be a nice change.
- Let me find my lighter.

34:10.050 --> 34:12.150
Are you dying to tell her?

34:12.152 --> 34:14.053
When the papers come out, she'll know.

34:15.822 --> 34:17.356
She'll know it'll be alright.

34:17.357 --> 34:19.725
You're not gonna miss that money?

34:19.726 --> 34:21.527
It's not about the money.

34:22.596 --> 34:24.830
It's about Dad getting
his good name back.

34:26.233 --> 34:28.434
- Here we go.
- I got it.

34:31.905 --> 34:33.706
Uh...

34:33.706 --> 34:36.308
Tyrone, would you like
to say a few words?

34:36.309 --> 34:37.743
About your brother?

34:38.645 --> 34:40.413
Um...

34:40.414 --> 34:42.081
Maybe a moment of silence?

34:43.049 --> 34:45.317
Then the lantern?

34:45.318 --> 34:47.186
Okay.

34:57.030 --> 34:58.664
What is that?

34:58.665 --> 35:00.032
It's my old front door.

35:25.592 --> 35:27.493
Is this a fear?

35:49.483 --> 35:51.083
Or a memory?

35:52.252 --> 35:53.486
I think it's both.

38:44.758 --> 38:46.992
Don't rely on anyone, Tandy.

38:48.294 --> 38:49.928
You hear me?

38:52.432 --> 38:53.799
When it comes down to it...

38:54.734 --> 38:56.235
we're all on our own.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.554
Peter Scarborough.

39:15.555 --> 39:16.955
It's Tandy Bowen.

39:18.158 --> 39:20.392
I thought about it, and you know what?

39:22.562 --> 39:24.430
I'll take the money.

39:24.431 --> 39:25.971
I'm happy...

39:29.436 --> 39:30.869
It's safe here.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.064
- And you know it.
- I can't stay here.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.461
What are you talking about?

39:33.473 --> 39:35.340
I don't feel safe here!

39:36.309 --> 39:38.544
Not anymore!

39:38.545 --> 39:42.014
I'm scared, Otis. I can't.

40:58.691 --> 40:59.958
Fuchs!

41:01.261 --> 41:02.594
Hey, get up!

41:03.763 --> 41:05.898
I want celebration pancakes!

41:10.003 --> 41:12.638
Oh! You're making a feast this time.
