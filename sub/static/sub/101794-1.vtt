WEBVTT

04:42.714 --> 04:45.517
Hey babe, how'd it go?

04:49.788 --> 04:52.959
- It was okay.
- I'm glad to hear that.

04:56.995 --> 05:00.964
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm gonna shower.

05:00.966 --> 05:04.670
Well hurry up, I'm
making dinner, so...

05:23.088 --> 05:24.891
Are we gonna talk about it?

05:27.259 --> 05:29.262
What do you want
me to say, Christian?

05:34.901 --> 05:36.834
You can at least try.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.806
You've never been this
distant before, I...

05:41.807 --> 05:45.745
I don't know what we're
doing here, honestly.

05:47.245 --> 05:51.616
Things were going
so great for us.

05:55.053 --> 05:56.722
Do you wanna throw
all that away?

06:00.392 --> 06:05.330
Huh?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.090
Stop, Jesus!

07:10.362 --> 07:11.661
You should know
that I haven't had sex

07:11.663 --> 07:13.365
with anyone since you were gone.

07:16.735 --> 07:18.538
Is that supposed
to mean anything?

07:22.774 --> 07:27.579
If we were so close, where
were you this past year, huh?

07:33.151 --> 07:35.221
I don't even know
you anymore, Robert.

07:38.089 --> 07:39.257
My point exactly.

09:00.639 --> 09:01.774
Robert, I missed you!

09:05.677 --> 09:07.178
- Uh-oh.
- It's fine.

09:09.148 --> 09:12.418
Just so much stuff to take in.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.622
How's life, how's everything?

09:18.624 --> 09:20.793
- So much to catch up about.
- I know.

09:23.629 --> 09:25.730
I'm just trying to
stay focused basically.

09:30.101 --> 09:31.670
Are you still seeing that guy?

09:33.105 --> 09:36.341
I remember you were seeing
someone, Josh something?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.142
John?

09:39.144 --> 09:40.211
Yeah, we broke up.

09:42.881 --> 09:45.583
That was like two
years ago, Robert.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.552
Oh I'm sorry.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.023
I'm having trouble
collecting thoughts.

09:54.025 --> 09:57.929
- How are you, anyway?
- I've had better days.

09:59.398 --> 10:02.668
I'm sorry, Rob.
How's Christian doing?

10:03.970 --> 10:07.537
- So you know him too?
- Of course!

10:07.539 --> 10:11.376
You guys were great together.
He did a lot for you.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.411
He left early this morning

10:15.413 --> 10:17.149
and I don't think
he's coming back.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.619
And I don't even know if
I'm supposed to feel bad.

10:22.554 --> 10:23.655
It's tough.

10:26.192 --> 10:28.793
I just keep recalling
that night over and over.

10:31.429 --> 10:32.664
I was reckless, wasn't I?

10:35.368 --> 10:38.903
- You're starting to remember.
- Just bits and pieces really.

10:43.274 --> 10:46.576
Well, don't be too
hard on yourself.

10:46.578 --> 10:48.647
- It wasn't your fault.
- No, I know.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.286
You went through
something very traumatic.

10:55.754 --> 10:58.691
It's in the past, there's
nothing you can do about it.

10:59.924 --> 11:01.126
Are you sure about that?

11:02.293 --> 11:05.362
What do you want
to do about it?

11:05.364 --> 11:07.466
What can you do about it?

11:08.366 --> 11:10.533
I don't know, nothing.

11:20.111 --> 11:23.381
I guess the past is
past, you're right.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.309
What an asshole!

13:40.418 --> 13:41.220
Robert!

13:44.255 --> 13:45.924
Are you going to
fucking look at me?

13:48.126 --> 13:48.927
Hi.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.094
You followed me?

13:52.096 --> 13:54.531
Yeah, I thought
you didn't see me.

13:54.533 --> 13:56.568
Listen, I'm sorry
about the other night.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.103
Do we know each other?

14:00.105 --> 14:02.004
I'm gonna blow you until
you explode in my mouth?

14:02.006 --> 14:05.408
- Okay! Okay.
- So you do remember.

14:05.410 --> 14:10.113
And listen, I can be
quite temperamental.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.851
- This is so embarrassing.
- I can imagine!

14:14.820 --> 14:17.253
I shouldn't have indulged
in that conversation,

14:17.255 --> 14:19.890
as much as enjoyed
fantasizing about it.

14:19.892 --> 14:23.093
So I'm the one who
should be sorry.

14:23.095 --> 14:24.629
I fantasize about
it all the time!

14:25.697 --> 14:27.897
- I have to go.
- Wait, hey!

14:27.899 --> 14:30.970
Let me make it up to you.
Let me make you mine.

14:33.304 --> 14:36.607
All right listen what can
I do, can we start over?

14:36.609 --> 14:37.442
Yeah, I'd like that.

14:38.376 --> 14:39.709
All right, why don't you come

14:39.711 --> 14:42.345
to my place tonight for dinner?

14:42.347 --> 14:44.082
For dinner?

14:45.250 --> 14:48.986
Yeah, maybe you can
show me that trick.

14:48.988 --> 14:52.388
How about we hang
out and allow me

14:52.390 --> 14:54.190
to prove to you
how I'm not a slut.

14:54.192 --> 14:57.728
So you're not gonna do the
things you said you would?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.762
You're pretty
conflicted, you know that.

14:59.764 --> 15:02.533
Okay, come over.

15:05.336 --> 15:07.470
If this is going to
work, we are gonna need

15:07.472 --> 15:10.208
- to make an effort.
- We'll manage.

15:12.677 --> 15:15.112
One more thing.

15:50.249 --> 15:53.749
- I've met someone.
- Really?

15:53.751 --> 15:55.420
Is that why you've
been so quiet?

15:56.388 --> 15:57.221
That's great!

15:59.524 --> 16:01.059
You don't think it's too soon?

16:02.528 --> 16:06.696
Not at all. If anything, I
just feel bad for Christian.

16:06.698 --> 16:07.598
Have you told him?

16:10.836 --> 16:12.604
Just try not getting
too attached.

16:14.005 --> 16:15.604
You have a tendency to do that.

16:15.606 --> 16:18.476
Yeah it's just...
It's just a date.

16:20.078 --> 16:22.714
That's good. How'd you meet?

16:26.585 --> 16:28.050
Oh my God, Robert!

16:28.052 --> 16:29.486
How am I supposed
to meet guys?

16:29.488 --> 16:31.821
- You've done it yourself!
- Remember what happened

16:31.823 --> 16:33.857
the last time you met
someone through an app?

16:33.859 --> 16:38.864
Kate, please! This is
hard enough as it is.

16:39.597 --> 16:40.431
I know.

16:45.803 --> 16:49.772
I ran into him earlier
today and he seems very nice.

16:49.774 --> 16:52.510
- We're having dinner tonight.
- Well...

16:53.846 --> 16:55.346
I'm happy for you.

17:52.938 --> 17:53.872
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.778
My name's Hugo.
It's nice to meet you.

18:04.883 --> 18:06.085
I'm a hopeless romantic.

18:16.929 --> 18:21.934
- You're quite a talker.
- I'd rather not say.

18:31.609 --> 18:34.844
Well the texts you sent
me weren't shy at all.

18:34.846 --> 18:36.147
What happened to that guy?

18:38.116 --> 18:40.652
He stayed home for the night.

18:43.888 --> 18:46.690
I haven't been on a date
in a really long time.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.026
Then I guess I got lucky.

18:50.362 --> 18:55.367
- Are you really into me?
- Why would you ask that?

18:56.434 --> 18:57.635
Just curious, I guess.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.038
I'm really happy you're here.

19:02.173 --> 19:03.307
Me too, yeah.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.146
Are you gonna drink?

19:12.017 --> 19:13.519
No, thank you.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.024
Okay.

19:28.366 --> 19:31.301
You don't actually
think a romantic dinner

19:31.303 --> 19:33.103
is gonna suffice
for me to get down

19:33.105 --> 19:36.105
on my knees and suck
you off, do you?

19:38.277 --> 19:41.510
Am I even your
type or is it just

19:41.512 --> 19:43.712
because of the sexual
things I wrote?

19:43.714 --> 19:46.817
Jesus, of course
you're my type.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.587
You need to give
yourself more credit.

19:52.990 --> 19:57.996
When you're finished here,
I have a surprise for you.

20:08.539 --> 20:10.306
How the fuck are you
gonna do the things

20:10.308 --> 20:12.810
you said you would when
you can't even look at me?

20:14.579 --> 20:15.580
Haven't you heard?

20:17.915 --> 20:19.350
Shy guys are the best in bed.

20:22.453 --> 20:24.386
We're just two adults
bathing together.

20:24.388 --> 20:26.555
There's nothing wrong with that.

20:26.557 --> 20:30.660
Your confidence is so sexy.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.763
I can't wait to kiss
those lips of yours.

20:33.765 --> 20:37.736
God, those fuckin' lips.

20:39.203 --> 20:42.138
I'm so ready to have them
wrapped around my cock.

20:44.175 --> 20:47.211
Shy? Am I turning you on?

20:52.416 --> 20:54.086
You wouldn't lie
to me, would you?

20:57.855 --> 21:00.125
I can see your cock
through the water.

21:04.328 --> 21:07.432
All right, no sex tonight.

21:09.867 --> 21:10.735
Close your eyes.

21:12.471 --> 21:13.305
Why?

21:14.605 --> 21:17.007
Just fucking close
your eyes, stupid.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.111
You're a savage!

21:26.785 --> 21:30.055
I can't wait
to make you mine.

21:38.329 --> 21:41.232
Fuck!

21:52.711 --> 21:54.009
And when someone's
really intimidating,

21:54.011 --> 21:56.514
- you like them more, you know?
- Absolutely.

21:57.816 --> 22:00.352
He's just perfect.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.854
I just, I can't believe
you've not had sex yet!

22:05.856 --> 22:08.857
Really? Is that all you
get from everything I said?

22:08.859 --> 22:10.626
Well I don't think I've
ever stayed the night

22:10.628 --> 22:11.762
without a little play.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.333
Now that you mention it,
I don't think I have either.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.603
You're even shocking yourself.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.507
Well the sexual tension
between the two of you,

22:23.674 --> 22:25.240
don't get stuck in
the friend zone!

22:25.242 --> 22:27.076
Well I'm not
worried about that.

22:27.078 --> 22:29.280
He wants those around his.

22:30.281 --> 22:32.481
Blue balls aren't cool!

22:32.483 --> 22:34.383
You can't say stuff
like that to him

22:34.385 --> 22:36.853
- unless you're having sex!
- He said that, not me.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.521
- I mean...
- You are drooling

22:39.523 --> 22:41.125
all over this guy already!

22:43.161 --> 22:46.161
You want him all to yourself.
When did you get so greedy?

22:46.163 --> 22:46.998
Shut up!

22:50.535 --> 22:54.740
- What about Christian?
- What about him?

22:57.041 --> 23:00.244
He's having a
really hard time.

23:01.313 --> 23:02.948
You guys talk?

23:04.415 --> 23:09.153
- He's out of the picture.
- You sure?

23:10.255 --> 23:11.089
Mm-hmm.

23:12.457 --> 23:15.290
I remember you
used to brag about

23:15.292 --> 23:17.261
how good the sex
was between you two.

23:18.829 --> 23:20.831
That type of chemistry's
hard to find,

23:21.967 --> 23:22.899
not to mention how much
he cares about you!

23:22.901 --> 23:24.035
Oh I think I've found it.

23:26.505 --> 23:30.840
Anyway, I've gotta go.
Some of us have work.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.177
Thanks for breakfast.

23:33.310 --> 23:35.745
Hey, do you wanna hang
out later tonight?

23:35.747 --> 23:40.752
- I can't, we have plans.
- We? Two nights in a row?

23:42.053 --> 23:44.421
Tomorrow night,
and we might go raw.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.757
Wow.

23:47.425 --> 23:48.759
- Bye Frank.
- Have fun!

24:10.214 --> 24:12.082
Hey, yeah I just left his.

24:13.518 --> 24:17.420
Yeah, he's fine, but
he's really obsessing

24:17.422 --> 24:22.427
over this new guy. yeah, he
won't stop talking about him.

24:26.464 --> 24:31.366
No, this time it's different.

24:31.368 --> 24:35.740
Yeah, me too. All
right, see you.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.414
- So, where were you?
- What do you mean?

25:18.884 --> 25:21.584
I've been waiting
for you my whole life.

25:21.586 --> 25:25.321
- I think I'm falling for you.
- You're falling for me?

25:25.323 --> 25:27.824
On what, our second
date?

25:27.826 --> 25:31.628
- Such a cliche.
- No, stupid.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.729
I think I'm falling
in love with you.

25:33.731 --> 25:38.435
Oh God, no.
Are you sure you're gay?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.403
It's like you're
saying the exact things

25:41.405 --> 25:43.139
a girl would like
to hear from a guy

25:43.141 --> 25:46.978
but somehow, it's working.

25:48.413 --> 25:52.384
- You don't believe my word?
- Why, should I?

25:54.419 --> 25:57.288
Let's go to my place
and I'll show you.

26:06.530 --> 26:11.167
- What are you doing?
- Undressing you.

26:11.169 --> 26:14.239
- You should stop.
- I wanna make love to you.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.875
- We said we'd wait.
- You said we'd wait.

26:19.877 --> 26:23.981
I didn't. Just say you want
it, just fucking say it!

26:24.915 --> 26:26.083
No, please!

26:27.251 --> 26:29.053
Relax, you're not
a slut, I get it.

26:30.555 --> 26:33.523
Your body's shuddering.
Let it decide for itself.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.058
- No, no Hugo!
- I know exactly

26:36.060 --> 26:37.561
when no means yes.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.841
Lie back now.

26:51.843 --> 26:54.142
Wait, put a rubber on.

27:54.071 --> 27:56.605
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

27:56.607 --> 27:58.209
I was just checking something.

27:59.376 --> 28:00.308
One fuck does not
give you the right

28:00.310 --> 28:01.276
to go around my apartment.

28:01.278 --> 28:03.048
- What's wrong?
- Out, now!

28:04.715 --> 28:06.350
Will you call me?

28:08.486 --> 28:10.186
You got what you wanted

28:10.188 --> 28:12.354
and now you're kicking me out?

29:27.198 --> 29:28.998
I just don't know
what to make of it!

29:29.000 --> 29:32.834
I wouldn't either,
such strange behavior.

29:32.836 --> 29:35.272
It was so unexpected
but so great.

29:36.740 --> 29:39.475
I haven't felt this way in
a really long time, Kate.

29:39.477 --> 29:44.080
- Ever since, you know.
- Perhaps he's scared?

29:44.082 --> 29:47.549
- Is he openly gay?
- I don't know.

29:47.551 --> 29:51.319
Maybe he's just
not and the thought

29:51.321 --> 29:53.257
of falling in love
with a guy is too much

29:54.424 --> 29:56.292
- to handle.
- Maybe.

29:56.294 --> 29:57.893
I don't know much
about gay dating

29:57.895 --> 29:59.295
or dating in general
for that matter,

29:59.297 --> 30:02.100
- but he sounds crazy to me.
- I know, I know.

30:06.237 --> 30:08.239
Do you even wanna see
him again after this?

30:09.273 --> 30:10.640
Oh hon.

30:13.010 --> 30:13.845
I'm sorry.

30:17.714 --> 30:20.050
You just can't trust anyone.

30:21.685 --> 30:23.453
It's my fault for giving in.

30:24.923 --> 30:27.090
Sex makes me fall in
love and I know that.

30:28.893 --> 30:32.460
He wore me out, Kate,
in a really good way.

30:32.462 --> 30:35.567
And now I feel needy and I
hate that feeling, I hate it!

30:37.999 --> 30:40.169
Sounds so
frustrating, but look,

30:40.171 --> 30:43.575
whatever happens,
you had a great time.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.077
- The sex was amazing, right?
- Yeah.

30:48.479 --> 30:50.882
So as long as it was
safe, what's there to lose?

30:53.951 --> 30:55.551
You played it safe, right?

30:55.553 --> 30:58.723
Yeah, I never have
unprotected sex.

30:59.923 --> 31:01.859
Good, then it's
okay. Let it be?

31:03.027 --> 31:03.862
Yeah.

31:06.631 --> 31:11.636
- You don't seem convinced.
- Actually, that's not all.

31:12.403 --> 31:13.971
What do you mean?

31:19.810 --> 31:24.081
- What's this?
- Have you seen it before?

31:25.516 --> 31:29.218
- Where did you get this?
- Found it this morning.

31:29.220 --> 31:30.954
Someone slipped it
through my door.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.291
Don't look at me that way!

31:34.659 --> 31:36.424
If I have something to
say, I say it to your face.

31:36.426 --> 31:39.296
- I'm your friend!
- I know, I'm sorry.

31:43.067 --> 31:46.904
- Are you okay, Rob?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.209
You wouldn't talk to Christian
about this, would you?

31:52.442 --> 31:55.344
- Never.
- Okay.

32:33.617 --> 32:35.352
I've been waiting
for you my whole life.

32:38.588 --> 32:40.023
I'm falling in love with you!

33:24.669 --> 33:26.869
Bank of
America, Jessica speaking.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.437
- How may I help you?
- Yeah, hi.

33:28.439 --> 33:30.538
There seems to be some sort
of problem with my trust fund.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.641
Basically I'm trying to
transfer $1.5 million

33:32.643 --> 33:36.578
from my American account
to my Hungarian one.

33:36.580 --> 33:39.016
Yes sir, let
me pull up your details.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.517
For such large transactions,
we usually need you

33:42.519 --> 33:45.888
to come into the branch, but I
can check with my supervisor.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.323
Could
you please look into that?

33:47.325 --> 33:49.691
I'm really trying to
repurchase an apartment

33:49.693 --> 33:52.128
- that I used to own.
- Yes sir.

33:52.130 --> 33:53.595
We will contact you
as soon as possible.

33:53.597 --> 33:56.134
- Thank you very much.
- Have a great day sir.

34:26.463 --> 34:27.297
Christian?

34:40.911 --> 34:43.045
I'm so sorry to
bother you Kate.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.514
It's no bother
at all, you know that.

34:45.516 --> 34:48.286
I'm really worried about him.

34:49.753 --> 34:53.757
- He hasn't even called!
- Oh, Christian.

34:56.494 --> 34:58.961
I've waited for
him for a year.

34:58.963 --> 35:00.665
He's the one, I know it.

35:05.702 --> 35:08.271
Do you know that we're married?

35:10.574 --> 35:12.976
What are you talking about?

35:15.980 --> 35:17.780
A few days after
the secret wedding,

35:17.782 --> 35:20.785
I said something to him
that made him really angry.

35:23.286 --> 35:24.954
So angry that he
wanted to hurt me

35:24.956 --> 35:27.091
but instead, someone hurt him.

35:28.425 --> 35:29.492
This is such an
uncomfortable position

35:29.494 --> 35:32.262
for me to be in, oh my God.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.533
Do you know
something that I don't?

35:41.204 --> 35:45.775
Please, Kate, I deserve to know!

35:47.378 --> 35:49.914
I... I couldn't possibly.

35:51.382 --> 35:56.320
Please Kate, please please
please please!

35:57.288 --> 36:00.590
- He's seeing someone.
- What?

36:02.226 --> 36:07.231
No, no no. But he
just came back!

36:09.567 --> 36:14.572
Listen, Christian, Robert was
severely injured that night.

36:15.972 --> 36:18.407
I don't think he realizes
what you did for him,

36:18.409 --> 36:20.642
how you took him out
of that shithole,

36:20.644 --> 36:22.780
doing all that nasty
business he was doing.

36:23.981 --> 36:27.652
- He's not even aware of that.
- Maybe.

36:28.552 --> 36:29.953
Maybe I should remind him.

36:32.056 --> 36:33.289
It might bring his memory back.

36:33.291 --> 36:38.296
No, no. In his
own time, trust me.

36:43.867 --> 36:47.538
- Hey handsome, come here.
- Hi.

36:49.673 --> 36:54.510
What took you so
long, are you okay?

36:54.512 --> 36:59.014
- I got lost.
- Well, that's okay.

36:59.016 --> 37:00.583
The next time you're
running behind,

37:00.585 --> 37:02.985
let me know and
I'll call you a cab.

37:02.987 --> 37:06.224
I didn't realize I was
late. Are we going somewhere?

37:07.757 --> 37:10.460
No, no I just had to see you.

37:14.664 --> 37:18.266
I'm sorry, it's only
because my feelings

37:18.268 --> 37:19.402
for you are so strong.

37:20.570 --> 37:24.373
That kind of thing
has never happened.

37:24.375 --> 37:29.278
Well, I'm all yours,
so you should treat me

37:29.280 --> 37:30.781
with more dignity and respect.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.017
I take it day by day.

37:34.918 --> 37:38.489
Listen there's something
I've been thinking about,

37:41.025 --> 37:46.030
- all day long.
- What's that?

37:57.041 --> 37:59.844
Oh fuck, I'm so glad
you're not just a bottom.

38:00.878 --> 38:04.448
Shut up!

38:10.420 --> 38:13.657
Every time we make love,
I feel closer to you.

38:15.326 --> 38:18.262
- Is that normal?
- It's a good thing.

38:20.864 --> 38:22.265
But it's scary.

38:23.934 --> 38:26.370
It feels like a
drug, doesn't it?

38:34.545 --> 38:39.280
And listen, I really enjoy
our time together, Robert.

38:39.282 --> 38:40.418
I feel the same way.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.423
But we've gotta be
discrete about this.

38:48.425 --> 38:52.295
- Is that okay?
- I can do that.

38:56.266 --> 39:01.204
Come here.

39:05.009 --> 39:10.014
Here, now listen, I have
a cabin in the woods.

39:11.215 --> 39:13.648
It's nothing fancy
but it's private,

39:13.650 --> 39:18.655
- romantic and secluded.
- That sounds awesome.

39:20.056 --> 39:22.257
I have a few days off. Why
don't you join me this weekend?

39:22.259 --> 39:24.994
All right, and we can get
up close and personal.

39:25.996 --> 39:28.065
That sounds very romantic.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.869
I feel like I
know you already.

39:33.269 --> 39:36.771
Just come with me, just say yes!

39:36.773 --> 39:41.778
- Oh Hugo, I don't know.
- Come on, it'll be fun!

39:43.981 --> 39:48.483
Maybe in a few
weeks, if things work.

39:48.485 --> 39:50.453
If things work?

39:53.157 --> 39:56.057
You were just inside
me an hour ago!

39:56.059 --> 39:57.293
You know what I mean.

39:58.695 --> 40:01.364
We've known each
other for a minute.

40:03.032 --> 40:05.603
This is going so
fast, it's too soon!

40:07.271 --> 40:09.807
Well it certainly
wasn't too soon before

40:10.708 --> 40:12.143
when you were pounding away!

40:17.081 --> 40:19.717
Every time we make love
I feel closer to you.

40:21.217 --> 40:24.186
Why are you so
upset all of a sudden?

40:24.188 --> 40:27.590
If there's one thing
you need to know about me,

40:28.559 --> 40:29.994
it's that I hate lies.

40:31.896 --> 40:36.901
If you ever lie to
me, or betray me-

40:38.101 --> 40:40.735
- That wouldn't happen,
calm down! Calm down!

40:40.737 --> 40:44.072
Hey things will
have consequences.

40:49.112 --> 40:51.548
I didn't lie, I
like being with you.

40:53.751 --> 40:54.552
Hey.

40:56.686 --> 40:58.054
I love you, Robert.

41:00.090 --> 41:03.193
I fuckin' love you! Don't
you feel the same way?

41:07.898 --> 41:09.600
Just fucking come
with me, stupid.

41:10.934 --> 41:14.904
- Okay, let's fucking do it.
- Good boy.

41:18.675 --> 41:22.011
I fucked Hugo the
other night. It was hot.

41:22.913 --> 41:25.847
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sorry.

41:25.849 --> 41:29.319
It's just that
Christian never let me.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.653
You're starting to remember?

41:32.655 --> 41:35.458
That, Kate, I'd never forget.

41:37.460 --> 41:41.498
Good, that's good I guess.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.833
I'm not sure I
should say this.

41:44.835 --> 41:47.336
- Say what?
- I'm living with Hugo

41:47.338 --> 41:49.173
for a weekend
retreat at his cabin.

41:50.139 --> 41:52.307
- What?
- He invited me.

41:52.309 --> 41:55.142
- I couldn't say no.
- Do you wanna go?

41:55.144 --> 41:57.748
Yes, I can't stop
thinking about it.

41:59.083 --> 42:01.249
Isn't it too soon,
considering you just got back

42:01.251 --> 42:04.586
- from rehab?
- Is that what this is about?

42:04.588 --> 42:08.423
Rehab? Kate, let's be
real, we're adults.

42:08.425 --> 42:11.092
What am I supposed to
do? I really like him!

42:11.094 --> 42:15.429
This guy is weird.
How do you trust him?

42:15.431 --> 42:18.200
- I don't wanna screw up.
- So you're willing

42:18.202 --> 42:20.538
to do as he pleases?

42:22.505 --> 42:24.805
You can't just go away
with some random guy

42:24.807 --> 42:27.878
- who tells you he loves you!
- Yes I can, and I will!

42:29.012 --> 42:32.481
You're having sex.
That's not love.

42:32.483 --> 42:34.282
Are you telling me that
what I feel isn't real?

42:34.284 --> 42:36.318
Are we discussing what I feel?

42:36.320 --> 42:39.688
He doesn't seem stable.
You barely know him!

42:39.690 --> 42:42.124
Does that sound normal to you?

42:42.126 --> 42:45.663
So concerned
all of a sudden.

42:47.297 --> 42:48.798
Where were you this past year?

42:51.768 --> 42:53.403
You're not reading the signs.

42:59.443 --> 43:03.480
I feel that you push me away
the minute you meet a guy.

43:05.382 --> 43:06.383
What's the rush?

43:08.251 --> 43:11.087
I miss that feeling
of inebriation, Kate.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.356
When you no longer
recognize who you are

43:14.358 --> 43:18.362
because the confident version
of yourself takes over.

43:19.329 --> 43:21.998
You can practically do anything.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.369
Have you ever experienced that?

43:26.536 --> 43:30.505
- I'm worried about you.
- When I was in rehab,

43:30.507 --> 43:33.474
my therapist said
something that I just,

43:33.476 --> 43:37.079
I can't get out of my head.

43:37.081 --> 43:40.282
You know I was
adopted at 15, right?

43:40.284 --> 43:43.050
Well, I like to feel vulnerable.

43:43.052 --> 43:46.789
I like danger because it
reminds me of my childhood.

43:49.025 --> 43:50.791
Which sounds so cliche,

43:50.793 --> 43:55.798
but don't be so surprised
about my taste in men.

44:03.606 --> 44:05.309
I just want you to be careful.

44:06.610 --> 44:09.010
I feel like you're
putting yourself

44:09.012 --> 44:10.114
in a very dangerous position.

44:11.514 --> 44:14.615
He keeps me happy
and distracted,

44:14.617 --> 44:17.351
and that's better than
any of my other options.

44:17.353 --> 44:19.056
I think you're
making a mistake.

44:20.456 --> 44:24.892
Christian cares about
you. He loves you!

44:24.894 --> 44:28.132
You should concentrate on that.

44:31.902 --> 44:34.672
You might wanna talk
to your therapist.

44:46.016 --> 44:48.617
- Hi Doctor.
- Oh, hi.

44:48.619 --> 44:51.552
What happened? You're not
scheduled until next week are you?

44:51.554 --> 44:54.190
- It'll be a minute.
- Well?

44:55.793 --> 45:00.628
- I've met someone.
- And who is he?

45:00.630 --> 45:04.800
He is everything
I've ever wanted.

45:04.802 --> 45:07.869
He's handsome, he's
smart, and he loves me.

45:07.871 --> 45:10.271
I've been waiting
for him all my life.

45:10.273 --> 45:11.607
That's wonderful, Robert.

45:12.710 --> 45:13.909
Why don't we discuss
it next week?

45:13.911 --> 45:15.342
Actually, I only
came here to tell you

45:15.344 --> 45:17.113
that I won't be coming again.

45:19.550 --> 45:22.483
What, you want to
stop your treatment?

45:22.485 --> 45:24.952
- Mm-hmm.
- Robert that's-

45:24.954 --> 45:26.153
- Don't try to
rationalize things

45:26.155 --> 45:27.688
because I've already
made up my mind.

45:27.690 --> 45:29.423
Not to mention, my friends
have grilled me about it.

45:29.425 --> 45:31.327
So I really don't
wanna hear it again.

45:32.496 --> 45:35.329
So your friends think
it's not a good idea?

45:35.331 --> 45:37.768
It doesn't matter
what anyone thinks!

45:40.369 --> 45:41.871
How long have you known him?

45:44.942 --> 45:47.842
Are we back there again, Robert?

45:47.844 --> 45:49.645
We've gone through
this, haven't we?

45:51.914 --> 45:54.215
You've seen me
a couple of times

45:54.217 --> 45:55.184
and you think you
already know me?

45:57.387 --> 45:59.289
I have your reports
from California.

46:00.456 --> 46:03.691
Listen, I've gone
as far as I've wanted

46:03.693 --> 46:07.162
to go and I'm really
good, so there's no point

46:07.164 --> 46:09.430
- in coming here again.
- Robert, what are you going

46:09.432 --> 46:10.965
to do when you
recover your memory?

46:10.967 --> 46:12.536
Or if you don't?

46:13.936 --> 46:16.403
You're not going to be
able to handle this alone.

46:16.405 --> 46:18.375
I'll take my chances.

46:32.155 --> 46:34.322
- Hello?
- Hey.

46:34.324 --> 46:38.526
Come up.

46:38.528 --> 46:39.362
What's up?

46:45.668 --> 46:49.373
- Not much, you?
- Just packing.

46:50.907 --> 46:52.275
Right.

46:54.610 --> 46:59.615
God, this is awkward,
I'm actually here for an intervention.

47:01.150 --> 47:03.719
- What?
- Kate called.

47:05.956 --> 47:07.557
You also think I shouldn't go.

47:08.958 --> 47:12.428
- Where? With Hugo?
- Yeah.

47:13.597 --> 47:15.265
I don't know, I
guess it's fine.

47:19.135 --> 47:22.604
Kate and I, we had
a pretty serious talk.

47:22.606 --> 47:25.642
So I'm not sure why you're here.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.376
You having drinking thoughts?

47:29.378 --> 47:31.679
She shouldn't
have told you that.

47:31.681 --> 47:35.249
I feel really guilty,
Robert, and shitty.

47:35.251 --> 47:37.351
- Why?
- Well,

47:37.353 --> 47:39.253
we used to go out a lot.

47:39.255 --> 47:41.623
- You followed me around.
- Don't go there.

47:41.625 --> 47:43.758
You know that had
nothing to do with it.

47:43.760 --> 47:44.595
But still.

47:46.996 --> 47:48.896
Life is complex, Frank.

47:48.898 --> 47:51.099
I didn't have an easy childhood.

47:51.101 --> 47:53.871
And I take full responsibility
for my mistakes.

47:56.172 --> 47:58.107
I just hope that...

47:59.443 --> 48:01.111
I just hope that
you work it out.

48:02.512 --> 48:04.679
- And don't be mad at Kate.
- God, no.

48:04.681 --> 48:08.284
- I love her, you know that.
- Good.

48:10.420 --> 48:13.389
- I'm gonna use your bathroom.
- Okay.

48:39.916 --> 48:43.150
- So, when are you leaving?
- Today.

48:43.152 --> 48:47.523
- Already? That's sudden.
- This is real.

48:48.458 --> 48:49.992
This is real.

48:51.394 --> 48:52.695
- You wanna drink?
- Yeah.

48:57.333 --> 49:00.236
- So are you excited?
- I am.

49:01.804 --> 49:04.373
And a little nervous,
to be honest.

49:09.045 --> 49:12.682
But it's just a
long weekend, so.

49:13.717 --> 49:18.286
Okay.

49:18.288 --> 49:19.253
Do you wanna leave
me the address,

49:19.255 --> 49:20.456
- just in case?
- It's fine.

49:21.724 --> 49:24.961
- So where is he taking you?
- I don't know.

49:25.862 --> 49:29.566
- Far, I hope.
- How far?

49:30.766 --> 49:34.436
Why? You think it's dangerous?

49:34.438 --> 49:36.373
No, I think it's
irresponsible.

49:38.108 --> 49:40.143
He's gonna rock my world.

49:42.512 --> 49:44.612
Look, I know what it's like

49:44.614 --> 49:46.313
when you first start
seeing someone.

49:46.315 --> 49:49.218
Believe me, I have my
fair share of experiences.

49:50.487 --> 49:53.588
I just, I want
you to be careful.

49:53.590 --> 49:55.292
Don't want you
getting hurt again.

49:56.393 --> 49:58.061
I can take care of myself.

50:00.597 --> 50:03.097
I'm gonna be Frank.

50:03.099 --> 50:04.532
- No pun intended.
- Right.

50:04.534 --> 50:06.800
We think you might be
replacing one addiction

50:06.802 --> 50:10.505
- with another.
- We?

50:10.507 --> 50:13.074
When did I become the
center of the conversation?

50:13.076 --> 50:15.045
And why can't you
just be happy for me?

50:16.480 --> 50:20.115
Okay, whatever. I'm sure
you know what you're doing.

50:20.117 --> 50:21.952
Exactly, at least you get it.

50:23.186 --> 50:25.753
- Everything's under control.
- Just call me

50:25.755 --> 50:27.190
if anything happens.

50:39.202 --> 50:40.003
Hey.

50:41.704 --> 50:46.675
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going, huh?

50:47.844 --> 50:51.012
- Move!
- You're not going anywhere!

50:51.014 --> 50:54.249
You won't fucking-

50:55.652 --> 50:57.818
You're leaving with
some guy you just met!

50:57.820 --> 51:01.356
Can't stop thinking about
sucking cocks, can you?

51:01.358 --> 51:02.856
Why do you even
wanna be with me

51:02.858 --> 51:06.293
- if that's what you think?
- You're gonna regret this!

51:06.295 --> 51:07.563
Do you hear me?

52:19.101 --> 52:22.204
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful!

52:23.806 --> 52:25.708
The best part is we
have it all to ourselves.

52:28.644 --> 52:31.780
From here on out,
no more secrets.

52:33.282 --> 52:34.750
Okay.

52:37.521 --> 52:39.222
I feel like I've
been here before.

52:40.123 --> 52:41.555
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:41.557 --> 52:42.893
It's strangely familiar.

53:07.083 --> 53:12.088
This is amazing!

53:29.105 --> 53:33.876
This is really good. You
really are a good cook.

53:35.311 --> 53:36.246
It's my pleasure.

53:40.282 --> 53:41.784
What's on your mind?

53:45.088 --> 53:47.923
- I'm glad I came.
- Me too.

53:49.192 --> 53:54.128
Can I be honest
about something?

53:54.130 --> 53:54.965
Of course.

53:57.867 --> 54:00.635
My friends didn't
want me to come here.

54:00.637 --> 54:02.804
They thought this
was a bad idea, and-

54:02.806 --> 54:04.773
- You spoke with your
friends about me?

54:06.675 --> 54:07.476
Yeah.

54:09.846 --> 54:11.715
I thought you were
gonna be discrete.

54:13.282 --> 54:14.516
Didn't I make that clear?

54:24.494 --> 54:29.499
Who'd you talk to? Who knows?

54:31.233 --> 54:34.371
Just a couple friends.
They're good friends.

54:38.041 --> 54:41.510
I really wish you hadn't.

55:19.215 --> 55:21.718
Do you feel comfortable
here, Robert?

55:24.554 --> 55:28.121
- Yeah.
- Good.

55:28.123 --> 55:32.294
I pride myself on making
my guests feel welcome.

55:35.597 --> 55:38.500
What, you get a lot of
guys up here?

55:44.507 --> 55:47.307
I'm only kidding, it's a joke.

55:47.309 --> 55:48.411
Well it isn't funny.

55:49.913 --> 55:51.780
I liked you better
when you were shy.

55:53.849 --> 55:58.855
Sorry, it's like everything
I say is wrong tonight.

56:00.056 --> 56:01.023
How about trying to
say the right things?

56:08.030 --> 56:10.597
Exactly how far
are we from the city?

56:10.599 --> 56:14.770
- Why?
- It was quite a drive.

56:19.309 --> 56:21.641
We just got here, and
you're already thinking

56:21.643 --> 56:22.611
about running away?

56:25.914 --> 56:28.817
- Wow.
- Run away?

56:29.985 --> 56:33.989
From what? I don't wanna
be anywhere but here.

56:37.693 --> 56:39.429
Do your parents
know you're here?

56:40.697 --> 56:41.498
No.

56:44.501 --> 56:47.434
You didn't even
give me an address.

56:47.436 --> 56:49.405
But you would've told
them if you had it?

56:51.007 --> 56:54.376
My parents live in America.
We don't talk about much.

56:56.713 --> 56:58.548
And I didn't think
it was necessary.

56:59.615 --> 57:01.583
Why are you asking me this?

57:06.088 --> 57:06.922
Good boy.

57:12.996 --> 57:14.998
- Was it?
- Was it what?

57:15.998 --> 57:20.969
- Necessary?
- I don't know.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.340
What do you think?

57:28.077 --> 57:31.514
I mean, if you
were to disappear,

57:33.315 --> 57:35.050
no one would be
able to find you.

57:40.989 --> 57:45.994
I could be a serial
killer for all you know.

57:50.065 --> 57:51.233
There's a lake nearby.

57:54.603 --> 57:58.207
Your body would just decompose.

58:01.510 --> 58:06.114
There are no rangers up
here. No one can hear you.

58:14.824 --> 58:17.391
Ha!

58:21.197 --> 58:24.731
I'm just messing
with you.

58:24.733 --> 58:26.969
Little guy, you're
something else.

58:33.108 --> 58:34.376
Did I really scare you?

58:47.789 --> 58:51.126
Are you sure you wanna
sleep here alone?

58:52.195 --> 58:53.028
Yes.

58:57.132 --> 59:00.435
There's no WiFi here.
You're gonna get bored.

59:06.275 --> 59:07.943
Listen, I'm sorry
if I upset you.

59:14.050 --> 59:15.385
Are we good?

59:17.487 --> 59:19.956
Everything's perfect, stupid.

59:21.657 --> 59:23.358
Stop calling me stupid.

59:28.898 --> 59:30.530
Okay.

59:30.532 --> 59:31.366
Thanks.

59:34.036 --> 59:34.870
Stupid.

59:39.375 --> 59:42.409
And you still wonder
why I'm sleeping alone?

59:42.411 --> 59:44.513
Oh, so is that your
way of punishing me?

59:46.114 --> 59:48.884
- Do you like being punished?
- Do you?

59:50.385 --> 59:51.420
I asked you first.

59:55.525 --> 59:57.226
Aren't you
forgetting something?

1:00:19.414 --> 1:00:20.248
Good boy.

1:01:57.480 --> 1:01:58.280
Hugo?

1:02:18.900 --> 1:02:19.735
Hugo?

1:03:32.541 --> 1:03:35.041
What are you doing?

1:03:35.043 --> 1:03:36.846
Did I wake you?

1:03:39.715 --> 1:03:44.554
Are you watching porn?

1:03:45.822 --> 1:03:49.659
Go to bed.

1:03:53.829 --> 1:03:58.835
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

1:03:59.936 --> 1:04:02.104
Go to bed.

1:04:59.327 --> 1:05:01.030
What are you doing?

1:05:04.032 --> 1:05:07.267
Just wanted to make sure
you were sleeping okay.

1:05:07.269 --> 1:05:09.438
You scared me!

1:05:10.505 --> 1:05:11.873
You should get some rest.

1:06:54.710 --> 1:06:56.612
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1:06:58.280 --> 1:06:59.115
How was your first night?

1:07:00.715 --> 1:07:01.717
Not so good.

1:07:05.820 --> 1:07:06.654
That's too bad.

1:07:16.032 --> 1:07:17.998
What were you
doing on your laptop?

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.936
- It was pretty late.
- Just work stuff.

1:07:22.471 --> 1:07:24.173
But I thought
there was no WiFi?

1:07:26.074 --> 1:07:27.275
Oh, I don't need WiFi.

1:07:29.878 --> 1:07:31.380
What kind of work do you do?

1:07:34.949 --> 1:07:37.719
Eat your food,
it's gonna get cold.

1:08:15.291 --> 1:08:16.125
Stop!

1:08:17.659 --> 1:08:19.327
Aren't you hungry?

1:08:23.865 --> 1:08:25.201
Put that away!

1:08:37.313 --> 1:08:39.114
You're in my house now.

1:08:40.748 --> 1:08:41.750
And there are rules.

1:08:43.652 --> 1:08:46.922
So next time I present it
to you, you fuckin' take it.

1:08:48.056 --> 1:08:53.061
Understood?

1:09:11.980 --> 1:09:16.316
Hey, I get very
possessive of things.

1:09:16.318 --> 1:09:18.320
And you should take
it as a compliment.

1:09:19.755 --> 1:09:21.356
Except I'm not a thing.

1:09:23.125 --> 1:09:26.694
Isn't this great? I love
being surrounded by nature.

1:09:30.198 --> 1:09:32.201
You've been so rude
since we got here.

1:09:33.536 --> 1:09:35.971
What happened? Did
I do something?

1:09:38.173 --> 1:09:40.708
- Always playing the victim.
- So what is it?

1:09:43.244 --> 1:09:45.346
I'm not very patient, Robert.

1:09:46.515 --> 1:09:48.617
- I'm getting tired.
- Tired of what?

1:09:50.386 --> 1:09:53.085
I just want you to
be honest with me.

1:09:53.087 --> 1:09:56.190
My wife wouldn't appreciate me
cheating on her with a liar.

1:09:56.192 --> 1:09:57.790
Your wife?

1:09:57.792 --> 1:09:59.293
Yeah

1:09:59.295 --> 1:10:02.896
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Why would I be kidding?

1:10:02.898 --> 1:10:04.798
I thought you knew!

1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:06.833
Hugo, you told
me you were gay.

1:10:06.835 --> 1:10:09.068
- I never said that.
- But you swore you loved me!

1:10:09.070 --> 1:10:11.774
- I do love you, stupid!
- Don't call me that!

1:10:12.942 --> 1:10:15.476
How can you be so
calm? I trusted you!

1:10:17.579 --> 1:10:20.082
As if that even
means anything anymore!

1:10:21.483 --> 1:10:23.786
I would never, ever
sleep with a married man.

1:10:25.421 --> 1:10:26.755
Why do you think
the sex is so great?

1:10:27.957 --> 1:10:31.293
Because it's forbidden.
And now you have values?

1:10:32.927 --> 1:10:35.062
You're making me feel
like a cheap whore.

1:10:35.064 --> 1:10:37.863
I'm not making you
feel anything, all right?

1:10:37.865 --> 1:10:42.068
You're my second best. That's
a pretty good place to be!

1:10:42.070 --> 1:10:45.140
- You're such an asshole!
- You'll thank me later.

1:10:46.574 --> 1:10:47.842
Maybe I thank your wife.

1:10:54.283 --> 1:10:57.317
- You're hurting me!
- Don't you love it?

1:11:37.192 --> 1:11:39.360
Playing too rough for you?

1:11:42.331 --> 1:11:45.234
- I'm sorry, hey.
- It's okay.

1:11:48.069 --> 1:11:50.238
I guess I really am not
good enough for you.

1:11:51.739 --> 1:11:56.343
- I don't have a pussy.
- That's not it.

1:11:56.345 --> 1:12:00.548
- And you know it.
- A wife?

1:12:01.949 --> 1:12:04.485
If you cared about us you'd
be willing to leave her.

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:08.054
It's not that simple.

1:12:08.056 --> 1:12:11.991
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1:12:11.993 --> 1:12:14.794
- No you don't!
- Yes I do.

1:12:14.796 --> 1:12:17.830
- No you don't!
- Come here.

1:12:42.457 --> 1:12:43.692
Can I join you?

1:13:10.985 --> 1:13:13.322
- Why did you come here?
- Huh?

1:13:14.789 --> 1:13:18.157
Why did you
agree to come here?

1:13:18.159 --> 1:13:20.429
- You asked me to.
- So?

1:13:22.698 --> 1:13:26.333
I thought we could get
to know each other better.

1:13:26.335 --> 1:13:30.504
- You do everything I say.
- No.

1:13:30.506 --> 1:13:31.340
Are you sure?

1:13:37.212 --> 1:13:42.217
We are complete strangers,
aren't we Robert?

1:13:44.886 --> 1:13:46.354
I guess you could say that.

1:13:47.722 --> 1:13:50.523
Although, I do feel
like I know you.

1:13:50.525 --> 1:13:51.326
Is that so?

1:13:53.595 --> 1:13:57.166
Tell me one thing you
know about me for a fact.

1:14:00.101 --> 1:14:01.668
No.

1:14:01.670 --> 1:14:05.906
I know nothing about you.
Is that what you wanna hear?

1:14:05.908 --> 1:14:09.742
No, I don't wanna hear
that, but it's the truth.

1:14:09.744 --> 1:14:13.314
Yeah, you know
nothing about me either.

1:14:14.382 --> 1:14:16.885
See that, I wouldn't
be so sure of.

1:14:19.688 --> 1:14:21.390
I know a lot about you, Robert.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:26.195
- I'm sure you can imagine.
- What can I imagine?

1:14:27.563 --> 1:14:29.696
I'm actually quite surprised

1:14:29.698 --> 1:14:31.897
by how shy a guy
you can be in person

1:14:31.899 --> 1:14:34.135
unless you're just
playing me off.

1:14:35.470 --> 1:14:38.138
- What can I imagine?
- With the internet nowadays,

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:40.674
everything's
accessible.

1:14:45.046 --> 1:14:49.182
- What's funny?
- I don't even have Facebook.

1:14:57.926 --> 1:14:59.361
God, you're something else.

1:15:21.850 --> 1:15:23.018
Are you going to
fucking look at me?

1:15:27.689 --> 1:15:28.690
Are you still upset?

1:15:34.662 --> 1:15:35.496
Okay.

1:15:39.835 --> 1:15:41.703
It's clearer to me now
you just want me for sex.

1:15:44.439 --> 1:15:45.874
I love you.

1:15:47.876 --> 1:15:50.579
Everybody loves
my work but nobody loves me.

1:15:51.813 --> 1:15:54.848
- What?
- What?

1:15:54.850 --> 1:15:57.483
- What was that?
- What was what?

1:15:57.485 --> 1:16:00.152
- What work do you do?
- I don't work, do you?

1:16:00.154 --> 1:16:02.523
- Yes, I do.
- What do you do?

1:16:06.561 --> 1:16:09.862
- Do we know each other?
- We've known each other

1:16:09.864 --> 1:16:12.432
- for about a week?
- No,

1:16:12.434 --> 1:16:14.503
you definitely
remind me of someone.

1:16:15.436 --> 1:16:18.974
I just can't put
my finger on it.

1:16:22.711 --> 1:16:25.681
I have an idea of where
I could put my finger.

1:17:24.072 --> 1:17:25.007
Last night was fun.

1:17:26.375 --> 1:17:29.241
I'll bet your wife
doesn't swallow.

1:17:33.881 --> 1:17:35.349
I could use some fresh air.

1:17:36.417 --> 1:17:38.786
- Let's go for a walk.
- Okay.

1:17:51.699 --> 1:17:56.537
I've been so curious,
what do you know about me?

1:18:00.307 --> 1:18:02.978
You said you know
a lot, I'm curious.

1:18:07.481 --> 1:18:08.483
You don't wanna talk now?

1:18:14.488 --> 1:18:16.690
Would a normal guy
agree to a getaway

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:21.029
- with a complete stranger?
- I don't know, would he?

1:18:24.565 --> 1:18:26.768
Sex doesn't make
either of us trustworthy.

1:18:28.470 --> 1:18:30.005
Or is that your idea of trust?

1:18:31.439 --> 1:18:33.406
Again, I thought
the idea of this was

1:18:33.408 --> 1:18:35.043
to get to know
each other better.

1:18:38.113 --> 1:18:39.414
You're amazing, Robert.

1:18:41.315 --> 1:18:44.351
I don't want anyone touching
you ever again. Understood?

1:18:46.688 --> 1:18:47.655
I'm all yours.

1:19:01.636 --> 1:19:02.869
Liar!

1:19:05.606 --> 1:19:06.440
What the fuck?

1:19:16.585 --> 1:19:20.486
What's with all the violence?
I'm getting sick of it!

1:19:20.488 --> 1:19:22.022
Do you trust me?

1:19:23.125 --> 1:19:27.026
- You're scaring me.
- Oh am I now?

1:19:27.028 --> 1:19:28.329
Yes, you are!

1:19:29.898 --> 1:19:31.731
We haven't even
gotten started.

1:19:31.733 --> 1:19:34.136
- With what?
- With my games.

1:19:35.302 --> 1:19:37.970
I have some fantasies
I'd like to fulfill

1:19:37.972 --> 1:19:41.576
- and I think you can help.
- What fantasies?

1:19:43.979 --> 1:19:46.914
I think you know. Does that
make you feel uncomfortable?

1:19:48.082 --> 1:19:50.849
No it doesn't, but
it just won't happen.

1:19:50.851 --> 1:19:55.856
I don't think you
understand. I'm not asking.

1:19:58.326 --> 1:20:00.127
What are you gonna
do if I say no?

1:20:01.896 --> 1:20:05.100
I always get my way.
Haven't you noticed?

1:20:06.768 --> 1:20:09.104
I'm starting to
get paranoid here.

1:20:10.271 --> 1:20:13.408
- What are you doing?
- Stop pretending!

1:20:14.842 --> 1:20:16.409
I just want you to do the
things from the videos.

1:20:16.411 --> 1:20:20.248
- Is that too much to ask?
- What videos?

1:20:22.117 --> 1:20:24.017
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1:20:24.019 --> 1:20:25.686
You're sick, you're sick.

1:20:26.921 --> 1:20:31.892
Am I, Robert? Or
should I call you Colby?

1:20:37.364 --> 1:20:38.532
What? Colby?

1:20:40.467 --> 1:20:42.802
What are you talking about?

1:20:50.377 --> 1:20:51.246
Col? Colby?

1:20:53.582 --> 1:20:55.817
See I wanna do
that. Just that.

1:21:02.823 --> 1:21:05.492
God.

1:21:06.328 --> 1:21:07.495
Turn it off!

1:21:17.104 --> 1:21:19.339
Turn that fucking shit off!

1:21:19.341 --> 1:21:22.143
See, that's the
Robert I want! Savage!

1:21:24.246 --> 1:21:27.548
That's not me!

1:21:29.117 --> 1:21:32.554
- It sure looks like you.
- I've never...

1:21:34.421 --> 1:21:37.322
That's not me!

1:21:39.060 --> 1:21:41.693
That's it. I've had
enough of your shit.

1:21:57.878 --> 1:22:02.615
Be a good boy, Colby.

1:22:27.042 --> 1:22:28.877
What've you got there?

1:22:33.480 --> 1:22:36.648
A drink.

1:22:36.650 --> 1:22:40.820
Are you okay?

1:22:40.822 --> 1:22:43.692
I always told my mother
I'd have a better life.

1:22:45.092 --> 1:22:48.928
With all that trust fund
money, I could be anything.

1:22:48.930 --> 1:22:52.531
And yet here I am
with you.

1:22:52.533 --> 1:22:54.234
- You're wasted.
- Yeah.

1:22:55.369 --> 1:22:57.538
- You should be happy.
- Why's that?

1:22:59.073 --> 1:23:02.277
When I'm drunk, I'm the
biggest whore there is.

1:23:03.677 --> 1:23:05.812
Isn't that what you
want, a whore?

1:23:05.814 --> 1:23:07.481
No, not if you're drunk.

1:23:09.516 --> 1:23:13.152
You fucked me
without my consent

1:23:13.154 --> 1:23:15.053
and you won't fuck me drunk?

1:23:15.055 --> 1:23:18.960
- Talk about values, value boy.
- Not happenin'.

1:23:20.528 --> 1:23:22.564
Not happening.

1:23:24.765 --> 1:23:28.369
When I'm drunk, I don't
have a gag reflex.

1:23:30.939 --> 1:23:33.141
Like you're gonna pass on that.

1:23:43.885 --> 1:23:44.719
Robert. Robert!

1:23:52.527 --> 1:23:54.128
I think you're making a mistake.

1:23:58.666 --> 1:23:59.801
He cares about you!

1:24:05.039 --> 1:24:05.873
Robert!

1:24:18.653 --> 1:24:22.323
- Kate, how did you get here?
- Are you okay?

1:24:23.557 --> 1:24:26.625
- Not really, he's crazy!
- I told you

1:24:26.627 --> 1:24:29.629
- this was a bad idea!
- I know you told me.

1:24:29.631 --> 1:24:32.098
But please, do something!

1:24:32.100 --> 1:24:34.232
You need to get me out of here!

1:24:34.234 --> 1:24:36.637
We can take his
car. He won't even notice!

1:24:38.073 --> 1:24:41.206
He's crazy, he thinks I'm
some porn actor or something.

1:24:41.208 --> 1:24:42.510
What do you mean?

1:24:43.944 --> 1:24:47.280
He showed me a video of
a guy who looks like me.

1:24:47.282 --> 1:24:51.750
Robert, you were
doing porn before that night!

1:24:51.752 --> 1:24:54.320
Christian was getting
you out of it.

1:24:54.322 --> 1:24:56.289
Don't you remember?

1:25:00.395 --> 1:25:02.430
Who are you talkin' to?

1:25:07.435 --> 1:25:09.204
Back there, who
are you talkin' to?

1:25:10.704 --> 1:25:14.107
- No one.
- You were saying something.

1:25:16.845 --> 1:25:18.613
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:25:20.047 --> 1:25:23.883
It's cold out.
Let's go inside.

1:25:44.072 --> 1:25:45.405
Come on. Sit down.

1:25:47.141 --> 1:25:50.377
- Why?
- I wanna talk to you.

1:25:51.645 --> 1:25:54.282
But don't touch me.

1:25:57.618 --> 1:25:58.452
Okay.

1:26:13.234 --> 1:26:16.067
This isn't really
working, is it?

1:26:16.069 --> 1:26:17.104
Not really, no.

1:26:22.042 --> 1:26:23.545
Okay.

1:26:27.582 --> 1:26:32.453
- When are we going back?
- We're not going back.

1:26:37.492 --> 1:26:40.593
Not until we clear things up.

1:26:40.595 --> 1:26:43.495
- Clear what up?
- Now look,

1:26:43.497 --> 1:26:47.234
let's just be honest,
okay, I'll go first.

1:26:49.938 --> 1:26:53.775
I don't have a wife. I lied.

1:26:55.042 --> 1:26:55.876
Why?

1:26:57.045 --> 1:26:59.010
The moment I told
you I had a wife,

1:26:59.012 --> 1:27:01.513
you became desperate
to please my needs.

1:27:01.515 --> 1:27:05.586
- And you did.
- You are so manipulative.

1:27:07.622 --> 1:27:08.923
Can I ask you something?

1:27:11.626 --> 1:27:14.125
Why are you lying
about the porn?

1:27:18.332 --> 1:27:21.032
- Where's Christian?
- Not here!

1:27:34.716 --> 1:27:39.721
Hey, I need you to
focus. I need you to focus.

1:27:40.188 --> 1:27:42.623
Why?

1:27:45.760 --> 1:27:47.829
I really wanna go home.

1:27:48.997 --> 1:27:51.231
I wish things had
been different.

1:27:53.167 --> 1:27:54.002
Okay.

1:27:55.970 --> 1:27:58.670
Why don't you get your things.

1:27:58.672 --> 1:28:02.676
I have to do something
first and when I get back,

1:28:03.578 --> 1:28:04.412
we can go.

1:28:28.502 --> 1:28:29.503
Oh my God!

1:28:31.338 --> 1:28:32.774
I was doing porn?

1:28:36.210 --> 1:28:38.445
What did I do with my life?

1:30:48.643 --> 1:30:50.778
I'm fucking Colby Raines!

1:31:08.229 --> 1:31:10.696
You
can't save me, Christian!

1:31:10.698 --> 1:31:14.165
- I love you, Robert.
- Everybody loves my work

1:31:14.167 --> 1:31:15.836
but nobody loves me.

1:31:17.438 --> 1:31:18.538
I have to go.

1:32:16.697 --> 1:32:18.231
Robert?

1:33:08.716 --> 1:33:13.721
Fuck!

1:34:24.524 --> 1:34:25.358
Fuck!

1:34:50.184 --> 1:34:51.482
Robert!

1:35:12.238 --> 1:35:14.339
Fuck!

1:36:00.954 --> 1:36:01.788
Robert.

1:36:04.759 --> 1:36:06.127
It's Colby.

1:36:07.828 --> 1:36:09.029
I was looking for you.

1:36:11.030 --> 1:36:14.268
Well, I've been waiting
here for you like a good boy.

1:36:18.671 --> 1:36:20.507
What are you gonna
do with the video?

1:36:21.975 --> 1:36:23.976
What do you think?

1:36:29.182 --> 1:36:31.282
If you can forget my past,

1:36:31.284 --> 1:36:33.354
I'm more than willing
to forget yours.

1:36:34.954 --> 1:36:37.388
What are you saying?

1:36:37.390 --> 1:36:41.692
We can get rid of that
video. No one needs to know.

1:36:41.694 --> 1:36:45.398
I like that. You
can forgive me?

1:36:46.667 --> 1:36:47.501
Yes.

1:36:50.270 --> 1:36:54.740
You're my dream boy. Ever
since the first time I saw you.

1:36:54.742 --> 1:36:59.747
I love you, and I
need you inside me now.

1:37:13.594 --> 1:37:14.992
Yeah!

1:38:29.168 --> 1:38:32.405
It's such a pity how things
turned out, isn't it?

1:38:37.478 --> 1:38:40.079
I forgive you, I do.

1:38:42.448 --> 1:38:44.117
But when I saw the chloroform,

1:38:45.286 --> 1:38:46.987
I understood this
was about survival.

1:38:52.725 --> 1:38:55.895
What were you planning
on doing to me?

1:39:00.033 --> 1:39:02.534
Well, I'm gonna go now.

1:39:13.546 --> 1:39:15.446
Farewell, Hugo.

1:40:19.979 --> 1:40:21.713
You didn't actually
believe I was gonna

1:40:21.715 --> 1:40:24.118
let you die slowly
in here, did you?

1:40:29.288 --> 1:40:32.290
It would be a painful death.

1:40:47.474 --> 1:40:49.009
All the porn I did,

1:40:50.210 --> 1:40:53.346
and yet you were the
greatest fuck of all.

1:40:55.748 --> 1:40:56.582
Hugo,

1:41:01.087 --> 1:41:05.992
I love you. I
love you so much.

1:42:38.784 --> 1:42:42.286
Hey
Hugo, did you manage

1:42:42.288 --> 1:42:43.389
to kill him this time?

1:42:45.292 --> 1:42:49.496
I really need that trust
fund money. Are you there?
