00:02.184 --> 00:05.012
<i>... Carla was facing the decision
that all new moms have to face.</i>

00:05.573 --> 00:07.291
<i>Whether she should
go back to work.</i>

00:07.292 --> 00:10.111
Ok, so.
If we take my salary...

00:10.112 --> 00:13.172
... and subtract the cost
of a full-time nanny...

00:13.173 --> 00:16.812
... plus her health insurance,
we will still end up with...

00:17.867 --> 00:20.252
... losing US$5 a month?!?!

00:20.253 --> 00:23.787
This is completely your decision.
I'm ok one way or the other.

00:23.788 --> 00:26.432
Maybe I'll try staying home
with Izzy for a year.

00:26.816 --> 00:27.789
Yes!!!!

00:33.779 --> 00:36.594
<i>As for me, ever since my
pregnant girlfriend left...</i>

00:36.595 --> 00:38.798
<i>... I've been a little clingy
with my roommate.</i>

00:38.983 --> 00:40.563
JD, I'm going to get a drink
from the water fountain.

00:40.564 --> 00:41.166
Do you wanna come?

00:41.993 --> 00:44.432
Please, Elliot.
I'm not that desperate.

00:44.606 --> 00:46.211
<i>Although I am a little parched.</i>

00:46.411 --> 00:48.644
<i>Plus I could hold back her hair.</i>

00:51.589 --> 00:52.595
Are you okay, ma'am?

00:53.203 --> 00:55.493
<i>How many fingers do you see?</i>

00:56.804 --> 00:59.104
<i>Call 911 emergency.</i>

01:00.135 --> 01:02.226
<i>Why are you singing?</i>

01:02.227 --> 01:05.132
<i>Wait!
Why am I singing?</i>

01:05.745 --> 01:07.888
<i>Is there someone here with you?</i>

01:08.859 --> 01:11.608
<i>Someone that we could talk to?</i>

01:12.495 --> 01:19.386
<i>Are you okay?
Are you alright?</i>

01:23.084 --> 01:24.697
The mind is a freaky thing, Elliot.

01:24.698 --> 01:26.102
Maybe she does hear singing.

01:26.103 --> 01:28.188
I haven't sung since
the 6th grade talent show...

01:28.189 --> 01:30.477
... when I did Pat Benatar's
"Hell Is For Children".

01:30.651 --> 01:32.758
Then afterwards Mr. Shaman,
the MC, said...

01:32.759 --> 01:35.695
... "No. Actually hell is for everyone who
just had to hear you sing that song."

01:35.696 --> 01:37.976
My mom was so mad, she slept
with him and ruined his marriage.

01:37.977 --> 01:39.337
Let's see how she's doing.

01:47.534 --> 01:49.110
<i>Hello, I'm Dr. Kelso.</i>

01:49.111 --> 01:50.661
<i>I'm delighted that you came.</i>

01:50.662 --> 01:52.269
<i>So the doctors say you fainted...</i>

01:52.270 --> 01:53.933
<i>... and you don't know
what's to blame.</i>

01:54.054 --> 01:55.497
<i>Well, put your mind at ease.</i>

01:55.498 --> 01:57.181
<i>There's no ill we hadn't outsmarted.</i>

01:57.182 --> 01:59.135
<i>On behalf of all who work here...</i>

01:59.328 --> 02:04.372
<i>... welcome to Sacred Heart!!</i>

02:04.967 --> 02:08.518
<i>Our facilities are excellent,
you couldn't ask for more.</i>

02:08.519 --> 02:11.731
<i>As long as you avoid the
bathrooms on the second floor.</i>

02:11.732 --> 02:14.970
<i>This is Dr. Cox,
I'll be giving him your chart.</i>

02:14.971 --> 02:19.616
<i>And that's Dr. Kelso,
the kissass of Sacred Heart.</i>

02:19.617 --> 02:22.564
<i>You say you burned
your hand real bad,</i>

02:22.565 --> 02:25.350
<i>... we'll fix you up with gauze.</i>

02:25.639 --> 02:28.742
<i>Perhaps you need
your fat sucked out...</i>

02:28.743 --> 02:30.994
<i>- ... or one smallish nose.
- Hey !</i>

02:31.989 --> 02:37.466
<i>If you caught a STD
from some tasty little tart.</i>

02:37.467 --> 02:40.927
<i>We swear we won't judge
you here at Sacred... </i>

02:41.157 --> 02:50.230
<i>Here at Sacred...
Here at Sacred Heart !!!</i>

03:04.990 --> 03:07.756
<i>One more thing that I should mention...</i>

03:07.973 --> 03:09.540
<i>... if what I heard is true.</i>

03:10.095 --> 03:14.259
<i>And everyone appears
to be singing to you.</i>

03:16.680 --> 03:18.608
<i>Your case is very serious.</i>

03:18.609 --> 03:20.091
<i>And we better start.</i>

03:20.092 --> 03:23.146
<i>'Cos if you think we're singing,</i>

03:23.147 --> 03:28.260
<i>- ... you belong at Sacred Heart.
- Doctors! Nurses!</i>

03:28.261 --> 03:30.007
<i>Patients! Dead Guys!</i>

03:30.451 --> 03:41.807
<i>Welcome to Sacred Heart !!</i>

<i><b>Scrubs - 606. My Musical</b></i>

03:56.757 --> 03:59.932
<i><b>Transcripted and synched by

03:59.967 --> 04:02.060
<i><b>Thanks to:

04:06.739 --> 04:09.959
So Mrs. Miller passed both otological
and neurological exams.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.791
We cannot find anything that
explains why she's hearing music.

04:13.236 --> 04:14.404
How about this for an explanation:

04:14.992 --> 04:16.572
... she's cuckoo pants.

04:17.189 --> 04:19.423
Run some more tests
and turf her to Psych.

04:23.366 --> 04:24.961
<i>Hey, Mrs. Miller.</i>

04:24.962 --> 04:27.517
<i>We just need a stool sample.</i>

04:28.062 --> 04:29.518
<i>Why do you need a stool sample...</i>

04:29.519 --> 04:31.735
<i>... if you think I'm just a nut?</i>

04:32.632 --> 04:34.004
<i>- 'Cause the answer is not...
- 'Cause the answer is not...</i>

04:34.010 --> 04:35.285
<i>- ... in your head, my dear.
- ... in your head, my dear.</i>

04:35.676 --> 04:37.068
<i>- It's in your butt.
- It's in your butt.</i>

04:38.193 --> 04:41.989
<i>You see?
Everything comes down to poo.</i>

04:42.430 --> 04:45.774
<i>From the top of your head
to the sole of your shoe.</i>

04:45.775 --> 04:48.535
<i>We can figure out
what is wrong with you...</i>

04:48.536 --> 04:50.706
<i>... by looking at your poo.</i>

04:50.859 --> 04:51.682
<i>Turk.</i>

04:51.683 --> 04:54.240
<i>Do you have a hemorrhoid?</i>

04:54.241 --> 04:56.893
<i>Or is it rectal cancer?</i>

04:57.454 --> 04:59.798
<i>When you flush your dookie down...</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:02.700
<i>... you flush away the answer.</i>

05:02.701 --> 05:07.822
<i>It doesn't really matter
if it's hard of it's loose.</i>

05:08.187 --> 05:11.049
<i>We'll figure out what's ailing you.</i>

05:11.050 --> 05:14.226
<i>As long as it's a deuce.
Yes !</i>

05:14.420 --> 05:17.058
<i>-Everything comes down to poo.
-Everything comes down to poo.</i>

05:17.059 --> 05:20.056
<i>Cardiovascular, lymphatic, yes
the nervous system too.</i>

05:20.343 --> 05:23.276
<i>All across the nation,
we trust in defecation.</i>

05:23.277 --> 05:25.607
<i>Everything comes down to poo.</i>

05:26.304 --> 05:28.985
<i>If you want to know what's wrong...</i>

05:28.986 --> 05:31.830
<i>... don't sit and act so cool.</i>

05:31.981 --> 05:34.761
<i>Just be a man and eat some bran.</i>

05:34.762 --> 05:37.567
<i>And drop the kids off at the pool.</i>

05:38.130 --> 05:40.801
<i>- My stomach hurts.
- Check the poo.</i>

05:41.343 --> 05:43.866
<i>- I sprained my ankle.
- Check the poo.</i>

05:44.260 --> 05:46.812
<i>- I was shot.
- Check the poo.</i>

05:46.813 --> 05:49.418
<i>- A homeless guy just pooed in my eye.
- Check the poo.</i>

05:50.061 --> 05:53.099
<i>- Mine or his?
- First him then you.</i>

05:53.634 --> 05:56.472
<i>It may sound gross.</i>

05:56.681 --> 05:58.882
<i>You may say "shush".</i>

05:59.334 --> 06:04.423
<i>But we need to see what
comes out of your tush.</i>

06:04.912 --> 06:06.154
<i>Because...</i>

06:06.513 --> 06:08.620
<i>... everything comes down to poo.</i>

06:09.481 --> 06:12.659
<i>Whether it is a tumor
or a touch of the flu.</i>

06:12.978 --> 06:15.718
<i>Please, won't you pinch
us all a big fat clue.</i>

06:15.719 --> 06:18.648
<i>Our number one test
is your number two.</i>

06:19.180 --> 06:21.835
<i>If there's no breeze,
light a match please.</i>

06:21.836 --> 06:24.203
<i>Everything comes down to...</i>

06:24.204 --> 06:25.829
<i>- Doo doo.
- Doo doo.</i>

06:25.830 --> 06:27.444
<i>- Doo doo.
- Doo doo.</i>

06:27.445 --> 06:29.838
<i>Everything comes down to poo!!</i>

06:32.728 --> 06:33.754
Guess what, you guys?

06:34.391 --> 06:35.917
I put an offer on a little house...

06:36.156 --> 06:37.657
... and it just got accepted.

06:37.912 --> 06:40.174
- Congratulations.
- That's awesome!!

06:40.234 --> 06:43.264
- My own house.
- C'mon, baby. See ya!!

06:43.265 --> 06:45.223
I'm so excited for us.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.945
Does he think that
he's moving in with me?

06:48.946 --> 06:50.558
That would be a yes.

06:50.892 --> 06:53.077
Excuse me, ex-nurse Turkelton.

06:53.078 --> 06:55.612
But if you want to
hang out around here...

06:55.613 --> 06:57.866
... you're going to
need a visitor's badge.

06:59.283 --> 07:01.959
<i>So, Carla...</i>

07:01.960 --> 07:04.670
<i>... when will you be back?</i>

07:05.256 --> 07:08.687
<i>Not for a year.</i>

07:09.313 --> 07:12.110
<i>A year?!?!</i>

07:12.111 --> 07:20.817
<i>Not for one long,
long year.</i>

07:25.763 --> 07:27.932
<i>We understand you love that kid.</i>

07:27.933 --> 07:30.300
<i>But this ain't no way to treat us.</i>

07:30.301 --> 07:32.637
<i>And I hesitate to say you did...</i>

07:32.638 --> 07:34.828
<i>... what Judas done to Jesus.</i>

07:35.024 --> 07:37.223
<i>When you leave us all,
we'll be upset.</i>

07:37.224 --> 07:39.534
Look out.
That floor is very wet.

07:39.535 --> 07:41.470
<i>We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

07:41.605 --> 07:43.980
<i>We're gonna miss you 'round here.</i>

07:43.981 --> 07:46.148
<i>We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

07:46.316 --> 07:49.001
<i>We're saying this
through a lot of tears.</i>

07:49.002 --> 07:51.161
<i>How will everybody
get along without you... </i>

07:51.162 --> 07:53.337
<i>... for a long, long year?</i>

07:53.498 --> 07:57.058
<i>Who'll tell me that my
new toupee looks sweet?</i>

07:57.806 --> 08:01.275
<i>Who'll treat my gay son's rash
and be discreet?</i>

08:02.541 --> 08:05.893
<i>Who'll give me better ways
to say "man meat"?</i>

08:06.163 --> 08:08.848
- Pincho chiquito.
- Thanks. I'm using that.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.425
<i>We're gonna miss you 'round here.</i>

08:11.818 --> 08:13.888
<i>We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

08:14.098 --> 08:16.805
<i>We're saying this
through a lot of tears.</i>

08:16.806 --> 08:18.786
<i>How will everybody
get along without you...</i>

08:18.787 --> 08:21.153
<i>... for a long, long year?</i>

08:21.154 --> 08:25.591
<i>My baby made the choice
to be at home and not at work.</i>

08:25.825 --> 08:30.459
<i>So let us all rejoice 'cause
she's the brand new mama Turk.</i>

08:30.460 --> 08:31.511
<i>He's right, of course.</i>

08:31.512 --> 08:33.784
<i>And yet my heart in spite of this...</i>

08:33.784 --> 08:36.729
<i>- ... feels torn apart.
- We're gonna miss you, Carla.</i>

08:37.256 --> 08:39.542
<i>We're gonna miss you 'round here.</i>

08:39.543 --> 08:41.720
<i>I need a tissue, Carla.</i>

08:41.721 --> 08:44.186
<i>We're saying this
through a lot of tears.</i>

08:44.187 --> 08:46.455
<i>How we ever gonna
get along without you?</i>

08:46.642 --> 08:48.925
<i>How we ever gonna
get along without you?</i>

08:48.926 --> 08:51.183
<i>How we ever gonna
get along without you?</i>

08:51.863 --> 08:52.927
Lunch!!

08:53.568 --> 09:02.708
<i>It's gonna be a long, long year.</i>

09:06.075 --> 09:09.688
<i>Dr. Cox, I'm not crazy.</i>

09:10.079 --> 09:12.446
<i>Am I still singing?</i>

09:12.447 --> 09:15.618
<i>Singing like a bird.</i>

09:15.619 --> 09:17.719
<i>Dr. Cox, huge news.</i>

09:17.720 --> 09:23.721
<i>I pulled some strings and got the
parking spot right behind yours.</i>

09:24.364 --> 09:26.832
<i>Bumper buddies.</i>

09:27.281 --> 09:30.835
<i>Still, you're not nearly as bad as her.</i>

09:31.251 --> 09:35.084
<i>Do you know how much you annoy me?</i>

09:35.332 --> 09:37.785
The answer is: a lot.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.918
<i>Should I list the reasons why?</i>

09:39.919 --> 09:43.266
<i>Well, I don't see why not.</i>

09:44.428 --> 09:46.955
<i> It's your hair, your nose, your chinless
face, you always need a hug. </i>

09:46.956 --> 09:49.551
<i>Not to mention all the manly
appletinis that you chug.</i>

09:49.552 --> 09:52.053
<i>That you think I am your mentor
just continues to perplex.</i>

09:52.054 --> 09:54.538
<i>And, oh my God, stop telling me
when you have nerdy sex.</i>

09:54.539 --> 09:56.487
By the way, last time
Kim was in town...

09:56.488 --> 09:59.210
... we got some appletinis and
poured them on her good parts.

09:59.211 --> 10:01.852
<i>See now, Newbie? That's the thing
you do that drives me up a tree.</i>

10:01.853 --> 10:04.157
<i>'Cos no matter how I rant
at you, you never let me be.</i>

10:04.158 --> 10:06.785
<i>So I'm stuck with all your daydreaming,
your wish to be my son.</i>

10:06.786 --> 10:09.312
<i> It makes me suicidal and
I'm not the only one.</i>

10:09.313 --> 10:11.789
<i>No I'm not the only one...</i>

10:14.400 --> 10:19.942
<i>It all started with
a penny in the door.</i>

10:20.366 --> 10:26.528
<i>There was a hatred
I had never felt before.</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:31.070
<i>So now I make him pay,</i>

10:31.633 --> 10:35.378
<i>...  each and every day.</i>

10:35.379 --> 10:45.840
<i> Until that moussed hair
little nuance is no more.</i>

10:47.413 --> 10:49.919
<i>So now that is why I call you
names like Carol, Jane and Sue.</i>

10:49.920 --> 10:52.521
<i>Like Moesha, Kim and Lilly
and Suzanne and Betty Lou.</i>

10:52.522 --> 10:55.016
<i> Regardless of the names I pick
my feelings are quite clear.</i>

10:55.017 --> 10:57.777
<i>You're a pain in every day
of every month of every year.</i>

10:57.922 --> 11:00.590
<i> Dr. Cox, you gotta help me
'cos I really am distressed.</i>

11:00.591 --> 11:03.021
<i>Can't you find another option,
won't you run another test?</i>

11:03.022 --> 11:05.592
<i>If you want some kind of favor,
really any kind of favor, </i>

11:05.593 --> 11:08.355
<i>... please just get me peace and
quiet from this godforsaken pest.</i>

11:08.356 --> 11:11.426
I think what my bumper
buddy is trying to say...

11:11.427 --> 11:14.410
<i>Shut your cakehole, Marybeth.</i>

11:14.411 --> 11:19.347
<i>Or I swear to God
I'll shut it soon.</i>

11:20.013 --> 11:24.301
<i>Congratulations, we'll schedule
your test this afternoon.</i>

11:29.430 --> 11:31.899
I know JD's in a bad place.
But I'm an adult.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.795
I'm making good money.
I just wanna live by myself.

11:33.796 --> 11:35.743
So just tell him.

11:36.218 --> 11:38.311
So it's that easy?
Why don't you just tell Turk...

11:38.312 --> 11:39.669
... that you wanna
go back to work?

11:40.150 --> 11:41.505
What the hell am I gonna do?

11:42.907 --> 11:45.785
<i>- I could tell a bunch of lies.
- I could buy him his own place.</i>

11:45.786 --> 11:49.698
<i>- I could bring the baby here with me.
- Or tell him there's no space.</i>

11:50.159 --> 11:52.439
Those are some lameass ideas.

11:52.440 --> 11:54.014
We're so screwed.

11:58.243 --> 12:00.658
<i>I'm sure you must be scared.</i>

12:00.659 --> 12:02.848
<i>Not knowing what
this test will bring.</i>

12:02.849 --> 12:04.991
<i>It could prove
that you are crazy.</i>

12:04.992 --> 12:07.361
<i>Do you still hear people sing?</i>

12:08.457 --> 12:10.437
<i>It's best to know the truth.</i>

12:10.656 --> 12:12.496
<i>Of that I have no doubt.</i>

12:12.497 --> 12:15.583
<i>But you'll have to face the future.</i>

12:15.584 --> 12:17.265
<i>When the truth comes out.</i>

12:17.997 --> 12:20.483
<i>We are running a test
that's a waste of our time.</i>

12:20.484 --> 12:22.651
<i>But at least she'll accept
she's medically fine.</i>

12:22.652 --> 12:24.990
<i>She'll admit that she's nuts
or I'll have to say "snore".</i>

12:24.991 --> 12:28.090
<i>Just give her the CAT-Scan
and show her the door.</i>

12:29.149 --> 12:30.877
<i>While we process your results,</i>

12:31.062 --> 12:32.775
<i>... we'll take you back to wait.</i>

12:32.776 --> 12:34.499
<i>We've got drugs to calm you down.</i>

12:34.500 --> 12:36.614
<i>So you don't stress about your fate.</i>

12:36.732 --> 12:38.426
<i>It's best to know the truth.</i>

12:38.692 --> 12:40.340
<i>Of that we have no doubt.</i>

12:40.341 --> 12:43.955
<i>- But you'll have to face the future.
- Face the future...</i>

12:43.956 --> 12:45.311
<i>... when the truth comes out.</i>

12:45.536 --> 12:47.235
<i>You're gonna miss it, Carla.</i>

12:47.236 --> 12:49.265
<i>You're gonna miss it 'round here.</i>

12:49.266 --> 12:51.004
<i>Gonna hurt him badly.</i>

12:51.216 --> 12:54.871
<i>But you can't stay away
for one whole year.</i>

12:55.049 --> 12:58.679
<i>- I know that I'm not crazy.
- Everything comes down to poo.</i>

12:58.680 --> 13:01.571
<i>- I think that I'm not crazy.
- When we move I'm gonna have...</i>

13:01.572 --> 13:02.941
<i>...  my own private loo.</i>

13:03.427 --> 13:06.896
<i>How am I supposed to tell him
that he's not moving too?</i>

13:06.897 --> 13:09.469
<i>- Oh my God.
- He doesn't have a clue.</i>

13:09.470 --> 13:11.226
<i>I'm crazy.</i>

13:11.227 --> 13:14.059
<i>If you like to reconsider,
I'd be glad to do my part.</i>

13:14.336 --> 13:22.383
<i>If you want your job is open,
come on back to Sacred Heart.</i>

13:24.376 --> 13:25.674
Look at the temporal lobe.

13:25.675 --> 13:27.312
That could be why
she's hearing music.

13:27.313 --> 13:28.857
The biggest aneurysm I've ever seen.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.274
The woman is a time-bomb.

13:30.730 --> 13:32.770
<i>Sometimes you're better off not knowing.</i>

13:32.946 --> 13:34.615
<i>But this isn't one of those times.</i>

13:34.756 --> 13:36.594
<i>Your world's become a musical.</i>

13:36.595 --> 13:38.338
<i>And your doctors speak in rhymes.</i>

13:38.506 --> 13:39.935
<i>It's best to know the truth.</i>

13:40.137 --> 13:41.876
<i>Of that we have no doubt.</i>

13:41.877 --> 13:46.158
<i>- But you'll have to face the future...
- How can I tell him?</i>

13:46.159 --> 13:49.700
<i>- How can I tell him?
- How can I tell her?</i>

13:49.701 --> 13:53.027
<i>You'll have to face the future
when the truth comes out.</i>

13:54.699 --> 13:57.936
<i>So Dr. Cox, is it serious?</i>

14:00.433 --> 14:02.450
Oh...

14:08.772 --> 14:13.638
<i>When the truth comes out.</i>

14:17.631 --> 14:18.824
Okay, we've to tell them.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.152
They're so close. Maybe they'll
help each other through it.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.512
Come on, Carla. They're guys.

14:22.550 --> 14:23.927
They're not gonna get all touchy-feely.

14:26.459 --> 14:29.375
<i>Let's face the facts
about me and you...</i>

14:29.566 --> 14:32.550
<i>... a love unspecified.</i>

14:32.722 --> 14:36.365
<i>Though I'm proud to
call you "Chocolate Bear",</i>

14:36.527 --> 14:40.110
<i>... the crowd will always
talk and stare.</i>

14:40.111 --> 14:43.385
<i>I feel exactly those feelings too.</i>

14:43.574 --> 14:46.318
<i>And that's why
I keep them inside.</i>

14:46.319 --> 14:50.051
<i>'Cause this bear can't bear
the world's disdain.</i>

14:50.464 --> 14:52.835
<i>And sometimes is easier to hide...</i>

14:52.836 --> 14:55.223
<i>- ... than explain our Guy Love.
- ... than explain our Guy Love.</i>

14:55.224 --> 14:57.032
<i>- That's all it is.
- That's all it is.</i>

14:57.428 --> 15:00.498
<i>- Guy Love, he's mine, I'm his.
- Guy Love, he's mine, I'm his.</i>

15:00.826 --> 15:03.139
<i>- There's nothing gay about it...
- There's nothing gay about it...</i>

15:03.312 --> 15:05.861
<i>- ... in our eyes.
- ... in our eyes.</i>

15:07.224 --> 15:10.750
<i>You ask me about this thing we share.</i>

15:10.751 --> 15:15.401
<i>And he tenderly replies.</i>

15:16.060 --> 15:17.634
<i>It's guy love...</i>

15:17.635 --> 15:21.920
<i>- ... between two guys.
- ... between two guys.</i>

15:22.870 --> 15:26.217
<i>We're closer than the
average man & wife.</i>

15:26.218 --> 15:29.395
<i>That's why our matching
bracelets say "Turk & JD"</i>

15:29.396 --> 15:33.192
<i>You know I'll stick by you
for the rest of my life.</i>

15:33.193 --> 15:37.120
<i>You're the only man
who's ever been inside of me.</i>

15:37.680 --> 15:39.206
I just took out his appendix.

15:39.747 --> 15:43.098
<i>- There's no need to clarify.
- Oh no?</i>

15:43.099 --> 15:45.964
<i>Just let it grow more
and more each day.</i>

15:47.020 --> 15:50.065
<i>It's like I married my best friend.</i>

15:50.066 --> 15:52.603
<i>But in a totally manly way.</i>

15:52.604 --> 15:53.636
<i>- Let's go.
- Let's go.</i>

15:53.637 --> 15:57.197
<i>- It's guy love, don't compromise...
- It's guy love, don't compromise...</i>

15:57.198 --> 16:00.643
<i>- ... the feeling of some other guy.
- ... the feeling of some other guy.</i>

16:00.848 --> 16:03.049
<i>- Holding up your heart...
- Holding up your heart...</i>

16:03.050 --> 16:05.985
<i>- ... into the sky.
- ... into the sky.</i>

16:07.393 --> 16:10.730
<i>I'll be there to care through all the lows.</i>

16:10.731 --> 16:15.322
<i>I'll be there to share the highs.</i>

16:15.643 --> 16:21.966
<i>- It's guy love between two guys.
- It's guy love between two guys.</i>

16:22.819 --> 16:25.896
<i>And when I say
"I love you, Turk".</i>

16:26.354 --> 16:31.082
<i>It's not what it implies.</i>

16:32.604 --> 16:35.232
<i>- It's guy love...
- It's guy love...</i>

16:35.647 --> 16:37.446
<i>- ... between...
- ... between...</i>

16:37.680 --> 16:39.956
<i>- ... two...
- ... two...</i>

16:41.268 --> 16:45.030
<i>- ... guys.
- ... guys.</i>

16:45.876 --> 16:47.210
No hands.

16:55.464 --> 16:56.919
Okay, I'll go first.

16:57.370 --> 16:59.101
JD, I wanna live by myself.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.787
Okay, no problem.

17:00.788 --> 17:02.669
Turk, will you relay this?

17:03.705 --> 17:05.499
That means you guys
are no longer talking.

17:05.500 --> 17:06.707
JD ?!

17:06.708 --> 17:08.770
Wait a second.
What did she mean she'll go first?

17:09.146 --> 17:11.463
Turk, I wanna come back to work.
It's who I am.

17:12.814 --> 17:15.891
I always thought family was the most
important thing to Puerto Ricans.

17:18.952 --> 17:22.392
<i>I've had it up to here
so let me make it very clear.</i>

17:22.607 --> 17:25.301
<i>Because I swear I'll never
hook you in again.</i>

17:25.824 --> 17:27.321
<i>Everytime that you profess... </i>

17:27.323 --> 17:29.119
<i>- ... I come from Puerto Rico.
- Yes.</i>

17:29.120 --> 17:32.361
<i>For the last time, Turk,
I'm Dominican.</i>

17:34.634 --> 17:37.927
<i>Don't make a big to-do,
I was simply testing you.</i>

17:38.106 --> 17:41.153
<i>Then why'd you tell JD
our baby is "Blaxican"?</i>

17:41.314 --> 17:42.934
<i>Baby, you know
I know the truth.</i>

17:43.096 --> 17:44.824
<i>Well, I need a little proof, so...</i>

17:44.825 --> 17:47.954
<i>... list all you know about me
or no sex again.</i>

17:48.132 --> 17:48.993
Let's see...

17:49.587 --> 17:51.386
<i>- Your name is Carla.
- Oh yes.</i>

17:51.387 --> 17:53.389
<i>- You are Latina.
- Impressive.</i>

17:53.390 --> 17:55.609
<i>You are a nurse,
your mother is dead and...</i>

17:55.610 --> 17:56.689
Wait !
I got it.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.405
<i>- Three sisters.
- Turk!!</i>

17:58.406 --> 17:59.600
<i>Two sisters?</i>

17:59.978 --> 18:03.549
<i>But I'm sure you have a brother
who is a huge jerkoff.</i>

18:03.550 --> 18:06.928
<i>- Tell me what's my middle name.
- Ok. I'm tired of this game.</i>

18:06.929 --> 18:08.516
<i>Let's forget it.
I give up.</i>

18:08.517 --> 18:09.827
<i>I guess you win again.</i>

18:10.047 --> 18:12.302
<i>But it's not just me who gets mixed up...</i>

18:12.303 --> 18:15.548
<i>- ...  by all this crazy ethnic stuff.
- Sorry. Even I know.</i>

18:15.729 --> 18:17.052
<i>She's Dominican.
Booya!</i>

18:17.053 --> 18:20.050
<i>Did I grow up in Illinois
or was it Michigan?</i>

18:20.946 --> 18:23.550
<i>How long before we met
was I in Medicine?</i>

18:24.066 --> 18:26.984
<i>Was our wedding song
The Beatles or Led Zepellin?</i>

18:27.435 --> 18:30.500
<i>Am I freakin' Puerto Rican
or Dominican?</i>

18:30.883 --> 18:33.622
<i>The thing is guys remember facts...</i>

18:33.969 --> 18:37.676
<i>... like what Derek Jeter hit
last year which was 303.</i>

18:37.677 --> 18:40.437
<i>And that is why
our brains are maxed.</i>

18:40.826 --> 18:44.690
<i>And there's no room for things
like birthdays or ethnicities.</i>

18:45.050 --> 18:46.383
<i>Well, thank you
for that glimpse...</i>

18:46.384 --> 18:48.295
<i>... into the workings of
the inner man.</i>

18:48.296 --> 18:49.741
<i>Let's talk about
your job and...</i>

18:49.743 --> 18:51.762
<i>- ... not the fact that you're...
- ... Dominican.</i>

18:51.763 --> 18:52.763
<i>You're not staying
home from work.</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:54.929
<i>Will that make
you happy, Turk?</i>

18:54.930 --> 18:57.750
<i>I'll support you if you
choose to earn the Benjamins.</i>

18:58.197 --> 18:59.956
<i>Then I'll return to work today.</i>

19:00.126 --> 19:01.706
<i>Now you showed
that that's okay.</i>

19:01.851 --> 19:04.621
<i>I say "si" which is
"yes" in Dominican.</i>

19:05.017 --> 19:06.580
<i>- And Puerto Rican.
- Turk!!!</i>

19:06.581 --> 19:08.308
<i>But you're Dominican.</i>

19:09.779 --> 19:10.803
Look, JD.

19:11.395 --> 19:13.761
I don't wanna let you down
when your life is so crappy.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.868
- Move in with me.
- No, Elliot. It's okay.

19:17.869 --> 19:19.876
I was just feeling
sorry for myself.

19:19.877 --> 19:21.745
Plus, it's about time
you lived on your own.

19:21.746 --> 19:23.507
You're closer to 40 than 30.

19:24.242 --> 19:25.555
JD, I'm 29.

19:25.556 --> 19:27.020
I'm playing with you.
Listen.

19:27.021 --> 19:28.859
We're gonna be fine.
You know why?

19:29.242 --> 19:33.552
<i>We'll be friends forever.</i>

19:33.553 --> 19:35.521
<i>We're gonna be
friends forever.</i>

19:35.522 --> 19:39.181
<i>We will always be true.</i>

19:39.674 --> 19:43.459
<i>Friends forever.
We're gonna be friends forever.</i>

19:43.888 --> 19:46.878
<i>I'll always be there for you.</i>

19:47.733 --> 19:51.553
<i>- We're as close as...
- ... the vena cava and the aorta.</i>

19:51.726 --> 19:55.410
<i>- We're best friends just like...
- ... amoxacilin and clavulanic acid.</i>

19:55.411 --> 19:57.342
<i>The tibia and the fibula.
The left and right ventricule.</i>

19:57.343 --> 19:59.371
<i>A hypodermic needle
and a latex tourniquet.</i>

19:59.372 --> 20:01.312
<i>Diverticulitis and
a barium enema.</i>

20:01.313 --> 20:05.460
<i>- The vena cava and the aorta.
- Amoxacilin and clavulanic acid.</i>

20:05.461 --> 20:07.307
<i>The tibia, the fibula.
The left and right ventricule.</i>

20:07.308 --> 20:09.330
<i>A hypodermic needle
and a latex tourniquet.</i>

20:09.331 --> 20:11.403
<i>- The vena cava and the aorta.
- We'll be friends...</i>

20:11.404 --> 20:13.449
<i>- Amoxacilin and clavulanic acid.
- ... forever.</i>

20:13.450 --> 20:15.364
<i>The tibia, the fibula.
The left and right ventricule.</i>

20:15.365 --> 20:16.942
<i>A hypodermic needle and a...</i>

20:19.906 --> 20:21.719
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

20:22.495 --> 20:24.696
<i>What does the future hold?</i>

20:24.697 --> 20:27.576
<i>So many things that I put off.</i>

20:28.049 --> 20:35.218
<i>Assuming I'd have time.
Assuming I'd grow old.</i>

20:37.007 --> 20:38.768
<i>What's going to happen?</i>

20:39.954 --> 20:43.768
<i>And will I be alive tomorrow?</i>

20:45.024 --> 20:46.665
<i>What's going to happen...</i>

20:47.561 --> 20:52.466
<i>... to me?</i>

20:53.039 --> 20:55.232
<i>You're going to be okay.</i>

20:55.565 --> 20:57.899
<i>That's what's going to happen.</i>

20:58.235 --> 21:02.131
<i>Everything is okay.</i>

21:02.501 --> 21:04.979
<i>We're right here beside you.</i>

21:04.980 --> 21:07.377
<i>We won't let you slip away.</i>

21:08.015 --> 21:11.275
<i>Plan for tomorrow.</i>

21:11.900 --> 21:14.251
<i>'Cause we swear to you...</i>

21:14.719 --> 21:20.045
<i>... you're going to be okay.</i>

21:21.821 --> 21:24.020
<i>I'm going to be okay.</i>

21:24.762 --> 21:26.713
<i>That's what's going to happen.</i>

21:27.067 --> 21:31.775
<i>- Everything is okay.
- Everything is okay.</i>

21:31.776 --> 21:36.154
<i>We will never leave you.
Right here we will stay.</i>

21:36.541 --> 21:39.745
<i>- Plan for tomorrow.
- Plan for tomorrow.</i>

21:40.760 --> 21:43.534
<i>'Cause we swear to you...</i>

21:43.535 --> 21:48.534
<i>... you're going to be okay.</i>

21:50.362 --> 21:51.899
We hope.

22:00.196 --> 22:01.758
Did it work?

22:02.019 --> 22:03.553
You're gonna have to tell us.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.653
Thank you.

22:11.284 --> 22:12.896
By the way,
who's the best singer?

22:13.273 --> 22:14.810
You know,
in your head.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.336
Don't let the fact that
I went to theater camp...

22:17.337 --> 22:18.501
... affect your decision.

22:18.867 --> 22:21.049
<i>In musicals, there's
always a happy ending.</i>

22:21.395 --> 22:22.466
<i>But in life, </i>

22:23.082 --> 22:25.107
<i>... sometimes when you
get what you want,</i>

22:25.998 --> 22:28.009
<i>... you end up missing
what you left behind.</i>

22:30.614 --> 22:32.173
<i>Whether it's your roommate...</i>

22:34.149 --> 22:35.463
I'll see you in a little while.

22:36.937 --> 22:38.623
<i>... or time spent with your child.</i>

22:42.291 --> 22:46.570
<i>Or even the music you
used to hear in your head.</i>
