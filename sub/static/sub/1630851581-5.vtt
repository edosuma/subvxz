Hello? Yeah. Gonna need
a dumpster in section 4.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.556
Hello? Hello?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.857
Oh, this phone!
These phones these days!

01:13.490 --> 01:15.617
(Honking)

01:17.369 --> 01:20.706
Dad! I gonna be late!
My friends are waiting for me.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.250
I'll be right there, Mikey.
Just a sec!

01:23.250 --> 01:27.045
‐ Business again?
‐ Uh, yeah... Business.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.549
(Honking)

01:32.217 --> 01:34.011
It's cool. I'll just walk.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.681
‐ (Phone rings)
‐ Collins here.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.894
Sure thing. I wouldn't miss
the unveiling for the world!

01:52.696 --> 01:55.615
I don't get how you can spend
so much time playing that game.

01:55.615 --> 01:58.702
It helps me strategize
and hones my reflexes.

01:58.702 --> 02:01.913
And the game design is state
of the art. You gotta try it!

02:02.664 --> 02:05.584
What we got going on today?
Wanna chow down at Roland's?

02:05.584 --> 02:07.878
‐ Back of the net.
‐ Seriously?

02:07.878 --> 02:10.255
Playing <i>Spook Out</i> again?

02:10.255 --> 02:12.466
That game is like a virus!

02:12.466 --> 02:15.093
‐ (Mutters)
‐ Check it out!

02:15.093 --> 02:17.929
Some newbie called
The Slammer just joined.

02:17.929 --> 02:21.099
And he's real good! He's already
ranking in the top three.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.227
I bet he'll knock Sir
Spooks‐A‐Lot out of first place.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.938
He can try.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.484
‐ Sir Spooks‐A‐Lot, huh?
‐ Seriously, dude?

02:30.484 --> 02:34.446
‐ You're Sir ‐‐
‐ OK, it's me. But, shh!

02:34.446 --> 02:37.282
Hold up!
That means you're famous!

02:37.282 --> 02:39.618
‐ Like father, like son!
‐ Yeah, right.

02:39.618 --> 02:42.329
You know me and my dad
live on two different planets.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.460
I swear, an actual TV
right on the edge of the swamp.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.837
Score! Huh? Aw, man!

03:01.556 --> 03:03.600
Boo!

03:03.600 --> 03:05.477
Zip zap.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.230
Zip zap.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.525
BOTH: Zip zap.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.194
Zip zap.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.828
Look out!

03:23.453 --> 03:24.996
Whoa!

03:27.707 --> 03:29.418
BOTH: Zip zap.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.879
Is it just me or did a fish
just jump into Drake's phone?

03:32.879 --> 03:35.507
Forget video games!
This spookout's gone live!

03:35.507 --> 03:37.551
Let's go, Ghost Force!

03:37.551 --> 03:40.178
Uh, can I finish my level first?

03:41.555 --> 03:44.057
<i>Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow!</i>

03:49.521 --> 03:50.730
Fury!

03:51.523 --> 03:53.024
Krush!

03:54.526 --> 03:55.569
Myst!

03:59.531 --> 04:00.949
Ghost Force!

04:09.332 --> 04:12.294
‐ Yo, Miss Jones! Got any intel?
‐ Indeed.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.464
You're dealing with
a level‐four hypno‐electro ghost

04:15.464 --> 04:17.466
called Zip Zap.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.927
And things will really spark
off if it engages its boosters.

04:20.927 --> 04:25.182
So you better catch that tadpole
before it's too late!

04:25.182 --> 04:28.560
‐ And don't look at the screens!
‐ The only way we can catch it

04:28.560 --> 04:30.687
is when it's jumping
between screens!

04:30.687 --> 04:32.481
Slammer's climbing the ranks!

04:32.481 --> 04:34.900
You couldn't let me
just finish my level!

04:34.900 --> 04:38.069
In case you hadn't noticed,
we've got a real‐life problem!

04:48.413 --> 04:49.664
Zip Zap.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.338
‐ Krush, ready a Boo‐Cap!
‐ Oh, right!

05:12.604 --> 05:14.773
Oh, no! No!

05:14.773 --> 05:16.441
Krush!

05:23.532 --> 05:26.660
What's your deal? Zip Zap was
diving straight for your screen!

05:26.660 --> 05:29.246
But Slammer
just beat my high score!

05:29.246 --> 05:31.581
Really?
That's what's bugging you?

05:31.581 --> 05:33.834
We were this close
to catching the ghost

05:33.834 --> 05:36.711
‐ until you dropped the ball!
‐ Hey! That's it!

05:36.711 --> 05:39.631
You need to
get off that game now!

05:39.631 --> 05:42.092
Any idea how long it took me
to get to number one?

05:42.092 --> 05:45.011
‐ That's still no reason!
‐ Kids, problems are coming.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.139
Zip Zap is heading straight
for Times Square, so get to it!

05:56.731 --> 05:59.609
Could you tell us a little bit
about your new Collins Kicks?

05:59.609 --> 06:01.736
Of course.
It's a totally new design

06:01.736 --> 06:04.322
inspired by someone
very special to me.

06:04.739 --> 06:07.534
‐ My son, Mike.
‐ (Cheering)

06:15.000 --> 06:16.376
Already?

06:18.628 --> 06:22.215
1,682 points?
How am I ever gonna beat that?

06:22.215 --> 06:24.467
Forget about it!
This is an emergency!

06:24.467 --> 06:25.176
Huh?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.473
Dad?

06:42.694 --> 06:46.364
‐ Gnaa!
‐ Zip Zap.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.450
Dad?

06:48.450 --> 06:51.620
‐ Zip Zap.
‐ No! Not you too!

06:51.620 --> 06:54.539
(Evil laugh)

06:54.539 --> 06:57.167
Gotta get away from the screens.
Onwards and upwards!

07:11.473 --> 07:14.684
Er, Miss Jones? Zip Zap's
activating booster mode.

07:14.684 --> 07:17.145
‐ And his eyes...
‐ I see.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.606
Boo's energy spike
speaks for itself.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.358
Careful.
Don't look at it in the eyes!

07:25.320 --> 07:25.987
Aaah!

07:34.371 --> 07:35.580
(Battle cry)

07:37.749 --> 07:38.750
Aaah!

07:40.460 --> 07:41.670
Oh, no! Krush!

07:42.712 --> 07:44.923
Spectral gate!

07:48.259 --> 07:52.555
FURY: I thought anchovies...
were a lot...

07:52.555 --> 07:54.182
smaller than this thing!

07:55.475 --> 07:58.311
And they definitely
don't belong on pizza.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.650
Zip Zap.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.651
You gotta be kidding me.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.781
No!

08:09.781 --> 08:11.324
Aaah!

08:11.324 --> 08:13.159
Zip Zap.

08:19.708 --> 08:20.834
Oh, no! Myst!

08:24.713 --> 08:26.423
Uh‐oh!

08:30.051 --> 08:33.638
Miss Jones! Fury and Myst just
got zip‐zapped! And my dad too!

08:33.638 --> 08:36.599
I could've saved them if my eyes
weren't glued to my game.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.436
<i>Keep it together!</i>
<i>You can handle this, Mike.</i>

08:39.436 --> 08:42.480
How?
I can't even look at Zip Zap,

08:42.480 --> 08:44.274
so forget about
covering its eyes!

08:44.816 --> 08:46.317
Don't worry. I have an idea!

08:48.903 --> 08:52.073
I'm sending you
a gadget I just DIYed right now.

08:57.579 --> 09:00.290
‐ I can't see anything!
‐ Cool, huh?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.583
With my Viseo‐Ghost,

09:01.833 --> 09:04.085
Zip Zap
can't hypnotise me via video,

09:04.085 --> 09:07.714
which means I can be your eyes
while you fight. Ready?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.840
‐ Let's go!
‐ Uh...

09:15.680 --> 09:19.517
It's just there! Too far!
it's just behind you!

09:19.517 --> 09:21.770
It's on your left! Left! Right!

09:21.770 --> 09:23.855
Throttle back!
Evasive manoeuvres.

09:23.855 --> 09:27.525
Further to the right!
Under! No! On your side!

09:28.109 --> 09:31.488
I said right!
Target's off‐screen!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.281
Oh, where did it go?
Where did it go?

09:36.451 --> 09:38.495
Look up above you!

09:42.040 --> 09:44.375
‐ Uh... a little help here?
‐ Did you get it?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.668
‐ No!
‐ Focus, Krush!

09:46.503 --> 09:50.298
I'm trying, but it's the worst
video‐game walk through!

09:50.298 --> 09:51.466
I need clearer instructions!

09:52.717 --> 09:54.844
Oh, my bad! Got it!

09:54.844 --> 09:58.598
‐ D‐pad to the left!
‐ Oh, now I get it!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.686
‐ Ready, Miss Jones?
‐ Ready!

10:05.855 --> 10:09.359
MS JONES: <i>Down and left! Spin up</i>
<i>and joystick to the right!</i>

10:09.359 --> 10:10.735
<i>Ooh, yeah! That's a nice combo!</i>

10:11.653 --> 10:13.279
<i>Upward dodge!</i>

10:13.905 --> 10:15.615
And fire straight ahead!

10:19.619 --> 10:21.246
Yeah! Finally!

10:21.871 --> 10:23.832
And you know the rest.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.171
Grow max!

10:49.482 --> 10:50.150
Aaah!

11:08.293 --> 11:10.712
What happened?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.297
Huh? What's going on?

11:20.638 --> 11:24.184
Hey, Dad, too much screen time
isn't good for the brain.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.478
You're right son, but...
I'm totally hooked on Spook‐Out.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.106
Downloaded it yesterday
and can't stop playing.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.817
I even have an alias,
The Slammer!

11:32.817 --> 11:35.069
The... the... the Slammer?

11:35.069 --> 11:38.573
Yeah. What do you say we have
a father‐son spook‐out tonight?

11:38.573 --> 11:42.660
Actually, my eyes
need a little offline time.

11:42.660 --> 11:46.915
‐ Maybe we can just hang out?
‐ You got yourself a deal!

11:52.587 --> 11:55.590
That's big grin tells me you
worked things out with your dad!

11:55.590 --> 11:59.385
Uh‐huh! And get this!
I'm hanging out with my dad!

11:59.385 --> 12:02.222
Hanging out with Mr Collins?
I'm so there!

12:04.641 --> 12:09.312
Or... I guess I'll just
hang out with my own dad!

12:09.312 --> 12:10.897
Yeah.

12:16.653 --> 12:19.489
Gather round, ladies and gents,

12:19.489 --> 12:22.617
for a free sample of my new
Independence Day hot dog!

12:23.826 --> 12:25.370
Ow!

12:40.009 --> 12:42.637
I can't believe
it's finally happening, sis!

12:42.637 --> 12:45.598
We're spending Independence Day
in New York City!

12:45.598 --> 12:48.017
Yeah. Heard ya
the first 27 times.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.396
Mom and Dad always told us
it's the greatest show on earth!

12:51.396 --> 12:53.856
Hey, Mike,
what sights should we see today?

12:53.856 --> 12:58.236
‐ Well, we could ‐‐
‐ Check out Roland's BBQ!

12:59.279 --> 13:00.989
‐ OK, there's that.
‐ (Chuckles)

13:00.989 --> 13:04.450
Well, I wanna know
what's totally must‐see,

13:04.450 --> 13:05.576
besides hot dogs!

13:06.160 --> 13:09.414
There's so much to do,
like parades and games,

13:09.414 --> 13:12.542
but the biggest must‐see
is tonight's fireworks show

13:12.542 --> 13:15.586
‐ on the Brooklyn Bridge!
‐ I can't wait to see it!

13:15.586 --> 13:17.672
Don't ya just love summer vacay?

13:17.672 --> 13:20.758
Just think, we don't have to see
Prof Pascal for another ‐‐

13:20.758 --> 13:24.887
‐ Hello there, kids!
‐ Professor Pascal?

13:24.887 --> 13:27.849
‐ What are you doing here?
‐ Just prepping a few rockets

13:27.849 --> 13:29.559
for the fireworks show tonight.

13:29.559 --> 13:33.479
Wow. Who knew teachers
had lives outside of school?

13:33.479 --> 13:36.524
Ha, ha!
Pyrotechnics are my side‐gig.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.818
So, curious how fireworks work?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.653
‐ Totally!
‐ All right.

13:40.653 --> 13:41.821
Open your notebooks!

13:42.447 --> 13:45.575
Fireworks were invented
in 10th‐century China.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.203
Originally, they used black
powder composed of sulphur,

13:49.203 --> 13:50.747
potassium nitrate and charcoal.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.498
Whoa!

13:52.957 --> 13:57.754
So any aspiring pyrotechnic must
be focused and very careful!

14:02.550 --> 14:03.760
Oh, no!

14:09.724 --> 14:14.604
‐ Oh, Andy!
‐ Uh... oops? Sorry, Roland!

14:14.604 --> 14:16.814
Focused and careful,
you were saying?

14:21.652 --> 14:23.571
(Evil laugh)

14:29.285 --> 14:30.495
Aaah!

14:31.454 --> 14:33.498
‐ Aaah!
‐ (Evil laugh)

14:34.415 --> 14:36.542
Oh, get to safety, kids!

14:36.542 --> 14:37.752
Huh?

14:40.630 --> 14:44.467
‐ Ms Jones, we've got ‐‐
‐ <i>Move your booties!</i>

14:44.467 --> 14:47.512
<i>We've got a level‐4 ghost</i>
<i>and it's called Flame.</i>

14:47.512 --> 14:50.932
<i>One of the fastest I've ever</i>
<i>seen, and I've seen plenty.</i>

14:50.932 --> 14:54.477
Fast, huh?
Sounds like a challenge.

14:54.477 --> 14:57.480
<i>You must capture it</i>
<i>before it merges with anything</i>

14:57.480 --> 15:00.566
<i>or that firecracker</i>
<i>will become even more feisty!</i>

15:00.566 --> 15:04.112
<i>And then we can forget about</i>
<i>Independence Day!</i>

15:04.112 --> 15:06.906
We'll plug that walking
exhaust pipe, Ms Jones.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.866
Let's go, Ghost Force!

15:09.617 --> 15:12.328
<i>Ghost Force,</i>
<i>don't fear the glow!</i>

15:17.875 --> 15:19.210
Fury!

15:20.211 --> 15:21.254
Krush!

15:22.630 --> 15:24.173
Myst!

15:27.426 --> 15:28.636
Ghost Force!

15:30.346 --> 15:32.306
‐ Aaah!
‐ Ha, ha!

15:34.016 --> 15:37.186
Let's coordinate.
Krush, Fury, you ‐‐ Fury!

15:38.271 --> 15:40.273
Think you're fast? Race ya!

15:47.488 --> 15:50.283
(Straining)

15:50.992 --> 15:56.247
‐ Hold up, Fury! We need a plan!
‐ It's cool, I've got this!

15:56.247 --> 15:58.583
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

16:02.461 --> 16:03.754
Aaah! Aaah! Aaah!

16:05.298 --> 16:06.215
Ha, ha!

16:10.595 --> 16:12.513
(Sighs)
I'll lead it towards you.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.269
(Groans)

16:26.611 --> 16:28.321
Surprise!

16:32.491 --> 16:33.659
Ah!

16:43.544 --> 16:44.503
Uh‐oh!

16:47.506 --> 16:48.716
Aaah!

16:59.393 --> 17:02.521
<i>Why is there</i>
<i>a sudden spike in Boo energy?</i>

17:02.521 --> 17:05.608
<i>It's like Flame merged</i>
<i>with an energy source.</i>

17:05.608 --> 17:09.904
<i>‐ It hasn't done that, right?</i>
‐ Uh, kinda... with a rocket.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.949
<i>Aaah!</i>
<i>I thought we said no merging!</i>

17:12.949 --> 17:15.409
Argh!
I was so close to nailing it!

17:15.409 --> 17:18.079
If we had coordinated,
we could've nailed it.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.539
It doesn't stand a chance
against us as a team!

17:20.539 --> 17:22.959
No time to lose!
I'm sending GlowBoo

17:22.959 --> 17:25.002
as soon as
he's finished recharging.

17:25.002 --> 17:30.550
Almost 97% done!
Oh, wait, 97% remaining. OK...

17:30.550 --> 17:33.719
‐ Anyway, he'll be there soon!
‐ Not if I get that ghost first!

17:33.719 --> 17:35.555
(Sighs)

17:40.309 --> 17:41.727
Aaah!

17:44.564 --> 17:45.982
(Evil laugh)

17:46.857 --> 17:48.276
Watch your step!

17:54.448 --> 17:55.366
This time we're ready!

17:55.908 --> 17:57.159
Got him in my sights!

17:58.911 --> 18:00.538
Flexy Blast!

18:01.998 --> 18:03.040
Oh, no!

18:14.760 --> 18:17.054
I was going to
neutralise its horns.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.558
‐ What were you thinking?
‐ I didn't see your arrow.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.935
Ugh! Just don't make
that mistake again!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.645
The city's counting on us!

18:24.645 --> 18:27.398
Yeah, next time,
think before you sprint!

18:27.398 --> 18:29.400
You're right.
I'll be more careful.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.985
Well, what are you waiting for?

18:30.985 --> 18:33.487
Flame is heading
towards the bridge.

18:33.487 --> 18:36.907
And people are already gathering
there for tonight's show!

18:40.870 --> 18:42.913
Recharged and at your service.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.628
(Laughter and good cheer)

18:48.628 --> 18:51.088
That Flame's gotta be
around here somewhere.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.927
(Evil laugh)

19:05.936 --> 19:08.439
We gotta act fast!
I'll evac the crowd.

19:08.439 --> 19:11.317
‐ You handle Flame.
‐ I will keep him busy.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.700
(Screaming)

19:25.456 --> 19:26.666
(Laughter)

19:27.708 --> 19:30.795
Fury, you're on defence. Keep
between Flame and the bridge.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.839
Krush, go on the attack
as soon as you get a chance.

19:33.839 --> 19:39.053
Got it! This time no mistakes.
Not even minor boo‐boos!

19:43.516 --> 19:45.101
(Screaming)

19:49.522 --> 19:51.440
Please file out calmly!

19:51.857 --> 19:53.526
(Gasps)

19:54.652 --> 19:57.238
OK, maybe a bit quicker.
I can't keep this open for long!

20:00.783 --> 20:02.868
Mayday. Error detected.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.292
Unbelievable!
Not even a scratch!

20:10.292 --> 20:11.127
Grr!

20:16.257 --> 20:18.175
Looks like your rockets
are duds, dude!

20:18.551 --> 20:19.719
Aaah!

20:20.886 --> 20:22.096
Uh‐oh!

20:22.680 --> 20:24.557
I may require an update.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.519
Aw, man!

20:28.894 --> 20:30.354
Aaah!

20:37.486 --> 20:39.196
And home run!

20:42.241 --> 20:43.159
Careful, Fury.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.744
Myst! Heads‐up!

20:57.173 --> 20:59.133
Ha! That's his weak spot!

21:02.261 --> 21:03.220
Urgh, not now!

21:13.564 --> 21:15.733
‐ Myst!
‐ Fury, take her somewhere safe,

21:15.733 --> 21:17.067
quick!

21:22.907 --> 21:24.200
Phew!

21:30.664 --> 21:33.626
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have
left the bridge defenceless.

21:33.626 --> 21:36.462
But Krush was getting pummelled!

21:36.462 --> 21:38.088
Saving people is what we do,

21:38.088 --> 21:41.592
but now you've only made
the whole sitch worse!

21:41.592 --> 21:45.387
At least you got our point,
which is a good start.

21:45.387 --> 21:46.680
Anyway, let's focus.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.682
I think I know
how to defeat Flame.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.393
We gotta make his rockets
fire back at him.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.312
Got it and already love it!

21:54.480 --> 21:55.231
Fury...

21:56.273 --> 21:58.192
Ah, yeah... A plan!

22:04.949 --> 22:07.451
Wait, Fury!
You can't handle this alone!

22:07.451 --> 22:10.246
I know. Get ready
to freeze it in its tracks!

22:13.749 --> 22:16.877
Yo, BBQ‐breath, got anything
else you wanna throw at me?

22:26.929 --> 22:28.180
Fractal Trap!

22:30.432 --> 22:33.143
You may be fast,
but I got the brains.

22:45.406 --> 22:46.282
Boo‐yah!

22:48.659 --> 22:49.910
Dragoyle!

23:00.546 --> 23:02.256
(Battle cry)

23:23.319 --> 23:24.570
Boo‐yah!

23:24.570 --> 23:26.488
Boo... zazaza... yah!

23:34.622 --> 23:36.999
You were right, Mike,
this is even better

23:36.999 --> 23:39.501
‐ than Roland's new hot dog.
‐ Yes!

23:39.501 --> 23:42.338
Whoa! Ho, ho!
Oh, look at that one!

23:42.338 --> 23:43.380
(Crash)

23:45.591 --> 23:48.344
Oops! Oh, I think I'll take
the rest of the summer off.

23:49.386 --> 23:59.396
(Chuckling)
