WEBVTT

00:00.067 --> 00:01.469
PREVIOUSLY ON
"CHASING LIFE"

00:01.502 --> 00:03.303
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
LET GO OF THE IDEA

00:03.337 --> 00:04.572
THAT THIS WILL
EVER BE NORMAL.

00:04.605 --> 00:07.474
IT'S KIND OF WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT IT.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.509
Aaron:
ARE YOU TWO DATING?

00:08.541 --> 00:10.111
- WE USED TO.
- BUT IT'S OVER NOW?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.512
- TOTALLY?
- YES.

00:11.544 --> 00:13.714
- Sarah: PRESS CHARGES?
- THIS IS EXACTLY

00:13.747 --> 00:15.682
WHAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT
WHEN WE DECIDED

00:15.715 --> 00:17.451
THE GIRLS SHOULD STOP
SEEING EACH OTHER.

00:17.484 --> 00:19.687
YOU MUST BE EXCITED.
I MEAN, NEW JOB, NEW CITY.

00:19.719 --> 00:21.588
WE'LL SEE.
SO MANY GREAT THINGS
THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO ME

00:21.621 --> 00:23.157
HAVE COME
AS A COMPLETE SURPRISE.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.326
Beth:
AH, YOUR ROOM'S THAT WAY,

00:25.359 --> 00:26.493
KITCHEN'S THERE.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.730
YOUR GIRLFRIEND
IS ONE LUCKY WOMAN.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.164
I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.033
THEN I GUESS
I'M THE LUCKY ONE.

00:38.405 --> 00:40.341
Beth:
STOP WHAT YOU'RE DOING

00:40.374 --> 00:42.243
AND STEP AWAY FROM
ONE ANOTHER RIGHT NOW.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.512
THIS CANNOT HAPPEN.
NO.

00:45.545 --> 00:47.180
- NO, COMING THROUGH.
- ( Natalie laughs )

00:47.213 --> 00:48.816
EXCUSE ME,
THANK YOU.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.218
WHOA, CAN'T TWO STRANGERS
MAKE OUT PUBLICLY IN PRIVATE?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.719
- ( sighs )
- BETH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:52.753 --> 00:54.621
WHAT? YOU TWO
KNOW EACH OTHER?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.689
YEAH, LET ME INTRODUCE
YOU GUYS. UH...

00:56.723 --> 00:58.192
NATALIE,
THIS IS DOMINIC,

00:58.225 --> 01:00.127
APRIL'S EX.
DOMINIC,

01:00.161 --> 01:02.630
THIS IS NATALIE,
APRIL'S HALF-SISTER

01:02.662 --> 01:03.530
- AND MY NEW ROOMMATE.
- OH.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.132
( laughing )
I'M LIKE DYING.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.301
- THIS IS HILARIOUS.
- Graham: OH.

01:07.334 --> 01:10.638
SO THAT-- WHOA.
BUT WHY-- WO--

01:10.670 --> 01:12.239
YIKES.

01:12.272 --> 01:13.641
I SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE SURPRISED.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.775
I MEAN, IF YOU MAKE OUT
WITH EVERY GIRL ON THE PLANET,

01:15.810 --> 01:18.311
YOU'LL EVENTUALLY STUMBLE
ACROSS SOME RELATIVES.

01:18.344 --> 01:21.248
- RIGHT?
- I THOUGHT YOU
LOOKED FAMILIAR.

01:21.281 --> 01:23.082
I SAW YOUR PICTURE ONCE.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.685
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE ARE GOING

01:24.718 --> 01:26.085
TO GO AND GET A TABLE.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.355
BUT, YOU TWO,

01:28.388 --> 01:31.091
AND I MEAN IT, NO!

01:31.125 --> 01:32.759
OFF.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.527
BAD.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.164
ALL RIGHT.

01:41.301 --> 01:43.236
- ( both laugh )
- OH, NO.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.472
( laughs )

01:46.606 --> 01:49.676
WELL, I, UH, GUESS
IT'S A GOOD THING

01:49.710 --> 01:51.110
BETH GOT HERE
WHEN SHE DID.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.414
YOU KNOW, THINGS COULD
HAVE GOTTEN... AWKWARD.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.481
( laughs )

01:54.515 --> 01:56.115
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

01:56.150 --> 01:57.317
AND I DON'T DO AWKWARD.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.620
UM...

01:59.652 --> 02:01.254
THANKS...

02:01.287 --> 02:02.856
FOR, UH, HELPING ME OUT.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.825
- IT'S FINE.
- YEAH, UM...

02:07.194 --> 02:08.662
( chuckles )

02:08.695 --> 02:10.264
( giggles )

02:13.667 --> 02:16.903
- HEY.
- OH, UH, HI.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.173
BETH'S EX-ROOMMATE
TOOK THE WASHER AND DRYER

02:19.205 --> 02:20.441
WHEN SHE MOVED OUT.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.610
BRENNA SAID IT'D BE OKAY
IF I STOPPED BY

02:22.643 --> 02:23.811
- WHENEVER TO DO MINE.
- YEAH.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.712
HELP YOURSELF.
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY
TO WORK.

02:28.581 --> 02:31.384
AH, YOU TOTALLY
GOT SOME LAST NIGHT,

02:31.418 --> 02:33.253
- DIDN'T YOU?
- EXCUSE ME?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.855
KNOWING WHEN PEOPLE
GOT ACTION IS, LIKE,
MY SIXTH SENSE.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.324
I GUESS THAT MEANS

02:37.358 --> 02:38.759
COMA DUDE'S YOU-KNOW-WHAT
STILL WORKS.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.527
WHOO! THAT WOULD'VE
BEEN A DOWNER.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.562
LITERALLY.

02:41.594 --> 02:44.899
UH, LEO AND I
DIDN'T DO IT.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.634
HIS CARETAKER PETE

02:46.667 --> 02:48.635
DECIDED HE'D RATHER
SAVOR NURSE JACKIE

02:48.668 --> 02:50.471
THAN BINGE WATCH, SO...

02:50.503 --> 02:52.573
WE DID HAVE SOME FUN.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.574
HMM, WELL, WE MISSED
YOU AT THE CHARLES.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.676
- WE?
- BETH WAS THERE.

02:56.710 --> 02:57.711
AND, OH MY GOD, OKAY.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.778
SO YOU WANT TO HEAR
THE CRAZIEST,

02:58.812 --> 03:00.313
MOST RANDOM THING EVER?

03:00.347 --> 03:02.415
IT'S LIKE SO WEIRD.
YOU'RE GONNA LAUGH.

03:02.449 --> 03:05.686
I KIND OF MADE OUT
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

03:05.718 --> 03:07.655
I'M S-- DOMINIC?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.556
YOU'RE NOT LAUGHING.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.292
UH, OH, LOOK.

03:11.324 --> 03:12.659
I HAD NO IDEA
WHO HE WAS.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.562
I WAS ONLY TRYING TO GET
THAT ANNOYING BARTENDER,

03:14.594 --> 03:15.962
TIEGE, OFF MY BACK.

03:16.195 --> 03:17.764
AND I JUST GRABBED
THE CUTEST GUY THAT
I COULD FIND.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.733
BETH EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.870
- OKAY.
- IT WAS TOTALLY RANDOM.

03:22.902 --> 03:24.604
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.574
YOU'VE GOT LIKE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

03:26.606 --> 03:30.411
AND COME ON,
HALF-SISTERS BEFORE MISTERS.

03:30.443 --> 03:31.778

GREAT JOB WITH
THE CANCER BENEFIT ARTICLE.

04:09.682 --> 04:11.651
I REALLY THINK
AARON'S GONNA LIKE IT.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.586
OH, THANKS.
I HOPE SO.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.290
AND IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU WERE ABLE TO FINISH IN TIME

04:16.322 --> 04:17.790
TO GO MAKE OUT
WITH MY HALF-SISTER.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.660
( gulps, coughs )

04:19.692 --> 04:20.827
SORRY.

04:20.860 --> 04:22.329
COULDN'T RESIST.

04:22.362 --> 04:23.596
HOW'D YOU FIND OUT?

04:23.630 --> 04:25.699
NATALIE TOLD ME.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.567
SHE'S VERY OPEN.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.737
YEAH, WELL, IT WAS
AN HONEST MISTAKE.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.437
I HAD NO IDEA
WHO SHE WAS.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.473
- I SWEAR.
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN YOURSELF,

04:33.507 --> 04:34.774
EVEN THOUGH YOU DID
SEE A PICTURE OF HER

04:34.807 --> 04:36.543
THAT DAY WE WENT
TO MY DAD'S STORAGE UNIT.

04:36.576 --> 04:37.577
- BUT...
- WELL, YOU KNOW,

04:37.610 --> 04:38.612
A LOT'S HAPPENED
SINCE THEN.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.812
YEAH.
( laughs )

04:39.846 --> 04:42.483
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO MAKE OUT
WITH WHOEVER YOU WANT.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.917
- ( elevator dings )
- YEAH, I KNOW.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.653
- ( door opens )
- ( people chatter )

04:46.687 --> 04:49.656
THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR IS
ALL ABOUT NEW BEGINNINGS.

04:49.689 --> 04:51.492
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY
TO GROW...

04:51.524 --> 04:53.427
GROW AS
AN INDIVIDUAL.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.829
MOM, YOU GIVE ME
THE SAME SPEECH
EVERY SEPTEMBER.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.898
WELL, IT'S STILL
A GOOD SPEECH.

04:57.930 --> 05:01.502
AND ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATE
FOR YOU THIS YEAR.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.803
HOW ARE YOU FEELING
ABOUT ALL THAT?

05:03.836 --> 05:05.872
YOU STILL NERVOUS
FOR THE FIRST DAY?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.841
AH, SEEING GREER IS
GONNA BE A LITTLE AWKWARD,

05:08.875 --> 05:10.843
BUT LUCKILY I DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

05:10.877 --> 05:12.846
BEING IN ANY
OF HER A.P. CLASSES.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.548
MY LACK OF AMBITION
HAS FINALLY PAID OFF.

05:15.581 --> 05:17.050
- RIGHT?
- WELL, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE BEING MATURE

05:17.084 --> 05:19.052
ABOUT EVERYTHING,
BUT, YOU KNOW, BRENNA,

05:19.086 --> 05:20.553
MAYBE IT'S TIME
YOU TOOK SCHOOL

05:20.586 --> 05:22.555
A LITTLE MORE SERIOUSLY
NOW THAT YOU'RE A JUNIOR.

05:22.588 --> 05:23.891
CHANGE IS GOOD.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.725
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
WHY DON'T I JUST GET

05:25.759 --> 05:27.427
MY G.E.D. AND MOVE
TO SAN FRANCISCO

05:27.461 --> 05:28.461
WITH UNCLE GEORGE?

05:30.663 --> 05:32.066
YOU GONNA MISS HIM?

05:32.098 --> 05:34.735
YOU GUYS WERE
HANGING OUT A LOT.

05:34.768 --> 05:36.737
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
HE WAS YOUR...

05:36.769 --> 05:39.605
MY HUSBAND?!
STOP IT, BRENNA.

05:39.639 --> 05:41.475
I WAS GONNA SAY BROTHER.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.547
YEAH, I'M GONNA MISS HIM,
BUT IT'S FOR THE BEST.

05:46.579 --> 05:47.980
NEW BEGINNINGS
AND EVERYTHING.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.451
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S GET YOU SOME
NEW SHOES.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.052
THOSE ARE SERIOUSLY
FALLING APART.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.088
UM, THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT.

06:00.894 --> 06:02.062
April:
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE

06:02.096 --> 06:03.697
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
RIGHT AWAY.

06:03.730 --> 06:05.699
I HAVE TO HEAR IT
FROM NATALIE.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.000
DUDE, I WAS OBVIOUSLY
GONNA TELL YOU.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.836
I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW--

06:08.869 --> 06:10.704
I WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW BEST TO PHRASE IT.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.005
ESPECIALLY SINCE
IT'S NEVER HAPPENING AGAIN.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.541
I TOTALLY SHAMED
BOTH OF THEM.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.576
WE'LL SEE.

06:16.610 --> 06:17.778
YOU CAN NEVER TELL
WITH THOSE TWO.

06:17.810 --> 06:18.911
- THEY'RE BOTH SUCH...
- ( both sigh )

06:18.946 --> 06:21.081
SLUTS?

06:21.115 --> 06:22.682
- KINDA.
- ( both chuckle )

06:24.550 --> 06:25.786
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WITH NATALIE ANYWAY?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.053
I MEAN,
WE'RE ROOMMATES NOW.

06:27.086 --> 06:28.922
WE'RE GONNA END UP
IN THE SAME PLACES
SOMETIMES,

06:28.956 --> 06:31.824
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
WE'RE GONNA BE LIKE
FRIENDS

06:31.858 --> 06:33.860
OR, LIKE, HANG OUT
OR ANYTHING.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.697
WE'RE JUST--
GOD, WE'RE WAY
TOO DIFFERENT.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.598
YOU KNOW, I MEAN--
MM--

06:38.632 --> 06:39.932
LIKE, HAVE YOU SEEN
HER INSTAGRAM?

06:39.966 --> 06:41.869
- MM-MM.
- IT'S LIKE ALL SELFIES.

06:41.901 --> 06:45.404
I'VE DECIDED THAT
SHE LOOKS BEST IN
THE VALENCIA FILTER.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.441
( both laugh )

06:48.875 --> 06:50.677
I'M SORRY WE BAILED
ON THE CLUB TONIGHT.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.146
- OH.
- I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO GO DANCING, AND...

06:52.178 --> 06:53.781
OH, MY GOD.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.581
YOU'RE SICK--
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO WAIT IN LONG LINES

06:55.615 --> 06:57.617
IN THE FREEZING COLD
JUST TO GET INTO SOME CLUB,

06:57.651 --> 07:00.052
WHERE I'M SURE WE WOULD HAVE
CAUGHT WAY WORSE DISEASES.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.624
WHICH IS IRONIC,
BECAUSE THE CLUB
IS CALLED PURE.

07:03.656 --> 07:06.759
ALL RIGHT, WHO DO
WE THINK IS GETTING
ELIMINATED TONIGHT?

07:06.793 --> 07:09.629
CRYSTAL WITH A "Y"
OR CRISTAL WITH AN "I"?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.031
MY MONEY'S ON KANDY
WITH A "K."

07:11.064 --> 07:12.733
( laughs )

07:12.766 --> 07:14.701
- WHO'S THAT?
- ( both laughing )

07:14.735 --> 07:16.470
( pop music playing )

07:16.502 --> 07:17.771
( door opens )

07:17.805 --> 07:19.872
( door closes )

07:19.906 --> 07:21.507
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO PURE.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.843
OH, THE LINE WAS LONG
AND IT WAS COLD,

07:22.875 --> 07:24.711
SO WE JUST WENT BACK
TO APRIL'S AND WATCHED TV.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.045
ARE THOSE MY EARRINGS?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.747
QUITTERS.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.584
WELL, MY AND YOUR EARRINGS
ARE GOING THERE NOW.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.718
( knocks on door )

07:34.788 --> 07:35.689
( knocking continues )

07:35.721 --> 07:37.658
- ( sighs ) DOUG.
- WHO?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.459
( exhales )

07:41.595 --> 07:43.564
HI, DOUG.
WHAT IS IT THIS TIME?

07:43.596 --> 07:45.031
YES, UM, HI.

07:45.064 --> 07:49.202
SO, YOUR MUSIC IS
EXTREMELY LOUD.

07:49.235 --> 07:51.471
IT'S VERY HARD TO
WORK ON MY DISSERTATION.

07:51.504 --> 07:54.473
UM, BALZAC AND THE HUMS
OF JUSTIN BIEBER

07:54.507 --> 07:55.675
DON'T EXACTLY MIX.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.644
LIKE I'D EVER
LISTEN TO BIEBER!

07:57.677 --> 07:59.478
IS THIS DUDE
SERIOUS?

07:59.512 --> 08:00.848
OH, AND IF YOU DON'T MIND,

08:00.880 --> 08:04.151
COULD YOU TWO NOT WALK AROUND
IN YOUR HIGH HEELS?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.220
THE THUMPS SCARE MY CATS.

08:06.252 --> 08:08.120
- SURE, DOUG.
- COOL.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.956
- GOOD NIGHT.
- YEAH, GOOD NIGHT.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.625
- OKAY, BYE.
- OKAY, BYE.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.658
ALL RIGHT.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.196
HE'S A BALZAC.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.865
- YEAH.
- I'M GOING DANCING.
YOU WANNA COME?

08:18.899 --> 08:21.701
PRETTY SURE THESE
WILL GET US IN QUICKLY.

08:21.735 --> 08:23.670
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.771
OH, COME ON.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.139
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
THAT'S BETTER?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.507
SIT ON THE COUCH AND FALL
ASLEEP TO "HOUSE HUNTERS"?

08:28.542 --> 08:30.978
OKAY, I ONLY WATCH
"HOUSE HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL."

08:31.011 --> 08:32.511
ALL RIGHT?

08:32.546 --> 08:33.980
WHO CARES ABOUT
DOMESTIC REAL ESTATE?

08:34.014 --> 08:35.514
NO OFFENSE,
BUT I THINK

08:35.548 --> 08:37.985
MY 70-YEAR-OLD ABUELA
GOES OUT MORE THAN YOU.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.687
HEY, I USED TO GO OUT
CONSTANTLY.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.889
ALL RIGHT, YOU SHOULD
HAVE SEEN ME.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.857
I STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT,
I DANCED ON BARS,

08:44.892 --> 08:46.559
I WAS WILD, CRAZY.

08:46.592 --> 08:47.693
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

08:47.727 --> 08:49.162
( quietly sighs )

08:49.196 --> 08:51.230
MY BEST FRIEND
GOT CANCER.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.600
WELL...

08:53.634 --> 08:55.067
SHE'S NOT HERE
RIGHT NOW,

08:55.101 --> 08:57.236
SO...

08:57.270 --> 08:59.773
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR LIFE.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.140
BECAUSE, REALLY,
YOU DON'T HAVE

09:01.173 --> 09:02.308
MUCH MORE TIME
TO GO TO CLUBS
LIKE THIS

09:02.542 --> 09:03.644
BEFORE IT GETS SAD.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.111
AREN'T YOU
LIKE ALMOST 30?

09:05.144 --> 09:07.246
I'M 23.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.981
( exhales sharply )

09:09.015 --> 09:11.851
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
FINE, LET'S GO DANCING.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.854
YES!
( stomping feet )

09:13.886 --> 09:15.855
- ( banging )
- Doug: KEEP IT DOWN!

09:15.889 --> 09:16.889
( banging )

09:16.923 --> 09:18.725
( laughing )
NO, DON'T.

09:18.759 --> 09:19.759
( both laughing )

09:21.995 --> 09:23.196
( both laughing )

09:23.230 --> 09:25.298
I THINK GRANDMA'S DOING
A DUCK FACE IN THIS ONE.

09:25.331 --> 09:26.933
DID SHE LEARN THAT
FROM ME?

09:26.966 --> 09:28.936
( laughing )
THAT'S FUNNY.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.336
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
LOOKING AT?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.804
- GRANDMA AND HER FRIENDS...
- ( phone chimes )

09:31.837 --> 09:34.140
HAVE BEEN IN NEW YORK
FOR LIKE TWO HOURS,

09:34.173 --> 09:36.209
AND THEY'VE POSTED
30 PHOTOS.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.879
THEIR HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
HASN'T EVEN STARTED YET.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.648
OKAY, I'VE GOTTA
GET TO WORK.

09:41.682 --> 09:42.950
MOM, DON'T FORGET WE
HAVE LUNCH WITH LEO TODAY.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.150
- OOH.
- I JUST REALLY WANT

09:44.183 --> 09:45.786
YOU GUYS TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.053
NOT LIKE IT WAS
WITH DOMINIC.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.056
OKAY, NO HOSPITAL
RUN-INS WHEN YOU'RE ON

09:49.088 --> 09:50.890
THE VERGE OF
BREAKING UP, GOT IT.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.725
- ( chuckles )
- I CAN'T WAIT.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.061
HEY, GOOD LUCK TODAY.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.261
- THANKS. BYE.
- BYE.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.033
PFFT. SOMETIMES I THINK
GRANDMA'S COOLER THAN ME.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.701
SHE IS.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.274
OH, MY GOD.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.241
I HAVE BEEN MEMED.

10:09.275 --> 10:12.278
IT'S GOING AROUND
THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.880
April: MEMED?
THAT'S SO DUMB.

10:14.914 --> 10:17.783
WHATEVER, IT'S NOT LIKE
ANYTHING ONLINE MATTERS
ANYWAY.

10:20.921 --> 10:23.255
WAIT, BETH WENT OUT
WITH NATALIE?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.091
WHAT?

10:35.302 --> 10:37.169
SO HOW WAS THE REST
OF YOUR NIGHT?

10:37.203 --> 10:39.673
OH, IT WAS GOOD.
IT WAS GOOD.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.875
DID YOU DO ANYTHING
AFTER YOU LEFT MY PLACE?

10:41.908 --> 10:44.878
UH, JUST WENT OUT
FOR A DRINK.

10:44.911 --> 10:46.013
Yeah?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.681
YEAH, YEAH,
NOTHING TOO EXCITING.

10:51.018 --> 10:53.986
WELL, HOW ABOUT
WE DO HAPPY HOUR AT
THE CHARLES TOMORROW,

10:54.020 --> 10:56.056
TO MAKE UP FOR ME
BAILING LAST NIGHT?

10:56.088 --> 10:57.758
MM, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.793
PERFECT.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

10:59.826 --> 11:00.961
Okay, see ya.

11:03.029 --> 11:04.331
( Natalie and man laughing )

11:04.364 --> 11:05.698
Natalie:
MORNING.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.000
OH, HOW'S THE BRUISE?

11:07.033 --> 11:09.302
THAT FALL OFF THE BAR
LAST NIGHT WAS PRETTY EPIC.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.105
( both laughing )

11:12.139 --> 11:14.240
( bell ringing )

11:14.274 --> 11:17.210
Ford:
MANDATORY HEALTH CLASS
OUR JUNIOR YEAR?

11:17.244 --> 11:20.047
I CAN'T IMAGINE A GROUP
OF PEOPLE I'M LESS EXCITED
TO TALK ABOUT

11:20.080 --> 11:22.381
MY REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM WITH.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.183
( laughs )

11:27.287 --> 11:29.088
( laughs )

11:29.121 --> 11:31.091
YOU THINK YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.059
I AM SO FUNNY.

11:33.092 --> 11:33.927
WHY DID YOU DO IT?

11:33.960 --> 11:34.927
DO WHAT?

11:34.961 --> 11:37.697
START THAT STUPID MEME.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.131
REMINDER:

11:39.165 --> 11:41.735
YOU ALMOST GOT ME EXPELLED.
HAVEN'T YOU DONE ENOUGH?

11:41.768 --> 11:43.470
I ONLY WISH
I'D MADE THAT TUMBLR.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.304
BUT, LIKE, I HATE
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

11:45.337 --> 11:46.373
I ACTUALLY HAVE A LIFE

11:46.405 --> 11:47.474
AND, LIKE, WAY BETTER
THINGS TO DO

11:47.706 --> 11:49.475
THAN REGINA GEORGE YOU,
SO...

11:49.709 --> 11:50.476
GO POINT
YOUR FRIENDLESS FINGER

11:50.710 --> 11:51.711
AT SOMEONE ELSE.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.748
FORD,
SO SERIOUS QUESTION...

11:54.780 --> 11:56.283
DID YOU SPEND
YOUR SUMMER IN A COFFIN?

11:56.316 --> 11:59.019
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN THE SUN IN MONTHS.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.486
I DIDN'T SPEND MY SUMMER
GETTING DUMPED

12:00.720 --> 12:02.788
BY MY LACROSSE CAPTAIN
BOYFRIEND.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.957
YOUR BLACK HEART
MUST BE BROKEN.

12:04.990 --> 12:07.059
YOUR JUST JEALOUS
I HAD A BOYFRIEND.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.729
DOUBT ANYONE WOULD
TOUCH YOU IN YOUR
GHOST-LIKE STATE.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.864
BOO.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.231
Greer:
COME ON, SHELBY.

12:12.264 --> 12:14.734
AT LEAST WE ALL KNOW
HOW STALKER CARVER

12:14.768 --> 12:15.769
SPENT HER SUMMER.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.806
DID YOU DO THIS?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.508
BRENNA, I HAD NO IDEA.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.509
- I AM--
- Teacher: SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.313
SIT DOWN.
PLEASE.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.451
WELCOME, EVERYONE.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.485
THIS SEMESTER
WE WILL BE DISCUSSING

12:32.519 --> 12:35.254
EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR...

12:35.288 --> 12:37.790
BODIES--
HEALTH, NUTRITION,

12:37.823 --> 12:40.059
- SEX ED--
- ( hollering )

12:40.092 --> 12:41.260
CALM DOWN, PEOPLE.

12:41.293 --> 12:43.496
BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVE
NATURE OF THESE TOPICS,

12:43.529 --> 12:46.032
I WILL HAVE A QUESTION BOX
UP HERE.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.469
IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE
TO ASK ANYTHING, ANONYMOUSLY,

12:49.503 --> 12:51.071
JUST PUT IT IN MY BOX.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.038
CAN'T WAIT TO PUT
SOMETHING IN YOUR BOX,
MR. BALDWIN.

12:53.072 --> 12:55.075
( laughter, hollering )

13:05.851 --> 13:07.821
MOM. HEY.

13:07.854 --> 13:09.489
SORRY, LEO'S JUST
RUNNING A FEW MINUTES LATE.

13:09.523 --> 13:10.490
OKAY, NO PROBLEM.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.158
I HOPE YOU GUYS
LIKE THIS PLACE.

13:12.192 --> 13:13.994
LAST TIME I WAS HERE
I HAD THIS MOST AMAZING,

13:14.027 --> 13:16.495
WONDERFUL HUNGARIAN STEW.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.097
IT WAS CALLED A--
OH, WHAT WAS IT CALLED?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.865
GOULASH!
OH, GOULASH!

13:19.899 --> 13:21.201
IN FACT,
I HAVE THE MOST--

13:21.234 --> 13:23.570
MOM, SHH.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.572
I'M SORRY.
OKAY, YES.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.941
I'M FRAZZLED.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.943
I JUST SAW MY TWO MOST
DIFFICULT PATIENTS IN A ROW.

13:30.976 --> 13:33.113
NEITHER ONE OF THEM WAS
LISTENING TO ME AT ALL.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.548
OH, THAT'S ANNOYING.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.384
THIS-- I MEAN, IT HAS
TO HAPPEN ALL THE TIME,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.385
IT CAN'T BE THE FIRST TIME
PEOPLE HAVEN'T TAKEN
YOUR ADVICE.

13:39.418 --> 13:41.554
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S JUST-- I DON'T KNOW.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.523
I GUESS I'M JUST
FEELING A LITTLE MORE
SENSITIVE RIGHT NOW.

13:43.557 --> 13:44.524
WHY?

13:44.557 --> 13:46.826
IS IT BECAUSE GEORGE LEFT?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.462
UM, YEAH.
THAT, I GUESS.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.831
AND OTHER THINGS.
BRENNA'S STARTING SCHOOL

13:52.865 --> 13:54.868
AND ALL OF YOUR STUFF.
AND ENOUGH ABOUT ME.

13:54.900 --> 13:56.235
TELL ME ABOUT LEO.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.836
ANYTHING I SHOULD KNOW
BEFORE HE GETS HERE?

13:57.870 --> 14:00.072
WELL, HE'S REALLY,
REALLY GOOD WITH PARENTS.

14:00.105 --> 14:01.908
- ( nervous laughs )
- OH, UM...

14:01.942 --> 14:03.543
SO SORRY.
IT'S PLEASURE TO
FINALLY MEET YOU.

14:03.576 --> 14:04.543
LIKEWISE.

14:04.577 --> 14:07.147
- SHALL WE?
- YEAH.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.251
- HE'S CUTE.
- I KNOW.

14:12.284 --> 14:13.953
IT TOOK ME AWHILE
TO PERFECT,

14:13.986 --> 14:15.889
BUT EVENTUALLY
I GOT IT RIGHT.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.557
( clears throat )
LET'S SEE IF I CAN
DO IT HERE.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.426
( clears throat )

14:19.458 --> 14:20.894
( in French accent )
MACARON.

14:20.927 --> 14:22.895
OOH, C'EST BON.

14:22.928 --> 14:24.331
- C'EST BON.
- YOU KNOW,

14:24.364 --> 14:25.498
YOU GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO SAY IT RIGHT

14:25.532 --> 14:27.000
WHEN YOU WORK
AT A FRENCH BAKERY.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.534
LEO LIVED IN PARIS
FOR A YEAR.

14:28.567 --> 14:30.870
BUT THEN I HAD
TO MOVE BACK TO BOSTON

14:30.903 --> 14:32.504
WHEN I GOT SICK.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.640
WELL, IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU'VE RECOVERED.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.643
THAT MUST BE
AN AMAZING FEELING.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.644
WHAT HAVE
YOU BEEN UP TO?

14:37.876 --> 14:40.179
HONESTLY, NOT MUCH.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.414
( chuckles )
IT'S BEEN ALL ABOUT CANCER

14:42.448 --> 14:43.549
FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS.

14:43.582 --> 14:46.586
I DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH
TO SHOW FOR MYSELF.

14:46.620 --> 14:47.921
I MEAN, I KNOW
I SHOULD GET A JOB,

14:47.953 --> 14:50.490
BUT, I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU
PUT ON YOUR RESUME?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.225
"SPECIAL SKILLS:

14:52.259 --> 14:54.628
ABLE TO BE SUPER STILL
DURING M.R.I.s"

14:54.661 --> 14:57.096
OR "TAKING MORE MEDICATION

14:57.129 --> 14:59.633
THAN A 90-YEAR-OLD DIABETIC."
( scoffs )

14:59.665 --> 15:01.533
MUST HAVE BEEN HARD
BEING SICK

15:01.567 --> 15:03.636
DURING SUCH
FORMATIVE YEARS.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.339
OKAY, MOM, YOU'RE
OFF THE CLOCK.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.475
NO, I'M JUST
EMPATHIZING.

15:08.508 --> 15:11.378
LEO, YOU GOT SICK AT A TIME
WHEN MOST YOUNG PEOPLE

15:11.410 --> 15:13.647
ARE DECIDING
WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
WITH THEIR LIVES.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.250
WHILE OTHER PEOPLE HAD
NUMEROUS ROADS

15:17.283 --> 15:20.452
THEY COULD TRAVEL DOWN,
YOU ONLY HAD ONE OPEN TO YOU.

15:20.486 --> 15:25.258
BUT NOW ALL ROADS
ARE YOURS TO CHOOSE FROM.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.260
AND THAT'S SCARY

15:28.294 --> 15:31.096
BECAUSE YOU'VE NEVER
HAD TO WORRY ABOUT

15:31.130 --> 15:33.365
WHAT MIGHT BE WAITING
AT THE OTHER END OF THEM.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.269
NAH.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.538
I THINK I JUST GOT
A LOT OF TIME ON MY HANDS
RIGHT NOW.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.039
I'LL FIGURE IT ALL OUT SOON.

15:40.072 --> 15:43.176
YEAH, MOM,
HE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

15:43.209 --> 15:45.010
( silent )

15:47.379 --> 15:49.982
Leo:
ONE WRONG SNIP
IN THE SURGERY,

15:50.015 --> 15:51.951
I WOULD HAVE
BEEN PARALYZED.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.254
- SCARY, I KNOW.
- ( breathes deeply )

15:54.287 --> 15:57.624
NO WONDER
MY POOR LITTLE BRAIN
SWELLED MID-OPERATION--

15:57.657 --> 15:59.426
LANDED ME IN A COMA
FOR MONTHS.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.495
ANYWAY, CLEARLY I WOKE
TO TELL THE TALE.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.331
SO NOW I'M JUST

16:04.364 --> 16:07.500
CATCHING UP ON
EVERYTHING I MISSED.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.001
SO, PLEASE,

16:09.034 --> 16:11.403
NO "GAME OF THRONES" SPOILERS,
PEOPLE, I'M SERIOUS.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.706
( chuckling )

16:13.740 --> 16:16.009
HI, GUYS, UM,
MY NAME IS SOPHIE.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.644
IT'S MY FIRST TIME HERE.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.979
I JUST MOVED HERE
FROM CHICAGO

16:20.013 --> 16:22.248
AFTER GETTING SOME
GOOD NEWS, ACTUALLY.

16:22.282 --> 16:26.552
EIGHT YEARS OF TREATMENT
AND A DOUBLE MASTECTOMY LATER,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.654
I AM NOW CANCER FREE.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.123
- Woman: OH, GREAT.
- ( all clapping )

16:30.155 --> 16:32.192
- Woman: CONGRATS.
- ( Sophie sighs )

16:32.225 --> 16:33.592
YOU GUYS WOULDN'T
BE APPLAUDING

16:33.625 --> 16:35.061
IF YOU SAW ME
BEFORE THE SURGERY.

16:35.095 --> 16:36.528
I USED TO HAVE
THIS AMAZING RACK.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.331
- UGH!
- ( chuckling )

16:38.365 --> 16:39.365
( laughing inhale )

16:39.399 --> 16:42.568
ANYWAY, UM, I CAME HERE
FOR SUPPORT,

16:42.601 --> 16:45.404
BUT MOSTLY I CAME HERE
TO MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

16:45.437 --> 16:47.240
( sharp exhale )
OH MY GOD, WOW.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.075
I SOUND LIKE SUCH A LOSER.

16:49.109 --> 16:52.644
UM, I SWEAR,
I USED TO HAVE

16:52.678 --> 16:54.681
AMAZING FRIENDS.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.549
( voice quivers )
I'M SORRY.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.419
IT'S OKAY.
WE'VE ALL CRIED
IN HERE.

17:03.188 --> 17:07.093
I USED TO HAVE THESE
TWO BEST FRIENDS IN HIGH SCHOOL

17:07.126 --> 17:09.762
AND WE USED TO DO
EVERYTHING TOGETHER...

17:09.796 --> 17:13.500
( sighs )
BUT THEN I GOT DIAGNOSED.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.602
SO RIGHT WHEN THEY WERE

17:15.634 --> 17:18.505
HAVING THEIR FIRST BOYFRIENDS
AND GOING TO PROM,

17:18.538 --> 17:22.642
I WAS DEALING WITH CHEMO
AND LOSING MY HAIR.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.577
I MEAN, THEY WOULD
COME AND VISIT ME

17:25.612 --> 17:27.614
AND EVERYTHING, BUT...
( sharp inhale )

17:27.646 --> 17:29.648
I COULD TELL THAT
THEY FELT GUILTY

17:29.682 --> 17:33.051
THAT THEY WERE DOING
ALL THESE GREAT THINGS

17:33.086 --> 17:34.586
THAT I COULDN'T.

17:34.621 --> 17:38.525
AND SO THEY STARTED
KEEPING THINGS FROM ME.

17:38.557 --> 17:42.362
AND, EVENTUALLY,
WE JUST--

17:42.394 --> 17:44.163
WE JUST GREW APART.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.701
I MEAN, I-- YOU KNOW,
I COULD TOTALLY GET IT.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.436
YOU KNOW, THEY DON'T
WANT TO MAKE US FEEL BAD,

17:50.470 --> 17:53.173
BUT THEY WANT TO, LIKE,
GET ON WITH THEIR LIVES TOO,

17:53.205 --> 17:55.208
YOU KNOW?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.376
I JUST-- I THINK IT
WAS THE WHOLE

17:57.410 --> 17:59.679
TIMING OF WHEN I GOT SICK.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.347
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THIS

18:02.382 --> 18:03.715
SECTION OF MY LIFE

18:03.750 --> 18:06.519
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
SO EXCITING.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.321
I MEAN, I CAN--
I CAN NEVER GO BACK
TO HIGH SCHOOL.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.125
I CAN NEVER
GET THAT TIME BACK.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.501
( students chatter )

18:26.673 --> 18:27.874
Shelby:
HEY, BRENNA.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.642
( giggling )

18:29.675 --> 18:31.478
( laughter )

18:34.180 --> 18:36.449
I REALLY HAD NO IDEA
SHELBY WAS BEHIND IT.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.219
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I WOULD EXPECT YOU
TO STAND UP FOR ME

18:39.251 --> 18:41.386
WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN
STAND UP FOR YOURSELF.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.822
BRENNA, I'M SORRY.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.356
THING'S HAVE BEEN
REALLY HARD LATELY.

18:44.390 --> 18:45.391
WHATEVER.

18:45.424 --> 18:46.893
FORD WAS RIGHT.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.328
YOU'RE SHALLOW
AND YOU'RE SELFISH!

18:49.362 --> 18:52.131
AND I AM SO GLAD THAT
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.811
YOU KNOW,
FOR A CANCER SURVIVOR,

19:05.845 --> 19:07.212
SOPHIE WAS KIND OF
A BUMMER, HUH?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.214
ISN'T CANCER
IN GENERAL A BUMMER?

19:09.249 --> 19:10.282
YEAH.

19:10.316 --> 19:11.750
AND JUST LISTENING
TO HER TALK ABOUT

19:11.784 --> 19:14.921
HOW SHE MISSED OUT
ON SUCH A BIG PHASE
OF HER LIFE

19:15.153 --> 19:16.855
MADE ME WONDER IF
MAYBE I'M MISSING OUT

19:16.890 --> 19:18.458
ON MY TWENTIES RIGHT NOW.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.661
YEAH, I KNOW I DEFINITELY
MISSED OUT ON A LOT OF THINGS.

19:21.693 --> 19:23.695
BUT, LOOK, RIGHT NOW,

19:23.730 --> 19:24.931
YOU'RE ONLY HALFWAY
THROUGH YOUR TWENTIES

19:25.163 --> 19:26.432
AND YOU'RE IN REMISSION.

19:26.465 --> 19:27.834
- GET OUT THERE
AND LIVE IT UP.
- ( laughs )

19:27.866 --> 19:29.868
WELL, YOU'RE IN REMISSION.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

19:29.903 --> 19:32.337
AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO MOVE BACK TO PARIS.

19:32.372 --> 19:33.439
FUNNY YOU SHOULD
BRING THAT UP.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.874
I WAS JUST
THINKING A LOT ABOUT

19:34.907 --> 19:36.442
HOW MUCH I LIKED
WORKING AT THAT BAKERY.

19:36.476 --> 19:39.811
SO I GOT A JOB AT THAT CAFE
YOUR MOM TOOK US TO.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.748
SERIOUSLY?
THAT IS AWESOME.

19:41.780 --> 19:42.882
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT AWESOME,

19:42.915 --> 19:44.517
BUT IT GETS ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE

19:44.550 --> 19:45.585
AWAY FROM PETE.

19:45.617 --> 19:48.488
OH, NO,
IS THE HONEYMOON PHASE OVER?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.955
HE NEVER WANTS
TO CUDDLE ANYMORE.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.190
- ( chuckles )
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

19:51.223 --> 19:52.724
AND I ALWAYS HAVE
TO BE THE BIG SPOON.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.792
( laughs )

19:57.763 --> 19:58.897
Nurse:
TIME FOR YOUR MEDS.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.400
( hospital chatter )

20:00.432 --> 20:01.701
THANK YOU.
( clears throat )

20:01.733 --> 20:03.303
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.239
APRIL, DR. HAMBURG'S
READY TO TAKE YOUR BLOOD.

20:06.905 --> 20:07.874
OKAY.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.608
MEET BACK
AFTER MY M.R.I.?

20:09.642 --> 20:10.643
YEAH.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.288
- ( keys jingle )
- ( door opens )

20:26.692 --> 20:27.926
WHY AREN'T YOU AT SCHOOL?

20:27.961 --> 20:30.863
( voice quivers )
JUST LET ME EXPLAIN.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.999
YOU'RE NOT OFF
TO A GOOD START!
IT'S DAY TWO

20:33.231 --> 20:34.968
- AND YOU'RE ALREADY--
- I'M SORRY, I KNOW!

20:35.000 --> 20:36.301
I SHOULDN'T BE
DITCHING SCHOOL,

20:36.336 --> 20:37.836
BUT THE PEOPLE THERE
ARE HORRIBLE!

20:37.869 --> 20:40.873
THEY CREATED THIS
MEME ABOUT ME!

20:40.906 --> 20:42.709
WHAT IS THAT?!
I-- I DON'T KNOW WHAT--

20:42.741 --> 20:44.277
( sighs )
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

20:44.309 --> 20:45.310
IT DOESN'T MATTER!

20:45.345 --> 20:47.913
THE POINT IS,
EVERYONE HATES ME.

20:47.947 --> 20:50.383
- ( exhales )
- YOU CAN'T JUST
CUT SCHOOL

20:50.415 --> 20:52.884
WHENEVER YOU HAVE
A BAD DAY!

20:52.919 --> 20:54.988
MOM...

20:56.322 --> 20:58.958
I HAVE NO FRIENDS.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.027
- ( sighs )
- HOW AM I GONNA MAKE IT

21:01.259 --> 21:02.929
THROUGH THE NEXT
TWO YEARS

21:02.961 --> 21:04.896
AS A LOSER LONER?

21:04.931 --> 21:08.634
HOMESCHOOL ME, PLEASE.
( sharp exhale )

21:08.667 --> 21:11.837
I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO BE LONELY.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.673
IT'S A TERRIBLE FEELING.

21:16.342 --> 21:17.710
ONE OF MY LEAST FAVORITES.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.813
BUT YOU HAVE JUST GOT
TO POWER THROUGH IT.

21:20.846 --> 21:24.750
IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE
IT'S GONNA LAST FOREVER,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.786
BUT IT NEVER DOES.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.387
( sighs )

21:28.421 --> 21:31.057
I PROMISE YOU'RE
GONNA FIND NEW FRIENDS.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.063
I'LL LET YOU OFF
WITH A WARNING

21:37.296 --> 21:39.665
IF YOU'LL SHARE
THIS CAKE WITH ME.

21:39.699 --> 21:42.769
OH, MY GOSH,
WHAT DID YOU GET?

21:42.801 --> 21:43.903
CARROT.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.904
( chews )
OH, MY GOD!

21:45.938 --> 21:47.874
- ( people chatter )
- ( Beth laughs )

21:47.906 --> 21:50.009
( both laughing )

21:51.009 --> 21:52.478
( laughing )
I CAN'T.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.713
DO YOU WANT A SHOT?
LET'S GET SHOTS.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.982
SHOTS?
WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO YOU?

21:57.016 --> 21:59.585
OH, NOTHING, I'M JUST
TRYING TO HAVE FUN.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.453
IN FACT, I AM HAVING
SO MUCH FUN

22:01.487 --> 22:03.522
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO DO
HAPPY HOUR MORE OFTEN.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.090
OKAY, DEAL.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.459
( both laugh )

22:06.491 --> 22:07.993
HEY!

22:08.027 --> 22:10.430
THESE ARE ON THE HOUSE.

22:10.462 --> 22:12.932
IT'S GOOD TO
KNOW THE BARTENDER.

22:12.964 --> 22:14.567
I DIDN'T SEE YOU HERE.

22:14.599 --> 22:16.803
I WAS IN THE BREAK ROOM
GETTING MY STUFF TO LEAVE,

22:16.836 --> 22:19.771
WHICH MEANS I'M DONE
FOR THE NIGHT.

22:19.806 --> 22:21.907
I GOT YOU A VODKA CRAN,
BETH,

22:21.941 --> 22:23.608
TO MAKE UP FOR THE ONE

22:23.643 --> 22:25.577
THAT DOUCHEBAG KNOCKED OVER
THE OTHER NIGHT.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.079
OH, YOU GUYS
WENT OUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.048
YEAH.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.615
TO PURE.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.951
AND IT ENDED UP BEING

22:31.983 --> 22:33.086
ANYTHING BUT.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.922
NATALIE WANTED TO GO
SEE IF IT WAS COOL.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.522
YOU KNOW, I JUST DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING 'CAUSE IT
WASN'T A BIG DEAL.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.057
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.

22:39.092 --> 22:41.661
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
- SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
UP TO TONIGHT?

22:41.693 --> 22:45.530
THIS HOT D.J. IS SPINNING
AT A CLUB IN ALLSTON LATER.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.900
- THAT SOUNDS FUN.
- REALLY?

22:47.933 --> 22:49.067
REALLY, YOU'RE
NOT TOO TIRED?

22:49.102 --> 22:51.471
NO, I FEEL GREAT,
TOTALLY AWAKE.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.573
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE BEEN IN THE MOOD FOR
LATELY.

22:53.605 --> 22:54.973
A HOUSE PARTY.

22:55.007 --> 22:56.942
YOU USED TO THROW
THE BEST PARTIES.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.144
- BETH IS A GREAT HOSTESS.
- OOH.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.979
- I'D BE DOWN.
- ( squeaks )

23:00.011 --> 23:01.847
WHAT IF WE MAKE IT
A HOUSEWARMING?

23:01.881 --> 23:04.517
BEST IDEA EVER!

23:04.549 --> 23:06.152
OH MY GOSH,
WE SHOULD MAKE IT THEMED.

23:06.384 --> 23:07.854
OH, THEMED!
I'M LISTENING.

23:07.886 --> 23:13.058
UM, OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
AROUND-THE-WORLD POTLUCK?

23:13.092 --> 23:15.661
YEAH, LIKE EVERYBODY'S
ASSIGNED A COUNTRY

23:15.694 --> 23:18.564
AND THEN HAS TO BRING
A WINE AND A DISH FROM
THAT PLACE.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.900
Natalie: UM...

23:20.932 --> 23:23.035
ALL WINE TASTES
THE SAME TO ME.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.971
AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA
NEED SOMETHING STRONGER.

23:26.005 --> 23:27.740
WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS
MORE OF A RAGER?

23:27.773 --> 23:28.941
BEER PONG, FLIP CUP.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.609
- KARAOKE. YES!
- YES!

23:30.643 --> 23:32.044
OKAY, THIS IS
GONNA BE AMAZING.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.679
WE'LL PLAN IT ALL BEFORE
WE GO TO THE CLUB TONIGHT.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.013
THE D.J. SET STARTS
AT 11:30.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.782
HE STARTS
AT 11:30?

23:36.816 --> 23:37.983
Natalie:
YEAH, IS THAT TOO LATE?

23:38.017 --> 23:39.951
LET'S DO IT.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.653
OKAY, WHOO!

23:41.686 --> 23:42.888
- OH.
- CHEERS.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.090
( laughs )
CHEERS.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.895
- ( phones ring )
- ( people chattering )

23:51.663 --> 23:52.798
MORNING.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.500
WHOA.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.801
SOMEONE TOOK
A ONE-WAY TRAIN

23:55.835 --> 23:56.935
TO DARK CIRCLES CITY!

23:56.969 --> 23:59.572
UH, THANKS, DANNY.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.040
IT'S ACTUALLY A SIDE-EFFECT
OF THE CANCER.

24:02.074 --> 24:04.943
OH, MY GOD,
I'M SO SORRY.

24:04.977 --> 24:05.944
I DIDN'T--

24:05.978 --> 24:07.480
NOT REALLY.

24:07.512 --> 24:09.615
I DIDN'T GO TO BED
TILL 2:00 A.M. LAST NIGHT.

24:09.648 --> 24:10.916
2:00 A.M.!

24:10.950 --> 24:12.919
LIKE INFOMERICALS
WERE ON TV,

24:12.951 --> 24:14.086
THAT'S HOW LATE
IT WAS.

24:14.119 --> 24:15.922
I GO TO BED AT 2:00 A.M.
EVERY NIGHT.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.623
WHEN ELSE AM I
GONNA WORK ON MY NOVEL?

24:17.656 --> 24:19.090
IT'S "HARRY POTTER"
MEETS "INFINITE JEST."

24:19.125 --> 24:20.692
- ( yawns )
- I'M ALMOST FINISHED
WITH MY FIRST DRAFT.

24:20.726 --> 24:21.894
I'LL LET YOU READ IT
WHEN IT'S DONE.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.930
GREAT.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.730
IF YOU GO TO BED
AT 2:00 A.M. EVERY NIGHT,

24:25.765 --> 24:27.032
HOW ARE YOU ALWAYS
TOTALLY ALERT AT WORK?

24:27.066 --> 24:28.867
THAT'S THE BEST PART
ABOUT BEING YOUNG.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.569
YOU'RE WAY RESILIENT.

24:30.603 --> 24:31.971
NOT ME.

24:32.003 --> 24:33.605
YOU BETTER GET IT TOGETHER
FOR TONIGHT.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.842
THANKS FOR INVITING ME
TO THE HOUSEWARMING PARTY,
BY THE WAY.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.009
THINKING THE GIRLS THERE WILL
DEFINITELY BE MY TYPE.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.613
BREATHING? YEAH.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.882
OKAY.
( grunts )

24:42.914 --> 24:45.518
I'M GONNA RALLY
FOR TONIGHT BIG TIME...

24:45.550 --> 24:46.885
( sharp inhale )

24:46.919 --> 24:48.820
FOR ALL OF THE WORK
I HAVE TO DO.

24:48.855 --> 24:49.922
SO MUCH WORK.

24:49.955 --> 24:51.857
OH, THIS MEANS
YOU'RE GONNA BE TOO BUSY

24:51.891 --> 24:53.625
TO MAKE BETH
AND NATALIE'S PARTY.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.661
GRAHAM FORWARDED ME
THE INVITE.

24:55.694 --> 24:58.263
GUESS MINE GOT LOST
IN CYBERSPACE.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.932
( April laughs )
I'M SORRY.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.767
I JUST FIGURED YOU
WOULDN'T WANT TO COME.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.836
OH, YOU FIGURED WRONG.

25:03.869 --> 25:06.605
OKAY, WELL,
JUST TO LET YOU KNOW,

25:06.638 --> 25:07.973
LEO'S GONNA BE THERE, SO...

25:08.007 --> 25:09.275
THAT'S COOL WITH ME.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.876
OKAY, COOL.

25:10.910 --> 25:11.943
YEAH, COOL.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.113
COOL.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.682
ISN'T IT GREAT THAT
EVERYTHING'S SO COOL?

25:16.715 --> 25:18.750
I'M ABOUT TO GET A COLD.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.185
SEE YOU LATER.

25:21.787 --> 25:23.055

26:25.317 --> 26:26.786
YOU WERE SO TIRED

MAYBE IT'D BE BEST
IF YOU JUST--

26:28.220 --> 26:30.623
I AM SORRY, MOM,

A COMMON ENEMY

27:02.621 --> 27:04.856
SHELBY--
AND I'M THINKING

27:04.890 --> 27:06.659
THAT THE TWO OF US
SHOULD COMBINE OUR POWERS

27:06.692 --> 27:09.028
AND GIVE THAT HEINOUS WITCH
WHAT SHE DESERVES.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.997

AM I RIGHT, PEOPLE?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.192
( April laughs )

34:21.360 --> 34:22.360
- ( laughs )
- OH, OKAY.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.429
ALL RIGHT,
COME WITH ME.
COME ON.

34:26.063 --> 34:27.498
EXCUSE ME, THANKS.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.201
WHOO!

34:29.233 --> 34:31.637
APRIL, WHAT IS GOING
ON WITH YOU?

34:31.670 --> 34:33.204
- YOU'RE EMBARRASSING YOURSELF.
- ME?

34:33.237 --> 34:34.539
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE THE ONE

34:34.572 --> 34:36.608
DANCING AROUND LIKE SOME
TRASHY GIRL FROM FLORIDA.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.409
OKAY, WHAT IS YOUR
PROBLEM WITH NATALIE?

34:38.443 --> 34:39.811
HMM, LET'S SEE.
FOR STARTERS,

34:39.844 --> 34:43.514
- SHE KISSED MY EX-BOYFRIEND.
- YEAH, YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.

34:43.548 --> 34:45.583
AND IT WAS
AN HONEST MISTAKE,
BY THE WAY.

34:45.617 --> 34:47.385
WAS IT AN HONEST MISTAKE
WHEN YOU LIED TO ME

34:47.418 --> 34:48.719
ABOUT GOING CLUBBING
WITH HER THE OTHER NIGHT?

34:48.753 --> 34:50.655
AND THANKS FOR
THE INVITE, BY THE WAY.

34:50.688 --> 34:53.125
WAIT, WHY WOULD
I INVITE YOU?

34:53.157 --> 34:55.793
APRIL, WE WENT TO
THE SAME CLUB EARLIER
THAT NIGHT.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.161
AND YOU WANTED TO LEAVE.

34:57.195 --> 34:58.630
WELL, I'M SORRY, BETH.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.467
IS MY CANCER
INCONVENIENCING YOU?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.735
YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:03.768 --> 35:07.206
IT IS, ACTUALLY.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.407
WELL, I'LL JUST
GET OUT OF YOUR WAY

35:09.440 --> 35:11.275
SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR PARTY.

35:11.309 --> 35:12.344
REALLY, APRIL?!

35:12.376 --> 35:13.744
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE
ME FEEL GUILTY

35:13.778 --> 35:15.713
AFTER HOW MUCH I HAVE
BEEN THERE FOR YOU,

35:15.746 --> 35:17.382
TAKING YOU TO
DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS,

35:17.416 --> 35:20.117
STAYING IN WHENEVER YOU
DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING OUT,

35:20.152 --> 35:21.552
AND LITERALLY
DROPPING EVERYTHING

35:21.586 --> 35:23.422
- THE SECOND THAT YOU NEED ME?
- I GET IT.

35:23.454 --> 35:25.724
- I'M A HUGE BURDEN.
- OH, MY GOD!

35:25.757 --> 35:27.592
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT YOU RIGHT NOW.

35:27.626 --> 35:28.760
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME!

35:28.793 --> 35:30.195
FOR ONCE!

35:30.228 --> 35:32.431
I NEED TIME FOR MYSELF TOO.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.833
THEN IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU FOUND YOUR SOUL MATE
IN NATALIE.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.704
HAVE FUN TAKING
DUMB SELFIES TOGETHER.

35:46.277 --> 35:47.378
( students chatter )

35:47.411 --> 35:49.347
EVERYONE, GRAB A SEAT.

35:49.380 --> 35:51.817
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.253
GOOD MORNING.

35:56.454 --> 35:59.690
IT SEEMS WE HAVE
OUR FIRST ANONYMOUS...

35:59.724 --> 36:00.858
QUESTION.

36:00.893 --> 36:03.628
( paper crinkles )

36:03.661 --> 36:04.762
"THIS IS A CRY FOR HELP..."

36:04.795 --> 36:06.864
- ( mouths )
- "I AM A BULLY.

36:06.898 --> 36:10.568
WHETHER IT BE NAME-CALLING
OR MAKING UP WEBSITES,

36:10.601 --> 36:13.204
I'M CONSTANTLY HARASSING
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

36:13.237 --> 36:16.474
BEHIND THE LONG BLACK HAIR,
DESIGNER CLOTHES,

36:16.507 --> 36:17.809
- AND NAIL ART..."
- ( students mutter )

36:17.842 --> 36:20.679
"I SUFFER FROM
EXTREMELY LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

36:20.711 --> 36:24.215
I JUST CAN'T STOP
TEARING PEOPLE DOWN.

36:24.248 --> 36:25.817
I THINK IT'S THE REASON
MY BOYFRIEND,

36:25.851 --> 36:27.219
THE CAPTAIN OF
THE LACROSSE TEAM,

36:27.251 --> 36:29.186
- BROKE UP WITH ME..."
- IT IS.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.655
- ( laughter )
- SHUT UP!

36:30.688 --> 36:33.559
Brenna:
WE GET IT, SHELBY.
YOUR LOW SELF-ESTEEM

36:33.592 --> 36:35.760
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU
NEED TO DEMEAN PEOPLE

36:35.793 --> 36:37.496
IN ORDER TO LIFT
YOURSELF UP.

36:37.528 --> 36:40.666
BUT THE FIRST STEP
IS ADMITTING THAT
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.601
GOOD FOR YOU.

36:45.369 --> 36:47.806
( students mutter )

36:49.407 --> 36:51.543
( laughs )

36:51.577 --> 36:55.213
I GOT YOU A COFFEE AND...

36:55.246 --> 36:56.748
- A BREAKFAST BURRITO!
- SHH.

36:56.782 --> 36:58.750
FOR MY FAVORITE LUSH.

36:58.784 --> 37:00.552
THANK YOU.

37:00.585 --> 37:03.554
WAIT,
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST NIGHT?

37:03.588 --> 37:05.690
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I WAS AT THE PARTY.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.226
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.795
JUST KIDDING.

37:09.827 --> 37:10.795
I'M SORRY.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.664
NO, NO, WORK GOT...

37:12.697 --> 37:14.699
( mutters )
BUSY, YOU KNOW.

37:14.733 --> 37:15.967
AND I WAS TIRED.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.536
BUT I KNEW YOU GOT WASTED

37:17.568 --> 37:19.737
FROM ALL THE SPELLING MISTAKES
IN YOUR TEXTS.

37:19.771 --> 37:21.806
YOU ALWAYS USE SPELL CHECK.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.710
WELL, YOU MISSED
QUITE A SHOW.

37:24.742 --> 37:27.579
- HMM.
- I GOT SO DRUNK.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.815
I DON'T THINK I'VE
HAD THAT MUCH TO DRINK

37:29.847 --> 37:30.882
SINCE EVER.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.650
OH, AND BETH AND I,

37:32.684 --> 37:34.619
OH, WE HAD THE WORST FIGHT.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.623
I MEAN, WE DON'T
FIGHT LIKE THAT.

37:37.655 --> 37:39.291
HAVE YOU TALKED TODAY?

37:39.324 --> 37:42.661
I TEXTED HER THAT
I WAS GONNA TAKE A WALK

37:42.693 --> 37:44.730
BY THE WHARF AROUND 4:00
IF SHE WANTED TO TALK.

37:44.762 --> 37:45.664
ALL SHE WROTE BACK
WAS "K."

37:45.697 --> 37:47.365
- HMM.
- THAT'S IT.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.367
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S,
"K, I'LL SEE YOU THERE"

37:49.400 --> 37:52.570
OR "K, HAVE FUN,
NICE KNOWING YOU."

37:52.603 --> 37:54.940
YOU KNOW, I GUESS
I'LL JUST SHOW UP

37:54.972 --> 37:57.708
AND HOPE THAT...

37:57.742 --> 37:59.411
( groans )

37:59.443 --> 38:01.545
( gulps )

38:01.579 --> 38:02.648
I'M GONNA BE SICK.

38:05.317 --> 38:07.818
UH, YOU KNOW, I THINK
SHE HAD FOOD POISONING.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.355
( laughs )
FOOD POISONING.

38:10.389 --> 38:12.289
THAT GIRL IS HUNG OVER.

38:12.324 --> 38:14.992
SHE MADE MAC' AND CHEESE
AT 1:30 IN THE MORNING,

38:15.027 --> 38:17.461
LOUDLY AND MESSILY.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.630
( chuckles )

38:18.664 --> 38:20.998
SO DID YOU HAVE FUN
AT THE PARTY?

38:21.032 --> 38:22.567
OH, I ENDED UP
NOT MAKING IT.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.735
MY FIRST DAY AT WORK
LAST NIGHT.

38:24.769 --> 38:26.938
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.407
NOT REALLY, ACTUALLY.

38:31.510 --> 38:33.545
I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID AT LUNCH
THE OTHER DAY.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.313
SORRY, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO PRY.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.380
- THAT WAS--
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.349
I THINK YOU WERE
ON TO SOMETHING.

38:41.085 --> 38:45.090
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT I HAD A TUMOR,

38:45.322 --> 38:47.391
IT WAS BASICALLY
A DEATH SENTENCE.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.764
SO I DIDN'T WORRY
ABOUT MY FUTURE.

38:53.864 --> 38:55.766
UM...

38:56.802 --> 38:58.536
I NEVER THOUGHT
ABOUT A CAREER,

38:58.570 --> 38:59.771
MADE NO PLANS.

39:01.672 --> 39:03.041
AND...

39:05.844 --> 39:07.045
WELL, NOW THAT I'M NOT DEAD,

39:07.079 --> 39:09.847
I-- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M GONNA DO

39:09.880 --> 39:11.382
WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE...

39:14.686 --> 39:16.487
LIKE AT ALL.

39:16.521 --> 39:19.757
IT'S OKAY
NOT TO KNOW
RIGHT NOW.

39:19.791 --> 39:20.958
YOU JUST GOT TO REMEMBER

39:20.992 --> 39:22.728
YOU'RE LUCKY.
YOU'RE ALIVE.

39:22.760 --> 39:25.664
YOU HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE
AHEAD OF YOU.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.699
AND TIME IS FINALLY
ON YOUR SIDE.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.768
IT'LL ALL COME TOGETHER.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.706
I HOPE SO

39:34.739 --> 39:37.708
BECAUSE
I COMPLETELY LOST IT

39:37.742 --> 39:39.878
AND BLEW UP
AT A CUSTOMER LAST NIGHT.

39:41.780 --> 39:45.117
IT SCARED ME, ACTUALLY.

39:45.150 --> 39:49.653
WELL, LET'S TALK
SOME MORE ABOUT THAT.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.057
( Ford laughs )

39:56.094 --> 39:57.461
UGH!

39:57.496 --> 39:59.731
I THOUGHT I SMELLED BLAH.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.398
I'LL MEET YOU AFTER SCHOOL.

40:01.432 --> 40:02.733
GIVE HER A BLACK EYE,

40:02.768 --> 40:04.168
AND I'LL BUY YOU
A MASSAGE CHAIR.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.737
( gags )

40:08.440 --> 40:10.407
I MADE SHELBY
TAKE DOWN THE SITE.

40:10.442 --> 40:13.110
SPEEDINESS IS NOT YOUR FORTE,

40:13.144 --> 40:15.146
BUT THANKS.

40:15.179 --> 40:17.882
I GUESS.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.117
- ( bell rings )
- ( sighs )

40:21.920 --> 40:23.155
DON'T YOU HAVE CLASS?

40:24.822 --> 40:26.023
I DON'T FEEL LIKE GOING.

40:26.056 --> 40:27.025
I THINK I'M GONNA
GO GET SOME FOOD.

40:27.057 --> 40:28.092
DO YOU WANT TO COME?

40:30.027 --> 40:31.996
I, UM, PROBABLY

40:32.030 --> 40:34.632
SHOULDN'T MISS
ANYMORE SCHOOL THESE DAYS.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.869
ALL RIGHT,
THEN I WILL SEE YOU LATER.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.748
( women chatter )

40:52.751 --> 40:54.985
OKAY, I WAS SO
DRUNK LAST NIGHT.

40:55.019 --> 40:57.088
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
HALF OF WHAT I SAID.

40:57.121 --> 40:58.623
I DO.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.525
I WAS CRAZY.
I ADMIT IT.

41:03.594 --> 41:05.797
YEAH, YOU WERE KIND OF CRAZY.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.898
I'M SORRY.

41:07.932 --> 41:11.570
I'VE JUST BEEN
FREAKING OUT LATELY.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.771
YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA MISS OUT

41:13.804 --> 41:15.873
ON MY TWENTIES BECAUSE
OF THIS CANCER THING.

41:15.907 --> 41:18.175
AND IT'S LIKE NOW'S
THE TIME IN OUR LIFE

41:18.210 --> 41:20.711
WHEN WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE GOING OUT

41:20.744 --> 41:23.215
AND GETTING CRAZY
AND I CAN'T.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.217
AND IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO WATCH YOU

41:26.251 --> 41:29.588
DO THINGS THAT
WE USED TO DO TOGETHER
WITH OTHER PEOPLE,

41:29.621 --> 41:31.121
LIKE NATALIE.

41:31.155 --> 41:33.858
I DON'T GET WHY
YOU COMPARE YOURSELF TO HER.

41:33.891 --> 41:36.561
I MEAN, YOU TWO
ARE SO DIFFERENT.

41:36.594 --> 41:38.563
I KNOW.

41:38.597 --> 41:41.166
BUT SHE'S KIND OF
LIVING THE LIFE

41:41.199 --> 41:43.934
THAT I WOULD BE LIVING
IF I DIDN'T GET SICK.

41:43.969 --> 41:47.572
YOU KNOW, SHE'S KISSING
THE GUY I USED TO KISS.

41:47.606 --> 41:50.574
SHE'S RUNNING ALL
OVER BOSTON HAVING
A GREAT TIME.

41:50.608 --> 41:52.878
AND SHE GETS
TO BE YOUR ROOMMATE.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.913
AND YOU GUYS
ARE GETTING CLOSER.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.047
AND, YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE...

41:57.081 --> 41:58.817
SHE'S AN ALTERNATE-UNIVERSE ME.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.652
APRIL, NO, SHE'S NOT.

42:00.684 --> 42:03.188
AND SHE'S NOT REPLACING YOU,
OKAY, AT ALL.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.789
I MEAN, YEAH,
I HAVE FUN WITH HER.

42:05.824 --> 42:09.226
BUT YOU AND I ARE LIKE
SO MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.596
EVEN IF I HAVE TO HAVE
A NIGHT OUT WITH SOMEONE ELSE

42:11.630 --> 42:13.130
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
NOT FEELING UP TO IT,

42:13.164 --> 42:14.900
THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

42:14.932 --> 42:17.135
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN YOU ARE UP TO IT,

42:17.168 --> 42:18.702
AND YOU WILL BE SOMEDAY,

42:18.737 --> 42:20.038
YOU'RE ALWAYS INVITED.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.706
SO JUST STOP STRESSING OUT.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.943
GOD, I LOVE YOU.

42:27.711 --> 42:28.847
K.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.315
( both chuckle )

42:31.548 --> 42:33.652
SEE, I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA CALL ME OUT ON THAT.

42:33.684 --> 42:34.818
WELL, YEAH.

42:34.853 --> 42:36.320
- ( laughs )
- WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN TEXT THAT?

42:36.554 --> 42:38.623
YOU KNOW I CAN'T STAND
ONE-LETTER RESPONSES.

42:38.657 --> 42:39.990
I KNOW, I KNOW...
