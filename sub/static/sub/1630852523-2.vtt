00:26.776 --> 00:29.195
You still have a crush on Vinnie.
Leo knows too.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.280
I just think like,

00:30.363 --> 00:32.991
-there's not much selection here, honest.

00:33.074 --> 00:36.327
So it's just, like, eeny, meeny, miney…

00:36.411 --> 00:38.288
-Vinnie.
-Oh, hi, bud!

00:38.371 --> 00:40.290
Oh my God, chips!

00:40.373 --> 00:42.417
-Hi, bud.
-Oh my God.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.002
How was Chase?

00:44.085 --> 00:46.504
I just get frustrated with him

00:46.588 --> 00:50.008
because he always
just wanted to be very involved

00:50.091 --> 00:51.801
until music.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.096
So I told him that it bothered me
that he hasn't been around.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.099
And I do everything,
and it's been like that forever.

00:58.683 --> 01:02.270
But I also said,
"I really need you to be involved

01:02.353 --> 01:04.731
if you want to be, like, partners."

01:04.814 --> 01:06.483
Yeah, but that's fair.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.109
I have a lot to say about this one.

01:08.193 --> 01:13.406
The way that Chase moved out
was disrespectful, rude as…

01:13.490 --> 01:15.742
I don't know how you could do that
to one of your friends.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.994
Chase handled this
absolutely horribly.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.789
A month ago he sat and said,
"I'm moving in with you guys 100%."

01:20.872 --> 01:23.124
And then secretly looked for houses
without telling anyone.

01:26.127 --> 01:30.840
Then he got it, and had his manager
call me and ask if I could pay for it.

01:30.924 --> 01:34.469
I texted Chase, I was frustrated with him,
and I was just like, "Dude, come on."

01:34.552 --> 01:38.973
"You need to be a man and talk to me.
We've been friends for so long."

01:39.057 --> 01:42.894
And I told him, "I'm only gonna cover
your rent if you post the bang videos."

01:42.977 --> 01:45.647
He said okay. Then what does he do?
He moves out, doesn't post any.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.400
It's either time for him to move on
and stop trying to get those benefits

01:49.484 --> 01:52.070
or accept them and help us.

01:52.654 --> 01:55.532
We just have
a lot of business to talk about.

01:55.615 --> 01:59.327
Like, real business to talk about.
Me, him, and Alex have to all talk.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.046
<i>Ready… fight!</i>

02:15.135 --> 02:17.387
Oh my God! What did you just do?

02:17.470 --> 02:18.596
I don't know.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.057
Why are you insane at this?

02:21.558 --> 02:25.228
Social media's brought me
a whole new way of life.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.400
But it's also a bad side.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.989
I've known Charli for a long time,
and we used to date.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.449
She was my first love, yeah.

02:40.076 --> 02:42.996
Today we're gonna be filling
Chase's room with pictures of Charli.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.914

Having a public relationship is hard.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.126
My relationship with Charli
was publicized everywhere.

02:48.209 --> 02:52.297
What really starts to take a toll on you
is just the way that you're judged.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.258
They've started posting on Snapchat
fake-ass stories about me.

02:55.341 --> 02:58.511
It's, like, hard to keep yourself together
all the time

02:58.595 --> 03:01.431
when people have, like,
a thought or a tweet.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.641
It constantly stressed us out.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.644
Chase needs
to get out of this depression.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.647
I just definitely got in my head
about what people said about us,

03:09.731 --> 03:12.650
and I'm very closed off now
because of it, so…

03:13.526 --> 03:14.819
thanks for that,

03:15.403 --> 03:17.739
Internet.

03:18.781 --> 03:21.826
Do you want to get back
to the way things were between you two?

03:22.869 --> 03:26.956
I mean… I don't know.
I don't know what the future looks like.

03:28.082 --> 03:30.418
-No! What?
-Did I just win?

03:30.501 --> 03:33.254
-You just killed me.
-I was just doing this.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.215
Maybe I'm not good at this game.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.763
Oh my God, you're alive!

03:47.810 --> 03:49.979


03:50.063 --> 03:54.567


04:22.804 --> 04:25.890


04:28.935 --> 04:32.230
Recently, in this last month or two,
my numbers have been going down.

04:32.313 --> 04:36.276
Not drastically, not to the point of,
"My career's over, I'm going irrelevant."

04:36.359 --> 04:38.820
But I've noticed a spike going down.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.281
-Wanna go in the front?
-No, I'm hanging on.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.908
-Okay.
-It's what astronauts do.

04:43.992 --> 04:48.121
Very, very literally,
social media is a numbers game.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.249
Your money depends on the numbers.
There is a lot of pressure.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.418
Paper's full-on ready to go to space.

04:53.501 --> 04:55.128
What the is that…

04:55.211 --> 04:59.090
If people stop watching
as much as what I'm putting out,

04:59.173 --> 05:00.425
I'm doing something wrong.

05:00.508 --> 05:04.095
So it's like, "What am I doing wrong
and how can I get those people back?"

05:05.888 --> 05:06.973
you, Alex.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.810
Is it bad that I ate before this?

05:12.854 --> 05:14.314
It might be.

05:16.357 --> 05:20.320
Stop! Can we stop it?
So, I won't fly out of it, right?

05:20.403 --> 05:23.531
Oh my God.
I already have anxiety. I don't like this.

05:23.614 --> 05:26.034
I'm going one spin and I want it to stop.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.953
Are you actually gonna try,
or are you just gonna be like…?

05:29.037 --> 05:29.912
Have fun with it.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.873
Dude, I hate spinning.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.208
If you genuinely don't like it,
we'll stop.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.629
Oh my God, I hate it.
Oh my God. I wanted this.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.840
-One more spin.
-you, Calvin.

05:40.923 --> 05:41.841
Oh my God.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.761
-Wait, get three people.
-Am I going fast?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.929
You gotta use your body weight.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.267
Okay, stop it.
I'm right now.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.810
Okay, wait, everyone try.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.520
Oh my God.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.939
Look at how red his face is.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.066
I think I'm done.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.070
-Can you get me two backups?
-Yeah.

06:02.153 --> 06:05.073
Or something cool
we can get today or tomorrow morning?

06:05.156 --> 06:06.532
I need something cray.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.285
That did not go
the way that I thought it would.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.455
At all. It was so stupid!

06:12.538 --> 06:16.334
That gyroscope was $700.
$700 for 30 minutes.

06:17.001 --> 06:20.254
And I thought it was gonna be so cool,
and it sucked.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.297
Anybody else?

06:21.881 --> 06:23.508
I think that's it, actually.

06:24.342 --> 06:26.094
I have high expectations.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.805
My whole thing
is literally go big or go home.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.683
I always focus on trying to make something
trending or make something viral.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.644
I kinda constantly think I can do better,

06:34.727 --> 06:37.814
and I don't see myself
giving myself a break anytime soon.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.650
Do we have any ideas?

06:41.234 --> 06:43.820
We could to a Batmobile
or a monster truck or something like that.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.030
Something. I need something crazy

06:46.114 --> 06:49.283
because that was the most
underwhelming I've ever done.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.077
For $700 too.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.120
Yeah.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.747
What is wrong with me this week?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.546


07:04.090 --> 07:06.884
We're having ourselves
quite the dinner. Quite a feast.

07:06.968 --> 07:11.389


07:11.472 --> 07:12.306
That's wild.

07:12.390 --> 07:15.351
The one thing I was scared of doing
was getting my own place

07:15.435 --> 07:17.854
and not being able
to see my friends as much.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.693
When I lived with Hype House,
I was never alone.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.779
Especially when you live
with as many people as we do.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.699
Oh my gosh.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.035
Being alone is probably
one of my biggest fears.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.537
Hello!

07:34.620 --> 07:36.539
Oh!

07:37.331 --> 07:38.416
Do you wanna try?

07:38.499 --> 07:40.668
I don't know how to play games,
I'm super gay.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.795
-Oh, this is so loud.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.298
Chase's house is super, like, his vibe.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.301
It fits him so well. Like Dracula.

07:48.384 --> 07:51.012
But I'm just so mad.
His interior designer sucks.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.680
Whoever decorated the house is awful.

07:52.763 --> 07:57.518
Look at this. Get like me, bitch.
Look at this elegance. Y'all see this?

07:57.602 --> 07:59.437
I got succulents, bitch.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.813
Look at him.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.065
This is for the LGBT.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.071


08:20.583 --> 08:21.959
Hello.

08:23.377 --> 08:25.046
How did we get so lucky, man?

08:27.757 --> 08:29.008
-Hi!
-Hey, Charli.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.551
-What's up, Charli?
-Hi.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.886
Oh, look who showed up.

08:31.969 --> 08:33.804
-Hi.
-Hi. Good to see you.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.806
-Good to see you too.
-Thank you for coming.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.683
Of course. Thank you for having me.

08:38.684 --> 08:42.313
Me and Charli have always been there
for each other even before what we had.

08:42.396 --> 08:46.234
We just kind of always
remained friends for each other

08:46.317 --> 08:48.569
'cause we, like, believe in each other.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.365
-You look like a hooker.
-Do I look like a hooker?

08:52.448 --> 08:54.033
-An expensive one.
-Very expensive?

08:54.116 --> 08:56.118
-Are you Marilyn Monroe?
-Marilyn Mon-hoe.

08:57.328 --> 08:58.663
Is everyone here, by the way?

08:59.914 --> 09:03.167
Oh… Look who it is.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.002
Did you finish your homework?

09:05.795 --> 09:06.796
No?

09:06.879 --> 09:09.882
Chef, no dessert for Charli.
She did not finish her homework.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.884
Did you post three TikToks today?

09:12.385 --> 09:15.054
-How many did you post?
-She can't eat. She didn't post today.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.807
-Damn, who keeps calling me?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.476
Oh, no, I shouldn't have said that.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.061
Hey, Thomas.

09:22.562 --> 09:26.065
<i>Do you have a picture</i>
<i>of the programming code for Patty's door?</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:27.024
Yeah.

09:27.608 --> 09:30.945
I feel like it was kind of weird
that Chase didn't invite Thomas.

09:31.028 --> 09:36.826
There's so much going on with them
that it's really hard to take a side

09:36.909 --> 09:38.703
'cause both those guys are my friends.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.079
I'll send it in a sec.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.998
-<i>All right. Thank you.</i>
-Yep. Bye.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.374
Y'all wanna play a game?

09:43.457 --> 09:44.959
-Yeah.
-I'm down.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.586
-Y'all know Jenga, right?
-Yeah.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.506
Okay, so we're playing Jenga
but with a twist.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.301
So, you get two bricks,

09:53.384 --> 09:57.513
and then with a Sharpie
you can write a dare or a question

09:57.597 --> 10:00.016
and then whenever they pull it out,
they have to do it.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.934
It's like Truth or Dare with Jenga.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.436
Okay.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.897
-Bang!

10:06.981 --> 10:09.358
Post a thirst trap
on your Instagram story.

10:10.359 --> 10:11.277
Yes!

10:11.360 --> 10:12.778
Grab your crotch.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.448
Three, two, one, go.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.991
Oh…

10:23.205 --> 10:25.249
-There you go.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.752
FaceTime the most famous person
in your phone.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.425
Tweet "I just my pants."

10:34.508 --> 10:36.719
I have like 12 followers on Twitter.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.013
"I just my pants."

10:39.096 --> 10:40.306
Got it. Retweeted.

10:40.806 --> 10:41.849
Retweeted it.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.934
"Like, there is actively
in my pants."

10:44.018 --> 10:46.937
-"LOL. XD."

10:47.021 --> 10:49.565
-Jesus.
-Oh, wait. Wait!

10:49.649 --> 10:53.527
-Charli!
-That just jumped up 7,000 views.

10:53.611 --> 10:57.948
Charli D'Amelio has, I'mma say,
billions of followers.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.283
I can't even put a number on it.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.244
I think with all that clout,
she can run an empire

11:02.328 --> 11:04.455
and take over.
World domination at this point.

11:04.538 --> 11:06.290
Posting with her
obviously would help a lot.

11:06.374 --> 11:10.961
Some people do take advantage of the fact
that she is a walking clout token.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.422
Someone literally said, "Proof."

11:14.590 --> 11:16.092
Thanks for the Twitter clout.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.094
-Of course.
-Who's next?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.358


11:32.441 --> 11:34.026


11:37.196 --> 11:39.865
My piano's gonna be all set up
in my room once the room's done.

11:40.366 --> 11:44.120
I don't like asking you this 'cause
it sounds like I'm being an asshole,

11:44.203 --> 11:46.205
but can you not take over the entire room?

11:46.288 --> 11:47.373
I'm not.

11:47.456 --> 11:50.668
Okay, but, like,
in every room that we've had

11:50.751 --> 11:55.589
you always had a big desk and a big space
and it just keeps getting bigger.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.383
The fact is, like, I have a job

11:57.466 --> 11:59.135
where I'm consistently filming
and editing.

11:59.218 --> 12:00.970
It made sense to have a desk in the room.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.848
You have the majority
of the space in the shower,

12:03.931 --> 12:07.226
you also have
a majority of the closet space itself.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.522
It is hard to separate
social media and a relationship

12:11.605 --> 12:13.941
when you're in a relationship online.

12:14.024 --> 12:17.361
I live in a content house
and I literally make content all day,

12:17.445 --> 12:20.448
and the fact that it's invading my bedroom
is just frustrating.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.743
I'm trying to tell you that I feel
like I've had no space for myself.

12:23.826 --> 12:26.162
I'm not trying to sound like an asshole.
Do you get me?

12:26.245 --> 12:29.165
No, I don't think you're an asshole,
I think you're delusional.

12:31.751 --> 12:35.129
I'm trying to express to you
something that I want to,

12:35.212 --> 12:38.466
then when you say I'm delusional
it genuinely makes me feel like…

12:38.549 --> 12:39.717
It doesn't make sense.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.260
I don't wanna argue with you!

12:41.343 --> 12:43.721
-I'm trying to tell you what's on my mind!
-I-- No.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.265
I'm trying to tell you
all that is mine in the bedroom.

12:50.227 --> 12:51.479


12:51.562 --> 12:53.397
Logic and emotion don't mix.

12:53.481 --> 12:56.358
Emotions are how you feel
and logic is what it is.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.195
And emotions all the time
aren't what it is.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.863
Alex has me.

13:00.946 --> 13:05.034
He's shoved logic up emotion's ass
and mixed them all together

13:05.117 --> 13:07.244
and then I get frustrated, and then I cry.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.747
I'm asking you
to think about how I feel.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.833
It's just hard for me to say how I feel.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.669
And I was making fun of that,
and that's not okay.

13:15.753 --> 13:18.506
That's how you are.
And I know it.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.299
I'm so stressed!

13:21.008 --> 13:25.805
It's really hard to seclude yourself
from real life and filming life.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.349
And sometimes
I'll be so stressed and fed up

13:28.432 --> 13:30.726
and I'll blow up on Kouvr
and say something I don't mean.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.188
My biggest weakness right now
is finding that perfect balance.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.532
There's snacks, chips,
and then, like, candy.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.826
Have you guys never tried these?
These are fire.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.203
Where's the blue one?
I wanted that one.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.498
They're just raiding my snacks.
It's fine, it's no big deal.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.460
Food's ready if you wanna sit down.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.420
I'm good. I'm so full.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.713
Let's eat, baby!

14:00.214 --> 14:02.132


14:03.092 --> 14:05.052
-That smell real nice.
-You sit down there.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.930
-I'll sit on the king's throne.
-These chairs are comfy.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.516
I thought you were
gonna bring some cute boys.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.811
Where the boys at? Is it BYOD?
Is it "bring your own dick," or…?

14:13.894 --> 14:15.229
No. I got, like, these homeys.

14:15.312 --> 14:17.314
Are you in a relationship?

14:17.398 --> 14:18.232
No.

14:18.315 --> 14:19.859
-Oh, you're not.
-Sorry.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.152
'Cause weren't--?

14:23.112 --> 14:24.446
-Weren't you guys…?
-Yeah.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.658
Well, why are you over here,
and she's over there?

14:27.741 --> 14:28.576
Um…

14:29.076 --> 14:30.160
I mean, I'm here.

14:30.911 --> 14:31.912
Oh…

14:32.955 --> 14:34.999

Aren't they supposed to be dating?

14:35.082 --> 14:38.586
I, for legal reasons,
cannot answer that question.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.630
Do I know
why they're not sitting together?

14:43.424 --> 14:44.300
Maybe.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.053
Chase and Charli are still friends
even after their breakup

14:48.137 --> 14:50.973
because that's normal. Um, couples can--

14:52.433 --> 14:55.269
Ex-couples can--
Oh, you got me up. Next question.

14:55.352 --> 14:58.564
Go ask Chase.
Why are you guys asking me? I don't know.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.693
Hmm, interesting.

15:02.776 --> 15:04.486
Very interesting.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.282
Why are you so quiet?
Oh, you strong-ass bitch.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.618
-Canceled!

15:11.118 --> 15:13.203
Who was the last person
to get canceled at the table?

15:13.287 --> 15:14.330
Probably you.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.333
No one was talking to you, Hortencia.
Calm down.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.251
I made a song called "Canceled."

15:19.335 --> 15:22.838
Way to feed into cancel culture,
that fuels our depression.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.548
You really did feed the beast, huh?

15:25.132 --> 15:28.052
The first time I ever, like,
made a TikTok with a boy,

15:28.135 --> 15:29.470
fans called me a whore.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.473
Remember, Chase? I was just crying.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.435
When it comes to cancel culture,

15:36.518 --> 15:41.440
you never know
what someone might deem offensive.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.942
If you get canceled,

15:43.025 --> 15:45.319
that's what you're known for
for the rest of your life.

15:45.402 --> 15:49.323
The entire world hates you,
and they tell you to go kill yourself.

15:49.406 --> 15:53.285
"You should just die."
And I'm like, "Who raised you?" Like…

15:54.161 --> 15:55.913
Cancel culture
is used as a weapon now,

15:55.996 --> 15:57.873
opposed to a means
of holding people accountable.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.084
They don't wait
to cancel someone with facts,

16:00.167 --> 16:02.002
they do it the minute they hear something.

16:02.086 --> 16:06.548
I've been through it, it's not fun.
It takes a toll on your mental health.

16:06.632 --> 16:10.427
I threw up every morning 'cause I had
such bad anxiety from the situation.

16:10.511 --> 16:14.390
You can't leave home if you're canceled
'cause you're subjecting yourself to harm.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.016
You do lose followers.

16:16.100 --> 16:20.104
You lose brand deals and means of income
because people want to break your pocket.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.273
It seems truly
like your whole life is over.

16:23.357 --> 16:25.234
When's the last time
you got canceled, Larray?

16:25.901 --> 16:26.777
Her birthday.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.407
I threw Larray his 21st birthday party

16:31.490 --> 16:35.160
and there were a bunch of people.
It definitely wasn't COVID-safe.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.914
It was so dumb on my part,
and, of course, I got so much backlash.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.541
I can't be friends with her.

16:42.751 --> 16:43.961
Y'all wanna go inside?

16:44.461 --> 16:45.546
-Yeah.
-I'm down.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.010
-This is my room.
-Is your PC behind your desk?

16:51.093 --> 16:54.638
Yeah, but it's easy.
There's, like, a little power button.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.141
-You need to come more.
-I know.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.518
Like, actually.
You all need to come to the house.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.812
-I haven't been there.
-You haven't been there.

17:01.895 --> 17:03.897
And we should
have people over here too.

17:03.981 --> 17:07.818
Like, you should invite Thomas.
Dude, 'cause they wanna see you, actually.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.696
Why did you not invite Thomas?

17:10.779 --> 17:11.780
Just…

17:13.115 --> 17:17.786
Oh, my God. It's, like, against the law
to not do everything with Thomas.

17:18.954 --> 17:24.752
Like, I don't know. Things are awkward
between me and Thomas right now.

17:28.756 --> 17:32.051
Dude, I could mention it to them too.
Like, you wouldn't have to say anything.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.844
Yeah, I don't know If I wanna, like--

17:33.927 --> 17:35.179
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.396
Oh my God.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.191


17:51.111 --> 17:54.990
Why are people not capable of cleaning up
after themselves? I'm super confused.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.951
All I ask,
put all your stuff in the dishwasher.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.830
People don't know
how to clean their plates.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.916
People don't know where the pantry is.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.543
I play video games all day.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.421
Mia yells at me like she's my mom.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.257
-If you cleaned up after yourself…

18:12.841 --> 18:14.468
Mia reminds me
of a mother figure.

18:14.551 --> 18:16.428
She'll, like, stand in the kitchen
and be, like,

18:16.512 --> 18:19.264
staring at you
if you don't put your plate away.

18:19.348 --> 18:22.059
And you'll just be
looking at her like, "Okay."

18:22.142 --> 18:24.770
And I don't blame her, because it's gross.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.522
Like, I'm glad she does it.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.483
'Cause the kitchen would look like a mess.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.486
We need
to have a house meeting today.

18:32.569 --> 18:34.696
I'm gonna
take a picture of the kitchen

18:34.780 --> 18:36.198
because I'm tired of cleaning it.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.659
It's also really embarrassing
when people come over.

18:38.742 --> 18:40.452
-And it's just disgusting.
-I know.

18:40.536 --> 18:42.496
It looks like
no one cares about this house.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.332
-It's a really nice house, and it's gross.
-So irritating.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.794
They all expect everything to be paid for,
but don't do the work to get it paid for,

18:48.877 --> 18:51.463
then don't wanna even clean up
where they live for free.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.092
We're behind on the brand deals,
on everything,

18:55.175 --> 18:58.762
but then they all come cry to me
when the business isn't doing well.

18:58.846 --> 19:02.015
It's like in a relationship when someone
says they're gonna change and never do.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.603
Making content for the house
is the only way we live here.

19:06.687 --> 19:10.065
Chase was the person
that helped make Hype House what it was.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.360
Because he's not here,
everything in this brand falls on me.

19:13.443 --> 19:14.444
No one's doing enough,

19:14.528 --> 19:17.531
and we need to add more people
and make it more exciting.

19:17.614 --> 19:19.950
We can't just have Vinnie and that's it.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.036
Alex is doing his part,
Kouvr needs to do her part.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.164
I think she forgets how popular she is.

19:25.247 --> 19:28.709
She's probably the most famous person
in this house besides Vinnie.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.836
She doesn't realize that sometimes.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.845
If you guys didn't know, I'm known for…

19:39.928 --> 19:42.389
If you guys didn't know, I'm--
Oh, me. 

19:42.973 --> 19:44.808
Kouvr is stubborn,
and I love her for that.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.769
I'm so stubborn,
but I did feel bad for arguing with her.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.856
I found out my neighbor has
a nonprofit sanctuary,

19:50.939 --> 19:53.775
so, today, for the vlog,
I'm surprising her with something crazy.

19:54.401 --> 19:58.113
I'm known for surprising my friends
with things they're not excited about.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.366
Kouvr is afraid of ducks.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.453
Today I've decided to surprise Kouvr
with a duck in our room.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.040
-Oh, no.
-Come on, it's just a duck.

20:08.123 --> 20:12.794
I was feeding the ducks bread at a lake
and I ran out and they got mad and bit me.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.089
He's like, "Yeah, that was me!"

20:17.507 --> 20:20.469
-Grab her and run from there.
-Should I put the beanie on her?

20:20.552 --> 20:21.929
-Yeah, put it on her.
-Okay.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.891
-Mia, is it scary?
-Terrifying.

20:25.974 --> 20:26.934
you.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.769
-Wanna grab her now?
-Sure.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.313
Kouvr, it's scary.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.398
Once it's in,
the door doesn't need to close.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.235
Once what is in here?
What are you doing to me?

20:37.361 --> 20:39.363
Why are you letting
Alex scare you like this?

20:39.446 --> 20:41.573
Don't think she'd do it
if she knew what was happening.

20:42.574 --> 20:43.659
Stop it.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.411
You need to be very quiet,

20:46.495 --> 20:48.747
because if you upset it,
I don't want you getting hurt.

20:48.830 --> 20:53.919
Honey, I want you to take off
the blindfold in three, two, one.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.463
Oh my God!

20:58.882 --> 21:00.050
It's a fennec fox.

21:00.133 --> 21:00.968
It's a fox?

21:01.051 --> 21:04.137
A fennec fox, yeah,
the world's smallest species of fox.

21:04.221 --> 21:06.431
From North Africa. Her name's Willow.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.100
Hi, Willow.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.518
Do they bite?

21:09.601 --> 21:12.688
-Are you still in harm's way?
-Everything with a mouth can bite.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.942
But I'll probably bite you
before she will.

21:17.025 --> 21:21.154
The fox is actually so cute.
I was not expecting it at all.

21:21.238 --> 21:25.075
I guess this was a really good,
like, apology from Alex.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.121
Little cutie.
Don't you have big ears?

21:29.204 --> 21:31.540
If he'd gotten me a duck,
he'd be on the couch.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.958
She seems comfy.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.459
-Yeah.
-Does she cuddle?

21:34.543 --> 21:35.627
-Does she cuddle?
-Yeah.

21:35.711 --> 21:36.878
She can, yeah.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.255
Yeah, that's cool.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.841
But this isn't an animal
I'd typically cuddle with.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.427
What animal
do you typically cuddle with?

21:44.177 --> 21:45.053
My wife.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.014
Yes!

21:47.097 --> 21:50.267
I knew you--
I was hoping you would say that.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.438
Alex tends to apologize, but still film.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.732
And it's like,
do you need to film everything?

21:58.692 --> 21:59.568
So great.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.029
With Kouvr,
he doesn't need to film all the time.

22:02.112 --> 22:04.656
She has to put those, like,
boundaries in place.

22:08.243 --> 22:10.412
She's just gonna scope everything out.

22:10.495 --> 22:14.374
How do you, like, call over a fox?
Like dogs? Do you…?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.960
Cats, you know… What's a fox call?

22:17.961 --> 22:18.879
I don't know.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.925
He's dope, dude.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.223
Dude!

22:37.689 --> 22:38.523
Hello.

22:38.607 --> 22:39.483
Hello.

22:39.983 --> 22:41.068
Real hug.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.908
Just the man
I was looking for, honestly.

22:47.991 --> 22:51.286
-Hi, Nikita.
-I still don't know where my room is.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.457
Which is fine, 'cause I can honestly just
sleep in anybody else's bed, you know?

22:55.540 --> 22:56.625
Anyone in particular?

22:58.627 --> 23:01.088
-You know what? It's slim pickings here.
-Yeah.

23:01.171 --> 23:04.299
-It's not that many.
-I might have to sleep in the dog bed.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.967
I could sleep on a couch.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.764
Oh my God.
Is this my audition for the Hype House?

23:10.847 --> 23:14.226
You're, like, in Hype House
while not being in Hype House.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.937
I mean, I might
actually join the boy house.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.648
-Oh, yeah, you were just at dinner there.
-Yeah.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.609
-How was that?
-You did not miss out on anything.

23:22.692 --> 23:24.986
I'm confused on, like,
why wasn't I invited.

23:25.946 --> 23:27.114
Yeah, that's a little weird.

23:27.197 --> 23:30.575
Like, why wasn't Alex invited?
Like, two years been such close friends.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.869
Where's the invite
for our house to anything?

23:32.953 --> 23:35.288
It's weird that after
everything I've done for Chase

23:35.372 --> 23:36.832
and everything I've helped with,

23:36.915 --> 23:41.211
that he wouldn't even invite me
to a dinner when it's his closest friends.

23:41.294 --> 23:44.381
If I threw a dinner here
and invited friends, I would invite him.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.884
It's just another example
of there's no reciprocation

23:47.968 --> 23:50.720
between the way I treat him
and the way he treats me.

23:51.221 --> 23:52.848
Am I hurt by it? Yeah, of course.

23:52.931 --> 23:57.060
I don't think Chase has
the capability of being himself publicly.

23:57.144 --> 24:00.272
-He can't speak his mind for some reason.
-Mm-hmm.

24:00.355 --> 24:03.775
Every time there's something bad
to tell me, his manager's done it.

24:03.859 --> 24:06.653
So when I try to have
these face-to-face conversations,

24:06.736 --> 24:10.365
they just don't lead to anything 'cause
he won't open up about how he feels.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.242
Maybe he doesn't wanna piss me off.

24:12.325 --> 24:15.745
-Yeah.
-All I want is respect and honesty.

24:15.829 --> 24:18.039
That's what I give everyone else, so you--

24:18.123 --> 24:19.499
Let me play devil's advocate.

24:19.583 --> 24:23.086
You know, you are a very large man
compared to some of these boys.

24:23.170 --> 24:27.048
I would be intimidated, Thomas.
But that's not your fault.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.842
I get that I'm "intimidating,"

24:28.925 --> 24:31.678
but they've known me long enough
to know that I only help people.

24:31.761 --> 24:32.596
Yeah.

24:33.096 --> 24:34.973
Chase is very scared of conflict

24:35.056 --> 24:38.727
and that's why Chase didn't invite me,
out of everyone in the house, to come over

24:38.810 --> 24:42.189
because he knows that we have
some unfinished business to talk about.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.191
This isn't an equal partnership thing.

24:44.274 --> 24:46.651
It's not fair to me,
and it's time it changes.

24:46.735 --> 24:47.944
We have a business to run.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.489
If you're not gonna help,
what are you doing here?

25:04.586 --> 25:05.420
Hi.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.755
-Hi.
-Oh, there you go.

25:06.838 --> 25:07.672
Thank you.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.716
-How you doing?
-Surviving.

25:09.799 --> 25:12.969
-Thriving. Can I go over a couple things?
-Yes.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.764
Okay, so I've secured Thursday
for YouTube.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.642
I also locked in
the size 12 stripper heels.

25:18.725 --> 25:21.394
-They're not for me.
-Okay.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.396
Okay, and then the other thing.

25:23.480 --> 25:26.149
So I have locked in the gym,
but they're asking questions.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.276
What are we using the gym for?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.612
I wanna do, like, a dodgeball thing.

25:30.695 --> 25:34.574
Thomas, the last time I talked to him,
there's just so much tension right now

25:34.658 --> 25:35.992
between the two houses.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.702
Chase is doing his own thing,

25:37.786 --> 25:40.747
and I just feel like
there's weird, guy animosity.

25:40.830 --> 25:46.294
So, in my mind, I'm like, okay, gym,
balls, throwing at each others' faces.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.462
Plus me.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.713
It's gonna be fun.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.508
-And what side are you gonna be on?
-That's a good question.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.386
But I have two hands,
so I could hold two balls.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.263
Okay, great.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.683
-Hello?
-<i>Hey, how's it going?</i>

25:59.766 --> 26:02.852
Hi, good. I'm with Adden
going over the YouTube schedule.

26:02.936 --> 26:04.020
-What's up?
-<i>Uh…</i>

26:04.104 --> 26:06.273
<i>Well, we have a little situation.</i>

26:06.356 --> 26:07.899
Am I canceled right now?

26:07.983 --> 26:10.277
<i>Not quite yet,</i>
<i>but we have a pretty big issue.</i>

26:10.360 --> 26:13.238
<i>So I heard you went to a party last night.</i>

26:14.155 --> 26:16.324
Yes, I did go to a party.

26:16.408 --> 26:20.745
<i>What I'm being told is apparently</i>
<i>you might have got too intoxicated</i>

26:20.829 --> 26:25.250
<i>and, like, somehow forced Larray to come</i>
<i>knowing he had COVID.</i>

26:25.333 --> 26:26.960
Wait, who is saying this?

26:27.043 --> 26:30.130
<i>This is from Larray's team,</i>
<i>his management team.</i>

26:30.213 --> 26:32.591
-His team's blaming me?
-<i>They're saying that--</i>

26:32.674 --> 26:34.301
<i>Ultimately, it sounds like, yeah.</i>

26:34.384 --> 26:38.054
<i>But did you know he was COVID-positive</i>
<i>and still ask him to come over?</i>

26:38.138 --> 26:42.058
<i>-I think that's where the concern is.</i>
Nope. When I was at the party,

26:42.142 --> 26:44.144
he was like, "Oh, I'm gonna come."

26:44.227 --> 26:47.188
And I was like, "You have COVID.
What the is going on?"

26:47.272 --> 26:51.568
He's like, "No, I actually tested again
and I ended up testing negative."

26:51.651 --> 26:53.486
So it was a false positive.

26:53.570 --> 26:55.614
But he came on his own free will,

26:55.697 --> 26:59.117
there was no call
or there was no text ever from me

26:59.200 --> 27:01.578
being like,
"Oh my God, come to this party."

27:01.661 --> 27:04.164
Wait a minute. How is it my problem now?

27:04.247 --> 27:06.374
How am I to blame for this
all of a sudden?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.752
I was protecting you, if anything.

27:08.835 --> 27:11.963
That's like my best friend.
You're not gonna me over.

27:12.047 --> 27:15.300
I don't understand why I get
the short end of the stick and get blamed.

27:15.383 --> 27:16.760
<i> No one wants to look bad</i>

27:16.843 --> 27:19.346
<i>so everyone's gonna do</i>
<i>what they can to save face.</i>

27:19.429 --> 27:22.057
<i>-You were just an easy scapegoat.</i>
-Okay.

27:22.140 --> 27:24.601
<i>The bigger issue</i>
<i>is figuring out everyone's business,</i>

27:24.684 --> 27:25.935
<i>'cause we gotta quarantine.</i>

27:26.019 --> 27:26.853
<i>-You know?</i>
-Okay.

27:26.936 --> 27:29.939
Don't with my money,
and don't with my career

27:30.023 --> 27:33.276
'cause I have come way too far,
from nothing,

27:33.360 --> 27:35.904
to be some else's scapegoat. For what?

27:35.987 --> 27:38.531
Like, for what?
'Cause you wanted to go to a party?

27:38.615 --> 27:40.909
No. No. No.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.287
<i>Well, you get back</i>
<i>to the YouTube stuff.</i>

27:44.371 --> 27:47.457
<i>-I'll keep this moving. We'll chat later.</i>
Okay. I'll see you later.

27:47.540 --> 27:48.625
<i>Bye.</i>

27:50.085 --> 27:52.087
-What an asshole.
-I mean, that's crazy.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.798
People literally
get canceled over this stuff.

27:54.881 --> 27:57.342
I don't even know
if he knows his team is saying that,

27:57.425 --> 28:00.428
but at the same time,
like, don't with my bag,

28:00.512 --> 28:02.013
don't with my money.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.809
I would never do this to anybody,
and that's supposed to be my best friend.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.521
I don't know what I'm gonna say to him.
