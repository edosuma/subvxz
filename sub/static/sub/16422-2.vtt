WEBVTT

00:02.957 --> 00:05.423
Is Georgie mine?

00:05.424 --> 00:08.156
Of course Georgie is yours!
He's our little boy!

00:08.157 --> 00:10.423
James isn't Georgie's father.

00:10.424 --> 00:12.623
- But you said...
- I didn't give birth to him.

00:12.624 --> 00:16.590
You be as cavalier as you
wish with your marriage,

00:16.591 --> 00:18.989
but not with Georgie.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.423
He is a Bligh.

00:20.424 --> 00:22.223
He will be raised by us.

00:22.224 --> 00:25.123
Bear all the shame and part with my son?

00:25.124 --> 00:28.323
That is truly a Bligh solution.

00:28.324 --> 00:29.391
So what now?

00:29.957 --> 00:31.690
The truth.

00:31.691 --> 00:35.089
There's just one little thing
I need you to do for me.

00:35.090 --> 00:36.356
Could you teach me Italian?

00:36.357 --> 00:37.956
I could pay you.

00:37.957 --> 00:39.989
He's taught me a few words already.

00:39.990 --> 00:42.556
You'll be quite the Italiana
before you're done.

00:42.557 --> 00:44.523
You're not interested
in what I've written.

00:44.524 --> 00:47.323
Your subject matter, no.

00:47.324 --> 00:49.490
Perhaps Sir Richard might
advise on the way forward.

00:49.491 --> 00:52.757
No. Anna would rather
succeed on her own merits.

00:52.758 --> 00:53.790
Give me a kiss.

00:53.791 --> 00:57.557
He forced himself on me.

00:58.090 --> 00:59.390
He won't get away with this.

00:59.391 --> 01:02.289
I think your mother was
wrong about Sir Richard.

01:02.290 --> 01:04.989
Will you fetch me my book?
It's in my top drawer there.

01:04.989 --> 01:07.956
Whatever was between us,
George, you're a married man.

01:07.957 --> 01:10.523
- Nothing else matters.
- I'm equally unavailable.

01:10.524 --> 01:12.289
We will be together, Sarah.

01:12.290 --> 01:13.989
For one so young
to take her life.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.956
And then to use...

01:14.957 --> 01:16.490
If it hadn't been your mixture,

01:16.491 --> 01:17.790
she would have used something else.

01:17.791 --> 01:19.591
If she killed herself.

01:20.524 --> 01:22.289
What if she didn't?

01:22.290 --> 01:24.156
Your husband shot George Bligh.

01:24.157 --> 01:26.223
- I don't see what that...
- It's all right, Jack.

01:26.224 --> 01:27.690
I hear you're a Communist, too.

01:27.691 --> 01:31.390
The new Mrs. Bligh and I have
formed a delightful intimacy.

01:31.391 --> 01:34.723
Imagine my thrill the other
day when she visited me

01:34.724 --> 01:37.391
and even stayed to help
me with my little tasks.

01:43.824 --> 01:46.390
To what do I owe this displeasure?

01:46.391 --> 01:49.156
How does it feel to be a murderer?

01:50.006 --> 01:53.904
- Sync and corrections by Mr.C -

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.957 --> 02:20.989
I had no idea the depth
of your heartbreak.

02:20.990 --> 02:23.289
These are the ravings
of someone unhinged.

02:23.290 --> 02:25.989
You visited Doris. You
poisoned the tonic.

02:25.990 --> 02:28.723
And somehow the bottles were mislabeled.

02:28.724 --> 02:31.523
You would say anything
to take George from me.

02:31.524 --> 02:34.123
How can you live with
killing an innocent woman?

02:34.124 --> 02:36.956
- It was suicide.
- But it wasn't.

02:36.957 --> 02:38.290
And they have proof.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.957
It's become a murder investigation.

02:44.791 --> 02:46.690
There it is.

02:46.691 --> 02:49.156
- Fear.
- I'm simply surprised.

02:49.157 --> 02:51.956
That's what I came for...
the flicker of truth.

02:51.957 --> 02:52.956
Where are you going?

02:52.957 --> 02:54.956
Now you've confirmed it, the police.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.824
Let me save you the bother.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.089
Yes. Mildred.

03:02.090 --> 03:05.391
Call Sergeant Taylor and tell
him he's required at Ash Park.

03:05.957 --> 03:07.989
Yes, urgently.

03:09.791 --> 03:15.290
He hates Communists, I hear,
even more than his predecessor.

03:16.791 --> 03:18.989
"The Reds are amongst us, Sergeant."

03:18.990 --> 03:20.524
The Petrovs prove it.

03:21.090 --> 03:24.356
She's out to destroy my
husband by accusing me.

03:24.357 --> 03:28.124
"She may well have killed Miss
Davis to that very end."

03:30.224 --> 03:32.190
Who will he believe?

03:34.224 --> 03:36.989
I'll make a most persuasive argument.

03:36.990 --> 03:41.023
Riddled with supposition
from a bitter ex-fiancée.

03:42.357 --> 03:47.022
You know, I unearthed more
in Europe than darling René.

03:47.023 --> 03:49.123
Quite the dossier.

03:49.124 --> 03:51.956
What you did to survive the camp,

03:51.957 --> 03:55.356
its liberation by the Russians a
perfect chance to recruit you,

03:55.357 --> 03:57.956
and then months in an asylum,

03:57.957 --> 04:03.023
all of which makes you
a mad Commie whore.

04:03.957 --> 04:07.324
Exactly how I'll characterize
you to the sergeant.

04:08.124 --> 04:09.956
And I'll tell him all I know.

04:09.957 --> 04:12.757
Of which you have no proof.

04:12.758 --> 04:15.724
None.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.591
Checkmate, I think.

04:24.791 --> 04:27.523
Milly Davis was a young woman

04:27.524 --> 04:28.956
with her entire life ahead of her...

04:28.957 --> 04:31.758
Oh, get out before you're thrown out!

04:32.324 --> 04:34.956
And if anyone hears your
theory, especially George,

04:34.957 --> 04:37.490
the world hears you survived the war

04:37.491 --> 04:39.390
by spreading your legs
for the Wehrmacht!

04:39.391 --> 04:42.089
You won't get away with this.

04:42.090 --> 04:44.691
Expect a visit from the sergeant.

04:52.691 --> 04:54.123
I've kept yours warm.

04:54.124 --> 04:55.989
It's on the stove right here.

04:55.990 --> 04:56.989
I'm not hungry.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.956
You can't waste good tucker,

04:58.957 --> 05:00.290
especially not in your condition.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.424
I'm sorry.

05:37.290 --> 05:38.823
I want this on record,

05:38.824 --> 05:42.556
simply to protect against
further attempts to malign me.

05:42.557 --> 05:43.956
You're sure you don't
want her charged...

05:43.957 --> 05:46.089
trespass, false accusation?

05:46.090 --> 05:48.189
She left of her own accord.

05:48.190 --> 05:50.824
Well, I'll see she gets a
good warning, at least.

05:51.357 --> 05:54.089
Her ravings are so bizarre.

05:54.090 --> 05:56.491
I really can't take her seriously.

06:02.990 --> 06:03.990
Thanks for this.

06:05.124 --> 06:06.556
It helps to know.

06:06.557 --> 06:08.691
Forewarned is forearmed.

06:09.557 --> 06:12.324
But please... just between us.

06:12.824 --> 06:15.524
It gives me leverage in silencing her.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.289
Whatever you say, ma'am.

06:20.290 --> 06:23.356
And naturally, as so much
is sensitive material,

06:23.357 --> 06:25.424
once read, I would like it returned.

06:26.791 --> 06:28.224
Thank you.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.690
I used to stand at the
front gates as a child

06:32.691 --> 06:35.022
and wonder what it was like in here.

06:35.023 --> 06:36.123
I was born here.

06:36.124 --> 06:37.423
In Inverness?

06:37.424 --> 06:39.189
Left when I was 12.

06:39.190 --> 06:41.591
So, is it as you imagined?

06:43.324 --> 06:44.956
Not as grand.

06:44.957 --> 06:46.490
A child's mind.

06:46.491 --> 06:48.289
Of course, it is
properties such as these

06:48.290 --> 06:51.156
that the Communists
have in their sights.

06:51.157 --> 06:52.523
What's one of their sayings?

06:52.524 --> 06:53.790
"The last capitalist we hang

06:53.791 --> 06:55.289
will be the one that sold us the rope."

06:55.290 --> 06:57.190
We think as one.

06:58.491 --> 07:00.956
Do you still have family in the area?

07:00.957 --> 07:02.590
No, ma'am.

07:02.591 --> 07:04.156
A wife?

07:04.157 --> 07:05.423
No.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.724
Got a kid. He's with her.

07:09.124 --> 07:12.324
Well, I'll sleep sounder knowing
you're back amongst us.

07:13.758 --> 07:15.224
I hope so, ma'am.

07:16.957 --> 07:18.723
You, a killer.

07:18.724 --> 07:21.591
As insane as the woman herself.

07:23.023 --> 07:24.023
Good night, ma'am.

07:56.190 --> 07:57.491
Come in.

07:58.791 --> 08:01.290
We have things to resolve.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.989
Oh.

08:03.990 --> 08:05.956
I did <i>not</i> expect to see you.

08:05.957 --> 08:08.223
I come with an olive branch.

08:08.224 --> 08:09.956
Please. Sit.

08:09.957 --> 08:12.490
I wanted to talk about <i>our</i> situation.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.156
Father has something germane to offer.

08:14.157 --> 08:16.224
And then you can discuss
your own issues.

08:16.791 --> 08:18.957
- Drink?
- Sherry.

08:19.491 --> 08:20.591
I'll see to it.

08:25.957 --> 08:28.623
The election is in four weeks.

08:28.624 --> 08:30.590
Father is concerned
about party confidence

08:30.591 --> 08:32.789
should his leadership sniff scandal.

08:32.791 --> 08:36.224
Sir Arthur Fadden is
staunchly conservative.

08:36.791 --> 08:38.956
What do you want?

08:38.957 --> 08:40.990
A delay in the inevitable.

08:41.758 --> 08:43.556
Your return to Ash Park.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.556
At least until
after the election.

08:45.557 --> 08:46.956
And if I'm successful,

08:46.957 --> 08:48.956
at least until I'm well
settled in office.

08:48.957 --> 08:50.224
Six months at most.

08:51.090 --> 08:56.189
You send Carolyn to threaten me
with the law, then ask this?

08:56.190 --> 08:58.523
I'm hoping you can see
your way past that.

09:01.957 --> 09:03.623
You're happy to embrace it?

09:03.624 --> 09:06.323
I think we could carry it off.

09:06.324 --> 09:07.823
For Father.

09:07.824 --> 09:10.390
And for yourselves.

09:10.391 --> 09:14.790
In this current atmosphere, my
opponents may seize on things.

09:14.791 --> 09:17.590
The gutter press would relish it.

09:17.591 --> 09:20.791
You and... this artist.

09:21.957 --> 09:24.957
James, open to speculation.

09:31.957 --> 09:33.557
I see.

09:34.557 --> 09:37.190
If we could discuss it alone.

09:37.758 --> 09:39.357
Of course.

09:48.190 --> 09:49.790
I do understand if it's no.

09:52.624 --> 09:57.758
I sincerely hope, once
I've said my piece.

10:01.524 --> 10:04.723
When you asked me at Ash Park,

10:04.724 --> 10:06.791
I hadn't the courage to admit the truth.

10:08.624 --> 10:10.391
Georgie is...

10:11.491 --> 10:13.824
He is our little boy.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.824
But, James...

10:20.491 --> 10:22.990
our own child died in the womb.

10:33.391 --> 10:34.390
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

10:34.391 --> 10:36.090
- Miss Bligh?
- Yes.

10:39.990 --> 10:40.956
Sir Richard.

10:40.957 --> 10:42.957
Oh. Thank you, Carl.

10:43.524 --> 10:46.323
Beauty runs in the Bligh
line, young Anna.

10:46.324 --> 10:48.956
Well, so do brains, Sir Richard.

10:48.957 --> 10:52.189
I see. One of these new women.

10:52.190 --> 10:53.556
"Like me for my mind."

10:53.557 --> 10:56.323
Well, I'm here to discuss publishing,

10:56.324 --> 10:58.289
so that would suggest so.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.956
But still you're tizzied
up and out to dazzle.

11:00.957 --> 11:02.356
Seems you want it both ways.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.957
Well, you're rather tizzied up yourself.

11:05.824 --> 11:07.423
Oh. Touché.

11:08.957 --> 11:14.022
So, Dymphna Cusack, Eleanor
Dark, Christina Stead,

11:14.023 --> 11:16.324
and now Anna Bligh.

11:17.023 --> 11:20.624
Let's see what we can
do to make it happen.

11:25.957 --> 11:27.424
James?

11:30.324 --> 11:32.957
I did do it for love.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.723
Please don't be angry.

11:38.724 --> 11:40.324
I'm not.

11:40.791 --> 11:41.956
You must be...

11:41.957 --> 11:45.090
I'm not... angry.

11:49.324 --> 11:51.156
After my deceit in marrying you,

11:51.157 --> 11:53.624
I have no right to take
the moral high ground.

11:56.491 --> 11:58.357
I'm...

11:59.023 --> 12:00.957
sad.

12:04.357 --> 12:06.224
It's just...

12:07.990 --> 12:09.957
It's just so sad.

12:15.324 --> 12:18.189
To move past all that pain

12:18.190 --> 12:21.124
and find enough love to
motivate your actions.

12:22.424 --> 12:24.957
It makes where we've ended
all the more tragic.

12:32.324 --> 12:36.224
Perhaps you should fully absorb it...

12:37.424 --> 12:39.724
before we discuss anything further.

12:44.324 --> 12:46.023
The family should know.

12:51.090 --> 12:52.157
Olivia.

12:54.424 --> 12:56.157
Could I see him?

12:56.758 --> 12:57.990
Georgie.

13:00.491 --> 13:02.723
<i>"Va fangool."</i>

13:02.724 --> 13:04.323
You're a... You're a spirited filly.

13:04.324 --> 13:05.623
You know what it means?

13:05.624 --> 13:07.523
Every good businessman
knows how to say it

13:07.524 --> 13:10.022
in as many languages as possible.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.790
- Young ladies, however...
- Oh, shouldn't say it at all?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.989
Only on very select occasions.

13:15.990 --> 13:19.189
Mind you, this, uh, Cowan
chap does have a point

13:19.190 --> 13:21.323
about the public not being
interested in mixed marriages.

13:21.324 --> 13:23.956
I disagree. I think that
the story of my husband...

13:23.957 --> 13:26.723
The dago... damn fine
fellow in question.

13:28.190 --> 13:29.089
Ah.

13:29.090 --> 13:33.190
The way I see it... you're
ahead of the times.

13:33.691 --> 13:38.089
Write something you want to
say that they'll want to buy.

13:38.090 --> 13:39.824
I'd rather challenge them.

13:42.190 --> 13:43.990
You challenge me.

13:47.357 --> 13:50.556
You're intelligent, talented,

13:50.557 --> 13:54.791
you crack blue jokes with
a wink, not a snigger.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.223
I hope your dago appreciates you.

13:58.224 --> 14:00.623
No. Just pulling your leg.

14:00.624 --> 14:04.224
Right. Sweets and then home.

14:46.957 --> 14:48.956
I'm s...

14:48.957 --> 14:50.524
I'm sorry.

14:57.190 --> 14:58.956
It's all right.

14:58.957 --> 15:01.357
It's all right. It's all right.

15:03.824 --> 15:06.424
I understand. I understand.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.791
I don't.

15:11.957 --> 15:14.956
I have a few of these.

15:16.591 --> 15:18.723
Well, thank you.

15:18.724 --> 15:20.156
I-I just...

15:20.157 --> 15:22.556
It meant the world to me
to be taken seriously

15:22.557 --> 15:23.691
by someone like you.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.990
To everyone their due.

15:32.324 --> 15:34.224
Gentleman's privilege.

15:35.357 --> 15:36.956
Tell me how the meetings go, huh?

15:36.957 --> 15:38.957
- Good night.
- Good night.

16:07.524 --> 16:09.157
Are you coming to bed?

16:10.023 --> 16:11.324
Soon.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.224
Nothing I did?

16:14.758 --> 16:15.791
No.

16:18.990 --> 16:20.758
They're all looking
forward to meeting you.

16:22.391 --> 16:23.491
Tomorrow.

16:23.990 --> 16:24.990
The beach.

16:26.424 --> 16:27.956
Oh. I...

16:27.957 --> 16:30.391
Don't even think about canceling.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.691
It'll distract you from this.

16:34.557 --> 16:36.190
Whatever this is.

16:55.491 --> 16:56.989
Oh, I'm late.

16:56.990 --> 16:58.823
Get back.

16:58.824 --> 17:01.224
Go on. Just this once.

17:03.758 --> 17:05.955
We can avoid the sniping in here.

17:05.957 --> 17:08.156
Regina. She up?

17:08.156 --> 17:09.957
I didn't see her.

17:11.223 --> 17:13.989
You could always stay with me.

17:13.990 --> 17:17.123
I wouldn't give her the satisfaction.

17:17.124 --> 17:19.723
She's out to isolate George to herself.

17:20.491 --> 17:21.758
Ta.

17:26.990 --> 17:29.591
I'm sorry about last night.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.957
I just needed comfort.

17:40.990 --> 17:45.590
If you want me to keep away
from the mongrel, fine.

17:45.591 --> 17:48.190
You can't ignore what
it's doing to us, though.

17:52.524 --> 17:57.624
I can block out what he did...
until we were intimate.

18:03.824 --> 18:04.956
I love you.

18:04.957 --> 18:07.424
I know.

18:10.157 --> 18:15.690
There have been a lot of men
in my life, by my choice.

18:15.691 --> 18:19.758
Now there is you... again.

18:21.957 --> 18:24.289
And I never want another man.

18:24.290 --> 18:29.490
But one forced himself on me

18:29.491 --> 18:33.491
using every man who came
before to justify it.

18:34.023 --> 18:38.089
And he's made me feel... cheap

18:38.090 --> 18:40.957
and disgusting and...

18:41.957 --> 18:42.956
unworthy.

18:42.957 --> 18:44.758
Hey. Of me?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.323
- I can't help it.
- No.

18:47.324 --> 18:49.956
- No. N-No. Hey. Shh.
- You deserve so much more, Jack.

18:49.957 --> 18:51.691
- You...
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

18:52.157 --> 18:54.057
I'm here.

18:54.124 --> 18:55.523
I'm here.

18:55.524 --> 18:57.290
Always.

19:17.090 --> 19:18.290
I wonder what he wants.

19:20.957 --> 19:23.591
Has he got anything to do
with you being out of sorts?

19:26.424 --> 19:28.157
I thought as much.

19:34.090 --> 19:37.223
You've seen Regina Bligh, I assume.

19:37.224 --> 19:39.491
Let's get one thing straight up.

19:40.224 --> 19:42.089
I don't buy your bullshit.

19:42.090 --> 19:45.390
Can we at least talk about
your preconceptions of me?

19:45.391 --> 19:46.189
No.

19:46.190 --> 19:48.723
So you're taking her word as gospel?

19:48.724 --> 19:50.624
I've no reason not to.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.089
Regina meant the poison for me.

19:54.090 --> 19:55.723
If not her, who did kill Milly?

19:55.724 --> 19:57.123
She went to Doris Collins',

19:57.124 --> 19:59.356
- she doctored the tonic...
- And then the labels got mixed.

19:59.357 --> 20:01.123
That's what she said you'd say.

20:01.124 --> 20:03.557
All right. If not that,
give me a theory.

20:05.624 --> 20:07.989
Well, here's what I know.

20:07.990 --> 20:10.190
You were the first one
to suggest murder.

20:10.957 --> 20:13.757
"Look! I found a letter."

20:13.758 --> 20:17.356
You were covering up for your mischief.

20:17.357 --> 20:20.123
So you would rather think that
I killed an innocent woman

20:20.124 --> 20:21.757
for some bizarre Communist plot

20:21.758 --> 20:24.156
than that Regina was out to harm me?

20:24.157 --> 20:25.323
Yeah.

20:25.324 --> 20:26.723
That's insane.

20:26.724 --> 20:28.090
Spot on.

20:28.791 --> 20:32.791
I've seen plenty of killers,
none like Mrs. Bligh.

20:34.391 --> 20:35.823
You think this is funny?

20:46.328 --> 20:47.994
Six months?

20:49.060 --> 20:50.994
They're asking a lot of you.

20:52.261 --> 20:53.727
At most.

20:53.728 --> 20:55.860
They may not want you now.

20:55.861 --> 20:57.661
I hope not.

20:59.461 --> 21:01.027
And if they do?

21:04.361 --> 21:05.460
They won't.

21:05.461 --> 21:08.361
But if they do?

21:11.661 --> 21:15.227
George does have a point about scandal.

21:16.994 --> 21:18.661
And baby Georgie?

21:20.761 --> 21:25.227
Scandal would blight all of our futures.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.795
And animosity.

21:31.194 --> 21:35.460
What's best for Georgie is what's right.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.795
Mm.

21:37.994 --> 21:39.828
We'll come through it.

21:42.828 --> 21:46.027
Nothing will come between us.

21:48.060 --> 21:49.994
That's all I needed to hear.

22:01.861 --> 22:03.394
Thank you.

22:04.361 --> 22:06.593
There's no need to rush.

22:06.594 --> 22:08.461
There's a whole life ahead of us.

22:16.861 --> 22:19.761
Promise you won't do anything foolish.

22:22.394 --> 22:24.795
Right place, right time, he'll pay.

22:41.227 --> 22:43.794
Your carnal romps need curbing.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.059
We have impressionable young staff.

22:46.060 --> 22:48.460
If they can survive you,
they can survive me.

22:48.461 --> 22:50.528
Tears this morning.

22:51.161 --> 22:53.993
Such turmoil everywhere.

22:53.994 --> 22:58.026
The police investigating
Frau Nordmann as a Communist

22:58.027 --> 23:00.728
and Gino having female company.

23:02.027 --> 23:03.993
Sarah's no Red.

23:03.994 --> 23:05.560
Gino's certainly no philanderer.

23:05.561 --> 23:07.994
You, however, are a bitch.

23:09.628 --> 23:12.428
And invaluable to my husband.

23:33.528 --> 23:36.059
Yes. Mildred. I need a Sydney number.

23:36.060 --> 23:37.860
Sir Richard Bennett.

23:46.561 --> 23:48.260
Can you see that duck?

23:48.261 --> 23:50.661
Can you see Mr. Ducky there?

24:14.161 --> 24:16.160
The doctor doesn't
want you getting upset.

24:16.161 --> 24:18.361
Oh, I'm glad you told me.

24:19.528 --> 24:21.261
It's unimaginable.

24:22.394 --> 24:26.326
I accept her intentions, however
misguided, were well meant.

24:27.994 --> 24:29.260
How are you feeling?

24:31.994 --> 24:33.528
Confused.

24:34.060 --> 24:35.261
And Georgie?

24:35.994 --> 24:36.994
He's my boy.

24:37.561 --> 24:39.194
But he's not blood, James.

24:39.761 --> 24:41.060
He's still my son.

24:42.194 --> 24:43.527
No one's to say otherwise.

24:43.528 --> 24:44.994
And your love for him?

24:45.828 --> 24:47.461
Unchanged.

24:48.761 --> 24:50.561
I want him and Olivia at Ash Park.

24:54.060 --> 24:56.161
It allows us time to decide what's best.

24:57.127 --> 24:59.727
Well, then I think the three of
you should return to Ash Park

24:59.728 --> 25:02.360
and... resolve your futures

25:02.361 --> 25:05.226
whilst ensuring your
father's political one.

25:05.227 --> 25:07.760
The issue of the inheritance
must be clarified.

25:07.761 --> 25:10.461
In due course, George.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.327
In the meantime, my
darling, you have a task.

26:03.127 --> 26:05.661
I appreciate you agreeing to this.

26:14.994 --> 26:17.361
Hello, little man.

26:19.728 --> 26:21.059
He's well?

26:21.060 --> 26:22.428
He is.

26:23.461 --> 26:25.361
He's the innocent in this.

26:27.761 --> 26:29.261
Perhaps the only one.

26:31.994 --> 26:34.160
I have to ask...

26:34.161 --> 26:36.327
Is there no hope for you and James?

26:37.194 --> 26:38.628
No.

26:39.561 --> 26:41.461
Then I accept...

26:42.795 --> 26:44.594
with regret.

26:47.828 --> 26:50.327
I expected more severity.

26:50.828 --> 26:53.161
We're trying our best to understand.

26:53.728 --> 26:55.993
You know what bloodline means to us.

26:55.994 --> 26:58.860
James had been through hell.

26:58.861 --> 27:00.760
Having committed to the
lie, what was I supposed...

27:00.761 --> 27:02.160
If your marriage had survived,

27:02.161 --> 27:03.801
would you have allowed
Georgie to inherit?

27:05.561 --> 27:06.393
Yes.

27:06.394 --> 27:07.795
I see.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.993
He would have been the
product of Bligh love

27:11.994 --> 27:13.560
and Bligh upbringing.

27:13.561 --> 27:16.428
That is more important than blood.

27:17.528 --> 27:21.059
I find your attitude antiquated.

27:21.060 --> 27:22.728
Perhaps.

27:24.661 --> 27:25.861
Perhaps.

27:30.027 --> 27:32.860
I've simply come here to ask you

27:32.861 --> 27:35.993
if you can accommodate my request.

27:35.994 --> 27:40.594
If not for me... think of yourselves.

27:42.628 --> 27:45.728
Would it be possible without rancor?

27:47.227 --> 27:49.661
With luck, it may bring healing.

27:52.060 --> 27:56.227
Give you a chance to...
plan Georgie's future.

28:00.394 --> 28:01.994
Yes.

28:05.861 --> 28:07.194
You'll come?

28:07.994 --> 28:11.428
For James, for Georgie.

28:12.194 --> 28:15.661
Not for the man who threatened
to drag me into court.

28:16.594 --> 28:17.727
I deserve that.

28:17.728 --> 28:19.594
You do.

28:21.628 --> 28:22.828
Thank you.

28:45.628 --> 28:47.794
Do you think you could pick
that rubbish up, please,

28:47.795 --> 28:49.327
pop it in the bin?

28:50.227 --> 28:51.561
Thank you.

28:58.661 --> 29:01.060
Excuse me, Miss. You're a Jew, right?

29:02.661 --> 29:05.327
Well, I converted to marry a Jewish man.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.126
What's that mean?

29:07.127 --> 29:08.993
I changed my religion.

29:08.994 --> 29:10.527
Really? You can do that?

29:10.528 --> 29:11.727
Yes, you can.

29:11.728 --> 29:13.860
Wouldn't that make God mad?

29:13.861 --> 29:15.460
I don't think so.

29:15.461 --> 29:18.227
But the Jews killed Jesus, right?

29:19.361 --> 29:20.727
The Romans did that.

29:20.728 --> 29:22.160
Not the Jews?

29:22.161 --> 29:24.126
No.

29:24.127 --> 29:25.226
Oh.

29:25.227 --> 29:27.561
Reverend Green sure got it wrong, then.

29:34.528 --> 29:36.393
Telephone for you.

29:36.394 --> 29:37.594
A trunk call.

29:40.261 --> 29:41.394
Hello?

29:41.994 --> 29:43.994
I was being discreet not giving my name.

29:44.461 --> 29:45.994
Of course.

29:47.461 --> 29:49.060
It's good to hear your voice.

29:50.194 --> 29:52.026
Is everything all right? You're well?

29:52.027 --> 29:54.527
Yes. Yes.

29:54.528 --> 29:58.027
Well, my... my time here has
not been without its problems.

29:59.361 --> 30:00.993
Mother appreciated your card.

30:00.994 --> 30:03.193
Well, I've been concerned. We all have.

30:03.194 --> 30:05.059
She wouldn't be with us if
she hadn't have managed

30:05.060 --> 30:06.428
to pull down the telephone.

30:09.628 --> 30:12.994
I regret my bombastic
approach at our last meeting.

30:14.594 --> 30:16.394
My timing was poor.

30:17.828 --> 30:19.994
It was, but I understand.

30:20.461 --> 30:22.993
I return next week. I have
an important engagement.

30:22.994 --> 30:27.993
But when I'm done... we'll speak?

30:30.528 --> 30:32.828
I would like that.

30:36.594 --> 30:37.628
I hope you're well.

30:38.227 --> 30:40.326
Uh, yes.

30:40.327 --> 30:43.361
And our mutual friend is thriving.

30:43.994 --> 30:45.393
Best not on the line.

30:45.394 --> 30:47.161
Of course.

30:47.628 --> 30:48.795
Good.

30:50.027 --> 30:51.161
Everything else?

30:54.027 --> 30:57.794
I just put my foot in it with
one of the students here,

30:57.795 --> 30:59.627
but apart from that...

30:59.628 --> 31:01.594
Well, I won't keep you.

31:04.027 --> 31:05.461
I simply...

31:08.361 --> 31:09.628
I miss you.

31:11.394 --> 31:12.828
Rightly or wrongly, I...

31:13.394 --> 31:15.461
I have to say that.

31:17.461 --> 31:18.994
I'm glad you called.

31:19.528 --> 31:21.194
I feel better for it.

31:23.461 --> 31:24.594
Soon.

31:25.161 --> 31:26.428
When you can, George.

32:02.994 --> 32:05.194
Catch him!

32:15.261 --> 32:17.427
Hey, it's Henry and his new chap.

32:17.428 --> 32:18.860
James Bligh. Who'd have thought?

32:18.861 --> 32:20.393
He was two years above me at school.

32:20.394 --> 32:21.993
Many steamy nights in the dorm?

32:21.994 --> 32:23.160
Sadly, no.

32:23.161 --> 32:25.126
Henry!

32:25.127 --> 32:26.827
Christopher!

32:26.828 --> 32:28.127
Come on in!

32:29.127 --> 32:30.994
Oh!

32:31.795 --> 32:33.993
I shouldn't have come.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.593
Oh, you need distraction.

32:36.594 --> 32:38.628
I'm not sure I need <i>this.</i>

32:39.127 --> 32:41.193
They're my friends.

32:41.194 --> 32:43.727
And your friends, too,
if you'll let them.

32:55.994 --> 32:57.993
Coming in?

32:57.994 --> 32:59.794
Soon.

33:11.327 --> 33:13.860
I expect a full report upon my return.

33:13.861 --> 33:14.794
Yes, ma'am.

33:14.795 --> 33:16.527
And don't forgo our little project.

33:16.528 --> 33:17.994
I won't.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.994
I'm sure Gino appreciates your company.

33:23.461 --> 33:27.361
If Miss Carolyn asks, say
I'm off to be invaluable.

33:42.227 --> 33:44.059
Are you ready?

33:44.060 --> 33:45.528
Yes.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.794
This will sustain me in your absence.

33:52.628 --> 33:54.193
Do I really look like that?

33:54.194 --> 33:57.660
I told you... You are my new muse.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.627
Even when I'm abandoning you?

33:59.628 --> 34:02.127
Ah. Only for a time.

34:10.761 --> 34:12.527
I've had a thought.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.993
Rather than my mooching here,

34:14.994 --> 34:18.027
just waiting for the time to be
over, why don't I go on ahead?

34:19.261 --> 34:20.260
To England?

34:20.261 --> 34:23.326
I mean, you could arrange introductions,

34:23.327 --> 34:30.193
see I'm well part of society,
perhaps even with commissions.

34:30.194 --> 34:31.993
And by the time we face your family,

34:31.994 --> 34:35.795
I would be much more acceptable.

34:36.527 --> 34:39.427
Oh, it... it does make sense.

34:39.428 --> 34:42.193
Unless you'll need my support.

34:42.194 --> 34:43.561
No.

34:44.761 --> 34:48.260
No. It would stop me
worrying about you, in fact.

34:48.261 --> 34:49.059
Good.

34:49.060 --> 34:51.793
And it <i>is</i> a show of faith
in what's to come.

34:51.795 --> 34:52.993
Exactly.

34:52.994 --> 34:56.427
I will be the darling of the
Mayfair set in no time.

34:57.561 --> 34:58.627
I rather like that.

34:58.628 --> 35:00.460
All the bright young things.

35:00.461 --> 35:04.193
Yes. It'll be like living
a novel by Evelyn Waugh.

35:12.060 --> 35:15.027
I <i>am</i> rather funds-depleted, however.

35:15.994 --> 35:17.059
- I'm not.
- No. No, no, no.

35:17.060 --> 35:18.026
I couldn't possibly...

35:18.027 --> 35:19.993
Don't be silly.

35:19.994 --> 35:21.661
Of course I'll pay.

35:22.528 --> 35:25.193
The more I consider it,
the more it solves.

35:27.394 --> 35:28.728
Our future.

35:31.060 --> 35:32.994
Henry. Henry.

35:46.027 --> 35:47.326
I'm sorry.

35:47.327 --> 35:49.060
This makes you uncomfortable.

35:49.628 --> 35:51.795
I'm just not used to it.

35:53.528 --> 35:56.428
It's just playfulness.
It's not sexuality.

35:57.628 --> 36:00.627
Four nearly naked men falling
on top of each other.

36:00.628 --> 36:03.627
We <i>can</i> control ourselves.

36:03.628 --> 36:07.461
Honestly, the myth of the
salivating predator.

36:09.528 --> 36:12.027
I'm on my soapbox. I apologize.

36:12.528 --> 36:14.528
No. Please.

36:14.994 --> 36:17.993
It's just that, as with
any group of outsiders,

36:17.994 --> 36:19.994
we're defined by our worst.

36:20.761 --> 36:23.060
Even our own sometimes fear us.

36:24.828 --> 36:26.728
Here, we can just be ourselves.

36:28.994 --> 36:31.427
And if others stumble across you?

36:31.428 --> 36:34.661
Then it's two paces apart
and back into hiding.

36:41.261 --> 36:44.261
We come in all shapes and sizes, James.

36:52.394 --> 36:54.393
Better put you on the payroll.

36:54.394 --> 36:57.226
Doctor's aid and comfort.

36:57.227 --> 36:58.627
Too much?

36:58.628 --> 37:00.161
Never too much.

37:01.227 --> 37:03.461
I like watching you work.

37:08.361 --> 37:09.527
Doctor, if I may?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.160
Miss Carolyn!

37:11.161 --> 37:12.460
Uh, can it wait?

37:12.461 --> 37:14.394
Come in, Doris.

37:14.994 --> 37:17.226
I won't take a moment.

37:17.227 --> 37:20.460
I fear my reputation may be at risk.

37:20.461 --> 37:21.727
What are you on about?

37:21.728 --> 37:22.994
Mm.

37:24.795 --> 37:27.593
Ah. It's knocked the
election off the front page.

37:27.594 --> 37:28.727
That's for sure.

37:28.728 --> 37:30.460
Sergeant Taylor has asked

37:30.461 --> 37:32.460
if anyone may have
tampered with the tonic

37:32.461 --> 37:34.460
before it left my house.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.794
He's just doing his job.

37:35.795 --> 37:37.860
Well, I vehemently assured him not.

37:37.861 --> 37:38.993
There you are, then.

37:38.994 --> 37:41.860
But my young boarders, my
visitors, their good names.

37:41.861 --> 37:43.193
Even my own.

37:43.194 --> 37:45.993
There are tongues in Inverness
willing to wag at the worst...

37:45.994 --> 37:47.360
For God's sakes.

37:47.361 --> 37:50.026
They won't see you harboring
the local Lucrezia Borgia.

37:50.027 --> 37:51.326
The what?

37:51.327 --> 37:53.560
A famous poisoner of the Renaissance.

37:53.561 --> 37:56.126
Oh, yes. Leticia Borgia.
I know her well.

37:56.127 --> 38:00.761
As long as there are those
who will defend me and mine.

38:01.761 --> 38:03.361
Is that it, then?

38:04.261 --> 38:06.860
It is. And many thanks.

38:06.861 --> 38:10.226
I leave reassured.

38:10.227 --> 38:13.161
Apart from the fact that we
have a murderer in our midst.

38:21.127 --> 38:23.994
Whatever you're sulking about, stop.

38:27.461 --> 38:28.661
Come here.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.661
What is it?

38:36.728 --> 38:38.594
How many of them have you had?

38:40.861 --> 38:42.361
I beg your pardon.

38:42.994 --> 38:44.993
Have you had sex with them all?

38:47.161 --> 38:49.261
I left my wife for you.

38:51.594 --> 38:52.593
The truth?

38:52.594 --> 38:53.761
Yes.

38:59.194 --> 39:01.327
Christopher and I were lovers.

39:02.661 --> 39:04.194
Were.

39:04.761 --> 39:06.393
You were all over <i>him in the water.</i>

39:06.394 --> 39:10.126
And it would have been you
if you'd deigned to join us

39:10.127 --> 39:14.127
instead of sitting on your towel
like some judgmental prude.

39:15.828 --> 39:17.560
I don't want you seeing them again.

39:17.561 --> 39:19.461
You don't want...

39:21.194 --> 39:22.993
James, I'm not Olivia.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.461
And I'm not Christopher.

39:28.027 --> 39:29.561
It's been a long day.

39:31.227 --> 39:32.993
Maybe it was too much too soon.

39:32.994 --> 39:33.994
I mean it.

39:38.528 --> 39:41.327
I'm gonna put this down to
whatever's on your mind.

39:42.461 --> 39:43.761
Don't take that out on me.

40:10.528 --> 40:11.993
Music to my ears...

40:11.994 --> 40:13.760
"We're releasing you, Mrs. Bligh."

40:13.761 --> 40:16.226
As long as Anna is happy to stay on.

40:16.227 --> 40:17.728
She said as much.

40:18.227 --> 40:20.261
Surprise!

40:20.761 --> 40:23.460
Look who I stumbled over on my way in.

40:23.461 --> 40:26.360
Sir Richard. What a surprise.

40:26.361 --> 40:28.628
I've been so concerned.

40:35.761 --> 40:39.160
I've come here today with
thoughts for the campaign.

40:39.161 --> 40:41.827
It's so fortuitous to
have you with us, Dicky.

40:41.828 --> 40:43.593
George, I feel a sudden weariness.

40:43.594 --> 40:45.660
I'd like your opinion, too.

40:45.661 --> 40:48.360
Let's hear her out, and
then I'm gonna be off.

40:48.361 --> 40:49.827
I don't want to tire the patient.

40:50.828 --> 40:54.661
As I dined last night, I
had a startling idea.

40:55.261 --> 40:56.393
Yes?

40:56.394 --> 40:59.059
I took it upon myself to
call a contact in Canberra

40:59.060 --> 41:01.460
and check the prime minister's schedule.

41:01.461 --> 41:05.627
Mr. Menzies and Dame Pattie
are in Sydney next week...

41:05.628 --> 41:07.460
with time to spare.

41:07.461 --> 41:09.393
This close to the election, I doubt it.

41:09.394 --> 41:11.794
An event was canceled.

41:11.795 --> 41:13.860
Let's invite them down for dinner.

41:13.861 --> 41:16.126
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

41:16.127 --> 41:18.226
The protocol. The distance.

41:18.227 --> 41:21.360
Well, if it's inconvenient,
they'll simply decline.

41:21.361 --> 41:23.993
Nothing ventured, nothing win, I say.

41:23.994 --> 41:26.026
She's a bloody marvel, your wife.

41:26.027 --> 41:29.727
"Vote for the man who had
the PM at his table."

41:29.728 --> 41:32.227
- I'm not being overly ambitious?
- Oh, no such thing.

41:33.394 --> 41:35.428
Let's see what we can manage, George.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.226
Ladies.

41:37.227 --> 41:40.027
He chose well, your son.

41:40.594 --> 41:42.861
I'll be here in the morning
to see you discharged.

41:44.227 --> 41:45.326
We'll meet for dinner.

41:45.327 --> 41:46.660
I'll make the arrangements.

41:46.661 --> 41:48.760
Well, thank her, man.

41:50.127 --> 41:52.160
Thank you for thinking of my campaign.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.860
Of you.

41:53.861 --> 41:55.994
A kiss wouldn't kill you.

42:01.594 --> 42:02.760
I should bloody think so.

42:02.761 --> 42:05.327
That sort of thing is
gold with the voters.

42:14.594 --> 42:17.327
It's such a shame your health
prevents you attending.

42:17.861 --> 42:19.326
Well, if it happens.

42:19.327 --> 42:20.594
It will.

42:21.994 --> 42:24.994
As I say, pity you're infirm.

42:38.027 --> 42:40.161
Nurse!

42:45.828 --> 42:52.127
Trouble is only really trouble,
um, if no good comes of it.

42:55.594 --> 42:58.361
We've both been circling
around this for too long.

43:00.394 --> 43:02.361
The whole marriage business.

43:03.227 --> 43:04.527
You know... Where would we live?

43:04.528 --> 43:07.327
How is it gonna work?
This, that, the other.

43:10.027 --> 43:13.860
You know what last night
and today proved?

43:13.861 --> 43:15.027
What?

43:16.194 --> 43:17.993
Mongrel can't hurt us.

43:22.027 --> 43:23.460
And you like watching me work.

43:23.461 --> 43:25.226
That's... That's marriage talk to me.

43:33.461 --> 43:35.127
Let's set a date.

43:37.194 --> 43:39.994
After the election so we don't
steal George's thunder.

43:42.795 --> 43:44.728
Husband and wife.

43:46.795 --> 43:49.561
All the rest will happen in time.

43:57.828 --> 43:59.227
Yes?

43:59.795 --> 44:01.194
Yes.

44:01.261 --> 44:02.560
Yes?

44:02.561 --> 44:03.593
Yes.

44:20.394 --> 44:25.993
<i>Zeramtam shena yihyu
ba'boker ke'hasir yahalof.</i>

44:25.994 --> 44:27.460
<i>Ba'boker yasitz ve'halaf...</i>

44:29.628 --> 44:34.127
Just set up a couple of
cold ones on the veranda.

44:35.227 --> 44:36.427
Sorry.

44:36.428 --> 44:38.194
It's fine.

44:38.994 --> 44:40.994
Having a bit of a chat, eh?

44:41.461 --> 44:43.994
Sometimes it helps
to feel he's near.

44:45.227 --> 44:47.127
Well, it's there where you want it.

44:49.761 --> 44:52.461
That copper Taylor get
what he was after?

44:53.194 --> 44:55.761
He's more obnoxious
than Franklin ever was.

44:56.261 --> 44:57.860
I'm in your corner. You know that.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.461
If that helps.

44:59.994 --> 45:00.994
My hero.

45:02.661 --> 45:03.761
Any time.

45:09.394 --> 45:11.261
Actually, it might help.

45:12.828 --> 45:15.794
He'll never make a case against you.

45:15.795 --> 45:18.827
Or Regina, sadly, even
if he was inclined.

45:21.227 --> 45:23.627
This stuff that she's got on you...

45:23.628 --> 45:25.227
Deeply private.

45:30.027 --> 45:31.727
But as much as I'd prefer no one knew,

45:31.728 --> 45:35.161
she could tell the world if
it meant seeing her charged.

45:35.628 --> 45:37.060
But it won't.

45:38.027 --> 45:40.994
Not without a lot more than
supposition against her.

45:41.795 --> 45:43.361
So what can you do?

45:46.361 --> 45:49.527
Back off. Let her think she's safe.

45:49.528 --> 45:51.127
And then?

45:52.461 --> 45:54.661
Call in the heavy artillery.

46:17.661 --> 46:19.427
- Done?
- And dusted.

46:19.428 --> 46:20.860
Thank you for your assistance.

46:20.861 --> 46:21.993
It was a grand idea.

46:21.994 --> 46:24.593
Old Lizzie looked like
she'd sucked on a lemon.

46:24.594 --> 46:28.126
I'll deliver her an entire
citrus orchard before I'm done.

46:28.127 --> 46:30.427
Hopefully it will
promote another attack.

46:30.428 --> 46:32.260
Remind me never to cross you.

46:32.261 --> 46:33.226
You should go.

46:33.227 --> 46:35.160
We don't want George
suspecting collusion.

46:35.161 --> 46:36.593
Well, it's for his own benefit.

46:36.594 --> 46:39.161
He's best left with the
illusion of being at the wheel.

46:41.194 --> 46:43.627
This answers one question.

46:43.628 --> 46:46.660
I always wondered how someone
piss-weak like Charles

46:46.661 --> 46:47.761
ever made a mark.

46:48.261 --> 46:49.993
Well, behind every good man...

46:49.994 --> 46:51.728
Is a bad woman?

46:52.361 --> 46:54.528
Well, bad in a good way.

46:56.761 --> 46:58.194
Of course.

47:00.394 --> 47:02.660
She's so hideous.

47:02.661 --> 47:04.760
How can Father marry someone like that?

47:04.761 --> 47:06.560
Can't he see through that mask?

47:06.561 --> 47:09.126
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.461
Ah. Thank you.

47:13.861 --> 47:15.160
Very good.

47:17.227 --> 47:20.427
Well, he can see through the
mask, but others can't.

47:20.428 --> 47:22.827
And she may well have
secured George's election

47:22.828 --> 47:23.794
with this dinner.

47:23.795 --> 47:26.360
Her mask is well in place.

47:26.361 --> 47:30.026
Let's go back tomorrow,
then, help to loosen it.

47:31.795 --> 47:33.428
Tempting, but not yet.

47:34.661 --> 47:36.194
Soon.

47:36.994 --> 47:39.227
Timing, my darling.

47:39.828 --> 47:41.161
Timing is everything.

48:13.027 --> 48:15.126
Is there anything I can get you, Miss?

48:15.127 --> 48:16.993
Oh! Rose.

48:16.994 --> 48:18.560
Uh, no.

48:18.561 --> 48:20.261
That'll be all. Thank you.

48:20.994 --> 48:23.127
What's this song called, Miss?

48:23.861 --> 48:25.393
"The Beauty of Love."

48:25.394 --> 48:27.026
Oh.

48:27.027 --> 48:28.727
Would you take it off, please?

48:28.728 --> 48:30.460
Yes, Miss.

48:32.761 --> 48:33.994
Good night, Rose.

48:34.561 --> 48:36.460
<i>Buona notte,</i> Miss.

48:58.161 --> 48:59.760
You mustn't be cross.

48:59.761 --> 49:02.627
I'd come to check with you,
but there was Sir Richard.

49:02.628 --> 49:04.860
My enthusiasm got the better of me.

49:04.861 --> 49:07.027
Thankfully, it's all come together.

49:07.661 --> 49:09.993
- We have them?
- Wednesday next.

49:09.994 --> 49:13.193
Oh, George! A triumph!

49:13.194 --> 49:14.527
It is.

49:14.528 --> 49:17.227
Oh, your success is my success.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.794
We may only be a political partnership,

49:25.795 --> 49:28.461
but what a formidable one we shall be.

49:29.060 --> 49:30.861
Champagne.

49:36.127 --> 49:38.628
Sit down, you silly mongrel.

49:50.861 --> 49:51.994
What do you want?

49:52.461 --> 49:53.993
I've got no quarrel with you.

49:53.994 --> 49:55.560
And you shouldn't have
with her, neither.

49:55.561 --> 49:57.127
What can I do for you, Sergeant?

49:59.161 --> 50:02.993
When you got one unsolved case,
you dig through the rest,

50:02.994 --> 50:05.059
look for patterns.

50:05.060 --> 50:06.060
Found one.

50:07.528 --> 50:09.261
A Bert Ford.

50:09.861 --> 50:12.528
Headed off, they say,
but no one's seen him.

50:12.994 --> 50:14.994
Wasn't a friend of yours.

50:17.194 --> 50:19.593
His mate reckons you slapped him down.

50:19.594 --> 50:21.193
And not girlie, either.

50:21.194 --> 50:23.593
I had no cause to like him.

50:23.594 --> 50:24.760
Any to get rid of him?

50:24.761 --> 50:25.860
Now, listen here, Sergeant...

50:25.861 --> 50:29.993
No one goes missing without a reason.

50:29.994 --> 50:31.593
And people are unlucky around you.

50:31.594 --> 50:34.461
If you're asking if I
killed Bert Ford, no.

50:35.327 --> 50:37.360
Maybe Mrs. Bligh knocked
him off as well, eh?

50:37.361 --> 50:38.561
Open your eyes, son.

50:39.327 --> 50:41.226
My money's on the Commie
Yid for both of them.

50:41.227 --> 50:42.193
Cop or no cop,

50:42.194 --> 50:44.528
- I'm gonna deck you right now.
- Roy. Roy!

50:44.994 --> 50:46.993
I <i>am</i> Jewish.

50:46.994 --> 50:50.361
And my politics are left-wing,
and I'm proud of both.

50:50.828 --> 50:51.760
Now, get out,

50:51.761 --> 50:54.060
and don't come back unless
you have an arrest warrant.

50:55.594 --> 50:57.227
You heard her.

51:03.994 --> 51:05.728
You've backed the wrong horse, mate.

51:06.994 --> 51:10.326
Better than a bob each way on a mongrel.

51:21.060 --> 51:22.528
Bert Ford.
