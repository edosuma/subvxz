03:00.187 --> 03:01.889
Hey, hey guys.

03:02.588 --> 03:03.591
What's up.

03:04.857 --> 03:06.194
You got the stuff?

03:06.627 --> 03:07.726
Yup.

03:07.728 --> 03:09.029
Alright, oh, baby.

03:12.064 --> 03:12.966
What'll it be?

03:28.949 --> 03:31.615
Alright, that
looks good, how much is it?

03:31.617 --> 03:32.250
That's all you want?

03:32.252 --> 03:33.952
Yeah.

03:33.954 --> 03:34.953
Mmm, 20 bucks.

03:34.955 --> 03:35.790
20 bucks?

03:42.962 --> 03:44.095
I got 17.

03:44.097 --> 03:46.931
17, alright, that'll do.

03:46.933 --> 03:47.899
Thanks, man.

03:47.901 --> 03:48.733
Alright, man.

03:48.735 --> 03:49.737
Bye.

11:11.678 --> 11:12.645
How'd it go?

11:14.179 --> 11:15.015
You know,

11:16.482 --> 11:19.185
she sat on my face, which
was this complete surprise

11:20.587 --> 11:22.957
but I think, in the end,
it's gonna be kinda special.

11:39.271 --> 11:42.443
Five
minutes everyone.

11:50.650 --> 11:51.684
Jules.

12:01.727 --> 12:02.527
Hey, baby.

12:02.529 --> 12:03.364
Hey.

12:44.303 --> 12:45.702
Hey.

12:45.704 --> 12:47.540
You should really
lock the door, Jules.

12:48.741 --> 12:49.742
It's a bad habit.

15:26.531 --> 15:27.364
Hey.

15:27.366 --> 15:28.202
Hey, Margueritte.

15:34.340 --> 15:35.542
How much do I owe you?

15:41.948 --> 15:42.816
Oh, um,

15:44.549 --> 15:45.385
it's three.

16:03.568 --> 16:04.404
You okay?

16:06.039 --> 16:07.540
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

16:09.608 --> 16:12.909
You can come
out with us later, if you want.

16:12.911 --> 16:14.380
Oh, okay, yeah, maybe.

16:18.483 --> 16:21.921
Somebody should really cast
me as your mother in a scene.

16:23.356 --> 16:25.755
Reality, you know,
young guy, teenager,

16:25.757 --> 16:27.026
some mother daughter action.

16:29.028 --> 16:30.327
Yeah, yeah.

16:30.329 --> 16:31.061
Yeah.

16:31.063 --> 16:32.031
I'll bring it up to Larry.

17:07.934 --> 17:08.769
Hey.

17:12.438 --> 17:16.575
Have a good day.

17:30.156 --> 17:31.655
Hi.

17:31.657 --> 17:32.492
Hey.

17:33.659 --> 17:35.592
What, are you
covering for Theo?

17:35.594 --> 17:36.429
Yep.

17:39.131 --> 17:39.966
Baby?

17:41.133 --> 17:41.967
Uh-huh?

17:47.939 --> 17:48.775
What?

17:52.078 --> 17:54.481
Do you ever think about
starting your own bar?

17:56.149 --> 17:56.983
What?

17:58.851 --> 18:00.353
I don't know,
don't you want to?

18:01.086 --> 18:02.621
Not really, no.

18:03.723 --> 18:05.125
I think you'd be good at it.

18:06.057 --> 18:08.394
Yeah, maybe I would.

18:09.795 --> 18:10.828
I don't know, that's
something I'd have

18:10.830 --> 18:13.129
to think about, you know?

18:13.131 --> 18:16.135
Plus, I'm pretty happy with
the way things are right now.

18:17.136 --> 18:18.372
You know?

18:21.573 --> 18:22.409
Oh.

18:31.918 --> 18:32.953
Rough day at work?

18:40.192 --> 18:41.658
Oh, come on, don't be sulky.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.397
I'll be
sulky if I want to.

19:24.035 --> 19:24.871
Hello?

19:27.005 --> 19:28.140
Are you alright?

19:35.547 --> 19:36.615
Are you okay?

20:56.728 --> 20:59.665
Tub, sink, toilet.

22:05.331 --> 22:06.166
Okay?

22:07.432 --> 22:08.267
Okay?

22:51.976 --> 22:54.378
Are you
gonna finish that?

22:54.380 --> 22:55.281
No, you want it?

23:04.090 --> 23:06.226
You were really good
in your scene today.

23:07.325 --> 23:08.294
So were you, Shy.

23:10.028 --> 23:11.330
I had to pee the whole time.

23:13.399 --> 23:14.868
Well, you looked great.

23:16.201 --> 23:17.036
Thanks.

23:22.240 --> 23:23.075
Excuse me.

23:25.311 --> 23:28.881
Are you Richard Harrison's
daughter, by chance?

23:30.783 --> 23:32.385
Oh my god, Mrs. Phan.

23:33.252 --> 23:34.187
I thought that was you.

23:35.787 --> 23:40.693
Hi, Dorothy taught me
piano for several years,

23:41.427 --> 23:43.096
way back when.

23:44.496 --> 23:45.331
Oh, Julie Harrison.

23:47.332 --> 23:49.436
Oh, I almost didn't
recognize you.

23:50.436 --> 23:51.471
It's me.

23:54.473 --> 23:56.506
Are you still
playing the piano?

23:56.508 --> 24:00.543
You had quite a bit of
Richard's talent, as I recall.

24:00.545 --> 24:01.814
I never stopped.

24:04.416 --> 24:07.821
I play from time to time,
when I have time.

24:10.089 --> 24:12.822
Oh, I'm glad to hear it.

24:12.824 --> 24:15.926
You know, we're holding
a competition this month

24:15.928 --> 24:19.228
for the conservatory's
line up for next year.

24:19.230 --> 24:20.363
The conservatory?

24:20.365 --> 24:22.064
That's right.

24:22.066 --> 24:24.737
I would love to
hear you play again.

24:25.938 --> 24:29.309
You did the Chopin
"Prelude", right?

24:30.909 --> 24:32.408
Why don't you bring it in?

24:32.410 --> 24:34.511
We'll see what you got,

24:34.513 --> 24:37.382
you are Richard Harrison's
daughter, after all.

24:39.185 --> 24:40.551
It's an entrance competition?

24:40.553 --> 24:42.822
That's
right, for next year.

24:46.425 --> 24:47.293
I'll do that.

24:48.994 --> 24:49.829
Oh, good.

24:52.198 --> 24:54.033
It was very nice
to see you, Julie.

24:56.569 --> 24:58.471
I hope you're taking
care of yourself.

25:03.942 --> 25:05.410
She seems nice.

25:16.589 --> 25:18.491
Mrs. Phan, Mrs. Phan?

25:19.490 --> 25:20.325
Hey,

25:22.093 --> 25:22.761
sorry, when?

25:24.929 --> 25:26.996
Oh, of course,
it's on the 21st

25:26.998 --> 25:29.131
at the conservatory
on 7th Avenue.

25:29.133 --> 25:29.968
Okay, great.

25:30.936 --> 25:33.136
I'll add your name
to the list and you can

25:33.138 --> 25:34.474
check in at the front desk.

25:35.541 --> 25:38.108
We start at 9 AM, okay?

25:38.110 --> 25:38.911
Great.

25:40.612 --> 25:41.447
Thank you.

25:43.916 --> 25:44.551
See you.

27:01.159 --> 27:02.693
Look after her today?

27:02.695 --> 27:03.996
I have to go to class.

27:17.743 --> 27:19.544
Just look after her today, okay?

27:24.650 --> 27:25.685
Okay.

32:40.998 --> 32:41.933
You know,

32:42.935 --> 32:44.904
things with my wife just
haven't been the same

32:46.604 --> 32:47.837
but then out there on the field,

32:47.839 --> 32:51.907
goddamn it, I saw you
and I knew, I want you.

32:51.909 --> 32:53.545
I wanna be in you.

32:58.984 --> 33:00.453
That's your line, Julianna.

33:01.519 --> 33:02.452
I'm sorry,

33:02.454 --> 33:03.990
I'm sorry, can we take it back?

33:05.090 --> 33:07.659
Alright, take
it from my wife, Brian.

33:08.794 --> 33:09.926
You cool, Jules?

33:09.928 --> 33:11.964
It's okay, go ahead.

33:15.499 --> 33:17.869
Things with my wife
just haven't been the same

33:19.504 --> 33:21.905
but then I was out
on the field today

33:21.907 --> 33:25.044
and I saw you and
I knew right then,

33:25.910 --> 33:27.779
I fucking want you, god.

33:32.417 --> 33:33.319
I wanna be in you.

33:34.919 --> 33:36.921
I've never been
with a man before.

33:38.689 --> 33:40.592
Will it, will it hurt?

33:41.993 --> 33:44.030
I'm gonna go
straight for the end zone.

33:44.963 --> 33:47.500
Great,
great, great, great.

35:10.148 --> 35:11.383
And you cut...

37:55.079 --> 37:59.250
With these mirrors,
it's difficult to tell.

38:01.986 --> 38:04.557
You are aiming at
me, aren't you?

38:05.889 --> 38:07.892
I'm aiming at you, lover.

38:22.273 --> 38:24.276
Oh my god, it's so cold.

39:26.371 --> 39:28.037
Yes.

39:28.039 --> 39:29.104
Girl after my own
heart, what's your name?

39:29.106 --> 39:32.041
My friend's call me
Shy Girl 'cause you know,

39:32.043 --> 39:35.343
I'm a little shy but
my real name is Annie.

39:35.345 --> 39:36.778
I like that.

39:36.780 --> 39:37.946
What do you do, Annie?

39:37.948 --> 39:40.785
Well, I'm a
performer, actually.

39:42.352 --> 39:43.720
Mostly a dancer.

39:43.722 --> 39:45.088
Wow, that's cool.

39:45.090 --> 39:46.289
I work in finance.

39:46.291 --> 39:48.224
It's very exciting.

39:48.226 --> 39:51.861
That is exciting,
what kind of finance stuff?

39:51.863 --> 39:54.296
Hash fund trading,
my firm has about 100 million

39:54.298 --> 39:56.298
in assets under management
and we like to exploit

39:56.300 --> 39:59.334
whatever opportunities
we can find in the market

39:59.336 --> 40:02.137
to get the highest
active return or alpha.

40:02.139 --> 40:03.805
How do you do that?

40:03.807 --> 40:04.506
Do you have a half an
hour for me to explain

40:04.508 --> 40:05.777
it to you?

40:07.044 --> 40:08.443
Two Macallan's on
the rocks, please.

40:08.445 --> 40:10.213
It's all arbitrage strategies,

40:10.215 --> 40:12.448
we look at everything we
can from stocks, bonds,

40:12.450 --> 40:13.718
mutual funds...

40:19.323 --> 40:20.124
Thank you.

40:30.968 --> 40:32.371
I know where I know you from.

40:33.505 --> 40:36.104
Triple Exorcist, right?

40:36.106 --> 40:39.177
You're that girl, you're
the possessed girl.

40:40.244 --> 40:42.213
Satan, guide my cock.

40:44.448 --> 40:46.184
Exorcize
my cunt.

40:51.055 --> 40:54.259
You were so hot in that.

41:04.468 --> 41:06.003
Do you wanna split a cab?

42:36.628 --> 42:37.459
Hi.

42:37.461 --> 42:38.296
Hi.

42:39.396 --> 42:41.833
Yesterday, I wasn't
quite myself.

42:57.180 --> 42:58.015
Oh.

43:06.590 --> 43:07.425
Okay.

44:12.724 --> 44:14.258
I like this body

44:15.693 --> 44:17.930
and I think I like whiskey.

44:19.664 --> 44:22.530
I think I like it too.

45:30.601 --> 45:32.200
Hey.

45:32.202 --> 45:33.037
Hey.

45:34.104 --> 45:35.336
Morning.

45:35.338 --> 45:36.173
Morning.

45:37.374 --> 45:38.776
Sorry, this is all I've got.

45:41.445 --> 45:42.447
Thank you.

45:46.249 --> 45:46.883
I need coffee.

45:49.186 --> 45:49.852
Do you want me to go get some?

45:49.854 --> 45:50.686
Oh no.

45:50.688 --> 45:52.320
Are you sure?

45:52.322 --> 45:53.155
It's fine.

45:53.157 --> 45:54.159
I'm sorry.

46:08.840 --> 46:11.740
Not exactly a
breakfast of champions.

46:11.742 --> 46:12.575
That's okay.

46:12.577 --> 46:13.412
Sorry.

46:19.851 --> 46:21.253
You live here by yourself?

46:22.586 --> 46:24.486
Uh no, with my boyfriend.

46:24.488 --> 46:26.191
Things have kind of been...

46:37.501 --> 46:40.639
I actually have to go.

46:46.711 --> 46:47.712
I want to see you again.

46:50.680 --> 46:51.515
Would you like that?

46:53.217 --> 46:55.153
Yeah,
yeah, I would.

47:03.827 --> 47:04.727
Bye.

47:04.729 --> 47:05.764
Bye.

47:16.273 --> 47:17.441
Fuckin' fruity loops.

54:11.055 --> 54:11.890
Shit.

54:16.059 --> 54:16.992
Hello?

54:16.994 --> 54:18.225
It's Karen.

54:18.227 --> 54:19.530
Oh hey, come on
up, door's open.

54:33.343 --> 54:34.175
Hey.

54:34.177 --> 54:35.611
Hey.

54:35.613 --> 54:37.312
I'm sorry, I just
got back from a shoot.

54:37.314 --> 54:38.613
I'm early,
it's okay.

54:38.615 --> 54:40.615
Okay, you can sit down,

54:40.617 --> 54:42.783
I just need to
freshen up real quick

54:42.785 --> 54:44.054
and then we can go.

54:45.255 --> 54:46.291
No problem.

54:47.323 --> 54:50.057
Okay, can I get you something?

54:50.059 --> 54:50.892
I'm fine.

54:50.894 --> 54:52.160
A drink?

54:52.162 --> 54:53.928
Okay well, there's the
bar, so help yourself,

54:53.930 --> 54:57.164
if you'd like and
I'll be five minutes.

54:57.166 --> 54:59.036
There's no rush,
don't worry about it.

55:40.410 --> 55:41.242
Oh hey.

55:41.244 --> 55:42.910
You selling this?

55:42.912 --> 55:43.747
Hmm?

55:44.947 --> 55:45.881
What the
fuck are you doing?

55:45.883 --> 55:47.115
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

55:47.117 --> 55:48.450
what the fuck, stop
it, stop it, stop it,

55:48.452 --> 55:49.950
what the fuck!

55:50.887 --> 55:52.153
Are you fucking kidding me,

55:52.155 --> 55:54.025
what the fuck is wrong with you?

55:54.925 --> 55:56.191
Calm down.

55:56.193 --> 55:57.725
What the fuck,
you fucking psycho.

55:57.727 --> 55:59.428
What the fuck, are you
gonna fucking pay for this?

55:59.430 --> 56:01.262
You should
be thanking me.

56:01.264 --> 56:03.634
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

56:04.401 --> 56:06.300
Get the fuck out
of my apartment,

56:06.302 --> 56:08.870
get the fuck out of
my fucking apartment,

56:08.872 --> 56:12.644
get the fuck out, get
the, fuck you, fuck you!

56:13.811 --> 56:16.213
You fucking psycho, fuck you!

56:18.849 --> 56:20.017
Fuck me, fuck!

56:28.325 --> 56:29.957
It's not that I'm
angry, Max, believe me,

56:29.959 --> 56:32.697
this shit happens
24 fucking seven,

56:34.131 --> 56:37.168
it's just I'm disappointed,
consistently disappointed.

56:38.501 --> 56:42.336
Look, the freelance
life is about the A's,

56:42.338 --> 56:45.273
availability,
affordability, affability.

56:45.275 --> 56:47.374
You're definitely available,
you're a part time

56:47.376 --> 56:49.410
fucking bartender,

56:49.412 --> 56:51.512
you were affordable,
when you delivered

56:51.514 --> 56:53.414
and didn't cost me
an arm and a leg

56:53.416 --> 56:55.283
having to make up for
your incompetence.

56:55.285 --> 56:57.184
I know, I'm really...

56:57.186 --> 56:59.019
Shut the fuck up, I'm
gonna let this one go

56:59.021 --> 57:01.856
because it wasn't that
much fucking shit but

57:01.858 --> 57:06.861
I'm going to politely ask
you to step the fuck up

57:06.863 --> 57:09.765
because you're hardly
my employee of the month

57:09.767 --> 57:11.269
right now, capeesh?

57:12.468 --> 57:17.474
So, I got another gig
for you because I'm Saint

57:18.207 --> 57:20.077
fucking Nicholas, okay?

57:23.780 --> 57:26.414
Great, awesome,
thank you so much, Lou.

57:26.416 --> 57:28.149
I appreciate it.

57:28.151 --> 57:29.350
Let's go.

57:29.352 --> 57:30.954
I won't let you down, man.

57:47.003 --> 57:48.739
I'm sorry, Max.

57:51.441 --> 57:52.510
I didn't know.

57:53.343 --> 57:54.479
It was a stupid thing.

57:57.014 --> 57:58.146
I didn't mean to
fuck anything up,

57:58.148 --> 58:00.115
you have to believe me.

58:00.117 --> 58:01.883
Yeah.

58:01.885 --> 58:03.053
Well, you did.

01:01:07.637 --> 01:01:08.572
Ow, fuck!

01:03:20.769 --> 01:03:21.805
Oh, fuck!

01:03:58.374 --> 01:04:00.643
Excuse me, do you know
where the bathroom is?

01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:48.758
Please take a seat.

01:05:11.014 --> 01:05:13.347
What is that?

01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:15.350
Oh, it's my music.

01:05:15.352 --> 01:05:17.254
You're not off book?

01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:18.956
No.

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:23.593
It's alright,
Julianna, continue.

01:06:36.999 --> 01:06:38.936
Thank you, Julianna.

01:07:13.503 --> 01:07:14.571
Fuck, fuck.

01:07:32.789 --> 01:07:35.655
Julianna, how
you feeling today?

01:07:35.657 --> 01:07:36.758
I'm fine, Larry, how are you?

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:37.992
Great, great, great.

01:07:37.994 --> 01:07:40.026
So, we wanna try and
get this in one take,

01:07:40.028 --> 01:07:42.729
okay, for the experiential guys,

01:07:42.731 --> 01:07:44.999
kind of a choose your
own adventure thing.

01:07:45.001 --> 01:07:49.035
So, you're on a school trip
with the football team.

01:07:49.037 --> 01:07:51.071
Can I ask you a question?

01:07:51.073 --> 01:07:52.108
Sure.

01:07:53.843 --> 01:07:55.846
Do you remember why
you got into this?

01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.016
I mean, instead
of anything else,

01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:06.622
'cause it was easy,
'cause of the money?

01:08:10.626 --> 01:08:12.496
I can't remember
why I got into it,

01:08:15.764 --> 01:08:17.468
instead of anything else.

01:08:21.069 --> 01:08:22.473
I guess I just found me,

01:08:23.706 --> 01:08:26.142
you know, in the path of least
of resistance or something.

01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:30.080
It's so simple,

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:32.582
what we do.

01:08:34.116 --> 01:08:38.020
It's... it's so,

01:08:40.823 --> 01:08:42.158
it's so boring.

01:08:44.661 --> 01:08:46.997
We don't bring any
beauty into this world.

01:08:49.631 --> 01:08:53.133
It's just sex, we don't
bring anything of ourselves,

01:08:53.135 --> 01:08:54.702
it's just bodies.

01:08:54.703 --> 01:08:55.538
Okay.

01:08:56.805 --> 01:08:58.107
You know what,
you're being silly.

01:09:00.143 --> 01:09:01.211
Julianna, you're good at this.

01:09:03.545 --> 01:09:05.078
Now, I don't know about
bringing beauty into the world

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.017
or whatever the hell else,
but you are good at this.

01:09:09.251 --> 01:09:11.651
Most people don't have the
time or energy to think

01:09:11.653 --> 01:09:13.924
about bringing beauty
into the world but you,

01:09:15.258 --> 01:09:16.693
you are lucky.

01:09:18.495 --> 01:09:19.696
You're good at something

01:09:20.629 --> 01:09:22.031
and people enjoy it.

01:09:25.033 --> 01:09:28.100
You know, it's not an awful
way to spend your life.

01:09:28.103 --> 01:09:30.206
I've been doing it
since I was a teenager.

01:09:34.877 --> 01:09:37.080
All I'm saying is,
it's not so bad.

01:09:39.781 --> 01:09:40.616
Right?

01:10:09.545 --> 01:10:10.179
Ready.

01:10:42.344 --> 01:10:44.780
Things with my wife
just haven't been the same

01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:50.187
and I saw you out on the
field and I knew, I want you.

01:10:57.994 --> 01:10:59.662
I want to be in you.

01:11:02.197 --> 01:11:04.864
I've never
been with a man before.

01:11:04.866 --> 01:11:06.769
Will it... will it hurt?

01:14:00.108 --> 01:14:01.210
You're Julianna Fox.

01:14:15.124 --> 01:14:16.492
I don't have a twin.

01:14:18.059 --> 01:14:18.894
No.

01:14:21.464 --> 01:14:26.001
I've seen you, looking
at me in the mirror.

01:14:27.402 --> 01:14:31.307
I've been looking
for you, for your face.

01:14:34.509 --> 01:14:35.510
You've already got it.

01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:43.419
You're a strange people,
unique in this universe.

01:14:45.153 --> 01:14:46.423
I hope you know that.

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.496
I've seen you as well.

01:14:59.468 --> 01:15:05.008
My not twin, my ether,

01:15:06.608 --> 01:15:09.146
the other of my selves.

01:15:12.281 --> 01:15:15.352
I've seen you through
the looking glass.

01:15:18.187 --> 01:15:20.557
Would you like to see
what's on the other side?

01:15:30.299 --> 01:15:31.535
Do you want some water?

01:15:37.572 --> 01:15:38.575
Thank you.

01:15:59.527 --> 01:16:00.530
I'm tired.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.036
Such a strange thing.

01:16:09.071 --> 01:16:11.140
A body that grows weak, why?

01:20:26.139 --> 01:20:31.139
