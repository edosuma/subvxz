<i>‐ In part one of this</i>
<i>"Dear Christmas" episode,</i>

00:13.180 --> 00:15.516
we explored all the trappings
of the Christmas season‐‐

00:15.641 --> 00:16.975
cutting down the tree,

00:17.059 --> 00:19.144
drinking hot cocoa,
putting up the lights,

00:19.269 --> 00:22.231
<i>decorating the house,</i>
<i>the ugly sweater party.</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:25.359
<i>It's the perfect backdrop</i>
<i>to fall in love.</i>

00:25.484 --> 00:27.861
<i>But is it love?</i>
<i>Or is the season?</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:29.279
<i>Are you really falling</i>
<i>in love,</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:31.323
<i>or are you just in love</i>
<i>with Christmas?</i>

00:31.406 --> 00:33.825
Maybe when the snow melts,
you'll fall out of love,

00:33.951 --> 00:37.079
and it's over,
like a seasonal allergy.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.164
Holiday love is very
complicated at Christmas.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.583
You can't just crack it
that easily.

00:41.708 --> 00:45.629
That's why we're gonna continue
this episode next week, live.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.131
I'll be talking about
the magical, elusive gift

00:48.257 --> 00:51.093
that is very hard to wrap:
true love.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.386
So if you have
a true love story

00:52.511 --> 00:54.930

00:55.013 --> 00:58.225

00:58.350 --> 01:00.018
I'll be livestreaming
part two from a place

01:00.143 --> 01:03.105
I truly love,
my childhood home.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.066
Until then, Dear Christmas,
this is Natalie Morgan,

01:06.191 --> 01:07.859
reminding you
to enjoy the season,

01:07.985 --> 01:11.154

too many cookies.

going on out there?

‐ Oh, I know.

01:30.215 --> 01:31.967
But I really have
to get on the road soon.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.802

[both laugh]

01:41.852 --> 01:44.021
Oh, wow!

02:16.887 --> 02:18.764
‐ Oh, it's for my dad.
I had it special ordered.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.683
‐ Does your dad love
Lake Tahoe Books?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.185
‐ Um, he better.
He owns it.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.771
Yeah, with my mom.
They just bought it.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.814

Well, she's having a baby.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.866
Actually, it's due
on Christmas Eve.

Oh, I hate to think of

‐ Well, that is for me.
‐ It's hideous.

02:46.041 --> 02:47.209

Well, my parents have

02:47.334 --> 02:48.794
an ugly sweater party
every year,

02:48.877 --> 02:50.003
and there's a contest

02:50.128 --> 02:51.463
for who wears
the ugliest sweater.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.298
‐ I think you're gonna
definitely win this year.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.717
‐ Aw, thanks.
I'm trying.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.261
Ah, I can't wait to go home
for Christmas.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.138
My parents go all out
with the decorations,

03:00.222 --> 03:01.973
and the house is so lit up

03:02.099 --> 03:03.642
that you can probably see it
from space.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.977
‐ Well, I will look for it
when I go out to space.

03:06.061 --> 03:09.022
Oh, fancy.

03:09.147 --> 03:13.193
Who'd you buy this for?
A special someone?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.070
‐ No, I didn't buy it.
It's from one of our sponsors.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.655
And it's for my brother‐in‐law.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.199
‐ Oh, I thought maybe you had
someone tucked away

03:19.324 --> 03:21.326
in Lake Tahoe.
A hometown honey?

03:21.451 --> 03:24.162
‐ Uh, that's a big, fat no.
‐ Really?

03:24.287 --> 03:26.039
I've never seen you date
anyone around here,

03:26.164 --> 03:28.542
so I guess I figured
you had someone there.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.421
You've been in love before,
right?

03:32.504 --> 03:35.006
‐ Yeah, I've been in love
a bunch of times.

03:35.132 --> 03:38.009
I just‐‐you know,
never found my "true love."

03:38.135 --> 03:39.469
‐ So you don't believe
in true love?

03:39.594 --> 03:40.887
‐ No, I do.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.682
You know, for other people,
just not really for me.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.978
Are you gonna help me
wrap or what?

03:48.061 --> 03:49.521
‐ Ted and I broke up.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.481
‐ Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.609
‐ He was a quintessential
boyfriend till he wasn't.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.069

you should give

03:56.194 --> 03:58.155
Hank in HR a chance.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.489
You know, nothing wrong
with a workplace romance,

03:59.573 --> 04:02.200
as long as the paperwork's
signed.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.661
‐ I thought I was in love.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.246
‐ And you probably were.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.457
You know, but maybe
he just wasn't your true love.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.084
‐ Well, what's the difference
between love and true love?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.586
Aren't they all the same?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.630
‐ Of course not.
Don't you listen to my podcast?

04:15.756 --> 04:18.008
‐ No, I have million
other people do that for me.

04:18.133 --> 04:19.885
‐ [scoffs]

04:20.010 --> 04:22.053
Well, you know, true love is

04:22.179 --> 04:24.389
when two people
find each other.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.725
And those two worlds
come together as one,

04:26.850 --> 04:31.313
and all those people want
is to be together,

04:31.396 --> 04:33.315
you know, no matter
how tough things get,

04:33.398 --> 04:37.486
you just‐‐you can't imagine
your life without them.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.863

listening to your podcast.

My brother died unexpectedly.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.309
He left a wife,
two small children.

she doesn't want to settle

and she says

31:30.514 --> 31:34.351
