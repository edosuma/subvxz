The first time I threw
mine away, I thought
it was an ant trap.

But I figured I'd
rather Iive with ants

00:28.361 --> 00:30.237

creepy little disk.

The second time,
I thought it was
one of those,

you know,
the things you turn over
and it moos like a cow thing,

00:38.288 --> 00:43.876
but upon closer examination
it was another ant trap,
so I threw it away.

And the third time,
I did it out of spite.

The power dynamic.

Well, you were
surprisingly restrained.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.578
We will be well
rested tomorrow.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.662
Okay. That's great, actually,

10:22.747 --> 10:24.623

to talk to you

10:32.298 --> 10:33.965
Kind of hoping
it catches on.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.925
Anyway, the question is,

10:36.010 --> 10:38.803
what is the best
way to disseminate
important information

10:38.888 --> 10:40.180
in an efficient way?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.767
Right. So let's. . .

10:44.018 --> 10:45.810
Finally, there's
a provision here
in the occurrence

10:45.895 --> 10:47.646
that the child is
born an old man,

10:47.730 --> 10:48.688
à la Benjamin Button.

Same page. We're fine there.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.025
Just keep moving.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.693
Despite
the provision covering

10:53.778 --> 10:55.362
whether this is all
part of The Matrix. . .

10:55.529 --> 10:56.905
Which we can't know. . .

10:57.239 --> 10:58.281
. . .this is essentially. . .

10:58.366 --> 10:59.366
. . .unless we're unplugged. . .

. . .and wake up in the future.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.122
. . .which is
actually pretty common.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.501
So, l have to tell you
that this is
a solid contract.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.087
What?

11:12.171 --> 11:15.090
Look, l can't enforce
that anybody have a child
with anyone else.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.299
What?

11:16.384 --> 11:18.968
MEDlATOR: So essentially
this comes down to damages.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.764
Now, there is some precedence
for the range of $30,000.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.265
What?

11:24.350 --> 11:26.935
l don't have
$30,000 lying around.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.353
l have it buried very deeply,

11:28.437 --> 11:31.272
and l don't want to dig past
a certain someone to get it.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.859
Chase Dixon is up,
could be a big play.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.027
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.404
l know it's like cricket.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.697
No. No.

He didn't even do anything.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.333

11:50.543 --> 11:51.543
l bet he does that at home.

11:51.627 --> 11:55.004
l bet it's like, "Hey,
Donna, why don't you
wash the dishes?

11:55.089 --> 11:56.548
"High five, Donna."

11:56.632 --> 12:00.427
"Hey, why don't you bring
me my slippers? High five.
l'm taking all the credit."

12:00.511 --> 12:02.262
He seems pretty
well liked by the team.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.682
Okay, well, that's because
he's paying their salary.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.935
You do know
that high school coaches
don't pay their players.

12:09.019 --> 12:10.979
l know. l know. l know.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.106
That was a euphemism.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.442
$30,000?
There's got to be another way.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.528
He has a 60-acre beet farm
that is worth
a small fortune.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.280
Look, l will not pay.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.158
Well, l have an alternative.

"lntercourse to completion

"rendered at my discretion."

are Amber, Milky Way,

were yours to take.

l don't know why
you were in that
part of the bookstore.

Because it's next to
the baby section, okay?

You should have
said that at the beginning,

about anthropology."

l probably
shouldn't tell you this,

17:36.388 --> 17:40.058
but a lot guys
in the warehouse
work multiple jobs,

17:40.142 --> 17:41.225
so we have a place.

17:41.810 --> 17:42.810
A place?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.020
A restful location.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.606
Talk to Glen, he'll
take you up in the lift.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.483
You sleep in the warehouse?

17:49.401 --> 17:52.111
Light bulb's burned out,
so it's dark.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.032
And the heat
from the backup generator
keeps it nice and warm.

17:56.533 --> 17:59.494
Sometimes l think about it
when l'm trying to
fall asleep at home.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.998
But as far as
the rest of the office goes,
it doesn't exist. Okay?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.333
Okay.
Pam?

18:05.626 --> 18:06.793
Okay.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.420
For your signature.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.546
Okay.

18:16.470 --> 18:17.470
Phyllis?

18:19.515 --> 18:20.640
Okay, look at me.

18:22.976 --> 18:26.813
Phyllis, look at. . .
Okay, that's. . .

18:27.606 --> 18:31.109
All right, all right,
you know what?
l'm sick of this.

18:31.193 --> 18:34.112
l'm sick of the little
disapproving head shakes.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.656
lf you think
that's going to have
any effect on me,

18:36.740 --> 18:37.865
it will not.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.869
l am going to leave
right now and go to
a motel to meet Donna.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.538
Why not your condo?

18:43.747 --> 18:47.375
Because a motel is dirty,
and it is sexy.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.086
Like me and like Donna.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.673
And frankly,
the stuff that we're into
isn't very condo-appropriate.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.466
Michael, will you drop it?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.344
Everybody's spoken their mind
and no one's
changing their mind.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.139
Okay, Morgan Freeman
narrating everything.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.974
Do you want
someone to stop you?
Because no one's going to.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.268
Nobody better try to stop me.

19:07.187 --> 19:08.187
Good.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.107
l could have stopped him.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.942
(CAR LOCK BEEPlNG)

19:18.240 --> 19:19.657
Are you warmed up?
No.

19:19.783 --> 19:21.868
God, Angela,
why is that always
my responsibility?

19:24.496 --> 19:25.663
ANGELA: What did you
do to yourself?

19:25.747 --> 19:27.331
DWlGHT: Never mind.
Just. . . Never mind.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.959
ANGELA:
Well, it better work.
DWlGHT: lt'll work.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.837
Stop kissing me.
(ANGELA SCOFFlNG)

19:32.921 --> 19:34.088
lt's not in the contract.

20:12.586 --> 20:15.087
MlCHAEL: How do I feeI about
breaking up with Donna?

20:15.464 --> 20:18.591
Good. MoraI.
I feel proud.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.259
Like a grown-up.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.385
(CELL PHONE BEEPlNG)

20:21.470 --> 20:25.097
That was not easy
because I really
Iiked her a Iot.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.350
I'm a IittIe bit
emotional right now

20:27.434 --> 20:32.021
because I know
that I absolutely
made the right decision.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.316
At the end of the day,
we have to do what's right.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.860
And it was either
living with myself

20:39.655 --> 20:41.614
or being happy.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.327
And l picked

20:47.162 --> 20:48.162
the

20:50.249 --> 20:51.249
former.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.171
Michael Scott?
Yes?

20:57.839 --> 20:59.507
Do you want to make
a comment on the rumors?

20:59.591 --> 21:00.841
(SlGHlNG) Um. . .

21:02.219 --> 21:04.262
l have done some
very bad things.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.931
Things of which
l'm not proud.

21:07.182 --> 21:10.810
l would like to
publicly apologize

21:11.728 --> 21:13.312
to the coach
and the players,

21:13.939 --> 21:16.607
and l vow to never

21:17.192 --> 21:21.279
listen to
my bodily instincts
ever again.

21:22.531 --> 21:24.865
l'm talking about
the Sabre printers
that catch on fire.

21:25.033 --> 21:29.578
Oh ! Okay,
l was talking about. . .
What's going on?
