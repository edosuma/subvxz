05:19.817 --> 05:21.721
Well it ain't none of
your business who this is,

05:21.754 --> 05:23.456
but this is her husband.

05:23.488 --> 05:25.358
Well, listen, I'm about
to lose my patience too.

05:27.091 --> 05:28.560
No, I ain't got a wrong number,

05:28.593 --> 05:31.363
this has been her
number for 10 years now.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.733
Hello?

05:33.766 --> 05:36.436
God dammit!

06:03.595 --> 06:06.799

06:09.535 --> 06:13.005
Maybe I am crazy,

06:15.706 --> 06:17.709
Hey, Gale.

06:19.978 --> 06:21.814
Where are the little ones?

06:21.846 --> 06:22.781

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

That's what happens.

06:30.055 --> 06:30.889
How you been?

06:30.923 --> 06:32.158
I'm good, Sonny.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.491
Good to see you.

06:33.524 --> 06:34.459
What's going on?

06:34.492 --> 06:35.627
I've been rambling.

06:35.661 --> 06:36.795
I'll tell you that.

06:36.829 --> 06:37.997
I've got a lot of
things going on,

06:38.029 --> 06:39.697
and you know busy,
you know how it gets,

06:39.730 --> 06:40.932
it's just...

06:40.966 --> 06:42.668
This and that all over
the place, you know.

06:42.701 --> 06:44.603
You good?

06:44.636 --> 06:45.905
Yeah.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.173
Yeah, yeah.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.543
Look I ain't gonna bullshit you,

06:50.576 --> 06:52.211
I mean this may
not be news to you

06:52.244 --> 06:55.581
But Jen she ain't returning
my phone calls right now.

06:55.913 --> 06:58.550
Sonny. Come on.

06:58.884 --> 07:00.453
Listen, listen,
there's something

07:00.485 --> 07:01.653
real big coming up, okay?

07:01.687 --> 07:03.122
And it's tomorrow, all right?

07:03.154 --> 07:05.857
It's a big one.

07:06.757 --> 07:09.060
And, I got her this
card, and I just want to

07:09.093 --> 07:10.695
give it to her in person.

07:10.728 --> 07:11.830
That's all I'm asking.

07:11.863 --> 07:13.631
Sonny, we've been through this.

07:13.665 --> 07:15.034
And I appreciate
that you're her sister

07:15.067 --> 07:16.535
you're trying to
protect her, okay?

07:16.567 --> 07:17.603
I understand that,
but it don't make no

07:17.636 --> 07:19.472
sense to me that this point.

07:19.504 --> 07:21.473
We had one argument, granted.

07:22.107 --> 07:23.509
I feel like I'm
getting the block here

07:23.541 --> 07:25.243
Please, could you
keep your voice down?

07:25.276 --> 07:26.579
because I can't sleep right now,

07:26.612 --> 07:28.213
okay, I can't sleep.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.715
And I want to set
some things straight.

07:29.747 --> 07:31.983
I understand what
my position was,

07:32.016 --> 07:33.651
and it's changed.

07:33.685 --> 07:35.588
And I just want
five minutes, okay?

07:35.620 --> 07:36.688
She's going to want
to see me tomorrow,

07:36.721 --> 07:40.625
okay, I'm her husband, she's
going to want to see me.

07:40.658 --> 07:41.493
You don't understand.

07:41.526 --> 07:42.627
Tomorrow's big, okay?

07:42.661 --> 07:46.165
This is real
important to me, okay?

07:46.197 --> 07:47.866
You gotta help me
out with this, okay?

07:47.899 --> 07:49.501
I ain't go nobody else.

07:49.535 --> 07:53.639
She ain't, she ain't
responded to me.

07:54.605 --> 07:57.476
All right, Sonny. Okay?

09:54.926 --> 09:56.695
I'm gonna take a key lime pie.

09:56.727 --> 09:57.929
How is that key lime pie?

09:57.962 --> 09:58.863
It's wonderful.

09:58.897 --> 10:00.199
It's wonderful?

10:01.432 --> 10:02.967
Who wants, hey, you
want key lime pie?

10:03.999 --> 10:04.202
I'm in a good mood.

10:04.235 --> 10:05.903
I want to get, whoever
wants key lime pie,

10:05.937 --> 10:07.740
I'm gonna get you key lime pie.

10:07.773 --> 10:08.907
Honey, I'm not joking!

10:08.940 --> 10:10.843
You want some key lime pie sir?

10:10.875 --> 10:12.978
No?

10:18.450 --> 10:22.054
Ooo. Wow.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.259
That's an antique right there,

10:27.292 --> 10:28.860
that's a plantation
piece, bought it from

10:28.894 --> 10:31.797
a gentleman in Natchez.

10:32.464 --> 10:35.201
Real old.

10:35.433 --> 10:38.903
And it still looks real good.

10:39.770 --> 10:43.009
You ever give a woman
a piece of jewelry?

10:44.208 --> 10:45.743
No?

10:45.777 --> 10:47.211
Come on.

10:47.245 --> 10:50.216
Come on, you're a romantic
at heart I know you are.

10:52.350 --> 10:54.853
I gave that to my wife,

10:54.885 --> 10:56.889
on the river.

10:57.389 --> 10:59.191
I snuck up behind her,
I put it around her neck

10:59.224 --> 11:00.459
I was pretending
like I was hugging her

11:00.491 --> 11:02.760
I put it around her neck, she
didn't even know it was there.

11:02.793 --> 11:05.163
Till she got home.

11:05.197 --> 11:07.767
She looked in the mirror.

11:11.836 --> 11:14.405
It was perfect, it was like
it was meant to be there

11:14.438 --> 11:16.708
it was like it'd
always been there.

11:16.741 --> 11:19.745
The look on her face.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.984
She's gonna get
that back tomorrow,

11:26.017 --> 11:28.254
yes she is.

11:29.888 --> 11:32.858
I'm off, now let me
finish, I'm off working

11:32.890 --> 11:35.760
okay, at my job, every
day, working my ass off,

11:35.793 --> 11:39.031
excuse me,
and...

11:39.063 --> 11:41.966
that's love, everything is love,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.404
me getting up, us in being
the same bed together is love,

11:46.437 --> 11:48.005
Us having breakfast
in the morning is love,

11:48.038 --> 11:49.207
I mean, that's the way I see it.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.809
Is that not love?

11:51.842 --> 11:54.413
I don't see a problem,
that's the problem,

11:54.446 --> 11:56.981
is I don't see a problem.

12:00.885 --> 12:04.022
How gorgeous.

12:10.195 --> 12:13.032
Yeah, hey, could you put
Jen on the phone please?

12:14.466 --> 12:15.567
No this ain't a wrong number,

12:15.600 --> 12:18.003
this is the exact some
number she's had for 10 years.

12:18.035 --> 12:20.939
I spoke to Gale to... Hello?

12:28.513 --> 12:32.985
Sonny, do you
remember that night?

12:53.538 --> 12:56.207
I've said I don't think
you are having an affair,

12:56.240 --> 12:57.909
but that's exactly
what it feels like.

12:57.942 --> 13:00.011
It feels like you
are somewhere else,

13:00.044 --> 13:01.913
you are not with me.

13:01.947 --> 13:02.715
And that's what
I'm talking about.

13:02.748 --> 13:05.250
I don't feel, like
you're with me.

13:05.283 --> 13:07.452
Something is happening.

13:26.136 --> 13:28.506
I know you Sonny
and I can feel it.

13:28.539 --> 13:31.442
It feels like you have one
foot in and one foot out.

13:31.475 --> 13:33.879
It's exactly the way things
felt before we got married,

13:33.912 --> 13:35.379
it's like you're
not really there,

13:35.413 --> 13:37.883
like your head
is someplace else.

13:38.115 --> 13:39.918
Well honey,

13:39.951 --> 13:41.552
I mean where do you think
all this stuff comes from?

13:41.586 --> 13:42.988
Where do you think
the house comes from?

13:43.020 --> 13:43.889
Where do you think
your clothes come from?

13:43.922 --> 13:45.423
Where do you think
the food comes from?

13:45.456 --> 13:47.927
I gotta go to work.

13:48.493 --> 13:51.063
Brucie! You gotta a light?

13:52.898 --> 13:54.466
You owe me a dollar.

13:54.899 --> 13:56.567
Hey, you gotta get that
AC fixed in my room,

13:56.600 --> 13:58.870
it's making that crinkly
crankily noise thing

13:58.903 --> 14:01.005
and it's fucking
driving me crazy, okay?

14:01.038 --> 14:02.607
Owner's out of town,
I can take it up

14:02.640 --> 14:03.509
with him when he gets back.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.143
Just replace it,
can you replace it?

14:05.176 --> 14:06.411
I can't, that's not
how we do it here.

14:06.443 --> 14:07.478
That's bullshit.

14:07.511 --> 14:09.080
You know you, come on, Bruce.

14:09.114 --> 14:11.550
You got air cond... I
know you got some in 202.

14:11.582 --> 14:13.017
Well what if I rent 202?

14:13.051 --> 14:14.086
You ain't gonna
rent 202, there ain't

14:14.119 --> 14:15.052
nobody out there, look.

14:15.086 --> 14:16.288
Who's going to come in today?

14:16.321 --> 14:17.089
It's not like we have
extra air conditioners

14:17.121 --> 14:18.256
just laying around here.

14:18.289 --> 14:19.557
Yeah you do, come on Bruce,

14:19.591 --> 14:20.926
I know when you're
bullshitting me.

14:20.958 --> 14:21.893
I've known you long enough,

14:21.927 --> 14:22.894
I see it in your fucking face.

14:22.927 --> 14:23.961
Sonny, you are so tense,

14:23.995 --> 14:25.129
you just need to relax a little.

14:25.163 --> 14:26.097
Come on, how do you think I got

14:26.130 --> 14:27.031
where I got, right?

14:27.065 --> 14:28.033
Running my own business at 35?

14:28.066 --> 14:29.033
You know that's big?

14:29.067 --> 14:30.668
You know that's respect,
you gotta respect that.

14:30.701 --> 14:32.236
All right? And if you
want respect you gotta

14:32.269 --> 14:34.038
do the same thing
for yourself, okay?

14:34.072 --> 14:35.407
So you make that happen,
you just gotta make it happen

14:35.440 --> 14:37.309
because I gotta be on
point tomorrow, okay?

14:37.341 --> 14:38.342
I got my girl.

14:38.375 --> 14:39.543
I feel you baby.

14:39.576 --> 14:40.946
You feel me?

14:40.979 --> 14:43.115
Take a look at this.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.449
What the fuck is that?

14:44.481 --> 14:45.918
That's the best pussy in town.

14:45.951 --> 14:47.319
Bruce I ain't
interested in pussy.

14:47.351 --> 14:48.486
You ain't listening
to what I'm saying,

14:48.519 --> 14:49.954
can you listen to
what I'm sayin'?

14:49.988 --> 14:51.423
You need to just chill out,

14:51.456 --> 14:52.691
take a little time for yourself.

14:52.724 --> 14:53.792
Come on Bruce,
this ain't what I'm

14:53.825 --> 14:55.594
interested in, I need an
air conditioner, right now.

14:55.626 --> 14:56.961
Just replace it tonight.

14:56.995 --> 14:58.029
This isn't how
we do things here.

14:58.062 --> 14:59.431
If not I'm going to go
in 202 and get it myself.

14:59.464 --> 15:00.532
All right?

15:00.565 --> 15:02.935
That's a promise.

15:41.172 --> 15:44.043
<i>Gonna get me a hen now</i>

15:45.543 --> 15:48.413
<i>She won't cackle where she lays</i>

15:49.014 --> 15:52.150
Fuck! Fuck!

15:53.684 --> 15:56.454
Fuck!

16:06.130 --> 16:08.701
<i>What you want with a woman</i>

16:10.534 --> 16:14.206
<i>She won't do nothin' I say</i>

16:32.222 --> 16:35.560
Hey, how are you?

16:35.759 --> 16:38.330
Yeah, I was looking
for a girl to come over

16:38.363 --> 16:41.200
to the Southerner.

16:42.167 --> 16:45.336
Yeah, just one.

17:37.521 --> 17:40.291
wireless phone line, I think,

17:40.325 --> 17:43.161
so they get in the
building and the cook

17:43.193 --> 17:45.563
who's living upstairs, he
hears the noise he comes

17:45.596 --> 17:46.530
down to it.

17:46.564 --> 17:47.432
Where was your brother's club?

17:47.464 --> 17:48.399
In Cleveland.

17:48.432 --> 17:49.867
Okay.

17:49.901 --> 17:52.370
Okay? So the cook comes
downstairs to investigate

17:52.403 --> 17:53.771
and see that the
hell's going on,

17:53.805 --> 17:56.173
and these guys beat the
shit out of him, right?

17:56.207 --> 17:58.544
They put him on his
knees, shoot him...

18:00.811 --> 18:02.646
We call the club as soon
as the alarm is tripped.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.282
The alarm never went off.

18:04.315 --> 18:06.151
I mean I got five
properties man.

18:06.183 --> 18:10.189
Look, look, we're going
to tell you the options

18:10.387 --> 18:11.789
and what we think you need.

18:11.823 --> 18:15.160
You probably don't gotta
guard it like it's Fort Knox.

18:15.192 --> 18:16.094
All right?

18:16.127 --> 18:17.695
Let me tell you
something, what happened at

18:17.729 --> 18:20.664
your brother's club is bullshit.

18:20.698 --> 18:22.601
Every ex-con who went
to state can knock

18:22.634 --> 18:24.301
one of those off.

18:24.335 --> 18:27.139
We have a perfect
record with our clients.

18:27.172 --> 18:29.807
We don't take
anything for granted.

18:29.840 --> 18:32.577
You work with us, you
walk out of here secure.

18:35.913 --> 18:38.549
You look familiar to me,

18:38.950 --> 18:41.487
have I seen you before?

18:44.355 --> 18:46.724
You're not from
around here are you?

18:46.758 --> 18:48.360
No.

18:51.895 --> 18:53.697
You gonna tell me where?

18:53.730 --> 18:55.166
New York.

18:56.834 --> 18:59.171
Okay.

18:59.203 --> 19:02.640
Big city girl, a yankee, I see.

19:02.673 --> 19:05.510
Naw, actually, New York state.

19:06.277 --> 19:09.280
I was raised on a farm.

19:11.648 --> 19:13.350
Big fish?

19:13.384 --> 19:16.221
No, I just lived
here my whole life.

19:16.554 --> 19:18.690
I know where all the
bodies are buried.

19:18.722 --> 19:22.528
I could show you sometime
if you end up staying.

19:40.811 --> 19:42.880
Hey, you ready to have some fun?

19:42.913 --> 19:43.815
Yeah.

19:43.847 --> 19:45.216
Yeah?

19:45.250 --> 19:48.287
I'm Sugarbush. You
feeling a little frisky?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.889
What's that?

19:50.922 --> 19:52.390
You called right?

19:55.292 --> 19:57.261
Want a little bit of fucking?

19:57.295 --> 19:58.496
Then you can have
me suck your cock for

19:58.528 --> 20:01.400
a couple of minutes.

20:04.769 --> 20:07.372
So what do you got
in mind tonight?

20:07.404 --> 20:09.942
Fuck, I...

20:10.708 --> 20:13.411
What do you got?

20:13.443 --> 20:14.346
What, whoa?

20:14.378 --> 20:15.379
I'm down for anything.

20:15.413 --> 20:17.249
Is that a butt plug?

20:18.682 --> 20:20.585
I don't know about that,
it's been a while, you know?

20:20.617 --> 20:21.653
You got any cigarettes?

20:21.685 --> 20:24.222
Yeah, I got one right here.

20:33.798 --> 20:37.336
So you ready to get started?

20:38.970 --> 20:41.338
You don't look too
much like your picture.

20:41.372 --> 20:42.407
What picture?

20:42.440 --> 20:43.508
In the ad.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.300
In the ad?

20:45.347 --> 20:46.818
Yeah.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.310
That's your ad, right?

20:49.346 --> 20:50.845
Yeah, that's not me.

20:50.888 --> 20:52.419
I know, that ain't you?

20:52.458 --> 20:54.882
She's real, but you
know, she don't go out.

20:54.910 --> 20:56.759
She's just for the ads.

20:56.788 --> 20:57.828
But, you don't need that,

20:57.855 --> 20:58.990
you got this right here.

20:59.022 --> 21:00.891
So they just send
other girls out.

21:00.924 --> 21:02.493
It's kinda the luck of the draw.

21:02.527 --> 21:03.894
You know?

21:03.928 --> 21:06.398
But you hit the
jackpot tonight, baby.

21:10.867 --> 21:13.437
Hey, hold on, babe, no.

21:14.771 --> 21:16.473
No, no, no.

21:16.507 --> 21:17.375
That's not for me?

21:17.407 --> 21:19.910
No, that ain't for you.

21:19.943 --> 21:22.346
Cause I need cash, I don't
need no fake ass jewelry.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.317
Well, that ain't fake
jewelry, that's my wife's.

21:25.349 --> 21:27.451
Your wifey's.

21:27.484 --> 21:28.652
Yeah.

21:28.685 --> 21:30.989
Look, you seem like
a real nice girl,

21:31.021 --> 21:32.389
but this don't feel right.

21:32.423 --> 21:33.625
Does this feel right to you?

21:33.657 --> 21:35.092
This don't feel right?

21:35.125 --> 21:36.427
No, it don't feel right
to me right now, you know.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.063
I'm feeling a little guilty,

21:38.096 --> 21:40.065
So what you think
you're just going to stop

21:40.097 --> 21:40.964
all of a sudden?

21:40.998 --> 21:42.667
That's not how this works.

21:42.700 --> 21:43.668
That's not how this works?

21:43.701 --> 21:46.004
No, that's not how this works.

21:46.037 --> 21:48.373
Well, that is how
this works because

21:48.405 --> 21:49.973
I just don't want to go on

21:50.007 --> 21:52.376
Well there's definitely going
to be a cancellation fee.

21:52.410 --> 21:53.812
For what?

21:53.845 --> 21:54.645
I have to check and see
if I can even do that.

21:54.679 --> 21:55.447
A cancellation fee?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.948
What is that?

21:56.980 --> 22:00.018
Probably another 100 dollars.

22:00.050 --> 22:03.355
A 100 dollar
cancellation fee for what?

22:03.387 --> 22:04.788
You ain't done nothing.

22:04.821 --> 22:06.023
That's on top of what you
already owe for my time.

22:06.057 --> 22:07.491
You don't even look
like that picture.

22:07.525 --> 22:09.060
you come in, you take
off your shirt, hey man.

22:09.093 --> 22:10.260
You're going to pay me my money.

22:10.294 --> 22:12.497
-I got nothing with that
-I came all the way down here.

22:12.529 --> 22:15.466
I ain't going to pay
no cancellation fee,

22:15.799 --> 22:17.368
that's bullshit.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.569
Look you asshole,

22:18.603 --> 22:20.404
Hey, don't fucking
call me an asshole.

22:20.438 --> 22:23.675
-Fuck you man, you ask
-I've been real fucking nice

22:23.708 --> 22:26.544
You're not going no
where that's bullshit

22:26.576 --> 22:27.545
I just want this to be over

22:27.577 --> 22:30.615
It's no bullshit it's
fucking false advertsing.

22:30.647 --> 22:32.149
No it's not false advertising.

22:32.182 --> 22:33.951
I'm trying to be a
polite man right now.

22:33.984 --> 22:35.853
I'm not giving you shit,
you ain't done nothing

22:35.886 --> 22:37.588
for me, I ain't
squeezed your tittle.

22:37.622 --> 22:38.490
Give me my money!

22:38.522 --> 22:39.857
Get the fuck off me!

22:39.891 --> 22:41.926
Don't you hit me!

22:41.959 --> 22:42.861
You give me my fucking money.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.028
I'll fucking knock you out.

22:44.060 --> 22:46.096
-Gimme my money
-Fuck you! Fuck you!

22:46.130 --> 22:48.967
Get the fuck off me,
get the fuck out of here.

22:49.433 --> 22:51.403
That's bullshit.

22:51.435 --> 22:52.436
You're going to
give me my money,

22:52.470 --> 22:53.971
you'll see mother fucker.

22:54.005 --> 22:55.140
I come all the way down here,

22:55.173 --> 22:56.106
you're going to
give me my money.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.443
Giving you fucking shit.

23:15.226 --> 23:16.895
What's happening,
man? How you doing?

23:16.928 --> 23:18.062
Hey, hey, hey.

23:18.095 --> 23:19.564
I'm Big Black,
man, I'm Big Black.

23:19.596 --> 23:20.798
Good to meet you.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.066
I heard you don't want
to pay one of my girls.

23:22.098 --> 23:23.801
You got the game
fucked up, my man.

23:23.835 --> 23:25.470
Hey, listen, listen man.

23:25.502 --> 23:26.770
She come in here, she
takes off her shirt,

23:26.804 --> 23:28.473
she's talking all dirty to me,

23:28.506 --> 23:29.874
I didn't do anything,
I didn't touch her,

23:29.906 --> 23:31.576
I just wanted to call
the whole thing off.

23:31.608 --> 23:34.144
I understand my man, you
gotta pay to play though.

23:34.178 --> 23:36.514
And you've been
in here 45 minutes.

23:36.547 --> 23:38.817
You owe me 250, I'm
a reasonable guy.

23:38.849 --> 23:40.150
Hey, man, it ain't
been 45 minutes,

23:40.183 --> 23:42.119
Hey, when I'm
talkin' you listening!

23:42.153 --> 23:43.954
What I'm saying is
I didn't do anything,

23:43.988 --> 23:45.523
I didn't even get
the right girl.

23:45.556 --> 23:47.725
I didn't even get
the right girl.

23:47.758 --> 23:49.494
That's the girl, hey, hey, hey,

23:49.527 --> 23:50.862
No no, big black. Big black.

23:50.894 --> 23:52.564
I'm just lookin' at it.

23:52.596 --> 23:54.499
You want this shit back?

23:54.531 --> 23:55.466
Do you want this shit back?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.701
Yeah I want that shit back.

23:56.733 --> 23:58.535
Well it's mine now
until you pay me 250.

23:58.568 --> 24:00.504
That's bullshit
man, that's bullshit,

24:00.538 --> 24:01.172
that belongs to me!

24:01.204 --> 24:03.140
That belongs to me!

24:04.909 --> 24:05.944
Don't ever put
your mother fucking

24:05.977 --> 24:08.213
hands on me again.

24:34.204 --> 24:37.140
Do not, you want to say that?

24:37.173 --> 24:40.177
There ain't nobody else.

24:40.211 --> 24:43.014
And there could be,
there's a lot of people.

24:43.047 --> 24:45.717
There's a lot of women
that would love to be

24:45.750 --> 24:47.551
in your shoes.

24:47.585 --> 24:48.786
Is that it?

24:48.818 --> 24:50.221
Okay?

24:50.253 --> 24:51.555
Is that it, is that
what's happening here?

24:51.588 --> 24:52.656
Yeah, that's what's
happening here,

24:52.690 --> 24:53.857
yeah, that happens every day.

24:53.891 --> 24:54.759
I see.

24:54.791 --> 24:55.726
That happens every day.

24:55.759 --> 24:57.095
Okay.

24:57.127 --> 24:59.763
That I have that choice
and I choose not to,

24:59.797 --> 25:01.132
and that's the other
thing, because this

25:01.164 --> 25:02.700
is what you're trying to do.

25:02.732 --> 25:04.668
No, no, no, you're
trying to say that

25:04.701 --> 25:05.803
I don't love you anymore.

25:05.836 --> 25:07.704
That's what you're trying
to say and it's not true,

25:07.738 --> 25:08.940
I do love you.

25:08.972 --> 25:11.009
I do.

25:15.645 --> 25:18.615
Fuck!

25:18.648 --> 25:20.551
Fuck!

25:25.355 --> 25:28.692
Dammit!

25:36.634 --> 25:37.701
Can I help you with something?

25:37.734 --> 25:39.570
Who are they, Bruce?

25:39.604 --> 25:40.705
Who?

25:40.738 --> 25:42.606
Just fucking come clean, Bruce.

25:42.940 --> 25:44.107
What am I...

25:44.141 --> 25:45.209
Just tell me who
the fuck they are,

25:45.241 --> 25:46.778
and where they fuck they went?

25:46.810 --> 25:47.978
Who are you talking about?

25:48.011 --> 25:49.646
I'm talking about
Sugarbush, Bruce.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.949
Who the hell is Sugarbush?

25:50.981 --> 25:53.250
Bruce, Bruce, don't
fucking lie to me, okay?

25:53.284 --> 25:55.186
I'm your friend, you're
my friend, all right?

25:55.219 --> 25:56.721
Just tell me what you get?

25:56.753 --> 25:57.688
For what?

25:57.721 --> 25:58.655
Okay, just tell me...

25:58.689 --> 25:59.624
What's the kickback?

25:59.656 --> 26:01.058
They took my fucking necklace.

26:01.092 --> 26:03.762
Best pussy in
town, just tell me.

26:03.994 --> 26:05.729
You called?

26:05.762 --> 26:07.898
I called? I fucking called?

26:07.932 --> 26:10.300
Yeah. I fucking called.

26:10.334 --> 26:12.135
Fucking mother fucker
took my necklace,

26:12.169 --> 26:13.304
where is it?

26:13.336 --> 26:14.605
How the hell should I know?

26:14.638 --> 26:15.305
Bruce, just fucking tell me man,

26:15.338 --> 26:17.207
you're pissing me off, okay?

26:17.240 --> 26:18.609
You're pissing me off.

26:18.643 --> 26:19.344
Are you fucking
telling me that I

26:19.376 --> 26:20.711
had something to do with this?

26:20.744 --> 26:21.779
Yes, I'm telling
you that you had

26:21.813 --> 26:23.214
something to do with it,
it's a fucking setup man.

26:23.247 --> 26:24.882
How dare you accuse me
of something so stupid.

26:24.914 --> 26:26.317
You're a fucking asshole!

26:26.349 --> 26:27.217
Fuck you!

26:27.250 --> 26:28.653
Man, you're not my friend,

26:28.685 --> 26:29.620
you're fucking Judas!
-Get the fuck out of my

26:29.653 --> 26:30.855
office I'm going to
call the fucking cops

26:30.887 --> 26:33.857
-of your sorry ass.
-Suck my cock!

26:34.724 --> 26:36.093
Fucking shit.

26:36.126 --> 26:38.596
Yo, Sonny, what's going on, man?

26:38.828 --> 26:40.632
Fuck!

26:41.865 --> 26:44.669
Shit.

being tempted by women,
that is not what I'm saying.

38:15.425 --> 38:16.860
I think that is what's going on.

different position right now

38:19.730 --> 38:22.432

You ain't got no
regrets about that?

42:50.233 --> 42:51.668
you ain't gotta regret anything.

42:51.701 --> 42:53.737
You fucking stupid?

42:53.769 --> 42:55.005
Hell no I don't regret it.

42:55.038 --> 42:57.840
I sleep so good.

42:58.675 --> 43:01.711
Hey, listen, brother, I'm
going to be honest with you

43:01.744 --> 43:02.878
I came in tonight
looking for a piece

43:02.911 --> 43:05.348
and I hope you can help me out.

43:05.382 --> 43:07.184
What you need a piece for, man?

43:07.217 --> 43:08.751
Security.

43:08.784 --> 43:09.685
I feel like some people
are just out there

43:09.719 --> 43:11.121
looking for trouble.

43:11.153 --> 43:12.755
It's more than a
formality out there, man

43:12.789 --> 43:13.957
pop the cap out
there you know, man

43:13.989 --> 43:16.792
that's it, I see
it, and it's gone.

43:16.826 --> 43:19.695
Somebody step on my
manhood, shit get real.

43:19.728 --> 43:21.797
Old brazilian model
fashioned out of

43:21.831 --> 43:22.865
a higher quality America metal

43:22.898 --> 43:23.999
What's happening with you?

43:24.034 --> 43:25.202
You asking a lot of
fucking questions,

43:25.235 --> 43:26.670
any fucking way,
what's happening?

43:26.702 --> 43:28.771
Pull the trigger,
it's going to shoot.

43:28.804 --> 43:30.339
Fucking cowboy gun.

43:30.373 --> 43:32.009
They fucking with you,
they fucking with them

43:32.041 --> 43:33.376
They fucking with me, man

43:33.409 --> 43:34.644
they fucking with me.

43:34.677 --> 43:36.179
Get them on they
ass then, Sonny.

43:36.211 --> 43:38.215
That's what I'm saying.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.684
It's a question of how
hard I go in, you know?

43:40.717 --> 43:42.184
Your finger's going
to be your safety.

43:42.217 --> 43:43.653
If you don't want to
shoot, don't put your finger

43:43.686 --> 43:44.587
on the trigger.

43:44.621 --> 43:45.955
What you going
through right now,

43:45.989 --> 43:47.423
is what I went
through five years,

43:47.456 --> 43:49.292
four and a half years ago,
you know what I'm saying?

43:50.126 --> 43:51.762
You know, the banging shit I do

43:51.795 --> 43:53.230
and there's shit I do that.

43:53.262 --> 43:54.931
But at the end of the day,

43:54.963 --> 43:57.366
I got to look, nobody
else can do it for me

43:57.400 --> 44:00.704
I'm gonna look in the
mirror and I see me,

44:01.003 --> 44:04.240
now I see I real man,
you know what I'm saying?

44:04.840 --> 44:08.177
If I let that shit
slide, I'm a coward.

45:00.530 --> 45:02.800
What's up?

45:28.858 --> 45:31.294
I'm good, how are you?

45:31.327 --> 45:32.763
I'm coming home soon.

45:32.795 --> 45:35.732
Hey, hey hey!

45:36.465 --> 45:38.801
Give me the fucking necklace.

45:38.835 --> 45:39.869
Call you back.

45:39.902 --> 45:40.703
Give me the fucking necklace

45:40.737 --> 45:41.972
Give it here, bitch,
you own the zone

45:42.005 --> 45:43.974
you own the zone,
once you play it

45:44.007 --> 45:45.142
Calm down.

45:45.175 --> 45:46.977
Extortion, bitch?

45:47.010 --> 45:49.946
You sent a crew?
Where you crew now?

45:49.978 --> 45:50.946
Easy, what's the
matter with you?

45:50.980 --> 45:51.882
Where's your fucking crew?

45:51.914 --> 45:52.882
Give me the fucking necklace?

45:52.916 --> 45:53.850
That's what you want?

45:53.882 --> 45:55.151
You fucking whore!

46:00.422 --> 46:05.027
<i>He's got the whole
world in his hands</i>

46:05.427 --> 46:09.065
<i>He's got the big round
world, in his hands</i>

46:09.097 --> 46:12.902
<i>He's got the wide
world in his hands</i>

46:12.936 --> 46:16.405
<i>He's got the whole
world in his hands</i>

46:16.972 --> 46:20.442
<i>He's got the wind and
the rain in his hands</i>

46:20.476 --> 46:23.880
<i>He's got the moon
and sky in his hands</i>

46:28.418 --> 46:31.889
<i>He's got the whole
world in his hands</i>

46:45.467 --> 46:48.103
Hey, Bruce, what day is it?

46:48.137 --> 46:50.207
No, the date?

46:51.306 --> 46:53.976
You sure about that?

46:54.543 --> 46:55.978
Shit, okay...

46:56.012 --> 46:57.214
Thank you, bud.

47:35.318 --> 47:38.922
<i>He's got the whole
world in his hands</i>

47:39.155 --> 47:43.026
<i>He's got everybody, in his hands</i>

47:43.059 --> 47:46.663
<i>He's got everybody in his hands</i>

47:46.695 --> 47:51.034
<i>He's got everybody here</i>

47:51.400 --> 47:56.405
<i>Right in his hands</i>

47:59.641 --> 48:04.980
<i>He's got all the whole world</i>

48:05.014 --> 48:10.019
<i>in his hands</i>

48:35.010 --> 48:36.445
He wants me to say that he's

48:36.478 --> 48:38.614
having an affair, I don't
think you're having an affair.

48:38.648 --> 48:40.083
Cause I think I'd know.

48:40.115 --> 48:41.451
I think you'd come
home, take a shower,

48:41.483 --> 48:43.085
whatever, which he doesn't do,

48:43.119 --> 48:44.287
I don't think you'd have
time to have an affair.

48:44.320 --> 48:46.556
Have you been thinking that
I've been having an affair

48:46.588 --> 48:49.491
because I have not,
been having an affair.

48:49.525 --> 48:51.360
See he just starts yelling

48:51.393 --> 48:52.494
I have not!

48:52.527 --> 48:53.395
Sonny, you listen
to me, and don't

48:53.429 --> 48:54.396
Why would you say that!

48:54.429 --> 48:55.464
Stop yelling at me!

48:55.498 --> 48:57.032
And let me talk.

48:57.065 --> 48:59.001
I said I don't think
you are having an affair

48:59.034 --> 49:01.036
but that's exactly
what it feels like,

49:01.070 --> 49:03.006
it feels like you
are somewhere else.

49:03.039 --> 49:05.675
You expect all
this, arts, and...

49:05.708 --> 49:07.577
Honey, I just want to
feel like we're together,

49:07.610 --> 49:09.045
like we're a couple,
like we're in love.

49:09.077 --> 49:13.115
That that that,
just feels imaginary.

49:13.148 --> 49:15.050
That's not what
I'm talking about.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.385
I just want to feel
like you love me,

49:16.418 --> 49:18.387
and I don't feel like
you love me anymore,

49:18.420 --> 49:19.989
and I wish you would
just admit it so we

49:20.023 --> 49:21.758
can just move on or whatever,

49:21.791 --> 49:23.994
because I can't live
like this anymore.

49:24.027 --> 49:26.362
I feel like you don't
love me anymore, admit it,

49:26.396 --> 49:29.466
or something happening
and you're just denying it

49:29.498 --> 49:31.400
and I don't know
what to do anymore.

49:31.434 --> 49:34.004
I don't know what to do.

49:50.186 --> 49:53.557
You don't remember me.

49:54.123 --> 49:56.525
Jesus Christ.

49:57.193 --> 49:59.195
What happened to you?

50:00.630 --> 50:03.032
I want to know, is it the
object or the principle

50:03.065 --> 50:05.100
with this piece of shit.

50:05.134 --> 50:07.403
That you would put a
gun to my fucking face.

50:07.436 --> 50:08.438
That's my wife's.

50:08.471 --> 50:10.639
No, that's mine, now.

50:10.672 --> 50:12.408
Understand that?

50:12.442 --> 50:14.510
I'm going to give it
to my wife tomorrow,

50:15.777 --> 50:18.347
I'm going to give it to my wife.

50:18.380 --> 50:19.449
Your wife?

50:19.481 --> 50:21.518
Tomorrow.

50:23.251 --> 50:25.087
Your wife.

50:27.090 --> 50:29.425
Get him the fuck
out of here please.

50:29.458 --> 50:31.694
Get the fuck,

50:32.195 --> 50:33.596
I'm going to kick your ass.

50:35.697 --> 50:37.099
You ain't had enough?

50:37.132 --> 50:38.768
God dammit!

50:44.773 --> 50:47.176
Hey

50:49.378 --> 50:51.414
Wanna cigarette?

50:51.447 --> 50:53.083
Wanna cigarette?

50:53.115 --> 50:55.284
You want a fucking cigarette?

50:55.650 --> 50:57.119
Fuck you

50:57.152 --> 50:59.355
Fuck you!

51:16.739 --> 51:18.407
Sick bastard, if he
calls I'm gonna be

51:18.440 --> 51:20.442
right back over there
pissing on his face

51:20.476 --> 51:22.412
let him suck it up
like a fucking...

51:55.311 --> 51:57.447
Walk!

52:04.753 --> 52:07.556
When I was a kid I
had a pet farm goose

52:07.590 --> 52:10.393
it was my favorite
animal, I loved it.

52:11.760 --> 52:12.862
You know the difference between

52:12.894 --> 52:15.398
a farm goose and a wild goose?

52:16.231 --> 52:18.201
Geese are monogamous animals,

52:18.233 --> 52:21.237
the problem is some
male geese are sterile,

52:21.269 --> 52:22.371
so the female will go
through her whole life

52:22.405 --> 52:25.609
without ever reproducing
because she'll remain faithful.

52:26.208 --> 52:28.377
She'll still lay eggs,
still sit on the nest,

52:28.411 --> 52:30.746
incubating even though
the eggs are empty.

52:30.780 --> 52:34.184
And she'll guard and protect
those eggs with her life.

52:35.284 --> 52:37.720
But at some point
she will abandon them,

52:37.753 --> 52:40.289
it's just a matter of survival.

52:41.289 --> 52:44.661
You know what I'm saying?

52:46.262 --> 52:48.798
No, I ain't quite following ya.

52:48.831 --> 52:50.700
My dad got so sick
and tired of watching

52:50.733 --> 52:52.501
this fucking goose lay
eggs a million times

52:52.534 --> 52:54.737
that he took me outside, put
the shotgun to the goose's

52:54.769 --> 52:58.541
head and made me
pull the trigger.

52:59.307 --> 53:01.510
It was the right thing
to do at the time.

53:01.543 --> 53:02.612
Or so I thought.

53:02.644 --> 53:04.614
But now I don't know.

53:04.646 --> 53:07.750
Because if it thought
it had a purpose,

53:07.782 --> 53:10.319
what's the difference?

53:12.255 --> 53:14.923
I don't know shit about
goose, geese, pigs,

53:14.956 --> 53:16.960
farms I don't know
this shit, all right?

53:16.992 --> 53:18.027
What are you talking
about, you going around

53:18.061 --> 53:20.931
in circles here, what are
you trying to say, man?

53:21.896 --> 53:24.567
Be honest with
me, you be honest.

53:24.599 --> 53:26.302
I told you, you know
what I want and you're

53:26.335 --> 53:28.905
telling me this
story about geese.

53:28.938 --> 53:31.541
Fair enough.

53:33.943 --> 53:36.446
On me.

53:37.413 --> 53:38.715
Hey.

53:38.748 --> 53:39.715
the fuck?

53:39.748 --> 53:42.618
Mi casa su casa.

53:42.652 --> 53:44.019
Fuck, what is this?

53:44.052 --> 53:45.554
Fucking party time?

53:45.588 --> 53:46.389
Please.

53:46.422 --> 53:48.625
That shit?

53:48.990 --> 53:51.460
Aw!

53:52.027 --> 53:54.997
Good enough for you?

53:56.998 --> 53:58.800
I don't do that shit.

53:58.833 --> 54:00.703
I don't do that shit.

54:08.077 --> 54:11.314
Hey, you better chill out.

54:18.586 --> 54:20.789
Hoo!

54:21.023 --> 54:23.459
Ying yang with the
ding dang on that.

54:23.492 --> 54:25.495
That's right.

54:25.527 --> 54:27.696
That's just got a
little cap, right?

54:28.664 --> 54:31.568
Yeah, it's got a fucking cap.

54:32.068 --> 54:34.336
How do you disable an alarm?

54:34.369 --> 54:35.570
An alarm?

54:35.603 --> 54:38.407
Why you asking me this shit?

54:38.440 --> 54:40.976
What you think?

54:42.777 --> 54:44.313
You gonna give me
that necklace back?

54:44.347 --> 54:45.748
It's a start.

54:45.780 --> 54:47.382
Well baby, there's
many configurations,

54:47.416 --> 54:48.751
there's different
ways, depending.

54:48.784 --> 54:49.952
Like what?

54:49.985 --> 54:51.387
Depending on the configuration,

54:51.420 --> 54:54.057
depending on, you got,
some you got one minute

54:54.090 --> 54:56.459
you gotta call
in if you trip it.

54:56.492 --> 54:57.460
They got the phone
lines, the old ones

54:57.492 --> 54:58.894
you just snip that shit up.

54:58.927 --> 55:00.496
Or you go inside and get the box

55:00.528 --> 55:01.597
and when you open that
box you get the second one

55:01.630 --> 55:02.731
and the cut the wire in that,

55:02.764 --> 55:04.366
but you gotta cut the right one.

55:04.400 --> 55:05.902
All right? And you got the
disable codes, those are all

55:05.934 --> 55:07.402
programmed in, there's
different ones depending

55:07.436 --> 55:08.571
on the model, there's
all kind a shit.

55:08.603 --> 55:11.307
You know the codes?

55:13.943 --> 55:16.479
Listen, if I know how
something is wired,

55:16.512 --> 55:18.481
I can unwire it, all right?

55:18.514 --> 55:19.515
If I don't know
I can hypothesize,

55:19.548 --> 55:21.416
and if I can't hypothesize
I can roll the dice,

55:21.449 --> 55:23.719
but listen, ain't nobody
better than me at this.

55:23.753 --> 55:25.455
I started that business
from the ground up.

55:25.487 --> 55:27.956
I know you did, Sonny.

55:27.989 --> 55:29.024
You know I did?

55:29.057 --> 55:29.826
I do.

55:29.858 --> 55:32.761
You know I did what?

55:32.961 --> 55:34.764
What the fuck, what
the fuck is going on?

55:34.797 --> 55:35.798
What the fuck?

55:35.831 --> 55:38.034
We know all about you, Sonny.

55:38.067 --> 55:39.635
What the fuck is going on?

55:39.668 --> 55:41.403
It's a small town.

55:41.436 --> 55:43.038
I ain't helping you,
I'm not a criminal, okay?

55:43.072 --> 55:44.474
I'm not a criminal!

55:44.507 --> 55:45.340
That ain't what I do.

55:45.375 --> 55:46.342
Because you're a good boy.

55:46.376 --> 55:48.010
You want to know about
our laws, that's fine

55:48.043 --> 55:49.445
but I ain't going to be
some pisant in your army

55:49.478 --> 55:50.346
like that mother fucker,

55:50.378 --> 55:52.414
hey get that fucking
gun away from me!

55:52.447 --> 55:53.615
Sit the fuck down, man.

55:53.648 --> 55:54.916
Get that fucking
gun away from me!

55:54.949 --> 55:56.118
Who the fuck is Goldtooth, man?

55:56.152 --> 55:58.521
You're about to find out.

56:03.192 --> 56:05.427
I ain't helping you
rob no shit, all right?

56:05.460 --> 56:08.497
Fucking candy cane, candy
canes come in two colors, bitch.

56:08.530 --> 56:10.565
I want my fucking necklace.

56:10.599 --> 56:12.101
And I want your fucking help.

56:12.134 --> 56:12.802
You want my ass?

56:12.835 --> 56:14.403
What you say?

56:14.436 --> 56:15.404
I want your help!

56:15.438 --> 56:16.773
You crazy mother fucker!

56:16.806 --> 56:18.074
What are you talking about?

56:18.106 --> 56:19.007
Sit down!

56:19.041 --> 56:19.909
I want my fucking
necklace right now!

56:19.942 --> 56:20.909
Sit down!

56:20.943 --> 56:22.578
Sit down!

56:22.610 --> 56:23.545
I ain't sitting down!

56:23.579 --> 56:24.881
I'm fucking roamin'
the fucking earth, man.

56:24.914 --> 56:25.548
This is my necklace

56:25.581 --> 56:26.516
it's on my neck!

56:26.548 --> 56:27.617
Peace mother fucker!

56:27.650 --> 56:30.420
God damn I'm on an elevator up!

56:30.452 --> 56:31.686
Sit your ass down

56:31.719 --> 56:33.021
Sit your ass down

56:33.054 --> 56:34.556
Sit your ass down

56:45.166 --> 56:47.670
Hey!

56:47.702 --> 56:49.739
Hey!

56:53.842 --> 56:56.878
Help me! Help me please!

56:56.911 --> 57:00.582
<i>Find my love</i>

57:01.617 --> 57:06.623
<i>And he never spared among the...</i>

57:08.490 --> 57:09.891
This is going to seem so small,

57:09.925 --> 57:12.595
it's almost embarrassing but,

57:12.628 --> 57:15.698
okay, so Sonny and I
were invited to this

57:15.898 --> 57:18.233
big gala event at this
mansion, it was like this big

57:18.266 --> 57:19.768
party for the
symphony, or whatever,

57:19.802 --> 57:23.639
and we decided to go
and we got all dressed up

57:23.672 --> 57:26.041
and Sonny's wearing a suit
and I'm wearing a dress

57:26.074 --> 57:28.477
and I looked pretty
good and stuff

57:28.510 --> 57:31.246
so we're hanging
out at this party

57:31.280 --> 57:36.285
and at one point in the
night he looked over at me

57:40.155 --> 57:41.990
and just, the way
he looked at me,

57:42.023 --> 57:44.559
I could see that he
loved me, you know,

57:44.592 --> 57:48.630
just that look in his
eye, like he loved me.

57:51.934 --> 57:54.704
That's the last time I feel
like he looked at me like that

57:54.737 --> 57:57.539
and it was like a year
ago, like over a year ago,

57:57.572 --> 58:00.576
like 15 months ago.

58:02.878 --> 58:06.548
Sonny, do you
remember that night?

58:07.849 --> 58:11.554
Yeah, I remember it, yeah, yeah.

58:22.998 --> 58:26.601
Where the fuck do you
think you're going?

58:35.043 --> 58:36.578
Finish him.

58:36.612 --> 58:38.146
No, no, no!

58:38.179 --> 58:40.782
I said I'd do it, I'm good.

58:40.983 --> 58:43.786
Stop it, I'm good, I'll do it!

58:47.922 --> 58:52.060
Chill out, we'll be
there in a little while.

58:59.034 --> 59:01.971
Aw man

59:02.271 --> 59:03.639
Chill the fuck out, man,

59:03.672 --> 59:05.708
makes it easier on both of us.

59:07.108 --> 59:07.943
Why you got my head down, man?

59:07.976 --> 59:09.110
Where we going?

59:09.143 --> 59:10.178
Cause you don't
need to fucking know

59:10.211 --> 59:12.715
until we get there, you'll
find out soon enough.

59:14.349 --> 59:17.686
I think we'll be fine, we
just need to drink more.

59:22.824 --> 59:25.627
Hon, I just don't think
that counselor woman is doing

59:26.628 --> 59:29.230
us any favors, I just don't
want to see her anymore.

59:29.264 --> 59:32.367
Every time we go
we get in a fight,

59:32.400 --> 59:35.337
end up trying to
think of things to say.

59:36.237 --> 59:38.173
I think it helps, I
think we need to have

59:38.206 --> 59:41.577
someone that we can talk to.

59:42.110 --> 59:44.212
I mean,

59:45.280 --> 59:47.617
I just want us to be happy.

59:47.650 --> 59:49.785
I do to, I do to, I
want us to be happy too.

59:49.818 --> 59:51.653
We are happy.

59:51.686 --> 59:54.222
Look at everything we've got.

59:54.255 --> 59:57.326
We have so much more
than most people.

01:00:12.907 --> 01:00:14.175
What?

01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:15.143
Nothing.

01:00:15.177 --> 01:00:16.045
What?

01:00:16.077 --> 01:00:17.346
Want another drink?

01:00:17.378 --> 01:00:19.781
Yeah, I do.

01:01:04.793 --> 01:01:05.961
Hey.

01:01:07.195 --> 01:01:09.364
Where's my drink?

01:01:10.898 --> 01:01:13.335
What is that?

01:01:15.036 --> 01:01:16.805
What is that?

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:18.273
That's a number of

01:01:18.306 --> 01:01:19.442
Who is that?

01:01:19.474 --> 01:01:21.043
That's Franki,
she came in today.

01:01:21.076 --> 01:01:23.778
And who is she?

01:01:23.811 --> 01:01:28.784
She's from New York and she...

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.387
Why do you have her number?

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.289
Because she's a
client and she wants me

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.990
to show her around.

01:01:35.023 --> 01:01:37.393
But I can get Nick, I
can get Nick to do it,

01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:40.128
it's no big deal.

01:01:42.898 --> 01:01:45.901
You have been lying
to me every time

01:01:45.934 --> 01:01:49.839
I've asked you if something's
going on and you've said no.

01:01:49.871 --> 01:01:53.174
You've been lying
to me all this time.

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.876
And you've been
making me seem like

01:01:54.909 --> 01:01:56.811
I'm a crazy person.

01:01:56.844 --> 01:01:58.780
And you have this fucking number

01:01:58.813 --> 01:02:01.382
in your fucking pocket
the whole time we

01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:03.853
were in therapy, and
you're acting like I'm

01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:06.788
a crazy person, who
the fuck is that person?

01:02:06.822 --> 01:02:10.291
That is, that's a
woman who came in today

01:02:10.324 --> 01:02:12.327
that has nothing to do, honey.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.797
You just lie to me,
you just lie and lie.

01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:16.065
I've not been lying
to you all this time.

01:02:16.097 --> 01:02:18.233
Look at that number,
that is a girl's number!

01:02:18.266 --> 01:02:21.469
It is in red little
loopy letters.

01:02:21.503 --> 01:02:24.807
Yeah, because she, she just
wants me to show her around,

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:26.909
honey, I don't have to
do it I'll call Nick.

01:02:26.942 --> 01:02:30.480
Listen, do you want me
to call Nick right now?

01:02:32.014 --> 01:02:35.184
Great, okay.

01:02:35.416 --> 01:02:37.519
Hon, you just broke that.

01:02:37.552 --> 01:02:38.853
What the fuck?

01:02:38.887 --> 01:02:41.190
And you're going

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:44.092
this is every day,
I have tons of these

01:02:44.126 --> 01:02:47.530
this was given to me
today, that is a client.

01:02:48.429 --> 01:02:50.932
Yeah, just drink
up your alcohol.

01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:51.768
Fucking bitch.

01:02:56.070 --> 01:02:57.972
Well you're accusing me.

01:02:58.005 --> 01:03:01.277
Scumbag mother fucker

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:04.012
You're a moron.

01:03:04.045 --> 01:03:05.814
I was sitting there
in therapy with you

01:03:05.847 --> 01:03:06.981
Yeah, yeah,

01:03:07.014 --> 01:03:08.317
You talking about me being crazy

01:03:08.349 --> 01:03:09.918
Yeah, because you are crazy

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:11.854
I'm going to call
Nick right now,

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:13.989
and he'll tell you
that she came in,

01:03:14.021 --> 01:03:16.558
that she's a client.

01:03:18.327 --> 01:03:21.430
Do you want me to call him?

01:03:27.869 --> 01:03:29.237
I'm calling Nick right now.

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:31.106
I'm calling Nick right now.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:33.976
I want you to hear this.

01:03:34.876 --> 01:03:36.545
Nick, it's Sonny.

01:03:36.577 --> 01:03:38.880
Having a huge fight
because Jen found the

01:03:38.914 --> 01:03:41.050
number of Franki that came in,

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:43.318
please call us back
to tell Jen that

01:03:43.351 --> 01:03:44.953
she's fucking crazy.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:46.288
Thank you, bye.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:49.625
God damn you, god damn you!

01:03:49.657 --> 01:03:51.025
Everything's okay!

01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:51.894
Get the fuck out of the way.

01:03:51.927 --> 01:03:53.295
It's okay.

01:03:53.327 --> 01:03:54.496
I've not been doing
anything with other women.

01:03:54.528 --> 01:03:57.934
I'm getting out of
here, get out of my way.

01:04:00.235 --> 01:04:04.006
Wait!

01:05:25.019 --> 01:05:27.355
Look up.

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:31.626
-No, it's my father-in-law's
place, he knows me

01:05:31.659 --> 01:05:33.061
Yeah, mother fucker,
you're going in there.

01:05:33.094 --> 01:05:34.529
I ain't doin' this one.

01:05:34.563 --> 01:05:35.664
Yeah, we're going
in, you don't have a

01:05:35.697 --> 01:05:37.099
fucking choice.

01:05:37.132 --> 01:05:38.133
I ain't doing this one.

01:05:38.166 --> 01:05:39.268
Shut up! Shut up!

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.201
Listen, listen,
listen, look at me.

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:41.603
Look, look look, baby, baby,

01:05:41.635 --> 01:05:43.538
ten minutes, ten
minutes, ten minutes

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:44.673
I'm not going to do it.

01:05:44.706 --> 01:05:46.141
Look at me, look look,

01:05:46.173 --> 01:05:47.376
ten minutes.

01:05:47.409 --> 01:05:49.044
You'll get your chain,

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:51.046
you'll go back to your wife,
everything's back to normal.

01:05:51.079 --> 01:05:52.648
-That's my
father-in-law's house.

01:05:52.681 --> 01:05:53.983
Fuck.

01:05:54.016 --> 01:05:55.550
You've gotta fucking do it.

01:05:55.784 --> 01:05:56.585
Fucking junkie.

01:05:56.617 --> 01:05:58.586
Shut up!

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.422
Okay.

01:06:03.190 --> 01:06:04.726
You gotta wear this.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.028
Put it on, don't take it off.

01:06:07.262 --> 01:06:09.097
You just have to get us
in the house, that's it.

01:06:09.130 --> 01:06:10.098
It's very important.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.032
You won't hurt him?

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:12.233
I ain't going to
fucking hurt anybody.

01:06:12.266 --> 01:06:14.002
Just...

01:06:14.202 --> 01:06:15.137
Okay.

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:17.539
Put it on, keep it
on, don't say a word.

01:06:17.572 --> 01:06:18.474
All right?

01:06:18.507 --> 01:06:20.976
You say anything, you're dead.

01:06:30.818 --> 01:06:34.123
I gotta cut this,
I gotta cut this.

01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:38.126
Okay?

01:06:38.159 --> 01:06:41.396
Now listen, once I snip this,

01:06:41.429 --> 01:06:44.766
we have 60 seconds to
get to the one inside.

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:47.402
60 seconds, all right?

01:06:51.139 --> 01:06:53.442
You ready?

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.148
That's the power.

01:07:34.181 --> 01:07:35.083
That's the power, if
we cut that they're

01:07:35.117 --> 01:07:36.251
going to know something's up.

01:07:36.284 --> 01:07:38.119
We're good. Don't hurt him

01:07:38.152 --> 01:07:39.387
you told me you're not
going to hurt him, right?

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:53.568
The room's over here.

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:25.466
It's me, it's Sonny,
I need to see Jen.

01:08:25.832 --> 01:08:26.835
What the fuck?

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:28.170
Get him out of here!

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:30.171
What are you doing?

01:08:31.538 --> 01:08:33.140
I'm trying to get the necklace,

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.274
I'm trying to get Jen back

01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:35.210
What are you fucking
talking about?

01:08:35.243 --> 01:08:37.511
I'm going to give
it to her tomorrow.

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.452
Jen!

01:08:43.716 --> 01:08:45.185
Jen!

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:49.792
She's dead, she's fucking gone!

01:08:59.634 --> 01:09:03.337
You remember that night?

01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:27.229
Get out of my way.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:50.551
Fuck off.

01:10:12.873 --> 01:10:16.344
Wait. No wait.

01:14:15.182 --> 01:14:18.020
Hello, is Jen there?

01:14:18.252 --> 01:14:20.588
Jen?

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:24.493
Yeah, could you put
Jen on the phone please?

01:14:26.293 --> 01:14:28.796
This is her husband
Sonny, who's this?

01:14:30.931 --> 01:14:32.533
No this ain't a wrong number,

01:14:32.567 --> 01:14:35.136
this is the exact same
number she's had for 10 years.

01:14:42.176 --> 01:14:45.914
Well I'm getting a
little impatient too.

01:14:45.947 --> 01:14:48.650
Hello?

01:14:57.859 --> 01:14:59.528
Jen?

01:15:17.811 --> 01:15:18.880
What you got for me today?

01:15:18.912 --> 01:15:20.881
Whatcha doin'?

01:15:20.914 --> 01:15:23.952
Just looking for a hit.

01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:25.753
What you got?

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.756
I got five dollars, right here.

01:15:27.788 --> 01:15:29.957
Shit that ain't enough

01:15:30.224 --> 01:15:31.592
Come on

01:15:31.626 --> 01:15:33.094
