03:10.480 --> 03:12.439
Yeah, you can just walk out.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.651
We've got zero visibility.

03:15.652 --> 03:18.570
That's right. Straight ahead.

03:18.571 --> 03:21.698
Don't stop...

03:21.699 --> 03:26.699
- Come on.
- Get ready. Go.

03:27.955 --> 03:31.249
I got it here. Give me a hand,
fellas. Grab that.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.501
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:32.502 --> 03:36.755
What happened?

03:36.756 --> 03:39.257
Soon as I saw them,
I knew they were unusual.

03:39.258 --> 03:42.094
- How so?
- Well, facial similarities...

03:42.095 --> 03:44.971
...skeletal and muscle structure.

03:44.972 --> 03:48.225
It's in the report. One of them
woke up, killed two men.

03:48.226 --> 03:51.269
Would have killed more.
We hit him with a tranquilizer.

03:51.270 --> 03:53.605
Same kind of gun we use
on polar bears.

03:53.606 --> 03:56.983
For security reasons,
I thought it best to stash them here...

03:56.984 --> 03:59.820
...until we can find out
who or what they are.

03:59.821 --> 04:01.947
These two we've kept sedated.

04:01.948 --> 04:04.950
That's the killer one down there.

04:04.951 --> 04:09.951
If it were up to me,
I'd keep him sedated permanently.

04:10.123 --> 04:12.290
I need to examine them.

04:12.291 --> 04:15.836
All of them?

04:15.837 --> 04:20.837
Absolutely.

04:21.466 --> 04:24.052
Hey, he got clobbered by our guys
pretty good.

04:24.053 --> 04:27.139
See any signs of bruising?

04:27.140 --> 04:28.849
No.

04:28.850 --> 04:33.850
That's significant.

04:59.005 --> 05:01.798
I'm a medical doctor.

05:01.799 --> 05:06.799
I'm only concerned with your health.

05:14.854 --> 05:19.854
If these guys hit New York,
no one's gonna care about Cuba.

05:19.859 --> 05:24.859
Their passports
are high-quality forgeries.

05:25.072 --> 05:28.617
Antidote for the sedative,
widely available.

05:28.618 --> 05:33.618
Swiss Army, nonmilitary survival gear
and weapons.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.124
Oh, yeah.

05:36.125 --> 05:39.169
A tourist map to New York City.

05:39.170 --> 05:42.881
Maybe they're covert agents
on a secret mission.

05:42.882 --> 05:46.676
- Thank you.
- Maybe they're American military trainees.

05:46.677 --> 05:51.677
Or maybe they're aliens
come to conquer the planet.

05:53.684 --> 05:58.684
For me, what's most important right now
is figuring out what they are.

06:01.359 --> 06:04.778
Who knows about them?

06:04.779 --> 06:07.739
Everyone's so concerned
about atomic bombs going off.

06:07.740 --> 06:10.200
Nobody cares
about some weird guys I found.

06:10.201 --> 06:14.496
You didn't answer my question.

06:14.497 --> 06:18.875
Nobody outside of this compound
has the details.

06:18.876 --> 06:20.126
That's dangerous.

06:20.127 --> 06:21.503
It's all dangerous.

06:21.504 --> 06:24.214
Who knows
what the Soviets are up to?

06:24.215 --> 06:29.215
Those are not normal human beings.

06:30.555 --> 06:35.016
- Juliet, you know why I brought you here.
- To verify what you already know.

06:35.017 --> 06:36.685
I want proof...

06:36.686 --> 06:41.686
...so you can help me make the right
decision about who to report this to.

06:42.191 --> 06:47.191
Give me 24 hours.

08:09.862 --> 08:12.364
<i>--Soviet technicians at the sites.</i>

08:12.365 --> 08:16.159
<i>The hazards to all concerned
of continuing this threat...</i>

08:16.160 --> 08:17.702
. <i>.</i> . <i>will be recognized.</i>

08:17.703 --> 08:21.873
<i>Third,
it shall be the policy of this nation...</i>

08:21.874 --> 08:25.126
<i>...to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba...</i>

08:25.127 --> 08:28.213
<i>...against any nation
in the Western Hemisphere...</i>

08:28.214 --> 08:32.509
<i>...as an attack by the Soviet Union
on the United States...</i>

08:32.510 --> 08:37.510
<i>...requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union.</i>

08:37.556 --> 08:41.601
<i>Fourth,
as a necessary military precaution...</i>

08:41.602 --> 08:46.022
<i>...I have reinforced our base
at Guantanamo, evacuated today...</i>

08:46.023 --> 08:48.400
<i>...the dependents
of our personnel there...</i>

08:48.401 --> 08:49.651
What is it, boy?

08:49.652 --> 08:54.652
<i>...and ordered additional military units
to be on standby alert.</i>

09:13.050 --> 09:15.802
Get inside! Watch out now--!

09:15.803 --> 09:20.803
Get behind one!

09:22.059 --> 09:24.227
Punch him out! Punch him--!

09:24.228 --> 09:29.228
Go get him!

09:31.110 --> 09:36.110
Hey, hey, he)”

09:50.129 --> 09:53.048
<i>--months in which many threats
and denunciations...</i>

09:53.049 --> 09:55.467
<i>...will keep us aware of our dangers.</i>

09:55.468 --> 10:00.468
<i>But the greatest danger of all
would be to do nothing.</i>

10:01.515 --> 10:04.768
<i>--path we have chosen for the present
is full of hazards...</i>

10:04.769 --> 10:06.603
<i>...as all paths are.</i>

10:06.604 --> 10:09.230
<i>But it is the one most consistent...</i>

10:09.231 --> 10:12.067
<i>...with our character and courage
as a nation...</i>

10:12.068 --> 10:14.736
...and <i>our commitments
around the world.</i>

10:14.737 --> 10:17.530
<i>The cost of freedom is always high.</i>

10:17.531 --> 10:20.325
<i>But Americans have always paid it.</i>

10:20.326 --> 10:22.994
<i>- And one path we shall never choose...</i>
- Hey.

10:22.995 --> 10:27.165
<i>-...the path of surrender or submission.
- Close the</i> damn <i>door.</i>

10:27.166 --> 10:32.166
<i>Our goal is not the victory of might,
but the vindication of right.</i>

10:36.008 --> 10:38.301
<i>--here in this hemisphere...</i>

10:38.302 --> 10:40.762
<i>...and we hope around the world.</i>

10:40.763 --> 10:44.224
<i>God willing,
that goal will be achieved.</i>

10:44.225 --> 10:49.225
<i>Thank you and good night.</i>

11:46.954 --> 11:49.873
Hell of a place to die.

11:49.874 --> 11:52.000
We do this right, sergeant...

11:52.001 --> 11:57.001
...we have contracts up the yin-yang
for years.

12:05.806 --> 12:10.143
Let's go to work.

12:10.144 --> 12:13.313
Miss Frazer, this is Sergeant Gibbs.

12:13.314 --> 12:14.606
Ma'am.

12:14.607 --> 12:18.568
Colonel Desmond Trump,
Con 7 Securities.

12:18.569 --> 12:20.069
Welcome to Northgate.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.156
I see you've made progress
in getting set up, colonel.

12:23.157 --> 12:26.951
We try to do our best.

12:26.952 --> 12:30.538
I also see you've made sure
no IV Oil logos are on any equipment.

12:30.539 --> 12:32.582
Yeah. As per your orders.

12:32.583 --> 12:35.335
Good starts are important, colonel.

12:35.336 --> 12:40.336
- Let's go meet our benefactor.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:46.513 --> 12:48.139
What's our standpoint?

12:48.140 --> 12:49.641
Yeah, are we good?

12:49.642 --> 12:50.892
How many left?

12:50.893 --> 12:53.978
- It went the other way.
- All right.

12:53.979 --> 12:58.979
Miss Jane Frazer,
director of R&D for IV Industries...

12:58.984 --> 13:02.737
...let me introduce you
to Dr. Andrew Malraux...

13:02.738 --> 13:06.783
...and his associate, Vladimir Lobokoff.

13:06.784 --> 13:11.784
-It's a pleasure to meet you, Dr. Malraux.
- No. I'm Dr. Malraux.

13:12.373 --> 13:16.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
My report said you're almost 50.

13:16.001 --> 13:18.753
Lobokoff. He gets this all the time.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.339
And don't think about
playing him racquetball.

13:21.340 --> 13:26.340
Plays like a teenager. Also ace mechanic.
We were in Siberia on expedition--

13:26.345 --> 13:30.473
That's all very interesting, Dr. Lobokoff,
but as to our business at hand?

13:30.474 --> 13:35.186
I'm about to start a presentation to team
leaders on the history of our search.

13:35.187 --> 13:40.187
Well, I'll be candid with you, Malraux,
just so we all know where we stand.

13:40.651 --> 13:44.112
I couldn't give a damn
about your research.

13:44.113 --> 13:47.865
You see those test rigs there?
They'll verify whether there's oil.

13:47.866 --> 13:52.328
We can turn politicians loose on natives
and environmentalists for the rights.

13:52.329 --> 13:57.125
That's why we're freezing our asses off
out here in this wasteland.

13:57.126 --> 13:59.002
Oh, God, that's awful.

13:59.003 --> 14:01.546
Well, you can pretend.

14:01.547 --> 14:04.590
- Excuse me?
- You can pretend to be interested.

14:04.591 --> 14:08.594
You see, Miss Frazer,
we're all compromising to be here.

14:08.595 --> 14:10.722
Colonel Trump falsified documents...

14:10.723 --> 14:14.434
...so he could get men and equipment
from his Army connections...

14:14.435 --> 14:19.230
...past Canadian customs
in order to impress his new boss.

14:19.231 --> 14:22.608
Over a drink, ask Dr. Lobokoff
how he managed to download...

14:22.609 --> 14:25.778
...top-secret Russian files
onto my hard drive.

14:25.779 --> 14:29.574
Or me. How I compromised
my moral and ethic duty...

14:29.575 --> 14:32.577
...as a doctor,
covering for an illegal oil operation.

14:32.578 --> 14:36.664
So the least you can do, Miss Frazer,
is pretend to care.

14:36.665 --> 14:39.751
Necessity for your compromises
is obvious. Where's mine?

14:39.752 --> 14:41.836
If the leader doesn't give a shit...

14:41.837 --> 14:44.505
...people may not be as diligent
as they should.

14:44.506 --> 14:46.299
And my project, cover or not...

14:46.300 --> 14:48.968
...is still being pursued
where death may occur.

14:48.969 --> 14:52.388
Deaths, Miss Frazer,
bring unwanted attention.

14:52.389 --> 14:56.267
And anyone on any expedition knows
not to drink the lounge coffee.

14:56.268 --> 14:59.520
You may wanna try some vodka
with that.

14:59.521 --> 15:04.521
Hey-

15:08.530 --> 15:11.991
It's tolerable.

15:11.992 --> 15:15.787
Dr. Andrew Malraux,
though IV Oil considers your project...

15:15.788 --> 15:19.540
...a convenient cover,
I am fascinated by historical research...

15:19.541 --> 15:22.585
...and I look forward
to your exciting presentation.

15:22.586 --> 15:25.505
Thank you.

15:25.506 --> 15:27.965
Dr. Ditmos Stempky.

15:27.966 --> 15:31.469
In the early '40s, Stempky was doing
genetic work for the Nazis.

15:31.470 --> 15:35.098
Decades ahead of its time.
End of the war, the Russians got him...

15:35.099 --> 15:38.810
...and he disappeared
off the face of the earth.

15:38.811 --> 15:41.145
1958, Varamutska.

15:41.146 --> 15:43.314
A small Siberian village.

15:43.315 --> 15:47.568
Three young men attached to a secret
Soviet science project run by Stempky...

15:47.569 --> 15:51.197
...cut the town's power,
assassinated leaders, assaulted police...

15:51.198 --> 15:55.660
...raped women, destroyed the town.
They disappeared and two days later...

15:55.661 --> 15:59.372
...were found in Stempky's
laboratory awaiting further instructions.

15:59.373 --> 16:03.000
The experiment
was deemed a success.

16:03.001 --> 16:05.545
1962.

16:05.546 --> 16:08.840
A civilian plane crashed
about 70 miles southeast of here...

16:08.841 --> 16:10.675
...killing the pilot instantly.

16:10.676 --> 16:13.344
However,
three survivors deemed unusual...

16:13.345 --> 16:17.265
...were transferred here to Northgate.

16:17.266 --> 16:20.059
Government scientists
were brought in to verify...

16:20.060 --> 16:25.060
...if these survivors were Stempky's
genetically modified soldiers.

16:25.691 --> 16:28.901
Unfortunately, before any information
could be gathered...

16:28.902 --> 16:33.531
...the survivors broke free from their cells,
massacred 25 of the base's staff...

16:33.532 --> 16:38.453
...and disappeared into the tundra,
never to be seen or heard from again.

16:38.454 --> 16:41.247
These are autopsy photographs
of the pilot.

16:41.248 --> 16:44.959
The tattoo we discovered had words
from an old Russian dialect.

16:44.960 --> 16:49.881
Dr. Lobokoff was able to trace the tattoo
back to a secret Russian commando unit.

16:49.882 --> 16:51.799
Unit's leaders were extremists...

16:51.800 --> 16:55.470
...with one purpose in mind:
prove their superiority over the West.

16:55.471 --> 16:58.055
Unbeknownst to Khrushchev
and his government...

16:58.056 --> 17:01.392
...these extremists
had put a plan into action.

17:01.393 --> 17:04.436
The survivors
were highly-trained Russian soldiers...

17:04.438 --> 17:08.065
...with a mission to launch an attack
on New York City...

17:08.066 --> 17:11.611
...during the height
of Cuban missile crisis in 1962.

17:11.612 --> 17:15.071
Imagine, if you will,
the consequence of such an act.

17:15.073 --> 17:19.618
It's imperative I find these three soldiers,
extract DNA...

17:19.619 --> 17:22.038
...and verify once and for all...

17:22.039 --> 17:27.039
...whether or not Stempky had indeed
genetically modified human beings.

17:33.675 --> 17:38.675
Thank you.

18:24.476 --> 18:26.185
Miss Frazer.

18:26.186 --> 18:29.730
I heard the music. Working late?

18:29.731 --> 18:31.691
- Couldn't sleep.
- Yeah, me neither.

18:31.692 --> 18:33.985
It's the sunless twilight.

18:33.986 --> 18:37.488
Anything interesting?

18:37.489 --> 18:38.990
Not really.

18:38.991 --> 18:41.826
Try me.
Your presentation was more interesting...

18:41.827 --> 18:46.080
...than sediment sample reports
and Trump's war stories.

18:46.081 --> 18:48.833
Are you flirting with me?

18:48.834 --> 18:53.504
I thought that was obvious.

18:53.505 --> 18:58.505
I've been creating computer models
of routes the soldiers may have taken.

18:59.177 --> 19:02.722
The science team, they were all killed?

19:02.723 --> 19:05.641
I was paying attention
to your presentation.

19:05.642 --> 19:08.269
All but one.

19:08.270 --> 19:12.982
Miss Frazer, you wanna look
at something else?

19:12.983 --> 19:17.983
- I've got some KGB files here.
- The file that interests me is yours.

19:19.698 --> 19:23.868
Deceased parents, no siblings,
never married, no kids.

19:23.869 --> 19:26.037
You find that interesting?

19:26.038 --> 19:28.205
Yes.

19:28.206 --> 19:33.044
Advanced degrees in biology,
mathematics, archeology.

19:33.045 --> 19:35.463
Fluent in French,
German and Russian.

19:35.464 --> 19:40.009
Have an uncanny way
of getting into tough places.

19:40.010 --> 19:42.136
I have a sense for people, Andrew.

19:42.137 --> 19:45.473
There's more here
than digging up history.

19:45.474 --> 19:49.101
That's very melodramatic of you,
Miss Frazer.

19:49.102 --> 19:51.479
You know what they say
about scientists.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.566
What do they say about scientists?

19:55.567 --> 19:58.736
I'll save that for another night.

19:58.737 --> 20:02.657
Maybe when we get to know each other
better, you'll share it with me.

20:02.658 --> 20:06.702
I can be a valuable asset.

20:06.703 --> 20:09.747
I'm a believer that appearances
can be quite deceptive.

20:09.748 --> 20:12.792
Precisely.
Said the man who put IV Oil...

20:12.793 --> 20:17.793
...into a place they've been trying
to buy into for decades.

20:34.815 --> 20:37.775
- Come on, bring it up.
- Yeah.

20:37.776 --> 20:40.778
- Steve, you wanna watch it for me?
- Sure.

20:40.779 --> 20:43.197
What did I tell you, professor?

20:43.198 --> 20:45.157
Eleven o'clock, right on the nose.

20:45.158 --> 20:50.158
Yes, colonel.

20:58.839 --> 21:01.465
- Let's do it.
- Start with this.

21:01.466 --> 21:04.176
Yeah.

21:04.177 --> 21:09.177
- Spectacular entrance, Miss Frazer.
- Thank you, colonel.

21:09.182 --> 21:12.059
I'm showing an interest, am I not'?

21:12.060 --> 21:13.477
Every little bit helps.

21:13.478 --> 21:18.478
I'll take that as a yes.
I hope you find what you're looking for.

21:18.859 --> 21:21.318
You mean my genetic soldiers.

21:21.319 --> 21:22.570
That too.

21:22.571 --> 21:24.029
Listen up.

21:24.030 --> 21:27.158
I wanna keep this short and sweet.

21:27.159 --> 21:31.036
You know where we're gonna be
searching, so keep your wits about you.

21:31.037 --> 21:33.247
This weather can change
at any second.

21:33.248 --> 21:36.876
You get lazy, you'll get dead.

21:36.877 --> 21:39.920
Now, check and double-check
your equipment.

21:39.921 --> 21:41.505
- They're yours.
- Yes, sir.

21:41.506 --> 21:46.506
You heard what the man said.
Check and double-check. Move out!

22:13.371 --> 22:18.371
Sergeant, speed it up.
Don't let him get too far ahead.

22:43.527 --> 22:48.527
- Let's bring it up.
- Just give me a minute.

22:49.908 --> 22:51.575
Gonna rest here.

22:51.576 --> 22:56.205
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

22:56.206 --> 22:59.291
Last time I was here,
it was just a wall of ice.

22:59.292 --> 23:04.292
Though I'm certain
they came through here.

23:10.303 --> 23:13.514
How far you think they got?

23:13.515 --> 23:15.808
Not far.

23:15.809 --> 23:19.144
They're up there.

23:19.145 --> 23:21.605
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

23:21.606 --> 23:24.316
Make camp here.

23:24.317 --> 23:27.069
You heard the man.
Black 88, Car 7, let's go!

23:27.070 --> 23:28.612
- Move it! Move it!
- Got it.

23:28.613 --> 23:30.948
Yes, sir.

23:30.949 --> 23:33.284
Jesus.

23:33.285 --> 23:34.660
Son of a bitch.

23:34.661 --> 23:38.747
Look at him go.

23:38.748 --> 23:41.250
The doc says his boys did this
in a blizzard.

23:41.251 --> 23:43.627
Really?

23:43.628 --> 23:46.463
Well, if they did,
they're goddamned supermen, huh?

23:46.464 --> 23:49.091
Yeah, tell me about it.

23:49.092 --> 23:53.304
Son of a bitch.

23:53.305 --> 23:55.639
He don't look like he ever get tired,
huh?

23:55.640 --> 23:58.434
Not from what they tell me.

23:58.435 --> 24:00.644
At this rate, he's gonna be up there...

24:00.645 --> 24:03.647
...find his piles of bones,
bring them to base camp...

24:03.648 --> 24:07.192
...and wanna go home
before she punches a hole in the ground.

24:07.193 --> 24:12.193
- And she's gonna blame me.
-Oh, you know it.

24:44.481 --> 24:49.026
That son of a bitch is waving at us.

24:49.027 --> 24:54.027
Why wave back?

25:03.208 --> 25:07.962
I got it.

25:07.963 --> 25:10.339
It's supposed to break tomorrow?

25:10.340 --> 25:13.467
Yeah. Put it on the manifest.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.720
It's all right. You got it.

25:16.721 --> 25:21.225
Come on in.

25:21.226 --> 25:23.394
Son of a bitch, man. Aren't you cold?

25:23.395 --> 25:25.354
Not really.

25:25.355 --> 25:26.814
What can I do for you?

25:26.815 --> 25:31.402
- I'd like to look at the daily reports.
- I just finished it up. Have a look.

25:31.403 --> 25:35.322
We've done all right.
We've got base camp established.

25:35.323 --> 25:38.659
Lines of communication and supply
with Northgate.

25:38.660 --> 25:40.411
We're running a grid search.

25:40.412 --> 25:44.206
I'd say to the untrained eye,
we look like a legitimate operation.

25:44.207 --> 25:49.207
It is a legitimate operation.

25:49.504 --> 25:53.340
Well, as long as my people
and equipment aren't put in jeopardy...

25:53.341 --> 25:58.341
...I'm a happy Camper-

26:35.467 --> 26:40.467
Caribou bones.

26:52.150 --> 26:54.777
Sergeant, Malraux back yet?

26:54.778 --> 26:57.488
No, sir, he is not.
It's been a couple of hours.

26:57.489 --> 27:01.366
He's probably up on Grid 12 though.
Should I send a patrol out for him?

27:01.367 --> 27:04.995
No, no, no.
Don't put any of our people in jeopardy.

27:04.996 --> 27:08.874
Besides, the son of a bitch
can climb like a goat. You and I saw that.

27:08.875 --> 27:12.002
He'll show up soon.
Let me know when he gets close.

27:12.003 --> 27:14.671
I want to have a conversation
with Her Highness.

27:14.672 --> 27:19.672
Will do.

27:43.701 --> 27:47.079
<i>- How's it going?
- Four days of negative core samples...</i>

27:47.080 --> 27:51.208
<i>-...but these things take time.
- Well, you may not</i> have <i>more time.</i>

27:51.209 --> 27:54.211
My latest weather reports
don't look that promising.

27:54.212 --> 27:56.380
<i>Is it serious?</i>

27:56.381 --> 28:00.050
- They've got my attention.
- Stop dancing. What are you <i>saying?</i>

28:00.051 --> 28:03.053
I may have to pull the plug
on your boyfriend's party.

28:03.054 --> 28:07.182
<i>Misguided innuendo noted, colonel.</i>

28:07.183 --> 28:09.476
I apologize.

28:09.477 --> 28:11.728
The weather gets my attention.

28:11.729 --> 28:16.729
Over and out.

28:18.695 --> 28:23.695
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Close-- Moving out.

28:24.742 --> 28:29.246
- We can't pull out now!
- My operation. I'll pull out if I want.

28:29.247 --> 28:32.207
I haven't covered half the terrain
I was promised!

28:32.208 --> 28:37.087
Listen to me. You get your shit together
and get ready to leave here in an hour.

28:37.088 --> 28:40.215
Take a look around you.
We got a storm front moving in.

28:40.216 --> 28:44.428
And when it hits,
we'll get stuck in here for a week.

28:44.429 --> 28:47.306
Is Frazer in agreement?

28:47.307 --> 28:50.100
The core samples were inconclusive.

28:50.101 --> 28:55.101
They do not justify any further
financial involvement by the company.

28:55.356 --> 28:58.400
Sir!
The chopper will be at Northgate at 0900.

28:58.401 --> 29:03.401
Thank you, sergeant. One hour.

29:05.408 --> 29:07.826
- Get them moving.
- You heard the man.

29:07.827 --> 29:12.827
Move it, move it, move it!

33:07.900 --> 33:10.235
Describe the genetic
modification factors.

33:10.236 --> 33:14.156
Okay. Two parts for proof.

33:14.157 --> 33:17.534
Physical examination, x-ray scans...

33:17.535 --> 33:18.785
...autopsy.

33:18.786 --> 33:21.997
Second part, most important.

33:21.998 --> 33:24.791
Blood work.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.209
This is exciting.

33:26.210 --> 33:29.880
It's much, much more than I expected.

33:29.881 --> 33:34.881
Dr. Malraux, you don't seem excited.
Why?

33:35.261 --> 33:39.598
Maybe you've been searching so long,
and now that the search is over...

33:39.599 --> 33:44.599
It's just the beginning, Miss Frazer.

33:50.693 --> 33:55.693
Specimen Frozen 1.

33:56.115 --> 34:01.036
White male, early 30s.

34:01.037 --> 34:06.037
Winter-issue uniform.

34:10.087 --> 34:15.087
Wool inserts.

34:15.635 --> 34:20.635
Coat, jacket, gloves.

34:23.684 --> 34:27.187
Would you say it's equivalent
to finding Amelia Earhart's plane?

34:27.188 --> 34:30.398
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Definitely not Titanic.

34:30.399 --> 34:34.027
Probably like the ice man they found
in the Alps. There's a spin.

34:34.027 --> 34:37.697
Unless we find something patentable.
Now that would be special.

34:37.697 --> 34:41.117
Con 7 can have the bodies
transported anywhere in the world.

34:41.118 --> 34:44.829
We can even have them clear
Canadian customs if you so desire.

34:44.830 --> 34:47.290
You're thorough.
Expensive, but thorough.

34:47.291 --> 34:48.542
Yes, ma'am.

34:48.543 --> 34:52.462
If there's nothing valuable on the bodies,
we'll notify the Russians.

34:52.463 --> 34:55.047
Let them deal with transportation
for burial.

34:55.049 --> 34:57.300
IV gets a public relations opportunity.

34:57.301 --> 35:00.512
It could open future business.
I'm still on the plus side.

35:00.513 --> 35:02.722
- Storm damage?
-Including storm damage.

35:02.723 --> 35:04.766
As long as we don't overstay here.

35:04.767 --> 35:09.767
I could have essential personnel
and equipment out of here in five days.

35:09.814 --> 35:12.566
Make it four,
and you have my next project.

35:12.567 --> 35:17.567
Four days it is.

35:19.782 --> 35:22.659
Yes.

35:22.660 --> 35:27.660
Condition of the corpse, remarkable.

35:31.586 --> 35:36.586
Andrew, this is proof.

35:40.261 --> 35:45.261
Let's grab some tissue and fluid samples
and start the lab work.

35:45.433 --> 35:49.811
Let's x-ray before we autopsy.

35:49.812 --> 35:52.522
Look at the bone density.

35:52.523 --> 35:56.026
Even in hands, phalanges,
proximal bones.

35:56.027 --> 36:00.196
This is strength.

36:00.197 --> 36:03.700
I can't wait for the blood work.

36:03.701 --> 36:07.412
We'll be looking at those slides
for days.

36:07.413 --> 36:12.413
I wanna take another shot
at the upper torso.

36:21.594 --> 36:26.594
Make Dr. Lobokoff famous.

36:32.980 --> 36:36.983
Wait.

36:36.984 --> 36:41.984
Impossible.

36:43.407 --> 36:46.660
Andrew.

36:46.661 --> 36:48.244
Call the colonel.

36:48.245 --> 36:53.041
- What?
- This one is alive.

36:53.042 --> 36:55.585
This one is alive.

36:55.586 --> 37:00.586
Alive.

37:37.086 --> 37:41.047
Dr. Lobokoff, can you turn that down?
Sergeant Gibbs is watching him.

37:41.048 --> 37:46.048
He doesn't know what to do.
Power goes off, no life support...

37:46.345 --> 37:48.138
...we lose greatest discovery.

37:48.139 --> 37:50.640
Here. It's coming to you now.

37:50.641 --> 37:53.685
Lobokoff, turn it down.

37:53.686 --> 37:56.813
The sergeant sees anything,
he'll call you.

37:56.814 --> 38:01.814
Dr. Malraux.

38:05.489 --> 38:09.367
Lobokoff, tell me, how is it possible
for these men to be alive'?

38:09.368 --> 38:11.870
I thought freezing destroyed cells.

38:11.871 --> 38:14.789
Not these cells.

38:14.790 --> 38:17.000
Stempky, a genius.

38:17.001 --> 38:20.170
Maybe the greatest scientific discovery
in human history.

38:20.171 --> 38:21.421
What does it mean?

38:21.422 --> 38:26.422
Well, it means that we can create cells
not only to destroy diseases...

38:28.471 --> 38:31.473
...lengthen our life expectancy...

38:31.474 --> 38:36.474
...but also to give growth
to more desirable body traits.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.273
Yeah, create soldiers.

38:40.274 --> 38:42.025
That's an extremist vision.

38:42.026 --> 38:46.404
Well, is it? Wasn't the original plan
to mount a terrorist attack on New York?

38:46.405 --> 38:47.906
They are soldiers.

38:47.907 --> 38:49.991
Moral and ethical questions abound.

38:49.992 --> 38:52.285
Why are you concerned about ethics?

38:52.286 --> 38:55.663
Why aren't you? Has anyone considered
what would happen...

38:55.664 --> 38:59.959
...if Russians got their hands on this?
Especially that gang in charge now.

38:59.960 --> 39:03.922
Who do nothing but trumpet about
the good old days of the Soviet Union.

39:03.923 --> 39:08.551
That is a very important aspect
and should not be taken lightly.

39:08.552 --> 39:11.554
Is it not true now
that the genie is out of the bottle?

39:11.555 --> 39:13.890
There would seem to be
no going back.

39:13.891 --> 39:15.809
Besides, IV owns the patents.

39:15.810 --> 39:17.268
Who said that? Who?

39:17.269 --> 39:19.646
- We funded this expedition.
- I knew it.

39:19.647 --> 39:22.941
You stab us in the back
as soon as you can.

39:22.942 --> 39:24.567
No, Dr. Lobokoff.

39:24.568 --> 39:29.568
Protect you. Or do you wanna
take on the Russians by yourself?

39:29.782 --> 39:32.450
No. No. Never.

39:32.451 --> 39:35.912
Again, I want everyone
to think this through.

39:35.913 --> 39:39.165
What better company to protect you
than IV Industries?

39:39.166 --> 39:41.125
- Go on.
-IV will have no trouble...

39:41.126 --> 39:44.087
...keeping wraps on our discovery
as long as needed...

39:44.088 --> 39:48.591
...to tidy up any loose ends.
Our lawyers will act as a shield for you.

39:48.592 --> 39:52.428
The corporation will take the hit
for anything that turns out illegal.

39:52.429 --> 39:54.097
She's right, Vladi.

39:54.098 --> 39:56.474
Working with IV is to our advantage.

39:56.475 --> 39:59.769
Before we make a move,
I'll negotiate deals for all of us.

39:59.770 --> 40:03.356
We have incredible leverage.
You ready to back up those claims...

40:03.357 --> 40:06.734
-...of shipping the bodies anywhere?
- Tell me where and when.

40:06.735 --> 40:09.279
Give me a couple of hours
to research options.

40:09.280 --> 40:14.075
Doctors will give you a list for immediate
transportation out, and maintenance.

40:14.076 --> 40:19.076
- And I mean everything.
- Asset time, Miss Frazer.

40:19.248 --> 40:24.248
You got it.

40:42.646 --> 40:45.481
- Evening, sergeant.
- Doc.

40:45.482 --> 40:47.317
How is everything?

40:47.318 --> 40:49.152
Pretty damn incredible.

40:49.153 --> 40:51.905
It seems like these boys
are getting stronger.

40:51.906 --> 40:56.492
- That's what I was afraid of.
- I don't know what these boys are on...

40:56.493 --> 41:01.456
...but I need to get me some. Lord knows
I'm still spent from that search operation.

41:01.457 --> 41:03.541
Why don't you take a break?

41:03.542 --> 41:06.210
I'll watch these guys for a bit.

41:06.211 --> 41:09.714
We both know how the colonel gets
about sticking to protocol.

41:09.715 --> 41:14.715
Don't worry about Trump.
I'll take care of him.

41:15.512 --> 41:17.597
All right.

41:17.598 --> 41:20.475
I could use a refill. I'll be back in a few.

41:20.476 --> 41:23.186
All right.

41:23.187 --> 41:28.187
Take your time.

42:09.775 --> 42:14.775
<i>Life support terminated.</i>

42:18.325 --> 42:23.325
What in the hell is going on here?
Goddamn it. Hey!

42:25.082 --> 42:30.082
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

42:32.297 --> 42:37.297
- Back off.
- You're a lot stronger than you look, boy.

42:44.476 --> 42:47.103
Sergeant? What the hell is going on?

42:47.104 --> 42:49.105
He's trying to kill them, sir.

42:49.106 --> 42:54.106
Andrew. Stop it!

42:59.450 --> 43:02.493
Tie him up.

43:02.494 --> 43:05.329
You heard the man. Tie him up.

43:05.330 --> 43:08.666
It's bad.

43:08.667 --> 43:13.667
Did he kill them?

43:18.135 --> 43:23.135
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

43:24.933 --> 43:29.933
Lobokoff,
what am I supposed to be looking at?

43:31.190 --> 43:36.190
He doesn't need life support anymore.

43:47.873 --> 43:49.999
Please, can we just get started?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.919
- You can't be serious.
- He's very serious.

43:52.920 --> 43:55.671
It's protocol.

43:55.672 --> 43:58.716
Starting recording.

43:58.717 --> 44:03.638
Now, for the record,
Dr. Andrew Malraux.

44:03.639 --> 44:08.639
Do you deny attempting
to kill three human beings?

44:10.020 --> 44:12.396
They're not human beings.

44:12.397 --> 44:16.234
And if they fall into the hands
of the wrong people and governments...

44:16.235 --> 44:17.735
...heaven help us.

44:17.736 --> 44:19.821
They're getting stronger.

44:19.822 --> 44:21.697
And they're going to escape.

44:21.698 --> 44:24.700
Nobody here denies
we're in uncharted territory.

44:24.701 --> 44:29.580
And there may be risks that under normal
circumstances would seem impossible.

44:29.581 --> 44:33.876
But that does not mean
we take extreme preposterous measures.

44:33.877 --> 44:35.128
Preposterous to you.

44:35.129 --> 44:38.214
These are too valuable
for you to be making decisions.

44:38.215 --> 44:39.924
I want it on the record...

44:39.925 --> 44:43.469
...that I'm not completely dismissing
Dr. Malraux's scenario.

44:43.470 --> 44:46.764
If the specimens regain faculties,
we'll deal with it then.

44:46.765 --> 44:51.727
Yes, if they awaken, we'll just tell them
that the Cold War is over.

44:51.728 --> 44:55.773
Yeah, take them to a bar.
Show them the local talent.

44:55.774 --> 45:00.774
Turn the recorder off.

45:19.631 --> 45:24.010
Dr. Malraux, believe me when I tell you,
this option was not undertaken easily.

45:24.011 --> 45:27.680
You left me no choice.

45:27.681 --> 45:31.851
We'll come back in the morning. By then,
you will have found your senses...

45:31.852 --> 45:36.852
...and realized the great opportunity
in front of you.

45:37.191 --> 45:39.775
Andrew.

45:39.776 --> 45:42.278
Andrew.

45:42.279 --> 45:44.238
Forgive me, my friend.

45:44.239 --> 45:49.239
We must keep them alive.

46:01.965 --> 46:03.507
Let's go, sergeant.

46:03.508 --> 46:06.469
Yes, sir.

46:06.470 --> 46:08.721
You men keep an eye on him.

46:08.722 --> 46:13.722
You heard the man.
Nobody gets in. Nobody.

46:57.187 --> 46:58.854
- Sir?
- Yeah?

46:58.855 --> 47:01.524
I'll have a look at those generators
out there.

47:01.525 --> 47:03.359
All right.

47:03.360 --> 47:07.530
But make sure you've got all the cell
phones. I want that blackout enforced.

47:07.531 --> 47:08.781
Will do.

47:08.782 --> 47:10.408
All right.

47:10.409 --> 47:15.409
You know, the real sticky question is,
what are we gonna do with Malraux?

47:16.039 --> 47:19.542
My gut tells me he still has the potential
to be of great value.

47:19.543 --> 47:23.671
Once his head clears. He's worth
waiting on for a limited amount of time.

47:23.672 --> 47:27.800
Keep him under house arrest until
we leave, then we'll see where we stand.

47:27.801 --> 47:32.801
All right.

47:33.557 --> 47:38.102
Well, I am going to go talk to Lobokoff.

47:38.103 --> 47:40.479
See if I can get that extended manifest.

47:40.480 --> 47:45.480
Now that Malraux, the good doctor,
is under lock and key.

47:46.611 --> 47:48.070
Don't hurt the poor man.

47:48.071 --> 47:53.071
- He's all we have for the moment.
- Oh, I'll try.

48:42.167 --> 48:45.753
Won't be long before we're out of here.

48:45.754 --> 48:50.754
Lobokoff, get that goddamn le--

48:52.636 --> 48:57.636
Well, look at you, huh?

49:02.270 --> 49:06.107
Come here.

49:06.108 --> 49:11.108
I've got a little something for you.

50:11.631 --> 50:13.257
Which way is it?

50:13.258 --> 50:15.468
It's ahead.

50:15.469 --> 50:20.469
All right, stand down.

50:28.565 --> 50:33.565
Full access and complete control
of the property. Close the door.

50:39.242 --> 50:44.242
Okay.

51:05.268 --> 51:09.813
No!

51:09.814 --> 51:14.814
- Down here, down here.
- Move, move!

51:19.950 --> 51:22.076
Go, go, go!

51:22.077 --> 51:27.077
Round up the hostile!

54:56.166 --> 55:01.166
Wolves.

55:59.437 --> 56:04.437
You got a smoke?

56:14.953 --> 56:18.914
So, what's your name?

56:18.915 --> 56:21.917
Andrew Malraux.

56:21.918 --> 56:23.418
What do you do?

56:23.419 --> 56:26.213
I'm a scientist.

56:26.214 --> 56:28.173
What's your name?

56:28.174 --> 56:30.592
TC Cardinal.

56:30.593 --> 56:35.593
Cree trapper.

56:35.849 --> 56:40.185
I didn't realize you had wild dogs
this far north.

56:40.186 --> 56:43.438
My father told me many years ago...

56:43.439 --> 56:47.985
...white men brought these vicious dogs
to watch other white men.

56:47.986 --> 56:52.986
And where those white men died,
now these dogs wander.

56:53.992 --> 56:56.994
And their great-grandchildren.

56:56.995 --> 57:00.455
They roam this land.

57:00.456 --> 57:05.456
Very bad dogs.

57:07.922 --> 57:09.256
Here.

57:09.257 --> 57:10.549
Put this on it.

57:10.550 --> 57:14.303
- What is it?
- Antiseptic.

57:14.304 --> 57:19.304
Johnson <i>&</i> Johnson.

57:22.937 --> 57:27.274
I'm looking for three white men.

57:27.275 --> 57:30.986
You can't miss them.

57:30.987 --> 57:32.362
They're very dangerous.

57:32.363 --> 57:37.363
Murdered lots of people. Thanks.

57:38.620 --> 57:42.456
They do that sort of thing.

57:42.457 --> 57:45.417
Where's the nearest town?

57:45.418 --> 57:49.338
There's a trappers camp
about three days walk from here.

57:49.339 --> 57:54.176
I want you to take me there.
I'll pay you.

57:54.177 --> 57:57.179
I took these guys from Toronto
caribou hunting.

57:57.180 --> 57:59.556
They paid me 500.

57:59.557 --> 58:04.557
I'll pay you 500 plus bonus
if you get me there within three days.

58:05.188 --> 58:08.607
Deal.

58:08.608 --> 58:13.608
If you don't pay me, I will shoot you.

58:51.901 --> 58:55.195
Your killers came through here.

58:55.196 --> 58:57.072
And they move fast.

58:57.073 --> 58:59.825
How do you know?

58:59.826 --> 59:02.744
Because I'm an Indian.

59:02.745 --> 59:07.745
I've always wanted to say that.

59:25.560 --> 59:28.770
Your men tried crossing here.

59:28.771 --> 59:33.771
They fell.

59:35.278 --> 59:37.446
See where the ice broke?

59:37.447 --> 59:39.072
Froze again.

59:39.073 --> 59:43.160
They probably headed up river.
If there's a crossing, they will find it.

59:43.161 --> 59:46.788
If we cross here, we save a day's travel
and I get my bonus.

59:46.789 --> 59:49.124
Can we make that?

59:49.125 --> 59:51.376
I hope so.

59:51.377 --> 59:56.377
I can't swim.

01:00:17.862 --> 01:00:22.862
Move!

01:01:00.363 --> 01:01:02.364
Trappers camp.

01:01:02.365 --> 01:01:06.618
These guys don't like outsiders
on their hunting ground.

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:10.205
Maybe they shot your killers.

01:01:10.206 --> 01:01:12.791
Maybe they'll shoot you.

01:01:12.792 --> 01:01:16.920
And if they're pissed up,
maybe they'll shoot at me.

01:01:16.921 --> 01:01:21.921
I'll go down first. Wait here.

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:22.810
Teach you to mess with TC Cardinal.

01:05:26.879 --> 01:05:31.879
You Okay?

01:05:33.886 --> 01:05:37.013
Good.

01:05:37.014 --> 01:05:40.266
Let's get out of here.

01:05:40.267 --> 01:05:44.646
Who the hell were those guys?

01:05:44.647 --> 01:05:47.816
That was not a normal man.

01:05:47.817 --> 01:05:50.485
Are all three of them like that?

01:05:50.486 --> 01:05:52.487
Yes.

01:05:52.488 --> 01:05:55.532
Who are they?

01:05:55.533 --> 01:05:59.994
The same men your father told you
the dogs were brought to watch.

01:05:59.995 --> 01:06:04.995
That can't be, that was 50 years ago.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.586
That's right.

01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:10.296
They're genetic freaks.

01:06:10.297 --> 01:06:14.676
And they will kill and destroy everything
and anything that gets in their way.

01:06:14.677 --> 01:06:17.137
Where's the nearest town?

01:06:17.138 --> 01:06:20.974
Oil Town.

01:06:20.975 --> 01:06:23.017
How far away is that?

01:06:23.018 --> 01:06:25.854
On foot, two, three days.

01:06:25.855 --> 01:06:27.605
How many people?

01:06:27.606 --> 01:06:30.066
About 3000, maybe more.

01:06:30.067 --> 01:06:32.193
Depends on the jobs.

01:06:32.194 --> 01:06:35.363
There's a Russian oil company hiring.

01:06:35.364 --> 01:06:40.364
I owe you 500 plus bonuses.

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:47.580
Thank you.

01:06:48.794 --> 01:06:53.794
Malraux, if you don't pay me,
I will gut you with my father's knife.

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:14.458
Farewell drinks for everyone.

01:08:16.674 --> 01:08:20.343
For you and your friend too, huh?

01:08:20.344 --> 01:08:22.303
Russian?

01:08:22.304 --> 01:08:23.555
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:08:23.555 --> 01:08:26.432
I go to New York tomorrow.

01:08:26.433 --> 01:08:29.894
New York is centre of the universe.

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:33.814
Canadians are slow, Americans stupid.

01:08:33.816 --> 01:08:37.484
We don't need war, we buy New York.

01:08:37.486 --> 01:08:41.613
Then we control the world.

01:08:41.615 --> 01:08:46.615
Send Americans to Russia.
Let them stand in line.

01:08:52.334 --> 01:08:57.334
Give me the bottle.

01:08:58.256 --> 01:09:03.011
Hey, baby.

01:09:03.011 --> 01:09:08.011
Yeah.

01:09:41.466 --> 01:09:43.216
Need a lift?

01:09:43.218 --> 01:09:46.720
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna help you kill those men.

01:09:46.721 --> 01:09:50.558
- No charge.
- Why?

01:09:50.559 --> 01:09:55.559
Just like you. I have to.

01:09:58.859 --> 01:10:02.570
- How's that leg?
- Good.

01:10:02.571 --> 01:10:07.571
You're lucky you're from a different family
of white men. I didn't think you'd make it.

01:10:22.591 --> 01:10:27.345
They're in town somewhere.
Someone must have seen them.

01:10:27.346 --> 01:10:32.346
Start here.

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:39.816
- What's wrong?
<i>- I'll</i> stay here. Keep watch.

01:10:39.817 --> 01:10:44.445
- I need you inside with me.
- I can't go in there.

01:10:44.446 --> 01:10:47.699
When I drink, a demon takes over
and bad things happen.

01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:52.700
We didn't come here to drink.

01:10:56.125 --> 01:10:59.544
You're right.

01:10:59.545 --> 01:11:02.422
Something I gotta do.

01:11:02.423 --> 01:11:07.423
- Hey there, lady.
- Hi.

01:11:11.974 --> 01:11:15.643
That's him.

01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:18.271
They call him ogimaa makwa.

01:11:18.272 --> 01:11:19.981
King Bear.

01:11:19.982 --> 01:11:24.982
You sure?

01:11:33.328 --> 01:11:35.705
I'm looking for three Russians.

01:11:35.706 --> 01:11:39.125
They're tall, blond hair.

01:11:39.126 --> 01:11:41.586
You like tall Russian men?

01:11:41.587 --> 01:11:46.587
- Were they here?
- I see lots of those.

01:11:46.842 --> 01:11:48.843
Go away now. You're bothering me.

01:11:48.844 --> 01:11:51.387
This Mitka Dorovich's farewell party,
okay?

01:11:51.388 --> 01:11:56.388
Fly to New York tomorrow.

01:11:58.604 --> 01:12:01.731
Once killed a man in a bar
just like this.

01:12:01.732 --> 01:12:06.732
Don't make me do it again.

01:12:07.196 --> 01:12:11.240
One more time.

01:12:11.241 --> 01:12:14.452
Yeah, they were in here,
looking for work with explosives.

01:12:14.453 --> 01:12:17.371
I tell them where to go.

01:12:17.372 --> 01:12:22.168
- Where?
- Mine. Edge of town.

01:12:22.169 --> 01:12:27.169
He knows.

01:12:54.576 --> 01:12:56.577
Varamutska.

01:12:56.578 --> 01:12:58.246
Varamutska. What's that?

01:12:58.247 --> 01:13:01.666
It's a small Siberian village
they attacked 50 years ago.

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:05.461
One will try and cut the power,
second will assassinate leaders...

01:13:05.462 --> 01:13:08.172
...and the third
will assault the police force.

01:13:08.173 --> 01:13:11.259
If we can stop Number 1
from cutting the town's power...

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.096
...we may be able to prevent the other two
from attacking. Right here.

01:13:15.097 --> 01:13:20.097
Power grid. North Road.

01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:27.400
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:13:27.401 --> 01:13:32.401
Welcome to Oil Town.

01:13:33.282 --> 01:13:36.117
<i>Okay, 'BOYS-</i>

01:13:36.118 --> 01:13:41.118
Turn around.

01:13:48.672 --> 01:13:52.758
That's not even close
to the craziest story I've ever heard.

01:13:52.759 --> 01:13:56.554
I'm just trying to warn you.

01:13:56.555 --> 01:14:01.555
You ever heard of polar light?
People come up here, never see the sun.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:03.978
They go kind of crazy.

01:14:03.979 --> 01:14:06.480
See things that aren't there.

01:14:06.481 --> 01:14:07.982
Polar light.

01:14:07.983 --> 01:14:12.486
I think that's what's happened to you,
Sunshine.

01:14:12.487 --> 01:14:17.487
Short days and long nights.

01:14:19.995 --> 01:14:23.664
You're making a big mistake.

01:14:23.665 --> 01:14:25.833
You, where do you fit into this?

01:14:25.834 --> 01:14:27.168
He's my guide.

01:14:27.169 --> 01:14:31.339
TC Cardinal a guide?
That's a joke. He's a paroled murderer.

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.632
He saved my life.

01:14:32.633 --> 01:14:35.468
Make that a parole violator.

01:14:35.469 --> 01:14:40.469
Stolen handgun's
gonna do that to you, son.

01:14:44.144 --> 01:14:46.729
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:51.400
That's all right. I've been here before.

01:14:51.401 --> 01:14:53.611
Killed a guy.

01:14:53.612 --> 01:14:56.447
Got in a fight when I was drunk.

01:14:56.448 --> 01:14:59.033
He was a real asshole.

01:14:59.034 --> 01:15:04.034
Then when I was in jail,
I got this tattoo to remind me who I was.

01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:09.627
I've been in the bush minding
my own business and then I meet you.

01:15:09.628 --> 01:15:14.628
Then they catch me with a gun
in my hand, and three dead bodies.

01:15:14.925 --> 01:15:17.301
TC Cardinal.

01:15:17.302 --> 01:15:19.845
Murderer.

01:15:19.846 --> 01:15:24.600
What does TC stand for?

01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:29.601
Thunder Cloud.

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:51.419
It's 8 a.m. Let the record state
this morning's session...

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.631
...for open municipal business
has commenced.

01:15:55.632 --> 01:16:00.632
Appropriately, first on the agenda
is our soaring electric bill.

01:16:12.899 --> 01:16:17.899
It's starting.

01:16:39.009 --> 01:16:40.342
Chief, it's the mayor.

01:16:40.343 --> 01:16:45.343
- I can't talk to him right now.
- He's been shot.

01:17:10.665 --> 01:17:15.665
Come on.

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.902
You Okay?

01:17:39.903 --> 01:17:44.903
Go get him.

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:34.870
You shoot, I'll drive.

01:21:06.026 --> 01:21:09.069
They're catching up.

01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:14.070
Hold on.

01:21:34.929 --> 01:21:39.929
No!

01:21:49.444 --> 01:21:51.070
There are only two in there.

01:21:51.071 --> 01:21:53.155
One's missing.

01:21:53.156 --> 01:21:54.865
Where is he, Oil Town?

01:21:54.866 --> 01:21:59.661
No, his mission was New York City.

01:21:59.662 --> 01:22:04.662
Let's go.

01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:48.687
Do you know who I am?

01:23:48.688 --> 01:23:53.688
Do you recognize me?

01:23:56.154 --> 01:23:58.405
Northgate.

01:23:58.406 --> 01:24:03.406
A woman scientist examined me.
I remember her.

01:24:04.954 --> 01:24:09.954
She never forgot the evil that you are.

01:25:54.731 --> 01:25:58.358
You.

01:25:58.359 --> 01:26:02.321
I am in you.

01:26:02.322 --> 01:26:07.322
But not enough.

01:26:08.745 --> 01:26:12.205
You're flawed, pathetic.

01:26:12.206 --> 01:26:16.752
A weak man.

01:26:16.753 --> 01:26:21.753
Now you die.

01:28:48.196 --> 01:28:51.531
It's my father.

01:28:51.532 --> 01:28:55.285
He raped my mother.

01:28:55.286 --> 01:28:58.872
Juliet Malraux.

01:28:58.873 --> 01:29:03.873
She was a government scientist
sent to Northgate to investigate the three.

01:29:07.006 --> 01:29:12.006
Her short life
was full of acute physical pain.

01:29:13.137 --> 01:29:18.137
And fear as to what I may become.

01:29:21.479 --> 01:29:26.479
You're a good man.

01:29:27.235 --> 01:29:32.235
Am I?

01:29:33.305 --> 01:29:39.784
