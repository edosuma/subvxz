00:16.520 --> 00:20.100
Help me, please, help me!

00:24.840 --> 00:27.660
Somebody, help!

00:30.640 --> 00:32.540
Help me!

00:35.000 --> 00:37.580
Help! Get me out, please!

00:54.240 --> 00:56.940
Three boys dead, Singo.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.340
Jesus Christ.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.540
Young Officer Kendall.

02:58.600 --> 03:01.900
Joe, old Mrs Haig called,
out past Beckett.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.580
She reckons there's someone
in her shed.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.780
Yeah, doing what?
Well, nothing. Her dog's barking.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.860
Thought I'd go sort it out.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.340
I'll go.
I can do it.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.180
No, I'm nearby.
Tell her I'll be there in 15 minutes.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.540
You the cop? No uniform.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.420
Plain clothes. Detective Cashin.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.620
You high up, then?
Giddy from it.

03:47.080 --> 03:48.780
Them police dogs?

03:48.840 --> 03:51.700
They work closely with the police,
yes.

03:52.960 --> 03:53.900
Shut up!

03:53.960 --> 03:56.980
Jack Russell?
Yeah.

03:57.040 --> 03:59.140
So where's this intruder?

04:16.160 --> 04:18.860
Police! Get out of there now.

04:19.839 --> 04:21.459
Come on, last chance. Get out!

04:28.560 --> 04:32.460
That'll do. You're trespassing
on private property.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.540
Was just having a sleep.

04:34.600 --> 04:38.500
Where you from?
From New South.

04:38.560 --> 04:43.060
It's a long way to come for a kip.
Yeah, it's a way.

04:43.120 --> 04:47.900
Got any ID? Been in trouble before?
I could have been bloody molested.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.660
Very possible, Mrs Haig.
Hey, hey, hey!

04:51.720 --> 04:54.860
Get your hand out of there.
Take your jacket off.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.580
You're a bit shaky, aren't ya?

05:08.440 --> 05:10.700
Dave Rebb. Is that you?
Yep.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.620
You worked Boorindi Downs
for three years? Queensland.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.340
'Hard worker, no trouble,
likes building, good with engines.'

05:17.400 --> 05:22.900
August 2006. That all you got?
Are you charging him or chatting?

05:22.960 --> 05:26.540
Mrs Haig, he'll be lucky to see
the light of day for years to come.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.620
Get your stuff.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.180
Don't lock me up.
I can't go in the cells.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.380
That's the road to Cromarty.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.860
You come back the Port Monro
direction,

05:38.920 --> 05:42.020
I'll have to take you in
for fingerprinting, OK?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.660
Save ink this way.

05:48.080 --> 05:52.820
Need a buck or two?
I'm right. But thanks.

05:52.880 --> 05:55.100
You treated me like a human.
Not a lot do that.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.300
I've got a fence needs putting up.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.740
Sit tight, will ya?

06:30.240 --> 06:34.260
Why would I walk around
with some frozen chook

06:34.320 --> 06:36.100
shoved down me fucking trackie daks?

06:36.160 --> 06:37.580
Settle, I'll take your statement.

06:37.640 --> 06:40.420
She accused me in front
of everyone at IGA!

06:40.480 --> 06:43.140
What you should do,
you should arrest her!

06:43.200 --> 06:44.620
Hello, sweetheart.

06:44.680 --> 06:46.460
You know, I reckon you should try

06:46.520 --> 06:48.260
the good folk
down at Maxwell's supermarket.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.460
Oh, that's right, they know you
there as well, don't they?

06:50.520 --> 06:51.940
Yeah, you're an arsehole.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.900
You and your whole bloody family,
you're arseholes!

06:53.960 --> 06:55.500
There's no need to be like that,
Jadeen.

06:55.560 --> 06:58.340
Yeah, fuck you!
Hey, happy shopping.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.420
Fuck you!

07:02.600 --> 07:04.340
We should have charged her
this time.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.940
Yeah, not if you want to live here.

07:06.000 --> 07:10.780
That Toyota HiAce van
was seen near the school again.

07:10.840 --> 07:14.420
Ah, anyone think
to get a number plate?

07:14.480 --> 07:18.740
One of the teachers said it was
white or maybe cream or yellow.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.020
Oh, yeah? That's useful.
Hmm!

07:21.080 --> 07:24.140
I take it there were no dramas?
No, it's just a swaggie.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.380
Boss, I am applying for a transfer.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.900
Are ya?
Mm. I'm sick of this.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.540
You protecting me.
Oh, shut up. I'm not protecting you.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.460
No, worse. You're smothering me.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.540
Oh, you can take a bullet for me
anytime. Promise.

07:40.600 --> 07:44.260
Egg and bacon roll?
Hey, tell 'em extra mustard.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.380
There's someone in your car.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.940
Yeah, he's my prisoner.
Get him a serve as well, will ya?

08:47.480 --> 08:49.140
Who's there?

09:03.080 --> 09:04.940
Show yourselves.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.380
Who the devil are you?

09:28.600 --> 09:32.500
No. Please.

09:47.640 --> 09:52.020
Yeah, that's him.
Oh, shit, he's onto us.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.980
What's he bloody doing?
Shit, watch out!

10:31.920 --> 10:34.140
How come you walk
like you're scared you'll break?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.940
You like a good yarn, do you?

10:40.840 --> 10:43.980
Whereabouts you grow up?
All over.

10:44.040 --> 10:50.700
Yeah? Where were you born?
Don't remember. I was a baby.

10:54.720 --> 10:57.540
Up for a good chinwag yourself, then?

11:00.040 --> 11:04.860
Belonged to my great-grandfather.
Put a stick of gelignite under it.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.420
The right idea.
I thought I might rebuild it.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.860
Plant some fruit trees.
Put in a garden.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.420
The fence follows a creek
on the other side.

11:19.480 --> 11:20.940
I'll get you a tape measure.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.420
Ah, don't worry about it.
Use me feet.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.980
Bluestone. It's tricky stuff.
You worked with it?

11:32.040 --> 11:36.180
You need a block and tackle.
Punch hammer, splitter, chisels.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.940
Mason's trowel.
So you interested in having a go?

11:39.000 --> 11:40.540
I'll do the fence first.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.540
Just see how that goes.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.180
Yeah.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.340
Shit.

12:09.440 --> 12:13.180
Intubation indicated
and 100ml of Lidocaine.

12:13.240 --> 12:14.660
Charles Bourgoyne?

12:14.720 --> 12:17.380
Bashed. Bludgeoned and burned,
more accurately.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.860
That's all I know.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.980
Significant open head injury
and probable brain herniation.

12:22.040 --> 12:25.180
That's no good.
No, it's a three on a coma scale.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.380
That's out of three, not ten.
Come on, let's move it.

12:31.080 --> 12:35.180
G'day, Carol. I'm Joe Cashin.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.140
I know who you are. Sybil's boy.
Yeah.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.340
Not the architect.
No.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.300
Architects generally steer clear
of assault and battery.

12:45.440 --> 12:47.060
You haven't touched anything here,
have you?

12:47.120 --> 12:48.980
No.
Good.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.540
Aren't you some big detective
with the homicide squad?

12:53.480 --> 12:56.620
No. I'm a regular cop these days.

12:58.040 --> 13:00.060
How long you worked here, Carol?
36...

13:00.120 --> 13:03.540
Be careful of the blood here.
36 years.

13:03.600 --> 13:06.260
17 when I started.
Yeah, right.

13:06.320 --> 13:09.940
His life shrunk down
to just four rooms.

13:10.000 --> 13:14.940
Who would have done this to him?
Oh... Mr B had no enemies.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.740
No-one.
No-one else lives here?

13:18.800 --> 13:23.060
The stepdaughter, Erica,
was here day before yesterday.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.860
First time I seen her in years.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.140
Who else works here?

13:27.200 --> 13:28.980
Bruce Starkey is the gardener,

13:29.040 --> 13:31.500
if you call sitting on your arse
all day gardening.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.980
You've seen the place.

13:33.040 --> 13:37.180
His son, Tay,
does what's left of the lawns.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.980
Bit simple, the boy.

13:39.040 --> 13:43.540
Oh, and there's Cecily Addison.
She keeps his accounts.

13:43.600 --> 13:46.340
Anything out of place
when you got here?

13:46.400 --> 13:48.740
His watch is missing.

13:48.800 --> 13:51.860
He always took it off at night
and put it on the stool.

13:51.920 --> 13:53.940
This one?
Yeah.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.540
A gold Branlau. White face.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.780
Very valuable.
With a crocodile band.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.940
Alright, nobody touches anything!

14:03.840 --> 14:06.300
Nobody leaves.
Really?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.100
I was just going to do a quick
hoover.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.940
I'm Senior Detective Rick Hopgood,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.940
head of criminal investigation
at Cromarty.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.580
And you are?
Joe Cashin, Sheriff at Port Monro.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.380
Don't they give you a uniform?
Yeah.

14:29.680 --> 14:36.380
End of shift. Go back to looking
after dolphins in Port Monro.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.780
Carol, Rick here'll look after you.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.580
If you need anything,
give me a ring at Port Monro.

14:44.640 --> 14:46.700
Thank you.
Take care. Thanks.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.780
Vinegar.
Sorry I was so harsh before, mate.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.940
Call on your expertise if needed.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.260
Oh, you're right.
We're all on the same team.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.660
Oh, yeah? Who told you that?

15:30.840 --> 15:34.700
The old bloke OK?
How'd you know about Bourgoyne?

15:34.760 --> 15:36.900
Bruce Starkey,
I'm the gardener here.

15:36.960 --> 15:40.660
Detective Hopgood rang me.
Yeah, how do you know him?

15:40.720 --> 15:42.540
Why'd he do that?
I don't know.

15:42.600 --> 15:46.100
ESP? Open things up?

15:52.880 --> 15:54.420
So, that it?

15:54.480 --> 15:57.020
Biggest crime we've had outside
shoplifting and drunken brawls,

15:57.080 --> 15:58.740
and you're leaving it all
to Cromarty?

15:58.800 --> 16:00.220
Yep.

16:08.640 --> 16:13.940
Dad! Dad! Over here, come on!
Come on! To me! To me!

16:15.480 --> 16:19.140
Catch, Joe.
Over here! Yeah!

16:27.040 --> 16:30.060
I understand you looked after
Charles Bourgoyne's accounts, Cecily?

16:30.120 --> 16:34.140
Bob Menzies was still PM
when I started working for him.

16:34.200 --> 16:37.820
You know he paid his own bills,
phones, electricity?

16:37.880 --> 16:40.100
Didn't even own a house
when he left Canberra.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.220
Sorry, Bourgoyne?
No, Menzies.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.380
Charles had people
to do everything for him.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.380
Yeah, his money came from generators
or something, didn't it?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.940
It came from his old man.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.060
Any farm or shearing shed
that wasn't on the grid,

16:51.120 --> 16:54.820
and that was just about the lot of
them, bought Bourgoyne generators.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.620
Charles gave most of it away.
Money never interested him much.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.820
His Trust helped hundreds of kids.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.780
Even bailed out
the local football team

17:03.840 --> 17:06.300
when your bloody cousin
put them in debt.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.460
Any thoughts on
who would have bashed him?

17:08.520 --> 17:11.180
It'll be some passing hoon
chasing money for drugs.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.220
Whole coast is crawling with them.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.619
But you watch them blame the Abos.

17:15.680 --> 17:19.540
You'd think all the white trash
in Cromarty was at choir practice.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.339
You know, 40 years in the courts,

17:22.400 --> 17:26.300
I've seen more blacks fitted up
than I've had glasses of shiraz.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.460
Bourgoyne's wife's dead?

17:29.520 --> 17:31.540
His whole life has been plagued
by tragedy.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.980
First his wife,
then his stepson Jamie.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.180
I'm afraid Charles
is the end of the line.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.140
Except for his stepdaughter.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.220
I'd like to see his financial records
if I could.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.420
Cromarty Police picked them up.
I thought they were handling this.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.420
Yes, they are.

17:46.480 --> 17:50.460
Jesus, you got the elves working,
Dave? In the rain and all.

17:50.520 --> 17:54.020
Work's work.
Can't let the rain stop ya.

17:54.080 --> 17:57.860
Stops me.
Pulling your zip down.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.260
That's work for a copper.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.940
Hello? Excuse me?
What the hell is this?

18:06.000 --> 18:09.500
G'day, Helen Castleman.
Yes?

18:09.560 --> 18:12.260
Joe. Joe Cashin, from school.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.220
I thought I recognised you
in the street.

18:14.280 --> 18:15.780
Oh!
How're you going?

18:15.840 --> 18:22.180
Joe. I don't remember you
being so tall and thin.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.540
I had a late growth spurt.
No, no, I remember you.

18:27.960 --> 18:30.300
Uh, what the hell is going on here?

18:30.360 --> 18:32.860
I just bought this land
off the Taylors.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.220
Building a fence.

18:36.280 --> 18:39.060
But don't worry,
I won't ask you to pay for it.

18:39.120 --> 18:42.980
Well, that's very generous of you
but, um, it's on my land,

18:43.040 --> 18:45.260
so I want to take it down.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.300
The creek is on my property.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.260
Who was your source
for that information?

18:50.240 --> 18:53.700
Uh, the agent.
The agent.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.740
Lawyers listening to agents, eh?

18:56.800 --> 19:00.220
No, the creek's been on Cashin land
for 70 years.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.820
Fine. You want to make an argument
about it, I'm getting a survey...

19:02.880 --> 19:05.420
I'm just telling you it's on my land.
..we'll see about the boundary.

19:05.480 --> 19:06.900
It's not an argument.

19:08.960 --> 19:13.660
Work is to cease forthwith. OK?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.300
Oh, sh... Ow!

19:21.880 --> 19:25.820
What are you looking at?
You falling over.

19:29.760 --> 19:34.340
Hey, thanks for your support.
I'm on her side.

20:21.240 --> 20:25.420
Hey, Bern! What happened to that wood
you're supposed to deliver?

20:30.760 --> 20:35.540
Priority lists.
Top rung - paying customers.

20:35.600 --> 20:39.940
Bottom rung - cheapskate relatives
that give me a hard time.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.300
Friday. Maybe.
Where'd this bluestone come from?

20:46.600 --> 20:48.620
Reputable wholesaler.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.260
You go to Macca's drive-through and
ask where they got their mince from?

20:51.320 --> 20:52.900
What are you charging for this?

20:52.960 --> 20:57.100
Special family price,
50 bucks a stone.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.420
I'll give you a 50-buck delivery fee
to put it back where you found it.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.860
Come on, cuz,
what'll you do with 'em?

21:08.560 --> 21:10.780
They've been sitting in the paddock
for 30 years.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.220
Taking food out
of your own family's mouth.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.300
You been talking to Mum?
Your mum doesn't visit the Daunt.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.100
Too good for us.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.460
Doesn't want nothing to do with
the blackfella side of the family.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.540
Say 250 bucks delivery.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.580
You caught our beloved
Charlie Bourgoyne's attacker yet?

21:34.640 --> 21:36.340
What have you got
against the old boy?

21:36.400 --> 21:39.540
Nothin'. He's our local saint.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.220
Sold the family empire
off to the Poms,

21:41.280 --> 21:42.860
and they put everyone here
on the dole.

21:42.920 --> 21:48.020
Yeah, well, if you hear anything...
So you already think it's one of us.

21:49.280 --> 21:54.060
200 to deliver.
50, delivered tomorrow.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.340
With the bloody wood I paid for.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.620
Piss off!
Police!

22:26.320 --> 22:27.860
Just taking a nap, mate.

22:27.920 --> 22:30.500
I want you to come out
with your pants up.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.980
Hey.
Got some ID?

22:39.040 --> 22:40.580
Yeah, got me driver's
and credit card.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.380
All sorts of shit there
says who I am.

22:46.120 --> 22:48.540
Allan James Morris,
Tilditch Road, Cromarty.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.780
Yeah.
Master builder.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.380
Have your friend step out as well,
please.

22:57.080 --> 22:58.620
F*ck!

23:05.000 --> 23:10.620
Over here, please.
Not you, Allan. You got some ID?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.540
Wow.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.740
Let's see your real one, unless
you want me to call Mum and Dad,

23:21.800 --> 23:23.260
we'll do this down the station.

23:26.480 --> 23:28.020
What do you reckon, Allan?

23:28.080 --> 23:31.020
You're a big man to be jumping a
16-year-old in the back of your van.

23:31.080 --> 23:34.020
Mate, we was just kissing.
Take your pants off for that, do ya?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.820
Kiss with your bum?
You married, Allan?

23:40.200 --> 23:41.940
Sort of.
Sort of?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.780
They got that now, do they?

23:43.840 --> 23:46.340
You do a sort of ceremony
in a kind of church?

23:48.520 --> 23:50.820
Did he threaten you, love?
Did he force you into anything?

23:50.880 --> 23:53.020
Want to make a complaint?
No, nothing.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.740
Please, I don't want any trouble.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.580
Alright. Wait here.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.220
Taking a risk, aren't ya?
Stacey Drouin?

24:03.280 --> 24:05.540
Steve Drouin's niece, isn't it?

24:14.280 --> 24:18.420
Please don't tell them. Please,
alright? They will f*cking kill me.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.660
Please.

24:22.440 --> 24:25.900
She's... She's been
coming onto me day and night, mate.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.900
Well, she's only human, isn't she?
That's right.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.460
Allan, I'm going to put an alert
out on your van.

24:32.520 --> 24:35.340
So you come to Port Monro again,
you do it to build.

24:35.400 --> 24:38.180
Not to root barely legal kids.
We clear?

24:38.240 --> 24:41.140
Crystal clear.
Good. Piss off.

24:43.800 --> 24:46.620
How's your nana?
Yeah, she's OK.

24:46.680 --> 24:49.300
Yeah? You mind waiting for me
in the car?

24:51.760 --> 24:53.900
Yeah?
I went down your way once.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.020
I hear the surfies call Port Monro
Blue Balls Coast.

24:57.080 --> 25:00.460
It's cold enough.
Listen, Joe, this Bourgoyne thing.

25:00.520 --> 25:03.460
Commissioner tells me
she wants it handled by proper cops.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.620
Apparently, the stepdaughter's
some Labor Party lawyer.

25:06.680 --> 25:11.460
Who fucking microwaved the pies?
You don't microwave pies! Jesus.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.620
I want you on this.
Well, hang on, you're...

25:13.680 --> 25:15.820
You're forgetting I'm the cripple
running Port Monro now.

25:15.880 --> 25:17.620
Joe, we're in the middle
of a gang war,

25:17.680 --> 25:20.220
and all my people are currently
committed to the pointless task

25:20.280 --> 25:22.620
of trying to find which particular
prick killed some other prick

25:22.680 --> 25:24.540
for whose death
we should be eternally grateful.

25:24.600 --> 25:26.460
You're still a member of Homicide.

25:26.520 --> 25:27.940
Mate, your partner's dead
and buried.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.060
Not your fault.
It's time to move on.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.980
Forensics come up with anything?
Very useful. He got bashed.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.780
Alarm was off, no break-ins,
no strange DNA,

25:36.840 --> 25:38.420
and one wanker watch missing.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.460
It's a homicide.
The old boy died three hours ago.

25:41.520 --> 25:45.660
What about Cromarty? Hopgood?
They're not Homicide, mate. You are.

25:45.720 --> 25:49.020
You're the best man to lead this.
Mental health sabbatical over.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.060
I want you to have a chat to the
stepdaughter, Ms Erica Bourgoyne.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.700
How's Singo?
Go and visit him.

25:56.760 --> 25:59.900
Go and sit and stare at the
hospital wall for a couple of hours.

26:07.280 --> 26:11.500
John Jacobs, Orton Private Security.
I look after Ms Bourgoyne.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.100
We're going to need to see some ID.

26:13.160 --> 26:17.820
Doesn't really work that way, John.
I'll ask the questions, mate.

26:18.840 --> 26:23.260
Right now I'll get you to wait
out here. This is a crime scene.

26:25.720 --> 26:29.300
Ms Bourgoyne, I'm Joe Cashin.
I'm very sorry for your loss.

26:30.200 --> 26:34.500
Um... let's make this
as quick as possible.

26:34.560 --> 26:35.980
Of course.

26:36.040 --> 26:38.180
Did your father keep money
on the property?

26:38.240 --> 26:40.980
My stepfather? I... I don't know.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.980
You don't notice anything
out of place here, do you?

26:48.040 --> 26:50.380
Oh, look, I don't think
I can be much help to you.

26:50.440 --> 26:53.980
I'm pretty much a stranger here.
You were here last week, though.

26:54.040 --> 26:58.100
Oh, briefly. My stepfather,
we weren't very close.

26:59.280 --> 27:04.300
More interested in art. We met in
town. We're selling some property.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.860
How old were you
when your mother died?

27:15.920 --> 27:17.020
Young.

27:17.080 --> 27:22.620
And your brother?
Jamie, he drowned in '93, Tasmania.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.100
So you're the sole heir
to this estate?

27:25.160 --> 27:27.140
Oh, I don't know. Got no idea.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.540
I don't think my stepfather
really thought about death.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.660
It was something
for the common people.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.820
This picture's interesting.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.300
Why would they slash that?
Good taste?

27:44.040 --> 27:47.740
That's the old kids' camp.
Part of the land development.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.900
It's up for sale, isn't it?
Yeah. Yeah, I believe so.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.740
Is that what you were here for?
Hmm. Yeah.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.140
So there's an interest in the estate?

28:02.000 --> 28:04.940
Hmm. Yeah.

28:08.280 --> 28:11.220
Suppose that's what it looked like
before it burnt down.

28:11.280 --> 28:12.740
Yeah, sort of.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.660
Anyway, the fire was March 12, '83.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.060
That's a good memory.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

28:22.120 --> 28:25.140
No, I've got a very bad memory.
No, it was the...

28:25.200 --> 28:28.940
It was the night my mother died.
She fell down those stairs.

28:31.240 --> 28:35.140
That's Charles's
pottery workshop.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.420
I take it that's not
your father's work?

28:43.480 --> 28:47.220
Ah, no. He used to run classes
occasionally for children.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.100
Are we finished?
What's that?

28:55.560 --> 28:57.100
No idea.

28:58.280 --> 29:01.260
Rejects. You alright?

29:05.000 --> 29:09.340
Why the bodyguard, Erica?
Comes with the job.

29:09.400 --> 29:13.420
Really? I had no idea being
a Labor Party lawyer was so fraught.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.820
You don't know politics.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.100
Get you to give that back
to John for me.

29:33.480 --> 29:34.700
Hey.

29:34.760 --> 29:38.300
What are you like at jigsaw puzzles?
I hate them.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.220
Ah.
What is this?

29:41.280 --> 29:43.220
Oh, you're going to
put it back together for me.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.620
No.
Yeah.

29:45.680 --> 29:46.900
Why?

29:46.960 --> 29:49.820
I thought we could reintroduce
arts and crafts back into the force.

29:49.880 --> 29:51.420
No?

29:53.040 --> 29:55.100
I'm lousy at jigsaws.

29:55.160 --> 29:59.020
Well, you start with the base pieces.
81's kind of blue.

30:00.440 --> 30:04.660
79's kind of green and flecky.
Work your way up from there.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.540
Afternoon's work.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.580
There you go. Want a nice
almond bickie to go with that?

30:11.640 --> 30:13.540
Oh, no, thanks, Liam. I'm right.

30:13.600 --> 30:15.940
Right, well, there goes my profit
for the winter.

30:17.840 --> 30:20.380
Eight weeks a year
this place comes to life.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.700
The rest of the year
some pensioners,

30:22.760 --> 30:24.660
the unemployed and the unemployable.

30:24.720 --> 30:26.540
You're forgetting the halt
and the lame.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.860
There is always us.

30:28.920 --> 30:31.260
Two virile, single young men,

30:31.320 --> 30:34.460
marooned on an island
of old women in sandals.

30:34.520 --> 30:38.780
How did we end up here?
What the hell brought you back?

30:38.840 --> 30:41.260
I'm recuperating.
Liam?

30:41.320 --> 30:45.420
Would you mind if I put one of these
up? And this petition?

30:45.480 --> 30:46.900
Yeah, sure.

30:46.960 --> 30:50.140
Might galvanise the five people
who see it into a political frenzy.

30:51.720 --> 30:53.620
Joe.
Helen.

30:53.680 --> 30:58.060
Got a permit for that?
Oh, here we go.

30:58.120 --> 31:01.060
You are going to try and prevent us
from having a peaceful march?

31:01.120 --> 31:04.380
Am I? Why would I do that?

31:04.440 --> 31:07.780
Well, it figures that anyone
who can erect fences

31:07.840 --> 31:09.140
without any sort of consultation...

31:09.200 --> 31:11.940
I take it you checked with the
council
and you discovered I was right.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.900
This is a giant development
smack on the river mouth.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.300
But you're more worried
about your damned forms.

31:18.360 --> 31:20.820
Pretty worried.
Will council pass this?

31:20.880 --> 31:25.020
Following a detailed three-minute
environmental impact study,

31:25.080 --> 31:26.660
yeah, they'll jump on it.

31:26.720 --> 31:29.540
Bourgoyne's dead.
You know, bring on the bulldozers.

31:29.600 --> 31:34.260
So now I guess my fight begins
with you and your permit.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.780
You have to have one.
And how long is that going to take?

31:38.840 --> 31:45.020
Oh, what, including the walk to the
station? Probably... eight minutes.

31:45.080 --> 31:48.220
Oh, OK. I mean,
it's eight minutes I'd rather...

31:48.280 --> 31:51.340
Or I could have someone drop it into
your office if that's more
convenient.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.820
Mm, yeah, that might work. Thanks.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.620
Two months ago I was a corporate
lawyer, so it's difficult.

32:07.680 --> 32:13.420
I haven't lived here for a while.
But that shouldn't need a permit.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.140
In a democracy.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.380
Mate, three Aboriginal boys
tried to pawn

32:19.440 --> 32:21.340
a Branlau watch in Sydney yesterday.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.980
Oh, people still wear watches
these days, mate.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.420
The pawn shop manager did
the right thing and got the rego.

32:26.480 --> 32:29.700
Nissan twin cab, TJH 419.

32:29.760 --> 32:33.140
Martin Frazer Gettigan,
14 Holt Street, Cromarty.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.620
Not another Gettigan.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.100
You know them?
There's a lot of Gettigans.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.100
Alright, find out about the ute
without spooking anyone.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.580
Don't take too long.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.500
Martin Gettigan.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.300
You know him?
What?

33:14.360 --> 33:17.620
I'm in a hurry. You know him or not?
Yeah.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.460
Right, I want to know
who's driving Martin's twin cab.

33:21.440 --> 33:23.740
I don't do no bloody police work.

33:23.800 --> 33:28.100
Hey, hey...
Two words - someone's niece.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.860
You got five minutes.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.860
So Gettigan lent his ute
to Luke Walshe and two other kids.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.340
You know 'em?

33:36.400 --> 33:38.140
Your typical Daunt
first Australians.

33:38.200 --> 33:39.740
They've got some minor form.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.980
Suspected of doing some burgs
together, which means they did.

33:43.040 --> 33:46.140
Luke's the oldest,
he fancies he's a fighter.

33:46.200 --> 33:48.500
Pascoe's off his face all the time,

33:48.560 --> 33:50.900
and Donny's a little retard
who tags along.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.860
You know Luke's the venerable
Bobby Walshe's nephew?

33:55.200 --> 33:59.220
Yeah, I figured. How old are they?
Oh, 19, 20.

33:59.280 --> 34:02.660
Donny's younger, maybe 17.

34:02.720 --> 34:05.780
It looks like one of them's tried
to sell Bourgoyne's watch in Sydney.

34:05.840 --> 34:08.980
What say we go pay our respects
to the Coulters?

34:09.040 --> 34:13.100
Well, that'd be seriously
bloody stupid, wouldn't it? Hey?

34:13.159 --> 34:15.659
You're telling me
what's stupid?

34:15.719 --> 34:17.340
I'm conveying a message.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.460
We're not to spook the
Aboriginal community at this point.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.620
Oh. So let's all just head down
to the Daunt and say sorry.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.100
Yeah.

34:29.239 --> 34:31.780
And I'm gonna need
Bourgoyne's financial records.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.380
Believe you've got 'em.

34:46.760 --> 34:50.100
For Christ's sake, put it away,
Sybil.
I'm the local bloody cop.

34:50.159 --> 34:52.620
Oh, stop fussing. I'm your mother.

34:52.679 --> 34:56.780
Now, I heard you're fixing up
your great-granddad's old ruin.

34:56.840 --> 35:01.020
Yeah.
Well, you do know that it's cursed?

35:01.080 --> 35:02.500
It sent Tommy Joe mad.

35:03.520 --> 35:06.220
No, I reckon it's where
the Cashin black dog all started.

35:06.280 --> 35:09.420
I've got a bloke fixing it up
and we'll see how it goes.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.820
I thought your stay here was meant
to be temporary,

35:12.880 --> 35:14.340
just till you got better.

35:14.400 --> 35:16.380
Well, life's pretty temporary,
isn't it, Sybil?

35:18.480 --> 35:21.340
Pour yourself a tea.

35:21.400 --> 35:24.300
Is Harry having Nam flashbacks,
is he?

35:24.360 --> 35:28.100
Love the smell of napalm
in the roses.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.500
Your brother just bought himself
a new unit in Sydney, on the water.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.380
Two bedrooms,
one and a half bathrooms.

35:35.440 --> 35:39.140
What's Michael do in half a bathroom?
Take half a piss?

35:43.080 --> 35:45.940
Is this hash oil?
Yeah, one drop.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.460
It's good for the nerves.
And for pain.

35:49.520 --> 35:53.500
Hm. These tablets seem
to be making him a bit happier.

35:53.560 --> 35:55.700
Yeah, I suppose they've got
medication for that now, don't they?

35:55.760 --> 35:58.060
Being gay and having your lover
go back to his wife.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.620
Ah, but is he really gay, though?
No.

36:00.680 --> 36:03.660
He's a single 44-year-old man
who loves design magazines.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.900
You are such a Cashin.

36:06.960 --> 36:09.940
Even a tragedy's only a tragedy for
five minutes and then it's a joke.

36:10.000 --> 36:11.420
Just like your father.

36:12.720 --> 36:15.540
Well, he needs to get off the tablets
and come here.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.860
No. Nobody needs here.

36:17.920 --> 36:20.060
This place is not good
for either of you.

36:22.040 --> 36:24.740
I don't know how you can spend
a night in that old place.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.500
Those horrible rooms.
It's just a place.

36:28.520 --> 36:33.660
Joseph, after what you've survived,
you could have gone anywhere.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.780
Yeah, alright, then.
You were the bright one.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.460
The police force.

36:39.960 --> 36:42.500
You spend one minute more
in this town than you have to,

36:42.560 --> 36:45.180
you'll be stuck here forever.
Or worse.

36:48.080 --> 36:51.180
Come on, boys, hurry up!
Please, just hurry up!

36:51.240 --> 36:53.380
Where are we going?
We're going on an adventure.

36:53.440 --> 36:58.140
A family adventure. Come on, Joe.
Mum, when are we coming back?

36:58.200 --> 37:00.060
Well, it wouldn't be an adventure
if we knew.

37:00.120 --> 37:03.420
And don't call me Mum anymore.
I'm Sybil.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.140
Very fuckin' convenient.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.820
You were sleeping.
I didn't know where to put 'em.

38:19.880 --> 38:22.620
Oh, so you thought the middle
of the driveway would work.

38:24.000 --> 38:29.100
Oh, I heard you got domestic staff.
Your face is familiar.

38:29.160 --> 38:31.780
You from round here?
No.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.260
Dave, this is Bern.

38:33.320 --> 38:35.460
Ever play footy around here?
Not likely.

38:35.520 --> 38:40.140
Don't often forget faces.
You forgot where to dump the stone.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.180
No, you just forgot
how much I charge to deliver, cuz.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.300
Yeah?

38:51.360 --> 38:53.220
Jesus, been trying to get you
for an hour.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.820
The ute's been sighted in Goulburn,
three occupants.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.740
I don't want any hot pursuit shit.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.580
Well, hang on,
if they're heading back here,

38:59.640 --> 39:01.140
technically it'd be Hopgood's job.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.060
Hopgood bullshit. You're in charge.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.020
The Cromarty mob's
record's appalling.

39:05.080 --> 39:07.060
I'm gonna send a bloke down,
Paul Dove,

39:07.120 --> 39:08.900
Aboriginal, Detective Sergeant.

39:08.960 --> 39:11.580
He'll handle the protocol, capiche?

39:11.640 --> 39:14.900
Yeah, capiche. Whatever that means.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.420
So how you want it done?
Look, I'm open to advice.

39:22.480 --> 39:24.500
No, you're the boss. You tell me.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.380
Villani wants them lifted at home
after they've gone to bed.

39:27.440 --> 39:31.740
Fantastic. Going into the Daunt
at night, arresting our native folk.

39:31.800 --> 39:34.700
It's Indian territory.
'Black Hawk down!'

39:37.440 --> 39:39.340
Alright, we'll set up a roadblock.

39:45.240 --> 39:49.220
Should have taken the pension, mate.
Gone up north, someplace warm.

39:49.280 --> 39:52.660
No, no, no, no.
Court's down the road, champ.

39:52.720 --> 39:54.140
Let him through, Lloydie.

39:57.480 --> 40:01.380
Detective Sergeant Dove.
'Afternoon, lads.

40:04.520 --> 40:06.900
I'm your coconut.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.340
Get the gun! Shoot it!

40:31.400 --> 40:33.380
That's my ball!

40:37.340 --> 40:38.380
Dead ball.

40:38.440 --> 40:41.260
Before I run you through this,
let me first acknowledge

40:41.320 --> 40:45.380
the original custodians of this
glorious shithole we're standing in.

40:45.440 --> 40:48.940
Happy?
Happy Aborigine.

40:50.240 --> 40:54.060
Alright, the Colac boys
have logged the twin cab,

40:54.120 --> 40:56.700
Tango Juliet Hotel 419,

40:56.760 --> 41:01.940
chock-a-block full
of three Abo-indigenes.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.100
We've placed the car
up on the highway,

41:06.160 --> 41:08.420
and they're going to radio through
when they pass.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.140
They're going to head down Anderson.

41:10.200 --> 41:12.700
They're going to continue down
Stockard and then turn right.

41:12.760 --> 41:14.180
This is where
we're gonna nab 'em,

41:14.240 --> 41:17.100
where it's one lane on the corner
of Stockard and Lamen.

41:17.160 --> 41:21.980
Group one - KD, Lloydie, Steggie
and me - we're in the cruiser -

41:22.040 --> 41:24.140
and Sid and Wobbles,
you'll be driving the block.

41:24.200 --> 41:27.100
But it's not some
Green Beret operation.

41:27.160 --> 41:29.300
Nothing happens to these kids.

41:29.360 --> 41:32.300
I've given Inspector Villani an
assurance that seven trained officers

41:32.360 --> 41:34.340
can pick up three kids
without any problems.

41:34.400 --> 41:35.900
I hope that's clear.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.900
Loud and clear.

41:37.960 --> 41:41.980
The code word is
'Vegemite sandwich'.

41:42.040 --> 41:46.380
It's just 'sandwich', thanks.
I'll give the go. It's my call.

41:50.280 --> 41:53.540
You've got the Falcon.
It's in better nick than it looks.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.660
It'd want to be.
What about the white one?

41:55.720 --> 41:57.220
Blown head gasket.

41:58.520 --> 42:00.220
Does this bloke
know what he's doing?

42:00.280 --> 42:01.700
Bloody hope so.

42:12.880 --> 42:16.060
I don't like this rain.
Sandwich 1 in position.

42:16.120 --> 42:17.820
Sandwich 2, roger that.

42:17.880 --> 42:20.260
Sandwich 2,
keep the motor running.

42:20.320 --> 42:24.140
Blocking vehicle is in position.
Righto.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.540
You alright?
Yeah, it's just my back playing up.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.660
You do a lot of these?

42:30.720 --> 42:32.460
I'm doing it as a favour
for Villani.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.580
They're leaning on him
about Bobby Walshe's nephew.

42:34.640 --> 42:37.140
I went to primary school
with Bobby Walshe.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.740
Bobby used to hang out
with my cousin Bern.

42:42.080 --> 42:44.540
They'd beat the shit out of anyone,
those two.

42:44.600 --> 42:47.220
Your cousin Aboriginal?
Aunty Stella's from the Daunt.

42:47.280 --> 42:50.180
So you're a boong-in-law.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.060
Here we go.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.460
Go, go, go, go, go!

43:06.520 --> 43:08.700
What's he doing?
I haven't called it yet.

43:08.760 --> 43:11.540
What the fuck is he doing?!
Bloody idiot! He's pulled a gun.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.780
Go, go, go, go!
Get that prick!

43:17.120 --> 43:22.500
Bloody thing's stalled!
Start, you piece of shit! Go! Fuck!

43:26.920 --> 43:29.220
Fuck me.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.500
Sandwich 2 to Sandwich 1.
Fuck!

43:41.560 --> 43:43.740
Receiving me, over?
Abandon! Tell him call it off.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.420
Sandwich 1, abandon pursuit,
abandon.

43:50.080 --> 43:53.740
I say again, abandon, abandon.
Please respond.

43:55.520 --> 43:57.340
Say again, Sandwich 2,
can't hear you.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.820
Abandon! Abandon!

44:00.360 --> 44:01.700
Watch it!

44:09.880 --> 44:12.260
Come on. Come on!

44:17.640 --> 44:20.500
Get him on his side!
Get him on his side! Come on, mate.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.380
Turn him over gently.
Put it down. Gently!

44:22.440 --> 44:25.660
Put it down!
I said put the firearm down!

44:27.320 --> 44:29.300
Hold your fire!

44:29.360 --> 44:30.860
Turn on the fuckin' flashlight!

44:30.920 --> 44:33.660
Get an ambo! Maximum bloody speed!

44:35.840 --> 44:39.420
No-one touches a bloody thing!
Close the road!

44:39.480 --> 44:42.380
Who the fuck do you think you are,
mate? You're in Cromarty.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.540
Police officers
were fired upon,

44:55.600 --> 44:57.100
and they responded appropriately.

44:57.160 --> 44:58.580
Can you confirm
this was linked

44:58.640 --> 45:00.100
to the murder of Charles Bourgoyne?

45:00.160 --> 45:01.940
We believe it may have been.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.500
Is it true that one of the youths
killed was Luke Walshe,

45:04.560 --> 45:05.980
nephew of the MP Bobby Walshe?

45:06.040 --> 45:09.060
I can't comment at this stage but
I can say every precaution was taken

45:09.120 --> 45:10.540
to minimise the possibility
of injury.

45:10.600 --> 45:13.740
The officers involved
had the utmost respect for protocol.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.220
What the bloody hell
were you thinking?

45:15.280 --> 45:17.620
None of this would've happened
if you'd done what I told you

45:17.680 --> 45:19.100
and arrested them at home!

45:19.160 --> 45:21.300
With all due respect, Luke Walshe
is a violent little arsehole.

45:21.360 --> 45:23.300
He would've shot at us
wherever we picked him up.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.100
You were there to observe.
What'd you observe?

45:25.160 --> 45:27.380
A lot of rain and two dead Abos.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.140
Well, my understanding is he sees
two blokes not in uniform

45:30.200 --> 45:33.060
waving guns about and thinks they're
a couple of hoons out to kill him.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.700
And who told you that?
Donny bloody Coulter?

45:34.760 --> 45:36.180
You save it for the Coroner.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.940
I might just be a country cop,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.620
but since when does the presumption
of innocence lie with an arsehole

45:40.680 --> 45:43.180
pulling an unlicensed firearm
on a fuckin' police officer?

45:43.240 --> 45:44.900
All officers involved
are now on traffic duty

45:44.960 --> 45:46.380
pending an internal investigation!

45:46.440 --> 45:49.500
No phone calls, no winks
over the supermarket trolley!

45:49.560 --> 45:53.060
The family, the brotherhood,
that shit doesn't fly here.

45:53.120 --> 45:54.540
Now get out!

46:02.680 --> 46:03.620
Dove.

46:21.320 --> 46:22.860
Jesus, Joe.

46:25.320 --> 46:29.140
In hindsight, an error of judgement?

46:29.200 --> 46:32.780
I see most of my life
as an error of judgement.

46:35.360 --> 46:38.140
Dove tells me you made three
attempts to call the operation off.

46:38.200 --> 46:42.740
Apparently, he couldn't hear us.
He made a judgement call.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.260
Did you see the muzzle flash
before or after the shots?

46:46.320 --> 46:48.620
Steve, I couldn't see the nose
in front of my face.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.660
So it's possible the muzzle flash

46:50.720 --> 46:53.340
was Walshe firing
after the other shots?

46:55.680 --> 46:57.220
I don't know.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.860
We'd better hope these blokes
did kill Bourgoyne.

47:00.920 --> 47:04.580
There was no watch in the car.
Probably flogged it somewhere else.

47:06.400 --> 47:09.620
Come and stay at my place.
Go and visit Singo.

47:09.680 --> 47:11.420
I've got to go and explain
to the Commissioner

47:11.480 --> 47:15.340
how this total cock-up was actually
a well-executed pincer move

47:15.400 --> 47:17.140
by highly trained professionals.

47:19.080 --> 47:22.420
How do I look?
Ravishing.

47:24.920 --> 47:28.340
Shock and grief.
They are my emotions.

47:28.400 --> 47:30.940
You know, Luke Walshe
is my brother's boy.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.340
He was a bright kid.
Everyone had high hopes for him.

47:34.400 --> 47:35.820
Here you go, Mr Singleton.

47:35.880 --> 47:37.820
One of your old workmates
is here to see you.

47:38.840 --> 47:40.460
G'day, boss.

47:42.840 --> 47:45.140
It's Joe.

47:45.200 --> 47:48.980
Villani reckons you should stop
bunging it on, come back to work.

47:49.040 --> 47:50.900
Place is falling apart without you.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.220
Two youngsters are dead.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.740
White or black,
that's just a tragedy.

48:04.400 --> 48:05.940
Oh, I'll just turn it down.

48:09.560 --> 48:12.140
I don't know if I'm cut out
for this shit.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.140
You used to say you're just a cop.

48:14.200 --> 48:16.180
Say you do your best
and you walk away.

48:16.240 --> 48:21.380
How? I get my partner killed
and now I stuffed up again.

48:23.480 --> 48:26.140
Two kids are dead this time.

48:40.880 --> 48:44.540
You want a pen, boss? Here you go.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.420
C-B 83.

49:05.600 --> 49:09.100
Has Singo ever worked down my way?
No.

49:09.160 --> 49:11.140
Singo worked for 36 years.

49:13.560 --> 49:15.700
Bought himself a place
at Lake Eildon.

49:16.840 --> 49:19.260
Called it Begone Begone.

49:20.360 --> 49:23.660
Then bang, never gets to live in it.

49:23.720 --> 49:26.660
Instead he's dribbling
cream of mushroom soup

49:26.720 --> 49:29.100
down his pyjamas
at an aged-care facility.

49:29.160 --> 49:33.300
Maybe you're right to get out now.
You're telling me to quit?

49:33.360 --> 49:35.100
Your call.

49:35.160 --> 49:38.260
Just don't do that prick Hopgood
any favours at the inquest.

49:38.320 --> 49:40.660
Singo talked about those
with the grip.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.380
Blokes with the power to hurt,

49:46.440 --> 49:48.620
and the power to stop people
from hurting them.

49:49.880 --> 49:51.420
Hopgood's got it in spades.

49:55.440 --> 49:58.460
In a very short time,
I've grown to hate this place.

49:58.520 --> 50:01.860
Yeah, weather's not much.
It's not the weather.

50:01.920 --> 50:03.820
There's something wrong
with this place.

50:03.880 --> 50:06.060
Testing, testing.

50:07.400 --> 50:09.180
It's a shrunken city.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.100
Shrunk right down to the shit.

50:15.360 --> 50:16.900
Sit down, Donny.

50:20.840 --> 50:23.020
How're you going?
Alright.

50:26.680 --> 50:28.940
I'm his mum and he didn't do it.

50:31.160 --> 50:34.060
Helen Castleman
from the Aboriginal Legal Service.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.180
I'll be representing Donny.

50:37.080 --> 50:40.060
I take it you're in charge
of this debacle?

50:41.920 --> 50:43.820
Donny, this is just
a follow-up interview

50:43.880 --> 50:46.420
to see if there's anything you
remember that you want to tell us.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.540
I take it you've advised your client.
Of course.

50:49.600 --> 50:54.260
You are Donald Charles Coulter of 27,
Fraser Street, the Daunt Settlement

50:54.320 --> 50:55.980
at Cromarty, is that right?
Yes.

50:56.040 --> 50:59.060
Before we start, Donny, you're
not obliged to say or do anything,

50:59.120 --> 51:00.780
but anything you do say will be...

51:00.840 --> 51:03.500
My client is going to exercise
those rights.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.860
He's not going to answer
any questions in this interview.

51:09.840 --> 51:13.420
Interview suspended 9:47am.

51:15.040 --> 51:17.540
You care to step outside for a
minute?

51:20.840 --> 51:24.540
You know if Donny tells his story,
there might be no opposition to bail.

51:24.600 --> 51:29.180
What have you got on him?
Being a passenger in a mate's car?

51:29.240 --> 51:32.580
If you've got anything to tell us,
pal, better tell us now.

51:33.840 --> 51:36.020
We were bringing the ute back,
that's all.

51:36.080 --> 51:39.980
It wasn't stealing.
Shh! He's not one of us, love.

51:46.840 --> 51:49.620
If you think you can hold him
while you build a case for murder...

51:49.680 --> 51:51.540
Bail hearing is 12:15.

51:53.520 --> 51:55.580
OK, I will put it to my client.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.660
Bit of history there?
Too good for me.

52:07.120 --> 52:10.980
Donny's mother was with her son
the night of the attack, so no deal.

52:11.040 --> 52:12.700
We have an alibi.

52:12.760 --> 52:15.340
In which case,
bail will be strenuously opposed.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.740
There's a real danger
the witness will abscond.

52:28.560 --> 52:31.620
They spend their whole lives
covering up for their men.

52:32.840 --> 52:38.620
The husbands, the fathers, the sons.
Doesn't matter what the bastards do.

52:38.680 --> 52:42.540
We've got nothing that says Donny was
there when Bourgoyne was murdered.

52:45.400 --> 52:49.420
Oh, I'm black so I'm meant
to empathise with the Daunt boys.

52:49.480 --> 52:51.100
That what you're saying?

52:51.160 --> 52:54.340
No, but keep an open mind. As a cop.

53:08.680 --> 53:11.580
What's going on?
You know he's innocent!

53:14.240 --> 53:17.300
That is bullshit, Cashin.
He's innocent!

53:17.360 --> 53:19.220
The kid gets bail.

53:19.280 --> 53:20.700
Get off your phone!
Alright.

53:20.760 --> 53:23.020
Well, it gives us no leverage.
I know.

53:23.080 --> 53:25.220
But the Minister told the Chief,
the Chief told the Commissioner,

53:25.280 --> 53:28.620
and it's pass
the political hot potato.

53:28.680 --> 53:29.620
Righto.

53:29.680 --> 53:31.820
And I meant to say,
I spoke to Trace.

53:31.880 --> 53:34.060
Apparently, Singo was in Blue Balls.

53:34.120 --> 53:38.020
He never mentioned it. He wasn't
in Homicide then, he was in Arson.

53:38.080 --> 53:41.020
Some fire, way back
in the Jurassic period.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.140
Thanks.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.140
Nuh.

53:48.120 --> 53:50.540
We are not opposing bail.

53:55.880 --> 53:59.580
Dave?
Thought you'd buggered off.

53:59.640 --> 54:01.940
Left me with your mad dogs
and your debt.

54:02.000 --> 54:03.940
That's certainly my follow-up plan.

54:08.480 --> 54:10.620
You ever laid a stone?

54:10.680 --> 54:14.620
I think some things
are best left to the professionals.

54:14.680 --> 54:16.100
That's what they say.

54:27.960 --> 54:30.740
Hey, Coulter,
ya fuckin' gutless bastard!

54:34.200 --> 54:37.300
Hey, Donny, you in there, mate?
Donny, come out!

54:41.040 --> 54:42.580
Come on, get yourself out!

54:42.640 --> 54:44.700
Donny, I'm frightened.
Just go to sleep, mate.

54:44.760 --> 54:46.940
It'll be OK. Just close your eyes.

54:49.480 --> 54:51.140
Sleep, mate.

54:54.280 --> 54:55.820
Get out of here.

54:58.640 --> 55:02.620
Piss off! Go away! Piss off!
Get out of here, now!

55:08.360 --> 55:10.660
Oh, you're having
a golden run, aren't you?

55:10.720 --> 55:13.540
Shoot a couple of kids
and then terrorise the other one.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.660
I'm afraid I need a coffee
before I can listen to your crap.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.660
Are you telling me you know nothing

55:18.720 --> 55:20.380
about the cars
in the Daunt last night?

55:20.440 --> 55:21.860
No, I bloody don't.

55:21.920 --> 55:23.380
Donny's mother said
that there were cars

55:23.440 --> 55:26.820
shining headlights into her house
all night long.

55:26.880 --> 55:29.300
He's scared out of his wits.

55:30.200 --> 55:34.660
Shit, Joe, what are you guys
playing at? Dumb arseholes.

55:41.040 --> 55:43.540
Donny missed his bail appointment
this morning.

55:43.600 --> 55:45.060
Right.

55:47.160 --> 55:49.460
Donny's mum said the little prick's
been a bit weepy.

55:49.520 --> 55:52.140
What do you know about cars
flashing their headlights

55:52.200 --> 55:54.140
into his window all night,
scaring him?

55:58.240 --> 56:01.820
I wasn't on last night.
Fast a-fuckin'-sleep.

56:02.840 --> 56:04.700
I can ask around for you,
if you like.

56:08.360 --> 56:10.740
Pottery classes. Big future.

56:13.640 --> 56:16.980
No, I thought we agreed we'd meet
here then march down to Coun...

56:17.040 --> 56:18.820
Right.

56:19.880 --> 56:22.020
Great.

56:22.080 --> 56:23.500
Sorry.
No, you're alright.

56:23.560 --> 56:25.060
Bit of confusion.

56:25.120 --> 56:27.380
Right, the plan is that we'll
assemble here, do the speeches,

56:27.440 --> 56:30.460
then we will march down Moorhouse,
cross at Enright,

56:30.520 --> 56:32.260
and then finish up
at the Council offices.

56:32.320 --> 56:33.940
OK.
We ready to go?

56:34.000 --> 56:35.300
Ah, yes.

56:35.360 --> 56:39.260
You know Helen? She's
President of Wildcoast Australia.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.420
A person of many parts,
our Ms Castleman.

56:41.480 --> 56:45.620
And you, Detective. One minute
Homicide and now crowd control.

56:45.680 --> 56:47.940
Oh, come on. Don't pick on our Joe.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.940
He's one of the few
that actually signed this petition.

57:00.080 --> 57:01.940
Bobby, do you remember Joe?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.700
Yeah, Joe Cashin. Bern's cousin.

57:04.760 --> 57:07.860
G'day, Bobby. It's been a while.
That's good memory.

57:07.920 --> 57:10.020
Yeah, I wouldn't have finished
primary school without Bern.

57:10.080 --> 57:13.140
Best kid on your side in a fight.
Yeah, that's true.

57:13.200 --> 57:15.460
Just in case you didn't know,
I'm your local Member.

57:15.520 --> 57:18.900
Mate, I'd actually thought
United Australia was a soccer team.

57:18.960 --> 57:21.660
Might as well be.

57:21.720 --> 57:24.700
I understand you were there.
Bad business, eh?

57:24.760 --> 57:26.820
Yeah, kids carrying weapons.

57:26.880 --> 57:29.420
Yeah, well, I'm not here
to stir up shit.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.740
Sad fact is, more votes
in saving penguins

57:31.800 --> 57:33.500
than saving black kids
in this country.

57:33.560 --> 57:35.860
Sorry, we're on.
Good to see you, Joe.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.620
Bobby.

57:40.120 --> 57:42.860
I want to talk to you today
about loss.

57:44.440 --> 57:47.700
You see, I should know.
I'm Aboriginal.

57:48.640 --> 57:51.100
All we seem to talk about is loss.

57:51.160 --> 57:56.580
Our land, our culture
and most recently...

57:58.160 --> 58:00.380
..my beautiful crazy nephew
and his mate.

58:01.440 --> 58:04.260
Everything is taken away from you -

58:04.320 --> 58:06.860
that's the moment
you truly understand

58:06.920 --> 58:09.700
the exquisite pain
that accompanies loss.

58:09.760 --> 58:15.260
How loss can fracture lives,
how it can empty you of hope...

58:15.320 --> 58:19.020
Hopgood's chasing you.
Said to say he's found someone.

58:19.080 --> 58:24.340
I mean, look about you.
This place is paradise.

58:24.400 --> 58:27.700
To my people,
it is a sacred ground area...

58:30.040 --> 58:32.740
Cashin to Cromarty, come in.

58:32.800 --> 58:39.020
...and those that fear it and
must destroy it, we here must care.

58:39.080 --> 58:43.420
To lose is to lose
just one more piece of our soul

58:43.480 --> 58:46.020
until nothing is left.

59:32.920 --> 59:36.420
Donny, Donny, Donny.
Why would he kill himself, eh?

59:36.480 --> 59:42.180
11.95 and a discount voucher
for a pizza.

59:42.240 --> 59:45.420
Everything you live for.
Tip 'em off, did ya?

59:47.440 --> 59:49.860
Transparency, mate.
That's how it's done now.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.740
Bullshit. Have you
even told his mum yet?

59:52.800 --> 59:55.140
You gonna let her find out
on national television?

59:55.200 --> 59:58.180
Well, you can tell her, mate.
I'm not your fuckin' mate.

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.340
Suppose you're not.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:06.620
The case is closed. Not too many
innocent people kill themselves.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.900
Smile for the cameras, mate.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.180
Detective, do you have anything
to say at this stage?

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.660
Yeah, go and get fucked.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.020
Joe?

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.300
How're you going?
I don't know what they are.

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.900
Vases, jugs.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.380
C-B 83. Charles Bourgoyne.

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.500
Just do this one.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.620
Now he tells me.

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.900
And tomorrow, I want you to go into
Cromarty station and steal some
files.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.940
I want everything they've got
on the Companions camp fire of '83.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.420
Why don't we just ask for it?

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.620
Don't let Hopgood see
what you're doing.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.660
Keep your nose clean.
This is dangerous.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.620
I've got something of interest.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:24.100
I just passed an illegal fence
on my property,

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:25.780
and I'm on my way to discuss it.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.660
Oh, you're talking about
the pre-existing heritage path

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:32.020
leading to my historical boundary.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.900
I suppose you're going to charge me
with trespass now?

01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:40.500
I certainly reserve the right to.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.100
Some day-old plunger coffee? I can
reheat it if you want. Like a bickie?

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:54.540
If they're my only options.
Put a bit of rum in it for you.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:58.020
Oh, yeah, that might bring
the feeling back to my hands.

01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.500
Just a puddle.

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.260
And what room do you call this?
This is the ballroom.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.700
I'm not apologising for my place.
It's a ruin.

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:16.020
I'm waiting for another ruin
to be built.

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:20.380
And let me guess, this is where
you go to after the ball?

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:25.500
That's the withdrawing room.
It's where we withdraw.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.500
Cheers.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:33.820
Mm, wow.
No half measures here.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.260
Ah, hello.

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.500
I'm not here to grill you, Joe.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.740
It just seems like the government
are happy to let this business die.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:47.700
Oh, there's no politics
about homicide.

01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.860
I think we're just waiting
for things to calm down.

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:53.420
This is the Daunt.
It's not going to cool down.

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.700
Do you at least accept
the possibility

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.100
that those boys
didn't attack Bourgoyne?

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.020
Yes, it's possible.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:07.540
I heard that you tried to call off
the chase, but Hopgood ignored you.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.260
Oh, Helen, that's police business.
I can't...

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:12.820
They say Hopgood is a killer.
Who's they? The Greek chorus?

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.180
You've got family in the Daunt...

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:18.580
The people I'm related to see me
as another white maggot cop.

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:20.620
That's something
you wouldn't understand.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.540
Maybe not. But people say
that Luke Walshe was executed.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:29.660
You were there. Was he?

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:37.740
Corey Pascoe's sister Suzie
said that her brother had a watch,

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:43.500
an expensive watch,
given to him over a year ago.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.900
Jesus, Joe, these kids were killed
over a bloody watch.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:51.340
What if there was two of them?

01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.860
What if Corey was just going
to Sydney to sell his watch?

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:01.740
Do you cops ever think about justice
or can you just do no wrong?

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.020
Cops are just like lawyers,
only they don't get rich,

01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.540
and people try to kill them.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:10.420
I... I just can't seem
to get this right with you...

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.420
Remind me when you ever tried?

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:17.020
You came over here screaming
blue murder about a piece of land

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.820
that I would have come
to some agreement with you over.

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:22.140
Now you're trying to tell me
how to do my job.

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.580
Are you interested in the truth?

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:28.940
The truth?
Or the truth that suits you?

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.380
Thanks for the coffee.
I'll find my own way out.

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:41.060
No, I want to be a witness
to any alleged falls.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.060
Think you can set up a meeting
with Suzie Pascoe?

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:50.340
Away from the station?

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:59.420
I came back here to...
Because I needed some quiet.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.580
I'd forgotten how unsettling
quiet actually is.

01:06:12.640 --> 01:06:17.860
Sorry, that was just an impulse.
Not a sane one.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.340
Stop watching me.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:41.700
Abalone gone missing
from down your way, has it?

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:46.300
Worse. Truckload of beer. We think
someone from here flogged it.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:48.660
Hundred percent certainty, I'd say.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:52.660
Well, these files are ancient.
Should try the modern era.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:23.100
Suzie, this is Detective Cashin.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.420
He's big and he's ugly,
but maybe he can help.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:28.900
G'day, Suzie.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.900
Corey had a watch before Sydney.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.620
Long before the old bloke died.
He showed it to me.

01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:44.900
Did he say how he got it?

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:48.140
Just that it was a present
from someone.

01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:52.540
It's a big present.
Do you know who gave it to him?

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:03.340
Maybe... Ray Piggott.
Ray Piggott. I know Ray.

01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.460
So you're saying
he traded weed for the watch?

01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.820
It's alright. You're not
in any trouble, I promise.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.819
People grow a bit of weed
around here.

01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:20.620
Make a few bucks. Not much work.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.380
How else they gonna make it?
Sure.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.859
Do you remember
what brand the watch was?

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:36.300
Nuh. It started with a 'br'...
I don't know.

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:38.340
Is that it?

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:41.700
No, that's not it.
That has a white face.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.500
Corey's had a black one,
with all these little clock things.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.340
Thanks, Suzie.

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.340
Is that it?
Mm-hm.

01:09:23.439 --> 01:09:28.979
That's barely a report. Three deaths.
Bare minimum report. Three deaths.

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:38.100
The Moral Companions camp
was for boys, orphans and the like.

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:40.939
Gave them a holiday, bit of fun.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.620
And this fire in '83, that put
an end to everything, didn't it?

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.859
Mm.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.740
Any idea where they kept their
records? Names of staff, kids' names?

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.020
I had nothing to do with it.
Charles kept them separately.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.420
In this book, though,
it says he transferred two grand

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.500
to the same Companions account
every month.

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.220
There's no details here.
What's that about?

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.700
May I?

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.460
There's another two payments here,
$200,000 each.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.500
What's that, 30 years ago?

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:16.100
There's no name.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:20.300
It'll be some other charity
he was supporting at the time.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.020
Yes, it's very likely.
But I need to see some bank details.

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:25.820
Confidential, I'm afraid.

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:29.580
No such thing in a murder case,
Cecily. Excuse me. Yeah?

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.540
Yeah, mate,
the kid's story checks out.

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.340
Bourgoyne did buy two Branlaus

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.820
from a shop called Cozzens
on Collins Street.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:40.580
Yeah, one black face, one white.
He knew them well.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.020
Shit. I don't suppose any idiot
thought to ask the Sydney pawnbroker

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:45.500
for a description of the bloody
watch.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:50.420
Apparently not.
Ah, fuck it! Alright, thanks.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.940
I saw you on the telly the other
night. You were being rude then too.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:59.780
I need to work on my media skills,
yes.

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:03.140
Nothing on the two big cheques.
Might be in his tax files.

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:07.580
But I do have an address
on the monthly payment.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.740
It's in North Melbourne
somewhere.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.180
'Moral Companions'.

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.740
Pollard. Arthur.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.300
So they tied someone down here
and made 'em watch?

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.220
What's his connection
with Bourgoyne?

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.660
This place was
on Bourgoyne's payroll.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:44.620
And the vinegar. I could smell it
at Bourgoyne's place that morning.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.260
Glad to see you dropped the case.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.260
'They gave me gall to eat,

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:53.300
and when I was thirsty,
gave me vinegar to drink.'

01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.220
What?
The Book of Common Prayer. A psalm.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:00.580
Baptist education
for little Aboriginal boys.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:08.220
Well, your corpse had form.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.980
Used to work at an orphanage
until he was given the boot.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.460
What the hell?
Let me guess.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:39.340
Oklahoma? Kiss Me Kate?

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.460
Let's run a check
on the names of the boys

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:16.420
listed as state orphans
around these dates.

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.140
You always in pain?

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.820
Oh, it's mainly when you're around.
I'll ignore that.

01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:02.940
How'd you go in the city?
I know you won't tell me.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.420
Police business.
But I know you haven't given up.

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:08.820
Now, you now have
a lovely new neighbour

01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:12.340
who would like to invite you
to her house for a drink.

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.060
And maybe microwave some party pies.
Party pies. Wow.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:22.980
Yes, I'm told that people
in your circle quite enjoy them.

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:29.420
I'll follow you? That way you won't
be
able to give me a speeding ticket.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:36.140
I know.
I'm living in an Emily Bronte novel.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.060
I haven't committed
to furniture yet.

01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:43.980
It's just a fridge and a stove
and microwave.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.460
No personality.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:49.140
Well, party pies are perfect, then.

01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.940
Very little personality
in a party pie.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.900
Did you inherit those eyes?

01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:03.820
Yeah, one from each parent.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.620
If you, um, if you look closely,
they're not quite the same.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.780
Oh, I know your eyes.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:16.940
You were a person of interest
at school.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.220
Do you feel the need to talk to me
in cop-speak? Yeah.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:26.580
You never noticed me.
I did. You were always glowering.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:32.020
There's something sexy
about a glower. You still glower.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:36.020
What's a glower?
Don't question your gift.

01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:02.660
Are cops always this intimate
on a first date?

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.540
Cops generally
don't have second dates.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:19.380
Helen, I'm... I'm not... really...

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:24.740
Talkative? In the mood?

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.060
What aren't you, really?

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.620
You don't want to stay
and have some party pies? Yeah.

01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.020
I'm fucked.

01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.600
What, and I'm not?

01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:44.300
I mean, my back, and my legs.

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:51.180
Everything.
Oh, you mean really fucked?

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.820
That's OK.

01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.780
Show me.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:15.980
Wow.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.300
Nasty.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:27.700
Maybe you should have followed
your brother into architecture.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.180
Yeah.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:53.060
I was with Bobby for six years.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:55.940
He couldn't even make it
to the seven-year itch.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.540
He may be a beacon of hope
for all of Australia,

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.860
but as a boyfriend,
he was a terrible root rat.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:09.620
So I had a meltdown, came here.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:13.580
Bobby Walshe's electorate.
Strange place to escape to.

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.060
Oh, it's a place.

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:20.540
It's winter. Spring's coming.

01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:24.900
You know there won't be
a single person in Monro

01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:26.540
who doesn't know
we've done it by now.

01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.500
Oh, they need something
to cheer them up.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:29.980
Cheered me up.

01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.780
Good.

01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.540
How's your back
hard up against a tree?

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:52.100
I'm happy to give it a shot...
if the tree's willing.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:20:58.740
G'day, Bruce.

01:21:03.440 --> 01:21:07.380
You head inside now, Tay.
Mum's got spag bol for dinner.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.860
Spag bol? Mum's got spag bol?
Do you want some?

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.020
No, thanks, Tay.
Alright.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.740
I understand you drove
Mr Bourgoyne around.

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:22.780
Ever take him to this place?
Nah.

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.140
Yeah.

01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:30.780
And when you did...
did you ever see this guy?

01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:36.140
Is there something wrong
with your brain? I said no...

01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:39.420
You know, a serious brain problem
would be bullshitting me.

01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:41.980
I'm calling Hopgood.
He's a mate of mine.

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.700
I'll drive you to the station.
You can ring him from there.

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:49.860
You know what they did, don't ya?
They fucked boys.

01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:54.340
Boys your son's age. Younger.
He wasn't one, was he?

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.700
How would your son like to know

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.700
that his dad was a chauffeur
for a kiddie fiddler?

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.220
You shut your mouth.

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:05.940
You don't say anything
or I'll fuckin' kill ya.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.140
Now, I never saw nothin'.
No, you just ran errands for 'em.

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.300
When was the last time
you were there?

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:15.580
Just before Bourgoyne died.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:22.100
Wanted me to pick up a heap of files
from Pollard and then burn 'em all.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.700
Don't go anywhere, Bruce.

01:22:24.760 --> 01:22:27.100
If I find out you went running back
to your buddy Hopgood,

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.620
I'll come back here and I'll arrest
you as an accessory. You understand?

01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.700
I love my boy.
And I never touched no boy.

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:42.980
You hear me? The lot of them,
they made me fuckin' sick.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:48.540
Yeah.
And I never did burn those files.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:59.540
Robin Bonney, Charles Bourgoyne,
Percy Crake and Duncan Ballins.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:05.740
Got a Robin Gray Bonney here.
Age 67.

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:07.620
Possibility?
That's about right.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.420
A sex offender.

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.500
Suspended on two charges
and then he did four out of six.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:21.540
He's dead. Multiple stab wounds,
castrated, mutilated and strangled.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:25.100
When?
Three weeks ago in Sydney.

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.500
Anything on Crake?

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.380
He died six months ago.
Yeah?

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.740
Natural causes. Hit by a bus.
Doesn't get more natural than that.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.220
Unless someone pushed you.

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:47.180
Dave Rebb?

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.860
Dave!

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.740
Rebb!

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.060
Dave.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:08.140
Rebb!

01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:15.580
Yeah?

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:21.700
The two cheques, $200,000 each
paid out in '83, '84.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.100
Took forever, thank you very much.
Had to dig out the old tax records.

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:28.740
The recipient was a company
wound down in '84.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:35.020
Name of Begone Begone Pty Ltd.

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:38.100
Registered under the name
of Derek Singleton.

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.940
This guy was one of 
the kids in the video.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.780
He went on two Companions camps.
He has a few personal issues now.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.660
Thrashed me all the time.

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:07.220
All of 'em did. Make me do things.
Who're you talking about?

01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:10.180
He made me read the Bible,
then pull his cock out.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:14.300
He broke three of me ribs. Made me
tell the school I fell off me bike.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:19.020
I never had no bike.
Always wanted one. I never had one.

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.260
He even did it to his own son.

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:26.420
Loaned him out to his mates.
His own son! His own f... son.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.980
Don't gimme that look! I know that
look! I had that fuckin' look!

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.860
I had that look me whole life.
You gimme that fuckin' look again...

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:36.420
Steady on.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:41.540
Detective Dove here tells me
you might have some idea

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.140
who committed these murders.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:47.140
I told you. His son, Jamie.
Jamie Bourgoyne?

01:25:48.680 --> 01:25:51.980
He's dead, mate.
He drowned in Tasmania in 1993.

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.740
Risen from the dead. I seen him.
He come back to make it right.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.620
In Nicholson Street, in the hostel.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:03.660
Jamie and his bum buddy, Justin.
Mate, don't fuck with Justin.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:07.340
It's been over 30 years.
You sure it was them?

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:12.420
I know Jamie.
I know Justin, alright?

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:15.500
Dark, curly hair. A funny lip.

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:20.660
Crazy eyes, blue eyes. He's crazy,
mate, crazy. Crazier than me.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.540
Don't you play 
these games with me.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:37.460
Don't you drag me here
on the word of some junkie. Do not.

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.420
I thought this might be convenient
for you. I figured you knew the
place.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:42.900
Take a seat.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.700
There's really no point
in going on with this.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.340
Your brother's alive, isn't he?
That's why you hired a bodyguard.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:54.180
Look, you've got no idea...
Your stepfather was a monster.

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:59.020
The only way your brother could
survive was by faking his own death.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:01.980
He forced you to come here and watch,
didn't he?

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.740
No. He's dead.

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:15.540
What was it like
after your mother's accident?

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:20.100
It was just the two of you,
alone in that house, with Charles.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:24.380
What happened after school?
What happened at night?

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:26.820
Was your mother's death an accident?

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:32.180
The same night those three boys died,
she... what, she tripped?

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:34.060
Fell down the stairs?
You must have suspicions.

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:36.900
What does this matter?
What does any of this matter now?

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.140
What'd you see that night?
Look, I don't know.

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.180
I don't know. I don't remember.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:44.500
All I know is that depraved,
sick bastard is dead,

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:48.340
and so are all his sweaty,
grunting friends.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.940
And so maybe now we can sleep.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.820
But you sat here, in this seat,
and you were part of this.

01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:56.420
Right from the start, you knew
exactly how this was going to end.

01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:58.740
No. You sat here
and you watched them torture Pollard.

01:27:58.800 --> 01:28:00.580
How'd that make you feel? Did you...

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.180
Did you clap
when the curtain came down?

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.900
These men that you are so keen
to protect,

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.340
do you realise how many children
went through that terrible place?

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:14.940
Do you realise how many lives
that... that...

01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:18.820
And what were you going to do
with them, Detective?

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:22.620
I'd arrest them.
Let the courts decide.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.700
I'm sorry,
that's just not good enough.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.940
Not by a long shot.

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:33.380
You had nothing to do with the sale
of the Companions camp, did you?

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:37.260
I checked. You didn't come back
into town to sell any land.

01:28:39.040 --> 01:28:42.340
Three days before your stepfather's
death, you came back to warn him.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:46.260
Did I?
Did you warn him?

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.820
I was gonna warn him but then I...

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.860
..then I saw his face
and I remembered.

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:57.220
I remembered this... I remembered
my little brother and...

01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:04.020
..how I couldn't protect him
and that no-one came to save us.

01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:07.340
And... So I didn't warn him.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.420
Where's your brother?
I don't know where he is.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:13.660
And if I did know,
I wouldn't tell you.

01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:18.980
'Cause I-I know they'll stop
when it's finally over.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.380
We'll be in touch.

01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:26.460
Do you think because you care now,

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:29.900
do you think because there's all
this compensation from the church

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.860
and Royal Commissions,
do you think that all this pain

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:36.140
and this damage
just magically disappears?

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.940
No, I didn't clap
because they dragged me here,

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.380
and they tied me to that chair
and they taped my mouth shut.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:44.700
But if they didn't,
I probably would have cheered.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:57.660
Got an address for Duncan Ballins.
He's the last one left.

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:01.140
Coburg. St Aidan's. An ex-seminary.

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:06.340
Are we really sure
we want to protect this prick?

01:30:17.680 --> 01:30:20.060
Armed?
A bit.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.260
It's just one old priest,
not the Hell's Angels.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.820
I'll go the front. You go around
the back in case he bolts.

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:33.220
Who is it?
What do you want?

01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.100
Detective Sergeant
Joe Cashin. -Homicide.

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.060
You're a bit of a hermit here,
aren't you?

01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:07.260
Long time since the glory days

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.260
when you got to help the boys
in the shower.

01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:13.620
Your old chums
from the Companions camp,

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.460
presumably you've heard
they're at rest?

01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:20.380
Though I doubt at peace.
There's nothing I have to tell you.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:23.780
You know they were all tortured,
killed.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:25.980
Unless you've got a warrant,
you know the way out.

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:27.940
Robin's was particularly awful.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:33.900
Some sort of colonoscopy,
an appliance heated over a gas ring.

01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:41.620
Don't move.

01:31:47.040 --> 01:31:49.060
Dove? You alright?

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.580
Dove!

01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:24.340
Dove, where are ya?

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.060
Help me... please.

01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:40.540
Please...

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:44.340
Help me! Please forgive me!

01:32:48.280 --> 01:32:50.940
Help me. Help me, please.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.820
Joe.
Dove?

01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.300
Joe!
Dove?

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.740
Joe...

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.780
Fuck me.
Joe.

01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:11.580
Please don't do this.

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.100
Help me. Please, help me!

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.500
Please.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.700
Drop your weapon.
Put the gun down, Jamie.

01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:25.180
No!

01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:24.700
'I am he that liveth and was dead,
and behold I am alive forever more.

01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:27.860
Suffer the little children
to come unto me.'

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.860
Our Lord said that,
didn't he, Duncan?

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.660
But you know that already.

01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.940
And those three boys that
you and my father went too far with,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:42.740
the ones you had to burn
to cover your sins...

01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:46.020
..what mercy did you show them?

01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:54.700
Father, forgive me
my sins. I am in thy light.

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.180
Forgive me.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:03.500
'And in those days shall men seek
death and shall not find it,

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.860
and they shall desire to die.'

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.300
I told a cop 30 years ago.
I told him everything.

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.340
Pleaded with him to save us boys.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.140
You know what that cop did?

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:16.540
Huh?

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.700
Nothin'.

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.980
He was the last of them.

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.820
We done what we set out to do.

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:42.740
It's time to make peace
with the Father.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.740
Give us this day our daily
bread and forgive us our trespasses

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.540
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:15.340
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil, amen.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.140
Amen.

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:21.220
We say farewell to a great cop,
a great detective

01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:24.260
and a great man who died too early.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.980
Vale Detective Inspector
Derek Singleton.

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:41.420
By the way, you were right.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:45.300
Singo's company,
he was paid to turn his head.

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.460
200,000 bucks within three days
after the Cromarty fire.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.900
And then two days after the inquest,
another 200,000 went in.

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.620
It's like two fucking deaths.

01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:02.660
Mate, he was like a parrot
on your shoulder the whole time.

01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.300
'Go the extra mile,
follow all your leads.'

01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.020
Unbelievable.

01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.020
You know we were mentioned
in the will?

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:14.780
Oh, the Salvos can have my share.

01:38:17.040 --> 01:38:20.660
This man has blood with
the clotting power of a lobster.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:23.060
You two have to be
the luckiest blokes on earth.

01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:26.540
Yeah, if I was so lucky, would never
have met you two in the first place.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.260
That's actually a good point.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:31.020
So what happened to Hopgood?
Shifted laterally.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:34.780
Desert country, I think.
We'll get him in the end.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.180
We just have to prove he was
on the old bastard's payroll.

01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:40.260
Yeah. Alright, I'm off.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:43.540
Some dickhead stole two frozen
chickens from the local supermarket,

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:45.060
so it's all hands on deck.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:52.020
Then you're coming back, OK?

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:59.940
OK? I'm not joking.
You're coming back!

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.860
Thought you'd gone walkabout.
Rostered days off.

01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:38.500
I saw a photo of the Companions camp
footy team from 1981.

01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:42.380
There's a kid the spitting image
of you, played half-forward flank.

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.820
Nah. Never was a kid.

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.260
The, ah, the gate's my idea.

01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:01.980
Thought we might need quick access
on the odd cold, dark night.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.620
But I put the bolt on my side.

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:12.940
So... speaking to him,
not speaking to him.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.860
Speaks, no speaks.

01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.380
You up for a walk?
Yeah, sure.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:32.460
As long as we can go past that tree.

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:06.140
'More broken than you are.'

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.340
A funerary urn.

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:52.020
Jesus, Joe, is Blue Balls on
a different time zone or something?

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.420
Mate, I need Trace to put together
a list of missing kids

01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:01.340
from the following years -
'78, '81, '88, '89...

01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:06.700
Alright, I will get her to call you
during normal, sane business hours.

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.780
There's no end to it for you,
is there?

01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.060
Not in this lifetime, mate.
Not in this lifetime.
