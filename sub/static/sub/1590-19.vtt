10:53.120 --> 10:55.020
This is my fifth
birthday party.

10:56.355 --> 10:59.290
<i>I decided to make</i>
<i>a grand entrance.</i>

10:59.292 --> 11:02.060
<i>I made myself all beautiful,</i>
<i>just like my big sister.</i>

11:03.996 --> 11:06.865
Finally I was perfect, and
then went to the stairs

11:06.867 --> 11:09.067
To enter like the
belle of the ball.

11:09.069 --> 11:10.935
<i>When I finally came</i>
<i>out of my room,</i>

11:10.937 --> 11:12.904
<i>I found the party</i>
<i>going on without me.</i>

11:12.906 --> 11:15.440
<i>(cheers and laughing)</i>

11:15.442 --> 11:17.442
And I kept posing at
the top of the stairs,

11:17.444 --> 11:20.378
Waiting to be noticed,
but all I heard was...

11:20.380 --> 11:23.014
These party favors
are the coolest.

have the whole story.

one of her parties
