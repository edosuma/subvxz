00:05.737 --> 00:11.448
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.

00:13.377 --> 00:16.687
That creature is us.

00:17.897 --> 00:24.450
All over the world, we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,

00:24.497 --> 00:30.174
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.

00:31.497 --> 00:34.853
This is the Human Planet.

00:44.577 --> 00:48.252
Humans have always been drawn to rivers.

00:52.497 --> 00:54.692
Rivers flow through every environment,

00:54.737 --> 00:58.855
bringing us the essentials of life -

00:58.897 --> 01:01.331
fresh water...

01:02.537 --> 01:04.414
...food...

01:06.457 --> 01:09.210
...and ready-made highways.

01:10.937 --> 01:15.613
But what rivers give,
they can also take away.

01:15.657 --> 01:17.648
They can flood,

01:17.697 --> 01:20.165
freeze

01:20.217 --> 01:23.687
and sometimes disappear altogether.

01:26.217 --> 01:30.335
Rivers force us to take great risks.

01:30.377 --> 01:33.972
These are remarkable stories of survival

01:34.017 --> 01:38.215
from the most unpredictable habitat
of them all.

02:04.097 --> 02:07.567
It's the monsoon season,
and the mighty Mekong,

02:07.617 --> 02:11.326
Southeast Asia's greatest river,
is in full flood.

02:13.777 --> 02:16.814
Between Cambodia and Laos,

02:16.857 --> 02:21.373
the Mekong current creates
the widest rapids in the world.

02:32.257 --> 02:35.533
The Khone Falls are great for fishing,
but also very dangerous...

02:37.217 --> 02:40.653
...as Sam Niang, a local fisherman,
knows all too well.

03:09.177 --> 03:13.728
Migrating fish get trapped here,
waiting to get up the rapids.

03:18.897 --> 03:22.526
Sam Niang has to risk his life
to catch them.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.137
He has a family of seven to feed.

03:27.257 --> 03:30.852
He starts by fishing from the riverside,
near his home.

03:37.217 --> 03:42.974
During the monsoon, the Mekong
swells to 20 times its normal volume,

03:43.017 --> 03:47.374
which brings more fish,
but makes them much harder to catch.

04:05.457 --> 04:08.096
After a morning, his net is still empty.

04:10.737 --> 04:15.367
There is another option -
an island out in the main rapids.

04:16.617 --> 04:21.088
But to get there, Sam Niang
must take his life into his hands.

04:34.137 --> 04:37.686
In the dry season, he built
a high wire across the rapids

04:37.737 --> 04:40.046
out of old cable and bits of rope.

05:02.257 --> 05:04.248
At this time of the year,

05:04.297 --> 05:09.325
these rapids have nearly
twice the flow of Niagara Falls -

05:09.377 --> 05:12.449
more than 11 million litres a second.

06:03.377 --> 06:07.131
He makes it to his favourite
fishing perch.

06:17.497 --> 06:19.931
Turbulent currents corral the fish,

06:19.977 --> 06:23.049
and Sam Niang soon lands
his family's supper.

06:26.377 --> 06:28.971
Though the fish are plentiful here,

06:29.017 --> 06:32.248
the most he can carry back
is a few kilos at a time.

06:37.257 --> 06:40.613
Any more,
and he might lose his balance.

07:00.017 --> 07:04.295
Today, Sam Niang won his battle
with the Mekong.

07:04.337 --> 07:09.411
Tomorrow, to keep his family fed,
he'll have to fight it again.

07:13.737 --> 07:17.969
It's not just the power of water
that makes rivers dangerous.

07:19.217 --> 07:21.856
It's their erratic nature too.

07:24.297 --> 07:26.174
Reading a river correctly

07:26.217 --> 07:29.766
can mean the difference
between life and death.

07:31.337 --> 07:36.491
The Zanskar valley is a hidden world
on the edge of Tibet,

07:36.537 --> 07:38.926
in the heart of the Himalayas.

07:38.977 --> 07:42.765
In winter, it's cut off by snow.

07:42.817 --> 07:45.536
All roads in and out are impassable.

07:53.577 --> 07:57.286
Stanzin needs to get
his two children to school,

07:57.337 --> 08:01.376
but the nearest school
is 1 00 kilometres away,

08:01.417 --> 08:03.726
and the only way to get there

08:03.777 --> 08:06.689
is to walk down a frozen river.

08:10.537 --> 08:15.975
It's a six-day trek,
so dangerous it's got its own name -

08:16.017 --> 08:19.054
the Chadar - the blanket of ice.

08:21.577 --> 08:25.092
They'll have to brave
sub-zero temperatures,

08:25.137 --> 08:27.287
avalanches and freezing water.

08:31.857 --> 08:34.530
Term starts in a week.

08:34.577 --> 08:39.332
It's time for the school run,
a formidable trip for 11-year-old Dolkar.

08:46.737 --> 08:51.015
Dolkar's 1 4-year-old brother,
Chosing, is coming too.

08:55.297 --> 08:58.175
The family prepare for the journey ahead.

09:03.177 --> 09:07.534
Their mother has knitted them
thick woollen socks to protect them.

09:33.137 --> 09:37.096
The brother and sister depend
on their father's courage and skill.

09:48.777 --> 09:53.532
This has to be the most perilous
school run in the world.

10:16.457 --> 10:22.646
The spring melt seems to have
started early, which worries Stanzin.

10:57.057 --> 11:01.096
Stanzin has to make sure
the ice can take their weight.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.090
And his expertise is tested immediately.

11:31.617 --> 11:37.453
The danger is not only underfoot.
There's another threat - avalanches.

11:53.697 --> 11:58.452
Seven days ago, an avalanche
killed a man on the Zanskar river.

12:14.417 --> 12:19.172
The unusual spring sunshine
has brought another problem.

12:19.217 --> 12:22.607
The river's current
has already melted the ice.

12:29.577 --> 12:32.967
Stanzin has to find a way
past the barrier.

12:47.617 --> 12:51.212
The only way around is a narrow ledge.

13:07.017 --> 13:11.010
The ledge is barely 20 centimetres wide
and covered with snow.

13:13.937 --> 13:18.328
There's a ten-metre drop
to the freezing river below.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.931
The ledge ends with some metal pegs
to climb down.

13:28.537 --> 13:31.005
Chosing makes it.

13:31.057 --> 13:33.013
Now it's Dolkar's turn.

14:43.857 --> 14:45.415
They mustn't delay.

14:46.777 --> 14:52.249
Night is falling fast, and the temperature
will plummet to minus 30 Celsius.

14:52.297 --> 14:56.336
Luckily, Stanzin knows a cave nearby.

15:20.177 --> 15:22.407
The children need their sleep.

15:22.457 --> 15:26.211
The most dangerous part of the Chadar
is still ahead.

15:35.777 --> 15:37.654
It's not all hard slog.

15:39.857 --> 15:43.566
But Dolkar's fun can't last.

15:43.617 --> 15:48.054
As the smallest,
she's the first to feel the cold.

15:48.097 --> 15:52.249
She starts to lag behind.

15:52.297 --> 15:56.051
One little girl on a melting ice river,

15:56.097 --> 15:59.294
among the greatest mountains on Earth.

16:21.697 --> 16:23.813
Now for the final leg.

16:45.017 --> 16:48.327
The melting ice
has left just a tiny shelf.

17:03.977 --> 17:07.890
It's thin. Stanzin is worried
it won't take their weight.

17:15.257 --> 17:18.135
As he advances, the ice starts to crack.

17:35.897 --> 17:39.333
With the ice weakened
by Stanzin's weight,

17:39.377 --> 17:42.733
the children
have to brave it on their own.

18:25.817 --> 18:29.173
Dolkar's made it, now for Chosing.

18:40.617 --> 18:45.691
Thanks to their dad's expertise,
the children have survived the Chadar.

18:45.737 --> 18:48.376
Six days out on the ice river.

18:51.817 --> 18:56.891
The Himalayan town of Leh,
journey's end for the children.

18:56.937 --> 18:59.053
They rush straight to the school.

18:59.097 --> 19:02.214
There's just enough time for a goodbye.

19:37.017 --> 19:41.215
Stanzin now faces the return journey
on his own.

19:44.537 --> 19:49.292
Melting river ice
doesn't just make travelling harder.

19:49.337 --> 19:54.092
When frozen rivers break up,
tonnes of ice start to flow,

19:54.137 --> 19:58.653
a potential disaster,
even in the heart of a modern city.

19:59.857 --> 20:02.576
In the Canadian capital, Ottawa,

20:02.617 --> 20:08.089
spring melt turns the Rideau river
into public enemy number one.

20:08.137 --> 20:12.369
The danger point is a footbridge
on a frozen waterfall...

20:13.977 --> 20:17.890
...a bottleneck where the Rideau
flows into the Ottawa river.

20:24.977 --> 20:29.175
It's late February,
and the ice is melting here too.

20:29.217 --> 20:31.412
Ice blocks are in danger
of forming a dam,

20:31.457 --> 20:34.290
which might lead to devastating flooding.

20:36.097 --> 20:40.295
A natural threat
that needs a daring human solution.

20:44.497 --> 20:47.455
Meet the ice-dam busters!

20:50.857 --> 20:53.576
Theirjob isn't just to predict nature,

20:53.617 --> 20:56.177
they have to beat it!

21:02.977 --> 21:08.449
There are thousands of tonnes of ice
behind the bridge, up to a metre thick.

21:08.497 --> 21:11.694
The team needs to break it up
to keep the river flowing.

21:14.457 --> 21:19.087
Stage one - cut the ice into long strips.

21:19.137 --> 21:24.131
They're still too large to flow
under the bridge, so, for stage two,

21:24.177 --> 21:28.216
the team uses a more persuasive force...

21:29.897 --> 21:31.296
Now!

21:31.337 --> 21:34.215
...hundreds of kilos of dynamite.

21:41.657 --> 21:43.136
Hup!

22:18.217 --> 22:24.213
Bite-size pieces now flow easily
under the bridge and over the falls.

22:24.257 --> 22:28.489
The centre of Ottawa
is safe for another year.

22:30.177 --> 22:35.649
The world's largest rivers
bring the most danger to our lives.

22:36.697 --> 22:38.767
Their floods can be devastating.

22:41.217 --> 22:43.253
They often happen without warning,

22:43.297 --> 22:46.016
and there's nothing we can do
but try to escape.

22:47.577 --> 22:50.853
In Bangladesh,
tens of millions of people

22:50.897 --> 22:56.335
can be displaced when the Ganges
and her tributaries burst their banks.

22:59.297 --> 23:04.496
The river is so strong,
it regularly changes course,

23:04.537 --> 23:06.334
brushing land aside as it goes.

23:13.457 --> 23:18.087
A month ago, Mohamed Jaleel's village
was 1 00 metres from the bank.

23:18.137 --> 23:22.210
Today, his house
is about to be swept away.

23:29.577 --> 23:33.456
He and his neighbours have only minutes
to move his home.

23:50.737 --> 23:54.412
The rest of the villagers look on,
helpless,

23:54.457 --> 23:57.767
as the rising river
obliterates their land.

24:24.977 --> 24:29.016
In South America, floods can be so huge

24:29.057 --> 24:32.447
that the entire year
has to be spent planning for them.

24:37.737 --> 24:43.130
In the Amazon basin, one mother
prepares for the rising waters.

24:43.177 --> 24:47.534
Jarnia lives by the Rio Negro in Brazil.

24:48.617 --> 24:53.088
It's November, the dry season,
the time of plenty.

24:56.297 --> 24:58.765
Fish are so easy to catch,

24:58.817 --> 25:02.492
she even has enough
to feed the local river dolphins.

25:09.457 --> 25:12.972
But in six months'time,
when the flood water invades,

25:13.017 --> 25:15.770
all these dolphins and the fish with them

25:15.817 --> 25:19.412
will disappear into the flooded forest
to breed.

25:26.177 --> 25:30.807
When the fish are gone, feeding
her large family will become a nightmare.

25:35.377 --> 25:39.165
Surviving such hard times
means thinking ahead,

25:39.217 --> 25:41.856
and Jarnia has a four-stage plan.

25:44.777 --> 25:50.488
Stage one is collecting turtle eggs
six months before the floods arrive.

26:01.257 --> 26:05.136
River turtles lay thousands of eggs
in the dry season beaches,

26:05.177 --> 26:08.089
which they leave to hatch.

26:08.137 --> 26:13.973
Turtles are a reliable source of protein
when the waters rise,

26:14.017 --> 26:16.770
so these eggs are precious.

26:31.697 --> 26:35.372
Back in the village,
it's time for stage two.

26:38.577 --> 26:43.253
Jarnia reburies the eggs
in her turtle nursery.

26:43.297 --> 26:45.936
In the wild,
many eggs would be eaten by animals...

26:47.497 --> 26:49.294
...but here they'll be safe.

26:59.377 --> 27:03.006
By March, four months later,
3,000 eggs have hatched.

27:04.097 --> 27:06.770
It's stage three - release day!

27:32.537 --> 27:34.334
It's time to release the babies.

27:37.457 --> 27:42.008
But will enough of them survive
to feed the village in the floods to come?

27:46.577 --> 27:49.137
It's June, the height of the rains.

27:53.657 --> 27:56.410
The river rises seven metres.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.935
Jarnia's village is transformed.

28:04.777 --> 28:06.449
The forest is flooded,

28:06.497 --> 28:11.048
and the nearest dry land
is more than six hours'rowing away.

28:13.457 --> 28:19.646
Jarnia's family is now marooned by
the greatest annual flood on the planet.

28:26.137 --> 28:29.095
Time for the final stage.

28:29.137 --> 28:33.892
Jarnia and her sister Dora
prepare to go turtle-hunting.

28:33.937 --> 28:39.216
Jarnia's husband, Francisco,
makes them a turtle-hunting spear...

28:48.337 --> 28:52.296
...and then the two sisters set off
in search of food.

29:00.097 --> 29:03.214
Will their hard work
bring dinner to the table?

29:12.937 --> 29:16.134
At first, it's not looking promising.

29:33.497 --> 29:36.489
Then Jarnia spots one.

29:54.697 --> 29:57.006
Her preparation's paid off.

29:57.057 --> 29:59.491
She'll be able to feed everyone.

30:09.097 --> 30:13.693
Jarnia's foresight has pulled her family
through another difficult flood.

30:45.737 --> 30:50.253
Some river creatures
pose a direct threat to humans.

30:52.857 --> 31:00.286
The Zambezi river in Africa is used
by elephants, crocodiles and hippos,

31:00.337 --> 31:03.647
some of the continent's
most dangerous animals.

31:07.977 --> 31:10.775
Fisherman Josphat and his brothers
have found a safe,

31:10.817 --> 31:14.127
if slightly hair-raising, fishing spot,

31:14.177 --> 31:18.329
a place where they can catch lunch
without becoming dinner themselves.

31:41.977 --> 31:45.287
The place they're heading for
may be safe from crocodiles,

31:45.337 --> 31:48.090
but it does have a drawback.

32:08.297 --> 32:12.210
The reason Josphat's fishing pools
are far from safe

32:12.257 --> 32:14.771
is their precarious position...

32:38.697 --> 32:41.769
...at the very top of Victoria Falls.

33:00.777 --> 33:02.927
Josphat's bravery and skill

33:02.977 --> 33:06.970
enable him to fish
where no animal dares to venture.

33:31.777 --> 33:37.807
People can overcome floods and even
learn to fish on giant waterfalls,

33:37.857 --> 33:43.011
but there's one face of a river
that's virtually impossible to survive.

33:46.617 --> 33:51.054
When a river dries up and disappears,
all life drains away.

33:55.617 --> 34:00.327
Lemagas is a Samburu camel herder
in northern Kenya.

34:00.377 --> 34:04.609
No rain has fallen here for eight months.

34:04.657 --> 34:09.208
It's a severe drought,
and the Milgis river has vanished.

34:10.777 --> 34:13.735
Lemagas has been forced to range
deep into the desert,

34:13.777 --> 34:17.087
searching for fresh food
for his precious camels.

34:19.137 --> 34:24.086
Now they are far away from home,
and they've run out of drinking water.

34:41.137 --> 34:46.336
Not even the camels can survive this long
without a drink.

34:46.377 --> 34:52.054
Lemagas knows there is water here,
hidden underneath the river bed.

34:57.977 --> 35:00.013
But how can he find it?

35:06.577 --> 35:11.697
The Samburu have learned
to rely on another nomadic creature,

35:11.737 --> 35:14.490
one that usually travels at night.

35:24.897 --> 35:27.730
While Lemagas and his camels rest,

35:27.777 --> 35:33.807
not far away, some giant water-diviners
are sniffing out the river bed.

35:42.817 --> 35:47.811
An elephant's trunk - its nose -
is far more sensitive than a human's...

35:50.337 --> 35:55.536
...which means it can tell where
the water table is closest to the surface.

36:01.377 --> 36:05.290
Elephants must drink 1 00 litres a day

36:05.337 --> 36:10.092
and can suck up
eight litres of water at a time.

36:11.817 --> 36:15.605
Having drunk,
the elephants leave before dawn.

36:21.057 --> 36:26.006
Early next morning, Lemagas and
his camels are on the elephants'trail.

37:15.497 --> 37:19.490
Even a dry river bed holds water
if you know where to look.

37:19.537 --> 37:23.655
They sing their thanks to the gods...
and the elephants.

37:39.937 --> 37:43.816
A few days later,
Lemagas finally returns to his village

37:43.857 --> 37:45.973
with its permanent deep well.

37:46.017 --> 37:49.805
He doesn't forget the help
he's been given in the wild.

37:54.057 --> 37:57.606
The first thing he does
is to bring up precious water,

37:57.657 --> 38:02.936
not just for his herd and his family,
but for his wild friends too.

38:28.937 --> 38:33.453
He doesn't forget his nocturnal
water-diviners, for without them,

38:33.497 --> 38:36.933
Lemagas and his camels
could never survive

38:36.977 --> 38:38.649
when they're far away from home.

38:46.817 --> 38:51.493
Over 4,000 kilometres away,
in Mali, another dry river,

38:51.537 --> 38:53.448
a tributary of the Niger,

38:53.497 --> 38:57.570
is forcing one man
into making a difficult decision.

38:59.297 --> 39:03.848
His name is Ouseman,
and he's a master mason in Djenne,

39:03.897 --> 39:09.017
an ancient city
made entirely of river mud.

39:15.097 --> 39:18.851
His job is to maintain the city's mosque,

39:18.897 --> 39:22.810
the biggest and oldest mud building
in the world.

39:35.897 --> 39:39.412
It's the heart of Ouseman's culture.

39:49.817 --> 39:54.447
Ouseman's problem is this -
every year the mosque needs

39:54.497 --> 39:57.489
a fresh coat of mud to protect it
before the rains arrive.

39:59.617 --> 40:04.407
Down in the dry river bed,
the mud is blended with rice husks,

40:04.497 --> 40:06.533
and then left to ferment.

40:14.657 --> 40:19.208
But this year, the mix
hasn't reached the right consistency,

40:19.257 --> 40:23.091
and now the rains are almost upon him.

40:28.017 --> 40:31.168
Dust storms are blowing in,

40:31.217 --> 40:34.971
the first signs that the wet season
is about to begin.

40:37.977 --> 40:43.005
The sacred building desperately needs
a new storm-proof skin.

40:52.137 --> 40:57.131
Two days later, Ouseman and his friend
Ibrahim return to the river.

41:20.977 --> 41:22.695
It's a big decision.

41:22.737 --> 41:26.776
Word spreads fast,
and everyone comes down to help.

41:30.017 --> 41:34.647
Everyone in Djenne has been waiting
all year for this special day.

42:26.177 --> 42:31.297
The built-in palm logs
are perches for the plasterers.

42:54.337 --> 42:59.570
The whole town mucks in
to protect the mosque for another year.

43:11.217 --> 43:15.005
There's been a mud mosque in Djenne
for 700 years...

43:16.937 --> 43:21.453
...the sacred heart of a city
fashioned from river mud.

43:45.417 --> 43:49.456
Our relationship with rivers
is never easy.

43:49.497 --> 43:52.967
Their waters can give us so much

43:53.017 --> 43:55.372
but can also take everything away.

43:55.417 --> 44:01.652
We will always be at the mercy
of their wild and unpredictable nature.

44:06.577 --> 44:13.255
But one culture has found an inspiring way
of mastering their savage rivers.

44:15.777 --> 44:20.487
In northeast India, a giant cliff
leads up into a hidden world...

44:22.377 --> 44:23.810
...Meghalaya.

44:26.337 --> 44:31.047
Nearly two kilometres high
and buffeted by monsoon storm clouds,

44:31.097 --> 44:35.090
this is possibly
the wettest place on Earth.

44:40.497 --> 44:46.493
Once, 25 metres of rain fell here
in a year, the world record.

44:48.817 --> 44:52.492
Living here poses an unusual problem,

44:52.537 --> 44:54.846
and it's not just keeping dry.

44:58.777 --> 45:03.726
Nearly all the rain falls
during the summer monsoon.

45:04.777 --> 45:09.134
Rivers switch from gentle streams
to raging torrents.

45:14.737 --> 45:21.131
They become wild and unpredictable
and almost impossible to cross.

45:30.297 --> 45:35.325
Harley and his niece Juliana
are busy cultivating a cunning solution.

45:46.097 --> 45:50.727
30 years ago,
Harley planted this strangler fig

45:50.777 --> 45:55.328
on the river's edge, and today,
he's teaching Juliana how to care for it.

45:55.377 --> 46:00.497
The fig's tangled roots help to prevent
the bank being washed away.

46:09.537 --> 46:15.373
He teaches Juliana to coax the roots
across what is now just a stream.

46:15.417 --> 46:19.205
When they reach the other side,
they'll take hold there.

46:20.777 --> 46:25.214
This is the basis of a structure
that will survive any deluge.

46:27.377 --> 46:29.254
A living bridge.

46:32.777 --> 46:37.646
It's an epic project that no man
can complete in one lifetime,

46:37.697 --> 46:42.088
so Harley is passing on
his knowledge to Juliana.

46:50.097 --> 46:54.852
Each year, Juliana will need to tend
the roots, making them stronger.

46:57.097 --> 46:59.930
If she stays and completes her bridge,

46:59.977 --> 47:03.447
it will become part of
the commuter route here,

47:03.497 --> 47:08.412
a network of dozens of living bridges
that connect the valleys of Meghalaya.

47:27.937 --> 47:31.566
Some of them are many centuries old.

47:31.617 --> 47:33.972
There are even double-deckers.

47:56.897 --> 48:02.449
With Juliana to look after it, the future
of this young bridge looks secure...

48:08.697 --> 48:13.487
...sustainable, living architecture

48:13.537 --> 48:16.734
that will live and grow for generations...

48:25.737 --> 48:29.013
...one of the very few examples
in the world

48:29.057 --> 48:34.085
where humans have come up with
a successful and natural solution,

48:34.137 --> 48:38.176
a way of working with nature

48:38.217 --> 48:43.007
to overcome the problems
a wild river can cause.

48:53.937 --> 48:58.613
For the Human Planet Rivers team,
filming on the Mekong river

48:58.657 --> 49:02.696
at the height of the monsoon
raised many challenges.

49:04.417 --> 49:10.174
Mainly, how do you capture a remarkable
event without losing your camera,

49:10.217 --> 49:14.335
your crew or your star fisherman,
Sam Niang, to the river?

49:22.017 --> 49:26.056
The Khone Falls
have more water flowing over them

49:26.097 --> 49:28.486
than any other waterfall in the world.

49:36.057 --> 49:40.733
A narrowing of the mighty Mekong river
funnels the migrating fish

49:40.777 --> 49:44.372
and provides a dangerous,
if lucrative, opportunity.

49:56.577 --> 50:00.047
The crew's here
to capture the extreme lengths

50:00.097 --> 50:03.169
that locals will go to catch fish.

50:05.177 --> 50:10.695
Sam Niang is lucky. He has access
to his own small island for fishing.

50:10.737 --> 50:15.606
But to get to his prime spot,
he must risk life and limb.

50:48.177 --> 50:52.693
To capture the spectacle
of Sam Niang's high-wire feat,

50:52.737 --> 50:55.456
the crew have chosen a gadget
that runs on wires

50:55.497 --> 51:00.332
and that controls the camera
electronically, known as a cable dolly.

51:03.257 --> 51:08.012
And the idea is, it's one of our
most exciting and sought-after shots,

51:08.057 --> 51:11.447
so we can follow someone
walking across the tightrope,

51:11.497 --> 51:17.447
so the camera moves with them and then
pulls out to reveal the angry water.

51:19.937 --> 51:24.010
But rigging such a hi-tech system
over a raging torrent

51:24.057 --> 51:28.653
is no easy feat,
and it requires a specialist rigger.

51:28.697 --> 51:33.930
We're just trying to get
the cable across for the dolly,

51:33.977 --> 51:39.005
so the local guy's just shimmied
across the wires, as he does every day.

51:43.737 --> 51:47.366
Whilst Tim works on the cables,
the rest of the team

51:47.417 --> 51:50.693
concentrate on filming the rapids
from every other angle,

51:50.737 --> 51:55.367
even shooting in the rapids themselves.

51:55.417 --> 51:59.854
I'll just go here. It won't be a long run.
It'll take two or three minutes.

51:59.897 --> 52:01.615
Mick O'Shea was the first man ever

52:01.657 --> 52:05.969
to navigate the entire Mekong,
from Tibet to southern China -

52:06.017 --> 52:09.009
just the man to capture a fish-eye view.

52:29.457 --> 52:34.451
But even he succumbs to the full force
of the Mekong in surge.

52:36.457 --> 52:41.451
His kayak is sucked under by the powerful
current and swept downstream.

52:54.377 --> 53:00.612
After a few worrying minutes,
Mick re-appears, back in control,

53:00.657 --> 53:02.488
safe but shaken.

53:24.137 --> 53:30.736
With new-found respect for the Mekong's
power, the crew stick to solid ground.

53:30.777 --> 53:34.929
Using a four-metre jib,
they follow Sam Niang

53:34.977 --> 53:39.289
as he negotiates a treacherous
rocky outcrop to cast his net.

53:39.337 --> 53:43.012
...Over and down, OK? And on... Good.

53:49.497 --> 53:52.807
By now, Tim has the rigging
ready for the dolly.

53:52.857 --> 53:54.529
Do you want this up there?

53:54.577 --> 53:56.329
There's a massive cloud come over.

53:58.097 --> 54:01.772
But no sooner than it's in place,
the heavens open.

54:01.817 --> 54:04.126
It's the last thing they need.

54:04.177 --> 54:08.250
Dolly filming stops
for technical and safety reasons.

54:37.737 --> 54:43.255
There's just a little spot of rain.
I think rain's stopping play!

54:58.697 --> 55:01.450
- Cos electronics survive the rain well
- Yeah.

55:08.217 --> 55:11.448
The next morning,
it's clear that, as feared,

55:11.497 --> 55:13.772
water has got into the electronics.

55:18.457 --> 55:20.448
So what's gone wrong with it now?

55:34.017 --> 55:36.895
So the new, modern technology
is ousted by the old-school way.

55:46.017 --> 55:50.408
I'm going to go up there now
and, um, put the camera on!

55:50.457 --> 55:52.527
Oh, my... Whoa! OK.

55:52.577 --> 55:58.095
The crew finally get the cable dolly
working, so now it's time to get creative.

56:00.257 --> 56:06.571
The light, the dolly, the safety team
and, most importantly, Sam Niang,

56:06.617 --> 56:08.494
all have to work in unison.

56:10.657 --> 56:12.136
Go!

56:16.977 --> 56:19.127
We turned it the wrong way.

56:29.457 --> 56:31.493
OK, Tim.

56:35.817 --> 56:37.853
No.

56:37.897 --> 56:39.615
Nearly, nearly.

56:39.657 --> 56:42.171
Bring it all back, yes.

56:42.217 --> 56:44.173
Go.

56:44.217 --> 56:47.971
No. Still no!

56:49.097 --> 56:52.328
Sam Niang looks really happy,
though, doesn't he?

56:52.377 --> 56:56.495
My heart's in my mouth every time
he has to go over that rope.

56:58.497 --> 57:01.853
You look really happy,
and I'm really worried!

57:04.097 --> 57:10.491
The sun breaks through the clouds,
and finally it all comes together.

57:28.937 --> 57:31.895
Yay, we've got a keeper!

57:33.457 --> 57:35.925
That's great!

57:35.977 --> 57:39.094
Thanks very much, you.

57:39.137 --> 57:40.331
Yeah!

57:40.377 --> 57:41.890
What a relief.

57:56.897 --> 58:01.607
Despite the odds,
the Human Planet team have triumphed.
