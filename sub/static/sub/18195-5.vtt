00:09.080 --> 00:10.832
Uh! Still engaged.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.552
Hello. Hang on.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.352
It's the bunny batterer.

00:30.360 --> 00:33.079
We wanted to invite you out to dinner
on Friday night.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.276
Oh, that'd be nice. Great.

00:36.640 --> 00:38.596
Listen, can I bring someone?

00:38.680 --> 00:41.353
Well, we are going to be inviting Pete.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.396
If we can get through to him.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.994
I'd rather not come on my own, if that's OK.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.832
Ah, well, er...

00:48.880 --> 00:51.110
Of course. He'll be really, really welcome.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.997
It must be his mother.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.832
Send him an e-mail.

01:03.440 --> 01:05.271
At last! A social life!

01:09.840 --> 01:11.990
Can I have some rice, Jen?

01:14.120 --> 01:16.076
<i>More?</i>

01:16.160 --> 01:19.232
Do you want another one, Adam?
- No, actually, I won't.

01:19.320 --> 01:21.072
<i>Karen?
- Thank you.</i>

01:21.160 --> 01:24.835
Well, it's the future, isn't it?
It's going to change everything.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.876
Cinema, television,

01:26.960 --> 01:29.110
telephone calls, sending mail.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.237
You won't have to go shopping.
- I like to go shopping.

01:32.320 --> 01:35.676
You'll still be able to,
but at least you'll have the option.

01:35.760 --> 01:39.389
To spend your life staring at a computer
screen like a sad bastard!

01:39.480 --> 01:41.198
<i>I am not a sad bastard.</i>

01:41.280 --> 01:44.158
I...have got my own home page.
- What?

01:44.240 --> 01:46.549
What's on it?
- A personal history.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.632
A few photos, a list of my favourite films.

01:49.720 --> 01:51.870
Escape To Victory?
- In at No.2!

01:51.960 --> 01:53.916
No.2? So, er, how many...

01:54.000 --> 01:55.558
What do you call them?

01:55.640 --> 01:59.189
..hits have you had so far?

01:59.280 --> 02:02.716
A few teething problems, you know.
Still in its early stages.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.552
None, zip, zilch, nada!

02:04.640 --> 02:07.916
Six, actually.
- Six? Do you know who they are?

02:09.120 --> 02:10.678
It's me.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.318
Yeah.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.916
I've got to check the site,
check it hasn't been tampered with.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.596
Maybe it's your design. Have a word
with Robert. He can give you a few tips.

02:22.920 --> 02:25.275
Look, you don't suffer fools gladly, right?

02:25.360 --> 02:28.033
I don't know. I was married to one
for long enough.

02:28.120 --> 02:29.678
You still are.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.877
My point is, maybe that's why
you're not a model employee.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.270
You're more intelligent
than the people you're working for.

02:36.360 --> 02:39.033
All right, Richard Branson, what's
the solution?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.588
Work for yourself.
- Never get the sack again!

02:41.680 --> 02:43.636
Maybe we could do something together.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.278
That'd be great!

02:45.360 --> 02:49.672
For the price of a local call, you can contact
anyone and talk about any topic under the sun.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.512
So, what do you talk about?

02:51.600 --> 02:54.831
<i>I talked to this bloke from Stockport
for over an hour</i>

02:54.920 --> 02:57.957
about how United could regain
European dominance.

02:58.040 --> 03:00.600
Hang on. For the price of a local call

03:00.680 --> 03:04.514
that allows you talk to anyone in the world
about any subject,

03:04.600 --> 03:09.116
you're on to some bloke just down the road
about your only topic of conversation?

03:09.200 --> 03:11.316
It's hardly cutting-edge stuff, is it?

03:13.400 --> 03:16.039
Well, it beats talking to yourself,
doesn't it?

03:17.400 --> 03:19.550
Got it! We'll open a restaurant!

03:19.640 --> 03:23.076
Initial outlay pushing a million,
a third fail within the first year.

03:23.160 --> 03:25.310
A sandwich shop?
- I'm not washing up.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.356
Escort agency?

03:27.440 --> 03:29.396
Oh, yes.
- Mm!

03:30.520 --> 03:33.478
Hi, if I could have your attention.
- Adam, sit down, please.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.030
I'm making an announcement.
- I know, but people are looking.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.036
Would you like me to whisper as well?

03:41.080 --> 03:45.358
Erm, thanks very much for coming.
There was a reason we asked you.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.159
I thought you just enjoyed our company.
- No.

03:48.240 --> 03:50.435
Yes. No. That's not the reason.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.436
We have an announcement to make.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.636
Ah! Rachel's pregnant!

03:59.120 --> 04:01.076
Well, they're trying.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.476
No, Rachel's not pregnant.
- I am, however...

04:05.560 --> 04:07.312
er...engaged to be married.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.958
To me!

04:09.040 --> 04:11.554
Oh, my God!
- Oh, Rachel!

04:13.680 --> 04:14.715
<i>Thanks.</i>

04:15.840 --> 04:18.195
<i>It's great news, isn't it?</i>

04:18.279 --> 04:21.238
Yeah, it's fantastic.
Not before time, I have to say.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.073
She looks so happy.
- I'm really pleased for her.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.718
Yeah, me, too.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.990
They're doing it for all the wrong reasons.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.640
''I'm infertile. Let's get married!''
Not good.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.679
No. If a marriage is going to last,
it's got to have strong foundations.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.991
I know that better than most.
- It smacks of desperation.

04:42.080 --> 04:45.311
A touch of clinging to the wreckage
about it.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.709
Do you think we should say something?
- You know her better than I do.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.233
Hey, hoo-di-hoo!

04:52.720 --> 04:55.314
Tell me honestly. Are we doing
the right thing?

04:55.400 --> 04:58.392
Absolutely. Yeah.
- Fantastic decision all round.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.629
OK.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.433
Blimey. Rachel can't have kids.
Does Adam know?

05:08.520 --> 05:11.159
Of course he knows. We all do.
- Well, I didn't.

05:11.240 --> 05:12.992
That's the Internet for you.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.833
Marriage, eh?
That's Adam's bachelor days over.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.673
No more going out with the lads.
No more beering it up.

05:18.760 --> 05:21.797
No more chasing other women.
- Does he chase other women?

05:21.880 --> 05:24.792
Come on! He goes out with Rachel. Would you?

05:24.880 --> 05:28.668
Doesn't drink much, doesn't go out any more.
- They are living together.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.832
Yeah, but why bother getting married?
- What?

05:31.920 --> 05:37.074
They're happy, then they can't have kids,
next thing, they're hearing wedding bells.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.236
Psst. Small dick.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.753
Really?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.398
Tiny.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.953
Well, that seemed to go off
very well, didn't it?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.798
Er, yeah. They all seemed
very pleased for us.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.992
Have you finished in there,
soon-to-be Mrs Williams?

06:10.080 --> 06:12.992
I have, soon-to-be Mr Bradley.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.112
<i>Manc Guy has entered the chat room.</i>

07:22.200 --> 07:24.634
Hi, Manc Guy, Stu from Stockport.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.678
What if Ronaldo played alongside Yorke?

07:28.800 --> 07:30.233
Er, sorry, Stu.

07:30.320 --> 07:32.993
No offence, but I'm all talked
out about United.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.911
<i>Cuffman has entered the chat room.</i>

07:35.000 --> 07:37.753
Hi, Manc Guy. I like your profile.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.673
Argh!
Cuffman, you're in the wrong chat room.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.955
Oh, shit! I'm always doing this.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.191
Manc Guy. Does that mean
you're from Manchester, England?

07:48.120 --> 07:51.954
I'm living in Heaton Moor.
- Fantastic! I'm from Heaton Chapel.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.832
So, just to check on your profile,

07:54.920 --> 07:58.674
quite a few people who come online
tend to bend the truth a little.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.716
No, I really am from Heaton Chapel.

08:01.840 --> 08:05.071
I mean, you sound like just the kind of guy
I'm looking for.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.954
26. Brunette. Very attractive.

08:10.040 --> 08:14.158
Yeah, right. She'll be a bloke,
some middle-aged pervert living in LA.

08:14.240 --> 08:16.310
No, she's definitely from round here.

08:16.400 --> 08:19.551
OK, some pervert living in Heaton Chapel.
Plenty of them.

08:19.640 --> 08:21.596
No. Why would she lie to me?

08:21.680 --> 08:24.752
Excuse me, who's the big fella who spends
all his time down the gym?

08:24.840 --> 08:26.796
Oh, cheers, no, it's harmless.

08:26.880 --> 08:28.836
Why would I want to meet her?

08:28.920 --> 08:32.071
Why not?
If she is gorgeous, you won't shag her?

08:32.159 --> 08:34.913
It's not like that. We talk, discuss ideas.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.433
Talk about life.
- Manchester United!

08:37.520 --> 08:41.638
No, but if we were to talk about football,
it would be on a higher plane,

08:41.720 --> 08:46.874
such as how the infiltration of foreign players
has undermined the club ethos as a whole.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.916
Brains as well as looks!

08:49.000 --> 08:50.752
Ah, and that's just me!

08:50.840 --> 08:53.798
So what is this chat room
where you met Helen of Troy?

08:53.880 --> 08:55.836
No, her chat name is Girlpower.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.150
What do you call yourself?
- Manc Guy!

08:58.240 --> 08:59.798
Girlpower's good.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.310
''What are you wearing?'' What?

09:04.400 --> 09:08.234
It's brilliant. He met this 26-year-old
brunette in this chat room.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.470
At least, that's what she claimed to be.

09:10.560 --> 09:13.632
They hit it off,
they talk to each other every other day.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.554
He gave me the address of this chat room
and the name the woman goes by.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.790
I just thought I'd borrow her identity.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.472
Oh, he's got his lucky boxers on!
This is gold!

09:24.560 --> 09:26.516
Hang on. Are you this woman?

09:26.600 --> 09:28.352
Tonight, Matthew, I am...

09:28.440 --> 09:31.512
How do you spell negligee?
- No, I mean, does she exist?

09:31.600 --> 09:33.352
Two Es on the end!

09:33.440 --> 09:38.309
If you were a stunningly attractive 26-year-old
brunette - a couple of years ago, you were -

09:38.480 --> 09:40.630
would you look for love on the Internet?

09:40.720 --> 09:43.598
It's clearly a wind-up.
I'm just winding him up a wee bit more.

09:43.680 --> 09:45.636
Er, so...

09:45.720 --> 09:49.110
You know, all this talk,
it's making me a bit, well, erm...

09:50.240 --> 09:52.196
Erm, you know...

09:52.280 --> 09:54.555
I-I-I think we should meet.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.712
I think you should stop.
- Oh, come on!

09:57.800 --> 09:59.756
I'll let him in on it tomorrow.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.796
Or the day after.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.836
I want you to stop.
- No!

10:05.760 --> 10:08.433
Hey, you could damage the hard disk
doing that!

10:38.680 --> 10:40.432
<i>25 pounds?</i>

10:40.520 --> 10:45.196
Yeah, well, that was just to see it. 100 quid
for the X-ray to establish what's wrong.

10:45.280 --> 10:49.239
If it's broken, rather than dislocated,
it could be as much as 400 quid to get it fixed.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.753
What?

10:50.840 --> 10:52.796
It's a rabbit, not a racehorse.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.429
Can't the vet just put it out of its misery?
Give it an injection.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.869
Or hit it over the head? That'd be cheaper.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.396
She won't. It's a perfectly healthy animal.
She will not put it down.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.597
It is not perfectly healthy! It's got
a broken leg!

11:06.680 --> 11:09.194
<i>Why do you think
we took it there in the first place?</i>

11:10.840 --> 11:12.193
Ah. Sorry.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.113
Ahem. I was expecting Karen. Is she in?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.956
Karen! Someone at the door for you.

11:20.560 --> 11:22.516
A member of the paparazzi.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.318
Oh, my God, hello! David, this is Brodie.
I was telling you about him.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.152
This is my husband David.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.673
Hello.
- Hello.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.153
Come in, come in.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.397
Karen tells me that you knew each other
at university.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.436
Ah, yes, that's right. Wild times!

11:44.520 --> 11:46.476
Yes, so I understand.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.390
Hm.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.311
Oh, she's told you, has she?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.595
Some of it.
- Right.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.432
Well, it was a long time ago.

11:53.520 --> 11:56.034
And the years have been kinder to Karen.

11:56.120 --> 11:58.998
Mm. That's a nice drop. Chilean, is it?

12:00.040 --> 12:01.792
Yes. Yes, it is.

12:01.880 --> 12:04.155
David, he reads the labels.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.876
Well, I'll leave you to it.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.916
You've got a good memory.

12:12.000 --> 12:15.675
So, off on your travels again?
Come to say goodbye?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.716
No. Come to ask you a favour.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.796
Ah! It's exciting, isn't it?

12:20.880 --> 12:22.836
God, I love weddings.

12:23.880 --> 12:26.348
How are the arrangements going?
- It's off.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.356
Really? I've got to say...

12:29.440 --> 12:32.796
I'm so relieved. Karen and I were
really worried.

12:32.880 --> 12:36.429
We thought you were doing it
for the wrong reasons. Thank God!

12:37.640 --> 12:39.995
No. The milk's off.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.759
Shit.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.756
Bugger. I haven't got any more.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.910
It doesn't matter. I'll have it black.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.518
Where were we?

12:57.240 --> 12:58.798
Bourbon?

12:59.880 --> 13:02.235
Ah, Ramona, just putting out some rubbish.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.072
You can take this, too!

13:04.160 --> 13:05.912
No, this is for recycling.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.510
That bag. It just moved!

13:09.600 --> 13:11.397
Hm?

13:11.480 --> 13:13.869
You...! Karen!

13:14.920 --> 13:16.592
<i>Quickly! Come!</i>

13:16.680 --> 13:19.274
What's going on?
- Look! The bag!

13:20.720 --> 13:22.199
What's in the bag, David?

13:23.320 --> 13:24.753
Hector.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.876
I was just taking her out.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.598
For a walk.

13:28.680 --> 13:31.148
In a plastic bag?

13:32.280 --> 13:35.590
Yeah. With her leg,
I thought she might prefer being carried.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.955
You were going to kill her!
- No, I wasn't.

13:38.040 --> 13:42.397
I wouldn't have it in me!
I was just going to...just set her free.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.232
It's the school rabbit.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.630
David resents having to pay 400 quid
to mend its broken leg.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.757
I don't blame you. It's a pity you're
not penniless.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.354
If you're on income support,
the RSPCA do it for free.

13:53.440 --> 13:55.237
Really?

13:55.320 --> 13:58.676
<i>Look, I'm not saying you
shouldn't be together.</i>

13:58.760 --> 14:00.910
Just that we shouldn't get married.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.956
No! Well, yeah.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.996
Well, just, not now.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.230
Why?

14:08.400 --> 14:10.356
Well, why are you getting married?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.392
Cos he asked me.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.391
Why did he ask you?

14:15.480 --> 14:17.914
I know. It's been bothering me, too.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.516
I should talk to him, shouldn't I?

14:23.560 --> 14:26.313
To be honest, yeah, I think you should.

14:27.520 --> 14:29.476
Why did you ask me to marry you?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.756
Because I love you.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.358
So it had nothing to do with
the fact that I can't have children?

14:39.520 --> 14:40.475
No.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.713
OK. Let's try that again without
the hesitation.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.193
Face it, Adam.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.955
You offered out of charity
and I accepted out of fear.

14:57.840 --> 15:00.354
Are you saying you don't want to marry me?

15:00.440 --> 15:03.193
No, I'm not saying I don't want to
marry you.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.838
I'm saying...

15:05.960 --> 15:07.916
I think we should wait.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.195
Call the engagement off?

15:10.280 --> 15:14.796
Not necessarily. We haven't set a date.
We could just let it slide.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.836
You know, have a long engagement.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.878
Why do people do that?
Wait two years for the wedding?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.712
I don't know.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.838
Maybe it's a...

15:24.920 --> 15:26.876
a cooling-off period.

15:26.960 --> 15:29.269
You know, like buying a time-share.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.630
So, we're still engaged, but we're not going
to get married until the time's right?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.870
Yep.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.428
How do we know when the time's right?

15:49.560 --> 15:52.518
Bobby? Listen, I've been thinking, right,

15:52.600 --> 15:55.558
about...what you said
about me starting my own business.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.791
Me too. What have you come up with?
- No, go on, you first.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.836
Well, I tell you what I'd pay for.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.876
Someone to iron my shirts.

16:02.960 --> 16:05.110
That's the punch line.
- Eh?

16:05.200 --> 16:08.351
Obviously, that is a joke.
- No, I'm deadly serious.

16:08.440 --> 16:12.069
There are loads of blokes like me, Jen,
gorgeous, wealthy, busy.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.232
Deluded!
- All right, brainbox, what's your idea?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.276
Marriage-guidance counsellor.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.033
Daa-daah!

16:20.120 --> 16:22.759
Yeah? Come on! I sorted Rachel
out, didn't I?

16:22.840 --> 16:25.115
No. You told Rachel not to get married!

16:40.280 --> 16:44.637
How would you react if I was to tell you
I was thinking of having an affair?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.036
How did you expect me to react?

16:53.440 --> 16:55.192
That's why I can't tell you.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.555
Then why are we having this conversation?

16:57.640 --> 16:59.596
But we're not. In reality.

16:59.680 --> 17:02.194
But I need someone to talk to.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.349
Can't you talk to Adam or Pete about this?

17:04.440 --> 17:06.954
No! No, they're totally unreliable!

17:07.040 --> 17:08.996
It would get back to you in no time.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.230
Darling, I'm just going to pick Josh up.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.919
So you want a few tips
on how to seduce women?

17:25.160 --> 17:27.627
Is there anyone in particular
you had in mind?

17:28.680 --> 17:29.749
Jessica.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.679
Sorry. Go on.

17:35.720 --> 17:39.030
You see, I think she wants to. And I do.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.435
It's not going to harm you and me.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.829
It's just a...sexual thing.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.238
Anyway, she's asked me to call her.
And I have.

17:49.320 --> 17:52.118
We're meeting for lunch on Wednesday.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.760
You don't need my help at all, David.

17:55.280 --> 17:57.191
<i>Really?</i>

17:57.280 --> 17:59.191
No.

17:59.280 --> 18:02.829
It seems to me all you have to do now
is book the hotel room.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.438
Right.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.076
And David?

18:10.120 --> 18:12.076
Don't book anywhere sordid.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.720
Put your hand in your pocket for once.

18:20.120 --> 18:23.590
<i>David, I've got Alan's office on.
They want to arrange a lunch.</i>

18:23.680 --> 18:26.513
Excellent. Whenever suits them.
Clear the diary.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.556
<i>They're suggestlng today.</i>

18:28.640 --> 18:33.316
Today? No, I can't today. I've got
something on. Forgot to tell you. Sorry.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.918
<i>Can lt be moved?</i>

18:36.000 --> 18:38.639
No, no. Look, any other day, all right?

18:39.680 --> 18:43.355
Oh, and Hazel,
I may be back a bit late this afternoon.

18:46.840 --> 18:50.116
When we were at university,
how much of a pose was the camera?

18:50.200 --> 18:51.758
Oh, totally.

18:51.840 --> 18:54.877
Ask any good-looking woman
if she's ever thought of modelling

18:54.960 --> 18:57.474
and you'd be amazed
how many wanted to sleep with me.

18:57.560 --> 19:00.199
Ironic you actually turned out to be
quite good.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.032
Brilliant, actually.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.876
Have you ever thought of modelling?

19:08.520 --> 19:10.556
Hey, there's Jenny. Hey, Jen!

19:12.440 --> 19:13.873
Hello!

19:14.920 --> 19:17.195
You were miles away. Are you all right?

19:17.280 --> 19:19.032
Yeah, fine. Hiya.

19:19.120 --> 19:20.678
Hello.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.591
Miles Brodie.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.716
I've heard about you. Rachel.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.189
Glad to see I'm a topic of conversation.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.068
Well, we live very dull and empty
lives up here.

19:34.280 --> 19:37.477
I don't know. I just lost my job.

19:37.560 --> 19:39.118
Oh, not again? Why?

19:39.200 --> 19:43.751
Wasting company resources.
Made a daisy chain out of paperclips.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.796
And they fired you for that?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.836
Fair enough, really. 1760.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.876
It took me the best part of a week.

19:52.240 --> 19:54.390
Listen, why don't you join us?

19:54.480 --> 19:56.436
Yeah. Come on.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.476
All right, then. Ta.

20:09.280 --> 20:11.236
Johnson.
- Ah, right, sir. Yes.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.118
As arranged.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.993
Thank you. I'll just have someone
help you with your bags.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.636
Um, the thing is...

20:33.640 --> 20:36.279
have you seen the film, The Graduate?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.316
Ah.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.075
Then I take it you won't be requiring
a newspaper in the morning?

20:44.280 --> 20:46.236
Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.798
<i>However brief.</i>

20:57.480 --> 20:59.038
David.
- Patrick.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.396
Karen's not here.
She's gone out with one of her friends.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.233
Oh, right. In that case, I'm going to go.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.390
Before you do,
can you help me with something?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.431
Yeah, of course. If I can.

21:16.520 --> 21:18.476
I don't know Manchester very well.

21:18.560 --> 21:20.994
I need to know where are the really
poor parts.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.679
Are you looking for somewhere to buy?
- No. No!

21:24.760 --> 21:27.194
For the rabbit. You know she broke his leg.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.713
No!

21:28.800 --> 21:33.396
Yeah. I don't know how.
The vet cost too much, unless you're poor.

21:33.480 --> 21:39.430
And David, he said there are some children
at this school who are very poor.

21:39.520 --> 21:40.669
Really?

21:40.760 --> 21:44.116
So I have to go through all this list
to find a very poor boy

21:44.200 --> 21:47.078
to take the rabbit to the vet
to have him fixed for nothing.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.435
That's terrible.
- It's not a very easy job for me.

21:49.520 --> 21:53.274
Ramona, I can help you.
Have you got a cardboard box?

22:11.800 --> 22:13.358
Right.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.676
Well, I fancy a shower.

22:18.640 --> 22:20.596
Yeah. Good idea.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.636
Right, I'll wait here and erm...

22:25.680 --> 22:27.636
..check if they've got CNN.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.518
David?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.516
I fancy a shower with you.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.596
An exhibition?

22:54.680 --> 22:57.831
I'm not sure I'd know where to start.

22:57.920 --> 23:01.469
It's up and running in London.
It's just a case of the publicity.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.516
I'll give it a go.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.511
And we have to find a venue.

23:05.600 --> 23:08.558
I thought maybe one of those warehouses
in Castlefield.

23:08.640 --> 23:10.198
What about the Lowry?

23:10.280 --> 23:11.838
What, the museum?

23:11.920 --> 23:15.390
It's a big building.
Can't be that many matchstick paintings.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.598
If you think we can get it.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.636
See? She's already earning her keep.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.676
Ooh, do we get paid an' all?

23:22.760 --> 23:24.512
A figure of speech.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.029
Yeah, well, you never know
how it will pan out.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.872
Right, then, you're on!

23:29.960 --> 23:33.839
We'll have to have an opening party,
for charity, you know.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.876
Something Third Worldy.

23:35.960 --> 23:37.916
Yeah, great idea.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.833
Right. Sod it. Champagne!

23:50.320 --> 23:55.030
We have reason to believe that an act of
illicit sex is about to be perpetrated in this room.

23:55.120 --> 23:56.599
Don't move!

24:28.960 --> 24:33.670
OK. I will call you tomorrow once
I've spoken to the gallery in London, OK?

24:33.760 --> 24:35.193
OK.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.236
Make a good team, don't we?

24:38.280 --> 24:40.236
What, you, me and Jenny?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.754
Er, well, I was thinking of you and me.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.513
Yeah.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.556
We always have done.

24:47.640 --> 24:50.393
We've always had
a certain understanding, yeah.

24:52.440 --> 24:56.433
Do you remember...
Do you remember Rock Against Racism?

24:56.520 --> 25:01.196
Underneath the stage while The Stranglers
were playing Peaches! Yes, I remember.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.714
I notice you've got the CD.
- It's David's.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.756
Ah.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.796
I wonder if it sounds as good.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.116
Better, probably. The acoustics
were terrible.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.555
Brodie, are you making a pass at me?

25:17.640 --> 25:19.073
Erm...

25:19.160 --> 25:21.116
If I was, what would you say?

25:24.640 --> 25:26.596
You're serious, aren't you?

25:28.640 --> 25:30.790
I'd say, don't be so bloody ridiculous.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.592
No would have done.

25:37.640 --> 25:39.596
I'll call you tomorrow.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.876
That's better.
- Hm?

25:56.960 --> 25:58.916
You're more relaxed than you were.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.558
You can tell?

26:02.600 --> 26:04.158
Oh, I see.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.236
Take me to bed, David.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.996
I had this fantastic session with Girlpower.

26:20.080 --> 26:24.039
I was going to talk to you about that.
- But it started getting a bit weird.

26:24.120 --> 26:27.112
She was coming on strong,
talking about peanut butter.

26:27.200 --> 26:28.952
Well, the thing is...
- No, no, no.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.999
But this morning,
she denied the conversation ever took place.

26:33.080 --> 26:37.198
I've decided to play it her way
and say the whole thing never happened.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.838
Really?
- Yeah.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.876
I even know her real name.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.315
What?
- Heeve. Brenda Heeve.

26:43.400 --> 26:46.756
Heeve?
- Yeah, Heeve. It's Dutch or something.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.036
You're a dark horse.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.756
In what way?

26:55.840 --> 26:58.274
Well, you seemed almost reluctant at first.

26:59.600 --> 27:01.875
Wanting to watch CNN.

27:02.920 --> 27:04.478
No, I didn't, really.

27:04.560 --> 27:07.518
Do you think I'd have stayed if you did?

27:08.560 --> 27:11.632
It's just that I haven't done
this kind of thing before.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.636
I know.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.035
I bet most men feel nervous at first.

27:20.520 --> 27:23.353
And once they've overcome their nerves,

27:23.440 --> 27:26.079
what do you think they feel then?

27:26.160 --> 27:27.309
Guilt.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.356
She has no intention of meeting you.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.874
In the end you'll find out she's a bloke.
- Bollocks!

27:32.960 --> 27:36.839
Girlpower, my arse. She's a bloke.
She hasn't exactly been backward.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.798
She made contact first,
she told you her name first.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.836
There was all that sexy stuff.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.276
Well, that aside.
- No, hang on. I arranged to meet her.

27:45.360 --> 27:47.112
She said where and when.

27:47.200 --> 27:50.078
Oh, yeah? Public toilets? Gents?
- Er, no. School.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.438
School. She's a teacher.
A sexy, 26-year-old teacher.

27:54.520 --> 27:57.273
Who, my 50 quid says, turns out
to be a bloke.

27:58.440 --> 28:00.112
Done.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.156
Right, yeah, 500, full colour.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.674
Yeah. When can I have them by, please?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.716
Right. What's your name?

28:06.800 --> 28:08.756
Mark? OK, Mark.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.796
I'll let you know. Ta. Thanks.

28:10.880 --> 28:14.429
Hey, Jamie Oliver, I thought
you were doing dinner.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.671
First things first. Let's find
a baby-sitter.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.832
I've got 101 things to do
for this exhibition.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.672
So, do them tomorrow.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.433
I'll have 101 things to do then, an' all.

28:25.520 --> 28:28.478
We went out last night. It'd be nice
to stay in.

28:28.560 --> 28:33.270
Fine. Tell you what. You stay in, do your
101 things, and I'll go out, all right?

28:34.280 --> 28:39.479
Robert? I thought that you'd be pleased
about all this. It might lead somewhere.

28:39.560 --> 28:41.312
To you working all hours!

28:41.400 --> 28:44.995
I would be pleased, but evenings
are our time.

28:46.800 --> 28:49.758
You better answer that. See you tomorrow.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.149
Robert!
- Jen, it's fine, really.

28:53.680 --> 28:54.635
Shit.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.199
Hello?

28:57.720 --> 28:59.278
David, what is it?

28:59.360 --> 29:02.830
Karen, I've done a dreadful thing!
I slept with another woman.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.399
You what?

29:04.480 --> 29:07.472
I don't know what got into me!
I just lost my mind!

29:09.600 --> 29:11.636
David, what is it?

29:13.280 --> 29:14.793
Nothing.

29:15.840 --> 29:17.592
Just a bad dream.

29:18.640 --> 29:20.596
Sorry, darling.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.636
Go back to sleep.

29:36.280 --> 29:40.432
Hiya. Listen, don't unload till I've checked
with the manager, all right, Brodie?

29:40.520 --> 29:45.071
I suggest you take the whole lot up
before we decide what goes where.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.593
Hi.

29:48.360 --> 29:50.316
She has everything under control.

29:50.400 --> 29:53.551
Yeah, well, control freaks generally do.
She's been bending my ear.

29:53.640 --> 29:57.519
Did I get take the invitations to
the printers, have I checked the guest list,

29:57.600 --> 29:59.670
did I send the invites out first class?

29:59.760 --> 30:02.832
Calling you Brodie.
She's only known you five minutes!

30:02.920 --> 30:04.876
Do I detect a note of jealousy?

30:04.960 --> 30:06.712
Oh, piss off!

30:07.600 --> 30:09.556
Bingo, Brodie! We can go up now.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.552
I'll check the doors are open.
If you get all this unloaded.

30:12.640 --> 30:14.596
Ja, mein Fuhrer.

30:16.240 --> 30:18.196
430 pounds?

30:18.280 --> 30:20.236
Including VAT.

30:20.320 --> 30:24.438
The NHS doesn't stretch to rabbits.
It was my fault, so I had to do something.

30:24.520 --> 30:26.476
What's wrong with a friggin' stew?

30:26.560 --> 30:28.232
430 pounds!

30:28.320 --> 30:30.276
You sound just like David.

30:30.360 --> 30:31.588
Urgh!

30:32.320 --> 30:33.548
Urgh!

30:45.520 --> 30:48.990
We could put all of the India pictures
together. - Good idea.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.638
For a travel agent's.

30:52.680 --> 30:54.636
It was only a suggestion.

30:56.680 --> 31:01.435
What about splitting them up
into northern and southern hemispheres?

31:01.520 --> 31:06.116
I think we should hang them randomly,
each work of art in its own right.

31:06.200 --> 31:09.715
I don't think we should categorise them,
I really don't.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.719
What, you don't like my north-south
idea, then?

31:13.800 --> 31:15.756
Eh? Yeah.

31:17.280 --> 31:21.239
What? Look, we'll do this.
There's loads of jobs for you to do, Karen.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.276
I could murder a coffee.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.918
Ooh, cup of tea!

31:25.000 --> 31:26.479
Brodie!

31:26.560 --> 31:28.835
Right. I've got it.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.876
<i>Gobi Desert...there.</i>

31:30.960 --> 31:33.793
<i>The first thing people see
when they walk in the door.</i>

31:33.880 --> 31:35.438
Great idea.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.078
Genius.

32:05.440 --> 32:09.797
I thought the thing about having no kids was that
we wouldn't have to do any more big shopping.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.632
We've forgotten milk.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.278
Corner shop.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.316
You've left the door open!

32:15.400 --> 32:16.958
Hector!

32:29.920 --> 32:31.478
Oh, dear.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.239
Karen's taking a long time with them drinks.

33:12.080 --> 33:14.036
Hello?
- Hello.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.076
Are you lost?

33:16.160 --> 33:18.310
I'm looking for a teacher.

33:18.400 --> 33:22.075
What sort are you after? History,
physics...?

33:22.160 --> 33:23.912
I wouldn't choose physics.

33:24.000 --> 33:27.675
Erm, no, it's Miss Heeve.
Her name's Brenda Heeve.

33:27.760 --> 33:30.832
Miss Heeve! Year 8. Citizenship.

33:31.880 --> 33:33.836
What? What the hell's that?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.672
Never did that at our school.

33:35.760 --> 33:39.799
We did the three Rs.
Reading, writing and 'rithmetic!

33:39.880 --> 33:41.632
Not spelling, then?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.278
No.

33:43.360 --> 33:47.239
This is Helen, I'm Julie,
but you can call me Scary, as in Spice.

33:47.320 --> 33:50.278
Ah. Erm...I'm Pete,

33:50.360 --> 33:53.591
and you can call me Old, as in Spice.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.554
It's dead here. Where is everybody?

33:58.640 --> 34:01.074
Playing truant. Some are in lesson.

34:01.160 --> 34:02.718
Why aren't you?

34:02.800 --> 34:05.678
<i>We're on our way! Come on. We'll show you.</i>

34:11.480 --> 34:13.630
Well, I think it looks just like Hector.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.636
More so before her accident.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.312
This is where you want.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.358
No, no, no. I'm meeting her at
the staff room.

34:28.440 --> 34:33.036
Well, if you want to wait till lunch,
but that's not for another hour.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.235
What's she like this teacher?

34:37.320 --> 34:40.152
Miss Heeve? Come on, let's wait inside.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.632
Come on. It'll be quieter.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.676
You sit here. Go on!

35:08.440 --> 35:10.396
What's she really like?

35:10.480 --> 35:12.675
She's dead nice. Old.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.193
How old?

35:14.280 --> 35:16.316
Maybe 30.
- Well, that's all right.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.958
Quite attractive.
- Yeah?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.036
Oh, you must be Pete!
- Yeah, yeah. Hi.

35:25.120 --> 35:27.759
It's really good of you to come.
Didn't think you would.

35:27.840 --> 35:31.071
Well, I had to think twice,
especially when I first got here.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.832
I'm not surprised.

35:32.920 --> 35:37.072
I'm just about to start, so er...
Why don't you sit there?

35:39.440 --> 35:43.592
Er... I thought we could go and have a chat
somewhere else, you know.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.754
Er...I'll come to you in a minute.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.558
OK. Fine.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.714
<i>By this time, I'd decided she was a nutter.</i>

35:54.800 --> 35:59.351
I can see that she might want to meet
somewhere a bit public, but in her lesson?

36:03.320 --> 36:07.359
Thank you, Matthew, for that account of the
Enigma code-breaking machine

36:07.440 --> 36:09.396
used in World War Two.

36:09.480 --> 36:11.436
Next, Julie Clements.

36:20.800 --> 36:24.031
When we were first set this project
on deception,

36:24.120 --> 36:27.829
I thought it would be interesting
to look at how modern technology

36:27.920 --> 36:30.070
is permitting new forms of deceit.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.271
<i>I therefore decided to use the Internet
to see, to what degree,</i>

36:34.360 --> 36:36.555
<i>it would allow me to mislead another person.</i>

36:36.640 --> 36:38.596
<i>Using the nickname Girlpower,</i>

36:38.680 --> 36:44.152
<i>I entered a chat room, posing as an
attractive 26-year-old wanting a boyfriend.</i>

36:44.240 --> 36:46.435
Here he is. Come on. Come up.

36:52.760 --> 36:57.515
So the object of your affection was a
14-year-old girl doing a school project!

36:58.760 --> 37:00.512
Oh, it was so humiliating.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.556
<i>Especially...</i>

37:04.600 --> 37:07.956
<i>Especially when they made me
take a bow in front of the class.</i>

37:35.880 --> 37:38.519
Oh, go on! I don't want to go on my own.

37:38.600 --> 37:42.559
No. I don't want to be in the same room
as either Brodie or Jenny.

37:42.640 --> 37:45.279
You don't have to speak to them.
Plenty of other people.

37:45.360 --> 37:47.999
<i>Anyone who's anyone in Manchester
will be there. Please!</i>

37:48.080 --> 37:49.957
No! Move!

37:54.280 --> 37:56.316
Ramona's offered to baby-sit.

37:56.400 --> 37:58.595
Well, I'll baby-sit and you can take Ramona.

37:59.640 --> 38:02.074
All right, I'll go on my own, but
I won't enjoy it.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.588
You have to admit, it's a bloody
good project!

38:16.680 --> 38:18.830
She well deserved her A.

38:20.280 --> 38:21.713
It's amazing.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.115
So, Brenda Heeve never existed?

38:28.160 --> 38:30.116
It's an anagram.

38:30.200 --> 38:33.954
''Ever...been...had?''

38:40.120 --> 38:42.076
Ever been had!

38:42.160 --> 38:45.391
No, I mean it's good
you can tell that story against yourself.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.630
The joke isn't necessarily upon me.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.995
Oh, yeah?
- You owe me 50 quid.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.638
How do you mean?

38:51.720 --> 38:57.078
She may have been 14, but she wasn't
a bloke. And I have got a date out of it.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.718
Hi.
- Hi.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.472
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.838
Perfect timing.

39:10.240 --> 39:16.190
I know you must be really pissed off, and you've
every right to be, cos I've been a right cow.

39:16.280 --> 39:20.319
I was getting dressed for this sodding
opening and I thought,

39:20.400 --> 39:24.234
''That's no way to behave. Karen is your mate
and she is not going to go cos of you.

39:24.320 --> 39:25.639
She's gonna stay home.

39:25.720 --> 39:30.430
If I was any kind of a friend,
I would apologise and keep her company.''

39:30.520 --> 39:32.476
And that's what I'm here to do.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.598
So you're not going to go?

39:36.680 --> 39:40.150
No, I'm not. And I'm really,
really sorry, Karen.

39:40.240 --> 39:44.995
And if there's anything I can do
to help you forgive me, I'll do it.

39:45.080 --> 39:46.638
Baby-sit.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.870
Any time.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.633
Tonight, please, so I can go to the opening.

39:53.280 --> 39:55.430
Right. OK.

39:55.520 --> 39:57.875
Hey, make sure you're home by 12.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.678
Don't be daft. Ramona can baby-sit.

40:03.560 --> 40:04.788
Really?

40:04.880 --> 40:07.997
Don't tell me you haven't got your dress
in the car.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.638
No, I haven't!

40:09.720 --> 40:12.996
Oh, well, I have, all right.
But just in case, you know.

40:13.080 --> 40:15.036
<i>On the off chance.</i>

40:15.120 --> 40:16.678
Come in.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.278
Ah, thank you.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.032
Thanks very much.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.638
David.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.278
Jessica.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.316
I didn't expect to see you.

40:34.400 --> 40:38.029
Why not?
Anyone who's anyone in Manchester's here.

40:38.120 --> 40:41.556
Well, a few footballers and their
scrawny wives.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.997
Yeah. Look at that one over there.
She looks like a Lowry model.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.230
Apart from the way she's dressed.

40:51.160 --> 40:53.116
I haven't seen Karen anywhere.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.633
No, she's not here.

40:58.760 --> 41:01.911
Everything's fine. Fine.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.878
She's just not here. One of the twins
is ill.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.518
Oh, I'm sorry.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.198
So...

41:10.560 --> 41:12.516
Do you fancy lunch again?

41:12.600 --> 41:14.158
No!

41:14.240 --> 41:17.869
No, I can't. I'm sorry, I'm...dieting.

41:19.600 --> 41:23.559
Work's just gone crazy
and we can't take lunch. I'm sorry.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.758
David, I understand what you're
going through. I really do.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.995
But I'm sure it'll get easier.

41:32.080 --> 41:34.036
Don't worry, David.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.076
The guilt will wear off.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.076
I just don't want it to.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.433
Hi, darling.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.078
Karen!

41:50.120 --> 41:52.076
I thought you were still at home.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.072
Yeah, well, a friend persuaded me to come.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.113
Hiya.

42:07.200 --> 42:08.428
Hey!

42:09.480 --> 42:11.436
Down to you, all this, you know.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.078
Oh, shut up.

42:13.160 --> 42:16.516
Brodie took the pictures. Got to
give him that.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.556
Yeah, but without you...

42:19.600 --> 42:21.158
Nice one.

42:36.040 --> 42:38.600
I thought about becoming a photographer
once.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.238
Oh, God!

42:40.320 --> 42:42.959
I remember
when you wanted to become an author!

42:43.040 --> 42:44.792
Oh, yeah. Hm.

42:44.880 --> 42:46.632
How hard could it be?

42:46.720 --> 42:51.236
You don't even have to focus any more.
There's a button that does that for you.

42:51.320 --> 42:53.470
And Snappy Snaps will do the rest!

42:53.560 --> 42:55.073
Well, yes, actually.

42:57.160 --> 42:59.116
This looks like Mauritius.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.116
Oh, yeah, it is Mauritius.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.553
Oh!

43:04.600 --> 43:06.158
Oh, wow!

43:08.280 --> 43:10.510
It's beautiful, eh?

43:13.280 --> 43:15.236
This is our beach!

43:15.320 --> 43:17.470
Our hut was just off to the right!

43:17.560 --> 43:21.235
Oh, yeah,
that's where I hammered you at Frisbee.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.754
Only because you made up the rules.

43:23.840 --> 43:25.796
<i>Oh, we were happy then, eh?</i>

43:28.240 --> 43:29.798
We're happy now.

43:29.880 --> 43:31.836
Yeah, I know, I know.

43:31.920 --> 43:35.037
But erm...really happy. Carefree.

43:35.120 --> 43:39.796
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to begln the charity auction.</i>

43:40.360 --> 43:42.794
Adam, I'm sick of being miserable.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.118
Me too.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.395
Hello.

44:06.560 --> 44:10.838
Karen, I want to bid, but I don't want
Adam to know. Will you do it?

44:10.920 --> 44:13.673
Of course I will. How high do you
want to go?

44:13.760 --> 44:18.038
We're a bit strapped after that rabbit saga...
- Yeah, I heard about that rabbit saga.

44:18.120 --> 44:22.557
The school were delighted to have Hector back,
though confused at the changed sex.

44:22.640 --> 44:24.596
Oh. Well, there's a story...

44:24.680 --> 44:26.636
I don't think I want to know.

44:26.720 --> 44:30.269
The proceeds will go to Save The Children.
- We'll go to 250 quid.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.918
OK.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.719
Shall we start at, say, 300 pounds?

44:34.800 --> 44:36.677
Oh, God.
- 300 pounds.

44:36.760 --> 44:38.159
300 pounds.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.754
350.
- No, Karen, I'm out.

44:40.840 --> 44:42.592
Yeah. I'm still in.

44:42.680 --> 44:45.399
350 I'm bid. 350.

44:45.480 --> 44:49.393
400.
- 400, the lady on the left. 400.

44:49.480 --> 44:52.438
450.
- 450. 450 at the front.

44:52.520 --> 44:54.272
475.

44:54.360 --> 44:57.796
<i>475, the gentleman in the suit. 475.</i>

44:58.920 --> 45:00.672
Going once, going twice...

45:00.760 --> 45:03.479
500.
- 500.

45:03.560 --> 45:06.438
What on earth are you doing?
- Oh, keep your hair on.

45:06.520 --> 45:09.478
I'm bid 500.
- I'm bidding on Rachel's behalf.

45:09.560 --> 45:11.516
Going once, going twice,

45:11.600 --> 45:13.511
sold...to...

45:13.600 --> 45:15.989
the beautiful Stranglers fan.

45:17.120 --> 45:19.918
Perhaps you'd like to come with me
and choose your picture.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.632
You know I said I was sick of
being miserable?

45:29.720 --> 45:32.075
I did reply, but you'd buggered off.

45:32.160 --> 45:35.709
What did you say?
- Not interrupting anything, am I?

45:35.800 --> 45:37.756
I wanted to give you this.

45:37.840 --> 45:39.796
It's an engagement present.

45:39.880 --> 45:42.633
How did you know?
- I saw you standing by it.

45:42.720 --> 45:45.553
If you don't like it, I'm sure Brodie
will change it.

45:45.640 --> 45:48.677
No, it's perfect. Thanks, Karen.
- Karen, thank you.

45:49.720 --> 45:52.473
I'd better go.
David will be wondering where I am.

45:55.280 --> 45:57.236
Well, that's our first present.

45:58.960 --> 46:01.190
I feel a bit of a fraud for accepting it.

46:02.240 --> 46:03.593
Yeah.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.955
You know, I love you, Rachel Bradley.

46:09.280 --> 46:11.236
I love you, Adam Williams.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.512
Adam...
- Yeah?

46:15.680 --> 46:17.238
Will you marry me?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.672
I'd love to.
