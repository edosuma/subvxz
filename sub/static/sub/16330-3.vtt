00:02.216 --> 00:05.236
Look, I don't want to talk to
you about this on the phone.

00:05.275 --> 00:07.452
Is it 100% above board? No.

00:07.487 --> 00:10.671
Are we gonna get caught?
No, I seriously doubt it.

00:10.722 --> 00:12.553
Look, I'll be in the office in 15 minutes.

00:12.604 --> 00:14.087
Let's talk about it then.

00:16.168 --> 00:17.744
Oh, wait, somebody left their bag in here.

00:18.075 --> 00:23.954

00:36.188 --> 00:38.188
(grunting)

01:02.675 --> 01:04.669
Roman and Shepherd want to see you.

01:04.766 --> 01:06.384
Where am I?

01:23.405 --> 01:24.980
(Roman) How are you feeling?

01:25.055 --> 01:27.383
Groggy. What happened to me?

01:27.446 --> 01:28.373
I drugged you.

01:28.425 --> 01:29.997
You can't know where we're located.

01:30.032 --> 01:31.349
Ever heard of a blindfold?

01:31.384 --> 01:33.050
(Shepherd) Sit down.

01:40.937 --> 01:42.844
What's wrong?

01:42.896 --> 01:45.144
How did you escape?

01:45.179 --> 01:46.034
What?

01:46.069 --> 01:47.516
Cade...

01:48.142 --> 01:49.985
How did you escape?

01:50.522 --> 01:52.678
He kept me in a small cell

01:52.713 --> 01:55.033
with no bed and no window.

01:55.068 --> 01:56.563
But, there was a drain in the floor.

01:56.598 --> 02:00.184
I fashioned some rope and used
the grate to make a homemade mace.

02:00.219 --> 02:02.611
He came in to torture me, I made my move.

02:02.670 --> 02:04.397
How often did you see him?

02:04.475 --> 02:05.773
Every day.

02:05.824 --> 02:07.790
He tortured you every day?

02:07.864 --> 02:09.279
Yes.

02:10.703 --> 02:14.076
We got a call from a
fixer we use sometimes.

02:14.477 --> 02:15.911
(Shepherd) Cade contacted him.

02:15.989 --> 02:18.868
Wanted a fake passport
and passage to Venezuela.

02:18.919 --> 02:20.013
Great. Can we...

02:20.048 --> 02:22.168
A month ago.

02:23.476 --> 02:27.625
How did he torture you every
day if he was in Venezuela?

02:29.093 --> 02:30.796
You tell them that Cade held you captive

02:30.836 --> 02:33.147
and tortured you, and
that you just escaped.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.203
That psychopath locked
me in a four-by-four hole

02:37.267 --> 02:39.207
with no light, no clock,

02:39.242 --> 02:41.632
no way of keeping track of time.

02:41.685 --> 02:42.972
I was in and out of consciousness,

02:43.007 --> 02:45.584
so if he left for a few days,
I would not have noticed.

02:45.639 --> 02:48.588
His travel arrangements were one-way.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.168
So, he went to one of your known associates

02:52.215 --> 02:55.492
to try to get away from you, and
that's not raising a red flag?

02:56.029 --> 02:59.129
Sounds to me like he was trying
to throw you off his scent.

03:01.555 --> 03:03.702
Is that why you brought me here?

03:03.735 --> 03:05.705
Because if there's nothing else,

03:05.752 --> 03:08.512
I need to get back before the
FBI starts asking where I am.

03:08.547 --> 03:10.448
You're not going back.

03:11.478 --> 03:13.597
We need you to do something first.

03:32.860 --> 03:34.693
(sighs)

03:38.621 --> 03:40.128
If you want to be a
part of this kid's life,

03:40.202 --> 03:42.929
I will make sure that there
is space for that to happen.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.566
You on for trivia tonight?

03:50.631 --> 03:52.457
Tonight? I can't.

03:52.504 --> 03:54.542
Come on. Who's gonna cover science,

03:54.577 --> 03:56.797
pop culture, nerd stuff.

03:56.832 --> 03:58.647
What about Reade?

03:58.697 --> 04:00.824
We're doomed. Why can't you come?

04:00.859 --> 04:02.634
I just, I have this prior thing.

04:02.691 --> 04:05.554
It's just like a meeting, really.

04:05.616 --> 04:07.186
Like a date?

04:07.241 --> 04:08.735
Would you like to have dinner with me?

04:08.770 --> 04:09.849
No. No, no, no, no.

04:09.884 --> 04:11.017
It's not a date. It's more like a...

04:11.052 --> 04:13.298
a friendly meeting with a friend.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.083
- A friend meeting.
- Uh-huh.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.483
(Tasha) Excuse me...

04:19.543 --> 04:21.158
Who told you to take that down?

04:21.208 --> 04:23.807
I'm just doing what it
says on the work order.

04:23.929 --> 04:25.373
So, we're just supposed
to erase her legacy,

04:25.408 --> 04:27.275
like she never existed?

04:32.842 --> 04:34.442
I can't get a hold of Jane.

04:34.516 --> 04:35.992
Can you track her cell?

04:36.060 --> 04:38.105
Keeps going to voice mail.

04:38.167 --> 04:41.223
Oh, her phone's switched off. Hang on.

04:41.558 --> 04:42.850
I can't access it remotely.

04:42.885 --> 04:44.265
She must have removed her battery.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.875
Or someone else did.

04:46.747 --> 04:48.473
What are you doing?

04:48.525 --> 04:50.147
I'm gonna send some
agents to her safe house.

04:50.182 --> 04:51.293
Put the phone down.

04:51.328 --> 04:53.702
- Excuse me?
- Put down the phone!

04:53.761 --> 04:55.987
Chances are, she's been
picked up by Sandstorm.

04:56.022 --> 04:57.114
That doesn't concern you?

04:57.149 --> 04:59.301
Jane is doing the job
that we asked her to do.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.975
It's the paradigm now. We can't sit there

05:01.023 --> 05:03.650
spending resources chasing after her
every time she doesn't punch in on time.

05:03.707 --> 05:05.530
I'm talking about sending
agents to her safe house.

05:05.592 --> 05:08.141
Yeah, which might be enough to
blow her cover with Sandstorm.

05:08.188 --> 05:09.812
Those people are cold-blooded killers.

05:09.873 --> 05:12.672
A fact we all knew getting
into this, especially Jane.

05:12.707 --> 05:15.227
She was the one who insisted
on removing all of our trackers.

05:15.305 --> 05:16.712
Whether we like it or not,

05:16.803 --> 05:19.076
she's on her own.

05:19.111 --> 05:22.912
(lights humming)

05:27.138 --> 05:29.027
(Jane) There's enough for an army in here.

05:29.082 --> 05:30.151
Exactly.

05:30.186 --> 05:32.628
But today, we just need the basics.

05:33.793 --> 05:35.001
Who's this?

05:35.062 --> 05:37.736
Our op, Jeffrey Kantor.

05:37.793 --> 05:40.097
Mechanical engineer at Bradley Dynamics.

05:40.159 --> 05:41.816
- He's an asset.
- He was.

05:41.851 --> 05:44.335
He was supposed to clone
a piece of tech for us.

05:44.370 --> 05:45.932
Something we need for phase two.

05:45.992 --> 05:47.813
But, he missed the drop.

05:47.886 --> 05:50.353
Now we're not sure if
we can trust him anymore.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.454
What was he supposed to clone?

05:54.489 --> 05:56.422
- A microchip.
- (bag zipping)

05:57.912 --> 06:00.605
Wait... I recruited him.

06:00.663 --> 06:01.828
Yeah.

06:02.241 --> 06:04.585
He was in love with you.

06:04.663 --> 06:06.394
That explains why he got cold feet...

06:06.472 --> 06:08.622
'cause I went off the radar.

06:08.715 --> 06:10.745
We tried to replace his handler.

06:10.780 --> 06:13.418
Turns out, there's no replacing you.

06:13.463 --> 06:16.498
You've always been good at
getting people to do what you want.

06:17.132 --> 06:19.138
That's why we sent you to Weller.

06:22.509 --> 06:24.143
How'd it go with Freddy last night?

06:24.213 --> 06:26.089
We just couldn't find enough
victims to come forward.

06:26.163 --> 06:27.803
Why aren't you testifying?

06:29.518 --> 06:30.603
Fine.

06:30.638 --> 06:31.705
Glad to hear it.

06:31.772 --> 06:33.470
Hope you've been hitting
those science textbooks.

06:33.535 --> 06:35.381
Patterson can't make it to trivia tonight.

06:35.420 --> 06:36.494
Yeah, sure.

06:36.529 --> 06:37.908
Should we be waiting on Jane?

06:37.986 --> 06:40.571
- No.
- She'll catch up when she gets here.

06:40.606 --> 06:41.918
Okay.

06:41.953 --> 06:43.593
I'm sure you all heard
about the bomb that went off

06:43.654 --> 06:45.259
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard this morning.

06:45.294 --> 06:47.312
Four are dead and eleven were injured.

06:47.347 --> 06:50.135
The bomb released thousands
of particles of micro-shrapnel.

06:50.208 --> 06:53.540
NYPD found traces of
tungsten, nickel, and cobalt.

06:53.575 --> 06:54.720
I read about these.

06:54.779 --> 06:57.097
Dense inert metal explosives.

06:57.152 --> 06:58.477
Also known as DIME bombs,

06:58.525 --> 07:00.941
which is where the tattoo
connection comes in.

07:01.015 --> 07:03.793
An olive branch, an
oak branch, and a torch.

07:03.863 --> 07:05.706
Where else do we see these three together?

07:05.770 --> 07:07.713
- The U.S. dime.
- Precisely.

07:07.769 --> 07:10.344
And the outline is in the shape of Vieques,

07:10.408 --> 07:13.610
a Puerto Rican island the Navy
used as a weapons testing site.

07:13.673 --> 07:15.384
Yeah, but the Navy shut
down testing in Vieques

07:15.431 --> 07:17.080
when the cancer rate started to skyrocket.

07:17.153 --> 07:19.214
Well, that's the public story.

07:19.292 --> 07:21.212
The Navy still tests
off-book weapons there,

07:21.284 --> 07:22.239
including DIME bombs.

07:22.293 --> 07:26.090
Then, the tattoo was probably trying
to expose these secret weapons tests.

07:26.149 --> 07:28.661
So, what is one of these DIME bombs
doing in the middle of Brooklyn?

07:28.696 --> 07:33.106
(phones chirping, vibrating)

07:33.174 --> 07:34.689
Another bomb went off in Midtown.

07:34.724 --> 07:35.881
At least ten dead.

07:35.940 --> 07:37.417
It's a coordinated attack.

07:37.475 --> 07:39.308
This might be just the beginning.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.724
So, what happens when we find Jeffrey?

07:45.759 --> 07:48.694
Suss him out, see if
we can still trust him?

07:48.767 --> 07:51.291
Jeffrey is not the only
one we're worried about.

07:51.979 --> 07:53.439
You need to prove you're still one of us.

07:53.478 --> 07:54.273
"One of you"?

07:54.317 --> 07:56.029
I helped design this whole plan.

07:56.087 --> 07:57.614
You're different now.

07:58.282 --> 08:00.000
We all feel it.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.853
Those drugs changed you.

08:03.514 --> 08:05.416
Yeah, of course they did.

08:05.451 --> 08:06.970
I mean, wasn't that the point?

08:07.057 --> 08:08.316
To erase my memory?

08:08.351 --> 08:12.076
Yes, so the FBI would
trust you, and it worked.

08:12.193 --> 08:13.413
But now that you're back,

08:13.488 --> 08:16.116
we need to be able to trust you again.

08:16.151 --> 08:19.615
If we can't... something needs to change.

08:19.650 --> 08:22.870
So, that's what this is... a test?

08:22.905 --> 08:25.413
Call it what you want.

08:25.448 --> 08:28.198
We need you to kill Jeffrey Kantor.

08:47.774 --> 08:49.742
You can take the bag off now.

08:54.031 --> 08:56.397
I thought she'd be happier
to have her daughter back.

08:56.432 --> 08:58.027
Oh, she is.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.658
But, this mission is
bigger than any one life.

09:00.693 --> 09:03.087
Yours, mine... Jeffrey's.

09:03.135 --> 09:04.588
Roman, this man is innocent.

09:04.623 --> 09:07.564
You might not realize
it yet, but we're at war.

09:07.661 --> 09:10.125
And in war, people die.

09:10.199 --> 09:13.211
I just don't believe our
only option is to kill him.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.287
When we were in that orphanage,

09:16.414 --> 09:19.224
the caretakers gave us each a rabbit.

09:19.631 --> 09:22.068
You fed them, cared for them,

09:22.140 --> 09:23.864
grew to love them.

09:24.094 --> 09:27.029
And one day, they ordered us to kill them.

09:27.125 --> 09:28.926
We were just kids.

09:29.616 --> 09:30.947
I couldn't do it.

09:31.001 --> 09:32.668
What did I do?

09:32.748 --> 09:36.345
You snapped its neck quicker
than any kid in there.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.449
You can do this.

09:40.484 --> 09:42.048
It's who you are.

09:45.394 --> 09:48.031
(Patterson) The second bomb
went off in a much denser area.

09:48.082 --> 09:49.675
The death count is up to 22.

09:49.722 --> 09:50.972
The first bomb was at the Navy yard,

09:51.000 --> 09:53.152
the second was outside a USO office.

09:53.207 --> 09:54.678
Both symbolic military locations.

09:54.713 --> 09:57.288
Payback, for the Navy's testing in Vieques?

09:57.351 --> 09:58.176
(Zapata) I got something.

09:58.218 --> 10:01.042
Two men exited the cab just
before the first bomb went off.

10:01.118 --> 10:04.046
The same two guys can be seen at
the second location minutes before

10:04.085 --> 10:05.846
- that explosion.
- It's not much to go on.

10:05.881 --> 10:07.599
They're looking down to avoid the cameras.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.383
Reade, I want you to get
these screen grabs up,

10:09.454 --> 10:11.044
then keep looking for different angles.

10:11.079 --> 10:13.500
Patterson, cross-reference
Vieques residential records

10:13.545 --> 10:14.981
with anyone in New York right now.

10:15.016 --> 10:16.186
And let's check social media too.

10:16.237 --> 10:17.858
Someone might be claiming credit.

10:17.893 --> 10:19.580
These guys might strike
again at any minute,

10:19.615 --> 10:21.107
so let's work fast and try and stop them

10:21.142 --> 10:22.574
before they set off another bomb.

10:22.626 --> 10:23.867
Move.

10:25.255 --> 10:26.230
Tasha,

10:26.309 --> 10:28.468
I want you to get me the casualty
list from both of those bomb sites.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.988
Why, what do y...

10:31.314 --> 10:32.762
You think Jane was one of them?

10:32.825 --> 10:35.125
It's a city of eight million people.

10:35.203 --> 10:38.244
- The probability of...
- Just get me the lists, please.

10:46.476 --> 10:48.109
Hey, Remy, you made it!

10:49.524 --> 10:50.862
I've been here before.

10:50.897 --> 10:54.208
Many times, while you
were cultivating Jeffrey.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.509
There was an older man too.

10:55.567 --> 10:56.869
White hair, balding?

10:56.904 --> 11:00.294
Jeffrey's boss. You killed him.

11:00.366 --> 11:02.256
You had to so Jeffrey could take his place

11:02.340 --> 11:04.686
and get a higher security clearance.

11:04.776 --> 11:06.340
We couldn't just get him fired?

11:06.375 --> 11:07.455
Those people are the enemy.

11:07.490 --> 11:09.490
It's not our job to protect them.

11:10.804 --> 11:14.547
So, everyone you've killed
has been an enemy to the cause.

11:14.641 --> 11:18.890
If a few innocents have to die
to save this country from tyranny,

11:18.957 --> 11:20.993
I'd say that's a price worth paying.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.314
Wouldn't you?

11:23.024 --> 11:24.124
(lock clicking)

11:26.704 --> 11:28.223
Lead the way.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.577
He'll want to see your face first.

11:34.870 --> 11:35.869
(panting)

11:36.019 --> 11:37.365
Jeffrey!

11:40.509 --> 11:41.608
(keypad beeping)

11:45.405 --> 11:47.032
He has a panic room?

11:47.093 --> 11:49.563
He was a paranoid guy
long before we got to him.

11:49.613 --> 11:52.367
Jeffrey, we just want to talk to you.

11:52.659 --> 11:54.386
Sure. That's why you brought

11:54.441 --> 11:56.725
your maniac brother, right? To talk?

11:58.827 --> 12:00.593
- (beeping)
- _

12:04.441 --> 12:06.699
No, we're not there yet.

12:06.701 --> 12:08.854
I want the National Guard put on stand-by.

12:08.907 --> 12:10.520
I need someone to contact
the mayor's office.

12:10.596 --> 12:14.374
I'm trying to figure out why he hasn't
declared a state of emergency yet.

12:14.448 --> 12:16.843
I know this isn't what you wanted, but...

12:17.506 --> 12:19.520
Mayfair would be glad
that you're in that chair.

12:20.883 --> 12:22.851
Is that a casualty list?

12:24.022 --> 12:25.986
No one matching Jane's description.

12:27.618 --> 12:29.255
Talk to Reade.

12:29.372 --> 12:32.692
He's been coordinating with the
NYPD on the eyewitness reports.

12:35.242 --> 12:36.497
Are you worried she's been taken,

12:36.586 --> 12:38.953
or are you worried she's been turned?

12:41.769 --> 12:43.614
Let me know what Reade says.

12:44.539 --> 12:45.972
(man) We're on the premises now.

12:47.548 --> 12:48.748
Body.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.515
(grunting and fighting)

13:06.394 --> 13:08.728
- (gun cocking)
- No.

13:08.795 --> 13:10.485
If we want to coax Jeffrey
out of that panic room,

13:10.546 --> 13:11.898
killing these guys won't help.

13:11.933 --> 13:14.167
(panting)

13:21.714 --> 13:23.443
(Jeffrey, muffled) I've got
food and water to last a month

13:23.502 --> 13:24.511
and more security on their way.

13:24.556 --> 13:26.128
We're not here to hurt you.

13:26.183 --> 13:28.170
We're worried about you.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.783
Where have you been?

13:29.882 --> 13:31.660
You said you'd be gone for a little while.

13:31.720 --> 13:33.895
Y-You didn't say you'd be gone for months.

13:33.933 --> 13:37.085
My op took longer than I thought.

13:37.181 --> 13:39.245
Why did you miss your meet, Jeffrey?

13:40.829 --> 13:43.429
I-I can't do this anymore.

13:43.566 --> 13:46.584
All this lying, pretending
to be someone I'm not.

13:46.670 --> 13:49.135
I'm not sleeping. I'm not eating.

13:49.271 --> 13:52.039
I can't keep living this double life.

13:53.545 --> 13:55.272
You're not living a double life.

13:55.329 --> 13:57.504
You're finally becoming
what you're meant to be.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.812
This is so much bigger than all of us.

13:59.814 --> 14:01.681
No, no, no. I know how your group

14:01.683 --> 14:04.272
treats people they don't trust!

14:04.323 --> 14:06.623
Think about this logically.

14:06.764 --> 14:08.917
You're too valuable to us.

14:09.009 --> 14:12.170
(Jane) We still need the microchip,
and we cannot do that without you.

14:12.205 --> 14:15.058
This is an opportunity
to prove that we can still

14:15.124 --> 14:18.392
trust each other. Okay?

14:19.668 --> 14:21.746
Open the door, Jeffrey.

14:23.138 --> 14:26.959
Or, just stay in there. Stay safe.

14:29.946 --> 14:31.612
And stay frightened.

14:34.316 --> 14:36.950
(beeping, door unlocks)

14:42.688 --> 14:45.558
I'm so sorry. I didn't know...

14:45.560 --> 14:47.894
(Jeffrey thuds to floor)

14:47.896 --> 14:49.517
Good work.

14:53.804 --> 14:56.702
Wait. I think I've got something.

14:57.427 --> 14:59.205
Check out these tweets.

14:59.281 --> 15:01.264
7:11 A.M. "This is for David Sanes."

15:01.317 --> 15:03.343
8:53 A.M., "This is for Milivi Adams."

15:03.378 --> 15:05.278
Alleged victims of the Vieques testing.

15:05.348 --> 15:07.513
Okay, so the bombers are
dedicating their attacks.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.549
These tweets are stamped
with the exact time

15:09.551 --> 15:10.973
and location of the bombings.

15:11.023 --> 15:12.887
I can track their IP addresses.

15:12.951 --> 15:15.115
Yeah, but that'll only get
us their previous locations.

15:15.151 --> 15:17.515
We need to find out where
they're heading to next.

15:18.053 --> 15:19.425
Wait a second.

15:19.582 --> 15:22.052
You really think these guys stuck
around the bomb sites to tweet?

15:22.087 --> 15:25.100
No, they must have preloaded
their messages on a timer.

15:25.135 --> 15:28.134
So, if we can hack into
their preloaded tweets,

15:28.291 --> 15:30.536
we can see the next
location of their attack.

15:30.538 --> 15:33.306
And stop it before it goes off.

15:33.308 --> 15:34.474
(Jeffrey grunting)

15:47.956 --> 15:48.955
(gun cocks)

15:48.957 --> 15:50.623
(Jeffrey whimpering)

15:56.264 --> 15:57.964
Do it.

16:03.738 --> 16:05.705
We still need this microchip.

16:07.601 --> 16:10.977
So, if we kill him,
we're back at square one.

16:11.046 --> 16:13.179
The smart move is to put him back in play.

16:13.258 --> 16:15.458
Do you really think he's
gonna betray us after this?

16:17.764 --> 16:20.432
Look me in the eye and tell me I'm wrong.

16:24.865 --> 16:26.197
Maybe you're right.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.396
(Jeffrey grunts)

16:31.276 --> 16:33.640
But that is not why we're here.

16:34.086 --> 16:37.387
Shepherd needed to see
that you were still you.

16:39.269 --> 16:40.602
And you just failed.

16:40.675 --> 16:43.882
♪♪

16:53.344 --> 16:55.536
Head back to the city.

16:55.606 --> 16:57.563
If this pager goes off,

16:57.598 --> 16:59.323
wait on the bench on the southeast corner

16:59.391 --> 17:02.574
of Wallabout Bay. Someone will pick you up.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.790
What are you going to tell Shepherd?

17:09.162 --> 17:12.564
♪♪

17:23.175 --> 17:25.087
That's unacceptable. These
bombers are still out here.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.397
I'm gonna wait by this phone, you're
gonna call me back in two minutes

17:27.472 --> 17:28.496
with a different answer.

17:28.563 --> 17:31.190
I got your e-mail. Did you
still want to talk to me?

17:31.241 --> 17:33.441
Uh, yeah, um...

17:35.489 --> 17:38.189
What can you tell me
about repressed memories?

17:38.191 --> 17:40.734
Ah, well, that's a complicated subject.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.242
What did you want to know?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.236
I-I'm not sure, actually.

17:45.271 --> 17:46.349
Today's crazy, so...

17:46.384 --> 17:48.886
Well, it sounds like we
at least have two minutes.

17:48.967 --> 17:50.747
So, briefly, repressed memories

17:50.782 --> 17:53.132
are the brain's way of
processing serious trauma.

17:53.184 --> 17:55.807
Something horrible happens,
and the mind pushes it

17:55.849 --> 17:58.036
to a hidden corner of the subconscious.

17:58.616 --> 18:00.682
But the memory still exists somewhere.

18:00.735 --> 18:01.872
They can be recovered, right?

18:01.939 --> 18:04.873
In theory, with professional psychotherapy.

18:04.908 --> 18:07.945
But digging them up can often cause anger,

18:07.980 --> 18:10.046
depression, PTSD.

18:12.096 --> 18:14.293
Is it better to leave them alone?

18:14.381 --> 18:16.200
Not necessarily.

18:16.279 --> 18:18.055
Think of it like dental surgery.

18:18.141 --> 18:20.368
The process is painful, but...

18:20.426 --> 18:22.336
ignoring the problem is often much worse.

18:22.371 --> 18:24.427
(softly) Yeah.

18:24.506 --> 18:26.898
Look... is this about Jane?

18:28.102 --> 18:30.080
No, this is... for another case.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.711
Uh, this has been
helpful, though, thank you.

18:32.746 --> 18:37.941
Well, if you ever want a more detailed
consultation on this, um, case...

18:38.075 --> 18:39.775
my door's always open.

18:43.497 --> 18:47.083
(phone ringing)

18:47.140 --> 18:48.152
Reade.

18:49.688 --> 18:50.920
Lock the door.

18:57.238 --> 18:58.991
Hey, that's twice as big as the last one.

18:59.057 --> 19:00.918
We're trying to send a message, aren't we?

19:00.953 --> 19:02.820
I think we've sent it.

19:02.868 --> 19:04.634
There's no turning back now.

19:04.806 --> 19:07.303
We have to finish what we started.

19:07.492 --> 19:09.142
For Nora and Camilla.

19:18.194 --> 19:20.680
Jane! Jane, where have you been?

19:20.715 --> 19:22.123
You okay?

19:22.216 --> 19:25.551
We need to talk in the annex, now.

19:27.689 --> 19:30.160
It was a loyalty test, and I failed.

19:30.268 --> 19:31.151
I'm burnt.

19:31.217 --> 19:33.602
You should have taken that shot.

19:34.199 --> 19:35.659
Roman's right, this is a war.

19:35.694 --> 19:38.058
Sandstorm's stated goal
is to burn this country

19:38.093 --> 19:40.573
down to the ground, and you might
be our only hope at stopping them.

19:40.608 --> 19:42.935
He was asking me to kill
a completely innocent man.

19:42.970 --> 19:45.094
One man, whose life you valued

19:45.137 --> 19:47.435
over the thousands Sandstorm
could eventually take out.

19:47.505 --> 19:49.727
- She is not a killer.
- Yes, she is a killer!

19:49.785 --> 19:52.089
That's why they want her, and
that's why we sent her there.

19:52.167 --> 19:55.122
You do whatever you have to
do to maintain your cover.

19:56.233 --> 19:57.686
I know where the next bomb is going off.

19:57.723 --> 19:59.510
Oh, uh, two bombers are in the city...

19:59.556 --> 20:00.877
They already filled me in.

20:00.965 --> 20:01.910
(Patterson) Okay, I hacked into

20:01.945 --> 20:03.977
the bombers' accounts and
found their preloaded tweets.

20:04.041 --> 20:05.701
Looks like they have more
attacks planned for today.

20:05.783 --> 20:07.182
(Weller) So, where is the
next bomb set to go off?

20:07.240 --> 20:09.455
- Prospect Park, in 20 minutes.
- Get Reade and Tasha.

20:09.531 --> 20:11.837
No, you stay here. Just regroup.

20:11.872 --> 20:13.415
Naz will debrief you about
your time with Sandstorm.

20:13.496 --> 20:15.551
No, she's coming with you.
I can debrief her later.

20:15.586 --> 20:16.562
She's not fit to be out
in the field right now.

20:16.612 --> 20:18.134
She can't just sit one out!

20:18.169 --> 20:20.105
Things have to appear business as usual.

20:20.159 --> 20:21.430
I can do this.

20:21.498 --> 20:23.458
Kurt, I'm fine.

20:23.516 --> 20:25.149

20:47.139 --> 20:48.670
If these guys are still here,

20:48.763 --> 20:50.847
it could risk spooking them.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.308
Reade, Tasha...

20:52.310 --> 20:53.920
take that north side of the plaza.

<i>Secure that bomb before
the other one sets it off.</i>

23:20.792 --> 23:22.525
Did it work?

23:23.962 --> 23:26.889
Well, we're not dead,
so I'm gonna say it did.

23:32.537 --> 23:35.445
(Jane) I lost him. He's in the wind.

23:42.001 --> 23:43.244
(Weller) This is all on you.

23:43.279 --> 23:44.478
She should never have been out there.

23:44.513 --> 23:45.964
She said she was up for it.

23:45.999 --> 23:48.439
You haven't exactly created an environment
where she can say anything else.

23:48.474 --> 23:50.374
(indistinct arguing)

23:51.904 --> 23:52.778
(scoffs)

23:52.813 --> 23:53.576
She should have stayed in position

23:53.611 --> 23:55.582
and waited for backup.
If it wasn't for Weller,

23:55.617 --> 23:57.118
she would have gotten herself killed.

23:57.181 --> 24:00.513
She's saved both of our
lives, more than once.

24:01.020 --> 24:03.950
Admit it, she's not as
sharp as she used to be.

24:05.582 --> 24:07.635
After all the hell she's been through...

24:09.040 --> 24:10.817
I'd be the same way.

24:12.765 --> 24:14.816
What's going on?

24:14.887 --> 24:16.810
What happened with Freddy last night?

24:17.823 --> 24:19.470
Nothing, I told you, it went fine.

24:19.537 --> 24:21.914
- Then why are you acting like some...
- Can you just leave something alone

24:21.982 --> 24:23.566
for once in your life?

24:24.050 --> 24:25.787
It's not your problem.

24:31.020 --> 24:32.812
Both of those guys should
have been in custody.

24:32.847 --> 24:34.137
They're not. One is dead,

24:34.182 --> 24:35.066
one is still out there.

24:35.101 --> 24:36.557
Look, we know where his next targets are.

24:36.615 --> 24:38.184
We've got all of the NYPD out there.

24:38.219 --> 24:39.229
That is not the point!

24:39.292 --> 24:41.736
You need to put aside your
past baggage with Jane.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.841
All right? She's a key member of this team.

24:43.876 --> 24:45.760
This isn't baggage, all right?

24:45.823 --> 24:46.983
I know Jane.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.382
I know her strengths and her weaknesses.

24:49.423 --> 24:50.930
And the sooner you start learning that,

24:50.965 --> 24:53.399
the better this will all work out.

24:53.434 --> 24:54.225
(door opens)

24:54.302 --> 24:56.002
We've located the second bomber.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.706
So, the bombers preloaded ten tweets.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.330
Nine of them had locations,

25:02.371 --> 25:05.260
and the last one had a link
to a Periscope video feed.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.209
That feed just went live.

25:07.261 --> 25:09.367
This is a Navy recruitment
center in Queens,

25:09.402 --> 25:10.716
and he has eight hostages.

25:10.751 --> 25:13.285
- (man) Say your prayers! Get down!
- NYPD is on their way now.

25:13.287 --> 25:17.390
(speaking native language)

25:17.392 --> 25:18.453
That's the "Our Father."

25:18.496 --> 25:20.029
And that's a suicide vest.

25:20.064 --> 25:22.064
He's got enough explosives
to level the place.

25:22.096 --> 25:24.063
Let's move. We've gotta get over there now.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.766
Sit this one out, Jane.

25:26.845 --> 25:28.978
- No, I can do this.
- Yeah, I know you can,

25:29.013 --> 25:30.483
but you don't have to. We got this.

25:30.518 --> 25:32.938
- Kurt, I don't need you to...
- Just get your head straight.

25:33.025 --> 25:34.747
Reevaluate when we get back.

25:35.830 --> 25:36.986
(Jane) This is crazy.

25:37.030 --> 25:39.193
New York is under attack.
I should be out there.

25:39.237 --> 25:42.615
I understand it's frustrating not
to be with your team right now.

25:42.801 --> 25:45.017
We haven't really spoken
much since your return.

25:45.062 --> 25:47.138
Tell me, what's on your mind these days?

25:52.627 --> 25:55.502
Do you think there's such
a thing as killer instinct?

25:55.537 --> 25:58.655
You mean, do I think some people are
genetically predisposed to violence?

25:58.690 --> 26:01.219
Mm-hmm. Genetically or...

26:01.693 --> 26:03.659
taught from a young age.

26:04.006 --> 26:05.106
Well, some studies have suggested

26:05.195 --> 26:07.387
that the brain can be
hardwired toward violence.

26:07.422 --> 26:08.853
- Why do you ask?
- Because every time

26:08.888 --> 26:12.193
I raise a gun, there's a...

26:12.228 --> 26:15.606
a small part of me, this urge,

26:15.655 --> 26:17.755
from somewhere deep inside to...

26:19.580 --> 26:21.151
to pull the trigger.

26:24.776 --> 26:26.325
You think I'm deranged.

26:26.327 --> 26:27.929
Not at all.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.658
Whatever impulses you're experiencing,

26:29.721 --> 26:31.587
your conscience is overruling them.

26:31.699 --> 26:34.377
Yeah, but the impulse is still
there. How do I get rid of that?

26:34.412 --> 26:36.779
Thought and action are two separate things.

26:36.838 --> 26:38.405
We can't always control our impulses.

26:38.486 --> 26:40.782
What's important is what we do with them.

26:40.843 --> 26:42.819
Have faith that your moral compass

26:42.893 --> 26:44.956
will steer you in the right direction.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.550
(indistinct radio chatter, guns cocking)

26:53.521 --> 26:54.987
(Weller) Hold on.

26:54.989 --> 26:57.223
Can I get a direct line
to the hostage taker?

26:58.073 --> 26:59.012
Darrel...

26:59.047 --> 27:00.460
<i>this is Kurt Weller,</i>

27:00.495 --> 27:02.340
<i>Assistant Director with the FBI.</i>

27:02.383 --> 27:04.772
No one else needs to get hurt today.

27:04.826 --> 27:08.466
Let the hostages go,
and we can keep talking.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.838
(Darrel) <i>These people
are not innocents.</i>

27:11.934 --> 27:15.675
The blood of countless
Viequins is on their hands.

27:15.717 --> 27:19.169
None of the people in that office
had anything to do with those tests.

27:19.214 --> 27:21.747
Their silence is complicity!

27:21.867 --> 27:23.589
And now, the whole world

27:23.624 --> 27:25.393
<i>will get to watch them die.</i>

27:25.474 --> 27:26.750
(Weller) We shut down your feed.

27:26.805 --> 27:29.042
My team and I are the only ones watching.

27:31.292 --> 27:33.459
You shouldn't have done that!

27:33.461 --> 27:36.428
(woman whimpering)

27:37.259 --> 27:38.464
He's off.

27:39.852 --> 27:40.890
What are you doing?

27:40.935 --> 27:42.583
This guy's completely unstable.

27:43.271 --> 27:45.804
Well, I'd better not screw this up.

27:45.806 --> 27:46.872
Hold the perimeter.

27:46.874 --> 27:48.841
(indistinct radio chatter)

27:50.044 --> 27:51.076
Hold your fire.

27:51.078 --> 27:53.112
Hold your fire!

27:58.274 --> 27:59.712
Darrel!

28:00.364 --> 28:03.556
Kurt Weller, the FBI.

28:03.591 --> 28:05.340
Just coming in to talk to you.

28:05.409 --> 28:06.909
Just to talk.

28:08.963 --> 28:11.030
(indistinct radio chatter)

28:14.268 --> 28:16.050
Take that off, put this on.

28:16.120 --> 28:17.448
Listen to me, Darrel,

28:17.605 --> 28:19.835
I just want to talk, okay?

28:19.908 --> 28:22.600
Take that off, put this on, now!

28:22.665 --> 28:24.877
Put that on, or we all die.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.373
♪♪

28:46.427 --> 28:48.822
Stay where you are, or we all die.

28:48.924 --> 28:52.404
Darrel, I don't think
that you want to die today.

28:52.462 --> 28:54.972
Otherwise, you would have
already detonated this vest.

28:56.793 --> 28:59.440
Why did you do this?

28:59.510 --> 29:03.483
My sister, Nora... she died last year.

29:03.568 --> 29:05.497
Cancer!

29:05.532 --> 29:09.473
Jose, he lost his daughter.

29:09.546 --> 29:12.136
These weapons tests devastated Viequis!

29:12.171 --> 29:12.895
(detonator cover clicking)

29:12.942 --> 29:15.152
(Weller) That is awful.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.104
So, what do you want?

29:16.139 --> 29:19.365
I want the president
to officially apologize.

29:19.425 --> 29:22.315
And I want the people
responsible to go to prison!

29:22.385 --> 29:23.862
- I can work on that.
- You're lying!

29:23.897 --> 29:27.180
Killing more innocent people,
that is not the answer.

29:27.259 --> 29:29.663
My parents died when I was just a boy.

29:29.710 --> 29:31.458
My sister raised me.

29:31.493 --> 29:34.849
After she died, I had no one.

29:34.884 --> 29:36.798
Think about those people back there.

29:37.858 --> 29:39.975
Think about their sisters,

29:40.882 --> 29:45.049
their brothers... parents.

29:45.084 --> 29:47.938
Think about their children.

29:48.056 --> 29:49.636
Think about that.

29:54.438 --> 29:56.905
This is not the answer, Darrel.

29:57.015 --> 29:58.026
It's not the way...

29:58.075 --> 30:00.209
(gunshots)

30:02.079 --> 30:04.434
(glass breaking)

30:04.469 --> 30:06.449
Who fired those shots?

30:12.948 --> 30:14.696
Who told you to take those shots?

30:14.762 --> 30:15.958
And what should I have done?

30:15.993 --> 30:17.413
Radioed in and asked
your permission if I could

30:17.448 --> 30:19.156
take the shot in the
two-second window I had?

30:19.196 --> 30:20.387
I was getting through to him.

30:20.422 --> 30:21.703
That guy's life was over even before

30:21.738 --> 30:22.850
- you went in there.
- With little more time,

30:22.912 --> 30:24.149
- I would have had him in cuffs.
- Yeah?

30:24.184 --> 30:25.501
Well, I wasn't willing to take that risk.

30:25.536 --> 30:26.897
What if you'd missed?

30:26.959 --> 30:28.937
- I didn't.
- You could have.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.020
You and I, we need to start
functioning like a team.

30:31.075 --> 30:33.602
And, we are. That's why I took the shot.

30:33.637 --> 30:35.760
I didn't risk your life to
take out a suspect, okay?

30:35.795 --> 30:38.227
I took out a suspect because
your life was at risk.

30:38.297 --> 30:40.753
You of all people should understand that.

30:40.831 --> 30:42.640
My only priority is to protect my team,

30:42.677 --> 30:45.278
and in the same situation, I'd do it again.

30:53.631 --> 30:57.066
(Borden speaking Arabic)

31:00.457 --> 31:02.371
Were you just speaking Arabic?

31:02.476 --> 31:04.388
No, why do you ask that?

31:04.423 --> 31:06.065
Because you were just speaking Arabic.

31:06.100 --> 31:08.243
(chuckling) I think you're mistaken.

31:08.519 --> 31:09.468
Okay.

31:09.546 --> 31:12.860
Uh, listen, today was insane,

31:12.934 --> 31:14.984
and I have a billion
after-action reports to...

31:15.019 --> 31:18.387
Oh, it's okay. We can reschedule.

31:18.494 --> 31:20.189
Okay. I mean, now that we caught the guys,

31:20.253 --> 31:22.406
things should calm down soon.

31:22.441 --> 31:24.774
Well, I'm free all weekend.

31:26.055 --> 31:28.530
Oh, uh, this weekend.

31:28.532 --> 31:31.304
This weekend, uh...

31:31.359 --> 31:33.735
it's not great. We're updating our systems.

31:33.737 --> 31:36.772
You know I'm a therapist, right?

31:36.852 --> 31:38.794
I know what a blow-off looks like.

31:40.841 --> 31:42.298
I'm... (chuckling)

31:42.333 --> 31:44.165
I'm not blowing you off.

31:44.247 --> 31:46.245
Next week, for sure.

31:46.846 --> 31:48.455
Next week sounds great.

31:48.526 --> 31:49.629
Okay.

31:50.721 --> 31:52.879
That was definitely Arabic, though.

31:52.957 --> 31:54.509
If you say so.

31:57.962 --> 32:00.719
(Jane, on recording) <i>Do you think
there's such a thing as killer instinct?</i>

32:00.781 --> 32:03.851
(Borden) <i>You mean, do I think some people
are genetically predisposed to violence?</i>

32:03.901 --> 32:05.665
<i>Mm-hmm. Genetically, or...</i>

32:05.713 --> 32:07.009
<i>taught from a young age.</i>

32:07.074 --> 32:10.006
Hey, can I show you something
I've been working on?

32:10.774 --> 32:12.241
Good news or bad?

32:12.243 --> 32:14.610
Uh, it's a little of both, I guess.

32:14.698 --> 32:16.679
Mm, I'm intrigued. Lead the way.

32:16.788 --> 32:18.048
Okay, so...

32:18.082 --> 32:20.124
I finally got a second to dig into

32:20.184 --> 32:22.676
Sandstorm's engineer asset, Jeffrey Kantor.

32:22.711 --> 32:25.728
Roman said that Kantor was supposed
to clone a microchip for them.

32:25.768 --> 32:27.656
He worked for Bradley Dynamics,

32:27.658 --> 32:31.593
which is one of those companies that
has its hands in just about everything.

32:31.690 --> 32:33.700
His job title was never disclosed,

32:33.764 --> 32:37.844
but I'm pretty sure he
worked in aeronautics.

32:38.557 --> 32:40.012
Yeah, interesting.

32:40.047 --> 32:42.644
That lines up with a few theories
that I've been working on.

32:42.730 --> 32:44.238
Could you find out his focus area?

32:44.278 --> 32:48.386
Well, based on his PhD focus
and previous employment,

32:48.421 --> 32:50.682
I'd say he was working on smart weapons,

32:50.741 --> 32:53.380
laser guidance, or
missile and fire control.

32:53.415 --> 32:55.008
Or, all of those.

32:55.043 --> 32:56.836
Or something much, much worse.

32:56.871 --> 33:00.272
Roman said that this tech
was crucial to phase two.

33:00.424 --> 33:02.532
If he killed Kantor, they must have

33:02.618 --> 33:04.234
some other way to get
their hands on that chip.

33:04.269 --> 33:06.261
Yeah, and when they do,
they'll be that much closer

33:06.263 --> 33:08.071
to an attack.

33:20.161 --> 33:22.237
One minute, Naz is telling me
to be a killer and the next,

33:22.279 --> 33:25.047
you're sitting me on the
bench for acting like one.

33:25.111 --> 33:27.857
I'm getting pulled in opposite directions.

33:28.819 --> 33:31.320
You're right.

33:31.322 --> 33:33.839
You've been put in an
impossible position, Jane.

33:35.351 --> 33:36.859
So, what do you need?

33:40.188 --> 33:42.692
- I-I don't know.
- (pager vibrating)

33:47.456 --> 33:50.191
It's Roman, he's calling
me back to Sandstorm.

33:50.340 --> 33:51.510
He say why?

33:51.613 --> 33:52.635
No.

33:53.679 --> 33:57.153
But if he spoke to Shepherd... I'm blown.

33:57.188 --> 33:59.535
I could be walking into my own execution.

33:59.574 --> 34:00.983
You don't have to do this.

34:00.985 --> 34:03.139
What are my choices?

34:03.174 --> 34:05.286
I either go back to Sandstorm,

34:05.321 --> 34:06.630
or I go back to the CIA.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.481
- I can talk to Pellington.
- No, I...

34:09.659 --> 34:11.627
I'm still the best shot that we have

34:11.661 --> 34:13.359
at stopping all of this.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.731
I never realized how easy
it was being Taylor Shaw.

34:20.674 --> 34:22.402
This is so much worse.

34:22.489 --> 34:25.072
You're not Taylor Shaw.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.376
And you're not a killer, either.

34:27.483 --> 34:30.846
I don't care what Roman
and Naz have to say.

34:31.009 --> 34:32.581
You know who you are.

34:32.770 --> 34:36.018
You know what you're capable of.

34:36.339 --> 34:38.405
Trust your own instincts.

34:41.460 --> 34:43.132
(Tasha) Oh, good, you're still here.

34:43.212 --> 34:46.473
We're thinking about having a
little thing in Weller's office.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.629
- Something for Mayfair.
- Oh, yeah.

34:48.672 --> 34:51.199
That's... that's great. I... of course.

34:51.253 --> 34:52.511
I thought you had a date

34:52.558 --> 34:54.130
or a... meeting

34:54.204 --> 34:55.971
or whatever we're pretending this is.

34:55.973 --> 34:58.198
Oh, yeah, I cancelled.

34:58.233 --> 34:58.874
Why?

34:58.876 --> 35:02.144
I... I... I'm not very
good at friend meetings,

35:02.146 --> 35:04.204
and they sound like a...

35:04.262 --> 35:05.828
a good idea, but then I
start thinking about them,

35:05.899 --> 35:08.474
and I get a little anxious
and just kind of flustered

35:08.552 --> 35:10.773
- and...
- Start calling them "friend meetings"?

35:10.861 --> 35:12.975
I've also been thinking
a lot about getting a cat.

35:13.025 --> 35:15.369
You just stopped a massive terror attack,

35:15.404 --> 35:18.058
you're one of the smartest,
bravest people I know,

35:18.140 --> 35:21.233
and, uh... you're allergic to cats.

35:21.307 --> 35:22.213
That's true.

35:22.248 --> 35:24.267
Just go on the date.

35:24.897 --> 35:26.239
Okay.

35:38.331 --> 35:39.497
Let's go.

35:41.821 --> 35:43.423
Get in the trunk.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.283
Shepherd wants to see you.

36:13.854 --> 36:17.856
It's not a good feeling wondering
if you can trust your own daughter.

36:22.938 --> 36:25.305
Thank you for taking care of Jeffrey.

36:29.232 --> 36:30.866
I can't imagine...

36:30.914 --> 36:34.082
what you've been through these last months.

36:36.407 --> 36:38.140
It breaks my heart.

36:42.812 --> 36:44.846
Welcome back, Remy.

36:48.814 --> 36:50.714
It's good to be home.

36:52.991 --> 36:55.141
You never had a chance
to say goodbye to Oscar.

36:55.176 --> 36:56.465
I thought...

36:58.011 --> 37:00.712
you might want to say a few words.

37:18.173 --> 37:19.916
This...

37:19.951 --> 37:22.022
still doesn't feel real.

37:25.972 --> 37:28.958
Feels like yesterday...

37:28.993 --> 37:30.651
that we found each other again.

37:30.724 --> 37:33.013
After so much time apart,

37:33.076 --> 37:34.752
I've...

37:34.824 --> 37:36.813
finally felt whole.

37:36.897 --> 37:38.510
And now...

37:40.715 --> 37:42.415
well, now I'm alone again.

37:44.437 --> 37:47.187
You were my protector, my rock.

37:49.408 --> 37:52.448
But I couldn't protect you.

37:52.499 --> 37:54.450
I failed you, and I'm...

37:54.561 --> 37:56.879
I will never forgive myself.

37:58.136 --> 37:59.996
You were a good soldier, you made mistakes,

38:00.066 --> 38:02.233
but you didn't deserve to die.

38:04.467 --> 38:06.148
Now that you're gone...

38:08.111 --> 38:13.131
it's up to us to make sure
that your death wasn't in vain.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.956
We owe that to you.

38:16.739 --> 38:18.205
To each other.

38:20.168 --> 38:22.201
And to our country.

38:26.284 --> 38:29.051
(silent chatter)

38:35.061 --> 38:36.256
Good, you're still here.

38:36.298 --> 38:38.206
Wow, what is that? Why
does it smell so good?

38:38.241 --> 38:40.231
I... our first dinner

38:40.302 --> 38:42.513
up at my cottage with Maya
was supposed to be Syrian,

38:42.548 --> 38:45.567
so... I found this place that makes

38:45.602 --> 38:47.150
the best makdous in the city.

38:47.185 --> 38:49.505
You liar, you do speak Arabic.

38:49.540 --> 38:50.750
(both chuckling)

38:50.796 --> 38:52.213
Since when do you speak Arabic?

38:52.261 --> 38:55.336
Well, people who aren't from
America speak other languages.

38:55.371 --> 38:57.688
Touché, touché.

38:57.738 --> 38:59.197
That's French, by the way.

38:59.232 --> 39:01.680
Yes, I know, I speak that too.

39:01.731 --> 39:06.089
Oh, that's just so wonderful
and sweet and thoughtful.

39:06.124 --> 39:07.715
Well, thank you, but it turns out they have

39:07.750 --> 39:09.965
a much stricter no cancellation pol...

39:14.614 --> 39:15.738
I...

39:16.761 --> 39:19.005
I must say, I'm getting some
very mixed signals from you.

39:19.075 --> 39:20.736
I... full disclosure, sorry.

39:20.738 --> 39:22.705
I'm... I'm so terrible at this stuff.

39:22.768 --> 39:24.608
A worthy adversary.

39:24.661 --> 39:26.053
- What?
- I... Well,

39:26.101 --> 39:29.443
sorry, I'm also terrible at this.

39:39.157 --> 39:40.689
Wait.

39:40.827 --> 39:42.058
What's up?

39:42.184 --> 39:43.650
What happened with Freddy last night?

39:43.685 --> 39:47.080
And don't tell me "nothing."
This is not nothing.

39:47.115 --> 39:49.307
We've spent so long keeping
secrets from each other,

39:49.349 --> 39:51.135
and look where that got us.

39:54.708 --> 39:58.301
Last night, Freddy told me some
things about when we were both kids.

39:59.621 --> 40:01.961
He said I should testify against Jones.

40:01.996 --> 40:03.345
So?

40:03.401 --> 40:04.834
As a victim.

40:08.358 --> 40:09.679
Is he right?

40:10.835 --> 40:12.334
I don't know.

40:16.039 --> 40:18.056
I lost time, Tasha.

40:19.555 --> 40:21.139
I just don't remember that part of my life

40:21.174 --> 40:23.595
the same way I remember the rest of it.

40:24.435 --> 40:25.845
You know, I...

40:27.871 --> 40:29.811
never really thought
much about it until now,

40:29.868 --> 40:31.220
and...

40:34.603 --> 40:37.125
but now it's starting to scare me.

40:38.919 --> 40:40.660
I don't know what to do.

41:00.123 --> 41:02.137
Thank you.

41:02.139 --> 41:04.019
For covering for me with Shepherd.

41:04.069 --> 41:05.379
Forget it.

41:06.367 --> 41:08.552
You've been through a lot.

41:08.587 --> 41:10.854
Now, it's gonna take some time.

41:12.236 --> 41:14.818
But I can't keep Shepherd at bay forever.

41:16.754 --> 41:18.793
You need to find your way back here.

41:20.258 --> 41:21.991
I'm working on it.

41:25.310 --> 41:28.197
Have I ever told you what
happened to my rabbit?

41:28.391 --> 41:30.499
When I couldn't kill him,

41:30.744 --> 41:33.385
the caretakers did it for me.

41:33.420 --> 41:34.766
They snapped its neck?

41:34.834 --> 41:36.048
No.

41:36.083 --> 41:37.846
They cut him in the belly.

41:38.643 --> 41:40.717
Left him to bleed out all night.

41:43.104 --> 41:45.173
I can still hear him screaming.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.853
Things around here are about to move quick.

41:50.945 --> 41:53.522
I can't save you a second time.

41:53.723 --> 41:56.626
So, if you can't wake up
the real Remy on your own,

41:56.773 --> 41:58.749
I'm gonna find your rabbit,

41:58.784 --> 42:00.195
and I'm gonna make him bleed.
