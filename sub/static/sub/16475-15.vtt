WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.170
- Attention, squad.

00:02.203 --> 00:04.138
Here's where we stand
vis-Ã -vis whether or not

00:04.172 --> 00:07.608
the precinct will be shut down.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.177
The precinct will be shut down.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.378
- What?
- No!

00:10.411 --> 00:12.122
- But I thought the official
hearing wasn't until tonight.

00:12.146 --> 00:13.490
Amy's friend at HQ
heard that maybe

00:13.514 --> 00:15.159
the Seven-Four was getting
shut down instead.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.427
- There's no way that's true.
- Amy doesn't have a friend.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.552
- I do so!

00:18.586 --> 00:20.354
Although, I only see her
at work events,

00:20.388 --> 00:22.256
and we only talk through email.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.533
Oh, God, she's just a colleague.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.127
- Santiago's work acquaintance
is correct.

00:26.160 --> 00:27.537
Tonight at 7:00
the committee is choosing

00:27.561 --> 00:29.230
between us and the Seven-Four,

00:29.263 --> 00:31.532
although the Seven-Four
has a significant advantage.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.268
They house
an elite gang task force.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.379
- Well, this is on you, sir.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.138
I begged you for a task force,

00:37.171 --> 00:39.107
but no, you wouldn't give me
funding for

00:39.140 --> 00:41.609
Strike-Team Thunder-Kill Alpha,
colon, Hard Target.

00:41.642 --> 00:43.111
- You never told me
what it was for.

00:43.144 --> 00:45.113
- It's a strike team that...

00:45.146 --> 00:48.349
kills thunder and puts its
colon on hard targets.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.217
- They're gonna split us up

00:49.250 --> 00:50.218
and send us all
to different precincts.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.453
This is the last time
I'm gonna stand up here

00:52.486 --> 00:53.654
and look at you guys.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.357
Hitchcock, close your damn legs!

00:56.390 --> 00:58.192
- No!
- This isn't over yet.

00:58.226 --> 00:59.293
Sure, maybe we don't have

00:59.327 --> 01:02.263
Strike-Team Thunder-Kill Alpha,
colon, Hard Target,

01:02.296 --> 01:03.364
but we're the Nine-Nine.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.399
We have Rosa and Charles,

01:05.433 --> 01:08.536
Gina, Amy and Terry, and Carl!

01:08.569 --> 01:09.337
- It's Mark.
- Sorry.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.547
I was just trying
to include someone

01:10.571 --> 01:11.539
from outside the inner circle.

01:11.572 --> 01:12.873
- There's an inner circle?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.875
- The point is
we're not rolling over.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.445
We're gonna solve a huge case
before the hearing tonight,

01:17.478 --> 01:19.847
and then the NYPD cannot
shut us down.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.683
So come on, Captain,
give me something big and juicy.

01:22.716 --> 01:23.517
What do you got?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.453
- A ten-year-old
had his bike stolen.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.188
- We are S'd in the B.

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.376 --> 01:50.344
- Hi-do-ho there,
Charlie old boy.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.612
Come have a seat.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.681
- Beanbags?
- But these are happy seats.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.483
Why are you happy?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.885
Oh, my God, you figured out
how to save the precinct.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.520
You got a juicy case.

01:59.553 --> 02:00.621
You juiced this mama.

02:00.654 --> 02:02.323
- Nope, same unjuicy case.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.192
New juicer attitude.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.360
The way I see it,
if this is to be our last ride

02:06.394 --> 02:08.496
then let us go out
in a blaze of glory.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.463
- Ooh.
- Charles, think about

02:09.497 --> 02:11.165
anything you ever
wanted to do on a case.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.166
We're doing it today.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.267
- Oh, hence the beanbags.

02:13.301 --> 02:14.902
- Hence is right, and also hence

02:14.935 --> 02:16.680
we're gonna drive around
in the coolest undercover car

02:16.704 --> 02:18.372
in the impound lot.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.940
- Herbie from
"Herbie Fully Loaded."

02:19.973 --> 02:21.242
- What? No.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.253
You really think "Herbie Fully
Loaded" was on the impound lot?

02:23.277 --> 02:24.921
- Without a doubt.
- Well, anyway, it's a Mustang.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.223
It's got a stripe
down the middle.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.315
- Like Herbie.
- Okay.

02:27.348 --> 02:30.218
- One question, can we wear
matching leather jackets?

02:30.251 --> 02:31.628
- Oh, man, I don't know
if we're gonna have time

02:31.652 --> 02:33.287
to pull something
like that together!

02:33.321 --> 02:34.355
What?

02:34.388 --> 02:35.489
- Blaze of glory!

02:35.523 --> 02:37.625
- Blaze of glory.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.660
- You're not giving us
any new cases?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.496
There's nothing to work on.

02:42.530 --> 02:44.665
Damn it!
So this is how it ends.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.768
- Well, every ending is
a new beginning.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.271
Another great
Gina Linetti entrance.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.640
You better savor these
while you still can, sarge.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.974
- Gina, I am not in the mood.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.743
How are you so unaffected
by all this?

02:55.776 --> 02:57.678
- Because I have
already moved on.

02:57.711 --> 03:00.581
I'm devoting my energy
to my new project, Ginazon.

03:00.614 --> 03:04.252
It's a one-stop online portal
for my legions of followers.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.421
Speaking of whom,
what's up G-Hive?

03:07.455 --> 03:08.722
It's Queen Gee.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.590
I'm bored at work,

03:09.623 --> 03:12.760
so I'm gonna prank
all my coworkers.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.796
- That sounds like a bad idea
for an already crappy day.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.665
- Fine, sarge.
- I won't do it.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.434
I will do it,
so you can count this

03:20.468 --> 03:22.736
as my first prank I guess,
unofficially.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.773
- Hey, Diaz, HQ isn't giving us
any new cases

03:25.806 --> 03:27.308
because we might shut down.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.442
You have anything?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.244
- No, sorry, I got nothing.
- Oh, man!

03:30.278 --> 03:33.514
I am one arrest away from
the all-time precinct record.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.349
Two more solves woulda
put me over the top.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.693
- So? Nothing wrong
with second place.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.352
- Name one silver medalist.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.354
- Michelle Kwan.
- She fell, Rosa.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.555
She fell so much!

03:41.589 --> 03:42.556
- Oh, yeah.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.492
- Besides, it's not about
me wanting the record.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.394
It's about who currently has it.

03:46.427 --> 03:47.395
Hitchcock.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.596
Hitchcock?

03:48.629 --> 03:49.497
- How is that possible?

03:49.530 --> 03:51.599
- He's been here 20 years
longer than me,

03:51.632 --> 03:54.468
and New York City in the '80s
was basically "The Purge."

03:54.502 --> 03:56.604
- I always knew I was
the best cop in the Nine-Nine,

03:56.637 --> 03:59.473
and now there's proof.

03:59.507 --> 04:02.410
Oh, man!
My pasghetti!

04:02.443 --> 04:04.445
- We're getting you that record.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.380
- Hey, can I talk
to the captain?

04:06.414 --> 04:07.448
- Ugh, he's on the phone.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.792
Do you want a coffee
while you wait?

04:08.816 --> 04:10.618
They made me an extra one
on accident.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.520
- Oh, sure.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.722
Thank you.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.524
Oh, my God!
What is that?

04:17.558 --> 04:20.361
- Cement!
- You just drank cement!

04:20.394 --> 04:22.496
Guys, check back in
to see if she dies.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.064
Ugh!

04:24.097 --> 04:26.500
You're not really gonna die
probably, okay?

04:26.534 --> 04:28.502
Just a little honey
for the G-Hive.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.339
Also you can talk to Holt.
He is not on the phone.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.606
- What is happening?

04:32.640 --> 04:36.276
- It's a little something I call
two pranks for the price of one!

04:38.479 --> 04:39.780
- Santiago, I'm on the phone.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.515
Triple prank!

04:41.549 --> 04:43.551
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- I can come back later.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.319
- No, it's too late.
- The call is ruined.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.521
Good-bye, dear.
What do you want?

04:47.555 --> 04:49.390
- Well, since there's
a good chance

04:49.423 --> 04:50.634
that things are coming
to an end,

04:50.658 --> 04:52.526
I just wanted to say thank you

04:52.560 --> 04:54.094
for everything
that you've taught me.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.730
I know you may not see yourself
as my mentor, but...

04:56.764 --> 04:58.842
- Of course I do. I've been
mentoring you all this time.

04:58.866 --> 05:01.502
- What?

05:01.535 --> 05:05.439
- This is day 1,282
of a nine-year mentorship

05:05.473 --> 05:06.640
I had mapped out for you.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.343
Under ordinary circumstances
I wouldn't reveal this to you

05:09.377 --> 05:10.678
until day 3,300.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.079
- It was real.

05:12.112 --> 05:13.681
There was a binder.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.349
- Not anymore.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.384
- No!

05:16.417 --> 05:17.661
You can still mentor me
if we don't work together.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.928
We could meet for breakfast
every day.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.388
You could teach me over eggs.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.522
- Eggs for breakfast?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.566
You're further behind
than I thought.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.358
- Ah!
- No, look, okay.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.560
There are ten hours left, sir.

05:26.594 --> 05:30.097
If you talk fast enough,
you can teach me everything.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.400
- Interesting.
- Okay.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.567
You'll have to take notes.

05:33.601 --> 05:34.744
Do you think you can keep up?

05:34.768 --> 05:37.104
- Let's just say I was president
of the Stenographer's Club

05:37.137 --> 05:38.772
in high school for a reason.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.809
- Was the reason because
you were the only member?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.411
- Yes.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.145
- This is so cool!

05:45.178 --> 05:46.580
I feel like we're
in a cologne ad.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.482
- Oh, yeah, check this out.

05:48.516 --> 05:49.717
- Whoop!
- Yeah!

05:49.750 --> 05:52.453
Cleaning your teeth in public
like you just don't give a what.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.698
- No, it's like a cool toothpick
like Stallone in "Cobra."

05:54.722 --> 05:55.623
- Eh, lateral move.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.725
Hey, I know this is just
a stolen bike case,

05:57.758 --> 05:58.868
but you know what we should do?

05:58.892 --> 06:01.161
Stand back-to-back
with our guns drawn

06:01.194 --> 06:02.796
while we're surrounded
by bad guys.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.940
- You know what I call that.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.499
- The man sprinkler.
- Bullet tornado.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.299
- Yep, bullet tornado.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.511
- What was yours?
- I didn't hear it.

06:07.535 --> 06:08.775
- Same as you.
- Bullet tornado.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.614
The important thing is we don't
have to talk about it anymore

06:10.638 --> 06:11.881
'cause we both said
the same excellent name.

06:11.905 --> 06:12.873
- Ah.
- Wait a minute, Boyle.

06:12.906 --> 06:13.874
Is this our bike?

06:13.907 --> 06:15.409
- Green grips, orange pegs.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.810
I think it is.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.749
NYPD!
Hands on your head!

06:21.782 --> 06:23.617
- Hood slide.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.619
Congratulations, punk.

06:25.653 --> 06:28.656
Charles, tell him what he won.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.500
You're supposed to tell him
he's won an all-expenses-paid,

06:30.524 --> 06:31.868
luxury trip to hell.
We rehearsed this.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.970
- I'm sorry, I know.
- It just hit me that it's over.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.629
I wanted the case
to last longer.

06:35.663 --> 06:37.631
- Come on,
it's not necessarily over.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.667
I mean, this guy could still
make a break for it

06:39.700 --> 06:41.835
or take me hostage or...

06:41.869 --> 06:43.771
have a huge bag of heroin.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.439
- Oh, my God, it's not over yet.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.874
This just became
a giant drug case.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.785
- We can save the Nine-Nine.
- We can save the Nine-Nine!

06:48.809 --> 06:50.754
- This man is our savior.
- And he looks like Jesus.

06:50.778 --> 06:52.021
- Yeah, he looks like
a hunky Jesus.

06:52.045 --> 06:52.846
- Yeah!

06:52.880 --> 06:54.715
- Thanks for the heroin,
Hunky Jesus.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.162
- How'd the interrogation go?
- Awesome.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.188
I got to do something
that I always wanted to do.

07:01.221 --> 07:03.090
You make me sick.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.159
Hee-ya!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.128
He was actually really helpful.
I feel bad.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.230
Anyways, turns out he works
for a dealer named Dom,

07:10.263 --> 07:12.199
who supplies half
the heroin in the city.

07:12.232 --> 07:13.567
If we take him down,

07:13.601 --> 07:15.044
there's no way they close
the Nine-Nine.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.504
- But the hearing's
in six hours.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.971
How do we get the Dom?

07:18.005 --> 07:20.073
- Apparently he uses
BMX riders to move his product,

07:20.107 --> 07:21.909
and as it turns out
when I was a kid

07:21.942 --> 07:23.811
I was a vert fiend.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.221
- That's great news.
- Please explain that.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.113
- That means I rode BMX.
- Ah.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.181
- So we get our perp
to text this Dom guy,

07:28.215 --> 07:29.950
tell him to hire me
to move his product.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.919
Then I show up,
grind a bunch of gnarly rails.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.554
I'm talking real fluffy ones.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.064
- Radical. I bet you're
an awesome fluffer.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.123
- No.
- I bet you fluffed

07:36.156 --> 07:37.867
those other riders right out
of their biker shorts.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.859
- Charles...
- I can picture you

07:38.892 --> 07:40.928
as a teenager fluffing
all of New York City.

07:40.961 --> 07:41.929
- Charles, stop talking.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.239
Fluffing has
a different meaning.

07:43.263 --> 07:45.032
So I get the job,
we take down Dom,

07:45.065 --> 07:47.234
precinct's saved,
then I do an ice pick 360

07:47.267 --> 07:49.202
on the podium
at the press conference.

07:49.236 --> 07:51.204
- Awesome.
- One question.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.506
Do you still know how to ride?

07:52.540 --> 07:53.974
- Come on, riding a bike,

07:54.007 --> 07:55.543
it's like riding a bike.

07:55.576 --> 07:56.577
Wheelie.
No.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.911
Wheelie.
No.

07:57.945 --> 07:58.955
Boyle, it's 'cause
you're watching.

07:58.979 --> 07:59.947
- Okay.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.948
One more try.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.949
One more try.

08:01.982 --> 08:02.950
One more try.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.951
One more try.

08:03.984 --> 08:04.952
One more try.

08:04.985 --> 08:05.953
- Did you do it?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.254
- Hey, sarge, check it out.

08:07.287 --> 08:08.556
Hitchcock got a tattoo.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.558
- Mr. Nine-Nine.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.226
- Why are you putting
a gun in your mouth?

08:13.260 --> 08:14.962
- I'm blowing smoke
off the barrel.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.896
It's cool.

08:15.929 --> 08:18.098
- The barrel is fully
inside your mouth.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.933
You're clearly about
to kill yourself.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.878
- You're just jealous 'cause
he's got the arrest record

08:21.902 --> 08:22.970
and you don't.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.838
- Yeah, suck on this.
- Click, pow!

08:25.973 --> 08:28.275
- You pulled the trigger, man!
- That was a suicide!

08:28.308 --> 08:30.210
- Sarge, I got a case for you.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.212
Guy had his phone stolen
at a bar last night.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.246
- All right!

08:33.280 --> 08:34.323
- It's not that big a deal.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.659
I just need to file
a police report

08:35.683 --> 08:36.917
for my insurance company.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.986
- No, it is a major injustice,
and we're gonna set it right.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.198
- It was a crappy old phone.
- I'd rather just get a new one.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.256
- We're the police
and we're here to help you.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.859
So shut your damn mouth.

08:45.893 --> 08:46.970
Now tell us what he looked like.

08:46.994 --> 08:47.961
- I only saw his back.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.105
Uh, he had a blue hoodie on.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.131
- Whoo!
- We got a lead!

08:54.001 --> 08:56.870
- * Ah, you just drank cement

08:56.904 --> 08:58.606
* You just drank cement

08:58.639 --> 09:00.207
- Dom just texted.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.042
The meet-up spot
is ten minutes away.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.176
- This is so awesome.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.154
When I was a kid, I said I
wanted to be a BMX detective,

09:05.178 --> 09:06.079
and they laughed at me.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.181
Well, who's laughing now,
Kenny Yarborough?

09:08.215 --> 09:09.959
Kenny actually opened up
a chain of salad places.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.994
He's doing quite well
for himself.

09:11.018 --> 09:11.919
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:11.952 --> 09:15.255
- Hey, what if they can tell
you're amazing

09:15.288 --> 09:17.324
but a little rusty
and therefore kinda bad?

09:17.357 --> 09:20.027
- Not to worry,
BMX is 99% attitude.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.129
So here's the plan,
my name is Tyler Omaha,

09:22.162 --> 09:23.731
born and raised in So-Cal.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.564
Point me to a quarter pipe

09:24.598 --> 09:26.967
and I'm gonna tail-whip
for days, bro.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.236
- And I'm your roller-skating
sidekick, Chip Rockets.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.304
- Welcome aboard, Chip Rockets.
- Thank you.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.272
- And you're married
to the roller skates?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.141
- A hundred percent.
- Roller skates it is.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.043
- Right.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.286
- Just 'cause you're only
gonna be in the car.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.688
- A hundred percent, Jake.
- Chip Rockets!

09:38.712 --> 09:40.380
- Chip Rockets.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.750
- Sorry, dude, we don't need
any new riders.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.351
- You know, I used to be pro,

09:44.384 --> 09:46.153
but they said my antics
were too gnar.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.755
- Kicked me off the circuit.
- For what?

09:47.788 --> 09:48.656
- You know, peeing on the track,

09:48.689 --> 09:50.658
having sex during races,
being hella gnar.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.235
You get it, we all have
gyros on our bikes.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.062
The point is I can cut
your delivery times in half.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.006
- Seriously, in half?
- I think you're full of it.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.207
I don't think
you could even beat Bodie,

09:58.231 --> 09:59.199
and he's my worst guy.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.100
- Your worst guy?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.069
Come on, I could take
any of these posers.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.972
- Fine, then race Derek.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.149
- Nah, I don't wanna
trouble Derek.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.140
Let's just stick with Bodie.

10:07.174 --> 10:08.141
First thought, best thought,
right?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.276
Let's do this.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.778
- It should take 70 seconds

10:10.811 --> 10:12.388
for you to fully gauge
someone's character.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.714
Here's what to look for.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.783
Grammar, posture, scent, attire,

10:15.816 --> 10:18.085
level of perspiration,
type of shirt collar.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.086
- What's the best type
of shirt collar?

10:19.119 --> 10:19.987
- English Spread, obviously,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.989
but let's hold the questions
until the end.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.700
When people say, "Good morning,"
they mean, "Hello."

10:23.724 --> 10:26.193
When people say, "How are you?"
they mean, "Hello."

10:26.226 --> 10:27.695
When people say, "What's up?"

10:27.728 --> 10:30.197
they mean, "I am a person
not worth talking to."

10:30.230 --> 10:32.332
There are two acceptable
sleep positions.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.201
On back, toes up, arms crossed,

10:34.234 --> 10:36.704
or on back, toes up,
arms at the side.

10:36.737 --> 10:38.171
Do not trust
any child that chews

10:38.205 --> 10:39.807
bubble gum-flavored
bubble gum.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.409
Do not trust any adult
that chews gum at all.

10:42.442 --> 10:45.345
Never vacation in Banff.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.047
- Okay, you guys
know the course.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.049
First one to get to Creston
and 10th rides for me.

10:49.082 --> 10:50.217
Loser is out.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.087
- Hey, Bodie, you seem
like a reasonable dude.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.364
Just let me win
and I'll owe you big time.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.266
- I really need this.
- I really need this, too.

10:57.290 --> 10:58.759
I haven't eaten in three days,

10:58.792 --> 11:00.403
and my bookie says
if I don't pay him back

11:00.427 --> 11:01.695
he's gonna kill my dog.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.096
- Mm-kay that's very intense.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.131
- Please let me win.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.166
Since my mom died,
that dog is my only family.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.711
- I am so sorry.
- I shouldn't have engaged.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.713
- It got way too real.
- I'm gonna lose everything!

11:09.737 --> 11:11.271
- Yep, putting on my helmet now.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.340
- Ready, go!
- Whoa!

11:16.209 --> 11:19.012
He's so fast.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.247
Too fast.

11:23.817 --> 11:27.020
I'm losing.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.222
Whoa!

11:29.256 --> 11:31.158
- Chip Rockets!

11:31.191 --> 11:32.760
Sorry about your dog, Bodie.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.437
Oh, man, why'd I say that?
Now I feel terrible.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.463
I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win.

11:36.496 --> 11:37.731
Wait, ramp, ramp, ramp, ramp!

11:37.765 --> 11:39.266
Ahhh!

11:41.268 --> 11:43.370
No!

11:43.403 --> 11:45.272
Oh, I see what I did wrong.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.807
I did the jump bad.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.577
- You okay, Jake?

11:50.610 --> 11:51.788
- Well, aside from the fact
that the Nine-Nine's hearing

11:51.812 --> 11:54.447
is in four hours and we're
definitely getting shut down,

11:54.481 --> 11:56.483
no, I bruised my thigh.

11:56.516 --> 11:57.885
- It's gonna be just fine, Jake.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.787
- No, it isn't, Charles.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.755
It's on my right hip.
I sleep on that side.

12:01.789 --> 12:02.655
It was stupid of me to think

12:02.689 --> 12:04.491
I could make this
the best case ever.

12:04.524 --> 12:05.859
Let's just go back
to the precinct

12:05.893 --> 12:06.970
so you can make me hot cocoa.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.171
- I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

12:08.195 --> 12:10.497
but no, I will not
make you hot cocoa.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.432
- Charles!
- I have a bruise!

12:12.465 --> 12:14.210
- I won't do it,
not when there's still a chance

12:14.234 --> 12:16.445
- we can save the Nine-Nine.
- What are you talking about?

12:16.469 --> 12:18.038
When I took down
that guy Bodie...

12:18.071 --> 12:19.306
- Chip Rockets!

12:19.339 --> 12:21.909
I planted a bug
with a GPS tracker on it.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.177
- Chip Rockets,
you beautiful bastard.

12:24.211 --> 12:25.545
- Chip actually is a bastard.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.880
Never knew either
of his parents.

12:26.914 --> 12:27.915
Raised by the rink.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.449
- Ooh, badass backstory.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.450
- Stole it from a TV movie.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.451
It was about ice dancing,

12:31.484 --> 12:32.628
but I adapted it
for the hardwood.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.955
- That makes it way worse,
but I'm gonna move past it.

12:34.988 --> 12:37.024
Let's track down Bodie
and save the precinct.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.259
- Okay, we're making progress
on your phone.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.837
We went to the bar
where it was taken...

12:40.861 --> 12:42.462
Wait, why are you in handcuffs?

12:42.495 --> 12:43.931
- Because I've been arrested.

12:43.964 --> 12:44.932
- What?
- By who?

12:44.965 --> 12:46.466
- Hitchcock, baby.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.311
I busted his butt for filing
a false police report.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.904
- He broke his phone, but
insurance wouldn't reimburse him

12:50.938 --> 12:52.305
unless he reported it as stolen.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.240
- Are you serious?

12:53.273 --> 12:55.075
How the hell did you
solve this, Hitchcock?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.543
- Good old-fashioned
detective work.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.477
- Yeah, they have no idea.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.980
They think the phone
was actually stolen.

13:00.013 --> 13:01.915
- You're under arrest, jerk-o.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.217
- Don't even think about it.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.162
- He thought the bathroom was
empty because we use the toilet

13:06.186 --> 13:07.955
with our feet up
on the stall door.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.833
- Explain any further
and I will kneecap you both.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.258
- You can't boss me around.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.961
I'm the greatest detective
in the history of here.

13:13.994 --> 13:17.097
Mr. Nine-Nine, out.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.565
- Okay,
according to the tracker,

13:18.598 --> 13:20.233
Bodie's at a warehouse
on 11th Street.

13:20.267 --> 13:22.235
ESU is on site
and waiting for our go.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.904
- Great, time to gear up.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.873
It's not the best case ever
without some toys.

13:25.906 --> 13:29.076
- Oh, yeah.
- Toys for boys.

13:29.109 --> 13:29.943
- I don't know if I like that.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.220
- Adult toys.
- Still sounds wrong.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.913
- Male toys.
- You know what?

13:32.946 --> 13:34.190
Let's just not call them toys.
That's my fault, I started it.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.591
- You got it, we'll just
call them playthings.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.017
- We will not.
- Let's do this.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.219
Sniper binoculars.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.288
Here, Charles, tell me
how far away I am.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.856
- Too close to measure.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.057
- They really work.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.194
That's everything.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.262
Let's do this.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.536
- This is way too much stuff.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.570
- Yeah.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.873
And it's too heavy to carry
all the way back.

14:03.911 --> 14:06.179
Terry.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.015
- Five minutes left.
- What have I missed?

14:08.048 --> 14:09.192
- Professional handshake.
- We did that.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.084
Fingers with
a half-centimeter spread,

14:11.118 --> 14:12.986
up, down, then separate.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.154
- Good.
- Acceptable fabrics?

14:14.187 --> 14:15.155
- Cotton or cotton blend.

14:15.188 --> 14:16.289
Wool is for outerwear only,

14:16.323 --> 14:18.191
and silk is for sex workers
or musicians.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.359
- Right.
- Good desserts?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.393
- There are none.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.138
If you are hungry,
you should have had more dinner.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.330
- That's it!
- We're done.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.998
You've been mentored.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.967
- Oh, my God!
- We did it!

14:27.000 --> 14:28.301
I can't believe we did it!

14:28.335 --> 14:31.271
Oh, no, we did it.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.006
It's over.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.574
- Yes, I agree.

14:34.607 --> 14:37.077
Up, down, separation.

14:39.079 --> 14:42.049
- Separation.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.952
- Oh, girl, you look so sad.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.229
You know what would
cheer you up?

14:46.253 --> 14:48.255
A nice bowl of miso soup.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.690
- No thanks, Gina.
- I'm not in the mood.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.325
- So, Gina, is that soup
up for grabs?

14:52.359 --> 14:53.426
- Scully, no.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.663
My followers are sick
of watching you eat cement.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.067
- There they are.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.069
We are .1524 kilometers away.

15:02.102 --> 15:04.347
I have no idea what that means,
but it's still pretty cool.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.039
Charles, can you hear
what they're saying?

15:06.073 --> 15:07.107
- Uh, no.
- Really?

15:07.140 --> 15:08.075
It looks like they're talking.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.618
- They're not.
- They're definitely not talking.

15:09.642 --> 15:10.753
- I can see their lips moving.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.213
Wait a minute, why won't
you tell me what they're saying?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.115
- They're making fun
of Tyler Omaha.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.084
- Oh, what?
- I thought I was pretty good.

15:17.117 --> 15:18.251
- Me too!

15:18.285 --> 15:20.196
And you definitely don't look
anything like Rachel Maddow.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.721
- Oh, come on!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.656
- Hold on.
- Something's happening.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.891
That's a huge bag.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.170
If that's full of heroin, we
could really save the precinct.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.962
- Oh, I can just hear Holt now.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.231
"I'm proud of you, Peralta.
You are my hero."

15:31.264 --> 15:32.375
The guy is obsessed with me.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.101
- All right, we gotta
make the bust now.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.278
We only have 30 minutes left
till the hearing.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.645
- No, no, no, no,
wait, stand down.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.438
It's not heroin in the bags.
It's money.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.107
- Yeah, that's millions
in drug money.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.350
We can still arrest them
for that.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.709
- Let's do it.
- No.

15:42.742 --> 15:43.953
If they have
that much money on them,

15:43.977 --> 15:46.222
it means they're probably gonna
meet up with their supplier.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.647
Can you hear
what they're saying?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.382
- Yeah, I'm trying
to make it out.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.051
Sounds like...
Oh, you're right.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.752
They're getting a shipment
at 8:30.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.397
- Whoa, Dom's one of the biggest
dealers in New York.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.389
Whoever their supplier is
is gonna be huge.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.425
- We gotta wait.
- But that's two hours from now.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.294
We'll miss the hearing.
Let's just arrest Dom.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.206
- We'd be getting
a major player off the streets.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.198
I mean, isn't that the job?

16:05.232 --> 16:07.334
- So what are you saying?

16:07.367 --> 16:11.171
- I'm saying the Nine-Nine's
gonna get shut down.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.305
- Damn it!

16:12.339 --> 16:14.317
- I know, it sucks,
but it's the right thing to do.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.285
- No, not that, they're making
fun of Chip Rockets now.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.320
- These drug dealers
are so mean.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.378
- Right!

16:22.515 --> 16:24.317
But it's a big bust,

16:24.351 --> 16:26.686
and at least we're going out
in a blaze of glory.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.489
- Yeah. It feels more like
a blaze of crap.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.659
- Ah, you're gonna be fine.
- You're gonna get a new partner.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.494
His name's gonna be
Heath or Ryan.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.596
He's gonna know everything
about "Die Hard,"

16:36.629 --> 16:38.231
and he's gonna be super cool.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.499
Jean jacket cool.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.768
- Yeah, yeah,
you could be right.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.679
And hey, you'll get
a cool, new partner too, right?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.505
- Eh.
- He'll love fine dining

16:45.538 --> 16:46.673
and musical theater

16:46.706 --> 16:49.576
and hearing about every
explicit detail of your sex life

16:49.609 --> 16:51.378
over and over and over.

16:51.411 --> 16:52.379
- Just like you.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.680
- Yeah, yeah, just like me.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.415
- Yes, you're right.
- It's gonna be fine.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.684
I'm gonna be totally fine
without you.

16:57.717 --> 17:00.553
I'm gonna check the distance
on the warehouse there.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.554
- Copy.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.723
- Yep, the building
hasn't moved.

17:03.756 --> 17:08.761
It's still .1524 kilometers...
away.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.539
- Wait, are you just
holding up the binoculars

17:10.563 --> 17:11.531
so I can't see you cry?

17:11.564 --> 17:12.799
- No!

17:12.832 --> 17:14.767
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

17:14.800 --> 17:15.902
Come to think of it,

17:15.935 --> 17:19.806
I'm gonna double-check
our building distance as well.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.574
Mm-hmm.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.614
- I see you filming, Linetti.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.316
- What's in the yogurt?
- Normal stuff.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.284
Nothing you'd use
to make a sidewalk with.

17:31.318 --> 17:34.321
- Attention squad, I just got
word from Peralta and Boyle.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.099
- Did they make their bust?
- They save the precinct?

17:36.123 --> 17:38.391
- No, they decided to try
to bring in a bigger fish.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.785
They're not gonna
make the hearing.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.570
- So Jake's doing
the right thing

17:41.594 --> 17:43.630
instead of the selfish thing?

17:43.663 --> 17:44.764
You did this to him.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.609
- Look, I know we all want
this precinct to survive,

17:46.633 --> 17:47.834
but I'm proud of them.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.703
Loyalty to your friends and
fellow officers is important,

17:50.737 --> 17:54.507
but more important is our
loyalty to this city

17:54.541 --> 17:55.675
and its citizens.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.844
So I guess what
I'm trying to say is

17:57.877 --> 18:00.713
let's go get drunk.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.449
See anything?

18:02.482 --> 18:05.118
Nope. You?

18:05.152 --> 18:07.654
- No, I just love these
binoculars so much.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.356
I don't wanna put them down,
you know?

18:09.389 --> 18:10.857
- Oh, man,
when this case is over,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.592
I'm gonna miss these binoculars.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.327
- Me too.

18:16.163 --> 18:17.330
- It's almost 8;30.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.441
We're gonna get into position.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.532
- Okay, thanks, Marv.

18:19.566 --> 18:20.500
- Are you guys crying?

18:20.533 --> 18:23.770
- I said thanks, Marv!
- That means move on.

18:30.477 --> 18:33.580
- I'm sorry that our last case
wasn't our best case ever.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.149
- No, don't say that.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.884
Every case with you
is the best case ever.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.587
- Oh.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.490
- Now come on, we still have
a drug dealer to bust, right?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.591
You know what that means.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.634
- Bullet tornado!
- Man sprinkler!

18:45.658 --> 18:47.927
Bullet tornado,
that's what I said both times.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.829
Okay, Marv, go, go, go, go, go!

18:49.862 --> 18:53.600
- NYPD! Down!
- Everybody, down!

18:53.633 --> 18:55.668
- Hey.

18:55.702 --> 18:57.504
Congratulations
on getting the record.

18:57.537 --> 18:58.805
- What are you talking about?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.573
I came up short.

19:00.607 --> 19:02.709
Hitchcock beat me.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.910
What are all these?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.412
- B&E I worked last year.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.380
You noticed a clue I missed.

19:07.414 --> 19:08.615
Arson I solved last summer.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.718
You gave me advice on how to
break the guy in interrogation.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.620
Blackmail from '09.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.821
You said the nanny did it,

19:14.854 --> 19:17.390
and guess what,
the nanny did it.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.525
- I don't understand.

19:18.558 --> 19:19.768
- You didn't just work
your own cases.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.894
You helped me and Jake

19:21.928 --> 19:23.129
and Charles and Amy.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.499
There are hundreds of cases
that wouldn't have been solved

19:26.533 --> 19:27.500
without you.

19:27.534 --> 19:28.668
You add all that up,

19:28.701 --> 19:29.945
that's a record nobody's
ever gonna touch.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.938
Congratulations,
Mr. Nine-Nine.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.706
- Thanks, Diaz.

19:33.740 --> 19:37.877
- Hey, guys, sorry we couldn't,
you know, save the precinct.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.912
- Nothing to be sorry about.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.249
Your moral compass
is on fire right now.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.859
- Okay, forget I said anything.
- This is better.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.685
- At least we had
an awesome bust.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.254
- Yeah, we went back-to-back.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.956
Oh, man, we must look so cool.

19:49.989 --> 19:51.491
- You finally did
the man sprinkler.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.959
- What?
- I never called it that.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.661
- Attention, squad.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.563
I just got off the phone
with One Police Plaza.

19:56.596 --> 19:57.873
The hearing is over,
and here's where we stand

19:57.897 --> 20:00.433
vis-Ã -vis the precinct
being shut down.

20:00.467 --> 20:02.802
The precinct
will not be shut down.

20:02.835 --> 20:03.870
- Oh!
- Yeah!

20:03.903 --> 20:05.848
- They decided to shut down
the Seven-Four instead.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.540
- Wait, I don't understand.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.576
- Apparently the community
came to our aid.

20:09.609 --> 20:10.977
There was a swell
of online support

20:11.010 --> 20:13.980
orchestrated by an organization
called "Gina-zone."

20:14.013 --> 20:16.783
- I think you mean Ginazon.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.552
I was behind the bar
the whole time.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.521
Another great
Gina Linetti entrance.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.590
- I told you,
you can't be back here.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.458
- And I told you, I already am.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.526
- What did you do?

20:26.559 --> 20:27.670
- I was live-streaming a prank

20:27.694 --> 20:28.971
when Captain Holt
made his big speech

20:28.995 --> 20:30.806
about how you did
the right thing for the city.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.764
I guess people were moved.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.666
They were like,
"What can we do to help?"

20:33.700 --> 20:35.311
And I said, "Call
the commissioner's office."

20:35.335 --> 20:36.903
- The G-Hive is real.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.606
I can't believe you did it.
Gina, you're a legend.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.308
To the Nine-Nine!

20:41.341 --> 20:43.510
Nine-Nine!

20:45.077 --> 20:49.682
Y'all just drank cement!

20:51.684 --> 20:53.753
- Santiago,
the precinct's been saved.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.754
Why are you so glum?

20:54.787 --> 20:56.589
- Because our mentorship
is over.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.325
I blew it all in one day.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.892
- Yes, volume one
of our mentorship.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.828
- There's more volumes?
- Of course.

21:01.861 --> 21:04.864
You think I could fit it all
in one binder?

21:04.897 --> 21:07.066
- Okay, good.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.176
- You don't seem very excited.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.638
- Oh, I was just adhering
to section 7, page 145.

21:11.671 --> 21:13.640
"No emotional displays
in the workplace."

21:13.673 --> 21:15.908
- Excellent.
- I taught you well.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.910
- Now if you'll excuse me,

21:17.944 --> 21:19.646
I have some work to do

21:19.679 --> 21:21.714
on the roof.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.658
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
