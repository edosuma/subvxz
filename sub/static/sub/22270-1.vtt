- Ready?
- Yup.

01:07.707 --> 01:09.943
- Good night.
- Good night.

02:10.870 --> 02:12.303
I appreciate it
very much.

02:12.305 --> 02:14.108
Oh, you're very,
very welcome.

04:06.085 --> 04:09.121
Blackie.
Want some food? Come on.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.925
Good boy.

04:12.091 --> 04:14.694
Sit. Sit.

04:16.096 --> 04:20.668
God bless this little guy,
amen. Okay.

04:28.108 --> 04:29.673
Hello?

04:29.675 --> 04:32.144
<i>Yeah, next Friday,</i>

04:32.146 --> 04:34.880
- <i>I gotta go in towards town.</i>
- Yeah.

04:34.882 --> 04:38.784
<i>I'm having a hard
time rounding up a ride</i>

04:38.786 --> 04:41.652
<i>with somebody that
has a clean vehicle.</i>

04:41.654 --> 04:45.589
<i>I was wondering if you wasn't
doin' anything next Friday,</i>

04:45.591 --> 04:47.459
<i>if you had time,
if you'd be able</i>

04:47.461 --> 04:49.760
- to give me a ride in there.
- Okay.

04:49.762 --> 04:52.029
And have you already sort
of cased the parking lot

04:52.031 --> 04:53.597
and things like that?

04:53.599 --> 04:56.101
Do you know that you can
get in the building?

04:56.103 --> 04:58.469
<i>No, I don't know.</i>

05:03.676 --> 05:06.977
Hi, my name's Susan Malloy,
and I'm taking a friend

05:06.979 --> 05:12.116
to the doctor's to see
Dr. Peterson on Friday the 12th.

05:12.118 --> 05:13.851
<i>For what?
Peterson?</i>

05:13.853 --> 05:16.488
Yes,
do you remember off-hand

05:16.490 --> 05:18.759
when your pest-control
company comes?

05:20.159 --> 05:23.027
<i>Uh, our pest control?
No, I have no idea.</i>

05:23.029 --> 05:24.830
How can I find out?

05:24.832 --> 05:28.133
About the maintenance schedule
and pest control schedule?

05:28.135 --> 05:29.900
<i>Uh, hold on.</i>

05:40.747 --> 05:43.080
<i>He comes the first
of every month.</i>

05:43.082 --> 05:45.950
Okay, that's good
for our purposes.

05:45.952 --> 05:47.519
<i>Yup.</i>

05:47.521 --> 05:49.120
Okay, and that's
the pest-control guy?

05:49.122 --> 05:52.823
- <i>Yes.</i>
- All right.

05:52.825 --> 05:54.659
Do you know if he's treating
for ants

05:54.661 --> 05:56.695
or anything in particular?

05:56.697 --> 05:58.195
<i>He's just treating
for everything.</i>

05:58.197 --> 05:59.830
Like some kind
of broad spectrum?

05:59.832 --> 06:02.736
Okay.
How about carpet shampoo?

06:05.204 --> 06:07.238
<i>I'm not sure, hold on.</i>

06:13.212 --> 06:15.080
<i>I don't know how
long it normally takes</i>

06:15.082 --> 06:18.215
<i>for people to get
significantly better.</i>

06:18.217 --> 06:20.217
<i>You know, what do
people normally do?</i>

06:20.219 --> 06:21.952
Get out of the line of fire.

06:21.954 --> 06:24.121
Figure out what is
triggering her symptoms

06:24.123 --> 06:26.291
and get it out of the house.

06:26.293 --> 06:28.527
There are a surprising
number of people here

06:28.529 --> 06:30.227
who found out once
they get rid of some

06:30.229 --> 06:31.863
of the chemical exposures.

06:31.865 --> 06:35.967
What seems to really hurt
is electronic equipment.

06:35.969 --> 06:38.236
You know, computers
and routers and cellphones

06:38.238 --> 06:40.005
and things like that.

06:40.007 --> 06:42.039
<i>Okay, I'll tell her that.</i>

06:42.041 --> 06:44.310
<i>We're trying
as much as we can.</i>

06:52.252 --> 06:53.954
Out of where?

07:17.911 --> 07:19.277
I know, sweetie.

07:19.279 --> 07:21.779
I don't, um...

07:21.781 --> 07:26.219
I don't have any miracles.
I wish I did.

07:42.836 --> 07:46.705
<i>First saved voice message.</i>

07:46.707 --> 07:51.275
<i>Hi, Susan,
this is Jamal from the STC.</i>

07:51.277 --> 07:56.313
<i>You can do a Google search
on STC radio frequency safety</i>

07:56.315 --> 07:59.250
<i>and from reading that,
there does seem to be</i>

07:59.252 --> 08:03.020
<i>a rule making that might
be currently underway</i>

08:03.022 --> 08:05.323
<i>so there might be
an opportunity to submit</i>

08:05.325 --> 08:08.194
<i>feedback in that rule making.</i>

08:36.222 --> 08:40.957
Their dad's a musician,
and they grew up...

08:40.960 --> 08:43.061
like, he wasn't around
after the first few years

08:43.063 --> 08:45.029
but they grew up
around music with me

08:45.031 --> 08:47.533
and him and just sort of...

08:50.936 --> 08:54.105
uh, it's just kind of
part of us.

08:54.107 --> 08:57.909
I really just usually
am feeling melancholy,

08:57.911 --> 09:00.377
and I pick up the guitar,
and I'm usually...

09:00.379 --> 09:03.349
I'm mining that vein,
you know?

09:14.728 --> 09:17.932
That's Nathan
playing his guitar.

09:20.032 --> 09:22.669
They were more functional,
you know, a while back.

09:28.374 --> 09:32.143
Ah, let's see, these were
made when we were living

09:32.145 --> 09:34.379
in San Mateo
and probably about the time

09:34.381 --> 09:36.450
they moved over, maybe.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.417
Well, that was Karen.

09:39.419 --> 09:41.052
Must've been
something funny going on.

09:41.054 --> 09:43.388
I don't know what.

09:43.390 --> 09:46.725
This is when they were leaving,
how optimistic they were.

10:04.377 --> 10:06.944
So are we forgetting anything?

10:06.946 --> 10:11.249
It's a short one today
so, uh... there's water,

10:11.251 --> 10:14.251
and then there's
lettuce, banana.

10:14.253 --> 10:16.322
12 quarts of juice.

10:22.796 --> 10:27.500
You hang on to the fact that God
has promised to take care of us.

10:30.302 --> 10:32.303
You know, I've talked
to the pastors

10:32.305 --> 10:34.938
at different times about this,
you know, and one'll say,

10:34.940 --> 10:38.409
"Well, some things you
can't fix," you know.

10:38.411 --> 10:43.313
He said, "Well, you just
gotta draw a line in the sand

10:43.315 --> 10:45.817
and do nothing."

10:45.819 --> 10:49.590
And I said,
"That's not an option."

11:04.503 --> 11:06.971
I think it's a birthday
greetings of some sort.

11:06.973 --> 11:11.543
Uh-huh.
39, getting up there.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.345
Did she do
a drawing?

11:14.347 --> 11:16.316
Uh, somebody did.

11:22.855 --> 11:24.424
Thank you.

11:45.177 --> 11:48.714
Karen was only 17
when she really became ill.

12:00.526 --> 12:04.028
She would react rather
severely to certain things,

12:04.030 --> 12:08.335
but she couldn't really pinpoint
it, what it was, you know.

12:16.910 --> 12:21.148
She was ill when she was
carrying Sam and Nathan.

12:24.884 --> 12:29.122
I guess they just absorbed
the problem from her.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.924
The doctors said they
should get someplace

12:33.926 --> 12:37.662
where it would be
healthier to be.

12:37.664 --> 12:40.664
She should go where it's
cleaner and drier air,

12:40.666 --> 12:45.172
and they knew about Arizona,
so that's why they came over.

12:46.506 --> 12:49.941
I sold my place
over in California, you know.

12:49.943 --> 12:54.181
When I did that, we had
the resource to do the house.

12:57.150 --> 12:59.951
And now they've had
trouble with neighbors

12:59.953 --> 13:02.256
and spraying
and stuff like that.

13:05.658 --> 13:10.561
I guess
it's been 20 years ago

13:10.563 --> 13:13.197
that they actually got really...

13:13.199 --> 13:16.202
had to be in bed a lot,
you know.

13:17.336 --> 13:19.703
And that's
half their life, you know?

13:23.008 --> 13:25.945
She hasn't allowed
people to go in.

13:45.364 --> 13:47.365
You wonder
when it's gonna turn around

13:47.367 --> 13:50.237
and do a little better,
you know?

13:57.377 --> 14:00.614
Yes, I need to
refill prescriptions.

14:02.581 --> 14:03.916
I do.

14:06.585 --> 14:09.187
Okay,
there are three of them,

14:09.189 --> 14:11.521
and they're all
for Joe Fasciulo.

14:11.523 --> 14:12.756
F as in Frank,

14:12.758 --> 14:15.394
A, S as in Sam.

15:16.522 --> 15:18.088
I don't know
how to tell you to prepare

15:18.090 --> 15:20.693
for this show
you're gonna see.

15:25.364 --> 15:28.399
I am so
entertainment deprived.

15:30.203 --> 15:32.873
It'll be like "The Ed Sullivan
show" right there.

15:34.474 --> 15:36.808
I don't get to see
my granddaughters very often

15:36.810 --> 15:39.712
so just to get
to see them is...

15:43.550 --> 15:46.650
I'm gonna go down
there without my mask

15:46.652 --> 15:51.489
I just want them
to remember me...

15:51.491 --> 15:52.892
without the mask.

15:56.463 --> 15:57.730
Yup.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.839
They're not
bothered by the mask.

16:07.507 --> 16:10.241
I'm bothered
that they'd point at me.

16:10.243 --> 16:11.641
They don't point at you.

16:11.643 --> 16:13.644
You know they do.

16:13.646 --> 16:14.846
They point at you?

16:14.848 --> 16:16.447
They point at the mask.

16:16.449 --> 16:18.485
Well, okay, they do.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.419
If something's gonna
hurt me a little bit

16:22.421 --> 16:24.422
I'm gonna have to
make a sacrifice.

16:24.424 --> 16:27.828
I'm gonna choose to do
it when they're here.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.467
You get pretty good when
you're around them.

16:37.469 --> 16:39.740
I know, 'cause I don't
want them to see this.

16:54.554 --> 16:56.520
Jojo!

16:56.522 --> 16:57.822
Hi, Mimi Rue.

16:57.824 --> 16:59.323
How are you?

16:59.325 --> 17:02.796
I bet you like my
sister's piggy tails?

17:05.265 --> 17:07.531
Your sister
has piggy tails?

17:07.534 --> 17:09.867
You gonna go see Jojo?

17:09.868 --> 17:11.535
Oh...

17:11.537 --> 17:14.505
They're just like
"Pick 'em up Joe."

17:14.507 --> 17:18.775
Look at those pigtails.
I haven't seen that before.

17:18.777 --> 17:21.545
Say,
"They're gettin' long."

17:21.547 --> 17:23.848
Here, Joe, sit here.

17:25.584 --> 17:28.754

Say "night night."

19:58.938 --> 20:01.007
Good night.

20:22.027 --> 20:25.929
This radio is an
at-home way to figure out

20:25.931 --> 20:29.566
if any electrical
appliance is spewing out

20:29.568 --> 20:31.768
electromagnetic fields.

20:31.770 --> 20:34.671
You want one
that's real staticky

20:34.673 --> 20:36.674
and gets between stations.

21:03.835 --> 21:07.071
There's nothing magic
about it.

21:07.073 --> 21:09.806
It's usually enough
if I can find out,

21:09.808 --> 21:12.176
"Hm, that's a really
serious emitter."

21:12.178 --> 21:13.710
And then unplug it.

21:20.152 --> 21:22.652
Get it?

21:25.825 --> 21:27.394
Hi.

21:28.827 --> 21:30.660
I... I hope you're Delaney.

21:30.662 --> 21:32.197
- I am, yeah.
- Hi.

21:33.065 --> 21:35.099
Hi, good to meet you.
Hey, buddy.

21:35.101 --> 21:36.833
Yeah, this is Blackie.

21:36.835 --> 21:39.536
I love your shoes!

21:39.538 --> 21:41.006
Oh, thank you.

21:42.874 --> 21:45.708
Where would
you like to sit?

21:45.710 --> 21:49.679
Um, well... let me see.

21:49.681 --> 21:51.782
You can sit
with Blackie on the bed.

21:51.784 --> 21:53.984
- Uh-huh.
- You can have a chair...

21:53.986 --> 21:56.120
I'll just sit here,
and when we talk,

21:56.122 --> 21:57.822
maybe we can rearrange
a little bit,

21:57.824 --> 21:59.089
but for now,
this is good.

21:59.091 --> 22:00.557
Your coat smells
like cigarettes.

22:00.559 --> 22:02.493
- Does it?
- Yeah.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.094
- Okay, I'll take it off.
- That'd be nice, thanks.

22:05.096 --> 22:07.031
Okay, um, where
should I leave it?

22:07.033 --> 22:09.903
- Outside on that chair.
- Okay.

22:17.008 --> 22:18.876
Delaney do
you like ginger better

22:18.878 --> 22:21.812
or coffee better or both?

22:21.814 --> 22:24.217
- Um, coffee sounds great.
- Okay.

22:25.884 --> 22:28.252
- I still smell cigarettes.
- Okay.

22:28.254 --> 22:32.156
Um... what would
you like me to do?

22:32.158 --> 22:34.658
- I'm not quite sure.
- Okay.

22:34.660 --> 22:37.727
Do you know if it might
be on your clothes or hair?

22:37.729 --> 22:40.163
Well, I don't smoke,
so it would be coming

22:40.165 --> 22:42.935
from the environment,
I guess.

22:44.903 --> 22:45.969
If you wanna smell me,
that's fine.

22:45.971 --> 22:48.572
Maybe you have a social life
and you get to go out

22:48.574 --> 22:50.640
around people who smoke.

22:50.642 --> 22:52.909
I'm gonna get close
to you for just a sec, okay?

22:52.911 --> 22:54.245
Sure.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.213
Shirt.

22:56.215 --> 22:58.983
- It's the blouse, maybe.
- Okay.

22:58.985 --> 23:01.217
Do you mind if I give you
something else to wear?

23:01.219 --> 23:02.855
- No, not at all.
- Okay.

23:04.055 --> 23:05.855
Here, this might
be a good start.

23:05.857 --> 23:06.924
Great, thank you.

23:06.926 --> 23:08.328
Okay.

23:13.298 --> 23:15.801
I really like your shoes.

23:19.005 --> 23:20.803
Could you just
introduce yourself

23:20.805 --> 23:24.207
and talk a little bit
about who you are?

23:24.209 --> 23:28.312
My name's Susan Malloy
and 1992, '94,

23:28.314 --> 23:31.549
was when I first...
moved here,

23:31.551 --> 23:33.751
lock, stock,
and barrel as they'd say.

23:33.753 --> 23:36.820
And I'd been living in
the San Francisco Bay area

23:36.822 --> 23:39.857
for a long time before
that for graduate school

23:39.859 --> 23:41.592
and to work on projects.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.259
Could you
sort of describe the day

23:43.261 --> 23:47.197
or the night
when it all hit you?

23:47.199 --> 23:52.835
Oh, I was with friends,
and I'd had plenty of exposures

23:52.837 --> 23:54.804
to all kinds of things,

23:54.806 --> 23:56.974
but I didn't really think
much of it.

23:56.976 --> 24:01.447
And that night, I felt this
just bizarre feeling in my head.

24:03.149 --> 24:07.554
And my sinuses and the palate
of my mouth and my throat,

24:08.988 --> 24:10.821
all swelled closed.

24:10.823 --> 24:14.691
That was the beginning,
that was the first of many

24:14.693 --> 24:16.960
emergency room visits.

24:16.962 --> 24:20.663
It can be your food,
it can be mold in the bathtub,

24:20.665 --> 24:23.667
it can be anything that
you're sensitive to.

24:23.669 --> 24:26.169
In my case it was chemical.

24:26.171 --> 24:30.006
And soon I found out about
electrical problems, too.

24:30.008 --> 24:31.842
Cleaning products
were impossible.

24:31.844 --> 24:34.078
I learned to use baking soda
for almost everything.

24:34.080 --> 24:38.349
And when I got here,
I didn't have any choice

24:38.351 --> 24:41.251
but to notice I could
walk pretty well.

24:41.253 --> 24:43.019
My gait changed.

24:43.021 --> 24:45.389
My speech cleared up a lot.

24:45.391 --> 24:48.659
I had to admit I felt
a lot better down here

24:48.661 --> 24:51.897
and I had to take
it real seriously.

25:03.642 --> 25:06.877
I got this book.
You know Rush Limbaugh?

25:06.879 --> 25:08.978
He's written this
children's book.

25:08.980 --> 25:10.747
Very interesting.

25:10.749 --> 25:12.649
It's a history
of our country,

25:12.651 --> 25:17.955
and it's... written to children
to show them

25:17.957 --> 25:20.924
how this country's began
and all the pilgrims,

25:20.926 --> 25:23.296
so it's really interesting.

25:24.830 --> 25:26.362
- Hey, Sam!
- Yeah?

25:26.364 --> 25:29.932
- Can you see this?
- Um, yeah.

25:32.371 --> 25:34.007
Isn't that funny?

25:38.978 --> 25:40.246
Wow.

25:43.415 --> 25:46.216
I'm just reading the part
where he's time traveled

25:46.218 --> 25:48.986
back to the Mayflower.

25:48.988 --> 25:51.388
- Huh?
- I'm just reading the part

25:51.390 --> 25:53.424
where they time travel
back to the Mayflower.

25:53.426 --> 25:56.192
Oh, who...
who's traveling?

25:56.194 --> 25:59.263
Well, he's substituting
as a history teacher at school.

25:59.265 --> 26:00.698
Uh-huh.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.434
And so they go on the horse
back in time

26:03.436 --> 26:05.436
to visit all these
different things.

26:05.438 --> 26:06.969
So he's
going back in time?

26:06.971 --> 26:09.305
Yeah.

26:09.307 --> 26:11.074
The horse talks,

26:11.076 --> 26:14.210
and the horse can disappear
if it wants to.

26:14.212 --> 26:15.514
Okay.

26:18.183 --> 26:20.417
It's a good book.

26:20.419 --> 26:23.056
- Did he write it himself?
- Yeah.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.194
That's pretty heavy.

26:30.196 --> 26:32.463
It <i>is</i> heavy,
what happened?

26:42.807 --> 26:46.275
I'm still
doing this at 96.

26:46.277 --> 26:49.979
And there's Sam and Nathan
that their mom is there

26:49.981 --> 26:53.318
to depend on but she won't
always be there, either.

26:59.491 --> 27:02.825
I sometimes feel like I've
helped them to their doom

27:02.827 --> 27:05.496
is how I feel sometimes,
you know.

27:05.498 --> 27:09.067
Which I can't tell
them that, of course.

27:13.838 --> 27:16.340
Cows versus trains, cows.

27:16.342 --> 27:17.507
Oh.

27:17.509 --> 27:19.442
Bartle Hall versus Nelson.

27:19.444 --> 27:21.013
Nelson.

27:22.782 --> 27:23.947
Yeah.

27:23.949 --> 27:26.516
- Do you want company?
- Huh?

27:26.518 --> 27:28.552
Do you want company?

27:28.554 --> 27:30.088
Yeah.

27:42.267 --> 27:45.671
Oh, I'm picking up
some fragrance from you.

27:49.575 --> 27:52.176
Let me see what it is.

27:52.178 --> 27:56.313
I think it's that.
Let me see this.

27:56.315 --> 27:58.881
Just zip it.

27:58.883 --> 28:00.551
I think you're fine like that.

28:00.553 --> 28:02.788
I'm actually gonna
put my hoodie on.

28:13.966 --> 28:16.566
It might not be a bad idea
with the filters kicked down.

28:16.568 --> 28:18.070
Okay.

28:30.615 --> 28:33.550
The easiest way to relate
is that he has

28:33.552 --> 28:36.320
really bizarre food
allergies or, you know,

28:36.322 --> 28:38.589
he's allergic to everything.

28:38.591 --> 28:42.024
But that doesn't
really sum up...

28:42.026 --> 28:43.427
what's going on.

28:43.429 --> 28:45.963
But that's what
people understand.

28:45.965 --> 28:48.497
We weren't ever having
someone's, you know...

28:48.499 --> 28:51.133
the medical community
say it's in his head.

28:51.135 --> 28:53.370
We never had anybody
say that.

28:53.372 --> 28:57.006
However, nobody could
really validate other...

28:57.008 --> 28:59.243
not that it wasn't in his
head or was in his head,

28:59.245 --> 29:01.378
but they couldn't
validate physically

29:01.380 --> 29:04.514
what was going on with him
because the unknown

29:04.516 --> 29:06.617
is just so hard.

29:06.619 --> 29:08.485
You know, it'd be a
lot easier if you knew

29:08.487 --> 29:10.621
that it was gonna
end and, you know,

29:10.623 --> 29:12.622
just not knowing
"Is this ever gonna end?"

29:12.624 --> 29:15.324
And I think that's
where we all kind of are

29:15.326 --> 29:16.959
right now 'cause it
certainly has changed

29:16.961 --> 29:20.198
the family dynamics a lot.

29:26.305 --> 29:28.639
He had had a lot
of blood in his stool

29:28.641 --> 29:31.541
and went to our
family doctor here

29:31.543 --> 29:35.314
who had a colonoscopy ordered,
and they couldn't find anything.

29:36.981 --> 29:40.217
Then he started
having trouble at work

29:40.219 --> 29:42.285
with his colleagues.

29:42.287 --> 29:44.655
Their personal hygiene,
their shampoos,

29:44.657 --> 29:47.024
things like that.

29:47.026 --> 29:50.326
He would notice more
blood in his stools.

29:50.328 --> 29:52.963
His feet and his hands
tingling,

29:52.965 --> 29:55.902
having a really bad headache,
being nauseated all the time.

30:00.139 --> 30:02.505
And I'm starting
to see the correlation.

30:02.507 --> 30:05.108
Whether it's changing
the oil in the car

30:05.110 --> 30:08.480
or painting a room,
you flare up.

30:09.981 --> 30:12.181
And we've really
protected him

30:12.183 --> 30:15.686
against these
chemical sensitives.

30:15.688 --> 30:19.255
But you can't protect
him against, you know,

30:19.257 --> 30:20.957
all the electronics.

30:20.959 --> 30:22.694
He can feel it.

30:28.100 --> 30:33.102
He's pretty isolated,
pretty solitary in what he does.

30:33.104 --> 30:34.705
He's out there
walking just to get

30:34.707 --> 30:38.608
out of the house so that
we can turn on the furnace,

30:38.610 --> 30:40.343
have the washer
and dryer running,

30:40.345 --> 30:43.313
get caught up on finances
so that I have to pay

30:43.315 --> 30:45.384
bills on the internet.

30:47.385 --> 30:49.721
And does he tell you about
when he walks his loops?

30:52.290 --> 30:57.593
He'll say loop one is for Lanie
'cause she's my one true love.

30:57.595 --> 31:02.733
Then when I'm halfway around,
I go, "What number am I on?"

31:02.735 --> 31:06.839
And then I go two,
two is for Joe and Lanie.

31:09.007 --> 31:10.506
Three.

31:10.508 --> 31:12.409
My son has three kids.

31:12.411 --> 31:14.413
Iso, Lucia, Remy.

31:18.217 --> 31:21.051
10 was Lanie's number
in high school,

31:21.053 --> 31:23.889
whenever she played
sports, she was number 10.

31:26.124 --> 31:28.624
Then I can start with Lanie
and end with Lanie,

31:28.626 --> 31:30.462
so I get the whole family.

31:37.068 --> 31:39.236
We're hoping
we get him down to Texas

31:39.238 --> 31:41.737
in these new little
cottages that are made

31:41.739 --> 31:46.543
specially for people with
chemical sensitivities and EMF.

31:46.545 --> 31:49.015
But I think here
we keep him...

31:50.481 --> 31:55.252
more engaged in life
outside of the illness.

31:55.254 --> 31:56.786
I'm worried that
we're gonna lose

31:56.788 --> 31:59.557
that influence with him
once he's down there.

32:03.796 --> 32:06.563
And that sounds kind of harsh,

32:06.565 --> 32:09.801
but I guess you have to know
what he was like before.

32:21.846 --> 32:23.746
Who is it?
Who do you see?

32:23.748 --> 32:27.052
Jojo.
Jojo.

32:30.189 --> 32:31.990
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

32:32.825 --> 32:34.660
You just see Jojo?

33:25.376 --> 33:28.245
For some people, they just
wanna turn back the clock

33:28.247 --> 33:29.778
and see if they can
get their life back

33:29.780 --> 33:32.882
to what it was before
they got sick, and...

33:32.884 --> 33:34.519
that's not possible.

33:38.623 --> 33:40.459
I thought I was gonna be...

33:41.459 --> 33:43.493
maybe an art-history
librarian,

33:43.495 --> 33:48.832
maybe work at a museum,
maybe get to travel more.

33:48.834 --> 33:51.136
I'm glad I got
to travel when I did.

33:53.372 --> 33:56.438
This is what I slept in
when I was in Indonesia.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.274
This is my blanket.

33:58.276 --> 34:01.012
I just love it because it
reminds of sleeping there.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.789
This is a beauty.

34:12.723 --> 34:14.257
It smells really neat.

34:14.259 --> 34:16.659
Sometimes I put water on it,
you know,

34:16.661 --> 34:19.965
and I swear,
you can still smell camel.

34:22.734 --> 34:27.907
And these are from a different
part of my life... you know?

34:29.908 --> 34:35.444
Maybe what I miss
is I had the ability

34:35.446 --> 34:38.616
to take risks in other
places and learn things.

34:39.884 --> 34:42.252
If I would've got
my wish and been able

34:42.254 --> 34:45.056
to be a librarian, you know
what would've happened?

34:46.658 --> 34:49.525
I do.

34:49.527 --> 34:52.562
The museum would've fumigated,

34:52.563 --> 34:55.464
or used preservation chemicals,

34:55.466 --> 34:58.268
or gotten a new carpet,

34:58.270 --> 35:00.904
or done construction
and built on.

35:00.906 --> 35:02.772
Something like that
would've happened,

35:02.774 --> 35:04.777
I would've got sick anyway.

35:19.323 --> 35:24.594
You asked me if I felt
bad about Sam and Nathan...

35:24.596 --> 35:26.529
but I was thinking
about that last night,

35:26.531 --> 35:30.900
and one of the hardest things
for me has been my mom.

35:30.902 --> 35:34.073
Just the effect
on her of all this.

35:36.507 --> 35:39.711
That's been harder for me.

35:46.718 --> 35:49.088
I'm just gonna say goodbye!

35:52.790 --> 35:54.092
You're welcome.

35:55.826 --> 35:58.527
Alright, love you, too!

35:58.529 --> 36:00.964
So I'll see you later!

36:00.966 --> 36:02.534
Bye.

36:03.768 --> 36:06.170
Give you an imaginary hug.

36:19.451 --> 36:22.652
Maybe you could
just elongate "lose?"

36:22.654 --> 36:24.821
It didn't matter to me,
which...

36:24.823 --> 36:29.725
It don't sound like you
totally have it ironed out.

36:29.727 --> 36:31.027
No, I'm gonna
give it a shot here.

36:31.029 --> 36:33.395
Well, it's
kind of a process.

36:39.471 --> 36:42.341

36:44.875 --> 36:50.714

37:36.527 --> 37:38.627
For some reason,
I had the idea that it was,

37:38.629 --> 37:41.630
"Is it fate
or only circumstance?"

37:41.632 --> 37:45.402
Yeah, we had... we didn't...
we had a couple ideas.

37:45.404 --> 37:47.103
Yeah I think you were saying,

37:47.105 --> 37:48.705
"Is fate
just only circumstance,"

37:48.707 --> 37:52.007
or can we, like,
do something about it?

37:52.009 --> 37:54.246
Can we make it a choice?

37:55.814 --> 37:59.716
I don't find illness that
interesting to write about

37:59.718 --> 38:02.484
because usually when
I'm writing, I'm writing

38:02.486 --> 38:05.855
from emotion and it's kind
of just the human experience.

38:05.857 --> 38:10.426
And so, I...
I guess I don't find

38:10.428 --> 38:16.199
the illness is as interesting
as I find... the...

38:16.201 --> 38:19.601
just the human...
the... the...

38:19.603 --> 38:24.140
the way it affects my soul,
I guess, or spirit or...

38:24.142 --> 38:27.143
and what's more interesting,
the cage or the prisoner?

38:44.196 --> 38:45.862
I don't see it.

38:45.864 --> 38:47.897
Okay, I'm gonna have
to ask him where it is

38:47.899 --> 38:50.632
'cause I don't see it.

38:50.634 --> 38:51.936
That's it.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.842
Yes?

39:39.750 --> 39:40.985
The closet?

39:42.120 --> 39:43.719
Yes, was it on?

39:43.721 --> 39:44.989
Yes.

40:10.781 --> 40:15.784
All he can think about now
is somebody's got a cellphone,

40:15.786 --> 40:18.187
how it's gonna hurt him.

40:18.189 --> 40:20.188
I think part of it is
he just doesn't know

40:20.190 --> 40:21.790
what's gonna happen.

40:21.792 --> 40:24.861
A lot of is that
he's really scared.

40:24.863 --> 40:27.062
And so it's tough
when this has never

40:27.064 --> 40:29.998
been our relationship before.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.636
It's kinda like, you know...
I said to him last weekend,

40:33.638 --> 40:36.605
"You have me,
but who do I have?"

40:36.607 --> 40:40.278
You know, 'cause he's not an
emotional support to me anymore.

40:49.053 --> 40:53.323
He was my rock and,
I mean, even to say

40:53.325 --> 40:56.692
"How was work today?"
or "What fun things went on?"

40:56.694 --> 41:00.129
I mean, we... those aren't even
conversations we have anymore.

41:03.667 --> 41:07.036
I just feel like I'm
less some mornings...

41:07.038 --> 41:08.507
when I talk like this.

41:12.643 --> 41:16.379
I just always thought if
I'm gonna say these things,

41:16.381 --> 41:18.246
I'm need to say 'em
to him and I can't say

41:18.248 --> 41:20.085
them to him anymore.

41:44.308 --> 41:46.875
Will anybody
give me a kiss goodbye?

41:46.877 --> 41:48.179
Bye-bye.

41:49.346 --> 41:51.115
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:54.785 --> 41:56.254
I love you girls.

41:57.221 --> 41:58.657
We love you, Jojo!

42:00.725 --> 42:02.125
- Love you, Jojo.
- I love you too, Joycey,

42:02.127 --> 42:03.260
Thank you so much.

42:06.196 --> 42:07.996
Do you wanna put
those supplements in here?

42:07.998 --> 42:09.434
That's what I was gonna do.

44:42.520 --> 44:44.853
You going to D.C.?

44:44.855 --> 44:47.422
You going to D.C. right?

44:47.424 --> 44:49.158
You gonna take the long train?
Just one-way?

44:49.160 --> 44:52.197
All right, she needs to...

48:20.171 --> 48:21.770
This is
our daughter, Meg.

48:21.772 --> 48:24.739
- You haven't met Meg.
- Hi.

48:24.741 --> 48:29.111
All of the Internet and TV
comes into the mechanical room

48:29.113 --> 48:32.480
and I can shut it off there
for people who don't want it.

48:32.482 --> 48:35.451
I have TV and Internet
in there right now.

48:35.453 --> 48:37.585
So if you want that one,
I need to shut it off

48:37.587 --> 48:42.190
in the mechanical room so it
doesn't come into the building.

48:42.192 --> 48:44.092
And this one doesn't
have it right now because

48:44.094 --> 48:47.129
- a person didn't want it, so...
- Okay.

48:51.768 --> 48:54.972
- Do you want the lights off?
- Yeah.

48:57.207 --> 48:58.540
You shut this off,
there's no power

48:58.542 --> 49:01.176
going to that
over there in the bedroom.

49:01.178 --> 49:03.645
Same thing with this,
you shut this off,

49:03.647 --> 49:05.346
there's no power
going to that.

49:05.348 --> 49:07.315
And there are no
other plugs in here

49:07.317 --> 49:11.755
so you're plugless
and outlet-less in here.

49:13.390 --> 49:17.326
All the walls have double foil
and copper wiring,

49:17.328 --> 49:19.594
and the windows
are all grounded.

49:19.596 --> 49:23.332
EMF people get those EMF mats
that they put on their beds.

49:23.334 --> 49:26.801
You're supposed to ground 'em,
so we just put

49:26.803 --> 49:30.839
a grounding rod in before
we pour the foundation.

49:30.841 --> 49:34.176
EMF mats
that you just sleep on?

49:34.178 --> 49:37.645
Mm-hmm.
It's supposed to ground you.

49:37.647 --> 49:39.748
Well,
with the double magnesium,

49:39.750 --> 49:42.183
you can't get
a cellphone signal in here,

49:42.185 --> 49:45.788
and you're not gonna get
anything from the outside.

49:45.790 --> 49:49.827
And all of the wirings
underground's in-conduit.

49:50.861 --> 49:53.597
There's no wires in the walls.

49:55.366 --> 49:57.399
I'm picking a little bit
of fragrance up in here.

49:57.401 --> 50:00.301
I don't know what...
what it is.

50:00.303 --> 50:04.406
I think it's
the potassium silicate paint.

50:04.408 --> 50:06.510
It's basically clay.

50:08.879 --> 50:10.379
You know,
I suppose something...

50:10.381 --> 50:12.449
it could have an odor
or not.

50:27.598 --> 50:30.866
"Dear Mike and Bonnie,

50:30.868 --> 50:34.703
"For months, I've been
wanting to write or call

50:34.705 --> 50:38.274
but days keep being too short
and too tiring

50:38.276 --> 50:40.542
and going by in a fog.

50:40.544 --> 50:43.511
That is the hardest
part of this illness.

50:43.513 --> 50:45.714
It affects the brain so much

50:45.716 --> 50:48.420
and imprisons us
inside ourselves.

50:50.421 --> 50:52.187
When you're that impaired,
it can really

50:52.189 --> 50:54.957
make you feel like dirt.

50:54.959 --> 50:56.859
For instance,
going to the store each day,

50:56.861 --> 50:59.694
"people usually notice
that you're not acting

50:59.696 --> 51:01.429
like everyone else,

51:01.431 --> 51:03.431
but they don't really know
what's going on.

51:03.433 --> 51:04.866
Things like wandering
around the store

51:04.868 --> 51:07.203
and not being able
to make a decision.

51:07.205 --> 51:08.904
Not being able to talk
straight and generally

51:08.906 --> 51:10.973
looking and feeling
like something

51:10.975 --> 51:12.908
that the cat dragged in.

51:12.910 --> 51:16.312
People can be very impatient
and unkind at these times,

51:16.314 --> 51:18.446
and when you're
already not feeling well

51:18.448 --> 51:21.716
you begin to feel like
the scum of the earth."

There's a lot
of issues in there.

53:44.428 --> 53:46.761
Find the ones
you're passionate about.

53:46.763 --> 53:48.763
That's what you want
to talk about

53:48.765 --> 53:51.667
as an individual advocate
if you get an opportunity

53:51.669 --> 53:54.002
to talk to your legislator.

53:54.004 --> 53:56.138
If you all have questions

53:56.140 --> 53:58.574
that the subcommittees

catch up with 'em.

54:00.410 --> 54:02.511
You see their faces.
They're gonna be around today.

54:02.513 --> 54:05.614
We're gonna have caucus sessions
this afternoon.

54:05.616 --> 54:07.683
It's a perfect time
to grab one of 'em

54:07.685 --> 54:12.721
if you have a question
and delve into things deeper.

54:12.723 --> 54:15.056
I definitely will be
using you as a consultant.

54:15.058 --> 54:18.527
See, a lot of these
Mexican kids that grew up

54:18.529 --> 54:20.895
- in migrant farm camps?
- Yeah.

54:20.897 --> 54:22.531
- I'm one of them.
- They're sprayed.

54:22.533 --> 54:24.866
I used to work in California,
in Del Nuevas,

54:24.868 --> 54:28.036
Sultana, in the grapes
and the orchards

54:28.038 --> 54:29.837
and they used to spray those.

54:29.839 --> 54:31.873
See, I was eight to 12 years
old when I work on that

54:31.875 --> 54:35.978
As a result I only have
40% of my lung capacity.

54:35.980 --> 54:37.879
- See?
- Oh, no.

54:37.881 --> 54:40.748
But we... we were all
in there earning a living.

54:40.750 --> 54:43.185
Farmers in the state,
they never bothered

54:43.187 --> 54:46.721
to put out these signs
saying "Environmental hazard"

54:46.723 --> 54:49.824
or never held the ranchers
to any... any standards.

54:49.826 --> 54:52.828
- Yeah.
- So I definitely will support

54:52.830 --> 54:54.996
what you're doing
and get involved with it.

54:54.998 --> 54:57.732
Are you familiar with
the Willamette Valley in Oregon?

54:57.734 --> 54:59.500
- Yes, absolutely.
- I used to work there

54:59.502 --> 55:01.437
in the summers
when I was a kid

55:01.439 --> 55:04.205
picking string beans
and strawberries.

55:04.207 --> 55:06.141
- Strawberries, I did, too.
- All the stuff.

55:06.143 --> 55:08.109
- We'll talk some more.
- Good to meet you, yeah.

55:08.111 --> 55:09.978
- Good to meet you.
- Okay, see ya.

55:09.980 --> 55:11.215
See ya.

55:45.716 --> 55:47.716
Yeah, you may be
the first person

55:47.718 --> 55:51.853
in the last two years
that has said that...

55:51.855 --> 55:55.790
I'm chem...
that I am fragrant.

55:55.792 --> 55:58.962
It's unbelievable that you're
telling us we're fragrant.

56:13.777 --> 56:15.544
It's bullshit.

56:15.546 --> 56:18.779
She's basically saying
"stay away from my unit."

56:18.781 --> 56:21.750
And I'm saying,
if I don't have the right

56:21.752 --> 56:27.492
to move around anywhere
on these premises, fuck you.

56:34.031 --> 56:38.065
Especially if the reason
is I'm fragrant.

56:38.067 --> 56:39.935
I'm already pissed
that I don't have...

56:39.937 --> 56:42.170
that I know she doesn't want me
near that unit.

56:42.172 --> 56:45.109
I just cann... you c...
you just know it.

56:47.844 --> 56:50.212
Well, yeah, she was waitin'
for us when we came out.

56:50.214 --> 56:53.147
She was lookin' out the...
out the...

56:53.149 --> 56:55.650
From this side... yeah,
outside of...

56:55.652 --> 56:57.118
from the sidewalk,

56:57.120 --> 56:59.587
it's basically
community property.

56:59.589 --> 57:03.190
But you... you know,
when you violate their space,

57:03.192 --> 57:05.928
then you run the risk of them
doing something

57:05.930 --> 57:09.163
that you can't deal with.

57:09.165 --> 57:11.199
She had her cellphone
in a plastic bag.

57:11.201 --> 57:13.403
Yeah, she probably
doesn't like the smell.

57:16.674 --> 57:18.806
So she probably doesn't
have the electric problem.

57:18.808 --> 57:21.310
She probably
doesn't like the smell.

57:21.312 --> 57:24.045
So she probably
is more sensitive.

57:24.047 --> 57:25.714
And maybe we have...

57:25.716 --> 57:27.683
you guys have all been
in Whole Foods.

57:27.685 --> 57:30.085
We probably <i>are</i> fragrant,
truth be told.

57:30.087 --> 57:32.754
I should understand that
better than I do,

57:32.756 --> 57:35.056
but it's a what of crazies.

57:35.058 --> 57:38.960
- Concentration.
- Concentration of crazies.

57:38.962 --> 57:40.761
That... that's not fair,
though, I think...

57:40.763 --> 57:42.330
I mean, that's not fair.

57:42.332 --> 57:43.998
- It's not <i>all</i> fair.
- No.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.134
But there's truth to it.

57:46.136 --> 57:50.371
No, it... I think it's
just everybody's issues

57:50.373 --> 57:53.107
- are so... so...
- Concentration of very ill people

57:53.109 --> 57:56.243
who all have to protect
themselves in different ways.

57:56.245 --> 57:58.381
I don't know.

58:02.319 --> 58:03.887
I don't know.

58:11.761 --> 58:14.929
I don't know,
I think about being here

58:14.931 --> 58:16.797
and tolerating it
by yourself,

58:16.799 --> 58:18.933
or being at home
and tolerating it

58:18.935 --> 58:22.004
and knowing that you have
family and granddaughters

58:22.006 --> 58:24.641
and all of this
swarming around...

58:26.377 --> 58:30.178
I don't know... why you would
make that choice.

58:30.180 --> 58:34.915
I agree but I think
that if he would stay here

58:34.917 --> 58:38.185
for a little bit,
he would regain

58:38.187 --> 58:41.123
some of his independence,
and it would be easier on you.

58:41.125 --> 58:44.359
Like, if he were here
by himself even for a month,

58:44.361 --> 58:46.661
he would be forced to cook
for himself

58:46.663 --> 58:48.632
and realize
that he <i>can</i> do it.

58:51.134 --> 58:53.637
But... I don't know.

58:55.138 --> 58:59.440
Well... everything,
for the last two years

58:59.442 --> 59:02.210
has been about him,

59:02.212 --> 59:07.848
and I just do
whatever I can to...

59:07.850 --> 59:10.451
for him, that I...
that...

59:10.453 --> 59:13.688
what I need or want or...
doesn't really

59:13.690 --> 59:16.257
play into the picture
right now.

59:16.259 --> 59:20.261
I guess that waits until after
he's healed if he's gonna heal.

59:20.263 --> 59:21.598
I don't...
I don't know.

59:29.138 --> 59:32.940
I don't think
that's healthy, though, mom.

59:32.942 --> 59:37.179
Because... I don't know
that he's ever gonna be

59:37.181 --> 59:40.748
exactly how he was before.

59:40.750 --> 59:42.686
And I don't think
it's fair for you...

59:44.855 --> 59:46.390
to just...

59:48.292 --> 59:50.458
like, you guys have to find
a new normal together,

59:50.460 --> 59:53.428
and it shouldn't be
just you doing everything

59:53.430 --> 59:56.132
at his beck and call.

01:00:13.049 --> 01:00:14.882
You know,
from the inside of my head,

01:00:14.884 --> 01:00:18.722
it feels very hard
and not working very well.

01:00:21.457 --> 01:00:26.262
We have a few places
that are the possibility areas.

01:00:27.263 --> 01:00:29.330
We need to be somewhat rural,

01:00:29.332 --> 01:00:31.399
but there are places
like in the Verde Valley

01:00:31.401 --> 01:00:35.036
where you're kind of rural
even though you're near, like...

01:00:35.038 --> 01:00:38.205
even though you're maybe
less than five miles away from...

01:00:38.207 --> 01:00:41.109
Yeah, and there's a lot
of forest lands around

01:00:41.111 --> 01:00:42.444
so that it...
there's open spaces a lot.

01:00:42.446 --> 01:00:44.212
Yeah,
there's more spread out.

01:00:44.214 --> 01:00:46.047
It's not the suburbs,
you know.

01:00:46.049 --> 01:00:48.783
We know a couple people
that live there already.

01:00:48.785 --> 01:00:50.518
One lady in particular.

01:00:53.422 --> 01:00:57.695
We're trying to find somewhere
that would work for us.

ADAbasics.org
and go there and check it out.

01:02:24.614 --> 01:02:28.149
Beginner's course
on the law, on the ADA.

01:02:28.151 --> 01:02:30.351
Now, just a second, Susan.

01:02:30.353 --> 01:02:32.620
This is beyond beginning ADA.

01:02:32.622 --> 01:02:35.056
This is surveying
for accessibility

01:02:35.058 --> 01:02:36.625
and how to do assessments

01:02:36.627 --> 01:02:39.527
and protect all of our
credibility in the community.

01:02:39.529 --> 01:02:41.062
Susan?

01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:43.964
Okay, I think one
thing that would help us

01:02:43.966 --> 01:02:46.234
would be when you make
a sta...

01:02:46.236 --> 01:02:50.471
when someone makes
a statement like...

01:02:50.473 --> 01:02:53.141
that the... you know,
the lighting in the walls

01:02:53.143 --> 01:02:56.011
and the type of carpet
and so forth

01:02:56.013 --> 01:02:58.679
doesn't impact accessibility.

01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:00.582
I think it's helpful to say,

01:03:00.584 --> 01:03:04.219
"except for certain people,
for whom those are barriers,"

01:03:04.221 --> 01:03:07.554
and then go ahead
and explain it to a degree.

01:03:07.556 --> 01:03:09.658
And I appreciate
your comment.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:13.127
Susan and I
go back a few years

01:03:13.129 --> 01:03:18.033
in working on multiple
chemical sensitivity,

01:03:18.035 --> 01:03:22.170
electromagnetic
sensitivity, MCS, CS issues,

01:03:22.172 --> 01:03:24.105
and she has taught me so much.

01:03:24.107 --> 01:03:26.942
I appreciate your input,
and what I may do

01:03:26.944 --> 01:03:29.643
is reach out to you
later on this year

01:03:29.645 --> 01:03:32.179
as I'm finalizing
the agendas

01:03:32.181 --> 01:03:34.649
and run it by you
as far as your input.

01:03:34.651 --> 01:03:36.384
Thanks for your question.

01:03:36.386 --> 01:03:38.719
Let's keep moving,
so I can cover everything

01:03:38.721 --> 01:03:41.323
on this, and then if I've
got a couple minutes at the end,

01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:43.561
we're gonna
for Q and A...

01:03:47.163 --> 01:03:48.596
I want them to come to you.

01:03:48.598 --> 01:03:50.297
I don't want them to come to me

01:03:50.299 --> 01:03:53.201
'cause I'm not the end-all
expert on this,

01:03:53.203 --> 01:03:58.339
but you guys are,
and by referring them to you,

01:03:58.341 --> 01:04:01.375
it gives you an opportunity
to not only share the message,

01:04:01.377 --> 01:04:03.611
but to grow the network

01:04:03.613 --> 01:04:07.181
and add credibility
to the network.

01:04:07.183 --> 01:04:10.150
If I can turn 'em on
to somebody who's a real expert

01:04:10.152 --> 01:04:12.152
on the issue,
I wanna be able to do that

01:04:12.154 --> 01:04:14.022
'cause then I can go work
on something else

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:16.458
where I don't have somebody
to refer them to.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:19.560
But you know what, it helps
when it comes out of your mouth.

01:04:19.562 --> 01:04:22.663
- But the referral will help.
- Really a lot.

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:25.466
If I'm... if I'm able to...
if they're coming to me

01:04:25.468 --> 01:04:30.205
because they think I'm the...
the all-wise Mark

01:04:30.207 --> 01:04:32.440
and I say,
"Here's a resource for you

01:04:32.442 --> 01:04:36.544
that you've been looking for,
and she's a buddy of mine."

01:04:36.546 --> 01:04:40.714
Start right away sending me
the stuff you're talking about

01:04:40.716 --> 01:04:43.653
that you think is appropriate
for me to look at.

01:04:45.522 --> 01:04:47.721
Molding
into the curriculum,

01:04:47.723 --> 01:04:50.058
and then once
I start to mold it,

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.129
I'm gonna send an outline
to you to say,

01:04:54.131 --> 01:04:56.563
"Susan, what do you think
of this?"

01:04:56.565 --> 01:04:59.199
- Love ya.
- Wanna give you a high one?

01:04:59.201 --> 01:05:01.069
- What's this?
- High one.

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:03.404
High one?
Excellent.

01:05:03.406 --> 01:05:05.473
I've learned a new one today.
Thank you.

01:05:05.475 --> 01:05:08.243
That's when you
have low expectations.

01:05:08.245 --> 01:05:10.347
Oh, really?

01:05:34.171 --> 01:05:37.772
I feel like I'm
in this all by myself.

01:05:37.774 --> 01:05:40.778
I feel like
I'm doing this all by myself.

01:05:45.415 --> 01:05:50.652
So I...
and... and I know... I'm not.

01:05:50.654 --> 01:05:55.255
I mean, everyone
tells me how lucky I am

01:05:55.257 --> 01:05:58.625
to have the support
system I have.

01:05:58.627 --> 01:06:01.161
And I know... I know I have
a support system.

01:06:01.163 --> 01:06:03.263
And I can tell people
that I have

01:06:03.265 --> 01:06:07.669
a fantastic support system,
but when I go to bed at night,

01:06:07.671 --> 01:06:13.641
I still feel like it's
me that is in this room.

01:06:13.643 --> 01:06:16.411
It's me
who is stuck like this.

01:06:16.413 --> 01:06:19.214
You're not
the only one that's lonely.

01:06:19.216 --> 01:06:20.884
So don't...
you can't play that card.

01:06:22.852 --> 01:06:24.451
You're not
gonna be happy until...

01:06:24.453 --> 01:06:26.453
or unless we're all sick,
too.

01:06:26.455 --> 01:06:27.754
- No.
- Yes.

01:06:27.756 --> 01:06:29.492
No.

01:06:41.471 --> 01:06:43.140
This is kind of how I feel.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.806
And I can't say it.

01:06:45.808 --> 01:06:47.443
No, go ahead.

01:06:48.344 --> 01:06:49.913
It's all right.

01:06:57.821 --> 01:06:59.856
T-tell me.

01:07:11.567 --> 01:07:13.801
You might as well tell me,
this is gonna...

01:07:13.803 --> 01:07:16.538
It's just
gonna open up a whole...

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.041
I don't know.

01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.688
Tell me.

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:38.225
No, I... I'm just... it...
it doesn't matter.

01:07:38.227 --> 01:07:39.960
It's like it doesn't matter
how much we suffer,

01:07:39.962 --> 01:07:41.929
you're just never
gonna give us credit

01:07:41.931 --> 01:07:45.168
for anything that we've done
to help you along the way.

01:07:50.272 --> 01:07:53.574
You've turned this into
something that's all about you,

01:07:53.576 --> 01:07:55.542
and you don't even think
about

01:07:55.544 --> 01:07:57.578
how it's impacted
everybody else.

01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:00.515
You don't <i>care</i>
how it's impacted anybody else

01:08:00.517 --> 01:08:04.021
because all you care about
is how it's impacted you.

01:08:14.830 --> 01:08:17.663
If you ever get better,

01:08:17.666 --> 01:08:20.871
it's all gonna be something
you did all by yourself.

01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.249
You don't hear me
when I say...

01:08:35.251 --> 01:08:38.285
my wife has stood by me
so unbelievably,

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:40.587
- my wife takes showers...
- You say that, but you don't...

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:43.624
I mean, you say that
to people in passing but it's...

01:08:43.626 --> 01:08:46.460
you never, ever...

01:08:46.462 --> 01:08:48.996
I mean. it's just like
one of those things you say

01:08:48.997 --> 01:08:51.031
because we're all standing here
and they have no one.

01:08:51.033 --> 01:08:54.368
So it's kind of like
a feather in your cap,

01:08:54.371 --> 01:08:57.707
but you don't make us feel
like that day to day to day.

01:10:43.846 --> 01:10:46.149
I'm a self-centered bastard.

01:11:15.111 --> 01:11:17.677
Something else that you're
gonna have to tell Earl

01:11:17.679 --> 01:11:20.080
is that the reception
is so bad out here

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:24.451
and people have to go outside
to use their cellphones.

01:11:24.453 --> 01:11:27.588
Well, it's true,
that's what it is.

01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:29.826
Not people
trying to be mean.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.429
I'm sorry, Lanie.
I do appreciate...

01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:38.001
I know how hard you work for me,
and I appreciate it.

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:42.838
I'm sorry.

01:11:45.974 --> 01:11:47.411
Are you crying?

01:11:56.719 --> 01:11:59.052
Hey, Nick, this is your dad.

01:11:59.054 --> 01:12:03.758
We're gonna get up early
in the morning and head back.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.395
Okay, bye-bye.

01:13:42.825 --> 01:13:44.659
I'm 63 years old,

01:13:44.661 --> 01:13:48.596
and I've finally learned
to take a hint.

01:13:48.598 --> 01:13:51.832
I just wanna work
with people

01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:55.602
who are listening
or who ask for help,

01:13:55.604 --> 01:13:58.271
not... not try to...

01:13:58.273 --> 01:14:00.908
push my values on society.

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:02.209
That hasn't worked.

01:14:02.211 --> 01:14:04.981
I just had illusions
about it working.

01:14:13.221 --> 01:14:15.890
We might as well
get out of town

01:14:15.892 --> 01:14:19.429
and sort of make lives
for ourselves that don't hurt.

01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:23.533
Look after our own.

01:14:47.724 --> 01:14:51.959
All I know
is people who are EMF...

01:14:51.961 --> 01:14:55.795
use this and swear by it.

01:14:55.797 --> 01:14:58.065
That's about
all I can tell you.

01:14:58.067 --> 01:15:00.834
Yeah, I mean
this is pretty typical.

01:15:00.836 --> 01:15:03.303
So turning all
the breakers off

01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:05.640
and then pulling one
neutral at a time

01:15:05.642 --> 01:15:08.209
and testing, that's...
that does... that sounds...

01:15:08.211 --> 01:15:10.910
Oh, yeah,
that's real easy to do.

01:15:10.912 --> 01:15:13.313
- Okay.
- We absolutely can do that.

01:15:13.315 --> 01:15:18.018
My wife has to do
all the cooking for me.

01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.388
And if I could start
doing some of my own cooking,

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:24.325
she would be so happy.

01:15:24.327 --> 01:15:26.761
Well, I do realize
in your situations,

01:15:26.763 --> 01:15:29.829
little things
do affect you.

01:15:29.831 --> 01:15:34.067
I mean,
I can't understand... how.

01:15:34.069 --> 01:15:37.340
But, I mean, I'm aware,
little things do affect you.

01:15:47.082 --> 01:15:49.784
"Effects
of electromagnetic fields

01:15:49.786 --> 01:15:52.085
on the immune system."

01:15:52.087 --> 01:15:55.955
"Department of Neuroscience,
Karolinska Institute,

01:15:55.957 --> 01:15:57.493
Stockholm, Sweden."

01:15:59.961 --> 01:16:02.762
"In summary, it is evident
from our preliminary

01:16:02.764 --> 01:16:05.999
experimental data that
various biological alternations

01:16:06.001 --> 01:16:09.169
are present in EHS persons

01:16:09.171 --> 01:16:11.771
claiming to suffer
from exposure to EMF.

01:16:11.773 --> 01:16:15.875
The alternations are themselves
enough to fully explain

01:16:15.877 --> 01:16:18.378
the electrical
hyper-sensitivity symptoms,

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:21.417
and the involvement of
the immune system is evident."

01:16:24.487 --> 01:16:29.423
I want a paper from
someone talking about

01:16:29.425 --> 01:16:31.424
what to do about it.

01:16:31.426 --> 01:16:33.460
It doesn't exist.

01:16:33.462 --> 01:16:36.699
What the... what you can do
to help yourself.

01:16:38.367 --> 01:16:40.403
It doesn't exist.

01:16:47.109 --> 01:16:50.410
The fact that there's a paper
that doesn't say

01:16:50.412 --> 01:16:51.878
it's all in your head...

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.183
you should be happy with.

01:17:17.239 --> 01:17:19.205

01:17:26.815 --> 01:17:30.351
Nothing.
This could be good.

01:17:30.353 --> 01:17:33.553
Maybe everybody's okay!

01:17:42.165 --> 01:17:44.999
The people I know
who have impeccable houses

01:17:45.001 --> 01:17:47.433
with no chemicals in them
and the electricity's perfect

01:17:47.435 --> 01:17:51.173
and so forth,
I don't see them getting well.

01:17:54.977 --> 01:17:58.044
Goblin! Goblin!

01:17:58.046 --> 01:17:59.581
Goblin!

01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:03.883
The people I know
who've gotten better

01:18:03.885 --> 01:18:07.855
or at least stabilize
have a lot of love

01:18:07.857 --> 01:18:10.891
and sharing and...
and maybe prayer

01:18:10.893 --> 01:18:13.927
or whatever you wanna call it
in their lives,

01:18:13.929 --> 01:18:16.331
seem to come out quite well.

01:18:21.237 --> 01:18:24.204
In at least the last two
or three months,

01:18:24.206 --> 01:18:25.905
he's held pretty steady,

01:18:25.907 --> 01:18:29.843
and his chemical sensitives
have gotten better.

01:18:29.845 --> 01:18:32.847
He has maybe not healed,
but he's been able

01:18:32.849 --> 01:18:35.685
to participate in life a little
bit more than in the past.

01:18:37.486 --> 01:18:39.887
We're able to take
a breath and say,

01:18:39.889 --> 01:18:43.393
"Okay, now we're ready for
the next part of this journey."

01:18:47.496 --> 01:18:50.530
I remember telling him,
you know,

01:18:50.532 --> 01:18:52.399
you're gonna get well
from all this,

01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:54.334
and I'm gonna have all
this emotional baggage

01:18:54.336 --> 01:18:56.605
that I'm not gonna know
what to do with.

01:18:59.975 --> 01:19:02.444
What do I do
with how I'm feeling?

01:19:03.912 --> 01:19:06.512
I don't know
what to do with it.

01:19:33.341 --> 01:19:36.142
It seems like
you're supposed to care

01:19:36.144 --> 01:19:41.884
for your own people regardless
of what people think.

01:19:43.519 --> 01:19:48.224
That's...
you know, that's all.
