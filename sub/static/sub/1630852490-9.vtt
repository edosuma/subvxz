It's my song.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.500
Kim Jenna...

01:15.200 --> 01:16.610
- This song...
- Do you...

01:16.710 --> 01:18.740
...know what you're saying?

01:23.880 --> 01:24.980
I'm sorry.

01:25.980 --> 01:26.950
But...

01:28.600 --> 01:31.150
It has a similar vibe to my song.

01:32.289 --> 01:33.660
How similar?

01:33.660 --> 01:34.259
I can't be sure...

01:34.259 --> 01:36.289
You just said it was your song.

01:36.289 --> 01:38.390
Then that means it's identical.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.060
No. It's not identical.

01:42.160 --> 01:44.729
I'm also flustered about why I said that.

01:44.729 --> 01:47.140
Give me your song. Let me listen to it.

01:48.470 --> 01:50.170
Your music video is awesome, right?

01:50.170 --> 01:52.009
We spent a lot of money.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.840
Jenna!

01:55.840 --> 01:58.110
Why are you here? You have a doppelganger?

01:58.979 --> 02:01.350
You're everywhere.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.680
What's going on?

02:05.550 --> 02:06.550
What?

02:07.190 --> 02:08.460
Did something happen?

02:08.720 --> 02:10.729
Why do you both look upset?

02:11.330 --> 02:12.760
What is it this time?

02:28.210 --> 02:29.579
Where are you?

02:29.950 --> 02:31.280
Should I go pick you up?

You wore the dress I bought you, right?

03:00.610 --> 03:01.840
Don't go any further!

03:04.310 --> 03:05.310
You...

03:09.650 --> 03:11.090
Why are you here?

03:12.190 --> 03:14.090
I followed you from the study room.

03:14.090 --> 03:15.320
Are you crazy?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.320
Don't go.

03:16.960 --> 03:17.860
Stop.

03:17.860 --> 03:20.000
What do you care?

03:22.200 --> 03:23.170
Leave.

03:29.340 --> 03:30.840
We finished recording.

03:32.810 --> 03:34.710
So what?

03:37.079 --> 03:39.820
I left your part blank, so...

03:41.380 --> 03:44.020
You fill it. You fill it!

03:44.190 --> 03:45.190
Don't go inside!

03:45.390 --> 03:46.820
I'll do it!

03:46.820 --> 03:48.720

05:12.770 --> 05:15.310
There are similar parts in the melody.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.080
But it won't be a problem.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.250
It will be a problem.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.020
The unit's song will be released first.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.750
Then Cotton Candy will suffer great damage.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.090
What do you mean, "damage?"

05:26.860 --> 05:28.260
What?

05:28.520 --> 05:29.360
Sir...

05:29.360 --> 05:30.660
You must know this,

05:32.090 --> 05:34.159
but our first teaser was already released.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.360
The music video mastering is almost done.

05:36.970 --> 05:38.930
It's too late to go back on it.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.700
What do you think?

05:46.210 --> 05:47.380
I think Ray...

05:50.180 --> 05:51.180
is right.

05:53.980 --> 05:55.950
What do you mean, the song is the same?

05:55.950 --> 05:57.520
It's not exactly the same.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.020
The melody line is similar.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.720
What? How can that be similar?

06:04.030 --> 06:04.890
Hey.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.800
Did you copy ours?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.030
I told you to keep confidentiality.

06:09.230 --> 06:10.200
Who was it?

06:10.430 --> 06:12.300
Who leaked our song to them?

06:12.730 --> 06:13.800
Was it you, Ji-han?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.370
Or you, Ray?

06:17.740 --> 06:18.540
Hey.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.510
Stop that nonsense.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.810
That song...

06:22.610 --> 06:24.650
Jenna wrote that a long time ago.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.320
Then?

06:30.020 --> 06:30.890
Huh?

06:31.420 --> 06:33.920
Are you saying I plagiarized her song?

06:34.090 --> 06:35.120
Did she say that?

06:35.890 --> 06:36.830
Hey!

06:37.090 --> 06:38.260
Kim Jenna!

06:38.830 --> 06:40.130
Get a grip.

06:40.130 --> 06:42.330
Before you brought that song to me,

06:42.830 --> 06:44.670
I gave my song to them first.

06:45.330 --> 06:46.430
Aren't I right?

06:47.470 --> 06:48.370
You're right.

06:48.370 --> 06:49.470
Heard that?

06:51.210 --> 06:53.240
How dare you accuse me of plagiarism.

06:53.780 --> 06:54.440
Huh?

06:54.440 --> 06:55.710
Executive Bong!

06:57.909 --> 07:00.550
Kim Jenna never said you plagiarized.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.060
Why are you overreacting?

07:05.470 --> 07:06.520
I got angry.

07:06.760 --> 07:07.990
Did you hear that?

07:08.860 --> 07:11.160
If you think Executive Bong plagiarized,

07:11.330 --> 07:14.160
the timeline doesn't add up.

07:17.970 --> 07:19.230
Jenna had

07:20.700 --> 07:22.840
sent that song to CEO Ma.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.010
Hey.

07:30.850 --> 07:32.310
What do you want to say?

07:32.310 --> 07:34.220
She sent the song. So what?

07:34.220 --> 07:36.220
Stop that, huh?

07:36.650 --> 07:37.850
Let him go.

07:40.560 --> 07:41.620
Kim Jenna.

07:44.730 --> 07:47.659
It's too late to change the unit's schedule.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.070
But if we proceed like this,

07:52.070 --> 07:53.870
Cotton Candy will be accused of plagiarism.

07:53.870 --> 07:55.040
That's why

07:56.440 --> 07:58.510
Cotton Candy changing their song

07:59.409 --> 08:01.840
is the most reasonable solution.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.540
Sir...

08:02.540 --> 08:04.280
Is there another way?

08:07.950 --> 08:09.480
Stay behind, Kim Jenna.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.090
The rest of you, leave.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.920
Let's go.

08:28.170 --> 08:29.140
Hey.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.940
What did you mean back there?

08:31.940 --> 08:34.610
So she sent the song to CEO Ma? So what?

08:34.610 --> 08:36.480
Stop it, seriously!

08:38.250 --> 08:39.809
That's enough.

08:44.150 --> 08:47.190
Bbiyong. Stop it.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.990
Those bastards.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.130
Hey.

08:58.670 --> 08:59.430
Hey!

08:59.430 --> 09:00.840
Stop it.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.640
Ji-han!

09:05.840 --> 09:07.110
Seo Ji-han!

09:08.210 --> 09:10.250
Who are you mad at?

09:11.150 --> 09:13.250
This is a totally different matter from before.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.120
It's not a matter of helping someone.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.250
It's not something we can just give up.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.190
I know.

09:26.730 --> 09:29.430
I will not take a step back on this matter.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.450
Drink this, Troy.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.520
Troy.

09:50.190 --> 09:53.120
This won't be solved by acting stubbornly.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.960
This is different from letting you collab.

09:57.390 --> 09:58.930
We can't give up on it.

09:58.930 --> 10:00.600
There will be so much speculation.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.430
We're going to go public soon.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.200
The board will go berserk if they found out.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Yoon!

10:06.500 --> 10:10.340
Bbiyong that bastard stole Jenna's song!

10:11.410 --> 10:12.640
Troy.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.710
Watch what you say. Huh?

10:14.880 --> 10:17.410
You might get sued for slander.

10:17.710 --> 10:19.650
Let's not do this.

10:28.790 --> 10:29.790
We...

10:30.390 --> 10:31.260
We...

10:32.990 --> 10:34.270
Can't change our song.

10:35.360 --> 10:36.300
We...

10:38.200 --> 10:39.170
Won't.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.500
If you can't?

10:40.940 --> 10:44.010
You must've heard what would happen.

10:44.510 --> 10:48.280
How meaningful is that song to Cotton Candy?

10:48.580 --> 10:50.480
There is nothing more meaningful

10:52.110 --> 10:54.120
than stopping a catastrophe.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.310
You're right.

11:20.410 --> 11:22.710
You said nothing wrong.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.480
But still...

11:25.980 --> 11:27.120
Still...

11:28.050 --> 11:31.290
Can't you say you'll try to find a way?

11:31.620 --> 11:35.190
If you can't, why did you pretend you could?

11:36.060 --> 11:37.060
No.

11:37.390 --> 11:39.030
We were idiots.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.130
I now realize

11:41.430 --> 11:45.070
your shade offers nobody respite.

11:45.630 --> 11:46.530
No.

11:46.800 --> 11:50.000
I doubt you had one in the first place.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.440
No. 69 "White Day"

12:10.290 --> 12:12.190
We might actually make history

12:12.190 --> 12:13.630
in climbing back up the charts!

12:13.630 --> 12:16.160
Looks like we'll make it into the top 50 soon.

12:17.430 --> 12:18.330
There's "Honest," too.

12:18.330 --> 12:19.030
Where?

12:18.570 --> 12:19.270
No. 75 "Honest"

12:19.030 --> 12:20.970
No. 75?

12:24.570 --> 12:25.410
Oh, my.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.440
What's up with you?

12:26.440 --> 12:27.780
Welcome home.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.350
What's up?

12:30.980 --> 12:32.150
Have you gone mad?

12:32.150 --> 12:33.680
No, it's just...

12:33.950 --> 12:36.420
If our new song becomes No.1 and old song No.2,

12:36.420 --> 12:38.420
it'll be so exhausting.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.890
News articles will say Cotton's enemy is Cotton.

12:41.890 --> 12:43.560
Oh, what will we do?

12:43.560 --> 12:47.000
Seriously, that'll be so annoying.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.260
Yeah.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.230
Did you see it, Jenna? It's amazing!

12:50.230 --> 12:52.600
It's awesome. Come look.

13:22.900 --> 13:27.700
Cotton Candy_We Rise

13:58.230 --> 13:59.130
Sir.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.740
TV networks are asking to cast Cotton Candy.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.840
There are three of them.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.710
Who should I toss this to?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.110
Jenna. Jenna. Tell Jenna.

14:06.740 --> 14:08.780
Wait! No, give it to me.

14:08.780 --> 14:10.710
Okay, good. Now go.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.780
Right.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.350
The song isn't important.

14:16.350 --> 14:18.350
Hopes and dreams are important.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.330
Stella!

14:25.330 --> 14:26.590
How have you been?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.900
- A commercial?
- Really?

14:31.570 --> 14:32.930
Chae-ah!

14:37.910 --> 14:39.040
Wait.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.370
Why is it

14:40.610 --> 14:41.840
so easy?

14:42.110 --> 14:44.110
Nothing happened when we were crying like crazy.

14:45.410 --> 14:46.280
I knew it!

14:46.280 --> 14:48.880
The best marketing is noise marketing!

14:48.880 --> 14:50.220
It's all thanks to CEO Cha.

14:50.220 --> 14:50.990
That's right.

14:50.990 --> 14:53.550
So let's ask him to give us a choreographer.

14:53.550 --> 14:54.620
If we shamelessly cling to him,

14:54.620 --> 14:56.620
I bet he'll pretend to lose and do it.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.010
How should we ask him?

15:02.630 --> 15:03.800
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

15:07.500 --> 15:10.540
Should I report to the agency about your state?

15:11.040 --> 15:14.540
The unit was your project, but it was also mine.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.380
Do you at least consider me in your anguish?

15:22.520 --> 15:24.050
In high school,

15:24.120 --> 15:25.950
when I first saw you when you transferred,

15:26.790 --> 15:28.890
I thought you had no charm at all.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.330
A harmless human with no artificial flavoring.

15:33.360 --> 15:34.530
That's boring.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.670
But I later realized, you weren't just harmless.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.140
You were a harmless wacko.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.170
You couldn't find a good place

15:43.170 --> 15:45.240
to dump your old sneakers

15:45.240 --> 15:47.540
and went around anxiously for a month.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.140
I thought you were a nut job then.

15:50.780 --> 15:51.910
You remember?

15:52.310 --> 15:54.420
The absurd funeral for the sneakers?

15:56.180 --> 15:57.890
That's the kind of sentiment I don't have.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.860
I don't understand, and it makes me jealous.

16:02.990 --> 16:04.590
You liked that song.

16:08.330 --> 16:10.700
You produced it with more affection than Bbiyong.

16:11.630 --> 16:12.830
You said it was your baby.

16:13.770 --> 16:16.800
You don't even chuck your worn shoes.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.870
Can you give up the song so easily?

16:31.150 --> 16:32.250
How can...

16:33.020 --> 16:35.260
The song be similar?

16:37.630 --> 16:38.910
What's going on?

16:38.960 --> 16:40.230
Are you crazy?

16:40.230 --> 16:41.560
Why do we have to give up on it?

16:41.560 --> 16:42.860
They should give it up!

16:42.860 --> 16:44.330
They only have content regulation review left

16:44.330 --> 16:45.560
after the music video mastering is finished.

16:45.530 --> 16:47.670
They already spent a lot of money?

16:47.670 --> 16:49.270
So we should comply?

16:49.340 --> 16:51.670
We can't pull our punches.

16:52.870 --> 16:54.640
What's wrong with you guys?

16:54.640 --> 16:57.350
Did you all suddenly become Buddhists?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.210
That's not what I meant.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.050
Why are you taking it out on me?

17:01.050 --> 17:03.220
Am I the agency? Am I Mars?

17:03.580 --> 17:05.250
If we don't change our song,

17:05.849 --> 17:07.460
it'll look like we plagiarized them.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.890
We can fight.

17:08.890 --> 17:11.359
We have proof that Jenna wrote that song

17:11.359 --> 17:12.490
a long time ago.

17:12.490 --> 17:13.790
Show them the proof!

17:13.790 --> 17:15.660
Tell them it's not plagiarism and fight!

17:15.660 --> 17:17.160
You think that will work?

17:17.160 --> 17:18.900
We're up against Mars.

17:18.900 --> 17:20.130
We won't be able to perform.

17:20.130 --> 17:21.940
Our career will end after we just fight.

17:21.940 --> 17:24.440
Seriously...

17:27.440 --> 17:28.440
Jenna.

17:29.780 --> 17:33.550
How meaningful is that song to Cotton Candy?

17:33.780 --> 17:35.680
There is nothing more meaningful

17:37.350 --> 17:39.320
than stopping a catastrophe.

17:48.030 --> 17:49.000
Let's change it.

17:50.530 --> 17:51.530
Jenna!

17:51.530 --> 17:52.870
You're right.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.260
Chae-ah is right.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.770
So are you, Stella.

17:58.670 --> 18:02.240
And the agency is right, too.

18:03.710 --> 18:04.880
But...

18:05.450 --> 18:07.380
There is nothing more meaningful

18:08.080 --> 18:09.820
than stopping a catastrophe.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.690
It's not like there's no way.

18:15.390 --> 18:17.830
We don't have to pierce through the rock.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.590
Time isn't on our side either.

18:19.590 --> 18:20.600
But this is...

18:20.600 --> 18:23.030
Our goal isn't to pierce through the rock.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.800
We'll get hurt when the fragments hit us.

18:28.300 --> 18:29.300
Jenna.

18:29.640 --> 18:31.570
I'm not against changing the song.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.880
I have a song we can use instead.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.110
But...

18:35.440 --> 18:36.940
Listen to what I have to say,

18:37.480 --> 18:40.720
and then decide if it's a rock we should pierce

18:41.050 --> 18:42.320
or a rock we should go around.

18:42.720 --> 18:46.050
I think Bbiyong stole your song.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.330
I have no proof.

18:51.690 --> 18:52.960
It's a hunch.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.060
But...

18:55.400 --> 18:56.630
I'm sure of it.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.700
What are you talking about?

18:58.870 --> 19:00.840
How can you be sure if you don't have proof?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.440
You said you first told Ji-han

19:03.570 --> 19:05.110
that this was your song, right?

19:05.670 --> 19:07.010
Why did you say that?

19:08.840 --> 19:10.110
I don't know.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.020
I just blurted it out automatically...

19:18.450 --> 19:20.290
Way back when we first met,

19:20.820 --> 19:22.590
we talked a lot about song writing.

19:22.690 --> 19:24.630
We talked about our favorite song writers.

19:25.430 --> 19:27.660
You also let me hear some of your songs.

19:29.030 --> 19:30.740
I thought you wouldn't

19:30.760 --> 19:32.760
be able to write hit songs.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.770
Building up the melody before the chorus...

19:37.040 --> 19:39.470
Splitting up the melody to make it rhythmical...

19:40.210 --> 19:42.410
Or letting the rhythm of the accompaniment loose,

19:42.410 --> 19:44.710
making it go down, then back up again...

19:45.750 --> 19:47.950
Most songs that sell are like that.

19:49.180 --> 19:51.290
But you weren't interested in that.

19:53.550 --> 19:55.320
At least in "Honest,"

19:55.460 --> 19:57.660
you put in elements of hit songs,

19:58.030 --> 19:59.590
so I thought you learned well.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.460
But in this song...

20:03.900 --> 20:06.430
I got the same vibe your old songs had.

20:07.570 --> 20:09.370
It's like your signature.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.540
Your sentiment.

20:12.510 --> 20:13.790
Hit song writers like me

20:13.820 --> 20:15.790
don't write songs like that.

20:15.810 --> 20:17.680
More so for Bbiyong.

20:18.110 --> 20:19.610
But in the unit's song...

20:21.020 --> 20:22.120
I saw it.

20:22.120 --> 20:23.420
Your signature.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.690
I can't understand it all.

20:26.690 --> 20:29.830
But you mean Bbiyong copied Jenna's song, right?

20:31.430 --> 20:32.430
But...

20:32.830 --> 20:34.100
Their song came out first.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.000
You sent the song to CEO Ma.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.000
What are the chances that Bbiyong listened to it?

20:39.570 --> 20:41.970
That disgusting little thief!

20:42.470 --> 20:43.440
Sit down.

21:18.970 --> 21:20.940
You should've pretended not to know.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.880
It would've been better not to know.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.250
Some things

21:27.350 --> 21:30.080
are better to not know.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.660
But you knew. You just pretended not to know.

21:37.390 --> 21:40.230
If you can keep pretending, then do it.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.330
Give it up.

21:42.730 --> 21:44.070
If it's comforting to feign ignorance,

21:44.070 --> 21:45.300
then do it.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.830
What do you want me to do?

21:49.740 --> 21:52.210
Drag everyone into a mud fight?

21:52.210 --> 21:54.510
Adding plagiarism dispute to a failed idol image?

21:54.740 --> 21:57.280
End everything in total chaos?

21:59.550 --> 22:00.880
It's just a song.

22:00.880 --> 22:02.950
Yeah, it's just a song.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.590
I can forget it and move on.

22:04.590 --> 22:05.590
Right.

22:06.150 --> 22:07.520
You have no proof.

22:07.820 --> 22:08.790
I don't.

22:08.790 --> 22:10.690
We won't win the plagiarism fight.

22:10.690 --> 22:11.760
No.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.230
What do you want me to do?

22:22.270 --> 22:23.340
Elle...

22:23.740 --> 22:24.740
Elle...

22:25.970 --> 22:27.070
Elle...

22:31.810 --> 22:33.110
Elle...

22:41.060 --> 22:42.120
You're here.

22:44.630 --> 22:45.490
Yeah.

24:38.640 --> 24:39.640
Okay.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.280
- It's great.
- Nice?

24:48.420 --> 24:49.750
It's better than last time.

24:49.750 --> 24:50.650
Right?

24:50.650 --> 24:53.690
Even I think yesterday's was too difficult.

24:53.690 --> 24:55.220
The choreographer said he won't change it,

24:55.220 --> 24:56.390
but I threw a tantrum.

24:56.390 --> 24:57.520
Jeez.

24:57.990 --> 24:58.760
What about Ji-han?

24:58.760 --> 24:59.690
He's at the vocal studio.

24:59.690 --> 25:00.390
Again?

25:00.390 --> 25:02.530
He's such a perfectionist.

25:02.530 --> 25:05.070
His pitch doesn't fall when he dances.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.770
But he's at it again.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.330
Great timing.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.310
Come in and sit.

25:46.540 --> 25:48.280
You're not listening

25:48.280 --> 25:49.940
so I guess you're here to announce something.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.910
Then before you throw a bomb,

25:52.910 --> 25:54.420
hear me out first.

25:57.580 --> 25:58.890
I'm listening.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.090
My aunt

26:03.920 --> 26:05.330
likes you.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.730
I do, too.

26:09.130 --> 26:10.830
My aunt thinks

26:10.930 --> 26:13.530
you make me be a better person.

26:14.470 --> 26:16.200
That's why she likes you.

26:18.640 --> 26:19.740
I do, too.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.440
At some point, you and Cotton Candy

26:23.440 --> 26:26.480
made me feel like I was a decent person.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.620
I'm not a person who can provide shade.

26:34.220 --> 26:37.320
Ask Ji-han. He knows it well.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.460
So...

26:41.760 --> 26:43.830
Don't expect any shade from me.

26:45.200 --> 26:48.570
But it wasn't so bad to feel like a decent person.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.510
As you said, I thought about a way.

26:52.210 --> 26:54.140
Cotton Candy and Starpeace.

26:56.040 --> 26:59.680
Let's renew our contract.

27:00.350 --> 27:03.550
The 2nd album will be released through Starpeace.

27:04.220 --> 27:06.520
Is this suitable to you?

27:09.390 --> 27:10.390
No.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.530
I don't want that.

27:13.690 --> 27:15.600
I'm not saying let's start a plagiarism fight.

27:16.060 --> 27:19.200
We won't renew our contract with Starpeace.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.040
I'm saying we should take courage.

27:22.270 --> 27:24.970
Becoming No.1 and then disbanding is our goal.

27:24.970 --> 27:25.610
Kim Jenna.

27:25.610 --> 27:27.290
We won't change our song.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.180
Kim Jenna.

27:28.180 --> 27:31.650
We'll release it at the same time as Mars' unit.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.050
But...

27:36.050 --> 27:39.620
If we don't change our song, what can we do?

27:41.690 --> 27:42.690
Okay.

27:43.760 --> 27:44.760
Let's do it.

27:45.660 --> 27:47.530
It's not like there's no way.

27:48.160 --> 27:50.460
Let's release our song on the same

27:50.760 --> 27:52.670
day and time of Mars' unit's song.

27:53.060 --> 27:53.980
What?

27:55.230 --> 27:56.180
But...

27:56.180 --> 27:57.210
The time...

27:57.230 --> 27:58.300
We lack time.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.010
But it's not impossible.

28:06.750 --> 28:07.850
We won't sleep.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.950
Like a crazy person going berserk...

28:09.950 --> 28:11.350
We'll prepare.

28:11.920 --> 28:13.350
It's an all-out-war.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.460
Right. Huh?

28:17.460 --> 28:18.430
Okay!

28:18.430 --> 28:21.100
Bring it on, Mars!

28:21.100 --> 28:24.430
Let's show them who the real crazy one is.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.970
Psychopath Cha will be so flustered.

28:28.470 --> 28:30.940
You're all crazy!

28:30.940 --> 28:32.670
What will I do without you?

28:32.670 --> 28:35.680
You said I can cross a river with a broken branch.

28:36.340 --> 28:38.480
I'm going to bet on that again.

28:38.610 --> 28:40.610
As long as you promise to play fair,

28:40.610 --> 28:43.650
you can still become a decent person.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.620
I don't understand.

28:46.920 --> 28:48.960
Why are you insisting on choosing that?

28:49.260 --> 28:52.490
In reality, David can't beat Goliath!

28:53.060 --> 28:55.860
A counterfeit can pretend to be real,

28:55.860 --> 28:58.670
but I won't be played like a fiddle.

28:59.130 --> 29:00.900
I'm going to let my voice be heard.

29:06.770 --> 29:08.040
Kim Jenna.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.710
Thanks for not grudgingly conceding to me.

29:12.110 --> 29:13.510
Of course, yesterday,

29:13.510 --> 29:15.220
I was a bit hurt,

29:15.350 --> 29:17.350
and I resented you a little.

29:17.950 --> 29:19.320
But I shouldn't have.

29:19.790 --> 29:21.490
Because we're both pros.

29:21.590 --> 29:23.820
Didn't the CEO say he'll renew your contract?

29:23.820 --> 29:25.130
I rejected that offer.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.430
Because it's not our path.

29:26.430 --> 29:28.000
Kim Jenna!

29:28.660 --> 29:31.800
Let's compete under the same conditions.

29:33.630 --> 29:34.910
Same conditions?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.900
How can it be the same?

29:38.040 --> 29:40.210
We're Mars and you're Cotton Candy.

29:40.210 --> 29:43.010
Well, I guess the number of fans is different.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.010
Are you refusing to shake my hand?

29:47.450 --> 29:48.960
Even if you are,

29:49.170 --> 29:50.990
we'll still be competing in good faith.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.730
I'll be going now.

29:56.620 --> 29:59.160
How could you not know my sincere intentions?

30:00.090 --> 30:03.600
Are you trying to make me give up?

30:03.600 --> 30:04.630
Seo Ji-han.

30:04.630 --> 30:08.440
I really wished for Cotton Candy's success.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.500
I wished for it more than anyone.

30:12.670 --> 30:14.410
Because I saw myself in Cotton Candy.

30:14.810 --> 30:16.980
You might not believe it, but it's true!

30:16.980 --> 30:19.980
I wanted to help you get back on your feet

30:23.820 --> 30:26.150
with the little power I had.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.460
Become No.1 and disband?

30:29.460 --> 30:31.060
I don't know about that.

30:31.790 --> 30:36.960
I just wanted you to sing on a proper stage.

30:38.230 --> 30:39.230
But...

30:41.460 --> 30:43.290
you want me to give up

30:44.520 --> 30:46.640
and let you have it all.

30:47.750 --> 30:48.810
That's not true.

30:48.810 --> 30:49.880
If it's not to give up,

30:49.880 --> 30:51.560
then are you planning to go to war?

30:52.250 --> 30:54.680
The same condition? Competition of good faith?

30:55.340 --> 30:57.020
You really think that?

30:57.730 --> 30:58.730
Calla...

31:07.900 --> 31:08.900
will...

31:09.930 --> 31:11.520
destroy Cotton Candy.

31:39.930 --> 31:41.460
Would you stop?

31:42.380 --> 31:45.390
I went backwards from Mars' unit release date.

31:45.910 --> 31:48.960
So Elle has to record tonight.

31:49.470 --> 31:50.700
Will that be okay?

31:51.640 --> 31:52.640
I'm ready.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.900
When did you prepare?

31:58.050 --> 31:59.340
Did you practice every day?

31:59.340 --> 32:00.090
Alone?

32:00.090 --> 32:01.670
In the non-sound-proofed study room?

32:01.690 --> 32:03.030
How?

32:03.030 --> 32:04.620
By just moving your mouth?

32:06.470 --> 32:07.470
Stop that.

32:08.170 --> 32:09.350
The choreography?

32:12.230 --> 32:13.660
I'm changing it to five people.

32:13.660 --> 32:14.910
I'm going to finish it until tomorrow.

32:14.910 --> 32:15.570
Good.

32:15.570 --> 32:18.340
The costumes must be done before the showcase.

32:18.440 --> 32:19.440
I know.

32:20.440 --> 32:22.610
Wardrobe asks for just a week.

32:22.670 --> 32:24.500
Let's thank Chae-ryeong.

32:24.680 --> 32:27.310
If it wasn't for her, we'd be in the markets now.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.520
Can we re-record?

32:32.600 --> 32:33.730
Record all together.

32:37.950 --> 32:39.310
We don't have time...

32:39.310 --> 32:40.230
Come on!

32:40.230 --> 32:42.870
We'll finish in one go. Let's do it together.

32:42.870 --> 32:44.040
Yeah!

32:44.100 --> 32:44.900
Shall we?

32:44.900 --> 32:46.100
Yes, of course.

32:46.160 --> 32:46.860
Okay.

32:46.860 --> 32:47.610
Good, right?

32:47.660 --> 32:48.890
Right, right, right?

33:11.440 --> 33:12.440
Hello?

33:13.090 --> 33:14.130
Sir.

33:14.750 --> 33:15.740
It's me.

33:16.110 --> 33:16.930
I know.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.400
Umm...

33:20.150 --> 33:21.270
I'm listening.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.300
Are you...

33:25.260 --> 33:26.790
free today?

33:36.420 --> 33:38.450
I set up that meeting for you.

33:38.740 --> 33:41.300
If you didn't want it, you should've told me.

33:41.530 --> 33:44.460
Did you consider the predicament you put me in?

33:45.630 --> 33:46.630
I'm sorry.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.330
Are you free tonight?

33:48.970 --> 33:50.940
There's an American record label called

33:50.940 --> 33:52.190
World American Music.

33:52.190 --> 33:53.750
The vice president went to college with me.

33:53.750 --> 33:54.940
He's in Korea right now.

33:55.980 --> 33:58.030
I'm having dinner with him. You should come.

33:58.530 --> 34:01.750
The West is interested in K-pop singers...

34:01.750 --> 34:02.750
Sir.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.889
Why are you being so hesitant?

34:12.250 --> 34:13.530
Feel free to speak.

34:15.550 --> 34:16.550
I...

34:18.630 --> 34:20.710
I've decided to go back to my team.

34:22.590 --> 34:23.820
You noticed me

34:24.830 --> 34:27.159
and tried to give me a good opportunity.

34:28.469 --> 34:30.150
I'm so grateful for that.

34:30.790 --> 34:32.719
I'm sorry I couldn't meet

34:33.460 --> 34:34.500
your expectations.

34:35.449 --> 34:38.290
I'm also very sorry to tell you this

34:39.840 --> 34:41.100
so suddenly.

34:44.889 --> 34:45.820
But I...

34:45.820 --> 34:46.820
Okay.

34:49.850 --> 34:51.530
Your hesitation made me wonder

34:51.550 --> 34:53.710
what important thing you had to say.

34:57.740 --> 34:58.740
Okay.

34:59.580 --> 35:00.580
Do that.

35:02.470 --> 35:04.210
I'll pay for the coffee.

35:07.930 --> 35:09.130
Oh, Kang Yu-ri.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.160
Did you think

35:12.820 --> 35:15.700
you were irreplaceable to me?

35:23.870 --> 35:24.990
That's absurd.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.600
I was a crazy idiot.

36:10.960 --> 36:11.960
Ready?

36:12.120 --> 36:13.120
Yeah.

36:13.150 --> 36:14.610
Can you really finish it in one go?

36:14.610 --> 36:16.450
Of course!

36:16.780 --> 36:17.970
It's ten bucks every time you make a mistake.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.030
- Okay!
- You bet!

36:19.030 --> 36:20.030
Here we go.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.360
- Got it.
- Okay.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.430
Three, two, one.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.230
A long wait

36:35.760 --> 36:37.470
Seems endless

36:37.810 --> 36:39.490
Tomorrow is coming again

36:40.900 --> 36:42.340
Light and darkness

36:43.960 --> 36:45.690
Repeats again today

36:46.040 --> 36:47.720
Night comes back

36:49.120 --> 36:50.800
Today again, you and I

36:51.030 --> 36:53.920
When there is no star to look upon

36:54.250 --> 36:55.180
Our hope

36:55.180 --> 36:57.170
We are together

36:57.170 --> 36:59.130
Remember, you and I

36:59.400 --> 37:02.120
When this moment passes

37:02.440 --> 37:03.460
We rise

37:03.460 --> 37:06.500
Hope this becomes a sweet memory

37:06.500 --> 37:08.340
The stars I see up above are shining

37:08.340 --> 37:09.540
Maybe we can touch that

37:09.540 --> 37:11.680
My time doesn't dry up

37:11.680 --> 37:13.460
Even if my body burns up

37:13.460 --> 37:15.030
With this enduring passion

37:15.030 --> 37:16.840
Even if the day is a thorny field

37:16.940 --> 37:19.000
I pray with the tears we shed

37:19.070 --> 37:20.710
Blood, sweat, tears, They don't lie

37:20.710 --> 37:21.920
Raise your head, Up high

37:21.920 --> 37:23.150
Coming up, It's on

37:25.970 --> 37:27.540
Move to the top fast, Fly up

37:30.040 --> 37:31.350
Going on and on

37:31.350 --> 37:34.080
In the end, I'll have my life, my way

37:34.210 --> 37:35.760
Move to the top fast, Fly up

37:35.760 --> 37:38.230
Breathe deep and watch that dream, Gotcha!

37:38.230 --> 37:39.830
In my dreams

37:39.430 --> 37:40.800
Let me sleep, you idiots

37:40.830 --> 37:43.120
It seems near

37:43.450 --> 37:45.200
That's all I feel

37:46.430 --> 37:47.970
Your words

37:49.030 --> 37:51.340
Make me look farther

37:51.340 --> 37:53.020
I heard we're disbanding.

37:53.380 --> 37:54.900
He's disbanding us.

37:55.450 --> 37:57.130
But he's keeping you.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.710
Being all torn to pieces,

38:00.960 --> 38:04.060
hating each other and bearing a grudge.

38:05.180 --> 38:07.720
I don't think we should end like this.

38:08.460 --> 38:10.540
We'll be No.1 in a music TV show,

38:11.570 --> 38:13.630
and then announce that we're disbanding.

38:14.670 --> 38:16.130
There's no time to hesitate

38:16.130 --> 38:17.640
so I don't have the luxury to stop you.

38:18.010 --> 38:21.010
Why are you trying to dictate my life? How dare you!

38:21.690 --> 38:23.370
But you know what, Elle?

38:23.480 --> 38:25.470
If you can't bear it,

38:26.730 --> 38:27.770
come back.

38:28.590 --> 38:29.590
It's okay.

38:45.490 --> 38:49.630
In a memory called a dream

38:50.610 --> 38:52.810
I'm free now

38:53.730 --> 39:00.380
A journey that only we can accomplish

39:00.380 --> 39:02.240
Today again, you and I

39:02.330 --> 39:05.320
Even when cold wind blows in our hearts

39:05.540 --> 39:06.540
Our hope

39:06.560 --> 39:08.510
We are together

39:08.510 --> 39:10.390
Remember, you and I

39:10.480 --> 39:13.570
When this moment passes

39:13.570 --> 39:14.790
Sunrise

39:14.790 --> 39:16.830
The light of the sun will fill us so high

39:16.830 --> 39:18.320
Coming up, It's on

39:20.740 --> 39:22.600
Move to the top fast, Fly up

39:24.930 --> 39:26.370
Going on and on

39:26.450 --> 39:28.920
In the end, I'll have my life, my way

39:28.970 --> 39:30.830
Move to the top fast, Fly up

39:42.910 --> 39:43.800
Huh?

39:44.660 --> 39:46.340
Everyone's still asleep?

39:51.820 --> 39:53.840
Get up! It's time to get up!

39:58.430 --> 40:00.230
Get out here quick! Get up!

40:06.720 --> 40:10.020
What's all the fuss this early in the morning?

40:10.020 --> 40:11.700
We went to bed so late.

40:11.950 --> 40:13.500
We slept too much.

40:14.330 --> 40:16.450
Let's go for a jog and then practice.

40:17.010 --> 40:19.010
We should eat something first.

40:24.730 --> 40:25.730
Huh?

40:26.690 --> 40:27.890
Is there a war?

40:30.600 --> 40:31.600
Jenna!

40:45.000 --> 40:46.070
Cotton Candy

40:46.580 --> 40:49.590
is swept up in plagiarism controversy

40:49.930 --> 40:52.010
regarding Mars' unit's new song "To You."

40:52.010 --> 40:54.920
Cotton Candy, who is to release a new song,

40:54.920 --> 40:57.110
is being accused of plagiarizing Mars' unit's

40:57.110 --> 40:58.930
new song that will be released soon.

40:59.370 --> 41:02.180
The main melody of the two songs is similar.

41:02.250 --> 41:04.140
If it's verified that Cotton Candy worked on

41:04.140 --> 41:07.760
their new song after Mars' song was completed,

41:08.200 --> 41:12.350
they'll be accused of plagiarism.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.800
Suspecting plagiarism between new songs

41:15.800 --> 41:17.540
that haven't been released

41:17.660 --> 41:19.340
is very unprecedented.

41:19.930 --> 41:21.970
It can imply problems within the agency...

41:24.910 --> 41:25.910
Mo Ga-jin!

41:26.420 --> 41:27.730
Get him on the line!

41:28.830 --> 41:29.830
Quickly!

41:34.510 --> 41:37.070
How can you do this? Huh?

41:37.170 --> 41:37.910
How?

41:37.910 --> 41:39.750
We didn't publish the article.

41:39.780 --> 41:41.060
Then who did it?

41:41.870 --> 41:43.670
You said you wanted to be a decent person.

41:43.690 --> 41:46.260
Seriously, we didn't publish the article.

41:47.190 --> 41:48.190
Sir!

41:48.270 --> 41:50.130
There are a lot of follow-up articles.

41:53.220 --> 41:56.060
To avoid being swept up in the plagiarism issue,

41:56.060 --> 41:57.560
Cotton Candy moved up their album release date

41:57.560 --> 42:00.060
to the day of Mars' unit's new song release date.

42:00.060 --> 42:02.590
This is 3 weeks earlier than their original schedule.

42:02.930 --> 42:04.870
Hey! Ji-han!

42:05.430 --> 42:07.090
Jenna. I'm telling you once more.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.470
We really didn't publish the article.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.110
Then who knows about it besides us?

42:12.110 --> 42:14.540
It's subtly spread in the agency.

42:15.170 --> 42:17.700
Reporter Mo wrote the exclusive first.

42:17.800 --> 42:20.500
But related key words were on social media at dawn

42:18.820 --> 42:20.610
Starpeace

42:20.510 --> 42:22.200
and rumors started to spread.

42:22.250 --> 42:24.180
Starpeace plagiarism?

42:22.290 --> 42:24.920
It first started with the post "Starpeace plagiarism?"

42:24.950 --> 42:25.810
Does Starpeace know about this situation?

42:25.110 --> 42:27.720
Questions came up on Mars' official social media.

42:25.810 --> 42:26.970
Cotton Candy's plagiarism issue is all over Twitter. Is it true?

42:26.970 --> 42:27.530
Did Cotton Candy really copy Mars' unit song?

42:27.730 --> 42:29.990
But it wasn't monitored because it was dawn.

42:27.790 --> 42:28.820
Director Yoon, answer me!

42:28.820 --> 42:30.030
Just tell us if they copied it or not.

42:30.030 --> 42:32.190
Then Reporter Mo got a tip.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.810
Who gave him the tip?

42:33.810 --> 42:34.850
It's Bbiyong!

42:35.070 --> 42:36.930
Hey! What are you talking about?

42:36.940 --> 42:39.110
Why would Bbiyong do such a suicidal thing?

42:39.130 --> 42:39.950
Jenna.

42:40.070 --> 42:41.560
You think this only damages you?

42:41.560 --> 42:42.760
Because Bbiyong

42:44.000 --> 42:45.400
stole my song!

42:45.400 --> 42:47.080
Jenna, that's enough!

42:49.710 --> 42:51.910
Reporters are calling like crazy.

42:52.150 --> 42:54.080
We have to make a statement quickly.

42:54.130 --> 42:55.330
Call a meeting.

42:56.990 --> 42:58.030
Call Bbiyong.

43:07.330 --> 43:08.520
Get lost, Nuisance Candy!

43:08.520 --> 43:09.910
I won't listen to a criminal's song.

43:09.910 --> 43:11.250
Comeback or not, apologize!

43:11.250 --> 43:13.710
Physiognomy is science. Look at Hyun-ji's eyes.

43:13.710 --> 43:14.710
They look so mean.

43:14.740 --> 43:17.230
If Mars' unit comeback is canceled or delayed,

43:17.230 --> 43:18.020
I'll kill them.

43:18.020 --> 43:19.690
If it's whistle blowing, it's game over.

43:19.690 --> 43:21.430
How audacious! Plagiarizing Mars' song!

43:21.430 --> 43:23.110
Turn off your phones.

43:26.290 --> 43:27.410
What do we do?

43:32.660 --> 43:33.660
Who's that?

43:37.250 --> 43:38.370
Anyone inside?

43:39.380 --> 43:40.660
Is anyone there?

43:41.970 --> 43:43.250
Is anyone there?

43:43.430 --> 43:45.110
Can we get an interview?

43:45.420 --> 43:46.420
Be still.

43:48.200 --> 43:49.600
You're inside, right?

43:49.600 --> 43:51.110
It'll only take a moment.

43:51.110 --> 43:52.790
Is the plagiarism true?

43:53.780 --> 43:54.840
What? That bastard!

43:54.840 --> 43:55.840
Stay still.

43:56.820 --> 43:57.820
Stella.

43:58.430 --> 43:59.930
She's on the roof.

44:02.390 --> 44:04.070
It'll only be a moment.

44:06.010 --> 44:07.890
A word, please?

44:09.510 --> 44:10.510
Excuse me!

44:13.570 --> 44:15.250
Why? Is someone there?

44:15.470 --> 44:16.980
I think so.

44:20.510 --> 44:22.050
Someone's there?

44:22.410 --> 44:23.980
I heard something.

44:35.570 --> 44:36.560
What's this door?

44:36.560 --> 44:37.560
Huh? Oh...

44:39.730 --> 44:41.410
Isn't it a storage room?

44:41.540 --> 44:42.900
I don't think so.

44:43.010 --> 44:44.130
What do we do?

44:44.910 --> 44:46.110
Is anyone home?

44:46.680 --> 44:48.490
I think this leads to the house.

44:48.790 --> 44:50.790
We can't open it without permission.

44:53.570 --> 44:54.710
Cotton Candy!

44:54.990 --> 44:55.980
Let's talk!

44:55.980 --> 44:57.390
Those jerks...

44:57.810 --> 44:58.850
Cotton Candy!

44:59.180 --> 45:00.220
Cotton Candy!

45:00.420 --> 45:02.510
Cotton Candy! Let's talk for a moment.

45:02.530 --> 45:03.890
Should I open it?

45:06.860 --> 45:07.860
Yeah.

45:08.020 --> 45:09.850
We don't know if it's the house or not.

45:17.970 --> 45:19.420
What are you doing?

45:20.260 --> 45:21.260
Troy?

45:23.910 --> 45:25.440
Oh, do you live here?

45:25.440 --> 45:26.980
I'm a reporter with TV Jeil Broadcasting Network.

45:27.020 --> 45:28.760
What are you doing? Leave now!

45:28.790 --> 45:29.530
Oh, we're...

45:29.550 --> 45:31.000
I said leave now!

45:31.050 --> 45:32.790
Are you...Troy?

45:33.010 --> 45:34.060
Oh! Is that so?

45:34.840 --> 45:36.160
I'm Reporter Jeong Su-Hong.

45:36.160 --> 45:38.250
Please clear up the plagiarism issue.

45:38.250 --> 45:39.310
Forget it. I said leave now!

45:39.310 --> 45:42.510
- Oh, well, we are...
- I told you to leave now!

45:42.670 --> 45:45.090
- It won't take long...
- I have nothing to say. Leave!

45:45.090 --> 45:47.710
- We're not trying to cause a problem.
- Leave now!

45:47.710 --> 45:48.710
Hey!

45:49.060 --> 45:51.540
Shut up! Shut up!

46:07.870 --> 46:08.870
Drink.

46:11.130 --> 46:12.480
What's going on?

46:12.740 --> 46:13.740
Who did it?

46:13.860 --> 46:15.540
CEO Cha? Director Yoon?

46:17.180 --> 46:18.050
I think it's Bbiyong.

46:18.050 --> 46:18.770
What?

46:18.960 --> 46:20.900
I'm going to kill him.

46:20.930 --> 46:21.600
Come on.

46:21.600 --> 46:24.140
There are Mars fans outside. Stay put.

46:30.090 --> 46:31.270
What about Jenna?

46:32.470 --> 46:33.470
No word?

46:33.560 --> 46:35.250
I'll say it's a false report.

46:35.450 --> 46:38.220
That it's groundless hearsay.

46:38.830 --> 46:41.170
So change your song and renew your contract.

46:42.040 --> 46:45.200
If it's known that you'll release your album with us,

46:45.600 --> 46:47.050
this issue will disappear.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.390
Because plagiarism in the same agency is absurd.

46:51.980 --> 46:54.610
Let's sort it out like that. Stop being stubborn.

46:54.620 --> 46:57.570
Don't sort it out. Tell the truth.

46:58.240 --> 47:00.850
Since it's come to this, reveal the truth.

47:01.040 --> 47:03.950
Bbiyong stole our song!

47:03.980 --> 47:06.030
How can I reveal something that's not there?

47:06.030 --> 47:07.630
Why don't you even try

47:07.940 --> 47:09.890
to believe what I say?

47:09.890 --> 47:11.220
Kim Jenna!

47:14.140 --> 47:16.480
If I start to believe what you say,

47:17.620 --> 47:19.030
we'll become enemies.

47:20.650 --> 47:22.360
Do you really want that to happen?

47:24.050 --> 47:25.170
Can't you see?

47:25.930 --> 47:27.300
Ji-han and I

47:27.440 --> 47:30.390
are both trying to protect you in our own way.

47:49.520 --> 47:51.480
Expel Cotton Candy

47:51.480 --> 47:53.150
and protect Mars!

47:53.150 --> 47:55.140
Expel Cotton Candy

47:55.140 --> 47:56.650
and protect Mars!

47:56.870 --> 47:59.100
Director Yoon must apologize!

47:59.160 --> 48:01.310
Director Yoon must apologize!

48:04.950 --> 48:05.950
Sir.

48:06.640 --> 48:09.330
They won't leave without an interview. What now?

48:09.330 --> 48:10.580
What do you mean, "what now?"

48:10.580 --> 48:11.690
What should I do? Huh?

48:11.690 --> 48:12.760
What about me?

48:12.760 --> 48:14.200
You go and do the interview.

48:14.200 --> 48:15.220
Are you crazy?

48:15.220 --> 48:16.340
Why would I tip him off?

48:16.340 --> 48:18.570
Do you know how much I'm being harassed?

48:18.570 --> 48:20.840
Who said that I tipped him off?

48:21.990 --> 48:22.990
Was it you?

48:23.660 --> 48:25.000
You little...

48:36.660 --> 48:37.660
Hey.

48:39.450 --> 48:41.930
You've been spouting nonsense.

48:42.740 --> 48:44.910
I'm letting it slide because of the agency and Mars.

48:44.910 --> 48:47.710
If I wasn't an executive, I wouldn't care.

48:48.500 --> 48:49.850
I would've made you pay for this.

48:49.850 --> 48:52.750
Did CEO Ma make you listen to my song or not?

49:01.100 --> 49:03.560
Do you really want to know the truth?

49:03.840 --> 49:05.520
This is what CEO Ma said.

49:05.660 --> 49:07.360
He said you sent him a song,

49:07.360 --> 49:09.520
but he's not sure if he should listen to it.

49:09.580 --> 49:11.420
He was going to cut you off anyway.

49:11.420 --> 49:13.210
He was worried you'd get the wrong signal.

49:13.210 --> 49:15.110
Then you'll act like you're victims

49:15.110 --> 49:16.900
and cling on in tears.

49:17.930 --> 49:19.770
Then what will your lives be like?

49:20.770 --> 49:22.970
If you were to get married,

49:23.100 --> 49:25.190
you'd have to meet a decent man.

49:25.220 --> 49:26.860
But all five of you just rot inside

49:26.880 --> 49:28.710
that dark, stinky place. He said you should stop.

49:28.730 --> 49:30.000
- Hey!
- Bbiyong!

49:30.000 --> 49:31.680
If you didn't start this,

49:32.680 --> 49:34.310
I would've taken it to my grave.

49:35.950 --> 49:38.160
So I told him, if he wasn't going to do it,

49:38.400 --> 49:40.130
then just throw it away without listening.

49:40.430 --> 49:43.870
He has to be cold and cut you off.

49:44.900 --> 49:46.970
That would be better for the both of you.

49:47.370 --> 49:48.370
That's all.

49:50.100 --> 49:53.240
I don't know if he listened later on. Don't care.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.220
Stop lying!

49:55.240 --> 49:56.520
You bi*$h!

49:57.770 --> 49:59.450
You're stressing me out!

49:59.680 --> 50:02.150
Why do I have to explain myself to her?

50:02.380 --> 50:04.060
How dare you make me!

50:04.320 --> 50:05.390
I'm Bbiyong!

50:05.390 --> 50:06.830
I'm No.1 in Korea!

50:08.610 --> 50:10.710
Why'd I steal from a failed tramp like her?

50:10.710 --> 50:11.910
Executive Bong!

50:15.550 --> 50:18.380
Don't ever call me for this again.

50:18.400 --> 50:19.210
Got that?

50:20.680 --> 50:22.360
If you call me again,

50:22.580 --> 50:24.980
you better get a lawyer. Got that?

50:27.350 --> 50:28.890
But I'm curious.

50:36.790 --> 50:38.690
When you heard Cotton Candy's song,

50:39.260 --> 50:41.200
you must've known they were similar.

50:42.780 --> 50:44.720
Why didn't you say anything?

50:46.100 --> 50:48.100
Our song was finished by then.

50:57.520 --> 50:59.250
Why didn't I say anything?

51:00.760 --> 51:02.170
At that time, I had

51:02.320 --> 51:04.450
a small amount of pity for them.

51:05.350 --> 51:07.010
Don't you remember their situation at that time?

51:07.200 --> 51:09.170
All they had was their song.

51:09.530 --> 51:11.310
If I told them it was similar to our unit's song,

51:11.420 --> 51:13.750
that even their song wasn't theirs,

51:13.960 --> 51:15.640
how would they have felt?

51:16.310 --> 51:19.400
That's why I tried to make you give up.

51:19.490 --> 51:20.450
Remember?

51:20.490 --> 51:23.290
If you gave up on that and asked for help,

51:23.630 --> 51:25.030
I would've helped you.

51:25.030 --> 51:26.030
But

51:27.390 --> 51:28.680
what did you do to me?

51:28.680 --> 51:31.040
You don't need my premium?

51:32.360 --> 51:34.770
Then you're on your own. Live or die.

51:34.830 --> 51:36.820
But it doesn't make sense you'd neglect it!

51:36.820 --> 51:38.080
Knowing things will get out of hand?

51:38.080 --> 51:39.280
Son of a bi*$h!

51:40.190 --> 51:41.470
Did I make it go out of hand?

51:41.470 --> 51:43.760
Who's fault is it that we've come so far?

51:48.830 --> 51:49.980
Collab?

51:52.460 --> 51:54.140
There were many chances

51:54.730 --> 51:55.930
to cut them off.

51:57.400 --> 51:58.600
Think carefully

51:59.640 --> 52:01.370
about who really did this.

52:10.770 --> 52:11.770
Kim Jenna.

52:13.710 --> 52:15.020
You saw that, right?

52:16.530 --> 52:17.970
Let's sort this out.

52:18.140 --> 52:19.260
For all of us.

52:38.030 --> 52:39.710
They're Calla, right?

52:42.290 --> 52:44.090
I think there are more now.

52:45.050 --> 52:47.180
Tell Jenna not to come.

52:47.600 --> 52:48.990
We'll text her when they leave.

52:57.380 --> 52:59.580
Can you accept what Bbiyong said?

53:02.220 --> 53:03.580
I'm trying to.

53:04.510 --> 53:06.380
My brain can do that, you know.

53:08.090 --> 53:09.740
Didn't you hear what CEO Cha said?

53:10.300 --> 53:11.740
He'll sort it out.

53:27.530 --> 53:28.400
Hello?

53:28.520 --> 53:29.720
Jenna, where are you?

53:29.720 --> 53:30.950
I'm in front of my house.

53:30.950 --> 53:32.630
I heard Calla is there.

53:34.150 --> 53:35.030
Yes.

53:35.030 --> 53:36.140
There's less now.

53:37.130 --> 53:38.870
I have to be with my team.

53:40.850 --> 53:41.850
Bye.

53:56.900 --> 53:58.620
Huh? It's Kim Jenna.

53:59.420 --> 54:01.810
Kim Jenna! Kim Jenna!

54:01.810 --> 54:03.220
Let's talk!

54:03.250 --> 54:04.400
I said let's talk!

54:04.400 --> 54:05.210
I'm sorry.

54:05.210 --> 54:06.620
Did you really copy our Mars' song?

54:06.620 --> 54:06.960
I'm sorry.

54:06.960 --> 54:08.540
Hey! You shameful witches!

54:08.590 --> 54:10.460
- Seriously...
- Let go!

54:12.310 --> 54:13.310
Hey!

54:18.470 --> 54:19.470
Who's he?

54:20.770 --> 54:21.810
Seok-choon...

54:22.450 --> 54:23.840
What are you doing?

54:23.840 --> 54:25.110
Leave! Leave now!

54:25.110 --> 54:27.250
- Let's go.
- Who are you?

54:27.310 --> 54:29.170
- Stop.
- Just go.

54:29.170 --> 54:30.890
- Come out here!
- Who do you think you are?

54:30.890 --> 54:32.410
I said leave!

54:34.030 --> 54:35.870
I was leaving after requesting semester deferment.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.190
Then I saw the internet go crazy.

54:38.910 --> 54:39.910
Also,

54:40.520 --> 54:42.390
I came because of what Du-ho said.

54:42.820 --> 54:45.200
What did he tell you?

54:45.420 --> 54:48.370
It was when you went to the countryside event.

54:49.170 --> 54:51.440
He told me to look after you guys.

54:53.820 --> 54:55.460
So don't worry!

54:55.460 --> 54:56.950
I'll take care of you.

54:57.040 --> 54:58.020
Because

54:58.020 --> 55:00.450
Du-ho taught me a lot.

55:02.550 --> 55:03.490
Du-ho...

55:05.330 --> 55:07.290
Why are you crying again?

55:11.670 --> 55:12.670
Jenna.

55:13.610 --> 55:15.290
What did the agency say?

55:39.320 --> 55:41.440
There are times when the dark is good.

55:41.440 --> 55:42.880
Everything is cloaked.

55:43.260 --> 55:44.700
It's become quiet.

55:46.660 --> 55:49.180
But the online world continues on.

55:51.210 --> 55:52.890
It's turning into hell.

55:56.220 --> 55:57.580
What will you do?

56:02.580 --> 56:04.260
A right-minded person

56:04.860 --> 56:07.230
would accept the CEO's offer, right?

56:09.960 --> 56:10.960
Right.

56:11.510 --> 56:14.220
It'd also be a great celebration of your return.

56:15.320 --> 56:16.680
You're not wrong.

56:18.890 --> 56:19.890
But...

56:22.290 --> 56:23.490
I'm ready to fight.

56:30.670 --> 56:32.210
Don't you think

56:33.590 --> 56:35.520
the world is taking us as a fool?

56:36.060 --> 56:38.250
That's why trash keeps clinging to us.

56:39.520 --> 56:41.890
We're not dragging people in a mud fight.

56:42.660 --> 56:44.730
Where we are is all mud.

56:45.780 --> 56:47.760
So we have to fight to get out.

56:49.470 --> 56:51.040
Let's go with our plan.

56:59.170 --> 57:01.030
Thanks to this fiasco,

57:02.300 --> 57:04.710
people know we're releasing a new song.

57:07.100 --> 57:08.740
They'll listen to it at least once.

57:08.960 --> 57:11.860
Those with good ears will know what's false.

57:11.930 --> 57:15.130
Those who can't tell, we'll fight them.

57:19.960 --> 57:23.580
Maybe we should change our name to Amazones.

57:25.910 --> 57:27.120
That wasn't funny?

57:29.510 --> 57:30.470
Unbelievable.

57:32.130 --> 57:33.610
I knew you'd like this song.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.800
I'll describe how you feel.

57:36.400 --> 57:39.470
I can smell an unfamiliar fragrance from my man.

57:39.670 --> 57:43.430
It's unfamiliar, but not out of place.

57:43.490 --> 57:45.170
Did he hear what we said about him before?

57:45.170 --> 57:47.210
It's hard to let go of your own style.

57:47.210 --> 57:49.550
He's truly a top class songwriter.

57:53.960 --> 57:56.860
Don't sort it out. Tell the truth.

57:57.810 --> 58:00.310
Since it's come to this, reveal the truth.

58:01.220 --> 58:04.110
Bbiyong stole our song!

58:04.110 --> 58:06.220
How can I reveal something that's not there?

58:06.220 --> 58:07.820
Why don't you even try

58:08.180 --> 58:10.020
to believe what I say?

58:10.040 --> 58:11.040
Kim Jenna!

58:11.090 --> 58:13.990
Did CEO Ma make you listen to my song or not?

58:49.770 --> 58:51.760
You were looking for me again?

58:52.030 --> 58:53.330
That song.

58:53.960 --> 58:56.690
Did CEO Ma not send it to you?

58:57.570 --> 58:58.570
The song?

59:00.210 --> 59:01.290
What song?

59:01.290 --> 59:02.310
Cotton Candy's song.

59:02.310 --> 59:03.300
Come here.

59:07.140 --> 59:08.140
Come here.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.320
Closer?

59:11.290 --> 59:13.310
Cotton Candy's song?

59:13.910 --> 59:15.590
I don't think he sent it.

59:15.810 --> 59:16.730
Did he send it to me?

59:16.730 --> 59:17.980
I think he did.

59:19.040 --> 59:20.720
You said it last time.

59:21.180 --> 59:22.540
They have a song.

59:24.190 --> 59:25.420
What do you mean?

59:27.930 --> 59:30.460
Kim Jenna has a new song.

59:37.350 --> 59:39.450
Oh, you mean...?

59:39.930 --> 59:40.930
It seems to me

59:41.590 --> 59:43.740
you already knew

59:44.400 --> 59:46.490
about their new song.

59:51.380 --> 59:52.380
Oh!

59:53.240 --> 59:54.240
Oh!

59:54.510 --> 59:56.840
You're right. He sent the song to me.

59:56.840 --> 59:57.830
He sent it.

59:57.830 --> 1:00:00.080
Perhaps so I'd listen to it.

1:00:02.010 --> 1:00:02.980
But I didn't.

1:00:02.980 --> 1:00:04.660
I don't care about that.

1:00:07.230 --> 1:00:08.230
From here on out,

1:00:09.090 --> 1:00:10.770
be completely honest.

1:00:14.380 --> 1:00:17.760
You know I'm always honest...

1:00:18.190 --> 1:00:20.330
My family motto is

1:00:20.470 --> 1:00:22.440
"Be honest, be frank."

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:23.960
What I want to know

1:00:24.740 --> 1:00:25.740
is

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:28.430
how you received the song.

1:00:31.090 --> 1:00:33.360
Oh, well, was it in a UBS or a CD?

1:00:33.950 --> 1:00:35.280
Well, that...

1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:36.280
Email?

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:53.740
I don't think that's it.

1:00:53.830 --> 1:00:55.980
People usually send it via email.

1:00:56.150 --> 1:00:57.380
Really?

1:00:58.140 --> 1:01:00.580
Let's take a look at your email account.

1:01:00.910 --> 1:01:01.490
What?

1:01:01.490 --> 1:01:02.620
Why are you here?

1:01:04.280 --> 1:01:05.620
Did you really not copy it?

1:01:08.490 --> 1:01:08.850
What?

1:01:08.850 --> 1:01:09.850
Be honest.

1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:13.010
Did you really not know about it?

1:01:13.010 --> 1:01:15.380
You keep talking trash.

1:01:20.400 --> 1:01:21.770
It's good you're here.

1:01:21.930 --> 1:01:22.930
Hey.

1:01:24.040 --> 1:01:25.250
Why did you do that to me earlier?

1:01:25.250 --> 1:01:26.760
How can you speak like that to me?

1:01:26.760 --> 1:01:27.330
Bbiyong!

1:01:27.330 --> 1:01:29.650
How many bowls of rice did we share?

1:01:29.650 --> 1:01:32.300
How long have we been eating from the same bowl?

1:01:32.950 --> 1:01:34.840
How can you be on that tramp's side?

1:01:35.510 --> 1:01:37.120
How many years have you sung my songs?

1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:39.010
That's not what I'm talking about!

1:01:41.510 --> 1:01:42.510
Hey.

1:01:43.050 --> 1:01:44.240
What is she to you?

1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:45.480
It's not your song!

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:46.600
It is my song!

1:01:47.060 --> 1:01:49.660
Why are you trying to look at my email?

1:01:50.110 --> 1:01:51.970
This is invading my privacy.

1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:53.960
This is my private life.

1:01:54.390 --> 1:01:56.490
So I don't have to follow your orders.

1:01:56.490 --> 1:01:58.500
It's not an order, it's a request.

1:02:00.440 --> 1:02:01.860
Sounds like an order to me.

1:02:02.990 --> 1:02:04.110
Like you said,

1:02:04.450 --> 1:02:06.330
how many years have I sung your songs?

1:02:07.060 --> 1:02:09.390
If you add the solo, it's over 30 songs.

1:02:10.030 --> 1:02:11.550
But not one of them

1:02:14.180 --> 1:02:16.250
broke out of what I expected.

1:02:18.110 --> 1:02:19.120
What? You bastard!

1:02:19.130 --> 1:02:20.570
But not this song.

1:02:21.220 --> 1:02:22.650
You weren't in the song!

1:02:22.650 --> 1:02:24.170
Stop talking trash!

1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:26.440
Hey.

1:02:26.790 --> 1:02:28.050
What do you know?

1:02:28.050 --> 1:02:29.310
Are you a fortune teller?

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:30.510
I'll quit my job here.

1:02:30.510 --> 1:02:31.510
Okay.

1:02:34.190 --> 1:02:35.630
You're so... So...

1:02:36.630 --> 1:02:37.830
You're so mean!

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:42.430
It's not in the email...

1:02:44.410 --> 1:02:45.860
Was this the password?

1:02:46.780 --> 1:02:47.780
Nope.

1:02:50.590 --> 1:02:51.590
Take a look.

1:02:51.910 --> 1:02:54.200
Let's find CEO Ma's email.

1:02:54.620 --> 1:02:56.750
I'm searching, but it's not here.

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:00.250
CEO Ma Jin-woo
Jenna's song

1:03:09.020 --> 1:03:10.380
Shall we open it?

1:03:16.730 --> 1:03:17.730
Now.

1:03:21.250 --> 1:03:22.810
You leaked to the press, right?

1:03:22.810 --> 1:03:25.130
You think everything will go your way?

1:03:26.200 --> 1:03:29.340
You think there won't be anyone thinking like me?

1:03:33.100 --> 1:03:35.760
I'm going to ask CEO Cha to investigate.

1:03:38.780 --> 1:03:40.410
You think I'll go down by myself?

1:03:44.310 --> 1:03:45.590
I'll take you with me.

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:48.460
Title: Jenna's song / Sent by: CEO Ma Jin-woo /
Sent to: Executive Bong Chung Bong / CC: Starpeace Yoon Se-yeol

1:03:50.050 --> 1:03:52.960
You're the joint producer.

1:03:53.430 --> 1:03:55.690
People won't believe that you didn't know.

1:03:58.620 --> 1:03:59.880
You bragged everywhere

1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:01.830
that you're producing the unit album.

1:04:03.140 --> 1:04:06.080
A scratch on my face is just an injury.

1:04:08.310 --> 1:04:11.110
But a scratch on this artwork...

1:04:11.730 --> 1:04:14.790
You think you'll die or not?

IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:05:04.140 --> 1:05:05.940
Are you separate from Mars?

1:05:05.970 --> 1:05:08.000
How dare you disgrace them?

1:05:08.080 --> 1:05:09.040
It's mom.

1:05:08.340 --> 1:05:08.920
It's Mom.

1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:10.620
They're here. They're back!

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:12.180
- You know that's Lea Kim?
- What?

1:05:13.490 --> 1:05:15.430
She wants to do the choreography for Cotton Candy.

1:05:15.430 --> 1:05:18.330
Cotton Candy is going around saying nonsense.

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:19.110
What about Ji-han?

1:05:19.110 --> 1:05:20.010
Did you meet Ji-han?

1:05:20.060 --> 1:05:22.130
You protect what's important to you.

1:05:22.170 --> 1:05:23.470
Now, we'll be enemies.

1:05:23.470 --> 1:05:24.500
It's all mine.

1:05:24.510 --> 1:05:25.430
Good luck.

1:05:25.470 --> 1:05:28.200
Before Cotton Candy requested an arrangement,

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:29.940
our song was already finished.

1:05:29.940 --> 1:05:30.940
I swear

1:05:31.040 --> 1:05:32.040
"We Rise"

1:05:32.590 --> 1:05:34.270
is Cotton Candy's song.
