WEBVTT

00:00.537 --> 00:02.871
<i>Previously on Masters of Sex...</i>

00:02.906 --> 00:04.473
I wanted to give you this.

00:04.507 --> 00:05.841
And I came up with the amount

00:05.875 --> 00:09.244
by, uh, adding up the times
we've... participated.

00:10.713 --> 00:12.681
You son of a bitch.

00:12.715 --> 00:14.116
I have cancer.

00:14.150 --> 00:15.851
I'm not going to be around

00:15.885 --> 00:17.452
to see the testing
become routine.

00:17.487 --> 00:20.455
I'm going to have
to hand the work off

00:20.490 --> 00:22.858
to someone
who can fight the fight.

00:22.892 --> 00:25.360
I know
there have been other women.

00:25.395 --> 00:27.296
No.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.830
He's queer.

00:28.865 --> 00:30.632
You can't give your husband
what he likes.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.534
Your husband likes boys.

00:32.569 --> 00:36.305
I've got to grab their
attention in the first two minutes...

00:36.339 --> 00:38.507
and then hold it for another 38.

00:38.541 --> 00:41.043
Once you present
the work, what'll be different?

00:41.077 --> 00:46.114
A university's stamp of
approval makes the work... legitimate.

00:46.149 --> 00:49.051
When do you stop feeling
like you've got something to prove?

00:49.085 --> 00:50.852
There's always
something to prove.

00:50.887 --> 00:52.521
Why don't you let me
worry about everything?

00:52.555 --> 00:54.122
I want us to be a team.

00:54.157 --> 00:57.125
Aren't we?
We're a couple.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.561
No, a team.
Like Burns and Allen.

00:59.596 --> 01:01.563
Haas and Johnson.

01:01.598 --> 01:03.365
It's got a ring to it.

01:54.650 --> 01:56.484
Well, I think you have to say

01:56.519 --> 01:58.220
you're entertaining
multiple offers.

01:58.254 --> 02:00.021
Isn't that the point
of going to LA?

02:00.056 --> 02:02.324
Are you going to Disneyland?

02:02.358 --> 02:04.659
Close to Disneyland, I think.

02:04.694 --> 02:07.495
It's in Anaheim, which--
Well, you know what?

02:07.530 --> 02:08.864
I'm not really sure
where anything is out there.

02:08.898 --> 02:10.866
Don't act like
you know Disneyland, Tessa.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.034
I do know.
Pinocchio lives there.

02:13.069 --> 02:14.803
And fairies
fly through the air.

02:14.837 --> 02:16.471
A UCLA offer
could certainly help

02:16.505 --> 02:19.140
with, say, Passavant Memorial
in Chicago...

02:19.175 --> 02:21.643
Mercy Hospital
in Oklahoma City.

02:21.677 --> 02:23.545
So, why do they
call it a right angle

02:23.579 --> 02:27.315
instead of a left angle?

02:27.350 --> 02:28.884
It's a Latin term--

02:28.918 --> 02:31.486
- angulus rectus.
- Got it.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.788
Literally angle upright...

02:33.823 --> 02:35.190
All right.

02:35.224 --> 02:38.293
...meaning the line
that sticks up from the base.

02:38.327 --> 02:40.528
Are you the smartest
person in the world?

02:40.563 --> 02:43.565
Second-smartest.
Your mom got first prize.

02:43.599 --> 02:46.134
And since I won't be
seeing you kids for a few days,

02:46.168 --> 02:48.169
how about I tuck you in tonight?

02:48.204 --> 02:49.938
- Yay!
- Yay!

02:49.972 --> 02:51.539
Then who tucks <i>you</i> in?

02:51.574 --> 02:52.574
Oh.

03:40.489 --> 03:42.657
It's a big day.

04:00.876 --> 04:02.243
Dishes in the sink, Tessie.

04:04.146 --> 04:06.314
And grab your red coat
from under the bed.

04:09.251 --> 04:11.586
We need to hide
the red coat better.

04:11.620 --> 04:14.322
<i>...air force base</i>
<i>in New Mexico...</i>

04:14.357 --> 04:16.391
Henry, I really don't want

04:16.425 --> 04:18.625
to have to run for the bus
this morning.

04:18.661 --> 04:20.894
Mom, look.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.797
<i>...three years in the making,</i>

04:22.832 --> 04:26.368
<i>many starts and stops,</i>
<i>but today Project Manhigh</i>

04:26.402 --> 04:27.902
<i>finally takes to the skies.</i>

04:27.937 --> 04:30.138
<i>Major David Simons</i>
<i>has seated himself</i>

04:30.172 --> 04:33.208
<i>inside an aluminum capsule</i>
<i>and is ascending to a height</i>

04:33.242 --> 04:35.477

04:35.511 --> 04:37.746
<i>We now go to the</i>
<i>Project Manhigh's Commander,</i>

04:37.780 --> 04:40.015
<i>who is speaking directly</i>
<i>with Major Simons...</i>

04:40.049 --> 04:42.584
He's going into space
for real, mom.

04:42.618 --> 04:44.152
<i>Major Simons, you are about</i>

04:44.186 --> 04:45.920
<i>to reach the high point</i>
<i>of your career.</i>

04:45.955 --> 04:48.623
<i>It's quite a day, Colonel.</i>

04:48.657 --> 04:49.958
<i>Quite a day.</i>

04:50.926 --> 04:53.094
Every seat is accounted for.

04:53.129 --> 04:55.497
We'll have at least
two dozen standing.

04:55.531 --> 04:57.799
My worry now
is the gin and vermouth.

04:57.833 --> 05:01.169
My hands will be arthritic
claws by the time I'm finished.

05:03.039 --> 05:04.305
"All male subjects

05:04.340 --> 05:08.376
expressed concern
about a possible link

05:08.411 --> 05:12.414
between excessive masturbation
and mental illness."

05:13.783 --> 05:14.816
Ah. Coming.

05:14.850 --> 05:17.552
I'm coming.

05:17.586 --> 05:19.087
So... "Excessive"?

05:19.121 --> 05:21.656
What is that, statistically?
Several times a day?

05:21.690 --> 05:23.758
I mean, obviously that would be
overdoing it, but...

05:23.793 --> 05:24.759
once a day...

05:24.794 --> 05:26.461
Lester, you're fine.

05:27.830 --> 05:31.466
Dr. Masters, do you want
70 or 80 bound copies

05:31.500 --> 05:33.835
of the study available
to the attendees?

05:33.869 --> 05:37.038
An even 100, to be
distributed <i>after</i> the presentation.

05:37.073 --> 05:39.074
But how do you know I'm fine?

05:39.108 --> 05:40.642
Because I'm a doctor.

05:40.676 --> 05:43.111
I can spot a statistically
average masturbator

05:43.145 --> 05:44.112
from a mile away.

05:44.146 --> 05:47.215
Oh. Good.

05:47.249 --> 05:48.683
I-I'll fix the feedback.

05:49.752 --> 05:53.888
Bill, are you sure
about the Martinis?

05:53.923 --> 05:56.825
'Cause I could whip up
a delicious Planter's Punch.

05:56.859 --> 05:59.094
Punch is for bingo games.

05:59.128 --> 06:00.795
The atmosphere here

06:00.830 --> 06:03.331
needs to reflect
the significance of the study.

06:03.365 --> 06:05.100
Well, then,
maybe no alcohol at all.

06:06.402 --> 06:11.106
Well, the study deserves
a-- an open and receptive audience.

06:11.140 --> 06:13.208
I think it can only help
if everyone's a little looped.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.076
It's about setting the stage.

06:15.111 --> 06:17.178
Martinis set the proper tone.

06:17.213 --> 06:18.413
It's your day.

06:18.447 --> 06:19.647
Although, given
it's a sold-out crowd,

06:19.682 --> 06:22.784
we will need another
four dozen canapes.

06:25.988 --> 06:30.091
"And all males
defined 'excessive masturbation'

06:30.126 --> 06:33.294
to be a frequency more than
they, in fact, indulged,

06:33.329 --> 06:38.600
it would seem, as a means of
justifying their current habit."

06:48.210 --> 06:50.011
Last time you came in
with a headline,

06:50.045 --> 06:51.679
the Japs had bombed
Pearl Harbor.

06:53.349 --> 06:56.618
Charles Albert
Rutledge got a life sentence.

06:56.652 --> 06:59.120
- Who?
- State Vs. Rutledge,

06:59.155 --> 07:01.289
an office clerk from Vernon.

07:01.323 --> 07:03.791
The Missouri Supreme Court

07:03.826 --> 07:06.394
unanimously handed down
a sentence of life imprisonment

07:06.428 --> 07:08.463
for his...

07:08.497 --> 07:10.999
"Detestable
and abominable perversions

07:11.033 --> 07:13.168
with a male teenager."

07:15.638 --> 07:18.873
Normally, I would never notice
this story, but today

07:18.908 --> 07:23.811
I thought, "My God.
That could be my husband."

07:28.784 --> 07:30.552
The boy in the hotel
that night...

07:30.586 --> 07:32.187
Margaret,
I'm not gonna talk about this.

07:32.221 --> 07:33.521
You have to, Barton.

07:33.556 --> 07:36.991
Because if you had just
discovered, after 30 years,

07:37.026 --> 07:38.760
that I was a Martian...

07:38.794 --> 07:42.630
the least I could do
is explain to you life on Mars.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.101
You slept with that boy
that night.

07:48.737 --> 07:50.505
Not that night.

07:50.539 --> 07:53.374
But he was your...

07:53.409 --> 07:57.145
your lover?

07:57.179 --> 08:00.348
I paid him.

08:00.382 --> 08:02.984
Did you have feelings for him?

08:13.429 --> 08:17.398
Margaret...

08:17.433 --> 08:21.970
I am so ashamed...

08:22.004 --> 08:25.373
that all this time,
I could never stop.

08:25.407 --> 08:27.909
How many have there been?

08:33.515 --> 08:35.817
Oh.

08:35.851 --> 08:36.918
I see.

08:36.952 --> 08:39.020
And...

08:39.054 --> 08:42.724
have they always been for hire,
these men?

08:42.758 --> 08:44.759
Not all. Some.

08:44.793 --> 08:49.297
But none of them ever changed
how I felt about you.

08:49.331 --> 08:51.566
Really.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.569
You never loved one of them?

09:01.510 --> 09:04.312
James Davenport.

09:04.346 --> 09:06.214
He was the only one that...

09:09.918 --> 09:12.287
That was so very long ago.

09:14.223 --> 09:17.358
The summer
before I went to college.

09:17.393 --> 09:19.294
You loved a boy
when you were 18?

09:19.328 --> 09:21.262
You knew you felt this way
when you were 18?

09:21.297 --> 09:22.897
It wasn't so clear-cut then.

09:22.931 --> 09:24.699
But you hadn't even met me yet

09:24.733 --> 09:28.870
and you already knew
you could never want me.

09:28.904 --> 09:30.805
I'm gonna make it up to you.

09:30.839 --> 09:33.341
By waving a magic wand?

09:33.375 --> 09:36.377
I was 10 when you were 18.

09:36.412 --> 09:38.680
Everything was ahead.

09:38.714 --> 09:41.149
You cannot
give me back the years.

09:41.183 --> 09:43.217
I could've done something else.

09:43.252 --> 09:45.653
I could've
been with someone else.

09:45.688 --> 09:47.422
Why wasn't that my choice,

09:47.456 --> 09:51.025
whether I wanted to spend
my life with-- with a queer?

09:51.060 --> 09:52.060
Margaret...

09:52.094 --> 09:53.594
Those were the only years I had.

09:53.629 --> 09:54.762
You thief!

09:54.797 --> 09:56.731
Margaret, please.
I'm gonna fix this.

09:56.765 --> 09:58.733
I'm seeing a doctor,

09:58.767 --> 10:03.338
a pioneer in the field--
Dr. Ellenberg.

10:03.372 --> 10:08.810
And he and I are gonna
take care of this problem...

10:08.844 --> 10:12.213
for good.

10:12.247 --> 10:15.216
I promise you.

10:16.156 --> 10:19.445
_

10:22.157 --> 10:24.225
Wheelchair
to Maternity Check-In.

10:24.259 --> 10:27.428
Wheelchair
to Maternity Check-In.

10:27.463 --> 10:31.566
I believe I did credit you
with our success in Tennessee.

10:31.600 --> 10:35.069
Yes, but we could
start a similar outreach here.

10:35.104 --> 10:37.572
We could gather all the female
employees at the hospital,

10:37.606 --> 10:39.607
and we could start a forum
on women's health.

10:39.641 --> 10:42.310
Maternity has already
agreed to institute pap smears.

10:42.344 --> 10:45.480
Well, yes, but it doesn't
always have to be about pap smears.

10:45.514 --> 10:48.750
For example, I read about
this doctor in Houston,

10:48.784 --> 10:52.653
and he's developed this film
that can detect breast cancers.

10:52.688 --> 10:53.988
It's like an X-ray.

10:54.022 --> 10:55.056
Robert Egan.

10:55.090 --> 10:57.058
He's had great success
detecting cancers

10:57.092 --> 10:58.760
in a breast after mastectomy--

10:58.794 --> 11:01.496
no success at all with breasts
still attached to a woman.

11:01.530 --> 11:05.400
Okay. But it's still a
radical, maybe lifesaving idea.

11:05.434 --> 11:08.669
My point is, there's a lot
you want to accomplish, Lillian,

11:08.704 --> 11:10.471
and I want to help you.

11:10.506 --> 11:11.806
There are many other
health issues--

11:11.840 --> 11:13.141
You know what I did see

11:13.175 --> 11:14.776
on the department board
this morning?

11:14.810 --> 11:17.211
Everybody saw it.
What is your point?

11:17.246 --> 11:19.414
It made me realize you're right.

11:19.448 --> 11:22.216
Stop complaining about Bill
and start emulating him.

11:22.251 --> 11:24.619
In fact, I'm off to find
the Chancellor now

11:24.653 --> 11:28.589
to show him just how much
of a Masters I can be.

11:44.173 --> 11:47.208
Expecting fireworks
this afternoon, Bill.

12:28.250 --> 12:30.551
Provost at Webster
called me directly,

12:30.586 --> 12:32.720
asked if he could
attend the presentation.

12:32.754 --> 12:34.155
I hope you said yes.

12:34.189 --> 12:36.157
Outside interest
only helps our cause.

12:36.191 --> 12:37.992
Your study's a cause now?

12:38.026 --> 12:40.194
It's always been.
You know that.

12:40.229 --> 12:42.196
It's all ahead for you, Bill.

12:42.231 --> 12:45.099
You'll wake up tomorrow and
everything will be different.

12:45.133 --> 12:48.002
We're having a dinner
tonight at the house to celebrate.

12:48.036 --> 12:50.204
I want you and Margaret
to be part of it.

12:50.239 --> 12:52.473
I appreciate that,
but there are...

12:52.508 --> 12:54.175
some personal issues.

12:54.209 --> 12:57.545
Look, Barton,
I know we hit a rough patch,

12:57.579 --> 13:00.815
and I-I know you only came around
to this work reluctantly--

13:00.849 --> 13:04.151
I was blackmailed.
Let's not mince words.

13:04.186 --> 13:06.721
But we need
to push past that now.

13:06.755 --> 13:08.823
We need to present
a united front.

13:08.857 --> 13:10.124
Against what?

13:10.158 --> 13:11.759
You're drawing bigger crowds

13:11.793 --> 13:13.895
than "Pajama Game"
at the drive-in.

13:13.929 --> 13:15.329
What do you need me for?

13:15.364 --> 13:17.665
I...

13:17.699 --> 13:19.133
I need you there.

13:19.167 --> 13:21.469
Because...

13:21.503 --> 13:25.206
today the work takes
center stage,

13:25.240 --> 13:28.276
and that's where it should be.

13:28.310 --> 13:32.113
And whatever comes from it...

13:32.147 --> 13:36.150
it will be credited
to us both...

13:36.184 --> 13:37.752
and that's how it should be.

13:40.556 --> 13:43.858
God help me.

13:43.892 --> 13:48.396
You always could bend
the universe to your will.

13:51.700 --> 13:55.770
I imagine
this is difficult for you.

13:55.804 --> 13:58.439
You cannot imagine.

13:58.473 --> 14:01.442
My life
has been turned inside out.

14:01.476 --> 14:05.846
You might as well tell me
the sun now sets in the east,

14:05.881 --> 14:07.982
that babies grow on trees.

14:08.016 --> 14:11.118
But if Barton
is embarking on a cure,

14:11.153 --> 14:14.221
I want to know what it is
because...

14:14.256 --> 14:18.125
Well, I cannot spend another
moment of my life in the dark.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.727
Okay.

14:19.761 --> 14:22.597
He's going to undergo
electroshock therapy.

14:22.631 --> 14:24.465
It's a psychiatric treatment

14:24.499 --> 14:27.435
in which seizures
are electrically induced--

14:27.469 --> 14:28.836
I know what it is.

14:28.870 --> 14:31.505
My friend Joan-- we play
mah-jongg every Wednesday--

14:31.540 --> 14:36.043
her mother's had electroshock,
many times.

14:36.078 --> 14:38.245
We've taken to calling it
"Head zapping."

14:38.280 --> 14:42.083
Well, there are
misconceptions about ECT.

14:42.117 --> 14:45.086
But electricity would be
pushed through Barton's brain, correct?

14:45.120 --> 14:48.122
He's anesthetized,
so it's painless.

14:48.156 --> 14:50.625
There must be consequences.

14:50.659 --> 14:52.493
The hoped-for consequence

14:52.527 --> 14:55.796
is your husband
no longer desires men.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.469
And there are side effects.
The biggest one is memory loss.

15:01.503 --> 15:03.771
It's usually temporary.

15:03.805 --> 15:07.241
Sometimes it's permanent.

15:07.275 --> 15:10.277
Can people... die?

15:10.312 --> 15:13.848
4 deaths in every 100,000.

15:13.882 --> 15:16.517
But those are very low odds.

15:16.551 --> 15:18.419
Surely there are other ways.

15:18.453 --> 15:19.920
Oh, there are.

15:19.955 --> 15:22.556
In fact, there have been
tremendous advances in science

15:22.591 --> 15:25.226
in terms of
curing homosexuality.

15:25.260 --> 15:29.030
There's something called
shock-aversion therapy.

15:29.064 --> 15:32.299
Sometimes we apply the shocks
directly to the genitals,

15:32.334 --> 15:36.270
which can enhance
the treatment's efficacy.

15:36.304 --> 15:39.774
There are psychotropic drugs.

15:39.808 --> 15:42.276
There's chemical castration.

15:42.310 --> 15:45.913
Chemical... castration?

15:45.947 --> 15:47.415
The good news is,

15:47.449 --> 15:49.650
your husband can beat this,
Mrs. Scully.

15:49.685 --> 15:54.088
We just have to find
the treatment that works best.

16:12.474 --> 16:13.974
_

16:21.950 --> 16:23.184
Dr. Masters, I was wondering--

16:23.218 --> 16:24.418
Jane, I said no distractions.

16:24.453 --> 16:25.720
Then I'll be quick.

16:25.754 --> 16:27.388
I was wondering if you invited
Virginia this afternoon,

16:27.422 --> 16:28.456
because I didn't.

16:28.490 --> 16:31.859
Is that a question?

16:31.893 --> 16:34.161
It's just...

16:34.196 --> 16:37.565
She put so much time into
this study, so much of herself.

16:37.599 --> 16:39.767
What Virginia does this
afternoon, or any afternoon,

16:39.801 --> 16:42.536
is none of our concern.

16:42.571 --> 16:44.038
She won't come
unless you ask her.

16:44.072 --> 16:45.139
She quit.

16:45.173 --> 16:46.507
And I resent you comin--

16:46.541 --> 16:48.275
Just a thought.

17:05.761 --> 17:09.230
God damn it.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.034
I'll be down the hall
for a moment.

17:16.204 --> 17:17.104
Bill.

17:21.943 --> 17:24.111
I just wanted to say,
uh, good luck.

17:24.146 --> 17:25.846
You were coming to see me?

17:25.881 --> 17:27.515
I was heading
in this direction, so...

17:27.549 --> 17:29.950
Actually, I, uh...

17:29.985 --> 17:32.686
Well, if you want to--

17:32.721 --> 17:34.889
Gini.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.624
Goodness.

17:36.658 --> 17:39.727
Look at you.

17:39.761 --> 17:42.096
I just ran out
for some stuffed olives.

17:42.130 --> 17:43.430
Bill had the inspired idea

17:43.465 --> 17:45.466
to serve Martinis
at the presentation.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.668
That is inspired.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.370
Sets the right tone.

17:49.404 --> 17:50.971
That's just what Bill said.

17:53.041 --> 17:56.477
Uh, anyway,
I'm sure, uh, Virginia's busy.

17:56.511 --> 17:58.512
We'll see you
at the presentation, though?

17:58.547 --> 17:59.647
Libby.

17:59.681 --> 18:00.815
Absolutely.
You must come.

18:00.849 --> 18:02.449
After all your efforts...

18:02.484 --> 18:04.318
Dr. DePaul and I
have a very full day.

18:04.352 --> 18:07.721
I just wanted to wish you both
the best--

18:07.756 --> 18:09.857
on the presentation
and the baby.

18:09.891 --> 18:12.993
That very sweet of you, Gini.

18:25.006 --> 18:26.473
Because I want
Bill Masters' deal.

18:26.508 --> 18:28.041
He has no secret deal.

18:28.076 --> 18:30.410
No secret to you, or to me now,

18:30.445 --> 18:32.813
that Masters' patients
pay him directly,

18:32.847 --> 18:34.448
that the university
doesn't touch that money,

18:34.482 --> 18:36.917
that it allows him
to pocket an extra 30%.

18:36.951 --> 18:39.286
Can I interest you
in a sandwich? It's on me.

18:39.320 --> 18:40.587
Coffee's fine.

18:40.622 --> 18:42.356
You might consider
cutting back on caffeine.

18:42.390 --> 18:44.758
I want your assurance
I can have the same arrangement.

18:47.095 --> 18:48.595
Bill Masters has that deal

18:48.630 --> 18:50.364
because of the enormous
amount of business

18:50.398 --> 18:51.899
he generates
for maternity hospital.

18:51.933 --> 18:54.701
Over the years, he's brought
literally thousands of patients

18:54.736 --> 18:55.903
through our doors.

18:55.937 --> 18:58.038
You have no patients.

18:58.072 --> 18:59.540
That's a gross exaggeration.

18:59.574 --> 19:01.008
How many?

19:01.042 --> 19:03.210
My numbers grow every day.

19:03.244 --> 19:04.678
Yes.

19:04.712 --> 19:07.748
And I see those numbers on my
weekly report from Accounting.

19:10.084 --> 19:11.685
The reason I have fewer patients

19:11.719 --> 19:13.887
is because the hospital doesn't
forward new patients to me.

19:13.922 --> 19:15.222
I'm last on the referral list

19:15.256 --> 19:17.057
when women call
and ask for an OB/GYN.

19:17.091 --> 19:18.959
12th.
You're 12th on the list.

19:18.993 --> 19:20.394
And you know why?

19:20.428 --> 19:21.662
We can't sell you.

19:21.696 --> 19:23.297
- To whom?
- To women.

19:23.331 --> 19:26.166
I brought you here because
of your impeccable credentials

19:26.201 --> 19:27.467
and the hunch obstetrics

19:27.502 --> 19:29.703
might be opening up
for female physicians.

19:29.737 --> 19:31.104
But I was wrong.

19:31.139 --> 19:33.607
Because when we <i>do</i> refer you,
women make it very clear

19:33.641 --> 19:36.476
they don't want another woman
looking up their skirt,

19:36.511 --> 19:39.479
except for the odd gal
who thinks that's just swell,

19:39.514 --> 19:42.282
and those 16 women
are your patients.

19:44.219 --> 19:47.387
And they receive the best
care this hospital has to offer.

19:47.422 --> 19:49.723
16 patients is not rainmaking.

19:49.757 --> 19:52.793
It's not even a drizzle.

19:52.827 --> 19:54.861
I'm on my way
to Masters' presentation.

19:54.896 --> 19:56.930
The entire hospital
is talking about it.

19:56.965 --> 19:59.866
Why don't you come up with
something to grab our attention?

19:59.901 --> 20:02.903
Maybe that will rearrange
the weather in <i>your</i> favor.

20:15.016 --> 20:16.950
It's a big day, huh?

20:19.420 --> 20:22.322
Strange to think
it started with us.

20:22.357 --> 20:26.126
Masters' study will continue.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.494
We can, too.

21:41.636 --> 21:43.337
"Martinis
are the only American invention

21:43.371 --> 21:45.806
as perfect as the sonnet."

21:47.575 --> 21:48.642
Up with invention.

21:48.676 --> 21:50.377
Down with sonnets.

21:50.411 --> 21:53.413
Those are actually
HL Mencken's words, but, uh...

21:53.448 --> 21:57.184
I have been engaged
in an invention of sorts--

21:57.218 --> 22:01.888
a study that began in earnest
a year ago.

22:01.923 --> 22:04.324
But in truth...

22:04.359 --> 22:08.795
is a project more than 20 years
in the making.

22:08.830 --> 22:12.799
As we went about our business,
we discovered, more than once,

22:12.834 --> 22:16.603
a stethoscope pressed up against
the walls of Exam Room 5.

22:18.906 --> 22:23.443
I took your curiosity
and speculation as a good sign.

22:23.478 --> 22:28.782
But those days of secrecy
are over.

22:28.816 --> 22:33.854
I am opening the door
of Exam Room 5,

22:33.888 --> 22:39.960
and I'm eager to share with you
my groundbreaking discoveries.

22:41.929 --> 22:46.500
What happens to the body
during sex?

22:46.534 --> 22:50.270
The one thing you can't do
is take people's word for it.

22:51.706 --> 22:56.076
Lies, half-truths, delusions,
significant omissions--

22:56.110 --> 22:58.278
what people wish were true--

22:58.312 --> 23:02.449
will always muddy the waters
of scientific objectivity.

23:02.483 --> 23:05.519
So, I wired them up.

23:07.655 --> 23:11.158
How many victims--
I mean subjects, Bill?

23:11.192 --> 23:13.093
So far?

23:13.127 --> 23:20.400
186 volunteers that participated
in 458 individual acts of sex.

23:20.435 --> 23:22.436
So happy you came.

23:22.470 --> 23:25.872
Now, if you're
interested in raw data,

23:25.907 --> 23:29.009
I've collected it all together
for you to read in the back.

23:29.043 --> 23:31.378
But if you want to know
what we learned--

23:31.446 --> 23:33.814
Who's "We," Dr. Masters?

23:42.256 --> 23:45.158
It's the royal "We," Dr. DePaul.

23:48.996 --> 23:54.100
Sex, it turns out,
has a pattern.

23:54.135 --> 23:55.535
When sexually stimulated...

23:57.805 --> 23:59.439
both men and women pass through

23:59.474 --> 24:02.242
what are essentially
four separate stages

24:02.276 --> 24:04.044
of physiological response--

24:04.078 --> 24:07.747
excitement, plateau,

24:07.782 --> 24:11.918
orgasm, and resolution.

24:20.795 --> 24:25.165
Furthermore, we were able
to disprove many myths.

24:25.199 --> 24:29.169
For example, uncircumcised men

24:29.203 --> 24:33.306
do not have more ejaculatory
control than circumcised men.

24:33.341 --> 24:36.610
Circumcision doesn't affect
impotency one way or another.

24:36.644 --> 24:41.081
The male orgasm does not
deplete physical strength.

24:41.115 --> 24:44.084
So, if you have a big golf game
this coming Sunday,

24:44.118 --> 24:46.853
please, have all the sex
you want Saturday night.

24:48.422 --> 24:50.190
My weekend just improved.

24:50.224 --> 24:53.193
And rest assured, in
terms of pleasing your partner,

24:53.227 --> 24:56.963
"Bigger is better"
turns out to be another myth.

24:56.998 --> 24:58.565
Our research revealed

24:58.599 --> 25:01.801
that smaller penises
expand more when erect,

25:01.836 --> 25:04.304
larger penises expand less,

25:04.338 --> 25:09.342
meaning most erections land
in a small statistical middle.

25:09.377 --> 25:13.813
Combined with the distensive
property of the vaginal barrel,

25:13.848 --> 25:16.716
a canal being as snug
around a gloved finger

25:16.751 --> 25:18.652
as it is around a baby's head,

25:18.686 --> 25:22.322
it turns out a woman does
accommodate a small penis

25:22.356 --> 25:26.192
as pleasurably as a large one.

25:26.227 --> 25:27.627
And I can speak for myself

25:27.662 --> 25:31.531
when I say you've done a great
service here today, Dr. Masters.

25:31.566 --> 25:33.567
Let's hear it
for the little guys, huh?

25:34.602 --> 25:37.270
Right, Bob?

25:38.673 --> 25:43.643
And so,
let's move on to the girls.

25:46.080 --> 25:52.052
This is the vaginal
canal during sexual stimulation.

25:52.086 --> 25:53.119
Oh, God.

25:53.154 --> 25:54.854
Note the uniform lubrication--

25:54.889 --> 25:56.990
actually a "sweating" phenomena.

25:57.024 --> 25:58.358
Nobody knows it's you.

25:58.392 --> 26:02.329
Note the wall color,
the darker, purplish hue,

26:02.363 --> 26:06.800
as we arrive at
the orgasmic phase,

26:06.834 --> 26:09.369
when the entire vaginal barrel

26:09.403 --> 26:12.505
undergoes contractions
during orgasm,

26:12.540 --> 26:14.975
similar to an accelerated labor.

26:15.009 --> 26:21.815
Until now, no one knew
these contractions existed.

26:21.849 --> 26:25.952
And yet here they are.
And we can measure them.

26:25.987 --> 26:29.189
But that's not the whole story

26:29.223 --> 26:31.925
when it comes
to the female orgasm.

26:37.031 --> 26:40.066
Note the muscle contractions
in the hands and feet--

26:40.101 --> 26:41.968
myotonia.

26:42.003 --> 26:43.236
The skin flush...

26:43.270 --> 26:45.739
- Who is that?
- ...vasocongestion.

26:45.773 --> 26:47.741
The erect nipples...

26:49.944 --> 26:51.678
...perspiration,
hyperventilation.

26:51.712 --> 26:56.616
Physiological reactions
are uniform and consistent.

26:56.651 --> 26:59.052
Which brings us
to the heart of the study

26:59.086 --> 27:04.124
and the most radical
discovery of all--

27:04.158 --> 27:06.626
when it comes to sex,

27:06.661 --> 27:11.865
women have capabilities
vastly superior to men.

27:11.899 --> 27:13.767
They can achieve
multiple orgasms,

27:13.801 --> 27:16.503
they're orgasmic
after menopause,

27:16.537 --> 27:20.373
and the sexual satisfaction
they can achieve on their own

27:20.408 --> 27:24.077
is equal to,
and sometimes even greater,

27:24.111 --> 27:26.479
than the satisfaction
they achieve with men.

27:29.784 --> 27:30.950
I think that's, uh, enough.

27:30.985 --> 27:32.919
There are women
in the room, Bill.

27:32.953 --> 27:35.055
There were women
in the study, Chuck.

27:35.089 --> 27:37.257
We'll reconvene
in my office later.

27:37.291 --> 27:39.325
Actually,
I-I have a Q&A planned.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.429
This kind of smut does
not belong in this hospital.

28:18.265 --> 28:19.999
Of course they'll settle down.

28:20.034 --> 28:21.401
They'll have to.

28:21.435 --> 28:22.969
You remember how you first
reacted when you saw our work.

28:23.003 --> 28:25.238
I'd supported you for 20 years.
I was your friend.

28:25.272 --> 28:27.507
You think I don't know
the resentment in this hospital

28:27.541 --> 28:29.242
toward me because of my stature,
my position.

28:29.276 --> 28:31.544
Then why put out a fire
with gunpowder today?

28:31.578 --> 28:34.013
I was presenting my work!

28:36.050 --> 28:38.384
Maybe it was a miscalculation
to think my colleagues

28:38.419 --> 28:40.620
could be the first ones
exposed to this material,

28:40.654 --> 28:43.022
given their petty jealousies,
their insecurities.

28:43.057 --> 28:44.624
This goes
beyond jealousies, Bill.

28:44.658 --> 28:46.225
Now is not the time
to give in to small minds.

28:46.260 --> 28:47.493
You know what I'm gonna do?

28:47.528 --> 28:49.128
I'm gonna publish this
as a paper

28:49.163 --> 28:51.097
in the Obstetrics
and Gynecology Journal.

28:51.131 --> 28:53.766
Makes more sense to go through
established channels anyway.

28:53.801 --> 28:56.202
Those were the established
channels right there in that room.

28:56.236 --> 28:57.804
So this is what,
you're turning on me now, too?

28:57.838 --> 28:59.205
Jesus,
this is what you always do.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.674
The first sign of trouble
and you're gone, out the door!

29:01.709 --> 29:04.377
That's bullshit, Bill,
and you know it.

29:04.411 --> 29:07.580
No one has gone further out
on a limb for you than I have.

29:07.614 --> 29:10.616
I'm gonna back you on this
because the work is good.

29:10.651 --> 29:12.719
And I resent
that small-mindedness,

29:12.753 --> 29:15.922
that oppressive choke hold
of establishment thinking.

29:15.956 --> 29:17.490
I've had a lifetime of it.

29:20.861 --> 29:23.396
So, fuck them.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.034
Yes, exactly.

29:28.068 --> 29:30.703
Fuck them.

29:33.974 --> 29:38.177
Thank you.

29:38.212 --> 29:39.545
He's not in Barton's office.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.481
Everyone hurried out
so quickly,

29:41.515 --> 29:43.016
I couldn't distribute the study.

29:43.050 --> 29:46.719
Although, Ethel from Accounting
took two copies,

29:46.754 --> 29:47.854
she was so impressed.

29:50.257 --> 29:53.559
Dr. Masters' office.

29:53.594 --> 29:55.061
Right.

29:55.095 --> 29:57.263
Yes.

29:57.297 --> 29:58.831
Oh.

29:58.866 --> 30:01.034
I'm-- I'm sorry to hear
that you can't make it.

30:05.105 --> 30:06.839
By the time I get back
to my airless dungeon,

30:06.874 --> 30:08.574
everyone's gonna know it was me
that shot that film.

30:08.609 --> 30:09.675
You filmed that naked woman?

30:09.710 --> 30:11.044
No. I don't know
who shot that,

30:11.078 --> 30:14.047
but the film of your...
insides... has my signature style

30:14.081 --> 30:16.449
all over it,
and it's gonna cost me my job.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.117
Dr. Masters will defend you.

30:18.152 --> 30:19.552
Hello, Dr. Rish.

30:19.586 --> 30:20.920
I suspect he has his hands full.

30:20.954 --> 30:22.922
Then <i>I</i> will defend you.

30:22.956 --> 30:25.758
- I understand.
- Not only was it... pretty,

30:25.793 --> 30:28.027
with camera angles or whatever,

30:28.062 --> 30:29.996
the whole point of it
was for science.

30:30.030 --> 30:32.298
And frankly, this hospital
should be supporting

30:32.332 --> 30:35.134
more of that, and I will say
that to anyone who will listen,

30:35.169 --> 30:38.504
even the Chancellor
of the university himself.

30:43.577 --> 30:44.744
I need to make some calls.

30:44.778 --> 30:46.012
If I could have
the wheeldex please.

30:46.046 --> 30:47.146
Bill...

30:47.181 --> 30:48.314
I'm fine.

30:48.348 --> 30:50.049
Are you sure?

30:50.084 --> 30:52.785
Dr. Rish just called

30:52.820 --> 30:55.054
to cancel
for our dinner tonight.

30:58.192 --> 31:00.560
Well, we're better off
without him.

31:00.594 --> 31:02.595
I'd rather tonight's dinner
be only people

31:02.629 --> 31:04.197
who appreciated the work.

31:04.231 --> 31:06.332
Well, Ethel certainly
appreciated it.

31:06.366 --> 31:08.101
I think it was just
the insecure men

31:08.135 --> 31:10.236
that didn't want to hear
about how women are,

31:10.270 --> 31:13.473
you know... sexually superior.

31:13.507 --> 31:15.408
People didn't want to hear about

31:15.442 --> 31:17.276
the Theory
of Natural Selection, either.

31:17.311 --> 31:20.079
They wanted to believe that God
created the world in seven days,

31:20.114 --> 31:22.648
not that man evolved from apes.

31:22.683 --> 31:25.751
Darwin was attacked by
both scientists and the church,

31:25.786 --> 31:27.653
and yet it's Darwin
that survived.

31:27.688 --> 31:28.955
And Elvis Presley.

31:28.989 --> 31:31.924
He was panned on "The Milton
Berle Show" last year.

31:31.959 --> 31:33.659
Couldn't even show him
from the waist down.

31:33.694 --> 31:36.162
And he was accused
of being obscene, by the way.

31:36.196 --> 31:38.297
Now he's in "Jailhouse Rock"
and his swiveling hips

31:38.332 --> 31:40.266
are 20-feet wide
on every big screen in America.

31:41.502 --> 31:42.502
Exactly.

31:49.042 --> 31:50.476
Forward my calls to reception.

31:50.511 --> 31:51.511
You can take
the rest of the day off.

31:51.545 --> 31:52.778
Dr. Masters, that's not necess--

31:52.813 --> 31:54.180
And, Libby, you can go, too.

31:54.214 --> 31:56.682
We have guests tonight.
We should be ready for them.

31:56.717 --> 31:59.986
And I need a quiet office.
I have a lot of work to do.

32:03.257 --> 32:06.559
<i>The sky this far above</i>
<i>the earth is purplish-black,</i>

32:06.593 --> 32:13.366
<i>and against that is... well,</i>
<i>many heavenly wonders.</i>

32:13.400 --> 32:16.869
He's up there right now.

32:16.904 --> 32:19.539
19 miles above the Earth.

32:19.573 --> 32:21.140
<i>Beyond the haze,</i>

32:21.175 --> 32:24.844
<i>there are thin bands of blue</i>
<i>etched against the night sky.</i>

32:24.878 --> 32:27.747
<i>They appear to be</i>
<i>thin shells of dust</i>

32:27.781 --> 32:31.651
<i>that hover over the Earth</i>
<i>like a succession of halos.</i>

32:31.685 --> 32:33.853
Major Simons is such a hero.

32:33.887 --> 32:36.155
He is.

32:36.190 --> 32:37.890
But... there are lots of people

32:37.925 --> 32:40.359
that helped get Major Simons
into space,

32:40.394 --> 32:42.562
like those men
sitting right there.

32:42.596 --> 32:44.197
- They're helpers?
- Mm-hmm.

32:44.231 --> 32:47.667
Yes, it takes helpers
to do great things.

32:47.701 --> 32:51.938
<i>...atmospheric layers,</i>
<i>and the stars at 100,000 feet</i>

32:51.972 --> 32:56.375
<i>do not twinkle,</i>
<i>but shine steadily.</i>

33:04.518 --> 33:06.352
Do you want anything else?

33:06.386 --> 33:08.988
We have enough food
for 20 people.

33:15.862 --> 33:21.100
I-I wish I had seen that film...

33:21.134 --> 33:23.302
of the woman
before you showed it.

33:23.337 --> 33:25.204
And that would've changed what?

33:25.239 --> 33:30.243
I would've warned you
against it.

33:30.277 --> 33:34.046
You're used to seeing bodies in
the throes of passion like that,

33:34.081 --> 33:37.617
but it's... Well, it's--
it was a little shocking to me

33:37.651 --> 33:39.919
and to the other doctors,
as well.

33:39.953 --> 33:41.821
Doctors see
naked bodies every day.

33:41.855 --> 33:44.724
They don't see them having sex.

33:52.466 --> 33:56.102
Who was that woman--
in the film at the end?

33:59.006 --> 34:01.674
What difference does that make?

34:01.708 --> 34:05.578
The two doctors sitting next
to me thought it was Virginia.

34:09.349 --> 34:11.449
Of course they did.

34:11.485 --> 34:14.286
Since they were already
acting like...

34:14.321 --> 34:18.090
naughty schoolboys, spying
on the naked neighbor lady.

34:18.125 --> 34:20.659
You know, I've had 111 women
in my study,

34:20.694 --> 34:24.063
I have hundreds of feet of film,

34:24.097 --> 34:29.001
and yet I go and pick Virginia
as my subject?

34:29.036 --> 34:30.303
Does that make any sense to you?

34:30.337 --> 34:34.072
No.

34:34.107 --> 34:36.976
No, I-I...

34:37.010 --> 34:39.844
can't imagine why she'd
compromise herself like that.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.148
You've answered
your own question.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.850
But you haven't answered mine.

34:44.885 --> 34:48.286
Who was that woman?

34:52.759 --> 34:55.995
You know I can't say.

35:07.808 --> 35:12.478
Barton...
I spoke to Dr. Ellenberg today.

35:16.149 --> 35:19.985
I mean, some of those
supposed cures

35:20.020 --> 35:22.722
sounded primitive, at best.

35:22.756 --> 35:25.458
Some sounded... worse.

35:25.492 --> 35:29.328
Well, castration
is off the table.

35:29.363 --> 35:33.799
I suppose electrocuting
your genitals is also a pass?

35:33.834 --> 35:37.970
Margaret,
I'm doing the right thing.

35:38.004 --> 35:40.940
Electroshock has been around
for more than 20 years.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.141
It's been tested.

35:42.175 --> 35:45.878
It's now a perfectly acceptable
form of therapy.

35:45.912 --> 35:47.313
But Joan's mother

35:47.347 --> 35:49.014
doesn't remember
she has a granddaughter.

35:49.049 --> 35:51.083
We don't have grandchildren.

35:51.118 --> 35:54.720
What if you forget
you love to overtip everyone

35:54.755 --> 35:56.756
everywhere we go?

35:56.790 --> 35:58.724
What if you forget
how Vivian smiles

35:58.759 --> 36:01.394
when you sing
"You Are My Sunshine"?

36:01.428 --> 36:02.895
Wh-wh-what if you forget

36:02.929 --> 36:05.531
you've never won a tennis match
against me,

36:05.565 --> 36:08.167
not once, not ever?

36:08.201 --> 36:09.468
I let you win.

36:09.503 --> 36:11.637
Well, what if you forget that?

36:14.341 --> 36:19.078
Margaret,
what would you have me do?

36:19.112 --> 36:22.148
I need to fix this thing.

36:28.555 --> 36:32.825
If you don't fix it, I...

36:32.859 --> 36:37.530
I don't know what kind of future
we can possibly have.

36:37.564 --> 36:44.003
But, I mean, listening
to that doctor, I thought...

36:44.037 --> 36:46.705
for all of our problems...

36:46.740 --> 36:50.576
this is still
30 years of a life--

36:50.610 --> 36:56.749
not the life I thought I had,
but the life I got...

36:56.783 --> 37:00.986
with a man...

37:01.021 --> 37:02.788
that I do love.

37:05.559 --> 37:08.961
Margaret, I don't want
to cause you any more distress

37:08.995 --> 37:10.863
than I already have.

37:10.897 --> 37:15.201
If you don't want me to do it,
I won't.

37:15.235 --> 37:17.403
I don't-- I don't think I do.

37:33.286 --> 37:36.722
We already have a hundred
signatures. He's finished.

37:36.756 --> 37:40.025
I have half a mind
to just rip it from their hands.

37:40.060 --> 37:43.162
I can't believe they think
a petition is going to stop Bill.

37:43.196 --> 37:45.998
Mrs. Johnson,
that was more of you

37:46.032 --> 37:47.900
than I needed to see yesterday.

37:47.934 --> 37:49.168
What did you just say?

37:49.202 --> 37:52.037
I'm sorry, but that is just
ridiculous and rude.

37:52.072 --> 37:53.172
And true.

37:53.206 --> 37:55.307
I can see that you wish it were.

38:03.416 --> 38:05.684
There's got to be a better way.

38:05.719 --> 38:08.220
Lillian,
I couldn't sleep last night,

38:08.255 --> 38:11.557
and so I picked up the latest
journal of gynecology,

38:11.591 --> 38:14.026
and there's this pill
that's been developed

38:14.060 --> 38:15.594
for irregular menstrual cycles

38:15.629 --> 38:17.930
that actually functions
as birth control.

38:17.964 --> 38:21.901
Mm-hmm. That's Gregory Pincus'
work, funded by Margaret Sanger.

38:21.935 --> 38:25.237
But the FDA has only approved it
for severe menstrual disorders.

38:25.272 --> 38:26.972
Yes, but now large
numbers of women

38:27.007 --> 38:28.541
are reporting
severe menstrual disorders

38:28.575 --> 38:30.075
just so they can
get their hands on it.

38:30.110 --> 38:32.912
It has serious side effects.

38:32.946 --> 38:35.381
Yes, but...

38:35.415 --> 38:37.683
a contraceptive pill.

38:37.717 --> 38:40.085
Just imagine
what that could do for women.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.453
I'm not following your point.

38:41.488 --> 38:42.521
The women's forum.

38:42.556 --> 38:44.523
Why isn't this
something we can explore?

38:44.558 --> 38:45.724
It's a distraction.

38:45.759 --> 38:47.760
We have work to do
right here in front of us.

38:47.794 --> 38:49.895
Lillian, you're a doctor.

38:49.930 --> 38:51.664
You are in the perfect position

38:51.698 --> 38:54.533
to be on the ground floor
something thrilling,

38:54.568 --> 38:55.935
a pioneer in a new field!

38:55.969 --> 38:57.937
I don't have time
for thrilling or "new fields,"

38:57.971 --> 38:59.238
as you know.

38:59.272 --> 39:02.041
I know.
I-- I'm sorry. I mean--

39:02.075 --> 39:03.709
My work is to--

39:03.743 --> 39:05.544
To make pap smears available
to every woman in the country.

39:05.579 --> 39:06.712
I know.

39:09.015 --> 39:12.217
It's not glamorous.
It's painstaking and it's slow.

39:12.252 --> 39:14.453
I know that.
But it is an honest goal.

39:14.487 --> 39:15.955
The one thing I can do

39:15.989 --> 39:18.190
that will hopefully
make a difference.

39:18.224 --> 39:20.125
Why isn't that enough for you?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.760
One small step at a time,
Virginia.

39:21.795 --> 39:23.162
There's nothing wrong with that.

39:26.232 --> 39:28.667
80 signatures
as of this morning--

39:28.702 --> 39:31.036
doctors, administrators,
board members...

39:31.071 --> 39:33.439
Now even people that
didn't see your presentation

39:33.473 --> 39:35.107
want your study shut down.

39:35.141 --> 39:37.343
I will not move my study
out of this hospital again, Barton.

39:37.377 --> 39:38.544
I refuse.

39:38.578 --> 39:40.879
No, it's more
complicated than that.

39:40.914 --> 39:45.851
Chancellor Fitzhugh is waiting
for us in his office right now.

39:45.885 --> 39:49.221
We're both being let go.

39:49.255 --> 39:52.458
As in... fired?

39:52.492 --> 39:54.560
That-- No, that's a bluff.

39:54.594 --> 39:56.695
With the money
I bring into this hospital?

39:56.730 --> 39:58.397
It's no bluff.
I got word this morning.

39:58.431 --> 39:59.732
It's a done deal.

39:59.766 --> 40:03.535
He felt utterly blindsided
by what he saw yesterday--

40:03.570 --> 40:04.937
what everyone saw.

40:04.971 --> 40:07.239
Made him look stupid.
He felt humiliated.

40:07.273 --> 40:10.009
But more than that,
it scared him.

40:10.043 --> 40:12.211
Naked bodies, having sex--

40:12.245 --> 40:15.881
that's not something
the board can tolerate.

40:15.915 --> 40:17.983
Heads must roll.

40:18.018 --> 40:23.422
So Fitzhugh is firing us
to save his own ass.

40:48.481 --> 40:51.483
The truth is, Bill...

40:51.518 --> 40:53.786
as much as I've loved you
like a son,

40:53.820 --> 40:56.055
championed you
as best I could...

40:57.490 --> 41:01.293
I was always
a little envious of you.

41:01.327 --> 41:06.665
You have gifts that I don't--
raw talent, a vision.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.967
You are
an excellent doctor, Barton.

41:09.002 --> 41:11.336
That was one of the reasons
I looked up to you.

41:11.371 --> 41:14.206
Then I took the easy way out--

41:14.240 --> 41:20.245
made a living,
supported a wife and daughter.

41:20.280 --> 41:24.149
But now...

41:24.184 --> 41:26.351
at my age...

41:33.560 --> 41:39.331
You'll have a good chance
of landing on your feet.

41:39.365 --> 41:40.799
That's what matters.

42:02.589 --> 42:03.889
Guess what I'm looking at.

42:03.923 --> 42:05.023
Mickey Mouse.

42:05.058 --> 42:06.658
I-I couldn't find
Mickey Mouse's star

42:06.693 --> 42:07.960
on Hollywood Boulevard
yesterday.

42:07.994 --> 42:11.997
I did, however, see the new
Capitol Records building.

42:12.031 --> 42:15.033
Was that that crazy
round building

42:15.068 --> 42:16.969
where Nat King Cole records?

42:17.003 --> 42:18.537
Did you know
that there is a light

42:18.571 --> 42:19.772
on the top of that building

42:19.806 --> 42:22.908
that blinks out the word
"Hollywood" in morse code?

42:22.942 --> 42:26.812
No, I didn't know that.

42:26.846 --> 42:29.715
And now I'm looking
at the Pacific Ocean.

42:29.749 --> 42:34.586
Well, now I'm looking
at Stella transcribe dictation.

42:34.621 --> 42:36.221
You win.

42:36.256 --> 42:39.625
I also have some big news.

42:39.659 --> 42:41.794
I did get an offer from UCLA.

42:41.828 --> 42:43.762
See? I told you.

42:43.797 --> 42:46.532
Now you have
the leverage you need.

42:46.566 --> 42:48.300
It's a game-changing offer.

42:48.334 --> 42:50.235
Oh?

42:50.270 --> 42:53.071
And this is not how
I intended to do this.

42:53.106 --> 42:57.109
But... I don't want to wait.

43:00.847 --> 43:04.683
I love you, Virginia.

43:04.717 --> 43:07.019
I have from day one.

43:07.053 --> 43:10.189
And... I love your kids,

43:10.223 --> 43:15.160
love them
as if they were my own.

43:15.195 --> 43:17.529
And no matter what job I take,

43:17.564 --> 43:21.767
I want you and them
there with me, for good.

43:23.803 --> 43:25.671
So...

43:28.675 --> 43:30.843
will you marry me?

43:35.815 --> 43:38.217
Ethan, I'm--
I'm not sure Stella

43:38.251 --> 43:40.252
should be
a part of this discussion.

43:43.056 --> 43:46.758
You can answer when I get back.

43:46.793 --> 43:51.864
But whatever kind of life
you want for yourself,

43:51.898 --> 43:55.868
for your kids, it's yours.

44:14.921 --> 44:17.556
That wasn't science.
Pornography, maybe.

44:17.590 --> 44:19.458
Grossly inappropriate,
certainly.

44:19.492 --> 44:22.027
But mostly that debacle of yours
was a violation

44:22.061 --> 44:25.397
of everything this hospital
and university stand for,

44:25.431 --> 44:27.699
undertaken,
without my knowledge,

44:27.734 --> 44:29.868
by the two men I trusted most.

44:31.938 --> 44:36.074
I've been trying to get my head
around it, but frankly, I can't.

44:36.109 --> 44:39.177
This study
has been going on for a year?

44:39.212 --> 44:41.847
In hospital exam rooms,
using hospital equipment?

44:41.881 --> 44:43.448
You were happy enough

44:43.483 --> 44:46.385
when those rooms and equipment
generated huge revenues,

44:46.419 --> 44:49.388
monies that bolstered
your position with the board.

44:49.422 --> 44:52.190
Didn't hurt you at bonus time,
either, I'm sure.

44:52.225 --> 44:53.926
I gave you a special deal.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.995
And I gave you a
world-class obstetrics department.

44:57.030 --> 45:01.199
I've made a mistake
with you, Bill.

45:01.234 --> 45:04.102
It's clear to me you've been
given far too much rope

45:04.137 --> 45:06.972
to hang yourself by a man
far too weak to stop you.

45:07.006 --> 45:09.574
Which brings to me
a very difficult decision.

45:09.609 --> 45:12.377
The truth is, if you had
supported me from the beginning,

45:12.412 --> 45:13.946
this wouldn't have
happened at all.

45:13.980 --> 45:15.514
I-I'm sorry?

45:15.548 --> 45:17.983
The reason I hid
my study from you, Barton,

45:18.017 --> 45:20.719
is because
I knew you'd forbid it.

45:20.753 --> 45:24.556
I came to you years ago
and told you of my plan

45:24.590 --> 45:28.026
to, uh, crack the mysteries
of human sexuality,

45:28.061 --> 45:29.728
but you flatly said no.

45:29.762 --> 45:32.531
You couldn't see
this was the future.

45:32.565 --> 45:35.334
You-- you couldn't envision
the accolades and acclaim

45:35.368 --> 45:38.570
that such innovative work
would bring to this hospital.

45:38.604 --> 45:41.573
Acclaim?
Are you drunk?

45:41.607 --> 45:43.308
That so-called work is obscene.

45:43.343 --> 45:44.609
You didn't have the strength.

45:44.644 --> 45:46.778
That's the one thing
the Chancellor did get right.

45:46.813 --> 45:50.682
And because you were weak,
I went around you.

45:50.717 --> 45:54.786
I did use hospital exam rooms.
I did use hospital equipment.

45:54.821 --> 45:56.288
And I used the money

45:56.322 --> 45:59.725
you thought I was using
for infertility research

45:59.759 --> 46:01.827
on sex instead.

46:01.861 --> 46:04.363
In which case, Barton,
you've been bamboozled

46:04.397 --> 46:08.066
by our lying, arrogant employee
worse than I've been.

46:11.637 --> 46:16.041
I leave the honors to you.
You know what needs to be done.

46:23.383 --> 46:26.184
I will continue
my study at this hospital...

46:28.621 --> 46:33.892
no matter what you say today,
no matter what you do.

46:42.268 --> 46:44.503
You won't, Bill.

46:44.537 --> 46:46.638
You're fired.

46:54.714 --> 46:58.784
The Urban League is so grateful
for all your generosity, ma'am.

46:58.818 --> 47:01.753
I'm sorry I couldn't
drive them over myself.

47:01.788 --> 47:04.589
I feel like I'm carrying
a sack of cement today.

47:04.624 --> 47:10.095
Of course you do.

47:10.129 --> 47:12.264
You know, we also take donations
for our nursery,

47:12.298 --> 47:13.498
and we have a dental clinic.

47:13.533 --> 47:16.234
Aah! Aah!

47:16.269 --> 47:17.969
Oh, my God.

47:18.004 --> 47:19.571
What is it, ma'am?

47:19.605 --> 47:22.274
I need to call my husband.

47:32.885 --> 47:34.753
We have to go back to Fitzhugh.

47:34.787 --> 47:36.054
It won't change anything.

47:36.089 --> 47:38.990
But I can't let this
stand. I can't. It was--

47:39.025 --> 47:41.059
The only thing to do.

47:41.094 --> 47:43.929
It made no sense
for us both to go.

47:46.232 --> 47:47.966
Dear God.

47:50.636 --> 47:53.105
What a thing.

47:57.477 --> 48:00.078
It was Fitzhugh's
secretary who told Patsy

48:00.113 --> 48:04.649
who told me
that Dr. Masters was fired.

48:04.684 --> 48:06.318
Fired!

48:06.352 --> 48:07.752
That's like firing God.

48:07.787 --> 48:08.987
I feel so ashamed.

48:09.021 --> 48:11.256
What? Why?

48:11.290 --> 48:13.492
Because I showed myself...

48:13.526 --> 48:17.062
my insides, my...

48:17.096 --> 48:19.898
vaginal walls.

48:19.932 --> 48:21.466
And those doctors thought
that it was dirty

48:21.501 --> 48:22.901
or that something
went horribly wrong,

48:22.935 --> 48:24.803
and now it's as if I brought
down the entire kingdom.

48:24.837 --> 48:26.271
That's not what those
doctors thought, not about you.

48:26.305 --> 48:27.572
How do you know?

48:27.607 --> 48:30.709
Because I've seen more
of you, down there,

48:30.743 --> 48:32.244
than anybody,

48:32.278 --> 48:36.348
and I think
your vaginal walls...

48:36.382 --> 48:39.384
are beautiful.

48:39.418 --> 48:41.786
You're just saying that.

48:41.821 --> 48:45.023
I think the up-top parts
are beautiful, too.

48:45.057 --> 48:49.728
In fact,
I think everything about you...

48:49.762 --> 48:51.296
is perfect.

48:59.305 --> 49:00.805
I'm sorry.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.641
I didn't-- Uh, I'll come back.

49:02.675 --> 49:03.775
No, Gini, come in.

49:03.809 --> 49:06.077
What a day.

49:06.112 --> 49:08.813
Uh, you don't
have to leave, Lester.

49:08.848 --> 49:10.782
I do.
Believe me. I do.

49:13.219 --> 49:16.454
Can you believe it?
All of this just gone.

49:16.489 --> 49:18.990
All these offices just gone.

49:19.025 --> 49:21.326
Everything that he and you
and me and Lester

49:21.360 --> 49:22.794
worked so hard on is just--

49:22.828 --> 49:24.329
Gone. Where is he?

49:24.363 --> 49:27.766
He called to say he'd
be out for the rest of the day.

49:27.800 --> 49:30.902
I don't know.

49:30.937 --> 49:34.773
Do I pack up or...?

49:40.546 --> 49:43.782
Bill can live
without almost anything

49:43.816 --> 49:45.850
but not without his work.

49:45.885 --> 49:49.421
And such good work...

49:49.455 --> 49:50.789
from such a brilliant man.

49:54.627 --> 49:56.328
A souvenir, I guess.

49:56.362 --> 49:57.862
Or a doorstop.

50:10.042 --> 50:11.743
Ma'am, I don't think
we're gonna make it across town.

50:11.777 --> 50:13.011
We have to. I need--

50:13.045 --> 50:14.846
Mnh-mnh,
my hospital's two blocks over.

50:14.880 --> 50:17.182
I'm taking you over there.

50:17.216 --> 50:19.584
Now, what this is, ma'am,
is a precipitous labor,

50:19.619 --> 50:20.819
so we'll get you in a room--

50:20.853 --> 50:22.821
Precipitous labor?
Wh-what is that?

50:22.855 --> 50:24.022
Quick.

50:24.056 --> 50:25.323
Apparently, your baby
has a train to catch.

50:25.358 --> 50:26.691
No, no, I can't be here.

50:26.726 --> 50:28.426
I'm supposed to deliver
at Maternity.

50:28.461 --> 50:30.228
Well, where you don't
want to be

50:30.263 --> 50:31.997
is sitting in a car
on Charles Avenue.

50:32.031 --> 50:35.166
You don't. I don't.
Listen to her.

50:42.608 --> 50:47.345
I'm starting
electroshock treatments.

50:47.380 --> 50:51.950
I told Margaret I wouldn't,
but I have to do something.

50:51.984 --> 50:57.956
I've done two things right
in my life-- you and my family.

50:57.990 --> 51:01.226
But maybe I can get something
else right, something ahead,

51:01.260 --> 51:04.162
if I fix myself.

51:04.196 --> 51:07.966
You know the risks
of electroshock as well as I do.

51:08.000 --> 51:10.435
Well, what endeavor
doesn't have risks?

51:10.469 --> 51:12.037
As we've seen.

51:12.071 --> 51:14.773
But the reward...

51:14.807 --> 51:18.443
The reward
can make me a new man.

51:18.477 --> 51:22.647
Now, haven't we spent our whole
lives believing in science?

51:22.682 --> 51:25.717
We have.

51:25.751 --> 51:31.856
So, tomorrow I'll admit
myself, I'll have my treatment,

51:31.891 --> 51:35.260
and then I'll go home cured

51:35.294 --> 51:37.896
to a wife I love,

51:37.930 --> 51:41.966
to a better future,
to a job, thanks to you.

51:45.471 --> 51:48.440
But tonight...

51:48.474 --> 51:51.543
I'm worried about you.

51:51.577 --> 51:54.412
What are you gonna do, Bill?

51:56.649 --> 51:58.316
The same.

52:01.387 --> 52:03.221
I'm gonna go home.

52:55.007 --> 52:57.876
Dr. Masters...

52:59.912 --> 53:01.312
sorry about the locks.

53:06.886 --> 53:09.354
I, uh...

53:09.388 --> 53:13.925
Well, I certainly wouldn't want
to have to escort you out.

53:54.188 --> 53:58.379
_

54:12.985 --> 54:14.919
Mom.
Mom, come look!

54:14.954 --> 54:17.222
<i>The craft has now touched down.</i>

54:17.256 --> 54:19.958
<i>The pod door is opening,</i>
<i>and he's emerging.</i>

54:19.992 --> 54:25.163
<i>This is truly an historic</i>
<i>moment in American history.</i>

54:30.736 --> 54:33.905
<i>Welcome home, Major!</i>

54:33.939 --> 54:35.640
<i>Good to be home, Colonel.</i>

54:38.244 --> 54:40.178
<i>How do you feel, Major?</i>

54:40.212 --> 54:41.546
<i>Good. Grateful.</i>

54:41.580 --> 54:43.882
<i>What did you learn</i>
<i>up there in space?</i>

54:43.916 --> 54:46.518
<i>Man can go anywhere.</i>

54:46.552 --> 54:50.788
<i>He just has to take his own</i>
<i>atmosphere with him.</i>

54:52.291 --> 54:54.993
I can't wait till Ethan
comes back so we can tell him.

55:03.669 --> 55:07.872
You ready to call
your husband now, Mrs. Masters?

55:07.907 --> 55:10.975
Soon.
In a little while.

55:56.789 --> 55:58.923
You put my name on the study.

56:01.393 --> 56:02.860
You earned it.

56:08.067 --> 56:10.501
No one believes in the work.

56:10.536 --> 56:13.004
Scully, maybe.

56:15.207 --> 56:16.507
No one else.

56:18.310 --> 56:19.844
I do.

56:23.616 --> 56:25.149
So do you.

56:25.184 --> 56:30.221
But it doesn't matter.

56:30.255 --> 56:32.423
Because...

56:37.663 --> 56:40.064
it's over.

56:47.673 --> 56:49.040
So, uh...

56:53.779 --> 56:55.613
I have nothing to offer you.

57:00.085 --> 57:01.352
That's all right.

57:01.387 --> 57:05.156
Except, maybe...

57:05.190 --> 57:08.593
the truth.

57:14.433 --> 57:19.303
I finally realized that, uh...

57:19.338 --> 57:22.140
there is one thing
I-I can't live without.

57:25.678 --> 57:28.946
It's you.

57:36.989 --> 57:39.490
You.
