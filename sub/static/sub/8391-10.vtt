00:00.820 --> 00:01.787

ASKED ME

00:01.820 --> 00:03.139
TO COME HERE
AND SPICE IT UP,

00:03.170 --> 00:04.398
AND THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO DO.

00:04.450 --> 00:05.656
- YOU DON'T LIKE
HOW I'M DIRECTING THE PLAY,

00:05.690 --> 00:07.134
CROSBY, THAT'S FINE.

00:07.170 --> 00:07.966
YOU SPICE IT UP
HOWEVER YOU LIKE.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.241
- HAVE YOU MET
UNCLE ADAM'S BOSS?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.417
HER BOYFRIEND OR WHATEVER?

00:11.450 --> 00:12.587
- HE'S ACTUALLY OKAY.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.029
- THINK THEY'RE, LIKE,
HAVING SEX?

00:14.080 --> 00:15.479
- WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
- GORDON WANTS ME

00:15.530 --> 00:17.111
TO FIRE SEVEN PEOPLE
SO WE DON'T GO UNDER.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.664
- WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO MY ART TEACHER?

00:19.700 --> 00:22.282
- I WENT TO YOUR LITTLE
PORTUGUESE POUND CAKE

00:22.330 --> 00:25.493
AND I TOLD HIM TO STAY AWAY
FROM WHAT'S MINE.

00:25.540 --> 00:27.258
- ALL THIS TIME IN THERAPY,

00:27.300 --> 00:28.528
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED.

00:28.580 --> 00:29.808
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

00:30.890 --> 00:34.053
[alarm beeping]

00:45.110 --> 00:46.725
- DEAR GOD.

00:46.770 --> 00:48.146
- AH, THERE'S MY GIRL.

00:48.180 --> 00:49.624
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

00:49.670 --> 00:52.070
- THANKS.
THIS IS QUITE THE BA'I'I'LE ZONE.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.566
- YEAH, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR BEING MY SOUS CHEF TODAY.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.739
- WELL, I DIDN'T HAVE
MUCH OF A CHOICE.

00:56.780 --> 00:57.849
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.869
I COULD HAVE HAD
ANYBODY HELP ME.

00:58.920 --> 01:00.319
I HAD A LOT OF OFFERS.

01:00.370 --> 01:01.746
- YEAH, NOW YOU'RE
JUST BU'ITERING ME UP.

01:01.780 --> 01:03.577
- NO, IT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:03.610 --> 01:05.840
AND YOU'RE GOOD UNDER PRESSURE
AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL,

01:05.890 --> 01:07.710
YOU DO WHAT I SAY.

01:07.750 --> 01:08.785
- THERE IT IS.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.549
- IT'S GONNA BE FUN.

01:10.580 --> 01:12.093
I PROMISE.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.131
OKAY, SO NOW LET'S GO
OVER THE PLAN.

01:14.170 --> 01:16.206
THIS IS--THIS IS JUST
THE FOOD ASSIGNMENTS.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.582
HERE IS THE OVEN SCHEDULE.

01:17.620 --> 01:19.827
- THERE'S AN OVEN SCHEDULE?
- ABSOLUTELY.

01:19.870 --> 01:22.100
WE ONLY HAVE ONE OVEN.
SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SCHEDULE.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.766
SO, OKAY,
THE TURKEY JUST WENT IN.

01:24.800 --> 01:25.789
IT COMES OUT AT 11:00.

01:25.840 --> 01:29.492
THEN THE SQUASH GOES IN
AND THE SWEET POTATOES.

01:29.530 --> 01:33.910
- RENEE, I AM SO EXCITED
YOU'RE JOINING US.

01:33.950 --> 01:36.123
YOU HAVE NOT LIVED
UNTIL YOU'VE EXPERIENCED

01:36.160 --> 01:37.081
A BRAVERMAN THANKSGIVING.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.917
- WELL, THANK YOU
FOR INVITING ME, CROSBY.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.120
- IS IT GONNA BE FUN?

01:41.170 --> 01:42.364
- IT'S GONNA BE THE BEST TIME

01:42.410 --> 01:43.263
YOU EVER HAD IN YOUR LIFE.

01:43.310 --> 01:44.811
WE'RE GONNA EAT
TILL WE ALMOST THROW UP,

01:44.860 --> 01:46.168
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GET
ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD

01:46.200 --> 01:47.519
AND SMASH INTO EACH OTHER.

01:47.550 --> 01:49.165
- JABBAR, WE MIGHT NOT BE THERE
FOR THE GAME.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.586
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
- MA, COME ON.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.895
- HONEY, WE MIGHT NOT--
WE MIGHT NOT STILL BE THERE.

01:52.940 --> 01:54.510
- NO, YOU HAVE TO BE THERE
FOR THE FOOTBALL GAME.

01:54.560 --> 01:57.859
- OH, WHOA, YOU MADE PIE?

01:57.910 --> 02:00.378
- YOU SOUND
LIKE THAT'S A BAD THING.

02:00.430 --> 02:01.499
DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T LIKE PIE.

02:01.530 --> 02:02.565
- I LIKE PIE.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.522
IT'S JUST MY MOM MADE A LIST,

02:04.570 --> 02:07.778
AND I THINK YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO MAKE STUFFING.

02:07.810 --> 02:09.630
- I KNOW.
I SAW THE LIST.

02:09.680 --> 02:11.910
THERE'S THE STUFFING.
HERE'S PIE.

02:11.950 --> 02:13.702
- BUT, UM, HERE'S THE THING,

02:13.750 --> 02:18.198
MY SISTER WAS OFFICIALLY
ON PIE DUTY PER THE LIST.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.334
AND SHE GETS A LITTLE INTENSE
DURING THANKSGIVING.

02:21.380 --> 02:25.202
- CROSBY, IT'S THANKSGIVING.
THIS IS OUR FAMILY TRADITION.

02:25.240 --> 02:27.481
WE ALWAYS HAVE SWEET POTATO PIE
AND MINCEMEAT.

02:27.520 --> 02:30.694
IS THAT A PROBLEM?
- THAT IS NOT A PROBLEM.

02:30.730 --> 02:34.279
THE MORE PIES, THE MERRIER.
- [laughs]

02:34.320 --> 02:35.696
OKAY.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.799
- SNOOPY COMING DOWN
THE STREET.

02:37.840 --> 02:40.183
- OH, AND WOODSTOCK, I SEE,
IS NOT FAR BEHIND.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.733
- OKAY.
[mixer running]

02:41.780 --> 02:43.566
- MOMMY, WE CAN'T HEAR!

02:43.610 --> 02:45.362
- SORRY, SWEETHEART,
IT'S JUST ONE MORE MINUTE.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.607

02:54.340 --> 02:55.716
MOMMY, LOOK. IT'S SNOOPY.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.794
- NOT EVEN LOOKING.

02:59.830 --> 03:00.990
I'M LOOKING SWEETHEART.
- I'M HUNGRY.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.416
- I KNOW, SWEETHEART.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.247
CAN YOU GIVE ME A SECOND HERE
'CAUSE I--

03:04.280 --> 03:06.726
[gasps] OH, SYDNEY!

03:06.770 --> 03:08.385
- OH, BOY.
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.456
- NO, YOU JUST--
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.968
- YOU CAN'T DISTRACT ME
WHEN I'M WORKING.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.466
THAT WAS MY RUM RAISIN.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.422
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO.
- OKAY. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.

03:17.470 --> 03:18.562
IT'S OKAY.

03:18.610 --> 03:20.328
- UH, YOU KNOW,
WE STILL GOT THE APPLE.

03:20.370 --> 03:21.507
- MOM'S GONNA KILL ME.

03:21.540 --> 03:25.647
I'M GONNA...
- OKAY.

03:25.680 --> 03:28.888
- OKAY. YOU GUYS GO, OKAY?

03:28.930 --> 03:32.684
- YEP.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.927
- AH, THE HOLIDAYS.
LET'S GO. COME ON.

03:34.970 --> 03:38.485

03:38.520 --> 03:41.694
- HEY, ADAM,
THANKS FOR COMING IN

03:41.730 --> 03:43.004
ON THANKSGIVING.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.837
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.041
- YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON,
GORDON?

03:48.080 --> 03:50.287
- UM...

03:50.330 --> 03:54.289
I'VE DECIDED
TO SELL THE COMPANY.

03:54.330 --> 03:57.367
- OKAY, LISTEN, GORDON, I KNOW
THAT THINGS HAVE BEEN ROUGH

03:57.400 --> 03:59.436
AND YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SELLING THE COMPANY FOR--

03:59.480 --> 04:00.879
- IT'S SOLD. LAST NIGHT.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.919
- ALL RIGHT.

04:06.970 --> 04:10.064
SO YOU JUST TALKED TO THESE GUYS
AND THEN YOU JUST...

04:10.110 --> 04:11.509
SOLD THE COMPANY
IN ONE NIGHT?

04:11.560 --> 04:14.074
- OBVIOUSLY NOT.

04:14.110 --> 04:16.032
IT CLOSED LAST NIGHT.
- RIGHT. RIGHT.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.423
BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN
IN THE WORKS FOR MONTHS.

04:18.460 --> 04:20.041
THAT'S WHY YOU HAD ME FIRE
THOSE SEVEN PEOPLE

04:20.080 --> 04:21.877
TO MAKE THE COMPANY
MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR A SALE.

04:21.910 --> 04:23.138
- IT'S MY COMPANY.
- YEAH, IT IS YOUR COMPANY.

04:23.190 --> 04:25.738
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'VE BEEN
WORKING HERE FOR 15 YEARS--

04:25.780 --> 04:27.088
FOR OVER 15 YEARS.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.327
AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T
HAVE A STAKE IN THE COMPANY,

04:29.370 --> 04:31.429
WHICH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
MY MISTAKE YEARS AGO,

04:31.470 --> 04:33.358
BUT I WOULD THINK
THAT I WOULD AT LEAST

04:33.410 --> 04:34.638
BE IN THE LOOP ON SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.329
- WELL, THAT'S NOT HOW
IT WORKED OUT.

04:36.370 --> 04:38.338
- DID YOU TELLNAÃ©NYBODY ELSE?

04:38.380 --> 04:40.371
- TELL SARAH?
- NOBODY.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.992
IT'S TOTALLY CONFIDENTIAL
UNTIL THE DEAL'S ANNOUNCED.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.655
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO GET OUT
ON THE STREET

04:44.690 --> 04:46.317
AND HAVE YOU FIND OUT
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

04:46.350 --> 04:47.271
I WANTED YOU TO HEAR IT
FROM ME.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.527
I FIGURED THAT I AT LEAST
OWED YOU THAT.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.381
AND I ALSO DIDN'T
WANT IT TO BE, YOU KNOW,

04:52.430 --> 04:54.421
AWIQNARD LATER.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.668
- LATER?

05:06.650 --> 05:08.811
YEAH. SARAH INVITED ME OVER
FOR THANKSGIVING.

05:08.860 --> 05:09.986
SHE TOLD ME SHE WAS GOING
TO TELL YOU.

05:10.030 --> 05:12.066
- NO, SHE DIDN'T TELL ME.
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.374
- WELL, I WAS INVITED.

05:13.410 --> 05:15.970
- SO, UH, IF THAT'S IT...

05:16.000 --> 05:20.516
- LISTEN, I'M REALLY HOPING
THAT WE CAN STILL BE FRIENDS.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.111
- HEY, GORDON,
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT

05:33.160 --> 05:34.707
IF YOU WOULDN'T COME

05:34.740 --> 05:37.117

05:42.820 --> 05:44.788

05:44.820 --> 05:46.469
AND LET THEM KNOW
THE COMPANY'S BEEN SOLD,

05:46.510 --> 05:48.375
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HANDLE THAT.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.263
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:49.310 --> 05:50.857
- SO I WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE MY HOLIDAY

05:50.900 --> 05:54.131
WITH MY FAMILY.

05:54.180 --> 05:57.764
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

05:57.800 --> 06:00.451

11:49.530 --> 11:52.840
WE CAN'T SEAT ADAM AND GORDON
NEXT TO EACH OTHER

BECAUSE THEY WILL BORE
EVERYONE

11:54.160 --> 11:56.390
WITH THEIR TALK OF,
YOU KNOW, WORK AND ME.

11:56.430 --> 11:57.943

ACROSS FROM JOEL

11:57.990 --> 12:00.845
BECAUSE HE THINKS
I STOLE THE PLAY FROM HIM.

12:00.890 --> 12:03.814

12:04.750 --> 12:06.479
I CAN'T SIT HER

12:06.510 --> 12:09.308
- WE NEED MORE--
- OOH. KRISTINA.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.137
- OH, SHE COULD SIT ANYWHERE.

12:11.170 --> 12:12.137
SHE'S SWITZERLAND.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.137
- YEAH, CAN WE CLONE HER

12:13.180 --> 12:14.932
AND SIT HER NEXT
TO ALL THE DIFFICULT PEOPLE?

12:14.970 --> 12:16.107
- WOW,
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

12:16.140 --> 12:17.459

12:17.490 --> 12:19.287
- NOTHING.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.379
YOU GUYS ARE BUSTED.
I'M GOING TO TELL MOM.

12:21.430 --> 12:23.569

NAME'S SPELLED RIGHT.

12:23.600 --> 12:26.148

12:26.190 --> 12:29.398
OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU,
GORDON'S COMING TO THANKSGIVING.

12:29.430 --> 12:31.773
- YEAH, SARAH, I DON'T THINK
HE'S COMING.

12:31.820 --> 12:33.014

LAST NIGHT.

12:33.060 --> 12:34.846
I JUST FORGOT TO TELL YOU.
SORRY.

12:34.890 --> 12:38.291

MORE RECENTLY AND I...

12:38.340 --> 12:39.819
ASKED HIM NOT TO_COME.
[car pulls up outSIde]

12:39.860 --> 12:41.509
- OH, ADAM,
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

12:41.550 --> 12:42.756
- THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY
INTENSE AT WORK

12:42.790 --> 12:44.894
AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
MY THANKSGIVING WITH THE GUY.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.101
- IT'S NOT YOUR THANKSGIVING.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.277
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
HE'S MY DATE.

12:47.310 --> 12:49.244
CAN'T YOU PUT THAT--
- GOD, HERE WE GO.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.168
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

12:51.210 --> 12:53.838
IT'S A PORSCHE PANAMERA S.
ARE YOU SEEING THIS, GUYS?

12:53.870 --> 12:57.909
- HMM. IN A PORSCHE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT COULD BE.

12:57.940 --> 12:59.419
- WELL, IT'S NOT MY PORSCHE.
- IT'S NOT?

12:59.460 --> 13:02.429
- NO.
- I WONDER WHOSE IT IS.

13:02.470 --> 13:03.869
- BOY, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.148
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE HOPING

13:05.190 --> 13:08.432
IT IS HIM OR NOT HIM.

13:22.490 --> 13:23.514
- MY MOTHER CAN BE TOUGH.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.869
BUT FLATTERY
WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERE.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.527
TELL HER YOU LIKE
HER GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE

13:27.560 --> 13:28.527
AND YOU'LL BE IN.

13:28.560 --> 13:29.527
- GOT IT.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.527
- HEY, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH ADAM?

13:30.560 --> 13:32.835
HE TOLD ME THIS MORNING
YOU WEREN'T COMING.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.259
I WAS WORRIED.
- IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.872
I'M HERE, RIGHT.
- YES, YOU ARE.

13:38.920 --> 13:42.253
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE HERE.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.745
- ALL RIGHT, BUT, YOU KNOW,

13:45.790 --> 13:47.269
IT'S NICE TO SARAH
TO NOT BE ALONE

13:47.300 --> 13:48.301
FOR ONCE ON THE HOLIDAYS.

13:48.340 --> 13:49.568
YOU GOT TO THINK
ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

13:49.620 --> 13:50.928
- YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.166
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF
GOING ON AT WORK

13:52.210 --> 13:53.370
I DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT.

13:53.410 --> 13:54.547
AND NOW, I JUST DON'T
WANT HIM HERE.

13:54.590 --> 13:57.309
HEY, I GOT THIS FOR YOU.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.863
- YOU GOT ME SPARKLING CIDER?
- YEAH.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.936
YOU GUYS ARE STILL
TRYING TO HAVE A BABY, RIGHT?

14:00.970 --> 14:02.551
- YES, THANK YOU.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.624
- IT'S NOT A BRAVERMAN
THANKSGIVING

14:03.670 --> 14:05.001
WITHOUT A LITTLE WINE.

14:05.050 --> 14:06.449
GONNA BE A RED WINE
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.660
- THANK YOU, I HOPE.
- MORE SCOTCH.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.564
YOUR BROTHER'S AN IDIOT.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.760
- CUT THE GUY SOME SLACK,
WOULD YOU?

14:09.810 --> 14:12.085
HE'S JUST TRYING TO IMPRESS
HIS FUTURE BROTHER-IN-LAW.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.678
- AND, ACTUALLY, I THINK
THIS IS ABOUT THE QUEST

14:13.710 --> 14:14.677
FOR THE KINDERGARTEN PLAY.

14:14.710 --> 14:16.052
IT'S KIND OF A BATTLE ROYALE.

14:16.090 --> 14:17.318
- REALLY?
- THE KINDERGARTEN PLAY.

14:17.370 --> 14:18.883
- YOU HAVE A LITTLE TIFF
WITH CROS?

14:18.920 --> 14:21.024
- YEAH, BABY THINKS THAT
CROSBY'S STOLEN IT FROM HIM.

14:21.060 --> 14:23.199
- OH, DRAMA. BABY THINKS
THAT CROSBY STOLEN IT FROM HIM.

14:23.240 --> 14:24.400
- THANK YOU, HONEY.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.169
THAT DIDN'T MAKE ME
SOUND PETTY AT ALL.

14:26.210 --> 14:27.586
- TELL YOU WHAT, YOU GUYS
CAN SETTLE THIS

14:27.620 --> 14:29.656
ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD,
ALL RIGHT? HADDIE, COME HERE!

14:29.690 --> 14:30.486
IT'S TIME FOR US TO COME UP

14:30.520 --> 14:31.896
WITH SOME
OF THOSE TRICK PLAYS.

14:31.940 --> 14:33.009
- STATUE OF LIBERTY PLAY.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.689
- I'M GONNA MAKE A ROUND.
I'M GONNA MAKE A ROUND.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.938
- BOY, DADDY'S LITTLE TOMBOY
HAS JUST GROWN UP SO FAST.

14:37.980 --> 14:40.312
- ALL RIGHT, SAVE IT
FOR THE THEATER, SONDHEIM.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.907
- HEY, WOULD YOU SLOW DOWN?

14:41.950 --> 14:43.497
YOU'RE NOT EVEN LISTENING
TO ME.

14:43.530 --> 14:46.181
- NO, I AM LISTENING, CROSBY,
I MEAN, GOOD GOD.

14:46.230 --> 14:47.322
THANK YOU.

14:47.360 --> 14:50.079
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I LOVE YOU.

14:50.130 --> 14:51.574
YOU'RE MY SON.

14:51.610 --> 14:54.295
AND I WOULD GIVE YOU MY KIDNEY
IF I COULD.

14:54.340 --> 14:57.025
BUT YOU'RE NOT CARVING
THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.199
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M DEALING
WITH RIGHT NOW?

14:59.240 --> 15:01.708
RENEE THINKS I'M SOME
IRRESPONSIBLE KID.

15:01.760 --> 15:05.992
AND I--LISTEN, DAD, I GOTTA BE
THE MAN OF THE HOUSE.

15:06.040 --> 15:06.859

15:09.080 --> 15:11.173
- I'M SORRY, WHAT?

15:11.220 --> 15:13.450
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

15:13.490 --> 15:16.493
- SON, A MAN HAS
A CERTAIN RELATIONSHIP

15:16.530 --> 15:18.145
WITH HIS THANKSGIVING BIRD.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.943
OKAY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO CALL IT EXACTLY.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.675
AND PLUS I PAID
FOR THE DAMN THING,

15:22.710 --> 15:23.677
SO I'M CARVING IT.

15:23.710 --> 15:28.022
- WHOA, HEY, HEY, DAD,
I WILL REIMBURSE YOU

15:28.060 --> 15:32.429
FOR THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP
YOU HAVE WITH YOUR BIRD.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.755
WHAT ARE THEY, LIKE,
$0.80 A POUND OR SOMETHING?

15:34.790 --> 15:35.996
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

15:36.030 --> 15:37.964
- HOW DEEP ARE YOU
INTO THIS BIRD?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.481
- OH, GOSH,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.966
REALLY? I MEAN, YOU REALLY
WANT TO DO IT?

15:44.010 --> 15:46.979

BUT I--YEAH.

15:47.010 --> 15:51.071

YOU CAN CARVE MY BIRD.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.769

15:56.810 --> 15:59.779
AND, UM, RENEE'S GONNA WANT
TO HEAR SOME KIND OF A PRAYER

15:59.820 --> 16:01.435
BEFORE DINNER STARTS.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.779
SOMETHING RELIGIOUS
OR OLD TESTAMENT.

16:03.820 --> 16:05.572
I DON'T KNOW. SOMETHING.

16:05.610 --> 16:10.400
JUST A HEADS UP.

16:10.450 --> 16:12.065

I'M JUST GOING TO POP THIS IN

16:24.770 --> 16:25.623

ABOUT YOU.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.558
THERE'S AN OVEN SCHEDULE,
MY FRIEND.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.028
AND WHY CAN'T I HAVE ONE
IF MAX IS HAVING ONE?

16:43.070 --> 16:44.264
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT MAX IS DOING.

16:44.310 --> 16:47.131
- IT'S NOT FAIR.
I WANT A SQUEEZER.

16:57.360 --> 17:02.047

17:52.890 --> 17:53.891
OH, THANKS.

17:53.930 --> 17:58.299
SO...I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

17:58.350 --> 18:00.443

YOU WOULD.

18:00.490 --> 18:03.345
- I JUST HOPE THAT YOU MADE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

18:03.390 --> 18:06.143

- NO. I DON'T LIKE SHARING.
- MAX.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.913
- IT'S NOT FUN.
- SHARE WITH THE YOUNGER KIDS.

18:18.950 --> 18:21.225
- NO, I'M NOT SHARING.
- SORRY.

18:21.270 --> 18:24.194
- GENTLEMEN, LADIES, I'VE BEEN
ASKED TO INVITE YOU IN.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.128
- WHAT IS THIS I HEAR
ABOUT YOU CARVING UP

18:26.170 --> 18:27.683
THE THANKSGIVING DAY TURKEY?

18:32.180 --> 18:34.489
- YES. WELL, IN THE EVENT
THAT THE PATRIARCH

18:34.520 --> 18:35.828
CAN'T PERFORM
HIS CARVING DUTY,

18:35.870 --> 18:37.519
I'M PRETTY SURE
THAT FALLS TO THE ELDEST SON,

18:37.560 --> 18:38.868
WHICH WOULD BE ME.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.140
- MM-HMM.
THANKS FOR THE HIERARCHY LESSON.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.181
- IT'S, LIKE, LAW.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.256
- IF WE WERE HAVING THIS DINNER
IN THE 13005,

18:44.290 --> 18:45.769
YEAH, THAT WOULD PROBABLY
MAKE SENSE.

18:45.810 --> 18:46.879
- YOU'RE MESSING
WITH THE UNIVERSE.

18:46.910 --> 18:49.253
- CROSBY TAKING OVER SOMETHING.
THAT IS SHOCKING.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.915
- YEAH.

18:50.950 --> 18:53.635
OH, COME ON, GOOSE, I ASKED YOU
TO CALL EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.955
- YEAH, I'M TRYING, OKAY?
THEY'RE NOT LISTENING.

18:55.990 --> 18:58.857
- HAVE YOU SEEN YOUR DAD?
CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

18:58.890 --> 19:00.642
- SHE ASKED YOU TO CALL
EVERYBODY TO DINNER.

19:00.690 --> 19:01.827
WOULD YOU DO THAT, PLEASE?

19:01.860 --> 19:03.168
YOU ARE SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT
TO HER.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.859
- YOU PUT ME
IN A BAD POSITION.

19:04.900 --> 19:09.690
- SERIOUSLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HER FAVORITE.

19:09.730 --> 19:12.619
- HEY.

19:12.660 --> 19:14.628

19:14.670 --> 19:16.626
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO USE
YOUR COMPUTER

19:16.670 --> 19:18.809
'CAUSE I GOTTA FIND
A PRAYER.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.284
IS THAT OKAY?
- YEAH.

19:24.990 --> 19:27.982
SO WHO ARE YOU AVOIDING?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:28.020 --> 19:30.261
- EVERYBODY'S DOWNSTAIRS
HAVING FUN AND HERE YOU ARE

19:30.300 --> 19:32.234
MR. SOLITARY.

19:32.270 --> 19:35.262

19:38.000 --> 19:39.991
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S WEIRD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.109
HE SEEMS LIKE A NICE GUY.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.313
I MEAN, YOU WANT YOUR MOM
TO BE HAPPY, DON'T YOU?

19:43.350 --> 19:45.511

19:51.740 --> 19:53.321
IT'S THANKSGIVING, YOU KNOW.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.349
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE
ABOUT FAMILY,

19:54.400 --> 19:56.709
NOT WHO SHE'S DATING.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.329
- HMM.

20:07.270 --> 20:10.239
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR DAD?

20:10.270 --> 20:11.953
- I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

20:19.800 --> 20:23.281
- GOSH, DREW, YOU KNOW,
YOUR DAD, SETH,

20:23.320 --> 20:26.619
HE GETS A BAD RAP AROUND
THIS HOUSE A LOT, YOU KNOW.

20:26.670 --> 20:29.355
AND I--I'M THE WORST OFFENDER.

20:29.400 --> 20:32.426
I'M--I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW?
I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

20:32.470 --> 20:34.700

AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO MISS HIM

20:38.610 --> 20:41.579
AND YOU HAVE A RIGHT
TO LOVE HIM.

20:41.610 --> 20:43.749
THERE'S NO SHAME IN THAT.

20:43.790 --> 20:46.065
YOU KNOW, GRANDSON,
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

20:46.100 --> 20:50.378
YOU ARE AN EXTRAORDINARY

THAT'S JUST TRULY REMARKABLE

20:54.700 --> 20:58.693

ANOTHER CALL?

25:47.400 --> 25:49.152

26:01.240 --> 26:02.343

26:02.380 --> 26:04.689
I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES
INTO MAKING A MINCEMEAT PIE,

26:04.730 --> 26:07.278
BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS.
DELICIOUS, CAMILLE.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.936

THE MINCEMEAT PIE.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.631
AND THE SWEET POTATO TOO.

26:12.670 --> 26:14.638
I THOUGHT IT WAS PUMPKIN.

26:14.670 --> 26:17.230

SOME OF YOUR RUM RAISIN.

26:17.260 --> 26:18.295
IT'S GOT BOOZE IN IT,

26:18.330 --> 26:20.389
- OH, CROS, IT DOES,
BUT DON'T--DON'T DO THAT.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.954
SPARE YOURSELF.
IT'S A DISASTER.

26:22.990 --> 26:24.082
- NO, IT'S NOT, JULIA.

26:24.130 --> 26:25.984
I GOT SOME.
IT'S VERY GOOD, HONEY.

26:26.030 --> 26:29.329
- WELL, RUM RAISIN IS REALLY
A VERY AMBITIOUS CHOICE.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.099
YOU KNOW, I'M AMAZED
THAT YOU EVEN ATTEMPTED IT.

26:32.140 --> 26:35.348
- YEAH. OH, AMBER, HEY,
DAD WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.

26:35.380 --> 26:38.099
- OKAY, WELL, YOU CAN TELL HIM
I'LL CALL HIM BACK.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.347

26:40.390 --> 26:43.109
- I SAID THAT
I'D CALL HIM BACK, OKAY?

26:43.150 --> 26:45.698
- HEY, YEAH, SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

26:45.740 --> 26:48.834
- MOMMY, CAN I HAVE OREOS?

26:51.230 --> 26:52.982
JUST--LET'S NOT WORRY
ABOUT WHAT MAX IS DOING.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.396
- WHY CAN'T I HAVE OREOS?

26:54.440 --> 26:55.566
- SWEETIE,
BECAUSE I SAID NO

26:55.610 --> 26:58.124
AND BECAUSE WE WORKED
REALLY HARD MAKING THESE PIES.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.981
- JULIA...
- MOM, LEAVE ME ALONE, PLEASE.

27:01.030 --> 27:06.138
JUST--SYD, IF YOU WANT DESSERT,
YOU'RE HAVING PIE, OKAY?

27:06.170 --> 27:07.444
THAT'S ALL.

27:16.080 --> 27:17.763
I'M VOLUNTEERING.
- DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.244
- I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

27:19.290 --> 27:20.734
IT'S FINE.
- WHAT ABOUT THE FOOTBALL GAME?

27:20.770 --> 27:21.998
THE SECRET WEAPON.
- IT'S FINE.

27:22.050 --> 27:23.278
I'M JUST GOING TO MISS IT
THIS YEAR.

27:23.330 --> 27:24.774
I MEAN, I'M GOING
TO HELP CHARITY.

27:24.810 --> 27:25.879
AND AMBER'S NOT EVEN PLAYING.

27:25.920 --> 27:26.944

27:26.990 --> 27:27.979
SINCE 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

27:28.020 --> 27:29.328
DON'T YOU THINK
I DESERVE A BREAK?

27:29.370 --> 27:30.462
- OKAY, HOLD ON A SECOND.

27:30.510 --> 27:32.740
YOU ARE NOT LEAVING THE FAMILY
THANKSGIVING DINNER.

27:32.780 --> 27:34.259

27:34.300 --> 27:36.097
THANKSGIVING
IS THE BUSIEST DAY OF THE YEAR

27:36.130 --> 27:38.269
AT THE FOOD BANK.

27:38.310 --> 27:40.062

GOING TO GET UP

27:40.100 --> 27:41.408
IN THE MIDDLE

27:41.450 --> 27:42.781
AND GIVE YOU A RIDE
INTO OAKLAND, OKAY?

27:42.830 --> 27:44.138

27:44.170 --> 27:45.865
I'M TAKING THE BUS
AND IT LEAVES IN SEVEN MINUTES.

27:45.900 --> 27:47.697

27:53.530 --> 27:54.929
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
THE BUS HOME LATE.

27:54.980 --> 27:56.072
- OKAY.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.769
- I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
GOSH DARN IT.

27:57.810 --> 27:59.846
- I THINK THAT'LL BE MY CUE
AS WELL.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.768
I, UM, TOLD A FRIEND
I WOULD STOP BY FOR DESSERT

28:01.810 --> 28:02.947
ON THE WAY HOME.

28:02.990 --> 28:05.709
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THE FOOTBALL
REALLY IS THE BEST PART.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.297
- YOU KNOW, I PROMISED A FRIEND
I'D STOP IN.

28:07.340 --> 28:09.262

28:14.520 --> 28:15.896
- ALL RIGHT, DAD, COME ON.

28:15.930 --> 28:17.989

28:18.040 --> 28:20.486
ST. MARK'S LIONS. CLASS OF '83.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.341
- REALLY? 'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU PLAYED FOOTBALL.

28:23.390 --> 28:24.482
- YOU NEVER ASKED.

28:24.530 --> 28:27.249
- YOU DON'T LOOK
LIKE A LINEBACKER.

28:27.290 --> 28:30.111
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?
- I'VE PLAYED A LITTLE FOOTBALL.

28:30.150 --> 28:32.118
- OKAY, SO I'M LIKING THIS.

28:32.150 --> 28:33.845
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS OUT
TO THE FIELD ITSELF

28:33.880 --> 28:36.496
AND THEN, UH, HAVE SOME FUN.

28:36.540 --> 28:38.087
I'M LIKING THIS.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.938
HE'S ON TOUR.
HE'S ON THE ROAD.

29:00.980 --> 29:05.349

A HOLIDAY, HUH?

29:05.390 --> 29:08.109

29:14.130 --> 29:15.574
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET ME TO SAY.

29:15.610 --> 29:17.191
- I'M NOT TRYING
TO GET YOU TO DO ANYTHING.

29:17.230 --> 29:18.879
- I DIDN'T TELL HIM
ABOUT GORDON OR ANYTHING

29:18.920 --> 29:20.023
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO IMPLY.

29:20.060 --> 29:21.266
- IT'S NOT WHAT I'M TRYING
TO IMPLY.

29:21.310 --> 29:22.538
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
IN A WHILE

29:22.580 --> 29:24.992

ZEEK IS COMPLETELY OFF LIMITS.

29:45.610 --> 29:47.919
YOU CANNOT TOUCH HIM.
HE'S NEUTRAL, OKAY?

JASMINE'S A DANCER

30:02.620 --> 30:03.962
AND SHE'S ATHLETIC.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.513

33:15.400 --> 33:16.776
- WHY WOULDN'T YOU TELL
ANYBODY?

33:16.820 --> 33:17.912
- I DIDN'T WANT
TO WORRY ANYBODY

33:17.960 --> 33:21.054
BECAUSE THESE TYPES OF DEALS
FALL APART ALL THE TIME.

33:21.100 --> 33:23.022
- NOT EVEN ADAM?
NOT EVEN ME?

33:23.070 --> 33:24.298
- ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR JOB?

33:24.340 --> 33:26.513
'CAUSE I CAN GET YOU 100 MORE
JUST LIKE IT IN A HEARTBEAT.

33:26.550 --> 33:28.689

33:28.730 --> 33:31.449
HE HELPED ME.

33:31.490 --> 33:35.483
- I KNOW HE DID.

33:35.530 --> 33:39.045
- I JUST FEEL LIKE
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.115
- THE TRUTH IS IS THAT THIS

33:40.150 --> 33:42.072
IS SOMETHING I HAVE
THOUGHT ABOUT FOR A WHILE.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.326
IT'S--IT'S BUSINESS,

33:43.360 --> 33:45.282
AND IT'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEEDED TO DO,

33:45.330 --> 33:49.118
AND YOUR BROTHER, HE'S ALWAYS
GONNA LAND ON HIS FEET.

33:49.160 --> 33:54.097
- WE'LL...MISS YOU.

33:54.130 --> 33:55.859

TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT.

33:55.890 --> 33:57.573
I CARE ABOUT YOU, OKAY?

33:57.620 --> 33:59.713
AND I NEED TO GO AWAY
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.614
I NEED TO RETHINK THINGS
AND TRAVEL

34:01.660 --> 34:03.469
AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S NEXT FOR ME,

34:03.520 --> 34:06.512
BUT I REALLY DO WANT US
TO STAY CONNECTED.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.312
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU
COULD MEET ME ON THE ROAD

34:08.350 --> 34:11.103
AND WE COULD CONTINUE
TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

34:11.150 --> 34:14.802
- I--I CAN'T DO THAT.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.768
- I UNDERSTAND.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.745

TO YOUR HOME ON THANKSGIVING.

I DON'T KNOW. I JUST SHOULDN'T
BE TAKING IT OUT ON ALL OF YOU.

35:16.320 --> 35:17.890
- WELL, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.317
THE HOLIDAYS ARE NOTHING
IF NOT STRESSFUL.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.523
- I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO HAVING THIS DAY WITH HER

35:22.560 --> 35:23.936
WITHOUT MY CELL PHONE
AND EVERYTHING,

35:23.980 --> 35:26.210
AND I JUST--I BLEW IT,
'CAUSE MY MIND

35:26.260 --> 35:28.251
WAS ON THOSE STUPID PIES,

35:28.290 --> 35:30.463
TRYING TO GET THEM PERFECT,

35:30.500 --> 35:35.574
WHICH I OBVIOUSLY DID NOT DO.

35:35.610 --> 35:39.432
- THE PIES WERE FINE.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.233
- LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.272

TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.749
BUT YOU SET THE BAR
PRETTY HIGH.

35:51.280 --> 35:54.408
JUST--I KNOW YOU THINK
I SPOIL HER.

35:54.460 --> 35:57.213
BUT, YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU WORK ALL DAY,

35:57.250 --> 36:01.869
YOU COME HOME, YOU WANT THINGS
TO BE JUST GOOD AND HAPPY,

36:01.910 --> 36:05.778
AND HAVE IT BE RIGHT.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.539
I WANT TO HAVE IT BE ALL...

ABOUT FIGHTS.
