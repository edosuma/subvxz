WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:02.000
So, you ever
been here before?

00:02.500 --> 00:03.300
No.

00:03.400 --> 00:05.400
Oh, I don't mean <i>here</i>
here. I mean Baltimore.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.200
Yeah, I've given
several lectures

00:07.300 --> 00:08.900
to the Baltimore
Homicide Division.

00:10.900 --> 00:11.700
What's wrong
with your mouth?

00:11.800 --> 00:14.100
I got a tooth situation.
Well, go to
a dentist.

00:14.200 --> 00:16.100
All right, I will
if it doesn't get any better.

00:16.300 --> 00:18.200
Ow! Man!
Are you afraid
of the dentist?

00:18.300 --> 00:19.600
I'm not afraid.
Welcome to Balmer.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.900
This is, uh, actually a federal
flood abatement project,

00:22.000 --> 00:23.200
which is why
we called you.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.800
K-9 unit was using
it for an exercise,

00:24.900 --> 00:26.600
and one of the
cadaver dogs
went berserk.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.300
When they dug
up the cement...

00:29.000 --> 00:30.000
No, that's concrete.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.100
Cement is an ingredient in concrete.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.800
Yeah, that's a real
important distinction to make

00:34.900 --> 00:35.900
at this juncture.

00:36.300 --> 00:37.900
So, what do we got,
Bones, huh?

00:38.000 --> 00:38.800
Do your thing.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.100
Nothing.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.300
Nothing. Nothing?
No, I can't
see enough

00:42.400 --> 00:45.000
of the skull, the tibia,
the pubis.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.900
Nothing.
Nothing.
Wait a second. Nothing.

00:48.000 --> 00:48.799
Oh, sorry about that.

00:48.800 --> 00:51.700
We drove all the way here so
you could just tell me nothing?

00:52.300 --> 00:53.800
All right, so what do you,
what do you want to, uh,

00:53.900 --> 00:56.400
get the whole slab
of cement...
Concrete.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.800
...concrete, whatever-- shipped
back to the Jeffersonian?

00:59.200 --> 01:00.600
Abso ???

01:01.800 --> 01:02.800
Sex?

01:02.900 --> 01:04.800
The mandible
suggests male,

01:04.900 --> 01:05.900
and the tibia
suggests

01:06.000 --> 01:08.200
he was between five
six and six feet tall.

01:08.300 --> 01:10.600
Waffle-soled training shoes
and a track suit.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.800
You know who wears
track suits?
Athletes?

01:12.900 --> 01:15.100
No. Huge tubs of lard
or retired people.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.900
And rap stars.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.200
The teeth suggest
early middle age.

01:19.300 --> 01:20.800
So not a retiree.

01:20.900 --> 01:23.100
Uh, calcified holes
with radial fractures

01:23.200 --> 01:25.500
in the left clavicle
and scapula are consistent

01:25.600 --> 01:26.800
with ballistic damage.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.600
He was shot
to death?
And stabbed.

01:29.800 --> 01:30.900
But neither killed him.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.300
The wounds healed.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.900
Shot, stabbed,
but lived to die another day?

01:35.500 --> 01:36.300
Rap star.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.000
There is a small hole
in the back of the cranium.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.300
Get the skull out first,
establish cause of death,

01:42.400 --> 01:44.600
then give Angela something
to work with to ID the guy.

01:45.800 --> 01:46.700
Where is Angela?

01:50.700 --> 01:54.000
I'm really not good
at this kind of thing.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.300
You know, I don't...

01:56.600 --> 01:58.000
I don't get
the significance.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.800
One year ago today,

02:01.600 --> 02:02.800
you buried your mother.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.300
You laid
her to rest.

02:07.500 --> 02:08.500
Here.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.200
You're marking
the anniversary.

02:16.500 --> 02:19.200
Angela, I simply
don't believe

02:19.300 --> 02:21.700
my mother retained sentience
beyond death.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.900
Well, part of you is made
up of your mother, right?

02:25.900 --> 02:27.300
In a manner of speaking.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.500
So, honor that
part of yourself.

02:32.200 --> 02:34.200
Visualize a
memory of her.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.000
See what it brings up.

02:37.200 --> 02:40.300
I have very few
distinct memories of my mother.

02:44.800 --> 02:46.000
I'll wait in the car.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.600 --> 03:04.500
Hiya, honey.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.000
I was hoping you
might show up.

03:11.100 --> 03:12.800
I don't... I don't want
to talk to you.

03:14.400 --> 03:15.600
We're standing here

03:16.700 --> 03:18.300
in front of your
mother's grave.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.500
Obviously, you've come
for some kind of answer.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.400
Maybe I can... provide 'em.

03:29.200 --> 03:30.200
You're a killer.

03:30.700 --> 03:31.800
You burn people.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.000
Yeah, I'd like to report
a sighting of Max Keenan

03:35.100 --> 03:37.300
at Eternal Spring
Memorial Gardens.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.200
He's a wanted
fugitive.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.900
I love you.

03:48.500 --> 03:49.800
Yes, I'm sure.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.200
Because he's my father.

03:59.100 --> 04:08.100
 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@MAOREN
Sync:FRM@ºãÐÇ</font>

04:29.700 --> 04:32.000
 ??? your dad at
all before you called the cops?

04:32.500 --> 04:33.800
No. Why would I?

04:33.900 --> 04:35.500
Well, I mean, I
haven't seen my
dad in a long time,

04:35.600 --> 04:38.400
and if I had
the opportunity
to talk... Ow!

04:38.800 --> 04:39.900
Go to a
dentist.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.900
Oh, I will
if it doesn't
get any better.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.100
Based on decomposition
of the track suit,

04:44.200 --> 04:47.300
Hodgins is estimating
a postmortem interval
of two years.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.400
Based on bone deterioration,
I like three years.

04:50.500 --> 04:51.400
Well, what
killed him?

04:51.700 --> 04:53.800
The victim was dead
shortly after

04:53.900 --> 04:56.100
this hole was punched
into his skull.

04:56.200 --> 04:57.600
Too small for a projectile.

04:59.300 --> 05:00.900
No radiating stress lines.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.600
A slow entry, a piercing wound.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.200
Like a-a
screwdriver?

05:05.500 --> 05:06.700
Nail gun?
Ice pick?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.300
Yeah, something
along those lines.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.300
Oh. Cold steel to the brain--
would that kill him?

05:11.800 --> 05:12.800
Depending how far
it penetrated.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.700
Yeah, it's Booth.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.100
I need, um, all murders

05:15.200 --> 05:17.900
in which a penetrating wound
to the back of the head figured.

05:21.700 --> 05:22.700
Great. Thanks.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.000
Don't freak out.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.100
Oh!

05:32.900 --> 05:34.700
You broke
into my house?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.800
That is not
acceptable.

05:36.900 --> 05:37.800
This, uh,

05:37.900 --> 05:41.300
little device here--
it jams cell phone frequencies.

05:43.900 --> 05:45.100
That is illegal.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.300
Unfortunately,
illegal

05:46.301 --> 05:47.199
is what I do best.

05:47.200 --> 05:48.200
I'm not staying.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.400
I just want you
to do something for me.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.000
I want you to take a look
at my rap sheet.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.800
Why?
Why?

05:54.900 --> 05:58.000
Because I want a chance to talk
to you-- actually talk to you--

05:58.100 --> 06:00.100
without you calling in
the 82nd Airborne.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.200
How is reading
your police record

06:01.300 --> 06:02.800
going to change my mind?

06:02.900 --> 06:03.700
Just do it.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.300
I think our victim
was killed by Ice Pick.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.800
Angela did a facial
reconstruction of Cement Head.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.400
Concrete Head, you mean.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.400
No, Cement Head--
it's got a nicer ring.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.300
So, I ran it through
IntelPlus and got a match.

06:17.900 --> 06:19.900
William Raymond "Billy Ray"

06:20.000 --> 06:21.800
McKenna.
West Virginia.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.300
"Assault, manslaughter,
kidnapping,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
torture...."
This here...

06:28.800 --> 06:30.400
This here is, uh, Hugh Kennedy.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.400
Uh, I think
he killed Cement Head.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.200
Why?

06:35.300 --> 06:36.100
Well, West Virginia,

06:36.200 --> 06:38.500
likes to use an ice pick
on his victims, plus Ice Pick

06:38.600 --> 06:40.400
and Cement Head
were both employed

06:40.500 --> 06:42.400
by a regional crime boss
in West Virginia

06:43.100 --> 06:45.100
named... Gallagher.

06:46.700 --> 06:47.900
Well, what are we going
to call him?

06:49.201 --> 06:50.099
Gallagher.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.900
But he runs
most of the, uh, prostitutes,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.900
strippers, gambling,
bootlegging, meth,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.300
extortion in West Virginia.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.100
Five years ago,
the West Virginia

07:00.200 --> 07:02.100
State Police began pressuring

07:02.200 --> 07:04.900
Gallagher's criminal operation,
making a lot of arrests.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.900
Including Ice Pick
and Cement Head.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.000
Cement Head goes to jail.

07:08.100 --> 07:10.200
Ice Pick? 
Out on bail, babe.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.800
You say that
like it means something.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.500
Oh, I talked to the officer
in charge, and he said

07:14.600 --> 07:15.900
that Ice Pick
wouldn't say anything,

07:16.000 --> 07:17.300
so they punished him
by letting him out

07:17.400 --> 07:18.300
on bail.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.000
How is bail punishment?

07:20.100 --> 07:21.400
'Cause it makes Gallagher think

07:21.500 --> 07:23.800
that Ice Pick cooperated
with the cops.

07:24.700 --> 07:26.700
You know,
it's criminal
psychology, Bones.

07:26.701 --> 07:27.599
You know, you wouldn't get it.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.600
Just read. Just continue
reading there, will you?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.800
"Half a million
dollar bond.

07:34.700 --> 07:36.400
"Kennedy jumped bail.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.100
"Killed in a car accident

07:38.200 --> 07:41.700
while fleeing
a Bail Fugitive Recovery agent."

07:41.800 --> 07:44.000
Bounty Hunter.
"Car burned the remains to ashes."

07:44.100 --> 07:45.200
All they got was a severed leg.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.600
They didn't actually get
Ice Pick's body.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.900
So, are we going to talk
to the bounty hunter?

07:50.000 --> 07:51.500
No, I am. You're gonna make sure

07:51.600 --> 07:54.400
that that severed leg
actually belonged to Ice Pick.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.800
Well, someone kept the leg?

07:55.900 --> 07:57.700
The severed leg
was frozen as evidence.

07:57.900 --> 08:01.300
So, you think
Ice Pick might still be alive?

08:01.500 --> 08:02.300
As a friend
of mine

08:02.400 --> 08:04.100
likes to say,
"Don't jump to conclusions

08:04.600 --> 08:06.600
until all the evidence is in."

08:07.100 --> 08:09.800
If the facts are in, then
it's not jumping to conclusions,

08:09.900 --> 08:10.700
so I never
said that.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.300
I never said
that the friend is you, okay?

08:25.000 --> 08:27.300
Does it have to be completely
thawed for you to examine?

08:27.400 --> 08:29.700
No. My interest lies
only in the femur.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.299
I need to get some tissue
for DNA testing.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.100
I'm the bounty hunter
you want to talk to.

08:47.200 --> 08:48.300
Veleska Miller.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.200
You want to know
about Kennedy's leg?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.700
Anything you want to tell me
outside the official report,

08:59.800 --> 09:00.600
that's great.

09:00.800 --> 09:01.600
Sure.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.800
How it smelled,
his body cooking over the fire.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.900
Otherwise,
I stand by the record.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.000
How'd you find him?

09:10.200 --> 09:11.900
Tip from someone I know
who provides documents

09:12.000 --> 09:13.100
to fugitives.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.800
Tailed him, he made me,
took off.

09:16.100 --> 09:16.900
Boom!

09:17.700 --> 09:20.000
Found his leg about 30 yards
from the vehicle.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.600
And you saw him burn?

09:22.700 --> 09:23.700
Yeah.

09:24.600 --> 09:25.600
Why?

09:29.400 --> 09:30.400
That's it?

09:31.900 --> 09:32.800
That's it.

09:34.300 --> 09:35.600
I'm a little disappointed.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.600
I was hoping
you'd keep me here a while,

09:37.700 --> 09:41.500
ask me some dumb-ass
federal questions, check me out.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.900
How's about
I buy you a nice breakfast, huh?

09:49.600 --> 09:52.400
Guy like you must be going crazy
in the FBI.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.800
What kind of guy is that,
exactly?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.400
I'm a bounty hunter, sport.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.300
I read people fast, or I die.

10:00.900 --> 10:03.500
You are not standard
government issue.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.800
Take a walk
on the wild side.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.200
I have more fun, fewer rules,

10:08.500 --> 10:09.800
and a lot of money.

10:11.700 --> 10:12.500
Yeah.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.200
You make a compelling case.

10:18.500 --> 10:19.500
Booth.

10:19.900 --> 10:20.800
Coroner's report said

10:20.900 --> 10:23.000
Kennedy's leg was severed
in the car accident.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.300
We don't call him Kennedy.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.600
We call him Ice Pick.

10:26.300 --> 10:28.400
Hold on for one second. Sorry.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.600
Yeah. Aah.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.600
Listen, I got the, uh,
bounty hunter here.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.100
She was an eyewitness
to the crash.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.300
Saw him incinerated.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.100
Tell Booth that Ice Pick's
femur is sliced cleanly

10:40.500 --> 10:41.600
at 90 degrees.

10:41.700 --> 10:42.600
I can hear you, Bones.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.300
Okay? It's a speakerphone.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.600
Look, amputation
like that could happen

10:46.700 --> 10:48.000
in a bad wreck,
right, Cam?

10:48.300 --> 10:49.200
Yes.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.200
Well, there are kerf marks.

10:51.400 --> 10:53.200
She's seeing evidence
of a saw, Booth.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.400
Look, I know
what kerf marks are.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.600
Booth should arrest
the bounty hunter.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.300
I can hear you, Bones.

10:59.400 --> 11:00.700
What am I gonna
arrest her for, huh?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.400
For lying, for perjury.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.600
For aiding in a cover-up.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.500
If she's there with you,
just detain her.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.500
Okay.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.500
 ???

11:17.200 --> 11:19.600
Hey, look at that, huh?
DNA is a match.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.800
West Virginia
state troopers

11:22.000 --> 11:24.300
got a DNA sample
at Ice Pick's arrest.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.600
This is definitely his leg.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Was she pretty?

11:27.900 --> 11:29.700
Ice Pick is a male.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.700
I mean the bounty hunter
who gave Booth the slip.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.300
You know, she didn't get away
because she was pretty.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.100
She was a <i>she?</i>
No, she was a...

11:36.200 --> 11:37.400
Oh...

11:37.800 --> 11:39.000
What's wrong with your mouth?

11:39.200 --> 11:41.200
I'm guessing the
anterior molar

11:41.300 --> 11:42.900
on the left
side is infected.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.000
The leg was
surgically amputated.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.200
Go to a dentist.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.600
He's afraid
of the dentist.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.000
These kerf marks are

11:49.100 --> 11:50.300
consistent with a type

11:50.400 --> 11:52.200
of wire saw used
to remove horns

11:52.300 --> 11:54.700
from heifers.
Ah, so...

11:54.800 --> 11:56.700
Ice Pick and this bounty
hunter set up a car accident

11:56.800 --> 11:59.300
with a dummy victim so
everyone stops looking for him.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.800
Two years later he kills
Con-- Cement Head.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.700
She hoodwinked you
'cause she was hot.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.100
All right, look, you know what?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.700
She wasn't hot.
In fact, she looked like a man.

12:08.700 --> 12:10.600
The amputation
was probably performed

12:10.700 --> 12:13.400
by a livestock veterinarian.
Hey, Bones,
I've got that other

12:13.500 --> 12:14.500
thing you want to discuss.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.000
Oh, let's...

12:16.700 --> 12:17.700
go to my office

12:17.800 --> 12:19.700
so we don't
disturb Cam.

12:20.000 --> 12:20.900
Booth?
Yeah?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.200
Livestock amputation.
That is one tough,

12:23.300 --> 12:25.500
determined old criminal.
Be careful.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.600
You know, I was going
 through your father's

12:29.700 --> 12:30.700
crim...
Shh!

12:30.900 --> 12:32.700
...criminal record and he was
right about one thing.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.600
You know, he never ended
anyone's life who didn't

12:34.700 --> 12:36.500
have it coming to them.
He's a sociopath.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.200
Well, maybe, but at
least he aimed in the
right direction.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.900
Ow!
Let me take a look
at your tooth.

12:41.000 --> 12:41.800
All right, just...

12:43.700 --> 12:45.100
Go easy. You promise?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.300
Okay.
All right.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.200
Open up.
You know,

12:49.900 --> 12:50.800
What?

12:51.300 --> 12:52.199
In the Old West,

12:52.200 --> 12:53.700
he would have been
considered a hero.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.300
Yeah, well, the Old West
Ow!

12:55.400 --> 12:57.700
was a time of chaos
and violence that,

12:57.900 --> 12:59.200
anthropologically speaking,

12:59.300 --> 13:00.500
our country is still
Ow!

13:00.700 --> 13:01.900
trying to recover from.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.700
Yeah, I was right.
Anterior molar on the left side,

13:05.300 --> 13:06.300
it's infected.

13:06.900 --> 13:07.700
You know, your
father never killed

13:07.800 --> 13:09.100
any hardworking, tax-paying

13:09.200 --> 13:10.700
citizens or honest cops.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.600
Ow!
You still think

13:12.700 --> 13:14.200
that society
should forgive him?
All I'm saying

13:14.300 --> 13:17.000
is if I have an opportunity
to arrest him, I will.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.600
But you know who maybe

13:18.800 --> 13:19.900
should forgive him?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.500
His daughter.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.400
Oh, look at that.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.300
The small town
crime boss is here.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.200
Let's go have a little chat
with him, shall we?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.700
Billy Ray McKenna shortly before

13:34.800 --> 13:36.300
he became Cement Head.

13:37.100 --> 13:38.500
I like nicknames.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.700
They are universal
mnemonic devices.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.100
Why are we doing this?
Don't we know that cause

13:43.200 --> 13:45.500
of death was brain scrambling
due to an ice pick?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.600
The technical term is "pithing."

13:47.900 --> 13:49.900
 <i>And</i> it's not how he died.

13:50.200 --> 13:52.500
It entered
the medullary

13:52.600 --> 13:54.800
pyramids, and beveling
on the entry site suggests

13:54.900 --> 13:55.900
it was...

13:57.400 --> 13:58.700
I don't believe there's
an English word that

13:58.800 --> 14:00.300
adequately describes...

14:00.400 --> 14:02.200
Wiggling. Up and down

14:02.300 --> 14:03.600
is wiggling.
Okay...

14:03.900 --> 14:06.600
wiggled, thus
paralyzing the victim

14:06.700 --> 14:08.300
and causing some
difficulty breathing.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.900
But he would live for upwards

14:10.000 --> 14:11.900
of several hours.
Smart.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.700
Very little
blood spilled.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.300
How did the victim die?

14:16.600 --> 14:17.900
This is the bad part.

14:18.700 --> 14:20.100
It appears that the concrete

14:20.200 --> 14:22.500
was poured over him
while he was still alive.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.300
Oh...

14:24.400 --> 14:26.100
These chunks of concrete

14:26.800 --> 14:28.100
are in the shape of...

14:28.800 --> 14:30.100
a sinus cavity,

14:31.100 --> 14:32.600
bronchial tubes,

14:33.200 --> 14:35.800
plus a kind of a hollow

14:36.000 --> 14:37.200
around the middle finger.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.400
You said he was paralyzed.

14:39.500 --> 14:42.400
Well, if the ice pick was
inserted and then waggled...

14:47.300 --> 14:48.900
...it would affect
the median nerve

14:49.000 --> 14:50.500
and the T1 nerve roots.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.800
Which control
the flexor carpi radialis.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.900
Anterior palm, thumb,
index and middle fingers.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.500
But if it was...

14:58.501 --> 14:59.399
Wiggled.

14:59.400 --> 15:00.800
...the victim would
lose the ability

15:00.900 --> 15:03.400
to move the ring
and pinky fingers.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.300
We think he wiggled
instead of waggled.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.500
Because he could still
move his middle finger.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.400
It's a terrible way to die.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.400
Our conclusion
is that he was trying
to swim to the surface

15:14.500 --> 15:16.100
using only
his middle finger.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.500
The last time I saw
Billy Ray McKenna

15:19.600 --> 15:22.000
he was "So long, suckering" me
from his F-150

15:22.100 --> 15:23.900
and heading off
on a well-earned vacation.

15:24.000 --> 15:25.700
Well-earned by torturing
a journalist

15:25.800 --> 15:27.200
who was talking too much.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.000
Well, I resent
your inference.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.700
Get him my, uh...

15:30.900 --> 15:32.100
whatcha call it? Tax papers,

15:32.200 --> 15:33.800
employment records.
Did I get that right?

15:33.900 --> 15:36.700
Not quite. You resent
his implication.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.200
He's implying that
you're a criminal.

15:38.300 --> 15:42.300
You're taking inference 
with hisimplication.
-Have at it.

15:44.100 --> 15:48.100
According to this, Mr. Lightner
is your flight instructor.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.300
That is correct.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.000
I have wide-ranging enterprises.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.600
Clark here is helpful
in getting me

15:54.700 --> 15:55.600
where I got to get.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.300
And William Raymond McKenna

15:58.400 --> 16:00.100
is down as a media liaison.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.300
Yep, by breaking
journalists' fingers.

16:02.400 --> 16:03.900
You know, you never
asked me about, uh,

16:04.100 --> 16:06.300
Billy Ray McKenna
there, big dog.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.800
Well, I assume,
big dog, that, uh,

16:09.900 --> 16:11.300
Billy Ray is deceased.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.300
Why?

16:12.500 --> 16:14.000
He was a valued employee.

16:14.900 --> 16:16.300
Disappears for three years,

16:16.400 --> 16:17.800
I got to assume the worst.

16:17.900 --> 16:20.200
His body was found
encased in concrete.

16:24.200 --> 16:26.600
Tell you what, we're gonna
claim his remains.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.800
We'll bury him proper.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.200
Where'd you send
him on vacation?

16:29.500 --> 16:31.200
Canada.
Canada?

16:31.300 --> 16:32.400
Was it the Mounties that

16:32.500 --> 16:34.600
found Billy Ray
encased in cement?

16:34.700 --> 16:36.100
Concrete.
Hmm?

16:36.700 --> 16:38.500
Not cement. It's a common error.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.500
Baltimore Police.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.600
Is Baltimore on the way
to Canada?
Well, the most

16:42.700 --> 16:44.900
efficient route is
up through Detroit,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.100
but Billy Ray, hell,
he loved Vermont so.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.200
Do you have any idea who might
want to kill Mr. McKenna?

16:51.900 --> 16:54.400
Oh, hell, yeah. He, uh...

16:55.300 --> 16:57.000
Well, how would you put it?
Aggressive.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.800
Yeah.
Both socially
and sexually.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.300
How about Hugh Kennedy?

17:03.100 --> 17:04.200
Hugh Kennedy.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.900
Yeah, handy with the ice pick.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.200
According to this,

17:07.300 --> 17:09.900
you hired him as a "Liquor

17:10.000 --> 17:12.800
License Consultant
on a per case basis."

17:12.900 --> 17:14.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes. I remember.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.599
Taciturn type. Very dour.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.700
Right. In jail
for murder once,

17:19.800 --> 17:21.000
manslaughter twice,

17:21.099 --> 17:24.000
and suspect in four
unsolved murders,

17:24.200 --> 17:26.599
all involving ice picks.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.600
You know, good old Hugh did not
put none of that on his résumé.

17:31.900 --> 17:33.600
If I recall, Mr. Kennedy

17:33.700 --> 17:35.500
was killed in a car accident

17:35.600 --> 17:37.400
fleeing a bail
enforcement officer.

17:37.900 --> 17:38.900
Got burned up.

17:41.100 --> 17:43.900
Well... you guys look us up

17:44.000 --> 17:45.600
if you're ever
in western West Virginia.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.900
We're at Snackie's
Roadhouse and Grill.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
Where the 119
hits the 64.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.900
I'll make a
note of that.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.600
119 hits the...

17:56.900 --> 17:58.500
64.
64.

18:08.900 --> 18:09.800
Hey, T, look.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.600
Snickerdoodles. What do...

18:12.400 --> 18:13.900
Oh, come on,
you used to love them.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.600
When you were
a little girl.

18:16.900 --> 18:18.800
I got a message for you
from your brother.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.100
What message?

18:21.400 --> 18:24.000
Uh, he says, um...
He says "hi."

18:29.100 --> 18:30.700
Have you turned Russ
into a criminal, too?

18:31.700 --> 18:33.700
Hey, I haven't
committed a crime

18:33.800 --> 18:35.300
in over 15 years.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.900
I'm straight.
Except for

18:37.200 --> 18:38.600
killing, gutting, and burning

18:38.700 --> 18:40.200
the deputy director
of the FBI.

18:40.300 --> 18:42.400
He was trying to kill Russ,
and then he was going

18:42.500 --> 18:43.600
after you. It is not

18:43.700 --> 18:45.500
a crime to protect your family.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.600
Some fathers do it
without killing.

18:52.100 --> 18:53.600
Did, uh... you and Booth

18:53.700 --> 18:55.600
take a look at my,
uh, rap sheet?

18:56.100 --> 18:57.000
Yes.

18:57.600 --> 18:58.500
And?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.200
He'll arrest you if
he has the chance.

19:01.500 --> 19:02.300
What else?

19:09.200 --> 19:10.700
So the snickerdoodles.
Come on.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.500
You don't remember?
You loved them as a little girl.

19:13.700 --> 19:14.700
I don't remember.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.400
I'd come home,
and then you'd

19:17.500 --> 19:19.700
be jumping around. You were five
or six years old and you'd say,

19:19.800 --> 19:21.300
"Come on, why don't you
put on the trying song?

19:21.400 --> 19:23.600
Put on the trying song!"
The trying song?

19:24.200 --> 19:25.000
It was my favorite song.

19:25.100 --> 19:27.500
I used to sing it.
It was, uh... by Poco.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.800
The band.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.200
Hugh Kennedy?

20:03.201 --> 20:05.200
Bad guy, but he's dead.

20:05.200 --> 20:08.100
About five years ago in a car
crash in West Virginia.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.700
Recent evidence
suggests otherwise.
How do you know him?

20:10.900 --> 20:14.600
Well, him and his ice pick were
pretty famous in some circles.

20:14.800 --> 20:15.800
I've got to go.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.100
Now?
Yeah.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.500
You speed-dialed Booth.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.700
He's been listening
to everything and the...

20:22.000 --> 20:23.600
the SWAT team's on its way.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.900
I mean, I'm
just guessing.

20:28.100 --> 20:29.700
But there is something I
do want to say to you.

20:32.700 --> 20:33.600
Mom?

20:34.300 --> 20:35.100
It's not about Mom,

20:35.200 --> 20:36.700
it's about you
and it's about stuff

20:36.800 --> 20:38.300
that she wanted you to know.

20:38.400 --> 20:39.900
She never got the
chance to tell you.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.300
Hey, Booth, there's a couple

20:47.400 --> 20:49.500
of things that you should know
about this guy, Kennedy.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.700
He's got an addiction
to model airplanes.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Try some of these again.
You'll love them.

21:02.100 --> 21:04.500
Wait, Dad...
What's...

21:04.600 --> 21:05.800
What's the second thing?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.000
Mmm, he's wily.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.300
You be careful, okay?

21:20.100 --> 21:21.100
Did you get that?

21:33.700 --> 21:35.500
I've got to tell you,
you were right, Zack.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.300
Every model airplane freak

21:37.400 --> 21:38.700
from Baltimore is here.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.600
We prefer the term "pilots."

21:40.700 --> 21:41.600
Yeah, okay.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.000
So you're into this stuff,
too, huh?

21:43.100 --> 21:45.600
Yeah, forensic anthropology
is only one of my doctorates.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.900
The other is in
applied engineering.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.300
I'm extremely adept at
practical aeronautics.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.500
Do you see Ice Pick?

21:50.800 --> 21:52.700
A lot of these guys are
kind of old.

21:53.600 --> 21:54.900
You know,
they're wearing those, uh...

21:55.000 --> 21:57.200
those sunglasses
that wrap around their heads.

21:57.800 --> 22:00.100
Well, how many of them
only have one leg?

22:00.200 --> 22:02.000
Well, half of them
are sitting down.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.000
Okay, how am I going to get them
to stand up?

22:04.300 --> 22:05.800
Crashes bring everyone
to their feet.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.600
W... uh, shoot down
one of the planes.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.100
That's great,
and the next thing you know,

22:09.200 --> 22:10.700
I'm being evaluated
by my shrink again.

22:10.800 --> 22:11.800
That's not going to happen.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.000
Drive onto the field.

22:13.001 --> 22:13.899
What?

22:13.900 --> 22:15.400
Put your car
where they like to land.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.400
Everyone will stand up
and yell at you.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.500
This better work.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.500
Okay, just stay with me here.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.000
Oops.

22:28.400 --> 22:29.300
Look at that, huh?

22:29.400 --> 22:30.400
It seems to be working.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.300
Ha, ha. Oh, they're mad.

22:35.600 --> 22:36.500
Do you see him?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.400
They're all wearing long pants.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.800
I mean, how can I tell if any of
them are wearing a prosthetic?

22:41.900 --> 22:43.400
The prosthetic will cause

22:43.500 --> 22:45.500
a slightly unnatural
alignment of the spine,

22:45.600 --> 22:47.900
which will result in a
compensating adjustment of...

22:48.000 --> 22:51.300
Booth, the instinct will be
for these men to step

22:51.400 --> 22:52.300
toward you.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.700
One man will be standing
perfectly still.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.400
Okay.

23:05.800 --> 23:06.600
Yep, I got him.

23:08.100 --> 23:09.000
Sorry.

23:09.100 --> 23:10.000
I apologize.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.600
Just passing through.

23:17.400 --> 23:18.900
Afternoon.

23:20.300 --> 23:21.700
Anybody asking after me?

23:22.500 --> 23:23.300
Nope.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.500
What the hell?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.100
I'm gonna need his room number.

24:02.500 --> 24:03.700
Maybe I can help you.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.400
What did you hit me with?

24:18.700 --> 24:19.500
Huh?

24:19.600 --> 24:21.900
Only reason I ask is my
tooth doesn't hurt anymore.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.400
You know, you're the first guy

24:24.500 --> 24:26.100
that got the drop on me
in ten years.

24:26.400 --> 24:28.000
I used to get that a lot.

24:29.900 --> 24:31.100
Can I ask you a question?

24:31.700 --> 24:33.700
As long as you answer one
for me, then.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.100
 ???

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
Huh?
What's your story?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.900
Billy Ray got
in the back of my cab.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.700
Don't know which one of us
was bigger surprised,

24:44.800 --> 24:46.600
but it must have been Billy Ray

24:46.700 --> 24:48.700
'cause he's the one
ended up dead.

24:51.100 --> 24:52.200
Hey, what's your question?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.300
How you people find him
under all that cement?

24:58.500 --> 24:59.400
A dog.

25:00.300 --> 25:01.800
Dog, huh?
Yeah.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.500
So why am I not dead?

25:05.000 --> 25:06.400
I never killed nobody for fun.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.500
It was my job.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
And I'm retired.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.100
Now, listen.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.600
I know you fellas get in trouble
if you lose your gun.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.100
I'm taking the bullets,
though, if you don't mind.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.000
Oh.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.700
Well, what about me?
Settle down.

25:23.800 --> 25:24.900
What?
Settle down, relax.

25:27.700 --> 25:28.700
Someone'll find you.

25:30.900 --> 25:32.000
You have a good day now.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.900
I just want to talk
about your mother.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.100
Booth is missing.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.500
It's been over 18 hours.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.100
He tried to take down
Hugh Kennedy by himself?

26:00.600 --> 26:02.600
He's only got one leg
and he's old.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.600
Yeah, you know
how he got old?

26:05.200 --> 26:07.700
By being fast and paranoid.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.300
He cut off his own leg.

26:10.300 --> 26:11.200
Booth is tough.

26:12.100 --> 26:13.100
What does the FBI say?

26:15.200 --> 26:16.200
Nothing.

26:17.300 --> 26:19.400
Yeah, "need to
know," right?

26:19.500 --> 26:20.600
Mm-hmm.

26:21.900 --> 26:25.300
I want to do something, but
I don't... I don't know what.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.500
Are you asking?

26:31.900 --> 26:34.200
You'd help find the man who's
going to put you in jail?

26:35.000 --> 26:37.600
Well, Booth will...
will do the best he can,

26:37.700 --> 26:38.600
I'll do the best I can,

26:38.700 --> 26:41.500
and we'll see how it works
out when we get there.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.600
W-Where did he find Kennedy?

26:44.800 --> 26:45.800
Baltimore.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.100
I'm afraid that's
not Hugh Kennedy.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.300
What's that called when they
wrap a sausage in a pancake?

26:54.600 --> 26:55.700
Pigs in a blanket.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.200
Pigs in a blanket.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.700
Now how'd you get here?

27:02.700 --> 27:03.800
How'd you get here?

27:04.100 --> 27:06.500
Billy Ray was killed
by an ice pick in Baltimore.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.400
We asked around.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.100
Was it Hugh Kennedy that
bundled you up in a carpet?

27:11.200 --> 27:13.000
Look, I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation

27:13.100 --> 27:15.000
with civilians, all right?
So just cut me out of here.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.700
Hey, what are you doing with my
gun? Put that down.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.500
Okay, time to step out
of your comfort zone, people.

27:24.600 --> 27:25.400
What comfort zone?

27:25.500 --> 27:27.400
We've stopped working.
I'd like to start again.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.800
We process evidence.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.500
There's no more evidence
for us to process.

27:30.600 --> 27:32.600
He's right. We process,
Booth interprets.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.200
I'd like to give it a try.

27:34.600 --> 27:36.300
Yeah, we suck at interpretation.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.300
We absolutely blow.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.500
Um, what do you want us to do?

27:39.700 --> 27:40.600
Work what we know.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.400
McKenna was probably killed
by Kennedy.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.600
Booth ran afoul of Kennedy.

27:43.602 --> 27:44.399
I'm with you.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.400
I'm with you, not ahead of you.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.700
Okay, is there any
forensic evidence on our victim

27:49.800 --> 27:51.400
that might lead
to Kennedy and Booth?

27:51.500 --> 27:53.000
Yeah, I mean,
I've finished the inventory

27:53.100 --> 27:54.300
on McKenna's tracksuit.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.600
There were flakes
of tobacco,

27:55.700 --> 27:57.200
fibers from the upholstery

27:57.300 --> 27:58.200
of a Crown Victoria,

27:58.500 --> 28:00.000
popcorn, chocolate,

28:00.100 --> 28:03.100
a host of other wool
and cotton threads.

28:03.300 --> 28:04.500
Okay, what does that tell us?

28:04.600 --> 28:06.000
That the man was a pig?

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
All right, look,
there were also

28:08.600 --> 28:10.900
cellulose fibers
consistent with newsprint,

28:11.000 --> 28:12.900
gum from a number
of different mouths.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.900
Uh, he had dried
chunks of human mucous,

28:15.000 --> 28:16.600
a half dozen
filaments of nylon

28:16.700 --> 28:17.900
consistent with
women's hosiery.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.900
Oh! Uh, Kennedy
was a transvestite.

28:23.100 --> 28:24.000
Keep going.

28:24.700 --> 28:26.200
The rest was
just waxy buildup

28:26.300 --> 28:28.000
from soap
or upholstery cleaner.

28:29.200 --> 28:32.000
Let's assume
all this adds up to a place.

28:34.000 --> 28:34.900
Crime scene.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.400
Close your eyes

28:36.500 --> 28:38.700
and imagine the smell
of all those things.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.300
Tobacco, snot,

28:44.400 --> 28:45.300
gum,

28:46.600 --> 28:47.600
popcorn,

28:48.000 --> 28:50.700
a lot of clothing, chocolate...

28:50.800 --> 28:51.700
A porno movie theater!

28:51.800 --> 28:52.900
You can't smoke at the movies.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.500
I don't know about porno.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.300
Upholstery cleaner,
Crown Victoria...

28:58.000 --> 28:58.900
I got it.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.000
A taxi cab.

29:01.900 --> 29:03.500
McKenna was killed
in a taxi cab.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.000
Yes.

29:06.800 --> 29:07.800
Where are you going?

29:08.200 --> 29:09.100
To tell the FBI

29:09.200 --> 29:11.100
they're looking for a one-legged
cabbie in Baltimore.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.300
You know, you guys,
 it's not like

29:19.400 --> 29:21.200
we all know each other
off the field, so...

29:21.300 --> 29:23.800
But you know a man
with a prosthetic leg?

29:24.000 --> 29:26.200
Uh... yeah,
I've seen him around.

29:26.500 --> 29:27.500
We need his name.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.000
No, honey,
he'd be using a fake name.

29:29.100 --> 29:30.200
No, we need to know
where he lives.

29:30.300 --> 29:32.300
Well, maybe he's listed
under his fake name.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.300
He's too careful for that.

29:36.800 --> 29:38.000
He drives a cab.

29:38.500 --> 29:39.300
How do you know that?

29:39.600 --> 29:41.400
My associates
are very good, Dad.

29:41.500 --> 29:42.100
Can I ask a question?

29:42.200 --> 29:44.300
Do you guys have any, like,
official I.D. or anything?

29:44.400 --> 29:46.300
I can have the FBI here
in 20 minutes.
No, no, no.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.300
Screw the FBI.
No, no, no!

29:47.400 --> 29:48.300
Hold on! Easy!

29:48.301 --> 29:49.199
Take it easy, pal.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.800
Where does he live?
I don't know!

29:51.000 --> 29:51.800
Dad!
No!

29:51.900 --> 29:54.100
All right, all right!
Halton Inn on Decatur.

29:54.900 --> 29:56.200
No, no, no!
Dad, he told us!

29:56.300 --> 29:58.100
Are you lying to me? Because
if you are, I'll know it!

29:58.200 --> 30:00.800
Halton Inn on Decatur,
just past the tracks. Easy.

30:01.700 --> 30:02.600
Wha...?!

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
What's that all about?

30:05.500 --> 30:06.500
Thank you.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.900
You're welcome.
Your dad's a psycho,

30:08.000 --> 30:10.200
by the way.
You have no idea.

30:12.700 --> 30:15.100
Do you have a one-legged
old man staying here?

30:18.800 --> 30:20.100
Give me 40 bucks.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.500
Room number, please.

30:23.600 --> 30:24.900
Dad!

30:25.100 --> 30:26.700
I... I have money.

30:32.300 --> 30:33.200
Dad, look out!

30:33.700 --> 30:34.700
Who is she?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.200
I don't think
she's going to tell us.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.100
Come on, help me!

30:47.200 --> 30:48.000
Pull! Pull!

30:52.300 --> 30:53.600
 ???

30:54.200 --> 30:57.900
Hey. Hey, listen to me.
I like you.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.100
But if you make
another move on me,

31:00.800 --> 31:02.000
I will hurt you. You understand?

31:02.400 --> 31:04.700
If her name's Veleska,
she's the same bounty hunter

31:04.800 --> 31:06.100
who brought in Kennedy's leg.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.100
How'd you find him?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.000
It's not that hard
to find a one-legged,

31:10.100 --> 31:11.600
old, white hit man
in Baltimore.

31:12.500 --> 31:13.500
Why is she after him?

31:13.900 --> 31:15.200
She has to make sure
that Kennedy

31:15.300 --> 31:16.600
stays gone.
I helped

31:16.700 --> 31:18.300
a wanted fugitive evade arrest.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.600
I'm not going to jail.

31:19.900 --> 31:20.800
What have you got?

31:21.100 --> 31:22.800
It's a left anterior molar.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.600
It's Booth's tooth.

31:26.201 --> 31:27.099
Where's Booth?

31:27.100 --> 31:28.200
Temperance, honey!

31:29.400 --> 31:30.800
Kennedy has Booth, Dad.

31:30.900 --> 31:31.900
He's got Booth!
Okay.

31:37.300 --> 31:39.100
Perhaps he didn't see Kennedy.

31:39.200 --> 31:41.300
Yeah? How'd you come
to that thought?

31:41.601 --> 31:42.499
Well, Kennedy would
have left him

31:42.500 --> 31:45.000
with an ice pick
protruding from his head.

31:45.700 --> 31:48.000
Just one simple
question, big dog.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.000
Did you see Kennedy?

31:51.400 --> 31:53.100
Well, we could
get our own ice pick.

31:53.300 --> 31:56.000
Make it look
like Kennedy killed him.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.400
You know we can't let you live,
right?

31:58.500 --> 32:00.700
You've been struck
and restrained.

32:00.800 --> 32:03.800
Technically, kidnapping
a federal agent is as bad

32:03.900 --> 32:05.500
as murdering him
these days.

32:07.400 --> 32:08.600
How would you like to kill him?

32:08.800 --> 32:12.800
First, I got to know for sure
if Kennedy is dead or alive.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.600
Good luck with that one,
big dog.

32:16.700 --> 32:17.500
Oh, big dog.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.600
I suppose we could do that thing
that McKenna used to do,

32:21.300 --> 32:24.200
but I'd need a blowtorch
and a sharpened screwdriver.

32:24.700 --> 32:25.600
Just tell us.

32:26.600 --> 32:27.500
Woof.

32:31.100 --> 32:31.900
Cute.
Oh!

32:32.000 --> 32:33.400
Must be his kid.
Yeah.

32:37.100 --> 32:38.400
Head like a anvil.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.200
I hurt my hand.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.300
All right.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.600
I'm gonna let you take a look
at your sweet boy,

32:46.800 --> 32:48.700
consign his face
into your memory,

32:49.300 --> 32:52.600
and then I'm gonna ask you which
one of your eyes you like best.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.500
Definitely Booth's tooth.

33:10.900 --> 33:11.700
I knew it.

33:14.300 --> 33:15.100
Brennan...

33:17.100 --> 33:18.300
You're not alone in this.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.900
I know I'm not alone.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.700
We all want to find Booth.

33:22.900 --> 33:23.900
I know.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.800
This is one of those times
when I have no idea
what's happening.

33:28.900 --> 33:29.600
Brennan, wait.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.500
I have to go, Ange.
What's going on?

33:31.600 --> 33:32.700
I've got to find Booth.

33:32.800 --> 33:33.900
I'm coming with you.
No.

33:34.200 --> 33:36.000
I can't fight
or shoot a gun,

33:36.100 --> 33:39.400
but if something bad
happens, I can spit
with deadly accuracy.

33:39.500 --> 33:40.500
Thanks, but no.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.300
Why can't you tell me?

33:42.400 --> 33:44.000
By definition,
I can't tell you.

33:44.200 --> 33:48.000
All right, all right,
Hodgins is outside
in his fastest car.

33:48.700 --> 33:49.600
It's Italian.

33:50.100 --> 33:51.900
One call and he follows
you everywhere.

33:51.901 --> 33:52.699
Angela...

33:52.900 --> 33:55.600
All right, you're after a
crazy, old, ice pick hit man

33:55.700 --> 33:56.700
who has Booth.

33:57.000 --> 33:57.900
You need help.

33:58.700 --> 33:59.800
Look at my face.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.900
Do you really see
me backing down?

34:03.700 --> 34:06.700
I... I already have help, Ange.

34:07.400 --> 34:08.300
From who?

34:09.100 --> 34:10.900
From someone
worse than Kennedy.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.500
Are you serious?

34:12.600 --> 34:13.500
Don't say it.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.000
You're father
is helping you?
I have to go.

34:24.600 --> 34:25.600
Dad!

34:27.100 --> 34:28.000
Was it Booth's tooth?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.400
Yes. Stop that.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.199
What are you doing?

34:32.100 --> 34:34.199
Well, we have to know for sure
if Kennedy is alive or dead.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.300
I mean, what if she and
her friends took Booth?

34:38.400 --> 34:41.199
If this bothers you,
maybe you should go.

34:41.699 --> 34:44.400
No, alpha male,
man of action...

34:44.500 --> 34:46.199
I... I get it.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.900
Now, tell us.

34:52.100 --> 34:54.000
Okay... okay...

34:56.100 --> 34:57.300
Kennedy is alive.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.600
I was chasing him
for the bail.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.600
He was smarter than me,
and he gave me a choice:

35:05.100 --> 35:07.600
help him fake his death
or die myself.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.400
Where'd you get the body?

35:10.400 --> 35:13.600
We stole some dead old geezer
from a mortuary in Charleston.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.200
Where is my partner?

35:17.000 --> 35:19.100
When I got here,
no one was here.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.100
I swear.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.300
What do we do with her?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.700
The room is paid for
through the end of the week.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.500
Kennedy does not have Booth.

35:39.700 --> 35:40.500
How do you know?

35:41.400 --> 35:42.600
He's only got one leg.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.100
So?

35:44.800 --> 35:46.500
Well, so he's retired.

35:46.600 --> 35:47.500
He's like me.

35:47.600 --> 35:49.700
He just... he just
wants to disappear.

35:51.200 --> 35:52.400
Then who's got Booth?

35:53.000 --> 35:56.400
Well, there's only one other
significant player in all this.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.100
 ???

36:02.800 --> 36:05.100
What am I going to do
with you when I 
get to the lab?

36:05.400 --> 36:07.500
I'll just take a nap
here in the car.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.100
Awfully exciting day
for an old guy like me.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.500
Booth is being held
by Melvin Gallagher.

36:15.600 --> 36:16.700
That's a leap.
How do you know?

36:16.800 --> 36:18.900
Can we just go
with this, please?

36:19.000 --> 36:19.900
Of course not.

36:20.300 --> 36:22.800
Obviously, Brennan found
out from her father--

36:22.900 --> 36:24.900
who is a wanted fugitive.
Ange!

36:25.000 --> 36:26.200
Now that I can go with.

36:26.300 --> 36:29.200
We need to figure out where
Gallagher is holding Booth.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.700
Has anybody noticed that every
time there's a panic situation,

36:40.000 --> 36:41.500
all eyes turn to Hodgins?

36:41.600 --> 36:42.300
It's okay.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.700
What's he
supposed to do?

36:43.800 --> 36:45.700
Shoes.
Shoes?

36:45.800 --> 36:47.500
Gallagher said the last time
he saw McKenna

36:47.600 --> 36:50.300
he was leaving for vacation
after a tough night at work.

36:50.400 --> 36:51.600
You think Gallagher might have
a place

36:51.700 --> 36:53.000
he takes people
for that sort of thing?

36:53.100 --> 36:55.400
Let me go over
Cement Head's shoes--
see what they tell us.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.300
Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone.

37:02.500 --> 37:03.300
It's a solvent.

37:03.400 --> 37:05.300
See if it has any
specialized uses.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.300
Also chromic

37:09.300 --> 37:13.200
MEK and chromic acid are both
used to prepare metals.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.100
Prepare metals for what?

37:15.200 --> 37:18.900
Coating-- painting mostly.
Electroplating.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.000
I'm seeing micro-thin deposits
of aluminum here.

37:22.300 --> 37:23.100
Shavings?

37:23.200 --> 37:26.800
No, it's more anodized...
vapor deposition.

37:27.900 --> 37:29.100
Gallagher flies everywhere?

37:29.800 --> 37:33.100
An aluminum propeller requires
a coating that could withstand

37:33.200 --> 37:35.600
between ten and 20 tons
of centrifugal force.

37:35.800 --> 37:37.500
Preferably anodized.

37:38.400 --> 37:39.800
These are Gallagher's
tax returns.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.400
We're looking for the
purchase of any machine

37:41.500 --> 37:42.800
that could be used
for anodization.

37:42.900 --> 37:44.100
What, like
a copier, or...?

37:44.200 --> 37:45.900
Oh, that's so
cute, but no.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.800
Look for the words
"lamination, electroplating."

37:48.900 --> 37:51.500
"Alloy membranes,
catalytic bed reactor..."

37:51.700 --> 37:53.200
"A serial thermal processor."

37:53.300 --> 37:54.800
"Vacuum pyrolysis."

37:54.900 --> 37:57.600
"D-330 Vacuum plating
processor"?

37:57.700 --> 37:59.300
Yeah, that's it.
That's it.

38:06.500 --> 38:09.000
Yes, this is Dr. Brennan
at the Jeffersonian.

38:09.100 --> 38:12.000
I just received a call
from Agent Booth

38:12.100 --> 38:15.000
that he's being
held at...

38:15.400 --> 38:18.000
the Purdue Airfield
in Oakville, Virginia.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.100
Send backup, I'm going in.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.600
You just lied your ass off

38:24.000 --> 38:25.800
to the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.400
That is so hot.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.600
If you lie really still,
you may not die.

40:04.000 --> 40:04.900
I need your car.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.600
Max Keenan,
you're under arrest.

40:06.700 --> 40:07.900
Not if I get the keys.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.600
They're in the ignition.

40:15.900 --> 40:18.600
Well, it's not like I actually
gave him the keys.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.300
Why didn't you just... just
tell them about Kennedy?

40:58.600 --> 41:00.900
Well, I needed to give
you time to find me.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.000
I've been tortured worse.

41:05.300 --> 41:07.400
So, uh, you hear anything
from your old man?

41:16.900 --> 41:18.600
He left my car in the garage.

41:26.900 --> 41:27.800
He'll be back.

41:29.100 --> 41:29.900
How do you know?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.300
Max Keenan does not strike
me as the kind of guy

41:32.400 --> 41:35.000
who, uh, leaves things undone.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.600
Next time he shows up,
what do I do?

41:40.700 --> 41:43.000
Do I call you?
Do I knock him on the head?

41:43.200 --> 41:44.400
What's my obligation?

41:44.600 --> 41:45.500
Well, if I were you, Bones,

41:45.600 --> 41:47.800
I'd want to know what he has
to tell you about your mother.

41:48.100 --> 41:51.000
But, uh... that's just me.

41:58.000 --> 42:01.100
There's, uh, this old song.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.100
It's called "Keep on Trying."

42:04.700 --> 42:06.200
Yeah, Poco.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.900
You know it?

42:36.500 --> 42:37.400
Yeah, what about it?

42:40.100 --> 42:41.500
It's a good old song, right?

42:44.100 --> 42:45.200
Right.
