00:22.556 --> 00:23.191
(Wind blowing)

00:23.192 --> 00:25.093
(Soft rock music)

01:49.210 --> 01:52.880
- Princess Berry, where are you?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.683
(Magical music)

01:58.186 --> 01:59.186
Princess Berry is late.

01:59.387 --> 02:01.222
Where could she be?

02:01.989 --> 02:02.989
- I'm here, I'm sorry.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.393
(Queen laughs)

02:06.093 --> 02:07.093
- [Queen] There you are.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.095
- I'm sorry I'm late, my queen.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.798
It was the donkey's fault.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.732
(Tongue clicking)

02:13.967 --> 02:15.468
- It's best not to blame others
for your own misfortunes.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.905
- But this time it really
was the donkey's fault.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.508
He fell down flat on his belly!

02:21.108 --> 02:23.244
- On his belly?

02:26.214 --> 02:27.214
- [Princess Berry]
Yes, flat on his belly

02:27.215 --> 02:28.516
down by the stream.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.384
(Laughing)

02:31.084 --> 02:32.220
(Elevator beeping)

02:41.094 --> 02:44.765
- [Female recording] 42nd floor.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.310
(Finger tapping)

03:30.010 --> 03:31.979
(Sighing)

03:40.921 --> 03:44.525
(Soft music)

03:51.098 --> 03:54.802
- [Therapist] And how was
the dream different this time?

03:56.337 --> 03:58.577
- [Frankie voiceover] This
time, everything goes dark and

04:01.074 --> 04:03.377
I'm there alone in the water,

04:07.047 --> 04:08.327
desperately trying to climb out,

04:12.052 --> 04:13.487
but I can't.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.429
This time, I feel like
something is pulling me down.

04:27.468 --> 04:30.971
- [Therapist] Hm.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.580
Can you describe what it
is that's pulling you down?

04:39.179 --> 04:42.516
- I don't know.

04:43.417 --> 04:44.517
Frankie king, Blaze talent,

04:44.518 --> 04:45.785
reading for the role
of surprised woman.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.788
Maybe my job, my relationship.

04:51.725 --> 04:55.061
- [Therapist] And
what's the status there?

04:55.062 --> 04:58.532
- Dax moved out so

04:59.567 --> 05:00.887
it's over.
- All right, we got it.

05:03.371 --> 05:04.804
Let's rap on Frankie.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.272
- [Frankie voiceover] We're
not good for each other.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.273
(Crew applauding)

05:08.442 --> 05:09.276
- [Therapist]
This is a big step.

05:09.277 --> 05:11.412
- [Frankie voiceover] Yeah.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.981
- [Therapist] So
how does it feel

05:14.982 --> 05:16.550
to close that chapter?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.145
- [Frankie voiceover]
I don't know.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.563
I still have a lot of
open chapters in my life.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.967
Go inside and
wash up for dinner.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.649
- [Princess Berry] Oh, I
surely don't deserve dinner.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.649
I was late and i'm
terribly upset with myself.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.710
- Accidents happen.

05:44.311 --> 05:46.671
Now, run along and let me
have a few words with this donkey.

05:47.848 --> 05:51.351
- [Princess Berry]
Thank you, my queen.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.755
- And what do you
have to say for yourself?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.312
And this is where the
donkey starts talking.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.098
- Okay, cut.

06:05.899 --> 06:06.899
Back to one.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.334
(Crew chattering)

06:12.072 --> 06:14.808
So, I think we're slipping
a bit too far into caricature.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.647
- But she is a
caricature, Marcus.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.449
- Yeah, but we need
her more tender,

06:24.151 --> 06:25.919
a bit more real, a bit
more grandmotherly.

06:26.754 --> 06:29.790
- Okay, more grandmotherly.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.092
- And just a bit more.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.060
(Inhaling softly)

06:34.495 --> 06:36.864
(Inhaling softly)

06:37.498 --> 06:38.498
- You got it.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.199
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

06:57.551 --> 07:01.121
(Disconcerting music)

07:28.015 --> 07:31.585
(Soft gasp)

07:32.152 --> 07:33.754
(Hands clapping)

07:34.488 --> 07:36.456
(Laughing excitedly)

07:53.607 --> 07:57.477
Hey Grayson, it's Frankie.

08:00.380 --> 08:03.884
I got your message.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.998
I don't really know what to say.

08:07.354 --> 08:10.090
Call me back.

08:15.095 --> 08:18.599
(Crew chattering)

08:21.334 --> 08:22.334
(Door humming)

08:26.239 --> 08:27.919
- [Kim] I'm so sorry,
that's terrible news.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.371
- [Frankie] I hadn't
spoken to them in years.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.781
- Well, still.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.481
- How long do you need?

08:36.584 --> 08:38.064
- I don't know, a
week, a couple days.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.521
- I lost my father
three years ago.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.793
Couldn't sleep, got
addicted to ativan.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.062
- We only have the
donkey booked until Friday

08:51.665 --> 08:53.042
so that's gonna
be a bit of an issue.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.101
- Jesus, Marcus.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.468
We can get, we can
get another donkey.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.138
- But this is a
really great donkey.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.617
- No, can you give
us some space?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.776
(Marcus sighs)

09:05.045 --> 09:06.325
Look, I'll see what I can swing.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.315
Take the rest of the week.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.750
- I may not even need to
go, we weren't very close.

09:11.919 --> 09:15.789
- Frankie, you have to go.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.991
I'll see what I can do.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.795
Take the week.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.270
(Disconcerting music)

09:46.186 --> 09:49.723
- [Frankie voiceover]
I'm scared...

09:50.691 --> 09:52.726
To go back.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.733
But I feel like I have to.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.054
- [Therapist] And
what's the fear?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.806
What's scary about this?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.176
- [Frankie] Judgment.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.003
- [Therapist] Who
are you picturing now?

10:15.448 --> 10:16.448
- [Frankie] Everyone.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.888
My brother.

10:24.792 --> 10:25.325
- [Therapist] Are
you in touch with him?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.325
- [Frankie] Grayson?

10:26.559 --> 10:27.761
Not really.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.230
He's a...

10:33.366 --> 10:34.366
Difficult person.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.729
I think he resents me
for leaving the family.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.922
- [Therapist] And how
do you feel about it,

10:46.613 --> 10:48.782
your decision to leave?

10:50.150 --> 10:52.150
- [Frankie voiceover] I
did what I thought I needed

10:53.220 --> 10:55.756
at the time.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.589
(Planes humming)

11:04.732 --> 11:08.435
- I'm happy to inform you
you're eligible for an upgrade.

11:09.269 --> 11:10.771
No extra cost.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.404
- An upgrade?

11:13.406 --> 11:15.107
- Correct, you reserved
an economy vehicle.

11:15.108 --> 11:15.943
It looks like I can upgrade
you to a full-size vehicle,

11:15.944 --> 11:18.445
four doors, a lot more room.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.680
- It's just me.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.381
- Well, treat yourself.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.217
- Okay.

11:25.652 --> 11:27.286
- Excellent.

11:27.287 --> 11:28.055
So, what brings you to
this area, work or pleasure?

11:28.056 --> 11:31.925
- It's work, hard work.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.653
- And will you be wanting
our collision coverage today?

11:37.297 --> 11:41.001
- Yeah, please.

11:49.877 --> 11:53.446
(Horn honking)

11:54.214 --> 11:56.850
(Laughing)

11:57.384 --> 11:58.384
Great.

12:09.997 --> 12:13.801
(Upbeat rock music)

13:06.820 --> 13:10.357
- Throughout the
whole thing, not one.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.993
I think that's that girl.

13:13.726 --> 13:14.726
- Oh, don't talk.

13:14.928 --> 13:15.928
- Turn around.

13:15.929 --> 13:16.929
- I don't want to look.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.931
- Turn around.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.492
Isn't she the one that
was on that show?

13:22.269 --> 13:23.269
- Excuse me?

13:26.706 --> 13:27.826
I don't mean to be a bother.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.642
- No.

13:32.179 --> 13:32.479
- Are you the one that's in
the chocolate bar commercial?

13:32.480 --> 13:35.849
- Yeah.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.449
- It's her!

13:38.385 --> 13:39.086
- For heaven's sake, we
knew we had seen yous.

13:39.087 --> 13:41.354
I told you, Betty.

13:42.122 --> 13:43.256
Can we get a picture?

13:43.991 --> 13:44.991
Get in there, Betty!

13:45.725 --> 13:46.994
- [Betty] Do you mind?

13:49.629 --> 13:52.866
(Camera clicking)

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
(Crickets chirping)

14:24.898 --> 14:28.535
(Crying)

14:29.469 --> 14:30.537
(Breathing heavily)

15:13.380 --> 15:17.017
(Birds chirping)

15:18.618 --> 15:19.619
(Motor humming)

15:36.903 --> 15:40.373
- Hey.
- Grayson.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.928
- Were you gonna
tell me you're in town

15:43.810 --> 15:44.977
or you're just gonna wait for me

15:44.978 --> 15:46.345
to find ya roaming the streets?

15:46.346 --> 15:48.186
- I'm sorry, I was gonna
call you this morning.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.842
- Come on, get in,
let's grab breakfast.

15:51.218 --> 15:53.653
- Yeah, okay.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.430
- Don't we see you on
TV all the time, that show?

16:03.863 --> 16:06.266
- Yeah.

16:07.100 --> 16:09.136
- That little shithead loves it.

16:10.037 --> 16:11.404
I guess that's kids nowadays.

16:12.605 --> 16:13.273
That's all they want is
screens and screens.

16:13.274 --> 16:16.409
- What is he, three now?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.278
- No, he's four.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.811
- Wow.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.548
- Mm-hm.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.510
When we try and tell him that

16:25.452 --> 16:26.585
that's his auntie
Frankie up there,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.426
(laughs) He just looks
at us like we're morons.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.692
Well, that's auntie Frankie!

16:34.294 --> 16:35.762
Auntie Frankie king. (Laughs)

16:38.298 --> 16:39.898
That's a heck of a
name you picked there.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.035
Is that real, Frankie king?

16:43.303 --> 16:44.003
Does it say that on
your driver's license or?

16:44.004 --> 16:45.138
- It's a stage name.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.440
- A stage name.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.541
- Yeah, my agent
thought it would...

16:49.542 --> 16:51.578
Would you excuse
me for a moment?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.446
- Fill your boots.

16:57.884 --> 17:01.454
(Exhaling)

17:05.825 --> 17:09.429
So how long you in town for?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.031
- [Frankie voiceover]
I don't know.

17:13.200 --> 17:13.933
How long should
I be in town for?

17:13.934 --> 17:15.174
- I don't really care, I guess.

17:15.835 --> 17:18.305
I'm sorry if that's...

17:18.905 --> 17:20.572
- No, it's fine.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.185
It's just you haven't
really been a part of things

17:22.209 --> 17:23.610
for a while here, Frankie.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.097
You can't just
waltz in and expect

17:26.813 --> 17:27.853
to run the show, you know?

17:28.381 --> 17:29.661
- I don't expect
to run the show.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.459
- You married?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.360
Got a boyfriend or?

17:44.664 --> 17:46.433
- No.

17:46.899 --> 17:47.899
- Sucks.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.550
You know, just 'cause your
eggs aren't gettin' any younger.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.076
I actually just read
a study, you know,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.978
it's actually not safe
for women your age

17:59.979 --> 18:02.179
'cause the kids they come
out all retarded or, you know,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.702
it's just a roll of the dice.
- I got a salad for you.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.319
Burger and fries for you.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.820
Can I get you
folks anything else?

18:08.821 --> 18:09.489
- No, Janice, we're
perfect, thank you.

18:09.490 --> 18:11.123
- Okay, great, enjoy that.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.592
(Soft country music)

18:15.195 --> 18:16.755
- What makes you
think I even want kids?

18:19.199 --> 18:21.501
- Hm?

18:22.302 --> 18:23.302
- [Frankie] Nevermind.

18:25.905 --> 18:26.905
- So they, um.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.957
They got the
autopsy report back.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.560
I guess dad just had a
heart attack behind the wheel.

18:38.985 --> 18:41.321
Yeah.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.190
Just like that.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.506
The car rolls like
seven times so

18:48.328 --> 18:50.330
he just takes mom with him.

18:56.403 --> 19:01.607
Anyhow. (Clears throat)

19:01.608 --> 19:03.343
Got a meeting with
the lawyer later on so.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.613
You can come, I guess.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.847
- It's up to you.

19:18.958 --> 19:22.629
(Phone ringing)

19:23.363 --> 19:25.765
- Grayson Bingley.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.467
Yeah.

19:28.868 --> 19:29.868
Yeah, for sure.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.203
I'll be right there.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.605
Okay.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.554
Hey, I gotta pop by work
for a minute, you mind?

19:37.143 --> 19:40.747
- Fill your boots.

19:47.119 --> 19:50.557
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.525
- How's it goin'?
- All right.

19:52.526 --> 19:53.686
- This is my sister, Frankie.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.473
Frankie, this is
my boss, Rhonda.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.195
- Hi, I didn't know
you had a sister.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.232
- Yeah, well, voila. (Chuckles)

20:00.132 --> 20:02.602
So what's up with that pipe?

20:03.903 --> 20:04.837
- There was a break
in the line, I'll show you.

20:04.838 --> 20:06.205
- All right.

20:07.374 --> 20:07.707
Just give me a
bit, I'll find you.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.476
- Sure.

20:11.278 --> 20:12.358
- Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

20:29.095 --> 20:32.599
(Machine humming)

20:51.318 --> 20:56.355
- All right, I know that
none of this is easy

20:56.356 --> 20:57.656
so I'll try and make this as
painless as possible, okay?

20:57.657 --> 20:59.577
All right, so the last
amendment to this document

21:00.627 --> 21:02.187
was in 2015 when
Grayson's son was born.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.640
Grayson, you've been
appointed executor of the estate.

21:04.664 --> 21:07.266
- Okay.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.034
What does that mean?

21:11.270 --> 21:12.270
- Well, basically
it's a responsibility

21:12.271 --> 21:13.271
to fulfill the will,
close the estate,

21:13.272 --> 21:14.432
all of its assets, tax stuff.

21:14.807 --> 21:15.807
There's a list.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.796
- What about the house
or what's inside the house

21:19.111 --> 21:21.914
like jewelry or China
or, I don't know.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.584
- It's up to you.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.185
Keep it, sell it, whatever.

21:26.186 --> 21:27.487
- Okay.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.188
And what if I get hit
by a bus tomorrow?

21:30.189 --> 21:31.967
- Then it goes down the line
to your spouse, your child.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.626
- Okay.
- Okay?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.581
All right, so I am going
to paraphrase here.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.349
We give, devise and
bequeath our estate

21:38.798 --> 21:40.032
and all of its related assets,

21:41.668 --> 21:42.335
all tangible personal
property, money, real estate

21:42.336 --> 21:43.770
to Grayson Bingley.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.038
Please see appendix five.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.940
Appendix five states that
$25,000 from the estate

21:48.941 --> 21:51.043
is to be donated to the
bankview united church.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.080
- Oh, that makes sense.

21:55.782 --> 21:57.282
I mean, our family is a pretty
big part of the church so.

21:57.283 --> 21:59.886
- I also have a small rsp and
$12,000 in a checking account.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.924
I also have two life
insurance policies

22:06.859 --> 22:08.236
with Grayson named
beneficiary on those.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.663
- What about Frankie?

22:13.332 --> 22:14.332
- I'm sorry, Frankie.

22:19.406 --> 22:22.675
- Makes sense.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.423
- Okay, I'm gonna
need some signatures

22:26.012 --> 22:26.446
to get the ball rolling.

22:26.879 --> 22:29.081
- Yeah.

22:29.816 --> 22:30.816
Sure.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.987
- I'm gonna wait outside.

22:37.824 --> 22:41.528
(Sighs)

23:02.081 --> 23:05.652
(Doorbell chiming)

23:09.922 --> 23:12.892
- Hi, can I just get a
black coffee please?

23:20.132 --> 23:23.770
(Boots thudding)

23:33.412 --> 23:37.049
Frankie?

23:37.784 --> 23:38.784
- Hi.

23:40.620 --> 23:41.620
- It's Bruce.

23:42.489 --> 23:43.556
- Yeah, I know, of course.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.056
Hi.

23:46.058 --> 23:46.793
- I didn't know if
you recognized me.

23:46.794 --> 23:48.060
- No, you look the same.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.530
- Liar.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.164
- Well, I recognized you so.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.325
- [Bruce] I assume you're
in town 'cause of your folks.

23:55.367 --> 23:57.970
- Yeah, you heard it?

23:58.771 --> 23:59.972
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.208
It's a real tragedy.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.544
- Thanks.

24:05.344 --> 24:06.384
- So where you livin' now?

24:07.980 --> 24:09.860
- I move back and forth
between la and Vancouver

24:10.617 --> 24:13.452
so I'm kind of all
over the place.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.331
- Yeah, I heard you're
doing the acting thing.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.395
- [Frankie] Yeah. (Laughs)

24:18.090 --> 24:18.825
- Some folks were saying
they saw you on TV.

24:18.826 --> 24:20.126
- Yeah, I'm in a few shoes.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.772
- I don't actually own a TV
so I wouldn't have seen ya.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.833
- So what are you
doing these days?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.467
- [Bruce] Still got
the family farm.

24:29.569 --> 24:30.970
Teaching at b high.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.239
- You're teaching?

24:34.473 --> 24:35.793
- Yeah, yeah, it's
just mechanics.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.010
- [Frankie] That's great.

24:40.379 --> 24:42.739
- [Bruce] Yeah, well, it was
great running into ya, Frankie.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.719
- Yeah, nice to see you.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.688
- Yeah, really nice.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.216
All right, well,
condolences again.

24:52.158 --> 24:54.827
And I'll see you around.

24:55.728 --> 24:56.863
- [Frankie] See you around.

24:59.699 --> 25:00.699
(Doorbell chiming)

25:16.215 --> 25:19.719
(Children chattering)

25:20.720 --> 25:22.955
(Motor humming)

25:25.291 --> 25:27.226
(Horn honking)

25:28.695 --> 25:30.597
- You okay?

25:31.363 --> 25:32.964
- Yeah, I'm fine.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.725
- Listen, just 'cause
you're not in the will.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.608
- I'm not actually here
for the money, Grayson.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.306
- You want a lift back?

25:43.009 --> 25:44.075
- [Frankie] No, I'm gonna
walk around for a bit.

25:44.076 --> 25:47.113
- All right.

25:55.454 --> 25:59.025
Hey.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.413
I have an appointment
tomorrow with the funeral stuff.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.265
If you wanna come to that.

26:09.501 --> 26:11.003
- Yeah, okay.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.839
- All right.

26:13.305 --> 26:14.305
At 10am.

26:15.808 --> 26:16.808
- See ya then.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.810
(Motor humming)

26:26.018 --> 26:29.689
I'm not quite sure how
to be out here, ya know?

26:35.127 --> 26:37.630
How to smile back at people
who smile at you on the street.

26:39.165 --> 26:43.869
- [Therapist] And you don't
get this feeling at home?

26:43.870 --> 26:46.372
- [Frankie] No, not
really, it's suffocating here.

26:47.774 --> 26:51.243
- [Therapist] Why
do you think that is?

26:52.812 --> 26:54.589
- [Frankie voiceover] I
don't know, maybe because I

26:54.613 --> 26:55.733
thought I'd never come back.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.717
- [Therapist] But you did.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.186
- Yeah.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.288
(Distorted speech)

27:02.289 --> 27:04.891
Sheila?

27:06.693 --> 27:07.693
(Distorted speech)

27:07.727 --> 27:08.861
Sheila?

27:09.461 --> 27:10.461
(Finger tapping)

27:14.066 --> 27:15.066
(Sighing)

27:33.552 --> 27:37.189
(Door creaking)

27:42.962 --> 27:46.766
(Clock ticking softly)

27:51.503 --> 27:55.174
(Floor creaking)

27:55.742 --> 27:58.010
(Alarm ringing)

28:20.833 --> 28:24.436
(Soft piano music)

28:45.257 --> 28:48.828
Right.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.488
(Birds chirping)

29:40.746 --> 29:44.316
(Vibrator buzzing)

29:47.519 --> 29:48.519
(Sighing)

30:56.588 --> 31:00.159
(Bed creaking)

31:07.866 --> 31:11.437
(Bed creaking)

31:36.295 --> 31:40.099
(Disconcerting music)

31:44.570 --> 31:48.274
(Door shutting)

31:49.308 --> 31:51.077
(Disconcerting music)

31:54.680 --> 31:56.248
(Gasping)

31:58.951 --> 32:00.751
(Water splashing)

32:00.752 --> 32:01.687
(Screaming)

32:01.688 --> 32:03.322
(Gasping)

32:03.956 --> 32:05.591
(Panting)

32:20.039 --> 32:23.609
Wha?

32:49.535 --> 32:53.139
(Insects chirping)

33:54.166 --> 33:57.736
(Mysterious music)

34:31.470 --> 34:35.141
- I don't really know
how it all shakes down

34:36.408 --> 34:38.086
but apparently I'm in
charge of the estate so.

34:38.110 --> 34:40.546
- You're executor.

34:41.347 --> 34:42.447
- [Grayson] That's it.

34:42.448 --> 34:43.415
- [Pastor] How are you doing?

34:43.415 --> 34:44.350
Are you getting enough help?

34:44.351 --> 34:45.417
- Yeah, yeah.

34:46.452 --> 34:47.452
My sister showed
up so. (Chuckles)

34:47.453 --> 34:49.855
I don't know how much help

34:51.056 --> 34:51.823
she's gonna be.
- Your sister?

34:51.824 --> 34:53.090
- Yeah, she's back.

34:53.091 --> 34:53.959
She might come for your
share so watch out. (Chuckles)

34:53.960 --> 34:56.862
Ah, speak of the devil.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.230
- Oh, not literally.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.565
- Ah, depends on
who you're asking.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.767
- [Grayson] Frankie,
this is pastor Neil.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.034
- Frankie, it is such a
pleasure to finally meet you.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.138
And my condolences.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.174
- Thank you.

35:09.441 --> 35:10.608
- The pastor is gonna
be conducting the service

35:10.609 --> 35:12.144
for mom and dad at his church.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.280
- Your folks were such a
big part of this community

35:14.281 --> 35:16.315
and the church.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.015
- Don't I know it.

35:18.884 --> 35:20.218
- [Grayson] Well, hopefully
you won't turn to dust

35:20.219 --> 35:20.652
when you walk through
the church doors.

35:20.653 --> 35:22.421
- I just might.

35:23.355 --> 35:24.223
- I doubt she'll turn to dust.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.157
- I'm not very religious.

35:25.158 --> 35:26.591
- She's an atheist actually.

35:26.592 --> 35:28.112
Or what, you an
anarchist, what are you

35:28.960 --> 35:29.761
calling yourself nowadays?
- Right, thank you, Grayson.

35:29.762 --> 35:30.802
And why am I here exactly?

35:31.363 --> 35:32.723
- Okay, I have to
go, but please do

35:33.965 --> 35:36.302
take a look at those
passages that I sent you.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.184
If there are any changes and
if you want to say something.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.176
Okay?

35:46.512 --> 35:47.179
I'll see you both
at the service then.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.314
- Thank you.

35:52.551 --> 35:56.188
- I knew your
parents quite well.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.934
We spent quite a bit of time
together before my wife passed.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.294
- Which one of these
did you put your wife in?

36:02.861 --> 36:04.730
(Clears throat)

36:05.631 --> 36:06.791
- Cherry wood, it's the best.

36:07.032 --> 36:08.467
- Mom didn't want to be buried.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.190
I always remember
her saying that.

36:13.305 --> 36:14.706
- She didn't like the bugs.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.175
- Cremation is
also a lovely option.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.179
- $11,000, for this? (Knocking)

36:22.013 --> 36:26.717
- It's cherry.

36:26.718 --> 36:27.985
- You know, I can
build one of them

36:27.986 --> 36:29.587
and Bury 'em out back the
house for next to nothing.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.268
- Well, that would
be illegal, Mr. Bingley.

36:31.423 --> 36:32.423
- This is robbery, sir.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.192
- Sorry you feel that way.

36:34.960 --> 36:36.194
This is my livelihood,

36:37.496 --> 36:38.163
no different than you
growing your stuff.

36:38.164 --> 36:40.832
- I disagree.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.434
You gotta die, there's
no choice there.

36:43.435 --> 36:44.875
- I run a respectable
family business

36:46.137 --> 36:47.697
much like your
parents did, Mr. Bingley.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.447
None of us dipped our
toes in the black market.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.945
- We'll burn 'em.

36:56.815 --> 36:57.815
Burn 'em up.

37:00.686 --> 37:01.686
- All right.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.089
The cremation fee
is $2400 per body.

37:04.090 --> 37:05.370
- You got a two-for-one on that?

37:05.891 --> 37:07.926
- Um, no.

37:14.966 --> 37:18.570
(Wheels clattering)

37:22.274 --> 37:25.877
(Lift buzzing)

37:42.528 --> 37:45.997
- Do you wanna maybe
come over for dinner tonight?

37:46.865 --> 37:49.735
To see marn?

37:50.336 --> 37:51.403
(Clears throat)

37:52.170 --> 37:53.170
Meet the little guy.

37:55.073 --> 37:58.644
- That would be nice.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.512
Thank you.

38:02.247 --> 38:03.247
(Door clattering)

38:37.248 --> 38:40.919
(Phone buzzing)

38:41.820 --> 38:43.755
- [Kim] Frankie, how ya doin'?

38:46.057 --> 38:47.617
- [Frankie] Oh, you
know, i'm stuck deep

38:48.259 --> 38:48.860
inside the asshole
of the country.

38:48.861 --> 38:49.928
I'm swell, hun.

38:50.529 --> 38:51.530
(Kim laughs)

38:53.031 --> 38:54.799
- [Kim] So, look, I tried my
best but we kinda need you

38:54.800 --> 38:58.569
back on Saturday to
shoot the donkey out.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.772
I'm sorry, Frankie.

39:01.407 --> 39:02.508
Frankie?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.355
- That's two days from now, Kim.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.379
The funeral's on Sunday.

39:08.880 --> 39:09.880
- [Kim] Yeah.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.750
Well, I guess it's
Sophie's choice then, hun.

39:11.751 --> 39:13.752
I wish I had better news.

39:15.186 --> 39:15.854
- It's not a Sophie's choice,
my fucking parents died.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.423
- [Kim] I know.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.189
I know, Frankie.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.691
I'm just the messenger here.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.593
I tried to get the
network to consider...

39:21.594 --> 39:22.828
- Can't they push to Monday?

39:23.562 --> 39:25.764
- [Kim] My hands are tied.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.365
I'm sorry.

39:28.133 --> 39:29.173
- So what if I don't show?

39:31.036 --> 39:31.803
What, are they
gonna kill her off?

39:31.804 --> 39:33.104
- [Kim] Maybe, I don't know.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.041
Look, I'm sorry, Frankie.

39:37.476 --> 39:38.809
The same thing happened
to me when I was with...

39:38.810 --> 39:40.045
- Yeah. (Phone beeping)

39:42.047 --> 39:43.482
Fuck, fuck!

39:49.421 --> 39:53.091
(Engine revving)

40:00.699 --> 40:04.503
(Mysterious music)

41:00.225 --> 41:03.795
(Children chattering)

41:32.090 --> 41:35.661
Hey ya, bud.

41:36.427 --> 41:37.427
What are you selling?

41:38.396 --> 41:39.396
- Lemonade.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.131
- Did you make it?

41:41.266 --> 41:43.534
- All by myself.

41:43.535 --> 41:44.535
- May I have a glass?

41:46.337 --> 41:47.337
- Sure.
- How much is it?

41:47.573 --> 41:48.907
- [Jude] For about $2.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.978
- Does this work?

41:53.511 --> 41:54.580
Yeah.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.102
- And you got, so
don't keep the money?

41:58.684 --> 42:00.444
- [Frankie] No, no, that
money's for you now.

42:02.988 --> 42:05.691
Is it good?

42:06.291 --> 42:07.291
- Mm-hmm.

42:09.695 --> 42:10.695
- [Frankie] Thanks, bud.

42:12.698 --> 42:13.938
- I see you met the little man.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.000
- [Frankie] Yeah, he's
quite the entrepreneur.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.069
- Oh yeah.

42:19.304 --> 42:20.171
Oh, buddy, I ought to
be taking financial advice

42:20.172 --> 42:21.573
from you, eh?

42:22.708 --> 42:24.188
Did you meet, do
you know who this is?

42:24.843 --> 42:25.910
- Auntie Frankie, she has
crazy hair, I don't like it!

42:25.911 --> 42:28.546
- (Laughs) You don't like it.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.314
It's growing on me.

42:31.549 --> 42:32.383
You wanna go on
inside to see marnie?

42:32.383 --> 42:33.383
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:33.885 --> 42:34.753
All right, buddy, close up shop.

42:34.753 --> 42:35.753
- Okay, close, everyone!

42:36.888 --> 42:38.368
- [Frankie] Thanks,
glad I caught you.

42:45.597 --> 42:49.267
- Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah!

42:52.203 --> 42:55.774
- Hey.

42:56.341 --> 42:57.341
(Lips smacking)

42:58.509 --> 42:59.845
You remember Frankie?

43:00.646 --> 43:01.713
- Frankie, holy shit!

43:04.149 --> 43:05.250
It's been forever.

43:06.117 --> 43:07.652
Sorry, hands.

43:07.653 --> 43:08.253
- Oh, it's nice to
see you again.

43:08.254 --> 43:10.889
- Yeah, it's been ages.

43:11.657 --> 43:14.091
- [Frankie] Yeah.

43:14.092 --> 43:14.826
- We oughta have some
more people die around here

43:14.826 --> 43:15.727
so you can come more often.

43:15.727 --> 43:16.727
- Oh, come on, marn.

43:16.928 --> 43:17.963
- I brought some wine.

43:19.064 --> 43:20.424
I don't know what
you guys like so.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.633
- [Grayson] I don't
really drink so.

43:23.902 --> 43:25.836
- Well, I sure as heck do.

43:25.837 --> 43:27.272
Crank it open, sister!

43:28.707 --> 43:29.707
- Okay.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.945
- And I'm at the end of my rope.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.313
We're sitting there on
that runway like hour four

43:36.314 --> 43:38.816
or five and we haven't
even taken off yet.

43:38.817 --> 43:40.057
And I'm thinking to myself like

43:41.152 --> 43:42.432
drive the fuckin'
plane, will ya,

43:42.921 --> 43:44.241
please, Mr. Driver,
sir, you know?

43:44.322 --> 43:45.857
- All right.

43:47.058 --> 43:48.092
- No, no, no, I
know, it's a chore.

43:48.093 --> 43:49.573
- Yeah, it's always
a pain in the ass.

43:49.795 --> 43:51.195
Something always
goes wrong, always.

43:51.697 --> 43:53.057
- Yeah, that's why
we don't travel.

43:53.098 --> 43:55.000
- The burgers were
great, thank you.

43:57.268 --> 43:58.668
- [Marnie] Well,
thank you, Frankie.

43:59.738 --> 44:00.571
- And I don't usually
eat red meat so.

44:00.572 --> 44:02.007
- What do you, a vegan?

44:02.841 --> 44:04.121
- No, I'm obviously eating meat.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.179
- I don't know.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.082
You never know
what the west coast

44:12.083 --> 44:13.450
can do to a person
with all the pinko lefties

44:13.451 --> 44:15.291
running around with
their braided arm pit hair,

44:15.921 --> 44:17.464
afraid to eat the honey
from the bees, you know.

44:17.488 --> 44:19.157
- No, I don't know.

44:20.458 --> 44:22.138
- Okay, children, less
politics, more wine.

44:22.393 --> 44:24.896
Gray, do we have
any more of that stuff

44:26.698 --> 44:27.698
that Dougie made, downstairs?

44:27.699 --> 44:29.400
- No, I don't think so.

44:30.836 --> 44:31.803
- [Marine] Frankie, you
want another glass, right?

44:31.804 --> 44:33.044
- Uh, actually.
- Yeah, you want

44:33.471 --> 44:34.239
another one, okay.

44:34.239 --> 44:35.239
(Chuckles)

44:35.774 --> 44:37.408
- She's great.

44:39.978 --> 44:41.498
- Yeah, yeah, she
can really get going.

44:43.281 --> 44:44.881
- So what are you
gonna do with the farm?

44:49.020 --> 44:50.355
- I don't know, I might sell it.

44:54.292 --> 44:56.172
Could use the capital,
get some skin in the game

44:57.328 --> 45:00.331
for that new facility
going up, you know.

45:01.099 --> 45:02.433
- You should do that.

45:03.068 --> 45:04.068
- Yeah.

45:05.771 --> 45:07.171
So you gonna tell
me the real reason

45:07.939 --> 45:09.019
that you came back or what?

45:11.542 --> 45:14.880
- I don't know, to see you.

45:16.081 --> 45:17.881
- Just seems odd, I
haven't seen you in years.

45:18.950 --> 45:20.886
We never talk.

45:21.820 --> 45:22.980
We don't have a relationship.

45:24.355 --> 45:25.395
- No, I know how it seems.

45:25.490 --> 45:27.125
- It seems odd.

45:30.428 --> 45:34.132
- So you're still doing
the acting thing, eh?

45:34.966 --> 45:37.268
- Yeah, I'm chipping away at it.

45:37.969 --> 45:40.038
- That is so cool.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.420
Hey, you should
talk to my niece.

45:46.211 --> 45:47.811
She's been doin' a
lotta like short films

45:50.581 --> 45:52.381
and stuff back out east
with acting, you know.

45:53.018 --> 45:55.787
Really wants to make it big.

45:56.454 --> 45:59.323
- Yeah, sure.

45:59.324 --> 46:00.802
- [Marnie] You
tell her all the tricks

46:00.826 --> 46:02.027
of the trade, you know?

46:02.593 --> 46:03.795
Like shortcuts.

46:04.930 --> 46:06.250
- Yeah, right,
shortcuts. (Laughs)

46:06.932 --> 46:09.334
- I wish we'd seen more of ya.

46:11.569 --> 46:13.404
I like this, ya know.

46:13.872 --> 46:15.273
- Yeah.

46:17.475 --> 46:18.475
- It's great.

46:18.977 --> 46:19.977
- [Grayson] Marn, hun!

46:21.612 --> 46:23.148
This kid's bein' a dick.

46:23.915 --> 46:25.050
- Okay, I'm comin'.

46:28.854 --> 46:32.423
These men, I tell ya.

46:33.424 --> 46:34.424
(Laughing)

46:37.695 --> 46:38.695
Be right back.

46:38.696 --> 46:39.696
(Fire crackling)

46:59.417 --> 47:03.021
- So I went to the
house last night.

47:03.554 --> 47:06.057
- Oh?

47:08.927 --> 47:10.367
- Yeah, I wanted
to see if I could...

47:10.929 --> 47:12.609
You know, if I did
remember the way it was.

47:15.433 --> 47:19.004
- And?

47:20.972 --> 47:22.252
- There's a lot
of shit in there.

47:22.607 --> 47:23.909
(Laughing)

47:24.342 --> 47:25.342
- Yeah.

47:26.644 --> 47:28.644
Yeah, I'm not looking
forward to dealing with that.

47:30.581 --> 47:32.621
- Hey, do you remember
anyone with the name Bennett,

47:34.953 --> 47:38.423
last name Bennett?

47:39.290 --> 47:40.370
- Doesn't ring a bell, why?

47:42.693 --> 47:44.573
- I just, I was, I thought
I remembered someone,

47:45.630 --> 47:49.000
my mom and dad's friends.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.136
- I doubt it.

47:53.972 --> 47:55.039
I know all of mom
and dad's friends.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.975
- You sure about that?

47:57.608 --> 47:58.910
- Yeah, I am.

48:08.019 --> 48:11.589
- Since when do you not drink?

48:12.657 --> 48:14.292
- Since the kid was born.

48:15.927 --> 48:17.462
Yeah.

48:20.365 --> 48:21.365
Yeah, it's good, I guess.

48:23.134 --> 48:25.054
It was just startin' to
get in the way of things.

48:27.172 --> 48:28.172
- It sure did for dad.

48:31.776 --> 48:33.056
- What is that supposed to mean?

48:36.381 --> 48:38.621
- I'm just saying, dad didn't
make the greatest decisions

48:40.618 --> 48:43.354
when he was drinking.

48:43.821 --> 48:45.323
(Laughs)

48:48.093 --> 48:49.527
- Why are you doin' this?

48:50.195 --> 48:51.929
- What, what?

48:53.598 --> 48:55.199
- You just come
back to shit on him or?

48:55.200 --> 48:57.068
'Cause you were a screw up.

48:57.835 --> 48:59.604
- No, I was just...

49:01.339 --> 49:01.906
- Just being disrespectful
because that's nothin' new.

49:01.907 --> 49:05.476
- Excuse me?

49:06.644 --> 49:07.844
- You just think
you're so much better

49:07.845 --> 49:08.845
than everyone, Frankie.

49:09.914 --> 49:10.914
- I don't think I'm fucking
better than anyone, Grayson.

49:10.915 --> 49:13.618
- Frankie knows best.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.186
- Okay, I'm gonna go.

49:19.790 --> 49:20.790
- That's a good idea.

49:21.392 --> 49:22.636
The best idea you've
had in a decade.

49:22.660 --> 49:24.061
- Hey, fuck you!

49:24.062 --> 49:25.102
- Yeah, run away, Frankie.

49:26.597 --> 49:28.099
That's classic stuff.

49:34.939 --> 49:38.643
(Slow tempo rock music)

50:12.810 --> 50:16.381
♪ yeah ♪

50:21.052 --> 50:22.052
♪ yeah ♪

50:36.967 --> 50:40.538
(Loud moaning)

50:51.048 --> 50:54.519
(Water splashing)
(Steam humming)

51:12.203 --> 51:15.706
(Water splashing)

51:37.828 --> 51:41.499
- All right, you guys
have to really do it there.

51:42.433 --> 51:43.593
What you're gonna have to do,

51:44.335 --> 51:45.869
you're using here
'cause it's gonna

51:45.870 --> 51:47.137
have a direct correlation
to how this piston functions.

51:47.138 --> 51:50.107
So all that
information should be

51:51.008 --> 51:52.088
in page 22 of your manuals.

51:52.243 --> 51:54.245
(Knocking)

51:54.979 --> 51:56.480
Make sure you, uh.

51:56.481 --> 51:58.521
Make sure you read that
clearly because that's gonna

51:59.684 --> 52:01.244
help you understand
this entire machine.

52:01.952 --> 52:04.255
(Students chattering)

52:05.690 --> 52:07.570
Frankie Bingley, did not
expect to see you here.

52:10.228 --> 52:12.663
- Yeah, well, here I am.

52:13.664 --> 52:14.665
- So what's?

52:17.835 --> 52:18.835
What's going on?

52:20.805 --> 52:21.805
(Chuckles)

52:25.109 --> 52:26.176
- I kinda need a favor.

52:26.177 --> 52:27.278
- Okay, what do you need?

52:29.680 --> 52:31.440
- If I tell you, you're
not gonna wanna do it

52:31.649 --> 52:32.889
so will you meet me after work?

52:33.017 --> 52:35.653
Bankview motel?

52:36.086 --> 52:37.154
- Okay.

52:38.055 --> 52:39.175
Do I need to bring anything?

52:40.691 --> 52:41.691
- Just yourself.

52:44.529 --> 52:48.266
- You're an odd
one, Frankie Bingley.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.569
- No, king, Frankie king.

52:52.303 --> 52:53.804
I changed my name.

52:54.372 --> 52:55.406
(Chuckles)

52:58.709 --> 53:00.389
- [Grayson] Hey,
Frankie, I just wanted to,

53:05.516 --> 53:07.196
I didn't mean to make
you upset last night.

53:10.521 --> 53:12.657
I've just been a little
outta sorts lately and, uh.

53:13.524 --> 53:16.494
(Queen Berry laughing on TV)

53:17.662 --> 53:18.496
Anyhow, we're all gonna
be at the house tomorrow

53:18.497 --> 53:20.665
so come on by if you want.

53:21.232 --> 53:22.867
Okay, bye.

53:26.404 --> 53:27.972
- [Bruce] So like
this way or this way?

53:29.106 --> 53:30.116
- Horizontal, it looks better.

53:30.140 --> 53:31.576
- Okay.

53:32.443 --> 53:33.443
- Bruce, can you hear me?

53:34.479 --> 53:35.556
- Yeah, it's comin'
through good.

53:35.580 --> 53:36.381
- Can you hear me, Bruce?

53:36.382 --> 53:37.914
- Yup, still hear you.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.595
- To record just press
the round red button

53:40.685 --> 53:41.965
at the bar.
- Thanks, I've used a

53:42.219 --> 53:43.787
cell phone before.

53:43.788 --> 53:45.154
- Okay, sorry, my brother
still has a flip phone.

53:45.155 --> 53:47.858
- [Bruce] All right,
ready when you are.

53:50.595 --> 53:51.875
- Frankie king
with Blaze talent.

53:55.533 --> 53:57.173
I'm 5'9 and reading
for the role of Livia.

54:01.138 --> 54:04.742
So how'd you find me?

54:06.176 --> 54:07.077
- [Bruce] It wasn't
hard, he's a terrible liar.

54:07.078 --> 54:09.380
- Yeah, I guess.

54:10.281 --> 54:11.615
Your whole marriage is a lie.

54:11.616 --> 54:13.551
- You think he
actually loves you?

54:14.319 --> 54:15.553
He doesn't love you.

54:16.721 --> 54:17.998
- He's planning on
leaving you, Terry.

54:18.022 --> 54:19.824
It's over.

54:20.658 --> 54:21.658
Believe what you want.

54:24.629 --> 54:26.629
You think he's playing
soccer every Thursday night?

54:26.731 --> 54:30.967
No.

54:30.968 --> 54:32.448
He's making love to
me every Thursday.

54:32.837 --> 54:34.605
(Inhaling)

54:37.141 --> 54:38.042
That's icky, okay, cut.

54:38.043 --> 54:39.577
Okay, I think we got it.

54:40.244 --> 54:41.478
- That's it?

54:41.479 --> 54:42.746
- Yeah, it's easy, right?

54:42.747 --> 54:43.980
- You don't wanna
do another one?

54:43.981 --> 54:45.616
- Do you think I
should do another one?

54:48.018 --> 54:49.285
- Well, I mean, there
was a bump in the middle.

54:49.286 --> 54:50.726
I feel like I can
do it a bit better.

54:50.755 --> 54:52.357
- You think you
can do a little better?

54:53.057 --> 54:54.057
- Yeah, if we can.

54:54.459 --> 54:55.459
- Okay, you got it.

54:56.794 --> 54:57.794
- All right.

54:57.795 --> 54:58.563
- From the top.

54:58.563 --> 54:59.563
(Frankie clears throat)

55:02.867 --> 55:04.133
- [Announcer] Remember
friends, I want you to hang around.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.569
Coming up in the second
half, the toughest eight seconds

55:05.570 --> 55:07.605
on earth right here in bankview.

55:08.773 --> 55:10.093
We're glad you're
with us on this,

55:11.108 --> 55:13.228
another fabulous rodeo
weekend right here in bankview.

55:15.380 --> 55:17.047
(People chattering)

55:20.551 --> 55:22.085
- [Frankie voiceover] I
never woulda thought

55:22.086 --> 55:22.787
in a million years I'd end
up at a rodeo in bankview

55:22.788 --> 55:24.722
with my high school boyfriend.

55:25.490 --> 55:27.758
- [Bruce voiceover] Never?

55:29.126 --> 55:30.860
- [Frankie voiceover]
No never, ever, ever.

55:30.861 --> 55:34.764
It fucking reeks in
here like animal shit.

55:34.765 --> 55:37.602
- [Bruce] Well, I don't
smell a thing, city girl.

55:38.469 --> 55:40.605
- So you never got married?

55:41.706 --> 55:43.106
- No, I got close
a couple times but

55:44.041 --> 55:46.043
just didn't feel right.

55:48.513 --> 55:49.747
I take it neither did you?

55:52.650 --> 55:53.984
- Well, I am actually.

55:55.386 --> 55:56.754
- Oh.

55:58.956 --> 56:00.089
- Yeah, I've been
meaning to tell you.

56:00.090 --> 56:02.427
- Ah ha, fuckin' actor.

56:04.361 --> 56:06.130
(Frankie laughs)

56:07.598 --> 56:09.358
- No, I don't think it's
in the cards for me.

56:12.403 --> 56:15.973
- [Announcer] Well, bayview,
another great rodeo ride.

56:17.442 --> 56:19.443
Now it's time to go
to shoot number four

56:19.444 --> 56:21.221
as we get ready for one
of the top bronc riders

56:21.245 --> 56:22.880
we have in our game.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.582
He's gonna measure
that bronc rein

56:25.583 --> 56:26.916
all the way back to
the front of the saddle.

56:26.917 --> 56:28.197
After that, we're
gonna come out.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.665
He nods his head and away we go!

56:30.387 --> 56:32.022
(Upbeat country music)

56:33.090 --> 56:35.526
How about that, bankview?

56:37.394 --> 56:38.674
Another great saddle bronc ride.

56:40.465 --> 56:44.134
As we call in the
pick up men to rein in

56:45.235 --> 56:46.504
that beautiful palomino pony,

56:48.072 --> 56:49.439
another one of the four-legged
superstars from our game.

56:49.440 --> 56:51.876
This should be a bunch of fun

56:52.943 --> 56:53.678
as we get ready
to ride another one.

56:53.679 --> 56:56.013
(People chattering)

56:57.515 --> 56:58.449
- I work with a donkey
on the kid's show.

56:58.450 --> 57:00.618
It's got nothin' on these.

57:01.285 --> 57:02.285
(Bruce laughs)

57:02.987 --> 57:04.889
This is fun.

57:05.623 --> 57:06.623
- [Bruce] Thank god.

57:08.626 --> 57:09.759
- [Frankie voiceover]
Okay, don't get me wrong.

57:09.760 --> 57:11.160
This is a really country
experience, but it's kinda fun.

57:11.161 --> 57:14.031
- [Bruce voiceover] Well,
you're country, Frankie.

57:15.232 --> 57:16.601
Down those guts.

57:17.468 --> 57:18.748
- [Frankie voiceover] So, I, uh.

57:21.539 --> 57:23.299
I think I just find out
that I have a sister.

57:26.176 --> 57:28.078
- [Bruce voiceover] Oh?

57:31.215 --> 57:32.049
- [Frankie voiceover]
Yeah, I don't know.

57:32.050 --> 57:34.752
- Whoa, how's that?

57:35.385 --> 57:36.587
- My dad.

57:39.557 --> 57:41.077
It was a secret he
didn't tell anybody.

57:42.593 --> 57:44.033
I don't know, part
of me's interested

57:46.731 --> 57:48.533
in this girl, you know?

57:49.433 --> 57:50.501
- Wow.

57:55.072 --> 57:55.606
You share blood,
that's the thing.

57:55.607 --> 57:57.942
It's undeniable.

58:01.078 --> 58:04.782
- Yeah.

58:05.382 --> 58:06.382
Yeah, it is.

58:08.418 --> 58:09.418
(Gentle country music)

58:25.536 --> 58:29.239
(Train horns blowing distantly)

58:49.594 --> 58:53.297
(Motor humming)

58:54.164 --> 58:55.164
- Here we go.

58:58.468 --> 59:02.106
- Thank you, that was more
fun than I thought it would be.

59:02.707 --> 59:05.009
(Bruce chuckles)

59:05.910 --> 59:07.712
- Well, that's a great review.

59:08.846 --> 59:10.290
- You know I didn't
mean it like that.

59:10.314 --> 59:12.082
- I know.

59:21.592 --> 59:25.195
- Hey, um.

59:27.464 --> 59:31.135
I'm sorry about the way
that things ended between us.

59:36.974 --> 59:40.210
- You got nothing to
be sorry about, Frankie.

59:51.521 --> 59:55.192
- Are you coming to the funeral?

59:55.826 --> 59:58.062
- I'll be there.

1:00:09.273 --> 1:00:12.977
(Motor humming)

1:00:21.786 --> 1:00:25.690
(Motor humming)

1:00:26.791 --> 1:00:27.957
- Hey, did that make
you dick bigger?

1:00:27.958 --> 1:00:29.393
I'm speeding, you
fucking asshole!

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:32.830
(Phone buzzing)

1:00:33.497 --> 1:00:35.700
Hey, penny.

1:00:36.934 --> 1:00:37.802
- [Penny] Frankie,
how are you doing?

1:00:37.803 --> 1:00:42.038
- I'm okay, getting by.

1:00:42.039 --> 1:00:43.539
- [Penny] Thanks for sending
that self tape for the soap.

1:00:43.540 --> 1:00:44.785
- The script was
fucking terrible.

1:00:44.809 --> 1:00:46.376
- [Penny] Yeah.

1:00:47.778 --> 1:00:48.578
Hey, look, I have the
Berry producers on my ass.

1:00:48.579 --> 1:00:50.981
- Yeah, I talked to Kim.

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:53.589
- [Penny] They're
being unreasonable.

1:00:54.384 --> 1:00:55.551
I'm trying to tell them both
her parents fucking died.

1:00:55.552 --> 1:00:57.432
That's why you have
production insurance, hello.

1:00:57.688 --> 1:00:59.724
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

1:01:00.290 --> 1:01:01.290
- [Penny] Well.

1:01:02.626 --> 1:01:04.093
I negotiated and
got you until Monday.

1:01:04.094 --> 1:01:06.230
- I don't think I
give a fuck, penny.

1:01:06.964 --> 1:01:08.699
- [Penny] Frankie.

1:01:09.934 --> 1:01:11.000
- I don't wanna go
back to that shitty set.

1:01:11.001 --> 1:01:12.441
- [Penny] We can
talk about this more

1:01:13.137 --> 1:01:13.437
when you get back
on Monday, 'Kay?

1:01:13.438 --> 1:01:15.973
Monday?

1:01:16.473 --> 1:01:17.473
Frankie?

1:01:20.878 --> 1:01:21.878
Finish the season out.

1:01:23.213 --> 1:01:24.281
- Yeah, yeah.

1:01:26.016 --> 1:01:27.016
- [Penny] All right, hun.

1:01:27.484 --> 1:01:28.484
Safe travels.

1:01:29.253 --> 1:01:30.319
- Thanks.

1:02:02.419 --> 1:02:06.123
Can I help you?

1:02:07.457 --> 1:02:08.977
- I'm Frankie Bingley,
iain's daughter.

1:02:12.797 --> 1:02:16.233
- Yeah, uh.

1:02:18.268 --> 1:02:19.268
I'm not sure who
you're talking about.

1:02:19.269 --> 1:02:21.471
I'm sorry.
- He's dead.

1:02:28.412 --> 1:02:32.016
Can we talk?

1:02:35.319 --> 1:02:39.023
- I'm not quite sure
why you're here, Frankie.

1:02:40.624 --> 1:02:42.960
- I have a half-sister.

1:02:45.695 --> 1:02:46.695
- Yeah.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:51.100
How'd you find me?

1:02:54.271 --> 1:02:55.351
- I found the money orders.

1:02:57.607 --> 1:02:59.327
- Well, I was young
and I made a mistake so.

1:03:02.312 --> 1:03:04.248
- I am not here to judge you.

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:06.050
- No?

1:03:06.984 --> 1:03:08.144
What are you doing here then?

1:03:11.355 --> 1:03:14.859
Okay, you know
what, I can't do this.

1:03:16.126 --> 1:03:17.646
- I'm sorry, I never
shoulda come here.

1:03:20.497 --> 1:03:24.168
- Wait.

1:03:24.701 --> 1:03:25.701
Wait.

1:03:29.106 --> 1:03:32.910
Do you want some coffee?

1:03:34.011 --> 1:03:35.331
We met at a
convention in Montana.

1:03:36.380 --> 1:03:37.900
I was working for a
wind power company.

1:03:38.048 --> 1:03:40.184
You know, these conventions.

1:03:41.285 --> 1:03:42.605
A lotta parties,
a lotta drinking.

1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:46.290
And we were at the same hotel.

1:03:47.191 --> 1:03:49.559
He was really easy to talk to.

1:03:50.895 --> 1:03:52.375
And I remember
when he smiled at me I,

1:03:55.499 --> 1:03:57.601
I felt like it was
genuine, it was warm.

1:04:00.037 --> 1:04:01.317
I was pretty lonely at the time.

1:04:04.774 --> 1:04:07.044
My parents lived back east.

1:04:10.214 --> 1:04:13.183
- Did you know he was married?

1:04:17.687 --> 1:04:21.291
- We never talked about that.

1:04:23.527 --> 1:04:25.447
Anyway, he wanted to
cut ties and I was pregnant.

1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:31.368
- I'm sorry.

1:04:34.471 --> 1:04:35.471
- No, don't be.

1:04:37.107 --> 1:04:38.267
It's not your fault. (Laughs)

1:04:38.976 --> 1:04:41.445
Yeah, I've spent a lot of time

1:04:42.646 --> 1:04:43.080
with a lotta shitty
men in my life.

1:04:43.080 --> 1:04:44.080
(Laughing)

1:04:44.681 --> 1:04:46.150
- What'd you tell Julia?

1:04:49.653 --> 1:04:51.573
- I told her that I got
drunk and I got pregnant.

1:04:52.622 --> 1:04:55.392
And that her father wanted
nothing to do with her.

1:04:57.827 --> 1:04:59.596
- That's sad.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:04.146
- I mean, I have a
beautiful daughter.

1:05:06.270 --> 1:05:07.972
Healthy.

1:05:08.705 --> 1:05:09.705
And we trust each other.

1:05:16.746 --> 1:05:20.317
- I didn't know my parents.

1:05:22.719 --> 1:05:24.239
I wasn't into the
farm or the church or

1:05:27.124 --> 1:05:29.559
the things my family were into.

1:05:31.861 --> 1:05:33.630
I liked boys and sex and music.

1:05:40.237 --> 1:05:43.707
I cut them out and
they cut me out.

1:05:47.344 --> 1:05:50.981
But now.

1:05:54.551 --> 1:05:58.222
I'm really not here to
fuck anything up for you

1:05:58.955 --> 1:06:00.324
or your daughter.

1:06:03.427 --> 1:06:07.064
I just wanted to let
you know that Julia

1:06:08.332 --> 1:06:10.734
is named as beneficiary
on a half a million dollar

1:06:11.701 --> 1:06:14.204
life insurance policy.

1:06:15.005 --> 1:06:16.106
- Wha?

1:06:23.013 --> 1:06:26.616
- You didn't know?

1:06:30.720 --> 1:06:34.324
Yeah, well, it's all there.

1:06:46.836 --> 1:06:50.374
- Thank you, Frankie.

1:07:05.255 --> 1:07:09.059
(Soft country music)

1:07:27.277 --> 1:07:31.148
(Espresso machine humming)

1:07:51.735 --> 1:07:55.339
- Frankie?

1:08:05.149 --> 1:08:08.718
(Doorbell chiming)

1:08:14.424 --> 1:08:18.228
(Soft country music)

1:08:36.646 --> 1:08:40.250
(Sniffling)

1:09:17.086 --> 1:09:20.690
- Hey.

1:09:21.225 --> 1:09:22.225
- Hi.

1:09:23.693 --> 1:09:25.027
- [Grayson] You're here
to give us a hand or?

1:09:25.028 --> 1:09:26.930
- What, you're not done yet?

1:09:27.897 --> 1:09:28.897
- [Grayson] Yeah.

1:09:32.736 --> 1:09:36.306
(Gentle music)

1:09:49.018 --> 1:09:52.589
(Jude mutters)

1:09:53.723 --> 1:09:55.203
- [Marnie] In the
grass or in the air.

1:09:55.392 --> 1:09:57.561
- Wanna do this
throw, count of three?

1:09:58.728 --> 1:10:00.196
One, two, three,
whoa, nice throw!

1:10:00.764 --> 1:10:02.899
Okay, high five.

1:10:10.206 --> 1:10:13.677
- Once we get to
the bottom there,

1:10:14.611 --> 1:10:15.111
can I give this to you, honey?

1:10:15.112 --> 1:10:16.613
- Yeah.

1:10:17.714 --> 1:10:19.549
- Oh shit!
- Watch your foot.

1:10:20.317 --> 1:10:22.652
You got it now?
- What?

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:24.800
- You got it now?
- Kind of.

1:10:30.394 --> 1:10:33.863
Hey, I'm sorry
about running away

1:10:35.198 --> 1:10:36.766
without saying
goodbye the other night.

1:10:38.902 --> 1:10:40.622
- Lady, don't even
worry about it, I get it.

1:10:40.937 --> 1:10:44.408
I'm married to him.

1:10:44.974 --> 1:10:46.009
(Laughing)

1:10:48.011 --> 1:10:49.646
- It's not him.

1:10:56.786 --> 1:11:00.457
- You know I've
got five siblings.

1:11:01.291 --> 1:11:02.959
- Oh my god.
- Yeah.

1:11:04.227 --> 1:11:05.267
- Do y'all get along?
- No.

1:11:05.862 --> 1:11:06.862
No, no, no, no. (Laughs)

1:11:07.364 --> 1:11:09.699
That's family though.

1:11:11.635 --> 1:11:12.802
- Do you keep in touch?

1:11:15.872 --> 1:11:16.872
- When we can.

1:11:18.174 --> 1:11:19.894
I mean, I've got nine
nieces and nephews so.

1:11:20.877 --> 1:11:23.413
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:11:24.614 --> 1:11:26.316
- (Laughs) That would
be insane hard work.

1:11:29.152 --> 1:11:30.663
- It is, yeah, it is.
- Keeping track of them all.

1:11:30.687 --> 1:11:32.456
- It is hard work. (Laughs)

1:11:33.357 --> 1:11:36.292
But it's good work, you know?

1:11:37.761 --> 1:11:39.563
In the end.

1:11:52.476 --> 1:11:56.312
(Jude squealing)

1:11:57.514 --> 1:11:58.982
(Gentle music)

1:12:01.851 --> 1:12:02.851
(Laughing)

1:12:03.753 --> 1:12:04.421
- [Man] It's just
a matter of time.

1:12:04.421 --> 1:12:05.421
(Guests chattering)

1:12:06.490 --> 1:12:07.823
- I know that.
- At least the kids know.

1:12:07.824 --> 1:12:09.057
- [Marnie] Jude, honey,
why don't you come and sit.

1:12:09.058 --> 1:12:10.058
Thank you, honey.

1:12:10.694 --> 1:12:11.694
- [Man] Ooh, thank you.

1:12:14.864 --> 1:12:15.699
- Do want a hot dog or do
you just want your apple?

1:12:15.700 --> 1:12:17.000
- I just want a hot dog.

1:12:17.767 --> 1:12:18.968
- Hot dog?

1:12:19.703 --> 1:12:21.069
(Family chattering)

1:12:21.070 --> 1:12:23.238
What do you want, do you
want ketchup or mustard?

1:12:23.239 --> 1:12:25.040
- Start 'em young here.
- Probably should get it done.

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:26.786
- When are you gonna
start moving, around six?

1:12:26.810 --> 1:12:28.290
- I'm just gonna
chill as soon as Doug

1:12:29.345 --> 1:12:30.779
can hand me something.
- He's been doing everything,

1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:32.425
absolutely everything.
- Not the only person

1:12:32.449 --> 1:12:33.316
in this family who lies.

1:12:33.316 --> 1:12:34.316
(Laughing)

1:12:35.084 --> 1:12:36.119
- [Frankie] Oh, snap.

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:38.420
- [Marnie] Bad joke, bad joke.

1:12:38.555 --> 1:12:39.555
- Oh, well said.

1:12:40.223 --> 1:12:41.223
- [Marnie] Too soon.

1:12:41.591 --> 1:12:42.591
(People chattering)

1:12:43.326 --> 1:12:45.462
- This is gonna take years.

1:12:48.197 --> 1:12:49.717
- Makes me wish I
never owned anything.

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:51.968
- I'm goin' home
right after this,

1:12:53.169 --> 1:12:54.770
and I'm throwin' out
everything in my basement.

1:12:54.771 --> 1:12:56.971
Yeah, it's just gonna be
someone else's problem one day.

1:13:04.714 --> 1:13:08.552
I remember buying this
for dad, for father's day.

1:13:14.157 --> 1:13:16.826
I was like 11 or 12, and
this was the first gift I ever

1:13:19.796 --> 1:13:21.598
bought him with my own money.

1:13:24.968 --> 1:13:26.808
We spent like half an
hour in the thrift store,

1:13:29.105 --> 1:13:30.674
and this is what I picked.

1:13:32.976 --> 1:13:35.296
I don't think I ever saw dad
where a tie a day in his life,

1:13:37.814 --> 1:13:40.750
but I thought he'd
really like this.

1:13:42.552 --> 1:13:43.912
I thought I got a
really good gift.

1:13:54.330 --> 1:13:57.867
Still in the box.

1:14:00.436 --> 1:14:04.040
Adios, dad.

1:14:11.214 --> 1:14:14.784
(Gentle music)

1:14:39.308 --> 1:14:42.946
- We are gathered here
today to celebrate the lives

1:14:43.813 --> 1:14:45.048
of Anna and iain Bingley.

1:14:46.516 --> 1:14:48.036
And the unexpected
loss of a loved one,

1:14:48.885 --> 1:14:51.487
a neighbor, a friend.

1:14:52.989 --> 1:14:55.149
Well, it brings us face to
face with our own mortality,

1:14:55.258 --> 1:14:57.193
how fleeting life can be.

1:14:58.327 --> 1:14:59.529
And when cut short by tragedy,

1:15:01.831 --> 1:15:03.391
we are left with how
to grapple with how

1:15:03.767 --> 1:15:05.635
to make sense of it all.

1:15:06.502 --> 1:15:08.037
And we may shake our fist at god

1:15:09.172 --> 1:15:10.807
or bow our heads
in defeat and despair.

1:15:13.276 --> 1:15:15.178
But, brothers and
sisters, as the apostle Paul

1:15:18.214 --> 1:15:22.718
wrote in the epistle
of the thessalonians.

1:15:22.719 --> 1:15:25.054
We do not want
you to be uninformed

1:15:27.323 --> 1:15:28.524
about those who sleep in death

1:15:29.659 --> 1:15:31.628
so that you do not
grieve like the rest

1:15:32.528 --> 1:15:33.697
of mankind who have no hope.

1:15:35.098 --> 1:15:36.898
For we believe that
Jesus died and Rose again,

1:15:39.068 --> 1:15:41.671
and so we believe
that god will bring

1:15:43.139 --> 1:15:44.979
with Jesus those who
have fallen asleep in him.

1:15:47.276 --> 1:15:48.276
So.

1:15:51.715 --> 1:15:52.835
Anna and iain are now safely

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:57.952
in the loving
embrace of our savior.

1:16:01.324 --> 1:16:03.226
Let us bow our heads.

1:16:06.429 --> 1:16:08.429
Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name,

1:16:09.999 --> 1:16:12.902
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

1:16:13.770 --> 1:16:16.172
on earth as it is in heaven.

1:16:17.707 --> 1:16:19.467
- I just want to thank
all of you for coming.

1:16:25.081 --> 1:16:28.117
I know that mom and dad
are looking down on us and

1:16:33.990 --> 1:16:36.225
Mom's probably saying how
much she likes the flowers so.

1:16:39.062 --> 1:16:41.030
And, uh.

1:16:43.566 --> 1:16:44.566
Excuse me.

1:17:01.217 --> 1:17:04.788
- I think what my
brother is trying to say is

1:17:06.155 --> 1:17:09.058
it means the world to us
that all of you are here today,

1:17:09.759 --> 1:17:12.696
to our family.

1:17:16.866 --> 1:17:20.336
Most of you don't know
me very well anymore.

1:17:21.437 --> 1:17:24.674
I follow scripts for a living,

1:17:25.842 --> 1:17:26.642
and I really wish I had
one right now. (Laughs)

1:17:26.643 --> 1:17:30.213
But I don't.

1:17:32.816 --> 1:17:36.319
It's really nice to
see all your faces.

1:17:39.555 --> 1:17:40.555
Are you good?

1:17:43.559 --> 1:17:44.928
- Yeah.

1:17:46.696 --> 1:17:49.933
Oh, thank you and god bless.

1:17:52.969 --> 1:17:56.339
(Mourners chattering)

1:17:57.173 --> 1:18:00.109
(Gentle music)

1:18:48.591 --> 1:18:52.295
So, uh.

1:18:54.463 --> 1:18:56.264
We're actually having some
people around the house

1:18:56.265 --> 1:18:58.301
in a little bit if
you wanna come.

1:19:01.037 --> 1:19:02.517
- I actually have
to go unfortunately.

1:19:05.674 --> 1:19:08.011
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

1:19:11.815 --> 1:19:15.484
Well, don't be a stranger.

1:19:18.354 --> 1:19:21.524
- I won't.

1:19:26.963 --> 1:19:30.766
(Somber music)

1:20:25.054 --> 1:20:28.557
(Water splashing)

1:20:42.038 --> 1:20:45.541
(Water splashing)

1:20:49.712 --> 1:20:53.182
(Toilet flushing)

1:21:10.533 --> 1:21:14.137
(Gentle music)

1:21:32.956 --> 1:21:36.459
(Water splashing)

1:22:02.551 --> 1:22:06.022
(Crew chattering)

1:22:21.670 --> 1:22:25.308
- [Assistant director]
