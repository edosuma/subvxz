WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.628
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:02.753 --> 00:04.797
Looks like the House is gonna pass
the gun-control bill.

00:04.922 --> 00:06.090
Speaker Hookstraten came through.

00:06.215 --> 00:09.135
Now, I may be new to the Hill,
but so is everybody else.

00:09.260 --> 00:11.387
You're the last of the old guard
around here, Madam Speaker.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.556
So get on board... or step aside.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.392
There is a connection
between MacLeish and Lozano.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.812
And this FBI Agent,
Hannah Wells, was onto it.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.732
<i>You're interested in Nestor Lozano.
So are we.</i>

00:22.857 --> 00:24.108
You got my attention.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.652
Someone is feeding Abe Leonard
classified information,

00:26.777 --> 00:28.279
and we need to find out who.

00:28.404 --> 00:31.615
This is a manifesto, Jason.
"Pax Americana; an American empire

00:31.741 --> 00:33.868
to replace our own
constitutional government."

00:37.788 --> 00:39.957
Oh, my God. It's Lozano.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.423
It can't be.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.176
Lozano's dead. Let me see that.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.395
- Tree line!
- Go, go, go!

01:09.278 --> 01:12.239
Don't let them get away!

01:31.509 --> 01:33.511
Oh, forget this.

01:38.933 --> 01:41.143
I thought we said 11:00.
It's almost 2:00.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.062
<i>Just testing your resolve.</i>

01:43.187 --> 01:45.898
<i>Three whole hours...
is that all the truth is worth to you?</i>

01:46.023 --> 01:48.400
Is that what you're gonna give me,
the truth?

01:48.526 --> 01:51.529
<i>Tip I gave you on Hannah Wells paid off,
didn't it?</i>

01:53.030 --> 01:54.740
All right, what do you got for me now?

01:54.865 --> 01:57.493
<i>- Another piece of the puzzle.</i>
- Why not the whole thing?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.162
<i>That's not how this works.
I'm not on the record here.</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:03.749
<i>You need to find the story yourself,
and I need to know I can trust you.</i>

02:03.874 --> 02:06.585
You got to be kidding me.
I've never burned a source in my life.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.713
I lost my job at the <i>Herald</i>
'cause I wouldn't give up my sources.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.716
<i>The White House
is covering up the truth.</i>

02:13.717 --> 02:16.720
- Truth about what?
<i>- The Capitol bombing.</i>

02:17.555 --> 02:21.350
<i>Hannah Wells' boss was the last person
to see Majid Nassar alive.</i>

02:21.725 --> 02:24.395
<i>Jason Atwood, check him out.</i>

02:24.854 --> 02:26.230
Wait, wait.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.751
How the hell is Lozano still alive?

02:50.754 --> 02:52.756
Jason, are you hit?

02:52.882 --> 02:55.301
Oh, God. I got to get you to a hospital.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.261
- No, it can wait.
- Damn it.

03:09.940 --> 03:13.068
<i>Today marks a milestone
for the Kirkman Administration</i>

03:13.194 --> 03:15.446
<i>as he signs
his gun-control bill into law,</i>

03:15.571 --> 03:18.949
<i>igniting hopes that this unelected,
independent president</i>

03:19.074 --> 03:23.162
<i>can actually break the partisan gridlock
that's paralyzed Congress for years.</i>

03:23.287 --> 03:25.122
<i>There's another big winner today:</i>

03:25.247 --> 03:26.498
<i>Speaker of the House Hookstraten,</i>

03:26.624 --> 03:28.918
<i>the moderate Republican
who went out on a limb</i>

03:29.043 --> 03:30.836
<i>supporting the White House on this.</i>

03:30.961 --> 03:34.340
<i>These two have got to be feeling good
this morning.</i>

03:34.465 --> 03:38.093
Madam Speaker, this could not have been
accomplished without you.

03:38.219 --> 03:40.471
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

03:46.143 --> 03:47.978
I don't think my hand
has shaken this much

03:48.103 --> 03:51.232
since I signed my first mortgage.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.286
No dice.

04:05.788 --> 04:07.164
What do you mean?

04:07.289 --> 04:09.458
The plate's from a White House
pool of vehicles.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.377
White House?

04:11.502 --> 04:14.088
- You're sure?
- That's what it says.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.966
- I need to get a name.
- Hundreds of people work there.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.345
- Any one of them could have accessed it.
- Hey, I paid you to get a name.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.097
You paid me to run a plate.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.057
Oh, come on.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.392
Wh...

04:26.517 --> 04:28.018
I should at least get a discount!

04:31.689 --> 04:33.107
White House.

04:37.695 --> 04:38.570
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.156
- Hey, hey! Big win today!
- Yeah, for all of us.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.826
Yeah, we're trending.
#GunControlWins.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.328
We get you back
in the West Wing with the new VP?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.871
- Ask her.
- What is it?

04:48.831 --> 04:50.874
- No comment.
- No comment necessary.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.586
The speaker swung the vote for POTUS,
creating a true bipartisan alliance.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.422
No. Tri-partisan alliance.

04:56.547 --> 04:58.382
You had Democrats, moderate
Republicans, and Independents.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.342
I stand corrected;
a true tri-partisan alliance.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.429
Now, who wouldn't want to keep that going
with Hookstraten as VP?

05:03.554 --> 05:05.556
Well, the polls are in.
America wants this.

05:05.681 --> 05:07.725
And the president will make up his mind
when he's ready.

05:07.850 --> 05:09.601
Yeah, but what's your opinion, really?

05:09.727 --> 05:11.937
Hookstraten said she'd deliver the vote,
and she did.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.480
That's it?

05:13.897 --> 05:16.400
- You find that evasive? I find it evasive.
- Absolutely.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.027
That's evasive.
I want a straight answer.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.945
Look, we all know
that the relationship

05:20.070 --> 05:22.072
between POTUS and the Speaker
hasn't always been easy.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.782
He's a consensus builder,
and she's a--

05:23.907 --> 05:26.243
- Hey, watch it.
- Bulldog is what I was gonna say.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.954
- That's fair.
- Yeah, but Kirkman needs a bulldog,

05:29.079 --> 05:31.123
especially one who controls a majority
in the House.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.625
He needs allies, but he also needs
someone he can trust.

05:33.751 --> 05:36.128
Mm, so you're saying
you don't find her to be trustworthy.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.963
Okay, what is this?
A press conference?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.632
I am enjoying being on the other side
of the podium for once.

05:40.758 --> 05:41.759
Of course you are.

05:41.884 --> 05:44.970
All I'm saying is that she's a politician
and he's not.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.223
- Well, opposites attract.
- Sometimes.

05:50.601 --> 05:54.563
I have to be honest... when I first
took office, I had my doubts.

05:54.938 --> 05:58.067
I didn't know if I could trust you,
and I knew you didn't trust me.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.943
I trusted you were doing your best.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.320
I believe that.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.823
Well, let's just say you didn't have
a lot of faith in what my best could be.

06:04.948 --> 06:07.117
Oh, you were an unknown quantity,
Mr. President.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.787
I just wanted to make sure
the best interests of the country

06:09.912 --> 06:11.955
- were being protected.
- I know.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.291
I hope I passed the test.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.585
I hope I did.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.254
We have a lot of momentum right now.

06:19.380 --> 06:22.591
Together, as a team, we managed to cross
the bipartisan divide for the bill.

06:22.716 --> 06:26.470
You did your job quickly and efficiently.
I was really impressed.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.848
I have sharp elbows when I'm fighting
for something I believe in.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.184
Well, we can certainly use
your sharp elbows

06:32.309 --> 06:34.311
when rolling out
our new legislative agenda.

06:35.312 --> 06:38.315
But, Kimble...
well, I think we've got a chance

06:38.440 --> 06:40.192
to do something really special here...

06:40.317 --> 06:42.236
beyond policy.

06:43.153 --> 06:46.031
I would like my daughter to see a woman

06:46.156 --> 06:48.450
become vice president
of the United States.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.453
Sir...

06:51.578 --> 06:52.996
so would I.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.208
Good. We'll start
the formal vetting process.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.002
As soon as you clear that,
we'll make a public statement.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.297
- I'm excited for both of us.
- Thank you, sir.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.007
No, thank you. Come on.

07:06.427 --> 07:09.888
<i>Today's legislation deals a serious blow
to Senator Jack Bowman,</i>

07:10.013 --> 07:12.808
<i>who clearly underestimated
the president's ability</i>

07:12.933 --> 07:15.853
<i>to build a successful coalition
in the House of Representatives--</i>

07:15.978 --> 07:18.856
Senator, Liam Price to see you.

07:18.981 --> 07:20.023
Send him in.

07:20.691 --> 07:23.485
Senator, I know what
a busy schedule you have.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.822
May I also say how much I admired
your stance on the gun-control bill.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.031
You said you have something for me?

07:45.716 --> 07:47.176
Close the door.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.603
And you're sure it was him?

07:57.728 --> 07:58.937
Yeah, it was him.

07:59.062 --> 08:03.025
From one sighting, at 130 yards out,
through a night-vision scope?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.611
I know what I saw.
Atwood saw him, too.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.862
Where is Atwood?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.780
He's recovering.
He took a round in his arm.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.949
What about Lozano?
Did you track the helicopter?

08:11.074 --> 08:12.743
Tail number was blacked out.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.204
And there's no FAA air-traffic control
in the area.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.040
- It's like he flew into a vacuum.
- Did we secure the munitions, at least?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.751
Yeah, the task force was on the ground
two hours after Hannah called it in.

08:20.876 --> 08:23.045
They secured the silo,
but everyone was gone.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.884
So, if Lozano's alive,
then who did the FBI take down

08:29.009 --> 08:30.761
after the attempt on the president?

08:38.769 --> 08:40.354
Here's your boy.

08:41.772 --> 08:44.399
Crime report said
he was holding a grenade.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.443
What did the shrapnel tell you?

08:46.568 --> 08:50.113
That he was less than three feet away
before he threw it.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.323
So it was intentional.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.617
Either that, or he was shot
before he could throw it.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.244
How'd you I.D. him?

08:55.369 --> 08:58.956
Prints on the left hand were intact.
Lower mandible, too. Did the trick.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.543
Do you mind if I get
a set of prints for myself?

09:03.085 --> 09:04.253
Knock yourself out.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.275
Aaron Shore.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.859
<i>It's Dan Pyne from</i> Politico.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.361
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.822
<i>We're going with a story
about Speaker Hookstraten.</i>

09:31.947 --> 09:33.949
<i>Wanted to give you guys
a chance to comment.</i>

09:34.783 --> 09:36.410
Okay, well, what's the story?

09:37.828 --> 09:38.996
Excuse me.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.582
Excuse me.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.294
- Did you see what just hit <i>Politico?</i>
- No.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.846
- This is bad, right?
- No, this is really bad.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.234
- Hey.
- Hey. You heard?

10:09.359 --> 10:10.861
Yeah, Aaron gave me a heads-up.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.198
- Mr. President.
- Thank you, Ava.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.200
Am I missing something here?

10:17.326 --> 10:20.329
Because as far as I can tell,
Kimble took a trip to Turkey

10:20.454 --> 10:23.915
during her first year in Congress,
six months later, co-signed a bill

10:24.041 --> 10:26.209
providing them
with further military assistance.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.754
Turkey's been a member
of NATO since 1952,

10:28.879 --> 10:31.423
so this is pretty standard practice.
What's the big deal?

10:31.548 --> 10:34.593
It's the optics, sir. It appears
as though she's accepting gifts

10:34.718 --> 10:37.346
- in return for military favors.
- I don't care about the optics.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.931
- There's no sign of malfeasance here.
- No, sir, but it's implied.

10:40.057 --> 10:42.184
And this is a town
that loves to connect the dots.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.896
She stayed in hotel suites in Ankara
and Istanbul and had lavish meals.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.106
What was she supposed to do,
check herself into a cell

10:48.231 --> 10:49.566
and survive on bread and water?

10:49.691 --> 10:53.528
The military-aid package included the
latest in digital-surveillance technology.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.615
At the time, the Pentagon was strongly
advising against giving it to Turkey.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.950
It was a controversial measure.
It only passed by four votes.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.786
Everyone on that trip voted
in favor of it.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.747
Circumstantial at best.
When can I talk to her?

11:03.872 --> 11:05.749
- I'll set it up.
- Okay. Thank you both.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.883
- Mike, what is it?
- It's about Nestor Lozano.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.761
Sir, there's a possibility
that he's alive.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.723
What? How is that even possible?

11:21.848 --> 11:23.975
Agent Wells thinks she spotted him
in North Dakota.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.311
If she's right, who did the FBI kill?

11:26.436 --> 11:28.730
Wells and Foerstel,
they're investigating that now.

11:29.940 --> 11:31.775
As a precaution, we're gonna
switch up your schedule

11:31.900 --> 11:33.443
and run more decoy motorcades.

11:33.902 --> 11:36.113
I'm not worried about me.
What about Alex and the kids?

11:36.238 --> 11:39.574
We're doing the same at Camp David,
along with increased perimeter security.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.453
- Sir, they won't even notice.
- Okay. Thank you, Mike.

11:43.578 --> 11:44.705
Thank you, sir.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.167
No, that's good.
That sounds like a win-win for everybody.

11:49.292 --> 11:50.293
Senator Bowman.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.129
Let me know
when you have Goodman on board.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.089
We'll see what we can do
about pushing it out of committee.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.008
If this has something to do with
your new boss, I have nothing to say.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.176
She didn't do anything wrong.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.845
Then there's nothing for her
to worry about.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.805
Except you can't un-ring a bell, Senator.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.850
Now, we both know an accusation
is just as bad as a conviction.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.685
I'm sorry. I'm having a really hard time
understanding

12:06.810 --> 12:09.855
- what any of this has to do with me.
- What, you're saying it's a coincidence

12:09.980 --> 12:13.275
that right when she beats you on the
gun-control bill that this hits <i>Politico?</i>

12:13.400 --> 12:16.570
You're not White House Chief of Staff
anymore, Shore. I'd watch your mouth.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.157
Nobody from my office gave that story
to <i>Politico.</i>

12:21.324 --> 12:24.745
- And you expect me to believe that?
- I don't give a damn what you believe.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.668
It's a match.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.379
Yeah, but the body in the morgue
isn't Lozano's.

12:34.504 --> 12:36.673
There's enough left of his face
to tell that.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.134
But there's a positive I.D.
Who screwed up?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.678
No one did. Fingerprints
and dental records matched.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.389
Someone hacked the IAFIS database.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.933
They switched Lozano's records
with the dead man's.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.145
You realize what you're saying?

12:52.522 --> 12:54.566
The clearance level
it would take to pull that off.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.234
- Yes.
- Well, we've known for a while

12:56.359 --> 12:58.862
that someone in the White House
made Kirkman designated survivor.

12:59.529 --> 13:02.532
Yeah, we thought it was someone
who probably died in the Capitol bombing.

13:02.657 --> 13:06.328
I think it's time that we consider
that this person may still be active.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.668
You know how it works
at the Bureau.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.670
I can't say anything
about the death of Majid Nassar.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.214
It's an open investigation.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.258
All right, but you know
Deputy Director Atwood, right?

13:20.383 --> 13:22.052
I haven't seen him in a while.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.345
Well, what does that mean?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.931
- Means I haven't seen him in a while.
- What, he's not there anymore?

13:26.056 --> 13:27.516
- I didn't say that.
- Well, you implied it.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.185
- No, I didn't.
- What, was he canned? Is that it?

13:31.686 --> 13:34.439
You're a disgrace, you know that?
You're worse than Atwood.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.608
Whoa, whoa. Wait. What a minute.
What does that mean?

13:36.733 --> 13:39.569
- Don't call me anymore.
- What does that mean?

13:45.200 --> 13:46.535
Just a couple more.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.621
Okay, great.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.706
Gentlemen, I want to thank you
for your service.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.875
And I promise,
we will look at the numbers

13:54.000 --> 13:55.919
for those body cameras
as soon as possible.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.588
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you. Gentlemen.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.219
Sir, Speaker Hookstraten.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.763
- Great. Madam Speaker.
- Mr. President.

14:06.888 --> 14:09.307
Well, this afternoon took a turn,
didn't it?

14:09.432 --> 14:10.600
- Yes, sir.
- Please.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.812
Thank you. I just wanted to assure you
that the trip I took

14:13.937 --> 14:16.648
and the bill I co-sponsored
were completely unrelated.

14:16.773 --> 14:17.983
Kimble, I believe you.

14:18.108 --> 14:22.571
The trip was largely agricultural:
drip irrigation, things like that.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.656
I thought it would be useful
for my constituents.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.116
And the bill?

14:26.241 --> 14:29.494
I co-sponsored it
with Representative Holden of Ohio,

14:29.619 --> 14:31.496
former Chair of the Armed Services
Committee.

14:31.621 --> 14:35.166
- I've heard he was a good man.
- He was my mentor.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.169
And he believed the aid package
was necessary

14:38.295 --> 14:41.590
to protect American personnel
at Incirlik Air Base.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.009
And a majority of Congress
agreed with him, as it turned out.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.344
Well, just tell people
what you just told me.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.721
You have a ton of supporters.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.141
It's a whole new ballgame out there, sir.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.603
The new Senate is like
the old Senate: conventional.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.522
They were all appointed
to replace their predecessors.

14:57.647 --> 15:02.193
But the House... they were all elected,
and they're young.

15:02.319 --> 15:05.530
- Youngest House in U.S. history.
- And I'm old guard, sir.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.784
They don't see me
as their legitimate Speaker.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.203
I got here the same way you did...
by surviving.

15:12.329 --> 15:15.123
Well, that's not fair or true.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.958
You were elected.
You were a serving Congresswoman.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.836
Besides, if they wanted to replace you,
they could have done it a while ago.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.005
They were finding their feet.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.549
And now they have their excuse
to replace me.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.009
Because of Senator Bowman.

15:26.134 --> 15:29.054
He's denying it,
but who benefits most from this?

15:29.179 --> 15:32.349
- I'm his biggest rival in the party.
- Son of a bitch.

15:32.474 --> 15:35.310
I'm sorry to interrupt.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.854
- What is it?
- I thought you would both want to hear...

15:37.979 --> 15:40.023
the House Ethics Committee
just announced

15:40.148 --> 15:42.359
that they are opening
an investigation into the Speaker.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.080
Jay Whitaker, Homeland Security Adviser.

15:55.205 --> 15:58.333
- Thank you for meeting me.
- I put together that video you asked for.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.711
We were able to reconstruct Lozano's path
from the PLC Building

16:01.836 --> 16:04.381
where the assassination attempt
took place

16:04.506 --> 16:07.717
to the Annapolis facility
where he was taken down.

16:09.052 --> 16:12.055
This is Lozano exiting the PLC Building.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.391
This is the camera that covers
the main entrance.

16:14.516 --> 16:18.228
This camera covers the side,
and you see him walking there.

16:18.353 --> 16:21.564
He walks two blocks
north to Union Station.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.025
Then we got him on camera
passing an ATM machine.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.113
Next we pick him up in the parking garage
where he jacked the minivan.

16:28.238 --> 16:29.739
We have the minivan
on constant camera surveillance

16:29.864 --> 16:32.367
all the way out of the city.
It's all on the flash drive.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.410
Good.

16:33.535 --> 16:37.414
Here's where Maryland State Police
spot him entering Annapolis.

16:37.539 --> 16:41.042
A unit attempts to pull him over,
which leads to a high-speed pursuit.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.420
But Lozano manages to elude them.

16:44.004 --> 16:47.757
Then he flees on foot
into the marine-storage facility.

16:48.383 --> 16:50.593
At this point, Maryland State Police

16:50.719 --> 16:53.555
set up a perimeter
and wait for the FBI to show up.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.098
This is how that plays out.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.605
And that flash,
is that the grenade going off?

17:02.731 --> 17:06.108
Yes. At first we thought he was shot
before he could throw it,

17:06.233 --> 17:08.737
but the coroner's report
was inconclusive.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.655
He may have detonated it deliberately.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.782
From what I've read,
Lozano was a total soldier.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.996
Well, this is very impressive. Thank you.

17:18.121 --> 17:20.749
It's all on here,
including the highway cams, as I said.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.167
This is gonna help us a lot
with the rest of our investigation.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.252
I'm just glad
we caught the son of a bitch.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.214
Yeah.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.091
Me too.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.640
Hey, Dan.

17:38.892 --> 17:39.934
Shore.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.645
- Nice smear job.
- Give me a break.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.355
I called you for a comment.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.400
Yeah, and you buried it
under four graphs of innuendo.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.196
Look, I want to see
both sides of the story.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.490
And the Speaker's willing
to sit with you, an exclusive.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.703
I already reported
that she denies any wrongdoing.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.873
Yeah, but... but it's not the same
as letting her tell her side to the story.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.500
Well, she can tell the Ethics Committee.

18:03.625 --> 18:06.503
Hey, you could at least give her
the same platform you gave to Bowman.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.882
Look, I didn't give Bowman anything.

18:11.007 --> 18:15.261
And for your information, there's
lots of people gunning for your boss.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.476
<i>In the latest scandal
to hit Washington,</i>

18:21.601 --> 18:24.229
<i>the House Ethics Committee
has opened an investigation</i>

18:24.354 --> 18:27.899
<i>into Speaker of the House Hookstraten
for alleged improprieties</i>

18:28.024 --> 18:31.402
<i>involving a military-aid package
to Turkey 12 years ago.</i>

18:31.528 --> 18:33.363
Thank God we didn't go public
with your choice.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.490
Maybe we should.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.910
No. Sir, this is not the time
to double down.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.411
We need to cut her loose now.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.373
Kimble told me she didn't do
anything wrong, and I believe her.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.416
If you nominate her at this point,

18:45.542 --> 18:47.210
you will destroy
all of the political capital

18:47.335 --> 18:50.380
- we've worked so hard to gain.
- I don't believe that's necessarily true.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.382
We can take our case
to the American people.

18:52.507 --> 18:55.718
But, sir, your battle isn't with the
American people, it's with Congress.

18:55.844 --> 18:57.762
- And you'll lose.
- I'm sorry.

18:57.887 --> 19:00.306
She's the right choice,
and I'm not gonna back down.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.935
Okay. I'll stay in contact with Aaron,

19:04.060 --> 19:06.020
get a sense of where things stand
with the Committee.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.857
I also want Seth to start working
on a press release.

19:08.982 --> 19:11.693
I want to remind the American people
of what we've just accomplished here,

19:11.818 --> 19:13.611
and let them know
that Speaker Hookstraten

19:13.736 --> 19:15.697
is our bridge
across that bipartisan divide.

19:16.531 --> 19:19.075
What about finding a surrogate
to author an op-ed?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.620
That's a good idea.

19:22.745 --> 19:25.123
- Let's see what names we can attach to it.
- We'll do everything we can.

19:25.248 --> 19:26.082
Thank you.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.215
The reservation's in your name.
The ambassador's a fan of Riesling,

19:34.340 --> 19:36.759
so I had them put aside
a bottle of '14 Emmerich Knoll.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.261
All right. What about that tweet?

19:39.596 --> 19:41.139
"If these allegations prove true,

19:41.264 --> 19:43.892
it will be a damn shame
for Speaker Hookstraten and the country."

19:44.601 --> 19:46.352
Good. Send it.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.819
Just make sure not to comment
on the investigation, per se.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.655
- Did you see Bowman's latest tweet?
- Oh, yeah, pretty transparent.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.240
Now, the release...
we need to talk about--

19:59.365 --> 20:01.409
Yeah, I got it. Uh, just
a general statement of support

20:01.534 --> 20:04.245
for a woman with a long record
of outstanding service to the country.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.831
- Couldn't have said it better myself.
- Yeah, that's why I'm the press secretary.

20:06.956 --> 20:08.666
I'll push it out
to the briefing-room list.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.460
Okay, just make sure
it's the first thing they read.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.670
- And the op-ed?
- Yeah, uh, let me write it first,

20:12.795 --> 20:14.547
then we can see
who we can drum up to sign it.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.967
Swing big, okay?
He really wants this to happen.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.135
Yep.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.398
Jason Atwood, right?

20:33.650 --> 20:36.152
Abe Leonard, <i>New York Standard.</i>
You got a minute?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.613
Nope.

20:39.113 --> 20:40.406
What happened?

20:40.823 --> 20:42.992
Don't tell me it was
from a shaving accident.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.205
Hey, I'm not looking for trouble.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.041
I just got a few questions
about Majid Nassar.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.794
- Excuse me. Can I have the check, please?
- Right away, sir.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.964
You were Acting Deputy Director
of the FBI,

20:56.089 --> 20:58.132
lead investigator
on the Capitol bombing, right?

21:01.261 --> 21:05.014
Come on. That's public record. I'm just
trying to find out what happened next.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.558
Why'd they fire you?

21:07.684 --> 21:08.851
I resigned.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.853
Well, a White House source
tells me different.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.942
This have anything to do with your son?

21:18.361 --> 21:21.322
Don't you ever talk about my son.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.867
Okay, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm just trying...

21:31.958 --> 21:33.334
First you're leading
the bombing investigation,

21:33.459 --> 21:36.004
then you see Nassar die
the day he's in custody,

21:36.129 --> 21:38.047
then your son gets kidnapped.

21:39.716 --> 21:40.883
Ow.

21:41.009 --> 21:43.678
I told you: don't mention my son.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.471
Ah, my bad.

21:46.681 --> 21:49.142
I just want to know
what happened to Majid Nassar.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.103
Are you a good guy or a bad guy?

22:03.072 --> 22:04.907
Got it. Thanks, John.

22:08.661 --> 22:11.873
House Ethics Committee.
They want to see me tomorrow.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.959
- That was fast.
- They're like a firing squad.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.878
- Yep.
- How did it go?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.838
Well, it didn't come from Bowman.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.550
In that case, I might have a good idea
where it did come from.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.595
- Who?
- I want to check it out first.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.600
It's funny. Yesterday, I was talking
about the vice presidency,

22:30.725 --> 22:34.270
and today,
I'm fighting for my political life.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.985
How the hell did he know I was
at the prison when Nassar got killed?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.487
There has to be a leak, Hannah.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.614
Leonard said he has a source
at the White House.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.492
Oh, we're looking into it, believe me.
We just have to be really careful.

22:47.617 --> 22:51.746
So, what am I supposed to do?
Stay at home while all this goes down?

22:51.871 --> 22:52.997
Look, I need to help.

22:53.122 --> 22:54.624
- You can't.
- What do you mean I can't?

22:54.749 --> 22:58.836
You... You can't. You can't shoot a gun.
You can't even drive a car.

22:58.961 --> 23:00.922
I need you to heal right now, Jason.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.757
Go and find somewhere
to stay, off the grid.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.009
Like, go hide somewhere?
Look, I don't hide.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.428
I cannot be worrying about you
when all of this is going on.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.430
- You don't have to worry about me.
- But I do!

23:09.555 --> 23:12.850
- You need backup.
- I'm gonna go it alone for now.

23:12.975 --> 23:15.311
- What?
- It's better than widening our circle.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.565
Look, Jason...

23:20.983 --> 23:23.111
I know it's hard for you
to take a back seat.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.449
You got to trust me.
It's gonna be okay.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.413
You remember your first time
going through a door?

23:34.664 --> 23:38.126
- You think I forgot East Baltimore?
- And you almost threw up in the hallway.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.837
I think I did... a little.

23:42.338 --> 23:44.757
You saw me and you told me to calm down.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.510
You said everything was gonna be okay.

23:49.595 --> 23:50.972
I'm gonna trust you.

24:02.984 --> 24:05.695
Hey. I love the op-ed piece.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.864
Oh, thanks.
You want to put your name on it?

24:09.198 --> 24:10.241
Problems?

24:10.366 --> 24:12.577
I sent it to six people.
They all said "no."

24:12.702 --> 24:14.537
Really? I thought that being able
to take credit

24:14.662 --> 24:16.747
for a piece of your writing
would be incentive enough.

24:16.873 --> 24:17.915
I'm serious.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.417
It's not the quality of the piece.

24:19.542 --> 24:22.086
It's that nobody wants to stick
their necks out for a dead duck.

24:22.211 --> 24:23.588
It's that bad, huh?

24:23.713 --> 24:26.215
Look, not to mix metaphors,
but there's blood in the water, Emily.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.177
- The people I've sent this to know that.
- Okay. Well, keep trying.

24:29.302 --> 24:31.888
- Yeah. Big swings, right?
- Exactly.

24:35.475 --> 24:38.769
- Liam Price to see you.
- Thank you, Kristie. Send him in.

24:38.895 --> 24:39.854
Come on in, Mr. Price.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.315
Speaker Hookstraten.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.111
Liam. How long has it been?

24:47.236 --> 24:50.615
- So, you figured it out.
- It wasn't that hard.

24:50.740 --> 24:53.451
I thought,
"Who worked for me 12 years ago

24:53.576 --> 24:55.953
that'd want to stab me
in the back today?"

24:56.078 --> 24:57.788
You fired me.

24:57.914 --> 25:00.124
You were taking money from lobbyists.

25:00.249 --> 25:04.253
And if I recall, I didn't fire you,
I gave you the chance to resign.

25:04.378 --> 25:08.090
Well, now <i>you</i> will have that same option.

25:08.216 --> 25:09.258
Oh.

25:10.218 --> 25:12.929
So, let me guess...
you've been to Bowman's office.

25:14.889 --> 25:16.432
He'll never make it to the White House.

25:17.099 --> 25:18.267
We'll see.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.772
I should've gone public with you
12 years ago, Liam,

25:22.897 --> 25:24.398
fed you to the wolves.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.776
Too late now.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.446
Not really.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.117
I still have the evidence
against you, Liam.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.702
And now...

25:37.119 --> 25:39.121
Senator Bowman does, too.

25:41.707 --> 25:44.293
You know, I doubt any presidential hopeful

25:44.418 --> 25:48.631
would want anything to do
with a lying, unscrupulous punk like you.

25:55.638 --> 25:57.098
You can go now, Liam.

26:06.148 --> 26:09.360
It is very convincing
when you first look at it.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.613
Here is Lozano, supposedly
leaving the PLC Building

26:12.738 --> 26:15.449
after the assassination attempt,
but look... his face is always down,

26:15.575 --> 26:17.159
away from
the surveillance cameras, right?

26:17.285 --> 26:19.370
His back is turned. His collar's up.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.163
Now, look at the street.

26:21.289 --> 26:22.707
- Same deal.
- Mm.

26:22.832 --> 26:26.252
Could be Lozano, but who knows?
Now, the parking garage.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.463
We're on his back the whole time.

26:30.464 --> 26:33.843
- It's like he knows where the cameras are.
- Exactly.

26:33.968 --> 26:36.095
And the next time
we get a good look at him...

26:39.265 --> 26:41.475
...he's crossing from the car
to the storage facility.

26:41.601 --> 26:43.978
- Right. There's no way to tell.
- Right.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.106
So, when did they make the switch?

26:50.192 --> 26:54.196
Here is the footage
from the PLC Building after the shooting.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.828
And now this is the next morning,

27:00.953 --> 27:03.914
20 hours and 17 minutes after that.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.666
Long after the building has been cleared,

27:05.791 --> 27:07.627
long after the suspect
has been shot dead...

27:11.631 --> 27:14.383
...someone leaves the building.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.804
- Would you like me to zoom in?
- Please.

27:24.894 --> 27:29.023
Lozano never left the building that day.
He waited till the coast was clear.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.150
He left the next day.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.029
So, it's true?

27:35.154 --> 27:36.572
Lozano is alive, sir.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.617
- And Agent Wells is absolutely positive?
- Yes, sir.

27:39.742 --> 27:41.786
The man the FBI killed was a decoy

27:41.911 --> 27:45.247
and was willing to sacrifice his life
to help Lozano escape.

27:45.915 --> 27:48.042
Sacrifice his life for what?

27:48.834 --> 27:50.086
And why?

27:53.339 --> 27:55.591
How many more of them are out there?

28:02.098 --> 28:03.432
Good news.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.103
We got a hit on the dead guy's prints.
Desmond Legarth.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.605
ATF picked him up in 2005
on a gun-possession charge.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.524
I just sent you the file.

28:13.943 --> 28:16.153
This guy fell off the grid six years ago.

28:16.278 --> 28:17.988
Before that, he was Army Infantry.

28:18.114 --> 28:21.075
His last known employment
was a small-arms instructor for--

28:21.200 --> 28:22.493
Browning Reed.

28:22.618 --> 28:25.496
Financial forensics did
a full work-up on him.

28:25.621 --> 28:29.083
He took out a loan
for his mother's house in 2003.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.793
You know who co-signed that loan?

28:32.461 --> 28:34.213
The C.E.O. of Browning Reed.

28:37.091 --> 28:38.467
- Patrick Lloyd?
- Yeah.

28:39.635 --> 28:41.095
I'll be back.

28:41.804 --> 28:43.139
Where you going?

28:45.141 --> 28:47.518
Where are we at with the op-ed?

28:47.643 --> 28:49.103
Whose names are attached?

28:50.062 --> 28:51.522
Reagan Whithorne, sir.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.607
Former one-term congressman
from Arkansas.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.819
- That's it? Who's rolling it out?
- The <i>Sentinel.</i>

28:56.944 --> 28:59.029
- Oh.
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.031
- It's the best we could do.
- It's not your fault.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.992
- It's a good piece of writing, Seth.
- Thank you.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.034
What's the word from Aaron?

29:04.160 --> 29:06.787
Speaker Hookstraten appears
before the Ethics Committee tomorrow.

29:07.663 --> 29:10.207
They're gonna go after her hard.
Looks like she was right

29:10.332 --> 29:12.626
about the younger generation
wanting to replace her.

29:12.752 --> 29:16.422
That's the information I have, also.
It may not be possible to save her.

29:19.842 --> 29:22.928
You know what? To hell with it.
Run the op-ed. Now.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.930
Yes, sir. Okay...

29:32.772 --> 29:34.106
I'm good. Thanks.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.067
Long time.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.528
- I've been busy.
- I've noticed.

29:40.821 --> 29:42.823
So, why are you looking
for Patrick Lloyd?

29:43.949 --> 29:45.367
It's a two-way street.

29:45.493 --> 29:48.954
You want intel from the Agency,
I get intel from the Bureau.

29:49.538 --> 29:50.706
Beck...

29:51.165 --> 29:53.250
I've never denied you anything
when you've asked for it.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.377
You don't need to know
why I'm looking for Lloyd.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.841
I met him a few times, scary dude.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.594
Spent 16 years in Special Forces,

30:03.719 --> 30:06.722
completed more classified missions
than anyone in his unit.

30:07.389 --> 30:10.601
In 2000, he inherited a fortune
from his father's business,

30:10.726 --> 30:13.646
put it all into Browning Reed.

30:14.814 --> 30:15.856
Okay.

30:16.857 --> 30:21.779
After 9/11, he won over $2 billion
in government contracts, super patriot.

30:21.904 --> 30:24.740
A friend to politicians and generals.

30:25.574 --> 30:28.619
- Until things went south.
- Yeah, I heard.

30:28.744 --> 30:31.288
Scandals and lawsuits.
Company went under.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.374
Yeah, but not because
he couldn't afford it,

30:33.499 --> 30:36.210
because he felt betrayed
by his own government.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.671
He turned.

30:39.547 --> 30:43.717
Since he dissolved the company,
Lloyd's become a political player.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.219
He started behind the scenes,

30:45.344 --> 30:48.639
but now he's making
more public appearances now.

30:48.764 --> 30:52.977
Very big on the alt-right circuit, but
he makes those guys look like liberals.

30:53.102 --> 30:58.065
Scary thing is, he's got the IQ
and the money to back up his views.

30:58.691 --> 30:59.775
So where do we find him?

31:01.443 --> 31:03.445
He's been hiding
in plain sight the whole time.

31:23.591 --> 31:25.467
Oh, we have visitors.

31:26.051 --> 31:28.262
Will you take that for me, please?
Thank you.

31:29.763 --> 31:31.682
Hey, there.

31:31.807 --> 31:34.268
FBI or, uh... Homeland?

31:34.393 --> 31:35.811
What gave us away?

31:35.936 --> 31:38.063
Oh, shoes, the walk...

31:38.397 --> 31:40.691
The fact that federal agents
raided a piece of property

31:40.816 --> 31:43.777
that was owned by my former company
a few nights ago, take your pick.

31:44.820 --> 31:46.488
- FBI.
- Ah.

31:47.072 --> 31:48.991
I'm Agent Foerstel.
This is Agent Wells.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.869
So, how about we talk about that silo?

31:51.994 --> 31:54.538
- And the munitions you were keeping there.
- Certainly.

31:54.663 --> 31:57.875
They are Russian-made land mines,
300,000 of them,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.878
flooded the market
after Russia pulled out of Afghanistan.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.880
Browning Reed bought them, legally,

32:03.005 --> 32:06.091
and used them for our de-mining training.

32:06.842 --> 32:10.304
My attorney has
all the import permits on file.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.473
- Here's his card.
- Hmm.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.558
Though, I expect he'll contact you first,

32:14.683 --> 32:17.728
once he's pulled together the charges
for the illegal search and seizure.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.271
What about Desmond Legarth?

32:20.105 --> 32:21.065
Who's that?

32:21.190 --> 32:23.525
You bought his mother a house.
You don't remember his name?

32:23.651 --> 32:27.154
Well, if I did that, then I assume
he must have worked for me.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.573
I gave loans to hundreds
of my employees over the years,

32:29.698 --> 32:32.910
most of them veterans,
ignored by the country they served.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.287
See, I won't ignore them,

32:35.871 --> 32:39.041
and I won't fail our ancestors
by allowing America

32:39.166 --> 32:41.877
to become a broken
system of oppression. It...

32:44.630 --> 32:46.340
What did Mr. Legarth do?

32:47.341 --> 32:49.927
He's a person of interest
in an ongoing investigation.

32:50.052 --> 32:52.972
Well, you must be searching in the dark
if you're talking to me.

32:54.139 --> 32:56.767
Well, we're not reading
tea leaves, Mr. Lloyd.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.018
Fact is,

32:58.143 --> 33:00.437
Browning Reed keeps coming up
in connection to our case.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.023
Browning Reed no longer exists.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.859
Uh, yet they still hold titles
to properties and munitions.

33:05.985 --> 33:10.739
Liquidating a billion-dollar business
takes time, Agent Foerstel.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.866
It's something that someone
on a government salary

33:12.992 --> 33:15.077
might have trouble understanding.

33:15.202 --> 33:18.747
If you want to talk again,
please feel free to contact my attorney.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.589
Charming.

33:58.787 --> 33:59.788
What?

34:06.879 --> 34:08.422
"We have failed our ancestors

34:08.547 --> 34:11.967
by allowing America to become
a broken system of oppression.

34:12.092 --> 34:15.012
It is our job to take back
America from the corrupt leaders

34:15.137 --> 34:17.139
who seek to take our land and money."

34:19.141 --> 34:21.643
Everything he's saying; it's all there.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.831
Go home. It's late.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.833
Hey, did you put eyes on Lloyd?

34:46.251 --> 34:48.128
Yes, 24/7.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.380
And I'm betting
he's very well aware of it.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.717
It's fine. Maybe it'll slow him down.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.553
Look...

34:56.678 --> 34:57.679
If you're right,

34:58.472 --> 35:02.017
if he's the guy behind this,
it's gonna be just like MacLeish.

35:02.142 --> 35:05.479
Knowing and proving
are two very different things.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.648
And Lloyd is 10 times more dangerous.

35:07.773 --> 35:13.195
He is protected in every way;
physically, financially, legally.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.572
- No one is above the law.
- Yes, I get that,

35:15.697 --> 35:18.033
but it's gonna be very difficult
to catch him with dirty hands.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.870
We're gonna have to work our way
through his whole organization.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.497
His organization?

35:24.540 --> 35:25.707
What organization?

35:26.458 --> 35:29.795
I was down there in North Dakota.
I saw them. They vanished.

35:30.879 --> 35:33.048
They're everywhere and nowhere.

35:33.173 --> 35:36.009
They're the waitress
at the restaurant down the road.

35:36.135 --> 35:37.511
They're your accountant.

35:38.303 --> 35:39.721
We're...

35:40.389 --> 35:42.099
We're not gonna flush them out.

35:42.224 --> 35:45.269
Okay, look, we'll hit this again
in the morning, okay?

35:45.394 --> 35:47.312
You need to get some rest.
Go home.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.189
Yeah, I'm just...

35:49.314 --> 35:51.733
I'm in no rush to get back
to the fleabag motel.

35:52.901 --> 35:54.403
Get some rest.

35:55.737 --> 35:56.989
I will.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.074
Okay.

36:16.925 --> 36:19.761
- Hey, Jason. It's me.
<i>- Hey. What's going on?</i>

36:20.262 --> 36:24.057
Look, I know I told you to lay low,
but... I need your help.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.560
<i>Name it. What do you need?</i>

36:27.561 --> 36:29.188
Patrick Lloyd.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.491
Hello?

36:41.617 --> 36:43.994
Little pea, how are you?

36:44.119 --> 36:47.956
Hey, Daddy. I miss you.

36:48.081 --> 36:50.542
I miss you
more than anything in the world.

36:51.376 --> 36:52.461
Me too.

36:52.586 --> 36:54.254
Where is Mommy?

36:54.379 --> 36:57.132
Upstairs, helping Leo
with his homework.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.302
- Want me to go get her?
<i>- No.</i>

37:00.427 --> 37:01.970
No, I want to talk to you.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.848
Okay.

37:06.642 --> 37:08.644
Did you have fun
with your tutor today?

37:08.769 --> 37:11.355
Yeah. She lets me watch the news.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.025
- I saw you on the TV.
- You did?

37:15.150 --> 37:18.153
They said you might pick
that lady as your vice president.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.614
<i>The one you gave the pen to.</i>

37:21.156 --> 37:23.825
Did you know
she'd be the first girl vice president?

37:23.951 --> 37:25.619
Yeah, I did.

37:26.411 --> 37:27.871
You think that's cool?

37:27.996 --> 37:29.414
Yeah.

37:31.667 --> 37:32.918
Me too.

39:41.922 --> 39:43.131
Over here.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.472
That's far enough.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.142
What did you learn?

39:54.768 --> 39:56.561
Well, Atwood was fired.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.356
Some agents are calling him a disgrace.

39:59.481 --> 40:01.691
- And what does that tell you?
- I don't know.

40:01.817 --> 40:04.444
But it's got something
to do with Majid Nassar.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.531
Check the White House log
for the day after Nassar was killed.

40:07.656 --> 40:09.449
- The White House log?
- I'm leaving now.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.577
- Don't follow me.
- Well...

40:48.321 --> 40:50.240
- Yeah?
<i>- How'd it go?</i>

40:50.365 --> 40:51.491
Clockwork.

40:52.367 --> 40:54.453
Good. We're back on track.
