00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
September 18th, 1944-

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
After three days of fighting,

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
The airfield on Peleliu was captured.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
The immediate reports back

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Were that it would be over in a day or two.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
That was not the case at all.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
The worst was waiting for us.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
As casualties mounted,

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
It became clear that U.S.
Intelligence

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Had failed to anticipate the
level of Japanese resistance.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Looming behind the airfield

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Were high coral ridges
that spanned the island.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
The Japanese had created an elaborate system

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Of underground fortresses.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Intelligence didn't have a clue

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
What we were going into.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
If the intelligence had been
what it should have been,

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
I don't think we'd have
ever hit that island.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Their whole cave system on Peleliu

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Was unbelievable.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
We had never seen anything
like that before in the war.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
There was over 500 caves.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
It was one Ce right after another.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
You had to dig them out one at a time.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
We were fighting a ruthless enemy

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
And he'll die before
he'll be taken prisoner.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
So you've got to make sure
he dies instead of you.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
And it was a fight to the finish

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
For 30 straight days-

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Day and night.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
We lost a lot of men.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
An unsettling amount killed

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
And a tremendous amount wounded.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
It's something you never forget.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
You handle it well.
- Handle what well?

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Membership in the famous people's club.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Just don't be surprised if it's
not quite what you expect.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
The entire division's moving
across the airfield.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
The only way to stop this Jap artillery
is to get into those hills.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
And the only way into those
hills is across this airfield.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
We have to cross that?

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Move out.
- Go go go.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Keep moving.
Let's go.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Oswalt.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
We need cover fire.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Sir, coming across the airfield today...

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
I've never been more
scared in my entire life.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
History is full of wars

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Fought for 100 reasons.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
But this war,
I have to believe

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
That every step across that airfield,

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Every man I lose,
that it's all worth while

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Because our cause is just.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
Moving into the hills.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
We can't take this objective
without unacceptable casualties.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
sounds like some guy having a nightmare.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
God damn it, shut up.

00:08.200 --> 00:08.200
I guess better him than all of us.

00:08.200 --> 03:25.405
Sledgehammer's right.
It had to be done.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.405
Hanging, fire.

03:32.442 --> 03:34.442
Sledge, drop...

05:43.781 --> 05:45.781
Thanks.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.484
Burgin.
- Hillbilly.

05:56.620 --> 06:00.158
You used to not smoke.

06:00.192 --> 06:01.794
Guess I do now.

06:01.894 --> 06:05.395
I need volunteers.
N.C.O. S report to me

06:05.430 --> 06:07.164
At 1050.

06:07.264 --> 06:09.644
Corpsman, do blister checks.

06:09.666 --> 06:12.134
Draw ammo and be resupplied

06:12.168 --> 06:14.903
And ready to move at 1100.

06:14.937 --> 06:17.405
Room service awaits

06:17.439 --> 06:19.775
And there's time to savor every bite.

06:19.875 --> 06:21.343
Go and get your chow.

06:21.443 --> 06:25.145
1100? Ack-ack just gave us the morning off.

06:25.179 --> 06:27.781
Let's go get some breakfast.

06:34.889 --> 06:37.158
I can't even recognize this place.

06:37.258 --> 06:40.928
Judging from those planes, I think it's
the airfield we took a while back.

06:41.028 --> 06:42.797
Oh, yeah, now I remember.

06:42.897 --> 06:44.833
We were over there and
the Japs were over there.

06:44.933 --> 06:47.169
The Japs were where we're sittin'.
- Right.

06:47.269 --> 06:50.004
It's all coming back to me now.

06:53.473 --> 06:55.908
Why didn't I enlist in the Seabees?

06:56.008 --> 07:00.683
I could have come to Peleliu
in the seat of a bulldozer.

07:03.246 --> 07:05.648
Any of you guys got a Jap sword or flag?

07:05.748 --> 07:08.348
I'll pay good money for it.

07:08.382 --> 07:11.817
Or a Jap bayonet?

07:11.851 --> 07:14.487
Any kind of Jap weapon- I'll take it.

07:14.587 --> 07:17.255
Sure.
I keep them in my ass.

07:17.289 --> 07:19.024
Reach up, grab what you want.

07:19.124 --> 07:20.626
Seriously.

07:20.726 --> 07:23.094
I gotta get me a Jap sword.

07:23.128 --> 07:24.730
I can't go home from the war empty-handed.

07:24.830 --> 07:26.197
I can arrange for a purple heart.

07:26.297 --> 07:29.066
Ain't nobody going home.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.405
Any of you guys got a Jap sword?

07:35.505 --> 07:37.640
Fuck off.

07:37.675 --> 07:39.977
Boys.
- Hello, sir.

07:40.012 --> 07:41.314
Hey, Skipper.
- Hey, Skip.

07:41.414 --> 07:43.414
Skip.

07:46.151 --> 07:49.253
Never run when you can walk.

07:49.288 --> 07:51.224
Never walk when you can stand.

07:51.324 --> 07:53.789
Never stand when you can sit.

07:53.794 --> 07:55.863
Never sit when you can lay down.

07:55.963 --> 07:58.898
Never lay down when you can sleep.

07:58.933 --> 08:03.035
And never pass a supply of clean water.

08:03.070 --> 08:05.672
Amen.

08:17.751 --> 08:19.786
You get enough to eat?

08:19.820 --> 08:21.820
I did, sir.

08:28.064 --> 08:30.529
You're a Southern man, right?

08:31.535 --> 08:35.272
Yes, sir.
Mobile, Alabama.

08:36.742 --> 08:39.945
You realize our ancestors
probably shot at each other

08:40.045 --> 08:41.981
At Gettysburg or bull run?

08:42.081 --> 08:45.352
My great-grandfather
served with general Bragg.

08:45.452 --> 08:48.521
Yeah?
What's your old man do?

08:48.555 --> 08:51.824
He's a doctor,
internal medicine.

08:51.859 --> 08:53.961
Treated vets from the first world war.

08:54.061 --> 08:56.331
Might have patched up gunny Haney.

08:56.431 --> 09:00.602
My dad's a shop foreman at a
textile mill in Massachusetts.

09:00.702 --> 09:03.739
He weaved wool fabric for the military-

09:03.839 --> 09:06.074
All our marine greens,

09:06.108 --> 09:08.377
Our blankets.

09:11.614 --> 09:14.283
It's nice to think my father
might have had something to do

09:14.383 --> 09:16.951
With the blankets we sleep in.

09:20.689 --> 09:22.689
Fuck.

09:25.294 --> 09:27.030
I got a detail for you.

09:27.130 --> 09:28.298
Yes, sir.

09:28.398 --> 09:30.767
No no, as you were.
As you were.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.867
You got a watch?

09:32.868 --> 09:35.334
Yes, sir.

09:35.368 --> 09:37.735
You show 0950?

09:37.770 --> 09:39.070
I do, sir.

09:39.170 --> 09:42.435
Good. Wake me up in 20 minutes.

09:48.039 --> 09:50.171
Will do, sir.

10:11.189 --> 10:14.657
Look at that.
- Let's go.

10:14.692 --> 10:17.327
Let's go.
You heard the Skipper.

10:17.361 --> 10:19.361
Let's go.

10:23.433 --> 10:25.934
That's the way to kill Japs-

10:25.969 --> 10:28.870
Buzz in, fry 'em, buzz back.

10:35.376 --> 10:38.044
Hey, look, it's colonel puller.

10:38.078 --> 10:40.078
It's the 1st marines.

10:43.883 --> 10:46.850
Sir.
- You're up, boys.

10:46.885 --> 10:48.453
Colonel.

10:48.553 --> 10:50.554
Hello, sir.

10:50.588 --> 10:52.956
Go get 'em.

10:56.394 --> 10:58.394
Good job.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.664
Way to go, 1st.

11:01.698 --> 11:03.533
Here you go.
- Thanks, man.

11:03.633 --> 11:05.633
Semper fi.

11:16.078 --> 11:18.078
Hey.

11:21.216 --> 11:23.416
How you doin'?

11:23.450 --> 11:25.951
Let's go.

11:49.570 --> 11:52.072
What kind of man walks into a field of fire

11:52.172 --> 11:53.640
In defense of his country?

11:53.740 --> 11:56.043
What kind of man has already
served his country

11:56.143 --> 11:59.479
As a soldier in the Philippines
way before Pearl Harbor,

11:59.579 --> 12:02.282
Then volunteers to fight
the Japs as a Marine

12:02.382 --> 12:04.351
In the islands of the Pacific?

12:04.451 --> 12:08.921
What kind of man risked his life

12:08.956 --> 12:11.424
Throughout a night of combat

12:11.459 --> 12:16.030
Running barefoot much-needed
ammunition back and forth

12:16.065 --> 12:18.434
To his buddy on the frontlines,

12:18.534 --> 12:22.038
Manning his machine gun
throughout the fight,

12:22.138 --> 12:25.107
Suffering horrible wounds

12:25.141 --> 12:27.944
While killing countless savage Japs

12:28.044 --> 12:31.214
In the key battle that won us Guadalcanal?

12:31.314 --> 12:34.749
I will tell you,
brothers:

12:34.784 --> 12:37.686
A fighting man like no other,

12:37.720 --> 12:40.823
Winner of the congressional medal of honor,

12:40.923 --> 12:45.393
America's own Sgt. John Basilone.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.373
Little R and R, Johnny?

13:24.878 --> 13:27.446
How long's he been here for?

13:59.390 --> 14:01.891
A whole lot of buckets.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.567
John.

15:27.971 --> 15:29.971
Ooh.

15:31.241 --> 15:33.477
What was that?
What happened?

15:33.577 --> 15:36.880
What the fuck is going on out there?
- I don't know.

15:36.980 --> 15:38.815
Who the hell was that?

15:38.915 --> 15:42.217
Two Japs, I think.

15:42.252 --> 15:46.389
One ran down the road.
The other jumped in packer's foxhole.

15:46.489 --> 15:48.192
All right, stay in your foxholes.

15:48.292 --> 15:49.794
Stay in your holes.
- Stay alert.

15:49.894 --> 15:52.195
There might be more.

15:54.332 --> 15:57.335
How long you people been doing this.?

15:57.435 --> 16:00.305
You don't get out of
your fucking hole at night

16:00.405 --> 16:04.573
Because this is what happens.

16:04.608 --> 16:08.207
One of us gets tired.

16:08.242 --> 16:11.540
One of us gets lazy.

16:11.574 --> 16:14.608
One of us doesn't keep his edge on,

16:14.642 --> 16:19.276
And this- this is what happens.

16:31.483 --> 16:35.218
What kind of guy gets out of his
hole at night without sounding off?

16:35.318 --> 16:37.320
The kind with two Japs up his ass.

16:37.420 --> 16:38.821
Just one.

16:38.921 --> 16:41.957
Leyden knows what it's like
to have a Jap up his ass.

16:42.057 --> 16:43.625
Fuck off.
- Can it, bill.

16:43.725 --> 16:46.361
Wh- what kind of asshole shoots the guy?

16:46.461 --> 16:48.495
An asshole like you.

16:53.701 --> 16:57.072
Move out. Down line.
Go for cover.

16:57.108 --> 17:00.346
Move down line.
We're moving left.

17:00.380 --> 17:03.785
Burgin. Plant your unit behind that bunker.

17:03.885 --> 17:05.885
Move out.

17:06.122 --> 17:08.628
Move down the line.
Let's go, let's go.

17:08.728 --> 17:12.636
Ahh.
God damn it. Oh, God.

17:14.874 --> 17:19.464
Get the bunker cleared.
- We got it. It's been cleared.

17:51.980 --> 17:54.714
Burgie. Burgie.

17:54.749 --> 17:57.016
Japs in the Er.

17:57.050 --> 17:59.518
First platoon cleared it with grenades.

17:59.618 --> 18:02.678
They must have checked.
- No, listen.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.628
Wake up, sledge.

18:07.662 --> 18:09.763
Burgie...

18:09.797 --> 18:12.064
I'm sure.

18:12.099 --> 18:15.033
They're in there.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.416
Son of a bitch.

18:57.502 --> 19:00.052
Sledgehammer, check that side.

19:03.673 --> 19:05.840
Ahhh.

19:10.979 --> 19:12.714
Sledgehammer, Burgie, up here.

19:12.814 --> 19:16.382
Keep 'em bottled up till I come back.

19:32.060 --> 19:34.528
Leyden.

19:39.667 --> 19:41.667
Fire in the hole.

19:43.038 --> 19:45.272
to your right.

19:47.843 --> 19:50.778
Grenade.
Grenade.

19:55.851 --> 19:58.821
Oh, fuck. - Look at me, look at me.
Look at me.

19:58.921 --> 20:01.023
I can't fucking see.
- You're all rig.

20:01.123 --> 20:05.296
Target 100yds to your right.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.500
Look at me, look at me.
You're all right.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.538
You're all right.
- I can't fucking see.

20:09.638 --> 20:11.841
You're gonna be all right.
Get off the bunker, God damn it.

20:11.941 --> 20:12.975
Ahh.
- Come on.

20:13.075 --> 20:14.075
Bill, come on.

20:14.175 --> 20:16.177
You gotta help me.
We gotta move. Come on.

20:16.277 --> 20:19.913
No no.
- Hold on, bill.

20:37.434 --> 20:39.568
Look at me.
Look at me.

20:41.605 --> 20:43.605
Gene.

20:44.207 --> 20:45.776
Gene.

20:45.876 --> 20:48.143
Ahh.

20:48.178 --> 20:50.579
gene.

20:50.613 --> 20:52.613
Ahh.

21:05.387 --> 21:06.821
Gene?

21:08.355 --> 21:09.356
Gene?

21:10.656 --> 21:11.424
Gene.

21:14.259 --> 21:17.893
Gene?
Fry 'em, Womack.

21:22.897 --> 21:25.630
Gene.

21:30.769 --> 21:33.470
Let the bastards burn.

21:33.504 --> 21:37.073
Ahhh.

21:54.061 --> 21:57.497
Die, you Jap fuck.
Fuckin' die.

21:57.531 --> 21:59.531
Fuckin' die.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.680
You okay?

22:26.581 --> 22:28.681
Why don't they just surrender?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.781
Because they're Japs.

22:32.117 --> 22:35.857
We're gonna have to root 'em out one by one.

22:36.982 --> 22:38.982
Fucking rats.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.135
Look at the gold teeth on this one.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.765
What have you got there?

23:23.981 --> 23:26.285
Ahh. - Christ.
Put him out of his misery.

23:26.385 --> 23:28.385
Fuck off.

23:38.930 --> 23:41.198
Makes it easier.

24:10.327 --> 24:11.829
Bullshit.

24:11.929 --> 24:16.134
The McCulloch boosted my.

24:16.169 --> 24:18.672
It only adds four p. S.I., snaf.

24:18.772 --> 24:21.175
You get better torque.
You know that.

24:21.275 --> 24:23.911
Yeah, well, you run that thing
for a while and it'll get noisy.

24:24.011 --> 24:26.011
So?

24:26.947 --> 24:29.649
How you doin', boys?
- Skipper.

24:29.683 --> 24:31.785
Gunny made some coffee if anyone wants some.

24:31.885 --> 24:33.787
It's actually pretty good.

24:33.887 --> 24:37.290
Burgie here says
superchargers are worthless.

24:37.390 --> 24:38.858
What you think, Skipper?

24:38.958 --> 24:42.394
Out here,
I'd have to agree with him.

24:48.100 --> 24:49.669
Here, take this.

24:49.769 --> 24:51.936
I'll get some more.

24:51.971 --> 24:53.971
Go on, take it.

24:58.712 --> 25:01.116
Any word on Leyden, Skipper?

25:01.152 --> 25:02.854
They already cleaned him up.

25:02.954 --> 25:05.290
That New York Irish hide of his

25:05.390 --> 25:07.292
Is tougher than any little
bit of Jap shrapnel.

25:07.392 --> 25:09.392
He'll be back soon.

25:11.163 --> 25:13.032
We're moving into the hills come dawn.

25:13.132 --> 25:14.401
Aye aye, sir.

25:14.501 --> 25:16.470
Burgie, I'm gonna need some
of your mortar squad

25:16.570 --> 25:20.518
To volunteer as stretcher-bearers.

25:30.552 --> 25:33.054
You can't dwell on it.

25:34.456 --> 25:37.692
You can't dwell on any of it.

25:47.203 --> 25:49.604
Try and get some rest, boys.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.701
Gotta move.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.808
Move it up there.

26:19.048 --> 26:20.883
Russo, get up there and find hillbilly.

26:20.983 --> 26:22.985
Pull him back.
Go.

26:31.765 --> 26:33.801
Stretchers, go.

26:33.835 --> 26:35.835
Go.

26:45.717 --> 26:47.885
Direct run.

26:50.122 --> 26:52.357
Go go go.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
Ahh.

27:23.457 --> 27:26.759
Don't stop. Keep moving.

27:26.793 --> 27:28.793
Keep moving.

27:31.097 --> 27:32.265
Here.

27:32.365 --> 27:35.267
Pick him up.
Move.

27:40.606 --> 27:43.340
Sledge, snafu, up here.

27:43.374 --> 27:46.477
Sledge, get your stretcher up here now.

27:46.577 --> 27:47.778
Come on, go.

27:47.878 --> 27:52.347
I need more ammo.
Give me more ammo.

27:53.716 --> 27:55.716
Corpsman.

27:55.717 --> 27:57.784
Over here.

27:59.653 --> 28:01.521
Get that shirt opened up.

28:01.621 --> 28:04.554
Let's get him back.

28:06.991 --> 28:09.858
Boys.
- I got the sulfur.

28:11.760 --> 28:14.128
We're good to go.
Get him on the stretcher.

28:14.228 --> 28:17.118
We're gonna need to move him fast.

28:22.866 --> 28:26.668
God damn it.

28:26.702 --> 28:28.137
Get him.

28:28.237 --> 28:30.237
Clear.

28:42.147 --> 28:45.749
Oh, fuck.
Fall back.

28:45.783 --> 28:47.918
Get up here.
- Fall back.

28:47.952 --> 28:50.587
Let's go.
Let's go.

28:50.621 --> 28:53.123
Let's go.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.861
Let's go.

29:26.352 --> 29:28.352
Eddie?

29:30.787 --> 29:32.787
Eddie.

29:44.859 --> 29:47.325
Take him back.

30:06.502 --> 30:08.836
Let me help you.

30:08.871 --> 30:11.139
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

30:11.239 --> 30:13.239
Come on.

30:22.312 --> 30:26.381
Did you see Haney?

30:26.416 --> 30:28.850
I saw him.

30:31.087 --> 30:33.656
Haney is the old breed.

30:33.690 --> 30:36.070
If a guy like that breaks...

30:38.961 --> 30:41.395
And hillbilly's dead.

30:44.298 --> 30:46.966
You can't dwell on it, Jay.

30:48.401 --> 30:50.866
You can't dwell on any of it.

30:52.803 --> 30:55.538
We go into those hills again,
I'm gonna get hit.

30:55.638 --> 30:57.638
I know it.

31:01.141 --> 31:04.742
I don't care anymore...

31:07.278 --> 31:10.212
Just as long as it's quick.

31:17.318 --> 31:19.783
Get that fucker.
- Everywhere.

31:21.689 --> 31:26.059
Fucking Japs.
- Japs are everywhere.

31:28.728 --> 31:32.363
Yankee... ( speaks Japanese )

32:04.467 --> 32:07.436
Hey hey.

32:07.470 --> 32:11.808
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

32:14.745 --> 32:16.745
You're okay.

32:22.422 --> 32:24.422
You'll be okay.

32:41.508 --> 32:43.910
How you holdin' up?

32:53.218 --> 32:56.287
Oh, God.

33:04.586 --> 33:06.586
oh, shit.

33:08.015 --> 33:10.582
Somebody fucking shoot him.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.285
Get him.
Get the bastard.

33:12.385 --> 33:14.120
Shoot. Shoot.

33:14.220 --> 33:16.220
Shoot him.

33:18.557 --> 33:20.458
What the fuck is the matter with you?

33:20.558 --> 33:22.861
Why'd you take so long to shoot him?

33:22.961 --> 33:27.032
Damn, Jay, if it ain't coming out
your mouth, it's coming out your ass.

33:27.132 --> 33:30.370
Looks like you in a sack race, Jay.

33:32.841 --> 33:35.709
Aw, shit.

33:36.611 --> 33:38.612
I shit myself.

33:38.646 --> 33:39.948
No kidding.

33:40.048 --> 33:42.849
Fuck- I fuckin' shit myself.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.621
You guys are fucking nuts.

33:46.721 --> 33:49.191
Go back and get some new dungarees, Jay.

33:49.291 --> 33:51.358
It's all over my hands.

33:51.392 --> 33:53.594
You left a trail, boy.

33:53.628 --> 33:55.830
They gonna find us now.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.211
Who's up ahead?
- Their platoon is on point, sir.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.312
Right up there.

34:09.347 --> 34:10.915
All right, Kelmar,
what do we got?

34:11.015 --> 34:12.617
Men in the hill,
right up there,

34:12.717 --> 34:14.952
Covering from that ridge
all the way to the left.

34:15.052 --> 34:17.053
That's good.
Go slow.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.016
Mortar.
Hold it up here.

34:56.526 --> 34:58.625
Corpsman.

35:22.479 --> 35:24.613
Sniper got the Skipper.

35:24.647 --> 35:26.647
Captain Haldane?

35:26.648 --> 35:28.915
Ack-ack's dead.

35:54.798 --> 35:57.465
Skipper's dead.

37:07.779 --> 37:11.210
All right, let's get your shit together.

37:11.244 --> 37:13.245
Squad leaders, let's go.
Let's get it movin'.

37:13.345 --> 37:17.085
We're going up.
- Get your gear. We're goin'.

37:56.702 --> 37:59.571
Let's go. Move up.

38:40.775 --> 38:42.477
Mortars, hold it here.

38:42.577 --> 38:45.480
Smarts with me, God damn it.
See what's up top.

38:45.580 --> 38:48.048
Let's go.

40:39.931 --> 40:43.967
What you doin', sledgehammer?

40:44.002 --> 40:46.272
I thought I'd bag me some Jap gold.

40:46.372 --> 40:47.941
You don't want to do that.

40:48.041 --> 40:50.342
Why not?

40:50.376 --> 40:52.611
I saw you do it.

40:57.489 --> 40:59.360
Don't.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.929
You shouldn't do it.

41:05.669 --> 41:07.540
The germs.

41:07.640 --> 41:11.813
Doc Caswell says all these
dead nips have germs.

41:14.183 --> 41:16.718
Germs.
- Bad germs.

41:16.752 --> 41:19.824
Diseases that'll make you sick.

41:25.935 --> 41:27.935
Bad germs.

41:35.313 --> 41:40.498
Well, is it all right with you
if I cut out his insignia then?

41:41.254 --> 41:43.023
No danger in that I know of.

41:43.123 --> 41:44.659
Yeah?

41:44.759 --> 41:47.495
That pass muster with you?

42:48.315 --> 42:50.649
Here, man.

43:39.263 --> 43:41.598
Keep it.

43:49.141 --> 43:51.141
Thanks.

44:32.250 --> 44:35.451
Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.

44:35.486 --> 44:37.287
Welcome back.

44:37.387 --> 44:38.589
You're a sight for sore eyes.

44:38.689 --> 44:40.124
Welcome back.
- Very kind of you.

44:40.224 --> 44:42.626
Here you go.
- What the hell are they doing here?

44:42.726 --> 44:45.094
Hi.

44:46.396 --> 44:48.031
Hi.
- Hi.

44:48.131 --> 44:50.132
Thank you, ma'am.

44:50.166 --> 44:52.101
Thank you very much.
- Here you are.

44:52.201 --> 44:54.201
Thanks, ma'am.

44:55.671 --> 44:57.671
Hi, welcome back.

44:57.673 --> 44:59.673
It's good to see you.

45:02.743 --> 45:06.545
Thank you.
- Okay, marine.

45:06.579 --> 45:09.979
You've had your look-see.
Now move along.
