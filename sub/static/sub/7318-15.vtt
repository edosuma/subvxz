WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:01.800
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.833 --> 00:02.767
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO US
WHEN SHE GOES ON LEAVE?

00:02.800 --> 00:04.200
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA GET
A NEW RESIDENT?

00:04.233 --> 00:05.633
MY MOTHER IS VERY SICK.

00:05.667 --> 00:07.733
I'M THE ONLY PERSON
SHE'LL ALLOW TO SEE HER.

00:07.767 --> 00:09.533
CUJO HAS TO GO!

00:09.567 --> 00:11.467
(Derek) HEY, DOC.
HEY, BUDDY.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.267
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

00:13.300 --> 00:15.467
HE'LL BE FINE.
I GREW UP IN A TRAILER PARK,

00:15.500 --> 00:17.533
PUT MYSELF THROUGH MED SCHOOL
BY POSING IN MY UNDERWEAR.

00:17.567 --> 00:20.233
I WALK INTO THE O.R.,
EVERYONE HOPES I'M THE NURSE.

00:20.267 --> 00:22.233
(Richard) THE NURSES
ARE OVERWORKED AND UNHAPPY.

00:22.267 --> 00:24.167
SORRY, WE'RE SHORT STAFFED.
UNHAPPY NURSES LEAD TO...

00:24.200 --> 00:26.600
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

00:26.633 --> 00:29.000
WE GO ON STRIKE
IN TEN DAYS.

00:31.433 --> 00:32.533
(Meredith) IN SURGERY

00:32.567 --> 00:34.067
THERE IS A RED LINE
ON THE FLOOR

00:34.100 --> 00:35.833
THAT MARKS THE POINT
WHERE THE HOSPITAL GOES

00:35.867 --> 00:37.500
FROM BEING ACCESSIBLE

00:37.533 --> 00:40.400
TO BEING OFF-LIMITS TO ALL
BUT A SPECIAL FEW.

00:40.433 --> 00:43.367
CROSSING THE LINE UNAUTHORIZED
IS NOT TOLERATED.

00:43.400 --> 00:45.300
(nurses chanting) FAIR HOURS!
FAIR WAGES!

00:45.333 --> 00:48.400
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

00:48.433 --> 00:52.267
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

00:52.300 --> 00:54.733
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

00:54.767 --> 00:57.100
CAN'T... CAN'T CROSS
THE PICKET LINE.

00:57.133 --> 01:00.400
I DON'T LIKE IT EITHER, GEORGE,
BUT WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

01:00.433 --> 01:02.567
OKAY, YOU TOOK AN OATH TO HEAL.
YOU'RE A HEALER.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.500
MY DAD'S A TRUCK DRIVER.
MOM'S A TEACHER.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.433
THE EVENING NEWS SHOWS ME
CROSSING A PICKET LINE,

01:06.467 --> 01:08.567
THEY'LL OUTLIVE ME JUST
TO PEE ON MY GRAVE.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.100
IN GENERAL, LINES ARE THERE
FOR A REASON...

01:11.133 --> 01:12.300
HAS THERE BEEN
ANY BLOOD YET?

01:12.333 --> 01:14.167
I HEAR THEY BROUGHT IN
SCAB NURSES.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.833
FOR SAFETY...

01:15.867 --> 01:17.567
FOR SECURITY...

01:17.600 --> 01:19.633
FOR CLARITY.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.533
I THINK THE NURSES KNOW
THAT WE ARE ON THEIR SIDE.

01:22.567 --> 01:23.733
DON'T THEY?

01:23.767 --> 01:26.400
WE'RE DOCTORS.
WE HAVE SICK PATIENTS INSIDE.

01:26.433 --> 01:27.600
I MEAN, WE HAVE SURGERIES.

01:27.633 --> 01:28.567
OKAY...

01:28.600 --> 01:31.067
THEN YOU GO FIRST.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.833
(nurses) FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

01:32.867 --> 01:33.967
SCREW IT.

01:34.067 --> 01:36.167
(nurses) FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

01:36.200 --> 01:37.667
YEAH, DOING MY JOB.

01:37.700 --> 01:38.800
DOING MY JOB. HA HA.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.800
(nurses) FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

01:40.833 --> 01:42.500
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

01:42.533 --> 01:44.633
THEY THREW FOOD AT HER.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.333
THAT IS JUST WRONG!

01:46.367 --> 01:47.533
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

01:47.567 --> 01:50.233
FINE. I'M GOIN' IN.

01:50.267 --> 01:51.567
CHANGES YOUR OWN BEDPANS,
STEVENS!

01:51.600 --> 01:53.500
YEAH, ENJOY YOUR SYPHILIS,
OLIVIA.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.833
FAIR WAGES...
AAH!

01:55.867 --> 01:58.067
GEORGE, ARE YOU COMING?

01:58.100 --> 01:59.267
NO, I'M GOOD HERE.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.100
IF YOU CHOOSE
TO CROSS THE LINE,

02:01.133 --> 02:03.067
YOU PRETTY MUCH DO SO
AT YOUR OWN RISK.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.233
GOOD MORNING.

02:04.267 --> 02:05.733
MORNING, MEREDITH.

02:05.767 --> 02:07.433
HOW IS SHE TODAY?

02:07.467 --> 02:08.633
SHE'S GREAT.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.567
SHE REALLY LIGHTS UP
WHEN DR. WEBBER VISITS.

02:10.600 --> 02:13.600
(Ellis laughs)
AND I DID NOT BACK DOWN.

02:13.633 --> 02:17.133
NOT IN MY O.R., NOT IN FRONT
OF THOSE JOCK ORTHO IDIOTS.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.400
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME WINDSOR
CALLED YOU "LITTLE LADY,"

02:19.433 --> 02:21.333
NOT EVEN BEHIND YOUR BACK.

02:21.367 --> 02:23.267
ONE DAY, I'M GONNA BE
CHIEF OF SURGERY.

02:23.300 --> 02:25.067
THE FIRST WOMAN CHIEF,
YOU WATCH.

02:25.067 --> 02:26.733
I DON'T DOUBT IT, ELLIS.

02:26.767 --> 02:28.100
SO WHY IS IT...

02:28.133 --> 02:30.433
I DON'T DOUBT IT
FOR A MINUTE.
(laughs)

02:30.467 --> 02:31.800
THAT THE BIGGER THE LINE,

02:31.833 --> 02:33.833
THE GREATER THE TEMPTATION
TO CROSS IT?

02:33.867 --> 02:36.500
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

02:36.533 --> 02:38.200
AND I CAN'T SAY THIS ENOUGH--

02:38.233 --> 02:40.133
CHARTS ARE ORGANIZED
BY ROOM NUMBER.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.333
I KNOW YOU'RE TEMP NURSES,

02:41.367 --> 02:43.133
BUT THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR SLOPPINESS.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.067
DID THEY BRING BACK EDMONDS'
CHART FROM PHYSICAL THERAPY?

02:45.100 --> 02:46.300
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T DO MY JOB
WITHOUT VITALS ON THE CHART.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.133
YOU KNOW WHY I STOPPED
BEING A NURSE? DOCTORS.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.833
DOCTORS WHO DON'T KNOW
HOW TO PITCH IN.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.267
RIGHT. THIS PLACE
IS GOING TO HELL.
THERE SHOULD BE
A BETTER WAY TO COMPROMISE.

02:52.300 --> 02:53.767
WE NEED
THE REAL NURSES BACK.

02:53.800 --> 02:54.867
WE NEED AN ADDITIONAL
40 NURSES

02:54.900 --> 02:57.100
TO RELIEVE THE OVERTIME
THAT THEY'RE STRIKING ABOUT.

02:57.133 --> 02:59.067
THAT'S $2 MILLION A YEAR
WE DON'T HAVE.

02:59.067 --> 03:00.533
HAVE YOU CHECKED
UNDER THE COUCH?

03:00.567 --> 03:02.367
I ALWAYS FIND SPARE CHANGE
UNDER THE CUSHIONS.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.633
OH, OKAY.
AND I'M SILENCING MYSELF.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.833
YES, YES.
UH... THAT'S HIM.

03:08.867 --> 03:10.233
HE'S PUBLISHED TWICE,
AND HE'S FLAWLESS.

03:10.267 --> 03:12.167
OH, I DON'T WANT THAT GUY.
THAT GUY'S A FREAK.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.067
HE DOESN'T LET YOU SPEAK
IN THE O.R.
YEAH, BUT HE'S FLAWLESS.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.133
I THINK IT'S HIM.
WHAT'S HIS NAME AGAIN?

03:16.167 --> 03:18.067
OH, YEAH.
MOUTH BREATHER GUY.

03:18.067 --> 03:21.133
BUT HE'LL LET YOU DO A PROCEDURE
ON YOUR OWN IF HE LIKES YOU.
AH.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.667
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

03:22.700 --> 03:23.833
WHO THEY'RE GONNA PICK
FOR BAILEY'S REPLACEMENT.

03:23.867 --> 03:25.567
(woman) YANG! STEVENS...

03:25.600 --> 03:26.733
GREY, O'MALLEY, KAREV,

03:26.767 --> 03:28.400
HERE YOU ARE.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.233
I WAS LOOKING FOR YOU GUYS
IN THE LOCKER ROOM,

03:31.267 --> 03:32.300
BUT YOU WEREN'T THERE.

03:32.333 --> 03:33.533
AND THEN I THOUGHT,

03:33.567 --> 03:35.467
WELL, MAYBE MY INTERNS
ARE LOOKING FOR ME, TOO.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.233
AND THEN I COME OUT HERE,
AND HERE YOU ARE.

03:38.267 --> 03:41.067
YEAH, YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
A GREAT GROUP, WHICH IS AWESOME.

03:41.067 --> 03:43.400
BECAUSE MY HOROSCOPE SAID IT WAS
GONNA BE A VERY CHALLENGING DAY,

03:43.433 --> 03:45.333
AND I WAS A LITTLE WORRIED,
BUT, NO.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.267
YOU GUYS... YEAH.
YOU LOOK LIKE A GOOD GROUP.

03:47.300 --> 03:49.733
WHICH IS GREAT, 'CAUSE WE'RE
GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

03:49.767 --> 03:51.533
HI! HI. FIRST OF ALL, HI.

03:51.567 --> 03:52.567
OW! OW. OW.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.433
OH. SORRY.
AM I HURTING YOU?

03:54.467 --> 03:57.200
UH, NO, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME.

03:57.233 --> 03:58.433
I'M SYDNEY HERON,
FOURTH YEAR,

03:58.467 --> 04:01.067
AND, UH, MY PHILOSOPHY,
UH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

04:01.100 --> 04:03.533
IS, UM, IS HEAL WITH LOVE.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.500
OKAY. SO, WONDERFUL.

04:05.533 --> 04:07.433
SO ALEX, IZZIE,
MEREDITH, CRISTINA--

04:07.467 --> 04:09.100
AND OUR LITTLE GROUP
IS JUST MISSING--

04:09.133 --> 04:10.600
O'MALLEY.

04:10.633 --> 04:11.767
HE'S COWERING BEHIND
THE STRIKE LINE

04:11.800 --> 04:13.467
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.500
STANDING UP FOR WHAT
HE BELIEVES IN.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.467
THAT'S MY KIND
OF "LITTLE GIRL," RIGHT?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.400
SO... THE E.R. NEEDS SOMEBODY
DOWN THERE FOR A CONSULT.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.200
DOES ANYBODY--
WHO WANTS TO--

04:20.233 --> 04:22.067
WE GET TO PICK?
OH, ME. I'M ON IT.

04:22.100 --> 04:23.300
I'LL HELP.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.700
I HAVE PATIENTS
I NEED TO CHECK ON.

04:25.733 --> 04:28.500
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, IZZIE McGEE.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.700
RIGHT. IT'S, UM,
IT'S STEVENS. IZZIE STEVENS.

04:30.733 --> 04:33.767
OH, NO, I KNEW.
I-I WAS JUST RHYMING.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.333
OH, RHYMING. RIGHT, YEAH.
THAT'S--THAT'S NEAT.

04:36.367 --> 04:37.633
DR. STEVENS.
YEAH.

04:37.667 --> 04:39.400
COULD USE YOU ON A CONSULT.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.433
OKAY, I'M ON IT.
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH.

04:41.467 --> 04:43.267
(woman) ANY AVAILABLE
I.V. NURSE TO O.R. TWO.

04:43.300 --> 04:46.600
YOU NEED A CONSULT
FOR A RASH?
IT'S SPREADING PRETTY FAST.

04:46.633 --> 04:48.767
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S
NOTHING SURGICAL GOING ON.

04:48.800 --> 04:49.800
MRS. SOLOMON.

04:49.833 --> 04:51.200
OH.

04:51.233 --> 04:52.733
OH, GOD.

04:52.767 --> 04:53.833
SORRY.

04:53.867 --> 04:55.533
(clears throat)

04:55.567 --> 04:57.233
WE'RE ON OUR HONEYMOON.
YEAH.

04:57.267 --> 04:58.200
SWEET.

04:58.233 --> 05:01.400
UH, CAN YOU, UM...

05:01.433 --> 05:04.267
DISMOUNT, PLEASE?
YEAH.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.467
OKAY, GREAT.
JUST--AAH!

05:06.500 --> 05:08.833
(woman) L-LEN?

05:08.867 --> 05:11.233
LENNY... I-IS THAT YOU?

05:11.267 --> 05:12.767
(breath rasps)

05:12.800 --> 05:15.567
I'LL GET YOU A NURSE,
MA'AM.

05:16.833 --> 05:19.533
LENNY!

05:19.567 --> 05:22.767
(whimpers)

05:22.800 --> 05:24.533
ARE YOU OKAY, MA'AM?

05:24.567 --> 05:26.067
"GRACE BICKHAM."

05:26.100 --> 05:28.500
MRS. BICKHAM, DO YOU KNOW
WHO YOUR DOCTOR IS?

05:28.533 --> 05:30.433
LENNY...
I DON'T SEE YOUR CHART HERE.

05:30.467 --> 05:32.100
ARE YOU THERE?

05:32.133 --> 05:35.067
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO CALM DOWN FOR ME, OKAY?
LENNY?

05:35.100 --> 05:36.600
IS THAT YOUR HUSBAND?

05:36.633 --> 05:38.533
OH, WHERE IS HE?
HE WAS HERE.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.067
I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK
ANY MOMENT.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.567
YOU'RE HAVING
SOME TROUBLE BREATHING.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.667
I'M GONNA NEED
TO RUN SOME TESTS.
LENNY.

05:44.700 --> 05:47.400
NURSE!
I NEED A NURSE IN HERE.

05:47.433 --> 05:51.300
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

05:51.333 --> 05:55.367
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

05:55.400 --> 05:57.167
YOU CAN GO, GEORGE.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.600
WE WON'T THROW DOUGHNUTS.

05:59.633 --> 06:00.800
NO, I CAN TAKE THE DOUGHNUTS.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.733
THEN WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

06:02.767 --> 06:05.733
TEACHER STRIKE OF '03,
MOM WALKED THE LINE FOR 48 DAYS.

06:05.767 --> 06:07.667
I CAN'T JUST--
I CAN'T CROSS.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.500
SO GO HOME.
I CAN'T GO HOME.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.200
YOU JUST DON'T GO...

06:11.233 --> 06:13.667
YEAH, AND GET KICKED OUT
OF THE PROGRAM,

06:13.700 --> 06:15.600
LOSE MY PLACE AS A RESIDENT.

06:15.633 --> 06:18.100
NO, I'M A DOCTOR.
DON'T DO...

06:18.133 --> 06:19.733
DON'T... DON'T...

06:19.767 --> 06:21.100
(nurses) FAIR HOURS!
FAIR WAGES!

06:21.133 --> 06:22.800
I'M A UNION GUY.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.833
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

06:24.867 --> 06:26.233
SO THAT MEANS...

06:26.267 --> 06:27.733
GIVE ME THAT SIGN.

06:27.767 --> 06:31.267
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

06:31.300 --> 06:34.533
(Olivia) ALL RIGHT,
DR. O'MALLEY.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.233
HELP! I NEED A NURSE
IN HERE, PLEASE.

06:44.267 --> 06:46.133
HER PRESSURE'S FALLING.
SHE'S STOPPED BREATHING.

06:46.167 --> 06:47.400
WHOA. IS SHE DYING?
ARE YOU A NURSE?

06:47.433 --> 06:49.233
UM, I'M, LIKE,
A NURSING STUDENT.

06:49.267 --> 06:51.633
I NEED TO INTUBATE.
GET ME A 7 1/2 TUBE.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.300
THEY'RE OUT IN THE HALL.

06:54.333 --> 06:56.533
(woman) ANY AVAILABLE
I.V. NURSE TO O.R. TWO.

06:56.567 --> 06:59.600
NOT THAT ONE.
THE THAT SAYS "7-5."

07:07.333 --> 07:09.100
I'M IN.

07:09.133 --> 07:10.633
AWESOME.

07:12.467 --> 07:16.300
(heart beating on monitor)

07:16.333 --> 07:17.600
IS THAT TOO MUCH?

07:17.633 --> 07:19.533
IT'S A LOT OF EXTRA
AMNIOTIC FLUID, CHEYENNE,

07:19.567 --> 07:23.067
BUT YOUR BABY LOOKS STRONG.
DOES THAT MEAN
WE CAN GO?

07:23.100 --> 07:24.667
I MEAN, I APPRECIATE YOU
SEEING US, I REALLY DO,

07:24.700 --> 07:26.533
BUT THIS IS
A LONG DRIVE FOR US,

07:26.567 --> 07:28.533
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO MISS ANOTHER SHIFT.

07:28.567 --> 07:30.567
UNFORTUNATELY, MS. WOOD,
THE MASS ON THE BABY'S NECK

07:30.600 --> 07:32.633
IS WHAT'S CAUSING
THE BUILD UP OF FLUID.

07:32.667 --> 07:35.400
IT'S ALSO OBSTRUCTING
HER AIRWAY AND THE SPINE.

07:35.433 --> 07:36.367
MOM.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.333
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET'S LISTEN.

07:38.367 --> 07:41.100
WE'RE GONNA DO A PROCEDURE
CALLED AN EXIT SURGERY.

07:41.133 --> 07:44.400
BASICALLY, WE DO A C-SECTION
AND ONLY HALF DELIVER THE BABY.
HALF DELIVER?

07:44.433 --> 07:46.600
THAT'S RIGHT. WE PULL
THE HEAD AND THE ARMS OUT,

07:46.633 --> 07:49.267
BUT WE DON'T CUT
THE UMBILICAL CORD.
WHY?

07:49.300 --> 07:51.433
THE TUMOR WON'T LET AIR
GET TO THE BABY'S LUNGS,

07:51.467 --> 07:53.467
SO WE NEED THE UMBILICAL CORD
TO KEEP HER ALIVE

07:53.500 --> 07:54.600
DURING THE OPERATION.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.567
IT'S KINDA COOL
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.

07:57.600 --> 07:59.533
YOU'LL BE LIKE YOUR BABY'S
LIFE SUPPORT MACHINE.

07:59.567 --> 08:02.067
AND THEN AFTER THE SURGERY,
IF ALL GOES WELL,

08:02.100 --> 08:03.300
WE CUT THE UMBILICAL CORD

08:03.333 --> 08:05.767
AND YOU'LL BE THE MOTHER
OF A HEALTHY BABY GIRL.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.067
HOW'S THAT SOUND?
IT SOUNDS EXPENSIVE.

08:08.067 --> 08:11.400
WELL, YOUR DOCTOR AT THE CLINIC
IS A FORMER STUDENT OF MINE,

08:11.433 --> 08:13.467
SO... IT'S COVERED.

08:13.500 --> 08:17.067
I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
AND TAKE THIS UP TO THE LAB.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.500
THE HOSPITAL GETS A WRITE-OFF
FOR THE SURGERY,

08:20.533 --> 08:22.433
AND IT MAKES DR. SHEPHERD
LOOK GOOD, SO...

08:22.467 --> 08:24.400
SO IT'S NOT CHARITY?

08:24.433 --> 08:26.700
IT'S NOT CHARITY.
WHAT TIME'S YOUR SHIFT?

08:26.733 --> 08:28.667
6:00 TO 6:00.
GRAVEYARD.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.233
IN CHEHALIS?

08:30.267 --> 08:31.200
YEAH.

08:31.233 --> 08:32.600
THAT'S THREE HOURS AWAY.

08:32.633 --> 08:34.433
YOU BETTER GET GOIN'.

08:34.467 --> 08:35.800
I'LL LOOK OUT FOR HER.

08:43.700 --> 08:45.467
CHIEF.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.233
HELLO, MEREDITH.

08:47.267 --> 08:50.233
SAW MY MOTHER
THIS MORNING.

08:50.267 --> 08:52.267
DID YOU?

08:52.300 --> 08:55.167
HOW IS SHE?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.067
SHE'S FINE.

08:57.067 --> 09:00.500
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

09:00.533 --> 09:03.667
GIVE HER MY BEST.

09:05.733 --> 09:07.333
WHY ARE YOU--

09:07.367 --> 09:09.167
OH, I'M DRAWING A LINE TO MARK
THE BORDERS OF THE INFECTION.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.400
WE'LL WATCH YOU FOR
A COUPLE OF HOURS,

09:10.433 --> 09:13.300
AND IF DOESN'T CROSS THE LINE,
YOU'LL GET I.V. ANTIBIOTICS.

09:13.333 --> 09:14.667
AND IF IT DOES
CROSS THE LINE?

09:14.700 --> 09:16.167
WELL, IT WOULD MEAN
THE INFECTION'S AGGRESSIVE.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.133
WE'D HAVE TO DO
A MUSCLE BIOPSY.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.533
YOU HAVE TO TAKE OUT
A PIECE OF MY MUSCLE?

09:19.567 --> 09:20.600
MM-HMM.

09:20.633 --> 09:22.700
WELL, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO RUN
A 10K TOMORROW, SO--

09:22.733 --> 09:24.267
(Cristina) OH, ON THIS LEG?
I DOUBT IT.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.200
CAN YOU TELL US WHEN
YOU FIRST NOTICED THE RASH?

09:26.233 --> 09:27.800
WHEN WE WERE CLIMBING
RAINIER YESTERDAY.

09:27.833 --> 09:30.333
(Sydney) WOW, YOU GO UP
THE EMMONS GLACIER ROUTE?

09:30.367 --> 09:33.433
PLEASE, YOU CAN DO THAT IN
AN S.U.V. WE DID LIBERTY RIDGE.

09:33.467 --> 09:36.433
WOW. THAT'S HARD CORE.
HI, I'M SYDNEY HERON,

09:36.467 --> 09:37.733
THESE GUYS' TEACHER.
HI.

09:37.767 --> 09:39.400
I'M CLAIRE.
THIS IS WADE.

09:39.433 --> 09:40.467
IT'S OUR HONEYMOON.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.267
WOW. THAT'S AMAZING.
GOD, AND LOOK AT THAT ROCK.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.167
DID YOU SUSTAIN ANY TRAUMA
ON THE HIKE?

09:45.200 --> 09:47.467
DID YOU FALL DOWN OR BANG
YOUR LEG AGAINST SOMETHING?

09:47.500 --> 09:48.533
NO.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.267
WELL, UM, SHE CUT HER FOOT
ON SOME OYSTER SHELLS

09:51.300 --> 09:53.400
AT THE BEACH
A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

09:53.433 --> 09:54.600
WE WERE WINDSURFING
IN PUGET SOUND.

09:54.633 --> 09:57.267
OH, WOW. SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS
ARE GONNA NEED A HONEYMOON

09:57.300 --> 09:59.433
TO RECOVER FROM YOUR HONEYMOON.
OW.

09:59.467 --> 10:01.367
RIGHT?
MY LEG'S GONNA BE OKAY,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

10:01.400 --> 10:04.300
OH, YEAH, YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A SIMPLE SKIN INFECTION.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.333
UH, NO IT'S NOT. LOOK.

10:09.167 --> 10:11.133
OH, HEY.

10:11.167 --> 10:12.400
HEY.

10:12.433 --> 10:13.800
YOUR DOG'S FINE.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.433
HE'S YOUR DOG NOW.
HMM.

10:15.467 --> 10:16.733
I MISS HIM.

10:16.767 --> 10:18.500
(Addison)
HE MISSES YOU, TOO.

10:18.533 --> 10:19.467
(chuckles)

10:19.500 --> 10:21.433
YOU SHOULD COME VISIT.

10:21.467 --> 10:23.500
THE DOG, I MEAN.

10:23.533 --> 10:25.333
I'M WALKING AWAY NOW.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.367
SO, UM...

10:27.400 --> 10:29.033
I'M LOOKING
FOR A NEUROSURGEON

10:29.067 --> 10:31.133
TO CONSULT ON
A FETAL SPINAL TUMOR.

10:31.167 --> 10:33.700
YOU KNOW ANYBODY GOOD?
(chuckles)

10:33.733 --> 10:36.067
(woman) CHARGE NURSE
TO FIVE SOUTH NURSES STATION.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.300
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES...

10:37.333 --> 10:38.533
DON'T ASK GEORGE.

10:38.567 --> 10:39.767
WHY NOT? HE'S A DOCTOR.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.433
I'M WORRIED ABOUT--
JUST ASK.

10:41.467 --> 10:42.567
WHISPER AND POINT.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.600
I'M SHOWING SUPPORT,
THEY WHISPER AND POINT.
GEORGE.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.133
WHAT?
WE NEED A FAVOR.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.067
AVA JENKINS IN PEDS--
ROOM 4114.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.833
IT'S ALMOST TIME
TO CHANGE HER DRESSING,

10:49.867 --> 10:51.067
AND IT'S SCARY FOR HER.

10:51.100 --> 10:53.700
BUT IF YOU SING THE ALPHABET
OR THE WHEELS ON THE BUS SONG,

10:53.733 --> 10:55.233
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

10:55.267 --> 10:56.600
AND MRS. O'BRIEN
FROM 2412,

10:56.633 --> 10:58.533
SHE'LL HAVE
A MAJOR PANIC ATTACK

10:58.567 --> 11:00.467
IF THEY DON'T CHECK ON HER
AT LEAST ONCE AN HOUR.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.400
AND THERE'S THIS GUY
IN 2924--
HANG ON!

11:02.433 --> 11:04.333
HANG ON HERE. WAIT, YOU WANT ME
TO CROSS THE PICKET LINE?

11:04.367 --> 11:05.600
YEAH.
YEAH.

11:05.633 --> 11:06.533
WHY?

11:06.567 --> 11:09.533
BECAUSE THEY'RE
OUR PATIENTS, TOO, GEORGE.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.733
AND WE CAN'T.

11:12.767 --> 11:14.400
(Sydney) ANYONE CARE
TO PROBE THE WOUND?

11:14.433 --> 11:16.100
I DO.
I DO.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.167
I'D REALLY LIKE TO TRY YOUR
METHOD OF HEALING WITH LOVE.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.067
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU THINK, ALEX.

11:20.100 --> 11:22.133
YOU DO THE HONORS.
(scoffs)

11:22.167 --> 11:24.533
CRISTINA, LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
NEEDS TO LEARN HOW TO SHARE.

11:24.567 --> 11:25.767
(telephone rings)

11:25.800 --> 11:28.300
OKAY, GOOD. JUST GO AHEAD
AND SLIDE IT IN.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.367
WHOA. NO RESISTANCE.
LET ME SEE.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.533
(woman) DR. HERON.
LET ME SEE.

11:32.567 --> 11:35.500
YES.
NO HEALTHY MUSCLE
GIVES WAY THAT EASILY.

11:35.533 --> 11:36.800
OH, MY GOD.
OH, THIS POOR GIRL.

11:36.833 --> 11:38.733
OKAY, EVERYONE,
WE'RE LOCKING DOWN THE O.R.

11:38.767 --> 11:41.267
ALL NONESSENTIAL PERSONNEL
MUST LEAVE NOW.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.200
IS THAT PATHOLOGY? IS IT--
IT'S NECROTIZING FASCIITIS.

11:43.233 --> 11:45.433
THE FLESH-EATING BACTERIA?

11:45.467 --> 11:47.633
IN THE FLESH.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.300
OH, GOOD.

11:49.333 --> 11:52.133
SOMEBODY'S IN HERE.
HOW'S SHE DOING?

11:52.167 --> 11:53.700
YOU INTUBATED HER?

11:53.733 --> 11:55.200
YEAH.
YOU INTUBATED HER?

11:55.233 --> 11:57.133
I HAD TO--SHE WAS
STRUGGLING TO BREATHE,

11:57.167 --> 11:59.733
HER SATs WERE IN THE 80s,
SHE WAS IN A ROOM ALL ALONE.

11:59.767 --> 12:01.067
WHAT?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.400
ONE OF THE TEMP NURSES FOUND
THE PAPERWORK FROM HER CHART

12:03.433 --> 12:05.300
ON THE SECOND FLOOR AND--
YOU PUT A TUBE IN GRACE.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.233
SHE PUT A TUBE IN GRACE?

12:07.267 --> 12:09.167
SHE PUT A TUBE IN GRACE?

12:09.200 --> 12:12.500
MRS. BICKHAM WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH END-STAGE C.O.P.D.

12:12.533 --> 12:14.233
SHE'S ON HOSPICE.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.233
END-OF-LIFE CARE?

12:16.267 --> 12:18.467
D.N.R.--
DO NOT RESUSCITATE.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.400
YOU LITTLE SCHNOOK.

12:20.433 --> 12:23.500
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO LET HER DIE.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.133
"NO MACHINES," SHE SAID.

12:26.167 --> 12:27.667
SHE DID, I REMEMBER.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.833
BECAUSE HER DAUGHTER ALICE WAS
THERE WITH HER GIRLFRIEND--

12:29.867 --> 12:33.333
UH, SHE'S A LESBIAN,
THE DAUGHTER--

12:33.367 --> 12:34.333
NICE GIRLS.

12:34.367 --> 12:36.500
STOP WITH THE RAMBLING, AGNES.
MAKE YOUR POINT.

12:36.533 --> 12:38.200
I'M SORRY.

12:38.233 --> 12:40.800
WHO ARE YOU EXACTLY?

12:40.833 --> 12:42.333
MRS. BICKHAM'S SISTERS?

12:42.367 --> 12:43.700
OH, NO.

12:43.733 --> 12:45.767
NO, HER SISTER ROSE DIED
IN '83.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.700
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.
INFLUENZA. OR CROUP.

12:48.733 --> 12:50.500
ONLY BABIES DIE OF CROUP.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.433
ROSE DIED WITH A COLD
IN HER CHEST.

12:52.467 --> 12:53.633
PNEUMONIA.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.167
RIGHT, PNEUMONIA.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.633
AND THEN THERE WAS
HER OTHER SISTER HARRIET.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.800
MAY SHE REST IN PEACE.
THEY CREMATED HER.

12:59.833 --> 13:01.400
GRACIE WANTED TO DIE.

13:01.433 --> 13:03.733
SHE MADE US ALL PROMISE.

13:03.767 --> 13:04.700
THIS REALLY IS SOMETHING

13:04.733 --> 13:06.767
THAT I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH HER HUSBAND ABOUT.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.700
LENNY NEVER TALKED MUCH
WHEN HE WAS ALIVE.

13:08.733 --> 13:10.467
GOOD LUCK
GETTIN' A WORD NOW.

13:10.500 --> 13:12.400
LENNY'S DEAD?

13:12.433 --> 13:14.233
MAY HE REST IN PEACE.

13:14.267 --> 13:15.633
BUT GRACE SAID
SHE JUST SAW HIM.

13:15.667 --> 13:18.233
BECAUSE SHE WAS TRYING
TO CROSS OVER.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.167
SHE ALMOST DIED
TWICE IN THE LAST MONTH,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.067
SAID SHE SAW HIM EACH TIME.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.433
YOU ASK ME,
THAT'S A LITTLE MESHUGANA.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.367
IT'S NOT MESHUGANA.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.700
HE WAS WAITIN' FOR HER
IN THE LIGHT.

13:28.733 --> 13:31.800
MM-HMM, WHICH, THANKS TO YOU,
SHE CAN'T REACH NOW.

13:36.467 --> 13:39.333
O'MALLEY, I NEED YOU TO ROUND
ON ROOM 20--
I'M NOT HERE.

13:39.367 --> 13:40.767
EXCUSE ME?
I'M HERE,
BUT I'M NOT HERE.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.533
YOU WON'T BE ANYWHERE
IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS IF YOU--

13:43.567 --> 13:45.467
SIR, ALL DUE RESPECT,
NO OFFENSE INTENDED,

13:45.500 --> 13:48.200
UH... BUT I WON'T CROSS
A PICKET LINE.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.667
AND YET SOMEHOW,
YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF ME.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.600
WELL, YEAH,
BECAUSE SOME OF THE NURSES

13:52.633 --> 13:54.533
WANTED ME TO CHECK ON
THEIR PATIENTS, AND SO I AM,

13:54.567 --> 13:56.700
BUT THEN I'M GOING RIGHT BACK
OUT THERE TO JOIN THEM.
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.400
YES, SIR.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.333
BUT I'M ALSO A UNION MAN.

14:00.367 --> 14:03.567
ALL DUE RESPECT.
THERE'S NO OFFENSE INTENDED.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.133
FINE.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.133
SIR...

14:07.167 --> 14:09.167
WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE,
I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL YOU

14:09.200 --> 14:11.533
THAT, UH, MRS. O'BRIEN IN 2412
IS ALLERGIC TO CHOCOLATE,

14:11.567 --> 14:13.500
BUT SHE PULLS
THE ALLERGY STICKER

14:13.533 --> 14:15.433
OFF HER CHART
EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS.

14:15.467 --> 14:16.400
WONDERFUL.

14:16.433 --> 14:17.767
AND, UH, THAT MISTER--

14:17.800 --> 14:19.700
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO WATCH
MR. ROBERTS IN 2119

14:19.733 --> 14:21.467
TAKE AND SWALLOW
HIS DIURETICS.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.667
APPARENTLY HE LIKES TO
HOARD THEM UNDER HIS MATTRESS--

14:23.700 --> 14:25.633
IS THAT IT?

14:25.667 --> 14:27.567
40 TO 50 HOURS
OF MANDATORY OVERTIME

14:27.600 --> 14:29.233
IS EXTREMELY--
O'MALLEY.

14:29.267 --> 14:32.167
YES, SIR, I'M VERY SORRY.
THERE'S NO OFFENSE INTENDED.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.467
WHAT? WAIT,
FLESH-EATING...

14:33.500 --> 14:35.800
I MEAN, THIS IS SOME KIND
OF JOKE, RIGHT?

14:35.833 --> 14:37.333
SHE PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

14:37.367 --> 14:39.667
NO, IT'S NOT A JOKE.
WE HAVE TO AMPUTATE THE LEG.

14:39.700 --> 14:40.633
CRISTINA...

14:40.667 --> 14:42.633
WE'RE ON OUR HONEYMOON.

14:42.667 --> 14:44.533
I'M SORRY, WADE.
I KNOW THIS IS SCARY.

14:44.567 --> 14:47.067
BUT AMPUTATION IS NOT
THE ONLY OPTION.
IT'S THE ONLY SANE OP--
EXCUSE ME.

14:47.100 --> 14:49.433
IF WE DON'T GET THIS INFECTION
UNDER CONTROL IMMEDIATELY,

14:49.467 --> 14:52.167
SHE IS GOING TO DIE.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.467
BUT THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION?

14:53.500 --> 14:55.167
(Alex) WELL, WE CAN TRY
TO SAVE THE LEG

14:55.200 --> 14:57.100
BY CUTTING OUT THE INFECTION.
IT WON'T BE PRETTY,

14:57.133 --> 14:59.467
BUT WE MIGHT BE ABLE
TO KEEP IT FUNCTIONAL.
GOLD STAR FOR DR. KAREV.

14:59.500 --> 15:01.767
I-I NEED TO SEE HER.
THERE'S NO TIME.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.833
BY THE TIME WE TAKE HER
OUT OF ANESTHESIA

15:03.867 --> 15:06.733
AND PUT HER BACK UNDER--
YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION NOW.

15:06.767 --> 15:10.500
I MEAN, SHE RUNS MARATHONS.
THIS IS OUR ADVENTURE HONEYMOON.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.667
IT'S... I MEAN,
IT'S WHO SHE IS.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.067
OKAY.

15:14.100 --> 15:18.067
THEN WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO SAVE THE LEG.

15:22.133 --> 15:24.067
YOU SERIOUSLY THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA?

15:24.067 --> 15:27.700
I SERIOUSLY THINK THIS IS
A WAY COOLER SURGERY.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.767
CHEYENNE, THE PROGNOSIS
IS VERY GOOD.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.133
SO WHAT WE WANT TO TRY TO DO
IS GO IN AND GET

15:32.167 --> 15:35.067
AS MUCH OF THE TUMOR OUT
AS POSSIBLE DURING YOUR SURGERY.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.733
SO MY BABY WILL BE FINE?
YES.

15:36.767 --> 15:39.333
YOU MAY BE ABLE TO TAKE
YOUR BABY HOME

15:39.367 --> 15:41.267
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.
THAT SOON?

15:41.300 --> 15:43.200
ABSOLUTELY.
SHE'LL BE ALL YOURS.

15:43.233 --> 15:44.633
OH.

15:44.667 --> 15:46.767
OKAY.
(Derek) OKAY.

15:46.800 --> 15:48.800
NOW IF YOU OR YOUR MOTHER
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

15:48.833 --> 15:51.700
DR. STEVENS WILL PAGE ME,
ALL RIGHT? (Addison) SEE YOU
LATER.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.067
WOW. SHAKESPEARE.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.833
I WAS READING IT
TO MY BABY.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.467
IT'S REALLY HOMEWORK
FOR ENGLISH.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.367
WAS.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.567
THE BABY WASN'T DUE
FOR ANOTHER THREE MORE WEEKS.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.233
BUT NOW I GUESS...

16:05.267 --> 16:06.400
NO MORE SCHOOL.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.133
IT'S WEIRD.

16:08.167 --> 16:11.733
IT'S LIKE
WHEN YOU'RE IN SCHOOL...

16:11.767 --> 16:13.300
YOU HATE IT.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.367
UNTIL YOU CAN'T GO ANYMORE.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.700
HAVE YOU MADE ANY PLANS?

16:17.733 --> 16:18.667
PLANS?

16:18.700 --> 16:20.633
BOUGHT A CRIB,

16:20.667 --> 16:22.567
CALLED ABOUT CHILD CARE,
LOOKED INTO ASSISTANCE.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.667
NOT YET.

16:24.700 --> 16:27.267
ARE YOU GONNA LIVE
WITH YOUR MOM?

16:27.300 --> 16:28.767
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
SAVING MONEY

16:28.800 --> 16:30.533
TO GET MY OWN TRAILER HOME.

16:30.567 --> 16:33.600
BUT I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I
JUST THOUGHT I'D HAVE MORE TIME.

16:33.633 --> 16:35.800
NINE MONTHS GOES BY FAST.

16:35.833 --> 16:38.400
YEAH.

16:38.433 --> 16:41.667
YEAH, IT DOES.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.100
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.700
BYE.

16:51.133 --> 16:54.367
SO, SYDNEY, HAVE YOU SEEN
A LOT OF NECROTIZING FASCIITIS?

16:54.400 --> 16:55.800
NO, HAVE YOU?

16:58.400 --> 17:00.433
IF THE INFECTION MOVES TO
HER BLOODSTREAM, SHE'LL DIE.

17:00.467 --> 17:03.300
IF SHE WAKES UP WITHOUT HER LEG,
SHE MIGHT WISH SHE HAD.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.367
YEAH, DR. KAREV IS RIGHT.
SHE'S YOUNG, SHE'S HEALTHY,

17:05.400 --> 17:08.267
SHE'S A NEWLYWED.
AND YOUR TREATMENT PLAN
IS BASED ON... CUTENESS?

17:08.300 --> 17:11.167
IF SHE WERE AN 80-YEAR-OLD MAN,
YOU'D AMPUTATE IN A HEARTBEAT.

17:11.200 --> 17:13.533
SHE'S NOT 80.
WHERE'S YOUR COMPASSION?

17:13.567 --> 17:14.767
MY COMPASSION?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.767
TRYING TO SAVE A PATIENT
FROM DEATH

17:16.800 --> 17:17.600
IS PRETTY COMPASSIONATE.

17:17.633 --> 17:19.700
I MUST SAY,
I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

17:19.733 --> 17:21.400
WHY CAN'T YOU BE
MORE LIKE ALEX?

17:21.433 --> 17:23.200
EXCUSE ME?

17:23.233 --> 17:25.133
YEAH. THIS GUY,
HE'S COMPASSIONATE, HE'S WARM.

17:25.167 --> 17:27.067
HE'S FIGHTING WITH ME
TO SAVE CLAIRE'S LEG.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.233
AND WE'RE GONNA WIN
THAT FIGHT.
YES.

17:33.233 --> 17:36.200
UM, EXCUSE ME. RESTROOM.

17:36.233 --> 17:37.300
BURKE.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.233
HEY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN SURGERY.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.633
I WAS.
NECROTIZING FASCIITIS.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.467
YOU'RE KIDDING?

17:43.500 --> 17:45.400
SO WHY ARE YOU OUT HERE?

17:45.433 --> 17:46.600
BECAUSE THE NEW RESIDENT--

17:46.633 --> 17:48.300
SHE'S THE NEW BAILEY,

17:48.333 --> 17:50.233
EXCEPT THAT SHE'S
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF BAILEY

17:50.267 --> 17:52.167
IN THE MOST ABSURD,
HORRIFYING,

17:52.200 --> 17:53.367
PROFOUNDLY DISTURBING WAYS.

17:53.400 --> 17:54.367
CRISTINA--

17:54.400 --> 17:58.233
I THINK THE NEW RESIDENT
IS KILLING OUR PATIENT.

18:05.200 --> 18:06.700
DR. HERON, IS IT?

18:06.733 --> 18:07.800
IT IS. AND YOU ARE?

18:07.833 --> 18:09.467
PRESTON BURKE.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.400
DR. BURKE.
WOW. NO KIDDING?

18:11.433 --> 18:12.567
I'M A HUGE FAN.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.267
THANK YOU.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.667
I, UM, I HEARD YOU HAD
A CASE OF NECROTIZING FASCIITIS.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.433
WE DON'T SEE A LOT OF THOSE
AROUND HERE.

18:19.467 --> 18:22.267
HMM, YEAH, WELL, BEING
A CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON,

18:22.300 --> 18:26.267
I WOULDN'T THINK
YOU SAW ANY.

18:26.300 --> 18:28.333
RIGHT.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.833
WELL, UM...

18:29.867 --> 18:31.767
I WAS JUST CURIOUS
ON WHAT PROTOCOL

18:31.800 --> 18:33.633
YOU WERE FOLLOWING HERE.

18:33.667 --> 18:36.233
YOU WERE CURIOUS
OR CRISTINA WAS CONCERNED?

18:36.267 --> 18:38.167
I HOPE YOU'LL FORGIVE
THE INTRUSION.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.767
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

18:39.800 --> 18:42.433
IT'S JUST... WE HAVEN'T
WORKED WITH YOU BEFORE,

18:42.467 --> 18:44.467
AND DR. YANG WANTED
TO BE SURE THAT--

18:44.500 --> 18:45.600
DR. YANG WANTED TO BE SURE

18:45.633 --> 18:47.500
THAT THE PERKY LITTLE
BIMBO CHEERLEADER WASN'T IN HERE

18:47.533 --> 18:49.067
TRYING TO KILL A PATIENT,
AM I RIGHT?

18:49.100 --> 18:51.167
NOW WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
DR. BURKE,

18:51.200 --> 18:52.533
I KNOW YOU DON'T KNOW ME
VERY WELL,

18:52.567 --> 18:54.467
BUT I'M PRETTY GOOD
AT WHAT I DO.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.400
AND MY PATIENT IS
A 25-YEAR-OLD MARATHONER,

18:56.433 --> 18:58.667
AND I'VE TOLD HER HUSBAND
I'M GONNA TRY AND SAVE HER LEG.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.600
SO MY PLAN IS TO STAND HERE
FOR AS MANY HOURS AS IT TAKES

19:00.633 --> 19:02.567
TO SCRAPE AWAY EVERY LAST CELL
OF NECROTIC FLESH.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.067
NOW WHEN I'M DONE,
IF IT'S STILL SPREADING,

19:05.067 --> 19:06.733
THEN WE'LL TAKE THE LEG,
AND IF WE DO,

19:06.767 --> 19:09.367
THEN OUR EAGER YOUNG INTERN
HERE CAN HOLD THE SAW.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.133
NOW UNLIKE DR. KAREV,
KINDNESS AND COMPASSION

19:11.167 --> 19:12.633
AREN'T VERY HIGH
ON HER LIST OF PRIORITIES,

19:12.667 --> 19:14.567
BUT A LITTLE BONE SAW ACTION--

19:14.600 --> 19:16.800
WELL, MAYBE THAT'LL EARN ME
SOME RESPECT,

19:16.833 --> 19:18.267
AM I RIGHT?

19:19.833 --> 19:23.133
NOW, DR. YANG,
YOU READY TO SCRUB BACK IN?

19:23.167 --> 19:25.667
THANK YOU.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.767
YOU'RE THE HEAD
OF THIS WHOLE HOSPITAL?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.367
JUST THE SURGEONS.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.333
WELL, THEY SHOULD MAKE YOU
THE HEAD OF EVERYTHING.

19:32.367 --> 19:34.267
SHE'S BATTING HER LASHES.
YOU SEE THAT?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.500
SHE'S BATTING HER LASHES.

19:35.533 --> 19:38.133
DR. WEBBER, THE POINT IS, GRACE
WANTS TO BE WITH HER LENNY.

19:38.167 --> 19:39.267
SHE MISSES HIM TERRIBLY.

19:39.300 --> 19:42.833
YOU REALIZE, IF I PULL OUT
THE TUBE, GRACE WILL DIE?

19:42.867 --> 19:44.733
WE'RE OLD, MAGPIE,
NOT DAFT.

19:44.767 --> 19:47.533
PULL THE PLUG ALREADY.
IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.567
LADIES, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN FOR YOUR FRIEND,

19:49.600 --> 19:53.067
BUT WE NEED TO CONTACT
THE DURABLE POWER OF ATTORNEY

19:53.067 --> 19:54.533
TO SIGN THE RELEASE.

19:54.567 --> 19:55.767
THAT'S ALICE. CALL ALICE.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.433
GRACE'S DAUGHTER.

19:57.467 --> 19:58.733
SHE'S A LESBIAN.

19:58.767 --> 20:00.267
WELL, THAT'S OKAY,
ISN'T IT?

20:00.300 --> 20:03.233
I MEAN, SHE COULD STILL HAVE
THE POWER OF ATTORNEY.

20:03.267 --> 20:06.033
UH, FINE. BUT WE'LL NEED
ALICE'S SIGNATURE.

20:06.067 --> 20:08.633
GOOD LUCK.
SHE LIVES IN OREGON.
OH, SHE COULD FAX IT.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.567
I'M SORRY, WE'LL NEED
HER ORIGINAL SIGNATURE.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.633
OH, CAN'T WE JUST
SKIP THAT PART?

20:13.667 --> 20:17.300
BAT THE LASHES AGAIN.
I THINK IT WAS WORKING.

20:17.333 --> 20:20.600
(Richard)
EXCUSE ME, LADIES.

20:20.633 --> 20:22.533
YOU'RE LIKE
THE OLD LADY WHISPERER.

20:22.567 --> 20:24.633
THEY REALLY CHEER UP
WHEN YOU COME AROUND.

20:24.667 --> 20:26.567
MEREDITH, YOU UNDERSTAND

20:26.600 --> 20:28.500
IF THE DAUGHTER
SHOWS UP TOMORROW,

20:28.533 --> 20:30.433
CONFIRMS SHE'S D.N.R. THAT--

20:30.467 --> 20:34.700
I HAVE TO KILL MY PATIENT,
I KNOW.

20:34.733 --> 20:36.233
HOW YOU DOING?

20:36.267 --> 20:38.167
SOMETHING I CAN DO
FOR YOU?

20:38.200 --> 20:39.500
OH, I'M FINE, SIR.

20:39.533 --> 20:41.433
I DON'T NEED ANY HELP
FROM YOU.

20:41.467 --> 20:43.033
THANK YOU.

20:43.067 --> 20:45.233
"AND, ON MY LIFE,
HIS MALICE 'GAINST THE LADY

20:45.267 --> 20:46.467
"WILL SUDDENLY BREAK FORTH.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.133
"SIR, FARE YOU WELL:

20:48.167 --> 20:50.067
"HEREAFTER,
IN A BETTER WORLD THAN THIS,

20:50.100 --> 20:52.200
"I SHALL DESIRE MORE LOVE
AND KNOWLEDGE OF YOU."

20:55.333 --> 20:56.533
(woman) TO DR. O'MALLEY!

20:56.567 --> 20:58.200
(all) O'MALLEY!

20:58.233 --> 20:59.433
(man) WHOO!

20:59.467 --> 21:01.233
(Cristina)
SHE CALLED ME UNKIND--

21:01.267 --> 21:04.133
UNKIND AND LACKING IN COMPASSION
IN FRONT OF MY BOYFRIEND.

21:04.167 --> 21:06.433
I AM NOT UNKIND.

21:06.467 --> 21:09.067
I THINK I HAVE TO KILL
A WOMAN TOMORROW.

21:09.100 --> 21:12.333
I HAVE TO TAKE OUT THE TUBE
THAT'S KEEPING HER ALIVE.

21:12.367 --> 21:14.533
***

21:14.567 --> 21:16.200
(Cristina) IZZIE.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.400
THIS IS THE PART WHERE YOU
SAY WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

21:18.433 --> 21:20.767
***

21:20.800 --> 21:22.267
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:22.300 --> 21:24.600
I HAVE TO--I FORGOT
SOMETHING AT WORK.

21:24.633 --> 21:25.800
WE DON'T NEED HER.

21:25.833 --> 21:27.733
I HAVE TO KILL
A WOMAN TOMORROW.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.667
YOU KNOW, AND THAT'S
A PROBLEM WHY?

21:29.700 --> 21:32.500
I MEAN, IF IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS,
IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.833
AND THAT IS NOT UNKIND
OR LACKING IN COMPASSION.

21:34.867 --> 21:38.267
I'M A VERY COMPASSIONATE
PERSON.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.200
I'M MORE COMPASSIONATE
THAN YOU, ALEX.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.600
OH, SHUT YOUR
PIE HOLE, YANG.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.533
HEY, JOE, COULD WE HAVE
ANOTHER ROUND, PLEASE?

21:43.567 --> 21:45.467
YEAH, GIVE NURSE O'MALLEY
A DRINK ON ME.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.700
(chuckles)
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

21:48.733 --> 21:51.833
HEY, UH, KAREV
JUST CALLED ME A NURSE.

21:51.867 --> 21:53.500
(man) AT LEAST NURSES
AREN'T BUTCHERS.

21:53.533 --> 21:55.800
IS THAT THE WORST
YOU COULD COME UP WITH?

21:55.833 --> 21:57.500
OH, WAIT,
WAS THAT AN INSULT

21:57.533 --> 22:00.400
OR WAS THAT, UH,
SUPPOSED TO BE FUNNY?
OH, WHOOPS.

22:00.433 --> 22:03.567
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
I WILL KILL YOU, YOU KNOW THAT?

22:03.600 --> 22:05.133
BRING IT ON.
OH, JEEZ--

22:05.167 --> 22:07.467
OH, "BRING IT ON."
OKAY, MAMA.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.233
LET'S BRING IT ON.
OH, LOOK, THERE'S YOUR SQUAD.

22:09.267 --> 22:11.233
WHAT, DO YOU WANT TO
CHEER IT UP, SOCCER MOM?

22:11.267 --> 22:13.800
OH, SOCCER MOM.
ARE YOU GONNA THROW DOWN
SOME BED PANS?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.633
(Joe) WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.600
HEY! IF YOU'RE GONNA BEAT
EACH OTHER UP,

22:17.633 --> 22:20.500
THERE'S NOT GONNA BE ANYBODY
LEFT TO SET YOUR BROKEN BONES.

22:20.533 --> 22:21.700
THAT WOULD BE MY JOB!
AM I RIGHT?

22:21.733 --> 22:24.433
I'M RIGHT. HEY!
WHAT HURTS?
IT'S A LITTLE BITTY BONE.

22:24.467 --> 22:26.333
(singsongy voice)
WE WERE JUST LEAVING.

22:26.367 --> 22:28.367
YEAH, 'CAUSE I GOTTA GO
SAVE LIVES.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.233
BYE.
(George) PARDON ME.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.833
EXCUSE ME. THEY'RE MY RIDE.
I GOTTA GO. EXCUSE ME.

22:31.867 --> 22:35.467
***

22:39.267 --> 22:40.700
YOU'RE AWAKE.

22:40.733 --> 22:42.433
HEY, YEAH.

22:42.467 --> 22:45.733
THE BABY JUMPS UP AND DOWN
IN MY BELLY ALL NIGHT.

22:45.767 --> 22:47.700
MAKES ME HAVE TO PEE
ALL THE TIME.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.233
YOU WORK LONG HOURS, HUH?

22:49.267 --> 22:50.767
YEAH.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.633
BUT I'M OFF WORK NOW,
ONLY...

22:53.667 --> 22:56.400
I JUST CAME BACK
TO TALK TO YOU.

22:56.433 --> 22:59.533
I GREW UP IN CHEHALIS, TOO.

22:59.567 --> 23:00.733
SERIOUS?
SERIOUS.

23:00.767 --> 23:03.367
UM, FOREST PARK.

23:03.400 --> 23:06.333
THE TRAILER PARK
BEHIND THE CHURCH.
YEAH, BEHIND THE CHURCH

23:06.367 --> 23:09.367
ON ROUTE 6, YEAH.
MY FRIEND SHELLEY
LIVES UP THERE.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.300
YEAH, MY MOM
STILL LIVES THERE.
NO WAY.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.367
YEAH.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.467
(laughs)

23:19.867 --> 23:21.633
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

23:29.533 --> 23:32.267
THIS IS MY DAUGHTER.

23:40.433 --> 23:42.200
IN THE PICTURE, SHE'S 6,

23:42.233 --> 23:44.567
BUT SHE'S 11 NOW.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.733
SHE LIVED IN SANTA BARBARA,

23:46.767 --> 23:49.433
BUT THEY MOVED.

23:49.467 --> 23:51.833
I DON'T KNOW WHERE.

23:51.867 --> 23:54.200
BUT I KNOW
HER NAME IS HANNAH.

23:54.233 --> 23:56.133
AND SHE LIKES PIGS.

23:56.167 --> 23:57.100
PIGS?

23:57.133 --> 23:58.600
YEP. SHE COLLECTS THEM.

23:58.633 --> 24:01.467
LIKE FIGURINES
OR STUFFED ANIMALS, YOU KNOW?

24:01.500 --> 24:03.133
I THINK IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE

24:03.167 --> 24:05.700
HER MOM
READ HER "CHARLOTTE'S WEB."

24:05.733 --> 24:08.267
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
HER MOM.

24:08.300 --> 24:11.467
I'M HER MOTHER.

24:11.500 --> 24:14.067
BUT I'M NOT HER MOM.

24:16.300 --> 24:17.767
LOOK...

24:17.800 --> 24:21.433
I KNOW THAT WHERE WE
COME FROM...

24:21.467 --> 24:25.400
THIS KIND OF THING
DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT.

24:25.433 --> 24:27.267
BUT I WANTED YOU TO KNOW

24:27.300 --> 24:31.267
THAT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY
TO BE A GOOD MOTHER.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.767
I WANTED--

24:32.800 --> 24:37.400
I WANTED BETTER FOR HER
THAN I COULD DO AT 16.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.633
I LOVE MY BABY.

24:41.667 --> 24:44.667
OF COURSE YOU DO.

24:44.700 --> 24:47.633
BUT YOU'RE
READING HER SHAKESPEARE.

24:49.267 --> 24:52.133
WHEN YOU'RE WORKING
12-HOUR SHIFTS AT THE DINER

24:52.167 --> 24:54.267
LIKE OUR MOMS,

24:54.300 --> 24:58.167
YOU WON'T BE COMING HOME
AND READING HER SHAKESPEARE.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.167

25:09.167 --> 25:11.067

25:11.100 --> 25:12.500
OH.

25:12.533 --> 25:14.600
I COULD HEAR YOU
FROM SIX BLOCKS AWAY.

25:14.633 --> 25:16.333
SORRY.

25:16.367 --> 25:18.300
DON'T BE. I LIKE IT.

25:18.333 --> 25:21.533
UM, I'M JUST NOT SURE
HOW THE NEIGHBORS WOULD FEEL.

25:21.567 --> 25:23.833
WHICH... BY THE WAY,

25:23.867 --> 25:26.367
IS NOT A THING SOMEONE
LACKING IN COMPASSION

25:26.400 --> 25:28.533
WOULD BE CONCERNED WITH.

25:28.567 --> 25:30.600
HOW'S YOUR PATIENT'S LEG?

25:30.633 --> 25:34.533
CARVED ALL TO HELL,
BUT STILL ON HER BODY.

25:34.567 --> 25:37.467
OH, WE'RE WATCHING IT
OVERNIGHT.

25:37.500 --> 25:40.533
***

25:40.567 --> 25:44.100
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:44.133 --> 25:45.733
***

25:45.767 --> 25:47.833
NEVER IN MY CAREER
HAVE I QUESTIONED

25:47.867 --> 25:51.333
A FELLOW SURGEON
IN THEIR O.R.

25:51.367 --> 25:54.433
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS--

25:54.467 --> 25:58.400
AN INTERN DATING AN ATTENDING--

25:58.433 --> 26:00.433
UNTIL TODAY.

26:00.467 --> 26:04.800
***

26:08.167 --> 26:11.167
(nurses) FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

26:11.200 --> 26:13.067
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

26:13.100 --> 26:14.833
AND DON'T BELIEVE 2519
WHEN SHE TELLS YOU

26:14.867 --> 26:16.533
THAT SHE WENT
TO THE BATHROOM.

26:16.567 --> 26:17.733
SHE JUST WANTS
TO GO HOME.

26:17.767 --> 26:19.667
SHE JUST SAYS SHE WENT
TO THE BATHROOM,

26:19.700 --> 26:21.600
AND THEN SHE'S BACK HERE
TWO DAYS LATER.
GOT IT.

26:21.633 --> 26:23.300
HEY, I NEED SUTURES IN 2602.

26:23.333 --> 26:24.567
CAN'T HELP YOU.

26:26.233 --> 26:27.667
WHAT?

26:27.700 --> 26:29.533
FAIR HOURS! FAIR WAGES!

26:29.567 --> 26:32.100
FAIR HOURS! FAIR...

26:32.133 --> 26:33.133
(sighs)

26:33.167 --> 26:34.300
IT'S NO OFFENSE.

26:34.333 --> 26:37.067
NONE TAKEN.

26:38.833 --> 26:40.733
(laughs) HEY.
HOW'S THE STRIKE GOING?

26:40.767 --> 26:44.433
DO YOU KNOW--
DO YOU REALIZE HOW RARELY

26:44.467 --> 26:46.533
DOCTORS SAY "THANK YOU"
AND "PLEASE" TO NURSES?

26:46.567 --> 26:49.600
HOW FEW SURGEONS EVEN KNOW
THE NAMES OF...

26:49.633 --> 26:52.400
I SHOULDN'T BE SEEN
TALKING TO YOU.

26:52.433 --> 26:53.367
(chuckles)

26:53.400 --> 26:56.067
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING
FOR RICHARD WEBBER.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.167
CAN I HELP YOU?

26:57.200 --> 26:59.133
MY NAME IS ALICE BICKHAM.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.633
I'M HERE
ABOUT MY MOTHER GRACE.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.767
SURE. UM...

27:04.800 --> 27:07.300
COME WITH ME, PLEASE.

27:11.367 --> 27:13.267
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
LOOK AFTER HER.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.467
I'M SORRY.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.400
YOU TOLD ME TO GO TO WORK,

27:16.433 --> 27:19.300
AND YOU SAID
YOU WOULD LOOK AFTER HER.

27:19.333 --> 27:22.067
MS. WOODS, UM, CAN YOU--

27:22.100 --> 27:24.400
JUST FOLLOW ME.

27:26.067 --> 27:27.267
SHE'S A KID, YOU KNOW?

27:27.300 --> 27:30.600
SHE'S SCARED ENOUGH WITHOUT
YOU PUTTING IDEAS IN HER HEAD.

27:30.633 --> 27:33.533
HOW DO YOU TELL A SCARED KID
TO GIVE HER BABY AWAY?

27:33.567 --> 27:35.467
I DIDN'T TELL HER.
I DIDN'T ADVISE HER.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.667
I DIDN'T PRESSURE HER.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.633
I JUST... TALKED TO HER.

27:39.667 --> 27:42.233
YOU'RE NOT A SHRINK.
YOU'RE NOT HER MOTHER.

27:42.267 --> 27:45.300
SHE'S MY KID,
AND YOU CROSSED THE LINE.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.233
I'M SORRY.

27:47.267 --> 27:48.833
NO, YOU'RE NOT SORRY.
YOU'RE SUPERIOR.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.767
SO WHAT,
YOU'RE A BIG-SHOT DOCTOR,

27:50.800 --> 27:51.767
AND YOU GET TO JUDGE US?

27:51.800 --> 27:55.433
YOU GET TO TELL MY KID
HOW TO LIVE HER LIFE?

27:55.467 --> 27:56.633
CHEYENNE IS SMART.

27:56.667 --> 27:58.567
SHE'S SMART
AND SHE'S THOUGHTFUL,

27:58.600 --> 28:01.600
AND SHE CAN HAVE MORE.

28:01.633 --> 28:03.633
SHE CAN HAVE MORE
THAN A TRAILER PARK

28:03.667 --> 28:06.333
AND A GRAVEYARD SHIFT
AT A TRUCK STOP DINER.

28:06.367 --> 28:09.367
DON'T YOU WANT THAT
FOR HER?

28:09.400 --> 28:11.200
I MEAN, IF YOU CAN
GET PAST THE FACT

28:11.233 --> 28:14.300
THAT I'M SUPERIOR
AND THAT I'M JUDGING YOU

28:14.333 --> 28:17.467
AND THAT I'M TELLING YOU
WHAT'S BEST FOR YOUR FAMILY--

28:17.500 --> 28:20.067
IF YOU CAN JUST
GET PAST ALL OF THAT--

28:20.100 --> 28:23.633
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT I'M ALSO RIGHT?

28:28.433 --> 28:30.100
(monitor beeping)

28:30.133 --> 28:32.233
PRETTY SPECTACULAR RECOVERY,
CLAIRE.

28:32.267 --> 28:34.333
REALLY?

28:34.367 --> 28:36.267
DO YOU THINK
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY?

28:36.300 --> 28:38.633
I THINK WE GOT ALMOST ALL
OF THE NECROTIC TISSUE.

28:38.667 --> 28:40.567
A FEW TIMES
IN A HYPERBARIC CHAMBER,

28:40.600 --> 28:43.067
AND I'M THINKIN'
YOU'LL BE OUT OF THE WOODS.

28:43.067 --> 28:44.600
THANK YOU
FOR SAVING MY LEG.

28:44.633 --> 28:47.533
MY PLEASURE.

28:47.567 --> 28:50.367
NOW DR. KAREV HERE WILL EXPLAIN
THE HYPERBARIC CHAMBER.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.567
DR. KAREV?

28:51.600 --> 28:53.133
THANK YOU, DR. HERON.

28:53.167 --> 28:55.100
(sighs) THE HYPERBARIC
CHAMBER...

28:55.133 --> 28:57.067
I'LL TAKE THAT APOLOGY
ANYTIME.

28:57.067 --> 28:58.800
...WHICH HELPS KILL
ALL THE BACTERIA.

28:58.833 --> 29:01.200
THIS PROCESS IS DONE
OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS.

29:05.100 --> 29:06.667
THANK YOU.

29:08.500 --> 29:11.467
SO I'M GOING TO GIVE HER
A SEDATIVE,

29:11.500 --> 29:14.167
WHICH WILL EASE
HER DISCOMFORT.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.700
AND THEN I'LL REMOVE
THE TUBE.

29:15.733 --> 29:16.667
OKAY.

29:16.700 --> 29:18.567
(woman) ARE YOU READY?

29:22.200 --> 29:23.800
YES.

29:26.067 --> 29:27.433
WAIT.

29:33.667 --> 29:36.067
GOOD-BYE, MOMMY.

29:40.300 --> 29:41.400

29:45.800 --> 29:48.333
OH, NO. NO, WE'VE ALREADY
SAID OUR GOOD-BYES.

29:48.367 --> 29:53.467
WE JUST WANTED TO BE HERE
WHEN GRACE CROSSED OVER.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.667
I'M READY.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.200
I CAN TAKE CARE OF THIS.

30:06.233 --> 30:08.333
I DID IT.
I-I SHOULD UNDO IT.

30:20.833 --> 30:24.633
HOW LONG?
I MEAN, BEFORE...

30:25.833 --> 30:29.467
IT CAN TAKE AWHILE.

I'M NOT APOLOGIZING.
YOU MADE ME CROSS A LINE.

DO ANYTHING?

I'M YOUR TEACHER.

31:07.600 --> 31:10.400

OR THREE TIMES A WEEK.

A SECRET?

YEAH.

OVERSTEPPING.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.833
I'M--I'M SORRY.

38:32.867 --> 38:36.167
WELL, THAT'S THE COMPASSION
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

39:00.733 --> 39:02.633
WELL, I SEEM TO REMEMBER
PUSHING THROUGH PAPERWORK

39:02.667 --> 39:04.567
FOR A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR
SURGERY ROBOT.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.500
THERE WAS A 2-YEAR
WAITING LIST FOR THAT.

39:06.533 --> 39:08.433
IT WILL BRING IN
HUGE BUSINESS.

39:08.467 --> 39:10.733
AND COULD YOU AND THE ROBOT
HANDLE THAT BUSINESS

39:10.767 --> 39:12.633
WITHOUT NURSES?

39:12.667 --> 39:14.167
***

39:14.200 --> 39:15.800
WE CAN'T HELP OURSELVES.

39:15.833 --> 39:19.433
WE SEE A LINE...
WE WANT TO CROSS IT.

39:19.467 --> 39:20.800
MAYBE IT'S THE THRILL

39:20.833 --> 39:23.500
OF TRADING THE FAMILIAR
FOR THE UNFAMILIAR,

39:23.533 --> 39:26.100
A SORT OF PERSONAL DARE.

39:26.133 --> 39:27.333
CONGRATULATIONS.

39:27.367 --> 39:29.767
ONLY PROBLEM IS,

39:29.800 --> 39:31.467
ONCE YOU'VE CROSSED,

39:31.500 --> 39:33.767
IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE

39:33.800 --> 39:36.167
TO GO BACK.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.067
***

39:39.100 --> 39:41.267
(video game beeps)

39:46.867 --> 39:49.567
(sighs)

39:49.600 --> 39:51.100
ARE YOU OKAY?

39:51.133 --> 39:52.167
YEAH.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.067
YOU KNOW, I AM.

39:54.100 --> 39:57.100
***

40:05.167 --> 40:07.433
YOU OKAY?

40:07.467 --> 40:09.367
YEAH.

40:09.400 --> 40:10.767
WHAT HAPPENED TODAY?

40:10.800 --> 40:11.733
NOTHING.

40:11.767 --> 40:14.400
NOTHING.

40:14.433 --> 40:17.233
OKAY.

40:17.267 --> 40:21.100
WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT EACH OTHER, GEORGE.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.600
YEAH.

40:23.633 --> 40:24.800
TRUE.

40:24.833 --> 40:26.500
BUT...

40:26.533 --> 40:30.433
IF YOU DO MANAGE TO MAKE IT
BACK ACROSS THAT LINE...

40:30.467 --> 40:33.333
YOU FIND SAFETY IN NUMBERS.

40:33.367 --> 40:35.733
(George) ANYBODY
WANT TO HAVE SEX?

40:35.767 --> 40:37.533
(Izzie) GEORGE!
(Meredith laughs)
