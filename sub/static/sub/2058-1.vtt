01:25.269 --> 01:28.062
- Everybody, heads up!
- Keep it clear, now.

01:28.146 --> 01:29.522
Keep it clear!

01:30.774 --> 01:32.441
Stand back!

01:36.697 --> 01:38.447
Bring it forward,
come on!

01:44.496 --> 01:45.788
Slow it down!

01:56.300 --> 01:58.634
Pushing team, move in there.
Move in.

01:59.845 --> 02:03.055
On your ready.
I want Tasers on full charge.

02:04.391 --> 02:07.560
- Steady!
- Go on. Step back in.

02:07.895 --> 02:09.478
Ready. Move it.

02:10.814 --> 02:12.148
And push.

02:18.822 --> 02:21.574
Locked. Loading team,
step away.

02:21.825 --> 02:22.909
Move it.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.543
Jophery, raise the gate.

02:50.354 --> 02:52.897
- Block the opening!
- Don't let her get out!

03:02.199 --> 03:03.699
Somebody help him!

03:03.951 --> 03:05.785
Work her back!

03:17.255 --> 03:18.631
Shoot her!

03:57.170 --> 03:59.171
I heard that Hammond's
not even here.

03:59.256 --> 04:00.506
He sends his apologies.

04:00.590 --> 04:03.676
There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker

04:03.760 --> 04:06.345
and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

04:06.430 --> 04:09.557
He had to leave early, his
daughter's getting a divorce.

04:09.641 --> 04:12.685
I understand, but we need to
deal with the situation now.

04:12.769 --> 04:14.937
The insurance company...
You okay?

04:17.482 --> 04:21.986
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.655
That makes the investors
very anxious.

04:24.740 --> 04:28.325
I had to promise to conduct a very
thorough, on-site inspection.

04:29.911 --> 04:32.580
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

04:32.664 --> 04:34.373
I need to or they'll
pull the funding.

04:34.458 --> 04:36.333
That'll slow him down
even more.

04:41.923 --> 04:43.257
Watch your head.

04:43.842 --> 04:47.136
If two experts sign off
on the island,

04:47.220 --> 04:48.679
the insurance guys
will back off.

04:49.181 --> 04:52.224
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

04:52.309 --> 04:53.893
They want Alan Grant.
Grant?

04:53.977 --> 04:56.228
You'll never get him
out of Montana.

04:56.938 --> 04:58.230
Why not?

05:00.150 --> 05:01.484
Why not?

05:03.820 --> 05:05.821
Because Grant's like me.

05:07.616 --> 05:09.158
He's a digger.

05:53.745 --> 05:56.622
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.500
I hate computers.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.460
The feeling's mutual.

06:16.434 --> 06:17.643
Take a look.

06:20.564 --> 06:21.772
Did it work?

06:21.857 --> 06:23.357
How long
does this take?

06:23.441 --> 06:24.942
Should bring
an immediate return.

06:25.026 --> 06:26.485
You shoot the radar
into the ground,

06:26.570 --> 06:29.113
and the bone bounces
the image back.

06:29.781 --> 06:31.282
Bounces it back...

06:33.368 --> 06:35.411
This new program
is incredible.

06:35.954 --> 06:39.456
A few more years' development, and
we won't even have to dig any more.

06:39.541 --> 06:41.250
Where's the fun in that?

06:41.835 --> 06:45.337
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.550
Post-mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments.

06:49.968 --> 06:51.218
Velociraptor?

06:51.303 --> 06:52.845
Yes. Good shape, too.

06:53.221 --> 06:56.348
It's five, six feet high.
I'm guessing nine feet long.

06:56.433 --> 06:57.766
Look...
What'd you do?

06:57.851 --> 06:59.185
He touched it.

06:59.269 --> 07:01.353
Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.

07:01.438 --> 07:03.230
Hell, they've got it
in for me.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.817
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.

07:06.902 --> 07:09.570
It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.

07:11.448 --> 07:12.781
No, seriously.

07:14.868 --> 07:19.705
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present-day birds than with reptiles.

07:19.789 --> 07:23.292
Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.

07:23.376 --> 07:27.671
Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, like a bird.

07:27.839 --> 07:30.883
And even the word "Raptor"
means "bird of prey."

07:30.967 --> 07:33.260
That doesn't
look very scary.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.556
More like a 6-foot turkey.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.393
A turkey?

07:44.314 --> 07:46.232
Imagine yourself in
the Cretaceous period.

07:46.316 --> 07:47.524
Here we go.

07:47.609 --> 07:51.779
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.074
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

07:55.158 --> 07:59.578
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,

07:59.663 --> 08:02.414
like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.

08:02.499 --> 08:04.625
But no, not Velociraptor.

08:05.168 --> 08:09.046
You stare at him and he
just stares right back.

08:09.798 --> 08:11.215
And that's when
the attack comes.

08:11.299 --> 08:14.385
Not from the front,
but from the side.

08:14.970 --> 08:18.806
From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.

08:20.141 --> 08:22.309
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

08:22.394 --> 08:25.020
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

08:25.230 --> 08:27.523
and he is out
in force today.

08:28.483 --> 08:31.026
And he slashes at you
with this,

08:31.528 --> 08:35.614
a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.

08:35.823 --> 08:39.743
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.953
He slashes at you

08:42.539 --> 08:44.623
here or here...

08:44.916 --> 08:46.083
Alan.

08:46.626 --> 08:50.421
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

08:51.673 --> 08:56.677
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

08:58.263 --> 09:01.682
So, you know, try to
show a little respect.

09:02.434 --> 09:03.600
Okay.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.610
Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

09:13.695 --> 09:15.779
you could've pulled
a gun on him.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.365
Yeah, I know. Kids.

09:19.200 --> 09:21.201
You want to have
one of those?

09:21.369 --> 09:22.995
I don't want that kid,

09:23.079 --> 09:26.248
but a breed of the child
could be intriguing.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.001
I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?

09:29.085 --> 09:33.505
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

09:33.590 --> 09:35.090
Cheap, cheap.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.592
They smell.

09:36.676 --> 09:38.344
They don't smell!
Some smell.

09:38.428 --> 09:40.721
Give me a break!
Babies smell.

09:48.313 --> 09:50.356
Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!

09:50.440 --> 09:51.690
Tell them to shut down!

09:51.775 --> 09:53.025
Cut the machine!

09:53.360 --> 09:55.694
- Cover it all up.
- Pull it over.

09:57.530 --> 10:01.116
Just cut it, will you?
Shut it down!

10:01.785 --> 10:02.951
What?

10:17.550 --> 10:20.761
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.971
We were saving that.

10:23.848 --> 10:25.974
For today, I guarantee it.

10:27.602 --> 10:29.395
Who in God's name
do you think you are?

10:29.479 --> 10:30.562
John Hammond.

10:30.647 --> 10:34.024
And I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.

10:35.235 --> 10:40.072
So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.

10:40.782 --> 10:41.990
Who's the jerk?

10:42.075 --> 10:44.201
This is our paleobotanist,
Dr...

10:44.285 --> 10:45.494
Sattler.

10:45.787 --> 10:47.871
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.333
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance, Dr.
Sattler, but...

10:51.418 --> 10:53.419
Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.

10:53.503 --> 10:56.922
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.759
Let me have this.
I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

11:00.844 --> 11:02.386
There's samples
all over here.

11:02.470 --> 11:04.096
I know my way
around the kitchen.

11:04.180 --> 11:06.348
Now, I'll get right
to the point.

11:07.934 --> 11:10.269
I like you.
Both of you.

11:10.687 --> 11:13.939
I can tell instantly
about people. It's a gift.

11:17.193 --> 11:20.195
I own an island off the
coast of Costa Rica.

11:20.864 --> 11:24.283
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years,

11:24.367 --> 11:26.869
I've been setting up
a biological preserve.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.329
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

11:29.414 --> 11:32.875
Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.

11:32.959 --> 11:37.129
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.714
And what are those?

11:38.798 --> 11:40.591
Small versions of
adults, honey.

11:40.675 --> 11:42.593
And not just kids, everyone.

11:42.677 --> 11:46.013
We're going to open next year, if
the lawyers don't kill me first.

11:46.097 --> 11:48.599
I don't care for lawyers,
do you?

11:49.184 --> 11:52.019
I don't really know any.
Don't really know any.

11:52.353 --> 11:57.191
I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.

11:57.442 --> 12:00.277
Says that they insist
on outside opinions.

12:00.361 --> 12:01.987
What kind of opinions?

12:02.113 --> 12:05.115
Well, your kind, not to put
too fine a point on it.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.286
Let's face it, in your particular
fields, you're the top minds.

12:09.621 --> 12:11.830
And if I could just
persuade you

12:12.290 --> 12:15.459
to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,

12:15.543 --> 12:19.963
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

12:21.549 --> 12:23.509
Why would they care
what we think?

12:23.593 --> 12:25.177
What kind of park
is this?

12:27.722 --> 12:29.431
It's right up your alley.

12:32.268 --> 12:35.521
Why don't you come down, just the
pair of you, for the weekend?

12:35.605 --> 12:38.774
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

12:39.275 --> 12:41.777
I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.

12:43.738 --> 12:46.073
I'm sorry.
This isn't possible.

12:46.908 --> 12:48.534
We just dug up
a new skeleton...

12:48.618 --> 12:52.704
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

12:53.081 --> 12:55.791
This is a very unusual time.
The timing is...

12:55.917 --> 12:58.252
for a further
three years.

13:03.258 --> 13:04.716
Where's the plane?

13:06.094 --> 13:07.219
Okay.
Three years.

13:07.303 --> 13:08.595
Cheers.

13:50.847 --> 13:52.139
Dodgson!

14:00.315 --> 14:02.107
You shouldn't use my name.

14:03.109 --> 14:05.944
Dodgson. We've got
Dodgson here.

14:07.030 --> 14:09.781
See, nobody cares.
Nice hat.

14:10.366 --> 14:13.201
What're you trying to look
like, a secret agent?

14:13.536 --> 14:15.037
Well?
$750,000.

14:15.622 --> 14:18.040
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

14:18.166 --> 14:21.209
That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.

14:21.294 --> 14:22.377
I'll get them all.

14:22.503 --> 14:26.381
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

14:26.507 --> 14:28.717
How am I supposed
to transport them?

14:32.513 --> 14:34.222
The bottom screws open.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.559
That's great.
Oh, my God.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.145
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

14:40.229 --> 14:41.772
You guys.
That's great.

14:41.856 --> 14:43.482
Customs can even check it
if they want to.

14:43.566 --> 14:45.067
Let me see.
Go on.

14:46.069 --> 14:47.778
There's enough coolant
for 36 hours.

14:47.862 --> 14:49.029
No menthol?

14:49.238 --> 14:52.157
The embryos have to be back
here in San José by then.

14:52.241 --> 14:53.992
That's up to your guy
on the boat.

14:54.077 --> 14:57.746
7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

14:58.081 --> 14:59.831
How are you planning
to beat security?

14:59.916 --> 15:02.042
I've got
an 18-minute window.

15:02.210 --> 15:06.088
Eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

15:10.218 --> 15:12.219
Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.

15:14.764 --> 15:16.765
That was Hammond's mistake.

15:30.446 --> 15:33.448
So you two
dig up dinosaurs?

15:35.952 --> 15:37.869
Well...
We try to.

15:44.085 --> 15:46.795
You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.

15:46.921 --> 15:49.715
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

15:49.799 --> 15:51.299
especially for
a mathematician.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.260
Chaotician. Chaotician,
actually.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.137
John doesn't subscribe
to chaos,

15:55.221 --> 15:57.723
particularly what it says
about his science project.

15:57.807 --> 16:01.518
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

16:01.602 --> 16:04.479
Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?

16:04.564 --> 16:07.816
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...

16:08.067 --> 16:09.151
Don't.

16:09.277 --> 16:12.320
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

16:12.613 --> 16:13.613
No.

16:13.698 --> 16:14.990
No? Non-linear equations?

16:16.325 --> 16:17.826
Strange attractors?

16:19.954 --> 16:24.583
I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.

16:28.671 --> 16:31.965
I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.512
There it is.

17:05.374 --> 17:07.584
Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.127
Hold on, this will
be thrilling.

17:37.907 --> 17:40.575
But you need that piece over
here, and that piece...

17:40.701 --> 17:43.411
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

17:44.413 --> 17:45.622
Great.

19:03.951 --> 19:06.578
The full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place?

19:06.662 --> 19:09.873
And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.

19:09.999 --> 19:13.168
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

19:13.461 --> 19:16.338
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

19:16.464 --> 19:19.507
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

19:19.634 --> 19:22.469
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

19:22.553 --> 19:26.056
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

19:26.182 --> 19:27.891
I'll shut you down, John.

19:28.517 --> 19:32.520
In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.

19:42.031 --> 19:44.324
All right, slow down.
Slow. Stop!

19:46.535 --> 19:48.203
This shouldn't be here.

20:08.057 --> 20:10.850
Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct

20:10.935 --> 20:13.687
since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

20:13.771 --> 20:15.105
What?

20:44.760 --> 20:46.052
Look at that.

20:49.432 --> 20:51.433
It's a dinosaur.

20:55.771 --> 20:59.107
You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.

21:00.443 --> 21:04.112
We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.531
They're wrong. This is
a warm-blooded creature.

21:06.615 --> 21:08.116
This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.326
This thing's got
a 25, 27-foot neck?

21:10.411 --> 21:11.828
The Brachiosaurus? 30.

21:11.912 --> 21:12.954
Thirty feet.

21:29.513 --> 21:32.140
We're gonna make
a fortune with this place.

21:36.979 --> 21:38.480
How fast are they?

21:38.606 --> 21:41.816
Well, we clocked the T-Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

21:43.652 --> 21:45.028
T-Rex?

21:46.155 --> 21:48.114
You said you've got a T-Rex?

21:49.158 --> 21:50.283
Say again.

21:51.452 --> 21:52.827
We have a T-Rex.

21:54.705 --> 21:56.873
Put your head
between your knees.

21:57.333 --> 21:58.541
Dr. Grant,

21:59.001 --> 22:00.960
my dear Dr. Sattler,

22:01.337 --> 22:04.547
welcome to Jurassic Park.

22:28.197 --> 22:29.948
They're moving in herds.

22:32.201 --> 22:33.785
They do move in herds.

22:41.877 --> 22:43.461
How did you do this?

22:46.257 --> 22:47.590
I'll show you.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.741
Good day.

23:14.410 --> 23:17.162
The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

23:18.873 --> 23:21.040
incorporating all
the latest technologies.

23:21.125 --> 23:24.419
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

23:24.503 --> 23:28.756
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding

23:28.924 --> 23:32.427
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

23:32.803 --> 23:34.596
So, what are you thinking?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.182
That we're out of a job.

23:37.266 --> 23:38.933
Don't you mean "extinct"?

23:46.859 --> 23:50.862
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

23:51.780 --> 23:54.824
Here he comes.
Well, here I come.

23:59.496 --> 24:00.705
Hello.

24:01.498 --> 24:02.874
Say hello.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.125
Hello.

24:05.294 --> 24:06.461
Hello, John.

24:07.129 --> 24:08.922
Yes, I've got lines.

24:09.006 --> 24:12.467
Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?

24:13.969 --> 24:17.472
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

24:18.182 --> 24:19.307
Your blood.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.642
Right.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.478
That hurt.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.981
Relax, John. It's all part
of the miracle of cloning.

24:27.191 --> 24:29.150
Hello, John.

24:31.153 --> 24:32.403
Cloned from what?

24:32.488 --> 24:35.198
Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.

24:35.324 --> 24:37.367
Not without massive
sequence gaps.

24:37.493 --> 24:39.369
Paleo-DNA,
from what source?

24:40.037 --> 24:43.498
Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?

24:48.170 --> 24:49.504
What? What?

24:50.256 --> 24:53.216
Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?

24:53.384 --> 24:54.676
From your blood.

24:54.760 --> 24:59.055
Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,

24:59.390 --> 25:01.683
the building blocks of life.

25:02.393 --> 25:07.063
A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.

25:07.439 --> 25:12.402
And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,

25:12.778 --> 25:17.740
left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.

25:17.908 --> 25:22.745
A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.

25:22.871 --> 25:26.207
And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.

25:26.458 --> 25:31.045
Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,

25:31.380 --> 25:35.883
mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.

25:36.218 --> 25:41.097
After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,

25:41.223 --> 25:46.102
just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.

25:46.812 --> 25:50.398
This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber,

25:50.733 --> 25:54.986
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside

25:55.154 --> 25:58.156
until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.

25:59.074 --> 26:01.200
Using sophisticated
techniques,

26:01.285 --> 26:03.369
they extract
the preserved blood

26:03.454 --> 26:07.790
from the mosquito,
Dino DNA!

26:08.834 --> 26:13.129
A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

26:13.756 --> 26:17.842
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,

26:17.926 --> 26:22.096
it'd take two years to look
at the entire DNA strand.

26:22.181 --> 26:26.851
It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.

26:27.478 --> 26:30.146
Now that's where our
geneticists take over.

26:30.689 --> 26:34.317
Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers

26:34.401 --> 26:36.569
break down the strand
in minutes.

26:36.653 --> 26:38.696
And virtual-reality displays

26:38.781 --> 26:41.949
show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.

26:42.534 --> 26:45.036
We used the complete
DNA of a frog

26:45.120 --> 26:49.040
to fill in the holes
and complete the code.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.795
Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.

26:56.965 --> 26:58.883
This score
is only temporary.

26:58.967 --> 27:01.010
It all has very dramatic
music, of course.

27:01.637 --> 27:04.180
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

27:04.306 --> 27:06.182
And then, the tour moves on.

27:15.651 --> 27:20.446
- Well, look here.
- Those hard-working cowpokes you see behind us...

27:20.531 --> 27:22.907
This is overwhelming, John.

27:23.075 --> 27:27.245
Are these characters
autoerotica?

27:27.329 --> 27:29.997
No, we have no
animatronics here.

27:30.124 --> 27:33.459
Those people are the real miracle
workers of Jurassic Park.

27:33.544 --> 27:36.754
In unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs.

27:37.548 --> 27:40.508
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

27:40.592 --> 27:42.093
Can't we see
the unfertilized eggs?

27:42.177 --> 27:43.302
Shortly.

27:44.430 --> 27:48.349
Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...

27:48.434 --> 27:49.642
Can't you stop
these things?

27:49.726 --> 27:51.811
I'm sorry.
It's kind of a ride.

27:51.895 --> 27:53.855
One, two, three.

27:55.566 --> 27:57.650
- You can't do that.
- What?

27:57.734 --> 27:59.193
Can they do that?

28:01.780 --> 28:03.906
The boat
for the mainland

28:03.991 --> 28:06.117
will be leaving at 1900.

28:06.201 --> 28:11.122
All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.

28:11.915 --> 28:13.624
Good day, Henry.

28:13.709 --> 28:15.042
Good day, sir.

28:29.099 --> 28:30.683
It's turning the eggs.

28:34.396 --> 28:38.399
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

28:38.484 --> 28:40.943
Henry, why
didn't you tell me?

28:41.153 --> 28:45.072
I insist on being here
when they're born.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.201
Come on.

28:49.745 --> 28:51.412
Come on, little one.

28:57.753 --> 28:59.128
Come on, then.

29:02.466 --> 29:04.300
Very good. Push.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.429
- Very good.
- God.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.932
Push. Come on.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.435
Come on. Come on, then.

29:14.728 --> 29:17.563
There you are.

29:22.611 --> 29:25.988
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

29:26.073 --> 29:28.991
That's it.
Helps them to trust me.

29:29.785 --> 29:34.622
I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.918
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?

29:39.086 --> 29:41.337
Actually they can't
breed in the wild.

29:41.421 --> 29:44.257
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

29:44.341 --> 29:47.301
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.721
How do you know
they can't breed?

29:51.932 --> 29:55.309
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

29:55.394 --> 29:57.770
We've engineered them
that way.

29:57.938 --> 29:59.480
There you are.

30:01.775 --> 30:04.527
- Oh, my God.
- Look at that.

30:04.945 --> 30:08.239
Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.

30:08.323 --> 30:09.448
Wu?

30:09.533 --> 30:10.825
Ninety-one.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.035
Homoeothermic?
It holds that temperature?

30:13.120 --> 30:14.203
Yes.

30:18.959 --> 30:21.711
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

30:21.795 --> 30:25.881
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

30:25.966 --> 30:29.427
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

30:29.511 --> 30:32.096
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.

30:32.180 --> 30:35.850
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage

30:35.934 --> 30:37.059
to make them male.

30:37.144 --> 30:38.603
We simply deny them that.

30:38.687 --> 30:40.021
Deny them that?

30:40.188 --> 30:43.816
John, the kind of control you're
attempting is not possible.

30:43.900 --> 30:46.861
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

30:46.945 --> 30:48.654
it's that life will
not be contained.

30:48.739 --> 30:51.407
Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories

30:51.491 --> 30:55.077
and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

30:55.162 --> 30:57.872
but there it is.

30:59.416 --> 31:00.875
There it is.

31:01.460 --> 31:06.380
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

31:06.465 --> 31:10.885
No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.

31:18.060 --> 31:19.977
What species is this?

31:22.022 --> 31:23.648
It's a Velociraptor.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.320
You bred Raptors?

31:43.627 --> 31:48.214
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.384
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
What are they doing?

31:57.140 --> 31:58.349
Feeding them.

32:03.522 --> 32:08.359
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu for us.
Chilean sea bass, I believe.

32:09.569 --> 32:10.903
Shall we?

32:50.652 --> 32:52.903
They should all be destroyed.

32:52.988 --> 32:55.990
Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.

32:56.116 --> 32:59.076
Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.

32:59.161 --> 33:01.078
What's their growth rate?

33:01.163 --> 33:03.789
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

33:03.874 --> 33:07.376
I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...

33:07.461 --> 33:09.462
Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.

33:10.046 --> 33:12.590
Fifty, sixty miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open.

33:12.674 --> 33:14.425
And they're
astonishing jumpers.

33:14.509 --> 33:17.803
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.599
Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...

33:21.683 --> 33:23.392
They show extreme
intelligence.

33:23.477 --> 33:25.936
Even problem-solving
intelligence.

33:26.021 --> 33:27.605
Especially the big one.

33:27.689 --> 33:30.107
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in,

33:30.192 --> 33:33.611
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.

33:33.862 --> 33:39.325
That one, when she looks at you, you
can see she's working things out.

33:40.660 --> 33:42.870
That's why we have to
feed them like this.

33:42.996 --> 33:45.956
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

33:46.041 --> 33:47.875
The fences are electrified,
right?

33:47.959 --> 33:51.128
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

33:51.213 --> 33:54.882
They were testing the fences for
weaknesses, systematically.

33:56.343 --> 33:57.843
They remember.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.899
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

34:12.359 --> 34:14.275
More adventurous guests,
of course,

34:14.360 --> 34:15.985
can opt for our
jungle river cruise

34:16.071 --> 34:18.489
or for a close-up look
at our majestic...

34:18.572 --> 34:21.826
None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open

34:21.909 --> 34:26.246
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line

34:26.373 --> 34:27.706
six or twelve months
after that.

34:27.791 --> 34:30.000
Absolutely spectacular
designs.

34:30.085 --> 34:31.293
Spared no expense.

34:31.378 --> 34:33.337
And we can charge
anything we want.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.172
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

34:36.257 --> 34:37.925
And there's
the merchandise...

34:38.009 --> 34:39.092
Donald.

34:39.594 --> 34:42.847
This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.

34:42.931 --> 34:45.933
Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.

34:46.059 --> 34:50.603
Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.

34:55.527 --> 35:00.406
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

35:01.199 --> 35:04.869
Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.

35:04.953 --> 35:06.370
I know.
They're a lot worse.

35:06.454 --> 35:09.707
Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...

35:10.417 --> 35:14.712
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

35:14.796 --> 35:20.050
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

35:20.135 --> 35:22.720
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen

35:22.804 --> 35:25.639
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

35:25.765 --> 35:27.892
It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...

35:27.976 --> 35:29.268
If I may.

35:29.436 --> 35:33.063
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

35:33.148 --> 35:36.150
It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

35:37.319 --> 35:40.779
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

35:40.864 --> 35:43.198
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

35:43.283 --> 35:46.327
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

35:46.661 --> 35:49.580
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

35:49.664 --> 35:50.831
something as fast
as you could.

35:50.957 --> 35:55.252
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it

35:55.337 --> 35:58.422
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.

35:58.506 --> 36:00.257
You're going to sell it.

36:00.550 --> 36:03.010
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

36:03.094 --> 36:06.513
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.850
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

36:09.935 --> 36:12.186
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

36:12.270 --> 36:16.190
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

36:16.900 --> 36:20.152
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

36:20.236 --> 36:21.779
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

36:21.863 --> 36:24.615
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

36:24.699 --> 36:27.868
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

36:27.994 --> 36:32.831
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.

36:34.834 --> 36:39.046
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

36:39.172 --> 36:44.051
How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?

36:44.177 --> 36:45.594
What's so great
about discovery?

36:45.679 --> 36:47.805
It's a violent,
penetrative act,

36:47.889 --> 36:51.517
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

36:52.560 --> 36:55.312
I call the rape of
the natural world.

36:56.189 --> 36:59.984
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

37:00.068 --> 37:03.237
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

37:03.363 --> 37:06.323
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

37:06.408 --> 37:07.866
You picked them
because they look good.

37:07.951 --> 37:12.037
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

37:12.122 --> 37:15.290
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

37:17.627 --> 37:20.504
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here

37:20.588 --> 37:22.464
who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...

37:24.426 --> 37:29.138
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

37:29.889 --> 37:34.435
I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

37:34.561 --> 37:38.689
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution

37:38.773 --> 37:42.234
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

37:42.318 --> 37:46.739
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?

37:47.824 --> 37:50.034
I don't believe it.

37:50.118 --> 37:53.412
You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters

37:53.496 --> 37:57.166
and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

37:57.792 --> 37:58.959
Thank you.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.134
They're here.

38:08.136 --> 38:10.929
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

38:11.014 --> 38:13.807
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

38:13.933 --> 38:16.477
- Grandpa!
- Kids!

38:19.481 --> 38:21.148
Wait! Careful with me.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.232
We missed you.

38:22.317 --> 38:23.484
Me, too.

38:23.610 --> 38:26.070
We loved the presents.
They were great.

38:26.154 --> 38:27.279
Did you enjoy
the helicopter?

38:27.363 --> 38:30.032
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

38:33.328 --> 38:36.497
- Now, kids, come away.
- Not too close to the cars.

38:37.999 --> 38:41.043
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though?

38:41.169 --> 38:43.629
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

38:43.713 --> 38:44.755
No drivers?

38:44.839 --> 38:46.757
No. No drivers.
They're electric.

38:46.841 --> 38:49.593
They run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here.

38:49.677 --> 38:52.763
Totally non-polluting.
Top of the line. Spared no expense.

38:52.847 --> 38:54.598
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

38:54.682 --> 38:58.519
You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

38:58.645 --> 39:01.688
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

39:01.815 --> 39:03.690
Dr. Grant, come in
the second car.

39:03.817 --> 39:06.360
I'm gonna ride
with Dr. Sattler.

39:17.914 --> 39:19.581
I read your book.

39:21.167 --> 39:22.376
That's great.

39:23.378 --> 39:27.548
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

39:28.508 --> 39:31.385
A few species may have
evolved along those lines.

39:36.391 --> 39:39.226
Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.

39:40.061 --> 39:42.896
I heard that there
was this meteor,

39:43.064 --> 39:47.276
hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.

39:47.402 --> 39:49.319
Listen...

39:49.404 --> 39:50.529
Tim.

39:51.114 --> 39:53.782
Tim, which car
were you planning on?

39:55.577 --> 39:57.369
Whichever one you are.

39:59.998 --> 40:04.960
Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

40:05.211 --> 40:07.880
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

40:07.964 --> 40:09.506
They died because
of the weather.

40:09.591 --> 40:13.927
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

40:15.763 --> 40:19.224
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

40:19.601 --> 40:21.310
The boat is now loading.

40:21.436 --> 40:26.106
Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.

40:27.483 --> 40:30.444
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm

40:30.570 --> 40:32.821
about 75 miles west of us.

40:33.615 --> 40:35.407
Why didn't I build
in Orlando?

40:35.491 --> 40:39.286
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

40:43.625 --> 40:45.584
Ray, start the tour program.

40:55.136 --> 40:56.970
Hold onto your butts.

41:06.648 --> 41:09.274
And why did they put
the fiberglass thing?

41:10.610 --> 41:11.652
I know.

41:20.161 --> 41:22.329
You want to
join the future, right?

41:22.538 --> 41:24.831
God help us when
the hands of engineers...

41:24.958 --> 41:26.250
During your tour,

41:26.334 --> 41:27.793
the appropriate
information will be

41:27.877 --> 41:30.170
automatically selected
and displayed for you.

41:30.296 --> 41:31.296
Look!

41:31.381 --> 41:34.341
Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.676
Are we gonna hit that?

41:35.760 --> 41:37.844
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

41:41.975 --> 41:44.351
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

41:57.949 --> 42:00.617
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

42:01.035 --> 42:02.286
We spared no expense.

42:02.370 --> 42:03.704
If you look to the right,

42:03.788 --> 42:08.709
you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

42:09.669 --> 42:10.794
Dilophosaurus!

42:10.878 --> 42:11.962
Shit!

42:12.046 --> 42:13.880
One of the earliest
carnivores,

42:13.965 --> 42:17.301
we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous

42:17.385 --> 42:22.389
spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,

42:22.473 --> 42:25.559
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.

42:26.227 --> 42:29.896
This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition

42:30.064 --> 42:31.898
to Jurassic Park.

42:39.073 --> 42:40.574
Alan?

42:41.659 --> 42:42.826
Where?

42:46.706 --> 42:47.873
Damn.

42:52.545 --> 42:54.838
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

42:54.922 --> 42:57.424
Those shouldn't be running
off of car batteries.

42:57.550 --> 43:00.093
Item 151 on
today's glitch list.

43:00.219 --> 43:03.347
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo

43:03.431 --> 43:06.433
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

43:08.353 --> 43:12.105
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?

43:13.900 --> 43:16.276
I am totally unappreciated
in my time.

43:16.402 --> 43:20.197
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

43:20.281 --> 43:24.284
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

43:24.619 --> 43:27.162
You know anybody who can
network eight machines

43:27.246 --> 43:31.041
and de-bug two million lines of code on my salary?
If so, I want to see them.

43:31.125 --> 43:35.545
Sorry about your financial problems, I really am.
But they are your problems.

43:35.630 --> 43:38.465
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

43:38.549 --> 43:42.803
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.

43:42.887 --> 43:44.054
I really will not.

43:44.138 --> 43:46.181
There's been hardly
any debate at all.

43:46.265 --> 43:49.142
I don't blame people
for their mistakes.

43:49.769 --> 43:51.978
But I do ask that
they pay for them.

43:52.230 --> 43:53.438
Thanks, Dad.

43:54.565 --> 43:55.732
The headlights.

43:55.817 --> 43:58.402
I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

43:58.486 --> 44:00.737
It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.

44:00.822 --> 44:01.863
We'll lose part
of the system.

44:01.948 --> 44:05.075
There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

44:05.159 --> 44:07.244
Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...

44:07.328 --> 44:08.787
Quiet, all of you!

44:09.789 --> 44:12.165
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

45:03.176 --> 45:06.720
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

45:07.180 --> 45:11.975
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

45:13.060 --> 45:16.730
Dinosaurs eat man.

45:18.191 --> 45:20.233
Woman inherits the earth.

45:27.867 --> 45:31.077
- We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
- Keep watching the fence.

45:41.214 --> 45:43.423
What's going to happen
to the goat?

45:47.428 --> 45:49.262
He's going to eat the goat?

45:49.430 --> 45:50.847
Excellent.

45:51.933 --> 45:55.185
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

45:55.770 --> 45:58.063
I happen to be a vegetarian.

46:06.405 --> 46:09.616
T-Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

46:10.535 --> 46:15.288
You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

46:37.228 --> 46:42.148
Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?

46:45.820 --> 46:48.154
Hello. Yes?

46:48.739 --> 46:50.740
I really hate that man.

46:55.955 --> 47:00.750
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any
set patterns or park schedules.

47:00.835 --> 47:03.003
The essence of chaos.

47:04.171 --> 47:06.172
I'm still not
clear on chaos.

47:07.842 --> 47:11.761
It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.

47:13.306 --> 47:15.265
The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.

47:15.349 --> 47:17.601
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking

47:17.685 --> 47:20.770
and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.

47:22.982 --> 47:24.858
Was I going too fast?
I missed it.

47:24.984 --> 47:26.109
I did a fly-by.

47:26.193 --> 47:28.945
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

47:29.030 --> 47:30.780
We should be still.
The car's bouncing.

47:30.865 --> 47:32.699
That's okay.
It's just an example.

47:32.825 --> 47:35.201
Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

47:35.786 --> 47:37.704
A drop of water falls
on your hand.

47:37.788 --> 47:40.540
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

47:40.833 --> 47:42.292
Thumb, I'd say.

47:45.004 --> 47:47.047
Freeze your hand.
Don't move.

47:47.131 --> 47:50.050
I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.

47:50.134 --> 47:51.551
Which way, now?

47:51.677 --> 47:54.638
Let's say back
the same way.

47:57.016 --> 47:59.392
It changed. Why?

47:59.560 --> 48:01.853
Because tiny variations,

48:02.396 --> 48:04.814
the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

48:04.899 --> 48:06.232
Alan, look at this.

48:06.317 --> 48:09.986
The amount of blood distending your
vessels, imperfections in the skin...

48:10.071 --> 48:11.613
"imperfections in the skin"?

48:11.697 --> 48:12.989
Just microscopic,

48:13.074 --> 48:15.992
never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome.

48:16.077 --> 48:17.202
That's what?

48:17.286 --> 48:18.411
Unpredictability.

48:21.248 --> 48:24.417
There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.

48:24.502 --> 48:28.922
Nobody could predict that Dr.
Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

48:31.092 --> 48:33.510
And there's another example.

48:35.012 --> 48:39.432
See, here I am now by myself, talking to myself.
That's Chaos Theory.

48:40.851 --> 48:43.770
Stop the program.

48:45.856 --> 48:50.151
I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

48:50.236 --> 48:52.862
Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.

48:52.947 --> 48:55.240
We're on.
Will notify for resume.

48:57.618 --> 48:59.703
I'll switch it
over to TelePrompTer.

48:59.787 --> 49:01.287
What about
the circuit integrities?

49:01.372 --> 49:03.456
Screen says faulty sensor.

49:05.793 --> 49:06.876
I'll call security.

49:06.961 --> 49:09.295
We're at full go
on that and it looks good.

49:09.588 --> 49:13.091
Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker

49:13.175 --> 49:15.427
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.

49:15.511 --> 49:16.720
Where are we going?

49:16.804 --> 49:18.513
He didn't say
they turned into birds.

49:18.597 --> 49:20.807
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

49:20.891 --> 49:24.060
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

49:24.145 --> 49:26.896
Really?
Yours was fully illustrated.

49:27.940 --> 49:29.274
You okay?

49:29.400 --> 49:31.776
Look at this.
Wait. Watch.

49:32.486 --> 49:34.320
Come on. Watch this.

49:36.365 --> 49:37.866
Whoa.

49:40.077 --> 49:41.619
Everybody stay here.

49:56.844 --> 49:58.011
Wow.

49:59.847 --> 50:00.847
Okay?

50:00.931 --> 50:02.015
Of course.

50:05.060 --> 50:06.936
- Don't be scared.
- Come on, it's okay.

50:07.021 --> 50:08.772
Muldoon tranquillized her
for me.

50:08.856 --> 50:10.190
She's sick.

50:19.033 --> 50:20.492
Oh, my God.

50:36.008 --> 50:37.550
Hey, baby.

50:43.057 --> 50:45.558
She was always my favorite
when I was a kid

50:45.643 --> 50:49.020
and now I see she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

50:53.359 --> 50:54.734
It's okay.

50:57.863 --> 51:00.406
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

51:02.409 --> 51:04.744
Thanks.
What are her symptoms?

51:05.329 --> 51:08.081
Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.

51:08.249 --> 51:10.416
It seems to happen
every six weeks or so.

51:10.501 --> 51:11.876
Six weeks.

51:25.516 --> 51:27.100
These are dilated.
They are?

51:27.226 --> 51:28.977
Take a look.

51:29.061 --> 51:30.186
I'll be damned.

51:30.688 --> 51:34.440
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

51:41.866 --> 51:43.992
Is this West Indian lilac?

51:44.451 --> 51:47.996
Yes. We know they're toxic, but
the animals don't eat them.

51:52.418 --> 51:54.127
Are you sure?

51:54.211 --> 51:55.253
Pretty sure.

51:56.755 --> 51:59.007
There's only one way
to be positive.

51:59.675 --> 52:02.218
I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.

52:03.387 --> 52:06.514
Dino droppings?
Droppings?

52:12.313 --> 52:14.564
Yeah, I got that.

52:15.774 --> 52:18.902
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

52:19.028 --> 52:21.487
We're gonna have to
cut the tour short.

52:21.572 --> 52:23.364
We'll pick it up
again tomorrow.

52:23.449 --> 52:24.741
Are you sure we have to?

52:24.825 --> 52:26.701
It's not worth
taking the chance.

52:26.785 --> 52:28.036
Sustained winds at 45 knots.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.413
Tell them when they get
back in the cars.

52:30.497 --> 52:35.168
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

52:35.252 --> 52:37.587
Drop what you're doing
and leave now.

52:39.715 --> 52:41.007
Damn!

52:48.682 --> 52:50.600
That is one
big pile of shit.

52:57.942 --> 53:00.568
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

53:00.653 --> 53:02.695
That's so odd, though.

53:03.155 --> 53:06.783
All right, she's suffering
from Melia toxicity

53:08.494 --> 53:10.787
every six weeks.

53:12.414 --> 53:15.959
Let's see, rats.

53:16.919 --> 53:20.088
She's tenacious.

53:21.006 --> 53:22.715
You have no idea.

53:24.927 --> 53:28.680
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

53:40.943 --> 53:44.862
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

53:47.282 --> 53:50.868
I'd like to stay with Dr.
Harding and finish up with the Trike.

53:51.620 --> 53:53.413
Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.

53:53.497 --> 53:56.249
I'll drop her off at the
center before I make the boat.

53:56.333 --> 53:59.043
Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.

53:59.128 --> 54:00.253
You sure?

54:00.337 --> 54:03.089
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

54:03.173 --> 54:04.590
Okay, then.

54:19.398 --> 54:23.693
There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we got to go, we got to go.

54:23.777 --> 54:25.486
You've got to
give me the time.

54:25.571 --> 54:29.032
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18

54:29.116 --> 54:31.451
but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

54:31.535 --> 54:32.869
No promises.

54:40.627 --> 54:43.337
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

54:45.716 --> 54:50.553
So much for our first tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

54:51.972 --> 54:53.681
It could've been worse.

54:54.892 --> 54:56.142
A lot worse.

54:56.310 --> 55:00.396
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

55:00.481 --> 55:02.648
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

55:02.733 --> 55:06.486
I've had only sweets and I'm
gonna get something salty.

55:07.321 --> 55:09.739
I finished
debugging the phones.

55:10.824 --> 55:12.909
I was going to, so I did.

55:13.160 --> 55:16.162
So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe

55:16.288 --> 55:18.998
I should tell you the system
will be compiling

55:19.124 --> 55:22.001
for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems,

55:22.086 --> 55:26.005
they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

55:48.195 --> 55:49.612
Do you got any kids?

55:49.696 --> 55:52.615
Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.

55:54.409 --> 55:56.786
Anything at all can
and does happen.

55:57.287 --> 55:59.789
Same with wives,
for that matter.

56:00.207 --> 56:01.415
You're married?

56:01.500 --> 56:02.667
Occasionally.

56:04.711 --> 56:09.090
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

56:22.646 --> 56:25.898
Five, four, three,

56:27.860 --> 56:28.901
two, one.

56:37.244 --> 56:39.495
- That's odd.
- What?

56:39.746 --> 56:42.165
Door security systems
are shutting down.

56:42.249 --> 56:45.501
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

57:41.642 --> 57:43.768
By the way, Dr. Sattler,

57:44.645 --> 57:46.896
she's not available,
is she?

57:46.980 --> 57:48.064
Why?

57:50.984 --> 57:53.110
I'm sorry. You two are...

57:53.195 --> 57:54.237
Yeah.

57:57.157 --> 57:58.574
What'd I touch?

57:58.659 --> 58:00.910
You didn't touch anything.
We stopped.

58:10.003 --> 58:11.504
What the hell?

58:11.588 --> 58:12.588
What now?

58:12.673 --> 58:14.590
Fences are failing
all over the park.

58:15.008 --> 58:17.176
Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.

58:49.376 --> 58:51.127
Just look at this
work station.

58:51.211 --> 58:52.461
What a complete slob.

58:52.546 --> 58:54.839
The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

59:01.722 --> 59:03.514
No, no. They're still on.

59:06.143 --> 59:08.686
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

59:48.769 --> 59:50.436
Access main program.

59:51.271 --> 59:52.938
Access main security.

59:53.690 --> 59:55.775
Access main program grid.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.619
You didn't say
the magic word.

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:10.581
Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:14.126
Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.922
Phones are out, too.

01:00:21.468 --> 01:00:23.386
Where did the vehicles stop?

01:00:44.282 --> 01:00:45.991
Their radio's out, too.

01:00:46.326 --> 01:00:48.661
Gennaro said to stay put.
Kids okay?

01:00:48.745 --> 01:00:50.871
I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?

01:00:50.997 --> 01:00:52.665
Kids get scared.
What's scary?

01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:55.918
It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I'm not scared.

01:00:56.002 --> 01:00:56.961
I didn't say
you were scared.

01:00:57.045 --> 01:00:58.337
I know.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:00.423
Boo!

01:01:01.675 --> 01:01:04.009
Hey, where did
you find those?

01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:05.469
In the box, under my seat.

01:01:05.554 --> 01:01:06.846
Are they heavy?

01:01:07.055 --> 01:01:09.723
Yeah. Then they're expensive.
Put them back.

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.524
Don't scare me.

01:01:30.078 --> 01:01:31.871
Cool. Night vision.

01:01:57.355 --> 01:01:58.772
Did you feel that?

01:02:32.766 --> 01:02:35.392
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

01:02:37.979 --> 01:02:39.271
What is that?

01:02:56.206 --> 01:02:57.581
Where's the goat?

01:03:20.855 --> 01:03:22.106
Jesus!

01:03:26.778 --> 01:03:28.571
He left us.

01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:42.585
Where does he think
he's going?

01:03:42.669 --> 01:03:44.378
When you got to go,
you got to go.

01:04:02.522 --> 01:04:03.814
Dr. Grant.

01:04:16.703 --> 01:04:18.829
I hate being
right all the time.

01:04:27.881 --> 01:04:32.051
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

01:04:46.441 --> 01:04:48.025
Turn the light off.

01:04:52.906 --> 01:04:54.406
Turn the light off!

01:05:50.255 --> 01:05:51.714
Hurry! Turn it off!

01:05:51.798 --> 01:05:53.132
I'm sorry!

01:05:57.303 --> 01:05:59.304
You're the one
who turned it...

01:07:18.092 --> 01:07:19.426
Ian, freeze!

01:07:19.928 --> 01:07:21.386
Get the kids!

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:23.305
Get rid of the flare!

01:07:23.389 --> 01:07:24.640
Get the kids!

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:27.226
Get rid of the flare!

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:31.730
Hail Mary,
full of grace...

01:07:49.415 --> 01:07:50.582
No!

01:07:54.462 --> 01:07:55.754
Dr. Grant!

01:08:00.343 --> 01:08:02.928
I'm stuck.
The seat's got my feet.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:05.305
I'll get you next.
You're okay.

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:08.100
You're all right.

01:08:08.810 --> 01:08:10.435
Tim!

01:08:14.107 --> 01:08:17.024
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:24.509
Lex, you're choking me.

01:09:27.346 --> 01:09:28.596
Grab the wire.

01:09:48.368 --> 01:09:52.245
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

01:09:52.372 --> 01:09:55.540
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

01:09:55.625 --> 01:09:58.919
Look at this next entry. It's the kicker.
"White rabbit object."

01:09:59.045 --> 01:10:01.254
It did it all.
With the keychecks off,

01:10:01.339 --> 01:10:02.965
the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.

01:10:03.049 --> 01:10:06.802
The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.

01:10:06.886 --> 01:10:08.470
How many lines of
code are there?

01:10:08.554 --> 01:10:10.055
About two million.

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:11.807
Two million?
Yeah.

01:10:14.727 --> 01:10:19.398
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.235
and bring back
my grandchildren.

01:10:24.112 --> 01:10:25.278
Sure.

01:10:28.074 --> 01:10:29.574
I'm going with him.

01:10:32.912 --> 01:10:34.079
John.

01:10:39.919 --> 01:10:43.630
I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.

01:10:46.551 --> 01:10:48.176
Should have been
there by now.

01:11:03.443 --> 01:11:04.776
Damn it!

01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:12.868
There's the road!

01:11:19.459 --> 01:11:23.462
Winch this sucker off the thing and
then I tie it to that thing there.

01:11:23.546 --> 01:11:26.965
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

01:11:35.308 --> 01:11:38.727
My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:11.259
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

01:12:18.684 --> 01:12:19.893
Hello.

01:12:24.857 --> 01:12:27.651
Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.

01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:40.205
Nice boy.

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.917
Nice dinosaur.

01:12:44.752 --> 01:12:48.171
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

01:12:48.256 --> 01:12:52.175
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:55.762
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:59.558
Go on. Play fetch?

01:13:01.519 --> 01:13:02.727
Look, stick.

01:13:04.397 --> 01:13:06.565
Look at stick.

01:13:07.233 --> 01:13:10.402
Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
Look at the stick.

01:13:10.903 --> 01:13:13.238
You like the stick?
Go on and get it.

01:13:13.406 --> 01:13:15.240
No wonder you're extinct.

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:19.161
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

01:14:35.196 --> 01:14:36.780
Timmy!

01:14:40.868 --> 01:14:42.911
Now, Lex. Listen.

01:14:43.621 --> 01:14:45.288
Lex, I'm right here.

01:14:45.957 --> 01:14:48.458
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

01:14:48.542 --> 01:14:50.752
Stay right here
and wait for me.

01:14:51.128 --> 01:14:53.463
He left us.

01:14:53.965 --> 01:14:56.466
But that's not what
I'm going to do.

01:14:58.511 --> 01:14:59.678
Okay?

01:15:02.139 --> 01:15:03.265
Stay here.

01:15:30.501 --> 01:15:32.419
You hear me?
I'm coming up.

01:15:33.129 --> 01:15:37.090
I hate climbing.
I hate trees, way too high.

01:16:05.369 --> 01:16:06.453
You okay?

01:16:09.457 --> 01:16:10.707
I threw up.

01:16:13.836 --> 01:16:15.045
That's okay.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.714
Just give me your hand.

01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:25.930
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

01:16:34.982 --> 01:16:36.483
Here, I've got you.

01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.277
Okay.

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:42.280
That's good.
Over the rail.

01:16:42.365 --> 01:16:43.531
Don't pull me too hard.

01:16:48.079 --> 01:16:50.330
- Stand on the door.
- Hang on to me.

01:16:53.959 --> 01:16:56.669
That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
Yes, it is.

01:16:56.754 --> 01:16:59.464
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.091
No.
Yeah, me, too.

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.553
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

01:17:05.638 --> 01:17:07.222
This is impossible.

01:17:07.515 --> 01:17:08.890
How am I going to do this?
It's about...

01:17:08.974 --> 01:17:12.060
I'm going to help you
with your footing.

01:17:15.856 --> 01:17:16.981
Oh, no.

01:17:17.525 --> 01:17:18.817
Tim, go.

01:17:41.173 --> 01:17:42.632
Go, Tim, go!

01:17:50.933 --> 01:17:52.142
Faster, Tim!

01:17:58.858 --> 01:17:59.983
Tim, jump!

01:18:03.988 --> 01:18:05.071
Go, Tim.

01:18:13.539 --> 01:18:15.957
We're back
in the car again.

01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:20.253
At least
you're out of the tree.

01:18:25.634 --> 01:18:28.094
Where's the other car?

01:18:30.514 --> 01:18:31.681
Alan!

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.058
Dr. Grant!

01:18:50.201 --> 01:18:52.243
I think this was Gennaro.

01:18:52.328 --> 01:18:53.620
I think this was, too.

01:18:57.208 --> 01:18:58.208
I think it's ahead of us.

01:18:58.292 --> 01:18:59.751
It could be anywhere.

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:03.046
With fences down, it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes.

01:19:10.221 --> 01:19:12.222
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

01:19:13.933 --> 01:19:16.643
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

01:19:21.649 --> 01:19:23.399
Can we chance moving him?

01:19:24.735 --> 01:19:26.194
Please chance it.

01:19:34.745 --> 01:19:36.329
Ellie, come on!

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.129
It's the other car!

01:19:45.714 --> 01:19:46.965
Dr. Grant?

01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:52.971
They're not here.

01:20:22.334 --> 01:20:23.835
Anybody hear that?

01:20:27.423 --> 01:20:29.841
It's an impact tremor,
is what it is.

01:20:30.718 --> 01:20:32.510
I'm fairly alarmed here.

01:20:33.971 --> 01:20:37.682
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now! Right now!

01:20:38.475 --> 01:20:39.559
Let's go.

01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:52.322
Must go faster.

01:20:54.992 --> 01:20:57.827
Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!

01:21:04.168 --> 01:21:05.918
Get off the stick!
Bloody move!

01:21:06.003 --> 01:21:07.295
Look out!

01:21:34.406 --> 01:21:36.741
Think they'll have
that on the tour?

01:21:44.917 --> 01:21:46.501
Are you hearing this?

01:21:53.092 --> 01:21:55.259
- Come on, Tim.
- Hurry up.

01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:57.929
Let's get up this tree.

01:22:00.891 --> 01:22:03.643
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

01:22:05.479 --> 01:22:06.729
Oh, man.

01:22:07.981 --> 01:22:09.315
I hate trees.

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.192
They don't bother me.

01:22:11.276 --> 01:22:13.486
Yeah? Well, you weren't
in the last one.

01:22:28.127 --> 01:22:31.671
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:34.632
They're singing.

01:23:03.662 --> 01:23:05.705
Don't let the monsters
come over here.

01:23:05.789 --> 01:23:09.208
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:12.837
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:14.589
I hate the other kind.

01:23:16.675 --> 01:23:19.469
They just do what they do.

01:23:39.573 --> 01:23:40.782
What's that?

01:23:45.996 --> 01:23:49.957
What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones any more?

01:23:51.376 --> 01:23:52.627
I don't know.

01:23:53.879 --> 01:23:56.297
I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:06.390
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

01:24:06.475 --> 01:24:08.184
"Do-you-think-he-saurus."

01:24:11.897 --> 01:24:14.398
What do you call
a blind dinosaur's dog?

01:24:15.234 --> 01:24:16.567
You got me.

01:24:16.735 --> 01:24:18.820
A "Do-you-think
- He-saurus rex."

01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:22.323
Alan?

01:24:22.407 --> 01:24:23.574
Yeah?

01:24:24.243 --> 01:24:27.411
What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?

01:24:29.748 --> 01:24:31.916
I'll stay awake.
All night?

01:24:34.545 --> 01:24:35.670
All night.

01:25:25.929 --> 01:25:27.555
They were all melting.

01:25:31.268 --> 01:25:34.395
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

01:25:38.275 --> 01:25:39.817
They'll be fine.

01:25:40.819 --> 01:25:45.114
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

01:25:49.578 --> 01:25:51.329
You know, the first

01:25:52.623 --> 01:25:56.083
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland

01:25:57.753 --> 01:26:00.254
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

01:26:01.632 --> 01:26:03.424
Really quite wonderful.

01:26:04.009 --> 01:26:07.261
I had a wee trapeze
and a

01:26:10.474 --> 01:26:11.682
carousel

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:17.021
and a seesaw.

01:26:18.148 --> 01:26:20.358
They all move motorized,
of course.

01:26:20.692 --> 01:26:23.361
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas."

01:26:23.487 --> 01:26:25.196
"Can't you see the fleas?"

01:26:25.989 --> 01:26:30.284
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:37.959
With this place,

01:26:40.045 --> 01:26:43.464
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

01:26:44.466 --> 01:26:47.551
Something that was real.
Something that they could

01:26:50.722 --> 01:26:52.181
see and touch.

01:26:56.895 --> 01:26:59.355
An aim not
devoid of merit.

01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:07.488
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:11.409
You're absolutely right.

01:27:13.245 --> 01:27:15.579
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:18.332
We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.

01:27:18.417 --> 01:27:21.085
Next time,
everything's correctable.

01:27:21.878 --> 01:27:25.089
Creation is an act
of sheer will.

01:27:27.426 --> 01:27:29.385
Next time,
it'll be flawless.

01:27:29.928 --> 01:27:33.264
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

01:27:33.432 --> 01:27:34.932
When we have control...

01:27:35.017 --> 01:27:37.685
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

01:27:37.853 --> 01:27:40.521
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.357
I made a mistake, too.

01:27:43.442 --> 01:27:47.278
I didn't have enough respect for
that power, and it's out now.

01:27:49.906 --> 01:27:53.075
The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.

01:27:55.245 --> 01:27:57.371
Alan and Lex and Tim.

01:27:58.957 --> 01:28:02.126
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

01:28:19.144 --> 01:28:20.311
It's good.

01:28:24.274 --> 01:28:25.733
Spared no expense.

01:28:53.095 --> 01:28:54.095
Go away!

01:28:54.179 --> 01:28:56.263
It's okay.
It's a Brachiosaurus.

01:28:56.932 --> 01:28:59.600
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

01:29:00.143 --> 01:29:01.352
Veggie.

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.021
Come on. Come on, girl.

01:29:08.276 --> 01:29:09.652
Come on, baby.

01:29:13.115 --> 01:29:14.532
Go.

01:29:16.034 --> 01:29:17.535
I'm not letting go.

01:29:29.506 --> 01:29:30.631
It looks like
it has a cold.

01:29:30.715 --> 01:29:32.341
Yeah. Maybe.

01:29:32.717 --> 01:29:34.343
Can I touch it?
Sure.

01:29:34.678 --> 01:29:37.721
Just think of it
as kind of a big cow.

01:29:41.059 --> 01:29:42.309
I like cows.

01:29:52.362 --> 01:29:54.697
Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

01:30:02.122 --> 01:30:03.414
God bless you.

01:30:08.753 --> 01:30:10.754
- Yuck.
- Great.

01:30:10.839 --> 01:30:12.798
Now she'll never
try anything new.

01:30:13.258 --> 01:30:16.260
She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.

01:30:16.386 --> 01:30:17.344
I'm a hacker.

01:30:17.429 --> 01:30:19.138
That's what I said.
You're a nerd.

01:30:19.264 --> 01:30:20.764
I am not
a computer nerd.

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:22.474
I prefer to be
called a hacker.

01:30:22.726 --> 01:30:23.934
God.

01:30:28.773 --> 01:30:30.441
You know what this is?

01:30:32.319 --> 01:30:34.320
It's a dinosaur egg.

01:30:35.071 --> 01:30:38.282
The dinosaurs are breeding.

01:30:41.453 --> 01:30:45.497
But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

01:30:46.917 --> 01:30:49.126
Amphibian DNA.
What's that?

01:30:50.921 --> 01:30:52.963
Well, on the tour,

01:30:53.173 --> 01:30:57.968
the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

01:30:58.136 --> 01:31:01.472
They mutated the dinosaur
genetic code

01:31:02.474 --> 01:31:04.767
and blended it with
that of frogs.

01:31:07.646 --> 01:31:12.107
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female

01:31:12.192 --> 01:31:14.276
in a single sex environment.

01:31:16.154 --> 01:31:17.655
Malcolm was right.

01:31:19.199 --> 01:31:20.366
Look.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.709
Life found a way.

01:31:33.046 --> 01:31:35.631
- No. That's crazy.
- You're out of your mind.

01:31:35.715 --> 01:31:37.675
He's absolutely
out of his mind.

01:31:38.343 --> 01:31:40.511
Wait.
What exactly would this mean?

01:31:40.637 --> 01:31:42.638
We're talking about
a calculated risk,

01:31:42.722 --> 01:31:44.473
which is the only
option left to us.

01:31:44.557 --> 01:31:49.019
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

01:31:49.521 --> 01:31:52.356
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

01:31:52.482 --> 01:31:54.942
So, shutting down
the entire system...

01:31:55.026 --> 01:31:56.986
Get somebody else.
I won't do it.

01:31:57.070 --> 01:32:02.074
Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did.

01:32:03.368 --> 01:32:06.996
Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back

01:32:07.163 --> 01:32:09.873
on their original
start-up mode. Correct?

01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:13.377
Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.

01:32:13.503 --> 01:32:14.712
It may not come back on.

01:32:14.796 --> 01:32:16.463
Would we get
the phones back?

01:32:16.548 --> 01:32:18.215
Yes, again, in theory.

01:32:18.842 --> 01:32:20.676
What about
the lysine contingency?

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:22.219
We could put
that into effect.

01:32:22.345 --> 01:32:23.304
What's that?

01:32:23.388 --> 01:32:25.139
That's absolutely out
of the question.

01:32:25.223 --> 01:32:28.058
The lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals,

01:32:28.184 --> 01:32:30.019
if they ever get
off the island.

01:32:30.103 --> 01:32:33.772
Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

01:32:33.898 --> 01:32:36.775
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

01:32:36.901 --> 01:32:40.612
Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.

01:32:40.739 --> 01:32:43.198
People are dying.

01:32:47.412 --> 01:32:49.747
Will you please shut
down the system?

01:33:11.770 --> 01:33:13.437
Hold on to your butts.

01:33:33.291 --> 01:33:34.416
It's okay.

01:33:34.542 --> 01:33:37.211
Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:42.091
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

01:33:42.175 --> 01:33:43.801
Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

01:33:43.885 --> 01:33:46.303
Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:

01:33:46.388 --> 01:33:49.765
Telephones, security doors, half
dozen others, but it worked.

01:33:49.849 --> 01:33:51.934
System's ready.
Where are the breakers?

01:33:52.018 --> 01:33:54.061
Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.

01:33:54.145 --> 01:33:56.897
Three minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.

01:33:56.981 --> 01:34:00.067
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker

01:34:00.151 --> 01:34:03.487
until Mr. Arnold returns, and the
whole system's running again.

01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.239
I'm tired.
I'm dirty.

01:34:05.323 --> 01:34:06.698
I'm hot.

01:34:06.908 --> 01:34:10.661
Looking at the map, I'd say the
visitor's center is just a mile

01:34:11.329 --> 01:34:14.623
over that rise there.
Just keep...

01:34:17.502 --> 01:34:19.002
What is that?

01:34:21.297 --> 01:34:23.507
Tim, can you tell me
what they are?

01:34:24.884 --> 01:34:26.218
They are

01:34:30.557 --> 01:34:31.807
Gallimimus.

01:34:31.891 --> 01:34:34.393
Are those meat-eating?

01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.438
"Meat-asauruses"?

01:34:42.318 --> 01:34:44.778
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

01:34:44.863 --> 01:34:47.531
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

01:34:49.033 --> 01:34:52.202
They're flocking this way.

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:36.163
I want to go now.

01:35:36.247 --> 01:35:37.331
Just look how it eats.

01:35:37.415 --> 01:35:38.707
Please.

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:41.585
I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.754
Yes.
Go now.

01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:48.258
Okay. Keep low
and follow me.

01:35:50.678 --> 01:35:52.429
Look how much blood.

01:35:54.682 --> 01:35:56.767
God. Something went wrong.

01:35:57.685 --> 01:36:01.230
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

01:36:03.942 --> 01:36:05.526
This is just a delay.

01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:08.695
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

01:36:08.947 --> 01:36:13.283
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:16.036
If the Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:17.371
the pirates don't
eat tourists.

01:36:17.455 --> 01:36:20.916
I can't wait any more.
Something's wrong.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.376
I'm gonna go get
the power back on.

01:36:22.627 --> 01:36:25.754
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?

01:36:25.922 --> 01:36:29.216
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone...

01:36:31.886 --> 01:36:33.929
I'm going with you.
Okay.

01:36:49.571 --> 01:36:50.779
Sorry.

01:36:54.617 --> 01:36:58.829
Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.

01:36:58.997 --> 01:37:02.332
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

01:37:06.796 --> 01:37:08.005
Right.

01:37:14.012 --> 01:37:16.013
But it ought to be me,
really, going.

01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:17.097
Why?

01:37:17.181 --> 01:37:19.016
I'm a... And you're a...

01:37:20.476 --> 01:37:22.769
Look.
Come on, let's go.

01:37:22.854 --> 01:37:26.106
We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.

01:37:26.190 --> 01:37:29.860
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:30.986
Right.

01:38:06.856 --> 01:38:09.566
The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.

01:38:10.234 --> 01:38:13.904
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

01:38:19.577 --> 01:38:20.827
Come on, this way.

01:38:28.544 --> 01:38:30.504
I can see the shed
from here.

01:38:30.713 --> 01:38:32.422
We can make it if we run.

01:38:32.757 --> 01:38:35.342
No. We can't.

01:38:36.260 --> 01:38:37.552
Why not?

01:38:38.054 --> 01:38:39.971
Because we're being hunted.

01:38:41.307 --> 01:38:43.308
In the bushes,
straight ahead.

01:38:45.937 --> 01:38:47.270
It's all right.

01:38:47.814 --> 01:38:49.231
Like hell it is.

01:38:50.566 --> 01:38:53.735
Run. Towards the shed.

01:38:55.947 --> 01:38:57.406
I've got her.

01:38:58.324 --> 01:38:59.825
Go. Now!

01:39:19.011 --> 01:39:20.429
Mr. Arnold?

01:39:25.768 --> 01:39:26.977
John, I'm in.

01:39:27.603 --> 01:39:28.812
Great.

01:39:30.106 --> 01:39:33.608
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

01:39:34.652 --> 01:39:36.945
Okay. Going down.

01:39:37.822 --> 01:39:41.575
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

01:39:41.659 --> 01:39:42.826
Have her follow
the main cable.

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.828
I know how to read
a schematic.

01:40:15.151 --> 01:40:17.360
I guess that means
the power's off.

01:40:30.583 --> 01:40:31.958
That's not funny.

01:40:32.043 --> 01:40:33.210
That was great.

01:40:35.713 --> 01:40:37.672
Well, maybe we, we could...

01:40:55.525 --> 01:40:58.026
Damn it. Dead end.

01:40:58.402 --> 01:40:59.611
Wait a minute.

01:41:01.197 --> 01:41:04.449
There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.

01:41:05.409 --> 01:41:07.035
Look above you.

01:41:07.912 --> 01:41:11.748
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.

01:41:11.874 --> 01:41:13.041
Follow that.

01:41:13.709 --> 01:41:15.877
Okay. Following the piping.

01:41:18.548 --> 01:41:22.968
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

01:41:23.094 --> 01:41:24.344
What would you give me?

01:41:24.428 --> 01:41:25.470
Respect.

01:41:26.389 --> 01:41:28.431
Come on, guys,
it's not a race.

01:41:30.101 --> 01:41:31.309
I see the box.

01:41:33.104 --> 01:41:36.106
It says, "High Voltage."
Yeah.

01:41:39.151 --> 01:41:40.318
Okay.

01:41:44.282 --> 01:41:46.950
Good. Here we go.

01:41:47.618 --> 01:41:48.785
Over the top.

01:41:49.453 --> 01:41:51.079
Take your time.

01:41:52.081 --> 01:41:53.623
Good. Come on.

01:41:53.791 --> 01:41:55.750
Find your footing.

01:41:57.962 --> 01:42:00.672
You can't throw
the main switch by hand.

01:42:00.798 --> 01:42:04.175
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

01:42:04.302 --> 01:42:06.636
It's large, flat, and gray.

01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:09.306
All right,
here I go. Okay?

01:42:10.892 --> 01:42:15.979
One, two, three, four.

01:42:16.439 --> 01:42:18.023
Okay, charged.

01:42:18.774 --> 01:42:22.527
Under the words "Contact Position
," there's a round green button

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:25.155
which says "Push to Close."

01:42:25.698 --> 01:42:27.532
Push to close.

01:42:31.037 --> 01:42:32.329
Push it.

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:51.222
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

01:42:52.099 --> 01:42:53.391
Switch them on.

01:43:04.904 --> 01:43:05.904
Get down now!

01:43:05.988 --> 01:43:07.113
You're gonna have to jump.

01:43:07.198 --> 01:43:09.032
You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:10.367
Do what Dr. Grant says!

01:43:10.451 --> 01:43:11.743
Let go.
I'll count to three.

01:43:11.869 --> 01:43:14.245
One, two, three!

01:43:15.206 --> 01:43:17.582
Four. Five.

01:43:18.376 --> 01:43:20.085
I'm coming up to get you.

01:43:20.211 --> 01:43:21.711
I've got to get Tim.

01:43:21.879 --> 01:43:23.546
Okay. I'm gonna
count to three.

01:43:26.425 --> 01:43:27.634
One,

01:43:29.387 --> 01:43:30.470
two...

01:43:41.565 --> 01:43:43.066
He's not breathing.

01:43:47.989 --> 01:43:50.407
I think we're back
in business!

01:43:58.624 --> 01:44:00.083
No!

01:45:30.174 --> 01:45:31.424
Clever girl.

01:45:55.741 --> 01:45:57.033
No, Tim!

01:45:59.787 --> 01:46:01.704
Good boy.

01:46:06.252 --> 01:46:07.460
Three.

01:46:12.633 --> 01:46:13.716
Hello?

01:46:23.894 --> 01:46:27.313
Okay. I'm gonna have
to find the others.

01:46:28.399 --> 01:46:31.151
Get you to a doctor.

01:46:33.195 --> 01:46:35.488
Lex, you look after Tim.
Yeah.

01:46:36.782 --> 01:46:38.741
Your hair is
all sticking up.

01:46:40.744 --> 01:46:43.037
Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.

01:46:47.334 --> 01:46:49.502
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

01:47:16.822 --> 01:47:17.947
Run.

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.359
Just the two Raptors, right?

01:48:37.861 --> 01:48:39.737
You sure the third
one's contained?

01:48:39.822 --> 01:48:43.408
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

01:49:10.019 --> 01:49:11.853
What is it?

01:49:11.937 --> 01:49:13.313
It's a Velociraptor.

01:49:15.983 --> 01:49:17.483
It's inside.

01:49:43.052 --> 01:49:44.135
Follow me.

01:52:19.708 --> 01:52:20.958
It's in there.

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.085
Control room.

01:52:29.426 --> 01:52:30.510
We can
call for help?

01:52:30.594 --> 01:52:32.929
We've got to reboot
the system first.

01:52:35.557 --> 01:52:36.849
The door locks!

01:52:37.768 --> 01:52:39.810
Ellie, boot up
the door locks!

01:52:49.321 --> 01:52:51.155
No, boot up
the door locks!

01:52:52.199 --> 01:52:54.200
Get back! Boot up
the door locks.

01:52:54.284 --> 01:52:56.035
You can't hold it
by yourself!

01:53:04.461 --> 01:53:07.964
It's a UNIX system.
I know this.

01:53:08.715 --> 01:53:10.800
It's all the files
of the whole park.

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:14.136
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:16.472
Try to reach the gun.

01:53:24.982 --> 01:53:26.941
I can't get it
unless I move.

01:53:42.666 --> 01:53:44.834
This is it. This might
be the right file.

01:54:00.976 --> 01:54:02.560
You got it!
Yes!

01:54:06.023 --> 01:54:07.273
Did it!

01:54:07.524 --> 01:54:08.858
Yes!

01:54:13.113 --> 01:54:14.322
What works?

01:54:14.406 --> 01:54:17.116
All security systems
are enabled. We got it.

01:54:27.002 --> 01:54:28.210
Grant.

01:54:28.295 --> 01:54:31.213
Mr. Hammond,
the phones are working.

01:54:31.715 --> 01:54:32.965
The children all right?

01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:34.383
The children are fine.

01:54:34.885 --> 01:54:38.721
Call the mainland.
Tell them to send the damn helicopters.

01:54:39.514 --> 01:54:41.682
It's gonna cut
through the glass!

01:55:33.402 --> 01:55:34.568
Move!

01:56:20.115 --> 01:56:22.658
Tim, let go. Yeah!

01:57:40.028 --> 01:57:44.323
After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.

01:57:45.075 --> 01:57:46.492
So have I.

01:58:34.082 --> 01:58:35.124
Come on.
