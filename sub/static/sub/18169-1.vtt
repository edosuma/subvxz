00:26.901 --> 00:29.611
( insects chirping )

00:52.010 --> 00:54.720
( theme music playing )

03:04.517 --> 03:05.934
Waiter!

03:16.154 --> 03:19.489
- What's that?
- Oh my God.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.991
Hi.

03:36.507 --> 03:38.675
- Madam.
- Thank you.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.349
( horn honks )

03:51.648 --> 03:53.523
Woman:
Hang on one second.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.192
- ( whispers )
- Woman: Well, yes.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.196
Hang on one second.
One second.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.823
Hi. Sorry l'm late.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.825
Cassie Jay, l'm the features
editor at the paper.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.036
We spoke on the phone earlier.
It's, um...

04:07.121 --> 04:08.121
Laura Quinn.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.958
Robin, go ahead.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.420
I got front page?
( mouths words )

04:15.463 --> 04:16.755
Perfect. Thanks.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.839
Thanks, bye.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.553
Whoo! We should be careful
what we wish for. Hmm.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.015
Having it all at 25 cannot
be bioIogicaIIy correct.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.309
So, thank you
for contacting us.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.938
As you know, we're running a series
of features called "Women Who Led,"

04:32.981 --> 04:35.774
all about the everyday women
who back in the Iate '50s,

04:35.817 --> 04:38.777
the early '60s, started breaking
the boundaries,

04:38.820 --> 04:40.904
really inventing
the modern woman.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.948
A lot of people who
turned up in our research

04:42.991 --> 04:44.950
turned out to be dead,
but you're...

04:47.829 --> 04:51.123
alive, so that's great.

04:51.165 --> 04:54.084
I, um, I need
to paint a picture.

04:54.127 --> 04:58.130
You're hired by the London
Diamond Corporation.

04:58.172 --> 05:01.633
lt's number one in the world.
But it's the '50s.

05:01.676 --> 05:05.137
lt's a fiercely
male-dominated environment.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.888
You take on the men.

05:06.931 --> 05:11.601
You battle your way up
and become... a manager.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.187
Well, that's not going to impress
anyone these days,

05:14.230 --> 05:17.357
but you were the only female
manager that had ever existed

05:17.400 --> 05:21.153
in that company and l want
to know your story.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.114
You know, l haven't
set foot in this city

05:24.157 --> 05:26.158
as a free woman
in over 40 years.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.870
- Really?
- lt's changed.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.804
lt's an exceptional
piece, isn't it?

05:47.847 --> 05:50.599
168 carats,

05:50.641 --> 05:52.559
58 facets...

05:52.602 --> 05:54.269
very rare.

06:00.693 --> 06:03.153
l stole it...

06:03.196 --> 06:05.197
from London Diamond.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.584
A good deal took place
at London Diamond

06:17.627 --> 06:19.378
that may not be
in your notes.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.132
You've been in prison.
That's where you've been.

06:41.984 --> 06:44.569
- Good morning, gentIemen.
- Miss Quinn, good morning.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.321
Good morning,
Miss Quinn.

06:57.500 --> 07:00.001
- Good morning, Miss Quinn.
- Good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.464
Aiming to beat
the sunrise, Miss Quinn?

07:04.507 --> 07:08.009
Obliterate, Henry.
ObIiterate.

08:29.842 --> 08:33.010
No more blood for diamonds!

08:34.138 --> 08:36.139
l see our fan club
has assembIed.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.183
( yelling )

08:45.566 --> 08:47.317
Murderer!

08:47.360 --> 08:49.027
Murderers!

08:52.114 --> 08:53.657
Good morning, Sir Milton.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.117
Good morning,
Sir Milton.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.536
Morning, gents.
Good morning.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.791
l'm sure by now
you're aII aware

09:02.833 --> 09:06.586
tensions reached a head
yesterday in Kimstad.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.463
- What are the final figures?
- What do you mean?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.966
- Dead? How many dead?
- 100, give or take,

09:11.008 --> 09:13.176
- most of them on our payroll.
- It is a cock-up.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.845
Everyone is pointing
their fingers at us.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.806
Christ Almighty!

09:17.848 --> 09:20.684
The whole pissing South African
regime is our fauIt.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.435
What are the Soviets saying?

09:22.478 --> 09:24.688
l'm afraid the Russians
are leading the charge.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.315
- They're pressing for UN sanctions.
- They're going to war with us

09:27.358 --> 09:29.150
the week that we are
renewing their contracts.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.736
- We don't need the Russians.
- With respect, sir,

09:31.779 --> 09:34.364
if the Soviets broke away,
it wouId be disastrous.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.242
They could align with Botswana,

09:37.285 --> 09:39.286
Sierra Leone
or even Angola.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.246
Combined production
would exceed our own.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.832
We wouId no Ionger
control global supply.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.709
The cartel collapses
and prices would free fall.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.712
The Russians are paid well above market.
They won't break ranks.

09:48.754 --> 09:52.257
ln any case, officials from the Soviet
Diamond Trading Organization

09:52.300 --> 09:54.092
are en route as we speak.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.803
Precisely.
To end our relationship.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.765
Very well.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.809
Now we have two days--

10:02.852 --> 10:04.769
two days to find a solution.

10:04.812 --> 10:09.399
- ( mumbles )
- Wait wait, uh, um...

10:09.442 --> 10:11.818
one final item.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.154
l'd like you to join me
in congratuIating

10:14.196 --> 10:16.323
our newest
managing director,

10:16.365 --> 10:19.284
who, God willing, will keep
us afIoat in Cape Town,

10:19.327 --> 10:21.119
Mr. Peter Boland.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.121
Congratulations.
WeII done.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.970
l'm speechless.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.805
Boland over you?

10:40.848 --> 10:42.641
The old man
is losing his mind.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.392
No, he's thinking straight.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.936
In addition to being
several years my senior,

10:46.979 --> 10:49.981
BoIand's experience
is far better suited to the position.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.984
Besides, they're doing
me a favor.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.988
Didn't you know? Cape Town's
a furnace in the summer.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.033
l hope that they've got something
better Iined up for you.

11:16.676 --> 11:21.388
( thinking ) "Lon Di subsidiaries
worldwide, 1 ,223;

11:21.430 --> 11:25.100
female managing directors, 0."

11:40.533 --> 11:44.452
"Don't give up.

11:44.495 --> 11:48.832
Work harder.

11:48.874 --> 11:53.211
You will win."

12:10.855 --> 12:13.648
You forgot again.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.316
- Lunch?
- Lunch?

12:15.359 --> 12:17.444
lt's a holiday--
middle of the day.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.946
People meet, unwind,
buy makeup, plot against men.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.948
- Oh, it's all the rage.
- l'm so sorry.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.701
Look, it's one crisis after another.
Can we reschedule?

12:24.744 --> 12:27.954
Tuesday it is, but not with me,
with Kenneth Pearson,

12:27.997 --> 12:30.123
a friend of mine that
would like to meet you.

12:30.166 --> 12:35.128
Judy, it's so kind, but l really
don't Iike the name Kenneth.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.297
Don't Ieave it
too long, Laura.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.716
There won't be any plots left.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.352
Oh, working late again,
Miss Quinn?

12:53.939 --> 12:56.858
Always the first to arrive
and the Iast to Ieave.

12:58.694 --> 13:01.863
Your colleagues must value
your dedication.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.159
What's that bit from
the, uh, from the Bible?

13:06.202 --> 13:10.914
You know, "He who
is Iast shaII be first

13:10.956 --> 13:14.042
and he who is first
shaII be Iast."

13:14.084 --> 13:16.461
- ls that how it goes?
- Yeah.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.713
What a load of rubbish.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.217
We aII know you
take what you desire.

13:22.259 --> 13:25.637
Fortune favors the bold.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.559
Take those South Africans,
for exampIe.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.604
Do you think we should
hand them their freedom

13:34.647 --> 13:36.606
or let them seize it
for themselves?

13:36.649 --> 13:40.318
Well, that's an interesting debate--
a dangerous one maybe.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.778
But for my money,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.239
l'd say things are never as
simpIe as they seem.

13:44.281 --> 13:48.117
l'm sure you're right, Miss Quinn.
You're the one with the suit.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.954
Good night.

13:52.498 --> 13:53.581
Good luck.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.636
Living dangerously,
Miss Quinn?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.806
Recklessly, Henry.
ReckIessIy.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.984
( jazz music playing )

15:23.839 --> 15:26.257
Sir MiIton: Something
troubling you, Miss Quinn?

15:26.300 --> 15:30.595
The existing Russian contract:
I propose we simpIy extend it.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.848
l'm sorry. You've lost me.
Was it not you

15:33.891 --> 15:36.976
who suggested the Russians were
on their way here to sever all ties?

15:37.019 --> 15:40.271
lf we allow the Soviets to publicly
disassociate with London Diamond,

15:40.314 --> 15:42.440
let them pound the table at the UN,

15:42.483 --> 15:45.610
denounce racist capitalism
and so on and so on,

15:45.653 --> 15:48.488
but secretIy
we extend our contract

15:48.530 --> 15:51.491
and keep it a strictly
private matter,

15:51.533 --> 15:53.910
at least until the storm
has passed over.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.829
While they continue to wholesale
diamonds at a magnificent price.

15:56.872 --> 15:58.748
That's not bad.
That's not bad at all.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.962
Who eIse have
you told about this?

16:04.004 --> 16:07.131
Man: He's much better at the job
than Albert ever was.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.759
ln such a short time.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.428
Laura, is that you?

16:12.471 --> 16:15.348
Harold Reynolds, good God.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.558
GentIemen, this Iady
is the cleverest person

16:17.601 --> 16:19.769
I've ever met--
and she's American.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.563
Ran circIes around
the lot of us at Oxford.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.649
Of course I don't
talk to her anymore.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.734
She turned me down
for dinner three times.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.403
l was just testing his resolve.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.697
lf he had tried one more time,
I wouId have said yes.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.408
l'm at Allied Banking
heading up syndications.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.702
We've just been sweating
over your accounts,

16:35.744 --> 16:37.662
a lot of ice down there.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.623
No doubt impressive,
but it's making people nervous.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.710
But now l know you're here,
l can sleep a little easier.

16:43.752 --> 16:47.130
Um, unIess of course you're
considering a career change?

16:47.172 --> 16:50.925
At AIIied Banking
world domination can also be arranged.

17:08.902 --> 17:12.070
Henry: Earliest and brightest
as usuaI, Miss Quinn.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.449
Oh, l do my best, Henry.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.200
Thank you.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.802
"No, you won't"?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.690
( dramatic music playing )

18:00.287 --> 18:02.747
Miss Quinn. Miss Quinn.
Why don't we sit in there?

18:02.790 --> 18:05.958
- Mr. Hobbs?
- Yes.

18:06.001 --> 18:10.254
Mr. Hobbs, l'm flattered,
but l'm-- l'm-- l'm really not looking--

18:10.297 --> 18:12.632
Oh, please-- please don't panic,
Miss Quinn.

18:12.674 --> 18:15.927
I'm-- I'm a happiIy married man.
And l wouldn't be so courageous.

18:15.969 --> 18:18.137
l-- l have a proposal
to put to you.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.389
lt's-- it's a trifle.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.600
Just give me
five minutes. Please.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.319
Come and sit.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.780
It's something
l do to get sympathy.

18:35.823 --> 18:38.741
War wound-- the Blitz.

18:38.784 --> 18:42.245
My wife and I, we went
for some music at Wilton's.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.081
Very explosive performance.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.917
Anyway, we both
survived that one,

18:47.960 --> 18:51.462
onIy to find out that my wife
was living on borrowed time.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.423
l thought you were
happily married?

18:54.466 --> 18:55.925
Oh, l am, Miss Quinn,

18:55.968 --> 18:57.635
and l always will be.

18:59.138 --> 19:03.099
Are you always in the habit of reading
private correspondence?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.601
Would you hold these
for me, pIease?

19:05.644 --> 19:07.436
Correspondence?

19:07.479 --> 19:10.815
This is more like
a diary of frustration.

19:13.110 --> 19:18.030
"Number of Lon Di subsidiaries
worIdwide, 1 ,223;

19:18.073 --> 19:22.076
number of female
managing directors, 0."

19:22.119 --> 19:24.036
That first number is not correct.

19:24.079 --> 19:27.415
lt's 1 ,224 now,

19:27.457 --> 19:31.335
but the other number,
that is quite accurate.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.880
You've succeeded
in arousing my curiosity.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.424
Now I'm wondering
what it is you want.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.760
Well, l-- l think the question is,
Miss Quinn, is

19:39.803 --> 19:41.971
what is it that you want?

19:43.891 --> 19:45.892
Hey, this is ridiculous.

19:45.934 --> 19:48.144
They're-- they're going
to knock over a bank

19:48.187 --> 19:50.646
in the middle of London
in broad dayIight.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.613
I couId have
yourjob for this.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.741
Yeah, and they might
just give it to you.

20:01.783 --> 20:04.243
l know that you've been
passed over six times

20:04.286 --> 20:08.164
in the last three years for someone
Iess quaIified than you.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.291
You know this has
been illuminating,

20:10.334 --> 20:12.668
- but l am really am very very busy.
- Miss Quinn, please.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.297
Please sit down.
Please sit down. Please.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.885
l-- l haven't got
to my point yet.

20:20.928 --> 20:25.139
- They're going to fire you.
- Excuse me?

20:25.182 --> 20:28.434
Yes, your ingenious
Russian proposaI.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.145
How do you know about that?
How do you know all of my business?

20:31.188 --> 20:33.356
- Shh!
- All: Shh!

20:34.441 --> 20:36.108
l'm only trying to help.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.197
You know,
it's extraordinary

20:41.240 --> 20:44.367
the conversations people will have
in front of the cIeaners.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.410
It's Iike--
like we don't exist.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.204
What conversations?

20:48.247 --> 20:51.374
WeII, I'm no businessman,
but l certainly got the gist of it.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.708
What conversations?

20:52.751 --> 20:55.169
WeII, the Russians
won't accept your plan

20:55.212 --> 20:58.214
unless it's kept secret
among senior staff

20:58.257 --> 21:00.633
and only the senior staff.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.428
They don't seem to think
that you qualify.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.807
Well, l don't believe you.

21:07.849 --> 21:10.059
Well, uh, you--
you're probably right.

21:10.102 --> 21:13.437
The ramblings
of an old man, eh?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.439
Who would notice?

21:15.482 --> 21:17.108
Hey, this is a good bit.

21:17.150 --> 21:18.484
Look there.

21:20.487 --> 21:22.154
Would you like a peanut?

21:42.509 --> 21:44.260
Oh, is MKA in?

21:44.303 --> 21:46.178
- He's just left.
- That's odd.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.639
Someone from the prime minister's
office is in the lobby.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.100
- Says he has an appointment.
- Hmm.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.687
Oh no,
that's not right at all.

22:43.445 --> 22:44.904
Ahem.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.323
Well, l seem to be the envy
of the whoIe restaurant.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.033
You look wonderful.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.952
Well, l heard reinvention
was the latest craze.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.704
Thought l'd try it on for size.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.165
Thank you for seeing me.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.167
Well, don't thank me
too quickly.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.044
Um, ahem.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.258
It's bad news, I'm afraid.
We can't offer you a position.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.843
Really, why not?

23:07.886 --> 23:10.429
There's a conflict
of interests.

23:10.472 --> 23:13.766
Lon Di is our largest client,
back to the Boer War.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.603
We funded Ernest Ashtoncroft's
first diamond mine 70 years ago.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.397
Well, it's done all the time.

23:19.439 --> 23:22.024
You simply ask their permission
to speak with me,

23:22.067 --> 23:24.443
say l know nothing about it--
unsoIicited,

23:24.486 --> 23:26.362
- that sort of thing.
- l did.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.865
Look, and l tell you this
in confidence as an old friend,

23:29.908 --> 23:32.368
but they're saying you're
grossly incompetent--

23:32.411 --> 23:35.121
claim you botched their
relations with the Russians.

23:35.163 --> 23:38.791
That is absolutely ridiculous.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.626
l am sorry.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.379
Word came down quietly
you are not to be touched by us,

23:43.422 --> 23:45.714
or in all likelihood

23:45.757 --> 23:48.467
by anyone doing business
with Lon Di.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.970
Well, that's every
last company on earth.

23:54.724 --> 23:57.685
You said you, um,
had something else to discuss.

24:00.355 --> 24:03.899
Well, l... l feel stupid now.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.944
l was going to finally accept
your offer of dinner.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.406
Well, that, um, would have
to be unadventurous.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.241
Married now five years,

24:12.284 --> 24:15.161
three rather boisterous
girls to prove it.

24:15.203 --> 24:16.871
You should come
over one Sunday.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.666
Mmm, good soup.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.323
Early lunch, Miss Quinn?

24:52.365 --> 24:54.950
Very early and very long.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.785
l'm taking the afternoon off.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.269
( gasps )

25:50.173 --> 25:53.634
- Placed a bet, Miss Quinn?
- Oh, l never gamble.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.720
Not on dogs,
cards or strangers.

25:56.763 --> 25:58.472
You were right.

25:58.515 --> 25:59.974
Was l?

26:00.016 --> 26:03.102
Why do you want to steal
from the company?

26:03.144 --> 26:06.146
- Who said l did?
- Hypothetically.

26:07.190 --> 26:08.482
War and plunder,

26:08.525 --> 26:11.235
the two most reliable
sources of income.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.362
I didn't reaIize.
Are we at war?

26:13.405 --> 26:15.364
( rings )

26:20.412 --> 26:21.787
ln six months' time

26:21.830 --> 26:24.373
I shaII retire
to a hearty pat on the back

26:24.416 --> 26:26.709
and a not-to-hearty pension,

26:26.751 --> 26:29.753
a situation
in dire need of attention.

26:29.796 --> 26:32.881
So money, plain and simple?

26:32.924 --> 26:36.176
Suppose l wanted to do
something for my wife.

26:36.219 --> 26:38.220
Your wife
who died 15 years ago?

26:38.263 --> 26:40.389
The one you're
happily married to?

26:40.432 --> 26:42.433
LoveIy.
You did your homework.

26:42.475 --> 26:44.018
l guess you would.

26:44.060 --> 26:46.979
- What else did you uncover?
- That you're far from stupid,

26:47.022 --> 26:49.773
and you were forced
to apprentice under your father--

26:49.816 --> 26:51.817
a plumber
with a drinking problem.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.779
Oh, yes, married at 21 . And years
Iater when your wife became iII,

26:55.822 --> 26:58.032
you took the night job
at London Diamond

26:58.074 --> 27:00.159
so you could spend
your days by her side.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.328
You never did use
those qualifications.

27:04.664 --> 27:07.249
Clever, Miss Quinn.

27:07.292 --> 27:08.584
Clever.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.419
How do you know
l won't turn you in?

27:10.462 --> 27:12.588
Are we still speaking
hypotheticaIIy?

27:12.631 --> 27:15.341
What makes you think
you could pull off such a thing?

27:15.383 --> 27:17.885
Well, simply because
l have a plan.

27:27.312 --> 27:31.940
What l propose involves
the Ieast possibIe risk

27:31.983 --> 27:36.153
because we don't have to change
our normaI routines.

27:37.656 --> 27:41.450
Each night at 9:00

27:41.493 --> 27:43.452
they lock the front doors,

27:43.495 --> 27:45.287
which means
that for 10 hours

27:48.375 --> 27:51.126
They increase the security
on the main floor,

27:51.169 --> 27:54.046
but on the lower floor they just
keep these two guards,

27:54.089 --> 27:57.466
here and here by the lift,

27:57.509 --> 27:59.968
which is the sole
point of access.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.971
You intend to go
for the vault?

28:03.014 --> 28:05.808
- That's where the diamonds are.
- You can't be serious.

28:05.850 --> 28:10.062
Generally, each evening
l start on the fourth floor

28:10.105 --> 28:12.773
and work me way down, see?

28:15.985 --> 28:17.695
Nice day today.

28:17.737 --> 28:20.030
Hobbs: Once through
the upper floors

28:20.073 --> 28:23.242
I'm escorted
to the sub-basement.

28:29.624 --> 28:32.084
The next few hours are spent
on rubbish coIIection,

28:43.138 --> 28:47.224
During that time
l work mostly unattended.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.062
Once an hour or so
someone checks up on me.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.444
Otherwise I'm Ieft
entirely to myself.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.778
l mean, in theory,

28:59.821 --> 29:03.115
l could take off all my clothes
and walk around naked.

29:03.158 --> 29:06.618
A frightening thought, Miss Quinn.
Don't dwell on it.

29:06.661 --> 29:08.537
l'll try not to.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.873
I save the vauIt
hallway for last--

29:10.915 --> 29:14.001
the long corridor that leads
to a circular door

29:14.043 --> 29:16.211
behind which lies

29:16.254 --> 29:21.258
one of the largest single
deposits of riches on earth.

29:23.261 --> 29:25.721
For 16 years
l've been working

29:25.764 --> 29:27.890
within a hair's
breadth of that door

29:27.932 --> 29:32.561
and for 16 years l've never
opened it, not once.

29:32.604 --> 29:36.023
You couldn't if you wanted to,
not without the codes.

29:36.065 --> 29:39.026
The codes are changed weekIy
and entrusted to only two people.

29:39.068 --> 29:43.280
Mr. Eaton, lifelong company servant,
portrait of reliability.

29:43.323 --> 29:47.951
Rumor has it that the Swiss
use his pulse to set their clocks by;

29:47.994 --> 29:51.747
And, of course,
Sir Milton Kendrick Ashtoncroft,

29:51.790 --> 29:54.416
aging ruler of everything
that daylight touches.

29:54.459 --> 29:57.920
And you plan to obtain
the codes how?

29:57.962 --> 30:00.088
That's where you come in,
Miss Quinn.

30:00.131 --> 30:04.301
Until recently, this was supposed
to be a soIo operation.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.597
A year ago, quite by accident,

30:08.640 --> 30:12.976
I discovered that Sir MiIton kept
the codes concealed in his desk.

30:35.041 --> 30:38.085
Then some months back,
they were gone.

30:39.337 --> 30:42.381
Night after night
l searched the office,

30:42.423 --> 30:44.758
but they never turned up.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.636
Why'd you wait? Why not do it
whiIe you had the chance?

30:47.679 --> 30:51.014
Oh, I've asked myseIf
that question a thousand times.

30:51.057 --> 30:54.643
I toId you, I'm--
l'm not courageous.

30:54.686 --> 30:57.896
But my hesitating
will be your gain.

30:57.939 --> 31:00.607
Will it? And what
wiII that require?

31:00.650 --> 31:03.151
Here, proof of conviction.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.363
You are on the, uh,
guest list, are you?

31:08.199 --> 31:09.950
lt's business.
l'm expected.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.786
We're entertaining
the Russians.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.955
You suspect he keeps
the codes at home?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.666
On Saturday, go to his study

31:17.709 --> 31:20.127
and look under the center
drawer in his desk.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.671
This is ridiculous.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.464
Say l did find the codes

31:24.507 --> 31:27.467
and you were able to slip in
and out of the vault undetected.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.178
How would you get
the diamonds out of the building?

31:37.937 --> 31:40.314
How much will it hold?

31:40.356 --> 31:43.317
How much wouId
you like it to hold?

31:43.359 --> 31:45.861
What's the price of revenge?

31:45.904 --> 31:48.363
Difficult, eh?

31:48.406 --> 31:50.532
Would £1 million do?

31:52.201 --> 31:54.202
Each?
l should think so.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.997
They wouldn't even
notice that much.

31:57.040 --> 31:58.332
Well, by then...

31:58.374 --> 32:01.001
l'll be retired and you'll
have been let go.

32:01.044 --> 32:04.004
- Why shouId I trust you?
- The same reason l have to trust you.

32:04.047 --> 32:06.048
We have the same objective.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.383
Oh, you make it all
sound so easy.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.635
ls that a yes?

32:09.677 --> 32:11.094
No, it isn't.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.724
Be sure to wear
something nice.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.002
Good evening, sir.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.595
Sir Milton: Welcome, Clifton.
Come on in.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.014
Clifton:
The Russians here?

32:58.851 --> 33:00.352
( classical music playing )

33:22.000 --> 33:24.001
Man:
To pressurized carbon.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.587
Hear hear!

33:31.175 --> 33:33.135
Now that's
a sight worth seeing.

33:33.177 --> 33:35.721
Sir CIifton SincIair,
our very own insurance man,

33:35.763 --> 33:38.765
making a rare trip down
from his ivory tower at Kings Row.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.727
No doubt Iosing sIeep over our
somewhat top-heavy inventory.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.979
Oh, l don't think Sinclair's
the type to Iose sIeep.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.939
lt's rather unnerving
to consider a man

33:45.982 --> 33:49.026
with that history as London Diamond's
greatest guarantor.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.988
Ooh, you didn't know.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.532
He was mixed up in all those
insurance scandaIs

33:55.575 --> 33:57.534
before the National Health Service.

33:57.577 --> 34:01.329
But of course he's completely innocent
or he was never prosecuted.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.665
Otherwise we wouldn't
do business together.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.835
Allow me to present
VIadimir Dmitriev,

34:06.878 --> 34:10.297
head of the Soviet
Diamond Authority.

34:10.339 --> 34:12.215
Mr. Jameson,
my second in command.

34:12.257 --> 34:13.800
How do you do?

34:13.842 --> 34:17.596
And Miss Laura Quinn,
one of our brightest gems.

34:17.638 --> 34:19.222
( speaking Russian )

34:25.480 --> 34:27.773
Ballet, vodka, diamonds--

34:27.815 --> 34:30.025
the three things closest
to the Russian soul.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.359
And which do you prefer?

34:31.402 --> 34:32.860
Diamonds, of course.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.362
l'll drink to that.

34:40.578 --> 34:43.455
My Lord!

34:43.498 --> 34:46.750
And what would you have done
had I said baIIet?

34:46.793 --> 34:48.335
l would ask you to dance.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.139
Of course, l have
ulterior motives.

35:01.182 --> 35:04.518
And, um, what makes
you think l don't?

35:04.560 --> 35:06.353
l shall miss her.

35:15.154 --> 35:17.114
How's the old man bearing up?

35:17.156 --> 35:19.157
Oh, l expect
he'll outlive us all.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.701
Well, l only ask because
l should think hoarding

35:21.744 --> 35:26.289
basically a worthless commodity
would be very bad for his heart.

35:30.294 --> 35:31.962
What am l doing?

35:35.633 --> 35:38.885
l ask myself that repeatedly.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.596
I'm sorry.
l didn't see you.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.598
Purely by design.

35:43.641 --> 35:46.810
You've stumbled into my lair,
my sanctuary of sorts.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.146
Yes, l think l know
what you mean.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.607
At least the evening
is a success.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.943
Your father's spared
no expense.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.571
Never does,
always first class--

35:57.613 --> 36:00.615
so Iong as it's discreet
and doesn't attract attention.

36:00.658 --> 36:04.619
Yes, he's famous
for his discretion.

36:04.662 --> 36:07.789
ls it true he paid £100
to the famiIies

36:07.832 --> 36:09.791
of the miners
who died in protest?

36:11.127 --> 36:13.545
Anonymously.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.131
Bought the bullets
and the caskets.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.467
Should be a discount for that.

36:20.803 --> 36:22.804
What sort of man
does such a thing?

36:24.640 --> 36:27.309
A man of conscience?

39:23.069 --> 39:25.028
Quinn:
Mr. Hobbs?

39:26.197 --> 39:29.532
I'm having troubIe
with the heat in my office.

39:29.575 --> 39:32.327
Uh, Miss Quinn,
do you want

39:32.370 --> 39:36.414
more or less heat
in your office?

39:36.457 --> 39:40.668
If we do this, I want
to know every last detail.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.128
Understand?

39:43.631 --> 39:45.131
Okay.

40:11.575 --> 40:14.494
Now if you just lock
it off under there.

40:35.474 --> 40:37.142
We have to call it off.

40:37.184 --> 40:39.894
They've installed
security cameras,

40:39.937 --> 40:42.689
closed-circuit television
monitoring everything.

40:42.731 --> 40:45.483
l've been with them all morning
showing interest.

40:45.526 --> 40:49.195
- Cameras in the buiIding?
- Yes, inside, outside, halls, lobby.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.322
- ln the vault?
- No, but the vault corridor.

40:51.365 --> 40:54.409
They don't want security guards staring
at mounds of diamonds all day.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.869
Can you blame them?

40:55.911 --> 40:59.122
Oh, security cameras, goodness gracious.
What wiII they think of next?

40:59.165 --> 41:01.916
- ls there any way around them?
- No, absoIuteIy not.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.335
- No?
- There are eight separate cameras

41:04.378 --> 41:06.337
covering the entire sub-basement,

41:06.380 --> 41:09.424
including one dedicated
to the vauIt corridor.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.426
The cameras link
to the guard station,

41:11.469 --> 41:15.638
and Eaton has a man on watch
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.308
Basement's here.

41:18.350 --> 41:20.894
We've got reception,
the boardroom, the corridor.

41:20.936 --> 41:23.771
So you'll just have to reconsider
that pension of yours.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.107
So it's foolproof, eh?

41:26.150 --> 41:29.360
And you came all the way
over to the wrong side

41:29.403 --> 41:30.904
of town to tell me...

41:32.156 --> 41:33.990
when you could've
toId me tonight.

41:35.326 --> 41:37.118
You've seen a way,
haven't you?

41:37.161 --> 41:38.953
l have not, Mr. Hobbs.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.664
Your tenacity
reminds me of my wife.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.294
Why are you being
so persistent?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.963
Because I hate
English winters.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.176
Now tell me how
it can be done.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.305
All right.
There's one possibility,

41:57.348 --> 41:59.474
but l'm telling you,
it won't work.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.935
Although there are eight cameras
in the sub-basement,

42:01.977 --> 42:05.647
only four images are on screen
at any one time-- four on and four off.

42:05.689 --> 42:08.107
And since the images cycle
in 15-second intervaIs,

42:08.150 --> 42:10.151
they reappear
in the order they leave.

42:10.194 --> 42:13.112
- So each image is off-screen for...
- 60 seconds, yeah?

42:13.155 --> 42:15.615
Yeah, 60 seconds,
but that's not enough time.

42:15.658 --> 42:18.159
Enough time? l'll be in that vault
in 10 seconds flat.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.994
You can't be standing
outside the vault

42:20.037 --> 42:23.164
when the image goes off screen and be
nowhere in sight when it reappears.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.166
You have to start
at the end of the corridor,

42:25.209 --> 42:26.626
and that's 40 yards long.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.462
Well, l don't have
a problem with that.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.297
With all due respect, Mr. Hobbs,

42:31.340 --> 42:33.466
you can hardly walk,
Iet aIone run.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.802
l'm telling you l can do it.

42:38.889 --> 42:41.307
This has gone too far.

42:41.350 --> 42:43.059
l'm sorry.

42:43.102 --> 42:47.480
You're invoIved now,
whether you like it or not.

42:47.523 --> 42:48.856
l beg your pardon.

42:48.899 --> 42:52.318
You gave me the code,
Miss Quinn, so you're involved.

42:52.361 --> 42:54.571
Make no mistake,

42:54.613 --> 42:55.989
l'm going through with this.

42:56.031 --> 42:58.700
And don't you pretend
to me that you don't want it

42:58.742 --> 43:00.702
because you want it
more than l do.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.663
You want a life that means
something and adds up.

43:03.706 --> 43:07.834
And you know that this is
the only way you're going to get it.

43:07.876 --> 43:11.921
Miss Quinn, you said it yourself,

43:11.964 --> 43:13.756
they're never going to notice it.

43:18.596 --> 43:20.138
This is how it'll work.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.724
Tomorrow we'll
synchronize our watches,

43:22.766 --> 43:26.394
but it has to be tomorrow before
they realize the flaw in the system.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.105
At the exact moment
you're at the vault corridor,

43:29.148 --> 43:30.732
l'll call the guard station.

43:30.774 --> 43:33.735
That should buy you
at least 30 more seconds.

43:35.487 --> 43:38.948
When this is over,
l think best we not speak again.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.776
Evening, Miss Quinn.

44:14.818 --> 44:21.157
Evening, Henry.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.076
Albert.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.497
Evening, Miss Quinn.
May I?

44:30.084 --> 44:33.336
- What's the word, Henry?
- Ask me again on Friday.

44:43.931 --> 44:46.182
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

48:34.036 --> 48:42.168
Ah!

49:00.812 --> 49:02.480
Damn it.

49:55.617 --> 49:57.618
( ringing )

50:15.595 --> 50:17.179
Lewis. Hello.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.348
Hello?

51:46.561 --> 51:48.562
( chatting )

52:07.499 --> 52:09.917
( whispering )

52:20.554 --> 52:21.846
Henry: Hobbs!

52:26.601 --> 52:29.770
I'm afraid there's a probIem.
lf you wouldn't mind coming back in?

52:30.897 --> 52:32.982
Open up!

52:41.616 --> 52:43.242
The, uh...

52:43.285 --> 52:44.702
Mr. Lewis, l'm afraid.

52:44.744 --> 52:46.787
God knows what
that man ingests.

52:49.374 --> 52:50.791
Would you mind?

52:52.294 --> 52:54.128
l'll, uh, leave you to it.

53:06.099 --> 53:08.184
- Mr. Hobbs.
- Morning, Miss Quinn.

53:09.436 --> 53:11.562
How are things
this morning, Henry?

53:11.605 --> 53:14.607
ln a word, dull.

54:23.510 --> 54:28.055
- lsn't there a sight next week?
- Fifth Monday.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.516
That's very odd.
The sorters have gone home.

54:30.558 --> 54:32.726
( telephone ringing )

54:32.769 --> 54:35.854
- ls he here yet? MKA-- is he here yet?
- No, sir.

54:35.897 --> 54:39.233
Mr. Jameson, what happened?
What is so important?

54:52.080 --> 54:55.040
- ( pounds on door )
- Eaton: Miss Quinn?

54:55.083 --> 54:56.417
( pounds )

54:56.459 --> 54:58.460
Miss Quinn, you in there?

55:01.423 --> 55:04.758
l need not remind you we're all bound
by the strictest confidentiaIity.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.219
Under no circumstances
will you discuss the incident.

55:07.262 --> 55:10.222
Any act to the contrary will result
in the severest consequences.

55:10.265 --> 55:12.599
- ls that clear?
- Yes, of course.

56:03.651 --> 56:06.445
The eIevator's
the single point of entry,

56:06.488 --> 56:08.864
no underground tunnels,

56:08.907 --> 56:11.658
three narrow ventilation ducts,
aII of which Iead nowhere.

56:11.701 --> 56:14.161
The entire sub-basement
is encased in concrete,

56:14.204 --> 56:16.955
marble and an outer casing
of solid steel.

56:16.998 --> 56:19.958
This has to be the most secure
facility in all of Europe.

56:20.001 --> 56:22.711
That's certainIy
what we believed.

56:22.754 --> 56:25.381
Besides which there were
nearly two tons of diamonds.

56:25.423 --> 56:28.425
You would need an army
of men and several vehicles.

56:37.268 --> 56:39.812
Sir Milton: Now you all know
Sir CIifton SincIair,

56:39.854 --> 56:42.314
from Kings Row,
our underwriters.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.025
Well, we've talked it through
and we have agreed

56:45.068 --> 56:48.445
that our utmost priority must be
the appearance of business as usual.

56:48.488 --> 56:51.573
ln any police investigation

56:51.616 --> 56:54.910
the subsequent publicity
would be a disaster,

56:54.953 --> 56:57.663
just like that
all confidence gone.

56:57.705 --> 57:00.332
So we handle
the matter privately.

57:00.375 --> 57:02.376
Sinclair.

57:02.419 --> 57:04.711
As you aII know
Kings Row have been behind

57:04.754 --> 57:07.589
London Diamond
for the last 70 years.

57:07.632 --> 57:09.466
And today is no exception.

57:09.509 --> 57:12.344
With that in mind, l'd like to introduce
you to Sir Gavin Finch,

57:12.387 --> 57:14.972
our chief insurance investigator.
Mr. Finch.

57:16.099 --> 57:20.310
Good morning, everyone.
Please, there is no need to panic.

57:20.353 --> 57:22.104
We will find your diamonds.

57:22.147 --> 57:25.107
No need to panic? The world's supply
of diamonds have vanished

57:25.150 --> 57:27.526
into thin air and there's
no need to panic?

57:27.569 --> 57:29.194
l will see inside the vault now

57:29.237 --> 57:32.197
and if the night staff could be
caIIed back? Thank you.

57:47.797 --> 57:49.882
What have you done?

57:49.924 --> 57:52.050
lt's all in hand,
Miss Quinn.

57:52.093 --> 57:54.136
ln hand?
ln hand?

57:54.179 --> 57:56.221
The contents
of a thermos, you said.

57:56.264 --> 58:00.225
When you're finished, meet me at
the café at the corner of Hatton Ground.

58:00.268 --> 58:02.603
Mr. Hobbs.

58:02.645 --> 58:03.770
Yes.

58:03.813 --> 58:05.689
This way, please.

58:36.429 --> 58:38.680
Not one of your
better ideas, Miss Quinn.

58:38.723 --> 58:40.432
l suggest we cut this short.

58:40.475 --> 58:42.392
What have you
done with the diamonds?

58:42.435 --> 58:44.102
I want answers
and l want them now.

58:44.145 --> 58:46.063
You're gonna get them
all in good time.

58:46.105 --> 58:49.233
- Oh my God!
- l insist that you remain calm.

58:49.275 --> 58:50.567
What did you say to Finch?

58:50.610 --> 58:53.445
I toId him I went
on shift as normal.

58:53.488 --> 58:55.113
l waxed the floors
for a whiIe.

58:55.156 --> 58:58.242
l emptied the rubbish--
a normal night.

58:58.284 --> 59:00.118
l-l lied.

59:00.161 --> 59:03.121
I want you to go back to work,
do exactly what we discussed,

59:03.164 --> 59:06.917
keep to your routine
and we'll talk again. Okay?

59:06.960 --> 59:09.545
This is where
l'll be tomorrow.

59:18.846 --> 59:22.474
Miss Quinn? Sir Milton's office
is asking for you urgentIy.

59:27.730 --> 59:30.148
Man: Should you elect
to purchase the goods

59:30.191 --> 59:32.818
you must notify me
by week's end.

59:32.860 --> 59:35.696
lt's my understanding
that specifics

59:35.738 --> 59:38.448
as to the inventory
and the purchase terms

59:38.491 --> 59:41.243
are explicitly set forth
in this letter.

59:46.749 --> 59:49.001
ImportantIy,
l'm not to be made privy

59:49.043 --> 59:51.628
to any arrangement between
my client and yourself.

59:51.671 --> 59:54.172
You are simply to alert me
to your intentions

59:54.215 --> 59:56.300
at which point I wiII
provide instructions

59:56.342 --> 59:59.052
regarding method of payment.

59:59.095 --> 01:00:03.098
My client will then convey where you
may take possession of the goods.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:05.809
Mr. Boyle, are we to understand

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:09.354
the identity of your client
is unknown to you?

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:12.816
- That's correct.
- As is the nature of this inventory?

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.068
- Also correct.
- ( door opens )

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:19.823
Excuse me, but there's a call
for Mr. Boyle from his office.

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:27.623
What in the name
of God is all this?

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:39.426
"Now available, a selection
of uncut diamonds,

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:43.263
market price:
£100 million sterling."

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:46.683
ls that it?
ls that all it says?

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.769
"Payable within 48 hours."

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.729
We've been hijacked by madmen!

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.898
Shouldn't this man be detained?

01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.901
l'm afraid Mr. Boyle has
toId us aII he knows.

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.114
Pardon the interruption.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.329
ls there anything further?

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:13.669
l will await your call.

01:01:13.711 --> 01:01:15.128
Good day.

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.823
The South African Star.

01:01:44.283 --> 01:01:45.283
( buzzes )

01:01:45.326 --> 01:01:48.829
Get Sinclair back. Now!

01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:55.919
( knock on door )

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:59.172
Ah, Miss Quinn, may l?

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:01.091
l'm working my way
through personnel.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:04.136
- Yes, please.
- Thank you.

01:02:04.178 --> 01:02:06.680
Take a seat.

01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:23.572
Would you care
for a cigarette?

01:02:23.614 --> 01:02:25.198
No, thank you.

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:35.125
Thank you.

01:02:37.587 --> 01:02:40.797
Now... Miss Quinn...

01:02:43.634 --> 01:02:46.762
you're American, but you
were educated at Oxford.

01:02:46.804 --> 01:02:48.847
You have been working
here for 15 years

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.807
and you are now
a senior negotiator.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:52.893
That's right.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.187
Would you say you have
done well for yourself?

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:57.814
Yes.

01:03:01.652 --> 01:03:04.571
- Not married?
- No.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.283
And you are 38?

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:11.661
That's right, Mr. Finch.

01:03:11.704 --> 01:03:13.872
l certainly hope
that's not a crime.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.587
- Do you have any leads?
- Ahem.

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:26.551
Now in your professional
capacity, Miss Quinn,

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:29.095
who would you say were
London Diamond's enemies?

01:03:30.264 --> 01:03:32.516
lt's potentially a long list.

01:03:32.558 --> 01:03:34.434
We are a major global business.

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:38.563
Why do you think there could be
more to this than money?

01:03:38.606 --> 01:03:41.900
The diamond that
Mr. Boyle has left, the...

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.069
The Kimberly 4.

01:03:44.111 --> 01:03:48.281
530 carats, the fourth largest
cut diamond in the worId.

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.075
lf they were motivated by money,

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:52.536
it's unlikely it would still
be in our possession.

01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:56.706
Are you saying it's symbolic?

01:03:56.749 --> 01:04:00.126
lt's also known
as the South African Star.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:05.048
Thank you, Miss Quinn.
That'II be aII for now.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:12.973
Oh, uh...

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:15.058
that Mr. Hobbs,

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.852
you're on good terms
with him?

01:04:16.894 --> 01:04:19.312
I suppose so.
He's one of the night janitors.

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.565
Always seems quite jovial.

01:04:21.607 --> 01:04:24.109
You were speaking to him
today in the corridor.

01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.903
Yes, l've been having
problems with my radiator.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.072
l asked him if he could
come and Iook at it.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.950
lt's erratic--
temperaturewise.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:33.994
And did he manage
to solve the problem?

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:38.081
I beIieve he was going to try
and find some time this week.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.625
Good.
Thank you again, Miss Quinn.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:56.933
Thank you, gentlemen,
for the instruction.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.102
l'll get back
to you in 24 hours.

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:03.148
Gentlemen, thank you.

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:11.072
- Good morning.
- Miss Quinn, good morning.

01:05:11.115 --> 01:05:13.116
You seem bright
and breezy this morning.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.118
l'd like to be given
authority to liaise

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:17.162
with Mr. Finch
on the investigation.

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:19.164
- Why?
- With the time pressure we're under

01:05:19.206 --> 01:05:22.542
we aII need to be communicating
as efficiently as we're able. And...

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.044
And?

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:27.964
- Finch was hired by Sinclair.
- WeII, I don't see why not.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:31.051
There's a whole explosion
of nothing downstairs.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.261
l see the Kings Row
Iawyers are back.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:36.014
Surely they're not prepared to pay
the ransom on our behaIf?

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.058
Not if Sinclair has
anything to do with it.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.061
He's aIready Iobbied the other
members of the syndicate against

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:44.064
settling the claim, saying the, uh,
the deadlines are unreasonable.

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:47.275
But of course he would, wouldn't he?
He's the majority shareholder.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:50.487
His life would return to zero,
where he started.

01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:53.949
- They're not bound by contract?
- Miss Quinn, as l'm sure you're aware,

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:56.159
where large personal
fortunes are concerned,

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.037
contracts have a habit
of developing loopholes.

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:03.083
And if that happened,
then we're insoIvent.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:07.420
No diamonds. No sight.
The worId knows.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:10.048
All hell breaks loose.

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.342
You'll speak to Mr. Finch?

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:15.053
Tell him that
l'll be assisting.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.888
lt's our official
company position.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:20.058
Well, you seem terribly keen.

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.227
Well, my job is at stake.

01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:24.229
All of ours are.

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:26.773
AII right.
l'll speak to him right now.

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:41.621
This has just come
through, Mr. Finch.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:51.589
- Miss Quinn.
- Mr. Jameson may have spoken to you.

01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:54.134
Uh, l'm to assist you

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:56.928
in any way l can
with the investigation.

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.556
Yes, he told me.

01:06:59.598 --> 01:07:01.474
I'm going down
to the vault now.

01:07:03.060 --> 01:07:05.645
- Oh, these monitors?
- The new security system.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.605
Well, actually, not very secure.

01:07:07.648 --> 01:07:09.941
Every 60 seconds
each corridor

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:12.485
is left totally unobserved
for one fuII minute.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.697
Well, one minute,
that's not very much time.

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:18.074
Time enough
to pass undetected.

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:26.541
The Iift is
the single point of entry.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:29.711
But the diamonds were not
removed by way of the lift.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:32.088
Each activation is recorded,

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.591
prompting an electronic
time stamp.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:39.763
As usuaI, there were
three trips that night.

01:07:39.805 --> 01:07:43.224
ln each instance the lift returned
at once to the main level.

01:07:43.267 --> 01:07:45.560
So the lift was never
stationary long enough

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:48.063
in the sub-basement to load
the contents of the vault.

01:07:48.105 --> 01:07:50.648
That's right.
You may need these.

01:07:50.691 --> 01:07:52.734
( construction noise )

01:07:59.867 --> 01:08:01.284
Excuse me.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:05.914
Steel, three inches thick,

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:08.666
floor, ceiling, walls.

01:08:08.709 --> 01:08:12.504
But to get the diamonds out they must
have penetrated it somewhere.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:15.882
- Finch: No forced entry.
- They knew the combination.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:19.385
So, all things
considered, Mr. Finch,

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.554
what conclusions
have you arrived at?

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:24.808
lsn't it obvious what conclusions
I've arrived at, Miss Quinn?

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.019
A woman of your intelligence
must sureIy have guessed.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:33.733
2:00, l believe
we're expected upstairs.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:57.590
A stopgap to restore diamond
inventories to an acceptable level.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:01.719
£5 million,

01:09:01.761 --> 01:09:03.555
that is what you've
come up with, eh?

01:09:03.596 --> 01:09:05.390
Fencing the stones
is impossible.

01:09:05.432 --> 01:09:08.350
You control all the major trading
centers across the pIanet.

01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:11.729
When the first diamond turns up,
within hours you'll get the rest.

01:09:11.772 --> 01:09:16.109
Sinclair, we are the sole supplier
of diamonds to six continents.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:19.904
Any hint we can no longer
supply would be catastrophic.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:22.991
Money is no substitute
for diamonds.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.118
Miss Quinn is here
with Mr. Finch, sir.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:27.745
Paying the ransom won't
guarantee your diamonds back

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:31.207
and wiII make it more difficuIt
to apprehend those responsible.

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.377
That is your problem, not mine.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.380
Ah, Mr. Finch. I beIieve
Mr. Finch has got something

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:41.134
to tell us which may alter
all our perspectives.

01:09:42.303 --> 01:09:44.554
l am now in no doubt that
the crime was perpetrated

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:47.807
by either one or a number
of London Diamond employees.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.144
l believe also that the perpetrator
obtained the codes to the vault

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:54.898
from Sir Milton's residence, most likely
Iast Saturday evening during a party.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:58.067
A team has been sent over
to the house to dust for prints.

01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:02.780
Mr. Finch, you said that you deemed the
motive for the robbery to be poIiticaI.

01:10:02.823 --> 01:10:06.576
Were it crime for profit, a single
handful of diamonds would do.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:10.914
Now, Mr. Finch, in your opinion, who are
the most IikeIy poIiticaI factions?

01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:13.791
The Soviets and the South African
rebels would top the list.

01:10:13.834 --> 01:10:16.461
And are there any
members of personnel

01:10:16.503 --> 01:10:18.796
in London Diamond
who might be associated

01:10:18.839 --> 01:10:22.342
with, uh, these
political factions?

01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:26.638
Well, there was one name
that came to the surface.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.806
Ahem.

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:32.977
OIiver Ashtoncroft,
age 20, arrested at Oxford

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:36.439
whilst attending
a Marxist Leninist rally.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:39.359
This is ridicuIous.
That was nearly two decades ago.

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:42.153
Just because I don't advocate
everything that goes on at this company

01:10:42.196 --> 01:10:44.197
does not make me
a communist or a thief.

01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:45.823
That is enough!

01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:51.162
You really have sunk
to the dregs this time, eh?

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:54.165
WeII, I'm sorry,
but unless we can remove

01:10:54.208 --> 01:10:56.334
even the slightest hint of fraud,

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:59.462
Kings Row will not even
consider full settlement.

01:10:59.505 --> 01:11:03.967
Sinclair, as the syndicate's
largest underwriter

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:07.553
you stand to lose a great deal
of your ill-gotten fortune.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.973
Or do l overstate?

01:11:10.015 --> 01:11:12.141
lll-gotten?
Well, now that is rich,

01:11:12.184 --> 01:11:16.145
coming from a de facto dictator
of an entire slave nation.

01:11:16.188 --> 01:11:18.273
For 30 years we have paid you

01:11:18.315 --> 01:11:22.193
inordinate sums of money
for your security.

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.070
We have done so
in the hope that one day

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:30.326
Well, that day has come,
SincIair, and what, eh?

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:33.621
Nothing?
l will crush you, Sinclair.

01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:36.582
l will take everything you have

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:39.836
and then l will piss
on your fucking grave.

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:55.893
How'd you do it, Mr. Hobbs?
How'd you get them out?

01:11:55.936 --> 01:11:57.937
Do you know what the hardest
substance in the worId is?

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.773
- And who's really behind this?
- The diamond.

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:02.900
You rub it with a cloth,
it Iets off a charge.

01:12:02.943 --> 01:12:05.403
You put it in water,
it comes up dry.

01:12:05.446 --> 01:12:07.697
Its onIy enemy
is another diamond.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.074
You do know you've rendered
the stones worthIess?

01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:12.660
All of them.
They can't be sold.

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:14.912
London Diamond's
the only buyer on earth.

01:12:14.955 --> 01:12:18.249
Precisely. And to that end,
we have demanded a ransom.

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:20.043
We? No, there is no "we."

01:12:20.085 --> 01:12:23.087
They won't pay.
They couldn't if they wanted.

01:12:23.130 --> 01:12:24.756
There's no money.

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:27.383
And that investigator Finch,
he saw us taIking.

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:30.053
He wiII find out,
l have absolutely no doubt.

01:12:30.095 --> 01:12:32.764
Have you ever thought
about your plans, like?

01:12:32.806 --> 01:12:34.599
No, l mean,
when you get your share,

01:12:34.641 --> 01:12:36.476
what are you gonna
do with your life?

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:39.270
l mean, are you gonna
be a giver or a taker?

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.606
Oh, you stupid old man!

01:12:41.648 --> 01:12:44.609
Wake up!
Don't you understand

01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:48.112
that the only life for us
is one behind bars?

01:12:48.155 --> 01:12:51.115
Okay, look.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:53.534
l can negotiate
our way out of this.

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:55.912
I'II go to Ashtoncroft,
offer him the diamonds

01:12:55.954 --> 01:12:58.164
in exchange for our freedom
and our siIence.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:01.959
He'll-- he'll accept the deal.
His terror of publicity will see to it.

01:13:02.002 --> 01:13:04.587
All you have to do is tell me
where the diamonds are.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:06.255
l'm-- l'm sorry, Miss Quinn.

01:13:06.298 --> 01:13:09.967
l-- l'd like to help, but l do
not intend to negotiate.

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:13.179
Well, then l have no option
but to turn myself in.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.640
Oh, really? ls that what
you're gonna do, eh?

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:17.975
After aII these years
clawing your way up,

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:20.395
laughing at men's jokes,

01:13:20.437 --> 01:13:24.440
subservient, neglecting
your opportunities,

01:13:24.483 --> 01:13:26.234
giving up on love,

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:28.820
no time for the simple,
the decent,

01:13:28.862 --> 01:13:30.530
doing all the dirty work--

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:33.825
you're really going to throw
all that away just to spite me?

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.745
l require the money in full.

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:40.081
And yes, they can pay it.

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:43.418
It is preciseIy what
they are insured for.

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:46.295
As you wish. Then l shall
find the diamonds myself.

01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:48.297
- Oh, is that a fact?
- Oh, it certainIy is.

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.967
I shaII find the diamonds,
make no mistake about it.

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:07.066
- ls this a bad time?
- No no, not at aII.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.485
lt's just a formality,
you understand?

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:12.530
And we have requested
the same from all employees

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:15.032
who were present
at Sir Milton's party.

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:16.617
A set of fingerprints?

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.077
Of course.

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:20.621
May l?

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:22.915
There's reaIIy
nothing to worry about.

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:26.252
lt's simply to rule you out conclusively
from our investigations.

01:14:29.423 --> 01:14:31.257
Sorry, it's quite warm in here.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.717
lsn't it?

01:14:32.759 --> 01:14:34.594
Now if you'll allow me.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:42.560
Are you really considering Ollie
to be your prime suspect?

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.228
What? Mmm.

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:49.066
Wouldn't you say he had the greatest
facility to obtain the codes?

01:14:49.109 --> 01:14:51.569
But does he have the courage?

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:55.907
The requisite spine
of ambition?

01:14:55.949 --> 01:14:59.410
lt's hard to imagine anyone capable
of so audacious a crime.

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:02.997
Audacious orjust ambitious?

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:07.627
Ambition is something you
understand, Miss Quinn.

01:15:10.088 --> 01:15:13.049
No longer married, Mr. Finch?

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.221
No, l'm not.

01:15:18.263 --> 01:15:21.057
She tire of all
your investigating?

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:23.392
Yes, she did.

01:15:23.435 --> 01:15:25.603
l'm sorry.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.443
Here.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:38.074
Thank you.

01:15:38.116 --> 01:15:42.745
Oh, and just one
last thing, Miss Quinn--

01:15:42.788 --> 01:15:44.747
l need your assistance
downstairs.

01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:47.208
CouId you? It's just
a matter of a few minutes.

01:15:47.251 --> 01:15:48.626
Certainly.

01:15:53.298 --> 01:15:57.468
Now l want you to tell me
in your opinion, Miss Quinn,

01:15:57.511 --> 01:15:59.971
if this man is lying.

01:16:04.851 --> 01:16:07.728
Mr. Hobbs, I beIieve
you know Miss Quinn.

01:16:07.771 --> 01:16:11.649
Uh, third floor, second office
from the lift, yes.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:14.110
She's been kind enough to act
as my second set of ears.

01:16:15.237 --> 01:16:17.655
Uh, are we still discussing
Tuesday night, sir?

01:16:20.617 --> 01:16:23.452
l would like to revisit
the period

01:16:23.495 --> 01:16:25.830
in the sub-basement

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:28.874
from 3:00-6:00 AM--

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:30.376
three hours,

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:33.713
the bulk of which
is unaccounted for.

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:37.883
The nature of my job, sir,
is somewhat solitary.

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.719
Now you stated earlier

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:43.681
these hours were spent
waxing and polishing floors.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:44.849
Yeah, mostly. Yeah.

01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:47.393
That's a great deaI of time
devoted to polishing floors.

01:16:47.436 --> 01:16:49.395
Well, marble is
very particular, sir.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:52.898
lt requires a certain type of polish
and a lot of time to set.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.861
At what time did you tend
to the vauIt corridor?

01:16:56.903 --> 01:16:58.237
At the very end.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.407
- Between 5:00 and 6:00 AM?
- Yes.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:04.327
Why then?
Why wait until the end?

01:17:04.369 --> 01:17:06.662
Oh, it's-- it's a cherished task.

01:17:06.705 --> 01:17:10.833
It's akin to tending
the palace throne, l imagine.

01:17:12.085 --> 01:17:13.919
l always save the best till last.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.087
Hmm.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:19.300
Any hobbies, Mr. Hobbs,

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:20.801
leisure-time activities?

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.554
Yes, l-- l read a good book
now and then.

01:17:23.597 --> 01:17:24.889
Anything in particular?

01:17:24.931 --> 01:17:27.892
Graham Greene, uh, HG Wells,

01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:30.478
sometimes Emily Dickinson.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.063
Nothing more radical?

01:17:32.105 --> 01:17:35.900
No Soviet literature
in your collection, Mr. Hobbs?

01:17:35.942 --> 01:17:39.111
Oh, l-l tried "War and Peace,"
but I couIdn't finish it.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:43.407
You frequent greyhound races.

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.243
You like to watch dogs
run around in circles?

01:17:46.286 --> 01:17:48.913
And I aIso wash
my smalls on Thursdays,

01:17:48.955 --> 01:17:51.374
if you're interested.

01:17:53.126 --> 01:17:57.797
Now I see your wife died
some years back of cancer.

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.257
- Her name was...
- Margaret.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.761
That's right. lt must have been
excruciating for you--

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:06.639
sitting by, watching her
wither away,

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.849
taken in the very prime of life.

01:18:08.892 --> 01:18:12.687
Mr. Finch, you sound like a man
who's Iost something.

01:18:12.729 --> 01:18:16.107
Perhaps if you were to teII me
what it was, l could help you locate it.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.403
- Mr. Finch?
- Yes?

01:18:20.445 --> 01:18:23.239
We have something
that may be of interest.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.368
( recorder clicks )

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:28.786
Excuse me.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.624
( men whispering )

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:39.296
That'll be all
for now, Mr. Hobbs.

01:18:39.339 --> 01:18:41.757
l will see you later,
Miss Quinn.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:50.266
ln Ashtoncroft's study
l used a handkerchief,

01:18:50.308 --> 01:18:52.893
but in the heat of the moment
I may have Ieft a fingerprint.

01:18:52.936 --> 01:18:56.147
l know why you did this.
l know it's not about the money.

01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:58.691
Nothing important ever is.

01:18:59.943 --> 01:19:02.403
l understand you have
poIiticaI convictions,

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:06.407
but you have to know Kings Row
is trying every tactic not to pay.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:08.826
And l have a feeling
they're going to succeed.

01:19:08.869 --> 01:19:11.996
Our only way out of this
is to negotiate.

01:19:12.038 --> 01:19:14.790
They never found
the diamonds then.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:19.336
You'll get nothing, absolutely nothing,
just a lifetime in jail.

01:19:19.379 --> 01:19:21.505
Is this cause
of yours worth it?

01:19:21.548 --> 01:19:23.716
l mean, would the cause
do the same for you?

01:19:25.051 --> 01:19:27.678
This time tomorrow morning
this will all be over.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:31.515
What's that old phrase about
two wrongs a right do not make?

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.017
That's nonsense.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:35.019
Sometimes to make
something right

01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:38.063
you have to do
something just as wrong.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:42.193
Oh-- oh, yes, my cause.

01:19:42.235 --> 01:19:44.487
lt's worth 100 lifetimes

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:48.365
in jail for me, Miss Quinn.

01:19:48.408 --> 01:19:50.701
Someday you will understand.

01:19:50.744 --> 01:19:53.078
Maybe it will inspire you

01:19:53.121 --> 01:19:56.040
to Iook beyond
these marble walls.

01:19:56.082 --> 01:19:58.083
There's a remarkable
world out there.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.214
Oh, and if it's
any consolation,

01:20:03.256 --> 01:20:06.258
I never reaIIy
intended to involve you.

01:20:12.265 --> 01:20:14.266
( thundering )

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:30.741
Get the forensic
department to verify it.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.076
Yes, sir.

01:20:32.118 --> 01:20:33.661
What about the dog track?
Anything?

01:20:33.703 --> 01:20:34.954
Yes, um...

01:20:36.748 --> 01:20:38.040
this one here.

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:42.127
l'm pretty certain that's him, sir--
the janitor.

01:21:19.457 --> 01:21:20.875
Christ, Hobbs!

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.835
How did you do it?

01:21:24.462 --> 01:21:27.214
I'm teIIing you,
we have no more time.

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.884
Taking on Ashtoncroft
when his back is to the wall

01:21:29.926 --> 01:21:33.846
wiII Iead to a bIood-bath.
Someone's going to be ruined.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:36.724
- And what about Finch?
- He says he has some leads.

01:21:36.766 --> 01:21:38.934
l don't think we can rely on him.

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:40.811
We don't have any choice.

01:21:40.854 --> 01:21:44.148
Make sure that he comes up
with something and quickly.

01:21:45.483 --> 01:21:49.153
What the hell do you think
l have been doing?

01:21:54.993 --> 01:21:56.952
Contact the syndicate members,

01:21:56.995 --> 01:21:58.787
all of them.

01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:00.789
Convene a meeting tonight.

01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:02.750
And tell them what?

01:22:03.835 --> 01:22:05.586
Tell them...

01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:08.255
tell them...

01:22:09.674 --> 01:22:11.383
tell them if
they do not come here

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:13.969
with their wallets open
to pay me everything

01:22:14.012 --> 01:22:18.307
they owe me, l will dedicate
my remaining years

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.267
on this earth

01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:23.604
to ruining
every last one of them.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:28.776
Tell them that,

01:22:28.818 --> 01:22:30.110
word for word.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.120
( thunder rumbling )

01:22:54.135 --> 01:22:56.303
( telephone rings )

01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:59.431
Woman:
"London Evening News."

01:22:59.474 --> 01:23:01.475
Put me through
to the news desk, please.

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:11.402
l was looking for you.

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:14.697
I need some air.
Will you have a drink with me?

01:23:22.455 --> 01:23:24.790
( jazz music playing )

01:23:36.636 --> 01:23:39.763
You know you're quite
someone, Miss Quinn.

01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:41.765
A true maverick.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:45.769
Why was it again
no one married you?

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:49.898
My mother said, "Beating the boys
won't make you popular or happy."

01:23:49.941 --> 01:23:51.442
lt turns out she was right.

01:23:54.154 --> 01:23:58.115
We're the same, you and l--
outsiders, Ioners.

01:23:58.158 --> 01:24:01.618
We could almost be brilliant.

01:24:01.661 --> 01:24:04.496
But what would we achieve
with all the hours we put in?

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:07.124
Absolutely nothing.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:13.839
Man:
Anything else, sir?

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:15.507
- ( knock on door )
- Come in.

01:24:16.509 --> 01:24:18.635
Sir, the press
are outside.

01:24:18.678 --> 01:24:20.679
The press?
What do they want?

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.514
l'm not sure, sir.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:25.017
l'll speak to them.

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.861
( reporters clamoring )

01:24:38.364 --> 01:24:41.575
Ladies and gentlemen,
ladies and gentlemen, please.

01:24:41.618 --> 01:24:44.953
Sir MiIton Ashtoncroft is
not available at the moment.

01:24:46.539 --> 01:24:48.707
( reporters yelling )
Sir Milton! Sir Milton!

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:13.857
So, Miss Quinn...

01:25:18.738 --> 01:25:22.866
Remove £100 miIIion
of diamonds past cameras,

01:25:22.909 --> 01:25:27.204
walls of steel, security guards
and seaIed doorways?

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.164
For the life of me
I can't unraveI it.

01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:34.128
I wish I couId heIp you,
but l'm really not that clever.

01:25:34.170 --> 01:25:36.839
Maybe you struck a deal
with the Russians. Who knows?

01:25:36.881 --> 01:25:39.091
You couId Iook
after their new cartel

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.051
once Lon Di hits the scrap heap.

01:25:41.094 --> 01:25:43.178
Do l appear so diabolical?

01:25:48.434 --> 01:25:51.728
We've seen a photo of you
at the racetrack with Mr. Hobbs.

01:25:51.771 --> 01:25:53.897
You must be mistaken.
I never gambIe.

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:58.902
We also found some fingerprints
at the Ashtoncroft mansion.

01:25:58.945 --> 01:26:02.406
By midnight we shall
have conclusive results.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:06.785
Oh, and, um...

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:11.623
did you know my fee is 5%
of recovered goods?

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.751
l understand what
you're doing, Mr. Finch.

01:26:14.794 --> 01:26:16.211
You're testing me,

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:19.715
measuring my reactions,
my stimulus responses.

01:26:19.757 --> 01:26:22.759
But the truth is
you haven't arrested me

01:26:22.802 --> 01:26:24.386
because you have no evidence

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:26.263
because l've
committed no crime.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:29.224
Perhaps l haven't arrested you
because l'm waiting for you

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:31.518
to reveal who's
really behind all this.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:36.064
Sir, there's been an incident.

01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:38.150
News of the robbery
has leaked to the press.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:40.235
Mr. Ashtoncroft
has had a heart attack.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:43.238
- Is-- is he aII right?
- l'm afraid not, madam.

01:26:43.281 --> 01:26:45.449
The board are reconvening
back at the office.

01:26:48.953 --> 01:26:51.496
l hope you have no intentions
of leaving town, Miss Quinn.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.383
( sobbing )

01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:27.866
Shit.

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:37.751
Ohh.

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.592
( grunting )

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:50.717
Hobbs:
Aren't you a picture?

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.139
Clever girl, eh?

01:29:56.182 --> 01:29:59.059
Filthy, but clever.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.144
Ashtoncroft's dead,

01:30:01.187 --> 01:30:04.731
or was that aII a part
of your plan, Mr. Hobbs?

01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:07.234
I'm going back
and telling them everything.

01:30:07.276 --> 01:30:09.778
l'm afraid l can't
let you go, Miss Quinn.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:12.489
You see, the deadline
for the ransom's

01:30:12.532 --> 01:30:14.908
in about an hour

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:18.578
and l'm guarding
the entrance to Aladdin's cave

01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:21.706
in case someone's
smart enough to figure it out.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.375
Like you.

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:28.922
You're quite an asset to the company,
aren't you, Miss Quinn?

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:31.883
They're not going to pay
and you're insane to think they would!

01:30:31.926 --> 01:30:33.927
Oh, they wiII,
l'm sure of that.

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:36.805
Ever think what you're going
to do when all of this is over?

01:30:51.404 --> 01:30:53.321
Ugh! Ugh!

01:31:00.997 --> 01:31:04.583
You know, you remind me
so much of my wife.

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:09.754
Once she got her teeth
into something...

01:31:11.924 --> 01:31:14.926
- Did l ever tell you how she died?
- Cancer.

01:31:16.262 --> 01:31:20.557
At first they said that not only
was her cancer operabIe,

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:23.935
but it had been caught earIy
and she had an excellent chance.

01:31:23.978 --> 01:31:27.230
But you see, we'd paid
what little money we had

01:31:27.273 --> 01:31:30.066
into a private hospital policy.

01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:34.237
But then the insurance
company toId her

01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:38.408
that she had to wait her turn
for a stay in hospital.

01:31:38.451 --> 01:31:41.536
So we pIeaded
our case all the way

01:31:41.579 --> 01:31:44.581
up to the chairman
of the company.

01:31:44.624 --> 01:31:47.792
But he said
it wasn't an emergency.

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:51.713
So, you know,

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:56.092
by the time she was
admitted to the hospital,

01:31:56.135 --> 01:31:59.262
well, it-- it was--

01:31:59.305 --> 01:32:01.598
she was too far gone then.

01:32:01.641 --> 01:32:05.602
- lt's Sinclair.
- Yeah.

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:09.231
At that time Clifton Sinclair
was the biggest seIIer

01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:13.902
of private hospitaI poIicies
to the British underprivileged.

01:32:13.945 --> 01:32:16.696
And he used that money
to estabIish himseIf...

01:32:16.739 --> 01:32:20.242
As London Diamond's largest
insurance underwriter.

01:32:20.284 --> 01:32:24.913
lndividual participants
in Kings Row syndicates

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:26.790
are liable

01:32:26.832 --> 01:32:31.169
to the fuII extent
of their private wealth.

01:32:32.296 --> 01:32:34.464
- ( door sIams )
- What is the meaning of this?

01:32:34.507 --> 01:32:36.174
What the heII
are you doing here?

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:39.135
- We've been discussing the situation.
- What situation?

01:32:39.178 --> 01:32:40.762
The impossible situation
that you've got us into.

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.390
- What are you talking about?
- ln case you didn't know, we own

01:32:43.432 --> 01:32:47.018
75% of "The London Evening News."
l believe you spoke with them earlier.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.020
- Yes.
- Going to the press means you don't

01:32:49.063 --> 01:32:50.897
have to come up
with a quick settlement.

01:32:50.940 --> 01:32:54.859
The scandaIous news, your time
is bought, that was the plan, wasn't it?

01:32:54.902 --> 01:32:58.113
Mr. Ashtoncroft has, however,
agreed to dismiss aII charges

01:32:58.155 --> 01:33:01.283
pending an immediate
settlement of the claim

01:33:01.325 --> 01:33:04.619
- which l have just authorized.
- You have what?

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:06.788
Kings Row
signifies one thing:

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.498
- Reliability.
- Now just--

01:33:08.541 --> 01:33:10.709
Our business was built on it.
Our reputation demands it.

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.919
You wiII never ever
get the money back!

01:33:12.962 --> 01:33:15.672
It's for a ransom,
for Christ's sake!

01:33:15.715 --> 01:33:18.216
Are you telling me you waited

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:21.845
15 years for the absolute
right moment?

01:33:21.887 --> 01:33:24.139
All this to punish one man?

01:33:24.181 --> 01:33:28.184
Patience, they say, is a virtue.

01:33:33.774 --> 01:33:36.067
Hobbs:
He took from me

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:41.072
the one thing in this world
that l truly loved.

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:47.329
Mr. Hobbs, this was for her.

01:33:49.248 --> 01:33:50.874
No.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.713
l did it for me.

01:34:12.188 --> 01:34:13.730
( gunshot )

01:34:15.107 --> 01:34:16.608
How did you solve it?

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:20.528
My clumsiness
and your background.

01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:49.557
Come on, come on.

01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:50.934
Here it is, sir.

01:34:50.976 --> 01:34:52.686
Thank you.

01:34:53.979 --> 01:34:56.690
This is a telex from the bank
confirming that the deposit

01:34:56.732 --> 01:34:59.067
has been made corresponding
to the exact amount

01:34:59.110 --> 01:35:00.902
as requested by your client.

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:02.654
Everything looks to be in order.

01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:06.991
( grunting )

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:27.262
Ugh!

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.944
Location of the inventory list.

01:35:47.533 --> 01:35:50.118
What does it say?

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:52.203
WouId you caII
security, please?

01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:57.792
- l don't understand.
- Blank!

01:35:57.835 --> 01:35:59.586
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

01:35:59.628 --> 01:36:02.797
l believe it means the diamonds
are not being returned.

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:51.054
Night then.

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:27.006
The South African Star--
so it wasn't a message?

01:37:27.049 --> 01:37:29.259
Small complication.

01:37:35.766 --> 01:37:37.225
Would you mind?

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:39.769
l'll, uh, leave you to it.

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:08.798
Boyle: My client will then convey where
you may take possession of the goods.

01:38:08.841 --> 01:38:11.968
Excuse me, but there's
a call for Mr. Boyle

01:38:12.011 --> 01:38:14.053
from his office.

01:38:22.688 --> 01:38:24.272
Yes?

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:28.067
Has there been a delivery?

01:38:36.911 --> 01:38:39.704
May I give you
some advice, Miss Quinn?

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:42.457
Well, you are the one
hoIding the gun.

01:38:42.499 --> 01:38:44.876
Life is for living.

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:47.378
lt's there for the taking.

01:38:47.421 --> 01:38:49.422
Grant yourself no regrets.

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:51.549
Go on, put it down.
You don't have it in you.

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:55.511
( clicks )

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.057
lt was never loaded.

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:03.770
lt doesn't matter now.

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:06.731
All done.

01:39:43.102 --> 01:39:45.812
- Workmen: All right, as we go.
- Watch your step.

01:39:45.854 --> 01:39:48.731
- How many more?
- Steady.

01:39:48.774 --> 01:39:52.777
Depends on exactIy
how much is in each box.

01:39:54.029 --> 01:39:55.822
Steady with that.

01:40:00.452 --> 01:40:02.412
Mr. Hopkins.

01:40:02.454 --> 01:40:04.622
Finch:
Miss Quinn.

01:40:05.624 --> 01:40:07.625
Mr. Finch.

01:40:12.923 --> 01:40:15.425
Congratulations.

01:40:15.467 --> 01:40:17.260
The idea came
when you dropped

01:40:17.302 --> 01:40:20.638
an earring in a sink,
is that right?

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.141
l'm sorry l lost you
your finder's fee.

01:40:26.228 --> 01:40:28.521
We didn't find prints
on Sir MiIton's safe.

01:40:29.982 --> 01:40:32.775
We found them on
the opera glasses in his office.

01:40:32.818 --> 01:40:34.527
They were inconclusive.

01:40:35.779 --> 01:40:37.196
Mr. Finch--

01:40:42.661 --> 01:40:46.372
Whatever it is you have
to say, Miss Quinn,

01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:48.958
now is not the right time
to say it.

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:52.670
Maybe there will never
be a right time.

01:40:57.843 --> 01:40:59.677
As strange as it may sound...

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.306
l can't bear the thought
of you spending

01:41:03.348 --> 01:41:06.142
the rest of your life behind bars.

01:41:06.185 --> 01:41:10.772
Naturally you'll have to agree
to assist the investigation.

01:41:10.814 --> 01:41:14.567
With your aII-round
experience, you are...

01:41:14.610 --> 01:41:16.778
perfectly situated to do so.

01:41:22.868 --> 01:41:24.494
Goodbye, Miss Quinn.

01:41:50.646 --> 01:41:52.271
lt has been widely reported

01:41:52.314 --> 01:41:55.233
that a large-scale theft has
taken place on these premises.

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:57.693
As you can see,
that is not the case.

01:42:07.246 --> 01:42:09.247
Quinn:
Ollie took over the company

01:42:09.289 --> 01:42:11.749
and became everything
his father had ever hoped.

01:42:14.419 --> 01:42:16.462
l was more fortunate.

01:42:16.505 --> 01:42:20.049
Dmitriev: We Iook forward
to a long and prosperous...

01:42:20.092 --> 01:42:21.968
and...

01:42:22.010 --> 01:42:24.053
confidential relationship.

01:42:24.096 --> 01:42:26.639
Quinn:
After an extensive investigation,

01:42:26.682 --> 01:42:30.143
it was determined that Mr. Hobbs
had somehow acted alone.

01:42:30.185 --> 01:42:31.894
They never found him.

01:42:31.937 --> 01:42:34.564
A month later l was
passed over again

01:42:34.606 --> 01:42:38.276
and tendered my resignation
the foIIowing day.

01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:55.001
Cassie Jay: Well, forgive me
for being sensationaI,

01:42:55.043 --> 01:42:57.920
but I reaIIy need to know:
What happened with the money?

01:42:57.963 --> 01:43:00.590
Mr. Hobbs?

01:43:00.632 --> 01:43:03.801
WeII, Mr. Hobbs--
well, we never spoke again,

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:08.139
but l did receive a letter
from a bank in Switzerland

01:43:08.182 --> 01:43:10.558
informing me a deposit
had been made

01:43:10.601 --> 01:43:14.103
to a numbered account
on my behalf.

01:43:14.146 --> 01:43:16.939
The sum of £100 million.

01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:19.317
Everything.

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:23.279
And that's where
my real story begins.

01:43:23.322 --> 01:43:26.657
Your article-- it's called
"Women Who Led."

01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:28.868
That's right, isn't it?

01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:33.915
l hope you're inspired.

01:43:33.957 --> 01:43:37.418
l hope you can inspire others.

01:43:37.461 --> 01:43:41.005
You can contact me.
My details are on the back.

01:43:54.186 --> 01:43:57.104
Quinn: "l never intended
this to happen,

01:43:57.147 --> 01:44:01.692
but the burden of Hobbs' money
sent me in a different direction.

01:44:01.735 --> 01:44:04.111
l discovered the world

01:44:04.154 --> 01:44:06.030
and through it,
l discovered myself.

01:44:13.038 --> 01:44:16.958
You'd be surprised how long it takes
to give away £100 million.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.918
lt's taken me 40 years.

01:44:18.961 --> 01:44:21.712
And just today...

01:44:21.755 --> 01:44:24.090
today l gave away
the Iast penny.

01:44:26.426 --> 01:44:29.845
l'm free at last."

01:44:29.888 --> 01:44:32.056
God damn it.

01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:36.477
"Except...

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.772
except for that jewel
that you held in your hand.

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:43.526
That l've been saving
for a rainy day.

01:44:52.119 --> 01:44:53.953
Or perhaps...

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:58.249
or perhaps it's
the last little piece

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:00.376
of vanity that l have left."

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:06.299
( jazz music playing )

01:45:19.229 --> 01:45:21.605
( theme music playing )
