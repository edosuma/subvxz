WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.501
ANNOUNCER:<i> Thanks for</i>
<i>downloading this Fox show.</i>

00:02.503 --> 00:05.571
<i>And don't miss all-new episodes</i>
<i>only on Fox.</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:09.675
I am so excited
about this glamping trip.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.344
Sleeping bags are for
hobos and children.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.812
WINSTON:
I am so pumped
for this trip.

00:13.814 --> 00:17.016
Aly and I figured out how many
times we would have had sex

00:17.018 --> 00:19.818
since we've been apart,
and it's a whole bunch.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.187
And we're gonna play
catch-up on all of it.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.655
All 52 times.

00:23.657 --> 00:27.126
I am about to take Aly
to Mount Smushmore.

00:27.895 --> 00:29.728
Know what I'm saying?
(laughs)

00:29.730 --> 00:33.032
Aw.
That's lovely.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.900
We need to invite other people.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.402
What about Nick?
No, he can't.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.003
He has some big
writing weekend.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.738
Wants me to give him
notes on his novel.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.641
He has all the pages in
some large freezer bag.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.743
It's a hard presentation
to get excited about.

00:44.745 --> 00:46.545
You know who would really want
to come?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.713
(groans)

00:47.715 --> 00:49.681
I am in!

00:49.683 --> 00:51.650
Do you want me to bring
my retractable s'mores pole?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.352
Is that the car antenna
that you've been putting

00:53.354 --> 00:54.753
in the dishwasher?

00:54.755 --> 00:56.522
That is a low-level mystery

00:56.524 --> 00:58.824
that has been driving me insane.
Making him crazy.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.392
It's really handy.
All right, Jess.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.161
So just a quick warning, okay?

01:02.163 --> 01:04.663
This is a pretty
couple-y's trip, and...

01:04.665 --> 01:07.399
you know, we just don't want you
to feel like a third wheel.
Yeah.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.734
Oh. I have people I can bring.

01:08.736 --> 01:09.668
You...

01:09.670 --> 01:10.602
I joined a singles group.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.703
You're meeting new people.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.005
I think that's great.
(quietly): Oh, my.

01:13.007 --> 01:14.239
It's actually...

01:14.241 --> 01:16.675
a group of all singles dedicated

01:16.677 --> 01:18.444
to keeping each other single.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.013
Wow.
I think they could probably
come on the trip.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.948
Emotionally,
they may not be available,

01:22.950 --> 01:25.751
but socially,
they're available as hell.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.119
(quietly):
Just talk to her
really quickly.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.454
You know what?
Oh, you're
already texting people.

01:28.456 --> 01:29.688
They're probably not...

01:29.690 --> 01:30.589
They're in!
Oh!

01:30.591 --> 01:32.791
All of them!
(laughing)

01:32.793 --> 01:34.960
Honestly, they would have gone
to the DMV with you,

01:34.962 --> 01:36.462
if you had asked.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.131
(laughing)

01:39.133 --> 01:40.999
¶ ¶

01:44.772 --> 01:47.806
(inhales)
(yells)

01:47.808 --> 01:49.741
How long have you
been standing there?

01:49.743 --> 01:51.076
(whines)

01:51.078 --> 01:52.778
What happened to you?

01:52.780 --> 01:55.714
<i> The Pepperwood Chronicles,</i>
that's what happened to me.

01:55.716 --> 01:58.283
So it's really that bad.
Nick.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.252
This book...

02:00.254 --> 02:02.087
is magnificent.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.789
What?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.958
Julius Pepperwood?

02:05.960 --> 02:09.795
A hard-boiled Chicago cop
turned New Orleans detective,

02:09.797 --> 02:11.497
racing around on fan-boats,

02:11.499 --> 02:15.300
drowning that two-faced DA
in a bucket of jambalaya.

02:15.302 --> 02:16.135
Yeah. Right in the jambalaya.

02:16.137 --> 02:19.471
Finding John F. Kennedy...

02:19.473 --> 02:20.806
alive?

02:20.808 --> 02:21.807
That wasn't too far?

02:21.809 --> 02:23.642
It's a masterpiece, Nick.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.811
Is that my whiteboard?

02:25.813 --> 02:27.679
You said I could have it.
Well, we both know
that's not true,

02:27.681 --> 02:29.615
but if it helps you get more
of this story out,

02:29.617 --> 02:31.316
then, yes,
you are welcome to it.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.386
Well, all right, Schmidt,
hit me; I want your notes.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.422
No notes!

02:37.424 --> 02:39.358
No notes?
No notes.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.126
No notes?!
No notes.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.494
No notes!
No notes.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.529
No notes!

02:43.531 --> 02:44.863
No notes.
It's perfect, Nick.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.132
I want another chapter by
the time I get back on Sunday.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.368
Then I guess it's time
for me to get to work.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.470
My little wobbly-nosed
Michael Chabon.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.804
(both laugh)

02:52.806 --> 02:54.306
Hey, congratulations.
Thank you, man.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.041
I, uh... Thank you.
I needed it.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.513
I'm a writer.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.148
(shrieks)
'Sup?

03:03.150 --> 03:04.650
(both laughing)

03:04.652 --> 03:06.785
(smooching)
ALY: I love you. I miss you.
I love you. I miss you.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.220
You clearly
didn't get my text,

03:08.222 --> 03:10.155
because your pants
are still on.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.190
(grunts)

03:11.192 --> 03:12.491
(whooping)
So excited about this.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.026
Hey, Aly! Oh!

03:14.028 --> 03:15.994
Your bra's already off.
Okay.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.196
We're out the door.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.730
None of this in my car,
please.

03:18.732 --> 03:19.831
I just had it shampooed.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.033
Jess.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.202
I called ahead and got
us an early yurt check-in.

03:23.204 --> 03:24.703
Oh.
Beep-beep.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.071
People about to have sex
coming through.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.506
WINSTON: Look out.
Aren't you coming?

03:27.508 --> 03:30.375
Actually, I'm gonna
go with my group.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.744
We rented a van. It has
a built-in microwave.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.413
We're all really
stoked about it.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.681
You're not making me feel
any better

03:35.683 --> 03:37.082
about this group of strangers.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.650
Well, it's not all strangers.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.319
Some of them are friends!
(laughing)

03:40.321 --> 03:42.521
Robby?
My Robby?
Yeah. I got here

03:42.523 --> 03:45.357
way too early, so I've
just been standing outside,

03:45.359 --> 03:47.226
kind of waiting for my
opportunity to enter.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.327
How'd I do?

03:48.329 --> 03:49.561
Robby, are you
in this group?

03:49.563 --> 03:51.263
(snorts)
(laughing):
Is he in the group?

03:51.265 --> 03:53.232
Robby is the
founder, president,

03:53.234 --> 03:54.499
and secretary of the group.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.168
I formed the group
after Nadia dumped me.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.402
I always use two sugars.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.572
My mom says 'cause
I'm so sweet, you know.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.840
Oh, whoa!

04:01.842 --> 04:03.075
I didn't want to be alone,

04:03.077 --> 04:04.610
but I also didn't want to be
in a relationship.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.112
And that's when he got the idea
to bring people together

04:07.114 --> 04:08.780
to help each other stay single.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.748
Yeah, we meet weekly

04:09.750 --> 04:11.783
for non-romantic companionship.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.252
But most of all,
we just have fun.
Yeah.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.754
Like last week, we shut
down this Korean barbecue.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.256
We paid with 13
different credit cards,

04:17.258 --> 04:19.291
and we were asked to
never come back again.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.792
It was epic!

04:20.794 --> 04:22.127
That sounds awesome.
Oh, man.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.463
It's a really cool group,
and we have our own motto.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.199
BOTH:
I'm single and I'm sufficient.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.305
That's I-S-I-S.
That's ISIS.
Th-That's ISIS.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.774
Oh, my God.
You're asking people
to join ISIS.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.442
No, n-n-n-n-n-n-no.
As communication czar
I should have caught that.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.443
Yeah.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.696
Isn't this group

04:40.697 --> 04:42.948
just a painfully transparent
stall until you meet someone?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.216
Being single is a choice.
Yeah.

04:44.218 --> 04:45.717
Don't single-shame.
What is single-shame?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.119
No, honey. He was not
single-shaming you.
I-I wasn't...

04:47.121 --> 04:48.620
That was not
his intention at all.
I don't even know what that is.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.156
Couples always try to
talk down to singles.

04:51.158 --> 04:53.792
We can do everything
that you guys can do.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.661
I take myself out
for a dessert date every Sunday.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.162
Yeah, and yesterday,
I had a backache,

04:57.164 --> 04:59.097
and I rubbed it myself,
in a doorjamb.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.632
This is bummin' me out.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.934
Is this group gonna
be a bummer? Be honest.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.436
Absolutely not.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.270
There's Brenda.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.606
<i> She's a circuit court judge</i>

05:07.608 --> 05:10.342
<i> who also teaches</i>
<i> taxidermy class for kids.</i>

05:10.344 --> 05:13.345
<i> And Hugh.</i>
<i> He grows his own onions.</i>

05:13.347 --> 05:14.846
<i> My former boss</i>
<i> and current friend,</i>

05:14.848 --> 05:16.315
<i> Principal Foster.</i>

05:16.317 --> 05:18.850
<i> His hip surgeon has okayed him</i>
<i> for sex,</i>

05:18.852 --> 05:20.419
<i> but he hasn't okayed himself.</i>

05:20.421 --> 05:23.121
<i> And of course, Robby,</i>
<i> our leader.</i>

05:23.123 --> 05:24.956
Have you ever seen
a group more ready

05:24.958 --> 05:26.992
to have fun
with themselves?

05:26.994 --> 05:28.794
(cheering)

05:28.796 --> 05:32.864
(horse hooves clopping)

05:37.638 --> 05:39.638
Just look at this view;
we needed this so badly.

05:39.640 --> 05:43.375
It's-it's perfect.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.476
Is it, though?

05:44.478 --> 05:46.645
(camera shutters clicking)

05:46.647 --> 05:47.979
Can you stop
hogging the vista?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.848
There are other people who
would like to take a photo.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.982
I don't want to
lose this light.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.484
It's a traditional
high-noon.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.353
Don't couple-splain
light to us.

05:54.355 --> 05:56.021
It just seems
like it would be easier

05:56.023 --> 05:57.723
if you guys took
a group photo.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.324
We actually need a picture
for our Web site,
Oh, yeah.

05:59.326 --> 06:01.526
so, all right,
you can take a group photo.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.627
All right, let's do this.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.529
Now, I'm only taking
one shot,

06:04.531 --> 06:05.364
so if the
first one's

06:05.366 --> 06:06.298
a silly one,
you're gonna have

06:06.300 --> 06:07.699
to live with
a silly one.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.634
Okay. One,

06:09.636 --> 06:11.470
two, three.
There we go.
Great photo.

06:11.472 --> 06:12.471
I'm gonna
need one, too.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.472
Actually, we're all
gonna need one.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.339
What?
Yeah, we don't
share phones

06:14.341 --> 06:15.640
like you people.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.209
Who shares phones?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.378
How would we call
each other?
I don't know.

06:20.414 --> 06:23.081
I can't do this.
This is... Take these back.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.816
You guys
are ruining

06:24.818 --> 06:26.485
a perfectly good
vista moment.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.888
Can't you go someplace else
and "enjoy being single"?

06:29.890 --> 06:35.327
(gasps) Did you just quote-hands
"enjoy being single" to us?

06:35.329 --> 06:39.064
You guys are telling each other
that you're happy being this,

06:39.066 --> 06:42.768
when we all know that
you would rather be this.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.870
No. This is jazz hands,

06:44.872 --> 06:47.606
the end of an explosive
musical number.

06:47.608 --> 06:51.343
This is O.J. trying
to put on the bloody glove.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.544
This is
freedom!

06:52.546 --> 06:53.945
This is flying!

06:53.947 --> 06:56.114
This is praying
that you can go back to this!

06:56.116 --> 06:58.350
This is high fives
for everybody!

06:58.352 --> 07:00.619
All around! Yes!
(chuckling)

07:00.621 --> 07:04.122
Let's go to the lake, guys.
Bye.
Yeah!

07:04.124 --> 07:05.290
FOSTER:
I call dibs

07:05.292 --> 07:08.260
on the slime-free part.
Okay.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.628
Just enjoy the
view. I mean...

07:09.630 --> 07:12.831
This is O.J. putting
back on the glove.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.135
No notes.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.241
Okay, just...

07:23.243 --> 07:26.278
just start and see what...
Just start. No notes.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.780
All me.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.285
No notes.
What does "no notes" even mean?!

07:33.287 --> 07:34.586
No notes.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.787
No notes?

07:35.789 --> 07:38.523
Come on.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.993
(chuckles)

07:41.995 --> 07:44.796
Nick, I'm communing with nature,
and I'm almost at peace.

07:44.798 --> 07:45.797
What do you want?

07:45.799 --> 07:46.665
No notes?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.667
Seriously?
It is just so nice

07:48.669 --> 07:51.803
to get out of the city
and watch TV.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.972
What about this dumb thing?
When Pepperwood just watches

07:53.974 --> 07:56.141
a block of local news.
Oh, I found that part

07:56.143 --> 07:58.810
to be gutting, Nick.
I mean, the irony

07:58.812 --> 08:01.146
that Pepperwood's violent world
is being translated

08:01.148 --> 08:03.782
into sound bites
for mass consumption...

08:03.784 --> 08:05.784
That's just me transcribing
Channel 3 News!

08:05.786 --> 08:07.652
I didn't even change
the anchors' names!

08:07.654 --> 08:09.454
It's called realism, Nick.
No.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.789
Good-bye, genius.
No!

08:10.791 --> 08:11.957
(groans)

08:11.959 --> 08:14.626
Ooh, that was... Ooh.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.361
WINSTON:
<i> Oh, my gosh.</i>

08:16.363 --> 08:17.796
13 times.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.965
Yeah. It's
a lot of times.
Yeah.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.133
A lot of times.
(chuckles)
I had a good time.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.668
I had a great time.
I could've gone

08:23.670 --> 08:25.303
so many more times
than that.

08:25.305 --> 08:26.505
Yeah, that's
actually nothing.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.672
(both chuckle)

08:27.674 --> 08:29.474
I could go all
night, girl.
I could go

08:29.476 --> 08:32.477
tens of...
so many more times.
Tens of... Ten... Yeah.

08:32.479 --> 08:35.347
Cool, cool, cool,
cool, cool, cool.
(sighs) Cool, cool, cool, cool.

08:35.349 --> 08:36.848
That's what's up.
That's what's up.
(phone ringing)

08:36.850 --> 08:39.584
That's what's up.
Oh, it's the phone.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.489
(breathy):
Hella?
Winston, are you...

08:44.491 --> 08:45.657
Hey, Winnie, are you okay?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.058
You sound like
you're being chased up a hill.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.628
Oh, no. Aly and I are
just breaking each other off

08:49.630 --> 08:51.563
basically nonstop.
It's Nick.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.666
I told him we were breaking each
other off basically nonstop.
I know. I can hear you, honey.

08:54.668 --> 08:57.002
Oh, you heard
everything? Okay.
Yeah. What does he want?

08:57.004 --> 08:58.370
I'm in crisis right now.
Could you read my book

08:58.372 --> 08:59.404
and give me notes, please?

08:59.406 --> 09:01.806
Oh, man. I don't want
to take a break.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.174
Mmm. Mm-mm.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.743
I'm like a freight train
right now.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.244
I can't slow down.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.078
Me either.

09:07.080 --> 09:07.979
This is crisis!

09:07.981 --> 09:09.814
But...
Guys,

09:09.816 --> 09:11.816
supporting our friend's
artistic endeavors
guys...

09:11.818 --> 09:13.818
is also insanely...
Hey, guys. Guys, pay attention.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.520
It's sexy.
This is crisis.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.589
But I was thinking
the same thing.
Oh, thank God.
Hello?

09:17.591 --> 09:20.258
Winston! Winston,
We could easily just both
read the book

09:20.260 --> 09:22.928
you're supposed to be my friend.
at the same time,
and then when we're done,

09:22.930 --> 09:24.763
just get right back at it,
Yes.

09:24.765 --> 09:26.031
right?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Great.

09:26.033 --> 09:27.699
Now, do y...
do you guys want a PDF

09:27.701 --> 09:29.768
or do you want
100 individual JPEGs?

09:29.770 --> 09:33.271
JPEGs, JPEGs, J...
JPEGs.
Uh, 100 individual
JPEGs, please.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.575
Yeah!
This is gonna take forever.

09:36.577 --> 09:38.944
(laughing)

09:39.913 --> 09:41.346
(groans)

09:41.348 --> 09:42.914
Five-three.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.882
(grunts)

09:43.884 --> 09:46.117
Hey. Oh, I was just...

09:46.119 --> 09:49.120
just playing a little single
and sufficient badminton.

09:49.122 --> 09:50.455
Well, I hope you worked up
an appetite,

09:50.457 --> 09:52.624
because I'm gonna make
my Singles Sliders.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.292
Oh, yeah?
Okay, so what I do
is I take the meat

09:54.294 --> 09:56.461
from three different sliders,
and then I just sort of mash 'em

09:56.463 --> 09:58.129
into one big boy
that stands on his own.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.432
Oh. So, like a burger.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.466
Yeah, it's like a burger
except it's bigger.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.436
Oh. Well,
if it isn't Schmidt.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.804
Or should I call you
Schmidt-tata

10:05.806 --> 10:07.806
'cause you have so much egg
on your face?

10:07.808 --> 10:10.809
You little Italian
egg omelet.
(laughs, snorts) Nice.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.811
Jess, what's happening
in the lake over there?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.446
Wait, is that
a jellyfish?
Come over here.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.448
Oh, please, that's
so much less sexual

10:16.450 --> 10:19.284
than the stuff that you and
Nick do on a regular basis.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.752
(chuckles)
Ow.

10:20.754 --> 10:22.621
(sighs)
It's happening.

10:22.623 --> 10:23.922
Okay, Robby...

10:23.924 --> 10:25.123
I'm on it.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.658
(Hugh and Brenda
laughing)

10:26.660 --> 10:28.827
Guys, guys,

10:28.829 --> 10:30.428
no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

10:30.430 --> 10:31.663
You guys know that you can
only be in this group

10:31.665 --> 10:33.131
if you're single, right?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.466
It's tough.

10:34.468 --> 10:35.634
I'm very horny.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.636
I want you guys to be strong.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.504
Let's do the motto.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.806
I'm single
I'm single

10:41.808 --> 10:43.608
and I'm sufficient.
and I'm sufficient.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.776
Didn't sound like you
meant it. One more.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.978
BOTH:
I'm single and I'm sufficient.
Yes.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.681
One last time.
I'm single and I'm sufficient!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.683
Yes!
FOSTER:
Well, I just hope

10:51.685 --> 10:53.685
we don't see a repeat
of that kind of behavior

10:53.687 --> 10:55.153
with me later on.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.155
You were amazing out
there. Your ability

10:57.157 --> 10:59.724
to dampen sexual
chemistry is astounding.

11:05.365 --> 11:06.865
(chuckles softly)

11:08.969 --> 11:10.869
Uh...
(clears throat) Thanks.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.477
FOSTER:
Hey, guys!

11:19.479 --> 11:22.213
I just caught a fish
with my hand!

11:26.820 --> 11:28.353
Wow. Nick's book is astonishing.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.890
I thought it was gonna take
forever, but... it was perfect.

11:31.892 --> 11:33.658
He really brings you
into the world.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.394
Every minor character
is so well thought out.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.630
The newsboy?
You could see his whole life.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.532
And am I the only one who
thought that the murderer's name

11:40.534 --> 11:42.567
was in the song?
The murderer's song
was in the song!

11:42.569 --> 11:43.802
Ah. So good.

11:43.804 --> 11:44.736
No notes.

11:44.738 --> 11:45.804
Yeah.
Yeah.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.807
Well...

11:48.809 --> 11:50.742
sex?

11:50.744 --> 11:52.177
Yes!
Yeah?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.678
Sex.
I'm ready
if you're ready.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.647
Yeah. Yeah.
All right.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.749
Just a short walk
to our yurt.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.051
Unless we take the scenic route.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.521
Oh. Nothing gets me
in the mood like scenery.
Oh.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.422
Mmm?
Let's do that.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.757
Yeah, let's
go that way.

12:05.759 --> 12:06.758
Yeah, let's do that.
The scenic way.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.897
Perhaps you could find
the perfect bun

12:12.899 --> 12:14.666
if-- I don't know--
you had your glasses.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.202
Oh. Oh, you know... you
know who else has glasses?

12:17.204 --> 12:19.404
Six out of ten people
in the developed world,

12:19.406 --> 12:21.206
including Robby and I?

12:21.208 --> 12:24.342
Jess, just give over to it.
We're happy for you.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.711
Use your yurt.
You have a world-class yurt.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.546
Yeah, and if this
is about me and Robby

12:28.548 --> 12:30.548
dating years
ago, trust me,

12:30.550 --> 12:32.117
it doesn't matter.
Mm-mm.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.618
We only did hand stuff,
per his neurosis,
(groans)

12:33.620 --> 12:35.420
so you totally
have my blessing.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.287
Blessing for what?

12:36.289 --> 12:37.722
This.
That.
Ugh!

12:37.724 --> 12:39.624
Guys, I am not into Robby.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.626
And I could never date a guy
who wears glasses

12:41.628 --> 12:44.295
because of the clown
from my dreams.

12:44.297 --> 12:46.297
The clown who wears glasses.

12:47.300 --> 12:50.268
Oh, my God, that clown is me.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.270
I'm not dating Robby, okay?

12:52.272 --> 12:53.271
Hey.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.606
Oh, Robby.
Oh, hey, Robby.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.774
I heard my name a bunch
of times. I mean, I could tell

12:55.776 --> 12:57.809
that you weren't trying
to call me in here, but, uh,

12:57.811 --> 12:59.644
my curiosity kicked in,
so... A couple of us

12:59.646 --> 13:01.713
are gonna wander down and,
uh, you know, tell some stories

13:01.715 --> 13:04.883
and, uh...
(plays guitar)

13:04.885 --> 13:06.551
...sing a few songs.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.387
That sounds great. Actually,
you know who loves to sing?

13:09.389 --> 13:12.457
Actually, I've really been
hating music lately.
Come on, Jess,

13:12.459 --> 13:14.859
you're a whore
for singin'. Please.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.798
¶ ¶

13:19.800 --> 13:23.802
¶ I hear the drums
echoing tonight ¶

13:23.804 --> 13:25.637
¶ But she
hears only ¶

13:25.639 --> 13:29.808
¶ Whispers of some
quiet conversation ¶

13:29.810 --> 13:32.477
¶ ¶

13:32.479 --> 13:35.647
¶ She's coming in,
12:30 flight ¶

13:35.649 --> 13:38.283
¶ The moonlit wings
reflect the stars ¶

13:38.285 --> 13:41.786
¶ That guide me
towards salvation... ¶

13:41.788 --> 13:43.955
(phone ringing)
Damn it!

13:43.957 --> 13:46.791
Nick, if this is about notes,
so help me God.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.793
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
stop bugging you

13:48.795 --> 13:49.961
until you note me, Schmidt.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.496
All right, Nick.
Here's a note.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.132
Stop cutting yourself off at
the knees like a selfish coward.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.801
Okay, great, great. I love
the direction we're going.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.670
We're getting more critical, but
can you refocus to the writing?

13:58.672 --> 14:01.139
No, Nick, I cannot,
and you want to know why?

14:01.141 --> 14:02.540
Because you are a writer.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.008
And a damn good one at that.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.778
But you're just too scared
to admit it to yourself.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.479
Good-bye, sir.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.683
No! Damn,
you raven-haired dandy boy.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.718
Yeah, thought
carving our names

14:13.720 --> 14:16.020
in the trees would have
taken longer.
Yeah.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.455
(owl hooting)

14:17.457 --> 14:20.692
So... do you want...
want to have sex?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.694
Yeah. I think that's...
Yeah, let's...

14:22.696 --> 14:27.198
Listen, Aly, I got to admit,
I'm pretty tapped out.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.968
I-I'm sorry to say it like
that, but, you know, I'm...
No. Me, too!

14:29.970 --> 14:32.303
We've had too much
sex too fast!
I know!

14:32.305 --> 14:33.905
Why didn't we pace
ourselves?
(sighs)

14:33.907 --> 14:35.406
I'm so exhausted.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.642
Oh, my gosh, I think this
whole ordeal just illustrates

14:37.644 --> 14:39.878
why three months
<i> isn't</i> three days.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.413
So happy you said that.
(laughs)

14:42.415 --> 14:45.717
I'm just happy to be
in the same place as you.
Me, too.

14:52.659 --> 14:58.162
And, you know,
we did do it 13 times.

14:58.164 --> 15:01.065
That's a lot.
That's a lot of times.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.501
But you know what my
favorite time was?
11?

15:03.503 --> 15:05.236
11. You knew.
(laughs)

15:05.238 --> 15:06.771
Oh, I knew. 11 was great.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.573
Mm. Maybe we should do 11 again.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.676
But this time...
I'm the mermaid.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.379
Okay. I'm the mermaid.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.947
(laughing):
No, I'm the mermaid.

15:15.949 --> 15:18.783
Kind of, uh...
Yeah, right there.
Perfect.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.084
Get your butt down there.
(sighs)

15:20.086 --> 15:21.619
Come here!

15:21.621 --> 15:23.087
Ooh!
(laughs)

15:23.089 --> 15:28.626
BOTH: ¶ It's gonna take a lot
to drag me away from you ¶

15:28.628 --> 15:34.399
¶ There's nothing that a hundred
men or more could ever do ¶

15:34.401 --> 15:37.969
¶ I bless the rains
down in Africa... ¶

15:37.971 --> 15:39.103
This is electric.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.072
¶ I bless the rains ¶

15:41.074 --> 15:43.441
¶ Down in Africa ¶

15:43.443 --> 15:44.742
¶ I bless the rain ¶

15:44.744 --> 15:46.577
BOTH:
¶ I bless the rains ¶

15:46.579 --> 15:49.547
¶ Down in Africa ¶

15:49.549 --> 15:51.716
¶ Gonna take some time ¶

15:51.718 --> 15:55.653
¶ To do the things
we never had ¶

15:55.655 --> 15:58.957
¶ Had. ¶
Wait! Stop!

15:58.959 --> 16:00.358
I can't!

16:01.661 --> 16:04.028
You can't what?

16:05.298 --> 16:08.833
I can't ignore what's going on
with Brenda and Hugh!

16:08.835 --> 16:10.802
We weren't
doing anything!

16:10.804 --> 16:12.303
I hope you guys were
behaving, all right?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.638
Because you know what
happens on strike two.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.306
Strike two and...

16:15.308 --> 16:16.975
Strike... You're not
out on strike two,

16:16.977 --> 16:18.776
but, you know, strike two,
you're on thin ice.

16:18.778 --> 16:20.812
Jess should be on thin ice.
Ugh!

16:20.814 --> 16:23.064
She took us
on a couples trip!

16:23.065 --> 16:25.315
Yeah, that's like
taking alcoholics to a brewery!

16:25.318 --> 16:27.652
Nobody here wants
to hear from you, Hugh.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.687
You Hugh.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.789
You... Hugh.

16:31.791 --> 16:34.525
You made us hang out with
your lame couples friends!

16:34.527 --> 16:36.627
How are we lame?
There is no reason
to attack us.

16:36.629 --> 16:39.630
And when singing Toto,
why is it always "Africa"?

16:39.632 --> 16:41.466
They've got a
deep catalog!
ROBBY:
Okay.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.001
Look, I think we can all agree

16:43.003 --> 16:44.802
that Jess is a very important
member of this group.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.204
You hypocrite.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.673
Before you cast aspersions
on anyone else,

16:48.675 --> 16:51.209
you need to take a good long
look at yourself, Robby!

16:51.211 --> 16:53.177
The emperor
I don't even know

16:53.179 --> 16:54.979
has no clothes!
why we bothered
coming here!

16:54.981 --> 16:56.347
(overlapping chatter)

16:56.349 --> 16:58.049
And you sexualized Toto.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.183
No, you make a good...

16:59.185 --> 17:01.319
I know those guys.
They're good guys!

17:01.321 --> 17:02.720
Know what? Enough!

17:03.790 --> 17:06.557
Okay, I'm not, uh...

17:06.559 --> 17:08.726
Guys, I'm not actually
gonna smash my guitar

17:08.728 --> 17:09.994
to get your attention.

17:09.996 --> 17:12.163
But listen, I don't want you
to lose faith in this group.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.831
Okay? Just...

17:13.833 --> 17:15.700
lose faith in me.

17:15.702 --> 17:19.637
Because you're right. I have
been a hypocrite. Uh...

17:20.507 --> 17:23.274
I do have feelings for Jess.

17:24.244 --> 17:25.343
Ooh.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.577
(gasps)

17:26.579 --> 17:29.313
Just... he didn't say
what kind of feelings.

17:29.315 --> 17:31.282
They're sexual and
romantic feelings.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.051
Oh, wow.
Oh, boy.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.652
BRENDA:
Well, what do you know?

17:39.559 --> 17:41.826
I'm really sorry about
last night. Where's the group?

17:41.828 --> 17:44.862
The group is kind of
permanently done.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.831
Robby sent out
a final e-mail.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.566
It was in Latin, uh,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.201
and it was in
this gothic font.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.702
I'm kind of
worried about him.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.604
Why don't you give
the guy a chance, Jess?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.706
(sighs)
I'm not interested right now.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.242
So, what, are you just
gonna give up on love,

17:58.244 --> 17:59.877
be alone forever? Like...
No, you know me.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.612
I love love!

18:01.614 --> 18:04.549
Anything in pairs
makes me choked up.

18:04.551 --> 18:08.753
Shoes, socks, chopsticks.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.789
I'm just in kind of
a confusing place right now,

18:11.791 --> 18:14.725
and I think you guys know why.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.627
It's about Nick,
right?

18:16.629 --> 18:19.397
Yes, of course
we are talking about Nick.
I knew it.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.398
Yes, I'm talking about Nick.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.266
I knew it.
I knew it.

18:22.268 --> 18:23.734
But, look, I want you
to know something.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.237
I'm really, really happy
being single right now.

18:26.239 --> 18:29.107
I'm sorry if my group
ruined your weekend.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.142
They're really cool people
if you get to know them.

18:31.144 --> 18:32.310
I'm sure.
(phone chimes)

18:32.312 --> 18:33.978
Yeah.
Oh, my God,
I have to go.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.580
Foster got a corn
chip in his eye.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.781
SCHMIDT:
Okay, you know what?

18:36.783 --> 18:38.116
We need to make a pact

18:38.118 --> 18:40.785
to befriend at least one
other married couple.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.487
Yeah, but how are
we gonna do that?

18:42.489 --> 18:44.622
We don't have a kid, and I
refuse to take cooking classes.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.125
I don't know. Maybe we just go
to a Norah Jones concert,

18:47.127 --> 18:49.827
stand outside
and look lost.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.763
Well, Schmidty,
you pulled a real

18:52.765 --> 18:56.634
Mr. Miyagi on the whole
"no notes, tough love" routine.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.136
Let me see it.

18:58.138 --> 19:01.506
Ooh! Nick, there's a whole
nother chapter here!

19:01.508 --> 19:02.807
How did you make this happen?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.809
I worked...
because of you.
And...

19:04.811 --> 19:08.513
who is this wise,

19:08.515 --> 19:10.681
denim-clad Jewish chaplain?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.450
Sch-Schmith?

19:12.452 --> 19:14.318
That was the big thing.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.755
You helped me realize that
Pepperwood needed a Schmidt.

19:17.757 --> 19:20.124
Okay. While it's an honor

19:20.126 --> 19:23.127
to be included in the world
that you've created here,

19:23.129 --> 19:25.663
um... (sighs)

19:25.665 --> 19:29.000
the Schmith character seems,
uh, grotesque.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.368
Yeah, he's unlikeable.
I don't understand why,

19:30.370 --> 19:33.638
when we meet this character,
he-he's kicking a puppy.

19:33.640 --> 19:36.174
He's the bad guy...
in Pepperwood's life.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.508
He's mean, he's...

19:37.510 --> 19:40.211
He's not somebody you want
to introduce to Mom and Dad.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.180
The cha... the character.
Schmith is a dirt bag.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.315
I have no respect for Schmith,

19:44.317 --> 19:45.650
and neither should anybody else.
I think that's

19:45.652 --> 19:47.818
a mistake to say those things
about the character.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.521
I appreciate what you're saying,
but I'm happy with what I have.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.657
I don't need any notes.
Oh, now it's no notes?!

19:52.659 --> 19:54.959
Nick?<i> Nick?!</i>

19:54.961 --> 19:57.795
Sit anywhere?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.207
What's up, Robby?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.675
Hey, sorry. I'll leave.
I was almost done..

20:10.677 --> 20:12.410
No! You'll ruin your food!

20:12.412 --> 20:13.844
Yeah, just like
I ruined the group.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.013
You didn't ruin
anything. We're...

20:16.015 --> 20:18.416
We're still
hanging out.
Really?

20:18.418 --> 20:20.885
Okay, so could you guys
vote me back in maybe?

20:20.887 --> 20:22.853
We voted to get
rid of voting.

20:22.855 --> 20:25.122
It's the same, just,
uh, without the rules.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.728
Jess, I don't really
know what to say.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.762
Don't say anything.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.831
It's fine. I'm
just gonna read.

20:33.833 --> 20:37.268
Um, Winston gave me
a copy of Nick's book.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.270
It's actually pretty good.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.838
Um...
(laughing)

20:40.840 --> 20:42.540
Except the foreword says,

20:42.542 --> 20:45.009
"Best enjoyed with
shrimp cocktail." (laughs)

20:45.011 --> 20:47.378
You can go back to
your crossword puzzle.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.780
It's a word search.
Oh.

20:54.187 --> 20:57.622
Hey, Robby?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.624
Hmm?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.292
Should... should we
just share a table?

21:01.294 --> 21:02.793
Is that crazy?

21:02.795 --> 21:04.795
I don't think
it's crazy at all. Do you?

21:04.797 --> 21:07.632
No. I mean, I
suggested it, so, no.
Yeah.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.967
Okay.
Oh, thanks.

21:12.405 --> 21:17.475
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh ¶

21:17.477 --> 21:19.977
(sighs)

21:19.979 --> 21:22.780
¶ Ooh, ooh, ooh... ¶

21:22.782 --> 21:25.016
Hey, Jess?

21:25.885 --> 21:28.252
Um...

21:28.254 --> 21:30.988
I just found the word
"locomotive,"

21:30.990 --> 21:32.923
backwards and diagonal.

21:32.925 --> 21:37.928
¶ Saint Laurent
built in the '70s ¶

21:37.930 --> 21:42.633
¶ No intelligent thing

21:42.635 --> 21:44.702
¶ Oh. ¶
