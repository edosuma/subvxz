00:22.905 --> 00:24.690
<i>Viceroy Gunray captured!</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.469
<i>Senator Padm√© Amidala
has scored a victory</i>

00:27.594 --> 00:30.821
<i>against the Separatist alliance
on the remote world of Rodia,</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:34.119
<i>securing the arrest
of diabolical confederate leader</i>

00:34.244 --> 00:35.651
<i>Nute Gunray.</i>

00:35.776 --> 00:38.903
<i>The Jedi council has
dispatched Master Luminara Unduli</i>

00:39.028 --> 00:41.574
<i>and Anakin Skywalker's
Padawan Ahsoka</i>

00:41.699 --> 00:45.086
<i>to escort the Viceroy
to Coruscant under heavy guard.</i>

00:45.211 --> 00:48.421
<i>Once there, he will face trial
for his many war crimes.</i>

00:53.215 --> 00:55.512
Captain, have you made contact
with the cruiser?

00:55.711 --> 00:58.181
Yes, General.
We'll patch you through now.

00:59.027 --> 01:00.350
Jedi cruiser Tranquility,

01:00.527 --> 01:04.177
this is General Luminara Unduli
requesting permission to land.

01:04.340 --> 01:05.528
<i>You are clear, General.</i>

01:05.653 --> 01:09.074
- <i>We await your prisoner's arrival.</i>
- Thank you, Captain Argyus.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.194
I look forward
to delivering him to you.

01:11.526 --> 01:13.561
I am a man of great wealth,

01:13.686 --> 01:17.201
and I can be very generous
to my allies.

01:17.457 --> 01:20.871
That is a very tempting offer,
Viceroy.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.290
In the meantime,
I have a gift for you.

01:24.965 --> 01:27.752
Finally.
It's been such a boring trip.

01:42.527 --> 01:45.525
This is an outrageous
miscarriage of justice.

01:46.153 --> 01:48.881
- I demand my litigator.
- Keep moving.

01:50.962 --> 01:54.654
Greetings, General. We have the brig
all ready for this traitor.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.158
Very good, Captain.
Commander Gree, let's get under way.

01:58.342 --> 02:00.192
Right away, sir. Let's move.

02:07.403 --> 02:08.752
Senate commandos?

02:09.026 --> 02:12.590
How does a money-grubbing worm
like Gunray rate all this security?

02:12.715 --> 02:14.215
He doesn't look that dangerous.

02:14.466 --> 02:18.344
Don't let your overconfidence
give Gunray another advantage, Ahsoka.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.465
Even now,

02:19.590 --> 02:22.327
his allies may be conspiring
against us.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.444
<i>Gunray's capture</i>

02:33.612 --> 02:36.286
<i>could be a serious threat to us,
my friend.</i>

02:36.653 --> 02:40.482
<i>The Viceroy will not last long
under Jedi interrogation.</i>

02:40.716 --> 02:43.968
I have already put a plan
into action, My Lord.

02:44.577 --> 02:47.344
My best agent, Asajj Ventress,

02:47.469 --> 02:49.592
will infiltrate the Jedi ship

02:49.717 --> 02:52.885
and either free Gunray
or silence him.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.382
<i>Ventress?</i>

02:55.153 --> 02:57.215
<i>You are putting
a great deal of faith</i>

02:57.340 --> 03:00.721
<i>in an operative
who has failed us in the past.</i>

03:00.902 --> 03:02.652
She is a gifted Assassin.

03:02.903 --> 03:04.165
You have my word

03:04.438 --> 03:07.686
she will complete
her mission to the letter.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.855
<i>Very well.</i>

03:09.402 --> 03:11.079
<i>You may proceed.</i>

03:17.090 --> 03:18.090
Master.

03:18.467 --> 03:21.467
There is no margin for error
this time, child.

03:21.592 --> 03:23.633
You must prove yourself

03:23.758 --> 03:26.914
worthy of being my apprentice.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.873
I am worthy,

03:29.042 --> 03:30.572
as you shall see.

03:46.224 --> 03:48.030
How goes the interrogation?

03:48.155 --> 03:50.478
- Has the Viceroy cracked?
- Not yet.

03:50.852 --> 03:54.840
Neimoidians are a slippery lot,
but the Jedi will wear him down.

03:56.590 --> 03:58.740
Your thoughts betray you, Viceroy.

03:59.466 --> 04:01.216
I can sense your concern,

04:01.909 --> 04:04.359
the fear that you will lose
the wealth

04:04.526 --> 04:06.780
and the power
that the war has given you.

04:06.905 --> 04:09.832
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

04:10.153 --> 04:12.089
You hide a great many things:

04:12.214 --> 04:14.264
the names of your secret allies,

04:14.656 --> 04:17.298
the locations of their bases.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.341
I am an innocent pawn
in all of this.

04:20.968 --> 04:24.345
If you're merely a pawn,
then who are you protecting?

04:24.514 --> 04:25.527
No one.

04:25.652 --> 04:27.557
I know nothing.

04:28.117 --> 04:29.592
Liar! Liar!

04:29.717 --> 04:31.519
I'm tired of all this whing.

04:32.215 --> 04:34.355
Tell us what we want
to know right now,

04:34.931 --> 04:38.444
or I will gut you
like a rokarian dirt fish.

04:42.599 --> 04:43.691
Padawan,

04:44.027 --> 04:46.994
terror is not a weapon the Jedi use.

04:47.163 --> 04:48.717
I wasn't serious.

04:48.842 --> 04:51.456
But the only way he'll talk
is if he's scared enough.

04:52.842 --> 04:55.360
Perhaps I was too hasty.

04:55.718 --> 04:57.045
Let us negotiate.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.301
Captain, status report.

05:05.403 --> 05:07.805
Droid fighters incoming.
They've brought boarding ships.

05:18.981 --> 05:21.319
Green company,
prepare to repel the enemy.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.702
<i>Green leader to Commander Gree,</i>

06:10.967 --> 06:13.617
<i>super battle droids
have breached our hull.</i>

06:20.321 --> 06:22.033
They're headed
for the detention level.

06:22.158 --> 06:23.743
We need reinforcements.

06:25.256 --> 06:28.345
- Commander, I'll need your assistance.
- Let's go.

06:29.051 --> 06:32.032
You will stay here
with Captain Argyus.

06:32.157 --> 06:33.934
- Guard the Viceroy.
- But...

06:35.404 --> 06:36.854
As you wish, Master.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.348
It appears you are in no position

06:41.473 --> 06:43.698
to negotiate after all, Padawan.

06:44.078 --> 06:46.970
- Perhaps after my rescue...
- Rescue?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.699
Maybe they're here
to make sure you won't talk.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.886
All units, there's a bomb...

07:12.907 --> 07:14.515
<i>Trooper, what have you found?</i>

07:14.685 --> 07:16.635
<i>Come in, trooper. Do you copy?</i>

07:19.778 --> 07:21.482
<i>Super battle droids are everywhere.</i>

07:21.650 --> 07:25.499
<i>Fall back to the detention level.
We have to protect the prisoner.</i>

08:24.222 --> 08:25.372
See anything?

08:29.509 --> 08:31.007
Engine room seems clear.

08:31.132 --> 08:33.197
- We'll lock it down.
- <i>Good, Captain.</i>

08:33.322 --> 08:35.219
<i>The enemy's advancing
toward the prison level.</i>

08:35.344 --> 08:38.307
We're on our way.
You keep watch here, 327.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.145
Okay, 327T.

08:42.780 --> 08:46.231
You know droids never like
to be called by their nicknames.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.112
There. Looks like
the last of them, General.

09:33.345 --> 09:34.595
Yes, Commander,

09:34.844 --> 09:37.294
but I sense our troubles
are not over.

09:39.842 --> 09:42.830
Sounds like your rescue
didn't work out after all.

09:43.457 --> 09:46.418
I am ready to discuss
our bargain again.

09:46.783 --> 09:49.128
Padawan Tano,
may I have a word?

09:49.719 --> 09:50.880
Certainly, Captain.

09:51.404 --> 09:53.591
If I leave,
you won't go anywhere, will you?

09:55.658 --> 09:57.053
I've got the all-clear.

09:57.223 --> 09:59.013
The enemy has been repelled.

09:59.183 --> 10:02.059
And their attempt
to free Gunray has failed?

10:10.594 --> 10:13.487
If it isn't the hairless harpy.

10:13.785 --> 10:16.502
If it isn't Skywalker's filthy,

10:16.627 --> 10:18.784
obnoxious little pet.

10:19.533 --> 10:21.270
How nice of you.

10:21.687 --> 10:25.082
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you a merciful death.

10:29.508 --> 10:30.795
The Padawan.

10:31.329 --> 10:32.330
Come on.

10:41.461 --> 10:42.307
Shoot her!

10:52.294 --> 10:54.881
Skywalker's not here
to save you now.

10:55.406 --> 10:57.406
Good thing I don't need saving.

11:01.727 --> 11:02.661
Over here!

11:03.096 --> 11:05.538
Open this door,
and I'll buy you a planet.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.136
Yes,

11:19.304 --> 11:21.522
yes, such delicious irony.

11:22.411 --> 11:25.434
How do you like your room now,

11:25.603 --> 11:26.644
youngling?

11:34.284 --> 11:35.443
Halt, assassin.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.161
Surrender.

12:21.596 --> 12:23.157
What are we waiting for?

12:26.660 --> 12:27.454
Thanks.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.624
Everything's running haywire:
doors, lifts.

12:30.969 --> 12:33.209
Communication's down.
Propulsion's dead.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.336
She's crippled the entire ship.

12:35.596 --> 12:37.588
Our attacker has come for Gunray.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.382
Stay here and guard him.

12:39.552 --> 12:41.302
I'll confront her myself.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.786
Master, all due respect,
but Ventress is too powerful

12:45.911 --> 12:49.393
for any one Jedi to fight alone.
Let me help you.

12:49.561 --> 12:53.162
I am more than capable
of dealing with a lone Assassin armed

12:53.287 --> 12:55.607
with undisciplined fighting skills.

12:55.776 --> 12:59.027
- But...
- Stay here and keep a clear head.

13:10.285 --> 13:12.999
Luminara Unduli
may be a Jedi Master,

13:13.167 --> 13:17.045
but she has no idea what that bog witch
is capable of,

13:17.213 --> 13:18.369
no idea.

13:31.408 --> 13:34.376
I can't let her face
that lowlife alone.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.523
Wouldn't we have a better chance
of stopping her if I helped?

13:37.908 --> 13:41.820
Sometimes being a good soldier
means doing what you think is right.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.239
That's why we're superior to droids.

13:50.411 --> 13:53.100
Do you think you'll still be able
to call on the Force

13:53.225 --> 13:56.751
after I've separated
your head from your body?

13:56.919 --> 13:59.160
Even with my vision clouded,

13:59.787 --> 14:01.672
I recognize the fighting style

14:01.841 --> 14:03.163
of Count Dooku.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.552
Your version is unrefined,

14:06.162 --> 14:08.179
amateurish,
sloppy.

14:14.661 --> 14:17.646
I can't disobey a direct order
and leave my post,

14:18.077 --> 14:20.024
- can I?
- I wouldn't.

14:20.432 --> 14:21.358
Don't worry.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.527
We've got this under control,
Master Jedi.

14:23.846 --> 14:25.988
Your friend won't be going anywhere.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.150
All I know is,

14:28.275 --> 14:32.037
I never risk
my own skin if I don't have to.

14:33.409 --> 14:34.246
What?

14:34.970 --> 14:37.541
- Watch him closely.
- You can trust us, Commander.

14:39.277 --> 14:40.920
Call us if you need help, sir.

15:14.567 --> 15:15.712
Now you fall,

15:16.320 --> 15:18.392
as all Jedi must.

15:33.662 --> 15:36.267
I know. I know.
You told me to stay.

15:36.597 --> 15:38.060
Well, as long as you're here.

15:51.240 --> 15:52.659
We have to find her.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.834
We can't let her get to Gunray.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.098
What's that, Captain?

16:10.223 --> 16:11.873
Nothing to worry about.

16:13.910 --> 16:15.422
What are you doing?

16:20.831 --> 16:22.271
No, please don't.

16:25.034 --> 16:26.034
Do shut up.

16:26.159 --> 16:29.036
Count Dooku is paying me a fortune
to deliver your slimyry carcass,

16:29.161 --> 16:31.111
so please, try to stay alive.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.067
What happened to Padawan Tano?

16:59.561 --> 17:00.786
This Assassin,

17:01.197 --> 17:03.732
I've never faced
an adversary like her.

17:04.529 --> 17:06.272
I should have listened
to your advice.

17:06.824 --> 17:09.753
Master, I never meant
to overstep my bounds, but...

17:09.878 --> 17:11.746
<i>General Unduli, we've been betrayed.</i>

17:11.871 --> 17:13.196
<i>Argyus has freed Gunray.</i>

17:14.535 --> 17:15.885
I've been a fool.

17:16.276 --> 17:17.900
Let's get back there.

17:28.924 --> 17:30.637
We'll take her together.

17:39.852 --> 17:41.600
Stop. This is your last warning.

17:41.942 --> 17:44.280
Don't shoot. I am an innocent pawn.

17:44.558 --> 17:45.771
He won't shoot.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.023
He doesn't want to damage his prize.

17:53.196 --> 17:55.614
- Stand down, Captain.
- Come and get me.

18:17.993 --> 18:19.690
Why'd you do it, Argyus?

18:20.036 --> 18:21.724
A clone like you

18:21.893 --> 18:23.476
would never understand.

18:23.759 --> 18:26.984
I wanted a life with more
than empty servitude.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.032
And for that,
you'd betray the Republic?

18:30.235 --> 18:31.929
Like I told the Padawan,

18:32.054 --> 18:33.987
sometimes being a good soldier

18:34.156 --> 18:36.071
means doing what you think is right.

18:41.955 --> 18:45.239
You and I disagree
on what makes a good sol...

18:47.726 --> 18:51.118
You should have taken my offer
when you had the chance,

18:51.504 --> 18:52.512
clone.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.600
The outer shields are still down.

19:24.725 --> 19:27.748
The ship is still in turmoil.
We're home free.

20:05.353 --> 20:08.716
As successful a rescue
as one could hope for, Viceroy.

20:09.414 --> 20:11.264
I will be a legend for this.

20:11.479 --> 20:14.584
I always had a good feeling
about you, Captain.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.183
You see, Assassin?

20:19.598 --> 20:21.426
Our plan went off without a hitch.

20:21.602 --> 20:22.862
Our plan?

20:23.665 --> 20:25.375
And I will, of course,

20:25.500 --> 20:27.666
make sure your contributions
are noted

20:27.791 --> 20:29.641
in my report to Count Dooku.

20:33.352 --> 20:34.902
I'll tell him myself.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.696
Greetings, Viceroy.

20:40.002 --> 20:43.521
I always had a good feeling
about you, Assassin.

20:48.350 --> 20:52.125
I'm sorry that despicable
wealth-worm Gunray got away.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.644
<i>It's okay, snips.</i>

20:53.977 --> 20:55.627
<i>I know you did your best.</i>

20:55.930 --> 20:57.067
Master, I...

20:57.192 --> 21:00.178
<i>Troubling is the treachery
of the Senate guard</i>

21:00.303 --> 21:01.602
<i>Captain Argyus.</i>

21:01.727 --> 21:05.225
<i>Revealed all around us
our enemies are.</i>

21:05.978 --> 21:07.728
I'm not sure all is lost.

21:08.161 --> 21:11.894
Gunray and his accomplices stole
a Republic ship to make their getaway.

21:12.019 --> 21:13.189
<i>It could be tracked.</i>

21:13.314 --> 21:15.811
- Indeed.
- <i>A coward Viceroy Gunray is,</i>

21:16.499 --> 21:18.530
<i>but powerful allies he has.</i>

21:18.916 --> 21:21.866
<i>Swiftly we must move
if we are to recapture him.</i>

21:22.406 --> 21:25.367
Master Fisto's fleet
was near Gunray's position.

21:25.791 --> 21:27.976
I've already contacted him
to follow the signal.

21:28.101 --> 21:30.120
<i>Ahsoka,
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point.</i>

21:30.350 --> 21:31.288
Yes, Master.

21:33.853 --> 21:35.103
Master Luminara,

21:35.413 --> 21:36.960
I guess this is good-bye for now.

21:37.292 --> 21:39.308
I owe you my life, Ahsoka.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.926
Protecting a Jedi Master
is the role of the Padawan.

21:44.228 --> 21:47.078
And teaching is usually
the role of the Master.

21:47.413 --> 21:50.046
Master Skywalker should be proud.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.143
Farewell.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.140
Thank you, Master.

21:57.259 --> 21:59.348
Commander, let's get under way.

21:59.769 --> 22:01.600
Yes, General.
Ahead full.
