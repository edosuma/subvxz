00:31.564 --> 00:35.125
We're gonna be real Rough
Riders in the building.

00:35.468 --> 00:38.665
You know, I ain't stopping until our
high school squad is an All Star squad.

00:38.738 --> 00:40.763
Are you all down? We've
got your back, Lina.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.569
Yeah, girl, we tighter
than a new weave.

00:42.642 --> 00:46.373
Go! Fight! Kill! I mean, win!

00:47.814 --> 00:49.679
<i>Where you going,
cheer-quitas?</i>

00:49.749 --> 00:51.239
The Spirit Championship.

00:51.317 --> 00:53.911
That's where the baddest All
Star squads go to compete.

00:53.987 --> 00:55.614
<i>You don't look like
no All Stars, ma.</i>

00:57.190 --> 01:00.421
Well, we're not.
Yet. But we will be.

01:00.493 --> 01:02.427
Then I guess you
ain't got one of these.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.195
That's an All Star
bracelet. But...

01:07.267 --> 01:10.259
Only the best of the best cheerleaders
win those. How did you get one?

01:10.336 --> 01:12.031
How you think? You
probably stole it.

01:12.105 --> 01:13.367
I know you did.

01:15.475 --> 01:16.464
Whatever.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.462
That's going on right
here. Come on, bring it.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.480
Catalina!

03:06.553 --> 03:07.679
<i>No, mami!</i>

03:08.321 --> 03:09.515
Lina, what are you doing?

03:09.589 --> 03:11.022
<i>She married
the gabacho!</i>

03:25.905 --> 03:28.100
Stop! You're
ruining everything!

03:29.609 --> 03:30.598
Stop!

03:31.844 --> 03:32.868
What's going on here?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.571
Cheer your little
barrio hearts out!

03:35.648 --> 03:38.139
But Lina's coming to live with
me and my daughter in Malibu!

03:47.827 --> 03:48.816
No!

03:55.602 --> 03:57.365
It was just a dream.

03:58.271 --> 04:00.364
It was just a bad dream.

04:05.044 --> 04:06.568
Now the real nightmare begins.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.182
Oh, whoa, whoa.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.120
Let me help you
with that, Wife.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.487
Thank you, Husband.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.854
I know we sound silly, but I'll
never get tired of hearing it.

04:23.663 --> 04:25.756
And I'll never get
tired of saying it.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.091
I'm glad I skipped breakfast.

04:31.971 --> 04:34.201
Lina, you don't have to
go to school today, honey.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.970
Actually, yes, I do. It's
my last day in East LA,

04:37.043 --> 04:39.307
and as captain, I need to
handle some squad business.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.403
I can give you a
ride if you want.

04:40.480 --> 04:42.539
Mmm-mmm. No. I'd rather walk.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.105
Or get dragged by a bus.

04:44.183 --> 04:45.445
Lina, be nice.

04:46.719 --> 04:48.744
Look, I'm gonna be
late. I have to go.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.755
All right. Bye.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.426
Sorry. Oh. No, no,
no. Honey, listen,

04:54.494 --> 04:56.826
you got to give her a
little time. She'll adjust.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.932
Then we'll be one big happy
family. I promise. Okay?

05:21.120 --> 05:24.021
I hate him. And his
daughter, she creeps me out.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.489
<i>She's like way too
Single White Female.</i>

05:26.793 --> 05:29.489
She's probably just mad excited
about having a new sister.

05:30.096 --> 05:32.894
Treyvonetta, come on.
Sky is not my sister.

05:32.965 --> 05:34.830
Not by cheer,
blood or marriage.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.301
I feel you, Lina,
but for real though,

05:37.370 --> 05:40.168
girl, you can't complain
about moving to Malibu.

05:40.239 --> 05:42.730
You about to be living large.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.174
Yeah, right.

05:44.243 --> 05:45.870
Uh-oh. Love birds alert.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.735
Wassup?

05:48.648 --> 05:51.139
Trey and Lina are
here, okay? I got to go.

05:51.217 --> 05:54.152
<i>Come on, mija, you
know I love you.</i>

05:54.520 --> 05:55.714
As much as you love this car?

05:55.788 --> 05:56.914
Hey,

05:57.724 --> 06:00.818
at least she lets me get
under the hood. You don't.

06:01.994 --> 06:02.983
Watch it, girl.

06:03.062 --> 06:04.188
Oh! I will watch it.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.163
You don't want none
of these Golden Gloves.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.563
Get him, G.

06:09.869 --> 06:13.737
Easy, Oscar de la Ha-Ha. And you'd
better not be late picking me up.

06:13.806 --> 06:17.469
What did I tell you about bossing me around
in front of your girly girls like that?

06:17.677 --> 06:19.406
At 4:30, Victor.

06:19.479 --> 06:22.004
You can't tell me what to do.

06:22.482 --> 06:24.143
I'm a man.

06:25.818 --> 06:29.049
I'll be here at 4:15 to
pick up your little pom poms.

06:31.824 --> 06:35.487
Hey, make sure you two watch over
my baby girl for me, all right?

06:35.561 --> 06:37.722
Victor, go. We got this. Go.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.163
In the Gloria-mobile.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.534
This is so messed up, man!

06:45.605 --> 06:49.006
I mean, now we're never gonna get
to be All Stars without you, Lina.

06:49.142 --> 06:51.133
No, no, no. We're
going to be All Stars.

06:51.210 --> 06:53.872
These quickie marriages,
they never last. I'll be back.

06:53.946 --> 06:56.380
Okay, so if you're so
sure you're gonna be back,

06:56.449 --> 06:58.849
then why don't you just
come and stay with me?

06:59.051 --> 07:02.145
Because my mom thinks that
going to school in Malibu

07:02.221 --> 07:03.813
is the best thing that
ever happened to me.

07:03.890 --> 07:08.088
She's like, "You'll get a better education.
It's safe. I won't have to worry."

07:08.594 --> 07:10.960
Seriously, what is
there to worry about?

07:11.030 --> 07:13.521
Besides, this is the first year
our squad is actually tight enough

07:13.599 --> 07:15.533
to become real All Stars.

07:15.601 --> 07:16.727
That's what I'm talking about.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.771
Show everyone we're for real.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.237
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

07:20.306 --> 07:22.399
I want you to be
captain while I'm gone.

07:22.475 --> 07:25.501
Mmm-hmm. Me?
Captain? Yeah. Why?

07:26.345 --> 07:30.543
Because, besides me, like, you
have the most cheer experience.

07:30.650 --> 07:31.844
That is true, G.

07:31.918 --> 07:34.648
You probably came out the
womb like this, "Give me a..."

07:38.157 --> 07:40.057
That looks like me.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.857
But I don't do captain, all
right? I hate being in charge, man.

07:43.930 --> 07:47.297
Whatever, you the one that got Victor
wrapped around your baby finger.

07:47.366 --> 07:49.334
Yeah. I think
you can handle it.

07:49.402 --> 07:51.597
That's because I've got
something Victor wants.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.536
But he ain't gonna get it.

07:53.606 --> 07:56.268
He ain't gonna get it!

07:59.212 --> 08:02.238
Okay, you guys, the new beginning
until the ripple goes like this.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.182
We're gonna change it now. It
starts with the same arm, same leg.

08:05.251 --> 08:07.446
It goes one, two, three,
four. Girls go back on five.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.018
Hit six, six, seven
then eight. Ripple style.

08:12.091 --> 08:14.719
Yeah, let's try that
with the music. Ready?

08:16.596 --> 08:21.659
Five, six, seven, eight. Go one,
two, three, four. Go back, six...

08:24.303 --> 08:25.600
This is a cheer-wreck.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.538
Yeah, our girl is
dying over there.

08:28.608 --> 08:31.008
I feel like a witness
to a cheer-icide.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.736
You think she'll
get better? Hell no.

08:38.384 --> 08:39.373
Really!

08:40.453 --> 08:43.251
Listen, you all need
to drop the attitude,

08:43.322 --> 08:45.847
because while I'm gone,
Gloria is gonna be the captain.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.188
Okay, it's like that, huh?

08:51.731 --> 08:53.358
That's not very captain-like.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.263
Oh! I'm sorry. My bad.

08:57.236 --> 09:01.935
Look, if we want to be All Stars, then
we need to practice like All Stars. Okay?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.269
Now let's do this. Line up.

09:06.078 --> 09:07.375
Yeah, okay. Keep it loose.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.243
Oh! This ought to be good.
Charmaine, don't forget,

09:09.315 --> 09:11.044
pop on six, not seven.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.677
Five, six, seven,
eight. Music.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.287
Right. Okay.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.761
Remember, All Stars,
that's what we want.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.534
Yes. Yes.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.545
All right. Pick it up.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.709
Okay, this is tight.
This is tight, ladies.

09:49.221 --> 09:50.552
Now, out!

09:51.724 --> 09:53.055
In you go, hard.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.928
That was hot. Go.

10:00.299 --> 10:01.561
Bring it in.

10:02.101 --> 10:03.432
Come on.

10:08.741 --> 10:12.074
East LA! East LA!
East LA! East LA!

10:12.445 --> 10:15.778
East LA! East LA!
East LA! East LA!

10:17.116 --> 10:18.242
In your face.

10:18.317 --> 10:21.218
But they couldn't do
that five minutes ago.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.017
What's this? Just
a little something

10:28.094 --> 10:29.721
so you won't forget us.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.253
Come on, guys, I can't forget
you. You're my cheer sisters.

10:41.941 --> 10:43.909
I miss you guys already.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.543
Come back soon, you
know, Lina. Real soon.

10:50.016 --> 10:53.076
<i>Catalina, mi amor, mi
amor. It's time to go.</i>

11:11.370 --> 11:14.032
East Los. Forever.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.537
Don't forget us,
Lina. We love you.

11:49.308 --> 11:52.607
So, how many
families live here?

11:52.678 --> 11:55.010
One. But it just
doubled in size.

11:55.214 --> 11:59.947
<i>Now, listen, I want you both to feel really
comfortable here. Mi casa es su casa.</i>

12:00.519 --> 12:01.508
Thanks, Enrique.

12:01.587 --> 12:03.748
Come on, that's not how
Henry pronounces his name.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.154
It's okay. She can call
me whatever she wants.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.021
Really? Well how about...

12:08.527 --> 12:10.085
Only if you can
say it in church.

12:10.162 --> 12:12.187
Well that's really gonna
limit my vocabulary.

12:26.645 --> 12:27.634
Wow!

12:28.814 --> 12:30.304
This is my room?

12:38.591 --> 12:41.287
I don't think I
belong here, you guys.

12:45.865 --> 12:46.889
Oh...

12:46.966 --> 12:48.627
Oh. No. Now that's bootleg.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.193
How are they gonna have a broken
toilet right next to a new one?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.200
It's not a toilet,
Lina. It's a bidet.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.571
A... What?

12:59.411 --> 13:00.400
A bidet.

13:01.947 --> 13:02.971
You use it to wash your...

13:03.048 --> 13:04.515
No, no, no.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.016
That's nasty. How...

13:06.719 --> 13:10.621
I don't even drink out of a public
fountain. You expect me to use that?

13:10.689 --> 13:12.680
Oh! I told Dad you were funny.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.625
Thanks, Sky, but your
dad doesn't know me.

13:15.694 --> 13:18.219
He doesn't really even
know my mother, either.

13:18.297 --> 13:21.824
Maybe, but I don't
think it really matters.

13:22.835 --> 13:25.929
He said with Isabel, it
was love at first sight.

13:27.106 --> 13:30.405
<i>You mean first he saw her culata.
And then he saw her tetas.</i>

13:31.377 --> 13:32.366
What?

13:32.812 --> 13:33.801
Nothing.

13:34.413 --> 13:40.113
Anyway, we're sisters now. I
have always wanted a sister.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.684
It's gonna to take more than a marriage
license to be considered sisters.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.323
Yeah, I know that.

13:49.595 --> 13:51.654
Even the Brady
Bunch had issues.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.357
Right.

13:53.432 --> 13:56.868
Anyway, I'm supposed to
tell you dinner's ready.

13:58.871 --> 14:02.534
You know what, I'm good. I'm actually
kind of tired. It's been a long day.

14:02.608 --> 14:03.802
Okay.

14:05.077 --> 14:06.567
Unfortunately.

14:25.497 --> 14:27.727
Remember, work on the sync
in the table top combination

14:27.800 --> 14:30.098
and make sure that Trey
sticks her full back.

14:30.169 --> 14:31.534
Yeah, okay. No problem.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.403
Hey, what's it like there?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.731
<i>Lifestyles of the
Rich and Annoying.</i>

14:39.345 --> 14:41.370
You have to see this!

14:42.047 --> 14:44.413
This girl's room is
like a cheer-seum.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.449
Her mother won
championships three times!

14:49.655 --> 14:53.056
<i>Wow! Oye, guey, that girl must
have cheerleading in her blood.</i>

14:53.125 --> 14:55.457
From what I've seen, I think
it skipped a generation.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.620
Looking for me?
Girl, I got to go.

14:58.964 --> 15:00.761
Is this you and your mom?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.163
Yeah. Wow.

15:05.971 --> 15:08.371
She must have been an
amazing cheerleader.

15:09.074 --> 15:12.441
Don't! I really don't like
people touching her stuff.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.569
Sorry. It's fine.

15:15.581 --> 15:18.641
It's no problem. Here.

15:21.186 --> 15:22.551
Okay. Come on.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.613
You don't want to be late
for your first day of school.

15:25.691 --> 15:28.387
Right, because being the
new kid is so much fun.

15:31.030 --> 15:34.591
Yeah. So the pool and the
stadium are over there.

15:35.267 --> 15:39.169
And you can get vegan
or sushi for lunch.

15:39.338 --> 15:40.327
And...

15:40.906 --> 15:41.930
Oh.

15:42.007 --> 15:46.637
That's the Tai Chi class, which
doesn't count for PE credit.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.606
Go figure.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.114
Who are they?

15:56.188 --> 15:57.849
Malibu Jaguars.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.090
All Star squad.

16:00.159 --> 16:02.059
They belong to the cheerleading
gym across the street,

16:02.127 --> 16:05.426
but unfortunately some
of them go to school here.

16:05.764 --> 16:09.598
The Jaguars? They won the
Spirit Championship last year.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.234
Avery's the captain.

16:11.337 --> 16:15.000
Now, she's a hater.
A Sea Lion hater.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.505
Why?

16:16.575 --> 16:21.569
She used to be one of us but we
didn't vote her captain, so she quit.

16:22.481 --> 16:25.075
She took all of our best
cheerleaders with her.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.412
Hey, you just can't
just walk up to them.

16:29.321 --> 16:30.720
Watch me.

16:31.623 --> 16:32.851
Avery?

16:34.693 --> 16:38.959
The Jaguars were sick last
year at the Spirit Championship.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.932
I'm sorry, no
autographs today.

16:42.434 --> 16:46.131
No, look, look, I'm not
a groupie. I'm Catalina.

16:46.205 --> 16:49.265
My East LA squad is like this
close to becoming All Stars, too.

16:49.341 --> 16:52.777
Wow! And I'm like
this close to caring.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.178
I bet you'll care when we take that
bracelet away from you this year.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.807
Cute.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.251
But then you'd
have to beat us.

17:00.319 --> 17:01.843
And that's just not happening.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.683
Like her outfit.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.287
Was I talking to you?

17:06.358 --> 17:07.619
Excuse me.

17:07.693 --> 17:11.424
No, no, no. No time
for cat fights, Kayla.

17:11.497 --> 17:13.727
As a matter of fact, Cat,

17:14.867 --> 17:18.826
why don't you go back to
East LA? Just go south,

17:18.936 --> 17:21.531
and when you start to
smell poverty, you're home.

17:21.607 --> 17:26.374
Excuse me, but, Lina,
she lives here now.

17:26.444 --> 17:31.280
Wait. Your mother's that Mexican
maid who married Sky's daddy.

17:31.350 --> 17:32.749
She doesn't look Mexican.

17:32.818 --> 17:35.412
For your information,
we're Cuban-American.

17:35.487 --> 17:36.647
Fascinating.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.349
And my mother was a waitress.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.114
A maid with tips.

17:41.093 --> 17:44.790
You know, y'all are lucky that my girls are
not here, because if they were here, we...

17:44.863 --> 17:48.128
You know what, save
the urban drama, Cat.

17:48.267 --> 17:50.599
After all, you're
the lucky one.

17:51.170 --> 17:54.901
I mean, you got to meet
real All Stars today.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.973
They give Malibu-Americans
a bad name.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.693
And guess what. Game
over. We won by two.

18:20.365 --> 18:21.855
Oh! That's gross.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.266
I'm sorry. And you are?

18:24.336 --> 18:25.598
Lina. Who are you?

18:25.671 --> 18:28.606
I'm surprised you
have to ask. I'm Evan.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.074
Well, Evan, you have a booger.

18:31.877 --> 18:32.866
Uh...

18:51.864 --> 18:52.853
Hi.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.164
So, we just figured
out your style.

18:56.268 --> 19:00.068
So are these old clothes? Are
they supposed to be vintage?

19:00.672 --> 19:03.664
No, more like
homeless couture.

19:03.742 --> 19:06.870
Look, I don't care what
you label whores think.

19:06.945 --> 19:08.139
Where I'm from, this is tight.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.475
But you're here now,

19:09.648 --> 19:11.843
and you kind of stand
out like bad teeth.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.646
Look, if you guys want
to take this outside,

19:13.719 --> 19:15.016
we can do this.

19:15.087 --> 19:16.645
Hold up, jalapeno.

19:16.722 --> 19:20.385
Yeah, Cat. You know, it's one
thing to be a fashion don't,

19:20.959 --> 19:26.090
but unless you want them to
give you a permanent facial,

19:26.732 --> 19:28.427
don't threaten me.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.371
You must be Lina.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.242
Yeah, and who are you?

19:42.314 --> 19:47.251
I'm Sky's friend, Christina.
Yeah, we're on the squad together.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.081
You're a cheerleader?

19:49.154 --> 19:50.746
Go Sea Lions.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.615
Look, no offense, but you sound
like you've had a cheer-botomy.

19:55.661 --> 19:59.927
How come people always say "No
offense" right before they offend you?

20:02.301 --> 20:03.825
Look, it's been a...

20:03.902 --> 20:08.896
No offense, Lina, but
you're just like them.

20:38.036 --> 20:39.025
Hey, Lina.

20:39.104 --> 20:41.834
Tell me you guys nailed the Liberty
combination! We have to hit every stunt.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.371
Lina, Hold on. Victor,
enough with the up and down.

20:47.446 --> 20:51.576
You really want to see my
up and down? Okay, babe.

20:52.684 --> 20:53.742
Girl, we got a problem.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.748
No. Don't tell me that, Gloria.
Step up! Make them practice harder.

20:56.955 --> 20:57.944
I did, but...

20:58.023 --> 20:59.854
Motivate them! Inspire them!

21:00.025 --> 21:03.791
There's nobody left to inspire,
all right? Everybody quit.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.360
I mean, of course,
except Trey.

21:05.497 --> 21:08.591
My team quit? Why?

21:08.667 --> 21:10.965
Because. Lina, I'm not you.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.367
All right? And they
don't think that

21:12.437 --> 21:15.736
<i>I can make them All Stars, and
honestly, neither do I. I'm sorry.</i>

21:16.108 --> 21:19.407
It's okay. I know
you... I know you tried.

21:19.478 --> 21:20.911
I really did.

21:22.914 --> 21:26.941
But, hey, it's not all bad, you know.
You still get to be Princess Lina.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.850
Living in Malibu.

21:29.588 --> 21:30.577
Jaguars!

21:34.226 --> 21:37.389
<i>It ain't all good
here, mi hermana.</i>

21:37.596 --> 21:40.963
Look, I got to
bounce. My bus is here.

21:43.635 --> 21:44.829
She just hung up.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.510
Sorry about your team.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.346
I'll deal with it later.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.041
Sure.

22:01.353 --> 22:06.290
But if you wanna keep up your skills until
then, we have a spot on the Sea Lions.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.388
Are you serious?

22:08.493 --> 22:11.951
My squad ain't even cold yet and
you're already cheer-jocking me?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.466
You're right.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.891
I'm so sorry. I...

22:27.412 --> 22:29.710
Why did you say that to Sky?

22:30.315 --> 22:33.011
Why? It's not like
she's my real sister.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.842
At least in East
LA I had family.

22:34.920 --> 22:36.911
You have family
here now, too, Lina.

22:36.988 --> 22:39.388
And Sky's been through
so much already.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.892
How would you feel
if you lost me?

22:44.196 --> 22:47.222
All right, I guess
I'll try to be nicer.

22:47.299 --> 22:49.358
You're gonna do a
lot more than try.

22:49.768 --> 22:51.827
You're gonna be
joining the Sea Lions.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.594
Trying out, huh?

23:18.864 --> 23:22.356
No, just checking things out.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.326
That's cool.

23:24.636 --> 23:27.867
You know, they kind of
suck after my sister quit.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.933
No. You're Avery's brother?

23:32.744 --> 23:33.904
Not in her fan club, huh?

23:33.979 --> 23:38.177
I'm starting my own club. It's called
the League of Avery Can Kiss My Butt.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.447
Yeah? Well, you won't
be the only member.

23:43.789 --> 23:47.281
You know, every pretty girl
doesn't have to be a cheerleader.

23:47.559 --> 23:49.493
I mean, the stuff they
do is way hard anyway.

23:49.561 --> 23:50.550
It's not that hard.

23:50.629 --> 23:51.755
Oh. No?

23:51.830 --> 23:54.196
Okay, that's easy for a
non-cheerleader to say.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.255
Okay.

23:56.468 --> 23:59.266
So what's your
thing? You play ball?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.732
Maybe. Think you can step?

24:04.443 --> 24:05.740
Here, take a shot. Really.

24:05.811 --> 24:08.575
No, no, no, really
this time. Go ahead.

24:09.414 --> 24:11.314
Okay. Go ahead. Right there.

24:16.822 --> 24:17.982
I'm so sorry.

24:18.056 --> 24:19.387
Sorry, coach.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.425
You think I'm a
klutz, don't you?

24:22.494 --> 24:23.893
Maybe a little.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.426
Come here.

24:28.900 --> 24:30.492
This is how you shoot.

24:35.106 --> 24:36.767
That's it.

24:38.910 --> 24:40.309
It's perfect.

24:42.881 --> 24:44.371
Peep this.

24:44.449 --> 24:45.541
Okay.

24:53.859 --> 24:55.724
Lina! Hey, you came!

25:41.206 --> 25:43.265
Good news. You made the team.

25:43.341 --> 25:45.172
Let's face it,
she is the team.

25:45.243 --> 25:46.710
And we voted you team captain.

25:48.179 --> 25:49.305
But you're captain.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.714
Yeah. By default, and I suck.

25:52.784 --> 25:54.649
But you are really good.

25:54.719 --> 25:55.708
Yeah.

25:55.787 --> 25:56.981
You could fix us.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.546
You know, I thought
I can do this, but no.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.091
Come on. Come on.

26:01.159 --> 26:03.525
Use your powers for good.

26:03.595 --> 26:07.053
I mean, we do cheer at,
like, all of Evan's games.

26:07.599 --> 26:08.623
Yeah.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.725
So? I don't care about him.

26:10.802 --> 26:12.201
Right.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.740
We'll pretend like
we believe that.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.977
Please, Lina, we will work really hard.
Because we could be really good. I promise.

26:20.045 --> 26:21.478
I'd settle for upright.

26:21.546 --> 26:22.843
Good luck with that.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.142
We still have to
fill another spot.

26:24.215 --> 26:28.174
You could fill it with whoever you want
to. It could be somebody good. I just...

26:30.322 --> 26:32.449
Yeah? Like who?

26:33.325 --> 26:34.690
You swear to help me out?

26:34.759 --> 26:37.785
I will do whatever it takes.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.066
Okay, I'm in.

26:56.481 --> 26:57.505
Yes? Can I help you?

26:57.582 --> 26:59.573
Lina!

27:02.787 --> 27:05.017
Meet the newest
member of our squad.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.285
Go, Sea Crabs! Sea Lions.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.562
You said to make
more of an effort.

27:11.630 --> 27:15.225
<i>Oye, guey, you got
one smoking casa!</i>

27:16.801 --> 27:17.825
Thank you.

27:17.902 --> 27:22.032
Okay. Henry's kindness is no excuse
for you to take advantage of him, Lina!

27:22.173 --> 27:23.572
Not even a little?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.906
<i>Gloria, tu mama, she must
be worried about you.</i>

27:26.811 --> 27:28.403
I almost forgot.

27:32.117 --> 27:36.076
She's got to go to work, but she'll
call you in the morning to thank you.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.746
I have a boyfriend.

27:37.822 --> 27:41.451
Mama thinks this is like putting me
in the Virginity Protection Program.

27:41.893 --> 27:44.760
You do realize that there's
a waiting list at MV, right?

27:44.829 --> 27:48.265
Dad, can't you, like,
dialog with the principal?

27:48.333 --> 27:50.927
Dialog? Please tell me you're
not teaching her hood talk.

27:51.002 --> 27:54.199
Come on, Dad. Strings
get pulled all the time.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.830
George Bush got
into Yale, didn't he?

27:56.908 --> 27:59.672
Come on. No
cheerleader left behind.

28:01.312 --> 28:04.179
Please, Daddy? Please.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.744
She used the "Daddy"
card. She's good.

28:10.321 --> 28:11.310
All right.

28:16.327 --> 28:17.316
Thank you. Thank you.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.765
Five, six, seven, eight.

28:32.744 --> 28:34.609
Are those the Mountain Lions?

28:34.679 --> 28:38.410
It's the Sea Lions. And
no, those are the Jaguars.

28:45.056 --> 28:49.516
No. That was a
big bowl of wrong!

28:50.995 --> 28:51.984
Yeah.

28:54.699 --> 28:57.361
Looks like Dora the
Explorer has a new pal.

28:58.837 --> 29:02.068
Seriously, Cat,
you're like a stalker.

29:02.474 --> 29:05.705
Don't you have anything else,
I don't know, better to do?

29:06.344 --> 29:10.644
Better than watching you sweat
off a spray tan? Yes, I do.

29:10.715 --> 29:13.843
As a matter of fact, I'm
going to Sea Lion practice.

29:14.285 --> 29:16.082
They voted me captain.

29:16.287 --> 29:19.950
And you're bragging about
it. What a cheer-barrassment.

29:21.059 --> 29:24.654
Don't act like you didn't want to be
the captain of the Sea Lions, Avery.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.263
That was way back when
I was into charity.

29:28.767 --> 29:30.735
I'm so over that.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.030
Over.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.030
You're a big muscular girl.

29:35.940 --> 29:37.464
Are you gonna practice
with the Sea Lions, too?

29:37.542 --> 29:39.305
Or just bench press them?

29:40.512 --> 29:45.677
Wait, wait, wait.
She said you have

29:46.251 --> 29:49.846
<i>grande muscles.
Strong like bull.</i>

29:49.921 --> 29:51.047
Oh...

29:51.122 --> 29:54.216
I'm bilingual. Right?
I speak bitch, too.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.489
<i>You got them right, man.
Cheer-brujas. Mean and bony.</i>

29:58.797 --> 30:00.230
Better than fat. Let's go.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.560
You know... In a sec.

30:01.866 --> 30:04.027
But your girls, they're
coming in too early.

30:04.335 --> 30:06.565
They need to hold
on one, and then...

30:13.511 --> 30:17.277
Right. Now train your
little Sea Lions to do that.

30:17.348 --> 30:20.010
Then maybe I'll be impressed.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.247
I'd rather be a Sea Lion,
if this is the best you got.

30:23.354 --> 30:28.018
<i>So, Cat, I'm guessing your little amiga
hasn't seen the rest of the pod squad yet.</i>

30:28.092 --> 30:29.116
Has she?

30:31.763 --> 30:32.889
They're really good. Really.

30:32.964 --> 30:34.454
Really good.

30:34.532 --> 30:37.000
Your Sea Otters
got skills, right?

30:45.143 --> 30:46.906
They have potential.

30:46.978 --> 30:48.912
Really? Where do they keep it?

30:52.050 --> 30:54.109
Why is that girl dancing
with her tongue out?

30:54.185 --> 30:56.619
She said it helps
her concentrate.

30:56.921 --> 31:00.914
I used to have a dog who did
that. He couldn't cheer either.

31:01.326 --> 31:06.229
Okay. All right, I know it's bad, but,
Christina, she's got tumbling skills

31:06.297 --> 31:09.061
and Sky has spirit.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.727
And don't forget her mom
won, like, every award.

31:12.804 --> 31:15.534
Like, deep down, she's got
cheerleading in her gut!

31:16.808 --> 31:19.140
Too bad it's not in
her brain or muscles.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.773
We've got some work to do.

31:21.846 --> 31:22.938
Yeah.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.140
Six, seven, eight.

31:24.215 --> 31:25.477
One, two, three...
Load it out.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.539
Load it out.

31:26.618 --> 31:27.676
...four, five,
six, seven, eight.

31:27.752 --> 31:29.447
One, two, three, four.

31:30.255 --> 31:31.916
High knees. High knees.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.350
Six. You ain't cute.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.019
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.326
Hey! Hey.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.150
Four, five, six. One.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.020
Are you okay?

32:12.096 --> 32:13.358
You all right, man?

32:14.365 --> 32:16.765
I'd rather eat
underwear and die.

32:17.035 --> 32:20.698
Sweaty, day-old,
butt-wedgie underwear.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.843
Whitney, come back!

32:30.014 --> 32:34.144
She was one of our best dancers. I
mean, I know that's not saying much,

32:34.218 --> 32:37.119
but what are we
supposed to do now?

32:41.292 --> 32:42.782
I've got an idea.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.303
In the house!

33:03.314 --> 33:06.750
<i>This is nice! You all
should go on Cribs.</i>

33:07.018 --> 33:09.509
Hey, I'm Treyvonetta.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.551
Girl, how many
bedrooms you all got?

33:13.191 --> 33:15.591
Six bedrooms and
seven and a half baths.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.087
We can each have
own our own suite.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.651
Nice! Sweet!

33:20.298 --> 33:21.663
I'll show you a tour.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.936
Okay, Gloria, Trey and I are
gonna break it down for you. Okay?

33:32.076 --> 33:34.169
Five, six, seven, eight.

33:34.245 --> 33:38.238
One, two, three and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

33:38.316 --> 33:42.184
One, two, three and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

33:42.253 --> 33:46.189
One and two, three and four.
Five, six and roll it out.

33:46.257 --> 33:49.021
One, two, three and give it.

33:49.093 --> 33:52.324
I feel so white.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.497
Me, too. Like
Clay Aiken white.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.464
Okay, okay. Come on, get up.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.868
You know, rhythm has no color.
You know, just shake and jive.

34:00.938 --> 34:02.633
Gonna have some fun.
That's right! Come on.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.002
Shake what your mama gave you.

34:04.075 --> 34:09.034
I mean, we just could keep the old
routine until, like, after the game.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.737
Or until we graduate.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.011
Look, you want this school
to respect you, right?

34:14.085 --> 34:15.143
Yeah. Yeah.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.550
Then you need to
respect yourselves.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.521
Which means you need to
improve on your skills.

34:18.589 --> 34:22.753
That's right. So let's
drop it like it's hot.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.795
Hit it, girl. Take notes.

34:26.630 --> 34:32.159
Yeah. Is there an easier version
that's maybe, like, lukewarm?

34:33.670 --> 34:36.036
Sky, this is the easy version.

34:36.107 --> 34:37.505
Now, come on, Sea Lions.

34:38.976 --> 34:40.603
You can do this.
That's right, come on.

34:40.678 --> 34:41.975
All right. Get into formation.

34:52.723 --> 34:54.953
Gloria, look who's here.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.186
Victor!

34:58.396 --> 34:59.488
Victor!

35:01.732 --> 35:03.700
You came all the way
out here to see me.

35:03.768 --> 35:05.258
<i>You're my chulita.</i>

35:05.336 --> 35:07.167
I'd follow you anywhere.

35:07.705 --> 35:09.036
That's sweet.

35:09.740 --> 35:11.332
Can you spot me
a twenty for gas?

35:11.409 --> 35:12.671
No!

35:13.444 --> 35:14.604
Damn!

35:16.180 --> 35:17.875
Yo, who's this?

35:19.584 --> 35:23.452
I'm Sky. It's a
pleasure to meet you.

35:24.922 --> 35:27.220
So you're Lina's sister
from another mister.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.088
I haven't thought of it like
that. No, no. Not really.

35:29.760 --> 35:33.059
Hey, Lina. Who is that dude
over there checking you out?

35:33.764 --> 35:34.753
Oh!

35:34.866 --> 35:36.231
Go ahead, Lina.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.562
That boy's finer
than baby hair.

35:37.635 --> 35:39.626
Whatever. He's just some guy.

35:39.704 --> 35:44.038
Yeah, right. Evan's, like,
the most popular guy in school.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.367
Please. I'm not impressed.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.571
Lina, if Malibu
Ken is sweating you,

35:50.515 --> 35:53.575
I can put that fool
in check, real quick.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.049
Look at this guy.
Look at this guy.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.985
<i>Go get him,
papi. You go!</i>

35:59.891 --> 36:01.085
Do that.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.319
What's happening?

36:02.393 --> 36:03.587
He's a mess.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.497
What's up, bro?

36:10.568 --> 36:12.001
Dude, is that your ride?

36:12.069 --> 36:16.768
Yeah, foo, cherried-out,
top of the line hydraulics.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.340
What do you know
about that, beach boy?

36:20.912 --> 36:22.209
She's a head turner.

36:22.780 --> 36:24.407
All right. Check this out.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.310
I hope he doesn't
scare him too much.

36:26.384 --> 36:27.442
He'll be good.

36:30.087 --> 36:32.681
He's supposed to scare
him, not be all lovey-dovey.

36:32.757 --> 36:33.985
What?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.716
She's pimped to the max.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.124
Thanks, man.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.858
You know, that's tight you
know how we roll in East Los.

36:41.065 --> 36:42.191
I'm Victor.

36:42.266 --> 36:43.392
Evan.

36:43.901 --> 36:45.869
What... They look like
they're about to hug.

36:47.405 --> 36:48.565
They're hugging.

36:48.639 --> 36:52.234
Dude, that's what happens when you send
a Chihuahua to do the job of a pit bull.

36:52.310 --> 36:55.473
So, what's up, Evan? You
trying to push up on Lina?

36:55.546 --> 36:56.979
Dude, I'm trying.

36:57.248 --> 36:59.546
But I swear, every time I step
to her, I say something stupid.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.312
So, I don't know
how well it's going.

37:01.385 --> 37:05.219
<i>Bro, you just got to know
how to handle these chicas.</i>

37:05.289 --> 37:06.950
You got to be in
charge, homie. Yeah.

37:07.024 --> 37:10.516
They love that. Come on, man.
I'll show you how it's done.

37:11.128 --> 37:13.255
Come on. Come on, man.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.355
Wait, wait, wait. Why
are they coming over here?

37:15.433 --> 37:16.957
Wait. Quick, quick,
quick. Lip check.

37:17.034 --> 37:19.025
Lip Smacker. Here.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.092
Perfect. Watermelon.

37:21.739 --> 37:22.728
Thanks.

37:25.042 --> 37:26.839
Gloria... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

37:26.911 --> 37:30.711
Let's roll out. Evan here
wants to holla' at your girl.

37:30.781 --> 37:32.180
Okay. Are you cool?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.308
Yes, whatever.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.343
Okay. We'll wait
for you in the car.

37:36.420 --> 37:37.444
Mmm-hmm.

37:37.521 --> 37:39.512
Quit staring. Come on.

37:45.529 --> 37:47.588
See, that's how you do it.

37:48.399 --> 37:49.866
Come on.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.334
So... So...

37:52.403 --> 37:53.870
We should hang out.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.098
Yeah, right.

37:55.172 --> 37:57.538
Your sister would freak out if
she saw us hanging out together.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.168
Come on. Let her
freak. It's nothing new.

38:00.244 --> 38:02.109
Okay. Yeah?

38:02.179 --> 38:04.443
Maybe. I'll think about it.

38:05.516 --> 38:07.711
Okay. I'll see you
at the game tomorrow.

38:07.985 --> 38:09.475
Yes, you will.

39:21.258 --> 39:23.123
Get up, get up, quick.
Give me your hand.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.221
They're even worse than
they were before. I love it.

39:27.631 --> 39:30.156
I knew this would be worth
being late for practice.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.698
Let's put them out
of their misery.

39:38.976 --> 39:40.102
Jaguars.

39:47.318 --> 39:48.785
We can't just walk out.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.348
Hell, no.

39:50.721 --> 39:51.779
Come on.

40:29.660 --> 40:30.820
Jaguars! Jaguars!

40:32.096 --> 40:37.432
If you want to win, yell with all your
might! When we say "Go," you say "Fight!"

40:37.501 --> 40:38.729
Go! Fight!

40:38.803 --> 40:40.065
Go! Fight!

40:40.171 --> 40:42.537
Malibu Vista!

40:48.979 --> 40:50.173
This is Sea Lion territory.

40:50.247 --> 40:52.681
Don't ever shake your conceited
Jag butt over here again.

40:52.750 --> 40:57.153
Excuse me. Then who's supposed to show
our school what a real squad looks like?

40:57.221 --> 40:59.348
Not this mariachi band.

40:59.423 --> 41:01.254
You're so lucky I found Jesus.

41:01.325 --> 41:03.225
Hey, hey, hey. Okay?
I didn't use my hands.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.626
All right. But you can't
fight girls like this.

41:06.096 --> 41:07.893
They press charges. Right.

41:08.766 --> 41:10.028
Run away.

41:16.707 --> 41:17.833
Jaguars.

41:24.815 --> 41:26.146
Emergency practice session?

41:26.217 --> 41:27.309
Yes. As long as it takes.

41:27.585 --> 41:30.713
Lina. Look, I'm
sorry about my sister.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.187
She's... Forgotten.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.155
Okay. Works for me.

41:35.226 --> 41:37.854
Why is your brother talking
to Miss Chiquita Banana?

41:38.329 --> 41:41.321
He's always dating down.
But don't you worry.

41:41.866 --> 41:42.924
I'll fix it.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.557
You know, I need to take
care of some team stuff.

41:44.635 --> 41:45.624
Yeah.

41:45.903 --> 41:48.565
I would, too, if my team
got spanked like that. I'd...

41:52.243 --> 41:55.007
I mean, I'll just
catch up with you later.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.416
Okay. I see the little wheels
turning in your evil little head.

42:05.489 --> 42:06.888
What you thinking?

42:06.957 --> 42:08.447
That we're outnumbered
and unarmed.

42:09.627 --> 42:12.824
If we were surrounded by all these
people back home, what would we do?

42:12.897 --> 42:14.865
<i>Pretend to no
habla ingles?</i>

42:14.932 --> 42:16.729
Use our white voices?

42:17.034 --> 42:18.194
No.

42:18.669 --> 42:20.330
Call for backup.

42:20.404 --> 42:21.666
Honestly, I was gonna say run.

42:21.939 --> 42:23.406
But let's do that.

42:23.474 --> 42:25.305
Guys, I know exactly
what we need to do.

42:48.365 --> 42:51.459
Lina, I don't think
this was a good idea.

42:55.439 --> 42:57.464
How do they move
their bodies like that?

42:57.541 --> 43:00.908
Don't be scared, Sky. Look,
I got you looking good.

43:00.978 --> 43:03.776
This is impromptu flavor
school for you guys.

43:03.847 --> 43:05.337
We're about to
loosen you guys up.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.607
What do you mean?

43:10.354 --> 43:11.582
You'll see.

43:22.299 --> 43:23.960
What's wrong now?

43:25.603 --> 43:29.801
Nothing. I just
realized something.

43:30.941 --> 43:33.603
I just realized Lina
already has two sisters.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.175
She doesn't need me.

43:37.648 --> 43:40.742
Come on, you're being so
Betty Buzzkill right now.

43:40.818 --> 43:45.619
I know you better than anyone else and it
seems to me like you both need each other.

43:45.689 --> 43:47.384
I have homework.
I should go home.

43:47.458 --> 43:48.686
Sky?

43:52.763 --> 43:55.231
<i>Man, you look hot.
Dance with me, chulita.</i>

43:56.266 --> 43:57.597
Okay.

43:57.668 --> 43:58.760
Christina?

44:00.804 --> 44:04.604
I have a 4.0 GPA. Leave
me alone, Betty Buzzkill.

44:18.722 --> 44:19.814
Yeah.

44:24.762 --> 44:25.922
Yeah, baby.

44:34.004 --> 44:35.801
Sky, want to dance?

44:35.873 --> 44:36.999
No, thanks.

44:37.074 --> 44:38.268
Come on. No, I'm good.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.570
You know you want to.

44:39.643 --> 44:41.634
No, I'm good right
here. Thank you.

44:45.616 --> 44:46.742
Sky!

44:50.187 --> 44:52.519
Sky, come on. Let's go.

44:56.660 --> 44:58.958
Sky's in the house.

44:59.563 --> 45:03.226
Come on, girl. Don't be
scared. Shake it. Yeah.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.195
Come on, make us proud, Sky.

45:14.344 --> 45:15.936
Look at those hips.

45:17.114 --> 45:18.274
All right.

45:25.022 --> 45:26.148
Lina.

45:31.161 --> 45:32.992
You know, it's
called stalking, Evan.

45:33.063 --> 45:34.155
Yeah?

45:34.965 --> 45:38.901
Let me guess. Your new friend
Victor told you I'd be here.

45:39.069 --> 45:40.661
Yeah, maybe.

45:40.838 --> 45:44.467
You know, but I cannot believe you didn't
invite me to your little party yourself.

45:44.541 --> 45:47.908
I mean, especially after I told
everyone how much I like you.

45:47.978 --> 45:49.309
It's just rude.

45:49.379 --> 45:50.641
You did not.

45:51.982 --> 45:53.973
No, but I will.

45:55.853 --> 45:57.650
Are you always this corny?

45:58.355 --> 45:59.481
You just make me nervous.

45:59.556 --> 46:01.387
Me? Yeah.

46:01.458 --> 46:03.085
Why? You're Mr. Popularity.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.457
Come on.

46:04.528 --> 46:08.794
That's what those other kids see me
as. But you don't. And I dig that.

46:16.707 --> 46:20.268
Christina, why can't
we be more like them?

46:21.879 --> 46:24.507
Because we took
a purity pledge.

46:25.215 --> 46:28.912
But that doesn't mean we can't be
more cool and hot like they are.

46:29.787 --> 46:30.879
I guess.

46:32.723 --> 46:33.712
Uh-oh.

46:35.759 --> 46:37.158
Yo, what you looking at?

46:37.227 --> 46:38.888
Who, me?

46:39.596 --> 46:41.689
Nothing. Are you
calling my girl nothing?

46:41.799 --> 46:43.664
I saw the way you
was looking at her.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.133
What way? There was a way?

46:45.402 --> 46:49.270
No, there's no way.
I was just looking.

46:49.373 --> 46:51.534
So you admit you
was looking at me.

46:51.608 --> 46:53.473
All right, I'm gonna show
you something to look at.

46:53.544 --> 46:58.038
Wait. You want to fight
me because I looked at you?

46:58.115 --> 47:00.709
What, did you think you could just
look at my girl and get away with it?

47:00.784 --> 47:02.513
Uh-uh. We don't
play that here.

47:02.586 --> 47:04.554
Christina, do something.

47:05.923 --> 47:07.914
Lina! Lina! Help!

47:12.496 --> 47:14.259
They're gonna kill Sky!

47:14.331 --> 47:16.629
Wait, hold up. Wait,
what's the problem?

47:17.134 --> 47:18.965
I don't know. I mean, I
was just looking at her.

47:19.036 --> 47:20.333
And then she came
down the stairs and...

47:21.638 --> 47:22.969
No! Why, Sky?

47:23.040 --> 47:24.871
Sky, you just can't
be looking at people.

47:24.942 --> 47:27.536
I mean, the last girl that
looked at me needed stitches.

47:27.611 --> 47:30.705
<i>Yo, what's up with your girl,
Lina? Staring like she loco.</i>

47:30.781 --> 47:31.907
You know the deal.

47:31.982 --> 47:33.449
Yeah, I do, but she don't.

47:33.517 --> 47:34.643
She's from Malibu.

47:34.718 --> 47:38.882
Like, people over there just be looking
at each other for no reason. All the time.

47:38.956 --> 47:42.255
Let me talk to her and explain
it. She'll be straight. Okay?

47:42.926 --> 47:45.622
Fine. We didn't come
here to fight, no way.

47:48.365 --> 47:51.129
Will somebody tell
me what just happened.

47:51.201 --> 47:53.999
Sky, you can't just be looking
at people any kind of way.

47:54.071 --> 47:58.440
Like, you can glance at somebody
and smile. But if you stare at them

47:58.508 --> 48:00.669
or you give them one of these.

48:00.978 --> 48:02.377
Or one of these.

48:03.814 --> 48:05.179
That's disrespectful.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.375
And your ass.

48:07.317 --> 48:08.944
<i>You understand, chica?</i>

48:09.019 --> 48:11.715
Yeah. I think so.

48:11.822 --> 48:15.656
Good, next time we bring you to
East LA, bring your sunglasses.

48:15.726 --> 48:17.193
Yeah. Big ones.

48:17.961 --> 48:19.428
All right, come, honey.

48:22.566 --> 48:23.931
It's all good.
Everything okay?

48:24.001 --> 48:25.195
Yeah, come on.

49:01.438 --> 49:04.464
Five, six, seven, eight. Two.

49:08.478 --> 49:11.413
Five, six, seven, eight. Two.

49:13.050 --> 49:14.039
What's wrong with me?

49:16.787 --> 49:18.220
Two, four.

49:19.623 --> 49:20.612
God...

49:24.695 --> 49:25.855
I suck. Great.

49:27.631 --> 49:29.599
Okay. One...

49:31.501 --> 49:32.866
Hold your chest up.

49:34.071 --> 49:35.299
What's the use?

49:36.006 --> 49:37.769
I'm nothing like my mother.

49:37.841 --> 49:40.537
Sky, look, I'm sure
that's not true.

49:41.778 --> 49:44.747
Because as much as I hate to
admit it, I'm a lot like my mom.

49:45.315 --> 49:46.907
I'm opinionated, stubborn...

49:46.984 --> 49:48.144
Loud.

49:51.455 --> 49:53.650
Yeah, that, too.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.919
Which means you have to have
a part of your mom in you.

49:58.428 --> 49:59.759
You really think so?

50:00.664 --> 50:02.188
Yeah, I really do.

50:03.333 --> 50:06.894
Well, would you
help me find her?

50:09.006 --> 50:09.995
Yeah.

50:11.008 --> 50:17.345
Ready? Five, six, seven,
eight. One, two, three, four.

50:17.514 --> 50:22.713
Keep your chest up. Seven, eight.
One, two, three and sit in it.

50:22.786 --> 50:25.118
Five, six, seven, clap.

50:26.957 --> 50:29.653
That's what I'm
talking about. It's fun.

50:58.155 --> 51:04.060
Here we go! Malibu Vista on the
move. Taking all you fools to school.

51:04.127 --> 51:08.188
<i>We're caliente. You
know, hot, hot, hot.</i>

51:08.265 --> 51:12.964
We always stay on top. We make
you sweat 'cause we run faster.

51:13.036 --> 51:16.130
<i>Try to catch up
and we say hasta.</i>

51:21.912 --> 51:25.905
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!

51:25.982 --> 51:28.246
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!

51:30.454 --> 51:32.820
Oh, my God. That was fun.

51:39.129 --> 51:41.324
Someone just
had a cheer-gasm.

51:41.398 --> 51:44.094
What? No! You guys are crazy.

51:44.167 --> 51:46.135
Don't front, Lina.

51:46.937 --> 51:49.963
She don't need to. She's already
got Evan's nose wide open.

51:50.040 --> 51:51.871
Whatever. You know.
For real, though.

51:51.942 --> 51:55.105
That boy's nose is so open you could
drive a truck up those nostrils.

51:56.613 --> 51:58.706
What's this?
It's a shoe-vite.

51:59.182 --> 52:03.346
I'm having a RDD party and
I want you guys to come.

52:04.121 --> 52:09.491
Look, Avery isn't in charge of the
social order at Malibu Vista. I am.

52:09.559 --> 52:12.585
And despite the little debacle
at the game the other day,

52:12.662 --> 52:17.395
everyone can see that Lina is
making the Sea Lions fabulente!

52:17.467 --> 52:19.662
Everybody is talking
about it. So...

52:22.205 --> 52:26.801
See you there? And,
please, dress to excess!

52:26.992 --> 52:29.859
Okay, so I'm gonna need two
of these, then. Thank you.

52:29.929 --> 52:31.624
I need a right and
a left. Perfect.

52:31.697 --> 52:32.664
Thanks.

52:34.867 --> 52:37.028
New shoes. Oh, my gosh.

52:37.103 --> 52:41.836
Sweet! Okay, we've just been
jumped into the Rodeo Drive Divas.

52:41.907 --> 52:44.467
Uh-uh. Hold up. Mama said
I can't be in no gang.

52:45.611 --> 52:49.206
No, it's not a gang. I mean,
well, not really anyway.

52:49.281 --> 52:51.511
But they are the most
exclusive clique at MV.

52:51.584 --> 52:53.984
I mean, their
parties are legendary.

52:54.053 --> 52:56.419
Look, you've got it
twisted. We're cheerleaders.

52:56.489 --> 52:58.889
They'll be lucky if
we come to their party.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.448
Thank you. She's right.

53:00.526 --> 53:04.587
I mean, cheerleaders are supposed to
be at the top of the social food chain.

53:05.397 --> 53:06.523
I wish we could go.

53:06.599 --> 53:08.829
I mean, I would give
my best toe-touch

53:08.901 --> 53:10.596
if I could party
with the RDDs.

53:10.669 --> 53:14.127
Well, I didn't say we're not
going. I mean, we're cheerleaders,

53:14.206 --> 53:17.369
and we are the party.
Is that right, Sea Lions?

53:20.713 --> 53:22.647
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!

53:22.715 --> 53:23.943
Sea Lions! Sea Lions!

53:26.152 --> 53:27.949
<i>You look so
pretty, mami.</i>

53:28.020 --> 53:29.612
I do?

53:29.688 --> 53:31.121
Yeah, you do.

53:31.190 --> 53:32.248
Baby.

53:38.998 --> 53:44.766
<i>Hey, I cannot believe that you let
Evan drive. That was so sweet, papi.</i>

53:45.871 --> 53:48.999
Only 'cause he loves
cars as much as me.

53:49.074 --> 53:50.666
But you love me more.

53:51.443 --> 53:53.308
<i>Of course, mija.</i>

53:55.748 --> 53:57.875
Victor, let's go
walk on the beach.

53:58.784 --> 53:59.808
Why?

53:59.885 --> 54:00.817
'Cause it's romantic.

54:01.887 --> 54:06.085
Getting sand in your
shoes, that ain't romantic.

54:06.725 --> 54:08.249
That's why you'll
never get none.

54:09.061 --> 54:10.358
Let's go, then.

54:15.067 --> 54:16.466
Okay.

54:16.535 --> 54:20.335
So, I got invited to
that Divas party, too.

54:21.307 --> 54:22.501
You want to go together?

54:22.575 --> 54:25.601
Evan, if we go together,
people are gonna talk.

54:26.645 --> 54:29.944
I already know what people are
saying. I don't care, really.

54:30.015 --> 54:32.142
Wait, wait. What
have you heard?

54:32.218 --> 54:34.083
No, let me guess.

54:34.153 --> 54:37.589
<i>Your sister who told you I'm some
puta chasing after a rich white boy.</i>

54:37.656 --> 54:40.147
Don't get caught up in
Avery's drama, please.

54:40.259 --> 54:42.056
No. You don't get it.

54:42.127 --> 54:43.185
No, you don't get my sister.

54:43.996 --> 54:46.226
She has to
dominate everything.

54:46.298 --> 54:48.391
For instance, when she
didn't get Sea Lion captain,

54:48.467 --> 54:50.128
she cried for three days.

54:50.603 --> 54:51.934
For real? Yeah.

54:52.037 --> 54:56.201
So, I guess when Avery's mean to you,
it means she sees you as a threat.

54:57.109 --> 54:58.872
Well, thanks for
telling me that.

54:58.944 --> 55:00.275
Then go to the party with me.

55:02.548 --> 55:04.379
Only if you
practice your salsa.

55:04.450 --> 55:05.542
What?

55:06.151 --> 55:07.812
I thought I had a
pretty decent salsa.

55:07.886 --> 55:09.376
No.

55:09.455 --> 55:11.355
So, I'm not the best dancer.

55:11.991 --> 55:15.119
But I hope you think
I'm better at this.

55:20.299 --> 55:21.994
Okay, so... Okay.

55:23.002 --> 55:24.799
That totally spoiled
the mood, huh?

55:24.870 --> 55:25.894
Yeah.

55:26.872 --> 55:28.772
Last one to the ocean.

55:30.042 --> 55:31.009
I'll beat you.

55:31.076 --> 55:32.100
No, you won't.

56:00.039 --> 56:01.438
What is she doing?

56:04.176 --> 56:05.768
Nice salsa hips, sea monkey.

56:05.844 --> 56:08.142
<i>Yeah, you should go on
Dancing With the Tards.</i>

56:08.881 --> 56:10.405
Don't run away.

56:12.885 --> 56:16.480
Mess with my squad and you mess
with me, Avery. Leave Sky alone.

56:16.555 --> 56:19.149
Gladly, if you'll
leave my brother alone.

56:20.326 --> 56:22.351
Your brother and
I like each other.

56:22.428 --> 56:24.328
Sky wants nothing
to do with you.

56:25.297 --> 56:26.628
The feeling is mutual.

56:27.199 --> 56:30.794
Avery, the United
Nations is boring me.

56:30.869 --> 56:33.736
Anyway, we have
All Star practice.

56:34.973 --> 56:37.237
Unlike you. Bye.

56:39.611 --> 56:40.976
Kick rocks.

56:41.580 --> 56:46.017
You know, they're not gonna stop until
somebody puts a foot up their spanks.

56:46.085 --> 56:48.178
Bump it. I'll do the time.

56:48.253 --> 56:49.379
Wait, wait, wait.

56:50.389 --> 56:51.583
I got an idea.

56:51.657 --> 56:54.490
Put cream depilatories
in their hair conditioner?

56:54.560 --> 56:56.755
No, let's take
them on for real.

56:56.829 --> 56:58.592
At the All Star Championship.

56:59.832 --> 57:03.290
I like that. That works. Come
on, girl, smile. Don't be nervous.

57:03.369 --> 57:06.099
You know what we could
do? We could do a...

57:06.171 --> 57:07.297
Yeah, but...

57:07.973 --> 57:12.103
Look, the only way we're going to shut
Avery up is if we beat her on her own turf.

57:12.177 --> 57:14.304
And the only way to do
that is to become All Stars.

57:14.380 --> 57:17.247
You mean, we won't
be Sea Lions anymore?

57:17.316 --> 57:18.613
No, we'll still
cheer for the school,

57:18.684 --> 57:20.982
but we're gonna have to
double up our practices

57:21.053 --> 57:22.918
to be ready for the
Spirit Championship.

57:24.456 --> 57:28.119
Hey! Hey, wouldn't it be worth
it if it'll crush the Jags?

57:28.560 --> 57:32.792
She's right. I mean, I secretly plot
their demise like a comic book villain,

57:32.865 --> 57:34.765
and that's not healthy.

57:35.667 --> 57:37.225
Lina's way is better.

57:37.536 --> 57:39.834
But don't we need
a gym to sponsor us?

57:39.905 --> 57:41.133
Let me worry about that.

57:41.440 --> 57:43.670
All I want to know is
if you guys are down,

57:43.742 --> 57:46.438
because we need to take
this to the next level.

57:46.512 --> 57:49.345
Yeah! And then cut the
brakes on those Jags,

57:49.415 --> 57:51.576
and watch them
crash and burn...

57:51.884 --> 57:55.877
Okay, minus the crazy part,
that's exactly the spirit we need.

57:56.321 --> 57:59.381
So do you guys feel
it? Who wants to win?

57:59.992 --> 58:02.722
Yeah! Sea Lions!

58:03.228 --> 58:05.890
What about it, Sky?
What do you think?

58:05.964 --> 58:07.261
I think

58:09.468 --> 58:10.662
it's time to bring it.

58:14.506 --> 58:17.998
<i>Like, pick up. Like,
pick up. Like...</i>

58:18.477 --> 58:21.037
Avery speaking.
Aren't you lucky?

58:21.113 --> 58:24.048
Guess what Tila Tequila and
her Sea Lions are up to now.

58:24.116 --> 58:26.607
Kayla, Tila
Tequila isn't Latin.

58:27.252 --> 58:29.482
But tequila's Mexican, right?

58:29.555 --> 58:32.149
Yeah, but she's like, Asiany.

58:32.991 --> 58:34.253
Whatever.

58:34.326 --> 58:38.626
Anyway, word on the blog is
they're becoming an All Star team.

58:38.697 --> 58:39.994
Get out.

58:40.232 --> 58:42.166
And there's more.

58:42.234 --> 58:45.829
They're going to compete
in the Spirit Championship.

58:50.008 --> 58:51.202
Hello?

58:52.878 --> 58:54.209
<i>Yeah. Wait,</i>

58:54.346 --> 58:57.406
you're not sweating
those wannabes, are you?

58:57.483 --> 59:00.975
Of course not. They're just a
joke. Look, I'll see you tomorrow.

59:01.053 --> 59:02.611
<i>One last thing.</i>

59:02.688 --> 59:07.489
My sources tell me that Evan
is taking little Lina Lambada

59:07.559 --> 59:09.550
to the RDD party.

59:28.580 --> 59:31.140
You asked Cat
to the RDD party?

59:31.216 --> 59:32.547
Let it go, Avery.

59:32.618 --> 59:34.813
Evan, she's a
freaking Sea Lion.

59:34.887 --> 59:38.823
So now the truth comes out. It
was never about her mother, was it?

59:39.124 --> 59:44.323
Look, Evan, you're a nice guy,
which is why you're blind and stupid.

59:44.796 --> 59:47.560
Now that the little Sea Lions
think that they're All Stars,

59:47.633 --> 59:49.498
Cat's just using
you to psych me out.

59:49.568 --> 59:51.832
But, I've seen them practice.

59:51.904 --> 59:55.237
You might want to go back on
your meds, because your Jags,

59:55.307 --> 59:57.707
they have some
serious competition.

59:57.776 --> 01:00:00.176
Not in my worst cheer-mare.

01:00:25.037 --> 01:00:29.701
Well, well, looks like you ladies better
get ready for the championship, huh?

01:00:29.775 --> 01:00:33.802
The thought of the Sea Lions in the
Spirit Championships makes me ill.

01:00:35.547 --> 01:00:38.345
Kayla, honey, that's
sushi, not an Oreo.

01:00:38.784 --> 01:00:40.376
Ahi helps me think.

01:00:40.452 --> 01:00:41.851
About what?

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.289
I have a friend who's been on
the MV waiting list for months.

01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:47.416
So?

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:54.525
So I wonder, how did those Sea Lion
ringers get approved so quickly?

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:58.468
Well, I thought it was
obvious. Pure talent.

01:00:58.537 --> 01:01:00.061
Evan, go away.

01:01:01.273 --> 01:01:03.070
Okay, bye.

01:01:08.347 --> 01:01:11.475
Someone snuck them in.

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.519
OMFG!

01:01:15.187 --> 01:01:17.951
Kayla, they're
illegal cheer-migrants.

01:01:22.761 --> 01:01:25.423
Evan is really
good. Yeah, he knows.

01:01:27.332 --> 01:01:29.698
So, I'll pick you
up tomorrow, okay?

01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:34.798
Okay. Is it cool if Sky rolls
with us? She doesn't have a date.

01:01:34.873 --> 01:01:36.864
Yeah. Of course it's cool.

01:01:37.809 --> 01:01:38.969
I feel like Cinderella.

01:01:39.044 --> 01:01:40.375
Yeah, me, too.

01:01:41.546 --> 01:01:45.312
I mean, the guy, the
guy... You know, Charming?

01:01:45.384 --> 01:01:47.716
Yeah, that guy, yeah.

01:01:47.786 --> 01:01:49.219
So, tomorrow.

01:01:49.287 --> 01:01:50.481
Okay, see you.

01:01:51.256 --> 01:01:52.314
Perfect.

01:01:54.826 --> 01:01:56.384
All right, guys, you ready?

01:01:58.330 --> 01:01:59.524
Let's do this.

01:02:02.801 --> 01:02:04.632
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:02:09.441 --> 01:02:12.308
Bring it up. And
roll it around.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:23.247
What?

01:02:23.321 --> 01:02:25.380
Sky, what's wrong? Why is you
dad talking to the principal?

01:02:25.457 --> 01:02:26.549
All right, but I
want to be the one...

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:27.683
I don't know.

01:02:30.896 --> 01:02:32.022
What's wrong?

01:02:34.299 --> 01:02:37.462
Gloria, Treyvonetta, you
need to come with me, please.

01:02:38.704 --> 01:02:40.103
Henry, what's wrong?

01:02:40.906 --> 01:02:43.306
Look, there's no easy
way to say this, Lina.

01:02:43.742 --> 01:02:47.178
The Board has revoked their transfer
approval effective immediately.

01:02:47.512 --> 01:02:51.209
That's not fair. If anyone
should be punished, it's us.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:54.346
Look, girls, if there was anything
I could do, you know I would've.

01:02:54.653 --> 01:02:56.416
Now, you know I would've.

01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:59.250
I'm sorry, but...

01:03:00.926 --> 01:03:02.553
Let's just go, girls.

01:03:07.532 --> 01:03:08.726
Peace. Out, you all.

01:03:10.469 --> 01:03:11.663
Take care.

01:03:14.172 --> 01:03:15.332
Lina!

01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:19.277
You jealous bitch.
You ratted us out.

01:03:19.344 --> 01:03:22.871
It's a good thing you can't touch
me, because you could be expelled

01:03:22.948 --> 01:03:24.643
just like your
little home girls.

01:03:24.716 --> 01:03:26.775
Don't blame Avery for
getting them deported.

01:03:26.852 --> 01:03:29.514
One more word from you, and I
will herkie you in the throat.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:32.056
You forgot you can't reach me.

01:03:33.225 --> 01:03:37.855
It's okay, Kayla. I'll gladly take the
credit for clubbing those baby seals.

01:03:37.929 --> 01:03:40.193
Hey, Cheer-ella De Vil,
there's a big difference

01:03:40.265 --> 01:03:42.893
between seals and
sea lions, you know.

01:03:42.968 --> 01:03:48.167
Hey, goofazon. I don't care. Post it for
your BFF on your fungus-filled Facebook page.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.367
You are seriously trying to
catch an All Star beat down.

01:03:50.442 --> 01:03:52.569
It's okay, Lina. Calm down.

01:03:53.478 --> 01:03:54.672
It's not worth it.

01:03:55.147 --> 01:03:56.705
Let's go say goodbye
to our friends.

01:03:56.848 --> 01:04:00.306
And say bye-bye to the Spirit
Championships while you're at it.

01:04:01.286 --> 01:04:02.844
Bye-bye.

01:04:02.921 --> 01:04:04.183
Bye, losers.

01:04:17.903 --> 01:04:20.929
Hey! What are you
doing out here?

01:04:21.506 --> 01:04:23.406
You have to get
ready for the party.

01:04:26.278 --> 01:04:29.770
I'm not going. It doesn't
feel right without my girls.

01:04:30.448 --> 01:04:33.281
They should be
here. It's not fair.

01:04:33.752 --> 01:04:36.186
No, it's not,

01:04:37.689 --> 01:04:40.249
but look at it this way.

01:04:40.325 --> 01:04:43.294
Do you think they would want
you sitting here feeling sad

01:04:44.462 --> 01:04:47.295
and miss out on your
first real date with Evan?

01:04:48.567 --> 01:04:49.693
I don't know.

01:04:51.136 --> 01:04:54.196
Come on, you know
what they would say.

01:04:54.272 --> 01:04:56.467
And I can hear
Gloria and Trey now,

01:04:56.541 --> 01:04:59.704
<i>"Mami, you better handle that
double dip of vanilla caliente!"</i>

01:04:59.778 --> 01:05:05.375
"Shoot, 'cause if you don't,
I'm a push up on you, girl.

01:05:06.384 --> 01:05:07.544
"Real talk. "

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:08.677
Okay.

01:05:10.956 --> 01:05:12.787
Okay, that was so scary.

01:05:14.426 --> 01:05:18.829
All right, I'll go, as long as
you promise to never do that again.

01:05:19.331 --> 01:05:21.492
Okay. And to never
wear that again. What...

01:05:22.234 --> 01:05:27.228
You need a fashion intervention. Let's
get to work on this. What is this?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.640
<i>Mami! Come on.</i>

01:05:35.547 --> 01:05:36.673
Up.

01:06:24.963 --> 01:06:28.956
Wow. It doesn't
even look like me.

01:06:31.503 --> 01:06:34.870
It looks like... Your
mom. I noticed that, too.

01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:42.679
Okay. Got it?

01:06:45.483 --> 01:06:46.848
It's so curly.

01:06:46.918 --> 01:06:48.283
You look cute. Don't worry.

01:06:49.487 --> 01:06:51.011
Wait. I almost forgot.

01:07:12.143 --> 01:07:15.340
Here. I want you to have this.

01:07:16.581 --> 01:07:18.208
My mom's team gave it to her.

01:07:19.851 --> 01:07:21.842
She was a really
good captain, too.

01:07:22.787 --> 01:07:23.845
Sky, I can't take this.

01:07:23.922 --> 01:07:26.482
No, no, no, no. She'd
want you to have it.

01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:30.721
She would've really liked you.

01:07:34.165 --> 01:07:37.066
It'll look really nice
with my outfit tonight.

01:07:39.037 --> 01:07:40.163
Oh, my God. What?

01:07:40.238 --> 01:07:41.500
I got to get ready.

01:07:41.573 --> 01:07:43.006
Okay, go, go, go.

01:07:46.378 --> 01:07:47.367
Whoa!

01:07:48.079 --> 01:07:49.137
Yeah.

01:07:51.449 --> 01:07:53.314
You look amazing. Thanks.

01:07:54.052 --> 01:07:56.612
To be honest, I think
that every time I see you.

01:07:57.789 --> 01:07:59.017
Too corny?

01:07:59.090 --> 01:08:00.819
Yeah. But I like it.

01:08:03.728 --> 01:08:08.665
Sorry, but if I don't start dancing soon,
then these heels are so not worth it.

01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:10.866
Okay, let's go.

01:08:10.935 --> 01:08:12.562
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

01:08:12.637 --> 01:08:14.502
We've gotta take a picture.

01:08:15.106 --> 01:08:16.300
Catalina.

01:08:16.374 --> 01:08:17.272
All right.

01:08:17.408 --> 01:08:20.344
Get in there, now,
okay. Close, now.

01:08:20.412 --> 01:08:22.243
Now, say, "I'm with stupid!"

01:08:22.313 --> 01:08:24.008
I'm with stupid!

01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:27.048
Perfect. Okay.

01:08:27.118 --> 01:08:28.745
Bye, honey.

01:08:28.819 --> 01:08:31.618
Have fun. You look great.

01:08:32.490 --> 01:08:34.014
Drive carefully.

01:08:34.091 --> 01:08:37.390
<i>Bye, Mommy. Adios. Bye.</i>

01:08:54.879 --> 01:08:56.437
Hi.

01:08:57.282 --> 01:09:01.218
Christina, you look hot.

01:09:01.286 --> 01:09:04.220
Just hot? Because I
was going for sizzling.

01:09:06.591 --> 01:09:08.388
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:09.893
Definitely sizzling.

01:09:09.961 --> 01:09:13.488
Thanks, but... That was
definitely not sanitary.

01:09:39.858 --> 01:09:41.553
Trey? How are you?

01:09:41.626 --> 01:09:43.787
Hey, baby.

01:09:43.862 --> 01:09:45.090
Sky, you did this?

01:09:45.162 --> 01:09:46.288
Yes, I wanted to surprise you.

01:09:46.363 --> 01:09:47.831
How are you? Good to see you.

01:09:47.899 --> 01:09:48.888
What's up, Evan?

01:09:49.901 --> 01:09:53.631
Wait. This is my
song. Shall we?

01:10:04.415 --> 01:10:05.814
Look at her.

01:10:05.884 --> 01:10:07.579
She acts like she
owns this world.

01:10:07.652 --> 01:10:09.745
She'll never be like us.

01:10:21.065 --> 01:10:22.965
Oh, oh!

01:10:32.443 --> 01:10:34.638
Like mother, like daughter.

01:10:34.712 --> 01:10:36.805
Shut up, Avery. You shut up.

01:10:38.983 --> 01:10:40.348
Ignore her.

01:10:42.854 --> 01:10:45.584
Hey, you okay?

01:10:45.657 --> 01:10:47.147
I can handle her.

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:22.350
Oh!

01:11:59.030 --> 01:12:03.057
I'm sorry. Is there a waiting
list for this spot, too?

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.169
Look around, Cat.
You don't belong here.

01:12:09.874 --> 01:12:13.503
First your mother. And now
your little ghetto friends.

01:12:13.578 --> 01:12:16.046
I'm sorry, but I don't think
you're going to be happy

01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:18.742
until there's drive-bys and
chickens in the front yard!

01:12:20.118 --> 01:12:23.781
Go back to the barrio,
where you belong!

01:12:24.322 --> 01:12:25.311
Go.

01:12:25.957 --> 01:12:27.686
Go, bye.

01:12:27.759 --> 01:12:29.317
Peace out!

01:12:32.664 --> 01:12:34.723
What, Evan?

01:12:38.936 --> 01:12:41.427
No, let Evan talk to her.

01:12:44.309 --> 01:12:45.901
I don't know what to do.

01:12:45.977 --> 01:12:48.104
It's okay.
Ear-muffs! Ear-muffs!

01:12:49.547 --> 01:12:52.414
Come on. Let me give her
just one good left hook.

01:12:53.017 --> 01:12:56.612
Lina, wait! Come on.

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:02.252
Leave me a glass
slipper or something.

01:13:02.327 --> 01:13:04.124
It's not funny, Evan.

01:13:04.195 --> 01:13:07.289
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

01:13:07.899 --> 01:13:12.666
Listen, what Avery did back
there was pure evil. I know.

01:13:13.471 --> 01:13:16.770
You know, she's the reason my
friends got kicked out of school.

01:13:16.841 --> 01:13:18.035
Oh, my God.

01:13:18.109 --> 01:13:19.906
What? You saw what
she did back there.

01:13:19.977 --> 01:13:24.073
I'm not defending her, okay?
But they did break a rule.

01:13:24.148 --> 01:13:27.140
And? Rules get
broken all the time.

01:13:27.218 --> 01:13:28.947
But, come on, that
doesn't make it right.

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.044
Of course you'd
be on Avery's side.

01:13:30.121 --> 01:13:31.281
Come on.

01:13:31.356 --> 01:13:33.324
What? Did you
narc them out, too?

01:13:35.126 --> 01:13:36.115
How can you say that?

01:13:36.194 --> 01:13:39.220
<i>You know, I guess I'm just
another chica gone loca, right?</i>

01:13:39.297 --> 01:13:42.027
You know how wild and
hot-blooded we are!

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:43.897
Now you do sound crazy.

01:13:44.602 --> 01:13:48.299
Then leave me alone,
Evan. We're done.

01:13:50.074 --> 01:13:51.473
Really?

01:13:52.076 --> 01:13:53.509
I mean it.

01:13:54.612 --> 01:13:56.011
Lina...

01:14:00.284 --> 01:14:01.945
Wait, wait, wait.

01:14:02.019 --> 01:14:04.579
G, yo, come pick me up.

01:14:04.655 --> 01:14:06.088
What? Take me back to East LA.

01:14:06.157 --> 01:14:07.215
I'm staying with you.

01:14:07.291 --> 01:14:09.816
No, Lina. You can't leave.

01:14:11.195 --> 01:14:14.062
<i>Why? What... The
Spirit Championship?</i>

01:14:14.132 --> 01:14:16.600
The Sea Lions will be
fine without me, okay?

01:14:16.667 --> 01:14:19.465
<i>All you have to do is find
another chica from East LA.</i>

01:14:19.537 --> 01:14:21.971
You know it's not like that.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.940
Look, we're sisters.

01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:28.508
<i>I'm your hermana, too.</i>

01:14:28.579 --> 01:14:31.480
Avery's right. I
don't belong here.

01:14:34.051 --> 01:14:37.646
I'm sorry, Sky, I can't
be your captain anymore.

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:40.817
It's yours.

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:50.264
Lina, yo, we want you back, but
you cannot desert the Sea Lions.

01:14:50.334 --> 01:14:52.734
We all worked too
hard to make them good.

01:14:52.804 --> 01:14:54.362
They'll be fine.

01:14:54.439 --> 01:14:56.134
You know that ain't true.

01:14:56.207 --> 01:14:59.267
Lina, if you bail on them,
they are going to fall apart.

01:14:59.343 --> 01:15:02.938
Just like the East LA
squad. Lina, that sucked.

01:15:04.449 --> 01:15:06.974
I can't go back.
I'll look stupid.

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:11.653
Yeah, but you gotta.
You're the captain.

01:15:15.526 --> 01:15:17.255
I hate you guys!

01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:20.957
And we miss you, too, boo.

01:15:23.067 --> 01:15:26.036
Now, go ahead. Do us right.

01:15:27.171 --> 01:15:28.866
Come on.

01:15:37.882 --> 01:15:40.214
I'm not replacing the girls.

01:15:40.284 --> 01:15:45.916
We don't have enough time. We'll
just rework the routines. Okay?

01:16:21.659 --> 01:16:23.456
I have bad news.

01:16:23.528 --> 01:16:28.261
We are turning in our pom
poms. Sorry. We're done.

01:16:28.332 --> 01:16:30.357
Later. Peace.

01:16:31.869 --> 01:16:33.302
Guys...

01:16:36.874 --> 01:16:38.307
They hate me.

01:16:38.376 --> 01:16:40.537
What? Why?

01:16:41.646 --> 01:16:43.614
They said it's hard enough
to keep their grades up,

01:16:43.681 --> 01:16:45.205
my routines are too hard,

01:16:45.283 --> 01:16:48.616
and that the extra practice is sending
their GPAs into a downward spiral.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:51.786
So, we only have half
an All Star squad now.

01:16:52.356 --> 01:16:54.620
So, what are we going to do?

01:16:55.259 --> 01:16:56.851
I don't know.

01:16:56.928 --> 01:17:01.365
I'm still trying to find a gym around
here, but they all sponsor other squads.

01:17:02.233 --> 01:17:03.825
Are you gonna give up?

01:17:03.901 --> 01:17:06.335
And let Avery win? Never.

01:17:07.004 --> 01:17:08.437
Hey, Cat,

01:17:08.506 --> 01:17:10.531
you're dreaming if you
still think you have a shot

01:17:10.608 --> 01:17:12.508
at winning the
Spirit Championships.

01:17:12.577 --> 01:17:15.876
Yeah, it's a
competition. Not a siesta.

01:17:15.947 --> 01:17:19.041
Back off, skanks, before I slap
that cheer out of your mouth.

01:17:19.116 --> 01:17:21.846
I mean, you think you can just roll up
on us without even thinking about it?

01:17:21.919 --> 01:17:24.046
Yo, yo, we don't
play that game.

01:17:24.121 --> 01:17:27.318
And I am so sick of you
fronting like you were stunting.

01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:29.983
You know what? As
a matter of fact...

01:17:30.061 --> 01:17:31.494
No, no, no, no, Sky...
This is not gonna be good.

01:17:31.562 --> 01:17:33.928
This is not gonna be
good. But it's gonna be on.

01:17:33.998 --> 01:17:35.022
Check it, I got this.

01:17:35.099 --> 01:17:36.088
So, watch what
you're looking at.

01:17:36.167 --> 01:17:37.634
Sky. I got this.

01:17:37.702 --> 01:17:38.691
Watch what you're looking at.

01:17:38.769 --> 01:17:40.896
For real. Just chill. Chill.

01:17:40.972 --> 01:17:43.099
Someone's getting
a little ghetto.

01:17:43.174 --> 01:17:45.039
Go practice that Zen thing.

01:17:46.143 --> 01:17:48.976
Who took the spirit
stick out of your butt?

01:17:49.046 --> 01:17:51.139
Look, Avery, Evan was right.

01:17:51.215 --> 01:17:53.911
The only reason you sweat me is
because you know that I can beat you.

01:17:53.985 --> 01:17:57.216
No, that just means Evan
was wrong about two things.

01:17:57.288 --> 01:18:00.382
Choosing you and doubting me.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:02.683
I don't think so.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.390
No, that's right. You wouldn't. Because,
see, you don't think like an All Star.

01:18:10.668 --> 01:18:11.657
Come on.

01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:16.463
Don't touch me.

01:18:18.809 --> 01:18:21.835
What did that cheer-ial
killer mean by that?

01:18:21.912 --> 01:18:24.506
Don't know. Don't have
time to think about it.

01:18:24.582 --> 01:18:28.609
Look, I am canceling practice. We're
going to meet after school, though.

01:18:28.686 --> 01:18:30.313
Why?

01:18:30.388 --> 01:18:31.912
We're going on a field trip.

01:18:55.613 --> 01:18:57.672
I knew we should've
took the bus.

01:18:57.748 --> 01:18:59.306
Where are we?

01:18:59.417 --> 01:19:02.580
Some of my squad still
volunteer here every week.

01:19:02.653 --> 01:19:06.111
And I called Gloria and she said
a bunch of them will be here today.

01:20:12.056 --> 01:20:17.187
LA! East LA! East LA!

01:20:17.428 --> 01:20:19.862
Lina!

01:20:20.965 --> 01:20:22.990
What's up, girl?

01:20:23.768 --> 01:20:25.895
I miss you, too.

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:28.530
Lina, why are we here?

01:20:28.606 --> 01:20:31.598
Because I've got the
best idea I've ever had.

01:20:31.675 --> 01:20:34.542
Gloria got this gym to
sponsor us as All Stars!

01:20:34.612 --> 01:20:36.204
I know!

01:20:37.314 --> 01:20:40.715
All we got to do is combine
Sea Lions with East LA,

01:20:40.785 --> 01:20:42.776
and we could
become a dream team!

01:20:42.853 --> 01:20:46.414
Look, Avery was right. All Star squads
are nothing like high school squads.

01:20:46.524 --> 01:20:47.855
It doesn't matter
where you live.

01:20:47.925 --> 01:20:51.417
We can cheer together and
become a whole new All Star team.

01:20:51.829 --> 01:20:54.297
I've been trying to tell you.

01:20:54.365 --> 01:20:57.232
Okay, I know I
wasn't thinking.

01:20:57.301 --> 01:20:59.861
Sea Lions, come on,
get into formation!

01:21:10.981 --> 01:21:13.575
See? My routine has a serious
Latin and hip hop feel,

01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:16.051
and no matter how hard I
try, they still don't get it.

01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.022
"My routine?" Lina, you're
the one who needs to get it.

01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:21.079
What?

01:21:21.158 --> 01:21:23.388
You are trying
to make them us.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:25.690
No, I'm trying
to make them good.

01:21:25.763 --> 01:21:28.596
Look, Lina, you know that every
cheerleader has their strengths.

01:21:28.666 --> 01:21:32.124
Use them. Stop trying to make the
Sea Lions something they're not.

01:21:50.721 --> 01:21:53.485
Use Christina's
gymnastic skills.

01:21:54.058 --> 01:21:56.549
And nobody has better
facials than Sky.

01:21:56.627 --> 01:21:58.618
And she's stupid flexible.

01:21:58.696 --> 01:22:03.224
Maybe we can up the
difficulty on all the stunts.

01:22:06.237 --> 01:22:08.831
Yo, it'd be tight if we added
another pyramid sequence.

01:22:08.906 --> 01:22:11.238
And a load
into a 2-1-1?

01:22:11.308 --> 01:22:15.074
And look, since the party, they
got some rhythm in their hips.

01:22:16.447 --> 01:22:18.813
Maybe I can get Victor to teach
them some of their boxing moves.

01:22:18.883 --> 01:22:20.748
Girl, yo, that would be dope.

01:22:23.187 --> 01:22:26.782
We're about to have an All Star
routine that's off the chain.

01:22:26.857 --> 01:22:28.222
No one's going to think
to break it down like this.

01:22:28.292 --> 01:22:30.954
Nobody. Okay. All right.

01:22:31.495 --> 01:22:32.894
Okay, Sea Lions,

01:22:32.963 --> 01:22:36.524
are you guys ready to be All
Stars? You guys down with it?

01:22:38.235 --> 01:22:41.762
Okay, Y to the yes! You know,
we can come here to practice.

01:22:42.206 --> 01:22:46.142
Dream Team, let's get to work!

01:24:05.856 --> 01:24:07.448
Excuse me.

01:24:15.933 --> 01:24:18.026
I like you, Lina.

01:24:18.602 --> 01:24:21.901
I like that you're
stubborn and competitive.

01:24:21.972 --> 01:24:23.769
Because you're talented.

01:24:24.041 --> 01:24:27.340
And that you're an
insanely beautiful klutz.

01:24:27.478 --> 01:24:30.208
You know, and I like
how you brush me off

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.340
but at the same time you make
me feel like you're into it

01:24:33.417 --> 01:24:35.009
and that maybe
I have a chance.

01:24:36.186 --> 01:24:40.714
You know, and the fact that you think
you're so different and out of place here.

01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:43.992
But in all reality,
you're just being yourself.

01:24:45.896 --> 01:24:48.057
And the way you look at me,

01:24:48.132 --> 01:24:50.794
I mean, I feel like
you actually see me.

01:24:51.435 --> 01:24:53.062
And most of all,

01:24:54.405 --> 01:24:56.771
I like that I can
be myself around you.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:58.307
Ooh!

01:24:58.375 --> 01:24:59.467
Everybody got that?

01:24:59.543 --> 01:25:00.567
Yeah, I got that.

01:25:00.644 --> 01:25:01.633
We heard every word.

01:25:01.712 --> 01:25:04.738
We're putting it on YouTube!

01:25:04.948 --> 01:25:06.108
Good.

01:25:07.651 --> 01:25:09.243
Now it's on you.

01:25:15.526 --> 01:25:17.585
Evan, what was that?

01:25:18.896 --> 01:25:20.830
I thought we
talked about this.

01:25:20.898 --> 01:25:23.389
Yeah, I love you, too, sis.

01:25:23.467 --> 01:25:25.594
Are you trying
to ruin my life?

01:26:01.738 --> 01:26:04.468
Don't worry, it's
only cheerleading!

01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:09.511
Look who's barrio
fabulous again.

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.639
What are they doing here?

01:26:17.321 --> 01:26:20.484
You were right, Avery. I wasn't
thinking like an All Star.

01:26:20.557 --> 01:26:21.615
But you know what?

01:26:21.692 --> 01:26:22.716
What?

01:26:22.793 --> 01:26:25.023
Now I'm thinking
like a winner.

01:26:26.797 --> 01:26:29.630
Honestly, I'm
glad they're here,

01:26:29.700 --> 01:26:32.760
because when you're an All Star you
want to compete against the best.

01:26:32.836 --> 01:26:35.464
And you guys are...

01:26:39.476 --> 01:26:43.412
I'm so sorry. I really thought that
I could say that with a straight face.

01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:46.938
But the truth is
you're still losers.

01:26:49.219 --> 01:26:53.315
I don't speak Taco Bell
menu. So, what does that mean?

01:26:53.724 --> 01:26:55.089
Bring it!

01:26:59.596 --> 01:27:02.997
<i>Hey, guys. I'm Giuliana Rancic
here for E! Entertainment News,</i>

01:27:03.066 --> 01:27:05.330
at the All Star
Spirit Championship.

01:27:05.402 --> 01:27:08.132
Cheerleaders from all
over have come right here

01:27:08.205 --> 01:27:11.572
to see which squad is the
best of the best. So get ready

01:27:11.642 --> 01:27:14.975
for one of the fiercest cheerleading
competitions you have ever seen.

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:11.328
Whoa!

01:28:58.115 --> 01:29:01.414
All right, take a
bow. What? Dream Team!

01:29:09.693 --> 01:29:13.754
<i>The teams moving on to
the finals tomorrow are</i>

01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:16.321
<i>Glendale,</i>

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:18.766
<i>the Jaguars,</i>

01:29:18.835 --> 01:29:22.293
<i>the California
All Stars,</i>

01:29:22.372 --> 01:29:24.772
<i>and the Malibu
Dream Team!</i>

01:29:27.511 --> 01:29:30.742
The heat is on. And we're
gonna be back tomorrow,

01:29:30.814 --> 01:29:34.910
to see who takes home the coveted
All Star Spirit Championship trophy.

01:29:37.654 --> 01:29:39.053
Thanks, Henry.

01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:42.622
For everything.

01:29:43.293 --> 01:29:45.921
Great. Now he's gonna
love you forever.

01:29:50.867 --> 01:29:52.596
<i>Giuliana Rancic
here for E! News.</i>

01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:56.400
And we are just moments away from
the final rounds in the second day

01:29:56.473 --> 01:29:58.703
of the All Star
Spirit Championship.

01:29:58.775 --> 01:30:02.370
The teams to watch for are
newcomers the Malibu Dream Team

01:30:02.446 --> 01:30:05.711
and the returning
champion, All Star Jaguars.

01:30:05.782 --> 01:30:09.149
Both teams bring very different
styles to this competition.

01:30:09.219 --> 01:30:10.379
And from what I've seen,

01:30:10.454 --> 01:30:13.514
it is gonna come down to
heart versus experience.

01:32:39.002 --> 01:32:42.904
That was a fantastic performance
by the All Star Jaguars,

01:32:42.973 --> 01:32:46.636
but this David and Goliath
story is far from over.

01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:49.804
Up next, the
Malibu Dream Team.

01:32:53.216 --> 01:32:57.175
You see all those people out
there? They believe in us.

01:32:57.921 --> 01:33:01.186
This is the Spirit Championship, and
I ain't leaving without a bracelet.

01:33:01.258 --> 01:33:03.556
Y'all down? Yeah!

01:33:14.671 --> 01:33:17.105
You okay?

01:33:18.141 --> 01:33:19.904
I just wish she were here.

01:33:19.976 --> 01:33:22.410
Your mother's always
here. In your heart.

01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:02.562
Dream Team! Dream Team!

01:36:09.079 --> 01:36:12.776
Wow, those were two
outstanding performances.

01:36:12.849 --> 01:36:15.841
Now let's see what the
judges have decided.

01:36:40.744 --> 01:36:44.475
It's official. The
best of the best are

01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:49.280
the Malibu Dream Team!

01:36:53.523 --> 01:36:55.320
Dream Team! Dream Team!

01:36:55.391 --> 01:36:57.359
Dream Team! Dream Team!

01:36:59.696 --> 01:37:02.358
The crowd is going crazy.
It is an official upset.

01:37:02.432 --> 01:37:06.368
The best of the best, the winners
of the All Star Spirit Championship

01:37:06.436 --> 01:37:09.371
and the team that has
captured the nation's heart,

01:37:09.439 --> 01:37:11.634
is the Malibu Dream Team.

01:37:26.923 --> 01:37:29.892
So, is this the part
where we kiss and make up?

01:37:29.959 --> 01:37:32.427
Cat, bite me.

01:37:36.533 --> 01:37:40.469
I know. I know. Losing
sucks. It's mine.

01:37:44.607 --> 01:37:47.508
Come on, Lina, let's
go take a picture.

01:37:56.886 --> 01:37:58.649
Now I have all my sisters.

01:38:08.598 --> 01:38:09.929
<i>With me</i>

01:38:15.672 --> 01:38:16.900
<i>The way</i>

01:38:22.745 --> 01:38:23.973
<i>With me</i>

01:38:24.914 --> 01:38:27.212
<i>I try to get to you</i>

01:38:30.253 --> 01:38:31.550
<i>How far</i>

01:38:32.422 --> 01:38:34.117
<i>I gotta get to you</i>

01:38:39.362 --> 01:38:41.057
<i>I gotta get to you</i>

01:38:41.531 --> 01:38:43.294
<i>Smiling beautiful</i>

01:38:43.499 --> 01:38:44.796
<i>First sight</i>

01:38:44.868 --> 01:38:46.836
<i>I"m gonna tell
him the truth</i>

01:38:48.671 --> 01:38:51.231
<i>It took a little
while to realize</i>

01:38:51.708 --> 01:38:53.699
<i>I was falling for you</i>

01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:56.979
<i>"Cause all I
see is your face</i>

01:38:57.046 --> 01:38:59.276
<i>You really blow me away</i>

01:39:00.216 --> 01:39:02.013
<i>With all that you do</i>

01:39:02.218 --> 01:39:06.484
<i>And if I see you again
I"ll take you into my hands</i>

01:39:06.956 --> 01:39:08.924
<i>I"m calling out say</i>

01:39:09.158 --> 01:39:13.026
