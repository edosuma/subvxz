WEBVTT

00:03.001 --> 00:04.301
So what time
is your flight?

00:04.302 --> 00:05.402
8:00 a.m.

00:05.403 --> 00:06.837
8:00 a.m.?

00:06.838 --> 00:07.938
Wow.

00:07.939 --> 00:09.440
Yep.

00:09.441 --> 00:12.876
You want me to drive you?
That'd be nice.

00:12.877 --> 00:15.994
So what time you think
we should leave, around 6:00?

00:15.995 --> 00:18.954
To be on the safe side.
Sure, sure.

00:18.955 --> 00:21.583
You never know with traffic
and airport security and all.

00:21.584 --> 00:23.749
Would you rather
I call a cab?

00:23.750 --> 00:25.947
No, no. No, I won't hear of it.

00:25.948 --> 00:28.082
I'll call one for you.

00:29.591 --> 00:30.923
Golly, I'm gonna miss you.

00:30.924 --> 00:33.861
A couple days without
sex won't kill you.

00:33.862 --> 00:35.600
It's not just sex.

00:35.601 --> 00:37.765
You're my friend,
my companion.

00:38.967 --> 00:41.730
And what makes you think
I'm not going to have sex?

00:41.731 --> 00:43.491
Excuse me?

00:43.492 --> 00:46.426
Hey, when the cat's away,
the mice masturbate.

00:48.029 --> 00:50.027
Tell you what,

00:50.028 --> 00:52.131
why don't you open
a bottle of wine,

00:52.132 --> 00:55.364
come upstairs and I'll
give the mice something
to remember me by.

00:55.365 --> 00:57.565
Oh, yay, fresh memories.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.368
Much better than the video
of you on my iPhone.

01:02.636 --> 01:05.004
You took video of me
on your iPhone?

01:05.004 --> 01:06.637
Well, I...

01:06.638 --> 01:08.272
Just a little.

01:08.273 --> 01:10.641
I'd have asked permission,
but you were kind of busy.

01:10.642 --> 01:13.444
Give me the phone.

01:13.645 --> 01:15.278
Aw...

01:15.279 --> 01:17.245
Give it.

01:17.246 --> 01:20.249
Thank you.

01:20.250 --> 01:23.318
Oh, Charlie!

01:23.319 --> 01:25.654
What? You can't even tell
it's you.

01:25.655 --> 01:28.424
I can't turn my back
on you, can I?

01:28.425 --> 01:31.461
Actually, I have photographic
evidence that you can.

01:31.462 --> 01:33.429
Not anymore.

01:33.430 --> 01:35.665
Aw...

01:35.666 --> 01:36.767
Don't pout.

01:36.768 --> 01:39.103
Just get the wine
and come upstairs.

01:39.104 --> 01:40.104
Okay.

01:40.105 --> 01:41.639
And leave
the phone down here.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.408
Aw...

01:46.312 --> 01:50.882
Let's see, what's the proper
wine for the occasion?

01:50.883 --> 01:53.918
Ah, who cares? Everything goes
with ass biting.

01:55.554 --> 01:57.021
Hey.

01:57.022 --> 01:58.555
Thought you were on a date.

01:58.556 --> 01:59.923
I was.

01:59.924 --> 02:01.691
It didn't go well.

02:01.692 --> 02:05.296
Really? You're usually
such a hit with the ladies.

02:05.297 --> 02:08.699
This might have been
the worst date of my life.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.366
Did she dress you in
a leather bustier

02:10.368 --> 02:11.668
and tie you to a bed?

02:11.669 --> 02:13.204
No.

02:13.205 --> 02:16.208
Did she Super Glue a model car
to your balls?

02:16.209 --> 02:18.276
No.

02:18.277 --> 02:20.178
Did she talk you into putting on
one of Mom's dresses

02:20.179 --> 02:21.212
while she stole your wallet?

02:21.213 --> 02:22.880
No.

02:22.881 --> 02:25.850
Well, then this wasn't even
your worst date this month.

02:25.851 --> 02:27.785
I suppose.

02:27.786 --> 02:29.887
And thanks for the
highlight reel, by the way.

02:29.888 --> 02:31.089
Happy to help.

02:31.090 --> 02:33.724
I feel like going down
to the beach

02:33.725 --> 02:36.961
and diving into the ocean
and swimming out

02:36.962 --> 02:40.464
until my arms are so tired that
I sink below the waves

02:40.465 --> 02:41.732
into blessed oblivion.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.500
Hold on. Before you
do anything crazy,

02:43.501 --> 02:45.368
can you help me get
this bottle open?

02:45.369 --> 02:47.904
Sure. I mean...

02:47.905 --> 02:49.238
these women you meet online--

02:49.239 --> 02:51.440
you think you have
some kind of a connection,

02:51.441 --> 02:52.508
you know, a bond,

02:52.509 --> 02:54.109
and then you meet them
face-to-face

02:54.110 --> 02:55.310
and there's nothing.

02:55.311 --> 02:57.678
Just two lonely strangers
staring at each other

02:57.679 --> 03:00.147
across buffalo wings
and soft-serve ice cream.

03:00.148 --> 03:04.418
Well, maybe your problem
is taking them to a mall
food court on a first date.

03:04.419 --> 03:07.320
Well, excuse me, but I don't
want to make a big investment

03:07.321 --> 03:09.823
until I have a sense
of where things are going.

03:09.824 --> 03:12.091
Plus, the parking
is free.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.192
Here you go.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.161
Thank you.

03:15.162 --> 03:17.130
Okay, well, good catching up.

03:17.131 --> 03:18.498
If you're going for that swim,

03:18.499 --> 03:20.200
make sure you tuck
your driver's license

03:20.201 --> 03:22.368
in your crack so I can
identify your body.

03:25.639 --> 03:29.407
I mean, is it so much to ask
to make a connection with
another human being?

03:29.408 --> 03:31.009
No, it's not.

03:31.010 --> 03:33.611
I'm not even looking
for sex. I just want a
little companionship.

03:33.612 --> 03:34.845
That's rough. Buy a dog.

03:34.846 --> 03:36.880
You said I couldn't have
a dog in the house.

03:36.881 --> 03:40.181
Fine. Buy a dog and move.

03:40.182 --> 03:41.782
You know what would be great?

03:41.783 --> 03:44.618
If you could find a dog
with its own house.

03:44.619 --> 03:47.455
What's taking
you so long?

03:47.456 --> 03:48.589
Oh, hi, Alan.

03:48.590 --> 03:50.591
How was your date?
Awful.

03:50.592 --> 03:52.727
Oh, I'm sorry.
You want to talk about it?

03:52.728 --> 03:54.562
No. He's going
for a swim.

03:54.563 --> 03:57.698
Well, I-I could use
a friendly ear.

03:57.699 --> 04:01.001
Of course. Now tell me, this
is the girl you met online?

04:01.002 --> 04:03.836
Uh-huh. "Perky Dodger
fan in Tarzana""

04:03.837 --> 04:07.040
So what happened?
First of all, she wasn't
so much perky as porky.

04:08.242 --> 04:10.143
More like a Dodger Dog fan.

04:10.144 --> 04:12.512
Don't you hate it when people
misrepresent themselves?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.313
I do. When someone
makes a date with

04:14.314 --> 04:16.281
"Buff Malibu doctor,"
that's just what they get.

04:16.281 --> 04:18.182
(indistinct conversation)

04:18.183 --> 04:20.250
Apparently,
even when the cat's here,

04:20.250 --> 04:22.119
the mice have to masturbate.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:32.566 --> 04:34.133
Hey.

04:34.134 --> 04:35.902
Hey.

04:37.271 --> 04:38.772
Watching some football?

04:38.773 --> 04:40.607
No fooling you.

04:44.580 --> 04:46.314
Who are we rooting for?

04:46.315 --> 04:48.082
The spread.

04:50.086 --> 04:54.622
Ah, so we're making
an illegal wager.

04:54.623 --> 04:56.491
Technically.

04:56.492 --> 04:59.194
Don't get me wrong,
I'm not judging.

04:59.195 --> 05:01.930
It's really a victimless
crime, don't you think?

05:05.802 --> 05:07.370
So far.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.708
Sorry.

05:16.948 --> 05:19.350
Heard any good
jokes lately?

05:19.351 --> 05:21.687
Yeah.

05:21.688 --> 05:24.792
Two brothers are
sitting on a couch.

05:24.793 --> 05:28.295
One of them says,
"Heard any good jokes lately""

05:28.296 --> 05:29.930
And then the other one--

05:29.931 --> 05:34.001
get this-- the other
one lights him on fire.

05:42.879 --> 05:44.746
Okay, we'll just
watch the game.

05:44.747 --> 05:46.982
Thank you.

05:48.351 --> 05:50.152
All right, it's
a commercial.

05:50.153 --> 05:51.887
Now you can talk.

05:51.888 --> 05:54.355
Well, I was thinking,
with Chelsea out of town...

05:54.356 --> 05:57.691
Hold on, hold on, it's that
baby that trades stocks.

05:57.692 --> 06:00.694
I love this kid.

06:00.695 --> 06:01.695
(chuckles)

06:01.696 --> 06:03.496
Look at this...

06:08.235 --> 06:09.702
Okay, go ahead.

06:09.703 --> 06:13.906
I was thinking, with Chelsea
out of town,

06:13.907 --> 06:16.776
that maybe, you know,
after the game...

06:16.777 --> 06:20.180
you and I could go out
and grab a bite to eat.

06:20.181 --> 06:21.582
No, thanks.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.050
Not hungry?

06:23.051 --> 06:25.286
Don't like you.

06:25.287 --> 06:28.523
Oh, come on,
I need some human contact.

06:28.524 --> 06:29.824
(doorbell ringing)

06:29.825 --> 06:31.292
That's probably a human.

06:31.293 --> 06:33.127
Go contact them.

06:36.164 --> 06:38.064
That was clever.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.066
I'm a clever guy.

06:41.501 --> 06:42.835
Well, hey, buddy.
You're here early.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.637
Oh, I was thinking,
that if you're hungry,

06:44.638 --> 06:47.038
you and I could grab
a bite to eat and...
(door closing)

06:47.039 --> 06:48.440
Maybe later.

06:48.441 --> 06:51.710
He's been a little crabby
since his girlfriend dumped him.

06:51.711 --> 06:54.346
The kid's a stone-cold
bummer, Alan.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.349
Okay, well, thanks
for dropping him off.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.751
You're welcome.
Oh, hey, Herb,

06:59.752 --> 07:03.255
by any chance, do you want to
go out and maybe grab a bite?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.157
Really? You and me?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.259
Sure. Why not?

07:06.260 --> 07:07.760
That's kind of weird, isn't it?

07:07.761 --> 07:10.129
I mean, you're the ex-husband,
I'm the current.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.998
So we've got
something in common.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.232
We do, don't we?

07:13.233 --> 07:14.367
Right.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.536
Neither one of us is
having sex with Judith.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.104
(laughing)

07:21.308 --> 07:23.675
That's actually a little
too close to home.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.976
Sorry.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.378
So what do you think?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.579
I could eat.

07:27.580 --> 07:28.947
Let's go.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.448
Uh, you ever been
to Kabob Kingdom?

07:30.449 --> 07:33.684
At the food court?
I love that place.

07:33.685 --> 07:34.852
(sportscast playing)

07:34.853 --> 07:37.021
Hey, Berta, would you
grab me a beer?

07:37.022 --> 07:38.256
Sure.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.358
Jake, grab your
uncle a beer.

07:40.359 --> 07:41.827
Let him get it himself.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.996
Sorry. I tried.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.098
Hey, numbnuts, just take a beer
out of the fridge

07:46.099 --> 07:47.299
and bring it over here.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.202
Fine.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.308
Here.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.843
Thank you.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.310
What's with the attitude?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.513
You're the reason
Celeste broke up with me.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.681
You still grinding on that?

08:01.682 --> 08:03.983
Yeah, I'm still grinding on it.
I love her.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.187
Stop it. You love fart jokes
and pie.

08:07.188 --> 08:09.689
Fart jokes, pie and Celeste.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.591
If you hadn't talked me into
hanging out

08:11.592 --> 08:13.626
with that other girl,
I'd still have all three.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.461
Oh, come on, pal.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.430
At your age, relationships
aren't serious.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.366
They're just, you know,
puppy love.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.401
No, no, this wasn't puppy love.

08:21.402 --> 08:23.803
This was... dog love.

08:23.804 --> 08:27.474
Trust me, you have not had
dog love yet.

08:27.475 --> 08:30.109
I don't even think your father's
had dog love yet.

08:30.110 --> 08:34.046
Not unless you count
getting bitch slapped.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.616
I promise you'll get over this.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.551
You'll meet somebody else.

08:38.552 --> 08:40.285
You'll love her,
she won't love you.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.988
She'll love you,
you won't love her.

08:41.989 --> 08:44.190
You'll love each other, but
she's married to a cop

08:44.191 --> 08:46.926
who catches you in a motel room
and beats you near to death

08:46.927 --> 08:48.661
with his big police flashlight.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.363
The point is,

08:51.364 --> 08:53.666
you've got a lot of living
to do, right, Berta?

08:53.667 --> 08:57.002
You don't want to
piss off a cop.

08:58.438 --> 08:59.738
Thanks, Uncle Charlie.

08:59.739 --> 09:02.008
You've really given me
a lot to think about.

09:02.009 --> 09:05.177
Hey, hey, hey, nobody
likes a smartass.

09:10.950 --> 09:15.020
Not so sexy when it
happens to you, is it?

09:15.021 --> 09:18.090
âª Men. âª

09:18.091 --> 09:20.025
I give up, Herb.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.561
How do you tell
a kabob to be quiet?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.796
Shh... kabob.

09:24.797 --> 09:28.334
Very clever.
Very clever.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.535
Well, when you're
a pediatrician,

09:29.536 --> 09:31.504
you need to have a lot
of kid-friendly jokes.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.406
Sometimes when I use
the little reflex hammer,

09:33.407 --> 09:35.441
I pretend I'm an Indian.

09:35.442 --> 09:37.576
(chanting)

09:37.577 --> 09:41.179
It's not politically correct,
but the tykes love it.

09:41.180 --> 09:42.213
Oh, boy.

09:42.214 --> 09:44.215
I wish my doctor had
a sense of humor.

09:44.216 --> 09:46.150
Every time I have a prostate
exam, I say,

09:46.151 --> 09:48.453
"What, you're not going to buy
me dinner first?"

09:48.454 --> 09:49.720
And nothin',

09:49.721 --> 09:51.222
not even a smile.

09:51.223 --> 09:53.324
Really? 'Cause that's a beaut.

09:53.325 --> 09:54.826
That's what I thought.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.795
But most people
just don't get me.

09:56.796 --> 10:00.231
Well, that's their loss.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.670
(ringtone playing "I've Been
Working on the Railroad")

10:05.671 --> 10:07.138
Excuse me.

10:07.139 --> 10:09.140
Uh-oh.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.443
Hi, Judith.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.679
I, uh, just stopped
for a bite to eat.

10:14.480 --> 10:16.581
I know you have
leftover meat loaf.

10:16.582 --> 10:18.517
Probably left over from when
I was married to her.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.852
Shh, shh, shh.

10:21.087 --> 10:22.855
What?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.924
That was Alan.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.158
Yes, that Alan.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.493
Hi, Judith.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.830
No, no, Jake's not here.
It's just the two of us.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.333
No, I have not
lost my mind.

10:33.334 --> 10:35.035
Whoa, whoa.

10:35.036 --> 10:36.137
Calm down.

10:36.138 --> 10:37.906
Judith, calm down.

10:37.907 --> 10:40.275
Can we talk about this
when I get home?

10:40.276 --> 10:42.778
All right, bye.

10:42.779 --> 10:46.015
She says hi back.

10:46.016 --> 10:47.349
Sorry to get you in trouble.

10:47.350 --> 10:48.884
Oh, no trouble. I'm a grown man.

10:48.885 --> 10:51.353
And I think I can have lunch
with whoever I want.

10:51.354 --> 10:52.888
Right.

10:52.889 --> 10:54.890
So, how's the chiropractor biz?

10:54.891 --> 10:56.025
Well, it's been a little slow,

10:56.026 --> 10:57.661
you know, with the economy
and everything,

10:57.662 --> 10:59.663
but I'm starting to see
a little turnaround,
and it's been...

10:59.664 --> 11:01.065
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

11:08.007 --> 11:09.975
âª Men. âª

11:09.976 --> 11:11.810
(acoustic guitar playing
soft chords)

11:11.811 --> 11:14.813
JAKE:
âª Oh, Celeste,
you are the best âª

11:14.814 --> 11:20.753
âª With you I was blessed,
but I failed the test âª

11:20.754 --> 11:27.160
âª And now I'm depressed,
Celeste... âª

11:27.161 --> 11:33.500
âª You might as well take
my heart âª

11:33.501 --> 11:36.636
âª Out of my chest âª

11:36.637 --> 11:38.638
âª And mail it... âª

11:38.639 --> 11:41.775
âª All the way to Budapest âª

11:43.444 --> 11:45.145
(knocking)

11:45.146 --> 11:46.179
Got a minute?

11:46.180 --> 11:47.246
I'm busy.

11:47.247 --> 11:48.414
Yeah, I heard.

11:48.415 --> 11:49.915
Budapest.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.517
Very catchy.

11:51.518 --> 11:53.152
What do you want?

11:53.153 --> 11:56.354
I want to apologize for sending
you down a bad road

11:56.355 --> 11:57.489
with your girlfriend.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.290
Yeah, well, forget it.
I'm gonna get her back.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.291
Well, good, good.

12:00.292 --> 12:01.392
So what's the plan?

12:01.393 --> 12:02.493
I'm gonna finish writing my song

12:02.494 --> 12:03.927
and then I'm gonna sing it
to her.

12:03.928 --> 12:07.263
Okay, uh,
is that the entire plan?

12:07.264 --> 12:08.331
No.

12:08.332 --> 12:10.800
I'm also gonna put on
a clean shirt.

12:10.801 --> 12:13.470
Ooh, pulling out the big guns.

12:13.471 --> 12:15.806
Yep.

12:15.807 --> 12:17.874
Can I offer an alternative plan?

12:17.875 --> 12:19.943
I don't want to hear
any more plans from you.

12:19.944 --> 12:21.045
Understandable.

12:21.046 --> 12:22.880
I'd be a little
skeptical in your shoes,

12:22.881 --> 12:24.081
but just hear me out.

12:24.082 --> 12:27.919
The song, good as it is,
it smacks of desperation.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.656
Thank you.

12:30.657 --> 12:33.159
Uh, no, no.

12:33.160 --> 12:36.462
I mean, girls don't generally
respond to desperation.

12:36.463 --> 12:37.731
How do you know?

12:37.732 --> 12:39.966
Are you kidding?
I've been watching your father

12:39.967 --> 12:41.602
get shot down for 25 years.

12:41.603 --> 12:44.671
It's like living with
an Air Force training film.

12:47.209 --> 12:50.911
Listen, if you really want to
get Celeste back, you man up,

12:50.912 --> 12:52.313
go over to her house,

12:52.314 --> 12:54.381
admit you made a mistake
with the other girl,

12:54.382 --> 12:56.617
you realize now
that Celeste is
one in a million,

12:56.618 --> 12:58.218
blah, blah, blah,
and if she doesn't

12:58.219 --> 12:59.719
ever wanna see you again,
you understand.

12:59.720 --> 13:01.988
<i>And then sing her the song?</i>

13:01.989 --> 13:04.790
Forget the song.

13:04.791 --> 13:06.625
Okay.

13:06.626 --> 13:09.494
Do I really say
"blah, blah, blah"?

13:11.497 --> 13:13.765
âª Men. âª

13:13.766 --> 13:15.767
Alan, wait!

13:15.768 --> 13:17.035
You forgot your kabob.

13:17.036 --> 13:18.236
Oh. Oh, thank you.

13:18.237 --> 13:19.237
You're welcome.

13:19.238 --> 13:20.772
And thanks again
for driving.

13:20.773 --> 13:21.806
It was fun.

13:21.807 --> 13:23.607
Oh, yeah,
I had a good time, too.

13:23.608 --> 13:24.642
I'm glad.

13:24.643 --> 13:27.077
So... we should
do it again sometime.

13:27.078 --> 13:28.612
I'd like that.

13:28.613 --> 13:30.648
Great, great.
You know, I'm gonna go

13:30.649 --> 13:32.950
to the flea market tomorrow.
You wanna join me?

13:32.951 --> 13:34.452
Tomorrow?

13:34.453 --> 13:36.254
Oh, gee, I don't know.

13:36.255 --> 13:38.390
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's probably too soon.

13:38.391 --> 13:40.726
No, no.

13:40.727 --> 13:42.428
No, it's not, it's just...

13:42.429 --> 13:43.796
Judith. I know, I know.

13:43.797 --> 13:45.331
I'm just not sure
what to tell her.

13:45.332 --> 13:47.400
Well, you can tell her
the truth.

13:47.401 --> 13:50.236
What is the truth, Alan?

13:50.237 --> 13:52.673
That we're friends.

13:52.674 --> 13:54.875
We are friends, aren't we?

13:55.744 --> 13:56.777
Okay, friend.

13:56.778 --> 13:57.978
I'll see ya tomorrow.

13:57.979 --> 13:59.881
It's a date.

14:02.484 --> 14:04.319
(chuckles)

14:05.688 --> 14:07.989
(chuckles)

14:09.592 --> 14:11.926
(chuckles) Oh! Jake,
Jake, hi, buddy. Um...

14:11.927 --> 14:15.296
I don't care.
I got my own problems.

14:19.884 --> 14:25.588
âª Oh, Celeste, I am congested âª

14:25.589 --> 14:32.160
âª With love
for my Celeste... ed âª

14:33.062 --> 14:34.929
âª Yeah âª

14:34.930 --> 14:36.831
(knocking)

14:36.832 --> 14:38.065
Did you talk to her?

14:38.066 --> 14:39.000
Yeah.

14:39.001 --> 14:39.734
How'd it go?

14:39.735 --> 14:41.369
Not so good.

14:41.370 --> 14:43.404
You sang that song, didn't you?

14:43.405 --> 14:44.939
No, I did exactly what you said.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.141
I told her I'm sorry,

14:46.142 --> 14:47.876
I made a mistake
with that other girl

14:47.877 --> 14:49.912
and she's one in a million,
blah, blah, blah.

14:49.913 --> 14:51.147
Okay, just to be clear,

14:51.148 --> 14:53.282
you didn't really say
"blah, blah, blah"?

14:53.283 --> 14:55.218
I'm not an idiot, Uncle Charlie.

14:55.219 --> 14:57.988
No, no, of course not.
Then what?

14:57.989 --> 15:01.058
Then I said if she never wants
to see me again, I'd understand.

15:01.059 --> 15:01.992
And what'd she say?

15:01.993 --> 15:04.027
"I never want to see you again""

15:04.028 --> 15:05.595
Ouch.

15:05.596 --> 15:06.730
Ouch? That's it?

15:06.731 --> 15:07.864
That's all you've got?

15:07.865 --> 15:10.132
Well, you know,
look at the bright side.

15:10.133 --> 15:11.667
You got a great song out of it.

15:11.668 --> 15:14.069
Ten more girls peein' on you,
you got an album.

15:15.204 --> 15:17.238
Or a fetish.

15:18.374 --> 15:20.708
Okay, well...

15:20.709 --> 15:23.243
say no to drugs.

15:25.112 --> 15:26.613
âª Men. âª

15:27.615 --> 15:29.015
(doorbell chimes)

15:32.453 --> 15:33.720
Oh, hey, Judith.

15:33.721 --> 15:35.221
Just came by
to pick up Herb.

15:35.222 --> 15:36.856
We're going
to the flea market.

15:36.857 --> 15:38.824
No, you're not.

15:38.825 --> 15:40.292
What do you mean?
I just talked to him.

15:40.293 --> 15:42.695
Look, Alan, I discussed it
with Herb and we decided

15:42.696 --> 15:45.064
that it's not in anyone's best
interest for you two

15:45.065 --> 15:46.132
to be spending time together.

15:46.133 --> 15:48.868
You both decided that, huh?
Yes.

15:48.869 --> 15:50.670
Well, if you don't mind,
I'd like to hear it from Herb.

15:50.671 --> 15:52.039
I do mind.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.175
The two of you hanging out is
wrong. It's unnatural.

15:54.176 --> 15:57.011
Excuse me, but I have done
a few unnatural things

15:57.012 --> 15:59.213
in my day,
and this is not unnatural.

15:59.214 --> 16:00.648
Good-bye, Alan.

16:00.649 --> 16:03.184
<i>Our marriage,
that was unnatural!</i>

16:03.185 --> 16:06.121
You can't do this, Judith!

16:06.122 --> 16:08.256
You cannot keep us apart!

16:08.257 --> 16:11.159
Herb and I will find a way
to be together!

16:13.362 --> 16:15.063
Hi.

16:15.064 --> 16:16.397
Hi.

16:16.398 --> 16:18.933
That must've sounded
kinda strange.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.535
Not at all.

16:20.536 --> 16:22.303
Herb is a very handsome man.

16:25.440 --> 16:28.008
âª Men. âª

16:28.009 --> 16:31.311
Hey, I brought you
another soda.

16:31.312 --> 16:33.780
Thanks.

16:35.383 --> 16:37.116
(sighs)

16:37.117 --> 16:41.554
Believe me, Jake,
you'll get over Celeste.

16:41.555 --> 16:43.889
I don't wanna get over her.
I think she was the one.

16:43.890 --> 16:45.625
The one what?

16:45.626 --> 16:48.127
The one, you know,
who was pretty and liked me

16:48.128 --> 16:50.697
and maybe was gonna let me
do stuff to her someday.

16:50.698 --> 16:53.466
And you think there's only one
of those out there?

16:53.467 --> 16:54.734
What do you think?

16:54.735 --> 16:58.472
It doesn't matter what I think.

16:58.473 --> 17:02.376
Jake, you gotta start looking
at this differently.

17:02.377 --> 17:06.179
Women are kinda like
the little boxes of cereal

17:06.180 --> 17:07.913
in one of those
variety packs.

17:07.914 --> 17:09.214
I like the variety packs.

17:09.214 --> 17:10.281
I know you do.

17:10.282 --> 17:11.983
But they should put in more
sugary cereals

17:11.984 --> 17:13.417
and less cereals
that help you poop.

17:13.419 --> 17:15.253
No argument.

17:15.255 --> 17:19.558
But my point is, a variety pack
approach gives you a choice.

17:19.559 --> 17:21.092
It's really not
that great a choice.

17:21.093 --> 17:22.359
In a pack of eight,

17:22.361 --> 17:24.262
there's always at least
three poopin' cereals.

17:24.262 --> 17:26.196
Okay, we're getting away
from the point.

17:26.198 --> 17:27.565
What's your favorite cereal?

17:27.566 --> 17:28.900
It used to be Frankenberry,

17:28.901 --> 17:31.569
but I'm kind of on
a Froot Loops kick now.
Terrific.

17:31.570 --> 17:33.304
They don't get
soggy as fast.
Got it.

17:33.305 --> 17:34.872
Plus the milk
tastes better afterward.

17:34.873 --> 17:36.574
Okay, okay, okay.

17:36.575 --> 17:39.678
So imagine Celeste is
Froot Loops.

17:39.679 --> 17:41.146
You like her now,

17:41.147 --> 17:43.916
but who's to say she isn't
tomorrow's Frankenberry?

17:43.917 --> 17:45.118
You're wrong.

17:45.119 --> 17:46.653
Celeste will always be
my Froot Loops.

17:46.654 --> 17:48.554
You can't know that.

17:48.555 --> 17:49.756
Look at me.

17:49.757 --> 17:51.725
I've been with a lot
of women,

17:51.726 --> 17:54.261
but I only just recently found
the love of my life.

17:54.262 --> 17:56.130
Well, no disrespect,
but I don't wanna wait

17:56.131 --> 17:57.698
until I'm as old and hard up

17:57.699 --> 17:59.600
as you are
to find a good girlfriend.

18:01.102 --> 18:03.236
What?
I said no disrespect.

18:03.237 --> 18:07.573
You know, you make it really
difficult to love you sometimes.

18:07.574 --> 18:09.741
Yeah, that's what
my mom says.

18:14.179 --> 18:17.281
Told ya I'm not an idiot.

18:19.418 --> 18:21.719
âª Men. âª

18:25.424 --> 18:27.492
(hushed):
Herb!

18:27.493 --> 18:30.128
Herb!

18:34.868 --> 18:36.069
(thud)

18:37.104 --> 18:38.538
Alan?

18:38.539 --> 18:39.673
Over here!

18:43.176 --> 18:44.543
Alan...

18:44.544 --> 18:46.878
I didn't want you to think
that I stood you up.

18:46.879 --> 18:49.414
Oh, I know you'd never do that.

18:49.415 --> 18:51.049
Judith just doesn't understand.

18:51.050 --> 18:52.450
I know, and I'm sorry.

18:52.451 --> 18:54.552
But what are we gonna do?

18:54.553 --> 18:56.053
I don't know.

18:56.054 --> 19:00.224
Well, maybe I'll see you
when I bring Jake back.

19:00.225 --> 19:02.192
That'd be nice.

19:02.193 --> 19:05.395
Bye.

19:05.396 --> 19:06.997
Bye.

19:06.998 --> 19:09.032
Alan, wait!

19:09.033 --> 19:10.734
I'm coming with you!

19:10.735 --> 19:12.203
But how?

19:14.039 --> 19:16.241
Be careful, you big galoot.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.809
I'm okay. I'm okay!

19:17.810 --> 19:19.378
(creaking)

19:19.379 --> 19:20.913
I'm not okay!

19:20.914 --> 19:21.914
(thud)

19:21.915 --> 19:24.583
Oh, God! Herb, talk to me!

19:24.584 --> 19:25.651
(groans)

19:25.652 --> 19:27.652
What's going on out here?!

19:30.823 --> 19:33.424
Alan, wait! Take me with you!

19:33.425 --> 19:35.326
âª Men. âª

19:36.946 --> 19:39.081
(TV plays)
I miss Celeste.

19:39.082 --> 19:40.449
I miss Chelsea.

19:40.450 --> 19:42.752
I miss Herb.

19:44.288 --> 19:47.157
<i>Uh, I mean, I mean,
Sex and the City.</i>

19:47.158 --> 19:49.092
<i>I miss Sex
and the City.</i>

19:49.093 --> 19:51.594
Yeah, Alan,
that's much less gay.

19:53.397 --> 19:56.833
I guess that's just what
our lives have come down to;

19:56.834 --> 19:58.502
three pathetic,
lonely guys

19:58.503 --> 20:01.971
watching television
on a Sunday night.

20:01.972 --> 20:04.207
Oh, crap, it's Sunday night!

20:04.208 --> 20:05.909
Chelsea's flying into LAX!

20:05.910 --> 20:07.143
You gonna pick her up?

20:07.144 --> 20:10.347
No, I'm gonna call her a cab
and take a Viagra.

20:10.348 --> 20:13.951
Well, buddy, I guess
it's you and me.

20:13.952 --> 20:17.888
No disrespect, Dad, but that
just makes it worse.

20:19.190 --> 20:21.625
I said no disrespect.

20:21.626 --> 20:23.193
Why doesn't that ever work?

20:23.194 --> 20:26.596
(phone rings)

20:28.065 --> 20:29.398
Hello?

20:29.399 --> 20:31.401
Yeah, this is Jake.

20:31.402 --> 20:32.802
Oh, hi, Nicole.

20:33.904 --> 20:35.905
Yeah, I broke up with Celeste.

20:35.906 --> 20:37.073
Now?

20:37.074 --> 20:39.275
Sure. See ya in a few.

20:40.110 --> 20:41.811
I'm gonna go meet Nicole
at the pier.

20:41.812 --> 20:42.745
Who's Nicole?

20:42.746 --> 20:44.980
I'm not really sure.

20:48.785 --> 20:50.553
(sighs)

20:52.323 --> 20:57.894
âª I remember you... âª

20:59.797 --> 21:07.705
âª You're the one who made
my dreams come true. âª

21:11.910 --> 21:13.644
(doorbell rings)
(music stops)

21:17.181 --> 21:19.315
Herb.

21:19.316 --> 21:20.649
We haven't got much time.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.317
Judith thinks
I'm in physical therapy.

21:22.318 --> 21:24.553
Well, then let's make
the most of it.
