Richard, if I believe           
that staying with Isabelle

would save all those lives,     
I would marry her tomorrow.     

01:30.156 --> 01:33.408
  But what happens if she gets  
tired of me or I make her angry?

01:33.409 --> 01:36.128
There are things I was sent here

        Four days.              

03:51.029 --> 03:53.265
             I have to offer you
              a word of caution.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.949
                This cigar,     

03:54.950 --> 03:57.051
             when you smoke it, 

03:57.052 --> 03:59.253
          you might be surprised
              by its effects.   

03:59.254 --> 04:02.523
Oh, I'm not gonna get arrested  
for having this, am I?          

04:02.524 --> 04:04.109
                Of course not.  

04:04.110 --> 04:06.044
            About a year        
            after we returned,  

04:06.045 --> 04:08.446
                I learned       
            I have an ability.  

04:08.447 --> 04:10.415
          When I come in contact
              with a person,    

04:10.416 --> 04:13.785
        they sometimes see      
    a vision of their future.   

04:13.786 --> 04:15.120
                  I see nothing,
                    understand. 

04:15.121 --> 04:16.620
             Only those I touch.

04:16.622 --> 04:19.541
              But I'm told      
    it can be quite accurate.   

04:19.541 --> 04:21.309
That's a nice talent.           
                    ( chuckles )

04:21.310 --> 04:22.544
                     Thank you. 

04:22.545 --> 04:24.929
                I grew          
            this tobacco myself.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.832
            It's been in contact
            with my hands.      

04:27.833 --> 04:31.636
              And so it contains
                  my ability.   

04:31.637 --> 04:34.289
Wait, so what you're saying is, 
    if I smoke this cigar,      

04:34.290 --> 04:36.841
I'm gonna see the future?       

04:36.842 --> 04:38.209
                Your future. A--

04:38.210 --> 04:40.378
         A possible one, anyway.

04:40.379 --> 04:42.931
                As I said,      
            use with caution.   

04:42.932 --> 04:44.716
              You might not like
                 what you see.  

04:44.717 --> 04:48.319
But it seems an appropriate gift
 for a man on his wedding day.  

04:48.320 --> 04:50.454
Well, it is better              
than a toaster oven.

 His body was completely

    at the molecular level.

 happens when metal rusts.

                  Exactly.      

07:20.872 --> 07:23.958
         Well, almost exactly.

07:56.357 --> 07:58.158
They ran the composite sketch   
of the driver                   

07:58.159 --> 08:00.160
against their database          
of 4400s.                       

08:00.161 --> 08:02.362
      No matches.               
        Anything from Forensics?

08:02.363 --> 08:04.264
No. Well, they pulled           
a couple partial prints         

08:04.265 --> 08:07.034
off the safety pin that held    
the note to the kid's jacket.   

08:07.035 --> 08:08.318
But nothing we can              
make an ID from.                

08:08.319 --> 08:09.720
      Okay, what about the note?

08:09.721 --> 08:11.806
    It's a deliberate message   
      to whoever found the body.

08:11.807 --> 08:13.591
        That's typical

Yeah, but it says "27."         

08:15.143 --> 08:17.544
There can't be 26 other corpses 
like Tim McCarren's out there.  

08:17.545 --> 08:19.146
          Even one would make it
              onto our radar.   

08:19.147 --> 08:21.082
         So we'll talk          
to McCarren's friends, families.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.084
              Maybe he's got    
         a connection to a 4400.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.436
 Diana, there is one other thing
    I wanna talk to you about.  

08:25.437 --> 08:27.037
        You got plans on Sunday?

08:29.458 --> 08:31.776

  to Shawn's wedding w-with you?

you might be interested.

        a professional courtesy.

      to put it.

I mean, would you wanna be      
 on the bride's bad side?

        to welcome her

into this elite training unit.  

14:50.639 --> 14:52.506
 He couldn't tell me            
    much about it,              

14:52.507 --> 14:54.274
just that it meant              
he was being transferred        

14:54.275 --> 14:56.894
  off the frontlines            
and out of harm's way.          

14:56.895 --> 14:59.213
     And he was killed in action
        soon after that?        

14:59.214 --> 15:00.964
     Two weeks later.           

15:02.334 --> 15:05.436
The Army told me he'd been      
flying a recon mission          

15:05.437 --> 15:08.606
in an OH-58 helicopter.         

15:08.607 --> 15:11.142
Got hit by an RPG.              

15:11.143 --> 15:13.277
They never did find             
    his remains.

                I'm so sorry,   
                Mr. Piersahl.   

15:15.564 --> 15:18.765
  But you said the Army told you
  he was flying a recon mission.

15:18.766 --> 15:20.868
         Did you have any reason
              to doubt that?    

15:20.869 --> 15:22.336
        Well, I thought         
    the timing was peculiar.    

15:22.337 --> 15:23.804
    I mean, I just got          
      this letter from him      

15:23.805 --> 15:25.156
  saying he was done fighting.  

15:25.157 --> 15:26.823
So I did some checking.         

15:26.824 --> 15:29.043
There were six soldiers         
reported dead                   

15:29.044 --> 15:30.694
in the crash                    
that killed my son.             

15:30.695 --> 15:32.713
                 And why is that
                     unusual?   

15:32.714 --> 15:35.666
Because an OH-58 flies          
with a crew of four.            

15:35.667 --> 15:37.684
It can't hold six people.       

15:40.138 --> 15:41.555

15:41.556 --> 15:43.591

    suspicious circumstances?   

15:43.592 --> 15:45.759
     There's something off here.
    Even the kid's dad knows it.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.227
    It's weird,                 
I'm not denying it.             

15:47.228 --> 15:49.697
But let's just take our time    
with this, okay?                

15:49.698 --> 15:52.399
There are other explanations    
that don't involve cover-up.    

15:52.400 --> 15:54.251
Someone coulda planted          
Piersahl's fingerprints         

15:54.252 --> 15:56.119
at the crime scene. Who knows?  
It could be a 4400,

someone who can mimic           
other people's fingerprints.    

15:58.323 --> 16:00.090
     Maybe, but if you're trying
          to frame someone,     

16:00.091 --> 16:01.359

  That could be a coincidence.

            is induced.         

19:11.249 --> 19:15.101
      Right. Starting in 1969,  
Seattle Presbyterian Hospital

 used a flawed radiation machine
 to treat their cancer patients.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.974
     You know, the microswitches
      that controlled the thing 

19:19.975 --> 19:22.193

      The dosages were all off.

How long did this go on?        
          Just under five years.

Once the hospital figured out   
    what they were doing,       

19:26.398 --> 19:28.932
      they tested everyone      
who had ever been exposed to it.

19:28.933 --> 19:31.952
    In some cases, the radiation
      induced a small mutation.

            The Starzl Mutation.

19:33.488 --> 19:34.404

     passed it on to their kids,

19:52.090 --> 19:53.340
                There was       
         a class-action lawsuit.

Seattle Presbyterian paid       
    a huge settlement

      by the machine.

you out of marrying Isabelle.

No, that was my decision,

 it would have taken me hours.

Oh, some guy                    
in a suit showed up.            

22:24.125 --> 22:26.626
He had a document saying that   
the military needed the file

in the war on terror.

            to fake two deaths. 

27:16.134 --> 27:18.035

                  and Shaffner

could disappear into the program
         with impunity.

So we have a second member      
of Haspel Corp's program. Great.

27:23.590 --> 27:25.792
    But it doesn't get us       
  any closer to Darren Piersahl.

27:25.793 --> 27:27.294
MARCO:                          
Good point.                     
It doesn't.                     

27:27.295 --> 27:29.129
      Not until...              

27:29.130 --> 27:32.532
                 you look       
         at Shaffner's dog tags.

27:32.533 --> 27:35.102
  This is Shaffner's            
military serial number.         

27:35.103 --> 27:38.037
Look familiar?                  
                  Uh, should it?

27:39.440 --> 27:41.474
         Twenty-seven.          
      That's what the note      

27:41.475 --> 27:43.143
  we found on Tim McCarren said.

27:43.144 --> 27:44.528
That's also where               
we found his name               

27:44.529 --> 27:47.397
on the list of people           
with Starzl Mutation.           

27:47.398 --> 27:50.033
             Eleven.            
 That was Paula Nakata's number.

27:50.034 --> 27:52.385
    And Holly Martins was 92    
on the list. There is a pattern.

27:52.386 --> 27:54.721
  He's picking the order based  
 on his buddy's serial number.  

27:54.722 --> 27:56.289
      Okay, but why?            

27:56.290 --> 27:59.258
Maybe it's a message. Uh,       
maybe they're doing it together.

27:59.259 --> 28:01.093
But if he's consistent,         
the next victim                 

28:01.094 --> 28:03.830
 will be number 38              
on the Starzl list.             

28:03.831 --> 28:05.131
                Alex Messina.   

28:05.132 --> 28:08.401
I checked him out. He manages   
  a bike store in Madrona.      

28:10.671 --> 28:12.639
                    MESSINA:    
                Yeah. Yeah,     
                I recognize him.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.140
                  He was in here
                  earlier today.

28:14.141 --> 28:16.810
Did he say anything to you?     
 It was kind of weird, actually.

28:16.811 --> 28:18.811
             He asked me        
    if my name was Alex Messina.

28:18.812 --> 28:20.946
    And he said it like that.   
        You know, the full name.

28:23.217 --> 28:24.534
              He wanted to know 
             if I could come out

28:24.535 --> 28:26.019
              and take a look   
            at his bike.        

28:26.020 --> 28:27.053
                He needed       
              to replace a part.

28:27.054 --> 28:28.772
                 I told him just
                 to bring it in.

28:28.773 --> 28:31.358
          He said he'd come back
         when we were less busy.

28:35.196 --> 28:38.398
Send a tactical team over       
right away. Thanks.             

28:38.399 --> 28:40.700
If Piersahl makes a move,       
we'll be ready.                 

28:42.503 --> 28:43.537
                  Tom.          

28:45.506 --> 28:47.591

    Do you like this color?     

29:02.557 --> 29:04.107
          This place needs to be
            a little more girly

                living here.    

29:08.179 --> 29:09.863
     Yeah, it looks great.      

29:09.864 --> 29:11.297
     I think so too.            

29:12.867 --> 29:14.401
  I'm glad you're back.         

29:23.828 --> 29:25.128
If Piersahl knows               
we're on to him,                

29:25.129 --> 29:26.596
he'll change                    
his pattern of attack.          

29:26.597 --> 29:28.131
          There's a dozen people
              we can't find.    

29:28.132 --> 29:30.000

My name is John.

 I was a volunteer in the same  
program Darren Piersahl was in. 

29:42.146 --> 29:44.630
The one that drove him crazy.   
      Yeah, we know who you are.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.151
             And we know        
          about the program.    

29:48.152 --> 29:49.335
         Good.                  

29:50.988 --> 29:53.773
 Then you're ready to hear      
    what I have to say.         

29:53.774 --> 29:55.458
( <i>dramatic theme playing</i> )      

30:00.864 --> 30:03.683
      We were volunteers,       
        all of us.              

30:03.684 --> 30:05.518
        I still remember        
        the sales pitch.        

30:05.519 --> 30:08.088
            We'd be the elite,  
          a new type of soldier.

30:08.089 --> 30:10.624
    We had to give up our lives,
    forfeit our identities.     

30:10.625 --> 30:11.941
        They said               
      it was the only way.      

30:11.942 --> 30:14.794
The program had to operate      
      in complete secrecy.      

30:14.795 --> 30:16.546
When did you start              
getting the injections?         

30:16.547 --> 30:19.198
Right away. Started slow,       
but about three weeks ago       

30:19.199 --> 30:20.800
      they started upping       
          our dosages.          

30:20.801 --> 30:23.136
             That's when guys   
          started to...lose it. 

30:23.137 --> 30:24.370
 Where'd they get the promicin? 

30:24.371 --> 30:26.022
I don't know,                   
but they have plenty of it.     

30:26.023 --> 30:29.226
      Darren was the first one  
who could do stuff, you know?   

30:29.227 --> 30:30.693
            An-- An ability.    

30:30.694 --> 30:32.495
        He killed one           
  of the instructors by mistake.

30:32.496 --> 30:34.647
          It freaked him out.   
    You two escaped together?   

30:34.648 --> 30:36.983
Once we got out, we pretty much 
went our separate ways.         

30:36.984 --> 30:39.286
         I had no idea          
     he was gonna do this.      

30:39.287 --> 30:40.419
                So he's AWOL?   

30:40.420 --> 30:42.155
            These murders       
    aren't sanctioned by anyone?

30:42.156 --> 30:43.456
                    No,         
        Darren's freelancing.   

30:43.457 --> 30:44.757
              That's why        
      they want him back so bad.

30:44.758 --> 30:46.793
     He's compromising          
    the program.                

30:46.794 --> 30:49.162
        Our C.O.s, they told us 
      about the Starzl Mutation.

30:49.163 --> 30:50.496
             They told us       
        it could be a threat,   

30:50.497 --> 30:52.265
          but they never told us
             to kill anybody.   

30:52.266 --> 30:53.549
    Then what is it?            

30:53.550 --> 30:56.052
    Why does Darren             
want them dead so badly?        

30:56.053 --> 30:58.755
Got something to do with babies.

30:58.756 --> 31:01.391
         So far, any time a 4400
                has a kid       

31:01.392 --> 31:03.526
             with a member      
      of the regular population,

31:03.527 --> 31:04.761
        their babies are normal.

31:04.762 --> 31:06.863
They don't make promicin        
or have abilities.              

31:06.864 --> 31:08.497
             We know, we've been
            tracking the births.

31:08.498 --> 31:10.650
But the Starzl Mutation         
changes all that.               

31:10.651 --> 31:11.734
    If a 4400 has a kid         

31:11.735 --> 31:14.003
        with someone            
who has the mutation,           

31:14.004 --> 31:16.406
     the baby would be          
    promicin-positive.          

31:16.407 --> 31:18.108
          They'd have abilities.

31:18.109 --> 31:20.092
How would the military          
know that? Have they tried it?  

31:20.093 --> 31:22.495
              SHAFFNER:         
     I don't know, but they seem
        pretty sure it's true.  

31:22.496 --> 31:24.080
      I know this is gonna      
          sound crazy,          

31:24.081 --> 31:26.632
but Darren is a victim here too.

31:26.633 --> 31:28.418
They gave us so many stimulants.

31:28.419 --> 31:30.837
    They amped us up to kill    
        and he snapped.         

31:30.838 --> 31:33.005
 Now, I don't know if he thinks 
he's on a mission or something, 

31:33.006 --> 31:34.507
      but I know he needs       
         to be stopped.         

31:34.508 --> 31:36.760
         I'll do whatever I can 
          to help you find him. 

31:36.761 --> 31:39.129
            DENNIS:             
 <i>So, what do you think you know?</i>

31:39.130 --> 31:42.799
          Everything.           
 Including the Starzl Mutation. 

31:42.800 --> 31:44.601
        And I have              
      to give you credit.       

31:44.602 --> 31:46.436
If what you say is right,       

31:46.437 --> 31:49.889
it would explain why the 4400   
was sent back in 2004.          

31:49.890 --> 31:51.975
Why they were all               
brought to Seattle.             

31:51.976 --> 31:53.609
          This is the only place
          the 4400 can reproduce

31:53.610 --> 31:56.229
and have kids with abilities.   
    Any of this sound familiar? 

31:56.230 --> 31:58.998
  I think I read the same theory
  in a supermarket tabloid once.

31:58.999 --> 32:03.169
  We know about your enhanced   
    soldier program, Dennis.    

32:03.170 --> 32:04.621

    for many roll calls lately? 

32:11.328 --> 32:14.130
Well, as soon                   
as we have Piersahl,            

32:14.131 --> 32:15.331
we're going public              
with this,                      

32:15.332 --> 32:17.166
  and there's nothing           
you can do to stop that.        

32:18.135 --> 32:19.552
All you can do                  

32:19.553 --> 32:21.972
 is make yourself and this      
company look slightly better    

32:21.973 --> 32:24.724
by cooperating with our efforts 
to bring him in.                

32:24.725 --> 32:26.376
We want Piersahl's              
    personnel file.             

32:26.377 --> 32:27.927
Everything you have.            

32:27.928 --> 32:30.230
If it's not in my hands         
    in 90 seconds,              

32:30.231 --> 32:31.598
Shaffner will be standing       
            in front

This could be something. Maybe. 

32:41.492 --> 32:43.360
    It reads like some kind     
     of personal statement.     

32:43.361 --> 32:45.829
 An essay by Piersahl.          

32:45.830 --> 32:47.831
    Yeah, we had to do those    
     to get in the program.     

32:47.832 --> 32:49.748
    They wanted us to write     
    about some goal we achieved,

32:49.749 --> 32:51.300
                something       
            we were proud of.   

32:51.301 --> 32:53.403
    This is all about           
a volunteer program that he did.

32:53.404 --> 32:56.439
There was a patch of forest     
that got cleared by a fire.     

32:56.440 --> 32:59.842
Piersahl volunteered to renew it
so that he could become a--     

32:59.843 --> 33:01.961
Darren Piersahl                 
was an Eagle Scout?             

33:01.962 --> 33:04.564
      Yeah, he used to talk     
 about those woods all the time.

33:04.565 --> 33:06.298
      When we were in the middle
            of the program,     

33:06.299 --> 33:07.867
             whenever things    
             got really bad,    

33:07.868 --> 33:10.136
 he used to tell me that's where
    he'd go in his head.        

33:10.137 --> 33:12.439
     He'd imagine himself there,
         it calmed him down.    

33:12.440 --> 33:14.707
This patch of forest,           
any chance you know where it is?

around her, Mr. Tyler.          

33:26.904 --> 33:28.872
That's great.                   

33:28.873 --> 33:31.775
     The magazine wants to get  
  a shot of the bride and groom.

33:31.776 --> 33:33.243
      Has anyone seen the groom?

    Your own bodyguard.

You started a war,

You turned the 4400             
into an army,                   

34:14.952 --> 34:17.786
and you launched                
an attack for no reason!        

34:17.788 --> 34:19.422
We didn't have a choice.        

34:19.422 --> 34:22.425
        It had to be            
    a preemptive strike.        

34:22.426 --> 34:23.476
"No choice."

        It has to stop.

  She didn't change me.

 She showed me who I am.

36:09.617 --> 36:11.951
  That's good,                  
I need your help.

    I'm never gonna make it

          Darren, you don't have
            to finish the list. 

36:17.541 --> 36:19.141
     It's someone else's agenda.

36:19.142 --> 36:21.177

  in your head. Come on with me,

             to talk to.

                  Wait!

    We lost Shaffner,           

38:11.337 --> 38:12.955
        Piersahl's dead.        

38:12.956 --> 38:15.541
     He was on his way out      
before we even started fighting.

38:15.542 --> 38:18.076
    Piersahl had a stab wound   
            in his stomach.     

38:18.077 --> 38:20.613
 I guess Shaffner didn't go down
         without a fight.       

38:20.614 --> 38:22.681
        Yeah. Well,             
     they're both gone.         

38:22.682 --> 38:24.784
        And there's no one left 
      to talk about the program.

38:24.785 --> 38:26.202
         We still have evidence.

38:26.203 --> 38:27.936
    We can go after Haspel Corp.

But it would have been nice     
to have a face to put out there.

Now all we have are accusations 
    and a paper trail.          

38:33.377 --> 38:35.094
     And five dead bodies.

                  TOM:          
        The press conference was
         a clever move, Dennis. 

39:42.679 --> 39:44.947
        I have to give credit   
              where it's due.   

39:44.948 --> 39:48.384
          But this company      
has five bodies on its hands.   

39:48.385 --> 39:51.120
         And I'm gonna make sure
            everyone knows it.  

39:51.121 --> 39:52.822
      Knows what?               

39:52.823 --> 39:54.674
We're not denying anything.     

39:54.675 --> 39:57.427
 It's unfortunate that one      
    of my men went AWOL,        

39:57.428 --> 39:58.811
but he was clearly deranged.    

39:58.812 --> 40:01.113
And I've got a whole team       
of doctors standing by          

40:01.114 --> 40:02.598
to testify to that effect.      

40:02.599 --> 40:04.267
    You created an assassin.    

40:04.268 --> 40:05.634

        I'll admit that.        

40:07.521 --> 40:09.404
But tomorrow morning,           
  the Piersahl case             

40:09.405 --> 40:11.441
will be below the fold          
 on every newspaper.            

40:11.442 --> 40:14.393
And all the headlines           
will be about our program.      

40:14.394 --> 40:16.279
 That's the way I see it,       
         anyway.

         Wait, who's feeding you
            your information?

        Mutation before we did. 

40:20.901 --> 40:22.935
         You have a source

too much credit, Tom.
