00:17.284 --> 00:18.751
Mal!

00:20.754 --> 00:22.020
You okay?

00:22.055 --> 00:23.755
Of all the words
I can think of,

00:23.790 --> 00:25.924
"okay" is not even
in the top ten.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.359
Guess you didn't
find your jewel.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.293
Nope.

00:29.296 --> 00:30.562
You want to talk about it?

00:30.597 --> 00:33.398
Mm. I'll just see you later.

00:33.433 --> 00:35.434
I'll just give you
some space then.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.137
I'll be right here,
giving you space.

00:46.746 --> 00:49.381
-(pop music playing)
-(girls chattering)

00:49.416 --> 00:52.184
Okay! Okay!
Everyone, listen up.

00:52.219 --> 00:55.454
I've worked really hard
on the song and dance
for the Jewel-bilee.

00:55.489 --> 00:59.224
So I really need everybody
to step up and give 110 percent.

00:59.259 --> 01:00.425
Or else.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.460
Or else what?

01:01.495 --> 01:03.162
Or off with their heads!

01:04.598 --> 01:05.764
Too much?

01:05.799 --> 01:08.366
I just want you to watch me
and follow my lead.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.235
Why should today
be any different?

01:10.270 --> 01:12.071
(giggles) Oh.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.273
-(music begins)
-And two, three, four.

01:15.308 --> 01:16.608
Whoo!

01:21.181 --> 01:23.615
-Ooh! Aah!
-That's different.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.952
(groaning) Whoa!
Stop it, leg.

01:26.987 --> 01:28.954
Okay, that's a weird move.

01:28.989 --> 01:30.388
So, like this?

01:30.423 --> 01:33.058
No! I'm not doing this.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.926
Not doing it well, maybe.

01:34.961 --> 01:36.261
-Oh!
-Aah!

01:36.296 --> 01:38.096
Hey, watch the genie pants.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.397
I'm out of control!

01:39.432 --> 01:41.066
Is this still part
of the routine?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.367
(groans)

01:43.370 --> 01:45.137
(all groaning)

01:45.172 --> 01:46.671
Ow!

01:46.706 --> 01:49.608
Well, it started kind of slow,
but I loved the big finish.

01:49.643 --> 01:53.245
Somebody magicked me.
Mal?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.413
Audrey, why would Mal
do that to you?

01:55.448 --> 01:58.717
'Cause she's jealous
that she doesn't get to be
a part of all this.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.586
Mal's not like that anymore.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.689
If she's still evil,
then I'm still plain.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.324
Um...

02:06.359 --> 02:08.460
Okay, Mal, the gag was funny,
but you do not want

02:08.495 --> 02:10.362
to get between Audrey
and her big show.

02:10.397 --> 02:13.131
As your BFF,
I have to advise you
to chill.

02:13.166 --> 02:16.368
You're right, Evie.
That would be
the nice thing to do.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.809
Okay, I admit the song
got off to a rocky start.

02:24.844 --> 02:28.313
But with
my eternal vigilance-
slash-amazing directing,

02:28.348 --> 02:30.182
I think it could
look really-- (gasps)

02:30.217 --> 02:31.483
(Audrey screams)
