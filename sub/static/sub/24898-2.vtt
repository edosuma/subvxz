Here to see Detective Sam Shaw.

00:20.982 --> 00:22.732
Well, she's usually

- Yeah.

Uh, no. Excuse me, Mr. Carter.

00:30.378 --> 00:32.119
No civilians allowed past this point.

that case wide open.

him to join the police force.

There was no breaking
and I hardly entered.

11:07.481 --> 11:08.904
Harley, this is serious.

11:08.929 --> 11:11.169
If they press charges,
there's nothing I can do about it.

11:11.342 --> 11:13.037
I'm sorry I made you miss your EMTys.

11:13.062 --> 11:16.800
Damn! It is him! Harley Carter!

11:17.052 --> 11:18.910
Hey... you!

11:18.942 --> 11:20.222
We love your show.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.581
We watch it every Thursday
and then I record it.

11:22.606 --> 11:26.268
I have watched the nudist colony
episode a half dozen times.

11:26.293 --> 11:28.276
I thought there had to
be some kind of mistake,

11:28.327 --> 11:31.227
but damn! Chuck Hancock.

11:31.321 --> 11:34.149
This is my wife, Bedelia.
We own the factory.

11:34.446 --> 11:35.761
I know everyone says this,

11:35.830 --> 11:37.685
but I really am your biggest fan.

11:37.710 --> 11:40.826
Well, word is you've seen the
nudist colony episode six times.

11:40.851 --> 11:42.833
Oh. (CHUCKLING)

11:42.858 --> 11:45.330
Mr. and Mrs. Hancock. Detective Shaw.

11:45.355 --> 11:47.136
Mr. Carter has made a huge mistake.

11:47.161 --> 11:48.880
He sure has. He shoulda called ahead.

11:48.905 --> 11:50.577
We'd have rolled out the red carpet.

11:51.088 --> 11:53.063
So, you're not pressing charges?

11:53.088 --> 11:55.047
No, no. It's a misunderstanding, right?

11:55.072 --> 11:57.028
What are you doing here
in the first place?

11:57.053 --> 11:59.285
Uh, well, I actually wanted
to ask you a few questions.

11:59.329 --> 12:00.764
That he will ask some other time.

12:00.789 --> 12:01.906
What kind of questions?

12:01.931 --> 12:03.548
We really got to go, folks.

12:03.916 --> 12:05.440
Has this woman ever worked for you?

12:09.017 --> 12:10.093
Oh...

12:11.579 --> 12:13.467
No, no. This is a woman whose...

12:14.551 --> 12:17.118
whose body was found in my old factory.

12:17.415 --> 12:19.329
Her son killed her

12:19.354 --> 12:22.439
and then, he set the place on fire.
It was a terrible tragedy.

12:29.733 --> 12:31.255
CHIEF: Go ahead. Take a look.

12:34.893 --> 12:36.789
Brett Johnson did set the fire?

12:37.056 --> 12:38.111
Killing his mother.

12:38.286 --> 12:40.321
Something you would've
known if you'd asked.

12:40.578 --> 12:41.961
Harley was just trying to help.

12:42.099 --> 12:44.429
Brett says someone else
killed his mother.

12:44.454 --> 12:46.151
Someone botched this investigation.

12:46.176 --> 12:47.279
It was my investigation.

12:47.304 --> 12:48.908
- Get him out of here.
- SAM: Yeah.

12:49.138 --> 12:50.194
Well, if Brett did do it,

12:50.219 --> 12:51.764
why did he only serve five years?

12:51.922 --> 12:53.303
Brett was never in jail.

12:53.328 --> 12:55.235
It was determined he'd
had a psychotic break.

12:55.260 --> 12:56.510
Up until a few months ago,

12:56.760 --> 12:58.537
he was in a psychiatric hospital.

12:58.700 --> 12:59.724
Harley, come on.

12:59.924 --> 13:01.773
Now, if you continue to
poke your nose in this

13:01.798 --> 13:03.079
or any other case,

13:03.454 --> 13:05.627
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get you Brett's old room.

13:09.773 --> 13:12.995
<i>♪♪</i>

13:20.126 --> 13:21.904
Sam, Sam, hey.

13:22.452 --> 13:24.810
I got you an apology coffee.

13:25.451 --> 13:26.560
Apology accepted.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.825
It's actually an apology
for what I'm about to say.

13:29.373 --> 13:31.052
Something's bugging me
about this Brett thing,

13:31.076 --> 13:32.677
the case the Chief said he cracked...

13:32.702 --> 13:34.713
No. No way.

13:34.790 --> 13:37.742
If he did it, why would
he ask me to investigate?

13:37.834 --> 13:40.199
Because, you heard the Chief,
Brett's not well.

13:40.224 --> 13:42.014
He isn't, but he's not dangerous.

13:42.088 --> 13:45.951
And he needs our help.
I think he's telling the truth.

13:45.976 --> 13:50.883
Okay, "Brett's truth" and "the
truth" are two different things.

13:50.908 --> 13:52.565
Right, and you are able

13:52.590 --> 13:54.374
to tell the difference,
being a cop and all.

13:54.399 --> 13:56.763
So, you want me to talk to him.

13:57.177 --> 13:58.287
I made him a promise.

13:58.570 --> 13:59.857
A Harley Carter promise?

13:59.882 --> 14:01.795
A promise is a promise. Look, I...

14:02.032 --> 14:04.084
I totally could have gone
there myself this morning,

14:04.109 --> 14:06.280
but I was like, "I don't
want to get Sam in trouble."

14:06.305 --> 14:07.610
Harley, I'm working.

14:07.703 --> 14:11.022
Yes, but your shift doesn't
start for, like, an hour.

14:11.047 --> 14:12.731
Okay? You're the early bird.

14:13.222 --> 14:14.668
Let's go get that worm.

14:15.893 --> 14:17.321
The Chief does not hear about this.

14:17.346 --> 14:19.091
Like he listens to me anyway.

14:19.116 --> 14:20.392
All right, let's make it quick.

14:20.951 --> 14:22.360
(EXHALING SHARPLY)

14:24.806 --> 14:25.931
MAN: Would you shut up?!

14:26.263 --> 14:27.701
This place is cheery.

14:28.084 --> 14:30.765
FYI... I tend to save my
sarcasm for the idle rich

14:30.790 --> 14:32.023
and not the working poor.

14:32.515 --> 14:33.961
Burn. Point taken.

14:34.733 --> 14:36.475
(EXHALING SHARPLY)
What are you thinking?

14:36.624 --> 14:38.569
I wouldn't be here if I was thinking.

14:38.862 --> 14:41.080
(COUPLE ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)

14:41.164 --> 14:42.606
(BUZZING)

14:46.813 --> 14:48.141
Oh, Detective Shaw.

14:48.166 --> 14:49.817
Are you here for the suicide?

14:50.454 --> 14:51.466
What apartment?

14:51.709 --> 14:54.058
Uh, 405. No signs of forced entry.

14:54.083 --> 14:55.978
Nothing missing. Kid named...

14:56.406 --> 14:58.790
"Brett Johnson." Shot himself.

15:10.796 --> 15:13.211
(SIGHING) Thanks for the lift.

15:14.118 --> 15:15.249
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

15:16.180 --> 15:18.702
There's no way you could
have known he was so fragile.

15:28.098 --> 15:30.627
Hey, what are we doing here?

15:32.096 --> 15:34.497
I don't believe Brett killed himself.

15:34.522 --> 15:36.224
He thought I was Charlie Carter.

15:36.374 --> 15:37.778
Well, you never mentioned that.

15:38.366 --> 15:41.039
He thought that Charlie Carter
had taken his case. He had hope.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.797
Why would he go home and kill himself?

15:42.822 --> 15:44.806
Well, so what's with this place?

15:45.024 --> 15:47.393
Well, he worked here. Used to.

15:48.432 --> 15:50.339
Okay. Well, let's go see what we see.

15:50.403 --> 15:51.424
But I run this.

15:54.416 --> 15:56.668
Thank you for agreeing
to see us, Mr. Conrad.

15:57.073 --> 15:58.123
PETE: Pete, please.

15:58.777 --> 16:00.236
So, what was his name again?

16:00.464 --> 16:01.758
Brett Johnson.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.814
Oh, young guy.

16:04.089 --> 16:06.307
He was in a mental care facility.

16:06.706 --> 16:09.479
Sure, I, uh... I know him.

16:10.073 --> 16:12.169
He was hired as part
of our rehabilitation

16:12.194 --> 16:15.482
and re-entry program,
doing custodial work.

16:16.449 --> 16:18.388
When was the last time you saw him?

16:18.556 --> 16:19.857
I couldn't say, really.

16:20.142 --> 16:21.723
Why? Is he in some kind of trouble?

16:22.068 --> 16:23.843
We found his body this morning

16:23.868 --> 16:26.082
and I just need to get a
little more background on him.

16:27.123 --> 16:29.027
We're treating his death as suspicious.

16:29.508 --> 16:31.526
No offense, but why am I
having this conversation

16:31.551 --> 16:32.877
with a TV actor?

16:32.984 --> 16:34.947
You're having this conversation with me.

16:35.799 --> 16:37.200
Did you know Brett well?

16:37.225 --> 16:40.495
No. No. I know he had troubles,

16:40.520 --> 16:43.711
but my policy here is to
give people a second chance.

16:44.010 --> 16:45.555
(PHONE RINGING)

16:46.722 --> 16:48.562
Well, thanks, Mr. Conrad.

16:48.828 --> 16:50.692
Nicole needs to talk to me.
I think you should come.

16:50.716 --> 16:51.999
And if we need anything else,

16:52.087 --> 16:53.691
- I will let you know.
- PETE: Of course.

16:55.801 --> 16:57.067
I'm no just a TV actor.

16:57.092 --> 16:59.043
I was also in an independent film

16:59.068 --> 17:02.622
that was officially selected
at the North Bay Film Festival.

17:05.348 --> 17:06.599
NICOLE: Lack of gunshot residue

17:06.625 --> 17:08.671
confirms the gun wasn't
fired by the deceased.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.736
Someone killed him.

17:09.954 --> 17:11.361
Preliminary ballistic reports

17:11.386 --> 17:13.398
show that the only fingerprints
on the gun were Brett's.

17:13.423 --> 17:14.494
Well, that's not possible

17:14.520 --> 17:16.237
because Koji also handled the gun.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.064
When Brett came to my house,

17:19.089 --> 17:20.861
he had the gun and
Koji took it from him.

17:20.886 --> 17:22.804
So, how did it end up in his apartment?

17:22.829 --> 17:23.868
I gave it back to him.

17:23.999 --> 17:25.699
A man repeatedly calls
you "Charlie Carter"

17:25.723 --> 17:27.371
and you give him his gun back?

17:27.632 --> 17:29.767
As you're so fond of
reminding me, I'm not a cop

17:29.792 --> 17:32.459
and didn't believe it was within
my rights to confiscate his gun.

17:32.838 --> 17:35.017
So, somebody shot him,

17:35.042 --> 17:37.034
wiped the gun clean and
put the gun in his hand.

17:39.268 --> 17:40.863
Hey, Nicole, where's that medallion

17:40.888 --> 17:42.066
that was around his neck?

17:42.265 --> 17:44.410
There was no jewellery on
him when he was brought in.

17:46.414 --> 17:48.485
And there's no mention
of anything listed here.

17:48.865 --> 17:51.026
But there is a slight abrasion
on the side of his neck.

17:51.247 --> 17:53.765
Maybe caused by someone pulling it off?

17:56.109 --> 17:57.693
The killer didn't take his TV

17:57.718 --> 17:59.948
or his laptop,
but he did take his medallion.

17:59.973 --> 18:02.728
Oh, it's personal, definitely.
Let me take this to the Chief.

18:02.753 --> 18:03.847
No, no, no. Sam,

18:03.872 --> 18:05.848
I feel like the Chief has
already let Brett down once.

18:05.872 --> 18:09.159
- Harley Carter!
- Mayor Hamilton.

18:09.184 --> 18:12.003
Oh, please tell me you're here
to help out on another case.

18:12.028 --> 18:14.380
Oh, just the opposite.
He was leading my department

18:14.405 --> 18:16.223
on a wild goose chase
and I shut it down.

18:16.248 --> 18:17.331
All due respect, Chief,

18:17.356 --> 18:19.741
I feel like we are
really onto something.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa. There's no
"we" that includes you and me.

18:22.036 --> 18:23.770
And civilians aren't
supposed to be back there.

18:23.794 --> 18:25.618
You know what? Forget
about the due respect.

18:26.891 --> 18:29.118
I feel like you...
you botched this case once

18:29.143 --> 18:31.461
and history is repeating itself. Sam...

18:31.742 --> 18:34.295
You're gonna leave this station
house now or I will arrest you.

18:34.320 --> 18:36.105
If I find out that you're
still poking your nose

18:36.129 --> 18:37.741
around this case, I will arrest you.

18:37.766 --> 18:39.721
- If you interfere with police...
- Angus...

18:40.110 --> 18:42.413
I accept, Mayor Hamilton.

18:43.093 --> 18:44.101
Pardon me?

18:44.126 --> 18:46.566
Your offer? I accept.

18:46.897 --> 18:48.042
- Oh!
- Grace...

18:48.890 --> 18:52.073
Chief Pershing, we need to have
a big picture conversation.

18:52.118 --> 18:53.602
This is a bad move.

18:53.627 --> 18:55.044
This is a big move,

18:55.069 --> 18:57.049
one Bishop could really use right now.

18:57.141 --> 18:58.591
Perhaps you wouldn't be saying that

18:58.624 --> 19:00.186
if this wasn't an election year.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.509
Mr. Carter,

19:04.774 --> 19:06.235
as of this moment,

19:06.260 --> 19:09.895
you are officially a Consulting
Detective with the Bishop PD,

19:09.920 --> 19:14.340
and the police will
extend you every courtesy.

19:16.409 --> 19:18.026
You understand I had to do that, right?

19:18.051 --> 19:19.912
- Was it worth it?
- Well, I'm official now,

19:19.937 --> 19:21.508
which means I'm officially his problem.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.345
- It takes the heat off of you.
- (CHUCKLING)

19:23.642 --> 19:25.861
We both know that is
not why you did that.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.784
Look, my hands are untied
and that is a good thing.

19:29.260 --> 19:30.283
(SIGHING)

19:30.308 --> 19:32.626
So, let's go talk to Brett's roommate.

19:32.925 --> 19:35.307
Nothing about that apartment
said roommate to me.

19:35.681 --> 19:38.064
Oh, well, except for this.

19:40.099 --> 19:42.361
You took mail from Brett's apartment?

19:42.386 --> 19:43.902
Consultant in Season Two taught me

19:43.927 --> 19:45.972
how to jimmy open a mail
box using a credit card.

19:46.606 --> 19:49.170
Oh, come on. I ruined, like,
three credit cards to get this.

19:49.195 --> 19:50.918
Plus, I thought maybe
Brett had a relative

19:50.943 --> 19:52.009
that we should be contacting.

19:52.033 --> 19:53.656
Well, that's not your responsibility.

19:54.031 --> 19:56.531
But useful and thoughtful.

19:56.616 --> 19:58.164
Well, I aim to please.

19:58.220 --> 20:01.929
And a violation of Section
356 of the Criminal Code,

20:01.954 --> 20:03.627
so your aim is a little off.

20:04.127 --> 20:06.656
Let's go see what
this Greg Yates has to say.

20:10.963 --> 20:12.182
HARLEY: Mmm.

20:15.987 --> 20:17.862
I love stakeouts.

20:18.706 --> 20:20.055
Have you ever been on a stakeout?

20:21.305 --> 20:24.192
I love sitting in cars and eating.

20:24.594 --> 20:27.095
Hey, stay focused, okay?

20:27.179 --> 20:28.992
It's not like he's going to just pop up.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.827
There he is.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.975
Okay, here's... here's the plan.

20:39.158 --> 20:40.942
- Harley!
- Hey, stop!

20:40.967 --> 20:41.970
Police!

20:43.773 --> 20:45.640
Oh my God!

20:46.665 --> 20:47.900
Harley, wait!

20:49.478 --> 20:50.556
Hey!

20:53.631 --> 20:54.701
Get back here!

We can talk all about
that at the station.

21:16.082 --> 21:18.046
You might want to think
about a gym membership.

21:18.130 --> 21:21.049
Oh, sorry. I didn't really
get a chance to stretch out.

21:21.133 --> 21:24.314
"Freeze while I warm up!"
Let's see how that works.

21:29.429 --> 21:30.647
I was out of town.

21:32.632 --> 21:34.596
I didn't know Brett was
dead till you told me.

21:35.105 --> 21:36.298
Why'd you run?

21:36.808 --> 21:38.643
Let me guess. You're on probation.

21:38.668 --> 21:39.728
Actually I don't have to guess

21:39.752 --> 21:42.296
because that's what my computer
told me when I typed your name in.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.249
My computer also told me
that you're not supposed

21:44.274 --> 21:48.210
to leave the city or...
steal Brett's pills.

21:49.029 --> 21:50.046
What do you want?

21:50.577 --> 21:52.258
Brett said he was scared,

21:52.283 --> 21:53.415
that someone was after him.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.697
Did you ever see or hear
anybody threaten him?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.314
No, I mean, I thought he was
making all that stuff up.

21:59.556 --> 22:02.023
Look, I just crashed there
a couple times, okay?

22:02.632 --> 22:03.882
And we weren't friends.

22:04.243 --> 22:06.015
I really didn't know him that well.

22:12.336 --> 22:14.354
Think I know someone who might.

22:21.743 --> 22:23.527
The courts are clear
in cases like Brett's.

22:23.563 --> 22:25.605
Where there's no prison term mandated,

22:25.670 --> 22:26.866
the patient must remain

22:26.891 --> 22:30.341
in a facility like this until he
or she no longer poses a threat.

22:30.443 --> 22:32.747
Did anyone come visit him
over the last five years?

22:32.772 --> 22:34.022
I'd have to look that up.

22:34.047 --> 22:36.491
SAM: Thank you. And what
was Brett's diagnosis?

22:36.684 --> 22:38.364
Paranoid schizophrenia.

22:38.434 --> 22:39.792
It was a very blurry line

22:39.817 --> 22:41.659
between fantasy and reality for Brett.

22:41.831 --> 22:43.417
We helped him as best we could.

22:43.706 --> 22:44.745
May I?

22:49.288 --> 22:51.840
SAM: Are all of these about
the night his mom died?

22:51.892 --> 22:53.349
It's how he remembered it.

22:53.604 --> 22:56.177
DR. WATERS: He was found outside
the factory with burns to his hands.

22:56.201 --> 22:57.568
Smelling like gasoline.

22:57.593 --> 22:59.905
But when a patient can't
accept what they've done,

22:59.930 --> 23:02.148
they often try to create
a fictional version.

23:02.902 --> 23:04.773
Brett said that someone
else started the fire.

23:04.798 --> 23:07.235
Could that be this hooded person?

23:07.863 --> 23:10.080
Before we got him on the
right combination of meds,

23:10.105 --> 23:12.056
Brett's thinking was disordered,

23:12.551 --> 23:14.369
sometimes illogical.

23:14.461 --> 23:16.669
Nothing he said can be treated as fact.

23:17.045 --> 23:19.192
Now I'll show you one more thing.

23:22.765 --> 23:24.698
<i>There was someone there
that night. It wasn't me.</i>

23:24.847 --> 23:26.152
<i>It was the lion king.</i>

23:27.832 --> 23:29.097
<i>He grabbed my mom.</i>

23:30.610 --> 23:33.223
<i>He bit her on the mouth
and hypnotized her</i>

23:33.913 --> 23:35.085
<i>so that she couldn't resist.</i>

23:37.473 --> 23:39.828
<i>And then the castle, it started burning.</i>

23:41.590 --> 23:43.583
<i>I ran in to save her, but I couldn't.</i>

23:47.265 --> 23:48.595
<i>Ask the astronaut.</i>

23:49.767 --> 23:51.806
<i>Ask him. He was there. He saw me.</i>

23:52.518 --> 23:53.638
(SIGHING)

23:54.587 --> 23:56.794
Lions and castles and astronauts.

23:57.107 --> 23:59.058
We're not in Kansas anymore.

24:12.043 --> 24:13.560
There's a lion-y kind of thing

24:13.585 --> 24:15.393
on the medallion that
Brett's mother gave him.

24:15.418 --> 24:17.206
It could be connected to this lion king.

24:17.369 --> 24:20.455
Harley, Brett is just a kid
suffering from psychosis.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.286
His words aren't a
series of bread crumbs

24:22.311 --> 24:23.623
that are gonna lead us to Mary's killer.

24:23.647 --> 24:25.384
- I know, but...
- But.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.048
That's all we have to go on for now.

24:27.767 --> 24:30.439
"He bit my mom on the
mouth and hypnotized her."

24:30.464 --> 24:32.482
To a kid struggling with reality,

24:32.660 --> 24:34.166
I read that as a kiss.

24:34.534 --> 24:36.784
You think she was hooking up
with someone at the factory?

24:36.909 --> 24:37.987
I don't know.

24:38.088 --> 24:39.093
Uh, Detective?

24:39.118 --> 24:40.836
Got a call from a Dr. Waters.

24:40.952 --> 24:42.936
Uh, Brett Johnson had no visitors.

24:42.961 --> 24:44.531
But he did get packages.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.913
Nice, Rafalski. From who?

24:46.938 --> 24:48.355
Did we get any return addresses?

24:48.380 --> 24:49.663
Uh, all from the same address.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.005
- I looked it up.
- Oh!

24:51.690 --> 24:54.284
Ugh, no name. All from
a numbered company.

24:54.674 --> 24:56.409
Who would send Brett
packages anonymously?

24:56.434 --> 24:58.877
A relative? Family friend?
Someone who cared about him.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.515
And, uh, Chief wants to see you.

25:00.853 --> 25:02.298
- Okay.
- Thanks.

25:02.801 --> 25:04.919
Uh, just you, Detective.

25:07.394 --> 25:08.890
Hey, Rafalski! Hey!

25:09.398 --> 25:10.601
How would a guy,

25:10.626 --> 25:12.965
well, not just any guy,
a consulting detective,

25:13.046 --> 25:14.426
how would a consulting detective

25:14.451 --> 25:16.102
go about finding a corporation's name

25:16.127 --> 25:17.487
from their corporate number?

25:17.989 --> 25:19.065
Follow me.

25:25.239 --> 25:26.655
DAVE: What are we doing here, Harl?

25:27.559 --> 25:28.600
For five years,

25:28.741 --> 25:31.143
packages coming from that address

25:31.278 --> 25:32.628
were sent to Brett Johnson.

25:32.653 --> 25:34.736
I want to know why.

25:35.154 --> 25:37.088
Hey, what do you know about Pete Conrad?

25:37.246 --> 25:38.277
Pete Conrad?

25:38.679 --> 25:40.371
Ooh, he used to raise
hell back in the day.

25:40.629 --> 25:43.722
I'll tell you this much. I never
expected him to become a good citizen,

25:43.747 --> 25:45.564
much less a successful developer.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.494
- Did he go to school with us?
- No.

25:48.123 --> 25:49.166
No, I met him after.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.853
Oh. During your dark years.

25:52.485 --> 25:54.579
You know what? You don't
talk about my dark years,

25:54.604 --> 25:56.935
and I don't talk about that
hip-hop album you dropped.

25:57.927 --> 26:00.179
No, Pete turned his life
around a couple years back.

26:00.388 --> 26:03.173
Got this business,
does tons of charity work.

26:03.925 --> 26:06.714
Wait, you... you said he was
sending care packages to this kid?

26:06.865 --> 26:08.828
Well, Pete said that
he barely knew Brett.

26:08.853 --> 26:10.752
Why... why would he lie about that?

26:11.664 --> 26:13.967
Here's something that's starting
to feel a little pertinent.

26:14.290 --> 26:16.975
Pete Conrad used to be a firebug.

26:18.547 --> 26:22.375
I have been talking about this
paint factory fire all day,

26:22.400 --> 26:24.488
and now... now you're telling me this?

26:24.513 --> 26:25.945
Hey, man, you're the detective.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.951
I'm just his, you know,
handsome streetwise pal.

26:29.521 --> 26:31.865
Okay, he was a firebug.
What are we talking?

26:31.890 --> 26:34.276
Like, dumpster fires or full-on arson?

26:34.390 --> 26:35.799
Small stuff when I knew him,

26:35.939 --> 26:38.869
but don't arsonists always Jones
for something bigger and better?

26:40.302 --> 26:41.585
Hey, I'm sorry!

26:41.610 --> 26:43.260
The drugstore didn't
have any baby powder.

26:43.569 --> 26:44.682
DAVE: Baby powder?

26:44.850 --> 26:46.056
Your little plan here

26:46.081 --> 26:47.686
doesn't have anything to
do with a baby, does it?

26:47.710 --> 26:49.734
Because, for the record,
that's where I draw the line.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.532
- Stealing babies.
- Let's do this.

26:51.906 --> 26:53.493
Do what? Define this.

26:53.518 --> 26:55.076
We can't break into Pete's office.

26:55.101 --> 26:56.904
We can't "not break in", okay?

26:56.929 --> 26:58.772
And, man, come on, it's...
it's the weekend.

26:58.797 --> 27:01.148
No one's gonna be there, relax.

27:02.594 --> 27:04.668
- What are you doing?
- Come on, let's go.

27:04.693 --> 27:06.358
Hey, hey! It's Bobby
Sobelman's assistant.

27:06.383 --> 27:07.874
They wanna talk bar mitzvah, now.

27:08.026 --> 27:09.210
Right, so talk!

27:09.243 --> 27:10.346
You know what to do.

27:10.371 --> 27:11.773
- Who's the man?
- Me?

27:11.798 --> 27:13.055
- Who's the man?
- Me.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.225
- Oh, my God.
- Who's the man?

27:14.249 --> 27:15.615
- Me! Okay, yeah, yeah.
- Yes, yes.

27:15.640 --> 27:16.865
- And I got your six.
- Oh, really?

27:16.889 --> 27:18.518
Uh, what direction is our six?

27:19.701 --> 27:21.555
I don't know. I just
thought that was a saying.

27:21.607 --> 27:22.757
- Just...
- Dave, come on!

27:22.782 --> 27:23.815
Just keep an eye out.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.394
Ah! (CHUCKLING)

27:31.888 --> 27:33.497
I did this on the show once.

27:36.102 --> 27:37.119
(COUGHING)

27:37.314 --> 27:38.845
What the hell are you doing?

27:38.870 --> 27:42.276
The cinnamon is supposed to reveal
fingerprints on the keyboard,

27:42.301 --> 27:45.554
telling me which numbers to push,
but it's not working.

27:45.685 --> 27:47.552
Hey, can you go back to the
truck and grab some cocoa?

27:47.576 --> 27:49.418
- Harley.
- (SIGHING)

27:50.215 --> 27:52.386
Hey, what year was Pete born?

27:52.471 --> 27:54.775
You... you actually
expect me to know that?

27:55.830 --> 27:57.761
Uh, 1979? I don't know.

28:00.718 --> 28:01.755
No.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.218
Okay, even if that was
correct, there are, like,

28:04.243 --> 28:06.125
a hundred combinations of those numbers.

28:06.634 --> 28:08.448
I... oh, no. Actually, 24.

28:08.602 --> 28:10.183
Well, what are we waiting for?

28:11.146 --> 28:12.163
No, okay.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.493
Third time's the charm.

28:13.983 --> 28:15.035
(BEEPING)

28:15.060 --> 28:16.469
- Uh-oh!
- Uh, Harley?

28:16.494 --> 28:18.015
- Uh-oh, okay, no, no.
- Stop! Stop!

28:18.040 --> 28:19.107
- Stop!
- Harley?

28:19.497 --> 28:20.669
- Come on!
- Harley!

28:23.864 --> 28:27.138
Um, you are under arrest!

28:30.812 --> 28:32.154
Look Bobby,

28:32.179 --> 28:33.507
no Mr. Sullivan and yeah.

28:34.090 --> 28:35.363
Uh, yes, I have.

28:36.926 --> 28:39.175
And now it's your turn to listen to me.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.328
Please? Yeah.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.777
If you think that for one minute,

28:42.802 --> 28:44.402
my client is going to...

28:47.701 --> 28:50.679
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
This can't be happening!

28:50.940 --> 28:52.824
Uh, no, no. Not you, sir.

28:52.909 --> 28:55.445
- I... um, I gotta go, bye!
- (CELL PHONE BEEPING)

28:55.489 --> 28:56.891
You lied to me, Pete.

28:57.273 --> 28:59.838
For five years, you've been
taking care of Brett Johnson,

29:00.149 --> 29:01.312
sending him care packages,

29:01.337 --> 29:03.036
making sure he had a
job when he got out.

29:03.254 --> 29:04.512
And that's a crime?

29:04.537 --> 29:06.723
You know what, let's just
take it easy here, all right?

29:06.823 --> 29:08.132
No, but killing his mom?

29:08.290 --> 29:09.876
- That is a crime.
- Harley.

29:09.901 --> 29:11.395
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

29:11.419 --> 29:13.837
Five years ago, starting dumpster fires

29:13.862 --> 29:16.414
wasn't quite holding the
same excitement it used to,

29:16.439 --> 29:19.058
so you torched the old
Hancock paint factory,

29:19.337 --> 29:21.622
but didn't realize that
Mary Johnson was inside.

29:21.871 --> 29:24.022
Which was an accident, I'm sure.

29:24.107 --> 29:25.624
Sure. It was an accident,

29:25.708 --> 29:27.175
but you were racked with guilt

29:27.236 --> 29:29.613
and made sure that Brett got
everything he ever needed.

29:29.638 --> 29:32.790
Because Pete is a really
nice guy with a real gun.

29:34.432 --> 29:35.482
Penance.

29:35.644 --> 29:37.071
That's what this is all about.

29:37.290 --> 29:38.546
Until Brett came to me,

29:38.684 --> 29:40.435
I reopened the investigation.

29:40.535 --> 29:42.266
You panicked and killed him.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.976
- Harl.
- Yeah, right, again.

29:44.060 --> 29:46.478
It was an accident,
so you make it look like a suicide,

29:46.503 --> 29:48.555
and I'll bet that there is a medallion

29:48.596 --> 29:50.480
sitting right there in that safe!

29:51.219 --> 29:52.758
I can tell you two things.

29:53.748 --> 29:56.004
I've never killed anyone,

29:56.172 --> 29:59.257
and you are never gonna
see what's in that safe.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.142
(GROANING)

30:03.663 --> 30:04.829
Okay, okay.

30:05.079 --> 30:06.166
All right, you know what?

30:06.191 --> 30:08.343
Let's... let's... l-let's
just start over, yeah?

30:08.368 --> 30:09.635
Totally our bad.

30:09.719 --> 30:11.515
TV guy here just got a little excited.

30:12.101 --> 30:15.695
Brett just wanted justice
for his mom, and for that,

30:15.877 --> 30:18.164
he died badly and alone.

30:20.195 --> 30:21.757
So, what's it gonna be, Pete?

30:22.188 --> 30:23.728
The ball's in your court.

30:26.557 --> 30:28.008
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

30:28.033 --> 30:29.334
Harley, Dave?

30:29.503 --> 30:31.293
Outside, now.

30:43.185 --> 30:45.899
You know what really pisses me off
is the fact that if my phone rings,

30:45.924 --> 30:47.508
there is a 50/50 chance

30:47.533 --> 30:48.961
it's gonna be about
getting you out of trouble.

30:48.985 --> 30:51.384
I'm telling you, Pete was shaking.
We were on to something.

30:51.478 --> 30:52.729
Did you just hear what I said?

30:52.806 --> 30:53.845
We were on to something.

30:53.930 --> 30:56.157
We're not on to anything
except leaving, come on.

30:57.868 --> 30:59.551
- Hey, uh...
- Look, don't, don't.

31:00.243 --> 31:01.696
Hey! Great work guarding our six.

31:01.721 --> 31:03.805
Okay, I hung up on the head
of the studio for you.

31:04.806 --> 31:06.860
Are you waiting for me to say that's
the bravest thing I've ever heard?

31:06.884 --> 31:08.501
I got fired, okay?

31:08.526 --> 31:10.277
I'm never gonna work in Hollywood again.

31:10.613 --> 31:12.349
Just relax. Harley will take care of it.

31:12.435 --> 31:14.866
No, no, no. Don't tell him, okay?

31:14.951 --> 31:16.666
This... this is on me.

31:18.242 --> 31:20.727
All right. Come on, get in the truck.
I'll give you a drive.

31:23.059 --> 31:25.310
Yes, I know the case is undercooked,

31:25.394 --> 31:27.058
but that's why we went
to Conrad's office,

31:27.083 --> 31:29.963
to look for evidence linking him
to the fires and to the murders.

31:29.996 --> 31:32.031
Harley, here's what I'm thinking.

31:33.062 --> 31:36.619
I was thinking about how nice
it was to see you the other day,

31:36.806 --> 31:38.156
when you first came into town.

31:38.638 --> 31:41.115
- Re... really?
- Really. Really.

31:41.162 --> 31:45.165
You know, I just had this
quick flash of you and I

31:45.190 --> 31:47.091
sipping iced teas on that dock of yours

31:47.116 --> 31:49.814
and just talking about
each other's day and...

31:50.019 --> 31:51.659
Well... well, this can be our day.

31:51.684 --> 31:53.502
This is our day, every day.

31:53.527 --> 31:56.135
And then... and then, just
now, when you said that,

31:56.351 --> 32:00.204
I had this flash of tying you

32:00.367 --> 32:02.172
to the back bumper of my car

32:02.197 --> 32:04.279
and just gunning it down Rankin Road.

32:04.304 --> 32:06.440
Just windows open and I'm screaming.

32:06.714 --> 32:08.086
Sounds like I'd be screaming, too.

32:08.171 --> 32:09.689
Ideally, yeah.

32:11.076 --> 32:14.285
All I'm saying is you should
have seen Conrad's face

32:14.310 --> 32:16.261
when I brought up Brett Johnson.

32:18.551 --> 32:20.191
Okay. Lay it out.

32:20.216 --> 32:21.933
Means, motive, opportunity.

32:22.018 --> 32:25.237
Okay, we already established
that Conrad is a firebug, means.

32:25.321 --> 32:28.165
Okay, and the file says
that there's no security

32:28.190 --> 32:31.109
at the old Hancock paint factory,
so that is opportunity.

32:31.134 --> 32:32.918
So, if he started the fire, if,

32:33.196 --> 32:34.332
what was the motive?

32:34.663 --> 32:37.341
Someone paid him?
How else do you explain the jump

32:37.366 --> 32:40.147
from small-time fire starter
to respectable businessman?

32:40.171 --> 32:44.343
Inheritance, lottery,
uh, prudent investments?

32:44.999 --> 32:46.937
But you're right. Pete's acting guilty.

32:47.043 --> 32:48.609
So, who paid him?

32:48.651 --> 32:50.972
Well, who would benefit from
having the old, crumbling,

32:50.997 --> 32:52.935
- Hancock paint factory burn down?
- (DOOR OPENING)

32:52.959 --> 32:54.082
RAFALSKI: Detective?

32:54.869 --> 32:56.154
There's someone here to see you.

33:10.375 --> 33:12.312
My client is present
of his own free will,

33:12.401 --> 33:14.152
and, as such, makes no omissions,

33:14.213 --> 33:15.329
presumed or otherwise.

33:15.354 --> 33:16.904
Further, we ask your acknowledgement

33:16.929 --> 33:18.417
that there are no facts
currently in evidence...

33:18.441 --> 33:19.808
Is she charging you by the word?

33:20.769 --> 33:23.425
What was Harley Carter doing
breaking into Mr. Conrad's safe?

33:23.480 --> 33:25.262
Why don't you tell me
why you're here, Pete?

33:25.839 --> 33:27.894
(CLEARING THROAT) I came
here to come clean.

33:29.054 --> 33:30.816
I've been carrying this for too long.

33:32.630 --> 33:33.665
Okay.

33:35.788 --> 33:37.087
So, let's start over.

33:38.171 --> 33:41.390
Did you burn down the Hancock
paint factory five years ago?

33:42.572 --> 33:43.619
Yes.

33:43.908 --> 33:45.665
Did you kill Mary Johnson?

33:45.690 --> 33:47.580
No, no. I never killed anyone.

33:48.393 --> 33:49.878
Brett was a good kid.

33:50.643 --> 33:53.018
A hard worker, proud of his job.

33:53.566 --> 33:57.567
So, yes, I-I tried to watch over him.

33:57.592 --> 33:59.498
I figured it was the least I
could do after what happened.

33:59.522 --> 34:01.293
Before my client goes any further,
I'd like your assur...

34:01.317 --> 34:03.052
How much did Chuck Hancock pay you?

34:06.910 --> 34:09.027
It was supposed to be quick money.

34:10.185 --> 34:12.027
I found out about the body the next day.

34:12.053 --> 34:13.414
Same as everyone else.

34:14.110 --> 34:16.373
I-I told Chuck that I
was gonna go to the cops.

34:16.399 --> 34:18.315
But her son became a suspect

34:18.400 --> 34:20.289
and he went down for a
crime that you committed.

34:20.531 --> 34:22.875
I knew he wasn't well and needed help.

34:23.725 --> 34:25.244
This way he got it.

34:26.981 --> 34:29.065
That make it easier for you
to sleep all these years?

34:29.478 --> 34:30.587
(SIGHING)

34:31.830 --> 34:33.813
Not for one second.

34:42.888 --> 34:45.752
I mean, if Pete didn't know
that Mary Johnson was present

34:45.784 --> 34:47.935
when he set the fire,
then what she doing there?

34:48.447 --> 34:52.177
Brett said that the lion king
took his mother to the castle.

34:52.601 --> 34:56.128
Yeah, but does Chuck Hancock
strike you as the lion king type?

34:56.505 --> 35:00.017
I mean, yeah, he benefits from
having his factory burn down,

35:00.042 --> 35:02.482
but what does that have to do
with Mary Johnson and her death?

35:02.557 --> 35:04.423
- Or Brett's?
- Let's go find out.

35:04.448 --> 35:05.899
(GATE BUZZING)

35:10.446 --> 35:11.460
Hey!

35:11.524 --> 35:12.930
(GASPING) Oh, Harley Carter!

35:12.955 --> 35:14.639
Coming in the front door this time.

35:14.664 --> 35:17.612
- Mrs. Hancock.
- Oh, Bedelia, please.

35:17.649 --> 35:18.818
Is your husband here?

35:18.944 --> 35:21.923
Uh, yes, he's out on the,
uh, spraying floor,

35:21.948 --> 35:24.767
but you're gonna have to
suit up if you go in there.

35:25.503 --> 35:28.289
Um, let me wrap this up
and I'll give you a hand.

35:28.314 --> 35:29.359
Great.

35:30.727 --> 35:32.882
If you're a scared kid,
what does this look like?

35:34.310 --> 35:35.375
An astronaut.

35:35.829 --> 35:37.747
If you're Pete Conrad
and you're about to light

35:37.772 --> 35:39.762
a big ass chemical fire,

35:39.787 --> 35:42.672
you're gonna go full-on astronaut.

35:43.219 --> 35:44.878
Wanna hear something else that's weird?

35:44.903 --> 35:47.331
I mean, not like Harley Carter
moving back to Bishop weird.

35:47.356 --> 35:48.761
Just interesting weird.

35:48.786 --> 35:50.469
Is this gonna forever
change how I look at you?

35:50.493 --> 35:53.214
Pete Conrad was the third
man to walk on the moon,

35:53.239 --> 35:54.479
the third astronaut.

35:55.258 --> 35:56.625
What does that mean?

35:57.125 --> 35:58.142
I don't know,

35:58.167 --> 36:00.303
but I'm really starting to like
how the world is working again.

36:00.327 --> 36:02.896
Okay-dokey, will you
take a selfie with me?

36:02.921 --> 36:04.070
Let's do it!

36:04.407 --> 36:06.179
So, are you the receptionist here?

36:06.204 --> 36:08.550
Yeah, the receptionist,
office manager...

36:08.577 --> 36:10.847
- Great, thank you, yeah.
- In charge of hiring.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.131
Thanks.

36:13.156 --> 36:16.075
Bedelia, I can't help but
notice when hiring around here,

36:16.100 --> 36:19.027
they, uh, tend to be a
very specific type.

36:19.962 --> 36:21.324
You don't miss a trick, do you?

36:21.847 --> 36:25.505
You got me. I am the youngest
gal for miles around.

36:25.853 --> 36:29.196
Let's just say I know
my husband all too well.

36:29.265 --> 36:30.344
Hmm.

36:30.369 --> 36:32.076
If I'm picking up what
you're putting down,

36:32.101 --> 36:33.344
you and I are in the same boat.

36:33.462 --> 36:36.404
I know. I'm so sorry.
I saw the meltdown.

36:38.164 --> 36:40.146
The key is to get payback.

36:40.655 --> 36:46.515
Um, I got a kitchen with
my husband's last affair.

36:46.562 --> 36:49.000
Custom tile, Sub-Zero fridge.

36:49.085 --> 36:50.414
May I? It's, um...

36:50.439 --> 36:53.216
(CLEARING THROAT) It's very fancy, hmm.

36:58.871 --> 37:00.816
What is this animal right here?

37:01.140 --> 37:03.625
Oh, that's the Hancock family crest.

37:03.849 --> 37:06.345
Lots of people think it's a lion,
but it's actually a gryphon.

37:07.323 --> 37:09.564
Huh. We're just gonna
take a peek back there,

37:09.589 --> 37:10.643
see if we can find Chuck.

37:10.668 --> 37:12.456
Um, sure, hon, as long as you suit up.

37:12.641 --> 37:13.718
Thank you.

37:16.726 --> 37:19.531
Is this how good it feels,
always, when you're closing in?

37:19.556 --> 37:21.207
Because this feels amazing.

37:21.671 --> 37:22.734
Doesn't suck.

37:29.783 --> 37:31.036
Right here!

37:32.052 --> 37:33.185
Not him, no.

37:34.718 --> 37:36.402
Up there, Sam! Right there!

37:36.427 --> 37:37.589
I see him.

37:37.614 --> 37:38.965
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

37:38.990 --> 37:40.370
No, no, no!

37:43.930 --> 37:45.169
There, Sam!

37:52.530 --> 37:53.615
- Look,
- I can't...

37:53.640 --> 37:55.285
- Go that side!
- Okay, okay.

37:58.957 --> 38:00.027
No.

38:07.255 --> 38:08.656
Sam, I got him!

38:12.926 --> 38:14.877
Sam, he's coming down the other side!

38:46.287 --> 38:47.998
(GRUNTING)

38:48.662 --> 38:49.740
SAM: Harley!

38:53.867 --> 38:55.851
(SCREAMING)

38:57.859 --> 38:59.969
SAM: Found this when we
searched your office.

39:00.021 --> 39:02.926
You took it off of Brett Johnson's
body after you killed him.

39:02.951 --> 39:06.190
You killed Brett Johnson
because you also killed his mom.

39:07.263 --> 39:08.564
She was gonna ruin me.

39:08.589 --> 39:10.032
Well, you made her promises,

39:10.257 --> 39:12.224
and all she wanted was for
you two to be official.

39:12.249 --> 39:14.240
I was married. She had a crazy kid.

39:14.265 --> 39:18.590
And when she insisted you leave
your wife, Mary had to go,

39:18.615 --> 39:20.730
and what better way to do
it than a chemical fire

39:20.771 --> 39:22.502
where you would also get
the insurance money

39:22.527 --> 39:23.746
to start up a new factory?

39:23.830 --> 39:25.781
CHIEF: You set it all
up with Pete Conrad,

39:25.955 --> 39:27.711
leaving out the significant detail

39:27.736 --> 39:29.509
that there was a dead woman inside.

39:29.655 --> 39:31.639
She was gonna tell my family.

39:33.137 --> 39:35.581
You let Mary's kid
take the fall for you,

39:36.005 --> 39:37.553
and after you ruined Brett's life

39:37.578 --> 39:39.531
and he was starting
over, you killed him.

39:39.867 --> 39:42.913
And if you hadn't taken
this off of his body,

39:43.350 --> 39:44.656
we might not have caught you.

39:46.052 --> 39:47.626
That's my family crest.

39:49.089 --> 39:50.368
It's my legacy.

39:51.323 --> 39:52.821
It's a hell of a legacy.

40:01.049 --> 40:02.952
Are you sure you're gonna stay here?

40:03.036 --> 40:05.056
Yeah, I'm gonna stick around
for a little bit, but, hey,

40:05.080 --> 40:06.196
you're more than welcome to stay.

40:06.220 --> 40:08.944
We're always looking for a driver,
stakeout caterer,

40:08.969 --> 40:11.201
senior or junior sidekick,

40:11.226 --> 40:14.159
but, uh, I can't offer you any
benefits at this time, sorry.

40:14.331 --> 40:18.025
Look, I am truly honoured and
I've loved every moment of this,

40:18.050 --> 40:20.290
but I want to be an agent.

40:21.087 --> 40:23.237
I thought I'd make a
pretty good one, too.

40:23.262 --> 40:25.167
You are a good agent, and someday,

40:25.192 --> 40:27.105
you will be a great agent.

40:27.130 --> 40:30.087
Um, no. Bobby Sobelman
literally used the words,

40:30.112 --> 40:31.870
"You will never work
in this town again."

40:32.098 --> 40:35.329
Well, "never" turned into four
hours because I talked to Bobby

40:35.354 --> 40:36.471
and the agency,

40:36.496 --> 40:40.696
and you are wanted back at work
in Hollyweird Monday morning.

40:41.688 --> 40:43.751
- No, for real?
- For real.

40:43.860 --> 40:45.727
Now, listen, if I call
you on the bat-phone,

40:45.759 --> 40:46.837
you've gotta come running.

40:46.862 --> 40:48.927
Yes, of course! A hundred percent!

40:48.952 --> 40:50.833
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

40:50.917 --> 40:52.134
Okay, that's enough.

- Okay.

- You're the man!

- You're the man!
- I'm the man!

40:57.337 --> 40:58.562

40:59.220 --> 41:00.242
Okay!

Whoa, whoa!

Is this, uh, a week of celebrations?

41:15.478 --> 41:16.978
You going back to the EMTs?

41:17.003 --> 41:19.181
No, it's nice. Just a
normal, everyday date.

41:19.690 --> 41:21.682
Good, you deserve it.

41:22.208 --> 41:23.291
Well, thank you.

41:23.547 --> 41:25.164
You must be feeling good.

41:25.452 --> 41:27.306
About, uh, Vijay getting his job back?

41:27.331 --> 41:28.722
Yeah, and solving the case.

41:29.321 --> 41:32.657
Oh, well, I'm actually, uh,
I'm used to happier endings.

41:33.145 --> 41:34.930
Harley, we put a bad guy away.

41:35.194 --> 41:37.636
Yeah, but a good guy got
caught in the middle.

41:38.115 --> 41:39.699
Yeah, but you cleared his name

41:39.724 --> 41:41.320
and you found out what
happened to his mom,

41:41.344 --> 41:42.629
and you did right by him.

41:46.130 --> 41:47.459
This is gonna be interesting.

41:48.196 --> 41:49.295
You and me.

41:51.098 --> 41:53.465
Well, I like interesting.

41:54.338 --> 41:56.392
We've always been interesting.
