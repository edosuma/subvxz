00:35.660 --> 00:40.789
By the year 2000, we had begun to
overpopulate, pollute and poison our planet...

00:41.207 --> 00:43.167
...faster than we could clean it up.

00:43.376 --> 00:48.047
We ignored the problem for as long as
we could but we were kidding ourselves.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.133
By 2025, we knew we were
in trouble...

00:51.301 --> 00:55.804
...and began to desperately search
for a new home: Mars.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.975
For the last 20 years, we've sent
unmanned probes with algae...

01:00.185 --> 01:03.312
...bioengineered to grow there and
produce oxygen.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.482
We'll build ourselves an atmosphere
we can breathe.

01:06.816 --> 01:11.612
And for 20 years it seemed to work.
It looked like we'd pulled it off, we'd done it.

01:11.821 --> 01:15.616
Then all of a sudden,
oxygen levels started to drop.

01:15.825 --> 01:17.618
We don't know why.

01:33.968 --> 01:37.846
The international community has thrown
all its resources behind us.

01:38.014 --> 01:41.683
It's the greatest undertaking man
has ever attempted.

01:41.851 --> 01:46.021
Our ship, Mars-1, is too massive to
launch from the surface of the planet.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.024
We've shuttled to the high-orbit
space station...

01:49.192 --> 01:52.861
...for a low-gravity launch to begin
our six-month trip:

01:54.447 --> 01:57.699
The first manned mission to Mars.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.994
The hope and survival
of mankind rests on us.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.128
But I know we'll solve the problem.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.383
Because the best scientific minds are
going there to figure out the answer.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.468
And I'm leading the mission.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.388
I'm Bowman, pilot
and mission commander.

02:20.223 --> 02:24.059
Chantilas, chief science officer
and the soul of the crew.

02:25.395 --> 02:29.148
Santen, a hothead,
but a fine copilot.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.278
Gallagher, our mechanical systems
engineer. Maintenance.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.405
Frankly, not my first choice.

02:42.078 --> 02:44.121
The two civilian members
of the team are:

02:44.289 --> 02:49.877
Burchenal, one of the world's leading
bioengineers, his own greatest hero.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.212
Pettengil...

02:52.380 --> 02:56.550
...terraforming expert and last-minute
replacement on the science team.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.595
And packed away in her box, AMEE:

02:59.762 --> 03:02.556
Autonomous Mapping Exploration
and Evasion.

03:02.765 --> 03:05.184
A multi-task robot on loan
from the Marines.

03:05.435 --> 03:08.812
In other words,
our Mars surface navigator.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.356
We're the first travelers
to another planet.

03:11.608 --> 03:13.817
It's another giant leap
for mankind...

03:14.027 --> 03:18.322
...and if we don't figure out what's
wrong on Mars, it could be our last.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.261
Alpha Mach Indicator.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.263
- Clear.
Confirmed.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.725
That concludes the primary systems
checklist, commander.

03:46.935 --> 03:48.435
Thanks, Lucille.
You're welcome.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.062
Gentlemen...

03:50.396 --> 03:51.813
...take over.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.983
- Can't believe we're doing this.
Just follow the routine.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.987
Secondary systems. OHS/RCS.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.114
Clear.
RCS, confirmed.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.284
- Optical alignment sight.
Op sight, rate 19.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.911
Clear.
Confirmed.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.664
How many hits you get on your website
yesterday, Pettengil?

04:08.915 --> 04:11.750
- I got 500,000.
- That's great.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.335
How many did you get?

04:13.753 --> 04:15.754
ATU, 13.6 degrees.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.298
- Eight hundred and thirty-two.
- Ha, ha, ha.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.677
- Were they all from your mother?
- Yeah.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.314
You know, it's strange. It's gone.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.277
Yesterday I could see it.
Today I looked and I couldn't find it.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.613
So what? You think the Earth just
vanished? It's gone forever?

04:41.823 --> 04:44.783
- It's weird not being able to see it.
- Yeah, so it's weird.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.327
You'll get over it, or you won't.

04:49.664 --> 04:52.457
Just something I wasn't expecting,
that's all.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.840
Gallagher, up for a couple of turns
around the campus?

05:06.306 --> 05:09.141
My grandfather taught me
to sail when I was a kid.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.476
Taught me to read the stars.

05:12.312 --> 05:16.315
"Just in case all the GPS satellites
fell out of the sky," he said.

05:17.025 --> 05:19.651
He said, "Any man who puts his life...

05:19.861 --> 05:22.863
...in the hands of a bunch
of batteries is an idiot. "

05:23.656 --> 05:25.449
A real Yankee.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.327
No, he just wouldn't approve something
he couldn't build with his hands.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.872
- He wouldn't have approved of this.
- Going to Mars?

05:32.040 --> 05:35.083
He'd say we were headed for trouble.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.377
Say we didn't try.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.464
We just finished poisoning the Earth...

05:40.673 --> 05:43.216
...and everyone was dead in 100 years.

05:43.426 --> 05:46.178
Then what was the point of any of it?

05:46.387 --> 05:47.971
Art, beauty, all gone.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.766
The Greeks. The Constitution.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.770
We've been dying for freedom, ideas.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.356
None of it meant anything?

05:57.732 --> 06:02.069
And what about religion?
Do we give up on God too?

06:02.570 --> 06:06.239
You didn't just give up being
a scientist one day, did you?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.868
I realized science...

06:10.078 --> 06:13.914
...couldn't answer any of the really
interesting questions.

06:14.123 --> 06:16.249
So I turned to philosophy.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.628
Been searching for God ever since.

06:33.142 --> 06:37.896
Hey. You're talking to a classroom of
second graders from Iowa. At 14:30.

06:38.106 --> 06:39.898
Wait a minute.
It's your turn to do the kiddies.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.652
Oh, no. It is your turn,
and you know it. Besides...

06:43.945 --> 06:47.155
...I outrank you.
I could order you to do it.

06:47.448 --> 06:49.825
Just because they promote faster
in the Navy.

06:50.451 --> 06:54.037
Of course they do. You have to when
you deal with the best people.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.458
14:30, with a smile on your face.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.836
This mean you're pulling rank
for the shower too?

07:01.129 --> 07:02.671
No, not rank.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.799
Gender. Ladies first.

07:19.647 --> 07:22.315
Could you pass me the towel, please?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.572
Sure. Sorry.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.867
Just pretend I'm your sister.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.874
I have two sisters.
They don't look like you.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.377
This only works if we both believe
it doesn't matter.

07:43.296 --> 07:47.382
- So I should pretend you're Burchenal.
- It could matter more than that.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.303
Why don't we practice? You can get
back in the shower naked...

07:51.512 --> 07:55.223
...and come out, and I'll pretend it
doesn't matter.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.481
Why don't you go fix something?

08:03.816 --> 08:05.609
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

08:14.118 --> 08:17.037
MEV systems check confirmed.
- I'll be on the deck with Bowman.

08:17.205 --> 08:19.414
- Yep, sure.
- Five hundred thousand.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.834
- Eight thirty-two. Tighten up. Hee-ta!
- Ha, ha, ha.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.669
Get ready, boys.
Yeah.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.714
I hate him. It's like high school.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.967
There's the jocks and then us.
You watch my back, I'll watch yours.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.928
Do you want to help me with AMEE?

08:33.095 --> 08:35.304
It's time for her prelaunch
diagnostics check.

08:38.226 --> 08:40.769
Hang on. Who are you kidding?
You're a jock.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.020
You did the NASCAR circuit, right?

08:43.188 --> 08:46.900
I was just tuning cars.
Wasn't really jock stuff.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.444
- It's heavy.
- Ears are still ringing.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.114
What powers this thing?

08:53.282 --> 08:54.699
A helium nuclear power cell.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.869
Size of a beer can,
runs her for eight months.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.423
Hey, sweetie.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.260
Sweetie? Is she our navigator
or your girlfriend?

09:13.469 --> 09:15.887
- Been a long flight.
- Certainly has.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.139
It's looking good.
Let's check your TI.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.611
Tighten up!

09:34.323 --> 09:36.825
So the military removed her reflexes?

09:36.993 --> 09:38.952
That should make her your kind of girl.

09:44.292 --> 09:46.001
Gut him like a fish.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.760
Kill him.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.688
That's my kind of girl.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.232
That's real damn funny.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.694
Activity strictly prohibited. Cease.
- She could've hurt me.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.531
They took away her knife,
but inside she's all Green Beret.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.367
Back in navigator mode.
You'll dig Mars.

10:22.538 --> 10:24.122
So have a good time...

10:24.332 --> 10:27.542
...and I hope to see you back
on Earth soon. Good luck.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.127
We miss you.

10:29.754 --> 10:30.879
Bye.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.256
209 web messages remaining.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.591
Hey, Teddy. Remember me?

10:34.759 --> 10:37.093
Sure hope you haven't forgotten
your old friends...

10:37.261 --> 10:39.220
...now that you're a big hotshot
astronaut.

10:39.388 --> 10:41.890
Just wanted to let you know
I'm thinking about you.

10:47.688 --> 10:50.148
I sense an irregular humidity mixture.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.407
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.076
How you doing?

11:01.243 --> 11:04.245
Fine.
Soon as someone explains to me...

11:04.413 --> 11:08.792
...why a flight deck indicator says
the temperature is above normal.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.752
About 10 degrees.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.421
Fahrenheit or centigrade?

11:19.595 --> 11:21.221
He's teaching me about biology.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.307
- I've developed an interest in...
- Fermentation?

11:25.810 --> 11:30.105
A billion dollars in this mission, and
you use the lab equipment as a still?

11:30.314 --> 11:31.940
No. I'm...

11:32.858 --> 11:35.276
- I'm sterilizing.
- Uh-huh.

11:35.778 --> 11:40.198
And how do you propose
that I explain to Houston...

11:45.454 --> 11:49.290
...that two of my crew went blind
drinking moonshine vodka?

11:51.460 --> 11:52.627
Very carefully?

12:01.137 --> 12:04.639
So, what? Doesn't this establishment
serve women?

12:06.475 --> 12:08.143
Allow me.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.480
Commander Bowman.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.486
Whoo!

12:20.072 --> 12:21.990
I learned how to drink
in the Navy, boys.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.998
Chantilas, there were frogs
around when you were a kid, right?

12:30.249 --> 12:31.249
Lots.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.669
And then we killed them.
Every last one.

12:35.004 --> 12:38.965
Now, since frogs breathe
through their skins...

12:39.175 --> 12:43.178
...they react to the toxins
in the environment more rapidly.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.514
That should've been a warning.
Don't you think?

12:48.434 --> 12:49.559
What's your point?

12:50.644 --> 12:54.689
Man's a party animal. If he's doing
okay, then nothing else matters.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.816
That's not gonna change.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.696
Unless there are larger forces
at work than biology.

13:02.615 --> 13:07.702
Uh-oh. We're gonna talk about God now,
aren't we? If we are, I'll need another pop.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.039
Not God, faith.

13:11.207 --> 13:15.376
Faith? I had a girlfriend named Faith.
Cheated on me with a girl named Chastity.

13:18.380 --> 13:23.051
You wouldn't be riding
309 million kilometers...

13:23.219 --> 13:25.303
...into outer space and back...

13:25.471 --> 13:29.432
...in a rocket ship that nobody
ever tested properly...

13:29.600 --> 13:31.726
...without having a little faith.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.692
Listen. Let's forget all the hypotheticals
for a second, okay?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.736
I say...

13:42.154 --> 13:45.031
...to hell with humanity.
I say, Commander Bowman...

13:46.408 --> 13:49.744
...when we get to Mars,
we just take it.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.580
We just take it over for ourselves.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.251
Call Earth, tell them it sucks
and don't bother coming?

13:56.460 --> 13:59.379
Yeah. Whatever keeps out the riffraff.

13:59.588 --> 14:01.089
You can do the religion thing.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.051
Gallagher, you can keep
the space john working, and...

14:05.261 --> 14:07.512
...Pettengil's passed out...

14:07.763 --> 14:11.432
...and I can handle pretty much
everything else, you know.

14:11.934 --> 14:12.976
King.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.061
What about me?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.483
Well, you'll be my queen.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.115
Propagation of the species.

14:39.003 --> 14:40.295
It's just a...

14:41.130 --> 14:45.049
It's just a joke.
Commander Bowman, it was a...

14:46.969 --> 14:51.639
And on that note, gentlemen,
I suggest we retire.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.396
Mars-1, Houston.
You have acquired orbit.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.816
Congratulations on 182 days
of smooth sailing.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.819
And welcome to Mars. Houston out.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.440
Find a good parking space?

15:42.608 --> 15:45.860
Yep. Right between Phobos and Deimos.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.573
I prefer one moon, you know?

15:50.950 --> 15:53.701
That way, you know what to call it.
"The moon. "

15:54.870 --> 15:57.205
More color commentary
from the janitor.

15:57.373 --> 16:01.626
The correct term is
"mechanical systems engineer. "

16:01.877 --> 16:05.213
- But he will accept "space janitor. "
To hell with the chitchat.

16:05.381 --> 16:09.509
After six months, I'm ready to get out
of this hamster cage. Bowman?

16:09.969 --> 16:13.304
Lucille, initiate all pre-launch
systems checks.

16:13.472 --> 16:14.764
Yes, commander.
- Finally.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.392
We're eating dinner on Mars.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.394
Sounds good to me.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.362
Mars entry vehicle launch
in two hours.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.738
HAB 3-D model online.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.907
It'll be nice to live on the ground.

16:33.075 --> 16:36.619
Even if we are exchanging one
hamster cage for another.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.914
If all's gone well, hydroponics
have been online for six months.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.208
We'll have fresh tomatoes tonight.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.335
That's one requirement
for my dream house.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.255
Bet you want
a white picket fence, right?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.798
I wouldn't mind.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.093
- Lucille, can we see our new home?
- Yes, commander.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.392
Locking in on HAB.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.436
LZ 56.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.771
Sure is desolate.

17:06.942 --> 17:10.528
Gamma burst.
Latch up. Free flow.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.696
We'll lose chips. Shut it down!

17:12.906 --> 17:14.866
Now! SEP, some kind
of massive solar flare.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.285
Radiation alert. Level 5 EMP.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.089
Whoa. Radiation alert. Safe area.
Go, guys! Go!

17:34.553 --> 17:36.387
- You too, lieutenant.
- I'm not going anywhere.

17:36.555 --> 17:39.140
- You need me here.
- I want you back there now!

17:41.143 --> 17:42.977
Lieutenant, now. Go.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.937
Massive gamma ray penetration.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.980
The solar flare has passed,
commander.

18:36.323 --> 18:39.617
Power levels are below operating
minimums.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.789
Shit!

18:44.957 --> 18:47.750
Santen?
- Yeah, Bowman, we copy. We're all okay.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.544
What's the damage to the ship?

18:50.254 --> 18:52.964
- We're dead in the water.
Main power unit offline.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.300
She's holding it together now
but could fall apart at any moment.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.220
Auxiliary power unit failure.
Power level still dropping.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.098
Primary systems will shut down
in six minutes.

19:02.266 --> 19:06.269
Change of plans, boys.
We're launching now. Suit up.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.104
I'll secure the ship.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.816
I'm gonna try to get more systems online
and then I'll join you.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.279
Chantilas, suit voice activated.

19:17.406 --> 19:19.740
Gallagher, suit voice activated.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.702
Power level still dropping.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.415
Primary systems will shut down
in five minutes.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.458
Suit computer, online.

19:29.626 --> 19:32.086
Dr. Burchenal,
your EVA systems are 100 percent.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.178
MEV LP lock.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.190
Commence MEV systems check.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.610
AGF online. Apogee kick motor online.

19:55.861 --> 19:58.613
Anti-inertial thrusters initialized.

20:04.453 --> 20:07.246
Auto-launch program online.
I'm arming it now.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.541
Clock de-lock 9K open. IMU online.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.294
DCM flat. AVVI engaged.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.548
- Launch release system not responding.
- That's not good.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.384
- No, it isn't.
- Let's try it another way.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.887
LRS not responding.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.934
- Failure to engage.
- Come on.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.852
Launch release system not responding.

20:30.103 --> 20:33.814
Lieutenant Santen, suit seal
100 percent. Air supply 100 percent.

20:33.982 --> 20:35.358
Ignition systems go.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.361
MEV landing system check.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.743
I'm sorry.
Launch release system not responding.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.871
Okay, guys. Listen up.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.999
The MEV's not supplying power
to the launch release system.

20:52.167 --> 20:54.418
I'm gonna have to stay back
and arm it manually.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.674
Commander, with all due respect,
we're not leaving without you.

21:00.592 --> 21:01.842
It's not up for debate.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.679
Cut auto-guidance
and try to reboot the arm.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.181
No, we don't have time.
Santen...

21:07.349 --> 21:08.516
...you're in charge.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.686
I hope you like the saddle.
Lock it up, gentlemen.

21:11.895 --> 21:14.981
Santen, MEV launch systems
ready. Launch on your command.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.275
- Crew secure?
- Secure.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.694
- Secure.
- Secure.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.697
Secure.

21:22.906 --> 21:26.200
The MEV guidance system
is scanning for the HAB transponder.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.994
MEV launch sequence initiated.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.537
We're green across the board.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.957
Boosters online. Fueling D tanks.

21:34.042 --> 21:35.293
God, I hope she makes it.

21:36.795 --> 21:40.923
Commander, primary
system shutdown in 50 seconds.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.472
Launch.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.337
Auto-guidance out.
Flare must've cooked a chip.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.005
I thought MEV was shielded.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.091
Complain later.
I'm going to manual flight.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.985
Commander, five seconds.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.366
Primary system shutdown.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.249
Artificial gravity failure.

22:57.667 --> 22:58.751
Oh, shit.

22:58.960 --> 23:01.629
We have an electrical fire
in access tube four.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.382
Smoke warning in sphere six.

23:16.561 --> 23:19.814
The solar radiation damaged
the auto fire extinguishers.

23:24.319 --> 23:26.153
- Caution, commander.
- Later, Lucille.

23:35.539 --> 23:38.833
This is a zero-gravity fire,
commander. I tried warning you.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.670
Deploying chutes.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.845
Smoke warning in sphere six.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.680
Brace yourself this time.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.313
Commander, we have additional fires
in spheres three and five.

24:04.693 --> 24:06.485
We're off-target. Terrain's crappy.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.155
- I'm dumping the landing gear.
AMEE's in there.

24:09.322 --> 24:10.322
No choice.

24:26.381 --> 24:29.633
We now have fire in spheres three,
seven and eight.

24:34.556 --> 24:35.806
I'm deploying bags.

24:43.482 --> 24:46.859
Biosystems indicate increasing air
toxicity.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.494
Here comes your 19th
Nervous breakdown

25:42.624 --> 25:43.624
Chantilas!

26:16.449 --> 26:18.784
Flames now consume 80 percent
of the ship.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.788
This exceeds our fire-extinguishing
capacity.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.143
All fires are extinguished.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.395
O-2 levels 0 percent.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.868
Okay, okay.

28:25.745 --> 28:28.455
Take him easy. Here. Good.

28:29.249 --> 28:30.416
Help him up.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.543
Here, sit down for a minute.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.919
Nice and easy.

28:36.339 --> 28:37.589
There you go.

28:40.927 --> 28:45.097
Init, terra, Mars, alpha.
Compiling mission itinerary.

28:45.306 --> 28:47.474
You don't appear to have
any compound fractures.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.310
Doesn't look like you broke anything.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.318
Reserve power supplies are failing.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.821
Auxiliary power unit, 20 percent.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.158
Reroute the main power supply
through the B-chip, Lucille.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.327
This violates operating parameters,
commander.

29:07.495 --> 29:10.664
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.
You got that?

29:10.957 --> 29:12.416
Do it. Now.

29:12.792 --> 29:18.922
Yes, commander. Alpha processor
discharged. Power sent to beta chip.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.593
Main power unit 15 percent.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.183
Main power unit restored.
Well done, commander.

29:42.405 --> 29:46.033
- Artificial gravity restored.
- No shit.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.329
Artificial atmosphere systems restored.

29:50.538 --> 29:52.831
O-2 level 2 percent and increasing.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.125
Where the hell is HAB?

29:55.293 --> 29:57.461
If you hadn't dumped
our navigator, we'd know.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.380
Can't get a visual on AMEE,
but maybe I can fix this radio.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.840
How long?

30:02.008 --> 30:04.176
I don't know.
These repairs'll take a while.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.428
Science package is KO'd also.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.974
- Shit. There goes the mission.
- Mission's not over yet, Pettengil.

30:11.226 --> 30:14.353
Really? Did you miss something?
We lost the science package.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.939
- We can't do what we came here for.
- Quit whining.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.234
You did park us on the rocks.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.236
And you knew there were risks.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.864
Right now, gentlemen, locating HAB
is what matters.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.575
Exterior atmosphere indicator
is disabled.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.704
- I think we're somewhere downrange.
- Calculating landing ellipse.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.873
Based on our last uncorrupted nav
state...

30:35.041 --> 30:38.210
...I'd say we're somewhere
in this 60 by 120 kilometer ellipse.

30:38.670 --> 30:43.507
The mission data's here. We need to
close in on the downrange variables.

30:43.716 --> 30:44.967
It's about the math.

30:45.677 --> 30:48.470
This is it. That moment they told us
about in high school...

30:48.680 --> 30:51.098
...where one day, algebra would
save our lives.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.308
Shut up.

30:53.476 --> 30:54.852
Sorry.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.397
Warning, AMEE not responding.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.316
Mars-1 comm initiation unsuccessful.

31:05.488 --> 31:06.780
T- ray imaging.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.008
Oh, man.

31:30.805 --> 31:33.765
System memory, bring up a panoramic
shot from the HAB.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.434
Ocular mach 1-X panoramic mode.

31:35.643 --> 31:38.604
- Reverse?
- Downrange charging.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.942
Hey, guys. Look at this.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.485
What, Gallagher?

31:45.653 --> 31:49.072
I don't think it's about the math.
I think it's about the picture.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.407
What picture?

31:50.575 --> 31:51.783
This one.

31:51.951 --> 31:56.079
We're not in that picture.
If we were, we'd know where HAB was.

31:56.289 --> 32:01.335
I know, but if this rock is HAB and
it's in the line about 30 degrees...

32:01.544 --> 32:04.755
...it sees these two peaks, but
reverse, as it's on the other side...

32:04.964 --> 32:07.382
...and at 180 degrees,
it sees those two peaks.

32:07.592 --> 32:10.010
Which puts us on a line about here...

32:10.637 --> 32:13.347
...which makes the line to the HAB
about there.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.767
He's right.

32:18.478 --> 32:20.145
Nice work, space janitor.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.482
We only have seven
and a half hours of air left.

32:24.484 --> 32:25.817
Let's get moving.

32:53.429 --> 32:55.389
I realized science...

32:55.598 --> 32:59.393
...couldn't answer any of the really
interesting questions.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.728
So I turned to philosophy.

33:02.563 --> 33:05.023
Been searching for God ever since.

33:05.441 --> 33:06.817
Who knows?

33:07.068 --> 33:10.445
I may pick up a rock and it'll say
underneath, "Made by God. "

33:10.697 --> 33:13.532
Universe is full of surprises.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.867
That would be a big one.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.249
You ready, sir?

33:24.961 --> 33:27.546
Unfortunately, I'm staying here.

33:27.714 --> 33:28.880
What?

33:29.382 --> 33:32.884
My spleen's ruptured.
There's significant internal bleeding.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.553
I wouldn't get very far.

33:34.762 --> 33:38.557
We have emergency medical gear at HAB.
We can lock out the spine impulse.

33:38.891 --> 33:40.934
You can walk us through the surgery.

33:41.185 --> 33:45.522
Carrying me will slow you all down,
enough to deplete everyone's oxygen.

33:45.732 --> 33:48.525
This is no time for misguided heroics.

33:48.735 --> 33:49.985
I won't let you die here.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.447
What we came here to do
is more important.

33:54.365 --> 33:57.159
The four of you must carry on
with the mission.

33:57.618 --> 34:00.620
It won't be easy,
but I know you can do it.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.166
Get going.

34:09.338 --> 34:10.922
You heard the man.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.647
Hey...

34:28.315 --> 34:30.275
...I got to see Mars.

35:12.151 --> 35:14.528
Come on, give me a red light.
Give me juice.

35:14.737 --> 35:19.658
Come on, don't do this to me and
my team. Give me a goddamn red light.

35:19.909 --> 35:22.077
Communications online.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.454
See? All you needed
was an attitude check.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.081
Thank you, commander.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.627
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.
Can you hear me? Over.

35:33.506 --> 35:36.967
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.
Do you copy? Over.

35:41.222 --> 35:44.141
Terrascan has nothing to report.
No life form trace apparent.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.726
It's weird. There's nothing here.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.645
It's Mars.

35:49.188 --> 35:52.357
No, I mean there's not one sign
of the algae we sent up here.

35:52.567 --> 35:56.570
Even if it all died, there should be
something. Dried algal mat, traces...

35:56.737 --> 35:58.905
He's right. They're not
just dead, they're gone.

35:59.073 --> 36:03.243
Like they were scoured off. This says
there was nothing ever here. Impossible.

36:03.786 --> 36:06.413
Maybe there was never anything
in this valley.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.624
If we are where we think we are...

36:09.834 --> 36:12.878
...this area was covered
with blue algae just a month ago.

36:13.504 --> 36:17.007
The valley before this should've been
blazing with red-orange chloroflectic.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.342
All this talking's burning up oxygen.
Move out.

36:19.510 --> 36:22.304
We know what happened to the oxygen.
Nothing here to make it.

36:22.513 --> 36:24.222
You done?

36:24.390 --> 36:26.266
I said, move out.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.641
Ten minutes until we exit the day side.

37:07.892 --> 37:10.018
Okay, where are the boys?

37:10.603 --> 37:11.937
Grid tracking. De-lock.

37:16.150 --> 37:17.943
- Boys, where are you?
- LZ topography.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.946
Six degrees tracking,
three minutes tracking.

37:21.197 --> 37:22.530
LT lock.

37:23.199 --> 37:24.991
MEV landing zone. LZ 56.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.118
Why aren't you at the LZ?

37:52.186 --> 37:55.689
Five minutes until we exit
the day side and lose visuals.

37:55.898 --> 37:57.691
1-4-4-X.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.651
Azimuth HZ 4.99.

37:59.860 --> 38:01.236
Boys, where are you?

38:01.445 --> 38:03.196
MEV LP lock.

38:06.826 --> 38:07.951
Oh, shit.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.871
Find HAB for me, Lucille.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.261
There it is!

38:26.429 --> 38:29.764
- We made it.
- Twenty-six months of food, air and water.

38:29.932 --> 38:32.392
We made it!
- Food! Whoo!

39:05.801 --> 39:07.552
God help us.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.651
It's all chewed up.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.490
What happened?

39:29.367 --> 39:32.619
- Ice storm couldn't have done this.
- No way.

39:32.870 --> 39:36.206
Every HAB stood up to an F-5
in tornado alley.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.041
This isn't weather-related.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.085
Okay. What are we gonna do?

39:41.003 --> 39:42.921
Start looking for O-2.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.137
Houston, this is Mars-1.

39:51.347 --> 39:55.767
We've experienced a massive proton
field upset sequel to a solar flare.

39:56.560 --> 40:01.439
Mars-1 systems at below 70 percent, orbital
path degraded by fire-control air purge.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.400
Engine function zero.

40:12.618 --> 40:15.829
MEV launched with a crew of five.
I have visual on crash site.

40:16.080 --> 40:20.208
I can see one person down. I have
absolutely no radio contact with them.

40:20.418 --> 40:24.129
Houston, visuals confirm that HAB-1
is tango-uniform.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.631
I repeat, HAB-1 has been destroyed.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.768
Even if the rest of the team is alive,
they have no way to survive.

40:39.937 --> 40:43.773
I'm uploading telemetry
and video data to you now.

40:47.528 --> 40:49.487
Data unit relay.

40:58.038 --> 40:59.205
I don't see anything.

40:59.748 --> 41:02.167
No food, no air, no water.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.504
What are we gonna do?
Nothing we can do.

41:06.672 --> 41:08.131
We're out of time.

41:08.340 --> 41:10.216
We're out of time
when we're out of air.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.302
Sixteen minutes. What do you got left?

41:12.470 --> 41:13.845
A little less.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.515
Some final entry for the bio.

41:18.267 --> 41:22.979
"Disappointed 12 billion people,
not counting the ex-wives. "

41:46.003 --> 41:47.420
Ugh!

42:03.395 --> 42:05.396
I hope Bowman made it.

42:08.776 --> 42:12.153
You know, I had a thing for her...

42:13.572 --> 42:15.198
...from the start.

42:15.407 --> 42:19.369
I thought they chose me
because I was single...

42:20.162 --> 42:21.871
...in case I died.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.212
Short time to live.

42:31.590 --> 42:34.008
Long time to wait.

42:45.437 --> 42:47.814
God, it really is beautiful, isn't it?

42:55.990 --> 42:59.117
I was planning on getting engaged
when I got back.

43:01.954 --> 43:04.664
Yeah, well, I'm gonna miss
a lot of girls.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.584
A lot of girls are gonna miss me.

43:10.754 --> 43:13.006
I was never supposed to be here.

43:13.549 --> 43:16.342
I was just the next lucky guy
on the list.

43:18.220 --> 43:21.306
Well, my flying ability
isn't an issue now.

43:21.849 --> 43:25.018
With HAB destroyed, it makes no
difference where we landed.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.603
You're calculating excuses.

43:26.770 --> 43:31.149
Nothing to excuse.
It's moot. No impact.

43:32.401 --> 43:34.861
- But Chantilas?
- Moot.

43:35.946 --> 43:38.114
He'd have died here anyway.

43:38.949 --> 43:40.617
Just like us.

43:43.329 --> 43:45.663
You're amazing, Mr. Santen.

43:45.831 --> 43:49.417
Your life is about to end,
and you still can't accept defeat.

43:50.002 --> 43:54.797
I can come across as a hard-ass.
I know that. But technically...

43:55.466 --> 43:57.300
...I didn't fail.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.264
Look, what's done is done.

44:05.976 --> 44:09.562
- I came up here to forgive you.
- Yeah? Well, screw you.

44:09.772 --> 44:13.024
I don't need forgiveness
from a pussy like you.

44:17.237 --> 44:18.863
Get out of here.

44:21.283 --> 44:24.410
Go away and die like a man if you can.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.958
Santen. Oh, my God. Santen!

44:39.927 --> 44:41.719
Oh, Jesus.

44:44.515 --> 44:49.227
Mars' polar ice is mostly CO-2.

44:49.603 --> 44:54.732
We use low-order nuclear detonations
to melt the ice.

44:55.943 --> 44:57.318
That releases CO-2.

44:58.112 --> 45:02.657
CO-2 buildup creates a greenhouse
effect.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.618
Mars starts to warm up.

45:06.036 --> 45:07.995
Now, when it's hot enough...

45:08.247 --> 45:11.624
...we seed down some algae.

45:12.084 --> 45:16.421
The algae grows and emits oxygen.

45:23.679 --> 45:27.390
You want me to just shut up
and let you die quietly?

45:27.558 --> 45:31.227
No. Kind of peaceful.

45:32.354 --> 45:36.524
Okay. So they sent us here...

45:36.734 --> 45:41.779
...to figure out what happened
to the oxygen.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.781
Question is...

45:45.075 --> 45:47.618
...what happened to the algae?

45:48.620 --> 45:49.704
You know?

45:59.423 --> 46:01.048
Santen's dead.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.718
He threw himself off a cliff.

46:06.054 --> 46:07.764
I tried to stop him.

46:18.525 --> 46:21.360
Gallagher,
replace your O-2 canister immediately.

46:21.570 --> 46:23.196
I'm under a minute.

46:25.741 --> 46:27.533
What's it gonna be like?

46:29.203 --> 46:30.745
Hypoxia?

46:32.456 --> 46:35.583
Dizziness. Skin will tingle.

46:36.251 --> 46:38.002
Vision narrows.

46:38.170 --> 46:40.338
Then shock, convulsions...

46:41.048 --> 46:42.673
...acidosis...

46:43.675 --> 46:45.426
Is it gonna hurt?

46:47.387 --> 46:49.013
Yeah.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.645
I'm going to... I'm going to...

46:55.896 --> 46:57.897
...go over here. Take a walk.

47:00.275 --> 47:02.360
Gallagher, oxygen supply depleted.

47:09.493 --> 47:12.703
Gallagher.
- I was... Ugh! Ugh!

47:40.065 --> 47:44.652
Burchenal,
replace your O-2 canister immediately.

48:07.926 --> 48:11.304
Pettengil, replace your
O-2 canister immediately.

48:29.114 --> 48:32.283
I can breathe.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.623
It's like being in high altitude.

48:38.832 --> 48:41.918
I don't know how we can breathe,
but we can breathe.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.010
We can breathe!

48:53.847 --> 48:55.973
I don't know what the hell this is.

48:56.683 --> 48:58.225
But I'll take it.

49:07.402 --> 49:08.736
I can breathe.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.117
This can't be possible.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.288
What the hell is going on here?

49:20.707 --> 49:23.542
If Santen waited a few more
minutes...

49:23.752 --> 49:26.003
We can breathe, Santen.

49:26.171 --> 49:27.797
We can breathe.

49:32.886 --> 49:35.471
Attention, commander, incoming relay.

49:35.681 --> 49:39.558
Mars-1, this is Houston. We
got your message. Glad to hear your voice.

49:39.851 --> 49:41.894
Analysis of your telemetry...

49:42.104 --> 49:45.022
...indicates Mars-1 orbital failure
in 31 hours.

49:45.190 --> 49:47.733
The good news is, we'll have you
out of there by then.

49:47.901 --> 49:51.070
We believe we can restore engine
function for a main engine burn...

49:51.238 --> 49:53.531
...and exit from Mars' orbit.

49:53.699 --> 49:57.660
Ground crew is presumed
end of mission. Houston out.

50:01.415 --> 50:06.335
Terraforming didn't even come close
to creating breathable air up here.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.713
- Right?
- Right.

50:08.880 --> 50:11.924
The oxygen levels were already
dropping when all the sensors died.

50:12.092 --> 50:15.136
So how can there be more O-2
now than ever before...

50:16.096 --> 50:19.265
...and no algae to make it? Huh?

50:23.979 --> 50:27.857
Sorry, commander.
No response from ignition systems.

50:34.406 --> 50:36.365
Houston, Mars-1.

50:36.616 --> 50:39.035
No joy on all scenarios
for engine ignition.

50:39.244 --> 50:43.289
That includes hitting the console.
What next? Over.

50:43.498 --> 50:47.376
God, I wish I didn't have to wait
40 minutes to hear your answer.

50:48.336 --> 50:50.921
Hey, guys. Here's the radio.

50:52.507 --> 50:54.717
We're not going to be calling Bowman
on this.

50:56.762 --> 50:58.012
Wait a second.

50:58.555 --> 51:02.266
I saw something when we were trying
to locate HAB.

51:03.185 --> 51:05.895
That little rover they sent up here
back in '97.

51:06.104 --> 51:07.938
That must have a radio, right?

51:08.148 --> 51:09.732
- Yeah.
- Hang on.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.443
It's 4 kilometers from here.

51:14.279 --> 51:16.072
Gonna get dark real soon.

51:16.239 --> 51:18.032
It'll be too cold.

51:18.200 --> 51:19.950
We'll go first light.

51:21.995 --> 51:24.997
At least this thing still has
enough rocket fuel to keep us warm.

51:25.165 --> 51:27.625
Here comes a billion-dollar campfire.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.921
At least it's good for something.

51:37.636 --> 51:38.677
Ha.

51:55.779 --> 51:58.114
If the radio at the rover works...

51:59.241 --> 52:00.699
...we can contact Bowman...

52:02.410 --> 52:04.912
...tell her there's breathable air here.

52:08.208 --> 52:10.376
But that isn't gonna help us, is it?

52:12.629 --> 52:14.338
Hey, Pettengil.

52:14.506 --> 52:17.550
Must have been hard watching
Santen go like that, huh?

52:20.804 --> 52:22.346
Yes, it was.

52:25.183 --> 52:26.559
I bet.

52:38.405 --> 52:40.156
It's your girlfriend. She made it.

52:40.365 --> 52:43.117
Hey, AMEE. I thought you were dead.

52:43.285 --> 52:45.786
Hi, sweetie. Good to see you.

52:45.996 --> 52:48.205
You're kind of banged up.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.082
Knew you'd make it.

52:50.625 --> 52:54.461
Hey, are you a little out of whack?
Flip over for me.

53:04.806 --> 53:06.849
Shoot. The processor's damaged.

53:07.058 --> 53:10.186
- Can she still navigate for us?
- Yeah, till she breaks down for good.

53:10.395 --> 53:12.479
We wait till she breaks down,
the drone'll crash.

53:12.772 --> 53:15.024
Let's yank her Mars positioning
system now.

53:15.233 --> 53:18.277
MPS hard drive's modular.
It's self-powered.

53:18.486 --> 53:21.780
We can run it through an HHC. That
would give us control of the drone...

53:21.990 --> 53:24.909
...but then, that'd be killing her.

53:25.327 --> 53:27.745
Yeah? You want me to do it?

53:28.622 --> 53:30.331
No, I'll do it.

53:41.593 --> 53:43.510
AMEE!

53:50.143 --> 53:51.810
AMEE.

53:56.775 --> 53:57.816
Shit.

54:00.779 --> 54:01.820
Ah!

54:13.917 --> 54:15.793
AMEE, no.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.419
No.

54:25.929 --> 54:26.929
Ah!

54:37.274 --> 54:38.440
AMEE.

54:43.530 --> 54:44.863
Gallagher, what's going on?

54:45.073 --> 54:47.574
She's in military mode.
Crash must've flipped her.

54:47.784 --> 54:51.078
Why did she turn on us?
- We tried to kill her.

54:52.580 --> 54:54.331
- Made us the enemy.
Son of a bitch.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.292
- You okay?
Then override her.

54:56.459 --> 54:58.377
I tried. She won't respond.

55:03.591 --> 55:04.842
It's a broken rib.

55:05.760 --> 55:09.221
Tell me something I don't know,
like why she let us live. She had us.

55:09.389 --> 55:11.932
She's playing war games.
Guerilla tactics.

55:12.142 --> 55:14.601
It's an old trick.
Wound one of the enemy.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.937
The others have to help out.
Slows them down.

55:20.358 --> 55:23.485
Sooner or later,
she'll play search and destroy.

55:24.404 --> 55:26.071
Then she'll come and kill us.

55:26.239 --> 55:27.573
One by one.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.659
You all right?

55:54.392 --> 55:57.644
AMEE jammed the transmitters
so we won't know where she is.

56:08.865 --> 56:10.115
You all right?

56:13.953 --> 56:16.121
Only hurts when I breathe.

56:20.418 --> 56:22.294
Sun's gonna come up soon.

56:23.755 --> 56:26.882
Might as well get going.
Give me a hand?

56:54.327 --> 56:55.369
Whoa.

56:56.746 --> 57:00.290
Sure get some high arc
in this low gravity, huh?

57:04.587 --> 57:07.714
Watching this, AMEE?
Taking the first piss on Mars.

57:17.183 --> 57:18.851
Boosters online.

57:25.358 --> 57:27.234
AMI confirmed.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.924
Ignition system operable.
Awaiting burn instructions.

57:51.134 --> 57:53.510
Houston, I have a green light
for engine ignition.

57:53.678 --> 57:56.305
I repeat,
I'm a go for engine ignition.

57:57.974 --> 57:59.475
Thank you, guys.

57:59.976 --> 58:02.144
Thank you for busting your asses.

58:06.524 --> 58:08.817
I have some time
before I have to punch.

58:09.027 --> 58:11.403
I'll take another look
for the crew at daybreak.

58:11.863 --> 58:14.781
I know they're end of mission,
but it's something I gotta do.

58:14.991 --> 58:16.241
Over.

58:16.659 --> 58:17.910
Relayed.

58:21.247 --> 58:23.290
You know what you're doing, right?

58:23.458 --> 58:24.875
I always know what I'm doing.

58:38.681 --> 58:39.848
Charming.

58:40.016 --> 58:42.643
It's a 50-year-old off-the-shelf
computer modem...

58:42.810 --> 58:45.979
...on a frequency we're not using
on our mission...

58:46.147 --> 58:48.190
...but it beats shouting for help.

58:54.906 --> 58:56.490
I got it.

59:07.502 --> 59:12.506
Synchronous lock. L-2.3.
Seek lock off.

59:12.924 --> 59:14.925
1-4-4-X.

59:16.010 --> 59:17.678
HZ lock.

59:24.811 --> 59:27.062
Houston, Mars-1.

59:27.230 --> 59:30.357
I'm configuring Mars-1 for a final
slingshot around the day side.

59:30.525 --> 59:33.026
And I will be returning to Earth.

59:33.653 --> 59:34.820
Relayed.

59:39.742 --> 59:41.118
Let's do it.

59:57.343 --> 59:58.594
Test, test.

59:59.012 --> 01:00:00.178
Does it work?

01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:02.431
I don't know.
The little green light's on.

01:00:03.141 --> 01:00:06.893
Houston, Mars-1.
I've acquired elliptical orbit.

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:11.231
I'm commencing engine ignition
sequence for Earth return.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:19.865
This is Mars-1 ground crew.
Do you copy?

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.867
This is Mars-1 ground crew.

01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:24.620
Do you copy? Hello?

01:00:24.912 --> 01:00:26.580
We're the guys on Mars.

01:00:27.582 --> 01:00:28.957
Come on. Someone talk to us.

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.584
Let's try it again.

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:33.545
This is Mars-1 ground crew.
Do you copy?

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:36.882
This is Mars-1 ground crew.
Do you copy?

01:00:37.050 --> 01:00:39.885
Maybe they'll hear us back in 1997.

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.435
It's been two hours.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:51.897
Mars-1, Houston.

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:54.399
Mars-1, Houston.

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:58.320
We've picked something off a radio
telescope pointed in your direction.

01:00:58.529 --> 01:00:59.696
You won't believe this.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:03.659
You'll have to tune to a frequency
we haven't used in 50 years.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.327
Yeah, well...

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.788
...it was worth a shot.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.677
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.
Do you copy?

01:01:22.845 --> 01:01:24.846
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.

01:01:25.056 --> 01:01:27.182
Bowman! Bowman!

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.517
Gallagher?

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.271
You're alive.

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:34.856
Yeah.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.442
Holy shit, you made it too.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:40.946
I know that HAB is wrecked.
What is your status?

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.699
We're down here at the little rover,
what's-its-name...

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:46.076
...with Burchenal and Pettengil.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:49.037
Got no food and water,
AMEE's gone mustang...

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.832
...and, oh, yeah, we can breathe.

01:01:53.835 --> 01:01:57.838
How can that be? The oxygen levels are...
That is impossible.

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.298
I don't know.
But we're doing it.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.176
I saw a body back at MEV.
Who was it?

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:06.972
That was Chantilas.
Santen's gone too.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.306
What happened?

01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:10.851
Pettengil says he threw himself
off a cliff.

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:13.603
Anyway, that's the news.

01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:16.648
We're not gonna make it much longer.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:20.318
I hope you got an idea,
because we're fresh out.

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:24.156
Okay, well, let me work on it.
I'll get back to you.

01:02:25.074 --> 01:02:27.576
I hope she has a magic wand.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:33.915
Houston, we have three men alive
and breathing on Mars.

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:37.085
Let's bring them home.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.464
You just can't get around it, can you?

01:02:40.631 --> 01:02:44.509
I still can't figure out this algae
and oxygen business.

01:02:44.677 --> 01:02:46.386
You hate not knowing, don't you?

01:02:46.679 --> 01:02:50.849
- Given time, believe me, I'll know.
- Yeah, maybe.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:55.228
Maybe life's just more mysterious
than you think it is.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.025
You know, you spent too much time
with Chantilas.

01:03:00.193 --> 01:03:02.527
But if you want
to take the God route...

01:03:02.737 --> 01:03:05.155
...the easy way, that's up to you.

01:03:05.406 --> 01:03:07.949
Easy way? There's nothing easy
about a spiritual life.

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:12.037
It's a lot more difficult
than just being intelligent.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.040
I think you're just ignoring the facts.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:18.794
Facts. I bet you were no fun
at Christmas.

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:21.880
I bet your mom told you there's
no tooth fairy when you were 4.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:24.549
I'm a geneticist. I write code.
Okay?

01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:27.844
A, G, T, P in different combinations.

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:30.222
Hacking the human genome. Okay?

01:03:30.556 --> 01:03:32.349
I choose what, I choose where...

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:36.895
...and either your kidneys work or
you grow a sixth finger. I do that!

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.773
Now, you spot God...

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.610
...you let me know.
Until then, I'll trust my Ph. Ds.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:56.665
It might sound crazy,
but it's the only choice you got.

01:03:56.874 --> 01:03:59.960
We walk 100 kilometers to a 30-year-old
Russian rock probe...

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:03.004
...that failed to launch and try
to jump-start it.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.258
Gee, why couldn't you make it tough?

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:11.596
The probe's called Cosmos. Houston
found the designer, name's Borokovski.

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:13.807
Owns a deli in Brooklyn.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:17.602
He thinks you can start the launch
sequence right there on site.

01:04:17.770 --> 01:04:21.231
Former rocket scientist
who now specializes in...

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:24.693
...making sandwiches. Terrific.

01:04:24.902 --> 01:04:26.444
Here's the hard part:

01:04:26.612 --> 01:04:29.698
You got just under 19 hours to get
there and get it off the ground.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:33.159
Then I take back what I said
about it being tough.

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:37.747
I gotta ditch the B tank and burn
more fuel from A to hold orbit that long.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:42.127
I can't burn much after that or Mars-1
won't have enough fuel to get home.

01:04:42.336 --> 01:04:44.296
I need a heading.
Which way should I go?

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:50.010
Okay, you want to go
to your 5:00.

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:55.015
- There you go.
Okay, we're set.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:58.310
I got some work to do, then I'll be
in blackout on the dark side.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:05:00.061
So I'll call you when I get back.

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:02.856
Roger. Thanks.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.357
Sorry it's not more.

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:06.067
Hey, it's something.

01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:07.903
Give me a hand.

01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.363
It's nice just to know
you're still up there.

01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:13.366
Well, I don't mind dying.
I just hate being alone...

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:16.494
...so get your asses back here.
Talk to you later.

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:20.498
Thanks. My rib feels
like it's through my lung.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.334
Gallagher, what do you think?

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:27.172
I think it's very distracting
seeing you get out of the shower.

01:05:27.381 --> 01:05:29.883
I started to lock the door after that.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.551
No, you didn't.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:33.845
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:51.780
Good night.

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:30.527
What's that?

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:32.737
Over there.

01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:35.740
Looks like the ground's moving.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.534
I didn't see anything.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:43.957
It's gone now,
but I definitely saw something.

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:55.427
Gallagher?

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:58.596
Hey, Bowman. How you doing?
Need a headings check.

01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:01.599
You're right on target.
Listen, I need to talk to you.

01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:07.272
Took the comm off. What's the matter?

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:08.565
Bowman?

01:07:10.067 --> 01:07:14.279
The only place to ride the Cosmos is
in the rock sample container.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.281
Sounds comfy.

01:07:16.615 --> 01:07:18.283
It's very small.

01:07:19.118 --> 01:07:21.077
Borokovski and Houston...

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:25.790
...have been trying to figure out how
to cram three people in...

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.210
...and it only fits two people.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.421
Two people, barely.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.507
How we doing?

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.092
Good. Great.

01:07:37.303 --> 01:07:38.678
I'm sorry.

01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:43.808
Yeah, right. I'll talk to you later.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:55.904
Let's patch you up.
It'll help with the pain.

01:07:59.241 --> 01:08:02.952
I can barely breathe.
This air's too damn thin!

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:05.330
You're gonna be okay.

01:08:06.957 --> 01:08:08.208
Put your arm over.

01:08:08.417 --> 01:08:10.752
That's right. Left foot.

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:12.837
Right foot. That's right.

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.173
Hop like a bunny. Just go.

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:19.719
Here it comes, here it comes

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:22.971
Here comes your 19th
nervous breakdown

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.515
What are you doing?

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:27.685
It's a song my grandfather sang.
The Rolling Stones.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:29.020
Come on, sing it.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:32.107
Here it comes

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:36.069
Here comes your 19th
nervous breakdown

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.765
Commander.
A massive low-pressure system...

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:08.560
...is approaching the crew.

01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:12.147
Atmospheric pressure 820 millibars.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:15.942
Gentlemen, a big ice storm's
coming straight for you.

01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:18.987
It's the size of Montana,
and it's moving fast.

01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:21.156
I'm going into comm blackout.

01:09:21.407 --> 01:09:23.992
You need to find shelter immediately.
Now.

01:09:27.705 --> 01:09:29.831
Where are we gonna
find shelter around here?

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.710
Over here! There's an opening!

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:39.883
Maximum sustained winds:
111 miles per hour.

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:43.011
Temperature:
Negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:52.645
Hurry.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:03.990
Shit!

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.034
Houston, this is Mars-1.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:32.268
How far is Cosmos from here?

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:35.355
What?

01:10:35.981 --> 01:10:37.398
Cosmos.

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:40.401
How far you think it is?

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:42.487
Five or six hours.

01:10:43.113 --> 01:10:44.614
Say five.

01:10:45.741 --> 01:10:48.701
That leaves us four hours
to try and launch...

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:52.372
...not counting whatever time
we lose here.

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:55.917
This Borokovski better have
a good memory.

01:10:57.878 --> 01:11:00.004
Won't be time for plan B.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:40.920
Only two of us can go on Cosmos.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:45.675
What?

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:49.470
There's only room on Cosmos
for two people.

01:11:52.141 --> 01:11:54.058
You two will both go.

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:57.395
You carry on with the mission.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.898
Tell people what they need to know,
about what you learned here.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:04.736
When we get to Cosmos
I'll help you rig it, and then...

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:07.155
...we'll say goodbye.

01:12:14.246 --> 01:12:18.082
Heh. Probably won't even launch.
It is Russian, after all.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:21.961
Ten feet off the ground, it'll explode.
I'll live longer than both of you.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.262
You're a rare man, Gallagher.

01:12:33.932 --> 01:12:36.434
But somehow I don't quite believe it.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:38.436
What are you talking about?

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:42.982
He thinks I'm responsible
for Santen's death.

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:47.153
What do you think, Gallagher?

01:12:47.946 --> 01:12:49.739
Gallagher?

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.699
You trust me?

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.287
Do you?

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:00.541
I'll watch your back, you watch mine?

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.922
Shit, I know I don't trust you.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:17.016
But you're going to leave
your buddy here behind...

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:19.227
...and take off with me?

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.147
Yes, that's...

01:13:24.024 --> 01:13:26.025
That's what he's gonna do.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.495
Mars-1, this is Houston.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:41.707
We don't know about your clock,
but ours is running out of time.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:44.794
Your team's been out of contact
over three hours.

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:47.463
They did a great job getting
this far...

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:50.550
...but that's a killer storm
no one can survive.

01:13:50.801 --> 01:13:52.343
So here's where we are:

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.430
If you haven't heard from your crew
by the time you receive this...

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.723
...you're ordered to return home.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:13:59.976
Houston out.

01:14:02.729 --> 01:14:04.605
Gallagher, come in.

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:08.818
Gallagher, can you hear me, please?

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:23.624
Shit.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.210
Burchenal.

01:14:26.378 --> 01:14:27.753
- He's gone.
- What?

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:29.630
He took the radio.

01:14:30.632 --> 01:14:33.259
Aw, shit. Shit!

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.393
It's AMEE.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.271
She wants us to watch.

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:38.616
She's got him.

01:15:49.169 --> 01:15:53.506
He was afraid we were gonna
leave him here. He made it come true.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.511
We gotta get that radio
or we're both dead too.

01:16:03.684 --> 01:16:05.017
We lost three hours.

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.853
At least Pettengil's heading
in the right direction.

01:16:08.063 --> 01:16:12.525
- How do you know?
- I took a heading before the storm.

01:16:13.318 --> 01:16:15.069
And lined it up with the stars.

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.696
We're okay.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:31.836
Hey.

01:16:38.176 --> 01:16:39.343
Hold on.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:49.854
This is algae.

01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:52.440
There's algae here.

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.277
Why is it here and nowhere else?

01:17:02.242 --> 01:17:03.951
No time for that now.

01:17:04.536 --> 01:17:05.703
There's Pettengil.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.976
At least he didn't drop
the goddamn radio.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:33.898
AMEE really tore him up.

01:17:39.696 --> 01:17:40.988
Ugh.

01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:47.119
Little shit's got a death grip on it.
Give me the radio.

01:17:50.707 --> 01:17:52.249
I'll call Bowman.

01:17:52.668 --> 01:17:54.543
Why'd he close his visor?

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:56.837
He didn't have any air left.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.440
Bowman, it's Gallagher. You up there?

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:19.777
Bowman, it's Gallagher.

01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:26.742
Must still be on the dark side.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.543
Argh!

01:18:36.294 --> 01:18:37.753
Jesus!

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.724
Some kind of nematode.

01:18:49.975 --> 01:18:51.851
The sparks ignited them.

01:18:52.227 --> 01:18:53.894
They're feeding on the algae.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:58.816
That's where it went.
They're feeding on the algae.

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.901
Come on. Son of a bitch.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:02.403
Got it.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.616
- Thought there wasn't any life here.
- I was wrong.

01:19:08.493 --> 01:19:10.703
Where there's water
and air, there's life.

01:19:10.912 --> 01:19:14.081
Think it's so smart to take
those things with us?

01:19:14.332 --> 01:19:17.668
- You don't get how important this is.
- I'm the janitor, remember?

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.504
Earth's losing oxygen.
See how those things burned?

01:19:20.672 --> 01:19:23.007
They make it.
They eat algae, and they make O-2.

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:26.635
I finally get it.
I told you I'd solve this damn thing.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:28.637
Why are the nematodes here?

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:31.307
Because there's something left to eat.

01:19:38.690 --> 01:19:39.857
Hang on.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.657
I haven't seen green fields like this
since I was a kid.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.577
Gallagher.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:36.080
Burchenal.

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:38.082
They're eating through my suit.

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:40.876
Stay there.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.673
You'll need my air. For the launch.

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:49.218
Take this back, Gallagher.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:52.763
Accomplish the mission.

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.431
It's up to you now.

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.892
Better put your helmet on.

01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:59.687
I'm not going out like Pettengil.

01:21:12.784 --> 01:21:16.537
Commander, there is a disturbance
on the surface of Mars.

01:21:22.627 --> 01:21:24.044
Oh, God.

01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:28.841
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.
Can you hear me? Over.

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:33.220
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.
Do you copy? Over.

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:36.348
Gallagher, what's going on?
What's happened?

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:41.061
Mars ground crew, this is Mars-1.
Can you hear me? Over.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:51.447
I can't go back.

01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:54.199
There was some kind of oxygen burnoff.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.493
It was like a blowtorch.

01:21:57.329 --> 01:21:59.204
- Burchenal's gone.
- Gallagher.

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:01.790
He sacrificed himself.

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:04.168
Gallagher, where are the others?

01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:07.004
- I've got to rest.
- Gallagher.

01:22:08.006 --> 01:22:09.298
Where are the other guys?

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.177
Dead.

01:22:15.555 --> 01:22:16.680
All dead.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:21.352
- I'm the only one left.
- Gallagher, stop and listen to me.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.771
It's over.

01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:26.315
I don't know what happened tonight...

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.694
...but you have come too far
to give up now.

01:22:31.988 --> 01:22:35.199
You are going to accomplish
the mission.

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.992
I can't.

01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:41.413
Burchenal sacrificed himself for you.
You want to make that for nothing?

01:22:42.082 --> 01:22:45.501
I want you to stand up
and I want you to start walking.

01:22:48.004 --> 01:22:50.756
If you can't do it for him,
Gallagher...

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.217
- I can't.
... do it for me.

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.012
Do it for me.

01:22:59.015 --> 01:23:00.724
You have to keep going.

01:23:00.892 --> 01:23:02.226
Okay.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:34.883
Fifty-five minutes until we
need to leave orbit, commander.

01:23:41.766 --> 01:23:44.268
- Time?
Fifty-two minutes to go.

01:23:44.644 --> 01:23:45.853
Should be there by now.

01:23:47.063 --> 01:23:48.105
You're almost there.

01:23:48.648 --> 01:23:50.774
I could have screwed up
the celestial nav.

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.360
- Could be off-course.
- Trust me, you're there.

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:58.907
- Could've run right past it.
- Shut up and keep moving.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.969
I found it.

01:24:31.816 --> 01:24:34.610
Okay. What do I do now?

01:24:34.819 --> 01:24:36.820
Get rid of the sample return tray.

01:24:48.583 --> 01:24:50.459
Okay. What next?

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:54.129
There's an infrared maintenance port.
It should be marked.

01:24:55.632 --> 01:24:57.466
Marked. Yeah.

01:24:57.842 --> 01:24:59.343
In Russian.

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:03.555
All right.

01:25:03.973 --> 01:25:05.390
Got it.

01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:06.683
Now what?

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:09.103
Connect the radio to Cosmos.

01:25:09.646 --> 01:25:12.356
I'll download what you need
through the modem.

01:25:25.245 --> 01:25:26.286
Still works.

01:25:35.004 --> 01:25:36.004
Go.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:44.263
Okay, you should be able
to run diagnostics now.

01:25:54.899 --> 01:25:56.233
All green.

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:59.153
Okay, now, this thing has two settings:
On and off.

01:26:00.238 --> 01:26:02.614
Right now, "on" sends it all the way
back to Earth.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:05.450
As you lack air, food and water,
that would be bad.

01:26:05.660 --> 01:26:09.830
We want power to reach orbit. I've
recalculated for the weight of one.

01:26:10.039 --> 01:26:14.418
Take two liters out of each fuel tank.
There's a central purge.

01:26:16.337 --> 01:26:18.046
Russians couldn't add a gas gauge?

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:21.925
I'm going into comm blackout soon,
we're down to 49 minutes...

01:26:22.093 --> 01:26:24.052
...so shut up and get to work.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:36.231
Okay. What now?

01:26:36.482 --> 01:26:39.568
Launch diagnostics. Avoid pressing
anything that says "ignition. "

01:26:57.086 --> 01:26:59.463
Gallagher.

01:27:03.009 --> 01:27:04.593
Battery's dead.

01:27:10.099 --> 01:27:12.184
There's not enough power to launch.

01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:15.771
Not enough power to launch.

01:27:16.147 --> 01:27:19.107
- Anything else you can use?
- I don't know.

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:22.903
Let me look around. See if I see any
alternate high-voltage sources.

01:27:23.112 --> 01:27:24.321
No.

01:27:24.989 --> 01:27:26.531
It's just rocks.

01:27:33.289 --> 01:27:35.582
I'll die on this planet.

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:39.503
I'll stay up here
and we'll find another way.

01:27:39.671 --> 01:27:42.339
You can't stay there without burning
more fuel to hold orbit.

01:27:44.133 --> 01:27:45.634
You gotta go.

01:27:52.308 --> 01:27:53.725
How much time till blackout?

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:56.645
About a minute.

01:27:57.313 --> 01:28:00.524
Okay. There's a couple things
I gotta tell you.

01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:02.526
There's life here on Mars.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:06.655
The guys couldn't figure how they got
here, but they ate the algae...

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:09.157
...and they ate HAB too.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:11.743
The important thing...

01:28:12.453 --> 01:28:15.789
...is that they make oxygen.

01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.666
Don't know how...

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:22.296
...but Burchenal said it might
be able to save Earth...

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:27.134
...so get some guys up here quick.
Just tell them to be safe.

01:28:30.805 --> 01:28:32.472
They eat everything.

01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.811
Thirty seconds, commander.

01:28:40.064 --> 01:28:42.899
Well, that's about it. I, uh...

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:46.320
I really hate this planet.

01:28:48.906 --> 01:28:50.657
I really miss Earth.

01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:55.162
I really miss a lot of things.

01:28:57.248 --> 01:28:58.707
I, um...

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:04.671
I'm gonna miss you.

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:13.096
Aren't you gonna say anything?

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.857
I should have kissed you.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:29.404
Yeah, you should've kissed me.

01:29:36.954 --> 01:29:39.539
Comm frequency lost, commander.

01:29:53.262 --> 01:29:54.763
Goodbye.

01:30:17.745 --> 01:30:20.288
Here it comes

01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:23.166
Here it comes

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:56.408
Alternate high-voltage energy source.

01:30:57.743 --> 01:30:59.453
Come and get me.

01:31:01.205 --> 01:31:03.498
I'm gonna steal your batteries,
sweetie.

01:33:31.981 --> 01:33:33.440
Bye, sweetie.

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:50.475
I'm going home.

01:35:06.951 --> 01:35:08.576
Fuck this planet.

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.745
Oxygen supply is low.

01:35:58.377 --> 01:36:00.503
Warning. Object in orbital path.

01:36:00.671 --> 01:36:02.422
Oh, my God. Gallagher.

01:36:04.216 --> 01:36:05.258
Abort!

01:36:05.509 --> 01:36:08.428
Re-route orbital maneuvering.
I need pitch. Roll!

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:10.680
Yaw. Ten-millimeter bursts.

01:36:44.924 --> 01:36:46.758
Seal this level.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:49.552
Level sealed.

01:36:53.349 --> 01:36:54.390
Open the dock.

01:37:11.784 --> 01:37:14.410
Targeted object,.3 kilometers.

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:17.747
We only have five minutes
before Mars-1 leaves orbit, commander.

01:37:17.957 --> 01:37:19.916
Hook me up, Lucille!

01:37:22.253 --> 01:37:24.379
Line release! Full velocity!

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:53.283
Gallagher!

01:38:00.499 --> 01:38:02.041
Retract.

01:38:19.184 --> 01:38:21.144
Ninety-millimeter bursts!

01:38:42.082 --> 01:38:45.084
Seal! Emergency atmosphere now!

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:50.173
Atmosphere restored.

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:11.444
Linking to suit computer.

01:39:11.695 --> 01:39:13.613
Gallagher's vital signs are negative.

01:39:13.822 --> 01:39:16.199
Bioscan indicates cardiac arrest.

01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:45.061
Come on!

01:39:50.609 --> 01:39:52.402
Stand him up, commander.

01:39:52.611 --> 01:39:53.903
Come on.

01:40:15.884 --> 01:40:17.301
Aw, man.

01:40:19.054 --> 01:40:20.972
I saw Elvis.

01:40:29.023 --> 01:40:30.982
Let's go home, Lucille.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:50.209
Organism bioscan. DNA mapping.

01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:54.547
Hard to believe they're the good guys.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:57.341
Do you think it was worth it?

01:40:59.511 --> 01:41:01.345
Houston thinks so.

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:04.932
On Earth, they're calling you a hero,
Gallagher.

01:41:06.101 --> 01:41:08.978
God works in mysterious ways.

01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:13.524
A memento?

01:41:15.152 --> 01:41:17.862
It's for Chantilas' granddaughter.

01:41:22.117 --> 01:41:23.826
He had faith.

01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:38.591
You are not who I thought you were.

01:41:49.645 --> 01:41:52.355
Nothing went the way
it was supposed to.

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:56.776
But the team, mankind
at its best and its worst...

01:41:56.985 --> 01:41:58.945
...accomplished the mission.

01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:06.702
Maybe Chantilas was right.
Maybe it isn't just the science.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.454
I sure don't know.

01:42:08.705 --> 01:42:11.916
But whatever forces were at work,
we triumphed.

01:42:13.085 --> 01:42:16.504
And me? I've got six months
before we get home.

01:42:16.713 --> 01:42:18.464
I guess I'll get to know the janitor.
