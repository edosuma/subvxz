02:02.054 --> 02:03.323
Shit, is that me?

02:12.098 --> 02:14.097
Hey, Mom.

02:14.099 --> 02:15.733
It's late.

02:15.735 --> 02:16.402
Will you hold on?

02:32.985 --> 02:35.518
Well, is he keeping
any food down?

02:35.520 --> 02:37.487
Not much.

02:37.489 --> 02:40.023
The drugs make him so nauseous.

02:40.025 --> 02:41.291
I'll come home soon, Mom.

02:41.293 --> 02:43.393
We know
you're busy, honey.

02:43.395 --> 02:44.728
I don't mean to worry you.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.030
I'll send a little bit
extra this month, OK?

02:47.032 --> 02:47.866
OK, Carson.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.585
Looking fresh, buddy.

03:09.587 --> 03:11.822
Somebody got their seven hours.

03:11.824 --> 03:15.459
Did you forward me the
new beta project solutions?

03:15.461 --> 03:17.193
- Morning, Marcy!
- Morning.

03:17.195 --> 03:18.362
How are you?

03:18.364 --> 03:19.630
Excellent!

03:19.632 --> 03:20.498
Coffee?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.800
Uh, that'd be great.
Thanks.

03:26.271 --> 03:28.137
Morning.

03:28.139 --> 03:30.139
You should've woken me up.

03:30.141 --> 03:31.375
Wow.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.309
You did work late.

03:32.311 --> 03:34.578
You slept here?

03:34.580 --> 03:35.812
Oh my god.

03:35.814 --> 03:37.012
You guys get my email?

03:37.014 --> 03:37.815
No.

03:37.817 --> 03:38.582
What was it?

03:38.584 --> 03:39.583
It was a hilarious video.

03:39.585 --> 03:41.217
A compilation of tech fails.

03:41.219 --> 03:42.585
Since when do
you send us emails?

03:42.587 --> 03:45.054
Are you guys talking
about that video?

03:45.056 --> 03:46.891
It was fantastic, Eric!

03:46.893 --> 03:47.858
Fantastic.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.059
I want to see it now.

03:49.061 --> 03:49.959
Nope.

03:49.961 --> 03:50.960
Watch it on your phone.

03:50.962 --> 03:51.762
It's not very good quality.

03:51.764 --> 03:54.864
I'm right here.

03:54.866 --> 03:55.534
Here you go.

04:04.810 --> 04:05.508
Well, um...

04:05.510 --> 04:06.478
Just give it a minute.

04:09.014 --> 04:10.047
Cool.

04:10.049 --> 04:10.913
Thanks.

04:10.915 --> 04:12.016
Yeah, yeah.

04:12.018 --> 04:14.653
Any time.
Are you OK, Carson?

04:18.690 --> 04:21.324
I'm going to make
some phone calls.

04:25.497 --> 04:27.264
Hey, remember we've
got team drinks tonight.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.166
Carson, you pick a spot?

04:29.168 --> 04:30.399
Yeah, he did.

04:30.401 --> 04:31.403
It better not be
in the Marina again.

06:23.348 --> 06:24.348
There you are.

06:24.350 --> 06:25.849
Jesus, what happened to you?

06:25.851 --> 06:27.517
I'm fine.

06:27.519 --> 06:28.485
Clean yourself up.

06:28.487 --> 06:31.889
They'll be here any minute.

06:31.891 --> 06:32.956
Carson?

06:32.958 --> 06:36.325
You need to do something
about all of that.

06:36.327 --> 06:39.897
Yeah, sorry.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.798
Carson?

06:41.800 --> 06:43.332
Where did you go last night?

06:43.334 --> 06:45.267
I texted you like 50 times.

06:45.269 --> 06:46.103
I went home.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.337
Seriously?

06:47.339 --> 06:49.038
You can't treat me
like some booty call.

06:49.040 --> 06:49.973
I'm not.

06:49.975 --> 06:51.110
I passed out right
when I got home.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.148
Are you OK?

06:57.682 --> 06:58.918
I need to get ready.

07:18.303 --> 07:22.105
This seems like a lot
based on projections alone.

07:22.107 --> 07:24.074
Do you guys always offer
this much when you haven't

07:24.076 --> 07:25.509
seen a functioning beta?

07:25.511 --> 07:28.478
To expedite the
beta, is what you mean.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.546
No, let's not.

07:29.548 --> 07:30.846
We shouldn't rush the launch.

07:30.848 --> 07:32.515
This feels like rushing money.

07:32.517 --> 07:34.050
There's
just a whole lot there.

07:34.052 --> 07:35.218
Wait a minute.

07:35.220 --> 07:37.021
To answer your question, no.

07:37.023 --> 07:39.822
We never make an offer this
size without seeing a beta.

07:39.824 --> 07:43.125
But your track record
speaks for itself.

07:43.127 --> 07:44.327
We want it.

07:44.329 --> 07:45.562
We're not just
investing in a product.

07:45.564 --> 07:49.533
We're investing in
a product you built.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.202
Our firm is not known
for reckless investment.

07:52.204 --> 07:54.204
But frankly, this
doesn't feel like a risk.

07:54.206 --> 07:55.238
No, no.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.005
It's not.

07:56.007 --> 07:57.207
It's not a risk.

07:57.209 --> 08:00.743
No, we're so... we'll take
a look at your proposal

08:00.745 --> 08:05.582
in more detail, and we will
give you a call this week.

08:05.584 --> 08:07.620
- Thank you.
- Speak soon.

08:13.425 --> 08:14.791
Great, fantastic.

08:14.793 --> 08:16.262
We'll be in touch soon.

08:19.331 --> 08:20.529
How did it go?

08:20.531 --> 08:22.067
Bigger offer than last time.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.272
We need to keep them
sweet, flirt a little.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.741
Marcy, when can we get a
mockup of the site layout?

08:32.744 --> 08:33.642
We need a few more days.

08:33.644 --> 08:34.677
A few more days?

08:34.679 --> 08:35.712
Do we need to get you some help?

08:35.715 --> 08:37.446
No, I just need
a few more days.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.015
Eric, how close?
Eric?

08:39.018 --> 08:39.948
Yeah?

08:39.951 --> 08:41.049
How close are
you with the beta?

08:41.052 --> 08:42.451
I'm still coding.

08:42.453 --> 08:43.453
Urgency, people.

08:43.455 --> 08:44.421
Urgency!

09:42.648 --> 09:44.080
...early hours this morning,

09:44.082 --> 09:46.983
he was walking home in this
very quiet neighborhood.

09:46.985 --> 09:49.252
It's unclear why he
was out at that hour,

09:49.254 --> 09:52.122
but we understand he also
worked late at a tech company

09:52.124 --> 09:55.559
downtown, where his colleagues
describe him as hard

09:55.561 --> 09:57.361
working and full of energy.

09:57.363 --> 10:00.564
It's unclear how long he
lay on the side of the road

10:00.566 --> 10:02.967
before a jogger
discovered him at 5 AM,

10:02.969 --> 10:05.368
but had the driver of
the vehicle that struck

10:05.370 --> 10:08.539
him stopped and called
for help, Jordan Berg

10:08.541 --> 10:09.873
might still be alive.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.941
Police have little to
go on and are appealing

10:11.943 --> 10:13.710
to the public for help.

10:13.712 --> 10:16.646
If you remember seeing
anything, hearing anything...

12:07.359 --> 12:08.690
Did you know him?

12:08.692 --> 12:10.459
- Huh?
- Jordan.

12:10.461 --> 12:12.195
Did you know him?

12:12.197 --> 12:16.932
I um... we met at a
conference a few months ago.

12:16.934 --> 12:18.501
How did you know him?

12:18.503 --> 12:20.036
He was my neighbor.

12:20.038 --> 12:21.637
Oh.

12:21.639 --> 12:24.675
We lived in the same building.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.810
I meant to bring flowers,
but I thought maybe a donation

12:27.812 --> 12:28.514
would have been better.

12:31.383 --> 12:34.349
What did you say
your name was again?

12:34.351 --> 12:36.752
Carson Griffin.

12:36.754 --> 12:38.488
And you are?

12:38.490 --> 12:39.454
Harper.

12:39.456 --> 12:40.259
Nice to meet you, Harper.

12:43.128 --> 12:46.195
So you work for a start up?

12:46.197 --> 12:48.397
Don't we all?

12:48.399 --> 12:49.367
What's it called?

12:52.571 --> 12:53.239
I'm just curious.

12:58.476 --> 13:00.008
It was nice to meet you, Carson.

13:00.010 --> 13:01.212
Maybe I'll see you around.

13:11.389 --> 13:12.022
Hello?

13:12.024 --> 13:13.556
Hey, I'm outside.

13:13.558 --> 13:14.225
Oh, hey.

13:34.278 --> 13:35.145
Hey.

13:35.147 --> 13:35.815
Hey.

13:41.019 --> 13:43.454
- Wait.
- What?

13:47.893 --> 13:49.493
Wait.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.160
I want to talk to you.

13:51.162 --> 13:54.796
What do you want
to talk about?

13:54.798 --> 13:56.599
Did you think
about what I said?

13:56.601 --> 13:58.468
About what?

13:58.470 --> 13:59.569
Us?

13:59.571 --> 14:01.338
Being official?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.507
I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.241
Why not?

14:05.243 --> 14:06.977
We're pretty much
in a relationship.

14:06.979 --> 14:10.313
I don't understand why you
want to keep it a secret.

14:10.315 --> 14:12.549
Marcy, I don't have
time for this right now.

14:12.551 --> 14:13.749
Oh really?

14:13.751 --> 14:15.285
Because it seemed
like you had time

14:15.287 --> 14:16.551
to fuck me when I walked through
the door two minutes ago.

14:16.553 --> 14:17.887
No.
Look...

14:17.889 --> 14:19.156
Do you like me?

14:19.158 --> 14:20.823
Or do you just like
having sex with me?

14:20.825 --> 14:24.363
- I do like you.
- Then what is it?

14:28.133 --> 14:31.001
I don't think it's the
right time to do this.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.002
Why not?

14:33.004 --> 14:35.039
Look, I have some
work I need to finish.

14:41.580 --> 14:43.278
Don't stay up too late.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.583
You're getting dark
circles under your eyes.

15:17.581 --> 15:18.350
It's Vince.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.153
Hello?

15:25.224 --> 15:26.555
Vince.

15:26.557 --> 15:27.424
Hi.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.124
Hey.

15:29.126 --> 15:31.527
I thought I'd check in on you.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.897
Bought you some grub.

15:33.899 --> 15:34.933
How are you doing?

15:37.702 --> 15:39.334
You should have called.

15:39.336 --> 15:41.070
OK.
I should have called.

15:41.072 --> 15:42.103
I'm sorry.

15:42.105 --> 15:43.705
I have some dinner.

15:43.707 --> 15:44.375
I already ate.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.718
I just got back
from the station.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.352
You want to hear
what's going on?

15:56.354 --> 15:59.589
No, not right now, Vince.

15:59.591 --> 16:02.027
Well, you can make some
of that for lunch tomorrow.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.964
Give me a call if you
feel like talking.

16:07.966 --> 16:09.301
Thanks for the food.

16:12.003 --> 16:14.206
Look, I get that you're angry.

16:16.841 --> 16:19.608
But can you work
with me on this?

16:19.610 --> 16:22.044
I just want to find out
what happened to my brother.

16:22.046 --> 16:24.914
Just please call
next time you come.

16:24.916 --> 16:25.551
OK.

18:14.058 --> 18:14.923
Carson!

18:14.925 --> 18:16.492
Hey bud.

18:16.494 --> 18:17.626
I didn't know you were here.

18:17.628 --> 18:19.662
Where's the t-bird?

18:19.664 --> 18:21.264
It needed to charge.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.132
Oh, do you?

18:24.134 --> 18:25.501
More coffee?

18:25.503 --> 18:26.334
Sure.

18:26.336 --> 18:27.236
I'll get our assistant on it.

18:27.238 --> 18:29.173
Oh wait, that's me!

18:56.099 --> 18:56.868
What are you working on?

19:04.075 --> 19:06.742
Eric, what are you working on?

19:06.744 --> 19:09.644
Just a side project
I've been tinkering with.

19:09.646 --> 19:11.847
Our stuff is going
smoothly, so...

19:11.849 --> 19:13.882
What is it?

19:13.884 --> 19:16.952
It's still pretty rough.

19:16.954 --> 19:19.354
Don't get behind
on my stuff, OK?

19:19.356 --> 19:23.159
Run another high volume
test on the beta.

19:46.483 --> 19:48.351
Want to grab some dinner?

19:48.353 --> 19:51.519
I have to finish
a few things up.

19:51.521 --> 19:53.288
You don't need to stay late.

19:53.290 --> 19:56.860
I have a few people
interviewing tomorrow.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.496
Maybe we can unload some
of this work to new talent.

20:00.498 --> 20:01.700
We don't need any more help.

20:04.402 --> 20:06.835
I have a job to do, too.

20:06.837 --> 20:08.604
Make this place run.

20:08.606 --> 20:10.439
It just doesn't work
if you're exhausted

20:10.441 --> 20:12.241
from working late every night.

20:12.243 --> 20:13.742
I like working late.

20:13.744 --> 20:17.046
Let's expand into the
money we're being offered.

20:17.048 --> 20:18.948
It's not ridiculous to
want to hire more people.

20:18.950 --> 20:22.084
I mean, we've got all these
computers and no one on them.

20:22.086 --> 20:23.719
Hey, no.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.255
Carson, yes!

20:25.257 --> 20:26.823
Cancel the interviews.

20:41.740 --> 20:42.939
Hey, Mom.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.707
I'm still at the office.

20:44.709 --> 20:47.209
Oh, well,
I'm sorry to bother you.

20:47.211 --> 20:48.577
What's up?

20:48.579 --> 20:50.446
The
check hasn't arrived yet.

20:50.448 --> 20:52.849
I just wanted to confirm
that you sent it?

20:52.851 --> 20:55.384
Yeah, I sent it.

20:55.386 --> 20:57.420
It's, um, in the mail.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.853
Should be there in a few days.

20:58.855 --> 21:01.024
I'm just
falling behind a bit

21:01.026 --> 21:02.892
on your dad's doctor bills.

21:02.894 --> 21:03.692
Use the credit card, Mom.

21:03.694 --> 21:04.959
That's why I got it for you.

21:04.961 --> 21:05.694
OK.

21:05.696 --> 21:06.562
I'll do that.

21:06.564 --> 21:09.899
I just like to let you know.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.401
Anyway, I'll let you go.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.401
Bye, Mom.

21:12.403 --> 21:13.372
I love you.

21:36.994 --> 21:38.193
I still want you 'round.

21:38.195 --> 21:40.363
I still want you
'round, 'round, 'round.

21:40.365 --> 21:42.332
Back there, I can't
look you in the eye.

21:42.334 --> 21:44.232
Hey, will you make a stop?

21:44.234 --> 21:45.234
Right here?

21:45.236 --> 21:46.736
Yeah, I'll be two seconds.

21:49.140 --> 21:51.507
Say what you wanted to say.

21:51.509 --> 21:57.479
I promise you I'm
back in if stay.

22:27.310 --> 22:28.311
Hi.

22:28.313 --> 22:30.112
Yeah.

22:30.114 --> 22:31.982
Well, did he say when he'd
be able to call me back?

22:34.986 --> 22:36.352
OK.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.287
Thank you.

22:44.895 --> 22:45.928
Hi, yeah.

22:45.930 --> 22:47.699
We are getting back
to you right away.

22:51.736 --> 22:53.839
Can I talk to you about the
font mock ups for the website?

23:02.747 --> 23:04.146
What's going on with you?

23:04.148 --> 23:05.581
Where are the mockups?

23:05.583 --> 23:06.882
I don't have them yet.

23:06.884 --> 23:08.418
I want to talk about
how you've been acting.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.485
I need the designs, Marcy.

23:09.487 --> 23:11.152
Work comes first.

23:11.154 --> 23:12.455
No.

23:12.457 --> 23:15.623
Talk to me first, then
you'll get your mockups.

23:15.625 --> 23:17.892
Either you tell me, or
I'll figure it out myself.

23:17.894 --> 23:20.095
Those mock ups better be at
my desk by the end of the day.

23:20.097 --> 23:20.765
Or what?

23:24.769 --> 23:26.869
Please, just give
me the mockups.

23:26.871 --> 23:28.874
Did you get that
message I sent you?

23:32.009 --> 23:33.509
Is everything OK?

23:33.511 --> 23:36.612
Carson's upset because
I missed my deadline.

23:36.614 --> 23:39.047
Well, it takes time.

23:39.049 --> 23:39.949
I'll talk to him, OK?

23:39.951 --> 23:41.118
We're going to
get you an intern.

23:51.462 --> 23:52.129
Carson?

23:54.732 --> 23:56.532
You don't remember me.

23:56.534 --> 23:58.700
I think I do.

23:58.702 --> 24:00.303
I'll throw you a bone.
It's Harper.

24:00.305 --> 24:02.371
We met at Jordan's memorial.

24:02.373 --> 24:03.139
That's right.

24:03.141 --> 24:04.507
Hi, Harper.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.674
Sorry, I'm juggling
a lot right now.

24:06.676 --> 24:09.812
No, I'm sorry
for bothering you.

24:09.814 --> 24:11.546
I just taught a class
at Magnet School,

24:11.548 --> 24:13.649
thought I'd get some lunch.

24:13.651 --> 24:16.184
Do you want to come?

24:16.186 --> 24:17.952
Sorry, is that weird?

24:17.954 --> 24:19.287
A little bit.

24:19.289 --> 24:20.956
So is that a yes?

24:20.958 --> 24:23.258
I wish I could.

24:23.260 --> 24:27.930
Well, do you mind recommending
a place around here?

24:27.932 --> 24:32.168
There's a good cafe a couple
of blocks that way to the left.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.504
- OK.
- You know what?

24:34.506 --> 24:36.538
- I'll show you.
- Really?

24:36.540 --> 24:39.441
You have the time?

24:39.443 --> 24:41.410
So how's your day going?

24:41.412 --> 24:43.245
Fine.

24:43.247 --> 24:45.680
What are you working on?

24:45.682 --> 24:48.220
- An investment platform.
- Cool.

24:52.923 --> 24:55.591
So I run an after
school arts program,

24:55.593 --> 24:57.626
and I had this
little girl today ask

24:57.628 --> 24:59.495
if we could make birthday
cards, because it

24:59.497 --> 25:01.264
was her dad's birthday.

25:01.266 --> 25:03.164
So they all made cards.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.901
My god, I wish I could be
there when they deliver 20

25:05.903 --> 25:09.171
handmade cards by 6-year-olds.

25:09.173 --> 25:10.506
Can you imagine?

25:10.508 --> 25:12.440
I can't.

25:12.442 --> 25:15.376
It's better than
e-cards, right?

25:15.378 --> 25:17.846
I mean, I think so.

25:17.848 --> 25:19.449
So what's got you stressed?

25:19.451 --> 25:20.816
Stressed?

25:20.818 --> 25:23.219
Yeah, you said you
were juggling a lot.

25:23.221 --> 25:27.556
I've got this interview
for a magazine tomorrow.

25:27.558 --> 25:30.058
Well be sure to
tell them the truth.

25:30.060 --> 25:30.860
Excuse me?

25:30.862 --> 25:32.461
Tell them the truth.

25:32.463 --> 25:35.498
You've got to let them know
you're stressed and nervous.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.399
I mean, it's what
makes us human, right?

25:37.401 --> 25:39.401
And not just another app.

25:39.403 --> 25:40.572
It's refreshing.

25:44.409 --> 25:48.376
Do you do a lot
of work around here?

25:48.378 --> 25:50.344
Sometimes.

25:50.346 --> 25:52.748
You?

25:52.750 --> 25:56.885
Well, that's the
place over there.

25:56.887 --> 25:58.319
Give me a call next
time you're around.

25:58.321 --> 26:01.623
I'll buy you lunch.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.961
Thanks for escorting
me, Mr. Carson Griffin.

27:24.107 --> 27:25.474
They love this!

27:25.476 --> 27:26.842
Carson, you killed it!

27:26.844 --> 27:27.709
No, you killed it.

27:27.711 --> 27:29.344
No, you killed it!

27:29.346 --> 27:30.946
I want to celebrate.

27:30.948 --> 27:32.014
Let's get champers.

27:32.016 --> 27:33.449
Marcy, you want to come pick?

27:33.451 --> 27:34.982
- Let's get Cristal.
- OK!

27:34.984 --> 27:36.687
Yeah, is that the one you like?

27:44.595 --> 27:45.561
Hi.

27:45.563 --> 27:46.398
This is Carson Griffin.

27:47.397 --> 27:49.431
Hey.

27:49.433 --> 27:50.298
Hey.

27:50.300 --> 27:50.967
Who is this?

27:50.969 --> 27:51.967
I'm going to take off.

27:51.969 --> 27:52.933
Do your thing, man.

27:52.935 --> 27:54.068
Harper.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.171
How did your interview go?

27:56.173 --> 27:57.271
Harper?

27:57.273 --> 27:58.606
How did you get my...

27:58.608 --> 28:00.176
You gave it to me.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.375
Oh, yeah.

28:01.377 --> 28:02.577
Well,
you said to call next time

28:02.579 --> 28:05.013
I'm around, and I'm around.

28:05.015 --> 28:07.149
Are you going to buy me dinner?

28:07.151 --> 28:11.585
Um, yeah, OK.

28:11.587 --> 28:14.623
The interview went phenomenally
well, so I guess I owe you one,

28:14.625 --> 28:15.690
don't I?

28:15.692 --> 28:17.926
I'm cashing in,
Carson Griffin.

28:17.928 --> 28:19.197
- Let's do it.
- Great.

28:26.604 --> 28:28.136
They were trying
get us to talk

28:28.138 --> 28:31.340
about the threat of regulation,
and we're expecting that.

28:31.342 --> 28:33.375
But we just kept bringing
it back to what we see

28:33.377 --> 28:36.578
is the need for a new seed
funding model, something that's

28:36.580 --> 28:37.912
not full blown
venture capitalist,

28:37.914 --> 28:39.614
but it's also not a
loan from the bank.

28:39.616 --> 28:40.748
Mhm.

28:40.750 --> 28:42.250
The idea came
out of recognizing

28:42.252 --> 28:43.986
that many of the projects
on traditional crowdfunding

28:43.988 --> 28:46.488
platforms are actually viable
investment opportunities.

28:46.490 --> 28:51.259
They're just limited by
donation based fundraising, so...

28:51.261 --> 28:52.931
I'm boring you
already, aren't I?

28:56.099 --> 28:58.168
So how do you feel
about everything?

29:03.040 --> 29:06.842
I'm afraid I'm
going to fuck it up.

29:06.844 --> 29:09.443
Did you say that
in the interview?

29:09.445 --> 29:12.014
Not in those words.

29:12.016 --> 29:13.351
Is being afraid new for you?

29:16.353 --> 29:19.321
When I launched my first
app, it was exciting.

29:19.323 --> 29:21.457
I was in my bedroom.

29:21.459 --> 29:24.559
Now with all the
expectations, I just feel

29:24.561 --> 29:26.828
destined to crash and burn.

29:26.830 --> 29:28.563
Yeah, but what's the
worst that could happen

29:28.565 --> 29:29.400
if you crashed and burned?

29:33.336 --> 29:34.902
Lose everything.

29:34.904 --> 29:38.173
Let everyone down.

29:38.175 --> 29:39.409
Do you regret having tried?

29:43.079 --> 29:43.981
That's hard to say.

29:49.153 --> 29:52.891
Have you ever done anything
that you really regret?

29:57.095 --> 29:59.931
Like anything that you feel
really bad or guilty about?

30:02.599 --> 30:03.267
Haven't we all?

30:47.978 --> 30:50.679
Why is it so freezing
all of a sudden?

30:50.681 --> 30:52.948
Well, you know,
Hunter S. Thompson

30:52.950 --> 30:54.850
said "the coldest
winter I ever spent

30:54.852 --> 30:58.687
was a summer in San Francisco."

30:58.689 --> 31:01.556
Mark Twain said that.

31:01.558 --> 31:03.625
Oh, you're right.

31:07.731 --> 31:08.866
Do you need to get back?

31:11.501 --> 31:12.534
It's my mom.

31:12.536 --> 31:13.238
I'll call her back.

31:16.273 --> 31:18.840
You said your family
lives in the valley, right?

31:18.842 --> 31:22.010
Yeah, it's nothing like this.

31:22.012 --> 31:23.981
There's nowhere
else like this.

31:30.753 --> 31:33.555
My dad has cancer.

31:33.557 --> 31:35.591
He's really sick.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.726
My mom stopped working
to take care of him,

31:37.728 --> 31:39.964
so I help them out financially.

31:40.830 --> 31:42.663
Must be hard.

31:42.665 --> 31:44.933
I'm never there.

31:44.935 --> 31:47.004
I feel like I'm letting
them down by being here.

31:49.539 --> 31:51.873
I just can't stand
seeing him like that.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.310
I know it's awful, but...

32:08.625 --> 32:11.093
Team dinner tonight?

32:11.095 --> 32:13.894
What do you guys think?
Marcy?

32:13.896 --> 32:15.663
You wanted curry the other day.

32:15.665 --> 32:16.931
Does that craving still stand?

32:16.933 --> 32:18.033
Or pizza.

32:18.035 --> 32:19.200
Even better.
Eric?

32:19.202 --> 32:22.238
- Pizza?
- I'm playing Halo.

32:22.240 --> 32:22.904
Right.

32:22.906 --> 32:23.939
Sure.

32:23.941 --> 32:25.774
How very social of you.

32:25.776 --> 32:26.807
Carson?

32:26.809 --> 32:28.744
I can't tonight, sorry.
Oh.

32:28.746 --> 32:31.645
Why?
What are you up to?

32:31.647 --> 32:33.347
I'm just busy.

32:33.349 --> 32:35.316
You never miss
our team dinners.

32:35.318 --> 32:37.518
Well, usually they're
planned further in advance.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.188
Carson?

32:40.990 --> 32:42.160
What was that about?

32:55.172 --> 32:57.105
Are you going to tell
me what's going on?

32:57.107 --> 32:59.106
I'm going over the
shortlist for our last trial.

32:59.108 --> 33:00.808
I mean, in general.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.177
You mean after I leave work?

33:02.179 --> 33:03.612
How is that any
of your business?

33:03.614 --> 33:05.980
Because it's affecting
your work and this company.

33:05.982 --> 33:06.882
I can't have that.

33:06.884 --> 33:08.549
All eyes are on us.

33:08.551 --> 33:10.986
My company.

33:10.988 --> 33:13.355
Our company.

33:13.357 --> 33:14.155
Mine too.

33:14.157 --> 33:15.323
Are we done?

33:15.325 --> 33:16.458
No.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.727
Those two people out
there, they trust you.

33:18.729 --> 33:20.261
And they trusted me.

33:20.263 --> 33:22.797
We all gave up a lot of shit
because we believed in you.

33:22.799 --> 33:26.367
Now get out of your own way.

33:26.369 --> 33:28.605
And I am scheduling interviews.

33:42.251 --> 33:43.986
You're trying to get me drunk.

33:43.988 --> 33:45.390
Well I don't want
you to be thirsty.

33:47.924 --> 33:49.623
I'm getting drunk too.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.392
Hope you like pork.

33:51.394 --> 33:53.161
Oh, I'm actually a vegetarian.

33:53.163 --> 33:54.496
And a Muslim, so...

33:54.498 --> 33:56.765
Oh, well, you'll
love the salad then.

33:56.767 --> 33:58.334
It's mixed greens.

33:58.336 --> 33:59.534
Simple.

33:59.536 --> 34:00.768
I mean, I thought you
were trying to impress me.

34:00.770 --> 34:02.671
It's classic, not simple.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.573
And who said I was
trying to impress you?

34:04.575 --> 34:05.774
Oh, I don't know.

34:05.776 --> 34:09.110
Do you always do wine
pairings with every meal?

34:09.112 --> 34:13.248
Sauvignon Blanc is
delicious with cereal.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.983
Instead of milk?

34:14.985 --> 34:17.885
Like poured over the cereal?

34:17.887 --> 34:18.786
What is wrong with you?

34:18.789 --> 34:21.556
No, instead of OJ.

34:21.559 --> 34:22.791
Obviously.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.626
Now, go over there.

34:24.628 --> 34:25.594
Can I help?

34:25.596 --> 34:27.094
How can I impress
you if you're

34:27.097 --> 34:28.731
overwhelmed by your
sense of responsibility?

34:28.733 --> 34:29.367
Fine.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.608
Like this?

34:39.610 --> 34:41.510
Perfect.

35:27.257 --> 35:29.891
I should go home.

35:29.893 --> 35:31.092
Everything OK?

35:31.094 --> 35:32.695
We drank a lot.

35:32.697 --> 35:33.662
Don't go.

35:33.664 --> 35:35.296
I know a place that
sells ice cream.

35:35.298 --> 35:38.768
It's still open.
Please?

35:42.106 --> 35:44.673
It's late.

35:44.675 --> 35:45.706
Fine.

35:45.708 --> 35:48.812
- I'll drive you home.
- Are you kidding?

35:54.585 --> 35:55.918
You're right.

35:55.920 --> 35:56.721
I'll call you an Uber.

36:49.806 --> 36:52.106
Talk to me.

36:52.108 --> 36:53.474
Vince?

36:53.476 --> 36:57.146
Yeah, what's up?

36:57.148 --> 36:59.914
Are you crying?
What's wrong?

36:59.916 --> 37:00.551
Where are you?

37:05.856 --> 37:07.289
What's going on?

37:07.291 --> 37:08.523
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

37:08.525 --> 37:10.693
I'm fine.
You didn't have to come over.

37:10.695 --> 37:15.164
You didn't sound fine,
and you don't look fine.

37:15.166 --> 37:15.900
Where were you tonight?

37:19.635 --> 37:23.405
I was just out with
friends and I got upset.

37:23.407 --> 37:24.642
Which friends?

37:29.012 --> 37:30.411
I just think I'm tired.

37:30.413 --> 37:32.579
I need to go to bed.

37:32.581 --> 37:34.316
Thank you for checking on me.

37:34.318 --> 37:36.150
Of course.

37:36.152 --> 37:38.219
Hey.

37:38.221 --> 37:39.322
We're in this together, right?

37:47.831 --> 37:48.463
Get some rest.

37:48.465 --> 37:49.333
Call me tomorrow.

38:57.067 --> 38:59.570
Don't forget our 9:30, please.

39:50.686 --> 39:52.920
- Marcy?
- Shut up.

39:52.922 --> 39:53.590
Marcy.

40:01.231 --> 40:02.563
Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

40:02.565 --> 40:03.634
I said shut up.

40:30.226 --> 40:31.592
Hello?

40:31.594 --> 40:33.293
- Hey, it's me.
- Carson!

40:33.295 --> 40:34.496
You're early.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.865
Yeah, can I come up?

40:36.867 --> 40:37.632
Yeah, sure.

40:37.634 --> 40:40.235
I... I'm just getting ready.

41:33.222 --> 41:33.987
Hey.

41:33.989 --> 41:36.224
Hi.

41:36.226 --> 41:38.526
Nice place.

41:38.528 --> 41:39.459
Thanks.

41:39.461 --> 41:41.729
Um, two seconds.

41:41.731 --> 41:43.032
I will be ready
before you know it.

41:51.307 --> 41:53.441
Are you moving or something?

41:53.443 --> 41:55.010
Um, yeah.

41:55.012 --> 41:57.813
Kind of.

41:57.815 --> 42:00.382
You're kind of moving?

42:00.384 --> 42:03.686
Yeah, the neighborhood's
just gotten too expensive.

42:08.858 --> 42:10.961
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's fine.

42:13.697 --> 42:16.634
It's not really
my taste anymore.

42:21.103 --> 42:23.137
I'm just going to
brush my teeth.

42:23.139 --> 42:25.308
Honestly, like two seconds.
Sorry!

42:45.695 --> 42:47.797
Carson?

43:05.215 --> 43:06.615
Carson, wait!

43:06.617 --> 43:07.615
Stop!

43:07.617 --> 43:09.182
Carson!

43:31.907 --> 43:33.807
Who was that guy you just
chased out of the building?

43:33.809 --> 43:35.008
Get out!

43:35.010 --> 43:36.510
You can't just let
yourself in here!

43:36.512 --> 43:37.912
- Oh, really?
- Get out!

43:37.914 --> 43:40.215
This is my brother's
fucking place!

43:40.217 --> 43:41.619
Who was it?

43:51.795 --> 43:53.161
Don't you fucking
lie to me, June.

43:53.163 --> 43:54.764
Is that who you were
with the other night?

43:57.934 --> 43:59.833
So help me God, June,
if you are withholding

43:59.835 --> 44:01.068
information from me.

44:01.070 --> 44:01.969
What?

44:01.971 --> 44:05.740
What are you going to do?

44:05.742 --> 44:09.577
You are the reason
he was out that night.

44:17.320 --> 44:20.387
I'm not the reason he
was in Pacific Heights.

44:20.389 --> 44:21.290
He made that choice himself.

44:25.327 --> 44:27.096
You're a piece of fucking
work, you know that?

44:30.699 --> 44:32.301
No wonder Jordan was
fucking someone else.

46:22.045 --> 46:23.878
Last September.

46:23.880 --> 46:26.213
They didn't plan a
traditional ceremony, oh no.

46:26.215 --> 46:30.552
They staged a live rock opera.

46:30.554 --> 46:32.052
How cool is that, right?

46:32.054 --> 46:35.055
The show was a combination
of a modern San Francisco

46:35.057 --> 46:39.526
love story, two local musicians
who found love through fandom.

46:39.528 --> 46:43.764
Now Garza is the lead singer
of the indie rock band...

46:43.766 --> 46:46.767
Hello?

46:46.769 --> 46:48.769
Hey, it's Carson.

46:48.771 --> 46:50.240
Can I come up?

46:58.547 --> 46:59.215
Harper?

47:04.686 --> 47:06.588
Um, Harper is my middle name.

47:06.590 --> 47:10.525
It's what I go by
sometimes outside of work.

47:10.527 --> 47:12.059
Sorry.

47:12.061 --> 47:14.528
You know, I haven't been
completely honest about myself

47:14.530 --> 47:16.563
either.

47:16.565 --> 47:17.798
In what way?

47:17.800 --> 47:19.633
I'm a tech guy.

47:19.635 --> 47:21.334
It's not really me.

47:21.336 --> 47:24.671
I want you to know the
real me, just like I

47:24.673 --> 47:25.474
want to know the real you.

47:29.045 --> 47:33.981
You don't actually go by
Harper all that often, do you?

47:33.983 --> 47:38.222
- Is it OK if I call you Harper?
- Sure.

47:42.958 --> 47:45.025
I don't have a
middle name, so you'll

47:45.027 --> 47:47.829
just have to call me Carson.

47:47.831 --> 47:49.162
Or Griffin.

47:49.164 --> 47:50.865
No.

47:50.867 --> 47:54.302
I don't want you reminding me
of my high school soccer coach.

47:54.304 --> 47:55.606
You're way too cute for that.

48:18.228 --> 48:21.128
I need this statement for
the launch press release.

48:21.130 --> 48:23.231
Yeah, I'm still working on it.

48:23.233 --> 48:25.766
You said you would give it
to me by the end of last week.

48:25.768 --> 48:27.068
I'll get it.

48:27.070 --> 48:30.838
So it's OK for you
to miss your deadlines?

48:30.840 --> 48:34.374
Carson, whatever's
wrong with you, fix it.

48:34.376 --> 48:36.577
I'm not the only
one who's noticed.

48:36.579 --> 48:37.644
Noticed what?

48:37.646 --> 48:39.113
That you're not here.

48:39.115 --> 48:40.914
You've worked so hard
to build this company.

48:40.916 --> 48:43.851
Now it seems like
you don't even care.

48:43.853 --> 48:45.519
I do care.

48:45.521 --> 48:46.521
Then show it.

48:46.523 --> 48:48.222
You have investors
fighting over you

48:48.224 --> 48:50.057
because you're one of the
most talented people in tech

48:50.059 --> 48:51.458
right now.

48:51.460 --> 48:54.695
And you're amazing to
work for when you show up.

48:54.697 --> 48:56.963
We really need our leader
right now, especially

48:56.965 --> 48:59.166
- when we're hiring new people.
- What?

48:59.168 --> 49:00.601
This is what I'm talking.

49:00.603 --> 49:02.072
You're distracted, Carson!

49:05.708 --> 49:09.744
Does it have to do with
that hit and run accident?

49:09.746 --> 49:11.880
What are you talking about?

49:11.882 --> 49:16.316
The guy who was killed near
Pacific Heights last month?

49:16.318 --> 49:18.485
Jordon Berg was his name, right?

49:18.487 --> 49:20.956
You've been following
the case pretty closely.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.990
Have you been looking
at my browser history?

49:22.992 --> 49:23.659
Maybe.

49:28.030 --> 49:28.966
Fucking crazy.

49:39.842 --> 49:42.010
Hey Mom, what's up?

49:42.012 --> 49:44.378
Are you OK, Carson?

49:44.380 --> 49:45.012
Yeah.

49:45.014 --> 49:47.548
Yeah, I'm fine, Mom.

49:47.550 --> 49:49.316
What do you need?

49:49.318 --> 49:52.653
They
found a new tumor.

49:52.655 --> 49:53.987
He needs another operation.

49:53.989 --> 49:56.624
What?

49:56.626 --> 49:59.526
I'm sorry.
You call me back.

49:59.528 --> 50:00.126
No, no.

50:00.128 --> 50:00.998
I can talk, Mom.

50:07.402 --> 50:09.336
Wait, you said it
was an emergency.

50:09.338 --> 50:10.007
It is.

50:12.342 --> 50:15.043
So the other night I
suggested ice cream.

50:15.045 --> 50:17.545
And you politely declined,
which is a shame,

50:17.547 --> 50:19.213
because it's the
best in the city.

50:19.215 --> 50:22.516
So I brought it to you.

50:22.518 --> 50:23.751
Nice.

50:23.753 --> 50:25.622
- Flavor?
- Vanilla.

50:28.625 --> 50:30.925
Really?

50:30.927 --> 50:33.126
Yeah.

50:33.128 --> 50:35.028
That's my favorite.

50:35.030 --> 50:36.565
- Really?
- I'll get spoons.

50:45.340 --> 50:48.876
Hey, do you want to
help me grade papers?

50:48.878 --> 50:50.380
Um, is that even a question?

50:55.018 --> 50:56.583
These kids are awesome.

50:56.585 --> 50:59.820
- How could you even grade them?
- OK.

50:59.822 --> 51:02.222
This is for you.

51:02.224 --> 51:07.028
So stickers for effort
and a check for lazies.

51:07.030 --> 51:07.798
You'll be able to tell.

51:13.802 --> 51:15.603
I really like your place.

51:15.605 --> 51:18.972
It's very bohemian.

51:18.974 --> 51:21.275
Thanks.

51:21.277 --> 51:23.878
Are you going to miss it?

51:23.880 --> 51:25.648
Yeah, I am.

51:28.918 --> 51:34.789
Well, if it's just a rent
thing, I could help you out.

51:34.791 --> 51:36.460
That's a sweet offer.

53:35.777 --> 53:36.778
Carson?

53:36.780 --> 53:38.780
- Hey.
- Hey.

53:38.782 --> 53:40.180
I didn't know you left.

53:40.182 --> 53:41.581
So sorry I fell asleep.

53:41.583 --> 53:43.184
No, I should've woken you up.

53:43.186 --> 53:44.552
I'm sorry.

53:44.554 --> 53:50.758
I just... there's something
I want to tell you.

53:50.760 --> 53:53.561
What?

53:53.563 --> 53:58.599
I... just had a
lot of fun tonight.

53:58.601 --> 53:59.269
Me too.

54:01.170 --> 54:03.769
Let's do something
this weekend.

54:03.771 --> 54:05.738
OK?

54:05.740 --> 54:06.706
OK.

54:06.708 --> 54:08.644
- Good night, Carson.
- Good night.

54:19.556 --> 54:21.155
Hey.
What are you doing here?

54:21.157 --> 54:23.157
Can I come in?

54:23.159 --> 54:25.191
Sure.

54:25.193 --> 54:27.260
I'm actually on
my way out though.

54:27.262 --> 54:28.695
Where are you going?

54:28.697 --> 54:30.063
Oh, to Marin.

54:30.065 --> 54:31.498
With the girl?

54:31.500 --> 54:33.367
Who is she, anyway?

54:33.369 --> 54:35.702
Where did you meet her?

54:35.704 --> 54:37.003
June, right?

54:37.005 --> 54:38.505
June Ellis?

54:38.507 --> 54:40.374
What is wrong with you?

54:40.376 --> 54:41.275
So it is June.

54:41.277 --> 54:43.110
No, actually, it's not.

54:43.112 --> 54:43.980
And you need to back off.

54:47.215 --> 54:49.282
The way you've
been acting hurts me.

54:49.284 --> 54:51.318
It's like we're
not even friends.

54:51.320 --> 54:53.521
Like I'm a stranger.

54:53.523 --> 54:55.188
I'm not trying to hurt you.

54:55.190 --> 54:57.557
But you are.

54:57.559 --> 54:59.659
We were good together.

54:59.661 --> 55:02.630
We should have never gotten
involved in the first place.

55:02.632 --> 55:04.465
We did.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.967
We had fun
together, but I just

55:05.969 --> 55:09.436
can't see it going anywhere.

55:09.438 --> 55:12.072
You don't mean that.

55:12.074 --> 55:13.842
You haven't been acting
like yourself lately.

55:16.411 --> 55:20.012
I'm going to figure
out what's going on.

55:20.014 --> 55:21.816
I'm going to find out why
you're acting this way,

55:21.818 --> 55:23.416
and I wish that
you could trust me.

55:23.418 --> 55:28.889
But if you don't, I'll
find out on my own.

55:28.891 --> 55:33.494
I am not as stupid
as you think I am.

55:33.496 --> 55:36.365
- Please, just stay out of it.
- Make me.

55:41.637 --> 55:44.237
A private investigator?

55:44.239 --> 55:45.304
Really?

55:45.306 --> 55:46.940
How much is this costing?

55:46.942 --> 55:49.309
It doesn't matter.

55:49.311 --> 55:50.978
I want to find out
who killed my brother.

55:50.980 --> 55:53.914
What is he going to do that
the police haven't already?

55:53.916 --> 55:56.749
Take up local
security cameras.

55:56.751 --> 55:57.985
They can trace a
car into the area.

55:57.987 --> 56:00.554
They can impound it
and test for DNA.

56:00.556 --> 56:02.322
- They've already done that.
- Barely!

56:02.324 --> 56:03.657
They don't have the manpower.

56:03.659 --> 56:06.193
What if he didn't drive
by a place with cameras?

56:06.195 --> 56:06.863
He?

56:09.599 --> 56:12.499
Look, you can do
whatever you want.

56:12.501 --> 56:14.001
I don't want to
talk to this guy.

56:14.003 --> 56:17.271
Well he's going to
want to interview you.

56:17.273 --> 56:19.039
I'm trying to move on.

56:21.409 --> 56:24.878
Without getting
justice for Jordan, huh?

56:24.880 --> 56:28.648
To remind you where
he was that night.

56:28.650 --> 56:31.084
Maybe the PI would be
interested in talking to her.

56:31.086 --> 56:33.586
Maybe he'll want to
interview your new friend.

56:36.858 --> 56:38.458
I have to go.

56:38.460 --> 56:39.927
My friends are waiting.

56:39.929 --> 56:40.797
Friends, huh?

56:43.632 --> 56:45.601
I deserve to know who
killed my brother!

56:54.876 --> 56:55.545
Harper?

57:00.717 --> 57:02.316
Oh hey, there you are.

57:02.318 --> 57:03.316
Hey!

57:03.318 --> 57:04.820
I'm parked over here.

57:35.117 --> 57:35.785
Good morning.

57:54.302 --> 57:55.903
I don't do this enough.

57:55.905 --> 57:57.938
I tend to just get
stuck in the city.

57:57.940 --> 58:00.440
Well, it's easy to do
when you work so much.

58:00.442 --> 58:01.577
My ex was like that.

58:03.978 --> 58:07.514
I never really wanted
this to be my life though.

58:07.516 --> 58:08.548
Why?

58:08.550 --> 58:09.816
You have an amazing reputation.

58:09.818 --> 58:12.219
Yeah, but when I
launched my first app,

58:12.221 --> 58:15.722
I never expected I'd move to
San Francisco and work in tech.

58:15.724 --> 58:18.090
But it just felt like
the right thing to do?

58:18.092 --> 58:20.693
Someone offers you millions of
dollars for an app you created?

58:20.695 --> 58:22.461
You don't really question that.

58:22.463 --> 58:24.632
I just got so caught
up in all of that.

58:24.634 --> 58:26.833
What?
Money?

58:26.835 --> 58:29.369
Spending it on all
the wrong things.

58:29.371 --> 58:31.304
You take care of your family.

58:31.306 --> 58:33.641
I admire that.

58:33.643 --> 58:36.443
I admire you, Harper.

58:36.445 --> 58:37.844
You're real.

58:37.846 --> 58:39.715
You brought me back down
to earth in a lot of ways.

58:46.655 --> 58:48.454
Hi.
You ready to order?

58:48.456 --> 58:50.356
Yeah.

58:50.358 --> 58:52.293
Can I get...

58:52.295 --> 58:54.128
you want to get oysters?

58:54.130 --> 58:54.831
Uh, yeah.

59:06.175 --> 59:07.010
Uh, Carson?

59:18.021 --> 59:19.153
Hey, man.

59:19.155 --> 59:20.621
Marcy is not here.

59:20.623 --> 59:21.588
Didn't you call her?

59:21.590 --> 59:24.325
I don't have her number.

59:24.327 --> 59:26.726
I don't.

59:26.728 --> 59:28.996
Have you heard from Marcy?

59:28.998 --> 59:30.329
I thought she was still sick.

59:30.331 --> 59:31.865
No.

59:31.867 --> 59:33.300
She hasn't called in, and she
isn't answering her phone.

59:33.302 --> 59:34.767
I'm sure she's fine.

59:34.769 --> 59:36.704
Well, we are not fine if
she disappears off the map

59:36.706 --> 59:38.171
eight days before we launch.

59:38.173 --> 59:41.307
Yeah, last I checked
she was at Blue Bottle.

59:41.309 --> 59:42.608
What?

59:42.610 --> 59:44.478
Eric needs the graphics.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.811
Yeah, the site
looks pretty boring.

59:45.813 --> 59:47.380
Well, all her work
is saved on our drive.

59:47.382 --> 59:49.916
Well, she told me several
times that you were too hard

59:49.918 --> 59:51.150
on her and I didn't step in.

59:51.152 --> 59:52.151
What?

59:52.153 --> 59:53.487
Are you joking?

59:53.489 --> 59:55.155
That's it.
We're done.

59:55.157 --> 59:56.255
It is over.

59:56.257 --> 59:58.691
Hire someone else to
finish the graphics.

59:58.693 --> 59:59.693
You were right.

59:59.695 --> 01:00:00.927
We need to hit the launch.

01:00:00.929 --> 01:00:04.097
So do what you need to do.

01:00:04.099 --> 01:00:07.135
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:19.849
Oh, she's back at home now.

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:48.175
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:48.845
How was work?

01:00:53.615 --> 01:00:55.018
Can we get a bottle
of this Tempranillo?

01:00:57.552 --> 01:00:58.719
How was your day?

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:00.454
- Are you serious right now?
- What?

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:02.889
That was such a move.

01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:05.325
Smooth though, right?

01:01:05.327 --> 01:01:06.592
Do you need to get that?

01:01:06.594 --> 01:01:08.894
No.

01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:10.630
We're celebrating.

01:01:10.632 --> 01:01:12.465
We are?

01:01:12.467 --> 01:01:14.568
I'm leaving the tech industry.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:17.170
What, right now?

01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:19.039
I'm going to speak to
every major publication

01:01:19.041 --> 01:01:20.874
to build hype for the launch.

01:01:20.876 --> 01:01:22.742
First, five feature
projects are going to get

01:01:22.744 --> 01:01:24.543
funded on day one, guaranteed.

01:01:24.545 --> 01:01:27.113
And then we'll have another
funding round, at which point

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:29.816
I'm going to step down as CEO,
keep my shares in Epic, bit

01:01:29.818 --> 01:01:33.153
just not be involved
in the day to day.

01:01:33.155 --> 01:01:34.354
Wow, OK.

01:01:34.356 --> 01:01:35.588
Then what?

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:38.925
I don't know.

01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:41.095
Maybe I could help
grow your art programs.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.028
Really?

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:43.396
You'd want to do that?

01:01:43.398 --> 01:01:45.167
Yeah, I think I would.

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:50.403
To new beginnings.

01:01:50.405 --> 01:01:51.240
To new beginnings.

01:01:55.043 --> 01:01:56.842
I've never been up there.

01:01:56.844 --> 01:01:58.179
To wine country?

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.813
Well like, you wouldn't
gone out to see much.

01:01:59.815 --> 01:02:02.014
And until last week, I
hadn't been farther than

01:02:02.016 --> 01:02:03.785
Sausalito since I moved here.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:09.690
My family's got this
place in Geurneville.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:12.025
It's in the Redwoods.
You'd love it.

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:14.695
There's some great
wineries nearby.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:17.197
We should go up there
for the weekend.

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:19.999
It seems like
kind of a big step.

01:02:20.001 --> 01:02:21.735
We used to go there
when I was a kid.

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:25.037
It's got this cool
time capsule vibe.

01:02:25.039 --> 01:02:28.608
I've updated a bit in
the last few years, but...

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:29.511
what do you think?

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:26.162
Beautiful, right?

01:04:40.775 --> 01:04:41.907
June, it's me.

01:04:41.909 --> 01:04:42.809
I just spoke with the PI.

01:04:42.811 --> 01:04:45.545
He's got a new lead.

01:04:45.547 --> 01:04:46.612
I'm on the phone, Ryan!

01:04:46.614 --> 01:04:47.847
OK.

01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:49.782
In case I... June,
it is very important

01:04:49.784 --> 01:04:50.485
that you call me back.

01:04:54.922 --> 01:04:57.590
Are you coming?

01:04:57.592 --> 01:04:59.059
Yeah.

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:02.662
It's so beautiful.

01:05:02.664 --> 01:05:04.930
You want to go for a hike?

01:05:04.932 --> 01:05:07.469
- I'll show you my favorite trail.
- Yeah.

01:05:11.139 --> 01:05:12.040
It's so pretty here.

01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:23.318
Oh.

01:05:28.123 --> 01:05:30.059
Dun-dun-duh-dun-dun-dun.

01:05:33.494 --> 01:05:34.163
OK.

01:05:43.237 --> 01:05:43.804
Ow!

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.072
You OK?

01:05:45.074 --> 01:05:46.740
- Ow!
- Here.

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:47.874
I got you.

01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:49.275
I got you.

01:05:49.277 --> 01:05:50.108
OK.

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.744
I twisted my ankle.

01:05:51.746 --> 01:05:54.613
Let's go back.

01:05:54.615 --> 01:05:55.949
OK.

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:56.950
- I got you.
- All right.

01:05:56.952 --> 01:05:57.653
I'm just going to sit down.

01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:03.055
Here, let me look at it.

01:06:03.057 --> 01:06:04.990
Oh yeah, it looks bad.

01:06:04.992 --> 01:06:05.925
Does it hurt?

01:06:05.927 --> 01:06:06.892
Ow!

01:06:06.894 --> 01:06:08.094
Yeah.

01:06:08.096 --> 01:06:09.431
Let me carry you
back to the cabin.

01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:15.001
You really don't have to
carry me all the way home.

01:06:15.003 --> 01:06:16.536
That's not going to
feel good in a mile.

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:17.604
Don't worry.

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:21.441
You're light as a feather.

01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:22.441
Thank you.

01:06:22.443 --> 01:06:24.209
You're welcome.

01:06:24.211 --> 01:06:25.345
I'm such an idiot.

01:06:25.347 --> 01:06:27.179
- It happens all the time.
- Why?

01:06:27.181 --> 01:06:28.748
Has it happened to you?

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:30.751
Yeah, it happened to me once.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.254
My dad gave me a ride.

01:06:35.123 --> 01:06:37.490
OK, ready?

01:06:37.492 --> 01:06:39.761
What never fails to
liven up the party?

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:46.534
I've got this one.

01:06:48.769 --> 01:06:49.438
OK.

01:06:52.106 --> 01:06:53.305
Should I read it?

01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:54.941
- Or do you want to read it?
- Read it.

01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:55.708
Go ahead.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.309
OK.

01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:59.311
Who never fails to
liven up the party?

01:06:59.313 --> 01:07:01.581
Asians who aren't good at math...

01:07:01.583 --> 01:07:05.684
I'm sorry.

01:07:05.686 --> 01:07:08.688
A tribe of warrior women.

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:12.090
Getting naked and
watching Nickelodeon.

01:07:12.092 --> 01:07:14.026
Don't you do that
with your kids.

01:07:14.028 --> 01:07:15.728
All the time!

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:16.896
It's really appropriate.

01:07:16.898 --> 01:07:20.333
Parents love that.

01:07:20.335 --> 01:07:23.336
A monkey smoking a cigar.

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:27.240
Also something I
do with the kids.

01:07:27.242 --> 01:07:28.876
Heartwarming orphans.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:29.742
Thank you.

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:31.278
I think you win.

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:33.514
How is your ankle feeling?

01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:34.546
It's OK.

01:07:34.548 --> 01:07:37.784
I don't think I need
to ice it anymore.

01:07:37.786 --> 01:07:40.153
Does it hurt?

01:07:40.155 --> 01:07:42.191
Mm, swelling's gone down.

01:07:44.925 --> 01:07:47.994
You want me to kiss it better?

01:07:47.996 --> 01:07:49.461
No.

01:07:49.463 --> 01:07:51.699
- Do you want to kiss it better?
- It's kind of gross.

01:07:57.806 --> 01:07:58.771
I think you'll live.

01:07:58.773 --> 01:07:59.742
I think I'm going to die.

01:08:03.711 --> 01:08:04.545
OK.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.213
One more.

01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:23.796
I still can't believe you
made me my favorite movie.

01:08:23.798 --> 01:08:26.667
- It's actually really sweet.
- Actually?

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:33.207
Do you want some more?

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.783
Open another bottle.

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:00.466
Wow.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:04.403
We're onto our last bottle?

01:09:04.404 --> 01:09:06.207
At least we don't have
to drive home, right?

01:09:20.421 --> 01:09:24.724
I'm really glad you came
out here with me, Harper.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.759
Vanilla?

01:11:39.761 --> 01:11:40.429
No.

01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:44.599
Are you OK?

01:11:51.506 --> 01:11:52.972
Listen, Harper.

01:11:52.974 --> 01:11:54.906
There's something I really
want to talk to you about.

01:11:54.908 --> 01:11:55.576
OK.

01:11:58.613 --> 01:12:00.246
I really care about you.

01:12:00.248 --> 01:12:02.214
You know that, right?

01:12:02.216 --> 01:12:03.549
Ever since we've
known each other,

01:12:03.551 --> 01:12:07.519
I just can't quite shake
how it is that we met.

01:12:07.521 --> 01:12:09.155
I try to write it
off as chance, but...

01:12:09.157 --> 01:12:12.659
- You killed Jordan.
- Harper.

01:12:12.661 --> 01:12:14.027
I know you killed him.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.294
Will you please listen to me?

01:12:15.296 --> 01:12:17.330
You were there where
it happened twice.

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:18.865
I was trying to remember.

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:19.699
I know you did it.

01:12:19.701 --> 01:12:21.032
Would you please listen to me?

01:12:21.034 --> 01:12:22.634
I blacked out.

01:12:22.636 --> 01:12:24.303
When I woke up, there was blood
all over the bumper of my car.

01:12:24.305 --> 01:12:25.972
- I know it was you.
- You don't know that.

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:29.175
You don't know any better
than me or the police.

01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:30.777
You think this
hasn't tortured me?

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.945
You just told me there was
blood on the front of your car!

01:12:32.947 --> 01:12:34.914
You don't think the police
would want to know that?

01:12:34.916 --> 01:12:36.348
I panicked, OK?

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:37.517
I was scared.

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:40.285
I should have turned
myself in, but I

01:12:40.287 --> 01:12:41.553
would lose everything, Harper.

01:12:41.555 --> 01:12:43.555
- Jordan lost everything.
- I know.

01:12:43.557 --> 01:12:45.391
And you killed him!

01:12:45.393 --> 01:12:46.293
You're going to pay.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:47.895
I'll deny I said that.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.534
Where's your phone?

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:56.335
Are you recording this?

01:12:56.337 --> 01:12:57.403
Stay away from me.

01:12:57.405 --> 01:12:58.670
Let me see your phone.

01:12:58.672 --> 01:12:59.805
No.

01:12:59.807 --> 01:13:00.572
Listen, Harper.

01:13:00.574 --> 01:13:01.574
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:13:01.576 --> 01:13:03.742
Just... we can work this out.

01:13:03.744 --> 01:13:05.178
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.478
Harper.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.448
My name is June.

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:11.784
Would you stop?

01:13:11.786 --> 01:13:13.053
No!

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:30.937
Carson.

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:32.104
What did you do?

01:13:32.106 --> 01:13:33.106
I had to.

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:34.476
What the fuck did you know?

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.947
Carson, it's OK.

01:13:42.949 --> 01:13:44.250
OK?

01:13:44.252 --> 01:13:46.652
She's dead!

01:13:46.654 --> 01:13:48.254
That's Jordan Berg's
girlfriend, the guy that

01:13:48.256 --> 01:13:49.321
was killed in the hit and run.

01:13:49.323 --> 01:13:52.325
Do you think I
don't know that?

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.793
I was trying to protect you.

01:13:53.795 --> 01:13:56.830
I told you to stay out of it.

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.129
Fuck!

01:13:58.131 --> 01:13:59.531
You killed her!

01:13:59.533 --> 01:14:02.434
You fucking killed her!

01:14:02.436 --> 01:14:03.469
What are you doing?

01:14:03.471 --> 01:14:06.138
I'm calling for help.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.607
Carson, no.
Wait.

01:14:07.609 --> 01:14:09.645
Stop.
What does this look like to you?

01:14:14.849 --> 01:14:16.316
They'll connect the dots.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:19.385
This whole place
becomes a crime scene.

01:14:19.387 --> 01:14:21.853
If you did kill that guy, and
there's one speck of blood

01:14:21.855 --> 01:14:23.458
on your car, they'll find it.

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:29.762
You need to get out of here.

01:14:29.764 --> 01:14:33.531
No, I'm already an accomplice.

01:14:33.533 --> 01:14:34.603
It's going to be OK.

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:39.208
Come on.
We need to move.

01:14:42.743 --> 01:14:44.179
Let's carry her around the back.

01:14:50.484 --> 01:14:51.985
It's over.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:55.090
We either clean up and
move on or call the police.

01:14:58.894 --> 01:14:59.592
Carson?

01:14:59.594 --> 01:15:00.860
This hit and run thing?

01:15:00.862 --> 01:15:02.228
There's no evidence
it was actually you.

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:03.662
There was blood
all over my car.

01:15:03.664 --> 01:15:05.067
That could have been anything.

01:15:08.703 --> 01:15:10.836
Why are you here?

01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:12.240
You shouldn't
have to ask me that.

01:15:15.943 --> 01:15:19.614
This has been a big distraction,
and you haven't been yourself.

01:15:28.088 --> 01:15:32.458
I'm here for you, for
Hayden, your family,

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:33.860
everyone that believes
in you and who's

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.197
relying on this launch.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.701
Why are you here?

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:07.762
Here.

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.770
I'll bring my car around front.

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:15.162
Are you sure you don't
want me to come over?

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:21.934
I'll see you
tomorrow then, right?

01:17:21.936 --> 01:17:24.504
Yeah.

01:17:24.506 --> 01:17:25.207
Try to get some rest.

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:58.004
Hi, Mom.

01:17:58.006 --> 01:18:00.842
This isn't really a
good time right now.

01:18:01.909 --> 01:18:04.277
Hey, buddy.

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:05.077
Dad?

01:18:05.079 --> 01:18:06.014
How are you?

01:18:07.114 --> 01:18:08.214
Fine, Dad.

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:11.750
It's
good to hear your voice.

01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:14.687
It's good to
hear you too, Dad.

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:18.523
Your mom showed me
your magazine article.

01:18:18.525 --> 01:18:21.628
You look good, Carson.

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:24.231
- You look happy.
- Thanks, Dad.

01:18:27.033 --> 01:18:29.735
Do you have a lady in your life?

01:18:29.737 --> 01:18:31.004
Not right now.

01:18:43.917 --> 01:18:46.885
I'm sorry I haven't
come home in awhile.

01:18:46.887 --> 01:18:49.620
No.
Don't worry about me.

01:18:49.622 --> 01:18:53.358
I'm so proud of you, guy.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:57.229
It takes a lot of courage
to do what you're doing.

01:18:57.231 --> 01:18:59.298
I love you, Dad.

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.769
- I
- love you too, son.

01:20:38.932 --> 01:20:40.999
You look like you've
been hit by a bus.

01:20:41.001 --> 01:20:41.967
Where have you been?

01:20:41.969 --> 01:20:43.369
Would you fuck off, man?

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:43.968
Whoa, man.

01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:45.103
Take it easy.

01:20:45.105 --> 01:20:45.937
No.

01:20:45.939 --> 01:20:47.574
You're always giving me shit.

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:49.942
Carson, just go
talk about this.

01:20:49.944 --> 01:20:52.277
Who the fuck are
all these people?

01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:52.945
New hires.

01:20:52.947 --> 01:20:54.446
I said no new hires.

01:20:54.448 --> 01:20:55.581
You changed her mind.

01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:57.183
I was talking about a
replacement for Marcy,

01:20:57.185 --> 01:20:59.384
not an office full
of goddamn people.

01:20:59.386 --> 01:21:02.655
You're said to do
what I needed to do.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:05.159
- Get them out of here.
- No.

01:21:09.797 --> 01:21:11.429
Listen up, everybody.

01:21:11.431 --> 01:21:13.499
I did not sign off on
your employment contracts,

01:21:13.501 --> 01:21:15.036
and I do not intend to.

01:21:18.738 --> 01:21:20.072
Everything is fine.

01:21:20.074 --> 01:21:22.574
He has low blood sugar,
probably needs a snack.

01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:24.943
Hayden, we're all under
a lot of stress right now.

01:21:24.945 --> 01:21:26.614
Marcy, just get
your shit done.

01:21:40.761 --> 01:21:42.327
Hey, I'm Detective
Reyes, SFPD.

01:21:42.329 --> 01:21:44.929
Is Mr. Carson Griffin here?

01:21:44.931 --> 01:21:47.232
Can I ask what this is about?

01:21:47.234 --> 01:21:49.268
I just need to ask Mr.
Griffin a few questions.

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:50.836
- About what?
- He's not here.

01:21:50.838 --> 01:21:52.137
- Marcy...
- He had a meeting this morning.

01:21:52.139 --> 01:21:54.040
He'll be back in a few hours.

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:55.575
Where was his meeting?

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.276
In the Financial District.

01:21:57.278 --> 01:22:00.012
But his car is parked here.

01:22:00.014 --> 01:22:01.647
We had to prep before he went.

01:22:01.649 --> 01:22:03.715
He decided to take an Uber.

01:22:03.717 --> 01:22:04.916
It's a VC meeting.

01:22:04.918 --> 01:22:07.419
We needed to
discuss some things.

01:22:07.421 --> 01:22:09.955
Well, we have a warrant
to impound his vehicle.

01:22:09.957 --> 01:22:11.326
We're towing it from your lot.

01:22:17.398 --> 01:22:19.031
Please have him
give me a call when

01:22:19.033 --> 01:22:21.000
he gets back from his meeting.

01:22:21.002 --> 01:22:21.967
Of course.

01:22:21.969 --> 01:22:23.038
No problem.

01:22:26.173 --> 01:22:27.973
If I don't hear
from him, I will

01:22:27.975 --> 01:22:29.708
be back with an arrest warrant.

01:22:29.710 --> 01:22:30.843
That won't be necessary.

01:22:30.845 --> 01:22:32.347
Thank you, detective.

01:22:49.829 --> 01:22:50.995
Carson, are you
serious right now?

01:22:50.997 --> 01:22:52.365
Calm down.
You're not helping.

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:53.932
That was obstruction
of justice.

01:22:53.934 --> 01:22:54.933
She could arrest us.

01:22:54.935 --> 01:22:56.403
Hayden!
Conference room.

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:11.987
What is this all about?

01:23:14.588 --> 01:23:18.491
You remember that hit
and run in Pac Heights?

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.558
Yeah I do.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.727
You killed someone?

01:23:21.729 --> 01:23:23.595
I don't know.

01:23:23.597 --> 01:23:25.298
I was blacked out.

01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.200
I woke up, and there was
blood all over my car.

01:23:28.202 --> 01:23:29.334
That's all I know.

01:23:29.336 --> 01:23:31.903
What the hell
is wrong with you?

01:23:31.905 --> 01:23:33.504
You're fucking reckless, man.

01:23:33.506 --> 01:23:35.275
You pay for an Uber if you want
to get fucked up all the time!

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:39.344
We're fucked if they
find any evidence.

01:23:39.346 --> 01:23:41.613
You do know that, right?

01:23:41.615 --> 01:23:44.016
We launch in two days.

01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:46.285
I know.

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:48.620
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:23:48.622 --> 01:23:51.022
What are we going to do?

01:23:51.024 --> 01:23:53.025
I have to turn myself in.

01:23:53.027 --> 01:23:54.125
If I don't cooperate...

01:23:54.127 --> 01:23:57.094
There's no evidence yet.

01:23:57.096 --> 01:23:59.397
You cleaned your
car, right Carson?

01:23:59.399 --> 01:24:00.534
Maybe they won't find anything.

01:24:04.404 --> 01:24:06.041
Do you know where
the accident happened?

01:24:09.176 --> 01:24:11.610
Washington and Octavia.

01:24:11.612 --> 01:24:12.844
And the date?

01:24:12.846 --> 01:24:14.312
Why?

01:24:14.314 --> 01:24:15.682
I can check to see if you
even drove home that way.

01:24:19.753 --> 01:24:21.519
If he didn't drive home
that way, then there's no...

01:24:21.521 --> 01:24:22.689
What do you mean
you can check?

01:24:31.931 --> 01:24:32.897
What is this?

01:24:32.899 --> 01:24:34.132
A side project.

01:24:34.134 --> 01:24:36.134
I'm going to sell it
to the government.

01:24:36.136 --> 01:24:38.070
You've been tracking us?

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.705
You're test subjects.

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:41.772
Is everyone here
breaking the law?

01:24:41.774 --> 01:24:42.842
This is wrong!

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:44.277
Who cares?

01:24:44.279 --> 01:24:46.344
Can you check which way
I went home that night?

01:24:46.346 --> 01:24:47.612
It was early on
in the first beta,

01:24:47.614 --> 01:24:50.415
but the data should
be stored and hidden.

01:24:50.417 --> 01:24:51.683
This is lightweight, OK?

01:24:51.685 --> 01:24:53.318
I should be the least
of your concerns.

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.021
How does it work?

01:24:55.023 --> 01:24:56.487
I send a funny video.

01:24:56.489 --> 01:24:58.824
And while you watch, the
tracker downloads on your phone.

01:24:58.826 --> 01:24:59.892
Easy.

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:02.294
How much do you want for it?

01:25:02.296 --> 01:25:04.729
More than you can bet.
OK.

01:25:04.731 --> 01:25:07.900
Here we go.
Yep.

01:25:07.902 --> 01:25:09.503
- You took Washington.
- Shit.

01:25:19.279 --> 01:25:21.713
We need to delete
all this data.

01:25:21.715 --> 01:25:24.083
Now.

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:25.017
All of it?

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:26.121
Everything about us.

01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:43.934
Where are you going?

01:25:43.936 --> 01:25:45.603
I have to turn myself in.

01:25:45.605 --> 01:25:46.304
Oh my god.

01:25:46.306 --> 01:25:50.275
They took your car, man.

01:25:50.277 --> 01:25:51.843
I'll take you.

01:25:51.845 --> 01:25:53.445
I'll take him.

01:25:53.447 --> 01:25:54.713
You have work to do.

01:25:54.715 --> 01:25:56.147
How can you talk
about work right now?

01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:57.516
Marcy, he's right.

01:25:57.518 --> 01:26:02.153
You don't need to get involved.

01:26:02.155 --> 01:26:03.690
Marcy, I need your keys.

01:26:07.595 --> 01:26:08.262
Let's go.

01:26:37.792 --> 01:26:39.424
I don't understand what
we're supposed to do.

01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:40.893
We're supposed to sit in
fucking Starbucks now?

01:26:40.895 --> 01:26:42.593
Yes, you're going to
sit in Starbucks and...

01:26:42.595 --> 01:26:44.162
- Vince!
- You motherfucker!

01:26:44.164 --> 01:26:45.731
I will fucking kill you!

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:46.531
Vince, stop it!

01:26:46.533 --> 01:26:47.900
You killed my brother!

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:50.436
- You left him to die on the road!
- Stop it!

01:26:50.438 --> 01:26:51.637
Like a fucking animal!

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:52.771
I ought to fucking kill you!

01:26:52.773 --> 01:26:54.238
Stop it!
Stop it!

01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.775
Vince, get out of here!
Right now!

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:57.876
- I hope you fucking rot!
- Get out of here!

01:26:57.878 --> 01:26:58.777
I told you to cool it!

01:26:58.779 --> 01:26:59.647
Get out!

01:27:06.052 --> 01:27:08.254
I'm sorry about
that, Mr. Griffin.

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:09.821
Thank you.

01:27:09.823 --> 01:27:11.022
Thank you for coming.

01:27:11.024 --> 01:27:12.258
I need to ask you
some questions.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.360
Follow me.

01:27:36.283 --> 01:27:38.817
Thank you for cooperating with
our investigation, Mr. Griffin.

01:27:38.819 --> 01:27:40.652
You're free to go.

01:27:40.654 --> 01:27:43.021
What do you mean
I'm free to go?

01:27:43.023 --> 01:27:44.623
It appears we were mistaken.

01:27:44.625 --> 01:27:47.960
Again, I appreciate your willing
cooperation, and I apologize...

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:48.826
Mistaken?

01:27:48.828 --> 01:27:49.961
I was driving drunk.

01:27:49.963 --> 01:27:51.495
I killed Jordan Berg.

01:27:51.497 --> 01:27:54.499
No, you hit something,
but it wasn't Jordan Berg.

01:27:54.501 --> 01:27:56.268
They found traces of
blood on your vehicle,

01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:58.637
but they belong to an animal.

01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:02.307
If we have any more
questions, we'll be in touch.

01:28:02.309 --> 01:28:04.175
I want to confess.

01:28:04.177 --> 01:28:06.413
You can't confess to a
crime that you didn't commit.

01:28:09.115 --> 01:28:11.017
You can't just let me go.

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:15.286
I have no cause to hold
you here, Mr. Griffin.

01:28:15.288 --> 01:28:17.255
Go sign your car out
at the front desk.

01:28:17.257 --> 01:28:18.490
It'll be waiting
for you outside.

01:28:18.492 --> 01:28:19.560
They'll direct you.

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:22.430
You got a dirty conscience.

01:28:28.068 --> 01:28:28.735
Mr. Griffin?

01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:03.803
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:05.070
Don't be.

01:29:05.072 --> 01:29:08.005
No man, I shouldn't have
confronted you like that.

01:29:08.007 --> 01:29:10.075
I let my emotions
get the best of me.

01:29:10.077 --> 01:29:11.308
It's been a hard time.

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:12.779
I understand.

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:19.020
Where is June?

01:29:24.391 --> 01:29:26.223
I don't know who
you're talking about.
