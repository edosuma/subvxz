00:37.004 --> 00:41.575
<i>Middle finger to the judges
because I ain't on trial.</i>

00:41.608 --> 00:43.577
<i>Props Caitlyn Jenner
because there's a lot</i>

00:43.610 --> 00:45.545
<i>of bitch niggas
that's still in denial.</i>

00:48.448 --> 00:50.517
- <i>Yeah, dope on that.</i>
- <i>Uh-hmm.</i>

00:50.550 --> 00:52.319
<i>Put a sponge on that.</i>

00:52.352 --> 00:55.355
<i>They call me boomerang dick
because I come on back.</i>

00:58.592 --> 01:00.627
<i>They going out
for the mom like...</i>

01:00.660 --> 01:02.462
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

01:02.496 --> 01:05.498
<i>I'm going in like
two fingers on prom night.</i>

01:10.004 --> 01:13.074
<i>I get my inspiration
from my folks and ancestors.</i>

01:15.375 --> 01:16.744
<i>Me and my family
stick together</i>

01:16.778 --> 01:18.079
<i>like thighs on pressure.</i>

01:21.481 --> 01:22.482
<i>Bar.</i>

01:27.989 --> 01:29.724
<i>My name is Rachel Cho.</i>

01:29.757 --> 01:31.491
<i>But my friends call me Rache.</i>

01:31.525 --> 01:33.393
<i>Pretty soon,
I'll be graduating from one</i>

01:33.426 --> 01:35.997
<i>of the top universities
in the country.</i>

01:36.030 --> 01:37.697
<i>I have so much
to look forward to.</i>

01:37.732 --> 01:39.366
<i>I'm moving back in
with my parents</i>

01:39.399 --> 01:40.735
<i>and I'll probably start
waiting tables</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:42.402
<i>to help pay off
my student loans.</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.538
<i>Surprisingly,
this is the same plan shared</i>

01:44.571 --> 01:46.606
<i>by much
of my graduating class.</i>

01:46.640 --> 01:48.408
<i>We're having to come
to terms with the fact</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:51.444
<i>that college debt
does not miraculously blossom</i>

01:51.478 --> 01:52.880
<i>into a promising career.</i>

01:52.914 --> 01:55.448
<i>In fact, college debt
and promising careers</i>

01:55.482 --> 01:58.052
<i>have no relation,
whatsoever.</i>

01:58.085 --> 02:00.353
<i>I've maintained a 3.4 GPA</i>

02:00.387 --> 02:01.823
<i>and done everything
I was told to do,</i>

02:01.856 --> 02:03.958
<i>but I don't think
it's working.</i>

02:03.991 --> 02:06.060
<i>You know
what's even more depressing?</i>

02:06.093 --> 02:08.461
<i>Reading the blog of a felon
who's more optimistic</i>

02:08.495 --> 02:10.798
<i>about his future
than I am of mine.</i>

02:10.832 --> 02:12.066
<i>I'm talking about a man
who spent...</i>

02:12.099 --> 02:13.600
- Careful.
- <i>...more years</i>

02:13.633 --> 02:15.602
<i>in confinement
than I've been alive.</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:16.771
This is nuts.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.072
<i>And he has a clear vision</i>

02:18.105 --> 02:19.506
<i>for his future
than anyone I know.</i>

02:19.539 --> 02:20.708
More, more, more, more.

02:20.741 --> 02:21.943
<i>Including my professors.</i>

02:21.976 --> 02:23.510
Stop.

02:23.543 --> 02:24.912
<i>I have to meet this man
face to face.</i>

02:24.946 --> 02:26.781
Got it.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.149
<i>My final film assignment</i>

02:28.182 --> 02:29.851
<i>is a 10-minute short</i>

02:29.884 --> 02:31.719
<i>which explores the contrast
between my bleak...</i>

02:31.752 --> 02:33.420
Hello?

02:33.453 --> 02:35.790
<i>...uncertainty
as a soon-to-be college grad</i>

02:35.823 --> 02:38.860
and the adrenalizing
confidence of a convict

02:38.893 --> 02:40.761
soon to be paroled from here.

02:40.795 --> 02:44.431
The Miami-Daye
Correctional Facility.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.666
<i>The optimism
in your blog is...</i>

02:46.701 --> 02:48.903
Hotter than Sriracha.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.637
That works too.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.606
It's actually what inspired me
to interview you.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.141
If that shit inspired you,

02:54.175 --> 02:57.111
I got this seminar called,
"What You See Is What You Saw."

02:57.144 --> 02:58.980
That shit go hard
in the paint.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.147
Can you perform some of it?

03:00.181 --> 03:01.148
Maybe I can put it
in my short.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.817
I can a little bit.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.551
I can make you a little...
hot little 10-minute set.

03:04.584 --> 03:06.020
Okay.
Here go a little piece I just...

03:06.053 --> 03:07.121
I just finished off.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.824
But it's a little story of hope.

03:09.857 --> 03:13.493
I once knew this kid,
10-year-old boy,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.130
and his parents
named him Monica.

03:16.163 --> 03:19.033
They thought naming him Monica
would help build character.

03:19.066 --> 03:23.905
And they spelled the shit
M-Y-N-I-G-G-A, Monica.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.107
All right, TJ.
Sit the fuck down.

03:26.140 --> 03:28.943
Oh, I asked him to perform
a little bit of his seminar.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.443
Yes, ma'am.
And I'm telling him to do it

03:30.477 --> 03:31.879
with his ass in the seat.

03:31.913 --> 03:33.680
Make me say it again, there's
not gonna be an interview.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.482
Actually, come tomorrow
and collect that Gate Money,

03:35.515 --> 03:36.984
- so you know.
- What's "Gate Money?"

03:37.018 --> 03:38.719
You give like a hundred
dollars in a bus ticket.

03:38.753 --> 03:40.453
You know what I'm saying?
When you get out of prison,

03:40.487 --> 03:41.722
this is the way
if you want, you know.

03:41.756 --> 03:42.957
We can do this interview
in the fresh air

03:42.990 --> 03:44.191
while I smoke my Newport.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.160
- What did I say, TJ?
- I'm sitting down.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.062
All right.
I'm sitting down.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.764
- Come on.
- I was sitting down.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.531
- Roll over.
- That's what I was doing.

03:51.564 --> 03:52.833
Nigga, hold up.
Look, wait, wait, hold up.

03:52.867 --> 03:55.036
Are you serious? Excuse me.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.038
Turn over, TJ.
Turn over.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.538
You're getting
this shit on camera?

03:58.571 --> 04:00.074
You're getting
this shit on camera?

04:00.107 --> 04:01.809
- You see how they do?
- Why are you trying

04:01.842 --> 04:03.476
to fuck this up, TJ?
You're fucking it up.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.012
- Okay.
- What is your problem?

04:05.046 --> 04:06.513
We have a permit to film this.

04:06.546 --> 04:07.815
Do you have
a permit to film me?

04:07.848 --> 04:09.150
I do not think so.
Shut that thing off.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.517
Serious?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.552
- See how they do?
- You got him.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.088
Enjoy.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.222
- Hey.
- Prime time TV.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.826
I appreciate you sticking up
for a nigga, you know, but...

04:18.858 --> 04:20.660
this is what they do.

04:20.694 --> 04:23.230
You know, they'll come tomorrow,
TJ on their skip duty. Heard me?

04:23.264 --> 04:26.100
Shouldn't Officer Layne
be reported for kicking you?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.835
What about the next inmate?

04:27.868 --> 04:28.869
What about him?

04:30.004 --> 04:31.906
Let's say I file a complaint,
it make it all the way up

04:31.939 --> 04:33.174
to the Inspector
General's office.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.943
Still it's my word
against white folks.

04:35.977 --> 04:37.544
First time in my life,
I can see the light

04:37.577 --> 04:38.946
at the end
of the fucking tunnel.

04:38.980 --> 04:41.614
It ain't just some nigga burning
a cigarette in the dark.

04:41.648 --> 04:42.615
You heard me?

04:42.649 --> 04:43.784
So, I got to decide.

04:43.818 --> 04:46.087
Do I want justice
or do I want freedom?

04:46.120 --> 04:49.223
- Why not both?
- Both?

04:49.256 --> 04:51.658
You're a vegan
or something, huh?

04:51.691 --> 04:52.960
Well, she wild as shit.

04:52.994 --> 04:54.795
<i>People always seem amazed
with the fact</i>

04:54.829 --> 04:56.297
<i>that I could be so, you know,</i>

04:56.330 --> 04:58.733
I could be such a visionary
from behind these walls.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.801
<i>Anything is possible,
understand? You can do it.</i>

05:00.835 --> 05:02.136
It's just like...
it's like prison pussy,

05:02.169 --> 05:05.206
you know, you just got
to use your imagination.

05:05.239 --> 05:07.174
You need to get good to you.

05:07.208 --> 05:08.675
Niggas just think
you just walk up

05:08.709 --> 05:10.911
out the prison like you do
in a movie.

05:10.945 --> 05:12.645
<i>And I got a lot to prove, man.</i>

05:12.679 --> 05:14.215
A lot to prove.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.083
<i>You know, because there's
a lot of folks out there,</i>

05:16.117 --> 05:18.019
they think I ain't shit
but a runaway hamster, you know,

05:18.052 --> 05:20.788
because the nigga keep
getting put back in that cage.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.290
When I get up out this bitch,
I'ma be like stripper glitter.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.192
Nigga, I'm rubbing off
on everybody.

05:25.226 --> 05:26.160
Heard me?

05:27.028 --> 05:28.996
Two minutes.

05:32.199 --> 05:36.303
I heard you put you
on your bathtub

05:38.172 --> 05:40.141
I got to do a last minute review
on my pre-release plan

05:40.174 --> 05:42.309
to make sure a nigga
capitalizing on all the options

05:42.343 --> 05:44.111
available to me
when I'm on the outside.

05:44.145 --> 05:45.578
This way...

05:45.612 --> 05:47.148
Uh, no. Cameras
are not allowed in here.

05:47.181 --> 05:49.183
But, Ms. Judy, it's the
documentary starring me.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.886
So, obviously, the cameras
got to go where I go.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.220
Last I checked,
you're the subject

05:53.254 --> 05:55.222
of a 10-minute student film
not The Green Mile.

05:55.256 --> 05:56.991
- Okay. Can they just...
- Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, no.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.625
Can they... can they film
a nigga from the hallway?

06:00.227 --> 06:01.095
Come here.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.330
Don't ever use that word
in front of me again.

06:03.364 --> 06:06.033
- Yes, Ms. Judy.
- Okay. Back up.

06:07.234 --> 06:09.203
You wanna get him down?

06:09.236 --> 06:11.005
- Thank you.
- Wait, wait.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.107
Y'all just got to lay
in the cut, okay?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.909
Get one camera here

06:14.942 --> 06:17.144
then you get another camera here
like this, right?

06:17.178 --> 06:18.712
And be phantom
because it's like

06:18.746 --> 06:20.748
that "catch the predator shit."
Heard me?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.618
Hmm.
You dye your hair?

06:25.652 --> 06:26.653
- No.
- No.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.826
Mr. Jackson, you haven't filed
for any housing aid.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.627
You don't qualify
for any child tax credits

06:34.661 --> 06:36.063
or disability related benefits.

06:36.097 --> 06:37.998
What are your plans
for employment?

06:38.032 --> 06:40.101
Oh, I'ma just... I'm really
just gonna start my company,

06:40.134 --> 06:42.069
follow my calling
being a life coach,

06:42.103 --> 06:44.805
motivational speaker,
well-renowned.

06:44.839 --> 06:45.873
Uh, okay.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.075
Have you contacted
your family,

06:48.109 --> 06:49.343
arranged for room and board

06:49.376 --> 06:50.845
or would you like us
to help you with that?

06:50.878 --> 06:52.246
Y'all kidding, right?

06:52.279 --> 06:54.782
My family probably waiting
for me outside right now.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.417
Okay. When it comes
to the Jackson family,

06:56.450 --> 06:58.252
I'm Michael, okay?

06:58.285 --> 07:00.721
They're probably gonna throw
a big old block party for me.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.056
Supposed to be a secret,
but you know how it is,

07:02.089 --> 07:03.190
- hood niggas talk.
- Language.

07:03.224 --> 07:04.758
Copy that. I'ma get me

07:04.792 --> 07:06.060
a cool little spot
in The Wood.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.194
Give me a sec.

07:07.228 --> 07:08.929
Uh, Hollywood, Florida.

07:08.963 --> 07:11.232
Yeah, you know,
caught me a whip.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.399
- And that's?
- Vehicle.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.801
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.769
I am a CLS
for the department.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.939
Uh, Communications
and Linguistics Specialist.

07:18.973 --> 07:20.407
One of the things
we discovered

07:20.441 --> 07:22.276
was a major disconnect

07:22.309 --> 07:26.347
between inmates and COs,
uh, Corrections Officers,

07:26.380 --> 07:28.849
primarily due
to the street vernacular

07:28.883 --> 07:30.317
that is used by inmates
in prison.

07:30.351 --> 07:33.454
So, I was a natural fit
to step in and to translate.

07:33.487 --> 07:35.688
It's gonna be like they throw
a Scar Mitzvah for me.

07:35.723 --> 07:36.857
You know,
it's gonna be like that.

07:36.891 --> 07:38.392
Uh, it's the party you throw

07:38.425 --> 07:41.729
when you sue the state
for police brutality and win.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.265
- Yeah. Right. So, then...
- Hang on.

07:44.298 --> 07:45.733
The kids are... could you...

07:45.766 --> 07:47.334
<i>Uh, my job is to make sure</i>

07:47.368 --> 07:48.936
that each inmate's transition

07:48.969 --> 07:53.407
back to civilian life
is smooth and practical.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.810
And usually they move from here
to a "halfway home" to help them

07:56.844 --> 07:59.880
with that transition back
to civilian life.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.849
But, um, Mr. Jackson

08:01.882 --> 08:04.785
opted to spend
his halfway time

08:04.818 --> 08:05.886
here at the prison.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.822
I have never seen him
get a visitor.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.424
<i>Uh, he hasn't had
any phone calls.</i>

08:10.457 --> 08:12.426
He maybe had one letter

08:12.459 --> 08:14.895
and that's what prompts
my concerns.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.031
<i>Without a community
to lean on,</i>

08:17.064 --> 08:18.899
<i>prisoners usually end up</i>

08:18.933 --> 08:22.303
back here with us...

08:23.337 --> 08:24.805
for another round.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.808
Most y'all know me as TJ.
Heard me?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.944
But my government name
is Tijuana Jackson.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.145
Life coach with a goon-hand,

08:31.178 --> 08:33.414
motivational speaker,
real nigga shit.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.416
Now look, I know Ms. Judy
usually don't like this,

08:35.448 --> 08:36.817
but maybe since
it's my last day...

08:36.850 --> 08:38.085
Ah, don't even try it.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.788
- Nope.
- Okay. Uh, just checking.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.256
He knows better.
He's just, uh...

08:42.289 --> 08:45.226
showboating for the cameras.

08:45.259 --> 08:49.430
Mr. Jackson is one
of our more colorful inmates.

08:49.463 --> 08:51.165
<i>He fancies himself
a life coach</i>

08:51.198 --> 08:53.534
<i>and a lot of the inmates
do look up to him.</i>

08:53.567 --> 08:56.303
He has helped me
just talk some sense

08:56.337 --> 08:57.871
into some of these jits.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.241
Who said
we can want

09:00.274 --> 09:02.009
- Don't make me get loud.
- Some bullshit.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.078
I got this sentence,
you know,

09:04.111 --> 09:05.879
for siphoning gas
out a school bus.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.982
The shit was really like
a little misdemeanor, you know.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.217
But it escalated to a felony,
you know what I'm saying?

09:10.251 --> 09:12.019
Because nigga's
smoking a cigarette

09:12.052 --> 09:14.855
therefore endangering
the lives of the kids

09:14.888 --> 09:16.557
that were still on the bus,

09:16.590 --> 09:18.259
short bus, whatever it was.

09:20.127 --> 09:21.328
<i>You know, with me and TJ,</i>

09:21.362 --> 09:23.964
<i>we grew up together,
you know?</i>

09:23.998 --> 09:28.102
Roach, Judy boss,
Judy boss, your boy on TV.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.403
<i>Don't mine he's small.</i>

09:29.436 --> 09:31.905
You know,
he thinks big, very big.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.841
<i>He's good people.
He's good people.</i>

09:33.874 --> 09:37.378
I got my sentence
reduced to 10 months,

09:37.411 --> 09:40.080
but statistics say
that I'm likely to return

09:40.114 --> 09:42.349
to this slave track, okay?

09:42.383 --> 09:44.151
Let me tell you something.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.086
I ain't coming back.
Y'all could have that.

09:46.120 --> 09:47.087
Product of the state.

09:47.121 --> 09:48.589
So ill I bleed HAZMAT.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.190
Fucking with a Beast.

09:50.224 --> 09:53.260
Savage. Beast.

09:53.294 --> 09:56.563
Beast. That Beast.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.232
Y'all don't know that one yet.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.901
You're gonna know that shit
when my mixtape drop.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.537
Better believe that shit.
Heard me?

10:03.570 --> 10:08.008
The PPRP is 100%
volunteer-based.

10:08.042 --> 10:10.844
Some programs rescue
any species of animal.

10:10.878 --> 10:14.181
<i>But this one here
is a dog's only rescue.</i>

10:14.214 --> 10:15.916
What's good, Chance?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.217
Huh?

10:17.251 --> 10:19.053
I named her Chance
because it's very rare

10:19.086 --> 10:20.487
a black man
gets a seventh chance.

10:20.521 --> 10:22.022
Did you say
a second chance?

10:22.056 --> 10:24.158
No, I said a seventh chance.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.526
Come on, girl. Come on.

10:25.559 --> 10:26.994
She's smarter than
my ex-girlfriend,

10:27.027 --> 10:28.362
I tell you that.
Raise yourself.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.097
Show me that Mayweather.
You want this, huh?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.131
Show me that Mayweather.

10:31.165 --> 10:32.866
Stop and freeze,
stop and freeze.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.967
Huh, what you got?

10:34.001 --> 10:35.235
You got heat on you, huh?

10:35.269 --> 10:37.004
You holding?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.872
Good girl.
Good girl. Good girl.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.341
Come here.
Come here, Chance.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.276
He's done
an exceptional job with her.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.644
Not always, man.
I done...

10:43.677 --> 10:44.945
I done stepped on her tail.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.580
I done stepped on her paw.

10:46.613 --> 10:49.917
I done all kind of crazy.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.285
I'm not incriminating
myself, am I?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.653
No, you're fine.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.388
But I've done
all kind of stuff to her.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.523
Heard me? She ain't...
she ain't never had no grudge.

10:56.557 --> 11:00.060
She just let that shit go.
Now, she about to be free.

11:00.094 --> 11:01.328
Meanwhile,
there's niggas in here

11:01.362 --> 11:03.163
getting shanked
over correctional cake.

11:03.197 --> 11:04.398
What's correctional cake?

11:04.431 --> 11:08.302
Oh, it's cake
made from crushed Oreos,

11:08.335 --> 11:11.939
peanut butter, and M&Ms.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.974
But as I was saying
before she interrupted

11:14.007 --> 11:17.578
my fucking monologue...

11:17.611 --> 11:20.013
we don't hold grudges,
do we, Chance?

11:20.047 --> 11:21.415
Grudges hold us, huh?

11:22.449 --> 11:24.351
You fucking seen me.

11:24.385 --> 11:26.420
Open the fucking...
I see you.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.955
I know you fucking seen me.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.190
Get off me.
Get the fuck off me.

11:30.224 --> 11:32.659
Get off, nigga.
Get the fuck.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.428
- It's beyond my control.
- It's bullshit.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.598
I asked them. I asked them.
I asked them when I got my ERD.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.032
Why y'all ain't tell me then?

11:39.066 --> 11:40.968
Because I thought
it was gonna work out.

11:44.438 --> 11:47.174
I always talk about closure.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.677
I tried really hard.

11:50.712 --> 11:52.346
He deserves Chance,

11:52.379 --> 11:54.615
but the Prison Pet
Rescue Program

11:54.648 --> 11:57.017
doesn't service civilians

11:57.050 --> 11:59.953
and they would not
make an exception

11:59.987 --> 12:02.189
<i>for Mr. Jackson
even though I asked.</i>

12:02.222 --> 12:04.358
<i>Prison is a bitch.</i>

12:04.391 --> 12:05.959
But they won't let you take
that bitch with you.

12:05.993 --> 12:07.094
Don't let her
chew her hot spots.

12:07.127 --> 12:08.162
- Heard me?
- Uh-hmm.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.229
- Okay?
- Uh-hmm.

12:09.263 --> 12:10.964
And don't breed her.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.566
I don't want them other mutts
shoving their cock off

12:12.599 --> 12:14.435
in my dog like that.
She ain't no Instagram ho.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.003
Don't worry as such, bro.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.337
It's Upgrade
you're dealing with, you know.

12:17.371 --> 12:18.740
I want you
to give her like half

12:18.773 --> 12:20.040
a Nutraloaf in the morning.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.508
You get them out
the chow hall.

12:21.542 --> 12:22.643
give her
the other half at night.

12:22.676 --> 12:24.678
- Uh-hmm.
- You dig?

12:24.712 --> 12:26.180
And you got to give
a whole lot of water

12:26.213 --> 12:27.648
in between meals,
'cause that Nutraloaf

12:27.681 --> 12:30.752
- will shank your asshole.
- Brethren, it's family.

12:30.785 --> 12:33.086
This is like my little sister
with blood.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.022
Anything interfere with us,
bleed.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.356
Bleed.
Nigga, you can't...

12:36.390 --> 12:39.293
nigga, if you do...
if you do that, nigga,

12:39.326 --> 12:41.195
you're gonna end up in IMU.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.463
If you end up in IMU,

12:42.496 --> 12:43.765
she's gonna end up
in that bean slot.

12:43.798 --> 12:46.233
Heard me?
Look, Upgrade, Upgrade.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.534
No, no, no, no.
Listen, man.

12:47.568 --> 12:49.069
You got to treat her life...

12:49.102 --> 12:50.504
you got to treat her life
like it's your life.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.706
You do that,
you ain't gonna believe

12:51.739 --> 12:53.173
what you get out of it, man.

12:53.207 --> 12:56.109
Nigga, nigga,
I'm about to be free, nigga.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.678
And when I catch you
on the outside,

12:57.712 --> 12:59.279
- I got work for you.
- Good.

12:59.313 --> 13:00.447
- Okay?
- Uh-hmm.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.616
Full-time life coach
assistant, okay?

13:02.649 --> 13:04.117
- Full salary.
- Okay.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.620
- Benefits with it, okay?
- Got you.

13:06.653 --> 13:09.256
And all the roti
you can eat, you dig?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.524
You can't get this
kind of respect

13:10.557 --> 13:12.392
unless you're a chief.
Heard me?

13:12.426 --> 13:14.261
I fucked you
in your ass good, didn't I, TJ?

13:14.294 --> 13:16.497
You bitch. Come on.
Tell me you like it.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.098
Can you all edit that out?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.480
<i>♪ Woo ♪</i>

13:46.326 --> 13:48.328
<i>♪ Woo ♪</i>

14:19.259 --> 14:22.195
They probably caught up in that
Fort Lauderdale traffic.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.075
They'd be here.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.276
So, should we just conduct
the interview here?

15:09.309 --> 15:10.677
Is that okay?

15:10.712 --> 15:12.880
I thought you all wanted
to get my family in?

15:12.914 --> 15:16.683
Had a whole family
in the interview?

15:16.718 --> 15:18.920
Mr. Jackson,
this is my cameraman, Justin.

15:18.953 --> 15:20.420
What's up, homie?

15:20.454 --> 15:22.790
Hey, you fuck black guys?

15:28.195 --> 15:31.833
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hold up.

15:31.866 --> 15:35.235
Hey, I'll tell you
all something.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.272
Can a nigga catch a ride
with you all?

15:39.306 --> 15:41.909
Well, it's getting kind of late
and we have to drive all...

15:41.943 --> 15:45.312
Shotgun, homie.

15:45.345 --> 15:46.948
I called it, shotgun.

15:46.981 --> 15:49.616
They sent me this shit
right before I got popped.

15:49.650 --> 15:51.518
It said,
"Dear Mr. Tijuana Jackson,

15:51.551 --> 15:54.789
Toastmasters reality show
is seeking contestants

15:54.822 --> 15:57.224
to participate
in our nationally televised

15:57.257 --> 15:58.893
speakers competition program.

15:58.926 --> 16:01.461
They must... they must have
found me from my blog.

16:01.495 --> 16:02.830
I thought inmates
weren't allowed

16:02.864 --> 16:04.264
to have computers in prison?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.465
They're not.

16:05.499 --> 16:07.567
So, how did you maintain a blog?

16:07.601 --> 16:08.970
Hey.

16:09.003 --> 16:11.505
Hey, fam, is she gonna talk
through the whole thing?

16:11.538 --> 16:13.206
It ain't
but 10 minutes long, huh?

16:13.240 --> 16:15.442
Do you mind
not smoking in my car, please?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.978
- Thank you.
- It's menthol.

16:17.011 --> 16:20.380
Take a right after the light.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.649
Right here, take a right here
because this... yeah.

16:22.683 --> 16:23.918
This Toastmaster reality show

16:23.951 --> 16:25.619
was like shark tank
of public speakers.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.421
They put a nigga on the map.
Heard me?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.523
Hey, black cop.
What up, nigga?

16:29.556 --> 16:30.892
Oh, yeah.

16:30.925 --> 16:32.693
That's the homie.

16:32.727 --> 16:35.228
Built this whole empire
collecting them cans.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.932
I'm gonna build my empire off
this Toastmaster thing.

16:37.965 --> 16:40.233
That's how I'm gonna get
my motivational speaking career

16:40.267 --> 16:41.869
off the block
and then you can see

16:41.903 --> 16:45.940
by this dope head architecture
this is Hollywood, Florida.

16:45.973 --> 16:47.775
I told you all they was
gonna be waiting for me.

16:47.809 --> 16:49.509
Now you can get your interview.

16:49.543 --> 16:51.244
Hold my shit.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.279
What up, momma?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.748
What you do now, Junior?

16:53.781 --> 16:55.582
Nothing. They're just here
to film my homecoming party.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.018
Party?

16:57.051 --> 16:58.786
I'm supposed to celebrate you
getting out of jail

16:58.820 --> 16:59.954
and let the whole neighborhood

16:59.987 --> 17:01.688
- know my son is a felon?
- Momma.

17:01.723 --> 17:03.024
They already know that, Momma.

17:03.057 --> 17:04.290
Excuse me.

17:04.324 --> 17:05.392
If it ain't no party,
why is she...

17:05.425 --> 17:06.358
why is she dressed like that?

17:06.393 --> 17:07.594
Dressed like what?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.463
Like you
Martha Stewart's house, nigga.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.431
Why are you dressed
like a homeless fam?

17:11.464 --> 17:12.834
Junior,
why are all these folks

17:12.867 --> 17:14.367
following you around
with these cameras?

17:14.401 --> 17:15.770
Momma, they're making
a movie about me.

17:15.803 --> 17:17.839
That's Rachel
and that's her white friend.

17:17.872 --> 17:19.707
Y'all making
a movie about Junior?

17:19.741 --> 17:21.508
Just a short movie, ma'am.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.643
- Goddamn, these mosquitoes.
- Watch your mouth, boy.

17:23.676 --> 17:24.878
Copy that.
What's wrong with her?

17:24.912 --> 17:26.579
Late for work.
Lil Eric out of control,

17:26.613 --> 17:27.982
can't tell him nothing.
Well, let me talk to him.

17:28.015 --> 17:29.483
- Where he at?
- I don't know.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.818
He out there running
with them hoodlums.

17:30.852 --> 17:32.053
He running with... Sharea.

17:32.086 --> 17:33.788
- Where my nephew?
- Leave me alone.

17:33.821 --> 17:34.922
I bet you I find him.

17:34.956 --> 17:36.656
What'd you all do
with my BB gun?

17:36.690 --> 17:38.558
- I don't need your help.
- Junior. Stop.

17:38.592 --> 17:39.927
You just got out of jail.

17:40.862 --> 17:41.863
Where is it?

17:44.397 --> 17:47.969
- Uh-uh. Come on now.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:48.002 --> 17:49.904
Goddamn, Sharea.
This shit cost me $4.

17:49.937 --> 17:51.005
Yeah, but you just
sit your slow ass down.

17:51.038 --> 17:53.540
You just got out of jail.
I'm about to call Big Eric.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.474
- Oh, y'all on speaking terms?
- Not really.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.743
Her baby daddy,
he don't give a shit

17:55.777 --> 17:57.879
about his own son, it's to claim
little nigga on his income tax.

17:57.912 --> 17:59.513
Should have named
little nigga W-2, heard me?

17:59.546 --> 18:00.915
If she... I go away,
do a little bid.

18:00.948 --> 18:02.582
She can't look
after her own son. Know why?

18:02.616 --> 18:04.018
'Cause she too busy
trying to get that eggplant

18:04.051 --> 18:05.685
- off the Internet.
- I know you did not

18:05.720 --> 18:06.888
- just say that.
- I said what I said.

18:06.921 --> 18:08.388
Okay. Let me tell you
all something.

18:08.421 --> 18:09.957
Don't get this thing
twisted, okay?

18:09.991 --> 18:11.558
I'm the only person
in this family with a degree.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.426
When I was pregnant,
I went back to school

18:13.460 --> 18:15.328
- to get my bachelors, okay?
- Okay. Ask her who paid for it.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.098
Now meanwhile, this fool
right here in other news,

18:17.131 --> 18:19.399
he done went backwards,
State pen University,

18:19.432 --> 18:20.835
State pen University.

18:20.868 --> 18:22.770
Ask her... ask her
who paid for the damn degree.

18:22.804 --> 18:24.437
- It don't matter.
- TJ.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.940
It don't...
let me tell you all something.

18:25.973 --> 18:27.507
TJ.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.111
Sit down.

18:30.144 --> 18:31.846
And you stop too.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.098
Excuse me. Can we go now?

18:51.132 --> 18:53.034
Come on, baby.

18:53.067 --> 18:54.936
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.015
Watch out, hon.

19:51.125 --> 19:53.094
That's Rukus, he's a cool,
little motherfucker.

19:53.127 --> 19:55.695
He don't like black people
but he think I'm Dominican.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.198
Go back inside
and get you some juice.

19:57.231 --> 19:59.200
I'll be back.

19:59.233 --> 20:00.801
My children, I don't know

20:00.835 --> 20:02.535
what I'm gonna do with them.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.205
Momma, you know
can't nobody tell TJ nothing.

20:04.238 --> 20:06.140
I taught you all
better than that.

20:06.173 --> 20:08.976
You all is plural.
Don't include me in his mess.

20:09.010 --> 20:11.712
Are you serious?
No. Why?

20:11.746 --> 20:12.847
Because I asked for somebody

20:12.880 --> 20:14.148
to cover my shift
for 20 minutes?

20:14.181 --> 20:15.950
All he had to do was say,
"No, ma'am."

20:15.983 --> 20:18.052
Sharea? You ain't gonna offer
the white people no juice?

20:18.085 --> 20:19.619
Oh, get the hell
off this, boy.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.122
Hey, we're gonna finish
this conversation

20:21.155 --> 20:22.957
- before you go home. Hear me?
- We don't have a home.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.158
What you mean?

20:24.191 --> 20:25.692
Quit acting like
it's your business.

20:25.726 --> 20:28.729
- Quit acting like you care.
- I don't care?

20:28.763 --> 20:30.497
You got me twisted
with Big Eric, boy.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.767
Have I ever one time...
have I ever one time

20:32.800 --> 20:33.768
missed one of your debates?

20:33.801 --> 20:35.036
Yes.

20:35.069 --> 20:36.938
- Because I was in jail, right?
- Whatever.

20:36.971 --> 20:38.638
Well, nigga, don't act like
it ain't a good excuse.

20:38.672 --> 20:40.507
Anytime I was out of jail,
I was at this nigga's debates.

20:40.540 --> 20:41.742
So, what're you gonna do now,

20:41.776 --> 20:43.144
play good uncle
for a couple of weeks

20:43.177 --> 20:45.079
- then go back to jail?
- That's what you want?

20:45.112 --> 20:47.181
No, but that's what
always happens.

20:47.214 --> 20:50.483
Lil Eric,
get your ass in this house.

20:50.517 --> 20:53.620
Can I...

20:53.653 --> 20:55.022
I can't even talk
to my damn nephew.

20:55.056 --> 20:56.690
I'll tell you, man.
We got this thing in prison

20:56.724 --> 20:57.992
called peek-a-boos, right?

20:58.025 --> 20:59.559
And what it is,
is when you really wanna

20:59.592 --> 21:01.128
humiliate a motherfucker,
you push your dick

21:01.162 --> 21:03.530
between their legs,
make them blow you from the back

21:03.563 --> 21:05.665
this way when you cum
you can shit in his face.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.202
I tell you,
that shit is humiliating.

21:08.235 --> 21:09.737
Hey. Oh.

21:09.770 --> 21:12.139
Momma said you need those
and this is from me.

21:12.173 --> 21:13.741
You get these
from the Indian Reservation?

21:13.774 --> 21:15.508
Yeah. Why?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.144
So, you're gonna go all the way
to the damn Reservation

21:17.178 --> 21:18.846
and you can't come scoop
a nigga from the joint?

21:18.879 --> 21:20.181
In what, nigga?

21:20.214 --> 21:21.983
I looked the fucking
Underground Railroad to you?

21:22.016 --> 21:23.017
What happened to your car?

21:23.050 --> 21:24.617
Mind your business.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.187
- Where did you find Lil Eric?
- Mind your business.

21:26.220 --> 21:27.587
It ain't a man's business
to speak

21:27.620 --> 21:28.688
on another man's business.

21:28.723 --> 21:29.824
Well, you ain't much of a man.

21:29.857 --> 21:30.958
So, we don't have that problem.

21:30.992 --> 21:32.259
At least I ain't no snitch.

21:32.293 --> 21:33.894
Okay. See.

21:33.928 --> 21:35.763
this is exactly why he ain't
gonna get no gold seal.

21:35.796 --> 21:36.964
This motherfucker
got his freedom,

21:36.998 --> 21:38.565
but still operating
on the outside

21:38.598 --> 21:40.034
like his ass is in prison.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.669
Black fucker.

21:47.241 --> 21:49.076
Welcome home.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.078
- <i>What you watching?</i>
- <i>Fight.</i>

21:51.112 --> 21:52.679
And you got school
in the morning?

21:52.713 --> 21:56.150
- No. School closed out.
- What, teachers on strike?

21:56.183 --> 21:58.719
Sewage backed up
and flooded the first floor.

21:58.753 --> 22:00.888
Started to smell
like grandma's bed pan.

22:00.921 --> 22:02.156
I thought they fixed
that shit last year?

22:02.189 --> 22:04.025
Uh-uh.
They just moved the gym

22:04.058 --> 22:06.626
to the second floor
and served lunch outside.

22:06.659 --> 22:07.995
But everybody
started getting sick,

22:08.029 --> 22:10.264
so the health department
shut it down

22:10.297 --> 22:12.333
after a few people died.

22:12.366 --> 22:14.601
Why you ain't transfer
to a different school then?

22:14.634 --> 22:18.906
Uh-hmm. We tried,
but there wasn't enough room.

22:18.939 --> 22:22.675
Hmm, I'm cool with it though.

22:22.710 --> 22:24.011
Florida's finest.

22:24.045 --> 22:25.578
God, I didn't know
you're gonna bring

22:25.612 --> 22:26.914
- these cameras with you.
- This is my room.

22:26.947 --> 22:28.215
Not anymore.
Momma said I could use it.

22:28.249 --> 22:29.616
Now, get out.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.085
Where am I supposed
to sleep, Sharea?

22:31.118 --> 22:32.753
Sleep? I'm still waiting on you
to wake the fuck up.

22:32.787 --> 22:33.988
Bitch, I've asked you nicely.

22:34.021 --> 22:35.655
Get the fuck back.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.291
You know Lil Eric out there
sleeping on the sofa, huh?

22:37.324 --> 22:38.826
I know. He don't like
to sleep in here.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.861
- Goddamn.
- Why not?

22:40.895 --> 22:43.931
You just don't want me
to shit in peace, do you?

22:43.964 --> 22:46.133
We got the whole room smelling
like Michael Moore asshole.

22:46.167 --> 22:47.334
Fuck you, TJ.

22:47.368 --> 22:49.203
Light a goddamn match.

22:49.236 --> 22:52.273
Tropic thunder
all in the hood and shit.

23:01.015 --> 23:03.050
- Mr. Jackson?
- Show's over.

23:03.084 --> 23:04.617
You can go home now.

23:42.923 --> 23:44.058
Is this the same house?

23:44.091 --> 23:45.726
I guess they mowed the lawn.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.061
Most of it, anyway.

23:47.094 --> 23:48.362
I thought you all
would be gone by now.

23:48.395 --> 23:51.198
All the shit
you all done see.

23:51.232 --> 23:54.034
You all really
trying to fuck with TJ, huh?

23:54.068 --> 23:56.270
- You like being on TV?
- No.

23:56.303 --> 23:58.072
You do now.
Show me the carburetor.

23:58.105 --> 23:59.340
Um...

23:59.373 --> 24:00.908
What the fuck you pointing at,
little nigga?

24:00.941 --> 24:02.443
It ain't no carburetor.
It's fuel injected, boy.

24:02.476 --> 24:05.279
Lil Eric?

24:05.312 --> 24:06.914
Boy, you got me walking

24:06.947 --> 24:09.049
all over this house
looking for you.

24:09.083 --> 24:10.251
Where did you sleep last night?

24:10.284 --> 24:11.919
In the car with Uncle TJ.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.888
Okay. Well, baby,
unless you want mama

24:13.921 --> 24:15.089
to break both your damn ankles,

24:15.122 --> 24:16.257
you're gonna need to let me know

24:16.290 --> 24:18.025
before you leave
out this house, okay?

24:18.058 --> 24:19.393
Thank you.

24:19.426 --> 24:21.362
And why can't your ass
park on the street

24:21.395 --> 24:23.063
like regular fucking people?

24:23.097 --> 24:25.332
Damn get... you don't have shit.

24:28.469 --> 24:29.970
Try it now.

24:39.013 --> 24:42.750
Well, hold on, nigga,
before you flood it.

24:42.783 --> 24:43.984
Try it now.

24:49.490 --> 24:53.160
Hey, go park it over there.

24:53.194 --> 24:55.162
Got my first DUI
when he's like 10 years old.

24:55.196 --> 24:56.864
Little nigga been driving
ever since.

24:56.897 --> 24:57.898
Fuck Uber.

25:00.834 --> 25:01.835
Shit.

25:07.341 --> 25:08.842
What happened?

25:08.876 --> 25:10.711
You ain't get a copy
of your parole release rules?

25:12.046 --> 25:14.048
I couldn't get my car to start.
That's why I'm late.

25:15.249 --> 25:17.184
What's this?
What's the camera crew?

25:17.218 --> 25:18.452
- Uh...
- You ain't filming

25:18.485 --> 25:20.354
- no porn shit, are you?
- No. Hey.

25:20.387 --> 25:21.322
Say hi, Lil Eric.

25:21.355 --> 25:23.224
- Hey.
- Hey, Lil Eric.

25:24.992 --> 25:28.229
Your shirt... put a shirt on.

25:28.262 --> 25:29.964
Three hundred dollars
a month in court cost.

25:29.997 --> 25:32.099
Fifty dollars
to the crime victims right fund.

25:32.132 --> 25:33.434
Ten dollars a month for a year,

25:33.467 --> 25:35.135
eleven dollars a month
to pay for my CCs

25:35.169 --> 25:36.804
and I got to pay
for UAs too, though?

25:36.837 --> 25:39.406
- That's a decent payment plan.
- For who?

25:39.440 --> 25:41.742
Well, how much're they paying
for your little life story?

25:42.943 --> 25:43.944
That's classified.

25:45.846 --> 25:47.815
Uh-uh. Hey. You, two.

25:47.848 --> 25:50.451
Come here. Come here.

25:52.486 --> 25:54.755
What are you all
really filming?

26:02.329 --> 26:06.133
You know, being TJ's PO...

26:06.166 --> 26:07.568
is frustrating, you know,

26:07.601 --> 26:10.971
because he got a lot
of potential, you know?

26:11.005 --> 26:14.908
But he stay doing
some stupid shit.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.115
<i>So you gonna go
closed caption on a nigga?</i>

26:21.148 --> 26:22.316
I'm trying
to help you earn a living

26:22.349 --> 26:23.550
and you're steady
blowing wolf tickets.

26:23.584 --> 26:24.885
- But Cheryl.
- Don't touch me.

26:24.918 --> 26:26.287
Got... you know what?
Hey, hey.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.921
I don't know when Cheryl
got the SuperGluing

26:27.955 --> 26:29.123
her asshole like that.

26:29.156 --> 26:30.491
But let me tell
y'all something...

26:30.524 --> 26:32.026
- Nigga, perimeters.
- Hey, hey, she wasn't

26:32.059 --> 26:33.460
this uptight back
in high school. Hear me?

26:33.494 --> 26:34.995
She used to manage
rappers and shit.

26:35.029 --> 26:36.230
- Remember Wonder Dyke?
- Oh.

26:36.263 --> 26:38.399
<i>♪ Love dick. Hate men. Yeah ♪</i>

26:38.432 --> 26:40.434
<i>♪ Might suck dick now and
again, but we ain't friends ♪</i>

26:40.467 --> 26:42.002
She was cold as fuck.
What happened to her?

26:42.036 --> 26:43.937
She was... she was tight.
She grew up.

26:43.971 --> 26:45.272
She got married.
She has some twins.

26:45.306 --> 26:46.473
What about you?

26:46.507 --> 26:48.375
Have you coordinated
one job interview yet?

26:48.409 --> 26:49.843
Interview for what, Cheryl?

26:49.877 --> 26:51.345
I'm gonna build
my motivational company

26:51.378 --> 26:53.947
from the floor up until
it blow up and get my dough up.

26:53.981 --> 26:55.983
How you gonna eat?
How you gonna pay bills, hmm?

26:56.016 --> 26:57.351
How you gonna
stay off them blocks?

26:57.384 --> 26:58.952
By being the world's
coldest life coach.

26:58.986 --> 27:00.421
- That's how.
- You better find that bridge.

27:00.454 --> 27:01.989
You better find that bridge

27:02.022 --> 27:03.324
because you ain't about
to be idol on my watch.

27:03.357 --> 27:04.925
Oh, I'm gonna
be somebody's idol.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.327
- You can count on that.
- And you can count on me

27:06.360 --> 27:08.062
taking your ass back to jail
if you stay unemployed.

27:08.095 --> 27:10.030
- I mean that.
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey, Lil E.

27:10.064 --> 27:13.100
Lil E.
Lil E, what's old boy's name?

27:13.133 --> 27:14.635
The Tech Jew
went on the internet,

27:14.668 --> 27:16.036
the entrepreneur and got rich.

27:16.070 --> 27:17.638
- He'll never know.
- Evan Spiegel?

27:17.671 --> 27:19.173
No, the one that be
with all the Asian gals.

27:19.206 --> 27:21.475
- Oh, I know.
- Mark Zuckerberg?

27:21.508 --> 27:22.876
That nigga. Yeah.

27:22.910 --> 27:24.545
Go on Mark Zuckerberg page
and tell him

27:24.578 --> 27:26.246
that Cheryl said
that he's unemployed.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.015
- Let me know what he say.
- No. Don't tell him that.

27:28.048 --> 27:30.117
I ain't say that.
You the one on probation.

27:30.150 --> 27:32.886
Yeah. Okay. But nobody
wanna hide no ex-felon

27:32.920 --> 27:34.488
and that's why I'm trying
to explain to you, Cheryl.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.623
You got a list of companies
that do just that, TJ.

27:36.657 --> 27:38.592
Yeah. But that list...
that list ain't as long

27:38.625 --> 27:40.094
as the list of companies
that I worked for

27:40.127 --> 27:41.328
when I was inside the joint.

27:41.362 --> 27:44.598
And that's real nigga shit.
Heard me?

27:44.631 --> 27:46.600
Yow, I might as well
talk to a fucking corpse

27:46.633 --> 27:48.302
because this,
this one don't listen.

27:48.335 --> 27:50.571
Okay. I'ma be a rich corpse.
Heard that?

27:50.604 --> 27:53.640
I promised Momma Jackson
that I was gonna do my best

27:53.674 --> 27:55.342
to keep TJ out of prison
and that's what I'm gonna do.

27:55.376 --> 27:56.944
I'm gonna do my best
to keep TJ out of prison.

27:56.977 --> 27:58.445
- Stop ear hustling.
- Cheryl don't do shit.

27:58.479 --> 28:00.247
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to them.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.182
- It's about me, though.
- Okay. As I was saying...

28:02.216 --> 28:04.084
- It's about me though.
- ...this is what we're gonna

28:04.118 --> 28:05.652
do starting bright
and early tomorrow morning,

28:05.686 --> 28:08.188
I'ma be on TJ's doorstep
every single day until he finds

28:08.222 --> 28:10.023
himself a job. And you know
what? I'ma personally drive

28:10.057 --> 28:11.658
him to every single interview
because that's, that's what

28:11.692 --> 28:13.327
- I'm... is that a check?
- Can I... Can I just... can I

28:13.360 --> 28:14.962
- show you something? No.
- Is it a check stub?

28:14.995 --> 28:16.430
- No. Okay. No. Okay.
- Is it proof of employment?

28:16.463 --> 28:18.098
Wait. But wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Hold on.

28:18.132 --> 28:19.666
Okay. Well, then there's
nothing that I need to see.

28:19.701 --> 28:21.368
The Toastmasters... if the
Toastmasters came to you

28:21.402 --> 28:23.337
and said I want you
to be on a reality show.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.506
Does that not say something
about your credentials?

28:25.539 --> 28:27.040
Nice talk, TJ.
I'ma see you tomorrow,

28:27.074 --> 28:28.675
- all right?
- I... you just...

28:28.710 --> 28:31.111
Do you think your Uncle
would make a great life coach?

28:31.145 --> 28:32.312
Don't show up
when I blow up.

28:32.346 --> 28:34.214
I don't know.

28:34.248 --> 28:36.083
You can't be a failure
and a life coach

28:36.116 --> 28:37.651
at the same time.

28:37.684 --> 28:39.386
What's wrong, Junior?

28:42.589 --> 28:44.358
I, as in Insurgents.

28:44.391 --> 28:47.194
J as in Jamiroquai.
Yes, ma'am.

28:47.227 --> 28:48.462
Yes.
Jackson.

28:48.495 --> 28:49.963
Yeah.
That's right.

28:49.997 --> 28:51.331
Uh-hmm.

28:51.365 --> 28:53.634
So how many contestants
do y'all usually have?

28:55.703 --> 28:58.539
Okay.
Uh-hmm.

28:58.572 --> 29:01.108
Well, how did Toastmasters
find me, anyway?

29:02.543 --> 29:04.344
Oh, yes.

29:04.378 --> 29:05.112
Okay.

29:06.647 --> 29:08.415
No. Yes, ma'am, I did.
Yes, I am.

29:08.449 --> 29:09.516
Uh-hmm.

29:09.550 --> 29:12.085
No, thank you.
Okay.

29:12.119 --> 29:13.987
Toastmasters just left
a little message.

29:14.021 --> 29:15.556
Your sister won't sign
the release waiver

29:15.589 --> 29:17.124
for a documentary.

29:17.157 --> 29:19.326
Fuck, I don't want her
to be in my shit, no way.

29:19.359 --> 29:22.162
But some of our best material
is with you and Lil Eric.

29:22.196 --> 29:24.097
It's the heart of our story.

29:24.131 --> 29:25.299
Shit. Give it to me.
I'll sign it.

29:25.332 --> 29:27.067
No.
Lil Eric is a minor.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.303
We need a signature
from his legal guardian.

29:29.336 --> 29:30.738
Is that Sharea?

29:30.772 --> 29:33.173
You think we can get her
to sign up before we leave?

29:34.709 --> 29:36.176
Before you leave?

29:37.712 --> 29:39.079
- Well...
- We have everything

29:39.112 --> 29:40.782
that we need.

29:40.815 --> 29:43.317
So you...

29:43.350 --> 29:44.752
you're gonna end the show
in the middle

29:44.786 --> 29:46.420
of the fucking cliffhanger?

29:46.453 --> 29:49.656
Y'all don't wanna see a nigga
go from baboon to tycoon?

29:49.690 --> 29:52.092
Mr. Jackson,
we actually didn't intend

29:52.125 --> 29:54.461
to film as much as we did.

29:54.495 --> 29:58.065
But you did. I mean, you past
that whole fucking

29:58.098 --> 29:59.466
10-minute class assignment.

29:59.500 --> 30:02.102
Now you're in that Spielberg,
Tyler Perry level shit

30:02.135 --> 30:04.037
with all the footage
you done got.

30:04.071 --> 30:06.774
Yes. But that wasn't
the assignment.

30:06.808 --> 30:08.475
Oh.
Oh.

30:08.509 --> 30:09.643
Oh.
Oh, okay.

30:09.676 --> 30:11.713
Oh, I see. College,
College Education

30:11.746 --> 30:13.213
got you trained
real good. I get it.

30:13.247 --> 30:15.182
- Okay. I get it.
- What does that mean?

30:15.215 --> 30:17.084
No. Just means that your
professor told you to do

30:17.117 --> 30:18.552
a 10-minute assignment, right?

30:18.585 --> 30:21.154
And you happened into a full
length feature blockbuster,

30:21.188 --> 30:23.257
but all you can think about
is little 10-minute project

30:23.290 --> 30:25.827
that he told you to do,
right?

30:25.860 --> 30:30.063
Well, maybe if
you did what you were told,

30:30.097 --> 30:31.766
you'd spend less time
in jail.

30:31.799 --> 30:32.800
Oh.
Wow.

30:32.834 --> 30:35.135
Spunky little Wild Child,
huh?

30:35.168 --> 30:37.304
Well, let me tell you
something.

30:38.539 --> 30:40.674
You're a little younger.
You might not get this.

30:40.708 --> 30:43.243
But you don't need bars
to be in prison.

30:43.277 --> 30:45.212
You gotta ask yourself,
"Why is it a nigga fresh out

30:45.245 --> 30:46.714
the joint can see
a brighter future for you

30:46.748 --> 30:49.416
than you can see
for yourself?" Hmm?

30:50.818 --> 30:52.519
How's that for confinement?

31:12.840 --> 31:14.441
You wanna hear some music?

31:14.474 --> 31:15.843
What music?
Your music?

31:15.877 --> 31:17.477
- Yeah.
- No.

31:27.822 --> 31:29.623
It's obvious
you don't have a plan.

31:29.656 --> 31:31.759
- Would you like to hear mine?
- Okay. Look, first of all,

31:31.793 --> 31:33.694
don't be rolling your eyes at me
because I ain't your momma.

31:33.728 --> 31:35.529
And if you tell me your plan,
don't tell it to me like you

31:35.562 --> 31:36.898
think you're smarter than me.

31:36.931 --> 31:39.266
Uh-hmm.
First things first.

31:39.299 --> 31:41.568
You have at least 10,000
followers on Prison Logic.

31:41.602 --> 31:43.270
- Uh-hmm.
- That's his blog?

31:43.303 --> 31:45.740
- Yup.
- That many followers?

31:45.773 --> 31:48.375
- Are you sure?
- I'm the one who maintains it,

31:49.911 --> 31:52.379
I think.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.315
Can I talk to my nephew
off camera for a minute, please?

31:55.349 --> 31:57.719
- Can you step outside, please?
- Yeah. Let's go.

32:03.590 --> 32:04.591
You can't be snitching.

32:04.625 --> 32:06.426
- I'm not.
- You just told her

32:06.460 --> 32:08.662
that I got you maintaining my
blog while I'm inside the joint.

32:08.695 --> 32:10.197
- But it's true.
- Yeah. Okay.

32:10.230 --> 32:13.300
Well, just don't talk
about it on camera, okay?

32:13.333 --> 32:15.903
Now, now, look, I'm talking
to you like a man, okay?

32:15.937 --> 32:18.740
Because your momma
can't do it, okay?

32:18.773 --> 32:20.407
You see that white girl
over there?

32:20.440 --> 32:21.709
She's not white.
She's Asian.

32:21.743 --> 32:23.577
Okay. Whatever. Well,
she's so black curious,

32:23.610 --> 32:24.712
she's probably gonna let me hit.

32:24.746 --> 32:26.346
But you got to make me
look good.

32:26.380 --> 32:28.649
- Make you look good?
- Man, just tell me your plan.

32:28.682 --> 32:30.417
Well, the first thing
you should do is make

32:30.450 --> 32:31.719
an announcement on your blog.

32:31.753 --> 32:33.320
Let all your followers
know you're out

32:33.353 --> 32:35.355
and starting your own
consultation business.

32:35.389 --> 32:36.891
Post it all over
the Internet.

32:36.924 --> 32:38.692
But you just can't rely
on social media.

32:38.726 --> 32:40.360
You have to connect
with the people.

32:40.394 --> 32:41.863
You have to campaign
and let the people

32:41.896 --> 32:43.563
know you're the real deal.

32:43.597 --> 32:46.366
Make flyers, go door
to door, shake hands,

32:46.400 --> 32:47.534
kiss babies.

32:49.670 --> 32:50.637
I like that.

32:50.671 --> 32:51.672
Uh-huh.

32:51.706 --> 32:52.807
You know what? Okay.

32:52.840 --> 32:53.941
Let me tell you something,
man.

32:53.975 --> 32:56.643
Look, I know you
ain't been hearing

32:56.677 --> 32:58.345
from your daddy lately
and then your momma

32:58.378 --> 32:59.881
having a tough time.
But,

32:59.914 --> 33:02.282
you know, it don't mean
that they don't love you,

33:02.315 --> 33:03.617
you hear me?

33:03.650 --> 33:05.519
I know.

33:05.552 --> 33:07.822
Okay. I like your plan though,
that's good.

33:07.855 --> 33:09.289
Come on. Let's go.

33:12.026 --> 33:13.761
All right.
Sometimes that seatbelt

33:13.795 --> 33:17.732
don't lock in so if it don't,
just sit safe, okay?

33:17.765 --> 33:20.367
Now, look, I just heard
my nephew's plan,

33:20.400 --> 33:22.436
I'll tell you the truth,
okay?

33:22.469 --> 33:24.671
Okay. It would be perfect plan
if we were selling Girl Scout

33:24.706 --> 33:26.007
cookies.

33:26.040 --> 33:28.508
This means I'm gonna stick
to my initial blueprint,

33:28.542 --> 33:30.444
okay? What I'ma do
is I'll make an announcement

33:30.477 --> 33:33.014
on my blog, okay?
Let all my followers know

33:33.047 --> 33:35.515
that I'm out the joint
and the nigga launching

33:35.549 --> 33:37.284
his own consultation company.

33:37.317 --> 33:39.386
And in fact, I'm gonna post
that shit all over the internet.

33:39.419 --> 33:41.756
- I just said that.
- But I can't just rely

33:41.789 --> 33:45.659
on social media, see?
So what I'ma do is I got...

33:45.692 --> 33:47.594
I got to connect
with the people

33:47.627 --> 33:49.764
on the grass roots level.
You know what I'm saying?

33:49.797 --> 33:51.531
So what I should do
is I got to print flyers,

33:51.565 --> 33:53.300
I gotta go door to door,
I got to shake hands,

33:53.333 --> 33:56.503
I gotta kiss babies.
Heard me?

33:56.536 --> 33:58.005
Okay. Let's get started.

34:07.982 --> 34:09.050
I got another spot.

34:11.618 --> 34:14.021
Hey, y'all interested
in some motivational speaking?

34:14.054 --> 34:15.455
Some life coaching?

34:15.489 --> 34:16.958
I can come to y'all schools
and talk.

34:16.991 --> 34:18.926
How would you feel about
yourself knowing you cheated

34:18.960 --> 34:21.996
on a woman that you spent
so much time choosing?

34:22.029 --> 34:24.598
I just now realize
how much I am insecure.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.400
My situation, my daughter
made a choice for me

34:27.434 --> 34:29.003
not to date anyone.

34:29.036 --> 34:30.570
Well, nigga,
she's your daughter.

34:30.603 --> 34:32.371
My girlfriend dumped me
in a foreign country.

34:32.405 --> 34:33.975
So, you know Hakeem
on Little Chicken?

34:34.007 --> 34:35.675
Yeah. Them niggas
doing like 12 years

34:35.710 --> 34:37.945
in MKT for kidnapping
and armed robbery.

34:37.978 --> 34:40.014
I told her she's like,
"Oh, look at me."

34:40.047 --> 34:41.748
I'm like, "Bitch,
look at me. Shit.

34:41.783 --> 34:43.416
Your love bubbles
and banging.

34:43.449 --> 34:46.087
I'm fucking up here with
the white girl ass and shit.

34:46.120 --> 34:47.855
I'm enjoying
this motherfucker.

34:47.889 --> 34:49.891
And he ain't even reply back.
I'm like, "Look, nigga,

34:49.924 --> 34:52.425
all asses look the same bent
over. Thank you.com."

34:52.458 --> 34:54.728
People should be with you
by choice

34:54.762 --> 34:55.996
not by manipulation.

34:56.030 --> 34:57.799
You've been through your
share of pain.

34:57.832 --> 34:59.801
But it's not up
to your daughter

34:59.834 --> 35:01.601
to determine
your healing process.

35:01.635 --> 35:03.570
I had just seen him,
went home,

35:03.603 --> 35:06.941
and the nurse
had called and said,

35:06.974 --> 35:08.743
"You know, your dad wants
you to come up here."

35:08.776 --> 35:12.013
You want wife,
a side chick,

35:12.046 --> 35:13.714
but you're ruining
your family for one.

35:13.748 --> 35:16.383
Well, when you say it like
that, it sounds very dumb.

35:16.416 --> 35:18.485
Well, at that point,
I will agree.

35:18.518 --> 35:20.453
- You don't like questions?
- No.

35:20.487 --> 35:23.390
Especially questions
from the people that love you.

35:23.423 --> 35:25.458
I just sit and think
that he would,

35:25.492 --> 35:27.561
you know, actually ever

35:27.594 --> 35:29.663
really pass away.

35:29.696 --> 35:32.900
Life is like a vending
machine, man.

35:32.934 --> 35:35.036
It's full of change.

35:35.069 --> 35:37.738
So you got to be wise
about your smacks.

35:37.772 --> 35:39.639
You're on this green grass

35:39.673 --> 35:41.374
looking beautiful, okay?

35:41.408 --> 35:42.977
You find a way
to point out stars

35:43.010 --> 35:44.078
and flat asses.

35:44.111 --> 35:45.545
One thing you learn
in prison,

35:45.579 --> 35:47.048
it's not about the size
of the ass,

35:47.081 --> 35:49.116
it's the size
of the asshole.

35:49.150 --> 35:51.085
We rather our kids go to
school and ask questions

35:51.118 --> 35:52.753
than come home
and ask questions.

35:52.787 --> 35:54.789
And that's the problem.
You are meditating more

35:54.822 --> 35:57.490
on a daily basis...

35:57.524 --> 36:01.162
about your history
than you are about your future,

36:01.195 --> 36:04.598
and then you ask yourself
why you keep finding niggas

36:04.631 --> 36:06.600
that can't appreciate
flat asses.

36:06.633 --> 36:07.702
Y'all getting this?

36:07.735 --> 36:10.037
This is good shit.

36:10.071 --> 36:11.839
I'm
give you an assignment.

36:11.873 --> 36:14.608
Lil E, we're getting low
on flyers.

36:14.641 --> 36:17.144
Just put them
on a nice card.

36:17.178 --> 36:18.813
That's the way
you promote a business.

36:18.846 --> 36:20.047
Let's do some more.

36:20.081 --> 36:21.615
You heard that quote
I told that one girl?

36:21.648 --> 36:23.184
Which quote?
There were so many.

36:23.217 --> 36:25.452
"Just because someone admires
you for your integrity

36:25.485 --> 36:26.754
doesn't mean
they have integrity."

36:26.787 --> 36:28.155
It's one of my favoriteas.

36:28.189 --> 36:29.891
People really took
your advice to heart.

36:29.924 --> 36:31.691
I should've made a hundred
and thirty-seven dollars

36:31.726 --> 36:33.493
off that shit too.

36:40.234 --> 36:41.601
How?

36:46.941 --> 36:48.642
you got no pocket,
do you think

36:48.675 --> 36:51.145
I can get like
five dollars from you?

37:02.023 --> 37:03.724
Can I hold $20?

37:03.758 --> 37:04.992
Can I please hold $20?

37:05.026 --> 37:06.827
So, you're actually
asking for $20?

37:06.861 --> 37:08.062
You got like $20 I can hold?

37:08.095 --> 37:10.031
Hold?
Like just a hold?

37:10.064 --> 37:11.198
Were you talking
to my daughters?

37:11.232 --> 37:13.600
- You are a fake coach.
- Yeah.

37:13.633 --> 37:15.669
I was just telling them
that I can speak at they school.

37:15.703 --> 37:17.470
You got three dollars,
you got four dollars.

37:17.504 --> 37:19.506
- You got some change?
- I don't... I... my wallet is on...

37:19.539 --> 37:22.043
is on the beach with my towel.
You didn't say in the beginning

37:22.076 --> 37:24.845
that it's gonna cost me
anything, you came up to me.

37:24.879 --> 37:26.613
- Okay.
- I mean, you did a great job.

37:26.646 --> 37:28.983
Can I just get, like...
you got... you got $10?

37:29.016 --> 37:30.751
Don't give him any money.

37:30.785 --> 37:33.220
Don't give him any money.

37:33.254 --> 37:34.956
- Did you give him money?
- Lil Eric?

37:34.989 --> 37:37.825
- Did you give him money?
- Come on.

37:37.858 --> 37:40.627
I was just talking to this
man about my life problems

37:40.660 --> 37:41.929
and he asked me for money.

37:41.963 --> 37:44.165
Uh-huh.
- He took the money.

37:44.198 --> 37:46.666
- They are with him.
- Come on, boy!

37:52.106 --> 37:54.507
That's for you, little nigga.
You worked hard.

37:56.243 --> 37:57.912
You.

37:57.945 --> 37:59.646
That is my money.

37:59.679 --> 38:01.115
Give me my money! Hey.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.883
- You want to run?
- Put on your seatbelt, boy.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.651
Give me my money.
You cannot run!

38:04.684 --> 38:06.187
You cannot... hey. Hey.

38:06.220 --> 38:07.955
Hey.
What's your problem?

38:07.989 --> 38:09.656
You cannot run.

38:09.689 --> 38:11.792
If I had my gun
I'd whoop that nigga ass.

38:11.826 --> 38:13.560
Give me my money.

38:25.672 --> 38:28.009
Lil Eric, don't you
miss being in school?

38:28.042 --> 38:29.944
I'm not missing nothing.

38:34.715 --> 38:36.250
You're not concerned
with Lil Eric

38:36.283 --> 38:37.918
- not being at school?
- Excuse me.

38:37.952 --> 38:40.121
- Do you have a permit?
- Sorry.

38:40.154 --> 38:42.757
Do you have a permit?

38:42.790 --> 38:44.325
Hey.

38:44.358 --> 38:46.060
All you get taught
in these lower income

38:46.093 --> 38:48.062
public schools is how to fade
on Sharkeesha.

38:48.095 --> 38:49.964
I went to public school,
I did fine.

38:49.997 --> 38:51.999
Is that right? How much you
wanna bet this little nigga

38:52.033 --> 38:53.834
- right here smarter than you?
- How?

38:53.868 --> 38:55.635
Let me ask you this.
Okay.

38:55.668 --> 38:57.338
There's three birds
sitting on a wire,

38:57.371 --> 39:00.007
I take out my pistol,
I shoot one of the birds

39:00.041 --> 39:01.776
on the wire, how many birds
left on the wire?

39:01.809 --> 39:03.744
What will be the proper
response to that question?

39:03.778 --> 39:05.612
- Ooh.
- I'm not talking to you,

39:05.645 --> 39:07.915
Lil Eric.
Come on now, Wild Child.

39:07.948 --> 39:09.750
What am I missing?
I don't get it.

39:09.784 --> 39:11.018
Think about it, okay?

39:11.052 --> 39:12.253
There's three birds
on the wire,

39:12.286 --> 39:14.755
I pull out the duel-y,
bust it on one.

39:14.789 --> 39:16.689
- Ah! Me.
- I get it.

39:16.724 --> 39:19.026
No birds because the sound
of the gunshot would scare off

39:19.060 --> 39:20.094
the other two birds?

39:20.127 --> 39:21.762
- Is that right?
- Ooh.

39:21.796 --> 39:23.764
- What?
- Yes, Lil Eric?

39:23.798 --> 39:26.233
The proper response would be
to ask another question.

39:26.267 --> 39:27.667
- Uh-hmm.
- Why are you shooting

39:27.701 --> 39:29.804
at the bird? Are you hungry,
Mr. Jackson?

39:29.837 --> 39:33.207
Would you like
something to eat?

39:33.240 --> 39:34.308
Hmm.

39:34.341 --> 39:36.609
Assembly line response.

39:36.643 --> 39:37.978
Human response.

39:38.012 --> 39:41.082
I don't know what you think
you learned. Shit.

39:41.115 --> 39:42.216
Oh, shit.

39:42.249 --> 39:44.118
- What's going on?
- Oh, shit.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.055
Damn. Shit.

39:49.924 --> 39:51.025
Okay.

39:52.426 --> 39:53.794
Goddamn.

39:56.730 --> 39:57.965
Shit.

40:00.234 --> 40:02.002
Wait. Wait.

40:08.442 --> 40:10.211
Look. Come here, boy.

40:12.313 --> 40:14.315
Get over here.

40:16.717 --> 40:18.352
Just hold on one second.
Wait a minute.

40:18.385 --> 40:20.087
Oh, shit. Put your foot
on the brake, boy.

40:20.121 --> 40:22.156
You're gonna put it in neutral
before hitting on the brake.

40:22.189 --> 40:24.125
Well, take your foot off the
brake now and maybe you're gonna

40:24.158 --> 40:26.026
break my back. It's rolling
back, but it

40:26.060 --> 40:28.896
roll back give
a footing because my gators,

40:28.929 --> 40:31.698
they slip.

40:31.732 --> 40:33.666
So, you're saying
Lil Eric doesn't need to go

40:33.701 --> 40:36.437
- to school?
- No, I'm saying the school

40:36.470 --> 40:38.339
is supposed to be a place
of learning, right?

40:38.372 --> 40:41.342
So, if 90% of the curriculum
is memorization,

40:41.375 --> 40:43.410
what exactly have you learned?

40:43.444 --> 40:44.812
You might learn
how to memorize

40:44.845 --> 40:47.848
but have you learned
how to learn?

40:47.882 --> 40:50.284
Justin, get your ass out
of the car and help push.

40:50.317 --> 40:52.453
Just like that, Lil Eric.

41:04.431 --> 41:05.933
We got to get some gas.

41:12.273 --> 41:14.275
Come on, boy.

41:32.293 --> 41:35.095
<i>For the first time
in my life,</i>

41:35.129 --> 41:37.231
<i>I found myself rethinking</i>

41:37.264 --> 41:39.133
<i>everything I memorized,</i>

41:39.166 --> 41:42.169
<i>everything I thought
I'd ever learned,</i>

41:42.203 --> 41:46.173
<i>who taught it to me and why.</i>

42:34.588 --> 42:37.191
Man, I tell you, you know.

42:37.224 --> 42:39.260
Don't get it twisted,
there ain't a sentimental bone

42:39.293 --> 42:40.961
in my body, you know,
but me and Cheryl,

42:40.995 --> 42:43.497
we was cool.
We had like...

42:49.169 --> 42:51.505
this motherfucker
is just trying to sabotage me.

42:53.007 --> 42:54.541
Goddamn, Momma.
That's why I don't like

42:54.575 --> 42:56.143
nobody in my room.

42:58.312 --> 42:59.980
Who left the phone off
the hook?

43:00.014 --> 43:01.915
I'm out there beating
the pavement all day trying

43:01.949 --> 43:03.484
to get the phone to ring,
I come home,

43:03.517 --> 43:05.019
the phone off the hook.

43:06.587 --> 43:08.522
When I get my money up,
man, I'm getting me a iPhone

43:08.555 --> 43:10.591
with a gang of minutes.

43:10.624 --> 43:12.826
You didn't leave my phone
off the hook, did you?

43:12.860 --> 43:15.029
Yes the fuck I did
'cause don't nobody call it

43:15.062 --> 43:16.830
but bill collectors
and telemarketers

43:16.864 --> 43:18.999
and it's getting
on my damn nerves.

43:20.334 --> 43:22.269
How'd y'all do today?

43:22.303 --> 43:25.472
I'll let Uncle TJ tell it.

43:25.506 --> 43:29.009
You were very optimistic
when you first left prison.

43:29.043 --> 43:30.611
- How do you feel now?
- Well, it's obvious

43:30.644 --> 43:33.914
we had some setbacks today
but like we say in prison,

43:33.947 --> 43:36.550
"If it ain't ISIS,
it ain't a crisis." Heard me?

43:36.583 --> 43:38.919
Four more Lil Eric, then go
down and do your push-ups.

43:38.952 --> 43:39.920
I can't.

43:39.953 --> 43:40.921
What?

43:40.954 --> 43:42.022
I've got it.

43:42.056 --> 43:43.957
I've got it.
I've got it.

43:43.991 --> 43:45.426
That's what I thought.

43:45.459 --> 43:47.995
Now go down and do four
push-ups like I showed you.

43:48.028 --> 43:49.463
We don't use that language
around here, boy,

43:49.496 --> 43:51.165
especially when TJ home.

43:51.198 --> 43:53.033
And when Cheryl come here
tomorrow, I'm gonna tell her ass

43:53.067 --> 43:55.302
straight up that I ain't
gonna apply for no damn gigs.

43:55.336 --> 43:57.071
TJ work for TJ.

43:57.104 --> 43:59.139
Can't take me out the plastic
and put me back in the box

43:59.173 --> 44:00.974
like some of these
collectible niggas.

44:01.008 --> 44:03.310
That's why we ain't together
now. Good job, wardy.

44:03.344 --> 44:04.945
Go and get you a meal.

44:06.914 --> 44:08.215
Momma.

44:41.515 --> 44:43.250
I think if I show people
some of my writings,

44:43.283 --> 44:45.252
I might give them a good idea
of what I'm capable of,

44:45.285 --> 44:47.688
this
my seminar called

44:47.722 --> 44:49.456
"What You See
Is What You Saw ."

44:49.490 --> 44:51.592
Shit might be a good title
for this documentary.

44:51.625 --> 44:53.494
- Is it published?
- It's not yet but once

44:53.527 --> 44:55.295
this movie come out,
watch what happens.

44:55.329 --> 44:59.199
Hey, we gotta go
before Cheryl get here.

45:12.446 --> 45:14.381
Where are you going?
I can't go with you?

45:14.415 --> 45:16.083
Junior?

45:16.116 --> 45:17.951
Is that you out there?

45:25.392 --> 45:27.361
This one's hotter.
It's a little hotter, Momma.

45:27.394 --> 45:29.496
Here, just... okay.

45:29.530 --> 45:31.532
- I'll just put it right here.
- Ooh, all right.

45:31.565 --> 45:33.667
All right.

45:33.701 --> 45:36.503
Oh, thank
you, baby.

45:36.537 --> 45:37.971
- Ooh, and...
- Okay.

45:38.005 --> 45:40.742
And empty my bedpan,
please.

45:40.775 --> 45:42.543
Momma, act like
you got some shame.

45:42.576 --> 45:43.977
There's cameras in here.

45:44.011 --> 45:45.312
Oh, boy.

45:47.414 --> 45:49.116
When the last time
y'all emptied this out?

45:49.149 --> 45:51.485
About a week ago
when Oprah's on "The Butler."

45:53.153 --> 45:54.555
You taking them things
on an empty stomach?

45:54.588 --> 45:56.390
That's probably why you're
getting sick in the morning.

45:56.423 --> 45:58.292
Get them out of here, boy.

46:13.574 --> 46:16.143
You hungry?

46:16.176 --> 46:17.712
Give this to your grandmomma.

46:30.524 --> 46:32.426
Hey.

46:32.459 --> 46:33.761
Hey.

46:33.795 --> 46:36.463
Look early,
I'm impressed, TJ.

46:36.497 --> 46:37.799
I get to spend the day
with you.

46:37.832 --> 46:39.734
- I was looking forward to it.
- Oh, man.

46:39.767 --> 46:41.703
- You look nice.
- Aw, thank you.

46:41.736 --> 46:44.404
Look at you.
You just... you know what?

46:44.438 --> 46:46.406
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

46:46.440 --> 46:49.576
Hey.
Y'all two.

46:49.610 --> 46:51.378
I'm feeling a little
cooperative today,

46:51.411 --> 46:53.380
TJ and I showered up early.
Come on.

46:53.413 --> 46:55.249
Y'all wanna rode?
Catch them glimpses

46:55.282 --> 46:57.317
- of his little life?
- I told you.

46:57.351 --> 46:59.286
You ain't tell me and then
you was over there messing

46:59.319 --> 47:01.255
- with that other girl.
- She was messing with me.

47:01.288 --> 47:02.689
I was just doing
what I had to do.

47:02.724 --> 47:05.392
- You know she got shot.
- Yeah. Uh-hmm.

47:06.360 --> 47:07.361
Lost her leg.

47:07.394 --> 47:08.695
Yeah. I heard.
I heard.

47:08.730 --> 47:11.265
I thought she lost her leg
with diabetes.

47:11.298 --> 47:12.299
That's what they said

47:12.332 --> 47:13.735
but she started
stripping again,

47:13.768 --> 47:15.369
- so I...
- Oh with a little specialty shot

47:15.402 --> 47:16.403
what they do
on the amputees.

47:16.436 --> 47:17.739
- Yeah.
- Yup.

47:17.772 --> 47:20.240
That shot
make a lot of money.

47:21.408 --> 47:22.442
Give me that.

47:22.476 --> 47:24.511
Oh, my God.
Thank you.

47:28.248 --> 47:30.584
I try not to deal
with that kind of,

47:30.617 --> 47:33.253
negative environment
anymore, you know?

47:33.287 --> 47:34.655
You know, I try
to stay positive.

47:34.688 --> 47:36.156
I'm back in church.

47:36.189 --> 47:37.725
I have to make sure
the job don't take...

47:37.759 --> 47:40.394
part of me,
take hold of me,

47:40.427 --> 47:42.095
you know?
What the focus is...

47:42.129 --> 47:43.630
with you is to really...

47:43.664 --> 47:45.332
hey, Sharlene.

47:45.365 --> 47:47.401
But let me tell you
something about Sharlene,

47:47.434 --> 47:49.636
Sharlene...

47:49.670 --> 47:51.605
Sharlene got three jobs.

47:51.638 --> 47:53.440
How old he tell you
he was?

47:53.473 --> 47:54.842
How old?
What did he say?

47:54.876 --> 47:57.344
- I think like 32.
- What?

47:58.445 --> 47:59.646
No. I said... no.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.148
I said it's been 32 years

48:01.181 --> 48:04.284
since I've been to juvie.

48:04.318 --> 48:06.486
- Don't let her fool you.
- Don't listen to the...

48:06.520 --> 48:08.221
Don't let Cheryl fool you.
Just so you know,

48:08.255 --> 48:09.757
- okay?
- I wonder, uh... listen.

48:09.791 --> 48:11.759
She might look young
but let me tell you something.

48:11.793 --> 48:13.226
Cheryl got that
vintage pussy.

48:13.260 --> 48:14.428
Don't let her fool you.

48:14.461 --> 48:15.830
She got that vintage
pussy, okay? She...

48:15.863 --> 48:17.130
- MVP.
- She might be young

48:17.164 --> 48:19.399
MVP.

48:19.433 --> 48:20.868
That's what
it's there for.

48:20.902 --> 48:23.570
- MVP.
- Uh-huh.

48:23.604 --> 48:26.139
Okay. Uh-hmm.

48:26.173 --> 48:27.174
You know, nigga.

48:27.207 --> 48:28.609
Don't... listen.
This is...

48:28.642 --> 48:30.644

- Okay. Y'all can't handle that

48:36.483 --> 48:37.719
'cause you're professional.

48:37.752 --> 48:39.186

Go inside,

48:40.955 --> 48:42.824
and I'mma have you

48:44.391 --> 48:46.560
Hurry up,

49:18.993 --> 49:21.194
Reasons
for leaving prior jobs?

49:21.228 --> 49:22.496
What? What do you mean?

49:22.529 --> 49:24.264
Why did you stop doing
telecommunications?

49:24.297 --> 49:25.532
Because I got out
of prison.

49:25.565 --> 49:26.968
Okay. Why did you
stop tilapia farming?

49:27.001 --> 49:28.535
Because I got out
of prison.

49:28.568 --> 49:30.337

I told you.

52:53.808 --> 52:55.475
What the fuck did I tell you?
Did you...

52:55.508 --> 52:57.477
did y'all get that...
did y'all get that on video?

52:57.510 --> 52:58.612
Did you get that?
You get that?

52:58.645 --> 53:00.014
- What did I tell you?
- Orlando?

53:00.047 --> 53:01.849
- Disney World?
- Shh. Goddamn.

53:01.883 --> 53:03.617
- What is it, Junior?
- Nothing, momma.

53:03.650 --> 53:05.086
Just got me a job.
That's all.

53:05.119 --> 53:07.788
Let me be the one to tell her
what it is, okay?

53:07.822 --> 53:10.690
Goddamn.
Hold it down, nigga.

53:10.725 --> 53:11.893
What'd I tell y'all?

53:11.926 --> 53:13.593
What did I say?

53:17.597 --> 53:20.400
Is it a progress,
only have one source of ID?

53:21.903 --> 53:23.570
Okay.

53:23.603 --> 53:24.972
Uh-hmm.

53:25.006 --> 53:26.741
Yes, ma'am.

53:26.774 --> 53:29.010
Oh, I'mma be there bright
and early.

53:29.944 --> 53:32.713
No, thank you.

53:32.747 --> 53:35.482
If you do an inventory check
of your thoughts,

53:35.515 --> 53:37.617
85%, 95% of your thoughts
is negative.

53:37.651 --> 53:39.186
You know I'm saying?
You have to un-niggafy

53:39.220 --> 53:41.022
yourself and start
focusing on...

53:41.055 --> 53:42.522
positive outcomes.

53:42.555 --> 53:44.959
You gotta focus
on the positive possibilities

53:44.992 --> 53:46.928
in order to produce
positive results.

53:46.961 --> 53:49.196
What I'm not gonna do
is I'm not gonna let

53:49.230 --> 53:51.032
a bad day dictate
the outcome

53:51.065 --> 53:53.500
of my whole year.
Hear me?

53:53.533 --> 53:54.567
I totally get it.

53:54.601 --> 53:55.770
That's what's up.

53:55.803 --> 53:57.238
And I still got a few
hurdles ahead of me,

53:57.271 --> 53:59.040
you know, because...

53:59.073 --> 54:00.708
my momma ain't
gonna approve of me just,

54:00.741 --> 54:02.609
you know, running off
to Orlando like that.

54:02.642 --> 54:04.644
And as a parolee,
I can't really just,

54:04.678 --> 54:05.947
you know,
I gotta get permission

54:05.980 --> 54:07.480
from my probation officer.

54:07.514 --> 54:08.950
Because she ain't...

54:10.684 --> 54:12.253
Speak of the devil.

54:12.286 --> 54:14.188
What if I get
my shit rolling,

54:14.221 --> 54:15.622
and make you my manager?

54:15.655 --> 54:17.490
I give you 10%
off the top right to you.

54:17.524 --> 54:19.226
I don't want 10%
of your pipedream.

54:19.260 --> 54:20.527
That was high school.

54:20.560 --> 54:21.762
Come on, we grown-ups now.

54:21.796 --> 54:23.264
Okay. Note to self,
real quick.

54:23.297 --> 54:24.999
Bagging groceries
are what grown-ups do,

54:25.032 --> 54:27.667
- being a self-made...
- Travel permits denied.

54:27.702 --> 54:30.004
You are not listening.
She is not listening.

54:30.037 --> 54:31.839
I'm not listening.
I'm not gonna put my job

54:31.872 --> 54:33.640
in jeopardy
for you anymore.

54:33.673 --> 54:35.508
She about the dumbest deputy
this side of Broward County.

54:35.542 --> 54:37.078
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

54:37.111 --> 54:38.678
- Get out.
- Cheryl,

54:38.713 --> 54:40.613
I just gave you an
opportunity to be somebody.

54:40.647 --> 54:42.615
- You know what you said?
- Get out.

54:42.649 --> 54:44.085
No, y'all get out first,
so y'all can see me

54:44.118 --> 54:45.286
when I merk
on her ass, okay?

54:45.319 --> 54:46.887
Get out.

54:46.921 --> 54:48.621
You all get
the fuck out, too.

54:48.655 --> 54:50.557
Turn that camera off.

55:00.334 --> 55:02.602
<i>Errbody ain't gonna get
to play on the All-Star team,</i>

55:02.635 --> 55:04.705
<i>you heard me? No one.
As long as I've known Cheryl,</i>

55:04.739 --> 55:05.973
<i>that Cheryl problem.</i>

55:06.007 --> 55:07.640
<i>The only future
she see for herself</i>

55:07.674 --> 55:09.143
<i>is the future
that they laid out for her.</i>

55:09.176 --> 55:10.945
<i>You heard me?
So it's hard for her to relate</i>

55:10.978 --> 55:13.948
<i>to a visionary such as myself.</i>

55:13.981 --> 55:16.583
Let me tell y'all
something I've learned.

55:16.616 --> 55:19.053
If you consistently feed
and exercise your faith,

55:19.086 --> 55:20.821
it will eventually
outgrow your fears.

55:20.855 --> 55:23.124
Today's billionaires,
they earn they billions

55:23.157 --> 55:24.959
by taking chances
on the unknown,

55:24.992 --> 55:27.660
while the rest of us stay
enslaved by the familiar.

55:27.694 --> 55:28.963
Today, and as of today,

55:28.996 --> 55:30.965
I'm strictly on my
billionaire ground,

55:30.998 --> 55:33.834
and I denounce
that petty hustler.

55:33.868 --> 55:35.836
Shit.

55:35.870 --> 55:37.604
Hey, y'all got...
y'all got some change

55:37.637 --> 55:40.041
or bus pass
a nigga can borrow?

55:44.879 --> 55:45.946
What's up Lil Eric?

55:45.980 --> 55:47.248
Nothin'.

55:47.281 --> 55:48.849
Yo, this yo gal?

55:48.883 --> 55:50.251
Darlene,
this is my Uncle TJ.

55:50.284 --> 55:51.752
Hi.

55:51.786 --> 55:53.154
She ain't white,
she light skinned, boy.

55:53.187 --> 55:54.587
I'm half white.

55:54.621 --> 55:56.123
No, with all them yams
on your plate.

55:56.157 --> 55:57.858
She is
celebrating with us, Junior.

55:57.892 --> 55:59.894
- God damn. Y'all made greens?
- Watch your mouth, boy.

55:59.927 --> 56:01.262
Copy that.
What are we celebrating?

56:01.295 --> 56:02.662
Didn't you just get a job?

56:02.695 --> 56:05.665
- Too bad it's in Orlando.
- What?

56:05.698 --> 56:07.168
- You shut up.
- Orlando?

56:07.201 --> 56:08.736
Yeah, momma.
He tried to sneak down

56:08.769 --> 56:10.071
to Orlando to be a Toastmaster.

56:10.104 --> 56:11.272
I guess he too good
for us now.

56:11.305 --> 56:12.740
If you don't wanna be
on camera,

56:12.773 --> 56:14.308
all you gotta do
is shut your mouth.

56:14.341 --> 56:16.010
- Fuck you.
- Momma, you heard her curse,

56:16.043 --> 56:17.378
- right?
- Orlando, Junior? You know,

56:17.411 --> 56:19.080
- my arthritis acting up.
- Momma, you gonna

56:19.113 --> 56:20.848
- let her curse like that?
- What am I supposed to do?

56:20.881 --> 56:22.149
You gonna let her curse
like that in front of company?

56:22.183 --> 56:23.350
How come every time
I say a bad word.

56:23.384 --> 56:24.785
'Cause you're
the eldest, Junior,

56:24.819 --> 56:26.387
- and you should know better.
- God damn.

56:26.420 --> 56:27.687
- Say it in front of the camera.
- Watch your mouth, Junior.

56:27.721 --> 56:29.156
Why she get to curse
and I don't?

56:29.190 --> 56:31.325
You heard her, Dick Gregory,
because you're old as hell.

56:31.358 --> 56:33.094
I hope a porcupine
crawl up in your mouth

56:33.127 --> 56:34.328
while you sleep
and take a shit.

56:34.361 --> 56:35.796
You ain't going
to Orlando, Junior.

56:35.830 --> 56:37.331
Momma, you want
the house with the pool?

56:37.364 --> 56:38.833
This is how
I'm gonna get the house

56:38.866 --> 56:40.000
with the pool for you.

56:40.034 --> 56:41.102
You want me to get a job?

56:41.135 --> 56:42.703
This is a legitimate job.

56:42.736 --> 56:44.405
Junior, why don't
you date Cheryl?

56:44.438 --> 56:46.740
Junior, why won't you pick up
Lil Eric from school?

56:46.774 --> 56:48.309
Junior, why don't you go
pick up my meds?

56:48.342 --> 56:50.010
What do y'all do
when I'm not here?

56:50.044 --> 56:51.245
I'mma tell you
what they do.

56:51.278 --> 56:52.713
They do just fine.

56:52.746 --> 56:54.014
See, that's a
rhetorical question.

56:54.048 --> 56:55.249
This ain't about me
going away,

56:55.282 --> 56:57.251
this is about me
growing away.

56:57.284 --> 56:58.886
They scared of that change,
they came...

56:58.919 --> 57:00.387
they came to us with that
transformation.

57:00.421 --> 57:01.956
Y'all ain't never made
this big a deal

57:01.989 --> 57:03.991
- of me going to jail.
- Nigga, you chose jail.

57:04.024 --> 57:05.692
Yeah, I'm choosing
this now, which is why

57:05.726 --> 57:07.660
I got selected for the
Toastmasters reality show,

57:07.694 --> 57:09.196
and somebody with
stretch marks did not.

57:09.230 --> 57:11.098
- That's enough, Junior.
- I'm not talking about

57:11.132 --> 57:12.433
your stretch marks, momma.
I'm talking about Sharea.

57:12.466 --> 57:14.001
They didn't have no time
for a nigga

57:14.034 --> 57:15.436
when he was in the joint,
now I'm outside,

57:15.469 --> 57:17.037
they gonna try to tell me
what I could do.

57:17.071 --> 57:18.439
You know I can't write
no letters

57:18.472 --> 57:19.707
with this arthritis.

57:19.740 --> 57:22.243
I can't even get on a computer.

57:22.276 --> 57:24.945
So, you couldn't just make
a call, momma?

57:26.413 --> 57:29.150
You can't shoot me
a kite, not one.

57:30.151 --> 57:31.385
You know, if Sharea
was in jail,

57:31.418 --> 57:33.087
- you know that you...
- Don't put my name

57:33.120 --> 57:34.355
in your mouth, TJ.

57:34.388 --> 57:36.223
Start me out, all right,
because you don't know

57:36.257 --> 57:37.892
what momma would do.

57:37.925 --> 57:39.393
You want me to pay

57:39.426 --> 57:41.829
a $10 deposit fee

57:41.862 --> 57:44.165
and a $3 flat fee

57:44.198 --> 57:45.466
just to put money on your phone,

57:45.499 --> 57:47.701
just so I can call you?

57:47.735 --> 57:50.304
That's $13 for 15 minutes,
Junior.

57:50.337 --> 57:53.207
And the only thing I can hear
is your misery,

57:53.240 --> 57:55.075
and the absence
of the Holy Ghost

57:55.109 --> 57:57.344
in the background.

58:08.355 --> 58:09.823
<i>Look at this material.</i>

58:09.857 --> 58:12.059
This man's club.
I got it in Vegas.

58:12.092 --> 58:13.360
They was doing this deal
if you buy

58:13.394 --> 58:14.995
two tanks of gas,
you get a free suit.

58:15.029 --> 58:17.731
This shit nice.
Get a close up on it.

58:17.765 --> 58:18.866
Look at this material.

58:18.899 --> 58:20.201
Look at that.

58:20.234 --> 58:22.436
Man's club,
look at these lapels,

58:22.469 --> 58:23.971
that's gotta be,
that's Italian

58:24.004 --> 58:27.074
or French, or something.

58:27.107 --> 58:30.411
They probably import shit
with the tag on it.

58:30.444 --> 58:32.179
You can't read it,
but...

58:32.213 --> 58:33.948
you can tell about it
just by the font.

58:33.981 --> 58:36.917
That's some upper echelon
shit right there.

58:38.385 --> 58:39.954
Uh-hmm.
This motherfucking

58:39.987 --> 58:42.790
into plastic, heard me?

58:42.823 --> 58:45.159
Look, you gonna sign this
release form or not, okay?

58:45.192 --> 58:48.028
Because my whole future
riding on this signature.

58:49.463 --> 58:51.498
- I just need you to put...
- TJ, get that fucking paper

58:51.532 --> 58:53.334
out of my face, okay? 'cause
I'm not signing this shit

58:53.367 --> 58:55.536
because I don't wanna be in your
stupid ass movie.

58:55.569 --> 58:57.037
Okay?

58:57.071 --> 58:58.939
Okay.

58:58.973 --> 59:00.407
Would you, uh...

59:00.441 --> 59:02.343
Yeah. Okay.

59:02.376 --> 59:04.912
...shake your ass on
Instagram though, huh?

59:04.945 --> 59:06.213
Uh-hmm.

59:06.247 --> 59:09.850
Underscore, underscore,
MrsTwerkulance.

59:09.883 --> 59:11.318
Ain't nobody seen it yet,
but they will,

59:11.352 --> 59:12.920
and don't try
to delete the account,

59:12.953 --> 59:14.188
but guess what?

59:14.221 --> 59:16.557
I already downloaded
all the videos.

59:16.590 --> 59:18.859
Hmm. Okay.

59:18.892 --> 59:21.128
Your son could use
a riding on this, too.

59:23.564 --> 59:27.101
Hey, can you turn the
cameras off, please?

01:00:29.296 --> 01:00:31.498
Come see a happy Jackson family
for a change.

01:00:31.532 --> 01:00:33.200
Come on in.

01:00:33.233 --> 01:00:35.002
We gonna start...
we gonna start the whole,

01:00:35.035 --> 01:00:36.470
show whole the room, okay?

01:00:36.503 --> 01:00:39.340
This is my ugly sister,
Sharea.

01:00:39.373 --> 01:00:41.975
My name is Tijuana Jackson,

01:00:42.009 --> 01:00:44.411
life coach with a goon hand.

01:00:44.445 --> 01:00:46.447
You can't stand him,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.415
no, they can't.

01:00:48.449 --> 01:00:51.485
That's the thing about
family, man, you know,

01:00:51.518 --> 01:00:53.354
it's a place you have
your biggest battles,

01:00:53.387 --> 01:00:54.955
you know,
but it's also a way you go

01:00:54.988 --> 01:00:56.490
to heal your wounds,
if you lucky.

01:00:56.523 --> 01:00:58.058
And I'm hoping
my shit take off

01:00:58.092 --> 01:00:59.893
like Miley Cyrus panties.
Once they happen,

01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:01.395
then we out this bitch.
I'm gonna get my mom

01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:03.597
that big old house
with the pool, heard me?

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:04.998
- Thank you.
- Momma,

01:01:05.032 --> 01:01:08.068
TJ is smoking in my room.

01:01:08.102 --> 01:01:09.203
No, I'm not.

01:01:37.331 --> 01:01:39.333
Momma, we only gonna be gone
for a couple of days.

01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:41.201
Anything you need,
just tell Sharea.

01:01:41.235 --> 01:01:43.570
Just like when I was
in the joint.

01:01:43.604 --> 01:01:44.671
Okay. Bye, boy.

01:01:44.706 --> 01:01:46.073
Okay. You know,
I can't stand you,

01:01:46.106 --> 01:01:47.408
but momma like you,
so hurry back.

01:01:47.441 --> 01:01:48.442
Yeah. But don't let her
take the medication

01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:49.443
on an empty stomach, man.

01:01:49.476 --> 01:01:51.044
She'll nag you all damn day.

01:01:51.078 --> 01:01:53.514
- Bye, Unc.
- You think all the shit

01:01:53.547 --> 01:01:55.015
in the car packed just for me?

01:01:55.048 --> 01:01:56.650
Your momma packed your shit
last night, boy,

01:01:56.683 --> 01:01:58.385
this ain't Malaysia Air.
I need a good co-pilot.

01:01:58.419 --> 01:01:59.686
- Get in the car.
- Listen. I don't...

01:01:59.721 --> 01:02:01.288
- For real?
- Yes for real. I don't want you

01:02:01.321 --> 01:02:02.956
sitting here
playing on your iPad all day.

01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:05.259
I figured, what would your
uncle learn new stuff.

01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:07.227
Can we go to Disney World?

01:02:07.261 --> 01:02:08.495
It's already
in the itinerary.

01:02:08.529 --> 01:02:09.496
Get in the fucking the car.

01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:11.465
Jesus is alive.

01:02:11.498 --> 01:02:13.033
In the car.

01:02:13.066 --> 01:02:14.968
Better watch out he talking
to my fucking son.

01:02:15.002 --> 01:02:16.270
Get in the car.

01:02:16.303 --> 01:02:17.438
Come on, Justin.

01:02:17.471 --> 01:02:19.440
Put on your seatbelt, boy.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:24.478
Get in the fucking car.

01:02:27.681 --> 01:02:29.149
Shit.

01:02:31.618 --> 01:02:33.187
Hey,
what y'all doing?

01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:35.322
Isn't that your
probation officer?

Somebody stole my

01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:34.515
back in the day.

01:03:34.548 --> 01:03:36.784
Is that why you
don't hear nothing?

01:03:46.393 --> 01:03:48.295
Are you enjoying yourself?

01:03:48.328 --> 01:03:51.365
Yeah, but I can't wait
to get to Disney World.

01:03:51.398 --> 01:03:52.366
Well, it's coming.

01:03:52.399 --> 01:03:54.101
Y'all get it all on film.

01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:55.536
I just wanna show
some bonding moments

01:03:55.569 --> 01:03:57.471
with my nephew.

01:03:57.504 --> 01:04:00.440
Y'all, y'all, come get
a close up of this.

01:04:00.474 --> 01:04:01.809
Y'all wanna see some gators?

01:04:01.843 --> 01:04:03.577
Throw that rock
in there, Lil Eric.

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:05.345
They didn't swarm this out
because they ain't

01:04:05.379 --> 01:04:07.147
- throwing it off far enough.
- Son, that's an example...

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:09.216
- Throw it. Yeah, like that,
flick your fist, boy.

01:04:09.249 --> 01:04:10.450
Put your hands down like...

01:04:10.484 --> 01:04:12.319
there you go, there you go.
So what now?

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:14.187
Hey, you seemed
you're taking a picture

01:04:14.221 --> 01:04:16.156
- while you're smiling.
- I'm not smiling.

01:04:21.461 --> 01:04:22.629
Come on, boy.

01:04:22.663 --> 01:04:26.099
I'm not getting in that water.

01:04:26.133 --> 01:04:27.267
You better come on.

01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:37.678
- Oh, that's a gator.
- What?

01:04:37.712 --> 01:04:39.346
That's a...

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:40.414
ain't no gator, boy.

01:04:40.447 --> 01:04:42.282
I'm just playing with you.

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:48.723
You're driving.

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.862
You can drive if
you want to.

01:05:33.367 --> 01:05:34.568
Why can't
we go inside?

01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:36.470
Watch your tone
with me, boy.

01:05:36.503 --> 01:05:38.505
I thought you said
it was in the itinerary.

01:05:38.538 --> 01:05:39.774
I said it was
in the itinerary.

01:05:39.807 --> 01:05:41.341
I didn't say it was
in the budget. Now,

01:05:41.375 --> 01:05:42.676
look, look here.
We ain't got

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:43.945
that Disney World
money right now,

01:05:43.978 --> 01:05:45.612
but when this Toastmaster
thing pop off,

01:05:45.646 --> 01:05:46.881
I might buy
your own Disney World.

01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:48.783
Matter fact,
you know what I might do,

01:05:48.816 --> 01:05:50.785
is I might buy Michael Jackson's
Neverland Ranch,

01:05:50.818 --> 01:05:52.352
and open that up
to black folks.

01:05:52.386 --> 01:05:53.721
Do you wanna go back
to the street sign

01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:54.956
and get a picture
under that?

01:05:54.989 --> 01:05:56.791
You can show your friends?

01:06:05.265 --> 01:06:06.633
Wise man speaks

01:06:06.667 --> 01:06:08.201
because he has
something to say.

01:06:08.235 --> 01:06:10.203
And nigga talk
because he always got to say so.

01:06:10.237 --> 01:06:11.773
Momma said
this is for you.

01:06:11.806 --> 01:06:12.740
What's this?

01:06:12.774 --> 01:06:14.474
I don't know.

01:06:15.575 --> 01:06:18.713
Nigga,
this the release form.

01:06:18.746 --> 01:06:20.280
This the release form.
She signed it.

01:06:20.313 --> 01:06:21.615
We're making a movie, nigga.

01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:23.350
We're going platinum, nigga.

01:06:23.383 --> 01:06:24.618
You better be famous, boy.

01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:27.254
Y'all see that?
She signed it.

01:06:27.989 --> 01:06:29.656
I told you
what I told you.

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:32.592
I told y'all that I was
gonna get her to sign.

01:06:32.626 --> 01:06:34.594
She know what's good for.

01:06:34.628 --> 01:06:36.964
Toastmasters auditions.

01:06:36.998 --> 01:06:39.433
This is that moment
of truth.

01:06:41.803 --> 01:06:43.503
I'mma let you
carry my briefcase.

01:06:43.537 --> 01:06:44.806
No.

01:06:50.544 --> 01:06:52.814
My collar straight,
everything cool?

01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:55.850
It's good.

01:06:55.883 --> 01:06:57.919
Let's go
change some lives.

01:07:00.822 --> 01:07:03.490
Nigga look
familiar as fuck.

01:07:07.527 --> 01:07:09.362
That nigga looks
familiar.

01:07:09.396 --> 01:07:10.765
How you doing, man?

01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:12.499
Tijuana Jackson, life coach,
motivational speaker.

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:13.768
I'm here for
the Toastmasters.

01:07:13.801 --> 01:07:15.402
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Listen, man, no minors,

01:07:15.435 --> 01:07:18.538
no smoking, and, uh,
you know, no cameras.

01:07:18.572 --> 01:07:20.775
Oh, no, like, they... this is
like a little student film, man,

01:07:20.808 --> 01:07:22.744
they just... they, they
filming my body, the glory.

01:07:22.777 --> 01:07:24.812
Well, yeah, they can... they can
film whatever they want, man,

01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:26.047
as long as it's not
inside, you know.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.348
Oh, well, shit.

01:07:28.381 --> 01:07:30.650
Well, Lil Eric, you gonna
stay in the car, okay?

01:07:30.684 --> 01:07:32.285
You can't be serious?

01:07:32.319 --> 01:07:33.855
No, not me, it's him.
He's saying no minors.

01:07:33.888 --> 01:07:35.056
Yeah, sorry little, bro.

01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:37.859
What is this,
a Miley Cyrus concert?

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:41.062
And y'all gonna have to
stay outside.

01:07:41.095 --> 01:07:43.396
You got to... you got to sit
in the car, Lil Eric.

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:44.766
No.

01:07:44.799 --> 01:07:47.667
Hey, Eric, do you want to film
some stuff out here?

01:07:47.702 --> 01:07:48.668
Here.

01:07:48.703 --> 01:07:49.871
Take this.

01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:53.373
Look, this is on
and off, record.

01:07:53.406 --> 01:07:55.743
Hey, look, I left
the key in the car,

01:07:55.777 --> 01:07:57.044
you can listen
to the radio.

01:07:57.078 --> 01:07:58.512
Heads up.

01:08:02.049 --> 01:08:03.550
Definitely got this.

01:08:03.583 --> 01:08:05.987
Look at all these Rounders.
How do you plead?

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.922
No contest, Your Honor.
They ain't even in my league.

01:08:07.955 --> 01:08:09.556
What these niggas don't
understand is

01:08:09.589 --> 01:08:11.691
when it's gang time,
they're playing stops.

01:08:11.726 --> 01:08:12.827
No class.

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.461
- Now, yo, yo, yo.
- No class.

01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:16.429
Fuck you nigga,
I was already up here.

01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:17.799
I just went back to get
something in my car.

01:08:17.832 --> 01:08:19.000
All right. All right.
Easy, easy.

01:08:19.033 --> 01:08:21.736
Fuck you
ass.

01:08:23.569 --> 01:08:25.072
That's what I do
with my mixtape,

01:08:25.106 --> 01:08:27.742
Affirmation Music
Volume 1.

01:08:29.442 --> 01:08:30.745
It's a drop, nigga.

01:08:30.778 --> 01:08:32.078
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck? Wait. Wait.

01:08:32.113 --> 01:08:33.915
- It's a drop.
- Amiga.

01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:35.750
Get out. Get out. Okay.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:08:35.783 --> 01:08:36.917
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Wait. Wait up.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.527
Get away from me

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.395
Yo

01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:51.497
Get down
the get down.

01:08:54.533 --> 01:08:56.737
Ow, what is your problem?

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:59.639
Fucking crazy.
Are you serious right now?

01:08:59.673 --> 01:09:02.143
And you, yeah, you.

01:09:02.176 --> 01:09:04.444
Come here, man.
I see... no, I see you, man.

01:09:04.477 --> 01:09:06.013
Come here. Hey, hey.

01:09:06.046 --> 01:09:07.782
Yo, I need you to
stop filming me right now.

01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:09.482
You said we can film
whatever we wanted

01:09:09.515 --> 01:09:10.952
as long as not inside
the fucking building.

01:09:10.984 --> 01:09:14.554
I know. I know
I'm saying you can.

01:09:14.587 --> 01:09:16.057
Hey, Rachel. Rachel.

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:17.992
We're back to do
what we told now, huh?

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:19.658
You're gonna let that
bitch clown nigga

01:09:19.693 --> 01:09:21.162
- intimidate you and to be like...
- Shut up.

01:09:21.194 --> 01:09:23.064
- Hey, Maricon.
- I thought filming

01:09:23.096 --> 01:09:26.000
police officers in Florida is
in accordance with Florida law,

01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:28.135
as long as I don't interfere
with the investigation

01:09:28.169 --> 01:09:30.872
and maintain a safe distance.

01:09:30.904 --> 01:09:32.572
I can think of
about maybe two things

01:09:32.606 --> 01:09:35.009
that you guys have
in common.

01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:37.611
Does anybody wanna guess
what they are?

01:09:37.644 --> 01:09:38.845
Go ahead.
You know what?

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:42.183
Raise your hand
if you still think

01:09:42.216 --> 01:09:44.584
you're part of a Toastmasters
reality program.

01:09:44.618 --> 01:09:46.553
Go ahead,
raise your hand.

01:09:46.586 --> 01:09:48.555
Oh, my God. These are...

01:09:48.587 --> 01:09:51.524
these are brilliant human
beings right here.

01:09:51.558 --> 01:09:54.594
I got some bad news
for you, guys.

01:09:54.628 --> 01:09:57.597
You all have outstanding
warrants

01:09:57.631 --> 01:09:59.566
right here in Orlando County.

01:10:01.969 --> 01:10:04.972
So if you guys wanna pay off
your debts today,

01:10:05.006 --> 01:10:08.508
hey, you guys are gonna walk
away with no problem,

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.444
but the rest of you guys
are going for a little joyride

01:10:18.585 --> 01:10:21.488
Appreciate y'all paying
off my warrant.

01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:25.026
I'mma pay y'all back as soon as
I get my company up and running.

01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:29.997
Where the fuck is my car?

01:10:31.665 --> 01:10:34.068
Where the fuck
did I park my car?

01:10:38.873 --> 01:10:40.674
Hey, Lil Eric.

01:10:43.643 --> 01:10:45.980
What the fuck
happened to my car?

01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:58.993
Hey, man, y'all see
a little 14-year-old kid

01:10:59.026 --> 01:11:03.030
about this big?

01:11:03.064 --> 01:11:04.564
Not this time.

01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:06.701
Have a nice day though.

01:11:18.879 --> 01:11:20.781
Lil Eric.

01:11:26.153 --> 01:11:28.022
Lil Eric.

01:11:30.291 --> 01:11:32.827
It's okay, Lil Eric,
where you at?

01:11:42.103 --> 01:11:43.804
Fuck.

01:11:45.806 --> 01:11:46.807
Let me see your phone.

01:11:46.841 --> 01:11:48.575
No.

01:11:49.276 --> 01:11:51.746
Then stop filming me.

01:11:51.779 --> 01:11:53.914
Stop filming me.

01:12:25.346 --> 01:12:28.149
Mr. Jackson,

01:12:28.182 --> 01:12:29.750
we found Lil Eric.

01:12:29.784 --> 01:12:31.752
He's at the precinct.

01:12:31.786 --> 01:12:33.854
He's fine.

01:12:35.688 --> 01:12:37.590
What precinct?

01:12:39.927 --> 01:12:42.595
This point
got no damn sense.

01:12:43.964 --> 01:12:45.698
Look, I'm outside
of my jurisdiction,

01:12:45.733 --> 01:12:46.934
so if I go up
in that motherfucker,

01:12:46.967 --> 01:12:48.668
I might not come
out. Okay?

01:12:48.702 --> 01:12:50.905
So, one of y'all got to go in
there and get him.

01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:08.222
There is a time
and place, homie.

01:13:08.255 --> 01:13:09.656
There's a time
and a fucking place.

01:13:09.689 --> 01:13:11.125
Did you find him?

01:13:11.158 --> 01:13:13.260
They'll only release
him to a legal guardian.

01:13:13.294 --> 01:13:15.662
Shit.
What if I'm ain't that?

01:13:15.695 --> 01:13:18.065
So, I just sneak in
to Disney World.

01:13:18.099 --> 01:13:19.800
What the fuck you do
with my car?

01:13:19.834 --> 01:13:22.635
I don't know.
Do I look like Minnie Mouse?

01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:24.171
Now we call Sharea,
she gonna blow this shit

01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:25.906
way out of proportion,
I'm telling y'all now.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:28.742
Well, yeah, we lost
the child.

01:13:31.178 --> 01:13:34.882
Wouldn't want you to die
from second-hand smoke.

01:13:34.915 --> 01:13:37.218
Be free.

01:13:41.088 --> 01:13:42.923
So, did you call his mom yet?

01:13:42.957 --> 01:13:44.191
We don't need
to call them.

01:13:44.225 --> 01:13:47.228
- Why not?
- Because...

01:13:47.261 --> 01:13:50.264
she gonna take that shit
to another level.

01:13:52.933 --> 01:13:55.035
And she gonna overreact,

01:13:55.069 --> 01:13:56.669
and then, she gonna get my momma
blood pressure,

01:13:56.704 --> 01:13:59.940
man, you gonna fucking
piss me off.

01:14:01.075 --> 01:14:02.409
So, who you calling?

01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:07.414
Come here.

01:14:07.448 --> 01:14:09.316
Hey, come here.

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:11.185
No, it's Rachel,

01:14:11.218 --> 01:14:13.354
the girl with the camera.

01:14:13.387 --> 01:14:15.189
I'm Asian.

01:14:15.222 --> 01:14:18.192
Mr. Jackson wanted me
to let Sharea know,

01:14:18.225 --> 01:14:21.228
Lil Eric is perfectly fine.

01:14:21.262 --> 01:14:22.830
He is in jail,

01:14:22.863 --> 01:14:25.799
but he wasn't arrested.

01:14:25.833 --> 01:14:27.034
That nerd try to

01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:28.402
question my damn
parenting skills,

01:14:28.435 --> 01:14:30.704
dud, you gonna take my kid
for one day and leave

01:14:30.738 --> 01:14:32.273
and sit in the car
like he's some kind of animal.

01:14:32.306 --> 01:14:33.874
I think his demon is trying

01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:35.142
to separate us with you, girl.

01:14:35.176 --> 01:14:36.877
It ain't no damn demons, momma,

01:14:36.911 --> 01:14:39.947
we should stop saying that shit.
It ain't nobody but Junior.

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.148
And you don't wanna see
it that way.

01:14:41.182 --> 01:14:42.783
You wanna live in
the make believes.

01:14:42.816 --> 01:14:44.285
I'mma just gonna sip my tea.

01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:46.420
If you're looking for a demon,
his ass right there.

01:14:46.453 --> 01:14:49.890
Jesus, you finish Sharea?

01:14:49.924 --> 01:14:52.459
Don't call me
by my government name, nigga.

01:14:52.493 --> 01:14:54.094
Are you done?

01:14:54.128 --> 01:14:55.930
Are you done?

01:14:55.963 --> 01:14:56.964
- No.
- Are you done?

01:14:56.997 --> 01:15:00.234
Jesus.

01:15:00.267 --> 01:15:02.336
- Check stub please.
- Cheryl...

01:15:02.369 --> 01:15:04.305
- Proof of employment, please.
- No, I got... Cheryl, I got...

01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:06.173
- Check stubs.
- I got them, Cheryl.

01:15:06.207 --> 01:15:07.741
I got them,
but I forgot them.

01:15:07.775 --> 01:15:09.009
Hmm. I know it's always
something with you.

01:15:09.043 --> 01:15:10.444
- No. Cheryl...
- Are you trying to go back

01:15:10.477 --> 01:15:12.012
- to jail, TJ?
- I thought they was in my car.

01:15:12.046 --> 01:15:13.314
But then I realized
that I might...

01:15:13.347 --> 01:15:14.882
You know what, TJ?
Don't play with me today

01:15:14.915 --> 01:15:17.484
because I'm not
in the mood.

01:15:27.394 --> 01:15:29.797
Cheryl.

01:15:31.498 --> 01:15:33.200
Cheryl.

01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:42.009
Cheryl.

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.055
What the fuck you
doing up there?

01:15:55.089 --> 01:15:57.091
- TJ?
- You fucking with that

01:15:57.124 --> 01:15:58.892
- Freddie Mercury-looking nigga?
- Oh, I got your

01:15:58.926 --> 01:16:00.494
- Freddie Mercury right here.
- No, thanks, nigga.

01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:02.363
- I don't do porn.
- Okay. Let me handle this.

01:16:02.396 --> 01:16:04.198
Hey, you better tell that
motherfucker to kick rocks.

01:16:04.231 --> 01:16:05.532
Turn them cameras off.
Turn those cameras off.

01:16:05.566 --> 01:16:07.001
Yeah. Yeah. You know why,

01:16:07.034 --> 01:16:08.535
because she don't
want the world to know

01:16:08.569 --> 01:16:10.371
that she fucking around with
Doug, the Bounty hunter.

01:16:10.404 --> 01:16:11.872
All right.
You about 30 seconds

01:16:11.905 --> 01:16:14.441
- from getting choked out, boy.
- Boy?

01:16:14.475 --> 01:16:16.076
Nigga, we don't in

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:17.544

01:16:17.578 --> 01:16:19.246
- messing with me.
- Hey, listen, wait.

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.115
You better call
will.i.am, nigga,

01:16:21.148 --> 01:16:23.150
ain't the DJ, boy.
I don't play, heard me?

01:16:23.183 --> 01:16:24.518
TJ! What do you want?

01:16:24.551 --> 01:16:26.086
What do you need, TJ?
What do you need?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.521
You wanted... you wanted
proof of employment

01:16:27.554 --> 01:16:30.791
- for the last few weeks, right?
- Yeah.

01:16:34.295 --> 01:16:36.196
You got this push
broom motherfucker

01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:37.598
all off in the crib.

01:16:37.631 --> 01:16:40.167
Motherfucker,
all in his drawers and shit.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.037
TJ.

01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:46.040
You got check stubs?

01:16:46.073 --> 01:16:48.008
Nigga, I'm proud of you.

01:16:48.042 --> 01:16:51.145
I'm proud of you, TJ.

01:16:51.178 --> 01:16:52.946
You can get back
to sling blade now.

01:17:03.924 --> 01:17:05.359
Don't tell nobody
I was in a fight,

01:17:05.392 --> 01:17:07.528
and don't put that shit
in my documentary.

01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:09.229
Why not?

01:17:09.263 --> 01:17:12.166
Because it's a violation
to my parole.

01:17:12.199 --> 01:17:14.168
How long it take for me
to wake up?

01:17:14.201 --> 01:17:16.937
<i>♪ They talk about the
money I talk about the time ♪</i>

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.540

- Watchtower.
- Yeah.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:41.261
What do you think
about that?

01:17:41.295 --> 01:17:43.063
Hey, man. Look, nigga,

01:17:43.097 --> 01:17:45.299
if we gonna take this musical
empire to that next level,

01:17:45.332 --> 01:17:47.501
don't sugarcoat that nigga,
just tell me how you feel.

01:17:47.534 --> 01:17:49.303
You like it or not?

01:17:49.336 --> 01:17:51.338
It was trash,

01:17:51.372 --> 01:17:54.208
- like, hot garbage.
- Man, fuck you, nigga,

01:17:54.241 --> 01:17:55.642
that version was cold than
a can of pussy,

01:17:55.676 --> 01:17:59.680
eat you that shit,
let's do the hood.

01:17:59.714 --> 01:18:01.982
This nigga is
just disrespectful, man.

01:18:02.015 --> 01:18:04.118
Just...

01:18:08.255 --> 01:18:10.524
Hey.
Where the fuck is TJ?

01:18:10.557 --> 01:18:12.059
Fuck.

01:18:12.092 --> 01:18:15.396
Hey, man, I'm gonna drop
for real,

01:18:15.429 --> 01:18:17.097
this shit cold,
watch out, nigga.

01:18:17.131 --> 01:18:18.432
<i>Watchtower.</i>

01:18:18.465 --> 01:18:21.135
<i>Punch it, nigga,
and after the refrain.</i>

01:18:23.036 --> 01:18:24.671
<i>Watchtower.</i>

01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:30.210
Nigga, are you...

01:18:30.244 --> 01:18:31.378
where the fuck he go?

01:18:31.412 --> 01:18:34.181
Watchtower.

01:18:39.052 --> 01:18:40.487
I'm recording vocals.

01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:42.122
I don't give a fuck.

01:18:42.156 --> 01:18:43.290
I don't care
if you're recording

01:18:43.323 --> 01:18:44.992
the national
motherfucker anthem,

01:18:45.025 --> 01:18:47.127
get the fuck out
here, TJ.

01:18:47.161 --> 01:18:49.530
You
your fucking lot.

01:18:51.598 --> 01:18:53.967
<i>My brother is one of the first
niggas from Hollywood, Florida,</i>

01:18:54.001 --> 01:18:56.236
<i>he got arrested on tops</i>

01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.572
and cheaters,

01:18:58.605 --> 01:19:00.607
punch a girl on the face.

01:19:02.342 --> 01:19:04.445
Ever since then,
I've been camera shy.

01:19:04.478 --> 01:19:07.448
You broke my Rolex,
this should cost me $50.

01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:08.515
What is these, TJ?

01:19:08.549 --> 01:19:10.117
I told you.
They check stub.

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.251
They counterfeit stubs.

01:19:11.285 --> 01:19:12.653
I don't know
nothing about that.

01:19:12.686 --> 01:19:14.521
Yes, you do, and why would
you walk off your job?

01:19:14.555 --> 01:19:16.323
You was doing so good,
and you left?

01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:17.759
Get my cigarettes,
it's on my pocket, for me.

01:19:17.792 --> 01:19:20.093
I ain't getting shit.

01:19:20.127 --> 01:19:22.229
Hey, get off
with that cock.

01:19:22.262 --> 01:19:24.732
Hey, take the... you know,
move that cock.

01:19:24.766 --> 01:19:26.266
Y'all get his cock
on camera?

01:19:26.300 --> 01:19:29.269
You about to get a lot
of cock where you going.

01:19:30.471 --> 01:19:32.740
Y'all get his cock?

01:19:34.608 --> 01:19:36.343
All right.

01:19:36.376 --> 01:19:40.347
One second,
but this the last one.

01:19:40.380 --> 01:19:42.049
All right. Look, uh...

01:19:42.082 --> 01:19:43.785
you know, TJ
is... he's a gifted man.

01:19:43.818 --> 01:19:46.453
That's, you know,
that's, that's real,

01:19:46.487 --> 01:19:48.689
but you got to watch him.

01:19:48.723 --> 01:19:50.357
You got to watch him
because you don't know

01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:51.592
what you're gonna get with TJ.

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:53.494
You don't know
if you gonna get...

01:19:53.527 --> 01:19:56.363
if you gonna get sunshine,
or if you gonna get moonshine.

01:19:56.396 --> 01:20:00.100
And the terms
of TJ's parole,

01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:02.804
honestly, for me... for me,

01:20:02.837 --> 01:20:05.606
they're pretty reasonable,
honestly.

01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:08.242
And every day,

01:20:08.275 --> 01:20:09.744
I ask him,
I say the same shit.

01:20:09.777 --> 01:20:13.748
I say, uh, "TJ, you know,
you go to counseling."

01:20:13.781 --> 01:20:15.182
You know what I get?
Legs up.

01:20:15.215 --> 01:20:17.150
Then I say, "Okay.

01:20:17.184 --> 01:20:19.721
What about... what,
about community service?

01:20:19.754 --> 01:20:22.356
Did you go to community service?
Did you do it?"

01:20:22.389 --> 01:20:24.291
"Oh, I'm a soul train."

01:20:24.324 --> 01:20:26.393
"What about work?"

01:20:26.426 --> 01:20:29.062
"Yo, am."

01:20:30.765 --> 01:20:33.267
This nigga.

01:20:34.836 --> 01:20:38.438
Really, the truth is
you just... you can't help a man

01:20:38.472 --> 01:20:40.240
that refused to help himself.

01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:42.576
And that's what I got to know.

01:20:42.609 --> 01:20:46.246
You know, that's...

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.649
that's it.
So, all right.

01:20:52.152 --> 01:20:53.620
And you know
the worst part is that

01:20:53.654 --> 01:20:57.124
I actually believed you.
I believed your down shit.

01:20:57.157 --> 01:20:58.826
Do you ever think about
getting back into music though?

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:00.862
- TJ, do you hear me?
- Have a nigga pump his mixtape?

01:21:00.895 --> 01:21:03.430
Counterfeit is a serious
offense. This is real.

01:21:03.463 --> 01:21:05.532
Affirmation
music Volume 1.

01:21:05.566 --> 01:21:07.200
Hey, you know what,
hey, he came back.

01:21:07.234 --> 01:21:08.535
You know
what his cock.

01:21:08.569 --> 01:21:10.404
Hey, homie, let me get you
with your cock, homie.

01:21:10.437 --> 01:21:11.538
Hey, hey

01:21:11.572 --> 01:21:13.307
So get your dog off
to prison can,

01:21:13.340 --> 01:21:15.175
and this is the things
I get from you?

01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:16.443
Okay. Cool.

01:21:16.476 --> 01:21:18.278
- I can't.
- You call the cops on a nigga.

01:21:18.312 --> 01:21:19.847
- I ain't doing it no more.
- Cheryl, you call the laws

01:21:19.881 --> 01:21:22.649
- on a nigga, though?
- Hey, get him.

01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:10.664
Tell me the truth,
and I can help you.

01:22:10.697 --> 01:22:12.633
Or you're going back inside.

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:15.302
We have not used since
we got out.

01:22:15.335 --> 01:22:17.537
We have two months
to give up in life.

01:22:17.571 --> 01:22:18.906
I haven't

01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.574
- I don't know what...
- Okay. So...

01:22:20.607 --> 01:22:22.209
- All the respect, man.
- So you both clean?

01:22:22.242 --> 01:22:23.543
- A hundred percent.
- A hundred percent.

01:22:23.577 --> 01:22:24.746
- A hundred percent.
- Absolutely.

01:22:24.779 --> 01:22:26.213
I'm on

01:22:26.246 --> 01:22:27.715
Okay. Okay.

01:22:27.749 --> 01:22:29.751
I'm giving you one last chance
and tell me the truth,

01:22:29.784 --> 01:22:31.451
or you both taking
the piss tests.

01:22:31.485 --> 01:22:33.821
Give me a tiny little
meth on the weekends,

01:22:33.855 --> 01:22:35.689
or it's fine.
Nothing serious.

01:22:35.723 --> 01:22:37.591
Don't look at him,
look at me.

01:22:37.624 --> 01:22:40.594
He's not the one
that's gonna book you, I am.

01:22:45.399 --> 01:22:47.267
You ain't talk to him?

01:22:48.703 --> 01:22:51.939
Well, I'm not surprised.

01:22:51.973 --> 01:22:53.507
You know
what to do with these?

01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:54.641
Cheryl.

01:22:54.675 --> 01:22:57.979
Do you know what
to do with those?

01:22:58.012 --> 01:22:59.212
Okay.

01:23:03.951 --> 01:23:05.552
Goodbye.

01:23:37.384 --> 01:23:38.318
Hey, watch out.

01:23:38.351 --> 01:23:40.021
Oh, shit, he saw us.

01:23:40.054 --> 01:23:41.756
Why didn't you tell me
you were out?

01:23:41.789 --> 01:23:43.490
I think the more distance
between you and me,

01:23:43.523 --> 01:23:45.358
- the better off you gonna be.
- How did you figure that?

01:23:45.392 --> 01:23:47.729
Watch your tone
with me now, boy.

01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:49.396
Why didn't you call?

01:23:50.798 --> 01:23:52.299
- Because Lil Eric...
- Because what?

01:23:52.332 --> 01:23:53.735
Because your momma
keep making this thing

01:23:53.768 --> 01:23:54.902
like everything
was my fault.

01:23:54.936 --> 01:23:56.636
But it was your fault.

01:23:56.670 --> 01:23:57.939
The first night
you came home,

01:23:57.972 --> 01:23:59.306
there was no one
in the house

01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:00.574
so you had to sleep
in the car.

01:24:00.607 --> 01:24:01.743
What did I do?

01:24:01.776 --> 01:24:03.343
I came out to sleep
in the car too

01:24:03.376 --> 01:24:04.712
because I didn't want you
to be out there

01:24:04.746 --> 01:24:05.913
all by yourself.

01:24:05.947 --> 01:24:07.380
But as soon as we get
to the contest,

01:24:07.414 --> 01:24:08.482
what did you do?

01:24:08.515 --> 01:24:09.751
You told me
to wait in the car

01:24:09.784 --> 01:24:11.451
all by myself for some stupid

01:24:11.485 --> 01:24:13.587
Toastmaster thing
that turned out to be...

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.689
But what you ain't even
realizing is that great success

01:24:15.723 --> 01:24:18.391
- requires great sacrifice. I...
- Great success?

01:24:18.425 --> 01:24:20.594
If the only one benefitting
from it is you,

01:24:20.627 --> 01:24:22.596
how great can it be?

01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.010
Oh, whose bike is that?

01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:41.348
Boy.

01:24:41.381 --> 01:24:42.884
You gotta rinse it before
you put it up under the bed.

01:24:47.889 --> 01:24:49.322
Put it down.

01:24:49.356 --> 01:24:50.825
Put it down now.

01:25:09.043 --> 01:25:11.611
Oh, why are you
so skinny, boy?

01:25:11.645 --> 01:25:13.014
I've been riding my bicycle,
Momma.

01:25:13.047 --> 01:25:14.849
Oh.

01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:31.999
I saw this blog
and it said that...

01:25:33.134 --> 01:25:34.534
...this was good
for the arthritis.

01:25:35.837 --> 01:25:37.738
- You okay, Momma?
- Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

01:25:37.772 --> 01:25:38.739
- Ooh.
- Okay.

01:25:39.907 --> 01:25:42.877
So, what
exactly are you interested in?

01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:43.911
Like, what's your passion?

01:25:43.945 --> 01:25:46.479
What do you wanna do?

01:25:46.513 --> 01:25:48.648
I wanna be a public speaker
like my uncle.

01:25:48.682 --> 01:25:50.483
Hmm. Okay.

01:25:50.517 --> 01:25:52.519
So, then we need to look
at your transcripts,

01:25:52.552 --> 01:25:55.122
let's see what courses
that you already took.

01:25:55.156 --> 01:25:57.124
I see you
took time to speak,

01:25:57.158 --> 01:25:58.658
and you're
in regular English.

01:25:58.692 --> 01:26:00.493
Maybe you should get
into English AP

01:26:00.527 --> 01:26:03.030
to kind of learn grammar.

01:26:03.064 --> 01:26:04.531
Legs up.

01:26:04.564 --> 01:26:06.433
- Okay.
- <i>Listen.</i>

01:26:06.466 --> 01:26:08.169
If you put a black woman's
baby in danger,

01:26:08.202 --> 01:26:11.138
she gonna go from zero
to Remy real quick.

01:26:11.172 --> 01:26:13.975
And if I'm being honest,
TJ has been more of a father

01:26:14.008 --> 01:26:17.544
to little Eric
than my baby daddy ever was.

01:26:17.577 --> 01:26:18.913
Now, he ain't perfect,

01:26:18.946 --> 01:26:21.082
but he's trying.

01:26:21.115 --> 01:26:22.717
Oh.

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:26.954
Um, I only had two prayers.

01:26:26.988 --> 01:26:29.790
One was to see
my family unified

01:26:29.824 --> 01:26:31.424
under the blood of Jesus.

01:26:31.458 --> 01:26:32.727
Praise the Lord.

01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:36.496
What's the other one,
Momma?

01:26:36.529 --> 01:26:38.799
A big house
with a pool

01:26:38.833 --> 01:26:42.970
so that we can
live together comfortably.

01:26:43.004 --> 01:26:44.105
But as long
as we're together,

01:26:44.138 --> 01:26:45.505
I don't need no pool.

01:26:45.538 --> 01:26:47.174
I do.

01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:48.642
- Listen now...
- Oh, shut up, boy.

01:26:48.675 --> 01:26:50.577
"I do."

01:26:54.547 --> 01:26:57.484
- Here we go.
- Ooh. Yes.

01:26:57.517 --> 01:26:59.586
Yeah,
that's what I'm talking about.

01:26:59.619 --> 01:27:01.521
Y'all put down
your cameras and come here.

01:27:01.554 --> 01:27:03.090
- Come on.
- Is it enough for now?

01:27:03.124 --> 01:27:05.226
Seriously?

01:27:05.259 --> 01:27:07.028
Y'all stop acting up now.

01:27:07.061 --> 01:27:09.030
Yes, ma'am.

01:27:12.532 --> 01:27:16.503
Lord, we ask you
to bless this food,

01:27:16.536 --> 01:27:18.806
and we ask you to bless
the white people

01:27:18.839 --> 01:27:20.174
at this table.

01:27:20.207 --> 01:27:21.242
Amen.

01:27:21.275 --> 01:27:23.044
- Amen.
- All right.

01:27:23.077 --> 01:27:24.644
Y'all, let's eat for real
and stop playing, okay?

01:27:24.678 --> 01:27:26.080
What's wrong with the forks,

01:27:26.113 --> 01:27:27.982
why I gotta stick me up...
oh, Lord, Jesus.

01:27:28.015 --> 01:27:29.649
<i>Let me tell y'all
something, man.</i>

01:27:29.683 --> 01:27:31.018
<i>One thing my nephew
I would like to call it</i>

01:27:31.052 --> 01:27:32.987
<i>my little guru
made me realize is</i>

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.722
<i>the whole point
of being a life coach</i>

01:27:34.755 --> 01:27:36.157
<i>is to help others, you know?</i>

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:38.993
<i>Mainly my family
and my community,</i>

01:27:39.026 --> 01:27:40.962
<i>heard me.</i>

01:27:40.995 --> 01:27:45.266
<i>and there's a lot of people
out there winning the rat race.</i>

01:27:45.299 --> 01:27:47.034
<i>Then what's a million dollars
to a slave</i>

01:27:47.068 --> 01:27:49.602
<i>if he can't buy
his own freedom, you heard?</i>

01:27:49.636 --> 01:27:52.539
<i>She own
the tall white boy</i>

01:27:52.572 --> 01:27:54.008
<i>with the big carwash mustache.</i>

01:27:54.041 --> 01:27:55.810
He's already
been asked to resign.

01:27:55.843 --> 01:27:57.111
What up, Levaughn?

01:27:57.144 --> 01:27:58.245
Levaughn?

01:27:58.279 --> 01:28:01.681
What up, nigga?

01:28:01.716 --> 01:28:02.984
Yes, ma'am.

01:28:03.017 --> 01:28:06.787
Boy, what happenin',

01:28:06.821 --> 01:28:09.256
I here because I care
about y'all.

01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:11.826
Tune, as far as I'm concerned,

01:28:11.859 --> 01:28:14.594
someone fucked up
on their life already.

01:28:14.627 --> 01:28:16.130
But me, for me,

01:28:16.163 --> 01:28:18.265
I was a master
fuck-up-ist.

01:28:18.299 --> 01:28:19.566
And this man
changed my life.

01:28:19.599 --> 01:28:21.168
So that it could change yours.

01:28:21.202 --> 01:28:23.536
It's just a matter of listenin'
and paying attention, you know.

01:28:23.570 --> 01:28:24.939
a matter of
paying attention.

01:28:24.972 --> 01:28:27.607
I'm... yo, fucking
pay attention, now man,

01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:29.710
because every time so,
but yo,

01:28:29.744 --> 01:28:31.979
I want to bring
my brethren right now,

01:28:32.013 --> 01:28:33.014
no other than

01:28:33.047 --> 01:28:34.982
Tijuana Jackson.

01:28:35.016 --> 01:28:37.084
Yeah. Give it up
for my homie, Upgrade.

01:28:37.118 --> 01:28:38.152
You know what I'm saying.

01:28:38.185 --> 01:28:39.787
That's Toucan fam
right there.

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:43.224
It's Toucan fam,
real nigga shit, heard me.

01:28:43.257 --> 01:28:45.760
I didn't get it.

01:28:45.793 --> 01:28:47.328
Took getting cursed out
by my nephew,

01:28:47.361 --> 01:28:50.197
I call him my guru,
Lil Eric,

01:28:50.231 --> 01:28:51.732
to realize that
my success would come

01:28:51.766 --> 01:28:53.701
from being selfless,

01:28:53.734 --> 01:28:55.036
not selfish.

01:28:55.069 --> 01:28:57.138
Uh-hmm.

01:28:57.171 --> 01:28:59.040
Because when you got
a sense of purpose,

01:28:59.073 --> 01:29:02.109
you gotta service
more than just you.

01:29:03.676 --> 01:29:05.713
Oh, y'all didn't think
I would get that deep, huh?

01:29:05.746 --> 01:29:07.181
Well, hold on, niggas,

01:29:07.214 --> 01:29:09.682
because I'm deep
like giraffe pussy.

01:29:09.717 --> 01:29:11.285
And what if I told you

01:29:11.318 --> 01:29:15.122
that every nigga in here
got a purpose?

01:29:15.156 --> 01:29:19.794
And that purpose stems from
one moment in your damn life?

01:29:19.827 --> 01:29:22.863
I'm in my one moment like
the shit happened yesterday.

01:29:22.897 --> 01:29:25.665
- Uh-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:29:25.698 --> 01:29:27.268
When I was 13 years old,

01:29:27.301 --> 01:29:30.004
my uncle tried
to put his finger

01:29:30.037 --> 01:29:31.739
in my asshole
while I was asleep,

01:29:31.772 --> 01:29:34.275
but I caught him.

01:29:34.308 --> 01:29:35.810
Took about seven hours
of surgery

01:29:35.843 --> 01:29:37.677
to get my foot out
of his fucking larynx,

01:29:37.711 --> 01:29:40.613
fucked that nigga
voice box up good.

01:29:41.849 --> 01:29:45.386
To this day when he talks,
he sound like...

01:29:45.419 --> 01:29:47.822
uh, what's the name
of the, uh...

01:29:47.855 --> 01:29:49.190
What?

01:29:49.223 --> 01:29:50.958
What's the name
of the big old buff nigga

01:29:50.991 --> 01:29:53.327
with the raspy voice who used
to win all the Grammys?

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:55.996
Uh, Big strong nigga used
to work out back in the 90s?

01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:58.065
Had all the hit...
Macy Gray,

01:29:58.099 --> 01:29:59.133
he sound
like that nigga.

01:29:59.166 --> 01:30:00.334
Quiet!

01:30:00.367 --> 01:30:01.735
Y'all go ahead and laugh,

01:30:01.769 --> 01:30:02.903
but that's why
I brought up my uncle

01:30:02.937 --> 01:30:04.738
<i>and his big-ass fingers.</i>

01:30:04.772 --> 01:30:08.675
<i>Your pain should be
the pathway to your purpose.</i>

01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:11.278
<i>So when y'all get up
out these blocks,</i>

01:30:11.312 --> 01:30:13.047
<i>don't seek success.</i>

01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:14.815
<i>Seek purpose,</i>

01:30:14.849 --> 01:30:16.750
<i>and let success find you.</i>

01:30:16.784 --> 01:30:18.919
<i>Because success,</i>

01:30:18.953 --> 01:30:21.088
<i>that's just an illusion.</i>

01:30:21.122 --> 01:30:22.655
<i>Purpose,</i>

01:30:22.689 --> 01:30:24.325
<i>that's the motherfucking
conclusion,</i>

01:30:24.358 --> 01:30:25.826
<i>heard me?</i>

01:30:33.901 --> 01:30:36.103
I take it you two
are in good terms again?

01:30:36.137 --> 01:30:37.771
Well, uh, we, uh...

01:30:37.805 --> 01:30:39.907
we have... we have
an understanding.

01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:41.842
Any plans
for the future?

01:30:41.876 --> 01:30:44.345
Well, I mean, for me,
you know,

01:30:44.378 --> 01:30:45.980
I just believe that
if you gonna be a life coach,

01:30:46.013 --> 01:30:47.414
you gotta be a life coach 24/7

01:30:47.448 --> 01:30:49.783
because life is a full-time job,
you know?

01:30:49.817 --> 01:30:51.285
So you don't get
no off days on life,

01:30:51.318 --> 01:30:53.220
and once this Prison Logic
take off,

01:30:53.254 --> 01:30:54.955
you know,
phone gonna be ringing like

01:30:54.989 --> 01:30:56.357
the second hand, heard me?

01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:58.325
You know,
like the second hand

01:30:58.359 --> 01:30:59.860
because the second hand
go around the clock.

01:30:59.894 --> 01:31:01.795
Why you always
gotta speak in parables?

01:31:01.829 --> 01:31:03.797
You know, I'mma need travel
permits once this shit take off?

01:31:03.831 --> 01:31:04.965
I'll think about it.

01:31:04.999 --> 01:31:06.267
What you mean
you gonna think about it?

01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:10.004
Do you need me to speak
in parables, too?

01:32:04.925 --> 01:32:06.493
- Drop me.
- I got you.

01:32:06.527 --> 01:32:08.996
Well done.

01:32:09.029 --> 01:32:11.131
I should have you
train my staff.

01:32:11.165 --> 01:32:13.067
I do the same thing,
but this old nigga in the joint,

01:32:13.100 --> 01:32:14.468
used to have to put him
on the toilet

01:32:14.501 --> 01:32:15.970
and put stool out of
whenever

01:32:16.003 --> 01:32:19.940
they fed us
that nutraloaf.

01:32:19.974 --> 01:32:21.875
I remember TJ saying to me

01:32:21.909 --> 01:32:23.510
excuse me, Mr. Jackson

01:32:23.544 --> 01:32:26.847
saying to me when I was going
through my divorce,

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:30.217
"Sam," and I quote,

01:32:30.251 --> 01:32:32.820
"You too good
for that chicken-head skank.

01:32:32.853 --> 01:32:34.555
She be creeping."

01:32:34.588 --> 01:32:36.490
And I knew exactly
what he meant.

01:32:36.523 --> 01:32:39.860
May I see your license
and registration, please?

01:32:43.864 --> 01:32:45.532
Fuck, he's acting out,

01:32:45.566 --> 01:32:47.968
nigga, look like

01:32:48.002 --> 01:32:50.004
any time you all need me,
just call that number.

01:32:50.037 --> 01:32:51.472
Are you guys
filming something?

01:32:51.505 --> 01:32:53.240
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what's that about?

01:32:53.274 --> 01:32:54.341
About my life.
It's about...

01:32:54.375 --> 01:32:56.810
Well, I'm a filmmaker, too.

01:32:56.844 --> 01:32:58.245
It does nothing
for a nigga's self-esteem

01:32:58.279 --> 01:32:59.513
when you got
a bigger motherfucker

01:32:59.546 --> 01:33:01.248
twice your size
and put on the condom.

01:33:01.282 --> 01:33:03.584
You wanna get honest
about it.

01:33:04.952 --> 01:33:05.986
You okay, Momma?

01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:11.125
TJ, stop!

01:33:14.428 --> 01:33:15.896
I'm about to hit a funny bone.

01:33:15.929 --> 01:33:18.032
S-U-I-C-I-D-E.

01:33:18.065 --> 01:33:19.400
Suicide.

01:33:19.433 --> 01:33:23.103
Because Sharea is an unhappy
individual committed

01:33:23.137 --> 01:33:26.340
to the immediate demise
of my endeavors.

01:33:26.373 --> 01:33:28.242
Suicide.

01:33:35.549 --> 01:33:37.985
I need to go out and get
the okay.

01:33:38.018 --> 01:33:39.520
I'm gonna get
the back leg.

01:33:39.553 --> 01:33:41.388
I'm gonna get
the finger pop.

01:33:41.422 --> 01:33:42.456
I'm gonna get
the dungarees,

01:33:42.489 --> 01:33:44.425
I want no clean up.

01:33:49.563 --> 01:33:51.031
It shouldn't take this long

01:33:51.065 --> 01:33:53.634
to hand out some flyers.

01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:50.752
<i>Well, at one point,
did you say to yourself,</i>

01:35:50.785 --> 01:35:52.453
"We have a hit documentary
on our hands"?

01:35:52.486 --> 01:35:53.454
At no point.

01:35:53.487 --> 01:35:55.322
Oh, I thought
right away.

01:35:55.355 --> 01:35:56.657
Well, it started out
as a class assignment,

01:35:56.690 --> 01:35:58.492
just a 10-minute short,
but...

01:35:58.525 --> 01:36:00.594
Yeah. But then Tijuana
inspired us to make it like a...

01:36:00.627 --> 01:36:02.362
like a
whole documentary.

01:36:02.396 --> 01:36:03.564
How did you do that?

01:36:03.597 --> 01:36:05.165
Well,
he made us see that whether

01:36:05.199 --> 01:36:06.533
it's a class assignment,

01:36:06.567 --> 01:36:09.036
family engagement,
community service,

01:36:09.069 --> 01:36:10.504
what's most often
asked of us

01:36:10.537 --> 01:36:12.573
is the bare minimum.
It's up to us to do more.

01:36:12.606 --> 01:36:13.741
Hey, you always
gotta give credit

01:36:13.775 --> 01:36:16.276
- to the white folks.
- I'm not white.

01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:17.678
And you were in prison
when we filmed this.

01:36:17.712 --> 01:36:19.613
Yeah. They only wanna
interview you.

01:36:19.646 --> 01:36:20.614
Man, just drink your juice.

01:36:20.647 --> 01:36:21.615
That's okay, though.

01:36:21.648 --> 01:36:22.649
Who got the book deal

01:36:22.683 --> 01:36:23.751
and the merchandising deal?

01:36:23.785 --> 01:36:25.285
- Matter of fact...
- Oh...

01:36:25.319 --> 01:36:26.687
...mixtape out too,
cop that.

01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:28.388
Why are you being
a little dramatic?

01:36:28.422 --> 01:36:30.157
Don't you... uh-uh, don't you
lit that up down here.

01:36:30.190 --> 01:36:31.592
- That's okay, momma.
- They really want it.

01:36:31.625 --> 01:36:33.026
Y'all do the
pretty tiddy-diddy,

01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:34.461
I won't get the keys
to the city now.

01:36:34.495 --> 01:36:35.629
- Why y'all over this?
- But it was good, right?

01:36:35.662 --> 01:36:36.764
You're too close.
Get in the back.

01:36:36.798 --> 01:36:37.431
momma.
