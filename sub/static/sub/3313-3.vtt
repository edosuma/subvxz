WEBVTT

00:07.578 --> 00:09.610
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.713
FULL-DAY BUDGET HEARING.
( groans )

00:13.714 --> 00:17.147
DO YOU KNOW HOW TIRING IT IS TO ACT
LIKE YOU'RE LISTENING ALL DAY LONG?

00:17.148 --> 00:18.718
"MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.520
REALLY? OH."

00:20.521 --> 00:23.623
BUT BY AND LARGE YOU LIKE YOUR
JOB DOWN AT CITY HALL, RIGHT?

00:23.624 --> 00:26.426
YEAH, I MEAN, EVERYONE HOLDS
THE ELEVATOR DOOR FOR ME,

00:26.427 --> 00:29.299
AND JUST LIKE BATMAN, I GET TO
SAY I'M FRIENDS WITH THE MAYOR.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.261
SO IT WOULD EVEN BE A GOOD PLACE
TO WORK PART-TIME, RIGHT?

00:31.262 --> 00:34.264
- I THINK I FORGOT MY PURSE IN THE CAR.
- WHAT'S THAT ON YOUR ARM?

00:34.265 --> 00:36.736
OH, I THINK I FORGOT
SOMETHING ELSE IN THE CAR.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.369
YEAH, MAYBE YOU FORGOT TO TELL ME
THAT A PART-TIME JOB OPENED UP

00:39.370 --> 00:40.740
IN THE TOLEDO
CONTROLLER'S OFFICE.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.243
- IT'S NOT THE RIGHT JOB FOR YOU, JOE.
- AHA!

00:43.244 --> 00:45.615
- SO YOU DID KNOW ABOUT IT.
- ARE YOU LOOKING FOR WORK BEHIND MY BACK?

00:45.616 --> 00:48.149
APPARENTLY THAT'S
WHERE THE JOBS ARE.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.681
IT'S PAPER PUSHING.
YOU'D BE LOOKING FOR

00:51.682 --> 00:54.684
BUDGET REDUCTIONS AND REDUNDANCIES.
IT'S NOT SEXY.

00:54.685 --> 00:58.488
AND HOSING BIRD POOP OFF
YOUR MAILBOX, THAT'S SEXY?

00:58.489 --> 01:00.790
IT IS WHEN YOU DO IT.

01:00.791 --> 01:03.463
LOOK, AND BESIDES YOU'RE HAPPY HERE.
SO VERY HAPPY!

01:03.464 --> 01:06.536
HAPPINESS REQUIRES PERSONAL FULFILLMENT
AND A LITTLE SELF-RESPECT.

01:06.537 --> 01:10.069
- MM-HMM MM-HMM.
- AND I JUST, DON'T REALLY THINK THAT I'M GETTING THAT HERE.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.402
- REALLY? OH.
- WILL YOU KNOCK THAT OFF?!

01:12.403 --> 01:15.545
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. IT'S
TRUE I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

01:15.546 --> 01:17.547
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU
APPLY FOR THAT JOB,

01:17.548 --> 01:19.809
ALL THAT SCANLON BUSINESS IS
GONNA COME RIGHT BACK UP.

01:19.810 --> 01:23.153
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO SEE YOU
PUBLICLY EMBARRASSED AGAIN.

01:23.154 --> 01:26.116
BURKE, I'M A MALE NANNY WHO HOSES
BIRD POOP OFF YOUR MAILBOX.

01:26.117 --> 01:28.758
I THINK I'M PAST THE WHOLE
EMBARRASSMENT THING.

01:28.759 --> 01:31.221
ALL RIGHT, JUST GET ME IN
THE ROOM FOR THE INTERVIEW.

01:31.222 --> 01:33.823
- WHO MAKES THE DECISION?
- WELL, THERE'S A COMMITTEE OF SEVEN PEOPLE,

01:33.824 --> 01:36.266
- BUT REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO TWO.
- OKAY, WHO ARE THEY?

01:36.267 --> 01:39.269
- GIVE ME THEIR NAMES.
- WELL, THERE'S PAUL WAGNER

01:39.270 --> 01:41.100
AND SOME OTHER PERSON.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.474
- OKAY, WHO?
- UH, SOME LADY.

01:44.475 --> 01:46.506
I DON'T KNOW...

01:46.507 --> 01:48.679
ME.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.681
( theme music playing )

01:51.682 --> 01:53.343

01:53.344 --> 01:55.145

02:11.762 --> 02:13.603
SO YOU'RE ONE OF TWO
PEOPLE THAT MAKE THE CALL

02:13.604 --> 02:16.506
ON A JOB THAT I AM UNBELIEVABLY QUALIFIED
FOR AND YET YOU KEPT IT FROM ME.

02:16.507 --> 02:19.739
HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
NURSING THIS WOUND, JOE?

02:19.740 --> 02:21.471
IT'S BEEN ONE MINUTE.

02:21.472 --> 02:24.614
EXACTLY. IT'S TIME TO MOVE ON.

02:24.615 --> 02:26.746
DID YOU SAY DINNER?

02:26.747 --> 02:28.779
NO.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.152
- COULD YOU SAY DINNER?
- NO.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.824
BUT I WILL SAY THIS,
YOUR AUNT COULD HAVE

02:34.825 --> 02:36.786
PUT ME UP FOR THIS REALLY
GREAT JOB AND SHE DIDN'T.

02:36.787 --> 02:39.729
- WHAT'S UP WITH THAT, AUNT MEL?
- WHAT? IT'S A PART-TIME THINGY.

02:39.730 --> 02:41.791
AND WORSE IT'LL TAKE YOUR
TUTOR AWAY FROM YOU.

02:41.792 --> 02:42.862
( sarcastically ) OH NO.

02:42.863 --> 02:45.435
MY HARD-ASS TEACHER WILL BE
IN MY FACE A WHOLE LOT LESS.

02:45.436 --> 02:47.597
BOO-FREAKING-HOO.

02:47.598 --> 02:48.898
WELL, THE KIDS ARE ON BOARD.

02:48.899 --> 02:50.640
YEAH, WHY ARE STANDING
IN JOE'S WAY?

02:50.641 --> 02:52.502
FINE. I'LL GET YOU
THE INTERVIEW.

02:52.503 --> 02:55.345
THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU, GUYS. IT'S
NICE TO KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MY BACK.

02:55.346 --> 02:58.648
SURE. YOU DESERVE A CRACK AT AN
IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT-LEVEL JOB

02:58.649 --> 03:01.481
THAT FULLY UTILIZES YOUR
EXECUTIVE SKILL SET.

03:01.482 --> 03:02.812
HM-MM, I TOTALLY AGREE.

03:02.813 --> 03:04.785
NOW CAN YOU MANAGE SOME DINNER?

03:07.688 --> 03:09.519
YOU KNOW I START
REHEARSALS TOMORROW?

03:09.520 --> 03:10.720
UH-HUH.

03:10.721 --> 03:12.822
IT'S THE PLAY WHERE I'M
KISSING ANOTHER BOY.

03:12.823 --> 03:15.194
SO JUST MAKING SURE YOU
DON'T FREAK OUT ABOUT IT.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.267
THIS GUY... NOT WORRIED.

03:17.268 --> 03:19.729
IT'S ARCHER ADAMS. NOT MY
TYPE, BUT THE SCHOOL BLOG

03:19.730 --> 03:22.972
NAMED HIM SEXIEST UPPERCLASSMAN,
NON-JOCK CATEGORY.

03:22.973 --> 03:25.335
YEAH, I JUST KNOW
YOU'RE DOING THE PLAY

03:25.336 --> 03:27.777
TO BROADEN YOURSELF AS A
WRITER, NOT TO KISS SOME GUY.

03:27.778 --> 03:30.710
SPEAKING OF KISSING A GUY, WHAT
ARE WE DOING THIS WEEKEND?

03:30.711 --> 03:33.212
I NEED TO BREAK IN THIS
NEW WATERMELON LIP GLOSS.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.544
OOH. WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

03:34.545 --> 03:36.886
I'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO
ON MY ART-SCHOOL PORTFOLIO.

03:36.887 --> 03:39.819
HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
BEAUTIFUL SPOT AT TOLEDO BEACH

03:39.820 --> 03:42.522
- WE WENT FOR OUR FIRST DATE?
- OH, HOW COULD I FORGET?

03:42.523 --> 03:45.396
I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN ALL
THE SAND OUT OF MY... EAR.

03:47.398 --> 03:48.828
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

03:48.829 --> 03:50.701
I'M GOING BACK THERE
TO DRAW ROCKS.

03:58.769 --> 04:00.810
UH-OH. NO, I CAN'T BE
THE FIRST ONE HERE.

04:00.811 --> 04:03.513
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
I'M ON YOUR SIDE.

04:03.514 --> 04:05.244
AREN'T YOU ON MY SIDE?

04:05.245 --> 04:08.678
WELL YES, BUT SECRETLY,
WHICH MAKES IT EVEN BETTER.

04:08.679 --> 04:10.780
SHH, YAY JOE.

04:10.781 --> 04:13.583
RELAX, BURKE, I'M GONNA KNOCK
THIS INTERVIEW OUT OF THE PARK.

04:13.584 --> 04:14.784
I'VE ALREADY GONE
THROUGH FIVE YEARS

04:14.785 --> 04:16.756
OF THESE CITY BUDGETS AND
I'VE GOT A LOT OF IDEAS.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.628
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

04:18.629 --> 04:20.760
REALLY?

04:20.761 --> 04:24.263
WHAT? THAT WAS TOTALLY SINCERE.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.735
UH... THANK YOU SO MUCH

04:25.736 --> 04:27.737
FOR JOINING US TODAY, MR.
LONGOW.

04:27.738 --> 04:30.500
AM I PRONOUNCING THAT CORRECTLY?

04:30.501 --> 04:32.502
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN TODAY.

04:32.503 --> 04:34.043
IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'M JOE LONGO.

04:34.044 --> 04:36.706
YEAH. I CAN READ.

04:36.707 --> 04:38.778
LOOK, WE NEED SOMEBODY
WITH A SHARP EYE

04:38.779 --> 04:40.980
WHO CAN SPOT
INEFFICIENCIES AND WASTE.

04:40.981 --> 04:44.053
WELL, I'VE ALREADY ISOLATED FOUR
AREAS OF BUDGET REDUNDANCY.

04:44.054 --> 04:45.815
IT'S SOMETHING I LIKE TO CALL

04:45.816 --> 04:47.717
THE LONGO INITIATIVE
FOR COST CUTTING,

04:47.718 --> 04:50.620
OR "LICK."

04:50.621 --> 04:53.423
THE PROBLEM I SEE WITH YOU

04:53.424 --> 04:55.995
IS THAT THERE'S NO
CONTROLLER EXPERIENCE.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.727
NOTHING. ZIP.

04:57.728 --> 04:59.769
NOW WHERE DID WE GET THIS GUY?

04:59.770 --> 05:02.572
( clears throat )

05:02.573 --> 05:04.534
YOU KNOW IF I CAN JUST
COUNTER THAT BY SAYING

05:04.535 --> 05:07.377
THAT MY VAST EXPERIENCE IN THE PRIVATE
SECTOR HAS MORE THAN QUALIFIED...

05:07.378 --> 05:09.379
WAIT A MINUTE... JOE LONGO.

05:09.380 --> 05:11.811
AREN'T YOU THE GUY FROM
THAT FINANCIAL SCANDAL?

05:11.812 --> 05:14.414
THAT WAS YOUR CROOKED
BROTHER-IN-LAW, RIGHT, BURKE?

05:14.415 --> 05:15.745
WAS IT? HUH.

05:15.746 --> 05:17.717
WHAT DO YOU KNOW? I
GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:17.718 --> 05:21.851
UM, LOOK, I... I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH THAT MALFEASANCE THAT OCCURRED.

05:21.852 --> 05:23.593
W-W... WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.

05:23.594 --> 05:25.895
- YOU'RE WORKING FOR BURKE NOW?
- LET ME SEE THAT.

05:25.896 --> 05:27.797
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE GONNA...

05:27.798 --> 05:30.660
YES INDEEDY. HE WORKS FOR ME.

05:30.661 --> 05:33.332
I'M HER EXECUTIVE...

05:33.333 --> 05:35.565
DIRECTOR OF, UM...

05:35.566 --> 05:37.006
HOUSEHOLD AFFAIRS.

05:37.007 --> 05:39.809
SO YOU DO HAVE EXPERIENCE
WITH GOVERNMENT,

05:39.810 --> 05:41.671
JUST INDIRECTLY.

05:41.672 --> 05:43.813
NOW DO YOU TRUST THIS
GUY IN YOUR HOUSE?

05:43.814 --> 05:46.716
- YEAH, I DO.
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

05:46.717 --> 05:47.977
YOU'RE HIRED, LONGO.

05:47.978 --> 05:51.350
IN JOBS LIKE THIS
IT'S ALL ABOUT TRUST.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.853
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:54.024 --> 05:56.387
THANK YOU.

05:57.588 --> 05:59.789
THIS HERE'S OUR LAST
THREE FISCAL YEARS.

05:59.790 --> 06:01.591
YOU KNOW, JUST GO ON
AND DO YOUR THING.

06:01.592 --> 06:04.363
LICK IT.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.395
HAPPY TO.

06:05.396 --> 06:06.796
DID YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE?

06:06.797 --> 06:08.698
MY TRUSTING YOU
GOT YOU THIS JOB.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.840
THE JOB YOU WEREN'T
GONNA TELL ME ABOUT?

06:10.841 --> 06:13.673
YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO LEARN
TO LET THINGS GO, JOE.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.376
NOW GET CRACKING ON THAT MOUNTAIN
OF PAPERWORK. GO SUCK IT.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.809
LICK IT.

06:19.810 --> 06:20.711
WHATEVER.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.919
OH, ALEJANDRO, I
SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.521
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

06:31.522 --> 06:34.724
NO STAY. EVERY MOMENT APART
FROM YOU IS A THOUSAND YEARS.

06:34.725 --> 06:37.166
EVERY STEP AWAY FROM YOU
IS A THOUSAND MILES.

06:37.167 --> 06:39.098
- KISS ME!
- NO.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.432
MY FATHER'S IN THE CARRIAGE HOUSE
AND WILL MOST CERTAINLY SEE US.

06:42.433 --> 06:45.035
I DON'T CARE. I MUST
HAVE YOUR LIPS.

06:50.681 --> 06:52.642
THAT WAS GREAT.

06:52.643 --> 06:55.045
- IT WAS.
- UH-HUH.

06:56.587 --> 06:59.519
THIS IS LOOKING VERY GOOD.
THE WRITER IS VERY HAPPY.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.551
THANK YOU, LIZBETH. JUST
MAKING YOUR WORDS COME ALIVE.

07:01.552 --> 07:03.953
OKAY, WELL, LET'S RUN THAT
AGAIN WHILE IT'S STILL FRESH.

07:03.954 --> 07:05.925
I DON'T MIND.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.156
ME EITHER.

07:07.157 --> 07:08.929
AND... ACTION.

07:11.662 --> 07:13.803
THE SCENE, LENNOX, I
MEANT THE WHOLE SCENE.

07:13.804 --> 07:16.566
OH, OF COURSE. YES, WORDS.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.509
WORDS ARE VERY GOOD TOO.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.613
SO LOOK WHAT I HAD
FLOWN IN JUST FOR JOE.

07:23.614 --> 07:25.875
MIGNONA'S FAMOUS
FROM JERSEY CITY.

07:25.876 --> 07:27.046
YEAH.

07:27.047 --> 07:30.720
SO WE CAN FLY IN PIZZA
FROM ANOTHER STATE,

07:30.721 --> 07:32.782
BUT I CAN'T BUY NEW SNEAKERS.

07:32.783 --> 07:36.125
WELL, IT'S HIS FAVORITE. A
GIFT LIKE THIS CLEARLY SAYS

07:36.126 --> 07:37.927
"I SHOULD HAVE TOLD
YOU ABOUT THE JOB.

07:37.928 --> 07:40.690
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT NOTHING.
AND I'M GLAD YOU GOT HIRED."

07:40.691 --> 07:42.892
THAT'S PUTTING A LOT OF
PRESSURE ON A PIZZA.

07:42.893 --> 07:45.496
YEAH, BUT THIS WAY I DON'T
ACTUALLY HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

07:47.137 --> 07:49.198
HEY, LENNOX. LENNOX?

07:49.199 --> 07:50.570
EVERYTHING OKAY?

07:50.571 --> 07:52.742
NOTHING HAPPENED. IT
WAS JUST A REHEARSAL.

07:52.743 --> 07:55.044
WHO'S TO SAY IT MEANS ANYTHING.
CAN WE JUST DROP IT?!

07:55.045 --> 07:57.507
SORRY TO BADGER YOU LIKE THAT.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.649
SURPRISE.

07:59.650 --> 08:02.552
LOOK WHAT I SO THOUGHTFULLY
GOT FOR YOU... PIZZA.

08:02.553 --> 08:04.754
OH, MIGNONA'S FAMOUS.
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

08:04.755 --> 08:07.017
SHE GOT IT WITH EXTRA
CHEESE AND DOUBLE MEANING.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.660
YEAH, AND GRAND
EXPENSIVE GESTURE

08:10.661 --> 08:13.723
- TO CELEBRATE YOUR FIRST WEEK ON THE JOB.
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

08:13.724 --> 08:16.196
- CAN I TALK TO YOU JUST REAL QUICK IN THE OTHER ROOM?
- MM-HMM.

08:18.098 --> 08:21.030
SO THIS NOTHING
THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

08:21.031 --> 08:22.702
DID IT NOT HAPPEN
WITH ARCHER ADAMS?

08:22.703 --> 08:24.874
OH SHUT UP. YOU'RE
NOT EVEN AT SCHOOL.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.906
YEAH, BUT I READ THE PLAY.
IT'S PRETTY HOT.

08:26.907 --> 08:29.008
YOU KNOW A LOT OF
ROMANCES START ON SET

08:29.009 --> 08:31.782
BECAUSE OF ALL THE...
REHEARSING.

08:32.883 --> 08:34.584
JUST LOOK AT BRAD AND ANGELINA.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.586
- YOU KNOW NOTHING.
- I KNOW THAT ZANDER'S

08:36.587 --> 08:38.719
ABOUT TO FIND OUT HE'S
JENNIFER ANISTON.

08:40.290 --> 08:42.251
SO LOOK, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT THIS FIRST.

08:42.252 --> 08:44.293
BUT I WAS GOING OVER THE
BUDGETS FOR THE CITY

08:44.294 --> 08:47.126
AND THE NUMBERS ARE NOT ADDING UP.
THERE'S MONEY MISSING.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.658
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?

08:48.659 --> 08:50.529
( sighs )

08:50.530 --> 08:52.602
OKAY. ABOUT A MONTH
AGO, I USED PETTY CASH

08:52.603 --> 08:55.234
TO BUY TWO DOZEN MINI-BUNDT
CAKES FOR A STAFF MEETING.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.137
NOBODY ATE THEM SO I
BROUGHT THEM HOME.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.610
THE DISCREPANCY IS $1.2 MILLION.

09:00.611 --> 09:02.141
OKAY, THAT'S NOT ME.

09:02.142 --> 09:05.274
DAMN IT. WHY AM I ALWAYS
STANDING FIVE FEET AWAY

09:05.275 --> 09:06.976
WHEN OTHER PEOPLE STEAL MONEY?

09:06.977 --> 09:09.649
IT'S LIKE THESE SCANDALS, THEY
WILL JUST NOT LEAVE ME ALONE.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.621
YOU KNOW, NEITHER
WILL HOT WOMEN,

09:11.622 --> 09:13.723
BUT THAT'S LIKE A WHOLE
'NOTHER 45 MINUTES.

09:13.724 --> 09:16.726
JOE, THIS HAPPENED BEFORE YOU GOT THERE...
THAT MEANS YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB.

09:16.727 --> 09:19.659
YOU WERE HIRED TO FIND INEFFICIENCIES.
YOU FOUND 1.2 MILLION OF THEM.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.731
NO NO, THESE ARE NOT
INEFFICIENCIES, MEL.

09:21.732 --> 09:24.634
THIS IS A BIG PILE OF GOVERNMENT MONEY
THAT GREW LEGS AND WALKED AWAY.

09:24.635 --> 09:28.638
ALTHOUGH FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY IT COULD HAVE
BOUGHT A FERRARI AND DRIVEN ITSELF AWAY.

09:28.639 --> 09:30.339
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
TELL WAGNER TONIGHT.

09:30.340 --> 09:33.142
JOE, NOT EVERY MILLION DOLLARS
THAT'S MISSING IS A SCANDAL.

09:33.143 --> 09:35.705
IT COULD JUST BE SOME GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED GOVERNMENT WASTE.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.107
HAVE FAITH IN THE SYSTEM.

09:40.711 --> 09:44.754
THOSE ARE SOME PRETTY
GREAT-LOOKING ROCKS.

09:44.755 --> 09:47.156
YEAH, I WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE
THE WAY THE WAVES CARVE...

09:47.157 --> 09:49.719
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY. I'VE
BEEN IN MY OWN HEAD LATELY.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.291
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED YOU FIRST THING.
HOW'D YOUR REHEARSAL GO?

09:52.292 --> 09:55.765
OH, YOU KNOW, THE USUAL. NOTHING SPECIAL.
CERTAINLY NOTHING EXCITING.

09:55.766 --> 09:57.767
JUST, YOU KNOW, TALK
TALK KISS KISS.

09:57.768 --> 09:59.669
KISS KISS KISS.

09:59.670 --> 10:02.331
BUT I'D PREFER TO KISS A GUY
I'M ACTUALLY GOING OUT WITH.

10:02.332 --> 10:04.004
WELL, THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.038
DON'T BE AFRAID TO HOLD
IT A LITTLE LONGER.

10:09.039 --> 10:11.011
AND TRY TURNING YOUR HEAD INTO IT.
YOU KNOW?

10:14.945 --> 10:17.717
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WERE LOOKING FOR?

10:17.718 --> 10:20.050
A LITTLE BIT. MAYBE IT'D
BE BETTER IF WE STOOD UP.

10:22.252 --> 10:24.193
NOW TELL ME YOU
MUST HAVE MY LIPS.

10:24.194 --> 10:25.855
WHAT IS THAT? A
LINE FROM THE PLAY?

10:25.856 --> 10:27.997
NO, JUST SAY IT. IT'S FUN.

10:27.998 --> 10:30.329
I THOUGHT THE KISSING
WAS THE FUN PART.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.961
SO WHY DO I HAVE TO SAY THAT?

10:31.962 --> 10:34.363
BECAUSE YOU'RE SWEPT AWAY
WITH YOUR PASSION FOR ME

10:34.364 --> 10:37.236
LIKE EXCITEMENT WHEN WE FIRST MET AND
YOU CAN NO LONGER CONTROL YOUR...

10:37.237 --> 10:39.709
- ( phone vibrates )
- OH, MY PHONE'S BUZZING. OH.

10:39.710 --> 10:41.771
"I MUST HAVE MY PHONE!"

10:41.772 --> 10:43.943
OH, IT'S THE GUY FROM
THE SILK-SCREEN SHOP.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.047
- I'VE REALLY GOT TO TAKE THIS.
- NO HURRY.

10:49.720 --> 10:52.251
I BET YOU DIDN'T KNOW I WAS
OVER HERE THE WHOLE TIME.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.153
YOU WERE LISTENING TO US?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.025
YEAH, AND WATCHING YOU
TRY AND CAST ZANDER

10:56.026 --> 10:58.689
IN THE NEW PLAY OF YOURS
CALLED "KISSING ARCHER ADAMS."

11:00.190 --> 11:03.092
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I'M DOING
WITH ARCHER IS ACTING

11:03.093 --> 11:04.834
THAT LOOKS LIKE KISSING.

11:04.835 --> 11:07.897
BUT WHEN I KISS ZANDER,

11:07.898 --> 11:10.269
THAT MEANS SOMETHING
BECAUSE HE'S THE ONLY BOY

11:10.270 --> 11:11.941
I TRULY CARE ABOUT.

11:11.942 --> 11:14.173
MM-HMM. SO IN THE PLAY,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.946
IS YOUR ACTING GONNA BE MORE
BELIEVABLE THAN IT IS RIGHT NOW?

11:16.947 --> 11:18.378
( sighs )

11:19.710 --> 11:21.210
SEE, EVERY MONTH THE
PARKS DISBURSEMENT

11:21.211 --> 11:22.411
SHOULD BE GETTING THIS $32,000.

11:22.412 --> 11:26.355
AND EVERY MONTH IT
JUST DOESN'T SHOW UP.

11:26.356 --> 11:27.787
YOU KNOW IT'S...

11:27.788 --> 11:29.719
IT'S GONE.

11:29.720 --> 11:31.861
ALL...

11:31.862 --> 11:36.966
ALL $1.2 MILLION WORTH.

11:36.967 --> 11:38.998
JOE, WITH A GOVERNMENT
THE SIZE OF TOLEDO

11:38.999 --> 11:41.170
A LITTLE MONEY GET'S
MISPLACED ONCE IN A WHILE.

11:41.171 --> 11:44.133
IT'S LIKE WHEN CHANGE FALLS
BETWEEN THE CUSHIONS OF A COUCH.

11:44.134 --> 11:45.935
THAT WOULD BE A
PRETTY BIG COUCH.

11:45.936 --> 11:48.177
SO YOU SEE WHY WE HAD
TO MEET TONIGHT.

11:48.178 --> 11:50.139
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.942
OR WE DON'T DO ANYTHING.

11:52.943 --> 11:55.144
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

11:55.145 --> 11:56.415
HERE'S THE THING.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.487
YOU DON'T NEED ANOTHER
SCANDAL IN YOUR LIFE.

11:58.488 --> 12:01.490
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT, THIS... THIS HAPPENED
LONG BEFORE I STARTED WORKING HERE.

12:01.491 --> 12:04.423
WELL, WHO'S TO SAY REALLY?

12:04.424 --> 12:06.495
AND HOW WOULD IT LOOK
FOR YOUR FRIEND?

12:06.496 --> 12:08.397
YOU KNOW, THE COUNCILWOMAN.

12:08.398 --> 12:10.259
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMING OUT,

12:10.260 --> 12:13.033
IT COULD REALLY... IT COULD
REALLY DAMAGE HER FUTURE.

12:14.204 --> 12:16.365
YOU KNOW WHY YOU'RE
HERE, DON'T YOU?

12:16.366 --> 12:19.368
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
I CAN TRUST YOU.

12:19.369 --> 12:21.740
YEAH, YOU CAN TRUST ME
NOT TO BLOW THE WHISTLE

12:21.741 --> 12:25.744
ON YOUR MONEY-SUCKING COUCH.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.317
AH, IT'S VERY COMPLICATED, MAN.

12:28.318 --> 12:31.151
BUT HASN'T YOUR REPUTATION
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH?

12:33.023 --> 12:35.184
LET ME TAKE YOU OUT
TO DINNER SOMETIME.

12:35.185 --> 12:37.526
YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING STEAK.

12:37.527 --> 12:39.488
OH YEAH.

12:39.489 --> 12:42.391
I BET YOU ARE.

12:42.392 --> 12:46.766
BIG, GREASY, SLIMY
PIECE OF STEAK.

12:52.142 --> 12:54.143
IT'S HIM, BURKE.

12:54.144 --> 12:56.105
WAGNER'S THE ONE WHO'S
BEEN TAKING ALL THE MONEY

12:56.106 --> 12:58.047
- OUT OF THE BUDGETS FOR THE PARKS.
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

12:58.048 --> 12:59.949
YES, I'M POSITIVE.
THAT'S WHY HE HIRED ME.

12:59.950 --> 13:02.481
SEE, HE KNEW IF I SAID ANYTHING, IT
WAS GONNA BLOW UP ON ME AND YOU.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.313
CRAP, IT'S GONNA LOOK
LIKE I'M INVOLVED.

13:04.314 --> 13:06.385
LIKE I BROUGHT YOU IN
TO COVER MY TRACKS.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.918
OH, THERE GOES MY
POLITICAL FUTURE.

13:08.919 --> 13:11.460
OOH, I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
RECOMMENDED YOU FOR THIS JOB!

13:11.461 --> 13:13.863
YOU DIDN'T. YOU HID IT FROM ME.

13:13.864 --> 13:15.895
NOT WELL ENOUGH.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.126
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT, LOOK...

13:17.127 --> 13:19.328
THERE IS ONE THING THAT WE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO TRY, OKAY?

13:19.329 --> 13:21.330
WHEN THINGS STARTED TO
GO SOUTH AT SCANLON,

13:21.331 --> 13:25.274
THE FBI CAME TO ME AND THEY ASKED ME IF
I WOULD HELP SET UP A STING ON LEWIS.

13:25.275 --> 13:29.008
SO YOU WANT TO RUN A SECRET
SPY OPERATION ON WAGNER?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.210
MAYBE WE COULD CRAWL
THROUGH AIR DUCTS

13:31.211 --> 13:33.512
AND LOWER OURSELVES THROUGH
ROTATING FAN BLADES.

13:33.513 --> 13:37.217
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, YOU'RE BRUCE WILLIS?
- I COULD DO WHAT HE DOES.

13:38.488 --> 13:40.219
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE.
LOOK LOOK.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.451
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET
WAGNER TO SAY THAT HE DID IT

13:42.452 --> 13:45.054
- WHILE WE RECORD HIM.
- SO YOU'RE GONNA WEAR A WIRE?

13:45.055 --> 13:46.455
WELL, NO NO NO. NOT ME.

13:46.456 --> 13:49.929
MY CLOTHES ARE WAY TOO FORM-FITTING.
THERE'D BE NOWHERE TO PUT IT.

13:49.930 --> 13:52.561
I KNOW WHERE I'D PUT IT.

13:52.562 --> 13:55.104
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA BE THE ONE WEARING THE WIRE.
- WHAT? NO.

13:55.105 --> 13:59.208
I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC LOOK WITH
CLEAN LINES AND CLASSIC CURVES.

13:59.209 --> 14:02.341
BURKE, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A
REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK, RIGHT?

14:02.342 --> 14:05.374
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GET A LOOSER
SPORT JACKET AND HIDE IT IN THERE?

14:05.375 --> 14:08.147
WHAT? ME IN BAGGY CLOTHES?! NO, THAT
WOULD PUT UP SO MANY RED FLAGS.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.119
OKAY, THIS IS NOT
THAT DIFFICULT.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.251
LOOK, SAY THIS IS OUR
SECRET RECORDING DEVICE.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.924
WHAT ARE YOU... WHAT ARE YOU...

14:15.225 --> 14:16.625
IT'S GONNA DO THAT EVERY TIME.

14:16.626 --> 14:19.288
JUST LIKE GRIP IT WITH
YOUR PECS OR SOMETHING.

14:19.289 --> 14:21.060
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
GRIP IT WITH MY...

14:21.061 --> 14:22.992
LIKE THAT.

14:22.993 --> 14:24.964
YEAH, I THINK WAGNER'S
GONNA REALIZE

14:24.965 --> 14:27.167
THAT I DON'T HAVE A
THIRD RECTANGULAR BOOB.

14:30.540 --> 14:33.272
AUNT MEL, CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING WOMAN TO WOMAN?

14:33.273 --> 14:36.305
CHICA A' CHICA? LAY IT ON ME.

14:36.306 --> 14:39.208
HAVE YOU EVER GOTTEN
AN AMAZINGLY HOT KISS

14:39.209 --> 14:40.379
FROM THE TOTALLY WRONG GUY?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.551
YES. ONCE.

14:42.552 --> 14:44.554
FROM 2001 TO 2005.

14:47.087 --> 14:49.218
YOU KNOW THE PLAY THAT I'M IN?

14:49.219 --> 14:52.261
I'M KISSING THIS GUY ARCHER
AND HE'S KISSING ME BACK

14:52.262 --> 14:54.323
AND IT'S DIFFERENT FROM
WHEN I KISS ZANDER.

14:54.324 --> 14:56.095
- IT'S...
- MORE EXCITING?

14:56.096 --> 14:57.896
MUCH MORE.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.369
I'M THINKING THERE MIGHT BE A
STRONG CONNECTION WITH ARCHER.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.531
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT ZANDER?
- I DON'T KNOW.

15:02.532 --> 15:04.503
THINGS HAVE KIND OF
LOST THEIR SIZZLE.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.675
HE SPENDS ALL OF HIS
TIME DRAWING ROCKS.

15:06.676 --> 15:09.538
HONEY, SERIOUS RELATIONSHIPS
CAN'T ALWAYS BE THRILLING.

15:09.539 --> 15:12.211
YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY
ALL GUYS DRAW ROCKS.

15:12.212 --> 15:15.184
SO IT STARTS OFF EXCITING
AND THEN DROPS OFF TO BLEH?

15:15.185 --> 15:17.146
NOTHING WRONG WITH BLEH.

15:17.147 --> 15:19.648
LOOK, THERE'S NO FIREWORKS ON JULY
5th, BUT IT'S STILL NICE AND WARM.

15:19.649 --> 15:21.550
I'M TOO YOUNG TO
SETTLE FOR WARM.

15:21.551 --> 15:24.423
- I NEED HOT.
- SO ARE YOU SAYING YOU'RE READY TO BREAK UP WITH ZANDER?

15:24.424 --> 15:27.156
ABSOLUTELY NOT, BUT DON'T YOU
THINK I OWE IT TO MYSELF

15:27.157 --> 15:29.598
TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S
SOMETHING THERE WITH ARCHER?

15:29.599 --> 15:32.061
I MEAN THAT KISS.

15:32.062 --> 15:33.932
OKAY, COME BACK FROM THE KISS.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.564
THE KISS IS MESSING
WITH YOUR HEAD.

15:35.565 --> 15:38.107
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WITH
A LITTLE MORE EXPERIENCE.

15:38.108 --> 15:39.368
OKAY, A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE.

15:39.369 --> 15:41.640
YOU DON'T WANT TO RISK
WHAT YOU HAVE WITH ZANDER.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.712
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:43.713 --> 15:45.175
I'M GONNA CALL ARCHER.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.149
HONEY, YOU'RE PLAYING WITH FIRE.
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

15:51.181 --> 15:53.223
OH, WHO AM I KIDDING? I'D
DO THE EXACT SAME THING.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.086
I THINK THIS EXTRA
REHEARSAL TIME

15:57.087 --> 15:58.988
COULD REALLY HELP US.
GOOD IDEA, LENNOX.

15:58.989 --> 16:02.191
WELL, YOU LEARN SO MUCH IN THIS PROCESS.
I'M REALLY ENJOYING IT.

16:02.192 --> 16:04.033
I MEAN THE ACTING.

16:04.034 --> 16:07.496
YOU KNOW, DISCOVERING THE
TRUTH IN EVERY MOMENT.

16:07.497 --> 16:10.399
I STILL FEEL LIKE THE
KISS COULD USE MORE...

16:10.400 --> 16:13.742
- DEFINITION.
- OH, I TOTALLY AGREE.

16:13.743 --> 16:15.704
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:15.705 --> 16:18.407
LET'S JUST LET THE
CHARACTERS GUIDE US.

16:18.408 --> 16:21.510
WHEN ALEJANDRO LEANS INTO CLARA,

16:21.511 --> 16:23.983
HE'S REALLY HOPING THAT...

16:26.056 --> 16:27.057
STOP!

16:28.188 --> 16:29.588
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU DO IT.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.560
WHEN YOU KISS A GIRL,
YOU'VE GOT TO MEAN IT.

16:31.561 --> 16:33.263
LET ME SHOW YOU HOW IT'S DONE.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.230
- HOW WAS THAT?
- PRETTY MUCH PERFECT.

16:41.231 --> 16:44.103
I'M TAKING YOU TO
TOLEDO BEACH RIGHT NOW.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.576
JUST THE TWO OF US. WE'LL WATCH THE SUNSET.
GO GET YOUR BOOKS.

16:47.577 --> 16:49.578
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK
ON YOUR PORTFOLIO?

16:49.579 --> 16:52.212
SCREW THAT. BESIDES I
ALREADY TURNED IT IN.

16:55.645 --> 16:57.586
HEY, MAN.

16:57.587 --> 16:59.288
THANKS FOR THE HEADS UP.

16:59.289 --> 17:01.220
SHE REALLY WAS FEELING
UNAPPRECIATED.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.592
I'M TELLING YOU, A LITTLE
PASSION GOES A LONG WAY.

17:03.593 --> 17:06.195
AND ANYWAY I DID IT AS MUCH
FOR ME AS FOR YOU GUYS.

17:06.196 --> 17:08.327
KEVIN WAS REALLY UPSET
ABOUT ALL THIS KISSING.

17:08.328 --> 17:11.100
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND.

17:11.101 --> 17:12.801
YOU'RE A TALENTED ACTOR.

17:12.802 --> 17:14.364
OH, NO DOUBT I AM FABULOUS.

17:16.166 --> 17:19.208
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, BABE. I'M
SORRY TO SKIP OUT ON REHEARSALS,

17:19.209 --> 17:21.310
BUT WHEN YOUR MAN
KISSES YOU LIKE THAT...

17:21.311 --> 17:22.571
I GET IT...

17:22.572 --> 17:24.174
TRUST ME.

17:26.816 --> 17:29.518
YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THE RIB EYE HERE.
IT'S NOT CHEAP, BUT...

17:29.519 --> 17:31.721
- WE CAN AFFORD IT, RIGHT?
- YES, WE CAN.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.124
ARE YOU TWO GONNA TELL
ME WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

17:35.125 --> 17:36.385
OR ARE YOU GONNA KEEP
SHOOTING EACH OTHER LOOKS

17:36.386 --> 17:38.287
LIKE A COUPLE OF
BAD POKER PLAYERS?

17:38.288 --> 17:39.658
HERE'S THE DEAL.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.360
WE BOTH KNOW THE
MONEY IS MISSING.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.832
"MISSING."

17:43.833 --> 17:45.694
WE PROMISE NOT TO SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT THE MONEY

17:45.695 --> 17:48.167
AS LONG AS WE GET A
PIECE OF THE PIE.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.598
YEAH, AND A NICE PIECE TOO,

17:49.599 --> 17:53.372
YOU KNOW, WITH FRUIT IN IT.
MADE WITH LOTS OF "DOUGH."

17:53.373 --> 17:55.204
I'M SURE WE CAN SPEAK CANDIDLY

17:55.205 --> 17:57.846
BECAUSE NO ONE HERE IS
WEARING A WIRE. RIGHT?

17:57.847 --> 18:00.849
CLEARLY, LONGO, WITH THE WAY YOU DRESS,
THERE'S NOWHERE TO PUT ONE ON YOU.

18:00.850 --> 18:04.213
SO I'M GUESSING IT'S THE
ESTEEMED COUNCILWOMAN.

18:04.214 --> 18:06.685
NOW IS THAT A RECORDING DEVICE
TUCKED UNDERNEATH THERE

18:06.686 --> 18:08.157
OR ARE YOU JUST HAPPY TO SEE ME?

18:08.158 --> 18:10.689
OH!

18:10.690 --> 18:12.261
TOTAL AMATEURS.

18:12.262 --> 18:14.293
I EXPECTED A LITTLE
MORE INGENUITY.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.094
DID YOU GET THE
EXTENDED WARRANTY?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.727
- NO, I JUST...
- OH, TOO BAD.

18:18.728 --> 18:21.270
YOU TOLD ME YOU COULDN'T SEE IT.

18:21.271 --> 18:23.202
WELL, I'M SORRY FOR NOT STARING
DOWN YOUR SHIRT ALL NIGHT.

18:23.203 --> 18:26.235
LOVELY, ANTHONY, AS ALWAYS.

18:26.236 --> 18:27.736
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
DROP THE WHOLE MATTER

18:27.737 --> 18:29.238
AND ENJOY OURSELVES.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.310
LET'S JUST RELAX.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.412
SAVOR THE GOOD LIFE.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.214
WHILE THE CITY OF
TOLEDO FOOTS THE BILL?

18:35.215 --> 18:36.285
I'M-A LICK IT.

18:36.286 --> 18:38.487
WHAT ARE YOU...

18:38.488 --> 18:40.489
YOU'RE ACTUALLY GONNA EAT?

18:40.490 --> 18:42.151
WHAT?

18:42.152 --> 18:45.254
WASTING A PERFECTLY GOOD RIB
EYE WON'T PROVE ANYTHING.

18:45.255 --> 18:48.357
- ( coughs )
- OH MY GOD, LET ME JUST...

18:48.358 --> 18:50.128
NO NO NO. WAIT WAIT WAIT.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.301
HOLD... HOLD... JUST
HOLD ON A SECOND, MEL.

18:52.302 --> 18:54.333
- HE'S FINE.
- ( bangs table )

18:54.334 --> 18:57.307
DON'T WORRY. I GOT IT, REALLY.
EAT, ENJOY IT, OKAY.

18:58.608 --> 19:00.410
THAT WAS A PRETTY BIG
BITE THERE, PAUL.

19:02.212 --> 19:04.243
SO LOOK, HERE'S MY
PROPOSAL, ALL RIGHT?

19:04.244 --> 19:06.715
I'M GONNA COME OVER THERE
AND SAVE YOUR LIFE

19:06.716 --> 19:09.147
AS LONG AS YOU ADMIT THAT
YOU STOLE THE MONEY.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.749
WOULD YOU DO THAT LITTLE
THING FOR ME? YEAH?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.281
YOU WILL? OKAY.

19:12.282 --> 19:14.283
SO YOU DID IN FACT
STEAL THE MONEY?

19:14.284 --> 19:16.225
- ( mutters )
- YOU DID? OKAY. ALL RIGHT, GREAT.

19:16.226 --> 19:17.756
READY? HERE WE GO.

19:17.757 --> 19:18.927
ONE. TWO.

19:18.928 --> 19:21.159
THREE. THAR SHE BLOWS.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.232
- OKAY.
- ( gasps )

19:23.233 --> 19:25.764
YOU KNOW, I MADE HIM LEARN HOW TO
DO THAT WHEN HE TOOK THE NANNY JOB.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.437
- SO I JUST TECHNICALLY SAVED YOUR LIFE TOO.
- UH-HUH.

19:28.438 --> 19:31.670
THAT'S VERY CUTE, LONGO. BUT YOUR
PROOF IS IN A GLASS OF WATER.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.203
- SO YOU GOT NOTHING.
- BUT YOU DID TAKE THE MONEY?

19:34.204 --> 19:36.745
YEAH, I TOOK THE MONEY. BUT NO ONE'S
GONNA BELIEVE THE TWO OF YOU...

19:36.746 --> 19:39.648
A WALL-STREET CON MAN AND
HIS NAIVE CO-CONSPIRATOR.

19:39.649 --> 19:42.781
YOU GUYS SAY ANYTHING
AND YOU BOTH GO DOWN.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.182
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GREAT, PAUL?

19:44.183 --> 19:47.656
AT THAT LITTLE STORE WHERE THEY
SELL YOU RECORDING DEVICES,

19:47.657 --> 19:50.420
THEY ALSO SELL ONES THAT...

19:52.522 --> 19:53.963
LOOK JUST LIKE SALT SHAKERS.

19:55.525 --> 19:57.926
THAT WAY AMATEURS LIKE US CAN
LULL PROFESSIONALS LIKE YOU

19:57.927 --> 20:00.600
INTO A FALSE SENSE OF
SECURITY WITH A DECOY.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.603
YOU DOUBLE-CROSSING SNAKE!

20:04.604 --> 20:07.205
OH, LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT THE
COUNCILMAN WAS LOOKING AT ME

20:07.206 --> 20:08.677
WHEN HE MADE THAT UNKIND REMARK.

20:08.678 --> 20:10.980
LET THE RECORD ALSO SHOW THE
COUNCILMAN IS A DOUCHEBAG.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.982
YOU WANNA GET THAT FOOD TO GO?
'CAUSE WE SHOULD PROBABLY

20:13.983 --> 20:15.814
JUST HEAD DOWN TO THE POLICE
STATION LIKE RIGHT NOW.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.986
OH YEAH, LET'S STOP OFF AT
CHANNEL SIX ON THE WAY.

20:17.987 --> 20:19.988
- YOU KNOW, THEY'LL EAT THIS UP.
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:19.989 --> 20:23.322
- I BET THEY WON'T CHOKE ON IT.
- YEAH, IT'LL PROBABLY GO DOWN SMOOTH AND EASY.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.993
YOU GUYS THINK YOU'RE
CUTE, DON'T YOU?

20:24.994 --> 20:25.994
- YEAH, WE DO.
- WE DO.

20:25.995 --> 20:28.227
WE GOT A THING. WE JUST KINDA...
( laughs )

20:30.800 --> 20:32.000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:32.001 --> 20:32.962
- IT'S A $60 STEAK!
- LET'S GO!

20:39.469 --> 20:40.669
( music from television )

20:40.670 --> 20:41.770
HURRY IT'S ON. IT'S ON.

20:41.771 --> 20:43.672
Two-term councilman Paul Wagner

20:43.673 --> 20:45.474
was arrested tonight

20:45.475 --> 20:48.477
for embezzlement of city funds.

20:48.478 --> 20:51.750
And who set up the sting that
exposed the massive theft?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.622
- None other than...
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:53.623 --> 20:55.584
Councilwoman Mel Burke.

20:55.585 --> 20:56.985
NO MENTION OF ME?

20:56.986 --> 20:59.458
I THINK I SAID YOUR NAME.
I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.

20:59.459 --> 21:00.759
And who was on

21:00.760 --> 21:03.462
Paul Wagner's staff
when the news broke?

21:03.463 --> 21:07.596
Disgraced financial
wizard Joseph Longo.

21:07.597 --> 21:10.440
- OH, THERE YOU GO, JOE.
- AND THEY CALLED YOU A WIZARD.

21:11.701 --> 21:13.702
And being wrapped up
in this new scandal

21:13.703 --> 21:15.674
is probably gonna
cost Longo his job.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.377
- WHAT?!
- OH, COME ON. LIKE YOU DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING?

21:18.378 --> 21:20.449
HEY, I DID MY JOB! ALL RIGHT?

21:20.450 --> 21:22.681
I FOUND WASTE! I
FOUND CORRUPTION!

21:22.682 --> 21:24.012
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

21:24.013 --> 21:25.955
WOULD YOU KNOCK THAT OFF?
