00:06.167 --> 00:08.167
Previously on ER:

00:08.200 --> 00:10.267
Got a medical transport
plane in Kinshasa

00:10.300 --> 00:11.533
waiting to take
you back.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.233

00:26.400 --> 00:27.800
( groaning )

00:33.867 --> 00:35.133
( shouting )

00:35.167 --> 00:37.300
Shoot!

00:48.900 --> 00:50.233
( sighs )

00:50.267 --> 00:52.833
( vomiting )

00:52.867 --> 00:55.267
( groaning )

01:04.599 --> 01:05.767
Getting bad out there?

01:05.800 --> 01:06.567
Yes.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.033
Merry Christmas Eve, huh?

01:08.067 --> 01:09.167
If you say so.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.600
WEAVER:
You're late.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.400
Yeah, I had to walk
from LaSalle.

01:12.433 --> 01:14.200
My bus crashed
into a UPS truck.

01:14.233 --> 01:15.533
Whoa.

01:15.567 --> 01:17.067
Weak and dizzy
in Six,

01:17.100 --> 01:19.300
LOL with bloody
stool in Two

01:19.333 --> 01:20.733
and there's a kid
who swallowed

01:20.767 --> 01:22.367
a Christmas tree
ornament in Five.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.200
Work them up and send
them to Dr. Kovac.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.300
My shoes are soaking wet.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.867
Happy holidays,
everybody.

01:26.900 --> 01:27.667
Where's she going?

01:27.700 --> 01:29.067
Home to wait for
the Ghost

01:29.100 --> 01:30.500
of Christmas Past to show up.

01:30.533 --> 01:31.833
NEELA:
Thanks, Michael.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.700
I was afraid you'd
already have it.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.300
No, it's great.

01:35.333 --> 01:36.800
A kid swallowed
an ornament?

01:36.833 --> 01:39.700
Yeah, Mom's worried about
the wire hanging hook thing.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.167
Take a couple
of minutes.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.967
The old lady with
the bloody stool

01:43.000 --> 01:44.833
can wait for you
to change your shoes.

01:44.867 --> 01:46.067
Thanks.
Hey, Abby,

01:46.100 --> 01:47.700
did you get your
trinket from Carter?

01:47.733 --> 01:48.567
What?

01:48.600 --> 01:50.000
His Third World care package.

01:50.033 --> 01:51.567
Gone-native junk for everybody.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.067
Look, Kovac's got, eh,
some kind of voodoo mask.

01:55.100 --> 01:56.467
I think
it's Bangala.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.067
Yeah, they use it
to slaughter farm animals

01:59.100 --> 02:01.067
in some kind of satanic ritual.

02:01.100 --> 02:02.300
Oh, here.

02:04.100 --> 02:05.533
Go ahead,
it won't bite.

02:05.567 --> 02:08.167
You ever send that box
of stuff to Africa, Frank?

02:08.199 --> 02:10.032
Toys For Third World Tots?

02:10.067 --> 02:12.167
Went out last week.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.300
What'd you get?

02:16.200 --> 02:17.500
A box.

02:17.533 --> 02:19.467
A tribal shaman's box.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.000
Medicine men use it
to store their potions.

02:25.900 --> 02:27.167
Oh, Lord.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.733
Merry Christmas everybody.

02:28.767 --> 02:30.333
Welcome to Calcutta.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.333
Yeah, come on,
come on, that's it.

02:32.367 --> 02:33.600
Hey, what is that?

02:33.633 --> 02:35.200
It's a little bit
of Sikh rap.

02:35.233 --> 02:36.633
Sikh rap?

02:36.667 --> 02:38.100
Hey, you ready
to go?

02:38.133 --> 02:39.233
No,
keep dancing.

02:39.267 --> 02:41.233
She's good.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.667
Okay, I'll be back for the H&Ps.

03:11.867 --> 03:13.033
This one?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.300
WOMAN:
Yeah.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.100
( rattling )

03:17.133 --> 03:18.267
Don't
you shake it.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.867
( chuckles )

03:25.467 --> 03:27.933
Oh, God, are you
a paper saver?

03:27.967 --> 03:29.233
( chuckles )

03:29.267 --> 03:30.933
No.

03:33.833 --> 03:37.233
Mebendazole,
how romantic.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.633
Open it.

03:47.167 --> 03:48.533
You like it?

03:48.567 --> 03:50.767
That
is beautiful.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.300
Mm...
it was my father's.

03:55.967 --> 03:58.000
I want you to have it.

03:59.867 --> 04:01.833
Go on,
try it on.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.900
Wow.

04:12.933 --> 04:15.367
It suits you.

04:16.867 --> 04:17.899
Thank you.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.367
So, what'd you get me?

04:25.400 --> 04:26.967
It'd better be good.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.433
( chuckling )

04:28.467 --> 04:30.233
I hope you won't
be disappointed.

04:30.267 --> 04:31.600
Come on.

04:37.200 --> 04:41.167
It's, um,
kind of sentimental.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.533
Mm-hmm.

04:44.933 --> 04:46.400
( metallic clinking )

04:53.633 --> 04:55.233
Oh...

04:55.267 --> 04:58.933
They were mine
when I was little.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.833
( kisses )
Thank you.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.267
There's more.

05:12.933 --> 05:15.967
I want you come back
to the States with me.

05:21.533 --> 05:25.467
I want our baby
to be born in America.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.800
Well, back to work.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.567
You really don't like
the Dixie Chicks?

06:38.600 --> 06:40.933
Everybody likes
the Dixie Chicks.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.500
Everybody?

06:43.533 --> 06:45.933
Everybody
with any taste.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.367
( Carter
speaking French )

06:57.400 --> 06:59.467
He's weak on the right.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.433
Toxoplasmosis.

07:01.467 --> 07:02.867
We got a CT?

07:02.900 --> 07:05.367
No, so treat with Sulfadiazine,

07:05.400 --> 07:06.867
Pyrimethamine,
Folonic acid.

07:06.900 --> 07:07.900
Spinal tap?

07:07.933 --> 07:09.467
No, we have to save
the taps

07:09.500 --> 07:11.100
for the patients
who really need them.

07:11.133 --> 07:12.467
And he doesn't?

07:12.500 --> 07:15.067
If he doesn't improve
in a week,

07:15.100 --> 07:18.000
we'll tap him then.

07:18.033 --> 07:19.500
Hi, you looking for me?

07:19.533 --> 07:21.500
How's our Belgian
dermatologist?

07:21.533 --> 07:23.900
Oh, suffering from
first day shock.

07:23.933 --> 07:24.933
He'll be all right.

07:24.967 --> 07:27.067
So, are you
coming tonight?

07:27.100 --> 07:28.367
Yeah.
9:00?

07:28.400 --> 07:30.000
Coming alone?

07:30.033 --> 07:31.433
No.

07:31.467 --> 07:32.567
What?

07:32.600 --> 07:34.033
I think
it's great.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.200
( chuckling ):
It's nothing serious.

07:36.233 --> 07:37.533
9:00 then.

07:38.833 --> 07:43.600
( engine rumbling )

07:43.633 --> 07:48.433
( indistinct chattering )

07:57.467 --> 08:00.467
Bonjour! Ca vas.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.267
( talking at once )

08:03.300 --> 08:05.233
WOMAN:
Oh, come on, it is
not that simple.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.433
Imperialism
is imperialism,

08:06.467 --> 08:08.467
no matter whether
the conqueror claims

08:08.500 --> 08:10.500
that the conquered
will be better off.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.667
Again?
Mm.

08:12.700 --> 08:15.333
The conqueror
brings with him

08:15.367 --> 08:17.100
the seeds of his
own destruction.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.267
Heiner Muller.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.900
Very good.

08:20.933 --> 08:22.067
Muller.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.200
Right.

08:23.233 --> 08:24.000
Americans
are like sheep.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.433
I don't understand

08:25.467 --> 08:27.567
why they aren't
rioting in the streets

08:27.600 --> 08:29.233
of Palm Springs
or Atlana.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.500
CARTER:
Atlanta. Ta.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.433
Two T's.
And Palm Springs?

08:32.467 --> 08:33.600
Nobody riots
in Palm Springs,

08:33.633 --> 08:35.232
they're too busy
playing golf.

08:35.267 --> 08:36.967
You can't argue democracy
hasn't been a positive force

08:37.000 --> 08:38.567
for change throughout
the world in the last...

08:38.600 --> 08:41.933
Hiroshima, Chile,
Vietnam...

08:41.967 --> 08:42.933
Uh...

08:42.967 --> 08:43.500
Hungary,

08:43.533 --> 08:44.600
Poland, Romania...

08:44.633 --> 08:47.400
Coca-Cola, Marlboro,

08:47.433 --> 08:48.567
McDonald's...

08:48.600 --> 08:50.000
Oh, mon dieu, what
I would give

08:50.033 --> 08:51.900
for a Quarter Pounder
avec cheese right now.

08:51.933 --> 08:54.000
That's exactly what
I'm talking about.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.500
American commercialism
is ruining music, film,

08:56.533 --> 08:58.000
indigenous culture
around the world.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.400
CARTER:
Listen, from what
I've heard

08:59.433 --> 09:02.267
of, uh,
French rock and roll,

09:02.300 --> 09:03.833
you were
well on your way

09:03.867 --> 09:05.900
to ruining French music
all on your own.

09:05.933 --> 09:07.267
I thought
this was supposed

09:07.300 --> 09:08.767
to be a celebration?

09:09.500 --> 09:10.700
I don't so much mind

09:10.733 --> 09:12.467
American intervention
in Iraq.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.433
The Baathists were rapists
and mass murderers.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.800
Hear, hear.

09:18.833 --> 09:21.567
But I do mind America
callously dismissing

09:21.600 --> 09:23.800
legitimate international
concerns.

09:23.833 --> 09:27.333
Just trampling 50 years of
carefully crafted diplomacy

09:27.367 --> 09:28.600
in pursuit of
it's own

09:28.633 --> 09:30.500
political and
economic interests.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.300
Makemba Likasu,
Dr. John Carter.

09:33.333 --> 09:35.267
Kem works with
the Ministry of Health.

09:35.300 --> 09:36.333
And her friend, Peter.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.133
I have no idea
what Peter does?

09:38.167 --> 09:39.300
What do you do, Peter?

09:39.333 --> 09:40.833
Ministry of Finance.

09:40.867 --> 09:43.333
Kem's setting up an ARV
demonstration project

09:43.367 --> 09:44.333
for AIDS patients.

09:44.367 --> 09:45.667
Oh, that's great.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.300
Has everybody already
ordered already?

09:47.333 --> 09:48.633
MANY:
Oui.

09:49.867 --> 09:51.633
Oh, wait, I love this song.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.000
Come on, Walter.
Let's dance.

09:54.033 --> 09:55.200
Come on, Walter.

09:55.233 --> 09:58.267
CARTER:
Be very, very,
careful.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.100
( laughing )

10:01.700 --> 10:04.367
So, what project
are you working on?

10:04.400 --> 10:07.600
I'm starting a small
HIV/AIDS program

10:07.633 --> 10:09.267
with money from
the Global Fund.

10:09.300 --> 10:10.533
Antiretroviral
therapy.

10:10.567 --> 10:11.833
Really?

10:11.867 --> 10:12.633
Mm-hmm.

10:12.667 --> 10:13.767
Triple cocktail,
here?

10:13.800 --> 10:15.467
Skepticism
is well-founded.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.167
We have our doubters.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.133
Well, can you afford to treat
millions of patients, right?

10:20.167 --> 10:22.400
I mean, meds cost $15,000
a year per person

10:22.433 --> 10:24.967
and we can't even get
IV antibiotics here.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.067
My point exactly.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.133
We're not using
American drugs.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.433
Another perfect example

10:29.467 --> 10:31.033
of American commercial
self-interest.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.133
I mean, blocking the use

10:32.167 --> 10:33.833
of generics.

10:33.867 --> 10:36.067
After the WTO ruled
that poor countries

10:36.100 --> 10:39.167
could ignore drug patents,
India developed a generic.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.800
It only costs $200
a year per patient.

10:41.833 --> 10:43.600
Money we also don't have.

10:43.633 --> 10:45.633
What is your
alternative, Peter?

10:45.667 --> 10:47.800
Just to watch
30 million Africans die

10:47.833 --> 10:49.233
in the next
ten years?

10:49.267 --> 10:50.167
If we can
demonstrate

10:50.200 --> 10:51.667
that these programs work,

10:51.700 --> 10:54.367
then we can appeal to the UN,
to rich countries,

10:54.400 --> 10:55.800
to our own
governments.

10:55.833 --> 10:58.300
I think I just heard
someone playing our song.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.800
Imperialist Yankee dollars ride
to the rescue again.

11:00.833 --> 11:02.400
It's nice to know
we're still needed

11:02.433 --> 11:04.000
for something
around here, isn't it?

11:04.033 --> 11:05.700
( chuckling )

11:05.733 --> 11:07.967
Oh, Peter,
stop pouting.

11:09.400 --> 11:10.767
Let's dance.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.467
It's Bastille Day, you know?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.933
Vive la revolution!

11:34.967 --> 11:37.067
I won't be forced
to say nice things

11:37.100 --> 11:39.267
about the French all day now,
will I?

11:39.300 --> 11:41.567
He's not improving.

11:41.600 --> 11:44.200
When did we start him
on sulfadiazine?

11:44.233 --> 11:45.300
Ten days ago.

11:45.333 --> 11:48.400
Now do we do
a spinal tap?

11:48.433 --> 11:50.267
Yeah.

11:50.300 --> 11:51.967
Is this his wife?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.267
Yes.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.600
Tell her that
we need to do

11:54.633 --> 11:55.567
some additional tests.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.567
( speaking French )

11:56.600 --> 11:58.133
I speak English.

12:00.200 --> 12:01.767
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.933
Your husband is not getting
any better on the medicine,

12:03.967 --> 12:05.633
so we need to do some
additional tests.

12:05.667 --> 12:08.833
He's very sick?

12:08.867 --> 12:10.100
Yes.

12:10.133 --> 12:12.600
He will die soon?

12:12.633 --> 12:15.033
Not immediately.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.867
But yes.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.333
How pregnant are you?

12:21.367 --> 12:23.000
Six months.

12:23.033 --> 12:26.167
Do you know why
your husband is dying?

12:27.433 --> 12:29.100
AIDS.

12:29.133 --> 12:32.333
And have you been tested?

12:32.367 --> 12:34.867
No.

12:35.933 --> 12:37.300
Your children?

12:37.333 --> 12:39.200
Hmm-mm.

12:39.233 --> 12:41.200
It only takes a few minutes.

12:41.233 --> 12:42.267
Why?

12:42.300 --> 12:43.567
Is there anything
you can do

12:43.600 --> 12:45.000
to help us
if we are sick?

12:45.033 --> 12:47.833
If you are HIV positive,
we can give you medicine

12:47.867 --> 12:49.200
to try and keep you
from passing it

12:49.233 --> 12:52.800
along to your baby when
the baby is born.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.200
Yes?

12:54.233 --> 12:56.700
Yes.

12:58.733 --> 13:00.133
Dad's dying. End stage.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.700
He's probably
got a couple of weeks.

13:01.733 --> 13:03.100
Mom's pregnant,
she's got two kids.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.933
One's 18 months,
the other's five.

13:04.967 --> 13:06.333
All the tests
came back positive.

13:06.367 --> 13:08.433
You got a CD4 count?

13:08.467 --> 13:10.533
She's stage three.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.200
They've been living
in the refugee camp.

13:13.233 --> 13:14.600
She had to flee
the fighting

13:14.633 --> 13:15.900
in Bukavu last March.

13:15.933 --> 13:18.333
Has she been to a VCT center?

13:18.367 --> 13:20.333
VCT?

13:20.367 --> 13:22.633
Counseling. Community support.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.633
She doesn't
need counseling,

13:24.667 --> 13:26.967
she needs antiretroviral drugs.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.033
You want to get her
into my pilot program?

13:31.067 --> 13:32.733
She's a teacher,

13:32.767 --> 13:35.333
when her husband dies, she'll be
the sole support for her family.

13:35.367 --> 13:36.667
I would think that
would make her

13:36.700 --> 13:38.000
the perfect candidate.

13:38.033 --> 13:40.033
I can only enroll
ten patients a month.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.733
We're only funded
for 200 participants.

13:42.767 --> 13:43.833
Total?

13:43.867 --> 13:44.967
Uh-huh.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
How long
is your waiting list?

13:47.033 --> 13:49.700
The selection committee
is very particular

13:49.733 --> 13:51.033
about who gets in.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.167
How long?

13:52.200 --> 13:54.800
We can only take patients
with TLCs under 1200.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.133
They have to live
close to the clinic,

13:56.167 --> 13:57.367
they have to agree
to participate

13:57.400 --> 13:58.367
for a minimum
of five years

13:58.400 --> 13:59.667
and shown consistency

13:59.700 --> 14:01.667
in taking previous drug
regimens.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.133
If they fulfill
all these criteria,

14:03.167 --> 14:05.067
they're included
in the list of candidates

14:05.100 --> 14:06.967
that I present
to the committee monthly.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.900
They then select ten
to get the ARV drugs.

14:10.933 --> 14:14.300
We have six fully
occupied AIDS wards

14:14.333 --> 14:16.167
in this hospital,
Dr. Carter.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.767
Every patient in every ward
wants to be in my program.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.833
Who would you
like me to exclude

14:21.867 --> 14:24.333
so I can take your
mother from Bukavu?

14:24.367 --> 14:26.900
( coughing )

14:32.500 --> 14:34.067
Your AIDS drug
finally came.

14:34.100 --> 14:36.167
Pharmacy needs
you to sign your
credit card slip.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.067
Great, thanks.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.567
1,200 bucks.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.533
Yep, Carter's
paying me back.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.267
Carter needs
antiretrovirals?

14:43.300 --> 14:44.900
What, did he get
a stick or something?

14:44.933 --> 14:46.333
No. Patient.

14:46.367 --> 14:47.800
Well, say hello to him
for me, will you?

14:47.833 --> 14:49.333
Why don't you
write a note?

14:49.367 --> 14:51.133
I'll stick it in.

14:53.667 --> 14:55.800
Leave a little
for somebody else?

14:58.033 --> 15:00.667
You're Kovac right?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.467
Med student
needs you down the hall.

15:06.433 --> 15:09.567
Call a pick-up for me,
will you, Frank?

15:09.600 --> 15:11.400
You get used to the heat.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.067
It's the food--
that's another matter.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.867
Mm. Can't be any hotter

15:14.900 --> 15:16.567
than it was last year
in the Sudan.

15:16.600 --> 15:20.200
Thank you, Charles.

15:20.233 --> 15:22.700
So, you've, uh, you've
volunteered before?

15:22.733 --> 15:24.567
Yeah, every year
for the last eight.

15:24.600 --> 15:25.767
What is that?

15:25.800 --> 15:26.733
Lasagna.

15:26.767 --> 15:28.533
Made with potatoes?

15:30.167 --> 15:31.233
( chuckles )

15:31.267 --> 15:32.400
Excellent.

15:32.433 --> 15:33.700
Halloween candy?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.767
Ooh, anything
chocolate?

15:35.800 --> 15:37.533
Hmm.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.333
Who's Elizabeth?

15:41.367 --> 15:44.667
She is a friend from work.

15:45.567 --> 15:47.500
Friend?

15:47.533 --> 15:49.167
She blonde?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.767
She's a redhead,
actually.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.067
So, are you in private practice
back in the States?

15:53.100 --> 15:54.433
Yeah, I spent

15:54.467 --> 15:56.433
15 years at Women
and Children's, O.B. ward.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.300
Oh, yeah?
Uh-huh.

15:58.333 --> 16:01.200
I have a patient eight months
pregnant, HIV-positive.

16:01.233 --> 16:04.033
Husband's end stage.
She's got a couple of kids
who are HIV-positive, too.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.567
I'd love it if
you'd take a look.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.467
Sure, anytime.
How 'bout now?

16:11.267 --> 16:13.033
GINNY:
How's her CD4 count?

16:13.067 --> 16:16.400
CARTER:
175, but that should
come up with the ARVs.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.700
Ah, good heartbeat,
Mommy. Strong.

16:19.733 --> 16:21.700
And the ARVs cut
the transmission rate

16:21.733 --> 16:23.233
down to three
or four percent,

16:23.267 --> 16:24.867
so, if she uses formula,

16:24.900 --> 16:27.700
that cuts it down
to one percent.

16:27.733 --> 16:30.367
Uh-huh. Are you living
in the refugee camp?

16:30.400 --> 16:32.167
Yes.
And are you
still breastfeeding?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.467
Yes.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.767
Celine, you can't
breastfeed the new baby.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.700
Uh, you could pass
the virus along
in your milk,

16:39.733 --> 16:42.100
so we'll get you formula,
which is great stuff,

16:42.133 --> 16:44.500
and that will help
keep your baby strong.

16:44.533 --> 16:46.067
My milk can make my baby sick?

16:46.100 --> 16:47.367
Absolutely.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.433
Uh, Doctor, can I speak
with you a moment?

16:49.467 --> 16:51.500
You're doing great, Mommy.

16:51.533 --> 16:54.467
Listen, she's going
to have to breast feed.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.967
No, we get the, uh, formula
in the UNICEF packs.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.667
No, it's powdered.
You have to mix
it with water.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.633
Mm-hmm.
She's living
in a camp.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.200
She's going to have
to get that water from
a lake or a river,

17:03.233 --> 17:05.467
and there's a 50% chance
that her baby's going to die

17:05.500 --> 17:07.032
from dysentery or cholera.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.032
The three percent chance
of contracting HIV

17:09.067 --> 17:11.032
from breast milk--
it's a bargain.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.032
CARTER:
I'll get her
bottled water.

17:13.067 --> 17:17.233
Eight times a day
for six months, a
year, two years?

17:17.267 --> 17:18.532
It's possible.

17:18.567 --> 17:20.532
Maybe, but it's
not practical.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.200
What do you expect?

17:22.233 --> 17:24.733
Of course they're going
to start blowing things up.

17:24.767 --> 17:27.032
MICHELLE:
Nationalism, tribalism...

17:27.067 --> 17:29.000
You didn't figure
it out with Vietnam?

17:29.033 --> 17:30.567
CARTER:
No, we're slow learners.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.667
DAVID:
Now you come

17:31.700 --> 17:32.900
begging Europe
for help...

17:32.933 --> 17:35.333
Soldiers, money,
but not as partners.

17:35.367 --> 17:39.667
No, you just want us to
legitimize your misadventures.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.567
What can I say?

17:41.600 --> 17:42.667
I voted for the other guy.

17:42.700 --> 17:44.467
Is it always like this?

17:44.500 --> 17:47.467
The conversation is
turning into something
of a perennial.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.867
If America is going
to insist on bombing

17:48.900 --> 17:50.533
half of the world
into some...
David, enough.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.533
Really, if they're
going to keep...
Forget it!

17:53.600 --> 17:54.767
We all get it.

17:57.367 --> 17:58.367
Come on,

17:58.400 --> 18:00.767
let's dance.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.733
Come on.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.700
Dance.
Sure.

18:14.267 --> 18:16.033
Okay.

18:29.467 --> 18:31.567
Where's your friend?

18:32.600 --> 18:34.533
From the Red Cross?

18:34.567 --> 18:38.700
ICRC food convoy to Goma.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.967
And yours?

18:43.000 --> 18:45.233
Peter?

18:45.267 --> 18:47.467
He's at conference in Nairobi.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.467
Something
about currency fluctuations

18:50.500 --> 18:52.667
in the capital market.

19:01.267 --> 19:03.400
How's your AIDS study coming?

19:03.433 --> 19:05.567
Fully enrolled.
All 200.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.867
Really, great.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.400
What about
your adherence rate?

19:10.433 --> 19:11.800
100 percent.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.533
Wow.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.000
We have this
combination pill,

19:16.033 --> 19:18.800
so patients only have to take
two a day.

19:18.833 --> 19:20.700
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:20.733 --> 19:23.033
In America, the patients
have to take seven.

19:26.567 --> 19:28.033
Where are you from?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.800
I've been trying to place
your accent.

19:29.833 --> 19:32.400
My father was Congolese.

19:32.433 --> 19:34.567
My mother's French.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.000
They met when he was
in school in Paris.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.500
Where were you raised?

19:38.533 --> 19:39.800
London mostly,

19:39.833 --> 19:41.833
but my mother remarried.

19:41.867 --> 19:45.233
Moba in the summers
with my dad.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.733
What about you?

19:46.767 --> 19:50.233
I was born and raised
in Chicago, Illinois,

19:50.267 --> 19:51.933
the Windy City.

19:53.467 --> 19:55.633
Have you ever been
to America?

19:55.667 --> 19:59.967
No... but I've seen
it in the movies.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.600
You want to dance?

20:08.100 --> 20:09.933
I am terrible.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.467
Good.

20:12.367 --> 20:14.733
So am I.

20:22.733 --> 20:25.400
All right, what's your...

20:25.433 --> 20:26.567
No, no,
...most embarrassing...

20:26.600 --> 20:27.867
oh, no, no, no,
not a chance.

20:27.900 --> 20:29.700
Come on, I just
told you mine.

20:29.733 --> 20:32.067
That wasn't embarrassing
so much as stupid.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.700
Come on, give it up.

20:33.733 --> 20:38.400
Uh... it involved
a lack of clothing.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.333
Oh, thank God.

20:40.367 --> 20:43.067
Merci infiniment.
Looks like we closed
the place.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.467
Bonsoir.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.200
Bonsoir? When are you
going to tell me

20:46.233 --> 20:48.000
how you got naked?

20:48.033 --> 20:50.300
( laughs )

20:50.333 --> 20:53.433
What happened, uh...
what happened to
your patient:

20:53.467 --> 20:56.333
the mother, HIV,
and the kids?

20:56.367 --> 20:58.800
Celine? Oh, she's doing great.

20:58.833 --> 21:01.100
You got her to
a VCT center?

21:01.133 --> 21:04.700
No, I got her on ARVs.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.233
Antiretroviral drugs?

21:07.267 --> 21:09.867
Yeah. CD4's over 400.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.867
Where'd you
get the drugs?

21:11.900 --> 21:14.700
I had a, uh,
friend of mine

21:14.733 --> 21:19.567
write a prescription back home
and ship 'em over.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.533
You smuggled them in?

21:21.567 --> 21:24.700
No, no, I used FedEx.

21:25.767 --> 21:28.067
What?

21:28.100 --> 21:29.400
What, she's doing great.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.900
Drugs entering
the country

21:30.933 --> 21:32.533
have to be registered
and approved

21:32.567 --> 21:34.367
by the Ministry
of Health.

21:34.400 --> 21:35.667
Well, you didn't have
the resources

21:35.700 --> 21:37.400
to include her
in your study, so...

21:37.433 --> 21:39.367
AZT, 3TC?
Yeah, and Nelfinavir.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.000
And that cost you...
thousand dollars a month?

21:43.033 --> 21:44.867
Twelve hundred.

21:44.900 --> 21:47.400
Where'd you
get the money?

21:47.433 --> 21:50.000
Um... I paid for it.

21:50.033 --> 21:51.933
Yourself?

21:51.967 --> 21:54.133
( scoffs )

21:54.167 --> 21:56.800
I could treat four
patients for a year

21:56.833 --> 21:59.500
with what you're
spending on your
patient every month.

21:59.533 --> 22:00.967
It took me two years

22:01.000 --> 22:02.533
to get all the
approvals necessary

22:02.567 --> 22:04.567
to import the drugs,

22:04.600 --> 22:06.433
arrange the funding
and staff, and you're

22:06.467 --> 22:07.767
jeopardizing it

22:07.800 --> 22:09.300
Whoa...
by pulling out
your checkbook

22:09.333 --> 22:10.567
and sending
them in by post.

22:10.600 --> 22:11.767
How am I jeopardizing
your work?

22:11.800 --> 22:14.033
It's not sustainable.

22:14.067 --> 22:16.767
What happens to that poor
woman when you leave?

22:16.800 --> 22:19.000
What, you're going
to keep shipping her
thousands of dollars

22:19.033 --> 22:20.733
worth of drugs for
the rest of her life?

22:20.767 --> 22:22.400
Uh...

22:22.433 --> 22:24.233
Yeah, I was planning
on it, yeah.

22:24.267 --> 22:26.967
And who's going to
monitor her progress,

22:27.000 --> 22:28.633
make sure she
remains compliant?

22:28.667 --> 22:30.433
You know, what if one
of her kids get sick...

22:30.467 --> 22:31.800
Well, that's...
...and she decides

22:31.833 --> 22:33.467
to split her meds
with the child?

22:33.500 --> 22:34.633
It happens!
Yeah.

22:34.667 --> 22:36.400
Or if she moves
back to Kivo?

22:36.433 --> 22:38.800
Is your Mr. FedEx
going to chase all
over the Eastern Congo

22:38.833 --> 22:40.467
tracking down
your one patient?

22:40.500 --> 22:43.367
What is going to happen
to your patients
when your funding ends?

22:43.400 --> 22:46.800
You cannot start
a patient on drugs
without guaranteeing

22:46.833 --> 22:47.900
you can maintain
a supply.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.467
What, and you can guarantee
a supply?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.967
Yes. I'm trying to
show my government

22:52.000 --> 22:55.533
and the international
community that ARV
therapy works here,

22:55.567 --> 22:57.533
and when they see our
success, they'll realize

22:57.567 --> 22:59.467
we can save
millions of lives.

22:59.500 --> 23:02.533
I'm just trying to save one.

23:02.567 --> 23:05.067
One's not enough!

23:07.900 --> 23:09.767
You want me to walk you home?

23:17.600 --> 23:19.567
Oh, it's just mild jaundice.

23:19.600 --> 23:20.933
Three Fansidar tablets,
and tell her

23:20.967 --> 23:22.833
if she's not feeling better
in a couple days,

23:22.867 --> 23:25.033
just come back.
Okay. C'est
le paludisme.

23:25.067 --> 23:27.567
Si ça ne va pas
mieux dans quelques
jours, revenez.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.133
Bonjour. Comment vous
sentez-vous aujourd'hui?

23:29.167 --> 23:30.400
Dr. John.

23:30.433 --> 23:32.567
Ms. Likasu is here from
the Ministry of Health.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.133
She was looking for
your HIV patient.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.233
Celine?

23:35.267 --> 23:37.433
She was quite
insistent.

23:37.467 --> 23:38.567
Did you tell her
where she was?

23:38.600 --> 23:39.767
She went to Angelique.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.733
They're already
on the ward.

23:48.833 --> 23:52.833
( speaking in French )

23:52.867 --> 23:54.000
What's going on?

23:54.033 --> 23:56.167
You shipped in drugs.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.367
Merci, Celine.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.200
Je la prends
pour l'étude.

24:00.233 --> 24:02.400
Il faudriat qu'elle
vienne á l'hôpital Mardi,

24:02.433 --> 24:03.400
dans la journée.

24:03.433 --> 24:04.533
Okay, sure.

24:04.567 --> 24:06.400
Okay, what, what?

24:06.433 --> 24:09.400
I'm enrolling Celine
in my pilot program.

24:09.433 --> 24:11.533
I thought you were full.

24:11.567 --> 24:12.600
Yeah, I was.

24:12.633 --> 24:14.500
Thanks, Angelique.
Au revoir.

24:14.533 --> 24:16.867
So, what happened?

24:16.900 --> 24:18.700
I met this
rich American

24:18.733 --> 24:20.867
who can afford to
commit $15,000 a year

24:20.900 --> 24:23.400
to my study for the
next five years.

24:23.433 --> 24:25.367
You can afford that,
can't you?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.067
Yeah, sure.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.467
So that means
I have funding

24:28.500 --> 24:30.200
for 40 additional
participants,

24:30.233 --> 24:32.533
and your patient seemed
like the perfect
place to start.

24:32.567 --> 24:35.200
What about her two kids?

24:39.567 --> 24:41.900
Don't push your
luck, Doctor.

24:41.933 --> 24:43.467
Thank you.

25:04.033 --> 25:05.500
Look, I said I looked
in the records room,

25:05.533 --> 25:06.500
and it's not there.

25:06.533 --> 25:07.733
Yeah, well Happy
Thanksgiving

25:07.767 --> 25:09.700
to you, too,
jagoff.

25:09.733 --> 25:11.200
Hey, did
Detroit win?
I have no freaking idea.

25:11.233 --> 25:12.667
Well, what about Dallas?

25:12.700 --> 25:15.167
Don't make me come over
there and smack you.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.600
Are those from Christmas?

25:16.633 --> 25:17.933
Uh, last year?

25:17.967 --> 25:19.500
The year before.
Dr. Greene.

25:19.533 --> 25:21.100
Mm.
Which one's
Dr. Greene?

25:21.133 --> 25:22.967
I'm going to
need a massive
amount of caffeine

25:23.000 --> 25:24.733
if I'm going
to make it to sunrise.

25:24.767 --> 25:26.000
Here you go, Abby.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.600
Ugh!

25:27.633 --> 25:28.900
( laughter )

25:28.933 --> 25:30.100
Shred it.

25:30.133 --> 25:31.100
Oh, look at this one.

25:31.133 --> 25:32.100
That's definitely 2001.

25:32.133 --> 25:33.100
The Secret Santa party.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.600
Anybody hear from Carter?

25:35.633 --> 25:37.433
He sent us a postcard
about a month ago.

25:37.467 --> 25:39.000
You should put that up
in the lounge.

25:39.033 --> 25:40.200
How's he doing?

25:40.233 --> 25:42.167
I don't know.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.933
Why did you
come back?

25:45.967 --> 25:47.933
Hmm?

25:49.300 --> 25:52.033
Well, you were raised
in Paris and London.

25:53.367 --> 25:54.733
After you got
your degree,

25:54.767 --> 25:57.033
why didn't you come
back to the Congo?

26:00.500 --> 26:02.833
My father was killed,

26:02.867 --> 26:06.500
so I came back
to settle his affairs.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.900
How was he killed?

26:12.767 --> 26:15.100
He was on his way from...

26:16.600 --> 26:18.700
Manono to Kabineta,

26:18.733 --> 26:21.533
and his car was ambushed

26:21.567 --> 26:25.100
by rebels and CLF soldiers.

26:29.300 --> 26:31.667
I'm so sorry.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.667
He was an engineer.

26:41.967 --> 26:43.867
He worked 30 years

26:43.900 --> 26:47.067
trying to upgrade
the water supply

26:47.100 --> 26:49.033
in Kivo and Katanga.

26:51.100 --> 26:55.433
But he was a Banyamulenge
driving in a Mai Mai area,

26:57.267 --> 27:01.000
so they pulled him from his car
and shot him in the head.

27:07.067 --> 27:10.200
He believed in the goodness
of people.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.500
I came back for him.

27:21.733 --> 27:24.500
( applause and cheering )

27:26.300 --> 27:29.067
Prets? Et partez!

27:37.233 --> 27:39.767
Go, go, go, go!

27:44.867 --> 27:47.800
Vite, vite,
vite, vite!

27:50.067 --> 27:51.933
Vite, vite, vite, vite!

27:53.667 --> 27:55.367
You are the winner!

27:55.400 --> 27:57.233
J'ai gagné!

27:57.267 --> 27:58.567
( applause and cheering )

27:58.600 --> 28:00.133
J'ai gagné!

28:00.167 --> 28:02.467
Oui, tu as gagné!

28:02.500 --> 28:04.533
( laughs )

28:04.567 --> 28:06.700
Whoa.

28:06.733 --> 28:08.100
( laughing )

28:09.700 --> 28:11.100
Here he is.

28:11.133 --> 28:11.767
Hey.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.233
You need a helmet?

28:13.267 --> 28:15.133
( laughs )

28:15.167 --> 28:18.133
Oh, probably.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.567
What's the matter?

28:19.600 --> 28:21.400
Celine didn't show up
at the clinic

28:21.433 --> 28:22.967
this morning
for her testing.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.067
( groans )

28:26.133 --> 28:27.933
( sighs )

28:27.967 --> 28:30.533
CARTER:
So, when was the last time
she came in?

28:30.567 --> 28:33.233
KEM:
Two weeks ago, just
after her husband died.

28:33.267 --> 28:35.633
And her lymphocyte
count was still good?

28:35.667 --> 28:37.867
Yup, it was excellent.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.500
Something must
have happened.

28:39.533 --> 28:40.933
She knows
she's supposed

28:40.967 --> 28:42.833
to be monitored.

28:42.867 --> 28:44.867
So, how are we going
to find her?

28:44.900 --> 28:47.333
She'll be with people
from her village.

28:47.367 --> 28:49.567
How are we going
to find them?

28:51.100 --> 28:53.033
We ask.

29:22.100 --> 29:24.533
When did you first notice
he was sick?

29:24.567 --> 29:25.700
A week ago.

29:25.733 --> 29:26.867
Has he been
coughing?

29:26.900 --> 29:29.467
Yes, but nothing is coming out.

29:29.500 --> 29:30.933
Shortness of breath?

29:30.967 --> 29:32.667
( breathes quick,
rapid breaths )

29:32.700 --> 29:34.067
He cannot run.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.367
He gets very tired.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.167
I know I was supposed
to come to the clinic yesterday,

29:37.200 --> 29:39.667
but I wanted to wait
till he was feeling much better.

29:39.700 --> 29:42.300
I have been taking my medicine

29:42.333 --> 29:44.000
every day.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.167
He...

29:45.200 --> 29:46.433
( weakly ):
He...

29:46.467 --> 29:48.133
He...

29:48.167 --> 29:49.600
He...

29:50.867 --> 29:53.200
I would start him
on high dose trimethoprim-sulfa.

29:53.233 --> 29:55.100
20 milligrams per kilo per day

29:55.133 --> 29:56.333
divided q six hours.

29:56.367 --> 29:58.400
Prednisone
ten milligrams
twice a day.

29:58.433 --> 29:59.933
How are we
set for oxygen?

29:59.967 --> 30:01.967
Not good.
All right, hold off
on the O2 for now.

30:02.000 --> 30:02.967
Is it the AIDS?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.833
He has Pneumocystis
pneumonia.

30:04.867 --> 30:07.533
It's an infection
that can take hold

30:07.567 --> 30:09.833
if the immune system
is weakened.

30:09.867 --> 30:11.333
Will he get better?

30:11.367 --> 30:12.900
I hope so.

30:12.933 --> 30:15.067
We're going to give him medicine
and see how he does.

30:15.100 --> 30:17.433
He looks so small...

30:17.467 --> 30:19.833
and sick.

30:21.967 --> 30:24.000
I only slept with my husband.

30:24.033 --> 30:26.000
No one else, ever.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.967
( rain pouring down )

30:43.267 --> 30:45.100
How bad?

30:47.567 --> 30:49.533
Well,

30:49.567 --> 30:51.533
if he gets
through the pneumonia,

30:51.567 --> 30:52.933
he's going to need ARVs.

30:52.967 --> 30:55.900
Do you have
the pediatric suspensions?

30:55.933 --> 30:56.900
No.

30:56.933 --> 30:58.600
We can grind up
the adult tablets.

30:58.633 --> 31:01.367
I can figure out the dosage
for a five-year-old.

31:01.400 --> 31:02.733
No.

31:04.933 --> 31:06.500
That little boy's going to die.

31:06.533 --> 31:09.200
Yeah.

31:09.233 --> 31:10.867
And you can just stand there,
not doing anything?

31:10.900 --> 31:13.100
You can just let that happen?
I don't...

31:13.133 --> 31:14.100
What?

31:14.133 --> 31:15.500
I am doing something.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.033
I'm proving drug
therapy works

31:17.067 --> 31:19.133
so we can save
1,000 little boys,

31:19.167 --> 31:20.300
50,000.

31:20.333 --> 31:21.867
Then help me save this one.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.233
Don't you
yell at me.

31:23.267 --> 31:26.367
You go home, you yell
at your president.

31:26.400 --> 31:27.833
You yell at your
government.

31:27.867 --> 31:29.900
You tell them that
we need real money.

31:29.933 --> 31:31.333
Not just these
empty promises.

31:31.367 --> 31:33.600
You tell them,
6,000 people are
dying out here.

31:33.633 --> 31:34.733
Damn it! Damn it!

31:34.767 --> 31:35.867
Every day,
and they have

31:35.900 --> 31:37.033
to do something
about it.

31:37.067 --> 31:41.833
( yelling )

31:59.133 --> 32:01.967
Hey.

32:02.000 --> 32:03.100
How are you?

32:03.133 --> 32:05.067
Great.

32:08.133 --> 32:09.600
You still mad?

32:09.633 --> 32:12.033
I wasn't mad.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.900
Well, Charles tells me

32:15.933 --> 32:18.167
that you're going
to take a C-140 flight

32:18.200 --> 32:20.867
into Kinshasa to get a couple
more tons of rice.

32:20.900 --> 32:22.400
No. It's MONUC's plane.

32:22.433 --> 32:23.767
I'm just along
for the ride.

32:23.800 --> 32:27.400
Well, it occurred to me
that I might be able

32:27.433 --> 32:30.033
to talk you
into picking up a few things

32:30.067 --> 32:31.200
for me in the capital?

32:33.567 --> 32:34.767
Like what?

32:34.800 --> 32:38.067
Oh, Christmas decorations.

32:38.100 --> 32:41.967
You know, tree, lights,
ornaments, tinsel.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.100
Tinsel?

32:43.133 --> 32:45.833
Santa suit, snow globes,
that sort of thing.

32:47.700 --> 32:51.367
Oh, and a couple
of cylinders of oxygen.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.600
Oxygen.

32:52.633 --> 32:54.233
Yeah, you know,
if you could find any.

32:54.267 --> 32:56.200
I made a list.

33:07.867 --> 33:09.033
Hey.

33:09.067 --> 33:11.433
Hey.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.933
What are you doing?

33:12.967 --> 33:14.833
Oh, just wrapping a
few Christmas presents

33:14.867 --> 33:17.100
for some friends
back home.

33:17.133 --> 33:18.267
Bangala.

33:18.300 --> 33:19.467
Mm.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.800
Hope you didn't pay too much
for it.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.167
No, it was cheap.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.333
50 bucks.

33:23.367 --> 33:24.600
What?

33:24.633 --> 33:25.967
Just kidding.

33:26.000 --> 33:26.933
It was three.

33:26.967 --> 33:28.100
Oh.

33:28.133 --> 33:29.733
( laughs )

33:29.767 --> 33:31.000
How was your day?

33:31.033 --> 33:33.100
Oh, endless.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.000
Who's Abby?

33:38.567 --> 33:42.333
She's a, you know, friend.

33:42.367 --> 33:44.633
Really?

33:46.200 --> 33:48.133
I hope she still is.

33:49.433 --> 33:50.600
Why, are you jealous?

33:51.900 --> 33:53.933
A bit.

33:53.967 --> 33:56.600
( chuckles )

33:59.567 --> 34:02.133
I think I might be pregnant.

34:14.100 --> 34:16.233
What?

34:16.266 --> 34:18.033
( laughs )

34:18.067 --> 34:18.933
How?

34:18.967 --> 34:23.033
Uh... when
did, uh, uh...?

34:23.067 --> 34:26.033
Oh, yeah.

34:26.067 --> 34:27.266
Mm-hmm.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.233
Hmm.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.233
Are you angry?

34:38.067 --> 34:40.033
No.

34:41.132 --> 34:43.533
You're upset?

34:47.067 --> 34:49.132
No.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.199
You?

34:55.233 --> 34:58.567
I... I thought I would be,
but it's strange.

34:58.600 --> 35:00.667
I think I might be happy.

35:09.100 --> 35:10.733
Do you want to
have a baby?

35:10.767 --> 35:12.900
I don't know.
Do you?

35:12.933 --> 35:14.867
You first.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.967
Uh, I've got my program...

35:18.000 --> 35:20.833
and we barely
know each other.

35:20.867 --> 35:24.033
It's been what,
six hours?

35:24.067 --> 35:25.900
Six weeks.

35:30.567 --> 35:33.600
Oh, God, I'm really in trouble.

35:33.633 --> 35:38.633
( laughs )

35:47.033 --> 35:50.633
( loud retching )

35:59.233 --> 36:00.633
Getting bad out there?

36:00.667 --> 36:01.867
Yes.

36:01.900 --> 36:03.200
Merry Christmas Eve, huh?

36:03.233 --> 36:05.900
If you say so.

36:05.933 --> 36:07.333
VALERIE:
Hey, Greg.

36:07.367 --> 36:09.367
Hey, Valerie,
how you doing?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.467
Good. Just ready
for the holidays.

36:11.500 --> 36:12.367
Yeah, me, too.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.900
Except
I've got to work.

36:13.933 --> 36:15.233
Too bad.

36:15.267 --> 36:16.533
You waiting for Mike?

36:16.567 --> 36:18.300
Yeah, he's supposed
to be off

36:18.333 --> 36:19.967
in a couple of minutes.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.800
All right then, Merry Christmas.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.300
Yeah.

36:25.333 --> 36:26.833
FRANK:
Merry Christmas,
everybody!

36:26.867 --> 36:28.233
Hey, what the hell is that?
Welcome to Calcutta!

36:28.267 --> 36:30.167
Come on, that's it.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.300
Hey, what is that?

36:31.333 --> 36:33.467
A little bit
of Sikh rap.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.667
Sikh rap?

36:34.700 --> 36:36.233
Are you ready to go?

36:36.267 --> 36:37.567
No, keep dancing.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.433
She's good.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.033
I found six tanks,
but the pilot

36:45.067 --> 36:47.000
couldn't handle
the extra weight.

36:47.033 --> 36:49.200
He only let me
bring on these three.

36:49.233 --> 36:51.133
Bilateral
interstitial infiltrates

36:51.167 --> 36:52.733
and a high LDH.

36:52.767 --> 36:55.733
Yeah. We've got him
on IV Bactrim and steroids.

36:55.767 --> 36:57.267
Pulse ox on O2
is only 78.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.833
Is he not getting any better?

36:59.867 --> 37:03.667
He should, uh,
be resting more
comfortably now

37:03.700 --> 37:05.133
with the oxygen.

37:08.300 --> 37:09.400
How about the other stuff?

37:09.433 --> 37:10.533
I found a couple
of things.

37:10.567 --> 37:11.900
Dumped them
in the hallway.

37:11.933 --> 37:14.300
Yeah? Decorations, ornaments,
that kind of thing?

37:14.333 --> 37:15.967
Someone offered to
sell me a fruitcake.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.467
You like fruitcake?

37:17.500 --> 37:20.100
That's it-- you didn't get
any, like, decorations

37:20.133 --> 37:21.333
or tinsel
or a garland?

37:21.367 --> 37:22.800
I did the best I could do.

37:22.833 --> 37:24.567
Whoa!

37:24.600 --> 37:28.067
( laughing ):
All right!

37:28.100 --> 37:29.333
Oh, it's fantastic.

37:29.367 --> 37:30.733
Where did you get
all this stuff?

37:30.767 --> 37:32.267
American Embassy.

37:32.300 --> 37:34.167
They had a bunch of their old
junk in the basement.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.633
Oh, my... oh!

37:35.667 --> 37:37.033
( laughing )

37:37.067 --> 37:39.233
Friends back home
sent all this?

37:39.267 --> 37:42.033
Yeah, the ER staff
where I worked.

37:42.067 --> 37:44.700
I asked everybody
to get one gift--

37:44.733 --> 37:45.867
nothing over $20.

37:45.900 --> 37:48.200
Looks like
everybody chipped in.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.933
How did they know
what to give who?

37:50.967 --> 37:52.400
They were supposed to...

37:52.433 --> 37:54.900
Here, they wrote
on the back, see?

37:54.933 --> 37:56.700
Appropriate age--
boy, girl.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.100
Should be a few in here
for the adults, too.

37:59.133 --> 38:00.533
Package in here
for you, John.

38:03.300 --> 38:06.433
Wow, this
one's heavy.

38:08.233 --> 38:10.933
Looks like some
kind of doll.

38:10.967 --> 38:13.200
What'd you get?

38:13.233 --> 38:17.433
It is a card from work
that everybody signed.

38:17.467 --> 38:20.333
What's Martin, Hall and Jacobs?

38:20.367 --> 38:24.833
Uh, that is a, uh, a law firm
back home.

38:24.867 --> 38:26.633
It's marked "urgent."

38:26.667 --> 38:28.933
Oh, my God.

38:28.967 --> 38:30.800
What?

38:30.833 --> 38:32.767
Dr. Romano died.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.500
Was he a friend?

38:34.533 --> 38:37.767
Um... no.

38:37.800 --> 38:39.100
No, not really.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.433
It's beautiful, isn't it?

38:46.600 --> 38:50.033
Yeah. It really is.

38:59.033 --> 39:01.733
Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas!

39:09.667 --> 39:12.300
Merry Christmas.

39:12.333 --> 39:13.800
Oh, oh, careful.

39:13.833 --> 39:15.633
Got it?

39:16.767 --> 39:18.733
Merry Christmas.

39:20.733 --> 39:22.400
Read the labels.

39:31.433 --> 39:33.367
Okay, three-year-old boy.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.433
Three-year...

39:34.467 --> 39:35.733
You want another one?

39:35.767 --> 39:37.700
You know what?

39:39.767 --> 39:41.000
Keep going.

39:41.033 --> 39:42.533
I'll be right back.

39:56.767 --> 39:59.033
Joyeux Noel, Celine.

39:59.067 --> 40:01.200
Joyeux Noel.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.667
He hasn't woken up
this morning.

40:09.700 --> 40:12.933
His oxygen level is too low.

40:16.933 --> 40:19.333
Will he ever wake up?

40:21.433 --> 40:24.433
No. I don't think so.

40:35.533 --> 40:38.500
I brought some presents
for your kids from the party.

40:38.533 --> 40:41.533
This is for your little girl.

40:46.167 --> 40:49.067
And this is for the baby.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.233
And this is for Lamia.

40:52.900 --> 40:55.267
Shall I open it for him?

40:57.000 --> 40:59.733
I think
it's a truck.

41:14.067 --> 41:15.867
Thank you.

41:35.733 --> 41:38.733
Merry Christmas.

41:38.767 --> 41:42.333
Merry Christmas.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.133
Oh...

42:10.167 --> 42:13.667
They were mine
when I was little.

42:15.333 --> 42:16.900
Thank you.

42:16.933 --> 42:18.700
There's more.

42:27.833 --> 42:30.833
I want you to come back
to the States with me.

42:36.633 --> 42:39.600
I want our baby
to be born in America.

42:42.800 --> 42:46.267
Oh...

42:48.200 --> 42:50.900
I have to go back.

42:50.933 --> 42:55.167
That, um... package, the
envelope from the law firm

42:55.200 --> 42:57.133
that you were
asking me about.

42:57.167 --> 42:58.967
I used to get them
every few months,

42:59.000 --> 43:01.767
then it was every
few weeks, now it's
every few days.

43:01.800 --> 43:06.067
It's just something that
I have to take care of.

43:06.100 --> 43:08.067
Are you in some kind of trouble?

43:08.100 --> 43:10.533
( chuckling )

43:10.567 --> 43:12.700
No.

43:12.733 --> 43:16.167
No, it's nothing
like that. Um...

43:16.200 --> 43:18.433
My grandmother died
nine months ago,

43:18.467 --> 43:21.933
and I have to
settle her estate.

43:21.967 --> 43:25.167
Just some financial things
that I have to deal with.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.800
I kind of ran away
after she died.

43:27.833 --> 43:29.900
You ran away from what?

43:32.767 --> 43:34.100
Myself.

43:34.133 --> 43:35.567
( chuckling )

43:37.300 --> 43:39.233
Responsibility. Um...

43:39.267 --> 43:41.233
It's hard to explain.

43:41.267 --> 43:44.367
I wasn't happy.

43:44.400 --> 43:47.333
Something was missing
in my life.

43:50.233 --> 43:52.767
I can't leave.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.467
My work is here,

43:54.500 --> 43:57.633
and it's my life, you know?

43:57.667 --> 43:59.300
I know.

43:59.333 --> 44:01.433
I don't expect you
to leave forever.

44:01.467 --> 44:03.833
Come for a couple weeks,
a month, two.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.867
Meet my friends.

44:07.900 --> 44:11.667
See my life there.

44:11.700 --> 44:14.433
You'll get the
best prenatal care.

44:14.467 --> 44:16.500
Your program's
up and running.

44:16.533 --> 44:18.433
You've got a
great staff.

44:18.467 --> 44:21.533
They'll be okay
without you for awhile.

44:21.567 --> 44:24.067
How long
do you have to stay?

44:24.100 --> 44:26.167
I don't know...

44:26.200 --> 44:28.433
but we'll figure
it out together.

44:37.167 --> 44:42.000
What was missing in my life...

44:42.033 --> 44:44.333
isn't missing anymore.
