WEBVTT

00:03.860 --> 00:05.743
Previously on E.R...

00:05.751 --> 00:07.143
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

00:07.147 --> 00:09.608
- And thank you for the hot dog.
- It's my pleasure.

00:12.482 --> 00:14.526
- This is my brother, Chaz.
- How you doing?

00:14.533 --> 00:16.506
- You, uh, moving in?
- Yeah.

00:16.517 --> 00:20.083
Up at First Mission Baptist, Pastor Watkins
does a drug exchange program.

00:20.092 --> 00:23.120
What you're doing is dangerous,
okay, not to mention illegal.

00:23.128 --> 00:25.713
That TV news gal, Courtney Brown,
called again.

00:25.723 --> 00:28.334
Oh, Channel 5 Courtney Brown?
What did she want?

00:28.385 --> 00:30.040
She offered me a job as a reporter.

00:30.044 --> 00:33.531
Figured it was about time someone put
something worthwhile on television.

00:33.531 --> 00:35.678
I called you the other night,

00:35.680 --> 00:38.922
- and a woman answered.
- Yeah, I can explain that.

00:44.239 --> 00:46.750
Rise and shine, Mayday.
Too early to be taking a nap.

00:46.876 --> 00:49.910
- Is it morning already?
- Yep. Has been for awhile.

00:50.378 --> 00:54.353
Crenshaw's been running me ragged.
I've been on since midnight Tuesday.

00:54.577 --> 00:56.800
No wonder you haven't return my calls.

00:57.027 --> 00:59.810
Surgery is not for sissies.

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:10.436 --> 01:14.112
Listen, I want to talk to you about
our mutual groping after the M&M.

01:14.128 --> 01:15.791
- That was a mistake.
- Yeah.

01:17.726 --> 01:19.380
You live with someone.

01:20.085 --> 01:22.913
Yes, but not exactly.

01:23.468 --> 01:26.952
- And there's a little girl.
- Right.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.622
Nice kid, not mine.

01:30.036 --> 01:32.893
- Her father is my friend.
- In the Gulf?

01:34.206 --> 01:35.202
Yep.

01:35.477 --> 01:37.540
After we came back,
he couldn't keep it together.

01:37.558 --> 01:40.272
I always told him that
if something happened,

01:40.285 --> 01:43.011
I would make sure that Sarah
and Meg made it through.

01:44.306 --> 01:45.971
That's a big promise.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.813
I always say, "Go big or go home."

01:55.275 --> 01:56.772
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:56.976 --> 02:00.302
Gates, your DVT patient is still waiting
on a ride to oncology.

02:00.316 --> 02:01.643
And the nurses started a pool

02:01.657 --> 02:04.110
on when somebody's going to finally
tap your ascites guy's belly.

02:04.127 --> 02:08.050
All right, I'll go take care
of the DVT guy first.

02:13.208 --> 02:14.852
Ambulance on its way in.

02:14.867 --> 02:17.870
Uh, stab wound, slash, OD...
nine minutes out.

02:18.296 --> 02:19.881
Wake me up in eight.

02:20.325 --> 02:23.160
Whenever I move my head,
everything spins.

02:23.475 --> 02:25.603
My nephew says it's a tumor.

02:25.918 --> 02:30.053
Well, your neuro exam's normal, ma'am, so
it's not a brain tumor, it's not a stroke.

02:30.058 --> 02:31.200
Stroke?

02:31.216 --> 02:33.750
This is meclizine. You're going to take
one every eight hours if you get dizzy.

02:33.765 --> 02:37.071
Now, when you run out, you can fill
this for a month's supply.

02:37.188 --> 02:39.703
- I take that to the pharmacy?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:39.876 --> 02:41.193
And I have to pay?

02:41.198 --> 02:42.903
Yeah, but your insurance
will cover some of it.

02:42.915 --> 02:44.352
- Dr. Pratt?
- There you go.

02:44.985 --> 02:46.170
Excuse me.

02:48.107 --> 02:49.080
Yeah?

02:50.977 --> 02:53.623
Mrs. Skinner's BP's 185/100.

02:53.638 --> 02:55.343
She take the Lameretic I gave her?

02:55.508 --> 02:57.073
Sure, until she used up the samples.

02:57.105 --> 03:00.662
- What about the prescription?
- It's $60 for a month's supply.

03:00.678 --> 03:04.393
She's saving up, but hopes her son will
send her a check by Thanksgiving.

03:04.555 --> 03:08.132
I'm going out of my way
to get your people set up right.

03:08.135 --> 03:10.142
You gotta help make sure
they stay on the program.

03:10.428 --> 03:12.382
All I need's an extra
hundred grand a year.

03:12.405 --> 03:14.862
I think that'll cover the cost
for my congregation.

03:14.907 --> 03:17.523
So what? I need to figure out
a way to pay for all this, too?

03:17.536 --> 03:19.310
Hey, in for a penny, in for a pound.

03:19.778 --> 03:23.341
- Who said that-- Jesus?
- Clemens Daniel III.

03:23.688 --> 03:24.822
My bookie.

03:27.606 --> 03:29.691
Don't let me get wet, Teller,
the water burns.

03:29.715 --> 03:31.870
- Gotta make sure they see him.
- Please, don't leave me.

03:31.886 --> 03:33.701
We'll get in trouble.

03:33.816 --> 03:36.462
Them demons come through
the sewers when it rains.

03:39.198 --> 03:40.493
Ah, she's here.

03:41.077 --> 03:43.412
- It's Bloody Mary.
- Let go, let go, it's her.

03:43.427 --> 03:45.382
It's okay.
You know what to do.

03:46.718 --> 03:49.971
- No, she sees us, it's too late.
- Do it, Paulie.

03:50.007 --> 03:53.361
One, two, three, four,
stay away forevermore.

03:54.708 --> 03:55.803
See?

03:57.927 --> 03:59.113
She can't hurt us.

04:11.768 --> 04:14.703
- You kids okay?
- Let's go, Teller. He's a doctor.

04:14.716 --> 04:16.642
- Did she get Narcan?
- No response.

04:17.426 --> 04:20.093
- Teller! We have to go back.
- What happened?

04:20.404 --> 04:23.010
- To his ear, what happened?
- He climbed over a fence.

04:23.038 --> 04:24.402
- Did he fall?
- I'll be good now.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.423
- Probably.
- Hit his head?

04:26.427 --> 04:27.462
Maybe.

04:27.465 --> 04:31.431
Get me a gurney, a backboard, and
a C-collar, blunt trauma to the head.

04:31.447 --> 04:33.761
Page surgery, ENT and hold CT.

04:34.677 --> 04:38.133
- I'll come in soon as I'm done.
- All right. Thanks, Mayday.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.570
There be demons on the Hancock.
You can see them from the lake.

04:41.588 --> 04:45.002
- Shut up, Paulie, they don't know.
- Couple Ativan to calm him down.

04:45.246 --> 04:47.632
- What do you want to do about the ear?
- Uh... Unasyn? Two grams?

04:47.646 --> 04:49.411
Try three, irrigate the hell out of it.

04:49.415 --> 04:51.831
- Plastics will do a flap in the OR.
- Sats are good.

04:51.876 --> 04:55.502
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- Pinpoint pupils. She had Narcan?

04:55.525 --> 04:57.810
- Only point eight.
- All right, let's try two milligrams.

04:57.827 --> 04:59.172
Sometimes they need more.

04:59.188 --> 05:01.600
No wounds to the anterior chest
or abdomen.

05:01.617 --> 05:05.573
- Corneal reflexes are... intact.
- Chest is clear.

05:06.075 --> 05:09.781
- Belly is soft, non-tender.
- Tachy at 120.

05:10.738 --> 05:12.132
Looks like you got her back.

05:12.246 --> 05:15.403
- Oh, my God.
- Deep breaths for me now. In...

05:16.817 --> 05:19.091
One percent lido and update his tetanus.

05:19.856 --> 05:21.490
It's going to be okay, Paulie.

05:21.668 --> 05:24.722
You're gonna be okay.
The Blue Lady's here.

05:37.477 --> 05:40.530
Yeah. I running around all shift,
and I never got to it.

05:41.005 --> 05:43.933
I was coming off an overnight,
and I figured Gates could handle it.

05:43.947 --> 05:47.002
He didn't and now he can't.
He's in with a trauma.

05:47.215 --> 05:49.701
Well, it's just a paracentesis--
maybe you could do it.

05:49.775 --> 05:53.023
Look, you're an attending.
You shouldn't have left this unfinished.

05:53.418 --> 05:55.403
Look, I had somewhere to be, okay?

05:55.426 --> 05:59.082
What was so important that you'd walk out
on a guy who'd been here all night?

05:59.788 --> 06:03.121
Church. All right?
I had to go to church.

06:03.506 --> 06:08.563
Pratt, you're a terrible liar. Get back
here and deal with this right now, okay?

06:10.978 --> 06:12.712
Hey. Hey!

06:13.156 --> 06:15.773
What are you doing, you chipping in
on the water bill, 'cause I need...

06:16.806 --> 06:17.923
Hey, Greg.

06:21.676 --> 06:24.052
- I thought you were at work.
- Is this your brother?

06:24.577 --> 06:25.513
Yeah.

06:27.006 --> 06:28.770
Get out of here.
No, Greg, listen...

06:28.777 --> 06:30.421
Hey, get the hell out of here.

06:39.537 --> 06:40.703
You, too.

06:42.718 --> 06:44.953
By the time I get back, I want you gone.

06:51.576 --> 06:53.491
Let go!
Why you wanna kill me?

06:53.515 --> 06:56.573
- Stop it, or she ain't gonna come.
- Are we charting this as a John Doe?

06:56.678 --> 06:59.472
- I told you, his name's Paulie.
- Paulie what?

06:59.486 --> 07:00.833
Does he have any parents?

07:01.215 --> 07:03.962
His father's locked up
in the tower by the water.

07:04.578 --> 07:07.141
His mom was in the shelter
before she died.

07:07.406 --> 07:10.170
Paulie left so they couldn't send him
to the Foresters.

07:10.186 --> 07:11.381
Foresters?

07:11.875 --> 07:13.970
The fake family
that don't ever love you.

07:14.007 --> 07:16.421
- A foster family?
- Where does he live?

07:16.438 --> 07:17.473
Under.

07:18.095 --> 07:19.881
- Under what?
- How's it here?

07:19.978 --> 07:23.841
Altered after a ten-foot fall.
No ID, history unknown.

07:23.856 --> 07:27.540
C-spine and, uh, and chest are clear.
Lose the collar, will ya?

07:27.606 --> 07:29.661
- Head CT films.
- I don't want to stay here.

07:29.677 --> 07:32.133
- Look... look.
- How about another two of Ativan?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.170
No bleed or fracture.
What about drugs?

07:34.185 --> 07:36.720
Tox screen negative for alcohol
and drugs of abuse.

07:36.755 --> 07:38.142
- Any fever?
- 98.6.

07:38.178 --> 07:41.201
- I don't get why he's so altered.
- Doesn't seem like meningitis.

07:41.216 --> 07:42.822
Has your friend been acting differently?

07:43.147 --> 07:46.280
- Ever since his arm started hurting.
- You mean, before he fell?

07:46.588 --> 07:49.121
- He only fell last night.
- How did he fall?

07:49.685 --> 07:51.790
We was in the building
where nobody lives.

07:52.164 --> 07:54.262
Paulie got scared 'cause of all the bats.

07:54.301 --> 07:56.818
- Bats?
- Could be rabies. Hope, page Kovac.

07:57.290 --> 07:59.762
All right, put an N-95 mask on him.

07:59.769 --> 08:02.322
If he does have rabies,
his saliva is extremely infectious.

08:02.337 --> 08:07.453
I need to check for fractures.
No step-offs or deformities.

08:08.505 --> 08:11.491
Full range of motion
at the elbow and wrist.

08:13.805 --> 08:15.150
See, Paulie?

08:15.506 --> 08:16.952
I told you she'd come.

08:20.297 --> 08:23.771
Lunchtime starts at noon, so I'll be
there with the crew by 11:00.

08:23.786 --> 08:27.290
You know, Courtney, this isn't
quite what I signed on for.

08:27.305 --> 08:30.203
I thought I'd be reporting
on topical medical issues,

08:30.218 --> 08:34.041
not doing puff pieces on Botox
and unsanitary manicures.

08:34.058 --> 08:35.732
Hey, that one was strong.

08:35.746 --> 08:39.472
People all over Chicago now think twice
before having their cuticles cut.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.820
See you at noon.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.023
This came for you special delivery.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.412
- Baby gift?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

08:49.628 --> 08:52.300
Charles Hadley,
multiple wounds after a bar fight.

08:52.625 --> 08:55.820
He passed out on the couch last night,
this morning I couldn't wake him up.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.023
Look at me, sir.

08:57.606 --> 08:59.673
Pupils equal at four millimeters.

08:59.678 --> 09:01.400
- You all right there, ma'am?
- Oh, it's nothing.

09:01.415 --> 09:04.231
- Well, we should take a look at it.
- No, no, please, I'm all right, really.

09:04.248 --> 09:08.452
CBC, chem panel, blood alcohol.
C-spine, head and facial CT.

09:08.465 --> 09:11.170
Dried blood at the left ear canal.
Positive battle sign.

09:11.185 --> 09:12.393
Have a seat.

09:13.175 --> 09:16.511
- Chest is clear.
- Abdomen soft, no rebound or guarding.

09:16.605 --> 09:19.870
- Did he do this?
- Uh, no, uh... No... He...

09:20.507 --> 09:22.090
He didn't know what he was doing.

09:22.415 --> 09:24.431
Are you saying
your husband hit you, ma'am?

09:24.528 --> 09:26.503
Uh, uh, it was an accident.

09:26.517 --> 09:29.301
I was helping him down
on the couch and he slipped.

09:29.498 --> 09:31.143
Uh, his elbow knocked me.

09:31.627 --> 09:32.880
Pelvis is stable.

09:33.176 --> 09:35.070
She's going to need a facial series.

09:35.236 --> 09:36.501
Dr. Kovac.

09:36.605 --> 09:39.242
We got a pretty sick little boy
in 2, no parents.

09:39.247 --> 09:41.911
- Just keep trying to reach them.
- We think he's homeless.

09:41.926 --> 09:44.401
Neela and Gates are worried it's rabies.

09:47.088 --> 09:49.152
Uh, you're good.
I'll be back.

09:50.135 --> 09:51.241
Rabies?

09:51.275 --> 09:53.110
He was in a building infested with bats.

09:53.128 --> 09:54.731
- How was the trauma workup?
- CT's negative,

09:54.747 --> 09:56.400
but he's altered and ataxic.

09:56.678 --> 09:59.120
A river runs through the city.

09:59.178 --> 10:02.163
On the other side's
the good streets, but

10:02.178 --> 10:04.123
- we can't get across.
- How is he doing?

10:04.138 --> 10:06.200
He's responsive,
but he's not making much sense.

10:06.216 --> 10:09.981
He's not crazy.
The stuff he's talking about is real.

10:10.226 --> 10:12.893
- You're thinking rabies?
- What else could it be?

10:12.907 --> 10:15.772
Well, encephalitis from any
of a number of viruses--

10:15.916 --> 10:19.553
West Nile, Epstein Barr, mumps,
measles, varicella, CMV.

10:19.608 --> 10:22.390
- He needs a spinal tap.
- Can we do a rabies vaccine in case?

10:22.407 --> 10:26.103
Well, if you're right, it's too late.
So, let's first confirm the diagnosis.

10:26.116 --> 10:27.712
The quickest way is a skin biopsy.

10:27.715 --> 10:31.742
Keep a mask on him, if we intubate,
you'll all need masks, gloves and goggles.

10:32.087 --> 10:35.633
- Tony, your buddy Cue Ball's leaving.
- What? He still needs an X ray.

10:35.706 --> 10:38.080
- He says he feels fine.
- You handle this, Mayday?

10:38.127 --> 10:39.270
All right, I'll be back in a second.

10:39.286 --> 10:41.853
Are you going to learn me
the hard song now?

10:41.927 --> 10:43.981
Can you hold his head for me, Teller?

10:47.338 --> 10:49.463
There, you see?
I'm just like a bouncer.

10:49.477 --> 10:52.733
- I'm the guy that gets you out of here.
- Yo, Cue Ball, where are you going?

10:53.005 --> 10:54.573
Home, man, they fixed me up.

10:54.585 --> 10:57.700
Cue Ball? Hey, I knew your parents
Eight Ball and High Ball.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.450
Your lungs sound
like a bag of potato chips.

10:59.465 --> 11:02.823
Yeah, como los nachos.
I was just translating.

11:02.827 --> 11:04.212
- Come on, I'm putting you back in here.
- No, no, no, no.

11:04.225 --> 11:06.682
- You need an X ray.
- No, man, I been here since last night.

11:06.698 --> 11:10.311
- I got places to go, people to see, baby.
- Hey, sit down, Pancho.

11:10.328 --> 11:13.360
- We'll wheel you back to Tijuana.
- I ain't Spanish, man.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.503
He's a new volunteer.
We're still training him.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.571
Gates.

11:16.608 --> 11:19.162
Oh, here comes your pimp.
I'm done with this.

11:19.175 --> 11:21.313
Cue Ball, get back here, come on!

11:21.478 --> 11:23.120
- One X ray, Cue Ball!
- Hey...

11:23.128 --> 11:23.851
What?

11:23.866 --> 11:26.283
Why didn't you tap my ascites
guy's belly like I asked?

11:26.308 --> 11:27.463
I was in trauma.
What was I supposed to do?

11:27.475 --> 11:28.673
What I told you.

11:28.717 --> 11:31.551
Oh, so, I'm just supposed
to take all your scut, huh?

11:31.777 --> 11:34.122
- Yo, don't turn your back on me.
- I got stuff to do.

11:34.136 --> 11:36.612
No, the only thing that you have to do,
is the stuff I tell you to do.

11:36.625 --> 11:37.820
You really don't want
to do this right now.

11:37.835 --> 11:39.471
- I don't want to do what?
- Get in my face.

11:39.486 --> 11:41.960
Then stop acting like
you don't hear me when I talk.

11:44.107 --> 11:46.021
You want to have a job this afternoon?

11:46.338 --> 11:47.923
You better stay where you are.

11:57.245 --> 11:58.892
Can you touch your nose for me?

11:59.857 --> 12:01.363
Paulie, can you hear me?

12:01.658 --> 12:04.023
If you can hear me,
can you touch your nose?

12:17.806 --> 12:18.902
How's he doing?

12:18.925 --> 12:21.321
Intention tremor
with worsening ataxia.

12:22.295 --> 12:23.381
Bit my lip.

12:23.398 --> 12:26.601
Skin biopsy came back positive
for rabies by DFA.

12:26.616 --> 12:29.453
- Rabies is 100% fatal.
- 99.9%.

12:29.507 --> 12:32.262
There was a little girl in Wisconsin.
2004. She survived.

12:32.276 --> 12:34.990
- That was one case.
- We're going to make it two cases.

12:35.815 --> 12:38.001
- What's this?
- New England Journal of Medicine.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.322
You need to order ketamine,
midazolam, ribavirin,

12:40.338 --> 12:43.122
- and amantadine from the pharmacy.
- We're going to induce a coma?

12:43.137 --> 12:45.580
Titrate the midazolam
to suppress brain activity.

12:45.595 --> 12:47.962
Gives the brain a rest while
we administer anti-virals.

12:47.977 --> 12:51.213
Also, we need to call neurology. He's going
to need continuous EEG monitoring.

12:51.218 --> 12:54.202
There are no isolation beds in the PICU.
He's gonna have to stay down here for now.

12:54.505 --> 12:56.861
- Luka, this guy's taking a nose dive.
- I'm coming.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.860
- Did you notify public health?
- Already on it. They're bringing in CDC.

12:59.877 --> 13:00.713
Okay, good.

13:00.716 --> 13:05.383
Anyone else exposed needs rabies
prophylaxis vaccine and immune globulin.

13:06.937 --> 13:09.112
Our party animal's more disoriented.

13:09.126 --> 13:11.090
Head CT shows a basilar skull fracture.

13:11.107 --> 13:12.981
- No intracranial hemorrhage?
- We got lucky there.

13:12.998 --> 13:17.233
- GCS is down from 14 to eight.
- Mr. Hadley, open your eyes.

13:17.246 --> 13:19.582
He's diaphoretic.
Are the labs back yet?

13:19.587 --> 13:20.550
No, not yet.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.232
We need to repeat the head CT,
see if there's a delayed bleed.

13:23.248 --> 13:26.041
- Sats dropping.
- Okay, 100% non-rebreather.

13:26.057 --> 13:29.670
Dr. Kovac, some guy called a couple
of times, didn't leave a message.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.330
- Did you get a name, Frank?
- He wouldn't say.

13:32.357 --> 13:33.800
Okay, why are you telling me this, Frank?

13:33.815 --> 13:35.972
I thought you'd want to know.
It's probably a creditor.

13:35.985 --> 13:38.001
Great, thank you.
Thank you, Frank.

13:39.308 --> 13:42.011
- You doing an accu-check?
- He's not a diabetic.

13:42.035 --> 13:47.532
No, but if he's a chronic alcoholic who's
not eating, he might be hypoglycemic.

13:48.308 --> 13:50.971
- There it is-- blood sugar is 34.
- That's pretty low.

13:50.987 --> 13:53.261
Amp of D50 and 100 migs of thiamine.

13:53.276 --> 13:55.403
Yeah, I guess he's a bigger
drinker than we thought.

13:55.418 --> 13:56.872
He wasn't always this bad.

13:56.886 --> 13:59.850
Advanced liver disease diminishes
his glycogen stores.

13:59.868 --> 14:01.861
His body can't respond
to low blood sugar.

14:10.376 --> 14:12.003
What the hell is going on?

14:12.035 --> 14:14.280
Mr. Hadley, do you know where you are?

14:14.635 --> 14:17.632
- Ch-Chicago.
- You're in the hospital.

14:17.737 --> 14:19.702
When's the last time
you had something to eat?

14:19.726 --> 14:21.211
It's been a couple of days.

14:22.006 --> 14:24.550
I guess I've been
on a bit of a bender...

14:26.057 --> 14:27.491
Cancel the CT?

14:29.017 --> 14:30.050
Yeah.

14:31.405 --> 14:34.112
- Here.
- What the hell is that?

14:34.125 --> 14:36.111
It's the belly tap from my ascites guy.

14:36.125 --> 14:40.572
Send it for a cell count,
culture and cytology.

14:41.605 --> 14:44.351
Whoa, hope you didn't get
that hitting a patient.

14:44.367 --> 14:45.551
Intern.

14:46.217 --> 14:47.553
Why are you even here?

14:47.846 --> 14:50.252
Paracentesis on a pass-on
Gates couldn't handle.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.291
Uh-huh, welcome to being an attending.

14:52.575 --> 14:55.633
What, you-- you di--
you and Gates didn't--

14:55.945 --> 14:58.892
You know what?
I don't need to know.

15:00.087 --> 15:03.493
- Hey, how's the lip?
- Better than your hand. You hit like a girl.

15:03.798 --> 15:05.101
Yeah, okay.

15:05.117 --> 15:08.473
Look, I'm sorry for blowing
my cool like that.

15:08.485 --> 15:10.272
I was having a terrible morning.

15:10.346 --> 15:11.952
That's no excuse, so...

15:12.236 --> 15:14.872
if you want to file a grievance
with Human Resources,

15:14.887 --> 15:16.432
- you can call...
- I was there, too.

15:16.477 --> 15:18.773
It's not the first time I let something
like that get out of hand.

15:18.907 --> 15:22.493
Have you tried getting into a program
to help you stop drinking?

15:23.556 --> 15:27.062
Like I want to hear
everybody else's problems.

15:29.007 --> 15:33.070
What good is a lot,
a lot of talking gonna do me?

15:35.276 --> 15:37.282
Not gonna bring my son back.

15:38.706 --> 15:39.810
He died?

15:41.675 --> 15:43.371
Was a DUI.

15:44.648 --> 15:46.742
He got his mother's looks...

15:48.905 --> 15:50.763
...and my alcoholism.

15:51.226 --> 15:53.193
What about what
you're doing to your wife?

15:54.148 --> 15:56.913
I don't know
why she hasn't left me before.

15:57.936 --> 16:00.433
It should be, should be me, Doc.

16:01.286 --> 16:06.031
- Should be me that's dead, n-not Kenny.
- She came in with an injury.

16:06.646 --> 16:07.971
Did you hit her?

16:09.648 --> 16:12.083
- What?
- Did you hit her?

16:16.437 --> 16:21.372
- I would never, never hurt my wife.
- But you did.

16:23.858 --> 16:28.003
If I did, it... no.

16:32.155 --> 16:35.602
It w-wasn't on, w-w-wasn't on purpose.

16:39.777 --> 16:42.701
- I love her.
- Check his glucose in an hour.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.232
I-I love her.

16:46.577 --> 16:47.910
I'll be back.

16:52.047 --> 16:55.833
Do you think the concussion and the low
blood sugar contributed to this?

16:55.847 --> 16:57.032
To what?

16:57.048 --> 16:59.850
Well, I think he's altered,
and he hurt her accidentally.

16:59.867 --> 17:02.581
Well, we have to report it.
If it's nothing, it'll get dropped.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.290
- But the wife said he never hit her.
- The police will sort it out.

17:05.308 --> 17:07.000
- Hey, hey.
- What? What?

17:07.015 --> 17:08.271
What? She's got a bruised face.

17:08.338 --> 17:10.781
So, you want to put him in a locked
facility with a bunch of criminals?

17:10.797 --> 17:13.622
You heard him. He won't get
any help unless he's forced to.

17:13.627 --> 17:15.170
It's time someone scared
some sense into him.

17:15.185 --> 17:16.800
You might be right about this, but I...

17:16.807 --> 17:20.520
Look, let's try this. You be the resident,
I'll be the attending, okay?

17:24.088 --> 17:25.452
Okay.

17:26.307 --> 17:28.632
Can I help you find something, Dr. Pratt?

17:28.657 --> 17:29.843
What? No.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.112
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah--
are we out of diuretics?

17:32.216 --> 17:36.923
Uh, I think there are
some samples over here, but...

17:37.585 --> 17:39.442
The free sample closet.

17:39.775 --> 17:41.622
Hope, you genius.

17:42.676 --> 17:44.240
I thought, uh...

17:45.327 --> 17:48.381
- Aren't you not working this shift?
- Yeah, that's right.

17:50.007 --> 17:51.991
Well, then, why are you...

17:52.006 --> 17:55.842
I'm running a little low on some stuff
for some people I'm helping out at church.

17:56.575 --> 17:59.531
Church? I didn't know that
you volunteered at church.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.131
Nah, this is not going to be enough.
Do we have anything anywhere else?

18:02.638 --> 18:05.141
- Come on.
- There was a drug rep here earlier.

18:05.157 --> 18:07.103
- Maybe they restocked?
- Drug rep?

18:07.127 --> 18:11.210
She even brought pizza.
Very sweet girl from Dayton, Ohio.

18:11.227 --> 18:14.392
My family's originally from Akron,
so we had a lot in common.

18:14.408 --> 18:18.342
I think her name was... Dora.

18:18.905 --> 18:21.053
- Here you go, buddy.
- I'm not hungry.

18:21.065 --> 18:24.001
Well, it might make you feel better,
and this soup is the bomb.

18:24.018 --> 18:25.880
I mean, seriously, we call it
the bomb soup down here.

18:25.898 --> 18:28.043
You eat this soup,
you're going to fart like a cannon.

18:30.386 --> 18:32.543
Ketamine's ready to go
at two migs per kilo per hour

18:32.555 --> 18:35.282
with Ribavirin loading dose
of 33 migs per kilo.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.451
When's Paulie going to wake up?

18:38.966 --> 18:39.953
I don't know.

18:40.305 --> 18:42.892
We're going to make Paulie sleep
for a while, maybe a couple weeks.

18:43.005 --> 18:44.412
Hopefully, his body can heal.

18:44.685 --> 18:46.920
Amantadine needs to be given by mouth.

18:47.465 --> 18:48.550
All right.

18:48.746 --> 18:51.003
Hey, Paulie, can you hear me?

18:51.368 --> 18:53.631
I need you to take a little
sip of water here.

18:56.618 --> 18:58.340
The rabies are making it hard
for him to swallow.

18:58.355 --> 19:00.692
-Drop an NG.
- That's not why.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.583
It's because Bloody Mary saw his face.

19:04.575 --> 19:06.332
I'm going to put a tube down his throat
to help him breathe.

19:06.348 --> 19:09.663
- Ten of SUX, 20 of etomidate.
- Pulse ox is only 82.

19:09.746 --> 19:10.700
Ambu bag.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.040
Yankauer with suction on high.

19:14.515 --> 19:16.012
Okay, let's move that.

19:19.006 --> 19:20.131
Teller.

19:20.645 --> 19:21.840
Teller!

20:37.108 --> 20:39.882
Neela, what do you know about
the placement of the hernia mesh?

20:39.898 --> 20:42.400
Must be parallel to the peritoneal sac.

20:42.706 --> 20:43.750
And?

20:44.277 --> 20:46.341
Laterally, the mesh covers
the abdominal wall,

20:46.357 --> 20:49.903
reflects on the iliopubic tract, and
covers several centimeters of the psoas.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.191
Excellent.

20:54.706 --> 20:57.250
Paulie can't breathe!
You have to come help!

20:57.657 --> 20:59.921
- Who the hell is that?
- You can't be in here, Teller.

20:59.938 --> 21:02.491
You have to come help.
Paulie can't breathe!

21:03.148 --> 21:05.503
Go back downstairs.
I can't come with you.

21:05.517 --> 21:08.583
You have to.
You're the Blue Lady.

21:09.538 --> 21:10.602
Please?

21:10.617 --> 21:13.651
Please, just help Paulie.
You need to wake him up.

21:13.997 --> 21:16.482
I can't, Paulie's very sick.

21:16.518 --> 21:17.882
But I saw you.

21:18.907 --> 21:23.741
That other girl, she was asleep
and... you woke her up.

21:23.755 --> 21:26.803
- You brought her back to life.
- That was different.

21:26.898 --> 21:28.423
You can't say no.

21:29.238 --> 21:30.851
You can't!

21:31.307 --> 21:33.130
I know your secret name.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.053
Mayday.

21:40.076 --> 21:41.593
And one day...

21:45.506 --> 21:48.931
One day, every day
is going to be Sunday.

21:49.138 --> 21:52.632
Diuretics, calcium channel blockers,
oral hypoglycemics.

21:52.646 --> 21:58.723
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, proton
pump inhibitors, beta-agonist inhalers.

21:59.175 --> 22:01.441
Enough meds for 90% of your people.

22:03.037 --> 22:04.761
It was fast work.

22:05.007 --> 22:07.921
- How'd you manage it?
- I sold my soul to a drug company.

22:08.356 --> 22:10.663
Well, not exactly my soul.
Give me those.

22:10.675 --> 22:12.892
I'll go lock them up in the closet.

22:13.548 --> 22:16.432
Uh, Greg's told me about
what you're doing here.

22:16.448 --> 22:21.373
I'd love to be a part of it. That's why
I took my break time to help out Dr. Pratt.

22:21.858 --> 22:27.733
- Uh... are you a med student?
- Hope Bobek. I'm an intern.

22:27.757 --> 22:31.510
It's the same thing as a first year
resident, but they call us interns.

22:31.528 --> 22:33.623
I don't really know why.

22:34.965 --> 22:38.933
- I love old churches like this.
- Do you?

22:38.947 --> 22:40.992
It's so big.

22:41.288 --> 22:43.052
Yes, it is, isn't it?

22:43.636 --> 22:48.293
It's estimated that between ten and 20%
of youth in this country are obese.

22:48.305 --> 22:51.591
A condition which leads
to increased risk of diabetes,

22:51.608 --> 22:55.623
- heart disease, high cholesterol...
- Lucy's choking! Somebody help !

22:58.897 --> 23:01.710
Sweetie, honey, can you breathe?

23:01.727 --> 23:04.183
Can you speak?
Okay, here we go.

23:06.407 --> 23:08.123
All right.
I need some help here.

23:08.135 --> 23:10.013
- Look out.
- Kerry, what's happening?

23:10.025 --> 23:12.873
Probably has a piece of food
obstructing her trachea.

23:12.898 --> 23:14.833
Hang in there, Lucy.
Here we go.

23:19.868 --> 23:23.713
Okay, get me a... kitchen knife with
a sharp point and a drinking straw.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.970
Now, go.

23:25.456 --> 23:27.901
This is going to hurt for a second.

23:28.488 --> 23:32.490
Ready?
One, two, three...

23:34.565 --> 23:37.353
Oh, she's cutting her throat.

23:38.866 --> 23:40.472
- He's still sleeping?
- Yes.

23:40.495 --> 23:44.280
He's got peripheral IV's for continuous
sedation and anti-viral therapy.

23:44.295 --> 23:47.002
He needs a central line if he's gonna
do blood products and,

23:47.036 --> 23:49.293
- uh... clotting factors.
- Central line is too risky with a DIC.

23:49.306 --> 23:51.101
- He could bleed out.
- Well, we gotta do something.

23:51.115 --> 23:53.983
- What about a saphenous cutdown?
- Lily, betadine.

23:55.535 --> 23:58.350
Thanks for getting down here so fast.
I thought we were gonna lose him.

23:58.636 --> 24:00.403
- She had to come.
- Ten blade.

24:00.416 --> 24:01.730
Curved hemostat.

24:01.846 --> 24:04.060
- He says I'm the Blue Lady.
- Ahh.

24:04.105 --> 24:07.671
When I was a paramedic, we used to run
homeless kids like this once in a while.

24:07.767 --> 24:09.893
- 3-0 silk.
- Survival.

24:10.076 --> 24:12.442
They have to make up a story
about their world.

24:12.727 --> 24:14.182
Helps them get through it.

24:14.195 --> 24:15.810
It's not a story.

24:17.398 --> 24:18.800
It's real.

24:19.828 --> 24:24.341
God took a boat across the lake 'cause
he couldn't fight the demons in Chicago.

24:25.255 --> 24:28.203
There were too many of them
and they're always out to hurt you.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.771
Like Bloody Mary?

24:30.206 --> 24:32.603
Demons turn you into druggies or whores.

24:33.366 --> 24:35.493
One shot my brother from his black SUV.

24:35.506 --> 24:37.972
- Eleven blade.
- What about good spirits?

24:37.975 --> 24:40.800
- Any of those?
- The angels could save you.

24:41.178 --> 24:44.242
They ate the Millennium light
and stop the Hawk from frostbiting.

24:44.277 --> 24:47.683
So the Blue Lady can save you
if you're hurt or sick, huh?

24:48.408 --> 24:49.591
She has to.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.960
If you know her secret name.

24:52.416 --> 24:54.120
Triple lumen catheter.

24:56.706 --> 24:57.812
Teller.

24:58.438 --> 25:00.682
- Look, Ellie.
- I told you not to stay.

25:00.696 --> 25:02.810
I told you you'd get us in trouble.

25:03.175 --> 25:04.340
It's okay.

25:06.487 --> 25:08.241
She's gonna fix Paulie.

25:09.316 --> 25:10.573
Are you leaving?

25:11.247 --> 25:14.003
I've tried to make him get help.
He won't listen to me.

25:14.368 --> 25:18.070
I've lost a son and now it looks like
I'm gonna lose a husband, too.

25:18.365 --> 25:21.082
Well, not if you don't want to.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.711
How bad does it have to get before
he realizes that there's a problem?

25:25.806 --> 25:27.850
Does he have to doze off
with a cigarette in his hand

25:27.868 --> 25:30.231
and burn the place down
or fall through a glass door?

25:30.245 --> 25:34.400
Well, alcoholism's a disease.
I mean, maybe the two of us

25:34.417 --> 25:36.901
together can convince him
to get some treatment.

25:40.156 --> 25:43.393
I love him.
I really do.

25:43.408 --> 25:45.601
And he's a good man.

25:46.945 --> 25:51.452
He just... can't seem to get over this.

25:53.287 --> 25:57.000
I think he's starting to understand
that he needs to make some changes.

26:10.918 --> 26:15.680
Hemmerdinger's been DC'd, Winston
is in radiology and Barnaby died.

26:15.696 --> 26:17.873
- Now, listen, about the Hadleys...
- Abby...

26:17.998 --> 26:20.401
Look, they love each other.
They're struggling right now.

26:20.425 --> 26:22.721
- You're defending spousal abuse.
- I don't think that's what happened.

26:22.726 --> 26:25.820
- The guy's an alcoholic.
- Yeah, well, so am I.

26:28.308 --> 26:30.861
I already reported it.
The cops are on their way.

26:35.316 --> 26:38.573
Lucy Mothley criked for upper
airway obstruction.

26:38.678 --> 26:39.760
What happened?

26:39.778 --> 26:44.351
I was doing a stand-up in a middle school
lunch room and she started choking.

27:09.476 --> 27:11.443
I know you probably think that...

27:12.475 --> 27:14.812
I wanted to move in here because of this.

27:14.978 --> 27:17.881
You told me that you wanted
to be closer to school.

27:17.896 --> 27:21.770
I did, and I thought maybe we could be
brothers like we talked about last year.

27:21.847 --> 27:24.540
Oh. Oh.
So you, uh...

27:24.778 --> 27:28.650
just didn't need a little bit more privacy
than living with the family could get you, huh?

27:29.958 --> 27:31.630
It's not like that.

27:32.285 --> 27:34.862
You lied to me,
and I'm not cool with that.

27:35.788 --> 27:38.320
- I didn't lie.
- I'm not cool with it.

27:38.977 --> 27:40.452
So what, Greg?

27:41.665 --> 27:43.503
What, if I hadda told you the truth?

27:44.908 --> 27:46.632
Then you would have been cool with it?

27:50.965 --> 27:52.951
You think this is easy for me?

27:55.578 --> 27:57.452
It's not like this has been
going on a long time.

27:57.457 --> 27:59.580
It's just, just something that happened.

28:05.326 --> 28:07.810
I don't know, man.
It's like a phase or something.

29:28.247 --> 29:30.653
- He's bradying down.
- Mig of atropine.

29:30.775 --> 29:33.423
- Where you been?
- I was helping Dr. Pratt with something. Sorry

29:33.438 --> 29:35.461
Lost the pulse.
Starting compressions.

29:35.477 --> 29:36.693
I can do that.

29:36.716 --> 29:38.742
- Call Kovac.
- Amp of epi.

29:39.146 --> 29:41.563
It's hard to bag.
There's a lot of resistance.

29:41.638 --> 29:42.873
What's the rhythm?

29:43.316 --> 29:46.092
He's absent breath sounds on the left.

29:46.177 --> 29:49.800
Could have had a small pneumo that
converted to tension with intubation.

29:52.407 --> 29:55.332
- There's still no pulse.
- Looks like V-fib. Charge of 360.

29:55.345 --> 29:58.762
The rabies can damage
the conduction system of the heart.

29:58.806 --> 30:00.443
- Charged.
- Clear!

30:00.828 --> 30:03.691
- No change.
- The virus is too advanced.

30:04.057 --> 30:05.372
Hundred of Lidocaine.

30:05.998 --> 30:08.020
I don't think he's going to make it.

30:09.028 --> 30:11.342
- Hundred of Lidocaine.
- Paulie.

30:12.176 --> 30:13.512
Teller!

30:14.308 --> 30:15.531
Clear.

30:16.707 --> 30:19.481
Hey, wait!
Come on, let's go!

30:19.495 --> 30:22.443
Stop it! Please!
Let us help you!

30:22.455 --> 30:25.792
You both need medicine so
you don't get sick like Paulie!

30:25.807 --> 30:27.502
I thought you were going to save him!

30:27.517 --> 30:30.322
It's not her, Teller.
She's just a doctor.

30:30.335 --> 30:31.901
Tell him you're not the Blue Lady.

30:31.917 --> 30:34.223
Please!
You could have what Paulie has!

30:34.257 --> 30:35.392
Please!

31:15.026 --> 31:18.081
Neela!
We need you inside!

31:18.715 --> 31:20.242
We got him back!

31:20.248 --> 31:22.123
- What?
- The rabies kid.

31:22.135 --> 31:25.123
- He's got a rhythm, a pulse and a BP.
- That's not possible.

31:25.136 --> 31:28.663
Tony put the pulse ox on his finger
and the kid grabbed his hand.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.581
It's, it's like a miracle!
Come on!

31:35.048 --> 31:36.922
Hey. You're still here.

31:36.927 --> 31:39.293
Oh, I wanted to make sure
that she was okay,

31:39.307 --> 31:42.321
and I got permission from her parents
to air what happened.

31:42.337 --> 31:44.583
- Why?
- Are you kidding me?

31:44.597 --> 31:48.200
If a male doctor pulled that off on TV,
he'd have his own syndication deal.

31:48.218 --> 31:50.643
- Yeah, well.
- No, seriously, Kerry.

31:50.657 --> 31:53.193
That was, that was pretty incredible.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.251
I'm, I'm still buzzing.

31:55.437 --> 31:57.643
How do you come down
from something like that?

31:57.656 --> 32:01.353
Uh... a glass of wine and a hot
bath at the end of the day help.

32:01.367 --> 32:03.512
Mmm. Sounds good to me.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.331
All right.

32:07.447 --> 32:11.431
- Ketamine is at two per kilo per hour.
- He's got spontaneous eye-opening.

32:11.448 --> 32:13.311
That's a good sign,
but we need to deepen his coma.

32:13.326 --> 32:16.263
Let's double up on the midazolam
drip and I'll check back later.

32:17.375 --> 32:18.991
Boy, he's got goosebumps.

32:19.008 --> 32:21.210
I'll go get a warming blanket.

32:23.537 --> 32:25.050
He's putting up a fight.

32:25.665 --> 32:27.412
He still has a long way to go.

32:27.628 --> 32:30.341
Hope's right.
It's a miracle he's alive.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.592
Maybe you are the Blue Lady after all.

32:34.005 --> 32:37.432
I mean, if I was those kids,
I'd sure as hell want to believe that.

32:38.695 --> 32:40.762
If you believe in something hard enough...

32:43.027 --> 32:44.170
What?

32:44.776 --> 32:48.051
Well... I've talked myself into...

32:48.406 --> 32:50.770
things that weren't true
plenty of times.

32:51.858 --> 32:53.482
What sort of things?

32:54.308 --> 32:55.933
I don't know. Like, uh...

32:56.875 --> 32:59.940
stuff about myself, my job,

33:00.575 --> 33:02.211
people in my life.

33:04.716 --> 33:07.200
Everything seems to be
a lot clearer now, though.

33:10.608 --> 33:11.940
I have something to do.

33:11.976 --> 33:13.870
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah, okay.

33:18.138 --> 33:21.233
Hey. You never told me
what your secret name was.

33:22.507 --> 33:24.500
You're the one that gave it to me.

33:25.246 --> 33:26.443
Mayday?

33:26.477 --> 33:29.502
Well, Teller must have overheard you.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.501
You never told me what it means.

33:39.178 --> 33:43.102
She doesn't want to press charges,
but the fact is he hit her.

33:43.558 --> 33:45.173
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Just a minute.

33:45.185 --> 33:47.123
That's... still need to get
a statement from the wife.

33:47.137 --> 33:49.600
- That's fine.
- I'm going to Ike's to get some dinner.

33:49.617 --> 33:51.632
Okay. I'll pick you up there.

33:52.107 --> 33:54.283
Uh, listen, before you do that,

33:54.296 --> 33:57.913
there's something else
I need to ask you, in private.

34:01.185 --> 34:02.533
You okay, doc?

34:07.695 --> 34:08.663
What is it?

34:09.538 --> 34:12.012
It belongs to my son.
It was sent to me here.

34:12.947 --> 34:15.882
See the initials?
C.A.-- Curtis Ames.

34:15.887 --> 34:17.581
He was a patient of mine.

34:17.945 --> 34:20.751
I think he's trying to threaten us.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.871
Maybe he just wanted to return it.

34:23.888 --> 34:27.452
Look, he followed my wife
and child to the park.

34:28.197 --> 34:30.331
I'd like you to go talk to him.

34:32.196 --> 34:34.992
Help me protect my family.

34:36.025 --> 34:37.031
Okay.

34:37.376 --> 34:41.242
Okay, well, give him four more ounces,
and I'll be back in a half hour.

34:41.947 --> 34:43.172
All right, bye.

34:47.648 --> 34:48.983
Cell phones.

34:49.348 --> 34:51.360
How'd we ever survive without them?

34:51.378 --> 34:54.783
Sorry.
That was my baby-sitter.

34:56.208 --> 34:58.550
Aren't you a little old
to need a baby-sitter?

34:59.425 --> 35:01.390
- It was for my baby.
- Oh.

35:02.577 --> 35:05.541
Well, aren't you a little young
to have one of those?

35:05.987 --> 35:08.040
- Can I buy you a beer?
- No, thanks.

35:08.076 --> 35:09.701
I never touch the stuff.

35:10.965 --> 35:15.063
So... boy or girl?

35:15.447 --> 35:16.581
Boy.

35:16.695 --> 35:18.293
Uh, six months.

35:23.006 --> 35:24.243
Do you have kids?

35:24.755 --> 35:26.710
- Five.
- Five?

35:27.778 --> 35:32.823
Yep, a boy and girl of my own
and three stepdaughters.

35:35.097 --> 35:37.291
- Do you live in Chicago?
- Texas.

35:37.398 --> 35:38.583
- Texas?
- Yep.

35:38.595 --> 35:40.322
- You're a long way from home.
- Yep.

35:40.336 --> 35:41.731
What are you doing here?

35:43.807 --> 35:47.202
Well, I came up to see
an old buddy of mine.

35:47.665 --> 35:49.223
In the hospital.

35:49.948 --> 35:55.273
But I walked into the lobby,
I looked around, chickened out.

35:56.825 --> 35:57.762
Why?

35:59.418 --> 36:03.672
Well, you know, you know, I buried
a few friends over the last couple of years.

36:04.017 --> 36:07.763
- And hospitals make me queasy.
- Yeah. Well, me, too.

36:08.156 --> 36:09.933
And I work in one.

36:10.557 --> 36:12.173
You're a nurse, huh?

36:14.165 --> 36:16.781
I used to be a nurse,
but now I'm a doctor.

36:18.416 --> 36:19.960
- Really?
- Yeah.

36:21.516 --> 36:23.740
- What's so funny?
- Ah, nothing.

36:23.866 --> 36:25.772
Why are you laughing?

36:26.555 --> 36:28.150
It's just, uh...

36:29.866 --> 36:34.471
Well, the only doctors I ever met
were white-haired old guys

36:34.486 --> 36:36.903
with glasses and necks like turkeys.

36:37.105 --> 36:39.660
Well, I guess I've got that
to look forward to.

36:42.545 --> 36:44.891
- What do you do in Texas?
- Oil.

36:45.747 --> 36:46.853
Tycoon?

36:47.636 --> 36:52.080
Don't I wish.
No, I work the rigs-- machinist.

36:52.435 --> 36:54.183
Ever seen an oil fire?

36:54.548 --> 36:57.360
Seen one?
Hell, I started one.

37:00.175 --> 37:01.872
Can we have our chips, please?

37:03.225 --> 37:06.001
What are you gonna eat in the movie?
That's why we got licorice.

37:06.066 --> 37:08.083
Think fast, Horndog.
Think fast.

37:08.898 --> 37:10.670
- Good hands.
- Thanks.

37:11.826 --> 37:14.201
- What do you think of this kid?
- Seems okay.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.300
Kind of polite, quiet.

37:17.486 --> 37:19.960
Yeah, all the common traits
of a serial killer.

37:20.377 --> 37:23.220
I can't believe she's gonna
be dating soon.

37:27.465 --> 37:29.591
Listen, Meg, there's been
something on my mind.

37:29.607 --> 37:30.991
Yeah, me, too.

37:31.488 --> 37:32.613
Really?

37:32.735 --> 37:35.820
Yeah, I've been thinking
about moving forward.

37:37.526 --> 37:40.093
I think Sarah's old enough
to accept it now.

37:42.028 --> 37:43.973
In fact, I think it would make her happy.

37:44.006 --> 37:45.082
What would?

37:45.747 --> 37:47.402
Us making this permanent.

37:48.975 --> 37:51.383
- We've danced around it long enough.
- No, no, no, no.

37:51.397 --> 37:52.811
That's not what I meant.

37:53.507 --> 37:55.681
Meg, I can't do this anymore.

37:57.265 --> 38:00.232
Us living together,
but not really living together.

38:00.995 --> 38:03.551
Sleeping with each other when we need to.

38:03.675 --> 38:07.381
It's too easy, it's like a placeholder.

38:08.125 --> 38:10.903
I think it's stopping us
from getting on with our lives.

38:11.277 --> 38:13.802
What are you talking about?
This is our lives.

38:16.137 --> 38:17.552
I don't want it to be.

38:19.618 --> 38:21.650
We fell into this, Meg.

38:22.006 --> 38:24.591
I care about you and Sarah,
but I have to do my own thing.

38:24.608 --> 38:26.120
What's her name?

38:27.337 --> 38:28.710
Come on, Meg.

38:29.255 --> 38:31.462
What?
So you want to screw some other girl,

38:31.477 --> 38:34.170
it won't be the first time.
They never last.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.643
It's more than that.

38:40.296 --> 38:44.380
You think you can keep what
you want, and leave the rest?

38:45.518 --> 38:47.640
Be part of our lives, but not commit?

38:47.675 --> 38:50.513
- It doesn't work that way, Tony.
- I've committed fully for a long time,

38:50.528 --> 38:51.963
Meg, and you know that.

38:53.505 --> 38:57.552
We love you... and you love us.

39:01.488 --> 39:03.550
I know you don't want to blow that.

39:37.205 --> 39:40.570
You know, Chicago winters can
be pretty tough on asthma.

39:40.877 --> 39:43.673
- You should get a flu shot.
- Nah, I hate needles.

39:43.686 --> 39:47.302
Just come by the E.R., I'll do it
myself. I promise I'll be gentle.

39:49.715 --> 39:51.043
Luka, this is...?

39:51.385 --> 39:52.692
- Eddie.
- Eddie.

39:53.048 --> 39:56.140
- You the husband?
- We're not married.

39:56.935 --> 39:58.000
Gotcha.

39:58.017 --> 39:59.543
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

40:00.115 --> 40:05.220
Well, Eddie, it was nice to meet you.
And remember, flu shot.

40:05.246 --> 40:08.501
Thanks for the advice and the company.

40:08.635 --> 40:11.063
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

40:28.015 --> 40:30.441
Do you want to talk
about what's bugging you?

40:31.655 --> 40:34.920
No, you don't want to talk about it,
or no, nothing's bugging you?

40:34.948 --> 40:36.713
Something was,
but I took care of it now.

40:36.725 --> 40:38.503
Nothing to worry about.

40:39.865 --> 40:41.141
Okay.

41:08.525 --> 41:09.932
Dr. Rasgotra?

41:10.217 --> 41:12.191
I'm sorry.
I must have nodded off.

41:13.076 --> 41:15.441
You've been working a lot, huh?

41:15.456 --> 41:18.192
It's coming up to 30 hours now.

41:18.218 --> 41:20.382
Do you want me to get you something?

41:20.395 --> 41:23.133
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

41:25.435 --> 41:26.791
How is he?

41:28.457 --> 41:31.171
He needs to be in a coma for two weeks,

41:32.027 --> 41:37.160
until increased levels of rabies antibodies
appear in his cerebrospinal fluid.

41:38.886 --> 41:44.101
And then we'll wean him off sedation,
see if any neurologic function returns.

41:45.868 --> 41:49.730
I prayed for him at church today.

41:51.995 --> 41:57.552
I heard that his friends have a whole
story about demons and spirits.

42:00.135 --> 42:02.612
Who are we to judge, right?

42:03.278 --> 42:06.110
Everybody needs something to believe in.

42:09.467 --> 42:12.842
I will see you tomorrow, Dr. Rasgotra.

42:13.096 --> 42:14.761
Good night, Hope.

42:37.285 --> 42:42.372
