00:02.350 --> 00:04.387
Previously on
"Life Sentence"...

00:04.430 --> 00:05.773
Stella: For the last eight years,
I've been living with cancer.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.480
I tried to live my life
to the fullest.

00:07.520 --> 00:10.080
I even went to Paris
and married a guy I just met.

00:10.140 --> 00:11.528
After all, I am dying.

00:11.570 --> 00:12.526
You're not dying.

00:12.570 --> 00:15.005
Dr. Chang said that
I'm cured.

00:15.050 --> 00:16.393
But you don't have
kids yet, Stella.

00:16.450 --> 00:18.669
Nobody would blame you
if you decided that

00:18.710 --> 00:21.224
you weren't ready
for a life-long commitment.

00:21.280 --> 00:22.497
Why are you here?

00:22.540 --> 00:24.315
When I was sick,
this was my room.

00:24.370 --> 00:26.498
So the woman he shared
a one-bedroom flat with

00:26.540 --> 00:29.498
in London for two years,
Pippa Hollingsworth.

00:29.550 --> 00:30.972
You did know about her,
didn't you?

00:31.030 --> 00:32.191
Pippa?

00:32.240 --> 00:33.503
Who's Pippa, Wes?

00:33.550 --> 00:35.325
You made me feel
like such an idiot.

00:35.380 --> 00:38.725
This whole divorce thing's
turning out to be a real drag.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.078
Going through one myself.

00:41.860 --> 00:44.249
Lauren?
Aiden?

00:44.300 --> 00:47.258
I live here
with my father,

00:47.300 --> 00:50.179
whose room
you just came out of,

00:50.220 --> 00:52.860
Have you seen my new oncologist?
He's so hot.

00:52.920 --> 00:53.955
Dr. William Grant.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.341
Stella Abbott,
volunteer.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.822
How long have you been married?Six months.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.394
It's a shame I didn't meet you
seven months ago.

01:00.450 --> 01:05.536
Bah-da-da-da, da

01:05.580 --> 01:08.845
Don't be that way

01:08.890 --> 01:12.542
The last few weeks, my life
had been moving so fast.

01:12.590 --> 01:13.671
I wanted to slow it down.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.451
I just wish you could feel

01:16.510 --> 01:18.729
Normally, my husband would
be in here with me,

01:18.770 --> 01:22.502
but it just didn't seem like our schedules lined up anymore.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.905
Show, never tell

01:25.950 --> 01:28.078
But I know you too well

01:28.130 --> 01:31.122
He was up late every night,
talking with clients,

01:31.170 --> 01:33.127
instead of coming to bed
with me.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.830
Was a promise

01:34.870 --> 01:39.080
Would you break it,
if you're honest

01:39.140 --> 01:41.222
Tell the mirror

01:41.270 --> 01:43.090
When I woke up to go to work,

01:43.140 --> 01:45.529
he was just heading to sleep.

01:48.060 --> 01:54.716
I don't wanna be you We weren't connecting.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.979
Anymore

01:57.020 --> 01:59.933
There you go.

01:59.980 --> 02:01.152
Clean up
on table four.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.759
Someone had
an oatmeal problem.

02:02.810 --> 02:04.676
What is an "oatmeal prob--

02:04.730 --> 02:06.334
Oh, my God.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.030
Are we sure
that that's oatmeal?

02:08.080 --> 02:09.161
Either way,
it's a problem.

02:16.310 --> 02:18.119
Oh, my G--I'm sorry.
I didn't m--

02:18.180 --> 02:19.955
Hey.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.173
I-I-I didn't know that you --I was just, uh...

02:22.220 --> 02:24.177
taking a detour
on my way to the hospital.

02:24.230 --> 02:26.130
Is now a bad time Yes. No.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.488
What
What's up?

02:27.530 --> 02:29.055
I just spoke to a colleague
from Stanford,

02:29.100 --> 02:31.569
and it turns out that
there's a new chemo trial

02:31.620 --> 02:34.237
coming up that your friend Sadie
may be eligible for.

02:34.280 --> 02:35.497
Wow. That's amazing.

02:35.540 --> 02:36.974
I thought we could
tell her together.

02:37.020 --> 02:40.149
I'll furnish the facts.
You can keep me human.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.497
I -- Uh...

02:41.550 --> 02:43.450
I don't think that
I can make it to the hospital.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.286
Stella, can I ask you
one question? Hmm?

02:46.340 --> 02:47.808
When I made that remark,
you know,

02:47.860 --> 02:50.113
about wishing that I'd met you
seven months ago,

02:50.170 --> 02:52.639
did I cross a line there?
Because all I meant was --

02:52.690 --> 02:56.126
No. No. No, no.
No crossing. No lines.

02:56.170 --> 02:57.217
You shouldn't think twice
about it,

02:57.260 --> 02:58.477
"cause I sure haven't.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.956
Cool. Uh, I have
one last question.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.479
Can I get a scone to go?

03:03.530 --> 03:05.658
-Oh, sure.
-Thanks.

03:07.700 --> 03:10.749
So you've got
a work

03:10.790 --> 03:11.746
Greedy much?

03:11.800 --> 03:14.269
No, that is a doctor...
friend.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.834
And we have a patient
in common.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.234
I can't believe
you've got two studs,

03:19.280 --> 03:20.975
and I'm sleeping
with my pug.

03:21.020 --> 03:22.670
Please go away.
Chill, dude.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.065
It's okay to have chemistry
with more than one person.

03:26.110 --> 03:27.896
One is enough for me.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.544
Okay, but if you decide

03:29.600 --> 03:30.761
to trade out
the old model,

03:30.810 --> 03:33.074
can I test-drive
Bachelor Number One?

03:33.120 --> 03:36.294
No, he's mine,
and I am not giving him up.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.384
Hey. Psst.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.694
Wes, can you hear me?
Are you sleeping?

03:42.740 --> 03:45.653
I can't fix the dishwasher.Are you working this weekend?

03:45.700 --> 03:47.395
No. Why?

03:47.440 --> 03:48.748
We're going to Paris.

03:52.310 --> 03:54.358
Don't worry about a thing

03:54.400 --> 03:58.052
You'll learn to live again

03:58.100 --> 04:00.239
You're gonna learn
to live again

04:00.280 --> 04:04.490
Oh, oh, oh

04:06.280 --> 04:07.361
How are we doing this?

04:07.420 --> 04:08.842
Doing what?

04:08.900 --> 04:10.550
Um...flying to France

04:10.590 --> 04:13.764
when we have $37
in our savings account.

04:13.810 --> 04:16.029
We are bringing
Paris here.

04:16.079 --> 04:17.764
We'll draw a bubble
around the weekend,

04:17.820 --> 04:18.810
and we'll stay home,

04:18.860 --> 04:20.259
and we'll cook
that incredible meal

04:20.300 --> 04:21.552
we had the last night
at the St. Germain.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.079
Stells,
can I just wake up?

04:23.130 --> 04:25.770
And we will watch these
sexy French movies.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.696
We'll only take breaks
to make love and eat cheese.

04:27.740 --> 04:28.992
We will turn off
our phones.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.700
We will stay naked all day
and drink good wine.

04:30.740 --> 04:32.617
And I found that recipe
for that beef bourguignon.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.173
The restaurant's website
said that the secret

04:34.230 --> 04:35.356
is to cook it
the night before.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.266
Babe...

04:37.320 --> 04:40.574
We need to get back to a place
where it was just the two of us.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.884
No distractions,
no noise --

04:42.930 --> 04:47.584
just you, me,
and stinky cheese.

04:47.630 --> 04:49.143
Please say "yes."

04:49.200 --> 04:51.009
Please.

04:51.070 --> 04:52.287
Oui.

04:55.860 --> 04:59.683
How do we not have coffee?
Or eggs

04:59.730 --> 05:01.334
I'm good with just bed
and no breakfast.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.814
No, no, I want to
make you something.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.555
You stay here.
I'll be right back.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.125
But you have class.
Only one.

05:06.170 --> 05:07.342
Not till noon.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.949
Will you be okay here
without me?

05:09.000 --> 05:10.820
Hm.

05:12.310 --> 05:13.436
Oh! Sorry.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.346
Lauren,
you remember my son.

05:15.400 --> 05:16.959
How's it going?

05:17.010 --> 05:19.524
I was just running out to get
some stuff for breakfast.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.968
Would you like to join us?No, I'm good.

05:21.010 --> 05:22.967
I had a bowl of cereal
at Diego's and a waffle.

05:23.010 --> 05:25.149
Maybe it was an English muffin.
I found it under the couch.

05:25.190 --> 05:27.659
Lint is not a food group.
I'll get enough for three.

05:27.710 --> 05:29.974
Okay. All right, I'll see ya.

05:34.810 --> 05:36.460
I still haven't told him
about us.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.285
About...our history.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.025
W-- Don't.
There's no reason to.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.469
Yeah, but I feel like
the longer I wait,

05:41.510 --> 05:42.818
the worse it's gonna get.

05:42.860 --> 05:45.033
And if I just rip
the band-aid off now...

05:45.080 --> 05:46.468
Don't rip off anything.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.249
He and I are finally
in a good place.

05:48.300 --> 05:50.553
You crush him, and it'll set him
back to last week.

05:50.610 --> 05:51.645
What was last week?

05:51.690 --> 05:53.385
He was living
in a bathrobe,

05:53.440 --> 05:56.307
combing his hair
with a towel.

05:56.350 --> 05:57.863
He needs this.

05:57.920 --> 06:00.434
Lauren, it's not like you
and I -- We weren't --

06:00.490 --> 06:02.356
It was one crazy,
frisky night.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.652
You're right.

06:03.710 --> 06:05.360
It really wasn't all that
memorable, was it?

06:05.400 --> 06:06.538
It was frisky.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.480
Aiden, I really
like your dad.

06:08.540 --> 06:11.009
Me, too. Go for it.
Let him live in the moment.

06:11.060 --> 06:12.403
No, what I'm trying
to say is,

06:12.450 --> 06:15.192
I think it might be more
than a moment.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.583
Seriously?

06:16.630 --> 06:18.359
Lauren,
this is my father.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.672
He eats fruit
and wears slippers.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.415
He quotes
Benjamin Franklin.

06:21.460 --> 06:24.418
He chokes up listening
to The Carpenters.

06:24.470 --> 06:25.722
I love that.

06:25.770 --> 06:28.683
And he's just
so...bright.

06:28.730 --> 06:30.073
I...

06:30.120 --> 06:32.555
He's definitely not gonna
want to know about us.

06:35.130 --> 06:36.427
You're absolutely right.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.778
I won't say anything
if you won't say anything.

06:38.830 --> 06:39.820
Deal.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.358
Bonjour.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.960
Dr. Grant left this
for you.

06:49.100 --> 06:50.704
William: You know, I used to
have really nice handwriting,

06:50.750 --> 06:54.015
but they throw you out
of med school for that.

06:54.060 --> 06:55.016
What's this?

06:55.060 --> 06:56.710
It's an invite
to a fundraiser.

06:56.760 --> 06:58.580
The guy leading the trial
that I mentioned yesterday

06:58.630 --> 07:00.496
is the keynote speaker,
so I bought two tickets,

07:00.550 --> 07:02.621
and I thought maybe
you want to join me.

07:02.680 --> 07:05.547
Y-You know I'm married,
right?

07:05.590 --> 07:07.024
This is not a date,
Stella.

07:07.070 --> 07:08.856
This is 300 people
with checkbooks

07:08.900 --> 07:10.982
and, maybe,
some rubbery chicken.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.510
I just thought that if you got
to meet Dr. Freedman in person,

07:13.560 --> 07:14.777
you might be able
to put a charming face

07:14.820 --> 07:16.515
on Sadie's situation.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.551
I would love to help.
When is this?

07:18.610 --> 07:19.691
Tomorrow night,
actually.

07:19.740 --> 07:20.901
Sorry.
I know it's last minute.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.564
I can't.
I'm in a bubble.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.521
Excuse me? I just
mean, my husband and I --

07:24.570 --> 07:27.130
We're doing this whole
Paris thing-y all weekend,

07:27.180 --> 07:28.568
Okay

07:28.620 --> 07:30.440
Um, I can see if I can get
three tickets, you know?

07:30.490 --> 07:31.742
Dr. Grant?

07:31.790 --> 07:33.269
They're still waiting on you
in Radiology.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.574
Thank you, Donna.
All right, I'll see ya.

07:36.630 --> 07:38.234
I can't go!

07:39.630 --> 07:40.791
I can't go.

07:44.980 --> 07:47.506
Don't scrape
the entry wall.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.279
The official closing
is tomorrow.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.503
I thought they bought all
of our furniture.

07:51.550 --> 07:52.813
I'm not giving them
everything.

07:52.860 --> 07:54.760
This is an antique.Why is it so damn heavy?

07:54.820 --> 07:57.460
It's Louis Quatorze.Is he still in it?

07:57.520 --> 07:59.033
No. Okay, okay.
Just stop.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.639
Put it down gently.

08:00.690 --> 08:02.476
I'm gonna ask your father
for help.

08:04.740 --> 08:07.698
-Allow me.
-Thank you. Such a gentleman.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.302
Who is that
with your father?

08:12.360 --> 08:14.658
Who is that woman?

08:14.710 --> 08:17.611
I think she's delivering
something.

08:17.670 --> 08:18.876
He's kissing her.

08:18.930 --> 08:21.058
He's always been
a good tipper.

08:21.100 --> 08:24.582
What if we flipped
King Louie over

08:24.630 --> 08:26.018
and dragged him?

08:26.070 --> 08:28.141
Aiden, you don't have
to protect my feelings.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.544
I'm happy to see
your father moving on.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.548
I have,
so why shouldn't he?

08:37.030 --> 08:39.852
I had all the ingredients for a perfect night in Paris --

08:39.909 --> 08:41.639
a fresh baguette,
stinky cheese,

08:41.690 --> 08:44.478
and an outfit that was
definitely not safe for work.

08:46.700 --> 08:49.089
Nothing could burst our bubble.

08:49.130 --> 08:50.347
Ida: Hi, honey.

08:50.390 --> 08:52.609
Except my mom.

08:52.660 --> 08:54.048
I'm curious.

08:54.090 --> 08:55.876
Have you met this woman
your father's dating?

08:55.920 --> 08:57.740
Your brother said he met her
at a hotel bar.

08:57.790 --> 08:59.440
You don't think
she's a hooker, do you?

08:59.490 --> 09:00.742
What? No.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.006
Why would you even
go there?

09:02.060 --> 09:03.789
Aiden was very squirrelly
when I asked him,

09:03.840 --> 09:05.569
and he wouldn't even
look me in the eye. Mom...

09:05.630 --> 09:07.530
And your father is
very naive.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.673
Two vodka tonics could cost him
a venereal disease.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.586
Does this person
have a name?

09:12.630 --> 09:15.327
I only heard about her
a few days ago.

09:15.380 --> 09:17.633
And Dad seems to be having
a good time with her.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.853
There is nothing fun
about herpes.

09:19.900 --> 09:21.982
Can we just talk about this
later, please?

09:22.030 --> 09:23.555
Oh.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.908
Hey.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.167
Wait.
Where are you going?

09:26.210 --> 09:27.996
I'm gonna take
a shower and crash.

09:28.040 --> 09:30.384
I...have got
a better idea.

09:30.430 --> 09:32.250
[ Sabrina Claudio's
"Orion's Belt" plays ]

09:32.310 --> 09:36.599
This mess of emotions
got his body questioning

09:36.660 --> 09:37.616
Mm.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.048
What's gotten
into you?

09:39.100 --> 09:41.046
Is this feeling all right?

09:44.400 --> 09:45.617
It's my mother.

09:45.670 --> 09:46.614
Why is she calling
my phone?

09:46.670 --> 09:47.967
Well, I hung up on her

09:48.020 --> 09:49.533
when she asked the name
of my dad's hooker.

09:49.580 --> 09:52.231
Your dad has a hooker?0Oh, just shut up and kiss me.

09:54.280 --> 09:55.623
Was she ringing me
from the curb?

09:58.240 --> 10:00.459
Coming!

10:03.120 --> 10:04.633
Oh. Hi.

10:04.690 --> 10:06.112
Um, can I help you?

10:06.170 --> 10:07.945
Sorry. I'm actually --
uh...

10:07.990 --> 10:10.869
I-I was hoping
I might find Wes.

10:10.910 --> 10:12.901
Uh...if --
if he's here.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.122
Yeah, was he
expecting you?

10:15.170 --> 10:16.911
He wasn't.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.951
I-I-I know this must look
positively mental,

10:19.000 --> 10:20.957
me popping in like this,
but I tried ringing.

10:21.010 --> 10:23.138
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

10:24.750 --> 10:26.184
What are you doing here?

10:26.230 --> 10:30.406
Wes...

10:30.450 --> 10:31.190
hi.

10:33.190 --> 10:34.919
Still kinda wondering
who this is.

10:34.980 --> 10:37.756
Stella,
this is Pippa.

10:42.510 --> 10:46.981
And this is how I met
the infamous ex-girlfriend.

10:52.730 --> 10:54.607
Five minutes later,

10:54.650 --> 10:58.120
I was hosting an awkward,
silent tea party.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.742
So, why were you
in San Francisco?

11:08.790 --> 11:11.009
Interviewing for a job.
Long story.

11:11.060 --> 11:13.961
Get to the part where
you decided to come to Oregon.

11:14.020 --> 11:17.103
Well, honestly,
I had this chat with Nigel.

11:17.150 --> 11:20.324
He said you'd been in touch,
and that your wife --

11:20.370 --> 11:21.269
Stella.

11:21.330 --> 11:24.368
Stella had
a miraculous cure.

11:24.420 --> 11:25.581
Wait, who's Nigel?

11:25.640 --> 11:26.710
He's a bloke from
my old office.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.805
Oh.
Go on.

11:27.860 --> 11:29.021
He mentioned
that you sent

11:29.070 --> 11:31.152
somewhat of an odd
text recently.

11:31.210 --> 11:33.770
I suspect he was
concerned about you,

11:33.820 --> 11:36.551
uncertain if your wife --

11:36.600 --> 11:37.908
Stella.

11:37.950 --> 11:41.648
Stella...may have
had a relapse.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.179
No relapse.
Cancer's gone.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.734
I'm jolly good.

11:45.790 --> 11:46.689
Go on. Sorry.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.048
Well, I was so close --

11:48.090 --> 11:50.354
Well, you couldn't have
sent an e

11:50.400 --> 11:52.448
To be honest, I was afraid
you wouldn't answer it.

11:52.490 --> 11:56.051
So I asked Nigel to ask Rupert
if he could get your address.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.659
And when he checked in
with Imogene --

11:57.710 --> 11:59.098
Can we just slow down?

11:59.150 --> 12:01.585
I-I-I've never heard
of any of these people,

12:01.630 --> 12:04.531
and it kind of sounds like we're
taking roll call at Hogwarts.

12:04.590 --> 12:06.069
Tell you what, Pippa.

12:06.110 --> 12:08.716
Why don't you fly back
to Ladbroke Grove

12:08.770 --> 12:11.239
and assure everyone
that I'm splendid?

12:17.340 --> 12:19.775
It's my mom.
I'm supposed to meet her.

12:19.820 --> 12:21.208
I should probably go.

12:21.260 --> 12:24.218
Yeah, it's okay.
I'm a bit knackered.

12:24.260 --> 12:26.308
Not really much
for company.

12:26.350 --> 12:27.340
Right.

12:27.390 --> 12:30.655
Sorry for blasting
in like this.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.431
Do you need a ride to your hotel
or do you have a car?

12:33.490 --> 12:35.572
I took a taxi here.

12:35.620 --> 12:39.056
But I'm afraid
my mobile reception is dodgy.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.410
Could I borrow yours?

12:41.450 --> 12:42.440
I'll be back soon.

12:42.500 --> 12:45.401
Okay. Bye.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.144
Here.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.579
Suddenly our Paris bubble was
feeling a bit crowded.

12:50.630 --> 12:53.986
And I had a million questions.

12:54.030 --> 12:55.373
Ida: Honey, you don't want
to ask him that.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.240
Why not? Why can't
I know why it ended?

12:57.290 --> 12:59.338
Because you need to focus
on beginnings,

12:59.380 --> 13:00.427
not endings.

13:00.470 --> 13:02.165
You have a solid,
loving marriage.

13:02.210 --> 13:04.076
Don't dig into
someone else's hamper.

13:04.130 --> 13:06.212
Ooh! Look. Peppers.

13:06.260 --> 13:08.866
I think you have
every right to ask.

13:08.910 --> 13:10.605
Poppy, leave it alone.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.129
Let's make
stuffed peppers.

13:12.180 --> 13:16.139
Which goes very nicely
with the cheeses o--

13:17.620 --> 13:19.042
God, this town
is too small.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.091
Is that the hooker?She's not a hooker.

13:21.140 --> 13:24.929
Of course not.
She's wearing glasses.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.369
Oh, jeez.
Why are you doing that?

13:26.410 --> 13:28.230
Wave? He's my dad.
What am I supposed to do?

13:28.280 --> 13:29.793
Look through him
like he doesn't exist?

13:29.850 --> 13:32.410
That's what I do.

13:32.460 --> 13:33.495
-Hi.
-Hi.

13:33.550 --> 13:34.972
Lauren, this is
my daughter, Stella.

13:35.030 --> 13:36.247
“Hello.

13:36.290 --> 13:37.678
My wife, Ida,

13:37.720 --> 13:38.937
and her partner,
Poppy.

13:38.990 --> 13:39.980
Pleasure.

13:40.030 --> 13:41.282
I figured this intro

13:41.340 --> 13:43.069
would've caused
a mushroom cloud.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.292
But look --

13:44.340 --> 13:46.809
NO screaming,
no name calling.

13:46.860 --> 13:49.386
Just mutual toleration.

13:49.430 --> 13:50.386
Okay, well...

13:50.430 --> 13:51.829
-Bye.
-Bye.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.998
She seems nice.
I'm glad for him.

13:54.050 --> 13:55.256
He's not wearing socks.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.391
Poppy: Is that
a big deal?

13:56.440 --> 13:57.874
My dad wears socks
to the beach.

13:57.920 --> 14:01.174
No one's seen his ankles
since like 1987.

14:01.230 --> 14:02.129
Mom?

14:02.180 --> 14:03.921
You sure you're okay
with this?

14:03.970 --> 14:06.098
Of course.

14:06.140 --> 14:07.835
Just interesting,
isn't it?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.403
I spent 30 years
loosening his lid

14:09.450 --> 14:11.407
so a stranger could
open the jar.

14:16.550 --> 14:18.154
Oh. I thought you
and Lauren were --

14:18.200 --> 14:20.419
I dropped her off
to get some rest

14:20.460 --> 14:21.939
before dinner.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.151
I'm exhausted.

14:23.210 --> 14:24.939
There's an energy drink
in the fridge.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.948
Forget drink.
I need a transfusion.

14:27.990 --> 14:29.515
This woman has
drained me.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.029
That is a big overshare.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.469
You came down on me real hard
about my toenail fungus.

14:34.520 --> 14:36.864
I think we could use
a little reciprocity here.

14:36.910 --> 14:38.912
Good word.
Sorry for sharing.

14:38.960 --> 14:40.348
I'll get out of your way.

14:40.400 --> 14:42.653
You're not in my way.
This is your home, too.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.395
Hey.

14:44.440 --> 14:47.000
What do you think of her?
Lauren.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.222
Wh-Wh-Why do you care
what I think?

14:49.270 --> 14:51.534
I'm in a brave
new world here, Aiden.

14:51.580 --> 14:54.186
The last time I dated,
it was your mother.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.938
Apps were appetizers.
Tinder was in the fireplace.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.368
I'm a little
out of practice.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.412
Maybe that's what
Lauren's into.

15:02.460 --> 15:05.452
What did you two talk about
when I was out?

15:05.510 --> 15:08.468
Did she say anything
about me?

15:08.510 --> 15:09.989
Sh-She didn't.

15:10.030 --> 15:12.032
I have to admit,
that first night with her

15:12.080 --> 15:14.549
was a little
anxiety-producing.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.386
You know what --
I get the feeling that

15:16.430 --> 15:17.955
she hasn't been
with anyone else

15:18.000 --> 15:20.037
since she and her husband
split up.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.649
Dad, look, if you thinking
that you and Lauren

15:21.700 --> 15:23.520
are gonna be a thing,
I--

15:23.570 --> 15:24.731
What is that?

15:24.790 --> 15:27.396
Lauren got it for me
from the Farmers Market.

15:27.440 --> 15:30.182
She said it would
"straighten out my chi."

15:30.230 --> 15:32.312
How's my chi looking?

15:32.360 --> 15:34.146
Huh?

15:34.190 --> 15:35.407
Am I embarrassing you?

15:35.450 --> 15:36.224
Nah.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.702
I don't embarrass easily.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.977
Figured that.

15:39.020 --> 15:40.533
You wouldn't be
wearing those shorts.

15:46.030 --> 15:48.499
Pippa must have called
for a London cabbie.

15:48.550 --> 15:50.029
Oh.

15:50.070 --> 15:51.765
Hey.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.687
Didn't expect you to...

15:54.730 --> 15:55.982
Yeah, neither did we.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.259
Um, after you left,
we got talking about

15:58.300 --> 16:00.211
Pippa's brother
and our co-workers.

16:00.260 --> 16:01.819
And then we devolved
into Brexit.

16:01.870 --> 16:02.996
Yeah.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.997
But now I am
definitely leaving.

16:07.350 --> 16:09.398
It was lovely
to meet you, Stella.

16:09.440 --> 16:13.445
Yeah, lovely
to meet you, too.

16:13.490 --> 16:15.925
Okay, well, give Nigel
and everyone my best.

16:15.970 --> 16:18.758
I will, indeed.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.270
I hope
you really heard me.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.322
I don't know how else
to say I'm sorry.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.419
What is she sorry for?

16:35.550 --> 16:37.461
For not showing up
to our wedding.

16:37.510 --> 16:39.774
You invited Pippa
to our wedding?

16:41.080 --> 16:44.300
No, Stella.

16:44.350 --> 16:46.034
I was supposed
to marry her.

16:50.790 --> 16:54.829
You had a wedding with Pippa?
And she didn't show up?

16:54.880 --> 16:56.484
So, what?

16:56.530 --> 17:01.058
Sh-She just left you
at the altar?

17:01.100 --> 17:02.659
How did you forget
to mention this?

17:02.710 --> 17:04.496
I didn't forget.

17:04.540 --> 17:05.973
And please --

17:06.020 --> 17:08.239
_Pleasedo not tell me
it was to "protect” me.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.839
So when was this
other wedding to Pippa?

17:13.900 --> 17:16.028
Five days
before I met you.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.338
So instead of your honeymoon,
you just went to Paris?

17:21.380 --> 17:23.769
Paris wasmy honeymoon.

17:23.819 --> 17:28.030
I went by myself
to figure out what I wanted.

17:28.089 --> 17:29.740
Once I found you,
I knew.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.043
No.

17:31.090 --> 17:32.865
No, you cannot do that.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.742
Th-That was my movie.
I was alone.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.872
You were traveling
with a ghost...

17:37.920 --> 17:39.308
named Pippa.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.055
Yes, Pippa and I had planned
to honeymoon in Paris,

17:41.100 --> 17:43.706
and yes, I went there in spite
of her more than anything.

17:43.750 --> 17:48.017
But once I got there,
I was a mess.

17:48.060 --> 17:49.710
I needed answers.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.319
I couldn't live
with the silence.

17:51.370 --> 17:53.805
I-I called her.
I left her multiple messages.

17:53.850 --> 17:55.022
While you were with me?

17:55.070 --> 17:56.890
Before we met.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.248
Stella, I didn't tell you

17:58.290 --> 18:01.112
because I couldn't even
say it to myself,

18:01.160 --> 18:03.379
much less out loud,
to you.

18:03.430 --> 18:04.943
It was humiliating.

18:06.690 --> 18:08.863
Pippa never returned
any of my calls,

18:08.910 --> 18:11.686
so finally, I gave up,

18:11.740 --> 18:14.562
and I threw my phone
into the Seine.

18:14.610 --> 18:17.307
I was bloody close
to tossing myself in, as well.

18:17.350 --> 18:18.909
But I wouldn't give her
that satisfaction.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.919
So I pulled myself together,
and I decided to leave Paris.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.366
But unfortunately,
without my damn phone,

18:31.410 --> 18:34.107
I couldn't find my way
back to the hotel.

18:34.150 --> 18:37.017
I was lost.
So I had to buy a map.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.322
And while I was
standing there,

18:38.370 --> 18:41.328
it occurred to me
that if I fled,

18:41.380 --> 18:43.246
Pippa would be
ruining a city for me

18:43.290 --> 18:45.509
that I've always loved.

18:45.550 --> 18:48.770
And I wouldn't give her
that either.

18:48.820 --> 18:52.074
So I grabbed my map,
I...

18:52.130 --> 18:55.259
And I bumped into you.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.859
And after that,

18:56.910 --> 18:58.696
everythingchanged.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.523
Stella, you're the one
who's always saying

19:03.570 --> 19:06.358
the universe steps in
to deliver people

19:06.400 --> 19:10.132
just when we need them most.

19:10.190 --> 19:13.490
That's what happened.

19:13.540 --> 19:15.440
Have you really
moved on?

19:15.500 --> 19:16.274
What?

19:16.320 --> 19:17.799
If you're still upset,

19:17.850 --> 19:19.625
it means that you still
have feelings.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.978
I'm upset because
she landed on our doorstep.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.977
I am, too!

19:26.380 --> 19:28.371
But if she hadn't,
would you have told me this?

19:28.420 --> 19:30.115
I never thought
I'd have to.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.504
Right.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.722
Yeah, you just thought
we'd have a six-month honeymoon

19:34.780 --> 19:35.679
and then I'd be dead.

19:35.730 --> 19:37.209
Stells, I'm sorry.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.957
Can you just help me
put these things away, please?

19:44.870 --> 19:47.043
Oh, wow.

19:47.090 --> 19:48.000
Sorry.

19:48.050 --> 19:49.267
Something wrong?

19:49.310 --> 19:50.653
No, no.

19:50.710 --> 19:52.872
There's just this great band
playing at The Ark.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.183
I went to undergrad
with the lead singer.

19:55.230 --> 19:56.482
You might know them.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.760
Not if they recorded
after the Bush Administration.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.665
The first one.

20:01.980 --> 20:05.359
Seriously, though,
they're so special.

20:05.420 --> 20:07.502
You want to go?
Yeah.

20:07.550 --> 20:08.847
When?

20:08.900 --> 20:09.503
Tonight.

20:09.550 --> 20:11.200
Tonight?
Mm-hmm.

20:11.250 --> 20:15.687
Uh...I've still got
five exams to grade.

20:15.730 --> 20:17.687
I sort of thought
we were in for the night.

20:17.730 --> 20:19.255
You've got plenty
of time.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.950
They're not gonna go on
before midnight.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.604
Can we catch them
over the weekend?

20:22.650 --> 20:25.779
Not unless you want
to go to Japan.

20:25.830 --> 20:27.434
They're gonna leave
tomorrow.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.825
But you would make
a very cute groupie.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.439
I'd make a sleepy groupie.

20:32.490 --> 20:34.265
I thought
I kept you awake.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.049
Believe me, you do.

20:36.100 --> 20:40.219
But after I get through these,
I'm gonna be comatose.

20:40.280 --> 20:41.532
Well...

20:41.580 --> 20:44.845
I have something
that might keep you up.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.242
My mother once told me
that the first thing

20:52.290 --> 20:53.724
you fight about
in a relationship

20:53.770 --> 20:57.593
is the thing you will
always fight about.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.244
How many other
"sins of omission"

20:59.300 --> 21:00.950
are coming my way?

21:00.990 --> 21:03.903
And why was I working so hard
to recapture Paris

21:03.950 --> 21:06.863
when what happened there
may have happened in my mind

21:06.910 --> 21:08.253
and not his?

21:13.140 --> 21:14.619
We need to talk.

21:17.530 --> 21:19.259
Do you want to come in?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.004
I want to know
why you left him.

21:21.060 --> 21:23.620
Why you'd book a church,
invite 80 people,

21:23.670 --> 21:27.049
buy a gown,
and not show up.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.844
You should probably come in.

21:32.550 --> 21:35.633
It makes no sense.
He made this appointment.

21:35.680 --> 21:37.375
Peter knew the closing
was today.

21:37.420 --> 21:39.980
Mr. Abbott's been
a little distracted lately.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.111
Don't say it like that.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.118
No worries.
I'm in no rush.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.389
Aiden?
What are you doing?

21:46.430 --> 21:47.738
Taking a shower.

21:47.780 --> 21:48.520
Here?

21:48.560 --> 21:50.039
Th-This house
is sold.

21:50.090 --> 21:52.513
Th-The Nortons have practically
moved in already.

21:52.570 --> 21:53.560
They're doing new
landscaping.

21:53.610 --> 21:55.123
Not in the shower.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.820
Well, you have the guesthouse.
He has the guesthouse.

21:57.880 --> 21:59.097
It's a little crowded.

21:59.140 --> 22:00.869
Why
He and Lauren?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.524
Who's Lauren?My husband's hooker.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.139
She's not, Mom.
She's a nice person.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.272
A nice person doesn't kick
someone out of their house.

22:06.320 --> 22:07.537
She didn't kick me out.

22:07.580 --> 22:09.537
Well, why is she bathing there
and not you?

22:09.580 --> 22:11.582
Oh, my God.
Is she homeless?

22:11.630 --> 22:13.405
Hardly. Her bathroom
IS awesome.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.064
Her shower has got
three nozzles.

22:15.110 --> 22:17.454
That seems excessive.Why would you know that?

22:17.510 --> 22:20.320
I gotta go.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.417
You've slept with her,
haven't you?

22:24.210 --> 22:25.985
Fine! Yes.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.428
Yes! Once!

22:27.470 --> 22:28.813
But you can't tell Dad.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.339
He doesn't know,
SO can you please,

22:30.390 --> 22:32.347
please not say anything?

22:32.390 --> 22:34.643
Quick. Give me
something to sign.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.567
Wes did nothing wrong,
Stella.

22:37.610 --> 22:38.827
It was all me.

22:38.870 --> 22:40.656
Pippa, I came here
to get the truth.

22:40.700 --> 22:42.304
That is the truth.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.318
Wes and I had known each other
since secondary school.

22:45.360 --> 22:47.488
Our families, our friends,
everyone just assumed

22:47.540 --> 22:48.575
this would
be the next step.

22:48.620 --> 22:49.792
Then why wasn't it?

22:49.840 --> 22:51.228
Because I realized
I was doing it

22:51.280 --> 22:54.500
to fulfill their expectations,
and not my own.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.100
Wes is a good man.

22:57.150 --> 23:00.108
That was the worst part --

23:00.160 --> 23:03.323
knowing I was going to hurt
the most honorable person

23:03.380 --> 23:04.893
I've ever met.

23:04.940 --> 23:07.375
I knew he would stay with it,
even if I knew I couldn't.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.206
So...

23:13.560 --> 23:15.073
Why are you here now?

23:15.130 --> 23:19.169
It might look selfish --
and maybe it is --

23:19.220 --> 23:21.780
but I can't move on

23:21.830 --> 23:24.049
until I'm certain
he's forgiven me.

23:24.090 --> 23:25.398
I'm sure he has.

23:25.440 --> 23:26.839
I'm not.

23:29.190 --> 23:31.704
And even if he has,
I...

23:31.750 --> 23:33.798
I feel like I've lost
my best friend.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.400
Look, there's no reason

23:36.450 --> 23:40.239
that we can't all
be friends.

23:40.280 --> 23:43.454
We can't all be married to him,
at least not in Oregon,

23:43.500 --> 23:46.720
but friendship
is perfectly legal.

23:46.770 --> 23:49.467
Did I really just say that?
It's not crazy, is it?

23:52.820 --> 23:54.470
Besides,
if my still-married parents

23:54.520 --> 23:56.648
could date other people
and be civil with each other,

23:56.690 --> 23:59.819
why not follow their example?

23:59.870 --> 24:01.907
Where the hell have
you been?Out.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.474
Well, we were expecting
you an hour ago.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.089
Sorry I'm late.

24:06.140 --> 24:07.210
I had to reach level three

24:07.270 --> 24:08.522
or I wouldn't get
my pachinko coins.

24:08.570 --> 24:09.742
You were at a casino?

24:09.790 --> 24:11.485
It's what you do
when the clubs close.

24:11.530 --> 24:12.873
You two went clubbing?

24:12.920 --> 24:14.615
Would anyone like to sign these?
I have a lovely pen.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.479
Ooh, that is lovely.
May I?

24:16.540 --> 24:18.019
Peter, what's going on
with you?

24:18.060 --> 24:20.711
He will be fine once
we have breakfast.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.661
After this, pancakes.You'll get your pancakes.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.881
Are you moving
this paper?

24:24.940 --> 24:26.237
Oh my God,
he's having a stroke.

24:26.290 --> 24:29.931
Peter, do you smell toast?
What is he on?

24:29.990 --> 24:32.800
He's on medication for
Attention Deficit Disorder.

24:32.860 --> 24:34.282
And, maybe,
a little bourbon.

24:34.340 --> 24:35.557
Drugs? Y-

24:35.600 --> 24:37.034
You're on drugs?

24:37.080 --> 24:38.297
Oh, please.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.126
Half of my son's
third grade class takes it.

24:40.170 --> 24:41.513
And two more.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.642
He can't eat soup
if he's taken an antihistamine!

24:43.690 --> 24:44.691
He'd drown!

24:44.740 --> 24:45.866
Why are you attacking me?

24:45.910 --> 24:49.653
I did not hold a gun
to his head.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.179
Look, if you have such
an issue with it,

24:51.220 --> 24:53.131
ask your son.

24:53.180 --> 24:54.614
I bought them from him
months ago.

24:54.660 --> 24:55.877
Was this before or after

24:55.920 --> 24:57.968
you slept with him
in your shower?

24:58.010 --> 24:58.613
What?

25:04.540 --> 25:07.362
And initial
here and here.

25:07.410 --> 25:08.969
Thanks, Mom.

25:12.770 --> 25:15.159
Pass the wine,
would you?

25:19.560 --> 25:23.258
Oh, it requires
a whole bottle?

25:23.300 --> 25:24.904
Would you do me a favor

25:24.950 --> 25:27.089
and open those cans
of tomato paste?

25:27.130 --> 25:29.121
We're ready for the
next stage. Are we?

25:29.170 --> 25:31.343
I can do that.
I'm done chopping.

25:31.390 --> 25:32.994
Great, thanks.

25:33.050 --> 25:36.827
Can you grab the onions
from the freezer?

25:36.880 --> 25:38.041
Why do they have
to be frozen?

25:38.100 --> 25:39.704
Something about enzymes.
Don't ask me.

25:39.750 --> 25:41.093
My mother explained
it in the car

25:41.140 --> 25:43.450
and I had to pull on my earlobes
to stay awake.

25:51.590 --> 25:52.546
Stells?

25:52.590 --> 25:53.364
Yep?

25:53.420 --> 25:55.070
Need your help.

25:55.110 --> 25:56.805
Yeah?
What are we doing?

25:56.850 --> 25:58.329
We're looking for onions
in the freezer.

25:58.380 --> 26:00.678
No. Why is she here I invited her.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.550
Oh, okay.
One more question.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.988
Why?
I felt bad.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.771
She's sitting in a hotel room
alone in a strange city.

26:06.820 --> 26:08.299
While you're married
to someone else.

26:08.340 --> 26:10.217
Well, that was her choice.She misses your friendship.

26:10.260 --> 26:12.900
I don't need any more friends.You need to forgive her.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.691
Here they are!

26:15.740 --> 26:17.788
So why this recipe?

26:17.830 --> 26:20.743
You must've had
other fabulous meals in Paris.

26:23.190 --> 26:25.227
Um...

26:25.270 --> 26:27.614
Well, we ate this

26:27.670 --> 26:29.752
on our last night.

26:31.980 --> 26:34.677
And honestly, I thought it might
be our last meal together.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.802
Just tell your mum
that you ate a bad snail.

26:36.850 --> 26:38.841
You need another week in Paris
to cough it up.

26:38.900 --> 26:40.288
If I spend
one more day here,

26:40.330 --> 26:42.765
my mother will have gendarmes
circling the hotel.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.630
I promise you.All right, fine.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.112
Then I'll just change
my reservation

26:46.160 --> 26:48.071
and follow you back
to the States.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.814
I just invited myself,
didn't I?

26:51.870 --> 26:54.646
Too brashNo.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.509
No.

26:59.090 --> 27:02.310
I just -- I never told you
the real reason why I came here.

27:02.350 --> 27:06.173
That's all right.
I never told you either.

27:06.230 --> 27:07.709
But we're here now.

27:07.750 --> 27:10.094
Doesn't really matter,
does it?

27:10.150 --> 27:11.276
It might.

27:13.190 --> 27:16.751
Wes, you can't
come home with me,

27:16.800 --> 27:19.064
unless you...

27:19.110 --> 27:21.454
have a thing
for hospital rooms.

27:23.330 --> 27:25.412
Stella: And then,
I took the plunge.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.076
When I was...

27:27.120 --> 27:30.340
I made it clear
my prognosis was bleak.

27:30.380 --> 27:32.337
Five, six months, tops.

27:35.910 --> 27:39.164
But to my surprise,
he didn't look away,

27:39.220 --> 27:40.301
He just...

27:42.530 --> 27:43.827
...stayed.

27:46.180 --> 27:49.741
That must've been the night
I saw you.

27:49.790 --> 27:51.610
You were there?
In Paris?

27:51.670 --> 27:53.923
I-I thought you said --
Yes.

27:55.840 --> 27:59.140
Well, when I tried
to reach Wes,

27:59.190 --> 28:01.670
I couldn't.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.755
I tried calling him.

28:02.810 --> 28:04.460
I tossed my phone
in the river.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.889
So I flew to Paris
and went to the restaurant

28:06.940 --> 28:08.897
where we'd made the reservation
weeks in advance,

28:08.940 --> 28:14.242
and when I walked in,
I saw you together.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.584
That was weird, huh?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.723
I mean, what if you'd been
sitting in my seat

28:52.770 --> 28:54.727
at the restaurant,
and you'd seen Pippa?

28:54.770 --> 28:57.762
Then I would've
seen Pippa.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.595
Yeah.

28:59.650 --> 29:00.947
What if you hadn't
tossed your phone?

29:01.000 --> 29:03.037
Why are you asking
so many "what ifs"?

29:03.080 --> 29:04.957
Because we might not
be standing here right now.

29:05.000 --> 29:06.604
Yeah, but I did
all those things,

29:06.650 --> 29:09.085
and we are standing here,
so what's the point?

29:09.130 --> 29:12.566
Wes, you decided what to tell me
and what to keep to yourself.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.042
And so did you.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.262
You didn't tell me you were sick
until that dinner.

29:16.310 --> 29:17.789
Why would I?

29:17.840 --> 29:19.569
I went to Paris
to escape that.

29:19.620 --> 29:21.759
I-I wanted to know what
it felt like to meet someone

29:21.800 --> 29:23.928
and not that be the first thing
they saw when they looked at me.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.756
All right, and how would
you have perceived me

29:25.800 --> 29:29.839
if I'd have just told you
I'd been ditched at the altar?

29:29.890 --> 29:32.587
I'm sorry, but if I'd have
shared all this you,

29:32.640 --> 29:33.846
then you would have
thought you were

29:33.900 --> 29:35.584
some kind of rebound
and this wasn't real.

29:35.640 --> 29:38.200
I'm thinking that now
because I wasthe rebound!

29:38.250 --> 29:39.593
All right,
maybe you were!

29:39.640 --> 29:41.335
But that doesn't mean
that this isn't real!

29:41.380 --> 29:42.779
I saw your face
when she told you

29:42.820 --> 29:44.720
that she came to Paris. That's called "shock."

29:44.780 --> 29:47.909
No, this looked a lot
more like regret.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.826
Wes, I made it past
my expiration date,

29:49.870 --> 29:52.430
and I know that you told me
you were gonna love me forever.

29:52.480 --> 29:53.868
But now I know that
there is someone else

29:53.920 --> 29:55.604
you may have said those
exact same things to, as well,

29:55.660 --> 29:57.082
so what's really real?

30:11.980 --> 30:13.800
How long has this
been going on?

30:13.850 --> 30:15.932
I think it happened once.
Possibly in her shower.

30:15.980 --> 30:18.244
I'm not talking about
Aiden and Lauren.

30:18.290 --> 30:20.600
I'm talking about
his "job."

30:20.640 --> 30:22.460
Oh, that.

30:22.510 --> 30:23.853
I knew he sold weed
years ago.

30:23.900 --> 30:25.777
But I certainly didn't
know about pills.

30:25.820 --> 30:26.946
If you knew about the weed,

30:26.990 --> 30:28.549
why didn't you say
something then?

30:28.600 --> 30:30.511
I had a daughter who was
fighting for her life.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.426
I wasn't looking
in that direction.

30:32.480 --> 30:33.641
Fair enough.

30:33.700 --> 30:35.737
_ But we can't
ignore this anymore.

30:35.790 --> 30:37.087
Fine. Talk to him.

30:37.130 --> 30:40.043
But be upset about the drugs,
not Lauren.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.967
I think he didn't tell you
for the same reason

30:42.010 --> 30:43.444
he didn't tell me --

30:43.490 --> 30:46.539
He was trying
to protect you.

30:46.580 --> 30:48.924
When did our kids start
protecting us?

30:48.970 --> 30:51.189
Probably when I started
drinking vodka in a bush

30:51.240 --> 30:53.925
and you started sleeping with
the same woman as your son.

31:00.980 --> 31:02.505
I didn't want to sleep at home,

31:02.550 --> 31:04.336
so I decided to go crash
at the place

31:04.380 --> 31:06.724
where I'd always done
my best thinking.

31:06.770 --> 31:11.207
[ Cold War Kids and Bishop
Briggs' "Love On The Brain" plays ]

31:11.260 --> 31:15.868
Oh, and, babe,
I'm fist-fighting with fire

31:15.910 --> 31:18.823
Just to get close
to you

31:18.870 --> 31:22.875
Can't we burn something,
baby?

31:22.920 --> 31:29.360
And I'll run for miles
just to get a taste

31:29.400 --> 31:35.237
Must be love on the brain

31:35.280 --> 31:39.194
That's got me cursing
my name

31:39.240 --> 31:40.799
Cursing my name

31:40.850 --> 31:43.364
No matter what I do

31:43.420 --> 31:45.718
I'm no good without you

31:45.770 --> 31:48.990
And I can't get enough

31:49.030 --> 31:51.943
Must be love on the

31:51.990 --> 31:55.597
Brain

31:55.650 --> 31:58.426
What are you doing here?

31:58.480 --> 31:59.697
What are you
doing here?

31:59.740 --> 32:01.253
You're supposed to be
at a fundraiser.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.210
You're supposed to be
in a Paris bubble.

32:03.260 --> 32:05.957
Yeah, well, we had
an unexpected guest,

32:06.010 --> 32:07.489
and the bubble
kind of burst.

32:07.530 --> 32:08.964
I had an unexpected patient

32:09.010 --> 32:10.967
whose stitches
kind of burst.

32:11.010 --> 32:12.262
You win.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.220
Did you get my text?

32:14.280 --> 32:16.669
I did.

32:16.710 --> 32:17.666
Why didn't you answer?

32:17.710 --> 32:18.927
I couldn't.

32:18.980 --> 32:22.621
I was busy entertaining
my husband's...

32:22.670 --> 32:25.492
fiance.

32:25.550 --> 32:27.370
Ex-fiance.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.024
Ouch.

32:29.070 --> 32:33.849
Is that why you're, uh,
you're here instead of there?

32:33.900 --> 32:35.982
It's complicated.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.075
Anyway, I'm --

32:37.120 --> 32:38.997
I'm just impressed
that you did it.

32:39.040 --> 32:39.939
Did what?

32:40.000 --> 32:41.252
Got married.

32:41.300 --> 32:45.089
At such a young age,
it's a big leap of faith.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.169
I know I could've
never done it.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.268
Why not?

32:51.310 --> 32:54.701
I spent most of my 20s
with my nose in books

32:54.750 --> 32:57.060
and my hands
in a cadaver.

32:57.100 --> 33:00.013
I got friends my age that have
kids starting middle school now,

33:00.060 --> 33:03.849
and I'm still busy
paying back student loans.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.450
Just feel like I kind of
missed out on a lot.

33:10.680 --> 33:12.762
I'm sorry. That was --

33:12.810 --> 33:14.596
That was completely insensitive,
implying that --

33:14.640 --> 33:16.950
that I missed out on a lot

33:16.990 --> 33:19.118
when you spent seven years
in and out of treatment.

33:19.170 --> 33:20.160
Eight.

33:20.210 --> 33:21.382
You win.

33:26.870 --> 33:28.122
I should go. Yeah.

33:28.180 --> 33:32.083
Let you take a nap
and get on with whatever.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.949
Yeah, I gotta open up
the coffee shop.

33:34.010 --> 33:35.353
Open it?
You mean close it?

33:35.400 --> 33:37.914
Yeah, that, too. Bye.

33:37.970 --> 33:41.190
So much for this
being my "safe" place.

33:41.230 --> 33:44.279
How many people can there be
in one marriage?

33:46.890 --> 33:48.881
May I come in?

33:59.990 --> 34:04.518
If I could just
go back 10 years

34:04.560 --> 34:10.168
And see you're
doing fine, my dear

34:10.219 --> 34:12.348
Don't let them tell you...

34:16.440 --> 34:19.967
You're in love,
and in time, you'll see

34:20.010 --> 34:21.170
Daddy?
Hey.

34:21.230 --> 34:23.096
Hi.
What're you doing here?

34:23.139 --> 34:25.188
I was taking a long walk.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.358
And I hear that sleep
is overrated.

34:27.409 --> 34:29.139
Why're you here
so early?

34:29.190 --> 34:30.748
I wasn't supposed to be.

34:30.800 --> 34:35.237
But...I asked Finley
for a double shift.

34:35.290 --> 34:37.018
Why?

34:37.070 --> 34:38.196
Oh.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.891
It's a long story.

34:41.940 --> 34:43.817
Did you sleep here
last night?

34:43.860 --> 34:47.376
Tossed and turned.
Mostly tossed.

34:49.429 --> 34:51.080
Is everything okay

34:51.130 --> 34:52.473
with you and Wes?

34:57.920 --> 34:59.046
Not really.

35:01.830 --> 35:04.140
But I guess you can't complain
that your husband's a mystery

35:04.180 --> 35:08.538
if you got married to him after
knowing him for 10 minutes.

35:08.580 --> 35:10.753
Honey...

35:10.800 --> 35:13.144
he'll always be
a mystery.

35:13.190 --> 35:15.272
You can never know everything
about a person,

35:15.330 --> 35:17.401
even if you share
the same bed.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.542
I was married to your mother
for 30 years.

35:19.590 --> 35:24.152
But I stopped
asking questions.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.589
And the day you stop...

35:26.640 --> 35:29.723
the marriage is over.

35:29.770 --> 35:32.125
You gotta keep asking,

35:32.170 --> 35:35.470
even if you're scared
of the answers.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.610
I'm just
trying to find my way back

35:40.660 --> 35:43.174
to the guy that
I met in Paris.

35:44.660 --> 35:47.960
And maybe he doesn't exist.
Maybe he never did.

35:48.010 --> 35:52.709
Maybe you have to stop worrying
about who he was

35:52.750 --> 35:55.276
and focus on who he is.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.924
Now.

35:58.760 --> 36:02.492
You don't scare easily,
Stell Belle.

36:02.550 --> 36:04.507
I still see
the fearless 3-year-old,

36:04.550 --> 36:06.939
running around naked
in our garden,

36:06.990 --> 36:12.167
chasing dragonflies with
your plastic blue teapot.

36:12.210 --> 36:13.985
Wait, why was I naked?

36:14.040 --> 36:16.168
Every time we put clothes
on you,

36:16.210 --> 36:18.292
you tore them off.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.000
I guess you thought
they slowed you down.

36:20.040 --> 36:25.217
If I could just
go back 10 years

36:25.270 --> 36:31.004
And see you're
doing fine, my dear

36:32.620 --> 36:34.224
Sorry if I woke you.

36:34.270 --> 36:35.487
You didn't.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.884
I'm still
on London time.

36:40.980 --> 36:42.493
Does Stella know
you're here?

36:42.540 --> 36:44.622
Uh...no.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.456
No, she left shortly
after you last night.

36:47.500 --> 36:50.856
I haven't heard
from her since.

36:50.900 --> 36:52.675
It's the first night
that we've been apart

36:52.730 --> 36:54.550
for six months.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.510
I hope it wasn't
something I said.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.119
It was.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.733
Wes, I told you,
I only came to --

37:03.780 --> 37:05.475
I know why you came.

37:08.570 --> 37:11.130
I forgive you.

37:12.700 --> 37:16.352
In fact,
I want to thank you.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.870
It's because of you
I turned left instead of right.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.058
That's how I met Stella.

37:22.100 --> 37:24.888
Can I tell you why
I really went to Paris?

37:24.930 --> 37:27.149
It doesn't matter now.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.623
I mean, maybe before...

37:29.680 --> 37:30.806
but not now.

37:30.850 --> 37:32.193
It's too late.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.809
Well, I guess you won't
be pleased to hear

37:33.860 --> 37:36.670
that I got the job
in San Francisco.

37:36.730 --> 37:39.028
Congratulations.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.241
Right.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.120
You have to leave.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.217
Seeing you again,

37:51.260 --> 37:53.342
just being in
the same room with you,

37:53.400 --> 37:58.270
it -- it made me think
about old times,

37:58.310 --> 38:00.312
good times.

38:01.620 --> 38:03.099
And I thought
it would be brilliant

38:03.150 --> 38:08.589
_ if we can still be
in each others' lives.

38:08.630 --> 38:10.405
And if there was ever
a chance --

38:10.460 --> 38:11.973
There isn't.

38:13.290 --> 38:16.988
And it doesn't matter
where you are, Pippa.

38:17.030 --> 38:19.067
= I'm in love
with someone else.

38:40.920 --> 38:42.354
Good morning.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.879
Yeah?

38:43.930 --> 38:46.137
Aiden, you never cease
to surprise me.

38:46.190 --> 38:48.796
Dad, look, I didn't know how
to tell you about me and Lauren.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.706
I was referring
to the eggs.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.797
Didn't realize you knew how
to turn on the stove.

38:52.850 --> 38:55.194
Do you want some?

38:55.240 --> 38:57.368
I can give you the part
that's not charred.

38:57.420 --> 38:59.843
I'll hold off, thanks.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.629
Are you going out
later with --

39:01.680 --> 39:03.114
Lauren?

39:03.160 --> 39:04.332
No.

39:06.690 --> 39:08.909
I think we're done.

39:08.950 --> 39:11.556
Can I just say that I think
that that's a really good move?

39:11.610 --> 39:14.773
I like her and everything,
but I think you can do better.

39:14.830 --> 39:17.470
And you can do better than
selling ADHD meds

39:17.520 --> 39:19.568
to desperate soccer moms.

39:19.610 --> 39:21.396
Here we go.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.306
We should have had
this conversation

39:23.360 --> 39:24.395
a long time ago.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.965
Dad, I know it's not
a career choice.

39:26.010 --> 39:28.661
I just kind of
fell into it.

39:28.710 --> 39:30.883
Fall into
something else.

39:36.720 --> 39:40.543
It's not like I haven't thought
about doing other things.

39:41.900 --> 39:44.289
What do you think about
me being an EMT?

39:44.330 --> 39:45.855
I like driving fast.

39:45.900 --> 39:49.074
I mean, I don't technically
have a valid license,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.430
but...

39:52.860 --> 39:54.464
Dad...

39:57.000 --> 39:58.297
Dad?

40:04.140 --> 40:07.838
You called me again,
and I'm tempted to bend

40:07.880 --> 40:10.872
All the rules
that I made for myself

40:10.930 --> 40:14.571
And I know that I will

40:16.320 --> 40:19.847
Is this the day that
you'll ask me to stay?

40:19.890 --> 40:21.972
All the curfews I'll breaks

40:22.020 --> 40:25.718
All the tears that I gave
just for you

40:25.770 --> 40:28.193
How is it?

40:28.250 --> 40:29.934
It's good.

40:29.990 --> 40:32.072
You want a bowl?

40:32.120 --> 40:32.985
Sure.

40:33.030 --> 40:35.681
There's plenty of it.

40:35.730 --> 40:39.337
And I wanted to...

40:39.390 --> 40:41.427
Pippa's gone.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.130
She left early.

40:46.050 --> 40:48.473
Did you have something
to do with that?

40:48.530 --> 40:51.431
I did.

40:51.490 --> 40:55.870
I'm not sticking this out
to fulfill a promise, Stella.

40:55.930 --> 40:59.571
This is not out of duty.
