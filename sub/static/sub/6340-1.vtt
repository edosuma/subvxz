02:09.960 --> 02:12.925
Stand aside. Let us pass.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.765
Buntin, you landlord bastard!

02:21.960 --> 02:27.929
<i>Her beautiful eyes
were a terrible curse</i>

02:28.040 --> 02:33.883
<i>Three days in his grave
She ran off with his purse</i>

02:34.080 --> 02:38.119
Lads, that bloody landlord
Buntin's on his way in.

02:38.120 --> 02:39.279
All hell's breaking loose.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.561
Buntin?

02:42.920 --> 02:44.849
I hope they kill him.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.281
Would you look at
that bastard, Joe?

02:49.360 --> 02:51.879
Landlord!
You're a sinner!

02:51.880 --> 02:55.239
Between your lungs, there's
neither heart nor spirit,

02:55.240 --> 02:59.161
but the lump of your own
swollen money bag.

02:59.840 --> 03:02.122
He'll never get over that one, Joe.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.968
You're a blight on this country
that never belonged to you.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.730
Out, you robber!

03:24.760 --> 03:26.803
Joe, come on.
Are you hurt?

03:28.960 --> 03:32.881
Take me home to my sons.

03:57.720 --> 03:59.046
Back!

04:00.840 --> 04:03.042
Stand still, you ugly animal.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.210
Whoa, you ugly...

04:08.840 --> 04:11.159
Damn you.
The hell with you.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.691
Colm!
What?

04:13.560 --> 04:18.447
Will you look at our little brother?
He can't keep hold of his ass.

04:20.279 --> 04:21.759
Sweetheart of a child.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.799
Slaving away.
Is it not enough, Joseph,

04:23.800 --> 04:25.759
you plowed all
that muck down there?

04:25.760 --> 04:29.806
My ambition's a little grander
than yours, a couple of lazy cows.

04:29.920 --> 04:33.399
Ambition, is it? To break your
back on land that isn't your own?

04:33.400 --> 04:35.679
It belongs to the
landlord Christie.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.882
Hold your face up, lad.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.199
Come on.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.607
Give us something we can aim at.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.491
Shag off, the pair of you.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.279
There's a goat over there.
Go improve your love life.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.121
Come on now, Joseph. Just a
nosebleed's all we're asking.

04:51.760 --> 04:53.883
I've no wish to fight you.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.880
Try pummelling me,
you arrogant son of a bitch.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.849
Get him!

05:14.680 --> 05:17.247
Watch him.
He's riled up now.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.486
Hold still now.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.810
Stand up, Joseph.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.246
Lads, your father's been damaged.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.165
You're here, Joe.

05:45.440 --> 05:46.641
Da!

05:47.600 --> 05:48.801
Da!

05:51.280 --> 05:53.959
He took on the enemy
with his own bare hands.

05:53.960 --> 05:57.881
Fifty of them.
Armed and with hideous guns.

05:58.320 --> 06:02.759
Yeah, and your father,
he walloped them all.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.964
One by one, the whole lot of them.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.719
And I killed off a fair share
myself, to tell you the truth.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.843
Quiet, Danty Duff, for once.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.281
Humble as I am, I'll keep that part
of the story for another time.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.799
How are you feeling now, Da?

06:20.800 --> 06:23.082
My soul is departing
from me, Joseph.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.399
Don't you talk that way.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.479
I'll talk any way I please.
I'm dying, I tell you.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.365
You can't die.
We need you here, Da.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.921
Need me? What for?

06:34.320 --> 06:39.481
<i>Her beautiful eyes
were a terrible curse</i>

06:49.880 --> 06:51.206
Da?

06:52.680 --> 06:54.530
God bless your soul.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.124
Poor Joe Donnelly.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.159
We'd be as well to sell off a thing
or two now that the old man's gone.

07:03.160 --> 07:06.364
Is that any way to keen over
the death of our father?

07:06.480 --> 07:08.679
Misery's a personal matter, Joseph.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.799
We don't need any
instruction, thanks.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.924
He's left us with a huge
debt of rent on the land.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.891
We'll begin to settle our debts
when we harvest the land.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.159
Grow the potatoes and pick them
yourself, Joseph, you ambitious boy.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.044
You son of a...
Joseph!

07:23.600 --> 07:25.564
Saints preserve us!

07:27.200 --> 07:28.639
We thought you'd died, Da.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.730
I did, son.
I passed away.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.839
But you're talking to us, Da,
and your eyes are looking about.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.439
I was as dead as a stone,
I tell you.

07:39.440 --> 07:42.120
Now shut your mouth
before I die again.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.401
Come here.

07:49.200 --> 07:51.767
I've come back to
tell you something.

07:57.400 --> 08:01.321
You're an especially odd boy.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.409
You came back from the dead
to tell me that I'm odd?

08:06.880 --> 08:11.927
You have all kinds of oddities
clattering around in your brain.

08:12.880 --> 08:15.447
So had I when I was
as young as you.

08:15.520 --> 08:19.441
But dreams, my boy, in this
poor corner of the world,

08:19.600 --> 08:21.723
end up in a glass of ale.

08:24.080 --> 08:28.524
Not my dreams.
I'll work my own land someday.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.530
Without land a man is nothing.

08:36.520 --> 08:41.328
Land is a man's very own soul.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.401
Yeah.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.923
A miracle, that's
what you're looking for.

08:48.920 --> 08:53.170
And by God, if you manage it,

08:53.600 --> 08:58.601
your old da will be smiling
down on you from heaven above.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.284
<i>Her beautiful eyes</i>

09:32.920 --> 09:35.521
God bless your soul, Joe Donnelly.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.244
For the second time.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.849
God rest your soul, Da.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.568
Say nothing to them, lads.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.811
This country's ours.
They don't exist.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.970
What dead man is this?

10:59.240 --> 11:01.124
What dead man is this?

11:01.600 --> 11:04.167
You needn't answer,
but hear these words.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.282
I represent Mr. Daniel Christie,

11:08.040 --> 11:11.926
who by right of law owns this land
and all improvements upon it.

11:15.520 --> 11:18.159
Rent on this property
has not been paid.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.522
The warning's been given thrice.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.368
Keep walking, lads. Our
father's being buried today.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.488
Bastards are burning our house!

11:40.640 --> 11:42.444
That will do.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.919
Where is this landlord Christie?

11:49.920 --> 11:52.043
I want justice for what he's done.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.799
There's nothing I like better

12:13.800 --> 12:16.924
than the glow of murder
in a young fella's eyes.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.648
It has a terrible go of rust on it.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.362
I've only killed
chickens and pigs till now.

12:24.800 --> 12:29.130
He's a pig and a chicken all in
one, the same Daniel Christie.

12:29.840 --> 12:33.249
Here now, give him
a proper taste of death.

12:35.560 --> 12:38.047
Yeah, landlords!

12:43.480 --> 12:45.250
Captain Moonlight.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.485
Captain Moonlight.

12:49.760 --> 12:51.759
Don't you be
pretending you know what

12:51.760 --> 12:53.799
Captain Moonlight means,
'cause you don't.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.199
It's the code, the rebel code.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.051
Now you've heard it,
keep it to yourself.

13:00.480 --> 13:03.639
Don't breathe it to a living
soul, you understand now?

13:03.640 --> 13:05.649
Yeah. Yeah.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.168
Captain Moonlight, Joseph.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.159
Off to kill your landlord?

13:16.160 --> 13:18.522
Blow the bastard's head off.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.523
Don't be afraid to kill him.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.843
Assassinate the bastard.

13:27.880 --> 13:31.482
Joseph, it was too good
to be kept a secret, son.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.719
Would you know which end of the gun

13:34.720 --> 13:36.199
to point at the gentleman's ear?

13:36.200 --> 13:38.479
He'll shoot himself in
the balls, I'll wager,

13:38.480 --> 13:40.887
and come hobbling home in tears!

13:42.440 --> 13:45.325
Goodbye, Colm.
Goodbye, Paddy.

13:45.720 --> 13:48.571
Goodbye, Joseph.
We'll see you at your wake.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.759
God bless all in this house.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.450
God bless you, son.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.568
Down from the north, are you?

16:03.720 --> 16:06.127
Or perhaps the east?

16:08.480 --> 16:10.284
West of here maybe?

16:11.080 --> 16:12.441
South?

16:13.720 --> 16:16.359
I prefer to keep my business
to myself, if you please.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.722
Very wise, very wise, very wise.

16:20.760 --> 16:22.759
God bless you, every one.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.679
God bless you, sir.

16:26.560 --> 16:28.159
Whiskey for everyone.

16:28.160 --> 16:29.805
Great, great.

16:32.480 --> 16:34.569
How are you, sir, tonight?

16:34.800 --> 16:38.607
Oppressed.
That's the word for me.

16:39.040 --> 16:42.159
I live in a house
that's stuffy and dull.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.682
And worse, I've a wife
who forbids me to drink.

16:46.280 --> 16:48.919
I crave adventure, boys.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.964
If I had wings,
I'd fly to the stars.

16:52.280 --> 16:53.879
Your good health, sir.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.439
To your good health, sir.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.529
To your health, Mr. Christie.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.726
Liven up, lad.

17:12.280 --> 17:15.006
You're too young to be
brooding in your ale.

17:17.319 --> 17:21.605
What places you in this
small chapter of the world?

17:22.319 --> 17:25.285
He's keeping himself
to himself, that one.

17:26.359 --> 17:30.239
Then it's one of two things,
enterprise or love.

17:30.240 --> 17:33.046
It isn't love,
rest assured of that.

17:33.480 --> 17:37.241
Then you're a man of
business, like myself.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.131
But I warn you,

17:40.960 --> 17:43.322
it's brought me nothing but misery.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.719
I'm lost in a fog
of commerce and compromise.

17:46.720 --> 17:51.209
I'd trade it all away
for 15 minutes of freedom.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.371
Freedom is a rare thing
in these parts.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.800
It is.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.319
It is, indeed.
It is.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.851
Indeed, it is.

18:11.600 --> 18:15.202
To a long and happy life,
Mr. Christie.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.844
God bless you, lad.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.291
<i>Why should I expire?</i>

18:28.360 --> 18:31.131
<i>For the fire of any eye</i>

18:32.280 --> 18:35.039
<i>Though foolish men you slay</i>

18:35.040 --> 18:37.004
<i>For thee I shall not die</i>

18:42.760 --> 18:48.683
<i>Your beauty and your name
will never conquer me</i>

18:49.200 --> 18:51.084
<i>What have I done?</i>

18:58.320 --> 18:59.601
Hello,

19:00.400 --> 19:02.443
souls of the departed.

19:04.600 --> 19:07.804
What a disappointment
I must seem to you all.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.725
Here we are.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.044
I recognize these hedges
by their dullness.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.685
<i>Oh, woman high of fame</i>

19:31.080 --> 19:34.363
<i>Though men have died for thee</i>

19:57.440 --> 19:59.642
This is a difficult murder.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.248
Good evening, Mr. Christie.

20:08.440 --> 20:10.165
Take the horse.

20:46.000 --> 20:49.841
Shannon, I saw you
galloping in the fields.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.841
Dignity, Shannon. Dignity.

20:53.280 --> 20:57.239
A lady must always be civilized
even when she rides.

20:57.240 --> 20:58.999
No one saw me riding, Mother.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.199
I saw you.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.526
Yes, Mother.

21:13.720 --> 21:16.685
"A lady must always be civilized."

21:17.040 --> 21:18.999
She never leaves us alone,
does she?

21:20.080 --> 21:21.691
No, she doesn't.

21:22.520 --> 21:25.451
There, go on, good girl.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.245
Somebody there?

22:44.840 --> 22:46.724
Stay right where you are.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.641
Don't flutter an eyelid
or I'll stab you.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.410
I'll stab you through.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.365
Father!

23:14.840 --> 23:16.166
Jesus!

23:23.640 --> 23:27.049
Father! Father!

23:28.960 --> 23:32.050
Father! Father!

23:32.680 --> 23:35.884
Father, help! Help!

23:36.000 --> 23:38.726
I've been all but raped
and slaughtered.

23:38.760 --> 23:39.839
What is it?

23:39.840 --> 23:40.919
In the stables.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.439
What's all the fuss about?

23:42.440 --> 23:44.005
It's the devil himself.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.520
Mr. Daniel Christie.

23:47.720 --> 23:48.839
Look!

23:50.040 --> 23:51.241
Yes?

23:51.800 --> 23:53.684
I'm Joseph Donnelly

23:53.840 --> 23:57.601
of the family Donnelly
that you pushed off our land.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.199
What in the name of God
are you talking about?

24:00.200 --> 24:03.404
Prepare to pay for your crimes.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.401
No!
Father!

24:06.480 --> 24:08.250
Good Lord Jesus!

24:17.360 --> 24:20.086
Captain Moonlight.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.524
Shannon, come back.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.845
Quickly! Find Mr. Chase
and bring him here. Go!

24:29.440 --> 24:31.369
Shannon, come inside.

24:32.400 --> 24:34.284
Shannon, turn around.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.479
Look how black his
fingers are, Mother.

24:44.480 --> 24:48.890
Never mind his fingers.
He's a lowborn blatherskite of filth.

24:49.960 --> 24:53.319
If he's so worthless, then why are
you bothering to dress his wounds?

24:53.320 --> 24:55.919
Our duty is to
restore him to full health

24:55.920 --> 24:57.519
so he can hear his own neck crack

24:57.520 --> 25:00.451
when he dangles from
the hangman's noose.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.967
Turn away, Shannon, and protect
the innocence of your eyes.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.803
Of all the days to intrude
upon our peaceful life.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.810
The ladies are coming by
this afternoon for tea.

25:13.840 --> 25:16.611
I'm feeling very sick
all of a sudden.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.559
Mind yourself, Shannon,

25:18.560 --> 25:20.649
those ladies are models
of manners and behavior.

25:27.640 --> 25:29.399
Nothing happened.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.119
Nothing happened, indeed.

25:35.160 --> 25:38.519
A poor misguided robin
has broken a windowpane.

25:38.520 --> 25:41.039
What a manufactured lie.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.607
I was dusting the liquor cabinet.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.759
As if a bottle in your vicinity

25:45.760 --> 25:47.279
stood long enough to gather dust.

25:47.280 --> 25:48.970
Go upstairs...

25:53.400 --> 25:57.127
<i>Mary, Mary, Mary Nell</i>

25:57.480 --> 26:01.162
<i>Do you hear
your wedding bell?</i>

26:02.520 --> 26:06.281
<i>Will he love you, Mary Nell?</i>

26:06.640 --> 26:10.287
<i>Time and time alone will tell</i>

26:54.720 --> 26:58.003
You're having a dream. This
isn't really happening. No.

26:58.360 --> 27:02.645
I want my land.

27:18.320 --> 27:21.091
Whatever became of
the man I married?

27:21.600 --> 27:25.088
Some other man's replaced him
and goes about with his name.

27:28.320 --> 27:31.799
A murderous insurgent
under your own roof.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.365
How horrible.

27:33.400 --> 27:37.239
He's as ugly as sin and
the most vicious creature

27:37.240 --> 27:39.442
I've ever set eyes upon.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.768
Did you get a look at him, Shannon?

27:47.840 --> 27:49.041
A peek.

27:49.800 --> 27:51.919
Shannon, what is your collar doing?

27:51.920 --> 27:53.559
It's choking me.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.923
Well, do it up. Better to
choke than to be vulgar.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.199
I hear a noise.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.079
Let us hope it is Stephen Chase.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.011
We've come for your
prisoner, Mr. Christie.

28:07.120 --> 28:10.961
Good afternoon, Mrs. Christie.
Good afternoon, ladies.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.519
Speak of the sun
and we see its rays.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.959
Oh, my goodness,
we were so frightened.

28:18.960 --> 28:21.606
Now, now, keep calm.
You're safe and protected.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.607
Go back to your
sinful card playing.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.845
Hello, Shannon.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.685
Hello, Stephen.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.003
My, how handsome he is.

28:40.200 --> 28:43.559
He's a brilliant young man.
He was educated at Trinity.

28:43.560 --> 28:44.799
Of course!

28:44.800 --> 28:47.162
He manages all my husband's
business affairs.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.839
Your daughter's
certainly a very lucky girl.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.610
Yes, indeed.

29:14.840 --> 29:19.443
Shannon, the ladies and I would
like you to play the piano.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.761
No.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.724
I beg your pardon?

29:28.800 --> 29:32.288
Come play something, Shannon.
Something fanciful and nice.

30:06.560 --> 30:08.649
She plays beautifully.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.239
Shannon, good gracious, child.

30:31.240 --> 30:33.159
It's band music, Mother.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.719
Band music?

30:34.720 --> 30:37.519
It's very modern.
It's from America.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.449
Shannon, stay back.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.845
Careful, boy, your life's
worth little as it is.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.966
You're the bastard
that burned my father's house.

31:26.400 --> 31:30.400
I've burned many houses in the line
of duty. Am I meant to remember yours?

31:37.160 --> 31:38.885
Maybe you'll remember this.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.407
Pistols, tomorrow at dawn.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.324
Get him upstairs.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.206
Go on!

32:11.160 --> 32:15.001
Come, ladies. Let us resume our
pleasantries in the parlor.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.007
Come here.
You, too, Shannon.

32:25.760 --> 32:29.567
What's buzzing around inside that
head of yours, my little monkey?

32:30.880 --> 32:33.128
The day's been disrupted, Father.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.090
Heaven forbid.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.010
I'm running away.

33:27.080 --> 33:28.611
Excuse me.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.321
There's something in here I need.

33:38.680 --> 33:42.680
Perhaps you're wondering
why I'm running away.

33:44.640 --> 33:46.330
I'll tell you.

33:46.480 --> 33:49.126
I'm running away
because I'm modern.

33:50.240 --> 33:54.240
I'm modern and I'm
going to a modern place.

33:54.960 --> 33:57.359
You're not the only
one who's trapped.

33:57.360 --> 34:02.122
If I stay here, my mother will turn me
into one of her stuffy old friends.

34:03.440 --> 34:07.201
No, thank you. I'm a little
more interesting than that.

34:10.080 --> 34:12.159
I'm very smart and very modern.

34:12.159 --> 34:14.328
That's all you
need to know about me.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.170
Boy, here.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.409
Have a look at this.

34:20.480 --> 34:21.726
Look!

34:27.159 --> 34:30.364
You can't read, can you?
How pathetic.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.565
"Land," it says.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.366
Land?

34:39.320 --> 34:41.998
"Wanted, strong,
healthy men and women.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.478
"Every resident of
the United States

34:44.480 --> 34:47.001
"is entitled to 160 acres of land."

34:47.840 --> 34:51.043
They've got so much of it,
they give it away for free.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.402
Noland is given away

34:56.800 --> 34:59.048
in any part of the world.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.171
In America it is,
and I'm going there.

35:03.760 --> 35:05.928
I'm going to have
a place of my own.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.479
I'll have horses on it
and I'll raise them,

35:08.480 --> 35:11.331
and I will ride
them any way I please.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.559
What do you need more land for?

35:13.560 --> 35:17.242
You own half of Ireland as it is.
They took it, your people did.

35:19.760 --> 35:21.039
I didn't take it.

35:21.040 --> 35:25.165
You just live here
all fancied up on rent

35:25.600 --> 35:27.131
and broken backs.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.960
Boy, you said you wanted land.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.290
If that's what you want,
then come with me.

35:35.120 --> 35:38.039
Great ships sail out
of Dublin and Liverpool,

35:38.040 --> 35:40.559
but a woman dare
not travel alone. No.

35:40.560 --> 35:44.048
You're brave. You shoot men.
You step on their necks.

35:44.320 --> 35:48.286
When I saw that, I realized you
could be very useful to me.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.399
Useful, could I?

35:50.400 --> 35:52.284
Yes.
You could be my serving boy.

35:53.480 --> 35:54.920
I see.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.447
I see, I could
polish your boots for you.

36:00.400 --> 36:01.559
They will need
a polish now and then.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.886
Aye.

36:03.000 --> 36:07.125
Aye, they would, and I could
make you a cup of tea.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.843
When teatime calls for it.
Yes.

36:09.920 --> 36:12.919
I'll throw the tea in your
face and piss on your boots

36:12.920 --> 36:14.639
before I serve the likes of you.

36:14.640 --> 36:15.879
Get out.
No.

36:15.880 --> 36:16.919
I'll pay you threepence a day.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.121
Get out!

36:18.520 --> 36:21.919
I've an appointment in the morning
and I'm going to honor it.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.999
You'll never win
this duel with Stephen.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.839
We've all seen you handle a gun.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.769
Boy, I am giving you your freedom.

36:28.240 --> 36:30.119
I'm not going to a distant world.

36:30.120 --> 36:33.051
I'm of Ireland and I'll
stay in Ireland till I die.

36:33.120 --> 36:35.368
That's in about five hours.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.404
These weapons belonged
to my father's father.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.281
His father's father was an ass.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.491
I've asked to serve as your
second in this barbarism.

37:11.640 --> 37:13.524
I appreciate that, sir.

37:14.240 --> 37:16.204
Choose one of those things.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.205
You had a good breakfast
this morning, did you?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.879
It was grand, sir.
Thank you.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.999
Good, good.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.124
Count away, 15 paces.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.959
One, two...

37:40.960 --> 37:42.924
This way, son.

37:43.640 --> 37:48.084
Fog! My life is one
long mollifying fog.

37:48.840 --> 37:51.239
The land I hold I inherited.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.649
It manages itself
with a foggy logic of its own.

37:54.680 --> 37:58.327
Son, I was up thinking
about you all night long.

37:59.400 --> 38:02.119
I knew nothing of your family
or their eviction.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.679
I'm sorry for their pain.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.439
I understand why
you came to murder me.

38:05.440 --> 38:06.519
Thirteen...

38:06.520 --> 38:07.839
And I don't blame you
for it at all.

38:07.840 --> 38:09.039
Fourteen...

38:09.040 --> 38:10.401
Fifteen!

38:10.680 --> 38:13.406
Turn, each man, and fire!

38:20.400 --> 38:22.284
I can't see anything!

38:23.160 --> 38:24.771
I can!

38:27.760 --> 38:30.119
Boy, boy, come away from there.

38:30.120 --> 38:32.079
Shannon, get out of the way.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.759
Assess your stupidity, lad.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.610
Get away from me, woman.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.371
As you wish.

38:43.840 --> 38:45.079
Wait!

38:45.080 --> 38:47.044
Shannon!
Wait!

38:47.920 --> 38:49.121
Shannon!

38:50.560 --> 38:53.759
Shannon!
Shannon, don't!

38:53.760 --> 38:54.919
Goodbye, Stephen!

38:54.920 --> 38:56.201
Goodbye?

38:56.400 --> 38:57.886
Don't shoot!

38:58.040 --> 38:59.759
No! No! No!

38:59.760 --> 39:01.199
Shannon!
Shannon!

39:02.440 --> 39:06.804
Shannon! Don't!
No!

39:07.120 --> 39:09.641
I saved your neck.
You remember that.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.079
Thank you, boy.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.691
Don't call me boy.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.326
Sugar.

39:50.640 --> 39:51.841
Two.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.679
You might display some gratitude

40:01.680 --> 40:04.119
considering the price I paid
for your passage.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.687
I paid, let me remind you.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.079
Good afternoon.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.319
Forgive me if I'm intruding.

40:14.320 --> 40:17.759
But I wonder if you'd enjoy a
gentle stroll around the deck.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.839
She's drinking her tea now.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.963
There's no need to
state the obvious, boy.

40:23.000 --> 40:26.039
My name's McGuire
from Boston, Massachusetts.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.999
You're American?

40:30.000 --> 40:33.959
Irish-born, I went back
for personal reasons.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.891
A stroll would be delightful,
Mr. McGuire.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.006
Parasol.

40:43.520 --> 40:48.239
In my imagination, America is
a wonderfully modern place.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.479
Am I right?

40:49.480 --> 40:50.639
Modern as modern can be.

40:50.640 --> 40:53.079
The people, the
culture, the industry.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.359
What about the land?

40:54.360 --> 40:55.721
I beg your pardon?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.879
Land. This girl's
got it in her head

40:57.880 --> 40:59.759
they're giving land away for free.

40:59.760 --> 41:03.442
That's true. Oklahoma territory.
The West's opening up.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.919
I told you, boy.

41:04.920 --> 41:06.360
Can't be good land.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.519
It's the finest in the world.
Seeds flourish in it.

41:09.520 --> 41:12.326
The cattle that grow upon it
are fat as elephants.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.919
How do you get it, Mr. McGuire?

41:13.920 --> 41:15.399
Is it there when
you step off the boat?

41:15.400 --> 41:17.799
No. You have to
travel 1,000 miles or so.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.959
When you get there, you'll have
to run for the land in a race.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.446
A race?

41:22.640 --> 41:24.683
Don't lose time in Boston.

41:24.880 --> 41:28.129
As soon as you can, purchase
horses, a wagon and supplies.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.765
Have I upset you?

41:34.080 --> 41:36.282
I didn't expect it
to be so complicated.

41:36.480 --> 41:40.287
We're very fortunate. Any difficulty
can be overcome with money.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.802
Excuse me, I'd like to speak
to Mr. McGuire alone.

41:52.120 --> 41:56.484
Mr. McGuire, I do have money,
but it's in the form of spoons.

41:56.520 --> 41:57.759
Spoons?

41:57.760 --> 41:59.724
Ancient spoons made of silver.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.759
I'd planned to sell them
when I arrived in Boston.

42:02.760 --> 42:06.362
I can recommend a couple of shops
that'll treat you honestly.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.759
I'm very much obliged to you, sir.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.610
Pleasure's mine.

42:10.760 --> 42:12.291
Thank you.

42:17.280 --> 42:20.484
May I ask what you are doing
sitting at my table?

42:20.640 --> 42:22.649
I'm eating your chocolate cake.

42:24.360 --> 42:28.007
I see. And what have you done
with my father's necktie?

42:29.760 --> 42:33.248
I flung it into the sea.
It was gagging my throat.

42:34.480 --> 42:36.519
You're just upset
because everything

42:36.520 --> 42:38.961
I told you about is
turning out to be true.

42:40.360 --> 42:44.929
"Cows as fat as elephants."
I know what that man's after.

42:48.640 --> 42:51.081
I think you should
cover your ankles.

43:07.840 --> 43:11.362
America.
I'm here, I've made it.

43:12.920 --> 43:14.724
I've arrived, Joseph.

43:19.800 --> 43:21.604
Beg your pardon.

43:25.800 --> 43:29.561
United States of America flag.
You're an American today.

43:32.240 --> 43:35.250
Your great friend,
Mr. McGuire, has vanished.

43:35.600 --> 43:37.359
for one American dollar?

43:37.360 --> 43:39.801
There he is!
Mr. McGuire!

43:42.120 --> 43:43.606
Over here!

43:43.960 --> 43:47.164
Mr. McGuire!
Mr. McGuire!

43:47.680 --> 43:49.291
There you are.

43:50.800 --> 43:53.519
Hey, mister, you Irish?
I can take you to the ward boss.

43:53.520 --> 43:56.799
Need work? Need lodging? There's
people that hate you if you're Irish.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.559
You can't get nothing
without the ward boss.

43:58.560 --> 44:00.239
He's the biggest man in Boston.

44:00.240 --> 44:02.647
Go fleece somebody else, boy.

44:02.840 --> 44:06.079
I know the games of these shysters.
Come on, Miss Christie.

44:06.080 --> 44:08.442
I'll find you a suitable hotel.

44:08.840 --> 44:10.439
Cab!

44:10.440 --> 44:12.085
Thank goodness for Mr. McGuire.

44:13.520 --> 44:16.121
Take Miss Christie
here to a decent hotel.

44:20.560 --> 44:24.446
Well, you've certainly upheld
your end of the bargain.

44:25.400 --> 44:27.090
Good luck, Shannon.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.971
Good luck, Joseph.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.770
Hey, McGuire.

44:49.160 --> 44:50.359
Yes?

44:50.360 --> 44:51.607
Welcome back.

44:53.080 --> 44:54.611
Oh, my God!

44:57.080 --> 45:01.001
Oh, my God! My spoons, my spoons.
They're taking my spoons.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.484
Joseph, Mr. McGuire
stole my spoons.

45:04.600 --> 45:07.929
No, please! Those are mine.
He stole them from me.

45:08.160 --> 45:11.967
Joseph! Please. Joseph, that
dead man, he stole my spoons.

45:12.080 --> 45:14.681
My bag.
They're taking everything.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.839
Now I have nothing.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.439
Come away, Shannon, we have to go.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.399
I have nothing now.
I have no money.

45:31.760 --> 45:34.319
God is punishing me, Joseph.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.559
I stole those spoons from my
mother the morning I ran away.

45:37.560 --> 45:40.279
Hey, you!
You! Stand still!

45:40.280 --> 45:41.999
I didn't do nothing.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.770
Who's this man, the ward boss?

45:49.520 --> 45:51.919
That's him there,
fighting in the fancy clothes.

45:51.920 --> 45:54.009
Mike Kelly, his name is.

46:00.840 --> 46:03.159
Shannon, you should
stand back over there.

46:03.160 --> 46:06.204
Don't shield me, Joseph.
It's only a boxing match.

46:07.560 --> 46:08.761
What?

46:12.920 --> 46:14.519
I'm sorry, Mike.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.882
Mike isn't happy when he loses.

46:32.600 --> 46:35.371
You distracted me.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.168
You weren't concentrating.

46:43.080 --> 46:45.203
A scrappy Connemara man?

46:45.840 --> 46:47.644
Fresh off the boat?

46:51.000 --> 46:52.406
Follow me.

46:53.800 --> 46:56.559
Not you, woman.
You just cost me part of a tooth.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.079
If he gets to go, then I get to go.

46:58.080 --> 46:59.725
I'm Mike Kelly.

46:59.800 --> 47:02.890
Who is this bit of a
snip anyway, your wife?

47:03.120 --> 47:04.719
Certainly not.

47:04.720 --> 47:06.279
Then who are you
coming into my club?

47:06.280 --> 47:08.005
She's...
I'm...

47:08.320 --> 47:09.760
My sister.

47:11.360 --> 47:13.679
Tell me she isn't
a pain in the ass.

47:13.680 --> 47:16.679
Sister? Our blood's not even
the same temperature.

47:16.680 --> 47:17.881
Shannon.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.603
These people, Shannon,
are my kind of people.

47:24.520 --> 47:27.530
And my kind doesn't like your kind.

47:29.760 --> 47:32.645
In fact, they hate
everything about you.

47:39.440 --> 47:44.009
Now, for some reason or other,
I'm willing to lie for you.

47:45.120 --> 47:48.319
Or we could tell them you're a
rich Protestant. Might be sporting.

47:48.320 --> 47:50.010
No, Joseph.

47:51.880 --> 47:53.161
My brother.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.646
Good.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.279
What do you call yourself?

48:05.280 --> 48:06.799
Joseph Donnelly.

48:06.800 --> 48:09.526
Well, Donnelly, let's put you
on the road to citizenship.

48:09.800 --> 48:13.800
We'll get you working and get
you voting when the time comes.

48:14.680 --> 48:17.008
See how the system works here, lad?

48:17.600 --> 48:19.006
Yeah.

48:19.360 --> 48:20.721
Stop it.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.959
Don't.
Leave me alone.

48:24.040 --> 48:26.686
Get away or I'll claw your eyes out.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.648
Don't. No.
I said, leave me alone.

48:31.080 --> 48:33.282
Excuse me, Mr. Kelly.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.759
Leave me alone.
I won't ask you again.

48:36.840 --> 48:39.281
No. Get away!

48:42.520 --> 48:45.200
I'll ask you to
leave this lady alone.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.330
Go ahead and ask.

48:52.920 --> 48:54.884
I've no wish to fight you.

48:55.160 --> 48:57.408
He's no wish to fight me...

48:57.720 --> 48:59.365
All right, hold him.

48:59.680 --> 49:02.360
No, he's mine.
He's mine alone.

49:07.760 --> 49:09.530
Get him, Joseph!

49:25.200 --> 49:26.811
Okay, okay.

49:33.040 --> 49:34.241
Well, now.

49:35.320 --> 49:36.959
You knocked the piss out of the man

49:36.960 --> 49:38.764
who knocked the piss out of me.

49:38.880 --> 49:41.242
I'm not sure how I feel about that.

49:41.960 --> 49:43.919
Dermody.
Yes, sir, Mr. Kelly.

49:43.920 --> 49:48.284
Time to make the rounds. We'll take
this scrapper and the girl here

49:48.640 --> 49:50.763
and lodge them at Molly Kay's.

49:51.000 --> 49:53.009
Grab the luggage.
Yes, sir.

49:54.320 --> 49:55.885
Come on.

49:57.520 --> 50:01.281
Pete, get a match going these
fellas can bet on, will you? I'll be back.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.359
Hey, Mike, what the hell you doing?

50:04.360 --> 50:06.959
All depends.
Good to see you, lads.

50:06.960 --> 50:08.159
This is it, here we are.

50:08.160 --> 50:10.400
Good day to you, Mr. Kelly.
How are you, man?

50:12.560 --> 50:13.599
Molly!

50:13.600 --> 50:16.119
It's just as unpleasant
for me as it is for you.

50:16.120 --> 50:19.039
Got a brother and sister,
Molly, need a room.

50:19.040 --> 50:22.119
You're in luck. We had a
suicide just this morning.

50:26.000 --> 50:27.239
How are you, Bridget?

50:27.240 --> 50:28.521
Hello, Mike.

50:29.280 --> 50:30.839
Any gentlemen up here, girls?

50:30.840 --> 50:32.451
No.

50:32.600 --> 50:34.839
Make an announcement, Dermody.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.119
Ward boss!
Ward boss!

50:37.120 --> 50:38.679
I give you another year.

50:38.680 --> 50:40.159
You're not campaigning, Mike.

50:40.160 --> 50:42.879
Relax, Molly. Politics is more
important to these men than sex.

50:42.880 --> 50:44.359
And I'm the Virgin Mary.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.959
God forgive you, Molly.

50:45.960 --> 50:48.128
Not likely, Mike.
Come on.

50:49.040 --> 50:52.719
Is that Jimmy Dunne, I see? I was
chatting with your wife today, Jimmy.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.843
Don't tell me wife, Mike.

50:54.960 --> 50:58.199
And here is the bath, but
don't linger in it too long.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.528
It's the only one in the house.

51:08.480 --> 51:10.489
This is your room here.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.920
Ours?

51:15.000 --> 51:17.806
You're not suggesting
that we share this room?

51:18.320 --> 51:22.809
I don't care what you do in it
as long as you pay me $1 a week.

51:24.760 --> 51:26.999
There must be some mistake.
We need two rooms.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.519
I've only got the one.

51:28.520 --> 51:29.679
Well, that's not good enough.

51:29.680 --> 51:30.879
Mike, what have you sent me?

51:30.880 --> 51:32.119
You're not listening!

51:32.120 --> 51:36.405
Shannon! Molly, the room is fine.
We'll take it gratefully.

51:40.720 --> 51:43.161
Your sister was spoilt, I'd say.

52:25.240 --> 52:29.001
Shannon?
Shannon, are you awake?

52:30.080 --> 52:31.884
No, sound asleep.

52:33.080 --> 52:35.567
I think I like America.

52:37.240 --> 52:39.408
Do you now?
Aye.

52:40.640 --> 52:44.162
We've only been here a day.
Look at the welcome we've got.

52:44.440 --> 52:46.802
Would you like a room?
Here you go.

52:47.360 --> 52:50.530
Would you like a job?
Why, here you go.

52:51.400 --> 52:56.128
How about some land?
Well, get a horse and help yourself.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.090
So, now you believe me
about the land, do you?

53:00.600 --> 53:04.043
If they're throwing it away,
I wouldn't mind a piece of it.

53:10.280 --> 53:13.404
Maybe this is my destiny.

53:15.120 --> 53:17.599
On his deathbed, my father told me

53:17.600 --> 53:19.768
he'd be watching me from up above.

53:21.440 --> 53:25.247
I wonder now if his spirit might
be near, guiding me along.

53:25.600 --> 53:27.719
If he bumps into
Mr. McGuire up there,

53:27.720 --> 53:29.763
tell him I want my spoons back.

53:30.120 --> 53:31.651
Imagine me,

53:32.280 --> 53:35.404
Joseph Donnelly, standing
on my own plot of land.

53:37.760 --> 53:40.247
What would I plant, I wonder, what?

53:40.600 --> 53:42.723
Oats? Corn?

53:43.160 --> 53:46.603
Potatoes?
God, no, not potatoes.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.851
Maybe wheat.

53:49.760 --> 53:51.086
Wheat.

53:52.600 --> 53:56.566
Shannon, I'm dreaming of it now.

53:57.480 --> 54:00.650
Great fields of wheat
as far as the eye can see.

54:01.240 --> 54:04.842
Oklahoma land was my idea,
you blathering fool!

54:05.400 --> 54:07.479
"Maybe this is my destiny."

54:07.480 --> 54:10.889
If it weren't for me, farm boy,
you wouldn't even be here.

54:11.000 --> 54:15.524
If it weren't for me, Miss High and
Mighty, you'd have died in the street!

54:20.800 --> 54:22.604
Give me back my pillow.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.009
Not in 100 years.

54:43.960 --> 54:46.162
This book is irritating me.

55:04.040 --> 55:06.971
Do you actually think
you're fooling me, Daniel?

55:12.880 --> 55:16.721
Would you prefer I proclaim my
independence and drink in the open?

55:16.840 --> 55:18.280
No.

55:19.720 --> 55:21.729
I like the system we've got.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.804
How can she be so cruel?

55:29.000 --> 55:31.202
Not to send us any word.

55:36.040 --> 55:37.651
She's in America, Nora.

55:44.600 --> 55:47.531
She's been writing to me
for some time now.

55:52.480 --> 55:54.648
You hid these from me?

55:56.160 --> 55:58.089
At Shannon's request.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.245
Read them now,

56:01.920 --> 56:04.691
though they may not
bring you comfort.

56:10.960 --> 56:12.161
Nora!

56:14.600 --> 56:15.801
Nora!

56:15.880 --> 56:17.359
Death to the landlord.

56:17.360 --> 56:19.005
Burn the house to the ground.

56:19.280 --> 56:20.839
Burn it down.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.089
Captain Moonlight.

56:30.800 --> 56:32.599
Get out of the house, Nora!

56:32.600 --> 56:34.319
The letters.

56:34.320 --> 56:35.959
Leave the letters alone, Nora.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.161
My baby!

56:45.960 --> 56:47.650
Come with me.

56:48.120 --> 56:50.448
Stephen, we're over here.

56:50.520 --> 56:52.529
Quickly, come this way.

57:16.800 --> 57:19.731
All of your life
collected and destroyed.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.962
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

57:29.840 --> 57:31.279
Does this mean we're finished?

57:31.280 --> 57:33.799
Are we impoverished now?

57:33.800 --> 57:34.999
No, sir.

57:35.000 --> 57:37.646
You still have your land
and your holdings.

57:46.280 --> 57:49.450
This is no longer
the Ireland of my birth.

57:54.520 --> 57:58.039
Our daughter's fallen into perilous
ruin, Daniel. We must go to her now.

57:58.040 --> 57:59.446
Shannon?

58:06.080 --> 58:08.965
She's been in Boston
these many months.

58:13.680 --> 58:15.848
Then we shall find her there.

58:16.280 --> 58:18.639
You over there, keep working.

58:18.640 --> 58:22.890
You don't work, you don't get paid.
Get those chickens plucked.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.731
Get to work.

58:42.120 --> 58:44.399
I think the prettiest
girl in this factory

58:44.400 --> 58:48.571
with the prettiest eyes and the
prettiest red hair is Joseph's sister.

58:48.640 --> 58:50.479
If you don't mind
me saying so, Joseph.

58:50.480 --> 58:52.409
Say what you like, lad.

58:52.760 --> 58:56.521
But I warn you, that redhead
has a bite that stings.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.325
Get to work.

59:01.680 --> 59:04.486
Get your filthy hands
off me, you ugly animal.

59:08.640 --> 59:10.763
That'll cost you a day's wage.

59:14.560 --> 59:17.570
Go ahead.
Insult me again.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.679
Pig.

59:30.400 --> 59:32.329
There goes tomorrow.

59:33.760 --> 59:35.086
Done?

59:47.320 --> 59:51.127
Take Friday as well, you spineless
little fraction of a man.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.963
Bite, lads. Bite!

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.804
What are you looking at?

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.408
I'm just trying to figure out
what you're doing there.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.279
It's obvious what I'm doing,
I'm cleaning my clothes.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.527
I see.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.810
Do you ever wonder why it
takes you so long, Shannon?

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.839
My clothes, if you notice,
if you look about,

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.283
are washed and hung.
Done.

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:44.527
Your talent astounds me, Joseph.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:49.644
Move over.
Move over.

01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:53.359
If you want to clean your clothes,

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.799
you have to get your hands wet.

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.651
First, you place the board like so.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:02.924
You take the soap in your right
hand, the clothes in the left.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:06.369
You brush the soap across
the clothes twice. Like so.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.691
Then you plunge and scrub.
You plunge and scrub.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:16.199
Plunge and scrub
and plunge and scrub.

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.562
And plunge and scrub and lift.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:23.801
And if it's still not clean,
then you go again.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.279
You plunge and scrub.
You plunge and scrub.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.759
You keep plunging and scrubbing

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.170
till all your plunging
and scrubbing is done.

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:49.001
Thirty, 40, 45, 50.

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.965
You could be a banker, Joseph,
with your ability to count.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.685
A compliment.

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.330
Thank you, Shannon.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.759
Don't suppose you've calculated
what the journey will cost.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:06.442
If I barter, I can get a
buckboard for under $25.

01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:08.683
It's the harness that's costly.

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.924
Bit, frame...

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:17.841
Frame, collar, reins.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.890
Very impressive.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.522
How much have you saved, Shannon?

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.639
Are you still praying you'll make
it to the Oklahoma land race?

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.119
I'll get there.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:32.685
What a corker.

01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:36.164
You're a corker, Shannon.

01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.519
Why don't you go back to Ireland?
Write your parents for money.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.724
They'll forgive you
for your petty foolishness.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.123
America may not be exactly
what I thought it would be.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.851
But if I went back
to Ireland, I wouldn't...

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.321
What?

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.285
Wouldn't what?

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.839
I said I'll get there and
I'll get there. By myself.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:04.199
You'll need supplies.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.519
Of course.
Food, clothes.

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.245
Ammunition, gun.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.003
Whenever I think of guns,
I remember Stephen Chase.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.811
You're lucky to be rid
of that piss-headed snob.

01:03:19.240 --> 01:03:22.967
He wasn't so bad, Joseph.
You didn't know him as well as I did.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.684
I knew him well enough.

01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.444
Me, he adored.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.684
He worshiped me.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.639
There wasn't a puddle of mud

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:36.049
he didn't lay his coat upon
for me to walk across.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.330
Are you facing east?

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.125
I'm facing east.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.486
All right.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.565
Almost ready.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.804
Thanks be to Jesus.

01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:03.246
Light!

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.326
I'm in.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.010
Good night, Shannon.

01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:40.606
Joseph?

01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:43.206
What?

01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.249
Am I beautiful at all?

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:09.450
I've never seen anything like
you in all my living life.

01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:12.847
Good.

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.159
Let's have another boxing
match. We need another challenger.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.759
This man has not
been defeated tonight.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.405
Will anyone box him?

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:46.199
Any challengers? You, sir, you can
beat him. You got the face of a winner.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.970
I'll fight him!

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.241
Joseph!

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.679
No! No. Joseph,
there's rules in this club.

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.441
Toe the line and all that. You got
to wait till I signal, Joseph.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.159
Toe the line, gentlemen!

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.523
No kicking, no biting, no gouging!

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.724
You're facing the wrong way!

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:16.919
Fight me here, farmer!

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.929
Your foot on the line.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.886
Right.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.323
Toe the line. Toe the line.
Get away.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.688
Come on, you're yella!

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.321
Come on!

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.450
Come on, scrapper.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.168
Stop it.
You won, Joseph. Stop it.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.129
What a fight.
I knew you had it in you.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.881
Girls, next up, the burleycue.

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.879
What do you call yourself again?

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.079
Joseph Donnelly.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:10.841
That's right. Joseph Donnelly. You
clobbered that fella's brains out.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.168
I discovered this fella,
fresh off the boat.

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:18.244
Gordon, get this scrapper
something to smoke.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:24.368
Who's your boy there, Kelly?

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.369
A new-fangled style
of fighting he's got.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.119
He's slippery, all right.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.484
Joseph, shake hands with Mr. D'Arcy
Bourke, member of the City Council.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.559
I'll shake your hand, Mr. Bourke,

01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:38.240
but I'm not in a friendly mood.
I came here to fight.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:40.239
There's fight left in me yet.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.090
He's a lively one, Kelly.

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:45.926
Would you box an Italian
if I scared one up?

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.679
I'll box any man
you put in front of me.

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.439
Mike, Mike, Mike!

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:54.519
Jesus Christ, Dermody, when's
your voice gonna change?

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.679
We've got another pug, Mike.
Bring him on.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.319
And I'll put money on you.

01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:00.761
Place your bets, gentlemen.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.088
The boy's got an appetite, Kelly.

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.999
Toe the line, gentlemen.
Joseph.

01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:27.446
It's nothing.
I'm feeling grand tonight.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:31.328
Steady now, you rogue.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.321
Joseph.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.639
Oh, my God, what happened?

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.410
Help me get him into bed.

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:43.131
Joseph, you're covered in blood.
What happened to you?

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:46.729
He's been prizefighting,
but he'll survive.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:51.042
He had a charge of gunpowder
in him that needed to go off.

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.044
And who might you be?

01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.240
I'm Grace.
I work at the Social Club.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.246
I did well tonight, didn't I?

01:09:01.359 --> 01:09:03.562
You beat them all, Joseph.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.370
But don't talk now.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.290
Get some sleep.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.849
I need to talk to you.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.841
You're his sister, right?

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:30.080
What sort of man is he? Besides
tough and handsome as a devil.

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:32.250
He's extremely moody.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:37.970
I believe that. Full of spit, isn't he?
And passion?

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:42.368
No, not really, no.
He's fairly dull.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.884
Dull? I don't know what
sort of men you're used to,

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.122
but he's anything but dull.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:54.839
And the build on him.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.279
Me and the girls got swollen
eyes from gawking at his bum.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.999
Goodbye, Grace.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.319
Would you tell him I...

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.599
Nice to meet you.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.799
I just want...

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.047
Good night, Grace.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:09.251
That was Grace.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.799
So she said.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.799
She dances in the burleycue.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.279
Yes, well, never mind her now.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.639
Just lay there.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:18.649
No, Joseph, lie still.
Lie still.

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.122
Look in my boot down there.

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:31.399
$4. That's more than plucking
chickens in a month.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.525
I'll have my horse-and-buggy
money before the winter comes,

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.759
and it won't be
from plucking chickens.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.759
There are other ways to
get to Oklahoma, Joseph.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.521
You should have heard them,
Shannon, cheering me on.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.250
It was grand.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.239
Toe the line, gentlemen.

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.806
Too slow.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.199
You come to the body,
you come to the face.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.439
And you move out of the way.

01:11:56.440 --> 01:11:57.919
When he's coming around,
you get out of the way.

01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.724
They just stand there,
look at them.

01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:40.642
Come on! Come on!
Come on now!

01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:53.279
Hello there, Joseph.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.559
Hello, Cara.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.842
All done up like a gentleman.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.919
How do you do, ladies?

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.848
Shannon.
Joseph.

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.119
He's a handsome catch,
that Joseph Donnelly is.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.159
If he can keep his
knuckles up all night,

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:16.119
imagine what his willie can do.

01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:25.686
Shoes, secondhand shoes, madam.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.049
Would you look at that!

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.999
Look at the sleeves
all billowed out.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.999
From Paris, France, it says.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.089
So beautiful and modern.

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.930
Excuse me!

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.679
Well, excuse me.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:46.247
Even her poodle's putting on airs.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.451
Look, Shannon,
there's your famous brother.

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:53.804
Good grief, he's bought
himself another hat.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.239
See you tomorrow.
Bye.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:57.521
Bye, Olive.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.399
Hello, Shannon.

01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.647
Hello, Joseph.

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.846
What do you think?
Do you like it?

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.601
Like my hat?

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.368
No. Not at all.

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.243
I'll get some other opinions.

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.119
Do you like my hat?

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:20.959
It's a fine hat, Mr. Donnelly,

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.599
and a fine fight
last night as well.

01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:24.404
Glad you enjoyed it, Connor.

01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:28.519
So I left her there
pulling up her knickers.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:31.764
Hold on a second.
Here he comes.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.119
There's my boy,
looking fit and dandy.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.399
How are you, scrapper?

01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:37.559
Never better, Mike.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.999
Hello, lads.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:40.399
Mr. Bourke would
like a word with you.

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.444
Joseph Donnelly, still undefeated.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.879
He's a rascal of a holy terror.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:48.128
That he is.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:56.322
That's a long-legged
piece of strawberry tart.

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.890
Mind your mouth, Mr. Bourke.

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.124
Now, Donnelly, you don't
talk to Mr. Bourke that way.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.965
Let it go, Kelly.

01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:12.202
This is business and the
boy's our stock in trade.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.439
Now, listen to me, lad. There's
a man I want you to box.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.087
He's a goddamn Italian and I
want you to spill his blood.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.287
I'll box and I'll win.

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:26.527
But your boys don't
own me, Mr. Bourke.

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.809
I box for myself, alone.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.642
What do you think you're doing
pissing against the wind?

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:40.999
D'Arcy Bourke is a
powerful man in Boston,

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:42.719
a man whose connections I need.

01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.799
I'm not gonna kiss
the back of his trousers

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:46.923
just 'cause the rest of you do.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.764
You like your suit?

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.051
Well, do you?

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.359
You like having
a roof over your head?

01:15:55.360 --> 01:15:57.759
I'm your bread and butter, lad.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.399
Cross me and you're nothing,

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.682
nothing but an ignorant mick.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:05.799
You do what you're told or I'll
throw you out in the street,

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:09.641
and every door you knock on
will be slammed in your face.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.765
Do you understand?

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.521
Aye.

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.041
Good.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.999
It's gonna be a grand
fight, Mr. Bourke.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.521
Good, that's what I like to hear.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.486
Shannon?

01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.689
I'm drunk, Joseph.

01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.799
How can you be drunk?
You just left my sight.

01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:50.844
She's working her way
through a jigger of rye.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.239
When I finish it, I may or
may not have another one.

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.279
Well, Shannon, you came
to America to be modern.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.562
I'm glad everything's working out.

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:12.039
You have changed, Mr. Donnelly.

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:14.083
Improved, you mean.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.879
Nope. Changed.

01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:19.128
Look at all those silly hats.

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:22.559
You'll never get to Oklahoma.
You've spent all your money.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.679
At the rate I'm going,
they'll bring the land to me.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.928
You have turned into a snob.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:30.641
Joseph?

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.725
Joseph!

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.647
Excuse me, drunkard.

01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.359
Hello, Grace.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:50.963
Hello, Joseph, will I be seeing
you in church tomorrow morn?

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.766
Sounds divine and holy, Grace.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.799
We can share a pew, me and you.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:58.206
Toodle-oo.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.006
Same to you.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:05.799
She's got an awfully large
chest to be going to church.

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:09.800
Shannon, all chests are equal
in the eyes of the Lord.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.599
She goes into the confession box,

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.723
she'll never come out,
the little tramp.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:19.245
Grace isn't a tramp. She's
a dancer in the burleycue.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:23.329
That isn't dancing. That's
kicking her knickers up.

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.968
I suspect if you asked her to,
she'd kick her knickers off.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.284
Maybe she would.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.119
Has she?

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.129
Let me see.
Has she?

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.005
I'm trying to remember.

01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:40.001
Think hard. If there's any
brain left in your head.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.841
Look at you. They're making a fool of
you, the ward boss and his friends.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.959
They respect me.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.288
They do not.
They don't respect you.

01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.519
Enough.

01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.959
You're money in their pockets
and nothing more, Joseph.

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:54.479
I said that's enough, Shannon.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.479
You let them pickle you
like a piece of pork.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:58.279
They're just using you.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.999
I said, that's enough out of you.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.648
No, put me down!

01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.479
No! No!

01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.209
Tell me.
Tell me you like my hat.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:14.119
You're not wearing a hat.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:15.679
Say it. Say you like my hat.

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.159
You're not wearing a hat.

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.521
Say it.

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.039
Why can't you say it, Shannon?

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.719
Why can't you say you like my hat?

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:27.490
Why can't you say you like my suit?

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.885
I've earned this.

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.405
I've done well.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.969
Don't touch me, Joseph.

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.039
Why don't you go fondle that
slut with the runaway tits,

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.083
if she isn't stuffing
her face with pie.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.879
You're jealous of me. I made more
money than you and you're jealous.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.926
I can make money as fast as you can.
You just watch me, scrapper.

01:20:08.520 --> 01:20:11.451
Shannon?
Shannon!

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.041
Shannon!

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.810
Why don't you shag her
and get it over with?

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:25.205
She's my sister.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:27.319
And I'm your mother.

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:34.919
Joseph!

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:36.679
Every time your gentleman leaves,

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.319
I want you to tidy your room,
do you hear me?

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:39.519
Molly?

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.599
I don't want to
have to say that again.

01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:41.719
Joseph, Mike Kelly's
looking for you.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:42.919
Molly, where's Shannon?

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:44.719
Tonight's the fight, the big fight.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.039
She didn't come home
from work today.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:47.399
The club is crawling with eyeties.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.639
Molly, have you seen her?

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:49.919
No, I have not.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.279
She's there.
Shannon is there.

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.641
Where?

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:59.046
Joseph,
show them how it's done, lad.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.529
Joseph, for Ireland!

01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:09.808
Shannon, stop this.

01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.799
Where's your dignity, woman?

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.604
You mind your business, Joseph.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.279
You get your brains smashed in
every night. What's the difference?

01:21:18.280 --> 01:21:20.119
There's a world of difference!

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.879
Come on, Donnelly, these eyeties
are tearing the place apart.

01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:23.959
Forget it!

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:25.639
Get in there and box. I've
got $100 bet on you tonight.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.039
Kiss it goodbye, Mr. Bourke.

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:29.519
I'll make it $200, and I'll
split the winnings with you.

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.324
$200,Joseph!

01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:32.799
What?

01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.319
Did you not hear me? I said I'll
split the winnings with you!

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.851
No.
Joseph.

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.600
Donnelly!

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:43.639
Take it.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.759
Take it?

01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:46.479
I thought you
didn't want me to fight.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.364
But it's so much money.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.371
You boxed for nickels before.
This is a fortune.

01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.485
Joseph! Joseph!

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.569
I'll match that offer.

01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:12.679
Don't let your stubborn
pride get in the way.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.679
You'll have it.
You'll have Oklahoma!

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.319
You'll never have to
fight for them again.

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:19.439
This'll get us out of here.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:27.721
Us?

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.291
Well, you.

01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.885
I mean you.

01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.489
Come on, let's show them.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:17.359
Joseph, damage the dago.
You hear me?

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.086
Keep back, will you?
Get back, come on.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.405
Come on, lad.

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.119
This is a fight to the finish,
gentlemen. A fight to the finish.

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:29.085
Side betting's allowed and a
knockdown terminates a round.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.642
Come to scratch, gentlemen.

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:02.689
Come on, scrapper!
Keep your left up.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:07.249
Yes! Go!

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:32.641
Joseph!

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.169
Kelly, I smell victory.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.809
I'd enjoy it even more
with a little strawberry tart.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:03.447
Mr. Bourke would like some company.

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:09.199
I'm not especially
attracted to Mr. Bourke.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:12.244
You came to me for help.
Let's show some manners.

01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:16.370
Come to scratch!
Come to scratch!

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.483
What the hell's he doing, Kelly?

01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:46.279
Get your hands off her.

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.679
There's too much
money at stake here.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:48.959
Filthy pig.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.479
Joseph! No!

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:53.763
Get back to scratch!
You wanna forfeit?

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.239
Shannon?

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:56.559
Put him down!

01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.279
Shannon!
Joseph!

01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.879
You're losing me money, you coward!

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.129
Get back in there and fight.
You're gonna forfeit.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:34.451
Move over.

01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.959
Go on, Joe, get up, Joe.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:50.808
Joseph!

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:02.679
No.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:04.120
Get up, Joseph.
Get up.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.039
Come on, get up. Get up!

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.925
I bet more money than you've got.
Get up!

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:13.010
Get up!
He's out.

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:40.239
Joseph.
My God, I'm sorry.

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:43.364
You, get off. Shut your mouth.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.207
Get this loser out of my club.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:55.371
Did you tell them we're in
Jefferson Court? Number 6 Jefferson Court.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.119
Make sure they hear you.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.279
In the south end.

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:01.563
Her family has come from Ireland.
They're here in Boston.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.963
They're offering a reward.

01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:13.922
Have you seen a girl like that?

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.599
Find her.
Do your job.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.599
Must I do everything for you?

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.319
We found her, and here
she is right over here.

01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:33.399
We'll never get anything out of
these people. They're drunks.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.809
If you see the girl, her
family is in Jefferson Court.

01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.322
Number 6 Jefferson Court.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.761
Joseph, what happened to you?

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.526
Shannon?

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:04.241
Shannon.

01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:07.769
Do come in, scrapper.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.886
That's our money.
We earned it.

01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:21.170
There isn't a penny here
doesn't originate with me.

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:23.725
Get him out.

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.245
Don't touch her.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:33.359
You're done, scrapper.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:36.439
You won't work here,
box here, nothing here.

01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:39.086
You coppers, beat it.
Get him up.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:44.243
Too bad, but I saw it coming the first
time you walked in off the boat.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:49.489
No. Leave him.

01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.445
No!

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:54.731
Leave...

01:30:55.040 --> 01:30:58.926
Molly Kay, these two are banished.

01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.281
You shelter them even a night,
I'll shut this whorehouse down.

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.081
Come on.

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:17.329
It's too cold, Joseph.

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.719
Hey!
Do you need help, sir?

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:23.359
Get out of here.

01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:25.679
We haven't eaten for three days.
I'll work for food.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:28.247
I don't hire Irish.

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:31.959
For the love of God, we
haven't eaten for three days.

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.164
I said I don't hire Irish.
Now, get out of here.

01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:53.887
Joseph, we can't keep
wandering like this.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.646
I know.

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:01.565
It's been so long, too many days.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.089
We can't keep doing this.

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.288
I think this house is empty.

01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.081
Look.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.201
A tree.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:34.161
Food.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:37.170
There's food here.

01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.849
Joseph, look at us.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.204
I never thought it
would turn out like this.

01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.481
Coming all this way for land.

01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:29.801
Shannon.

01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:33.920
Sit down.

01:33:35.080 --> 01:33:37.362
Sit down at this beautiful table.

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:40.451
No, we can't. We're burglars.

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:42.245
Please? Please.

01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:44.684
I want you to pretend.

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:47.723
Sit down.
I'll serve you.

01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.049
Tonight, I want you to dine.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.602
No, Joseph, don't serve me.
Just sit down.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.964
Sit down with me.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.884
Let's pretend

01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:33.562
that this house is ours.

01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:41.250
That you are my husband
and I'm your wife.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:48.801
Sit down.

01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:03.881
Joseph, did you ever wonder what that
land you dreamed of looked like?

01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.441
Aye.

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:14.041
Mine was a green pasture with tall
grass that rolled just a little bit.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.480
Mine had a stream
running through it.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.164
Perhaps some trees.

01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.528
Rich, dark soil.

01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:25.928
No rocks to pick out of the ground.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:30.048
A green pasture and a stream.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.127
They will complement
each other, no?

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:35.160
They would.

01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:42.048
The one, in fact,
depends upon the other.

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:45.566
Pretend

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.451
you love me.

01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:51.689
I pretend I love you.

01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:57.366
I pretend I love you, too.

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.483
What was that?
Who's there?

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:50.048
Get the hell out of my house.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.601
No!

01:36:58.400 --> 01:36:59.679
Shannon.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:01.166
Police. Police!

01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:03.519
Get the police!

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.601
Help!

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:26.124
Help! This girl needs help.
Will you let us in?

01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:37.370
Is this the Christie's?

01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.279
Shannon.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.925
Just let us in.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.879
Quickly, fetch a doctor.
Yes, sir.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:38:00.289
Step aside. You'll infect
her with your filthy hands.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:04.163
What did you expect? That you
could climb to her station?

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:06.841
A gunshot.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.205
God, look at her.

01:38:17.440 --> 01:38:18.999
Will she be all right?

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:20.690
She will now.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.245
The wound is in the shoulder.
I have to clean it.

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.680
Shannon, I...

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.565
You're safe now.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.411
This house.

01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.449
You're gonna be fine.

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:27.010
Take care of her.

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:50.279
Mr. Christie, Mr. Christie,
here's the doctor.

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.199
Something terrible has happened.

01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:53.359
What is it, Doctor?

01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.479
Your daughter, Mr. Christie.

01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.879
Shannon?
She's here?

01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:57.286
What's happened to her?

01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:34.999
She's all clear! Let's get
the mud cleaned out here.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.443
Hey, Mick, after you drop that tie
off, let's get after these rocks!

01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:42.289
Come on. Let's get some
goddamn work done here.

01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:44.365
Fill up that wheelbarrow!

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:31.725
<i>Move it.</i>

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.531
Fire in the hole.

01:41:37.080 --> 01:41:40.719
Come on, boys, find yourself some cover.
We got fire in the hole.

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:43.526
Hey, you, fire in the hole!

01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.206
Joseph.

01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:11.879
Joseph.

01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:27.846
Water!

01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:31.249
Anybody need water?

01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:33.446
Water?

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.570
Look at that. All them wagons
headed for the Oklahoma territory.

01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:44.959
I'd be going with them
if I was as young as you.

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:46.810
Doesn't interest me.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.084
I had a woman once.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.639
But she don't want me
'cause I had no money.

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:14.519
That's America. Unless you
are rich, you are nobody.

01:43:14.520 --> 01:43:17.326
I should never have
come to this place.

01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:22.809
Forget the women, boys. You got
a job of work ahead of you.

01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:49.367
<i>Da, is that you?</i>

01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:50.681
<i>Joseph!</i>

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.730
<i>You look like you're not
doing too well, my boy.</i>

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.045
<i>I missed you, Da.</i>

01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:03.171
<i>"A man is nothing
without land, " they say.</i>

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:09.881
Land is a man's own soul.

01:44:13.720 --> 01:44:16.002
<i>I'll work my own land someday.</i>

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:20.679
<i>If you manage it, by God,</i>

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:25.568
your old da will be smiling down
on you from heaven above.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.839
Stay where you are, boys.
We're just stopping for water.

01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:36.247
Look, it's the pioneers.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:43.561
No, they go to Oklahoma,
I think, for the free land.

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:50.326
They just wasting time. There
ain't enough land to go around.

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.999
One in 100 will stake a claim.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.522
The rest of them,
they just dreaming.

01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:02.966
Think they gonna
get some free land.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:14.531
Hey, Irish!

01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:18.479
Mick, where do you
think you're going?

01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:20.603
I was on the wrong road.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:37.041
There now!
Coming through!

01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:43.719
Farmers, ranchers, homesteaders,

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:45.759
this well driller is an example of

01:46:45.760 --> 01:46:47.719
modern American industry
at its finest.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:50.319
Come up and have a look.
It's not gonna bite you,

01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:51.519
it's just modern, that's all.

01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.119
You may find land tomorrow,

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.529
but you won't survive in the
wilderness, not without water.

01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:09.049
Folks, each quarter
section is marked.

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:14.203
You run for land, remove the marker
and drive in your own stake.

01:47:14.840 --> 01:47:17.566
The race begins tomorrow at noon.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.124
Again, each quarter
section is marked.

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.289
Where can I get a horse?

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:31.047
You're a little late, cowboy.
The pickings are slim.

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:36.081
Now, this here horse is broke.

01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:39.770
That horse there, green broke.

01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.204
Know the difference?

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:44.204
I think I can see it.

01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.924
A broke horse is
a dependable horse.

01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:53.169
A green broke horse, he's faster.

01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.446
That sounds good.
The faster the better.

01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:59.719
No telling what he'll do, though.

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.479
Hell, you could end up in Canada

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.364
on that green-broke son of a bitch.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.525
Stand back.

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:14.127
I think I'll take
the dependable horse.

01:48:14.640 --> 01:48:16.080
I would.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:17.519
You go out there and get you

01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:19.239
a good piece of land
tomorrow, now, Joseph.

01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.044
Thank you, Ralph.

01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.651
I'm cursed.

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.524
Oh, Lord, I'm cursed.

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:10.119
Mother, the clothes
will never come clean

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:12.243
if you don't get your hands wet.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.599
There's no order in
this godforsaken place.

01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.850
Here, take the soap
and you plunge and scrub.

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:22.879
Plunge and scrub?

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:24.206
Like so.

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:29.441
Nora? Nora! Nora!

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:31.799
I've been shot.

01:49:31.800 --> 01:49:33.161
Shot?

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:36.719
Well, shot at anyway.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:38.251
By the cavalry.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:41.763
We crossed the starting line
and we broke the law.

01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.879
Daniel Christie, I will not
have you riding tomorrow

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.287
in that vulgarity of a race!

01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:50.644
The Wild West suits me, Nora.

01:49:51.080 --> 01:49:53.726
There's no telling what I might do.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:59.011
Shannon!

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:03.839
Shannon, I found it.

01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:07.279
Twenty miles straight west of here.
It's paradise itself.

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:10.519
You will love it, Shannon. The
earth is dry and dusty here.

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:13.319
But where we'll live,
there's a winding stream,

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.491
and the grass on the gentle hills around
it grows high and rich and green.

01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:21.767
It's the plot of land
you've dreamed of.

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:26.365
Excuse me, Stephen.

01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:30.969
Are you cross with me, Shannon?

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:34.319
Of course I am. We were doing
this together, I thought.

01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:37.126
I couldn't take you with me today.
It was too dangerous.

01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:39.159
I don't mind a little
danger now and then.

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:41.089
Shannon, stop this childishness.

01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.879
Are we not here,
your parents and I,

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.399
amongst all these people
because you wanted this?

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:49.809
Tomorrow we'll ride as one,
together, side by side.

01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:54.085
We'll claim our land and then we'll
marry and finally settle down.

01:50:59.680 --> 01:51:02.531
You do want to settle down,
don't you, Shannon?

01:51:04.560 --> 01:51:05.761
Yes.

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.882
Yes, I want to settle down.

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.130
There now.
That's better.

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.449
I hate to see you angry.

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:23.562
It isn't your nature to be so.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:36.690
Hello, Shannon.

01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.167
I wondered if I'd see you here.

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.844
I suspected that I might.

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:00.447
Not I. I saw you living back
in Boston all this while.

01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:09.687
You look well.
You look well.

01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.644
I'm here with my family.

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:15.691
We came by train.

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:18.290
I came by train myself.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:22.999
You'll be running in the
race tomorrow, I presume.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.521
I always said I'd get my land.

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:29.171
I even bought a horse,
a fine horse.

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.401
Well.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:50.049
Time takes care of everything,
doesn't it, Joseph?

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:55.647
Everything's worked out
as it should have,

01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:58.686
don't you agree?

01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.446
Yeah.

01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:10.439
Good luck tomorrow, Joseph.

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.721
Aye.

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:15.528
Best of luck to you, Shannon.

01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:35.090
Shannon Christie?

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.604
You never gave up.

01:53:41.200 --> 01:53:44.051
You knew what you
wanted back in Ireland.

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.886
And look at you.
Here you are.

01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:55.248
You're a corker, Shannon.

01:53:57.080 --> 01:53:59.089
What a corker you are.

01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.641
Beautiful country, isn't it, boy?

01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:33.809
I found the perfect piece
of land for Shannon and me,

01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:38.086
almost the picture of what she
described. The land of her dreams.

01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:41.365
Congratulations.

01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:45.801
Just what the hell
are you doing here?

01:54:46.440 --> 01:54:49.679
You bring her to me bleeding, and
now you think you can talk to her?

01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:52.008
Stay away from her, do you hear me?

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:56.799
There'll be a lot of confusion
in the race tomorrow, lad.

01:54:56.800 --> 01:54:58.684
Someone could get shot.

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:32.250
<i>Her beautiful eyes</i>

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:36.159
<i>Were a terrible curse</i>

01:55:36.160 --> 01:55:39.569
<i>Three days in his grave</i>

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:43.129
<i>She ran off with his purse</i>

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:46.880
They've got their land
all picked out,

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:50.679
the pair of them.
The land of her dreams.

01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:55.681
All those months I was
trying to forget about her.

01:55:58.320 --> 01:56:01.569
I was laying down the very
track that brought her here.

01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.689
And to hell with everyone.
I'm gonna get my land.

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:14.247
That's my thought for the night.

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:17.889
Tomorrow I ride for me, me alone.

01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.771
And my horse.

01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:41.960
Sweet Mary Jesus

01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:44.886
and all the saints preserve us.

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:50.647
That there was the oldest
horse lever saw in my life.

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:51.999
It's almost noon. We're
gonna miss the photograph.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:53.964
All right.
You ready?

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.168
Stay with him, Joseph!

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.289
I sold him that horse.

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.801
Don't let him bluff you, cowboy!

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:25.728
We're breaking the law, Nora.

01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:28.679
I don't like you taking charge of
the business side of our life.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:31.167
You do, too.
Now listen up.

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:34.559
This stake goes into
the ground over there.

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.599
That's your job.
I'll tell you when.

01:58:36.600 --> 01:58:39.359
I, meanwhile, will run the
horse around in circles.

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:42.999
He's got to look all sweaty and
tired, even dead would be good.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.043
Got it?
Yes.

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:48.728
But we don't
really need all of this.

01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.039
It's scary out here, Daniel.

01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:53.685
We'll do fine.

01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:57.009
Pretend we're starting out in
life instead of ending up.

01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:20.367
You want to buy
a good pair of spurs?

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:24.566
Sorry.

01:59:28.760 --> 01:59:30.928
The race is that way, lad.

01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:48.639
Forget the horse, lad,
and find yourself a donkey.

01:59:53.640 --> 01:59:55.205
Joseph?

01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:59.164
Take him by the bit.

02:00:00.800 --> 02:00:02.161
Shannon?

02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:39.326
Hey, where the hell are you going?

02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:41.646
Shoot him!

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.009
Fire!

02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:54.405
That way!

02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:05.207
I've no wish to fight you.

02:03:57.880 --> 02:03:59.366
Go! Go!

02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.366
Lord, protect us.
Daniel, here they come.

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:47.639
Stand by, partner, and pretend
you're out of breath.

02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:51.208
Pretend? My heart's
up here in my nose!

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:57.199
Oh, my God, Nora!
This is thrilling.

02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:01.007
Nora? Now, Nora! Now!

02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:21.371
There it is.

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:25.209
Come on.
Come on.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.601
Come on, Shannon. Hurry.

02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.249
Come on!
Come on!

02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:09.807
Stephen! Stephen!

02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:14.370
Shannon, getup.
Grab the reins.

02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:25.169
Are you all right, Shannon?

02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:27.250
Are you all right?

02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:33.045
Go, Joseph. Go!

02:07:36.880 --> 02:07:38.399
Ride.

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.443
Go get your land.

02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:11.451
You're not in Ireland anymore,
you arrogant bastard!

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:17.324
Damn it, Shannon. Do you
want your land or don't you?

02:08:40.160 --> 02:08:41.850
This land is mine.

02:08:42.640 --> 02:08:44.763
Mine by destiny.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.479
Go ahead, Joseph!
Claim it!

02:09:15.480 --> 02:09:17.011
Shannon!

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.519
Claim it?

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:19.767
Stephen!

02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:22.249
Look out, Joseph!

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:37.289
No! Joseph!

02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.808
Oh, my God! Joseph!

02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.719
Joseph!
Shannon?

02:09:42.720 --> 02:09:44.679
Joseph.
Don't touch him.

02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:46.519
Get away, Stephen.
Shannon, listen to me.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:48.085
Get away, Stephen.
Shannon...

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.041
Leave!

02:09:52.080 --> 02:09:54.442
Joseph? Joseph.

02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:58.882
Joseph, look at me.
Look at me.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.567
No, don't move.
Stay still.

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:03.121
Shannon.

02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.765
Don't do this.

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.519
You've made your choice.

02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.768
Joseph, look at me.

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:22.481
Look at me.
Look at me.

02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:25.039
Joseph, look at me.

02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:27.079
I feel myself dying.

02:10:27.080 --> 02:10:30.079
No. No, you stay looking at my eyes.
Look at my eyes, Joseph.

02:10:30.080 --> 02:10:31.199
Shannon?

02:10:31.200 --> 02:10:32.239
No, you're not dying.

02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:35.046
Look!
You've got your land.

02:10:35.280 --> 02:10:39.121
But all the land in the world
means nothing to me without you.

02:10:39.760 --> 02:10:40.961
Joseph...

02:10:45.280 --> 02:10:47.687
I tried to prove myself to you,

02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:52.926
but I know nothing
of books or alphabets

02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:56.729
or sun or moon or...

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:00.091
All I know

02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:03.490
is Joseph loves Shannon.

02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:13.402
That's all that matters to me.

02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:22.799
Hey, Shannon.

02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:24.639
Joseph, Joseph, no.

02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:26.679
Shannon.

02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:28.848
No, no, stay with me.
Stay.

02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:30.765
Joseph, no!

02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.690
No. Joseph, look at me. Joseph!

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:39.160
Joseph, please.
Please don't leave me.

02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:41.728
Please don't leave me alone.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:46.646
Joseph, Joseph, no!

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:52.043
Joseph! Joseph, no!

02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:54.879
No!

02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:56.241
Please.

02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:01.051
No. Please come back, please.

02:12:01.200 --> 02:12:03.368
Don't leave me.

02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:11.762
This is our dream together.

02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:15.041
I don't want this without you.

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:25.571
I loved you.

02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.567
I loved you from the
first time I saw you.

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:44.961
I often wondered about that.

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:49.327
How? Joseph.

02:12:50.680 --> 02:12:53.559
You died.
You died!

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:56.201
Aye.

02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:03.086
You can be sure
I won't be dying twice.
