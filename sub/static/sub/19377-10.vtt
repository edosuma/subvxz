00:21.730 --> 00:24.608
<i>Open your eyes</i>
<i>This destiny</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:27.736
<i>If I can't escape it</i>

00:27.819 --> 00:29.488
<i>Then I'll swallow it all down</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:33.867
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And I'll fight</i>

00:33.951 --> 00:35.285
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:40.499 --> 00:43.502
<i>The menace that dominates</i>

00:43.585 --> 00:46.630
<i>The darkness in my troubled mind</i>

00:46.713 --> 00:49.800
<i>The truth of a human</i>

00:49.883 --> 00:52.803
<i>Who has begun to lose control</i>

00:52.886 --> 00:55.180
<i>That meaninglessness</i>

00:55.264 --> 00:58.642
<i>I've come to know it</i>

00:59.101 --> 01:01.645
<i>If even counterfeit peace</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:05.190
<i>Will break into pieces</i>

01:05.274 --> 01:09.736
<i>I will cast</i>

01:09.820 --> 01:16.618
<i>A defiant shadow</i>

01:17.452 --> 01:20.455
<i>It's the end of escape</i>
<i>Stand up</i>

01:20.539 --> 01:23.542
<i>Because it's the only way</i>

01:23.625 --> 01:29.756
<i>Follow it</i>
<i>The small hope I aim for</i>

01:29.840 --> 01:32.843
<i>The weakness that spilled</i>
<i>From the proffered hand</i>

01:32.926 --> 01:36.096
<i>I swallowed it all down</i>

01:36.179 --> 01:42.686
<i>Both right and wrong</i>
<i>And lost my mind</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:50.694
I WON'T DO IT

01:51.778 --> 01:54.281
<i>We're continuing our coverage</i>
<i>from the site of the attack.</i>

01:54.364 --> 01:56.158
<i>According to sources,</i>

01:56.241 --> 02:00.787
<i>Chairman Hashiguchi has been</i>
<i>assassinated by the Ajin Sato.</i>

02:00.871 --> 02:05.709
<i>Many AASF soldiers, along with a number</i>
<i>of riot police, were also killed.</i>

02:06.293 --> 02:10.047
<i>As for Sato, police are still not able</i>
<i>to follow his movements</i>

02:10.464 --> 02:13.759
<i>and have begun full-scale efforts</i>
<i>to track down his whereabouts.</i>

02:13.842 --> 02:16.428
<i>Sources say that pursuing Sato</i>
<i>is extremely difficult,</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:20.057
<i>due to the massive blackout that occurred</i>
<i>at the same time as the attacks.</i>

02:21.391 --> 02:24.353
Again with the funeral faces.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.198
What happened in there?!
Why did you let Sato get away?!

02:36.281 --> 02:37.908
Whoa, hold up, Mr. Tosaki!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.993
How did things go so wrong
with you there?!

02:40.577 --> 02:42.996
Your IBM should have crushed Sato!

02:43.330 --> 02:44.373
Am I wrong?!

02:44.956 --> 02:46.416
Say something!

02:46.500 --> 02:48.293
Mr. Tosaki, try to calm down.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.506
It's cruel to pin everything
that happened on Nagai.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.591
Suzumura's right.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.802
This isn't just Nagai's fault.

02:56.885 --> 02:57.761
Wrong.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.679
It is my fault.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.394
Not being able to stop Sato...

03:05.477 --> 03:07.437
Hirasawa and the others getting killed...

03:09.564 --> 03:10.982
It's all on me.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.737
Can I go now?

03:18.573 --> 03:19.950
Hey, Nagai!

03:20.784 --> 03:22.119
<i>That was live from the scene.</i>

03:22.786 --> 03:25.330
<i>The police are also seeking</i>
<i>the whereabouts</i>

03:25.414 --> 03:28.959
<i>of Yuu Tosaki and Izumi Shimomura</i>
<i>of the Ajin Control Commission.</i>

03:30.335 --> 03:31.378
Mr. Tosaki.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.339
Of course.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.092
Mr. Tosaki, what are you gonna do?

03:37.175 --> 03:39.177
Why are you such an idiot?

03:54.985 --> 03:56.862
There's nothing we can do.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.531
It's already over.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.241
Everything.

04:08.206 --> 04:12.043
Actually, I'm the biggest idiot here.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.629
Teaming up with Ajin...

04:15.338 --> 04:16.882
And this is what I end up with.

04:16.965 --> 04:21.344
Forget losing my job,
now I'm a criminal, too.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.072
<i>So?</i>

04:41.823 --> 04:44.743
<i>How does it feel,</i>
<i>seeing people die because of you?</i>

04:46.745 --> 04:49.039
Please... ghost... come on!

04:51.166 --> 04:53.293
Come on!

05:16.483 --> 05:18.026
You're sure of this?

05:18.693 --> 05:19.528
Yes, sir.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.197
It was all taken by Sato.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.451
Damn...
Tell the prime minister immediately.

05:34.042 --> 05:37.128
Prime minister,
if word of this matter gets out,

05:37.379 --> 05:39.548
the entire nation will fall into a panic.

05:40.423 --> 05:43.218
Is the threat that great?

05:43.927 --> 05:45.845
If they were to use everything
they've taken,

05:45.929 --> 05:49.182
it'd be possible to kill everyone
in the country three times over.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.896
Prime minister, you should keep in mind
the worst case scenario

05:54.980 --> 05:56.731
and prepare a settlement offer.

06:00.569 --> 06:01.444
I know.

06:02.320 --> 06:05.949
Have that taken care of
while we continue the search for Sato.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.200
Yes, sir.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.286
A NEW STATEMENT FROM SATO

06:09.411 --> 06:13.039
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>the countdown is over.</i>

06:13.665 --> 06:18.420
<i>But we never got a response</i>
<i>from the government.</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:21.590
<i>It's a big shame,</i>

06:22.132 --> 06:27.971
<i>but as I've said before,</i>
<i>we won't stop for anything.</i>

06:28.680 --> 06:30.640
<i>Therefore,</i>

06:31.224 --> 06:32.976
<i>within the next ten days,</i>

06:33.768 --> 06:35.562
<i>we will begin the final wave.</i>

06:36.688 --> 06:38.440
<i>And though you've made it this far,</i>

06:38.773 --> 06:42.277
<i>for those of you who still pretend</i>
<i>to have nothing to do with this,</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:46.531
<i>there's no escaping now.</i>

06:47.407 --> 06:49.200
<i>That was the Ajin Sato's...</i>

06:49.284 --> 06:51.244
How far are they going to go?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.496
This is insane.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.085
Three, two, one!

07:01.046 --> 07:02.922
Careful with those.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.468
We may have more than one life,
but those don't.

07:18.813 --> 07:21.316
Sato's just playing around!

07:22.108 --> 07:25.487
He doesn't give a damn
about a future for Ajin!

07:26.988 --> 07:29.407
Why are you staring into space like that?

07:30.659 --> 07:33.119
Thinking about food or something?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.246
No.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.751
Hey, Tanaka...

07:40.085 --> 07:40.919
Yeah?

07:41.795 --> 07:42.712
Do...?

07:44.798 --> 07:47.133
Do you think Sato really has our...?

07:47.467 --> 07:50.011
-The Ajin's best interests--?
-I said it before.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.139
We just have to trust him.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.854
And either way,
the next step is the last one.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.232
Right, Tanaka?

08:02.816 --> 08:03.650
Yeah.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.778
This will be it.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.197
The end.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.076
I sure hope so.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.174
I got those architectural plans
we talked about.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.761
I should be able
to finish entering the data

08:31.845 --> 08:33.638
for the underground tunnels today.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.433
Sorry, I've dumped so much on you.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.357
Very good.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.694
And how about that other thing?

08:48.153 --> 08:49.696
I think I can wrap it up on time.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.614
You're amazing, Okuyama.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.784
Well, this is going to be
another exciting event.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.663
This next one is the last one, right?

08:58.747 --> 09:00.915
Depends on what the enemy does.

09:01.624 --> 09:02.459
Why?

09:03.877 --> 09:05.336
No reason, really.

09:07.130 --> 09:07.964
I see.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.009
You can relax, though.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.554
I intend to seriously negotiate
with the government this time.

09:15.430 --> 09:19.434
That's why we took what we did
from Musashi Industries.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.271
Gotcha. I see what you mean.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.775
We can't keep playing war forever.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.526
That's right.

09:31.112 --> 09:34.282
I'll just be getting back to work, then.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.667
<i>The investigation has raised suspicions</i>

09:44.751 --> 09:46.836
<i>that Dr. Ogura was kidnapped</i>
<i>by the Ajin Sato.</i>

09:47.253 --> 09:50.924
<i>It was then that the safe house</i>
<i>was attacked by Sato.</i>

09:51.299 --> 09:54.135
<i>First you move to ensure safety,</i>
<i>then you get back in contact.</i>

09:54.677 --> 09:56.846
<i>That's the short version</i>
<i>of how it usually goes.</i>

09:57.597 --> 10:02.560
<i>This e-mail was the last we heard</i>
<i>from Douglas Almeida and Carly Myers.</i>

10:02.894 --> 10:05.146
<i>They disappeared after that,</i>
<i>and their whereabouts are unknown.</i>

10:05.730 --> 10:08.066
<i>During the debrief</i>
<i>of the safe house guards,</i>

10:08.149 --> 10:11.903
<i>we learned that they were under attack</i>
<i>from a small squad which included Ajin.</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:16.783
<i>We've also heard that afterward,</i>
<i>there was a car chase in the vicinity.</i>

10:17.117 --> 10:20.495
Given the circumstances, we have
to believe they were eliminated by Sato.

10:21.079 --> 10:24.707
<i>Which would mean</i>
<i>that Sato does indeed have Dr. Ogura.</i>

10:25.291 --> 10:27.377
<i>Will you ask Japan</i>
<i>for an investigation?</i>

10:27.460 --> 10:28.670
A waste of time.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.214
I don't think they can stand up to Sato.

10:31.548 --> 10:33.758
However, if we send another team over,

10:33.842 --> 10:36.845
we risk them meeting the same fate
as Almeida and Myers.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.012
<i>So...</i>

10:39.097 --> 10:42.809
Even if we wait for Sato's next strike,
that should give us enough time.

10:42.892 --> 10:46.604
Depending on the scale,
military intervention may be an option.

10:46.688 --> 10:47.522
<i>I see.</i>

10:47.981 --> 10:52.402
<i>That would give us a legal way</i>
<i>to secure Japan's Ajin.</i>

10:52.485 --> 10:53.570
Exactly.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.531
I'll report to the secretary myself.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.443
What the...?

11:55.673 --> 12:01.179
A day this beautiful deserves
a full frontal assault without subtlety.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.058
We've got a great show coming up
for you, folks.

12:20.865 --> 12:24.744
Emergency! Emergency!
Armed terrorists are inside the base!

12:24.827 --> 12:25.954
Our magazine is destroyed.

12:26.037 --> 12:28.414
<i>All guard squadrons,</i>
<i>head to Point 4 immediately!</i>

12:28.498 --> 12:31.626
<i>We've confirmed that the terrorists are</i>
<i>armed with rifles and rocket launchers.</i>

12:31.709 --> 12:35.254
<i>Other units are to acquire live ammunition</i>
<i>in the main building.</i>

12:35.338 --> 12:38.508
<i>This is not a drill!</i>
<i>Repeat! This is not a drill!</i>

12:38.591 --> 12:41.302
-Why can't we use the tanks!?
-Everything was in the magazine!

13:06.411 --> 13:09.247
-What the hell is with these guys?
-They're just charging in!

13:10.915 --> 13:12.166
Just neutralize them!

13:13.334 --> 13:14.293
<i>You guys...</i>

13:15.628 --> 13:17.463
<i>can't stop us.</i>

13:21.342 --> 13:22.719
Go! Go! Go!

13:26.097 --> 13:27.849
Damn it! Kill them! Stop them!

13:40.111 --> 13:40.987
What the--?!

13:50.621 --> 13:53.082
We've now lost the armory
in addition to the magazine.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.667
We have reports that they are Ajin.

13:54.959 --> 13:58.296
What?! Damn it, where is
the Central Readiness Force?!

13:58.379 --> 14:01.299
They're en route,
but still need more time to get here!

14:01.382 --> 14:02.300
Tell them to hurry!

14:02.717 --> 14:05.636
You're looking at a draft
of a settlement for Sato

14:05.720 --> 14:08.097
that has been drawn up
by the Ajin Control Commission.

14:08.598 --> 14:10.641
Prime Minister,
we have an emergency.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.936
A ground SDF garrison
is under attack by Sato.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.229
What?

14:17.565 --> 14:18.441
This is Tanaka.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.401
This area is secure.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.655
Roger that.
Carry on with what we talked about there.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.325
We'll be done here soon, too.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.701
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

14:28.785 --> 14:30.286
<i>Mr. Sato, wait!</i>

14:30.370 --> 14:32.372
We won't be done here anytime soon!

14:36.376 --> 14:37.919
Don't let them gain any ground!

14:38.002 --> 14:40.088
We just gotta hold on
until backup arrives!

14:44.717 --> 14:45.968
Damn it!

14:46.052 --> 14:47.178
Stay on target.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.806
They're nothing but terrorists!
Keep killing them!

14:57.438 --> 14:58.272
What the...?

15:12.370 --> 15:13.871
Didn't take long at all, did it?

15:13.955 --> 15:15.331
Right...

15:15.706 --> 15:16.541
Well, then,

15:17.250 --> 15:19.669
shall we take this place over?

15:20.044 --> 15:20.878
Yes, sir!

15:29.178 --> 15:31.848
I mean, that was easier
than I thought it'd be.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.517
The SDF is bound by the law.

15:34.600 --> 15:37.270
There's a limit on the weapons
they can deploy right away.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.606
Our plan to secure the magazine
and armory was most appropriate.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.525
Nagai!

15:43.109 --> 15:44.318
Nagai!

15:45.820 --> 15:46.737
Nagai!

15:50.908 --> 15:51.909
This is...

15:53.077 --> 15:54.704
video from Sato.

16:01.127 --> 16:01.961
Listen up!

16:02.336 --> 16:04.088
To support
the Central Readiness Force,

16:04.172 --> 16:06.257
we have to protect this place
with our lives!

16:06.340 --> 16:07.383
Yes, sir!

16:23.232 --> 16:24.233
Freeze!

16:31.240 --> 16:33.576
I know you guys have
to work around red tape,

16:34.285 --> 16:37.079
but I feel like I'm playing
on Easy Mode here.

16:42.043 --> 16:45.338
Mr. Prime Minister, it seems
they've seized the command building.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.089
How on Earth...?

16:47.423 --> 16:49.008
What's the situation there?!

16:49.509 --> 16:52.386
They've pinpointed the vital structures
and locked them down.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.681
Continuing to fight like this
will only increase casualties.

16:56.140 --> 16:58.267
We will withdraw
in order to regroup our forces.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.436
You're just going to let them win?!

17:00.520 --> 17:01.687
We are not.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.106
The CRF is already deploying
around the perimeter.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.108
Can't we launch a counter-attack?

17:06.442 --> 17:08.152
They may have chemical weapons.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.154
Please, let us handle this carefully.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.671
Mr. Sato, setup is complete.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.840
<i>You really have a way</i>
<i>with machines, Okuyama.</i>

17:30.258 --> 17:33.010
This was nothing.
These are standard models.

17:35.596 --> 17:39.141
They sure look impressive,
but will they actually work?

17:40.142 --> 17:42.937
This is the latest model,
with auto-fire capabilities.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.065
Was that supposed to be Okuyama?

17:54.949 --> 17:56.617
Sniper squad, in position.

17:57.118 --> 17:57.952
<i>Roger that.</i>

17:58.411 --> 18:00.079
The terrorists have taken hostages.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.790
We don't move until we have a read
on the situation inside.

18:02.873 --> 18:03.708
Yes, sir!

18:08.045 --> 18:11.299
Mr. Sato, the missile setup is complete.

18:12.258 --> 18:13.509
Excellent.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.470
Time to get this show back on the road.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.771
<i>Let me cut to the chase.</i>

18:26.439 --> 18:33.154
<i>We have prepared 20 high lethality</i>
<i>gas-loaded missiles for launch.</i>

18:34.113 --> 18:37.199
<i>You should already know</i>
<i>how effective they are.</i>

18:37.700 --> 18:40.661
<i>These murderous weapons were developed</i>

18:40.953 --> 18:43.706
<i>in secrecy at Musashi Industries</i>
<i>under government orders.</i>

18:44.498 --> 18:46.876
<i>Tanaka was their guinea pig,</i>
<i>as you'll recall.</i>

18:48.586 --> 18:51.297
<i>Here are our demands.</i>

18:52.381 --> 18:57.011
<i>Before 12 p.m. one week from today,</i>
<i>you are to evacuate Japan.</i>

18:58.846 --> 19:02.808
<i>We will be founding</i>
<i>an independent nation for Ajin.</i>

19:02.892 --> 19:04.644
Evacuate Japan?

19:04.727 --> 19:06.437
This is absurd.

19:06.520 --> 19:10.650
<i>Of course, I recognize</i>
<i>that this demand is extreme.</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:13.819
<i>But the government</i>
<i>has given no indication</i>

19:13.903 --> 19:16.697
<i>that they intend</i>
<i>to grant Ajin civil rights.</i>

19:16.947 --> 19:18.574
<i>So, I am left with no other choice.</i>

19:18.866 --> 19:21.118
<i>I must resort to using force.</i>

19:21.202 --> 19:22.370
All right!

19:23.079 --> 19:28.334
<i>I'm going to use this lethal gas</i>
<i>to kill everyone living in this country.</i>

19:33.089 --> 19:33.923
Yes.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.510
I think we have more than enough reason
for military intervention.

19:38.636 --> 19:42.348
No, we cannot let him fall into the hands
of the Japanese government.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.977
<i>As I expect all of this country's citizens</i>
<i>are well aware,</i>

19:48.229 --> 19:51.190
<i>I am not playing around.</i>

19:52.316 --> 19:53.984
END TRANSMISSION

19:56.612 --> 19:57.530
Suzumura.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.366
Can you handle weapons procurement?

20:02.451 --> 20:03.661
Weapons procurement.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.833
-That's possible, but why...?
-You know why.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.835
We have to stop Sato.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.379
Are you serious?

20:13.921 --> 20:17.133
-But we no longer have any backing.
-That doesn't matter.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.429
Sato's already killed so many.

20:22.513 --> 20:25.224
He won't hesitate
to push the launch button.

20:26.767 --> 20:27.601
I have to...

20:32.314 --> 20:36.193
No, this isn't just my problem anymore.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.362
Suzumura, take care of it.

20:39.530 --> 20:43.492
I follow orders. And that's all.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.162
That's what Hirasawa would've said.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.248
Yes, sir.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.753
I'm not sure what's going on,
but we're taking down Sato, yeah?

20:53.836 --> 20:55.504
-That's right.
-All right!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.090
Time to get some payback
for the old guys!

20:59.592 --> 21:00.426
Nagai.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.303
I won't do it.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.388
What did you say?

21:14.315 --> 21:16.442
TO BE CONTINUED

21:17.735 --> 21:20.696
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

21:20.780 --> 21:24.033
<i>I'll trade it</i>

21:24.116 --> 21:29.288
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

21:30.456 --> 21:36.754
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

21:36.837 --> 21:42.176
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

21:43.177 --> 21:47.431
<i>You can see them all</i>

21:49.600 --> 21:54.021
<i>When you come to my house</i>

21:54.104 --> 22:00.152
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

22:00.236 --> 22:02.363
<i>While the wind blows</i>

22:02.446 --> 22:06.283
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

22:08.828 --> 22:15.084
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

22:15.167 --> 22:21.465
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

22:21.549 --> 22:27.429
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

22:28.013 --> 22:30.724
<i>"Be my friend</i>

22:30.808 --> 22:37.606
<i>Always"</i>
