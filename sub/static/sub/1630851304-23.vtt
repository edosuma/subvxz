WEBVTT

00:01.413 --> 00:05.517
PREVIOUSLY ON "BIG BROTHER"...THE

00:05.551 --> 00:09.034
POWERFUL COOKOUT ALLIANCE
WAS OPERATING COMPLETELY

00:09.068 --> 00:10.137
UNDETECTED.

00:10.172 --> 00:13.379
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
CAN THERE BE ANY WHIFF OF

00:13.413 --> 00:15.793
AN IDEA THAT MEMBERS OF
THE COOKOUT ARE WORKING

00:15.827 --> 00:16.793
TOGETHER.

00:16.827 --> 00:19.517
AND EACH
HAD AN OBLIVIOUS PARTNER

00:19.551 --> 00:21.620
OUTSIDE THE GROUP TO GET
THEM FURTHER IN THE GAME.

00:21.655 --> 00:28.068
IF ONE OF THE DUO'S
ENDS UP ON THE BLOCK, THE

00:28.103 --> 00:32.137
COOKOFF HAS THE NUMBERS TO
HELP US STAY SAFE.

00:32.172 --> 00:35.862
XAVIER HAS WON THE
GOLDEN POWER VETO.

00:35.896 --> 00:39.620
AND PUNISHMENT.

00:39.655 --> 00:43.413
B.B. BANKRUPTCY,
STRATEGY SHUTDOWN, TO

00:43.448 --> 00:46.655
BECOME THE THIRD NOMINEE
AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY.

00:46.689 --> 00:48.896
AFTER XAVIER PULLS HIMSELF FROM

00:48.931 --> 00:49.931
THE BLOCK.

00:49.965 --> 00:52.620
I DECIDED TO USE THE
POWER OF VETO ON MYSELF.

00:52.655 --> 00:57.344
HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD SARAH BETH

00:57.379 --> 00:58.275
BACKDOORED BABY "D."

00:58.310 --> 01:00.034
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

01:00.068 --> 01:01.137
BEFORE THE
LIVE VOTES, DEREK X. PUT

01:01.172 --> 01:02.103
S. B. ON BLAST.

01:02.137 --> 01:04.827
IF I STAY, I WILL
PROMISE I WILL TAKE THIS

01:04.862 --> 01:07.379
PERSON OUT AND I WILL BE
YOUR BIGGEST SHIELD.

01:07.413 --> 01:12.241
BUT IT
WASN'T ENOUGH TO PREVENT A

01:12.275 --> 01:13.344
DEREK X. EXIT.

01:13.379 --> 01:18.413
BY A VOTE OF 5-2, BABY
"D," YOU ARE EVICTED FROM

01:18.448 --> 01:19.482
THE "BIG BROTHER" HOUSE.

01:19.517 --> 01:28.000
WITH THE
POWER BACK UP FOR GRABS --

01:28.034 --> 01:32.758
DEREK F. AND
KYLAND, RESTEP AND STEP

01:32.793 --> 01:33.758
DOWN.

01:33.793 --> 01:36.793
TIFFANY GOT HER FIRST WIN OF THE

01:36.827 --> 01:37.586
SUMMER.

01:37.620 --> 01:40.137
CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU,

01:40.172 --> 01:40.896
TIFFANY.

01:40.931 --> 01:43.896
YOU'RE THE NEW HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD.

01:43.931 --> 01:46.206
INSIDE ARE DIFFERENT
DENOMINATIONS OF B.B.

01:46.241 --> 01:48.206
BUCKS.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.965
WITH ONLY
NINE REMAINING IN THE

01:50.000 --> 01:53.379
BATTLE FOR THREE-QUARTERS
OF A MILLION DOLLARS, WHO

01:53.413 --> 01:55.620
WILL TIFFANY TARGET FOR
EVICTION?

01:55.655 --> 02:03.379
BUT WILL THE COIN OF
DESTINY END THE FORMER

02:03.413 --> 02:04.206
QUEEN'S REIGN EARLY?

02:04.241 --> 02:07.482
FIND OUT RIGHT NOW ON "BIG
BROTHER"!

02:07.517 --> 02:12.206
HE'S A PLAYER, PLAYER,
OKAY?

02:12.241 --> 02:18.172
GOOD NIGHT

02:18.206 --> 02:20.448
HOUSEGUESTS.

02:20.482 --> 02:23.551
GOOD NIGHT, JULIE!

02:24.482 --> 02:26.034
AHH, I DID IT.

02:26.068 --> 02:29.172
I FEEL AMAZING!

02:29.206 --> 02:31.758
FINALLY, I CAN WIN
SOMETHING IN THIS HOUSE!

02:31.793 --> 02:39.172
IT IS YOUR NEW H.O.H.,
GUYS, IT'S ME.

02:39.206 --> 02:40.896
ULTIMATELY, I DECIDED

02:40.931 --> 02:45.482
IT WAS NOT WORTH RISKING
THE COOKOUT TO SAVE DEREK

02:45.517 --> 02:48.068
X., EVEN THOUGH I REALLY
WANTED TO.

02:48.103 --> 02:58.862
I LOVE THAT KID.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.137
YES!

03:14.172 --> 03:15.241
OH, MY GOSH!

03:15.275 --> 03:17.137
WE'RE FREAKING OUT.

03:17.172 --> 03:20.103
I'M SO PROUD OF
TIFFANY.

03:20.137 --> 03:21.413
I'M SO EXCITED.

03:21.448 --> 03:27.827
I'VE BEEN ON THE BLOCK
FOR TWO WEEKS, AND FINALLY

03:27.862 --> 03:31.137
MY TIGHTEST ALLY IN THIS
GAME IS H.O.H.

03:31.172 --> 03:34.344
I CAN FINALLY TAKE A DEEP
BREATH BECAUSE I'M NOT

03:34.379 --> 03:38.068
GOING TO HIT THIS DANG
BLOCK THIS WEEK.

03:38.103 --> 03:40.724
AS LONG AS QUEEN OF
DESTINY DOESN'T SCREW US

03:40.758 --> 03:41.448
OVER.

03:41.482 --> 03:47.517
THIS WEEK SHOULD BE
FANTASTIC.

03:47.551 --> 03:51.965
DON'T MAKE ME CRY.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.413
DON'T EVEN MAKE ME CRY.

03:53.448 --> 04:02.000
WALL STCRY.

04:02.034 --> 04:07.931
I KNOW.

04:07.965 --> 04:10.517
HE WILL UNDERSTAND ONCE
HE SEES EVERYTHING.

04:10.551 --> 04:11.862
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

04:11.896 --> 04:13.724
I KNOW.

04:13.758 --> 04:16.034
I KNOW, BABY.

04:16.068 --> 04:16.517
I KNOW.

04:16.551 --> 04:20.206
I DON'T GET IT.

04:20.241 --> 04:21.482
THEY'RE WORKING

04:21.517 --> 04:22.517
TOGETHER ALREADY.

04:22.551 --> 04:26.862
STAY FOCUSED BECAUSE
YOU HAVE TO PLAY A GOOD

04:26.896 --> 04:27.517
ROLE THIS WEEK.

04:27.551 --> 04:31.896
YEP.

04:31.931 --> 04:41.034
HE IS JUST...HE IS JUST

04:41.068 --> 04:44.827
SUCH A GENUINE GUY, AND I
DON'T REGRET SENDING HIM

04:44.862 --> 04:45.896
HOME.

04:45.931 --> 04:48.137
HE WAS THE BIGGEST THREAT
AT THIS TIME TO THE SIX

04:48.172 --> 04:49.448
COMPLETING OUR MISSION.

04:49.482 --> 04:54.724
HOWEVER, IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M FOT NOT SAD ABOUT IT.

04:54.758 --> 04:57.931
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
WE'RE DOING IT.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.896
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

04:59.931 --> 05:05.965
YEP.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.344
DID YOU HEAR THE
SPEECHES?

05:08.379 --> 05:11.068
I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.172
THERE IS SOMEONE IN
THIS HOUSE THAT IS PLAYING

05:14.206 --> 05:15.000
A NICOLE GAME.

05:15.034 --> 05:19.413
I'M HER BIGGEST THREAT IN
THIS GAME.

05:19.448 --> 05:22.068
IF I STAY, I WILL TAKE
THIS PERSON OUT.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.931
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO

05:23.965 --> 05:24.724
RESPOND TO IT.

05:24.758 --> 05:28.137
I MEAN, I CAN'T LIE.

05:28.172 --> 05:32.620
DEREK'S SPEECH WAS
HURTFUL, EVEN THOUGH IT

05:32.655 --> 05:39.586
DOES HURT TO HEAR, I JUST
HAVE TO STICK TO MY GUNS

05:39.620 --> 05:41.551
AND REMEMBER WHAT I CAME
HERE FOR.

05:41.586 --> 05:45.862
I'VE GOT TO PULL MYSELF
TOGETHER AND ACT LIKE I'M

05:45.896 --> 05:47.931
TOTALLY COMFORTABLE WITH
TIFFANY WINNING, IF IT IS

05:47.965 --> 05:48.689
HARD.

05:48.724 --> 05:50.413
I DID KEEP TIFFANY OFF THE
BLOCK.

05:50.448 --> 05:53.034
SHE WAS NEVER AN OPTION
FOR ME AT ANY POINT.

05:53.068 --> 05:55.517
SO HOPEFULLY THAT WILL
MEAN SOMETHING TO TIFFANY.

05:55.551 --> 05:59.931
HOW DO YOU FEEL WITH
TIFFANY BEING IN CHARGE?

05:59.965 --> 06:06.965
UM...I DON'T KNOW.

06:07.000 --> 06:07.758
YEAH.

06:07.793 --> 06:09.379
I REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW
I FEEL.

06:09.413 --> 06:11.448
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FEEL.

06:11.482 --> 06:15.206
I KNOW SHE CAN'T NOMINATE
ME BECAUSE I'M ALREADY UP

06:15.241 --> 06:16.172
THERE.

06:16.206 --> 06:20.620
I WAS REALLY HOPING
THAT KYLAND, ALYSSA OR

06:20.655 --> 06:23.689
XAVIER WOULD WIN THIS
H.O.H., BECAUSE WE FORMED

06:23.724 --> 06:27.103
AN ALLIANCE A FEW DAYS AGO
CALLED THE MONARCHY.

06:27.137 --> 06:30.586
I FEEL READY TO START
FRESH AT THIS POINT, AND I

06:30.620 --> 06:32.275
WANT TO WORK WITH THE TWO
OF YOU.

06:32.310 --> 06:35.965
DID YOU GUYS WANT TO MAKE
IT OFFICIAL, OFFICIAL,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.034
LIKE A NAME?

06:38.068 --> 06:39.310
OH, A NAME.

06:39.344 --> 06:40.137
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

06:40.172 --> 06:44.965
THE MONARCHY.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.793
LOOK AT YOUR IVY LEAGUE

06:49.827 --> 06:50.172
SHIRT.

06:50.206 --> 06:50.689
HOW ARE YOU?

06:50.724 --> 06:55.965
I'M OKAY.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.689
I'M NOT GOING -- I'M

06:58.724 --> 06:59.551
ALREADY ON THE BLOCK.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.620
OH, YEAH.

07:01.655 --> 07:06.137
YOU KNOW, WITH ME BEING
THE THIRD NOMINEE AND NOW

07:06.172 --> 07:09.275
TIFFANY BEING IN POWER, I
JUST -- I DON'T REALLY

07:09.310 --> 07:14.000
LIKE MY ODDS THIS WEEK.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.586
NOT!

07:15.620 --> 07:18.034
NOT WORKING, THE MONARCHY,
THOSE ARE ALL GOOD AND

07:18.068 --> 07:21.827
WELL, BUT MY HEART IS MOST
TRUE TO THE COOKOUT.

07:21.862 --> 07:25.965
UNFORTUNATELY ANYBODY WHO
IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE

07:26.000 --> 07:28.689
COOKOUT, IS GOING TO HAVE
TO GO.

07:28.724 --> 07:32.896
WOULD THEY PUT ME UP
THERE WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

07:32.931 --> 07:35.379
POSSIBLY.

07:35.413 --> 07:39.310
LIKE ME AND BIG "D"?

07:39.344 --> 07:39.793
OH!

07:39.827 --> 07:42.758
WE WORKED HARD.

07:42.793 --> 07:47.758
THEY COULD DO THE THREE
KINGS.

07:47.793 --> 07:50.517
I'M SURE IF ONE OF US GOES
HOME --

07:50.551 --> 07:51.206
UH-HUH.

07:51.241 --> 07:51.793
TRUE.

07:51.827 --> 07:55.103
WELL, NO, IT DOESN'T.

07:55.137 --> 07:56.793
THAT'S TRUE.

07:56.827 --> 08:00.206
THE QUEEN OF DESTINY IS
PRETTY CRAZY FOR A POWER.

08:00.241 --> 08:03.793
YOU GET TO WIN A CHANCE TO
OVERTHROW THE H.O.H.

08:03.827 --> 08:05.310
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY HUGE.

08:05.344 --> 08:07.241
THIS IS THE BIGGEST POWER
THAT HAS EVER BEEN IN THE

08:07.275 --> 08:08.068
GAME.

08:08.103 --> 08:11.517
IT IS GOING TO BE A
WEEK OF WORK.

08:11.551 --> 08:15.793
I HOPE I'M READY FOR

08:15.827 --> 08:17.517
THIS.

08:17.551 --> 08:19.655
YOU'RE READY.

08:19.689 --> 08:21.206
OKAY.

08:21.241 --> 08:24.551
KYLAND SHOULD EXPECT
THE GO.

08:24.586 --> 08:27.896
HE SAID WINNER DUO IS
NOMINATED, AND WE'RE

08:27.931 --> 08:29.103
NOMINATED AS THE DUO.

08:29.137 --> 08:31.758
IT JUST MAKES SENSE.

08:31.793 --> 08:33.344
SENDING SARAH BETH HOME
HAS BEEN ON MY MIND FOR

08:33.379 --> 08:34.379
WEEKS.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.413
SHE HAS NO LOYALTY TO
ANYONE IN THIS HOUSE, THAT

08:36.448 --> 08:41.482
INCLUDES ME AS WELL.

08:44.068 --> 08:46.896
YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
PERSONS.

08:46.931 --> 08:51.551
IF THAT MAKES SENSE FOR
YOU --

08:51.586 --> 08:54.344
WHAT IS --
I DON'T REALLY WANT TO

08:54.379 --> 08:58.310
GO ON THE BLOCK, BUT WE'RE
AT THE POINT IN THE GAME

08:58.344 --> 09:01.379
NOW WHERE I CAN'T PROTECT
SARAH BETH ANY LONGER

09:01.413 --> 09:05.310
WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING THE
COOKOUT.

09:05.344 --> 09:09.172
WHAT WILL IT LIKE IF
YOU DO HER WRONG?

09:09.206 --> 09:10.931
THERE IS NO WAY.

09:10.965 --> 09:12.172
YOU'RE READY TO GO.

09:12.206 --> 09:12.793
YOU'RE READY.

09:12.827 --> 09:14.275
YEAH.

09:25.655 --> 09:29.068
HOW ARE THINGS?

09:29.103 --> 09:32.034
I GOT UP THERE.

09:32.068 --> 09:36.241
I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW HIS
BRACELET.

09:36.275 --> 09:42.448
AND THAT WAS, LIKE, GOOD
FOR YOU.

09:44.413 --> 09:45.586
I FEEL SO GUILTY.

09:45.620 --> 09:53.344
IT'S ALL PART...

09:53.379 --> 09:57.620
"X" WAS GOING TO GO
THROUGH IT, I WAS GOING TO

09:57.655 --> 10:01.586
GO THROUGH IT, I'M GOING
TO GO THROUGH IT.

10:01.620 --> 10:06.965
HE CHOSE US BEFORE WE
CHOSE ANYBODY US, AND WE

10:07.000 --> 10:12.034
HAVE UNSELFISHLY PLAYED
FOR EACH OTHER.

10:12.068 --> 10:13.137
I KNOW.

10:13.172 --> 10:17.000
AND PEOPLE WILL BE HURT
ALONG THE WAY, BUT HE IS A

10:17.034 --> 10:19.793
GREAT PERSON --
HE IS SO AMAZING.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.551
AND HE WILL STILL BE
YOUR FRIEND.

10:22.586 --> 10:30.000
I REALLY HOPE HE CAN
FORGIVE ME.

10:30.034 --> 10:34.724
GET IT TOGETHER, HANNAH

10:34.758 --> 10:37.586
I FEEL AWFUL AND I FEEL SO
GUILTY FOR SENDING HIM

10:37.620 --> 10:40.862
HOME.

10:40.896 --> 10:46.103
IF NOT FOR THE COOKOUT, HE
WOULD DEFINITELY BE MY

10:46.137 --> 10:50.655
NUMBER ONE IN HIS GAME
BECAUSE HE HAD MY BACK.

10:50.689 --> 10:52.137
YOU ARE VERY SMART.

10:52.172 --> 10:56.275
YOU ARE VERY INTELLIGENT.

10:56.310 --> 10:57.862
YOU HAVE SUCH A BRIGHT
FUTURE.

10:57.896 --> 11:01.793
I AM JUST SO HAPPY TO HAVE
MET YOU IN THIS HOUSE.

11:01.827 --> 11:13.137
YOU ARE JUST LIKE MY
FAMILY.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.034
HOLD THAT DOOR OPEN.

11:15.068 --> 11:16.620
YOU'RE A BAD BITCH.

11:16.655 --> 11:17.655
I'M A BAD BITCH.

11:17.689 --> 11:21.344
DON'T THINK I'M COMING IN
HERE BECAUSE I'VE GOT

11:21.379 --> 11:23.482
MONEY, SO I AIN'T WORRIED.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.206
WHOA, NELLIE!

11:25.241 --> 11:29.103
I'M HAPPY YOU FINALLY
GOT YOUR MOMENT.

11:29.137 --> 11:33.034
AS SOON AS I HEARD
TIFFANY, I'M OH, MY GOSH!

11:33.068 --> 11:34.137
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

11:34.172 --> 11:35.448
I FEEL GOOD.

11:35.482 --> 11:36.206
I'M GLAD.

11:36.241 --> 11:37.172
ABSOLUTELY.

11:37.206 --> 11:39.793
IT'S GOOD.

11:39.827 --> 11:42.620
OTHER PEOPLE MAY HAVE THE
POSSIBILITY OF PLAYING,

11:42.655 --> 11:46.379
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE PEOPLE I WANT TO

11:46.413 --> 11:50.206
TURN TO -- I THINK IF YOU
AND A COUPLE OF OTHER

11:50.241 --> 11:52.206
PEOPLE CAN HAVE THAT
OPPORTUNITY.

11:52.241 --> 11:55.896
THERE CAN BE AN
ANONYMOUS H.O.H. THIS

11:55.931 --> 11:58.517
WEEK, AND IF THERE IS, I
WOULD RATHER IT BE

11:58.551 --> 12:01.206
SOMEBODY I'M WORKING WITH
AND NOT CHANGE MY

12:01.241 --> 12:02.137
NOMINATIONS.

12:02.172 --> 12:07.482
I KNOW D DEREK X. HAS THE
MONEY.

12:07.517 --> 12:10.655
WE MAY FIGHT LIKE
SIBLINGS, BUT WE ARE

12:10.689 --> 12:11.758
WORKING TOGETHER.

12:11.793 --> 12:15.206
I DO WANT YOU TO PLAY,
AND I WANT YOU TO PLAY TO

12:15.241 --> 12:15.620
WIN.

12:15.655 --> 12:16.965
YOU GOT IT.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.206
I'M DOING EVERYTHING YOU
TELL ME TO DO.

12:19.241 --> 12:21.758
OKAY.

12:21.793 --> 12:25.827
HOLD ON --
NO, NO, NO.

12:25.862 --> 12:28.068
NOT JUST TRUSTING
EVERYTHING I'M DOING.

12:28.103 --> 12:30.379
ACTUALLY, YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO

12:30.413 --> 12:31.206
BECAUSE I TRUST YOU.

12:31.241 --> 12:33.758
OH, GOSH.

12:33.793 --> 12:37.413
DO YOU BELIEVE HE'S A
PAWN?

12:37.448 --> 12:40.758
HONESTLY, GIRL, I DON'T
TRUST YOU.

12:40.793 --> 12:44.793
ME AND TIFFANY HAVE BEEN
GOING AT IT ALL SEASON.

12:44.827 --> 12:49.103
IF IT WASN'T FOR THE
COOKOUT, TRUST ME, YOUR

12:49.137 --> 12:51.344
AASS WOULD BE GONE.

12:51.379 --> 12:53.620
I WOULD MAKE SURE YOU WERE
GONE.

12:53.655 --> 12:54.620
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

12:54.655 --> 12:55.206
THANK YOU.

12:55.241 --> 12:59.000
YEP, YOU GOT IT.

13:03.862 --> 13:08.482
WITN WHAT'S UP?

13:08.517 --> 13:08.896
CONGRATULATIONS.

13:08.931 --> 13:10.241
THANK YOU.

13:10.275 --> 13:13.931
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
PLAYING DESTINY OR YOUR

13:13.965 --> 13:15.655
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO
PLAY?

13:15.689 --> 13:17.000
I WILL HAVE A CHANCE.

13:17.034 --> 13:19.068
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I
COULD END UP QUITTING.

13:19.103 --> 13:23.517
THE ONLY WAY I COULD
AFFORD TO PLAY THE COIN OF

13:23.551 --> 13:28.310
DESTINY IS IF AMERICA GAVE
ME 100 B.B. BUCKS AND I

13:28.344 --> 13:30.965
HAVE 100 B.B. BUCKS IN MY
ENVELOPE.

13:31.000 --> 13:34.620
I MEAN, WHO KNOWS WOULD
COULD HAPPEN.

13:34.655 --> 13:35.931
BUT TIFFANY DOESN'T NEED
TO KNOW THAT.

13:35.965 --> 13:38.517
IF SHE THINKS THERE IS A
POTENTIAL I COULD PLAY IN

13:38.551 --> 13:41.931
THE QUEEN OF DESTINY,
MAYBE SHE'LL THINK TWICE

13:41.965 --> 13:44.000
ABOUT PUTTING ME AND
KYLAND ON THE BLOCK.

13:44.034 --> 13:50.034
HE IS STILL MY FRIEND,
SO I'M STILL A LITTLE

13:50.068 --> 13:52.379
EMOTIONAL ABOUT HIM
WALKING OUT THE DOOR.

13:52.413 --> 13:54.448
WE HAD A REALLY TIGHT BOND
SINCE DAY TWO.

13:54.482 --> 14:01.103
IT IS NOT A SHOT THAT I --
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

14:01.137 --> 14:02.103
TOOK IT.

14:02.137 --> 14:03.344
IT REALLY PUT ME IN A
SITUATION BECAUSE IT IS

14:03.379 --> 14:06.000
CLEAR THERE ARE NO GUYS
FIGHTING FOR ME IN THIS

14:06.034 --> 14:06.379
GAME.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.655
RIGHT.

14:07.689 --> 14:11.620
I'M OVER HERE RELYING
ON MYSELF.

14:11.655 --> 14:16.344
IT DID JEOPARDIZE MY GAME
INDIRECTLY, AND IT IS,

14:16.379 --> 14:20.689
LIKE, OKAY, WE DIDN'T KILL
YOU, BUT WE CUT OFF YOUR

14:20.724 --> 14:21.758
LEGS.

14:21.793 --> 14:25.344
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
SENDING "X" WHAT MAKE YOU

14:25.379 --> 14:29.068
FEEL LIKE I CUT OFF YOUR
LEGS.

14:29.103 --> 14:30.793
I GUESS THAT KIND OF
SURPRISED ME TO HEAR YOU

14:30.827 --> 14:32.793
SAY THAT.

14:32.827 --> 14:35.068
THE "X" WAS NEVER
COMING FOR ME.

14:35.103 --> 14:37.517
I APPRECIATE YOU BEING
HONEST WITH ME.

14:37.551 --> 14:40.827
IF I WERE TO BE SAFE THIS
WEEK, THEN I DON'T HAVE

14:40.862 --> 14:42.517
ANY INCENTIVE TO GO AFTER
YOU.

14:42.551 --> 14:47.827
IT IS OBVIOUS THAT
TIFFANY IS NOT HAPPY THAT

14:47.862 --> 14:49.551
DEREK X. LEFT.

14:49.586 --> 14:53.620
I'M HOPING THAT I CAN
CONVINCE HER THAT I DIDN'T

14:53.655 --> 14:55.793
SEND DEREK X. HOME TO
WEAKEN HER GAME -- EVEN

14:55.827 --> 14:57.068
THOUGH THAT IS NOT EXACTLY
TRUE.

14:57.103 --> 15:01.379
I WILL DEFINITELY RUN
SOME SCENARIOS IN MY HEAD

15:01.413 --> 15:06.724
AND FIGURE OUT WHAT IS
BEST FOR ME TO DO MOVING

15:06.758 --> 15:07.172
FORWARD.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.241
WHO WANTS TO SEE MY
H.O.H. CARD!

15:29.310 --> 15:35.275
THANKS, GUYS!

15:35.310 --> 15:36.137
YAY!

15:36.172 --> 15:40.448
LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE,
LET ME SEE!

15:40.482 --> 15:44.379
OH, MY GOSH, HE IS SO
CUTE.

15:44.413 --> 15:49.482
OKAY, C'MON!

15:49.517 --> 15:53.103
LOOK AT MY BABY, HE'S
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

15:53.137 --> 15:54.758
I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS.

15:54.793 --> 15:56.724
WE'VE GOT NEW PICTURES.

15:56.758 --> 16:00.862
OKAY.

16:00.896 --> 16:04.517
OH!

16:04.551 --> 16:08.689
YES, YES, YES!

16:08.724 --> 16:13.206
OH, MY GOSH, I'M GOING
TO CRY.

16:13.241 --> 16:14.310
ALL RIGHT.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.034
WE ARE READY FOR YOUR
LETTER.

16:16.068 --> 16:18.310
I AM NOT GOING TO CRY.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.034
OKAY.

16:19.068 --> 16:20.344
YOU GOT IT.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.620
HI, TIFFANY.

16:22.655 --> 16:23.689
CONGRATULATIONS.

16:23.724 --> 16:25.551
WE ARE TRULY PROUD OF YOU
AND PRAYING FOR YOUR WIN

16:25.586 --> 16:27.034
AND SAFETY.

16:27.068 --> 16:29.551
CHRISTIAN IS LOVING HIS
NEW HIGH SCHOOL, AND HE IS

16:29.586 --> 16:31.034
DOING MARVELOUS IN BAND.

16:31.068 --> 16:32.275
WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

16:32.310 --> 16:35.310
DO WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO
WIN.

16:35.344 --> 16:39.275
YOU ARE A WINNER ALWAYS.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.724
YOU ARE TRULY MISSED.

16:40.758 --> 16:41.862
STAY HAPPY AND FOCUSED.

16:41.896 --> 16:43.241
YOU CAN DO THIS.

16:43.275 --> 16:44.827
WE ARE ROOTING FOR YOU.

16:44.862 --> 16:49.620
LOVE YOU, MOM, PAT, AND
CHRISTIAN."

16:49.655 --> 16:53.551
OH, MY GOSH.

16:53.586 --> 16:57.551
FOR THOSE GUYS WHO
DON'T KNOW WHO MAMA PAT

16:57.586 --> 17:00.655
IS, SHE IS MY GRANDMOTHER,
BUT SHE RAISED ME.

17:00.689 --> 17:02.206
SHE IS SUCH A WONDERFUL
WOMAN.

17:02.241 --> 17:05.344
SHE IS A TEACHER, SHE
ADOPTS KIDS AND BRINGS

17:05.379 --> 17:05.896
THEM HOME.

17:05.931 --> 17:07.000
SHE HAS SO MUCH LOVE.

17:07.034 --> 17:11.517
SHE IS MY HEART AND MY
INSPIRATION TO MY LIFE.

17:11.551 --> 17:12.896
I THINK THE ONLY THING I
EVER REALLY WANT TO HEAR

17:12.931 --> 17:17.620
HER SAY IS THAT SHE PROUD
OF ME.

17:17.655 --> 17:22.689
I AM PLAYING MY ENTIRE
GAME TO MAKE MAMA PAT

17:22.724 --> 17:27.103
PROUD AND TO MAKE A LIFE
AND A FUTURE FOR CHRISTIAN

17:27.137 --> 17:29.206
AND MYSELF.

17:29.241 --> 17:34.655
SHE IS SO PROUD OF YOU.

17:34.689 --> 17:42.034
HI, MAMA PAT!

17:42.068 --> 17:43.137
WHAT'S UP?

17:43.172 --> 17:48.862
UM, OBVIOUSLY GOING OFF
OUR CONVERSATION EARLIER,

17:48.896 --> 17:51.724
I JUST THINK WE SAID --
THERE ARE A FEW MORE

17:51.758 --> 17:53.275
THINGS I WANTED TO SAY.

17:53.310 --> 17:54.827
AFTER MY FIRST
CONVERSATION WITH TIFFANY,

17:54.862 --> 17:58.689
SHE MADE IT CLEAR SHE IS
CONSIDERING TARGETING ME

17:58.724 --> 17:59.793
AND KYLAND.

17:59.827 --> 18:03.137
I JUST WANT TO DO AVERRING
EVERYTHING I CAN TO SEE IF

18:03.172 --> 18:05.689
I CAN GET HER TO LOOK AT
OTHER PEOPLE.

18:05.724 --> 18:08.448
MAYBE HE WAS REALLY CLOSE
TO WINNING THIS LAST

18:08.482 --> 18:11.172
H.O.H., AND HE MISSED IT,
AND YOU HAD A VERY VISIBLE

18:11.206 --> 18:12.137
REACTION.

18:12.172 --> 18:16.482
YOU LOOKED REALLY
DISAPPOINTED, WHICH I WAS,

18:16.517 --> 18:17.137
LIKE, YOU...

18:17.172 --> 18:19.103
I SAW HOW CLOSE SHE
WAS.

18:19.137 --> 18:21.724
REALLY?

18:21.758 --> 18:22.620
I DIDN'T SEE.

18:22.655 --> 18:26.034
I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
THAT, BUT --

18:26.068 --> 18:29.206
THAT'S JUST THE TYPE OF
PLAYER ALYSSA IS.

18:29.241 --> 18:32.137
I KNOW SHE LIES TO OTHER
PEOPLE --

18:32.172 --> 18:33.862
IT SEEMS LIKE SHE HAS A
LOT OF SIDES.

18:33.896 --> 18:36.137
I DON'T WANT YOU TO
THINK I HAVE LOYALTY TO

18:36.172 --> 18:36.862
HER.

18:36.896 --> 18:38.758
I DO NOT.

18:38.793 --> 18:43.965
OH, S.B., I HATE THIS
GAME SOMETIMES.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.551
I KNOW, I HATE IT, TOO.

18:46.586 --> 18:53.137
I GENERALLY APPRECIATE
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME.

18:53.172 --> 18:54.344
SHE IS VERY CONVINCING.

18:54.379 --> 18:57.068
I MEAN, SHE RAN ALYSSA
OVER WITH THE BUS.

18:57.103 --> 18:58.275
ALYSSA IS IN THE I.C.U.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.551
RIGHT NOW.

19:00.586 --> 19:03.103
THAT'S HOW HARD SARAH BETH
CAME TO GET ALYSSA ON THE

19:03.137 --> 19:04.103
BLOCK.

19:04.137 --> 19:08.413
AND I SERIOUSLY CANNOT
BELIEVE THAT I'M SAYING

19:08.448 --> 19:12.931
THIS, BUT WITH THE COIN OF
DDESTINY IN PLAY, I MAY

19:12.965 --> 19:16.551
HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER
OPTIONS.

19:16.586 --> 19:21.000
DANG, SHE IS GOING TO
BE SECOND-GUESSING IT.

19:43.551 --> 19:44.413
HEY, GUYS.

19:44.448 --> 19:50.137
IT IS TIME FOR THE
NOMINATION CEREMONY.

20:08.172 --> 20:12.344
THIS IS THE NOMINATION
CEREMONY.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.034
XAVIER, BECAUSE YOU CHOSE
THE THIRD NOMINEE

20:15.068 --> 20:18.068
PUNISHMENT AND LAST WEEK
VETO COMPETITION, YOU ARE

20:18.103 --> 20:23.482
NOW ON THE BLOCK AS THE
THIRD NOMINEE.

20:23.517 --> 20:26.482
IT IS NOW MY
RESPONSIBILITY AS THE HEAD

20:26.517 --> 20:31.137
OF HOUSEHOLD TO NOMINATE
TWO OTHER HOUSEGUESTS FOR

20:31.172 --> 20:32.068
EVICTION.

20:32.103 --> 20:35.034
IN MY NOMINATION BLOCK ARE
THE KEYS OF THE

20:35.068 --> 20:38.068
HOUSEGUESTS I AM
NOMINATING FOR EVICTION.

20:38.103 --> 20:43.034
I WILL TURN TWO KEYS TO
LOCK IN MY NOMINATIONS AND

20:43.068 --> 20:45.551
THEIR FACES WILL APPEAR ON
THE MEMORY WALL.

20:45.586 --> 21:02.103
THE FIRST HOUSEGUEST I
HAVE NOMINATED IS...

21:02.137 --> 21:06.034
THE NEXT HOUSEGUEST I

21:06.068 --> 21:12.310
HAVE NOMINATED IS...

21:18.965 --> 21:23.827
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU,
KYLAND, AND YOU, SARAH

21:23.862 --> 21:24.758
BETH.

21:24.793 --> 21:29.931
YOU TWO MAKE UP A VERY
POWERFUL DUO IN THIS

21:29.965 --> 21:30.965
HOUSE.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.034
THIS WEEK I NEED TO MAKE
AN OPTIMAL MOVE TO EXCEL

21:35.068 --> 21:37.862
MY OWN PERSONAL GAME, AND
THIS IS THE DECISION THAT

21:37.896 --> 21:39.310
I HAVE MADE.

21:39.344 --> 21:42.793
AND I WISH YOU BOTH LUCK.

21:42.827 --> 21:50.068
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY
IS ADJOURNED.

21:50.103 --> 21:56.310
I HAVE NOMINATED KYLAND

21:56.344 --> 21:59.758
AND SARAH BETH, BUT JUST
IN CASE ANYONE MISSED IT,

21:59.793 --> 22:02.586
SARAH BETH IS MY TARGET.

22:02.620 --> 22:06.586
I AM NOT GOING TO MISS
TAKING THIS SHOT AT SARAH

22:06.620 --> 22:08.103
BETH TO NOMINATE ALYSSA.

22:08.137 --> 22:10.068
I'LL GET ALYSSA NEXT TIME.

22:10.103 --> 22:13.275
MY PLAN IS ALL IN PLACE.

22:13.310 --> 22:16.068
HOWEVER, NOTHING IS FOR
CERTAIN, ESPECIALLY WITH

22:16.103 --> 22:18.724
THE COIN OF DESTINY.

22:18.758 --> 22:23.068
SOMEONE COULD COME AND
TOTALLY OVERTHROW MY

22:23.103 --> 22:24.137
NOMINATION AND SAVE SARAH
BETH.

22:24.172 --> 22:25.344
I DON'T KNOW WHO WOULD
WANT TO DO THAT, BUT THEY

22:25.379 --> 22:27.241
WOULD BECOME MY NEW
TARGET.

22:27.275 --> 22:29.379
HEY!

22:29.413 --> 22:30.655
SORRY.

22:30.689 --> 22:32.551
I KNOW.

22:32.586 --> 22:35.137
WE'RE NOT MORTAL
ENEMIES.

22:35.172 --> 22:38.827
IT IS NOT REALLY A
SURPRISE TO SEE MYSELF

22:38.862 --> 22:40.000
NOMINATED.

22:40.034 --> 22:43.068
TIFF TIFFANY AND I SPOKE, AND
WE KNOW IT MAKES THE MOST

22:43.103 --> 22:46.517
SENSE FOR ME TO BE ON THE
BLOCK.

22:46.551 --> 22:57.758
I WATCHED BRITINI AND
ZAHA LOSE, BUT THAT DOES

22:57.793 --> 23:00.689
NOT MAKE THIS FEEL ANY
LESS PAINFUL.

23:00.724 --> 23:06.137
NOBODY LIKES DUOS IN
"BIG BROTHER," BUT I CAN'T

23:06.172 --> 23:07.137
SIT HERE BUT HURT.

23:07.172 --> 23:09.068
I'M NOMINATED NEXT TO
KYLAND.

23:09.103 --> 23:14.827
BUT THE LAST TIME I WAS
NOMINNOMINATED, I HAD ANOTHER

23:14.862 --> 23:17.517
CHANCE TO POSSIBLY COME
OFF THE BLOCK, AND MAYBE

23:17.551 --> 23:20.689
KYLAND COULD COME OFF WITH
ME DUE TO THE COIN OF

23:20.724 --> 23:21.448
DESTINY.

23:21.482 --> 23:27.034
SO HOPE IS NOT COMPLETELY
LOST.

23:28.068 --> 23:30.551
I'M STILL TRYING TO GET
OUT OF THAT KITCHEN.

23:30.586 --> 23:33.172
I WAS, LIKE, I HOPE NOBODY
SEES ME.

23:33.206 --> 23:34.689
LET ME HIDE HERE.

23:34.724 --> 23:35.482
I KNOW.

23:35.517 --> 23:36.931
I KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

23:36.965 --> 23:42.448
YOU GUYS ARE A POWERFUL
DUO TO ME.

23:42.482 --> 23:44.827
KYLAND SPECIFICALLY.

23:44.862 --> 23:49.103
YOU JUST HAPPEN TO BE VERY
CLOSE TO HIM.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.793
I KNOW YOU WOULD SAVE HIM.

23:50.827 --> 23:53.034
I KNOW YOU WOULD FIGHT FOR
HIM, SO THE BEST

23:53.068 --> 23:56.448
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO HAVE
A SHOT IS FOR HIM TO NOT

23:56.482 --> 23:57.448
HAVE THE HELP.

23:57.482 --> 24:01.172
I THINK THAT MAKES
COMPLETE SENSE IF KYLAND

24:01.206 --> 24:03.034
IS YOUR TARGET.

24:03.068 --> 24:06.448
THEN IT ONLY MAKES SENSE
FOR ME TO GO UP BESIDE

24:06.482 --> 24:07.137
HIM.

24:07.172 --> 24:10.758
I AM LYING TO SARAH
BETH.

24:10.793 --> 24:12.896
OBVIOUSLY SARAH BETH IS MY
TARGET, BUT I DON'T WANT

24:12.931 --> 24:16.000
TO LET HER KNOW THAT SO
SHE DOESN'T FIGHT SO HARD.

24:16.034 --> 24:20.172
IS IT GOING TO BE KNOWN
KYLAND IS THE TARGET?

24:20.206 --> 24:22.793
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO
ANYONE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

24:22.827 --> 24:25.034
WHAT MY GOAL IS AT THE END
OF THIS WEEK.

24:25.068 --> 24:28.827
I REALLY APPRECIATE HOW
CANDID YOU'VE BEEN ABOUT

24:28.862 --> 24:29.931
THE WHOLE SITUATION.

24:29.965 --> 24:32.896
EVEN IF IT IS NOT THE NEWS
THAT I WANTED, IT IS STILL

24:32.931 --> 24:36.068
BETTER TO KNOW WHAT IS
GOING ON THAN TO FEEL LIKE

24:36.103 --> 24:38.344
YOU'RE IN THE DARK, AND
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO

24:38.379 --> 24:39.413
THAT, SO I DO APPRECIATE
THAT.

24:39.448 --> 24:43.137
IF IT IS GOING TO BE ME
OR KYLAND, OBVIOUSLY I

24:43.172 --> 24:45.586
WOULD RATHER IT BE HIM
THAN ME.

24:45.620 --> 24:48.793
TIFFANY COULD BE LYING TO
ME TO TRY TO MAKE ME

24:48.827 --> 24:51.758
COMFORTABLE, BUT EVEN IF
KYLAND IS THE TARGET, IT

24:51.793 --> 24:54.689
DOESN'T MEAN THE REST OF
THE HOUSE IS GOING TO DO

24:54.724 --> 24:55.482
WHAT SHE WANTS.

24:55.517 --> 25:01.172
SO I'M DEFINITELY STILL IN
DANGER.

25:01.206 --> 25:03.379
HEY!

25:03.413 --> 25:05.862
HOUSEGUESTS!

25:05.896 --> 25:09.103
I NEED EVERYONE TOGETHER
IN THE LIVING ROOM!

25:16.758 --> 25:21.241
THE HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM
IS ABOUT TO OPEN FOR THE

25:21.275 --> 25:22.724
LAST TIME.

25:22.758 --> 25:24.586
SINCE THE DESH WE VETO IN
CHOPPING BLOCK ROULETTE

25:24.620 --> 25:27.344
HAS BEEN WON, BOTH GAMES
ARE NOW CLOSED.

25:27.379 --> 25:30.068
THIS WEEK IF YOU HAVE
ENOUGH B.B. BUCKS IN YOUR

25:30.103 --> 25:33.655
BANK ACCOUNT, YOU CAN TRY
TO WIN THE COIN OF

25:33.689 --> 25:34.586
DESTINY.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.862
THE WINNER OF THIS
POWERFUL COIN WILL FORCE

25:36.896 --> 25:39.034
THE CURRENT HEAD OF
HOUSEHOLD INTO A COIN FLIP

25:39.068 --> 25:41.000
FOR POWER.

25:41.034 --> 25:45.137
IF THE WINNER OF THE COIN
CALLS THIS TOSS CORRECTLY,

25:45.172 --> 25:48.793
THEY WILL IMMEDIATELY
DETHRONE ME AND CRET SECRETLY

25:48.827 --> 25:51.517
TAKE OVER ALL OF MY POWERS
FOR THE WEEK.

25:51.551 --> 25:54.137
THAT MEANS, SARAH BETH AND
KYLAND, YOU COULD BE

25:54.172 --> 25:55.137
REMOVED FROM THE CHOPPING
BLOCK.

25:55.172 --> 25:57.896
THE NEW HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD WILL BE

25:57.931 --> 26:00.379
COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS,
WHICH MEANS THEY'LL NAME

26:00.413 --> 26:05.206
THEIR NOMINEES IN SECRET
AND PLAY AS H.O.H. FROM

26:05.241 --> 26:06.206
THE SHADOWS.

26:06.241 --> 26:09.586
XAVIER, SINCE YOU ARE
NOMINATED AS AS A RESULT

26:09.620 --> 26:14.448
OF TAKING A PUNISHMENT,
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU WILL

26:14.482 --> 26:18.034
NOT BE REMOVED FROM THE
BLOCK IF I'M DETHRONED.

26:18.068 --> 26:21.275
AS THE DETHRONED H.O.H., I
WILL BE SAFE, BUT EVERYONE

26:21.310 --> 26:23.793
ELSE IS ELIGIBLE TO BE
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION

26:23.827 --> 26:24.862
THIS WEEK.

26:24.896 --> 26:27.758
IT IS NOW TIME TO HEAD TO
THE HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM.

26:27.793 --> 26:30.655
WE'LL GO IN ONE BY ONE AND
FIND OUT HOW MUCH AMERICA

26:30.689 --> 26:37.551
GAVE US THIS WEEK, AND HOW
MANY B.B. BUCKS ARE IN OR

26:37.586 --> 26:38.620
ENVELOPES.

26:38.655 --> 26:39.689
OF ALL OF THE POWERS IN

26:39.724 --> 26:42.448
THE HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM,
THE COIN OF DESTINY IS THE

26:42.482 --> 26:43.586
BIGGEST ONE YET.

26:43.620 --> 26:47.793
I'M JUST HOPING THAT
WHOEVER WINS DOES NOT

26:47.827 --> 26:50.689
DERAIL MY PLANS OF SENDING
SARAH BETH HOME THIS WEEK.

26:50.724 --> 26:53.000
SARAH BETH HAS GOT TO GO!

27:08.068 --> 27:09.724
AZAH, WELCOME BACK TO

27:09.758 --> 27:11.206
THE HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM.

27:11.241 --> 27:12.931
IN ADDITION TO THE B.B.

27:12.965 --> 27:20.586
BUCKS, WE HAVE A RANDOMLY
SHOWS ENVELOPE THAT

27:20.620 --> 27:23.034
CONTAINS 50 OR 100 B.B.

27:23.068 --> 27:23.689
BUCKS.

27:23.724 --> 27:25.275
IF YOU HAVE 250 B.B.

27:25.310 --> 27:29.448
BUCKS, YOU CAN COMPETE TO
WIN B.B.'s COIN OF

27:29.482 --> 27:30.586
DESTINY.

27:30.620 --> 27:33.517
IF SUCCESSFUL, THEY BECOME
THE NEW SECRET H.O.H.

27:33.551 --> 27:36.344
AND THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO
OVERTHROW TIFFANY'S

27:36.379 --> 27:38.965
NOMINATION.

27:39.000 --> 27:42.724
BUT THEY WILL ALSO BE
INELIGIBLE TO BE H.O.H.

27:42.758 --> 27:43.793
NEXT WEEK.

27:43.827 --> 27:47.241
PLEASE SCAN YOUR CARD
TO SEE HOW MANY B.B. BUCKS

27:47.275 --> 27:48.724
AMERICA GIVES TO YOU.

27:48.758 --> 27:50.413
YOU RECEIVED 50 B.B.

27:50.448 --> 27:51.000
BUCKS.

27:51.034 --> 27:52.068
HEY, AMERICA, REALLY?

27:52.103 --> 27:55.068
PLEASE OPEN YOUR
ENVELOPE.

27:55.103 --> 27:57.586
YOU RECEIVED 50 B.B.

27:57.620 --> 27:58.413
BUCKS.

27:58.448 --> 28:01.000
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 200
B.B. BUCKS.

28:01.034 --> 28:04.275
SORRY, YOU DO NOT HAVE
ENOUGH B.B. BUCKS TO PLAY

28:04.310 --> 28:05.000
COIN OF DESTINY.

28:05.034 --> 28:06.896
ALL RIGHTY.

28:06.931 --> 28:10.103
YOU RECEIVED 75 B.B.

28:10.137 --> 28:10.724
BUCKS.

28:10.758 --> 28:11.620
COOL.

28:11.655 --> 28:13.965
PLEASE OPEN YOUR
ENVELOPE.

28:14.000 --> 28:15.034
50.

28:15.068 --> 28:19.793
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 125
B.B. BUCKS.

28:19.827 --> 28:20.413
SHUCKS!

28:20.448 --> 28:23.068
YOU'VE RECEIVED 75 B.B.

28:23.103 --> 28:23.586
BUCKS.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.655
THANKS, AMERICA.

28:26.689 --> 28:28.103
OH, 100!

28:28.137 --> 28:32.344
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 175
B.B. BUCKS.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.448
NOT BAD.

28:33.482 --> 28:37.655
SORRY, YOU DO NOT HAVE
ENOUGH B.B. BUCKS TO PLAY

28:37.689 --> 28:38.275
COIN OF DESTINY.

28:38.310 --> 28:39.379
THAT'S OKAY.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.862
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
REAL QUICK.

28:41.896 --> 28:42.896
OKAY.

28:42.931 --> 28:45.620
SINCE THE WINNER OF
QUEEN OF DESTINY WOULD ACT

28:45.655 --> 28:48.413
AS THE SECRET H.O.H., THEY
WOULD NO LONGER BE

28:48.448 --> 28:51.758
ELIGIBLE TO PLAY IN NEXT
WEEK'S H.O.H. COMPETITION.

28:51.793 --> 28:57.206
I WOULD LIKE CLAIRE TO WIN
QUEEN OF DESTINY.

28:57.241 --> 29:00.172
THAT ENSURES ALL THREE
MEMBERS OF THE COOKOUT

29:00.206 --> 29:05.172
WILL BE PLAYING IN NEXT
WEEK'S GAME.

29:05.206 --> 29:07.137
SHE IS INELIGIBLE.

29:07.172 --> 29:10.965
I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT
IN THE DECISION TO HAVE

29:11.000 --> 29:11.827
CLAIRE PLAY.

29:11.862 --> 29:15.103
SHE HAS BEEN BY MY SIDE
SINCE DAY ONE.

29:15.137 --> 29:16.482
SHE WOULD KEEP MY
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.

29:16.517 --> 29:20.586
I WOULD RATHER BE ABLE TO
PLAY IN THIS UPCOMING

29:20.620 --> 29:23.862
H.O.H. BECAUSE, DUH, I
COULD BE H.O.H. TWO WEEKS

29:23.896 --> 29:25.206
IN A ROW.

29:25.241 --> 29:26.275
WHO WOULDN'T WANT THAT?

29:26.310 --> 29:32.862
YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
AMERICA WHO WATCHES THIS

29:32.896 --> 29:33.862
SHOW.

29:33.896 --> 29:35.068
OFTENTIMES AMERICA ROOTS
FOR THE PERSON WHO IS

29:35.103 --> 29:40.620
TARGETED BY THE WHOLE
HOUSE.

29:40.655 --> 29:44.137
HER CHANCES OF GETTING
100 ARE PROBABLY 50% FROM

29:44.172 --> 29:45.034
THE ENVELOPE.

29:45.068 --> 29:46.931
SO THEN EVERYBODY IS
GOING TO PLAY.

29:46.965 --> 29:50.758
I AM GOING TO PLAY
BECAUSE I DON'T ANYBODY TO

29:50.793 --> 29:52.517
DO ANYTHING MESSING AROUND
WITH YOUR WEEK.

29:52.551 --> 29:56.758
BUT THEN YOU'RE NOT
GOING TOB TO BE ABLE TO --

29:56.793 --> 29:57.448
THAT'S FINE.

29:57.482 --> 30:00.413
I'M READY TO SEE MY 50.

30:00.448 --> 30:03.172
YOU'VE RECEIVED 100
B.B. BUCKS.

30:03.206 --> 30:05.586
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 300
B.B. BUCKS.

30:05.620 --> 30:09.172
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY
COIN OF DESTINY?

30:09.206 --> 30:15.379
I WOULD SL LIKE TO DECLINE
TO PLAY COIN OF DESTINY.

30:15.413 --> 30:19.379
YOU'VE RECEIVED 50 B.B.

30:19.413 --> 30:20.206
BUCKS.

30:20.241 --> 30:21.172
100 B.B. BUCKS.

30:21.206 --> 30:25.206
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 200
B.B. BUCKS.

30:25.241 --> 30:28.931
FANTASTIC.

30:28.965 --> 30:33.172
YOU'VE RECEIVED 100
B.B. BUCKS.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.310
AHH!

30:34.344 --> 30:38.413
THANK YOU, AMERICA!

30:38.448 --> 30:44.931
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 225
B.B. BUCKS.

30:44.965 --> 30:48.413
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF I
COULD PLAY IN COIN OF

30:48.448 --> 30:52.034
DESTINY, BUT THAT MEANS I
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE 100

30:52.068 --> 30:55.206
B.B. BUCKS IN MY ENVELOPE,
AND AMERICA WOULD HAVE HAD

30:55.241 --> 30:57.482
TO HAVE GIVEN ME 100 B.B.

30:57.517 --> 30:58.586
BUCKS.

30:58.620 --> 31:01.931
I'M PRETTY SURE AMERICA IS
HAPPY I'M IN DANGER, SO NO

31:01.965 --> 31:04.413
GLIMMER OF HOPE, BUT RIGHT
NOW THERE IS A CHANCE.

31:04.448 --> 31:06.793
YOU'VE RECEIVED 50 B.B.

31:06.827 --> 31:10.517
BUCKS.

31:10.551 --> 31:12.413
YOU'VE RECEIVED 100 B.B.

31:12.448 --> 31:13.655
BUCKS.

31:13.689 --> 31:16.034
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 200
B.B. BUCKS.

31:16.068 --> 31:18.931
THANK YOU.

31:18.965 --> 31:24.310
I NEED YOU TO BE ABLE
TO BE HERE NEXT WEEK.

31:24.344 --> 31:29.000
IF YOU WIN, THEN YOU WON'T
BE ABLE TO PLAY NEXT WEEK.

31:29.034 --> 31:31.689
SO I'M OKAY IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO PLAY.

31:31.724 --> 31:37.034
BECAUSE IF SHE WINS, SHE
CANNOT PLAY IN H.O.H. NEXT

31:37.068 --> 31:38.034
WEEK.

31:38.068 --> 31:41.068
AND WE NEED THAT, SO I
DON'T REALLY WANT YOU TO

31:41.103 --> 31:44.344
PLAY BECAUSE YOU CAN BEAT
HER.

31:44.379 --> 31:48.068
DEREK X., YOU'VE
RECEIVED 75 B.B. BUCKS.

31:48.103 --> 31:49.689
THANK YOU, AMERICA.

31:49.724 --> 31:53.586
PLEASE OPEN YOUR
ENVELOPE.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.034
AHH!

31:54.068 --> 31:54.620
100.

31:54.655 --> 31:58.172
YOU RECEIVED 100 B.B.

31:58.206 --> 31:59.551
BUCKS.

31:59.586 --> 32:01.448
YOU ALSO WON 100 B.B.

32:01.482 --> 32:06.137
BUCKS IN THE DOMINO EFFECT
VETO COMPETITION.

32:06.172 --> 32:10.551
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 425
B.B. BUCKS.

32:10.586 --> 32:12.724
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY
COIN OF DESTINY?

32:12.758 --> 32:15.724
I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY
THE COIN OF DESTINY.

32:15.758 --> 32:18.896
I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

32:18.931 --> 32:22.206
TO PLAY IN COIN OF
DESTINY, EVEN THOUGH I

32:22.241 --> 32:24.103
DON'T NEED TO PLAY.

32:24.137 --> 32:25.137
I'M GOING TO.

32:25.172 --> 32:29.551
I'M GOING TO PLAY JUST SO
IT SHOWS THAT, HEY, I

32:29.586 --> 32:30.482
TRIED TO WIN.

32:30.517 --> 32:33.482
COIN OF DESTINY IS A
GAME OF SKILL AND

32:33.517 --> 32:34.586
PRECISION.

32:34.620 --> 32:38.586
ON GO, ROLL THE GOLD COIN
DOWN THE LANE TOWARDS THE

32:38.620 --> 32:39.655
OPENINGS AT THE END.

32:39.689 --> 32:43.103
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES TO
RACK UP AS MANY POINTS AS

32:43.137 --> 32:44.137
POSSIBLE.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.793
YOUR SCORE WILL BE THE
TOTAL NUMBER OF COINS YOU

32:46.827 --> 32:50.758
LAND BEFORE THE EXPIRATION
OF YOUR TWO-MINUTE CLOCK.

32:50.793 --> 32:53.827
THE WINNER OF COIN OF
DESTINY WILL BE THE

32:53.862 --> 32:55.103
HOUSEGUEST WITH THE
HIGHEST SCORE AT THE END

32:55.137 --> 32:58.034
OF THE TWO MINUTES.

32:58.068 --> 33:02.413
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY COIN
OF DESTINY?

33:02.448 --> 33:05.931
YES.

33:05.965 --> 33:08.413
THE COIN OF DESTINY

33:08.448 --> 33:11.793
GAME IS ALL ABOUT BEING
PRECISE.

33:11.827 --> 33:17.586
I NEED TO AIM AND ROLL
GOLD COINS DOWN THE LANE

33:17.620 --> 33:18.724
INTO THREE DIFFERENT
SLOTS.

33:18.758 --> 33:21.931
THE PLAYER WHO LANDS THE
MOST COINS IN THE SLOT IN

33:21.965 --> 33:25.241
TWO MINUTES WILL WIN THE
COIN OF DESTINY.

33:25.275 --> 33:30.724
BUT I AM GOING TO TAKE MY
SWEET-ASS TIME BECAUSE I

33:30.758 --> 33:32.137
AM DEFINITELY THROWING
THIS COMPETITION.

33:32.172 --> 33:38.689
I'M GOING WITH MY GUT.

33:38.724 --> 33:43.586
OH, OKAY.

33:44.206 --> 33:49.034
THAT'S COOL.

33:49.068 --> 33:52.206
I GET A SCORE OF ONE.

33:52.241 --> 33:57.241
I FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE
PERFECT THROWING-IT SCORE

33:57.275 --> 34:03.931
BECAUSE AS LONG AS SOMEONE
GETS A TWO OR BETTER, I

34:03.965 --> 34:05.758
SUCCESSFULLY THREW THIS.

34:05.793 --> 34:06.724
SO CROWN ME.

34:06.758 --> 34:10.241
I TRIED MY BEST, THAT'S
ALL I CAN DO.

34:10.275 --> 34:13.000
I FEEL PRETTY SAFE WITH

34:13.034 --> 34:16.275
TIFFANY AS H.O.H.

34:16.310 --> 34:19.793
YOU'VE RECEIVED 100
B.B. BUCKS.

34:19.827 --> 34:20.862
AHH!

34:20.896 --> 34:23.413
BUT BECAUSE OF THE COIN
OF DESTINY, THERE IS THE

34:23.448 --> 34:25.482
CHANCE THAT SOMEONE COULD
OVETHROW HER AND PUT ME

34:25.517 --> 34:27.241
ON THE BLOCK.

34:27.275 --> 34:30.482
OH, THANK GOODNESS!

34:30.517 --> 34:33.931
SO I WOULD LOVE TO
COMPETE AND BE ABLE TO

34:33.965 --> 34:36.689
CONTROL MY OWN FATE AND
NOT LEAVE IT UP TO SOME

34:36.724 --> 34:39.689
OTHER SECRET H.O.H.

34:39.724 --> 34:41.103
YOU'VE RECEIVED 50 B.B.

34:41.137 --> 34:41.551
BUCKS.

34:41.586 --> 34:43.241
YEP.

34:43.275 --> 34:46.620
YOUR GRAND TOTAL IS 250
B.B. BUCKS.

34:46.655 --> 34:49.275
YOU KNOW, THIS ONE
ISN'T REALLY TOUGH.

34:49.310 --> 34:52.137
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO
MESS WITH TIFF'S WEEK.

34:52.172 --> 34:58.206
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THE
COIN OF DESTINY.

34:58.241 --> 35:04.275
FAST AND

35:04.310 --> 35:07.482
FURIOUS.

35:07.517 --> 35:08.931
QUANTITY OVER QUALITY
HERE.

35:08.965 --> 35:12.551
IF I CAN JUST SEND A TON
OF THEM DOWN, THE CHANCES

35:12.586 --> 35:16.275
THAT ONE OF THEM WILL GO
IN SEEMS PRETTY GOOD TO

35:16.310 --> 35:17.275
ME.

35:17.551 --> 35:20.172
I FINALLY GET ONE COIN

35:20.206 --> 35:24.448
IN, BUT IT'S WAY HARDER
THAN IT LOOKS.

35:24.482 --> 35:29.931
I CAN FEEL THE TWO

35:29.965 --> 35:31.724
MINUTES SLIPPING AWAY.

35:31.758 --> 35:36.827
I NEED TO START PICKING UP
THE PACE, SENDING THESE

35:36.862 --> 35:40.620
COINS FLYING BECAUSE ONE
COIN IS NOT GOING TO CUT

35:40.655 --> 35:41.413
IT HERE.

35:50.103 --> 35:52.793
IF I WIN THIS COIN OF
DESTINY COMPETITION, I

35:52.827 --> 35:57.620
HAVE A 50/50 CHANCE OF
DETHRONE TIFFANY AND

35:57.655 --> 35:59.413
BECOMING THE SECRET H.O.H.

35:59.448 --> 36:04.896
I HAVE ONE COIN IN SO FAR,
BUT THE TIME IS TICKING.

36:04.931 --> 36:11.310
C'MON, BABY, LET'S ROLL!

36:11.344 --> 36:15.206
WHAT THE HECK?

36:15.241 --> 36:15.551
DANG!

36:15.586 --> 36:17.413
SO CLOSE.

36:17.448 --> 36:21.758
FOR SENDING THAT MANY
COINS DOWN THERE, THREE

36:21.793 --> 36:23.551
DOESN'T SEEM THAT GOOD.

36:23.586 --> 36:26.551
HOPEFULLY I HAVE ENOUGH
SCORE SO I CAN PREVENT

36:26.586 --> 36:30.586
SOMEONE ELSE FROM TOPPLING
TIFFANY'S H.O.H.

36:30.620 --> 36:37.448
COIN OF DESTINY, PLEASE
DON'T FAIL ME.

36:39.206 --> 36:41.724
HOUSEGUESTS, I NEED
EVERYONE TOGETHER IN THE

36:41.758 --> 36:43.172
DINING ROOM.

36:43.206 --> 36:43.793
OH!

36:43.827 --> 36:45.689
OH, THE DINING ROOM.

36:45.724 --> 36:47.931
THERE'S A DINING ROOM?

36:47.965 --> 36:50.172
I'M JUST HOPING THAT
THE PLAN WORKS.

36:50.206 --> 36:53.310
WE REALLY NEED CLAIRE TO
WIN BECAUSE WE NEED EVERY

36:53.344 --> 36:56.793
SINGLE MEMBER OF THE
COOKOUT PLAYING IN NEXT

36:56.827 --> 36:58.241
WEEK'S H.O.H. COMPETITION.

36:58.275 --> 37:01.241
IF THE WRONG PERSON WINS,
THAT WILL REALLY THROW

37:01.275 --> 37:03.344
THINGS FOR A LOOP NEXT
WEEK.

37:03.379 --> 37:07.724
HOUSEGUESTS, THE COIN
OF DESTINY WAS PLAYED IN

37:07.758 --> 37:10.379
THE HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM,
AND WITH A SCORE OF THREE,

37:10.413 --> 37:15.275
THERE IS A WINNER.

37:15.655 --> 37:17.275
THIS WAS ME.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.482
I FINALLY WON SOMETHING.

37:18.517 --> 37:21.310
I THINK I HAVE A 50%
CHANCE RIGHT NOW OF

37:21.344 --> 37:25.172
BECOMING THE NEW H.O.H.

37:25.206 --> 37:26.620
ANONYMOUSLY.

37:26.655 --> 37:31.172
TIFFANY, IT IS TIME TO
FIND OUT IF YOU'LL BE

37:31.206 --> 37:33.793
OVERTHROWN OR RETAIN YOUR
H.O.H. POWER.

37:33.827 --> 37:37.034
IT IS TIME TO FLIP THE
COIN.

37:39.793 --> 37:40.758
OH!

37:40.793 --> 37:42.034
THAT'S SICK.

37:42.068 --> 37:44.206
YEAH, IT IS.

37:44.241 --> 37:50.448
HEADS IS THE SIDE OF
THE CROWN.

37:50.482 --> 37:56.172
TIFFANY, AS H.O.H., PLEASE
PLACE A COIN ON THE

37:56.206 --> 37:59.689
FLIPPER.

37:59.724 --> 38:01.448
WHILE IN THE HIGH

38:01.482 --> 38:06.068
ROLLERS' ROOM, THE WINNER
CHOSE HEADS.

38:06.103 --> 38:07.034
OH!

38:07.068 --> 38:12.068
TIFFANY, WHENEVER
YOU'RE READY.

38:31.793 --> 38:36.034
THE COIN HAS LANDED ON
HEADS.

38:36.068 --> 38:41.448
I'VE BEEN DETHRONED.

38:41.482 --> 38:45.241
NOW THAT TIFFANY IS
DETHRONED, WE HAVE NO IDEA

38:45.275 --> 38:46.931
WHO HAS ALL OF THE POWER
THIS WEEK.

38:46.965 --> 38:50.137
THE ONLY PERSON I WOULD
100% TRUST IN THIS HOUSE

38:50.172 --> 38:52.724
IS XAVIER, AND I KNOW HE
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

38:52.758 --> 38:54.482
TO PLAY, JUST LIKE MYSELF.

38:54.517 --> 38:56.793
SO I'M PLAYING THAT
WHOEVER IT IS DOES NOT

38:56.827 --> 38:59.517
TAKE A SHOT AT ME.

38:59.551 --> 39:02.206
TIFFANY, ALTHOUGH YOU
ARE STILL SAFE FOR THE

39:02.241 --> 39:04.482
WEEK, SOMEONE ELSE IS
SECRETLY RUNNING THE HEAD

39:04.517 --> 39:05.482
OF HOUSEHOLD.

39:05.517 --> 39:08.206
SINCE YOU HAVE BEEN
DETHRONED YOU'RE ELIGIBLE

39:08.241 --> 39:12.034
TO VOTE THIS WEEK AND
COMPETE IN THE NEXT HEAD

39:12.068 --> 39:16.241
OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

39:18.103 --> 39:21.413
WE ARE NOW OFF THE

39:21.448 --> 39:22.482
BLOCK.

39:22.517 --> 39:25.241
WE COULD GO RIGHT BACK UP,
BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE

39:25.275 --> 39:28.724
ANONYMOUS H.O.H. WILL SEE
THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO

39:28.758 --> 39:32.241
TAKE OUT A DIFFERENT
TARGET WITH NO BLOOD ON

39:32.275 --> 39:34.034
THEIR HANDS.

39:34.068 --> 39:35.689
AND MAYBE KYLAND AND
MYSELF WILL BE SAFE.

39:35.724 --> 39:40.517
IT IS TIME TO FIND OUT
WHO THE SECRET H.O.H.

39:40.551 --> 39:43.413
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION.

39:43.448 --> 39:48.034
KYLAND, SARAH BETH, YOU
ARE OFF THE BLOCK FOR NOW.

39:48.068 --> 40:01.689
THE SECRET H.O.H.'S FIRST
NOMINEE IS...KYLAND.

40:01.724 --> 40:12.172
THEIR SECOND NOMINEE IS
IS...SARAH BETH.

40:12.206 --> 40:16.172
THE SECRET H.O.H.'S
NOMINEES ARE LOCKED, AND

40:16.206 --> 40:23.241
THE HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM IS
OFFICIALLY CLOSED.

40:23.275 --> 40:26.172
I DO THINK THAT KYLAND

40:26.206 --> 40:33.103
OR I WILL BE GOING HOME
THIS WEEK.

40:33.137 --> 40:35.517
UM...I DON'T REALLY SEE A
WAY OUT OF IT.

40:35.551 --> 40:39.413
EVEN SOMEONE WHO HAS AN
ANONYMOUS H.O.H. IS STILL

40:39.448 --> 40:42.000
CHOOSING TO TARGET US.

40:42.034 --> 40:45.034
IT SUCKS.

40:45.068 --> 40:45.758
OH!

40:45.793 --> 40:47.620
THEY JUST DETHRONED THE
QUEEN.

40:47.655 --> 40:51.931
BUT WHOEVER DETHRONED
ME DIDN'T CHANGE MY NOMS.

40:51.965 --> 40:52.965
THEY'RE STILL THE SAME.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.758
SO THE ONLY THING THAT CAN
RUIN MY PLAN NOW IS IF

40:57.793 --> 41:00.206
SARAH BETH WINS THE POWER
OF VETO AND TAKES HERSELF

41:00.241 --> 41:01.206
OFF THE BLOCK.

41:01.241 --> 41:03.655
I AM FIGHTING WITH
EVERYTHING IN ME TO MAKE

41:03.689 --> 41:06.241
SURE SARAH BETH DOES NOT
WIN.

41:06.275 --> 41:10.517
NO MORE LIES, SARAH BETH,
THIS IS IT.

41:10.551 --> 41:14.724
YES, YES, YES, YES,
YES!

41:14.758 --> 41:17.724
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS NOT
HOW I THOUGHT MY FIRST

41:17.758 --> 41:20.172
H.O.H. WIN WOULD GO, BUT I
WILL TAKE IT!

41:20.206 --> 41:24.275
I FINALLY HAVE SOME
AGENCY HERE.

41:24.310 --> 41:27.206
I ELECTED TO KEEP THE
NOMINATIONS THE SAME

41:27.241 --> 41:32.103
BECAUSE I DO RESPECTIVE
NE'S H.O.H.

41:32.137 --> 41:36.068
I WANT ONE OF KYLAND'S,
SARAH BETH, OR EVEN XAVIER

41:36.103 --> 41:40.137
TO LEAVE AT THIS WEEK.

41:40.172 --> 41:42.241
WITH THREE
NOMINEES ON THE BLOCK AND

41:42.275 --> 41:44.689
A SECRET HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD
IN PLAY, THE VETO IS MORE

41:44.724 --> 41:45.758
CRUCIAL THAN EVER.

41:45.793 --> 41:48.068
WHO WILL WIN THE GOLDEN
POWER?

41:48.103 --> 41:51.931
FIND OUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AT 8:00, 7:00 CENTRAL ON

41:51.965 --> 41:54.000
"BIG BROTHER"!
