-Really?
-Yeah.

-You're not just saying that?
-No. It's all Lois.

11:34.820 --> 11:37.614
If only I'd met you first,
but what are you gonna do?

11:37.698 --> 11:40.951
-So Lois is the problem, huh?
-Yeah. But it's not her fault.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.871
She doesn't want to see me
fall in with a tough crowd again.

we could still be friends, right?
