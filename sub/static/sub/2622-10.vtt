WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:04.586
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04.963 --> 00:06.755
Sorry I'm late.
Did I miss anything?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.675
Joey stuffing fifteen Oreos
in his mouth.

00:10.969 --> 00:12.011
Fifteen?

00:12.262 --> 00:14.179
Your personal best! Ha, ha.

00:14.931 --> 00:16.015
Mm-mm. Mm.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.436
Where were you?

00:20.729 --> 00:21.770
On a date.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.440
I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.568
- Which museum?
- How'd you meet her?

00:27.944 --> 00:29.862
No. Answer his.

00:30.780 --> 00:32.948
We were at the back of the train.

00:33.199 --> 00:36.535
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...

00:36.786 --> 00:40.748
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.

00:40.957 --> 00:44.251
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?

00:44.669 --> 00:47.046
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.632
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.261
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.806
That joke would have killed
in Albany.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.726
Done! I did it.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.437
Who's stupid now?

01:54.614 --> 01:57.449
Look! They're lighting
the big Christmas tree tonight.

01:57.742 --> 01:59.660
Um, that paper is two weeks old.

02:01.538 --> 02:04.331
Who keeps leaving old newspapers
in the trash?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.627
I really wanted
to take Kathy to this.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.965
At least you have somebody
to miss stuff with.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.384
I hate being alone
this time of year.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.761
Next it's Valentine's Day...

02:18.012 --> 02:19.888
...then my birthday, then bang!

02:20.181 --> 02:22.891
Then they're lighting
that damn tree again.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.603
I want somebody!

02:29.691 --> 02:32.317
You know, I want a man!

02:37.073 --> 02:41.368
It doesn't even have to be
a big relationship. Just a fling!

02:41.619 --> 02:44.746
I didn't think girls ever
just wanted a fling.

02:45.039 --> 02:49.001
Let me tell you, it's been
a long time since I've been flung.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.671
I know what I'm giving you
for Christmas.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.011
There are nice guys in my office.
Want me to set you up?

02:59.220 --> 03:00.429
Yeah.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.808
I've been single a long time.
Why haven't you offered before?

03:05.059 --> 03:07.686
I have a girlfriend.
I'm happy.

03:08.188 --> 03:12.566
I no longer go out of my way
to stop others from being happy.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.735
Okay.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.528
No accountants.

03:16.905 --> 03:20.199
And no one from "legal."
I don't like boring jobs.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.994
And Ross was what?
A lion tamer?

03:28.124 --> 03:29.499
What's wrong, Mon?

03:29.792 --> 03:32.127
Everybody at work still hates me.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.503
I was making headway.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.924
Everyone was smiling at me,
and then I get off work...

03:37.133 --> 03:40.344
...and find out they wrote this
on my chef's hat.

03:44.057 --> 03:48.143
Maybe they meant to write
"Quiet, Bitch."

03:52.815 --> 03:54.608
What's the matter?

03:55.485 --> 03:57.444
Fine! Just trying to be nice.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.824
I haven't been picked on this much
since kindergarten.

04:03.034 --> 04:07.037
And they brought in someone from
junior high to do the see-saw with me.

04:09.791 --> 04:11.541
Aw.

04:13.127 --> 04:16.838
They're trying to make me quit.
If it were any other job, I would.

04:17.005 --> 04:19.007
But I've waited for this
my whole life.

04:19.550 --> 04:23.053
Wait, you're the boss.
Yell at them. Or fire them!

04:23.680 --> 04:27.933
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm not good at confrontation.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.518
You know what you can do?

04:29.811 --> 04:33.021
I read about this director,
Orson Welles...

04:33.314 --> 04:37.234
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.195
Then they would all know who was boss.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.533
I'm not doing anything.
Why not fire me?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.204
It's a good idea.
Can you waiter?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.123
Good enough to get fired.

04:52.166 --> 04:53.917
All right. You're hired!

04:54.502 --> 04:55.544
Hey!

04:56.421 --> 05:01.425
That's why I got fired last week!
Does Orson Welles direct commercials?

05:06.681 --> 05:07.723
Yes.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.777
I say, Drew?
Are you seeing anybody right now?

05:21.362 --> 05:23.071
I'm not asking for me.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.992
I'm not gay.
I'm not asking you out.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.869
I'm not gay.

05:29.370 --> 05:31.288
I didn't think you were gay.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.040
I do now.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.420
My friend, Rachel,
wants to be set up.

05:38.796 --> 05:41.214
I just got out of
a big relationship.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.383
I'm not looking to get serious.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.970
That's okay. A fling
might be all right with her.

05:47.180 --> 05:51.558
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this "Hot Rachel"
that you took to the Christmas Party?

05:51.976 --> 05:54.311
By the way, that is her full name.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.730
Wow! I'm free for her.

05:56.939 --> 05:59.399
Wait, I didn't say I wasn't free.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.444
Let's talk it over
at the Ranger game.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.822
Hold on.
I just got a box of Cubans.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.533
I'll bring them
by your office at 5.

06:09.452 --> 06:13.622
That's a little later
than I usually stay, but sure.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.751
Before the game, we could enjoy
some eight-year-old Basil Haydens.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.837
I don't know what that is,
but let's!

06:26.344 --> 06:29.638
I'm writing a holiday song for everyone.
Do you want to hear it?

06:29.847 --> 06:31.807
- Yeah!
- Yes!

06:33.643 --> 06:34.684
Okay.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.314
Happy Hanukkah, Monica

06:41.359 --> 06:44.486
May your Christmas be snowy, Joey

06:45.071 --> 06:47.531
Happy New Year, Chandler and Ross

06:47.782 --> 06:51.034
Spin the dreidel, Rachel

06:54.789 --> 06:56.289
- Pheebs, that's great!
- Oh, yay!

06:56.541 --> 07:00.419
But you know, uh,
Rachel doesn't rhyme with dreidel.

07:01.045 --> 07:05.507
I know, but it's so hard.
Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

07:06.092 --> 07:09.010
What are you talking about?
Lots of things rhyme with Rachel:

07:09.262 --> 07:13.557
Bagel, mail, jail, bail, cable.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.225
Maypole.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.353
All good. Thanks.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.775
Um, do you, maybe, have a nickname
that's easier to rhyme?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.278
- Didn't your dad call you "Pumpkin"?
- Oh, yeah.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.073
But did he ever call you
"Budolph"?

07:33.578 --> 07:35.245
- Hello, children.
- Hey.

07:36.038 --> 07:38.957
Have I got the 50 guys for you!

07:39.709 --> 07:40.750
Really?

07:41.002 --> 07:42.752
I showed them your picture.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.964
Guys are throwing themselves at me
and giving me stuff.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.966
- Knicks tonight?
- Where are the seats?

07:48.259 --> 07:50.177
Wherever! I've got 20.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.264
Will I like any of these guys?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.391
You know, I'm going to, uh...

07:56.642 --> 07:59.060
- ...play the field a little bit more.
- Chandler...

08:00.188 --> 08:03.440
Guys are signing over
their 401 Ks to me.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.776
You work with robots?

08:10.531 --> 08:11.573
Yes.

08:13.743 --> 08:18.079
One guy, Patrick, you'll like him.
He's nice, funny and a swimmer.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.998
I like swimmers' bodies.

08:20.208 --> 08:23.001
His dad made the magnetic strip
on credit cards.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.836
I like credit cards!

08:26.464 --> 08:28.048
I'm not bad at this!

08:28.382 --> 08:30.926
- What does he do?
- He works in fine foods.

08:31.219 --> 08:35.597
- You have a fine foods division?
- It's a big company...

08:35.765 --> 08:38.892
Now, wait a second.
You make food and robots?

08:40.602 --> 08:43.730
No, the robots just work for them.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.983
All right, I'm going to work.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.528
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.863
Yeah, lady. I do!

08:52.114 --> 08:53.156
I got a problem!

08:53.407 --> 08:55.492
I'll give you a problem!

08:56.035 --> 08:57.786
What will you do?
Fire me?

08:57.995 --> 09:00.455
You bet your ass I'll fire you!

09:00.706 --> 09:02.415
See you later.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.465
I should go.
I've got a date.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.841
With who?

09:12.134 --> 09:15.136
You know the girl
who lives in Poughkeepsie?

09:15.346 --> 09:16.638
Not her.

09:17.348 --> 09:19.224
This is someone else.

09:19.475 --> 09:21.935
I can't decide between the two.

09:22.270 --> 09:26.606
The one from Poughkeepsie, though
two hours away, is pretty...

09:26.816 --> 09:29.276
...really smart and a lot of fun.

09:29.485 --> 09:33.488
But this other girl,
she lives right uptown.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.867
She's just as pretty.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.828
I guess she's smart.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.372
She's not fun.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.085
If she's no fun,
why date her at all?

09:47.336 --> 09:51.047
I want to give her a chance.
She lives so close.

09:51.716 --> 09:55.927
And, at the end of the date,
she said something that...

09:56.387 --> 09:59.222
...if she was kidding,
was very funny.

09:59.640 --> 10:04.477
If she wasn't kidding, she's not fun.
She's stupid and racist.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.356
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.693
How was your first day
at the restaurant?

10:11.902 --> 10:13.737
Damn!

10:20.703 --> 10:22.078
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.372
What happened to your fancy jacket?

10:24.582 --> 10:26.249
They baked it.

10:26.667 --> 10:27.792
I can't take this anymore.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.171
- I'm going to fire you tonight.
- You got it. Oh, oh!

10:31.714 --> 10:32.714
What are you doing?

10:33.507 --> 10:35.634
You're still on fire there.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.179
I think you got it!

10:43.726 --> 10:47.145
Chandler, you have
the best taste in men.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.440
Like father, like son.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.361
Patrick and I had such
a great time last night!

10:54.612 --> 10:56.905
This could, maybe, get serious.

10:57.365 --> 11:01.117
I thought you weren't looking
for serious. Just a fling?

11:01.369 --> 11:03.995
Well, you know, possibly.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.793
You didn't tell him that,
though, right?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.837
Uh, no?

11:14.048 --> 11:17.592
You told this guy that
I was looking for a fling?

11:17.802 --> 11:20.095
- You don't tell him that!
- Why not?

11:20.346 --> 11:22.597
I'd be thrilled if some hot girl...

11:22.765 --> 11:23.807
I see.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.812
You telling him I want a fling
and me putting out...

11:29.063 --> 11:31.940
...he's so going to get
the wrong idea!

11:36.362 --> 11:38.405
Joey, could you pass the cheese?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.283
I'd prefer you didn't call me Joey.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.912
I thought it might be fun
to try out a cool nickname.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.122
Hey, Dragon!

11:49.083 --> 11:52.377
Here's your tips
from Monday and Tuesday.

11:53.504 --> 11:55.296
There's $300 in this one.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.007
People get generous
around the holidays.

11:58.217 --> 12:01.594
And it never hurts
to wear tight trousers.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.975
Could the waiters listen
to the specials?

12:07.143 --> 12:11.020
There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish...

12:11.814 --> 12:13.273
Why is nobody writing these?

12:13.524 --> 12:14.816
We can remember them.

12:15.151 --> 12:19.195
Because you'll make up fake specials
and make me cook them?

12:19.405 --> 12:22.157
Sure, that too.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.912
Forget the specials for a minute.
Um, here's the thing...

12:29.415 --> 12:31.499
For the last two weeks I have, uh...

12:32.543 --> 12:36.337
...tried hard to create
a positive atmosphere.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.006
Can't hear you!

12:40.009 --> 12:41.926
Positive atmosphere.

12:42.136 --> 12:44.763
But I've had it up to here.

12:48.392 --> 12:51.519
From now on,
it is going to be my way...

12:52.271 --> 12:55.398
...or the highway. All right?

12:56.317 --> 12:59.152
Does anybody have
a problem with that?

13:07.870 --> 13:09.370
Hey, new guy.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.833
I said, does anybody
have a problem with that?

13:15.294 --> 13:16.961
No, ma'am.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.090
He has a name. It's Dragon.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.887
You want to know your name?
Check your hat.

13:26.138 --> 13:28.431
We did the hat, right?

13:33.020 --> 13:35.897
- What the hell just happened?
- I am so sorry.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.524
I was going to do it.

13:37.733 --> 13:41.361
But I was standing there
with $327 in one hand...

13:41.570 --> 13:44.906
...and $238 in the other.
And I was thinking...

13:45.115 --> 13:47.575
...it's been a long time since I had...

13:48.994 --> 13:51.621
...327 plus $238!

13:53.082 --> 13:56.751
We had a deal! It's why you're here.
I've got to fire you!

13:57.002 --> 13:59.420
And I got to pay rent!

14:01.924 --> 14:03.591
How about you don't fire me.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.427
Instead, I stay.
I gain their trust.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.014
They'll listen to the nice things
I say about you.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.600
What nice things?

14:12.893 --> 14:16.312
Nothing yet. They hate you,
and I want to fit in.

14:17.231 --> 14:20.650
Happy Hanukkah,
Chandler and Monica, Merry, merry...

14:20.901 --> 14:22.902
You know what, Pheebs?

14:24.029 --> 14:25.905
I'm not Jewish so...

14:26.448 --> 14:29.534
Ross doesn't decorate his tree
with floss...

14:29.785 --> 14:31.786
...but he's not complaining.

14:35.791 --> 14:37.417
Bad dream?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.252
I wasn't sleeping.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.964
What was Phoebe's song about?

14:44.341 --> 14:47.093
It's the one with the cat.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.681
I got to go.
I've got another date.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.641
Did you pick one yet?

14:53.893 --> 14:57.770
It turns out the one
from uptown was making a joke.

14:58.355 --> 15:02.150
It was a different joke.
It wasn't that funny.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.652
So I'm still torn.

15:04.987 --> 15:06.988
You don't like the one from uptown.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.991
And you're exhausted
from dating Poughkeepsie.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.076
Just end them both!

15:12.328 --> 15:14.996
Go to Poughkeepsie
and break up with her.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.998
Then break up with uptown.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.834
By the time you get home,
you're done!

15:21.337 --> 15:23.254
You're right. Thank you.

15:24.298 --> 15:27.592
I had a similar problem
when I lived in Prague.

15:28.636 --> 15:31.679
- Prague?
- So much you don't know.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.027
Chandler?

15:46.528 --> 15:48.655
Patrick just, uh, ended things with me.

15:48.864 --> 15:53.952
Did you or didn't you tell him
I wanted a serious relationship?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.245
I did! I absolutely did!

15:56.664 --> 15:58.247
You idiot!

15:58.540 --> 16:00.750
I'm sure you're right.
But why?

16:01.543 --> 16:05.880
You don't tell a guy that
you want a serious relationship.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.049
Now you scared him away!

16:08.342 --> 16:11.260
I am sorry.
I am so sorry.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.472
You should never be allowed
to talk to people!

16:15.307 --> 16:16.933
I know, I know!

16:17.184 --> 16:20.144
Now I'm right back where I started.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.896
This sucks!

16:22.106 --> 16:24.148
Being alone sucks!

16:24.858 --> 16:26.734
You'll meet somebody.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.903
You're a great catch!

16:29.154 --> 16:33.908
When I told those guys about you,
I didn't have to lie once.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.661
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.415
You graduated magna cum laude, right?

16:41.333 --> 16:42.375
No.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.585
It doesn't matter.

16:47.047 --> 16:51.259
I got tickets to the Ranger game.
You want to come with me?

16:52.177 --> 16:54.345
Cute guys in little shorts?

16:54.555 --> 16:55.847
Sure.

16:57.307 --> 17:02.103
Actually, it's a hockey team.
Angry Canadians with no teeth.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.731
That sounds fun too.
Thank you.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.065
Okay.

17:09.944 --> 17:12.238
Have you ever been with a woman?

17:13.866 --> 17:14.991
What?

17:15.159 --> 17:17.367
What is the matter with you?

17:17.618 --> 17:21.204
There is no good time
to ask that question.

17:24.710 --> 17:28.463
The station is Poughkeepsie.
Poughkeepsie!

17:30.549 --> 17:33.384
Ross?

17:34.303 --> 17:36.012
Wake up!

17:38.432 --> 17:41.684
Ross? Ross! Ross!

17:44.938 --> 17:46.647
I need more swordfish.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.402
- Can you get me more swordfish?
- I don't speak English.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.529
You just did.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.240
I don't know what to tell you.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.951
Fine.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.630
Very funny.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.091
Let me out, please.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.676
Come on, I'm cold!

18:18.013 --> 18:20.890
And covered in marinara sauce!

18:21.225 --> 18:22.475
Let me out!

18:26.730 --> 18:28.981
You found that handle, did you?

18:30.901 --> 18:33.903
- It's not funny.
- Well, that's not true.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.408
I'm a good person.
And I'm a good chef.

18:39.618 --> 18:43.746
And I don't deserve to have
marinara sauce all over me!

18:43.956 --> 18:46.666
If you want me
to quit this bad then...

18:46.834 --> 18:48.709
Hey. Chef Geller?

18:49.545 --> 18:51.462
You know that speech you made?

18:51.922 --> 18:53.923
I got a problem with it!

18:56.593 --> 18:58.845
- You do?
- You bet I do!

18:59.721 --> 19:03.432
I just, uh, wasn't listening then,
that's all.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.980
If you want a problem,
I'll give you a problem!

19:09.982 --> 19:12.150
What are you going to do?
Fire me?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.903
You bet I'll fire you!
Get out of my kitchen!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.364
Get out!

19:21.743 --> 19:22.785
All right.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.746
Anybody else got a problem?

19:25.956 --> 19:27.999
How about you, chuckles?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.959
You think this is funny now?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.210
No.

19:32.379 --> 19:36.841
What if I dance covered in sauce?
You think it's funny?

19:37.885 --> 19:39.594
No, it's really good.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.431
Take those salads to table four.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.433
And you, get the swordfish!

19:45.809 --> 19:47.185
And you!

19:47.519 --> 19:49.187
Get a haircut!

19:52.107 --> 19:56.944
Last stop, Montreal.
The stop is Montreal!

19:59.823 --> 20:01.282
What?

20:05.662 --> 20:08.998
I bet myself
that you had beautiful eyes.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.709
Now that I see them, I win!

20:14.796 --> 20:15.963
What?

20:17.174 --> 20:20.426
We're at my stop.
Would you like to have coffee?

20:24.640 --> 20:26.349
Are we really in Montreal?

20:26.808 --> 20:27.975
Yes, we are.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.685
So coffee?

20:31.939 --> 20:33.439
Coffee sounds great.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.360
Wait.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.528
So you live in Montreal?

20:39.738 --> 20:43.449
No, but it's only a two-hour
ferry ride to Nova Scotia.

20:46.870 --> 20:49.497
I should have thought
about my wife and kids...

20:49.748 --> 20:52.041
...before I talked back
to Chef Geller.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.460
Thanks.

20:54.670 --> 20:58.965
It will be a lean Christmas
at the Dragon house this year.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.469
Enough!

21:04.846 --> 21:07.390
Lean, lean, lean!

21:10.560 --> 21:13.688
Went to the store
Sat on Santa's lap

21:13.855 --> 21:16.941
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

21:18.402 --> 21:21.904
Said all you need is
To write them a song

21:22.239 --> 21:26.075
Now you haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

21:26.952 --> 21:29.370
No, don't sing along

21:30.038 --> 21:32.790
Monica, Monica

21:33.125 --> 21:36.252
Have a happy Hanukkah

21:37.671 --> 21:40.131
Saw Santa Claus

21:40.382 --> 21:43.801
He said hello to Ross

21:45.012 --> 21:47.888
And please tell Joey

21:48.181 --> 21:51.392
Christmas will be snowy

21:52.936 --> 21:55.896
And Rachel and Chandler

22:01.194 --> 22:03.404
Happy holidays, everybody!
