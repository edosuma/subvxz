00:23.649 --> 00:26.434
Okay, tell me the truth, am I stuck
in a laser/dog bark/fart rut?

00:26.435 --> 00:27.669
- No.
- Yes.

00:27.703 --> 00:30.204
Has anyone seen my volcano?

00:30.205 --> 00:31.472
Did you check all your pockets?

00:31.473 --> 00:33.241
Can you describe
what it looks like?

00:33.275 --> 00:35.143
Well, it's volcano-shaped,

00:35.144 --> 00:37.245
and it's my science fair
project from last year.

00:37.279 --> 00:38.646
Oh, it's in the liquor cabinet.

00:38.647 --> 00:40.331
I've been using it
as a wine koozie.

00:40.332 --> 00:41.916
It's fun, I love it.

00:41.950 --> 00:44.135
Introducing my science fair
project for this year.

00:44.136 --> 00:45.637
Hold on.

00:45.638 --> 00:48.039
Wait, you're turning in
the same project again?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.557
Will Mr. Blevins let you do that?

00:49.558 --> 00:51.059
Yeah, Louise, he's
not just a teacher,

00:51.060 --> 00:52.560
he's the head of the science fair.

00:52.561 --> 00:54.178
He must be swimming in women.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.546
Don't worry about Blevins.

00:55.547 --> 00:57.148
I can play him like a fiddle.

00:57.149 --> 01:00.551
A strange, puffy fiddle with
a ponytail and a sad butt.

01:00.586 --> 01:02.587
Louise, shouldn't you
just do a new project,

01:02.588 --> 01:04.489
like you're supposed to?
Why?

01:04.489 --> 01:07.225
- Um, I don't know, to learn something?
- You learn something.

01:07.226 --> 01:09.527
Okay honey,
good luck with your volcano.

01:11.397 --> 01:12.947
123,

01:12.981 --> 01:14.716
124...

01:14.717 --> 01:16.217
What are
you two kooks doing?

01:16.218 --> 01:18.386
It's for our science fair project:

01:18.387 --> 01:20.188
"How Many Hairs Are Up There?"

01:20.189 --> 01:21.989
The tough part is
keeping them all organized.

01:21.990 --> 01:23.424
I ga... Oh!

01:23.425 --> 01:24.992
- One, two...
- You guys are working too hard.

01:24.993 --> 01:26.060
As per "uuge."

01:26.095 --> 01:28.763
Good morning, children.

01:28.764 --> 01:32.066
My name is Mr. Dinkler, and I will
be taking over this science class.

01:32.101 --> 01:33.851
Whoa, whoa whoa, what?

01:33.852 --> 01:35.186
What happened to Mr. Blevins?

01:35.220 --> 01:36.220
He's dead.

01:37.589 --> 01:38.856
To this classroom.

01:38.857 --> 01:41.793
He's at home recovering from
a severe attack of gout.

01:41.794 --> 01:45.263
But I'm sick of talking about him,
so let's just move on already.

01:45.264 --> 01:47.565
Some of you might recognize me
if you've been down

01:47.566 --> 01:49.901
to the Science Museum
on Tuesday nights.

01:49.902 --> 01:53.538
I am a Thomas Edison
impersonator and reenactor.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.239
Thomas Edison was the greatest

01:55.240 --> 01:57.709
- genius who ever lived.
-  Oh, boy.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.911
Can anyone name
any of his inventions?

01:59.912 --> 02:01.913
The lightbulb...
The lightbulb.

02:01.914 --> 02:03.047
The phonograph.

02:03.048 --> 02:04.615
The kinetoscope.

02:04.616 --> 02:08.286
It goes on and on and on,
basically everything.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.221
So, I know the fourth grade
science fair

02:10.222 --> 02:12.824
is coming up,
because I'm in charge of it now.

02:12.825 --> 02:15.143
I only have one rule
for science fairs:

02:15.144 --> 02:19.831
- No vol-ca-noes.
- Huh?

02:19.832 --> 02:22.800
Kids have been using these
papier-matcher monstrosities

02:22.801 --> 02:25.937
to avoid real work for years,
and I'll have none of it.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.639
Okay, Mr. Dinkler, time out.

02:28.674 --> 02:29.674
Relax.

02:29.675 --> 02:31.175
I already got the go-ahead

02:31.176 --> 02:32.810
- from Mr. Blevins on my volcano.
- Huh?

02:32.811 --> 02:34.746
So, I'm kind of
grandfathered in there.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.447
What is your name, young lady?

02:36.482 --> 02:40.551
It's Louise, as in "Jeez,
Louise, you're the best."

02:40.586 --> 02:42.553
Why don't we find you
another topic?

02:42.588 --> 02:43.588
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

02:43.589 --> 02:44.822
I already got it.

02:44.857 --> 02:45.907
I'll pick one for you.

02:45.941 --> 02:47.141
Don't need to, I got one.

02:47.142 --> 02:48.476
Yeah...
Thank you so much.

02:48.477 --> 02:49.777
Nope, gonna pick one.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.512
And it's the best
topic in the world:

02:51.513 --> 02:53.648
Thomas Edison!

02:53.682 --> 02:55.583
Um, but I'm doing Thomas Edison.

02:55.584 --> 02:57.418
You can both do Edison, moron.

02:57.419 --> 03:00.288
There's enough of him to go
around, trust me.

03:00.289 --> 03:01.823
Mr. Dinkler, you're new here,

03:01.824 --> 03:03.758
so please don't be
offended if I disregard

03:03.759 --> 03:08.262
everything you say and turn
in Mt. Louise-ius here.

03:08.263 --> 03:10.715
Wow, I bet stuff
comes out of the top

03:10.716 --> 03:13.618
where this hole is
and it's just a real hoot.

03:13.619 --> 03:15.219
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.155
Oops.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.990
Why did I throw that down?
Wha...

03:18.991 --> 03:20.658
- Oh, wha... I'm stepping on it?
- No!

03:20.692 --> 03:22.660
Why am I stepping on it?

03:22.661 --> 03:25.329
Over and over and over again.

03:25.330 --> 03:26.497
Stop it!

03:27.499 --> 03:28.666
Uh-huh.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.867
You're doing Edison, kid.

03:29.868 --> 03:31.202
How about some science, huh?

03:32.821 --> 03:35.690
- Ugh, I can't believe that guy.
- Hmph.

03:35.691 --> 03:37.809
And now I have to go
to the library,

03:37.810 --> 03:39.744
which I never wanted to have to do.

03:39.745 --> 03:41.662
- Ugh!
- Yeah, ugh!

03:41.713 --> 03:43.047
Wait, I like the library.

03:43.048 --> 03:45.633
I need information
on Thomas Edison.

03:45.634 --> 03:47.969
Something no one
would recognize if plagiarized.

03:48.003 --> 03:50.805
Biographies, under "E." Thanks.

03:50.806 --> 03:51.973
That's my job.

03:51.974 --> 03:53.641
And I love it.
Topsy.

03:53.675 --> 03:55.343
Hmm?
I didn't say anything.

03:55.394 --> 03:58.629
Tooooopsssyyyyy.

03:58.664 --> 04:00.531
Are you saying <i>Top Chef?</i>

04:00.532 --> 04:02.066
I think he said Topsy.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.668
No, I didn't.
Yes, I did.

04:03.669 --> 04:04.819
What's a Topsy?

04:04.820 --> 04:06.721
I don't know, don't ask me.

04:06.722 --> 04:07.905
Look it up.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.173
Like in a book?

04:09.208 --> 04:10.741
Yeah, sure, books are great.

04:10.742 --> 04:12.376
No, use the Internet.

04:12.377 --> 04:13.544
Books are stupid.

04:13.579 --> 04:14.712
I thought books were smart.

04:14.746 --> 04:16.214
No, they're stupid.

04:16.248 --> 04:17.464
But you're a librarian.

04:17.499 --> 04:19.083
Yeah, so shh!

04:19.084 --> 04:21.619
Hmm.
Topsy.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.020
Look, Topsy the circus elephant.

04:23.021 --> 04:25.189
Thomas Edison wanted
to show the world

04:25.190 --> 04:28.426
that AC current was more dangerous
than his own patented DC current...

04:28.427 --> 04:30.027
Blah, blah, blah.

04:30.028 --> 04:31.729
Oh, there's a video.
Click that.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.598
Ooh, elephant.

04:33.632 --> 04:35.433
I bet it sneezes and it's adorable.

04:36.768 --> 04:38.135
What was that?

04:38.136 --> 04:39.420
Play it again, Play it again.

04:40.689 --> 04:42.456
It was electrocuted.

04:42.457 --> 04:43.925
To death.
On purpose.

04:43.926 --> 04:45.059
In public.

04:45.060 --> 04:46.627
By Thomas Edison.

04:46.628 --> 04:48.062
What is he, a supervillain?

04:48.096 --> 04:50.831
Well, it says that Topsy
trampled three people.

04:50.866 --> 04:52.567
Well yeah,
she's a big, fat elephant.

04:52.568 --> 04:55.770
The point is, I've got
my science fair project.

04:55.771 --> 05:00.091
I'm gonna tell everyone the truth
about Edison the Electro-cutioner.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.059
Tell it, sister.
So heroic.

05:02.060 --> 05:03.294
Let me finish!

05:03.295 --> 05:07.832
And make Mr. Dinkler look like an
evil-inventor-impersonating ass.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.100
There she is.
Oh, right.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.751
Don't do it, Don't do it.

05:10.752 --> 05:12.086
Do it, do it.

05:14.631 --> 05:16.965
And then I say, "Hey. Lightbulb.

05:16.966 --> 05:19.368
The lightbulb.

05:19.369 --> 05:20.636
I'm Edison, thank you."

05:20.637 --> 05:22.071
And everyone claps.

05:22.105 --> 05:24.373
Mr. Dinkler, shouldn't
Louise and I make sure

05:24.374 --> 05:28.177
that we're not both doing the same
thing for our Edison project?

05:28.211 --> 05:29.611
Well, let's see, Jeremy.

05:29.612 --> 05:31.480
Is your project
going to blow everyone away?

05:31.481 --> 05:34.349
'Cause if it's not,
then don't worry about it.

05:34.384 --> 05:36.318
What's so funny?!

05:36.319 --> 05:39.088
Hey, everybody, volcano-girl
here is gonna blow our minds.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.355
Did you hear that, Tom?

05:40.390 --> 05:41.724
Well, I will!

05:41.725 --> 05:43.358
I've got something big,
Mr. Dinkler.

05:43.393 --> 05:45.360
You ain't got nothing
and you know it.

05:45.395 --> 05:47.362
You keep believing that,
Mr. Dinkler.

05:47.397 --> 05:52.935
I will. You keep believing
that,  Mr. Dink-ler.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.506
Yes, yes!

05:57.507 --> 06:00.242
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Very... funny. Ha!

06:00.243 --> 06:01.444
Ah!

06:01.478 --> 06:03.111
Okay, change of plans.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.797
Some little report pasted
onto construction paper

06:04.798 --> 06:05.898
isn't gonna be enough.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.082
Not for that punk.

06:07.116 --> 06:08.702
I hate construction paper.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.419
Dinkler's a reenactor.

06:10.420 --> 06:12.588
I'm going reenactment on his butt.

06:12.589 --> 06:14.623
With actors and effects
and everything.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.558
We're gonna bring this
nightmare to life.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.960
- Oh.
- Oh.

06:17.994 --> 06:20.596
All right, I'm gonna need
an Edison and a Topsy.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.397
Gene, can you give me
a maniacal laugh?

06:22.432 --> 06:25.167
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

06:25.201 --> 06:26.869
Good enough, you're Edison.

06:26.870 --> 06:28.637
Tina, act like an elephant.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.240
Not bad, you're hired.

06:31.274 --> 06:33.208
Oh, you know what else
your project needs?

06:33.209 --> 06:34.643
- Science?
- Music.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.811
By me.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.980
Something dramatic, but danceable.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.398
Cha, cha, cha, cha.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.485
Fine, as long as we electrocute
an elephant, it's okay with me.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.404
But not really electrocuting,
just reenacting.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.105
Yes, Tina. Jeesh.

06:47.106 --> 06:49.775
Little Miss Don't-
Really-Electrocute-Me over here.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.477
Diva.
- Mm-hmm.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.378
What else do you want
on your rider?

06:53.379 --> 06:54.830
Hello, children.

06:54.864 --> 06:56.315
Ah, Teddy, come here.

06:56.316 --> 06:57.716
I'm doing a project
and I need to make

06:57.717 --> 06:58.951
huge sparks and lightning bolts.

06:58.952 --> 06:59.985
What do you know about that stuff?

07:00.019 --> 07:02.888
In high school, my buddies and I
built a Van de Graaff generator.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.022
You know, to get girls.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.507
Ah, nice.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.309
Will you do something
like that for me?

07:07.310 --> 07:09.027
Adults aren't allowed to
help, so you'll have to hide.

07:09.028 --> 07:10.195
But... eh?

07:10.230 --> 07:11.730
- Sure.
- Let's go!

07:11.731 --> 07:13.715
Okay, no burger, that's fine.

07:13.716 --> 07:15.250
Ahh, I'm not freaking out here!

07:15.251 --> 07:16.318
Ahh...

07:17.720 --> 07:19.137
I know they're in here somewhere.

07:19.138 --> 07:21.173
Bob, come to bed.
Here it is.

07:21.174 --> 07:23.859
All this science fair stuff
reminded me of my old invention.

07:23.893 --> 07:26.361
Spiceps.
Spice-wah?

07:26.396 --> 07:28.831
They're sleeves that
you wear on your biceps

07:28.832 --> 07:31.567
- to hold all your spices while you cook.
- Wha.

07:31.568 --> 07:32.901
Look,.

07:32.902 --> 07:34.336
Okay, good night.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.573
Hey Lin, what if I was
wearing just these.

07:37.607 --> 07:40.342
'Cause, whoop, I am.

07:40.343 --> 07:42.160
- All right, come here.
- I'm coming.

07:42.161 --> 07:43.762
<i>Wait, wait, wait,</i>

07:43.763 --> 07:45.163
<i>you're getting spice
all over the bed.</i>

07:45.164 --> 07:46.415
Topsy...

07:46.416 --> 07:47.783
autopsy...

07:47.784 --> 07:49.084
Is there something there?

07:49.085 --> 07:50.869
I'm not talking; I'm in character.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.671
Except, can I trample you?

07:52.672 --> 07:54.072
I'm trying
to get in that head space.

07:54.107 --> 07:56.184
Yeah, sure.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.343
Did, uh,
did you guys notice my Spiceps?

07:58.378 --> 08:00.178
Dad, not now.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.547
Pffh, Spiceps.

08:01.548 --> 08:04.683
You might have something there, if
you just changed it completely.

08:04.684 --> 08:07.252
- They're perfect the way they are.
- Dad, shush.

08:07.253 --> 08:09.187
Okay, Tina, as long as you have
perfect pitch, we'll be fine.

08:09.188 --> 08:11.089
- And a one, and a two.

14:39.207 --> 14:41.658
Not as smart as this kid
right here; She's a genius.

stole this kid's idea

14:44.262 --> 14:45.863

14:53.438 --> 14:54.855
Jeremy, shush.

15:01.629 --> 15:04.031

this science fair needs,

15:04.032 --> 15:05.465

15:05.466 --> 15:07.234
Really? All right!

15:07.268 --> 15:09.403
- What?
- I've got to call our landlord and my aunt

15:09.404 --> 15:12.806
and maybe some choir kids and
maybe a couple of band geeks.

15:12.807 --> 15:15.375
If that's how you celebrate
good news, sure.

15:15.410 --> 15:16.643
But, Gene, what about Louise?

15:16.644 --> 15:19.062
What about the truth?

15:21.316 --> 15:22.549
What did you say?

15:22.550 --> 15:24.084
I was just wondering
if we need flutes.

15:24.085 --> 15:25.786
Who plays flute?
Do you play flute?

15:25.820 --> 15:28.705
Louise, some janitor just
asked me what I was doing here.

15:28.706 --> 15:30.357
I panicked; I said I was a doctor.

15:30.375 --> 15:32.559
So if anyone asks,
I'm Dr. Glen Wellness.

15:32.560 --> 15:33.994
I served in Korea.

15:33.995 --> 15:35.662
I handled a triage alone.

15:35.663 --> 15:37.130
Just if anyone asks.

15:37.131 --> 15:40.826
I delivered triplets in the
back of a cab, if anyone asks.

15:43.126 --> 15:46.345
Ms. Schnurr, I want to say I totally
understand why I'm in here.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.913
I was disrespectful.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.799
I was out of line, and oh, my God,

15:49.800 --> 15:51.450
did you move that picture?

15:51.485 --> 15:52.985
Wow.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.420
You are fast.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.755
I do martial arts.

15:55.756 --> 15:56.889
It shows.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.491
Hello, hi.

15:58.492 --> 15:59.992

15:59.993 --> 16:02.161

16:02.162 --> 16:03.929
All right, let's show these people

16:03.930 --> 16:07.233
that if it ain't man-on-elephant
love, it ain't worth singing about.

16:07.284 --> 16:09.184

16:09.185 --> 16:11.186
We have a very special treat

16:11.187 --> 16:14.156
It's a musical re-imagenactment

16:14.190 --> 16:18.627
of the very uplifting story of Thomas
Edison and Topsy the elephant.

16:18.628 --> 16:22.248
♪ They say Thomas Edison

16:22.299 --> 16:25.634
♪ He's the man to get us
into this century ♪

16:27.304 --> 16:29.088
♪ And that man is me

16:29.089 --> 16:31.240
♪ They'll say all...

16:31.274 --> 16:33.025
What's going on?
Where's Louise?

16:33.026 --> 16:35.795
And why do Tina and Gene sound
like Gayle and Mr. Fischoeder?

16:35.796 --> 16:37.063
It's science, Bob.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.431
You're not supposed
to understand it.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.066
Okay.

16:42.519 --> 16:44.136
Come on, Ms. Schnurr.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.604
Let me out of here.

16:45.639 --> 16:47.273
This is my destiny.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.842
Shh, I'm trying to eat this yogurt.

16:49.843 --> 16:52.144
Toot, toot, here comes books.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.379
Creepy librarian.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.480
Do I know you?

16:54.514 --> 16:56.348
You told me about Topsy.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.417
I tell everyone about Topsy.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.219
So, here's the book you requested.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.704
Good stuff, chick lit.

17:01.738 --> 17:03.506
Oh, you've got to help me.

17:03.507 --> 17:05.374
Tell her I've got to go
to the fair.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.476
Tell her I've got
to take Dinkler down.

17:07.511 --> 17:09.178
Shh, leave me out of it.

17:09.179 --> 17:10.563
You started it.

17:10.564 --> 17:12.498
I start, I don't finish things.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.965
That's my one flaw.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.367
So, how's that yogurt?

17:15.367 --> 17:16.669
Fine! Forget you!

17:16.670 --> 17:19.305
Forget all of you!
Eat your yogurt!

17:19.339 --> 17:21.473
I'm busting out!

17:21.525 --> 17:25.828
Get everything ready,
Teddy, because this is happening.

17:25.862 --> 17:28.164
I'll get to the radio
and when I say "hit it,"

17:28.165 --> 17:30.099
you hit it
with everything you've got.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.333
<i>Capisce?</i>

17:31.334 --> 17:32.401
Wait, don't leave me.

17:32.436 --> 17:34.370
Okay, everything's all right.

17:34.371 --> 17:35.704
You're Dr. Glen Wellness.

17:35.705 --> 17:37.173
You can handle anything.

17:37.174 --> 17:39.125
Hell, you got the highest MCATs
in the state.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.144
♪ But I never noticed

17:42.179 --> 17:44.780
♪ The curve of her trunk

17:44.781 --> 17:47.917
♪ And I never noticed

17:47.918 --> 17:50.419
♪ His electric junk

17:50.453 --> 17:55.591
♪ We might just have found

17:55.625 --> 18:00.846

♪ Electric love...

18:07.220 --> 18:09.121
Wow, did Gene write this?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.589
God, I want what they have.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.408
It's so romantic.

18:12.442 --> 18:18.030
♪ Electric love

18:18.031 --> 18:23.485
♪ Electric love...

18:23.486 --> 18:29.074
♪ Fits like a glove.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.944
This is what really
happened, people.

18:31.945 --> 18:37.199
This man, Thomas Edison, sentenced
Topsy, that beautiful elephant,

18:37.217 --> 18:40.236
to die by electrocution.

18:40.237 --> 18:42.671
Uh-oh.

18:42.672 --> 18:44.640
Here's your hero, Dinkler.

18:44.641 --> 18:45.975
Hit it!

18:46.009 --> 18:47.343
Is that you, Louise?

18:47.344 --> 18:48.911
Hit it!
I've been down here so long.

18:48.912 --> 18:50.479
What's it like out there?

18:50.480 --> 18:52.314
Are people still the same
with their funny ways?

18:52.349 --> 18:53.749
Teddy, hit it!

18:53.750 --> 18:55.071
Oh, right, the thing we're doing.

18:57.904 --> 19:01.690
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh.

19:08.197 --> 19:09.548
- Oh!
- Tina!

19:09.583 --> 19:11.050
Tina!

19:11.084 --> 19:12.693
Tina?

19:15.355 --> 19:16.672
I'm okay.

19:16.706 --> 19:18.941
Oh! Oh, God.
Oh, thank God. Tina.

19:18.942 --> 19:20.676
I thought we weren't doing
the death scene,

19:20.677 --> 19:22.711
but I saw the sparks
and went with it.

19:22.712 --> 19:23.979
Was I convincing?

19:24.014 --> 19:25.247
Yes, very.

19:25.282 --> 19:28.717
Oh, my God, I almost
electrocuted my sister.

19:28.718 --> 19:31.971
- I've become Edison.
- Oh, you wish.

19:31.972 --> 19:33.872
So he electrocuted animals.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.107
So what?

19:35.108 --> 19:36.942
As if everyone here is so perfect.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.616
Oh, got a little caught up
in the moment.

19:43.617 --> 19:44.883
We're in love!

19:44.884 --> 19:46.385
We're a couple in love!

19:46.386 --> 19:49.288
It's really happening finally!

19:49.289 --> 19:52.508
Thank you, God!
Got to go.

19:52.509 --> 19:54.543
Could have asked me to sing,
but whatever.

19:54.544 --> 19:56.478
You know, I could've sung it.

19:56.513 --> 19:58.881
Louise, is there something
you want to say to your sister?

19:58.882 --> 20:01.233
Tina, I'm sorry
I nearly killed you.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.319
I got carried away
with the Dinkler thing,

20:03.320 --> 20:05.304
which worked out pretty well,
but still,

20:05.305 --> 20:07.139
I shouldn't have almost killed you.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.675
It's okay; This is how Topsy
would have wanted it,

20:09.676 --> 20:11.143
but with more trampling people.

20:11.177 --> 20:12.845
And, Gene, I'm sorry to you, too.

20:12.846 --> 20:14.246
Your song was really good.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.715
I know, and without
a single fart sound.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.183
Oh, my God, I forgot
the fart sounds!

20:18.184 --> 20:19.385
How'd we do?

20:19.419 --> 20:21.153
Well, you almost killed
my daughter.

20:21.154 --> 20:23.155
So yeah, not great.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.040
Oh, wow, sorry about that.

20:25.041 --> 20:27.009
Hey, did you check out
that Spiceps thing?

20:27.010 --> 20:28.077
- Cool, huh?
- Really?

20:28.078 --> 20:29.603
I thought so.
Yeah.

20:29.604 --> 20:31.880
Since Mr. Dinkler is
in the bathroom, crying,

20:31.881 --> 20:34.750
I'm stepping in to announce
the science fair winners.

20:34.784 --> 20:37.753
Second lace goes to
"How Many Hairs Up There?",

20:37.754 --> 20:40.322
by Andy and Ollie Pesto.

20:40.357 --> 20:42.274
- Oh, my God! I want to thank Ollie.
- I want to thank Andy.

20:42.275 --> 20:43.742
I want to thank Ollie.
I want to thank Andy.

20:43.777 --> 20:45.644
That got second?
That's ridiculous.

20:45.679 --> 20:49.248
And the blue ribbon goes
to "Spice..."

20:49.282 --> 20:50.708
uh, I can't read this.

20:50.717 --> 20:52.685
Spice Rack! Spice Rack!
Spiceps, Spiceps!

20:52.686 --> 20:54.469
Spice Rack!
Spiceps!

20:54.470 --> 20:56.005
- Spiceps!
- Ow! Rack!
