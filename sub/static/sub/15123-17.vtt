WEBVTT

00:05.973 --> 00:07.941
(Hope giggles)

00:08.008 --> 00:09.610
Very funny, Hope,

00:09.677 --> 00:10.911
but, uh, you need
your spoon to eat your oatmeal.

00:10.978 --> 00:12.080
No!

00:13.081 --> 00:14.348
Whoa!
BURT:
Ha-ha!

00:14.415 --> 00:15.649
Denied.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.151
VIRGINIA:
She did the same thing
to me last night

00:17.218 --> 00:18.452
when she wouldn't eat her peas.

00:18.519 --> 00:19.920
BURT:
Yeah, she's getting
an attitude.

00:19.987 --> 00:22.390
Yesterday I told her not to
touch the knobs on the stove.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.591
She didn't use
her fingers,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.093
but her eyes
were flipping me the bird.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.560
She's just being funny.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.528
She's testing you.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.063
She's like that crazy
old dead guy

00:29.130 --> 00:31.765
in North Korea with all those
missiles. She's almost as tall.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.467
You need to keep that in check.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.935
What do you mean, like
yell at her or something?

00:35.002 --> 00:36.304
We're best friends.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.339
Best friends don't
yell at each other.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.374
Sure they do, what about
the Three Stooges?

00:40.441 --> 00:41.609
Or the Car Talk guys?

00:41.675 --> 00:43.211
Rizzoli and Isles.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.245
SABRINA:
Good morning.

00:44.312 --> 00:46.147
VIRGINIA:
Coffee?

00:46.214 --> 00:47.481
Uh, no thanks.
Do you guys have tea?

00:47.548 --> 00:49.550
(British accent):
Yes, we have tea

00:49.617 --> 00:52.686
after we finish
cleaning our chimney.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.255
VIRGINIA: (British accent):
What say

00:54.322 --> 00:57.658
we make a couple of mugs and
sip it with our pinkies out,

00:57.725 --> 00:59.727
and then we'll put another
shrimp on the barbie.

00:59.793 --> 01:02.496
(laughing)
I'm just gonna take
this little skit

01:02.563 --> 01:04.698
as your way of telling me
that you don't have tea.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.934
Oh, no, we have tea. It's on
that shelf behind the crackers

01:07.000 --> 01:08.236
next to the beef bouillon cubes.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.438
Oh, I forgot about those.
Grab me one.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.039
They're like meat-flavored
hard candies.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.807
(scratching)
Oh!

01:13.874 --> 01:15.843
(whispers):
Something's under the house.

01:15.909 --> 01:16.710
Uh?

01:16.777 --> 01:17.745
Oh, no!

01:17.811 --> 01:19.413
What was that?

01:19.480 --> 01:21.182
(animal chittering)
I hear teeth. I hear claws.

01:21.249 --> 01:24.017
I hear a tail.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.553
It's a beaver!

01:25.619 --> 01:27.521
It's not a beaver,
you always say beaver.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.022
I think you just
like saying beaver.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.159
I do like saying beaver.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.360
(animal chittering)
Raccoon.

01:32.426 --> 01:35.529
Don't worry.
I'll get rid of it.

01:35.596 --> 01:37.097
Isn't that kind of
more of a husband job?

01:37.165 --> 01:38.399
VIRGINIA:
Well, you'd think.

01:38.466 --> 01:40.968
Some people around here
get a little nutty

01:41.034 --> 01:42.403
when it comes to small animals.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.372
Just marsupials
and aquatic mammals.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.907
And raccoons,
dirty little weasels.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.476
Oh, and weasels.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.311
Fortunately, I hate turning the
lights on every Friday night

01:50.378 --> 01:52.313
for the orthodox Jewish family
across the street,

01:52.380 --> 01:53.647
so Burt takes care of that.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.217
(chuckling)
Okay, all right, all right.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.018
Uh, give me one more shot.

01:58.085 --> 02:04.658
Uh, Baruch atah Adonai
Eloheinu melech ha-olam

02:04.725 --> 02:05.393
badoorah?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.827
(imitating buzzer)

02:06.894 --> 02:10.398
Oyvay, those Bronsteins
are so meshuganah.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.701
* Whoo! *

02:13.767 --> 02:14.535
* Here we go *

02:14.602 --> 02:16.637
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! *

02:20.674 --> 02:23.477
She was the first Porkchester
of my collection.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.480
(sniffles) The little swine
I feel in love with,

02:26.547 --> 02:30.218
(sniffles) who introduced me
to the of pig-ur-enes,

02:30.284 --> 02:32.920
and now she's gone.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.121
(sobbing)

02:34.188 --> 02:36.424
Well, we could scoop up
the pieces

02:36.490 --> 02:38.426
and put her in the
urn with Paw Paw.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.563
He'd probably like
some company anyway.

02:42.630 --> 02:44.932
Or, I could just
try to fix her.

02:44.998 --> 02:47.067
(sniffles)

02:47.134 --> 02:49.237
Hey.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.971
How is Hope?

02:51.038 --> 02:54.308
Well, her serial killer
mother would be very proud.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.043
She slaughtered
her first victim today.

02:56.109 --> 02:57.945
We lost a Porkchester.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.413
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.981
Are you sure Hope did it?

03:01.048 --> 03:02.683
Yes, I'm sure she did it.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.185
And that's not all, I caught
her in the hallway today

03:05.253 --> 03:07.187
drawing on the wall
with markers.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.456
I washed it off,

03:08.522 --> 03:10.658
but then I had a big clean spot
on the wall.

03:10.724 --> 03:12.793
So, now I got to either
wash the whole wall,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.263
or figure out how to make
the spot dirty again.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.398
We should only markers
the color of our walls.

03:17.465 --> 03:18.666
VIRGINIA :
washing up the marker,

03:18.732 --> 03:21.835
she climbs up on the chair,
grabs two Porkchesters,

03:21.902 --> 03:24.838
and throws them at me!

03:24.905 --> 03:26.740
I could only catch Paddy.
(sobbing)

03:26.807 --> 03:28.108
Did you yell at her?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.810
Well, I'm not
yelling at her.

03:29.877 --> 03:30.911
(Virginia sniffles)

03:30.978 --> 03:32.580
I want her to like me.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.214
Well, I'm not yelling at her.
I want her to like me, too.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.549
Well, grandmothers don't yell.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.386
We get to give them butterscotch
candies and nickels.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.554
Parents have to do
all the dirty work.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.356
And besides,
she's hardheaded like you were.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.325
I don't think yelling's
going to be strong enough.

03:44.392 --> 03:46.126
Are you saying
I should spank her?

03:46.193 --> 03:47.060
Oh?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.029
Not hard, just a...

03:49.096 --> 03:53.000
little eensy-weensy "boop,"
just to get her attention.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.568
It worked with you.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.637
Wait, are you saying
you spanked me?

03:56.704 --> 03:57.571
See, you don't even remember it.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.407
How bad could it have been?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.942
VIRGINIA:
You were just a little older
than Hope is now

04:02.009 --> 04:03.744
when you started to be
a real pain in the butt

04:03.811 --> 04:05.178
about eating your vegetables.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.414
Take a bite, Jimmy.

04:06.480 --> 04:07.915
Bite me, Burt.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.450
After we let you
get away with that,

04:09.517 --> 04:10.818
you wouldn't listen to us
when we told you

04:10.884 --> 04:13.354
it was time to turn off
the TV and go to bed.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.022
Come at me, bro!
Come at me!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.223
Let's do this!

04:16.290 --> 04:17.925
Come at me, bro!
Ah!

04:17.991 --> 04:20.027
VIRGINIA:
We couldn't even get you
to clean up your room.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.597
Whoo...!

04:23.664 --> 04:26.166
Magazine says
to be encouraging.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.769
Hey, son of mine.

04:28.836 --> 04:31.805
What do you say
we take some pride

04:31.872 --> 04:35.008
in our play space
and clean up our room?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.013
How do you like me now, son?

04:44.352 --> 04:45.386
I think it's time
to spank him.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.620
I thought we both agreed
to be the

04:46.687 --> 04:48.422
do-nothing-but-hope-for-the-best
kind of parents?

04:48.489 --> 04:49.790
Well, that's not
working anymore,

04:49.857 --> 04:51.792
and we're running
out of options.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.363
And windows.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.064
I guess
it needs to be done.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.532
Okay, good luck.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.100
Wait, why do I have
to spank him?

05:00.167 --> 05:02.503
If you do the spanking, I'll do
something you don't want to do.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.837
What do you hate doing?

05:03.904 --> 05:05.706
Answering stupid questions.
(chuckles)

05:05.773 --> 05:08.609
Sorry, but you just
set me up so perfectly.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.344
Burt, pick something.
Okay, um...

05:10.411 --> 05:11.845
You're responsible

05:11.912 --> 05:13.681
for getting all the rodents
out from under the house.

05:13.747 --> 05:16.450
And for picking up dog poop,
if we ever get a dog.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.918
Deal. And while you're
spanking your son,

05:17.985 --> 05:19.953
make sure you tell him
he's never getting a dog.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.793
VIRGINIA:
As hard as it was to do,
after that one spanking,

05:25.859 --> 05:27.428
you were like
a totally different kid.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.229
(smacking sound)
JIMMY:
Ow!

05:29.296 --> 05:32.165
We didn't even have to tell you
to clean your room anymore.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.601
All clean!
Hmm.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.636
Please don't spank me again.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.237

a fight at bedtime.

Okay, Jimmy,
time for bed.

in the right measure *

05:55.322 --> 05:56.624

05:59.092 --> 06:02.162
* Cruel to be kind
means that I love you. *

06:02.229 --> 06:03.464
I can't believe
you spanked me.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.165
It had to be done.

06:05.232 --> 06:06.734
And it only had to be done once.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.170
No, no, no. No, no.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.271
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

don't, don't!

BURT: Okay.

06:15.008 --> 06:15.809
Okay, deep breaths!

06:15.876 --> 06:17.445
(hyperventilating)
Deep breaths.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.180
Deep breaths...

06:20.247 --> 06:21.582
Look, I know this looks bad,

06:21.649 --> 06:23.517
but kids go through phases,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.586
and I'm not ruining
my relationship with her

06:25.653 --> 06:27.087
as a quick-fix for this phase.

06:27.154 --> 06:30.524
Yeah, well, when you finally
come to your senses

06:30.591 --> 06:32.192
and end up spanking her,
you'll see we're not

06:32.259 --> 06:34.227
the idiots you think we are.

06:34.294 --> 06:37.130
Why did you stop?

06:38.198 --> 06:39.332
Burt?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.435
Do you have superglue
on your finger?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.936
Okay, no problem.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.539
On the count of three, we'll
just pull apart like a wishbone.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.008
Well, my wish is that I end up

06:48.075 --> 06:50.878
with a little piece
of your finger on my nose

06:50.944 --> 06:53.581
instead of you having a little
piece of my nose on your finger.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.583
Okay, I'm going to wish
for the opposite of that.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.217
Understood.

06:57.284 --> 06:59.052
So, whoever gets the bigger
piece gets their wish.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.020
You ready?
No.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.221

07:27.147 --> 07:28.716
And Vince Vaughn.
And Bradley Cooper.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.884
And that homeless-looking guy
from Counting Crows.

07:30.951 --> 07:34.254
So you're just going to lure
him out and trap him humanely?

07:34.321 --> 07:35.489
(laughs)
No.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.890
I stuffed a bunch
of razor blades in here.

to death.

Mm-hmm.
'Cause I could
sing to him,

07:47.501 --> 07:49.302
and then we could
lure him out.

07:49.369 --> 07:51.204
Just think,
we could set him free.

He could live a long
comfortable life in the wild.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.949
Look at his face.
(chitters)

08:02.015 --> 08:03.651
I mean, I'm sure
if we got to know him...

08:03.717 --> 08:05.285
All right. Stop.

just give it a shot.

Yeah, I do actually.
I wrote a song when I was six

08:11.925 --> 08:13.727
to help lure my cat
out from under my bed.

08:13.794 --> 08:14.862
I'm just going
to change the words

08:14.928 --> 08:17.230
so it should
be perfect.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.305
* You heard a noise,
so you fled *

08:25.372 --> 08:26.974
(squeaking)

08:27.040 --> 08:32.179
* And now you're scared,
under my... house *

08:32.245 --> 08:34.615
* No need to run *

08:34.682 --> 08:37.317
* No need to scat *

08:37.384 --> 08:42.590
* You're just a little nervous
because you're a... raccoon. *

08:45.492 --> 08:48.562
Hey, you fixed
the Porkchesters.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.964
Well, I couldn't find
every piece but...

08:51.031 --> 08:53.200
Do you think your mom will
notice that Polly Porkchester

08:53.266 --> 08:56.036
has a piece of macaroni
for a snout?
No,

08:56.103 --> 08:58.772
but she might notice that you
used cheese puffs for hooves.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.747
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.315
Ah, what are you doing?

09:08.381 --> 09:09.617
I thought we were buddies.

09:09.683 --> 09:12.119
Buddies don't do this.

09:12.185 --> 09:13.420
(chittering)

09:13.486 --> 09:14.822
* We've got to be admittin' *

09:14.888 --> 09:17.858
* With you we are so smitten *

09:17.925 --> 09:19.627
* That's why this song
we've written *

09:19.693 --> 09:22.663
* So please come out *

09:22.730 --> 09:24.264
* Sweet... *

09:24.331 --> 09:29.236
* Little... raccoon. *

09:29.302 --> 09:30.537
Yeah, I don't think
it's working.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.705
I think he's fallen asleep.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.073
Yeah, he might be
a little bit bored.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.574
But I think he'll love
the techno remix.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.645
I'm going to go get Shelley's
laptop and turntables.
Mm-hmm.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.851
All right, buddy,
you had your chance.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.953
Let's do this thing.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.622
That's right, give it a sniff.
(chitters)

09:48.689 --> 09:50.658
(growls)
(scoffs)
Damn.

09:50.724 --> 09:55.062
Another rejection
for Jennifer Aniston.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.968
Oh, hey, what do you
got there, honey?

10:01.034 --> 10:02.502
Oh, no, Hope.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.705
You took the knobs
off the stove?

10:04.772 --> 10:05.839
Way to go, Dad.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.641
Hope wondered into your zone

10:07.708 --> 10:10.811
and you just let her play
with the stove again.

10:10.878 --> 10:12.746
Dad?

10:12.813 --> 10:15.382
(sniffing)

10:15.448 --> 10:17.718
(murmuring)

10:27.728 --> 10:29.362
VIRGINIA:
What the hell's going on?

10:29.429 --> 10:31.064
Hey, you can't park
your bike there, man.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.333
Hope took all the knobs
off the stove again.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.301
I guess she left the gas on.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.870
I opened all the windows
and the doors.

10:36.937 --> 10:37.805
Should be cleared out soon.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.006
Oh, here it comes!

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
Oh!

10:41.108 --> 10:43.944
Jimmy, she could have
killed your father.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.378
She could have
killed all of us.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.915
We keep telling her "no"
and she's not listening.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.050
You need to make her
not so abstinent.

10:50.117 --> 10:51.118
Uh.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.652
(chuckles)
You're right.
You're right.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.122
I can't believe I'm saying this
but I guess I have to spank her.

10:57.725 --> 10:58.658
Hopefully it'll just
be the one time.

10:58.726 --> 11:00.193
And not too hard.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.129
Just enough so she knows
you still love her,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.964
but also so she knows
you mean business.

11:04.031 --> 11:08.168
Somewhere between
Mary Poppins and Precious.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.270
I'm okay.

11:13.406 --> 11:16.409
Mm. Yeah. I'm good.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.679
Hope, sometimes a father
has to spank his child.

11:19.747 --> 11:21.314
It could be worse.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.884
In Modern Family, that guy shot
his kid to teach him a lesson.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.853
And everybody just loved that.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.155
BURT:
Jimmy, wait!

11:28.221 --> 11:30.423
Oh, don't do it. I can't
let you spank her.

11:30.490 --> 11:33.260
Look, I don't like it either,
but she's out of control,

11:33.326 --> 11:34.728
and it worked
when you spanked me, so...

11:34.795 --> 11:37.397
No, it didn't.

11:37.464 --> 11:39.366
BURT:
I told your mother
I'd spank you

11:39.432 --> 11:41.201
but I couldn't
bring myself to do it.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.470
(smacking sound)
JIMMY:
Ow!

11:43.536 --> 11:45.438
(smacking sound)
Ow!

11:46.506 --> 11:48.141
Ow!

11:50.343 --> 11:52.079
BURT:
You never actually got better.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.181
I just made your mother
think you did.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.428
Delicious, Mommy.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.230
Please don't spank me again.

12:10.297 --> 12:12.365
Anything you refused to do,
I did for you.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.206
And the thing I couldn't
do for you, I faked.

12:23.944 --> 12:27.114
(whispering):
Don't forget to use
those headphones I bought you.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.283
I-I can't believe that
you didn't spank me.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.085
I mean, you told me
to spank Hope

12:32.152 --> 12:33.753
because it worked
when you spanked me.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.922
I'm not perfect.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.824
Nobody's perfect.
Look at you.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.191
You're made of triangles.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.761
Hmm. Okay, might have a
little gas left in my brain.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.864
I'm telling Mom.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.632
Aw, so now you're a rat. Nice.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.335
I didn't see you so anxious
to tell the truth when you were

12:48.401 --> 12:50.570
the only kid in preschool
who got to watch Arsenio.

12:50.637 --> 12:52.840
(whooping)

12:54.107 --> 12:56.476
(techno music plays)

12:56.543 --> 12:58.211
* You heard a noise *

12:58.278 --> 12:59.847
* So you fled *
Play louder.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.381
I think he's
covering up his ears.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.151
* Now you're scared
under my house... *

13:04.217 --> 13:05.652
VIRGINIA:
How'd it go?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.320
Did you spank her?
Did she cry?

13:07.387 --> 13:09.222
I couldn't hear over
DJ Jazzy Sabrina.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.124
JIMMY:
No, I didn't spank her.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.560
And guess what I found out:
Dad never spanked me.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.095
He only pretended to,

13:15.162 --> 13:17.064
and then let me do whatever
I wanted behind your back.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.665
Is that true, Burt?

13:18.731 --> 13:20.000
You're a jerk, you know that?

13:20.067 --> 13:21.534
When you were four, we
promised we'd never tell.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.704
We made a cross-the-streams-and-
hope-to-die pee-pee promise.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.874
You never spanked him?

13:26.940 --> 13:28.208
You lied to me?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.943
Yes, I lied.
(gasps)

13:30.010 --> 13:31.011
We are no longer
pee-pee brothers.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.612
I'm okay with that.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.780
Guys. Guys, keep arguing.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.048
I think
it's freaking him out.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.084
He's looking
for a way out.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.418
Do you know how many critters

13:38.485 --> 13:40.353
I have had to wrangle
from underneath this house

13:40.420 --> 13:42.589
because I thought
you spanked our son?

13:42.655 --> 13:43.723
Forty-six, Virginia!

13:43.790 --> 13:45.025
Forty-six!

13:45.092 --> 13:46.059
SABRINA:
Oh, guys...

13:46.126 --> 13:47.961
Guys, maybe take
it down a notch,

13:48.028 --> 13:49.963
he's starting to look
a little aggressive.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.999
Two dozen rats, 12 possums,

13:52.065 --> 13:53.833
seven raccoons,
and three rabid squirrels.

13:53.901 --> 13:54.968
You think this
hasn't been hard on me?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.769
Hard on you?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.805
Burt, I got rabies.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.040
Rabies!

14:00.107 --> 14:01.708
Oh, so now that's a bad thing?

14:01.774 --> 14:03.143
When's the last party
we were at

14:03.210 --> 14:05.112
where you didn't have
half a dozen people around you

14:05.178 --> 14:06.947
laughing at your
"How I got rabies" story?

14:07.014 --> 14:09.649
Oh! Oh, dear God!

14:09.716 --> 14:11.718
(raccoon snarling)
Oh, God!

14:11.784 --> 14:13.820
(screaming)

14:13.887 --> 14:15.322
(raccoon snarling)

14:18.825 --> 14:20.793
(dog barking)

14:20.860 --> 14:22.896
It all makes sense now.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.965
They never disciplined me.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.399
I still don't
eat vegetables,

14:26.466 --> 14:28.401
my room's a mess, and
I can't fall asleep

14:28.468 --> 14:30.437
without thinking about things
that make me go "hmm."

14:30.503 --> 14:32.572
Do you think that raccoon
is going to be okay?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.042
I mean, I'm really glad that
I took that infant CPR class,

14:35.108 --> 14:37.310
but it's just...
the shape of the mouth

14:37.377 --> 14:39.146
is completely different
on these creatures.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.414
It's impossible
to get a tight seal.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.217
I can't do the same
thing my dad did.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.718
I have to stop trying
to be Hope's friend

14:45.785 --> 14:47.520
and make sure that she-she
grows up with discipline.

14:47.587 --> 14:49.656
And I'm not going to
be lazy about it.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.824
I'm going to read the books
and I'm-I'm gonna do this right.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.326
Jimmy...
my raccoon might be dead

14:53.393 --> 14:55.528
and this is all
you're thinking about?

14:55.595 --> 14:56.663
"Your" raccoon?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.631
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.866
"Our" raccoon.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.101
(raccoon chitters,
Sabrina gasps)

15:01.168 --> 15:02.802
Oh, God, he's alive.
Yep.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.137
It's probably got
a concussion,

15:04.204 --> 15:05.472
so the most important thing

15:05.538 --> 15:07.240
is to keep it awake
for the next 48 hours.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.376
If it seems okay after that,
then you can let it go.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.112
And if he doesn't seem okay?
I'd still let it go.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.085
Well... I've got good news
and I've got bad news.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.387
Unfortunately, the good news
isn't for you.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.994
What's that?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.328
Chicken wire.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.097
I'm gonna put it up
around the porch

15:30.163 --> 15:32.132
so no more animals
can get underneath us.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.533
I know, it's an old house,

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
you shouldn't sink money
into it, but what the hell?

15:36.003 --> 15:37.737
Why didn't you
ever do that before?

15:37.804 --> 15:39.272
It was never my job before.

15:39.339 --> 15:41.941
So you wouldn't do it to make
my life a little easier?

15:42.009 --> 15:43.176
Did you ever
want to help me

15:43.243 --> 15:44.311
clean the bugs out of
the light fixtures?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.046
There's just so many of them.

15:46.113 --> 15:48.081
It's tragic.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.716
They're flies, Virginia.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.817
They're born in poop.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.852
Every day after that is a gift.

15:52.919 --> 15:56.356
Ah, we never should have done
the crappy jobs separately.

15:56.423 --> 15:57.324
We should've worked together.

15:57.390 --> 16:00.093
You're right.
No more of that.

16:00.160 --> 16:01.461
Too bad we didn't
learn this sooner.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.163
Maybe Jimmy wouldn't
be so screwed up.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.065
He's not that screwed up.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.200
Come on, he's a slob
with lousy sleep habits

16:07.267 --> 16:08.935
who never eats his vegetables.

16:09.002 --> 16:10.170
He's like Dennis the Menace

16:10.237 --> 16:11.804
except he doesn't
make us laugh every day.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.073
Well, maybe it's not too late.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.841
We are still his parents.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.176
Yeah, you're right.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.045
And if he's going
to live under our roof,

16:18.111 --> 16:19.779
he's going to live
under our rules.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.682
Burt, it's not our roof.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.452
Don't bring that up
when I'm laying down the law.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.455
All right, Hope,

16:28.521 --> 16:30.923
we are gonna do
this by the book.

16:30.990 --> 16:34.094
Dah, dah, dah, dah.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.196
"Daddy loves you very much,

16:36.263 --> 16:38.631
"but it's time for
you to go to bed.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.632
"Half circle.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.634
"Gently stroking head,
loving but firm.

16:41.701 --> 16:42.835
"Half circle.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.172
I will see you
in the morning."

16:45.872 --> 16:48.208
Oh. Ha ha.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.711
I'll see you in the morning.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.353
You ready?
I guess.

17:03.656 --> 17:04.691
Oh.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.493
What was that?

17:06.559 --> 17:07.827
Don't look.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.896
Well, I did it.
Hope's in bed.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.298
Fingers crossed
she stays there,

17:11.364 --> 17:13.032
because I want to watch some...

17:13.100 --> 17:14.501
Where's the TV?

17:16.636 --> 17:18.771
There is no more TV.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.906
Not after 8:00.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.008
It doesn't encourage
good sleep habits.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.510
You're kidding, right?
No.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.912
We are absolutely serious, and
committed to follow through.

17:25.978 --> 17:27.347
Guys, quit being jerks.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.449
This is the finale
of Celebrity Pet Swap.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.950
Flavor Flav's getting
his cat back tonight.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.819
It wears a little clock
on the collar.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.753
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.356
Actions have consequences.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.591
Yeah. You guys acted
like terrible parents,

17:38.658 --> 17:40.893
and now you have to deal
with the consequences.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.061
Watch your tone, young man.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.430
You guys just
feel guilty.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.232
These techniques are
for little kids.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.066
You missed your chance
to do the right thing.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.901
HOPE:
Hi.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.738
I, however, did not.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.108
Hope, you need to stay
in your crib.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.809
It's sleep time. Come on.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.978
I'm serious, Hope.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.613
You have to stay in your bed.

18:00.680 --> 18:02.081
And I know you can
understand me.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.984
If Dick Cheney's spider monkey
can understand Flavor Flav,

18:05.051 --> 18:07.687
you can understand me.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.893
What are you doing?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.061
I'm getting a sweet treat.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.297
Is it still okay
if I have a sweet treat?

18:24.837 --> 18:26.339
Oh, this is ridiculous.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.940
What, am I not
allowed to eat anymore?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.242
Oh, no,
you're allowed to eat.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.010
And you can even
have a sweet treat.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.313
As soon as you
finish your dinner.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.417
Did you get that
out of the garbage?

18:37.484 --> 18:40.153
Yes, but it was between
two other TV dinners,

18:40.220 --> 18:41.721
so it's only been touched
by its own kind.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.491
And you, young man, are not
allowed to eat anything else

18:44.557 --> 18:46.726
until you have
finished your peas.

18:47.727 --> 18:48.695
This is ridiculous.

18:48.761 --> 18:51.030
All right,
I'm going to Sabrina's.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.099
Where are my keys?
You mean these?

18:53.166 --> 18:55.668
My keys, to my van?
It's my van.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.771
Oh, no, this was my pee-pee
brother's van, and he's dead.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.739
Give me those keys.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.342
Go fish.

19:02.409 --> 19:04.244
Hey. Get your hand out of my...

19:04.311 --> 19:06.112
Ow, ow, ow!
What the hell was that?

19:06.179 --> 19:07.780
It's my bottle
opener key chain.

19:07.847 --> 19:08.748
Give me those!

19:08.815 --> 19:09.982
You're not going anywhere!

19:10.049 --> 19:11.618
You're not getting a sweet treat
until you eat your peas!

19:11.684 --> 19:13.353
You don't tell me what to do.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.987
I'm your father.
You will eat your peas.
No!

19:15.054 --> 19:16.456
Eat your peas!
Screw you!

19:16.523 --> 19:18.225
That is it, young man!

19:20.827 --> 19:21.794
Ow!

19:21.861 --> 19:23.663
Eat your peas!
What are you doing?

19:23.730 --> 19:26.299
What I should've done 20
years ago. Eat your peas!

19:26.366 --> 19:27.367
I hate you!

19:27.434 --> 19:30.169
Eat your peas!

19:48.120 --> 19:50.523
Oh, my God.
She ate a pea.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.392
I bet it's because she
saw your dad spanking you.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.026
She doesn't want
it to happen to her.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.396
Eat your peas.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.067
JIMMY: I don't know if we just
got incredibly lucky,

20:01.133 --> 20:03.503
or we invented a new form
of discipline,

20:03.570 --> 20:05.071
but it worked really well
for us.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.607
And except the few times
when Dad got carried away,

20:07.674 --> 20:09.409
it wasn't too bad for me.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.179
Pick up your toys!

20:13.246 --> 20:15.782
We never did figure out
whether spanking was right

20:15.848 --> 20:17.950
or wrong, but we did find out
that by working together,

20:18.017 --> 20:20.353
we could come up with the best
solution for our problem.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.655
And that wasn't just true
for spanking,

20:22.722 --> 20:25.124
it was true
for a lot of things.

20:25.191 --> 20:26.726
(Hope giggles)

20:26.793 --> 20:28.961
One of the best parts
of being in a relationship

20:29.028 --> 20:31.598
is doing things together, even
if it is spending the one night

20:31.664 --> 20:34.301
you get alone with your
girlfriend, keeping a raccoon

20:34.367 --> 20:36.102
with a concussion awake

20:36.168 --> 20:37.837
or setting the little guy free.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.773
Things are always easier
if you have a partner.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.709
Okay. Yeah.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.745
Good-bye, Robert.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.113
Or Roberta.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.749
I never really did
get a good look.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.490
And Mom and Dad learned

20:57.557 --> 20:59.692
that the chores they thought
was so unpleasant

20:59.759 --> 21:02.862
weren't so bad when they
weren't doing them alone.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.533
(sighs)

21:06.599 --> 21:09.469
It is better
doing this stuff together.

21:14.073 --> 21:17.009
JIMMY: Even if all you're doing
is making more stuff

21:17.076 --> 21:19.045
for you to do together
tomorrow.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.613
(chittering)

21:27.920 --> 21:32.291
Dad and I even became
pee-pee brothers again.

21:32.359 --> 21:34.661
But you don't want to see that.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.631
How do you
like me now, son?
