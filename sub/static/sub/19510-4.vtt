28:40.850 --> 28:42.892
SAM, HE'S ONE IN A MILLION.

28:42.892 --> 28:45.224
HE'S JUST BRAVE, SMART.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.797
HE'S JUST AN ALL-AROUND
GREAT GUY.

28:47.797 --> 28:49.198
THANKS. YEAH, I AGREE.

28:49.198 --> 28:51.030
OK. YOU READY
TO GET GOIN'?

28:51.030 --> 28:53.903
GOT A GOOD FEELIN'
ABOUT THIS.

28:54.864 --> 28:55.264
DON'T SAY IT.

28:55.264 --> 28:57.736
I'M SORRY.
HE'S NOT THAT BAD.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.870
I TOLD YOU NOT TO SAY IT.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.975
NINA.

29:05.975 --> 29:06.745
NINA!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.147
BABE,
I'M RIGHT HERE.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.078
YEAH.
HEY.

29:09.078 --> 29:10.379
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

29:10.379 --> 29:11.250
YEAH, I'M FINE.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.323
I JUST HEARD HUMANS
CAN PLEASE DEMONS IN BED.

29:14.323 --> 29:17.256
BEN, I TOLD YOU THIS
WASN'T A PROBLEM.

29:17.256 --> 29:17.927
YES, IT IS!

29:17.927 --> 29:22.161
SEX IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT
IN A STRONG RELATIONSHIP.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.934
IT IS THE CORNERSTONE OF...

29:24.934 --> 29:26.135
SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

29:26.135 --> 29:28.537
I--I READ IT
IN SOME FEMALE BOOKS.

29:28.537 --> 29:29.839
WHAT EXACTLY
ARE FEMALE BOOKS?

29:29.839 --> 29:32.041
LOOK, I--I KNOW
WHAT IT IS, ALL RIGHT?

29:32.041 --> 29:34.874
YOU--YOU CAN'T
BE YOURSELF SEXUALLY.

29:34.874 --> 29:40.479
YOU CHANGE INTO HUMAN FORM,
AND TR--AND PRETEND TO BE
SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.182
AND I--I WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

29:43.182 --> 29:44.413
SO I--

29:44.413 --> 29:49.088
I'M GONNA HAVE SEX WITH YOU
IN YOUR NATURAL BODY.

29:49.819 --> 29:52.021
NOW, I WOULD SIMPLY
ASK THAT YOU BE CAREFUL

29:52.021 --> 29:53.823
THAT YOUR WINGS
DON'T POKE ME IN THE EYE.

29:53.823 --> 29:57.266
ALSO, PLEASE BE AWARE
MY SKIN IS VERY SENSITIVE.
IT CHAFES EASILY.

29:57.266 --> 29:59.899
ALSO, PLEASE DON'T TALK
WHILE WE'RE DOING IT.

29:59.899 --> 30:03.132
I MEAN, YOUR DEMON VOICE
IS A LITTLE MANNISH, OK?

30:03.132 --> 30:05.074
NOW, I'M GONNA HAVE
A COCKTAIL FIRST.

30:05.074 --> 30:08.377
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.
DO YOU HAVE A GLASS?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.884
SO YOU WANT THIS?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.590
[SNARLS]

30:22.551 --> 30:25.855
I CAN DRINK
FROM THE BOTTLE.

30:36.405 --> 30:39.969
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT
MY LATE HUSBAND.

30:39.969 --> 30:43.172
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO GET
YOUR HANDS ON HIS ESTATE,

30:43.172 --> 30:44.473
WELL, YOU CAN FORGET ABOUT IT.

30:44.473 --> 30:46.615
HE MADE SURE
THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT.

30:46.615 --> 30:51.050
UM, ACTUALLY WE'RE
HERE TO WARN YOU,

30:51.050 --> 30:54.884
AND, UM, I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA SOUND CRAZY.

30:54.884 --> 30:56.625
IT'S JUST THAT...

30:57.286 --> 30:59.388
EDMUND FITZGERALD MIGHT
BE BACK FROM THE DEAD

30:59.388 --> 31:00.589
AND MIGHT BE TRYING
TO KIDNAP YOU.

31:00.589 --> 31:06.095
I WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LITTLE MORE
DELICATE ABOUT IT,

31:06.095 --> 31:07.596
BUT YES. IT'S TRUE.

31:07.596 --> 31:09.498
HE HAD THIS LIST OF
EVERYTHING HE EVER OWNED,

31:09.498 --> 31:12.641
EVERYTHING HE LOVED,
AND YOU'RE THE LAST THING
ON THE LIST.

31:12.641 --> 31:16.445
AH, WELL, NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE A COUPLE OF CRACKPOTS.

31:16.445 --> 31:20.449
EDMUND LOVED ONLY THINGS,
POSSESSIONS.

31:20.449 --> 31:21.610
NOTHING ELSE MATTERED.

31:21.610 --> 31:24.483
NO, HE DID. MARY ANN
WAS ON HIS LIST.

31:24.483 --> 31:27.216
THAT'S NOT ME.
THAT WAS HIS BOAT,

31:27.216 --> 31:28.157
THE MARY ANN.

31:28.157 --> 31:31.890
SHE SANK TO THE BOTTOM
OF THE PACIFIC 50 YEARS AGO.

31:31.890 --> 31:35.424
BUT IF EDMUND'S GHOST
IS LOOKING FOR THAT,

31:35.424 --> 31:36.465
WELL, HE'LL NEVER FIND IT.

31:36.465 --> 31:38.998
SERVES HIM RIGHT,
THE SON OF A BITCH.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.230
WELL, I FEEL COMPELLED
TO POINT OUT

31:41.230 --> 31:42.571
THAT YOU'RE
ATTACKING THE DEAD.

31:42.571 --> 31:44.903
AND TO SAY THERE'S
NOTHING REALLY WRONG

31:44.903 --> 31:47.937
WITH HAVING
AN APPRECIATION
OF THE FINER THINGS,

31:47.937 --> 31:49.108
WHICH CLEARLY
YOUR LATE HUSBAND--

31:49.108 --> 31:51.180
ACTUALLY, WE WERE
JUST LEAVING.

31:52.681 --> 31:55.684
YOU'RE WEARING HIS RING.

31:57.046 --> 31:58.087

OH.

31:59.448 --> 32:00.249
[SIGHS]

32:00.249 --> 32:01.120
YOU'RE GONNA GET US KILLED.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.421
FITZGERALD IS GONNA
COME LOOKING FOR THAT.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.922
HE'S NOT EVEN GONNA
KNOW IT'S MISSING, SAM.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.556
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK.
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK
RIGHT NOW.

32:07.556 --> 32:10.329
NO. I LIKE IT.

32:10.329 --> 32:11.660
YOU ARE SUCH A DICK.

32:11.660 --> 32:15.434
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY THE DEVIL
IS DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

32:15.434 --> 32:16.465
YOU'RE A MORON.

32:16.465 --> 32:17.436
HE SAID THAT?

32:17.436 --> 32:18.537
HE SAID
HE WAS DISAPPOINTED?

32:18.537 --> 32:21.370
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF.

32:21.370 --> 32:22.371
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU WANT,

32:22.371 --> 32:24.313
AND IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
WHO GETS HURT.

32:24.313 --> 32:28.277
WHY WOULD I CARE,
WHEN THE WORLD'S
FULL OF GUYS LIKE YOU,

32:28.277 --> 32:29.178
RESPONSIBLE
AND ETHICAL?

32:29.178 --> 32:32.181
I DON'T FEEL THAT.
NEVER FELT IT.

32:32.181 --> 32:37.026
IN FACT, I'VE NEVER FELT
ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY.

32:37.656 --> 32:38.988
IT'S VERY LIBERATING.

32:38.988 --> 32:40.289
I MEAN, COME ON.
DO YOU REALLY THINK

32:40.289 --> 32:42.661
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF
FOR THE FAMILY BUSINESS?

32:42.661 --> 32:45.334
NOT A CHANCE.

32:45.334 --> 32:48.137
BUT YOU,
YOU SPILL YOUR BLOOD,

32:48.137 --> 32:51.270
YOU WORK HARD,
AND YOU DO A GOOD JOB

32:51.270 --> 32:53.402

WHEN THE TIME COMES,

32:53.402 --> 32:55.444

I'M DONE WITH THIS.
I'M DONE WITH YOU.

33:09.358 --> 33:10.589

PLANNED FOR US,

TO KEEP THOSE, RIGHT?

RUNNING AWAY FROM YOU.

TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH NOW.

TO BE AN ANGEL.

TELL YOU IS

36:11.840 --> 36:15.774
THAT YOU'RE NOT

BEFORE THE FALL,
SOME ANGELS

36:19.808 --> 36:22.451
CAME TO EARTH
AND MARRIED HUMANS.

36:22.451 --> 36:24.182
THERE WERE EVEN
CHILDREN BORN.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.954
THEY WERE CALLED
NEPHILIM.

36:25.954 --> 36:26.715

36:26.715 --> 36:28.657

OF THOSE ANGELS.

OR ANYTHING,

FALL IN LOVE.

HE BANISHED US
FROM PARADISE

THAT I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

YOU'RE A JACKASS.
YOU KNOW THAT?

39:29.568 --> 39:30.599
OH, LISTEN TO THIS.

39:30.599 --> 39:31.840
FIGHTING LIKE 2 BROTHERS.

39:31.840 --> 39:33.602
I'M GETTIN' ALL MISTY.

39:33.602 --> 39:36.575
HA HA HA! LOOK AT YOU, HUH?

39:36.575 --> 39:38.006
THE HERO. YOU CAPTURED
YOUR FIRST SOUL.

39:38.006 --> 39:40.579
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO MAKE YOU PROUD.

39:40.579 --> 39:44.683
AH. YOU CAN LEARN
A THING OR TWO FROM
THIS GUY, I THINK.

39:44.683 --> 39:45.614
UNBELIEVABLE.

39:45.614 --> 39:46.915
HA HA HA!

39:46.915 --> 39:49.558
HEY, LET ME SEE
THOSE GOLD COINS, SAMMY.

39:49.558 --> 39:53.922
NOW, MORGAN, SAM HAS MADE
QUITE THE INVESTMENT IN YOU

39:53.922 --> 39:56.995
BY BAILING YOU
OUT OF JAIL.

39:56.995 --> 40:00.569
BUT AT YOUR WELL-DESERVED R & R
AT MY VILLA IN THE CAYMANS,

40:00.569 --> 40:03.802
I WANT YOU TO START
THINKING ABOUT HOW
YOU'RE GONNA REPAY HIM.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.674
WH-WHAT?! WHY DOES
HE GET THE GOLD?

40:05.674 --> 40:07.876
WELL, YOU DON'T WANT THAT.
THAT'S BLOOD MONEY.

40:07.876 --> 40:08.877
PEOPLE DIED FOR THAT, SAM.

40:08.877 --> 40:12.410
YOU DON'T MIND A LITTLE BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS, DO YOU, MORGAN?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.784
OH, NO. I, UH, PREFER
BLOOD ON MY HANDS, DAD.

40:15.784 --> 40:18.617
THEN IT'S SETTLED.
[CHUCKLES]

40:18.617 --> 40:18.947
AH.

40:18.947 --> 40:21.189
HEY, THAT'S NOT
A VERY HAPPY SAMMY FACE.

40:21.189 --> 40:24.022
NO, YOU KNOW,
HE DID NOTHING
TO CAPTURE THAT SOUL.

40:24.022 --> 40:24.593
I SAVED HIS LIFE.

40:24.593 --> 40:27.596
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'M JUST TRYIN' TO GIVE THE KID

40:27.596 --> 40:28.597
A LITTLE CONFIDENCE.
THAT'S ALL.

40:28.597 --> 40:30.799
DON'T WANNA DEMORALIZE HIM
HIS FIRST TIME OUT.

40:30.799 --> 40:32.501
YOU DEMORALIZE ME
ALL THE TIME.

40:32.501 --> 40:33.632
WELL, YOU CAN TAKE IT.

40:33.632 --> 40:34.633
AH, WHATEVER.
NO, SAMMY, LOOK.

40:34.633 --> 40:36.535
I DON'T HAVE TO REWARD YOU
WITH TRINKETS

40:36.535 --> 40:40.509
AND PALTRY PIECES
OF GOLD THAT SOME SOUL
HAS VOMITED UP.

40:40.509 --> 40:42.541
YOU'RE MUCH BIGGER
THAN THAT. YOU ARE.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.214
IN FACT, I'M BEGINNING
TO REASSESS THIS
WHOLE SITUATION.

40:46.214 --> 40:50.448
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
MORGAN ISN'T THE ONE
I SHOULD BE PRIMING.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.781
MAYBE THE PERFECT SON
IS YOU.

40:52.781 --> 40:54.452
NO. NO, I'M NOT.
SERIOUSLY.

40:54.452 --> 40:55.554
YES.
PUT IT OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

40:55.554 --> 40:58.527
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S BECOMING CLEARER
AND CLEARER TO ME

40:58.527 --> 41:01.159
THAT YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO WILL BE SITTING
AT MY RIGHT HAND.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.492
MORGAN CAN
HAVE THAT JOB.
I DON'T WANT IT.

41:03.492 --> 41:04.162
BUT DON'T YOU SEE?

41:04.162 --> 41:07.566
THAT'S WHAT MAKES YOU
SO PERFECT.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.097
WOW.

41:09.097 --> 41:10.168
I AM SO CONFLICTED NOW.

41:10.168 --> 41:12.541
I DON'T KNOW
WHO TO ROOT FOR.

41:12.541 --> 41:14.142
NO. N--MORGAN.

41:14.142 --> 41:16.945
YOU COU--YOU COULD
ROOT FOR MORGAN.

41:16.945 --> 41:18.476
MO...

41:21.510 --> 41:21.910
HEY.

41:21.910 --> 41:24.553
DO YOU MIND MAKING
ONE LAST DELIVERY?

41:24.553 --> 41:26.084
IT'S A BIG FREEZER.
SURE.

41:26.084 --> 41:29.217
OK, GOOD, BECAUSE IT'S
GOIN' TO YOUR MOM'S PLACE.

41:29.217 --> 41:33.121
WHAT DOES SHE NEED
A GIANT FREEZER FOR?

42:12.060 --> 42:16.134
Mr. Oliver:
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE AFRAID.

42:23.071 --> 42:26.114
HEY, SAM.

42:27.716 --> 42:29.648
DAD?
