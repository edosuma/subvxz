WEBVTT

00:10.458 --> 00:12.119
Warlocks, vampires...

00:12.203 --> 00:13.287
All the legends are true.

00:14.497 --> 00:16.999
We protect the human world
from the demon world.

00:17.083 --> 00:18.963
You're a Shadowhunter,
just like the rest of us.

00:19.217 --> 00:20.586
I'm getting married to Lydia.

00:20.670 --> 00:22.270
Maybe you should do
what's in your heart.

00:22.845 --> 00:25.306
I am your father, Clary...
And Jace's.

00:25.925 --> 00:27.737
I need to talk to you.
I think I'm becoming a vampire.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.614
Got a lot of stuff to work on here.
Like controlling my murderous tendencies.

00:30.638 --> 00:34.106
The Mortal Cup is the most important
object in the Shadow World.

00:34.190 --> 00:35.190
Valentine has the Cup.

00:35.692 --> 00:37.353
He'll create an army
of Shadowhunters.

00:37.437 --> 00:39.862
He'll kill thousands
just creating the army.

00:39.946 --> 00:42.733
Strike where your
opponent is vulnerable.

00:42.817 --> 00:44.277
He's here.

00:44.361 --> 00:46.121
- Where's your brother?
- Stay away from her!

00:46.661 --> 00:49.532
- Simon!
- Fight me, and watch your friends die.

00:49.616 --> 00:51.416
- They make you weak.
- Jace...

00:51.499 --> 00:53.077
Valentine is wrong.

00:53.161 --> 00:56.330
- You're not like him.
- You don't know that, Clary. You don't know that.

01:00.758 --> 01:03.087
Join me... And my son!

01:03.171 --> 01:06.966
Together, we can rid the world
of the demons who plague it.

01:07.050 --> 01:11.268
You are the new breed
of Shadowhunters!

01:46.840 --> 01:50.349
- How did you get here? - I Portaled in.
Come on, let's go. We don't have much time.

01:50.432 --> 01:51.635
- I can't.
- What?

01:51.719 --> 01:54.805
- Look, we got to get you out of here.
- No, I'm not leaving without you.

02:01.360 --> 02:03.105
My dear Clarissa.

02:04.190 --> 02:06.984
- You are tenacious, aren't you?
- Stay back.

02:46.733 --> 02:48.359
I killed him.

02:48.443 --> 02:50.660
- Jace, come on. Let's go.
- Valentine...

02:50.743 --> 02:52.905
- We have to go, now!
- No! Get 'em!

03:10.054 --> 03:11.257
Miss me, son?

04:18.204 --> 04:19.666
What is this place?

04:22.125 --> 04:23.537
Looks like a Downworld prison.

04:26.464 --> 04:27.715
More like a zoo.

04:30.927 --> 04:31.927
Where's the Portal?

04:42.188 --> 04:43.891
Your skills may
be unparalleled...

04:45.310 --> 04:47.895
But your loyalty
is sorely lacking.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.031
String him up.

05:31.112 --> 05:32.780
Any word from the Clave?

05:32.864 --> 05:35.491
Not yet, and we've been trying
for the past four hours.

05:35.574 --> 05:38.619
- Something's up.
- Mmm, the Clave being unhelpful?

05:38.702 --> 05:40.698
Who's shocked? Show of hands?

05:41.580 --> 05:44.668
I'm worried. I can't sense Jace
through our parabatai bond.

05:44.751 --> 05:46.585
We'll find him, Alexander.

05:46.669 --> 05:50.589
When we arrested Hodge, he said Valentine was
on a ship. They must still be over water.

05:51.548 --> 05:53.068
Pull up the waterways
around New York.

05:59.306 --> 06:00.746
The ship couldn't
have gone too far.

06:02.053 --> 06:04.722
- Anything?
- Sorry.

06:04.806 --> 06:08.309
- There's got to be something!
- I don't see him.

06:08.983 --> 06:10.227
All right, listen up!

06:11.277 --> 06:14.030
I want 24/7 monitoring of
the Hudson and East Rivers.

06:14.113 --> 06:16.157
If you see anything unusual,
you come to me first.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.785
- I've got this, Alec.
- Then why haven't you found Jace yet?

06:18.868 --> 06:21.590
Don't forget who you're talking to.
I am still the head of this institute.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.990
And my brother is still missing!

06:23.664 --> 06:26.500
- Why don't you just take a break?
- Not now, Izzy.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.912
Isabelle's right,
and it's not a request.

06:28.996 --> 06:29.997
You're dismissed.

06:31.130 --> 06:32.339
Fine!

06:37.594 --> 06:39.138
Everybody, just back off!

06:50.810 --> 06:51.977
Mom.

06:54.236 --> 06:57.191
- My sweet girl!
- I never thought I'd see you again.

06:57.614 --> 07:01.320
I'm so sorry. I never meant
for any of this to happen.

07:01.404 --> 07:03.537
All I ever wanted to
do was to protect you.

07:03.620 --> 07:07.708
I know, but... I'm not a kid anymore.
You don't have to protect me.

07:07.910 --> 07:09.703
Yes, I do.

07:09.787 --> 07:12.880
- By telling me lies?
- Clary...

07:12.964 --> 07:15.341
It's my life. I...
I had a right to know.

07:15.543 --> 07:18.504
- I was scared.
- Because you married a psychopath...

07:19.386 --> 07:20.471
My father.

07:20.554 --> 07:21.757
So, you know.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.850
- Mom, how could you?
- Oh, Clary.

07:24.809 --> 07:26.852
Your father,
he wasn't always like this.

07:26.936 --> 07:29.730
- I deserved to know who I really am.
- I know.

07:29.814 --> 07:32.024
And I promise from now
on, no more lies.

07:39.824 --> 07:41.527
I have something for you.

07:55.541 --> 07:56.750
Where did you get this?

07:57.758 --> 07:59.635
Under the floorboards.

08:00.511 --> 08:02.971
When I was a little kid
and I couldn't sleep, I...

08:03.597 --> 08:07.226
Used to watch you take it out
and cry over it in your bedroom.

08:08.435 --> 08:11.014
I used to think it was about my
father, but now...

08:11.098 --> 08:13.517
I know it's about my brother.

08:15.734 --> 08:17.479
Jonathan.

08:19.196 --> 08:20.572
His name is Jace.

08:22.158 --> 08:23.534
He's alive.

08:26.787 --> 08:28.455
That's impossible.

08:35.873 --> 08:39.424
I'm sorry for how I reacted before.
It's not personal.

08:41.260 --> 08:42.428
I get it.

08:43.429 --> 08:45.132
I'm a lot to get used to.

08:48.052 --> 08:50.061
I know what you're going
through, Alexander.

08:51.020 --> 08:53.397
No, I... I don't think you do.

08:53.480 --> 08:55.316
Jace is a part of me.

08:56.275 --> 08:59.486
Through a rune, we are both
physically and emotionally connected.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.940
If he dies,
a part of me dies, too.

09:02.448 --> 09:04.033
And I know he's out there.

09:04.116 --> 09:06.756
And he's in trouble, and there's
not a damn thing I can do about it.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.665
Tell me what I can do.

09:12.959 --> 09:15.711
Help me track Jace.
I want to use our rune.

09:16.295 --> 09:19.249
I just need your
magic for the pain.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.467
- I can't help you with this.
- Why not?

09:21.550 --> 09:24.505
The last time you used a rune to
track Jace, it almost killed you.

09:24.589 --> 09:26.069
Why can't you just
do this one thing?

09:27.300 --> 09:29.009
After everything
I've done for you.

09:34.521 --> 09:36.809
You don't understand,
I saw them burn.

09:38.603 --> 09:41.862
- Sorry, I just wanted to make sure everything was...
- Luke.

09:41.946 --> 09:44.281
- You all right?
- Is it true?

09:44.365 --> 09:45.776
Is Jonathan alive?

09:45.860 --> 09:48.494
- I couldn't believe it either at first.
- Hey, guys.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.660
- Simon.
- Hey, Mrs. F.

09:54.744 --> 09:56.513
Good to see you on your feet again.
You look great...

09:56.537 --> 09:59.254
- Considering the coma situation.
- What're you doing here?

10:01.173 --> 10:02.549
Um... It's kind of a long story.

10:03.586 --> 10:08.055
So, um, a lot...
A lot happened while you were away.

10:08.257 --> 10:10.509
- Yeah.
- Like what?

10:15.771 --> 10:17.015
You're a vampire.

10:22.813 --> 10:24.533
We have to get to the ops
center, right now.

10:26.484 --> 10:28.200
We are at war.

10:29.160 --> 10:30.954
Valentine now has
the Mortal Cup,

10:31.037 --> 10:33.824
with which he is, no
doubt, raising a new army,

10:33.908 --> 10:35.666
and one of our own
has joined him.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.453
Looks like the queen's
taking back her kingdom.

10:38.537 --> 10:41.999
As a result, the Clave has declared a
state of emergency at the Institute.

10:42.083 --> 10:44.050
Their first priority
is to replace

10:44.251 --> 10:48.179
the current leadership,
who they have deemed wholly ineffectual.

10:49.346 --> 10:51.223
It is an honor to introduce

10:51.307 --> 10:53.977
the newly appointed head
of the New York Institute,

10:54.060 --> 10:56.972
Clave representative,
Victor Aldertree.

11:00.977 --> 11:02.318
- Did you know about this?
- No.

11:02.401 --> 11:04.778
But maybe this is why
Dad went back to Idris.

11:04.861 --> 11:07.065
Maryse went behind my back.

11:09.741 --> 11:11.236
My fellow Shadowhunters.

11:11.320 --> 11:13.780
It's an honor to be
here with you all.

11:13.864 --> 11:15.455
We have to find Jace Wayland.

11:15.539 --> 11:18.368
He's a Shadowhunter,
and we don't leave our people behind.

11:18.452 --> 11:21.753
The answer to his location may
very well lie in this room.

11:21.837 --> 11:25.674
So, I wanna speak with everyone who went
on a mission where Jace disappeared.

11:27.426 --> 11:29.178
One last thing.

11:29.261 --> 11:32.181
Effective immediately,
the Institute is on lockdown.

11:32.383 --> 11:35.517
But it's only temporary.
Let's turn this institute around.

11:40.689 --> 11:43.650
Wait, if we're on lockdown,
who's out there looking for Jace?

11:43.734 --> 11:46.653
We'll think of something.
Don't worry.

11:46.737 --> 11:49.406
Jace is tough.
Valentine will never break him.

12:22.851 --> 12:23.892
Enough!

12:28.064 --> 12:29.941
I killed you twice today.

12:30.025 --> 12:32.192
You want to go for another
round, huh?

12:32.276 --> 12:33.570
You're a born fighter.

12:34.571 --> 12:35.862
I like it.

12:35.946 --> 12:37.572
Get dressed.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.286
We have a lot to talk about.

12:51.629 --> 12:52.923
You wanted to see me?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.465
Yes, Clary.

12:55.549 --> 12:57.175
Take a seat.

13:06.812 --> 13:08.145
Sorry about the camera.

13:08.229 --> 13:12.190
Like I told your friends when they came
in, this is official business, so...

13:12.274 --> 13:13.860
I have to be official.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.112
Now...

13:18.073 --> 13:19.199
Let's talk about Jace.

13:20.867 --> 13:24.077
You had the impression he was saving
your lives by leaving with Valentine?

13:25.038 --> 13:27.914
It's more than an impression.
It's what actually happened.

13:28.625 --> 13:30.812
If he had tried anything,
the rest of us would have been killed.

13:30.836 --> 13:34.671
- Was he within striking distance of Valentine??
- I told you, it... It...

13:34.756 --> 13:38.008
- Could he have taken the man out?
- It was an impossible situation, okay?

13:38.552 --> 13:42.304
Jace tried to warn us.
He told us Valentine was on the way.

13:43.432 --> 13:48.520
So... Jace knew ahead of time
that Valentine was setting a trap.

13:49.646 --> 13:54.275
- How do you suppose he knew that?
- I don't know. He told us to get out of there.

13:55.276 --> 13:58.113
Next thing I knew,
I had a seraph blade to my throat.

14:07.664 --> 14:08.872
Got it.

14:08.956 --> 14:12.250
Look, Jace saved our lives.
We have to find him.

14:15.631 --> 14:17.798
That's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

14:34.483 --> 14:36.109
Mmm. Needs pecorino, hmm?

14:37.486 --> 14:41.696
Do you remember your fifth birthday? And I
made you spaghetti? Your absolute favorite.

14:41.780 --> 14:43.740
Michael Wayland used
to make me spaghetti.

14:44.785 --> 14:45.826
Just try some.

14:45.910 --> 14:48.036
You really think I want
to have a meal with you?

14:56.170 --> 14:59.005
Didn't I teach you not
to play with knives?

14:59.090 --> 15:01.635
Look, I know that head of
yours is full of questions.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.469
So, go ahead. Don't be shy.

15:05.013 --> 15:07.514
Why did you fake your death and
pretend to be Michael Wayland?

15:07.599 --> 15:09.225
To protect you from my enemies.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.060
As Michael Wayland,
I knew you'd be safe.

15:12.144 --> 15:16.400
Safe? You made me an orphan.

15:16.483 --> 15:20.278
I spent my entire life mourning a father
I thought died in front of my eyes.

15:20.361 --> 15:22.195
Well, it made you
stronger, didn't it?

15:22.279 --> 15:25.200
No, the Lightwoods made me strong.
They took me in, they trained me.

15:25.283 --> 15:26.741
If anyone's my
parents, they are.

15:26.825 --> 15:30.872
I had no choice, Jonathan.
My enemies were closing in.

15:30.956 --> 15:33.665
I sent you to a place where I
knew you would be cared for.

15:34.292 --> 15:35.709
Father of the year.

15:35.794 --> 15:38.254
Look, we had ten years
together, and sure...

15:38.338 --> 15:40.297
I may have been hard on
you, but...

15:42.551 --> 15:43.925
It's because I loved you, son.

15:44.428 --> 15:48.388
No. All you've ever done is lie to me.
You told me I never had a mother.

15:49.265 --> 15:51.016
What did you want me to say?

15:51.101 --> 15:53.685
That I saved you and that
your mother deserted you?

15:53.769 --> 15:55.812
She left you to die in Idris.

15:57.273 --> 15:59.649
- Why would she do that?
- Because you're different.

15:59.900 --> 16:00.984
You're special.

16:01.860 --> 16:06.031
Look, I know that you have always felt more
powerful than everyone else around you.

16:06.657 --> 16:08.491
That's because you are.

16:32.808 --> 16:34.892
You experimented on me?

16:34.977 --> 16:38.146
I made you stronger, faster...

16:38.230 --> 16:41.816
More lethal than any
other Shadowhunter.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.443
Why?

16:43.526 --> 16:47.322
To create the perfect weapon,
the ideal marriage of good and evil.

16:47.406 --> 16:51.284
A Shadowhunter with
pure demon blood.

17:02.713 --> 17:03.797
Are you goin' home?

17:04.673 --> 17:08.300
Where else would I be going?
My interview's over, and I'm exhausted.

17:08.384 --> 17:12.680
Besides, at my house, there's steak
and vodka. I'd rather be there.

17:13.513 --> 17:16.893
Wait, you're just...
You're not gonna help?

17:20.981 --> 17:22.815
You really don't get it, do you?

17:24.108 --> 17:27.278
You didn't risk anything for
me, you did it for you.

17:28.070 --> 17:32.158
What? Are you seriously doing
this right now? Right now?

17:32.242 --> 17:34.828
You know damn well I want to
find Jace just as much as you do,

17:34.911 --> 17:38.151
- but that's no excuse to treat me like...
- Well, then, what do you want from me?

17:42.335 --> 17:43.503
At the moment...

17:44.462 --> 17:45.463
Nothing.

18:00.562 --> 18:01.687
Who sounded the alarm?

18:01.772 --> 18:02.939
WANTED - DEAD OR ALIVE

18:03.023 --> 18:05.317
- What's going on?
- Oh, no.

18:14.821 --> 18:16.823
Aldertree said he
wanted to rescue Jace.

18:16.907 --> 18:19.159
Actually, Clary,
I said I wanted to find him.

18:19.242 --> 18:21.619
And you gave me the clue
I needed to do just that.

18:21.702 --> 18:23.835
- What did you tell him?
- Alec, it...

18:23.919 --> 18:25.211
Is this everyone?

18:25.295 --> 18:26.338
Fantastic.

18:26.422 --> 18:29.507
First up,
all Downworlders are forbidden

18:29.591 --> 18:32.130
from entering the Institute
without my prior approval.

18:32.213 --> 18:35.847
For those still present, good day.
Mr. Graymark...

18:37.427 --> 18:38.892
I'm not leaving Jocelyn.

18:39.763 --> 18:43.021
Besides, my badge gives access
to resources that you don't have.

18:43.105 --> 18:44.439
I can help you find Jace.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.984
That's generous of you,
but I'm going to have to insist.

18:48.068 --> 18:50.195
- Call me when you can.
- Yeah.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.454
You, too... Simon.

18:59.538 --> 19:00.663
Simon, right?

19:00.747 --> 19:02.660
It's almost dawn.

19:02.743 --> 19:05.168
- I don't have anywhere to go.
- Hey, you're a smart guy.

19:05.252 --> 19:07.253
I'm sure you'll
figure something out.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.964
Simon, come on.

19:11.127 --> 19:12.717
I'll be okay.

19:17.848 --> 19:20.595
Now... Let's get to it.

19:20.678 --> 19:21.935
I've reviewed your statements,

19:22.019 --> 19:24.396
along with the reports of
your unsanctioned missions.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.309
And I can come to
no other conclusion

19:26.392 --> 19:29.859
that Jace Wayland is a
traitor to the Clave.

19:29.943 --> 19:31.569
Jace is not a traitor.

19:31.653 --> 19:34.614
Point of fact. Clary said Jace called
to warn you about Valentine's trap,

19:34.698 --> 19:36.241
which got me thinking...

19:36.325 --> 19:40.073
Jace had multiple chances to kill
Valentine, but chose to let him leave.

19:40.156 --> 19:43.540
Now, Valentine, Jace,
and the Cup are missing.

19:43.624 --> 19:45.166
Do the math.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.210
There is no way we're going
to help you hunt Jace.

19:47.294 --> 19:48.753
And I'd never ask you to.

19:49.749 --> 19:53.669
You and your friends are prohibited
from any further involvement

19:53.753 --> 19:55.385
for the hunt for Jace Wayland.

19:56.506 --> 19:57.554
What?

19:57.638 --> 19:59.848
The rest of you, back to work.

19:59.932 --> 20:03.518
I'm lifting the lockdown on the
Institute, except for Clary and Jocelyn.

20:03.602 --> 20:08.309
Given your relationship to Valentine and
Jace, I want to keep a close eye on you.

20:10.353 --> 20:11.354
This is ridiculous!

20:11.437 --> 20:12.527
- Clary...
- No!

20:12.611 --> 20:14.565
We cannot just sit around.

20:14.649 --> 20:17.574
Okay, they're going to kill Jace.
He's your son.

20:17.658 --> 20:20.535
I know you think you understand this
world, but you don't.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.120
Dismissed!

20:26.661 --> 20:27.750
You can't do this.

20:28.872 --> 20:31.129
See, that's the thing
about being the boss.

20:31.213 --> 20:32.375
I can and I did.

20:32.459 --> 20:35.175
Then revoke the dead-or-alive order.
Jace is one of us.

20:35.259 --> 20:39.637
Challenging the authority of the head of the
Institute is grounds for severe punishment,

20:39.721 --> 20:40.889
including de-runing.

20:57.823 --> 20:59.282
Thanks for letting
me crash here.

20:59.366 --> 21:01.951
- You're a lifesaver.
- You can stay as long as you like.

21:04.532 --> 21:06.910
I'll be at the station
when you wake up tonight.

21:06.993 --> 21:09.792
So, um, this...
This Aldertree guy...

21:09.876 --> 21:11.456
He's got issues, right?

21:11.539 --> 21:13.916
Aldertree's not the
problem, the Clave is.

21:15.882 --> 21:17.628
They're scared,
so they're clamping down.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.755
So, do you think it's true...

21:19.970 --> 21:22.484
- What they're saying about Jace?
- That he's working with Valentine?

21:22.508 --> 21:26.137
- I don't think so.
- I mean... He could come for Clary next.

21:26.351 --> 21:29.140
- He's totally hung up on her.
- So, are you worried about Jace?

21:29.724 --> 21:32.518
Or maybe telling
Clary how you feel?

21:34.484 --> 21:35.646
Be bold, Simon.

21:36.856 --> 21:39.984
I'm bold... Adjacent.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.448
I gotta take this. "Adjacent."

21:46.324 --> 21:47.575
Garroway.

21:49.124 --> 21:50.370
Bold.

21:50.453 --> 21:51.746
I can totally be bold.

22:01.089 --> 22:02.131
What's up, guys?

22:02.346 --> 22:05.510
We know Luke said you could crash here...
But not here.

22:11.182 --> 22:13.143
You don't want to touch me.

22:14.691 --> 22:16.145
<i>Encanto.</i>

22:16.360 --> 22:17.647
What the hell are you doing?

22:25.946 --> 22:29.367
It's supposed to make you
do whatever I tell you to.

22:30.201 --> 22:31.577
You're the worst vampire ever.

22:47.224 --> 22:48.349
Welcome to your new home.

23:29.802 --> 23:33.389
Left! Right! Left! Right!

23:40.980 --> 23:42.357
Impressive, aren't they?

23:42.440 --> 23:45.151
But they still don't have the
inherent gifts that you have.

23:46.068 --> 23:48.571
You took to a seraph blade the
way a baby takes to a bottle.

23:48.654 --> 23:51.574
What kind of a father experiments
on his son with pure demon blood?

23:51.788 --> 23:52.908
A father with perspective.

23:53.206 --> 23:55.327
We both want the same thing.

23:55.542 --> 23:57.205
To save this world from demons.

23:58.164 --> 24:00.916
- The Clave fights demons.
- The Clave has grown soft...

24:01.000 --> 24:03.294
Protecting Downworlders
with the Accords.

24:03.508 --> 24:06.756
All Downworlders, one day,
will give in to their violent tendencies.

24:06.839 --> 24:08.132
It's unavoidable.

24:08.346 --> 24:11.302
Even a single drop of demon
blood running in your veins,

24:11.386 --> 24:13.346
makes you a threat to humanity.

24:13.429 --> 24:16.391
I... I know plenty of Downworlders
who play by the rules.

24:16.474 --> 24:18.476
They control their urges.

24:18.559 --> 24:20.144
You're thinking of
Lucian Graymark,

24:20.358 --> 24:24.440
warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...
Clarissa's little vampire friend Simon?

24:24.654 --> 24:26.692
No matter how good
they try to be,

24:26.776 --> 24:29.862
Downworlders cannot control
their demonic blood forever.

24:31.947 --> 24:33.574
If that blood is so evil,

24:33.789 --> 24:35.743
why did you put it in me?

24:35.957 --> 24:37.787
To fight fire with fire.

24:55.471 --> 24:56.681
I wouldn't jump if I were you.

24:56.764 --> 24:58.766
Why? Because I'm
your ultimate weapon?

25:08.901 --> 25:11.654
This warlock is infamous
for crimes against mundanes.

25:11.868 --> 25:14.156
There's something else
I want you to see.

25:23.839 --> 25:25.965
- Come on, let's do this.
- Do what?

25:26.118 --> 25:28.245
You seriously want
to train right now?

25:28.328 --> 25:30.636
We have to find Jace before
Victor gets him killed.

25:45.054 --> 25:46.556
Training's important.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.313
So, pay attention to what
I'm about to show you.

26:14.416 --> 26:15.932
You need to watch your footwork.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.311
Aldertree threatened to de-rune
me if I tried to find Jace.

26:26.345 --> 26:28.820
- So, how do we get to him?
- Let's go again.

26:35.646 --> 26:37.523
Have you studied The Art of War?

26:37.607 --> 26:39.525
That was not on the
reading list at art school.

26:39.609 --> 26:42.834
You should learn it.
Sun Tzu gives excellent advice.

26:51.509 --> 26:52.913
Like what?

26:55.916 --> 26:58.585
"Move swift as the Wind and
closely-formed as the Wood."

26:58.669 --> 27:00.379
"Attack like Fire."

27:01.756 --> 27:03.145
But my favorite...

27:11.071 --> 27:14.699
"To know your enemy,
you must become your enemy."

27:26.836 --> 27:28.546
I'm a quick study.

27:54.864 --> 27:56.936
Alec, slow down.

28:00.022 --> 28:02.496
- Where are you going?
- Magnus.

28:03.067 --> 28:05.333
I couldn't just sit in
there and not do anything.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.737
He'll help me find my brother.

28:06.821 --> 28:09.670
Jace is not your brother.
He's not your blood.

28:09.754 --> 28:12.131
He's closer than blood.
He's my parabatai.

28:12.215 --> 28:14.995
Alec, we looked like fools
taking in Valentine's son,

28:15.079 --> 28:16.802
caring for him like our own.

28:17.539 --> 28:19.805
- It was the right thing to do.
- It was a mistake.

28:19.889 --> 28:22.169
It put our family in danger.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.091
You need to forget Jace.

28:27.174 --> 28:28.801
He made his choice.

28:30.427 --> 28:32.485
Do you even hear
what you're saying?

28:32.569 --> 28:34.557
If you kill him,
you kill a part of me.

28:34.640 --> 28:37.823
When you have a cancer,
you cut it out before it destroys you.

28:38.894 --> 28:39.895
Son...

28:40.660 --> 28:42.620
Life is full of hard choices.

28:44.609 --> 28:45.859
Don't kid yourself.

28:46.736 --> 28:49.293
You're not making a hard choice.
You're saving your own ass.

28:49.377 --> 28:52.755
And unlike you, I don't push someone
away just 'cause they're a hard choice.

29:17.447 --> 29:18.976
I need your help.

29:19.059 --> 29:22.410
What, we on a first name basis now?
Man, get off my docks.

29:22.980 --> 29:24.495
Oh, God, sorry.

29:32.114 --> 29:35.200
In order to know my enemy,
I had to become my enemy.

29:35.284 --> 29:36.702
I had to get out
of the Institute.

29:36.786 --> 29:39.677
Aldertree forbid me to leave.
What's with that guy?

29:39.761 --> 29:40.998
I took one of Jace's gloves

29:41.081 --> 29:42.698
to try and track him,
but it's not working.

29:42.722 --> 29:44.283
Can you see if the
police know anything?

29:44.307 --> 29:46.437
Yeah, I'll contact the Coast Guard.
See what they know.

29:46.461 --> 29:48.590
By the way,
Simon's in the supply room.

29:48.673 --> 29:49.924
- Simon's here?
- Yeah.

29:50.007 --> 29:51.939
- I'll let you know what I find.
- Thank you.

30:01.518 --> 30:04.243
Yeah. Clary's safe.
She's with me.

30:10.625 --> 30:13.739
I don't know how to do this.
I don't even know where to start.

30:13.823 --> 30:16.635
You think there'd be some sort of
handbook for the Shadow World, like...

30:16.659 --> 30:17.840
Shadowhunting for Dummies.

30:20.705 --> 30:22.845
- Thank God I found you.
- Let me guess.

30:22.929 --> 30:24.166
Luke called you.

30:24.249 --> 30:26.687
And what are you even doing here?
You're not supposed to leave either.

30:26.711 --> 30:29.310
I went to Aldertree and asked
him to let me bring you back.

30:29.394 --> 30:32.021
You told him?
I'm not going back...

30:32.105 --> 30:33.985
I know. I just said that
so he would let me out.

30:34.885 --> 30:36.941
I want to help you.
I'm here for you.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.570
We need to find Jace, right?

30:39.654 --> 30:41.030
Let's find him together.

30:41.976 --> 30:44.061
I tried tracking him with the
glove, but...

30:45.285 --> 30:48.023
Let me show you something.
Give me your phone and stele.

30:53.195 --> 30:55.669
Here are some basics
of Shadowhunting.

30:58.868 --> 30:59.910
Mom!

31:04.262 --> 31:06.931
Mom! Mom, open the door!

31:10.212 --> 31:13.716
First rule of Shadowhunting,
don't give anyone your phone or stele.

31:13.799 --> 31:15.092
Thanks.

31:44.328 --> 31:45.913
I'm not good at apologies...

31:46.831 --> 31:48.040
But I'm...

31:48.999 --> 31:50.041
I'm sorry.

31:51.543 --> 31:52.685
Continue.

31:52.769 --> 31:53.921
I'm...

31:55.463 --> 31:56.840
Really sorry.

31:58.341 --> 31:59.384
For?

32:00.593 --> 32:02.353
Look, can you just cut
that out for a second?

32:07.642 --> 32:08.642
You were right.

32:10.745 --> 32:12.580
When I called off my
wedding, that was for me.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.790
But this is all just...

32:14.874 --> 32:16.292
It's very new.

32:16.777 --> 32:19.295
This may surprise you,
but you're new for me, too.

32:21.422 --> 32:23.924
Look, with Jace missing,
it's just like...

32:24.008 --> 32:27.344
The ground has shifted,
and I can't keep my balance. Just...

32:31.541 --> 32:33.501
I didn't mean to
take it out on you.

32:35.796 --> 32:37.146
I'm sorry.

32:39.507 --> 32:40.801
You're forgiven.

32:42.845 --> 32:43.903
Also...

32:43.987 --> 32:45.597
You're great at apologies.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.647
Thanks.

32:54.731 --> 32:56.373
I've been working on it.

32:58.151 --> 32:59.652
Here's the thing...

32:59.736 --> 33:02.155
We're always going
to face challenges.

33:02.239 --> 33:03.714
So, when things get crazy,

33:03.798 --> 33:05.408
don't push me away.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.686
Simon, your phone gets no
cell service down here.

33:18.380 --> 33:21.174
That's okay.
I think I'm making progress.

33:23.443 --> 33:25.194
Simon, just stop. Okay?

33:26.096 --> 33:27.347
It's no use.

33:28.891 --> 33:30.282
We're stuck down here.

33:44.322 --> 33:46.116
I'm enjoying our together time.

33:47.951 --> 33:49.426
Reminds me of 10th grade

33:49.577 --> 33:51.762
when we snuck into my
mom's liquor cabinet.

33:51.846 --> 33:56.475
Oh, God. Oh,
it was my first wicked hangover.

33:59.187 --> 34:00.505
This is worse.

34:04.092 --> 34:06.178
- It... No, it's not.
- No...

34:09.347 --> 34:10.764
It's ridiculous.

34:10.848 --> 34:13.393
How crazy our lives have
gotten in the last few weeks.

34:13.476 --> 34:14.743
Yeah.

34:14.827 --> 34:15.995
You kill demons now.

34:16.079 --> 34:18.330
- Yeah.
- I drink blood now.

34:20.650 --> 34:22.152
And it used to be that...

34:23.152 --> 34:24.905
The biggest problem
we had was that...

34:25.862 --> 34:27.797
I was secretly and totally...

34:33.262 --> 34:36.389
Here. Track my mom with your phone.
We don't have much time.

34:38.851 --> 34:40.143
You did it.

34:43.755 --> 34:44.857
Yay for me.

34:59.106 --> 35:03.026
All right, Alec,
ready to track your parabatai?

35:30.470 --> 35:31.487
I got them.

35:33.681 --> 35:34.782
What just happened?

35:34.866 --> 35:37.019
- Did it start?
- I don't need to.

35:38.786 --> 35:40.788
I sense him. He's on land.

35:45.193 --> 35:46.919
We're stopping for pizza?

35:47.003 --> 35:49.906
Reggie served the best
pie in all of Brooklyn.

35:50.673 --> 35:52.534
Note the past tense.

35:52.617 --> 35:54.954
When Reggie's wife, Maria,
turned into a vampire,

35:55.037 --> 35:57.955
she slaughtered Reggie
and created a den inside.

36:00.417 --> 36:02.434
What does this
have to do with me?

36:06.923 --> 36:10.301
You really think love will keep you
from hurting your family and friends?

36:10.385 --> 36:12.236
No matter how hard you fight it,

36:12.320 --> 36:15.447
demon blood will make you kill.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.575
It starts in a small way.

36:18.659 --> 36:19.727
Urges.

36:20.411 --> 36:25.650
See, that's why you want Clary,
and that is why you always will.

37:26.962 --> 37:27.978
Everyone run.

37:28.062 --> 37:29.354
Get out. Out, now.

37:29.438 --> 37:30.939
Hey, out!

37:36.696 --> 37:38.280
Which one of you is Maria?

37:39.141 --> 37:40.240
Who's asking?

38:15.526 --> 38:17.179
Jace is back. Call off your men.

38:17.262 --> 38:19.782
- Izzy and I will bring him back alive.
- One step ahead of you.

38:19.847 --> 38:21.550
We got a hit on the map.
We're mobilizing now.

38:21.574 --> 38:24.060
You're not listening.
Go ahead and de-rune me.

38:24.144 --> 38:25.327
We won't let you do this.

38:26.771 --> 38:28.163
Hold them here
until we get back.

38:31.443 --> 38:34.503
I'm sorry.
I'll do what I can to help Jace.

39:28.708 --> 39:31.310
Pretty strong,
even for a Shadowhunter.

39:31.394 --> 39:33.421
You're feeding on
innocent mundanes.

39:37.384 --> 39:39.151
A girl's gotta eat.

39:45.099 --> 39:46.893
- Your mom's close.
- Then run faster!

39:46.976 --> 39:49.061
I'm a vampire.
I'm running slow for you.

39:58.129 --> 40:00.339
You're done. You're done.

40:00.423 --> 40:02.758
- You can't kill me.
- Watch me.

40:02.842 --> 40:05.552
I surrender to the
authority of the Clave.

40:10.850 --> 40:12.294
Aw, look at you.

40:12.377 --> 40:16.688
You got your stick all ready
to go and now you can't use it.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.234
No, you broke the Accords.

40:21.318 --> 40:23.987
You killed innocent mundanes.
And now, you're gonna die

40:24.071 --> 40:26.573
- just like your friends.
- But unlike them,

40:26.657 --> 40:29.519
I'm no longer a threat.

40:29.602 --> 40:30.702
I know my rights.

40:30.786 --> 40:33.398
- Your rights?
- Yeah, my rights.

40:33.481 --> 40:36.625
I might have broken the
Accords, but I know you won't.

40:36.709 --> 40:38.877
You don't know
anything about me.

40:41.088 --> 40:42.574
I know you're weak.

40:44.784 --> 40:46.411
I can smell it.

40:46.494 --> 40:49.414
And you'll do whatever
the Clave tells you to do.

40:49.497 --> 40:51.932
- Now, get off of me.
- Jonathan.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.810
Are you going to let her
mock you after what she did?

40:55.936 --> 40:57.396
This thing in front of you...

40:59.131 --> 41:03.902
She was once Reggie the pizza
guy's sweet and loving wife.

41:03.986 --> 41:07.489
- You leave my husband out of this!
- Whoa. You mean the man you murdered?

41:07.573 --> 41:09.199
You mean the man you devoured?

41:09.283 --> 41:10.492
That's what you mean.

41:22.071 --> 41:23.422
Ah, that's my boy.

41:36.811 --> 41:38.087
No!

41:39.772 --> 41:41.633
Run, Jonathan.
They want you dead.

41:48.014 --> 41:49.015
Mom, stop!

41:56.313 --> 41:57.690
What have you done?

41:59.750 --> 42:05.750
