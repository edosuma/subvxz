WEBVTT

00:06.539 --> 00:09.770
I'm telling you, Ashley,
it's the perfect thing for Granny's visit.

00:09.843 --> 00:13.244
Look, we enter here,
we go past the Ilamas and giraffes...

00:13.313 --> 00:14.803
take a look at the monkey house...

00:14.881 --> 00:17.076
and then end
with a ride on the Ferris wheel.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.447
For the last time...

00:18.518 --> 00:21.351
we are not breaking into
Michael Jackson's house.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.417
Man, what's up?

00:26.493 --> 00:28.825
We're picking up Grandma
from the airport.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.693
She won't want to hear that garbage
when she gets here.

00:31.765 --> 00:35.223
The reason you don't like the music
is because you can't dance.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.402
Really?

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:47.313 --> 00:48.837
In your face.

02:00.820 --> 02:03.550
So it turned out I did get an "A"
in my English mid-term...

02:03.623 --> 02:05.523
and the A minus was in Math.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.389
What a crazy week that was.

02:09.027 --> 02:11.997
That takes us up to the spring quarter.
That's when l...

02:12.065 --> 02:15.296
Worked hard, got good grades,
made the honor roll, the end.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.566
Granny!

02:18.371 --> 02:19.531
Oh, sugar!

02:20.607 --> 02:22.802
Will, as handsome as ever.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.307
Grandma, as generous as ever.

02:26.913 --> 02:30.644
Did you notice how Carlton's grown?
He's almost into adult sizes.

02:33.253 --> 02:35.221
Congratulations, dear.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.319
I've been looking through
the guidebooks...

02:38.391 --> 02:40.985
I found an attraction
with your name written all over it.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.585
- What's that, honey?
- Raging Waters.

02:45.598 --> 02:48.431
- Are you insane?
- It's a little late to be asking.

02:49.636 --> 02:52.730
She's here to rest and recuperate.
She's just gotten over the flu.

02:52.805 --> 02:54.773
I told you it was a cold.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.441
What did the doctor say?

02:56.509 --> 03:01.469
Us country folks don't run to the doctor
at every sneeze, sniffle, or broken bone.

03:02.782 --> 03:05.615
We are not the spendthrifts you are, Zeke.

03:06.653 --> 03:09.520
Zeke. That one always kills me.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.852
Granny, I love when you come to visit.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.554
Did you bring the picture of him
and the goat?

03:16.162 --> 03:18.323
Never leave home without it.

03:22.735 --> 03:25.203
Yes, sir, I'll be getting a frame for this one.

03:26.439 --> 03:27.633
Hattie.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.334
Hello!

03:33.313 --> 03:36.771
Honey, you are younger and prettier
every time I see you.

03:37.951 --> 03:40.476
Will you look at you two?

03:40.553 --> 03:43.647
- You could enter a beauty contest.
- Grandma.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.951
Really?

03:47.327 --> 03:49.227
I never gave it much thought.

03:49.762 --> 03:52.993
Just think, for the talent portion,
you could twirl a checkbook.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.028
Grandma, are we gonna do
some more crafts while you're here?

03:58.104 --> 03:59.969
We sure are.

04:00.673 --> 04:01.901
Geoffrey!

04:02.575 --> 04:03.735
Yes, madam?

04:03.977 --> 04:06.411
Ashley and I
are going to be doing some art.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.175
We're going to need 50 Popsicle sticks...

04:09.249 --> 04:12.616
two bags of macaroni wheels,
and lots and lots of glitter.

04:13.052 --> 04:16.613
I'm way ahead of you.
In anticipation of your visit...

04:16.689 --> 04:18.850
I have saved two dozen egg cartons.

04:19.591 --> 04:23.221
Thank you, Geoffrey,
but we won't be making purses this time.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.790
Speaking of art, I thought
we could go to the museum.

04:27.867 --> 04:30.392
They have a display on 100-year-old quilts.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.431
I got one of them in the back of my truck.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.107
I know what'd be perfect for Grandma:

04:36.175 --> 04:38.200
A complete day of beauty
where the salon...

04:38.278 --> 04:41.509
does your hair, makeup, nails,
and you come out looking fabulous.

04:41.581 --> 04:43.981
I don't think your grandmother
would be interested.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.415
Then can I do it?

04:46.386 --> 04:50.049
I know we all have plans for Grandma,
but let her relax a little bit first.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.886
Sweetie, I feel fine.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.721
Maybe so, Mama, but...

04:53.793 --> 04:55.886
while you're here
I want you to take it easy.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.123
You are not to lift a finger.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.231
We're gonna treat you like a queen.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.830
You said the magic words.

05:23.589 --> 05:24.749
Excuse me.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.985
Did I just win the Kentucky Derby?

05:29.329 --> 05:33.060
Mr. Banks instructed me
to keep you warm at all times.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.899
Why don't you just light me on fire?

05:37.503 --> 05:40.472
I'm already hotter
than a dog in a wool wagon.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.133
Now git!

05:42.308 --> 05:44.503
While the gitting's good, madam.

05:46.579 --> 05:48.206
Granny, what you doing?

05:48.481 --> 05:50.210
Nothing much, I'm afraid.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.843
Your uncle gave me this book
of find-the-word puzzles.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.849
So I found all the words.

05:55.988 --> 05:57.785
Now what do I do with them?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.689
You shouldn't just be sitting here.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.228
You should do something
you like doing, like...

06:03.296 --> 06:04.490
I don't know...

06:04.564 --> 06:06.464
baking me a sweet potato pie.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.971
Baby, much as I'd like to,
I think your uncle wants me to stay put.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.973
Now that's your first mistake.

06:15.074 --> 06:17.440
He tells me all kinds of stuff to do...

06:18.010 --> 06:19.739
and I never listen to him.

06:20.613 --> 06:22.604
And I'm a better person for it.

06:23.983 --> 06:26.975
How come you're just sitting around?
Don't you have any plans?

06:27.186 --> 06:28.483
No, not really.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.548
You got to have a girl.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.951
No kidding.

06:36.295 --> 06:38.923
There's no one that gets your sap rising?

06:41.000 --> 06:44.026
There's this girl named Tanya,
I met her at the mall.

06:44.103 --> 06:48.039
She works in a fancy men's store where
even the underwear comes from Europe.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.839
I don't know if she'd go out
with anybody in local drawers.

06:54.614 --> 06:57.549
Sets to mind a heifer we once had.

06:57.950 --> 06:59.577
You ain't seen Tanya.

07:00.286 --> 07:01.548
You listen up.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.681
Petunia had two bulls liking her.

07:05.258 --> 07:09.092
One a big strong Angus
with a chest as wide as a Chevy.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.420
That one's me, right?

07:12.865 --> 07:17.165
The other was a slim, handsome Jersey.
A real lady's bull.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.831
Word to Granny. That one's me, right?

07:21.841 --> 07:24.901
All season long,
Petunia just couldn't decide.

07:26.045 --> 07:29.446
So come fall, she ups and picks the Angus.

07:30.349 --> 07:31.475
See?

07:32.985 --> 07:34.077
No.

07:35.421 --> 07:38.219
By then, breeding season was over.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.019
Maybe if you changed it
to cats or something.

07:45.598 --> 07:48.066
Everybody be quiet.
Grandma's probably sleeping.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.965
She's going to love my gift.

07:51.704 --> 07:54.002
I didn't know Leonard Nimoy even sang.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.635
- That was very thoughtful, Carlton.
- Thank you.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.474
I smell something funny.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.182
It smells like pine or something.

08:04.317 --> 08:07.377
I smell it, too.
I thinks it's coming from the kitchen.

08:12.458 --> 08:13.891
What is that smell?

08:13.960 --> 08:16.485
Watch your step. The floor is wet.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.193
Mother, what are you doing?

08:19.265 --> 08:21.563
I'm picking apples from a cherry tree.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.894
What does it look like I'm doing?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.535
I'm giving your floor
a good hand scrubbing.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.972
- That's Geoffrey's job.
- No, it ain't.

08:30.643 --> 08:32.907
I have begun the mulch pile, madam.

08:34.080 --> 08:38.039
Fine, I'll be out to look at it directly,
right after I flip the mattresses.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.379
Hold on, Mama.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.818
Sorry, sir, but she threatened me
with a whupping.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.889
It seems like you're back to your old self.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.828
I have an idea for this afternoon.
I know how proud you are of your azaleas.

08:51.898 --> 08:55.493
Why don't we go to the botanical gardens
and see how theirs stack up?

08:55.902 --> 08:58.928
- I'll get my sweater.
- Why? Mama, you cold?

08:59.138 --> 09:00.332
Geoffrey, turn up the heat.

09:00.406 --> 09:05.105
Sir, I already set the thermostat on 80
as you requested.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.304
The candles are starting to melt.

09:08.948 --> 09:11.974
I just wanted my sweater
because we are going to the gardens.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.144
We can go to the garden later this week.

09:14.420 --> 09:15.978
I want you to get settled in.

09:16.055 --> 09:19.115
I am more settled
than a big old box of raisin bran.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.156
Mama, don't excite yourself.
Is there anything I can get for you?

09:24.230 --> 09:25.925
- How about a magazine?
- Or a game.

09:25.998 --> 09:27.727
Or some moisturizer.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.796
I have an idea.
Why don't we all take a dip in the pool?

09:33.039 --> 09:34.063
Sounds good.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.836
That way we can all get out
and let Mama take a nap.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.376
I want to swim, too.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.469
You shouldn't swim
when getting over the flu.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.446
We'll see you after your nap.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.481
Nap!

09:50.356 --> 09:52.517
Why don't they put me in a playpen?

09:53.993 --> 09:55.358
Yo, DJ Granny.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.930
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

10:02.134 --> 10:04.534
And your uncle aims to keep it that way.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.005
I know he means well...

10:08.507 --> 10:10.441
but a body has to feel useful.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.001
Useful?

10:12.078 --> 10:15.206
You know that girlie advice you gave me?
It worked like a charm.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.407
Really?

10:16.682 --> 10:18.309
I don't remember it exactly...

10:18.384 --> 10:20.750
but I just walked up to her and said:

10:20.820 --> 10:24.381
"Bulls and cows need to get together
before it starts snowing."

10:29.996 --> 10:31.691
And she understood that?

10:32.164 --> 10:34.029
No, but she liked my hair.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.163
We're going out on her first night off.

10:38.537 --> 10:40.027
That's fine.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.239
But I don't have a date
for the concert tonight.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.368
- Who's playing?
- Heavy D.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.276
I love him.

10:47.513 --> 10:48.707
You do?

10:49.015 --> 10:51.108
Who doesn't like Charlie Daniels?

10:53.219 --> 10:55.847
This is another Heavy D, Granny.

10:55.921 --> 10:59.152
Maybe if I play this tape for you.
Check it out.

11:06.799 --> 11:08.096
Not bad.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.260
Can't understand what he's saying...

11:10.336 --> 11:12.270
but it does have a beat to it.

11:12.705 --> 11:14.832
What kind of dance you do to this?

11:15.141 --> 11:16.403
Trust me on this one.

11:16.475 --> 11:20.070
It's very complicated. It takes
a lot of hard study and dedication to learn.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.410
Honey, I ain't got that kind of time.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.448
You're getting there!

11:35.961 --> 11:38.589
This kind of dancing
works up quite an appetite.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.825
What say I make us some flapjacks?

11:41.667 --> 11:43.601
Granny, will you marry me?

11:45.538 --> 11:47.005
Sweet talker!

11:47.840 --> 11:49.432
This is the good part.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.237
I'll turn up the Victrola.

11:51.877 --> 11:52.935
Yeah!

11:53.979 --> 11:55.879
Go, Granny.

11:55.948 --> 11:57.643
What's going on in here?

11:58.317 --> 11:59.807
Mama, are you all right?

11:59.885 --> 12:02.410
Of course I am. Take your hands off of me.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.949
Will, why were you playing that music?

12:06.025 --> 12:08.994
Grandma's supposed to be resting.
You're grounded.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.723
Grounded? All I did
was play some music loud.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.228
Sounds more like
a no-dessert offense, isn't it?

12:16.302 --> 12:17.894
You heard what I said.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.668
All right, Uncle Philip...

12:20.740 --> 12:23.573
I got backstage passes
to the Heavy D concert.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.110
You say yourself how awful rap music is.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.176
Let's say we make that my punishment.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.511
Please don't make me go.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.582
Nice try, Will.

12:35.821 --> 12:39.518
Don't get so worked up.
I was just having fun.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.459
Mama, a woman your age
should not be dancing around.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.222
Boy, don't you tell me what to do.

12:46.132 --> 12:49.329
I'm sorry. I was just trying
to look out for you.

12:49.568 --> 12:52.435
Will, no more horsing around.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.834
"Will, no more horsing around."

12:59.678 --> 13:02.670
That boy is about as much fun
as day-old oatmeal.

13:03.415 --> 13:04.712
I noticed that.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.017
Granny, since we're both grounded...

13:08.087 --> 13:11.454
want to go upstairs, slam
our bedroom doors, and throw things?

13:11.857 --> 13:14.155
A woman my age shouldn't be dancing.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.084
We'll see about that.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.127
Spoiling my fun.

13:18.531 --> 13:19.555
Yours?

13:19.765 --> 13:22.029
I can't believe
I'm not going to that concert.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.035
You are going to that concert.

13:24.503 --> 13:26.198
- I am?
- That's right.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.430
With me.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.502
But Uncle Phil won't let us.

13:30.576 --> 13:32.271
Uncle Phil won't see us.

13:34.113 --> 13:35.580
Sneaking out? You?

13:35.981 --> 13:39.109
Honey, you are looking at a woman...

13:39.185 --> 13:42.154
who has snuck out to more barn dances...

13:42.221 --> 13:46.681
hayrides, and midnight skinny-dips
than a chicken has pecks.

13:52.832 --> 13:53.924
All right!

14:03.175 --> 14:05.268
Looks like you've got plans
for the evening.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.504
Yeah.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.544
Got me a couple of extra pillows.

14:08.614 --> 14:10.582
I like to turn in early at my age.

14:10.649 --> 14:13.209
- Would you like some hot chocolate?
- Lord, no!

14:13.285 --> 14:15.082
Don't need the stimulation.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.619
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.058
That was close.

14:31.237 --> 14:32.761
But I was cool.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.805
Good work 0070.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.838
Now here's the plan.
The concert starts at 8:00.

14:40.913 --> 14:43.381
My friend Jazz
will meet us at the corner at 7:00.

14:43.449 --> 14:47.010
He'll flash his lights twice,
then drive us to the Bel-Air border.

14:47.119 --> 14:50.850
There, we'll meet with a guy
known only as the Captain.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.759
He'll drive us the rest of the way.
No questions asked.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.419
What's the code words?

14:57.396 --> 14:58.920
Here's $10.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.661
Got you.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.860
You're going to be ready to go?

15:06.372 --> 15:07.464
No problem.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.069
Good, you'll blend in.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.011
I brought these pillows
to put them in our beds...

15:18.083 --> 15:19.983
so they think we're sleeping.

15:22.521 --> 15:25.649
Nice try, but today
it's all done electronically.

15:27.393 --> 15:28.792
Check it.

15:37.903 --> 15:39.427
That's lovely, dear.

15:49.148 --> 15:50.342
My brother...

15:51.150 --> 15:54.119
for the last time, she is not Queen Latifah.

16:01.527 --> 16:02.926
Finally we're here.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.021
For a minute, I thought Uncle Phil
saw us out that window.

16:06.098 --> 16:08.396
What a hideous expression on his face.

16:08.534 --> 16:11.469
Word. Thank God he just had
a mouthful of Gummy Bears.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.102
You want to sit down?

16:14.173 --> 16:16.698
Don't you start treating me
like an old person.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.567
What do we do first?

16:18.644 --> 16:20.544
Buy T-shirts and get something to eat.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.547
Good idea.
I think we can both use some chilidogs...

16:23.615 --> 16:26.209
with lots of cheese. Listen, I'm paying.

16:26.585 --> 16:29.213
Granny, that marriage proposal
still stands.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.120
What do you mean
your grandma wasn't in her room?

16:35.194 --> 16:36.559
I went to tell her good night...

16:36.628 --> 16:38.596
there were just pillows under the covers.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.428
Where on earth
would she get an idea like that?

16:44.003 --> 16:45.095
Will!

16:53.445 --> 16:55.436
How could he still be sleeping?

17:01.253 --> 17:02.345
Look at this.

17:02.421 --> 17:05.219
I can't believe how low Will will stoop
to deceive you.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.316
With this tape, who knows
how many times he could sneak out...

17:08.394 --> 17:10.760
for a whole night completely unnoticed.

17:15.334 --> 17:19.361
- You think Will and Grandma are all right?
- I'm sure they are.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.065
Okay, I'm going to bed.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.299
I don't understand.
Where would they be at this hour?

17:25.377 --> 17:26.867
The Heavy D concert.

17:28.981 --> 17:31.882
I accidentally
overheard Will on the phone...

17:31.950 --> 17:34.316
when I was trying to clean my receiver.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.320
Will probably
dragged my mother with him.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.326
- I'm going down there.
- I'm going with you. It's a rap concert.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.295
You want to be with someone
who knows how to be hip.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.168
$10 for a T-shirt. That boy must be crazy.

17:54.106 --> 17:58.372
I still ain't sure how you managed to get it
for $1.25 and a picture of Grandpa.

18:00.813 --> 18:03.976
I've been thinking.
Maybe we should call home.

18:04.216 --> 18:06.480
I know how it is. I've been a parent.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.350
I've been a kid, and the answer is...

18:09.421 --> 18:10.820
bad choice, Joyce.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.957
I mean, they'd kill us.

18:15.394 --> 18:16.759
Twice over.

18:19.465 --> 18:20.989
I'm sorry to bother you.

18:21.066 --> 18:22.431
Miss Fitzgerald?

18:22.801 --> 18:24.462
I'm a big fan of yours.

18:25.137 --> 18:27.469
Can I have your picture taken with me?

18:27.539 --> 18:28.938
Come on, she's not...

18:29.007 --> 18:31.134
Ever too busy for a fan.

18:38.383 --> 18:41.648
They had backstage passes.
It shouldn't be too hard to find them.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.654
Let's hurry up. This is weird.

18:44.189 --> 18:46.214
Can you believe how these kids dress?

18:46.291 --> 18:48.122
It's beginning to get to me.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.358
Excuse me a moment. I just...

19:03.041 --> 19:05.202
Could I see your backstage pass, please?

19:05.277 --> 19:08.075
I don't have one.
I'm here looking for my mother.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.747
And your sister knows
a member of the band, right?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.784
You groupies are all alike.

19:13.919 --> 19:15.682
I am not a groupie.

19:16.121 --> 19:20.387
Call it what you like, but take it from me,
Heavy D doesn't want to hear you rap.

19:23.061 --> 19:25.086
Where do you think you're going?

19:26.465 --> 19:27.625
Pardon me.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.429
Have you seen a kid
in wild, colorful clothing...

19:30.502 --> 19:33.437
with an earring in his ear
and the sides of his head shaved?

19:39.211 --> 19:40.405
Nope.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.109
You better get to your seat,
the concert's about to start.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.652
I'm not here to see some stupid concert.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.812
Never mind. I'll find him myself.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.013
He couldn't have gotten too far.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.462
<i>Everybody, put your hands together
for Heavy D!</i>

20:02.768 --> 20:03.928
Boo!

20:10.742 --> 20:14.337
When the crowd saw
he wasn't Heavy D, they was upset.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.905
Uncle Phil, you had
the shortest rap career in history.

20:20.485 --> 20:22.214
But I do feel bad.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.555
All the trouble we caused you.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.118
Yeah, you're right. Me, too.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.117
Oh, well!

20:34.866 --> 20:37.426
You all should've seen Granny.
She was great.

20:37.603 --> 20:40.037
She climbed down
from the second story window...

20:40.105 --> 20:42.130
then she ran to Jazz's car...

20:42.207 --> 20:44.835
then helped push it up the hill
when it stalled.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.000
Philip, I think you're right.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.344
I don't think Hattie's up to
seeing those azaleas tomorrow.

20:50.682 --> 20:53.150
Why, I sure am, and after that...

20:53.218 --> 20:55.686
Hilary and I are going to get those facials.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.781
Grandma, you haven't lived
until you've had a mud mask.

21:00.025 --> 21:02.687
What people don't pay for in Beverly Hills.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.855
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.433
And then, Ashley, baby...

21:10.502 --> 21:14.598
you and I are going to make us
some macaroni rain hats.

21:14.673 --> 21:15.765
Great!

21:15.841 --> 21:18.332
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night, precious.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.736
After all that activity,
you're going to need a rest.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.809
That's when you can tell me
more about your schoolwork, dear.

21:27.719 --> 21:28.811
Excellent!

21:29.388 --> 21:31.754
- Good night, Grandma.
- Good night, baby.

21:32.357 --> 21:35.417
You know, Granny,
you were a great date tonight.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.519
You showed me a great time.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.524
And to thank you...

21:39.598 --> 21:43.625
tomorrow I'm going to bake you
a sweet potato pie.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.601
Granny, I don't think
you should be waking up all early.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.771
Let's get started on it now.

21:53.679 --> 21:55.738
Will, I think it's time for bed.

21:55.947 --> 21:57.608
- Good night, Granny.
- Good night, baby.

21:57.683 --> 21:59.776
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, darling.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.487
Don't go giving me that look, Zeke.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.257
That's the same look you give me
at the county fair...

22:13.332 --> 22:16.130
when I wouldn't
let you climb up the greasy pole.

22:17.569 --> 22:20.936
Now, you're not
all that mad with me, are you?

22:21.773 --> 22:23.673
Mama, yes, I am.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.775
I try to set some rules down for Will...

22:27.012 --> 22:29.003
and you undermined my authority.

22:29.181 --> 22:31.513
I know how to handle things.
I am an adult.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.107
I am, too, Zeke.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.445
- I know that.
- Do you?

22:36.355 --> 22:38.823
How many adults do you tell
to take a nap?

22:40.125 --> 22:42.650
Mama, I was just worried about you.

22:43.428 --> 22:45.953
But I'm fine, baby.

22:47.332 --> 22:48.492
I know.

22:50.068 --> 22:53.196
When you had the flu
and I talked to you on the phone...

22:54.005 --> 22:55.529
you sounded so small.

22:58.243 --> 23:00.438
I just want you to live a long time.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.076
Then, Zeke...

23:05.350 --> 23:06.578
let me live.
