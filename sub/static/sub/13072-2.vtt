WEBVTT

00:00.650 --> 00:02.377
Previously on Guilt...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.219
Grace, what did you do?

00:11.220 --> 00:12.261
I don't care if they

00:12.262 --> 00:13.387
found Grace standing over the body

00:13.388 --> 00:15.014
with a bloody knife in her hand.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.058
I know my sister is innocent.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.601
Never underestimate jealous girls.

00:18.602 --> 00:21.103
Grace said that Molly

00:21.104 --> 00:22.104
thought she was being watched,

00:22.105 --> 00:23.272
that someone was stealing her stuff.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.024
You want someone to pay for

00:25.025 --> 00:26.025
what happened to your sister.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.485
You have to trust the system.

00:27.486 --> 00:29.153
What was Grace's dead roommate doing

00:29.154 --> 00:30.238
with the scarf I gave you
last Christmas?

00:30.239 --> 00:33.241
Well, I don't like
what you're insinuating.

00:33.242 --> 00:34.909
You need to give yourself
permission to mourn.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.244
How about you, Professor?

00:36.245 --> 00:37.722
Will you be mourning Molly?

00:37.723 --> 00:39.497
What Scotland Yard needs to do

00:39.498 --> 00:41.123
is stop wasting time

00:41.124 --> 00:42.870
harassing an innocent,

00:42.871 --> 00:45.169
terrified young girl,

00:45.170 --> 00:47.463
and start trying to find
the sadistic butcher

00:47.464 --> 00:49.632
who killed Molly Ryan.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.635
I think you're ready.

00:52.636 --> 00:55.060
Luckily, a case
this dirty, there is plenty

00:55.085 --> 00:57.224
of guilt to go around.

00:58.509 --> 01:00.468
- Uh...
- I'm Molly Ryan.

01:00.469 --> 01:01.928
And I'm Grace Atwood.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.638
An Irish girl
and an American chick do London.

01:04.640 --> 01:08.309
We are visiting the home
of the Queen of England.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.644
I really need to pee.

01:11.647 --> 01:13.231
Would she let me use her loo?

01:13.232 --> 01:15.483
Why are we even watching this?

01:15.484 --> 01:17.318
It's just a stupid travel vlog.

01:17.319 --> 01:18.611
Guessing Stan didn't

01:18.612 --> 01:20.530
wake us up at the crack of dawn
for nothing.

01:20.531 --> 01:22.282
That Harvard education
wasn't lost on you.

01:22.283 --> 01:26.452
Unless we cough up 15, 000 quid,
this little beauty goes viral.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.371
- Turn it off.
- No, come on, we were just

01:28.372 --> 01:29.582
getting to the good part.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.542
Grace.

01:36.505 --> 01:37.922
- Why is he texting you?
- Give me...

01:37.923 --> 01:39.075
Give me the phone, Grace.

01:39.075 --> 01:40.842
- Why is he texting you?
- Give it here.

01:40.843 --> 01:42.218
- ... the phone.
- Are you seeing him?

01:42.219 --> 01:44.053
- No, of course not.
- Give it to me.

01:44.054 --> 01:45.388
- Ow, you're hurting me!
- You are, aren't you?

01:45.389 --> 01:46.764
- Ow! Stop!
- You're screwing him!

01:46.765 --> 01:49.435
Ow! Grace, stop!

02:00.324 --> 02:03.493
I know it looks bad, but
I swear, I didn't hurt Molly.

02:03.494 --> 02:05.745
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
she said you were hurting her.

02:05.746 --> 02:06.997
Yeah, well, she was overreacting.

02:06.998 --> 02:08.455
We laughed about it later.

02:08.457 --> 02:10.667
I don't care if you
two made friendship bracelets

02:10.668 --> 02:13.295
and pinky swore you'd never fight again.

02:13.296 --> 02:14.963
You look like you want to kill her.

02:14.964 --> 02:17.299
Which means everyone will assume
that you did.

02:17.300 --> 02:19.301
We have to make this go away.

02:19.302 --> 02:20.261
Do you know who sent it?

02:20.262 --> 02:22.012
I'm working on it.

02:22.013 --> 02:24.014
It's got to be Stephanie
from our lit class.

02:24.015 --> 02:25.390
We gave her our videos to edit.

02:25.391 --> 02:28.184
She knows how to make stuff look cool.

02:28.185 --> 02:31.396
Molly thought that when
they went up, we'd be famous.

02:31.397 --> 02:33.523
More like infamous.

02:33.524 --> 02:35.191
All right, now...

02:35.192 --> 02:38.111
before I go clean up this stinking turd,

02:38.112 --> 02:41.239
I need to know what else
I'm gonna step in with you.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.283
- Nothing.
- Are you sure?

02:43.284 --> 02:46.202
Molly Ryan's murder
is like news cycle crack.

02:46.203 --> 02:48.663
This girl's not the only creep
who's gonna try to exploit you.

02:48.664 --> 02:51.082
Every idiotic thing you ever did, said

02:51.083 --> 02:54.127
or vomited on social media
will come back to haunt you.

02:54.128 --> 02:56.964
I need to know if there's
any other bombs out there.

02:59.183 --> 02:59.891
No.

03:00.760 --> 03:01.834
There's nothing else.

03:02.661 --> 03:03.679
All right.

03:05.348 --> 03:07.807
Well, I'm gonna go bury this.

03:07.808 --> 03:09.927
You're gonna keep
your butt in this room.

03:10.227 --> 03:12.396
But it's Molly's memorial today.
I have to go.

03:12.770 --> 03:13.980
That's a good one.

03:13.981 --> 03:15.775
Like I'm gonna let her do that.

03:20.279 --> 03:22.405
You know, her friend died.

03:22.406 --> 03:24.617
Could you act like
a human being for a minute?

03:27.036 --> 03:29.616
Grace will look guiltier
if she's not there.

03:29.616 --> 03:32.458
We want people to forget
Grace even exists.

03:32.459 --> 03:34.417
That memorial is gonna be
swarming with press.

03:34.418 --> 03:37.587
Last thing Grace needs are
some talking heads debating

03:37.588 --> 03:41.424
whether her short skirt makes
her look like a murderous slut.

03:41.425 --> 03:43.635
I don't even want her walking
down the hallway to get ice,

03:43.636 --> 03:44.637
you got it?

03:46.000 --> 03:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:54.271 --> 03:55.179
I'm going.

03:55.773 --> 03:57.163
I don't care what he says.

03:58.609 --> 03:59.693
We'll go together.

04:00.587 --> 04:01.899
It'll be fine.

04:07.368 --> 04:08.618
Grace...

04:10.329 --> 04:12.114
who was texting Molly?

04:13.499 --> 04:15.163
You were so pissed.

04:16.418 --> 04:17.709
Was it Luc?

04:17.711 --> 04:18.481
No.

04:19.213 --> 04:21.297
I was totally wrong. It was nothing.

04:21.298 --> 04:23.467
Well, whatever it was, I need to know.

04:23.467 --> 04:25.677
Might come back to bite us.

04:26.721 --> 04:28.033
Here's the thing.

04:28.723 --> 04:32.392
Molly was kind of...
she was kind of a flirt.

04:32.393 --> 04:34.102
She liked older guys, and...

04:34.103 --> 04:36.313
Oh, my God, this is so stupid.

04:36.793 --> 04:37.857
James was in town a lot,

04:37.857 --> 04:39.733
so when I saw that he texted her, I...

04:39.734 --> 04:41.693
James? James was texting Molly?

04:41.694 --> 04:43.081
No, it was nothing like that.

04:43.611 --> 04:45.531
She was helping him
pick out my birthday present.

04:47.283 --> 04:49.367
- He got me this.
- You bought that?

04:49.368 --> 04:51.620
No, I didn't buy that. It was the truth.

04:54.290 --> 04:57.333
Besides, who else was he gonna ask?

04:57.334 --> 04:59.420
It's not like you were gonna help him.

05:29.492 --> 05:32.952
I thought we said we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

05:34.497 --> 05:36.915
Why don't we just stop saying

05:36.916 --> 05:39.209
that we're not gonna do this anymore?

05:39.210 --> 05:40.211
Hmm?

05:50.846 --> 05:52.472
You two carpool or something?

05:52.473 --> 05:53.973
You don't think Madam Prosecutor

05:53.974 --> 05:55.891
would want to hitch a ride
in my crappy car, do you?

05:55.892 --> 05:57.811
Look, in five minutes, I've got to go

05:57.812 --> 06:00.021
convince my boss
that we're making some progress

06:00.022 --> 06:02.273
in the Molly Ryan murder
investigation, so please

06:02.274 --> 06:03.775
give me something I can use.

06:03.776 --> 06:05.276
Still trying to confirm whether

06:05.277 --> 06:08.029
Molly was shagging
our naughty professor.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.448
He's been at his brother's
cottage in Kent since

06:10.449 --> 06:13.284
the tire slashing on the news,
but I want to get him

06:13.285 --> 06:16.246
in here today to get
a statement out of him.

06:16.247 --> 06:18.445
Any leads on who else
the baby daddy might be?

06:18.958 --> 06:20.667
Well, if Molly's friends know anything,

06:20.668 --> 06:22.085
they're keeping their traps shut.

06:22.086 --> 06:23.503
And the lab are taking their sweet time

06:23.504 --> 06:25.861
in getting us any fetal DNA results.

06:26.590 --> 06:29.217
I think that Luc Pascal
is a good candidate.

06:29.218 --> 06:31.177
Call me old-fashioned,
but I like to think

06:31.178 --> 06:32.011
that a lap dance
still counts for something.

06:32.012 --> 06:34.389
Yeah, but Mr. Lap Dance,
he's got an alibi.

06:34.390 --> 06:36.213
Grace Atwood.

06:36.809 --> 06:38.686
And he is hers.

06:39.007 --> 06:40.975
It's all pretty flimsy in my book.

06:43.186 --> 06:45.441
Maybe they killed her together.

06:45.442 --> 06:47.569
Or Luc is protecting Grace.

06:47.570 --> 06:50.280
If Grace saw that lap dance,
she might have snapped.

06:50.281 --> 06:53.324
See, but what I'm stuck on
is Molly's missing phone.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.494
A girl like that, her phone is
super-glued to her hand.

06:56.495 --> 06:57.996
And the phone isn't
the only thing missing.

06:57.997 --> 07:00.531
Grace said that Molly thought
someone was watching her,

07:00.532 --> 07:01.729
stealing her things.

07:01.730 --> 07:03.251
Now Molly's stuffed monkey's

07:03.252 --> 07:04.670
been stolen from the crime scene.

07:05.487 --> 07:07.069
That's what you've got for me?

07:07.423 --> 07:09.179
A missing monkey?

07:09.508 --> 07:12.010
So, the media vultures are right,

07:12.011 --> 07:14.930
and we've got bugger all
to make an arrest.

07:30.654 --> 07:31.739
Hey.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.053
Hey.

07:34.658 --> 07:36.710
First night's always the hardest.

07:38.069 --> 07:39.942
I'm sorry I freaked out.

07:40.822 --> 07:42.677
I just didn't think he'd ask...

07:44.526 --> 07:45.438
for that.

07:45.952 --> 07:48.579
I meant what I said when I told you

07:48.580 --> 07:51.748
you don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

07:51.749 --> 07:54.376
Your boss seemed really pissed off.

07:54.377 --> 07:56.545
He said the client refused to pay,

07:56.546 --> 08:00.765
and I-I cost the club,
like, a bunch of money.

08:01.301 --> 08:02.461
I'll handle Finch.

08:03.344 --> 08:04.479
Oh.

08:04.888 --> 08:08.265
This is what your cut would've been

08:08.266 --> 08:10.852
if that wanker hadn't stiffed us.

08:13.770 --> 08:15.354
Seriously?

08:15.355 --> 08:16.501
You earned it.

08:17.514 --> 08:19.358
But it's just paper, Kaley.

08:19.359 --> 08:20.610
Yeah.

08:20.611 --> 08:22.820
It's not worth it
if going back to the club

08:22.821 --> 08:24.475
takes something from you.

08:25.324 --> 08:27.200
Something special.

08:31.955 --> 08:34.666
It's kind of a lot of paper though.

08:46.178 --> 08:47.520
Hey, I'm gonna run out for a bit.

08:47.545 --> 08:48.919
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

08:48.944 --> 08:51.379
I want to finish picking photos
for Molly's memorial.

08:51.379 --> 08:52.470
Okay.

09:09.264 --> 09:10.473
Luc.

09:10.474 --> 09:12.558
Why won't you pick up?

09:12.559 --> 09:14.143
The press is all over my hotel.

09:14.144 --> 09:15.728
I'm going crazy.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.502
I hate not talking.

09:17.809 --> 09:18.753
I miss you.

09:19.794 --> 09:22.797
Please, call me.

10:10.550 --> 10:12.801
Did you kill Molly?

10:12.802 --> 10:14.762
Answer me!

10:17.848 --> 10:19.746
- Did you kill my sister?
- No.

10:19.747 --> 10:20.622
I saw the papers.

10:21.337 --> 10:23.083
You're obsessed with that professor.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.209
You didn't want Molly
to steal him away from you.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.879
So you went after her
like you went after his wife.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.630
No! I dumped Professor Linley

10:29.631 --> 10:30.965
months ago when I found out
he was married.

10:30.966 --> 10:32.133
Don't lie to me.

10:32.134 --> 10:33.245
I loved Molly.

10:36.328 --> 10:37.806
I'd never hurt her.

10:44.772 --> 10:46.163
Did you follow me here?

10:53.204 --> 10:55.331
Molly had this in her room back home.

10:57.104 --> 10:58.492
Is this all her stuff?

10:59.495 --> 11:00.829
Uh, yeah.

11:01.186 --> 11:03.290
She used to live in this building,

11:03.290 --> 11:04.832
before we all moved in together.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.074
Why are you here?

11:08.321 --> 11:11.324
I... wanted some of, uh,

11:11.349 --> 11:13.393
Molly's pictures
from when she was growing up,

11:13.418 --> 11:15.545
for her memorial today.

11:15.886 --> 11:17.322
What have you got there?

11:18.089 --> 11:20.599
It's just an old necklace
of hers I found.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.846
I don't remember
Molly ever wearing this.

11:35.749 --> 11:37.709
I can't believe I let a year go by

11:37.734 --> 11:39.036
without seeing my sister.

11:41.653 --> 11:43.654
She talked about you all the time.

11:43.655 --> 11:44.744
She did?

11:45.407 --> 11:46.657
Yeah.

11:46.658 --> 11:48.325
She told me, when she was little,

11:48.326 --> 11:49.912
she wanted to take ballet lessons.

11:50.412 --> 11:52.413
But your mom said
they were too expensive.

11:52.414 --> 11:55.233
One day, you walked her to class
and they were already paid for.

11:56.334 --> 11:58.170
She never knew how you got the money.

11:58.170 --> 11:59.347
She was really good.

11:59.348 --> 12:00.504
She deserved them.

12:02.424 --> 12:03.882
She also said

12:03.883 --> 12:05.723
that she never had
a single date in high school,

12:05.748 --> 12:07.218
'cause you scared all the boys away.

12:07.219 --> 12:08.053
They were all eejits.

12:12.669 --> 12:15.192
Do you know how I found out
Molly was pregnant?

12:15.630 --> 12:17.589
In the bloody papers.

12:17.590 --> 12:20.467
Do you think that professor
knocked her up?

12:20.468 --> 12:23.220
I don't even know for sure
if she hooked up with him.

12:23.221 --> 12:25.139
One day, I saw him creeping on her,

12:25.140 --> 12:28.934
and I warned her to stay away
from him, but... you know Molly.

12:28.935 --> 12:31.562
She did what she wanted to do.

12:31.563 --> 12:33.940
Do you know where that bastard is?

12:37.110 --> 12:38.559
Are you gonna go after him?

12:39.946 --> 12:42.573
I wasn't there for Molly
when she needed me.

12:42.574 --> 12:45.701
But when I get my hands
on whoever killed her,

12:45.702 --> 12:49.031
I promise you, before they die,
they're going to suffer.

13:11.674 --> 13:13.633
Um, where's your sister?

13:13.658 --> 13:15.617
You left her alone?

13:15.881 --> 13:17.281
Let me spell it out for you.

13:17.282 --> 13:19.301
Leaving Grace to her own devices,

13:19.302 --> 13:22.387
she grabs a shovel and
starts digging her own grave.

13:22.388 --> 13:24.306
You and that hat can quit
worrying about Grace.

13:24.307 --> 13:25.974
Finding her a new lawyer.

13:25.975 --> 13:28.226
Someone who's not on James's payroll.

13:28.227 --> 13:30.228
Wow, you really do
have a bug up your butt

13:30.229 --> 13:31.563
about your stepdad, huh?

13:31.564 --> 13:32.757
Pretty sure you know why.

13:33.272 --> 13:35.275
James had something
going on with Molly Ryan,

13:35.276 --> 13:36.142
didn't he?

13:36.143 --> 13:38.028
His stepdaughter's friend?

13:38.029 --> 13:39.279
Geez, that would be bad.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.156
See, you didn't answer the question.

13:41.157 --> 13:43.491
Right. You can't answer the question.

13:43.492 --> 13:45.535
Attorney/client privilege.

13:45.536 --> 13:47.329
I know you're ethically challenged,

13:47.330 --> 13:48.955
so let me spell it out for you.

13:48.956 --> 13:51.124
The fact that you're
representing James and Grace

13:51.125 --> 13:53.126
at the same time is a big old
conflict of interest.

13:53.127 --> 13:55.412
It's only a conflict of interest
if I am not smart enough

13:55.413 --> 13:57.652
to keep both James and Grace
out of jail.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.263
Fortunately, for all of us...

13:59.288 --> 14:00.830
You know who else is smart?

14:01.113 --> 14:02.014
Andrew Grantham.

14:02.429 --> 14:04.372
I've got a call into his office
to take Grace's case.

14:04.397 --> 14:06.372
I love Andrew Grantham.

14:06.397 --> 14:08.064
Yeah, I just sponsored him
at the McCallister Club.

14:08.089 --> 14:09.462
Skipped a ten-year wait list.

14:09.626 --> 14:11.502
No way he's gonna be
poaching a client of mine.

14:11.527 --> 14:12.527
Sorry. Try again.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.053
Michael Converse.

14:14.482 --> 14:16.107
My mentor from law school
says that he...

14:16.108 --> 14:17.938
He's preparing to defend
a serial killer.

14:17.939 --> 14:18.967
Lucky bastard.

14:19.332 --> 14:21.000
Yeah, he's not available.

14:21.001 --> 14:23.627
- You could do this all day long.
- Uh-huh.

14:23.628 --> 14:25.838
Yeah, and I'm sure
you could find someone else

14:25.839 --> 14:27.840
to represent your sister.

14:27.841 --> 14:30.759
And they might even be less
ethically challenged than me.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.303
But you know what?

14:32.304 --> 14:34.346
They're all losers,
every single one of them.

14:34.347 --> 14:38.100
Every single one has seen
a client of theirs go to prison.

14:38.101 --> 14:39.050
But not me.

14:39.644 --> 14:41.520
And I don't care who's paying for it.

14:41.521 --> 14:44.356
I'm not about to let
Grace wind up in jail,

14:44.357 --> 14:45.858
because I am not a loser.

14:45.859 --> 14:48.360
Now, can we please just move past

14:48.361 --> 14:50.404
this "I'm a bad guy" thing

14:50.405 --> 14:52.615
and get on with defending your sister?

14:55.452 --> 14:57.411
Maybe if you'd gone with that one.

14:57.412 --> 15:00.415
Fedoras are for pimps.

15:11.541 --> 15:14.126
Molly Ryan was my student, nothing more.

15:14.127 --> 15:16.378
Oh, please. Really?

15:16.379 --> 15:18.046
Look, I didn't have to come down here.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.382
I-I could have hidden behind my lawyer.

15:20.383 --> 15:22.634
But I'm innocent,
and I want you to focus

15:22.635 --> 15:24.094
on finding whoever killed
that poor girl.

15:24.095 --> 15:27.222
Or... you're a highly educated man

15:27.223 --> 15:29.975
who thought it would be a cinch
to put one over

15:29.976 --> 15:31.945
on the lunks down at the station.

15:33.020 --> 15:34.646
I'm not here to play games.

15:34.647 --> 15:37.216
So ask your questions,
and let's get on with it.

15:38.025 --> 15:39.574
All right.

15:39.575 --> 15:40.374
All right.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.258
What about Grace Atwood?

15:43.259 --> 15:45.206
Was she nothing but a student, too?

15:45.259 --> 15:46.759
That was a big mistake.

15:46.760 --> 15:48.344
But it's been over for months.

15:48.345 --> 15:49.554
Huh.

15:49.555 --> 15:52.682
Was Carina Grabill a mistake?

15:52.683 --> 15:56.519
Evelyn Winters.
Veronica Ancell. Sara Kayla.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.604
Whew! This is a lot of girls.

15:58.605 --> 16:00.439
Was it like, new semester, new victim?

16:00.440 --> 16:03.609
Those women
were just as willing as I was.

16:03.610 --> 16:05.528
Was Molly willing?

16:05.529 --> 16:07.238
I didn't sleep with Molly.

16:07.239 --> 16:09.824
Why not? Why not?

16:09.825 --> 16:12.410
She was just as pretty as these girls.

16:12.411 --> 16:13.383
Just as beautiful.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.663
Just as young, just as
vulnerable to your charms, or...

16:19.959 --> 16:22.412
Maybe she didn't think
you were so charming.

16:22.413 --> 16:25.547
Maybe she thought you were just
a pathetic old pervert.

16:25.548 --> 16:27.632
Did she laugh in your face, Professor?

16:27.633 --> 16:29.801
Is that what happened? Is that
why you didn't sleep with her?

16:29.802 --> 16:31.136
Is that why she's dead now?

16:31.137 --> 16:33.972
I asked her to a coffee once.

16:33.973 --> 16:36.516
She said no, and that was the end of it.

16:36.517 --> 16:38.143
I-I didn't kill Molly.

16:38.144 --> 16:40.938
I never laid a hand on her. I swear.

16:48.445 --> 16:51.671
In that case,
you wouldn't mind giving us

16:51.672 --> 16:53.208
your fingerprints and a DNA swab

16:53.209 --> 16:56.027
so we can clear this up
for good, will you?

17:12.890 --> 17:14.848
Well? What did you get?

17:14.849 --> 17:17.685
Linley's wife never dropped his alibi,

17:17.686 --> 17:20.396
even when I dropped the sweet
young things in her lap.

17:20.397 --> 17:21.856
Yeah, Linley didn't crack, either,

17:21.857 --> 17:25.777
but I did get prints and DNA,
so you never know.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.695
We might get lucky. Did you get
any hits off the phone?

17:27.696 --> 17:30.033
Not a single text to Molly
or any of his other birds.

17:30.034 --> 17:32.806
Which means he's got a burner somewhere.

17:32.807 --> 17:35.203
Yeah, which is probably at
the bottom of the Thames by now.

17:38.273 --> 17:39.807
Along with Molly's phone.

18:05.276 --> 18:07.945
Molly always loved that one.

18:09.766 --> 18:11.685
Making a playlist for...

18:13.544 --> 18:15.546
... for her memorial.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.500
How have you been?

18:24.014 --> 18:25.042
If you need a place to crash,

18:25.043 --> 18:26.807
my sister and I have a hotel suite.

18:26.808 --> 18:29.101
- There's plenty of room.
- I'm covered.

18:29.102 --> 18:31.979
But the press on this case is nuts.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.664
You must be going mental.

18:34.665 --> 18:36.415
You have no idea.

18:36.983 --> 18:41.361
And my lawyer says the press
is gonna find everything.

18:41.362 --> 18:44.656
Hey, does Finch record things
at The Courtenay?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.408
You don't need to worry
about The Courtenay.

18:47.148 --> 18:49.119
Besides, you only went once.

18:49.120 --> 18:50.371
It's not a big deal.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.372
My sister would freak.

18:52.373 --> 18:54.916
So would Molly's family.

18:54.917 --> 18:57.335
I went to her old storage unit
today to find her necklace,

18:57.336 --> 19:00.297
but her brother showed up
and he took it from me.

19:00.298 --> 19:01.840
Better he have it than the coppers.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.585
Maybe I should let the police
find it though.

19:03.586 --> 19:04.588
I mean...

19:05.344 --> 19:08.513
maybe the killer
was one of Molly's clients.

19:08.514 --> 19:09.815
What are you saying?

19:09.966 --> 19:12.884
What if some sick wacko
got obsessed with her?

19:13.363 --> 19:15.479
There was some pretty
freaky people at that place.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.306
Molly's dead because I brought
her there. It's my fault.

19:18.307 --> 19:20.199
No. Roz...

19:20.200 --> 19:21.768
Molly quit over a month ago.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.958
None of the clients know
anything about our girls.

19:25.369 --> 19:27.215
You want to know who I think killed her?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.819
One of the tossers
you invited back to our flat.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.363
You've never had to face
the consequences

19:33.364 --> 19:35.323
of the selfish crap you pull.

19:35.324 --> 19:37.075
But stepdaddy can't write
a check this time.

19:37.664 --> 19:39.995
He can't change the fact
that you invited

19:39.996 --> 19:42.831
a bunch of strangers into our flat.

19:42.832 --> 19:45.000
Then you went upstairs
to shag your boyfriend

19:45.001 --> 19:47.002
and left Molly down there all alone.

19:47.003 --> 19:48.462
And now she's dead.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.802
You really are a bitch, aren't you?

20:09.000 --> 20:12.169
No one beyond this point, please.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.512
James.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.089
Hey.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.050
Oh, kiddo.

20:18.571 --> 20:19.634
Are you okay?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.762
I'm so glad you're here.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.371
Natalie.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.308
You look well.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.459
Hi, James.

20:28.102 --> 20:30.229
Grace. Where have you been?

20:30.230 --> 20:32.231
I had some stuff to take care of
for the memorial.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.107
You can't just go running around.

20:34.108 --> 20:37.069
Girls, you've both been through
a lot these past few days.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.530
I wish we were together
under different circumstances,

20:39.531 --> 20:43.158
but, hey, we are... together.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.953
So why don't we go
have a nice lunch, huh?

20:47.680 --> 20:50.211
Mm, this is awesome.

20:50.212 --> 20:51.750
You're the best.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.961
Have you been doing
a lot of shopping this week?

20:53.962 --> 20:55.671
While Grace's life was falling apart?

20:55.672 --> 20:57.939
My firm had a deal going down.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.883
If I'd bailed, well, put it this way,

20:59.884 --> 21:02.553
you girls would not be
staying in such a nice place.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.222
And, thankfully, I knew
that Grace had your support.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.471
- Here you go, Mr. Lahue.
- Oh.

21:07.953 --> 21:09.017
Thank you.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.352
Did you enjoy La Bohème last weekend?

21:10.353 --> 21:12.187
The woman next to me was coughing

21:12.188 --> 21:14.731
through the whole thing, but
otherwise, yeah, it was great.

21:15.858 --> 21:16.859
- Thanks.
- Great.

21:19.429 --> 21:20.987
You were here last weekend?

21:21.496 --> 21:23.466
Actually, it was a few weeks ago.

21:23.467 --> 21:24.950
But you didn't correct him.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.285
You want me to correct a waiter

21:26.286 --> 21:28.171
who's just trying to be pleasant?

21:30.211 --> 21:30.914
No.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.892
- No.
- You're right.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.752
So, did you two get together

21:35.753 --> 21:37.331
when you were here a few weeks ago?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.852
Go out for dinner?

21:41.050 --> 21:42.467
I'm sorry, honey.

21:42.468 --> 21:45.679
I flew in for a meeting
and left the next morning.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.181
I just figured that for once

21:48.182 --> 21:50.726
I wouldn't ask you
to entertain the old geezer.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.769
It's fine.

21:52.770 --> 21:53.740
You didn't have time to see Grace,

21:53.741 --> 21:55.086
but you went to the theater?

21:56.987 --> 21:58.493
Wow.

21:58.610 --> 22:01.194
She's ruthless on cross-examination.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.424
I went with a client. What can I say?

22:05.260 --> 22:07.618
Knock yourselves out.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.500
Why can't you just be nice to him?

22:15.501 --> 22:17.070
Because I don't trust him.

22:17.095 --> 22:18.451
Did you see how shifty he was

22:18.476 --> 22:19.921
about being in London last weekend?

22:19.922 --> 22:21.118
You know what I see?

22:21.119 --> 22:22.662
I see that James is still good to me,

22:22.663 --> 22:24.301
even though Mom's gone.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.007
He paid for me to be over here,

22:26.008 --> 22:27.551
he's paying for this hotel,
for my lawyer.

22:27.552 --> 22:29.726
Grace, listen to me.

22:30.117 --> 22:32.762
You remember that scarf
you thought was Molly's?

22:33.329 --> 22:34.913
I gave that to James last Christmas.

22:34.914 --> 22:36.164
Why would Molly have it?

22:36.165 --> 22:38.166
James was at our flat a few times.

22:38.167 --> 22:40.391
Maybe he left it and Molly
started using it. I don't know.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.978
I get you don't want to admit
James is a bad guy,

22:43.003 --> 22:44.923
but deep down you have your doubts.

22:44.924 --> 22:46.251
I know you do.

22:46.525 --> 22:48.593
You wouldn't have freaked out
on Molly in that video

22:48.594 --> 22:50.220
if you didn't think
James was skeevy enough to try

22:50.221 --> 22:51.433
- to sleep with your friend.
- That's not true.

22:51.434 --> 22:53.158
You know he cheated on mom all the time.

22:53.159 --> 22:55.183
- I think that waiter had it right.
- Seriously?

22:55.184 --> 22:56.768
I think James was
in London last weekend,

22:56.769 --> 22:58.937
- not Amsterdam.
- So you're saying James killed Molly?

22:58.938 --> 23:00.730
James had more to do with
Molly than he wants to admit.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.249
- I mean, come on, he was...
- Oh, my God, Natalie!

23:02.274 --> 23:03.321
Stop trying to make me hate James.

23:03.322 --> 23:05.443
I can't believe
you'd try to take another...

23:12.950 --> 23:14.922
Take another what, Grace?

23:15.913 --> 23:16.880
Say it.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.896
I took dad from you, right?

23:20.418 --> 23:21.627
It's my fault he's dead?

23:21.628 --> 23:23.085
I didn't say that.

23:24.005 --> 23:25.255
Wait, where are you going?

23:25.256 --> 23:27.007
Molly's memorial.

23:27.008 --> 23:28.216
Wait, I'm coming with you.

23:28.217 --> 23:30.219
I don't want you to come with me.

23:40.521 --> 23:41.938
Hey, Roz.

23:41.939 --> 23:44.191
I thought I might find you here.

23:44.192 --> 23:46.318
I've already spoken to Kaley.

23:46.319 --> 23:47.813
She won't do it again.

23:47.814 --> 23:49.946
You do have a way
with the girls, Rozzie.

23:50.772 --> 23:52.282
There's still the little matter

23:52.283 --> 23:54.344
of the 20, 000 quid Kaley cost me.

23:55.036 --> 23:56.368
Your girl.

23:57.121 --> 23:58.040
Your problem.

23:59.825 --> 24:01.074
I'll get it.

24:02.003 --> 24:03.218
I know you will.

24:04.253 --> 24:05.921
Because you know what happens

24:05.922 --> 24:08.048
to girls who don't keep
their promises to me.

24:08.704 --> 24:10.193
Don't you, luv?

24:31.531 --> 24:32.770
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.821
- Worm Catcher?
- Sure.

24:38.195 --> 24:40.195
_

24:47.088 --> 24:49.355
Is that beer as piss warm
as the rest of them here?

24:49.356 --> 24:51.839
You know, it's not too bad.

24:52.510 --> 24:54.017
You're American?

24:54.018 --> 24:55.543
Yeah, New York.

24:55.568 --> 24:57.287
I'm from Jersey.

24:57.652 --> 25:00.529
Joe, an ice cold one of these
for my fellow Yank.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.656
- On me.
- Thank you.

25:02.657 --> 25:05.089
You're restoring my faith in humanity.

25:05.619 --> 25:08.287
I just spent three hours
at the American Embassy

25:08.288 --> 25:11.329
dealing with this horrible woman
who apparently hates people.

25:12.040 --> 25:13.540
Or maybe just me.

25:13.835 --> 25:15.878
Does she have a mustache?

25:15.879 --> 25:17.220
Yes.

25:17.439 --> 25:19.314
- How did you know?
- I work at the embassy.

25:20.117 --> 25:21.425
No way.

25:21.736 --> 25:23.303
Why were you there?

25:24.346 --> 25:25.360
Okay.

25:27.474 --> 25:30.476
My boyfriend works in London,
and I gave up my whole life

25:30.477 --> 25:32.687
to move here and be with him, but...

25:34.209 --> 25:36.335
I think he's shacking up
with his yoga instructor.

25:36.360 --> 25:40.696
Last weekend, he said he was
in Amsterdam, but I could swear

25:40.721 --> 25:42.764
I heard Big Ben
chiming in the background.

25:42.789 --> 25:47.084
So I thought maybe if I checked
his passport record,

25:47.109 --> 25:49.926
I could see if he was
actually in London last weekend.

25:49.951 --> 25:51.689
It's so pathetic, I know.

25:52.113 --> 25:52.980
No.

25:54.593 --> 25:56.302
I can help you nail him.

25:56.303 --> 25:58.756
I have access to the passport records.

25:59.265 --> 26:00.515
Are you serious?

26:00.516 --> 26:01.808
Yeah.

26:01.809 --> 26:03.142
Oh, my God.

26:03.143 --> 26:05.145
You're amazing.

26:06.615 --> 26:08.042
His name is James Lahue.

26:08.599 --> 26:10.059
L-A-H-U-E.

26:54.936 --> 26:57.771
Grace, I've been looking for you.

26:57.772 --> 26:59.651
Yeah, is that why you've been
ghosting me for days?

26:59.652 --> 27:01.337
I'm so sorry. I-I...

27:01.338 --> 27:02.478
I just want to say...

27:02.503 --> 27:04.778
- So now you want to talk?
- Grace, please.

27:04.779 --> 27:06.572
Look, I was ashamed because

27:06.573 --> 27:08.574
I was such a jerk last time I saw you.

27:09.062 --> 27:12.828
I-It's just, you have all these
people who care about you,

27:12.829 --> 27:16.249
and the only person
I have in the world is you.

27:17.935 --> 27:19.978
You're not alone, baby.

27:20.253 --> 27:24.340
James, my sister... they don't
get what I'm going through.

27:24.341 --> 27:26.723
You're the only one who does.

27:47.221 --> 27:49.722
I know it's a small consolation,
but it must be nice

27:49.723 --> 27:52.226
to see how many people are
here to honor your sister.

27:52.227 --> 27:54.011
Have you seen that bastard Linley?

27:54.828 --> 27:56.480
He's not at his house.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.356
I was hoping he might be bold enough

27:58.357 --> 28:00.191
to show his face at Molly's memorial.

28:00.192 --> 28:01.884
You went to Linley's house?

28:03.153 --> 28:06.113
Patrick, I saw your criminal record.

28:06.114 --> 28:07.490
The last thing
your family needs right now

28:07.491 --> 28:08.991
is for you to be in any more trouble.

28:08.992 --> 28:11.323
My family needs answers. I need answers,

28:11.324 --> 28:12.384
and you're not giving them to me.

28:12.385 --> 28:13.621
Look, I can promise you,

28:13.622 --> 28:15.331
if Linley had anything to do with this,

28:15.332 --> 28:17.500
we'll get him, but you need to stay away

28:17.501 --> 28:19.098
from this investigation.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.212
Focus on Molly,

28:21.213 --> 28:23.464
and allow yourself to mourn for her.

28:24.443 --> 28:27.469
I'll mourn for Molly
when her killer's in the ground.

28:32.307 --> 28:33.681
Patrick?

28:34.309 --> 28:36.018
Hi. I'm Veena Patel.

28:36.019 --> 28:38.396
I'm a reporter for The Story.

28:38.397 --> 28:40.147
I hear you're frustrated
with Scotland Yard's progress

28:40.148 --> 28:41.190
in your sister's case.

28:42.776 --> 28:45.070
You're looking for
Professor Linley, aren't you?

28:46.229 --> 28:48.656
I have a source
close to the investigation

28:48.657 --> 28:50.826
who's told me where he's hiding out.

28:53.787 --> 28:55.603
I'll talk if you will.

29:05.590 --> 29:06.516
Stephanie.

29:07.294 --> 29:08.515
Thought so.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.280
That stunned look
kind of gave you away there.

29:11.763 --> 29:13.264
Don't worry, no one's gonna think

29:13.265 --> 29:14.614
you're a sneaky little blackmailer.

29:14.615 --> 29:16.189
- How did you find...?
- Find you?

29:16.190 --> 29:18.478
Grace said you'd be the skank
with the bad ombré.

29:20.272 --> 29:22.218
Sorry. It's her words, not mine.

29:22.949 --> 29:24.866
You want to sit down?

29:25.062 --> 29:31.068
I imagine it's not every day
someone hands you 15, 000 pounds.

29:33.577 --> 29:34.780
Do you have it?

29:42.401 --> 29:43.743
Oh, hello.

29:45.255 --> 29:47.215
Do you have the laptop?

29:50.882 --> 29:52.056
Excellent.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.446
All right, so here's the thing.

29:56.499 --> 29:58.791
I find it kind of hard
to believe that someone

29:58.792 --> 30:01.377
who would profit
from her friend's murder

30:01.378 --> 30:04.547
would actually keep her promise
about destroying the video,

30:04.548 --> 30:06.841
so I'm gonna make you
a little promise instead.

30:07.218 --> 30:09.594
You keep your trap shut, I won't tell

30:09.595 --> 30:12.264
your deeply religious parents
about your abortion.

30:12.598 --> 30:14.390
I'm sorry.

30:14.391 --> 30:15.977
I mean two abortions.

30:16.519 --> 30:19.355
Deal?

30:22.149 --> 30:24.567
Oh, and, uh, I'm gonna keep that.

30:24.568 --> 30:26.325
But here.

30:27.446 --> 30:29.740
Get yourself a new laptop.

30:30.783 --> 30:33.159
Or some condoms.

30:33.160 --> 30:34.346
Just saying.

30:39.324 --> 30:43.160
When I first moved here,
I was pretty homesick.

30:44.123 --> 30:46.045
And then I met Molly...

30:46.799 --> 30:48.706
and she was from
a different country, too.

30:49.051 --> 30:50.761
And she missed her family just as much.

30:52.596 --> 30:54.889
But that wasn't gonna stop her
from having fun.

30:55.599 --> 30:58.017
And she wanted me to have fun, too.

30:58.739 --> 31:00.811
She took me to her favorite clubs,

31:01.605 --> 31:03.882
on walks in this beautiful park.

31:05.442 --> 31:07.735
She introduced me to London takeout.

31:09.405 --> 31:10.814
And she told me that only

31:10.815 --> 31:12.885
an "eejit" calls it "takeout" over here.

31:12.922 --> 31:13.914
It's...

31:13.939 --> 31:15.483
It's "takeaway."

31:22.116 --> 31:23.408
And whenev...

31:24.225 --> 31:26.623
whenever I was down, um...

31:27.638 --> 31:29.781
she always knew how to make me laugh.

31:30.749 --> 31:34.426
Mainly because almost anything
could make her laugh.

31:37.051 --> 31:40.011
And when she got going,
you really couldn't stop her.

31:40.036 --> 31:42.955
It was seriously a problem.

31:49.257 --> 31:51.361
But that's the thing about Molly...

31:53.334 --> 31:55.443
is nothing really stopped her.

31:56.689 --> 31:58.691
Ever.

32:02.340 --> 32:04.304
Are you ready to go, Your Highness?

32:04.387 --> 32:07.389
I don't know
how I'm supposed to keep going

32:07.735 --> 32:09.737
now that she's stopped.

32:12.259 --> 32:13.677
I'm sorry, Molly.

32:15.832 --> 32:17.327
I love you.

32:25.561 --> 32:28.563
That girl can really work up
the tears, I'll give her that.

32:28.564 --> 32:30.107
Gwen, look at this.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.612
That's a pretty interesting
perspective, isn't it?

32:37.012 --> 32:39.154
Was that taken through Molly's window?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.576
And the angle, it's dead-on.

32:41.577 --> 32:43.828
This has got to have been taken
from the same floor

32:43.829 --> 32:45.705
of the building
directly across from them.

32:45.706 --> 32:47.331
This could be their stalker.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.779
Could be.

32:49.459 --> 32:51.627
But I'm telling you,
there is something off

32:51.628 --> 32:53.045
about Grace Atwood.

32:53.046 --> 32:54.672
I mean, you don't slash someone's tires

32:54.673 --> 32:56.841
unless you've got a wicked
temper and a violent streak.

32:56.842 --> 33:00.052
Slashing up tires is a far cry
from slashing up your friend.

33:00.053 --> 33:02.305
- I just don't buy it for her.
- Because she's a girl?

33:02.306 --> 33:04.890
Because she's young and pretty
and from a wealthy family?

33:04.891 --> 33:06.601
Maybe this is cutting it

33:06.602 --> 33:08.166
a little close to home for you, huh?

33:09.873 --> 33:10.855
What does that mean?

33:10.856 --> 33:12.478
This isn't Ashington.

33:14.874 --> 33:16.349
This has nothing to do with that.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.975
Chase down whatever leads
you want, but I'm telling you,

33:20.223 --> 33:22.270
you better not take your eye
off Grace Atwood.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.481
I didn't want to cry.

33:27.314 --> 33:28.998
It's okay.

33:28.999 --> 33:30.875
I bet Molly would have loved it.

33:30.876 --> 33:32.501
You think so?

33:32.502 --> 33:34.337
I bet she's looking down right now,

33:34.338 --> 33:36.672
relieved that you didn't
tell the whole world

33:36.673 --> 33:39.258
you guys met when you stopped
her from walking across campus

33:39.259 --> 33:40.900
with her skirt
tucked into her underwear.

34:02.891 --> 34:05.934
Just leave it.

34:15.601 --> 34:16.612
Oh, my God, Luc.

34:17.118 --> 34:18.821
What is it this time?

34:18.822 --> 34:21.367
They're calling me "American Psycho."

34:40.775 --> 34:42.346
What a surprise.

34:42.628 --> 34:43.971
You're a liar, James.

34:43.973 --> 34:45.431
You weren't in Amsterdam last weekend

34:45.433 --> 34:46.766
when Molly was killed.

34:47.263 --> 34:48.516
You were in London.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.436
Your passport was stamped at Heathrow

34:50.438 --> 34:53.315
two days before the murder
and wasn't stamped in Amsterdam

34:53.315 --> 34:54.815
- until a day later.
- So what?

34:54.817 --> 34:56.025
You're accusing me of murder now?

34:56.027 --> 34:58.195
You were texting with Molly.

34:58.545 --> 35:00.821
And I know it wasn't over
some BS birthday present.

35:01.088 --> 35:02.615
The only thing that's keeping me

35:02.617 --> 35:04.451
from going straight to the police

35:04.452 --> 35:07.204
is my fear that they'll see this
as one more reason Grace had

35:07.205 --> 35:08.830
for wanting Molly dead.

35:08.831 --> 35:10.574
But if you don't start talking
right now,

35:10.575 --> 35:12.097
so help me God, I will.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.591
You're right.

35:22.292 --> 35:23.887
I had an affair with Molly.

35:24.869 --> 35:26.264
It was brief.

35:26.587 --> 35:27.975
She was an adult.

35:27.976 --> 35:29.876
So I'm a dirtbag, but I'm no murderer.

35:30.556 --> 35:32.895
I didn't even see her that night.

35:32.897 --> 35:34.356
I was playing poker at Aspinall's.

35:34.357 --> 35:36.220
You check their security tapes.

35:37.610 --> 35:39.903
You must be up to something
really dirty.

35:40.379 --> 35:41.863
It's never that easy with you.

35:41.864 --> 35:43.115
Come on...

35:43.116 --> 35:45.076
You never admit when you're lying.

35:46.911 --> 35:48.912
Whenever Mom would catch you
in some story

35:48.913 --> 35:50.747
that didn't add up, you would just

35:50.748 --> 35:53.250
bob and weave until
she just got tired and gave up.

35:53.855 --> 35:56.294
I'm not gonna get tired, James.

35:56.296 --> 35:57.963
I'm gonna figure out what you're hiding.

35:58.260 --> 36:00.089
What do you want from me?

36:00.091 --> 36:01.926
I want you to stay away from Grace.

36:04.053 --> 36:06.836
If you do that, I'll quit digging.

36:08.363 --> 36:10.224
But if you go near her,

36:10.226 --> 36:13.103
or if any of your shady crap
blows back on her,

36:13.104 --> 36:14.580
I will make you pay.

36:16.494 --> 36:18.066
Enjoy your salmon.

36:32.884 --> 36:35.677
A memorial for murder victim Molly Ryan,

36:35.702 --> 36:37.620
a young Northern Irishwoman
studying in London...

36:37.645 --> 36:40.189
It's like Whac-A-Mole with this girl.

36:51.392 --> 36:53.208
Don't tell me you crapped the bed, too.

36:54.773 --> 36:56.482
We have a Natalie problem.

36:56.507 --> 36:58.758
Really? I find her so charming.

36:58.983 --> 37:01.143
She knows I was in London
the night that Molly died.

37:01.144 --> 37:03.111
She knows that we were texting.

37:03.112 --> 37:04.653
We need to contain this.

37:04.654 --> 37:07.157
We have to find Molly's phone
before someone else does.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.291
Don't worry. My guy's on it.

37:08.292 --> 37:10.619
Soon as someone turns on
that phone, we find it.

37:10.620 --> 37:12.162
Well, that's not good enough, Gutterie.

37:12.163 --> 37:15.166
I am paying you a fortune
to fix this. Now fix it.

38:09.481 --> 38:12.233
I think I've figured out which flat

38:12.234 --> 38:14.026
that photo was taken from.

38:14.027 --> 38:15.655
I can do one better.

38:16.279 --> 38:17.821
I got a hit off Linley's prints.

38:17.822 --> 38:19.823
- From the crime scene?
- No.

38:19.824 --> 38:21.158
Another dead girl.

38:21.159 --> 38:23.035
This one took a header off a building

38:23.036 --> 38:24.245
up in Oxford six years ago.

38:24.882 --> 38:26.913
Guess who her professor was.

38:27.784 --> 38:29.083
Went down as suicide.

38:29.084 --> 38:31.252
Linley's paw prints
were all over a rain slicker

38:31.253 --> 38:32.431
she was wearing when she fell.

38:32.432 --> 38:33.573
Or was pushed.

38:34.506 --> 38:36.253
Son of a bitch.

38:36.254 --> 38:37.675
All right, let's bring him in.

39:00.278 --> 39:02.219
This one is special, luv.

39:03.076 --> 39:04.715
You don't want to mess it up.

39:52.438 --> 39:53.766
Bea?

39:55.086 --> 39:56.557
Tea's ready.

40:36.086 --> 40:37.669
Who are you?

40:37.670 --> 40:38.663
Who am I?

40:39.464 --> 40:41.379
I'm Molly Ryan's brother.

40:42.092 --> 40:43.887
You got her pregnant, didn't you?

40:43.888 --> 40:45.594
No. No!

40:57.899 --> 41:00.109
You knocked her up?

41:02.556 --> 41:04.149
And then you killed her!

41:04.957 --> 41:06.333
Get away from my husband!

41:06.358 --> 41:08.025
Get away from him now!

41:22.919 --> 41:27.567
