00:22.272 --> 00:24.774
STARBUCK: Previously on
Battlestar Galactica.

00:26.068 --> 00:29.946
ADAMA: I think the nova does look
like the mandala inside of this Temple.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.825
Maybe it was a road sign
on the path to Earth.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.410
HELO: It was on the temple.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.036
Where'd you get the idea
to paint yours?

00:37.121 --> 00:41.165
It was just something I've been doodling
since I was a kid. I liked the pattern.

00:42.251 --> 00:44.043
APOLLO: Starbuck,
you're getting too low.

00:44.128 --> 00:45.336
Come on, Lee.
Get her out of there.

00:45.421 --> 00:47.296
You come back!
Just let me go.

00:47.381 --> 00:48.881
They're waiting for me.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.635
No!

00:54.471 --> 00:55.847
FRANKS: Gaius Baltar,

00:55.931 --> 00:57.598
after carefully
weighing the evidence,

00:57.683 --> 00:59.809
this tribunal finds
you not guilty.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.519
(ALL SHOUTING)

01:01.603 --> 01:04.230
Get him back! Get him out
of here! Get him out of here!

01:05.190 --> 01:07.400
Gaius, it's okay.
Come with me.

01:07.484 --> 01:08.568
Where are you taking me to?

01:08.652 --> 01:10.278
To your new life. Come on.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.698
ADAMA: We're going to
the lonian Nebula.

01:13.824 --> 01:16.325
ADAMA: Sitrep! GAETA: Sensors
show major power fluctuations.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.994
Checking on fleet.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.710
It's true. We're Cylons.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.378
And we have been
from the start.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.174
Dradis contact!

01:31.258 --> 01:33.551
Massive Cylon fleet
on intercept course.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.595
ADAMA: I want emergency
jump for the entire fleet.

01:35.679 --> 01:39.098
Sir, all fleet ships were
powered down during the outage.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.684
It will take at least 20 minutes
to spool up the FTL drives.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.603
We just don't
have 20 minutes.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.772
Action stations. Set condition
one throughout the ship.

01:45.856 --> 01:48.816
This is not a drill. All Viper pilots
report to your Vipers immediately.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.861
I have a bogey at my 10.
I'm gonna go check it out.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.281
What the frak?

02:01.997 --> 02:03.956
Hi, Lee.
Kara?

02:04.041 --> 02:05.833
I've been to Earth.

02:05.918 --> 02:09.212
I know where it is.
And I'm gonna take us there.

02:31.235 --> 02:34.904
No. No, no,
this is frakking crazy.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.073
I saw your ship blow up.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.407
Afraid not.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.537
Did you not hear me?
I've been to Earth.

02:42.621 --> 02:43.913
Earth.

02:44.331 --> 02:49.669
STARBUCK: Big blue oceans, fluffy white
clouds. You're gonna love it. I promise.

02:51.672 --> 02:53.589
Identify that
ship immediately.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.675
Sir, I'm checking for
colonial recognition codes.

02:55.759 --> 02:56.801
Get Lee online!

02:56.885 --> 02:58.010
I'm trying, sir.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.428
I'm picking up
her ship's signature.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.097
That's her voice all right.
Hold on, hold on.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.515
It is not real.
It is a trick.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.850
Duplicate verification.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.059
Checking.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.236
Hostiles inbound. 200 plus.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.529
CAG, take them out.

03:16.613 --> 03:21.367
All players, Galactica.
Threat B-R-3-5-0, carom 2-1-1.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.870
Raptors, lean back as
missile pickets. Weapons free.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.788
Don't lose me
this time, Apollo.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.457
Oh, not a chance.

03:34.798 --> 03:35.965
Splash one!

03:37.926 --> 03:40.344
Take that,
you frakking toasters.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.221
Admiral, it's a Cylon trick.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.274
The Vipers have stopped
the main Cylon thrust,

03:53.358 --> 03:54.734
but the reserves
have broken through, sir.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.653
I want everything that can
fly up there immediately.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.615
Saul. Saul!

04:03.160 --> 04:04.911
What the hell
is wrong with you?

04:04.995 --> 04:06.162
Nothing, Bill.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.248
Never felt better
in my life.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.854
ADAMA: Col. Tigh!

04:33.357 --> 04:35.232
I gave you an order.

04:35.317 --> 04:39.111
Everybody that's ever held a
stick, I want them up there now.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.863
Get them out!

04:40.948 --> 04:42.490
Put them up there!
Sir.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.326
Attention. This is the XO.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.620
Ready, let's go.
Get that bird in the tube.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.414
Get that solo bird in the tube.
Where the frak are these nuggets?

04:50.499 --> 04:53.292
Come on, Mama's not gonna
save you today! Let's go!

04:53.377 --> 04:54.877
You wanna fly or not?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.756
Come on, ready or not, let's go.

04:58.840 --> 04:59.840
Hey, hey, this is crazy.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.676
What if I get up there and
another switch flips in my head

05:01.802 --> 05:03.719
and turns me against my own? (WHISPERING)
What the frak is wrong with you?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.889
Shut the frak up. It's like the
Colonel said, okay? Just think of that.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.808
Be the man you want to be
till the day you die.

05:08.892 --> 05:11.602
A lot easier said than done, 'cause I
don't know what the frak I am right now.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.187
You're Samuel T. Anders.
That's all you gotta remember.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.272
Samuel T. Anders. Now
get the frak in your ship.

05:15.357 --> 05:16.983
Who else would he be?
Hey.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.275
Hey, rook.

05:18.402 --> 05:19.944
Stay cool out there, all right? Yeah.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.571
You'll lock in and do what
you've been trained to do.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.907
Guess it's just like suiting up
for a championship game, right?

05:24.992 --> 05:27.618
Yeah, that's right.
Good hunting.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.165
Well, if she didn't notice anything,
maybe the other Cylons won't either.

05:33.250 --> 05:36.210
Yeah, well, don't wait
to find out. Shoot first.

05:36.294 --> 05:39.255
Get the frak in there.
Go kill something.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.091
Let's go! Let's load
these birds!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.801
Anders, get the frak
in your Viper!

05:43.885 --> 05:44.969
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.477
Where are you taking me?
It's a place we found.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.813
An unused compartment.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.224
Sir, we've lost Pyxis!

06:32.309 --> 06:35.978
Oh, my Gods. Captain Tarney,
600 souls on that ship.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.357
How did they find us?

40, correction, 50 plus inbound.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.500
Half targeted on us,
half on the fleet.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.461
Have AAA target only missiles
going towards the fleet.

07:00.545 --> 07:02.755
We can handle the hits.
They can't. Yes, sir.

I am Samuel T. Anders.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.767
I was born on Picon. I went
to Noyse Elementary School.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.685
Get your thumb off
the transmit button, Sam.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.646
You're blocking the freq.

just turned back to their ships.

Base ships are spinning up.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.668
They're pulling out.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.546
We're gonna do the same damn thing
before they change their mind.

09:07.631 --> 09:10.299
Helo, have our fighters
cover our withdrawal.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.801
HELO: Yes, sir. All fighters
assume rear cover formation.

09:12.886 --> 09:17.473
They had us. Game over. Why
the hell did they let us go?

09:19.684 --> 09:21.810
Maybe something's changed.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.188
Like what?

President. No idea.

develop my gun camera footage ASAP.

I've got a hell of a set
of vacation pictures.

12:36.172 --> 12:41.343
I'll need my post-flight checklist. I want
to sign out so I can get in the showers.

I don't have one for you.

believe in miracles?

No.

too frakking mean to kill.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.345
I'm okay.

What the hell are you
doing in a jock smock?

for over two months.

14:06.679 --> 14:12.142
That's impossible. My ship's
clock reads six hours and change.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.853
Then your clock's
wrong, Kara.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.482

will have you.

15:19.961 --> 15:21.962

to do with my rather savage mood swings.

Relax, Gaius.

You think I've brought you this
far just to let it end here?

15:59.292 --> 16:02.669
I need some encouragement. A
ray of hope about the future.

Oh, yeah, yeah.
Oh, thank you, yeah.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.945
Not some hollow ritual.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.365
No, no.

It's as if the Gods are
right here beside you.

16:33.868 --> 16:34.910
Well, yeah.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.080
When I pray to the Gods,

16:38.164 --> 16:40.457
I feel empty.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.336
Do you? That's a shame, isn't it?

16:44.420 --> 16:46.296
Her gods are false.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.673
Tell her.

16:47.757 --> 16:51.009
Well, if you feel empty when you
pray to Zeus or Poseidon or Aphrodite,

16:51.094 --> 16:53.762
it's because it is empty. It's
a totally empty experience.

16:56.516 --> 17:01.144
They're not real. They've
been promulgated by

17:04.399 --> 17:10.987
a ruling elite, to stop
you from learning the truth.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.825
And what truth is that?

17:14.909 --> 17:16.118
That's a very good question.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.703
What is the...

17:17.787 --> 17:19.538
There's only one God.

17:19.622 --> 17:23.792
There is only one God. In a
nutshell, that's the truth.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.756
We're alone here, aren't we? The
others aren't coming back soon.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.801
And the door's locked.
All right, good.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.894
Can you feel God's presence?

17:42.979 --> 17:44.938
You know what?
I think I do.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.816
So do I.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.359
Do you? Do you, too?

17:49.444 --> 17:51.236
We both feel...

17:59.370 --> 18:01.496
So, what's Cottle's verdict?

18:02.165 --> 18:04.082
Everything checks out.

18:04.792 --> 18:10.672
So, I'm me, not a Cylon? That
is why you had me tested, right?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.090
Kara, nobody said
you were Cylon.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.551
But you were thinking it.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.845
We had to be sure, Kara.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.098
Fair enough.

18:20.183 --> 18:22.184
Let's go through it again.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.102
How many times
do you want to hear it?

18:24.187 --> 18:27.147
As many times as it takes to make sense.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.276
I followed a Heavy Raider into the
storm. Took some hits, passed out.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.612
When I came to, I was
orbiting this planet.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.449
Its yellow moon and star matches
the description in Pythia.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.493
I took these
pictures in orbit.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.205
The star patterns match what
we saw in the Tomb of Athena.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.791
How did you get here?

18:45.875 --> 18:48.084
I told you,
I don't know exactly.

18:48.169 --> 18:53.548
Well, that's just not good enough,
Captain. Tell us everything you remember.

18:57.220 --> 19:02.224
I remember taking the photos. Turning
my ship in a reciprocal heading.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.439
And then, I'm not sure.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.611
I must've blacked out again.

19:16.989 --> 19:21.701
I remember a giant
gas planet with rings.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.498
I remember
a flashing triple star.

19:27.291 --> 19:30.460
And a comet. And then I
was back with the fleet.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.173
And for you, all of this took six hours.

19:35.258 --> 19:37.968
I do not understand the time
discrepancy either, okay?

19:38.052 --> 19:42.514
All I know is I was there. I took
the pictures. I didn't imagine it.

19:46.853 --> 19:51.106
I had my crew clean it up. There's
not a ding or a scratch on it.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.025
It's the got same tail number
as the one she flew out on.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.944
But I've been fixing up
that old bird since day one,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.823
and this thing looks like it's
been rolled off the showroom floor.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.950
So it's not the same ship.

20:03.953 --> 20:08.206
Unless she found a hell of a body
shop out there, no, ma'am, it's not.

20:10.251 --> 20:16.590
Admiral, it's just not the outside, either.
This is the data from the NAV computer.

20:16.674 --> 20:19.050
There isn't any. It's blank.

20:19.135 --> 20:22.137
There's no record of
where this ship has been.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.513
Okay.

20:24.599 --> 20:25.891
Put her in the brig.

20:25.975 --> 20:26.975
APOLLO: What?

20:27.059 --> 20:30.645
So, some things don't add up, and
we're back to thinking she's a Cylon?

20:30.730 --> 20:31.938
What about Cottle's test?

20:32.023 --> 20:34.399
Cottle's test doesn't
prove anything.

20:34.483 --> 20:37.611
Even if her DNA's the same,
she could still be a Cylon.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.863
She could've been one
from the beginning.

20:39.947 --> 20:44.034
Baltar's Cylon detector was a
crock. It failed to I. D. Boomer.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.915
I know how you feel
about her, Bill,

20:49.999 --> 20:53.251
but that is exactly what the
Cylons could be counting on here.

20:53.336 --> 20:56.922
We're back where we started from.
There could be Cylons right here,

20:57.006 --> 20:59.424
and we wouldn't know it till
they put a bullet in our heads.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.177
ROSLIN: Or led us
into an ambush.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.888
That Cylon fleet had enough
firepower to blow us out of the sky,

21:04.972 --> 21:07.515
but instead they ran and jumped.

21:08.726 --> 21:12.729
And there's Kara Thrace suddenly
back from the dead having found Earth.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.940
If Kara Thrace can
lead us off our course...

21:15.024 --> 21:16.775
APOLLO: Course?
What course?

21:16.859 --> 21:19.986
The nebula was supposed to be another
clue on the way to Earth, but it...

21:20.071 --> 21:24.157
The nebula is only a road
sign along the way to Earth.

21:24.241 --> 21:27.619
And we need to continue
to follow its path.

21:27.703 --> 21:32.707
Well, what if Kara is the clue
that we were supposed to find?

21:34.001 --> 21:35.502
And what if
she's playing you?

21:35.586 --> 21:38.838
And what if she's playing
you? And all of us?

21:48.516 --> 21:52.560
JEANNE: Gaius, please,
can you help me?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.064
What's going on?
PAULLA: Okay.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.983
BALTAR: Oh, God...
Watch his head.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.025
It's Derrick.

21:59.110 --> 22:00.360
Derrick, is it?

22:04.407 --> 22:08.034
Derrick, I see.
Where are my clothes?

22:08.119 --> 22:09.869
It's okay.
Is it?

22:15.584 --> 22:16.918
Did they give you
a diagnosis?

22:17.003 --> 22:19.754
They said he's got
viral encephalitis.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.381
Viral?

22:21.465 --> 22:24.175
I don't know, it's some
inflammation of the brain.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.635
Can't the doctors
do something?

22:25.720 --> 22:27.012
Well, not if
it's viral, no.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.306
I'm afraid it's up to
Derrick's immune system.

22:32.268 --> 22:36.271
And he has to be strong. And
we have to be strong for him.

22:36.355 --> 22:40.150
(WHINING) I didn't want him
to die in that sickbay,

22:40.234 --> 22:44.738
(SNIFFLING) so I brought him
here. So he can be with us.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.489
All of us.

22:46.574 --> 22:47.866
Yeah, all of us.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.617
Give me your hand, please.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.123
I wish there was...

22:56.667 --> 22:59.044
You know I prayed for him, don't you?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.087
I know.
I prayed for him.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.466
I know. I guess...

23:04.550 --> 23:08.803
I guess that the one true God just
doesn't want him to live, right?

23:35.289 --> 23:39.417
Anybody still hearing
that frakking song?

23:39.502 --> 23:40.585
Nope.

23:42.922 --> 23:47.467
Maybe it stopped when we
figured out who... What we are.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.471
Could have been
some kind of trigger?

23:52.556 --> 23:54.516
To switch us on?

23:54.975 --> 23:58.394
You know, after that Raider
scanned me with that red light,

23:58.479 --> 24:00.271
damn thing just
cut and ran.

24:00.356 --> 24:01.356
TIGH: They all did.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.651
You think it recognized you as a Cylon?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.069
I don't know.

24:07.613 --> 24:12.242
Maybe that's why it didn't shoot me.
More important, why didn't I shoot him?

24:12.326 --> 24:15.537
Racetrack was right. You just
made a dumb nugget mistake.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.455
SAM: Did I?

24:17.540 --> 24:20.583
Maybe I was programmed
to leave my gun safeties on.

24:20.668 --> 24:25.672
Those bastards can't program
me to help them. No way.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.800
Boomer thought
the same thing.

24:30.886 --> 24:32.637
And then she
shot the old man.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.140
Boomer didn't know
what she was.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.977
We do. That is
not gonna happen.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.776
(GUN COCKING)

24:50.990 --> 24:52.490
Agreed?

25:07.798 --> 25:09.924
I don't know
why I'm here.

25:16.390 --> 25:17.932
Yes, I do.

25:21.145 --> 25:23.980
I'm here because of the
things that we've shared

25:24.064 --> 25:25.481
and the things
that we've seen.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.150
The visions in
the opera house.

25:27.234 --> 25:32.113
You went inside. You saw more than I did.
I thought that maybe you could help me.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.907
Help you how?

25:33.991 --> 25:38.745
I need to know about the other
five. The types we've never seen.

25:40.372 --> 25:44.709
The ones that Baltar
calls the Final Five.

25:44.793 --> 25:48.671
And you want to know if
Kara Thrace is one of them.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.131
Yes.

25:52.676 --> 25:55.678
I've been programmed
never to think about them.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.472
Well, your programming
isn't working,

25:57.556 --> 26:00.850
because you're thinking
about them right now.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.310
I try not to.

26:02.394 --> 26:06.606
Trying not to is thinking about
them. How do you rationalize that?

26:11.362 --> 26:13.821
All right, don't move.
Back off.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.199
Don't leave,
back off.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.245
The five are close.

26:21.872 --> 26:23.248
What?

26:23.332 --> 26:24.999
(WHISPERING)
I can feel them.

26:28.963 --> 26:31.256
STARBUCK:
What about this one?

26:31.340 --> 26:33.341
It's a proto-planetary system.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.093
So?

26:35.177 --> 26:36.594
Nothing but rocks.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.681
No ringed gas giants
like you claim you saw.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.683
I did see it, Lieutenant.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.767
If you say so, sir.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.352
And what are you
saying, Mr. Gaeta?

26:44.436 --> 26:47.605
I'm not saying anything, sir.
I'm just following orders.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.190
Well, I'm ordering
you to help me.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.275
You're ordering me?

26:50.359 --> 26:52.277
Mr. Gaeta,
take a break.

26:53.153 --> 26:54.737
With pleasure, sir.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.365
Jump clock is running, Dee.
Take us out of here.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.158
Yes, sir.

26:59.243 --> 27:01.202
What's going on?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.956
I see it on his face.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.959
On all of their faces.
No one believes me.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.425
You want people
to believe you?

27:15.509 --> 27:17.510
Find that star system.

27:17.594 --> 27:18.886
It's a big waste of time.

27:18.971 --> 27:23.683
Hey, we've only been at it a few
hours. Found maybe a dozen trinaries.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.310
Baltar's calculations
took months.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.061
It doesn't work like that.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.063
How does it work, Kara?

27:32.151 --> 27:33.693
It's a feeling.

27:34.903 --> 27:39.782
An intuition. I didn't use NAV
fixes to get there and back.

27:39.867 --> 27:42.910
When we were at that nebula,
it was so clear to me.

27:42.995 --> 27:46.164
But every jump we take farther
away, the clarity fades.

27:46.248 --> 27:51.044
If we keep jumping like this, I
won't be able to find our way back.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.338
That'll be all.

27:53.422 --> 27:56.424
All hands, prepare
for jump in ten...

27:56.508 --> 27:58.259
The President's adamant.
... nine, eight...

27:58.344 --> 28:01.679
We're gonna continue on the course
laid out by the Eye of Jupiter.

28:01.764 --> 28:07.101
...five, four,
three, two, jump.

28:11.148 --> 28:12.440
(GASPS)

28:12.858 --> 28:14.942
We're going
the wrong way.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.613
If we keep jumping like this, I'm
gonna lose the feeling completely,

28:18.697 --> 28:21.115
and never be able
to take us back.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.868
What do you want me to do?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.955
You want me to
go to Laura Roslin,

28:28.040 --> 28:30.083
tell her, "Forget Pythia
and the Eye of Jupiter

28:30.167 --> 28:33.461
"because Kara has some
feeling about where Earth is"?

28:33.545 --> 28:34.796
Yes.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.716
I can't.

28:40.135 --> 28:45.515
I just left your ship.
There's not a scratch on it.

28:45.599 --> 28:47.141
It's brand-new.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.147
How do you
explain that, Kara?

28:58.612 --> 29:01.614
Look at me.
Look at me.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.870
I swear to the Gods,

29:07.955 --> 29:13.042
it's me, Kara.
I can do this.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.797
You once said you loved
me like a daughter.

29:17.881 --> 29:21.175
If you still do, you've
gotta trust me on this one.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.223
I can't afford to.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.614
STARBUCK:
They're waiting for me.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.491
APOLLO: No! No!

29:45.576 --> 29:48.453
STARBUCK:
They're waiting for me.

29:48.537 --> 29:51.080
APOLLO: No! No!

29:51.165 --> 29:56.836
What should I believe? Should
I believe my heart or my eyes?

29:56.920 --> 29:59.130
STARBUCK:
They're waiting for me.

30:01.008 --> 30:03.342
Well, you know
where I stand.

30:06.430 --> 30:11.225
I wanna believe her.
But the President's right.

30:11.310 --> 30:13.936
It's exactly what the Cylons
would be counting on.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.688
So I guess you're
not changing course.

30:15.772 --> 30:19.066
For the time being, we
follow the President's lead.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.488
She still staying
in your quarters?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.324
Just till we find
a place to put her up

30:26.408 --> 30:29.785
to finish the rest
of her diloxin treatment.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.752
I want to thank you for
suiting up during the fight.

30:40.130 --> 30:42.256
We needed everyone up there.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.099
We still do.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.566
I took those off
for the wrong reasons.

31:00.651 --> 31:01.901
Then put them back on.

31:03.445 --> 31:06.447
Baltar's trial may
have been the trigger,

31:09.660 --> 31:12.954
but this is a feeling
I've been having for a while.

31:16.959 --> 31:21.128
It's time for a change.
I need to move on.

31:24.258 --> 31:29.345
I've had some feelers from the
government. There's a position opening up.

31:32.307 --> 31:35.685
And I think I can make
a valuable contribution there.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.438
Maybe even more
than in the cockpit.

31:49.783 --> 31:53.035
Dad, what if Zak had come
back to us in that Viper?

31:54.746 --> 31:57.748
If my brother had climbed
out of that cockpit?

32:00.210 --> 32:02.712
Would it matter
if he were a Cylon?

32:04.673 --> 32:06.549
If he always had been?

32:08.844 --> 32:10.845
When all's said and done,

32:12.431 --> 32:15.516
would that change how
we really feel about him?

33:09.988 --> 33:11.656
Please, God.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.578
I'm only asking you
this one last time.

33:20.082 --> 33:22.083
Don't let this child die.

33:26.338 --> 33:30.091
Has he sinned against you? He
can't have sinned against you.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.427
He's not even
had a life yet.

33:34.721 --> 33:40.434
How can you take him and let
me live? After all I've done.

33:41.937 --> 33:45.856
Really, if you want
someone to suffer, take me.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.444
We both know I deserve it.

33:53.115 --> 33:59.537
I have been selfish and weak.
I have failed so many people.

34:01.206 --> 34:03.666
And I have killed.

34:05.293 --> 34:08.087
I'm not asking
for your forgiveness.

34:10.799 --> 34:16.303
I'm just asking that you spare
the life of this innocent child.

34:18.807 --> 34:25.396
Don't take him. Take me.
Take me, take me, please.

34:28.442 --> 34:29.984
(DEEP SIGH)

34:40.287 --> 34:43.664
PAULLA: We were all very moved
by the way you prayed for Derrick.

34:43.749 --> 34:48.252
Fat lot of good it did him. Unfortunately,
he's worse, if you hadn't realized.

34:48.336 --> 34:50.755
Doesn't mean God
didn't hear you.

34:50.839 --> 34:53.215
I'm sure he's looking after
Derrick's immortal soul.

34:53.300 --> 34:57.136
Yes, I wish I shared your
confidence on that one. I really do.

34:57.387 --> 34:59.680
But you have
to keep the faith.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.974
We all look to you
for guidance...

35:02.058 --> 35:03.768
Well, you shouldn't,
should you?

35:03.852 --> 35:05.728
I mean, you're just...

35:08.523 --> 35:10.524
Well, you're very young.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.068
(SCOFFS)

35:15.363 --> 35:17.698
What are we doing
here exactly?

35:23.830 --> 35:25.247
(CHUCKLES)

35:36.009 --> 35:37.551
Thank you.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.306
(DOOR OPENING)

35:44.851 --> 35:46.769
Mr. President.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.897
Gaius, let's go.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.735
We should get back, okay?

35:54.820 --> 35:56.904
Good to see you again.

35:59.699 --> 36:01.575
I'm sorry. I can't...

36:01.660 --> 36:05.412
We met at the groundbreaking
ceremony on New Caprica.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.498
I introduced you
to my son Kevin.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.875
He told you he wanted to be
President when he grew up.

36:09.960 --> 36:14.088
You told him that he could be
if he stuck to his schoolwork.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.925
He's a redhead
little boy, isn't he?

36:18.009 --> 36:19.176
About eight
or nine years old?

36:19.261 --> 36:20.302
Seven.

36:20.387 --> 36:22.972
Seven years old.
Seven? He's seven.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.518
How is...

36:27.602 --> 36:28.686
Kevin.
Kevin. How is he?

36:28.770 --> 36:30.145
He's dead.

36:31.356 --> 36:32.523
Your police shot him.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.276
Come on, Gaius,
let's get out of here.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.319
(GASPING)

36:39.656 --> 36:40.698
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

36:40.782 --> 36:41.740
Leave her alone!

36:41.825 --> 36:43.033
Look at me!
Leave her alone!

36:43.118 --> 36:44.618
Look at me!

36:51.459 --> 36:52.793
(GRUNTING)

36:53.336 --> 36:58.299
Scream. Come on, scream! I want
to see if anyone comes to help you.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.009
(SCREAMING)

37:00.093 --> 37:01.302
Scream!

37:01.803 --> 37:03.304
(CHOKING)

37:03.847 --> 37:05.222
(CHUCKLES)

37:05.682 --> 37:06.849
Beg.

37:06.933 --> 37:10.060
I bet you begged the Cylons.
Why don't you beg for me?

37:10.145 --> 37:11.812
Come on, beg!

37:12.606 --> 37:15.941
Get up. Get on your knees. Get up.

37:16.026 --> 37:17.860
(CONTINUES CHOKING)

37:18.320 --> 37:19.653
(GRUNTS)

37:19.738 --> 37:22.865
You asked God to take your
life instead of the boy's.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.241
Did you mean it?

37:24.326 --> 37:25.409
Yes.

37:26.411 --> 37:30.748
Do it. Take my life.

37:30.832 --> 37:31.999
Please.

37:33.627 --> 37:35.044
(GROANS)

37:36.796 --> 37:38.088
Please.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.885
Please take my life.

37:46.431 --> 37:48.098
(GRUNTING)

37:52.854 --> 37:53.938
No.

38:00.445 --> 38:03.656
You see? Gaius, I knew
God wouldn't desert you.

38:03.740 --> 38:07.826
I felt his love course through me,
giving me the strength to smite them.

38:07.911 --> 38:11.205
A little less smiting next time, unless
you want to be held up on murder charges.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.126
JEANNE: Gaius!

38:16.211 --> 38:18.545
You two, watch the door.
(GASPING) Gaius.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.007
Are you all right?

38:22.092 --> 38:24.093
I cut myself shaving.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.386
Okay.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.263
Well, you have to come. You
have to come and see Derrick.

38:28.348 --> 38:30.307
Derrick? Derrick, oh, yes.

38:30.392 --> 38:31.392
God answered your prayers.

38:31.476 --> 38:32.685
You have to see.
What?

38:32.769 --> 38:34.061
(CHUCKLES) Look.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.773
Look at him.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.110
Hi.

38:49.202 --> 38:51.412
And no trace of a fever.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.251
(SNIFFLING) It's a miracle.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.325
No one took it down.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.621
Not the old man. Not Lee.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.915
Not even you, Sam.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.501
You just got back, Kara.

39:39.586 --> 39:41.086
We're all still trying
to get a handle on this.

39:41.171 --> 39:44.423
You know, you gotta
cut people some slack.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.425
Cut yourself some, too.

39:49.387 --> 39:54.808
When I woke up orbiting Earth, I just
figured it was some crazy dream, but...

39:57.729 --> 40:02.024
I went in following
a Heavy Raider.

40:04.986 --> 40:07.654
I mean, maybe the Cylons
pulled me out of the soup

40:07.739 --> 40:13.243
and captured me, brainwashed me on
Caprica, and they experimented on me.

40:13.328 --> 40:15.287
I mean, did they
take pieces of me?

40:15.371 --> 40:20.417
I mean, is it possible that they
grew me, another me, in a petri dish?

40:20.502 --> 40:22.836
Or they embedded me
with the memories

40:22.921 --> 40:27.007
or it with the memories,
or... I don't know.

40:28.093 --> 40:33.347
No, hey, no. Kara,
no. Listen to me.

40:34.099 --> 40:38.894
If you were a Cylon, then you've
been one from the beginning.

40:40.021 --> 40:44.233
Like Boomer. Spend my entire
life thinking I'm one thing...

40:44.317 --> 40:48.821
Yeah, and then you wake up one
day and discover you're another.

40:48.905 --> 40:52.116
Still doesn't change
who you really are.

40:52.200 --> 40:57.871
Still doesn't change the fact
that I love you, no matter what.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.458
You are a better person
than I am, Sam,

41:01.543 --> 41:05.295
because if I found out
that you were a Cylon,

41:05.380 --> 41:08.132
I would put a bullet
between your eyes.

41:08.216 --> 41:14.680
DUALLA ON PA: All hands, prepare
for jump in four, three, two, jump.

41:17.559 --> 41:20.894
(GASPING) Damn it, they're still
going in the wrong direction.

41:22.105 --> 41:24.231
One more jump and I'm gonna
lose my way altogether.

41:24.357 --> 41:28.443
All right, we gotta find you
a rack. Okay, take it easy.

41:28.528 --> 41:30.821
It's Roslin.

41:30.905 --> 41:34.408
The old man's not gonna listen
to me as along as she's...

41:34.492 --> 41:35.534
I gotta get to her.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.910
No, you can't do that.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.954
Is that a fact?
Yeah.

41:40.748 --> 41:42.249
No, no, wait!

41:46.588 --> 41:48.755
What the hell
are you doing, Kara?

41:48.840 --> 41:50.674
Where's the President, Sam?

41:51.718 --> 41:53.510
Kara, come on.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.133
(EXPLOSION)

42:50.860 --> 42:52.361
(GUN COCKING)

43:11.339 --> 43:12.839
