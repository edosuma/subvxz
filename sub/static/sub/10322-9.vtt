00:00.934 --> 00:04.305
My name is Earl.

00:04.372 --> 00:07.007
[ Earl Narrating ]
It was Christmastime.
A time of hope.

00:07.075 --> 00:11.379
And I was hopin' I had
enough bread to make
274 bologna sandwiches.

00:11.445 --> 00:14.348
They were for the list,
number 146--

00:14.415 --> 00:18.252
stole Gay Kenny's lunch
everyday in fifth
and sixth grade.

00:18.319 --> 00:22.022
Hey, one day I chewed up
Kenny's sandwich, spit it out,
and shoved it down his throat.

00:22.090 --> 00:25.459
You think I should count
that one? 'Cause technically,
he did eat it.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.229
[ Earl Narrating ]
The holidays were a time
of hope for Randy too.

00:28.296 --> 00:30.264
He was finally gonna make
his move on Catalina.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.400
I'm almost done
with my love poem.

00:32.466 --> 00:34.568
What's somethin' that rhymes
with "cartilage?"

00:34.635 --> 00:37.405
Or "Florida."
I can go either way.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.373
[ Earl Narrating ]
From the first day he saw her,

00:39.440 --> 00:41.775
Randy had a deep love
and respect for Catalina.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.777
Dibs.

00:43.844 --> 00:46.914
[ Earl Narrating ]
But he was too shy
to ever pursue it.

00:46.980 --> 00:51.219
Then he dated that tiny cat
lady who liked him so much,
she picked him over her cat.

00:51.285 --> 00:55.123
After that, he finally got
confident enough to show
his love to Catalina.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.758
Cat lady. Catalina.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.461
We had discussed that
coincidence many times.

01:00.528 --> 01:03.297
Are you sure you want
a love poem with the word
"cartilage" in it?

01:03.364 --> 01:05.999
Yeah. And the next word I use
can't be "heart-ilage,"

01:06.066 --> 01:08.636
'cause I already
used that.
"Heart-ilage?"

01:08.702 --> 01:12.005
[ Earl Narrating ]
And for Joy, the holidays
were also a time of hope.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.476
She was hopin' she could stay
out of jail for kidnappin'
and grand larceny.

01:15.543 --> 01:20.981
And her deaf lawyer was hopin'
Joy could control her anger
in a courtroom situation.

01:21.048 --> 01:23.117
Can you state your name?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.453
Yes.
It's Joy Farrah Turner.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.656
Libra.

01:28.722 --> 01:31.559
- And you're a resident
of Camden?
- Yes.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.596
Now, Miss Turner, you've been
a slut for how long now?

01:35.663 --> 01:38.632
You son of a bitch!
I'm gonna break every damn bone
in your talkin' hands!

01:38.699 --> 01:41.235
[ Screams ]
[ Earl Narrating ] And that's
why they were practicin'.

01:41.302 --> 01:43.837
Joy always did have a problem
controllin' her anger.

01:50.878 --> 01:54.315
This is what
I'm talking about.
You can't do this in court!

01:57.551 --> 02:01.555
I'm sorry.
It's just that deaf accent
of yours gets me every time.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.795
All right, I'm cool.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.731
Shoot me another question.
I can hold myself back.

02:13.201 --> 02:17.238
[ Whimpering ] Kind of like
the elementary school held
your dopey kids back last year?

02:17.305 --> 02:22.443
- My babies are off-limits!
- No, no, no, no, no!
Please don't!

02:22.510 --> 02:24.378
[ Earl Narrating ]
While I brought sandwiches
to Kenny,

02:24.445 --> 02:27.848
Randy continued planning
his big night with Catalina.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.651
The night I give her the poem
and tell her I love her,

02:30.718 --> 02:32.786
I'm gonna have the room
decorated with stuff
she likes.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.889
Do you know what she likes?
I don't know.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.226
A lot of girls
like rainbows.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.595
Rainbow.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.532
I'm gonna need a hose.

02:46.234 --> 02:50.238
Oh. Oh, hi, Earl, Randy.
What's new?

02:50.304 --> 02:53.374
[ Man ]
I can't take the crying anymore,
Kenny. You're a crybaby.

02:53.441 --> 02:56.610
And you're
an emotional terrorist,
that's what you are!

02:56.677 --> 03:00.514
Uh, I made you
274 sandwiches.

03:00.581 --> 03:04.117
I'm sorry, Kenny.
We tried, but
it's not gonna work.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.454
Then go!
Get out!

03:06.520 --> 03:08.656
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you!

03:09.890 --> 03:11.992
Uh, anyway, some of 'em
are on white bread...

03:12.059 --> 03:15.629
and some on whole wheat,
which I thought gay
people would enjoy.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.299
I hope these don't
have mayo on them.
I'm on a diet.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.802
Since I'm apparently
dating again.
[ Crying ]

03:21.869 --> 03:24.538
[ Earl Narrating ]
As much as I
didn't want to stay,

03:24.605 --> 03:26.574
Kenny needed someone
to talk to.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.609
[ Kenny ]
Ever since Brokeback Mountain,

03:28.676 --> 03:32.145
all guys want anymore are tough,
strong, manly types.

03:32.212 --> 03:35.516
- That movie totally
ruined gay life.
- Yeah, I hear ya.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.651
What's he talkin' about?

03:39.387 --> 03:43.691
What about people like me,
Earl? How am I gonna find
a man to love me?

03:43.757 --> 03:47.528
Look, I, uh-- I don't know much
about gay stuff, Kenny.

03:47.595 --> 03:51.699
The gayest thing I've ever done
is make all these sandwiches.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.269
Hey, you think you could
teach me how to be like you?

03:55.336 --> 04:00.274
Everything about you is manly--
your clothes, your scent,
even your name, Earl.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.176
Earl. Ear-r-r-rl!

04:03.243 --> 04:06.280
Please stop that.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.248
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

04:08.316 --> 04:12.820
You want me to teach you how
to be less gay so you can sleep
with more men?

04:12.886 --> 04:15.122
Okay.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.491
[ Laughs ]
Oh, thank you so much!

04:17.558 --> 04:20.093
Oh! Oh, this is gonna
be oodles of fun.

04:20.160 --> 04:23.364
Okay, rule number one.
Don't say "oodles" unless
it's followed by "noodles."

04:23.431 --> 04:25.499
That's right.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.038
[ Earl Narrating ]
While I was tryin'
to help Kenny,

04:31.104 --> 04:34.875
Joy's lawyer was tryin'
to help her by sendin' her
to an anger management class.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.610
Each of you has a disease.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.712
[ Earl Narrating ]
Unfortunately,
because of budget cuts,

04:38.779 --> 04:41.615
anyone with a control problem
in Camden met in the same group.

04:41.682 --> 04:43.817
It wasn't effective,
but it was cheaper.

04:43.884 --> 04:48.155
Whether it's
the disease of alcoholism
or out-of-control anger...

04:48.221 --> 04:52.993
or a sex addiction
or stealin' things
you don't need.

04:53.060 --> 04:58.399
But why? Why must
I steal pens and only pens?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.901
I have thousands of them!

05:00.968 --> 05:04.805
I don't want any more.
I am so ashamed!

05:04.872 --> 05:06.874
Oh, for God's sake,
would you suck it up?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.977
Nobody gives a damn about
your stupid pen problem.

05:10.043 --> 05:13.547
I'm sorry, but drinkin'
all the time, like Sheila
over there, is not a disease.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.817
What's on the back of her neck,
that's a damn disease.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.987
And wantin' sex
16 times a day just means
that whoever you're with...

05:20.053 --> 05:22.523
ain't gettin' the job
done right the first time.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.526
And please, havin'
300 pairs of fancy shoes...

05:25.593 --> 05:27.728
in your closet does
not mean Becky is sick.

05:27.795 --> 05:31.098
It means she's ugly,
and she just wants people
to stare at her feet.

05:31.164 --> 05:36.003
No, Joy, a disease is something
you have no control over.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.374
It's somethin' you can learn
to live with but cannot cure.

05:40.441 --> 05:44.778
A disease is somethin'
that is not your fault.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.248
I like that
"it's not my fault" part.
Keep goin'.

05:48.315 --> 05:53.621
Well, you have what is known
as Pathological Impulse
Control Disorder.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.090
Hot damn!
Does this mean I can get
crippled people parkin'?

Although it felt
a little strange,

05:59.292 --> 06:01.429
no one ever wanted to
be like me before.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.297
So helpin' Kenny
was kinda fun.

Untuck your shirt.
Really?

I do 20 lunges
every morning to make sure
I have a good butt.

Okay. Just seems
like a waste of lunges.

I took Kenny to the Crab Shack
to start his macho lessons.

06:18.846 --> 06:21.815

to wire some money home.

Big stack this week.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.121
Yeah. Club Chubby

policy during the holidays.

using this machine.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.266
It's too much
damn responsibility.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.269
Last month,
I accidentally sent $600
to the Taliban.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.404
Well, don't mess this up.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.306
If the money doesn't get
to my village each week,

06:46.373 --> 06:48.776
the men who kidnapped
my brother will cut off
his finger.

but as a magician,
he uses them all.

like that.

from around your beer bottle.

a stern taskmaster.

like "stern" and whatever
that other thing was.

about Catalina to help me with

When I saw that Rosie the bookie
was operatin' at the bar today,

to the manly world

on Tiny Dancer.

and so did me and Kenny.

and won that one too.

And four more after that.
Yeah, Tito!

08:24.437 --> 08:28.475
That's when I realized this
was the first time I'd really
gambled since I made the list.

08:28.542 --> 08:31.311
Maybe karma was lookin'
over my shoulder.

08:31.378 --> 08:34.882
That weekend, I took
my winnings and bought myself
a Christmas present--

08:34.948 --> 08:36.884
new tires for the El Camino.

08:36.950 --> 08:41.789
And since changin' tires was
a manly activity, I figured
I'd get Kenny to do it.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.024
I believe that's called
"multitasking."

08:44.091 --> 08:46.293
After Kenny changes your tires,
can we go to the store...

08:46.359 --> 08:49.362
so I can get
a special shirt to wear
when I ask Catalina out?

08:49.429 --> 08:53.233
I found out she likes dogs, so
if they have anything made out
of dog skin, that might be cool.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.669
Maybe later. I need
to get to the Crab Shack...

08:55.736 --> 08:58.005
and put a few bets down
while I'm still on a roll.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.207
I also need bubble wrap.
She likes the sound it makes...

09:00.273 --> 09:02.710
when it pops 'cause it reminds
her of her childhood.

09:02.776 --> 09:06.079

'cause of all the shootin'.

all out to be cleaned.

Why didn't you have someone
come here to clean it?

and somethin'
he called window treatments,

10:21.789 --> 10:23.857
Kenny thought he might
have a gamblin' problem.

And in Camden, there was only
one place for him to go.

10:27.227 --> 10:32.399
So in a sense,
gambling was a way to numb
your childhood pain.

10:32.465 --> 10:36.136
It did hurt when the kids
renamed that playground game
"Smear the Kenny."

on my list, Kenny.
I'm gonna get to it.

Hmm. Nope, I don't have

is not a problem.

has a basketball problem,
