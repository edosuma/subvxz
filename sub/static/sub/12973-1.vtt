00:53.971 --> 00:59.538
At that time,
everybody was tall, thin and blond.

00:59.668 --> 01:04.756
Everybody posed,
everybody gave you a look.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.365
But Gia was different.

01:07.391 --> 01:11.566
She was the first one who-
who moved.

01:11.714 --> 01:15.194
They all try to do it now-
give you an attitude-

01:15.237 --> 01:17.637
but she invented it.

01:17.638 --> 01:20.204
She always followed her instincts...

01:20.439 --> 01:23.352
no matter where they took her.

01:23.544 --> 01:28.353
It was probably the best
and the worst thing about her.

01:28.354 --> 01:31.790
With Gia, it was always
about the sex-

01:31.834 --> 01:34.877
every look, every move,
every minute.

01:35.313 --> 01:36.922
Every day.

01:39.479 --> 01:40.653
Sex.

01:40.740 --> 01:43.697
They were jealous of her.
They still are.

01:43.724 --> 01:45.767
That's why they say those things.

01:45.898 --> 01:50.030
She would come on to everybody,
but it was really innocent.

01:50.056 --> 01:54.013
I mean, nobody was ever
really offended by it.

01:54.057 --> 01:57.667
I don't think it had anything
to do with sex.

01:57.675 --> 02:01.024
Even when she was sleeping around,
sex was not the goal.

02:01.154 --> 02:03.016
Sex wasn't really an issue.

02:03.017 --> 02:06.583
Yeah, I knew about the drugs.

02:07.191 --> 02:11.279
I was afraid of the drugs,
the way people used them.

02:11.470 --> 02:13.253
It all just happened so fast.

02:13.297 --> 02:15.689
You know, all of a sudden,
her face was just everywhere.

02:15.776 --> 02:20.864
Every model has a moment-
I mean, the ones who make it at all.

02:20.951 --> 02:25.517
And being of the moment
is everything in fashion.

02:25.543 --> 02:30.893
Fashion is not art.
Fashion isn't even culture.

02:30.936 --> 02:33.154
Fashion is advertising...

02:33.198 --> 02:36.354
and advertising is money.

02:36.355 --> 02:41.488
And for every dollar you earn,
someone has to pay.

03:12.740 --> 03:16.654
Once upon a time,
once upon a time.

03:19.655 --> 03:22.047
It was a fairy tale.

03:23.221 --> 03:26.222
It was.
It was a fairy tale come true.

03:29.353 --> 03:32.050
I had two boys, you know,
but boys you lose.

03:32.136 --> 03:36.311
They go away, they marry other women.
They're gone.

03:36.338 --> 03:39.469
A girl you have forever.

03:39.496 --> 03:42.887
When Gia was born,
I said, "This one is mine.

03:43.027 --> 03:46.245
- Look at you.
- All mine."

03:46.332 --> 03:48.507
Look at me.

03:48.593 --> 03:51.333
Look at us.

03:51.464 --> 03:54.855
Look how pretty we are.

03:54.856 --> 03:58.770
Do I be-Do I be
the prettiest, prettiest girl?

03:58.857 --> 04:03.163
You do.
You do be the prettiest. You do.

04:08.042 --> 04:11.000
- Where the hell have you been?
- Out.

04:11.043 --> 04:15.305
- Out? Out? Out where?
- Out.

04:15.392 --> 04:16.740
Oh, Joe, don't start.

04:16.870 --> 04:19.870
Don't tell me, "Don't start."
Out where? Tell me where you've been.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.915
- Joe, lower your voice.
- Don't tell me to lower my voice.

04:21.959 --> 04:24.046
- The kids know you were out all night.
- Cut it out!

04:24.072 --> 04:26.856
- Tell them where you've been.
- I'm not in the mood for this tonight.

04:26.943 --> 04:29.639
Not in the mood, huh?

04:29.665 --> 04:31.883
- Just leave me alone.
- Who were you with Kathleen?

04:31.909 --> 04:34.824
- It's none of your business.
- Don't tell me that, you fucking whore.

04:34.867 --> 04:38.302
- Get out of the kitchen.
- Let me see. Did he fuck you?

04:38.346 --> 04:41.043
- Where? Let me feel!
- Pig! Get your hands off!

04:41.129 --> 04:43.304
- Who else has been in there besides me?
- Get your hands off of me, jerk.

04:43.391 --> 04:45.435
- Who else, huh?
- You know how you make me feel?

04:45.522 --> 04:48.871
- You make me wanna die. You know that?
- You wanna die? No!

04:48.958 --> 04:51.915
You don't die until I tell you
you can die. Do you hear me?

04:51.941 --> 04:53.898
That's when you die!

05:05.172 --> 05:09.173
Here, take this and put it in the car.
I'll keep this one.

05:22.741 --> 05:24.438
Once upon a time...

05:25.742 --> 05:28.048
in a kingdom far, far away...

05:28.134 --> 05:30.222
there lived a young girl...

05:30.483 --> 05:32.527
whose hair was made of gold.

05:32.623 --> 05:36.059
When the people
in the village saw her, they said...

05:36.310 --> 05:39.181
"Oh, how beautiful she is."

05:39.268 --> 05:42.660
One cheese steak, one meat ball,
one salami provolone.

05:42.747 --> 05:47.487
I'll be back by 4:00.
Try not to burn the place down.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.819
- Gia, you're in charge.
- All right, boss.

05:52.976 --> 05:56.064
Hey, get the food.
Go, come on, get outta here.

05:56.107 --> 05:58.847
- Get the cash register.
- I'm in charge!

06:00.883 --> 06:04.971
- Is your name Gia?
- Yeah.

06:07.381 --> 06:09.468
- Got a light?
- Stop screwing around.

06:09.599 --> 06:12.556
I've seen you a few times
around the neighborhood...

06:12.600 --> 06:14.643
- and-
- Are you nervous?

06:15.209 --> 06:17.426
Yeah.

06:17.557 --> 06:19.992
Am I making you nervous?

06:20.080 --> 06:21.385
Yeah.

06:24.602 --> 06:27.647
Well, good,
'cause that's the idea.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.778
- What's that?
- You scare the shit out of people...

06:31.909 --> 06:34.953
and then they don't see
how scared you are.

06:37.023 --> 06:38.545
Are you scared?

06:42.111 --> 06:44.938
What's your name?

06:45.026 --> 06:47.635
T.J. Tom Junior...

06:47.765 --> 06:49.722
but T.J. is what they call me.

06:54.245 --> 06:56.203
T.J. and Gia.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.717
I like that. Come on.

07:00.013 --> 07:03.014
- I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. Where you going?

07:03.100 --> 07:05.448
I'm in charge, and I'm leaving.

07:05.580 --> 07:06.622
Gia!

07:10.424 --> 07:12.512
- Is that the Byrds?
- They're so cool.

07:12.642 --> 07:15.382
Oh, wow.
Ooh, rock my world.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.514
Seventy-five cents?

07:19.992 --> 07:24.384
It's pretty. Pretty.
Very pretty.

07:24.472 --> 07:26.167
Hello, ladies.

07:26.255 --> 07:28.255
Can I have this?
Come on.

07:32.065 --> 07:35.632
- Tattoo? You getting a tattoo now?
- Tattoos. Tattoo you.

07:35.684 --> 07:37.840
No, tattoo you.

07:37.841 --> 07:41.494
- I'm not getting a tattoo.
- Oh, come on. What?

07:41.624 --> 07:43.625
Look at that hair.
It's fabulous.

07:50.192 --> 07:52.019
You want a tattoo now?

07:54.367 --> 07:56.671
She'd be a lot of fun.

08:01.073 --> 08:04.204
Who are you looking at,
him or me?

09:44.693 --> 09:46.912
Oh, I can't talk about the sex.

09:46.998 --> 09:50.695
I mean, how would I know?

09:50.782 --> 09:55.305
If you ask me,
she never really had sex with anybody.

09:57.602 --> 09:59.689
But she did love to be photographed...

09:59.733 --> 10:03.212
and people loved to take pictures of her
and do little things for her.

10:03.342 --> 10:06.299
She hated being photographed.

10:06.387 --> 10:11.083
You had to run after her
and tie her down.

10:11.171 --> 10:16.302
Then you had to get past the clothes
and the stuff in her hair.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.886
But she was special.

10:50.808 --> 10:53.505
Let's go.

10:53.531 --> 10:55.531
Coming, coming.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.828
All right, let's go.

11:15.554 --> 11:18.555
And they showed her
a beautiful house...

11:18.642 --> 11:21.556
on the planet Mars.

11:21.642 --> 11:25.209
And they said,
"Come and live here forever."

11:25.296 --> 11:27.862
And the young girl said...

11:27.948 --> 11:31.602
"Oh, Mars is a planet
where life's different-

11:31.689 --> 11:34.776
safe, clean and pretty."

11:36.342 --> 11:39.517
But-But how do you get there?

11:39.822 --> 11:43.736
Where do you find a taxi?
Which bus do you take?

11:43.997 --> 11:48.781
Right? And how do you know
you're there when you're there?

11:48.867 --> 11:52.521
Philadelphia was not ready for this.

11:54.217 --> 11:56.000
But New York was.

12:02.037 --> 12:03.603
It was the right moment...

12:03.689 --> 12:08.387
and being of the moment
is everything in fashion.

12:08.517 --> 12:12.562
But of course,
the more you were of the moment...

12:12.648 --> 12:15.171
the faster you become
of the past.

12:22.304 --> 12:24.303
Okay, let's get this over with.

12:24.304 --> 12:27.696
Just go in there
and try to be nice.

12:27.783 --> 12:30.654
- Nice? Nice.
- Yeah.

12:30.740 --> 12:34.046
Who knows?
Maybe they'll like you.

12:34.306 --> 12:38.221
- You are a very likable girl.
- Fuck you.

12:45.997 --> 12:47.519
Hi.

12:50.529 --> 12:52.573
I'm here to see Wilhelmina Cooper.

12:52.660 --> 12:57.400
So's the rest of the world and the rest
of the world's way ahead of you, honey.

12:57.487 --> 12:59.009
Take a seat.

13:00.357 --> 13:01.401
I have an appointment.

13:03.236 --> 13:04.541
Hold, please.

13:06.063 --> 13:07.369
Of course you do.

13:07.499 --> 13:11.108
11:00, Gia Marie Carangi.

13:11.195 --> 13:12.760
G what?

13:15.066 --> 13:16.893
Okay.

13:26.843 --> 13:30.626
There. Gia.
Just fuck the rest of it. Call me Gia.

13:30.758 --> 13:33.845
Do you think you can remember that,
honey?

13:33.932 --> 13:37.455
Yeah? Cool.
Now tell the bitch I'm here.

13:44.665 --> 13:48.405
I've already seen the pictures, darling.
Maurice sent them.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.537
I wanted to see the real thing.

13:50.623 --> 13:52.232
Well, this is it.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.147
It certainly is.

13:55.407 --> 13:58.669
You practically gave
my receptionist a coronary.

13:59.974 --> 14:02.148
Yeah, well, look.

14:02.279 --> 14:04.757
This was a free trip to New York...

14:04.845 --> 14:07.541
and if I knew you were looking
for Marcia-fucking-Brady...

14:07.628 --> 14:08.976
I would've stayed home.

14:09.106 --> 14:12.499
How do you know
what I'm looking for?

14:18.475 --> 14:22.693
- Look at me.
- I'm looking, I'm looking.

14:22.824 --> 14:26.260
You know, dressing like
a motorcycle tramp...

14:26.347 --> 14:30.565
is somewhat interesting
for a 17-year-old girl.

14:30.617 --> 14:33.053
Talking like one is not.

14:33.140 --> 14:37.880
In fact, talking at all is not really
required in this profession...

14:37.968 --> 14:40.360
or even encouraged.

14:40.402 --> 14:43.491
Anything you might have to say
you say through the camera...

14:43.534 --> 14:45.404
the image, huh...

14:45.491 --> 14:48.057
and hopefully the product.

14:48.109 --> 14:51.979
What comes out of your mouth
is totally irrelevant.

14:52.110 --> 14:53.371
Understood?

14:53.998 --> 14:55.259
Yes, sir.

14:56.434 --> 15:00.304
Now, this is a career.

15:00.435 --> 15:02.653
This is a future.

15:02.783 --> 15:04.784
This is a life...

15:06.263 --> 15:07.567
if you want it.

15:07.697 --> 15:09.785
Does that mean
you can get me a job?

15:13.812 --> 15:16.203
I get you the interviews.

15:16.204 --> 15:18.248
You get the job.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.851
And I believe you will.

15:26.937 --> 15:29.503
Dear Diary, this is my life.

15:29.764 --> 15:33.244
Go see Young & Rubicom, 9:45.

15:33.374 --> 15:36.505
Go see people at Revlon, 11:15.

15:36.636 --> 15:40.985
Go see Demi Moore, Bob Stone,
Somebody Malowinksi...

15:41.245 --> 15:45.116
and "Get lost, honey.
You ain't what we're lookin' for."

15:45.204 --> 15:49.291
- Next!
- Thank you and fuck you. Bye.

15:49.379 --> 15:53.945
Yeah, I go see, I go see.
Nobody sees me.

15:54.032 --> 15:57.903
"Ah, piece of meat, come here.
Show me your bag."

15:57.955 --> 16:00.173
And they stick their finger in you.

16:00.303 --> 16:02.565
"I just wanna taste your temperature."

16:02.965 --> 16:06.401
Go see, go see, go see,
go see somebody else.

16:06.619 --> 16:09.794
I ain't no good at this.
I ain't no good at this at all.

16:09.880 --> 16:14.708
But even if you are good at it,
what, exactly, are you good at?

16:16.838 --> 16:19.927
- You can't leave now.
- I have to go.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.101
What, what?
To Philadelphia?

16:23.319 --> 16:26.929
- For what?
- I got stuff.

16:27.015 --> 16:29.016
I have to go.

16:29.103 --> 16:34.235
Well, somebody has to take care of me.
I'm just a kid.

16:34.278 --> 16:36.322
Bullshit.

16:43.612 --> 16:46.656
What's in Philadelphia
that's more important than me?

16:49.091 --> 16:51.657
- Do not do that.
- Do not do what?

16:53.266 --> 16:56.572
Do not pretend you're gonna do something
when you know you're not.

16:56.658 --> 16:58.659
What am I not gonna do?

17:13.490 --> 17:14.794
What else?

17:33.626 --> 17:35.321
What?

17:47.925 --> 17:49.969
- Know what I want?
- What?

18:00.102 --> 18:01.450
What?

18:15.758 --> 18:17.846
How do they fit?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.981
This turn you on?

18:33.591 --> 18:35.242
Yeah.

18:35.374 --> 18:36.939
- Kinda.
- All right.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.766
Come here.

18:48.212 --> 18:52.038
- Have you ever had sex with a man?
- Yeah.

18:53.109 --> 18:54.414
Once.

18:55.197 --> 18:57.327
And?

18:57.414 --> 19:01.546
And I could've done that
with a German shepherd.

19:09.591 --> 19:12.809
Dear Book, this is
another day in the life.

19:12.853 --> 19:15.723
A life is like a book.
A book is like a box.

19:15.810 --> 19:19.289
A box has six sides,
inside and outside.

19:19.333 --> 19:23.334
So how do you get
to what's inside?

19:23.465 --> 19:25.726
How do you get
what's inside out?

19:25.744 --> 19:27.875
Once upon a time,
there was a very pretty girl...

19:27.962 --> 19:31.311
who lived in a beautiful box
and everybody loved her.

19:39.539 --> 19:42.192
- Yes, hello?
- Hello?

19:42.279 --> 19:45.323
- What?
- Who the hell is that?

19:45.453 --> 19:47.845
- Wili?
- Who is it?

19:47.889 --> 19:49.976
- Christ's sake.
- I couldn't sleep.

19:51.595 --> 19:54.422
- Middle of the night.
- It's very late.

19:54.552 --> 19:56.944
- I know.
- Goddamn it.

19:57.074 --> 19:58.597
Is that your husband?

19:58.683 --> 20:02.423
- Yes.
- Is he pissed?

20:02.607 --> 20:03.867
Yes.

20:03.998 --> 20:08.042
Is it true that he drinks?
That's what everybody says.

20:08.173 --> 20:12.261
And he gets violent?

20:12.348 --> 20:14.393
What is it you want, Gia?

20:14.435 --> 20:17.392
If he ever lays a hand on you,
I'll fuckin' kill him.

20:22.134 --> 20:23.568
Why can't you sleep?

20:25.734 --> 20:27.344
Do you want me to come over?

20:27.579 --> 20:30.187
You're nervous about tomorrow.

20:37.790 --> 20:39.225
Yeah, I am.

20:39.660 --> 20:42.269
Well, everyone is nervous
on their first shoot.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.879
You'll be fine.

20:44.966 --> 20:48.315
Yeah, I just don't know what to do.
You know?

20:48.402 --> 20:50.445
Did you do your colonic?

20:50.533 --> 20:52.533
Yeah.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.203
Good.

20:54.291 --> 20:59.292
Go to bed now.
Take one half...

20:59.422 --> 21:01.727
of the Nembutal-
the yellow and black.

21:04.258 --> 21:05.738
You'll be fine.

21:06.738 --> 21:11.869
- Just be yourself.
- Okay, yeah.

21:11.913 --> 21:13.956
What is that?

21:15.913 --> 21:18.871
Oh, darling...

21:18.958 --> 21:24.525
if I could answer that for you
or for me...

21:24.612 --> 21:30.700
well, life on this planet
would be a very different proposition.

21:39.721 --> 21:41.460
So I tell her, "Look...

21:41.590 --> 21:43.721
I know Calvin...

21:43.852 --> 21:45.895
and I asked him about you...

21:45.983 --> 21:47.679
and he didn't know who you were."

21:47.810 --> 21:50.158
- She's such a liar.
- Oh, man.

22:42.408 --> 22:45.191
Excuse me, can I help you?

22:45.278 --> 22:49.889
Yeah, yeah.
Could I have some more coffee, please?

22:49.975 --> 22:53.150
- Are you Gia?
- That's me.

22:53.237 --> 22:56.368
You're late.
Go wash your face.

22:56.498 --> 23:00.282
I already did.
It's nice to meet you too.

23:03.631 --> 23:06.110
What the hell
am I gonna do with you?

23:07.580 --> 23:09.189
I got it.

23:10.407 --> 23:14.452
I don't know.
I'm just some dumb girl from Philly.

23:15.843 --> 23:18.018
Oh, my God, she's a beast.

23:18.104 --> 23:20.757
She scares me.

23:20.888 --> 23:23.149
Oh, Phillipe, does she remind you
of your mother?

23:23.280 --> 23:25.324
No, she reminds me
of my brother.

23:25.411 --> 23:28.107
He's in jail now, thank Jesus.

23:30.056 --> 23:31.360
Okay.

23:41.955 --> 23:42.999
What?

23:45.251 --> 23:46.295
It's wonderful.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.644
Let's see this face.

23:54.220 --> 23:56.350
I'm checking to see
if you need to be tweezed.

23:56.481 --> 23:58.829
- I'm tweezed.
- I'm Linda.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.917
Nice to meet you.

24:03.309 --> 24:04.831
Dreadful.

24:06.962 --> 24:08.571
Absolutely horrendous.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.268
More teeth.

24:12.311 --> 24:17.016
Every photograph makes a promise,
and the promise is never kept.

24:17.017 --> 24:19.017
Look brain damaged.

24:19.105 --> 24:21.105
That's what makes a photo great.

24:22.497 --> 24:25.280
And if the promise is sex...

24:27.812 --> 24:31.335
- then you really have something.
- Good.

24:31.552 --> 24:33.074
Wonderful.

24:34.292 --> 24:35.727
Well...

24:36.422 --> 24:38.249
that was all shit.

24:38.337 --> 24:40.467
- Fuck you.
- Now we can pay our rent.

24:40.555 --> 24:43.077
Who wants to stay
and make some art?

24:43.381 --> 24:45.555
What's art?

24:45.643 --> 24:49.252
Keep the fence,
lose the clothes.

24:49.339 --> 24:51.339
No, thanks, I'm gone.

24:51.427 --> 24:54.123
I'm outta here.
See you.

25:00.325 --> 25:02.239
I'll stay if Linda stays.

25:37.187 --> 25:39.623
- Linda, liebling?
- Yeah.

25:42.494 --> 25:44.189
Go stand by the fence.

25:44.277 --> 25:48.103
- You want me in the shot?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:48.190 --> 25:50.191
And lose the clothes.

28:24.234 --> 28:27.844
Sex-Sex was really easy.
It was.

28:27.931 --> 28:33.366
Sex was everywhere.
It didn't really mean too much.

28:33.454 --> 28:37.150
Love was the hard thing to find.

28:39.575 --> 28:44.707
Even if you were looking for it,
which not too many people were.

28:47.305 --> 28:51.088
Even if you found it...

28:51.176 --> 28:53.176
which not too many people did...

28:53.263 --> 28:58.438
even if it was right there
in front of you...

29:01.280 --> 29:06.238
how could you see it
with all this sex in the way?

29:59.733 --> 30:03.908
Hey, where you going?

30:05.039 --> 30:07.997
What happened?
What's the matter?

30:08.083 --> 30:10.649
You don't have any clothes on.

30:12.425 --> 30:14.295
Don't change the subject.

30:15.338 --> 30:18.078
I have a boyfriend.

30:18.209 --> 30:19.687
So?

30:19.774 --> 30:22.688
So, I have to go.

30:24.037 --> 30:26.471
I have to go, I have to go.
Everybody has to go.

30:26.559 --> 30:29.690
Where the fuck does everybody go
when they have to go?

30:31.082 --> 30:34.386
You-You and I had a-

30:34.474 --> 30:37.562
I mean, it was-
I had a-

30:40.902 --> 30:44.468
I'm really very square.

30:45.600 --> 30:46.904
So am I.

30:46.991 --> 30:49.035
Yeah, I can see that.

30:52.167 --> 30:53.384
Please, don't go.

30:55.341 --> 30:59.385
Please, don't go.
Please, I'll make you breakfast.

31:01.256 --> 31:03.256
Come on.

31:07.328 --> 31:09.111
- Going down?
- No.

31:09.241 --> 31:11.198
- Yes.
- No!

31:11.285 --> 31:13.721
No, no.
What are you doing? No.

31:13.981 --> 31:16.722
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.
- Linda!

31:17.678 --> 31:19.156
I'll call you.

31:26.028 --> 31:30.246
It was like a puppy.

31:30.333 --> 31:33.813
Love me, love me, love me.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.421
I did.

31:36.596 --> 31:38.597
I did right away.

31:38.683 --> 31:42.206
Extraordinary,
as in phenomenal...

31:42.337 --> 31:44.859
as in a gold mine.

31:44.946 --> 31:49.991
Tough, vulnerable, old, young...

31:50.635 --> 31:52.810
decadent, innocent...

31:52.896 --> 31:54.897
male, female.

31:57.245 --> 31:59.898
You look like you don't give a shit.

32:04.361 --> 32:07.318
I met somebody,
someone I really like.

32:07.404 --> 32:10.449
Good. Good for you.

32:12.198 --> 32:15.285
Take a deep breath, darling.

32:15.372 --> 32:19.634
You are in for the ride
of your life.

32:36.318 --> 32:38.753
Paolo.

32:40.840 --> 32:44.537
Lower the fucking drawbridge.
Give me some of those drink tickets.

32:44.624 --> 32:48.755
Always a pleasure to see you too,
Stephie, and this must be Gia.

32:48.843 --> 32:51.147
How do you know my name?

32:51.235 --> 32:53.409
I'm god, I know everything.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.540
See, even god knows your name.

32:55.583 --> 32:58.497
With a face like that,
she doesn't need a name.

32:58.628 --> 33:02.628
Actually, Tony,
my face is a little higher.

33:04.838 --> 33:07.752
Anytime, Gia, anytime.

33:07.839 --> 33:10.014
Stop being stingy, Tony.

33:18.921 --> 33:21.487
That's something to be on-
downers and champagne.

33:21.573 --> 33:23.617
Very rich.

33:23.661 --> 33:25.748
Ooh, did him in a car once.

33:26.009 --> 33:28.836
I can't remember exactly
how fast we were going.

33:30.263 --> 33:34.177
That's Stan Girardi. Used to do it
with Cheryl, but he's doable.

33:34.264 --> 33:37.917
Ooh, Joe Jamison.
Beautiful, but gay.

33:38.179 --> 33:40.309
Not that that'd ever stop me.

33:43.528 --> 33:46.224
A little tongue up his ass...

33:46.267 --> 33:47.963
and he's all yours.

33:56.323 --> 33:58.019
You're full of shit, aren't you?

33:58.106 --> 34:02.194
Sometimes I don't believe it,
but it's all true.

34:02.281 --> 34:04.325
Okay, break it up.

34:05.891 --> 34:07.804
- On your left.
- Who was that?

34:07.934 --> 34:09.239
I have no idea.

34:33.413 --> 34:38.152
I do be the prettiest, prettiest girl.
I do be that.

34:50.592 --> 34:55.331
No, she's new, brand-new.
You have to see her. You'll like her.

35:06.422 --> 35:08.770
- She's on the cover.
- Gia, yeah.

35:08.858 --> 35:11.727
No last name.
Just Gia.

35:41.650 --> 35:42.694
Boring.

35:43.868 --> 35:45.999
Played out.

35:46.129 --> 35:47.738
Fat.

35:50.044 --> 35:51.348
Boring.

35:52.871 --> 35:54.175
Too dumb.

35:54.263 --> 35:57.394
For winter, we need meat.

35:57.524 --> 36:00.176
We need someone
with blood in her veins.

36:00.177 --> 36:02.829
Not just suntan oil
and mineral water.

36:04.283 --> 36:08.458
Oh, God, I am so sick of her face.

36:13.589 --> 36:18.025
- Who's this?
- One of Wilhelmina's new girls, Gia.

36:27.332 --> 36:29.942
This is meat.

36:29.985 --> 36:34.073
This is sirloin.
It's lusty.

36:34.160 --> 36:38.683
Winter is carnivorous-
rich browns, reds, big animal prints.

36:38.770 --> 36:40.771
This is it. Yes!

36:55.541 --> 36:57.845
I just bought it.
What do you think?

36:57.933 --> 36:59.976
- Wow.
- "Wow"?

37:03.107 --> 37:05.108
Wanna go for a ride?

37:05.195 --> 37:08.935
- I don't know.
- Oh, oh, yeah, you do. Come on.

37:15.172 --> 37:16.477
Yes!

37:20.304 --> 37:22.608
- Where we going? What?
- Philadelphia.

37:25.697 --> 37:28.958
- Hold on!
- I am!

37:31.533 --> 37:32.533
Yeah?

37:34.447 --> 37:36.708
Hi, Kathleen.

37:38.969 --> 37:40.970
My God.

37:43.188 --> 37:46.885
Oh, my God!
Come on in.

37:47.928 --> 37:50.538
- Come on.
- This is my girlfriend, Linda.

37:50.669 --> 37:55.713
Linda? Yeah, hi.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

37:55.757 --> 37:57.540
So, tell me about New York.

37:57.627 --> 38:00.628
Oh, God, it was like seeing
an old girlfriend.

38:00.758 --> 38:04.019
Oh, yeah, she told me all the gossip
about all the models.

38:04.063 --> 38:09.238
You know, who had bad skin
and who had bad hair.

38:09.264 --> 38:11.396
The things that they did,
she told me about.

38:11.475 --> 38:13.997
And the places that they went-
Oh, my God.

38:15.684 --> 38:17.859
Oh, my God!

38:17.946 --> 38:21.033
You're on the cover of Vogue!
I can't believe it.

38:22.086 --> 38:26.087
Oh, my God, isn't that beautiful?

38:26.174 --> 38:28.697
Oh, honey.

38:28.828 --> 38:33.089
So what else is going on, huh?
Do you have a boyfriend?

38:33.176 --> 38:36.264
Uh, no.
Linda has a boyfriend.

38:36.351 --> 38:39.352
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's nice.

38:40.786 --> 38:44.919
- I have a girlfriend.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice too...

38:45.049 --> 38:47.789
though it's not
the same thing, is it?

38:47.876 --> 38:51.660
And we never talked about the past.
That was over.

38:51.790 --> 38:56.312
The past was the past.
She never discussed it with me once.

38:56.356 --> 39:00.487
It was like it never happened-
all those years in between.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.541
It was like it never happened.

39:03.628 --> 39:07.064
I kept everything you've sent me.

39:07.151 --> 39:09.848
I keep everything
you ever touched...

39:09.978 --> 39:11.935
ever since you were a baby.

39:11.978 --> 39:15.067
What do I have?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

39:15.109 --> 39:17.154
My journal.

39:21.459 --> 39:24.503
Once upon a time-

39:26.417 --> 39:29.984
"Once upon a time,
there was a girl with golden hair...

39:30.070 --> 39:34.463
who went to live
in a beautiful house."

39:34.767 --> 39:37.028
Always the same story.

39:37.159 --> 39:41.160
Always different,
always the same.

39:41.203 --> 39:43.334
Always the same.

39:48.650 --> 39:49.780
Can I see?

39:51.259 --> 39:52.912
Yeah.

39:59.261 --> 40:02.566
Sometimes I think she was
a different person to everybody.

40:04.654 --> 40:06.785
Sometimes I knew who she was.

40:07.959 --> 40:10.873
Sometimes I didn't.

40:10.916 --> 40:15.526
Anybody who tries to tell you
exactly who she was...

40:15.788 --> 40:17.222
they didn't know her at all.

40:19.945 --> 40:21.825
We did everything together.
Yeah, in those days.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.077
Yeah, everything.

40:30.506 --> 40:31.854
All right.

40:37.289 --> 40:38.942
This is-

40:41.116 --> 40:44.074
What can I say?
It's you.

40:44.205 --> 40:45.639
I found it on short notice.

40:48.319 --> 40:50.710
That's what it looks like.

40:52.016 --> 40:54.668
So, I was standing
in the middle of the living room...

40:54.755 --> 40:57.277
and the bathroom door opens.

40:59.948 --> 41:01.688
- Yeah?
- Who's that?

41:01.818 --> 41:03.384
Who?

41:08.360 --> 41:11.360
I started making trips
to New York regularly after that.

41:11.447 --> 41:14.448
She wanted me there.
She wanted me there all the time.

41:14.579 --> 41:17.275
I couldn't because I had a husband,
I had a home.

41:17.580 --> 41:21.450
No, not red.
Yellow. Yellow roses.

41:21.755 --> 41:25.103
But I would go,
and I would stay for maybe a week.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.234
Sometimes I would stay two.

41:27.321 --> 41:29.800
Love on ya, Gia.

41:33.236 --> 41:36.454
You're sending flowers to a girl?

41:37.758 --> 41:40.629
- Here, lady.
- Hi. Got it. Thanks.

41:50.319 --> 41:53.059
Christ, another one?

41:53.145 --> 41:56.886
- Who died?
- None of your business.

42:00.452 --> 42:03.409
Are you fucking a florist
behind my back?

42:03.496 --> 42:07.584
Yeah. Gold FTD guy
with the winged shoes.

42:15.196 --> 42:16.500
Hi.

42:20.484 --> 42:22.354
I've been calling you for weeks.

42:22.440 --> 42:23.876
Hi, Gia.

42:26.703 --> 42:31.748
- This is my boyfriend, Billy.
- Hi. I'm wrecked.

42:35.340 --> 42:38.601
- Do you wanna come in?
- I don't think that's a good idea.

42:38.733 --> 42:41.428
Why not?

42:41.516 --> 42:44.603
You are really beautiful.

42:44.699 --> 42:46.874
You're a model, aren't you?

42:47.135 --> 42:49.222
Why? Do I look stupid?

42:51.275 --> 42:54.537
- I have to work tomorrow.
- Come on, it's early.

42:54.624 --> 42:58.755
Maybe-Maybe we could party.

43:08.106 --> 43:11.019
You are the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

43:11.107 --> 43:12.976
Come with me.

43:13.107 --> 43:14.411
I can't.

43:26.832 --> 43:28.137
See you around.

43:35.487 --> 43:37.488
What the fuck was that?

43:39.184 --> 43:41.185
Behold the florist.

44:27.119 --> 44:29.119
I cannot stay!

44:30.294 --> 44:34.208
I'll come back,
but I have to go home now.

44:34.295 --> 44:36.165
I'll come back.

44:40.532 --> 44:42.707
If you need me, you just call me.

44:42.793 --> 44:45.402
I need you.
I need you now.

44:45.490 --> 44:47.882
You have to be here now!

44:47.968 --> 44:52.578
When I need you, I need you! Now!
I need you, Mom!

44:52.666 --> 44:57.841
Listen to me.
You are a big girl, all right?

44:59.798 --> 45:03.233
- Please! Please!
- Act like a big girl.

45:03.390 --> 45:07.000
You've got to.
And you are.

45:08.574 --> 45:11.140
So be my big girl.

45:13.394 --> 45:14.872
Now listen to me.

45:19.352 --> 45:22.700
I have to go home.

45:22.830 --> 45:24.352
I have to.

45:24.483 --> 45:26.614
Fine. Fine!

45:28.258 --> 45:30.302
- Get out!
- All right, now wait.

45:30.433 --> 45:33.912
- Get the fuck out!
- No, not like this.

45:33.999 --> 45:36.608
Yeah, like this! Get out!
There. Get the fuck out!

45:36.695 --> 45:38.739
- For God's sake.
- Get out!

45:38.870 --> 45:41.305
- Not like this, not like this.
- Yeah, like this. Get the fuck out!

45:41.435 --> 45:43.741
- Look.
- There, get out!

45:43.871 --> 45:47.090
- All right. Fine, fine, fine. Fine.
- Go, go!

45:47.176 --> 45:50.133
- All right, fine.
- Get out!

45:53.439 --> 45:54.874
That's it.

45:56.048 --> 45:57.527
That-

46:22.595 --> 46:26.726
She's booked for 16 shoots this week,
but I'll see what we can do.

46:26.814 --> 46:28.379
And you are erupting forms...

46:28.467 --> 46:29.727
Tell Scavullo he can have her-

46:29.858 --> 46:32.902
out of the center
of all this tired, old beauty.

46:33.033 --> 46:34.685
Shaming them.

46:34.772 --> 46:38.165
Excuse me?
Tired, old beauty?

46:38.295 --> 46:43.384
You can have Renee. I know you want Gia,
but you can't have Gia. Not until June.

46:43.470 --> 46:46.993
This little wop is not standing
in front of me. You got that?

46:47.124 --> 46:49.211
I'm off to the side, or I walk.

46:49.342 --> 46:51.864
Yeah, me too.

46:51.950 --> 46:53.390
Does this dress
make my ass look fat?

46:53.473 --> 46:56.039
Your ass is fat, honey.

46:56.126 --> 46:59.170
And I'm not standing
next to her fat ass.

47:03.449 --> 47:04.928
I know.

47:08.504 --> 47:11.591
Life is so disappointing.

47:11.722 --> 47:14.113
Here you are.

47:14.201 --> 47:16.288
You have arrived.

47:16.549 --> 47:20.463
You are here.
This is your moment.

47:22.429 --> 47:24.908
What do you have?

47:24.995 --> 47:27.039
You have pain.

47:30.484 --> 47:33.397
When you have everything...

47:33.485 --> 47:36.007
what do you have?

47:36.094 --> 47:39.094
You have nothing.

47:39.095 --> 47:43.183
When everything is right,
everything is wrong.

47:44.357 --> 47:47.749
It's disappointing.
It's confusing.

47:47.837 --> 47:51.533
This is life.
What can you do?

47:54.316 --> 47:57.056
People keep going away from me.
That hurts.

48:00.327 --> 48:01.632
Work.

48:02.032 --> 48:04.727
Work.
You have a gift.

48:04.859 --> 48:06.554
Use it.

48:06.598 --> 48:09.860
Life will be there later.

48:09.990 --> 48:13.861
When you've worked
and you've lived...

48:15.114 --> 48:17.636
and you know who you are,
life is easy.

48:19.463 --> 48:21.767
Work.

48:21.855 --> 48:24.377
It's the only answer I know.

48:25.630 --> 48:27.456
I should've been a rock star.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.440
But I can't sing.

48:35.658 --> 48:37.529
Work now.

48:37.659 --> 48:39.659
You can live later.

48:42.191 --> 48:44.669
You'd say anything
to get that shot.

48:45.583 --> 48:47.669
- Yes.
- Yes.

48:47.670 --> 48:50.759
In this case,
I'm saying the truth.

48:53.846 --> 48:54.977
Sweetheart.

48:55.064 --> 48:58.456
Now here's the picture.
You girls all hate Gia...

48:58.717 --> 49:01.369
because she is so much prettier
than the rest of you.

49:01.500 --> 49:04.545
You're all so boring.

49:04.631 --> 49:07.328
She is so exciting.

49:07.415 --> 49:11.895
If you don't like it,
please vanish from my world.

49:11.937 --> 49:13.938
No, I'm sorry,
she's not available.

49:14.025 --> 49:15.765
I know, darling.
You can't get-

49:15.852 --> 49:18.200
And she went to live
in a beautiful house...

49:18.331 --> 49:22.376
and all the people loved her,
and she was very, very happy.

49:22.462 --> 49:26.507
No, she's on her way to Rome then.
She's shooting Versace in Milan...

49:26.594 --> 49:28.464
and Yves St. -Laurent in Paris.

49:28.551 --> 49:31.421
Perry has her for
the only runway show she's doing.

49:31.552 --> 49:34.553
But the people in the village
were very poor...

49:34.639 --> 49:37.684
and every night, they crept
into the house where the girl slept...

49:37.770 --> 49:40.859
and they cut off a piece
of her golden hair...

49:40.989 --> 49:42.120
and they sold it for money.

49:42.207 --> 49:45.642
"She'll never even notice,"
they said.

49:45.773 --> 49:48.512
And so, all the gold
was gone from her head.

49:48.817 --> 49:51.339
It's a real Cinderella story.

49:55.707 --> 49:58.534
Tell him to hurry.
Where's my tickets?

49:58.664 --> 49:59.969
You are wired.

50:01.796 --> 50:05.013
Here.
Try some of this.

50:06.405 --> 50:08.449
What? What is it?

50:08.537 --> 50:11.842
The answer to all your prayers.

50:51.905 --> 50:56.254
The only thing you have to remember
is that it's not about you.

50:56.559 --> 51:01.126
It's not about you.
It's not you that they're looking at.

51:01.212 --> 51:03.344
It's not about you.

51:03.430 --> 51:07.127
I'm on top of that.
I understand that.

51:07.258 --> 51:10.432
Honey, that's good.
I'm so glad about that.

51:10.519 --> 51:15.564
Because if you let it be about you,
you're screwed, you know.

51:15.694 --> 51:19.130
So, you have to stay separate
from what's happening...

51:19.217 --> 51:22.131
and you have to be somewhere else.

51:22.261 --> 51:26.088
But I don't know where
that somewhere else is, you know?

51:26.176 --> 51:28.089
Or how to do that.

51:28.219 --> 51:32.220
Honey, you can do
whatever you want now.

51:32.351 --> 51:34.830
Yeah? What is it I want?

51:34.873 --> 51:36.918
What do I want?

51:50.400 --> 51:55.532
I will be king,
and you will be queen.

52:06.500 --> 52:09.544
I don't think a woman
is really a woman...

52:09.632 --> 52:11.806
unless she's a blonde, you know.

52:13.111 --> 52:16.241
Response is so enormous.

52:16.242 --> 52:18.938
I've never seen anything like it.

52:19.069 --> 52:21.504
And so fast, huh?

52:21.592 --> 52:24.505
About a million people
want to shoot you this month.

52:24.593 --> 52:27.506
We're going to name
a whole phone line after you.

52:29.559 --> 52:32.298
I could learn photography.

52:32.430 --> 52:34.647
That could be something I want.

52:34.778 --> 52:37.735
I could photograph children.

52:37.821 --> 52:40.648
I could have my own children.

52:40.780 --> 52:44.128
I would give them yellow roses.

52:44.215 --> 52:48.998
And if they got too loud,
I would just put them someplace quiet.

52:49.530 --> 52:51.531
I'd put them in the oven.

52:52.661 --> 52:55.053
And I would kiss them every day...

52:57.227 --> 53:00.272
and tell them,
"You don't have to be anybody...

53:00.358 --> 53:05.491
because I would know, being somebody
doesn't make you anybody anyway."

53:08.048 --> 53:10.397
You will always be somebody to me.

53:13.614 --> 53:17.529
And on the financial front, with the
sudden illness of Wilhelmina Cooper...

53:17.616 --> 53:19.703
who's still hospitalized
in Manhattan...

53:19.704 --> 53:24.488
models and agents are competing
for the top talent and highest fees.

53:24.531 --> 53:26.748
With the latest news about inflation,
bonds rallied today...

53:26.879 --> 53:29.923
in reaction
to the president's speech.

53:30.010 --> 53:31.315
More news in a moment.

53:34.595 --> 53:38.205
She's doing all right. You know,
they're running some more tests.

53:38.291 --> 53:40.814
Maybe in a day or two
we'll know something.

53:41.945 --> 53:44.423
Come on, you gotta help me here.
I'm under a lot of pressure.

53:44.510 --> 53:46.555
I can't give you any answers.

53:49.582 --> 53:51.583
I was thinking a lot
about you lately.

53:51.669 --> 53:54.626
It's terrible, terrible,
isn't it?

53:54.758 --> 53:58.889
Mike Mansfield,
starting up the new Largo Agency.

53:58.975 --> 54:01.542
What do you think
you're gonna do now?

54:01.628 --> 54:03.455
What do you mean?

54:03.585 --> 54:06.239
Well, you're a special girl...

54:08.369 --> 54:09.631
with special problems.

54:09.761 --> 54:12.414
I think you need special attention.

54:13.319 --> 54:15.363
You could go to Ford.

54:15.406 --> 54:19.538
There's always that asshole
over at Elite.

54:19.581 --> 54:22.931
But I think you should put
some serious thought in coming with me.

54:23.017 --> 54:25.105
Why? Why would I leave Wili?

54:27.323 --> 54:31.367
You have to start thinking
about yourself. You have to be tough.

54:31.411 --> 54:35.151
This is a business,
and in this business...

54:35.194 --> 54:37.804
you can't be represented
by a dead woman.

54:40.448 --> 54:41.448
Excuse me.

54:41.578 --> 54:44.232
Why don't you give me a call?

54:47.406 --> 54:49.712
Yes, darling, I know
it's so inconvenient.

54:49.842 --> 54:53.104
Get me a copy of the call sheet,
and tell Freddie I need to speak to him.

54:53.538 --> 54:55.844
- Done. I'll take care of it.
- Gia, darling, kiss me.

54:55.930 --> 54:58.931
Yes, I have to go too.

54:59.062 --> 55:04.368
Have a wonderful trip.
Tell Christian to behave himself.

55:04.454 --> 55:06.455
Ciao, darling.

55:08.082 --> 55:11.170
- I'm exhausted.
- Me too.

55:12.597 --> 55:15.336
Come here, come here, come here.

55:18.076 --> 55:19.990
I thought you were sick.

55:20.076 --> 55:24.121
I am sick, darling,
sick and tired...

55:24.209 --> 55:26.774
but it's not serious.

55:29.732 --> 55:32.036
- I'm tired too.
- You?

55:32.428 --> 55:33.819
Yeah.

55:33.950 --> 55:37.603
I think I wanna stop for a while.

55:37.647 --> 55:40.082
You know,
I need some time to think.

55:40.212 --> 55:44.301
Yes, but not now, darling.

55:44.387 --> 55:49.128
Plenty of time to rest
when you're in the ground.

55:49.423 --> 55:51.424
You have...

55:51.511 --> 55:55.208
the whole world...

55:55.295 --> 55:58.382
at your fingertips.

55:58.426 --> 56:03.993
You have to be strong.
Seize the moment.

56:05.123 --> 56:08.211
Because if you don't...

56:08.429 --> 56:11.039
there's always another girl
waiting right behind you...

56:11.125 --> 56:14.213
breathing over your shoulder.

56:19.284 --> 56:20.893
Come on.

56:22.242 --> 56:25.721
I know. I know it's hard.

56:25.808 --> 56:27.852
We can do it.

56:29.419 --> 56:31.811
You and I together.

56:43.378 --> 56:46.249
She really looked dead, didn't she?

56:46.336 --> 56:48.553
The great thing about the afterlife
is nobody cares how you look.

56:48.684 --> 56:50.336
Like an average girl.

56:51.989 --> 56:54.599
Too rich and too thin.

56:55.817 --> 57:01.209
- I had no idea she was that sick.
- You can never tell with Germans.

57:29.382 --> 57:30.860
God!

58:21.005 --> 58:23.962
Great. That's beautiful.

58:24.094 --> 58:25.745
Really nice. Cool.

58:26.007 --> 58:28.529
Can you roll your eyes back a little
so we can see the white under them?

58:28.686 --> 58:31.773
- We're going for the seppuku look.
- What is that?

58:31.799 --> 58:35.235
Japanese. Sorry, it means
that you're half dead.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.610
- I'm there.
- I know, it's great.

58:37.697 --> 58:41.785
You are doing so good.

58:43.438 --> 58:44.742
Really, you look super.

58:46.916 --> 58:48.961
Oh, my God.
Did you almost just throw up?

58:49.048 --> 58:51.179
I'm really sick.

58:51.266 --> 58:55.354
- Can you go make a run downtown for me?
- Don't throw up on this dress.

58:55.615 --> 58:58.225
Just-I'm sick.
Go downtown.

58:58.355 --> 59:02.617
All right? There's a taco place,
and you ask for Satellite or Rich Boy.

59:02.877 --> 59:05.009
Okay? Yeah?

59:05.139 --> 59:07.531
- Chasing the dragon, are you?
- I'm sorry.

59:07.618 --> 59:11.967
Oh, no, it works, it works.
A little death around the eyes.

59:12.098 --> 59:16.794
Okay, great. Fabulous.
Great. Good.

59:16.881 --> 59:19.535
That's really great.
Oh, that's great.

59:21.919 --> 59:27.225
Fantastic. Right by the bike.
Good. Bad girl, bad girl.

59:27.311 --> 59:29.051
Good.

59:31.443 --> 59:32.878
Yeah, that's it. Great.

59:32.966 --> 59:36.574
Good. Fantastic.

59:36.705 --> 59:40.707
- She's out of her fucking mind?
- Could Cheryl Tiegs do this?

59:40.837 --> 59:42.881
I don't think so.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.195
Go.

59:55.632 --> 01:00:00.764
Hey, wait!
Hey, where you going?

01:01:24.805 --> 01:01:27.631
Hey, where's Satellite?
Is he here?

01:01:31.842 --> 01:01:33.320
Come here.

01:01:34.625 --> 01:01:36.104
Fuck.

01:02:09.018 --> 01:02:10.192
Hey, you bitch.

01:02:44.445 --> 01:02:45.488
Where's Satellite?

01:02:47.533 --> 01:02:49.577
Where is Satellite?

01:02:52.795 --> 01:02:58.492
I am sick, fucking junkies.
I'm sick! Where is he?

01:02:58.622 --> 01:03:00.841
He's making a delivery.

01:03:03.051 --> 01:03:07.835
- Is anybody holding anything? Please!
- I'll give you my shot.

01:03:10.357 --> 01:03:13.575
I don't shoot. Do you have
anything else dry?

01:03:13.661 --> 01:03:15.576
No, man.

01:03:15.706 --> 01:03:17.445
All I got is in here.

01:03:19.751 --> 01:03:21.360
I can't.

01:03:23.969 --> 01:03:27.187
- Okay, if you don't want it.
- Wait.

01:03:31.685 --> 01:03:34.251
I want it. You do me.
Will you do it?

01:03:39.496 --> 01:03:41.061
Yeah, I'll do you.

01:03:57.535 --> 01:03:59.535
This is gonna hurt.

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:03.276
No pain.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.843
Thank you.

01:04:10.669 --> 01:04:12.495
Don't be scared, baby.

01:04:13.757 --> 01:04:15.322
I'll take you home.

01:05:00.953 --> 01:05:02.562
Oh, God.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:07.189
I was thinking about you.

01:05:15.756 --> 01:05:17.497
Are you okay?

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:25.020
Is your boyfriend here?

01:05:26.317 --> 01:05:28.621
I don't have a boyfriend anymore.

01:05:40.042 --> 01:05:41.433
I'm all dirty.

01:06:14.443 --> 01:06:17.313
I was afraid of the drugs.

01:06:17.443 --> 01:06:19.835
The way people use them.

01:06:19.966 --> 01:06:22.575
I told her that.
I mean, she knew that.

01:06:23.707 --> 01:06:26.098
I was afraid of a lot of things.

01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:29.491
But she promised...

01:06:29.578 --> 01:06:31.404
and I believed her.

01:06:31.535 --> 01:06:35.666
And I believed
we could make things work.

01:06:35.797 --> 01:06:39.667
I believed because we both
wanted it so much that we could.

01:06:39.798 --> 01:06:41.537
We could-

01:06:44.355 --> 01:06:45.835
And we did.

01:06:47.574 --> 01:06:49.618
We did make it work.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400
You're coming home?

01:07:43.444 --> 01:07:45.140
Just out of the blue
you're coming home?

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:47.228
Just like that you call me?

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:52.012
You are a piece of work,
you are.

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:54.186
Philadelphia?

01:07:54.316 --> 01:07:56.970
The bitch is in Philadelphia?

01:07:57.056 --> 01:08:00.927
I'm killing myself
trying to keep this agency alive...

01:08:01.187 --> 01:08:02.796
which is not easy...

01:08:02.928 --> 01:08:07.754
since my wife with her dying breath
screwed me out of 50% of the company.

01:08:07.842 --> 01:08:10.190
Fucking women.

01:08:10.321 --> 01:08:12.321
And now you tell me
this little...

01:08:13.234 --> 01:08:16.234
whatever just disappears.

01:08:16.322 --> 01:08:19.584
I hope she fucking dies
in Philadelphia.

01:08:22.889 --> 01:08:24.889
It's a 21-day program.

01:08:25.194 --> 01:08:29.542
It's your responsibility to come in
every day and take the Methodone.

01:08:32.935 --> 01:08:35.283
All right.
Drink the water.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.937
That's all right.

01:08:38.023 --> 01:08:40.241
I need you to drink the water.

01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:48.461
And sign next to the line.

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.169
Okay.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:05.545
Dwayne King.

01:09:06.457 --> 01:09:09.676
There you are, Mr. Doodiekins.
Fresh from the oven.

01:09:09.763 --> 01:09:11.590
Thank you, Mrs. Doodiekins.

01:09:22.106 --> 01:09:23.845
I could do this, you know that?

01:09:23.933 --> 01:09:26.237
I could be a fucking housewife.

01:09:26.325 --> 01:09:28.064
I'd be very happy.

01:10:04.854 --> 01:10:07.854
It's very depressing,
this apartment.

01:10:07.855 --> 01:10:10.856
All right, all right.
"Shut up, Mom."

01:10:10.942 --> 01:10:12.943
So, is Linda coming back tonight...

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:15.031
or is she staying in New York?

01:10:15.117 --> 01:10:17.988
I don't know.
If she works late, she's gonna stay.

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:23.772
I hate what this Methodone
is doing to your shoulders.

01:10:23.858 --> 01:10:27.598
They used to stand up so straight,
so beautiful.

01:10:27.729 --> 01:10:29.512
Come on.

01:10:35.774 --> 01:10:38.863
Well, you have to watch
your weight too.

01:10:38.993 --> 01:10:41.385
You want to look good
for when you go back to work.

01:10:43.473 --> 01:10:45.430
- I'm not going back to work.
- Okay.

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.256
- I can't.
- All right.

01:10:47.343 --> 01:10:49.387
Do you understand that?

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:53.310
That's up to you, you know.

01:10:53.397 --> 01:10:55.745
But just wait. You'll see.

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:07.506
Hi, this is Linda.
I'm not here. Leave a message.

01:11:08.114 --> 01:11:10.071
Hi, Doo-doo. It's me.

01:11:10.159 --> 01:11:13.072
I've been calling all night.
Where are you?

01:11:14.203 --> 01:11:16.377
- Linda?
- Hello?

01:11:17.552 --> 01:11:21.552
- Who's this?
- This is Billy. Who's this?

01:11:32.269 --> 01:11:35.661
Damn it!
Goddamn it, Gia!

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.836
Oh, my God,
she broke into my house.

01:11:39.967 --> 01:11:42.968
She stole some money.

01:11:43.054 --> 01:11:46.229
She stole jewelry.
She bought the drugs...

01:11:46.273 --> 01:11:49.186
and then she took off in the car
like a crazy person.

01:11:49.274 --> 01:11:51.839
It was unbelievable.

01:11:51.970 --> 01:11:53.926
She took my wedding ring!

01:11:54.058 --> 01:11:57.058
- Stop the vehicle and pull over.
- And the lies.

01:11:57.337 --> 01:12:01.425
You know that old joke, how you
can tell when a junkie is lying?

01:12:01.512 --> 01:12:03.512
Her lips are moving.

01:12:04.469 --> 01:12:06.470
It's not funny.

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.404
Get out of the car.

01:12:21.535 --> 01:12:23.840
- Why are you chasing me? Are you crazy?
- Lady-

01:12:23.927 --> 01:12:26.492
I'm trying to get to New York,
and you're fucking chasing me?

01:12:26.536 --> 01:12:29.102
- All right, ma'am. Calm down.
- What is wrong with you?

01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:31.711
- God! What?
- Ma'am?

01:12:32.233 --> 01:12:36.191
What the-Just back off, okay?
God!

01:12:36.234 --> 01:12:38.626
- Ma'am?
- I have to go.

01:12:43.819 --> 01:12:45.864
Get fucking arrested for nothing,
that's why.

01:12:45.907 --> 01:12:48.430
These are serious charges.
Reckless driving.

01:12:48.516 --> 01:12:52.126
- This is resisting arrest.
- Goddamn it! It's not my fault!

01:12:52.169 --> 01:12:53.735
It was not my fault either!

01:12:53.822 --> 01:12:55.862
He was there getting some stuff
out of my apartment!

01:12:55.909 --> 01:12:58.736
I wasn't even there!
I was on my way back here!

01:13:00.563 --> 01:13:03.216
Thank God, because otherwise,
you'd still be in jail.

01:13:03.303 --> 01:13:05.215
I have to go back to work.

01:13:05.216 --> 01:13:07.348
I know what you're gonna say,
but I need the money.

01:13:08.609 --> 01:13:10.653
Stop it!

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.872
I need the money so I can be with you,
because I cannot live like this.

01:13:15.002 --> 01:13:17.959
Okay? I can't live like this.

01:13:18.046 --> 01:13:20.221
And I can't live without you.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:23.109
You want to come to Largo now.

01:13:25.718 --> 01:13:27.980
Is that because everyone else
is afraid of signing you?

01:13:28.066 --> 01:13:30.111
No, I haven't asked anyone else.

01:13:30.241 --> 01:13:32.199
Then why me?

01:13:33.112 --> 01:13:35.156
Because you're a greedy fuck...

01:13:35.286 --> 01:13:38.504
and you'll get me more money
than anyone else.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:40.331
That's the truth.

01:13:44.541 --> 01:13:47.629
So, let me be truthful with you.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:53.717
Everyone's aware of the drug problem.

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:55.109
You weren't very discreet.

01:13:56.153 --> 01:13:58.719
Well, I'm clean now...

01:13:58.763 --> 01:14:01.155
and I want to work.

01:14:07.157 --> 01:14:10.243
Let me see your arms.

01:14:12.374 --> 01:14:14.984
It's not my arms you want.
It's my face...

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:17.072
and my tits.

01:14:17.289 --> 01:14:19.159
And they're fine.

01:14:24.213 --> 01:14:26.214
We're doing a television piece
on models.

01:14:26.301 --> 01:14:28.823
I want you to be in it.

01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:32.954
I want you to look more beautiful...

01:14:32.998 --> 01:14:35.781
than you have ever looked.

01:14:35.912 --> 01:14:38.782
And I want you to tell the world...

01:14:39.513 --> 01:14:44.036
that you once had a drug problem
and now you don't.

01:14:44.166 --> 01:14:46.949
Now you're a good little girl.

01:14:50.429 --> 01:14:52.300
If you do that...

01:14:53.516 --> 01:14:55.387
we have a deal.

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:05.816
Okay.

01:15:08.947 --> 01:15:10.947
Good.

01:15:15.741 --> 01:15:17.872
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:19.960
I'm a model. I don't talk.

01:15:20.046 --> 01:15:23.091
I'm not supposed to talk.
I'm supposed to just look beautiful.

01:15:24.221 --> 01:15:26.134
You are beautiful.

01:15:27.134 --> 01:15:29.353
You make me beautiful.

01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.223
Hello.

01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:33.180
Okay. We're all set.

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:35.746
I'm gonna tape you getting made up.
Kind of a before and after thing.

01:15:35.833 --> 01:15:38.094
- Great.
- We've also got some interviews...

01:15:38.225 --> 01:15:40.486
set up with your friends,
your family, your mother.

01:15:40.573 --> 01:15:42.704
You're gonna
put my mother on tape?

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:46.226
- Yes, most definitely.
- Well, that should be interesting.

01:15:48.323 --> 01:15:50.977
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:52.412
Good.

01:15:53.630 --> 01:15:56.456
- I just have to go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

01:15:57.935 --> 01:16:00.414
Why don't you guys come over here?
This is what I want.

01:16:48.349 --> 01:16:51.394
And how did things first start
for you in modeling?

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.960
I started working
with very good people.

01:16:57.003 --> 01:17:00.439
A lot of them.
Very fast, you know?

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:04.919
I didn't build
into being a model.

01:17:05.005 --> 01:17:07.397
I just sort of became one.

01:17:07.528 --> 01:17:10.094
How has that affected you?

01:17:12.513 --> 01:17:15.644
When you're young,
you don't always know.

01:17:16.688 --> 01:17:21.123
It's hard to make out
the difference between...

01:17:21.211 --> 01:17:23.906
what's real and what is not real.

01:17:25.647 --> 01:17:28.343
At one point you...

01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:31.387
kind of got into
the drug scene, didn't you?

01:17:35.728 --> 01:17:38.815
Yes, you could say that I did.

01:17:38.903 --> 01:17:41.251
But you're free of it now,
aren't you?

01:17:42.973 --> 01:17:45.539
Definitely, I'm free of it.

01:17:45.626 --> 01:17:49.148
I wouldn't be here right now
talking to all of you if I wasn't.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.323
Are you happy with your success?

01:17:54.933 --> 01:17:57.151
Are you happy with your success?

01:17:57.194 --> 01:17:58.977
I am.

01:18:00.239 --> 01:18:03.065
Yes. Yeah.

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:06.457
You hesitated.

01:18:08.458 --> 01:18:12.677
I just wanted to think about it.
But, no, I'm definitely happy with it.

01:18:12.807 --> 01:18:15.242
Good. Thank you.

01:18:15.330 --> 01:18:17.373
Yeah, thank you.

01:18:38.537 --> 01:18:41.669
Fuck! What the fuck?

01:18:42.755 --> 01:18:45.800
I, like, kicked Spider-Man's ass!

01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:53.176
I'm sorry.

01:19:01.143 --> 01:19:02.970
I just wanted to make you smile.

01:19:10.276 --> 01:19:11.841
Okay.

01:19:12.102 --> 01:19:14.712
Okay, I'm going.
Last chance.

01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:19.704
I'm leaving
through the front door.

01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:21.792
I can't do this.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.880
Don't say that.
Just say you'll see me tomorrow.

01:19:23.967 --> 01:19:26.968
- No, you won't see me tomorrow.
- Don't say that!

01:19:29.186 --> 01:19:32.187
We had a deal.
We made a bargain.

01:19:36.631 --> 01:19:38.241
I love you.

01:19:40.067 --> 01:19:41.807
No, you don't.

01:19:43.633 --> 01:19:46.068
All right, I don't.
I don't.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:52.975
What are you, huh?
You some kind of fucking policeman?

01:19:53.106 --> 01:19:55.802
You going to judge me?
I did one fucking line.

01:19:55.932 --> 01:19:57.932
One line.

01:19:58.194 --> 01:20:00.456
What is the big deal?

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:03.630
What about yesterday?
What about the day before?

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.806
Nothing.

01:20:09.762 --> 01:20:11.806
I did nothing. I promise.

01:20:11.893 --> 01:20:13.893
Please don't leave me.

01:20:14.024 --> 01:20:15.981
I don't believe you.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.513
You don't believe me because
you don't want to believe me, do you?

01:20:22.643 --> 01:20:25.644
Because you don't care!
Because you just wanted to say...

01:20:25.688 --> 01:20:27.732
"I'm fucking a model!"

01:20:28.819 --> 01:20:30.646
You don't care about me
at all, do you?

01:20:30.907 --> 01:20:34.517
Do you? Tell me you don't care!
Say, "I don't care!"

01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:57.167
Please. I'm sorry.

01:20:58.907 --> 01:21:01.994
I need you so much.
Don't make me do this.

01:21:04.769 --> 01:21:06.813
I don't make you do anything.

01:21:06.944 --> 01:21:08.900
I wish I could.

01:21:10.075 --> 01:21:11.684
You could.

01:21:15.467 --> 01:21:17.468
You could take care of me.

01:21:26.036 --> 01:21:27.863
Do you have $30?

01:21:32.559 --> 01:21:34.691
I don't have any money.

01:21:34.995 --> 01:21:36.822
I don't know why.
I never have it.

01:21:37.082 --> 01:21:38.909
I never have any money.

01:21:44.475 --> 01:21:46.432
In my sock.

01:22:02.707 --> 01:22:06.055
- This is what makes you do everything.
- No, it doesn't.

01:22:06.143 --> 01:22:08.970
It's not me. It's not you.
It's this.

01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:11.057
This shit holds you.

01:22:13.014 --> 01:22:15.623
- You choose.
- Come on.

01:22:16.928 --> 01:22:20.016
This or me.

01:22:32.906 --> 01:22:34.472
Your finger.

01:22:37.125 --> 01:22:38.647
Your knees.

01:22:42.648 --> 01:22:44.040
Your skin.

01:22:45.345 --> 01:22:46.911
Your toes.

01:22:57.609 --> 01:22:59.304
I love you.

01:24:48.449 --> 01:24:50.189
Change.

01:25:16.535 --> 01:25:18.579
She is over.

01:25:20.536 --> 01:25:22.537
It's just a question
of time now.

01:25:29.687 --> 01:25:31.383
Hey, come on.

01:25:34.906 --> 01:25:37.863
- Hi.
- Yes, you are.

01:25:37.950 --> 01:25:39.907
You dropped this, honey.

01:25:40.994 --> 01:25:43.691
You want to come on and finish
this fiasco?

01:25:54.389 --> 01:25:56.390
You look so pretty.

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.140
Thanks.

01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:06.750
I love you.

01:26:08.880 --> 01:26:11.316
I know.
You love everybody.

01:26:18.797 --> 01:26:21.058
Gia, listen to me.
I am trying to get you work.

01:26:21.145 --> 01:26:23.797
But it's all spring stuff now.

01:26:23.885 --> 01:26:27.233
Everybody wants the blonds
with the suntans and the sundresses.

01:26:27.321 --> 01:26:30.234
I'm sorry.
No, your look is not spring.

01:26:30.278 --> 01:26:32.539
Your look is more like nuclear
fucking winter, and nobody wants it.

01:26:32.670 --> 01:26:35.148
Hang up the phone.

01:26:35.236 --> 01:26:37.236
I am so tense.

01:26:37.323 --> 01:26:40.150
Ron, can you use some of
those fucking muscles?

01:26:41.316 --> 01:26:42.707
I'm so tense.

01:26:43.873 --> 01:26:48.309
"When she kisses me, I feel
all four winds blow at my face.

01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.789
But what do you do with a woman
who has no love for you?

01:27:00.652 --> 01:27:03.479
She is my lost captive...

01:27:03.609 --> 01:27:07.131
and no longer lies
along my legs."

01:27:11.264 --> 01:27:13.263
I wrote that for you.

01:27:55.772 --> 01:27:59.772
- Why did they send her out?
- Because I asked for her.

01:27:59.903 --> 01:28:01.425
- All right?
- All right.

01:28:12.499 --> 01:28:14.500
We use them up...

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.501
throw them away.

01:28:25.694 --> 01:28:27.608
Where's my knife?

01:28:27.738 --> 01:28:29.912
I haven't seen it.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.043
Who took my fucking knife?

01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:37.001
Do I look like a fucking terrorist?
Is this funny?

01:28:37.132 --> 01:28:41.090
What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Get the fuck away from me!

01:28:41.176 --> 01:28:44.351
Get away!
Where's my knife?

01:28:46.743 --> 01:28:48.483
Here it is.

01:28:53.241 --> 01:28:55.285
You know, you can't do that.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:57.546
You can't take somebody's knife
when they need it!

01:28:57.677 --> 01:29:00.416
It's all right. It's fine.

01:29:01.721 --> 01:29:04.809
- Look at those tracks on her arms.
- Okay, now.

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:07.071
And that awful thing
on her hand.

01:29:07.158 --> 01:29:09.289
- It looks like a volcano.
- All right.

01:29:13.507 --> 01:29:15.508
Try folding your arms.

01:29:18.857 --> 01:29:20.900
Put them in back of you.

01:29:21.988 --> 01:29:24.032
Well, you've almost got it.

01:29:24.119 --> 01:29:26.207
Now, try sitting on your hands.

01:29:29.076 --> 01:29:30.512
Yes, yes.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.339
You look wonderful.

01:29:36.035 --> 01:29:37.775
Beautiful.

01:29:51.309 --> 01:29:54.180
- Francesco?
- Yes, sweetheart?

01:29:55.484 --> 01:29:57.267
Thank you.

01:29:59.868 --> 01:30:04.304
Gia, this is life, not heaven.

01:30:04.391 --> 01:30:06.392
You don't have to be perfect.

01:30:08.566 --> 01:30:12.350
Look at me. Where's those eyes?
Where's the mouth?

01:30:12.436 --> 01:30:15.828
What? You're not!

01:30:15.916 --> 01:30:17.916
Truly? You're on an airplane?

01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:20.387
Oh, my God! Listen to me!

01:30:20.474 --> 01:30:22.735
I'm so excited! I'm yelling!

01:30:22.866 --> 01:30:24.823
I don't have to yell, do I?

01:30:24.953 --> 01:30:27.867
- No, you don't have to yell.
- Henry!

01:30:27.998 --> 01:30:31.346
- Mom, I don't want to talk to Henry.
- Where is he? Hold on.

01:30:32.816 --> 01:30:34.687
Where are you?

01:30:34.773 --> 01:30:36.818
I mean, where is the airplane?

01:30:36.861 --> 01:30:39.949
I've never talked to anybody
on an airplane before.

01:30:41.340 --> 01:30:43.384
I was in Paris...

01:30:43.428 --> 01:30:45.776
and I think I'm going to Munich.

01:30:46.994 --> 01:30:48.777
I don't know.

01:30:49.908 --> 01:30:51.952
I don't feel so good.

01:30:53.257 --> 01:30:56.171
Well, honey, you're probably
just tired, you know?

01:30:57.258 --> 01:30:58.693
Yeah...

01:30:58.781 --> 01:31:00.824
and I'm cold.

01:31:03.781 --> 01:31:05.782
You know...

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:10.001
I was thinking about
coming home again.

01:31:10.088 --> 01:31:11.871
What do you think?

01:31:17.021 --> 01:31:19.717
Honey, I don't think so.

01:31:20.891 --> 01:31:22.805
You know?

01:31:27.458 --> 01:31:32.198
I mean, you know,
after the last time.

01:31:32.329 --> 01:31:34.634
Yeah, I know. Of course.

01:31:46.819 --> 01:31:48.342
I'm sorry.

01:31:52.091 --> 01:31:53.700
Yeah.

01:31:58.614 --> 01:32:00.223
I better go.

01:32:01.624 --> 01:32:03.668
All right. Okay.

01:32:03.973 --> 01:32:05.494
Listen to me.

01:32:05.712 --> 01:32:07.886
Now, you take care of yourself.

01:32:08.148 --> 01:32:09.974
Okay?

01:32:10.235 --> 01:32:12.453
You call me.

01:32:12.540 --> 01:32:14.671
Because I love you.

01:32:14.758 --> 01:32:18.193
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:22.090
Every model has a moment-

01:33:22.177 --> 01:33:24.177
I mean, the ones who
make it at all-

01:33:24.308 --> 01:33:26.265
and whether or not
they can parlay that moment...

01:33:26.396 --> 01:33:29.440
into some kind of a career-

01:33:29.527 --> 01:33:31.701
well, that's the gamble,
isn't it?

01:33:32.241 --> 01:33:34.415
'Cause the moment
is a very short time.

01:33:34.502 --> 01:33:37.024
It's here and then it's gone,
just like most of these girls.

01:33:37.286 --> 01:33:39.330
They're here...

01:33:39.416 --> 01:33:41.417
and then they're gone.

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:47.027
When she came back to New York...

01:33:47.158 --> 01:33:49.463
I was in Philadelphia.

01:33:49.593 --> 01:33:52.508
And I heard some things.

01:33:52.594 --> 01:33:55.073
A lot of things.

01:33:55.204 --> 01:33:57.378
So I took the train
up to see her.

01:34:19.671 --> 01:34:21.672
I can't find my money.

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:26.412
- What?
- I had $600, and I can't find it.

01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:37.981
What's going on?

01:34:38.242 --> 01:34:40.285
I can't find my money!

01:34:41.339 --> 01:34:42.860
What's wrong with you?

01:34:44.296 --> 01:34:46.514
What are you doing?

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:50.166
- Do you have any money?
- No, I don't have any money.

01:34:51.636 --> 01:34:53.637
You want to fuck me?

01:34:55.681 --> 01:34:57.769
You give me money,
I'll let you fuck me.

01:35:00.987 --> 01:35:03.770
- Come here.
- What?

01:35:06.597 --> 01:35:08.641
Get off! What?

01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:12.791
- Can I please hold you?
- Get off!

01:35:14.052 --> 01:35:15.661
No drugs.

01:35:16.966 --> 01:35:18.661
Get off of me!

01:35:18.793 --> 01:35:20.444
- Calm down.
- Okay.

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:41.738
Okay, do you have
any medical insurance?

01:35:44.173 --> 01:35:47.827
- Can you pay cash for this?
- No, I don't have any money.

01:35:50.784 --> 01:35:52.828
Stupid question.

01:35:55.133 --> 01:35:57.698
All right. You'll have to
declare yourself indigent.

01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:59.786
Do you understand that?

01:36:40.146 --> 01:36:41.885
Wait a minute.

01:36:42.016 --> 01:36:46.583
What, am I supposed to feel sorry
for you because you're beautiful?

01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:51.409
Because you made 10,000 a minute
doing fucking nothing?

01:36:51.497 --> 01:36:54.933
"Oh, it was so hard,
so terrible.

01:36:55.063 --> 01:36:57.150
They treated me so bad."

01:36:57.281 --> 01:37:00.108
Listen, girl.
You had a free ride...

01:37:00.194 --> 01:37:02.195
and you fucking blew it.

01:37:08.068 --> 01:37:09.633
And me?

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:12.243
I'm some kid from Ohio...

01:37:12.329 --> 01:37:16.852
reading fashion magazines,
looking at your picture and thinking...

01:37:16.983 --> 01:37:19.722
"I'm supposed to look like that"...

01:37:19.984 --> 01:37:23.810
and going fucking crazy
because I don't.

01:37:23.941 --> 01:37:26.941
Because nobody told me
it was a lie.

01:37:26.942 --> 01:37:31.465
Because the magazine doesn't come
with a label that says...

01:37:31.552 --> 01:37:35.727
"Caution. This is a lie.
Nobody looks like this."

01:37:35.814 --> 01:37:38.684
Not even you.

01:37:46.608 --> 01:37:50.044
Well, they asked me to go
to the sessions, so I did.

01:37:50.131 --> 01:37:51.739
I tried.

01:37:52.697 --> 01:37:55.872
I just got so mad.
I got so mad.

01:37:57.611 --> 01:38:01.090
I said to them, "Look, I'm not
the drug addict here.

01:38:01.221 --> 01:38:04.308
I'm not the one that
you should be ripping apart."

01:38:05.744 --> 01:38:07.962
I said, "This is all buried.

01:38:08.050 --> 01:38:11.007
Why don't you just let it be?"

01:38:11.093 --> 01:38:13.703
That's what I told 'em.
Look. I know.

01:38:13.833 --> 01:38:16.268
You want to blame somebody.
You want to blame me.

01:38:16.356 --> 01:38:18.617
Okay, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

01:38:20.008 --> 01:38:22.009
But just remember this:

01:38:22.096 --> 01:38:25.141
Everything I did,
I did because I loved her.

01:38:26.054 --> 01:38:28.054
And I believe
that it was my love...

01:38:28.141 --> 01:38:31.142
and my prayers
that got her through that.

01:38:43.389 --> 01:38:45.825
Hi, Linda. It's Gia.

01:38:45.955 --> 01:38:48.261
I'm calling to apologize.

01:38:49.435 --> 01:38:51.696
I'm in this program...

01:38:51.827 --> 01:38:55.349
and it's, like, part of the program
that we're supposed to...

01:38:55.436 --> 01:38:59.003
ask forgiveness of the people
that we hurt when we were drugging.

01:39:00.089 --> 01:39:04.178
I was, like, "Well, fuck, man.
That could take the rest of my life."

01:39:07.353 --> 01:39:09.178
I'm sorry.

01:39:09.266 --> 01:39:10.875
This is stupid.

01:39:16.077 --> 01:39:19.947
Anyway, I'm calling
to ask forgiveness...

01:39:20.034 --> 01:39:23.339
and to say that I miss you,
because-

01:39:25.645 --> 01:39:28.558
What is that?
Am I done?

01:39:28.646 --> 01:39:31.603
I think I'm done.
I don't know what happened.

01:39:31.689 --> 01:39:33.516
Hi, it's me.

01:39:41.145 --> 01:39:42.667
Boy, Linda.

01:39:44.885 --> 01:39:46.450
Yeah.

01:39:54.192 --> 01:39:56.496
Well, now I don't know
what to say.

01:39:58.497 --> 01:40:02.411
It's okay. I heard you.
I heard it all.

01:40:03.759 --> 01:40:05.499
Is that okay?

01:40:07.282 --> 01:40:09.326
Yeah.

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:22.574
I can't talk right now.
I have to go.

01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:24.835
Can I call you in a few days?

01:40:27.967 --> 01:40:30.924
I'm gonna be out in a few days,
and then I'm gonna call you, okay?

01:41:02.611 --> 01:41:04.786
You know how she's
always saying she's a model?

01:41:04.916 --> 01:41:07.090
Oh, my sweet Jesus!

01:41:07.220 --> 01:41:08.917
Is that her?

01:41:10.048 --> 01:41:12.248
I wonder if she's been folding
the same pair of jeans...

01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:14.831
for the last five minutes?

01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:18.911
And that's another thing.

01:41:18.998 --> 01:41:21.520
You don't want to work
in a place like that.

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:24.174
Ugly, ugly place.

01:41:24.304 --> 01:41:26.217
Ugly people.

01:41:26.304 --> 01:41:28.784
Mom, listen.
This is the good part.

01:41:28.914 --> 01:41:30.871
This is good.

01:41:30.958 --> 01:41:34.611
Everything's gonna be
really good from now on, okay?

01:41:41.717 --> 01:41:43.805
Look at this.
Look at your skin.

01:41:44.806 --> 01:41:46.241
Mom.

01:41:46.501 --> 01:41:48.242
What? It's just acne.

01:41:48.328 --> 01:41:50.329
It's okay. It'll go away.

01:41:50.416 --> 01:41:53.286
It's the drugs.
They're coming out of my system.

01:41:53.417 --> 01:41:55.851
I'm gonna look really good.

01:41:55.895 --> 01:41:58.157
And by Christmas,
I'm gonna look great.

01:41:58.287 --> 01:42:01.636
And we are gonna have
the best holiday ever.

01:42:02.323 --> 01:42:04.237
Why don't you come home?

01:42:04.324 --> 01:42:07.412
Move back in with me.
Would you like that?

01:42:14.153 --> 01:42:16.153
I gotta be alone.

01:42:18.023 --> 01:42:21.937
But can you lend me a few bucks
for coffee and toothpaste?

01:42:22.024 --> 01:42:23.459
Oh, the coffee!

01:42:23.764 --> 01:42:26.373
I'm sorry. I forgot.

01:42:27.504 --> 01:42:31.766
With the money you made, you could have
lived the rest of your life.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.958
Well, that's what happens,
I suppose.

01:42:38.524 --> 01:42:41.264
- What?
- I'm just feeling dizzy.

01:42:41.351 --> 01:42:42.699
- What is it?
- Mom.

01:42:46.605 --> 01:42:49.650
Oh, honey, you're burning up.

01:42:51.389 --> 01:42:54.477
- Why do my ears hurt?
- Oh, baby.

01:42:58.521 --> 01:43:00.087
Oh, my God.

01:43:09.760 --> 01:43:11.194
You have pneumonia...

01:43:11.326 --> 01:43:13.195
which we can treat.

01:43:15.239 --> 01:43:16.979
Gia, listen.

01:43:18.197 --> 01:43:22.415
There's something more serious
going on which caused your infection.

01:43:23.546 --> 01:43:27.634
Something they're calling
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

01:43:28.808 --> 01:43:30.809
Maybe you heard about it?

01:43:32.983 --> 01:43:34.940
How did I get it?

01:43:35.028 --> 01:43:37.245
Well, we're really
just finding things out...

01:43:37.376 --> 01:43:39.985
and you're the first woman
I've known about.

01:43:40.116 --> 01:43:43.638
Although, intravenous drug users seem
to be in a specially high-risk group.

01:43:43.769 --> 01:43:46.813
So you probably got it
from a contaminated needle.

01:43:48.013 --> 01:43:50.014
How do I get rid of it?

01:44:11.150 --> 01:44:13.847
But how do they know?
They don't know anything about it.

01:44:13.977 --> 01:44:16.022
They know, okay?

01:44:16.152 --> 01:44:18.152
They just know.

01:45:15.473 --> 01:45:18.083
You know what I think?

01:45:18.213 --> 01:45:21.649
I think there's a reason
for everything.

01:45:21.735 --> 01:45:25.606
And I think that there's
a plan for everybody.

01:45:27.224 --> 01:45:30.181
And I think that God...

01:45:30.269 --> 01:45:33.312
has a big plan for me.

01:45:34.279 --> 01:45:36.497
Just not in this life.

01:45:39.933 --> 01:45:42.498
I'm on top of everything.

01:45:42.585 --> 01:45:44.585
I'm super cool.

01:45:46.891 --> 01:45:49.022
Ah, you've gotten better.

01:45:54.737 --> 01:45:56.258
I can't take her home.

01:45:57.259 --> 01:46:00.433
I'm trying, but Henry
is just afraid.

01:46:01.391 --> 01:46:03.434
So what?

01:46:03.522 --> 01:46:05.305
Dr. Blair-

01:46:05.391 --> 01:46:08.306
This is your daughter.
Your daughter.

01:46:08.392 --> 01:46:11.306
So people are scared.
I am scared.

01:46:11.437 --> 01:46:14.916
He's afraid that if people find out,
he could lose his job.

01:46:18.239 --> 01:46:20.240
Fine. Okay, fine.

01:46:23.675 --> 01:46:25.763
And where is she going to go?

01:46:25.893 --> 01:46:29.981
He wants her to go to a hotel.
He says that he'll pay for it.

01:46:32.112 --> 01:46:34.113
Oh, God, listen to me.

01:46:40.914 --> 01:46:42.872
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

01:46:55.597 --> 01:46:57.902
What about her father?
Why can't he take her?

01:46:58.033 --> 01:47:00.425
She doesn't want him to know.

01:47:03.251 --> 01:47:05.904
I don't want to lose my baby.

01:47:11.079 --> 01:47:14.080
- Kathleen-
- No, I can't.

01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:26.719
Well...

01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:29.024
you have to understand.

01:47:29.111 --> 01:47:31.112
In those days...

01:47:32.807 --> 01:47:34.590
nobody knew.

01:47:42.324 --> 01:47:44.107
People were scared.

01:47:44.411 --> 01:47:46.194
I was scared.

01:47:49.021 --> 01:47:51.718
She must have been scared too.

01:48:05.130 --> 01:48:09.131
Dear Linda,
this is the end of my book.

01:48:09.217 --> 01:48:12.306
The last page, the last shot.

01:48:12.392 --> 01:48:15.002
Seeing you to say hello
and good-bye.

01:48:15.828 --> 01:48:18.568
Seeing you to fill up
all the empty...

01:48:18.699 --> 01:48:21.525
and smell and touch...

01:48:21.656 --> 01:48:23.743
and leave my kisses
all over your face.

01:48:28.893 --> 01:48:31.590
- That's me.
- Come in.

01:48:38.199 --> 01:48:40.200
Do you want some tea?

01:48:41.157 --> 01:48:44.592
I was so nervous
about seeing you.

01:48:44.636 --> 01:48:46.680
Coffee?

01:48:46.724 --> 01:48:48.941
No, I can't stay long.

01:48:49.698 --> 01:48:50.960
Why not?

01:48:54.482 --> 01:48:56.353
I have an appointment.

01:48:57.614 --> 01:48:59.397
Work?

01:49:01.093 --> 01:49:02.963
No more work for me.

01:49:04.746 --> 01:49:07.312
I just thought
we'd have more time.

01:49:07.442 --> 01:49:09.530
Yeah, me too.

01:49:09.791 --> 01:49:11.226
Just not today.

01:49:11.313 --> 01:49:13.183
That's okay.

01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:16.793
We have all the time in the world.
We'll take it.

01:49:18.184 --> 01:49:19.620
Yeah, I guess so.

01:49:21.203 --> 01:49:24.334
But today I just wanted
to see your face.

01:49:24.464 --> 01:49:26.205
I missed your face.

01:49:40.339 --> 01:49:42.340
What are you going to do?

01:49:45.453 --> 01:49:48.019
I don't know. I have some plans.
I think...

01:49:48.150 --> 01:49:50.585
I might go to school, you know?

01:49:50.672 --> 01:49:52.891
Learn something useful maybe.

01:49:54.847 --> 01:49:58.110
Maybe even settle down
and have some kids, you know?

01:49:58.240 --> 01:50:00.023
What the hell?

01:50:00.066 --> 01:50:01.632
Wow.

01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:05.068
How straight are you now?

01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:08.199
I mean, are we
talking about men?

01:50:09.503 --> 01:50:11.504
You don't need a husband
to have kids.

01:50:14.896 --> 01:50:19.419
And besides, you were the one
who always had my heart, you know?

01:50:24.055 --> 01:50:27.796
Yeah, I guess I did know that.

01:50:33.676 --> 01:50:35.807
Would you keep these for me?

01:50:38.373 --> 01:50:40.330
Your fairy tales?

01:50:40.460 --> 01:50:42.548
Yeah, some. A few.

01:50:43.940 --> 01:50:47.027
Plus all the other
crazy shit in my head.

01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:52.941
I don't want to throw it away.
I just don't want it around right now.

01:50:54.464 --> 01:50:57.551
- You can read it if you want.
- No, I won't.

01:50:57.683 --> 01:51:01.770
No, read it.
I want you to, you know?

01:51:01.858 --> 01:51:04.380
Maybe you can make
some sense out of it.

01:51:04.467 --> 01:51:06.163
I never could.

01:51:11.878 --> 01:51:15.444
- I'm gonna see you again, aren't I?
- Yeah, you want to?

01:51:25.629 --> 01:51:30.544
You know, I was thinking about...

01:51:31.674 --> 01:51:34.937
getting a house at the beach
this summer.

01:51:35.067 --> 01:51:36.502
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:51:36.588 --> 01:51:40.198
I really thought that
it would give us a chance.

01:51:41.329 --> 01:51:45.070
I would like so much for us
to have another chance.

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:50.202
Yeah, I'd like that too.

01:51:55.647 --> 01:51:56.995
I gotta go.

01:51:57.256 --> 01:52:00.039
No, wait.
I want you to stay.

01:52:12.817 --> 01:52:17.253
You were the one.
You were the only one.

01:52:17.339 --> 01:52:20.428
And you are amazing.

01:52:34.292 --> 01:52:36.162
She-

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:39.380
She put together this money.

01:52:40.512 --> 01:52:42.599
She pawned some things...

01:52:42.686 --> 01:52:45.208
borrowed some from her father...

01:52:46.026 --> 01:52:48.723
stole some from Kathleen.

01:52:51.514 --> 01:52:55.689
I didn't know
what she was doing.

01:52:55.777 --> 01:52:57.821
I should have...

01:52:57.951 --> 01:52:59.691
but I didn't.

01:52:59.778 --> 01:53:02.822
It may have crossed my mind.

01:53:04.431 --> 01:53:06.475
I really didn't think
she would do that.

01:53:09.085 --> 01:53:11.303
I really didn't.

01:53:13.756 --> 01:53:16.495
Yo, Gia. How you doing?

01:53:16.626 --> 01:53:18.192
Good. Is he here?

01:53:18.322 --> 01:53:20.236
Yeah, he's in the back.

01:53:26.412 --> 01:53:28.629
How much you want, angel?

01:53:28.672 --> 01:53:31.108
As much as you've got.

01:53:34.074 --> 01:53:37.250
What are you gonna do
with that much stuff?

01:53:38.424 --> 01:53:40.772
Well, that's my business.

01:53:45.139 --> 01:53:48.400
- What, are you holding or not?
- What's your hurry?

01:53:49.488 --> 01:53:51.488
All right. Come on.
Yes or no?

01:53:52.924 --> 01:53:55.576
Yeah, I got what you need...

01:53:55.663 --> 01:53:57.664
and I got it right here.

01:53:58.447 --> 01:54:00.839
Yo, man, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:54:00.925 --> 01:54:04.057
- Look what Santa Claus brought us.
- I'm freaking out of here!

01:54:04.187 --> 01:54:06.666
You get the money.
I'm gonna get mine.

01:54:26.802 --> 01:54:28.759
It's gonna be all right.

01:54:51.896 --> 01:54:53.940
What are you doing here?

01:55:10.753 --> 01:55:13.711
I'm gonna take you home, baby.

01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:22.495
She wouldn't let anybody see her...

01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:24.845
but I went anyway.

01:55:24.975 --> 01:55:27.410
I saw her once.

01:55:28.541 --> 01:55:30.541
But I did see her.

01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:34.716
- I don't think she knew it was me.
- No more than five minutes, okay?

01:55:35.909 --> 01:55:40.561
I couldn't help thinking to myself,
"My God, she's just a kid."

01:55:41.693 --> 01:55:44.127
I blame myself, you know?

01:55:45.433 --> 01:55:48.434
I mean, these are children.

01:55:49.686 --> 01:55:52.383
No matter how screwed up
our lives may be...

01:55:52.687 --> 01:55:55.558
we've got to take care
of our children.

01:56:09.057 --> 01:56:11.188
She knew she was dying.

01:56:11.449 --> 01:56:13.841
She said she wanted
to do it right.

01:56:13.971 --> 01:56:16.711
She wanted
to get a video camera...

01:56:16.799 --> 01:56:18.929
and do this thing...

01:56:19.017 --> 01:56:21.974
where she talked to kids
about drugs.

01:56:23.017 --> 01:56:25.017
She wanted to tell kids...

01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:28.280
that you can handle it.

01:56:29.732 --> 01:56:31.994
You can handle anything
that comes your way.

01:56:34.647 --> 01:56:37.039
But we never got the camera.

01:56:47.442 --> 01:56:51.791
You do be the prettiest,
prettiest girl.

01:56:52.921 --> 01:56:54.922
You do be that.

01:56:55.878 --> 01:56:57.487
Do I?

01:56:58.444 --> 01:57:02.011
Do I be the prettiest?

01:57:17.642 --> 01:57:19.946
Do you forgive me, Kathleen?

01:57:23.522 --> 01:57:25.217
Oh, honey.

01:57:27.305 --> 01:57:28.566
Oh, yeah.

01:57:33.959 --> 01:57:35.698
Of course I do.

01:57:41.492 --> 01:57:44.014
Because I forgive you too.

01:57:48.493 --> 01:57:50.277
Oh, baby.

01:58:00.810 --> 01:58:02.549
What's this?

01:58:08.029 --> 01:58:09.986
What is it?

01:58:10.073 --> 01:58:11.987
Oh, my God.

01:58:14.344 --> 01:58:16.215
Nurse?

01:58:16.302 --> 01:58:18.433
Where are you going, Mom?

01:58:19.911 --> 01:58:21.651
Mom?

01:58:22.825 --> 01:58:24.826
Where you going?

01:58:31.192 --> 01:58:34.324
She died around
10:00 in the morning.

01:58:34.542 --> 01:58:36.934
They tried to pick her-

01:58:37.064 --> 01:58:40.109
They tried to pick her
up off the bed, and she-

01:58:40.195 --> 01:58:43.066
The flesh just fell off her back.
It just fell off.

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:46.241
You don't want
to hear about that.

01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:50.633
Okay, what else?

01:58:59.435 --> 01:59:02.567
This is it.
This is what I was looking for.

01:59:04.567 --> 01:59:07.046
"And the people said...

01:59:07.307 --> 01:59:10.091
'Oh, she's not beautiful at all. '

01:59:10.177 --> 01:59:12.525
And they took her from
the beautiful house...

01:59:12.787 --> 01:59:15.440
and they drove her
into the street.

01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:18.267
And she went away...

01:59:18.397 --> 01:59:20.572
and she never came back.

01:59:23.373 --> 01:59:25.982
And soon,
people became hungry again...

01:59:26.069 --> 01:59:28.548
and they went back into
the beautiful house...

01:59:28.983 --> 01:59:32.723
looking for gold,
but there was no one there."

01:59:34.367 --> 01:59:36.194
They say she knew.

01:59:36.324 --> 01:59:38.716
She really knew.
She knew the whole story.

01:59:42.326 --> 01:59:45.370
We found an undertaker,
and it was hard, believe me.

01:59:45.500 --> 01:59:48.719
You know, because of the AIDS.

01:59:48.849 --> 01:59:51.936
I didn't want people
to remember her like that...

01:59:51.937 --> 01:59:53.897
because I didn't want people
to see her like that.

01:59:54.024 --> 01:59:57.939
I wanted them to remember her
as beautiful...

01:59:58.025 --> 02:00:01.070
because that's what
she really was.

02:00:41.795 --> 02:00:44.143
Life and death...

02:00:44.230 --> 02:00:47.056
energy and peace.

02:00:47.188 --> 02:00:50.319
If I stop today,
it was still worth it.

02:00:50.406 --> 02:00:53.189
Even the terrible mistakes
that I have made...

02:00:53.319 --> 02:00:55.755
and would have unmade
if I could.

02:00:55.885 --> 02:00:59.539
The pains that have burned me
and scarred my soul.

02:00:59.669 --> 02:01:01.061
It was worth it...

02:01:01.148 --> 02:01:04.192
for having been allowed
to walk where I've walked...

02:01:04.279 --> 02:01:06.366
which was to hell on Earth...

02:01:06.497 --> 02:01:08.454
heaven on Earth...

02:01:08.498 --> 02:01:11.455
back again, into, under...

02:01:11.541 --> 02:01:14.498
far in between, through it...

02:01:14.586 --> 02:01:16.804
in it and above.
