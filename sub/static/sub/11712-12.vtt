18:55.176 --> 18:56.260
to be sent up to your suite?

18:56.260 --> 18:58.137
Sure. How about
some caviar?

18:58.137 --> 19:00.389
Great.
And some lobster.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.473
And an in-room massage.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.142
Oh, and some flowers.
And a shoe shine.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.561
Actually, we have
a complimentary shoe shine.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.020
Then I don't want it.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.564
Just more caviar.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.690
All right. Excellent.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.568
And Vincent will show you
to your suite.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.235
Great.

I can't wait to see the view.

19:16.112 --> 19:18.324
I can't wait
to shovel down some caviar.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.826
I am loving this.
Not as much as me.

19:20.826 --> 19:21.827
Club level, Vincent.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.887
All right, tell me honestly,

19:40.887 --> 19:41.555
if I hadn't stop us,

19:41.555 --> 19:43.432
would you have gone
through with it?

19:43.432 --> 19:45.100
I would have gone all the way.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.017
Really?

19:46.017 --> 19:47.394
All the way to our suite,

19:47.394 --> 19:49.730
and then I would have
faked a heart attack.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.193
Oh, we have a message.

MAN:
Hey, sweetheart, it's your dad.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.822
Just wanted you to know we
returned that fancy computer.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.991
We'll be sending you
the money back.

20:00.991 --> 20:03.619
Okay, my minute's
almost up, gotta go.

[BEEPS]

20:04.953 --> 20:07.373
Well, he returned it.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.874
No surprise there.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.001
Well, look, your dad
is a good man.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.378
He and your mom sacrificed

20:12.378 --> 20:14.588
so that you could have
nice things,

20:14.588 --> 20:15.922
go to college.

20:15.922 --> 20:18.091
And meet me.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.760
[CHUCKLES]
I know.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.262
And the part of the reason
I love you

20:21.262 --> 20:23.222
is because you're
a little like him.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.890
Maybe a little bit.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.558
And, hey, since he returned
the laptop,

20:26.558 --> 20:28.602
we got another check
coming our way.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.520
More house money.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.146
Yeah, maybe this time

20:31.146 --> 20:33.106
we should put it
somewhere safe.

20:33.106 --> 20:34.483
Agreed.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.318
I'll go get the glue stick.
