WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:03.804
MAN:
Whoo-hoo!

00:03.837 --> 00:06.140
VA Beach, here we come!

00:06.174 --> 00:07.675
Now you're sure this girl
has a friend, Westfall?

00:07.708 --> 00:09.410
Would I lie to you?

00:09.443 --> 00:11.745
In a heartbeat.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.514
You know what?
That hurts.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.416
Yes, she has a friend.
Yeah?

00:15.449 --> 00:16.117
What's she look like?

00:16.150 --> 00:17.818
Karen says she's very blonde.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.353
Mentally or physically?

00:19.387 --> 00:20.788
Look, we're out
to have fun.

00:20.821 --> 00:24.325
Right.
So, how dumb is she?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.426
Uh, 38DD.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.128
( both chuckling )

00:27.161 --> 00:29.830
( music blaring )

00:29.863 --> 00:31.632
( tires screeching )

00:33.734 --> 00:35.603
( siren blaring )

00:35.636 --> 00:37.338
Oh, damn it.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.640
How fast were you going?

00:39.673 --> 00:42.176
Seventy-five.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.678
That's what you get
for screwing a buddy over.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.082
Hey, pull out
your military I.D.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.150
Maybe he'll let us slide

00:49.183 --> 00:50.518
with a warning.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.159
Sorry about that, Officer.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.727
My friend and I
were on our way to...

01:02.196 --> 01:03.397
( grunting )

01:11.805 --> 01:15.776
Captioning sponsored by
PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:15.809 --> 01:20.448
and CBS

01:54.915 --> 01:56.750
McGEE:
Is that Tony?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.688
No.

02:00.721 --> 02:02.423
Well, you sure?
It really looked like...

02:02.456 --> 02:03.591
Is there a reason

02:03.624 --> 02:05.159
you've been haunting my desk
all week?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.827
Uh, no, I was just...

02:06.860 --> 02:08.796
Or maybe you
just decided

02:08.829 --> 02:10.864
to take over DiNozzo's job
of annoying me

02:10.898 --> 02:12.500
while he's on sick leave.

02:12.533 --> 02:14.902
I-I just wanted to check
that everything was okay.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.870
Why wouldn't it be?

02:16.904 --> 02:20.208
Well, you and
Tony were close,

02:20.241 --> 02:21.609
and... you know.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.377
No, I don't know.

02:23.411 --> 02:24.945
What?

02:24.978 --> 02:26.714
He almost died.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.716
We're NCIS agents, McGee.

02:28.749 --> 02:30.618
There is a chance
one of us might die

02:30.651 --> 02:33.521
every time we walk
through the door.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.788
Yeah, but I'm

02:34.822 --> 02:36.657
the idiot
that handed him an envelope

02:36.690 --> 02:37.891
filled with plague.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.727
Tim...

02:39.760 --> 02:42.330
it's not your fault.

02:42.363 --> 02:44.332
Look, if you want to
think about something,

02:44.365 --> 02:45.599
why don't you
think about

02:45.633 --> 02:47.801
all the times
Tony has insulted us,

02:47.835 --> 02:49.337
invaded our privacy.

02:49.370 --> 02:52.606
The fact he almost died
owing us all money.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.308
That's true--
he can be pretty obnoxious.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.409
Uh-huh.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.478
( phone ringing )

03:00.348 --> 03:02.316
You miss him as
much as I do?

03:02.350 --> 03:04.352
More.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.421
It's part of his charm.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.290
He's like an X-rated Peter Pan.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.395
You know he told
all the girls downstairs

03:14.428 --> 03:16.497
you're gay, right?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.233
Said it would cut down
on the competition.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.736
That bastard.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.472
Hold onto that feeling,

03:24.505 --> 03:26.940
and you're going
to be just fine.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.742
You want to know
what he said about you?

03:28.776 --> 03:30.778
Hmm.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.346
That you tried to sleep with him

03:32.380 --> 03:33.547
when you were in Paraguay.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.950
I will kill him.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.552
You're sure you're
up for this?

03:38.586 --> 03:39.587
Never felt better.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.954
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.690
You look like crap.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.326
I missed you too, boss.

03:45.359 --> 03:47.561
You've got another week
of sick leave coming, Tony.

03:47.595 --> 03:48.762
You should take it.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.399
I was going crazy at home.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.668
Maybe I'm not 100%,
but you need me.

03:54.702 --> 03:58.639
Okay,
what about Kate and McGee?

03:58.672 --> 04:00.574
They're practically lost
without me.

04:00.608 --> 04:04.412
They've gotten more work
done in the last two weeks

04:04.445 --> 04:05.979
than they have all year.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.715
But they did miss me,
right?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.049
Yeah, something like that.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.984
I can't wait to
see their faces.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.553
( silly,
diabolical chuckle )

04:12.586 --> 04:13.754
KATE:
You did the right thing.

04:13.787 --> 04:14.755
Where is the
car, exactly?

04:14.788 --> 04:15.923
Hi, Kate!

04:15.956 --> 04:17.057
( stifled cough )

04:17.090 --> 04:18.326
Sorry about that, Captain.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.527
Where'd you say the car was?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.962
Must be important.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.597
Probie, did you miss me?

04:23.631 --> 04:24.765
Long time no...

04:24.798 --> 04:26.500
Thank you, Captain.
What's wrong with him?

04:26.534 --> 04:27.601
Virginia State Police

04:27.635 --> 04:28.969
just got a 911 call, Gibbs.

04:29.002 --> 04:29.970
Two dead sailors.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.972
Where?
In a car off Route 17

04:32.005 --> 04:33.040
in Fredericksburg.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.375
GIBBS:
Let's roll.

04:34.408 --> 04:36.544
Gas the truck.
Sure th...

04:36.577 --> 04:38.579
McGEE:
On it, boss.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.914
Maybe I did die.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.283
You feel that?
Feel what?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.787
Oh. You're still alive.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.557
Welcome back, DiNozzo.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.692
( police radio chatter )

04:51.725 --> 04:52.993
Two victims.

04:53.026 --> 04:55.796
KATE:
Looks like the shooter
knew what he was doing, Gibbs.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.832
Tight groupings,

04:58.866 --> 05:00.901
three rounds each.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.570
GIBBS:
Every one of them a kill shot.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.709
Passenger's
Curtis Janssen,

05:08.742 --> 05:11.011
Pensacola, Florida.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.846
No military I.D.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.583
Credit cards and
money are intact.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.651
So, it wasn't a robbery?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.019
Depends.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.454
On what?

05:20.488 --> 05:21.789
On what else
is missing, Kate.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.726
Looks like the killer
tried to clean up.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.729
GIBBS:
Not exactly.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.531
( gasping )

05:34.802 --> 05:35.936
You know

05:35.969 --> 05:37.638
he took at least
two things with him

05:37.671 --> 05:38.639
when he left.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.441
KATE:
He needed his prints?

05:40.474 --> 05:41.842
Bag it.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.945
TONY:
Boss! State cops ran
the Mustang's plates.

05:44.978 --> 05:47.448
It's a rental car out of

05:47.481 --> 05:48.749
Dulles Airport.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.117
I got a call into this...

05:51.985 --> 05:54.688
( grunting and yelling )

05:54.722 --> 05:56.690
Ow.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.459
Are you okay?

05:58.492 --> 06:00.628
Just trying to catch my breath.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.696
You should have taken
that extra week off, DiNozzo.

06:02.730 --> 06:03.497
Help him up, Kate.

06:03.531 --> 06:05.866
I'm gonna see
what's keeping Ducky.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.134
KATE:
Did that hurt?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.069
Yup.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.604
( shutter clicks )

06:10.638 --> 06:11.805
Good.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.874
( soft, pitiful grunt )

06:13.907 --> 06:16.009
Where the hell
are they, McGee?

06:16.043 --> 06:18.846
Palmer must have taken
a wrong turn again, boss.

06:20.748 --> 06:23.484
DUCKY:
I was facing the rear...

06:23.517 --> 06:24.652
( tires screech )

06:24.685 --> 06:26.654
JIMMY:
Doctor, I just turned
the way you said.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.689
DUCKY:
You should have known
"right" meant "left."

06:28.722 --> 06:29.790
I'm terribly sorry,
Jethro.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.694
Mr. Palmer
got us lost again.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.695
Doctor, you had the map.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.797
You gave it to me!

06:36.830 --> 06:39.667
Sir, for the
record, I-I...

06:39.700 --> 06:41.602
Looks like a
professional hit.

06:41.635 --> 06:44.538
Probably took the hands
to confirm the kill.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.740
McGee told me what you said.

06:46.774 --> 06:50.744
Did he, now?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.546
Oh, come on.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.615
I was joking around.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.617
I didn't think he'd
really believe me.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.785
Really? And why is that?

06:57.818 --> 07:00.087
Anyone looking at you can
tell your breasts are real.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.591
Wha... you told him
I had breast implants?!

07:05.559 --> 07:06.827
( sheepish chuckle ):
No.

07:06.860 --> 07:07.761
You know what, Tony?

07:07.795 --> 07:10.030
I can't even believe
I worried about you.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.799
You are nothing but a...
Snake.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.000
Yeah, exactly.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.135
No, a big-big-big-big snake,

07:15.168 --> 07:17.738
down there.
( gasping )

07:17.771 --> 07:19.172
( panting )

07:19.206 --> 07:22.075
Tell me it's not poisonous.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.844
I think it is.

07:23.877 --> 07:26.847
( whimpering )

07:26.880 --> 07:28.982
Ew! What is it doing?!

07:29.016 --> 07:31.919
It's wrapping
around your leg.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.554
( whimpering )

07:33.587 --> 07:34.955
Do something, Tony.
Okay.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.156
I'll try and grab it.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.659
Just don't make
any sudden moves, all right?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.661
KATE:
Ah! What if you miss it?

07:40.694 --> 07:42.863
TONY:
They do this stuff
on the Discovery Channel

07:42.896 --> 07:43.964
all the time.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.265
How hard can it be?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.834
Oh, no, screw it;
I'm going to shoot it.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.035
TONY:
Hey!

07:48.068 --> 07:50.704
Put that gun away.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.972
You're going
to blow your foot off.

07:52.005 --> 07:53.173
Let me do this.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.076
God. My life in your hands?

07:56.109 --> 07:58.712
I knew it was going
to end this way.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.047
Quiet. You're
making me nervous.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.248
( whimpering )

08:01.281 --> 08:02.583
Easy now.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.817
About there...

08:03.851 --> 08:06.053
( whimpering louder )

08:06.086 --> 08:08.556
Ah. Okay.
Get it off!

08:08.589 --> 08:09.757
Oh, God.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.058
Gotcha!

08:11.091 --> 08:13.126
( laughs softly )

08:13.160 --> 08:14.562
Okay, I'll give
you this much.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.629
You do have
your moments.

08:15.663 --> 08:16.797
Hee-hee-hee.

08:16.830 --> 08:20.200
So, are we friends again?

08:20.233 --> 08:21.669
Oh, cool, a corn snake.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.770
Can I hold him?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.805
No, it's poisonous, McGee.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.674
No, actually
they're-they're not, Kate.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.676
Yes, they are, McGee.
What about that one

08:28.709 --> 08:30.010
you caught in
Shenandoah State Park?

08:30.043 --> 08:32.112
You had it around your neck
for, like, an hour.

08:33.981 --> 08:37.585
That near-fatal illness
may have clouded my memory.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.787
( grunting )

08:39.820 --> 08:41.755
You're such a loser.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.891
All right, get back to work.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.126
McGee,
check the trunk.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.962
Nobody touch the dead bodies
until Ducky says all clear.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.732
All right.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.969
Freeze, McGee; don't move!

08:56.003 --> 08:57.671
( high-pitched beeping )

08:59.339 --> 09:01.074
TONY:
The car's wired
to explode.

09:01.108 --> 09:04.311
It looks like the detonator's
tied to the trunk.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.979
What?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.981
How far did
you turn the key?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.049
Uh, I'm not sure.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.050
Almost all the way,
I think.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.151
Okay, don't let
it snap back.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.886
All right?
Yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:13.854
Let go.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.956
Okay.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.893
Okay, both of you run.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.762
No, Tony, we're not
leaving you standing...

09:21.795 --> 09:23.196
I'm a lot faster than you are.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.798
I'll be right behind you.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.934
This is not
a debate, okay?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.836
This thing
might be primed already.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.307
Anthony, you should have taken
that extra week.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.849
It's the car!
It's wired to ex...!

09:51.859 --> 09:53.661
Tony!

09:59.399 --> 10:01.368
Boss...

10:01.401 --> 10:03.837
you remember when I said
I never felt better?

10:03.871 --> 10:06.306
I lied.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.649
I'm telling you I'm fine.

10:15.683 --> 10:19.386
136/84 is not fine
for you, Tony.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.321
Your blood
pressure is high.

10:21.354 --> 10:23.356
Almost getting blown up
tends to do that to me,

10:23.390 --> 10:27.260
not to mention
hanging around Kate

10:27.294 --> 10:29.129
when she's in one of her moods.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.099
This isn't funny,
DiNozzo.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.400
No, it's not.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.102
If I didn't come
in to work today,

10:35.135 --> 10:37.270
you and McGee'd be lying on one
of those tables over there.

10:37.304 --> 10:40.708
At least your temperature
is pretty normal.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.275
Yeah, I'm good to go.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.212
( groans )
Oh, muscle soreness?

10:45.245 --> 10:47.114
Only when I move
or breathe.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.115
Yes, clearly,

10:48.148 --> 10:49.116
you haven't
quite recovered

10:49.149 --> 10:50.283
from your bout
with Y. pestis.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.284
You need a rest.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.753
No, I need to get

10:52.786 --> 10:53.754
back to work, Ducky.

10:53.787 --> 10:55.155
Damn it, Tony.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.424
I should just take you home
and get you in bed.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.029
Okay, that didn't come
out the way I intended.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.697
What didn't, Kate?

11:03.731 --> 11:04.932
Oh, I-I was
just saying...

11:04.965 --> 11:05.766
Kate was just, uh,

11:05.799 --> 11:08.101
expressing our concern
for Tony, here.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.102
Yeah?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.437
How is he?

11:10.470 --> 11:11.805
Stubborn, pigheaded,
and unaware

11:11.839 --> 11:12.806
of his own limitations.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.708
Sounds about right.

11:14.742 --> 11:15.843
I haven't finished
with you yet.

11:15.876 --> 11:16.844
Got a positive I.D.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.278
here yet, Duck?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.346
You want to buy
me dinner first,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.080
or should we go to
your... ( grunts )

11:20.113 --> 11:22.282
Fortunately, the
skulls remained

11:22.315 --> 11:24.151
relatively intact.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.720
JIMMY:
The problem is sorting out
which parts belong with whom.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.355
Yeah, I can see
that, Palmer.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.123
The dental records

11:30.157 --> 11:31.158
were conclusive.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.060
Passengers were Navy lieutenants

11:33.093 --> 11:35.028
Dean Westfall
and Curtis Janssen.

11:35.062 --> 11:35.863
TONY:
Well, that checks.

11:35.896 --> 11:36.830
According to the
car rental place,

11:36.864 --> 11:39.299
Westfall rented a
Mustang two months ago.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.068
GIBBS:
Kate, pull up their
service records.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.069
Have McGee find out

11:42.102 --> 11:43.170
who made that 911 call.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.504
KATE:
On it.
Tony.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.505
Yeah?

11:45.538 --> 11:48.942
Go lie down
before you pass out.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.914
I'm not going to pass out.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.249
I might cry a little,

11:56.283 --> 11:58.218
maybe feel sorry for myself,

11:58.251 --> 12:00.921
but DiNozzos do not pass out.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.222
Coming, boss.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.057
Can't you
do something, Duck?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.292
Yes, well,
I'm doing it right now.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.060
What?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.428
Praying.
( scoffs )

12:08.461 --> 12:10.363
You going to be okay?

12:10.397 --> 12:12.966
TONY:
Sure.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.334
Not looking so hot.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.236
Well, at least
that's an improvement.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.137
Over what?

12:17.170 --> 12:19.272
According to Gibbs,
I look like crap.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.308
You know, Kate--

12:21.341 --> 12:22.542
really been
worried about you.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.544
Kate worries
about everything.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.946
No, no, no, I mean,

12:25.979 --> 12:26.947
really worried.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.315
What's your point, probie?

12:28.348 --> 12:32.219
Well, you think that maybe...
you know.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.855
( chuckling ):
Me and Kate?

12:34.888 --> 12:36.556
Never happen.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.557
Why not?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.793
She's too smart for that.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.562
You know what?
You don't believe me?

12:42.595 --> 12:44.464
She's coming right now. Shh.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.533
Gibbs wants to know who made
that 911 call this morning, Tim.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.368
On it.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.269
Where's DiNozzo?

12:49.302 --> 12:52.205
Uh, I think he's
laying down somewhere.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.074
Oh, good. He needs it.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.342
You care a lot about
him, don't you, Kate?

12:58.045 --> 12:59.880
Well, he's my teammate.

12:59.913 --> 13:00.747
What do you think?

13:00.780 --> 13:02.249
McGEE:
I don't know,
sometimes I think

13:02.282 --> 13:04.051
it might be more than that.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.418
( chuckles ):
Tony?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.386
Are you kidding?

13:06.419 --> 13:08.021
Well, come on,
you never thought about it?

13:10.157 --> 13:12.292
Well...

13:12.325 --> 13:14.361
I guess there are times

13:14.394 --> 13:17.297
when Tony
can be charming, warm,

13:17.330 --> 13:19.566
not completely obnoxious.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.302
Right. So if he wasn't
your teammate?

13:22.335 --> 13:23.603
Ooh, that's a tough one.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.906
Well, on the plus side,
he is...

13:25.939 --> 13:27.941
smart, brave,

13:27.975 --> 13:30.277
not to mention...
kind of hot.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.211
Hey, you know, in
a different world,

13:31.244 --> 13:34.181
I could see myself
marrying someone like him.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.215
Hmm.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.084
( shouts )

13:41.488 --> 13:42.622
Very funny.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.557
GIBBS:
Hey.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.993
I thought I told
you to lie down.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.027
I was.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.964
I am.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.332
Not here.

13:59.039 --> 14:00.473
( snarls )

14:15.355 --> 14:18.926
Well, hey, there,
little lady.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.928
Tony! You're back!

14:20.961 --> 14:23.063
I missed you!

14:23.096 --> 14:24.197
Oh! Oh, oh...

14:24.231 --> 14:25.498
Oh, what's wrong?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.367
Did I hurt you?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.669
I'm fine.
Just a little sore,

14:29.702 --> 14:32.205
you know,
from the explosion and all.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.440
I'm sorry.

14:33.473 --> 14:34.441
Do you want to sit down?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.675
Well, I was kind
of thinking

14:35.708 --> 14:37.410
about lying down
next to your

14:37.444 --> 14:39.679
little refrigerator
thingy over here.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.381
Sure, sure.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.583
Oh, yes.
Here.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.186
You can use Bert as a pillow.

14:48.155 --> 14:49.156
( farting sound )

14:51.224 --> 14:53.160
He's supposed to make
that noise.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.028
You have a stuffed animal
that farts?

14:55.062 --> 14:58.365
Yeah. It's cool, huh?

14:58.398 --> 15:00.533
Yeah... in a disturbing way.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.669
So, what did I miss?
( farting sound )

15:02.702 --> 15:04.404
Gibbs has been cranky
since you've been gone.

15:04.437 --> 15:05.405
Think his knee's
bothering him.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.240
And, uh, Kate broke up
with some lawyer guy,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.076
which is really good,
'cause he wasn't very big

15:09.109 --> 15:12.145
on personal hygiene,
and...
About the case, Abbs.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.014
I got a glimpse
of the bomb.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.715
It was definitely
a pro job.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.717
You are correct, sir.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.253
I've run ten samples.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.454
The main electric charge is C-4.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.023
It's primed with det cord

15:23.056 --> 15:23.890
and blasting caps.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.558
So we should be able
to trace its source

15:25.592 --> 15:27.427
to the manufacturer.
( farting sound )

15:27.460 --> 15:28.495
You'd think so,
but no.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.497
Abby, every military explosive

15:30.530 --> 15:32.199
over the last 20 years

15:32.232 --> 15:34.101
has had taggants
mixed in

15:34.134 --> 15:36.236
for identification
purposes.
Yep,

15:36.269 --> 15:38.338
but these don't.
You telling me

15:38.371 --> 15:40.073
this guy made this stuff
from scratch?

15:40.107 --> 15:41.274
Mm-mm.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.476
The compositions
are exact as off the shelf.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.412
That's not possible.
How's that possible?

15:45.445 --> 15:46.446
It shouldn't
be possible.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.248
Oh, it's possible.
( farting sound )

15:48.281 --> 15:50.450
That was the stuffed
animal, boss.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.618
( farting sound )
Right, Abby?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.286
What stuffed animal?

15:53.320 --> 15:54.487
Abbs...

15:54.521 --> 15:56.556
are you sure
these explosives
( farting sound )

15:56.589 --> 15:57.557
aren't traceable?

15:57.590 --> 15:58.591
Um, so far,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.560
but I'm still checking.
What about the detonator?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.762
Also weird.
The electronics

16:02.795 --> 16:03.663
are fairly simple,

16:03.696 --> 16:06.233
but there's no serial numbers
on anything.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.434
It's like it's been sanitized.
( farting sounds )

16:07.467 --> 16:08.768
Let's go, DiNozzo.
We got problems.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.338
Someone's trying
to kill us again.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.706
I don't think
he meant that literally.

16:14.741 --> 16:17.510
( farting sound )

16:17.544 --> 16:19.612
Okay, thanks, Sergeant.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.349
We'll, uh, still need a
copy of the dispatch tape.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.416
Boss, uh, according

16:23.450 --> 16:26.153
to State Police,
the 911 call was...
Anonymous?

16:26.186 --> 16:28.755
Yes, and it was also...

16:28.788 --> 16:31.024
Untraceable.
McGEE:
Yeah.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.792
Uh, they're sending a tape
with the call over.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.661
GIBBS:
Kate, what do you know
about the lieutenants?

16:34.694 --> 16:37.564
They're both pilots, Gibbs.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.168
Lieutenant Curtis Janssen's
an instructor in Pensacola.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.535
What's he doing
in Virginia?

16:42.569 --> 16:43.336
According to his unit,

16:43.370 --> 16:45.672
he was on leave
visiting his friend,

16:45.705 --> 16:47.307
Lieutenant Dean Westfall.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.541
Also out of Pensacola,

16:48.575 --> 16:50.377
but for the last two months,
he's been T.A.D.

16:50.410 --> 16:52.712
at the Aberdeen Proving Ground
in Maryland.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.813
Proving ground?

16:53.846 --> 16:54.814
It's where they test

16:54.847 --> 16:57.517
new military equipment
and technology, probie.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.819
Maybe they used Westfall's
prints to access the base.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.687
KATE:
I checked, Tony.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.722
None of Aberdeen's
security systems rely

17:02.755 --> 17:03.723
on fingerprint

17:03.756 --> 17:04.724
or palm scanners.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.259
What was he
working on there?

17:06.293 --> 17:07.494
KATE:
Classified.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.229
I will find out.

17:09.262 --> 17:11.198
So, what's going on, boss?

17:11.231 --> 17:12.465
Car didn't have
any military decals.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.600
Lieutenants
were wearing civvies.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.668
A-And the 911 caller
specifically said

17:15.702 --> 17:17.770
that it was two
dead sailors.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.739
Someone wanted NCIS
to investigate the scene.

17:19.772 --> 17:20.740
KATE:
Why?

17:20.773 --> 17:22.142
The same reason they rigged

17:22.175 --> 17:23.576
the car to explode, Kate.

17:23.610 --> 17:24.511
TONY:
We were set up.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.479
So someone really
is trying to kill us?

17:26.513 --> 17:28.481
Yeah, and they came
pretty damn close.

17:29.482 --> 17:30.683
MORROW:
You're absolutely certain

17:30.717 --> 17:32.152
about this, Jethro?

17:32.185 --> 17:33.120
Someone went
to a lot of trouble

17:33.153 --> 17:34.621
to try to get us out there
on that road today,

17:34.654 --> 17:35.622
Director.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.623
For what purpose?

17:36.656 --> 17:39.126
Unclear, but
what concerns me

17:39.159 --> 17:42.229
is the explosive used--
military, high-grade,

17:42.262 --> 17:44.597
extremely difficult to trace.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.566
Tough to get outside
of certain circles.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.868
You're not suggesting
another agency?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.137
I'm not suggesting
anything, sir.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.673
All I know is I've pissed off
a lot of people over the years.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.143
I would ask you to keep
your suspicions to yourself.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.245
Can I ask why, sir?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.247
There may be other
factors involved.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.249
Like what, sir?

18:02.282 --> 18:05.518
Currently, I'm not
at liberty to discuss it.

18:09.456 --> 18:12.259
I almost lost my entire team
out there today.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.626
If there's something
I should know...

18:13.660 --> 18:16.563
This is not open
for discussion, Agent Gibbs.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.564
Yes, sir.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.566
You're dismissed.

18:19.599 --> 18:23.136
You have a good evening, sir.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.278
Get me the director of the FBI.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.580
Yes, sir.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.248
You want some?

18:36.816 --> 18:37.817
No, thank you.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.587
Passed on free food.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.190
Maybe he is dying.

18:43.223 --> 18:44.457
Well, I haven't had

18:44.491 --> 18:46.926
much of an appetite
lately, Kate,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.896
on account of having
the pneumonic plague.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.931
Yeah, I know, Tony.
I was there.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.700
You don't have
to keep bringing it up

18:53.733 --> 18:54.901
every five minutes.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.603
It's not every day
you escape the clutches

18:56.636 --> 18:57.604
of the Black Death, Kate.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.607
It was a life-
changing experience.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.941
How so, Tony?

19:01.974 --> 19:04.644
Ask Kate-- she was there.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.646
Hey, I want to know
what Westfall was doing

19:06.679 --> 19:08.715
at Aberdeen by the
time I get back.

19:08.748 --> 19:09.916
Where you going?
GIBBS:
Out.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.184
McGee...

19:11.218 --> 19:15.188
I want other reasons why someone
would chop off his hands. Tony?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.626
Eat something.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.537
( revving engine )

19:32.372 --> 19:35.508
Why take someone's hands?
Trophies?

19:35.542 --> 19:37.510
Okay, but why leave
the other lieutenant's?

19:37.544 --> 19:39.346
If he's chopping hands off,

19:39.379 --> 19:40.680
I don't think we can expect him

19:40.713 --> 19:41.881
to be rational, McGee.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.750
We've got trouble.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.884
What was your first hint?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.719
The two dead bodies downstairs
or the explosion, McGee?

19:46.753 --> 19:49.722
No, I mean FBI trouble.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.325
KATE:
Fornell?

19:52.359 --> 19:53.526
We must be in
worse shape

19:53.560 --> 19:54.694
than we thought.
FORNELL:
Where's Gibbs?

19:54.727 --> 19:56.529
He's not here.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.265
Where is he, Agent Todd?
KATE:
He's out.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.799
Try him on his cell.
I did.

19:59.832 --> 20:00.833
He's not answering.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.235
What's going on?

20:03.836 --> 20:06.339
Ari Haswari is
back in country.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.707
You let that psycho

20:07.740 --> 20:09.742
back in the States
without telling us?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.711
He was supposed to be helping us
uncover an Al Qaeda cell

20:11.744 --> 20:12.612
in the D.C. area.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.414
What do you mean,
"supposed to," Fornell?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.882
We now think he's here

20:15.915 --> 20:17.617
for more personal reasons.

20:17.650 --> 20:20.987
He's planning on killing Gibbs.

20:43.009 --> 20:47.414
Washington is such a lovely
city this time of year.

20:47.447 --> 20:49.316
Don't you agree,
Special Agent Gibbs?

20:51.518 --> 20:55.655
Not much of
a conversationalist, are we?

20:55.688 --> 20:58.758
I am mostly waiting here, Ari.

20:58.791 --> 20:59.726
Oh, for what?

20:59.759 --> 21:02.329
A reason to shoot
you again.

21:02.362 --> 21:03.930
Someone tried
to kill my team today.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.466
I'm thinking it was you.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.700
You wound me, Gibbs.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.302
If it was me,

21:09.336 --> 21:10.870
they'd be dead already.

21:10.903 --> 21:12.739
You're still

21:12.772 --> 21:15.842
coming in with me
for questioning.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.811
Unfortunately, I've made other
arrangements for the evening.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.413
It wasn't a request.

21:20.447 --> 21:21.848
I know.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.317
That's why I took
the precaution

21:24.351 --> 21:27.720
of planting an explosive device
under one of these tables.

21:32.425 --> 21:34.093
You be a good
NCIS agent,

21:34.126 --> 21:36.496
I may even tell you where.

21:36.529 --> 21:37.730
What are you doing here?

21:37.764 --> 21:38.998
An Al Qaeda cell

21:39.031 --> 21:40.900
is planning
an attack in Washington.

21:40.933 --> 21:42.335
I'm here to stop it.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.536
Yeah?
What's the target?

21:43.570 --> 21:44.737
I don't know.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.739
Where's the cell located?

21:46.773 --> 21:47.740
Wish I knew.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.008
You're doing
a hell of a job

21:49.041 --> 21:50.877
for a Mossad double agent.

21:50.910 --> 21:51.811
I can, however,

21:51.844 --> 21:55.515
gain access to that information,

21:55.548 --> 21:56.883
but it comes at a price.

21:56.916 --> 21:57.884
One you may not

21:57.917 --> 21:59.352
be willing
to pay.

21:59.386 --> 22:01.554
Try me.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.756
Al Qaeda sent me here
to conduct my own mission.

22:03.790 --> 22:04.824
It's a test.

22:04.857 --> 22:09.462
I pass, and I'm allowed
into the Washington cell.

22:11.498 --> 22:13.566
They want me to kill you.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.369
You don't
seem surprised?

22:16.403 --> 22:17.970
It means I'm doing my job.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.039
Yes.

22:20.072 --> 22:23.576
And in order for me to do mine,
you have to die.

22:23.610 --> 22:27.880
I wonder, what would
you do in my position?

22:27.914 --> 22:30.917
Kill myself.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.885
( laughs )

22:32.919 --> 22:35.388
Sadly, not an option.

22:35.422 --> 22:38.758
It's the one part
of my religion I subscribe to.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.860
I could help you
out with that.

22:40.893 --> 22:44.697
A kind offer to be sure.

22:44.731 --> 22:47.834
I also have one for you.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.001
I'm listening.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.471
You have 24 hours

22:51.504 --> 22:53.440
to find and eliminate the cell.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.642
If you fail...

22:55.675 --> 22:58.911
I appreciate the heads-up.

22:58.945 --> 23:02.415
It's the least I could do.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.855
How's Caitlin, by the way?

23:08.888 --> 23:10.757
I've thought of her often

23:10.790 --> 23:12.525
since my last visit.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.528
Go near her, and I don't care

23:15.562 --> 23:18.731
what government agency's
watching your back,

23:18.765 --> 23:20.933
I will kill you this time.

23:20.967 --> 23:24.003
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.945
Where's the device?

23:32.979 --> 23:34.947
Oh, I almost forgot.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.182
I lied.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.017
There is none.

23:54.867 --> 23:57.103
( beeping )

24:02.675 --> 24:06.012
( panting )

24:06.045 --> 24:06.679
( grunts )

24:18.157 --> 24:19.158
Please call me back.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.993
That's 20 messages I left.

24:21.027 --> 24:22.261
We should look for him, McGee.

24:22.294 --> 24:22.829
GIBBS:
Look for who?

24:22.862 --> 24:25.097
We've been calling you

24:25.131 --> 24:26.533
for the last hour, boss.

24:26.566 --> 24:27.834
Well, yeah,
my ringer thing

24:27.867 --> 24:28.935
got turned off.

24:28.968 --> 24:29.936
You're never going to believe

24:29.969 --> 24:30.937
who's back in town.

24:30.970 --> 24:31.938
Ari.

24:31.971 --> 24:33.540
Maybe you will.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.042
Fornell said
that he's here to...

24:36.075 --> 24:37.276
Kill me. Yeah.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.780
I know.
I just had coffee with him.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.182
So... what happened?

24:43.215 --> 24:46.185
He tried to kill me.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.521
We find out
what Westfall's

24:48.555 --> 24:50.022
doing in Aberdeen yet?

24:50.056 --> 24:53.993
Uh, boss, aren't you gonna
elaborate a little bit first?

24:54.026 --> 24:55.294
Well, yeah, McGee, I'm alive.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.996
Now tell me about Westfall.

24:57.029 --> 24:59.031
Uh, he was only
attached to Aberdeen.

24:59.065 --> 25:02.134
He was actually working
with an aerospace contractor

25:02.168 --> 25:03.570
in Maryland-- Danborn Avionics.

25:03.603 --> 25:04.737
Doing what?

25:04.771 --> 25:06.105
Testing field
service modules,

25:06.138 --> 25:07.940
or something like that--
I have no idea.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.642
The FBI sent a team over

25:09.676 --> 25:11.611
to the company
to investigate their security.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.079
The FBI?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.213
A lot's happened
in the last hour.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.214
Where's Fornell?
!
MTAC.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.584
Make the ringer thing work.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.190
Is it me
or did he take

25:24.223 --> 25:25.992
the whole Ari
situation really well?

25:26.025 --> 25:28.027
That's 'cause he's
looking forward to it.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.862
Looking forward to what?

25:29.896 --> 25:32.765
Finally getting
to kill him.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.802
How long
did you know

25:35.835 --> 25:36.803
that bastard was here?

25:36.836 --> 25:37.870
We had our
reasons, Gibbs.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.006
How long?

25:40.039 --> 25:43.175
About a week.

25:43.209 --> 25:44.644
We didn't know what
his cover mission

25:44.677 --> 25:45.745
was with Al Qaeda
until today.

25:45.778 --> 25:46.746
I'm taking him down.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.748
Not this time.

25:48.781 --> 25:50.082
The FBI
can handle this.

25:50.116 --> 25:51.884
The civilians in the coffee shop

25:51.918 --> 25:53.152
that he tried
to blow up today

25:53.185 --> 25:54.587
would probably disagree
with you, Tobias.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.055
Look, if it was up to me,

25:56.088 --> 25:57.323
I'd put a round
through his forehead.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.791
It's not.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.693
You're sitting this one out.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.895
You gonna try to stop me?

26:02.929 --> 26:04.330
No.

26:04.363 --> 26:07.700
No, not me, Jethro.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.746
Ari has been declared

26:19.779 --> 26:21.648
off limits--
NCIS will have

26:21.681 --> 26:23.315
no further involvement
in the case.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.117
You're kidding, sir.

26:25.151 --> 26:25.985
I've also been ordered

26:26.018 --> 26:27.620
to place you under
protective custody...

26:27.654 --> 26:29.689
for your own safety.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.124
Meaning for Ari's?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.626
Take it for what it is,

26:33.660 --> 26:34.994
a direct order,
Agent Gibbs.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.196
And you damn well better
follow it to the letter.

26:37.229 --> 26:38.665
Yes, sir.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.733
I'd also like to take
this opportunity

26:40.767 --> 26:42.935
to offer you my
resignation, sir.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.071
And I will accept it,

26:45.104 --> 26:47.139
after you've completes
your current case.

26:47.173 --> 26:49.709
Sir?

26:49.742 --> 26:51.143
Have you found any evidence
connecting Ari

26:51.177 --> 26:53.145
to the murder
of our two Naval officers?

26:53.179 --> 26:55.782
No, we haven't, sir.

26:55.815 --> 26:58.050
I will now hand you over
to our federally certified

26:58.084 --> 27:00.753
protective custody expert,
Agent Todd.

27:00.787 --> 27:02.354
I hear she used to protect

27:02.388 --> 27:04.356
the President.
You should be flattered.

27:04.390 --> 27:05.157
He's all yours.

27:05.191 --> 27:08.194
I expect you
to follow her orders

27:08.227 --> 27:10.296
to the letter,
as if they were mine.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.033
KATE:
That last part?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.367
He meant.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.003
In his home,

27:17.036 --> 27:18.370
two teams,
six-hour shifts.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.872
Alternating
radio checks

27:19.906 --> 27:20.707
every ten minutes.

27:20.740 --> 27:23.042
Outside,
I want a mobile foot patrol

27:23.075 --> 27:24.276
and two permanent
observation posts.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.879
Gibbs is not gonna like that.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.114
Well, screw what he likes, Tony.

27:28.147 --> 27:31.083
I'm not going to let that psycho
within five miles of Gibbs.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.719
McGee, I need full audio

27:32.752 --> 27:34.386
and video surveillance,
inside and out.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.055
Everything tied
back in MTAC.
You got it, Kate.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.757
GIBBS:
Go home. It's late.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.125
Uh, Gibbs, I don't think

27:39.158 --> 27:40.760
we're gonna
be going home.

27:40.793 --> 27:41.928
I'm staying here.

27:41.961 --> 27:42.895
I do not need an army of agents

27:42.929 --> 27:47.099
staying up all night
watching me build a boat.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.170
You won't leave the building?

27:51.203 --> 27:55.207
If I do, I'll call you.

27:55.241 --> 27:58.144
Go. Go home.
Get some sleep.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.879
First thing tomorrow morning,
we're gonna check out

27:59.912 --> 28:03.215
Danborn Avionics, find
out what the FBI missed.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.984
Go.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.263
( faint snoring )

28:44.223 --> 28:46.125
( faint snoring )

28:58.805 --> 29:02.374
( distant siren wails )

29:08.948 --> 29:11.784
( yawning )

29:26.098 --> 29:27.166
Did you miss me?

29:27.199 --> 29:28.801
Gibbs.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.070
You dream
about Gibbs?

29:31.103 --> 29:33.505
What? No. God, no.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.041
You just said his name.

29:35.074 --> 29:36.342
No, I didn't.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.376
Yes, you did.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.811
McGEE:
What's going on?

29:38.845 --> 29:41.881
Kate dreams about Gibbs.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.883
Oh, what was it about?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.284
No, I didn't

29:45.317 --> 29:46.585
dream about Gibbs.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.454
She screamed his name.
Really?

29:52.158 --> 29:53.125
Here you go.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.961
Look, if you want to check out

29:54.994 --> 29:57.263
the defense contracting
company with us today,

29:57.296 --> 29:59.331
you're wearing a vest.

30:02.268 --> 30:02.935
I can live with that.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.804
That's kind of the point, Gibbs.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.276
MAN:
Lieutenant Westfall
was the military liaison

30:10.309 --> 30:11.911
for Danborn's
Modular UAV project.

30:11.944 --> 30:14.146
And like I told the FBI,

30:14.180 --> 30:16.315
I really doubt his murder

30:16.348 --> 30:17.616
had anything to do with it.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.985
TONY:
Modular UAV?

30:19.018 --> 30:20.920
It's an unmanned
aerial vehicle

30:20.953 --> 30:22.254
we're developing with the Navy.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.355
It can be reconfigured

30:23.389 --> 30:24.991
for different missions
in the field.

30:25.024 --> 30:26.525
What kind of missions?
Reconnaissance,

30:26.558 --> 30:28.360
nuclear and biological
agent testing,

30:28.394 --> 30:30.562
uh, ground attack.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.164
So it can be used as a weapon?

30:32.198 --> 30:34.400
Some day.
It's only a prototype.

30:34.433 --> 30:36.402
Oh, and, uh,
before you ask,

30:36.435 --> 30:38.337
we changed
all our security codes

30:38.370 --> 30:41.941
and removed Westfall's
from the system last night.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.110
Follow me.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.316
TONY:
Any chance of your
modular UAVs is missing?

30:50.349 --> 30:51.984
Nope-- we only
have one

30:52.018 --> 30:53.419
and that's her
in the hangar.

30:53.452 --> 30:55.955
What are these?

30:55.988 --> 30:57.123
Scale models

30:57.156 --> 30:58.457
we use in wind tunnel tests.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.126
Any of your
security

31:00.159 --> 31:02.061
systems rely on fingerprint

31:02.094 --> 31:04.030
or palm-scanning
technology, Mr. Eberlee?

31:04.063 --> 31:05.497
Why?

31:05.531 --> 31:07.433
Lieutenant Westfall
was missing his hands.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.035
Someone hacked them off.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.169
Uh...

31:10.202 --> 31:13.039
the FBI didn't
mention that.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.473
We did.
What's the answer?

31:14.506 --> 31:17.343
Our radio flight control systems
use biometrics.

31:17.376 --> 31:19.545
Only pilots entered into
the system can fly them.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.081
KATE:
Like Westfall.

31:22.114 --> 31:24.984
Yeah, but we only have one
flyable UAV and that's it.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.485
What about these?

31:26.518 --> 31:28.020
Those are target drones.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.989
Danborn Avionics
got its start

31:30.022 --> 31:32.058
making them
in the 1970s.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.994
They're relics,
they're not operational.

31:35.027 --> 31:36.996
Looks like one's missing.

31:37.029 --> 31:39.531
It was, uh, it was
probably moved.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.700
Where?

31:41.733 --> 31:44.136
We sometimes use
them for spare parts.
Mm-hmm.

31:44.170 --> 31:47.373
Look, it's not possible.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.009
I mean, you'd need
a team of engineers

31:50.042 --> 31:52.144
to get one of these heaps
in flying shape.

31:52.178 --> 31:55.147
Not to mention, you need
a radio flight control.

31:55.181 --> 31:57.583
And I'll bet Lieutenant
Westfall's is missing.

32:00.152 --> 32:03.589
( indistinct conversations )

32:09.228 --> 32:13.199
( indistinct conversations
in Arabic )

32:30.682 --> 32:32.418
According to these schematics,
the drone's

32:32.451 --> 32:34.520
pretty outdated
from a tech perspective, Gibbs.

32:34.553 --> 32:35.554
So is a hand grenade.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.623
Excellent point.

32:37.656 --> 32:38.991
ABBY:
The Danborn TX-Bravo

32:39.025 --> 32:40.159
is basically a jet-propelled

32:40.192 --> 32:42.394
RC plane, meaning
it's manually controlled

32:42.428 --> 32:44.130
by a radio transmitter.

32:44.163 --> 32:46.698
The transmitter they stole
was for a modern UAV?

32:46.732 --> 32:48.767
They might not be able
to fly it.

32:48.800 --> 32:49.935
True, true,
but Danborn's flight codes

32:49.968 --> 32:52.071
are based on the original
software, so a few tweaks...

32:52.104 --> 32:53.505
What's the range?
40 miles.

32:53.539 --> 32:55.674
Unless if they load it down
with explosives.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.209
Oh, they will.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.410
Payload would
have to be pretty small.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.579
25 pounds or less if they want
to get it off the ground.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.780
Not a lot of bang
for your buck.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.049
It is if
you're going

33:03.082 --> 33:05.117
after a soft target, Abbs.
Soft target?

33:05.151 --> 33:06.118
People.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.254
Oh.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.588
Any way to stop it
if it's launched?

33:09.621 --> 33:11.557
It wouldn't be hard
to destabilize the system.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.092
I have the operational
frequencies.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.426
Another controller

33:14.460 --> 33:16.095
could probably jam it.
Get me another controller.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.429
But, Gibbs, there's a catch.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.199
You'd have to be
within a 40-mile range

33:20.232 --> 33:22.000
to jam it.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.471
Hey.

33:25.504 --> 33:28.240
I had a weird dream
about Tony last night.
Eww.

33:28.274 --> 33:30.642
Not the one where you two
are at the zoo, and he...
No, no.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.578
He's fully clothed
in this one.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.646
But he had blood
all over his face.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.282
I woke up crying, Kate.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.217
I never cry.
Never, ever, ever.

33:38.250 --> 33:40.219
Hey, it was just a bête noire.

33:40.252 --> 33:43.055
Gotta go.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.226
GIBBS:
What do you got?

33:47.259 --> 33:48.327
A shot of our drone thieves

33:48.360 --> 33:51.163
from Danborn's security footage
from two nights ago.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.265
The day the lieutenants
were murdered.
Can you I.D. them?

33:53.299 --> 33:55.201
TONY:
Well, they're both
wearing ski masks,

33:55.234 --> 33:56.535
but check this out.

33:57.603 --> 33:58.670
Maybe I'm paranoid,

33:58.704 --> 34:00.372
but does that guy
look familiar?

34:03.442 --> 34:05.377
( gunshot )
( man grunts )

34:08.647 --> 34:12.451
( laughing )

34:13.552 --> 34:15.487
You-/////!re not paranoid.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.156
That bastard's Ari.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.724
He's not looking
for an Al Qaeda cell.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.126
Hell, no.

34:20.159 --> 34:22.361
He's running it.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.562
You get Fornell in here.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.131
How much should I tell him?

34:25.164 --> 34:27.233
Tell him he's about to make
the second biggest

34:27.266 --> 34:29.268
mistake of his life.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.108
What...

34:36.142 --> 34:39.178
FORNELL:
My second biggest mistake,
Jethro?

34:39.211 --> 34:41.113
That's very dramatic.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.481
What was the first?

34:42.514 --> 34:45.317
When you married
my second wife.

34:45.351 --> 34:47.119
FORNELL:
You could have
warned me.

34:47.153 --> 34:50.156
I did.

34:50.189 --> 34:51.323
In my own defense,

34:51.357 --> 34:52.491
I thought he was exaggerating.

34:52.524 --> 34:54.460
He wasn't.

34:54.493 --> 34:56.628
Where's Ari?

34:56.662 --> 34:58.597
What part of, "Sit this
out," don't you get?

34:58.630 --> 35:00.599
The part where he steals
a Navy UAV

35:00.632 --> 35:02.334
and kills a whole bunch
of people with it.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.802
My people checked out
Danborn Avionics.

35:03.835 --> 35:04.636
Their only UAV
is accounted for.

35:04.670 --> 35:06.138
He stole a target
drone, Fornell.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.873
Pull it up.

35:07.906 --> 35:10.142
GIBBS:
Pack the nose of that
with Semtex,

35:10.176 --> 35:12.878
he's got a poor man's
cruise missile.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.480
Guess your boys missed it.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.682
Ari's playing you.

35:17.749 --> 35:19.318
He's no double agent--

35:19.351 --> 35:20.652
he never has been.

35:20.686 --> 35:22.788
Where is he?

35:26.258 --> 35:27.893
All we've got is an encrypted

35:27.926 --> 35:30.629
spook cell
phone number.
Call him.

35:30.662 --> 35:32.898
You can't trace it
from here, Gibbs.

35:32.931 --> 35:33.899
Need a high-level
NSA intercept.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.534
Patch us through.
FORNELL:
We're talking

35:35.567 --> 35:37.169
dedicated
satellite
time and...

35:37.203 --> 35:39.338
I've got two NSA satellites

35:39.371 --> 35:40.639
in range for the next

35:40.672 --> 35:42.341
five minutes, Gunny.

35:42.374 --> 35:44.276
What's the number?

35:46.878 --> 35:48.814
Are you sure about this?

35:48.847 --> 35:50.349
As sure as when I told you

35:50.382 --> 35:52.818
she would clean out
your bank account when she left.

36:01.460 --> 36:03.262
Patching it through now.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.496
( typing )

36:04.530 --> 36:06.732
Sure he's going to answer?

36:06.765 --> 36:09.368
Put my name on his caller I.D.

36:09.401 --> 36:10.269
He'll answer.

36:10.302 --> 36:11.670
( dialing )

36:16.475 --> 36:18.210
( speaking Arabic )

36:18.244 --> 36:23.315
( phone ringing )

36:28.920 --> 36:31.223
Special Agent Gibbs,

36:31.257 --> 36:33.692
now, how did you
get this number?

36:33.725 --> 36:35.861
I pulled some strings.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.229
Yes, your friend Fornell.

36:37.263 --> 36:38.464
I imagine he's there with you.

36:38.497 --> 36:39.598
Nope.

36:39.631 --> 36:42.368
Nope. I've been
thrown off the case.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.338
It's for the best.

36:46.372 --> 36:49.007
I really wasn't looking forward
to killing you.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.377
I wish I could say
the same thing, Ari.

36:51.410 --> 36:53.512
I've resigned from NCIS.

36:54.413 --> 36:56.582
I hope it wasn't
something I said.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.819
Next time we meet, Ari,

37:00.852 --> 37:03.422
will be the last time.

37:03.455 --> 37:04.923
There won't be anybody
to stop me.

37:04.956 --> 37:07.693
Gibbs, I'm honored.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.995
I had no idea
you made so much of a...

37:10.028 --> 37:12.464
( line disconnects )

37:12.498 --> 37:15.033
CRANSTON:
He's on a cell phone grid
30 miles out of Norfolk.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.902
Newport News area.
Let's go.

37:16.935 --> 37:20.272
I've got it isolated down
to a two-block radius.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.642
What the hell
is he doing in Norfolk?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.978
GIBBS:
You know how to work that

37:27.012 --> 37:28.480
if we have to jam
the drone, McGee?

37:28.514 --> 37:32.351
Uh, well,
Abby explained it to me

37:32.384 --> 37:33.485
but I to got to be
honest with you, boss...

37:33.519 --> 37:35.554
( revs engine, tires screech )

37:35.587 --> 37:36.422
I'll figure it out.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.790
What's today's date, Kate?

37:38.824 --> 37:39.825
Uh, May 24th.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.327
Paula Cassidy's ship
gets back

37:41.360 --> 37:42.628
from the Gulf today.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.396
We're hooking up
this weekend.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.997
Well, don't you think
you should concentrate

37:46.031 --> 37:47.366
on the terrorist attack first?

37:47.399 --> 37:48.734
The whole Marine
Amphibious Strike Group

37:48.767 --> 37:49.635
returns today, Kate.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.837
Five ships, all of them
headed to Norfolk.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.605
McGEE:
Tony, I doubt that a drone,

37:53.639 --> 37:55.441
even one packed with explosives,

37:55.474 --> 37:56.908
could do any real damage
to a warship.

37:56.942 --> 37:59.778
The pier will be packed
with Navy families, McGee.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.413
Welcoming them home.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.519
( band playing,
people talking excitedly )

38:09.855 --> 38:11.657
( boat horn honks )

38:15.794 --> 38:19.365
( cheering )

38:20.399 --> 38:23.469
You want to give
him a teddy bear?
Yeah.

38:23.502 --> 38:25.904
Huh? Look at this.
Yeah.

38:29.541 --> 38:31.076
Locator beacon is set.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.580
You figured it out?

38:34.613 --> 38:36.081
I did.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.383
The, uh, drone
is on one

38:37.416 --> 38:38.850
of three
radio frequencies.

38:38.884 --> 38:40.386
It'll take a few
minutes to jam

38:40.419 --> 38:41.620
each of them, but when
I hit the freq it's on

38:41.653 --> 38:42.821
the drone should go off-target.
TONY:
It's gonna take hours

38:42.854 --> 38:45.524
to search these warehouses,
boss.
Give me the shotgun.

38:46.792 --> 38:48.394
( cocks gun )

38:49.160 --> 38:50.562
( man yells )

38:51.062 --> 38:52.364
( grunts )

38:53.432 --> 38:54.900
Tony,
take the fire escape.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.034
Kate, with me.

38:56.067 --> 38:56.935
McGee, start jamming.

39:00.071 --> 39:01.507
( all panting )

39:23.862 --> 39:24.696
( gunfire )

39:30.769 --> 39:32.170
( distant yelling )

39:32.203 --> 39:33.805
( device beeping )

39:47.152 --> 39:49.054
( gunshots hailing )

39:51.122 --> 39:52.123
( man yells )

39:55.494 --> 39:56.995
Boss, they fired the drone.

39:57.028 --> 39:57.729
Jam it, McGee!

39:57.763 --> 40:01.433
I can do this.
I can do this.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.707
( crowd cheering )

40:12.644 --> 40:14.546
Miss me?

40:16.214 --> 40:17.549
( beeping )

40:21.520 --> 40:22.688
( panting )

40:22.721 --> 40:24.022
Got one down, boss.

40:24.055 --> 40:25.524
No visual on anyone else.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.558
Let's do it.

40:35.233 --> 40:37.636
( speaking Arabic )

40:48.614 --> 40:51.750
( gunshots )

40:57.623 --> 40:58.957
TONY:
Clear.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.826
GIBBS:
McGee, this thing
is still flying!

41:00.859 --> 41:03.695
Okay, one freq down,
two to go!

41:04.996 --> 41:06.164
( gunshot )
( grunts )

41:08.099 --> 41:09.668
( gunshots )

41:17.576 --> 41:18.677
Boss, one of them

41:18.710 --> 41:19.811
shot my transmitter.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.647
You know how to
fly this thing?

41:21.680 --> 41:23.649
No, but I know
how to crash it.

41:24.716 --> 41:25.717
( gunshots )

41:28.119 --> 41:29.988
McGee, you okay?

41:30.956 --> 41:32.691
I got one terrorist inside.

41:32.724 --> 41:33.925
I don't know if I got him,

41:33.959 --> 41:35.093
but he stopped shooting.

41:35.126 --> 41:36.695
GIBBS:
Hold your position;

41:36.728 --> 41:37.763
we'll flush him.
Okay.

41:37.796 --> 41:39.631
I'm out.

41:39.665 --> 41:40.532
Me, too.

41:42.768 --> 41:43.769
Shooter!

41:43.802 --> 41:44.836
( gunshot )

41:51.643 --> 41:52.678
TONY:
Kate!

41:58.717 --> 42:00.251
( sighs )

42:00.285 --> 42:02.654
You okay?

42:02.688 --> 42:04.189
Ow!

42:04.222 --> 42:06.658
I just got shot
at point-blank range, DiNozzo.

42:06.692 --> 42:08.226
What do you think?
You're not gonna

42:08.259 --> 42:09.961
be going to Pilates
class tomorrow?

42:09.995 --> 42:11.096
Oh...

42:11.129 --> 42:13.565
( groans )

42:13.599 --> 42:17.135
Protection detail's
over, Kate.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.605
You did good.

42:19.638 --> 42:22.307
For once, DiNozzo's right.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.909
( chuckles ):
Wow.

42:23.942 --> 42:25.811
I thought I'd die
before I ever heard...

42:25.844 --> 42:28.046
( gunshot )

42:30.649 --> 42:33.719
Sorry, Caitlin.

42:39.925 --> 42:46.865
Ari.
