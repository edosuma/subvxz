00:39.539 --> 00:42.201
We're not a threat. We're salvation.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.570
The world will have to deal with us.

00:46.246 --> 00:48.146
Previously on The 4400:

00:48.314 --> 00:50.441
Do you know who I am?

00:50.617 --> 00:53.609
As soon as I am free, you and the world
will know what I know.

00:53.787 --> 00:55.948
My son is in prison.
You're the one who can get him out.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.090
Did you kill me?

00:58.258 --> 01:01.386
That's Jordan Collier!
Tell them I didn't kill you!

01:01.561 --> 01:03.552
You're gonna get married. I saw it.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.492
Did you happen to see
who the lucky guy was?

01:05.665 --> 01:07.326
Someone just told me
that I met the woman

01:07.500 --> 01:09.468
that I'm supposed to be with,
and I can't ignore it.

01:09.636 --> 01:10.898
He broke up with me!

01:11.337 --> 01:13.737
- I've done bad things.
- You are the enemy.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.306
Tell me what to do. I'll do anything.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.841
Leave the 4400 Center
and never come back.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.776
They won't be able to hide for long.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.811
Dr. Burkhoff's
not exactly inconspicuous.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.311
We are proud
to announce the existence

01:25.485 --> 01:27.453
of this Enhanced Soldier program.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.555
In time, they'll become
the first non-4400s

01:30.723 --> 01:34.523
to develop extra-human abilities
in the defense of the United States.

01:34.694 --> 01:37.185
You have a source of promicin
for your program. Who is it?

01:37.363 --> 01:40.628
That stuff happens
way above my security clearance.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.826
The soldiers, are you really gonna
use them to defend the country?

01:44.003 --> 01:45.732
Or are you just gonna send them
after the 4400?

01:45.905 --> 01:46.929
Is there a difference?

01:49.742 --> 01:53.143
Mr. Collier, you've been doing
quite a bit of press since your...

01:53.313 --> 01:54.405
Resurrection.

01:54.581 --> 01:56.242
I suppose some people
are calling it that.

01:56.416 --> 01:58.816
And in every interview, you've been
making the same statement

01:58.985 --> 02:00.316
over and over again.

02:00.487 --> 02:02.978
The war for the future
will be fought in the past.

02:03.156 --> 02:08.219
Exactly. And by past,
do you mean now, today?

02:08.661 --> 02:11.357
It's our shared burden. Yes.

02:11.531 --> 02:15.058
And this war, it's one between
the 4400s and the non-4400s?

02:15.235 --> 02:19.535
No. This is a war
between good and evil.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.339
And it has already started.

02:22.509 --> 02:24.875
Good people,
4400s and non-4400s...

02:25.044 --> 02:26.272
Come on, Kyle. Dinner's ready.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.415
-...have made incredible sacrifices.
- I'll be right there.

02:29.582 --> 02:33.313
And they know they will be called on
to sacrifice even more.

02:33.486 --> 02:36.011
They're among the first to know
the cost of this struggle,

02:36.189 --> 02:41.855
because for better or worse,
all our lives are different now.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.053
Profoundly different.

02:44.597 --> 02:48.260
That's what wars do.
They change us.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.164
But the stakes...

02:52.105 --> 02:55.370
Well, the stakes are nothing less
than the fate of mankind.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.912
But why does there need to be
a war at all?

03:05.451 --> 03:08.887
I've seen the future,
and it's a bleak one.

03:09.422 --> 03:12.653
The human race is old.
It's sick, it's dying.

03:12.825 --> 03:17.728
What's left of civilization is controlled
by a brutal and powerful elite

03:17.897 --> 03:20.331
who have effectively
shut themselves off

03:20.500 --> 03:22.195
in the world's last city

03:22.368 --> 03:25.360
while the rest of humanity
struggle for survival

03:25.538 --> 03:28.132
in the surrounding wasteland.

03:28.308 --> 03:30.970
- Sounds pretty hopeless.
- Doesn't it?

03:31.411 --> 03:32.969
But there is hope.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.814
There is always hope
and it rests with us.

03:36.983 --> 03:41.750
We can change the future,
but we must start now, today.

03:41.921 --> 03:45.084
Everything crucial
to the world's survival, its prosperity--

03:45.258 --> 03:49.126
The resources of this planet:
food, water, energy.

03:49.295 --> 03:53.823
The genetic materials of life itself.
--already, even as I speak,

03:54.000 --> 03:58.130
are being gathered up and controlled
by a powerful and isolated few.

03:58.304 --> 04:02.934
This must stop. We must stop it.

04:13.119 --> 04:18.386
Our enemies are strong,
and they grow stronger daily.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.127
And they will go to any lengths
to maintain their dominance,

04:23.296 --> 04:28.996
to confine us to our current path,
a path leading only to disaster.

04:29.168 --> 04:33.605
Only to the catastrophic future
that awaits us.

04:33.773 --> 04:38.540
We must band together to fight this,

04:38.711 --> 04:42.203
this evil amongst us.

04:42.382 --> 04:46.751
An evil that would destroy us all.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.323
We won't have another chance.

04:52.158 --> 04:54.251
Look, I'm telling you,
I don't know what happened, okay?

04:54.427 --> 04:56.588
One minute I'm going over
the bulletins with Havemeyer.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.823
Next thing I know, I got drool all over
my shirt, and Havemeyer's snoring.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.899
So you're saying the night shift
just fell asleep?

05:02.068 --> 05:04.468
Fell asleep, passed out.
I don't remember.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.298
- What the hell is going on?
- Good question.

05:06.472 --> 05:09.771
I've got an entire building full of agents
who can't remember a damn thing.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.172
And while they were napping,
every member of the Nova Group

05:12.345 --> 05:14.245
in NTAC custody
walked out the front door.

05:14.414 --> 05:15.642
Yeah, walked, ran, flew.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.874
No way of knowing since they erased
the security tapes.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.952
But every 4400 downstairs gets
injected with the promicin inhibitor.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.213
So none of them
could've used their abilities to escape.

05:23.389 --> 05:25.584
They must have had help.
Someone on the outside, a 4400.

05:25.758 --> 05:26.952
No, more than one.

05:27.126 --> 05:29.890
Someone to knock our people out,
another to disable the security system.

05:30.063 --> 05:32.896
So we talking sympathizers
or members we've never caught?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.830
Either way, it looks like someone's
putting the Nova Group back together.

06:40.700 --> 06:44.227
Paul Newbold has the ability
to raise or lower body temperature.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.599
Tina Richardson,
she wipes memories.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.673
She can make you forget
what you had for breakfast,

06:48.841 --> 06:50.331
or she can erase your entire life.

06:51.544 --> 06:53.171
Then there's my old friend
Boyd Gelder,

06:53.346 --> 06:55.177
who can take over your entire life.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.576
The ultimate impersonator.

06:56.749 --> 07:00.446
Any one of these people is capable
of wreaking serious havoc.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.917
Well, they've done it before.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.648
We have to assume someone broke
them out so they could do it again.

07:05.124 --> 07:09.493
The Nova Group has a lot of scores
to settle, starting with your nephew.

07:09.662 --> 07:12.460
I called Shawn.
The 4400 Center's already a fortress.

07:12.632 --> 07:14.259
But he'll make sure
to kick it up a level.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.231
Dennis Ryland's gotta be high
on their hit list.

07:16.402 --> 07:18.302
Yeah, and Alana and Kyle.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.962
Boyd came after my family before.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.836
Go. I'll send some agents over
to watch your house.

07:27.346 --> 07:29.814
It's him. Here we go.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.145
- Can we ask you one question, sir?
- Agent Baldwin, one more question.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.287
Agent Baldwin,
why won't your son make a statement?

07:35.455 --> 07:37.218
Did someone pay him
to shoot Jordan Collier?

07:37.390 --> 07:39.221
Did he always know Collier
was alive?

07:42.595 --> 07:44.825
Just one question.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.693
So how long are we gonna be stuck
in here, a few days, couple of months?

07:50.870 --> 07:52.030
Hopefully not too long.

07:52.205 --> 07:54.469
We caught Boyd Gelder once,
we'll track him down again.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.631
In the meantime, Kyle,
you need to stay close to home.

07:56.809 --> 07:59.539
Don't go anywhere
unless it's absolutely necessary.

07:59.712 --> 08:01.703
That shouldn't be too bad.

08:01.881 --> 08:06.147
After all, you could still be in prison,
I could still be living on the run.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.753
Compared to that,
staying close to home is kind of nice.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.481
And before you know it,
you'll be heading back to school.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.056
She has a point, Kyle.

08:14.293 --> 08:16.227
Did you see those registration forms
I left for you?

08:16.395 --> 08:18.022
If you like, I could--

08:18.197 --> 08:20.324
You know, I could run them over
to the admissions office.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.695
I'm not sure I'm ready
to go back to school.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.836
If you wanna wait a semester,
that's up to you.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.667
But I figured, you know,
going back to school

08:28.841 --> 08:30.638
will help things get back to normal.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.038
Dad, have you looked outside?

08:32.211 --> 08:36.705
- That's not going to happen.
- Kyle, you just have to be patient.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.249
Dad, I know you're trying to help,

08:39.418 --> 08:41.385
but Jordan Collier came back
from the dead.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.249
No one's ever gonna forget that.

08:43.422 --> 08:45.219
As long as they remember
Jordan Collier,

08:45.391 --> 08:47.450
they're gonna remember
the guy who shot him.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.831
I warned Nina Jarvis.

08:52.999 --> 08:55.229
I told her that NTAC
was totally unprepared

08:55.401 --> 08:58.063
for the threat posed by these people.

08:58.237 --> 09:00.432
Did she listen? No.

09:01.007 --> 09:02.235
And here's the result.

09:02.408 --> 09:05.741
NTAC is literally asleep
at their desks,

09:05.912 --> 09:09.905
while the most dangerous 4400s
stroll out the door.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.879
We're talking about the Nova Group.

09:12.051 --> 09:14.679
Violent terrorists.
This isn't about the 4400.

09:14.854 --> 09:18.221
Tom, I'm sure you'll agree that
that distinction's become meaningless.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.326
Every one of the 4400
has developed an ability.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.725
That means every 4400
is a potential enemy.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.627
You know, my daughter's in the
5th grade. She isn't anyone's enemy.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.427
Children grow up, Diana.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.470
Look, Dennis, we don't know
what the Nova is planning.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.469
But they have targeted you before.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.666
Now, NTAC is ready to offer you
any protection you might need.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.004
Well, that's very generous, Tom.

09:40.179 --> 09:41.806
But if my memory serves me,

09:41.981 --> 09:43.949
the Nova Group
made two attempts on my life

09:44.116 --> 09:45.811
while I was under NTAC protection.

09:45.985 --> 09:47.748
Two unsuccessful attempts.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.911
Don't sound so disappointed.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.789
Would you come in a moment,
please?

09:53.960 --> 09:56.451
This time I'm arranging
for my own security.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.123
Hello.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.299
We were just discussing the newest
threat posed by the Nova Group.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.136
Oh, there is no threat.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.536
Not while I'm around anyway.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.711
Your uncle,
he actually saw them together?

10:18.884 --> 10:20.909
My daughter and Ryland?

10:21.087 --> 10:23.351
At least now we know
where she's been for the last week.

10:23.522 --> 10:27.117
Jordan should have talked to us
before he made her leave.

10:29.261 --> 10:31.491
It was like he delivered her
right to Ryland.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.865
I don't know about that.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.196
If she's the source
of Ryland's promicin,

10:36.369 --> 10:37.836
that means that she was working
with him

10:38.004 --> 10:39.631
Iong before she left the Center.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.204
Maybe one of us could talk to her

10:41.374 --> 10:43.638
and make sure she knows
who she's working with.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.504
When my daughter's
made up her mind,

10:45.678 --> 10:47.839
there's no changing it.
You know that.

10:48.681 --> 10:49.909
I'm sorry, Richard.

10:57.657 --> 11:02.685
All her life, I've been trying
to see something good in lsabelle.

11:03.295 --> 11:05.320
Some kind of light,
something to nurture.

11:06.232 --> 11:08.564
Maybe I've just been
wasting my time...

11:10.636 --> 11:13.264
...because it's never been there.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.604
Maia, I'm home.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.379
I didn't get a chance
to get to the store.

11:23.549 --> 11:25.949
I thought we could order in a pizza.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.609
Don't worry about me. I already ate.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.619
Oh, I can see that.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.219
Why won't he call me back?

11:33.392 --> 11:35.257
Who? Ben?

11:36.295 --> 11:39.025
I left him five messages.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.733
I just want him to know
that I forgive him, you know?

11:43.903 --> 11:49.273
It's probably my fault.
I probably pushed him away.

11:51.110 --> 11:55.945
Well, sitting here blaming yourself
is not helping.

11:57.616 --> 12:00.050
Do you think he met someone else?

12:07.093 --> 12:10.358
You need to get up, take a shower,
change your clothes.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.123
And let's all go out to dinner.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.994
What if he calls?

12:19.472 --> 12:20.939
Answer my cell, okay?

12:22.208 --> 12:23.800
Sure.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.843
And if he calls, be nice to him.

12:27.513 --> 12:28.844
Because when we
get back together,

12:29.014 --> 12:31.949
I do not want there to be
any weirdness between the two of you.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.654
Hi, honey.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.695
We had a deal.
No video games before dinner.

12:46.899 --> 12:49.663
- Maia.
- I needed a break.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.827
- From what?
- Aunt April.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.800
I'm sorry, sweetie.

12:54.974 --> 12:57.238
She hasn't stopped from the second
I came home from school.

12:57.409 --> 12:59.809
She keeps asking me
if they're gonna get back together.

13:00.913 --> 13:04.144
Well, you're gonna have to go easy
on your Aunt April.

13:04.316 --> 13:06.876
She's going through
a really rough time.

13:07.052 --> 13:10.579
But you and Ben,
you were supposed to be together.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.524
Maybe if you told her
about what I saw...

13:13.692 --> 13:15.887
Somehow I don't think
that's gonna make her feel better.

13:16.061 --> 13:18.859
Well, she's gonna know
about you two sooner or later.

13:19.031 --> 13:23.400
I mean, you are going to invite her
to your wedding.

13:27.606 --> 13:28.834
What do you think?

13:31.710 --> 13:33.871
You look remarkable. I'm impressed.

13:36.715 --> 13:38.012
Jordan?

13:39.084 --> 13:40.346
Are we interrupting something?

13:40.519 --> 13:44.011
No. Not at all.
Is everything okay?

13:44.190 --> 13:45.987
Not really.
We just talked to my Uncle Tommy.

13:46.158 --> 13:48.820
He told us that lsabelle
and Dennis Ryland

13:48.994 --> 13:50.222
are working together.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.588
I see.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.569
Jordan, did you hear
what I just told you?

13:59.004 --> 14:01.666
Kicking lsabelle out of here
may not have been the best decision.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.672
While lsabelle was here,
she was a threat.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.174
Her alliance with Dennis Ryland

14:05.344 --> 14:07.904
simply makes it clear
where her loyalty lies.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.405
And clarity's a good thing, yes?

14:10.583 --> 14:14.178
But we still have preparations to make
around this place just to be safe.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.342
Yeah.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.148
It's not only lsabelle and Ryland
out there.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.790
We also have Nova Group
to worry about.

14:18.958 --> 14:22.553
The Nova Group is no longer
our enemy, isn't that right?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.696
We don't have a problem with you.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.232
Not anymore.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.729
Shawn, Richard,
have you met Boyd Gelder?

14:32.905 --> 14:35.465
As you can see,
he's quite the impersonator.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.609
What's one of the Nova doing here?

14:37.776 --> 14:40.438
He is a 4400, Shawn.
Where else should he be?

14:40.946 --> 14:43.380
And besides,
I went to a great deal of trouble

14:43.549 --> 14:45.813
to get him and his friends
out of NTAC.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.786
Jordan, this is crazy.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.621
I put my life on the line
trying to protect this place from Nova.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.786
And now we're the ones
that break them out from NTAC?

14:58.964 --> 15:01.057
- What were you thinking?
- That we have a war to fight.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.167
That Nova is a powerful weapon,
which until now,

15:03.335 --> 15:04.734
has lacked proper guidance.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.599
Jordan, they're terrorists.
They kill people.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.433
They did what needed doing.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.074
They chose action
over accommodation.

15:10.242 --> 15:13.006
Not supporting that choice
was a failure, Shawn.

15:13.178 --> 15:15.373
Oh, so I made a mistake
by not backing the Nova Group?

15:15.547 --> 15:17.105
I am saying
you should have been a leader.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.945
These people are willing to sacrifice
themselves for the greater good.

15:20.119 --> 15:22.053
They're the kind of soldiers
we need in this fight.

15:22.221 --> 15:25.281
They're one of the biggest
reasons why people are scared of us.

15:25.457 --> 15:27.755
If we invite them in here,
we become part of the Nova Group.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.191
And everything you've been preaching
since you've been back

15:30.362 --> 15:33.695
about cooperation and unity
between 4400s and non-4400s?

15:33.866 --> 15:35.333
It's never gonna happen.

15:35.501 --> 15:36.866
Richard?

15:37.670 --> 15:39.103
We're running
a big risk here, Jordan.

15:39.271 --> 15:40.966
We're playing for big stakes.

15:41.140 --> 15:44.871
If NTAC finds out we were involved
in the breakout, it'd be bad.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.308
You're sure you covered your tracks?
They're someplace safe?

15:47.479 --> 15:50.175
Along with the 4400s
who helped free them.

15:50.349 --> 15:51.373
They won't be found.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.984
No, no, no, just because
we're not gonna get caught

15:54.153 --> 15:56.053
doesn't make this okay, Richard.

15:56.221 --> 15:57.688
No, tell me
you're not buying into this.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.289
I'm just being realistic.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.723
The fact is we are
more vulnerable than ever.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.125
Isabelle's with Ryland now.

16:05.297 --> 16:07.356
It's only a matter of time
before those soldiers of his

16:07.533 --> 16:10.730
are out there developing abilities.
Jordan is right.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.238
We're playing for big stakes now.

16:26.251 --> 16:29.778
Another month?
That's completely unacceptable.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.856
The initial volunteers
were showing abilities within days.

16:33.025 --> 16:36.552
That's correct, but as you recall,
there were problems. Deaths.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.527
Since the Piersahl incident, we've
scaled back the pace of the promicin.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.097
I never authorized that.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.167
I guaranteed this country
the protection of enhanced troops.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.065
I won't be made a liar by you.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.865
Increase the dosage.

16:48.040 --> 16:51.441
I'll have another shipment of promicin
sent over from Haspel Corp. today.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.840
I don't know why we're wasting time
building an army.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.241
We won't need one.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.575
You're a very powerful
young woman, lsabelle.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.014
But you're still one person.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.176
Think of it as backup.

17:02.354 --> 17:05.084
Well, if that makes you feel
more secure.

17:05.257 --> 17:07.088
But by now, Collier knows
we're working together.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.522
He won't wait a month
to come after us.

17:10.194 --> 17:12.628
If we give those soldiers
the maximum dose of promicin,

17:12.798 --> 17:15.289
how long
before they develop abilities?

17:15.467 --> 17:16.866
Anywhere from two to three days.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.231
Make it two. Why wait?

17:19.405 --> 17:20.929
You heard the lady.

17:21.106 --> 17:24.701
I'll be staying on base
to monitor your progress.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.147
Kyle.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.146
- There he is.
- Hey.

17:37.322 --> 17:38.880
Yes.

17:41.293 --> 17:44.421
Look at you, man. You look great.
I can't believe you're standing here.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.223
We have to celebrate,
we gotta do something.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.389
Yeah, that sounds good.

17:49.134 --> 17:51.500
First I need to ask a favor of you.

17:51.837 --> 17:53.065
Name it.

17:53.238 --> 17:55.934
It's good to see you, Kyle.
I was hoping we could talk.

17:56.942 --> 17:59.308
It's really you, isn't it?

17:59.945 --> 18:01.435
You're alive.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.248
It took a while to believe it myself.

18:04.983 --> 18:07.144
I'm sorry for what I did to you.

18:07.319 --> 18:09.014
There's nothing to be sorry about.

18:09.188 --> 18:10.746
My death had to happen.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.281
I've seen you on TV.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.121
You seem so sure that what we all
went through means something.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.191
I wish I could understand it
the way you do.

18:19.364 --> 18:21.525
To me, it all seems like a waste.

18:21.700 --> 18:24.328
My death was part of a bigger plan.

18:25.671 --> 18:29.539
I know you suffered for it,
and that was unfair.

18:29.708 --> 18:33.439
But everything you did, Kyle,
including my assassination,

18:34.379 --> 18:36.643
was part of that plan.

18:37.015 --> 18:40.109
You have no idea
how important you are.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.354
Tell me we could spend
the whole night together.

18:52.364 --> 18:55.424
I really think that Maia
should be there when I tell her.

18:55.601 --> 18:59.002
That way at least she can explain
the whole prediction thing.

18:59.171 --> 19:01.469
Well, so much for afterglow.

19:02.074 --> 19:04.474
Please tell me you weren't thinking
of April the whole time.

19:04.643 --> 19:08.044
No. I wasn't.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.450
You're right.

19:12.618 --> 19:14.449
We should tell her.

19:15.587 --> 19:18.055
I should do it.
She should hear it from me.

19:19.925 --> 19:22.553
That would be like hiding
behind you.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.356
And I admit that sounds good
right now,

19:25.531 --> 19:28.591
but I'll just only hate myself
even more.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.901
I just wish I knew what to say.

19:31.069 --> 19:34.368
Tell her the truth, you know.

19:34.806 --> 19:37.070
We didn't plan this.

19:37.242 --> 19:40.268
We didn't even want it,
but it happened.

19:41.246 --> 19:42.941
We fell in love.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.181
Isn't it a bit early
to be using that word?

19:46.351 --> 19:48.376
What would you call it?

19:49.821 --> 19:52.881
Oh, God.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.057
It's true.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.021
Two weeks, and I'm in love.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.455
It's a good thing.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.797
I know it is. I mean, it should be.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.974
But I'm in love and I can't enjoy it.
How pathetic is that?

20:16.281 --> 20:18.806
- What's all this?
- I have a lot of time on my hands.

20:18.984 --> 20:20.918
I thought someone
should benefit from it.

20:22.955 --> 20:25.185
Not you. Kyle.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.723
I'm making penne arrabiata.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.554
I'll bet you he hasn't had it
in a while.

20:30.128 --> 20:32.892
- Where is Kyle?
- He'll be home any minute.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.499
He went out? After I told him not to?

20:35.667 --> 20:38.830
He drove to Northmount,
wanted to register for some classes.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.064
That's great.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.538
How did he get past the reporters?

20:43.709 --> 20:45.540
They don't even know he's gone.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.236
I made a pitcher of iced tea
and some sandwiches,

20:48.413 --> 20:49.675
and I brought it out to them.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.807
And I distracted them
while Kyle slipped out the back.

20:53.986 --> 20:56.511
We planned the whole thing together.
It was fun.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.622
I'm glad someone had a good day.

21:00.792 --> 21:03.090
I take it you didn't have
a good day at work.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.095
No. We talked to the family
of every prisoner we lost.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.256
No one has heard or seen anything.

21:08.433 --> 21:11.368
I mean, not that they'd give up
their loved ones so easily.

21:11.536 --> 21:13.504
And then there's always the 4400
who broke them out.

21:14.072 --> 21:15.801
Excuse me, honey.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.909
We haven't made much headway
on that front either.

21:20.479 --> 21:22.606
Kyle's gonna be a happy man.

21:22.781 --> 21:25.113
You think we would've heard
something about a 4400

21:25.284 --> 21:27.946
who can override
a state-of-the-art security system

21:28.120 --> 21:31.214
or cut off oxygen
to a whole building full of people.

21:33.525 --> 21:35.857
I had a student at the Center.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.656
When he first came to school,
he had some problems.

21:38.830 --> 21:42.129
Teachers and the other children
kept having headaches

21:42.301 --> 21:43.996
and fainting when he was around.

21:44.169 --> 21:47.502
It turns out that it was something
about his ability

21:47.673 --> 21:50.164
to change the level of oxygen
in the blood.

21:50.542 --> 21:52.908
Alana, this student,
what was his name?

21:53.078 --> 21:54.272
Michael Lawrence?

21:54.446 --> 21:56.937
You think he had something to do
with the prison break? He's 1 6.

21:57.115 --> 21:59.583
His ability matches up
to what happened to our agents.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.241
And Boyd Gelder isn't much older.

22:01.420 --> 22:02.819
Now, we've spoken
to Michael's father.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.683
He says he hasn't seen his son
in a week.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.619
Shawn, is it possible
there's a new Nova cell

22:06.792 --> 22:07.986
operating out of the Center?

22:08.160 --> 22:11.027
Well, if there were, don't you think
they would've come after me by now?

22:11.196 --> 22:13.528
Well, they still might.
We don't know what they're planning.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.360
You mind if we talk
to some of the students?

22:15.534 --> 22:17.058
See what they can tell us
about Michael?

22:17.235 --> 22:18.930
Yeah, talk to whoever you like.

22:19.104 --> 22:20.969
Listen, Shawn.

22:22.474 --> 22:24.066
Look, I appreciate this.

22:24.242 --> 22:27.177
You know, it really helps to have
someone here we can work with.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.110
I hope that doesn't change
now that Collier's back.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.041
All right.

22:35.821 --> 22:38.051
Michael Lawrence's ability
is unique, useful,

22:38.223 --> 22:40.555
and he controls it
with a great deal of accuracy.

22:40.726 --> 22:42.159
Why wouldn't I make use of him?

22:42.327 --> 22:45.296
Because he's a 1 6-year-old kid
you just turned into a felon.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.989
Shawn, that boy allowed us
to neutralize a building

22:48.166 --> 22:50.600
full of NTAC agents
without hurting anyone.

22:50.769 --> 22:53.932
I think that showed great restraint,
given the urgency of our needs.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.095
What needs, Jordan?

22:55.273 --> 22:57.867
What's so important that we need
to get into bed with the Nova Group?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.068
Come on, I ran this place
while you were gone.

23:00.245 --> 23:02.509
I think I deserve to know
what you're planning.

23:02.681 --> 23:06.981
Ryland's Enhanced Soldier program?
We're going to destroy it.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.319
Destroy how?

23:09.654 --> 23:11.451
With Nova's help,
we'll attack the Army base

23:11.623 --> 23:12.851
where the experiment's conducted.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.548
Take out the lab, the training facility.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.924
And when we find the soldiers
getting promicin, neutralize them.

23:20.832 --> 23:23.699
Attack a military installation?
Jordan, are you insane?

23:23.869 --> 23:25.063
That's how you sound right now.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.330
I don't care what you think
you saw while you were gone.

23:27.506 --> 23:30.669
This is the real world.
Jordan, listen to me.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.675
Do you know how many people
would die on both sides?

23:33.845 --> 23:35.779
We have no choice.

23:35.947 --> 23:39.678
Once those soldiers
develop 4400 abilities,

23:40.085 --> 23:41.882
it will be too late.

23:50.529 --> 23:53.362
There's a gas station.
It's on a highway.

23:55.233 --> 23:57.030
Next to it there's a road sign.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.127
- Can you read the sign?
- Trying.

24:00.305 --> 24:03.206
Something about
a petrified tree stump.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.335
It's the biggest one in the state.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.809
Afraid that's all of it.

24:11.983 --> 24:13.541
That's the thing
with this remote viewing.

24:13.718 --> 24:15.549
I never quite see everything.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.688
That ought to be enough
to find them.

24:24.362 --> 24:29.629
Gas and a quart of oil
comes to 53 even.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.234
Okay.

24:32.170 --> 24:36.163
I hope you can take some time
and visit Newfield's claim to fame.

24:36.341 --> 24:39.742
There's not another stump like it
on the whole West Coast.

24:40.345 --> 24:41.937
We're just passing through.

24:42.113 --> 24:45.708
If I go back the way I came,
will I find the highway?

24:45.884 --> 24:47.681
Oh, she can help you with that.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.645
He wants to get right back
on the highway.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.848
Well, that's easy.

24:54.025 --> 24:57.188
But first I think you should visit
the Newfield stump.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.392
They have
a really nice gift shop there.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.391
The town could sure use
your business.

25:06.905 --> 25:08.395
Yeah.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.642
- I just follow the sign?
- That's right.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.337
And there's a nice diner
along the way.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.209
All the pies are baked fresh.

25:17.382 --> 25:20.078
It sounds good. I'll check that out.
Thank you.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.617
You won't be disappointed.

25:32.864 --> 25:35.128
Those pies come in on a truck.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.928
They need the business.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.872
Dr. Burkhoff, Ms. Doerner.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.211
I'm Jordan Collier.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.215
I'm betting this isn't a coincidence.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.115
How is your research coming?

26:00.525 --> 26:02.425
Keeps my nights interesting.

26:02.827 --> 26:05.921
Mr. Collier, we've made a nice life
for ourselves.

26:06.097 --> 26:08.258
This is a good place for us.

26:08.433 --> 26:11.732
And we like to think that we make
things a little better by being here.

26:12.037 --> 26:13.334
Please don't ruin it.

26:13.505 --> 26:16.906
Were it up to me,
you'd live here happily many years.

26:17.075 --> 26:21.739
But right now,
I need your ability and your intellect.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.381
Oh, hey, sweetie.

26:31.923 --> 26:35.017
I think
it's Grilled Cheese Wednesday.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.318
Where's your Aunt April?

26:37.729 --> 26:40.357
Please don't be mad.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.659
Why would I be mad?

26:44.536 --> 26:45.730
You didn't.

26:45.904 --> 26:50.534
I thought it would make her feel better,
knowing about my vision.

26:50.709 --> 26:53.177
That it's not her fault
that Ben likes you more.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.906
And did it make her feel better?

26:56.081 --> 26:58.481
No, not really.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.647
She's in your room.

27:08.426 --> 27:10.087
April?

27:10.261 --> 27:11.922
In here.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.828
You're out of tissues.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.004
There's more
under the bathroom sink.

27:27.212 --> 27:33.048
You know, one of the reasons
that I liked Ben in the first place

27:33.218 --> 27:37.177
was because I thought, "Here's a guy
my sister would approve of.

27:38.556 --> 27:40.285
Finally."

27:41.393 --> 27:44.760
Well, you were right.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.157
This was it.

27:46.331 --> 27:51.166
My one chance to settle down
with the right guy.

27:53.505 --> 27:56.167
Except it turns out
he's your right guy.

27:57.475 --> 28:00.967
Oh, God, April.
This whole thing with Ben.

28:01.146 --> 28:03.876
I mean, we never meant
for it to happen.

28:07.052 --> 28:09.612
I know that doesn't help much.

28:09.988 --> 28:13.515
I know I'll meet another guy.
I always do.

28:14.125 --> 28:20.086
Meeting them, sleeping with them,
going to the Fetish Ball with them.

28:20.265 --> 28:22.495
That's not the problem.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.395
Finding one that wants to go
to the Fetish Ball with me

28:27.572 --> 28:30.063
year after year.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.701
That's the problem.

28:33.511 --> 28:36.412
Ben's willing to go
to the Fetish Ball with you?

28:37.015 --> 28:39.381
He was considering it.

28:42.487 --> 28:46.787
Look, Di, I wish I could hate you.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.552
I really do.

28:51.129 --> 28:54.121
But I'm too busy hating me.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.725
I'm such a loser.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.695
No. No, you're not.

28:59.871 --> 29:01.896
Yes, I am.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.507
I'm gonna live alone
and I'm gonna die alone.

29:05.677 --> 29:10.740
And all I'm ever gonna be to anyone
is Aunt April, the loser.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.561
Hey, Kyle. You got a second?

29:27.732 --> 29:30.826
Yeah, just getting rid
of some old stuff.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.665
Come on, Dad.
I was 9 when I got that.

29:38.209 --> 29:40.177
Yeah, I remember the day.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.809
Listen, Kyle, you know,
once you go back to school,

29:44.983 --> 29:47.315
I thought I'd float you some cash.

29:47.485 --> 29:48.816
That way you can get
your own place.

29:48.987 --> 29:51.046
so you can have some privacy,
some independence.

29:51.222 --> 29:53.156
I saw Jordan Collier yesterday.

29:54.092 --> 29:57.118
- You went to the Center. Why?
- I had to see him.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.629
We talked.
He helped me realize some things.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.595
What things?

30:04.569 --> 30:06.901
Well, I'm not going back to college,
for one.

30:07.071 --> 30:09.164
Dad, just listen to me. Hear me out.

30:10.441 --> 30:14.707
My life, my future,
it's tied up with the 4400.

30:14.879 --> 30:16.744
That night on the beach
when Shawn was taken,

30:16.915 --> 30:18.940
it should have been me.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.548
If he hadn't pushed me
out of that beam of light,

30:21.719 --> 30:23.949
- I would've been one of them.
- Yeah, but you're not.

30:24.122 --> 30:26.249
Kyle, your life can be
whatever you want it to be.

30:26.424 --> 30:28.051
You just have to be willing
to move forward.

30:28.226 --> 30:31.093
Ever since I woke up from that coma,
I thought I was moving forward.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.254
But Jordan helped me realize
all I was doing was running away.

30:34.432 --> 30:36.559
He told you that?
He told you not to go to college?!

30:36.734 --> 30:39.532
No, Dad, he just listened to me.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.938
I figured it out on my own.

30:44.843 --> 30:46.333
So, what do you do now, Kyle?

30:46.511 --> 30:48.809
You put on a blue blazer
and become one of his disciples?

30:48.980 --> 30:50.675
Give tours at the Center?
Answer phones?

30:50.849 --> 30:52.077
Maybe.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.850
I'm gonna do what you do, Dad.

30:57.355 --> 31:00.381
I'm gonna help the 4400
any way I can.

31:04.095 --> 31:06.529
I'm sorry. I agree with Jordan
on this one, Shawn.

31:06.698 --> 31:07.926
How can you say that?

31:08.099 --> 31:09.589
If we attack that Army base,

31:09.767 --> 31:11.894
it's like declaring war
on the United States government.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.300
Maybe, but it seems to me
we have been in an undeclared war

31:14.472 --> 31:16.133
with the government
ever since we got back.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.571
Locking us in quarantine,
shooting us up with the inhibitor.

31:18.743 --> 31:21.371
Disappearing any of us
they seem threatened by.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.777
All Jordan is doing is bringing
the conflict out into the open.

31:24.949 --> 31:26.610
Jordan is gonna sacrifice
thousands of lives.

31:26.784 --> 31:29.275
It's gonna be for nothing.
We're gonna lose.

31:29.454 --> 31:31.354
If you have another way,

31:31.522 --> 31:34.457
something concrete
that makes us safer,

31:35.393 --> 31:37.327
I'm willing to listen.

31:42.533 --> 31:44.797
Oh, my God.

31:47.138 --> 31:49.163
I didn't think so.

31:51.542 --> 31:54.170
Okay, can you give us a hint
what this is about?

31:54.345 --> 31:56.575
You said it was urgent.

32:03.721 --> 32:08.158
The Nova members that escaped,
I know what they're planning.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.618
I know who their leader is.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.787
Okay.

32:14.899 --> 32:18.335
Shawn, I'm gonna need a name.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.242
Jordan Collier.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.781
You must think I'm insane.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.682
Only a psychopath
would declare war on the U.S. Army.

32:36.854 --> 32:38.321
Well, then we're all in agreement.

32:38.489 --> 32:40.150
I assure you, I am not crazy.

32:40.325 --> 32:43.522
I am not planning any attack
on a government installation.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.526
So you're saying
Shawn made all this up?

32:45.697 --> 32:48.962
Why would I do that?
Jordan, just tell the truth, okay?

32:49.133 --> 32:50.464
You can't cover this up.

32:50.902 --> 32:55.168
I told you a story, Shawn,
to see if you would pass it along.

32:55.773 --> 32:57.331
It was a test.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.476
And I'm afraid you failed.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.544
I've been away from this place
for a long time.

33:01.713 --> 33:05.080
In the days ahead,
I will be asking a lot of everyone here.

33:05.249 --> 33:08.082
I needed to know who I could trust.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.446
And who I couldn't.

33:09.620 --> 33:11.520
Sorry to embarrass you
like this, Shawn.

33:11.689 --> 33:13.156
It was the only way to be sure.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.189
And what about the breakout
at NTAC?

33:15.360 --> 33:16.725
You had nothing to do with that?

33:16.894 --> 33:19.692
- I did not.
- That is a lie! That's a lie!

33:19.864 --> 33:22.230
I saw Boyd Gelder
standing in this office

33:22.400 --> 33:23.924
with my own two eyes.

33:24.402 --> 33:27.166
Richard was here with me.
He saw him too. Richard?

33:28.940 --> 33:31.272
I don't know
what you're talking about, Shawn.

33:31.743 --> 33:32.869
Richard?

33:33.044 --> 33:37.071
As far as I know,
Boyd Gelder has never been here.

33:43.054 --> 33:46.114
So you're saying
in spite of all of Collier's denials,

33:46.290 --> 33:49.350
this base is still the subject
of a possible Nova attack?

33:49.527 --> 33:51.461
It's possible, yes.

33:51.629 --> 33:54.223
And you came all this way
to warn me?

33:54.399 --> 33:56.833
- I'm touched, Tom.
- Just doing my job, Dennis.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.434
It's nothing personal.

33:58.603 --> 34:01.299
Collier knows you're here,
so this place is no longer secure.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.463
Your little experiment
needs a new home.

34:03.641 --> 34:06.132
I say let them come. If Collier
wants a fight, we'll give him one.

34:06.310 --> 34:07.902
She's right, you know.

34:08.079 --> 34:09.876
Collier talks a good game.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.608
Unity, fighting together
to save the future.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.981
People actually believe he means it.
It's pathetic.

34:16.154 --> 34:19.554
But an attack will expose the 4400
for what they really are:

34:19.724 --> 34:23.216
The enemy.
You see, Tom? I was right all along.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.554
It comes down to survival.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.789
Us against them.

34:28.498 --> 34:31.592
You sure you wanna be at ground zero
for this one, Dennis?

34:32.270 --> 34:34.636
Defending the human race?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.105
Where else would I be?

34:39.177 --> 34:40.804
We're staying right here.

34:47.784 --> 34:52.016
How did it feel,
turning your back on me?

34:52.356 --> 34:54.722
I was just trying to save lives.

34:54.891 --> 34:56.882
Yours included.

34:58.029 --> 35:00.657
You know,
maybe if you'd told me everything,

35:00.832 --> 35:03.596
treated me with a little respect,
we could have worked things out.

35:03.768 --> 35:07.864
But, no, you were too busy
manipulating me like always.

35:09.407 --> 35:12.205
You know, Jordan,
while you were gone, I ran this place.

35:12.376 --> 35:15.573
And I did a pretty good job of it too.

35:16.414 --> 35:20.077
Now you're back. You and l?
It's like nothing's changed.

35:20.251 --> 35:23.982
You make all the decisions
and I play catch up five steps behind.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.180
It used to be ten.

35:27.825 --> 35:31.488
Shawn, I need you to believe in me.

35:32.897 --> 35:35.161
You know what I think, Jordan?

35:35.533 --> 35:38.024
I think that this whole messiah thing
has gone to your head.

35:38.202 --> 35:42.104
I'm no messiah.
More like John Brown.

35:42.273 --> 35:45.367
John Brown? Isn't he the guy
that tried to free all the slaves?

35:45.543 --> 35:48.512
He surrounded himself with people
who believed as he did,

35:48.679 --> 35:51.512
were willing to do anything
for their cause.

35:51.682 --> 35:54.810
And that kind of devotion
can change the world.

35:54.986 --> 35:57.784
They killed John Brown, Jordan.

35:59.423 --> 36:01.084
They killed me too.

36:09.467 --> 36:12.527
Mr. Ryland, I was told
we wouldn't be seeing you for a while.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.728
We have a security situation.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.806
NTAC intelligence has gotten word

36:16.974 --> 36:20.034
that Jordan Collier
may be planning a move against us.

36:20.211 --> 36:24.113
I wanna transfer all the promicin
out of Haspel Corp. for safekeeping.

36:24.282 --> 36:27.547
I want every vial packed and ready
for shipment as soon as possible.

36:27.718 --> 36:29.345
Yes, sir.

36:38.062 --> 36:40.587
Give us a hand here.
We've got a lot of crates to move.

36:40.765 --> 36:43.928
I want them loaded up
as soon as possible.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.541
We'll take it from here.

37:28.512 --> 37:31.276
The military base
was never Collier's target.

37:31.816 --> 37:33.784
He wanted to divert us
from his real goal.

37:33.951 --> 37:34.940
The promicin.

37:35.119 --> 37:37.451
Had enough stored to create
a whole army of enhanced soldiers.

37:37.622 --> 37:40.250
Before Collier's done, you'll wish
you had that army for protection.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.016
I wonder what he's gonna do
with all of it.

37:42.193 --> 37:45.060
Destroy it. He doesn't want
anyone else to develop abilities.

37:45.229 --> 37:47.493
He wants to keep us weak
so no one can fight back.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.132
Sounding a little paranoid, Dennis.

37:49.300 --> 37:50.858
Collier's a fanatic, Tom.

37:51.035 --> 37:53.868
He's capable of anything. You'll see.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.210
So you're saying
you wanna break up?

38:02.380 --> 38:04.405
I don't want to.

38:04.582 --> 38:06.573
Well, then let's not.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.786
Look, I know how bad you feel.

38:09.954 --> 38:14.789
I feel bad too,
but I also feel really good.

38:16.060 --> 38:17.891
Isn't that worth holding on to?
Trying at least?

38:18.062 --> 38:21.088
Well, I'm trying. Believe me.

38:21.966 --> 38:23.194
It is like we're never alone.

38:23.367 --> 38:27.303
There's you, me and April,
and she's the one crying.

38:28.039 --> 38:29.973
Yeah, I think I need to leave.

38:30.141 --> 38:33.076
Oh, great.
Now April and I are both crying.

38:33.244 --> 38:36.236
No. Look, I didn't mean for good.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.746
You can't get rid of me that easily.

38:40.284 --> 38:43.185
But I do have a job to do in London.

38:43.354 --> 38:46.050
It's five days, so it'll give us some time
to think things over.

38:46.223 --> 38:48.157
Five days?

38:48.326 --> 38:50.851
- Wanna come?
- No.

38:51.028 --> 38:52.757
Yes.

38:57.101 --> 38:59.262
Just leave. Please.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.904
Hey.

39:10.348 --> 39:11.940
I'll call you as soon as I get back,
okay?

39:17.955 --> 39:21.186
Oh, just so you know.

39:21.826 --> 39:24.386
Even if Maia
never made any prediction...

39:26.097 --> 39:28.395
...I'd still think
we're meant for each other.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.254
Hey, Kyle! Alana!

39:51.422 --> 39:54.755
Thomas.
I've been trying to reach you.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.950
- What is it? What's wrong?
- Kyle's leaving.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.926
- What?
- He's upstairs packing.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.235
- Kyle, what are you doing?
- Oh, I'm glad you're home.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.235
I would've hated to leave
without saying goodbye.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.930
Where are you going?

40:10.107 --> 40:12.575
Did Collier send that limo?

40:12.743 --> 40:14.233
I've got a job.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.505
I'm gonna travel around the country
for a little while.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.272
Hold these workshops
at the 4400 Centers.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.940
Talk about my life,
everything that's happened to me.

40:21.118 --> 40:24.087
- Spread the word.
- Kyle, can't you take a couple of days?

40:24.255 --> 40:26.348
You know, think this over?
We can talk about this.

40:26.524 --> 40:28.287
There's nothing to talk about.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.262
I'm gonna miss you, Dad,
but I gotta do this.

40:35.433 --> 40:36.991
I just got you home.

40:37.168 --> 40:40.035
You said I should move forward.
That's what I'm doing.

40:40.204 --> 40:41.899
Be happy for me.

40:42.139 --> 40:44.266
I'm trying, Kyle.

40:46.310 --> 40:47.834
I'm really trying.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.381
I gotta get going.

41:00.558 --> 41:02.856
I really gotta get going.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.263
Here.

41:08.265 --> 41:11.359
- Let me help you.
- Thanks, Dad.

41:46.604 --> 41:48.504
- It's beautiful.
- lsn't it?

41:49.340 --> 41:50.830
They're going to be looking for it.

41:51.008 --> 41:52.532
We gotta get rid of it soon.

41:52.710 --> 41:55.201
I don't understand.
Why take it at all?

41:55.746 --> 41:57.509
Why not just destroy it there?

41:58.415 --> 42:00.542
We're not going to destroy it.

42:02.753 --> 42:04.220
All right. I'll ask the question.

42:08.092 --> 42:12.256
What are we gonna do
with 1 7,432 units of promicin?

42:13.097 --> 42:14.928
We're going to give it away.

42:17.968 --> 42:19.458
To whom?

42:21.872 --> 42:23.806
To everyone.
