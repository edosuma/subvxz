[Werner] <i>We are here</i>
<i>in the Vanuatu Archipelago,</i>

02:09.920 --> 02:13.425
<i>a cluster of volcanic islands</i>
<i>in the Pacific,</i>

02:13.508 --> 02:17.763
<i>about 1,000 miles east</i>
<i>of northern Australia.</i>

02:19.765 --> 02:23.977
<i>Below, the village of Endu</i>
<i>on the island of Ambrym.</i>

02:25.062 --> 02:29.441
<i>A year ago, most of it was destroyed</i>
<i>by a tropical storm</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:31.360
<i>of phenomenal force.</i>

02:32.194 --> 02:36.114
<i>But the village also has to endure</i>
<i>to the periodic fallout</i>

02:36.198 --> 02:38.617
<i>of volcanic eruptions.</i>

02:38.700 --> 02:41.536
<i>Punctuated by catastrophes,</i>

02:41.620 --> 02:45.749
<i>time does not seem to have found a grip</i>
<i>on the community.</i>

02:49.711 --> 02:51.672
<i>We met Chief Mael Moses,</i>

02:51.755 --> 02:54.633
<i>here with members of his large family.</i>

02:57.094 --> 02:59.012
<i>This is Clive Oppenheimer,</i>

02:59.096 --> 03:02.265
<i>a volcanologist</i>
<i>from Cambridge University,</i>

03:02.349 --> 03:04.518
<i>who brought us to this place.</i>

03:05.185 --> 03:08.814
Chief Mael Moses, you're the head
of this beautiful village of Endu,

03:08.897 --> 03:11.733
just a few kilometers
from the volcano crater.

03:11.817 --> 03:17.197
You visited the crater
and looked yourself into the inferno,

03:17.280 --> 03:19.699
-into the raging fire.
-Yeah.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.160
How did you feel when you went there?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.871
Uh...

03:26.039 --> 03:29.960
I felt very frightened
to look at the fire.

03:32.003 --> 03:38.677
Secondly, I feel that I was not
in the island of Ambrym.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.762
I thought I was somewhere else.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.142
And, uh... the other thing,

03:45.225 --> 03:51.148
I feel that--
how powerful that fire is.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.611
[rumbling]

03:56.695 --> 03:59.156
[Clive]
<i>Do spirits live in the fire?</i>

04:00.282 --> 04:03.368
[Mael] <i>That's how we believe,</i>
<i>that spirits are in the fire.</i>

04:03.452 --> 04:07.706
<i>The fire is burning</i>
<i>through that spirit.</i>

04:09.040 --> 04:11.918
<i>We believe that the fire</i>
<i>is burning through that spirit.</i>

04:14.921 --> 04:20.427
I read that there was a big eruption
in 1968,

04:20.510 --> 04:25.265
and that there were rituals performed
to stop the eruption.

04:25.348 --> 04:30.187
And then tourists were not allowed
for three years afterwards

04:30.270 --> 04:32.105
to visit the crater

04:32.189 --> 04:36.067
because it was seen that somehow
the tourists had started the eruption.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.444
Is that...?

04:37.527 --> 04:42.365
Well, we believe that
because we thought that the spirits

04:42.449 --> 04:44.659
that are in the volcano...

04:44.743 --> 04:48.622
if they look at you,
they don't know who is this. Okay?

04:48.705 --> 04:52.292
But if they look at one of us,
they know that, uh,

04:52.375 --> 04:55.879
because we are more or less
related to the volcano,

04:55.962 --> 04:58.965
then they will just be quiet.

04:59.883 --> 05:04.513
Sometimes we say that tourists
won't go up there. Okay?

05:04.596 --> 05:09.601
Because you are foreigners
to that spirit, the volcano.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.144
[chuckles]

05:13.522 --> 05:19.694
<i>Once I dreamt about volcano,</i>
<i>I saw people in that fire.</i>

05:21.488 --> 05:23.990
<i>People and women and men.</i>

05:24.074 --> 05:26.451
<i>They're cooking their food in there.</i>

05:26.535 --> 05:30.080
<i>So, it makes me believe</i>
<i>that there is somebody who is--</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:31.790
<i>their spirits are there.</i>

05:34.376 --> 05:37.087
[Clive] <i>The molten rock,</i>
<i>is that part of the spirit?</i>

05:38.421 --> 05:43.927
[Mael] <i>The lava expresses</i>
<i>the anger of the devil</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:46.972
<i>who are living in that fire, volcano.</i>

05:51.768 --> 05:55.814
Do the ancestors, then,
live under the volcano?

05:55.897 --> 06:01.736
Yes, we believe that anybody who dies here
goes to the volcano,

06:01.820 --> 06:05.365
and that volcano has become their village,

06:05.448 --> 06:09.869
where you can talk to them
and they can talk to us.

06:10.787 --> 06:14.541
-Can you talk to the volcano?
-I'm not, because, you know,

06:14.624 --> 06:16.960
I'm not related to the volcano.

06:17.043 --> 06:22.132
But one of my brothers is.
He was talking to the volcano.

06:22.215 --> 06:28.680
His father-- His father,
when he goes up to the volcano,

06:28.763 --> 06:32.475
and if he wants to smoke,
he just calls out

06:32.559 --> 06:35.520
and the fire will come down,
and take the fire

06:35.604 --> 06:39.649
and light his cigarette or pipe
or something like that.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.068
And if you brother talks to the volcano,

06:42.152 --> 06:44.988
is he allowed to tell you
what the volcano has said,

06:45.071 --> 06:48.742
-or is it just a secret?
-No, it's a secret for him. Yes.

06:48.825 --> 06:51.911
-Do you try and get the secret out of him?
-I've got some.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.496

[Werner]
<i>But Chief Mael Moses is worried</i>

06:58.209 --> 07:01.004
<i>about the loss of their ancient culture.</i>

07:01.087 --> 07:05.675
<i>He asked us to follow him</i>
<i>to a ritual site in the jungle.</i>

07:05.759 --> 07:08.094
[villagers shouting]

07:10.805 --> 07:15.352
Once upon a time,
our people were cannibal.

07:15.435 --> 07:20.315
They see somebody,
and they would like to attack him

07:20.398 --> 07:24.069
and kill him
so that they use it for meat.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.404
And this how they demonstrate it.

[Mael] <i>Many people here</i>

07:52.931 --> 07:57.602
<i>They have lost the idea of dancing.</i>

<i>Yes.</i>

[drums playing, singing continues]

09:40.622 --> 09:43.958
I studied here ten years ago
with some colleagues,

09:44.042 --> 09:45.835
scientists from Vanuatu.

09:45.919 --> 09:50.215
For you, is it strange to imagine
that someone would come here to work,

09:50.298 --> 09:53.718
to study how the volcano works,
how it erupts?

09:54.636 --> 09:59.390
I'm very surprised to hear
that you people are very interested

09:59.474 --> 10:01.810
in the volcano. Yeah.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.479
I always ask myself,

10:04.562 --> 10:08.691
"Why do these people
want to do with that fire?"

10:08.775 --> 10:11.736
Okay?
[chuckles]

10:11.820 --> 10:16.741
When looking at this,
going in the helicopter yesterday,

10:16.825 --> 10:19.994
I was wondering,
"Why this man is going--

10:20.078 --> 10:23.665
wanting to do with that volcano, eh?"

10:23.748 --> 10:26.417
-[chuckles]
-[rooster crows nearby]

10:28.920 --> 10:32.841
Yes, I don't know why
you are so interested in volcano.

[Werner] <i>In a way, this film started</i>
<i>for me ten years ago in Antarctica.</i>

10:40.640 --> 10:44.227
<i>I was doing a film about scientists</i>
<i>on this continent</i>

10:44.310 --> 10:48.064
<i>which took me to Mount Erebus,</i>
<i>an active volcano,</i>

10:48.148 --> 10:50.108
<i>one of the three in the world</i>

10:50.191 --> 10:54.112
<i>where you can look straight</i>
<i>into the magma of the inner earth.</i>

10:55.613 --> 11:00.785
<i>Magma is the heated molten rock</i>
<i>from which lava can be extruded.</i>

11:01.744 --> 11:06.207
<i>It was on Erebus,</i>
<i>12,500 feet above sea level,</i>

11:06.291 --> 11:10.503
<i>that I met a strange and wonderful tribe</i>
<i>of volcanologists,</i>

11:10.587 --> 11:13.756
<i>some of them overcome</i>

11:22.557 --> 11:26.686
<i>This close to the boiling magma,</i>
<i>which frequently explodes,</i>

11:26.769 --> 11:31.524
<i>we were briefed on the etiquette</i>

11:33.026 --> 11:35.570
[man] <i>One very important thing</i>

11:35.653 --> 11:37.197
<i>when you're on the crater</i>

11:37.280 --> 11:40.992
<i>is that the lava lake</i>
<i>could explode at any time.</i>

11:41.075 --> 11:45.371
If it does, it's vital
to keep your attention

11:45.455 --> 11:46.831
faced toward the lava lake

11:46.915 --> 11:51.127
and watch for bombs
that are tracking up into the air,

11:51.210 --> 11:54.464
and try to pick out the ones
that might be coming toward you

11:54.547 --> 11:56.257
and step out of the way.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.510
The last thing you want to do
is turn away from the crater

11:59.594 --> 12:01.638
or run or crouch down.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.307
Keep your attention toward the lava lake,
look up,

Let's turn it off, yeah? Okay?

13:37.316 --> 13:41.112
Do you see them

No, I... I do not. Uh...

13:47.493 --> 13:49.954
Something different.
It's good that they are there.

<i>no permanence to art,</i>
<i>no permanence to science.</i>

<i>There is something of a crust</i>
<i>that is somehow moving,</i>

14:12.477 --> 14:18.274
<i>and it makes me fond of the volcano</i>
<i>to know that our life,</i>

14:18.358 --> 14:21.194
<i>human life, or animals,</i>

14:21.277 --> 14:23.905
<i>can only live and survive</i>

Do you have a sense of the different kinds

14:31.829 --> 14:36.793
I know you filmed on
La Soufrière de Guadeloupe many years ago,

14:38.378 --> 14:43.007
Well, do you sense differences
in the activity here with...?

14:43.091 --> 14:46.177
Yeah, La Soufrière was very volatile.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.304
[classical music playing]

14:49.347 --> 14:52.517
[Werner]
<i>It was all the way back in 1976</i>

14:52.600 --> 14:55.353
<i>when I first filmed a volcano.</i>

14:55.436 --> 14:58.815
<i>This was on the Caribbean island</i>
<i>of Guadeloupe.</i>

15:00.108 --> 15:03.820
<i>The mountain was expected to explode</i>
<i>at any moment,</i>

15:03.903 --> 15:07.532
<i>and 70,000 people</i>
<i>were rapidly evacuated.</i>

15:07.615 --> 15:09.951
[donkey braying]

15:10.410 --> 15:12.245
<i>The fear was intense</i>

15:12.328 --> 15:17.667
<i>because of the memory of an event</i>
<i>that took on apocalyptic proportions.</i>

15:18.793 --> 15:21.921
<i>It was known that, in 1902,</i>

15:22.004 --> 15:26.717
<i>on the neighboring island of Martinique,</i>
<i>Mount Pelée exploded.</i>

15:26.801 --> 15:32.890
The signals that La Soufrière issued
in Guadeloupe

15:32.974 --> 15:36.894
were almost identical
to what had happened.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.272
It was measured in 1902.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.607
So, everybody was afraid
it would explode,

15:41.691 --> 15:45.528
and it would explode
with very, very massive force,

15:45.611 --> 15:49.991
many times an atomic bomb,
Hiroshima-size.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.910
So, I was not interested in the volcano.

15:52.994 --> 15:57.039
I was interested in one single man
who refused to be evacuated.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.082
Uh-huh.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.626
A different attitude towards death.

16:00.710 --> 16:05.339
75 people--
75,000 people being evacuated,

16:05.423 --> 16:06.799
and he stayed on.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.719
I actually found him--
I find him sleeping.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.473
<i>I find him sleeping.</i>
<i>I had to wake him up on camera.</i>

16:16.225 --> 16:18.686
<i>And what was wonderful--</i>
<i>he was very philosophical.</i>

16:18.769 --> 16:20.980
<i>A very poor black farmer.</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:23.024
<i>And I sensed that, after a while,</i>

16:23.107 --> 16:26.569
<i>he didn't feel so comfortable</i>
<i>with us anymore,</i>

16:26.652 --> 16:31.991
<i>and he sat up and started</i>
<i>to tie his worn-out tennis shoe.</i>

16:32.074 --> 16:35.578
<i>And then, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>he sings a song against the camera,</i>

16:35.661 --> 16:39.123
<i>and I knew that was that.</i>
<i>So, go away, we'd better get out.</i>

during the shoot
of <i>Encounters at the End of the World,</i>

17:00.144 --> 17:03.940

17:04.022 --> 17:06.692

17:06.776 --> 17:09.862

17:09.945 --> 17:13.074
And we, in our field team,

17:13.156 --> 17:18.871
<i>we were anxious that you were going</i>
<i>to have us propelled</i>

17:18.954 --> 17:20.748
<i>down towards the lava lake.</i>

17:20.830 --> 17:25.044
<i>There was some concern that you would be</i>
<i>looking for lengths of rope</i>

17:25.127 --> 17:28.422
<i>with which we could be lowered down</i>
<i>within meters of this fiery lake</i>

17:28.506 --> 17:30.341
<i>on Mount Erebus, volcano.</i>

17:30.800 --> 17:36.889
And instead, you were interested
in what we were doing

17:36.973 --> 17:38.766
and why we were doing it.

17:38.849 --> 17:43.437
For me, there is no personal excitement
to go down.

17:43.521 --> 17:47.733
There's a curiosity.
Yes, I would love to see it from close up.

17:48.484 --> 17:51.862
But since it is too dangerous,
it would be silly.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.365
We have, in some ways, similar...

17:54.448 --> 17:57.243
Um, you know, we both--
As a volcanologist,

17:57.326 --> 17:59.620
of course, there's a risk
doing the measurements,

17:59.704 --> 18:04.792
and you ask yourself, "Well, is it worth
dying to get this measurement?"

18:04.875 --> 18:08.087
And the answer is no,
if you look at it in those terms.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.673
But you're always trying to evaluate

18:10.756 --> 18:13.009
how far you're going
to tolerate the risk.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.678
I mean, even here,
the volcano could explode now

18:15.761 --> 18:18.848
and we could all be hit
by one of these five-meter bombs.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.560
[Werner] I'm the only one in filmmaking
who is clinically sane,

18:22.643 --> 18:25.396
-taking all precautions.
-That's very clear. Oh, absolutely.

18:25.479 --> 18:28.482
I mean, you wouldn't still be here
if you were insane.

18:28.566 --> 18:32.486
You would've been consumed long ago
by a pyroclastic current

18:32.570 --> 18:36.532
or a gas flare or a grizzly bear
or whatever.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.743
So, it's quite clear that you're sane.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.872
I never doubted that for a moment
from our first encounter.

18:43.497 --> 18:47.126
Deposited out from the volcanic gas.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.670
Very nice.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.213
[whooshing, rumbling]

18:51.297 --> 18:54.008
-That's a good swoosh.
-Yeah, a good swoosh.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.263
-We're very blasé about all of this.
-Yes.

19:00.431 --> 19:04.935
But let it come at us.
We'll face it and step aside.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.608
[Werner] <i>We would often discuss</i>
<i>the life and work of a French couple,</i>

19:10.691 --> 19:13.027
<i>Katia and Maurice Krafft.</i>

19:14.028 --> 19:18.449
<i>They were famous for capturing</i>
<i>incredible images of volcanoes.</i>

19:21.202 --> 19:26.040
<i>But this meant that they had to get</i>
<i>dangerously close to their subject.</i>

19:26.123 --> 19:30.044
<i>Too close,</i>
<i>as it would eventually turn out.</i>

19:30.127 --> 19:32.213
[opera music playing]

20:04.870 --> 20:06.914
[rumbling, crashing]

21:13.773 --> 21:18.319

<i>by a pyroclastic flow in Japan,</i>

21:18.402 --> 21:21.155
<i>together with 41 other people.</i>

21:27.453 --> 21:32.374
<i>This is the very avalanche</i>
<i>of super-heated gases that killed them.</i>

21:32.458 --> 21:37.046
<i>What is rushing down this slope</i>
<i>at over 100 miles per hour</i>

21:37.129 --> 21:41.217

22:04.490 --> 22:07.493
-[bugs chirping]
-[birds calling]

22:10.329 --> 22:13.332
[Clive] <i>I spent a very formative part</i>
<i>of my youth in Indonesia.</i>

22:13.415 --> 22:17.044
<i>I came to Toba</i>
<i>when I was 19 years old.</i>

22:17.127 --> 22:20.256
And actually, in Indonesia,
I feel like it's my second home.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.133
I've come back
intermittently over the years,

22:23.217 --> 22:25.177
but I immediately feel at home.

22:25.261 --> 22:29.974
The smell of the kretek clove cigarettes,
the sights, the sounds.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.476
It's a very special place to me.

22:32.560 --> 22:36.647
And I think my career as a volcanologist

22:36.730 --> 22:41.235
was partly formed from that first visit
as a 19-year-old.

22:42.027 --> 22:46.240
[Werner] <i>Indonesia was the right place</i>
<i>for an aspiring scientist.</i>

22:46.323 --> 22:52.705
<i>In fact, there's no country in the world</i>
<i>that has more volcanoes than this one.</i>

22:52.788 --> 22:55.791
<i>Clive Oppenheimer took us</i>
<i>to Mount Sinabung.</i>

22:56.542 --> 23:00.087
<i>It had been relatively quiet</i>
<i>the last few years.</i>

23:00.170 --> 23:01.505
[low rumbling]

23:01.589 --> 23:06.844
<i>The area we are shooting in right now</i>
<i>had been declared a restricted zone,</i>

23:06.927 --> 23:10.097
<i>with no access allowed to anyone.</i>

23:10.180 --> 23:15.352
<i>But, as we found farmers working there,</i>
<i>we felt reasonably safe.</i>

23:16.604 --> 23:21.775
<i>Eerie relics remained, though,</i>
<i>from an eruption in 2010.</i>

23:23.819 --> 23:26.947
<i>Feeling that this was</i>
<i>distant enough in time,</i>

23:27.031 --> 23:30.492
<i>no one was expecting</i>
<i>what happened next.</i>

23:33.871 --> 23:36.790
[echoing booms, rumbling]

24:18.082 --> 24:21.585
<i>Fortunately, this eruption</i>
<i>did not hurt anyone,</i>

24:21.669 --> 24:24.296
<i>and we quickly left the area.</i>

24:30.219 --> 24:31.679
[indistinct radio chatter]

24:31.762 --> 24:36.475
[Werner] <i> Only a few days later,</i>
<i>we saw this on Indonesian television.</i>

24:37.142 --> 24:41.814
<i>Seven people were killed in the very spot</i>
<i>where we had had our camera.</i>

24:41.897 --> 24:44.358
[people shouting]

24:44.441 --> 24:47.778
[sirens wailing,
helicopter blades whirring]

24:47.861 --> 24:50.072
[shouting continues]

24:55.703 --> 24:57.913
[helicopter flying overhead]

25:06.797 --> 25:09.717
<i>In order to prevent such catastrophes,</i>

25:09.800 --> 25:14.263
<i>Indonesia has set up</i>
<i>numerous early warning systems.</i>

25:14.346 --> 25:17.099
<i>This is the Babadan Observatory,</i>

25:17.182 --> 25:19.351
<i>which monitors Mount Merapi,</i>

25:19.435 --> 25:23.272
<i>one of the most dangerous volcanoes</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

25:24.231 --> 25:28.819
And each of these stations
is a seismometer somewhere on Merapi,

25:28.902 --> 25:32.281
a different distance,
five, six kilometers from the summit?

25:32.364 --> 25:38.203
Yeah, that's true.
So, we have a summit station.

25:38.287 --> 25:41.081
We have a short east station,

25:41.165 --> 25:44.793
we have short station in Babadan Hill.

25:44.877 --> 25:49.173
And also we have on the west of station.

25:49.256 --> 25:54.470
And these real-time data provide
one of the most important parts

25:54.553 --> 25:59.016
of a volcano-monitoring program
for assessing what the volcano is doing.

25:59.099 --> 26:01.643
-It's the heartbeat of the volcano.
-Exactly.

26:01.727 --> 26:06.273
This one is the electronic
distance measurements.

26:06.356 --> 26:11.487
So, we have a reflector
in the summit of Merapi.

26:11.570 --> 26:15.365
Then we're measuring every morning.

26:15.908 --> 26:19.620
By this measuring,
we're plotting the cone.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.289
So, it's measuring--
It's firing a laser pulse

26:22.372 --> 26:25.125
to a mirror five, six kilometers away,

26:25.209 --> 26:27.795
the light bounces back
and you've measured the distance.

26:27.878 --> 26:31.882
And that can show
whether the volcano is inflating

26:31.965 --> 26:35.511
because magma is rising into the cone.
Is that--

26:35.594 --> 26:41.600
That's right. That's the idea
for the electronic distance measurements.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.977
In a worst-case scenario,

26:44.061 --> 26:48.315
I imagine the observer is at risk
if there's a pyroclastic flow.

26:48.398 --> 26:51.193
If it's too late
for the observer to evacuate,

26:51.276 --> 26:53.195
are there any options left?

26:53.278 --> 26:55.739
Yeah, that's the emergency.

26:55.823 --> 26:59.076
Then, if it is emergency,
we have a bunker.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.954
It's a thick door.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.539
-Yeah.
-After you.

27:04.832 --> 27:08.001
[Sri]
<i>We put the food and also oxygen.</i>

27:08.085 --> 27:12.256
<i>We hope that they can survive</i>
<i>for one month.</i>

27:13.549 --> 27:18.762
It reminds me of the eruption
of Mount Pelée in 1902

27:18.846 --> 27:22.141
that killed nearly 30,000 people
in the city of Saint-Pierre

27:22.224 --> 27:25.853
as the pyroclastic flows reached it.

27:26.353 --> 27:31.275
And the only survivor lived
because he was the baddest guy in town.

27:31.358 --> 27:35.070
<i>He was a criminal.</i>
<i>I think he stabbed a prison officer</i>

27:35.153 --> 27:37.197
<i>through the cheek with a pencil,</i>

27:37.281 --> 27:41.660
<i>and he was put in solitary confinement</i>
<i>in a bunker-like cell.</i>

27:41.743 --> 27:45.163
<i>All the other prisoners perished,</i>
<i>but he survived,</i>

27:45.247 --> 27:49.376
<i>albeit badly burnt, because there was</i>
<i>a tiny grill window in the cell,</i>

27:49.459 --> 27:53.005
<i>and he subsequently joined</i>
<i>the Barnum & Bailey Circus</i>

27:53.088 --> 27:55.757
<i>and was exhibited as a celebrity,</i>

27:55.841 --> 27:58.468
<i>as the sole survivor of this eruption.</i>

27:59.344 --> 28:01.138
[booming]

28:09.646 --> 28:14.067
<i>So, in 2010, the monitoring</i>
<i>was absolutely crucial</i>

28:14.151 --> 28:18.363
<i>in forecasting the eruption</i>
<i>and its escalation.</i>

28:18.447 --> 28:21.700
[Sri]
<i>The first indication was seismic.</i>

28:21.783 --> 28:25.204
<i>A lot of volcanic earthquakes.</i>

28:26.038 --> 28:29.458
This indicates that there is magma moving.

28:29.541 --> 28:34.296
Also, supported by these electronic
distance measurements.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.672
And the gas measurements?

28:35.756 --> 28:36.965
Of course. [chuckles]

28:38.008 --> 28:40.552
I know this looks pathetic,
like a shoebox

28:40.636 --> 28:43.055
with a baked bean tin stuck on the end,

28:43.138 --> 28:45.182
and it also looks
like it's pointing at the ground,

28:45.265 --> 28:47.768
rather than at the volcano summit
over here.

28:47.851 --> 28:51.230
But it's something I'm very proud of.
It's something that we built in Cambridge.

28:51.313 --> 28:55.025
There's a little window here,
and a mirror and some lenses,

28:55.108 --> 28:57.319
connected to an ultraviolet spectrometer.

28:57.402 --> 29:01.949
The device measures the emissions
of sulfur dioxide from the volcano

29:02.032 --> 29:05.244
as the gases rise above the summit,

29:05.327 --> 29:07.537
and this is a very important parameter

29:07.621 --> 29:10.874
in many volcano-monitoring programs
around the world.

29:10.958 --> 29:15.587
And the forerunner of this device
we had working here in 2010,

29:15.671 --> 29:20.050
and it played an important role
in the hazard assessment,

29:20.133 --> 29:24.721
and it's conservatively estimated
at something like 20,000 lives were saved

29:24.805 --> 29:27.849
<i>because of the effective monitoring</i>
<i>of Merapi in 2010</i>

29:27.933 --> 29:30.143
<i>and the evacuation that followed.</i>

29:37.025 --> 29:38.110
[speaks Indonesian]

29:38.193 --> 29:41.071
I'm very happy to see
that it's still working. Uh...

29:41.154 --> 29:46.535
I hold, along with some colleagues,
the patent for the original prototype,

29:46.618 --> 29:49.288
which we designed
more than ten years ago now.

29:49.371 --> 29:53.458
So, this technology is now found
on volcanoes around the world,

29:53.542 --> 29:58.088
and it's revolutionized the monitoring
of gas emissions from volcanoes.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.426
It's my baby.
I'm really glad to see it.

30:02.509 --> 30:05.929
I haven't seen it for two years,
and here it is, still working.

30:08.432 --> 30:12.185
[bell pealing]

30:12.269 --> 30:16.481
[Werner] <i>Obviously, there was</i>
<i>a scientific side to our journey.</i>

30:16.565 --> 30:20.777
<i>But what we were really chasing</i>
<i>was the magical side:</i>

30:20.861 --> 30:23.572
<i>the demons, the new gods.</i>

30:24.406 --> 30:28.368
<i>This was the itinerary</i>
<i>we had set for ourselves,</i>

30:28.452 --> 30:32.205
<i>no matter how strange</i>
<i>things might eventually get.</i>

30:33.582 --> 30:37.419
<i>Here in the palace</i>
<i>of the Sultan of Jogjakarta,</i>

<i>dignitaries are charged with the task</i>
<i>of reconciling the goddess of the ocean</i>

<i>with the demon of the volcano.</i>

<i>The sultan himself does not participate</i>
<i>in the procession.</i>

30:52.809 --> 30:58.065
<i>We marveled at his parked Mercedes,</i>
<i>wrapped in a bubble of plastic,</i>

<i>as if the conceptual artist Christo</i>
<i>had just been here.</i>

31:05.864 --> 31:07.741
[soft bell music playing]

31:11.703 --> 31:15.874
<i>The procession stops for a ritual</i>
<i>close to the ocean.</i>

31:15.957 --> 31:19.628
<i>This will be a reenactment</i>
<i>of the sexual union</i>

31:19.711 --> 31:24.174
<i>between an ancient sultan</i>
<i>and the Queen of the Sea.</i>

31:24.257 --> 31:28.095
<i>A doctoral student of Clive's,</i>
<i>Adam Bobbette,</i>

31:28.178 --> 31:30.263
<i>functioned as our guide.</i>

31:30.347 --> 31:35.018
Every year, they have to reproduce this
by giving rituals--

31:35.102 --> 31:38.605
by doing rituals in this site
and then giving offerings

31:38.688 --> 31:43.026
to the South Sea from the sultan,
including his body parts--

31:43.110 --> 31:46.446
fingernails, hair, clothes--

31:46.530 --> 31:51.535
which they launch into the ocean
to appease the Queen of the South Sea.

31:51.618 --> 31:54.496
As a part of their sexual union,

31:54.579 --> 31:58.083
they also created a kind of monster

31:58.166 --> 32:01.711
that ended up occupying the volcano.

32:02.712 --> 32:06.883
So, this hole is where
they will give offerings,

32:06.967 --> 32:09.970
because this is the site
of the sexual union

32:10.053 --> 32:13.181
between the Goddess of the Sea
and the first sultan.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.768
I think it's coming right now.
It's a box.

32:16.852 --> 32:18.228
This is it.

32:29.948 --> 32:33.368
[Werner]
<i>And now the offerings to the ocean.</i>

[speaking Indonesian] Yes, I am one of

34:49.045 --> 34:52.549
What is it?
What are you building?

34:52.632 --> 34:56.719
I built this.

34:57.762 --> 35:04.436
The owner had a dream.
After that, he built this building.

35:04.519 --> 35:10.942
A building to be used for prayer.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.780
It looks like a chicken?

35:15.864 --> 35:18.575
It's actually a dove, not a chicken.

35:18.658 --> 35:25.498
But maybe it's also related to Merapi?

35:25.582 --> 35:27.542
[overlapping chatter]

35:27.626 --> 35:33.757
Maybe the owner thinks that way,
pointing it towards Mount Merapi.

35:33.840 --> 35:38.595
I'm only an ordinary worker

35:38.678 --> 35:42.557
who goes home after working hours.

35:42.641 --> 35:48.480
But it still looks like a chicken, right?

35:48.563 --> 35:52.692
Yes, most people say
it's like a chicken.

35:52.776 --> 35:56.321
They call it the Chicken Church.

35:56.404 --> 36:02.786
-A soap opera filmed a scene here.
-Yes.

36:04.120 --> 36:09.125
<i>It became popular</i>
<i>after the soap opera was shot.</i>

36:09.209 --> 36:15.965
<i>Last Saturday, someone from Surabaya</i>
<i>who saw the show,</i>

36:16.049 --> 36:22.931
<i>wanted to see the location,</i>
<i>so they came here.</i>

36:27.102 --> 36:31.731
[Werner] <i>Odder still is the fact that,</i>
<i>in this mostly Muslim country,</i>

36:31.815 --> 36:34.359
<i>this is a Roman Catholic church.</i>

36:35.318 --> 36:39.489
<i>Under the floor,</i>
<i>it even has its own catacombs,</i>

36:39.572 --> 36:42.033
<i>maybe as a shelter for hermits,</i>

36:42.117 --> 36:45.036
<i>as protection against volcanic fallout.</i>

36:45.120 --> 36:47.539
[construction noise echoing]

37:15.942 --> 37:17.861
[thunder rumbling]

37:17.944 --> 37:20.697
[opera music playing]

37:28.371 --> 37:31.666
<i>Of all the many volcanoes</i>
<i>in Indonesia,</i>

37:31.750 --> 37:34.961
<i>there is no single one</i>
<i>that is not connected</i>

37:35.044 --> 37:36.880
<i>to a belief system.</i>

37:39.382 --> 37:42.635
<i>For the locals,</i>
<i>all this volcanic landscape</i>

37:42.719 --> 37:45.263
<i>bears magical names.</i>

37:45.346 --> 37:47.807
<i>The Night Market of the Ghosts,</i>

37:47.891 --> 37:49.893
<i>the Flying Foxes,</i>

37:49.976 --> 37:53.271
<i>the Dancing Place of the Spirits.</i>

38:30.475 --> 38:32.143
<i>Back to Lake Toba,</i>

38:32.227 --> 38:36.147
<i>where Clive Oppenheimer's</i>
<i>scientific journey began.</i>

38:37.857 --> 38:40.860
[Clive] <i>This is the largest</i>
<i>volcanic crater lake on Earth.</i>

38:40.944 --> 38:44.405
It extends something like 100 kilometers
off into the distance.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.032
Frankly, it's too big to film.

38:46.115 --> 38:48.952
We should've booked a ticket
on the International Space Station

38:49.035 --> 38:52.372
<i>to look down from above</i>
<i>and appreciate its vast scale.</i>

38:53.957 --> 38:57.710
<i>The eruption occurred</i>
<i>something like 74,000 years ago.</i>

38:58.711 --> 39:02.632
This was a monstrous,
stupendous volcanic eruption,

39:02.715 --> 39:04.884
one of the very largest
that we've documented

39:04.968 --> 39:07.679
in all of Earth history
for a single event.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.639
<i>The skies would've been darkened,</i>

39:09.722 --> 39:13.810
<i>there would've been a conflagration</i>
<i>across this part of Northern Sumatra</i>

39:13.893 --> 39:18.982
<i>as the pyroclastic currents spread out</i>
<i>radially around the crater,</i>

39:19.065 --> 39:22.610
<i>igniting all of the tropical vegetation.</i>

39:22.694 --> 39:28.199
The eruption produced something like
15,000 cubic kilometers of ash and pumice

39:28.283 --> 39:31.744
that was pumped
high into the stratosphere

39:31.828 --> 39:33.872
and spread across the globe.

39:33.955 --> 39:40.420
Enough pumice came out to bury everyone
in the United States to head-height.

39:40.795 --> 39:43.798
It's something like 10,000 times larger

39:43.882 --> 39:46.175
than the 1980 eruption
of Mount St. Helens.

39:46.259 --> 39:48.636
It's 100,000 times greater

39:48.720 --> 39:52.140
than the Eyjafjallajökull eruption
in Iceland in 2010

39:52.223 --> 39:54.267
that disrupted global aviation.

39:54.350 --> 39:58.313
This was the stupendous event
in Earth history.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.107
And there's even a theory
that the eruption

40:01.190 --> 40:03.151
almost wiped us out as a species.

40:03.234 --> 40:07.155
Based on the genetic pedigree
of living humans,

40:07.238 --> 40:12.827
we can say that there was a bottleneck
in human numbers around this time period.

40:13.912 --> 40:18.291
And the link is between the climate change
wrought by the eruption,

40:18.374 --> 40:20.752
the decimation of tropical vegetation

40:20.835 --> 40:23.796
that was the resource base
for our ancestors.

40:24.714 --> 40:29.302
Perhaps there were as few as 600
of our species left on Earth.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.971
We would've been classified
as an endangered species.

40:32.055 --> 40:33.681
Somehow, we rebounded.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.685
This theory is very controversial,
however.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.813
And that's because there's
a very limited amount of evidence

40:40.897 --> 40:42.106
this far back in time.

40:42.190 --> 40:45.068
In particular,
there are very few human fossils

40:45.151 --> 40:47.111
to try and establish cause and effect.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.740
If we want to find human fossils
from 74,000 years ago,

40:50.823 --> 40:54.702
we'd better go to Ethiopia,
we'd better go to the Afar Region.

40:58.122 --> 41:01.250
[Werner] <i>This is part</i>
<i>of the Danakil Depression,</i>

41:01.334 --> 41:03.962
<i>300 feet below sea level.</i>

41:04.545 --> 41:07.632
<i>In terms of average</i>
<i>year-round temperature,</i>

41:07.715 --> 41:10.760
<i>this is the hottest place on our planet.</i>

41:12.136 --> 41:13.262
<i>During summer,</i>

41:13.346 --> 41:18.309
<i>temperatures hardly ever dip</i>
<i>below 120 degrees Fahrenheit.</i>

41:19.435 --> 41:23.147
<i>Working conditions are only tolerable</i>
<i>in mid-winter,</i>

41:23.231 --> 41:26.401
<i>and even then it is extremely hot.</i>

41:28.069 --> 41:32.156
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>this is an area of tribal warfare,</i>

41:32.240 --> 41:36.828
<i>and you can only enter it</i>
<i>accompanied by armed soldiers.</i>

41:47.380 --> 41:51.384
<i>This depression is only part</i>
<i>of a long, stretched rift,</i>

41:51.467 --> 41:54.554
<i>continuing down</i>
<i>through all of East Africa.</i>

41:55.638 --> 41:58.850
<i>In millions of years,</i>
<i>the rift will widen</i>

41:58.933 --> 42:01.936
<i>until a strip of the continent</i>
<i>breaks off,</i>

42:02.020 --> 42:04.439
<i>drifting into the Indian Ocean.</i>

42:06.607 --> 42:09.569
<i>In such places, volcanoes form.</i>

42:11.404 --> 42:14.532
<i>This particular one, Erta Ale,</i>

42:14.615 --> 42:18.870
<i>is one of the three in the world</i>
<i>where magma is directly exposed.</i>

42:18.953 --> 42:20.747
[rumbling]

42:45.813 --> 42:50.443
<i>Erta Ale is also important</i>
<i>for its significance to early man.</i>

42:51.152 --> 42:55.448
<i>A great amount of obsidian,</i>
<i>a volcanic glass,</i>

42:55.531 --> 42:57.575
<i>was extruded from the crater.</i>

43:00.870 --> 43:04.373
Look at that.
It's translucent at the edges.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.959
Beautiful flake.

43:10.088 --> 43:13.841
And very sharp still.
You could probably shave with that.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.512
[Werner]
<i>Obsidian is very hard and brittle,</i>

43:17.595 --> 43:21.224
<i>and therefore fractures</i>
<i>with extremely sharp edges.</i>

43:21.891 --> 43:25.895
<i>So sharp, in fact,</i>
<i>that up until the 1980s</i>

43:25.978 --> 43:30.233
<i>eye operations were performed</i>
<i>with obsidian scalpels,</i>

43:30.316 --> 43:32.360
<i>sharper than any steel.</i>

43:34.695 --> 43:39.992
<i>This amazing material has attracted</i>
<i>early humans to this landscape</i>

43:40.076 --> 43:43.913
<i>as far back as hominids</i>
<i>a million years ago.</i>

43:44.831 --> 43:46.707
[indistinct chatter]

43:46.791 --> 43:50.002
<i>At this site,</i>
<i>a team of paleontologists</i>

43:50.086 --> 43:54.841
<i>are extracting artifacts and remains</i>
<i>of our direct ancestors,</i>

43:54.924 --> 43:56.968
<i>the first </i> Homo sapiens,

43:57.051 --> 44:01.097
<i>who emerged in this area</i>

44:04.016 --> 44:08.146
<i>What is amazing to me is the fact</i>
<i>that the remains are found</i>

44:08.229 --> 44:10.523
<i>almost directly at the surface.</i>

44:10.606 --> 44:14.110
<i>And more so,</i>
<i>why this particular spot</i>

44:14.193 --> 44:17.488
<i>and not back there</i>
<i>where the goats are roaming?</i>

44:21.659 --> 44:25.872
<i>This grid was apparently</i>
<i>a tool manufacturing site.</i>

44:25.955 --> 44:29.542
<i>Hundreds of obsidian chips</i>
<i>are strewn about.</i>

44:30.877 --> 44:34.797
<i>Dr. Yonatan Sahle,</i>
<i>an Ethiopian scientist,</i>

44:34.881 --> 44:38.301
<i>has excavated this prehistoric workshop.</i>

44:39.051 --> 44:43.514
And where did your passion come from?
How did you fall into this field?

44:43.598 --> 44:48.978
Well, I had-- I studied history
for my bachelor's degree.

44:49.061 --> 44:52.106
And that's when
I started to fall in love.

44:52.189 --> 44:54.567
So, history was not deep enough for me.

44:54.650 --> 44:57.987
I wanted to look further back in time

44:58.070 --> 45:02.617
and find out what is it, really,
that makes us human.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.744
We are a very unique species.

45:04.827 --> 45:08.581
In a way, we interact
and we collaborate

45:08.664 --> 45:12.752
and we cooperate and we produce,
we modify our environment.

45:12.835 --> 45:15.796
But at the same time,
we fight and destruct,

45:15.880 --> 45:19.759
and we are even a danger
to other species and the planet,

45:19.842 --> 45:21.761
the fate of the planet as well.

45:21.844 --> 45:23.763
So, we are a very interesting species.

45:23.846 --> 45:27.183
So, I wanted to get at the root
of all this

45:27.266 --> 45:32.730
and see, in deep time,
what underlies all these processes.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.568
[Clive] <i>We're sifting</i>
<i>through the trash of humans</i>

45:37.652 --> 45:40.404
<i>from 50 to 100,000 years ago.</i>

45:40.488 --> 45:45.117
<i>Do you think we have</i>
<i>another 100,000 years on planet Earth?</i>

45:45.201 --> 45:50.122
I would say that, you know,
another thousand years,

45:50.206 --> 45:53.709
we will be in a very critical situation,

45:53.793 --> 45:56.587
and so we will have to learn
from our mistakes

45:56.671 --> 46:03.219
and we'll have to work toward improving
the condition of our planet

46:03.302 --> 46:09.392
so that it can have the carrying capacity
to allow our species to perpetuate.

46:10.434 --> 46:12.270
[Clive] <i>If you had a time machine</i>
<i>that could go</i>

46:12.353 --> 46:15.106
<i>to only one time period in the past,</i>
<i>when would it be?</i>

46:15.189 --> 46:17.984
It would be exactly this time period

46:18.067 --> 46:20.736
because this is...

46:20.820 --> 46:26.826
I believe this is when we started
to look like us, um,

46:26.909 --> 46:30.204
and when we, uh,

46:30.288 --> 46:34.667
as a species, um, started.

46:34.750 --> 46:39.505
And so, this is before we became--

46:39.588 --> 46:42.216
we acquired different skin colors.

46:42.299 --> 46:46.554
This is before we acquired
different languages

46:46.637 --> 46:50.850
and we spread across
different geographies.

46:50.933 --> 46:54.228
So, this is where I want to be,
right at the root.

46:54.312 --> 46:58.899
So, I would love to express my...

46:58.983 --> 47:01.652
uh, my fascination to this ground

47:01.736 --> 47:04.196
by kissing it.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.157
And here I go.

47:16.083 --> 47:20.755
[Werner] <i>Professor Tim White of</i>
<i>the University of California, Berkeley,</i>

47:20.838 --> 47:22.465
<i>leads the team here.</i>

47:22.548 --> 47:28.262
<i>We were immediately captivated</i>
<i>by his wild style of explaining things.</i>

47:29.972 --> 47:31.640
So, look at the...

47:32.808 --> 47:34.060
powder.

47:34.143 --> 47:36.896
It blows in the wind,
it's very fine grain,

47:36.979 --> 47:39.565
it's all floodplain, it's all silt.

47:39.648 --> 47:43.819
But it all started as volcanic rock
from the highlands,

47:43.903 --> 47:45.279
from the rift margin,

47:45.362 --> 47:49.283
ground up over millions of years,
distributed out here,

47:49.366 --> 47:51.619
and redistributed by the Awash River.

47:51.702 --> 47:53.996
If you die today,

47:54.080 --> 47:56.457
your body will decompose
on the floodplain.

47:56.540 --> 47:59.668
If the hyenas don't chew
all the bones up,

47:59.752 --> 48:03.672
the next time the river floods,
this soft, silty material

48:03.756 --> 48:05.341
will be carried in,

48:05.424 --> 48:08.385
and it will encase your bones.

48:09.136 --> 48:10.429
Let's go.

48:10.513 --> 48:11.597
[engine starts]

48:24.276 --> 48:26.695
[speaking in Afar]

48:36.372 --> 48:41.377
Oh, we're gonna call this
the Werner Herzog Highway.

48:42.294 --> 48:47.133
And what we're doing here
is opening up a space for the cars...

48:48.551 --> 48:53.264
so we can come through
with a full crew tomorrow morning...

48:54.223 --> 48:57.017
to recover the additional pieces
of the hominid

48:57.101 --> 49:01.522
that we found just up on top there,
on the eroding sediments.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.233
So, we'd like to pull the cars in
as close as we can get

49:04.316 --> 49:06.360
<i>so we can get all the equipment there.</i>

49:06.444 --> 49:10.281
<i>And we'll start an extraction process</i>
<i>to pull that hominid out.</i>

49:17.538 --> 49:20.583
How phenomenally lucky are we
to have arrived now

49:20.666 --> 49:25.379
and you've found
this 100,000-year-old human?

49:25.462 --> 49:27.423
This does not happen very often.

49:27.506 --> 49:31.010
These hominid fossils
are very, very rare.

49:31.093 --> 49:34.013
Finding an artifact, that's easier,

49:34.096 --> 49:37.808
because during any hominid's lifetime,
they can make dozens, thousands,

49:37.892 --> 49:41.812
of stone-age calling cards
scattered all over the landscape.

49:41.896 --> 49:44.440
But they only have one skeleton,
one dentition.

49:44.523 --> 49:47.234
They only die once.
So, think about it.

49:47.318 --> 49:50.237
Acres and acres of eroding sediment.

49:50.321 --> 49:52.865
How in the world can we find the place

49:52.948 --> 49:57.161
where this dead person's bones
came to rest

49:57.244 --> 49:59.872
and arrive just at the geological moment

49:59.955 --> 50:02.333
that erosion is carving
these sediments out,

50:02.416 --> 50:04.501
exposing these ancient surfaces,

50:04.585 --> 50:07.087
with the monkeys and the hippos
and everything else,

50:07.171 --> 50:09.757
thousands of bones and artifacts
all over the surface?

50:09.840 --> 50:12.176
And there's one guy,
one guy in the world.

50:12.259 --> 50:15.804
If I had to say, "Get that guy out here
on the surface.

50:15.888 --> 50:18.224
He's gonna find the hominid."
You know who that is?

50:18.307 --> 50:20.851
That is Kampiro Kayrento,

50:20.935 --> 50:23.687
the world's greatest fossil finder.

50:23.771 --> 50:25.439
[indistinct chatter]

50:25.522 --> 50:26.774
Oh.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.734
This is Kampiro Kayrento.

50:28.817 --> 50:32.071
He is one of the world's experts,
if not <i>the </i> world's expert.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.448
He's the guy I want on the aircraft
to find things.

50:34.531 --> 50:38.827
He can recognize what's an antelope,
what's a carnivore,

50:38.911 --> 50:42.915
what's a fish, what's a baboon,
what's a zebra,

50:42.998 --> 50:46.752
what's a giraffe, what's a rhino.
He's got all that.

50:46.835 --> 50:49.547
Not from the whole animal,
because you never find the whole animal.

50:49.630 --> 50:53.133
You find pieces of animals,
pieces of the bones of animals.

50:53.217 --> 50:54.802
<i>He knows what they are.</i>

51:00.516 --> 51:01.559
You got anything, Tim?

51:01.642 --> 51:03.519
More pieces for the puzzle.

51:04.353 --> 51:08.399
Cranial vault piece,
freshly out of the ground.

51:08.482 --> 51:11.735
That one needs to be squirted off.

51:11.819 --> 51:14.238
This bone is beautifully preserved,

51:14.321 --> 51:17.658
completely silicified,
completely fossilized.

51:18.409 --> 51:22.204
So, we've got now
a number of different elements.

51:22.288 --> 51:29.086
The most diagnostic and important one,
ultimately, will be this one here,

51:29.169 --> 51:32.965
which is... the top...

51:34.008 --> 51:37.219
of the left orbit.

51:37.303 --> 51:40.055
So to sort of place it in Clive's head...

51:43.767 --> 51:46.395
-Whereabouts?
-Other side. There you go.

51:46.478 --> 51:47.604
Okay.

51:47.688 --> 51:52.192
I'm looking into the eye
of a Paleolithic hominid that lived here.

51:53.652 --> 51:56.322
So, it's a three-dimensional
jigsaw puzzle.

52:01.785 --> 52:05.039
[Clive] Yeah, no one's gonna argue
that those two pieces fit back together.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.457
That's a nice fit.

52:06.540 --> 52:09.585
In evolutionary terms,
here in the Middle Awash,

52:09.668 --> 52:12.296
we have six million years' worth
of rocks.

52:12.379 --> 52:17.176
The ones on the bottom
have small-brained early bipeds.

52:17.259 --> 52:20.012
These are close to the top
of the succession.

52:20.095 --> 52:22.389
These are much more like you and I.

52:22.473 --> 52:25.100
They have chins, vertical foreheads.

52:25.184 --> 52:29.563
We still have a lot to learn about them,
but the importance for humanity

52:29.647 --> 52:33.859
is that this is the right time,
100,000 years ago,

52:33.942 --> 52:36.820
and the right place, Africa,

52:36.904 --> 52:39.657
according to the archeology
and the genetic evidence...

52:40.783 --> 52:44.328
to know the people who were the ones

52:44.411 --> 52:48.582
who expanded from Africa to Asia,

52:48.666 --> 52:51.085
to Europe, and then beyond.

52:53.045 --> 52:56.423
<i>While these people were living here</i>
<i>in tropical Africa,</i>

52:56.507 --> 52:59.760
<i>dining on hippos,</i>
<i>Europe was locked under ice.</i>

53:05.474 --> 53:08.644
Let's go get more pieces.
Are we ready to rock 'n' roll?

53:08.727 --> 53:09.937
Let's get brushes.

53:11.563 --> 53:15.275
<i>We've taken all of</i>
<i>the surface-exposed bone off the surface.</i>

53:15.359 --> 53:18.779
<i>We suspect there's going to be</i>
<i>sub-surface bone in here.</i>

53:18.862 --> 53:22.241
We've maximized where we think it is,

53:22.324 --> 53:27.079
and now it's a matter
of going to the casino

53:27.162 --> 53:28.914
and rolling the dice

53:28.997 --> 53:33.001
and hoping we're gonna get
some nice human anatomy,

53:33.085 --> 53:36.171
fossilized for 100,000 years,
right out of this unit.

53:36.255 --> 53:38.715
We're just gonna brush and find bone.

53:38.799 --> 53:41.760
Whoa! There's a piece of bone
right there.

53:41.844 --> 53:44.680
That one's not identifiable,
but it might join other ones

53:44.763 --> 53:47.516
and become identifiable.
So, that's a keeper.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.726
Every single piece of bone
is a keeper.

53:57.109 --> 53:57.985
See the piece?

54:08.579 --> 54:10.372
So, that's a limb bone shaft.

54:10.456 --> 54:12.541
I can't tell which limb bone.
It's one of three.

54:12.624 --> 54:15.169
It's tibia, humerus or femur.

54:16.587 --> 54:20.299
Here we go.
That's a nice shaft piece.

54:20.382 --> 54:23.218
Again, it's tibia--
It's one of the major long bones.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.471
It's this one, this one or that one.

54:26.847 --> 54:30.309
You can see these things are--
they're completely turned to stone.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.436
They're completely fossilized,

54:32.519 --> 54:35.272
so they're brittle.

54:35.355 --> 54:38.942
And when erosion comes
and exposes them,

54:39.026 --> 54:40.652
they just shatter.

54:40.736 --> 54:43.864
And so, we have to be careful
to get all of the shattered pieces.

54:43.947 --> 54:48.243
My skeleton has 206 bones.
Same with this person.

54:48.327 --> 54:49.453
They're human.

54:49.995 --> 54:54.416
But now we're looking for literally
probably 4,000 pieces

54:54.500 --> 54:57.586
because all of those bones
each shattered.

54:57.669 --> 55:00.214
I can already see something
that discriminates you and I,

55:00.297 --> 55:02.257
which is, we've been here
the same amount of time.

55:02.341 --> 55:04.718
You've pulled out half a dozen
of these bone fragments.

55:04.801 --> 55:06.094
I haven't found anything.

55:06.178 --> 55:10.265
There's clearly an expertise
that goes with this business.

55:10.349 --> 55:12.226
But the greatest thing about the game

55:12.309 --> 55:15.562
is the combination of the expertise
and the luck.

55:15.646 --> 55:17.022
Like Las Vegas.

55:17.898 --> 55:21.485
Viva Las Vegas!

55:21.568 --> 55:23.445
Courtesy of Bizayu.

55:23.529 --> 55:28.075
Bizayu! Got a limb bone shaft.
Thank you.

55:29.618 --> 55:31.203
What's wrong over there, Clive?

55:31.286 --> 55:32.412
[chuckling]

55:33.497 --> 55:35.499
-Ohh!
-Ohh!

55:35.582 --> 55:38.418
[laughing]

55:38.502 --> 55:40.170
Whoo!

55:40.254 --> 55:41.421
[indistinct chatter]

55:41.505 --> 55:43.715
Check it out!

55:44.675 --> 55:45.843
Clive.

55:48.428 --> 55:50.222
Where does it fit in?

55:50.305 --> 55:54.268
Check it out. This is a distal humerus.

55:54.351 --> 55:55.936
Definitely hominid.

55:56.520 --> 56:02.317
It is right down at the end
of your upper arm bone.

56:02.401 --> 56:04.945
So, if we were to place this
in our anatomy,

56:05.028 --> 56:07.489
we'd set it up something like that.

56:07.573 --> 56:10.450
I figured out, Tim,
I'm holding the brush wrong.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.995
There's got to be something wrong
with my technique.

56:13.078 --> 56:15.497
Come on, Clive,
move over into the hot place there.

56:15.581 --> 56:17.457
I'm moving K.K. out.
This is your chance.

56:17.541 --> 56:20.002
-You don't think it's too hot for me?
-This is your chance.

56:20.085 --> 56:22.504
You got to get in here, man.
This guy's finding everything.

56:22.588 --> 56:24.006
I was right there.

56:24.089 --> 56:25.465
[laughter]

56:25.549 --> 56:26.967
He planted it.

56:27.050 --> 56:28.302
[laughter continues]

56:28.385 --> 56:30.262
It's just to make me look bad, isn't it?

56:31.179 --> 56:33.265
-I'll stick to volcanology.
-Brush, man, brush!

56:33.348 --> 56:34.933
He's going to lose this race.

56:36.226 --> 56:39.354
Piece after piece
after piece after piece.

56:39.438 --> 56:41.565
Maybe we'll get it all
back together again.

56:42.190 --> 56:45.485
If we're lucky.
If Clive would just find something!

56:46.194 --> 56:47.905
-I'm not gonna give up.
-Come on, Clive.

57:00.167 --> 57:02.002
Huh? Look at...

57:04.880 --> 57:06.757
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:06.840 --> 57:09.926
Whoa! Bingo!

57:10.552 --> 57:13.138
-[Clive] Is it a human?
-Yeah.

57:13.221 --> 57:15.933
All right! He's got it.

57:16.767 --> 57:18.727
Clive scores!

57:19.811 --> 57:22.064
[sighs]
It's such a relief.

57:25.108 --> 57:27.194
Just out of the dirt,

57:27.277 --> 57:29.529
where it's been 100,000 years, maybe.

57:31.156 --> 57:35.577
A little piece of my direct ancestor,
perhaps.

57:38.121 --> 57:41.959
It's quite heavy. It's, uh, fossilized.

57:47.923 --> 57:50.842
One skeleton from Kenya.

57:52.219 --> 57:54.805
One skeleton from two meters up,

57:54.888 --> 57:58.100
500 meters away,
in the Middle Awash.

57:58.892 --> 58:00.227
And this one.

58:00.310 --> 58:06.650
That's how rare even partial skeletons
of human ancestors are

58:06.733 --> 58:08.318
in that time interval.

58:08.402 --> 58:10.654
Just the first surface sweep,

58:10.737 --> 58:15.033
we've probably got another 30 pieces
of this individual,

58:15.117 --> 58:19.287
and all of this came out
in about 30 minutes

58:19.371 --> 58:21.456
of simply sweeping.

58:21.540 --> 58:25.293
As these piles that we've swept up
go through the sieve,

58:25.377 --> 58:27.963
<i>we're gonna have</i>
<i>a bunch of other pieces of bone</i>

58:28.046 --> 58:31.758
<i>that escaped the brushing</i>
<i>but won't escape our sieve.</i>

58:31.842 --> 58:35.303
Hopefully,
we'll see a cranium take shape,

58:35.387 --> 58:38.181
and we'll come to know
the anatomy of this person.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.976
I just-- What a phenomenal cornucopia

58:41.059 --> 58:43.645
for half an hour's work
with a dustpan and brush.

58:43.729 --> 58:46.606
It's just-- just sensational.

58:46.690 --> 58:49.609
One of three in Africa
ever recovered.

58:50.819 --> 58:52.612
Your timing was very good.

58:53.822 --> 58:56.533
[singing]

58:56.616 --> 58:57.993
What? Wait a minute.

58:58.076 --> 59:00.370
There's a Konso dance going on here
in the background.

59:00.454 --> 59:02.956
-It's gonna be good.
-This is gonna be good.

59:03.040 --> 59:06.626
<i>-Moya!</i>
<i>-Moya </i> means, in Afarinia, "head."

59:06.710 --> 59:08.420

Got the <i>moya.</i>

59:12.299 --> 59:13.800
Whoo!

59:13.884 --> 59:15.510

59:30.192 --> 59:33.153
Time for a Shakespearean moment, perhaps,

59:33.236 --> 59:39.284
to soliloquize on... my deep ancestry.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.122
I can see the curvature.

59:44.998 --> 59:47.042
It's the biggest piece we have so far.

<i>This area is the site</i>

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.880
[Clive] <i>The molten rock</i>
<i>came up to the surface</i>

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:29.509
<i>and rent open</i>
<i>a 27-kilometer-long fissure</i>

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:35.390
that stretches in this direction
for something like half of that distance.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:40.645
Overall, about 140 vents were active,

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:46.192
building up cones above them
with fire fountains rising into the air.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:52.157
And after a few months,
the fissure opened up in this direction,

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.243
again, another 13, 14 kilometers or so.

01:05:56.202 --> 01:05:59.122
And another few dozen vents open up,

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:03.042
and they spewed out lava
to the northeast of us.

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:06.546
Everything we see now
has been set in stone.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:11.050
The lava has solidified and frozen.
But if we'd been here at the time,

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:14.888
we would've seen jets of fire,
fountains of fire,

01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:18.558
rising a kilometer-and-a-half
into the air

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.644
and then cascading down
to the ground again.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:26.524
<i>And that built up the cones,</i>
<i>like the one that we're standing on now.</i>

01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:28.818
<i>And from the bases of these cones,</i>

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:31.529
<i>lava gushed out</i>
<i>at a phenomenal rate.</i>

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:34.240
<i>This is very, very hot lava,</i>
<i>very, very fluid,</i>

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.409
<i>and it poured down the valleys,</i>

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:40.455
<i>filling them to depths</i>
<i>of 100, 150 meters.</i>

01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.803
[Werner]
<i>These primordial occurrences</i>

<i>influenced the sense of mythical poetry</i>
<i>of the Icelanders.</i>

<i>It exists only in a single manuscript.</i>

<i>For Iceland, it is as important</i>
<i>as the Dead Sea Scrolls are for Israel.</i>

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:19.452

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:27.919
<i>Hence its name:</i>
<i>The Royal Codex, or Codex Regius.</i>

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:32.966
<i>In 1971,</i>
<i>Denmark returned it to Iceland.</i>

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.719
<i>Knowing that it constituted</i>
<i>the soul of the country,</i>

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:40.473
<i>the codex was put</i>
<i>on Denmark's largest battleship</i>

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.184
<i>and escorted by a whole fleet.</i>

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.396
<i>No amount of money in the world</i>
<i>would be enough</i>

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.440
<i>to purchase this manuscript</i>
<i>from Iceland,</i>

01:07:49.524 --> 01:07:53.695
<i>although it is battered and crumpled</i>
<i>and filled with holes.</i>

01:07:56.656 --> 01:08:00.451
<i>In the opening passage, called</i>
<i>"The Prophecy of the Seeress,"</i>

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:05.623
<i>there is an apocalyptic vision</i>
<i>of the end of the pagan gods.</i>

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:09.252
<i>This seems to describe</i>
<i>a huge volcanic event.</i>

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:15.925
<i>"'Neath the sea the land sinketh,</i>

<i>better known in the West</i>

<i>It has been inactive</i>
<i>for more than 1,000 years,</i>

01:10:15.795 --> 01:10:19.757
<i>but it plays a huge role</i>
<i>in the imagination of the people.</i>

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:24.804
<i>For millennia, it was considered</i>
<i>the mythical birthplace</i>

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.889
<i>of the Korean nation.</i>

01:10:26.973 --> 01:10:31.269
<i>Today, the socialist government</i>
<i>co-opts this myth.</i>

01:10:32.854 --> 01:10:35.481
<i>This is the site of pilgrimages.</i>

01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:42.572
<i>Out of the mist, we saw a formation</i>
<i>of uniformed men with a flag emerging.</i>

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.574
<i>We believed they were soldiers,</i>

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:47.827
<i>but it turned out</i>
<i>they were university students</i>

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:30.054
<i>A unique opportunity</i>
<i>presented itself to us.</i>

01:12:30.137 --> 01:12:33.140
<i>The near-impervious country</i>
<i>opened its doors</i>

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:35.518
<i>to a joint scientific program</i>

<i>between the University of Cambridge</i>

[singing continues]

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:55.037
<i>But everything we saw</i>
<i>was an act of presentation,</i>

01:12:55.121 --> 01:12:56.873
<i>and we went for it.</i>

01:12:56.956 --> 01:13:00.376
<i>There is no other way</i>
<i>to see this enigmatic country</i>

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:03.754
<i>other than how it wants</i>
<i>to present itself.</i>

[female presenter speaking Korean]

[presenter's voice continues,
slowly fades]

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:12.114
One thing that's remarkable
and I'm very aware of as I work here

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:14.200
is the sanctity of this mountain.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:18.496
This has a very long history,
going back 5,000 years,

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:23.584
as the mythical birthplace
of the Korean people from this volcano.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:27.171
And through the medieval period
and to the more modern period,

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:29.882
this is the sacred mountain
of the revolution,

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.885
where the struggle was fought
against Japanese occupation

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.553
70 years ago.

01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:39.308
And the spirit of the mountain
is in all the Korean people,

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.561
and this is something very, very special
about this place.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.109
It seems like we're on a tranquil
boat trip on a Norwegian fjord,

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:50.194
but actually we're at ground zero

01:14:50.277 --> 01:14:53.572
of what was a most monumental
volcanic eruption

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:57.118
nearly 1,100 years ago,
the so-called Millennium eruption.

01:14:57.868 --> 01:15:00.454
The crater here
is about three miles across.

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:03.874
And actually these cliffs are all part
of the crater rim,

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:06.335
all around us, 360 degrees.

01:15:07.044 --> 01:15:09.505
The amount of pumice
that came out in the eruption

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:11.757
would be enough to bury
the whole of New York City.

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:14.927
Only the highest buildings
would poke out of the top.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:17.930
In a way, if you look at the crater
surrounding us

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.559
and imagine that once there was a cone
built over our heads,

01:15:21.642 --> 01:15:26.981
that missing volume alone
accounts for a huge amount of rock

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:29.233
and pumice and lava.

01:15:29.316 --> 01:15:32.820
So, this has been spewed out
over the Korean peninsula,

01:15:32.903 --> 01:15:36.115
it's in parts of China,
it's in parts of Russia,

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:39.744
and there's even
about three inches of ash

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:43.205
that fell over parts of Japan
that you can still find today.

01:15:44.665 --> 01:15:48.794
<i>Around ten years ago,</i>
<i>there was a swarm of earthquakes</i>

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.297
<i>that were detected</i>
<i>by sensitive instruments</i>

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.673
<i>around the mountain,</i>

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:56.719
<i>and that really ignited</i>
<i>the scientific interest in the volcano</i>

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:59.972
<i>and whether there might be</i>
<i>signs of reawakening.</i>

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:03.392
<i>Over the last few years,</i>

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:06.103
<i>we've built a really strong</i>
<i>and unique collaboration</i>

01:16:06.187 --> 01:16:08.022
<i>with scientists from Pyongyang</i>

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.357
<i>who've worked here for 10, 20 years,</i>

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:14.361
<i>so they have very detailed knowledge</i>
<i>of the structure of the volcano.</i>

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.322
<i>So, we've learnt a lot from them.</i>

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:20.576
<i>It's very difficult for scientists here</i>
<i>to attend international conferences,</i>

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:24.080
<i>so we've really shared our experiences</i>
<i>and expertise</i>

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:26.582
<i>to better understand this volcano.</i>

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.292
So, two years of data.

01:16:28.375 --> 01:16:31.378
Yeah, we've collected
two years of seismic data.

01:16:31.462 --> 01:16:35.132
Uh, which is pretty incredible. Um...

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:40.221
And the seismometer sitting here
will record all the earthquakes.

01:16:40.304 --> 01:16:44.266
[Clive] It looks just like a paint pot
linked to a laptop,

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:47.853
and yet that's recorded
this unique data service,

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:49.480
so that's really something.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:51.357
Looks can be deceptive.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:56.862
It's an incredibly sensitive instrument
in there.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:17:01.158
So, it records, you know,
um, just minor movements.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:04.787
Even us walking around here
will be creating noise.

01:17:04.870 --> 01:17:06.997
So, this is Mr. Yun Yong-Gun.

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:10.668
He's the vice-director
of the Earthquake Administration

01:17:10.751 --> 01:17:15.256
and kind of leads the DPRK side
of the project.

01:17:16.173 --> 01:17:18.134
[speaking Korean]

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:28.185
The Earthquake Administration of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

01:17:28.269 --> 01:17:33.107
pays special attention to this project
of international joint research.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.650
[speaking Korean]

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:49.039
Great importance is given to this mountain

01:17:49.123 --> 01:17:53.085
just because around this mountain,
our great leader President Kim Il-sung

01:17:53.169 --> 01:17:55.963
fought against the Japanese imperialists.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:18:00.092

<i>appropriated the myth of the volcano.</i>

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:09.727
<i>He established his secret</i>
<i>military headquarters</i>

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:13.105
<i>in a forest right here</i>
<i>at the foot of the mountain,</i>

01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:18.235
<i>thus transferring its power and dynamic</i>
<i>into his revolution.</i>

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.702
<i>This monument is a gateway</i>
<i>to the sacred ground.</i>

the first time on the homeland,
and they could not sleep.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:04.114
You can see there are lady guerrillas

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:07.826
who are now sewing the buttons
to the clothes.

our great leader
Generalissimo Kim Jong-il

And a little further up,
we have the lake number three.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:18.147
When our great leader Generalissimo
Kim Jong-il came here in March, 2003,

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:21.233
he highly appreciated
the beauty of these trees.

[Han Myong Il] Actually,
the life in the secret camp in those days

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:08.132
was so difficult
that they had no blankets at all.

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:12.886
That is why the guerrilla soldiers,
collected their pad wads

01:22:57.222 --> 01:23:03.103
<i>A prearranged pattern of color cards</i>
<i>is held and flipped over in sync.</i>

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:11.028
<i>Here, the rising sun over the landscape</i>

[orchestral music playing]

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:34.510
<i>And here, father and son</i>
<i>of the revolution.</i>

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:39.264
<i>All this appears like a cosmic metaphor</i>

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:42.601
<i>for a society aligned</i>
<i>in a unified pattern</i>

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.103
<i>behind a common ideology.</i>

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:09.002
<i>But in all this display of the masses,</i>

01:24:09.086 --> 01:24:12.839
<i>I find an underlying emptiness</i>
<i>and solitude.</i>

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:31.358
<i>Because of the North Korean ideology</i>
<i>of political and economic self-reliance,</i>

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:35.153
<i>and because</i>
<i>of internationally-imposed sanctions,</i>

01:24:35.237 --> 01:24:37.114
<i>the country is unique.</i>

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:41.243
<i>The population at large</i>
<i>has very limited contact</i>

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.412
<i>with the outside world.</i>

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:48.375
<i>There are no international phone lines</i>
<i>or Internet available to the public,</i>

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:52.504
<i>no radio or television</i>
<i>from the outside world.</i>

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:56.425
<i>To our eyes,</i>
<i>it is strange to see people</i>

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:59.052
<i>not glued to their cell phones.</i>

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.806
<i>There is no advertising anywhere.</i>

01:25:02.889 --> 01:25:06.560
<i>Instead,</i>
<i>just the ever-present propaganda.</i>

01:25:07.644 --> 01:25:09.730
<i>There are no newsstands,</i>

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:13.025
<i>only the official party newspaper</i>
<i>on display.</i>

01:26:03.825 --> 01:26:07.412
<i>In the subway, in the streets,</i>
<i>almost everywhere,</i>

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:12.876
<i>you'll find pictures of the leaders,</i>
<i>always in the vicinity of the volcano.</i>

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:24.763
<i>Back on the mountain, we spoke</i>
<i>to a historian who was assigned to us.</i>

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:29.685
<i>We asked him about the photos</i>
<i>and the precise location</i>

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:31.937
<i>of where they had been taken.</i>

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:36.066
He probably stood exactly at the place
you are standing now.

01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:38.402

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.956
Not this place, but up there
on the Janggun Peak.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.875
[Werner] <i>Yeah. They're famous photos.</i>
<i>We know them.</i>

01:26:55.961 --> 01:27:00.298
About this monument,
it dates back to what time, roughly?

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.008
[speaking Korean]

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.729
[Han Myong Il]
<i>It dates back to the early 20th century.</i>

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:19.443
<i>It was erected by the heavenly people</i>
<i>living around this area.</i>

01:27:19.526 --> 01:27:22.195
<i>And, according to the inscription</i>
<i>on the monument,</i>

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:25.574
they prayed to Mount Paektu
and Lake Chon here

01:27:25.657 --> 01:27:28.618
to give birth to a prominent person

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:33.331
who can give prosperity and happiness
to the Korean nation.

01:27:33.415 --> 01:27:36.001
[Werner]
And the person materialized?

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:37.836
[speaking Korean]

01:27:40.839 --> 01:27:42.174
You are quite right.

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:47.137
This kind of miserable nation
was rescued and saved

01:27:47.220 --> 01:27:52.309
just by our great leader,
the fearless patriot Kim Il-sung,

01:27:52.392 --> 01:27:54.853
who fought against
the Japanese imperialists.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:57.814
[Werner] And how do you feel,
as a historian,

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:01.234
with all the thousands of years
behind you,

01:28:01.318 --> 01:28:05.655
how do you feel personally?
Is there pride? Is there patriotism?

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:07.741
Eh...

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:11.119

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:25.509
<i>of the omnipotent ideology</i>
<i>of the people and their leadership.</i>

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:32.390
All the Korean people
frequently climb up to this mountain,

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:36.228
but every time whenever
they climb up this mountain,

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:39.105
they have a new feeling,
a solemn feeling,

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:42.901
and at the same time,
they make up a new determination

01:28:42.984 --> 01:28:46.404
to work harder for the country
with patriotism.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:50.492
And all the Korean people
are now singing the song

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:54.704
whose title is
"Let Us Go to Mount Paektu."

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:59.584

01:43:25.032 --> 01:43:26.242
<i>Like water.</i>

01:43:31.497 --> 01:43:37.044
And so, I believe that this volcano
will destroy this world someday.

01:43:40.715 --> 01:43:43.008
[choral music playing]

01:43:43.092 --> 01:43:45.219
[rumbling]

01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:19.128
[choral music continues]
