00:03.537 --> 00:05.504
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:05.573 --> 00:07.973
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.042 --> 00:09.975
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.043 --> 00:12.310
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.379 --> 00:14.846
¶ The mate was
     a mighty sailin' man ¶

00:14.915 --> 00:17.215
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.284 --> 00:19.451
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:19.519 --> 00:21.720
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:21.789 --> 00:24.556
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:24.625 --> 00:26.658
[thunder rumbling]

00:26.727 --> 00:28.860
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:28.929 --> 00:31.230
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.298 --> 00:33.832
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:33.901 --> 00:35.967
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.036 --> 00:38.303
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.372 --> 00:40.171

     on the shore ¶

01:43.570 --> 01:47.673
What a mob, boss,
half a million bucks.

01:47.741 --> 01:50.509
I'm well aware of
            the contents, Gates.

01:53.714 --> 01:56.781
Boy, you, you sure know
how to pick a hideout, boss.

01:56.850 --> 01:58.884
Boy, this little old island
ain't even on the maps.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.918
Precisely.

01:59.987 --> 02:02.253
Uncharted, uninhabited.

02:02.322 --> 02:03.655
A perfect place to relax

02:03.724 --> 02:05.957
while the police conduct
        their investigation.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.859
I'll be back for you
real soon, boss.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.360
You boys take Sea Spray back
into the regular shipping lanes

02:10.430 --> 02:13.131
as soon as possible
so the coastguard will spot you.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.534
Now, once the Sea Spray
 has been boarded and searched

02:15.602 --> 02:19.103
you come back here, pick me up,
and we go to South America.

02:19.172 --> 02:21.339
I got to hand it
to you, boss.

02:21.408 --> 02:23.107
Now, look.
You got everything?

02:23.176 --> 02:24.709
Uh, let's see.

02:24.778 --> 02:27.245
Food stuffs,
      cooking utensils, bed roll

02:27.314 --> 02:30.348
a large deposit
           from the Monarch Bank

02:30.417 --> 02:32.450
and a good friend.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.686
You got everything.
I'll see you, boss.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.927
Ladies, what's
         for breakfast?

02:43.230 --> 02:45.363
Take a wild guess
       and try coconut.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.064
[all sighing]

02:47.133 --> 02:50.635
- Well, never mind. Just dig in.
- Skipper, it's always coconut.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.704
Sliced coconut, diced coconut
 baked coconut

02:52.773 --> 02:54.572
fried coconut,
 coconut on coconut, coconut--

02:54.641 --> 02:56.507
We're gonna have a special treat
for Thanksgiving dinner.

02:56.576 --> 02:59.444
- What's that?
      - Coconut drumstick.

03:03.049 --> 03:04.916
[sniffing]

03:04.985 --> 03:06.518
I smell bacon.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.421
Sure you do, Gilligan.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.925
I think Gilligan's been
         on the island too long.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.864
You know I thought
I smelled bacon too.

03:19.933 --> 03:21.366
See.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.102
Unfortunately, it's just
a figment of our imagination.

03:24.170 --> 03:27.305
Yeah? Well, my figment
 smells just the way I like it.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.274
Well done and crisp.

03:31.345 --> 03:33.679
- 'Gilligan.'
     - Over here, Skipper.

03:35.148 --> 03:38.317
Listen, buddy, if we wanna eat
  something beside coconuts

03:38.385 --> 03:40.385
we're gonna have to get
        some other kind of food.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.354
I'm all set.
I'm gonna pick some dates.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.721
With a bow and arrow?

03:43.790 --> 03:45.824
Since we can't climb
these trees, so I figured

03:45.892 --> 03:47.526
I'll shoot 'em down.

03:47.594 --> 03:49.794
Well, certainly, Gilligan,
      and if you're real careful

03:49.863 --> 03:52.430
maybe you can shoot the pits
    out of 'em at same time.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.232
I bet it works. Watch.

03:54.301 --> 03:56.601
Gilligan, you pose some pretty
  funny stunts on this island--

03:56.670 --> 03:59.404
[T'chi]

03:59.472 --> 04:02.173
Ow! Ow! It worked.
It worked, Skipper.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.743
Look, Skipper. Look at 'em.
Oh Dates! Dates! Dates! Dates!

04:05.812 --> 04:09.114
Little buddy, you did it.
  I'll gather and take 'em back.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.548
You go out
             and hunt some more.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.085
Skipper, I shot 'em
so I ought to take 'em to camp.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.953
I was sayin' I shot 'em down
so you ought to take 'em.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.990
- Exactly.
        - See you later.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.934
[comical music]

04:48.255 --> 04:50.722
[T'chi]
        [comical music]

04:54.662 --> 04:56.661
I did it. I got a hit.
          A direct hit.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.696
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
               Look at 'em all.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.565
Look at 'em all, mister.
        Look at 'em all.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.668
A bit hit.
                     Look, look.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.638
- What are you doin' here?
   - Me?

05:07.707 --> 05:09.974
I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.609
I was shipwrecked.

05:11.678 --> 05:13.744
Amazing. That's just
what happened to me.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.481
Shipwrecked.
Barely made it to shore.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.182
I'm sure glad
                   you made it.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.152
You were shipwrecked, how come
  your clothes are not wrinkled?

05:21.221 --> 05:23.588
Drip dry.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.458
- Your shoes?
        - Drip dry too.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.292
I guess you're
          drip drying everything

05:28.361 --> 05:29.160
since we got shipwrecked.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.796
- We?
            - Yeah.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.030
There are other people
on this island beside yourself?

05:33.099 --> 05:34.900
The Skipper, the Professor,
     Ginger, Mary Ann

05:34.968 --> 05:36.701
Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.136
I see.

05:38.205 --> 05:40.738
I don't know how your boat got
  wrecked, no boats come here.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.741
I was destined for an
island in this vicinity.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.110
All the islands around
          here are uninhabited.

05:45.179 --> 05:47.212
Except for a few
       with wild natives on 'em.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.613
Well, that's just it.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.049
I was heading for an island
with wild natives.

05:51.118 --> 05:53.484
I was to help them rid their
island of tropical diseases.

05:53.553 --> 05:56.621
You see...I am a doctor.

05:56.689 --> 05:59.791
Doctor? Boy, what a break having
a doctor here in the island.

05:59.859 --> 06:03.495
- Did you save many lives?
   - Saved a few. Lost a few.

06:03.563 --> 06:05.530
You can't win 'em all.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.001
My name's Gilligan.

06:10.070 --> 06:13.237
I'm Jackson Farrell.
Dr. Jackson Farrell.

06:13.306 --> 06:16.174
Glad to meet you, sir,
 I'll introduce you to the rest.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.475
You'll like 'em,
                I know you will.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.143
I'm sure
I will.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.580
I see you have a bow and arrow.
There are no guns on the island?

06:22.649 --> 06:24.315
- Oh, we have guns.
      - Oh.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.784
No bullets.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.587
- I used to shoot down dates.
 - Quite right.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.623
- That's how we met.
      - Yeah. Real fun.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.159
Just kinda get it like that
  and then you just kinda..

06:39.999 --> 06:43.201
- Money! Money! Money! Money!
 - Gilligan. Gilligan.

06:43.269 --> 06:45.537
- We're rich, rich.
   - Gilligan, just a minute.

06:45.605 --> 06:48.539
Now don't worry. I'll cut you in
because you were here.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.441
How did it get up there?

06:50.510 --> 06:52.310
Now, let me explain, Gilligan.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.912
You remember me telling you

06:53.981 --> 06:56.814
about the natives
and the tropical diseases.

06:56.883 --> 06:59.617
Well, this money is part
of the endowment

06:59.686 --> 07:01.419
to build a hospital
on that island.

07:01.488 --> 07:02.887
Oh.

07:02.956 --> 07:06.357
Fortunately, I saved the sack
before the boat went down.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.960
You mean, people donated
        this money to you?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.829
That's a good way to put it.
They donated it.

07:11.898 --> 07:14.132
Oh. Well, that sure
            was generous of 'em.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.836
Gilligan, you should have seen
the way they handed it to me.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.041
(Gilligan)
     'Mr. and Mrs. Howell.'

07:23.109 --> 07:25.410
Here comes Gilligan with a man
we've never seen before.

07:25.479 --> 07:28.246
I wish he wouldn't drop by with
 people, we're not even dressed.

07:28.315 --> 07:31.349
Mr. and Mrs. Howell, I'd like
 to have you meet Dr. Farrell.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.717
Doctor, how marvelous!

07:32.785 --> 07:35.487
Doctor, you know, I have
        the worst shooting pain.

07:36.923 --> 07:38.823
- Have you had it before?
   - Yes. Yes.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.859
- Well, you've got it again.
  - Shh.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.761
He was shipwrecked on his way
to an island to help natives.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.131
You work with natives?
    That must be very rewarding.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.666
I'm gonna go
tell the others.

07:47.734 --> 07:51.903
Sit down, doctor, you can join
lovely Mrs. Howell and myself.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.838
So you were wrecked
en route to the island?

07:53.906 --> 07:56.006
Yes. It came as
                 quite a blow.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.908
I had great plans
       for the island.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.246
Modern hospital, latest
   technical equipment, lab.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.881
Oh, your laboratory.

08:02.950 --> 08:05.683
Well, hospitals happen to be
  one of our favorite charities.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.886
Lovey, remind me
            to send him a check.

08:07.954 --> 08:10.721
Will a few hundred thousand
     dollars be enough?

08:10.790 --> 08:12.523
A few hundred thousand?

08:12.592 --> 08:13.892
Well, of course, doctor.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.961
Philanthropic work like yours
must be encouraged.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.231
Native diseases so often
affect the natives.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.898
Doctor, with that kind
          of money could you

08:20.967 --> 08:23.234
possibly name
             a disease after us?

08:23.302 --> 08:26.871
Not the run-of-the-mill disease.
Something a little special.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.641
Uh, for example,
something like beriberi.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.176
Yes, yes. Perhaps, you could
    call it Howell-Howell.

08:32.245 --> 08:33.778
Oh, marvelous, Thurston.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.581
In that way, we'd each get
separate billing.

08:39.486 --> 08:41.086
He was washed up
in the island.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.354
Oh, I'm so glad
         you were saved, doctor.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.758
What a lucky break, if any of us
get sick you can give us a shot.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.761
True. I might be able to
    give you a shot.

08:49.829 --> 08:51.696
He's a famous doctor.
Builds hospitals and everything.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.564
- Oh.
        - How exciting.

08:53.633 --> 08:55.833
What do you
          specialize in, doctor?

08:55.902 --> 08:58.369
- Surgery.
           - Surgery!

08:58.438 --> 09:02.641
Yes, I have devoted most
 of my life to removing things.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.946
I insist that you move in
      with us and share our hut.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.914
Certainly, doc.
Everything we have is yours.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.249
You're all very kind,
     but I'm sure

09:11.318 --> 09:12.917
you're somewhat pressed
    for accommodations.

09:12.986 --> 09:14.685
Nonsense. We've got
plenty of room.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.687
- Sure, right.
- You can have Gilligan's bunk.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.623
Now, I don't wish
       to impose.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.424
It's no imposition at all,
   is it, Gilligan?

09:20.493 --> 09:21.992
No. It's no imposition at all.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.995
Gilligan will move
        his gear out, won't you?

09:24.063 --> 09:26.831
Sure, he'll move his
      gear out right away.

09:34.340 --> 09:37.008
[mumbling]

09:41.381 --> 09:43.381
(man on radio)
  'We interrupt this program
  for special news bulletin.'

09:43.449 --> 09:46.184
'The international master
   criminal, Jackson Farrell'

09:46.252 --> 09:48.285
'has escaped by sea with
  over a half million dollars'

09:48.354 --> 09:50.555
'taken in a holdup from the
  Monarch Bank last Thursday.'

09:50.624 --> 09:51.923
Jackson Farrell?

09:51.992 --> 09:54.225
'Yes, Jackson Farrell
     has done it again.'

09:54.294 --> 09:56.294
'No clues are available,
   but it is suspected that'

09:56.363 --> 09:58.196
'Farrell and his accomplices
  are hiding out somewhere'

09:58.264 --> 10:00.732
'in the tiny, uncharted islands
of the South Pacific.'

10:00.801 --> 10:02.266
Doctor, when they discover
that you haven't arrived

10:02.335 --> 10:04.835
on this native island,
they'll send a search party?

10:04.904 --> 10:06.804
It's possible.
         Very possible.

10:06.873 --> 10:09.640
Well, is it possible
            when your ship..

10:09.709 --> 10:11.408
Excuse me, doctor.

10:11.477 --> 10:14.712
What is it, Gilligan? Something
 wrong with your finger?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.047
Nothing wrong with my finger.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.715
Would you like
     the doctor look at it?

10:17.784 --> 10:20.184
- No.
   - Then stop interrupting.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.354
I'm having a very important
   conversation with the doctor.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.957
What I wanted to ask you
     is when your ship went down

10:26.026 --> 10:27.992
possibly they took a fix
        on our position.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.762
Unfortunately,
  it all happened so quickly.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.032
I just wanted to say
   I caught a fish this big.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.668
Well, good for you, Gilligan.

10:36.737 --> 10:40.137
Now, will you get in the hut,
   clean it so he can move in.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.672
What's that you've
      got there, Gilligan?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.941
Transistor radio?

10:44.010 --> 10:45.543
- Yes, sir.
          - Oh.

10:45.612 --> 10:48.479
Then you're able to receive
news from the outside world.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.282
- Well, we could if it worked.
 - Nothing is wrong with it.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.951
See, I turn it on.
     Nothing even happens.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.187
- Give me that radio.
  - Skipper, it doesn't work.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.755
- Skipper, it doesn't work.
  - Give me the radio.

10:57.823 --> 11:01.459
Skipper, it doesn't work.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.661
Now, you did it. You broke it.
It'll never work now.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.629
You better hope
             it works, Gilligan.

11:05.698 --> 11:08.332
(man on radio)
 '...bulletin, it has been
 confirmed that the holdup at'

11:08.401 --> 11:11.502
'Monarch Bank was masterminded
by Jackson Farrell.'

11:11.571 --> 11:13.270
That's the news
for the day.

11:13.339 --> 11:15.273
Hold it!

11:15.342 --> 11:18.209
So now you know.

11:18.278 --> 11:21.112
Before too long a boat
      will arrive to pick me up.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.381
Until that time,
   I don't want any problems.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.617
If any problems do arise

11:26.686 --> 11:29.353
I won't hesitate
       to eliminate them.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.422
Any questions?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.491
Any bullets in that gun?

11:33.559 --> 11:34.859
[gunshot]

11:35.695 --> 11:37.762
Any more questions?

11:44.070 --> 11:47.171
- Any sign of him?
 - No. He must down some place.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.840
We got to have
               a plan of action.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.075
Seems reasonable he can't
       stay awake all night.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.110
Exactly. He got to
doze off some time.

11:53.179 --> 11:54.945
'That's when we can
get his gun.'

11:55.014 --> 11:57.114
When he dozes off,
       you two jump him

11:57.183 --> 12:00.218
his gun will fly in the air,
  I'll catch it and I'll say..

12:00.286 --> 12:02.253
- Good evening.
        - Good evening.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.322
Sounds like
a very intriguing plan.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.757
Now, stay right there.

12:06.826 --> 12:08.393
Don't move.

12:08.461 --> 12:10.962
I just finished tying up
     the others for the evening.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.466
And now I want you
         to tie up both of them.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.434
Him first.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.138
Skipper, you better lay down.

12:24.143 --> 12:27.445
- Leave it a little loose.
   - Leave it a little what?

12:41.228 --> 12:42.526
There.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.329
That should keep you gentlemen
 in place for the night.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.832
I hope I haven't cut off
        your circulation.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.201
Oh, no, no. See.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.845
Thanks for telling me, Gilligan.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.014
You're welcome.

13:49.262 --> 13:52.296
Gilligan, you try.
   You're thinner than I am.

13:52.364 --> 13:56.701
Bend way down.
No, bend down, Gilligan.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.370
'Bend down.
          That's it.'

14:00.206 --> 14:02.874
Come on.
        Give him a push.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.477
'Push, Gilligan. Push.
     Professor, push it.'

14:06.546 --> 14:08.479
Skipper, I'm stuck.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.350
Skipper, he's coming back.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.423
Get down and push.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.068
[snoring]

14:33.406 --> 14:35.540
- Mr. Farrell?
         - Mr. Farrell?

14:35.609 --> 14:37.174
Where are you, Mr. Farrell?

14:37.243 --> 14:40.177
- Mr. Farrell?
         - Mr. Farrell?

14:40.246 --> 14:41.812
- Mr. Farrell?
          - Mr. Farrell?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.313
Ooh-oh!

14:43.382 --> 14:45.616
Mr. Farrell, Mrs. Howell
   and I have been discussing

14:45.685 --> 14:47.952
this rather sticky situation
  that does exist between us.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.422
You know, the fact that you're
 a thief instead of a doctor.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.890
Please, please, darling.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.892
Doctor Farrell.
      I mean, Mr. Farrell.

14:54.961 --> 14:58.429
I think this is something that
could be negotiated between us.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.799
I have this piece of driftwood
I have used as a check. You see.

15:01.868 --> 15:05.036
It says, "Pay to the order of
 Mr. Jackson Farrell

15:05.105 --> 15:08.272
One hundred thousand dollars"
 and my signature.

15:08.341 --> 15:11.375
A hundred thousand?
    That says ten thousand.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.913
Ten thousand, no, that comma,
 that's a piece of seaweed.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.715
Are you kidding?

15:17.783 --> 15:20.551
If I try to cash this check,
the police will be on me.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.952
He's right.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.722
It'll be disastrous for
 Mr. Farrell to cash that check.

15:24.790 --> 15:26.724
Please, Lovey.

15:26.793 --> 15:30.161
Sometimes I think a woman's
  place is in the hut.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.173
- The perfect setup.
      - Okay.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.575
I'll help you up.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.622
Gilligan, will you stop that.
 I'm on your side.

15:57.691 --> 16:00.224
I'll grab his gun
       after you hit him.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.730
Give me a hand, Skipper.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.440
[thud]

16:54.981 --> 16:57.415
Nice work, Gilligan.
We did it. We did it.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.651
We've got him.
We've got him.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.420
We have?

17:08.327 --> 17:11.061
I'm sorry. I slipped.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.535
- Here, let me help you.
    - Thank you, Professor.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.304
Gee, there must be
            something we can do.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.673
Well, that gun is the key
to the situation.

17:22.742 --> 17:25.009
If we could get that gun
before his friends arrive

17:25.077 --> 17:27.178
we'd have a chance.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.513
I think I've got an idea
        how to get that gun.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.248
Oh, how?

17:31.316 --> 17:32.816
Watch it.
                    He's coming.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.754
Okay, be jealous. I'm telling
   you he's my kind of man.

17:36.823 --> 17:40.224
If that's gonna be your attitude
I don't want any part of you.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.592
Go on. Get lost.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.795
Oh, Mr. Farrell.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.832
We were just discussing you.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.968
Won't you sit down?

17:51.037 --> 17:55.039
We were getting along so
  beautifully when we first met.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.675
That's when you thought
I was a doctor.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.312
Yeah. You are even
           more interesting now.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.413
It must be fascinating
          going to all those

18:03.482 --> 18:05.817
exotic places
             all over the world.

18:07.219 --> 18:09.754
When your friends
               come back

18:09.823 --> 18:11.589
how about taking
                me with you?

18:11.657 --> 18:13.758
Say, that's an idea.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.594
I've got enough loot now
to cover you in minks, sables.

18:17.663 --> 18:20.164
- You'd like that, huh?
    - I am a woman.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.266
Yeah, I noticed.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.207
We can make beautiful
music together, Jackson.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.375
Beautiful music.

18:32.444 --> 18:35.412
- Ginger.
        - Yes, Jackson.

18:35.481 --> 18:39.249
And that beautiful music
  will be "And the Angels Sing."

18:39.318 --> 18:41.652
If you get any closer
           to that gun.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.989
Hey, Skipper!
         Hey, Skipper!

18:46.058 --> 18:47.692
- What's the hurry, Gilligan?
- There's a boat rowing ashore.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.328
Well, I could see my departure
 is near at hand.

18:53.999 --> 18:57.001
Mr. Farrell, when you get back
 to civilization

18:57.070 --> 18:58.702
how about telling 'em we are
 stranded here on this island?

18:58.771 --> 19:00.370
And the run the risk
of you returning

19:00.439 --> 19:02.206
and blowing the whistle on me
and my friends?

19:02.275 --> 19:05.510
Gilligan, give me
that glass.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.451
That isn't any of my boys.
It's the Indigo mob.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.852
- The Indigo mob?
  - They must have tailed me.

19:15.921 --> 19:18.189
Skipper, Mr. and Mrs. Howell.

19:24.363 --> 19:29.634
Now, you're all going
to do exactly as I say.

19:48.354 --> 19:51.589
Remember, as natives,
     you speak no English.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.923
Understand?

19:52.992 --> 19:55.826
You'll answer all questions
  in native gibberish.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.128
But sir, what if we
     happen to happen to--

19:58.197 --> 19:59.964
[speaking gibberish]

20:10.877 --> 20:12.643
I'll be inside the hut
     with a gun

20:12.712 --> 20:14.544
pointed at your
     pretty little friend.

20:14.613 --> 20:18.549
Remember, one slip up
  and no pretty little friend.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.358
I hope on of 'em
can understand English.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.559
I've seen a lot
   of primitive tribes in my day

20:29.628 --> 20:31.595
but this one
                 takes the cake.

20:31.664 --> 20:34.732
This outfit can set back
civilization two thousand years.

20:34.800 --> 20:38.469
Looking for white man, criminal.
He hold up bank.

20:41.473 --> 20:43.840
'No speak English?'

20:43.909 --> 20:46.810
Lucky, looks to me like
      they don't speak anything.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.945
Yeah, come on.
Let's get out of here.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.915
[speaking gibberish]

20:52.351 --> 20:54.484
Oh, so you do talk.

20:54.553 --> 20:57.454
[speaking gibberish]

20:57.523 --> 20:58.922
Lucky, get a load
               of these two.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.991
It's hard to believe
          they are human beings.

21:01.060 --> 21:01.858
Yeah.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.928
[speaking gibberish]

21:06.799 --> 21:08.632
(Lucky)
      'That one don't need
      to speak anything.'

21:08.701 --> 21:11.735
You can say that again.
    Hello, darling.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.671
(Lucky)
    'I think she's trying
    to tell you something.'

21:13.740 --> 21:16.840
I'm trying to tell her
     something too.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.342
(Lucky)
  'It's a good thing she can't
  understand English.'

21:18.410 --> 21:20.878
'She'd slap you face.'

21:22.648 --> 21:24.749
Must have been
                  what I said.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.916
[speaking gibberish]

21:25.984 --> 21:27.584
Let's get out of here.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.587
[speaking gibberish]

21:31.290 --> 21:33.223
I could have swore
       I heard him say

21:33.292 --> 21:34.724
moolah, moolah, moolah.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.528
Even the most native tribes
  must know about money.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.429
(Lucky)
'He looks like the village bum.'

21:39.498 --> 21:42.265
Moolah, moolah, moolah.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.967
I guess he's asking
      for a handout.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.203
Indeed.

21:46.271 --> 21:48.539
[speaking gibberish]

21:49.475 --> 21:50.875
Okey-dokey.

21:50.943 --> 21:54.745
How do you like that?
Even the natives are henpecked.

21:59.385 --> 22:02.819
I want to thank you all for
 coming here and seeing me off.

22:02.888 --> 22:06.057
Mr. Jackson, please.
Notify the authorities about us.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.726
Sure, we will.
                  Huh, boss?

22:16.502 --> 22:18.636
Nobody likes a wise guy.

22:21.407 --> 22:24.307
Alright, come on, slim.
    Give us a hand.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.110
[engine sputtering]

22:29.815 --> 22:32.083
Gilligan, give us the anchor.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.989
No, no.
            No, no.

22:39.058 --> 22:41.759
No, no. Don't throw it.
    Bring it to me.

22:50.603 --> 22:53.504
The money.
           The money!

22:59.811 --> 23:01.845
Stop the motor!
Stop the motor!

23:01.914 --> 23:04.382
The propeller is shooting
the money off the pits.

23:12.224 --> 23:15.325
It's all chopped up.
      It's all chopped up.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.628
Cheaters never prosper.

23:17.697 --> 23:19.730
I got to get
         that Gilligan.

23:21.633 --> 23:23.868
I got to give it
       to that Gilligan.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.770
Gun is wet, boss.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.338
Thanks for the information.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.976
The gun is full of water.
   Come on, let's get him.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.678
- Here they come, boss.
    - Let's get out of here.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.847
With Gilligan on that island,
 you can't win.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.154
[engine roaring]

23:45.024 --> 23:47.791
No use, Skipper.
We can't catch him.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.060
I guess you're right, Professor.

23:51.697 --> 23:54.198
I'm looking for the money
   and I think I got it.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.767
- I got it, I got it.
     - Well, take it out.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.340
(man on radio)
 'We interrupt this program
 to bring you a news bulletin.'

24:03.409 --> 24:06.076
'The coast guard has boarded
 the Sea Spray and apprehended'

24:06.145 --> 24:08.478
'Jackson Farrell and his
    gang of bank robbers.'

24:08.547 --> 24:10.147
Hey, Skipper.
         Skipper.

24:10.216 --> 24:12.349
'The authorities were unable
  to locate any of the loot'

24:12.418 --> 24:15.319
'from the Monarch Bank holdup
 but members of the gang'

24:15.387 --> 24:17.988
'confessed and Jackson Farrell
 and his men are being'

24:18.056 --> 24:19.890
'brought back
   for further questioning.'

24:19.959 --> 24:21.792
The coastguard got 'em.
         Good for them.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.728
Yeah, they'll put 'em in jail
where they belong.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.329
What are you doing?

24:26.398 --> 24:29.032
I went skin diving the rest
of the money, all the pieces.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.968
Boy! It's just some big build.
I have never seen so many zeros.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.070
And what is it
         you're doing with them?

24:34.139 --> 24:37.140
I'm gonna make
 one long million dollar bill.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.876
Hey, Skipper.
Have one..

24:39.945 --> 24:43.214
Here have...
three thousand dollars.

24:44.850 --> 24:46.617
Thanks, little buddy.

<i> ["The Ballad</i>
     <i> of Gilligan's Isle"]</i>

24:52.758 --> 24:53.957
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

24:54.026 --> 24:56.693
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

24:56.762 --> 24:59.195
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:59.264 --> 25:01.031
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

25:01.100 --> 25:03.333
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

25:03.402 --> 25:05.402
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:05.471 --> 25:07.537
¶ To make
    the others comfortable ¶

25:07.606 --> 25:09.807
¶ In their tropic island nest ¶

25:09.876 --> 25:12.142
¶ No phones, no lights,
    no motorcars ¶

25:12.211 --> 25:14.310
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:14.379 --> 25:16.313
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:16.382 --> 25:18.616
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:18.684 --> 25:20.617
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:20.686 --> 25:22.786
¶ You're sure
        to get a smile ¶

25:22.855 --> 25:25.455
¶ For seven
      stranded castaways ¶

25:25.524 --> 25:27.591
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
