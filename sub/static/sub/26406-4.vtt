WEBVTT

00:02.705 --> 00:04.329
<i>I'm sorry, the company doesn't consider</i>

00:04.330 --> 00:05.436
<i>pregnancy a disability.</i>

00:05.437 --> 00:07.834
No, I'm not asking for disability.

00:07.835 --> 00:10.459
I just need to reduce my hours

00:10.460 --> 00:12.469
because my doctor says
I have to stay off my feet.

00:12.469 --> 00:14.770
Yeah, her feet are really swollen.

00:14.805 --> 00:17.842
You know when you open a can
of Pillsbury crescent rolls

00:17.842 --> 00:20.245
and the dough just
kind of bursts through?

00:20.267 --> 00:23.202
Well, it's like that
only with feet and toes.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.793
<i>I can try getting you in with
a company-approved doctor.</i>

00:25.794 --> 00:29.633
<i>Have you been experiencing any bleeding,
spotting, or vaginal discharge?</i>

00:29.634 --> 00:32.329
Okay, I am just gonna do some paperwork.

00:32.330 --> 00:35.658
Um, yes, there has been
some discharge...

00:35.692 --> 00:38.260
♪ Oh, this is the way
we stape the pape ♪

00:38.295 --> 00:40.162
♪ Stape the pape, stape the pape ♪

00:40.197 --> 00:41.464
But nothing to write home about.

00:41.498 --> 00:42.865
<i>Alright, I can get you in</i>

00:42.899 --> 00:45.006
<i>for an appointment as soon as...</i>

00:45.007 --> 00:45.994
<i>December 15th.</i>

00:46.669 --> 00:49.530
December 15th?
That's like six weeks away.

00:49.531 --> 00:51.774
I will already have my baby by then.

00:51.808 --> 00:54.777
<i>Oh, next time call us
farther in advance.</i>

00:54.811 --> 00:57.212
<i>Is there anything else
I can help you with today?</i>

00:57.212 --> 00:59.515
Well, actually, while we
have you on the line...

00:59.549 --> 01:01.663
Ah, here, do some paperwork.

01:03.117 --> 01:07.665
I accidentally swallowed a
watermelon seed the other day.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.565
<i>And corporate sent us</i>

01:15.572 --> 01:19.043
some sort of newfangled
automatic cart collector.

01:19.044 --> 01:20.736
They say it's part of a...

01:20.771 --> 01:23.742
pilot program.

01:23.743 --> 01:26.266
I'm sorry, what are you supposed to be?

01:26.267 --> 01:27.615
The back of a horse.

01:27.616 --> 01:29.014
Jerry was supposed to be the front,

01:29.015 --> 01:31.823
but he's in Fort Lauderdale with Carol.

01:31.824 --> 01:32.549
Oh.

01:32.550 --> 01:35.204
Hey, you two, you can
flirt on your own time.

01:35.205 --> 01:38.232
Next order of business,
we're going to be holding

01:38.233 --> 01:41.101
an employee costume competition today.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.871
Oh, in honor of Halloween?

01:43.905 --> 01:46.807
Yep, yep. Because of Halloween.

01:46.841 --> 01:50.070
Um, so at the end of
the day we'll all vote

01:50.071 --> 01:52.906
who wore it best, and the winner gets...

01:58.779 --> 02:00.980
A fully paid vacation day.

02:01.014 --> 02:03.149
- What?
- Ohh.

02:03.183 --> 02:04.517
- I want that.
- Yeah.

02:04.551 --> 02:06.085
There's a day off?

02:06.119 --> 02:07.856
Wait, why didn't you tell
us there was a day off?

02:07.857 --> 02:09.024
I would have dressed up.

02:09.059 --> 02:10.493
That's not a costume?

02:10.526 --> 02:12.195
I thought you were
a dirty pile of laundry.

02:12.229 --> 02:14.731
I'm sorry I was too
exhausted to get dressed.

02:14.765 --> 02:16.833
My feet are so swollen
I can barely stand.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.601
I'm more pregnant
than you and I'm doing great.

02:18.636 --> 02:21.271
Yeah, my hair is silkier,
my skin's glowing,

02:21.305 --> 02:23.172
I just grew a new tooth.

02:23.207 --> 02:24.556
I'm doing very well.

02:32.349 --> 02:34.050
I really wanna win this contest.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.784
People are gonna know
I'm Super Mario, right?

02:35.818 --> 02:38.179
Not just some fat plumber.
I think people will get it.

02:38.262 --> 02:39.757
And you should keep that mustache.

02:39.778 --> 02:40.820
It really works for you.

02:40.821 --> 02:42.490
Oh, yeah, I was thinking of growing one.

02:42.525 --> 02:43.958
You should, you should.
It brings out your eyes.

02:43.993 --> 02:45.293
Yeah, thank you.

02:45.327 --> 02:47.829
Do you think they're
gonna know what I am?

02:47.863 --> 02:50.231
Oh yeah. So great, so smart.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.634
You know what it is, right?

02:52.668 --> 02:53.655
Yeah, totally.

02:54.437 --> 02:55.737
I'm "Gerry Mander."

02:55.771 --> 02:57.745
These are all gerrymander districts.

02:57.752 --> 02:59.744
Yeah, no. I know that. Totally.

02:59.759 --> 03:01.896
It's very intelligent.

03:01.897 --> 03:03.445
Yeah, thanks.

03:06.196 --> 03:07.600
Woo! This follows you anywhere?

03:07.601 --> 03:09.098
As long as you're holding the fob.

03:09.133 --> 03:10.341
Okay, this is crazy.

03:10.342 --> 03:11.768
How do we have this but, like,

03:11.802 --> 03:13.249
have still never been to the sun.

03:13.250 --> 03:15.338
Hey, if you swallow the fob,
will the collector

03:15.372 --> 03:17.306
just follow you until you poop it out?

03:17.341 --> 03:19.722
That is such a good question.

03:19.722 --> 03:20.804
I'll reach out to the manufacturer.

03:20.805 --> 03:21.941
- Yeah.
- Dina!

03:21.942 --> 03:23.978
What do I do? Should I jump the railing?

03:23.979 --> 03:24.680
No, no, stay there.

03:24.681 --> 03:26.086
This will be a teachable moment.

03:26.087 --> 03:27.262
No!

03:27.263 --> 03:28.818
<i>Happy Halloween.</i>

03:28.819 --> 03:34.359
<i>Check out our great deals
on batteries if you dare.</i>

03:35.481 --> 03:38.449
I'll give you a hint,
it's slightly political.

03:39.159 --> 03:40.117
Gay Spiderman.

03:43.087 --> 03:46.456
This is like the fifth time
they've played this song today.

03:46.491 --> 03:48.292
I hate how they just keep looping

03:48.326 --> 03:51.161
the same Halloween music
over and over again.

03:51.195 --> 03:53.230
At this point I've learned
how to just block out

03:53.264 --> 03:54.631
the most annoying stuff around here.

03:54.666 --> 03:56.867
You're like one of those monks in Tibet.

03:56.901 --> 03:59.803
You know, they practice
this meditation technique

03:59.837 --> 04:00.971
called Tummo.

04:01.005 --> 04:02.806
Garret, are you...

04:02.840 --> 04:05.946
Oh I get it. 'Cause I'm annoying.

04:05.947 --> 04:07.914
Yeah, all right.

04:07.949 --> 04:10.083
You made your point.

04:10.118 --> 04:12.953
Yeah, well, you know what?
You're annoying, so...

04:12.987 --> 04:15.222
I'm gonna ignore you.

04:17.492 --> 04:19.892
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

04:19.927 --> 04:21.762
Toro, Toro.

04:24.165 --> 04:25.265
Yeah!

04:25.300 --> 04:26.752
What are you doing?

04:26.754 --> 04:27.800
Playing matador.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.988
This thing is so cool.
You wanna see how it works?

04:30.022 --> 04:33.057
No, I don't want to see how it works.

04:33.092 --> 04:34.492
While you guys
have been out here playing

04:34.527 --> 04:36.728
with this fart collector, you know,

04:36.762 --> 04:39.386
the costume aisle
has turned into a war zone.

04:39.387 --> 04:41.166
Can you please go back inside?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.442
But I haven't had a turn yet at the...

04:44.336 --> 04:46.597
It's okay.
I'll just come early tomorrow.

04:46.894 --> 04:48.462
Please skedaddle.

04:50.000 --> 04:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:01.641 --> 05:04.443
Oh, you changed costumes.

05:04.790 --> 05:06.660
So did you.

05:06.661 --> 05:08.878
Well, I guess we both need
that vacation day, huh?

05:08.879 --> 05:12.001
Yeah, well, my feet are
giant balloons full of blood

05:12.002 --> 05:14.342
and I have a little
monster inside of me.

05:14.343 --> 05:15.909
I wanna see that new
Johnny English movie.

05:15.910 --> 05:18.548
Man, Cheyenne really stepped it up.

05:18.549 --> 05:21.105
- Oh, mahalo.
- She changed too?

05:21.140 --> 05:22.223
It's so sad.

05:22.758 --> 05:24.530
She probably thinks that looking sexy

05:24.531 --> 05:26.447
is going to help her win
the contest or something.

05:26.448 --> 05:29.402
Well that's not gonna work, right?

05:29.403 --> 05:31.430
Are you kidding me?

05:31.431 --> 05:34.316
I think everybody else
can kiss that day off "aloha."

05:34.317 --> 05:35.546
The goodbye meaning.

05:35.547 --> 05:37.558
Cheyenne can kiss it "aloha,"
hello meaning.

05:37.560 --> 05:39.700
What a kooky language.

05:42.600 --> 05:47.592
Aloha, girl. That costume is amazing.

05:47.675 --> 05:49.176
Awh, thanks.

05:49.210 --> 05:52.025
The coconuts and the grass

05:52.026 --> 05:55.792
and the belly button that I can see.

05:55.793 --> 05:57.327
I'm literally obsessed with you.

05:57.328 --> 05:59.486
You're literally in danger.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.643
I was wondering though,
do you think that maybe

06:02.644 --> 06:06.092
this costume might
be objectifying women?

06:06.127 --> 06:08.161
Huh. You know, I can see that.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.777
Like, do you really
want men gawking at you

06:10.778 --> 06:11.898
like you're some piece of meat?

06:11.899 --> 06:13.414
- Yeah.
- Kinda.

06:15.602 --> 06:16.300
Okay.

06:16.945 --> 06:18.356
And I was also thinking

06:18.820 --> 06:22.199
that maybe this costume is offensive

06:22.977 --> 06:25.512
to, um, Hawaiian people.

06:26.127 --> 06:27.561
Like Sandra. She's Hawaiian.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.758
Oh, good call.

06:28.759 --> 06:31.470
Don't worry, Sandra saw it
and she didn't say anything.

06:31.471 --> 06:32.704
It's also just wasteful

06:32.737 --> 06:34.872
'cause that's not what coconuts...

06:35.412 --> 06:35.971
Yeah.

06:35.972 --> 06:37.991
People are starving
around the world and...

06:37.992 --> 06:39.910
Well, someone ate the coconut.

06:39.911 --> 06:41.654
I just put it on my boob.

06:42.179 --> 06:43.420
Who ate the coconut?

06:43.971 --> 06:47.353
I don't know, someone at
a Thai restaurant or something.

06:51.180 --> 06:52.562
Hey man, why did you have to point out

06:52.596 --> 06:53.480
this stupid Halloween song?

06:53.481 --> 06:56.163
Now I can't tune it out.
It doesn't even make sense.

06:56.164 --> 06:58.635
"Dracula was putting
on moon tan lotion."

06:58.636 --> 07:00.288
Why is a Dracula at the beach?

07:00.289 --> 07:01.607
Yeah, it's not a good song.

07:01.608 --> 07:03.806
I'm just glad I'm not the only
one noticing it anymore.

07:03.807 --> 07:05.607
Okay, well next time,
keep it to yourself.

07:05.608 --> 07:07.654
Not everybody needs to notice
the same stuff.

07:07.655 --> 07:10.210
Why don't you just try
thinking of a different song?

07:10.211 --> 07:11.363
You know, like, um,

07:12.041 --> 07:13.073
you know...

07:16.076 --> 07:17.776
God, what are some songs?

07:19.093 --> 07:20.727
There she is.

07:20.762 --> 07:23.464
I thought someone might have
turned you into glue by now.

07:23.498 --> 07:24.298
Why?

07:24.332 --> 07:25.799
'Cause you're a horse.

07:26.461 --> 07:27.639
You know how they kill horses

07:27.640 --> 07:29.792
and turn their bones
and hooves into glue?

07:29.793 --> 07:30.536
They do?

07:30.537 --> 07:32.055
Nope, just being a goof.

07:32.056 --> 07:34.573
Hey, did you see Cheyenne's
hula costume?

07:34.635 --> 07:35.508
Yeah.

07:35.509 --> 07:38.057
That's not offensive to you
or anything, is it?

07:38.058 --> 07:39.567
Why would it be offensive?

07:39.568 --> 07:42.995
Oh, no, just that, you know,
some people might call it

07:43.311 --> 07:44.767
cultural appropriation.

07:45.505 --> 07:47.730
Just because reducing
your entire heritage

07:47.731 --> 07:49.663
to some cartoony stereotype

07:49.664 --> 07:51.689
might be disrespectful or something.

07:52.377 --> 07:53.551
She's just having fun.

07:53.552 --> 07:57.699
OMG. How cute is Cheyenne's hula outfit?

07:57.700 --> 08:01.351
Hawaiians are like "Laki-maki
laki-maki laki-maki."

08:01.352 --> 08:03.784
Actually, hula is a sacred...

08:03.785 --> 08:05.940
It's adorable.

08:05.941 --> 08:08.842
Oh, you guys, you're just such a cute,

08:09.533 --> 08:11.414
funny little people.

08:12.269 --> 08:12.884
Thanks.

08:15.226 --> 08:16.805
Oh. Oh, yeah.

08:17.761 --> 08:20.111
Oh! Ohh.

08:20.112 --> 08:22.883
Jonah! Jonah. Come here. Come here.

08:22.884 --> 08:23.931
Look. Okay, look.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.187
You're not going to believe
this but just watch.

08:36.936 --> 08:39.270
So fast. Good job, buddy.

08:39.304 --> 08:41.238
No, no, before...

08:41.272 --> 08:43.774
Now, I want it to be
spicy but not too spicy,

08:43.808 --> 08:47.244
like a step past ketchup
but not quite to mustard.

08:47.980 --> 08:49.416
Now I've had a "quesadillo"

08:49.417 --> 08:52.115
and I've had a "chimi-Chang-a,"
and I like them,

08:52.150 --> 08:54.751
but Gary, now, he likes
a cream tuna on noodles.

08:54.786 --> 08:57.154
I always say to him,
"live a little, Gary."

08:57.188 --> 08:58.524
God, I can't take it!

08:58.957 --> 08:59.988
Oh, sorry.

09:01.159 --> 09:03.293
Excuse me, I'm looking for a "salza."

09:03.328 --> 09:04.825
What the hell was that?

09:05.856 --> 09:07.969
This same song keeps
playing over and over again,

09:07.970 --> 09:10.234
and it's starting to drive me crazy.

09:10.268 --> 09:11.768
Oh, I like hearing the same song.

09:11.803 --> 09:13.770
You always know what you're
getting, no surprises.

09:13.805 --> 09:16.081
My workout mix is just
12 tracks of Billy Joel's

09:16.081 --> 09:17.195
"For the Longest Time."

09:17.196 --> 09:18.123
Well, that's on leg days.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.984
On arm days it's "Scenes
From an Italian Restaurant."

09:21.815 --> 09:24.253
She can't even be in the contest now.

09:24.254 --> 09:24.996
I feel bad.

09:25.594 --> 09:27.359
Well, you had to say something.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.140
It was obviously bothering you.

09:29.141 --> 09:32.509
Yeah, I love Cheyenne but
she needed to be called out.

09:32.974 --> 09:34.773
Maybe I'm being too sensitive.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.636
I mean, Janet's half-Jamaican,

09:36.637 --> 09:38.890
and she's okay with Marcus' Rasta cap.

09:40.353 --> 09:43.242
Yeah, I don't love it, but
I figured it's just a costume.

09:43.243 --> 09:45.158
Just a costume?

09:46.192 --> 09:48.420
Your culture is not some costume

09:48.421 --> 09:50.494
that Marcus can wear for laughs.

09:51.006 --> 09:51.898
Janet.

09:51.899 --> 09:54.449
- It doesn't end until we make it end.
- Yeah.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.278
We are the ones that
we've been waiting for.

09:57.962 --> 09:59.553
You know what? You're right.

09:59.554 --> 10:02.172
[bleep] that guy. Hey, Marcus!

10:03.640 --> 10:06.598
You'll find the sexy nurse
costumes in aisle nine

10:06.599 --> 10:09.596
between the sexy Minions
and the sexy sandwiches.

10:09.597 --> 10:12.795
Hey, Glenn, I think you left
that in the parking lot.

10:14.300 --> 10:15.284
Thank you.

10:15.976 --> 10:17.814
Good thing I'm not a real mailman.

10:17.821 --> 10:19.420
Leaving the mail in the parking lot?

10:19.421 --> 10:21.557
I would have been fired for sure.

10:21.558 --> 10:23.981
Ah, I think they would have let it slide

10:24.015 --> 10:25.123
since it's your first day.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.605
Jonah, no offense, but you know

10:26.606 --> 10:29.866
absolutely nothing about
the U.S. Postal Service.

10:39.065 --> 10:41.633
Hey, Sayid, I just wanted
to check in and see

10:41.702 --> 10:44.459
you're feeling about
Chris' Aladdin costume.

10:44.460 --> 10:46.607
How ya holding up with the racism?

10:46.608 --> 10:49.230
I mean, it just seems
to me like her costume

10:49.264 --> 10:52.233
is a slap in the face
to your Latino culture.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.468
Sayid should know better.

10:54.503 --> 10:56.804
I'm sure as a person of German heritage

10:56.838 --> 10:58.272
this is very offensive.

10:58.306 --> 11:00.441
Well, I'm not German.
I'm French-Canadian.

11:00.475 --> 11:03.344
Well, did you see Teddy is
dressed as a hockey player?

11:03.378 --> 11:05.763
Can you believe
that banjo he's carrying?

11:05.763 --> 11:08.991
As if all southerners are just
toothless backwater rednecks.

11:08.992 --> 11:09.683
That offend you?

11:09.684 --> 11:11.519
I think he's supposed
to be Steve Martin.

11:12.251 --> 11:15.035
"I think he's
supposed to be Steve Martin."

11:15.064 --> 11:16.998
That's what you sound like.

11:17.307 --> 11:19.290
Okay, the problem is the same song

11:19.325 --> 11:20.689
keeps playing every ten minutes.

11:20.690 --> 11:21.980
Same song, all day long.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.549
<i>Well, I doubt any customers
are sticking around all day.</i>

11:24.550 --> 11:26.887
Yeah, but I am. I'm here all day long.

11:26.888 --> 11:28.341
All day long, same song.

11:28.342 --> 11:29.891
It's starting to become a little much.

11:29.892 --> 11:31.950
<i>Oh, if this is about
employee satisfaction,</i>

11:31.951 --> 11:33.134
<i>I can transfer you over to...</i>

11:33.135 --> 11:35.838
No, do not transfer me.

11:35.839 --> 11:38.209
I have been transferred
to six different departments

11:38.244 --> 11:39.607
in four different countries.

11:39.609 --> 11:42.101
I don't understand why it takes
an international coalition

11:42.102 --> 11:43.454
to control a playlist.

11:43.455 --> 11:44.739
Which is something
that I have been doing

11:44.740 --> 11:46.634
for ten years with no problems.

11:46.635 --> 11:48.902
Nobody got hurt, then all of
a sudden you guys takeover

11:48.903 --> 11:51.185
and it's "Halloween Surfboard."

11:51.186 --> 11:54.570
"Halloween Surfboard." It's just stupid!

11:56.405 --> 11:57.319
<i>Please hold.</i>

12:02.125 --> 12:05.152
The expiration date said July 2023,

12:05.153 --> 12:07.675
and I was like,
"I might expire by then."

12:09.516 --> 12:12.836
That's what's so great about,
you know, canned goods,

12:12.837 --> 12:14.662
'cause, you know, they're in cans.

12:14.663 --> 12:15.435
Stop.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.502
Okay, keep... keep walking.

12:18.503 --> 12:20.589
Again, I'm just looking
for water chestnuts.

12:20.590 --> 12:21.120
Um huh.

12:21.121 --> 12:22.559
You can just tell me
what aisle they're in.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.490
Not right now!

12:30.963 --> 12:33.785
Now, do we think that
Freddy is just a pirate

12:33.786 --> 12:35.342
or is he a Somali pirate?

12:35.343 --> 12:37.094
Because that would be messed up.

12:37.095 --> 12:38.903
You are a real hero, you know that?

12:38.904 --> 12:40.778
You're like a voice for the voiceless.

12:40.779 --> 12:41.915
Hey, we have a problem.

12:41.916 --> 12:43.158
You need to take that costume off.

12:43.159 --> 12:43.838
What? Why?

12:43.839 --> 12:45.733
We've had a complaint about this whole

12:45.734 --> 12:48.079
Italian minstrel show
you've got going on.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.154
No, I'm no... I'm Mario.

12:51.260 --> 12:54.389
You know. It's a me, Mario!

12:55.082 --> 12:57.288
My brother is a' Luigi!

12:57.323 --> 12:58.997
Hey, you need to stop right now.

12:58.998 --> 13:01.067
Why? I mean, who would even...

13:02.306 --> 13:04.467
I can't believe you
complained about my costume

13:04.468 --> 13:05.683
just to win the contest.

13:05.684 --> 13:07.256
It had nothing to do with the contest.

13:07.258 --> 13:08.904
I was legitimately offended.

13:08.905 --> 13:11.333
Oh, please. Marcus, you're Italian.

13:11.334 --> 13:12.688
Mario's okay, right?

13:12.973 --> 13:14.464
I've actually thought a lot about this.

13:14.465 --> 13:16.981
I mean, for me personally,
"Super Mario Brothers"

13:16.982 --> 13:19.610
is a classic. "Mario Kart," also solid.

13:19.611 --> 13:22.242
But "Mario Party?"
It's like, what happened?

13:23.089 --> 13:24.988
See? Marcus is fine with it.

13:24.989 --> 13:26.393
Oh, that makes sense.

13:26.394 --> 13:28.573
Yeah, I guess we can all
start telling racist jokes

13:28.575 --> 13:30.604
as long as one person
from that race signs off.

13:30.605 --> 13:31.606
Is that true?

13:31.607 --> 13:33.416
My Jewish bird joke is so good,

13:33.417 --> 13:35.749
and I think you'll feel like
we're laughing with you.

13:35.816 --> 13:36.663
Still no.

13:36.664 --> 13:38.329
Ugh, it's so good.

13:38.364 --> 13:40.170
All Amy is saying is people need to stop

13:40.171 --> 13:41.933
looking for a reason to be offended.

13:41.967 --> 13:42.729
Exactly.

13:42.730 --> 13:45.060
I mean, you can't even sing NWA anymore

13:45.061 --> 13:47.122
without being asked to leave a cookout.

13:47.368 --> 13:48.836
That is...

13:48.837 --> 13:50.805
not what I was saying.

14:02.636 --> 14:04.916
I don't understand why Amy's
allowed to wear a mustache

14:04.917 --> 14:06.412
but I can't wear my dreadlocks.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.975
And I can't wear a grass
skirt and coconut boobs.

14:08.976 --> 14:12.397
Let her wear the coconut
boobs, you monsters.

14:12.398 --> 14:15.745
It's because those costumes
objectify a whole culture.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.332
I am not dressed as an Italian.

14:18.333 --> 14:22.139
I am dressed as a character
who happens to be Italian.

14:22.140 --> 14:25.709
So I'm not allowed to
dress up as a Jamaican,

14:25.710 --> 14:28.166
but if I'm dressing up as Bob Marley,

14:28.167 --> 14:30.032
who happens to be Jamaican,

14:30.622 --> 14:32.584
Then everything be irie, Mon.

14:32.585 --> 14:34.174
- No.
- What's the difference?

14:34.175 --> 14:36.085
It's just... it's different.

14:36.086 --> 14:37.755
Jonah, I feel like you
can explain this better.

14:37.790 --> 14:38.818
Well, I know it's different,

14:38.819 --> 14:41.772
I'm just having trouble
putting into words why, uh...

14:41.924 --> 14:44.133
Janet, could you explain it to them?

14:44.134 --> 14:44.986
Why me?

14:44.987 --> 14:47.849
No reason, just, you know stuff.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.306
It's no different.

14:49.307 --> 14:51.285
If we let Amy wear that costume,

14:51.286 --> 14:53.636
then we might as well let
Marcus wear blackface.

14:53.637 --> 14:55.463
- That's offense.
- That would be awesome.

14:55.470 --> 14:56.735
No, it is not the same thing.

14:56.736 --> 14:57.866
Wait, hold on, wait.

14:57.867 --> 15:00.678
Why can't I paint my face
to look like Bob Marley

15:00.713 --> 15:03.094
but Elias can paint his
to look like a Smurf.

15:03.095 --> 15:06.463
You can't just... there's
a whole history...

15:07.581 --> 15:09.215
- Janet?
- Yeah?

15:09.649 --> 15:10.823
Nothing, I'm just checking in.

15:10.824 --> 15:11.960
How you doing? Are you good?

15:11.961 --> 15:13.178
Okay, you know what?

15:13.179 --> 15:15.447
This is getting too complicated.

15:15.794 --> 15:17.438
Let's just cancel the contest.

15:17.439 --> 15:18.510
- What?
- No!

15:18.511 --> 15:21.588
It's not worth upsetting
everybody over one day off work.

15:23.867 --> 15:28.422
We can't just live our lives
afraid to offend someone.

15:28.423 --> 15:31.489
I think that we, you know, as a society,

15:31.490 --> 15:33.437
we need to just lighten up a little bit.

15:33.438 --> 15:35.638
Yeah, I mean really, if I think about it

15:35.900 --> 15:40.066
Mario is a hardworking plumber
that rescues princesses.

15:40.413 --> 15:43.321
If anything, that costume
honors Italians.

15:43.355 --> 15:45.647
- Yes.
- So I can wear

15:45.648 --> 15:48.984
my hula outfit
if I'm honoring Hawaiians.

15:50.035 --> 15:52.731
Yea... I mean I guess if you feel like

15:52.732 --> 15:56.021
it's about honoring the culture
and not just to look sexy.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.544
Yup, I'm honoring the culture.

15:57.545 --> 15:59.283
And I can wear my Rasta hat

15:59.284 --> 16:01.063
if it's about honoring Jamaicans.

16:01.655 --> 16:04.336
Well, I mean, I guess if we're saying

16:04.337 --> 16:05.714
that it's all or nothing,

16:05.715 --> 16:08.768
then I can't really think
of a reason to say no.

16:08.769 --> 16:10.425
Bumbaclot!

16:10.426 --> 16:12.512
Okay then, contest back on.

16:13.066 --> 16:14.599
- Yes.
- Great.

16:14.823 --> 16:17.658
Have you been wearing that
under your shirt all day?

16:17.692 --> 16:19.907
Yeah, I don't know how you do it.

16:24.418 --> 16:25.904
Hello, St. Louis!

16:25.905 --> 16:29.354
Welcome to Cloud 9 store 1217's
2018 Halloween

16:29.389 --> 16:33.058
official employee costume
competition royale.

16:33.092 --> 16:34.660
Yeah!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.061
All right.

16:36.095 --> 16:40.732
Let's meet our first
contestant, Marcus White!

16:44.037 --> 16:48.207
One love! Everything irie.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.509
But I'll tell you what isn't Irie.

16:50.543 --> 16:54.246
Nearly 700,000 Africans
brought to Jamaica as slaves.

16:54.812 --> 16:58.884
The Rastafari movement isn't
about ganja and bobsleds.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.987
It's about resisting the
tyranny of white oppressors.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.690
Perhaps just like you.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.659
Thanks, and happy Halloween.

17:14.857 --> 17:17.201
Oh, good. I thought you were...

17:17.683 --> 17:18.911
What's this?

17:18.938 --> 17:20.906
I gotta cover up the ceiling speakers.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.507
The key is to get sweaters thick enough

17:22.541 --> 17:24.209
to block out the sound.
The tighter the knit,

17:24.243 --> 17:26.044
the less "Halloween
Surfboard" gets through.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.012
Yeah, okay, good. Hey, listen.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.681
You know technology, right?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.216
Like you're plugged in, so, um,

17:31.251 --> 17:34.052
where are we on the timeline
of robots having feelings,

17:34.087 --> 17:36.688
like, you know, anger or vengeance?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.523
I mean, is that happening yet?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.759
Yeah, I don't know, maybe.
You know, could be.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.012
Oh. Good. Good to know.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.432
One up!

17:47.467 --> 17:49.768
It's a me, a Mario!

17:49.802 --> 17:51.970
I eatsa the pasta.

17:52.005 --> 17:54.072
But Italians are so much more

17:54.107 --> 17:56.241
than just spaghetti and meatballs.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.910
From the beginning of time,
white women have honored us

17:58.945 --> 18:01.480
with their contributions
to science and the arts.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.449
A bell rang out through
the city of Dolores.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.286
Gong! Gong!

18:07.320 --> 18:09.588
Known as the land beyond the forest,

18:09.622 --> 18:13.158
Transylvania is rich in natural splendor

18:13.192 --> 18:15.294
and mineral resources.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.096
Eleanor Roosevelt. Joy Behar.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.631
Marie Curie. Madonna.

18:19.666 --> 18:23.001
Brainy Smurf's special
talent is his brain.

18:23.036 --> 18:27.005
There is the Sistine Chapel,
penne arrabbiata.

18:27.040 --> 18:30.242
You pour the vinegar in...

18:30.276 --> 18:32.277
And the lava comes out.

18:35.014 --> 18:38.016
Viva Morelos! Viva Allende!

18:38.051 --> 18:40.252
Viva Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez!

18:40.286 --> 18:42.988
Jokey Smurf, he tells jokes.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.157
He's funny. He's the funny one.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.992
Gerrymandering may present

18:47.026 --> 18:49.828
the most grave threat to our democracy.

18:52.332 --> 18:56.034
The Venice canals and,
uh, mozzarella sticks.

18:56.069 --> 18:57.469
If you look back

18:57.503 --> 19:00.372
to the midterm election
results of 2006...

19:00.406 --> 19:01.073
Shoot your web.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.675
Oh, no, I'm not Spider-Man.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.767
Shoot it anyway.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.114
Thwip.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.483
Nice.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.055
Attention Cloud 9 shoppers,
I do not have an announcement,

19:17.090 --> 19:19.624
but as long as I am talking
I am not listening,

19:19.659 --> 19:21.626
so just gotta keep talking.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.329
Uh, save 30% off roach gel.

19:24.364 --> 19:26.198
Stop roaches in their tracks.

19:26.232 --> 19:28.300
Except you can never really
stop them, can you?

19:28.334 --> 19:30.168
They'll just keep coming and coming,

19:30.203 --> 19:32.170
invading your mind in an endless loop.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.805
Are we there yet, Daddy?

19:33.840 --> 19:37.442
Sorry, son, the hell
ride, it lasts forever.

19:39.078 --> 19:41.346
It's buy one, get one free on peas.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.088
I just want you to know that I actually

19:50.123 --> 19:51.757
really do like your costume.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.425
Thanks. I like yours, too.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.727
Do you wanna hold hands
like in Miss America?

19:55.762 --> 19:56.900
Not really.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.777
I actually don't like your costume.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.631
And the winner of one day
off work with pay

20:03.706 --> 20:06.973
and this small bowling trophy
because it's all we had...

20:07.940 --> 20:09.505
Amy Sosa!

20:09.506 --> 20:11.712
Yes!

20:11.713 --> 20:13.779
Yes!

20:13.813 --> 20:16.915
In! Yo! Face! In yo face!

20:16.949 --> 20:18.884
Yes,

20:18.918 --> 20:20.852
I would like to accept this award

20:20.887 --> 20:23.622
on behalf of the Italian people.

20:29.295 --> 20:32.097
<i>Jerusha, I want you to go pack a go-bag,</i>

20:32.131 --> 20:34.699
<i>and go outside, wait by the mailbox,</i>

20:34.734 --> 20:36.802
<i>and when you see my car,
get a running start</i>

20:36.836 --> 20:38.570
<i>and then jump through the window, okay?</i>

20:38.604 --> 20:40.439
<i>Because I am not
going to be able to stop.</i>

20:40.473 --> 20:42.107
<i>Oh, and see if any of our neighbors</i>

20:42.141 --> 20:43.742
<i>have a shotgun you can borrow.</i>

20:43.776 --> 20:44.914
<i>I'll see you soon.</i>

20:45.778 --> 20:48.079
So how much did I win by?

20:48.114 --> 20:50.449
Was it, like, a landslide?
You can tell me.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.269
Oh, it was a total landslide,
for Cheyenne.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.352
What?

20:54.387 --> 20:56.621
I mean, her boob
accidentally popped out.

20:56.656 --> 20:57.789
You can't compete with that.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.675
Wait, did you cheat for me?

21:02.528 --> 21:03.762
Mm-hmm.

21:03.796 --> 21:04.732
Nice.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.265
It's kinda fitting, don't you think,

21:08.148 --> 21:11.470
that I actually ended
up suppressing votes?

21:12.338 --> 21:14.439
'Cause it, uh, 'cause I'm Gerry Mander.

21:14.474 --> 21:15.789
- Mm-hmm.
- You get it.
