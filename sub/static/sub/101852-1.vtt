04:41.448 --> 04:42.483
You okay, sir?

04:44.242 --> 04:45.242
Yeah, Joe.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.072
Just a bit further, sir.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.172
Little blue, little blue, over.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.346
Little blue, little blue, over.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.894
Little blue, little blue,
can anyone hear me?

05:15.190 --> 05:16.225
Come back, please.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.882
Any luck?

05:42.759 --> 05:45.842
I don't know, sir. The battery's
just not liking the cold.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.628
Deader than a can of corned beef, sir.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.093
- Can you fix it?
- Well, depends.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.007
If we can get the battery

05:52.310 --> 05:53.891
to warm up, we might have a chance.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.605
Jason?

06:00.485 --> 06:01.645
Nothing, sir.

06:01.945 --> 06:04.687
I bet if we get to higher ground,
we might have better luck.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.772
The whole damn German army behind us

06:07.784 --> 06:09.570
and we don't have a radio that works.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.823
All right, I'm gonna go give it a try.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.199
Orders, if we can't get out
of here in 10 minutes,

06:17.502 --> 06:20.335
salvage what you can and destroy the rest.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.121
Don't leave anything for the Germans.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.249
Sir, yes sir.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.042
Mark, why don't you flip the lights on

06:28.054 --> 06:30.420
for a minute and see if that warms it up.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.724
All right.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.601
How's that?

06:33.685 --> 06:35.641
Yeah, just give it a few minutes.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.466
- Oh, shit.
- Any luck?

07:09.763 --> 07:10.297
I don't know, I didn't get a clear look.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.037
Jack, I'm asking
you if they saw you.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.713
I don't know, I don't know, okay?
I don't know.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.797
Corporal, they gotta be coming.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.289
- We need to fight 'em off.
- Shut up.

07:17.562 --> 07:18.972
Hey, what's your name?

07:19.272 --> 07:20.637
Shut the hell up, would ya? Okay?

07:22.067 --> 07:23.947
If you give away our
position, then we're dead.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.361
- We can't just stay here.
- I know, I know.

07:29.407 --> 07:31.398
All right, here's the deal. Listen up.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.862
I want a perimeter spread
out down this tree line.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.778
Tight and quiet, nobody
shoots unless I do, got it?

07:37.916 --> 07:38.996
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, go.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.454
Take it easy, you understand me?

07:42.754 --> 07:43.960
Yeah, I heard him.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.170
Damn 106th transfers
are a pain in the ass.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.470
Yeah, no shit.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.686
Hey, keep that bar down,
we're laying low this time.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.267
- What's going on?
- Germans.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.648
- What?
- The Germans.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.395
- What, Nazis?
- Yeah, Nazis.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.098
You're a man of few words, chief.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.441
- Hey hunt, gimme one.
- Yeah, yeah, me too, me too.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.535
- It ain't time.
- Just take it from our count.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.831
Yeah, come on.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.157
- They better all be in here.
- They are.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.950
- What about a light?
- Shut up.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.837
The hell with that.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.280
What the fuck?

09:39.037 --> 09:40.527
- Piece of shit.
- Put it down.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.616
What the hell is that?

10:06.397 --> 10:07.682
Piece of shit jammed on me.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.266
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.193
Look at me, all right? Look at me!

10:15.615 --> 10:18.573
Follow my orders or I'm gonna
fucking kill you, got it?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.443
Yes corporal, sure.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.746
- All right.
- I got it.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.162
Get your shit and let's go.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.577
Hey Jack, what do you
want me to do with this?

10:29.879 --> 10:32.837
Next time, try taking
off the damn safety.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.250
Listen to me. Look, you're
gonna get us all killed.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.804
Listen or we're all dead,
you understand me?

10:41.099 --> 10:42.219
I said do you understand me?

10:42.267 --> 10:44.599
Yes tech-corporal, I understand you.

12:28.998 --> 12:29.998
- Sir.
- Haas.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.957
Has general Omar Bradley arrived yet?

12:36.256 --> 12:37.256
No, sir. Not yet.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.508
But we have everything set
up, just like you asked.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.803
Updates?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.715
Reports keep pouring in.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.931
Sector h is withdrawing
all along our lines.

12:50.228 --> 12:52.139
The German 12th and 9th
panzer divisions seem

12:52.438 --> 12:55.930
to be in full force and knocking
on everyone's front door.

12:57.235 --> 12:59.351
All units reporting enemy contact.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.408
The spotting plane, is it ready?
Can it go up?

13:07.704 --> 13:10.741
We are working on it but the
weather still isn't ideal.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.040
All planes are grounded.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.033
Haas, I need to know
what's going on out there.

13:15.336 --> 13:17.497
I need aerial observation, come on.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.287
We will double our efforts, sir.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.553
You heard from captain Daniels?

13:27.849 --> 13:28.849
Not yet, sir.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.095
He hasn't reported.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.305
- He hasn't reported in yet?
- No, sir.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.854
What about lieutenant cappa?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.936
We haven't heard from him either, sir.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.521
This is the big one, isn't it, major?

13:46.659 --> 13:49.196
Well, we got our work
cut out for us, captain.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.495
Yes, sir.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.769
Give me a hit of that, chief.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.073
Chief?

14:26.616 --> 14:29.153
You know I'm Italian, right, not Indian?

14:29.452 --> 14:30.532
Wait, you're not Indian?

14:31.829 --> 14:32.829
No.

14:34.332 --> 14:37.199
Americanos never know the
difference between us, mi amigo.

14:37.502 --> 14:38.502
You're Mexican?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.545
No.

14:43.591 --> 14:44.911
Don't tie your boots too tight.

14:45.051 --> 14:45.631
You're gonna cut off circulation.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.166
You're not gonna be able to feel your feet.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.964
I can't feel my feet as it is already.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.349
- Jack.
- Hmm?

14:59.649 --> 15:00.934
You wanna turn it like this.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.402
You know back home,
whenever I went on a stroll

15:06.697 --> 15:09.609
in the woods or anything
like that, I'd always

15:09.909 --> 15:11.909
take a compass with me so
I could find my way out.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.203
Sure.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.116
My brother on the other hand,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.030
I mean he could find his
way out of anything.

15:18.042 --> 15:20.624
The kid would just use the sun, the woods,

15:20.920 --> 15:24.412
the stars, you name it,
I mean he was a Lewis.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.671
I was no Clark, let's put it that way.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.128
Right. Do you miss him?

15:29.679 --> 15:30.679
Yeah.

15:31.597 --> 15:32.928
I do.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.224
Is he in the service?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.923
Yeah, actually when this whole

15:37.103 --> 15:38.889
damn thing started, we enlisted together.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.908
I guess we thought we'd be in the same unit

15:41.107 --> 15:43.598
and you know the army,
they had different plans.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.391
Yeah well, I know how that goes.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.617
I found that out the day
I got the draft notice.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.109
Okay, you were drafted.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.274
- I was.
- Get outta here.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.443
I was a shoe salesman in Chicago.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.746
- No.
- Yeah.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.745
- Jack was a shoe salesman?
- That's right.

16:00.042 --> 16:01.452
Just crabby old ladies mostly.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.130
Maybe you should have this.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.387
Jack,

16:13.139 --> 16:15.630
you're doing fine, okay?

16:17.143 --> 16:18.143
Okay.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.761
All right, we gotta move. Tell the guys.

16:22.982 --> 16:23.982
Yes, corporal.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.734
Asshole.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.862
Little blue, little blue, over.

16:43.377 --> 16:46.335
Little blue, little blue,
anyone out there? Over.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.307
All right, try that.

16:58.476 --> 16:59.796
Shit, turn it off, turn it off.

16:59.936 --> 17:03.428
Hey, hey, hey, you killed my radio.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.722
You're the one using
all the juice, lefty.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.435
So what do we do now?

17:08.736 --> 17:09.736
Looks like we walk.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.035
Thank Jesus.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.284
You boys having some trouble?

17:25.086 --> 17:26.451
We're glad to see you, sir.

17:36.764 --> 17:37.879
What's wrong with her?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.181
Battery's dead.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.262
Yeah well, batteries don't like

17:42.562 --> 17:44.848
the cold much but then again, who does?

17:48.568 --> 17:49.978
The radio still work?

17:50.278 --> 17:51.278
When she's got juice.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.148
So if we were to go ahead
and give you a jump,

17:56.450 --> 17:58.190
she'd work just fine, huh?

17:58.494 --> 18:00.075
Yeah, I reckon it would.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.659
So you think you can give us a jump?

18:18.014 --> 18:20.721
Anybody else know you boys are out here?

18:21.017 --> 18:22.017
No.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.179
Just us.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.478
What's going on, sir?

18:37.033 --> 18:39.866
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.870
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:02.350 --> 19:04.591
Y'all can't even do it right.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.509
I really am sorry.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.105
All right boys, let's clean this puppy up.

19:13.235 --> 19:15.271
- English, please.
- Sorry, captain.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.856
What do we do with the bodies?

19:21.661 --> 19:22.661
Leave 'em.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.497
Yes sir.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.324
All right boys, let's go.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.710
We need boots on the ground in 20 minutes.

19:33.005 --> 19:36.042
I need this thing purring
like a goddamn cat.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.378
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.465
We got chili on the stove.
We got people to see.

19:46.102 --> 19:48.218
Jesus Christ almighty,
Mary, Joe and Joseph.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.516
Keep up.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.150
Damn thick snow.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.777
It ain't gonna get better.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.903
My damn feet, they're as cold as ice.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.656
I told you not to tie
your boots so tight.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.032
The bar was a bad choice.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.323
- How you do that?
- Old Indian secret.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.658
What secret?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.619
Don't volunteer to carry the bar.

20:57.715 --> 20:59.205
I have no idea.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.169
Well, the Germans could be anywhere.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.304
Loud as hell, corporal. I
can hear y'all for miles.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.267
Take it easy, fellas.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.676
Can't be too careful these days.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.561
Plenty of German patrols in the area.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.646
Why don't you come with us?

21:16.942 --> 21:18.478
We'll get you back to friendly lines.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.067
- Hot food?
- Sure, if we're lucky.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.404
Why don't you boys come along with us?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.694
We got a couple of jeeps
ready to take you back.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.340
All right, go on.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.840
- So what do you think?
- I don't know.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.973
Something feels funny.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.277
Coming, corporal?

22:04.573 --> 22:05.573
Yeah.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.109
Just tell 'em to keep their eyes open.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.412
Gott.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.231
What the fuck?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.570
Hey!

22:54.874 --> 22:55.874
Come on.

22:57.960 --> 22:58.960
Hurry up.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.610
You're one crazy cracker, you know that?

23:39.793 --> 23:41.158
Fire, fire.

23:41.462 --> 23:43.748
Hey, hey, hey, look
out, look out, look out.

24:22.878 --> 24:23.993
Lieutenant.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.401
Get me anything you can on
the whereabouts of the 755th

24:52.700 --> 24:57.160
and where the hell those goddamn
German panzer tanks are!

25:05.629 --> 25:07.540
Are you okay, son?

25:07.840 --> 25:10.001
My whole platoon is in the 755th.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.961
Our last communication was yesterday.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.512
Nothing.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.344
Listen up, son.

25:20.644 --> 25:22.225
Those boys you care about so much,

25:23.480 --> 25:25.016
they need you now more than ever.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.439
Understood?

25:27.735 --> 25:29.055
- Right, sir.
- Okay, lieutenant.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.609
You found out where they are

25:31.780 --> 25:33.691
and then get 'em back in the fight.

25:33.991 --> 25:34.991
Yes sir.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.113
All right, listen up, all of ya.

25:45.919 --> 25:48.786
We're still in this fight and I don't want

25:49.089 --> 25:52.798
to see any more defeated
faces around me, understood?

25:53.093 --> 25:54.093
Yes sir.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.012
All right, carry on.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.399
Attention!

26:10.694 --> 26:13.060
Continue gentlemen,
don't let me stop you.

26:14.156 --> 26:15.156
General.

26:16.867 --> 26:19.153
Looks like we are in the
thick of it, eh Mike?

26:20.245 --> 26:23.954
Well I hate to say so, Brad
but it would seem that way.

26:25.334 --> 26:28.326
Weather blew in a major
German offensive, eh?

26:28.629 --> 26:30.665
Yeah, a bitter cold wind.

26:33.634 --> 26:34.714
Give it to me straight.

26:38.764 --> 26:40.675
Well, all reports said the same thing.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.851
Infantry, tanks, artillery, everything

26:47.481 --> 26:50.723
and well, they're right
down the elsenborn road,

26:51.026 --> 26:54.109
they're coming down the Gavin
road and the andar bridge.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.355
You don't think this is a feint?

26:58.659 --> 27:01.275
No, it's not infantry doing
reconnaissance enforces.

27:01.578 --> 27:02.988
These are crack panzer divisions,

27:03.288 --> 27:05.199
I think Hitler's last reserves.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.205
And your division is in retreat?

27:10.921 --> 27:14.459
Well, tactical withdrawal,
we're referring it as.

27:15.592 --> 27:17.583
Do we have any available resistance?

27:17.886 --> 27:20.252
Any units that can muster a defense?

27:23.058 --> 27:24.639
No, only small isolated units,

27:24.935 --> 27:27.768
platoons, companies doing what
they can to stop the advance.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.059
I'm afraid that our flanks

27:32.359 --> 27:34.441
are exposed and they could surround us.

27:36.697 --> 27:37.697
Reserves?

27:39.867 --> 27:40.867
Unknown.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.526
I mean, we can't keep a comm wire up

27:43.829 --> 27:46.286
more than five minutes, much
less lay a new one down.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.115
If they have our flanks,

27:50.419 --> 27:51.955
then they can cross the meuse river.

27:54.298 --> 27:58.416
Right, and if they cross the meuse river,

27:58.719 --> 28:00.209
they can go all the way to antwerp

28:01.471 --> 28:06.010
and cut off the english channel
at our backs and separate us

28:06.310 --> 28:08.642
from the British who are
up in Holland on our left.

28:12.024 --> 28:14.356
Our armies would be
trapped behind German lines

28:15.944 --> 28:17.309
without any hope for resupply.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.692
Ike wants to know what I want to do.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.742
But I want to know what you want to do.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.996
- May I speak my mind?
- Speak it.

28:40.761 --> 28:42.968
It just doesn't make any sense.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.263
What doesn't?

28:45.974 --> 28:48.886
Well, if the Germans are
going to try to make it

28:49.186 --> 28:51.677
all the way to antwerp,
they're gonna have to refuel.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.641
Those panzers use a lot of fuel.

28:54.858 --> 28:55.858
Lieutenant.

28:58.528 --> 29:01.315
We need current fuel reserve
estimates of the German army.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.606
Hold on son, you're gonna want
to pay attention to this.

29:04.785 --> 29:05.825
We're making history here.

29:05.953 --> 29:07.318
If you're right, if he is right,

29:08.455 --> 29:09.653
then the Germans are
going to want to refuel

29:09.665 --> 29:11.530
with our gas which is, where is it?

29:13.543 --> 29:14.828
Well, our biggest reserve

29:15.128 --> 29:17.414
is right here, just north of lanzerath.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.757
Which is where?

29:20.550 --> 29:22.040
Right down the elsenborn road.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.382
I think you're onto
something there, Mike.

29:26.682 --> 29:28.013
Carry on.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.423
Get me those numbers, son.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.351
All right, you boys wait here.

29:33.647 --> 29:34.181
We'll go on ahead and see

29:34.481 --> 29:35.881
what we can do to help you all out.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.100
It just doesn't make any sense.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.184
I know, what the hell are these mps

29:41.196 --> 29:42.556
doing walking around in the woods?

29:42.656 --> 29:44.612
Yeah, and you see the
markings on that Jeep?

29:44.908 --> 29:46.148
Uh-huh.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.191
That's one of our headquarters jeeps.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.871
I mean it could be, there's
a lot of jeeps around.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.536
It could be a coincidence.

30:02.634 --> 30:03.634
Success?

30:03.760 --> 30:04.760
I got them out.

30:07.097 --> 30:07.802
Why are they here?

30:08.098 --> 30:10.058
Why didn't you just kill
'em and be done with it?

30:10.851 --> 30:12.182
These men might be useful.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.770
Fine.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.606
Keep 'em alive, for now.

30:23.905 --> 30:24.905
Yes, sir.

30:25.574 --> 30:29.237
Looks like I got you boys a ride.
Right this way.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.079
What about food?

30:32.914 --> 30:33.914
All you can eat.

30:41.048 --> 30:42.688
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.255
We don't have a choice now.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.551
Jack.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.801
Now you boys be sure to
keep your eyes peeled.

30:52.100 --> 30:54.432
Them Germans, they're everywhere.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.363
Welcome back, lieutenant.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.571
You're lucky. The bullet
barely grazed your side.

31:57.874 --> 31:59.284
I had to sew you up myself.

31:59.584 --> 32:02.041
Couple of days rest and you should be okay.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.622
Where am I?

32:03.922 --> 32:07.585
Field hospital, lanzerath,
or what's left of it.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.424
Thanks for fixing me up, ma'am.

32:13.723 --> 32:14.963
But I really gotta get going.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.467
You shouldn't be moving yet.

32:16.560 --> 32:17.891
The stitches need time to set.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.765
Lieutenant cappa can't die.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.851
He's got the lord on his side.

32:24.151 --> 32:25.391
Doc.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.480
It's good to see you too, sir.

32:27.779 --> 32:28.779
I found these.

32:34.578 --> 32:35.578
How?

32:36.288 --> 32:38.825
I was picked up by a patrol
and I was brought here.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.953
I decided to stick around
and help out where I could.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.205
I really appreciate the fix, ma'am.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.840
I just can't stop...
Here, you'll need this.

32:51.136 --> 32:53.422
Change the old with the
new in the next 24 hours.

32:54.347 --> 32:55.707
Harris has the command room set up

32:55.765 --> 32:58.006
in the mill house, you can't miss it.

32:58.310 --> 32:59.310
Who has command?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.847
- Sergeant Harris.
- No officers?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.103
I'm the ranking officer here, lieutenant

33:04.399 --> 33:06.606
but they don't take field
orders from nurses.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.485
Captain, I didn't mean-

33:11.781 --> 33:13.521
- yeah, he didn't mean nothing by it.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.825
It's okay, lieutenant.

33:16.161 --> 33:19.073
Change that bandage or I will
find you and change it myself.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.248
Yes, captain.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.248
- Good to see you, doc.
- Sir.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.919
Do you think he knows?

33:34.888 --> 33:36.799
If he doesn't, he will soon enough.

33:58.828 --> 33:59.828
Attention.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.165
At ease, fellas.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.643
Glad you're still with us, lieutenant.

34:06.878 --> 34:07.878
Thanks to you.

34:10.799 --> 34:11.879
What's your name?

34:12.175 --> 34:13.175
Gene cappa.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.751
I figured any man able to
keep ahead of the whole damn

34:16.888 --> 34:19.219
German army is a man worth
saving, lieutenant cappa.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.426
Graze wound, hurts like hell, don't it?

34:25.313 --> 34:27.599
Ain't no ticket home though.
No, it's not.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.440
And even if it was a
million dollar wound,

34:31.735 --> 34:33.442
no one seems to be going home these days.

34:35.699 --> 34:36.938
Are you the ranking nco?

34:38.743 --> 34:39.743
Yes sir.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.202
Any officers?

34:42.496 --> 34:44.328
We lost lieutenant
Briggs a few days back.

34:44.623 --> 34:47.831
Just us now, 350 field artillery.

34:50.045 --> 34:51.331
At least what's left of us.

34:55.594 --> 34:56.800
Where's your guns?

34:57.094 --> 34:58.301
Destroyed.

34:58.597 --> 34:59.131
We have a few long tommys

34:59.431 --> 35:00.967
and a handful of rounds between us.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.924
Just you coloreds?

35:04.227 --> 35:06.559
We picked up a few white
doughs a day or two ago

35:06.855 --> 35:09.016
but we have 'em spread out
along our checkpoints.

35:15.196 --> 35:16.652
Is it as bad as it looks, sir?

35:20.452 --> 35:22.443
We haven't had any contact in a long time.

35:26.041 --> 35:28.282
The Germans are making
a major push this way.

35:29.294 --> 35:33.503
Heavy infantry, tanks,
artillery all coming this way.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.668
The last orders I received,
hold at all costs.

35:41.973 --> 35:42.973
So it's like that?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.174
So it seems, sergeant.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.976
We created a few makeshift
checkpoints and choke points

35:56.279 --> 35:58.611
around our perimeter and
we're here in the middle.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.197
The Germans have been probing all along

36:01.493 --> 36:03.449
our lines trying to cut off our position.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.068
I mean hell, it's probably already

36:05.080 --> 36:07.116
cut off now and they're
just trying to take it.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.041
Artillery?

36:09.959 --> 36:11.439
Incoming I guess but they're either

36:11.503 --> 36:13.164
short or long, nothing too close.

36:13.463 --> 36:15.294
But they don't have you zeroed in?

36:15.590 --> 36:16.750
It's not that, sir.

36:17.050 --> 36:18.540
They know exactly where to hit us.

36:18.843 --> 36:21.380
Well if they have you cut
off, why aren't they advancing?

36:22.347 --> 36:23.347
I'll show you.

36:30.063 --> 36:31.303
This is the largest fuel supply

36:31.481 --> 36:33.563
within 1520 miles I reckon.

36:34.567 --> 36:35.727
Why didn't you blow it?

36:37.112 --> 36:38.977
A black man destroying army property?

36:40.073 --> 36:42.485
No sir, no orders to do that yet.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.152
What do you think we should do, sir?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.047
What do you mean?

36:57.173 --> 36:58.173
Well,

36:59.509 --> 37:02.342
I mean no disrespect but you
are the only officer here.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.680
What's the best route into town?

37:15.984 --> 37:17.269
The main road coming in.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.151
All right, let's go have a look.

37:27.871 --> 37:28.871
Any sign of the Germans?

37:29.122 --> 37:30.122
No, not on these roads.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.333
Sully.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.493
You're alive.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.149
Well they haven't killed me yet.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.213
I can see they've tried.

37:39.257 --> 37:42.374
- Are these your boys?
- What's left of 'em.

37:43.303 --> 37:45.760
The Germans hit us hard, we
scattered and fell back.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.888
A lot of that going around.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.344
Nowhere left to run, sir.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.764
All right, show me what you got.

38:05.033 --> 38:08.275
Sir, we have a plane in the sky.
One of our best pilots.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.703
Braxton four, Braxton
four, little blue, over.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.044
Braxton four, we copy.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.636
Captain, what do you see up there?

38:30.099 --> 38:30.804
Thick soup, sir.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.887
I don't know how much longer
we can stay up here, over.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.348
Waters, they say that you're the best,

38:36.648 --> 38:39.890
can fly through anything, rain,
snow, sleet or hail, over.

38:40.193 --> 38:40.773
The best?

38:41.069 --> 38:43.185
Is that how I volunteered
for this mission? Qver.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.400
Captain, you are my eyes and
I'm blind down here, over.

38:48.326 --> 38:48.985
If you don't mind me,

38:49.285 --> 38:50.900
sir, what are we doing up here?

38:52.247 --> 38:55.660
You're looking for the
goddamn German army, waters.

38:56.793 --> 38:59.284
We need to know if it's a
major offensive, over.

39:03.049 --> 39:05.381
So what am I looking for? Over.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.798
You'll know it when you see it, over.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.551
Copy that, over and out.

39:13.643 --> 39:14.928
Goddamn fly boy.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.765
I'd like to get him down
here with the 2nd division.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.405
Sir.

40:56.704 --> 40:57.784
- Private?
- Quiet.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.412
Germans, they're crawling over there.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.087
Plane sir, that's one of ours.

41:12.387 --> 41:13.843
How can you tell?

41:14.138 --> 41:15.469
The low hum of that engine,

41:15.765 --> 41:18.006
that's one of our scout
planes, no doubt about it.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.310
A scout plane, huh?

41:21.980 --> 41:23.095
I'd like to try something.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.352
Little blue, little blue, over.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.944
Little blue, little blue, over.

41:35.034 --> 41:36.914
Little blue,
little blue, come in.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.321
- Major?
- Daniels, is that you?

41:42.792 --> 41:46.785
Jeez, it's good to hear your voice, sir.
Where are you?

41:47.088 --> 41:48.828
In a recon plane in the clouds.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.372
We're looking for the enemy.

41:50.675 --> 41:52.961
I must be in range of your plane, sir.

41:54.012 --> 41:57.004
If you're looking for the Germans,
they're not too far away.

41:57.306 --> 41:59.513
You see them?

41:59.809 --> 42:01.765
They're right in front of me, sir.

42:02.061 --> 42:03.134
We're gonna
try to get a better view.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.512
We'll keep trying, you keep the line open.

42:05.815 --> 42:06.815
Roger that, sir.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.492
Well get underneath the clouds.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.624
I don't know
what is underneath me, sir.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.160
We could run into a tree,
that'll end this real fast.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.464
Waters, just do it.

42:34.135 --> 42:37.298
My, that is a lot of Germans.

42:37.597 --> 42:38.677
Confirmed.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.339
It looks like the
whole damn German army.

42:41.642 --> 42:43.803
Location 479 south 687.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.136
Repeat.

42:46.439 --> 42:47.439
479

42:47.565 --> 42:49.601
south 687.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.766
Sir, I can't stay up here much longer.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.276
That's all I need, captain.

42:54.614 --> 42:56.570
Get out of there, come on home.

42:56.866 --> 42:57.866
Copy that.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.627
Did you get that, sir? Over.

43:16.803 --> 43:17.803
Sir?

43:17.887 --> 43:18.922
Over.

43:21.432 --> 43:22.432
Dammit!

43:24.477 --> 43:26.388
Ok, it's time to go.

43:36.697 --> 43:38.858
Just trying to keep the ice off her, sir.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.695
But she sure will run smooth.

43:41.994 --> 43:42.653
He rounds mostly, sir,

43:42.954 --> 43:45.070
though we do have a handful of ap rounds.

43:45.373 --> 43:46.658
The boys and I scrapped up

43:46.958 --> 43:48.518
everything we could, couldn't we, boys?

43:49.877 --> 43:50.877
Does it drive?

43:52.839 --> 43:53.839
Shot, sir.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.539
Drive wheel hit by a German mine.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.335
It was a hell of a time
getting it out here.

44:01.556 --> 44:02.556
No, the tranny's done.

44:04.851 --> 44:07.183
This is our girl's last resting place.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.066
Old logger road,

44:14.193 --> 44:17.151
not many people know about this
spot except for the locals.

44:17.446 --> 44:19.687
We thought it'd be best
to move the tank here.

44:19.991 --> 44:22.653
But if the locals know about
it, the krauts know about it.

44:23.870 --> 44:27.408
Yeah, but it doesn't
appear to be in action.

44:29.375 --> 44:33.084
So cool, should be a surprise
when they come down this way.

44:34.505 --> 44:37.212
The valley creek should
protect us from the east

44:37.508 --> 44:39.874
and the mines should
protect our south flank.

44:40.178 --> 44:41.293
You know about those mines.

44:44.724 --> 44:48.262
The Germans will have a tough
time coming through here.

44:48.561 --> 44:49.561
Damn right.

44:50.855 --> 44:51.855
But they will come.

44:53.399 --> 44:58.018
We're low on ammunition,
not much for tank defense.

44:58.321 --> 45:02.439
No hope for friendly fire,
artillery or reinforcements.

45:03.743 --> 45:06.576
Sir, we can hold these positions.

45:07.663 --> 45:08.663
We can fight.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.782
The Germans haven't attacked in force

45:14.378 --> 45:17.245
and they will and then what?

45:17.548 --> 45:18.788
What's left?

45:19.091 --> 45:20.091
Who's left?

45:31.354 --> 45:33.720
My platoon was ambushed.

45:37.902 --> 45:42.316
King tiger came out of the
woods, took everyone out.

45:44.659 --> 45:46.775
These guys here, these men,

45:49.789 --> 45:50.949
these are are all we got.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.583
But sir,

45:55.378 --> 45:56.378
I just,

45:57.880 --> 45:58.880
I want to fight back.

46:01.175 --> 46:04.463
I owe my men that, I owe myself that.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.768
No, I'm losing no more men on my watch.

46:26.909 --> 46:29.571
Get your platoons off the
line, pull out in 30.

46:40.006 --> 46:41.006
Yes, sir.

47:00.526 --> 47:03.484
Linens, bandages, syrettes,
morphine and plasma.

47:04.572 --> 47:05.572
How much longer?

47:06.407 --> 47:09.820
Maybe enough for another
day, maybe two if we're lucky.

47:10.119 --> 47:12.485
Ma'am, we don't have
much left of anything.

47:12.788 --> 47:15.700
Food, water, maybe three days more is all.

47:17.168 --> 47:18.578
Find the ones that take priority.

47:18.878 --> 47:21.540
We ration the rest, make
do the best we can.

47:21.839 --> 47:22.839
Yes, ma'am.

47:24.967 --> 47:26.002
Something else, hope?

47:26.969 --> 47:29.802
No ma'am, it's just that, well,

47:31.807 --> 47:32.967
how can we help these men?

47:34.685 --> 47:35.970
Take it one day at a time.

47:43.736 --> 47:47.854
I stopped the bleeding but
we need more ab negative.

47:48.157 --> 47:49.157
We are out.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.037
No, we aren't.

47:55.247 --> 47:56.247
- Matthew.
- Mary,

47:58.167 --> 47:59.167
it's okay.

47:59.919 --> 48:00.919
I can make more.

48:45.881 --> 48:48.543
Hell, it is the lieutenant.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.959
We knew you were too tough
for those krauts, sir.

48:52.054 --> 48:52.713
When we didn't run into you

48:53.013 --> 48:55.595
in the woods, we thought the worst.

48:55.891 --> 48:56.891
Hey, where's rock?

49:03.816 --> 49:04.896
Rock didn't make it.

49:12.700 --> 49:13.700
He was a good man.

49:16.036 --> 49:17.036
He was.

49:19.874 --> 49:22.286
Lieutenant, are you
the one in charge here?

49:22.585 --> 49:23.585
Yes, sir.

49:25.004 --> 49:28.838
This depot is still intact,
guns, fuel, ammunition?

49:29.133 --> 49:33.001
Yes sir but we were
just about to blow it.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.966
Sir, I gave the orders to blow the depot.

49:36.265 --> 49:37.550
Leave nothing for the Germans.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.974
Well that's very smart
lieutenant, very smart indeed.

49:41.270 --> 49:43.431
I mean them Germans, they'll
be here any minute.

49:44.398 --> 49:46.138
But y'all don't have to
worry about anything else.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.350
Just make sure you don't leave

49:47.568 --> 49:49.274
anything on the way out, all right?

49:49.570 --> 49:51.356
Sir, I've already given the orders.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.863
Well the orders have changed, lieutenant.

49:56.160 --> 49:57.775
We'll handle this.

49:58.078 --> 50:01.445
Sir, we have wounded
and they need to leave.

50:01.749 --> 50:04.582
We'll get them evacuated
as soon as possible.

50:04.877 --> 50:07.289
Sir, may I speak... I'm sorry.

50:07.588 --> 50:09.419
Am I the lieutenant or are you?

50:10.841 --> 50:12.498
All right, when I say
"jump," you say "how high?"

50:12.510 --> 50:15.468
That's how this works, all right?

50:15.763 --> 50:18.755
I'm in charge. Tell me you
understand, do you understand?

50:21.060 --> 50:22.060
Do you understand me?

50:23.395 --> 50:25.681
But sir, we have critical wounded

50:27.233 --> 50:28.814
and I'm not leaving without 'em.

50:44.583 --> 50:46.164
Let me know if you need a hand.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.460
Thank you, sir.

50:47.670 --> 50:48.830
See you around the depot.

50:53.092 --> 50:57.256
We're with you, sir.

50:57.555 --> 50:58.995
Let's start gathering the wounded.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.482
Well, that confirms it.

51:12.778 --> 51:15.440
Major German offensive, tanks
and troops in the thousands.

51:15.739 --> 51:16.739
Recon was a success?

51:18.075 --> 51:19.531
The elsenborn Ridge

51:19.827 --> 51:21.863
is the northern edge of
the German offensive.

51:24.748 --> 51:26.113
All they gotta do is swing up

51:26.417 --> 51:28.749
from the north and cut
us and the British off.

51:30.129 --> 51:34.873
Yes but if we could form
a bottleneck on that road,

51:35.175 --> 51:37.791
we might be able to force
the Germans southeast

51:38.095 --> 51:40.427
and patton and his 3rd army are down there.

51:40.723 --> 51:42.054
Yeah, but that won't stop 'em.

51:43.058 --> 51:44.719
Well maybe not but sir,

51:45.019 --> 51:47.556
I have to say that's rough terrain.

51:49.607 --> 51:52.644
Thick forests, thin
intersecting logging roads.

51:52.943 --> 51:53.477
The Germans will have a hell

51:53.777 --> 51:56.314
of a time trying to
supply their tanks there.

51:56.614 --> 51:59.856
I'll report this back to
ike, see what he wants to do.

52:00.159 --> 52:00.739
Okay.

52:01.035 --> 52:03.367
Now there have been
some disturbing reports

52:03.662 --> 52:07.871
of english-speaking Germans
dressed in American

52:08.167 --> 52:11.330
military uniforms moving
in and out of our lines.

52:12.504 --> 52:14.870
Krauts pretending to be Americans?

52:15.174 --> 52:16.960
Speak pretty good english too.

52:17.259 --> 52:18.259
That's troubling.

52:19.011 --> 52:21.252
Command has been put on high alert.

52:21.555 --> 52:22.555
That bad?

52:23.307 --> 52:24.672
Yet to be seen.

52:26.935 --> 52:28.596
Mike, it's good work.

52:44.078 --> 52:45.193
Doc?

52:45.496 --> 52:47.361
That's the last of those
that can be moved, sir.

52:47.373 --> 52:48.853
The rest need to stay where they are.

52:51.001 --> 52:53.208
Sir, I'd like to request to stay behind.

52:54.463 --> 52:55.463
Are you sure?

52:56.924 --> 52:57.924
Yes, sir.

52:59.426 --> 53:01.106
You're not authorized to take that Jeep.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.010
This is one of ours,
it belongs to our hq.

53:04.306 --> 53:06.763
Sergeant, this does belong to us.

53:08.227 --> 53:10.684
I'm sorry sir, I can't
let you take that Jeep.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.310
What's the problem here?

53:12.606 --> 53:15.848
Sir, this Jeep belongs to our division

53:16.151 --> 53:17.732
and we need it to move out our wounded.

53:20.197 --> 53:21.437
Request denied, lieutenant.

53:21.740 --> 53:24.573
We need these vehicles to
conduct our operations.

53:24.868 --> 53:26.779
You and your boys, the wounded,

53:27.079 --> 53:28.785
y'all are gonna have to walk out of here.

53:30.290 --> 53:31.780
Well then we're not leaving, sir.

53:36.255 --> 53:37.791
Are you disobeying an order?

53:38.090 --> 53:40.422
No, sir. Just waiting for clarification.

53:46.807 --> 53:48.923
Well fine, go ahead. Take 'em.

53:49.226 --> 53:50.682
We're running out of time anyway.

53:52.479 --> 53:53.479
Gentlemen.

53:56.859 --> 53:58.140
Sir, something's a little bit off

53:58.152 --> 53:59.232
about our new friends here.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.822
You might need this.

54:14.835 --> 54:16.666
All right, let's move out.

54:18.464 --> 54:19.624
Let's go.

54:29.641 --> 54:32.849
Inform haufsfuehrer Piper
that the petrol supply is ours.

54:34.313 --> 54:35.598
And the American outposts?

54:37.274 --> 54:40.311
Any remaining, see that
they're disposed of.

54:42.279 --> 54:42.938
What do you want us to do

54:43.238 --> 54:44.694
with the remaining American wounded?

54:46.742 --> 54:49.108
- Them too.
- Yes, sir.

55:06.178 --> 55:07.714
What do you got for us, sarge?

55:08.013 --> 55:09.173
They gonna reinforce us?

55:09.473 --> 55:11.555
We're falling back, Jax.

55:11.850 --> 55:12.965
It be that bad?

55:13.268 --> 55:14.883
No, just tactical withdrawal.

55:15.187 --> 55:15.767
Keep the men low.

55:16.063 --> 55:18.395
I don't want the krauts
to know what we're up to.

55:18.690 --> 55:19.690
Outposts?

55:22.778 --> 55:23.778
Pull 'em last.

55:25.781 --> 55:27.317
Sure thing, sarge.

55:33.413 --> 55:34.413
This is my war now.

55:42.047 --> 55:44.083
Haufsfuehrer Piper, sir.

55:46.385 --> 55:47.385
Hello, sir.

55:50.722 --> 55:52.462
Yes sir, I'm looking at it right now.

55:56.019 --> 55:57.384
Yes, sir.

55:57.688 --> 55:58.688
Advance into town.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.936
We'll be ready, out.

56:07.948 --> 56:09.308
Get them boys on the petrol first.

56:09.491 --> 56:12.574
- I don't want a drop spilled.
- Yes, sir.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.317
Take the lead out of
your boots, sergeant.

56:14.329 --> 56:15.329
Come on, get a move on.

56:17.624 --> 56:20.081
What are we standing around for?
Let's go, come on.

56:22.254 --> 56:23.960
I have to do everything around here.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.139
Sir.

56:36.435 --> 56:38.235
Get your men prepared
to move off the line.

56:38.520 --> 56:41.136
We're blowing the depot.
But what about the Germans?

56:41.440 --> 56:43.931
We're gonna regroup, then link up.

56:44.234 --> 56:45.565
Are you okay with that?

56:47.029 --> 56:48.029
Yeah.

56:48.947 --> 56:52.314
The mps, they're just gonna
have to handle it from here.

56:52.618 --> 56:54.904
- Yes sir.
- Someone gimme a hand.

56:56.038 --> 56:57.448
Daniels?

57:04.713 --> 57:06.078
Captain.

57:06.381 --> 57:07.962
Hell of a day to find you.

57:08.300 --> 57:10.040
Let's get him to this Jeep.

57:14.181 --> 57:16.638
- Get water, water.
- Here you go, sir.

57:22.189 --> 57:25.397
Heavy German infantry and
army coming down the road.

57:25.692 --> 57:27.503
It's a good thing
we found you then, sir.

57:27.527 --> 57:30.940
Hey, we're getting
outta here, pulling out.

57:36.495 --> 57:40.158
Hey, where'd you find this?

57:40.457 --> 57:41.947
Mps in town, sir.

57:42.250 --> 57:43.365
Figured it was one of ours.

57:46.755 --> 57:48.416
Military police?

57:48.715 --> 57:49.715
That's right.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.093
This is my Jeep.

57:55.889 --> 57:56.889
This is my Jeep.

57:58.642 --> 58:00.758
My men were ambushed by military police.

58:01.061 --> 58:02.972
They killed everyone, I
managed to get away.

58:07.359 --> 58:08.682
You think those are the same guys?

58:08.694 --> 58:11.731
It had to be.
This is my headquarters Jeep.

58:14.282 --> 58:16.523
You guys came in with
them, what do you think?

58:18.870 --> 58:21.031
Something sure did
seem off about 'em, sir.

58:23.417 --> 58:25.157
If they're German, sir, we gotta go back.

58:27.838 --> 58:30.705
Sully, we got heavy German
armor coming down the road.

58:31.008 --> 58:33.374
Tanks, half-tracks, half
the damn German army.

58:33.677 --> 58:35.258
- How were they looking?
- Sergeant?

58:35.554 --> 58:37.465
Were they expecting a fight?

58:37.764 --> 58:40.346
I don't know, sarge. They
don't know we're here.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.678
I suppose they didn't
seem ready for a fight.

58:45.313 --> 58:47.804
What do you think, gene?

58:48.108 --> 58:49.223
We can't leave the depot.

58:50.694 --> 58:53.436
So what do we do, run and
hide or do we stay and fight?

58:54.406 --> 58:55.406
We have to fight.

59:02.122 --> 59:03.453
What's your plan, lieutenant?

59:06.918 --> 59:08.499
- Gimme some runners.
- Yes sir.

59:11.798 --> 59:12.798
Okay, listen up.

59:13.967 --> 59:15.707
I want everybody locked
and loaded, all right?

59:15.719 --> 59:16.424
If we gotta shoot our way out

59:16.720 --> 59:18.301
of this place, we need to be ready.

59:19.890 --> 59:20.890
Sir, m1 garand.

59:24.311 --> 59:25.550
I haven't shot one of those since basic.

59:25.562 --> 59:26.562
Give me something else.

59:26.813 --> 59:29.395
Okay uh, all right.

59:30.942 --> 59:32.182
How about a grease gun?

59:33.612 --> 59:34.727
That's something else.

59:44.331 --> 59:46.697
Hey, what's going on, private?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.787
- Check in on frequency 473.
- What's it say?

59:51.588 --> 59:53.374
"The Germans are preparing."

59:55.092 --> 01:00:00.007
Hold fire until the last
minute and then we fall back.

01:00:00.639 --> 01:00:01.719
We're blowing the depot.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:03.801
"Good luck, gene."

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.143
We fight?

01:00:06.394 --> 01:00:07.600
We fight.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:11.013
Hey, we fight. Tell
cappa's men we are ready.

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:12.316
Right, sarge.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.608
- What now?
- Ready the tank.

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.769
Let's make sure they don't see us unaware.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:23.992
Hey, it's the lieutenant.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:28.580
We heard you had a change of heart, sir.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.520
Those American
mps, yeah, they're Germans

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:31.078
in American uniforms

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:32.788
those sneaky kraut bastards.

01:00:33.088 --> 01:00:35.233
Germans are coming in
thinking they hold the town.

01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.737
We're gonna get the jump on 'em,
they're gonna be mad as hell.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:39.382
Yeah, we've been ready for this.

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:41.948
When you hear the depot explode,

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.128
that's your signal to fall back.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.882
- Hell yeah.
- Good luck, sergeant.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.184
Yes sir.

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.848
We're going to war.

01:00:59.531 --> 01:01:01.271
- Hey Rudy, Rudy?
- Yeah.

01:01:01.575 --> 01:01:02.575
Where's that Wayne kid?

01:01:02.784 --> 01:01:03.784
Haven't seen him.

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:07.534
Everybody's ready, cap.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:10.447
All right, when we get into town,

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:11.865
let me do all the talking.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:16.499
If there needs to be any
shooting, wait for my signal.

01:01:16.798 --> 01:01:17.798
Yes sir.

01:01:22.053 --> 01:01:23.251
You sure you're ready for this?

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:25.470
I'm the only one they won't recognize.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:29.428
Just make sure we have
time to blow that depot.

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:30.968
Germans coming in.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:32.980
That's our cue.

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.148
Good luck.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.564
The men are ready, sir.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.867
Good.

01:01:46.453 --> 01:01:48.068
Think the Germans will fall for it?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:54.749
Think these will help?

01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.125
This can work.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.088
This will work.

01:03:15.917 --> 01:03:17.248
Is there a problem, soldier?

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.958
Say that again, private.

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:30.841
Hell of a thing, sarge.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:33.556
The Germans are coming

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.934
and our officers are
looking at fighting them.

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.769
Checkpoints are still up?

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.555
It's looking that way, sir.

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.895
And they sent you back
here to tell us that?

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:46.569
Not exactly.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.696
I figured shooting it out here

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.448
would be better than in the woods.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:53.902
You did good, private.

01:03:54.956 --> 01:03:55.956
You did good.

01:04:15.894 --> 01:04:17.555
Okay, okay.

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.745
All right boys, wait for it.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.879
Come on.

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:48.175
Come on.

01:04:51.096 --> 01:04:53.087
Here you go, here you go.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.010
We're all friends here.

01:04:57.936 --> 01:04:58.971
Oh boy.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:01.261
Hey, the krauts are coming.

01:05:01.564 --> 01:05:02.849
Hey sarge!

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.149
Eyes forward.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.359
Sarge, what's going on!

01:05:05.485 --> 01:05:07.897
The krauts are making a
push, be on the ready.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.408
Get ready boys, get ready.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:22.328
Rifles at the ready, no one
fires until I give the signal.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:28.330
That judge ready?

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.586
Jury's in session.

01:05:34.514 --> 01:05:35.629
Sir, we got a problem.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:37.550
What is it?

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:39.682
The Americans still hold the checkpoints.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:43.394
Get command on the radio now.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:45.250
What are you doing standing here still?

01:05:45.316 --> 01:05:47.036
I don't care if you've gotta walk barefoot,

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.146
get your butt out there and do something.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:51.561
What do you got, lead in your boots?

01:05:51.573 --> 01:05:53.109
Let's go, on the double.

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:54.408
Goddammit!

01:06:05.086 --> 01:06:06.326
Come on, guys.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.818
You're sure this is gonna work, right?

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:11.318
- It's gonna work.
- All right.

01:06:11.342 --> 01:06:13.207
Just keep smiling and
waving like an idiot.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:16.889
Wait for it.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:27.483
Wait for it.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.325
Wait for it.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:48.292
All right, time's up.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.550
Hit it!

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:26.239
Go, on the double, move.

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:28.079
Ford, neuhardt, on the western flank.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:32.121
Scott, pike, I want you on the south.
Look sharp.

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:34.584
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:38.668
What can I do for you, captain?

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:40.973
Hi.

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:57.733
Hey!

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:21.468
Wait for it.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:38.738
Now!

01:08:52.252 --> 01:08:53.252
Hit 'em!

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:55.836
- Fire!
- On the way.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:02.595
Reload.

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:12.053
Hit 'em again.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:13.517
Again, hit 'em again.

01:09:35.087 --> 01:09:36.294
Here they come!

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.961
No one fires until I give the signal.

01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:45.136
Hold it.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.430
Hold it.

01:09:54.023 --> 01:09:55.023
Fire!

01:10:17.964 --> 01:10:20.000
Sir, we're under attack.

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:47.451
- Ready?
- Yes sir.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.655
Just get me there and
I'll do the rest, sir.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:51.910
Just wait for my signal.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.115
Covering fire.

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.272
Pour it on 'em!

01:11:40.922 --> 01:11:42.753
Again, hit 'em again.

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.883
I'm running low on the 30.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:53.218
All right, I'm on the 50.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.402
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.880
- Form a perimeter.
- Yes, corporal.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.339
- How long?
- Five minutes to set

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:36.924
the charge, five minutes to
get the hell out of dodge.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.097
- Just say 10 minutes.
- You worry about the time.

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.353
- Let me worry about this.
- I'll cover you.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:43.521
Covering fire!

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:05.085
Running low on ammo, sarge, 60s.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.871
How much longer we gotta hold 'em?

01:13:07.174 --> 01:13:09.665
When we get the signal.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.349
Get us out of here, lieutenant.

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:45.951
You sure this is a good idea, sir?

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:48.246
Best idea I've had in the war.

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.005
Yeah, I heard about boucage.

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.758
I hated the boucage.

01:13:53.054 --> 01:13:55.045
Sir, how many shots we got?

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:56.348
Two.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:57.599
Better make them count.

01:13:57.808 --> 01:13:59.719
All right, let's go, let's go!

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:07.753
Corporal, we've
got a problem here.

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:08.311
What is it, pavlov?

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.693
My timing device, it's not working.

01:14:10.988 --> 01:14:12.603
- What does that mean?
- That means someone has

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.152
to stay behind to do it manually.

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.118
I'll do it.

01:14:18.412 --> 01:14:19.412
Oh no, no.

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:22.245
Wayne, what the hell happened?

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:23.747
I'I do it, I'll stay behind.

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.683
No Wayne, we can't just leave you here.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:27.660
Please, let me do this.

01:14:30.758 --> 01:14:31.758
Okay.

01:14:34.178 --> 01:14:35.338
Five minutes.

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:40.847
Thank you.

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:42.349
It's okay, go.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:43.645
Let's move out.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.231
Let's go, go.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.297
Jack, there!

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:07.601
I'm ready.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:16.227
All right, let's go.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:18.896
Can't keep this up much longer.

01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:23.154
- Did it work?
- Like a charm.

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:26.491
Five minutes, this town
lights up like Christmas.

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:27.791
Move out!

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:39.796
The petrol, the petrol, the petrol!

01:16:48.979 --> 01:16:50.890
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:16:51.190 --> 01:16:53.055
The petrol, the petrol! Go, go, go!

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:56.229
Don't move!

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:12.454
That's the signal, fall back, fall back.

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:21.592
- That's the signal.
- Everybody, move it.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.423
Fall back, fall back.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.510
Sir, the general.

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.850
- Attention.
- At ease, sir.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:36.025
Mike.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.484
How was your trip? Any trouble?

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:41.441
No, no, no trouble.

01:17:42.533 --> 01:17:44.114
Though I did find myself detained

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:47.868
by the military police as a
suspected German infiltrator.

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.696
Oh, how's that?

01:17:52.209 --> 01:17:54.791
What's the capital of Illinois?

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:55.621
Springfield.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.041
Yeah, so I thought myself.

01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:00.046
Which is when I suspected this young man

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:02.583
as he himself being an infiltrator.

01:18:03.637 --> 01:18:05.423
That or a product of poor education.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:09.473
Or simply harboring fond
memories of a trip to Chicago.

01:18:10.811 --> 01:18:12.472
We're determining the rates presently.

01:18:14.315 --> 01:18:18.524
But these krauts, I tell you,
they've got us all twisted up.

01:18:19.486 --> 01:18:21.772
They're cutting wires,
they're turning road signs,

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:24.358
they're sending us all Willy-nilly.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:32.163
And 376th regiments through walerscheild.

01:18:33.626 --> 01:18:34.331
And?

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.788
And the krauts switched
all the road signs.

01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:39.578
Half the division turned up in Frankfurt.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:42.874
Oh god, and what about our artillery?

01:18:44.011 --> 01:18:48.254
Half made it, half got
jammed in the rear.

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:49.967
Jesus, what did lke say?

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.968
We're gonna meet to discuss the options.

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:01.549
Mike, you've been in the thick of it.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:04.607
What would you do?

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:06.947
Where do we make our stand?

01:19:16.627 --> 01:19:20.211
Bastogne, all reinforcements to bastogne

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:22.837
and that's where we make our stand.

01:19:28.806 --> 01:19:29.966
I'll tell the general.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:32.809
And sir?

01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:36.354
Thank you, sir.

01:19:38.649 --> 01:19:40.685
You know, I said it
before, Mike and I'm gonna

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:43.146
say it now, perhaps hopefully
with more meaning.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:45.863
Thank you.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.033
Major.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.496
What are your orders, sir?

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.750
We're going to bastogne,
haas, prepare my Jeep.

01:20:00.045 --> 01:20:01.045
Yes sir.

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:04.667
All right, listen up everyone.

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:07.461
Orders to all units,

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:10.177
turn and fight.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:14.173
Stop the Germans or at least
try to slow 'em down.

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:15.476
We need to buy time.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:18.227
Send out the order,

01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:20.433
now.

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:22.223
Yes sir.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:30.366
Bastogne.

01:20:49.386 --> 01:20:50.592
Is this all that's left?

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.258
Good to see you, sergeant.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:56.264
Hell of a show captain but
next time, make it quicker.

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.637
I'll take that under consideration.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:02.804
East, the roads are open east.

01:21:03.108 --> 01:21:04.598
- Bastogne?
- Bastogne.

01:21:05.527 --> 01:21:09.019
All right, get in. We don't
have any time to lose.

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:10.563
Mount up!

01:21:11.111 --> 01:21:19.111
