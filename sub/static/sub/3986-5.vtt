WEBVTT

00:09.776 --> 00:11.067
Joe will be missed.

00:11.766 --> 00:12.840
Very much missed.

00:13.002 --> 00:14.117
We liked Joe.

00:14.669 --> 00:16.445
A hard man not to like.

00:18.302 --> 00:20.746
Tomorrow ain't
promised to no one.

00:22.810 --> 00:24.953
Meanwhile, we go on.

00:27.204 --> 00:28.891
In business-- in life--

00:30.216 --> 00:33.824
What you learn to appreciate
the most is a dependable man.

00:34.236 --> 00:36.325
One day, same as the next.

00:36.772 --> 00:38.621
Yeah, I learned a lot
from watching Joe.

00:38.975 --> 00:41.362
We deal with you
or your second.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.179
No one else.

00:44.339 --> 00:45.973
No one else knows our names.

00:46.132 --> 00:47.690
No one else contacts us.

00:48.941 --> 00:49.953
Understand?

00:51.136 --> 00:54.318
To contact us, use this...
only.

00:55.674 --> 00:57.479
I don't talk on no cellphones.

00:59.408 --> 01:01.646
Here.
To call for lunch, you can talk.

01:02.241 --> 01:03.715
To call your girl,
you can talk.

01:03.874 --> 01:05.998
To call your lawyer even,
you can talk--

01:06.611 --> 01:08.851
The law says
that is between you and the laer.

01:09.470 --> 01:10.442
All right?

01:10.603 --> 01:13.018
To find out what movie is
playing down the street,

01:13.176 --> 01:14.290
You can talk.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.745
All of that is good because
all of that tells them there

01:18.098 --> 01:19.500
there is nothing good to hear.

01:19.910 --> 01:22.215
But for business,

01:23.364 --> 01:25.110
we do not talk on the phone.

01:25.993 --> 01:26.785
Never.

01:27.139 --> 01:27.984
Right.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.973
I mean,
Joe taught me that.

01:30.346 --> 01:32.908
But what about--
What is...

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.916 --> 01:47.063
How that play?

01:47.581 --> 01:49.035
Man overcame his grief.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.359
Do it feel like a crown
on your head right now?

01:53.748 --> 01:54.676
Do it?

01:55.731 --> 01:57.898
'Cause that's what
I'm wearin' on my head.

01:58.739 --> 02:00.197
We should celebrate.

02:00.651 --> 02:01.549
Yeah?

02:01.918 --> 02:02.995
Atlantic city.

02:04.018 --> 02:05.493
Can't play like that now.

02:05.765 --> 02:07.974
Omar gonna make a move.
We know this.

02:10.691 --> 02:13.211
Yo, I need to go past home.
You mind a ride?

02:13.371 --> 02:14.954
Naw. You know I like your peoples.

02:15.115 --> 02:18.291
Fact is, I gotta tell 'em I'm not
gonna be comin' round for a time.

02:18.451 --> 02:20.530
You stepped up and made your play.

02:20.953 --> 02:22.826
Now I gotta make mine.

04:04.590 --> 04:06.712
<i>- At least 4.
- Got it.</i>

04:06.874 --> 04:10.092
We're going back through the old cases,
so we could find more than that.

04:10.312 --> 04:11.416
<i>What else?</i>

04:11.783 --> 04:13.343
And the motive now seems sexual.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.122
What do you mean sexual?

04:15.771 --> 04:18.411
Is someone
sodomizing homeless men?

04:18.571 --> 04:20.077
<i>I can't get that specific.</i>

04:20.238 --> 04:21.796
How can I not get specific?

04:22.139 --> 04:25.345
I'm just saying the killer is acting
from sexual compulsions.

04:25.504 --> 04:28.345
Anything more detailed than that
we need to keep in the case file.

04:28.504 --> 04:31.711
<i>I don't know, detective. Last time,
I couldn't get it out front on metro.</i>

04:31.873 --> 04:34.172
But let me run it by my desk
and call you back. All right?

04:34.332 --> 04:35.353
All right.

04:37.598 --> 04:39.346
Anything late from copshop?

04:39.584 --> 04:41.726
Follow-ups on the recent murders.

04:42.441 --> 04:45.614
An arrest on one, which was
the domestic cutting from Hampden.

04:45.775 --> 04:48.534
No arrests in a couple of drug-relateds
from east Baltimore.

04:48.808 --> 04:50.341
Give me a bit for the budget line.

04:50.508 --> 04:53.082
Domestic was a Patricia boggus,
found in her car.

04:53.242 --> 04:56.536
Drug-Relateds were one Joseph Stewart,
found in his dining room,

04:56.695 --> 04:59.624
and one Nathaniel Manns,
found in an alley garage.

05:00.110 --> 05:03.583
A couple grafs on each.
Write it as a single short.

05:03.743 --> 05:06.580
Also, I got word
on another homeless murder.

05:06.976 --> 05:09.038
The detective on it says it's related.

05:09.501 --> 05:10.725
He says it's sexual.

05:12.012 --> 05:12.955
Sexual?

05:13.850 --> 05:15.732
- They being raped?
- He wouldn't confirm that.

05:15.891 --> 05:18.758
He just says that the killings
are sexual in nature.

05:19.960 --> 05:21.331
Write what you got.

05:21.748 --> 05:24.181
I'll run it by the 4:00,
see if it takes.

05:28.171 --> 05:31.209
This indictment is the result
of an 18-month investigation

05:31.369 --> 05:33.422
by the state's attorney's office

05:33.583 --> 05:35.420
and the Baltimore police department.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.943
And it shines a light
on a cornerstone issue

05:38.104 --> 05:39.790
for any representative government--

05:39.951 --> 05:41.215
Public trust

05:41.848 --> 05:43.192
of public servants.

05:43.987 --> 05:46.419
Senator Davis
abused that trust.

05:47.430 --> 05:50.271
He traded on his power and
influence so that he could use

05:50.431 --> 05:51.723
local businesses

05:51.882 --> 05:55.419
and campaign donors
as his personal A.T.M. machine.

05:55.918 --> 05:58.250
He created a network of charitable

05:58.410 --> 06:00.482
and non-profit organizations

06:00.641 --> 06:04.349
whose purpose was to accumulate cash
for his private use,

06:04.509 --> 06:06.667
- betraying the goodwill...
- Ronnie Pearlman?

06:06.825 --> 06:08.894
Bill Zorzi, covering
federal court for the "Sun."

06:09.054 --> 06:10.376
Right.
How do you do?

06:10.536 --> 06:13.059
Not to be all petulant
on your special day here,

06:13.220 --> 06:15.243
But since when
does a prosecutor of this town

06:15.402 --> 06:17.843
stage a perp walk
and not call the daily newspaper?

06:18.529 --> 06:21.138
We called Gail Gibson.
Left a message on her voice mail.

06:21.524 --> 06:23.517
Gail left for a freelance gig
4 months ago.

06:24.789 --> 06:26.613
Well, her voice mail still works.

06:27.325 --> 06:29.049
Who's replacing her on city courts?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.372
From now on,

06:33.283 --> 06:35.030
just don't jam me like that again.

06:35.857 --> 06:37.682
...he must be he accountable

06:38.302 --> 06:39.832
for his fraudulent actions.

06:40.051 --> 06:43.297
Senator Davis has opened
our legislative body

06:43.520 --> 06:45.142
<i>to monetary persuasions.</i>

06:46.092 --> 06:49.661
<i>He has done this knowingly
and with complete disregard</i>

06:50.421 --> 06:52.425
<i>for the office that he represents.</i>

06:53.244 --> 06:55.471
- It is this kind of impropriety...
- How's it feel, Clay?

06:55.631 --> 06:57.517
Not much fun on the ass end, is it?

06:58.822 --> 07:00.080
You said it, Norman.

07:00.421 --> 07:03.228
There's the short Con
and the long Con.

07:04.516 --> 07:05.903
You're gonna need a statement.

07:06.063 --> 07:07.469
Nothing too joyful.

07:07.629 --> 07:11.437
You don't dance on Clay's grave until
you're sure the motherfucker's dead.

07:11.659 --> 07:13.604
Clay ain't getting up from this.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.911
Also you don't want
to piss off his base,

07:16.071 --> 07:17.604
being too gleeful about it.

07:17.763 --> 07:19.437
That guy still has a base?

07:20.131 --> 07:21.830
After all this shit he's pulled?

07:24.132 --> 07:26.213
I'll tell you one thing.
That fella right there

07:26.374 --> 07:28.306
is looking pretty damn mayoral.

07:28.945 --> 07:30.845
More than Nerese, definitely.

07:31.766 --> 07:35.697
With the profile he gets from this,
I'd say it's Mr. Bond's race to lose.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.187
<i>...and remain under common court.</i>

07:39.124 --> 07:42.949
<i>Senator Davis
will have to account for that money.</i>

07:59.209 --> 08:01.552
- What'd you tell your girl?
- That I'm goin' away on business.

08:01.826 --> 08:03.749
I won't be around for a couple weeks.

08:04.138 --> 08:06.801
- Shouldn't be more than that.
- Better not.

08:06.962 --> 08:09.344
... and miss Trainor say
we gonna learn a problem like that

08:09.504 --> 08:11.307
once every day for
this year and the next.

08:11.467 --> 08:12.655
You mean memorize 'em?

08:12.987 --> 08:14.888
Learn it by heart.
Learn the question.

08:15.049 --> 08:16.367
Learn the answer, too.

08:16.528 --> 08:19.400
'Cause them questions gonna all been
the M.S.A. test you all take next year.

08:19.561 --> 08:20.695
She tell you all that?

08:20.854 --> 08:24.095
Miss Trainor say if the scores
don't go up before the selection

08:24.255 --> 08:26.114
all the teachers gonna get fired.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.741
Selection?
What she mean?

08:27.902 --> 08:29.892
When the people vote for whoever.

08:30.341 --> 08:31.866
You mean the election.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.089
Nigga think you all that.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.695
Why you gonna go and do that?

08:45.983 --> 08:47.933
- Dukie about to cry.
- Fuck is wrong with you?

08:48.093 --> 08:50.393
Ain't nothin' wrong with me!
I'm out here gettin' stuff done.

08:50.554 --> 08:53.188
You up in some house somewhere
playin' Mike's lil' bitch.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.516
Smacked his little ass.

09:07.114 --> 09:10.002
... and finally, we've got
that 40-inch thumbsucker on Bud Selig

09:10.160 --> 09:12.586
and baseball's halfhearted response

09:12.746 --> 09:14.954
to the latest recommendations
on steroid use.

09:15.115 --> 09:17.054
Bottom line is
the owners think bud is swell,

09:17.214 --> 09:19.632
The players union is staying mum,
Bondsashe home run record, and

09:19.825 --> 09:21.668
everyone's pretending
the issue will go away.

09:21.827 --> 09:23.114
And there's news in there?

09:23.732 --> 09:25.345
What do you like for the front?

09:26.098 --> 09:28.942
Clay Davis indictment, obviously.
The congressional hearings on Iraq.

09:29.101 --> 09:32.150
Price's piece on how much Carcetti raise
for his gubernatorial run is solid.

09:32.311 --> 09:33.778
And the feature on John Waters

09:33.938 --> 09:36.338
filming again in Baltimore
could go out front if the art is good.

09:36.497 --> 09:38.956
We have him on the film set,
posing with a couple of child actors.

09:39.116 --> 09:40.220
Is that allowed?

09:40.817 --> 09:43.354
Now. Let's not confuse
the auteur with his art.

09:43.513 --> 09:45.570
- Anyone like anything else?
- This came in late, but

09:45.731 --> 09:47.669
this business at the bottom
of the metro budget

09:47.829 --> 09:50.422
about another homeless man being
murdered-- That might have some play.

09:50.581 --> 09:52.260
There were other homeless men murdered?

09:52.420 --> 09:56.661
We ran a short piece a week ago
about possible connections in 3 cases.

09:56.821 --> 09:58.961
- Inside metro.
- The motive's said to be sexual,

09:59.121 --> 10:01.767
but the cops are being cryptic
about what exactly That means.

10:02.518 --> 10:06.156
Well, we could run it inside, but
you might want to Report it some more,

10:06.315 --> 10:08.696
see where it goes.
Right now, it's a little vague for A-1.

10:08.854 --> 10:11.527
OK, then, we'll see where
we are in a couple hours.

10:13.271 --> 10:14.553
I told you, duke.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.459
I fuck 'em up good.
Just say the word, man.

10:17.619 --> 10:20.973
Naw, man. I can't have you steppin' up
for me anymore, you know?

10:22.333 --> 10:24.391
Yeah, well.
Talk to the man.

10:25.788 --> 10:27.344
He'll set you straight.

10:31.468 --> 10:33.133
- Yo, Mr. Dennis.
- Hey.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.262
I need to train with you some.

10:42.085 --> 10:43.168
See that.

10:43.608 --> 10:45.000
What happened?

10:45.689 --> 10:48.528
It ain't no thing. I'm just
kinda gettin' a little tired of it.

10:48.808 --> 10:49.935
All right, son.

10:50.096 --> 10:52.567
Go get some gloves on
and let's see where you at.

10:53.944 --> 10:56.702
It's all pretty straightforward.
I'm surprised the lawyers

10:56.861 --> 10:59.118
you were paying went to the trouble
of getting it postponed.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.335
Maybe 'cause we was payin' by the hour.

11:03.574 --> 11:06.024
In any event,
you got a lot going for you here.

11:06.183 --> 11:08.667
Car registered to a front,
guns in a secreted compartment.

11:08.828 --> 11:11.542
The woman we registered it to,
She can't do no time.

11:11.702 --> 11:12.890
Just a name we used.

11:13.574 --> 11:14.884
Then get someone who can.

11:15.045 --> 11:18.686
Preferably someone without priors,
someone you trust to Stand the charge.

11:24.522 --> 11:26.734
Also came past with this here.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.619
More money made clean.

11:33.241 --> 11:35.374
When you figure out
what we gonna do with that there,

11:35.533 --> 11:37.656
- Holler at me.
- How do I do that?

11:45.453 --> 11:46.491
0909.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.578
Anything else?

11:50.020 --> 11:51.855
Naw,
take me off your clock.

12:07.368 --> 12:09.048
Fuckin' mope pisses me off.

12:09.700 --> 12:10.959
Be generous.

12:11.636 --> 12:14.509
I have a feeling this firm is
going to have quite a payday

12:14.668 --> 12:16.656
from Mr. Stanfield and his people.

12:17.250 --> 12:18.789
He just gave me his phone number.

12:18.949 --> 12:20.760
If Marlo Stanfield
is using a cellphone,

12:21.838 --> 12:26.182
it's just a matter of time before we're
up to our asses in pre-trial motions,

12:26.963 --> 12:28.852
litigating a wiretap case.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.190
Joe gave him to us just in time.

12:59.158 --> 13:00.138
What now?

13:01.989 --> 13:03.690
You need to attribute that?

13:04.981 --> 13:07.782
- What?
- Fifth graf, the dependent clause.

13:09.027 --> 13:10.292
The one about a "pattern

13:10.451 --> 13:13.528
of widespread influence
peddling over a period of years."

13:13.687 --> 13:15.740
Either the indictment
shows that or it doesn't.

13:15.901 --> 13:19.077
Besides which, you begin 3 grafs
in a row with a gerund. Look.

13:19.236 --> 13:22.205
How do you expect me to write this thing
with your Fucking fingers in my eyes?

13:22.366 --> 13:24.875
At least let me turn my copy
in before you stomp on it.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.378
Atta boy, Zorz.

13:31.908 --> 13:35.819
They want more reporting on this, but
I don't see where it Can go from here.

13:36.509 --> 13:38.367
The cops are selling a sexual motive,

13:38.526 --> 13:40.801
but they won't explain it
any more than that.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.411
Who are you dealing with?

13:43.570 --> 13:45.286
Detective who has the case.

13:46.804 --> 13:48.361
And he wants publicity?

13:57.873 --> 13:59.777
Didn't know if you'd come back.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.197
Took a lot of money with you.

14:03.661 --> 14:05.621
It wasn't about the money, bro.

14:06.508 --> 14:08.078
Wasn't never about that.

14:11.994 --> 14:13.254
Is that him?

14:15.508 --> 14:18.248
Old Monk prefer the condo life, I see.

14:18.409 --> 14:20.215
Too good for a rowhouse.

14:20.374 --> 14:21.942
Movin' with muscle, too.

14:22.103 --> 14:25.049
Most likely they expectin' you
to make a move.

14:25.210 --> 14:26.621
An' here I am.

14:28.243 --> 14:29.560
How 'bout that?

14:33.880 --> 14:35.385
Thanks for meeting me again.

14:35.545 --> 14:38.459
This is Scott Templeton.
He'll be working the story with me.

14:41.079 --> 14:43.706
It's not like I want everyone
at your newspaper knowing my name.

14:43.979 --> 14:47.098
Look, you want these homeless cases
to get attention, right?

14:47.912 --> 14:49.651
And that's what
you're trying to do here.

14:49.810 --> 14:50.820
Guy's a predator.

14:50.980 --> 14:52.512
- People need to know.
- Agreed.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.965
And I understand there's things
you need to keep secret

14:55.125 --> 14:57.187
so that you can solve the murders.
I get that.

14:57.348 --> 15:00.022
We can't do much with this story
unless we give it enough juice.

15:00.182 --> 15:01.075
Juice?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.446
We need to tell people
what this is about,

15:03.608 --> 15:04.757
why he's doing it.

15:04.916 --> 15:06.709
We need to make
this thing come alive

15:06.870 --> 15:09.490
or they're gonna bury the story
like they did the last time.

15:09.649 --> 15:10.816
I told you it's sexual.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.946
Compulsion. Obsession,
that kinda thing.

15:13.106 --> 15:14.758
But what the fuck does that mean?

15:14.918 --> 15:17.303
It's not like he's carving up housewives

15:17.462 --> 15:19.290
or strangling coeds, here.

15:19.517 --> 15:21.638
Your guy's killing homeless men.

15:22.335 --> 15:23.997
Why exactly?
What's in his head?

15:24.158 --> 15:26.297
Is he raping them?
Sodomizing them?

15:26.457 --> 15:29.493
I don't have any semen
in any of the cases. I don't have that.

15:29.651 --> 15:31.492
But he's doing something, right?

15:31.653 --> 15:34.161
He ties a red ribbon
around their arms.

15:34.320 --> 15:36.707
- A red ribbon?
- Yeah, a bow.

15:37.320 --> 15:40.162
He gift-wraps the motherfuckers.
That enough juice for you?

15:40.321 --> 15:41.488
Yeah, kinky.

15:41.655 --> 15:44.529
But no one kills people
to tie ribbons around their arms.

15:44.794 --> 15:46.797
Can we say they were molested?

15:47.072 --> 15:48.620
Is it fair to say that?

15:50.416 --> 15:53.640
- We'll go with molested then.
- You didn't get that from me.

15:54.589 --> 15:56.035
- Another round?
- What else?

15:56.196 --> 15:58.797
You want this story to fly
you got to give us Something different.

15:59.099 --> 16:01.607
Keep what you need for the file,
but give us something with a twist.

16:01.801 --> 16:03.500
A sexual serial killer isn't enough?

16:03.923 --> 16:05.376
Cold world, I know.

16:14.118 --> 16:15.366
He started biting them.

16:15.527 --> 16:16.332
What?

16:16.995 --> 16:18.568
He's biting his victims.

16:19.159 --> 16:22.703
Inside thigh,
right ass cheek, left nipple.

16:23.394 --> 16:25.746
- He's a biter.
- Fuck. Shit.

16:27.074 --> 16:28.798
That twisted enough for ya?

16:29.246 --> 16:31.435
Are we talkin' cannibalism here?

16:31.595 --> 16:32.986
Just biting for now.

16:33.529 --> 16:35.169
We'll see where it goes.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.886
And did he bite all of them?

16:37.129 --> 16:38.161
Not all.

16:38.670 --> 16:41.055
Just the latest ones.
He's maturing.

16:41.430 --> 16:42.304
Maturing?

16:42.463 --> 16:44.894
It's a technical term.
It's when a serial killer's

16:45.766 --> 16:47.204
becoming more obsessive.

16:47.365 --> 16:49.307
He starts to develop
an intricate pattern

16:49.467 --> 16:51.105
in what he does with the bodies.

16:51.266 --> 16:52.446
It's weird stuff.

16:53.834 --> 16:55.613
A biter. That's great.

16:56.002 --> 16:57.328
My name's nowhere on this.

16:58.516 --> 17:00.860
For your tab.
We'd stay and have one with you,

17:01.018 --> 17:03.124
but we still have time
to make the second edition.

17:03.415 --> 17:04.251
Thanks.

17:30.958 --> 17:33.564
So you thinkin'
if you learn to fight some,

17:33.725 --> 17:36.606
people 'round
the way gonna leave you be.

17:37.678 --> 17:40.816
Thing is, even if you learn to fight,

17:41.789 --> 17:44.339
people gonna come at you just the same.

17:44.740 --> 17:47.399
It ain't like the movies
where you beat up one bully

17:47.767 --> 17:50.453
and the rest just
back the hell up.

17:52.507 --> 17:53.588
Lemme ask,

17:54.606 --> 17:57.563
why you think the even bothering
to come at you the way they did?

17:58.090 --> 17:59.439
I mean, why you?

18:01.508 --> 18:03.392
See, all I know

18:05.516 --> 18:06.929
is that right there.

18:07.927 --> 18:10.335
I ain't never had
no use for other things.

18:11.878 --> 18:13.138
I could fight.

18:14.534 --> 18:17.821
For a time there,
I could run them corners.

18:19.477 --> 18:20.835
Not much life

18:22.030 --> 18:23.643
outside that, really.

18:25.278 --> 18:27.083
I was on a corner for a while.

18:27.245 --> 18:28.347
How that go?

18:34.237 --> 18:36.581
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is...not

18:37.448 --> 18:41.379
Everything comes down to
how you carry it in the street.

18:42.616 --> 18:45.956
I mean, it do come down to that
if you gonna be in the street.

18:48.179 --> 18:50.258
But that ain't the only way to be.

18:52.148 --> 18:54.018
- 'Round here it is.
- Yeah.

18:55.216 --> 18:56.603
'Round here it is.

18:59.284 --> 19:00.952
World is bigger than that.

19:01.112 --> 19:03.229
At least, that's what they tell me.

19:07.285 --> 19:10.856
Like... how do you get from here
to the rest of the world?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.845
I wish I knew.

19:23.185 --> 19:24.693
Michael grew up fast.

19:24.929 --> 19:26.763
Yeah, he did.

19:28.330 --> 19:33.249
Anyway, for a kid like that,
my onliest plan might be fine, you know?

19:34.222 --> 19:36.413
Might could work for
a boy like that.

19:37.459 --> 19:40.906
But a kid come to me
with other skills,

19:41.991 --> 19:43.450
other ways of being,

19:44.446 --> 19:46.788
all I got is hope and wishes.

19:48.420 --> 19:50.144
That's something, I guess.

19:50.843 --> 19:52.501
Wish it was more, son.

19:53.572 --> 19:54.566
I do.

20:02.762 --> 20:03.622
Thanks.

20:09.859 --> 20:10.966
Atta girl.

20:16.079 --> 20:17.582
Alma, you've got the investigation{itself}.

20:17.743 --> 20:19.612
Anything that breaks from headquarters.{, that's you.}

20:19.770 --> 20:23.104
I thought I'd work back on the victims.
A profile of who these guys were.

20:23.266 --> 20:27.034
That's a nice idea, but I already sent
Fletcher out on that about an hour ago.

20:27.192 --> 20:28.635
What's left for me to do?

20:28.796 --> 20:31.489
You can go and...
talk to the homeless.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.375
React quotes from the homeless?

20:34.533 --> 20:37.411
Just 'cause they're in the streets
doesn't mean that they lack opinions.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.999
Where am I gonna find homeless people?

20:41.732 --> 20:43.301
Not at home, I imagine.

20:43.871 --> 20:45.577
Go, go, my children.

20:50.869 --> 20:52.195
Read it and weep.

20:53.631 --> 20:54.846
I already did.

20:56.073 --> 20:57.443
So did the Major.

20:57.984 --> 20:59.310
So did the Colonel.

20:59.469 --> 21:01.642
So did our newly
christened deputy ops.

21:01.896 --> 21:03.765
Deputy's over at city hall right now.

21:03.924 --> 21:05.206
That was quick.

21:06.195 --> 21:08.142
Just 'cause you got
some fuckin' reporter

21:08.302 --> 21:11.459
to buy your weak shit does not mean
everyone else buys it.

21:14.169 --> 21:15.547
5 gets you 10,

21:15.708 --> 21:19.075
deputy's over there right now,
talking them back down to earth.

21:19.237 --> 21:20.869
Is this nut raping them?

21:21.473 --> 21:24.158
Well, I haven't debriefed
The investigators in detail,

21:24.318 --> 21:27.145
but the office reports don't indicate
penetration or ejaculation.

21:27.305 --> 21:29.383
What can we do?
What can we say we're doing already?

21:29.543 --> 21:31.040
We've got good people working it.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.735
{Obviously, }It would be better if I could
keep them on it around the clock.

21:33.896 --> 21:35.991
- You're talking overtime.
- If you could lift the cap

21:36.152 --> 21:37.957
- for this particular Investigation.
- Done.

21:38.116 --> 21:40.134
Unlimited overtime for two detectives.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.821
- Anything they need.
- Sir, a case like this,

21:42.981 --> 21:45.288
where we're proactively trying
to prevent additional murders,

21:45.448 --> 21:47.270
is going to require more
than two detectives.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.195
I got the school
board chairman telling me

21:49.355 --> 21:52.510
he's a short hair away from
laying off 50 middlechool teachers

21:52.669 --> 21:55.511
and shutting down special education
in every elementary school in the city

21:55.672 --> 21:58.224
in violation of a
federal consent decree.

21:58.383 --> 22:00.886
To the extent that I've got more
than an extra couple of dollars,

22:01.046 --> 22:03.144
you aren't getting it.
Embracing the hard choice.

22:03.304 --> 22:05.725
It's one of the--
One of the burdens of command.

22:06.145 --> 22:09.076
Is there anything you can do
to further protect the homeless?

22:09.341 --> 22:11.462
We can have trol units
spread the warning,

22:11.750 --> 22:15.154
try to convince anyone on the street to
move into the city shelters after dark.

22:15.315 --> 22:17.857
Can you have police sit on locations
where the homeless gather?

22:18.017 --> 22:20.454
- Monitor them like that?
- And still answer the calls?

22:20.613 --> 22:23.321
Not without doubling up post units,
which means overtime.

22:23.582 --> 22:24.820
Overtime, again.

22:25.029 --> 22:26.537
Blood in our veins, Mr. Mayor.

22:38.622 --> 22:40.786
Every day, you look more like a boss.

22:41.536 --> 22:44.146
- Fuck you.
- I didn't mean it like a bad thing.

22:44.306 --> 22:45.350
Yeah, you did.

22:45.509 --> 22:46.425
Yeah, I did.

22:48.582 --> 22:49.522
What's that?

22:49.682 --> 22:52.791
A gift from your one true partner
Cellphone number-- Marlo Stanfield.

22:52.949 --> 22:54.917
- How the fuck did you--
- Don't ask, don't tell.

22:55.077 --> 22:57.719
It's like one of tho guys
sucking dick in the army.

22:58.343 --> 23:00.442
Whatever else
I ever did to piss you off,

23:00.796 --> 23:02.412
remember I also did this.

23:03.321 --> 23:04.528
And, Carv?

23:04.688 --> 23:06.418
When you put the bracelets
on that bitch,

23:06.953 --> 23:09.419
remind him again of my fuckin' camera.

23:10.773 --> 23:13.226
You can tell all of 'em--
Royce, the caucus,

23:13.385 --> 23:16.395
all them Graspin' bitches who we put
in every city department--

23:16.553 --> 23:20.132
You tell every last one
that I do not fall alone.

23:20.888 --> 23:23.628
You think I'm gonna be the scapegoat
for the whole damn machine?

23:23.890 --> 23:25.734
Shheeeeeet.

23:26.432 --> 23:29.566
Clarence is going to stand with you.
He told me so. He'll be out there.

23:29.726 --> 23:32.697
Easy for him.
He ain't runnin' for nuthin' no more.

23:32.858 --> 23:35.064
I don't see you and
your kind with me on this.

23:35.224 --> 23:37.744
A whole mess o' people think
they belong on the fence, don't they?

23:37.905 --> 23:40.122
- It is what it is.
- Y'all better hope not.

23:40.282 --> 23:41.898
Or it ain't gonna
end with Clay Davis.

23:42.061 --> 23:44.324
Just take a moment and think
about what you're saying here.

23:44.484 --> 23:48.100
You can have yourself a pity party,
talk all kinda shit to some prosecutor.

23:48.325 --> 23:51.217
You know where you'll be then?
Out in the damn cold.

23:51.719 --> 23:53.915
No connections, no allies,

23:54.074 --> 23:56.548
nowhere to hang your hat
in this damn town.

23:57.326 --> 23:59.346
Or you carry this for all of us,

23:59.920 --> 24:01.801
carry it as far as you can.

24:01.963 --> 24:04.668
And if the worst happens,
if they take your seat,

24:04.828 --> 24:07.530
if you go away for a year or so
to some minimum-security summer camp,

24:07.691 --> 24:10.156
then so what?
You come home to a town

24:10.315 --> 24:12.414
that still knows your name.

24:15.666 --> 24:16.737
Look at Burrell.

24:16.898 --> 24:18.792
He goes quietly and now he's making

24:18.952 --> 24:21.453
12 a year more
than when he was commissioner

24:21.612 --> 24:23.372
and working half the hours.

24:23.532 --> 24:26.565
You think that happens
if he does the piss-and-moan?

24:27.721 --> 24:30.395
Prosecutors come
and prosecutors go.

24:32.499 --> 24:36.069
But win or lose, you still gonna be
back around before we know it.

24:38.384 --> 24:40.108
Am I right, Senator Davis?

24:48.535 --> 24:51.538
You want me to find another carry-out?
Someplace closer?

24:51.698 --> 24:53.465
- You don't like this food?
- I'm sayin',

24:53.624 --> 24:56.169
I don't like the way them
chinky muhfuckas be acting sometimes.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.176
The way they be lookin' at me.

24:58.574 --> 25:00.054
Don't worry about it.

25:06.059 --> 25:07.388
Chris with you?

25:08.425 --> 25:09.530
Behind me.

25:12.381 --> 25:13.712
What you got on?

25:13.955 --> 25:14.817
What?

25:17.879 --> 25:19.946
You want that faggot
to know we waitin' on his ass?

25:20.107 --> 25:21.488
Just bein' careful is all.

25:21.648 --> 25:24.578
If I can see the vest, you don't think
that he could see the vest?

25:24.738 --> 25:26.241
I'm the one{ that's} baitin' him, {	hough, }right?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.211
{It seems }I'm the only one
who's not hidin' out.

25:28.372 --> 25:29.373
Ain't no thing.

25:29.575 --> 25:31.142
'Cause when Omar comin' at you,

25:31.303 --> 25:33.063
he gon' be gunnin' at your head.

25:33.801 --> 25:35.336
I know I would be.

25:37.008 --> 25:40.381
Stayed outside of Monk's all night.
They left before morning though.

25:40.543 --> 25:42.324
They'll be back. No doubt.

25:43.547 --> 25:46.383
Do you hear a lot of concern
regarding these murders?

25:46.543 --> 25:48.965
- Haven't heard anybody mention it.
- No?

25:49.276 --> 25:52.174
Most of the folks we serve
aren't actually homeless.

25:52.870 --> 25:54.639
Most are working poor.

25:55.780 --> 25:58.072
So most of the people
I interviewed here weren't--

25:58.232 --> 26:00.622
Homeless? No.
Some, maybe.

26:01.895 --> 26:04.471
- Why didn't you--
- You seemed to be getting along OK.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.391
I didn't want to ruin it for you.

26:07.119 --> 26:08.875
Where would you suggest I go then?

26:09.839 --> 26:11.165
Streets maybe.

26:19.381 --> 26:21.223
The reporter
the "Sun" papers sent over?

26:21.875 --> 26:23.308
Not exactly Bob Woodward.

26:26.201 --> 26:27.638
Hell of a job, Bubs.

26:29.206 --> 26:30.744
But you know we need help tomorrow

26:30.904 --> 26:32.852
waiting tables in the back room.

26:34.125 --> 26:37.351
If you don't like it,
then I won't ask again.

26:44.851 --> 26:47.118
Gotta hold it
with both hands, you know?

26:47.278 --> 26:49.426
Tryin' to hit
what you aimin' at, a-ight?

26:49.584 --> 26:51.966
It's not like they do in the movies.
Not goin' to work.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.714
A-Ight, so come on,
spread your legs.

27:03.689 --> 27:07.427
What's the first thing you gotta do?
Jack a round in the chamber.

27:07.728 --> 27:09.082
Like this, watch.

27:10.122 --> 27:11.127
Go ahead.

27:18.058 --> 27:19.280
It's hard to do.

27:20.549 --> 27:21.390
A-Ight.

27:22.223 --> 27:23.170
So then...

27:24.070 --> 27:25.000
try this.

27:26.892 --> 27:30.365
It's a tool, just like a monkey wrench,
that's all it is, a-ight?

27:40.267 --> 27:41.837
I ain't know it was gon' be so loud.

27:41.995 --> 27:43.835
Why you even want to do this?

27:44.144 --> 27:45.846
What is you thinkin', duke?

27:46.429 --> 27:49.388
You think if you start carryin'
ain't nobody gonna try you?

27:49.788 --> 27:52.307
Nah.
Somebody's always gonna try you.

27:52.928 --> 27:56.191
An' if they know that you carryin' they
gonna make you Come out with it.

27:56.563 --> 27:59.894
An' once you come out with it,
you gotta be ready to go all the way.

28:01.295 --> 28:04.174
You can't bring it out
unless you willin' to use it.

28:04.897 --> 28:06.291
Can't be no doubt.

28:09.769 --> 28:11.250
Man, can't shoot,

28:12.127 --> 28:15.062
can't fight.
Can't even stand on the damn corner.

28:15.365 --> 28:18.193
You got other skills, man.
You smart like that.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.733
I don't know, Bunk.

28:20.894 --> 28:23.697
You can't believe
everything you read nowadays.

28:27.500 --> 28:29.203
Well, my little shit-stirrer.

28:31.490 --> 28:34.541
As per your request
for additional manpower and manhours,

28:35.098 --> 28:37.103
unlimited overtime has been approved

28:37.262 --> 28:39.843
for the investigation into
the killings of homeless men...

28:40.002 --> 28:42.503
for you and one
other detective only.

28:42.753 --> 28:44.631
What about surveillance teams?

28:45.218 --> 28:47.771
We need to be watching some of
these places, watching the smokehounds.

28:47.931 --> 28:49.211
Two detectives only.

28:49.372 --> 28:52.612
You and the stalwart detective Greggs
here are what has Been authorized.

28:52.897 --> 28:54.179
Nothing beyond that.

28:54.339 --> 28:57.112
What the fuck, Jay? I'm working
a serial killer here. It's a red ball.

28:57.271 --> 29:00.364
- Hence the overtime.
- But two detectives working a red ball?

29:01.141 --> 29:02.438
What{ the fuck's} wrong with this city?

29:02.599 --> 29:06.338
We need hours for a dozen men.
We need surveillance vehicles, cameras.

29:13.081 --> 29:14.338
What do you want from me?

29:14.499 --> 29:16.864
Ain't you still working that triple
from two weeks ago?

29:17.024 --> 29:18.815
I got stuff
I could run down on that, yeah.

29:18.975 --> 29:20.763
But Jay put me on this here.

29:23.114 --> 29:24.218
Come here.

29:30.761 --> 29:33.744
Do you even see how fucking wrong
you are? Do you even see it?

29:33.904 --> 29:35.586
They're gonna pay for this case, Bunk.

29:35.745 --> 29:37.572
- This is just the beginning.
- {Pay for }What case?

29:37.733 --> 29:40.231
You just took a real detective
off a real case behind your bullshit.

29:40.392 --> 29:41.453
I'll fix that.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.552
But eventually, these motherfuckers
are gonna pay

29:43.711 --> 29:45.650
out enough for us
to do Marlo Stanfield.

29:45.810 --> 29:47.179
Just watch and learn.

29:47.340 --> 29:49.672
You've lost your fucking mind.
Look at you.

29:49.980 --> 29:52.819
Half-lit every third night,
dead drunk every second.

29:53.013 --> 29:54.805
Nut deep in random pussy.

29:55.543 --> 29:57.682
And what little time you do
spend sober and limp-dicked,

29:57.842 --> 29:59.943
you're working murders
that don't even exist.

30:09.952 --> 30:12.028
Take the O.T. and work
the hell out of your triple.

30:12.188 --> 30:14.615
Don't worry about your office reports.
I cover you for the bosses.

30:14.774 --> 30:16.894
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just work your triple.

30:17.055 --> 30:19.163
I'll cover every hour
of it from my case file.

30:24.652 --> 30:26.025
Excuse me, sir. Sir.

30:28.284 --> 30:31.051
I'm with the "Baltimore Sun."
Can I talk with you a minute?

30:31.443 --> 30:33.121
You make an appointment?

30:34.533 --> 30:37.183
Sorry.
I'm booked up all afternoon.

30:37.420 --> 30:40.460
I'm doing a story on the homeless men
who've Been killed.

30:40.621 --> 30:42.123
You heard about that?

30:44.285 --> 30:45.893
You got two dollars on you, right?

30:46.055 --> 30:49.372
I was wondering if the murders
had changed things

30:49.532 --> 30:51.616
for you and the other
fellas out here.

31:07.546 --> 31:09.531
You wanna know about them murders?

31:09.692 --> 31:12.186
- That's why I'm out here.
- Wanna know who's doing it?

31:12.348 --> 31:14.577
- Do you know who's doing it?
- I do.

31:14.908 --> 31:16.565
Can you handle hearing it?

31:16.726 --> 31:17.759
What's your name?

31:17.917 --> 31:20.607
Nathan Levi Boston.

31:21.232 --> 31:22.801
And you know who the killer is?

31:22.960 --> 31:26.201
Do you believe Satan
walks the earth in a fleshly form?

31:26.363 --> 31:29.361
That satan can occupy
the souls of men?

31:29.903 --> 31:31.815
And he's just getting started.

31:33.512 --> 31:36.318
There's gonna be
a lot more dead before it's over.

31:37.216 --> 31:38.189
Hundreds.

31:38.350 --> 31:39.714
Maybe thousands.

32:02.119 --> 32:04.412
They told me they still had you
working outta this shithole,

32:04.572 --> 32:05.785
but I didn't believe it.

32:06.002 --> 32:08.996
It ain't much, but it's been months
since a boss has been able to find me.

32:09.157 --> 32:12.194
You still have some interest
in Marlo Stanfield, right?

32:14.734 --> 32:15.973
That's his cell.

32:16.976 --> 32:18.342
He stopped using cellphones.

32:18.501 --> 32:19.338
Ellis.

32:19.848 --> 32:20.598
How?

32:21.441 --> 32:23.767
Police work, detective.
Police work.

32:37.671 --> 32:39.155
Yo, this the high hat?

32:39.597 --> 32:40.637
<i>Say what?</i>

32:40.796 --> 32:42.809
Y'all still open for carryout?

32:43.239 --> 32:46.321
<i>- I want some of that pepper steak.
- Wrong number, fool.</i>

32:50.788 --> 32:53.004
I wish I could tell you
it's a shock.

32:53.557 --> 32:56.211
But it seems to happen
in every city where we get us

32:56.372 --> 32:59.639
a place inside the power structure
and we become targets.

32:59.982 --> 33:01.153
I know you're right.

33:01.314 --> 33:03.145
I'm not saying
it's a black-white thing.

33:03.305 --> 33:05.687
The state's attorney,
Mr. Bond, he's black.

33:05.847 --> 33:09.674
But if it serves his purpose--
Gets his name in the news,

33:09.835 --> 33:10.995
ups his profile--

33:11.157 --> 33:13.705
He'll do whatever the folks
pulling the strings want him to do.

33:13.864 --> 33:18.653
Whether it be character assassination,
tie the noose in the rope, whatever.

33:19.163 --> 33:20.994
But they picked
the wrong man this time.

33:21.154 --> 33:22.938
They must not 'a heard
about you, Senator.

33:23.097 --> 33:24.865
- I don't run from a fight.
- I know that.

33:25.025 --> 33:27.753
'Cause the people know--
Now I'm talkin' 'bout the people now--

33:27.913 --> 33:30.021
The people know
what I've done for west Baltimore

33:30.180 --> 33:31.426
and this city as a whole.

33:31.586 --> 33:33.761
They know the battles I fight
in Annapolis every day.

33:33.919 --> 33:36.429
They know these charges
ain't nothing but B.S.

33:36.759 --> 33:38.223
Hey, hold it now.
It's radio.

33:38.383 --> 33:40.058
I gotta hold my tongue, I know.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.897
I don't want nobody pullin'
y'all's broadcasting license,

33:43.058 --> 33:44.773
So I can't say it like I feel it.

33:44.933 --> 33:47.568
But I wanted to come here
on your show tonight--

33:47.727 --> 33:50.631
And thank you so much
for the opportunity, my brother--

33:50.791 --> 33:54.869
But I wanted your listeners to be
the first to hear it from my mouth.

33:55.115 --> 33:57.113
I have committed no crime,

33:57.742 --> 34:00.505
And I am gonna keep on doing the
people's work without breaking stride.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.297
I want to thank you for that, senator.

34:02.455 --> 34:05.157
And also I want everybody to know,
lighty dine, everybody to know

34:05.318 --> 34:08.047
there's going to be a gathering
at the Mitchell courthouse

34:08.205 --> 34:09.531
tomorrow at 2:00

34:09.864 --> 34:11.703
So that people can be heard on this.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.638
And I hope they come out
in good numbers.

34:13.799 --> 34:15.500
2:00 on Calvert street.

34:15.659 --> 34:18.437
- It's time to lift every voice.
- I heard that.

34:18.597 --> 34:22.246
3 detectives for a 24-hour wiretap.

34:22.908 --> 34:25.608
4 more for a couple
2-man surveillance teams.

34:25.768 --> 34:27.402
A pair of unmarked cars.

34:27.679 --> 34:29.690
I'm not asking the world here, Cedric.

34:29.851 --> 34:32.119
Lester, if I had it, you'd have it.

34:32.277 --> 34:34.414
That's the cell number
of the motherfucker

34:34.574 --> 34:36.751
who put 22 bodies on us.

34:36.938 --> 34:39.197
- Go to the fucking mayor!
- I've been to the mayor.

34:39.358 --> 34:41.257
I've been to him
on my knees twice already.

34:41.418 --> 34:42.806
Once for your case, remember?

34:42.967 --> 34:46.014
And all I could bring back was
2 men to work Clay Davis.

34:46.175 --> 34:49.063
And yesterday, for the serial
killer that homicide was working?

34:49.224 --> 34:50.178
2 men only.

34:50.667 --> 34:53.080
I've done my job.
I've gone up the ladder every time.

34:53.241 --> 34:56.768
But if a{ fucking} serial killer can't bring back
more than a couple detectives,

34:56.927 --> 35:00.291
What the hell does it matter
that you have a fresh phone number?

35:07.778 --> 35:10.776
More manpower's been assigned,
according to the P.I.O.

35:13.546 --> 35:14.430
And?

35:15.270 --> 35:16.587
I led with the first victim.

35:16.747 --> 35:19.215
Ex-Marine.
Bronze-Star in Vietnam.

35:19.474 --> 35:22.378
His family begged him to come home,
which he would do now and then,

35:22.538 --> 35:25.455
but they hadn't seen him
in a month before the murder.

35:25.614 --> 35:26.625
Good shit.

35:27.002 --> 35:28.184
Real good shit.

35:28.342 --> 35:29.926
Late, but you got the goods, right?

35:30.087 --> 35:32.051
Half of these guys in the streets
are whack jobs,

35:32.211 --> 35:33.816
the other half
just want to borrow *.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.268
But yeah, I got good stuff.

35:38.188 --> 35:40.803
Got a family of 4
under the Hanover street bridge.

35:41.135 --> 35:43.827
Father broke down and cried
when I talked to him,

35:43.987 --> 35:47.540
Talking about how he couldn't protect
himself, couldn't protect his kids.

35:47.701 --> 35:50.375
Mother just kept stroking
the youngest one's blonde hair.

35:50.536 --> 35:51.945
We got names on this, right?

35:52.454 --> 35:53.920
Guy's name is, um...

35:55.871 --> 35:58.171
Boston.
Nathan Levi Boston.

35:58.888 --> 36:00.845
OK, you got 30 inches,
if you need them.

36:01.005 --> 36:04.063
You're going off the front
in a package with Alma and Fletch.

36:04.350 --> 36:07.395
Olesker wrote a pretty damn good
column, too, for Metro front.

36:07.650 --> 36:09.009
Go, go. Write, write.

36:09.182 --> 36:13.079
This serial killer is making
one Baltimorean very, very happy.

36:14.228 --> 36:15.543
Clay Davis.

36:16.072 --> 36:18.910
One news cycle, and his indictment's
gonna be off the front page.

36:19.070 --> 36:21.234
Well, if it bleeds, it leads.

36:22.052 --> 36:23.481
A fucking serial killer.

36:23.640 --> 36:26.477
I give them a sex-crazed madman
who's enough of a freakshow

36:26.637 --> 36:29.385
to get the whole city hot and bothered
and what comes back?

36:29.544 --> 36:31.061
One fucking detective.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.744
And who is it? Kima Greggs,
who should be working her triple.

36:34.903 --> 36:38.507
So now I can't give you her hours
without fucking up honest casework.

36:38.794 --> 36:41.169
Well, now it's easier, Jimmy.
We don't need as much.

36:41.328 --> 36:42.892
Now we need a wiretap.

36:43.356 --> 36:44.979
I can monitor that myself.

36:45.334 --> 36:48.140
Shit, anything we get up
is gonna be illegal anyway.

36:48.298 --> 36:51.278
So we don't want anyone
getting near it. Sydnor, maybe.

36:51.668 --> 36:52.729
I can trust him.

36:52.889 --> 36:55.277
You start pulling information
off that phone,

36:55.577 --> 36:59.045
You're gonna need at least a couple
of surveillance cars in the street.

36:59.205 --> 37:00.757
We'll worry that when we get there.

37:00.916 --> 37:04.042
The important thing is that
he's making it easy for us.

37:04.308 --> 37:06.824
Before, with all that face-to-face,
we were gonna need what?

37:07.822 --> 37:09.590
Remote cameras, microphones,

37:09.751 --> 37:12.344
half-a-dozen guys
working surveillance 24 hours.

37:12.504 --> 37:15.653
But now he's talking on a phone,
and I got him.

37:16.895 --> 37:19.856
So how do we squeeze a wiretap
out of my serial killer?

37:22.699 --> 37:24.245
He's gotta call someone.

37:24.948 --> 37:25.766
Who?

37:26.782 --> 37:27.844
The Mayor.

37:28.370 --> 37:29.477
Cardinal Keeler.

37:29.747 --> 37:31.944
Cal fucking Ripken.
Who gives a fuck?

37:35.024 --> 37:37.372
A bullshit number on the paperwork
to the courthouse,

37:37.862 --> 37:40.070
Marlo's cell number on the tap itself.

37:41.264 --> 37:42.899
This is fucking genius...

37:44.517 --> 37:45.446
or not.

37:50.834 --> 37:53.456
If that's about your case,
you need to answer it.

37:53.617 --> 37:55.558
Remember you're working a serial killer.

37:55.718 --> 37:57.348
Nah, it's my ex-wife.

37:58.380 --> 38:01.448
I called her all night.
Like I got time for a fucking bullshit.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.632
Thing is, they got to believe

38:03.793 --> 38:06.323
it's your killer calling
before they'll pay for a wiretap.

38:06.598 --> 38:07.994
Well, fine. Fuck it.

38:08.154 --> 38:10.410
Call your buddy Oscar.
Tell him we need another body.

38:10.570 --> 38:12.994
This time the sick motherfucker
is gonna call Mr. Ripken

38:13.153 --> 38:15.565
with something
only the killer could know.

38:16.518 --> 38:18.838
That should shake 'em up enough
for a couple of wiretaps.

38:36.973 --> 38:39.070
Monk sure do like to retire early.

38:41.311 --> 38:43.032
3 go in and 1 come out.

38:43.344 --> 38:44.599
Better odds.

38:46.784 --> 38:50.521
We're gonna wait on it though.
They'll get better still.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.419
If not tonight, then the next.

38:54.533 --> 38:56.014
You're a patient man.

38:56.302 --> 38:57.396
You, too.

39:16.691 --> 39:18.613
I tried to reach you
on your cell all day long.

39:18.774 --> 39:21.540
- I called Beadie, {she said }she had no idea...
- I know, I know. It's my fault.

39:21.699 --> 39:22.618
They still up?

39:23.152 --> 39:23.948
Yes.

39:28.575 --> 39:29.628
Hey, guys.

39:29.939 --> 39:30.935
Hey, dad.

39:32.304 --> 39:33.338
Listen, Sean.

39:33.499 --> 39:36.483
I wanted you to know I did everything
I could to get to your play tonight.

39:38.666 --> 39:39.763
Hey, Mike.

39:45.668 --> 39:47.330
It's cool.
No worries.

39:49.070 --> 39:51.861
Your mom said you were great.
Why don't you it now?

39:52.022 --> 39:53.642
- Let me hear it.
- I dunno.

39:53.995 --> 39:56.728
It's lame like that.
You gotta see the whole play.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.130
- What band is that?
- Dead Meadow.

40:08.290 --> 40:09.131
Dead metal?

40:09.291 --> 40:10.549
Meadow.
Dead Meadow.

40:12.435 --> 40:14.800
What the hell's wrong
with the Ramones?

40:18.719 --> 40:21.914
I'll make it up to them next weekend.
Take 'em to the ballgame or something.

40:22.955 --> 40:24.441
This is life, Jimmy.

40:24.601 --> 40:26.518
This is the stuff that actually matters.

40:26.679 --> 40:27.623
I know.

40:27.783 --> 40:29.069
I talked to Beadie.

40:30.207 --> 40:32.699
She knows she's losing you.
Like I knew.

40:32.859 --> 40:34.436
I'm not judging.

40:34.923 --> 40:37.233
I'm not saying this hurt you.

40:37.808 --> 40:39.124
But she knows.

40:39.284 --> 40:42.377
And she's ready for it,
the way that I was ready for it.

40:42.746 --> 40:43.968
You're drinking.

40:44.364 --> 40:47.008
You're out all night.
She doesn't know where you are.

40:47.169 --> 40:48.820
And she's no fool, Jimmy.

40:49.527 --> 40:52.389
I'm sad that it wasn't with me,

40:54.998 --> 40:56.490
but I'm glad for you.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.833
I know, you can imagine that?

41:01.187 --> 41:03.197
I was glad that you found her.

41:05.410 --> 41:07.266
I was glad for her, even.

41:09.034 --> 41:12.205
For a while there, you were happier
than I'd ever seen you.

41:13.092 --> 41:14.175
She's great.

41:15.713 --> 41:16.708
She is.

41:19.340 --> 41:20.379
Don't do this.

41:35.177 --> 41:36.016
Hey.

41:41.476 --> 41:42.934
You all right, Bubs?

41:43.508 --> 41:45.785
I'm good, I'm good.

41:46.956 --> 41:48.749
'Cept for somethin'
that's been on my mind.

41:48.911 --> 41:51.429
- But I see you into somethin' though...
- I can take a minute.

41:51.589 --> 41:52.867
Need to find somethin' out.

41:53.027 --> 41:56.164
But at the same time,
I don't know if I really wanna know.

41:57.674 --> 42:00.133
It's best to know, Bubs.
I'm living proof.

42:00.293 --> 42:02.082
They got drugs an' shit now.

42:02.461 --> 42:04.096
Why's it on your mind now?

42:04.692 --> 42:07.700
Been volunteering down Viva house,
doin' like you told me.

42:07.987 --> 42:09.935
Man say he want me to serve food.

42:10.233 --> 42:12.461
You can. It don't travel like that.

42:12.795 --> 42:13.940
I know they say so,

42:14.099 --> 42:15.229
but I feel...

42:16.312 --> 42:17.239
I dunno.

42:18.217 --> 42:20.130
I went down to the clinic
on my own yesterday,

42:20.291 --> 42:21.981
Got as far as the door, but...

42:22.141 --> 42:23.614
Tough to go alone.

42:24.613 --> 42:25.423
Yeah.

42:26.925 --> 42:28.206
Gimme 10 minutes.

42:31.330 --> 42:33.165
So where do we take it today?

42:34.266 --> 42:36.676
Unless the story develops,
I think we've covered the bases.

42:36.835 --> 42:40.553
I'd say that Alma can check on things
and see where we're at by afternoon.

42:40.715 --> 42:43.309
You owe me a govans story.
And you need to get with Shane and

42:43.468 --> 42:45.465
figure out what's going on
with that school series.

42:45.626 --> 42:47.545
I dunno, Gus.
I think this thing has legs.

42:47.704 --> 42:49.595
Maybe I go out with the cops
on their rounds.

42:49.755 --> 42:51.649
- Watch 'em warn the homeless.
- Good thought,

42:51.808 --> 42:54.760
but Alma can work that
into whatever file she has.

43:07.255 --> 43:08.117
Hey.

43:09.498 --> 43:10.348
Busy?

43:10.812 --> 43:12.652
Naw, just, uh...

43:16.021 --> 43:17.412
Jimmy's not in yet.

43:18.340 --> 43:20.301
I know.
He's sleeping one off.

43:22.230 --> 43:24.940
- Late night, huh?
- They're all like that now.

43:26.799 --> 43:29.006
Relax.
I'm not looking for a snitch.

43:29.514 --> 43:31.581
I know you're his partner
in crime. I don't care.

43:32.688 --> 43:35.075
I just want to know from you
where this is going.

43:35.235 --> 43:38.734
I mean, you know him. You know
what it is that he can and can't do.

43:39.198 --> 43:40.679
Dunno if I can speak on that.

43:40.838 --> 43:42.928
Look, I'm ready to put him out. OK?

43:43.327 --> 43:44.853
For me, for my kids...

43:45.646 --> 43:47.952
I mean, if in the end,
if this is all there is to him.

43:48.113 --> 43:51.093
If he can't be better than this,
I just want to know.

43:51.392 --> 43:53.390
He's working this case right now.

43:55.266 --> 43:56.527
Serial killer, actually.

43:56.983 --> 43:59.238
You are not gonna try
to tell me this is about a case.

43:59.398 --> 44:01.563
- Try that shit on some civilian.
- Look,

44:01.724 --> 44:04.270
he'll get his head in a certain place,
he'll take a drink.

44:04.430 --> 44:06.137
I mean, a lot of us will.

44:06.557 --> 44:08.701
It's more than just
a drink he's taking.

44:08.861 --> 44:10.977
Beadie, I can't tell you what to do.

44:15.639 --> 44:17.141
I don't like giving up.

44:21.962 --> 44:24.989
OK, I gotta go back to work.
Thanks for letting me vent.

44:33.422 --> 44:36.126
Hey, you want to get started today?
Sooner we decide on a school--

44:36.286 --> 44:37.650
After lunch, yeah.

45:26.504 --> 45:28.096
Finally found a line, huh?

45:28.490 --> 45:31.083
Know that wasn't easy.
They been hidin' for years.

45:31.359 --> 45:32.375
I'm a pro.

45:32.773 --> 45:33.670
Me, too.

45:34.740 --> 45:35.898
Lemme ask you...

45:37.290 --> 45:38.841
When do results come back?

45:39.965 --> 45:41.712
'Bout an hour from this test.

45:42.473 --> 45:43.389
Here ya go.

45:43.844 --> 45:48.436
And they want you to believe that
there's only one side to this story,

45:48.837 --> 45:52.274
and that their so-called facts
cannot be denied.

45:52.669 --> 45:56.070
But we have some facts
of our own, don't we?

45:57.398 --> 45:59.281
We know who our leaders are.

45:59.734 --> 46:03.363
And we don't want them
picking our leaders for us, do we?

46:03.624 --> 46:04.530
No!

46:04.690 --> 46:08.994
And we will not stand idly by
as they singled out our leaders

46:09.154 --> 46:13.462
and selectively prosecute--
Or should I say persecute them--

46:13.620 --> 46:18.316
just because they have the courage
and the fortitude to stand up for us.

46:20.938 --> 46:22.141
Let them hear you.

46:22.302 --> 46:24.894
Let them hear you
loud and clear.

46:26.228 --> 46:29.900
Clay Davis isn't going
anywhere, is he?

46:30.061 --> 46:30.981
No!

46:31.245 --> 46:32.446
We need him,

46:32.739 --> 46:34.153
we're going to keep him,

46:34.565 --> 46:37.618
and damn anyone who says otherwise.

46:37.780 --> 46:39.122
Clay Davis!

46:45.744 --> 46:48.967
What the fuck is this I hear
about you might not stand tall on this?

46:49.128 --> 46:50.669
You got that wrong, old friend.

46:50.830 --> 46:53.136
- I'm gonna carry this.
- You damn sure better.

46:53.295 --> 46:55.567
Because if you don't you won't be able

46:55.726 --> 46:57.946
to squeeze another
greenback outta this town

46:58.106 --> 47:00.112
for the rest of your natural life.

47:00.575 --> 47:04.357
* We shall not be--
We shall not be moved *

47:10.723 --> 47:11.806
Lookey here.

47:12.515 --> 47:14.689
- The fuck is that?
- Change of pace.

47:16.194 --> 47:18.601
They look kinda hot
with their clothes on.

47:21.820 --> 47:23.567
Hey, clarice.

47:24.924 --> 47:27.091
Your serial killer
called the "Baltimore Sun".

47:27.251 --> 47:29.878
Some goof claiming to be your guy
called a reporter over there.

47:30.037 --> 47:32.680
- One of the guys writing this shit up.
- It's gotta be a crank call.

47:32.970 --> 47:34.057
Probably so.

47:34.216 --> 47:36.203
But seeing as
it's the fucking newspaper,

47:36.460 --> 47:39.814
you go over there
and you set them straight.

47:57.549 --> 47:58.500
Go 'head.

48:07.788 --> 48:08.761
Negative.

48:12.594 --> 48:15.069
- Negative means...
- I know what it means.

48:17.182 --> 48:19.442
- Must be wrong.
- It ain't wrong.

48:19.604 --> 48:21.055
All the shit I done.

48:22.050 --> 48:23.420
All the works I shared.

48:23.580 --> 48:24.822
My best boy years back?

48:24.983 --> 48:26.966
I fired off the same hype
as him dozens of times.

48:27.127 --> 48:28.782
He had the bug for sure.

48:30.895 --> 48:32.995
That shit ain't right nohow, man.

48:34.544 --> 48:35.937
You're disappointed.

48:37.039 --> 48:38.970
Shit, this ain't
about the bug, is it?

48:39.132 --> 48:42.887
This is you, tryin' to make the past
be everything, mean everything.

48:43.045 --> 48:45.908
You don't even wanna think
about the here and now.

48:46.327 --> 48:47.586
Sorry, Bubs.

48:48.317 --> 48:50.607
Shame ain't worth
as much as you think.

48:52.065 --> 48:53.149
Let it go.

48:57.563 --> 49:01.114
He said he wanted people to know there'd
be 12 bodies before he's finished.

49:01.515 --> 49:03.923
He said, "I came to take 12."

49:04.423 --> 49:07.247
I said, "what happens after 12?"
He said,

49:07.405 --> 49:09.095
"I go somewhere else."

49:09.716 --> 49:12.502
I asked him about the bite marks.
He said that they wanted him to bite,

49:13.011 --> 49:14.326
that they asked for that.

49:14.484 --> 49:17.647
He complained that the article
made him sound like a pervert.

49:17.809 --> 49:20.653
I asked him if he was
angry at the men.

49:21.273 --> 49:22.138
He hung up.

49:22.443 --> 49:25.644
He called you on your cellphone?
Why didn't he call the paper?

49:25.804 --> 49:29.857
I was all over the city yesterday
handing my cards out to homeless men.

49:30.179 --> 49:32.410
He probably got the number from a card.

49:32.719 --> 49:34.361
Shit, I might'a handed him a card.

49:34.523 --> 49:37.421
I think this is the guy. I mean,{ detective,}
a chill ran down my back.

49:37.581 --> 49:38.866
There's no way to know.

49:39.345 --> 49:42.496
If it's {one other}another nut, we're gonna look
like fools if we print any of this.{un any of this in print.}

49:42.655 --> 49:44.832
Your cellphone caught the number?
He dialed you.

49:44.991 --> 49:48.224
I dialed it back. Payphone
on south Hanover near West street.

49:53.529 --> 49:55.364
- What did he sound like?
- What do you mean?

49:55.523 --> 49:56.966
You talk to people for a living.

49:57.127 --> 49:58.891
Did he sound black, white?
Younger, older?

49:59.050 --> 50:00.465
High-pitched voice or low?

50:00.742 --> 50:02.908
He sounded, to me, like a white guy.

50:03.180 --> 50:06.648
Not a deep voice, but calm,
almost monotone.

50:07.492 --> 50:09.353
He sounded older,
I would say,

50:09.512 --> 50:11.736
40s.
Not a real young guy.

50:11.897 --> 50:14.407
- Can I have your notebook?
- You can't have his notes.

50:14.566 --> 50:17.462
As this isn't a confidential source,
we won't invoke the Maryland shield law,

50:17.622 --> 50:20.163
But he'll type up a copy
and give them to you.

50:20.322 --> 50:23.041
But the actual document
is property of the "Baltimore Sun."

50:23.203 --> 50:25.753
So type it up, like now.

50:25.914 --> 50:28.405
So, you're saying
this could be the killer.

50:28.869 --> 50:30.642
Can we talk off-the-record?

50:31.860 --> 50:34.723
The homicide unit
received a phone call this morning

50:34.883 --> 50:37.019
from a payphone
from the same neighborhood,

50:37.178 --> 50:41.004
and based on Scott's voice description,
and the use of the number 12,

50:42.838 --> 50:46.067
Well, let's just say we need to find
whoever it was made both those calls.

50:46.301 --> 50:47.695
He made another call?

50:47.897 --> 50:49.674
Detective, as a newsman,

50:50.117 --> 50:52.478
I'm inclined to include
these details in our coverage

50:52.638 --> 50:56.080
if there's a credible chance the killer
was really in contact with our reporter.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.750
Would doing so have any negative
effect on your investigation?

50:59.112 --> 51:02.188
Actually, these calls
are our best means of finding this guy.

51:02.498 --> 51:05.868
Every call he makes, every word
he says-- To you and to us--

51:06.029 --> 51:07.636
Can only provide information.

51:08.420 --> 51:11.474
- If we do run a story--
- {But }You can't say he's contacting police.

51:11.634 --> 51:14.226
You can't print that part of it
under any circumstances.

51:14.567 --> 51:16.301
OK, then how do we characterize

51:16.459 --> 51:18.438
what the police think
about this call to Scott?

51:18.669 --> 51:21.786
You can say that we're...
taking it seriously.

51:22.692 --> 51:24.309
Going forward, is it possible that

51:24.468 --> 51:27.481
you would grant
a one-party consent for us to...

51:28.017 --> 51:30.178
monitor your reporter's
cellphone and office phones?

51:30.338 --> 51:32.396
- Absolutely not.
- I'm sorry, detective,

51:32.555 --> 51:34.254
but our ability to report is dependent

51:34.415 --> 51:37.769
upon our maintaining the confidentiality
of our conversations.

51:38.455 --> 51:41.547
Now, we're perfect willing
to share with you the information

51:41.707 --> 51:44.720
that this individual has as he's
definitely not a confidential source.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.314
But we're not going to consent
to the Baltimore police department

51:47.475 --> 51:48.975
monitoring our phones.

51:49.135 --> 51:51.852
- You'll tap the payphone, I guess.
- Don't print that either.

51:52.011 --> 51:54.792
Don't print anything about
where the killer calls from.

51:55.190 --> 51:56.400
He'll change up.

51:58.656 --> 52:00.469
Well, I'll type up my notes quick.

52:01.993 --> 52:03.386
Big story for you guys, huh?

52:03.548 --> 52:06.829
Well, 10 minutes ago I'd'a said
this whole thing was complete bullshit.

52:07.168 --> 52:08.893
Shows what I know, I guess.

52:21.932 --> 52:24.120
<i>... which is why
I'm going to fight this thing.</i>

52:24.280 --> 52:28.096
<i>I am innocent and I have done
nothing except serve the people.</i>

52:28.257 --> 52:29.687
<i>Oh, I believe you, Senator.</i>

52:29.846 --> 52:32.301
<i>I've seen all the good work
you've done for the community.</i>

52:32.461 --> 52:33.914
<i>You definitely have my sup...</i>

52:44.873 --> 52:46.598
That's Eddie Cantor, right?

52:47.062 --> 52:47.946
No.

52:49.563 --> 52:50.667
It's perfect.

52:51.397 --> 52:53.725
McNulty, it's perfect.

52:54.002 --> 52:56.021
I couldn't believe it.
I'm sitting there.

52:56.180 --> 52:57.602
All this bullshit coming at me,

52:57.762 --> 52:59.699
thinking,
Christ, this is a waste of time.

52:59.859 --> 53:02.107
Then I realized:
this is the wiretap.

53:02.269 --> 53:03.858
Right here.
They're giving it to me.

53:04.018 --> 53:05.852
Never mind me
making a crank call to someone.

53:06.013 --> 53:08.852
This right here is Lester Freamon's
motherfucking wire.

53:18.246 --> 53:19.794
What if they check this?

53:20.261 --> 53:24.000
How many guys in this unit
have ever hooked up a wiretap?

53:24.161 --> 53:27.512
They don't know
which wire goes where.

53:28.152 --> 53:30.341
Explain it to me again,
because I tell ya,

53:30.563 --> 53:32.761
I think I'm a smart guy,
but this shit makes my head hurt.

53:33.205 --> 53:35.172
They think they're up
on your killer's cellphone,

53:35.333 --> 53:37.389
but they'll never catch
a call because this...

53:37.810 --> 53:38.916
...goes nowhere.

53:39.074 --> 53:42.337
And meanwhile, using the same
court authorization,

53:42.497 --> 53:44.694
I'm up on the live wire
down at the detail office,

53:44.855 --> 53:47.110
Listening to Marlo.
Every day,

53:47.539 --> 53:49.301
you file office and court reports

53:49.461 --> 53:52.459
saying there's been no further
contacwith the serial killer.

53:52.621 --> 53:54.145
I file exactly nothing,

53:54.610 --> 53:59.324
but use what I hear
to rig the case on our real target.

53:59.743 --> 54:02.281
- And when it goes to court...
- there's no mention of a wiretap.

54:02.440 --> 54:04.380
- It's all based on a C.I.
- There it is.

54:04.542 --> 54:06.851
4 copies signed by the judge.

54:07.361 --> 54:08.643
Emergency order

54:08.802 --> 54:14.149
for telephonic intercept
of a cellphone, number 915-0909.

54:14.843 --> 54:16.852
If the machine is rigged,
you're good to go.

54:17.285 --> 54:19.163
- You're up.
- Good hunting.

54:19.324 --> 54:20.313
- Holley?
- Yo!

54:20.473 --> 54:22.034
You got midnight shift.

54:22.607 --> 54:24.654
Worden'll be in
to relieve you at 6:00.

54:24.942 --> 54:28.314
After Worden, my squad will pick
up monitoring on the dayshift.

54:33.229 --> 54:34.356
Excuse me.

54:35.086 --> 54:36.479
Don't look so pissy.

54:36.638 --> 54:38.945
We're actually
paying overtime for this.

55:40.909 --> 55:41.867
O-Dog!

55:44.273 --> 55:45.287
My leg!

55:45.798 --> 55:47.213
Stay the fuck down!

56:32.568 --> 56:33.651
What the...

56:39.195 --> 56:40.211
Damn.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.172
What the...

57:18.305 --> 57:24.827
