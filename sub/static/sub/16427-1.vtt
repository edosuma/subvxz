00:38.370 --> 00:41.672
The I-10
Santa Monica Freeway westbound...

00:41.673 --> 00:43.808
<i>is jammed due to
a three-car accident...</i>

00:43.809 --> 00:46.477
<i>blocking lanes one and two
just past Hoover Street.</i>

00:46.478 --> 00:50.114
<i>In Van Nuys there's stop and go
traffic on the 405 southbound...</i>

00:50.115 --> 00:53.103
<i>Hey, loser. Get up.
you're late.</i>

00:54.485 --> 00:55.852
We need money.

00:55.853 --> 00:57.120
For what?

00:57.121 --> 00:59.783
Food.

01:06.631 --> 01:09.299
I've only got two dollars.
How much a Happy Meal?

01:09.300 --> 01:10.535
<i>Oopf.</i>

01:13.370 --> 01:15.006
<i>Good morning, Thea.</i>

01:15.007 --> 01:16.405
Oh, hi.

01:16.406 --> 01:18.607
<i>There's this
thing called rent.</i>

01:18.608 --> 01:20.675
Monday.
you have my word.

01:20.676 --> 01:22.877
Could you put your word
on an actual check, sometime?

02:28.743 --> 02:32.012
<i>Whoo.
Look at that foxy momma.</i>

02:32.013 --> 02:33.445
Hey.

02:33.446 --> 02:37.150
Hey, look. I... uh,
I saved you one of these.

02:37.151 --> 02:39.352
It wasn't easy.
These people are animals.

02:39.353 --> 02:41.621
Thanks. It's all downhill
after the donut.

02:41.622 --> 02:43.821
Hey. Let's go
camping right now.

02:43.822 --> 02:45.793
Oh, don't tempt me.
you know I can't.

02:45.794 --> 02:49.862
Come on. Don't be such a buzz kill.
Just call in sick from work.

02:49.863 --> 02:52.664
Oh, Miles. It was hard
enough getting Monday off.

02:52.665 --> 02:55.436
Hey. you really need to
bail on this lame job, babe.

02:55.437 --> 02:59.962
Bailing isn't exactly in my vocabulary
right now. I'm late. I'm late.

03:06.613 --> 03:09.239
Alarm clock
on the fritz again?

03:10.016 --> 03:11.615
<i>Thea.</i>

03:11.616 --> 03:14.105
<i>Thea</i>

03:17.458 --> 03:19.357
Four minutes
after nine, Thea.

03:19.358 --> 03:21.293
We agreed to 8:59.

03:21.294 --> 03:23.927
I know. I'm sorry. I've
got your coffee piping hot.

03:23.928 --> 03:26.431
Greg already
got it for me.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.299
All right.
Let's get started.

03:28.300 --> 03:31.135
I found two errors
in your transcription.

03:31.136 --> 03:34.971
Ur-Nammu, the Mesopotamian ruler,
has a hyphen in his name.

03:34.972 --> 03:37.975
Are you sure? I checked it
in Oxford English Dictionary.

03:37.976 --> 03:41.411
<i>you should always cross reference
with the Military Encyclopedia.</i>

03:41.412 --> 03:42.980
It is
the definitive source.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.547
Absolutely right, Greg.

03:44.548 --> 03:47.418
The intern shouldn't be
more thorough than you.

03:47.419 --> 03:51.587
you have to remember that every
mistake you make, impacts history.

03:51.588 --> 03:53.588
I'm sorry I didn't give
enough thought...

03:53.589 --> 03:56.127
to the long reaching
impact of a missing hyphen.

03:56.128 --> 03:58.461
Think of it next time,
or someone else will.

03:58.462 --> 04:01.998
<i>There are a million people out
there who'd kill for your job.</i>

04:01.999 --> 04:05.600
<i>The secretary to the publisher,
It's a dream for so many of us.</i>

04:05.601 --> 04:08.139
I have a big
project for you.

04:08.140 --> 04:11.908
Now, you can make up for this
morning's mistakes by acing this one.

04:11.909 --> 04:13.741
Okay.
What can I do for you?

04:13.742 --> 04:17.379
MacArthur rolled
in some poop.

04:17.380 --> 04:18.745
Again?

04:18.747 --> 04:20.415
<i>She's got one
good eye, Thea.</i>

04:20.416 --> 04:24.713
I don't appreciate
you taking that tone. Now.

04:26.087 --> 04:27.890
Hi, there.

04:27.891 --> 04:31.926
Let's really try and nail
it this time, shall we?

04:40.269 --> 04:42.103
No way.
She rolled in poop again?

04:42.104 --> 04:43.403
Uh-hm.

04:43.404 --> 04:45.137
How come Greg never washes her?

04:45.138 --> 04:47.743
I'm glad that I don't have
to wash the poop off Greg...

04:47.744 --> 04:50.845
since he spends most of his time
with his head up Jerry's ass.

04:50.846 --> 04:53.880
<i>Tell me about It. Last week he
C~C'd me on an email to Jerry...</i>

04:53.881 --> 04:56.817
<i>complaining that I ordered
too many rainbow Post-its.</i>

04:56.818 --> 04:58.687
<i>Said it creates
a party atmosphere.</i>

04:58.688 --> 05:00.854
<i>Come here, MacArthur.</i>

05:00.855 --> 05:03.590
MacArthur.

05:03.591 --> 05:05.990
Do you think we'll
ever get out of here?

05:05.991 --> 05:09.329
How long 'till your little
sister graduates college?

05:09.330 --> 05:11.398
Five years.
Five long years.

05:11.399 --> 05:13.500
Wow.

05:13.501 --> 05:16.368
When you finally ditch this
place I'm gonna leave, too.

05:16.369 --> 05:18.606
I can't survive this
hellhole without you.

05:18.607 --> 05:21.707
I don't even know if I'm gonna
survive Monday without you.

05:21.708 --> 05:24.077
Oh, well, your rainbow
Post-its should help.

05:24.078 --> 05:26.779
Ha, ha, ha.
Okay, just promise me...

05:26.780 --> 05:29.874
that when you're celebrating
with Miles the big 2~5,

05:29.875 --> 05:31.216
you'll have two
extra shots for me.

05:31.217 --> 05:33.885
Done. Two for you,
two for me...

05:33.886 --> 05:35.452
<i>and two
for MacArthur.</i>

05:35.453 --> 05:37.690
<i>And cold beer chasers
and a sliced lime.</i>

05:37.691 --> 05:39.225
Gets me right here.

05:43.329 --> 05:44.895
What is MacArthur eating?

05:44.896 --> 05:47.766
Oh, that's not good.
Hold on.

05:47.767 --> 05:49.927
<i>No, no, that's soap</i>

05:53.807 --> 05:56.138
Well, Thea,
you are a sopping mess.

05:56.139 --> 05:57.542
I know, I'm sorry.

05:57.543 --> 05:58.810
Well, don't apologize.

05:58.811 --> 06:00.544
This one has two staples.

06:00.545 --> 06:01.646
Yeah. And?

06:01.647 --> 06:03.047
It's bad feng shui.

06:03.048 --> 06:04.616
<i>It'd be nice
to give the agenda</i>

06:04.617 --> 06:06.749
to the guy
the disability first.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.753
When I gave you yours
first last month,

06:08.754 --> 06:11.555
you reprimanded me for
giving you special treatment.

06:11.556 --> 06:13.924
I don't like your giving
me special back talk.

06:13.925 --> 06:16.626
<i>Good morning, everyone.
Ready for Abbott?</i>

06:17.763 --> 06:19.197
Sorry.

06:19.198 --> 06:21.063
<i>Let's have another round.</i>

06:21.064 --> 06:24.400
Hey, Johnny, my good man.
How's the book coming?

06:24.401 --> 06:25.533
<i>Jerry I</i>

06:25.534 --> 06:27.770
War. What is
it good for?

06:27.771 --> 06:31.742
Apparently lots of things,
Jerry.

06:33.443 --> 06:36.378
If you could just tell us
what chapter you're up to.

06:36.379 --> 06:37.579
Sweet.

06:37.580 --> 06:39.049
<i>Pigs In the blanket</i>

06:39.050 --> 06:41.218
<i>for everybody on me.</i>

06:41.219 --> 06:43.686
Alright, bye-bye.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.853
<i>Hemingway used to write In bars.</i>

06:45.854 --> 06:49.725
Ah. We're so pleased you decided to
bless us with your presence, Nicky

06:49.726 --> 06:52.794
Sorry, uh, bad,
bad traffic.

06:52.795 --> 06:55.763
Hm. Got hung up at the
divorce lawyer's office?

06:55.764 --> 06:58.769
I kind of wanted that
to be private, Jerry.

06:58.770 --> 07:01.369
Well, well, privacy is
for people who are on time.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.438
<i>So how's Abbott's book coming?</i>

07:03.439 --> 07:08.243
Extremely well. There's a
method to his mad genius.

07:08.244 --> 07:11.745
And now we're ready to
go over the cost report.

07:11.746 --> 07:13.814
Whenever you feel
like presenting it.

07:13.815 --> 07:15.849
Oh, okay.

07:15.850 --> 07:20.055
<i>Sales for The Complete History
of Bullets are below projections.</i>

07:20.056 --> 07:23.490
Uh, marketing says people
have been intimidated

07:23.491 --> 07:25.392
by the 1400 page length.

07:25.393 --> 07:29.096
There are a lot of bullets
in the world. We're not making it up.

07:29.097 --> 07:32.166
Let's talk about the next
order of order of business.

07:32.167 --> 07:35.637
I've given this a lotta thought.

07:35.638 --> 07:39.273
Next week's softball game.

07:39.274 --> 07:43.143
Now, we're all tired
of losing to Presidio.

07:43.144 --> 07:45.446
So I'm moving Garth
to short stop.

07:45.447 --> 07:47.312
I'm not
quite finished.

07:47.313 --> 07:51.018
I've told you. you're staying
in left field. We need you there.

07:51.019 --> 07:52.685
This isn't softball related.

07:52.686 --> 07:55.154
<i>you know our textbook
writer, Suzie Cavendish?</i>

07:55.155 --> 07:56.255
Of course I know her.

07:56.256 --> 07:57.589
<i>I read her new manuscript</i>

07:57.590 --> 07:59.460
and I thought
it was really good.

07:59.461 --> 08:01.927
How did you
get a manuscript?

08:01.928 --> 08:04.463
I ran into her at lunch.
She told me about her book.

08:04.464 --> 08:06.963
you don't send the
accountant your manuscript.

08:07.985 --> 08:10.436
Thanks, but I've already
told Susie it's not for us.

08:10.437 --> 08:12.305
It's not our
subject matter.

08:12.306 --> 08:14.706
Baby, what's wrong?

08:14.707 --> 08:18.075
<i>MacArthur?</i>

08:18.076 --> 08:21.682
<i>What's wrong with you?
Come here, baby.</i>

08:21.683 --> 08:24.349
<i>What is wrong?
Talk to daddy.</i>

08:27.852 --> 08:29.119
<i>Ew</i>

08:29.120 --> 08:31.989
<i>What did you feed her?</i>

08:31.990 --> 08:33.791
I'm so so sorry
about your dog.

08:33.792 --> 08:37.227
I just scheduled a full body
scan for MacArthur on Monday.

08:37.227 --> 08:39.831
I have the day off Monday
but I'll take her Tuesday.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.366
you'll take her Monday.

08:41.366 --> 08:43.433
I asked for this time
off two months ago.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.602
It's just one day.
I promised my boyfriend

08:45.603 --> 08:47.605
we'd go camping
for his 25th birthday.

08:47.606 --> 08:49.240
It's his 25th birthday?

08:49.241 --> 08:50.510
Yeah, it is.

08:50.511 --> 08:52.776
<i>God, I had no Idea.</i>

08:52.777 --> 08:55.378
I'm sorry. Why don't you
take the whole week off?

08:55.379 --> 08:56.479
Really?

08:56.480 --> 08:57.913
No!

08:57.914 --> 09:00.885
Okay, no problem.

09:00.886 --> 09:03.019
<i>Come on, things
can't be that bad.</i>

09:03.020 --> 09:06.022
Okay. Let's see what I have
to look forward to in life.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.823
Washing my boss's dog.

09:07.824 --> 09:09.724
Blow-drying my boss's job.

09:09.725 --> 09:10.960
Uh-mm.

09:10.961 --> 09:12.796
Taking my boss's
dog for a OAT scan.

09:12.797 --> 09:14.731
I'm officially
a pathetic loser.

09:14.732 --> 09:18.563
Well, at least we still
have Skittles and cigarettes.

09:20.203 --> 09:23.105
<i>Maybe you and Miles
can reschedule the weekend.</i>

09:23.106 --> 09:26.676
<i>Oh, yeah. I'll see If
Miles can reschedule his birthday.</i>

09:26.677 --> 09:28.543
No, maybe Jerry's
onto something.

09:28.544 --> 09:31.815
Who needs a significant other
when you're dating your own dog?

09:31.816 --> 09:35.083
<i>Jerry's repulsive. Have
you smelled breath lately?</i>

09:35.084 --> 09:37.286
<i>He's lucky he can get
a dog to date him.</i>

09:37.287 --> 09:41.291
<i>you know, it's one thing if Jerry is an
undersexed jerk who takes no joy in life</i>

09:41.292 --> 09:44.792
<i>But why does he have to make the
rest of us that way? I hate him I</i>

09:47.094 --> 09:50.791
In my office. Now!

09:51.701 --> 09:55.403
you've got some pretty strong
opinions about my personal choices.

09:55.404 --> 09:57.604
you find my relationship
with MacArthur

09:57.605 --> 09:59.071
something to deride?

09:59.072 --> 10:01.510
Not at all. I respect
your devotion to animals.

10:01.511 --> 10:03.812
<i>You're Involvement
with PETA is inspiring.</i>

10:03.813 --> 10:05.012
Don't bullshit me.

10:05.013 --> 10:06.481
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

10:06.482 --> 10:08.714
It was childish
and it won't happen again.

10:08.715 --> 10:10.583
If you hate me so much,

10:10.584 --> 10:14.153
I don't really think it's healthy
for you to continue working with me.

10:14.154 --> 10:16.223
But, please. you can't do this.

10:16.224 --> 10:17.324
Watch me.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.424
But I need this job.

10:18.425 --> 10:19.525
<i>Here I go.</i>

10:19.526 --> 10:20.626
I support my sister.

10:20.627 --> 10:21.729
You're fired.

10:21.730 --> 10:22.830
<i>But I'm...</i>

10:22.831 --> 10:24.763
You're what? You're?

10:24.764 --> 10:25.898
I'm pregnant.

10:25.899 --> 10:27.066
Pregnant?

10:27.067 --> 10:29.502
Yes, pregnant.
Totally pregnant.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.906
<i>The doctor says the chemicals
or hormones or whatever...</i>

10:32.907 --> 10:37.076
are messing up my system and you can't
take anything I say too seriously.

10:37.077 --> 10:40.807
Except for when I say I'm
pregnant because, I am.

10:47.954 --> 10:50.079
<i>Oh, God.</i>

10:59.230 --> 11:00.363
When are you due?

11:00.364 --> 11:02.300
October.
I mean, October.

11:02.301 --> 11:03.701
October what?

11:03.702 --> 11:05.737
Uh, probably the 6th.
Could be the 7th,

11:05.738 --> 11:08.406
could be the 8th. But fingers
are crossed for the 6th

11:08.407 --> 11:10.573
by then I'll just want
this thing out of me.

11:10.574 --> 11:12.578
You're almost four
months pregnant?

11:12.579 --> 11:14.479
Yeah.
Isn't that crazy?

11:14.480 --> 11:18.683
Feels like yesterday I wasn't.
But I was because I'm four months

11:18.684 --> 11:21.318
The legal department
is backing your story

11:21.319 --> 11:24.123
about not being able
to fire a pregnant woman

11:24.124 --> 11:27.990
no matter how much
she might deserve it.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.560
So get back to work.

11:30.561 --> 11:32.230
Thank you
so much, Jerry.

11:32.231 --> 11:36.791
I really appreciate it.
Thank you. From both of us.

11:40.436 --> 11:44.942
Congratulations on the baby. The
entire legal department is thrilled.

11:44.943 --> 11:48.412
Hey, why didn't you tell
me earlier? Oh, I know.

11:48.413 --> 11:51.580
Probably because there's so
much that can go horribly wrong.

11:51.581 --> 11:54.884
I mean, I'm out of the woods. But
I do everything right.

11:54.885 --> 11:58.220
Anyway, so I'm having my baby
first, not that it's a competition.

11:58.221 --> 12:00.055
But I win!

12:00.056 --> 12:02.993
Anyway, no, really,
congratulations.

12:02.994 --> 12:06.027
<i>Oh, Theal Oh, I'm so excited for you.</i>

12:06.028 --> 12:08.598
No wonder you've been
spacey lately.

12:08.599 --> 12:09.931
<i>What's going on?</i>

12:09.932 --> 12:11.900
<i>Everybody, Thea's pregnant I</i>

12:11.901 --> 12:13.869
Don't look at me.
I never touched her.

12:13.870 --> 12:16.737
<i>Never would have
guessed. you still look sexy.</i>

12:16.738 --> 12:19.573
I had to tell everyone.
Couldn’t keep it a secret.

12:19.574 --> 12:22.878
Of course. How can you
hide that kind of thing?

12:22.879 --> 12:26.715
<i>I should've known. My left
knee's been hurtling. When my knee hurts,</i>

12:26.716 --> 12:28.750
<i>it usually means
someone's pregnant.</i>

12:28.751 --> 12:32.721
Yeah, or they're stuck underwater
in a car. Anyway, I'm glad it's this.

12:32.722 --> 12:35.357
So who's the very lucky fella?

12:35.358 --> 12:37.859
you didn't tell
'em the rest of the news?

12:37.860 --> 12:39.694
<i>Thea and Miles
are engaged I</i>

12:39.695 --> 12:42.461
<i>O</i>

12:42.462 --> 12:45.099
That's so great!

12:45.100 --> 12:49.670
I mean, I got married before I got
pregnant, but better late than never.

12:49.671 --> 12:51.236
Whoo-hoo!
Yay for you!

12:51.237 --> 12:53.474
Yeah, I'm, I'm really
excited, everyone.

12:53.475 --> 12:56.909
Yeah, thrilled. Over
the moon. Way over it!

12:59.780 --> 13:01.974
Psst.

13:06.654 --> 13:08.888
Pregnant? It's brilliant.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.588
Where did you
come up with that?

13:10.589 --> 13:13.360
I saw it on an episode
of Law and Order.

13:13.361 --> 13:15.429
Yeah. you can't fire
a pregnant woman.

13:15.430 --> 13:18.097
Discrimination, lawsuits,
bad mojo, whatever.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.565
Smart.

13:20.566 --> 13:22.266
By the way,
thanks for your help.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.872
Pregnant wasn't bad enough.
I had to get engaged.

13:24.873 --> 13:28.540
Well, I didn't want people to think
you were some kind of wayward skank.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.676
Is that what you
think of single mothers?

13:30.677 --> 13:34.312
No, of course not. I just happen to
know that a lot of people in the office

13:34.313 --> 13:37.849
think you're a wayward skank and I
thought this could turn it around.

13:37.850 --> 13:41.619
<i>Thanks. Crap, Lisa. What am I
gonna do? How will I get out of this?</i>

13:41.620 --> 13:45.091
Can’t we just say that you
know, something happened to,

13:45.092 --> 13:48.993
I don't know, one
of your tubes. Sprung a leak.

13:48.994 --> 13:51.029
Do you know what
you're talking about?

13:51.030 --> 13:53.364
Let's just go along with
it for a little while

13:53.365 --> 13:55.367
and then we'll say
it was a false alarm.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.935
you thought you were pregnant, but
it turns out you just had crabs.

13:58.936 --> 14:01.096
Ew.

14:07.278 --> 14:10.146
I'm so sorry, Em.
I had a crazy day at work

14:10.147 --> 14:13.016
<i>and I lost track of time.
Am I too late?</i>

14:13.017 --> 14:16.954
The meeting was at four and it's
five o'clock now. you do the math.

14:16.955 --> 14:19.855
I'm really sorry.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.257
Have you been drinking?

14:22.258 --> 14:25.124
I had a cocktail.

14:25.896 --> 14:30.093
Come on. you're 17. you should
be out drinking and smoking

14:34.872 --> 14:38.240
I'll reschedule with your
guidance counselor next week.

14:38.241 --> 14:41.909
Don't bother. I already met with M
is Talbot and we discussed my options

14:41.910 --> 14:44.112
What options?

14:44.113 --> 14:47.582
She suggested I start taking
some cooking classes after school.

14:47.583 --> 14:50.252
you have
tennis after school.

14:50.253 --> 14:52.619
Yeah, but I'm
sick of tennis.

14:52.620 --> 14:57.126
I was thinking maybe I could go to the
Culinary I institute in San Francisco.

14:57.127 --> 14:59.794
No way. you're staying right
here and going to U O LA.

14:59.795 --> 15:03.864
Tennis will cover the tuition and I'm
busting my ass off to cover the rest.

15:03.865 --> 15:07.936
I know. you keep telling me when Mom
and Dad died, we lost out on options.

15:07.937 --> 15:10.106
Just do me a favor,
be a grown-up...

15:10.107 --> 15:12.141
and accept the hand
that you've been dealt.

15:12.142 --> 15:13.639
So that's
what you do?

15:13.640 --> 15:15.543
Yeah, that's
what I do.

15:15.544 --> 15:20.877
Really? 'Cause you were at a bar
instead of my parent teacher conference.

15:28.456 --> 15:30.824
Oh, hello, M r. Abbott.

15:30.825 --> 15:33.593
Jerry? Jerry,
where are you?

15:33.594 --> 15:35.063
M r. Abbott,
can I help you?

15:35.064 --> 15:37.530
Is there anything
to drink in this place

15:37.531 --> 15:39.999
or do I have to go to my
car and get my divining rod?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.801
I could get you
some water.

15:41.802 --> 15:45.239
Go ahead, soldier. Three
parts scotch, one part water.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.240
Okay. Move, move,
move. Hey, soldier.

15:47.241 --> 15:48.874
What brings
you to the office?

15:48.875 --> 15:52.044
How are you? Well,
your brother wants my book.

15:52.045 --> 15:55.145
Jerry's at lunch. But Thea can
take your manuscript for you

15:55.146 --> 15:56.750
Who's Thea?

15:56.751 --> 15:59.251
Jerry's secretary. you
talk to her every day.

15:59.252 --> 16:03.421
Congratulations are probably in order.
Thea has good news. She's having a baby

16:03.422 --> 16:04.755
H m.

16:04.756 --> 16:07.259
She looks like
she's strong stock.

16:07.260 --> 16:12.231
<i>Maybe she can give us
a strong future Marine.</i>

16:12.232 --> 16:14.064
<i>Thea, do you have a minute?</i>

16:14.065 --> 16:15.634
So, uh, how are you?

16:15.635 --> 16:17.703
Fine, thanks. you?

16:17.704 --> 16:20.174
Oh, I'm fine.
But I'm not the one...

16:20.175 --> 16:22.809
with a magical bundle of joy
growing inside of me.

16:22.810 --> 16:25.845
So, no morning sickness?
No bloating?

16:25.846 --> 16:28.712
No. N... uh... unh.
Guess I'm just really lucky.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.480
A little too lucky,
if you ask me.

16:30.481 --> 16:31.647
Yeah.

16:31.648 --> 16:34.115
And uh, where
is your ring?

16:34.116 --> 16:36.521
<i>Well, we...</i>

16:36.522 --> 16:39.157
Her fiancée is saving
up for her ring.

16:39.158 --> 16:41.825
It's not very nice to
try to embarrass people.

16:41.826 --> 16:46.490
So why don't you get back to lying
about your self on your dating websites?

16:49.001 --> 16:52.502
Don't worry about him. He doesn't
know anything. He's an idiot.

16:52.503 --> 16:55.435
And I'm sure Greg
is still a virgin.

16:56.741 --> 16:58.242
<i>Come on, Jerry.</i>

16:58.243 --> 16:59.809
<i>O Alright, Jerry.</i>

16:59.810 --> 17:01.110
Oh! Watch!

17:01.111 --> 17:02.311
Dumbass.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.512
<i>Come on, Nick.</i>

17:04.512 --> 17:06.415
<i>Come on Nick, you can do it.</i>

17:15.125 --> 17:16.294
Hit it!

17:16.295 --> 17:17.561
Ow!

17:17.563 --> 17:19.627
<i>Ball. Take your base.</i>

17:19.628 --> 17:20.996
<i>Take your base</i>

17:20.997 --> 17:23.265
<i>Come on, Thea.</i>

17:23.266 --> 17:24.397
<i>Come on, Theal</i>

17:24.398 --> 17:25.767
<i>Let's go, Theal</i>

17:26.904 --> 17:28.503
<i>Go, go. Home run.</i>

17:28.505 --> 17:29.905
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

17:29.906 --> 17:32.965
Go, go.
Get home, get home.

17:33.943 --> 17:35.676
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

17:37.413 --> 17:38.814
Safe!

17:41.417 --> 17:42.550
Are you okay?

17:42.551 --> 17:44.709
Yeah. I'm great.

17:45.518 --> 17:48.289
<i>Come on, Colonel.
you can do it.</i>

17:48.290 --> 17:49.489
<i>you got it I</i>

17:49.490 --> 17:50.558
<i>Great.</i>

17:50.559 --> 17:51.693
<i>Thea.</i>

17:51.694 --> 17:54.627
Kristen. Come
here, please now.

17:54.628 --> 17:58.767
you shouldn't be
playing in your condition.

17:58.768 --> 17:59.967
What condition?

17:59.968 --> 18:01.635
your baby.

18:01.636 --> 18:03.672
<i>Lisa, get your ass out on base?</i>

18:03.673 --> 18:04.938
Of course.

18:04.939 --> 18:07.108
We're taking you out.
For the season.

18:08.311 --> 18:11.709
All season.

18:12.646 --> 18:15.179
<i>Come on I</i>

18:15.180 --> 18:16.682
Hey, thanks
for the RBI.

18:16.683 --> 18:18.819
Yeah, well,
no more RBIs.

18:18.820 --> 18:22.521
Jerry says I'm a liability, so
I can't play 'cause I'm pregnant.

18:22.522 --> 18:26.514
Sounds like the most reasonable
opinion he's had in years.

18:26.559 --> 18:28.429
Oh!

18:36.034 --> 18:38.060
Yes!

18:48.749 --> 18:50.281
MacArthur?

18:50.282 --> 18:51.782
Good heavens.

18:51.783 --> 18:54.987
Oh, it's okay. I'm
coming for you, baby.

19:04.329 --> 19:06.262
I need a copy
of Abbott's manuscript.

19:06.263 --> 19:09.267
I'm gonna read it in the car
on the way to his funeral.

19:09.268 --> 19:12.203
What? you've never seen a
manuscript on napkins before?

19:12.204 --> 19:15.072
When genius strikes, you
write it down. Do it now.

19:15.073 --> 19:17.300
Okay.

19:20.512 --> 19:24.615
Oh. Thea, um, should you
still be using the copier?

19:24.616 --> 19:27.482
Copy machines emit
electro magnetic waves.

19:27.483 --> 19:29.252
And what does that do?

19:29.253 --> 19:32.622
Well, no one knows yet. But I've
been reading on the message boards

19:32.623 --> 19:35.227
and it seems like something
you should avoid...

19:35.228 --> 19:36.826
if you're trying to have
a well pregnancy.

19:36.827 --> 19:38.396
I think I should be okay.

19:38.397 --> 19:42.065
Oh, good. Well, if it
doesn't bother you,

19:42.066 --> 19:44.334
then can you make 50
copies of that for me?

19:44.335 --> 19:46.995
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:48.440 --> 19:50.207
you know, I,
I find it fascinating

19:50.208 --> 19:52.808
that Kristen is only a
month further along than you

19:52.809 --> 19:56.610
<i>and yet she's the size of a school bus
and you're still the size of Kate Moss.</i>

19:56.611 --> 19:59.182
Different strokes,
I guess.

19:59.183 --> 20:03.352
Perhaps it's easier to feel
the bump than to see it.

20:03.353 --> 20:06.887
What's the big deal? Everyone
likes to touch a pregnant stomach.

20:06.888 --> 20:10.086
Because you're
a gross weirdo, Greg.

20:10.895 --> 20:14.863
And the baby doesn't
like gross weirdoes, Greg.

20:15.165 --> 20:16.663
mpf.

20:16.664 --> 20:19.793
you and me are going
shopping after work.

20:31.014 --> 20:32.979
What on earth
are you doing?

20:32.980 --> 20:34.414
I'm stealing
you a belly.

20:34.415 --> 20:35.550
What?

20:35.551 --> 20:37.084
You're four
months pregnant

20:37.085 --> 20:39.555
and you've got the abs
of a Jenku swimsuit model.

20:39.556 --> 20:41.155
Sh. Cover me. Okay?

20:41.156 --> 20:43.923
Look. If you want people
to think you're pregnant,

20:43.924 --> 20:49.054
<i>you've gotta start talking the
talk and walking the... waddle</i>

20:50.532 --> 20:52.099
I don't know
if I can do this.

20:52.100 --> 20:54.301
you can do this.
Just do it for a week.

20:54.302 --> 20:58.070
But you've gotta look the part or
people are gonna get suspicious.

20:58.071 --> 21:00.575
I look ridiculous.

21:00.576 --> 21:02.909
These jeans
are elastic on the top.

21:02.910 --> 21:05.278
I feel like I'm wearing
a condom on my stomach.

21:05.279 --> 21:09.213
you don't look like
you've been anywhere near a condom.

21:09.214 --> 21:13.986
Gross. Did you know that when
women are in labor they sometimes poop?

21:13.987 --> 21:15.554
Ew.

21:15.555 --> 21:19.389
Have you ever heard of an
episiotomy? Or cackles? Hmm?

21:19.390 --> 21:20.693
Agh.

21:20.694 --> 21:23.761
Well, we should get
this as a reference.

21:23.762 --> 21:26.799
I thought this whole thing was
gonna blow over in a few days.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.504
Yeah, but until then you should know
the ins and outs of being preggers.

21:30.505 --> 21:33.605
There's a whole world of stuff
here you know nothing about.

21:33.606 --> 21:36.440
Yeah. And I'd kind of
like to keep it that way.

21:36.441 --> 21:38.909
Ew. Look
at those nipples.

21:38.910 --> 21:40.446
Wait a second,
wait a second.

21:40.447 --> 21:41.547
What?

21:41.548 --> 21:42.947
Here. Here.

21:42.948 --> 21:45.115
No. Can I keep
the stomach at your house?

21:45.116 --> 21:47.450
No. That's like keeping
your arm at my house.

21:47.451 --> 21:50.688
No, no. I don't want Emma to
find out and she hates when I lie.

21:50.689 --> 21:51.790
you lie all the time.

21:51.791 --> 21:53.057
No, really.

21:53.058 --> 21:56.423
It stays with you.
It's your stomach.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.871
Hey! Can I get
a little privacy?

22:08.872 --> 22:11.576
Whoa, what are you doing in
there? Can I just come in?

22:11.577 --> 22:13.242
I'm trying
to talk to you.

22:13.243 --> 22:17.213
It doesn't matter what I'm
doing right now, I am busy. Shoo.

22:19.249 --> 22:21.618
Morning, Thea,
you got my check?

22:21.619 --> 22:25.320
Wow. Look at you.

22:25.321 --> 22:28.389
Yeah, look at me.
Oh, it's not what, um...

22:28.390 --> 22:31.394
Oh, gee, I mean. you've
obviously got a lot on your plate.

22:31.395 --> 22:34.696
I'm sorry about the other day.
Don't worry about the rent check.

22:34.697 --> 22:36.731
Take another
week or two.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.432
you just take
care of your self.

22:38.433 --> 22:40.836
Oh, my God.

22:40.837 --> 22:44.006
Oh, how
exciting.

22:44.007 --> 22:46.042
I have so much baby
stuff I can lend you.

22:46.043 --> 22:48.642
Let me know if you need to
borrow my old breast pump.

22:48.643 --> 22:49.876
I just have
to rinse it.

23:09.163 --> 23:12.200
<i>My favorite
lubricant, Ann? WD-40.</i>

23:12.201 --> 23:16.170
<i>Thea. I've made some
brownies for you to fatten you up.</i>

23:16.171 --> 23:17.270
Oh, thank you.

23:17.271 --> 23:18.570
It popped.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.640
Yeah, once you pop,
you can't stop.

23:20.641 --> 23:23.611
You're carrying low.
It's definitely a boy.

23:23.612 --> 23:27.413
Whatever it is, you've obviously
begun that slippery slide into obesity.

23:27.414 --> 23:30.349
Well, you had a nice run
there, didn't you, champ?

23:30.350 --> 23:32.954
Oh, good morning.

23:32.955 --> 23:35.022
Look at you.

23:35.023 --> 23:37.690
Oh, my God. I think
I just felt it kick.

23:37.691 --> 23:40.758
Oh. Yeah, mark it in the
baby journal for me, will you?

23:40.759 --> 23:41.995
I will.

23:41.996 --> 23:43.363
Are people buying it?

23:43.364 --> 23:45.931
Totally. Totally.
Ann made me brownies.

23:45.932 --> 23:48.000
I got a seat
on the bus today.

23:48.001 --> 23:50.167
And Garts not
attracted to me anymore.

23:50.168 --> 23:52.239
It's the best morning
I've had in years.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.973
Okay, you want to hear
something even more amazing?

23:54.974 --> 23:57.175
Have you read Abbott's
new manuscript?

23:57.176 --> 23:59.011
I get asked
to Xerox, not to read.

23:59.012 --> 24:02.082
Okay. Get ready
to have your mind blown.

24:02.083 --> 24:05.616
Ah, " Philip of Macedon
had a hard-on. "

24:05.617 --> 24:08.352
"Scaled great peaks
to conquer the Greeks. "

24:08.353 --> 24:10.888
It's all rhyming couplets
and dirty limericks.

24:10.889 --> 24:14.158
And this is what Jerry's
betting the bank on.

24:14.159 --> 24:15.693
It's insane.

24:15.694 --> 24:17.888
Oh, you're welcome.

24:20.698 --> 24:22.533
Well, you
look different.

24:22.534 --> 24:25.469
Sorry. I'll move you to the
shitty corner in a second.

24:25.470 --> 24:28.573
It's all right, dear.
you've got your hands full.

24:28.574 --> 24:30.839
you've exploded.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.900
Well, yes, she has.

24:36.014 --> 24:38.649
Well, people. I'm sure
you'll be relieved to hear

24:38.650 --> 24:42.320
that MacArthur is expected
to make a full recovery.

24:42.321 --> 24:44.055
I've gotten her a spot

24:44.056 --> 24:47.524
at the McElroy Center for Veterinary
Rehabilitation in Bethesda.

24:47.525 --> 24:49.426
It's the best in the country.

24:49.427 --> 24:53.164
They tell me she should be at 90
percent tail-wagging capability

24:53.165 --> 24:54.498
<i>after just six weeks.</i>

24:54.499 --> 24:56.565
I'll be out of
the office for a while.

24:56.566 --> 24:59.167
<i>I'll be working out of the
rehab center In Bethesda</i>

24:59.168 --> 25:02.372
where I've taken a room for the
duration of MacArthur's stay.

25:02.373 --> 25:05.909
U until I get back, Nicky
will be holding down the fort.

25:05.910 --> 25:09.111
I'm giving him strict instructions
not to do anything stupid.

25:09.112 --> 25:10.912
Code red.

25:10.913 --> 25:13.249
Seriously, Nick.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.115
Don't blow it.

25:17.287 --> 25:18.954
Check it out.

25:18.955 --> 25:22.122
There's our fearless leader
plotting our brilliant future.

25:22.123 --> 25:25.493
<i>Well at least with him
In charge, I'm off the hook.</i>

25:25.494 --> 25:27.762
Well, things
are looking up.

25:27.763 --> 25:30.430
Okay, let's figure out how
to get me out of this mess.

25:30.431 --> 25:34.136
I'll Google what kind of mishaps
can happen when you're pregnant.

25:34.137 --> 25:36.203
Hey, guys.
Sorry to bother you.

25:36.204 --> 25:39.707
You're boss now, Nick.
You can bother us anytime you want.

25:39.708 --> 25:46.407
Right. U m, Thea, I kind of need
a favor. Would you, come with me?

25:48.349 --> 25:50.050
We're meeting
Susie Cavendish.

25:50.051 --> 25:52.452
I mentioned her in
the meeting last week.

25:52.453 --> 25:55.555
<i>you see, Suzie’s written
this hilarious book</i>

25:55.556 --> 25:58.992
about pregnancy. It, it's true
stories about pregnant women

25:58.993 --> 26:03.063
getting stuck in bathtubs and
throwing up under their desks at work

26:03.064 --> 26:05.899
and farting
by mistake in meetings.

26:05.900 --> 26:09.536
It, it's stuff you, you must know
a lot more about than me, obviously.

26:09.537 --> 26:11.669
Yeah, totally. Totally.

26:11.670 --> 26:15.074
I'm trying really, really
hard not to fart right now.

26:15.075 --> 26:18.478
Anyway, I want
to publish Susie’s book

26:18.479 --> 26:21.479
and, and while Jerry's
gone, I'm gonna do it.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.817
<i>you know, carpe deem
and all that stuff.</i>

26:23.818 --> 26:25.585
Yeah, definitely.

26:25.586 --> 26:29.622
I actually used to be a pretty
carpe diem kind of person myself.

26:29.623 --> 26:30.890
But not anymore.

26:30.891 --> 26:32.190
Because I'm pregnant.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.994
See, that's just it.

26:33.995 --> 26:36.995
Susie’s not convinced that
Steinwald's the right place.

26:36.996 --> 26:40.364
<i>So I thought you might
help convince her otherwise.</i>

26:40.365 --> 26:42.031
Yeah, sure.

26:42.032 --> 26:46.367
I mean, I'll just talk to her
about the whole farting thing.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.874
Uh, one thing. Uh, Susie
kind of thinks you're an editor.

26:50.875 --> 26:52.509
Why would
she think that?

26:52.510 --> 26:54.113
I kind of implied it.

26:54.114 --> 26:55.215
What?

26:55.216 --> 26:56.315
Susie!

26:56.316 --> 26:58.850
. N ice to see you.

26:58.851 --> 27:02.852
<i>Most pregnancy books
make you feel totally Inadequate</i>

27:02.853 --> 27:05.457
and how you're destined to
be a failure as a parent.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.091
No one writes about what
pregnancy is really like,

27:08.092 --> 27:10.627
how you feel fat and clumsy and stupid.

27:10.628 --> 27:12.595
<i>The absolute worst</i>

27:12.596 --> 27:16.366
is "What to Expect When you're
Expecting. " Have you read that?

27:16.367 --> 27:21.071
Oh, no, I was told it was so
bad I shouldn't even go near it.

27:21.072 --> 27:22.939
So, what are you reading?

27:22.940 --> 27:25.509
Uh,

27:25.510 --> 27:28.544
<i>you know, just
the usual suspects.</i>

27:28.545 --> 27:30.112
Like?

27:30.113 --> 27:34.452
Well, I was banking on
finding Pregnancy for Dummies.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.086
I love
that series. Yeah.

27:37.087 --> 27:39.422
<i>H m. I interesting.</i>

27:39.423 --> 27:41.691
<i>Come on, Nicky, how can
you guys sell my book</i>

27:41.692 --> 27:44.124
if you're not familiar
with the competition?

27:44.125 --> 27:46.597
Thea has had a pretty
full workload lately.

27:46.598 --> 27:50.466
I don't know, guys. I don't know
if this is the right marriage.

27:50.467 --> 27:53.867
<i>Come on. From the people who
brought you the Kalashnikov diaries</i>

27:53.868 --> 27:57.438
comes a comedic send-up
of 21st century pregnancy?

27:57.439 --> 28:00.442
It's just, the right
home is so important.

28:00.443 --> 28:02.109
I know. We are
the right home.

28:02.110 --> 28:06.315
I mean, sure, our, uh,
plumbing is a little leaky

28:06.316 --> 28:08.783
and maybe we need
a new paint job.

28:08.784 --> 28:12.953
<i>But our backyard is a really great
place for a barbecue In the summer.</i>

28:12.954 --> 28:16.392
you know?

28:16.393 --> 28:18.495
If we can make a bestseller...

28:18.496 --> 28:21.229
outta the Defeat of Darius at Issus
we've gotta be good.

28:21.230 --> 28:23.195
I mean, that couldn't
be easy, right?

28:23.196 --> 28:25.000
Absolutely.

28:25.001 --> 28:27.735
<i>The thing about pregnancy
is It's Incredibly messy.</i>

28:27.736 --> 28:30.703
Those other books are teaching
you how to avoid the mess.

28:30.704 --> 28:32.205
<i>You're embracing the mess.</i>

28:32.206 --> 28:35.309
<i>And you've written
an Incredible Insightful,</i>

28:35.310 --> 28:39.379
hilarious,
controversial manifesto.

28:39.380 --> 28:42.383
Just give us a shot. It has
bestseller written all over it.

28:42.384 --> 28:45.247
We promise we
won't let you down.

28:46.688 --> 28:47.887
So you've read it.

28:47.888 --> 28:51.152
Oh. I live it.
Love it. Every day.

28:52.059 --> 28:54.826
Let me think about it.

28:54.827 --> 28:57.398
<i>Hey, I'm startling a new
birthing class tomorrow.</i>

28:57.399 --> 28:59.031
<i>Maybe Thea could
come with me.</i>

28:59.032 --> 29:00.399
She'll be there.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.135
And bring your partner.

29:02.136 --> 29:05.370
Her fiancée. Miles, right?

29:05.371 --> 29:08.472
Yeah. Could you excuse
me for a second?

29:08.473 --> 29:10.667
<i>Yes.</i>

29:16.849 --> 29:19.544
Vodka. Straight up.

29:24.256 --> 29:26.918
Thanks.

29:34.098 --> 29:35.764
you okay?

29:35.765 --> 29:38.169
I just set the world
record for bullshitting.

29:38.170 --> 29:39.770
What happened?

29:39.771 --> 29:43.262
Long story. I can't
handle doing it again.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.074
A promotion?

29:45.075 --> 29:47.445
you are the new
Associate Editor

29:47.446 --> 29:49.279
of our brand
new Family division.

29:49.280 --> 29:51.014
Family division?

29:51.015 --> 29:53.950
Susie called. She wants to
give us a shot, thanks to you.

29:53.951 --> 29:56.421
Now, Susie’s book will
launch our new division.

29:56.422 --> 29:59.389
It's a perfect opportunity
to capture a new demographic

29:59.390 --> 30:01.658
<i>and help the company
to grow vertically...</i>

30:01.659 --> 30:03.292
Nick.

30:03.293 --> 30:06.061
Look, there's something
I need to tell you.

30:06.062 --> 30:07.598
This whole thing
is a big lie.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.966
<i>I feel terrible,
but I'm not really...</i>

30:09.967 --> 30:11.767
An editor?

30:11.768 --> 30:14.202
I know, I'm the one
who forced you to lie.

30:14.203 --> 30:18.643
<i>Which as a rule Isn't great but what's not
a lie is that you did really good today.</i>

30:18.644 --> 30:20.743
There's so many
people more qualified.

30:20.744 --> 30:23.812
So many people in ways
you don't even know.

30:23.813 --> 30:28.283
Thea. To be a good editor all you
need is a, a feel for the material

30:28.284 --> 30:30.953
It's what my father had
when he started this company

30:30.954 --> 30:32.855
<i>and It's
what you have.</i>

30:32.856 --> 30:36.391
You're living through the
thrills of starting a family.

30:36.392 --> 30:38.795
What about Kristen?
She's pregnant.

30:38.796 --> 30:42.163
<i>Obviously I am too, but
she's, she's really pregnant.</i>

30:42.164 --> 30:46.668
First of all, Kristen's a lawyer
without a creative bone in her body.

30:46.669 --> 30:51.338
<i>And then there's the Indisputable
fact that she's a complete weirdo.</i>

30:51.339 --> 30:55.474
Oh. Look, Nick,
I mean, I see your point.

30:55.475 --> 30:57.745
<i>I do. And I wanna help.</i>

30:57.746 --> 31:00.747
But I just, I can't.

31:00.748 --> 31:02.849
I'm not your accountant.

31:02.850 --> 31:05.217
But the other thing
you should know is that

31:05.218 --> 31:09.058
associate editors make a lot
more money than secretaries.

31:09.059 --> 31:10.224
A lot?

31:10.225 --> 31:11.926
Let's just say,

31:11.927 --> 31:14.195
you'll have your own
secretary and office.

31:14.196 --> 31:17.197
<i>So are you my new
associate editor?</i>

31:17.198 --> 31:20.722
I guess I am.

31:22.904 --> 31:26.104
"War Stories From the Pregnancy
Front" by Susie Cavendish.

31:26.105 --> 31:29.142
you loved it,
you live it.

31:29.143 --> 31:30.810
you should
probably read it.

31:30.811 --> 31:33.546
I do, I agree with
what you're saying.

31:33.547 --> 31:36.414
If you have your colon
health you do have everything.

31:36.415 --> 31:40.318
But, I do, I thought it interesting
when you said we were going wrong

31:40.319 --> 31:46.123
<i>and we should be sort of on the seat like
a gargoyle as opposed to just sitting.</i>

31:46.124 --> 31:49.196
Not now, Miles.

31:49.197 --> 31:53.164
Don't you know enough about
being fake pregnant already?

31:53.165 --> 31:56.734
How can this be this
big of a deal?

31:56.735 --> 32:00.473
I mean, come on, you do the
nasty, you're knocked up,

32:00.474 --> 32:04.442
you inflate and then, uh, eight,
nine months? N nine months later

32:04.443 --> 32:08.680
you shoot that puppy out. I mean, how
can there be 8 million books about this?

32:08.681 --> 32:10.848
Just promise me
you won't write one.

32:10.849 --> 32:14.318
Okay. If you promise you're
still on birth control.

32:14.319 --> 32:16.185
Believe me, I am.

32:16.186 --> 32:17.453
Oh, yeah?

32:17.454 --> 32:18.557
Uh-huh.

32:18.558 --> 32:19.725
Excellent.

32:44.148 --> 32:45.515
N ice new digs, huh?

32:45.516 --> 32:46.648
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:46.649 --> 32:48.182
So, what did you think?

32:48.183 --> 32:49.452
About what?

32:49.453 --> 32:52.284
Uh, Susie’s book.
Any thoughts?

32:52.923 --> 32:55.692
Oh, yeah, it was great.

32:55.693 --> 32:57.591
What do you think?

32:57.592 --> 33:00.296
How much did
you actually read?

33:00.297 --> 33:02.698
The first two chapters.

33:02.699 --> 33:06.400
But I'm gonna finish the rest of it
today. I just got a little distracted.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.169
Nick, please,
let me explain.

33:08.170 --> 33:10.306
Thanks for your thoughts.

33:10.307 --> 33:15.378
you have
shelves. And a door.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.082
Congratulations, Thea.

33:20.083 --> 33:23.106
Thank you, Greg.

33:25.319 --> 33:28.688
you really think you can get to
the top by playing games, don't ya?

33:28.689 --> 33:32.060
<i>I know what you're up to, Thea.
And I think that it stinks.</i>

33:32.061 --> 33:34.595
H m.

33:34.596 --> 33:38.464
Really? Do you think that it stinks that
I want to hire you to be my Assistant?

33:38.465 --> 33:40.469
Really?

33:40.470 --> 33:43.904
<i>you'll start first thing Monday
after I put the paperwork through.</i>

33:43.905 --> 33:47.673
Oh, wow, Thea. Thea, thank you so
much. I, I could kiss you right now.

33:47.674 --> 33:49.176
you don't have
to do that.

33:49.177 --> 33:50.578
I'll see you later, boss.

33:50.579 --> 33:52.644
Look at you,
Little Miss Executive.

33:52.645 --> 33:55.415
Hardly. I don't even really
know what I'm doing here.

33:55.416 --> 33:58.050
I didn't finish the
manuscript last night and Nick

33:58.051 --> 34:00.487
just asked for my opinion
and I didn't have one.

34:00.488 --> 34:07.585
you might wanna get one. This is your
ticket out of the secretarial pool.

34:20.841 --> 34:23.942
<i>If your last name Is
O'Keeffe, why do you look Jewish?</i>

34:23.943 --> 34:28.012
<i>Well, It's true.
you don't look Irish.</i>

34:45.098 --> 34:47.462
Steinwald Publishing.

34:55.274 --> 34:58.808
So O'Keeffe got a new girlfriend.
He's robbing the cradle.

34:58.809 --> 35:01.403
She's 95.

35:04.215 --> 35:06.738
Did you hear me?

35:09.085 --> 35:11.188
<i>I loved it.
It was funny and smart</i>

35:11.189 --> 35:13.723
and you don't even have
to be pregnant to enjoy it.

35:13.724 --> 35:16.191
I'm guessing about that
because I am pregnant.

35:16.192 --> 35:18.126
I enjoyed it and I'm
not pregnant.

35:18.127 --> 35:21.600
I was thinking, you could organize
the chapters like a pregnancy.

35:21.601 --> 35:24.367
you know, group each
woman's stories by trimester.

35:24.402 --> 35:27.869
So, so the book would start with
stories about the awkward moments

35:27.870 --> 35:30.941
when everyone thinks you've
been eating too many cupcakes.

35:30.942 --> 35:33.075
<i>Exactly. And then
the second trimester.</i>

35:33.076 --> 35:36.478
Like Sally's story when she threw
up in her purse at her kid's play.

35:36.479 --> 35:40.281
<i>Nick, I'm sorry I didn’t finish the
book last night. It won't happen again.</i>

35:40.282 --> 35:42.118
I'm glad you like it.

35:42.119 --> 35:45.486
We've got our work cut out for us.
It'll be in bookstores in 6 weeks.

35:45.487 --> 35:47.193
I'd like to see your notes,

35:47.194 --> 35:50.894
but Susie’s class starts in
20 minutes so you should go.

35:50.895 --> 35:56.264
I totally forgot. The thing is,
Miles is going out of town for work.

35:56.265 --> 35:57.432
That's too bad.

35:57.433 --> 35:59.433
Do you think
I could reschedule?

35:59.434 --> 36:03.838
Now it's time for partner
relaxation techniques

36:03.839 --> 36:05.940
for when your
special marathon begins.

36:05.941 --> 36:09.409
So, partners, I want you to
move behind your marathoners...

36:09.410 --> 36:11.546
<i>with your legs
open In a big V.</i>

36:11.547 --> 36:14.248
<i>Hm. Welcome home.</i>

36:14.249 --> 36:19.018
<i>Now, take this opportunity to
stroke your wives or girlfriends.</i>

36:19.019 --> 36:21.154
Stroke it out.

36:21.155 --> 36:24.423
<i>Now why don't you whisper
something special to her, okay?</i>

36:24.424 --> 36:27.728
<i>Something that only you two would
share In this private moment.</i>

36:27.729 --> 36:30.563
It could be funny,
it could be naughty.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.934
I'm not listening.

36:33.935 --> 36:36.303
Let that relaxation
wash over you.

36:36.304 --> 36:37.905
I am so sorry
about this.

36:37.906 --> 36:40.406
It's, you know, you don't
have to stroke my hair.

36:40.407 --> 36:42.143
Okay, I'm sorry.

36:42.144 --> 36:44.343
Uh, you know, you can
lean back if you want.

36:44.344 --> 36:46.379
I, I can tell you're
kind of straining.

36:46.380 --> 36:47.579
I am.

36:47.580 --> 36:50.014
Great. Now that
we're all relaxed,

36:50.015 --> 36:52.652
let's try some
birthing positions, okay?

36:52.653 --> 36:55.955
Mary? Could I borrow
your partner for just a sec?

36:55.956 --> 36:58.423
<i>I promise I'll give
him back. Maybe.</i>

36:58.424 --> 37:00.858
I'm just kidding. Come
here, cutie. All right.

37:00.859 --> 37:05.631
<i>I want you to get on all fours with
your palms firmly placed to the ground</i>

37:05.632 --> 37:10.167
and then we're gonna rock back.
We're gonna rock back into it. Oh.

37:10.168 --> 37:12.538
<i>Feel that womb open up.</i>

37:12.539 --> 37:16.174
It feels familiar, right? This is
how we got ourselves into this mess.

37:16.175 --> 37:20.377
<i>For some of us, not all of
us. The position’s not for everybody.</i>

37:20.378 --> 37:25.382
Partners, I want you to
envelope your marathoner, okay?

37:25.383 --> 37:28.787
And just get in a deep
stretch here around the belly

37:28.788 --> 37:33.125
<i>keep moving back and forth, right?
Get your hands on the tummy back there.</i>

37:33.126 --> 37:36.225
<i>And keep pushing In. Keep
pushing In and envelope.</i>

37:36.226 --> 37:38.828
<i>Get right on top of there.
Feel that, feel... Lop.</i>

37:38.829 --> 37:40.228
Man down, okay.

37:40.229 --> 37:41.564
It's okay.

37:41.565 --> 37:44.502
Just hop back on.
No mistakes here.

37:44.503 --> 37:50.373
<i>Okay. All right. Finish up when
you feel done. I need a few more.</i>

37:50.374 --> 37:52.843
If you'll indulge
me Mary, thank you.

37:52.844 --> 37:56.313
<i>Okay, and just keep the
rocking. Never stop rocking.</i>

37:56.314 --> 38:01.849
Oh! Yes. Give it to me,
Rob, we're doing it now.

38:01.850 --> 38:05.787
Oh! Oh!

38:05.788 --> 38:09.192
<i>Okay.
And we're done.</i>

38:09.193 --> 38:12.159
Wonderful, thank you.
This guy's good, right?

38:12.160 --> 38:14.831
<i>I'm gonna borrow
you for another class.</i>

38:14.832 --> 38:19.359
Or after class.
I'm kidding.

38:22.305 --> 38:23.607
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

38:23.608 --> 38:26.708
That was great. Thanks a lot.

38:26.709 --> 38:27.976
Bye.

38:27.977 --> 38:29.944
Wow. That was up there

38:29.945 --> 38:33.449
as one of the most
embarrassing moments of my life.

38:33.450 --> 38:36.318
Hey, here, let me
get you something.

38:36.319 --> 38:40.445
No, no, it's the least I can
do after nearly paraly Xing you.

38:42.959 --> 38:45.018
<i>HI.</i>

38:47.662 --> 38:49.196
Thanks.

38:49.197 --> 38:51.797
Did you always work
in the family business?

38:51.798 --> 38:57.304
Uh, I wanted to be a writer. But
I was scared I might be a total hack

38:57.305 --> 38:59.540
so I got an accounting
degree.

38:59.541 --> 39:02.909
<i>I figured I'd make a living doing
that while I finished my book...</i>

39:02.910 --> 39:05.546
but kind of been stuck in
the middle for a few years.

39:05.547 --> 39:07.447
What do you wanna
be when you grow up?

39:07.448 --> 39:10.351
Well, in college I played
in a badass metal band.

39:10.352 --> 39:12.485
Really?
You're a badass?

39:12.486 --> 39:14.955
A little bit, kind of.

39:14.956 --> 39:18.724
Fascinating. A little
terrifying but fascinating.

39:18.725 --> 39:22.928
So is that what you did in
college, badass metal band studies?

39:22.929 --> 39:25.064
No, I didn't
finish college.

39:25.065 --> 39:28.167
Oh, why not? Too boring?
Not Joan Jett enough for you?

39:28.168 --> 39:33.673
No. U m, I loved college. It's just my
parents passed away in a car accident,

39:33.674 --> 39:37.043
so I had to leave to take
care of my little sister.

39:37.044 --> 39:39.345
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have said anything.

39:39.346 --> 39:42.279
Oh, n... no. I... I'm
glad you told me.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.150
I'm just so sorry
that happened.

39:45.151 --> 39:47.584
Thanks.

39:48.621 --> 39:50.556
So is your sister
a badass like you?

39:50.557 --> 39:52.722
No, she's more
of a smart ass.

39:52.723 --> 39:56.319
Here.

39:57.663 --> 40:00.798
Hey, you know, uh, Susie’s
having a pool party this weekend.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.599
you should come.
And bring Miles.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.203
Pool party?

40:04.204 --> 40:06.636
Yeah. I promise, I won't
be wearing a Speedo.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.152
Nice look!

40:23.153 --> 40:26.058
Do we have a secret steam
room you never told me about?

40:26.059 --> 40:27.592
No, I'm going
to a pool party.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.126
Ah. Well, good thing
you've got that towel on now.

40:30.127 --> 40:33.228
Wouldn't wanna leave that 'til
when you actually get there.

40:33.229 --> 40:36.233
Enough of the sass, smarty
pants. What are you doing here?

40:36.234 --> 40:37.966
Tennis ended early.

40:37.967 --> 40:40.035
What's the bag for?

40:40.036 --> 40:41.637
Nothing.

40:41.638 --> 40:44.305
Come on, you can
do better than that.

40:44.306 --> 40:45.910
At least I'm wearing pants.

40:45.911 --> 40:47.743
Pants? you call
those pants?

40:47.744 --> 40:49.945
They're shorts.

40:49.946 --> 40:54.785
All right, bye. Don't
call if you need me.

40:58.053 --> 41:02.156
Okay, you really have to act
like you're the father, okay?

41:02.157 --> 41:03.491
Yeah.

41:03.492 --> 41:05.628
You're the father.
It's serious.

41:05.629 --> 41:06.895
Oh, come on.

41:06.896 --> 41:08.830
you have to appear
to be responsible.

41:08.831 --> 41:10.865
Are you kidding me?
I'm totally psyched.

41:10.866 --> 41:14.101
I thought about this. Everyone's
gonna think I'm a super-stud

41:14.102 --> 41:16.070
for knocking up a
hot chick like you.

41:16.071 --> 41:19.140
Okay, so, that's an example
of something you wouldn't say.

41:19.141 --> 41:22.609
<i>Baby. Well, I think you're
beautiful even with your...</i>

41:22.610 --> 41:24.837
Thank you.

41:30.419 --> 41:32.020
<i>Hey.</i>

41:32.021 --> 41:33.552
How are you?

41:33.553 --> 41:36.824
Nick, this is my fiancé, Miles.
Miles, this is Nick.

41:36.825 --> 41:39.793
Congratulations.
you must be so excited.

41:39.794 --> 41:43.562
Oh, it's, I just can't wait for
the little guy to pop out.

41:43.563 --> 41:44.830
Oh, you're
having a boy.

41:44.831 --> 41:45.933
Yeah.

41:45.934 --> 41:47.302
We, uh, we
just found out.

41:47.303 --> 41:48.868
And do you
have a name yet?

41:48.869 --> 41:50.569
<i>Now, see,
I didn't think any...</i>

41:50.570 --> 41:51.736
Hey.

41:51.737 --> 41:53.737
Garth, this is
my fiancé, Miles.

41:53.738 --> 41:56.343
Miles, Garth. He's an
editor at the company.

41:56.344 --> 41:57.812
You're a lucky guy, huh?

41:57.813 --> 42:02.515
Yes, I am. you look pretty
lucky your self there.

42:02.516 --> 42:05.016
I'm gonna go inside
and say hi to Susie.

42:05.017 --> 42:06.620
Oh, yeah,
hold up, babe.

42:06.621 --> 42:09.122
I'm taking a dip. It's
blazing here. Babes.

42:09.123 --> 42:10.222
Yeah?

42:10.223 --> 42:11.524
Right there.

42:11.525 --> 42:13.059
Anybody care to join?

42:13.060 --> 42:14.224
I will. Let's go in.

42:14.225 --> 42:15.661
That's what
I like to hear.

42:15.662 --> 42:17.263
I don't wanna
get my chain wet.

42:17.264 --> 42:20.165
Listen, I have two friends
that I want you to meet.

42:20.166 --> 42:23.834
They're both writers and they're
actually looking for a new publisher,

42:23.835 --> 42:25.703
so I think they'll
really like you.

42:25.704 --> 42:27.039
Really?

42:27.040 --> 42:28.906
you and Nick
make such a good team.

42:28.907 --> 42:31.135
Thank you.

42:37.417 --> 42:40.984
Hey, guys. I want you
to meet Audrey Gold...

42:40.985 --> 42:44.788
and Dr. Terry Barnacle. Terry
wrote the Barnacle Baby Book,

42:44.789 --> 42:46.925
- which is like the bible...
- Oh, no...

42:46.926 --> 42:50.427
I won't even touch that. I don't wanna
be accused of having a God complex.

42:50.428 --> 42:53.230
And Audrey just finished
a book on single parenting...

42:53.231 --> 42:57.635
and I hear from reliable sources that
she's not very happy at Boyle Donner.

42:57.636 --> 43:01.570
Oh, well we would love
to meet with you guys.

43:02.540 --> 43:06.140
Yeah, Nick and Thea just started
a parenting division at Steinwald.

43:06.141 --> 43:08.578
Hmm. you have
the most unique shape.

43:08.579 --> 43:13.083
If you don't mind me asking, you
don't have a distended uterus, do you?

43:13.084 --> 43:17.388
Uh, no, no, I...
I don't think so.

43:17.389 --> 43:19.956
Well, who's your OB?

43:19.957 --> 43:24.292
Dr. Drake Barysinwitx.

43:24.293 --> 43:27.498
you mean Hans?
Frogenberry Schoenewitx?

43:27.499 --> 43:30.132
I thought he moved
back to Vienna.

43:31.401 --> 43:33.000
Oh!

43:33.001 --> 43:36.637
My bad. I just, I was trying
to, totally going for her.

43:36.638 --> 43:38.141
Very funny, Miles.

43:38.142 --> 43:42.109
Hey. you should... uh, you
should totally come in.

43:42.110 --> 43:44.111
We're having
such a good time in there.

43:44.112 --> 43:46.113
I don't feel like
swimming right now.

43:46.114 --> 43:48.118
Come on.
It's so nice in there.

43:48.119 --> 43:51.052
<i>No one cares that you're fat.
Kids, tell her to come in.</i>

43:51.053 --> 43:54.389
Come in. Come in. Come in.

43:54.390 --> 43:56.256
<i>It's okay.</i>

43:56.257 --> 43:58.560
you don't want to
disappoint the children.

43:58.561 --> 43:59.660
Woo!

43:59.661 --> 44:00.995
Shit.

44:03.698 --> 44:04.964
What is that?

44:04.965 --> 44:06.666
Oh!

44:06.667 --> 44:07.969
<i>Oh...</i>

44:10.304 --> 44:12.601
<i>That's not cool.</i>

44:18.814 --> 44:20.779
<i>It was so humiliating.</i>

44:20.780 --> 44:24.117
On the way home I told him to drop
me off and never speak to me again.

44:24.118 --> 44:27.522
Good. I always thought Miles
was a bit of a numb nut anyway.

44:27.523 --> 44:31.491
I'm just so embarrassed that N
nick thinks he's the father of my child.

44:31.492 --> 44:33.193
Who cares
what Nick thinks?

44:33.194 --> 44:35.060
He's just the first
person in years

44:35.061 --> 44:38.364
that thinks I'm capable of doing
more than just pouring coffee.

44:38.365 --> 44:40.667
What do you think he'll
say when he finds out

44:40.668 --> 44:44.871
your baby is a piece of polyurethane
foam we swiped off a mannequin?

44:44.872 --> 44:47.739
He's actually kinda cute
though, don't you think?

44:47.740 --> 44:49.074
Who?

44:49.075 --> 44:50.842
U m, Nick.

44:50.843 --> 44:52.678
U m, no.

44:52.679 --> 44:54.246
Cigarette?

44:54.247 --> 44:56.746
No, I probably shouldn't.

44:59.487 --> 45:03.889
Okay, uh, to recap, uh

45:03.890 --> 45:07.258
only one of you would even
bother to look at the book.

45:07.259 --> 45:11.863
<i>And the rest of you wouldn't
buy it with a gun to your head...</i>

45:11.864 --> 45:15.331
<i>which can't
be good for sales.</i>

45:18.037 --> 45:21.172
Can any of you tell me why
the cover doesn't speak to you?

45:21.173 --> 45:25.542
<i>Maybe comparing pregnancy to a
battle Is, uh, putting you off.</i>

45:25.543 --> 45:26.976
Yes.

45:26.977 --> 45:29.247
I can't stay for the
rest of the focus group.

45:29.248 --> 45:31.949
Can I still
get my check?

45:31.950 --> 45:34.975
Just stop by reception.

45:39.525 --> 45:42.685
<i>Okay. Uh, one down.</i>

45:44.629 --> 45:47.463
Maybe we should forget what's
on the cover for a second.

45:47.464 --> 45:50.134
<i>What makes this book great
is that It's a collection</i>

45:50.135 --> 45:53.802
of real stories for real women talking
about how it feels to be pregnant.

45:53.803 --> 45:57.135
So let's talk about some
of us feel right now.

45:57.541 --> 45:58.976
I feel like crap.

45:58.977 --> 46:02.110
That's good. I mean,
that's bad. But keep going.

46:02.111 --> 46:06.146
How come no one talks about
how much pregnancy sucks!

46:06.147 --> 46:08.383
Oh, there's no
glow in my house.

46:08.384 --> 46:11.420
Okay, so what I'm hearing is
that you're all so over it.

46:11.421 --> 46:13.222
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:13.223 --> 46:16.025
<i>Hello, I'm Orca the Whale.
Like, what's up with that?</i>

46:16.026 --> 46:18.192
<i>I know, they're not
even bloated at all.</i>

46:18.193 --> 46:21.424
<i>Thea, your
sister’s at reception.</i>

46:25.268 --> 46:27.234
Hey, what are
you doing here?

46:27.235 --> 46:31.105
you forgot to sign the release for my
trip to Lake Arrowhead. It's due today.

46:31.106 --> 46:35.043
Thea, aren't you going to
introduce me to your sister?

46:35.044 --> 46:38.077
Oh, Nick, Emma.
Emma, Nick.

46:38.078 --> 46:40.945
She's in a real rush.
She has to go.

46:41.450 --> 46:46.119
Okay, well, this has been
fun. It's been fun.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.354
What is that?

46:47.355 --> 46:49.224
Just because you
don't like my dress

46:49.225 --> 46:50.926
doesn't mean you
have to be rude.

46:50.927 --> 46:52.859
Move. I'll
tell you outside.

46:52.860 --> 46:54.194
What's wrong with you?

46:54.195 --> 46:56.329
I'm a big fat liar,
but Jerry was firing me

46:56.330 --> 46:59.025
I had to come up
with something.

47:00.002 --> 47:02.603
you are one sandwich shy
of a picnic, you know that?

47:02.604 --> 47:04.870
You're crazy. What
are you thinking?

47:04.871 --> 47:08.640
you might be interested to
know that I got a promotion and a raise.

47:08.641 --> 47:11.312
I can't believe we're
actually related.

47:11.313 --> 47:13.180
As soon as I can
I'm gonna come clean.

47:13.181 --> 47:16.282
Things are complicated.
The company depends on me.

47:16.283 --> 47:20.519
I have heard enough.
I am out of here.

47:28.728 --> 47:29.863
Morning, Thea.

47:29.864 --> 47:31.498
Last month's
and this month's.

47:31.499 --> 47:34.055
Wow, early.
That's a first.

47:35.334 --> 47:37.069
I've got
something for you.

47:37.070 --> 47:38.937
Oh, you made these?

47:38.938 --> 47:40.273
Yes.

47:40.274 --> 47:43.440
I went with marigold
because it's neutral.

47:43.441 --> 47:46.102
Thank you.

47:48.212 --> 47:49.480
Hey.

47:49.481 --> 47:52.716
Hey. Okay, not that
you're interested,

47:52.717 --> 47:55.786
but the word is that Nick's
divorce is finalized this week.

47:55.787 --> 47:57.054
Garth told me.

47:57.055 --> 47:58.722
Garth told you?

47:58.723 --> 48:01.394
I've been hanging out
with him, Miss Busy.

48:01.395 --> 48:04.729
I took the liberty of picking
you up a calcium-enriched smoothie

48:04.730 --> 48:08.197
and a bran muffin. I figured you
might be getting a little backed up.

48:08.198 --> 48:09.264
Thanks, Greg.

48:09.265 --> 48:11.435
You're welcome.
Excuse me.

48:11.436 --> 48:14.004
Greg's worried about
you being backed up?

48:14.005 --> 48:16.874
Constipation is a common
problem for pregnant women.

48:16.875 --> 48:19.074
Ach.

48:19.075 --> 48:22.746
Well... lucky for you
you're not actually pregnant.

48:22.747 --> 48:24.747
Or do you even
know that anymore?

48:24.748 --> 48:26.649
Of course I know that.
Obviously.

48:26.650 --> 48:28.650
<i>Hi.</i>

48:28.651 --> 48:29.951
- Hi.
- Sorry to interrupt.

48:29.952 --> 48:34.188
I wanted to get you a little
something, I ordered it off of eBay.

48:35.059 --> 48:38.026
<i>It's an armadillo foot for,
for when you're In labor.</i>

48:38.027 --> 48:40.328
It, it wards
off the evil eye.

48:40.329 --> 48:42.800
Thank you so much, Carl.
That's so sweet of you.

48:42.801 --> 48:45.368
I'll keep it with
me the whole time.

48:45.369 --> 48:49.737
Oh-kay. I know I told you to go
along with this for a few weeks,

48:49.738 --> 48:51.774
but you're starting
to freak me out.

48:51.775 --> 48:53.743
Things are going
really well for me.

48:53.744 --> 48:56.778
It's not because of the
stomach. you're doing good work.

48:56.779 --> 48:59.345
<i>The only thing you're
doing bad is walking around</i>

48:59.346 --> 49:01.883
<i>with a load of bullshit
strapped to your stomach.</i>

49:01.884 --> 49:03.151
<i>Nick. Nick.</i>

49:03.152 --> 49:04.451
Nick.

49:04.452 --> 49:05.920
What's up?

49:05.921 --> 49:08.155
you won't believe who
left me a voicemail.

49:08.156 --> 49:10.156
An Associate
producer from the Vista.

49:10.157 --> 49:11.360
No way.

49:11.361 --> 49:12.829
She read the book,
loves it,

49:12.830 --> 49:14.929
<i>with Claire’s
approval, we'll be In.</i>

49:14.930 --> 49:16.997
That would be
the greatest thing ever.

49:16.998 --> 49:18.866
Oh!

49:18.867 --> 49:20.134
Oh.

49:20.135 --> 49:23.638
Sorry. I... I'm a bit
of a closet hugger.

49:23.639 --> 49:25.271
It won't happen again.

49:25.272 --> 49:26.840
That's, that's okay.

49:26.841 --> 49:28.608
<i>Nick, I got Jerry for you.</i>

49:28.609 --> 49:31.010
Oh. Uh, put
him through.

49:31.011 --> 49:32.980
How you holding
down the fort, Nicky?

49:32.981 --> 49:35.148
Good, Everything's
going great.

49:35.149 --> 49:36.783
<i>Working on a little project.</i>

49:36.784 --> 49:39.084
you haven't done
anything stupid, have you?

49:39.085 --> 49:40.486
<i>No, of course not.</i>

49:40.487 --> 49:43.491
You're doing
great, sweetie.

49:45.159 --> 49:49.461
Do me a favor, Nick. No little
projects. Don't do anything.

49:49.462 --> 49:54.233
<i>Don't touch anything. If you
need a project, try match. om.</i>

49:54.234 --> 49:56.703
It's been awhile since
you've seen any action.

49:56.704 --> 50:00.193
Okay, Jerry. I'll talk
to you later. Thank you.

50:00.939 --> 50:02.675
It really hasn't
been that long.

50:02.676 --> 50:04.376
I'm, I'm sure.

50:04.377 --> 50:07.446
Um, okay. I got a lotta work
to do. So, I'm gonna go do it.

50:07.447 --> 50:10.148
Okay. Bye.

50:15.287 --> 50:17.221
So the book comes
out in three weeks.

50:17.222 --> 50:20.849
That, that gives us
plenty of time for publicity.

50:25.932 --> 50:27.799
I hope you don't mind.

50:27.800 --> 50:31.233
I just couldn't
take it anymore.

50:34.475 --> 50:36.141
Oh, wow.

50:36.142 --> 50:37.542
I can see!

50:39.378 --> 50:42.213
God. I don't know if you know
this, but you're pregnant.

50:42.214 --> 50:45.481
your sense of humor really takes
a dive after nine o'clock, huh?

50:45.482 --> 50:46.917
Is it after nine?

50:46.918 --> 50:48.351
Yeah.

50:48.352 --> 50:50.820
Oh, my God, I'm slave-driving
a pregnant woman.

50:50.821 --> 50:52.523
No, not at all,
I wanna be here.

50:52.524 --> 50:55.558
I do, I feel I'm
making up for lost time.

50:55.559 --> 50:58.260
And I'm really grateful
you've given me this shot.

50:58.261 --> 51:00.363
So, thanks.

51:00.364 --> 51:02.662
It's my pleasure.

51:06.770 --> 51:08.838
You should be at
home with your fiancé.

51:08.839 --> 51:12.137
Right. My fiancé.

51:15.445 --> 51:17.313
I'm taking you home.

51:17.614 --> 51:21.549
But... you promise to have
ridiculously high expectations

51:21.550 --> 51:22.751
of me in the morning.

51:23.820 --> 51:25.321
Thank you.

51:25.322 --> 51:27.623
Well, here, no, no.

51:27.624 --> 51:29.058
Okay.

52:17.039 --> 52:18.138
Is this your first?

52:18.139 --> 52:20.741
Yeah. I can't wait.
And you?

52:20.742 --> 52:22.866
It's mine, too.

52:24.145 --> 52:26.668
Would you
sign this, please?

52:31.851 --> 52:33.451
<i>Oh, that's amazing.</i>

52:33.452 --> 52:37.088
What about
Thea? Thea?

52:37.089 --> 52:38.757
Absolutely, you.

52:38.758 --> 52:39.891
No, no, no.

52:39.892 --> 52:42.227
Yes.

52:42.228 --> 52:43.997
No, I stay
behind the camera.

52:43.998 --> 52:45.932
you, over here
right now.

52:45.933 --> 52:48.797
<i>Come on, give it a shot.</i>

52:50.136 --> 52:51.269
Oh, yeah.

52:51.270 --> 52:52.436
Work it.

52:52.437 --> 52:53.605
Nick.

52:53.606 --> 52:55.474
<i>Make love to the...</i>

52:55.475 --> 52:59.204
Sorry. I know you don't
actually say that. I'm sorry.

53:02.013 --> 53:04.683
Thanks for coming here with me.
I had such a craving.

53:04.684 --> 53:06.751
Are you kidding me?
I love mud slide pie.

53:06.752 --> 53:09.220
I think we could use a
little more whipped cream.

53:09.221 --> 53:11.323
Oh, did I tell you we
signed Barnacle?

53:11.324 --> 53:13.088
Thanks for hooking
us up with him.

53:13.089 --> 53:15.826
My pleasure. Oh, I may
have some good news.

53:15.827 --> 53:19.163
I may have gotten us two
spots in Sunshine Daycare.

53:19.164 --> 53:22.364
Great. Thanks. I haven't
even thought about daycare.

53:22.365 --> 53:25.203
I don't know how you do it,
with your kid, your pregnancy

53:25.204 --> 53:28.339
and your job. I can't even take
care of my little sister, Emma.

53:28.340 --> 53:30.574
I wish my mother left
me user instructions.

53:30.575 --> 53:33.009
Well, there are no
hard and fast rules.

53:33.010 --> 53:34.813
you just have to go
with your gut.

53:34.814 --> 53:38.047
Yeah, well I certainly have no
shortage of gut at the moment.

53:38.048 --> 53:41.683
Well, when all else
fails, sugar and shopping.

53:41.684 --> 53:44.675
Very persuasive.

53:57.260 --> 53:58.568
- Hi.
- Hi...

53:58.569 --> 53:59.835
is Emma here?

53:59.836 --> 54:03.070
Oh, hi, Emma. Can you
babysit tomorrow night?

54:03.071 --> 54:05.074
Oh, I can't,
Donna. Sorry.

54:05.075 --> 54:07.476
<i>I have to study
with my friend Chloe.</i>

54:07.477 --> 54:10.445
Um, I can do it.

54:10.446 --> 54:12.214
you know, good practice.

54:12.215 --> 54:15.585
That's right. Oh, God.
Thea, you are the best.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.160
- Tomorrow night at eight?
- Yeah.

54:17.161 --> 54:19.813
- Great. Bye.
- Bye.

54:22.691 --> 54:26.495
I don't even know who you are right
now, but you're definitely not the best.

54:26.496 --> 54:30.530
Do you wanna make cupcakes and then
maybe go shopping at Forever Twenty-One?

54:30.531 --> 54:35.470
No. Actually I'd rather scrub
myself down with a pineapple

54:35.471 --> 54:38.199
than do that.

54:39.608 --> 54:41.642
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

54:41.643 --> 54:47.449
This was Dan's idea. He was all, like,
let's have a baby. It'll be so cute.

54:47.450 --> 54:49.817
<i>you know? I was,
like really?</i>

54:49.818 --> 54:53.886
Really? Well, let's strap 50
pounds of cement to your torso...

54:53.887 --> 54:57.390
and see how fun it is then.
you know, I just...

54:57.391 --> 55:00.560
Yeah. I know.
I understand.

55:00.561 --> 55:03.428
I just need a drink.
Or some weed.

55:03.429 --> 55:05.163
I know it's scary.

55:05.164 --> 55:09.468
I mean, the fact that we're gonna
have these tiny fragile humans

55:09.469 --> 55:12.872
totally dependent on us. It's
kind of freaking me out, too.

55:12.873 --> 55:14.206
Really?

55:14.207 --> 55:15.574
Yeah.

55:15.575 --> 55:17.978
'Cause, Thea, you just,
you seem so together.

55:17.979 --> 55:19.511
<i>Oh, hl.</i>

55:19.512 --> 55:20.979
We need to talk.

55:20.980 --> 55:22.747
What happened?

55:22.748 --> 55:25.613
Okay, thanks
for listening.

55:29.489 --> 55:31.089
Uh...

55:31.090 --> 55:33.124
I... uh,

55:33.125 --> 55:35.492
<i>I kinda got into an
altercation with Miles.</i>

55:35.493 --> 55:37.029
What're you talking about?

55:37.030 --> 55:39.698
He was kissing another woman.
So I confronted him.

55:39.699 --> 55:42.934
And he told me... he told me
he's not the father.

55:42.935 --> 55:44.397
<i>So I punched him.</i>

55:44.398 --> 55:45.801
- You what?
- I punched him.

55:45.802 --> 55:48.307
I couldn't help it...
just... it came over me.

55:48.807 --> 55:51.676
You deserve better than that,
Thea, a... a lot better.

55:51.677 --> 55:54.978
Nick, Miles is not the father.

55:54.979 --> 55:56.849
<i>He's not even
my boyfriend... anymore.</i>

55:56.850 --> 55:59.182
The truth is,
there is no father.

55:59.183 --> 56:03.054
I mean, there is but it was a one-night
stand and he's outta the picture now.

56:03.055 --> 56:08.159
Thea, there is nothing wrong
with being a single mother.

56:08.160 --> 56:09.391
Okay.

56:11.094 --> 56:13.797
The printer
has a question He's on line one.

56:13.798 --> 56:16.596
Okay.

56:18.002 --> 56:19.635
Oh.

56:19.636 --> 56:21.904
<i>What was that about?
He looks like a maniac.</i>

56:21.905 --> 56:23.439
I just told
Nick the truth.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.241
- How'd he take it?
- Okay...

56:25.242 --> 56:28.079
He doesn't think
I should be with Miles anyway.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.480
Yeah, but what did he
say about the pregnancy?

56:30.481 --> 56:32.849
He didn't say anything
about the pregnancy.

56:32.850 --> 56:34.516
What's there to say?

56:34.517 --> 56:37.686
Thea. We should talk. Do you
want to get a beer after work?

56:37.687 --> 56:41.622
A beer? you know
I can't drink.

56:45.827 --> 56:47.863
Is your stomach growing?

56:47.864 --> 56:50.797
Well, I'm nearly
six months now.

56:56.137 --> 56:57.473
Hi, how are you?

56:57.474 --> 57:00.599
Where's my
sister, Emma?

57:01.443 --> 57:04.111
<i>Hey.</i>

57:04.112 --> 57:06.013
<i>How was practice?</i>

57:06.014 --> 57:07.917
Fine. Same as usual.

57:07.918 --> 57:12.753
Really? That's funny because Coach
Henrietta told me you quit a month ago.

57:12.754 --> 57:16.722
I found this in your backpack,
you've got some explaining to do.

57:16.723 --> 57:19.328
That's dried cilantro.

57:19.329 --> 57:20.461
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

57:20.462 --> 57:23.053
Smell it.

57:24.931 --> 57:27.232
Okay, maybe it is.
But where were you today?

57:27.233 --> 57:30.169
At Jake's,
waiting tables.

57:30.170 --> 57:32.538
You've been
lying for weeks.

57:32.539 --> 57:35.028
Hey, I learn from the best.

57:40.581 --> 57:44.151
Hey... um, your boss is here.

57:44.152 --> 57:45.585
- What?
- Yeah...

57:45.586 --> 57:47.956
maybe he wants to make
cupcakes with you.

57:47.957 --> 57:50.157
Um... can you get my stomach?
It's in my room.

57:50.158 --> 57:54.726
Yeah. But... um,
it'll cost you... 25 bucks.

57:54.727 --> 57:57.560
- 15!
- Sold.

57:57.730 --> 58:00.565
She'll be right with you.
She's just getting dressed.

58:00.566 --> 58:02.555
Okay, thanks.

58:07.504 --> 58:11.243
Does it make you feel weird knowing
she's naked only, like, ten feet away.

58:11.244 --> 58:12.844
Em!

58:12.845 --> 58:14.447
<i>Coming.</i>

58:14.448 --> 58:15.579
Stomach.

58:15.580 --> 58:16.879
No. Pay me.

58:16.880 --> 58:18.950
I'll pay you after.
Give me the stomach.

58:18.951 --> 58:23.250
A promise from Thea? I can't take
that to the bank. Just pay me know.

58:26.690 --> 58:29.761
Thank you.
Here's your fake belly.

58:29.762 --> 58:31.728
Shut up. Get out.

58:33.265 --> 58:34.398
Hello.

58:34.399 --> 58:35.633
Hey.

58:35.634 --> 58:37.600
<i>Okay.</i>

58:37.601 --> 58:39.004
Hey.

58:39.005 --> 58:41.604
<i>Um... I... I just,
I thought I'd stop by, uh...</i>

58:41.605 --> 58:44.606
I wanted to show
you something.

58:44.607 --> 58:49.113
It's our very first complete copy of
the book with cover and everything.

58:49.114 --> 58:52.850
That's, that's great!
And, wow, I'm on the cover.

58:52.851 --> 58:56.351
Oh. And we booked... uh, Tynan's
bookstore for the book launch.

58:56.352 --> 58:57.719
That's awesome.

58:57.720 --> 58:59.958
Well, um, I should
probably get outta here...

58:59.959 --> 59:01.892
and let you
enjoy your Saturday.

59:01.893 --> 59:04.661
Well... um, if you're free
then do you wanna get coffee?

59:04.662 --> 59:06.922
Sure.

59:09.166 --> 59:13.502
I had a dog once. Then Jerry
stole it, took it to college with him.

59:13.503 --> 59:15.070
Oh.

59:15.071 --> 59:18.472
There's something amazing
about having a child.

59:18.473 --> 59:23.878
It makes you feel like a
part of something bigger,

59:23.879 --> 59:29.478
you know, even if it's not real.
Well, for me, that is.

59:30.322 --> 59:34.388
Lydia didn't want children.
And I never questioned it.

59:34.389 --> 59:36.690
But now I,

59:36.691 --> 59:43.653
I realize, I...
I do wanna be a father.

01:00:02.316 --> 01:00:05.920
I've been wanting to do
that for a really long time.

01:00:05.921 --> 01:00:08.287
Actually, I just,
just did that.

01:00:08.288 --> 01:00:09.990
Right.

01:00:09.991 --> 01:00:12.792
We should probably take
things slowly though.

01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:14.327
Absolutely.

01:00:14.328 --> 01:00:17.057
Yeah.

01:00:28.874 --> 01:00:31.277
<i>I have to...
I just realized...</i>

01:00:31.278 --> 01:00:32.911
I have to go.

01:00:32.912 --> 01:00:35.480
<i>There's somewhere...
I have to go somewhere.</i>

01:00:35.481 --> 01:00:36.714
Sure. Okay.

01:00:36.715 --> 01:00:38.649
<i>My sister...
I'll talk to you later.</i>

01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:40.053
Okay.

01:00:57.035 --> 01:00:59.369
Yes, she's due
the sixth of October.

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.040
Alright. Okay.

01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:05.342
That was your friend, Rachel.
And these are for you.

01:01:05.343 --> 01:01:07.311
She saw the book
at Crown Books.

01:01:07.312 --> 01:01:09.746
How come you didn't
tell her you were pregnant?

01:01:09.747 --> 01:01:12.283
I thought I told her.
It must have slipped my mind.

01:01:12.284 --> 01:01:13.949
Pregnancy brain.

01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:17.120
I was planning on waiting a
little longer to start a family.

01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:19.423
Sow my wild oats
a little bit.

01:01:19.424 --> 01:01:22.593
<i>But, I feel like there is
a larger purpose for me.</i>

01:01:22.594 --> 01:01:27.831
Thea, you need someone who
is smart and responsible.

01:01:27.832 --> 01:01:29.432
<i>Oh, God.</i>

01:01:29.433 --> 01:01:33.037
I offer myself to you, mind
and body, heart and soul.

01:01:33.038 --> 01:01:35.572
Let me be your
baby daddy.

01:01:35.573 --> 01:01:39.306
Uh... uh... uh,
that's very generous of you.

01:01:39.307 --> 01:01:43.611
<i>But it's, you know...
that's not gonna ha...</i>

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:46.449
Don't worry about it.
It's a tough decision.

01:01:46.450 --> 01:01:48.416
Thea, can I talk to you?

01:01:48.417 --> 01:01:49.950
Yeah, sure, yes.

01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:51.288
Yes, absolutely.

01:01:51.289 --> 01:01:53.223
If you could let me know before lunch.

01:01:53.224 --> 01:01:55.157
I have a date
I'd have to cancel.

01:01:55.158 --> 01:01:59.524
I don't want to do that if I don't
have to. She's a little older...

01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:02.299
So you're
ready for tonight?

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.365
Yeah. Totally.

01:02:04.366 --> 01:02:07.560
We should clear the air.

01:02:10.104 --> 01:02:12.708
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened.

01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:14.943
<i>And I feel
terrible about it.</i>

01:02:14.944 --> 01:02:16.610
You do?

01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:20.346
<i>I'm your boss and I made...
I made a pass at you.</i>

01:02:20.347 --> 01:02:22.718
Nick, that's not it.
I made a pass at you.

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:24.986
I caught that pass
and I threw it back.

01:02:24.987 --> 01:02:26.086
And I liked it.

01:02:26.087 --> 01:02:27.489
You did?

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:30.285
Look, that's not
what it is,

01:02:32.228 --> 01:02:34.094
<i>I'm just afraid of...</i>

01:02:34.095 --> 01:02:37.464
There's a guy, Philip, at reception.
He says he's the father?

01:02:37.465 --> 01:02:39.131
Do want me
to talk to this guy?

01:02:39.132 --> 01:02:41.000
No, no, no.
It's okay.

01:02:41.001 --> 01:02:42.337
I'll talk to him.

01:02:42.338 --> 01:02:44.737
It's okay.
Thank you both. Excuse me.

01:02:44.738 --> 01:02:47.573
Young man, don't you have
any sense of responsibility?

01:02:47.574 --> 01:02:50.476
I didn't even know, lady.
She never returned my calls.

01:02:50.477 --> 01:02:53.146
Christ, is it mine, Thea?

01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:54.613
Believe me, it's not yours.

01:02:54.614 --> 01:02:56.848
You can't be sure.
I did the math.

01:02:56.849 --> 01:02:58.250
Believe me.
I can be sure.

01:02:58.251 --> 01:03:00.017
<i>I demand a DNA test, I...</i>

01:03:00.018 --> 01:03:01.152
Yeah. I'll tell her.

01:03:01.153 --> 01:03:02.622
Bye.

01:03:02.623 --> 01:03:04.490
<i>Your sister needs you at home.</i>

01:03:04.491 --> 01:03:06.158
A fire
in the toilet?

01:03:06.159 --> 01:03:09.228
Your toilet's on fire?
Isn't that technically impossible?

01:03:09.229 --> 01:03:10.695
Who's Philip?

01:03:10.696 --> 01:03:13.800
Uh, an old, old boyfriend.
Big misunderstanding.

01:03:13.801 --> 01:03:15.134
Everything okay?

01:03:15.135 --> 01:03:17.803
Yeah. Everything's okay.
No worries here.

01:03:17.804 --> 01:03:21.804
Completely under control. But, uh, I...
I should probably get home to my sister.

01:03:21.805 --> 01:03:25.297
I'll meet you at the party.
Whoa. Sorry.

01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:40.057
Surprise!

01:03:40.058 --> 01:03:42.295
<i>Surprise</i>

01:03:43.397 --> 01:03:44.962
Hi, everyone.

01:03:44.963 --> 01:03:46.697
Oh my God,
Aunt Betty!

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:49.399
Surprise, darling'.
Darling'.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.268
It's so good
to see you.

01:03:52.269 --> 01:03:55.339
Aunt Jane and I just
drove in from Seattle.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:58.575
Oh, Aunt, thank you, it's
so sweet of you to do this.

01:03:58.576 --> 01:04:02.066
Thank you.

01:04:03.748 --> 01:04:05.049
Oooh!

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.150
Ooh, it's a onesies.
Just what I needed.

01:04:07.151 --> 01:04:08.751
We all decorated them.

01:04:08.752 --> 01:04:11.615
Who made this one?

01:04:13.891 --> 01:04:14.991
And this one?

01:04:16.594 --> 01:04:18.428
What a good job, Sam!

01:04:21.664 --> 01:04:23.467
That one's mine.

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:25.068
<i>I just thought</i>

01:04:25.069 --> 01:04:27.603
<i>It was a little ironic.</i>

01:04:27.604 --> 01:04:31.273
<i>More people are coming.
- Hi.</i>

01:04:31.274 --> 01:04:34.078
Whoa.

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:37.712
Hey, well, I hate to break up
the party, but... uh, we need to talk.

01:04:37.713 --> 01:04:39.714
<i>Everybody hang onto your seats</i>

01:04:39.715 --> 01:04:42.016
just in case something
happens to her story.

01:04:42.017 --> 01:04:44.987
Uh... no, I should get changed.
I need to be at a work event.

01:04:44.988 --> 01:04:47.254
So thank you
for the shower, everyone.

01:04:47.255 --> 01:04:49.123
Thank you.

01:04:49.124 --> 01:04:51.420
<i>Bye.</i>

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:57.566
She is so out of control.
Look. She has stockpiled

01:04:57.567 --> 01:05:01.768
all of this random stuff in her closet.
I mean, what is this? Seriously.

01:05:01.769 --> 01:05:03.504
It was on sale.

01:05:03.505 --> 01:05:07.241
Okay. I need you to say,
My name is Thea and I'm not pregnant.

01:05:07.242 --> 01:05:09.944
This is ridiculous.
And I've gotta go.

01:05:09.945 --> 01:05:12.069
Come here.

01:05:13.113 --> 01:05:16.480
<i>You have got to come clean.</i>

01:05:17.084 --> 01:05:21.587
I will. Okay?
I promise. Just not yet.

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:25.393
It's just I'm better pregnant.
For once, my life doesn't suck.

01:05:25.394 --> 01:05:29.295
<i>And I can't go back to being
Jerry's secretary or unemployed.</i>

01:05:29.296 --> 01:05:32.798
What are you gonna do?
Stay pregnant for the rest of your life?

01:05:32.799 --> 01:05:36.336
People will
get suspicious.

01:05:36.337 --> 01:05:38.738
Act like a grown-up.
Stop playing dress-up.

01:05:38.739 --> 01:05:42.073
Oh, my God, this is ridiculous.
Take off the stomach now!

01:05:42.074 --> 01:05:43.307
No.

01:05:43.308 --> 01:05:45.112
Then I'm gonna
take it off for you.

01:05:45.113 --> 01:05:46.379
Get off of me!

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.614
Let me take it off!

01:05:47.615 --> 01:05:48.881
Get off of me.

01:05:48.882 --> 01:05:52.416
Oh, hey! Hey, guys!
Emma, stop it!

01:05:52.417 --> 01:05:54.053
<i>Stop it...</i>

01:05:54.054 --> 01:05:55.387
<i>Let me take it off</i>

01:05:55.388 --> 01:05:56.888
Making noise.

01:05:56.889 --> 01:05:58.189
They are
making noise.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:59.457
Hey! Stop it!

01:05:59.458 --> 01:06:00.658
Take that thing off.

01:06:00.659 --> 01:06:03.293
<i>I said stop. Gosh.</i>

01:06:03.294 --> 01:06:05.632
<i>Come on.</i>

01:06:05.633 --> 01:06:06.864
Stay back!

01:06:06.865 --> 01:06:08.466
I'll get that
thing off of you.

01:06:08.467 --> 01:06:09.667
Get off of me!

01:06:09.668 --> 01:06:11.437
I'm gonna take
that thing off now!

01:06:11.438 --> 01:06:12.537
Give it back!

01:06:12.538 --> 01:06:13.905
Agh.

01:06:13.906 --> 01:06:15.542
What are you doing?

01:06:18.076 --> 01:06:19.976
You are so grounded!

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:22.238
Forever!

01:06:26.685 --> 01:06:29.219
<i>Uh... ladles.</i>

01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:31.221
<i>I think we need to re-group.</i>

01:06:31.222 --> 01:06:34.155
<i>Stark raving mad.</i>

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:40.498
Excuse me.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:46.262
What are you doing?

01:06:51.242 --> 01:06:53.174
<i>I thought she was pregnant.</i>

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.413
Um.

01:06:56.414 --> 01:06:59.278
<i>I'm really confused.</i>

01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:13.794
Well, that is the last time
I throw a surprise party for anyone.

01:07:13.795 --> 01:07:15.931
That baked ziti
goes home with me.

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.705
Sorry. I had to take
care of things with Em.

01:07:24.706 --> 01:07:26.275
The toilet fire?

01:07:26.276 --> 01:07:28.177
Yeah,
I got the blaze under control.

01:07:28.178 --> 01:07:30.282
You guys are amazing.
This is a great turnout.

01:07:30.283 --> 01:07:31.312
Thank you.

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:33.079
Okay.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:37.918
Time to struggle with public
speaking. Sit back and enjoy.

01:07:37.919 --> 01:07:39.353
You're gonna be great.

01:07:39.354 --> 01:07:40.454
Thanks.

01:07:44.057 --> 01:07:46.628
<i>What was that?
Are you guys, uh...</i>

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:49.195
I don't know.
Maybe. Kinda.

01:07:49.196 --> 01:07:50.730
<i>Hey. Good.</i>

01:07:50.731 --> 01:07:54.835
Good evening, everyone.
I'm back!

01:07:54.836 --> 01:07:57.372
<i>MacArthur finished
rehab a week early.</i>

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:01.073
What's the matter, Nicky?
You don't look happy to see me.

01:08:01.074 --> 01:08:04.009
Of course I am, Jerry.
Welcome back.

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:06.246
You're just in time
for Susie’s reading.

01:08:06.247 --> 01:08:07.981
I got a little
surprise for you.

01:08:07.982 --> 01:08:11.083
I just signed Rumsfeld
for his first book deal!

01:08:11.084 --> 01:08:12.518
Donald?

01:08:12.519 --> 01:08:14.719
No, Carlos.
Of course Donald.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.788
I met him
at the rehab facility.

01:08:16.790 --> 01:08:18.858
His cat had a terrible
case of sciatica.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:21.462
They had to put the poor thing
on oxycontin. She got addicted.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:22.662
It was a mess.

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:24.461
I'm in the middle
of something.

01:08:24.462 --> 01:08:27.365
Rummy's book is genius.
It's gonna put us back on the map.

01:08:27.366 --> 01:08:30.069
It's a completely unique
opus about his time in Iraq

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:32.438
sprinkled with some
of his favorite recipes.

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.971
It's called "Fire It Up".
Here's the manuscript.

01:08:34.973 --> 01:08:38.310
<i>It sounds great, Jerry, but I've
got a reading now. Can this wait?</i>

01:08:38.312 --> 01:08:40.612
you know what?
I'll be reading my book.

01:08:40.613 --> 01:08:44.206
<i>I'm shuttling down
your little operation.</i>

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:47.252
Jerry, Susie’s
book is a real gem.

01:08:47.254 --> 01:08:49.019
It could be a hit
for the company.

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.589
What are you so afraid of?
That I might do a better job than you?

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:54.823
Hmm. Let me think.

01:08:54.823 --> 01:08:58.529
Have you ever done
better than me at anything?

01:08:58.531 --> 01:09:01.930
Hello, everybody. I've got
a treat for you tonight.

01:09:01.932 --> 01:09:05.234
I'm gonna be reading from
Donald Rumsfeld's new book.

01:09:05.236 --> 01:09:07.671
<i>Here's a particularly
touching passage</i>

01:09:07.673 --> 01:09:11.140
about a short rib recipe he
picked up while in Baghdad.

01:09:11.142 --> 01:09:14.408
Susie’s reading. Go read your
cookbook somewhere else, Jerry.

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:16.913
Step away
from the podium now!

01:09:18.015 --> 01:09:20.750
Make me.

01:09:20.751 --> 01:09:21.885
He begins.

01:09:21.886 --> 01:09:23.118
Agh!

01:09:30.026 --> 01:09:31.693
Get off!

01:09:31.694 --> 01:09:34.630
<i>Okay. Okay.
Stop it I that's enough.</i>

01:09:34.631 --> 01:09:37.902
That's enough.
Stop it. Get off of him.

01:09:37.903 --> 01:09:41.536
How pathetic. you have to have
your secretary defend you.

01:09:41.537 --> 01:09:43.138
She's not a secretary.

01:09:43.139 --> 01:09:46.274
Oh, really? Then what is she,
other than shrill?

01:09:46.276 --> 01:09:48.978
She's a fantastic editor.

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:52.948
Oh, that's rich. An editor?

01:09:52.948 --> 01:09:56.883
So I go away for a few months,
and the world's lamest accountant

01:09:56.884 --> 01:09:59.988
is running my company with
the world's dumbest secretary.

01:09:59.989 --> 01:10:02.424
<i>All I can say is,</i>

01:10:02.425 --> 01:10:04.925
I hope your kid
doesn't inherit your brains.

01:10:06.726 --> 01:10:07.995
Oh!

01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:09.829
Be careful! Be careful...

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.899
Oh, God!

01:10:14.969 --> 01:10:17.506
<i>Oh.</i>

01:10:17.507 --> 01:10:21.304
<i>What happened to your stomach?</i>

01:10:27.281 --> 01:10:29.918
Oh, Nicky.

01:10:29.919 --> 01:10:32.886
You always were such
a good judge of character.

01:10:32.887 --> 01:10:36.220
Nick. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:10:36.221 --> 01:10:40.393
I never meant for things to go this far.

01:10:40.394 --> 01:10:44.763
Jerry was gonna fire me and I
couldn't afford to get fired.

01:10:44.764 --> 01:10:48.535
And I thought the whole thing
would blow over in a day or two.

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:52.003
Blow over
in a day or two?

01:10:54.942 --> 01:10:58.341
What kind of person
pretends to be pregnant?

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.984
<i>Nick. I'm sorry. Just...</i>

01:11:04.985 --> 01:11:07.884
<i>Please, just... Nick.</i>

01:11:24.902 --> 01:11:27.637
Hey, Nick, it's Thea, um...

01:11:27.638 --> 01:11:29.908
I'm kinda wondering
what you're up to.

01:11:29.909 --> 01:11:33.478
Kinda of assuming that what
you're up to is hating me.

01:11:33.479 --> 01:11:36.546
Kinda feeling very
bad about that.

01:11:36.547 --> 01:11:40.017
Anyway. Call me.

01:11:41.687 --> 01:11:43.921
Hi, Nick.
Thea again.

01:11:43.922 --> 01:11:48.356
I just wanna say
that I'm so, so sorry.

01:11:48.357 --> 01:11:50.961
I was talking
to your mother about it.

01:11:50.962 --> 01:11:53.363
She and I are on the
same page on this thing.

01:11:53.364 --> 01:11:57.599
I would rather say extra virgin olive
oil. I don't wanna abbreviate it.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.171
Hi, Nick, it's me. Uh...

01:12:02.172 --> 01:12:05.208
I know you haven't been interested
in picking up the phone...

01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:10.271
But I just wanted to tell you
how much really... really...

01:12:22.459 --> 01:12:25.517
<i>Hall</i>

01:12:26.095 --> 01:12:28.527
<i>Wow...</i>

01:12:30.233 --> 01:12:32.168
<i>So...</i>

01:12:32.169 --> 01:12:35.236
what have
you been up to?

01:12:35.237 --> 01:12:38.905
Watching the Vista
on an endless loop.

01:12:38.906 --> 01:12:40.775
It's self-inflicted torture.

01:12:40.776 --> 01:12:42.443
That sounds healthy.

01:12:42.444 --> 01:12:45.380
Well, it smells like
something died in here.

01:12:45.381 --> 01:12:46.947
It did.

01:12:46.948 --> 01:12:49.116
My soul.

01:12:49.117 --> 01:12:51.786
Thea. you've gotta give
yourself a tiny break.

01:12:51.787 --> 01:12:53.087
People make mistakes.

01:12:53.088 --> 01:12:54.588
I majorly screwed up.

01:12:54.589 --> 01:12:56.758
Well, look on
the bright side.

01:12:56.759 --> 01:12:58.959
<i>They're still talking
about it at work.</i>

01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.162
How's Nick doing?

01:13:00.163 --> 01:13:02.662
<i>I don't know.
He resigned.</i>

01:13:02.663 --> 01:13:04.430
What?

01:13:04.431 --> 01:13:06.766
Did he say anything
about what he's gonna do?

01:13:06.767 --> 01:13:10.170
<i>If you're asking me If he he'd
track you down and propose to you</i>

01:13:10.171 --> 01:13:12.605
<i>and spend the rest
of your lives together?</i>

01:13:12.606 --> 01:13:14.440
No. He wasn't specific.

01:13:14.441 --> 01:13:17.275
I've been calling
him and calling him.

01:13:17.276 --> 01:13:19.212
And he won't call me back.

01:13:19.213 --> 01:13:21.382
<i>Yeah, well maybe that
has something to do...</i>

01:13:21.383 --> 01:13:25.219
with the massively twisted lie you've
told him for the last few months.

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:28.152
Do you think
he'll ever forgive me?

01:13:29.354 --> 01:13:32.757
Do you want me to be honest or do
you want me to make you feel better?

01:13:32.758 --> 01:13:35.128
How are Susie’s book sales?

01:13:35.129 --> 01:13:36.996
<i>Good.</i>

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:40.967
you know, uh...
there's still a few boxes...

01:13:40.968 --> 01:13:43.335
that we need to
distribute here and there.

01:13:43.336 --> 01:13:45.598
Oh, no.

01:13:56.615 --> 01:13:57.947
Sorry.

01:13:57.948 --> 01:14:01.020
Hey.

01:14:01.021 --> 01:14:03.317
Mind if I join you?

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:06.379
It's a free country.

01:14:17.369 --> 01:14:19.434
Hm. What's in this? Mint?

01:14:19.435 --> 01:14:21.071
Yup.

01:14:21.072 --> 01:14:23.573
It's perfect
with the pear.

01:14:23.574 --> 01:14:25.441
It's so unexpected.

01:14:25.442 --> 01:14:30.138
That was actually... um, my idea.
I kinda just thought it would work.

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:32.651
Dad would have loved it.

01:14:32.652 --> 01:14:35.351
Mom would have
thought it was too fussy.

01:14:35.352 --> 01:14:40.914
But she would have polished off the
leftovers after everyone went to bed.

01:14:45.161 --> 01:14:49.061
I'm a big fat liar and I'm sorry
you got stuck with me.

01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.969
Listen, Em. We're gonna
make this work. Okay?

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:57.005
I made an appointment with the Culinary
I institute to talk about student loans.

01:14:57.006 --> 01:15:00.674
And I talked to Ms. Talbot
about scholarships.

01:15:00.675 --> 01:15:03.979
you know, Mom and Dad would
have been so proud of you.

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.647
Thanks.

01:15:17.293 --> 01:15:19.986
<i>It needs, um...</i>

01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:21.997
I think
ten more minutes.

01:15:21.998 --> 01:15:23.599
I don't have
ten more minutes.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.433
But it's gonna
be all gooey inside.

01:15:25.434 --> 01:15:27.268
I'll just have
to take my chances.

01:15:27.269 --> 01:15:30.503
<i>Here she comes.
Here comes Claire, everybody.</i>

01:15:30.504 --> 01:15:32.808
<i>I love you.</i>

01:15:32.809 --> 01:15:35.075
I haven't missed
a show in five years.

01:15:35.076 --> 01:15:37.110
Thank you. But you
should get out more.

01:15:37.111 --> 01:15:38.344
I'm kidding.

01:15:38.345 --> 01:15:40.279
I'm Thea Olayhill,
your biggest fan.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:43.118
I made you a pineapple cake.
It's your favorite, right?

01:15:43.119 --> 01:15:45.286
Yes. Good reconnaissance.
Good for you.

01:15:45.287 --> 01:15:48.688
How did you know
about the cake?

01:15:48.689 --> 01:15:52.284
Her May 15th show.
She said it in passing.

01:15:54.329 --> 01:15:56.129
I have some
books for you.

01:15:56.130 --> 01:15:58.398
Oh, great. Just leave
'em right over there.

01:15:58.399 --> 01:16:00.765
Okay. Keep your womb open.

01:16:00.766 --> 01:16:02.369
you've got it.

01:16:02.370 --> 01:16:06.005
I actually would like even
more toppings on my... Hello.

01:16:06.006 --> 01:16:09.407
<i>Hey. Thea Cahill, your number
one fan with banana cream pie.</i>

01:16:09.408 --> 01:16:13.902
you do your homework. I hope it's
as delicious as your pineapple cake.

01:16:22.658 --> 01:16:24.889
you can hit a few more
potholes next time.

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:26.257
<i>Claire, I love you.</i>

01:16:26.258 --> 01:16:27.825
<i>There she Is. Claire.</i>

01:16:27.826 --> 01:16:30.260
There she is. My number
one fan, Thea Olayhill.

01:16:30.261 --> 01:16:32.265
Uh... pear ginger pie.

01:16:32.266 --> 01:16:34.400
Nicely done, Betty Crocker.

01:16:34.401 --> 01:16:36.701
It's actually not me,
it's my little sister.

01:16:36.702 --> 01:16:38.870
What's your angle
besides making me a pig?

01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:40.737
Wanna get your
little sister on TV?

01:16:40.738 --> 01:16:44.276
I really wanna get this book on TV.
It's really special.

01:16:44.277 --> 01:16:47.478
Okay. Thank you.

01:16:47.479 --> 01:16:49.844
Thanks.

01:16:50.414 --> 01:16:52.573
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:17:09.068 --> 01:17:11.867
I bet I'm the last person
you wanted to see right now.

01:17:11.868 --> 01:17:15.338
Well, maybe
not the last person.

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:18.007
Maybe the second
or third to last person.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:22.210
I wouldn't want to see my 6th grade
English teacher, Ms. Posey. She was awful.

01:17:22.211 --> 01:17:25.414
Or my college boyfriend. He
dumped me on an answering machine.

01:17:25.415 --> 01:17:28.850
Listen, Susie.
I'm really sorry,

01:17:28.851 --> 01:17:32.087
I really wish I could have been
the person you thought I was.

01:17:32.088 --> 01:17:34.124
I just figured
if I told you the truth,

01:17:34.125 --> 01:17:38.294
you wouldn't want me in your life
and I really enjoyed being in your s.

01:17:38.295 --> 01:17:41.395
I really enjoyed
being in your life, too,

01:17:41.396 --> 01:17:43.499
for what it's worth.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.867
Well, I've got some
really good news.

01:17:45.868 --> 01:17:47.102
<i>We're gonna...</i>

01:17:47.103 --> 01:17:48.370
Ow!

01:17:48.371 --> 01:17:50.105
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:17:50.106 --> 01:17:52.206
The baby's coming.

01:17:52.207 --> 01:17:53.376
Right now?

01:17:53.377 --> 01:17:55.077
My water broke
this morning.

01:17:55.078 --> 01:17:57.378
My contractions
started an hour ago. Ow!

01:17:57.379 --> 01:17:58.846
Where is everyone?

01:17:58.847 --> 01:18:01.648
Jesse's on his way.

01:18:01.649 --> 01:18:04.056
What should I do?
Hot water? Towels?

01:18:04.057 --> 01:18:06.753
Let's just get in the car
and go to the hospital.

01:18:06.754 --> 01:18:10.124
A lotta people can help us there.
I can't really do much here.

01:18:10.125 --> 01:18:12.292
No, no, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:18:12.293 --> 01:18:14.062
My contraction ended.

01:18:14.063 --> 01:18:16.063
It'll be hours before
I have this baby.

01:18:16.064 --> 01:18:17.564
It's already
that painful?

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:20.033
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

01:18:20.034 --> 01:18:23.268
It's gonna get a whole lot worse
before we turn this mother out.

01:18:23.269 --> 01:18:25.340
<i>What were you saying?</i>

01:18:25.341 --> 01:18:27.174
Oh... um, the Vista wants you.

01:18:28.810 --> 01:18:30.344
Are you sure
this is normal?

01:18:30.345 --> 01:18:34.414
Yes, it's fine. The Vista?
That's amazing. When?

01:18:34.415 --> 01:18:36.782
In two hours.
They had a cancellation.

01:18:36.783 --> 01:18:39.419
Yeah.
That's not gonna work for me.

01:18:42.454 --> 01:18:45.325
Hurry!
We're gonna be late!

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:52.625
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:18:57.763 --> 01:18:59.671
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:01.106 --> 01:19:03.841
<i>I think I'm sitting
on something. Like this.</i>

01:19:05.247 --> 01:19:07.846
Hey, Em, it's me.
I desperately need a favor.

01:19:07.847 --> 01:19:11.508
Here you go.
Don't cry.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.091
Emma.

01:19:22.092 --> 01:19:23.259
Hi, Nick.

01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.563
What're you doing here?

01:19:24.564 --> 01:19:26.198
I have to take you somewhere.

01:19:26.199 --> 01:19:27.931
Excuse me?

01:19:27.932 --> 01:19:30.134
Please, don't make me explain.

01:19:30.135 --> 01:19:32.769
So if you just get your keys.
We really have to go.

01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:33.970
Emma.

01:19:33.971 --> 01:19:35.440
Come on!

01:19:35.441 --> 01:19:38.475
You're pulling our legs. Collectively.

01:19:38.476 --> 01:19:41.879
We absolutely have to begin in 3
minutes. your guy better get here.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:43.480
I promise he'll be here.

01:19:43.481 --> 01:19:45.984
He'll be here.
It's gonna be great.

01:19:45.985 --> 01:19:48.183
I don't know what's
keeping him so long.

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:50.652
It'd be really fun
to have you back again.

01:19:50.653 --> 01:19:53.555
When we come back,
"I'm So Over This...

01:19:53.556 --> 01:19:56.494
What It's Really Like To Be
Pregnant". So stick around.

01:19:57.728 --> 01:19:59.596
I need four asses
in those seats now.

01:19:59.597 --> 01:20:01.531
Oh, my God, Lisa.
What are we gonna do?

01:20:01.532 --> 01:20:02.698
You're gonna go.

01:20:02.699 --> 01:20:03.866
What?

01:20:03.867 --> 01:20:05.994
I don't wanna go.

01:20:06.905 --> 01:20:09.439
<i>How are you?
Thank you. Loved the book.</i>

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:13.608
Come on in. Hello,
little baby. Come on up.

01:20:13.609 --> 01:20:15.008
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:20:15.009 --> 01:20:18.646
Wow, Laura.
What an amazing story.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.884
I cannot believe that beautiful
baby was born at the DMV.

01:20:21.885 --> 01:20:24.885
So Thea, any kids?

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:26.955
Oh, no, never been pregnant.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:30.258
So why another pregnancy book?
Isn't the market a bit flooded?

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:32.260
<i>Well, this one's different.</i>

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:36.432
It's not a how-to book,
or a bunch of rules and recipes.

01:20:36.433 --> 01:20:39.967
These stories are ultimately
about the birth of a new love.

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.235
We're late.

01:20:41.236 --> 01:20:43.235
I can't believe
she booked with Vista.

01:20:43.236 --> 01:20:45.807
It can be messy but in the
end you're much stronger

01:20:45.808 --> 01:20:47.476
for having
gone througt.

01:20:47.477 --> 01:20:50.810
<i>Even If you did
something you may regret.</i>

01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:54.113
And to be honest,
I was just helping out.

01:20:54.114 --> 01:20:58.519
you know, I shouldn't even really be
sitting up here. It was Nick Steinwald

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.720
who's sitting in
the audience right now.

01:21:00.721 --> 01:21:02.722
He's responsible
for the whole thing.

01:21:02.723 --> 01:21:06.526
<i>He believed in the book
from the beginning and...</i>

01:21:06.527 --> 01:21:08.494
he believed in me.

01:21:08.495 --> 01:21:12.727
And... I really
can't thank him enough for that.

01:21:12.928 --> 01:21:16.621
Well, why don't we try, everybody,
how about it? Nick Steinwald...

01:21:16.622 --> 01:21:18.837
stand up!

01:21:18.838 --> 01:21:22.170
Get him a mike.

01:21:24.177 --> 01:21:27.847
So, she sings your praises. What is
about the book that appealed to you?

01:21:27.848 --> 01:21:31.516
<i>Um, well, uh...</i>

01:21:31.517 --> 01:21:35.353
I thought Suzie’s book had a fresh
and funny perspective on pregnancy.

01:21:35.354 --> 01:21:37.456
<i>Thea was right when
she said it was a book...</i>

01:21:37.457 --> 01:21:40.686
<i>about how love can
see you through anything.</i>

01:21:42.494 --> 01:21:44.261
<i>And how if...</i>

01:21:44.262 --> 01:21:46.865
if you love someone,

01:21:46.866 --> 01:21:50.970
<i>you can forgive
them for... all of the...</i>

01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:54.304
crazy and idiotic
things they do.

01:21:54.305 --> 01:21:57.442
Because love
is a leap of faith.

01:21:57.443 --> 01:22:00.143
<i>And...</i>

01:22:00.144 --> 01:22:03.014
sometimes you just
have to jump.

01:22:03.015 --> 01:22:06.413
<i>Don't you?</i>

01:22:07.886 --> 01:22:11.421
Wow. Okay. I'm gonna jump
in here for a second, and...

01:22:11.422 --> 01:22:15.558
uh, thank you both so much. Again,
the book is "I'm So Over This...

01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:17.962
What It's Really Like
To Be Pregnant".

01:22:17.963 --> 01:22:20.463
There's a link on
our website, The Vista. com

01:22:20.464 --> 01:22:23.466
One last thing, Nick.
Do you know how cute you are?

01:22:23.467 --> 01:22:25.000
Uh... no.

01:22:25.001 --> 01:22:27.005
<i>No, he doesn't, does he?</i>

01:22:27.006 --> 01:22:29.435
Okay, thank you very much.

01:22:49.959 --> 01:22:52.093
Hey, hey, hey! Guess what?

01:22:52.094 --> 01:22:54.762
The producer said there's
been over 100 thousand hits...

01:22:54.763 --> 01:22:57.968
on the show's link
to your book. Yeah.

01:22:57.969 --> 01:22:59.036
- That's fantastic.
- Yes, it is.

01:22:59.037 --> 01:23:00.268
<i>Thanks, Claire.</i>

01:23:00.269 --> 01:23:02.668
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:23:03.305 --> 01:23:05.966
Hey.

01:23:06.342 --> 01:23:07.978
Thank you.

01:23:07.979 --> 01:23:09.977
It's the least
I could do.

01:23:09.978 --> 01:23:13.514
I meant what I said about
I can't thank you enough,

01:23:13.515 --> 01:23:16.450
you know, now
that it's all over.

01:23:16.451 --> 01:23:18.646
What's over?

01:23:18.921 --> 01:23:20.688
Working together,

01:23:20.689 --> 01:23:24.258
being together,
just togetherness in general.

01:23:25.659 --> 01:23:27.526
It doesn't have to be.

01:23:27.527 --> 01:23:30.464
<i>We made a good book together.
We can make another one.</i>

01:23:30.465 --> 01:23:32.533
Would you
wanna do that?

01:23:32.534 --> 01:23:35.831
Yes. Yes, I would.

01:23:57.056 --> 01:23:58.792
Still feel backed up?

01:23:58.793 --> 01:24:00.360
Thanks, Greg.

01:24:00.361 --> 01:24:01.993
<i>Should It freak me out</i>

01:24:01.994 --> 01:24:04.395
<i>that he knows more about
your bowels than I do?</i>

01:24:04.396 --> 01:24:06.988
Uh, maybe that's
a good thing.

01:24:07.799 --> 01:24:10.471
If I've been timing these right,
and I'm sure I have,

01:24:10.472 --> 01:24:13.605
<i>You're up in ten,
nine, eight, seven...</i>

01:24:13.606 --> 01:24:15.140
Ow!

01:24:15.141 --> 01:24:17.007
<i>Yes just six seconds off.</i>

01:24:17.008 --> 01:24:18.244
What I'd miss?

01:24:18.245 --> 01:24:20.214
We're contracting
every half hour.

01:24:20.215 --> 01:24:21.881
You okay?

01:24:21.882 --> 01:24:24.449
<i>We're gonna kick
this puppy out at 0900.</i>

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:26.116
They should head out now.

01:24:26.117 --> 01:24:27.684
No one's
going anywhere...

01:24:27.685 --> 01:24:29.855
<i>the doctor said to
wait until every 15...</i>

01:24:31.256 --> 01:24:33.090
Wait. you're way off.

01:24:33.091 --> 01:24:35.025
- That one was not good.
- Way off.

01:24:35.026 --> 01:24:36.960
Jesus.
She's having a baby. Now!

01:24:36.961 --> 01:24:38.328
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:24:38.329 --> 01:24:39.831
Okay. No, no, no.

01:24:39.832 --> 01:24:41.664
What the hell
are we gonna do?

01:24:41.665 --> 01:24:43.066
Move! Move!

01:24:43.067 --> 01:24:45.636
My baby got
ten on the APGAR scores...

01:24:45.637 --> 01:24:47.938
your baby's maybe
like a seven or a eight.

01:24:47.939 --> 01:24:50.408
<i>If it's a boy,
feel free to name him Carl.</i>

01:24:50.409 --> 01:24:52.308
I forgot. Okay.

01:24:52.309 --> 01:24:53.910
<i>Get the epidural.</i>

01:24:53.911 --> 01:24:55.979
<i>Don't screw this up, you two.</i>

01:24:55.980 --> 01:24:58.450
- Are you ready?
- Let's hope.

01:24:58.451 --> 01:25:00.417
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:25:00.418 --> 01:25:02.485
<i>It's your fault.</i>

01:25:02.486 --> 01:25:03.787
Simper Fix.

01:25:03.788 --> 01:25:06.778
Push!
- Oh, not yet.
