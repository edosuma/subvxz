Oh, oh, so she was planning
all of this, then?

10:01.679 --> 10:05.998

think someone needs help

10:15.693 --> 10:19.947

the one that needs help.

10:19.948 --> 10:22.733

- Mm.
- I got married.

25:39.624 --> 25:42.608
Um, welf, wow.

25:42.609 --> 25:44.121
Who's the lucky lady?

25:44.122 --> 25:45.744
Norma Bates.

25:45.745 --> 25:49.565
She's a widow. She runs a
motel on the old highway.

25:49.566 --> 25:51.349
Why did you never mention her to me?

25:51.350 --> 25:52.884
We never mentioned a lot
of things to each other.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.218
Okay.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.486
I mean, it's not like we were, you know.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.054
You know what I mean.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.429
No, yeah, no, no, I know what you mean.

25:58.430 --> 26:00.131
- Come on. Look, I'm sorry.
- No, hey, don't be sorr...

26:00.132 --> 26:01.866
I mean, you're the one
that got married, not me.

26:02.888 --> 26:07.138
I can still sleep with
whoever I want to.

26:07.139 --> 26:08.390
Hmm.

26:10.792 --> 26:13.610
Hmm.

26:13.611 --> 26:15.413
But, um,

26:15.414 --> 26:16.814
in the meantime, I, uh...

26:16.815 --> 26:20.363
I need to ask you a
professional question.

26:20.364 --> 26:22.056
Yeah, what's that?

26:22.057 --> 26:26.260
You know, Bob Paris just took off...

26:26.261 --> 26:29.730
right before the DEA raided his house.

26:29.731 --> 26:32.366
Well, the DEA also came to the bank.

26:32.367 --> 26:35.168
They seized his accounts
and all of his records.

26:36.343 --> 26:37.597
Okay, what's the question?

26:37.598 --> 26:38.939
Am I in danger?

26:38.940 --> 26:41.041
What, because you've been
laundering his accounts?

26:41.042 --> 26:43.428
It depends. Did you do a good job?

26:44.512 --> 26:46.513
I've never heard anyone
mention your name

26:46.514 --> 26:49.225
or the bank or how any of
the money was laundered.

26:50.282 --> 26:51.285
Okay.

26:51.286 --> 26:53.420
They want Bob or anyone above Bob.

26:53.421 --> 26:55.923
You're a tangent. You're...

26:55.924 --> 26:58.192
Look, if you don't do anything
to call attention to yourself,

26:58.193 --> 26:59.511
I think you're fine.

27:02.815 --> 27:03.702
Right.

27:07.102 --> 27:10.404
Well, uh...

27:10.405 --> 27:12.105
hmm.

27:12.106 --> 27:13.884
Here's your key.

27:20.332 --> 27:22.973
Oh, and if you do, uh, find my socks,

27:22.974 --> 27:24.209
please let me know.

27:25.432 --> 27:26.955
They're pink.

28:55.668 --> 28:57.077
Norman's the only one
who's ever down here.

28:57.078 --> 28:58.296
Huh.

29:01.367 --> 29:03.050
What were you doing?

29:03.051 --> 29:05.385
I was looking for somewhere
to do my laundry.

29:05.386 --> 29:07.888
Just give me your laundry.
I like doing laundry.

bunch of money down here.

29:21.153 --> 29:22.676
Yeah, that's funny.

29:26.959 --> 29:28.575
Okay.

29:28.576 --> 29:30.610
Come on, I'll make us something to eat.

Hey.

29:57.069 --> 29:58.970
How's Emma doing?

29:58.971 --> 30:01.773
Um, yeah, she... she's
better and better every day,

30:01.774 --> 30:04.409
but, you know, still
has a long ways to go.

30:04.410 --> 30:05.426
Good.

30:05.427 --> 30:06.444
I, um...

30:06.445 --> 30:08.780
I just saw Romero leaving.
Is everything okay?

30:08.781 --> 30:10.281
Yeah, everything's fine.

30:10.282 --> 30:13.836
Uh, he will be around a fair amount.

30:20.426 --> 30:22.460
can't believe that Romero
would do all that for you.

30:22.461 --> 30:24.796
Well, yeah, well, he...
he's got his good side.

30:24.797 --> 30:25.964
You know, guys don't just...

30:25.965 --> 30:27.432
Don't just marry people

30:27.433 --> 30:28.833
because they want to give
them insurance coverage

30:28.834 --> 30:30.340
for the heck of it.

30:31.070 --> 30:33.004
Uh... he just wanted to help me out.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.939
Norma, I'm a... I'm a guy.

30:34.940 --> 30:36.748
Okay, I know what guys do.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.771
You know, he's...

30:40.112 --> 30:41.913
He's... he's not the worst
person in the world.

30:41.914 --> 30:45.133
Yeah, no, he... he's not the
worst person in the world,

30:45.134 --> 30:47.405
but I... I don't like him like that.

30:48.921 --> 30:51.139
I can't think about anything
but Norman right now.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.573
I... I'm worried about him all the time.

30:52.574 --> 30:54.826
I feel like I abandoned him.

30:54.827 --> 30:56.361
I just wish they would
let me talk to him.

30:56.362 --> 30:59.830
It... it's awful how it happened.

30:59.831 --> 31:01.082
No, I'm sorry.

31:02.418 --> 31:04.319
You're doing the right thing for him.

31:04.320 --> 31:05.634
I hope so.

31:06.839 --> 31:08.624
What if he says something wrong?

31:10.876 --> 31:13.144
All the secrets that I've tried to hide,

31:13.145 --> 31:15.249
things that other people
won't understand.

31:16.015 --> 31:18.016
I have no control over any of it,

31:18.017 --> 31:21.519
and I have tried so hard for
so long to protect him,

31:21.520 --> 31:23.038
until I couldn't.

31:25.157 --> 31:28.088
In a way, it doesn't matter.

31:28.089 --> 31:29.860
It's out there, for better or for worse,

31:29.861 --> 31:31.441
it's out of my hands.

31:32.487 --> 31:34.131
The chips will fall,

31:34.132 --> 31:37.286
so we'll see what happens.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.253
You know, I think that...

31:42.308 --> 31:44.937
I think maybe it's all
gonna be okay, Norma.

31:46.579 --> 31:48.831
You just have to allow it to be.

31:54.671 --> 31:57.395
Do you think you're going
to feel like talking today?

31:57.396 --> 31:59.117
[rain patters, clock ticks]

31:59.118 --> 32:01.158
I just have blackouts.

32:01.159 --> 32:03.249
Can I just get some medicine for that?

32:03.250 --> 32:04.742
You absolutely can.

32:05.648 --> 32:07.232
Your mom says that sometimes

32:07.233 --> 32:09.473
you talk to people who aren't there,

32:10.169 --> 32:12.019
that sometimes you can
get violently angry.

32:12.020 --> 32:13.538
So can she.

32:13.539 --> 32:14.678
Huh.

[sighs]

32:19.129 --> 32:20.395
[sighs]

32:20.396 --> 32:22.535
How can I help you, Norman?

32:24.250 --> 32:26.184
You want to know a secret?

32:26.185 --> 32:28.120
Everyone needs help.

32:29.205 --> 32:31.623
Someone is paying a lot of
money for you to be here,

32:31.624 --> 32:33.979
so you should take advantage of it.

32:35.394 --> 32:37.401
No one comes here for the food.

32:38.631 --> 32:40.651
You committed yourself, Norman.

32:40.652 --> 32:42.778
On some level, you want help.

32:43.272 --> 32:46.068
I think I can help you if you let me.

32:46.069 --> 32:48.956
You know that I am only
here because of my mother.

32:48.957 --> 32:50.108
You're 18.

32:50.109 --> 32:51.376
But it means something to her.

32:51.377 --> 32:53.427
Now, she would be upset if I didn't.

32:53.428 --> 32:55.280
And you don't want her to be upset.

32:55.281 --> 32:56.697
I never want her to be upset.

32:56.698 --> 32:58.483
She's the most wonderful
person in the world.

32:58.484 --> 33:00.497
Then why are you angry at her?

33:05.553 --> 33:06.519
I can't tell you that.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.570
Actually, you can.

33:07.571 --> 33:08.946
It's safe here.

33:19.734 --> 33:22.395
I'm angry because she asks too much.

33:23.537 --> 33:25.872
She wants too much.

33:29.043 --> 33:31.694
Now, I have tried to
always be there for her,

33:31.695 --> 33:33.430
and I have been a very good son,

33:33.431 --> 33:35.699
but there is just something
wrong with my mother,

33:35.700 --> 33:37.016
an... and she does things,

33:37.017 --> 33:38.567
and then she blames me,

33:38.568 --> 33:40.590
but these things I can't...
Just can't talk about.

33:40.591 --> 33:41.907
You can talk about them.

33:41.908 --> 33:43.443
Nothing bad is gonna happen...

33:43.444 --> 33:45.011
Oh, bad things will happen if I do,

33:45.012 --> 33:46.762
and... and, yes, if I
don't talk about them,

33:46.763 --> 33:47.964
then other bad things might happen,

33:47.965 --> 33:50.046
so I don't know what to do.

33:51.428 --> 33:53.903
I just don't want to hurt
her, but I am scared.

33:53.904 --> 33:55.605
Do you understand?

33:55.606 --> 33:57.024
I do understand.

33:58.442 --> 34:00.009
This is a tough dilemma,

34:00.010 --> 34:02.397
but maybe we can work through it.

34:04.848 --> 34:06.466
[slams furniture] Gah.

34:07.534 --> 34:08.868
[door slams shut]

34:21.915 --> 34:23.998
<i>I know I'm not allowed to see him yet,</i>

34:23.998 --> 34:26.202
and you couldn't even get
him my phone message,

34:26.203 --> 34:28.531
and... and I understand that.

34:29.306 --> 34:31.435
But I really need to see him,

34:32.242 --> 34:34.154
to know that he's okay.

34:35.212 --> 34:38.277
I'll ask Dr. Edwards
if he can talk to you.

34:40.828 --> 34:42.377
Thank you.

34:42.378 --> 34:45.935
We have these policies
for a reason, Norma.

34:46.828 --> 34:50.599
He's having a hard time, uh,
establishing trust with me.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.261
Uh, he needs to do that.

34:53.891 --> 34:56.243
It's kind of like sending
your kid away to camp.

34:56.244 --> 34:58.288
But Norman never went to camp.

34:59.597 --> 35:00.664
Mm.

35:01.765 --> 35:04.300
Maybe... maybe Norman is
feeling the same thing.

35:04.301 --> 35:05.919
We are very close.

35:05.920 --> 35:09.305
Maybe it would be good
for Norman to see me,

35:09.306 --> 35:11.457
allow him to know that
everything was okay

35:11.458 --> 35:13.408
and that he could focus on what it is

35:13.409 --> 35:15.073
he's trying to accomplish here.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.386
I'm just asking to see him once.

35:24.827 --> 35:27.655
<i>You know, Amelia, I am just so excited</i>

35:27.656 --> 35:30.258

<i>[laughs] Sweetie, I know what you mean.</i>

35:32.261 --> 35:33.755
<i>We haven't seen bargains like this</i>

<i>Well, if you're into tanzanite,</i>

<i>Are you talking about item 6381?</i>

35:44.912 --> 35:47.180
<i>Oh, be still my heart.</i>

35:47.181 --> 35:48.998
<i>[laughs] That's right.</i>

give it added sparkle.</i>

Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.

36:02.096 --> 36:04.364
<i>And if they're over a karat...</i>

36:04.365 --> 36:06.299
It's good to see you too.

36:06.300 --> 36:08.016
Oh, no, I was talking to my son.

36:08.017 --> 36:09.940
Well, I still mean it.

<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

36:16.710 --> 36:19.078
<i>I can't even believe that.</i>

I know you're angry at me right now,

36:37.445 --> 36:39.299
and I don't blame you.

36:39.300 --> 36:40.667
I just want to tell you

36:40.668 --> 36:43.303
how sorry I am about all this.

36:43.304 --> 36:46.806
We both know this is the best
place for you right now,

36:46.807 --> 36:49.141
and we have to think about the future,

36:49.142 --> 36:51.133
and this is not forever.

36:56.167 --> 36:57.116
Norman, say something.

36:57.117 --> 36:58.318
Just speak to me.

36:58.319 --> 37:00.020
What would you like me to say, Mother?

37:00.480 --> 37:01.854
You put me in this
place against my will.

37:01.855 --> 37:03.172
Because I am trying to help you.

37:03.173 --> 37:04.690
You don't need to whisper.

37:04.691 --> 37:06.659
There are no secrets here at Pineview.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.128
All I want for you

37:08.129 --> 37:10.430
is for you to get better

37:10.431 --> 37:12.332
and get the help that you need.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.690
I need?

37:14.768 --> 37:17.802
So I'm the only one that
needs help, really, Mother?

37:17.803 --> 37:19.639
We're still playing that game?

37:19.640 --> 37:20.932
Norman, I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:20.933 --> 37:22.250
The only reason that you are here

37:22.251 --> 37:23.351
is because I don't know how to help you.

37:23.352 --> 37:24.869
Well, I can't help anyone

37:24.870 --> 37:26.103
because I can't tell anyone the truth.

37:26.104 --> 37:27.104
What truth?

37:27.105 --> 37:28.255
That people have died,

37:28.256 --> 37:30.185
that we don't know why,

37:30.186 --> 37:32.614
that something is very, very wrong,

37:32.615 --> 37:33.916
and that you won't face it.

37:33.917 --> 37:34.961
Lower your voice.

37:34.962 --> 37:36.145
I don't want to lower my voice.

37:36.146 --> 37:38.030
I don't want to talk to you.

37:38.031 --> 37:41.334
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

37:41.335 --> 37:43.469
I'm actually afraid of you right now

37:43.470 --> 37:47.140
because you have put me in
this horrible position.

37:47.141 --> 37:49.016
What am I supposed to do, Mother?

37:50.044 --> 37:54.514
I just... I don't know, I don't...
I'm doing my best.

37:54.515 --> 37:57.401
Okay? I just... I just
want you to forgive me.

37:59.570 --> 38:01.520
I don't forgive you.

38:01.521 --> 38:03.523
I can't forgive you.

38:03.524 --> 38:04.891
Stuffing me in here,

38:04.892 --> 38:06.175
you have painted me in a corner

38:06.176 --> 38:08.227
that I cannot get out of,

38:08.228 --> 38:11.292
and I have never been so
disappointed in anyone.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.167
Norman.

38:14.168 --> 38:17.087
<i>[ominous music]</i>

38:39.410 --> 38:40.510
<i>Norma?</i>

38:45.512 --> 38:46.898
Wha... what happened?

38:46.899 --> 38:49.119
I went to see Norman.

38:53.057 --> 38:55.173
[sighs]

38:55.174 --> 38:57.427
I'm sorry.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.949
I begged him for forgiveness.

39:03.950 --> 39:07.036
He told me he had no feelings for me.

39:07.037 --> 39:09.015
It was like he was a different person.

39:11.592 --> 39:13.409
He's never been like this, ever.

39:13.410 --> 39:15.511
He's an 18-year-old kid.

39:15.512 --> 39:17.195
He's mad right now, okay?

39:17.196 --> 39:19.399
He's gonna get over it.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.267
You did the right thing.

39:21.268 --> 39:24.137
It's s... so scary.

39:24.138 --> 39:25.204
All of it.

39:25.205 --> 39:26.205
[sniffles]

39:26.206 --> 39:28.359
[sighs]

39:33.430 --> 39:36.615
And not just how he feels about me.

39:36.616 --> 39:38.701
If he says things...

39:38.702 --> 39:41.170
Things that he needs to say,

39:41.171 --> 39:43.272
I could lose him forever.

39:47.344 --> 39:50.346
No, you... you're doing the right thing.

40:01.759 --> 40:04.660
<i>[warm piano music]</i>

40:21.478 --> 40:23.161
I don... I don't think
we should do this yet.

40:23.162 --> 40:24.530
I want to do it.

40:24.531 --> 40:26.098
No, don't... Don't play with me, okay?

40:26.099 --> 40:28.695
I'm not. I'm not.

40:30.654 --> 40:32.170
Are you sure you want to do this?

40:32.171 --> 40:34.291
I'm sure I want to do this right now.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.195
Now, Norman. You can't just go in there.

40:57.196 --> 40:59.398
- I just want to talk...
- Hey, a little help, please.

40:59.399 --> 41:02.033
No, let me through. He
wants to speak to me.

41:02.034 --> 41:04.019
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

41:04.020 --> 41:06.304
Easy, Norman. Easy.

41:06.305 --> 41:08.140
Get off me!

41:08.141 --> 41:10.225
I just want to talk to him!

41:10.226 --> 41:13.197
<i>[tense music]</i>

41:25.476 --> 41:28.215
Hey.

41:29.329 --> 41:30.891
I heard you were upset.

41:36.386 --> 41:37.719
I'm sorry I couldn't see you earlier.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.355
I was in the middle of a session.

41:39.356 --> 41:41.524
Oh, no, that's... That's all right.

41:41.525 --> 41:42.525
I understand.

41:42.526 --> 41:45.845
<i>[ominous music]</i>

41:45.846 --> 41:47.838
But I do need to tell you something.

41:49.349 --> 41:51.535
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

41:55.138 --> 41:58.537
I have reason to believe
that my mother is insane

41:59.860 --> 42:02.145
and might be killing people.

42:05.849 --> 42:07.466
You know if you make that accusation,

42:07.467 --> 42:10.353
I will have to report
this to the authorities.

42:12.248 --> 42:13.423
I do.
