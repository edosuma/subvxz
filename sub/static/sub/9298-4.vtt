00:01.826 --> 00:03.721
Where am I?

00:05.794 --> 00:07.877
Where are you?

00:10.297 --> 00:12.165
You're at the park?

00:14.068 --> 00:17.103
I don't see you.

00:19.908 --> 00:21.374
Oh, crap.

00:23.078 --> 00:24.877
Hi, mom.

00:24.879 --> 00:28.781
Yeah. I got Joey. We're on our way home.

00:28.783 --> 00:30.817
Yes, we'll do our homework.

00:30.819 --> 00:33.319
Okay. See you soon.

00:33.321 --> 00:35.321
Love you, too.

00:35.323 --> 00:37.023
Bye.

00:40.728 --> 00:42.995
Hi. Are you Mandy Mateo?

00:42.997 --> 00:44.764
Yeah.

00:44.766 --> 00:47.066
Hi. I'm miss Baker,
Joey's substitute teacher.

00:47.068 --> 00:49.135
He's hurt himself on the playground.

00:49.137 --> 00:51.037
Oh, no.

00:51.039 --> 00:52.371
Oh, he's okay, uh,

00:52.373 --> 00:53.840
but he fell pretty
hard off the jungle gym.

00:53.842 --> 00:55.875
Get in. I'll take you to him.

00:55.877 --> 00:57.944
Thanks.

01:00.114 --> 01:02.115
You got it? Yeah.

01:02.117 --> 01:03.583
Let's go.

01:11.860 --> 01:14.227
Wait. W-where are you going?

01:15.929 --> 01:17.930
The school's that way.

01:17.932 --> 01:20.233
Joey?

The cleaning
lady put this in the dryer.

02:06.748 --> 02:10.149
It's Vicuña Wool. Who puts
Vicuña Wool in a dryer?

02:10.151 --> 02:12.418
It's tight. Does it make me look fat?

02:12.420 --> 02:14.220
Yes. You look ginormous.

02:14.222 --> 02:16.055
I can't believe how fat you are.

02:16.057 --> 02:18.324
What -- what do you
weigh? Like 115 pounds?

02:18.326 --> 02:19.959
116.8.

02:19.961 --> 02:21.294
Wow, no wonder. Really?

02:21.296 --> 02:23.396
'Cause I've been craving
carbohydrates lately.

02:23.398 --> 02:25.031
Maybe it's a hormonal imbalance.

02:25.033 --> 02:26.766
Maybe you don't have enough to do.

02:26.768 --> 02:29.168
It's a little slow. Mm-hmm.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.336
Let's go to the gym.

02:30.338 --> 02:31.837
Yoga.

02:31.839 --> 02:34.073
- Boxing.
- Zumba.

02:34.075 --> 02:35.141
Beer.

02:35.143 --> 02:37.143
Jane!

02:37.145 --> 02:38.978
- Nicole?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

02:38.980 --> 02:40.313
That's Dan's wife.

02:40.315 --> 02:42.081
Your old partner in DCU?

02:42.083 --> 02:43.416
What? What happened?

02:43.418 --> 02:46.052
- Mandy's been taken.
- What?

02:46.054 --> 02:47.420
Joey --
Joey saw it.

02:47.422 --> 02:49.288
T-they took her in -- in
a car, near her school.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.691
And I-I need Dan. I need you to help me.

02:51.693 --> 02:53.926
Okay. Okay. Get Frost and Korsak now.

02:53.928 --> 02:55.895
Did you call 911?

02:55.897 --> 02:57.997
Yes, yes, and, uh, detective
Womack from area "e"

02:57.999 --> 03:00.099
said that they couldn't
put out an Amber Alert.

03:00.101 --> 03:01.334
Okay. Why not?

03:01.336 --> 03:03.069
Well, 'cause Joey just saw a-a blue car,

03:03.071 --> 03:05.338
and I guess it's not enough
information. Look, I need Dan!

03:05.340 --> 03:06.806
Okay, we'll get Dan.

03:06.808 --> 03:08.274
Okay? Vince, Vince!

03:08.276 --> 03:10.776
Get Dan Mateo. He's undercover in DCU.

03:10.778 --> 03:13.713
- Drug Control Unit. On it.
- Yes.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.148
Um, can I talk to Joey
just -- just for a sec?

03:16.150 --> 03:18.851
Nicole, let's go upstairs
and get a full description

03:18.853 --> 03:21.153
of what Amanda was wearing,
list of her friends.

03:21.155 --> 03:23.923
Look, I-I can't leave
him. He saw it happen.

03:23.925 --> 03:25.958
It's fine, mom. I want to help.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.393
Nicole, he'll be safe, all right?

03:27.395 --> 03:29.328
I'll have him back
upstairs in just a minute.

03:30.731 --> 03:32.965
Mm.

03:34.501 --> 03:37.203
Hey.

03:37.205 --> 03:38.871
We got a really great café.

03:38.873 --> 03:41.207
You want to go get a cookie or something?

03:41.209 --> 03:43.242
I don't want anything.

03:43.244 --> 03:45.344
Please just find my sister.

03:47.214 --> 03:49.815
Okay.

03:49.817 --> 03:52.318
We're gonna find her. Okay?

03:52.320 --> 03:53.986
- Okay?
- Okay.

03:53.988 --> 03:55.354
Come on. Let's go.

03:58.725 --> 04:01.193
You get real close when you
work undercover, you know?

04:01.195 --> 04:02.662
My life depended on Dan,

04:02.664 --> 04:06.165
and now his daughter's life depends on me.

04:06.167 --> 04:08.401
I know this is difficult to talk about,

04:08.403 --> 04:11.203
but I want to go through
it one more time, okay?

04:11.205 --> 04:13.739
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:13.741 --> 04:17.276
Did you see the license
plate? Any letters or numbers?

04:17.278 --> 04:21.613
No. No. Just that it was blue.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.651
Hey.

04:25.653 --> 04:29.221
Um, I bet you were looking
at your sister, weren't you?

04:29.223 --> 04:32.725
Yeah. She was really scared.

04:32.727 --> 04:35.027
I've never seen her look like that before.

04:35.029 --> 04:37.496
I bet you were scared, too.

04:37.498 --> 04:39.332
So scared.

04:39.334 --> 04:42.668
You know I used to work with your dad?

04:42.670 --> 04:44.904
I was his partner. Did he tell you that?

04:44.906 --> 04:46.739
No.

04:46.741 --> 04:48.674
Well, I bet he's taught you a lot

04:48.676 --> 04:50.276
about being a detective, huh?

04:50.278 --> 04:51.811
He says I'm good at it,

04:51.813 --> 04:53.779
but I should have looked
at the license plate.

04:53.781 --> 04:55.281
Hey, it's okay.

04:55.283 --> 04:57.683
Can you tell me about the lady again?

04:57.685 --> 05:00.786
She was driving. I could see her.

05:00.788 --> 05:03.189
What did she look like? Was she Caucasian?

05:03.191 --> 05:05.057
Was she African-American?

05:05.059 --> 05:08.060
She was white. She had brown hair.

05:08.062 --> 05:10.296
I think she was about as old as my mom.

05:10.298 --> 05:14.133
Okay. That's great. Can
you tell me about the man?

05:14.135 --> 05:17.336
I don't know. He was big.

05:17.338 --> 05:19.138
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:19.140 --> 05:21.040
It's okay.

05:21.042 --> 05:23.376
Hey, you mentioned that--
that the car was blue.

05:23.378 --> 05:26.445
Was it a station wagon? Was it a minivan?

05:26.447 --> 05:29.181
No. No, it was just a regular car.

05:29.183 --> 05:30.816
It was old.

05:30.818 --> 05:32.418
Okay.

05:32.420 --> 05:35.020
You keep thinking like
a detective, all right?

05:35.022 --> 05:37.289
I haven't h-helped much, have I?

05:37.291 --> 05:39.024
Yes, you have. Hey.

05:39.026 --> 05:41.360
Yes, you have. Okay?

05:43.764 --> 05:45.131
We'll be right back, okay?

05:45.133 --> 05:46.899
Okay.

05:52.205 --> 05:54.306
You think we can get
anything else out of him?

05:54.308 --> 05:56.008
He's been traumatized.

05:56.010 --> 05:58.911
I think if we give him
some drawing materials --

05:58.913 --> 06:00.846
you know, it's a natural
form of communication

06:00.848 --> 06:02.181
for children his age.

06:02.183 --> 06:04.016
Maybe he can draw something
that he can't verbalize.

06:04.018 --> 06:05.851
Ma, you got any crayons?

06:05.853 --> 06:08.120
- Yeah.
- We need some paper, too.

06:08.122 --> 06:09.889
Uh, how about the paper place mats?

06:09.891 --> 06:11.657
It's perfect. Thank you.

06:11.659 --> 06:14.894
Hey. I found Dan. He's on his way.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.962
Great. Okay.

06:16.964 --> 06:20.266
Um, I'm gonna be back in
just a little while, okay?

06:20.268 --> 06:22.334
- Okay.
- Just a little bit.

06:22.336 --> 06:25.104
Bye.

06:27.741 --> 06:29.775
She told Korsak they're separated.

06:29.777 --> 06:32.378
Dan and Nicole separated?

06:32.380 --> 06:33.813
When?

06:33.815 --> 06:36.382
God, this job just
kills every relationship.

06:36.384 --> 06:38.451
Nicole! Nicole.

06:38.453 --> 06:40.619
Dan!

06:40.621 --> 06:44.156
- Nicole. Why? Why were they alone?
- Look, I leave them for 45 minutes

06:44.158 --> 06:46.192
after school so that I can finish work.

06:46.194 --> 06:48.894
She's 13. Nicole, we live in a city!

06:48.896 --> 06:51.197
<i>Well, where were you?!
You left me with two kids</i>

06:51.199 --> 06:53.165
a-and a mortgage while
you live in your apartment!

06:53.167 --> 06:54.433
Because you kicked me out!

06:54.435 --> 06:56.936
Hey! Ho! Come on. Stop it.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.138
Stop it. Blaming Nicole isn't
gonna get your daughter back.

06:59.140 --> 07:00.339
Where is she? What do you know?

07:00.341 --> 07:02.775
We got a description on the car,

07:02.777 --> 07:04.210
and it's a man and a woman.

07:04.212 --> 07:06.178
A Jack and Jill? Jane,
we're not gonna get her back!

07:06.180 --> 07:07.813
Stop it. Yes, we will. All right?

07:07.815 --> 07:10.049
Dan! We will find her.

07:10.051 --> 07:12.218
Three hours!

07:12.220 --> 07:15.154
Three hours is the
average for abducted kids!

07:15.156 --> 07:16.722
We don't find her in
three hours, she's dead.

07:16.724 --> 07:18.591
All right. You let me
do my job. All right?

07:18.593 --> 07:21.360
You concentrate on taking care
of Joey and Nicole. Where's Joey?

07:21.362 --> 07:24.096
He's downstairs in the café
with my mother and Dr. Isles.

07:24.098 --> 07:26.398
I'm gonna go hold him.

07:29.002 --> 07:31.704
We can't get a hit on
the girl's cellphone GPS.

07:31.706 --> 07:34.707
Whoever grabbed her knew
enough to remove the battery.

07:34.709 --> 07:38.010
Amber alert with Mandy's picture is
out now. It's all over New England.

07:38.012 --> 07:40.846
Okay, good. How fast can we get
her computer and cellphone records?

07:40.848 --> 07:42.515
Fast. It's a cop's kid.

07:42.517 --> 07:44.984
Last time I saw Mandy,

07:44.986 --> 07:48.287
she -- she was just a
little girl, 5 maybe.

07:49.890 --> 07:53.158
- Where's Nicole?
- Korsak sent her home

07:53.160 --> 07:55.094
to get more photos of
Mandy and Mandy's computer.

07:55.096 --> 07:57.263
I'm working on getting into
her social-network sites.

07:57.265 --> 08:00.566
Okay.

08:06.206 --> 08:07.673
Hey, what are you doing?

08:07.675 --> 08:08.807
Eliminating Dan as a suspect.

08:08.809 --> 08:11.043
You think Dan snatched his own kid?

08:11.045 --> 08:12.611
Parents are in the middle
of a custody battle.

08:12.613 --> 08:14.914
I think we need to make sure

08:14.916 --> 08:16.682
Dan didn't have anything to
do with Mandy's disappearance.

08:16.684 --> 08:18.551
Korsak, we worked undercover
with Dan for two years.

08:18.553 --> 08:20.352
How could you possibly think
he had anything to do with this?

08:20.354 --> 08:22.354
I want to find Mandy as badly as you do.

08:22.356 --> 08:24.924
But we got to think like
cops, not like his friends.

08:24.926 --> 08:28.327
We got to rule him out, Jane.
Until we do, he's a suspect.

08:28.329 --> 08:30.062
But Joey said there was
a woman driving the car

08:30.064 --> 08:32.030
and a man in the backseat.
We're looking for a couple.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.966
I got to make sure it
isn't Dan in the backseat.

08:33.967 --> 08:37.001
Well, by the time you rule
him out, Mandy could be dead.

08:37.004 --> 08:39.371
Area "e" units are on
their way to stony brook.

08:39.373 --> 08:41.907
They just found the body of a young girl.

08:42.909 --> 08:45.878
Oh, God.

08:50.504 --> 08:51.736
When did you guys find her?

08:51.738 --> 08:53.338
Uh, 15 minutes ago.

08:53.340 --> 08:54.873
Potheads looking for a
little nature stumbled on her.

08:54.875 --> 08:58.610
We got here fast because of Amanda Mateo.

08:58.612 --> 09:01.312
Perfect spot. She could have
been laying here for months.

09:01.314 --> 09:03.481
Yeah, she was
hidden pretty well --

09:03.483 --> 09:05.016
in the trench, covered in leaves.

09:05.018 --> 09:07.986
We got lucky, if you can call it that.

09:07.988 --> 09:09.554
First responders move her?

09:09.556 --> 09:11.790
Yeah. We were all pulling for Dan.

09:11.792 --> 09:13.825
Hate to see it end like this.

09:16.328 --> 09:17.896
Man, I was at Mandy's christening.

09:17.898 --> 09:19.898
So was I.

09:19.900 --> 09:23.201
Is that Mandy?!
Hey, Dan.

09:23.203 --> 09:25.670
- Is that her? Is that Mandy?
- Dan. Dan. You can't be here, Dan.

09:25.672 --> 09:27.539
Dan. You can't be here, Danny!

09:27.541 --> 09:29.841
- Get off me, Vince!
- Dan!

09:29.843 --> 09:31.309
Jane.

09:31.311 --> 09:34.979
- Let go of me!
- Is it Mandy?

09:36.715 --> 09:38.817
I don't know. I can't tell.

09:38.819 --> 09:40.084
Vince!

09:41.487 --> 09:42.720
Let him look.

09:50.629 --> 09:53.932
Is -- is that
my daughter?

09:55.067 --> 09:57.202
I don't know.

10:14.054 --> 10:16.187
It's not her.

10:27.933 --> 10:31.469
Who is she?

10:31.471 --> 10:32.837
How'd she die?

10:32.839 --> 10:34.939
She was asphyxiated from the application

10:34.941 --> 10:37.408
of a slow, constant
pressure to her trachea.

10:37.410 --> 10:39.978
She looks a little like
Mandy. About the same age.

10:39.980 --> 10:41.512
How long she been dead?

10:41.514 --> 10:43.815
Not long.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.751
She's still warm to the
touch. Less than two hours.

10:46.753 --> 10:48.653
So she was murdered right
after Mandy was kidnapped.

10:48.655 --> 10:50.655
Same age, similar build, hair color.

10:50.657 --> 10:53.625
One girl kidnapped, another
one turns up dead an hour later.

10:53.627 --> 10:56.127
I don't believe in
coincidence like that. Do you?

10:56.129 --> 10:57.762
No.

10:57.764 --> 10:59.797
You think Mandy was a
replacement for this girl?

10:59.799 --> 11:01.432
Yeah.

11:01.434 --> 11:04.369
Is that a shoeprint on her neck?

11:04.371 --> 11:06.070
It's a heavy-treaded impression

11:06.072 --> 11:08.506
consistent with that of a work boot.

11:10.075 --> 11:13.511
Size 12.

11:13.513 --> 11:15.880
Joey said the man in the car was big.

11:15.882 --> 11:19.918
Is it possible that he crushed
her trachea with his foot?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.086
It's possible.

11:24.590 --> 11:25.757
What the hell?

11:28.827 --> 11:30.461
Maybe she's bound like
that so her kidnapper

11:30.463 --> 11:31.963
<i>could keep her looking like a young girl.</i>

11:31.965 --> 11:34.565
Okay, we need to find
out who this girl is. Now.

11:34.567 --> 11:36.567
There's a lot of missing kids, Jane.

11:36.569 --> 11:37.936
35,000 in New England alone.

11:37.938 --> 11:39.504
It'll take weeks to track
her by her dental records.

11:39.506 --> 11:40.939
Well, then, we take a picture of her face,

11:40.941 --> 11:43.541
and we show it to
Mandy's friends and family

11:43.543 --> 11:45.076
and see if anybody recognizes her.

11:48.814 --> 11:50.715
What are you doing?

11:50.717 --> 11:52.583
I'm checking her iliac-crest epiphysis.

11:54.654 --> 11:56.020
She's older than she appears.

11:56.022 --> 11:58.756
It's in its beginning stages of fusing.

11:58.758 --> 12:00.091
She's about 17.

12:04.863 --> 12:08.366
There's some type of staining
going on with her sweatshirt.

12:08.368 --> 12:09.600
The edges are white.

12:09.602 --> 12:11.369
I'm gonna take a guess, Jane.

12:11.371 --> 12:13.671
I-I think this is a
mixture of tears and mucus.

12:13.673 --> 12:15.974
Look where it is. Yeah,
it's in a weird spot.

12:15.976 --> 12:18.409
I don't think this is from our
victim. I think it's from someone else.

12:18.411 --> 12:19.911
What, like she was holding
someone against her.

12:21.513 --> 12:23.481
Dan's clear. Just saw the video.

12:23.483 --> 12:25.583
His squad had him under surveillance.

12:25.585 --> 12:27.585
He's doing drug buys the whole time.

12:27.587 --> 12:29.954
Thank God. I'm sorry, Jane.

12:29.956 --> 12:31.956
No, it's -- you
were right, Korsak.

12:31.958 --> 12:33.558
This is tough.

12:34.626 --> 12:36.995
Please, Maura. We got to
find an I.D. On this girl.

12:36.997 --> 12:40.164
Okay? She could be the key.

12:46.638 --> 12:50.641
You have to help us find Mandy.

12:55.347 --> 12:58.416
I really love the way you put the clouds

12:58.418 --> 13:01.686
behind the lighthouse.

13:03.288 --> 13:06.357
Can I get you some more coffee?

13:06.359 --> 13:07.792
No, thank you.

13:07.794 --> 13:10.595
Honey, Joey, look, I want
you to eat something, okay?

13:10.597 --> 13:12.864
- I'm not hungry.
- Oh, that's too bad.

13:12.866 --> 13:15.533
I have a big bowl of
cauliflower with your name on it.

13:15.535 --> 13:17.869
Yeah, he loves cauliflower. Right?

13:17.871 --> 13:19.404
No, I don't.

13:19.406 --> 13:20.772
I could put some hot sauce

13:20.774 --> 13:22.573
and some asparagus on the side.

13:22.575 --> 13:23.941
Yum-yum!

13:23.943 --> 13:27.445
- Do you have any hot dogs?
- I sure do.

13:27.447 --> 13:29.213
Can I have fries?

13:29.215 --> 13:30.948
Yeah.

13:32.786 --> 13:34.852
Hey, Joey.

13:34.854 --> 13:36.220
Hey.

13:36.222 --> 13:38.656
I, uh, brought Mandy's computer.

13:38.658 --> 13:40.925
Okay, great. Uh, detective
Frost will go through it.

13:40.927 --> 13:43.494
Dan and I --
um, we argued

13:43.496 --> 13:46.297
about whether or not she
should have her own computer.

13:46.299 --> 13:48.866
But, I mean, she needs
it for school, so...

13:48.868 --> 13:51.169
I'm sorry, Nicole.

13:55.908 --> 13:59.844
Oh, wow. She's so grown-up.

13:59.846 --> 14:01.779
She's beautiful, Nicole.

14:02.948 --> 14:04.582
Did I tell you that she, um...

14:04.584 --> 14:08.586
She plays soccer for
school? She's really good.

14:08.588 --> 14:10.621
No, I didn't know that.

14:10.623 --> 14:12.156
She looks strong.

14:14.693 --> 14:18.563
Uh, I have a picture that
I need you to look at.

14:20.232 --> 14:21.999
Okay, yeah. The girl you found?

14:22.001 --> 14:23.801
Yeah.

14:28.707 --> 14:30.842
No, don't recognize her.

14:30.844 --> 14:33.277
Okay.

14:33.279 --> 14:34.979
Honey, uh...

14:34.981 --> 14:38.816
Detective Rizzoli is gonna
show you a photo, okay?

14:38.818 --> 14:41.919
I need to know if you
recognize this girl, okay?

14:41.921 --> 14:43.588
Mm-hmm.

14:46.291 --> 14:48.626
Is she dead?

14:48.628 --> 14:50.161
Yes.

14:52.397 --> 14:54.699
Joey, do you know her?

14:54.701 --> 14:56.834
No.

14:56.836 --> 14:58.769
Okay.

14:58.771 --> 15:01.305
Would you like some chocolate milk?

15:01.307 --> 15:03.474
I just want Mandy.

15:03.476 --> 15:06.711
I know you do, sweetie. We all do.

15:10.449 --> 15:13.351
It's been over three hours
since Mandy was abducted.

15:13.353 --> 15:15.620
<i>It's an average, Jane.</i>

15:15.622 --> 15:18.356
God, she looks so young.

15:18.358 --> 15:21.259
And she's so thin.

15:21.261 --> 15:22.894
What happened to you?

15:22.896 --> 15:26.397
Well, she has a vitamin-d deficiency,

15:26.399 --> 15:29.934
uh, atrophied muscles,
stunted growth, pale skin,

15:29.936 --> 15:32.336
exhibits signs of malnutrition.

15:32.338 --> 15:33.671
Was she held in captivity?

15:33.673 --> 15:35.173
That's my opinion.

15:35.175 --> 15:38.476
- Any signs of sexual assault?
- Yes.

15:38.478 --> 15:41.479
She has elevated estrogen
and progesterone levels.

15:41.481 --> 15:43.514
She was on birth-control pills.

15:43.516 --> 15:45.783
You know, when I first
heard that it was a couple,

15:45.785 --> 15:46.918
my mind immediately went

15:46.920 --> 15:50.454
to Jaycee Dugard and Elizabeth Smart.

15:50.456 --> 15:52.256
How long was she held?

15:52.258 --> 15:53.824
Given my findings...

15:53.826 --> 15:56.327
I'd say this girl was in captivity

15:56.329 --> 15:58.229
from three to five years.

15:58.231 --> 16:01.365
I've arrested hundreds
of male sexual offenders.

16:01.367 --> 16:02.833
I'm not saying I understand that,

16:02.835 --> 16:04.702
but what I can't ever get my head around

16:04.704 --> 16:07.972
<i>is how a woman could
help do this to someone.</i>

16:07.974 --> 16:10.408
Well, you have to look at
the women as victims, too.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.211
They're typically very damaged people,

16:13.213 --> 16:14.745
ripe for abuse.

16:14.747 --> 16:17.615
And the abused becomes the abuser.

16:17.617 --> 16:18.716
Exactly.

16:18.718 --> 16:20.284
And they help him...

16:20.286 --> 16:23.621
Create this bizarre
version of a nuclear family

16:23.623 --> 16:25.389
with him in the center.

16:27.626 --> 16:29.427
It's Frost.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.128
He's got Mandy's phone records.

16:31.130 --> 16:32.797
All right. Go. I'll be here.

16:32.799 --> 16:35.733
Jane, I'm doing -- I'm
doing everything I can here.

16:35.735 --> 16:39.570
I know you are.

16:48.947 --> 16:52.750
Help me find Mandy.

16:52.752 --> 16:55.953
What am I not seeing that I need to see?

16:59.691 --> 17:02.360
Sweet girl.

17:03.695 --> 17:07.565
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

17:12.273 --> 17:14.924
She had a Facebook account,
MySpace and Twitter.

17:15.044 --> 17:17.537
Wow. This generation
puts their whole lives online.

17:17.539 --> 17:20.006
Yeah, pretty much.

17:20.008 --> 17:22.309
She had it set so that only her
friends could see most of it,

17:22.310 --> 17:24.277
but there were still some public areas.

17:24.279 --> 17:26.680
- So anybody could get a look at her.
- Afraid so.

17:26.682 --> 17:28.648
Got her phone records.

17:30.451 --> 17:31.885
What are those?

17:31.887 --> 17:35.622
Are those social-network
sites? I didn't agree to that.

17:35.624 --> 17:38.391
Dan, you can't be in here
if you're gonna interfere.

17:39.527 --> 17:41.728
I'm soy. What do you have?

17:41.730 --> 17:43.497
Mandy's phone records.

17:43.499 --> 17:45.198
Look, she gets out of
school at 3:15, okay?

17:45.200 --> 17:46.867
She's supposed to pick
Joey up and take him home.

17:46.869 --> 17:50.270
He said that she told him to
wait at the playground. Why?

17:50.272 --> 17:51.905
Well, here's her last call.

17:51.907 --> 17:55.208
3:29 P.M. It's from her mother.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.344
Well, she texts nonstop.
Where are the texts?

17:57.346 --> 18:00.480
Your wife said she, uh,
got Mandy a new smartphone.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.251
Keep going, Frost.

18:04.253 --> 18:05.752
Well, it's actually good for us.

18:05.754 --> 18:07.821
I got a whole series of I.M.S.

18:07.823 --> 18:09.289
What's the difference?

18:09.291 --> 18:11.157
Well, texts go through the phone system.

18:11.159 --> 18:13.159
We can get the phone
numbers but not the content.

18:13.161 --> 18:15.695
Instant messages go
across wireless Internet.

18:15.697 --> 18:17.397
So Mandy was instant-messaging.

18:17.399 --> 18:18.899
Can you see what she was saying?

18:18.901 --> 18:21.401
Yes, and we can track the messages

18:21.403 --> 18:23.370
back to phones and computers.

18:23.372 --> 18:26.339
Here's every screen name she
instant-messaged in the last week.

18:29.710 --> 18:32.145
We got a whole series of I.M.S

18:32.147 --> 18:33.813
between Mandy and "suprgurrl97."

18:33.815 --> 18:35.715
Who's "suprgurrl"?

18:35.717 --> 18:38.251
Chloe Cameron.

18:38.253 --> 18:40.220
That's her best friend.

18:40.222 --> 18:43.690
"Madmandy97: Where are you?"

18:43.692 --> 18:46.092
"Suprgurrl97: See you at
park entrance. Come on."

18:46.094 --> 18:48.895
See you at the park entrance? Why's
she going to the park entrance?

18:48.897 --> 18:50.630
That's the last message there.

18:50.632 --> 18:52.666
But maybe that's why she left Joey.

18:52.668 --> 18:55.635
Only Chloe can tell us now.

18:56.737 --> 18:59.606
Thank you for coming down right away.

18:59.608 --> 19:01.675
It's okay. Anything we can do.

19:01.677 --> 19:03.710
Are you gonna find Mandy?

19:03.712 --> 19:05.745
I hope so, Chloe.

19:05.747 --> 19:09.082
Can you tell us why you were meeting
her in the park this afternoon?

19:09.084 --> 19:10.650
I wasn't.

19:10.652 --> 19:12.252
You're not in trouble, honey.

19:12.254 --> 19:14.421
But we have to do everything
we can to find Mandy.

19:14.423 --> 19:16.423
Why did Mandy leave Joey
at school to come meet you?

19:16.425 --> 19:18.058
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:18.060 --> 19:20.260
You were I.M.'ing with
her right after school.

19:20.262 --> 19:21.628
We have the records.

19:21.630 --> 19:23.196
No. I-I wasn't.

19:23.198 --> 19:25.632
Chloe, you two are texting all the time.

19:25.634 --> 19:27.334
Please, just tell the detectives.

19:27.336 --> 19:28.702
We don't text anymore, mom.

19:28.704 --> 19:30.804
Mandy got a new phone so we could I.M.

19:30.806 --> 19:33.239
And what did you I.M.?

19:33.241 --> 19:34.674
I told you. I didn't.

19:34.676 --> 19:36.276
I had volleyball practice
right after school --

19:36.278 --> 19:37.677
no phones allowed.

19:37.679 --> 19:39.379
Okay.

19:39.381 --> 19:44.284
Can you take a look at these
messages between you and Mandy?

19:47.788 --> 19:49.823
That's not me.

19:49.825 --> 19:51.291
Look. There's a "u."

19:51.293 --> 19:56.296
I'm "suprgrrl."
G-r-r. No "u."

19:59.734 --> 20:01.735
Someone was pretending to be Chloe.

20:01.737 --> 20:03.570
To lure Mandy to the park.

20:03.572 --> 20:06.239
They knew her eye would skate
right over that extra "u"

20:06.241 --> 20:08.908
while she was I.M.'ing her
best friend, just like ours did.

20:08.910 --> 20:11.344
This whole thing has been a
setup from start to finish.

20:11.346 --> 20:14.114
And I don't get all this texting
and you-ing and I'm-ing and --

20:14.116 --> 20:15.515
I.M.'ing. Whatever.

20:15.517 --> 20:17.450
But I'll tell you one
thing. That kid was stalked.

20:17.452 --> 20:20.253
Whoever took her knew
everything about her,

20:20.255 --> 20:22.288
- right down to her best friend's handle.
- Screen name.

20:22.290 --> 20:25.625
Okay, will you stop correcting
me and think about what it means?

20:25.627 --> 20:27.427
It means she was targeted.

20:27.429 --> 20:29.562
I mean, they knew her schedule
down to the very minute.

20:29.564 --> 20:31.765
They even got her to ditch her little
brother so they could get her alone.

20:31.767 --> 20:33.867
Still might be better
than a random snatch.

20:33.869 --> 20:35.268
How? Random, they kill her.

20:35.270 --> 20:36.803
This kind? They use her, abuse her,

20:36.805 --> 20:39.105
<i>like Jane Doe downstairs, then kill her.</i>

20:39.107 --> 20:40.940
I'm just saying it buys us some time.

20:40.942 --> 20:43.943
God, I hope so.

20:43.945 --> 20:46.780
Okay, we got a counterfeit
screen name -- suprgurrl97.

20:46.782 --> 20:49.582
Already trying to track it.

20:49.584 --> 20:52.018
Jane, I want to show you something.

20:55.924 --> 20:58.825
Blunt-force trauma to the
right side of the body.

20:58.827 --> 21:00.760
So her right side was facing her attacker.

21:00.762 --> 21:04.597
Yes, but there's no
bruising on her left side.

21:04.599 --> 21:07.734
Why is that significant? So
she was fighting like this.

21:07.736 --> 21:09.235
She was left-handed, Jane.

21:09.237 --> 21:10.737
Yeah. I'm left-handed.

21:10.739 --> 21:14.708
Why would I expose my weaker side,

21:14.710 --> 21:17.544
defend myself with my weaker right hand?

21:17.546 --> 21:19.112
Exactly. You wouldn't.

21:19.114 --> 21:21.815
Unless you were holding something...

21:21.817 --> 21:23.817
Or someone.

21:25.454 --> 21:26.820
The tears on the sweatshirt.

21:26.822 --> 21:29.723
She might have been holding someone close

21:29.725 --> 21:30.857
with her stronger arm

21:30.859 --> 21:32.692
as she fought off her attacker.

21:32.694 --> 21:36.930
It's Mandy. It --
it fits the timeline.

21:36.932 --> 21:38.698
Oh, God.

21:38.700 --> 21:41.534
She died trying to protect
a complete stranger.

21:41.536 --> 21:43.403
The DNA from the tears
will tell us if it's Mandy.

21:43.405 --> 21:45.238
Well, we don't have that kind of time.

21:45.240 --> 21:46.740
I mean, w-what about her other clothing?

21:46.742 --> 21:48.541
I mean, maybe there's something on that

21:48.543 --> 21:50.376
that connects this girl to Mandy.

21:50.378 --> 21:52.112
Everyone is working all night on this.

21:52.114 --> 21:54.247
I promised Dan that we'd find her.

21:54.249 --> 21:56.382
I know she's out there, okay?

21:56.384 --> 22:00.487
We can't let her end up like
this girl. We just can't.

22:00.489 --> 22:02.322
Got something, Dr. Isles.

22:02.324 --> 22:05.158
A positive match on the
hair we found on the jeans.

22:05.160 --> 22:07.727
- Who does it match?
- Amanda Mateo.

22:10.264 --> 22:13.633
She's alive, Maura. I know she is.

22:20.278 --> 22:22.049
So this guy looks online

22:22.169 --> 22:24.351
watching young girls chat with each other?

22:24.353 --> 22:25.919
Like shooting little fish in a barrel.

22:25.921 --> 22:28.522
They have no idea how vulnerable they are.

22:28.524 --> 22:30.323
Did you find this bastard online?

22:30.325 --> 22:32.626
- Who is he?
- We don't know yet.

22:33.694 --> 22:35.896
<i>Well, tell me what you do know, Jane,</i>

22:35.898 --> 22:37.898
because what I'm thinking in my head
is far worse than anything you can say.

22:37.900 --> 22:40.400
We know he was chatting
with Mandy for two days,

22:40.402 --> 22:42.569
- pretending to be Chloe.
- He knew her schedule.

22:42.571 --> 22:44.871
Did he know her dad wasn't around?

22:44.873 --> 22:46.873
Come on.

22:48.709 --> 22:51.111
Got an I.P. Address.

22:54.817 --> 22:58.018
It's a café with free
public Internet service.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.487
Public Internet service. Great.

23:00.489 --> 23:02.589
Wait. No. Washington street.

23:02.591 --> 23:04.424
That's -- that's like a quarter-mile
from where we found Jane Doe's body.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.461
<i>Got to be his stomping
ground. That's something, Dan.</i>

23:07.463 --> 23:09.663
It's not enough.

23:09.665 --> 23:12.265
- W-where you going?
- To find her.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.669
Let him go, Jane. He
needs something to do.

23:15.671 --> 23:16.870
<i>Where you going?</i>

23:16.872 --> 23:18.839
Check on Nicole.

23:18.841 --> 23:21.541
All right. Thanks.

23:21.543 --> 23:23.243
Hey, Maura, look for anything on Jane Doe

23:23.245 --> 23:26.580
that can narrow down a
location around Stony Brook.

23:26.582 --> 23:28.482
Okay, thanks.

23:38.726 --> 23:40.660
How about I give you and Joey a ride home?

23:40.662 --> 23:42.629
I'll call you the
second we have something.

23:42.631 --> 23:45.866
No! I'm not going anywhere until
you people find my daughter!

23:45.868 --> 23:47.968
Let me make you a cup of coffee.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.569
Thank you.

23:49.571 --> 23:52.806
Sorry, Vince. That was harsh.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.574
Nah, it's all right.

23:54.576 --> 23:57.277
- You can yell at me anytime you need to.
-  Mm.

23:57.279 --> 24:00.680
Dan blames me.

24:00.682 --> 24:04.584
<i>I blame me.</i>

24:04.586 --> 24:06.419
Where is he? Where is Dan?

24:06.421 --> 24:09.222
He's out in the streets, doing
what he does best, Nicole --

24:09.224 --> 24:12.359
- digging, looking for Amanda.
- That's what I want to do.

24:12.361 --> 24:15.362
I want to look for her.
I want to scream her name.

24:18.232 --> 24:21.668
I can't leave Joey, though.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.504
The job...

24:24.506 --> 24:26.506
It's crushed him...

24:26.508 --> 24:28.341
<i>Crushed me.</i>

24:28.343 --> 24:32.312
Hey, I've had three wives
leave me because of the job.

24:32.314 --> 24:34.481
It's hard being married to a cop.

24:34.483 --> 24:38.518
Dan just kept doing
deep-cover drug assignments,

24:38.520 --> 24:40.487
disappearing on us.

24:40.489 --> 24:42.622
The job was more important
to him than we were.

24:42.624 --> 24:44.558
That is not true, Nicole.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.493
It sucks you in.

24:46.495 --> 24:48.261
And it's who he is.

24:48.263 --> 24:49.796
Ah. I know.

24:51.265 --> 24:54.568
I just feel so alone all the time.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.636
I mean, even--

24:56.638 --> 24:58.838
Even before we split up, I
felt like a single mother,

24:58.840 --> 25:01.841
raising our kids without him.

25:01.843 --> 25:04.644
And I know that he loves them.

25:04.646 --> 25:06.246
<i>He loves you, too.</i>

25:08.483 --> 25:10.650
I made a fresh pot.

25:10.652 --> 25:12.252
Please eat.

25:12.254 --> 25:15.755
You've really been so kind.

25:15.757 --> 25:17.424
But you can go home.

25:17.426 --> 25:19.225
I'm not going anywhere.

25:19.227 --> 25:22.696
I'm part of a cop family, too.

25:27.468 --> 25:30.236
She has fluorosis
of the enamel --

25:30.238 --> 25:31.905
discoloration of her permanent teeth.

25:31.907 --> 25:34.240
She grew up in an area
with high concentrations

25:34.242 --> 25:35.875
of natural fluoride in the water.

25:35.877 --> 25:37.711
- Well water.
- Yes.

25:37.713 --> 25:40.647
So she's from a rural area
or a farming community maybe.

25:40.649 --> 25:43.149
Yeah, but we got to narrow
it down more than that.

25:43.151 --> 25:44.918
Frost has already been through over
a thousand missing-children reports.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.920
We'll start with Massachusetts.
Try Worcester County,

25:46.922 --> 25:48.488
Berkshire County, Hampshire County.

25:48.490 --> 25:51.291
Okay, slow down. Slow down. Uh...

25:53.629 --> 25:55.328
No missing kids in Worcester County

25:55.330 --> 25:57.597
matching Jane Doe's description.

25:57.599 --> 25:59.199
What are you doing?

25:59.201 --> 26:01.267
Checking water-quality reports

26:01.269 --> 26:03.770
in Massachusetts and surrounding States.

26:03.772 --> 26:07.240
Nothing in Hampshire
County or Berkshire County.

26:07.242 --> 26:09.109
Maybe if I narrow down
the search parameters

26:09.111 --> 26:13.480
to 1.4 milligrams per liter.

26:13.482 --> 26:15.015
Okay, that helps.

26:16.550 --> 26:18.718
Here it is. What about, uh,
Windham County, Connecticut?

26:18.720 --> 26:20.787
Windham County.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.722
Anything?

26:22.724 --> 26:26.226
Maybe. 13-year-old girl
disappeared four years ago.

26:26.228 --> 26:29.796
Maura, didn't you say she
was about 17 years old?

26:29.798 --> 26:32.132
- Frost, you got a picture?
- Right here.

26:32.134 --> 26:35.669
There she is. Sophie James.

26:35.671 --> 26:38.738
Sophie James.

26:38.740 --> 26:41.274
She's been missing four years.

26:41.276 --> 26:42.575
I'm gonna call her family,

26:42.577 --> 26:45.545
have them come get her and take her home.

26:52.353 --> 26:53.687
I'm so sorry.

26:53.689 --> 26:55.388
Don't be.

26:55.390 --> 26:57.424
Her mother and I have been
praying for a long time

26:57.426 --> 26:59.693
to get this phone call in
the middle of the night --

26:59.695 --> 27:01.194
just to know.

27:01.196 --> 27:05.365
It's hell...To not know.

27:05.367 --> 27:08.468
I understand.

27:16.877 --> 27:19.512
That's Sophie.

27:19.514 --> 27:22.649
That's my daughter.

27:24.452 --> 27:27.287
Can I go to her?

27:28.556 --> 27:30.523
Sure.

27:37.498 --> 27:40.667
I'm so sorry, Mr. James.

27:40.669 --> 27:43.369
Thank you.

27:46.240 --> 27:50.744
I've been carrying this
around for four years.

27:50.746 --> 27:54.280
It's her dental records...

27:54.282 --> 27:55.915
Photos.

28:00.554 --> 28:04.224
Where's she been? Who took my daughter?

28:04.226 --> 28:07.327
We don't know yet.

28:09.463 --> 28:11.364
I saw another family upstairs.

28:11.366 --> 28:13.666
They're missing a child, aren't they?

28:13.668 --> 28:16.369
Yes.

28:16.371 --> 28:18.505
A girl, 13.

28:19.640 --> 28:22.475
We, uh...

28:22.477 --> 28:24.644
Think your daughter might have been killed

28:24.646 --> 28:26.546
trying to protect that girl.

28:31.318 --> 28:35.522
That
sounds like my girl, Sophie.

28:37.893 --> 28:41.294
Find that girl, will you?

28:42.563 --> 28:45.031
Don't let those parents go through this.

29:06.702 --> 29:09.102
Anything?

29:09.104 --> 29:10.370
No, not yet.

29:10.372 --> 29:12.606
You were right. He just keeps on drawing.

29:14.442 --> 29:18.979
Oh, wow. I like how the waves
move against the lighthouse.

29:18.981 --> 29:21.548
Did your family take a vacation in Maine?

29:21.550 --> 29:23.016
My dad's always working.

29:23.018 --> 29:25.419
No. No, we've never been. Why?

29:25.421 --> 29:27.087
Well...

29:27.089 --> 29:30.390
I guess you like lighthouses, then, huh?

29:30.392 --> 29:33.093
Not really.

29:33.095 --> 29:36.096
Joey, let me see.

29:36.098 --> 29:38.599
<i>He is drawing a lot of lighthouses.</i>

29:38.601 --> 29:40.601
He's never done that before.

29:40.603 --> 29:42.269
Joey...

29:42.271 --> 29:45.272
Is this the car that took Mandy?

29:46.541 --> 29:48.008
Mm-hmm.

29:48.010 --> 29:49.576
Look at the smoke. What's the smoke from?

29:49.578 --> 29:52.646
- From the back of the car.
- Tailpipe.

29:52.648 --> 29:54.982
No, it's the muffler.

29:54.984 --> 29:57.150
Joey, d-did the car sound like,

29:57.152 --> 29:59.353
"pop-pop,
pop-pop," like that?

29:59.355 --> 30:00.420
Mm-hmm. It was loud.

30:00.422 --> 30:02.623
The car had a broken muffler.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.491
Uh, Nicole, can I borrow your laptop?

30:04.493 --> 30:07.027
Yes, of course.

30:07.029 --> 30:09.029
Well, maybe he saw the license plate,

30:09.031 --> 30:13.100
but he doesn't realize it.

30:15.037 --> 30:16.470
Okay.

30:16.472 --> 30:18.171
Did the blue car maybe have

30:18.173 --> 30:20.407
a Connecticut license
plate that looked like this?

30:23.411 --> 30:25.245
Yeah. Maybe.

30:28.483 --> 30:31.418
I'll let you know if we find something.

30:31.420 --> 30:33.654
Good job.

30:33.656 --> 30:37.157
Frost, track Connecticut vanity plates,

30:37.159 --> 30:38.558
the lighthouse ones.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.527
See how many were cited
for defective equipment

30:40.529 --> 30:42.129
in the last month.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.398
I think the kidnappers'
car had a bum muffler.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.199
<i>Think we're gonna find her on that?</i>

30:46.201 --> 30:48.402
Hey, they caught the son
of Sam on a parking ticket.

30:48.404 --> 30:49.736
State troopers are relentless

30:49.738 --> 30:51.738
on equipment-violation tickets.

30:51.740 --> 30:53.206
Found two -- a
2000 minivan...

30:53.208 --> 30:56.543
And an '89 Dodge Dynasty. It's blue, Jane.

30:56.545 --> 30:58.345
Who's it registered to?

30:58.347 --> 31:01.248
Heidi Rodman, 35.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.683
Show me her face.

31:06.421 --> 31:08.388
Where's Amanda?

31:10.191 --> 31:12.693
- You got the plate, Korsak?
- Yeah, putting out a BOLO on it.

31:12.695 --> 31:15.228
We'll have every cop in the
state on it in two seconds.

31:15.230 --> 31:17.297
Hey, put out a BOLO on
a Connecticut plate --

31:17.299 --> 31:19.499
936-Romeo-Zulu-Baker...

31:19.501 --> 31:21.101
Let's get all the locals
to her new London house.

31:21.103 --> 31:23.303
It's not gonna help.

31:23.305 --> 31:25.706
Why? Y-you've got her address
right there. 800 Harbor View Drive.

31:25.708 --> 31:27.708
It's bogus. The address
is to a shopping mall.

31:27.710 --> 31:30.610
Oh, damn it. Is she married?

31:32.046 --> 31:37.651
No marriage certificate
on file. No joint accounts.

31:37.653 --> 31:40.754
All right, print up her
driver's-license photo.

31:40.756 --> 31:42.255
I want to show that to Joey.

31:42.257 --> 31:44.624
You got it.

31:46.495 --> 31:49.496
Take your time.

31:54.268 --> 31:55.702
That's her.

31:57.238 --> 32:00.140
Great job, Joey. You did good.

32:00.142 --> 32:01.608
We're gonna get her.

32:05.213 --> 32:08.638
It's her. Joey made her.

32:08.758 --> 32:10.717
Yeah! Good.

32:10.719 --> 32:12.452
- Is that operations?
- Yeah.
- Korsak. What do you got?

32:12.454 --> 32:14.087
Come on, please.

32:14.089 --> 32:15.355
Okay. Thanks.

32:15.357 --> 32:17.124
Walking beat just spotted the car

32:17.126 --> 32:19.126
parked on river street in Stony Brook.

32:19.128 --> 32:21.161
Yes!

32:21.163 --> 32:24.264
Frost, call dispatch. Have the
walking beat keep an eye on that car.

32:24.266 --> 32:25.932
Keep everybody out of that area.

32:25.934 --> 32:29.002
We're gonna follow Heidi
Rodman straight to Amanda.

32:29.004 --> 32:30.203
Bring her home.

32:37.613 --> 32:39.079
There it is.

32:39.081 --> 32:40.647
Walking beat's keeping an eye on it.

32:40.649 --> 32:42.416
Have they spotted the driver yet?

32:42.418 --> 32:44.117
No.

32:44.119 --> 32:47.087
Well, then, we wait.

32:47.089 --> 32:48.922
And that car will take
us straight to Mandy.

32:56.098 --> 32:58.131
That's her.

33:05.007 --> 33:06.673
Oh, no! It's Martinez!

33:06.675 --> 33:09.242
Oh, no, no! Come on!
No! What is he doing?!

33:09.244 --> 33:11.244
God, no.

33:11.246 --> 33:14.681
Hands on the wheel! Let me see your hands!

33:14.683 --> 33:16.149
Ho! Hey! Ho!

33:16.151 --> 33:18.418
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

33:18.420 --> 33:20.153
She's wanted. There's
a BOLO out on this car.

33:20.155 --> 33:21.621
You don't listen to your damn radio?!

33:21.623 --> 33:23.557
Get out of the car!

33:23.559 --> 33:25.992
We called everybody off this location!

33:25.994 --> 33:27.227
Sorry.
I --

33:27.229 --> 33:30.997
where's Mandy? Where is she?!

33:30.999 --> 33:33.633
She's dead.

33:35.336 --> 33:38.071
Where is he? Where's he at?

33:38.073 --> 33:40.106
You should have let me go back.

33:40.108 --> 33:43.610
Amanda might still be alive
if you let me go back to him.

33:43.612 --> 33:44.778
He'll be mad.

33:46.347 --> 33:49.049
Look at this.

33:49.051 --> 33:51.551
Camera equipment. A lot of it.

33:56.290 --> 33:59.226
Oh, you a pornographer, too, Heidi?

34:00.928 --> 34:04.698
Oh, you're gonna talk to me.

34:11.339 --> 34:14.774
Sophie James. He stepped on her neck.

34:18.545 --> 34:19.980
Crushed her trachea.

34:19.982 --> 34:22.516
Did you watch him kill her?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.217
Help hold her down?

34:25.253 --> 34:27.786
Did you watch him do
the same thing to Mandy?

34:29.190 --> 34:32.058
He's a prophet.

34:32.060 --> 34:34.393
You can't understand.

34:37.098 --> 34:39.232
Let me in there!

34:39.234 --> 34:41.201
Hey! Let me in there!

34:41.203 --> 34:43.203
Where's my daughter?!
Where's my daughter?!

34:43.205 --> 34:45.672
You hear me, you bitch?!

34:45.674 --> 34:47.407
You killed my daughter!

34:49.110 --> 34:51.411
You killed her!

34:51.413 --> 34:53.380
Jane! I'm gonna kill her, Jane!

34:53.382 --> 34:56.349
Where's my daughter?!

34:56.351 --> 34:58.318
You know who that is?
That's Mandy's father.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.220
If you don't start talking, I'm gonna
open that door and let him in here.

35:00.222 --> 35:03.557
- Now, where is he?
- It's too late.

35:03.559 --> 35:07.928
You've angered the prophet.

35:07.930 --> 35:10.397
She's gone.

35:20.445 --> 35:23.513
Where's Dan?

35:23.515 --> 35:25.515
Thought we were gonna have to lock him up.

35:25.517 --> 35:28.051
He's downstairs with Nicole.
You guys get anything?

35:28.053 --> 35:29.286
No. Nothing.

35:29.288 --> 35:32.522
They're processing the
car. We'll get him, Jane.

35:34.025 --> 35:36.426
I kept her dental records,

35:36.428 --> 35:38.461
but here are Sophie's
photos for your case file.

35:38.463 --> 35:42.032
Crime techs are collecting
that piece of crap's clothing,

35:42.034 --> 35:44.167
checking for trace evidence.

35:48.139 --> 35:50.574
Hey, Frost, pull up Mandy's profile page.

35:55.513 --> 35:57.914
Look at that.

35:57.916 --> 35:59.749
Mandy and Sophie both played soccer.

36:01.185 --> 36:03.853
Is Mandy left-handed?

36:03.855 --> 36:05.855
- I don't know. Why?
- I think she is.

36:05.857 --> 36:08.358
Her left hand, the dominant
hand, is holding the soccer ball.

36:08.360 --> 36:09.526
Sophie was left-handed.

36:09.528 --> 36:11.428
Well, so, you're saying he's targeting

36:11.430 --> 36:13.063
left-handed soccer players?

36:13.065 --> 36:14.965
- Come on, Maura. That's just crazy.
- I don't know.

36:14.967 --> 36:16.499
The alphabet killer went after girls

36:16.501 --> 36:18.234
who had the same initial in
their first and last names.

36:18.236 --> 36:20.503
And there's a lot of mythology
associated with left-handedness

36:20.505 --> 36:23.239
that might trigger
something in a sociopath.

36:23.241 --> 36:25.909
The devil is often portrayed
as being left-handed.

36:25.911 --> 36:27.911
Yeah, but Mandy and Sophie
lived 100 miles apart.

36:27.913 --> 36:30.313
How would he know if they
were left- or right-handed?

36:30.315 --> 36:33.416
The soccer -- I mean, the
coach would know. Yeah, look.

36:33.418 --> 36:35.251
Mandy played left wing.

36:35.253 --> 36:38.054
Mandy and Sophie are four years
apart, from two different States.

36:38.056 --> 36:39.889
Those are official player photos.

36:39.891 --> 36:42.859
They're in the same position.

36:42.861 --> 36:44.961
No, wait. The camera
equipment in the trunk.

36:44.963 --> 36:47.931
He's a photographer.

36:47.933 --> 36:49.532
He takes pictures of kids.

36:50.901 --> 36:53.937
Maybe game world photography
took Mandy's team photos, too.

36:53.939 --> 36:55.805
- Could you check that?
- On it.

36:55.807 --> 36:57.374
No one ever notices the photographer.

36:57.376 --> 36:59.042
And he's around kids all the time.

36:59.044 --> 37:01.277
He keeps looking until
he finds the one he wants.

37:01.279 --> 37:02.746
Owen Lamb is the owner.

37:02.748 --> 37:05.215
Is Mandy's school team
on his list of clients?

37:05.217 --> 37:06.483
Yeah. Right here.

37:06.485 --> 37:09.653
Owen Lamb. 617 Atkins Road, Stony Brook.

37:09.655 --> 37:13.423
<i>Let's get him. If I can't bring Mandy
home alive, we're at least gonna get him.</i>

37:18.496 --> 37:21.131
Thank you, Sophie.

37:41.485 --> 37:44.054
Let's get this bastard.

38:08.846 --> 38:10.480
Tsst, tsst.

38:57.027 --> 39:00.029
Clear.

39:32.694 --> 39:34.627
Mandy. Oh, honey.

39:34.629 --> 39:37.130
Mandy. Oh, sweetie. You okay?

39:37.132 --> 39:40.266
It's all right. There. There we go.

39:40.268 --> 39:42.468
It's okay, honey. We'll get
you out of here, all right?

39:42.470 --> 39:45.271
Oh, your mommy and daddy are
gonna be so happy to see you, okay?

39:45.273 --> 39:49.208
All right? There. There, baby. It's okay.

39:49.210 --> 39:51.511
We're gonna get you home, all right?

39:51.513 --> 39:54.447
We're gonna get you out of
here. We're gonna get you home.

39:54.449 --> 39:56.449
Oh, honey, it's over.

40:04.558 --> 40:07.326
Who's that?

40:07.328 --> 40:08.861
Mom.

40:08.863 --> 40:10.730
Mandy.

40:10.732 --> 40:12.365
Oh, my sweet baby girl.

40:12.367 --> 40:15.601
Baby.
Are you okay?

40:15.603 --> 40:16.936
Let me see you.

40:16.938 --> 40:19.405
Daddy.

40:30.684 --> 40:34.520
<i>I am never getting married...</i>

40:34.522 --> 40:35.755
Or having children.

40:35.757 --> 40:38.357
You think that'll protect you?

40:38.359 --> 40:40.359
No.

40:40.361 --> 40:42.328
You're okay.

40:42.330 --> 40:44.530
You brought her back to me...

40:44.532 --> 40:46.365
Back to us.

40:47.467 --> 40:49.535
We all did.

40:49.537 --> 40:52.939
I'm never gonna be able to thank you.

40:52.941 --> 40:55.641
Yes, you can.

40:55.643 --> 40:57.410
Go back to your family.

40:57.412 --> 41:00.813
Thanks, partner.

41:00.815 --> 41:02.582
Maybe they'll get back together.

41:02.584 --> 41:04.317
Oh, God, I hope so.

41:04.319 --> 41:06.352
Bye.

41:07.487 --> 41:10.356
Bye, Mandy. Go home, baby.

41:17.664 --> 41:20.466
Well, that was a long day.

41:20.468 --> 41:22.802
<i>I guess 'cause it started yesterday.</i>

41:22.804 --> 41:24.804
<i>Now can we get a beer?</i>

41:24.806 --> 41:27.840
Really?

41:29.477 --> 41:32.578
You hear "beer," and your ears perk up?
