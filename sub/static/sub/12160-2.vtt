00:02.923 --> 00:05.925
Well, beautiful wife, beautiful night,

00:05.959 --> 00:08.210
great cup of coffee at
the end of the workday.

00:08.262 --> 00:09.545
- Nice.
- Couldn't be better.

00:09.596 --> 00:11.063
Dad!

00:11.098 --> 00:13.599
You never wanna get too happy.

00:13.634 --> 00:15.468
They sense it, then they just crush it.

00:16.853 --> 00:17.904
What?

00:17.938 --> 00:19.238
I'm meeting Travis at the mall.

00:19.273 --> 00:21.040
Can I have some money for java Jimmy's?

00:21.074 --> 00:22.942
Coffee? We got coffee right here.

00:22.976 --> 00:24.727
French press. Here.

00:24.778 --> 00:28.381
Taste Columbia's
second-largest cash crop.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.717
Oh! God, that's horrible.

00:31.752 --> 00:33.352
Hey! No. No.

00:33.387 --> 00:35.087
<i>That was my coffee.</i>

00:35.122 --> 00:37.924
So can I have $20, or...

00:37.958 --> 00:40.159
$20 for a cup of coffee?

00:40.193 --> 00:42.361
I'm a huge tipper. It's kind of my thing.

00:42.379 --> 00:43.829
I-I just feel so sorry

00:43.864 --> 00:46.232
for anybody that has to wear an apron.

00:46.266 --> 00:49.502
You ask me why I put
rum in here? This is why.

00:51.872 --> 00:54.840
If you want money, maybe you
should do what other people do.

00:54.908 --> 00:57.777
Get my own reality show. Dad, I'm trying.

00:57.811 --> 01:00.012
How about a part-time job?

01:00.047 --> 01:02.081
Job.

01:02.115 --> 01:03.883
Come on.

01:05.218 --> 01:07.053
Oh, my God. Are we poor?

01:08.255 --> 01:10.056
<i>You are.</i>

01:10.090 --> 01:12.325
We're doing very well.

01:13.827 --> 01:15.861
You sure about this?

01:15.896 --> 01:17.997
She's 16--
I'm 17, dad.

01:18.031 --> 01:20.199
17. She
should--

01:20.233 --> 01:21.901
she should think about getting her a job.

01:21.935 --> 01:23.619
Well, it's just easier to give her money.

01:23.670 --> 01:25.705
Well, we just can't be lazy with our kids.

01:25.739 --> 01:28.107
- We're better than that.
- Are we?

01:29.443 --> 01:32.578
<i>Mom! Dad!</i>

01:32.612 --> 01:34.847
Go, go. Go, go, go.

01:34.881 --> 01:36.132
You get it. You get it.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.651
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

01:43.557 --> 01:45.775
Aw, that's my boy.

01:46.977 --> 01:48.644
Hey, hey. Morning.

01:48.695 --> 01:50.596
- Hey, morning, guys.
. Morning, dad.

01:50.614 --> 01:52.765
Why do I smell French fries?

01:52.783 --> 01:55.167
Oh, that's the diner. I
always smell like work.

01:55.202 --> 01:57.987
Well, thank God you don't
work for a plumber.

01:58.038 --> 02:00.373
Ow.

02:00.407 --> 02:03.142
Mother...

02:03.176 --> 02:04.710
Father!

02:06.313 --> 02:07.813
Oh, that is so dangerous.

02:07.848 --> 02:09.799
Oh, I really whacked my shin.

02:09.833 --> 02:12.334
No, Boyd--he could have gotten
into those cleaning supplies.

02:12.386 --> 02:14.787
My tibia is throbbing.

02:14.821 --> 02:16.455
I'm seeing stars here.

02:16.490 --> 02:19.058
You know, we should baby-proof the house.

02:19.092 --> 02:21.160
You know, there's that
guy on tv that does it.

02:21.194 --> 02:23.479
Oh, I know who you mean. He's
all over the Internet, too.

02:23.513 --> 02:25.164
There's some clicking
come from inside my knee.

02:25.198 --> 02:27.933
Can you hear that? Listen.

02:27.968 --> 02:29.635
Found him.

02:30.737 --> 02:32.171
<i>Hi, folks.</i>

02:32.205 --> 02:33.506
<i>Bet you didn't know that
if you have children,</i>

02:33.540 --> 02:35.107
<i>your house is a deadly time bomb,</i>

02:35.142 --> 02:36.575
<i>waiting to explode...</i>

02:38.178 --> 02:39.995
<i>stairs--peril!</i>

02:40.030 --> 02:43.649
<i>Why, even the tv you're
watching right now...</i>

02:43.667 --> 02:46.202
<i>In fact, in the time since this ad began,</i>

02:46.253 --> 02:48.320
<i>six more tots have tried
to eat something larger</i>

02:48.338 --> 02:49.839
<i>than their own esophagus.</i>

02:49.873 --> 02:51.957
<i>Come on!</i>

02:51.992 --> 02:54.660
<i>Come on!</i>

02:54.694 --> 02:55.928
<i>Poor boo-boo Bobby.</i>

02:55.962 --> 02:57.363
<i>Don't let this be you.</i>

02:57.397 --> 02:59.949
<i>Instead, call me, Chester McAllister,</i>

02:59.983 --> 03:02.034
<i>advanced child-proofing expert.</i>

03:02.069 --> 03:03.969
<i>We worry so you don't have to.</i>

03:04.004 --> 03:05.204
<i>Trademark pending.</i>

03:06.556 --> 03:09.024
Certified baby-proofer?
How is that a job?

03:09.059 --> 03:11.844
You don't think any job's
a job unless it's your job.

03:11.878 --> 03:15.147
I'm just saying, you don't need
a professional to baby-proof.

03:15.182 --> 03:16.749
Don't want him in that
little cupboard down there,

03:16.783 --> 03:18.250
you use one of these.

03:18.285 --> 03:21.620
It's called a rubber band.

03:21.655 --> 03:23.222
You move--

03:23.256 --> 03:25.291
You hear that clicking?

03:26.726 --> 03:28.410
Huh?

03:28.462 --> 03:30.362
Loop it a couple times
around there like that...

03:30.397 --> 03:31.997
Baby-proof.

03:32.031 --> 03:34.333
That's what your mom and I
did when you guys were kids.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.869
Yeah, we only had to
call poison control twice.

03:36.903 --> 03:38.754
Yeah. Once was your mom's potato salad.

03:38.805 --> 03:40.506
Oh, I'm so sick of hearing
about that potato salad.

03:40.540 --> 03:42.241
I lost a quart of water that day.

03:42.275 --> 03:44.376
- You never liked my mother.
- That's 'cause she tried to kill us.

03:44.394 --> 03:47.012
No, I-- potato salad,
mayonnaise-- the point is...

03:47.047 --> 03:49.181
You kids turned out fine.

03:49.215 --> 03:50.382
Well, fine-ish.

03:50.417 --> 03:52.718
<i>Look at you, first day of work.</i>

03:52.736 --> 03:54.436
I still don't get why
I have to have a job.

03:54.488 --> 03:55.888
It's so unfair!

03:55.906 --> 03:57.239
Oh, you're gonna be selling clothes.

03:57.274 --> 03:58.657
You love clothes, and you
get to work at the mall.

03:58.692 --> 04:00.059
You love the mall.

04:00.093 --> 04:01.410
I think it's good you're getting a job.

04:01.444 --> 04:03.228
You treat dad like an A.T.M.

04:03.246 --> 04:06.565
Yes, and I'm not an
A.T.M. You know how I know?

04:06.583 --> 04:08.400
I only speak English.

04:08.418 --> 04:10.736
That's a good one, dad.

04:10.754 --> 04:12.204
Ah, here's $20.

04:12.238 --> 04:13.906
Whoa. Hey, why doesn't she have to work?

04:13.924 --> 04:16.809
'Cause I don't need money.
I've got everything I want.

04:16.843 --> 04:19.411
In fact, here, dad.

04:19.428 --> 04:20.846
I insist.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.415
Wouldn't even know what to do with it.

04:23.450 --> 04:25.985
Ugh!

04:26.019 --> 04:27.937
I'll take that $20 now.

04:27.971 --> 04:30.756
You earned it.

04:32.576 --> 04:35.561
Mike, come here. This new
tracking device is great.

04:35.595 --> 04:37.796
It pinpoints your hunting dog's
position and speed... yeah.

04:37.831 --> 04:39.114
Every five seconds.

04:39.149 --> 04:40.699
Look, the little bugger's
moving pretty fast

04:40.734 --> 04:43.235
through the brush out back.
Look at that. Look at that.

04:43.270 --> 04:45.270
Whose dog is that? And why
is it coming in the building?

04:45.288 --> 04:47.373
Oh, yeah, you'll soon see

04:47.407 --> 04:49.842
he should be coming through that door

04:49.876 --> 04:52.294
in three, two, and...

04:55.281 --> 04:57.149
Oh.

04:57.184 --> 05:01.620
Huh? What do you think?
Ah, look at that.

05:01.638 --> 05:04.640
That's a good trial run,
Kyle. Good trial run.

05:04.674 --> 05:06.642
I'm starting to think
you're only keeping me around

05:06.676 --> 05:09.195
for these humiliating jobs.

05:09.229 --> 05:12.648
Ed, Ed, Ed, this is the kind
of stuff you get sued for, Ed.

05:12.682 --> 05:13.966
Come on, Mike.

05:13.984 --> 05:16.969
Hazing the new guy is
a male rite of passage.

05:16.987 --> 05:18.237
Now when I was a grunt in the service,

05:18.271 --> 05:20.823
they tied me to a tree with a garden hose.

05:20.857 --> 05:22.358
Big deal.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.343
The tree was on fire.

05:26.580 --> 05:28.781
They put it out with urine.

05:30.700 --> 05:33.318
Daddy?

05:33.336 --> 05:36.321
- Daddy.
-  Hey. Aren't you supposed to be at work?

05:36.339 --> 05:39.058
Yeah, it's my lunch break.
Hey, can you front me $500?

05:39.092 --> 05:41.627
No. Get in there.

05:44.497 --> 05:46.332
There was a workplace accident.

05:46.366 --> 05:47.800
What happened?

05:47.834 --> 05:48.934
I accidentally used my employee discount

05:48.969 --> 05:51.503
to buy a lot of cute clothes.

05:51.538 --> 05:54.673
This isn't the right job for you.

05:54.708 --> 05:57.810
That's so weird. That's
exactly what my manager said.

05:57.844 --> 06:00.045
Mike,
you gotta see this.

06:00.080 --> 06:03.148
I've got Kyle chasing a delivery truck!

06:09.454 --> 06:11.455
Hi. Hey, honey.

06:11.490 --> 06:14.175
Why is there a van out front
that says "Safe Havens"?

06:14.209 --> 06:16.177
Are we having an intervention?

06:16.211 --> 06:20.464
You got me. I turned your
office into a meth lab.

06:20.515 --> 06:23.251
It's the baby-proofing guy.
He's here for a consultation.

06:23.285 --> 06:26.470
- I know who it is. It's that huckster from tv.
- Shh! He's...

06:26.521 --> 06:28.256
I can't believe you'd invite
him over here without asking me.

06:28.290 --> 06:30.474
I made the appointment.
And I brought home pie.

06:30.525 --> 06:32.326
You can't distract me

06:32.361 --> 06:34.528
with a very warm, delicious-looking pie.

06:34.563 --> 06:37.265
Let's just hear what this guy has to say.

06:37.299 --> 06:38.766
You all heard what he had to say.

06:38.784 --> 06:40.234
What if I promise we won't do anything

06:40.268 --> 06:41.969
unless we're both on board?

06:42.004 --> 06:43.571
Oh, this is like we're not
gonna buy a floral comforter

06:43.605 --> 06:45.139
unless we're both on board.

06:45.173 --> 06:47.541
It's not floral. It's paisley.

06:47.576 --> 06:51.579
Flowers that are shaped
like sperm are still flowers.

06:53.548 --> 06:55.449
Are you gonna participate or not?

06:55.467 --> 06:56.968
Or not. I'll be in my office looking

06:57.002 --> 07:00.021
at Russian mail order
brides to replace you.

07:01.289 --> 07:04.759
Don't put me down as a reference.

07:06.662 --> 07:09.664
Do you know there's no
greater killing machine

07:09.698 --> 07:11.766
than the coffee table?

07:14.369 --> 07:16.537
<i>I like to call it the coffin table.</i>

07:24.579 --> 07:26.530
Okay, who here has electrical outlets?

07:26.581 --> 07:28.582
Show of hands.

07:34.423 --> 07:35.856
Wow. That's a lot.

07:37.175 --> 07:38.993
Now imagine this.

07:39.011 --> 07:40.361
You're 2 years old,

07:40.395 --> 07:41.879
and you wanna make a deposit in the bank,

07:41.930 --> 07:45.499
so you take your penny, and you
put it in the electrical socket.

07:45.534 --> 07:47.234
Oh, for crap's sake.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.738
Mike, you said you
didn't wanna participate.

07:50.772 --> 07:52.139
Well, you know what I'm
doing? I'm on the Internet.

07:52.174 --> 07:55.009
I'm just looking for
stories... about children...

07:55.043 --> 07:58.879
You know, that put coins
in electric outlets.

07:58.914 --> 08:02.216
<i>You know the weird
thing? There aren't any!</i>

08:03.785 --> 08:04.986
Look, I'm really sorry about him.

08:05.020 --> 08:06.821
He's just angry because...

08:08.223 --> 08:10.190
Well, we don't really know why.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.127
Please, no apologies. As
my grandfather used to say,

08:13.161 --> 08:16.163
ignorance is the devil's whoopee cushion.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.567
You know what? I bet my grandfather

08:19.601 --> 08:23.270
gave your grandfather
wedgies in high school.

08:25.107 --> 08:27.575
Whoa! Someone's got a hot head.

08:27.609 --> 08:30.478
Quick fact--children raised
in volatile households

08:30.512 --> 08:33.614
have three times the rate
of accidental dismemberments.

08:33.648 --> 08:35.982
Based on your statistics,

08:36.018 --> 08:40.121
150% of kids under the
age of 4 are dead already.

08:41.256 --> 08:43.624
Not on my watch.

08:44.860 --> 08:46.227
This bannister

08:46.261 --> 08:48.412
is a terrible accident waiting to happen.

08:48.447 --> 08:50.931
A child could get his head stuck.

08:50.966 --> 08:53.417
His head stuck.

08:53.452 --> 08:55.069
That can't happen.

08:55.087 --> 08:57.404
Honey, uh, maybe we should
discuss this privately.

08:57.422 --> 08:58.923
What's to discuss?

08:58.957 --> 09:01.258
I know. I think we should just do it.

09:01.293 --> 09:02.543
What happened to "we won't decide anything

09:02.577 --> 09:05.079
unless both of us say "yes"? "Yes." "No."

09:05.113 --> 09:06.113
I-I know, but I changed my mind.

09:06.148 --> 09:07.481
Look, this guy has gotten into my head.

09:07.516 --> 09:10.684
Apparently, there's peril...
Everywhere!

09:10.719 --> 09:12.586
He can make everything seem perilous.

09:12.621 --> 09:13.854
I mean, what if that painting fell off

09:13.889 --> 09:16.190
and decapitated the
kid? That stool

09:16.224 --> 09:17.625
could come alive and
go up and suffocate him.

09:17.659 --> 09:18.859
What if the kid swallowed

09:18.894 --> 09:21.128
one of those ugly throw pillows?

09:21.163 --> 09:25.032
Uh, a little help.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.767
What are you doing?

09:26.785 --> 09:29.870
I was trying to help
prove your point, Mr. B.

09:29.905 --> 09:32.973
Don't help. Hey, Kyle,

09:33.008 --> 09:34.408
once you get your head out of there,

09:34.443 --> 09:37.011
I'm gonna tie you to a
tree with a garden hose.

09:38.647 --> 09:40.381
I think you both know
what happens after that.

09:46.715 --> 09:47.898
Ugh.

09:47.932 --> 09:49.917
That baby-proof er made
a mess of everything.

09:49.951 --> 09:51.885
I'm gonna have to burn this house down

09:51.920 --> 09:53.237
and start all over
again. There's no way...

09:55.890 --> 09:58.425
I loosened it.

09:58.476 --> 10:00.644
Ah, Boyd can't open it either.

10:00.679 --> 10:02.429
- Hey, get in the car.
- Bye, dad.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.648
Bye-bye. You're just acting
stupid to make a point,

10:04.683 --> 10:06.266
but it's not gonna work.

10:06.318 --> 10:08.402
Some baby-proofing was necessary.

10:08.436 --> 10:11.188
Deal with it. Bye.

10:11.222 --> 10:13.357
You're gonna try to get a kiss
after saying "deal with it"?

10:13.391 --> 10:15.225
Come here.

10:15.260 --> 10:18.062
- But only because there's some butter left on your lips.
- Yeah.

10:20.898 --> 10:22.499
Well, dad, time for me to file

10:22.534 --> 10:24.752
for a little something
called unemployment.

10:24.786 --> 10:26.120
All right, you're not unemployed.

10:26.171 --> 10:28.789
I got you a new job doing
something I used to love to do--

10:28.840 --> 10:30.924
delivering pizzas.

10:30.959 --> 10:34.094
Ooh, I'm a food handler?
But what about my dignity?

10:36.247 --> 10:37.715
You know what a great philosopher

10:37.749 --> 10:39.583
once said about dignity?

10:39.617 --> 10:41.919
No, okay, never mind.
I'll just do it. It's fine.

10:41.953 --> 10:45.422
A man's hands may be dirty...
Oh, my God. Please open.

10:45.457 --> 10:47.024
But if his heart is pure...

10:47.058 --> 10:48.692
Oh, my God.

10:54.649 --> 10:57.601
Hey, Mike Baxter here for outdoor man.

10:57.635 --> 10:59.820
It's our blade of the month.

10:59.871 --> 11:02.790
The Sog S.E.A.L. Elite
series. Neoprene handle.

11:02.824 --> 11:05.409
This is modeled after the
one the Navy S.E.A.L.S. use.

11:05.443 --> 11:06.677
Those are tough S.O.B.S, aren't they?

11:06.711 --> 11:08.746
The Navy S.E.A.L.S. You know why?

11:08.780 --> 11:10.164
'Cause when they fall down,

11:10.215 --> 11:13.083
their parents probably said, "get up!"

11:14.552 --> 11:17.287
Not the rest of us. We
baby-proof our lives now.

11:17.305 --> 11:18.338
That eliminates the chance

11:18.390 --> 11:19.790
of surviving and adapting to things.

11:19.808 --> 11:22.459
Ol' Chuck Darwin would be rolling over

11:22.477 --> 11:25.162
in that wooden casket they
put him in the ground in.

11:25.196 --> 11:27.598
You wanna teach your kids how to survive?

11:27.632 --> 11:29.299
That's your job as a parent.

11:29.334 --> 11:30.868
Your kid can speak Spanish?

11:30.902 --> 11:32.519
Great. Chinese? Perfect!

11:32.570 --> 11:34.605
Poetry? Perfect!

11:34.639 --> 11:35.906
You wanna teach 'em how to survive,

11:35.940 --> 11:37.775
how about jumping from the garage roof

11:37.809 --> 11:40.778
into the pool on a skateboard, huh?!

11:40.812 --> 11:44.782
Or better yet, riding a
bicycle down a hill backwards,

11:44.816 --> 11:46.550
fighting off other kids with their hands.

11:46.584 --> 11:48.118
You teach that kid how to survive,

11:48.152 --> 11:51.088
you've done your job
as a parent! A parent!

11:51.122 --> 11:52.322
That kid will be able to fend off

11:52.340 --> 11:53.957
anything that comes his way!

11:53.992 --> 11:57.795
Like that Jason Bourne character
we all like so much, huh?

11:59.097 --> 12:00.330
What?!

12:03.001 --> 12:05.669
Little louder than usual, Mike, huh?

12:05.703 --> 12:07.471
Am I?

12:07.505 --> 12:09.506
Mm. Everything okay?

12:09.541 --> 12:13.944
Nah. They're baby-proofing
my house 'cause of Boyd.

12:13.978 --> 12:15.446
I think somebody trimmed my fingernails

12:15.480 --> 12:17.080
while I was sleeping.

12:17.115 --> 12:19.283
Well, they should have
painted them pink, too,

12:19.317 --> 12:21.418
because you're living like a lady.

12:21.453 --> 12:24.221
Come on. Don't start.

12:24.255 --> 12:26.156
Ah, it's too late. I've started.

12:26.190 --> 12:27.991
Baby-proofing. Come on.

12:28.025 --> 12:29.593
Bumps and bruises are how you learn.

12:29.627 --> 12:30.911
Yeah.

12:30.962 --> 12:32.329
- Yeah, you bang your head, you learn what?
- Yeah.

12:32.363 --> 12:34.164
- You learn not to bang your head.
- Your head.

12:34.198 --> 12:35.532
Simple. You stick your hand in a fire...

12:35.567 --> 12:38.202
- Ouch!
- You learn not to stick your hand in the fire.

12:38.236 --> 12:40.003
Bumps and bruises
and scar tissue--

12:40.038 --> 12:41.472
that's how you grow. I mean...

12:41.506 --> 12:46.243
Yes, yes, but... like that big,
ugly knot in your head there, huh?

12:46.277 --> 12:48.378
That's a--got that
in the service, right?

12:48.413 --> 12:51.348
I don't want to talk about that.

12:51.382 --> 12:53.116
I can respect that.

12:53.151 --> 12:54.585
Thank you.

13:01.359 --> 13:04.461
Was it, you know, the
shrapnel or something?

13:04.496 --> 13:06.563
A-an ammo dump go up?
What, a little P.O.W.?

13:06.598 --> 13:08.565
What happened?

13:08.600 --> 13:10.133
Leaned over to tie my shoe

13:10.168 --> 13:13.070
and banged my head on the coffee table.

13:13.104 --> 13:14.905
Come on, they...

13:14.939 --> 13:17.541
They had coffee tables in the jungle?

13:17.575 --> 13:20.043
I was stationed on the beach.

13:20.077 --> 13:23.647
Nice, little French colonial house.

13:23.681 --> 13:25.248
Well, what about that scar on your leg

13:25.266 --> 13:26.884
you always show everybody?

13:26.918 --> 13:31.922
Commanding officer
left a file drawer open.

13:31.956 --> 13:34.892
You said you got shot.

13:34.926 --> 13:38.829
<i>I got a shot.</i>

13:38.863 --> 13:40.731
Tetanus.

13:40.765 --> 13:44.601
Those metal file drawers
are filthy. I mean...

13:46.437 --> 13:48.705
What about that limp
you get when it rains?

13:48.740 --> 13:50.941
Really hoping for a combat story.

13:50.975 --> 13:54.244
Prepare to be disappointed.

13:56.147 --> 13:58.115
Evie, I just got a weird text from Mandy.

13:58.149 --> 14:00.167
It says she's "slinging 'zas."

14:00.218 --> 14:03.587
What? Is that code for something
that makes me a bad mother?

14:03.621 --> 14:07.457
No clue. I-I don't speak Mandy.

14:07.492 --> 14:09.626
It means I got her a
job delivering pizzas.

14:09.644 --> 14:11.762
To strangers?

14:13.264 --> 14:15.599
No, just to us.

14:15.633 --> 14:17.968
I mean, isn't that dangerous?

14:17.986 --> 14:19.736
Why don't you just get
her the graveyard shift

14:19.771 --> 14:21.872
at a liquor store?

14:21.906 --> 14:24.024
'Cause she's not old enough?

14:25.877 --> 14:28.011
Baby, delivering pizza's not dangerous.

14:28.046 --> 14:31.014
- I did it as a kid.
- I thought we weren't gonna do anything

14:31.049 --> 14:32.699
unless we both said "yes." "No."

14:32.750 --> 14:34.368
Why are you so against this?

14:34.419 --> 14:36.203
Because you were a boy.

14:36.254 --> 14:39.122
Mandy is a girl-- an
attractive teenage girl

14:39.156 --> 14:41.425
showing up at strangers' houses,

14:41.459 --> 14:45.562
one of which might--might
have a cage in the basement.

14:45.597 --> 14:48.532
Your world view saddens me.

14:48.566 --> 14:53.036
It's a good neighborhood. I
have no concerns about this.

14:53.071 --> 14:56.339
Why are we following Mandy in my van?

14:56.357 --> 14:58.842
Because, you idiot, if she sees my truck,

14:58.860 --> 15:00.377
she'll know it's me.

15:00.411 --> 15:02.646
Gotta follow her, but not too close.

15:02.680 --> 15:04.348
She's going right. Stay with her.

15:04.382 --> 15:07.517
Right, right, right, right,
right.

15:07.535 --> 15:09.286
This is horrible. I want
her to be independent,

15:09.320 --> 15:11.571
but I want her to be safe.

15:13.091 --> 15:15.926
How do you protect 'em and
let 'em go at the same time?

15:15.960 --> 15:17.728
I think that
it's important--

15:17.762 --> 15:20.063
Kyle, I'm not talking to you right now.

15:20.098 --> 15:21.431
I'm just pondering deep thoughts,

15:21.466 --> 15:25.552
and your presence here just
makes it slightly less weird.

15:25.586 --> 15:28.438
I think you should just tell
Mandy this was a bad idea

15:28.473 --> 15:30.407
and that she needs to quit.

15:30.441 --> 15:32.142
I don't...

15:32.176 --> 15:35.445
Oh, dear, sweet, innocent, ignorant Kyle.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.114
You know, I remember when I was your age.

15:37.148 --> 15:40.083
When you're young, everything's possible,

15:40.118 --> 15:41.752
even admitting you're wrong

15:41.786 --> 15:44.237
to a household filled with women.

15:50.783 --> 15:51.900
Hey. Hi.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.351
We're taking Boyd out for frozen yogurt

15:53.386 --> 15:55.670
as an excuse to get frozen yogurt.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.971
You wanna come?

15:57.006 --> 15:58.506
Nah, your dad's out,

15:58.541 --> 16:00.442
and I'm going to have a glass of wine

16:00.476 --> 16:02.560
and watch some trashy show
that he would just ruin

16:02.611 --> 16:05.864
by shouting, "that would never happen."

16:05.898 --> 16:08.733
Yeah, try watching cartoons with him.

16:27.036 --> 16:28.670
Ugh!

16:28.704 --> 16:31.773
Stupid peril.

16:36.846 --> 16:39.547
You drive like an old woman.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.717
That's
it. I'll wear a collar.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.218
I'll run around like a dog.

16:44.236 --> 16:46.488
I'll even be mocked for getting
my head stuck in a bannister,

16:46.522 --> 16:48.189
which could've happened to anyone.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.759
But in this castle, I am the King.

16:50.793 --> 16:53.228
The King!

16:59.368 --> 17:00.835
Can we make this light?

17:00.870 --> 17:02.337
Yes, sir.

17:05.273 --> 17:10.310
It's just, sometimes I feel
like you don't respect me.

17:10.346 --> 17:13.681
Kyle, I'm letting you date my daughter.

17:13.715 --> 17:16.785
In my world, that's the
highest form of respect.

17:18.854 --> 17:21.388
I didn't think of it that way.

17:22.858 --> 17:24.358
You know, maybe the silver lining

17:24.393 --> 17:26.928
of us following Mandy is that
we'll get to know each other

17:26.962 --> 17:30.331
on a deeper level.

17:30.366 --> 17:32.100
I've never told anyone
this before, Mr. B.,

17:32.134 --> 17:34.002
but I've always
dreamed that after--

17:34.036 --> 17:37.238
Kyle, do I look like your diary?

17:38.991 --> 17:41.826
Wait a minute. Wait a
minute. She's pulling over.

17:41.877 --> 17:44.179
Right there, right there. Slow
down, slow down, slow down.

17:53.956 --> 17:55.690
I'm gonna go in and take a look.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.059
I want you to keep the motor running.

17:58.093 --> 17:59.828
Don't make a sound.

18:01.597 --> 18:03.565
You are the worst sidekick ever.

18:07.102 --> 18:12.640
<i>Skyler F., will you accept this rose?</i>

18:12.675 --> 18:14.342
<i>You know I will.</i>

18:14.376 --> 18:18.163
Skyler F., you never learn.

18:18.197 --> 18:21.282
Aah! Oh, boy.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.670
Oh.

18:53.616 --> 18:55.116
Oh, boy.

19:06.695 --> 19:09.931
Creep! Aah! Mother...

19:11.467 --> 19:12.634
So what happened again?

19:12.668 --> 19:16.137
What aren't you getting here, honey?

19:16.171 --> 19:17.422
Our daughter thought I was a stalker,

19:17.473 --> 19:19.741
so she sprayed mace in my face...

19:19.775 --> 19:21.175
With...

19:21.210 --> 19:22.977
Such speed and accuracy.

19:23.012 --> 19:26.347
I'm actually quite proud of you.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.183
I-I know you want me to
follow in your footsteps,

19:29.217 --> 19:30.652
but do you mind if I find another job?

19:30.686 --> 19:33.688
You know, smelling like food
is kind of Kristin's thing.

19:33.722 --> 19:35.189
No, I think it's
a good idea--

19:35.223 --> 19:36.608
- Daddy.
- Hmm?

19:36.659 --> 19:38.943
- Oh. I think it's a good idea to get another job.
- Yeah.

19:38.994 --> 19:42.397
But not driving. You're a--
you're a hazard out there.

19:42.431 --> 19:43.698
Ugh. You sound like the crossing guard

19:43.732 --> 19:46.200
near my school.

19:46.235 --> 19:49.921
Hey, thank you for stalking me.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.957
That's what dads are for.

19:53.008 --> 19:55.610
Guess who peed in the kiddie potty?!

20:05.754 --> 20:06.988
Boyd!

20:07.022 --> 20:10.091
Yeah, of course! Boyd.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.760
Yeah, who else would it be?

20:12.795 --> 20:14.312
Yay.

20:14.363 --> 20:17.198
Oh! I'm so proud of him. I'm
gonna go get my camera! Good idea.

20:17.232 --> 20:19.400
And then I'm throwing way all his diapers!

20:19.434 --> 20:23.338
Uh... maybe hang on to a... couple!

20:27.409 --> 20:29.310
Uh, you know, you, uh,

20:29.345 --> 20:31.746
you might have been right
about the baby-proofing.

20:31.780 --> 20:33.548
I was right?

20:33.582 --> 20:36.951
Yeah. I know. I'm as stunned as you.

20:38.087 --> 20:39.453
It's bringing tears to my eyes,

20:39.471 --> 20:41.723
and I don't think it's just the mace.

20:41.757 --> 20:44.993
But you were wrong
about the pizza delivery.

20:45.027 --> 20:46.194
Well, you were more wrong.

20:46.228 --> 20:47.328
What, are you keeping score?

20:47.363 --> 20:49.897
No, but if I was, it'd be 14-7.

20:49.932 --> 20:52.100
Oh.

20:52.134 --> 20:55.269
The point is, we need to
decide things together. Mm-hmm.

20:55.304 --> 20:57.605
And we went a little nuts with
the whole baby-proofing thing.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.607
So, uh, if you're on board,

20:59.642 --> 21:02.493
I think we should just dial it back.

21:02.528 --> 21:03.978
What about Kristin?

21:04.013 --> 21:05.546
Ugh!

21:05.581 --> 21:09.417
Mother-father! Nothing opens around here!

21:09.451 --> 21:11.753
I think she'll be okay with it.

21:11.787 --> 21:14.355
Uh-huh. Yeah.
