16:35.411 --> 16:38.244
Wow. For best friends,
we are rarely on the same page.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.780
Yeah. I will get you back
your half of the rent,

16:41.083 --> 16:42.539
plus more from all my sweet,
sweet fares.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.371
And I'm gonna be the boss
from day one,

16:44.670 --> 16:47.503
calling all the shots
just like Tony Danza.

16:47.798 --> 16:51.382
Uh, Max, you know the customer
usually gets to decide

16:51.677 --> 16:52.792
when and where they're going.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.506
Ah, that's debatable.
Not debatable.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.716
That's how it works.
Everything's debatable.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.007
I'm gonna go around O'Hare
and see what shakes out.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.471
You need
to be specially licensed

17:00.770 --> 17:02.352
and bonded for that.

17:02.647 --> 17:05.765
You do and you don't, bro.
Believe in me.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.933
| believe in you.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.943

17:16.410 --> 17:17.491
[240]

17:22.791 --> 17:24.407
Okay. Come on, Tanner.
Let's get a move on.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.700
You wanna see it?

17:26.002 --> 17:27.585
[SIGHS]
Go home.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.632
What are you doing here?
| brought you Sbarros

17:32.927 --> 17:34.338
to say I'm "sborry.”

17:34.637 --> 17:36.219
| can't believe you ditched me
in the middle

17:36.514 --> 17:38.130
of an underage free-for-all
to go to the mall

17:38.432 --> 17:39.718
with Chloe and the Madisons.
| know.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.633
It was totally uncool of me.

17:41.936 --> 17:43.176
And halfway through,
| was like,

17:43.479 --> 17:45.516
"What am I doing
with these girls?

17:45.815 --> 17:46.805
| got my own girls.”

17:47.108 --> 17:49.065
Aww. They ditched you too?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.976
So hard.
And just like seconds

17:51.279 --> 17:52.735
after I bought them
all BFF necklaces.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.987
Mean girls.
Right. Are we happy to hear?

17:55.283 --> 17:56.444
Billy Garrity, fat and bald.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.574
He is?
No, smoking hot.

17:58.869 --> 18:01.577
But it turns out,
still only dates college girls.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.988
Hmm.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.454
Hi. I'm-- I'm so sorry.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.993
| know it was wrong to follow
her, but I was trying to help.

18:09.297 --> 18:12.005
And who are you?
Jane Kerkovich, your egg donor.

18:12.300 --> 18:13.836
And when I saw Jul--

18:14.135 --> 18:16.627
Dora going down a bad path,
| just--

18:16.929 --> 18:18.840
| felt I needed to protect her.
| mean, it's biology.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.551
We have
this profound connection--

18:20.850 --> 18:23.012
She's not yours.
| know, but in a primal sense--

18:23.311 --> 18:24.472
Not in any sense.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.260
Not your egg.
Excuse me?

18:26.564 --> 18:30.023
We didn't use it.
And we loved your donor video.

18:30.318 --> 18:31.274
But we were a little thrown

18:31.569 --> 18:33.105
by your unsolicited
follow-up video.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.690
Hey, guys.
So I've been thinking

18:34.989 --> 18:36.320
a little bit more
about our baby.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.947
| feel like there
are a few things

18:38.242 --> 18:39.858
| failed to mention
in the first video.

18:40.161 --> 18:44.405
One, nutrition. Two, schooling.
Two A, preschooling.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.618
Two B, or not to be...

18:46.917 --> 18:48.658
[LAUGHING]
Sorry, just a little--

18:48.961 --> 18:50.918
A little Shakespeare joke,

18:51.213 --> 18:52.248
which brings us
to the arts.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.289
You seemed a little crazy.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.878
And not fun crazy.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.542
The kind of crazy
that would come back

18:57.845 --> 18:58.801
after 11 years

18:59.096 --> 19:00.632
and try to lure my daughter
into a van.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.216
Think we're done here.
Yes, we are.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.475
Okay.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.637
[240]

19:08.939 --> 19:10.805
JANE: So I'm going
to be a terrible mother

19:11.108 --> 19:13.349
because I have zero maternal
instinct.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.394
Are you kidding?
You're gonna be an amazing mom.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.357
You did all that for a kid
who's not even yours.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.273
Well, for what it's worth
your mom instincts

19:19.575 --> 19:21.065
were right on with Chloe
and the Madisons.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.734
They were the worst.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.323
| don't know,
| kind of liked Madison.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.783
It's Madison
who's a total bitch.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.494
Ugh.
Anyway,

19:28.793 --> 19:29.954
I'm glad
they didn't use your egg,

19:30.252 --> 19:31.367
because one day,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.082
we're gonna have
a little Jane of our own

19:33.381 --> 19:35.964
and I want it to be
the only one out there.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.214
ALL: Aww.
Come here.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.752
Boom! Rent. Eat it.

19:41.055 --> 19:42.045
Wait, don't, it's money.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.759
The only thing dirtier
is airplane ice.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.514
Max, where did you
get all that?

19:45.810 --> 19:47.721
Well, I had a job, I lost it,
was backed into a corner.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.307
Sold my Beanie Baby collection,
bought a 1984 limousine.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.017
Picked up Dr.
and Mrs. Rosenberg,

19:52.316 --> 19:54.023
drove them to shul in time
for Havdalah.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.900
And by the way,
Jews are excellent tippers,

19:56.195 --> 19:57.526
so I don't know
where that came from.

19:57.822 --> 19:59.984
That's it, matzo-ball subs
back on the menu.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.023
You sold your
Beanie Baby collection?

20:02.326 --> 20:03.987
It was a tough day.
Oh, God.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.367
You had a tough day?

20:05.663 --> 20:07.119
| gotta unload 20 boxes
of baby T-shirts.

20:07.415 --> 20:10.328
Huh? Baby T-shirts?
Can I pull those off?

20:10.626 --> 20:11.832
[-- I can't.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.835
You do have a store credit.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.919
Don't tell me that.
Ah! I can't. I shan't. Ugh!

20:18.217 --> 20:19.207
Come on.
| want to.

20:19.510 --> 20:20.716
You could. You could.
Don't do it.

20:21.011 --> 20:22.297
Don't do it. Don't do it.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.178
Don't. I won't.
| won't. I'm a man.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.931
Should I hold any onesies?
