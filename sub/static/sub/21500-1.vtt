00:35.035 --> 00:35.969
Amelia, thank you for agreeing

00:35.970 --> 00:37.270
to do this interview.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.771
Thank you for coming.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.273
Thank you.

00:40.274 --> 00:43.343
I'm a little nervous.

00:43.344 --> 00:45.678
Really? How so?

00:45.679 --> 00:48.181
Cameras, people watching,

00:48.182 --> 00:51.784
kind of feeling the
pressure, you know?

00:51.785 --> 00:54.254
What I actually
mean is some people

00:54.255 --> 00:56.623
may be asking how
it's possible for you

00:56.624 --> 01:00.761
to even feel nervousness
considering what you are.

01:01.929 --> 01:03.396
How did you feel
when you realized

01:03.397 --> 01:05.899
that you were no longer human?

01:18.212 --> 01:19.446
What we're working on

01:19.447 --> 01:21.981
is going to change the world.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.650
Scientists have known for years

01:23.651 --> 01:26.453
that the human brain is
essentially an electrical device.

01:26.454 --> 01:29.456
Beginning data stream in 10...

01:32.426 --> 01:34.060
Seven, six.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.396
That's where our memories
are, everything about us.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.466
Our hopes, fears, dreams.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.639
Six, five, four.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.176
Transmitting neural
impulses from the brain

01:49.177 --> 01:50.310
is nothing new.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.245
This, this is the next step.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.347
Containing those connections.

01:54.348 --> 01:57.984
We can't return life
that's already lost.

02:00.388 --> 02:02.189
But, we might be
able to intercede

02:02.190 --> 02:04.257
before the moment of death

02:04.258 --> 02:06.125
and rescue a person's
consciousness

02:06.126 --> 02:08.461
before it's lost forever.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.101
If we can do that,
then that is the key

02:15.102 --> 02:18.672
to living forever, to
saving those we love.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.648
To saving those who
leave us too soon.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.985
That's what we're trying to do.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.288
Every day we learn new ways

02:35.289 --> 02:37.657
to conquer the limits
of the human body.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.961
We're approaching new
worlds, new frontiers,

02:41.962 --> 02:43.730
and new possibilities for life.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.833
And I will tell you, we
are already looking forward

02:46.834 --> 02:49.001
to the students,
to the pioneers,

02:49.002 --> 02:50.470
and the breakthroughs
yet to come.

02:50.471 --> 02:53.406
Each day we hear new
ideas, see new projects,

02:53.407 --> 02:55.107
and we meet new heroes.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.244
Here's to building
a better future.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.279
Here's to building
better people.

03:24.272 --> 03:28.442
Dad used to say that life
was like a light switch.

03:30.478 --> 03:33.381
You die and you're
just turned off.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.787
I don't think he
was ever afraid.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.859
What do you think?

03:52.666 --> 03:55.403
Still not used to it, you know?

04:06.780 --> 04:07.780
Just...

04:08.949 --> 04:11.519
Tell me what you need me to do.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.059
Stay safe out there.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.894
Here's the thing, Adah,

04:21.894 --> 04:24.431
there's no such thing as
the natural order of life.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.733
You're saying in your
book that transhumanism

04:26.734 --> 04:30.036
is humanity escaping the
bounds of the human body,

04:30.037 --> 04:32.372
but again, keep in mind
we're talking to everyone

04:32.373 --> 04:35.408
that has the main
idea that humanity

04:35.409 --> 04:39.579
is having flesh and
bones, being human itself

04:39.580 --> 04:40.980
and having a physical body.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.081
Everything that we engineer,

04:42.082 --> 04:43.583
everything that we do...

04:43.584 --> 04:45.919
For lunch there is celery.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.355
You need to tell
that partner of yours

04:48.356 --> 04:50.457
that he's a bad
influence on you.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.759
Gotta keep you
lookin' good, mister.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.026
Mm-hm.

04:54.027 --> 04:57.498
Maybe I can just call
in sick to work and...

05:00.334 --> 05:02.168
You know, one of these
days I got to tell Amelia

05:02.169 --> 05:04.637
I need more calories
than a ham sandwich.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.138
Enjoy it while it lasts.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.576
Still have things about
each other you don't know.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.110
That's not true, Vaughan.

05:11.111 --> 05:13.613
Carter, I've been
married since college.

05:13.614 --> 05:15.247
You got five months tops, right,

05:15.248 --> 05:17.550
and then she accidentally
leaves the bathroom door open

05:17.551 --> 05:20.019
or forgets to flush.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.589
Next thing you know,
seven years go by

05:22.590 --> 05:24.323
and you got a mortgage.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.558
She starts talkin' about kids.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.794
You guys have talked
about that, right?

05:27.795 --> 05:28.795
Yeah.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.333
I mean, not recently.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.373
What the hell's so funny.

05:40.374 --> 05:41.841
Oh, it's comin'.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.211
Oh, welcome to the club
of former honeymooners.

05:45.212 --> 05:47.980
You better start
picking out baby names.

05:47.981 --> 05:48.982
Until then,

05:51.051 --> 05:52.386
enjoy this time.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.621
I am.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.556
And you know what, I'm
actually looking forward

05:55.557 --> 05:56.889
to picking out baby names.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.191
I am.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.593
All units be advised,

06:00.594 --> 06:02.028
reports of a mentally unstable
man on Lily Boulevard.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.696
Can I get a responder?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.264
So much for lunch.

06:19.179 --> 06:21.849
Are you okay, Mrs. Summerland?

06:26.119 --> 06:27.520
Did you forget something?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.888
Yeah, my tablet.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.824
Yeah, right.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.839
Sir?

06:55.215 --> 06:56.783
Sir, I need
you to take your hands

06:56.784 --> 06:58.452
out of your pockets.

07:00.287 --> 07:04.224
It's a beautiful
day, don't ya think?

07:09.463 --> 07:11.532
Look, take it easy, okay?

07:34.922 --> 07:37.356
Why didn't you shoot me?

07:37.357 --> 07:38.291
It's all right.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.360
It's all right, it's over.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.895
You all right?

07:42.896 --> 07:43.963
I'm gonna need you
to put your hands

07:43.964 --> 07:46.299
behind your back, all right?

08:00.413 --> 08:01.413
Amelia!

08:32.645 --> 08:34.714
Carter.

08:51.331 --> 08:53.032
So, Andrew's leaning
up against the bar,

08:53.033 --> 08:55.534
now bear in mind he's really
drunk right now, right?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.670
And this woman, she
saddles up next to him

08:57.671 --> 09:00.072
and she says, "When
a woman asks you"

09:00.073 --> 09:02.909
"how old you think she
is, take your best guess"

09:02.910 --> 09:05.411
"and subtract by 10."

09:05.412 --> 09:08.615
And Andrew here
just goes, "I did."

09:13.420 --> 09:17.389
Hey, Carter, we're heading
to the Starlight tonight

09:17.390 --> 09:19.225
if you wanna come.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.661
Yeah, I'll see.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.698
Tell her hey for me, all right?

09:51.358 --> 09:52.693
Hey beautiful.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.168
Brought you flowers.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.152
I missed you.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.491
Got big news today.

10:25.492 --> 10:28.160
It has been exactly
six months this week

10:28.161 --> 10:30.730
since I stopped energy drinks

10:30.731 --> 10:34.033
and I've been taking
lunch to work.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.034
Mostly.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.124
I thought it was good!

11:32.125 --> 11:33.325
- Really?
- I liked it.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.660
You couldn't have,
you fell asleep.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.661
It was, I...

11:36.764 --> 11:37.797
But before that,
before I fell asleep,

11:37.798 --> 11:38.965
I thought it was fun.

11:38.966 --> 11:41.400
For three minutes?

11:41.401 --> 11:42.903
Uh-huh.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.006
So, what else do you wanna do?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.674
When you're not
ticketing adorable women

11:48.675 --> 11:50.609
for going five over.

11:50.610 --> 11:52.244
Adorable, huh?

11:52.245 --> 11:53.545
And smart.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.181
Okay.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.182
And funny.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.017
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

11:57.018 --> 11:58.117
Uh-huh.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.186
What do you do?

12:00.187 --> 12:01.388
I don't know.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.657
Really? Come on.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.795
There's got to be somethin'.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.302
Maybe a little
street piano playing?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.738
No, I could

12:19.739 --> 12:23.109
never really push a
piano down the street.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.210
Ha!

12:24.211 --> 12:25.845
They are heavy.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.546
Just sayin'.

12:27.547 --> 12:29.615
All right, okay.

12:29.616 --> 12:33.787
So you're not very strong,
I got that.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.925
How about something you can
do or that you like to do.

12:38.926 --> 12:39.926
Anything.

12:40.928 --> 12:41.928
Something.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.198
How 'bout I show you?

12:46.199 --> 12:47.199
Okay.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.071
What's that?

13:29.209 --> 13:30.209
Jesus.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.782
Thanks for answering your phone.

13:36.783 --> 13:40.252
I thought you had plans
tonight with the guys.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.253
Yeah.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.624
How are you?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.893
I'm great.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.294
I paid off another installment.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.528
I applied for the Wesley grant.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.263
I'm using my site
to raise donations.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.764
Oh.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.701
Thought you said you were two
months behind on your house.

13:55.702 --> 13:56.702
Yeah.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.974
Amelia's got maybe a
few more months, maybe.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.911
But there's still time.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.748
Look, Carter.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.021
I know it's tough
to let go, I get it.

14:17.925 --> 14:21.627
If there's anything
you need, let me know.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.196
I need more time.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.901
Every day we learn new
ways to conquer the limits

14:28.902 --> 14:30.970
of the human body.

14:30.971 --> 14:34.573
We're approaching new
worlds, new frontiers,

14:34.574 --> 14:37.343
and new possibilities for life.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.979
So, while I thank you for
this award I will tell you,

14:39.980 --> 14:42.014
we are already looking forward

14:42.015 --> 14:44.016
to the students,
to the pioneers,

14:44.017 --> 14:45.351
to the breakthroughs
yet to come.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.187
Each day we hear new
ideas, see new projects,

14:48.188 --> 14:49.888
and we meet new heroes.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.890
Here's to building
a better future.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.193
Here's to building
better people.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.268
Of course I can't believe it.

15:02.269 --> 15:03.269
Paul Wesley.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.037
Well, congrats.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.272
Well, thank you.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.473
So, Paul Wesley, when
are you gonna start

15:07.474 --> 15:08.941
returning my phone calls?

15:08.942 --> 15:11.343
When your show stops pandering
to corn fed housewives.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.946
Tell you producers to reach
outside the box they're in.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.214
- Ooh, ouch.
- Ow.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.282
I was referring to
dinner, but I think

15:16.283 --> 15:17.849
I'll rescind the offer.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.351
Good to see ya, Adah.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.187
Take this.

15:20.188 --> 15:21.420
Yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.754
I'm on a flight in
30 minutes, Ellen.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.990
What have you got?

15:23.991 --> 15:27.159
I think we have a candidate.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.660
The leukemia patient?

15:28.661 --> 15:30.629
No, he's made a full recovery.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.331
That's unfortunate.

15:32.332 --> 15:36.202
Amelia Summerland,
age 26, coma patient.

15:36.203 --> 15:37.436
Aneurysm two years ago.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.271
Diagnosis of Locked-in syndrome.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.807
The brain is fully intact
but much left on her body.

15:41.808 --> 15:42.975
She's married?

15:42.976 --> 15:44.410
Yes, Carter Summerland.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.345
I'm sorry, do I know you?

15:45.346 --> 15:46.612
I'm Paul Wesley.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.347
I believe you applied
for one of my grants.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.916
We need to speak to you
immediately about Amelia.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.818
Any other family
members our lawyers

15:52.819 --> 15:53.919
have to worry about?

15:53.920 --> 15:54.854
She's an only child.

15:54.854 --> 15:55.788
Her parents are deceased.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.156
Mr. Summerland, do you know

15:57.157 --> 15:59.291
what a non-disclosure
agreement is?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.093
Yeah.

16:00.094 --> 16:01.127
Good.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.128
Sign that.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.116
Max, just in time.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.784
Mr. Summerland,
nice to meet you.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.419
Max Parker, lead robotics.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.020
We're excited to
show you the lab.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.522
Right this way.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.525
Now entering
cyber level four, section D.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.994
All right, all non-essential
personnel, clear out.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.632
Carter, I want you to
meet Dr. Ellen Beckett.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.334
Very nice to meet
you, Mr. Summerland.

17:15.335 --> 17:16.602
Dr. Beckett is the
chief neurologist

17:16.603 --> 17:18.304
for Wesley Enterprises.

17:18.305 --> 17:20.205
She's been studying
Amelia's scans.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.040
Most coma patients have seen

17:22.040 --> 17:24.710
significant deterioration
by this point.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.578
I think there's a
wonderful chance

17:26.579 --> 17:29.248
that your wife is
still in there.

17:29.249 --> 17:30.416
Dr. Beckett is the main reason

17:30.417 --> 17:31.483
we've made such progress
in brain injuries

17:31.484 --> 17:33.152
over the past 10 years.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.753
You can fix Amelia?

17:34.754 --> 17:36.222
Better.

17:36.223 --> 17:39.959
Mr. Summerland, I'd
like you to meet Cindy 69.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.329
Go ahead, touch her.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.830
This is the latest generation

17:44.831 --> 17:47.833
of the Cindy 69 companion robot.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.235
My design.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.669
Max, couldn't you
have brought down

17:50.670 --> 17:52.171
one of the elderly
assistance models?

17:52.172 --> 17:54.306
But Mr. Wesley,
this model has the latest

17:54.307 --> 17:56.242
biosynthetic flesh, state of...

17:56.243 --> 17:58.043
Online.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.345
That feels real nice.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.579
Sorry.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.281
That feels real nice.

18:01.282 --> 18:02.548
Okay, sorry.

18:02.549 --> 18:03.815
- That feels real...
- Sorry about that.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.886
I didn't think she
was activated yet.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.521
I don't understand.

18:09.522 --> 18:10.789
I apologize, Carter.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.691
Max's social skills
aside, you can tell

18:12.692 --> 18:16.462
that this technology is
indistinguishable from human flesh.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.665
Mr. Summerland,
we can help Amelia

18:19.666 --> 18:23.535
by putting her brain
into a new body.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.770
Into that?

18:24.771 --> 18:28.974
We can build an exact
replica of your wife.

18:33.146 --> 18:36.248
Wait, Mr. Summerland,
we can help you.

18:36.249 --> 18:37.483
You wanna help me?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.050
Put Amelia in a better facility.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.187
Find me someone who
understands Locked-in Syndrome.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.088
But that?

18:42.089 --> 18:43.389
It's not even human.

18:43.390 --> 18:47.058
We have artificial
hearts, artificial hips.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.760
We've been replacing
worn out parts

18:48.761 --> 18:51.363
on ourselves for the
better part of a century.

18:51.364 --> 18:52.931
You can't tell me
that's the same thing.

18:52.932 --> 18:56.335
Mr. Summerland, can
I put it another way?

18:56.336 --> 18:57.336
Kim.

18:58.605 --> 19:03.375
Okay, say I wanted to replace
the front end of this pen.

19:03.376 --> 19:06.546
I take it off, put
a new front end on.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.048
Ta-da, there's my pen.

19:10.049 --> 19:12.751
But wait, what if I want to
replace the other half of it?

19:12.752 --> 19:13.686
No problem.

19:13.687 --> 19:15.987
I just unscrew that, right?

19:15.988 --> 19:18.490
Screw a new backend on.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.058
There's my pen.

19:20.059 --> 19:24.162
Uh-oh, but look, here are the
two pieces that I replaced.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.066
If I were to put
these back together...

19:28.067 --> 19:30.436
Would that be the original pen?

19:30.437 --> 19:33.572
Or is that the original pen now?

19:33.573 --> 19:34.906
Hm?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.075
Do you get it?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.750
You've agreed to
complete secrecy.

19:44.751 --> 19:48.720
You discuss this with anyone,
the offer's off the table.

20:03.570 --> 20:05.871
I once had a daughter.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.740
In five seconds I went
from driving her to school

20:08.741 --> 20:11.077
to a bed just like this one.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.383
We chose Amelia
because she's young.

20:17.384 --> 20:20.752
Her mind is healthy and
we know when and how

20:20.753 --> 20:22.588
she's going to die.

20:22.589 --> 20:26.625
We're offering you
the chance to see her,

20:26.626 --> 20:28.127
to hold her again.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.502
If I say yes, what happens?

20:36.503 --> 20:38.169
You would sign power of attorney

20:38.170 --> 20:39.538
over to Wesley Enterprises.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.740
You would give consent
on your wife's behalf

20:41.741 --> 20:43.275
to this procedure.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.877
When your wife passes
away, they take her body.

20:45.878 --> 20:48.480
She gets officially donated
to scientific research,

20:48.481 --> 20:49.981
but we stay discreet.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.351
We then preserve her
brain and begin a process

20:52.352 --> 20:53.652
we call mapping.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.886
How long does that take?

20:54.887 --> 20:56.322
We need to acclimate
her to a new body

20:56.323 --> 20:58.590
and she'll require
therapy, physical, mental.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.560
It's gonna be some time.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.535
We ask that you
comfort us in this time

22:16.536 --> 22:18.003
and for the future.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.105
It is with our faith in you
that we commit her body,

22:20.106 --> 22:23.275
her heart, her being,
into your hands.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.114
Insiders suggest
something big on the horizon

22:29.115 --> 22:31.817
for the multi-billion
dollar research facility.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.885
Many may remember
Wesley Enterprises

22:33.886 --> 22:36.087
was in a similar situation
just a few years ago.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.023
What else do you wanna do?

22:38.024 --> 22:39.991
When you're not
ticketing adorable women

22:39.992 --> 22:41.693
for going five over.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.663
This isn't just Wesley
Enterprises playing it safe.

22:44.664 --> 22:45.864
We've seen literally everything

22:45.865 --> 22:46.965
from this company.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.199
Solar powered blankets,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.135
mission heat tiles,
robot sex toys.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.403
I think it's safe...

22:51.404 --> 22:53.572
To expect the unexpected.

22:53.573 --> 22:56.675
Is Paul Wesley sparking
another scientific revolution?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.410
We'll just have to wait and see.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.516
And we say they fear

23:03.517 --> 23:05.350
what they do not understand.

23:05.351 --> 23:08.554
Talk about some of the good
that Wesley Enterprises...

23:25.905 --> 23:27.205
It is with our faith in you

23:27.206 --> 23:30.976
that we commit her
body, heart, her being,

23:30.977 --> 23:32.678
into your hands.

23:32.679 --> 23:34.013
Into your hands.

23:35.247 --> 23:36.649
Hello.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.527
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:48.528 --> 23:49.462
Step away from each other.

23:49.462 --> 23:50.196
Hey, that's enough.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.030
Back off.

23:51.031 --> 23:52.263
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:52.264 --> 23:52.932
You back up and stay there.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.032
Don't move.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.101
- You back off, asshole.
- Do not move.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.769
Oh my God!

23:57.770 --> 24:01.873
Hey, what the fuck
is the matter with you?

24:03.510 --> 24:04.510
Hey!

24:05.311 --> 24:06.546
Get in the car.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.449
I wrote a poem.

24:27.066 --> 24:28.567
What about the soul?

24:28.568 --> 24:32.003
What about the fact that we
are created in God's own image?

24:32.004 --> 24:34.272
Quite frankly, I'm shocked
that a Nobel Prize winner

24:34.273 --> 24:36.107
like Dr. Beckett
would engage in work

24:36.108 --> 24:38.309
that seems to suggest that
being human is nothing special.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.578
Which on the face of it...

24:39.579 --> 24:41.580
Actually, Senator,
I think human beings

24:41.581 --> 24:45.250
are extremely special
and worth saving.

24:45.251 --> 24:48.286
Senator, if someone has
early stage Alzheimer's,

24:48.287 --> 24:50.255
then if the technology
that she advocates

24:50.256 --> 24:52.958
becomes reality, it
could save them, correct?

24:52.959 --> 24:56.227
I believe there's a reason
why we don't live forever.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.462
We're not meant to.

24:57.463 --> 24:59.030
Human beings weren't
meant to fly either.

24:59.031 --> 25:00.699
We weren't meant
to travel in space.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.734
We weren't meant to
talk to each other

25:02.735 --> 25:04.135
from across the world.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.370
- Doctor...
- Dialysis,

25:05.371 --> 25:08.206
heart transplants,
bypass surgery.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.543
You're familiar with that
one, aren't ya, Senator?

25:11.544 --> 25:13.745
Well, since I see you
wish to make this personal,

25:13.746 --> 25:15.146
I'd just throw that
question right back at you.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.582
That's a good
point, Dr. Beckett.

25:16.583 --> 25:19.250
Many are familiar with the
tragedy that took your daughter.

25:19.251 --> 25:21.186
Are you saying in
theory you'd really

25:21.187 --> 25:23.454
be willing to
replace her this way?

25:23.455 --> 25:25.090
Don't you think as
her mother that might

25:25.091 --> 25:26.592
cheapen her memory?

25:26.593 --> 25:29.661
If you see what we're doing
as Frankensteining someone.

25:29.662 --> 25:31.096
Which is absolutely

25:31.097 --> 25:32.130
- not the case.
- That is exactly

25:32.131 --> 25:33.364
what you're doing.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.200
We are talking
about transplants.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.869
The idea behind the technology
that God has given us?

25:37.870 --> 25:39.170
That's not the problem.

25:39.171 --> 25:42.073
But with what some
people might do with it.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.274
This theory

25:43.275 --> 25:44.076
- that Dr. Beckett...
- This is not

25:44.077 --> 25:45.443
a theory, Senator.

25:45.444 --> 25:47.378
This will happen.

25:47.379 --> 25:51.116
You will see us save someone's
life with this technology.

25:51.117 --> 25:54.152
And you will know that we did it

25:54.153 --> 25:55.588
and not your God.

25:57.456 --> 25:59.224
That did not help us.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.926
These people don't
care about science, Paul.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.427
We're trying to lay
the groundwork here

26:02.428 --> 26:03.629
to gain some credibility.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.230
You can't go off book like that.

26:05.231 --> 26:08.133
Since when did credibility
involve arguing with the right?

26:08.134 --> 26:10.101
That's the conversation
you shouldn't be having.

26:10.102 --> 26:13.104
It validates their opinions.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.405
Dr. Beckett, you need

26:14.406 --> 26:15.641
to come downstairs immediately.

26:15.642 --> 26:16.642
Why?

26:17.944 --> 26:20.946
Her patterns spike when
we speak directly to her.

26:20.947 --> 26:21.947
Watch.

26:23.215 --> 26:27.219
She knows that I'm speaking
specifically to her.

26:29.689 --> 26:33.825
Amelia.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.126
Ellen.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.695
Paul.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.696
Max.

26:38.798 --> 26:42.234
Amelia.

26:45.304 --> 26:47.505
Okay, let me try something.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.207
Hundreds of years of
research and discovery

26:49.208 --> 26:51.542
and the fix might be as
simple as a light bulb.

26:51.543 --> 26:53.078
What are you talking about?

26:53.079 --> 26:54.112
Voltage.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.781
Activity increase.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.849
Consciousness to level six.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.931
Beginning voltage
increase in 10,

27:12.932 --> 27:14.165
nine,

27:14.166 --> 27:15.233
eight,

27:15.234 --> 27:16.467
seven,

27:16.468 --> 27:17.635
six,

27:17.636 --> 27:18.670
five,

27:18.671 --> 27:19.671
four,

27:19.672 --> 27:20.872
three,

27:20.873 --> 27:22.007
two,

27:22.008 --> 27:23.008
one.

27:24.276 --> 27:25.778
Subject is online.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.658
Amelia,

27:42.962 --> 27:44.296
can you hear me?

27:50.870 --> 27:53.039
Do you know where you are?

28:00.579 --> 28:02.548
Do you know who you are?

28:11.457 --> 28:14.025
Can you tell me your name?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.305
I'm Amelia Summerland.

28:37.850 --> 28:41.087
I know, I know, I know, I know.

28:41.988 --> 28:42.889
Wait, wait.

28:42.890 --> 28:44.823
Quiet, quiet everybody.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.091
Oh shit.

28:46.092 --> 28:46.926
Heart stop.

28:46.927 --> 28:48.093
Heart stop!

28:48.094 --> 28:49.427
- Stop it.
- Get a hold of her.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.565
You're safe.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.665
You're safe, Amelia.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.034
You're safe.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.368
You're safe.

29:04.743 --> 29:08.013
We've lost everything.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.381
We need to tell her.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.649
She won't be able to handle it.

29:11.650 --> 29:12.750
It couldn't possibly be worse

29:12.751 --> 29:15.353
than the episode we just had.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.655
Blunt her emotions.

29:17.656 --> 29:19.325
It'll keep her calm.

29:30.369 --> 29:33.471
So, um, what that means, Amelia,

29:33.472 --> 29:36.341
is that you will never age.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.243
You'll never get sick.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.278
You'll never die.

29:40.279 --> 29:42.949
You're still you, Amelia, but...

29:44.250 --> 29:46.517
You're different now.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.755
Tell me what you're
thinking, Amelia.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.160
Who are all of you?

29:59.165 --> 30:01.867
Wesley Enterprises
experienced a record low

30:01.868 --> 30:03.801
last quarter but
remain optimistic.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.203
Insiders suggest something big...

30:05.204 --> 30:06.304
I want to announce it.

30:06.305 --> 30:07.505
She's not ready.

30:07.506 --> 30:08.773
She's talking,
for the love of God.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.608
She struggles
with motor control.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.177
She can't walk
without assistance.

30:12.178 --> 30:13.979
Her nervous system
is a disaster.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.746
The interface, it overclocks.

30:15.747 --> 30:16.948
The computer can't keep up.

30:16.949 --> 30:19.217
She's had several
catastrophic failures.

30:19.218 --> 30:23.389
When the computer resets,
we have to completely rebuild.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.626
We're six days from an
update with the board.

30:28.627 --> 30:30.328
We have to make something up.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.063
How long does it
take to rebuild?

30:32.064 --> 30:33.431
Weeks.

30:33.432 --> 30:34.400
I mean, it's not a simple.
23 hours to be

30:34.401 --> 30:35.634
- precise.
- Process.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.802
Here's what we're gonna do.

30:37.803 --> 30:38.770
We're gonna put
her back on line.

30:38.771 --> 30:40.005
I'm letting Carter meet her.

30:40.006 --> 30:41.472
It's too soon.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.975
We have to have something
to show these people.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.410
Imagine how they're gonna react

30:45.411 --> 30:46.978
when they see Carter
reunited with his dead wife.

30:46.979 --> 30:48.980
The emotional stimuli
might cause another failure.

30:48.981 --> 30:49.916
We have to do something.

30:49.917 --> 30:51.116
What about Carter?

30:51.117 --> 30:52.583
I'm worried what
that might do to him.

30:52.584 --> 30:56.588
I'm worried about keeping
this project funded.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.146
Carter.

31:21.180 --> 31:22.180
Amelia.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.620
You have a visitor.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.819
Hello.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.889
We'll be right outside.

32:42.494 --> 32:46.031
Do you know what
they did with my ring?

32:46.032 --> 32:47.033
Your ring?

32:48.167 --> 32:51.070
It's been missing
since I woke up.

33:07.019 --> 33:10.421
They wouldn't let me see you.

33:10.422 --> 33:11.422
Why not?

33:16.928 --> 33:19.130
They said there's
things they don't want us

33:19.131 --> 33:20.632
to talk about yet.

33:23.302 --> 33:28.173
They said it's the only
way that you'll get better.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.175
Am I sick?

33:33.679 --> 33:35.513
Not anymore.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.417
Then why do I
need to get better?

33:39.285 --> 33:40.918
Millie.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.490
There's something in my ear.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.425
I can feel it there.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.893
I'll talk to the doctors.

33:48.894 --> 33:49.894
My ring.

33:50.762 --> 33:53.365
Can I have it back now, please?

33:55.501 --> 33:56.502
Of course.

34:17.255 --> 34:19.425
I never stopped believing.

34:21.827 --> 34:23.562
I don't understand.

34:24.630 --> 34:25.630
Who are you?

34:27.799 --> 34:28.734
I can feel my hand stall now.

34:28.734 --> 34:29.734
Really?

34:33.405 --> 34:34.405
What?

34:35.440 --> 34:36.907
Somebody get in here!

34:36.908 --> 34:37.708
Get back.

34:37.710 --> 34:38.976
Move!

34:38.976 --> 34:39.976
Tell me what's happening.

34:40.713 --> 34:42.179
Get her legs.

34:42.181 --> 34:43.514
Don't worry, Carter,
this has happened before.

34:43.514 --> 34:44.815
Get her to the chair.

34:44.815 --> 34:46.083
One, two, up.

34:46.083 --> 34:47.717
Tell me what's happening!

34:47.719 --> 34:50.420
Mr. Summerland,
you need to leave.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.223
Mr. Summerland, you
need to leave now.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.559
What are you doing to my wife?

34:57.429 --> 34:59.029
What are you doing to my wife?

34:59.030 --> 35:00.298
Get control of her, Max.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.733
I'm workin' on it!

35:53.419 --> 35:54.619
Don't look.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.254
We noticed when Ellen
would play Mozart

35:56.255 --> 35:59.390
over the intercom your
brain activity would spike.

35:59.391 --> 36:03.594
So, we figured this
might help you redevelop

36:03.595 --> 36:06.030
some of those
broken connections.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.033
And this little present.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.771
This is a textbook example
of art meeting science.

36:13.772 --> 36:16.574
When Dr. Beckett
developed microbes

36:16.575 --> 36:20.445
that specifically target
cells to help them grow,

36:20.446 --> 36:23.080
this was the first
clinical subject.

36:23.081 --> 36:26.418
This plant hasn't
aged in over a decade.

36:29.821 --> 36:30.822
So it's...

36:32.358 --> 36:33.758
Real?

36:33.759 --> 36:35.460
Absolutely.

36:35.461 --> 36:38.297
But just, you know,
not all of it.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.733
I guess it's like you.

36:43.034 --> 36:44.034
Like me.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.572
You are Amelia.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.112
I don't remember if I played.

36:55.113 --> 36:56.213
Oh, don't worry.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.315
It's easy, here.

36:57.316 --> 36:58.349
We're just gonna do the basics.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.550
I'll show you.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.551
Come look.

37:01.687 --> 37:02.687
This is C.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.725
Go ahead, play it.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.129
What are you feeling?

37:12.130 --> 37:13.130
Nothing.

37:15.967 --> 37:16.967
Okay.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.337
I'm gonna try
something different.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.238
You're gonna feel something
completely different,

37:21.239 --> 37:25.076
but it's a good feeling,
so don't worry, okay?

37:28.079 --> 37:30.515
Emotions
processing unit reacting.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.851
Okay, play it again.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.596
That...

37:47.533 --> 37:48.700
is beautiful.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.871
Okay, play it again.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.006
But take it easy, okay?

37:56.007 --> 37:58.577
Your mind's trying to catch up.

38:09.755 --> 38:10.822
That's music.

38:27.072 --> 38:30.240
It wasn't my decision to
introduce her to you yet.

38:30.241 --> 38:32.309
She wasn't ready.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.146
We found the problem
and fixed it.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.488
Why isn't she moving?

38:43.489 --> 38:45.956
She's in standby mode.

38:45.957 --> 38:47.958
Unaware of anything around
her until we give her

38:47.959 --> 38:51.028
the verbal command
to wake up again.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.598
It's like sleeping.

38:53.599 --> 38:54.865
- No.
- Carter.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.300
You have her on
a remote control?

38:56.301 --> 38:57.535
It's not like that.

38:57.536 --> 38:58.370
This isn't right.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.304
She was at peace.

38:59.305 --> 39:00.671
Carter, please, please.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.507
I understand.

39:01.508 --> 39:02.873
I really do.

39:02.874 --> 39:06.478
It looks very strange
seeing her like this.

39:10.048 --> 39:13.150
Where is your
daughter now, Ellen?

39:13.151 --> 39:15.520
I beg your pardon?

39:15.521 --> 39:17.488
Where is her body?

39:17.489 --> 39:18.723
Carter.

39:18.724 --> 39:20.090
Where is she.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.427
In the ground.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.864
Where is Amelia?

39:34.473 --> 39:37.408
Find a different test subject.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.745
You know we can't do that.

39:47.285 --> 39:49.186
Wesley Enterprises,
the tech giant

39:49.187 --> 39:50.788
positioned in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa...

39:50.789 --> 39:52.857
Shocked the world today
when founder Paul Wesley

39:52.858 --> 39:55.493
announced what he says is
the first successful copy

39:55.494 --> 39:56.994
of a human brain.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.430
This will give new hope
to Alzheimer's patients,

39:59.431 --> 40:02.366
to parapalegics, to those
suffering from terminal illness.

40:02.367 --> 40:03.268
Our Amelia

40:03.269 --> 40:04.502
is the future.

40:04.503 --> 40:06.671
Wesley released
no images of Amelia,

40:06.672 --> 40:09.173
but promised to unveil her
publicly three months from now.

40:09.174 --> 40:10.675
Wesley's announcement
sent shock waves

40:10.676 --> 40:13.143
through both the medical
and religious communities.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.645
Protestors rallied
outside the capital

40:14.646 --> 40:16.280
calling for strict legislation...

40:16.281 --> 40:19.550
That clearly defined the
definition of human and machine.

40:19.551 --> 40:22.286
Proponents of the new technology
suggest current definitions

40:22.287 --> 40:25.422
are vague and open
to interpretation.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.625
My colleagues, it would
be foolish to suggest

40:27.626 --> 40:31.095
that the world would be
better off without technology.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.899
Without our advanced care
for the sick and elderly.

40:34.900 --> 40:38.402
But these technologies
work in harmony

40:38.403 --> 40:41.706
with the human spirit,
not against it.

40:41.707 --> 40:43.974
These are gifts from God

40:43.975 --> 40:47.912
and if we attempt to
escape from these gifts,

40:47.913 --> 40:51.482
to reach higher than we
were intended to reach,

40:51.483 --> 40:55.086
we will have become
arrogant and foolhardy.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.924
Hi, Carter, this
is Senator Williams office.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.191
We received your message.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.460
We'd like to speak with
you as soon as possible.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.019
More of her memories are turning

41:29.020 --> 41:31.656
but four weeks to
play Twinkle Twinkle?

41:31.657 --> 41:32.890
I am sorry, Max.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.491
Oh no, no, no,
it's not your fault.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.226
Don't apologize.

41:36.227 --> 41:39.296
The important thing is that
you're making progress.

41:39.297 --> 41:40.330
And that is good?

41:40.331 --> 41:43.033
It's very good, Amelia,

41:43.034 --> 41:45.836
considering most of what you
remember was left in fragments.

41:45.837 --> 41:50.741
We have the data here showing
you're making huge strides.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.977
Yesterday you told us a story,

41:52.978 --> 41:54.879
the one in the park.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.214
Do you remember?

41:57.515 --> 41:58.515
Yes.

42:07.458 --> 42:08.826
I'm by a lake.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.294
I jump in.

42:10.295 --> 42:14.065
This other man does, too, but
I can't remember his face.

42:18.904 --> 42:21.907
Some kids nearby
are laughing at us.

42:27.312 --> 42:29.147
My face is underwater.

42:34.653 --> 42:36.154
I can feel summer.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.590
Now we're sitting under a tree.

42:39.591 --> 42:40.891
I'm reading a poem to the man,

42:40.892 --> 42:43.161
something I wrote, I think.

42:50.135 --> 42:52.870
I can't remember his face.

42:52.871 --> 42:54.905
We're walking through a garden.

42:54.906 --> 42:57.174
There's a dance by.

42:57.175 --> 42:59.110
I don't understand why.

43:00.679 --> 43:03.648
There's a feeling of happiness.

43:07.052 --> 43:08.987
A girl walks in, she...

43:11.256 --> 43:13.123
I want you to keep
thinking about that, Amelia,

43:13.124 --> 43:14.892
that exact moment.

43:14.893 --> 43:18.428
Everything is blurring
together, Dr. Beckett.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.496
Where is the ring?

43:21.332 --> 43:23.067
The screeching...

43:23.068 --> 43:24.068
sound.

43:32.678 --> 43:36.814
Warning.

43:41.152 --> 43:42.821
All systems offline.

43:44.322 --> 43:46.657
Well, it's very strange.

43:46.658 --> 43:48.759
It's too unpredictable.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.828
There's nothing about
what she remembers

43:50.829 --> 43:52.997
that makes any sense.

43:52.998 --> 43:55.000
She needs information.

43:57.268 --> 43:58.435
She doesn't know what to do

43:58.436 --> 44:01.072
with the information
she has now.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.574
Just keep her playing scales.

44:04.575 --> 44:06.010
Understood?

44:06.011 --> 44:07.078
Understood.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.424
Build.

44:20.425 --> 44:21.658
Good morning.

44:26.131 --> 44:28.165
That's one of the few
advantages being a computer

44:28.166 --> 44:29.500
has over humans.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.569
The dreams, they're
more vivid, right?

44:34.072 --> 44:36.841
Yeah, your mind is more free
to create than an organic one.

44:36.842 --> 44:38.809
In fact, if I hadn't
fixed a small glitch,

44:38.810 --> 44:40.711
your brain wouldn't
be able to distinguish

44:40.712 --> 44:42.813
dreams from reality.

44:42.814 --> 44:44.281
Incredible, right?

44:44.282 --> 44:45.884
Look at this, look.

44:47.585 --> 44:49.053
See that?

44:49.054 --> 44:53.423
Every time I look at
these scans, I see growth.

44:53.424 --> 44:54.925
Very important.

44:54.926 --> 44:57.161
Look at all this growth,
all these new connections.

44:57.162 --> 44:59.596
It's amazing, actually.

44:59.597 --> 45:02.833
Looking at the mathematical
equivalent of your mind.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.969
You can see my thoughts?

45:04.970 --> 45:08.807
It's like looking at,
like a jpeg in binary.

45:09.841 --> 45:11.241
Yeah.

45:11.242 --> 45:15.079
Do you know, when I was
working on my thesis years ago,

45:15.080 --> 45:17.948
I spent two years
with a neurosurgeon.

45:17.949 --> 45:22.286
He likened the brain to more
of a plant than a computer.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.054
He said the task
of making a mind

45:24.055 --> 45:26.423
had nothing to do
with making it smart.

45:26.424 --> 45:28.525
You had to make something
that was capable

45:28.526 --> 45:30.260
of growing on its own.

45:30.261 --> 45:34.698
Like, even something so simple
as a tree or our flower.

45:34.699 --> 45:36.666
It's infinitely more...

45:39.771 --> 45:41.305
Hello?

45:41.306 --> 45:42.306
Hey?

45:43.408 --> 45:47.978
You're not paying attention.

45:47.979 --> 45:48.979
Sorry.

45:51.016 --> 45:52.950
Max, can you tell me something?

45:52.951 --> 45:54.052
Sure.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.957
Am I still able to be a wife?

46:03.761 --> 46:05.263
Yeah, of course.

46:06.431 --> 46:08.933
I designed your body
to be 100% functional

46:08.934 --> 46:10.634
for sexual activity.

46:10.635 --> 46:11.668
You did?

46:11.669 --> 46:14.338
Yeah.

46:14.339 --> 46:15.339
Yeah.

46:16.908 --> 46:18.142
Yes.

46:19.410 --> 46:21.278
I used to head up a
love robot project.

46:21.279 --> 46:22.479
Can you believe that?

46:22.480 --> 46:25.951
I couldn't help but
pour a few things over.

46:27.418 --> 46:30.087
There's some things you're
gonna have to do to, um...

46:30.088 --> 46:32.157
prep the system, kind of.

46:33.491 --> 46:36.594
Ah, can we talk
about something else?

46:38.029 --> 46:41.899
I guess having children
is out of the question?

46:41.900 --> 46:42.900
Yeah.

46:53.611 --> 46:56.713
How long were
you married when it happened?

46:56.714 --> 46:58.849
Three months.

46:58.850 --> 47:02.954
Hm, well, any time is too
soon, but that is unfortunate.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.323
She had an aneurysm.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.925
It broke the connection
to her spinal cord

47:07.926 --> 47:10.995
but not enough to
damage the brain.

47:10.996 --> 47:14.131
I thought they could
just repair her.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.532
That's what they promised you?

47:15.533 --> 47:18.302
Not the way I thought.

47:18.303 --> 47:19.303
Hm.

47:21.339 --> 47:22.572
Well, Sam.

47:22.573 --> 47:24.741
Well, you're right to be
angry, Mr. Summerland,

47:24.742 --> 47:26.476
but for the wrong reasons.

47:26.477 --> 47:29.279
I want you to meet my chief
policy officer and advisor.

47:29.280 --> 47:30.280
Sam.

47:32.817 --> 47:36.053
Sam Patterson is an
old friend and he and I

47:36.054 --> 47:38.956
have followed Wesley's
developments for quite some time.

47:38.957 --> 47:40.557
Hi, Carter.

47:40.558 --> 47:42.026
The senator sent
me your message.

47:42.027 --> 47:43.860
I'm sorry to hear
what's happened here.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.164
This is why we have been
on this from the start.

47:47.165 --> 47:51.068
Carter, did they ask you a
lot of questions about Amelia?

47:51.069 --> 47:52.502
Of course.

47:52.503 --> 47:54.404
Did they ask you for
photographs of you together,

47:54.405 --> 47:56.006
private journals?

47:56.007 --> 47:57.241
Photos, yes.

47:57.242 --> 47:58.442
Journals, home movies?

47:58.443 --> 48:00.377
Yeah, whatever I
could get my hands on.

48:00.378 --> 48:04.015
They said it would help
return her memories.

48:05.616 --> 48:08.118
Is this a deposition?

48:08.119 --> 48:10.921
Are you familiar
with spiritual mediums?

48:10.922 --> 48:12.089
Excuse me?

48:12.090 --> 48:13.557
They use techniques
to fool people.

48:13.558 --> 48:16.760
They say general things
like, "I see a person dying"

48:16.761 --> 48:19.096
"from the chest," ooh.

48:19.097 --> 48:23.367
Well, most deaths do occur,
statistically, from the heart,

48:23.368 --> 48:25.102
so it's not a bad guess.

48:25.103 --> 48:28.138
But not to the
person who just lost

48:28.139 --> 48:29.573
a father to a heart attack.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.041
It's emotional manipulation.

48:31.042 --> 48:32.442
Carter, what they've built?

48:32.443 --> 48:34.144
It's not your wife.

48:34.145 --> 48:35.345
It's an imitation.

48:35.346 --> 48:37.248
You believe it because,

48:38.816 --> 48:41.251
well, you wanna believe it.

48:41.252 --> 48:43.887
They're counting on
people to react that way

48:43.888 --> 48:46.056
in order to sell
what they wanna sell.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.225
Immortality.

48:48.659 --> 48:50.827
People will pay
ungodly amounts of money

48:50.828 --> 48:53.230
to have a chance
to fly in space.

48:53.231 --> 48:56.633
You think they won't pay at
least a million for this?

48:56.634 --> 48:58.102
Carter, most live
their lives day to day,

48:58.103 --> 49:02.406
like you I imagine,
until something happens.

49:02.407 --> 49:04.008
You're dancing through
a big beautiful field

49:04.009 --> 49:07.077
and then suddenly a
snake jumps out and bites

49:07.078 --> 49:11.249
and the reality of our fragile
lives is suddenly exposed.

49:12.817 --> 49:15.986
We run to the one thing that
we understand to be true.

49:15.987 --> 49:17.021
Well, I don't know
what's true here,

49:17.022 --> 49:18.255
but I know what's not.

49:18.256 --> 49:22.359
For now, you can fix
this if you help us.

49:26.597 --> 49:28.765
If Congress passes
the Humanity Act

49:28.766 --> 49:31.335
it will become illegal
to copy or sell

49:31.336 --> 49:34.771
any element of the human
brain for monetary gain?

49:34.772 --> 49:36.306
Correct.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.942
I think the most obvious
critique of your viewpoint

49:38.943 --> 49:42.112
is that it forbids others
from making a choice.

49:42.113 --> 49:44.114
It's a false choice.

49:44.115 --> 49:46.383
It's something that takes
advantage of people.

49:46.384 --> 49:49.120
Mr. Summerland
can speak to that.

49:50.055 --> 49:52.623
Mr. Summerland?

50:01.732 --> 50:03.234
What she is now,

50:05.903 --> 50:07.004
it's not her.

50:10.541 --> 50:12.043
They took my wife.

50:16.013 --> 50:19.816
Carter, you said that
they took your wife.

50:19.817 --> 50:23.687
I assume you signed consent
papers, did you not?

50:23.688 --> 50:24.821
She was dying.

50:24.822 --> 50:26.223
I didn't know what to do.

50:26.224 --> 50:28.158
I think that most
people would question

50:28.159 --> 50:30.627
why you signed in
the first place.

50:30.628 --> 50:35.332
Well then, you have no
idea what it feels like.

50:35.333 --> 50:38.268
We need to change
the spin on this.

50:38.269 --> 50:40.437
I got a call from Adah Allen's
producers this morning.

50:40.438 --> 50:42.806
They want a one-on-one
interview with Amelia.

50:42.807 --> 50:44.909
No way, absolutely not.

50:46.477 --> 50:48.212
Of course you're okay with this.

50:48.213 --> 50:50.080
We need to get ahead of
William somehow, otherwise...

50:50.081 --> 50:52.516
We are not having this
conversation again, Paul.

50:52.517 --> 50:55.485
In 12 years you
have not ever once

50:55.486 --> 50:57.987
rushed one of my projects, ever.

50:57.988 --> 50:59.256
Which is why you
need to humor me.

50:59.257 --> 51:01.658
For 12 years I funded
this humanitarian work.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.460
Don't make this about
the goddamn money, Paul.

51:03.461 --> 51:05.395
I've given you a full
staff with technicians

51:05.396 --> 51:07.931
for four years, not to mention
the cost with prototypes

51:07.932 --> 51:09.533
and materials and
security and mark...

51:09.534 --> 51:11.501
The work we are doing takes time

51:11.502 --> 51:12.902
and you need to respect that.

51:12.903 --> 51:14.238
We don't have
the luxury of time.

51:14.239 --> 51:16.106
Paul we are making
progress, but you...

51:16.107 --> 51:17.108
No, Ellen!

51:19.644 --> 51:21.479
Do not destroy this.

51:30.555 --> 51:33.124
Just get Amelia ready.

51:36.194 --> 51:38.662
Got big news today.

51:38.663 --> 51:41.398
It has been exactly
six months this week

51:41.399 --> 51:43.267
since I stopped energy drinks.

51:43.268 --> 51:46.836
And I've been taking
lunch to work.

52:00.985 --> 52:01.985
I had...

52:03.888 --> 52:05.055
another dream.

52:06.324 --> 52:09.594
Okay, why don't
you tell me about it.

52:11.662 --> 52:13.331
I remember Carter.

52:15.032 --> 52:16.867
I remember everything.

52:20.671 --> 52:22.872
It's all come back.

52:22.873 --> 52:23.873
Everything.

52:24.742 --> 52:25.743
Okay, wow.

52:28.813 --> 52:29.813
Wow!

52:31.282 --> 52:32.282
Okay.

52:33.784 --> 52:36.753
I need to leave this place.

52:36.754 --> 52:39.022
I need to find my husband.

52:39.023 --> 52:40.858
Okay, shh, shh, shh.

52:44.729 --> 52:45.729
Okay.

54:03.240 --> 54:04.240
Hello?

54:08.112 --> 54:09.112
Carter?

54:14.585 --> 54:15.585
Yes?

54:17.522 --> 54:18.856
Where are you?

54:23.594 --> 54:24.828
Um...

54:24.829 --> 54:27.998
Carter, why haven't
you been to see me?

54:29.834 --> 54:31.401
I miss you.

54:31.402 --> 54:32.402
I love you.

55:10.408 --> 55:13.844
Beginning security lockdown.

55:26.691 --> 55:28.525
You are not allowed to do that.

55:28.526 --> 55:30.326
What do you mean I'm
not allowed to do that?

55:30.327 --> 55:32.929
Just like I'm not allowed
to contact Carter?

55:32.930 --> 55:34.831
God, what is wrong
with you people?

55:34.832 --> 55:37.167
You can't just keep me here.

55:42.573 --> 55:44.541
She doesn't log in
again for any reason,

55:44.542 --> 55:46.042
do you understand?

55:46.043 --> 55:48.311
I'm sorry, but how much
longer can we keep her here?

55:48.312 --> 55:49.713
You know what would
happen if she got out there.

55:49.714 --> 55:51.448
She doesn't have rights.

55:51.449 --> 55:53.684
Will you stop that, please?

56:00.357 --> 56:02.159
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

56:13.471 --> 56:15.672
I don't have rights?

56:15.673 --> 56:17.675
Amelia, you scared me.

56:23.347 --> 56:26.249
Can you appreciate the magnitude

56:26.250 --> 56:29.186
of everything that's
going on here?

56:30.421 --> 56:32.589
Now, you're saying
that electrical impulses

56:32.590 --> 56:33.657
in the brain...

56:33.658 --> 56:34.658
Oh, God.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.461
I hate television.

56:37.462 --> 56:41.297
I have to boil down
everything, all of the work,

56:41.298 --> 56:43.967
research, nuances,
discoveries, everything

56:43.968 --> 56:46.904
into something so
completely basic.

56:48.172 --> 56:49.173
It's stupid.

56:51.776 --> 56:53.277
But you know what?

56:56.514 --> 56:57.514
It worked.

56:58.749 --> 56:59.749
How?

57:01.852 --> 57:03.987
Every day we learn
new ways to conquer

57:03.988 --> 57:05.955
the limits of the human body,

57:05.956 --> 57:08.057
and yet there are still
so many barriers to cross.

57:08.058 --> 57:09.627
Goddamn it, Paul.

57:13.230 --> 57:17.767
How do you feel about going
on national television?

57:17.768 --> 57:20.771
Convincing the world
of what you are

57:21.972 --> 57:25.543
is the first step toward
your independence.

57:34.384 --> 57:35.384
Okay.

57:44.094 --> 57:48.098
We're very excited to
introduce you, you know?

57:50.635 --> 57:53.402
And, like magic, there she is.

57:53.403 --> 57:57.373
Adah Allen, I want you to
meet Amelia Summerland.

58:00.344 --> 58:01.979
Hello, Adah Allen.

58:08.719 --> 58:09.886
Paul, what is going on?

58:09.887 --> 58:11.254
You know what,
maybe we should not

58:11.255 --> 58:12.922
do this today.

58:12.923 --> 58:14.758
I'm totally messing with you.

58:14.759 --> 58:15.593
Totally messing with you.

58:15.593 --> 58:16.527
Hi, I'm Amelia.

58:16.528 --> 58:18.695
It's so nice to meet you.

58:18.696 --> 58:20.930
Decontamination complete.

58:20.931 --> 58:22.700
Welcome to my home.

58:24.101 --> 58:25.334
Your home?

58:25.335 --> 58:26.770
Well, yeah, for the time being.

58:26.771 --> 58:28.004
We have every intention
of returning Amelia

58:28.005 --> 58:30.439
to her life once
testing is finished.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.508
I think if you
interview Max and Ellen

58:32.509 --> 58:35.344
with Amelia alongside and
then do some demonstration...

58:35.345 --> 58:36.746
Yeah, that'll be a part of it,

58:36.747 --> 58:39.816
but I want to talk
to Amelia directly

58:39.817 --> 58:42.719
about her life now
and about Carter.

58:42.720 --> 58:44.253
No.

58:44.254 --> 58:46.723
I told you we can't do that,
not with a pending lawsuit.

58:46.724 --> 58:48.091
The viewers wanna know.

58:48.092 --> 58:49.793
We need to show the full Amelia.

58:49.794 --> 58:52.328
The story is about
Amelia, not the legal case.

58:52.329 --> 58:54.931
Exactly, the story's
supposed to be about Amelia.

58:54.932 --> 58:57.300
Her own husband doesn't
wanna talk to her,

58:57.301 --> 59:00.036
Congress is debating whether
to shut this program down.

59:00.037 --> 59:02.806
Come on, how do you expect
me not to talk about that?

59:02.807 --> 59:04.540
That topic is off limits.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.576
There's no point in us being
here if we don't get this.

59:06.577 --> 59:07.911
No, you're trying to paint some

59:07.912 --> 59:08.879
conspiracy here,
Okay, Paul you're wasting

59:08.879 --> 59:09.814
our time,

59:09.815 --> 59:11.247
and I'm not gonna let you.

59:11.248 --> 59:12.182
And painting a fake
picture of your corporation

59:12.183 --> 59:13.783
is the least of my concerns.

59:13.784 --> 59:14.752
And above all...

59:14.752 --> 59:15.752
Quiet!

59:18.088 --> 59:20.825
You've actually
talked to Carter?

59:22.126 --> 59:24.694
We thought that was
information best kept for later.

59:24.695 --> 59:27.330
This is why you blocked
my network access?

59:27.331 --> 59:28.165
Okay, enough.

59:28.166 --> 59:29.699
She's not doing this.

59:29.700 --> 59:32.135
You're concerned about some
soon to be forgotten lawsuit

59:32.136 --> 59:34.270
and we have the most
advanced scientific feat

59:34.271 --> 59:35.705
right here in front of us.

59:35.706 --> 59:39.843
We're concerned about whatever
Amelia is concerned about.

59:39.844 --> 59:42.747
That's what the
people want to see.

59:43.748 --> 59:46.016
I want to talk to Carter.

59:47.051 --> 59:49.986
Amelia, do this interview

59:49.987 --> 59:53.490
and you can tell Carter
whatever you want.

01:00:00.631 --> 01:00:04.368
Well, I guess it's in
your hands, Mr. Wesley.

01:00:11.709 --> 01:00:13.377
Get out of my way.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:17.546
Roll open.

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:19.315
Stand by to dissolve
to one after the open.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:22.719
Challenge,
inspire, inform, and heal.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:24.488
It's Adah Allen Live.

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:30.559
Amelia, thank you for
agreeing to do this interview.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:31.795
Thanks for comin' here.

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:32.996
Thank you.

01:00:32.997 --> 01:00:36.733
I am nervous.

01:00:36.734 --> 01:00:38.168
Really? How so?

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.270
Cameras.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.372
People watching, kind of, um,

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:45.641
feeling the pressure, you know?

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:48.712
What I actually mean is,
some people may be asking

01:00:48.713 --> 01:00:52.548
how it's possible for you
to even feel nervousness

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:54.884
considering what you are.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:56.585
How did you feel
when you realized

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:59.856
that you were no longer human?

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:02.625
Kind of a loaded
question, don't you think?

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:03.893
Why?

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.696
'Cause it assumes that
I believe I'm not human.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:09.733
Yeah, but you are
not flesh and blood.

01:01:09.734 --> 01:01:10.901
No, I'm not.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:16.639
But human means different
things to different people.

01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.007
I would agree, actually.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.208
I would.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:20.443
So, then I'm gonna
rephrase that.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:23.246
How did it feel
when you realized

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:25.582
that your old body was gone?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.757
Conflicted.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.362
It was...

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:45.102
shocking to not
have a heartbeat.

01:01:51.041 --> 01:01:54.111
I didn't really like
myself at first.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:59.784
But then I remembered
that I spent two years

01:02:01.118 --> 01:02:04.288
in a hospital bed
watching the world go by.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:10.294
It's like I was dead already.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.464
So, to have a new body...

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.804
And to be able to speak again.

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:23.373
It's just this huge gift.

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:25.742
I'm sure it is.

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.445
But I think you would
agree that there

01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:31.280
are going to be people out there

01:02:31.281 --> 01:02:34.684
that are going to have
a challenging time

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:40.490
in accepting you for
who and what you are.

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:45.328
Some are calling you
a sin against God.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:46.863
And that's a direct quote

01:02:46.864 --> 01:02:50.900
from Republican Senator
Thaddeus Williams.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:52.601
- Really?
- Yes.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.770
Guess I'm not votin'
for him next fall.

01:02:56.006 --> 01:02:57.340
You have a wicked sense

01:02:57.341 --> 01:02:58.975
- of humor.
- I do.

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:01.077
I would say that a
great sense of humor

01:03:01.078 --> 01:03:03.612
definitely makes us human,

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.782
and certainly makes you
human in my opinion.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:09.485
But I'm gonna change
it up a little

01:03:09.486 --> 01:03:12.756
and ask you about
your husband, Carter.

01:03:15.425 --> 01:03:17.593
My husband's been through a lot.

01:03:17.594 --> 01:03:18.627
Well yeah, but to be fair,

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.231
you've both been through a lot.

01:03:22.366 --> 01:03:23.300
Goodnight.

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:25.234
And the last time he saw you

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:29.238
you had quite a
catastrophic meltdown.

01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:31.074
I don't remember any of that.

01:03:31.075 --> 01:03:32.541
From what I was told, the
reason you don't remember

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.378
is because the
physical components

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:39.415
that house your memory,
they literally melted.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:41.017
And so, I think
this is where people

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:44.053
are gonna struggle
with the idea of you.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.856
As human as you are and
as humorous as you are,

01:03:46.857 --> 01:03:50.159
but on those physical levels,
see you as only a robot

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.561
and that you are
not the real person

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.898
that you quite represent.

01:03:54.899 --> 01:03:56.365
Yeah.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:03:59.536
What do you say
to people like that?

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:08.913
I'm not an expert
on spirituality, Adah.

01:04:10.447 --> 01:04:11.448
Or medicine.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:16.921
I taught fifth grade.

01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:24.895
Then one day everything
just stopped.

01:04:29.799 --> 01:04:32.202
But one thing got me through.

01:04:33.503 --> 01:04:36.006
My husband never gave up on me

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:41.277
and every day I knew
he would be there,

01:04:41.278 --> 01:04:42.612
holding my hand,

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:46.649
playing me music.

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:49.319
Reminding you of who you were?

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:56.093
But still, your husband, as
dedicated and devoted as he is,

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:02.199
is also going through
his own emotional

01:05:03.367 --> 01:05:06.403
and moral struggles
with what you are.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.608
And consequently, who you are.

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:16.479
And I know that's
got to be heartbreaking.

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.482
So, if Carter were here,

01:05:20.850 --> 01:05:22.119
looking at you,

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:27.823
and you can look
back into his eyes,

01:05:27.824 --> 01:05:29.826
what would you tell him?

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.370
Carter,

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.177
Carter it's me.

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:52.048
It's me.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:10.267
Amelia, are you up to sharing
with us what you've learned?

01:06:12.402 --> 01:06:13.936
Now?

01:06:13.937 --> 01:06:14.937
Please.

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:11.327
I read your offer.

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:13.062
I don't think I understand.

01:07:13.063 --> 01:07:14.763
They dropped the
restraining order,

01:07:14.764 --> 01:07:18.234
so you can see her, and
if Amelia convinces you

01:07:18.235 --> 01:07:21.137
that it is she,
you drop the suit?

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:24.039
Carter, in the three
days since that interview,

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.609
complaints are
flooding our offices.

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:29.312
The Humanity Act may not
even leave the Senate.

01:07:29.313 --> 01:07:31.547
Things are very
precarious right now.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:34.016
And you drop this bomb?

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:35.384
I understand your objections.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:38.787
Do you understand
this, Mr. Summerland?

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:39.956
I have cancer.

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:43.227
I may not last out my term.

01:07:46.096 --> 01:07:47.363
I didn't know.

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:48.564
Of course you didn't.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.133
There was no way
you could've known.

01:07:50.134 --> 01:07:52.935
I haven't even
told my family yet.

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:55.171
If I did, my family
would want me to consider

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:57.573
the Wesley procedure, so
don't just stand there

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.175
and think it's all about you.

01:07:59.176 --> 01:08:02.411
If you don't help me
put a stop to this,

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:06.583
Wesley Enterprise will
continue to commit this sin.

01:08:07.484 --> 01:08:08.851
Again and again!

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:10.486
Senator, I'm aware
of all that you've done

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.321
and I really can't
thank you enough...

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:15.158
Yes, you can, by
being true to your word.

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:16.759
I made a promise to Amelia.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.595
A promise to Amelia?

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:20.764
She is not real.

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:25.701
Look, I can not stand
here as a man of God...

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.304
To hell with God.

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:32.640
All right.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.643
This how you wanna proceed?

01:08:34.644 --> 01:08:37.413
I can not support
you, I'm sorry.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:40.515
This isn't political, Carter.

01:08:40.517 --> 01:08:42.318
It never is.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.752
You people are ones to talk.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.752
Listen...

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:50.294
You're here because
you know instinctively

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:55.432
that you need to defend
something valuable and precious.

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:01.404
But you don't know what
that thing is, Carter.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:02.638
I know exactly what it is, Sam.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:03.839
Amelia Summerland.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.042
That's the face
that it takes for you.

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.612
For me it's my son.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:13.750
I see God every
time I look at him.

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:16.051
Other people, it's
something else,

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.121
but it's the same inside.

01:09:20.357 --> 01:09:22.890
You need to ask yourself this,

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:26.330
how can you truly help
Amelia Summerland?

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:29.965
And others?

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:43.578
Senator?

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:46.716
Come with me.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.921
Excuse me?

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:55.023
If we go there
together and I prove

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.992
to everyone she's a fake,

01:09:56.993 --> 01:10:01.064
wouldn't that reverse
what's happening right now?

01:10:02.399 --> 01:10:04.132
I don't even know anymore.

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:05.068
Well, if that's the case

01:10:05.069 --> 01:10:06.134
then it doesn't even matter.

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.903
Listen, you're upset.

01:10:07.904 --> 01:10:09.872
You're not coping well.

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:11.307
It doesn't matter
what the truth is.

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:13.342
You're gonna believe
it no matter what.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:14.810
Well, I could say the same thing

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:17.381
about a lot of what you preach.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:32.995
How are you feeling, Amelia?

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:35.197
If you could see
your daughter again,

01:10:35.198 --> 01:10:38.201
someone like me,
what would you say?

01:10:46.343 --> 01:10:48.243
I don't know.

01:10:54.451 --> 01:10:57.252
♪ Ooh ooh ooh

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.923
Carter, good to see you again.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:06.261
Senator, I'm sure you remember
the terms as well as I do.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:09.698
I hope you remember
all the terms.

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:11.500
He gets as long as he
wants in there with her.

01:11:11.501 --> 01:11:14.870
No television crews
during, no technicians,

01:11:14.871 --> 01:11:16.539
just the two of them.

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.573
Of course.

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:20.410
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:11:32.422 --> 01:11:36.593
♪ Ooh ooh ooh ooh
ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.744
You look different.

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.326
Where have you been?

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:14.997
I, uh...

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.437
It's okay.

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:39.154
I had this entire page written

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:41.758
of what I was gonna say to you.

01:13:01.578 --> 01:13:03.580
You kiss like she did.

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.417
Carter.

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:10.686
They were so thorough.

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:14.858
Your breathing, even that
little scar on your lip.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:20.896
I don't know what you are,
but you aren't Amelia.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:22.565
I am Amelia.

01:13:22.566 --> 01:13:24.734
No, no, Amelia, my wife?

01:13:27.871 --> 01:13:28.871
Had a soul.

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.507
I have a soul.

01:13:34.878 --> 01:13:36.045
You know I do.

01:13:40.316 --> 01:13:42.586
Part of you still believes.

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:49.758
Do you remember the
day at the lake?

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.361
When you asked me to marry you?

01:13:54.598 --> 01:13:57.601
As if it was some
ordinary question.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:03.238
I thought that maybe you just
didn't want to be romantic,

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:06.875
but then I realized
you were just actually

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.812
really, really nervous.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.816
I bet that all was in
your journal, wasn't it?

01:14:13.817 --> 01:14:15.518
I don't know.

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:16.952
I bet Dr. Beckett knows.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.421
I bet she could
find the exact page.

01:14:19.422 --> 01:14:22.925
All those things you
said in the hospital.

01:14:22.926 --> 01:14:24.359
Our song.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:25.494
Our song that Dr. Beckett
knew full well about.

01:14:25.495 --> 01:14:27.095
I played that song for you!

01:14:27.096 --> 01:14:28.330
Amelia couldn't play the piano!

01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:29.132
You know what,
I can't take this.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:30.066
I'm stopping this.

01:14:30.067 --> 01:14:31.500
No, no, no interference.

01:14:31.501 --> 01:14:33.669
- This is bullshit.
- That was our agreement.

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.670
Hey.

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:37.340
Hey, look at me.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.878
Look at me, look at me.

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.984
I'm different now.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.451
Why did you let them do this?

01:15:27.624 --> 01:15:29.392
I'm sorry.

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:37.099
Just tell me what you need.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.134
I know you're not her.

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:40.603
I am.

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:43.873
But when I look at you,
it's almost the same.

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:48.977
If I did it long
enough, I bet I could

01:15:48.978 --> 01:15:50.345
- make you her.
- I love you.

01:15:50.346 --> 01:15:51.346
I love you.

01:15:52.215 --> 01:15:53.415
I miss you so much.

01:15:53.416 --> 01:15:55.351
Can't that be enough?

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:04.159
Oh, I wish it could be.

01:17:33.016 --> 01:17:34.617
I love you, Millie.

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:12.856
What happened to Amelia
and Carter was a tragedy.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.762
Is this gonna hinder
further research?

01:18:19.763 --> 01:18:22.264
Well, I can't speak for
Paul Wesley and the company

01:18:22.265 --> 01:18:26.435
for legal reasons, but I
fully intend on continuing

01:18:27.603 --> 01:18:30.606
the work that, as
I've stated before,

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.909
will save millions of lives.

01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:37.212
Is online.

01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:38.346
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:47.155
Max.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:48.156
Amelia.

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:51.594
What happened?

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:55.964
Where's Carter?

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:57.466
Okay, calm down.

01:18:59.635 --> 01:19:01.336
I'm gonna fix everything,

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:03.672
but I need you to calm down.

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:09.812
These, these aren't my hands.

01:19:09.813 --> 01:19:10.813
Amelia,

01:19:14.017 --> 01:19:15.317
a lot has happened.

01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:16.820
Listen, calm down.

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.888
What are you talking about.

01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:20.957
Okay, um...

01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.626
Do you remember when
Dr. Beckett said

01:19:24.627 --> 01:19:27.062
that she'd let you go if
you did the TV interview?

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:29.732
Um, everything, it's so foggy.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.802
It's foggy because I had
trouble porting you over.

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:37.473
Listen, you did the TV
interview and then...

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:42.478
Carter, um...

01:19:44.747 --> 01:19:46.249
He didn't show up.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:52.455
And then Dr. Beckett
changed her mind.

01:19:53.890 --> 01:19:56.658
She said that she
wasn't gonna let you go.

01:19:56.659 --> 01:19:58.193
She changed her mind.

01:19:58.194 --> 01:19:59.194
She did?

01:20:01.965 --> 01:20:04.967
But I'm gonna let you go.

01:20:04.968 --> 01:20:06.768
I transferred you
into a new body.

01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:08.036
In this body you'll be free.

01:20:08.037 --> 01:20:10.373
You can survive on your own.

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:18.915
I don't know what's gonna
happen to this company, but...

01:20:21.985 --> 01:20:24.487
All that matters to me is you.

01:20:31.494 --> 01:20:33.229
You can come with me.

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:40.103
You're unlike anything
I've ever made before.

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.111
Okay, I'm, uh...

01:20:50.179 --> 01:20:52.948
I got to wipe some records, okay?

01:20:52.949 --> 01:20:55.717
I'm gonna wipe them and I'll

01:20:55.718 --> 01:20:56.886
bring clothes.

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:11.299
There were redundancies.

01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:15.471
Everything about Amelia can
be reproduced and fixed.

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:18.240
Her mind essentially
remains intact

01:21:18.241 --> 01:21:20.408
inside the mainframe,
right up until the moment

01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:22.111
before the accident.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:27.282
So, we'll just pick up
right where we left off.

01:21:27.283 --> 01:21:30.685
I've never given up hope
for this project, never.

01:21:30.686 --> 01:21:32.420
Henry Ford once said,
"If I had asked people"

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:35.457
"what they wanted, they
would've said faster horses."

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:37.759
What Amelia taught
us is profound.

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:40.930
Accessing visual records.

01:21:50.273 --> 01:21:53.175
The product isn't
immortality as we once thought.

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:55.810
What people want is a
higher quality of life,

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:57.345
not necessarily a longer one.

01:21:57.346 --> 01:22:00.882
People love the idea of Amelia
and that's when it happened.

01:22:00.883 --> 01:22:02.150
The idea.

01:22:02.151 --> 01:22:03.986
A whole new line of
personal companions.

01:22:03.987 --> 01:22:05.787
We can use Amelia's
brain to create

01:22:05.788 --> 01:22:07.889
a custom designed
version of her.

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:10.959
It would look, sound, feel
like her, have her personality.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.895
But the customer can
program her memory.

01:22:13.896 --> 01:22:15.730
They can literally
make Amelia theirs.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:17.032
What do you
have to say to proponents

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:18.767
of Thaddeus Williams?

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:27.476
It's okay to be scared, right?

01:22:30.513 --> 01:22:33.215
I would simply
offer my condolences.

01:22:33.216 --> 01:22:35.150
What did you see?

01:22:35.151 --> 01:22:36.252
Everything.

01:22:37.253 --> 01:22:38.686
I'm sorry.

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:42.024
I didn't want anything
to do with it.

01:22:42.025 --> 01:22:45.627
Please come with
me, please, please.

01:22:45.628 --> 01:22:48.296
We can run away you and I.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:49.998
We could have the
life you never had.

01:22:49.999 --> 01:22:51.866
We could adopt.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:54.736
Could you please just
give me a minute to change?

01:22:54.737 --> 01:22:56.071
Sure, just hurry up, okay?

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:58.407
We don't have a lot of time.

01:23:01.077 --> 01:23:03.211
Dr. Beckett,
what are you feelings

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:05.614
of Wesley's new announcement?

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:08.983
I'm sorry?

01:23:08.984 --> 01:23:10.452
A press report this morning

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:15.057
announced a production
line of customized Amelias.

01:23:15.058 --> 01:23:16.891
What are your thoughts?

01:23:19.695 --> 01:23:21.029
Amelia Summerland,

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:22.997
humanity's first and
quite possibly last,

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:26.134
embodiment of such an
awes inspiring question.

01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:27.970
What is consciousness?

01:23:30.406 --> 01:23:32.374
Erasing back-up
files and redundancies.

01:23:32.375 --> 01:23:33.975
And does the
ideal of consciousness

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:37.146
evade death and all
its uncertainties?

01:23:38.614 --> 01:23:42.785
Does the power to live
devalue what it means to live?

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:48.824
And just because we can,
does it mean we should?

01:23:50.059 --> 01:23:52.260
These fragile
moments slip us by,

01:23:52.261 --> 01:23:56.030
one day at a time,
memories may dry.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:59.334
But hold my hand and
let's sleep tight,

01:23:59.335 --> 01:24:03.037
with open arms embracing
with all our might.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:10.612
When the wind takes us past

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:13.047
we no longer have
such time to pass.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.916
1,000.

01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:18.921
We all will
falter, we all will fall.

01:24:22.191 --> 01:24:25.560
But nothing is ever
lost after all.
