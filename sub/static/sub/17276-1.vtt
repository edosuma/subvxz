00:27.542 --> 00:29.783
 I'm awake. </ i>

00:32.625 --> 00:35.947
FIRST SEMESTER

00:36.167 --> 00:39.034
I'd been feeling bad. </ i>

00:41.917 --> 00:45.159
 My heart beats like a bongo drum. </ i>

00:58.042 --> 01:01.864
 Dad tries to beat neighbor </ i>
 dog to death with insecticide. </ i>

01:07.125 --> 01:10.197
 Mother do not think it is a good idea. </ i>

01:13.833 --> 01:17.121
 Maybe it's not so </ i>
 bad to go to boarding school. </ i>

02:24.125 --> 02:27.572
 I had hoped, </ i>
 that we would fit. </ i>

02:31.917 --> 02:36.411
 But it feels like, </ i>
 the circus has come to town. </ i>

02:44.792 --> 02:49.456
He is a real little cricket star
and has received a scholarship.

02:49.667 --> 02:54.411
And he sings like an angel.
Is not that right, honey?

02:54.625 --> 02:58.743
- Choirmaster.
- I like choirboys.

03:01.625 --> 03:04.742
Look here!

03:10.583 --> 03:12.824
That's fine, what?

03:13.042 --> 03:18.036
 My new home. It smells like </ i>
 foot odor and floor polish. </ i>

03:20.625 --> 03:23.867
Calm down!

03:25.500 --> 03:28.617
 I'll never fit. </ i>

03:30.958 --> 03:33.916
 I am after all not the only one. </ i>

03:39.083 --> 03:41.916
There are many blacks here.

03:43.167 --> 03:45.909
Quiet, please.

03:46.125 --> 03:51.916
Good morning, boys and your parents.
I am president ...

03:52.125 --> 03:56.949
 - Rector. Nicknames "Glock". </ I>
 - My name is mr. Glockenspheel. </ I>

03:59.625 --> 04:04.198
 - It is not something to laugh at. </ i>
 - I love you so much! </ i>

04:06.083 --> 04:09.371
Lie never be anything.

04:09.625 --> 04:13.163
Even the Queen must
damn once a day.

04:18.125 --> 04:21.868
Goodbye, darling!
I will miss you.

04:33.458 --> 04:36.450
 Tomorrow it begins. </ i>

04:36.625 --> 04:40.823
 Perhaps I die during the night, </ i>
 and get rid of it. </ i>

04:41.958 --> 04:44.700
Turn off the light!

04:57.042 --> 04:59.624
Mother?

05:28.500 --> 05:34.450
What have we here? It looks like
one silkworms with eating disorder.

05:34.667 --> 05:39.366
It looks like a potato,
a small spud! </ i>

05:45.625 --> 05:48.037
 Everybody has a nickname. </ i>

05:48.250 --> 05:53.620
My is Spud. My dick is small, </ i>
 and my nuts are not dropped. </ i>

06:00.500 --> 06:06.075
 If I have to survive here, </ i>
 I have become friends with the other. </ i>

06:06.292 --> 06:12.208
 Especially with Robert Black - "Rambo", </ i>
 dormitory self-proclaimed king. </ i>

06:12.375 --> 06:15.412
 He gangs in every sentence-</ i>

06:15.625 --> 06:19.368
 - and demands to be </ i>
 respected and honored. </ i>

06:20.917 --> 06:26.116
 I have become friends with Rambos </ i>
 gang, for example, Charlie Hooper ... </ i>

06:27.458 --> 06:34.159
 ... "The mad dog". His hobby </ i>
 is destruction and death. </ i>

06:34.625 --> 06:41.155
 Or should I be sports star </ i>
 as Simon Brown - "Simon Brown". </ i>

06:41.375 --> 06:44.913
 Or I can get my hands on a lot </ i>
 prohibited girlie-</ i>

06:45.125 --> 06:48.913
 - as Al Greenstein - "barrel". </ i>

06:49.125 --> 06:54.040
 He is a sexgalning, </ i>
 which I think is a good thing. </ i>

07:12.458 --> 07:15.700
 Or should I beat </ i>
 school farting record. </ i>

07:20.583 --> 07:24.906
 held by </ i>
 Sidney Sibeko-Scott - "Cool". </ i>

07:26.250 --> 07:30.823
 Thanks for Henry Barker </ i>
 - "Gekko". </ i>

07:33.000 --> 07:39.621
 Vern Blackadder - "Rain Man". </ i>
 Otherwise, they bullied me. </ i>

07:46.750 --> 07:49.742
 My new home is like a war zone. </ i>

07:51.125 --> 07:55.368
I'd been an uncomfortable feeling </ i>
 that soon it's my turn. </ i>

07:57.792 --> 08:02.411
 - All calls us "The crazy eight". </ i>
 - What's going on here?! </ i>

08:14.417 --> 08:17.250
Who started it?

08:22.458 --> 08:25.120
- What's your name?
- John Milton.

08:25.333 --> 08:29.326
- John Milton, sir!
- John Milton, sir.

08:29.542 --> 08:32.328
U d with language.

08:33.542 --> 08:36.864
I really do not know.

08:39.457 --> 08:41.914
As you will ...

08:42.125 --> 08:48.451
From now on, all
your privileges revoked.

08:48.667 --> 08:54.583
Next time I'm not so indulgent.
Go with him to the doctor.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.449
It was not your fault.

09:04.667 --> 09:11.994
 It was not good to be seen with </ i>
 Gekko, the school's most stupid guy. </ i>

09:17.667 --> 09:19.874
It's a madhouse.

09:20.083 --> 09:25.407
There is always someone who is
after you or mock you.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.537
Do not you think Milton?

09:35.708 --> 09:38.825
This better be serious.

09:41.708 --> 09:44.575
Thank you, Milton.

09:46.875 --> 09:50.242
DIE NOT HERE
IT SHOULD I DO IN HOLIDAY

09:55.125 --> 09:58.663
Check them right there!

10:21.333 --> 10:25.121
I do not recall,
to have invited you, Spud.

10:26.208 --> 10:30.998
He could not tear it off for so
he had tweezers and magnifying glass.

10:31.208 --> 10:37.124
- Even if he had a map.
- Balls feel lonely.

10:44.875 --> 10:49.448
 It is not fair. </ i>
 Even Gekko has got hair on. </ i>

10:51.250 --> 10:54.538
 I wonder when I can </ i>
 begin to tear it off? </ i>

11:01.500 --> 11:06.324
 - I wonder how suicide feels? </ i>
 - This is my seven tenders: </ i>

11:06.333 --> 11:11.578
 - Mr. Wilson, our teacher. </ i>
 - 1 I must obey the authorities. </ I>

11:11.792 --> 11:16.491
 - "rib." </ i>
 - 2 You must not behave indecently. </ I>

11:16.708 --> 11:20.496
 Rambo told that a lion bed </ i>
 half of his shoulder by. </ i>

11:20.708 --> 11:24.906
 doctors had to use a </ i>
 ribs to make it. </ i>

11:28.583 --> 11:34.283
5th I do not play with yourself
or with each other.

11:34.292 --> 11:40.242
- 6 I can not play darts.
 - There is no dart boards. </ i>

11:40.250 --> 11:44.072
7th Consider not even
To do this ...

11:44.292 --> 11:47.580
You must not jump into the water at night.

11:49.625 --> 11:53.618
 school starts. I have no idea </ i>
 where things are. </ i>

11:54.625 --> 12:00.040
 I become terrified when </ i>
 call. I do not know what to do. </ I>

12:00.250 --> 12:05.199
 I felt a lump in my throat, </ i>
 and was about to start crying. </ i>

12:05.208 --> 12:09.281
 - PJ Luthuli, our teacher. </ I>
 - Do not run here. </ i>

12:09.500 --> 12:13.539
 This is the first time I've been </ i>
 orders from a black man. </ i>

12:13.750 --> 12:17.447
- I'm lost.
- This road.

12:18.542 --> 12:22.490
 Dad would have reconsidered, </ i>
 the wallet was still there. </ i>

12:45.958 --> 12:48.040
Good God.

12:49.958 --> 12:54.452
Oh horror, oh horror!

12:54.625 --> 13:00.575
The heart can not understand it ...
you are quite dumb ...

13:00.792 --> 13:03.579
Let the trumpets speak!

13:03.792 --> 13:08.582
These vocal messengers-

13:08.792 --> 13:12.831
- Of blood and death!

13:16.083 --> 13:18.950
With me, study the literature.

13:19.125 --> 13:22.993
Not the anemic nonsense-

13:23.208 --> 13:26.575
- A self-absorbed literary gay.
Example 1:

13:30.125 --> 13:32.662
Henry James.

13:34.083 --> 13:39.498
Example 2:
Virginia Woolf and Agatha Christie.

13:39.667 --> 13:45.037
Frustrated and sex-mad lesbians
with underarm hair.

13:48.125 --> 13:53.950
Not get me wrong, boys.
I have nothing against lesbians.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.080
I would personally
give them a swing.

13:58.292 --> 14:03.992
 Mr. Edly - "Head". He is as </ i>
 mad as my family, maybe more. </ i>

14:04.208 --> 14:10.283
Either way, I get to
teach you smelly suri cat

14:10.500 --> 14:17.576
- How to become men.
You will learn about women and sex.

14:18.583 --> 14:25.034
If I do it well, you become the
kind of men that you envy-

14:25.042 --> 14:30.867
- And the kind of men
that women can not resist.

14:33.583 --> 14:37.326
 Literature is my favorite. </ i>

14:39.125 --> 14:43.289
 Just Head teaches me to score girls </ i>
 as mrs. Wilson, rib wife. </ I>

14:43.500 --> 14:48.915
 nickname "Eve" </ i>
 since Eve came from Adam's rib. </ i>

14:49.125 --> 14:55.041
 I got almost goosebumps. </ i>
 I was about to pee in my pants! </ i>

14:58.125 --> 15:02.073
- Yes, Robert?
- You lost your pencil.

15:14.833 --> 15:20.908
 Thursday is movie night. Today, </ i>
 "Pretty Woman" with Julia Roberts. </ i>

15:21.083 --> 15:24.496
 She plays a sexy prostitute. </ i>

15:24.708 --> 15:30.658
 After school, I would drive around and </ i>
 look for prostitutes. </ i>

15:38.250 --> 15:41.287
You can watch the movie later.

15:41.500 --> 15:45.743
 President F. W. de Klerk </ i>
 opened parliament-</ i>

15:45.958 --> 15:50.873
 - with what is described </ i>
, an epoch-making speech. </ i>

15:51.083 --> 15:56.032
Among other things, increased ban </ i>
 against African National Congress. </ i>

15:56.250 --> 16:02.871
 Father says that the ANC's communists. </ i>
 I'm terrified of them. </ i>

16:03.083 --> 16:08.828
 government has decided </ i>
 to release mr. Mandela. </ I>

16:10.000 --> 16:12.958
 I wonder if </ i>
 Mandela was a Spud? </ i>

16:13.167 --> 16:16.705
There goes the country!

16:16.875 --> 16:20.538
 Pike, the school bully. </ i>

16:36.750 --> 16:39.867
 P. J. Luthuli is my new idol. </ I>

16:41.417 --> 16:46.286
 I suddenly bad </ i>
 guilty about being white. </ i>

16:50.042 --> 16:52.909
 My quest for sporting success </ i>
 do not go so well. </ i>

16:52.917 --> 16:57.866
Your defense game is just as
through the hole like a whore panties.

17:08.666 --> 17:14.821
In the worst players,
I have been unfortunate enough to train.

17:15.041 --> 17:21.992
I have a greater chance of being
pregnant than being cricketers.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.913
It's time for lunch,
so get with you.

17:28.333 --> 17:32.406
Rain Man and Spud,
rode my bed.

17:35.375 --> 17:41.575
Spud, do you want all at school
must think you're a sissy?

17:43.375 --> 17:46.367
It did not expect to.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.822
And therefore I with a mission.

17:53.042 --> 17:57.536
It becomes dangerous.
It gets crazy.

17:57.750 --> 18:02.870
We can be kicked out of school.
We may even die.

18:04.417 --> 18:10.492
Who is on a prohibited
completely mad dip?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.870
I will not.

18:21.917 --> 18:26.490
But Gekko,
there must be no witnesses.

18:26.667 --> 18:29.579
One for all, all for one.

18:29.792 --> 18:33.330
- Spud?
- No witnesses.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.324
Spud!

20:54.458 --> 20:55.743
Wait!

21:21.250 --> 21:23.707
We did it!

21:43.083 --> 21:46.951
Guys! Where's Cool?

22:00.792 --> 22:03.408
Guys ...

22:07.375 --> 22:10.663
Try to get him free.

22:30.208 --> 22:33.325
Good grief! We get kicked out.

22:33.542 --> 22:37.660
Shut up! We will not be thrown out.

22:37.667 --> 22:41.455
Do not be such a sissy.

23:35.833 --> 23:38.495
 Rambo saved the day. </ i>

23:38.500 --> 23:45.531
 He said that Fede was stuck because </ i>
 he would visit the Holy Spirit. </ i>

23:51.583 --> 23:54.325
It's a miracle!

24:07.292 --> 24:11.285
- Well done.
- Establishing!

24:18.500 --> 24:23.073
I know exactly
what I had last night.

24:26.542 --> 24:32.617
What do you think? We were sleeping.
Ask anyone of us.

24:36.417 --> 24:40.205
Okay? Is it true Milton?

24:43.833 --> 24:46.950
A boy was close to death!

24:47.167 --> 24:51.706
Train in a dip, or did not you?

24:59.125 --> 25:02.993
Six strokes for each of you,
when I come back after the weekend.

25:03.167 --> 25:07.115
Take care,
I will think of you.

25:08.417 --> 25:12.114
Super ... Thank you, Spud.

25:20.750 --> 25:24.663
 The 158 km long trip home </ i>
 felt infinite </ i>

25:24.875 --> 25:28.117
 - and fattened breath smelled of fish. </ i>

25:28.333 --> 25:31.871
 did nothing, </ i>
 I was on my way home. </ i>

25:40.292 --> 25:46.663
Get into the car. Your father is gone
mad. I kill him.

25:47.500 --> 25:53.200
 Mother not exaggerating. Dad has built </ i>
 our house into a bunker. </ i>

25:58.167 --> 26:02.035
Open the gate!
What is this all about?!

26:02.250 --> 26:07.699
Marge and Denise from book club will
by! How do they come in?

26:07.917 --> 26:11.535
- Remove barbed wire!
- So are we vulnerable to attack!

26:11.750 --> 26:15.413
- From who?!
- Communists!

26:20.292 --> 26:23.659
 Maybe the school is not so bad. </ i>

26:24.375 --> 26:30.416
 Dad was mad. He says that </ i>
 we will live in poverty. </ i>

26:30.625 --> 26:35.949
 He fired Innocence. </ i>
 He thinks she is a terrorist. </ i>

26:56.750 --> 27:00.493
 Is it really to live in poverty? </ i>

27:05.375 --> 27:07.457
 And then I saw her. </ i>

27:07.667 --> 27:13.822
 - There for a lightning bolt through my body. </ i>
 - This is Marge's daughter, Debbie. </ i>

27:14.000 --> 27:18.824
 She said a single word, which almost </ i>
 knocked me over with its beauty. </ i>

27:19.000 --> 27:22.492
I promised Debs,
that she could swim in your pool.

27:46.417 --> 27:49.250
Jump in, Johnny, it's hot.

28:42.375 --> 28:45.742
 I'm in love with a mermaid. </ i>

28:54.583 --> 28:58.826
- I'm really sorry.
- Forget it!

29:08.958 --> 29:11.074
Next!

29:20.000 --> 29:24.198
Think about what you love most,
so overcomes you pain.

29:30.292 --> 29:32.328
Next!

29:37.292 --> 29:39.624
Bend forward.

29:43.292 --> 29:45.783
Jacket.

29:47.667 --> 29:50.374
It's going to hurt.

30:07.250 --> 30:10.117
 Kiss me, John. </ i>

30:33.318 --> 30:40.541
If we is </ i> destined to die, it is
enough to constitute a loss to the country

30:40.542 --> 30:46.742
And if life's undes, the fewer men,
the greater part of the credit

30:46.917 --> 30:49.784
We few, we happy few, we brothers all

30:50.000 --> 30:56.155
For he who today share his blood with
me shall be my brother

30:59.750 --> 31:02.742
Would you repeat that, sir?

31:06.042 --> 31:08.328
Come on, Johnny!

31:11.083 --> 31:14.155
That's my boy!

31:17.417 --> 31:20.489
Do not play smart.

31:42.000 --> 31:46.949
Two rim if you gramser,
five if you take her on breast-

31:47.167 --> 31:52.207
- And ten, if you touch her
the most holy place.

31:52.375 --> 31:57.745
- It costs five to be with.
- I'm with.

32:53.042 --> 32:58.833
I save the worst for last ... </ i>
Stand up, Milton.

33:02.750 --> 33:08.074
This young man is a good example
on what women crave.

33:08.292 --> 33:12.991
He is the only one of you fools-

33:13.208 --> 33:17.076
- Who has scored more
than 50% of the job.

33:17.083 --> 33:19.995
You can sit down.

33:20.000 --> 33:24.039
I had to write about influence
in modern literature.

33:24.042 --> 33:28.365
Is this it </ i> best you baboons
For the?

33:29.583 --> 33:36.989
Dumped. Not one of you came in.
the greatest influence of all.

33:37.208 --> 33:40.905
If it were not for sex, adultery-

33:41.125 --> 33:46.245
- Fornication, korpulering and knalderi-

33:46.458 --> 33:50.497
- There would never have been
written a single book.

33:52.958 --> 33:58.203
- But what about the Bible?
- Good question.

33:58.375 --> 34:01.617
Milton! Bible ...

34:01.833 --> 34:05.030
Clean or sexy?

34:09.875 --> 34:15.699
Grandma says that it is full of sodomy
and incest, and should be banned for children.

34:15.875 --> 34:18.331
Exactly!

34:18.542 --> 34:22.205
Well, I puberty monkeys.
 Auf Wiedersehen! </ i>

34:25.750 --> 34:28.992
- John ...
- Yes, sir?

34:29.208 --> 34:32.871
Welcome to Paradise Lost.

34:32.875 --> 34:37.869
Your grandmother sounds to be
an interesting slut.

34:37.875 --> 34:44.326
Yes, sir. She is potty. She calls
me David, and we call her Wombat.

34:44.542 --> 34:48.489
My whole family
is actually quite crazy.

34:48.708 --> 34:51.871
So I have the perfect book for you.

34:52.042 --> 34:56.114
It is not really a book,
it's a play.

34:56.333 --> 34:59.655
It's called "The absurd drama".

35:02.958 --> 35:06.576
- Thank you, sir.
- Do not thank me, just read it!

35:06.750 --> 35:10.914
So can you tell us what you think.
I think it is fantastic.

35:11.833 --> 35:15.872
- Get out now, there is lunch.
- Yes, sir.

35:24.833 --> 35:30.078
 I hoped that the play would </ i>
 act on how scores. </ i>

35:30.292 --> 35:34.615
 But it is about two tramps, </ i>
 living in a ditch. </ i>

35:34.833 --> 35:38.075
 They are waiting for a man, </ i>
 named Godot. </ i>

35:38.292 --> 35:43.161
 But he never arrived. </ i>
 It's creepy strange. </ i>

35:54.333 --> 35:59.373
SCHOOL game becomes "OLIVER
TWIST. "TEST TOMORROW

36:27.375 --> 36:31.744
 This is it. </ i>
 Robert de Niro, beware! </ i>

36:44.708 --> 36:48.781
- Are you satisfied, John?
- Yes, ma'am.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.579
You can call me "Marion".

36:53.833 --> 36:58.327
Who is the
happiest old idiot in the world?

37:07.708 --> 37:12.657
- Now you have no more wine!
- Last glasses, I promise.

37:14.667 --> 37:21.243
Relax, you're stiff as a stick.
Drink a little wine.

37:21.458 --> 37:25.622
- I have not.
- Nonsense. What do you think?

37:28.000 --> 37:31.242
- About what?
- Drama.

37:38.667 --> 37:41.534
I do not know.

37:41.750 --> 37:44.583
Oh, Johnno ...

37:45.000 --> 37:50.120
I guess I do not have to yell at you?
Tell Just.

37:55.292 --> 37:58.739
- Nothing happens.
- Exactly.

37:58.958 --> 38:02.200
It's like life.

38:02.417 --> 38:07.787
We are waiting for something to happen,
but it does not.

38:07.792 --> 38:13.707
And what are we waiting for?
God? The meaning of life?

38:13.708 --> 38:15.790
Death?

38:21.792 --> 38:25.284
Perhaps we are waiting to become adults.

38:26.625 --> 38:29.662
But it will never be.

38:29.833 --> 38:33.655
Wise words, young man.
Let's drink to it.

38:37.542 --> 38:42.115
Why is it absurd?
The sound normal.

38:42.333 --> 38:48.909
We are sitting here surrounded
of a kind of fantasy world.

38:49.125 --> 38:55.200
The actual absurd is that most
not seem to notice it.

38:55.417 --> 39:02.368
- The school is the most absurd world.
- And I've taught here for 27 years.

39:02.583 --> 39:07.828
An absurd vagrant in a ditch ...

39:09.458 --> 39:12.530
... The wayside.

39:18.042 --> 39:24.038
My mother believes that God's greatest gift
to humanity's freedom of choice.

39:24.250 --> 39:27.697
It is not something
one should take lightly.

39:34.583 --> 39:41.113
This is undoubtedly
the best book that is written.

39:41.333 --> 39:46.407
It is proof
that God indeed exists.

39:46.625 --> 39:50.618
These are strong words
from a devout atheist.

39:54.625 --> 39:58.413
To be </ i> or not,
this is the case.

39:58.625 --> 40:05.281
Is it a nobler mind that withstands
the wild fate arrows shot ...

40:05.500 --> 40:09.493
John ... You must display home now.

40:09.708 --> 40:13.530
Arrows Target ...

40:13.542 --> 40:19.037
- What is it, honey?
- An end, we sincerely may desire.

40:38.208 --> 40:40.824
Pathetic! Next!

40:48.583 --> 40:53.247
- Well, Milton, what would you sing?
- Amazing Grace.

41:09.792 --> 41:12.659
Thank you! Next!

41:13.875 --> 41:16.491
Thank you, Milton.

41:59.417 --> 42:04.866
 I feel just like Hobbit </ i>
 - small and lonely. </ i>

42:05.083 --> 42:07.950
 Just less hairy. </ i>

42:20.542 --> 42:23.454
HOLIDAY

42:26.542 --> 42:32.583
 holidays. All that before made me </ i>
 happy does not mean anything anymore. </ i>

42:32.792 --> 42:37.456
 I needed a plan, </ i>
 but could not find anything. </ i>

42:37.458 --> 42:43.158
 Innocence is back. </ i>
 She pulled father in law. </ i>

42:43.375 --> 42:46.617
- I told you.
 - Now she sits in power. </ i>

42:46.833 --> 42:50.451
Ask them there.

42:52.542 --> 42:59.198
 Wombat to eat lunch with us. </ i>
 Father says she is a part of satan. </ i>

42:59.375 --> 43:02.242
She is a part of satan!

43:07.708 --> 43:11.371
It's eleven.
You can not be there all day.

43:11.375 --> 43:16.119
Have not you got yourself some friends,
you can invite over?

43:16.333 --> 43:21.157
I ask Debbie,
if she wants to and baths.

43:42.083 --> 43:44.324
Hey.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.447
 Was it really wise to let </ i>
 mermaid meet my family? </ i>

43:55.667 --> 43:58.830
Get now not busted bitch thick.

44:01.375 --> 44:07.416
David is such a pretty boy.
Thank God he looks like not his father.

44:07.625 --> 44:11.538
I do not understand,
why you married him.

44:11.708 --> 44:14.575
He looks like scrambled eggs in the face.

44:15.625 --> 44:18.287
What are you doing?

44:23.167 --> 44:28.366
 I was sure that the mermaid </ i>
 would never see us again. </ i>

44:35.625 --> 44:38.458
What is it that is so funny?

44:40.208 --> 44:43.371
 I talked about school </ i>
 and the crazy eight. </ i>

44:43.583 --> 44:48.373
 She laughed really very </ i>

44:55.083 --> 45:01.329
 I just had to kiss her. So </ i>
 I could tell the others. </ i>

45:04.250 --> 45:08.493
 Now it's confirmed. </ i>
 Spud Milton has no balls. </ i>

45:08.708 --> 45:11.324
SECOND SEMESTER

45:11.542 --> 45:14.614
 must change to. </ i>

45:14.833 --> 45:18.826
 This semester, </ i>
 where Spud Milton enters into character. </ i>

45:31.625 --> 45:38.201
 I had to give Gekko a </ i>
 gift. It is a tradition at the school. </ I>

45:58.750 --> 46:02.698
 I helped </ i>
 making fun of barrel. </ i>

46:20.417 --> 46:24.911
 I joined </ i>
 African company. </ i>

46:32.125 --> 46:38.041
I'm embarrassed to be white. After
school I will be freedom fighter.

46:38.208 --> 46:44.249
Do not be silly. When you have gone out
of school, the battle ended long ago.

46:44.458 --> 46:49.157
Thank you, Milton.
We need more of your casting.

46:49.375 --> 46:52.742
 I think I prefer black now. </ i>

46:52.958 --> 46:57.247
 Dad would probably call me </ i>
 a damn communist. </ i>

47:00.042 --> 47:03.284
 I will sing again. </ i>

47:03.500 --> 47:08.119
 Although music teacher </ i>
 has written new songs. </ i>

47:56.417 --> 48:02.788
The role of Oliver Twist
be played by John Milton.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.742
Congratulations.

48:30.667 --> 48:37.072
Spud, the boys and I just
to congratulate you ... birthday.

49:47.333 --> 49:51.497
 I was born 14 years ago. </ i>
 in minutes. </ i>

49:53.042 --> 49:58.332
 it was my mother who had </ i>
 endure the pain and the bright light. </ i>

50:02.917 --> 50:05.704
 Now it at least over. </ i>

50:10.958 --> 50:13.870
Are you okay?

50:17.958 --> 50:22.998
I am going to run with tight
reins tighter than nun pussy.

50:23.208 --> 50:26.371
This is not
a piece of cotton wool school theater.

50:26.583 --> 50:31.202
This paragraph should be as well,
that it can be carried anywhere.

50:54.042 --> 50:57.000
I require creativity!

50:58.750 --> 51:01.412
Try it, Milton.

51:05.208 --> 51:08.075
Yes, exactly!

51:12.917 --> 51:17.911
 - It did not start too well. </ i>
 - Stop, stop, stop! </ i>

51:18.125 --> 51:21.242
 Mr. Richardson - "Viking". </ I>

51:21.417 --> 51:28.368
 Last year he had a heart attack </ i>
 in "Pirates of Penzance". </ i>

51:28.583 --> 51:34.158
 chief plays Fagin. But he fills </ i>
 his hip flask with real whiskey. </ i>

51:34.917 --> 51:38.205
 Eva plays the prostitutes Nancy. </ i>

51:38.417 --> 51:42.581
Everyone hopes that she will be dressed
out </ i> like a real whore. </ i>

51:43.000 --> 51:46.743
 Gekko was assistant ... </ i>

51:47.875 --> 51:51.197
 He is probably the infirmary </ i>
 rest of their lives. </ i>

51:51.417 --> 51:54.864
 Glock player Sykes, psychopath. </ i>

51:58.833 --> 52:01.905
 Talk about the right for the role. </ i>

52:01.917 --> 52:05.865
- Are you okay?
- I just play.

52:06.083 --> 52:08.495
Very convincing.

52:27.208 --> 52:32.908
- If you say anything, I'll kill you.
- About what?

53:02.417 --> 53:04.783
 Rugby Season. </ i>

53:09.458 --> 53:12.468
 I wonder if "Oliver Twist" </ i>
 get the same response? </ i>

53:14.708 --> 53:18.701
 Not like the response to my team. </ i>

53:18.917 --> 53:25.538
 But it may be that coach </ i>
 is mr. Lilly, visual arts teacher. </ I>

53:25.750 --> 53:28.787
 He does not believe in tackles. </ i>

53:28.792 --> 53:32.740
Much better! More pressure from the rear.

53:43.875 --> 53:46.082
They have arrived!

54:22.375 --> 54:27.665
I'll probably all say hello
girls from St. Catherine welcome.

54:27.833 --> 54:30.825
Quiet! - Amanda.

54:32.625 --> 54:37.665
Amanda plays Beth.
- John Milton plays Oliver.

54:41.500 --> 54:46.620
 Amanda Lawrence, </ i>
 too beautiful to have a nickname. </ i>

54:47.833 --> 54:52.327
 I am totally scared of her. </ i>

54:53.917 --> 54:59.241
I know your dirty little minds,
and I do not accept it.

54:59.458 --> 55:03.827
Neither flirting, gramseri, petting,
kissing or worse.

55:09.750 --> 55:13.789
- It is the best book I have read.
- Wonderful!

55:13.792 --> 55:18.661
What book! More exciting
than a bed full of blondes.

55:24.583 --> 55:30.624
- I would ask for another book ...
- I've gotten a monster loose!

55:30.833 --> 55:36.578
- "Prophecies" of Nostradamus.
- I know who wrote it.

55:36.792 --> 55:42.947
What is this all about? You try well
not to impress private school chick?

55:43.125 --> 55:47.243
I saw how you looked at her.

55:48.917 --> 55:52.159
I can not let worse.

55:52.375 --> 55:57.369
If she read such nonsense,
Do you try to avoid her.

55:57.583 --> 56:03.658
If you do not smoke in bed with at least
half, it is too slack of you.

56:06.042 --> 56:09.000
- I can not.
- Why not?

56:11.417 --> 56:14.124
I'm just a spud. </ I>

56:17.750 --> 56:24.781
You must show everyone that you have
down, not is </ i> the only thing that counts.

56:33.083 --> 56:37.452
I know a book
that can get you on the right track.

56:43.583 --> 56:46.905
This one does matter.

56:50.875 --> 56:56.040
- What's it about?
- To give a shit about what others think.

56:56.250 --> 57:01.574
People make a choice,
and shit on the consequences.

57:05.583 --> 57:09.371
What did I tell you about the wine?

57:10.167 --> 57:13.580
It is best that you go now.

57:17.542 --> 57:19.658
Milton ...

57:21.667 --> 57:25.455
I was also called Spud at school.

57:27.833 --> 57:31.906
But it took me probably not harm?

58:14.458 --> 58:16.540
Hello?

58:19.833 --> 58:23.155
 Johnny, is that you? </ i>

58:26.958 --> 58:29.995
- Hello.
- Johnny! How are you?

58:33.083 --> 58:36.530
Slip, Spud, I should call.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.412
Johnny?

58:59.917 --> 59:05.082
- Have you read?
- Nostradamus is a deluded fool.

59:08.625 --> 59:12.197
Why are you called Spud?

59:12.417 --> 59:16.581
Does it have anything
with a potato to do?

59:16.792 --> 59:21.081
- I have to move.
- Come on, it's us now.

01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.870
Just vote is not in transition!

01:00:10.083 --> 01:00:16.409
 No one knows what is wrong. </ i>
 I hope it's over with Spud. </ i>

01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:32.826
- Four sneeze is like an orgasm.
- Hopefully an orgasm better.

01:00:36.708 --> 01:00:39.666
 Gekko's actually pretty cool. </ i>

01:00:39.875 --> 01:00:44.869
 He has had 42 diseases, </ i>
 six of which are completely unknown. </ i>

01:00:45.083 --> 01:00:48.701
 And he takes </ i>
 12 different kinds of medicine. </ i>

01:01:05.292 --> 01:01:09.365
 To my beloved spud. </ i>
 Come to recover. </ i>

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:13.414
 I miss you. Love you. Amanda. </ I>

01:01:26.375 --> 01:01:31.824
You ... we can well make it clear
she loves you.

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:37.827
- Do you believe it?
- Imagine if you score Amanda!

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:41.739
 spud is to Tyr. </ i>

01:02:06.917 --> 01:02:09.989
Spud ...

01:02:10.208 --> 01:02:13.405
When you sing ...

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:18.072
It's as if ...

01:02:20.292 --> 01:02:25.332
I do not know.
It may sound weird ... </ i>

01:02:27.625 --> 01:02:31.573
It is as if,
I so know that God might exist.

01:02:52.042 --> 01:02:56.240
- It's just a cold.
- The voice is not in transition?

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:59.322
He has a long way to go.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.699
Hey.

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:24.702
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:03:39.958 --> 01:03:44.907
Once again from the beginning
with a hair dryer and the terminal?

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:14.909
She signed with the "love".

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:19.619
This does not always the same.
Girls often say "love".

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:26.118
"I love the dress, I love
Tom Cruise! I love Bananarama! "

01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:32.665
- Forget the girls. Who comes first!
- Where are we going?

01:04:55.792 --> 01:05:01.708
The view of hell ... </ i> is the
best place to view the school from.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:19.948
THIRD SEMESTER
(Simpleton PERIOD)

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:24.786
 Apparently I am not the only one </ i>
 which is being kulret. </ i>

01:05:26.083 --> 01:05:31.032
 barrel traded Thursday film </ i>
 out with lesbian porn. </ i>

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:41.993
Vern was caught stealing everyone's </ i> 414 undies.
Rambo was crazy. </ I> 01:05:43,750 -> 01:05:48,790

01:05:50.167 --> 01:05:53.897
 Obese came out for an accident </ i>
 when he would beat his fart record. </ i>

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:04.120
 Gekko was attacked </ i>
 of a rare parasite. </ i>

01:06:04.333 --> 01:06:07.621
 The Mad Dog says, </ i>
 that he got it from fattened farts. </ i>

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:11.143
 Everyone knows that Rambo and Eve </ i>
 have something going. </ i>

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.496
 Apart from poor rib. </ i>

01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:18.364
 Pike continues to ravage. </ i>

01:06:26.125 --> 01:06:29.117
 I could not stop </ i>
 to dream. </ i>

01:06:37.167 --> 01:06:40.284
 I'm going crazy! </ i>

01:06:42.125 --> 01:06:47.791
The big question is:
Which one would you fuck?

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.072
I can not fuck any of them.

01:06:51.292 --> 01:06:56.036
- I'm a spud.
- I know what to do.

01:06:56.042 --> 01:07:02.447
Gekko thinks he knows everything about women,
</ i> without ever having received a kiss! </ i>

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:08.788
So I should ignore Amanda,
be really part against her-

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.037
- And flirting uninhibited with Christine?

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:19.908
- Christine's pretty creepy.
- You must win Amanda's respect.

01:08:05.292 --> 01:08:08.955
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Christine ...

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:21.703
See you, honey.

01:08:37.917 --> 01:08:41.830
 Why are you so arrogant? </ i>

01:08:42.042 --> 01:08:45.580
 You're not who I thought you were. </ i>
 Amanda. </ i>

01:08:47.542 --> 01:08:52.787
She hates me! And I flirt
with one, I do not know.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:58.040
I'm the girl incredible that as the
only one has been kind to me.

01:08:58.250 --> 01:09:03.916
Make it something that I take Christine?
I think she likes me.

01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:09.707
We have already gramset below the stage.
Is it okay?

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:14.616
- Of course, you're welcome.
- Thank you.

01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:22.322
- What are you on holiday?
- Nothing. And you?

01:09:22.542 --> 01:09:26.535
I should be with
my boyfriend - Christine.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:30.447
We need to Mozambique.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:33.988
- For Christine ...
- Yes?

01:09:34.167 --> 01:09:38.706
- It's nothing.
- Check out these malaria tablets.

01:09:38.917 --> 01:09:45.823
I never take a pill again.
My new medicine is love.

01:09:47.957 --> 01:09:50.665
Where are you going?

01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.537
Sir?

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:13.369
Sir!

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:20.030
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Excuse me for interrupting.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:26.075
- So do it.
- I need your help.

01:10:26.292 --> 01:10:28.874
What is it about?

01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:33.530
- Are you all right?
- Excellently.

01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:39.449
- Where is mrs. Edly?
- She kept me out longer.

01:10:39.625 --> 01:10:41.866
What do you want?

01:10:45.917 --> 01:10:49.205
It is about the book ...

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:53.789
- It is strange and gives no </ i> answers.
- Just like life.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:58.910
I have problems with some girls.

01:11:00.792 --> 01:11:03.579
I do not know what to do.

01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:13.656
You need to get some advice about women from a
man whose wife just left him.

01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:18.873
Honesty, sincerity, honesty ...
Avoid it at all costs.

01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:24.783
Lie as often as you can.
If you are lucky, so will you.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:30.165
If you do not make it,
you can always mad-

01:11:30.333 --> 01:11:33.291
- And develop a drinking problem.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:05.665
 It's worse than expected. </ i>
 I look like complete a sheep! </ i>

01:12:32.083 --> 01:12:36.122
 We've got a new family </ i>
 - Blacky. </ i>

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:40.030
- Who is going to feed it?!
- Me.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:44.118
And I give it just what I want!

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:55.540
 Innocence is in trouble again. </ i>
 father took her from selling booze. </ i>

01:12:57.667 --> 01:13:02.707
 But when he discovered that he </ i>
 could earn 50 cents per bottle </ i>

01:13:02.708 --> 01:13:06.530
 - he decided </ i>
 that he, after all, like black. </ i>

01:13:07.792 --> 01:13:10.704
 mermaid come to visit. </ i>

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:15.990
 Her breasts have grown. </ i>
 They are huge! </ i>

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.540
You have a good pair of melons.
Use them wisely.

01:13:42.542 --> 01:13:46.956
 We went for a walk in the park </ i>
 and she touched me with her breasts. </ i>

01:13:47.125 --> 01:13:49.537
 My dick felt weird. </ i>

01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:55.989
- What is it?
- A mood ring.

01:13:56.208 --> 01:14:01.657
Do you think we get married and have children
and things like that together?

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.572
 Girls! The sure path to madness. </ I>

01:14:16.792 --> 01:14:21.331
 Therefore, Blacky with father </ i>
 vet and have removed the buns. </ i>

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:27.287
 Like me </ i>
 - either boy or man. </ i>

01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:32.076
 last semester and life sailing. </ i>

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:39.452
 - The boss is not the same. </ i>
 - Not now, Milton. </ i>

01:14:42.625 --> 01:14:45.867
 Eva has made it over with Rambo. </ i>

01:14:50.458 --> 01:14:54.121
 Rain Man is Pike's new punching bag. </ i>

01:14:55.833 --> 01:15:00.247
 Gekko discovered that Christine had </ i>
 lavished with Smith, Greg Anderson </ i>

01:15:00.458 --> 01:15:04.155
 - Scott Emberton </ i>
 and half of the rugby team. </ i>

01:15:07.292 --> 01:15:09.499
Hey.

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:15.784
I'm sorry about Christine ... </ i>

01:15:15.958 --> 01:15:19.621
Someone said that she and
with the gramset on you.

01:15:24.125 --> 01:15:28.539
Shall we go up the hill and see
how many snakes we can find?

01:16:14.542 --> 01:16:18.205
Look what I bought in Mozambique.

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:28.117
I bought this for you.

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:33.407
It is abelort.
It is crazy rare.

01:16:33.625 --> 01:16:36.537
Thank you, Gekko.

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.411
Gekko?

01:17:06.375 --> 01:17:10.414
- Is he okay?
- We must have him over to the doctor.

01:17:20.917 --> 01:17:24.489
Good God ... Get him in here, quick!

01:17:36.917 --> 01:17:42.457
- Where is Gekko?
- We had to drive him to the hospital.

01:17:44.833 --> 01:17:48.530
- Is he okay?
- He has malaria.

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:52.698
 It's very serious. </ i>

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.366
I'm scared.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:27.245
What are you talking about?
You'll be back in a week.

01:18:27.417 --> 01:18:32.241
In addition, planning Rambo
a new swimming.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:36.622
You do not always have to do
as Rambo says.

01:18:36.833 --> 01:18:40.781
That does not mean everything in the world
to impress him.

01:18:45.292 --> 01:18:48.739
Can not you sing something for me?

01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:04.745
Sir, I just want to talk with you
on our task: </ i>

01:20:04.958 --> 01:20:08.030
Another time, Milton.

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:14.325
I just wanted to say that Dickens ...

01:20:18.458 --> 01:20:24.658
... Is a boring old fart,
which is unable to write.

01:20:24.875 --> 01:20:29.244
His books can not even
used as toilet paper.

01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:34.790
Listen right here! It is one of the finest
works from the Victorian era.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.117
There was obviously
not much of the time.

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:44.158
Be careful, or I'll force you to
read Enid Blyton high public!

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:59.995
I have been a terrible
stiff sticks, have not I?

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:08.246
Women! You can not live with them, and
you can not send them to Zimbabwe.

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:13.787
Lunch.

01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:28.915
- Why drink you?
- It keeps the wolves away.

01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:33.122
I just get upset,
when I drink.

01:21:33.333 --> 01:21:38.202
The more you drink, the more sad
you become. So you drink even more.

01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:43.328
- It is a paradox.
- You're right in.

01:21:47.208 --> 01:21:52.328
- Shoe polish. Eat, and you get a tier.
- Come on, Fatty!

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:56.288
- Never.
- Do not be a chicken.

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.833
Spud, imitate an animal.

01:22:13.125 --> 01:22:19.200
- I do not want to.
- "I do not want to."

01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:33.450
Stop it!

01:23:46.542 --> 01:23:49.989
Milton! Come with me.

01:24:19.167 --> 01:24:25.037
Gekko has passed away.
He died half an hour ago.

01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:34.032
Doctors fought,
but he was too ill.

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:06.657
Andrews?

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:08.698
Ascott?

01:25:08.917 --> 01:25:10.657
Bains?

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:12.661
Barker?

01:25:14.792 --> 01:25:16.908
Barker?

01:25:17.125 --> 01:25:19.958
Gekko?

01:25:59.833 --> 01:26:02.791
Death, be not proud.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:26.245
You'll get over it eventually.

01:26:33.250 --> 01:26:36.868
And it makes you stronger.

01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:40.954
With time.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.287
In the meantime ...

01:26:47.333 --> 01:26:49.915
Keep reading.

01:26:54.833 --> 01:26:57.870
A book never die from one.

01:28:14.875 --> 01:28:20.040
PREMIERE

01:29:11.583 --> 01:29:16.953
 For all the new </ i>
 and the opportunities it brings. </ i>

01:29:47.708 --> 01:29:50.666
 Milton, are you there? </ i>

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:03.665
May I?

01:30:15.625 --> 01:30:17.616
I will </ i> have to go.

01:30:25.542 --> 01:30:27.783
That's my boy!

01:30:28.875 --> 01:30:31.537
Where is the wig?

01:33:59.625 --> 01:34:02.537
Bravo!

01:34:18.917 --> 01:34:23.957
That's my boy! An Oscar winner!

01:34:24.167 --> 01:34:28.581
- Who were you?
- Oliver.

01:34:32.417 --> 01:34:38.287
- Johnny, you were fantastic!
- You look beautiful.

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:52.871
- What is it?
- Nothing.

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:59.329
We gotta go. I promised Marge,
that Debbie would be home before nine.

01:34:59.542 --> 01:35:03.706
- When I see you again?
- Soon.

01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:08.208
It was beautiful!

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:17.496
Who was it?

01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:21.573
No. Just an ex-boyfriend.

01:35:21.792 --> 01:35:25.159
She still likes you.

01:35:28.417 --> 01:35:32.365
You were pretty good.

01:35:32.583 --> 01:35:34.995
Really?

01:35:37.375 --> 01:35:40.697
We slip.

01:35:49.542 --> 01:35:52.955
Kiss me, sir Spud.

01:35:54.708 --> 01:35:57.700
But what about what you said?

01:36:03.458 --> 01:36:06.370
It does not matter.

01:36:08.083 --> 01:36:10.369
Wait!

01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:18.665
I can not.

01:36:24.917 --> 01:36:27.454
I'm sorry ...

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.958
What is it, Johnny?

01:36:48.333 --> 01:36:52.121
Should I not show you
around the school?

01:36:52.333 --> 01:36:55.291
We gotta go.

01:36:56.292 --> 01:36:59.580
I think we can
be late tonight.

01:37:31.792 --> 01:37:34.158
Come here!

01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:04.745
He's back!

01:38:06.333 --> 01:38:08.995
Well done!

01:38:10.875 --> 01:38:15.790
The slut was hot!

01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:19.121
She was hot!

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:33.243
You know what I </ i> think?

01:38:33.417 --> 01:38:35.908
A swim!

01:39:12.125 --> 01:39:15.538
CLOSURE

01:40:05.125 --> 01:40:09.539
I'd been kept me away from the hill, </ i>
 since Gekko dead. </ i>

01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:13.322
 last chance to </ i>
 take a look at the valley. </ i>

01:40:13.542 --> 01:40:17.114
 An opportunity to see and remember. </ i>

01:40:19.083 --> 01:40:26.159
I had forgotten how beautiful it is here.
</ i> Everything is so vibrant and colorful. </ i>

01:40:28.042 --> 01:40:30.579
 I can see the manager's house. </ i>

01:40:30.792 --> 01:40:35.991
 I remember that he said that </ i>
 God's greatest gift is freedom of choice. </ i>

01:40:38.208 --> 01:40:44.955
 But in some cases </ i>
 God gives us no choice. </ i>

01:40:45.167 --> 01:40:49.115
 He shares the cards out, </ i>
 and we play the hand. </ i>
