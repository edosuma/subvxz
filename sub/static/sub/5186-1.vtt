00:36.451 --> 00:40.148
<i>Imagine an end to crime...</i>

00:40.889 --> 00:43.050
<i>...an end to poverty.</i>

00:43.458 --> 00:48.794
<i>Imagine 2 million good jobs
waiting to be filled.</i>

00:49.197 --> 00:52.030
<i>Sounds like a dream, doesn't it?</i>

00:52.834 --> 00:57.237
<i>Well, sometimes dreams come true.</i>

00:57.472 --> 00:59.167
<i>Delta City.</i>

00:59.541 --> 01:01.475
<i>For our children.</i>

01:08.416 --> 01:12.318
<i>This is Media Break. You give us
three minutes, we'll give you the world.</i>

01:12.921 --> 01:15.913
<i>Good evening, I'm Casey Wong.
Our top story tonight:</i>

01:16.091 --> 01:20.084
<i>Motor City goes Japanese as the
Omni Consumer Products Corporation...</i>

01:20.262 --> 01:23.857
<i>...ended months of speculation today
by announcing its takeover...</i>

01:24.065 --> 01:27.330
<i>...by the multinational
Kanemitsu Corporation.</i>

01:27.502 --> 01:31.563
Come on, honey, hurry up with your
calculus. It's almost time for bed.

01:32.507 --> 01:34.566
I'm watching Media Break.

01:34.876 --> 01:38.368
<i>- the first private corporation
to completely own and operate a major city.</i>

01:38.546 --> 01:40.946
<i>Company spokesmen
express special interest...</i>

01:41.082 --> 01:43.175
<i>...in the issues of urban resettlement...</i>

01:43.351 --> 01:48.448
<i>...and a crime wave in Detroit that
many citizens are calling a war zone.</i>

01:52.027 --> 01:54.222
<i>But as usual, OCP has an answer.</i>

01:54.963 --> 01:58.524
<i>Meet the Rehabs, Urban
rehabilitation officers.</i>

01:58.867 --> 02:01.028
<i>From the blazing fields
of the Amazon War...</i>

02:01.202 --> 02:04.433
<i>...comes state-of-the-art
urban pacification.</i>

02:04.773 --> 02:09.472
<i>We're here to help the people, augment the
police force and deal with the gang problem.</i>

02:09.811 --> 02:12.302
<i>What about reports you're
actually evicting people...</i>

02:12.514 --> 02:15.142
<i>...to make way for
construction of Delta City?</i>

02:15.517 --> 02:18.008
Nikko, you heard your mom.
Go on.

02:18.987 --> 02:20.545
Oh, man.

02:23.325 --> 02:25.020
<i>- And the homeless?
- What a gyp.</i>

02:25.226 --> 02:28.855
<i>Some buildings have to come down
before Delta can go up.</i>

02:29.264 --> 02:32.165
<i>I won't deny we're serving
an eviction notice or two...</i>

02:32.334 --> 02:37.169
<i>...but most of these people have already
taken their urine tests and placement exams.</i>

02:37.339 --> 02:40.035
<i>They've got new jobs waiting for them.</i>

02:40.241 --> 02:43.142
<i>We're just helping them
make the transition, that's all.</i>

02:43.578 --> 02:47.446
<i>- We're cops, nothing more.
- Nothing more?</i>

02:47.849 --> 02:50.340
<i>Well, we're not robots,
if that's what you mean.</i>

03:17.112 --> 03:18.409
Hey, Dad?

03:23.885 --> 03:25.580
You're supposed to be asleep.

03:26.021 --> 03:29.957
Is it true what the Tv said?

03:30.492 --> 03:32.357
That it's a war zone outside?

03:32.594 --> 03:36.826
Don't listen to what the Tv says.
This is your home, you hear me?

03:36.998 --> 03:38.829
And you're safe here.

03:46.041 --> 03:49.135
<i>I'll buy that for a dollar!</i>

03:49.978 --> 03:52.572
Get out, get out, get out!

04:00.155 --> 04:03.454
This neighborhood is the
property of omni Consumer Products.

04:30.452 --> 04:34.388
- For God's sake, help us!
- That's what we're here for, ma'am.

04:38.193 --> 04:40.252
Just get on the bus.

04:40.862 --> 04:44.059
Where are they taking us, Dad?
What's happening?

04:45.500 --> 04:50.301
Don't believe them! They'll throw us
into the streets to die like rats!

04:50.472 --> 04:53.202
Nazi sons of bitches!

04:58.113 --> 05:00.343
Shoot her if you must,
but get her out of here.

05:00.515 --> 05:01.982
Yes, sir.

05:02.784 --> 05:05.184
Let's go. Come on.

05:05.386 --> 05:08.116
I think it's going rather well,
don't you?

05:08.323 --> 05:09.483
Yes, sir.

05:09.924 --> 05:12.552
Come on, I said, move! Move!

05:12.894 --> 05:16.352
- Manandle an old lady, would you?
- Shut up!

05:18.867 --> 05:20.562
- Move, move!
- Get up there!

05:20.969 --> 05:22.869
I said, get up!

05:23.938 --> 05:27.772
What are you doing down there?
Piece of slime!

05:28.376 --> 05:29.968
Can you hear me?

05:31.246 --> 05:33.806
I said, get up, you drunken cow!

05:37.018 --> 05:39.953
Get back! The crane's gonna blow!

05:51.466 --> 05:54.765
Listen to me, people!
These buses are going nowhere!

05:55.270 --> 05:59.969
Stay here! Fight for your homes!
There is no silver lining!

06:00.141 --> 06:04.908
Only corporate scumbags
who want to line their pockets!

06:11.953 --> 06:14.114
Nikko! Nikko!

06:14.289 --> 06:18.191
Mom! Mom! Dad!

06:18.560 --> 06:23.998
Nikko! No! That's my baby!
Nikko, Nikko!

06:26.034 --> 06:29.800
Mom! Dad! Dad!

06:30.038 --> 06:31.801
Mom, Dad!

06:36.311 --> 06:38.176
Mom!

06:50.124 --> 06:52.058
Mom!

06:52.994 --> 06:54.393
Dad?!

06:56.898 --> 06:58.798
Mom!

07:10.445 --> 07:13.005
You! Stay where you are!

07:35.236 --> 07:39.866
<i>Repeat: The rehabilitation
officers are here to assist you.</i>

07:47.815 --> 07:51.478
It's okay, it's okay.
You're with us now.

07:52.387 --> 07:53.376
Is he gone?

07:54.389 --> 07:56.118
Are we clear?

07:56.291 --> 07:57.349
Clear!

07:58.426 --> 08:00.417
Okay, let's do it.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.229
Okay, Moreno.

08:13.408 --> 08:14.397
<i>Cover your ears.</i>

08:18.079 --> 08:19.478
Rock 'r roll.

08:31.059 --> 08:33.027
<i>All clear. Let's go.</i>

08:47.442 --> 08:49.000
Jesus!

08:51.112 --> 08:53.580
- ED 209!
- He wasrt in the recon photo!

08:56.584 --> 09:00.247
Freeze! You are trespassing
on police property.

09:00.421 --> 09:02.013
Please surrender your weapons.

09:02.223 --> 09:04.054
- What the hell?
- Is she crazy?

09:04.225 --> 09:06.090
You have 20 seconds to comply.

09:06.294 --> 09:09.957
- Hey, kid, come back here!
- You're gonna get us all killed!

09:11.099 --> 09:13.090
What the hell is she doing?

09:13.267 --> 09:17.363
You are in direct violation
of penal code 114, section 3.

09:17.538 --> 09:20.837
I am authorized to use physical force.

09:21.042 --> 09:24.011
You now have 10 seconds to comply.

09:25.079 --> 09:28.446
You won't believe this.
He'll be loyal as a puppy.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.944
You have five seconds.
Four seconds.

09:32.520 --> 09:36.786
Three seconds.
You have one second to comply.

09:36.958 --> 09:39.358
I am now authorized to...

09:40.361 --> 09:42.886
...be loyal as a puppy.

09:43.331 --> 09:44.457
Damn!

09:53.141 --> 09:54.130
Will it work?

09:55.410 --> 09:57.310
Stole it off a dead cop.

10:04.819 --> 10:06.946
Holy shit! That's the police armory!

10:10.158 --> 10:13.423
- They deleted the access signature.
- Let's get out of here!

10:13.928 --> 10:17.227
They'll be a few minutes. Let's
figure out how to open that door!

10:17.398 --> 10:18.558
Are you kidding me?

11:00.942 --> 11:02.773
One-stop shopping.

11:09.283 --> 11:12.081
- Let's go! Gotta get out of here!
- He's right. Let's ride.

11:15.890 --> 11:18.916
- What are you, picking out drapes?
- Coming!

11:24.298 --> 11:25.890
- Get that.
- Why?

11:26.100 --> 11:28.159
It looks expensive.

11:34.542 --> 11:36.476
Come on! Come on, let's go!

11:42.517 --> 11:43.882
Drop your weapons now!

11:44.285 --> 11:45.980
Do it! Drop them!

11:52.426 --> 11:55.554
Freeze! You're trespassing
on police property.

11:57.064 --> 11:58.827
Eat lead, suckers!

12:09.310 --> 12:11.141
Nikko, get in! Come on!

12:49.550 --> 12:50.847
What can I do for you?

12:53.020 --> 12:54.851
Nobody move!

12:55.022 --> 12:57.286
Everything in the register!
Now! Do it!

13:06.167 --> 13:09.000
What's it like
being a rocket scientist?

13:09.170 --> 13:13.800
<i>All units, we have a B and E involving
police property, please respond.</i>

13:13.975 --> 13:16.307
<i>Repeat, all units, we have a...</i>

13:16.510 --> 13:19.377
Hey, Donnelly, it's your turn.

13:19.580 --> 13:23.414
- No way. We went last time.
- No, it's Lewis' turn.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.344
Lewis, you're up.

13:29.090 --> 13:32.150
Lewis! Lewis! Lewis!

13:33.861 --> 13:36.853
Isn't anybody gonna arrest me,
or what?!

13:37.231 --> 13:40.291
- Where's your friend Murphy?
- He's not big on doughnuts.

13:40.468 --> 13:42.527
- He's not big on doughnuts.
- I knew that.

13:42.937 --> 13:46.429
<i>All units, repeat,
that is a battered yellow van.</i>

13:46.807 --> 13:49.207
<i>No plates.
Tracking shows southbound...</i>

13:50.077 --> 13:53.274
- That's a battered yellow van.
- No shit, Sherlock.

14:04.392 --> 14:06.326
Moreno, company's coming!

14:10.264 --> 14:11.788
Hold on. Here we go.

14:18.372 --> 14:22.172
Unit 477 in pursuit,
eastbound, Esposito.

14:31.452 --> 14:32.476
Watch it!

14:32.820 --> 14:34.185
I'm watching it!

14:57.111 --> 14:58.100
Jesus!

15:12.960 --> 15:14.427
They're still on our tail.

15:14.929 --> 15:16.453
Don't sweat it.

15:16.797 --> 15:18.765
Hey, kid. Watch this.

16:00.107 --> 16:01.972
Hold the champagne.

16:12.386 --> 16:14.377
You stopped in the middle
of the street!

16:14.555 --> 16:17.183
- That was my light!
- You idiot!

16:17.358 --> 16:20.384
- Is everybody okay?
- Okay? What are you, a comedian?

16:20.594 --> 16:23.961
I traded in a brand new SUX
for this classic. Now look at it!

16:24.131 --> 16:26.565
It's garbage. It's going to the junkyard.

16:26.934 --> 16:31.962
What is this, fellas? You give a broad
a badge and she gets delusions of gander.

16:32.139 --> 16:34.869
It's "grandeur," dumbshit.

16:38.445 --> 16:41.141
This new guy is making me nervous.

16:42.049 --> 16:44.313
I don't think this is exactly a guy.

16:44.485 --> 16:46.146
You think it's him?

16:52.059 --> 16:53.822
Unit 477 to dispatch.

16:53.994 --> 16:57.225
This is 477 to dispatch.
Come in, dispatch.

16:57.398 --> 16:59.298
We could use some backup out here.

16:59.466 --> 17:03.334
Hello, dispatch. Come in.
This is 477 to dispatch.

17:04.204 --> 17:05.297
Lewis.

17:11.145 --> 17:12.544
Splatterpunks.

17:15.015 --> 17:18.246
Wait a second, what do you need
the shotgun for?

17:18.419 --> 17:20.353
Shit, we're all gonna die.

17:20.554 --> 17:23.250
- Sit tight, people. Backup's coming.
- Sit tight?

17:23.424 --> 17:27.952
If it wasrt for you, I wouldn't
even be here, you dumb broad.

17:28.127 --> 17:32.292
I'll make you a deal, tough guy.
You want to eat the tie, keep it up.

17:32.499 --> 17:35.059
Take it easy. My brother's a cop.

18:17.811 --> 18:22.544
<i>477 to dispatch, code 3! We're low
on ammo and need immediate backup!</i>

18:22.850 --> 18:23.839
<i>Right now!</i>

18:33.594 --> 18:34.925
Sergeant Reed.

18:35.429 --> 18:37.363
I got Murphy's cruiser on the grid.

18:37.564 --> 18:39.964
- He just turned around.
- He what?!

19:03.457 --> 19:05.425
Murphy, this is Reed.

19:05.592 --> 19:08.493
I have three other vehicles
en route to Lewis.

19:09.129 --> 19:14.192
Murphy, continue pursuit! That is a
direct order! Do I make myself clear?

19:14.368 --> 19:15.960
<i>Murphy, are you listen...?</i>

20:25.272 --> 20:28.036
Police officer. No loitering.

20:44.425 --> 20:45.824
You called for backup?

20:51.165 --> 20:53.497
Thanks for dropping by, Murphy.

20:54.334 --> 20:56.063
Are they gone?

20:56.837 --> 20:58.896
I'm still scanning three.

21:07.114 --> 21:09.173
Make that two.

21:15.456 --> 21:17.856
Block it! Megazone invasion!

21:18.025 --> 21:21.324
Pop a tranq, hypo-head.
Splatterville's ours.

21:22.062 --> 21:23.927
Shoot him in the mouth.

21:24.164 --> 21:25.995
Cyborg eats bullets, Jock.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.064
Not tonight he don't.

22:19.486 --> 22:20.851
Hit him in the mouth!

22:21.054 --> 22:22.954
- Shut up!
- Do it! Do it!

22:23.090 --> 22:25.081
- Do it! Do it!
- Shut up!

22:29.997 --> 22:31.760
Nice try, creeps.

22:31.932 --> 22:32.921
Give me it!

22:34.368 --> 22:36.802
You have the right to remain silent.

22:46.146 --> 22:47.579
Down there.

22:53.787 --> 22:55.516
Jesus, Murphy, are you okay?

22:55.856 --> 22:57.551
I'm fine, Anne.

22:57.891 --> 22:59.324
Thank you for asking.

23:01.361 --> 23:02.953
Come on, come on!

23:18.478 --> 23:21.447
Let's go! Everything
will be all right.

23:24.785 --> 23:26.275
Get your damn hands off me!

23:31.491 --> 23:32.890
Stupid kid.

23:43.103 --> 23:46.334
- Come here. Come on.
- Would you forget the stupid kid already?!

24:27.347 --> 24:29.247
Kanemitsu-san...

24:29.416 --> 24:32.044
...I realize we've had setbacks...

24:32.219 --> 24:37.179
...but we've done everything possible
to get Delta City back on schedule.

24:50.937 --> 24:52.063
Gentlemen...

24:54.374 --> 24:57.309
...you are now looking at a company...

24:57.477 --> 24:58.967
...in transition.

24:59.846 --> 25:04.249
Needless to say, this has resulted in
the implementation of certain...

25:04.418 --> 25:05.851
...well...

25:06.019 --> 25:07.486
...let's call them...

25:08.221 --> 25:09.950
..."cutbacks."

25:10.123 --> 25:13.183
But who can put a price tag
on a dream?

25:14.961 --> 25:18.089
Our esteemed former chairman
had a dream.

25:18.265 --> 25:20.028
He called it Delta City.

25:21.101 --> 25:22.568
Knock it off, Johnson.

25:26.206 --> 25:30.575
The great city of Detroit represents
an important precedent, gentlemen.

25:31.144 --> 25:33.772
There's only one small problem.

25:34.214 --> 25:36.478
It's turning into a war zone!

25:36.850 --> 25:38.477
It's just a small resistance group.

25:38.819 --> 25:41.811
There's no reason to believe they
pose a significant threat.

25:42.055 --> 25:43.522
I'd consider...

25:43.857 --> 25:48.055
...a deficit of 350 million dollars
a significant threat.

25:48.261 --> 25:49.785
Wouldrt you?

25:51.465 --> 25:53.228
- Fleck!
- Sir.

25:53.367 --> 25:55.494
You're in charge of Security Concepts.

25:55.802 --> 25:58.828
Where's that Robocop
we spent so much money on?

25:59.005 --> 26:02.941
The police had a problem
with the unit. I'm dealing with it personally.

26:03.110 --> 26:04.509
You do that.

26:05.112 --> 26:06.773
Get him to the Rehab Team...

26:06.980 --> 26:11.440
...and maybe we won't have to worry
about a "small resistance group."

26:11.785 --> 26:14.015
Get the hell out of here, all of you!

26:14.187 --> 26:15.449
You take your time.

26:15.789 --> 26:17.950
And for God's sake, Fleck...

26:18.125 --> 26:21.026
...try to get the police on our side.

26:26.133 --> 26:29.125
What if I don't want
a robot on my team?

26:30.570 --> 26:33.198
You've got 4 days, McDaggett.

26:33.774 --> 26:37.266
If Cadillac Heights isn't cleared
for demolition Friday midnight...

26:37.477 --> 26:41.470
...our loans will be called in.
OCP will be ruined.

26:41.848 --> 26:43.577
We made a deal, didn't we, chum.

26:44.584 --> 26:46.882
Oh, by the way...

26:47.888 --> 26:52.552
...if you're just figuring out the
line between big business and war...

26:52.893 --> 26:55.054
...is a little blurry...

26:55.262 --> 26:58.026
...then you're further over the hill
than they say.

27:51.051 --> 27:54.851
This is entrapment! My client was
visiting close friends in that motel.

27:55.021 --> 27:58.115
Hey, buddy. Your client's friends...

27:58.291 --> 28:01.351
...were a non-union video crew
and a German shepherd.

28:01.561 --> 28:02.960
That's prejudicial.

28:03.129 --> 28:06.895
Did the arresting officer
ask to see their union cards?

28:07.100 --> 28:10.467
Come get this crap.
Will someone answer the damn phone?!

28:10.837 --> 28:14.796
Metro West. No, ma'am,
we're not on strike.

28:14.975 --> 28:18.433
You could have fooled me.
I'll deal with those looters myself.

28:18.778 --> 28:21.474
Get me a baseball bat
with some nails in it.

28:30.223 --> 28:31.850
How are you feeling?

28:33.393 --> 28:35.020
I've been better.

28:35.996 --> 28:40.126
To be honest, it looks like you just
made friends with a Mack truck.

28:42.102 --> 28:43.831
I don't have many...

28:43.970 --> 28:45.028
...friends.

28:56.216 --> 28:57.205
Dr. Lazarus.

28:59.185 --> 29:04.145
- You want to tell me what happened?
- Atlanta beat the Pistons last night.

29:04.324 --> 29:08.317
- That's cute. I meant with glory boy.
- Oh, him.

29:09.062 --> 29:11.963
He got shot to hell and set on fire.

29:12.132 --> 29:15.761
You know what I'm talking about.
He disobeyed a direct order. Why?

29:15.936 --> 29:19.497
- My real opinion?
- No, lie. Make up a story.

29:20.774 --> 29:22.401
Well, Mr. Fleck...

29:24.010 --> 29:25.307
...offhand...

29:25.478 --> 29:29.414
...l'd say the only reason
he'd disobey an order is if...

29:29.583 --> 29:31.414
...he didn't agree with it.

29:33.820 --> 29:34.809
Excuse me?

29:36.122 --> 29:38.022
He made a decision.

29:38.325 --> 29:42.261
His friend was in trouble, he made
a judgment call. Cops do that.

29:42.429 --> 29:45.489
Human cops. What do you mean,
"his friend"? It's a machine.

29:45.799 --> 29:50.065
Look, if oCP just wanted a robot, why'd
they put Murphy in there in the first place?

29:50.203 --> 29:52.501
Murphy's dead, sweetheart,
that's on record.

29:52.839 --> 29:55.307
Mr. Fleck, this is Murphy!

29:55.475 --> 29:58.171
What's left of his face,
his cerebrum, his cerebellum.

29:58.345 --> 30:00.575
Human tissue that's still alive.

30:00.914 --> 30:02.973
How can you interface human
and machine...

30:03.149 --> 30:05.845
...then complain
when the human part makes a decision?

30:08.989 --> 30:12.481
So not only did we get Murphy's
years of training...

30:12.792 --> 30:16.319
...and his law-enforcement skills,
we also inerited...

30:16.496 --> 30:20.398
...his memories, his feelings,
his emotional baggage?

30:20.767 --> 30:26.000
Well, I'd call it his humanity,
but I don't think you know that word.

30:27.007 --> 30:28.167
I see.

30:29.976 --> 30:33.070
You talked me into it.
His emotions: Get rid of them.

30:34.347 --> 30:38.477
Find their location and erase them.
If it wipes out his memory, too bad.

30:40.920 --> 30:44.083
We could cut out
the appropriate circuits by...

30:45.058 --> 30:48.391
...implanting a micro-neuro-barrier.

30:54.300 --> 30:55.858
Do it.

30:57.137 --> 31:00.106
I got news for you.
I don't give a shit how smart you are.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.267
OCP owns the cops. That means they
own him, and they own your cute little ass.

31:04.944 --> 31:06.809
Nobody owns me.

31:07.414 --> 31:08.779
Fine.

31:09.015 --> 31:12.781
We want him on the Rehab Team.

31:13.053 --> 31:16.955
That means you make him predictable,
or look for a new job, sweet cheeks.

31:23.863 --> 31:25.455
I think I'm in love.

31:40.947 --> 31:43.211
What's going through your head?

32:00.533 --> 32:01.932
That's his family.

32:02.769 --> 32:05.397
Want me to install
the neuro-barrier, doctor?

32:05.772 --> 32:07.569
No, I can do it.

32:14.881 --> 32:17.782
I think I'd like to be alone with him,
if it's all right.

32:46.579 --> 32:49.571
<i>Alex, I thought
you'd never get home.</i>

32:55.054 --> 32:59.286
Don't let the fact that these people
are homeless sway you.

33:00.927 --> 33:03.521
They're terrorists, pure and simple.

33:04.864 --> 33:08.891
On the screens
are suspected rebel locations.

33:09.102 --> 33:13.095
If these locations appear
on your regular beat, check it out.

33:13.273 --> 33:17.334
Make sure you report
any unusual findings...

33:19.479 --> 33:21.106
Hear what they did to Murphy?

34:07.093 --> 34:08.355
Murphy.

34:31.451 --> 34:33.510
Lewis, you want your body armor?

34:33.887 --> 34:36.514
What? No, I'm off duty.

34:39.492 --> 34:41.221
What's up, anyway?

34:42.027 --> 34:43.188
Do you have family?

34:44.030 --> 34:48.262
Yeah, I have a brother in Pittsburgh,
the one who never calls. You know that.

34:50.036 --> 34:51.799
Robo, are you okay?

34:52.105 --> 34:53.538
I'm fine.

34:55.141 --> 34:56.802
And call me Murphy.

36:02.475 --> 36:03.965
Murphy?

36:09.482 --> 36:11.416
<i>Step out of the building.</i>

36:33.072 --> 36:35.165
Stay right there.

36:35.575 --> 36:37.475
We're police officers.

36:37.810 --> 36:38.936
We don't want you.

36:39.145 --> 36:42.876
We believe there are squatters in there.
Now step away from the door.

36:43.049 --> 36:46.143
They're civilians.
They're just trying to stay warm!

36:46.352 --> 36:49.412
Those people belong
in the nearest rehabilitation center.

36:52.825 --> 36:57.558
Some are terrorists. Step away or you
will be cited for obstructing justice.

37:02.769 --> 37:04.999
I'm not going to ask politely next time.

37:05.171 --> 37:06.570
Step away from the door.

37:10.109 --> 37:12.441
This is your final warning.

37:25.792 --> 37:28.192
You are making a mistake.

37:31.864 --> 37:35.891
- Back off, or there'll be trouble.
- Now you're talking, Murphy.

37:36.102 --> 37:39.936
We're not budging. If you wanna get in,
you'll have to shoot through us.

37:41.441 --> 37:44.239
I don't have a huge problem with that.

38:12.105 --> 38:13.197
Cease fire!

38:27.887 --> 38:29.184
Robocop.

38:35.094 --> 38:37.153
Come on, come on, come on!

38:42.835 --> 38:43.961
Come with us!

38:45.571 --> 38:46.868
Cover me.

39:26.045 --> 39:29.446
Some tough cop I am. Huh, partner?

39:34.921 --> 39:37.185
I'm scared.

39:38.524 --> 39:40.082
Don't be.

39:40.259 --> 39:42.250
It won't hurt long.

39:44.564 --> 39:46.429
Get them for me.

39:47.433 --> 39:48.991
Promise me.

39:49.168 --> 39:51.466
I promise.

39:54.473 --> 39:56.065
Murphy.

40:05.952 --> 40:07.783
Officer down.

40:17.763 --> 40:18.957
Move it!

40:19.098 --> 40:21.532
We don't have much time.

40:22.235 --> 40:23.293
Nikko, let's go.

40:23.469 --> 40:25.937
Come on. Come with us.

40:26.405 --> 40:28.771
Is she crazy?
He's a cop! He's one of them!

40:30.042 --> 40:31.873
He's on our side now.

40:32.044 --> 40:34.103
She's right. You saw what he did.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.771
You'll let a stupid kid
make our decisions?

40:36.949 --> 40:40.441
- We're at war. We can use his help.
- Are you kidding me? Look at him!

40:40.786 --> 40:42.276
He is totaled, man!

40:42.455 --> 40:45.015
People, come on.
We don't have time for this shit.

40:48.294 --> 40:49.261
He's right.

40:50.963 --> 40:52.089
We should go.

41:08.214 --> 41:11.012
Five-meter spread.
Search the perimeter.

41:13.519 --> 41:14.577
Damn.

41:14.920 --> 41:19.220
- We're tracking him, sir. He's moving.
- Impossible. The building is surrounded.

41:19.959 --> 41:21.927
He's gone underground.

41:22.094 --> 41:23.527
Find a manole.

41:47.553 --> 41:49.521
We got a little held up.

42:00.399 --> 42:02.026
Rats?

42:04.837 --> 42:05.826
One or two.

42:11.777 --> 42:12.573
Go on through.

42:23.089 --> 42:24.317
Are you okay?

42:28.361 --> 42:30.329
I'm fine.

42:32.064 --> 42:33.190
Hey!

42:34.266 --> 42:35.961
You guys!

42:40.239 --> 42:41.900
Oh, man!

42:42.141 --> 42:44.268
I told you it was a mistake to bring him.

42:44.477 --> 42:46.069
I bet he weighs a ton.

42:49.081 --> 42:51.015
Watch your step.

42:51.150 --> 42:52.208
All right.

42:53.486 --> 42:55.147
Clear the way.

42:55.321 --> 42:57.585
- Get out of the way.
- Hold up your side.

43:04.230 --> 43:05.219
He don't look good.

43:05.398 --> 43:09.357
You wouldn't look so good either
if you took a grenade in your chest.

43:09.835 --> 43:11.302
Tracking.

43:12.071 --> 43:13.504
- Beacon.
- Tracking?

43:15.374 --> 43:17.103
He'll lead them right to us!

43:17.309 --> 43:19.072
Shut up, Coontz!

43:19.245 --> 43:20.473
What's he talking about?

43:35.961 --> 43:39.328
- Did he booby-trap the 8th Street entrance?
- Maybe.

44:08.594 --> 44:10.994
Better get mobilized, folks.

44:11.497 --> 44:14.523
They got a little too close
to home that time.

44:15.968 --> 44:17.492
It's not won'th it.

44:17.837 --> 44:19.532
It's not won'th this shit!

44:21.207 --> 44:23.971
You better take
a real deep breath right now, Coontz.

44:24.143 --> 44:26.475
Because if you don't think
it's won'th it...

44:26.812 --> 44:30.248
...then you're nothing but excess baggage.
Do you hear me?!

44:32.284 --> 44:34.479
You get it together, Coontz.

44:34.820 --> 44:38.517
Cadillac Heights may not be much,
but it's our home.

44:38.858 --> 44:40.519
It's all we got.

44:41.193 --> 44:45.493
If you don't think our homes is won'th
it, then tell me what the hell is.

44:52.505 --> 44:55.099
This is Bertha to Base op.
We're coming in.

44:55.307 --> 44:57.275
Set an extra place.

44:57.476 --> 44:59.535
We're bringing in a friend.

45:06.585 --> 45:08.849
<i>Incoming caller.</i>

45:15.094 --> 45:16.061
What do you want?

45:16.762 --> 45:18.354
<i>Nice work, dollface.</i>

45:18.531 --> 45:20.055
What you talking about?

45:20.232 --> 45:22.564
<i>You haven't heard?</i>

45:22.935 --> 45:25.062
<i>You might want to turn on Media Break.</i>

45:26.305 --> 45:28.773
Tv on, channel 378.

45:28.941 --> 45:32.900
<i>Witness to the tragic shooting
was Rehab Commander, Paul McDaggett.</i>

45:34.847 --> 45:39.375
<i>All I can say is it's a terrible loss
of a fine public servant.</i>

45:39.985 --> 45:43.887
<i>It's hard to believe that she was
gunned down by her own partner.</i>

45:44.924 --> 45:46.892
<i>An OCP spokesperson has confirmed...</i>

45:47.026 --> 45:50.154
<i>...that Robocop has joined
the terrorist rebel forces.</i>

45:50.329 --> 45:54.322
<i>He is heavily armed and should be
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

45:54.934 --> 45:56.265
Tv off.

45:56.435 --> 46:00.565
<i>Congratulations, sweet cheeks.
Now listen up. I want your legendary ass...</i>

46:00.906 --> 46:03.306
<i>...and your corporate I.D. Card
in my office...</i>

46:03.442 --> 46:07.469
<i>...by 7:00 a.m. Tomorrow. And maybe
you won't be brought up on charges.</i>

46:07.813 --> 46:11.078
<i>Meantime, you might want to decide
whose side you're on.</i>

46:12.551 --> 46:14.348
<i>Sleep tight.</i>

46:23.362 --> 46:26.991
- He what?
- Shot at Rehabs and went underground.

46:27.166 --> 46:31.227
- There goes our P.R. Budget.
- Company line is he's gone renegade.

46:31.437 --> 46:33.905
- How'd the CEo take it?
- How do you think?

46:34.073 --> 46:37.270
Between me and you,
I think the CEo's losing it.

46:37.443 --> 46:39.809
I mean, take a look around, will you?

46:39.979 --> 46:42.004
It's the Fall of Rome around here.

46:42.181 --> 46:44.877
It's Darwin time,
you know what I'm saying?

46:45.050 --> 46:47.177
Survival of the least expendable.

46:47.353 --> 46:51.312
Remember the old man.
Everyone's expendable.

46:52.891 --> 46:55.860
<i>It can't be that bad.</i>

46:56.061 --> 46:58.029
<i>Honey, can you hear me?</i>

46:58.831 --> 47:00.230
<i>Are you there?</i>

47:01.967 --> 47:05.903
<i>Every corporation
goes through this sort of thing.</i>

47:26.091 --> 47:28.389
Oh, my God, what happened?

47:30.529 --> 47:31.496
What's happening?

47:31.864 --> 47:33.456
Arnott just went out the window.

47:33.799 --> 47:36.529
- That's the fourth one this month.
- Chickenshit.

47:36.902 --> 47:39.370
I'd eat a bullet myself.

47:39.538 --> 47:41.096
Less showy.

47:43.942 --> 47:46.809
The writing was on the wall
the minute we hopped...

47:46.979 --> 47:50.210
...in the sack with that shitty
Kanemitsu corporation.

47:55.788 --> 47:57.016
As I was saying...

47:58.991 --> 48:01.960
...we have a warrant out
for Robocop's arrest.

48:02.127 --> 48:06.791
If we can eliminate him, then we'll
find that the squatters are more...

48:06.965 --> 48:09.798
...let's say, easily persuaded.

48:22.815 --> 48:25.784
Fleck. A word with you, son.

48:25.951 --> 48:28.442
I'm sorry for the intrusion, sir.

48:28.787 --> 48:30.880
Anything Security Concepts can do?

48:31.390 --> 48:35.884
Security Concepts can kiss
my freckled butt. You're fired.

48:37.062 --> 48:40.554
You heard me!
You're fired. Get out of here.

48:49.475 --> 48:51.443
Three days until disaster.

48:51.810 --> 48:54.472
What the hell
will I tell my shareholders?

48:55.514 --> 48:57.311
What about more Rehabs, sir?

48:57.516 --> 49:01.043
We could recruit them
out of the Police Department.

49:01.987 --> 49:04.080
It would be cheaper than mercenaries...

49:04.223 --> 49:07.852
...and we could use the Metro West facility
as a staging area.

49:09.294 --> 49:11.888
Give them a nominal raise
for an incentive.

49:12.064 --> 49:14.089
You're a good man, Johnson.

49:14.266 --> 49:17.099
I knew there was a reason
I made you a vice president.

49:17.269 --> 49:18.327
Thank you, sir.

49:18.504 --> 49:20.472
I really...

50:02.948 --> 50:04.916
Heads up!

50:06.852 --> 50:09.082
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late!

51:01.006 --> 51:02.030
Well?

51:02.207 --> 51:03.435
Can you fix him?

51:05.377 --> 51:07.868
This isn't a valve job on a Chevy.

51:09.081 --> 51:11.879
I never worked
on a damn Robocop before.

51:12.050 --> 51:14.575
- I can do the body work, but...
- Look...

51:14.920 --> 51:17.912
...we gotta hang on to the Heights
for three more days.

51:19.024 --> 51:22.516
- He can hold out till then, can't he?
- Are you listening to me?!

51:24.363 --> 51:27.093
He's messed up.
We don't have the equipment.

51:27.266 --> 51:28.893
Who the hell does?!

51:30.469 --> 51:31.527
Lazarus.

51:36.108 --> 51:39.100
Find doctor...

51:40.545 --> 51:41.773
...Lazarus.

52:16.248 --> 52:18.011
Who are you?

52:18.183 --> 52:20.208
I'm friends with Robocop.

52:23.922 --> 52:26.015
Well, he's not here. I'm sorry.

52:26.358 --> 52:27.791
You don't believe me.

52:34.299 --> 52:37.166
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to believe anymore.

52:37.436 --> 52:39.370
He had a message for you.

52:40.772 --> 52:45.232
He said to thank you for not
taking his memories away.

53:06.298 --> 53:08.562
Well, well, well.

53:09.935 --> 53:12.096
Afraid you're a little late, pal.

53:14.339 --> 53:17.502
You must be one of Kanemitsu's boys.

53:18.110 --> 53:19.475
I'm impressed.

53:20.278 --> 53:21.802
Trouble is...

53:25.050 --> 53:26.244
...your boss...

53:27.853 --> 53:30.117
...he kind of owns oCP.

53:30.288 --> 53:33.382
And oCP's kind of on our shitlist
with a bullet!

54:14.466 --> 54:17.560
So you want to know
where the rebels are?

54:18.570 --> 54:21.903
You can tell your bosses
to kiss my ass!

55:01.847 --> 55:03.781
A vehicle is approaching.

56:00.238 --> 56:01.865
How you doing, Murphy?

56:02.374 --> 56:03.932
I've been better.

56:04.309 --> 56:07.107
- Give me a status scan.
- Organics intact.

56:07.846 --> 56:11.338
Systems efficiency: 23 percent.

56:12.851 --> 56:14.978
Looks like a direct hit to the heart.

56:15.353 --> 56:17.821
We have to recalibrate
the pneumatic system.

56:17.989 --> 56:19.513
Is he gonna die?

56:21.560 --> 56:23.357
Not if I can help it.

56:24.296 --> 56:26.890
Let's get everything hooked up
to the generator.

56:27.399 --> 56:28.889
We've got work to do.

56:32.437 --> 56:33.927
I'm going to unplug you
for a little while.

56:35.307 --> 56:38.003
Don't worry,
everything's gonna be okay.

56:44.149 --> 56:45.275
Here you go.

56:46.885 --> 56:48.819
I got that heart you wanted.

56:49.454 --> 56:51.513
I said a Nissan. That's a Kanemitsu.

56:52.090 --> 56:55.184
Zack, we need that sealant! Zack!

56:55.360 --> 56:57.351
Marie! Marie! Look!

56:57.562 --> 56:59.189
Oh, shit.

57:01.399 --> 57:03.458
Bring me that chest plate over here.

57:07.939 --> 57:10.100
You wait, man.

57:10.308 --> 57:12.799
You are gonna be so cherry.

57:13.478 --> 57:15.537
Moreno, watch out for the...

57:16.314 --> 57:18.077
What the hell are you doing?

57:18.250 --> 57:21.083
I didn't know that thing was there!

57:21.253 --> 57:23.881
- Don't yell at me!
- Well, don't do it.

57:40.438 --> 57:41.496
Murphy.

57:42.040 --> 57:43.302
It's you.

57:50.015 --> 57:52.540
Alex, I thought you'd never get home.

58:21.012 --> 58:22.570
Welcome home, Murphy.

58:50.975 --> 58:51.999
I couldn't sleep.

58:52.410 --> 58:53.809
How are you feeling?

58:54.212 --> 58:56.578
My efficiency rate is 93 percent.

58:58.516 --> 59:00.916
Anything above 90
is considered normal.

59:02.921 --> 59:04.821
I heard Marie call you Murphy.

59:05.924 --> 59:07.289
Is that your real name?

59:08.393 --> 59:09.485
It was...

59:10.395 --> 59:11.521
...before...

59:13.131 --> 59:14.291
Before what?

59:27.512 --> 59:29.104
So...

59:32.283 --> 59:35.912
Now that you're better, will you stay?

59:36.087 --> 59:37.384
Will you help us?

59:38.356 --> 59:42.816
You know what Bertha says. If we hold
back the Rehabs for two more days...

59:42.994 --> 59:44.825
...they can't make us move.

59:44.996 --> 59:49.558
And they'll have to let my parents go.
We'll all be together like family again.

59:51.936 --> 59:53.267
Your parents?

01:00:16.428 --> 01:00:18.794
Murphy? You okay?

01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:22.525
Your parents, you miss them?

01:00:25.937 --> 01:00:27.063
Yeah.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:31.030
But...

01:00:31.576 --> 01:00:32.975
...you remember them.

01:00:35.046 --> 01:00:36.104
Because...

01:00:37.248 --> 01:00:39.113
...if you remember them...

01:00:40.285 --> 01:00:41.980
...they're never really gone.

01:01:03.575 --> 01:01:05.065
Hey, Murphy...

01:01:06.444 --> 01:01:09.072
...l'm glad your new heart works.

01:01:15.553 --> 01:01:16.542
I heard voices.

01:01:22.794 --> 01:01:24.352
She should be in bed.

01:01:29.534 --> 01:01:31.092
Could you leave her...

01:01:32.170 --> 01:01:33.501
...just a moment?

01:01:37.942 --> 01:01:38.931
Of course.

01:02:05.503 --> 01:02:07.403
You gotta pay for that.

01:02:14.879 --> 01:02:16.437
What are you, deaf?

01:02:16.781 --> 01:02:17.873
Son of a...

01:02:38.469 --> 01:02:40.198
That's not what we said.

01:02:40.371 --> 01:02:43.204
It's not what we said
we were gonna do!

01:02:43.374 --> 01:02:45.774
Bertha, you said
to relocate the weapons...

01:02:45.944 --> 01:02:48.174
...but where do you want this thing?

01:02:50.148 --> 01:02:52.048
Oh, my God.

01:02:53.918 --> 01:02:55.442
How did you get this?

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.454
We stole it from the police depot. Why?

01:02:58.790 --> 01:03:01.554
This looks like the exhaust
system from an F-27.

01:03:01.893 --> 01:03:04.259
No. It's the prototype
for Robo's flight pack.

01:03:04.429 --> 01:03:07.956
The funding ran out
before we got a chance to test it.

01:03:08.099 --> 01:03:11.296
- How do you know so much about it?
- I designed it.

01:03:13.938 --> 01:03:17.897
Well, looks like the odds
on the home team just went up.

01:03:35.426 --> 01:03:38.054
What I've done
is programmed the command system...

01:03:38.229 --> 01:03:40.925
...to take its cues from your hard drive.

01:03:41.499 --> 01:03:44.434
I've also rigged it to work as
an auxiliary power unit.

01:03:44.769 --> 01:03:47.761
So if you ever have a power drain
like yesterday...

01:03:47.939 --> 01:03:52.137
...just interface with the flight pack
and recharge whether you fly or not.

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:55.037
Nikko, see those resistors over there?

01:03:55.213 --> 01:03:56.976
Get them for me, will you?

01:03:57.148 --> 01:03:58.308
<i>Get them for me, will you?</i>

01:04:03.554 --> 01:04:05.351
<i>Get them for me.</i>

01:04:06.491 --> 01:04:08.083
<i>Promise me.</i>

01:04:10.528 --> 01:04:12.086
<i>Get them for me.</i>

01:04:13.564 --> 01:04:15.191
<i>Promise me.</i>

01:04:26.911 --> 01:04:28.242
What's going on?

01:04:28.846 --> 01:04:29.972
Excuse me.

01:04:33.184 --> 01:04:34.412
Hey, where you going?

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.013
Unfinished business.

01:04:44.162 --> 01:04:45.993
It's okay. He'll be back.

01:04:46.164 --> 01:04:47.825
He needs us too.

01:04:49.033 --> 01:04:50.125
Where's he going?

01:04:52.036 --> 01:04:53.503
To keep a promise.

01:04:54.772 --> 01:04:57.832
You got a Robocop.
You got an alien cop?

01:04:58.309 --> 01:05:00.869
- Got a ghost cop?
- I don't have time for...

01:05:01.045 --> 01:05:02.444
You got a vampire cop?

01:05:08.052 --> 01:05:11.044
- Murphy.
- Good evening, Sergeant Reed.

01:05:11.389 --> 01:05:14.187
Do you know there's a warrant
out for your arrest?

01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:15.449
Yes.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.320
I was just checking.
What can I do for you?

01:05:18.496 --> 01:05:21.522
Please direct me
to the Rehab Staging Area.

01:05:21.866 --> 01:05:24.767
It's down the hall.
You can't miss it.

01:05:25.436 --> 01:05:26.403
Thank you.

01:05:31.375 --> 01:05:33.935
You may want to call
the fire department.

01:05:45.056 --> 01:05:46.853
- You got a light?
- Sure, man.

01:05:47.024 --> 01:05:48.582
Allow me, scum.

01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:21.480
Oh, shit.

01:06:38.042 --> 01:06:39.407
Where's McDaggett?

01:06:55.526 --> 01:06:58.154
<i>That does not look like
a police station.</i>

01:06:58.329 --> 01:07:00.854
You're damn right
I'm not at the station.

01:07:01.032 --> 01:07:04.229
If my spy hadrt warned me,
I'd be dead now.

01:07:04.869 --> 01:07:08.327
I thought your damn ninja was
supposed to take care of Robocop.

01:07:08.506 --> 01:07:12.966
That's the deal. I clear the area,
he keeps the robot off my back.

01:07:13.544 --> 01:07:16.809
<i>You have the device I sent you?</i>

01:07:21.018 --> 01:07:24.044
It hasn't come to that yet.
And it won't. Relax.

01:07:24.222 --> 01:07:28.522
<i>It is difficult for me to continue
our business relationship...</i>

01:07:28.826 --> 01:07:30.987
<i>...when I don't know your methods.</i>

01:07:31.329 --> 01:07:33.820
You don't need to know my methods.

01:07:33.998 --> 01:07:37.365
I said I'll clear the area
and I'll clear it.

01:07:38.336 --> 01:07:41.965
Just get the robot cop off my back.

01:07:54.485 --> 01:07:59.115
I understand you're willing to pay good
money to know where the rebel base is.

01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:00.279
Yes, well...

01:08:02.393 --> 01:08:03.917
...the money's good...

01:08:05.396 --> 01:08:06.522
...if the tip's good.

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:15.564
The last tip saved your ass,
didn't it?

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:34.850
What do we have here?

01:08:35.826 --> 01:08:37.316
You don't like men in uniform?

01:08:37.495 --> 01:08:40.362
My dad lost his job.
I just need some money.

01:08:40.531 --> 01:08:43.898
- We've got lots of money, honey.
- Don't.

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:46.868
- No!
- She said, "No."

01:08:49.473 --> 01:08:51.770
Maybe you have a hearing problem?

01:08:56.846 --> 01:08:58.144
Go home, young lady.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:01.385
You are in violation of curfew.

01:09:12.930 --> 01:09:14.227
Where's McDaggett?

01:09:17.768 --> 01:09:19.064
Room 212.

01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:20.328
Thank you.

01:09:21.439 --> 01:09:23.270
I hope you are insured.

01:09:24.975 --> 01:09:26.466
Elevator door sticks!

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:48.154
Don't.

01:10:00.845 --> 01:10:03.405
I have a message from officer Lewis.

01:10:19.497 --> 01:10:20.794
Stop!

01:10:23.267 --> 01:10:24.393
Drive!

01:10:25.136 --> 01:10:27.001
I said, drive, goddamn it, drive!

01:10:36.113 --> 01:10:40.072
My time, my money. I told you
and won't tell you again, understand?

01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:43.550
I must commandeer your vehicle
for police use.

01:10:43.888 --> 01:10:46.015
What is your problem, sucker?

01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:50.520
I mean, officer.

01:12:01.398 --> 01:12:02.365
Cover me.

01:12:54.919 --> 01:12:56.318
Commander!

01:13:19.176 --> 01:13:21.269
What's the deal?

01:13:33.090 --> 01:13:35.388
Where the hell is Robocop?

01:13:37.094 --> 01:13:40.188
We could drive around
and listen for explosions.

01:13:47.938 --> 01:13:48.927
Are you doing that?

01:13:49.106 --> 01:13:52.303
I got tired of splicing wires,
so I put in a pulse tach decoder.

01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:54.307
- Telemetric?
- No.

01:13:54.478 --> 01:13:57.777
- Smart ass.
- I know you are, but what am I?

01:13:58.449 --> 01:13:59.973
Here, let me try.

01:14:10.894 --> 01:14:12.987
Thanks for the heart attack.

01:14:13.163 --> 01:14:16.530
I believe I will go
and send out a recon team.

01:14:17.067 --> 01:14:18.796
I got a better idea.

01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:22.164
Why don't we just all have a seat.

01:14:22.973 --> 01:14:24.201
And relax.

01:14:24.775 --> 01:14:27.073
It'll all be over in a few minutes.

01:14:27.411 --> 01:14:29.777
You son of a bitch.

01:14:30.014 --> 01:14:32.414
Watch the language,
there's children present.

01:14:36.353 --> 01:14:37.945
Drop it, Coontz.

01:14:40.324 --> 01:14:43.191
I'm not going to ask twice.

01:14:48.532 --> 01:14:51.797
What do you mean, "it'll all be over
in a few minutes"?

01:14:54.872 --> 01:14:57.102
Get the kids out of here! Now!

01:15:11.388 --> 01:15:12.980
Bertha!

01:15:17.861 --> 01:15:18.828
Go.

01:15:22.399 --> 01:15:24.390
- Got to get her.
- Go!

01:15:26.136 --> 01:15:27.831
Come on, let's go! Come on!

01:15:48.058 --> 01:15:49.286
Come on.

01:15:54.098 --> 01:15:56.089
Come on! Get in! Come on!

01:15:58.569 --> 01:15:59.536
Come on!

01:16:03.173 --> 01:16:04.162
Okay, now go!

01:16:04.942 --> 01:16:07.968
- Go on!
- No, it's happening again!

01:16:08.145 --> 01:16:10.045
Don't let them take you away.

01:16:16.353 --> 01:16:18.014
I said, go! Get out of here!

01:16:34.204 --> 01:16:35.330
Where is he?

01:16:37.975 --> 01:16:38.964
Go to hell.

01:16:39.376 --> 01:16:41.105
Take her to headquarters.

01:16:41.311 --> 01:16:44.246
I promise my men won't leave
a mark on you.

01:16:49.887 --> 01:16:53.084
Sir. What about our friend Coontz?

01:16:54.224 --> 01:16:57.250
If we'd let him live,
we'd have to have paid him.

01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:10.169
We're talking about hundreds
of thousands of dollars in damage.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.366
- Murphy can be rough on properties.
- Yeah. Well...

01:17:13.544 --> 01:17:16.911
...every cent of it will be coming out
of your salaries.

01:17:17.281 --> 01:17:19.340
Hey! You built him!

01:17:27.391 --> 01:17:29.052
We're taking Cadillac Heights.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:33.958
I'll need 50 of your men armed and in full
body armor in one hour. Johnson...

01:17:34.164 --> 01:17:38.863
...tell the CEo the demolition crews will
have access at 0600 hours tomorrow.

01:17:39.036 --> 01:17:42.472
Hey, we don't do that kind of work.

01:17:42.773 --> 01:17:44.934
That was a direct order, sergeant.

01:17:45.142 --> 01:17:48.475
Driving people out of their homes
is no work for a cop!

01:17:48.812 --> 01:17:49.972
Now, sergeant.

01:17:51.348 --> 01:17:54.977
Fifteen years on the force
is quite an investment.

01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:56.948
Your job, your pension.

01:17:57.254 --> 01:18:01.850
Maybe instead of worrying about these
squatters, think about your own family.

01:18:02.993 --> 01:18:04.187
I am.

01:18:13.203 --> 01:18:16.070
I'm thinking I have to go home
and face them.

01:18:32.389 --> 01:18:34.016
You can't do this.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.858
You are employees of oCP!

01:18:40.030 --> 01:18:41.224
Now remember that.

01:18:43.133 --> 01:18:46.102
You're jeopardizing
your retirement benefits!

01:18:59.116 --> 01:19:00.174
Stop that man.

01:19:05.956 --> 01:19:08.925
How would you and your friends
like to make some money?

01:19:21.405 --> 01:19:22.337
<i>- It's...
- Johnny...</i>

01:19:22.506 --> 01:19:23.871
<i>- Rehab!
- Hurray!</i>

01:19:38.889 --> 01:19:42.848
<i>Johnny Rehab action figures, parts
and accessories all sold separately.</i>

01:19:43.894 --> 01:19:46.089
<i>Three nuns and five clergy are dead...</i>

01:19:46.263 --> 01:19:50.461
<i>...in what is believed to be the latest
atrocity by the killer cyborg, Robocop.</i>

01:19:50.901 --> 01:19:52.960
<i>The OCP claim the former police unit...</i>

01:19:53.136 --> 01:19:56.003
<i>...is responsible for a spree
of terrorism...</i>

01:19:56.173 --> 01:20:00.007
<i>...in the Cadillac Heights section
of Old Detroit.</i>

01:20:00.911 --> 01:20:02.936
<i>I'm sorry, I can't even read this.</i>

01:20:04.047 --> 01:20:06.447
<i>This is bullshit!
Are you buying this?</i>

01:20:07.584 --> 01:20:10.917
Are you kidding me? Robocop?

01:21:12.883 --> 01:21:14.180
Marie.

01:21:27.397 --> 01:21:28.989
Lousy sons of bitches!

01:21:29.900 --> 01:21:33.301
<i>- OCP bastards!
- Nobody is listening to you, sweetheart.</i>

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.907
<i>We are in position.</i>

01:21:38.075 --> 01:21:42.011
This is Big Stick. You have a green.
Arm and proceed to strike zone.

01:21:42.779 --> 01:21:44.974
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

01:21:45.182 --> 01:21:47.810
<i>All teams, we have a green.</i>

01:21:48.852 --> 01:21:50.251
Hey, take it easy.

01:22:14.511 --> 01:22:17.503
- So what now?
- What now?

01:22:17.914 --> 01:22:21.406
- Game's over, Moreno. Just shut up.
- What about Bertha's plan?

01:22:22.052 --> 01:22:24.077
Damn it! Bertha's dead!

01:22:27.390 --> 01:22:29.017
I'm sorry.

01:22:52.983 --> 01:22:55.281
Folks, in about 45 minutes...

01:22:55.418 --> 01:22:58.785
...the Rehabs are coming
to blow you out of your neighborhood.

01:22:58.955 --> 01:23:00.354
I want you to take your kids...

01:23:00.557 --> 01:23:04.015
...and anybody who shouldn't be fighting
to the basement!

01:23:04.761 --> 01:23:08.891
The rest of you are hereby deputized
by the Detroit Police Department.

01:23:10.867 --> 01:23:13.768
It's time to show
how real cops kick ass.

01:24:30.013 --> 01:24:33.278
Detroit Police! Identify yourself.

01:24:38.488 --> 01:24:41.184
You are under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

01:24:52.168 --> 01:24:54.864
And destruction of police property.

01:25:36.012 --> 01:25:37.070
Quiet!

01:25:37.247 --> 01:25:38.441
Quiet!

01:25:42.319 --> 01:25:46.551
Hold your fire
until absolutely necessary.

01:27:13.977 --> 01:27:15.001
Commander...

01:27:15.178 --> 01:27:18.409
...Detroit Police are out there, sir.
They're fighting against us.

01:27:18.581 --> 01:27:21.414
So? We have a schedule to keep.

01:27:21.584 --> 01:27:25.281
We don't fire on police officers!
You're out of line, McDaggett.

01:27:25.455 --> 01:27:27.889
I'm in charge here. I'm pulling the plug.

01:27:28.291 --> 01:27:29.417
Sit down.

01:27:29.793 --> 01:27:31.192
Have you gone war-wacky?

01:27:34.864 --> 01:27:38.027
I said, sit down.

01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:41.896
Good idea.

01:27:48.945 --> 01:27:50.435
How are we getting out of here anyway?

01:27:54.818 --> 01:27:56.877
How'd you get...? Never mind.

01:27:57.053 --> 01:27:58.782
Is there a transmission dish outside?

01:27:58.955 --> 01:28:02.356
Yeah, and I was just watching
the Media Break guy pick his nose.

01:28:02.525 --> 01:28:04.459
Do you have your computer with you?

01:28:09.165 --> 01:28:10.496
<i>People of Detroit...</i>

01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:14.392
<i>...this is an illegal broadcast.
It may be cut off at any time.</i>

01:28:14.571 --> 01:28:16.232
<i>So listen to me.</i>

01:28:16.406 --> 01:28:18.340
<i>OCP is lying to you.</i>

01:28:18.508 --> 01:28:21.068
<i>They're destroying people's lives
for big business.</i>

01:28:25.515 --> 01:28:27.142
<i>Those Rehabs you see on TV...</i>

01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:31.878
<i>...they're mercenaries hired by OCP
to throw people out of their homes.</i>

01:28:40.530 --> 01:28:42.430
<i>You've got to believe me.</i>

01:28:43.166 --> 01:28:46.101
<i>I'm speaking for all the homeless
and jobless citizens of this city...</i>

01:28:46.269 --> 01:28:50.433
<i>...and every city like it run by
heartless capitalist scumbags...</i>

01:28:59.549 --> 01:29:03.952
<i>OCP doesn't care about people.
OCP cares about...</i>

01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:11.484
<i>Your neighborhood is next
unless you fight back now.</i>

01:29:11.828 --> 01:29:14.353
<i>Time's running out. OCP's the enemy.</i>

01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:22.060
<i>I repeat. Time is running out.
OCP is the enemy.</i>

01:29:22.472 --> 01:29:24.906
<i>Help us. Innocent people are dying.</i>

01:29:54.771 --> 01:29:56.796
- More ammo!
- More ammo!

01:30:18.461 --> 01:30:19.450
Zack's hit!

01:30:25.535 --> 01:30:28.060
They're winning, aren't they, sergeant?

01:30:39.549 --> 01:30:41.278
What in the name...?

01:31:10.847 --> 01:31:12.109
Sir?

01:31:26.195 --> 01:31:28.789
Splatter that, you sons of bitches!

01:31:47.784 --> 01:31:49.183
<i>Come in, Big Stick.</i>

01:31:53.323 --> 01:31:55.814
All right, Mr. Robocop.

01:31:56.059 --> 01:31:57.356
Come and get me.

01:32:01.531 --> 01:32:03.055
Get away from the door.

01:32:17.413 --> 01:32:18.937
Think it over.

01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:23.976
Oh, my God, Johnson,
our stock has dropped to nothing.

01:32:24.253 --> 01:32:25.345
We're ruined.

01:32:44.340 --> 01:32:46.433
How may I help you, officer?

01:32:46.943 --> 01:32:48.570
By resisting arrest.

01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:50.811
Don't count on it, chum.

01:32:51.214 --> 01:32:53.114
Anyway, what's the charge?

01:32:53.282 --> 01:32:55.944
The murder of Anne Lewis.

01:32:57.887 --> 01:33:00.412
Dead or alive, you're coming with me.

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:32.543
McDaggett, you can have oCP.
It's all yours. Sayonara.

01:33:32.889 --> 01:33:34.379
Where're you going?

01:33:34.557 --> 01:33:36.491
You're gonna miss all the fun.

01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:27.307
No flashy bravery, tin man.

01:34:27.477 --> 01:34:29.536
Or the two cuties say, "Bye-bye."

01:34:30.079 --> 01:34:31.842
What are you doing?

01:34:32.014 --> 01:34:33.413
What are you doing?

01:34:41.557 --> 01:34:43.889
Stop them! Stop them!

01:34:53.536 --> 01:34:55.766
Stupid fools!

01:34:55.938 --> 01:34:58.429
Don't you know what you've done to us?!

01:34:59.475 --> 01:35:02.774
Those androids are programmed
with a thermal fail-safe device.

01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:06.142
You mean to self-destruct?

01:35:06.349 --> 01:35:08.977
In 15 seconds,
everything within 20 yards...

01:35:09.151 --> 01:35:11.551
...of where we're standing
will be atomized.

01:35:11.888 --> 01:35:14.254
We're dead, you stupid slag.

01:35:14.423 --> 01:35:16.891
Don't count on it, chum.

01:35:26.135 --> 01:35:27.864
Hang on.

01:35:51.527 --> 01:35:54.826
- Come on.
- Let me give you a hand.

01:36:22.391 --> 01:36:24.859
Kanemitsu-san...

01:36:25.061 --> 01:36:27.029
...I realize that it looks bad...

01:36:27.196 --> 01:36:30.063
...but maybe our plans were
over-ambitious.

01:36:30.232 --> 01:36:32.792
Let's start a skoshy bit smaller.

01:36:32.969 --> 01:36:36.564
Let's gentrify this neighborhood.
Build strip malls.

01:36:36.906 --> 01:36:40.899
Fast-food chains. Lots of popular
entertainment. What do you think?

01:36:46.882 --> 01:36:48.372
- What did he say?
- You're fired.

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.205
I got to hand it to you.

01:37:21.384 --> 01:37:22.976
What do they call you?

01:37:23.452 --> 01:37:25.420
Murphy, is it?

01:37:25.488 --> 01:37:27.786
My friends call me Murphy.

01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.459
You call me...

01:37:32.762 --> 01:37:34.093
...Robocop.
