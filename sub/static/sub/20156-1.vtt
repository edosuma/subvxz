00:21.788 --> 00:23.022
Speed it up, will you?

00:23.024 --> 00:24.356
You drive like my granny.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.991
We're moving with the flow of traffic.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.359
When do I get to drive?

00:27.361 --> 00:29.528
My car, so, never.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.563
Ooh, I'm gonna sign in
this thing called Twitter.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.366
You put up what you're
thinking like, "I love pizza,"

00:34.368 --> 00:38.237
or "I'm having pizza now",
or even "pizza is awesome."

00:38.239 --> 00:41.106
All your thoughts don't
have to be pizza related.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.241
Says who?

00:42.243 --> 00:43.475
Hey, I could order a pizza,

00:43.477 --> 00:45.511
while we're puttering along here.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.812
Ooh, great idea.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.947
Gonna have pizza soon.

00:48.949 --> 00:50.215
First twit sent.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.784
What the heck is that?

00:55.289 --> 00:57.122
- Flash, go find out.
- On it.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.628
- Report.
- You need to see for yourself.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.129
I'm not totally sure.

01:21.548 --> 01:24.616
Big week for us. First, we
stop the fearsome five.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.717
They were so pissed.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.686
"You'll pay for
interfering with us."

01:27.688 --> 01:28.921
Blah, blah, blah.

01:28.923 --> 01:31.323
And now we get to stop an alien brawl.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.597
Which side do we join?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.133
- Really?
- Looks can be deceiving.

01:51.578 --> 01:52.578
Titans, go!

01:54.647 --> 01:57.149
And the fact that she's hot
has nothing to do with it.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.489
Buzz off, lizard lips!

02:04.325 --> 02:05.591
Coming through. Excuse me.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.658
<i>Excusez-moi</i>

02:35.923 --> 02:38.423
I think Rapunzel is trying
to tell us something.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.928
Speedy, you got something
loud to close that thing?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.229
Got you covered, boss.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.048
Whoa!

03:31.911 --> 03:33.679
I did not see that coming.

03:36.783 --> 03:37.916
Thank you.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.452
I am Koriand'r of Tamaran.

03:40.454 --> 03:43.288
Our kind can learn language
from the act of kissing.

03:44.490 --> 03:45.557
Useful.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.198
Are you all right?

03:53.200 --> 03:57.035
My sister, Komand'r, staged
a coup and took the throne.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.370
I had to flee.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.606
But I will soon return.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.908
Well, you can stay with us
until you figure it out.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.276
Okay?

04:06.112 --> 04:07.479
Yes, please.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.048
I will ask sanctuary
for two or three days.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.583
A week at the longest.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.452
Let me introduce you to my friends.

04:16.956 --> 04:19.257
Oh, by the way, I speak some Spanish,

04:19.260 --> 04:20.459
if you wanna learn that.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.060
Second year high school French.

04:24.330 --> 04:26.431
Welcome to the Teen Titans.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.784
Careful, you fool.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.520
This equipment is worth
more than your lives.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.294
What?

05:29.296 --> 05:31.797
<i>The Titans will be
there in less than a minute.</i>

05:33.299 --> 05:35.834
I see no signs of that.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.737
Believe, don't believe, your choice.

06:00.326 --> 06:01.426
They're ready.

06:01.428 --> 06:02.894
They're slow.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.896
I hardly had time to answer a post.

06:08.968 --> 06:11.436
It's a tough climb,
especially in this moonlight.

06:11.438 --> 06:12.471
Nightwing.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.739
They're bound to spot us.

06:13.741 --> 06:14.573
Nightwing.

06:14.575 --> 06:15.907
If we wait for those clouds...

06:15.909 --> 06:16.975
Dick!

06:16.977 --> 06:18.043
What?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.811
Terra is taking us up there.

06:19.813 --> 06:20.979
She is?

06:20.981 --> 06:23.582
Yeah, I do all the dirty work
around here.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.126
Going up.

06:35.361 --> 06:37.462
You've been gone a long time, cowboy.

06:39.165 --> 06:40.432
Let's move.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.214
Quiet down.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.449
The bug is nervous.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.584
I'm not feeling too good
about this myself.

06:59.586 --> 07:00.786
How come you're so calm?

07:00.788 --> 07:02.721
You have never been a gopher.

07:07.894 --> 07:08.960
Hey!

07:08.962 --> 07:10.095
Scarab, stop.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.229
Control that thing, Beetle,

07:11.231 --> 07:13.031
or I'll control it for you.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.699
You're going to have
a sword fight in here?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.635
How about some place roomier
like a broom closet?

07:16.637 --> 07:18.270
Everyone, calm down.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.704
The enemy is above us.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.573
You have to channel
all your thoughts to that.

07:21.575 --> 07:24.109
Remember, these
opponents are different.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.144
Uh, as Kori will tell you.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.979
No, keep going.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.248
I've been studying them
since I left the Titans.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.250
They're zealots, extremists.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.086
They'll sacrifice themselves
without hesitation to get to you.

07:35.088 --> 07:37.456
So, the quicker we
take them down, the better.

07:38.157 --> 07:39.558
That about cover it?

07:39.560 --> 07:40.625
Very well said.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.629
Terra, can you do this?

07:45.698 --> 07:48.533
Yes, if you'd all shut up.

07:54.006 --> 07:56.441
We're six inches under the floor.

07:56.443 --> 07:58.677
Who wants to knock?

08:07.286 --> 08:08.620
Titans, go!

08:21.300 --> 08:25.136
"Thanks for getting us into the
impenetrable H.I.V.E base, Terra."

08:25.138 --> 08:26.705
"Yeah, you're the best."

08:29.842 --> 08:31.743
This bad guy is yours, mama.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.186
Terra, stay with us.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.855
Like I couldn't take out
all these jokers by myself.

08:48.094 --> 08:49.694
We've been compromised.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.263
Abandon the base.

08:59.706 --> 09:00.972
They prepared well.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.574
Their reaction time is much better.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.809
Robin, stop complementing the bad guys.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.145
But he's right.
Be ready for anything.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.783
These dudes must buy their
bad guy stuff in bulk.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.288
How about we do that move
you taught me last weekend?

09:16.290 --> 09:17.856
Now?

09:17.858 --> 09:21.026
I admire your boldness,
but what will the team think?

09:21.028 --> 09:23.161
What? No, not...

09:24.263 --> 09:26.364
Okay, you got me.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.066
The training move, please.

09:59.131 --> 10:00.198
Get in the truck.

10:05.204 --> 10:07.872
Your service has come to an end.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.677
Bless you all.

10:36.702 --> 10:38.803
Watch it, dude.
Those are my friends.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.240
At least act like you're trying to
keep your parasite in line, Beetle.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.750
That was unbearable.

10:52.618 --> 10:53.985
Get it?

10:54.487 --> 10:55.754
Seriously?

11:03.262 --> 11:05.530
Could you not leave yourself
open like that?

11:05.532 --> 11:06.831
I worry.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.299
I'm sorry, babe.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.802
I've been doing
a lot of thinking lately.

11:10.804 --> 11:12.137
About what?

11:20.112 --> 11:22.352
I think we should take the
next step in our relationship.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.283
To be continued.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.165
Say cheese,

11:40.167 --> 11:41.966
and post.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.235
Hey, how about a movie tonight?

11:44.237 --> 11:45.503
Whoa!

11:45.505 --> 11:46.905
Keep moving, Magilla.

11:50.209 --> 11:51.843
The base is ours.

11:55.582 --> 11:58.717
So, what were you saying
before we were interrupted?

11:59.351 --> 12:00.485
I...

12:10.096 --> 12:12.697
Okay, good a place as any.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.466
I got an apartment in the city.

12:14.468 --> 12:17.402
I hoped, maybe,
we could share, you know,

12:17.404 --> 12:18.470
together.

12:18.472 --> 12:19.738
Oh, snap!

12:25.478 --> 12:26.678
No rock?

12:26.680 --> 12:27.946
That's so lame.

12:30.015 --> 12:32.784
On Tamaran, everyone would gossip.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.519
So it's a good thing we live here.

12:38.357 --> 12:40.959
What I'm getting is that they're
too good to hang with us.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.761
Yeah, that's the takeaway.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.332
Hey, I'm over a million followers!

13:16.328 --> 13:17.562
Call me <i>Jefe.</i>

13:17.564 --> 13:19.998
You need to get your head
in the game, Gar.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.136
Or, maybe your head
is in a different game.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.072
Who wouldn't want to date me?
I'm awesome.

13:28.074 --> 13:30.241
But everything I do pisses her off.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.577
Want my advice?

13:32.579 --> 13:35.146
Quit turning into a chimp
and stealing monkey kisses.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.049
People think that's adorable.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.984
Nope, no one thinks that.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.353
Time out.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.088
Gotta make a call.

14:14.286 --> 14:15.353
Terra.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.023
Would you like to join me?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.959
The staff helps clear the mind.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.293
No thanks.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.829
I'm just trying to avoid
green bean for a while.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.397
I never cared much for the zoo.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.534
If he's bothering you...

14:29.536 --> 14:31.903
He's just a jerk.

14:35.107 --> 14:37.442
Is it true what they say about her,

14:37.444 --> 14:40.478
that she has her father trapped
in that Jewel on her head?

14:41.681 --> 14:44.082
Yes, his name is Trigon.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.650
He's a demon.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.987
They have issues.

14:48.989 --> 14:51.556
Well, she knows where she can find him.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.024
You should talk to her more.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.059
You'll find that Raven can be quite

14:55.628 --> 14:57.362
interesting.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.931
No thanks. Too creepy for me.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.474
Sounds like a good time, Milagro.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.109
Did you get my gift?

15:11.111 --> 15:15.513
<i>Sure did. Gift card to the
seventeen forever. My favorite.</i>

15:15.515 --> 15:17.982
Mom and dad wanna say hi.
Love you.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.853
There's my baby boy!

15:21.855 --> 15:23.521
Are you getting enough to eat?

15:25.492 --> 15:27.492
Yeah, how's it goin'?

15:30.397 --> 15:32.096
<i>Still doesn't like me, huh?</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:33.498
It's getting better.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.867
Let's not talk about that thing.

15:35.869 --> 15:37.635
It's been two years.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.003
I'm working on it, dad.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.705
But it's hard, you know.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.006
It's got a mind of its own.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.708
- And a temper.
- Aldo.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.411
For god's sake. He's with
a bunch of super heroes.

15:46.413 --> 15:49.747
<i>You think Superman or someone
could take that thing off him.</i>

15:49.749 --> 15:51.382
<i>You're supposed to calm down.</i>

15:51.384 --> 15:53.885
<i>We can't have every call
end this way, Aldo.</i>

15:53.887 --> 15:55.620
<i>Jaime won't wanna talk to us.</i>

15:57.189 --> 15:58.256
<i>Why is the cake</i>

15:58.258 --> 16:00.558
coming out? It's not time!

16:00.560 --> 16:03.161
Ah, your aunt, Consuela, <i>esta loca.</i>

16:03.163 --> 16:05.463
Go, mom, we can talk later.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.231
I love you, Jaime.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.299
Be good.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.068
Consuela, give me that cake!

16:11.904 --> 16:13.171
I better go too.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.173
I'm sorry. It's just...

16:17.643 --> 16:18.710
I miss my son.

16:40.400 --> 16:44.068
<i>Accessing most
recent footage on brother Blood.</i>

16:44.737 --> 16:45.903
<i>Lies.</i>

16:45.905 --> 16:47.672
<i>My church is a holy place</i>

16:47.674 --> 16:49.874
<i>and we strive only to do good.</i>

16:49.876 --> 16:51.576
<i>Come now, brother Blood.</i>

16:51.578 --> 16:54.012
<i>Isn't your church
just a glorified cult?</i>

16:54.014 --> 16:56.914
<i>Unlike you,
Bryce, I believe in an America</i>

16:56.916 --> 17:00.318
<i>where all beliefs should be
treated with respect.</i>

17:00.320 --> 17:02.453
<i>It's a shame the press doesn't.</i>

17:04.823 --> 17:08.226
<i>I'm afraid that's all we're going
to get from brother Blood.</i>

17:08.228 --> 17:09.694
<i>I'm Bryce Peterson.</i>

17:09.695 --> 17:11.462
<i>Have a good night.</i>

17:11.464 --> 17:13.330
Grandfather would have been
impressed with blood,

17:13.333 --> 17:16.067
running a worldwide cult
as well as H.I.V.E.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.468
They're the same thing.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.369
He just makes them look separate.

17:20.638 --> 17:22.940
Do you ever get out of that uniform?

17:22.942 --> 17:24.541
Only when I bathe.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.609
Might be time.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.182
I'm good.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.151
Goin' out.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.786
I hear you're gone a lot.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.555
Where do you go?

17:37.557 --> 17:41.325
You realize I'm not a child who
needs permission to go outside.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.760
Correct?

17:42.762 --> 17:45.596
Damien, I wasn't interrogating.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.798
Just taking an interest.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.000
Oh!

17:49.002 --> 17:51.002
I go out on patrol.

17:51.004 --> 17:54.505
By the way, I should offer congratulations
on your cohabitation, Grayson.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.175
Starfire has proven herself
to be a decent leader.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.143
I approve.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.512
Thank you.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.314
Have you found anything
in the H.I.V.E. Files?

18:03.316 --> 18:06.017
Nothing Earth-shaking,
but I'm still checking.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.252
Sounds like you got squat.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.288
I love endangering my life for nothing.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.024
Which is why I've added
the newest files to the ones

18:13.026 --> 18:15.359
too damaged to read,
from the previous raids.

18:15.361 --> 18:18.229
I'm hoping the computer will
find a connection we missed.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.931
It may take the program a day or two.

18:19.933 --> 18:21.499
Not your worst idea.

18:22.634 --> 18:23.701
What?

18:28.574 --> 18:29.640
Ugh!

18:30.275 --> 18:31.943
Hey, anyone seen Jaime?

18:31.945 --> 18:34.145
Yeah, he's right there.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.850
Something is wrong.

18:38.852 --> 18:41.786
Yeah, there is. He's about to
be crushed at Foosball.

18:41.788 --> 18:42.987
You wanna come see?

18:42.989 --> 18:44.055
Buzz off.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.563
Maybe you should go.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.799
Might be good to have
two of you down there.

18:59.705 --> 19:02.473
<i>And I say to you.
Those who deny the chosen,</i>

19:02.475 --> 19:05.076
<i>have no place in
the Eden that shall be built.</i>

19:05.078 --> 19:09.013
<i>Sinners and blasphemers
who do not share our values</i>

19:09.015 --> 19:11.149
<i>need not apply,</i>

19:11.151 --> 19:12.984
<i>brothers and sisters.</i>

19:12.986 --> 19:14.685
<i>Hail, brother Blood!</i>

19:14.687 --> 19:16.053
<i>Hail, hail, hail.</i>

19:16.055 --> 19:17.722
<i>Hail, brother Blood.</i>

19:17.724 --> 19:18.890
<i>Hail, hail, hail...</i>

19:22.928 --> 19:26.097
Ah, there you are, Mayhem.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.232
Punctual as always.

19:34.039 --> 19:36.641
How can you be so calm?

19:36.643 --> 19:40.244
That was the third base
the Titans have destroyed.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.847
My plan is nine centuries
in the making.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.449
In every age, there are always
those who oppose me.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.851
But as you can see,

19:47.719 --> 19:49.720
I am always victorious.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.827
Is that the reporter?

19:57.663 --> 19:59.063
Yes.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.799
Our friend won't be asking
impertinent questions anymore.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.403
His heresy does not compare
to the titan's threat.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.672
We barely escaped them.

20:07.674 --> 20:09.006
But you did,

20:09.008 --> 20:11.409
because he warned you.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.544
Our guardian angel.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.979
Oh, stop your fretting, Mayhem.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.317
He'll keep the Titans at bay.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.289
I've foreseen it.

20:26.592 --> 20:28.626
Plus, I pay the bastard enough.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.504
Could you slow down, Jaime?

20:40.506 --> 20:42.306
Go back to the tower then.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.708
Nobody asked you to come.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.977
Oh, come on. We're here
to support you.

20:45.979 --> 20:47.245
I'm not.

20:49.114 --> 20:52.850
What I mean is, I respect
Jaime not wanting to talk.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.353
In fact, more people should
learn to shut their mouths.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.787
Well, that's no fun.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.066
Uh, okay, I give up.

21:09.068 --> 21:10.334
The center.

21:10.336 --> 21:13.004
My parents volunteer
for the one in my town.

21:13.006 --> 21:14.071
And...

21:14.073 --> 21:15.840
Maybe I should volunteer.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.575
Yeah, right.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.311
We're Titans.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.746
We don't serve soup.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.214
You don't have to move a mountain

21:23.216 --> 21:25.349
to help people, Terra.

21:25.351 --> 21:27.285
Besides, I gotta find a way
to make the bug

21:27.287 --> 21:29.287
more comfortable around humans.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.028
Can I help you?

21:37.030 --> 21:38.095
Yes, um,

21:38.097 --> 21:39.730
Traci.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.433
I was wondering who I can
speak to about volunteering?

21:42.435 --> 21:43.768
That would be me.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.570
And there it is.

21:46.572 --> 21:47.938
Just because we have powers

21:47.940 --> 21:50.007
doesn't mean we can't, you know,

21:50.009 --> 21:51.442
have relationships.

21:51.444 --> 21:52.710
Don't you think?

21:55.914 --> 21:58.416
Hey, there's nothing wrong
with having a life, right?

21:59.685 --> 22:00.718
Kill her!

22:00.720 --> 22:02.253
Kill the demon!

22:03.990 --> 22:05.056
What's the matter?

22:09.961 --> 22:11.262
Nothing.

22:11.264 --> 22:12.930
This is lame. I'm out.

22:20.939 --> 22:24.809
For nearly a millennium, I have
bathed in my enemy's blood,

22:24.811 --> 22:26.777
and for some mysterious reason,

22:26.779 --> 22:29.246
it has provided me immortality.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.115
I have often wondered why?

22:31.117 --> 22:32.350
Why me?

22:32.352 --> 22:33.884
But now I know.

22:35.287 --> 22:38.222
It was meant to bring me to this age,

22:38.224 --> 22:40.358
this place, this moment,

22:40.360 --> 22:46.497
where technology can at last
be made to serve my greatness.

22:47.632 --> 22:48.733
Proceed.

23:40.552 --> 23:42.086
You've done well.

23:42.088 --> 23:44.922
Advance the preparations,
Mayhem. The time has come

23:44.924 --> 23:49.627
for us to move from
immortality to glory.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.563
Your service has come to an end.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.532
Bless you, my son.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.448
For a space Princess,

24:10.450 --> 24:12.016
you sure have a lot of stuff.

24:17.055 --> 24:19.657
I've had this
since I was a little girl.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.826
It was the only thing
I had time to take.

24:26.264 --> 24:28.232
Not again.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.839
Terra, are you okay?

24:34.841 --> 24:36.540
She's going to bring the building down.

24:36.542 --> 24:37.975
I can help.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.981
What are you doing?

24:43.983 --> 24:45.082
Get off me!

24:45.084 --> 24:47.384
You were shaking everything, Terra.

24:47.386 --> 24:48.686
We came to check on you.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.753
Are you all right?

24:49.755 --> 24:51.422
It's a freaking nightmare.

24:51.424 --> 24:53.123
Just leave me alone.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.027
I'm okay, so, get going.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.963
You heard me. Get going.

25:01.933 --> 25:03.133
You too, greeny.

25:09.641 --> 25:10.774
Does that happen a lot?

25:10.776 --> 25:12.142
It happens enough.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.513
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

25:15.515 --> 25:18.315
And if I did see anything,
it wouldn't be your business.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.685
Everything that goes on
in the tower is my business.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.988
Just like it should be for all of you.

25:23.990 --> 25:27.992
The last I checked, Damien,
Kori was in charge, not you.

25:34.132 --> 25:38.202
So good to see you again, my friends.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.970
It's been too long.

25:41.339 --> 25:44.108
Too long.

25:44.110 --> 25:47.011
Don't make this weirder
than it already is, blood.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.647
Are you referring to the setting?

25:49.649 --> 25:51.882
I myself take strength from it.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.653
The cemetery isn't a place
to be feared.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.288
It's a place of renewal.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.356
I have no problem meeting
anywhere you want,

25:59.358 --> 26:02.826
but I get concerned when
my employer talks to himself.

26:03.495 --> 26:05.563
I talk to the dead,

26:05.565 --> 26:11.201
for no matter how rotted the corpse,
there's always a tiny wisp of life left.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.938
Sometimes enough life
to bring them back.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.273
You of all people should know that.

26:19.110 --> 26:20.311
What do you want, blood?

26:20.313 --> 26:22.846
I want to move everything up by a week.

26:22.848 --> 26:24.748
I've waited long enough, Deathstroke.

26:24.750 --> 26:27.217
That wasn't the deal.

26:27.219 --> 26:29.420
I'll double your price.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.555
Is that acceptable?

26:31.557 --> 26:34.992
As before, I want all the Titans.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.094
Can you do it?

26:42.834 --> 26:44.668
To be ready for anything,

26:44.670 --> 26:46.937
you must train for everything.

26:48.206 --> 26:49.840
That was the most important lesson

26:49.842 --> 26:52.676
instilled in me by
the warlords of Okaara.

26:53.511 --> 26:55.145
Them again?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.547
Dude...

26:56.549 --> 26:59.316
And so it shall be instilled in you.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.584
Let's pair off.

27:00.586 --> 27:03.087
Those not fighting, watch and learn.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.221
Nightwing.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.796
Shall we dance, good sir?

27:12.798 --> 27:14.665
But of course, my lady.

27:34.085 --> 27:37.388
Guess we know who's taking out
the garbage at the new place.

27:37.390 --> 27:41.659
That was not a confidence booster.

27:41.661 --> 27:42.893
You did very well.

27:42.895 --> 27:45.329
You lasted far longer this time.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.599
I meant in training, of course.

27:48.601 --> 27:50.200
He's very proficient when we have...

27:50.202 --> 27:51.268
Kori!

27:52.837 --> 27:54.438
Blue Beetle, Raven.

28:12.123 --> 28:14.792
Sorry, Raven, the bug
doesn't wanna lose.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.427
And you do?

28:25.403 --> 28:28.839
<i>Dios mio!</i> I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

28:28.841 --> 28:31.909
What the hell are you doing?

28:31.911 --> 28:34.011
Ah, I'm fine.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.249
But dad feels I've disgraced myself.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.317
So that's nice.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.456
Beast Boy, Terra, you ready?

28:49.294 --> 28:51.261
Right. Sorry.

28:52.831 --> 28:54.932
I'll take it easy on Terra.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.067
I'm gonna enjoy shutting you up.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.336
Only if you catch me, mama.

29:19.357 --> 29:22.760
<i>Mon Cherie,</i> let Garfield
give you a big hug.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.828
Mmm, so soft.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.297
I let you go for a little kiss.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.148
Kill her!

29:47.852 --> 29:51.522
Now, witch, you get
what's coming to you!

29:52.390 --> 29:54.024
Who you calling a witch?

30:01.766 --> 30:03.167
Terra!

30:05.436 --> 30:07.404
She's going to kill him!

30:12.811 --> 30:14.144
Argh!

30:15.947 --> 30:18.115
Terra, control yourself!

30:18.117 --> 30:19.383
What?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.018
What's going on?

30:23.656 --> 30:26.857
I'm sorry, it's not my fault.

30:26.859 --> 30:28.692
- Let me calm your mind.
- No!

30:28.694 --> 30:32.496
- Don't touch me.
- It's okay Terra, we understand.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.831
Take a breath.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.399
We're here for you.

30:35.401 --> 30:39.036
Yeah. I know you didn't mean to hurt me.
I took it too far.

30:41.906 --> 30:44.341
What's wrong with you people?

31:05.663 --> 31:09.867
I know what you're going to say.
Terra needs more training.

31:09.869 --> 31:11.935
No, it's something else.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.470
She knows.

31:16.541 --> 31:19.476
Since we talked, I have sensed
something off about Terra.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.478
She needs to be watched, Grayson.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.748
She needs understanding
not surveillance.

31:24.750 --> 31:28.652
Terra, has her rough edges. But
Corey thinks she's worth it.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.320
And I agree.

31:30.322 --> 31:33.957
Making decisions with your
heart will get people killed.

32:01.219 --> 32:05.255
It's not like I can't sense the
vibrations of someone following me.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.291
Even if they are on a roof.

32:07.293 --> 32:10.694
I know what it's like not
to fit in with the group.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.930
What's wrong?

32:12.932 --> 32:18.001
Aside from monkey boy making me melt
down, or Raven staring all the time,

32:18.003 --> 32:22.239
Nightwing, acting like a den
mother, Jaime and his freako bug,

32:22.241 --> 32:25.943
miss smiles-a-lot,
and you, my new stalker,

32:26.577 --> 32:28.478
huh, nothing I guess.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.449
If you need to talk

32:32.451 --> 32:34.418
let us help you.

32:34.420 --> 32:38.322
Such an observant, considerate boy.

32:38.324 --> 32:40.657
You would think he truly cares.

32:41.893 --> 32:45.028
Slade? Look what hell
just spit up.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.397
Stay back.

32:50.068 --> 32:54.671
Let me guess, they got you to
a Lazarus pit, just in time.

32:54.673 --> 32:58.308
Yes, I've been bathing in it
quite a bit, lately.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.444
You might say, it's addictive.

33:04.015 --> 33:06.049
Improves muscle tone too.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.933
Losing your edge.

33:22.935 --> 33:25.202
Your friends have made you soft.

33:35.780 --> 33:38.382
Like I said, soft.

33:46.891 --> 33:48.759
Took you long enough.

33:55.833 --> 33:58.402
You betrayed us, why?

33:59.804 --> 34:01.805
Betrayed?

34:01.807 --> 34:05.242
That assumes I was ever on
your side in the first place.

34:17.989 --> 34:20.290
There you go, Mr. Fernandez.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.594
- Great to have your help. Thanks.
- No.

34:24.596 --> 34:25.962
Thank you.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.964
I kinda needed this.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.233
This just reminds me of home.

34:30.235 --> 34:34.103
- Ow! Huh, hot.
- Careful.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.408
You don't wanna get burned.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.379
Do you hear that?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.781
- I heard it before.
- Uh...

34:44.783 --> 34:46.283
I hope there's not a short.

34:46.284 --> 34:48.452
I think I heard it move over there.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.023
I know my pulse is racing.

34:53.025 --> 34:54.891
But I'm in no danger. None.

34:54.893 --> 35:00.797
Defensive measures are not needed.
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

35:00.799 --> 35:04.434
There's something humans
call sexual attraction.

35:05.203 --> 35:07.170
Aye, my life.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.540
Uh, Jaime?

35:23.654 --> 35:26.456
What are you doing?

35:26.458 --> 35:29.292
I thought I'd get more comfortable.

35:30.495 --> 35:31.962
Don't.

35:31.964 --> 35:34.498
You can't run over here at
the first sign of trouble.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.867
I was losing it.
I had to see you.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.136
Luckily taking Robin out works.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.971
Grabs a handful.

35:40.973 --> 35:43.273
Best to get him out of the way.

35:43.941 --> 35:45.242
He was suspicious.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.810
Always is.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.213
Didn't say he was stupid.

35:50.215 --> 35:53.283
He damaged the camera lens.

35:53.285 --> 35:55.752
Greenie was asking for it.

35:58.089 --> 36:02.659
It's taken a year to get the information
I need to defeat theTitans.

36:02.661 --> 36:05.896
Could've ruined everything.
Stay still.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.907
- Kill her!
- Kill the witch!

36:18.176 --> 36:20.210
Kill the witch!
She's a demon!

36:20.212 --> 36:21.711
Kill her now!

36:41.599 --> 36:44.401
Leave or die. Your choice.

36:51.709 --> 36:53.343
Terra Markov?

36:55.012 --> 36:57.247
I heard you're a special girl.

36:57.249 --> 36:58.882
Is that true?

36:59.984 --> 37:01.551
My name is Slade.

37:03.521 --> 37:05.589
Looks like I got it.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.391
Not yet, you haven't.

37:09.026 --> 37:10.860
But you could.

37:10.862 --> 37:14.464
- We discussed this.
- I'm not a kid.

37:14.466 --> 37:17.500
- You said we'd be together.
- Not yet.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.669
The contract is everything.

37:19.671 --> 37:22.606
We need total concentration for it.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.674
You know it's taken
a lot of work to get here.

37:24.676 --> 37:27.811
- Especially by you.
- I don't wanna go back.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.847
The Titans are always
acting like they care so much.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.882
It messes with my head.

37:33.951 --> 37:35.619
Just a little longer, Terra.

37:35.621 --> 37:39.155
With the money from blood we'll
form our own league of assassins.

37:39.157 --> 37:40.690
You and I.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.594
Together in every way.

37:57.008 --> 38:01.077
I didn't see you bringing quite
so many weapons to our new place.

38:01.079 --> 38:04.781
- If you don't like them...
- No, no. They're great.

38:07.885 --> 38:08.985
Is something up?

38:11.322 --> 38:14.224
After the incident
at the training field

38:14.226 --> 38:17.694
you met with members
of the team without me.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.864
Yeah, we talked.
But it wasn't a meeting.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.233
Kori, you know I'd never
undermine you, right?

38:23.235 --> 38:24.768
They went to you.

38:24.770 --> 38:28.305
You were...
Are a great leader.

38:28.307 --> 38:31.541
So, they instinctively look
to you, now that you're back.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.712
After all, I'm not even
from your world.

38:38.182 --> 38:40.784
Hey. Stop.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.586
You were chosen
by the team to lead them.

38:43.588 --> 38:47.490
And have I told you how glad I am that
you've chosen to move in with me?

38:47.492 --> 38:50.093
At least I was your first
choice for that.

38:50.095 --> 38:53.897
Yeah. Well, Gar's got his house and
Jaime couldn't afford the rent.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.932
You brat.

39:00.871 --> 39:03.139
Damian! Of course.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.641
Perfect timing.

39:07.278 --> 39:09.846
- Solo?
- He's working on something.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.881
Have I mentioned he approves of us?

39:11.883 --> 39:13.350
So do I.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.626
Yeah? Problem?

39:24.095 --> 39:25.562
Not yet.

39:26.630 --> 39:28.565
Nice visit.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.169
I know I'm not easy to get close to.

39:33.171 --> 39:34.971
We have that in common, I think.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.840
But I could teach you
some meditation techniques.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.641
It might help you stay in control.

39:40.444 --> 39:42.879
Maybe. Maybe so.

39:42.881 --> 39:47.851
The other reason I'm here is to tell you
the team's assembling in the common room.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.587
I need a minute.
You go on ahead.

40:00.498 --> 40:02.265
They know about Robin.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.466
<i>They don't.</i>

40:03.468 --> 40:05.335
Raven, being nice?

40:05.337 --> 40:07.337
And there's nothing scheduled.

40:07.339 --> 40:08.805
They know I'm working with you.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.107
If they knew,
she wouldn't have come alone.

40:11.109 --> 40:13.209
<i>Unless they wanted
to get my guard down.</i>

40:13.211 --> 40:15.478
I don't think I can take
them all if they're ready.

40:15.480 --> 40:18.581
<i>Calm yourself.
The fools trust you.</i>

40:18.583 --> 40:20.049
<i>Use that.</i>

40:36.033 --> 40:38.435
Surprise!

40:42.773 --> 40:43.807
Shit.

40:43.809 --> 40:46.876
You guys scared me.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.611
We can see that.

40:48.613 --> 40:50.880
- Are those for me?
- They sure are.

40:50.882 --> 40:53.650
For your one year anniversary
as a member of the Titans.

40:53.652 --> 40:56.686
- It was all Raven's idea.
- I...

40:56.688 --> 40:59.222
No one has ever done
anything like this for me.

41:00.224 --> 41:01.658
Thanks.

41:02.193 --> 41:03.827
Thanks a lot.

41:06.497 --> 41:11.201
Dry those tears and let's
get this party started, mama!

41:40.364 --> 41:41.931
The computer's done.

41:41.933 --> 41:45.468
- The one with blood's files.
- Let's take a look.

41:45.470 --> 41:48.872
<i>File reconstruction
and integration complete.</i>

41:52.576 --> 41:55.612
That scientist used
to work for H.I.V.E.

41:55.614 --> 41:57.580
Body never recovered.

41:57.582 --> 42:00.550
Seems his personal lab
is still being paid for

42:00.552 --> 42:03.586
by one of blood's holding companies.

42:03.588 --> 42:05.889
The Titans should look into this.

42:08.826 --> 42:11.895
Beast Boy's sending you
pictures of Terra's party.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.367
Shame you're missing it.

42:17.369 --> 42:21.037
You should go. Playing with
teenagers is about your speed.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.640
I'm not gonna let you bait me, kid.

42:24.241 --> 42:25.808
Oh, what the hell.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.549
Big man.

42:32.551 --> 42:36.953
Why not get me out of here so
I can defend myself properly?

42:36.955 --> 42:40.757
- Unless, you're afraid.
- Really?

42:40.759 --> 42:45.595
You're down to hoping I'm gonna act
like the biggest stooge in a b-movie?

42:45.597 --> 42:48.097
Your outfit said
"give it a shot."

42:49.734 --> 42:53.102
Grandson of the demon's
head, you are not.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.572
You're an entitled brat.

42:55.574 --> 42:59.909
I Rose from nothing while you
had everything handed to you.

42:59.911 --> 43:02.612
You cost me my rightful place.

43:02.614 --> 43:05.648
And the family you betrayed.

43:05.650 --> 43:08.885
They turned on me by choosing you.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.321
You took my old family, Damian.

43:13.857 --> 43:15.458
So I'll take your new one.

43:19.763 --> 43:21.931
I should reply.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.901
"I am well and will
see you soon."

43:27.938 --> 43:30.073
You're more of a dick.

43:31.542 --> 43:35.678
"Undercover. Don't bother me."

43:35.680 --> 43:39.282
Shame I don't have more
time to break you down.

43:39.284 --> 43:44.354
Inside a month, I'd have you bringing
me my pipe and calling me papa.

43:44.356 --> 43:47.924
<i>Slade? Get your
head out of your ass.</i>

43:47.926 --> 43:50.960
- You seeing this?
- And if we do find the scientist,

43:50.962 --> 43:53.596
we want him alive at all cost.

43:53.598 --> 43:55.331
We leave in five minutes.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.772
Be a good boy.

44:28.999 --> 44:31.267
Careful. Watch your spacing.

44:50.354 --> 44:52.755
Any idea what that gizmo is?

44:52.757 --> 44:54.691
Nothing good.

45:00.664 --> 45:02.598
He's deleting.
I vote we stop that.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.133
That makes two of us.

45:04.135 --> 45:08.004
Okay, three.

45:10.474 --> 45:13.776
Step away from the computer.
You won't be hurt.

45:50.714 --> 45:52.815
Go after him. I'll cover you.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.865
We should have stayed at the party.

46:08.867 --> 46:10.466
Quit complaining.

46:19.843 --> 46:21.110
Uh-oh!

46:27.751 --> 46:29.819
Oh, you wanna play?

46:35.726 --> 46:37.827
That's it? Lame.

46:49.773 --> 46:51.841
What do you want to ask him first?

47:06.490 --> 47:07.957
Bad luck for him.

47:07.959 --> 47:09.892
At least it wasn't one of us.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.430
Yes, bad luck.

47:14.432 --> 47:17.233
That we couldn't speak
with him about these.

47:20.504 --> 47:22.371
Maybe he was a fan?

47:28.912 --> 47:31.380
Is it really a surprise
they would study us?

47:31.382 --> 47:33.282
We've been defeating them for months.

47:33.284 --> 47:35.751
And you were after them
even before that.

47:35.753 --> 47:38.187
But this stuff is so in-depth.

47:38.189 --> 47:39.856
Things on genetic makeup.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.724
Theories on Raven's power.

47:41.726 --> 47:43.526
Beast Boy's too.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.261
And Beetle's suit.

47:45.929 --> 47:47.163
What's it for?

47:47.165 --> 47:49.098
We need to get Robin back here.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.967
You know how stubborn he can be.

47:50.969 --> 47:55.104
He's a titan.
He needs to be here.

47:55.106 --> 47:59.475
Nothing like laser-spewing H.I.V.E
drones to take you out of a party mood.

47:59.477 --> 48:03.679
I'm beat and I'm making
lunch at the center tomorrow.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.448
In more exciting news,

48:05.450 --> 48:10.219
I've been invited to be on Kevin
Smith's podcast at Metrocon tomorrow.

48:10.221 --> 48:12.655
Hold up, Starfire's got
something to say.

48:14.024 --> 48:15.992
With what we discovered tonight,

48:15.994 --> 48:18.194
we all need to be extra vigilant

48:18.196 --> 48:21.130
and not take any chances.

48:21.132 --> 48:23.432
Are you kidding me?
It's Kevin Smith.

48:23.434 --> 48:27.203
I didn't say don't do
what you have planned.

48:27.205 --> 48:31.207
But keep your eyes and comm
lines open at all times.

48:31.209 --> 48:35.645
I have a feeling whatever blood is
planning tonight is just a prelude.

48:59.403 --> 49:01.637
Sorry your party was interrupted.

49:02.472 --> 49:04.106
That's the way it goes.

49:04.108 --> 49:06.842
Don't let all that talk
back there shake you up.

49:06.844 --> 49:09.111
You know I got your back.

49:11.081 --> 49:12.682
It's other stuff.

49:13.350 --> 49:14.684
Like what?

49:16.086 --> 49:17.720
I'm all ears.

49:20.924 --> 49:22.558
You've a pretty smile.

49:25.028 --> 49:27.630
Do you know how I became an orphan?

49:28.665 --> 49:30.700
Uh, your parents died?

49:31.401 --> 49:33.269
No.

49:33.271 --> 49:36.405
After I got powers, they freaked.

49:36.407 --> 49:38.607
Thought I was possessed or something.

49:40.577 --> 49:42.111
I'm sorry.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.013
Don't be.

49:44.781 --> 49:46.582
I don't need your pity.

49:49.653 --> 49:52.355
It can be a bond, you know?

49:52.357 --> 49:54.490
Everyone on the team's had it rough.

49:54.492 --> 49:56.325
Yeah.

49:56.327 --> 49:59.562
I can tell Princess sparkle thong knows
all about eating from a dumpster.

49:59.564 --> 50:03.332
Kori is a refugee being stalked
by her homicidal sister.

50:03.334 --> 50:05.368
Jaime has a family that loves him.

50:05.370 --> 50:09.372
And, because of the bug, odds are he's
never seeing them face-to-face again.

50:12.075 --> 50:15.878
I think pain is what makes a hero.

50:15.880 --> 50:20.149
It's like a pressure that either forms
a diamond or grinds you into dust.

50:22.953 --> 50:25.554
But what about you, chuckles?

50:25.556 --> 50:29.025
Aside from an unhealthy online
presence, you're normal.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.096
Yeah, you're green.

50:34.098 --> 50:35.965
You wouldn't change it if you could.

50:35.967 --> 50:37.767
You like the attention.

50:37.769 --> 50:39.101
Besides

50:39.103 --> 50:40.636
it looks okay on you.

51:04.561 --> 51:05.661
Wow.

51:06.630 --> 51:08.264
You didn't kill me.

51:09.066 --> 51:10.533
This time.

51:11.735 --> 51:13.536
Don't get used to it, jerk.

51:17.174 --> 51:19.141
Yes! Yeah!

51:19.143 --> 51:21.477
Whoo-hew! Yeah, baby! Ha-ha!

51:24.148 --> 51:26.215
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

51:27.984 --> 51:29.752
Oh, yeah, baby!

51:29.754 --> 51:31.587
Let's go!

51:36.793 --> 51:38.427
<i>Nice play.</i>

51:38.429 --> 51:40.596
<i>Almost bought it myself.</i>

51:41.631 --> 51:43.432
<i>We move tomorrow.</i>

51:51.741 --> 51:53.409
I'm tired, Gar.

51:54.945 --> 51:57.279
Yeah, sure, totally get it.

52:00.784 --> 52:03.786
See you tomorrow.
And the next day.

52:03.788 --> 52:05.221
Whoo!

52:28.912 --> 52:31.547
Yeah, I got them all in.

52:31.549 --> 52:34.450
Hey, I know I'm a noob but I got this.

52:35.285 --> 52:37.353
See you when you get here, Traci.

52:46.463 --> 52:50.733
The guest of honor with
one million followers is...

52:50.735 --> 52:52.234
Uh, here?

52:56.139 --> 52:57.540
Hello?

52:58.942 --> 53:01.143
Kevin? Other guy?

53:19.095 --> 53:22.264
I think we should look over the
files again, this afternoon.

53:22.266 --> 53:24.567
Make sure we didn't miss anything.

53:24.569 --> 53:25.634
Oh!

53:27.304 --> 53:28.771
Sure thing.

53:28.773 --> 53:32.741
And per your orders,
I'll check on Jaime and Gar.

53:32.743 --> 53:35.744
You don't have to do that, but thanks.

53:35.746 --> 53:37.413
By the way...

53:39.616 --> 53:43.219
The warlords of Okaara didn't
teach me much about cooking.

53:43.221 --> 53:46.121
I think you should pick
something up on the way back.

53:46.123 --> 53:47.623
<i>See you soon, babe.</i>

54:21.691 --> 54:22.925
What's going on?

54:22.927 --> 54:25.227
Not sure. It should be open.

54:25.229 --> 54:26.595
We got a new guy.

54:37.007 --> 54:38.407
Jaime?

54:45.348 --> 54:46.749
Jaime?

55:12.942 --> 55:15.044
Argo!

55:21.384 --> 55:23.952
Titans, Blue Beetle has been taken.

55:23.954 --> 55:25.254
Gather at the tower.

55:27.124 --> 55:30.259
<i>This is Kori and dick.
We're not home now.</i>

55:30.261 --> 55:32.928
<i>So leave a message.</i>

55:32.930 --> 55:36.131
Starfire, pick up if you're there.
I'm going to get Beast Boy.

55:36.133 --> 55:38.067
Get to the tower now.

56:01.057 --> 56:02.424
Argo!

56:05.929 --> 56:07.763
Oh, come on, Gar.

56:13.937 --> 56:15.938
Kori, you here?

56:23.012 --> 56:24.079
Kori.

56:26.683 --> 56:27.750
Argo!

56:29.119 --> 56:31.487
Bad day, Nightwing?

56:31.489 --> 56:33.222
It's about to get worse.

56:33.224 --> 56:35.891
What have you done
with Kori and the others?

56:37.327 --> 56:39.094
Don't fret.

56:39.096 --> 56:41.029
I'm here to take you to them.

56:43.933 --> 56:45.667
Bring it, asshole.

56:52.342 --> 56:54.076
Akido needs work.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.744
Your spacing's for shit.

57:05.622 --> 57:07.756
You're overrated, kid.

57:11.227 --> 57:12.494
Damn it.

57:18.401 --> 57:19.668
Argo!

57:42.792 --> 57:43.859
Argo!

57:49.165 --> 57:50.532
Enough.

57:50.534 --> 57:51.867
Screw this.

58:04.180 --> 58:07.783
You could have died by the
Blade with honor, Grayson.

58:08.985 --> 58:10.152
Loser.

58:15.492 --> 58:16.758
<i>Is it done?</i>

58:20.163 --> 58:22.164
Yeah, we're good.

59:04.541 --> 59:05.841
Argo!

59:26.729 --> 59:28.330
He's lying to you.

59:28.332 --> 59:30.165
About everything.

59:30.167 --> 59:32.568
He had you pegged from the start.

59:33.236 --> 59:34.703
That's how he does it.

59:34.705 --> 59:36.572
Mixing truth with lies.

59:36.574 --> 59:38.473
You're so freaking annoying.

59:38.475 --> 59:40.309
You don't know anything about him.

59:40.311 --> 59:42.110
He saved me.

59:42.112 --> 59:45.647
Let me guess, he kept you isolated.

59:45.649 --> 59:47.215
Dependent.

59:47.217 --> 59:49.685
Told you everyone was your enemy.

59:49.687 --> 59:52.521
Trained you, ruthlessly.

59:52.523 --> 59:55.324
And promised you
exactly what you wanted.

59:57.193 --> 59:59.628
Believe me, I know.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:09.071
I've always hated you.

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:11.540
You and all the others.

01:00:11.542 --> 01:00:14.409
The Titans treated you like family.

01:00:14.411 --> 01:00:16.845
And you threw it all away.

01:00:19.182 --> 01:00:20.749
Stop...

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:23.185
Argo.

01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:25.821
Can't I leave you for two minutes?

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:31.660
I can see why you want him dead.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:54.016
What's wrong?

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.952
In a few hours, we're gone.

01:00:56.954 --> 01:00:58.720
It's as good as done.

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:00.956
Just glad this is over.

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:06.828
You've been in deep cover for a year.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:10.332
It's perfectly normal
to have feelings for them.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:12.768
But after this we can be together.

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.336
Just like you wanted.

01:01:15.338 --> 01:01:16.872
Concentrate on that.

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:44.900
Computer, track Terra Markov's phone.

01:01:44.902 --> 01:01:47.135
<i>Discovered, subject is moving.</i>

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.304
I'll bet she is.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:55.777
<i>Brothers and
sisters, I have spoken many times</i>

01:01:55.779 --> 01:01:57.713
<i>about false gods.</i>

01:01:57.715 --> 01:02:02.250
<i>These so-called heroes with
no allegiance to our cause,</i>

01:02:02.252 --> 01:02:06.354
<i>are nothing but secular idols
and must be ended.</i>

01:02:06.356 --> 01:02:12.194
<i>This is the true house of faith
and I am the one true god.</i>

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:16.298
Hail brother Blood.
Hail, hail!

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:20.102
<i>Today, I am claiming
their powers for us all.</i>

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:23.872
<i>For we are the seeds
of the next generation.</i>

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:26.775
<i>We are the hive of humanity.</i>

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:29.578
<i>And nothing will stand in our way.</i>

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.646
<i>Raise me this holy day.</i>

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.849
<i>The day of blood.</i>

01:02:33.851 --> 01:02:36.118
<i>Hail brother Blood.
Hail...</i>

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:38.420
Place gives me the creeps.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.788
I hear you.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.324
Ugh...

01:02:43.192 --> 01:02:46.495
Huh? Guys, Raven's not moving.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:49.798
Something's keeping me
from using my powers to morph.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.900
Yeah, the machine's doing that.

01:02:51.902 --> 01:02:53.969
But, I'm the one who put you here.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.304
Deathstroke.

01:02:58.074 --> 01:02:59.508
What have you done to Robin?

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:02.410
I beat the crap out of him
for being mouthy.

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.581
Come on, you've all had the urge.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:10.118
Once I get out, I'm gonna
break you into little bits.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.121
It's good to have goals, <i>ese.</i>

01:03:13.123 --> 01:03:17.025
Me, I'm having waffles,
after you're dead.

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:22.731
By the way, can I introduce
you to my assistant?

01:03:22.733 --> 01:03:24.299
I think you've met.

01:03:26.402 --> 01:03:29.137
Hey, team, how's things?

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:31.973
Terra, what did he do to you?

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:35.310
Nothing. And I've asked
a bunch of times.

01:03:35.312 --> 01:03:38.346
Terra was a key part of my plan.

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:40.348
A natural double agent.

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.983
That can't be true.

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:44.019
What can I tell you, Goldilocks.

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:46.288
You win some, you lose some.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.355
We took you in.

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:48.623
Helped you.

01:03:48.625 --> 01:03:50.458
Yeah, well, thanks.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:52.027
Now you're gonna die.

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.965
Geez, not a lot of
gray area there, huh.

01:04:02.705 --> 01:04:04.039
Terra...

01:04:42.511 --> 01:04:45.080
Place reminds me of my parents' church.

01:04:45.082 --> 01:04:46.581
Bunch of crazies.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.083
Insolent trash.

01:04:48.085 --> 01:04:50.185
Who you calling trash?

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:52.387
Keep it together.

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:57.959
Let's be civil to our guests.

01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:00.929
Our business is not yet complete.

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:02.931
Sure it is.

01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.867
You wanted the Titans,
and here they are.

01:05:05.869 --> 01:05:07.702
Not all of them.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:09.771
Not Nightwing.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:12.540
It ruins the machine's symmetry.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:15.844
We agreed some deaths
might be unavoidable.

01:05:15.846 --> 01:05:17.045
Things happen.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:18.747
I accept that.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:22.250
But I told you even in death
there is life to be drawn.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.954
Where is the body? Unless you
have a body, you're one short.

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:31.660
Therefore, our contract
is not complete.

01:05:31.662 --> 01:05:36.331
Happily there is still a path
to the salvation of our deal.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:37.532
Don't you agree?

01:05:41.837 --> 01:05:43.338
Excellent.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.572
Mayhem.

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.108
Argh.

01:05:48.911 --> 01:05:50.545
Terra!

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:53.548
Ugh.

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:56.151
Oh...

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:03.625
I should have charged more.

01:06:03.627 --> 01:06:06.294
With her powers,
you're getting an upgrade.

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.904
Amen.

01:06:15.906 --> 01:06:19.174
Now, our business is complete.

01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:27.015
Slade, help me.

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:35.023
Sorry, kid.
But a contract is a contract.

01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:37.325
You'll pay for this.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:40.061
Oh, it's a shame
you have to go, sweet cheeks.

01:06:40.063 --> 01:06:42.464
We would have been fantastic lovers.

01:06:42.466 --> 01:06:45.367
You know,
since we're both newly single.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:56.344
Let it begin!

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:26.741
You think yourself a holy man, blood?

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:28.009
You're filth.

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:29.844
Take heart, sinner.

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:33.348
You are about to become
part of the greater good.

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:35.817
We're gonna show you the greater good.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:37.752
By kicking your ass.

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:48.396
No god is going to
save you, Deathstroke.

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:52.300
Word to the wise, blood,

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:55.270
whatever you're gonna
do to them, do it quickly.

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:19.861
Not feeling so good.

01:08:19.863 --> 01:08:24.466
I consider their pain a retribution
for their sins against me.

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:26.367
Right.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.636
Have a nice day.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:34.341
Oh, don't leave now, brother.
Everyone stays for this part.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:37.345
What part is that, brother?

01:08:37.346 --> 01:08:45.019
When their powers are transferred
and I ascend to god state.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:51.359
Hail me, brethren, for the moment
of ascendency has arrived.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.529
Hail, brother Blood.
Hail, hail.

01:08:54.531 --> 01:08:57.799
Hail, brother Blood.
Hail, hail.

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.399
Hail, brother Blood. Hail...

01:08:59.402 --> 01:09:04.906
Yes, my children, this vessel
shall now transform me...

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:08.643
And you are witness.

01:09:08.645 --> 01:09:11.179
Hail, brother Blood.
Hail, hail.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.616
I feel it.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.152
Yes!

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:20.921
My godhood is nearly complete.

01:09:20.924 --> 01:09:23.258
Praise him.

01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:27.028
All hail brother Blood.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.729
Hail, hail.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.374
Yes...

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.717
I knew you'd come.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.687
Hey, papa, here's your pipe.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:04.792
Argh.

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:08.396
Save some for me.

01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:08.349
Don't you know, I am the chosen?

01:13:08.351 --> 01:13:11.986
Don't you know, I am divine...

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.434
I'm gonna kill you.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:35.042
I was being studied,
like all the rest, wasn't I?

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:38.112
You planned this right from the start.

01:13:38.114 --> 01:13:39.480
Calm down.

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:42.083
This is all
a big misunderstanding, love.

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:43.518
Terra, no.

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:59.100
Oh, shit.

01:14:03.639 --> 01:14:05.540
You heathen brats.

01:14:05.542 --> 01:14:08.042
You've destroyed my holy temple.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.545
Argh.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:16.984
You've robbed me of my destiny.

01:14:16.986 --> 01:14:18.619
You will die.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.124
You cannot harm...

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:35.837
No, you stay away from me.

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.339
You demon filth.

01:14:38.341 --> 01:14:39.774
They're not demons.

01:14:39.776 --> 01:14:41.209
Let me show you one.

01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.083
What the hell?

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:25.319
I planned so long.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:29.090
I was destined, can't you see?

01:15:29.092 --> 01:15:32.126
Please, I beseech you.

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:34.962
I am blood.

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:36.163
I...

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.202
I am...

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.740
Saved.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:49.911
I won't let them cage you, my love.

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:52.280
Come on.

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:24.278
Argh!

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.194
So long, kid.

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:57.311
Terra...

01:17:00.115 --> 01:17:01.282
I'm sorry.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:04.619
No, Terra...

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:29.644
- No...
- We have to go. The place is gonna collapse.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:30.978
Terra!

01:17:52.768 --> 01:17:56.303
So, let me ask you this, man, how
do you become a titan exactly?

01:17:56.305 --> 01:17:59.273
I mean, is there an audition?
Do you look at videos?

01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.942
'Cause I've been working
out, you know, I want in.

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:05.212
<i>Well, Kev, I guess the most
important thing to being a titan,</i>

01:18:05.214 --> 01:18:07.848
<i>is to have a strong sense of family.</i>

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:14.422
<i>Some of us don't have our own,
so, we support the ones that do.</i>

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:40.414
Of course, an outgoing personality
does hurt but, you know,

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.649
you gotta have a power.

01:18:41.651 --> 01:18:43.617
Something cool.

01:18:43.619 --> 01:18:47.254
Something cool? Listen, you turn into
animals, man, that's beyond cool.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:47.254
Thanks.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:50.925
<i>But, it's not just about
the cool super powers,</i>

01:18:50.927 --> 01:18:53.828
<i>snazzy uniforms and daring adventures.</i>

01:18:54.796 --> 01:18:56.997
It's about us helping each other grow.

01:18:56.999 --> 01:18:58.799
Be better people.

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:10.711
<i>Listen, I know you're not supposed
to talk about this, but I just gotta ask.</i>

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:13.147
<i>There's a new girl, right?</i>

01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:16.784
<i>All I can say is that she's
a wonderful addition to the team.</i>

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:20.121
<i>- Come on, Gar...
- Starfire would kill me.</i>

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:23.924
<i>There's no way Starfire is listening
to this, man, she's brushing her hair.</i>

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.698
Forget it. My lips are sealed.

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.068
Whoa, man, he just turned into
a seal, folks, I swear.

01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:37.371
But really, Gar, is she gonna,
like, replace Terra?

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.573
Terra?

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:42.476
Yeah, you know, there are lots
of stories about her.

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.145
I know.

01:19:45.313 --> 01:19:46.781
Ooh, too soon?

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:49.750
Yeah.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:51.285
I mean, that's cool honestly,
if you don't wanna...

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:53.788
But, I'd like to say something...

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:56.957
<i>There are a lot of people who've
been handed a rough life.</i>

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:59.393
<i>They never asked for it, but...</i>

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:01.562
<i>They do what they can.</i>

01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:06.000
<i>Many of them can't rise above the hurt.</i>

01:20:06.002 --> 01:20:07.401
<i>It's just too hard.</i>

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:12.873
<i>But in the end,
when the chips were down,</i>

01:20:14.476 --> 01:20:17.244
<i>and she finally showed her true self,</i>

01:20:19.047 --> 01:20:22.249
<i>Terra Markov was like a diamond.</i>

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:25.152
<i>Most beautiful thing
that I'd ever seen.</i>

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:52.092
<i>I talk to the dead.</i>

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:54.094
<i>For no matter how rotted the corpse,</i>

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:57.631
<i>there's always
a tiny wisp of life left.</i>
