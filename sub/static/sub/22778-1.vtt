01:06.395 --> 01:09.896
- <i>307 en route from Kreskie and Pine.</i>
- D4, 17.

01:09.898 --> 01:12.565
<i>307 to 309. Male, white, elderly.</i>

01:12.567 --> 01:13.632
<i>Black high-tops...</i>

01:13.634 --> 01:15.737
Whoa!

01:17.838 --> 01:19.571
Fuck!

01:21.877 --> 01:24.678
Dispatch, I got a hit and run.

01:24.680 --> 01:28.781
Blue van. Pulling on Raylene and Kreskie.

01:28.783 --> 01:30.853
<i>Dispatching officer to intercept.</i>

01:47.901 --> 01:49.835
<i>Lead him over to Washington.</i>

01:49.837 --> 01:51.836
<i>All units divert to Washington.</i>

01:53.641 --> 01:54.909
<i>All units divert to Washington.</i>

01:57.912 --> 02:00.448
<i>Eastbound, now on Washington.</i>

02:11.925 --> 02:14.493
<i>Crossing Jackson. All units
intercept at Magnolia.</i>

02:14.495 --> 02:15.963
That's good!

02:36.484 --> 02:38.751
- Out of the van, now!
- <i>Possible 10-79, bomb threat.</i>

02:40.754 --> 02:43.520
Dispatch, we need a bomb
squad here right away.

02:47.092 --> 02:48.859
Sir, wait! There could be a bomb.

02:48.861 --> 02:50.094
Fuck the bomb.

02:50.096 --> 02:51.963
Son of a bitch just ruined my car.

02:51.965 --> 02:54.065
You!

02:54.067 --> 02:55.436
Step out of the van!

02:57.436 --> 02:59.772
Hands where I can see them!

03:01.674 --> 03:03.010
On the ground now!

05:16.207 --> 05:18.640
Hi. Christi Davies.

05:18.642 --> 05:21.075
Thank you for agreeing
to do this, Detective.

05:21.077 --> 05:23.645
Well, the way the chief put it,

05:23.647 --> 05:25.880
I didn't really have much of a choice.

05:25.882 --> 05:29.753
Guess I drew the proverbial short straw.

05:33.723 --> 05:37.591
So, what exactly are
you hoping to get here?

05:37.593 --> 05:40.961
Well, with all the tension between

05:40.963 --> 05:43.331
civilians and police officers lately,

05:43.333 --> 05:45.567
my goal is to get some honest insight

05:45.569 --> 05:47.201
into what it's really
like to be a police officer

05:47.203 --> 05:49.303
in the heart of America.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.339
I'm not here to choose a side,
just be true to my subject.

05:52.341 --> 05:54.274
And I figured my hometown
was as good a place as any...

05:54.276 --> 05:55.944
All right, listen. Look.

05:55.946 --> 05:58.980
I'm sure that shit reads
great on the page. Okay?

05:58.982 --> 06:01.751
But if you want me to be open with you,
you just got to give it to me straight.

06:03.352 --> 06:05.222
I have my reasons, Detective.

06:11.026 --> 06:12.529
How'd you get your scar?

06:15.631 --> 06:17.665
Being a <i>New York Times</i>
investigative journalist

06:17.667 --> 06:20.033
isn't always just awards and accolades.

06:20.035 --> 06:23.170
Sometimes finding out the truth...

06:23.172 --> 06:24.675
leaves scars.

06:29.145 --> 06:31.311
Do you mind if I film you for
this portion of the interview?

06:31.313 --> 06:34.217
Sure.

06:44.293 --> 06:46.162
Do you like your job, Detective Ruiney?

06:49.031 --> 06:52.366
Well, it's all right. I guess.

06:52.368 --> 06:56.236
I think I used to like it more.

06:56.238 --> 06:57.940
You like yours?

07:00.142 --> 07:02.979
Yeah. I do.

07:05.013 --> 07:08.114
Place has changed a lot since I left.

07:08.116 --> 07:12.152
Yeah, a lot's changed.

07:12.154 --> 07:16.759
The place used to be all farms.
Now it's condos, development.

07:18.193 --> 07:19.661
That's America.

07:22.197 --> 07:24.667
<i>All units, 10-54,
Bancroft Elementary.</i>

07:47.422 --> 07:49.154
You first on the scene?

07:49.156 --> 07:51.158
Yeah, no one's come in or out.

08:09.377 --> 08:11.743
- Stay here.
- Can I...

08:11.745 --> 08:14.081
Sir, backup is on its way.

08:53.787 --> 08:55.855
Police! Show me your hands!

09:12.505 --> 09:14.238
Are those mannequins?

09:16.109 --> 09:19.476
What the hell are you
doing? I almost shot you.

09:19.478 --> 09:22.346
The officer you left me
with went around the back.

09:22.348 --> 09:24.114
So...

09:24.116 --> 09:27.885
I told you to stay put.

09:27.887 --> 09:30.254
Listen, your captain signed off on this

09:30.256 --> 09:33.289
and I didn't sign up for
this to sit on the sidelines.

09:33.291 --> 09:36.930
So... I'm sorry, but I'm coming in.

09:40.065 --> 09:41.166
Fine.

09:53.145 --> 09:55.014
Game of Hangman.

09:59.118 --> 10:01.887
Two dummies playing the game.

10:08.294 --> 10:10.296
925 is your badge number.

10:13.598 --> 10:16.097
I'm good with numbers.

10:16.099 --> 10:17.034
I remember yours.

10:18.402 --> 10:21.038
Who's the other number?

10:45.096 --> 10:50.332
Hmm...

10:59.544 --> 11:02.445
Yeah.

11:02.447 --> 11:04.580
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:17.494 --> 11:20.527
You know, most people go
fishing in retirement, Archer.

11:20.529 --> 11:22.631
Do they?

11:22.633 --> 11:25.466
People don't go fishing when they retire.

11:25.468 --> 11:28.369
No. What they do is

11:28.371 --> 11:30.604
they hang around waiting for their...

11:30.606 --> 11:32.540
pension checks to kick in,

11:32.542 --> 11:36.113
and then wonder, "Whatever
happened to my life?"

11:39.649 --> 11:42.617
- Still doing crosswords, huh?
- Why not?

11:42.619 --> 11:44.485
You're doing them in Latin?

11:44.487 --> 11:47.421
Well, yeah. I'm an altar boy.

11:47.423 --> 11:50.090
Way back. That's where I learned my Latin.

11:50.092 --> 11:52.560
Once an altar boy,
always an altar boy, huh?

11:52.562 --> 11:54.229
Oh, that was funny.

11:54.231 --> 11:55.530
Never thought of it that way.

11:55.532 --> 11:58.099
How have you been?

11:58.101 --> 11:59.401
- Good.
- You look prosperous.

11:59.403 --> 12:01.469
Yeah, you too, man.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.704
You're looking good.

12:02.706 --> 12:04.408
- Well...
- You working out?

12:07.476 --> 12:09.212
Am I working out?

12:19.587 --> 12:22.122
So this is it, huh?

12:22.124 --> 12:24.558
Thirty-six years working Homicide,

12:24.560 --> 12:29.063
and you end up outside a dive
bar doing crossword puzzles.

12:29.065 --> 12:31.965
That upsets you in some way?

12:31.967 --> 12:33.700
- Doesn't upset me.
- I'm very happy with it.

12:33.702 --> 12:36.603
You know, I like to watch the world.

12:36.605 --> 12:40.306
Because, uh, I never sleep.

12:40.308 --> 12:42.542
Yeah.

12:42.544 --> 12:45.311
Yeah, me neither.

12:45.313 --> 12:46.981
Yeah?

12:46.983 --> 12:49.349
You want to talk some
more about this nonsense

12:49.351 --> 12:51.453
or you want to tell me what's on your mind?

12:54.289 --> 12:57.458
There's a body over at Wayward Elementary.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.258
Female. Late 20's.

12:59.260 --> 13:01.331
Hanged with an "O" cut into her.

13:03.698 --> 13:06.466
Almost perfect circle.

13:06.468 --> 13:08.437
He took his time doing it.

13:09.704 --> 13:12.704
Displaying her. For us.

13:12.706 --> 13:15.708
For us?

13:15.710 --> 13:20.746
Both our badge numbers were
etched onto a desk at the scene.

13:20.748 --> 13:23.351
- Serious?
- You tell me.

13:26.653 --> 13:29.021
Autopsy's this morning.

13:29.023 --> 13:31.290
Why don't you come on down,

13:31.292 --> 13:34.227
take a peek at the vic, crime scene photos.

13:34.229 --> 13:36.629
See if you can figure out

13:36.631 --> 13:39.335
why this perp is calling us out.

13:43.638 --> 13:45.607
Does it remind you of anything?

13:48.075 --> 13:49.574
I don't think so. At least it...

13:49.576 --> 13:52.114
- Doesn't look familiar?
- There's a different MO.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.217
Hey. Donut shop's open.

13:58.219 --> 14:00.653
- I'm buying.
- Free donuts.

14:00.655 --> 14:02.487
You got 'em last time.

14:02.489 --> 14:04.588
That's the highlight of my day.

14:04.590 --> 14:07.091
<i>Well, you know,</i>

14:07.093 --> 14:08.559
<i>it took a bit of getting used to.</i>

14:08.561 --> 14:11.696
<i>I mean, local PD is
nothing like the FBI.</i>

14:11.698 --> 14:14.698
<i>Some of my, uh, former colleagues</i>

14:14.700 --> 14:16.768
<i>thought I was crazy
to move back here.</i>

14:16.770 --> 14:18.769
<i>A demotion in their eyes.</i>

14:18.771 --> 14:22.340
<i>But, you know, for
me it's all the same.</i>

14:22.342 --> 14:25.143
<i>Still, uh, catching bad guys.</i>

14:25.145 --> 14:26.214
<i>What brought you back?</i>

14:28.781 --> 14:32.583
<i>Personal reasons.</i>

14:32.585 --> 14:35.754
<i>Look, let's just keep
this about the job, okay?</i>

14:35.756 --> 14:40.158
<i>I'm just trying to get a
better sense of who you are.</i>

14:40.160 --> 14:43.164
<i>Audiences really connect with
personal stories of their subjects.</i>

14:44.497 --> 14:46.566
<i>Yeah, I'm sure they do.</i>

14:52.506 --> 14:54.438
- <i>There's no information.</i>
- Oh, am I bothering you?

14:54.440 --> 14:56.140
<i>I'm sorry, sir.
There's no information.</i>

14:56.142 --> 14:58.110
Well, you just let me know when finding out

14:58.112 --> 15:00.543
what happened to my wife
is a priority, asshole.

15:02.615 --> 15:04.715
Miss Davies.

15:04.717 --> 15:07.217
I trust that my detective

15:07.219 --> 15:09.353
is giving you everything you need.

15:09.355 --> 15:11.821
Oh, yeah. We're, uh, tethered at the hip.

15:13.559 --> 15:15.860
Miss Davies, I just want to remind you

15:15.862 --> 15:19.629
that the body that you saw was a person.

15:19.631 --> 15:23.200
With a family, friends, a life.

15:23.202 --> 15:26.269
So I trust that you'll
treat anything that you saw

15:26.271 --> 15:27.805
with absolute sensitivity.

15:27.807 --> 15:30.173
Definitely.

15:30.175 --> 15:32.643
And you know, the mayor may have signed off

15:32.645 --> 15:35.381
on this all access pet
project, but I didn't.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.517
If you print anything

15:39.519 --> 15:42.653
that compromises the work of
my detectives in this case,

15:42.655 --> 15:45.388
you will find yourself
standing in a court of law.

15:45.390 --> 15:47.524
Do I make myself clear?

15:47.526 --> 15:49.095
Yes.

15:50.596 --> 15:51.729
"Yes, Captain."

15:51.731 --> 15:53.330
Yes, Captain.

15:53.332 --> 15:55.331
Can you excuse us, please?

15:55.333 --> 15:57.400
Thank you.

15:57.402 --> 15:59.271
Let me talk to you about Archer.

16:04.609 --> 16:07.743
<i>Dr. Parker, please report to
pathology, room number one.</i>

16:07.745 --> 16:10.846
- Hello. Anybody home?
- <i>Dr. Parker.</i>

16:12.918 --> 16:15.585
Uh, you know, most people go fishing.

16:15.587 --> 16:18.488
Oh, you know, Ruiney tried
that joke on me earlier.

16:18.490 --> 16:22.691
- Ah, damn it.
- Didn't work then. Hi.

16:22.693 --> 16:24.826
- So good to see you.
- It's just like old times.

16:24.828 --> 16:26.764
I missed your hugs.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.666
- So...
- Oh.

16:29.668 --> 16:31.434
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

16:31.436 --> 16:34.903
Yeah, get that press pass out of my face.

16:34.905 --> 16:38.575
Last time we had paparazzi on
a case, evidence went missing.

16:38.577 --> 16:41.578
Sir, I've been nominated for a Pulitzer.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.780
- Archer.
- Yeah.

16:43.782 --> 16:44.750
You recognize her?

16:46.484 --> 16:48.287
No, I don't.

16:50.755 --> 16:52.887
Kerry Cooper, 24.

16:52.889 --> 16:56.257
Foreign language teacher. No record.

16:56.259 --> 16:59.428
Parents filed a Missing
Persons three days ago.

16:59.430 --> 17:01.896
Right...

17:01.898 --> 17:03.765
So, Abby, what do you got to say?

17:03.767 --> 17:06.568
Oh, well, cause of death
is definitely asphyxiation,

17:06.569 --> 17:09.404
which isn't at all, you know, surprising.

17:09.406 --> 17:11.239
Time of death?

17:11.241 --> 17:14.910
Well, the body was still
warm when it got to us.

17:14.912 --> 17:18.713
I'd say sometime between
10:30 and midnight.

17:18.714 --> 17:25.286
And I can tell you she was actually
still alive when this happened.

17:25.288 --> 17:27.788
You see the uneven strokes?

17:27.790 --> 17:29.460
She struggled.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.461
Any idea what was used?

17:33.463 --> 17:36.030
A large knife. A box cutter maybe?

17:36.032 --> 17:38.766
I can't be sure until I have
something to compare it to.

17:38.768 --> 17:41.436
Oh, also, it looks like

17:41.438 --> 17:43.341
the killer redressed her after the fact.

17:45.742 --> 17:47.776
Meticulous. Purposeful.

17:47.778 --> 17:49.810
Oh, and also, uh,

17:49.812 --> 17:52.813
you know, she has seen her
fair share of the inside of ER.

17:52.815 --> 17:56.750
She's had everything from a broken
pelvis to several broken ribs.

17:56.752 --> 18:00.621
They've healed, but
they're all fairly recent.

18:00.623 --> 18:03.724
What are you thinking? Like,
what, domestic violence?

18:03.726 --> 18:06.229
Uh... perhaps.

18:10.732 --> 18:13.734
What about these, uh, contusions here?

18:13.736 --> 18:15.902
Oh, uh, severe blows to the head.

18:15.904 --> 18:19.308
I mean, I can only presume that
was to knock Miss Cooper out.

18:22.912 --> 18:24.778
Okay. Thanks, Abby.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.514
Yeah, sure.

18:38.094 --> 18:40.827
Looks like she was quite the smoker.

18:40.829 --> 18:42.830
Nasty habit.

18:42.832 --> 18:46.733
So what is it you guys
are looking for exactly?

18:46.735 --> 18:51.004
Well... I'm not quite sure.

18:51.006 --> 18:53.342
We're just looking.

18:55.544 --> 18:58.477
Oh, look at this.

18:58.479 --> 19:00.415
Look what I found.

19:04.619 --> 19:05.721
Joey Truman.

19:06.921 --> 19:08.755
Her parents said

19:08.757 --> 19:11.824
she went out on a date with Joey.

19:11.826 --> 19:14.994
- Joey...
- Archer.

19:14.996 --> 19:18.434
Hey, Ruiney. Let's get an
address on this guy Joey.

19:30.845 --> 19:33.449
I think I'm gonna be sick.

20:09.717 --> 20:10.884
Joey.

20:12.553 --> 20:14.619
You think that's our guy?

20:14.621 --> 20:16.358
Oh, I don't know.

20:18.458 --> 20:22.127
You know, parents didn't give me much.

20:22.129 --> 20:24.599
They said they knew him,
but they never met him.

20:28.636 --> 20:29.771
Oh, hello.

20:42.482 --> 20:44.485
Let's get Forensics in here.

21:01.133 --> 21:05.570
- Then why the badge numbers?
- I don't know why,

21:05.572 --> 21:08.839
but it's big enough to
get me out of retirement.

21:08.841 --> 21:10.808
Help you with something?

21:10.810 --> 21:13.845
Yeah, you can.

21:13.847 --> 21:17.747
I'm looking for a fella named Joey Truman.

21:17.749 --> 21:19.817
Would he be around somewhere?

21:19.819 --> 21:23.053
What do you want with Joey?

21:23.055 --> 21:25.889
I don't want anything,
just want to talk to him.

21:25.891 --> 21:29.060
Huh. Yeah, yeah, he's inside.

21:29.062 --> 21:30.494
Knock yourself out.

21:30.496 --> 21:32.597
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- Wait here.

21:32.599 --> 21:33.766
Hey, Joey! The cops are here!

21:35.635 --> 21:38.001
Police! Don't move!

21:38.003 --> 21:39.105
Don't move!

21:44.775 --> 21:47.143
Stay down!

21:47.145 --> 21:49.044
I didn't do anything.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.649
Shut up! Stay down!

22:00.926 --> 22:02.992
Detectives!

22:02.994 --> 22:04.727
Detectives!

22:09.568 --> 22:11.201
- You all right?
- Yeah.

22:26.918 --> 22:29.688
- I'm sorry.
- Joey, what's wrong?

22:32.256 --> 22:35.092
- Joey.
- I'll explain later. I'll explain later.

22:54.579 --> 22:57.581
Hey, I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

23:18.101 --> 23:19.801
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa!

23:19.803 --> 23:22.607
Help me out, guys! Help me out!

23:36.118 --> 23:38.952
Okay, honey. Honey!

23:38.954 --> 23:40.622
- Honey, hold it, hold it...
- All right!

23:40.624 --> 23:42.390
Still prefer retirement, Archer?

23:42.392 --> 23:44.895
I never preferred retirement.

23:49.898 --> 23:51.231
Well...

23:51.233 --> 23:53.901
it looks like the abuse

23:53.903 --> 23:55.269
wasn't the only thing

23:55.271 --> 23:57.040
Kerry kept from her parents.

23:59.274 --> 24:01.742
She doesn't look worried.

24:01.744 --> 24:05.046
Yeah, she didn't even ask
why she was being brought in.

24:05.048 --> 24:07.648
Better let me do the questioning,

24:07.650 --> 24:10.183
otherwise her attorney
will have a field day.

24:10.185 --> 24:13.223
Your show, buddy. Your show.

24:16.893 --> 24:21.362
Look, I'm sorry I ran. Okay?

24:21.364 --> 24:23.096
I was scared.

24:23.098 --> 24:25.199
You didn't look scared.

24:25.201 --> 24:26.866
Right, you didn't look scared.

24:26.868 --> 24:29.036
Look, I've been doing so good.

24:29.038 --> 24:30.903
Okay? I just been clean
for a couple months,

24:30.905 --> 24:33.073
and I just slipped up.

24:33.075 --> 24:35.941
"Slipped up"? That's a bit of an
understatement, don't you think?

24:35.943 --> 24:38.745
What are you talking about?

24:38.747 --> 24:40.146
I'm talking about your girlfriend,

24:40.148 --> 24:42.150
Miss Kerry Cooper.

24:46.254 --> 24:50.323
No, no. She liked it rough sometimes.

24:50.325 --> 24:54.393
Okay? And you have it
backwards. She was the aggressor.

24:54.395 --> 24:56.962
You don't think I have my own
bumps and bruises from her?

24:56.964 --> 24:58.899
It went both ways.

24:58.901 --> 25:00.870
Well, that's comforting to hear.

25:04.173 --> 25:06.873
Look, I don't expect you to understand.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.775
I don't.

25:08.777 --> 25:10.343
I never met anybody like her.

25:10.345 --> 25:12.778
And she didn't treat me
like I was some screw-up.

25:12.780 --> 25:16.816
- Yeah.
- So I was scared I was gonna lose her.

25:16.818 --> 25:19.789
I freaked out, okay? We got into a fight...

25:23.124 --> 25:25.356
Did it get physical?

25:25.358 --> 25:28.393
Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't like that. Okay?

25:28.395 --> 25:30.395
And I apologized like crazy.

25:30.397 --> 25:32.832
And we're working things out.

25:32.834 --> 25:35.737
When was the last time you saw her?

25:37.070 --> 25:38.437
Last week.

25:38.439 --> 25:40.139
Dropped her off at the school.

25:40.141 --> 25:41.473
She said she would call,

25:41.475 --> 25:44.812
but... she just needed some time.

25:46.213 --> 25:48.080
Look, call her.

25:48.082 --> 25:50.152
You'll see. I didn't
hurt her again. I swear.

25:54.188 --> 25:55.453
So...

25:55.455 --> 25:57.789
should we ask her now?

25:57.791 --> 25:58.827
I think it's too late.

26:05.266 --> 26:07.702
This is not Kerry.

26:10.137 --> 26:12.505
That's not... That's not her.

26:12.507 --> 26:14.373
- It's what we're dealing with here.
- That's not...

26:14.375 --> 26:16.142
- No, no, no.
- That's not Kerry.

26:16.144 --> 26:17.945
What's the matter with you?

26:21.248 --> 26:22.881
I need to see her.

26:22.883 --> 26:25.182
Right now! I need to see her right now!

26:25.184 --> 26:28.119
Is she dead?

26:28.121 --> 26:30.420
Yes, she's dead.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.123
No. She's not dead.

26:33.125 --> 26:35.526
Please don't tell me that.
Please don't tell me that.

26:35.528 --> 26:39.363
That's not Kerry. That's not her!

26:39.365 --> 26:41.966
I need to see her right now!

26:41.968 --> 26:43.500
Let me see her!

26:43.502 --> 26:46.170
- That can't happen.
- Please.

26:46.172 --> 26:48.139
Please don't tell me that she's...

26:48.141 --> 26:50.208
Archer.

26:50.210 --> 26:53.044
Please tell me...

27:00.187 --> 27:02.554
Let's just, uh,

27:02.556 --> 27:03.824
take a little break here.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.091
That's not her.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.458
You want a drink?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.995
How 'bout I get you a water or a soda?

27:10.997 --> 27:12.432
I'll get you a soda.

27:25.177 --> 27:27.311
So...

27:27.313 --> 27:30.546
You still think she did it?

27:30.548 --> 27:33.950
Well, she just admitted to playing rough.

27:33.952 --> 27:35.485
But does that make her a murderer?

27:35.487 --> 27:37.254
I don't know. Who knows?

27:37.256 --> 27:39.989
You know, sometimes they
start playing and then

27:39.991 --> 27:41.490
it escalates.

27:41.492 --> 27:43.159
I've seen it.

27:43.161 --> 27:45.228
No, this doesn't track.

27:45.230 --> 27:48.165
Habitual domestic violence
is impulsive in nature.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.403
Our perp is calculated, methodical.

27:52.136 --> 27:54.537
She's not our guy.

27:54.539 --> 27:57.207
Oh, my God. Detectives!

27:57.209 --> 27:58.275
Oh, my God!

27:58.277 --> 27:59.511
Fuck!

28:37.547 --> 28:41.118
What the hell were you two thinking
leaving a soda can in the room?

28:42.150 --> 28:44.186
Especially with Lois
Lane outside your door.

28:44.188 --> 28:45.487
Have you ever heard of a paper cup?

28:45.489 --> 28:48.390
Because we have 150 of
them in the break room.

28:48.392 --> 28:50.626
Yeah, look. I'm sorry. I screwed up.

28:50.628 --> 28:52.331
Yeah, you're damn right you screwed up.

28:54.564 --> 28:57.632
Look, Ruiney. I know what you're
still going through, all right?

28:57.634 --> 29:00.369
But you have got to get
your head in the case.

29:00.371 --> 29:03.672
In this case.

29:03.674 --> 29:06.242
Or you're gonna have to
take some more time off.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.276
No, I got this. It's good. I got it.

29:09.278 --> 29:13.180
So do you have any idea,
Captain, how the girl's doing?

29:13.182 --> 29:16.117
The doctor said she was touch and
go for a while, but she's stable now.

29:16.119 --> 29:18.019
That's good.

29:18.021 --> 29:21.523
She was also able to give
an alibi, which checks out.

29:21.525 --> 29:25.428
And Ray, you're here as a courtesy.

29:27.563 --> 29:31.465
You're not a cop anymore. So don't push it.

29:31.467 --> 29:34.301
Okay, Captain.

29:34.303 --> 29:37.307
Both of you, get the hell out of
my office before I change my mind.

29:48.351 --> 29:51.686
So, Forensics found traces of human blood

29:51.688 --> 29:55.357
mixed with animal blood in Kerry's bedroom.

29:55.359 --> 29:59.494
Got a DNA hit on it, and comes up...

29:59.496 --> 30:02.664
a felon named David Green.

30:02.666 --> 30:05.399
This is the right place?

30:05.401 --> 30:08.435
I don't know, honey. Your
guess is as good as mine.

30:08.437 --> 30:11.772
I looked in the PO file
and this was the address.

30:11.774 --> 30:13.573
This place has become quite popular

30:13.575 --> 30:15.641
with ex-cons over the past year.

30:15.643 --> 30:19.112
Ex-cons finding Jesus.

30:19.114 --> 30:21.951
- I like that.
- Hallelujah.

30:38.633 --> 30:40.567
Did you hear that?

30:40.569 --> 30:43.037
Yeah.

30:43.039 --> 30:45.371
Where's it coming from?

30:45.373 --> 30:46.543
Yeah, this way.

30:57.753 --> 31:03.157
Oh, God. I can't believe
I'm back in the church again.

31:11.632 --> 31:13.098
Archer!

31:13.100 --> 31:14.367
- You okay?
- Oh, you okay?

31:14.369 --> 31:17.302
Yeah. What happened?

31:17.304 --> 31:18.838
You stop right there!

31:18.840 --> 31:21.674
Don't you move! Christi, how's Archer?

31:21.676 --> 31:23.776
- Don't move, don't move, don't move.
- Christi?

31:23.778 --> 31:26.646
- I don't know, maybe he...
- No, it's my back, my back.

31:26.648 --> 31:30.649
- Your back? Ruiney!
- I think I may have... just, just my back.

31:30.651 --> 31:33.685
- Come here.
- Dispatch, we got an officer down at Sacred Heart Mausoleum.

31:33.687 --> 31:35.655
- Suspect on foot. Over.
- What do we got here?

31:35.657 --> 31:38.191
What is that?

31:38.193 --> 31:40.529
I... I don't know.

31:47.502 --> 31:50.569
So, you see anything?

31:50.571 --> 31:55.241
I didn't get a good look
at him. It was too dark.

31:55.243 --> 31:56.876
What about you, Ruiney?

31:56.878 --> 31:59.778
No, I was too busy saving your ass.

31:59.780 --> 32:01.682
Thank you.

32:03.349 --> 32:04.385
Well...

32:06.320 --> 32:08.289
it does confirm it, doesn't it?

32:12.358 --> 32:13.625
What?

32:13.627 --> 32:16.560
Monroe's got a serial killer.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.364
Yeah.

32:19.366 --> 32:21.500
- Excuse me, sir?
- Yeah?

32:21.502 --> 32:23.734
The victim was Gene Wilson.

32:23.736 --> 32:26.738
Recent parolee who did a
three-year stint for armed robbery.

32:26.740 --> 32:30.407
Okay, get a BOLO out on David Green.

32:30.409 --> 32:33.444
- No need to, Detect...
- Hmm?

32:33.446 --> 32:36.914
Sorry, old habits. He just got here.

32:36.916 --> 32:41.252
- He's here?
- He's over there.

32:41.254 --> 32:45.624
Uh, David Green? That's you?

32:45.626 --> 32:48.760
- Yes, that's, uh...
- You're David Green?

32:48.762 --> 32:51.328
Yeah, I'm David Green.

32:51.330 --> 32:53.634
Well, that's good.

32:55.867 --> 32:59.138
"God... who gives joy".

33:01.674 --> 33:04.674
So Reverend, how does a convicted felon

33:04.676 --> 33:06.844
become a reverend?

33:06.846 --> 33:10.480
God forgives.

33:10.482 --> 33:13.384
The church? Not so much.

33:13.386 --> 33:14.884
I had to jump through a lot of hoops

33:14.886 --> 33:16.787
in order to do the Lord's work.

33:16.789 --> 33:19.757
Um, even now, I'm only
allowed to work with ex-cons

33:19.759 --> 33:22.358
trying to start over.

33:22.360 --> 33:25.496
Well, Reverend, we got a problem here.

33:25.498 --> 33:27.830
Actually, we got two problems.

33:27.832 --> 33:30.667
Two? I don't... I don't follow.

33:30.669 --> 33:33.470
You see, Reverend, there's a dead guy

33:33.472 --> 33:35.205
swinging in your church.

33:35.207 --> 33:37.407
You knew him, right? Gene Wilson?

33:37.409 --> 33:39.977
Yeah, he was the janitor.

33:39.979 --> 33:42.779
What was he doing here so late?

33:42.781 --> 33:44.781
He cleans whenever he can.

33:44.783 --> 33:49.421
He... he was just released and
was looking for a fresh start.

33:54.759 --> 33:56.261
What are you thinking?

33:58.696 --> 34:00.662
Uh...

34:02.634 --> 34:05.701
Reverend, we're gonna
need you to write down

34:05.703 --> 34:09.572
exactly your whereabouts
the last three days.

34:09.574 --> 34:11.739
Okay. Yeah, that's not a problem.

34:11.742 --> 34:14.409
Um, I was in Springfield,

34:14.411 --> 34:15.710
uh, giving a guest sermon

34:15.713 --> 34:17.980
at the Unitarian Universal Church.

34:17.982 --> 34:19.748
Um, I just got back tonight...

34:19.750 --> 34:22.384
Okay. Okay.

34:22.386 --> 34:25.454
How about Miss Kerry Cooper?

34:25.456 --> 34:27.623
How did you know her?

34:27.626 --> 34:30.592
Cooper, I don't... I
don't... I don't believe I do.

34:30.594 --> 34:33.594
- You don't know her?
- No.

34:33.597 --> 34:36.398
Well, you're gonna have
to do some explaining then

34:36.400 --> 34:37.833
because your blood

34:37.835 --> 34:40.768
was in her apartment.

34:40.771 --> 34:42.708
My blood in her... I
don't... I don't have...

34:46.710 --> 34:51.348
Y-Y-You're not
gonna believe this.

34:53.783 --> 34:58.520
Frankly, I... I... I still
don't understand it myself.

34:58.522 --> 35:01.056
But, um, a couple of months ago,

35:01.058 --> 35:03.058
I woke up in the middle of the night

35:03.060 --> 35:04.893
with someone standing over me.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.527
A man.

35:06.529 --> 35:08.696
And he... I struggled,

35:08.698 --> 35:13.067
but he put something over... over my face.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.004
And eventually, I passed out.

35:16.006 --> 35:18.408
When I woke up...

35:21.412 --> 35:24.712
...there was... there was blood coming out of
my arm. I mean, it was dripping down my arm.

35:24.714 --> 35:28.049
Like I'd gotten a shot or something. So...

35:28.051 --> 35:32.321
Okay, so you're telling us that a guy

35:32.323 --> 35:35.857
broke into your house and stole your blood?

35:35.859 --> 35:37.326
That's the story you're telling?

35:37.328 --> 35:39.361
That's... I told you...

35:39.363 --> 35:40.464
I told you you wouldn't believe me.

35:43.734 --> 35:45.634
Well, I've heard some stories.

35:45.636 --> 35:48.802
But you know, this rings a bell to me.

35:48.804 --> 35:51.771
Yeah, it's kind of a
coincidence when you think of it.

35:51.773 --> 35:54.842
Last Thursday... I
don't know if I told you.

35:54.844 --> 35:57.644
<i>I</i> woke up in
the middle of the night.

35:57.646 --> 35:59.747
And for some reason,

35:59.749 --> 36:01.418
I had a pink tutu on.

36:03.885 --> 36:06.987
And a serious fuzzy feather
sticking out of my ass.

36:08.791 --> 36:11.691
You know, you're right.

36:11.693 --> 36:13.927
I don't believe you.

36:52.834 --> 36:57.640
These days, you know, he can't bring
himself to look inside that file.

36:59.674 --> 37:03.710
But he's unable to let it go.

37:03.712 --> 37:05.715
That's why he keeps it so close.

37:08.917 --> 37:11.886
Archer, there's something that
I think you need to look at.

37:14.055 --> 37:15.788
You want me to look at that?

37:15.790 --> 37:17.392
Please.

37:21.462 --> 37:23.899
You and I both know you're not
supposed to be anywhere near here.

37:26.067 --> 37:28.437
This is important to this case.

37:29.904 --> 37:31.506
Please.

37:35.509 --> 37:39.778
At first, it just looks
like random slash marks.

37:39.780 --> 37:41.783
Oh, shit!

37:43.517 --> 37:44.986
I don't know. I think...

37:46.987 --> 37:48.622
I'm so... so sorry.

37:56.162 --> 37:57.965
I missed it.

37:59.099 --> 38:02.133
I missed it.

38:02.135 --> 38:05.907
So much was going on at the
time, you know, it was...

38:06.974 --> 38:08.543
It was all...

38:12.479 --> 38:15.083
You had no way of knowing then.

38:24.758 --> 38:28.559
You know, I introduced them to each other.

38:28.561 --> 38:32.599
She asked me to walk her down the aisle...

38:35.202 --> 38:36.703
...to give her away.

38:40.105 --> 38:42.639
I don't see how

38:42.641 --> 38:44.208
I could have missed it.

38:44.210 --> 38:47.114
You didn't even know what you
were looking for back then.

38:49.114 --> 38:50.817
You were too close to it.

38:56.890 --> 38:58.525
Okay.

39:03.897 --> 39:05.632
Good work, Christi.

39:19.612 --> 39:21.913
There are at least a dozen witnesses

39:21.915 --> 39:24.315
that can place him in
that church in Springfield.

39:24.317 --> 39:27.717
And I checked out the
report from three months ago.

39:27.719 --> 39:30.820
Turns out Reverend Green
is telling the truth.

39:30.822 --> 39:34.189
Lab found traces of
chloroform in his blood.

39:34.191 --> 39:36.593
No items were reported missing?

39:36.595 --> 39:38.562
The only thing missing was his DNA.

39:38.564 --> 39:40.196
This doesn't make any sense.

39:40.198 --> 39:41.865
No, Captain, it does.

39:41.867 --> 39:44.667
He wanted us to go to that church.

39:44.669 --> 39:47.169
This guy is definitely a psychopath.

39:47.171 --> 39:49.905
But I would classify him
as an organized killer.

39:49.907 --> 39:53.343
There's nothing random or spontaneous,
frenzied, about these attacks.

39:53.345 --> 39:56.979
They're planned. He leaves a
controlled scene for us to find.

39:56.981 --> 39:59.249
I think we're looking for
a white male, 25-to-35.

39:59.251 --> 40:01.117
Extremely high IQ.

40:01.119 --> 40:04.620
And what about this...
this pig head business?

40:04.622 --> 40:09.292
Pigs. Cops. Maybe he's
just taunting you guys.

40:09.294 --> 40:12.194
Okay, this information doesn't leave
this room. Do you understand me?

40:12.196 --> 40:14.064
- Of course.
- If the media gets a hold of this,

40:14.066 --> 40:16.198
they're gonna turn this
into a frenzy in seconds.

40:16.200 --> 40:18.905
And if I had it my way,
you would go home now.

40:21.640 --> 40:24.240
So with Reverend Green's alibi
checking out, then what does that mean?

40:24.242 --> 40:27.042
I mean, does this mean
we're back to square one?

40:27.044 --> 40:29.081
We're not even on square one.

40:32.049 --> 40:34.052
You see, it's all about the hangman game.

40:37.721 --> 40:41.023
So far, we have two homicides.

40:41.025 --> 40:44.596
But... we have three letters.

40:45.996 --> 40:47.996
Which means...

40:47.998 --> 40:51.367
we haven't even found the first victim yet.

40:51.369 --> 40:55.273
And, judging by the game board...

40:57.708 --> 40:59.907
he's gonna kill seven more people.

40:59.909 --> 41:04.012
Same pattern as previous victim.

41:04.014 --> 41:05.913
Petechial hemorrhages in the eyes,

41:05.915 --> 41:08.951
look, the ligature marks around the neck.

41:08.953 --> 41:14.155
Cause of death was asphyxiation again.

41:14.157 --> 41:16.692
Our perp's been leaving
us clues to the next vic.

41:16.694 --> 41:19.061
So far, we haven't got much to go on.

41:19.063 --> 41:21.163
Have you noticed anything
out of the ordinary?

41:21.165 --> 41:23.898
- No, nothing.
- Time of death?

41:23.900 --> 41:27.167
Uh, sometime between ten
and midnight last night.

41:27.169 --> 41:30.138
It was eleven p.m. sharp.

41:30.140 --> 41:33.908
Well, it's a little
difficult to be that precise.

41:33.910 --> 41:38.412
Well, his Rolex broke.
Right there. Eleven p.m.

41:38.414 --> 41:41.682
But clearly last night,
that watch didn't fit him.

41:41.684 --> 41:44.017
I don't know too much about Rolexes,

41:44.019 --> 41:46.789
except I do know janitors aren't
running around wearing them.

41:48.323 --> 41:50.024
That's not his watch.

41:50.026 --> 41:53.428
- Yeah. You want to dust this for prints?
- Sure.

41:53.430 --> 41:56.196
No, he's too smart for that.

41:56.198 --> 41:58.399
Tell me. Eleven p.m.,

41:58.401 --> 42:00.468
that'd fit into the time frame
for all the victims, right?

42:00.470 --> 42:03.774
Yeah. That would be correct, Detective.

42:07.042 --> 42:09.812
- What?
- Twenty-four hours.

42:13.149 --> 42:18.486
Hangman is gonna kill someone
at eleven p.m. every 24 hours.

42:18.488 --> 42:24.224
So that gives us two and a half
hours before the next victim falls.

42:24.226 --> 42:25.992
Come on, guys. What are we missing?
There's got to be something.

42:25.994 --> 42:28.461
Oh, wait. Uh, the ligature marks,

42:28.463 --> 42:31.364
they weren't like the previous victim.

42:31.366 --> 42:33.467
- Why?
- Well, okay,

42:33.469 --> 42:37.336
see, they were made of the pigskin.

42:37.338 --> 42:39.338
- Pigskin?
- Yeah.

42:39.340 --> 42:41.307
I think I can help here.

42:41.309 --> 42:46.246
The FDA stamps serial
numbers on all their meat,

42:46.248 --> 42:49.251
so in case of contamination,
they can trace it.

42:51.987 --> 42:53.420
That's it.

42:53.422 --> 42:55.724
Let's get the captain to wake up the FDA.

42:58.059 --> 42:59.795
Good stuff, Abby.

43:08.337 --> 43:10.402
- You okay?
- Yeah.

43:10.404 --> 43:13.041
I just need to talk to you
about something after this.

43:47.307 --> 43:49.343
Go that way. Stay here.

44:00.120 --> 44:01.823
Well, this is fun.

44:15.403 --> 44:17.170
Guys?

44:46.298 --> 44:47.367
Archer!

45:24.069 --> 45:25.505
Did you guys do that?!

45:31.509 --> 45:32.979
Guys!

45:35.547 --> 45:36.850
Guys!

45:39.317 --> 45:41.083
Holy...!

45:42.620 --> 45:44.556
Christi!

46:05.511 --> 46:07.611
- I saw... I saw him! I saw him, I saw him!
- You all right?

46:07.613 --> 46:09.047
I think I saw him.

46:15.119 --> 46:18.387
Yeah, because I did lock it up at night.

46:18.389 --> 46:21.356
We got rigor mortis already?

46:21.358 --> 46:24.193
Uh, no. He's actually frozen stiff.

46:24.195 --> 46:26.561
Identifying our vic is gonna take time.

46:26.563 --> 46:28.597
I'll have to warm up the
body before doing the autopsy.

46:28.599 --> 46:30.265
That could take up to a week.

46:30.267 --> 46:33.102
Wait. We don't got a week.

46:33.104 --> 46:34.403
I know.

46:34.405 --> 46:36.137
We're lucky we even have 24 hours.

46:36.139 --> 46:37.472
Eh, Will?

46:37.474 --> 46:42.413
Hey, how come the meat isn't frozen?

46:43.680 --> 46:46.349
How cold is it in here?

46:46.351 --> 46:48.416
There's a thermostat over there.

46:48.418 --> 46:50.452
It's, uh, 37 degrees.

46:50.454 --> 46:54.289
Oh, well none of that
meat's frozen in there.

46:54.291 --> 46:57.325
So how come our guy's frozen stiff?

46:57.327 --> 47:00.662
Well, he's not a-a slab of meat.

47:00.664 --> 47:04.200
And he has more water density.

47:04.202 --> 47:06.634
So, any prolonged
exposure, even at that temp,

47:06.636 --> 47:08.235
would cause him to decompose.

47:08.237 --> 47:11.005
Well, hasn't been here long, has he?

47:11.007 --> 47:15.009
How long has he been here?
This place been open all day.

47:15.011 --> 47:18.346
You know, you would think someone

47:18.348 --> 47:21.516
might have seen a stiff,
dead guy hanging in here.

47:21.518 --> 47:25.121
- Don't you think?
- I agree, yes.

47:26.256 --> 47:28.422
Now, if his body was wet,

47:28.424 --> 47:30.692
would that make him freeze faster?

47:30.694 --> 47:33.060
Yes, of course it would.

47:33.062 --> 47:34.661
Archer, what are you thinking?

47:34.663 --> 47:37.364
Well, I'm thinking...

47:37.366 --> 47:41.603
when I want my beer to chill faster,

47:41.605 --> 47:46.107
I wrap it in a wet paper towel.

47:46.109 --> 47:47.574
He was already wet before
he was brought in here.

47:47.576 --> 47:49.080
There you go.

47:51.515 --> 47:55.549
I think this boy wants
us to sweep the river.

48:02.425 --> 48:05.091
Archer, I think you should tell him.

48:05.093 --> 48:09.296
Yeah. You know how many
hundreds of families

48:09.298 --> 48:12.733
I had to tell these grotesque stories

48:12.735 --> 48:15.137
of how their loved ones died.

48:16.604 --> 48:18.675
But it was nothing like this.

48:22.177 --> 48:24.510
Okay, so, uh, can you give me a minute?

48:24.512 --> 48:25.845
Yeah, of course.

48:25.847 --> 48:27.649
- Yeah.
- Here's the photo.

48:37.793 --> 48:40.693
This is taking too long.

48:40.695 --> 48:43.696
Eight hours, 46 minutes left.

48:43.698 --> 48:45.702
Bullshit game.

48:48.537 --> 48:51.671
I know that look, Archer.
Just say what you got to say.

48:51.673 --> 48:54.643
I need to... I need to show you something.

48:56.412 --> 48:58.711
- What?
- From Jess's file.

48:58.713 --> 49:00.612
Jess's file?

49:00.614 --> 49:02.782
It's a photo.

49:02.784 --> 49:04.317
A photo from Jess's file?

49:04.319 --> 49:06.252
Archer, what the hell are you doing?

49:06.254 --> 49:08.487
Well...

49:08.489 --> 49:11.690
look, we both know she put up a fight.

49:11.692 --> 49:13.525
We missed it.

49:13.527 --> 49:14.694
Missed what?

49:14.696 --> 49:16.230
Here.

49:19.266 --> 49:23.569
There's a letter "V" carved in her chest.

49:23.571 --> 49:26.505
This was his first victim.

49:26.507 --> 49:29.509
- No, Arch, no. This is...
- What?

49:29.511 --> 49:31.511
This is a completely different MO, Archer.

49:31.513 --> 49:33.145
She wasn't hung.

49:33.147 --> 49:35.780
We didn't know the MO
at the time we found her.

49:35.782 --> 49:38.518
Archer, it's a different
MO. She wasn't hung.

49:38.520 --> 49:42.224
She wasn't hung because...

49:44.292 --> 49:48.494
he was interrupted from his ritual.

49:48.496 --> 49:51.266
He didn't get a chance to
hang her, you understand?

49:54.902 --> 49:57.169
Why don't you walk me through what happened

49:57.171 --> 50:00.341
right before you went through the door.

50:03.776 --> 50:05.245
Go ahead.

50:15.789 --> 50:19.723
Jess called me up...

50:19.725 --> 50:22.526
and told me to come home.

50:22.528 --> 50:26.564
Said we should try and work things out.

50:26.566 --> 50:31.769
So, I got home, I parked
my car in the driveway...

50:31.771 --> 50:35.240
went down the back,

50:35.242 --> 50:39.213
picked some... tulips to give her.

50:40.546 --> 50:43.747
You know, just like I used to.

50:43.749 --> 50:46.551
That would've given him a
chance to know someone was there,

50:46.553 --> 50:49.156
and that would've stopped him.

50:52.657 --> 50:55.494
Or he was still in the house
while she was in my arms.

51:19.018 --> 51:21.719
Guys, get me somebody to...

51:21.721 --> 51:22.786
Move!

51:22.788 --> 51:24.324
Whoa! Whoa!

51:39.739 --> 51:42.275
Eric Anderson.

51:53.718 --> 51:55.752
Easy, Ruiney, easy.

51:55.754 --> 51:57.352
No time, Archer.

52:01.693 --> 52:02.928
Where's that sound...

52:04.928 --> 52:05.930
...coming from?

52:10.702 --> 52:12.537
Basement.

52:45.537 --> 52:46.871
Oh, man.

52:49.606 --> 52:50.838
Look at this.

52:50.840 --> 52:53.775
This is Cooper's school.

52:53.777 --> 52:56.813
This is a replica of Monroe.

52:59.483 --> 53:01.749
I think I know now

53:01.751 --> 53:04.019
where we're gonna find our next victim.

53:04.021 --> 53:06.291
This is the Fostoria Line. Let's go.

53:16.833 --> 53:20.001
NS/Fostoria Line at Columbia and Harrison.

53:20.003 --> 53:22.539
This is an emergency. Shut that line down.

53:24.875 --> 53:27.976
He may still be alive, because
we beat this psycho's timeline.

53:27.978 --> 53:29.845
- Ruiney!
- Yes, I see it.

53:29.847 --> 53:32.517
There he is.

53:37.487 --> 53:39.589
Ruiney. Ruiney, there's nothing you can do!

53:40.958 --> 53:42.459
Ruiney! The train!

53:44.593 --> 53:48.094
He's still alive!

53:48.096 --> 53:50.663
- We need to get up there to help him!
- It's a steel cable!

53:55.738 --> 53:57.737
Come on!

53:57.739 --> 54:00.875
- Get him!
- Come on, get it off your neck!

54:00.877 --> 54:03.777
Get it off your neck! Come on!

54:03.779 --> 54:05.078
Gotta get off the track!

54:05.080 --> 54:06.881
I'm not leaving him!

54:06.883 --> 54:08.949
- Train's coming! Come on!
- I'm not leaving him!

54:08.951 --> 54:11.018
Archer!

54:11.020 --> 54:13.187
Freeze now! Freeze!

54:13.189 --> 54:15.723
- Freeze!
- Come on, you guys! We got to go!

54:15.725 --> 54:18.525
Just get it off! Get it off!

54:18.527 --> 54:20.861
- We got to go!
- I'm not leaving him!

54:20.863 --> 54:23.596
Ruiney! We got to get off that track now!

54:45.787 --> 54:48.086
- Christi!
- Christi?

54:48.088 --> 54:50.923
Guys! Are you okay?

54:50.925 --> 54:52.724
Holy shit!

54:52.726 --> 54:54.863
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

55:05.840 --> 55:07.941
What the hell were you doing?

55:07.943 --> 55:10.642
I could've saved him.

55:10.644 --> 55:12.945
He was dead before the train hit him.

55:12.947 --> 55:14.847
That is bullshit!

55:14.849 --> 55:16.950
You're the only one who
could've been saved here.

55:16.952 --> 55:19.519
That was not your call to make.
It was not your call to make!

55:19.521 --> 55:23.122
It was my call. You know,
I'll tell you what my call is.

55:23.124 --> 55:26.959
My call is... that you're chasing a ghost.

55:26.961 --> 55:29.496
You're chasing a ghost, buddy.

55:29.498 --> 55:32.133
And that will get you
killed. That's for sure.

55:34.970 --> 55:37.703
Is that what you want?

55:37.705 --> 55:39.203
Look, I don't give a fuck.

55:39.205 --> 55:40.806
That's right, don't give a fuck.

55:40.808 --> 55:42.875
Don't give a fuck about what? Your life?

55:42.877 --> 55:45.042
You don't care if you die, do you?

55:45.044 --> 55:49.080
Let's all die. Come on. That's easy.

55:49.082 --> 55:51.016
Then we don't have to
worry about Jessica anymore.

55:51.018 --> 55:52.717
Or the Hangman.

55:52.719 --> 55:55.020
Let's all die.

55:55.022 --> 55:58.290
I should've never told
you. That was a mistake.

55:58.292 --> 56:00.993
- What?
- You are cracking.

56:00.995 --> 56:02.594
- I'm cracking?
- Yes, you are.

56:02.596 --> 56:03.962
- I'm cracking?!
- That's right!

56:03.964 --> 56:05.230
- You're the one who left, okay?!
- Oh...

56:05.232 --> 56:06.831
- You left!
- I left.

56:06.833 --> 56:07.900
I stayed on the force! You left!

56:07.902 --> 56:09.935
You're rewriting history!

56:09.937 --> 56:12.036
I retired. I didn't quit!

56:12.038 --> 56:13.605
You guys, knock it off!

56:13.607 --> 56:17.909
You begged me to get back! I came back!

56:17.911 --> 56:20.177
And I've been with you ever since.

56:20.179 --> 56:22.147
And I'm glad. I am.

56:22.149 --> 56:24.148
I have no regrets here.

56:24.150 --> 56:27.622
I have no regrets about being back.

56:32.058 --> 56:34.959
Listen, Will.

56:34.961 --> 56:36.196
Listen to me.

56:39.231 --> 56:42.999
I know how much it means
to you to catch this guy.

56:43.001 --> 56:45.602
I know that.

56:45.604 --> 56:48.939
And, I feel like that myself.

56:48.941 --> 56:50.106
You understand?

56:50.108 --> 56:51.975
I loved Jessica...

56:51.977 --> 56:55.111
like she was my child.

56:55.113 --> 56:56.215
You know that.

57:00.253 --> 57:02.620
Sorry, man. I...

57:02.622 --> 57:05.256
We're gonna find this guy.
You understand what I'm saying?

57:05.258 --> 57:07.658
I messed up, man. I messed up. I'm sorry.

57:07.660 --> 57:10.697
We're gonna find him. I promise you that.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.738
Well, what have we got here?

57:24.309 --> 57:28.111
<i>Right now we're breaking into your regular
programming for this emergency report.</i>

57:28.113 --> 57:31.047
<i>We're told there's a serial
killer loose in Monroe.</i>

57:31.049 --> 57:33.315
<i>One of the most
shocking serial killers.</i>

57:33.317 --> 57:35.050
<i>Residents are living in fear,</i>

57:35.052 --> 57:37.353
<i>as another gruesome
discovery has been made.</i>

57:37.355 --> 57:40.123
<i>Police are finding
victims hung by a noose...</i>

57:40.125 --> 57:44.060
<i>There's a serial killer loose
in Monroe. Full story at eleven.</i>

57:44.062 --> 57:46.762
<i>...carved in the bodies. The public
is dubbing the killer the Hangman.</i>

57:46.764 --> 57:49.132
Let's turn that shit off.

57:49.134 --> 57:52.936
Okay. What do we got?

57:52.938 --> 57:57.407
Well, Forensics are
still scraping the tracks.

57:57.409 --> 57:59.308
You know they're not coming up with much.

57:59.310 --> 58:02.212
The lab reports came in.

58:02.214 --> 58:04.146
There's nothing on the shirt.

58:04.148 --> 58:05.348
Blood? DNA?

58:05.350 --> 58:07.416
Victim's.

58:07.418 --> 58:09.985
Well, there must be something.
Let's run some more tests.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.755
There's nothing. There's no fibers,

58:11.757 --> 58:13.726
there's no animal hair... there's nothing.

58:16.228 --> 58:17.597
Where you going?

58:19.431 --> 58:24.067
We have less than 30 minutes! Okay?

58:24.069 --> 58:26.368
Nobody goes home tonight! Keep working!

58:26.370 --> 58:28.306
Find something!

58:30.240 --> 58:33.107
I take it you didn't get any rest?

58:33.109 --> 58:34.343
No. You?

58:34.345 --> 58:37.716
I don't rest. Ever.

58:42.153 --> 58:45.153
This damn game.

58:45.155 --> 58:48.756
Every scene has a lead to the next
vic. But this one, I just can't see it.

58:48.758 --> 58:51.392
Well, I think he's just
messing with us, Ruiney.

58:51.394 --> 58:54.296
We outsmarted him at the track.

58:54.298 --> 58:58.332
You outsmarted him. Got
ahead of the timeline.

58:58.334 --> 59:01.470
Tide would have revealed that car
when it was too late to stop him.

59:01.472 --> 59:04.939
He doesn't want us to save anyone.
He wants the game to continue.

59:04.941 --> 59:07.176
Well, we got pretty close.

59:07.178 --> 59:10.278
We almost saved that guy... let's face it.

59:10.280 --> 59:12.448
Tell that to his family.

59:12.450 --> 59:15.117
Do you guys think it means anything,

59:15.119 --> 59:19.153
all the other victims were
left hanging for us to see.

59:19.155 --> 59:22.824
But this victim got taken out by the train.

59:22.826 --> 59:25.061
The Hangman wanted us to see him get hit.

59:27.029 --> 59:28.364
Train.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.300
Wait a minute. How did he know?

59:33.302 --> 59:35.202
Know what?

59:35.204 --> 59:37.804
How did he know that Eric Anderson

59:37.806 --> 59:41.141
had a model train set in his basement?

59:41.143 --> 59:43.411
I mean, there's gotta be a connection.

59:43.413 --> 59:46.012
Detective Ruiney? Forensics finally
found a finger on the tracks.

59:46.014 --> 59:47.949
They got a hit off the prints.

59:47.951 --> 59:50.050
Forty-six years old, Nathan Shine.

59:50.052 --> 59:53.920
- Nathan Shine?
- Nathan Shine.

59:53.922 --> 59:58.192
Hold it. Hold it. Did the captain
come in today?! Is the captain here?!

59:58.194 --> 59:59.460
No, sir. She's not here today.

59:59.462 --> 01:00:00.994
Who the hell's Nathan Shine?

01:00:00.996 --> 01:00:03.396
Nathan Shine is the drunk

01:00:03.398 --> 01:00:06.099
that run her off the road, crippling her.

01:00:06.101 --> 01:00:07.802
He's got her!

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.773
He's got the captain! Let's go!

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.212
How long for SWAT?

01:00:20.214 --> 01:00:22.115
Five away. Keep this perimeter locked down.

01:00:22.117 --> 01:00:23.319
No one in or out. Christi, stay here.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:27.889
Ruiney, she's still alive.

01:00:31.493 --> 01:00:33.859
Archer, stop! Stop!

01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:36.832
Trip wires. Son of a bitch
has got the place rigged.

01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:44.805
Dispatch. Ruiney. Probable 10-89. Over.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:46.843
- Grab her here.
- I got her. I got her.

01:00:51.145 --> 01:00:52.912
Oh!

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:55.115
- Get it off!
- Let's get this thing off her.

01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:56.252
Get if off!

01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:02.455
Breathe. Just breathe. That's it.

01:01:02.457 --> 01:01:05.457
- Here, breathe.
- Okay, let's get her down.

01:01:05.459 --> 01:01:09.930
He never finished carving
the letter. He's still here.

01:01:09.932 --> 01:01:12.031
Suspect's still on site.

01:01:12.033 --> 01:01:13.600
Send in backup.

01:01:13.602 --> 01:01:16.235
Be advised, there are trip wires.

01:01:55.275 --> 01:01:57.575
You in the bathroom,

01:01:57.577 --> 01:02:00.916
move out slowly with your
hands where I can see 'em.

01:02:26.439 --> 01:02:28.975
Archer, I got a deceased male!

01:02:31.343 --> 01:02:32.212
All clear.

01:02:37.584 --> 01:02:39.118
Archer! He's a cop!

01:02:46.058 --> 01:02:48.326
There! There! There!

01:02:48.328 --> 01:02:49.897
- Wait! Stop! Hold on!
- Wait! Hold on there!

01:02:52.198 --> 01:02:53.933
Son of a bitch.

01:03:00.674 --> 01:03:03.009
<i>Dispatch, we need an EMT...</i>

01:03:10.615 --> 01:03:13.483
Dispatch, we're in pursuit
of a blue Honda motorcycle

01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:16.155
heading east on Jefferson.
All units respond.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:20.994
<i>Suspect on a motorcycle.</i>

01:03:24.463 --> 01:03:26.566
<i>Ruiney in pursuit,
eastbound on Jefferson.</i>

01:04:38.535 --> 01:04:40.104
Partner, what the hell ya doin'?

01:04:43.607 --> 01:04:45.373
What are you doing, Ruiney?! Come on!

01:04:45.375 --> 01:04:47.144
Ruiney! Stop! Ruiney! Stop!

01:04:51.149 --> 01:04:53.415
- What are you doing!
- Ruiney, stop!

01:05:22.546 --> 01:05:24.312
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:05:24.314 --> 01:05:25.579
How ya holdin' up?

01:05:25.581 --> 01:05:27.782
Slight concussion, but no big deal.

01:05:27.784 --> 01:05:29.584
How are you?

01:05:29.586 --> 01:05:32.220
You know, I feel like
I've been hit by a truck.

01:05:32.222 --> 01:05:34.555
Thank you.

01:05:34.557 --> 01:05:37.624
Christi, listen, uh...

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:39.394
I've been thinking.

01:05:39.396 --> 01:05:41.262
Maybe you should walk away.

01:05:41.264 --> 01:05:44.698
Ya know? This is getting dangerous.

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.070
I just feel like we were lucky, you know?

01:05:49.305 --> 01:05:51.338
One scar's enough already.

01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:54.444
Hey, babes, we gotta move.

01:05:56.713 --> 01:05:58.445
So what are we gonna do with the captain?

01:05:58.447 --> 01:06:00.514
I mean, I think she should be questioned.

01:06:00.516 --> 01:06:02.449
She's the only one who saw the Hangman.

01:06:02.451 --> 01:06:04.150
Already did. She didn't get a look.

01:06:04.152 --> 01:06:05.819
She was jumped from behind.

01:06:05.821 --> 01:06:08.322
What a fight she put up, huh?

01:06:08.324 --> 01:06:09.822
In a wheelchair.

01:06:09.824 --> 01:06:13.826
Yeah, wheelchair, no
wheelchair, that's one tough cop.

01:06:13.828 --> 01:06:16.529
Got nothing from the
motorcycle. Stolen. No prints.

01:06:16.531 --> 01:06:18.333
Figures with this guy.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.607
How you doing, Christi?

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.245
You okay?

01:06:37.685 --> 01:06:40.920
I was doing this piece on drug cartels,

01:06:40.922 --> 01:06:44.924
and it was in the middle of nowhere, and...

01:06:44.926 --> 01:06:46.728
I was going to my car late at night.

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:51.931
And...

01:06:51.933 --> 01:06:54.269
I just felt like something
bad was gonna happen.

01:06:56.671 --> 01:06:59.437
There was this guy,

01:06:59.439 --> 01:07:02.675
and he just came up, um, behind me

01:07:02.677 --> 01:07:05.414
and he knocked me down and...

01:07:07.247 --> 01:07:09.350
he just started beating me.

01:07:10.919 --> 01:07:13.419
He had a knife to my neck.

01:07:13.421 --> 01:07:16.390
I didn't know if I was gonna live or not.

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:23.763
The detective who was
assigned to the case...

01:07:23.765 --> 01:07:27.466
Detective Michaels,

01:07:27.468 --> 01:07:30.506
he vowed to find the
guy who did this to me.

01:07:32.407 --> 01:07:33.809
I don't know why.

01:07:35.475 --> 01:07:38.146
I don't know why he cared so much.

01:07:44.218 --> 01:07:46.487
But he did. He found him. He found the guy.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:52.357
And the guy shot him.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:56.464
Detective Michaels had a wife...

01:07:59.732 --> 01:08:01.468
...and a little girl.

01:08:06.739 --> 01:08:09.773
People don't understand

01:08:09.775 --> 01:08:12.876
why you guys do what you do.

01:08:12.878 --> 01:08:15.846
They don't understand how much you give up

01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:17.817
and how much you sacrifice.

01:08:20.786 --> 01:08:24.787
So, this story,

01:08:24.790 --> 01:08:27.294
it's not about me, it's about...

01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:31.895
It's about him. It's about you.

01:08:31.898 --> 01:08:34.335
It's about you guys.

01:08:36.803 --> 01:08:39.340
So I'm not... I'm not giving up.

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:44.277
I guess you guys are stuck with me.

01:08:47.712 --> 01:08:48.978
Okay.

01:09:00.524 --> 01:09:04.827
He's killed four people in four days,

01:09:04.828 --> 01:09:06.729
one every 24 hours.

01:09:06.731 --> 01:09:09.832
He doesn't stop. That's part of the game.

01:09:09.834 --> 01:09:13.871
He kills Jessica and
he stops... for a year.

01:09:13.872 --> 01:09:17.608
You want to put a new
team on Jessica's murder?

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:19.977
Archer, we had four homicides in four days.

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:22.313
We don't have the resources
to put a team on a homicide

01:09:22.314 --> 01:09:24.747
- that happened a year ago.
- Please, it not about resources, man.

01:09:24.749 --> 01:09:26.916
Something happened. It's very obvious.

01:09:26.917 --> 01:09:29.719
- Look, I agree with you.
- There's a gap...

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.622
- I know, there's a gap.
- ...between murders. So let's just talk about it.

01:09:32.624 --> 01:09:35.826
- What does it mean?
- Okay, look.

01:09:35.828 --> 01:09:40.697
There are only three reasons
why a serial killer stops.

01:09:40.698 --> 01:09:42.700
One, they die. That hasn't happened.

01:09:42.702 --> 01:09:45.770
Two, we catch them. That hasn't happened.

01:09:46.904 --> 01:09:49.404
Or three,

01:09:49.407 --> 01:09:51.710
they're in prison on an unrelated charge.

01:09:53.711 --> 01:09:55.977
Well, sounds possible.

01:09:55.979 --> 01:09:59.816
In jail for some unrelated charge.

01:09:59.818 --> 01:10:02.651
So, why don't we get one of the techies

01:10:02.653 --> 01:10:04.653
to look at everybody who was put in prison

01:10:04.655 --> 01:10:06.388
from the time that Jess was murdered

01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:07.889
to the time Reverend
Green's blood was taken?

01:10:07.891 --> 01:10:09.692
Nine-month period.

01:10:09.694 --> 01:10:12.061
That's gonna yield
hundreds, maybe thousands.

01:10:12.063 --> 01:10:14.397
Yeah, that's the problem.
We don't have the time.

01:10:14.399 --> 01:10:17.099
So we need to figure out
a way to refine the search.

01:10:17.101 --> 01:10:20.402
But, I think that this
is personal to you guys.

01:10:20.404 --> 01:10:22.839
He put your badge numbers
on that desk for a reason.

01:10:22.841 --> 01:10:26.108
She's right. He called us out.

01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:30.480
So, let's refine the search to us.

01:10:30.482 --> 01:10:32.749
Everyone you arrested this past year,

01:10:32.751 --> 01:10:33.686
and everyone I arrested.

01:10:34.985 --> 01:10:36.622
Detectives?

01:12:25.126 --> 01:12:28.061
That son of a bitch killed Joey,

01:12:28.063 --> 01:12:30.866
as a payback to us for saving the captain.

01:12:32.235 --> 01:12:34.734
He's that kinda guy.

01:12:34.736 --> 01:12:37.670
Please, tell me you got something.

01:12:37.672 --> 01:12:40.206
I searched the records and used the
filters for the date range you gave me.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:43.542
- Yeah, and?
- 26 arrests in your time parameters.

01:12:43.544 --> 01:12:45.077
Five released in time to be your guy.

01:12:45.079 --> 01:12:46.815
- Put it up.
- That's all right.

01:12:48.883 --> 01:12:51.984
So...

01:12:51.986 --> 01:12:54.988
who might that be fits the profile?

01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:58.123
- Adam Kellerman.
- Adam Kellerman.

01:12:58.125 --> 01:12:59.992
Pull up Adam Kellerman.

01:13:03.231 --> 01:13:05.868
Yeah, here we go. Kellerman,
Adam. Assault with a deadly weapon.

01:13:08.003 --> 01:13:10.803
Look at his address. And home.

01:13:10.805 --> 01:13:12.939
Toys N More.

01:13:12.941 --> 01:13:16.643
Eric Anderson. Eric Anderson's
basement was full of toys.

01:13:16.645 --> 01:13:18.747
Give us those shots
from, uh, from Anderson.

01:13:23.884 --> 01:13:25.119
This familiar?

01:13:26.253 --> 01:13:29.087
Train set.

01:13:29.089 --> 01:13:32.126
Son of a bitch sold it to him, I'll bet.

01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.675
Let's go.

01:13:55.748 --> 01:13:57.148
Clear!

01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:58.886
It's clear, Detective!

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:10.665
Holy shit!

01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:16.067
Get Westlin down here.

01:14:16.069 --> 01:14:18.704
Get the prints off the wall.

01:14:18.706 --> 01:14:20.005
Run 'em against Kellerman.

01:14:20.007 --> 01:14:22.206
This is Ruiney.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.578
Let's get Forensics up here.
We have a deceased male.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.622
No powder residue on his face.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.563
And residue on his hands.

01:14:58.344 --> 01:15:01.748
Oh. Got his paint bucket there.

01:15:14.327 --> 01:15:17.764
Oh, look what we found.

01:15:19.931 --> 01:15:21.902
Will? Will?

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.997
I think we got the son of a bitch.

01:15:54.366 --> 01:15:57.033
You know, maybe it's
not the way we wanted it,

01:15:57.035 --> 01:15:59.005
but it's better than him...

01:16:02.107 --> 01:16:05.307
...winding up in some prison
playing cards every night

01:16:05.309 --> 01:16:07.178
to his heart's content.

01:16:08.345 --> 01:16:09.982
So it's over?

01:16:11.415 --> 01:16:13.850
Over?

01:16:13.852 --> 01:16:16.119
Yes, it could be.

01:16:16.121 --> 01:16:19.055
I think maybe

01:16:19.057 --> 01:16:21.490
I should check down at the station house

01:16:21.492 --> 01:16:24.228
and go over Kellerman's background.

01:16:28.331 --> 01:16:32.266
You know, Christi, why don't
you go on back home, honey?

01:16:32.268 --> 01:16:35.037
I think, uh, it's been a long day.

01:16:35.039 --> 01:16:37.676
I'll get an officer here to take you back.

01:16:40.977 --> 01:16:43.211
Call me if you guys find anything.

01:16:43.213 --> 01:16:45.350
Yeah, sure.

01:16:48.384 --> 01:16:51.955
Officer, make sure she gets
back to her place safely.

01:16:54.525 --> 01:16:59.161
This guy went to extreme
lengths to get our attention.

01:16:59.163 --> 01:17:02.400
Made sure we followed every
lead, found every victim.

01:17:05.035 --> 01:17:09.104
So why off yourself before
the game is finished?

01:17:09.106 --> 01:17:11.273
I mean, we don't even
know what the word is.

01:17:11.275 --> 01:17:13.408
Guys like this,

01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:16.010
like Bundy, Gacy, Ramirez,

01:17:16.012 --> 01:17:18.015
they don't just stop, Archer.

01:17:19.849 --> 01:17:21.782
So what are you saying to me?

01:17:21.784 --> 01:17:26.520
You want this thing to
make some kind of sense?

01:17:26.522 --> 01:17:29.256
Tie it up in some way?

01:17:29.258 --> 01:17:32.259
That's not the world, you know.

01:17:32.261 --> 01:17:34.795
You're still young enough to believe it is,

01:17:34.797 --> 01:17:38.232
but things like sense and logic,

01:17:38.234 --> 01:17:41.868
well, they, uh...

01:17:41.870 --> 01:17:45.807
they quit having any effect.

01:17:45.809 --> 01:17:49.009
I could never look at things from
your perspective. I never will.

01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:50.877
I'm not asking you to.

01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:53.814
Maybe you're not ready to
let this whole thing go.

01:17:53.816 --> 01:17:55.249
Because that would mean, in a way,

01:17:55.251 --> 01:17:58.756
that you're giving up on Jessica.

01:18:04.092 --> 01:18:06.162
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:18:09.164 --> 01:18:11.264
Maybe I'm not.

01:18:11.266 --> 01:18:15.268
But I need to be sure, Archer.

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:17.005
I need to be sure.

01:18:19.373 --> 01:18:24.210
That's an impossible wish, but go for it.

01:18:24.212 --> 01:18:26.913
Let's go see Christi.

01:18:26.915 --> 01:18:30.250
Listen to her recordings.
Maybe she's got something.

01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:33.452
Sure, why not?

01:18:33.454 --> 01:18:38.224
Spirit of sense and logic. I will go.

01:18:38.226 --> 01:18:41.163
<i>Did you guys do that?!</i>

01:18:42.331 --> 01:18:44.196
<i>Guys?!</i>

01:18:44.198 --> 01:18:46.366
<i>Holy sh...!</i>

01:18:46.368 --> 01:18:47.500
<i>Christi?!</i>

01:18:47.502 --> 01:18:49.102
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:51.170
<i>One scar's not enough for you.</i>

01:18:51.172 --> 01:18:52.440
<i>Guys!</i>

01:19:17.598 --> 01:19:20.368
Ahh!

01:19:23.638 --> 01:19:26.207
No, she's still not answering.

01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:38.953
Christi!

01:19:40.353 --> 01:19:41.587
Christi!

01:19:41.589 --> 01:19:43.491
Come on. Shit.

01:19:44.558 --> 01:19:47.458
Goddamn it.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:49.494
I'm gonna run a trace on her phone.

01:19:49.496 --> 01:19:51.230
Yeah. Oh...

01:19:51.232 --> 01:19:54.632
Hold it, hold it. Won't do any good.

01:19:54.634 --> 01:19:56.200
Son of a bitch.

01:19:56.202 --> 01:19:58.438
Goddamn it, I told her to walk away.

01:20:02.309 --> 01:20:04.078
Oh, fuck.

01:20:11.617 --> 01:20:13.320
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:20:16.956 --> 01:20:20.457
I know who the killer is. Call dispatch.

01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:25.064
Have them run a check on the
guy that sideswiped me last year.

01:20:37.643 --> 01:20:40.313
I wouldn't move around
too much if I were you.

01:20:46.652 --> 01:20:49.087
You know something?

01:20:49.089 --> 01:20:52.590
We have a lot more in
common than you realize.

01:20:52.592 --> 01:20:56.461
Scars... tell stories.

01:20:58.630 --> 01:21:02.466
Hmm... So, I think,

01:21:02.468 --> 01:21:06.036
seeing as you've had to
focus on me this whole time,

01:21:06.038 --> 01:21:09.139
that it's only fair that
I turn the camera on you.

01:21:09.141 --> 01:21:11.007
So come on, Christi.

01:21:11.009 --> 01:21:14.443
Let's have a little smile.
Our viewers are waiting.

01:21:14.445 --> 01:21:17.714
They're gonna track that feed,
and they're gonna come for me.

01:21:17.716 --> 01:21:19.483
Can you hear them? Can
you hear them coming?

01:21:19.485 --> 01:21:21.184
Can you?

01:21:21.186 --> 01:21:23.487
Never came for me.

01:21:23.489 --> 01:21:25.389
You think I didn't think of that?

01:21:25.391 --> 01:21:27.690
You see, the thing is...

01:21:27.692 --> 01:21:30.493
we have plenty of time
before the cops show up.

01:21:30.495 --> 01:21:33.497
But, um, unfortunately,

01:21:33.499 --> 01:21:35.732
- you don't.
- <i>He was part of the foster system.</i>

01:21:35.734 --> 01:21:38.501
- Next of kin?
- Next of kin, next of kin.

01:21:38.503 --> 01:21:41.171
Veronica Townsend was
his last foster parent.

01:21:41.173 --> 01:21:43.407
Uh-huh. How about birth parents?

01:21:43.409 --> 01:21:46.510
Birth parents, uh...
Dorothy Stewart, OD'd '97.

01:21:46.512 --> 01:21:48.412
Uh, George Stewart, '98 suicide.

01:21:48.414 --> 01:21:51.447
Oh! George Stewart...

01:21:51.449 --> 01:21:52.482
hung himself.

01:21:52.484 --> 01:21:54.451
Hung himself.

01:21:54.453 --> 01:21:57.386
I think I know where he's
gonna take her, and why.

01:21:57.388 --> 01:22:00.290
What's the date of his father's death?

01:22:00.292 --> 01:22:03.459
Wait a minute. October 9, 1998.

01:22:03.461 --> 01:22:07.062
He's celebrating the anniversary
of the death of his father.

01:22:07.064 --> 01:22:09.432
That's twenty years to the day!

01:22:09.434 --> 01:22:11.634
Holy shit.

01:22:11.636 --> 01:22:13.138
Archer, where are we going?

01:22:21.511 --> 01:22:23.344
Goddamn it! Fuckin' shit!

01:22:23.346 --> 01:22:25.848
He hung himself in front of his child.

01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:29.585
He did it at one of them pig farms off 28.

01:22:29.587 --> 01:22:32.254
Pig farm off 28? Archer,
Christi's not there.

01:22:32.256 --> 01:22:34.423
What do you mean?

01:22:34.425 --> 01:22:35.657
Those pig farms are
gone, man. They're gone.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.461
What are you saying to me?

01:22:39.463 --> 01:22:41.296
That whole place got developed.
They're condos and golf courses.

01:22:41.298 --> 01:22:42.665
You serious?

01:22:42.667 --> 01:22:44.433
- Ruiney.
- Hey, guys!

01:22:44.435 --> 01:22:45.601
Okay, we've got visual confirmation

01:22:45.603 --> 01:22:47.670
that Christi is still alive

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:50.638
from a live feed that he is
broadcasting on the Internet.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.607
Son of a bitch. You
guys got a trace on that?

01:22:52.609 --> 01:22:56.478
No time for a trace,
Captain! What are you seeing?

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.481
<i>It's hard to say. I see...</i>

01:22:58.483 --> 01:23:01.281
<i>I see marble walls.
Um, I see plaques.</i>

01:23:01.283 --> 01:23:04.285
- <i>There's lots of plaques.</i>
- Oh, my God. Ruiney, where's he buried?

01:23:04.287 --> 01:23:07.288
- Where's his father buried?
- Okay, so it's the state's responsibility

01:23:07.290 --> 01:23:09.656
to bury the destitute
in a public graveyard.

01:23:09.658 --> 01:23:11.793
So where's the closest public graveyard?

01:23:11.795 --> 01:23:14.361
Public mortuaries. We got
St. Catherine's, St. Joseph's.

01:23:14.363 --> 01:23:18.432
<i>Holy shit. Archer,
Sacred Heart Mausoleum.</i>

01:23:18.434 --> 01:23:19.700
That's it.

01:23:19.702 --> 01:23:21.369
It's coming together.

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.338
He wants us there, Ruiney.

01:23:23.340 --> 01:23:25.839
Only we got to beat his timeline.

01:23:25.841 --> 01:23:27.909
That's how he knew the Reverend Green.

01:23:27.911 --> 01:23:30.544
- How far away is SWAT?
- Approximately 20 minutes out.

01:23:30.546 --> 01:23:32.480
So please, please tell me
that you guys are closer!

01:23:32.482 --> 01:23:34.516
<i>We'll be there in seven.</i>

01:23:34.518 --> 01:23:36.687
I want all my units at that location now.

01:23:38.354 --> 01:23:40.355
Now! Go! Go! Go!

01:23:40.357 --> 01:23:43.423
Let's have a talk.

01:23:43.425 --> 01:23:45.459
Come on, Christi.

01:23:45.461 --> 01:23:49.230
You haven't figured this out yet?

01:23:49.232 --> 01:23:52.299
Why the... Why the game?
Why the hangman game?

01:23:52.301 --> 01:23:56.636
I dunno. This one just kinda stuck with me.

01:23:56.638 --> 01:24:00.873
And also, there's a slight
thrill in being in control.

01:24:00.875 --> 01:24:04.177
You know, it's an
exhilarating feeling, you know,

01:24:04.179 --> 01:24:07.580
being able to tell who lives and who dies.

01:24:07.582 --> 01:24:09.615
<i>And that justifies
killing innocent people?</i>

01:24:09.617 --> 01:24:11.952
You should really feel privileged

01:24:11.954 --> 01:24:14.488
because I'm about to give
you a double value letter.

01:24:14.490 --> 01:24:16.789
<i>Wait. Wait.</i>

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:20.260
I have more questions.

01:24:20.262 --> 01:24:23.262
Why do you redress the-the people?

01:24:23.264 --> 01:24:26.300
If you just kill them,
why do you redress them?

01:24:26.302 --> 01:24:29.836
I used to work nights
in a department store.

01:24:29.838 --> 01:24:33.373
<i>I used to dress the mannequins.</i>

01:24:33.375 --> 01:24:34.874
<i>They had to be perfect.</i>

01:24:34.876 --> 01:24:38.611
And I was in control.

01:24:38.613 --> 01:24:42.349
S-So it's all about control.

01:24:42.351 --> 01:24:44.685
And I get that. I get that.

01:24:44.687 --> 01:24:46.953
Something happened to you in your past,

01:24:46.955 --> 01:24:49.556
and you want to make it right.

01:24:49.558 --> 01:24:51.425
You think you understand?

01:24:51.427 --> 01:24:52.824
You think you understand?

01:24:52.826 --> 01:24:55.228
You don't know shit!

01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:56.929
You people don't know anything!

01:24:56.931 --> 01:25:00.332
You want to see control?!
You want to see control?!

01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:03.001
I mean, I'll flick the switch
now. I don't have to wait!

01:25:03.003 --> 01:25:05.238
Ten fifty-eight. Two minutes.

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.372
I don't need that. You want to see control?

01:25:09.009 --> 01:25:10.775
- <i>Watch...</i>
- <i>Fuck you!</i>

01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:13.011
If you're gonna kill me, just
kill me! Just do it already!

01:25:13.013 --> 01:25:16.649
Now that's the spirit.

01:25:16.651 --> 01:25:20.322
<i>Yeah. We're just waiting
for one more player.</i>

01:25:23.891 --> 01:25:25.690
Can you feel it?

01:25:25.692 --> 01:25:26.826
Huh?

01:25:26.828 --> 01:25:29.464
One minute to go.

01:25:39.841 --> 01:25:41.907
He's not coming to save you.

01:25:46.013 --> 01:25:48.815
I always thought journalists
smelled like pig shit.

01:25:51.752 --> 01:25:53.785
Your time is up.

01:25:53.787 --> 01:25:55.987
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! It's Archer!

01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:58.023
Oh, oh, Jimmy. No, no, no.

01:25:58.025 --> 01:26:02.460
Just hold it, hold it a second.

01:26:02.462 --> 01:26:04.265
It's me.

01:26:05.798 --> 01:26:09.401
Don't, Detective.

01:26:09.403 --> 01:26:13.405
Let's just talk for a
minute. You and I, Jimmy.

01:26:13.407 --> 01:26:15.874
I remember the last time I saw you.

01:26:15.876 --> 01:26:17.008
You were just up to here.

01:26:17.010 --> 01:26:18.646
Just a little boy.

01:26:20.446 --> 01:26:22.680
About five or six years old.

01:26:22.682 --> 01:26:25.386
<i>I was a cop. I was doing my job.</i>

01:26:26.886 --> 01:26:28.853
Is that your daddy?

01:26:28.855 --> 01:26:31.990
<i>When that day was over...</i>

01:26:31.992 --> 01:26:33.892
I washed my hands of you.

01:26:33.894 --> 01:26:35.326
I did. I know I did.

01:26:35.328 --> 01:26:37.795
And I know now that was a mistake.

01:26:37.797 --> 01:26:39.831
It was a tragic mistake.

01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:42.701
Jimmy, I remember those little eyes

01:26:42.703 --> 01:26:46.803
looking at me as if...

01:26:46.805 --> 01:26:48.938
I was the one who killed
your father. But I didn't.

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:50.007
I didn't do it.

01:26:50.009 --> 01:26:51.874
He hung himself.

01:26:51.876 --> 01:26:54.010
I was there, Jimmy.

01:26:54.012 --> 01:26:56.612
I was there witnessing that trauma

01:26:56.614 --> 01:26:58.081
that changed your whole life.

01:26:58.083 --> 01:27:00.084
Don't you patronize me.

01:27:00.086 --> 01:27:02.686
Oh, come on now. You don't need to do it.

01:27:02.688 --> 01:27:04.521
- I'm not gonna do anything!
- Don't you take another step!

01:27:04.523 --> 01:27:06.589
What am I gonna do to you? You tell me.

01:27:06.591 --> 01:27:08.659
I left you, Jimmy. I know.

01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:13.062
And I forgot whatever
happened to that little boy.

01:27:13.064 --> 01:27:15.132
You want to know what happened
to that little boy Jimmy?

01:27:15.134 --> 01:27:20.603
After losing my father and that house

01:27:20.605 --> 01:27:24.540
I went through years of brutal pain.

01:27:24.542 --> 01:27:27.443
Pain that you could only read about
in your stupid fuckin' police files.

01:27:27.445 --> 01:27:30.848
But you got no idea, do you? No idea.

01:27:32.885 --> 01:27:34.884
If I'd have done something,
if I had followed through,

01:27:34.886 --> 01:27:38.121
if I had inquired even about
how you were you doing, it was...

01:27:38.123 --> 01:27:41.624
- It would've been different, I'm sure...
- You know what, fuck you!

01:27:41.626 --> 01:27:43.860
<i>I've achieved heights of greatness</i>

01:27:43.862 --> 01:27:46.495
that flatfoots like you only dream of.

01:27:46.497 --> 01:27:50.499
And you know what? You know
who's to thank, Detective?

01:27:50.501 --> 01:27:54.771
You know who kept me going through
all those years of abuse and neglect?

01:27:54.773 --> 01:27:56.442
You know who that was?

01:27:58.143 --> 01:28:02.979
It's you, Detective Archer. It's you.

01:28:02.981 --> 01:28:06.783
I could've helped you. I know
that deep inside my heart.

01:28:06.785 --> 01:28:10.953
Let me take this young woman's place.

01:28:10.955 --> 01:28:12.725
Don't.

01:28:14.091 --> 01:28:16.793
I was too damn callous.

01:28:16.795 --> 01:28:18.761
I had no empathy.

01:28:18.763 --> 01:28:21.530
And that is unforgiveable.

01:28:21.532 --> 01:28:26.002
I'm not asking for forgiveness. All
I'm asking you to do for me now...

01:28:26.004 --> 01:28:28.671
let this woman go.

01:28:28.673 --> 01:28:31.207
Do you really need her when you want me?

01:28:31.209 --> 01:28:35.744
That's why this whole game
has taken place, because of me.

01:28:35.746 --> 01:28:37.814
Don't you mind-fuck me!

01:28:37.816 --> 01:28:40.114
<i>I'm not doing that
at all. Listen to me.</i>

01:28:40.116 --> 01:28:43.521
<i>Let's be fair. I'll stand
in her place right now.</i>

01:28:45.589 --> 01:28:48.923
Don't do it, Jimmy.

01:28:48.925 --> 01:28:52.461
Let's take her down and away.

01:28:52.463 --> 01:28:55.497
Should she die for what I did?

01:28:55.499 --> 01:28:58.199
- No, no, no. Jimmy, don't.
- Hey!

01:29:06.610 --> 01:29:08.513
- You got her?!
- I got her.

01:29:38.807 --> 01:29:39.939
Ahh!

01:29:57.659 --> 01:29:58.759
Ruiney!

01:29:58.761 --> 01:29:59.859
Ruiney!

01:30:01.297 --> 01:30:03.133
Archer!

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:07.867
Archer. Hey.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:10.037
Archer, hey.

01:30:10.039 --> 01:30:14.908
Hey, hang in there. Hey...

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:15.910
It's over.

01:30:15.912 --> 01:30:18.211
The game is over.

01:30:18.213 --> 01:30:20.246
Yeah, it's over. We got him.

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:22.849
I was...

01:30:22.851 --> 01:30:24.218
the "I."

01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:26.019
What?

01:30:26.021 --> 01:30:29.089
Evict...

01:30:29.091 --> 01:30:33.662
<i>Evictionem.</i>

01:30:36.730 --> 01:30:39.635
I was... the "I."

01:30:42.103 --> 01:30:45.838
No. Archer? Archer?

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.510
Archer!

01:32:07.988 --> 01:32:09.887
Honor!

01:32:09.889 --> 01:32:12.057
Ready!

01:32:12.059 --> 01:32:13.859
Port!

01:32:13.861 --> 01:32:15.095
Pull!

01:32:17.163 --> 01:32:18.632
Ready!

01:32:20.033 --> 01:32:21.999
Fire!

01:32:22.001 --> 01:32:24.738
Aim! Fire!

01:32:26.004 --> 01:32:27.437
Aim!

01:32:27.439 --> 01:32:29.873
Fire!

01:32:29.875 --> 01:32:31.611
Up and...

01:33:50.254 --> 01:33:51.856
Hey, Mister.
