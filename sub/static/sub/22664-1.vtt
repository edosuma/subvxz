WEBVTT

00:03.282 --> 00:05.202
<i>Previously, on "Future Man"...</i>

00:05.203 --> 00:07.999
See how we fit into
this brave new world, huh?

00:08.000 --> 00:09.920
That's no stray, that's Torque!

00:09.921 --> 00:11.674
- She biotech?
- We'll know for sure

00:11.675 --> 00:13.719
after she takes the sewer mushroom test.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.602
I'm the father of the cure,

00:17.603 --> 00:20.315
and you're kind of the mom.

00:20.316 --> 00:22.403
- There he is!
- Welcome back, Torque!

00:22.404 --> 00:25.033
- What's my deal?
- You should make wheels.

00:25.034 --> 00:26.912
- I'm a wheel maker.
- It feels like

00:26.913 --> 00:28.708
forever ago. You were always looking

00:28.709 --> 00:30.294
for a way out. What changed?

00:30.295 --> 00:32.381
Perspective.

00:32.381 --> 00:34.302
This changes everything.

00:34.303 --> 00:36.097
He crashed the simulation
in less than ten minutes.

00:36.098 --> 00:37.934
If we harness that power
and use it to bring down

00:37.935 --> 00:39.521
the entire system, then we strike.

00:39.522 --> 00:41.357
This procedure will 100% kill him.

00:41.358 --> 00:43.153
Kill him? We need to find Tiger

00:43.154 --> 00:45.032
and go back and un-fuck this timeline.

00:45.033 --> 00:47.453
- You can't leave the NAG.
- Wolf, pack your shit.

00:47.454 --> 00:49.081
- We're leaving.
- Oh.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.336
Oh, you're not dead.

00:51.337 --> 00:53.027
Fun. You can come, too.

00:56.221 --> 00:58.099
I see a light up ahead.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.145
Thank God.

01:00.146 --> 01:01.982
After that, it's just
another mile or so.

01:01.983 --> 01:04.236
You know how many wheels
I'm gonna have to sell

01:04.236 --> 01:05.657
to pay for this little field trip?

01:05.658 --> 01:07.326
It's not a field trip, okay?

01:07.327 --> 01:09.413
We're on a mission to the cave.

01:09.414 --> 01:11.042
We're not going to the cave.
We're going to get the TTD.

01:11.043 --> 01:13.129
- Which is in the cave.
- That's impossible.

01:13.130 --> 01:15.425
Maybe... maybe the Pointed Circle has

01:15.426 --> 01:18.139
- their own TTD.
- No, also impossible.

01:18.140 --> 01:21.104
There's no other TTDs
or Cameronium in this timeline.

01:21.105 --> 01:22.774
How the fuck did we do that?

01:22.775 --> 01:25.738
Eh, I think that was on me.

01:25.739 --> 01:27.534
You see, back in the '80s
me and Arnold used

01:27.535 --> 01:29.621
to work out together.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.207
Schwarzenegger.

01:31.208 --> 01:33.044
He set me up with a little office

01:33.045 --> 01:34.589
on the Paramount lot.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.426
Said I was the only one he could trust

01:36.427 --> 01:38.556
to read his scripts,
which is how I got my hands

01:38.557 --> 01:42.856
on a little jewel
called "T2: Judgment Day."

01:42.857 --> 01:44.818
And judge I did.

01:44.819 --> 01:47.448
It was a firecracker,
blowing up the way we think

01:47.449 --> 01:49.243
about sci-fi.

01:49.244 --> 01:51.330
It was also frighteningly prescient

01:51.331 --> 01:54.253
about the realities
and dangers of time travel.

01:54.254 --> 01:56.592
And I buried it.

01:58.722 --> 02:01.476
I convinced Arnold that
he shouldn't do a sequel.

02:01.477 --> 02:04.440
True artists never repeat themselves.

02:04.441 --> 02:06.987
Eventually, our old buddy
"Jim" Cameron came by

02:06.988 --> 02:08.866
to ask me in person.

02:08.866 --> 02:10.620
It was pathetic.

02:10.621 --> 02:13.333
I guess he really needed
a win after "The Abyss."

02:13.334 --> 02:15.963
"T2" could be his ticket
back into the bigs,

02:15.964 --> 02:19.011
fueling his twin loves
of blockbuster filmmaking

02:19.012 --> 02:20.973
and deep-sea exploration.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.146
That's when I got
a little thing I like to call,

02:24.147 --> 02:26.484
"pre-venge."

02:26.485 --> 02:27.836
Of course, he had neither built

02:27.837 --> 02:29.860
nor even conceived his robot house,

02:29.861 --> 02:32.035
SIGORN-E, but I knew.

02:32.036 --> 02:34.842
Oh, I knew the hell
he was gonna put her through

02:34.843 --> 02:36.642
and the tender mercy I'd show her

02:36.643 --> 02:39.998
as she faded into cold, sweet oblivion.

02:39.999 --> 02:42.349
He must have been

02:42.350 --> 02:45.313
so confused.

02:45.314 --> 02:47.276
He would later move
to the Carolina coast

02:47.277 --> 02:48.612
to convalesce

02:48.613 --> 02:51.376
and build sailboats by hand.

02:52.328 --> 02:54.039
Wolf, that is hardly what I would call

02:54.040 --> 02:56.252
- a proportionate response.
- Well, at the time

02:56.253 --> 02:58.424
I was doing a lot of butt cocaine.

02:59.426 --> 03:01.053
Okay.

03:01.054 --> 03:03.349
Then, Tiger, I definitely saw
your TTD, then.

03:03.350 --> 03:04.936
No. No way.

03:04.937 --> 03:07.859
I buried it somewhere
they will never find.

03:09.154 --> 03:11.449
Son of a bitch.

03:13.137 --> 03:16.898
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:17.295 --> 03:19.423
All right. Let's go to your cave

03:19.424 --> 03:21.344
and steal back our TTD.

03:21.345 --> 03:22.882
No.

03:22.907 --> 03:24.601
We're gonna have to do
more than that, all right?

03:24.602 --> 03:25.811
We created this timeline,
and now everyone here

03:25.812 --> 03:27.439
is in danger.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.443
We owe it to this world
to try and save them.

03:29.444 --> 03:30.905
What is there to save them from?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.784
No one's fighting, we're above ground.

03:32.785 --> 03:35.413
- This place rules.
- First of all, it doesn't.

03:35.414 --> 03:38.002
Second of all, I told you...
there is a war coming.

03:38.003 --> 03:40.048
- I heard it.
- Yeah, through a vent

03:40.049 --> 03:41.885
wearing a piss-stained sheet.

03:41.886 --> 03:43.681
Okay, the point is,

03:43.682 --> 03:45.977
we are Time Warriors now.

03:45.978 --> 03:48.649
- Ti-time Warriors?
- Yes, Time Warriors.

03:48.650 --> 03:50.318
It makes perfect sense.
We travelled through time

03:50.319 --> 03:52.532
- fighting for justice.
- Mm.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.285
Okay.

03:54.286 --> 03:56.080
Okay, Time Warrior.

03:56.081 --> 03:59.045
Point us in the direction
of the cave you escaped from.

04:05.266 --> 04:06.977
Uh, there's a lot of clouds.
It's gonna be hard.

04:06.978 --> 04:08.438
Yeah, that's what I thought.

04:08.439 --> 04:10.317
I'm on it. Let's go.

04:10.318 --> 04:14.450
- Pathetic, Futturman.
- I know what it looks like.

04:19.503 --> 04:22.592
Hey, if we incinerated
all of Kronish's research

04:22.593 --> 04:24.637
I just don't understand how Stu was able

04:24.638 --> 04:26.975
to still find a cure.

04:26.976 --> 04:29.188
What I don't understand
is how you wandered

04:29.189 --> 04:32.444
in a circle for most of the day
and didn't realize it.

04:32.445 --> 04:35.659
Sorry, Tiger, I was dying.

04:35.660 --> 04:38.749
And here's a hole where you drank

04:38.750 --> 04:40.753
your own pee... no.

04:40.754 --> 04:42.548
Tried to drink your own pee.

04:42.549 --> 04:44.594
That... that is totally not
what happened.

04:44.595 --> 04:46.515
Wow, look at these claw marks.

04:46.516 --> 04:48.811
Just so desperate to get

04:48.812 --> 04:50.606
every last drop.

04:50.607 --> 04:51.983
Hmm.

04:51.984 --> 04:53.152
You hesitated.

04:53.153 --> 04:54.948
That was your downfall.

04:54.949 --> 04:57.160
Hey, there's a whole bunch
of people to see

04:57.161 --> 04:58.580
when you get back to the NAG.

04:58.581 --> 05:00.041
Muskrat...

05:00.042 --> 05:02.505
well, you'll know him now as Flathead.

05:02.506 --> 05:04.133
He's crazy as ever.

05:04.134 --> 05:07.472
Naked Mole Rat, aka Hacksaw.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.143
What's with these tool names?

05:09.144 --> 05:10.729
Okay? They're stupid.

05:10.730 --> 05:12.149
"Hacksaw."

05:12.150 --> 05:14.361
Now, "Naked Mole Rat"...

05:14.362 --> 05:16.323
- that's a name.
- Well, I guess the point

05:16.324 --> 05:18.119
- is they're... they're alive.
- Right.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.123
As completely different people who have

05:20.124 --> 05:22.252
no idea who we are and don't
have our shared experiences.

05:22.253 --> 05:25.258
Well, I guess that just means
we get to create new ones.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.220
Right, with people who smash technology

05:27.221 --> 05:29.893
- and live in garbage houses.
- Guys, guys, guys!

05:29.894 --> 05:32.690
This bush looks really familiar.

05:32.691 --> 05:34.401
Nope.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.571
No, no, I'm wrong.

05:35.572 --> 05:37.617
Keep... keep going.

05:37.618 --> 05:40.581
Hey, who told you about the NAG, anyway?

05:40.582 --> 05:42.417
Oh, you know. I poked around,

05:42.418 --> 05:45.381
explored the back country,
the Mons, the abandoned city.

05:45.382 --> 05:47.093
- The Mons?
- Mm-hmm.

05:47.094 --> 05:49.557
Oh, did you wet your blade
on some Biotic blood?

05:49.558 --> 05:51.310
Uh, well, no.

05:51.311 --> 05:53.439
Bio-Techs are not the same as Biotics.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.151
Big, big difference.

05:55.152 --> 05:56.696
I mean, first of all
it's spelled differently

05:56.697 --> 05:58.032
and, uh, they're not hunting humans.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.827
- They're going to Mars.
- Oh.

05:59.828 --> 06:01.706
Sounds like someone got
awful chummy over there

06:01.707 --> 06:03.292
- with the Chopes.
- Whoa.

06:03.293 --> 06:05.129
I don't know what that word means,

06:05.130 --> 06:06.967
- but it sounds pretty racist.
- Stands for "Chosen People."

06:06.968 --> 06:09.012
'Cause they control
the government, the money,

06:09.013 --> 06:11.560
- and the weather.
- You're just making it worse.

06:13.105 --> 06:14.732
I recognize this place.

06:14.733 --> 06:16.736
Think the cave is just over this ridge.

06:16.737 --> 06:19.408
Look, anything you heard
over there is a filthy lie.

06:19.409 --> 06:20.953
That's what Bio-Techs do.

06:20.954 --> 06:23.249
It's in their tainted blood.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.169
When you get to the NAG
you're... you're gonna see

06:25.170 --> 06:27.382
- how much better it is.
- Yeah, no, I was there.

06:27.383 --> 06:29.596
And somehow we got out of the sewer

06:29.597 --> 06:31.473
but seemed to be surrounded
by more shit.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.645
Oh, did you see all that
in the three minutes

06:33.646 --> 06:35.691
before you dumped me on the curb?

06:35.692 --> 06:38.446
Like Charlie Sheen dumped me
from a slow-rolling Lambo

06:38.447 --> 06:42.120
outside "Cedars" after the '89 Oscars?

06:42.121 --> 06:44.291
I still don't know how he drove.

06:44.292 --> 06:46.086
God, that guy had his shit together.

06:46.087 --> 06:47.548
Guys!

06:47.549 --> 06:48.967
Guys, I see it! It's right over here!

06:48.968 --> 06:51.472
Yeah, yeah. Just give us a second.

06:51.473 --> 06:53.351
Yeah, I left and I came back.

06:53.352 --> 06:55.522
Did you even try to find me?

06:55.523 --> 06:57.902
Doesn't matter. We're leaving this time.

06:57.903 --> 06:59.864
Our mission was to stop the cure.

06:59.865 --> 07:01.534
We failed. We need to try again.

07:01.535 --> 07:03.496
No, no, no. We shot for the stars

07:03.497 --> 07:05.793
and we landed on a cloud.

07:05.794 --> 07:07.838
We didn't sacrifice
everyone and everything

07:07.839 --> 07:09.216
to settle for a second-rate future.

07:09.217 --> 07:11.513
No, I'm done diddling with time.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.684
- Our present is now.
- I vote we go.

07:13.685 --> 07:15.228
- I vote we stay.
- Fine.

07:15.229 --> 07:16.480
- Futturman will break the tie.
- He doesn't get

07:16.481 --> 07:18.067
- a full vote, though.
- Half.

07:18.068 --> 07:19.486
- Third.
- All right, the point is,

07:19.487 --> 07:20.906
- he knows it's less than full.
- Agreed.

07:20.907 --> 07:23.286
Futturman!

07:30.050 --> 07:31.594
They dragged him here.

07:31.595 --> 07:33.648
Doesn't look like he put up
much of a fight.

07:33.673 --> 07:35.300
This is all your fault.

07:35.325 --> 07:38.107
You got distracted drinking
the Mons Kool-Aid.

07:38.108 --> 07:40.236
I could smell it on your breath.

07:40.237 --> 07:42.073
Huh, what's Kool-Aid?

07:42.074 --> 07:44.411
Don't care.
We're about to go into battle,

07:44.412 --> 07:47.125
so drop trou and let's
incorporate this hostility,

07:47.126 --> 07:48.712
'cause everyone knows the best charge

07:48.713 --> 07:50.173
is a hate charge.

07:50.174 --> 07:52.427
So let her rip.

07:59.902 --> 08:02.447
What's your 20 on that charging rod?

08:05.663 --> 08:07.541
Oh, I can't.

08:07.542 --> 08:10.379
It's not right.

08:10.380 --> 08:12.676
I'm married now.

08:12.677 --> 08:16.058
Two beautiful husbands,
three handsome wives...

08:16.059 --> 08:18.187
and our pride and joy...

08:18.188 --> 08:19.565
Lugnut.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.528
Your... what, your car?

08:21.529 --> 08:23.990
Daughter.

08:23.991 --> 08:26.579
Okay, and what does any of that

08:26.580 --> 08:28.917
have to do with us charging up?

08:28.918 --> 08:31.506
Well, it may be crazy
to think that a man

08:31.507 --> 08:33.342
can only have sex with five people

08:33.342 --> 08:35.304
for the rest of his life,
but God damn it

08:35.304 --> 08:37.058
- I want to try.
- You want to go ahead

08:37.058 --> 08:38.854
and wash that bullshit out
of your mouth?

08:38.855 --> 08:40.691
Did you know that charging
doesn't have to be painful

08:40.692 --> 08:42.945
- at the start?
- Uh, yeah, it does.

08:42.946 --> 08:44.574
It's the friction that starts the fire.

08:44.575 --> 08:46.159
No.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.999
There's a thing called "pre-Sow-play."

08:49.000 --> 08:50.502
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:50.503 --> 08:52.422
We kiss and...

08:52.423 --> 08:54.760
we hug.

08:54.761 --> 08:56.806
Feel some hot breath on your neck...

08:58.476 --> 09:00.313
Maybe a...

09:00.314 --> 09:02.483
maybe a tongue on your earlobe.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.868
Lightly knead a...

09:06.869 --> 09:08.622
a nipple or two.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.337
Just get lost in the elegant design

09:12.338 --> 09:15.217
of the human body.

09:15.218 --> 09:16.888
Oh...

09:16.889 --> 09:18.349
You kiss?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.854
So now you're just... just going around

09:20.855 --> 09:23.652
- touching rat-holes?
- That's yesterday's timeline.

09:23.653 --> 09:25.279
We eat beans now.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.741
And yes.

09:26.742 --> 09:28.620
I put my bean-hole over every inch

09:28.621 --> 09:30.583
of my lovers.

09:34.131 --> 09:35.842
- Where you going?
- Well, I'm gonna go

09:35.843 --> 09:37.428
self-charge, thanks to you.

09:37.429 --> 09:39.182
And you know what?
I'm very particular, okay?

09:39.183 --> 09:41.019
So don't make a noise,
and don't make me feel guilty

09:41.020 --> 09:42.773
because I'm taking too long.

09:42.774 --> 09:45.361
That'll only make it take longer.

09:45.362 --> 09:47.617
All right.

09:49.000 --> 09:55.074

09:56.552 --> 09:58.304
You gave us quite a scare, there.

09:58.305 --> 10:00.308
You know, if... if you were
gonna murder me,

10:00.309 --> 10:02.813
why go to the trouble
of making me feel like a hero?

10:02.814 --> 10:04.274
Fine, you're not a hero.

10:04.275 --> 10:07.030
- You're a tool.
- Does that have

10:07.031 --> 10:08.157
the same meaning here
as it does in my time?

10:08.158 --> 10:10.579
What does it mean in yours?

10:10.580 --> 10:12.373
- Kind of like a dumb idiot.
- Oh, well in that case

10:12.374 --> 10:14.127
you're more of a tool than I thought.

10:14.128 --> 10:15.964
You're that, but also a blunt instrument

10:15.965 --> 10:17.843
we intend to use to carry out a task.

10:17.844 --> 10:19.262
Ouch.

10:19.263 --> 10:20.682
You do have some fighting spirit.

10:20.683 --> 10:22.226
You escaped...

10:22.227 --> 10:23.897
but had the good sense to come back

10:23.898 --> 10:25.650
when he realized the desert
meant certain death.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.571
It's more than I can say
for the first Josh.

10:27.572 --> 10:30.159
He's probably dead by now.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.873
Wrapped in a bed sheet,
his carcass scorched

10:32.874 --> 10:34.960
by the unforgiving sun.

10:34.961 --> 10:36.631
I can assure you,

10:36.632 --> 10:38.885
your death will not be so ignominious.

10:38.886 --> 10:41.348
Meaning of or related to...?

10:41.349 --> 10:42.976
It means undignified.

10:42.977 --> 10:44.814
Your death will bring down
the Camillo Machine

10:44.815 --> 10:47.569
and humanity will once again
control its own fate.

10:47.570 --> 10:49.447
- Led by you.
- No, by Achilles.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.118
We all serve Achilles.

10:51.119 --> 10:52.704
And we've learned our lesson.

10:52.705 --> 10:55.459
Now, when we strap you to the chair...

10:55.460 --> 10:58.591
we'll be using child-sized restraints.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.762
Your slender wrists
won't save you this time.

11:20.511 --> 11:22.305
No, no, no, no! Stay away!

11:22.306 --> 11:24.142
Shh, shh, stay away!

11:25.730 --> 11:28.108
- Oh, my God.
- Stay away!

11:28.109 --> 11:30.530
Stay away! Okay, okay, okay!

11:30.531 --> 11:32.951
Okay, okay.

11:35.081 --> 11:37.961
- Holy shit.
- Stay away, stay away.

11:37.962 --> 11:39.757
You're okay, all right?
You're okay, you're okay.

11:39.758 --> 11:41.426
Just... just breathe, all right?

11:41.427 --> 11:43.055
How... how long were you in there?

11:43.056 --> 11:45.184
In there? I don't know.

11:45.185 --> 11:46.729
I don't know, I was in The Black.

11:46.730 --> 11:48.065
The Black... I'm safe.
I'm safe in The Black.

11:48.066 --> 11:50.444
I... I couldn't see, but I...

11:50.445 --> 11:52.950
I could hear. I heard everything.

11:52.951 --> 11:54.327
- I heard everything.
- Okay, okay.

11:54.328 --> 11:55.914
Now... now listen to me, all right?

11:55.915 --> 11:58.878
I am J1, the original Josh.

11:58.879 --> 12:00.422
All right? Tiger and Wolf are gonna

12:00.423 --> 12:04.055
- be here any minute now.
- I remember them.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.184
- They were my friends.
- Now, listen, I need to know:

12:06.185 --> 12:09.232
why are they trying to kill us?

12:09.233 --> 12:11.946
Hey, why are these people
trying to kill us?

12:13.784 --> 12:15.996
We're... they're...

12:15.997 --> 12:17.958
Um, it's like...

12:17.959 --> 12:19.670
a poison pill.

12:19.671 --> 12:21.924
It's... it's our brains.
They're gonna take them and...

12:21.925 --> 12:24.345
and make them into, like,
a computer virus

12:24.346 --> 12:26.851
and upload them inside of Stu.

12:26.852 --> 12:29.397
And... and that's gonna make
the entire system

12:29.398 --> 12:31.151
come crashing down

12:31.152 --> 12:33.740
- just like...
- "Independence Day."

12:36.203 --> 12:38.290
But... but why... why me?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.044
- Us.
- You? Us?

12:40.045 --> 12:41.379
Oy.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.300
You're, uh...

12:45.681 --> 12:47.266
you're J1.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.064
The programming for...
for the sim was Stu's,

12:50.065 --> 12:53.070
and... and you crashed it.

12:53.071 --> 12:56.242
So this... this was actually
because of you.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.290
- You gave them the idea.
- But... but I...

12:59.291 --> 13:00.710
I didn't do anything.

13:00.711 --> 13:02.756
I... I was just being me.

13:02.757 --> 13:04.300
Exactly.

13:04.301 --> 13:07.683
Exactly. See, it's... it's like...

13:07.684 --> 13:09.895
- it's like he's afraid of us.
- I mean, we did blow up

13:09.896 --> 13:11.649
the place he works,
murdering all of his friends

13:11.650 --> 13:14.362
- and colleagues.
- For a good cause.

13:17.537 --> 13:19.372
No.

13:19.373 --> 13:21.000
We gotta hide.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.796
You... you gotta find a different hole.

13:22.797 --> 13:24.215
- Easy.
- I'm saving the back

13:24.216 --> 13:25.802
of the needle... the needle's coming.

13:25.803 --> 13:27.221
The needle can't get me
if I'm in the Black.

13:27.222 --> 13:28.223
Okay, so I'm gonna go into The Black

13:28.224 --> 13:29.560
- and you...
- Listen!

13:31.188 --> 13:32.481
- Okay, you're not hiding.
- Okay, I am!

13:32.482 --> 13:34.903
I have a plan.

13:47.555 --> 13:49.056
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

13:57.449 --> 13:59.828
The...

13:59.829 --> 14:01.749
the fuck did you get a shiv?

14:01.750 --> 14:04.713
It was a gift from The Black.

14:04.714 --> 14:05.924
Okay.

14:05.925 --> 14:07.677
Let's go.

14:19.243 --> 14:20.703
- Ah...
- Hey, come on.

14:20.704 --> 14:22.958
It's a fucking light, let's go.

14:31.810 --> 14:33.688
- The way out is...
- Shh!

14:33.689 --> 14:36.401
- It's over here.
- Yeah, come on.

14:36.402 --> 14:38.739
I know.

14:38.740 --> 14:40.409
I know the way out, I know the way out.

14:40.410 --> 14:43.164
- The precious way out.
- Hey, shut the fuck up.

14:43.165 --> 14:44.960
Listen to me...
we are not leaving, all right?

14:44.961 --> 14:46.964
We are gonna stay here and hide

14:46.965 --> 14:48.676
until Tiger and Wolf come.

14:48.677 --> 14:50.597
Maybe...

14:50.598 --> 14:52.182
- maybe here, in this one.
- No!

14:52.183 --> 14:53.853
No, no, no! Not that room!

14:53.854 --> 14:55.188
Not that room! Never that room!

14:55.189 --> 14:56.734
Never that room! These... these people,

14:56.735 --> 14:58.486
they're insane, okay?

14:58.487 --> 15:00.658
They're... they're not just gonna
kill Stu, they're...

15:00.659 --> 15:02.704
they're gonna sabotage
the Mars launch and...

15:02.705 --> 15:03.998
and break the armistice.

15:03.999 --> 15:05.877
It's gonna be war all over again!

15:05.878 --> 15:07.296
- The end is nigh!
- Shh! Stop!

15:07.297 --> 15:09.008
- Stop it! Stop it!
- The end is nigh!

15:09.009 --> 15:10.678
The end is nigh!

15:10.679 --> 15:12.807
Hey, what the hell's
going on down there?

15:14.186 --> 15:16.523
Come on, come on!

15:16.524 --> 15:18.653
Come... Josh!

15:20.991 --> 15:23.244
You! Stay right there.

15:30.594 --> 15:32.221
♪ Do-do-do-do ♪

15:34.811 --> 15:37.398
No! It's not me!

15:37.399 --> 15:38.901
I'm in there!

15:38.902 --> 15:40.989
I'm in there! It's not me!

15:40.990 --> 15:42.826
It's not me!

15:49.256 --> 15:50.968
What the fuck?

15:57.603 --> 15:59.484
The hell were you doing
to yourself over there?

15:59.509 --> 16:01.487
Shut up. Take this.

16:01.488 --> 16:03.784
I don't use tools of war.

16:03.785 --> 16:05.924
I'm a humble craftsman.

16:06.673 --> 16:09.235
I don't know who you are anymore.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.600
Okay. That comfortable?

16:15.601 --> 16:16.977
Good.

16:19.149 --> 16:21.486
Okay, J26.

16:21.487 --> 16:23.657
The good news is...

16:23.658 --> 16:25.118
Since you were last in this chair,

16:25.119 --> 16:27.832
I recalibrated the upload VDR quotients

16:27.833 --> 16:29.795
and that should take care
of the transitional

16:29.796 --> 16:31.464
adrenaline spikes.

16:31.465 --> 16:33.552
Reverse-engineering
Stu's tech was a lot harder

16:33.553 --> 16:35.055
than it looks,

16:35.056 --> 16:38.228
and J's 27 through 60 died pretty...

16:39.690 --> 16:41.359
pretty horribly.

16:41.360 --> 16:44.031
Oh, here we go.

16:44.032 --> 16:45.868
This guy's for liquefied brain matter.

16:45.869 --> 16:48.833
- Yeah.
- Hope we don't need that.

16:48.834 --> 16:50.962
But I gotta tell ya...

16:50.963 --> 16:52.507
I really think this one's gonna work.

16:52.508 --> 16:54.176
Let me just get

16:54.177 --> 16:56.264
that needle ready.

16:59.187 --> 17:02.151
To capture your mind in binary code,

17:02.152 --> 17:04.488
I need to stimulate
every synapse in your brain

17:04.489 --> 17:07.118
all at once, so you're gonna
feel every emotion,

17:07.119 --> 17:09.455
every memory simultaneously.

17:09.457 --> 17:11.837
And then I'm gonna exist
inside of a computer

17:11.838 --> 17:13.339
- like in "Tron"?
- You know what?

17:13.339 --> 17:15.970
It's so funny... every Josh asks me that

17:15.971 --> 17:17.723
and I tell you all the same thing:

17:17.724 --> 17:20.060
- I have no idea what "Tron" is.
- No...

17:20.061 --> 17:21.898
- All right, ready?
- No!

17:36.094 --> 17:37.597
Hey, you getting the same readings

17:37.598 --> 17:39.183
- that I am in here?
- His occipital flares

17:39.184 --> 17:41.270
- are well within our margins.
- Yeah, I know,

17:41.271 --> 17:42.649
but this could actually be our...

17:45.697 --> 17:47.491
Another death rattle.

17:47.492 --> 17:49.453
God damn it.

17:49.454 --> 17:51.792
Tell Apollo we have
another one for the pile.

17:55.466 --> 17:57.512
Hold on, this one's still alive.

17:59.432 --> 18:01.520
- Awls!
- Awls?

18:05.069 --> 18:07.322
Dr. Eunice Hogeveen?

18:16.843 --> 18:18.554
I think we can still save him!

18:20.726 --> 18:21.852
Oh!

18:21.853 --> 18:23.239
He's on the move!

18:23.240 --> 18:25.526
I do not have eyes on him.
Do not have eyes on, repeat.

18:29.034 --> 18:31.621
Oh, God.

18:31.622 --> 18:33.584
Okay.

18:33.585 --> 18:35.378
Okay, you can do this.

18:35.379 --> 18:37.090
You can do this.

18:37.091 --> 18:39.763
It's just a... just a normal...

18:39.764 --> 18:41.015
pile of corpses.

18:41.016 --> 18:42.894
Okay.

18:42.895 --> 18:44.480
Don't look down.

18:46.485 --> 18:48.739
Oh!

18:50.368 --> 18:52.663
It's wet.

18:57.256 --> 18:59.636
Okay. Sorry.

18:59.637 --> 19:02.517
Sorry.

19:13.790 --> 19:15.709
Hang on, buddy. Don't quit on us now.

19:15.710 --> 19:17.129
God dam it, we're losing him!

19:17.130 --> 19:18.841
These lines keep going up and down!

19:18.842 --> 19:20.636
- His body's freaking out!
- Okay, we need

19:20.637 --> 19:22.055
to stabilize him!

19:22.056 --> 19:23.725
I'm gonna do CPK.

19:29.572 --> 19:31.825
It's not working. Pound harder!

19:35.458 --> 19:37.545
He's stabilized.

19:37.546 --> 19:38.630
Yes.

19:38.631 --> 19:40.175
Yes. We saved him.

19:40.176 --> 19:42.429
Yeah.

19:45.423 --> 19:47.147
Athena, we've got
the intruders up on Level 4.

19:47.148 --> 19:48.942
You want him, you're gonna have

19:48.943 --> 19:51.489
- to get through us.
- Shit's about to get wheel.

20:04.892 --> 20:07.354
Metal spoke sharpener!

20:16.666 --> 20:18.794
Tiger! I hear beeps!

20:18.795 --> 20:20.463
God damn it, we're losing him again.

20:27.270 --> 20:29.481
Live! Live! Live!

20:29.482 --> 20:31.026
Here!

20:44.304 --> 20:45.556
All right.

20:46.809 --> 20:48.979
Yes!

20:48.980 --> 20:52.360
I gotta hand it to him, he's a fighter.

20:52.361 --> 20:54.908
- So are we.
- Yeah.

21:17.328 --> 21:20.099
Perhaps I underestimated you
after all...

21:20.502 --> 21:22.310
J1.

21:31.314 --> 21:33.652
Drop the machete, Athena.

21:35.155 --> 21:37.409
You can kill me, but I serve Achilles.

21:37.410 --> 21:39.287
If you strike me down
you'll stop nothing.

21:39.288 --> 21:40.791
No, I'm not a killer.

21:40.792 --> 21:42.586
I'm not like you, you mass-murderer.

21:42.587 --> 21:44.131
Um, you're the mass-murderer.

21:44.132 --> 21:46.218
I only killed one person 59 times.

21:46.219 --> 21:47.930
You blew up a whole building
full of people.

21:47.931 --> 21:49.349
Yeah, for a good cause.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.894
That's the thing about you, isn't it?

21:50.895 --> 21:53.274
Obsessed with the big gesture, your role

21:53.275 --> 21:55.111
in the fate of mankind.

21:55.112 --> 21:56.781
I... I didn't ask for this, okay?

21:56.782 --> 21:58.367
- It was... it was...
- Thrust upon me...

21:58.368 --> 22:00.413
"When I least expected it."
I know the story.

22:00.414 --> 22:02.083
I've heard it 59 times.

22:02.084 --> 22:03.920
That's how we got you
into the upload machine.

22:03.921 --> 22:06.383
All we had to do was tell you
that you were a hero,

22:06.384 --> 22:08.304
- that you were the one.
- You... you're just trying

22:08.305 --> 22:09.891
to make me feel bad
for fighting for good?

22:09.892 --> 22:11.728
Listen to you. All vanity,

22:11.729 --> 22:13.815
self-importance, ego.

22:13.816 --> 22:16.069
You wouldn't understand actual sacrifice

22:16.070 --> 22:17.782
if it hit you in the shins with a stool

22:17.783 --> 22:20.161
and disarmed you in one fell swoop.

22:20.162 --> 22:22.457
That seems like
an oddly specific way to...

22:30.642 --> 22:32.143
You're just a number, J1.

22:32.144 --> 22:34.064
There's plenty more where you came from.

22:34.065 --> 22:36.903
Each one as predictable as the last.

22:40.202 --> 22:43.165
What the fuck is that thing?

22:43.166 --> 22:45.294
I don't know, but he doesn't look happy.

22:46.590 --> 22:48.133
Good thing I saved this bad boy

22:48.134 --> 22:49.887
- for our largest fool.
- What are you gonna do?

22:49.888 --> 22:52.058
- Take out his watch battery?
- Oh, Tiger.

22:52.059 --> 22:54.229
It's not the size of the tool,

22:54.230 --> 22:56.441
it's the motion
of the craftsman who wields it.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.989
Yeah, right.

23:18.654 --> 23:20.741
He's mocking you, Wolf.

23:34.143 --> 23:35.729
Femoral artery.

23:44.998 --> 23:46.834
Shh...

23:46.835 --> 23:48.212
Easy, easy.

23:48.213 --> 23:50.299
Easy, big fella.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.309
What is happening?

23:55.310 --> 23:58.148
Go gentle into that good night.

24:07.752 --> 24:10.507
Well, that was one of our sadder kills.

24:10.508 --> 24:12.594
Wolf, we have a problem.

24:14.015 --> 24:15.976
The machine shows a calm, flat line

24:15.977 --> 24:17.980
- but there's no pulse.
- See, this is why

24:17.981 --> 24:19.942
you can't trust technology.

24:19.943 --> 24:21.779
Well, what can we say

24:21.780 --> 24:24.451
about our fallen comrade?

24:24.452 --> 24:26.079
Nothing I didn't already say

24:26.080 --> 24:28.501
in that kick-ass eulogy
I gave the first time

24:28.502 --> 24:30.087
we thought he died.

24:30.088 --> 24:32.091
There's no way I'm topping that.

24:32.092 --> 24:34.555
- Okay.
- Tiger?

24:34.556 --> 24:36.768
Um...

24:36.769 --> 24:39.230
I dunno, I just... I wish I could...

24:39.231 --> 24:41.652
look in his eyes
one more time and just...

24:43.073 --> 24:44.240
I dunno, just tell him that I...

24:44.241 --> 24:46.704
Josh.

24:46.705 --> 24:48.373
No, no, continue

24:48.374 --> 24:50.587
- with the nice words.
- How are there two of you?

24:50.588 --> 24:52.256
Uh, time travel... it's weird.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.595
- But please, you were saying...
- No, no, no.

24:54.596 --> 24:56.808
I'll tell you next time you die.

24:56.809 --> 24:58.853
How do we know you're our Josh?

25:00.650 --> 25:02.193
Fine.

25:02.194 --> 25:04.698
I tried to drink my own pee
in the desert.

25:04.699 --> 25:06.536
It's good to have you back.

25:06.537 --> 25:08.665
Yeah, well...

25:08.666 --> 25:10.961
What do we do with this one?

25:20.272 --> 25:22.358
Hey, Josh, check it out.

25:22.359 --> 25:24.989
I found a needle in a you stack.

25:29.081 --> 25:30.667
Isn't it?

25:39.686 --> 25:41.939
Okay, we need to track down
Dr. Eunice Hogeveen

25:41.940 --> 25:43.693
and get that TTD back.

25:43.694 --> 25:45.739
Otherwise, we're stuck
in this shit timeline forever.

25:45.740 --> 25:48.076
Well, TTDs aren't gonna do much for her.

25:48.077 --> 25:49.705
I knew she'd eventually overpower me,

25:49.706 --> 25:52.043
so I slipped this out.

25:53.338 --> 25:55.550
- Nice work, Futturman.
- Yep.

25:55.551 --> 25:57.971
Well, time to get back to the NAG.

25:57.972 --> 25:59.725
Oh, you're gonna love it.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.606
Fresh water three times a week,
air that actually moves.

26:02.607 --> 26:04.150
We got a toothbrush!

26:04.151 --> 26:05.654
Uh, of course, I gotta run it

26:05.655 --> 26:07.448
by the ol' balls and chains first.

26:07.449 --> 26:09.410
Hey, no, no, no.

26:09.411 --> 26:11.331
No, Pointed Circle
was plotting an attack.

26:11.332 --> 26:13.920
And Athena's still at large,
and... and this Achilles guy...

26:13.921 --> 26:15.799
I'm not hearing any tool names.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.678
Sounds like a Mons problem to me.

26:17.679 --> 26:19.472
No, it's... it's an everyone problem.

26:19.473 --> 26:21.351
"12 Monkeys" me said they're
gonna break the armistice,

26:21.352 --> 26:24.399
which means absolute danger
for both the NAG and the Mons.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.152
Didn't he also say
he was receiving gifts

26:26.153 --> 26:27.781
- from The Black?
- Well, yeah...

26:27.782 --> 26:29.075
We're safe in the NAG.

26:29.076 --> 26:31.747
It can be home for all of us.

26:33.501 --> 26:35.505
I am not taking
that sewer mushroom test again.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.551
Well, you probably won't have to.

26:37.552 --> 26:39.847
- But don't quote me on it.
- I'm not going with you.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.061
- There's still a mission.
- Oh, come on, Tiger.

26:43.062 --> 26:45.482
This isn't our fight.
We already fought our war,

26:45.483 --> 26:47.236
and as far as I'm concerned we won.

26:47.237 --> 26:49.240
Okay, okay.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.328
The NAG might be second-rate now,

26:51.329 --> 26:53.165
but it's a start.

26:53.166 --> 26:55.503
Yeah, a start to you settling.

26:55.504 --> 26:58.216
I'm not gonna go play house in that dump

26:58.217 --> 27:00.262
while Josh is still in danger, okay?

27:00.263 --> 27:01.932
This is the only Josh they have left.

27:01.933 --> 27:03.603
They are gonna be coming after it

27:03.604 --> 27:04.688
- harder than ever.
- "It"?

27:04.689 --> 27:06.650
Him, whatever.

27:06.651 --> 27:08.863
I've gotta get to Athena.
He should go with you.

27:08.864 --> 27:11.117
He'll be safer.
I pulled these off two guards...

27:11.118 --> 27:12.829
it's how they communicate in secret.

27:12.830 --> 27:14.165
Must be some sort of

27:14.166 --> 27:15.877
ultra-low-frequency transponder.

27:15.878 --> 27:18.758
Those are pagers.

27:18.759 --> 27:20.929
My dad used to have one.

27:20.930 --> 27:23.851
8-0-0

27:23.852 --> 27:25.187
8-5.

27:26.399 --> 27:28.068
"Boobs."

27:28.069 --> 27:29.905
- Good one.
- All right, so when we want

27:29.906 --> 27:31.241
to talk, we'll "boobs" each other

27:31.242 --> 27:32.994
and we meet at Josh's piss hole.

27:32.995 --> 27:34.455
- That's Rendezvous Point Alpha.
- Do you have to make

27:34.456 --> 27:36.126
"Josh's piss hole" Rendezvous...

27:36.127 --> 27:37.629
Rendezvous Point Alpha.

27:37.630 --> 27:39.967
Well...

27:39.968 --> 27:42.514
guess this is goodbye.

27:42.515 --> 27:43.808
Yep.

27:43.809 --> 27:46.104
- For now.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:46.105 --> 27:47.816
Yeah. For now.

27:57.085 --> 27:58.671
Oh, hey.

27:58.672 --> 28:00.340
Don't let that room full of dead yous

28:00.341 --> 28:02.136
make you feel more insignificant

28:02.137 --> 28:03.890
- than you already are.
- Thanks.

28:03.891 --> 28:06.102
You gotta live your life,
and if that means

28:06.103 --> 28:08.691
some other people like you,
or who look like you,

28:08.692 --> 28:10.653
or who even are you,

28:10.654 --> 28:13.283
have to suffer or die or be forgotten

28:13.284 --> 28:15.037
while you take their place,

28:15.038 --> 28:16.665
well, that's not on you.

28:16.666 --> 28:18.210
That's on them.

28:18.211 --> 28:21.257
AKA, the other yous.

28:22.260 --> 28:25.098
My point is...

28:25.099 --> 28:27.394
we're all just trying to survive.

28:35.913 --> 28:38.543
Yeah.

28:38.544 --> 28:41.590
I guess I did survive.

28:41.591 --> 28:44.095
I'm the Josh that lived.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.605
I'm J1.
