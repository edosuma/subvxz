that I was doing last night--

35:26.758 --> 35:29.626
I discovered that there are
some native nations

35:29.628 --> 35:30.894

35:30.896 --> 35:33.530
that have a demon
called a skinwalker.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.134

35:49.681 --> 35:52.315

to Brianna.

35:53.852 --> 35:57.154

in these ancient myths.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.255

35:58.257 --> 35:59.623
there's a lot more
than some truth.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.075
- According to the myth,

36:01.076 --> 36:02.526
the skinwalkers were locked
within the Earth,

36:02.528 --> 36:04.694
and only a great earthquake
could set them free

36:04.696 --> 36:05.929
