00:13.594 --> 00:17.623
I am not an Fdic-insured bank.

01:03.598 --> 01:05.084
Wow, Bart!

01:05.084 --> 01:06.783
Lookin' good!

01:07.386 --> 01:09.428
Well, I have to look
good for tomorrow.

01:09.429 --> 01:10.274
Right...

01:10.531 --> 01:11.941
tomorrow.

01:11.965 --> 01:14.766
Homer, you do know
what tomorrow is.

01:14.767 --> 01:15.727
Think. Think.

01:15.794 --> 01:17.354
I'm not thinking. You think.

01:17.355 --> 01:19.020
You have to think,
it's your job!

01:19.022 --> 01:20.749
You have to think,
it's your job.

01:20.744 --> 01:22.019
Why you little...

01:25.186 --> 01:26.184
Homer!

01:26.189 --> 01:27.820
Lisa is receiving

01:27.827 --> 01:29.421
the Student of
the Millennium

01:29.425 --> 01:30.721
Award at school.

01:30.725 --> 01:32.263
To be fair,
the millennium

01:32.276 --> 01:33.971
just started,
so it's not

01:33.978 --> 01:35.580
that big a deal.

01:35.586 --> 01:37.292
But they're giving it to me.

01:38.257 --> 01:39.912
You have to be there.

01:39.915 --> 01:41.542
You miss way too
many precious

01:41.548 --> 01:43.211
moments in
the childrens' lives.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.413
What?! Name 12.

01:45.427 --> 01:46.571
Well, just this week,

01:46.575 --> 01:47.653
there's been field day,

01:47.655 --> 01:48.893
picking me up from
the airport...

01:48.905 --> 01:50.791
And the Father-Daughter Dance.

01:52.815 --> 01:54.780
Lisa, if you like,
I'm certified

01:54.788 --> 01:57.153
to conduct a mock father
daughter conversation.

01:57.155 --> 01:58.443
Just dance.

01:58.937 --> 02:01.690
Homer, you cannot
miss Lisa's big day.

02:01.695 --> 02:03.043
And you have to
come sober!

02:03.048 --> 02:05.022
American sober or Irish sober?

02:05.027 --> 02:06.680
Point zero eight sober.

02:06.688 --> 02:07.900
Point one five.

02:07.908 --> 02:09.091
Point zero nine.

02:09.096 --> 02:10.761
Point one zero with a

02:10.765 --> 02:11.720
stomach full of bread.

02:11.725 --> 02:12.703
My final offer.

02:13.478 --> 02:14.270
Deal.

02:18.016 --> 02:19.413
Goodnight, sweetheart.

02:24.768 --> 02:27.883
Can't be late
for Lisa's big day.

02:46.766 --> 02:47.961
I'm gonna make it.

02:47.965 --> 02:50.011
I'll be on time
for Lisa's thing.

02:50.016 --> 02:52.593
Ooh, an awesome accident.

02:52.595 --> 02:53.852
Easy, easy...

02:53.986 --> 02:56.690
I'll just take three
seconds to gawk.

02:56.695 --> 02:58.900
Aw, everyone's okay.

03:00.225 --> 03:01.991
Gonna make it.
Gonna make it.

03:06.725 --> 03:10.290
An hour and 54 minutes to spare.

03:10.308 --> 03:12.061
With my free time I can finally

03:12.067 --> 03:14.031
work on my Superman novel.

03:14.038 --> 03:15.971
"'Make way for Superman,'

03:15.976 --> 03:17.641
"said Superman as he punched

03:17.646 --> 03:19.581
everyone at the Coffee Bean.

03:19.586 --> 03:21.020
Chapter Two..."

03:25.008 --> 03:26.053
Oh, man,

03:26.055 --> 03:27.662
they just keep
kicking off awards

03:27.666 --> 03:29.572
season earlier and earlier.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.420
Yeah, the whole thing
is just a scam

03:31.426 --> 03:33.881
to sell ad space
in the school paper.

03:34.266 --> 03:37.142
That's the place that
did both my Grandmas.

03:37.147 --> 03:39.322
I did both your grandmas.

03:39.325 --> 03:40.382
Shut up!

03:40.385 --> 03:42.271
Shall we look
at the next one?

03:42.405 --> 03:43.371
Willie.

03:43.378 --> 03:44.743
He'll buy beer for you,
but he'll make

03:44.746 --> 03:46.022
you drink it with him.

03:53.738 --> 03:55.722
Darn these long bank lines.

03:55.726 --> 03:57.032
Although it does give me

03:57.038 --> 03:58.862
a moment with my thoughts.

03:58.865 --> 03:59.842
Ooh...

04:00.435 --> 04:02.620
Darn these long bank lines.

04:09.588 --> 04:11.182
That old man over
there isn't even

04:11.185 --> 04:12.870
making a transaction.

04:12.876 --> 04:14.871
He just wants
someone to talk to.

04:14.878 --> 04:17.050
Before this was
the Bank of Springfield,

04:17.055 --> 04:19.390
this was the Midwest
Savings and Loan.

04:19.397 --> 04:20.591
And before that,

04:20.596 --> 04:22.492
it was an abandoned theater.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.851
And before that,
it was a theater.

04:24.877 --> 04:27.113
Where's Dr. Kevorkian
when you need him?

04:27.118 --> 04:28.922
Well, if I know doctors,

04:28.927 --> 04:30.750
he's probably golfing.

04:32.286 --> 04:33.660
Excuse me for
a moment.

04:34.605 --> 04:36.681
Everyone down
on the floor, now!

04:39.305 --> 04:41.082
This is a robbery!

04:41.636 --> 04:43.762
Uh, not a separate
robbery we're together.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.290
You mean like a couple?

04:45.297 --> 04:46.382
- No!
- Yes!

04:46.766 --> 04:48.270
Oh, great.

04:48.275 --> 04:51.481
We're being robbed by
Johnny and Clyde!

04:56.736 --> 04:58.112
Stay away from
that button!

04:58.998 --> 04:59.961
Damn it!

05:05.937 --> 05:07.090
Well, Marge,

05:07.098 --> 05:09.583
who's the unfit parent now?

05:10.305 --> 05:12.321
You know, a principal's dream

05:12.328 --> 05:14.182
would be to have a school with

05:14.187 --> 05:16.121
nothing but Lisa Simpsons.

05:16.127 --> 05:18.563
Unfortunately, the rest of you exist.

05:18.565 --> 05:20.883
From her grade-grubbing
to her apple polishing...

05:25.656 --> 05:27.011
She's got a cell phone!

05:27.018 --> 05:28.393
We didn't plan for this, man.

05:28.408 --> 05:29.660
We didn't plan for this.

05:31.455 --> 05:33.262
Ol' Gil's here for his first

05:33.267 --> 05:34.832
day as security guard.

05:34.838 --> 05:35.512
Oh, boy...

05:38.746 --> 05:40.982
Oh, no. Now it's murder, man.

05:40.988 --> 05:42.040
It's murder.

05:45.105 --> 05:48.322
Uh, Chief, looks like
we gota 64-G in progress.

05:50.158 --> 05:51.912
Armed robbery with a gun.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.553
Come on, Chief, you know this.

05:58.556 --> 06:00.570
Oh, a shooty-stealy.

06:04.976 --> 06:07.613
And now the reason
we're all here today...

06:07.617 --> 06:09.162
Lisa Simpson!

06:14.818 --> 06:16.460
Oh, hello, Marge.

06:16.517 --> 06:18.112
I'm at the most important event

06:18.117 --> 06:19.281
of our daughter's life,

06:19.285 --> 06:21.222
and you're totally late.

06:21.228 --> 06:22.482
Am I disappointed?

06:22.485 --> 06:23.183
Yes.

06:23.226 --> 06:24.541
Am I surprised?

06:24.545 --> 06:25.252
No.

06:25.268 --> 06:26.181
Homer.

06:26.187 --> 06:29.121
I'm a hostage in
a bank robbery.

06:29.126 --> 06:29.771
What?!

06:29.776 --> 06:31.772
Oh, my God,
my sweet Margie!

06:31.777 --> 06:33.741
Okay, listen very carefully.

06:33.745 --> 06:35.612
Don't do anything they say,

06:35.615 --> 06:37.412
remain panicky, and above all,

06:37.506 --> 06:38.411
try to be a hero.

06:38.418 --> 06:39.840
Homer, I have to go.

06:39.845 --> 06:41.000
If I don't make it,

06:41.006 --> 06:42.621
feel free to remarry

06:42.627 --> 06:43.980
from anyone on the list in

06:43.986 --> 06:45.501
the bulletin board in the closet.

06:45.508 --> 06:48.113
Lindsat Naegle, Booberella,
Blythe Danner. Also, feed cat

06:50.337 --> 06:52.092
Good-bye, my love!

06:56.017 --> 06:56.541
Okay,

06:56.598 --> 06:58.162
this isn't the way
I planned it,

06:58.167 --> 06:59.753
but you can make it out alive

06:59.755 --> 07:01.230
as long as there's no funny stuff.

07:01.232 --> 07:02.599
Don't worry about me.

07:02.604 --> 07:05.419
I was voted America's
least funny clown.

07:05.416 --> 07:08.484
Worse than Scuzzo, Scummo,
Oopsie, Carlos Mencia,

07:08.489 --> 07:09.491
Stinko, Blumpy.

07:09.495 --> 07:11.302
Even worse Sergeant Serious!

07:11.307 --> 07:12.673
How could I do worse than him?!

07:12.677 --> 07:14.232
I stole all his jokes!

07:17.988 --> 07:19.551
Chief, you gotta do something

07:19.557 --> 07:21.402
my current wife is in there!

07:21.408 --> 07:22.772
Maybe you should take over,

07:22.778 --> 07:24.302
cause I got no stake in this.

07:24.307 --> 07:25.492
This isn't even my bank.

07:25.497 --> 07:27.020
I'm over at First Federal.

07:32.328 --> 07:33.840
Oh! Dye pack!

07:34.078 --> 07:35.772
Man, that stings.

07:36.306 --> 07:37.651
Oh. Damn it!

07:37.827 --> 07:39.211
What are you looking at, huh?

07:41.556 --> 07:44.570
Oh! Is anyone else a dye pack?

07:44.575 --> 07:46.343
Tell me now,
and I won't shoot you.

07:46.678 --> 07:47.803
I... Ooh!

07:48.405 --> 07:50.482
You said diabetic, right?

07:54.777 --> 07:56.251
Finally, the help we need

07:56.257 --> 07:58.313
a DVD of The Negotiator.

08:01.368 --> 08:03.003
Which chapter should we skip to?

08:03.007 --> 08:05.380
"Meet Danny Ron",
"rouble Brewing,"

08:05.387 --> 08:07.810
"Off the Case",
"My Baby's in There,"

08:07.817 --> 08:10.550
"Enter Niebaum,""Take the Shot,"

08:10.567 --> 08:13.183
"Sabian's Choice,""Check and Mate,"

08:13.187 --> 08:16.193
"Friends At Last,""Closing Credits"?

08:16.195 --> 08:17.492
Oh, man, oh, man.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.463
What the hell's taking them so long?

08:19.468 --> 08:20.882
They must be getting ready to kill me!

08:20.886 --> 08:22.030
It's no fair.

08:22.047 --> 08:23.310
I shouldn't die.

08:23.317 --> 08:25.560
I just came here to check the date!

08:29.947 --> 08:32.293
Dwight, use your noodle.

08:32.298 --> 08:33.860
If you surrender now,

08:33.868 --> 08:36.472
you're only lookingat a few years in jail.

08:36.476 --> 08:38.143
I'll tell them you're a good guy.

08:38.147 --> 08:40.289
Marge, I can't go back to prison.

08:40.297 --> 08:42.933
I've got no wife,
I've got no family.

08:42.936 --> 08:44.231
I've got nothing!

08:50.538 --> 08:52.053
If I give my self up,

08:52.156 --> 08:53.901
will you come visit
me in the joint?

08:57.925 --> 08:59.841
Hey, if I can say yes

08:59.847 --> 09:02.083
to Chinese toys that kill kids,

09:02.086 --> 09:04.220
you can say yes to him.

09:04.846 --> 09:07.791
Okay, I'll visit you, Dwight.

09:16.587 --> 09:17.980
Oh, Marge,

09:17.985 --> 09:20.611
I was afraid I was going to lose you!

09:21.617 --> 09:23.742
Now let me help you make your

09:23.748 --> 09:26.333
slow transition back to society.

09:26.336 --> 09:28.371
I just want to go home.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.401
You have a new home now with us.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.880
See ya soon, Marge.
Real soon!

09:34.886 --> 09:37.062
Just like you promised!

09:46.676 --> 09:47.982
Sweetheart,what's wrong?

09:47.987 --> 09:49.871
I promised that bank robber

09:49.875 --> 09:51.521
that I'd visit him in jail,

09:51.526 --> 09:53.193
but I just can't do it.

09:53.197 --> 09:54.663
You don't owe him anything.

09:54.666 --> 09:56.341
Moe was in the hospital for three weeks,

09:56.345 --> 09:57.830
and I didn't visit him once.

09:57.846 --> 10:00.053
You said you visited
him every night.

10:00.055 --> 10:02.750
Moe the tavern,not Moe the person.

10:02.755 --> 10:05.113
Well, promises mean more to me.

10:07.918 --> 10:09.483
Okay, you gave your word.

10:09.485 --> 10:10.833
You're going to visit him,

10:10.837 --> 10:12.060
no excuses.

10:12.065 --> 10:14.161
Ooh! Shlomo's Judaica is having

10:14.167 --> 10:16.102
a blowout on dreidels.

10:20.205 --> 10:21.790
All right, this time I'm going.

10:21.797 --> 10:24.743
I'm really going to visit a bank robber.

10:24.748 --> 10:26.690
A man who held a gun on me.

10:26.698 --> 10:28.451
Going to see him in prison,

10:28.465 --> 10:30.250
where guards will frisk me,

10:30.255 --> 10:32.312
paw through my purse, and...

10:32.317 --> 10:35.412
Ooh, there's apple picking just up the road!

10:39.886 --> 10:41.113
I'm getting a visitor today.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.741
I'm so nervous it feels like

10:42.746 --> 10:44.570
I keistered a bunch of butterflies.

10:44.578 --> 10:46.743
Dude, I highly doubt
you're getting a visitor.

10:46.747 --> 10:47.923
People don't like you.

10:47.928 --> 10:50.140
You come off needy and bug-eyed.

10:50.146 --> 10:51.180
You're wrong.

10:51.185 --> 10:52.423
Marge is coming.

10:52.428 --> 10:53.131
She is.

10:53.135 --> 10:55.733
Easy, bro. It's not like she's your mother.

10:55.736 --> 10:56.881
I wish she was.

10:56.885 --> 10:59.131
My real mother abandoned
me in an amusement park.

10:59.137 --> 11:01.750
All I have left is a caricature
from that day.

11:01.755 --> 11:04.023
Ooh. That is harsh.

11:08.888 --> 11:09.620
Hey, baby.

11:09.628 --> 11:10.630
Listen carefully.

11:10.636 --> 11:13.632
Someone's been editing
my biography on Wikipedia.

11:13.636 --> 11:14.902
I want you to kill him.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.150
No problem, sweetie.

11:16.155 --> 11:17.720
I'll dump his body in
the same lake

11:17.726 --> 11:18.971
as your lousy lawyer.

11:19.258 --> 11:20.541
Then when you get out,

11:20.546 --> 11:21.900
we can have a picnic there!

11:21.906 --> 11:24.202
Aw, that's so sweet.

11:26.916 --> 11:28.233
Anyone for me?

11:32.898 --> 11:34.642
I really shouldn't show up without

11:34.647 --> 11:36.331
an apple pie for Dwight.

11:36.337 --> 11:38.532
In fact, I really shouldn't show up

11:38.548 --> 11:41.190
without an apple pie
for everyone at the prison.

11:41.197 --> 11:43.110
Oh, my, it's 5:00.

11:43.117 --> 11:45.071
I missed visiting hours.

11:50.806 --> 11:52.042
Perfect!

11:52.047 --> 11:52.870
Look, Lisa.

11:52.876 --> 11:54.581
I put new filaments in all

11:54.586 --> 11:55.930
our burned-out light bulbs.

11:55.935 --> 11:57.503
Your father, the millionaire,

11:57.505 --> 11:59.021
thought we should throw these away.

11:59.025 --> 12:00.403
Mom, I think there's something

12:00.407 --> 12:01.832
you're trying to avoid.

12:01.837 --> 12:03.270
Or someone.

12:04.065 --> 12:06.350
Don't be silly, Lisa.

12:06.358 --> 12:07.370
In fact...

12:21.228 --> 12:24.161
Damn these sturdy, foreign-built phones.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.252
Hello.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.221
Hello?

12:28.715 --> 12:29.483
Hello?

12:31.247 --> 12:31.871
Marge?

12:32.007 --> 12:34.460
Hello, this is Ted Nugent,
the Motor City Madman,

12:34.465 --> 12:37.202
urging you to vote no
on Proposition 87.

12:37.205 --> 12:39.783
If we outlaw crossbows
in our public schools,

12:39.788 --> 12:41.143
who's gonna protect our children

12:41.155 --> 12:42.411
from charging elk?

12:42.415 --> 12:44.111
Thank you for your time,
and as always...

12:44.118 --> 12:45.520
I say Wango!

12:45.526 --> 12:47.501
I say Tango!

12:51.558 --> 12:52.880
We now return to

12:52.887 --> 12:54.491
A Kiss Before Frying.

12:56.346 --> 12:58.191
It's almost midnight.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.840
They'll be coming soon, Johnny.

12:59.848 --> 13:02.222
Coming to take you to the electric chair.

13:03.197 --> 13:04.850
I ain't afraid of old sparky,

13:04.858 --> 13:06.520
the hot seat, the kilowatt couch,

13:06.536 --> 13:08.481
the death davenport, the electric lap,

13:08.485 --> 13:10.450
the crook cooker, the scorch stool!

13:10.458 --> 13:11.673
I ain't afraid, see?

13:11.678 --> 13:13.253
No, Johnny, I don't see.

13:13.255 --> 13:14.920
You're going straight to hell, you know.

13:14.925 --> 13:16.920
I ain't afraid, 'cause my sainted Ma

13:16.928 --> 13:18.480
is comin' to visit before I go.

13:18.488 --> 13:20.460
And when I sit down
on the jolt throne,

13:20.478 --> 13:22.581
I'll be lookin' into Ma's sweet face

13:22.595 --> 13:24.671
as my tongue explodes in my mouth

13:24.676 --> 13:26.831
and the goo boils in my eyes.

13:26.838 --> 13:29.373
Oh, poor Johnny Stabbo.

13:43.878 --> 13:45.212
Prison waste

13:53.608 --> 13:54.372
Pure mountain spring water

13:54.897 --> 13:55.603
Damn it!

14:07.656 --> 14:10.280
Ma! Ma! Where are you, Ma?

14:10.285 --> 14:12.150
Don't give up hope, Johnny!

14:12.156 --> 14:13.512
Give up hope, Johnny.

14:13.516 --> 14:15.251
Your Ma ain't coming.

14:16.055 --> 14:18.901
Now, if I may do the honors.

14:19.916 --> 14:23.040
Ma. Ma. Ma...!

14:24.877 --> 14:28.993
Ma.a.a.!!!!

14:30.217 --> 14:34.032
Ma...!

14:36.948 --> 14:40.263
Hostage returns home to
742 Evergreen terrace

14:40.267 --> 14:42.512
Alarm code 3457

14:45.645 --> 14:48.773
Itchy and Scratchy Show.

14:56.047 --> 14:58.130
You're out.

14:58.485 --> 15:00.670
Psst, psst!

15:02.898 --> 15:05.370
Steroids cause health problems

15:05.378 --> 15:07.410
Sluggers make millions.

15:18.065 --> 15:18.782
South pole

15:20.698 --> 15:21.831
Greatest hero ever

15:24.846 --> 15:27.842
You're disgracing America's pastime.

15:27.847 --> 15:29.623
You should be ashamed of yourself.

15:29.625 --> 15:30.620
What the...?

15:55.948 --> 15:57.373
Hall of shame

16:02.095 --> 16:04.423
We interrupt this Annie
Award-winning cartoon

16:04.425 --> 16:05.671
for an important bulletin.

16:05.676 --> 16:07.870
Convicted bank robber
Dwight David Diddle Hopper

16:07.878 --> 16:10.070
has escaped from
Springfield Penitentiary.

16:10.078 --> 16:12.770
The escapee left a note
saying he will turn himself

16:12.775 --> 16:16.443
in after he takes care of one
unfinished piece of business.

16:16.446 --> 16:18.352
The police have issue da statement saying,

16:18.358 --> 16:19.811
"That seems more than fair."

16:20.936 --> 16:23.581
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

16:24.985 --> 16:27.393
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

16:28.845 --> 16:31.363
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

16:32.535 --> 16:35.090
<i>Who can it be now?</i>

16:36.455 --> 16:39.823
<i>Who can it be knocking at my door?</i>

16:39.828 --> 16:41.340
<i>Make no sound</i>

16:42.005 --> 16:44.091
<i>Tiptoe across the floor</i>

16:44.098 --> 16:46.731
<i>If he hears, he'll knock all...</i>

16:46.737 --> 16:48.021
Oh, hey, oh.

16:48.027 --> 16:50.443
Oh, wait, this ain't
where I go to vote.

16:57.107 --> 16:58.800
Hello, Marge.

17:01.065 --> 17:03.363
Man, these cars look all a like.

17:04.846 --> 17:05.760
Now drive !

17:08.978 --> 17:11.329
Dwight!

17:11.765 --> 17:14.592
I-I was just on my way
to see you in prison.

17:14.598 --> 17:15.771
Really, Marge?

17:15.777 --> 17:17.853
Look me in the eyes and say that.

17:17.855 --> 17:18.782
Okay.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.693
They're so buggy, I can't.

17:26.744 --> 17:29.621
Dwight, please,
don't do anything crazy.

17:29.627 --> 17:31.871
- Just pull over there.
- Huh?

17:34.395 --> 17:37.223
Um, what are we doing here?

17:37.427 --> 17:39.961
This is where my mom
abandoned me.

17:39.967 --> 17:42.340
Oh, that's so sad.

17:42.345 --> 17:43.540
Ya think?

17:47.235 --> 17:48.453
Marge, can you please

17:48.455 --> 17:49.983
give me the day my mother didn't?

17:49.986 --> 17:52.382
Ride some rides, eat some cotton candy.

17:52.388 --> 17:53.513
I'll let you go home.

17:53.518 --> 17:55.942
Okay, but I'd feel better about it

17:55.948 --> 17:57.730
if you got rid of the gun.

17:57.738 --> 17:59.740
I'd like to, but then
you'll leave like she did.

17:59.748 --> 18:02.002
Can you at least put it in your jacket ?

18:02.005 --> 18:04.600
Fine, but I'm still gonna
make that pointy shape.

18:08.746 --> 18:09.790
Krusty.

18:09.795 --> 18:12.383
I haven't see you since
that terrifying day.

18:12.957 --> 18:16.051
Uh, you'll have to be way more specific.

18:16.055 --> 18:17.592
We were hostages at the bank.

18:17.595 --> 18:18.860
Oh, yeah.

18:18.868 --> 18:22.291
Sorry I offered your life for my safety.

18:22.906 --> 18:24.522
Look, it's Marge!

18:24.707 --> 18:25.942
With Dwight !

18:25.955 --> 18:28.230
I said there was a spark
between them,

18:28.235 --> 18:30.021
and you said, "No way."

18:30.027 --> 18:33.533
I saw it, I just didn't feel like talking to you.

18:33.537 --> 18:35.763
Wait, something's screwy here.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.183
I'm calling the cops.

18:37.187 --> 18:40.121
Don't bother, they're right over here.

18:40.125 --> 18:41.841
Easy, easy.

18:41.847 --> 18:43.291
Line up your shot,

18:43.297 --> 18:45.223
then squeeze it off.

18:46.855 --> 18:49.771
Uh, Chief, I think we got
a hostage situation over there.

18:49.965 --> 18:52.920
Can't a man spend one minute
with his stuffed monkey?

18:52.928 --> 18:53.892
One minute ?

18:54.095 --> 18:55.723
A monkey would make a better chief.

18:55.807 --> 18:56.771
What did you say?

18:56.775 --> 18:59.651
I said monkey would
make a better chief!

18:59.657 --> 19:01.131
He's a good monkey, all right.

19:06.836 --> 19:08.303
The Viking boats!

19:08.308 --> 19:10.562
This is where I lost
my first mom.

19:11.586 --> 19:14.390
Well, this mom is not
gonna say bug-eye.

19:14.407 --> 19:16.343
I mean, good-bye.

19:17.145 --> 19:18.873
Damn it!

19:23.956 --> 19:27.140
Boy, I really feel like
a Viking in this thing.

19:28.098 --> 19:30.860
I'll show them which monkey
would make the best chief!

19:34.675 --> 19:36.223
Stop the boats!

19:36.816 --> 19:38.710
Sorry, Mister !

19:39.635 --> 19:41.731
Are you kidding me?!

19:42.436 --> 19:44.200
Dwight do something!

19:44.656 --> 19:45.482
Okay !

19:45.556 --> 19:46.632
For you Ma.

19:50.338 --> 19:50.902
Great.

19:50.908 --> 19:51.880
Dwight!

19:51.888 --> 19:53.162
Are you okay ?

19:53.175 --> 19:54.463
Dwight!

19:56.108 --> 19:57.192
He will be fine.

19:57.198 --> 19:59.430
Not you and me fine, but fine.

19:59.436 --> 20:01.250
Hey, leave that comedy to me.

20:01.256 --> 20:03.640
Okay, funny man, make me laugh.

20:06.495 --> 20:09.540
Instead of a carnival ride, what if he was run over

20:09.545 --> 20:12.141
by a Zamboni with a moustache?

20:12.155 --> 20:14.301
- I don't see how.
- Then I got nothing.

20:16.068 --> 20:18.211
Dwight, that was the most

20:18.215 --> 20:20.120
unselfish thing I've ever seen.

20:20.128 --> 20:22.730
I'm sorry I didn't visit you before.

20:22.817 --> 20:23.562
Hey, Marge.

20:23.565 --> 20:25.591
Look at us, the four amigos.

20:25.595 --> 20:27.762
They're gonna let me do some oddjobs

20:27.766 --> 20:29.161
for them on the outside.

20:29.165 --> 20:30.421
Listen, outside my cell,

20:30.427 --> 20:32.041
I saw one dandelion growing.

20:32.055 --> 20:33.101
I picked it for you.

20:34.148 --> 20:35.850
Then I pressed it in my Bible to dry.

20:37.168 --> 20:39.251
I carved a frame for it
out of a bar of soap.

20:40.077 --> 20:41.630
Read the inscription
on the back.

20:41.636 --> 20:43.580
"You chat up the guard at the gate,

20:43.598 --> 20:45.952
while I knife the guard behind me."

20:46.565 --> 20:48.111
I can't do that, Dwight.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.431
I figured you'd say that.

20:50.227 --> 20:51.561
But you can keep it though.

20:51.565 --> 20:53.361
Aw, thank you.
