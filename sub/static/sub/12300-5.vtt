WEBVTT

01:01.502 --> 01:02.545
Father Carlos?

01:08.634 --> 01:11.345
Detective Sevilla, Megan.
What do we got?

01:11.345 --> 01:14.474
The body was found at 7:40 this morning
by the vic's housekeeper.

01:14.474 --> 01:17.018
She checked on him when
he didn't show up for mass.

01:17.018 --> 01:18.478
She still inside?

01:18.478 --> 01:20.980
Yeah, she said she cleaned
up his residence last night.

01:20.980 --> 01:25.777
And at 8:15, that place was spotless.
And when she left, he was alone ...

01:25.777 --> 01:27.236
and alive.

01:37.205 --> 01:40.708
Expended shell casing right here.

01:40.708 --> 01:43.836
A bullet strike on the
wall right over there.

01:49.008 --> 01:51.052
Who would want to kill a priest?

01:52.095 --> 01:53.721
Nowadays?

01:53.721 --> 01:54.972
Anyone.

02:49.726 --> 02:51.352
What does it look like, Speed?

02:51.352 --> 02:54.939
Partial prints under the coffee table.
And that's just the beginning.

02:55.982 --> 03:01.196
Liver temp is 82. He was probably
killed between nine and midnight.

03:01.571 --> 03:03.740
Okay, I'll be there.
Megan.

03:03.740 --> 03:04.949
Yeah.

03:04.949 --> 03:07.702
I have another scene.
Are you good to go on this?

03:07.702 --> 03:10.371
Sure. I'm just waiting for Speedle
to finish up with the prints.

03:10.371 --> 03:12.832
Okay. Keep me posted.

03:13.875 --> 03:18.046
Possible entrance wound
back of his neck.

03:19.130 --> 03:21.758
And the second here
to the shoulder.

03:23.843 --> 03:28.014
And what looks like an exit
wound under his heart.

03:36.606 --> 03:40.777
And a third entrance
here in his thigh.

03:43.029 --> 03:46.574
What can you tell us, Father
about who did this to you?

03:46.574 --> 03:51.788
Well, whoever it was meant business and he
used a rifle to conduct his business with.

03:52.539 --> 03:57.752
Three possible shots and only two casings.
Are we missing one?

03:57.752 --> 03:58.503
Megan.

04:06.636 --> 04:08.680
Two different shoes?

04:08.680 --> 04:13.893
Or a guy with a limp, prosthetic leg or something.
One's definitely more worn in.

04:15.937 --> 04:20.233
So those are different than the
priest's bloody footprints.

04:20.233 --> 04:22.318
There's no sign of break-in.

04:22.318 --> 04:24.362
Priests open their door
to lots of people.

04:24.362 --> 04:26.364
Now, this is interesting.

04:26.364 --> 04:30.827
One glass smells like scotch. The other
one has no smell, but a clear lip print.

04:32.161 --> 04:33.830
Looks like lip gloss.

04:34.873 --> 04:38.167
Priests can have a drink.
They can also have company over.

04:38.167 --> 04:39.752
You got an uncle who's
a priest, right?

04:39.752 --> 04:44.090
Jesuit. He drinks, smokes, plays poker.
Just doesn't have sex.

04:44.507 --> 04:47.552
Don't know if we can say the
same about our priest.

04:47.552 --> 04:49.637
Condom in his pocket?

04:58.855 --> 05:00.106
Delko?
Yeah, he's down there.

05:00.106 --> 05:01.608
Thank you.

05:01.900 --> 05:06.404
You need to contact Georgia Highway Patrol.
That car in the ravine was stolen.

05:09.866 --> 05:10.909
Eric!

05:15.205 --> 05:19.375
Got a female driver, H.
She's dead.

05:19.375 --> 05:20.919
No passengers?

05:20.919 --> 05:23.296
No, just a bottle of booze.

05:23.296 --> 05:26.090
Car was reported stolen two
weeks ago in Georgia.

05:27.342 --> 05:30.303
Tire treads indicate she went
straight over the edge.

05:31.346 --> 05:33.765
Could be suicide.
No skid marks.

05:34.807 --> 05:36.267
Maybe she just missed the turn.

05:37.310 --> 05:39.145
Let's take a look.

05:41.231 --> 05:43.691
All right, watch your step there, H.
No problem.

05:45.151 --> 05:47.904
Thinking the fuel line ruptured
when the car hit bottom.

05:48.947 --> 05:51.616
Or the gas tank punctured and
sparks set it off on impact.

05:51.616 --> 05:52.659
Check this out.

06:00.708 --> 06:04.879
Our car thief has expensive tastes.
That's a $400 bottle of cognac.

06:15.849 --> 06:16.933
Get an ID?

06:17.433 --> 06:20.770
No. I found a purse twelve feet from
the car, but nothing inside.

06:20.770 --> 06:22.480
No pictures, no receipts?

06:22.480 --> 06:24.399
Nothing else except a suitcase.

06:24.399 --> 06:28.778
Now, why would this poor thing travel with
a purse and a suitcase and no ID?

06:32.657 --> 06:36.828
Last time I was in church was
when Kurt Cobain died.

06:51.092 --> 06:52.677
You got something?

06:53.720 --> 06:55.805
I don't know.
I'm not sure.

07:12.906 --> 07:13.948
Thanks.

07:19.704 --> 07:20.914
Blood.

07:20.914 --> 07:25.585
The killer washed his hands, huh?
A regular Pontius Pilate.

07:25.877 --> 07:27.670
Or he blessed himself.

07:29.756 --> 07:32.550
Which means we're probably
looking for a devout catholic.

07:35.136 --> 07:37.388
Don't say I never gave
you anything.

07:37.388 --> 07:39.265
Two-two-three.

07:41.351 --> 07:43.186
Hunting rifle.

07:44.229 --> 07:45.772
Same as from wall.

07:46.814 --> 07:50.318
Homemade bullet
cast with hot lead.

07:50.318 --> 07:52.403
Definite reload.

07:56.616 --> 07:57.951
Sure is mangled.

07:57.951 --> 08:00.161
It's mangled because it entered the body...

08:00.161 --> 08:01.913
twice.

08:01.913 --> 08:03.456
Like this.

08:03.456 --> 08:04.707
I need some muscle.

08:04.707 --> 08:06.793
This will give us an exact route.

08:06.793 --> 08:08.044
Okay.

08:08.878 --> 08:12.757
First shot to the shoulder was
a through-and-through.

08:13.800 --> 08:19.013
Went into the shoulder out the back...

08:19.597 --> 08:20.723
and into the wall.

08:22.642 --> 08:25.353
The second shot was closer range.

08:27.021 --> 08:29.941
I've got stippling where it entered
at the base of his neck ...

08:29.941 --> 08:35.154
then tore through his lung hit the
aorta before leaving his chest.

08:35.613 --> 08:38.032
Now, this is the interesting part.

08:38.032 --> 08:43.037
And then the same bullet
reentered here ...

08:43.037 --> 08:45.206
in his thigh where the femur ...

08:45.206 --> 08:47.000
flattened it.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.752
That's why there were only two
casings at the rectory.

08:49.752 --> 08:52.171
Only two rounds were fired.

09:00.513 --> 09:01.723
What have you got?

09:02.765 --> 09:04.726
A car explosion.

09:04.726 --> 09:08.271
Burned victim. Checking for
cognac used as an accelerant.

09:09.355 --> 09:10.773
Can you beat that?

09:10.773 --> 09:15.987
Yeah. I got a priest shot with
a rifle dead in a church.

09:16.779 --> 09:17.697
That's not bad.

09:17.697 --> 09:19.449
Not bad?
It's not bad.

09:19.449 --> 09:22.493
It's at least a draw. You're not going
to beat me with a burned-out car.

09:22.493 --> 09:25.747
Oh, boys and their measuring sticks.
You guys crack me up.

09:25.747 --> 09:27.040
Hey.
Hey.

09:27.457 --> 09:28.416
Is it lipstick?

09:28.416 --> 09:31.961
I'm still narrowing brands.
It's not lipstick or lip gloss.

09:31.961 --> 09:32.670
What is it?

09:32.670 --> 09:36.591
Lip balm.
With an SPF 45.

09:36.591 --> 09:39.761
Unique ingredient --
macadamia oil.

09:39.761 --> 09:41.179
Any prints on the condom?

09:41.179 --> 09:42.722
Father Carlos.

09:42.722 --> 09:45.934
In my senior year Sister Mary Francis
found a condom in my desk.

09:45.934 --> 09:47.143
Her prints would
have been on it.

09:47.143 --> 09:48.937
Yeah, right.

09:50.605 --> 09:51.940
I got something here.

09:52.774 --> 09:55.068
Those are lip balms used by kids.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.529
Who skateboard or surf.

09:57.529 --> 10:02.325
A teenage boy, a priest.
We might have motive.

10:07.705 --> 10:09.123
What do you see, Alexx?

10:09.415 --> 10:12.794
It's what I don't see.
Any broken bones.

10:12.794 --> 10:15.964
She may have been drinking.
The tox screen isn't back yet.

10:15.964 --> 10:20.468
I've seen drunks so looped they've fallen out of
a moving car at sixty and don't break a finger.

10:21.511 --> 10:22.554
Checking passages.

10:34.023 --> 10:35.525
There's soot in her lungs.

10:36.359 --> 10:38.444
So, she was alive during the fire.

10:39.487 --> 10:42.115
I hope you didn't suffer too much, darling.

10:42.407 --> 10:46.578
Alexx, if she's going to help us we
need to know who she is.

10:48.621 --> 10:50.874
Can't get prints from bone.

10:51.916 --> 10:56.713
Checking stomach contents for time
between last meal and time of death.

11:10.643 --> 11:13.771
Oh. You're not going
to believe this.

11:26.451 --> 11:27.994
A diamond ring.

11:28.745 --> 11:33.958
Looks like she ate about four
carats for her last supper.

11:35.418 --> 11:36.502
Eric?

11:36.502 --> 11:40.131
Check with missing persons and her
dental records are going to come up dry.

11:40.131 --> 11:43.384
Toxicology screen came up.
Not a trace of alcohol.

11:43.384 --> 11:46.638
But she did ingest fifteen micrograms
per mil of demerol.

11:46.638 --> 11:49.641
Fifteen micrograms.
That's enough to kill yourself twice.

11:49.641 --> 11:52.769
She also reported high
levels of folic acid.

11:55.271 --> 11:56.814
She was pregnant.

11:56.814 --> 11:57.857
Seven weeks.

12:52.577 --> 12:53.912
There's no damage to the fuel line.

12:53.912 --> 12:58.083
And no print on the truck. Take a look
at what I found buried in the front seat.

13:01.002 --> 13:05.173
Also ... I found this melted into
the floor panel on the back.

13:06.299 --> 13:08.510
Well, there's no glass from the
bottle around the cork.

13:08.510 --> 13:12.263
What that means is the cognac
bottle didn't break during the crash

13:12.263 --> 13:14.933
and the cork had
been removed before.

13:14.933 --> 13:16.893
Maybe someone used it
as an accelerant.

13:16.893 --> 13:18.061
They poured it all over her ...

13:18.061 --> 13:22.023
... tossed the bottle in the back and,
uh, it melted in the fire.

13:22.023 --> 13:24.275
Something is still missing.
See here?

13:24.776 --> 13:28.238
See the char in
the burn indicator? Look at this.

13:28.238 --> 13:33.201
See, it means that the origin of the fire was in
the back seat and it traveled to the front seat.

13:33.201 --> 13:36.287
It also means that the
fire was hot enough ...

13:36.287 --> 13:40.041
... to melt glass before the
fire department got there.

13:41.084 --> 13:44.170
And she was covered in cognac
so the fire didn't miss her.

13:44.170 --> 13:47.716
Yes, but we still don't know
what started the fire.

13:47.716 --> 13:50.385
I don't know, maybe, uh,
maybe a spark on impact.

13:50.385 --> 13:52.470
I don't think so.
Not a spark.

13:52.470 --> 13:55.932
The killer has gone to all this
trouble he's going to hope for a spark?

13:56.975 --> 13:57.934
I think ...

13:57.934 --> 14:02.856
that whoever did this wanted to make sure that this
mother and child were never identified again.

14:02.856 --> 14:04.441
That's what I think.

14:04.441 --> 14:07.277
You sure know how to brighten up
a girl's day, don't you?

14:07.277 --> 14:10.071
I've got nothing, Alexx.
I need an I.D. on the father.

14:10.071 --> 14:15.285
Well, your best shot for a match on CODIS
is if his DNA has unique characteristics.

14:15.994 --> 14:17.704
Are you ready for this?

14:17.704 --> 14:20.832
Fetal tissue recovery is the one
thing I'm never ready for.

14:47.275 --> 14:49.361
Not just skin cells, is it?

14:55.784 --> 14:56.826
Thank you, Alexx.

15:56.052 --> 15:59.055
We know the caliber of
round was a .223.

15:59.472 --> 16:04.269
And the blood he lost while laying against
the wall was approximately half liter.

16:04.269 --> 16:07.147
With that information we can
estimate that Father Carlos ...

16:07.147 --> 16:12.360
laid bleeding for ten seconds before
he walked to his killer.

16:12.360 --> 16:15.113
Plenty of time for the killer to come
over and shoot him.

16:15.113 --> 16:19.284
But he didn't. Why?
What happened in those ten seconds?

16:20.493 --> 16:21.828
Hey.
Hey.

16:22.579 --> 16:24.372
Check this out.

16:24.372 --> 16:26.249
The shoe prints left at the rectory ...

16:27.792 --> 16:29.753
were DVS.

16:29.753 --> 16:31.337
Who wears DVS?

16:31.337 --> 16:32.505
Skateboarders.

16:32.505 --> 16:37.510
The reason for the difference in the wear
is because one foot is always on the board ...

16:37.510 --> 16:42.724
staying new, and the other foot
pushes off from the ground, wearing out.

16:44.392 --> 16:46.144
This person's goofy footed.

16:46.144 --> 16:49.814
He keeps his right foot on the board,
pushes off with his left.

16:50.065 --> 16:50.857
That's not as common.

16:50.857 --> 16:53.485
And you know this how,
Miss Three-Inch Heels?

16:55.278 --> 16:59.407
Okay, so we're looking for a teenager
around 5'2" probably left-handed.

16:59.824 --> 17:01.910
Let's bring in the altar boys.

17:31.815 --> 17:34.442
All right, could you guys all
sit down for a minute?

17:35.485 --> 17:37.987
I'm going to need
you to lift your left foot.

17:50.041 --> 17:51.126
And then the other one.

17:51.835 --> 17:53.920
Yeah, if you could stand up.

18:04.222 --> 18:08.685
Mrs. Medina, with this warrant do you understand
that we have the right to search your home ...

18:08.685 --> 18:10.812
and sample you and your son's DNA?

18:10.812 --> 18:14.315
Yes. But why?
We didn't do anything.

18:14.315 --> 18:16.526
Do you want to take Cameron
outside till we're done?

18:17.569 --> 18:18.945
Yeah, sure.

18:22.073 --> 18:26.244
Gracias. Esta bien mi hijo.
No te preocupes. Vate con ella.

19:50.370 --> 19:51.413
Mrs. Medina ...

19:51.746 --> 19:56.251
we were told the police had been here a number
of times for domestic disturbance calls.

19:56.501 --> 19:59.629
My husband and I have
had our troubles.

19:59.629 --> 20:01.047
Where is your husband now?

20:02.090 --> 20:03.967
Your guess is as good as mine.

20:05.010 --> 20:07.095
Well, we're going to need
to speak to him.

20:08.138 --> 20:10.390
When my husband leaves on business...

20:10.390 --> 20:13.727
I don't ask where and I don't
ask for how long.

20:20.025 --> 20:22.402
Thanks.
That wasn't too bad, was it?

20:23.862 --> 20:25.655
Adell, I need a minute with him.

20:26.698 --> 20:27.741
All right.

20:32.495 --> 20:33.455
Cameron ...

20:34.497 --> 20:37.792
why were you at
Father Carlos' Saturday night?

20:38.209 --> 20:40.837
I wasn't.
I was skateboarding.

20:41.129 --> 20:42.589
Skateboarding at night?

20:43.298 --> 20:45.967
At Ollie Oop.
It has indoor ramps.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.511
The thing is, Cameron,

20:49.554 --> 20:53.725
I know you were there because we matched
your lip prints to a glass we found.

20:54.726 --> 20:57.771
And your shoe prints match the
ones we took from the floor.

20:59.522 --> 21:00.774
So, you want to try again?

21:03.568 --> 21:07.739
I just went to tell him I didn't want
to be an altar boy anymore.

21:10.658 --> 21:12.035
What happened?

21:13.078 --> 21:15.288
No! Get away from me!

21:15.288 --> 21:16.790
Cameron, wait!

21:17.832 --> 21:21.294
Cameron, was Father Carlos
hurting you?

21:23.213 --> 21:25.298
That's between me and god now.

21:38.186 --> 21:41.940
I tested the residue on the bullets
that killed Father Carlos and, uh,

21:43.149 --> 21:44.526
G-6. Bingo.

21:44.859 --> 21:48.279
It matches the powder I found in
both the casings and the reloader.

21:48.279 --> 21:51.116
Same manufacturer.
Everything's pointing to Cameron.

21:51.116 --> 21:52.867
He had access to the guns.

21:52.867 --> 21:56.621
And he admits to being in the rectory
the night Father Carlos was killed.

21:56.621 --> 21:59.165
There's only one problem.
What?

21:59.165 --> 22:00.333
It wasn't him.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.836
Here's Cameron the night
Father Carlos was killed.

22:02.836 --> 22:06.214
It was taken by a photographer at the Ollie
Oop who sells his pictures to the kids.

22:06.214 --> 22:08.258
That picture could be taken anytime.

22:08.258 --> 22:10.301
It could have, but it wasn't.

22:10.301 --> 22:12.012
Look at the bottom of the picture.

22:12.012 --> 22:15.974
It's a digital imprint made by the camera
when the picture was taken.

22:15.974 --> 22:17.517
Saturday was the 26th.

22:19.602 --> 22:22.605
And this one was taken at 10:30.

22:23.648 --> 22:25.984
So, he was exactly where
he said he was.

22:25.984 --> 22:27.193
When he said he was.

22:27.193 --> 22:29.612
Which means Cameron's
not our shooter.

22:37.454 --> 22:39.080
Hey, was it as bad as they say?

22:39.914 --> 22:41.624
It was worse.

22:41.624 --> 22:46.421
It was worse and the CODIS search
for the father's DNA is negative.

22:46.421 --> 22:48.465
It's hard to search with half the DNA.

22:48.465 --> 22:50.342
How did we do on the dress
and the melted glass?

22:50.342 --> 22:52.510
Big surprise, actually.

22:52.510 --> 22:55.930
The dress was covered in cognac
but the melted glass wasn't.

22:55.930 --> 22:59.225
As a matter of fact the melted glass
wasn't from the cognac bottle at all.

22:59.225 --> 23:04.731
Sulfuric acid, sugar gasoline,
potassium chloride...

23:04.731 --> 23:06.483
-- that's an
exothermic reaction, isn't it?

23:06.483 --> 23:10.487
That's right. You paste the potassium chlorate
and sugar to the back of the paper label,

23:10.487 --> 23:14.324
then you pour the sulfuric acid and
gasoline into the empty bottle ...

23:14.324 --> 23:18.286
... and when the bottle breaks you
serve up a molotov cocktail.

23:18.286 --> 23:20.413
Killer's not taking any chances.

23:20.413 --> 23:23.541
Look, have a look at this.
Tell me what you think.

23:26.836 --> 23:29.547
Okay, I can tell you that this was
done with an Excimer laser ...

23:29.547 --> 23:34.260
and its inscription point was no more
than three microns in diameter.

23:35.512 --> 23:38.973
Okay, how do you know that though?
You were a jewel thief in another life? What?

23:38.973 --> 23:42.227
Well, in another life I incarcerated
many a jewel thief.

23:42.227 --> 23:46.564
Well, why ruin a perfectly good diamond
with a $30,000 billboard?

23:46.564 --> 23:47.816
That's not what they're doing.

23:47.816 --> 23:52.404
They reserve this for the best
diamonds and the best customers.

24:04.456 --> 24:05.498
How's it going?

24:06.541 --> 24:10.545
Well, I tested the guns I found
in the Medinas' shed.

24:10.545 --> 24:13.256
And the rounds that killed Father Carlos
don't match any of them.

24:14.424 --> 24:16.092
So we're still missing a rifle.

24:19.763 --> 24:21.890
Something's going on in that house.

24:21.890 --> 24:27.103
Even if Cameron's not our shooter, he still
lied about being at the rectory that night.

24:27.103 --> 24:28.647
I have a theory.
Go.

24:28.647 --> 24:30.732
We know the dad is violent.

24:30.732 --> 24:33.443
What if he thought Father Carlos
was molesting Cameron?

24:36.404 --> 24:38.698
Let's see if we can find
dad and ask him.

24:39.741 --> 24:42.244
Do you recognize this ring?

24:43.995 --> 24:46.122
Yes, yes.
Of course, I do.

24:46.122 --> 24:47.582
But what are you doing with it?

24:48.959 --> 24:50.627
Did something happen to Lisa?

24:50.627 --> 24:52.462
Does Lisa have a last name?

24:52.462 --> 24:55.715
Valdez -- Lisa Marie Valdez. Please tell me
if something's happened to her.

24:55.715 --> 24:57.259
According to Stewart Diamonds...

24:57.259 --> 25:01.221
you and Lisa were in eleven weeks
ago to purchase that ring.

25:01.221 --> 25:03.473
That sounds about right.
But I don't ...

25:03.473 --> 25:05.350
I-I don't know exactly.
I'm not sure.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.102
When was the last time
you saw her?

25:07.102 --> 25:09.437
Maybe seven, maybe
eight weeks ago.

25:09.437 --> 25:12.566
So, buying her a rock that large
caused you a problem, didn't it?

25:12.566 --> 25:14.401
The problem was that I ...

25:14.401 --> 25:18.280
gave it to her to show her my
appreciation for ...

25:18.697 --> 25:19.990
an intimate night together.

25:19.990 --> 25:23.493
Right. So, let me guess: Lisa took that
to mean that it was more than a souvenir.

25:23.493 --> 25:26.162
Now, don't! J-just give me the ring back!
Wait! What are you ... no! No!

25:26.162 --> 25:27.539
Give me the ring! No!
Give me the ring! No!

25:27.539 --> 25:29.624
Okay, fine.

25:32.919 --> 25:34.170
Then she obsessed.

25:34.170 --> 25:38.633
And-and I didn't want to hurt her I-I just
... so I just cut it cold turkey.

25:38.633 --> 25:40.177
And now she's dead.

25:40.177 --> 25:43.388
Dead? How?
Suicide?

25:45.140 --> 25:47.225
Does this look like a suicide to you?

25:57.485 --> 25:59.738
We're looking for the dad.
We found his truck.

26:00.155 --> 26:01.531
Well, that's a start.

26:01.531 --> 26:05.035
You know, you said the truck showed
up Sunday but Emilio Medina didn't?

26:05.035 --> 26:05.785
That's right.

26:05.785 --> 26:08.496
All right. So, when was the last
time you did see him?

26:08.496 --> 26:13.001
Well, he hasn't been to work since,
I guess since end of last week.

26:13.293 --> 26:15.462
You mean, he's not away on business?

26:15.462 --> 26:18.006
Only business he's got is
in a smelly sewer.

26:18.006 --> 26:20.091
Do you mind if we take a look?

26:54.918 --> 26:56.711
We might have something here.

26:59.130 --> 26:59.881
What is it?

26:59.881 --> 27:01.383
Dried blood.

27:03.468 --> 27:06.596
And a hair ... dropped
while the blood was wet.

27:17.274 --> 27:19.651
Does this look like anything
besides rust to you?

27:23.989 --> 27:25.240
A rifle rack.

27:29.494 --> 27:33.999
Mr. Jones, is there any reason why
Emilio Medina would carry a rifle?

27:34.624 --> 27:37.919
You ever see a gator coming
towards you in a sewer?

27:37.919 --> 27:40.463
Hell, you don't talk to the son
of a bitch, you shoot it.

27:41.506 --> 27:44.551
I see. I'd like to ask you
some questions.

27:46.636 --> 27:48.722
So, where's Emilio Medina?

27:50.348 --> 27:51.391
And his rifle?

27:58.773 --> 28:02.110
She was the vic.
She was pretty.

28:02.110 --> 28:04.196
Yes, she is.

28:04.196 --> 28:07.490
Yes, she is. Everything we need to
convict this guy is right here.

28:07.908 --> 28:08.950
Let's find it.

28:26.218 --> 28:31.431
We've got three pairs of shoes a bottle
of cognac, and some roses.

28:31.723 --> 28:34.851
All dressed up and nowhere to go.

28:38.772 --> 28:39.814
What is it?

28:40.857 --> 28:43.109
More importantly, what was it?

28:44.152 --> 28:47.280
Feels rubbery.
Let's take a look.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.335
What's it say to you?

29:01.378 --> 29:02.921
What does it smell like to you?

29:04.589 --> 29:05.715
Strawberries?

29:05.715 --> 29:10.220
So, what do you get when you
cross strawberries with rubber?

29:11.763 --> 29:13.390
A guaranteed good time.

29:14.099 --> 29:15.433
Here's what we're going to do.

29:17.519 --> 29:21.439
Go to this address...
with a photograph of Douglas.

29:21.439 --> 29:26.653
And ask Artie if he has recently sold
any strawberry-scented rubber...

29:28.196 --> 29:29.364
teddies.

29:31.116 --> 29:32.534
"Artie's Adult Playground"?

29:32.534 --> 29:34.536
Do you know Artie?
Do you know Artie?

29:34.536 --> 29:36.663
Just go to the address, Eric.

29:38.748 --> 29:42.711
Well, the blood from the steering
wheel belongs to father Carlos.

29:42.711 --> 29:44.629
Have you matched the
hair to anyone yet?

29:44.629 --> 29:47.716
Not yet. I still have to test it
from the hair at the house.

29:48.341 --> 29:49.634
What about this?

29:49.634 --> 29:51.887
Inside the teeth of the wrench.
Take a look.

29:53.972 --> 29:56.183
It always reminds me
of sticky oysters.

29:57.017 --> 30:00.353
It looks like melted provolone.
What is it?

30:00.353 --> 30:01.897
Brain matter.

30:01.897 --> 30:04.858
Father Carlos didn't have
a head contusion.

30:04.858 --> 30:05.901
I know.

30:38.058 --> 30:39.184
Look.

30:41.186 --> 30:42.979
Brain matter is dad's.

30:42.979 --> 30:48.401
So ... if it was Cameron's dad that killed Father
Carlos he did it without his temporal lobe.

30:49.402 --> 30:50.779
Hard to do.

31:18.855 --> 31:20.357
Those look like drag marks.

31:23.151 --> 31:26.279
Do you think if we dragged the river
we'd find the missing rifle out there?

31:28.156 --> 31:29.658
The scent dog found something.

31:29.658 --> 31:30.700
Let's go.

31:42.796 --> 31:44.881
Dirt's been disturbed.

32:15.662 --> 32:17.205
Looks like dried blood.

32:17.831 --> 32:19.916
It doesn't look like anything
mom would wear.

32:26.923 --> 32:28.508
Excuse me.

32:30.593 --> 32:31.970
Megan Donner.

32:31.970 --> 32:35.307
Hey, uh, I finished running the hair
on the steering wheel.

32:35.807 --> 32:38.685
Well, I compared it to the hair that
I took from the father's brush, ...

32:38.685 --> 32:40.353
... and it didn't match,

32:40.353 --> 32:43.732
but right now, I'm looking
at the one that does.

32:43.732 --> 32:47.277
It's the hair you found embedded
in the wall in Cameron's room.

32:49.946 --> 32:52.115
Both of the hairs match
Cameron's mother...

32:52.115 --> 32:55.452
which means Mrs. Medina was
driving that truck.

32:56.244 --> 32:58.538
Thanks, Speed.

33:03.418 --> 33:05.128
We're going to need
to talk to the mother.

33:07.213 --> 33:08.256
Let's go.

33:17.515 --> 33:18.767
Oh, man.

33:20.852 --> 33:21.603
Eric.

33:21.603 --> 33:26.733
Artie says hello and that Douglas came in to
satisfy his rubber fetish about three days ago.

33:26.733 --> 33:29.194
So, he lied to us about the last
time he saw Lisa Marie...

33:29.194 --> 33:31.404
and that doesn't prove he killed her so,
we go back to the jeep.

33:31.404 --> 33:32.197
I already have.

33:32.197 --> 33:33.657
No, no, listen to me.
Go back to the jeep.

33:33.657 --> 33:37.744
H, I already have.
There's not a print, a trace, a fiber.

33:37.744 --> 33:40.872
There's nothing left in that jeep
that connects him to her.

33:45.835 --> 33:48.963
So, he's ... going to get
away with it.

33:52.467 --> 33:54.719
That's what you're telling me:
He's going to get away with it.

33:54.719 --> 33:57.847
He's going to get to crawl back under that
rock that he slithered out from ...

33:58.556 --> 34:01.685
because he's killed the only person
that knows the truth.

34:03.269 --> 34:04.521
Right?

34:05.814 --> 34:07.357
Well, for now.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.442
For now.

34:14.155 --> 34:15.364
Okay.

34:18.493 --> 34:20.578
Hey, Jerome, do me a
favor, will you?

34:28.128 --> 34:30.213
Let me know when you're
finished with that, all right?

34:37.762 --> 34:40.889
This has nothing to do
with Cameron.

34:43.851 --> 34:45.478
It was me.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.190
I killed Emilio.

34:50.984 --> 34:53.527
No. No, you didn't.

34:54.571 --> 34:59.784
I know you want to protect your son
but you didn't kill your husband.

35:00.327 --> 35:01.369
Cameron did.

35:02.245 --> 35:05.123
The clothes we dug up
were Cameron's.

35:05.749 --> 35:08.835
Had blood from him and his father
all over them.

35:11.963 --> 35:14.758
He killed his father to
protect you, didn't he?

35:15.800 --> 35:16.634
Stop it!
Stop it!

35:33.610 --> 35:37.781
That same night you and Cameron
dragged his body to the river.

35:51.378 --> 35:54.381
When Cameron needed to talk to
someone about what he'd done...

35:55.215 --> 35:57.133
he went to
see Father Carlos.

35:57.133 --> 35:58.677
You need to tell the police.

35:58.677 --> 35:59.552
No!

35:59.552 --> 36:01.805
Come with me to the police.
Let me help you.

36:01.805 --> 36:03.848
No! Get away from me!

36:03.848 --> 36:05.308
Cameron, wait!

36:05.308 --> 36:08.353
When you dropped Cameron off
at Ollie Oop Skate Park...

36:08.353 --> 36:11.773
he told you Father
Carlos would tell the police.

36:11.773 --> 36:13.942
So, you went back to the rectory ...

36:14.567 --> 36:15.610
to kill him.

36:15.610 --> 36:18.071
Promise me you won't tell the police.

36:18.071 --> 36:19.906
They'll understand.

36:19.906 --> 36:24.577
No one understands --
not you, not God -- no one.

36:24.577 --> 36:26.788
I gave up.

36:29.708 --> 36:34.921
I-I left and I went back
to the truck.

36:46.224 --> 36:47.434
Iris.

36:47.434 --> 36:49.227
My son protected me.

36:50.270 --> 36:53.398
I'm the only one who can
protect him now.

37:00.322 --> 37:01.364
Iris.

37:06.786 --> 37:10.415
You knew what he was doing to me.
You knew!

37:10.415 --> 37:13.960
It's not my place to judge.

37:13.960 --> 37:17.088
But you gave him communion
every Sunday!

37:38.526 --> 37:40.403
Jeffrey, you lied to me...

37:40.403 --> 37:44.574
about the last time you saw Lisa. You just
saw her three days ago, didn't you?

37:46.868 --> 37:50.914
Did you know that she had family that
thought she was still alive, Jeffrey,

37:50.914 --> 37:53.708
until I was forced to tell them
that she was dead?

37:54.084 --> 37:59.297
Do you have anything more than your opinion
and my client's itinerary to hold him on?

38:01.383 --> 38:02.467
Let's go.

38:02.884 --> 38:04.636
You mean like his DNA?

38:06.721 --> 38:10.892
Jeffrey is the baby's father,
so sit down.

38:13.937 --> 38:20.193
See, I think this is about the baby and how you
didn't want the baby to cramp your style so,

38:20.193 --> 38:24.364
you force-fed Lisa Marie enough
demerol to kill her. Am I close?

38:24.364 --> 38:27.117
No. But now you're done.

38:28.785 --> 38:29.869
Before you go ...

38:31.538 --> 38:32.580
I wanted to...

38:33.790 --> 38:34.833
show you ...

38:35.875 --> 38:37.127
a photograph.

38:38.086 --> 38:40.296
Take a look at that.
Do you know who that is?

38:40.296 --> 38:42.173
That's your daughter.

38:42.173 --> 38:45.552
This is what she would have looked like on
her second birthday had you not killed...

38:45.552 --> 38:47.637
her and her mother.

38:48.555 --> 38:50.223
Know this, my friend.

38:50.223 --> 38:53.685
Every year on this child's birthday
I am going to haunt you.

38:53.685 --> 38:57.981
I am going to be all over you till I get
what I need to put you in jail.

38:57.981 --> 38:59.065
Understand?

39:00.233 --> 39:02.319
Do you understand what I'm saying?
