00:10.427 --> 00:14.625
In the Greater Seattle area,
the number is 555-KACL.

00:14.973 --> 00:18.363
Lines are open. Please give us a call.
Who's up next, Roz?

00:18.685 --> 00:21.995
Pam on line four has a family problem.

00:22.313 --> 00:26.226
Hello, Pam.
This is Dr Frasier Crane. I'm listening.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.763
'Hi. It's my in-laws.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.987
'They drop over all the time
without calling

00:32.281 --> 00:35.035
'and expect us to stop
and entertain them.'

00:35.326 --> 00:38.841
They're your husband's parents.
What does he suggest?

00:39.164 --> 00:41.837
'The other day
he had us drop to the floor

00:42.125 --> 00:45.162
'and stay quiet until they drove away.'

00:45.462 --> 00:49.933
A creative approach,
but hardly a long-term solution.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.734
'l don't want to hurt their feelings.'

00:53.011 --> 00:55.764
Either you risk hurting their feelings,

00:56.056 --> 01:00.732
or you spend the rest of your life
diving for cover when they drop on by.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.501
(Doorbell)

01:02.729 --> 01:04.799
'Shh! They're here!'

01:05.940 --> 01:07.692
Your in-laws?

01:07.984 --> 01:11.181
- 'Shh! Yes.'
- (Whispers) Then why don't you...

01:11.488 --> 01:14.605
Oh, for Pete's sake!
Just tell them how you feel.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.914
'l will. Next time. I promise. Thanks.'

01:20.705 --> 01:25.221
As Pam belly-crawls
across her living room...

01:25.585 --> 01:30.022
let's take a moment
for this message from Carpet Fresh.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.418
How's that for a segue?

01:37.806 --> 01:41.116
It's not good to make rude gestures
at other drivers.

01:41.434 --> 01:42.583
He cut you off.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.769
You should not antagonise a man

01:46.064 --> 01:51.013
whose bumper sticker says "lf you're
close enough to read this, I'll kill you."

01:51.611 --> 01:54.125
Big talk from a Volvo.

01:54.406 --> 01:58.160
- You found yourself a new suit.
- It's a beaut.

01:58.493 --> 02:02.372
- Let's have a look.
- I'll model it for you.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.664
Nice of you to buy
your father a new suit.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.348
It didn't work out
the way I'd planned but...

02:08.627 --> 02:10.584
What are you doing?

02:10.839 --> 02:13.512
Fluffing your knickers.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.590
If you don't mind my saying so,
you're losing some of your elasticity.

02:18.972 --> 02:23.170
I appreciate what you're doing,
but a man's knickers are...

02:24.561 --> 02:26.313
Ooh!

02:27.647 --> 02:30.002
How do you get them so soft?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.869
Fabric softener
and twice in the fluff cycle.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.791
Keep up the good work.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.463
(Phone rings)

02:36.698 --> 02:38.973
Hello? Yes. Oh, hi, Niles.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.996
Of course you can come by.
Great. I'll see you then.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.670
Hi, Niles.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.911
Thanks for calling first.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.129
I heard your show today.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.216
I wouldn't dream
of popping by unannounced.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.344
I was passing by
and I've come to beg a favour.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.790
My housekeeper Mary is a fan
of your little radio programme.

03:05.101 --> 03:09.333
What she lacks in taste,
she makes up for in vigour.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.725
She'd like an autographed photo.

03:11.983 --> 03:15.862
It'd be my pleasure.
Daphne, this is my brother Niles.

03:18.490 --> 03:21.050
- You're Daphne?
- Yes, I am.

03:21.326 --> 03:24.716
When Frasier told me
he'd hired an English woman,

03:25.038 --> 03:28.394
I pictured someone a little more...
not quite so...

03:29.751 --> 03:31.264
You're Daphne?

03:31.503 --> 03:33.619
Nice to meet you.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.077
- Lovely accent. Manchester?
- How did you know?

03:37.384 --> 03:40.660
I'm quite the Anglophile.
I'm sure Frasier and Dad told you.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.120
No.

03:43.390 --> 03:46.348
I spent a year studying at Cambridge.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.919
They didn't mention that either.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.461
I guess they don't talk about me
when I'm not around.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.608
I wouldn't say that.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.997
Niles, here's your picture.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.272
Do you mind?

04:03.410 --> 04:07.164
"Mary, here's wishing you
good mental health. Frasier Crane."

04:10.625 --> 04:13.583
Fits like a glove. Hi, Niles.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.471
Hey, Dad... Wow.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.882
- How do I look?
- Wow.

04:22.595 --> 04:25.428
Dr Crane took your father to Armani.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.680
That's Armani?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.607
I told you, Frasier.
He can't tell the difference.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.854
We were on our way to Armani

04:36.109 --> 04:38.987
when Dad spotted this
at a discount store.

04:39.279 --> 04:44.273
It's sharkskin. Look at the way it
changes colour when I move my arm.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.208
You'll be the handsomest gent
at your friend's retirement party.

04:48.538 --> 04:52.656
- Let's hang it up before it gets wrinkled.
- It's supposed to resist wrinkles.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.710
They had one in the window
wadded up inside a mayonnaise jar.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.230
Frasier, is he our real father?

05:02.510 --> 05:06.139
We've been having this discussion
since we were children.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.466
But that suit!

05:10.727 --> 05:14.925
It's not just the suit. It's his taste
in everything - clothing, films, music.

05:15.398 --> 05:20.347
Except our surname and strong calves
we have nothing in common with him.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.126
Thank goodness, we took after Mom.

05:23.406 --> 05:26.204
Why didn't he acquire
her sophistication?

05:26.493 --> 05:30.406
He was too busy working
so we could have the nicer things.

05:30.747 --> 05:34.456
Maybe we should pay him back
in some way,

05:34.793 --> 05:37.148
expose him to the finer things

05:37.420 --> 05:43.052
so that he'd stop lumbering through life
like some great polyester dinosaur.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.663
Dad's so set in his ways.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.080
We all are at some point.
You thought the 1812 Overture

05:49.391 --> 05:51.347
was great classical music.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.990
Was I ever that young?

05:58.608 --> 06:01.998
You and l
have to broaden Dad's horizons,

06:02.320 --> 06:06.632
show him the world that
he's only read about in TV Guide.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.381
- How about an evening of fine dining?
- Perfect. But where?

06:11.579 --> 06:13.729
Le Cigare Volant!

06:15.500 --> 06:18.253
Can we get in?
I've been trying for months.

06:18.545 --> 06:21.184
My name carries cachet in this town.

06:21.464 --> 06:25.616
If the maÃ®tre d'
happens to be a housewife, we're in.

06:27.762 --> 06:30.560
Niles, you are so mean.

06:30.849 --> 06:35.127
- I'll just call Information.
- No need. I have it on speed dial.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.495
Thank you.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.926
Hello. This is Dr Frasier Crane.

06:40.191 --> 06:42.307
Yes. The one on the radio.

06:42.861 --> 06:48.174
Any chance of getting a table
for four on Saturday, at, say, 8:00?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.555
Merci. A bientÃ´t!

06:51.828 --> 06:53.819
We're in!

06:54.539 --> 06:56.894
Niles, can I get you a beer, pork rinds?

06:57.167 --> 06:58.998
No, thanks.

06:59.252 --> 07:04.372
Dad, Niles and I and Maris
would like you to join us for dinner

07:04.758 --> 07:09.274
on Saturday night at Le Cigare Volant,
one of the hottest new restaurants.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.389
I don't know.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.595
The food is to die for.

07:13.850 --> 07:17.729
Your country and your family
are to die for. Food is to eat.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.054
Thanks, but I wouldn't like it.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.306
How do you know?

07:22.567 --> 07:26.606
I didn't have to get shot in the hip
to know I wouldn't like that.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.336
It's a chance to have an evening
together as a family.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.013
We really want to do this for you.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.796
All right.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.592
We're going to have the best time!

07:39.876 --> 07:42.595
I can wear my new suit.

07:43.213 --> 07:46.011
And won't that be nice?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.629
How do the calls look today?

07:50.887 --> 07:54.163
Jilted lovers,
a man who's afraid of his car,

07:54.516 --> 07:57.474
a manic-depressive and the rest
feel their lives are going nowhere.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.478
I love a Monday.
How was your weekend?

08:01.815 --> 08:04.375
I had my most hellacious date ever.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.960
He asked me to pick him up from work.

08:07.237 --> 08:11.025
I stop for gas and pump it myself
while he reads the sports section.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.802
We go to my place
to make sweet and sour shrimp.

08:15.120 --> 08:19.398
I ask him to hand me the honey
and he gets this freaked out look

08:19.749 --> 08:24.027
and says he can't because he has
a fear of touching anything sticky.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.142
It was a new jar,
but he wasn't taking risks.

08:29.426 --> 08:33.544
- Where do you meet these people?
- I answered his ad.

08:35.932 --> 08:39.845
- You got 30 seconds. Get in there.
- Not yet. Are you ready?

08:40.186 --> 08:42.620
- Oh, no.
- We do this every Monday.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.737
- You do this. I play along.
- Come on.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.189
- Who's got the best Seattle talk show?
- We do! We do!

08:50.488 --> 08:52.479
All right!

08:54.000 --> 09:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:03.877 --> 09:06.596
Well, aren't you a bobby-dazzler!

09:06.921 --> 09:10.197
I'll go out on a limb
and take that as a compliment.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.543
- Where are you off to?
- Poker night.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.359
You're a card player?

09:16.598 --> 09:17.747
(Doorbell)

09:17.974 --> 09:21.887
It's mostly social.
Me and the girls just bumping the gums.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.941
No one ever loses
more than $500 or $600.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.982
Hi, Niles. Where's Maris?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.386
Are you taking
separate elevators again?

09:32.655 --> 09:35.169
Maris is having one of her episodes.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.566
In the middle of dressing
for the evening,

09:37.827 --> 09:41.820
she suddenly slumped down on the bed
in her half-slip and sighed.

09:42.165 --> 09:45.237
- I knew that dinner was not to be.
- Sorry.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.582
I'll make the best of it.
Hi-ho, Daphne, you're looking luminous.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.644
- Thank you.
- What's in the bag?

09:55.011 --> 09:58.560
A little treat for Dad.
Some Devonshire clotted cream.

09:58.890 --> 10:02.803
- For Dad?
- I love Devonshire clotted cream.

10:03.144 --> 10:07.501
- Isn't that lucky? You can share it.
- I'll pop it in the fridge.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.213
- Sherry, Niles?
- Thank you.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.443
I'm having a thought.

10:14.698 --> 10:17.371
Since Maris has dropped out
and we have an extra space,

10:17.659 --> 10:20.332
perhaps we should invite Daphne
to join us.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.498
It is a table for four,

10:23.790 --> 10:28.466
and three is such an awkward number,
you know, at a...at a dinner.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.617
What are you doing?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.272
Nothing.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.105
For goodness' sake,
I'm happily married.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.186
Maris means the world to me.

10:41.433 --> 10:45.472
The other day, I kissed her
for no reason whatsoever.

10:46.646 --> 10:51.276
I'm off to my poker game.
It was nice seeing you again, Dr Crane.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.927
Wait a minute.
I'm getting something on you.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.949
She's psychic.
We've decided to find it charming.

11:05.498 --> 11:09.650
You have occasional bouts of colitis,
don't you?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.231
Yes.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.333
Frasier, she's phenomenal!

11:17.594 --> 11:20.062
It's a gift. Well, cheerio.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.860
Ta-ta.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.054
You've never had colitis!

11:24.309 --> 11:26.948
I know.
I couldn't bear to disappoint her.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.502
OK. I'm ready to go.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.335
Dad, what's happened to your suit?

11:34.611 --> 11:38.570
It's at the cleaners. I got some creamed
chicken on it at Phil's retirement dinner.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.296
You can't keep anything nice.

11:41.576 --> 11:45.330
I'm sure Le Cigare Volant
has a dress code.

11:45.664 --> 11:49.100
Niles, may I borrow your phone?
Thank you.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.250
- Where's Maris?
- Episode.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.489
Hello. This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I have a reservation tonight

11:56.800 --> 12:00.759
and I'm calling to inquire
about your minimum dress code.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.958
Crane. Frasier... Doctor.

12:07.268 --> 12:11.227
What do you mean?
They've lost our reservation.

12:11.564 --> 12:16.399
Give me that. This is Dr Niles Crane.
I've never been treated so shabbily.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.973
I could come over and create a scene!

12:19.280 --> 12:22.272
- They've already hung up.
- Thank God.

12:25.203 --> 12:30.072
What now? It's Saturday night, 7:45.
We won't get in anywhere.

12:30.458 --> 12:35.612
Hey, I know! Why don't I take us all
to The Timber Mill?

12:36.006 --> 12:40.557
- The Timber Mill?
- You get a steak this thick for $8.95!

12:40.927 --> 12:44.715
It doesn't sound like
the kind of restaurant we'd like.

12:45.056 --> 12:50.210
- I was willing to go to your place.
- We'd better take a rain check.

12:50.645 --> 12:55.765
I was looking forward to going out with
you boys. We'll do it some other time.

12:56.151 --> 13:00.144
I'm sure Daphne's got something
in the fridge I can heat up.

13:05.201 --> 13:09.399
- I'm in the mood for a good steak.
- What?

13:11.249 --> 13:17.085
The point isn't where we have dinner
but that we have an evening together.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.975
You won't be sorry. They've got
five toppings for your baked potato.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.054
- Did you hear that, Niles?
- I'm sold.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.541
We'll bring you a bone, Eddie.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.239
He's ecstatic.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.957
Quite a place, huh?
Used to be a sawmill.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.346
Until somebody stated the obvious

13:40.612 --> 13:43.729
and said,
"Hey, let's turn it into a restaurant!"

13:44.866 --> 13:46.822
My mouth is watering.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.545
There's nothing like
the smell of charbroiled meat.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.458
This aroma is triggering
a sense memory. Something familiar.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.985
Oh, of course.
It's Maris and her home tanning bed.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.910
Welcome to The Timber Mill.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.451
Do you have a table for three?

14:05.762 --> 14:08.435
Sure. This way.

14:08.723 --> 14:11.874
- Is this your first visit here?
- Yes.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.141
We've got a dress code.

14:14.396 --> 14:19.072
- His suit was at the cleaners.
- Not him. You.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.370
Timber!

14:22.654 --> 14:24.451
(Bell rings)

14:24.698 --> 14:29.135
- My tie! She cut off my tie!
- Isn't that great?

14:29.494 --> 14:33.646
- Why did she do that?
- They like to keep the place casual.

14:34.040 --> 14:39.512
- You could have mentioned that to us.
- And spoil the fun? Ah, cheer up.

14:39.921 --> 14:43.152
- You get a free dessert.
- Oh, boy.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.185
I guess you're right, Dad. It's just a tie.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.983
A Hugo Boss tie.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.971
- Can I get you something from the bar?
- Oh, dear God, yes.

14:56.354 --> 15:00.393
Stoli Gibson on the rocks
with three pearl onions.

15:00.734 --> 15:04.693
If you bring him two or four,
he'll send it back.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.498
- And for you?
- The same.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.977
I'll have a Ballantine.

15:11.995 --> 15:16.989
A funny thing happened the other day.
One of my patients had a Freudian slip.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.845
He was with his wife
and meant to say, "Pass the salt."

15:21.171 --> 15:25.130
Instead he said, "You've ruined my life,
you blood-sucking shrew."

15:29.095 --> 15:31.814
I'll bet she didn't like that.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.336
No, Dad. She didn't.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.955
How was your buddy's
retirement party?

15:40.231 --> 15:44.941
It was great. I really miss those guys.
Bad news, though.

15:45.320 --> 15:50.678
Mo Hanson, my old desk captain,
was killed in a boating accident.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.304
I'm sorry.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.526
At least he went quick.

15:54.788 --> 15:59.737
Hank Krinski, well, he had three
bypasses before he went.

16:00.126 --> 16:04.358
Jimmy Berman had this weird disease.
I visited him in the hospital.

16:04.714 --> 16:09.310
When he died, his skin was all yellow.
Just wasted away to nothing.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.954
Nice nurse, though.
Betty, I think her name was.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.350
I see you're first-timers.
This is how it works.

16:18.687 --> 16:23.920
Every entrÃ©e comes with soup or a trip
to the salad bar. One trip only, please.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.785
Also included
is our garlic cheese bread.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.619
- Now you can claim your steaks.
- "Claim" them?

16:30.949 --> 16:34.988
You get to pick the cut you want
off the beef trolley.

16:39.791 --> 16:44.546
How much extra would I have to pay
to get one from the refrigerator?

16:46.131 --> 16:48.326
Just pick your steak.

16:48.591 --> 16:53.984
I'd like a petit fillet mignon very lean,
but not so lean that it lacks flavour.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.128
And I don't want it cooked,
just lightly seared.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.391
Pink in the middle. Not true pink,

17:00.645 --> 17:03.443
but not a mauve.
Something in between,

17:03.732 --> 17:07.724
bearing in mind the slightest error
either way, and it's ruined.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.707
OK.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.280
How about you?

17:15.910 --> 17:19.107
Could I see the other side of that one?

17:19.414 --> 17:23.373
Just bring us those three, medium rare,
all the fixings.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.588
Come on. There's a lull at the salad bar.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.794
They have the best
Thousand Island dressing in town.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.975
I saw the plaque by the cash register.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.383
Here we go. Three Paul Bunyans.

17:41.644 --> 17:45.159
- We've barely touched our salads.
- Great service.

17:45.482 --> 17:49.316
With luck, we'll complete
our dining experience in 20 minutes.

17:49.652 --> 17:54.407
- I could put this under the heat lamp.
- No, no. I'm as ready as I'll ever be.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.457
Let me know
if I can get you anything else.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.417
Thank you (!)

18:00.664 --> 18:02.620
I don't mind you being tough
on this place,

18:02.874 --> 18:04.990
but you could be nicer to the waitress.

18:05.251 --> 18:11.008
I'll apologise when she comes with the
dessert. Which should be any time now.

18:13.051 --> 18:16.839
Sometimes there's nothing
like a good steak.

18:17.180 --> 18:20.092
I wish this was one of those times.

18:20.558 --> 18:22.116
What's wrong?

18:22.352 --> 18:25.185
- I don't mean to complain...
- Then don't.

18:25.480 --> 18:30.395
These steaks come from prize beef...
What the hell are you doing?

18:30.777 --> 18:33.689
Something's fallen in my potato.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.741
- Those are bacon bits.
- I didn't ask for them.

18:37.033 --> 18:40.946
- I ordered all the fixings.
- I don't eat bacon. It has nitrates.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.596
They're artificial.
They're made out of soy.

18:43.873 --> 18:46.341
They really
look out for your health here.

18:48.211 --> 18:52.250
Everybody in this restaurant is enjoying
the dinner. Can't you do the same?

18:58.638 --> 19:00.515
Niles?

19:00.765 --> 19:06.681
Is Maris organising the...Arts Council
benefit again this year?

19:07.105 --> 19:10.381
- Yes.
- Where are they holding it?

19:10.692 --> 19:14.480
They haven't picked a spot yet. Maybe
I should tell them about this place.

19:19.492 --> 19:23.770
- I'd like to be a fly on the wall that night.
- You wouldn't be the only one.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.469
That's it. I've had enough
of you two jackasses.

19:29.794 --> 19:33.025
I've listened to you making cracks
about the food.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.538
I've got news for you.
People like this place. I like this place.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.037
When you insult this restaurant,
you insult me.

19:41.348 --> 19:45.307
I thought you took after your mother,
liking the ballet and all that.

19:45.643 --> 19:49.682
But you mother liked a ball game too.
She'd even have a hot dog.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.140
She had fancy taste,
but she had too much class

19:53.443 --> 19:55.479
to make anyone feel second-rate.

19:55.737 --> 19:59.889
If she saw how you've behaved tonight,
she'd be ashamed. I know I am.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.950
- Dad, wait.
- I'm going to Duke's for a nightcap.

20:04.245 --> 20:08.363
- Let us take you.
- I'll take a cab. I've had enough of you.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.303
Leave the waitress a good tip.
She deserves it.

20:12.629 --> 20:16.258
- Niles, say something.
- Dad, wait.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.822
The mud pie is coming!

20:29.104 --> 20:31.743
The mud pie is coming (!)

20:37.278 --> 20:39.269
- I feel terrible.
- So do I.

20:39.531 --> 20:43.604
- The sad thing is, he's right about us.
- Are we really such snobs?

20:43.952 --> 20:48.104
Do you see anyone else drive
their father out into the street to drink?

20:57.507 --> 21:00.783
- We've got to apologise to Dad.
- You're right.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.723
Give him a couple of hours.
When he gets home, we'll settle this.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.048
Absolutely. We've been just horrid.

21:08.351 --> 21:12.788
Do you think we've lost the ability
to appreciate the simple things -

21:13.148 --> 21:15.423
steak, potatoes, fixings?

21:18.319 --> 21:20.469
I'm afraid so.

21:20.739 --> 21:23.333
The thing is, this is good food.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.370
It's not fancy but
it's good, wholesome American fare.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.934
You know, as a tribute to Dad,

21:30.206 --> 21:33.039
we should
sit here until we've cleaned our plates.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.410
I'm game if you are.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.269
We're going to prove we are not snobs.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.385
Absolutely.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.125
Frasier, look who's here.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.393
Eat your food.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.790
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.547 --> 22:20.946
# Quite stylish

22:21.174 --> 22:26.009
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:28.306 --> 22:33.061
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:34.145 --> 22:36.215
# They're calling again #

22:36.481 --> 22:39.359
Frasier has left the building.
