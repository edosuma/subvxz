I don't need school.

18:06.931 --> 18:08.197
Sensei Tom's a loser.

He lives above his dojo

18:09.934 --> 18:12.935

Thanks, Steve.

Your love made me realize
that anger isn't all I am.

19:28.246 --> 19:30.713
And instead
of using my anger to fight,

19:30.715 --> 19:33.049
I should bottle it up
and only let it out

Uh, what could it be?
Maybe a giant aquarium?

Maybe it's a lifetime supply
