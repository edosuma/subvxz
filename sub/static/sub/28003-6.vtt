removed from the equation to assure
that their event happens as it should.

like there's less of me.

is a huge accomplishment.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.502
You did it all by yourself.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.088
So it's the right thing to invite them
to the concert.

09:49.171 --> 09:51.382
They need to see
how talented you are, okay?

10:46.812 --> 10:47.688
What's going on?

10:50.608 --> 10:51.942
It's a family matter.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.028
[Vanya] A family matter.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.324
-So you couldn't bother to include me.
-No, it's not like that. We were--

10:58.407 --> 11:00.201
-Don't let me interrupt.
-[Allison] Wait.

11:00.284 --> 11:03.496
-I'll fill you in later when we're alone.
-Please, please, don't bother.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.664
And I won't either.

-Vanya, that's not fair.
-Fair?

11:09.585 --> 11:11.712
There's nothing fair
about being your sister.

11:12.755 --> 11:16.342
I have been left out of everything
for as long as I can remember.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.513
And I used to think it was Dad's fault,
but he's dead.

So it turns out you're the assholes.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.479
[Klaus] Ouch.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.941
Vanya, wait. I left my jacket.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.567
I can't go back there.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.444
Okay, go ahead, I'll catch up to you.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.574
-I'm gonna go find Vanya and explain.
-No, wait, there isn't time.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.868
We need to figure out
what causes the apocalypse.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.746
-[door closes]
-Now, there are loads of possibilities.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.832
Nuclear war, asteroids.

11:47.915 --> 11:50.668
But I'm thinking this is about the Moon.
Right?

11:51.252 --> 11:53.170
Dad must have sent me up there
for a reason.

11:53.295 --> 11:57.633
And I was giving him daily updates
on the conditions, I sent field samples.

11:58.092 --> 11:59.218
The first thing we need to do

11:59.510 --> 12:01.929
-is find his research.
-Hold on. Hold the phone.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.808
We all died fighting this thing
the first time around. Remember?

12:06.100 --> 12:08.936
Klaus, shockingly, has a point.
What gives us a win this time?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.856
-Five. Last time we didn't have him.
-[gagging]

-We weren't all together.

[Luther] This time,
we'll have the full force

12:15.317 --> 12:17.111
of the Umbrella Academy.
That's what we need.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.654
So, where's Five now?

12:19.238 --> 12:22.658
[Luther] Well, he had a plan to change
the time line. He'll be back soon.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.368
[Diego] I'm going after Hazel and Cha-Cha.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.370
-What, right now?
-Hell, yeah.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.080
Three days.
I'm losing light by the minute.

12:28.164 --> 12:28.998
[Luther] Wait, Diego.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.791
Look,
I know you wanna avenge your friend,

12:30.875 --> 12:33.627
-but we got a bigger problem here.
-[Diego] She wasn't just some friend.

12:35.337 --> 12:38.549
If I'm gonna die, I need to know
I killed those bastards first.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.719
-You don't look so hot.
-[Diego] It's not about Dad.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.722
-It's not about me.
-What makes you say that? I feel great.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.767
-[Diego] The longer I wait, Hazel...
-You don't have to do this alone.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.311
-I know how important this is to you.
-[Diego] Stop making it about you.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.522
-[sighs]
-Klaus?

12:54.565 --> 12:55.399
Klaus?

12:55.775 --> 12:57.526
-Klaus!
-Yeah! Sorry.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.737
So, what?
You're giving up on the world, too?

13:00.154 --> 13:02.948
Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.533
So that's it.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.661
You're cool with us all dying
in three days?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.998
[groans]

13:12.917 --> 13:14.084
I can't believe it.

13:16.295 --> 13:17.213
It's just us.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.386
Oh, please, not you, too.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.555
I have to book a flight back to LA.

13:27.264 --> 13:30.476
If this happens I have to be
with my daughter, custody be damned.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.061
And you said it yourself...

13:33.187 --> 13:37.191
we need the full force of the Academy
to even stand a chance.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.736
I'm sorry, Luther.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.121
[thunder rumbles]

13:51.539 --> 13:54.166
[Vanya] I can't believe
I was stupid enough to go back there.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.459
[Leonard] I shouldn't have made you do it.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.836
No, it's my fault.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.630
-[metal creaking]
-I just wanted them to be proud of me.

13:59.713 --> 14:03.425
And how could I presume
to be worthy of their attention?

14:03.509 --> 14:06.178
Nothing's ever big enough
next to their holier-than-thou,

14:06.262 --> 14:08.055
-weight of the world bullshit.
-[crashing]

14:08.138 --> 14:09.390
-Vanya!
-What?

14:09.473 --> 14:14.144
-[car alarms wailing]
-[horns blaring]

14:21.193 --> 14:22.570
What the hell is happening?

14:23.320 --> 14:24.947
<i>You </i>happened.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.782
Oh, come on.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.451
Th-- That's crazy.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.829
I mean, it-- it was like this before.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.042
That's a coincidence.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.005
-[scoffs]
-Leonard, it's impossible.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.008
Come on. My place is close.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.436
Ah, shit. [groans]

14:55.811 --> 14:59.189
-Hey.
-Hey. You, uh... you mind?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.443
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
I'll... I'll tie that up.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.945
If you tie me up after.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.405
Come again?

15:06.488 --> 15:09.617
You know, last time I was sober
was that roaring good time

15:09.742 --> 15:11.952
when those freaks had me tied up
in the motel room.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.288
Wow. You are one twisted bonehead.

15:14.371 --> 15:18.000
Why? You're the one who's always like,
"Klaus, you need to get sober, bro."

15:18.083 --> 15:20.920
-There's better ways to get clean, bro.
-[Klaus] Not for me, no.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.965
I need someone to take away my options.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.051
-Fine.
-Okay. Thank you.

15:27.134 --> 15:29.887
-Okay, can you help me?
-Yeah. Yeah.

15:31.764 --> 15:32.598
Okay.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.731
Hiya, Five. How's it going?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.484
I must have utter silence
in order to complete this task.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.860
[stammers] Oh, okay.

15:48.530 --> 15:52.576
Hey, a few of us are having lunch,
and I was wondering if you...

15:53.160 --> 15:55.621
-[clears throat]
-...you're doing something.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.255
Oh. Bye-- Bye!

16:18.686 --> 16:20.437
I'm afraid that's not procedure.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.776
Five, meet Gloria.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.447
Gloria is perhaps the single
most vital cog in our machine.

16:30.531 --> 16:33.784
-Oh! [chuckles]
-Gloria, this is Number Five.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.869
Look at you.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.371
Deadly little thing.

16:38.497 --> 16:43.585
So happy we decided to close
the contract on your life. [chuckles]

16:43.877 --> 16:46.005
I'm afraid your reputation precedes you.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.590
And it looks like you're building on it
here.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.219
Oh. Karl Weber.

16:52.803 --> 16:56.765
Now tell me, why unfortunate Karl?

16:57.099 --> 17:00.477
Karl Weber is the butcher at the shop
where Captain Ernst A. Lehmann

17:00.561 --> 17:01.854
acquires his weekly roast.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.774
So, if Karl dies, his butcher shop
is passed on to his son Otto, who...

17:06.400 --> 17:08.360
never washes his hands,
which is disgusting.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.196
So he's the one
who gives the captain his roast.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.656
And that gives him food poisoning.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.241
Which makes him late for work.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.368
Which delays the takeoff.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.120
And to make up for lost time,

17:18.203 --> 17:19.872
the <i>Hindenburg </i>flies
through a weather front

17:19.955 --> 17:21.582
of high electrical charge and humidity.

17:21.665 --> 17:25.753
And the static electricity inside
the aircraft makes it a virtual tinderbox.

17:26.253 --> 17:27.671
Tiny engine sparks...

17:27.755 --> 17:30.132
And just like that, we have...

17:31.258 --> 17:32.760
[mimics explosion]

17:32.843 --> 17:34.636
-Oh! [mimics explosion]
-[Handler laughs]

17:35.846 --> 17:40.350
I'm sure you've all heard
that Mr. Five has proven

17:40.434 --> 17:44.646
to be as adept with a pen
as he was with a sword.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.027
Let his effort serve as inspiration

17:50.402 --> 17:51.570
to you all.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.364
Herb! How long have you been
on the Lusitania?

17:54.948 --> 17:58.285
-Oh, ah... Well, let's see, I, uh... I...
-Sorry?

17:58.410 --> 18:00.537
-When I first started...
-Sorry? I can't hear you.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.539
-Still can't hear you.
-[buzzer sounds]

18:03.290 --> 18:04.291
[indistinct chatter]

18:04.958 --> 18:07.795
[Handler] Oh, Gene,
a word before you go to lunch.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.173
Gutenberg seems to be having
second thoughts about the printing press.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.976
-[Five sighs]
-[lock clicks]

18:26.230 --> 18:27.272
[door opens]
Shit.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.276
-[door closes]
-[Handler] So, how's your first day going?

18:32.277 --> 18:33.320
Couldn't be better.

18:35.197 --> 18:40.244
-[Handler] Glad to hear it. [coughing]
-[urinating]

18:41.537 --> 18:42.579
[coughs loudly]

18:44.123 --> 18:44.957
Ah.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.708
I burned my rugae.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.253
Ever burn your rugae?

18:49.336 --> 18:50.629
[continues urinating]

18:50.712 --> 18:52.422
-Rugae.
-[sighs]

18:52.798 --> 18:56.760
[Handler] The ridges on the hard palate
that help pass food to the esophagus.

18:56.927 --> 19:01.348
Anyway, I'm on a liquid diet for two days,
hence the marathon of urination.

19:01.723 --> 19:05.102
One faulty cog,
and nothing works as it should.

19:06.019 --> 19:11.525
You know, we value integrity
at the office above all else.

19:12.109 --> 19:16.613
Trust is essential,
and that trust is... built over time.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.991
But in the event of a breach,

19:19.074 --> 19:22.744
the Commission will act swiftly
and without mercy.

19:22.995 --> 19:27.708
An efficiency I'm sure you above
all people can appreciate, Number Five.

19:27.791 --> 19:29.418
[toilet flushes]

19:29.501 --> 19:31.295
[Handler] I'm feeling peckish.

19:31.378 --> 19:32.713
Have you had your lunch?

19:34.298 --> 19:35.340
Not yet.

19:35.424 --> 19:39.386
[Handler] Great. How would you like
to lunch with me in my office?

19:39.970 --> 19:43.891
You can eat solid foods,
and I can live vicariously...

19:44.683 --> 19:45.559
through you.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.854
Sounds great.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.440
[motor sputtering]

20:10.250 --> 20:14.296
-The briefcase is here?
-[Cha-Cha] It's where Commission said.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.217
All righty.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.728
[gun cocks]

20:38.487 --> 20:40.113
[birds singing]

20:44.368 --> 20:45.619
[woodpecker pecking]

20:45.702 --> 20:47.496
[Hazel] Sure are in the middle of nowhere.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.252
[clicking]

20:53.335 --> 20:55.754
-[Cha-Cha] What are you doing?
-[Hazel] Just tying my shoe.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.589
[click]

21:02.678 --> 21:05.138
Can I ask you a cuckoo bananas question?

21:05.555 --> 21:06.515
Sure, shoot.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.809
Would it really be so bad...

21:10.352 --> 21:12.896
-if we didn't find the briefcase?
-[Cha-Cha] Uh, yeah.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.107
You know what happens
to people who step out of line.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.317
We'd be hunted down like dogs.
What's the matter with you?

21:17.401 --> 21:20.696
[Hazel] I guess I'm just tired of all this
being told what to do, where to go.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.073
Wouldn't it be nice
to kill who you want for a change,

21:23.156 --> 21:24.658
not who the Commission tells us to?

21:25.701 --> 21:27.661
Let's forget the stupid briefcase.

21:28.829 --> 21:30.163
Why not just stay here?

21:30.247 --> 21:33.083
In case it fell out of your head,
there won't be a "here" in a few days.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.876
Well, then, maybe we should help stop it.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.461
-Stop what?
-[Hazel] You know.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.588
-[faint boom]
-[Cha-Cha] That's impossible.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.300
-[Hazel] Why? Number Five came back.
-And he failed.

21:41.383 --> 21:44.428
He's back at the Commission.
There's no way around this, Hazel.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.889
Our only choice is to do what they say.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.268
One way or another, they always get you.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.356
-[loud blast]
-[engine sputters]

22:11.330 --> 22:12.748
Home sweet home.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.417
Yep.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.388
Hey, uh...

22:29.389 --> 22:31.350
-You hungry?
-I could eat.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.976
Why don't you go relax?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.811
I'll bring us some, uh, takeout.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.689
That, uh, Chinese place, Samurai Gardens.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.983
Kung Pao chicken, extra spicy.

22:41.693 --> 22:43.445
Okay. Sounds great.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.072
Thanks.

22:45.489 --> 22:46.323
Great.

22:47.032 --> 22:48.075
Back in a jiff.

22:48.241 --> 22:50.619
-Uh, keys.
-[keys jangle]

22:55.832 --> 22:57.834
[engine starts]
[car pulls away]

23:07.344 --> 23:08.387
[grunts]

23:12.140 --> 23:13.266
[panting]

23:19.898 --> 23:21.650
Everything all right, Master Luther?

23:22.692 --> 23:23.693
Where are they?

23:24.444 --> 23:26.530
The boxes, the reports, the samples?

23:26.613 --> 23:28.532
All the correspondence
I sent down from the Moon?

23:29.241 --> 23:31.493
I, uh... I'm not sure.

23:31.576 --> 23:34.955
-Your father was a very private person--
-[Luther] Stop it, Pogo!

23:35.914 --> 23:37.666
You know everything our dad did.

23:43.797 --> 23:44.631
What?

23:45.841 --> 23:46.758
[creaking]

23:50.095 --> 23:51.304
Clever old man.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.623
He never even looked at them.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.627
Why not?

24:25.505 --> 24:26.465
[yelling] Why not?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.843
Your father was many things.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.803
Forthright was not one of them.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.306
After your accident,

24:34.806 --> 24:37.267
he wanted to give you purpose,
Master Luther.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.228
He felt that this was the only way.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.898
What? Shanghaiing me on the Moon
for four years?

24:45.609 --> 24:47.444
I wasn't a good enough Number One?

24:48.278 --> 24:49.279
That's what it was?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.323
I couldn't cut it?

24:52.115 --> 24:53.074
So he sent me away?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.202
-No, no, that's not--
-[Luther] Pogo...

24:56.828 --> 24:59.414
[crying softly] Please leave me alone.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.709
-Master--
-Now, please! [yelling] Get out!

25:09.841 --> 25:12.552
[sobbing]

25:34.950 --> 25:36.409
[door creaks]

25:46.002 --> 25:48.004
-[Luther] Allison!
-[Allison] Shh!

25:50.382 --> 25:51.716
[door creaks]

26:00.642 --> 26:03.853
[in British accent] I have prepared a...

26:04.896 --> 26:05.730
feast.

26:06.773 --> 26:08.483
[Luther] Whoa, where'd you get those?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.986
My methods must remain mysterious.

26:12.195 --> 26:14.573
Well, you're not the only one
with secrets.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.410
Just in case.

26:20.120 --> 26:22.581
Ah. Oh, and, uh...

26:23.290 --> 26:24.124
one more thing.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.878
It's, um... It's for you.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.889
Do you, um... Do you like it?

26:44.102 --> 26:46.980
-[in normal voice] I'll never take it off.
-[chuckles]

26:48.440 --> 26:49.274
Oh.

26:49.774 --> 26:51.901
I almost forgot. I brought one more thing.

27:00.744 --> 27:01.661
[player clicks]

27:04.372 --> 27:05.457
[record needle scratches]

27:05.540 --> 27:07.626
[piano music playing]

27:07.709 --> 27:08.835
Luther Hargreeves,

27:09.502 --> 27:10.712
will you dance with me?

27:24.100 --> 27:25.602
-Number One?
-[record scratches]

27:25.685 --> 27:26.728
Number Three!

27:28.521 --> 27:30.482
This is highly unacceptable behavior.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.485
You both know that fun and games
are restricted to Saturdays

27:33.568 --> 27:35.779
-between noon and half past noon.
-But we were just--

27:35.862 --> 27:38.531
You will never come up here again.
Do you understand me?

27:39.741 --> 27:40.617
Never!

27:42.577 --> 27:45.246
-[Klaus] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-[Diego sighs] I hate this room.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.290
[Klaus] Oh, it got me high enough.

27:47.874 --> 27:50.960
I picked it clean of anything of value
after Daddy kicked the bucket.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.754
That's it, tighter and higher.

27:55.757 --> 27:57.884
Ooh. Ouf! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.636
-Fine.
-Ooh! Aah!

27:59.719 --> 28:02.681
-Aah!
-If I see a boner, I'm out.

28:03.139 --> 28:04.057
[Klaus chuckles]

28:04.140 --> 28:06.976
End of the world and you wanna
get sober all of a sudden.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.938
Don't get me wrong, man.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.564
-[groans]
-Good by you.

28:12.399 --> 28:14.442
But I'd think you'd wanna pop
every pill on the planet.

28:14.526 --> 28:18.405
Oh, the thought did cross my mind,
believe me, but...

28:19.155 --> 28:20.657
there's something I need to do,

28:20.740 --> 28:24.536
and the whole pesky thing doesn't seem
to work unless I'm sober.

28:25.912 --> 28:27.872
Is this is about conjuring
the one you lost?

28:27.956 --> 28:30.959
-[sighs]
-[Diego] What was her name?

28:46.599 --> 28:48.893
<i>His </i>name was Dave.

28:50.311 --> 28:52.647
We soldiered together
in the A Shau Valley...

28:53.940 --> 28:56.526
in the Mountain of the Crouching Beast.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.905
Well, Dave must have been
a very special person...

29:01.823 --> 29:03.867
-to put up with your weird-ass shit.
-[Klaus snorts]

29:04.242 --> 29:06.703
Yeah. [chuckles] Yeah, he was...

29:07.537 --> 29:11.583
He was kind, and strong,
and vulnerable, and...

29:13.251 --> 29:14.085
beautiful.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.629
Beautiful. And I was...

29:17.839 --> 29:21.426
foolish enough to follow him
all the way to the front line.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.887
-You fought in the shit?
-Oh yeah, baby.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.724
-[sighs]
-How'd they let you do that?

29:27.807 --> 29:31.311
Let me? War couldn't take enough bodies.
Please. [chuckles]

29:31.686 --> 29:32.937
Including his.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.734
[sighs] Hey, look at us.

29:37.817 --> 29:41.112
Loggin' in some quality bro time
before the end of the world.

29:41.696 --> 29:42.822
Yeah, might as well.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.658
Everyone I like is already dead.

29:45.742 --> 29:46.951
-[grunts]
-Ah, yes.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.536
The lady cop.

29:50.246 --> 29:51.080
[Diego] Yeah.

29:52.707 --> 29:53.625
Mom, too.

29:54.459 --> 29:55.585
[grunts]

29:56.669 --> 29:57.879
I let them both down.

30:00.381 --> 30:01.508
So here I am.

30:02.801 --> 30:03.760
Alone with you.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.893
Ah, shit!

30:13.269 --> 30:14.103
What?

30:15.605 --> 30:17.273
I need to pee.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.153
<i>Thanks, guys. Well, as you can see,</i>
<i>mysterious damage</i>

30:22.237 --> 30:25.865
<i>to multiple vehicles</i>
<i>and light posts occurred earlier today</i>

30:25.949 --> 30:27.492
<i>here in the midtown area.</i>

30:27.575 --> 30:29.702
<i>Authorities suspect a drunk driver.</i>

30:29.786 --> 30:31.246
<i>We'll have the full details for you</i>

30:31.329 --> 30:32.455
<i>-tonight at five.</i>
<i>-</i>Thanks.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.706
[Leonard] Are you okay?

30:34.123 --> 30:34.958
Yeah, I'm fine.
Okay.

30:38.461 --> 30:39.462
[sighs]

30:40.213 --> 30:41.798
-[TV switches off]
-Look, I...

30:41.881 --> 30:44.300
I'm sure this is a lot to deal with.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.847
You know, the idea that you've always had
these powers lying dormant.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.974
[scoffs] What, the ability
to bend lampposts?

30:51.266 --> 30:53.059
Your mood changed things.

30:53.518 --> 30:55.353
-The rain stopped. I saw it.
-[groans]

30:55.436 --> 30:58.690
That wasn't me.
I'm so sorry to disappoint you.

30:58.773 --> 31:01.776
Disappoint? You couldn't disappoint me
if you tried.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.030
But if you did do this, if it was you,

31:07.031 --> 31:09.033
that's beautiful, it's powerful.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.660
Look, if this was even true,

31:10.743 --> 31:13.454
everything I know about myself
would be different.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.540
Everything I've ever been told.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.627
-Do you think maybe your father knew?
-[scoffs] Come on. No way!

31:20.503 --> 31:23.256
Look, if I was special, I would have been
in the Umbrella Academy.

31:23.339 --> 31:25.758
I'm so sorry you got stuck
with the ordinary one.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.345
Ordinary is not a word
I'd use to describe you.

31:32.515 --> 31:33.975
Look, we'll figure it out...

31:34.893 --> 31:35.894
as a team.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.730
My life is so weird.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.649
I like weird.

31:43.693 --> 31:44.527
Clearly.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.119
[slurps]

31:53.912 --> 31:57.415
And that's how Phil determined
that the archduke just had to go.

31:57.874 --> 31:58.917
Care for dessert?

31:59.667 --> 32:01.920
I had a bad Twinkie
in the apocalypse once.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.504
It kind of put me off desserts.

32:03.588 --> 32:06.174
Please, indulge me.

32:08.801 --> 32:10.053
[Five sighs]

32:11.471 --> 32:12.513
[lighter clicks]

32:15.725 --> 32:16.893
What's that taste like to you?
The 1950s?

32:20.688 --> 32:22.106
[Handler] Precisely right.

32:22.523 --> 32:25.151
Our clever metaphysics division
concocted a way

32:25.234 --> 32:29.781
to perfectly distill an entire decade
into a single candy.

32:29.906 --> 32:33.576
This one's modeled after the Fudge Mutt,

32:33.785 --> 32:37.121
-America's favorite in 1955.
-Remarkable.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.916
You'll be happy to know
it's the very division

32:39.999 --> 32:41.209
that's building your new body.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.962
Oh, that reminds me.
I have something for you.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.381
-Carla?
-[Carla over intercom] <i>Yes?</i>

32:46.464 --> 32:48.967
-Would you bring the box in, please?
-<i>Certainly.</i>

32:49.050 --> 32:51.386
-[intercom clicks]
-[footsteps approaching]

33:00.520 --> 33:01.646
Go ahead. Open it.

33:04.524 --> 33:05.984
Clothes make the man, Five.

33:06.067 --> 33:08.486
Won't it be nice
when you can actually wear it?

33:09.529 --> 33:11.447
Very soon, I assure you.

33:11.531 --> 33:14.200
They're perfecting your body as we speak.

33:16.619 --> 33:17.453
Thank you.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.415
It's a very kind gift.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.045
Is that a Chinese flamethrower?

33:27.005 --> 33:27.964
[Handler] Good eye.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.176
War.

33:33.302 --> 33:35.555
Such a fascinating concept.

33:37.265 --> 33:41.978
A temporary salve
for a permanent human flaw.

33:42.061 --> 33:45.523
Course, it's a bit easier to see
from 30,000 feet.

33:45.606 --> 33:46.566
[chuckles]

33:46.649 --> 33:49.652
These are just some of the things
I've collected in my travels.

33:49.736 --> 33:53.197
M26 grenades from the Vietnam War.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.991
And this,

33:55.074 --> 33:56.576
the most noteworthy, perhaps.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.287
My Walther pistol.

33:59.370 --> 34:03.332
The very one Hitler used to kill himself.

34:03.666 --> 34:06.377
We're not supposed to take
these kind of things, but...

34:07.378 --> 34:09.088
he wasn't gonna use it anymore.

34:10.089 --> 34:13.259
Feel... how perfectly balanced that is.

34:14.385 --> 34:15.219
Hm?

34:22.018 --> 34:23.936
I had some thoughts
I wanted to run by you.

34:24.020 --> 34:26.272
Some suggestions
to improve Commission protocol.

34:26.355 --> 34:29.108
Mm! Shaking things up already.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.611
I admire that.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.280
Go on.

34:35.031 --> 34:36.074
Do tell!

34:37.366 --> 34:38.201
Gloria.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.119
-[Handler] Mm.
-The tube operator.

34:41.120 --> 34:44.207
Wouldn't it be simpler if case managers
were to send their own messages?

34:44.290 --> 34:46.793
I appreciate the thought. I really do.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.836
But everyone loves Gloria.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.838
I-- I would never hear the end of it.
[chuckles]

34:50.922 --> 34:53.091
She's been with the Commission family
for years,

34:53.174 --> 34:55.718
and she's this close to making pension.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.220
[knock at door]

34:57.303 --> 35:00.431
[panting] Sorry to interrupt.
May I have a moment alone?

35:00.848 --> 35:01.682
Of course.

35:02.725 --> 35:03.726
Duty calls.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.104
We'll continue this discussion later,
Five.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.480
Sure. May I?

35:07.563 --> 35:08.481
Please.

35:27.500 --> 35:28.334
Hey.

35:30.086 --> 35:32.630
So, I couldn't get a flight out
until tonight,

35:32.713 --> 35:33.840
and I don't know what to do.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.216
I can't just sit here.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.385
So I'm gonna head to the airport
and wait.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.263
I just-- I wanted to say goodbye.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.184
Luther?

35:45.977 --> 35:47.228
[inhales sharply]

35:48.604 --> 35:52.066
I found Dad's research
from my mission on the Moon.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.116
Every single package was still sealed.
-Why would he--
<i>-</i>[Luther] He never opened them

36:06.289 --> 36:08.541
because he never cared
what I was doing up there.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.294
Four years of my life.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.004
A lie.

36:16.424 --> 36:17.466
What an asshole.

36:17.758 --> 36:20.344
I'm not the right person
to stop this apocalypse, Allison.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.054
Hey, Luther. Don't say that.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.849
No, the world needs a leader
and I'm not it. I'm not.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.101
Dad knew it, and now I know it.

36:27.476 --> 36:28.603
I'm done.

36:34.358 --> 36:35.610
Can I show you something?

36:37.320 --> 36:40.615
-What? What is it?
-Just... Just come with me.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.995
What? You got something better to do?

36:49.749 --> 36:51.959
-[clatters]
-[laughs]

36:55.171 --> 36:57.506
[Luther] I can't believe it's still here.

36:57.590 --> 36:58.424
Me neither.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.137
I can't believe he didn't take it down
after he caught us up here.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.516
-[giggles]
-[Luther] Oh.

37:07.975 --> 37:08.893
Why are we here?

37:10.228 --> 37:13.022
To finish the feast. [giggles]

37:15.816 --> 37:18.527
-[Allison] Oh, God! Oh!
-Shoot. Hang on...

37:18.611 --> 37:19.987
[Allison] Oh, oh, oh... Okay...

37:20.071 --> 37:21.781
-[Luther] I... just...
-Yeah. Oh... Oh.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.866
[laughs] Just gotta get in there.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.535
-[sighs]
-[laughing] Easy, easy!

37:26.619 --> 37:28.246
-Ah.
-Okay.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.288
[sighs]

37:31.165 --> 37:33.167
[laughs]

37:36.420 --> 37:37.797
Guess we're not kids anymore.

37:39.298 --> 37:42.969
Could you just for one second
turn off that cynical brain of yours?

37:43.052 --> 37:45.346
I mean, this could be the last time
we ever...

37:51.686 --> 37:52.520
Ta-da!

37:52.603 --> 37:54.272
-Wow.
-[chuckles]

37:54.897 --> 37:55.815
Are these...?

37:55.898 --> 37:57.233
Yep, the very same.

37:59.402 --> 38:01.070
[chuckles]

38:13.791 --> 38:14.667
Cheers.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.757
-[grunts] Oh, my God...
-[gags]

38:21.841 --> 38:23.426
-I am so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.802
Oh, no, shit!

38:27.138 --> 38:27.972
God.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.807
[chuckles] Oh!

38:31.017 --> 38:32.393
Ah! [sighs]

38:33.602 --> 38:34.770
[coughs]

38:36.230 --> 38:38.024
Oh. Yeah.

38:39.525 --> 38:42.069
We're not kids anymore. [laughs]

38:43.529 --> 38:44.447
[sighs]

38:53.831 --> 38:55.708
Held up better than those sodas, huh?

38:56.625 --> 38:59.962
-[chuckles softly]
-You said you'd never take it off.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.675
Yeah. But I did.

39:09.263 --> 39:12.433
You know,
now that Dad's not here to catch us,

39:12.516 --> 39:16.145
we can go anywhere we want,
in the house, in the courtyard...

39:16.520 --> 39:17.438
The real world.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.776
You're right.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.737
You wanna get outta here?

39:27.907 --> 39:30.284
Yeah. I think I could squeeze you in.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.494
[chuckles]

39:32.787 --> 39:33.621
Come on.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.374
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, my God.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.459
[laughs]

39:39.418 --> 39:40.753
[groans]

39:41.754 --> 39:43.005
Oh, gosh. Okay.

39:50.679 --> 39:54.266
I guess I'm just tired of all this
being told what to do, where to go.

39:54.350 --> 39:57.228
<i>Let's forget the stupid briefcase.</i>
<i>Why not just stay here?</i>

40:11.826 --> 40:13.119
[sighs deeply]

40:14.245 --> 40:17.206
[waitress] It should only be
a couple more minutes on the jelly-filled.

40:17.790 --> 40:19.417
I'll call you when they're ready.

40:23.921 --> 40:27.299
-[laughter]
-[Hazel chuckles, speaking indistinctly]

40:29.343 --> 40:30.845
[both sighing]

40:30.928 --> 40:32.721
[Cha-Cha] That son of a bitch!

40:47.903 --> 40:50.739
-[sighs]
-Get you goin' here. A quick--

40:50.823 --> 40:52.700
You know, no, I-- I think...
I think this was...

40:52.783 --> 40:54.869
-Whoa. Wait.
-I think this was a bad idea. No. I just--

40:54.952 --> 40:58.622
I should have had just one last hit
to ease me into it. That's all I need.

40:58.706 --> 41:00.249
-Mm-hmm. No, no, no.
-I'll be right back.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.500
-I don't think so.
-[Klaus] No...

41:01.584 --> 41:03.627
-That's not how it works. Diego.
-Nope. Sit down.

41:03.711 --> 41:05.546
-[Klaus] Diego, listen. Just listen.
-Sit.

41:05.629 --> 41:08.257
Just listen. [groans]

41:08.340 --> 41:09.467
-Sit your ass down.
-[groans]

41:09.550 --> 41:11.427
-[coughs]
-[Diego] Sit down. Sit down.

41:11.510 --> 41:14.263
[gasping, coughing]

41:14.847 --> 41:16.098
Damn it, Diego!

41:17.349 --> 41:19.059
-Damn it! Stop it!
-Nope.

41:19.143 --> 41:20.603
-Stop it!
-[Diego] Nope!

41:20.686 --> 41:23.022
[yells] Get off! Get... Get off!

41:23.564 --> 41:28.027
Get off! [grunting]
Listen, listen. Listen to me.

41:28.110 --> 41:29.153
