00:50.806 --> 00:53.104
There you are.

00:54.777 --> 00:57.541
I've been looking for you.

01:02.918 --> 01:05.409
Have you seen my other shoe?

01:09.358 --> 01:10.825
What?

01:12.628 --> 01:14.187
What?

01:16.633 --> 01:19.466
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:31.381 --> 01:32.678
Go potty.

01:34.618 --> 01:35.983
Scotty.

01:37.253 --> 01:40.017
Come on, boy. Scotty.

01:40.190 --> 01:41.282
Go potty, Scotty.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.534
Don't look at me like that.

02:37.548 --> 02:38.776
Yes?

02:40.317 --> 02:42.718
Great way to start the day, right?

02:43.388 --> 02:45.356
I think I'm gonna puke.

02:46.925 --> 02:50.053
Mom said you went on a date last week.
How'd it go?

02:50.228 --> 02:51.695
It was okay.

02:52.064 --> 02:54.760
"Okay" as in you got laid?

02:55.200 --> 02:58.067
- Harry.
- What?

02:58.236 --> 02:59.726
She can't hear you.

02:59.905 --> 03:02.874
Don't you wanna have sex,
like, ever again in your life?

03:03.041 --> 03:06.943
Yes. I just don't think
that I'm the dating type.

03:07.679 --> 03:11.012
Girls only wanna sleep with me
because they read my book in high school.

03:11.183 --> 03:12.207
So?

03:12.384 --> 03:14.113
So they're not interested in me.

03:14.286 --> 03:16.754
They're interested in some idea of me.

03:16.922 --> 03:21.052
That's why you should keep working out.
That way, they'll want you for your body.

03:24.563 --> 03:26.225
What does this thing even do?

03:26.399 --> 03:28.526
It turns you into a god.

03:28.701 --> 03:30.259
Keep going.

03:33.339 --> 03:36.502
Hey, I had a weird dream last night.

03:36.676 --> 03:39.076
There was this girl and she was...

03:39.245 --> 03:41.076
What'd she look like?

03:41.681 --> 03:43.808
Just a normal girl. Just a girl I made up.

03:44.584 --> 03:46.074
Well, what happened?

03:46.252 --> 03:48.186
She just talked to me.

03:49.388 --> 03:50.912
That's depressing.

03:51.491 --> 03:53.789
Actually, it was really nice.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.891
Seriously? You don't even get laid
in your dreams? That's...

03:58.064 --> 03:59.964
That's just sad.

04:07.006 --> 04:09.133
Hey, how's the new book coming along?

04:09.308 --> 04:12.972
I don't know. I get a good idea,
like why don't I write about my dad?

04:13.147 --> 04:17.015
And then, bam, I start thinking
that it's the stupidest thing ever.

04:17.184 --> 04:19.812
Who wants to read about,
"He was disappointed in me...

04:19.987 --> 04:21.887
blah, blah, blah, blah"?

04:22.623 --> 04:25.114
Also, I'm feeling ambivalent
about Scotty.

04:25.492 --> 04:27.460
Yeah, he slobbers. He chews things.

04:27.628 --> 04:30.290
He pees like a girl,
which makes me feel inadequate.

04:30.764 --> 04:34.131
He needs to go outside a lot, breaks up
my day. That's why I'm not writing.

04:34.301 --> 04:36.826
Do you think that's why you're not writing?

04:38.806 --> 04:42.207
- No.
- Why do think you're not writing?

04:43.777 --> 04:45.836
Can I have Bobby now?

04:47.548 --> 04:50.949
- Do you need Bobby now?
- Yes.

04:53.020 --> 04:54.716
Calvin...

04:55.156 --> 04:57.647
when's the last time you saw a friend?

04:58.159 --> 04:59.353
Harry. Yesterday.

04:59.527 --> 05:02.894
No, no.
Someone other than your brother.

05:04.599 --> 05:07.193
Have you been giving Bobby
to your other patients?

05:07.368 --> 05:09.131
No, Bobby is just for you.

05:09.304 --> 05:12.740
- Because he smells weird.
- Calvin...

05:12.907 --> 05:16.570
when you were deciding to get Scotty,
what did we talk about?

05:16.744 --> 05:20.009
What did you say your hopes were?
Do you remember?

05:20.448 --> 05:23.110
That he would help me meet people.

05:23.284 --> 05:25.377
A little louder, please?

05:25.553 --> 05:28.420
That he would be awesome and
we'd take hikes and stuff.

05:28.590 --> 05:31.491
And people would stop to pet him,
and I would meet them.

05:31.659 --> 05:34.219
But Scotty gets scared
when people try to pet him.

05:34.395 --> 05:36.556
Does that embarrass you?

05:38.567 --> 05:41.035
- No.
- I wanna give you a writing assignment.

05:41.203 --> 05:43.194
- I can't write.
- Okay.

05:43.706 --> 05:45.640
This would just be for me.

05:45.808 --> 05:48.003
I'd like you to write a page...

05:48.177 --> 05:52.307
about someone who sees Scotty
all slobbery and scared...

05:52.481 --> 05:55.382
and likes him anyway,
just the way he is.

05:55.551 --> 05:57.985
You think you could do that for me?

05:59.088 --> 06:00.919
Can it be bad?

06:01.090 --> 06:03.456
I'd like it to be very bad.

06:13.168 --> 06:16.695
I first met Calvin
when he was 19 years old.

06:16.872 --> 06:18.533
And he'd already been at the top...

06:18.707 --> 06:22.337
Of The New York Times Best Seller
list for several months.

06:23.280 --> 06:25.612
And I remember thinking:

06:26.316 --> 06:27.613
"Who the fuck is this kid?

06:28.985 --> 06:32.682
And how can I go back in time
and be him?"

06:34.190 --> 06:37.421
A high-school dropout
with acne still on his chin...

06:37.594 --> 06:42.395
gave us what may very well become
a classic American novel.

06:42.565 --> 06:45.728
Since then, of course,
we've all enjoyed his short stories...

06:45.902 --> 06:49.599
Including last year's novella,
Breakfast for Dinner.

06:49.973 --> 06:53.465
But it was only when I sat down
and reread his novel...

06:53.643 --> 06:57.977
now available in a beautiful
10th anniversary edition...

06:58.148 --> 07:03.643
that, I realized just how good a writer
Calvin Weir-Fields is.

07:03.954 --> 07:06.320
We are lucky to have him around.

07:06.489 --> 07:08.321
Ladies and gentlemen,
Calvin Weir-Fields.

07:27.845 --> 07:30.473
- Phenomenal, man. Just brilliant.
- Thank you. Thanks.

07:30.648 --> 07:32.013
- Brilliant.
- Thanks so much.

07:32.183 --> 07:33.309
- Calvin.
- Hi.

07:33.484 --> 07:35.884
You know that chapter
where Charlie goes to the whorehouse?

07:36.053 --> 07:39.819
Did you dress the whores blue because
it's the color of his mother's apron?

07:39.991 --> 07:41.151
I'm sorry...

07:41.325 --> 07:43.623
How did you know
where to send your manuscript?

07:43.794 --> 07:45.056
I looked it up.

07:45.229 --> 07:46.594
Oh, of course.

07:48.399 --> 07:51.528
Is it weird for you
that you used to be so successful?

08:00.545 --> 08:02.479
There's the man.

08:02.647 --> 08:04.774
Cyrus, you gotta remind me
about these things.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.884
You have to check your messages,
buddy.

08:07.052 --> 08:08.952
I would've worn something nicer.

08:09.121 --> 08:11.521
No one cares what you're wearing.
You are a genius.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.590
Don't use that word.

08:13.892 --> 08:15.086
Mr. Perrotta, over here.

08:15.260 --> 08:17.251
- Calvin always had talent.
- Over here.

08:17.429 --> 08:19.397
But that, unfortunately, is not enough.

08:19.564 --> 08:21.794
- Langdon, right here!
- All I did, really...

08:21.967 --> 08:27.371
was guide him in the right direction
and like, pass the baton.

08:27.939 --> 08:29.406
Mabel.

08:29.574 --> 08:30.632
What?

08:30.809 --> 08:32.436
I'm Mabel.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.445
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

08:35.615 --> 08:37.309
Do you want my number?

08:37.482 --> 08:39.280
- It's a one-off, that book.
- Great.

08:39.452 --> 08:42.046
- It's the first album of an indie band.
- Thank you.

08:42.221 --> 08:46.055
It has that sort of
unselfconscious verve...

08:46.225 --> 08:49.524
that... That you don't...

08:49.695 --> 08:52.630
Then, of course, there's
the second album syndrome, which...

08:52.799 --> 08:54.289
We don't talk about that.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.595
Everyone loves this book,
but we wanna hear what you're doing now.

08:57.770 --> 09:01.467
What matters is right now.
What are you working on? Are you...?

09:01.641 --> 09:03.939
They love you, then they throw you away.

09:04.110 --> 09:07.273
- I mean, if I'm gonna include anybody...
- It's actually easier...

09:07.447 --> 09:10.211
if you've only ever been mediocre.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.008
If you've been at the top...

09:13.186 --> 09:14.585
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hi.

09:14.754 --> 09:16.346
It can kill you.

09:16.522 --> 09:19.720
Yeah, Salinger had the right idea. He...

09:19.893 --> 09:24.830
Write what you can, then, pssh, disappear,
you know?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.928
So I've had a drink.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.436
But no coke. I didn't... No coke.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.164
I didn't do any coke.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.081
Scotty?

09:52.826 --> 09:54.521
Scotty?

09:57.631 --> 09:59.861
Sorry I'm late, buddy.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.936
Scotty?

10:05.874 --> 10:08.069
Scotty, what the fuck?

10:35.069 --> 10:36.559
She's so cute.

10:37.772 --> 10:39.000
What?

10:39.174 --> 10:41.836
Your dog. She's so cute.

10:42.744 --> 10:43.904
Oh, he's a boy dog.

10:45.914 --> 10:48.440
He just peed like a girl.

10:49.852 --> 10:51.410
Have we met before?

10:51.587 --> 10:53.555
I don't think so.

10:54.490 --> 10:56.549
Do you mind if I draw him?

10:57.226 --> 10:58.557
But don't get too close.

10:58.727 --> 11:00.957
He's a little scared of people.

11:12.441 --> 11:13.908
- You're an artist?
- Yeah.

11:14.076 --> 11:16.476
- I'm super good.
- Really?

11:18.113 --> 11:20.946
- What's your dog's name?
- Scotty.

11:21.116 --> 11:22.674
- Are you Scottish?
- No.

11:22.851 --> 11:25.786
I named him for F. Scott Fitzgerald.

11:27.990 --> 11:30.686
- Who?
- F. Scott Fitzgerald.

11:30.859 --> 11:32.452
The novelist.

11:32.629 --> 11:34.460
Great Gatsby.

11:36.299 --> 11:38.028
I don't read a lot of fiction.

11:38.201 --> 11:40.669
You've never heard of
F. Scott Fitzgerald?

11:40.837 --> 11:43.670
Why? Is he really famous and important?

11:43.840 --> 11:47.537
Well, he's probably one of the greatest
novelists who ever lived.

11:47.711 --> 11:50.271
Isn't that disrespectful?

11:50.447 --> 11:51.505
What?

11:52.515 --> 11:55.541
Naming your dog after him?
It's a little disrespectful.

11:55.719 --> 11:58.654
- No, it's a gesture.
- Yeah, an aggressive gesture.

11:58.822 --> 12:02.189
Think about it. You're a novelist.
You think this guy's the greatest.

12:02.359 --> 12:05.294
So you name your dog after him
to cut him down to size.

12:05.629 --> 12:07.460
This way, you can put him on a leash...

12:07.631 --> 12:09.292
and yell "Bad Scotty"...

12:09.466 --> 12:12.629
and feel all superior
because you pee inside.

12:14.938 --> 12:17.373
Kill your idols, man. I'm all for it.

12:20.678 --> 12:22.509
All right. Scotty.

12:22.680 --> 12:23.840
Hang on.

12:29.887 --> 12:32.378
- This is beautiful.
- Yeah.

12:32.556 --> 12:35.491
Your dog might pee like a lady,
but I like him anyway.

12:35.660 --> 12:36.922
Hey, what did you just say?

12:37.094 --> 12:40.495
I like him just the way he is.

12:43.768 --> 12:45.326
Yes.

12:45.503 --> 12:47.664
Yes. Yes.

12:47.838 --> 12:50.830
Yes. Yes.

13:23.942 --> 13:27.378
"Pooled into his eyes as though...
Rushed back like blood...

13:27.746 --> 13:29.213
Calvin flushed with..."

13:31.416 --> 13:32.440
You're a genius.

13:32.617 --> 13:34.608
I thought we weren't
gonna use that word.

13:34.786 --> 13:37.880
You are really, really super fucking smart.
"I'd like it to be bad."

13:38.056 --> 13:40.650
I'm glad you found something
that inspires you.

13:40.826 --> 13:42.350
Inspires me?

13:42.961 --> 13:45.829
It overwhelms me.
I literally cannot sleep or eat.

13:45.998 --> 13:47.431
All I want I do is write.

13:47.600 --> 13:51.434
I mean, I almost didn't come here today
because I didn't wanna be away from her.

13:52.405 --> 13:53.531
- Oh, God.
- What?

13:53.706 --> 13:57.335
Oh, my God.
Oh, I can't say it out loud.

13:57.510 --> 14:00.240
- It's too stupid.
- I love it when you say stupid things.

14:00.413 --> 14:04.975
- Oh, no, this is really profoundly stupid.
- Okay.

14:07.387 --> 14:09.355
Okay, so the guy I'm writing...

14:09.522 --> 14:10.989
Yeah, what's his name?

14:11.157 --> 14:12.385
Calvin.

14:12.959 --> 14:18.397
I'm gonna change it.
Anyway, there's a lot of me in him.

14:19.499 --> 14:21.797
What I'm trying to say is...

14:22.135 --> 14:25.002
it's almost like I'm writing
to spend time with her.

14:25.171 --> 14:26.832
- Who?
- The girl.

14:27.006 --> 14:29.999
The one I'm writing. It's...
I go to sleep at night...

14:30.177 --> 14:33.010
just waiting to get to my typewriter
so I can be with her.

14:33.180 --> 14:36.809
It's like...
It's like I'm falling in love with her.

14:36.984 --> 14:39.817
- That's wonderful.
- I can't fall in love with a girl I write.

14:39.987 --> 14:41.750
- Why not?
- Because she's not real.

14:41.922 --> 14:43.981
- Isn't she? Are you sure?
- No. Yes.

14:44.158 --> 14:46.922
She's some motherfucking product
of my imagination!

14:49.163 --> 14:52.599
- Oh, Lila treated me so badly.
- I know.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.734
Who leaves someone after
their father dies?

14:54.902 --> 14:56.802
Someone who couldn't
love you properly.

14:56.970 --> 14:59.871
- Someone who is a heartless slut.
- Okay.

15:00.674 --> 15:04.371
- Well, tell me about her.
- I don't wanna talk about Lila anymore.

15:04.545 --> 15:08.641
Well, I meant this girl that you're writing.
Tell me about her.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.883
Ruby.

15:14.422 --> 15:16.322
Ruby Sparks.

15:16.491 --> 15:18.959
Twenty-six years old.
Raised in Dayton, Ohio.

15:20.094 --> 15:23.154
- Why Dayton?
- Sounds romantic.

15:23.331 --> 15:26.391
Ruby's first crushes were
Humphrey Bogart and John Lennon.

15:26.568 --> 15:29.036
Cried the day she found out
they were already dead.

15:30.505 --> 15:33.770
Ruby got kicked out of high school
for sleeping with her art teacher...

15:33.942 --> 15:36.877
or maybe her Spanish teacher.
I haven't decided yet.

15:37.712 --> 15:40.510
Ruby can't drive.
She doesn't own a computer.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.475
She hates her middle name,
which is Tiffany.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.553
She always, always roots
for the underdog.

15:47.722 --> 15:51.317
She's complicated.
That's what I like best about her.

15:52.193 --> 15:53.922
Ruby's not so good at life sometimes.

15:54.095 --> 15:57.588
She forgets to open bills
or cash checks and...

15:58.968 --> 16:00.731
Her last boyfriend was 49.

16:00.903 --> 16:03.428
The one before that was an alcoholic.

16:04.039 --> 16:08.476
She can feel a change coming.
She's looking for it.

16:08.644 --> 16:10.236
Looking for what?

16:12.548 --> 16:14.516
Something new.

16:17.253 --> 16:19.414
- Feels good, right?
- Can we stop a second?

16:19.588 --> 16:21.385
Why? You all right?

16:22.725 --> 16:24.590
- Hey, Sue.
- Yeah?

16:24.760 --> 16:26.557
They didn't have paprika, so I got cumin.

16:26.729 --> 16:28.321
They're the same thing, right?

16:28.497 --> 16:30.522
Miles went down.
If you wake him, I will beat you.

16:30.933 --> 16:33.595
Calvin? You need to thank me
because I cleaned your oven.

16:33.769 --> 16:35.396
- Thank you, Susie.
- Oh, my woman.

16:35.571 --> 16:38.096
Okay. You're sweaty.
Get your mitts off of me.

16:58.828 --> 17:02.389
- Susie, did you happen to sha...?
- You didn't tell me you were getting laid.

17:02.566 --> 17:03.658
- Harry.
- I'm just saying.

17:03.833 --> 17:06.700
He claims to be writing too much
to haul his ass to our house.

17:06.869 --> 17:09.361
But turns out,
he's just getting too much poon.

17:09.539 --> 17:12.440
- Harry, I swear to God...
- I'm not getting any poon.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.372
Oh, yeah?

17:15.011 --> 17:16.979
- Whose is that?
- You tell me.

17:18.013 --> 17:20.243
Oh, my God. Scotty.

17:20.584 --> 17:23.018
- It's Scotty's?
- No. Scotty...

17:23.185 --> 17:25.279
Don't let the baby touch that.
Miles, don't...

17:25.589 --> 17:27.922
- Suse, he likes it.
- No, he doesn't like it.

17:28.092 --> 17:30.583
- Scotty's been dragging them in.
- He seems to love it.

17:30.761 --> 17:32.820
He goes through
my weird neighbor's garbage.

17:32.997 --> 17:35.295
- So that's a random dirty bra?
- It's dirty.

17:35.466 --> 17:37.024
That's gross. You made him cough.

17:37.568 --> 17:39.627
Calvin, don't put it away.
Throw it away.

17:39.804 --> 17:42.102
I swear, if your mother knew...

17:42.506 --> 17:44.337
- Calvin, what is this?
- What's what?

17:44.508 --> 17:46.703
- Nothing.
- Harry, get over here.

17:47.111 --> 17:48.703
Please, don't.

17:49.113 --> 17:51.411
- Are these panties?
- Fuck off.

17:51.582 --> 17:53.516
I swear, Scotty's been dragging them in.

17:53.684 --> 17:54.946
- Right. Scotty.
- Shut up.

17:55.119 --> 17:58.520
Calvin, throw these away.

18:06.530 --> 18:09.465
- Hey, Susie, I'm gonna check on Harry.
- Okay.

18:09.635 --> 18:12.729
- Tell him we have to go soon.
- Okay.

18:31.089 --> 18:32.647
So?

18:33.725 --> 18:35.716
Where do you see this going?

18:36.762 --> 18:38.787
Well, I don't know. I just started.

18:38.964 --> 18:41.899
This is a love story, right?

18:42.067 --> 18:44.228
Who reads love stories?

18:44.403 --> 18:45.927
Women.

18:46.104 --> 18:48.971
And I'm telling you,
no woman's gonna wanna read this.

18:49.141 --> 18:50.267
Why not? It's romantic.

18:50.442 --> 18:54.607
Quirky, messy women whose problems
only make them endearing are not real.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.379
Period.

18:57.550 --> 19:00.041
What do they say,
"write what you've been through"?

19:00.219 --> 19:02.847
- Write what you know.
- Exactly. Write what you know.

19:03.022 --> 19:04.683
- I've known girls like Ruby.
- Yeah?

19:04.857 --> 19:06.222
Who?

19:06.459 --> 19:07.983
Girls.

19:08.161 --> 19:10.561
- Lila?
- Not fucking Lila.

19:10.730 --> 19:12.891
- You've had one relationship.
- For five years.

19:13.066 --> 19:15.261
You never even lived together.

19:16.269 --> 19:19.363
I'm telling you, Calvin,
the honeymoon shit, it doesn't last.

19:19.539 --> 19:22.770
- I know that.
- Women are different up close.

19:22.942 --> 19:24.637
I love Susie...

19:24.977 --> 19:26.740
but she's a weirdo.

19:26.913 --> 19:31.179
Sometimes, she's mean as fuck
for no reason.

19:31.350 --> 19:32.578
She's a person.

19:35.021 --> 19:37.649
You haven't written a person, okay?

19:37.824 --> 19:40.225
- You've written a girl.
- All right, whatever.

19:40.394 --> 19:42.862
Writers don't show their work
to people at this stage.

19:43.030 --> 19:44.998
I might not even finish it.

19:45.299 --> 19:47.927
Because...
And don't, like, tell people about it.

19:48.435 --> 19:51.461
Listen. I'm not saying you can't write.

19:52.806 --> 19:54.774
I'm saying...

19:55.809 --> 19:58.437
you don't know jack shit
about women.

20:02.483 --> 20:05.850
Don't let those leftovers go to waste,
okay, skinny?

20:07.054 --> 20:08.112
Gym tomorrow?

20:08.288 --> 20:10.279
I'm seeing Cyrus.

20:10.457 --> 20:13.153
- Maybe Friday?
- Friday.

20:13.827 --> 20:15.317
- I know.
- You okay, bud?

20:15.496 --> 20:16.758
Yes.

20:49.631 --> 20:51.394
This thing is dripping everywhere.

20:53.334 --> 20:55.734
How are you supposed to eat this thing?

21:02.777 --> 21:03.801
What?

21:05.914 --> 21:08.349
You're so not my type.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.717
What do you mean I'm not your type?

21:12.555 --> 21:18.858
I usually go for guys
who are a little more assertive.

21:19.428 --> 21:22.158
- I'm assertive.
- No.

21:22.331 --> 21:24.697
You're stubborn. That's different.

21:26.902 --> 21:28.597
I had this one boyfriend...

21:28.771 --> 21:30.796
who told me I wasn't funny...

21:30.973 --> 21:33.032
but that I have a good sense
of humor...

21:33.209 --> 21:35.700
because I laughed at his jokes.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.210
Why would you date a guy like that?

21:38.380 --> 21:41.213
I was young.
You must have things you regret.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.645
Not really.

21:42.818 --> 21:45.378
Everything's been perfect so far.

21:49.592 --> 21:53.620
So that's what you're looking for
in a guy?

21:54.064 --> 21:55.793
Douchiness?

21:59.302 --> 22:01.099
I don't know.

22:01.271 --> 22:03.865
I guess I was looking for you.

22:07.944 --> 22:10.310
It just took me a while to find you.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.051
- Ruby.
- Jump!

22:30.901 --> 22:33.699
What did you think
the first time you saw me?

22:33.870 --> 22:38.171
I thought you were
the most beautiful girl I ever saw.

22:38.809 --> 22:41.300
Were you disappointed
when you got to know me?

22:41.479 --> 22:43.640
How can you ask that?

22:43.814 --> 22:45.213
I'm such a mess.

22:45.383 --> 22:48.045
I love your mess.

22:48.486 --> 22:51.785
The first time I saw you, I thought:

22:51.956 --> 22:53.583
"Look at that boy.

22:53.758 --> 22:59.492
I'm going to love him
forever and ever and ever."

22:59.664 --> 23:02.531
- What if you get sick of me?
- I won't.

23:03.801 --> 23:05.826
I promise.

23:12.977 --> 23:14.968
Hello. Shit.

23:17.615 --> 23:19.174
Shit.

23:22.988 --> 23:25.684
Hello. Damn it.

23:26.658 --> 23:29.126
Okay. No.

23:31.964 --> 23:33.625
- Hello.
- Cyrus.

23:33.799 --> 23:35.323
- Where the fuck are you?
- Sorry.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.798
I was writing, I fell asleep.
I'll be right there.

23:37.970 --> 23:40.632
Look, if you aren't ready to
talk about this, it's fine.

23:40.806 --> 23:42.865
No... No, no.
I wanna show you what I have.

23:43.041 --> 23:45.066
I think you're gonna be really excited.

23:45.243 --> 23:48.406
Of course, I'll be excited. Okay,
here's what I'll do. I'll push my lunch.

23:48.580 --> 23:53.347
Okay. All right. Well if I leave now,
I should be there in 15 minutes.

23:53.518 --> 23:55.679
- All right.
- If there isn't any traffic.

23:55.854 --> 23:57.287
Oh, damn it. Scotty.

23:57.456 --> 23:59.515
- What?
- Nothing. My dog has to pee.

23:59.691 --> 24:02.091
- I'll put him in the backyard.
- I'll take him out.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.320
- Great. Thank you.
- Cal?

24:05.531 --> 24:06.964
Cal?

24:07.467 --> 24:08.764
Hello?

24:09.135 --> 24:11.103
I missed you in bed last night.

24:11.671 --> 24:14.139
- Did you get some good writing done?
- Are you there?

24:14.307 --> 24:15.934
- Oh, God.
- Hey, you want a bite?

24:16.109 --> 24:18.373
- It's Crispix.
- I think I lost him.

24:19.178 --> 24:22.875
God, it's happening.
It's really happening this time.

24:23.216 --> 24:25.343
- They're gonna hospitalize me.
- What's wrong?

24:25.518 --> 24:29.511
They all thought I was so smart,
but it turns out I was just batshit.

24:29.689 --> 24:31.919
- Calvin?
- What the fuck?

24:32.492 --> 24:34.119
Calvin.

24:35.461 --> 24:37.258
It's not real. It's not real.

24:37.430 --> 24:39.990
It's not real. It's not real.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.656
It's not real.

24:41.834 --> 24:43.597
Okay, you're dreaming.

24:43.770 --> 24:45.863
Okay, you're dreaming.

24:46.039 --> 24:47.404
You're dreaming.

24:47.574 --> 24:49.166
You're dreaming...

24:49.343 --> 24:53.074
and you're going to wake up...

24:54.381 --> 24:56.281
right now.

25:16.403 --> 25:18.803
Oh, shit.

25:22.209 --> 25:25.610
Calvin? Are you mad at me?

25:25.779 --> 25:27.406
Oh, God. It's not real.

25:27.581 --> 25:31.517
It's not real. It's not real.
It's not real.

25:32.821 --> 25:34.345
Doctor...

25:41.763 --> 25:44.960
Hi, Dr. Rosenthal. It's Calvin Weir-Fields.
Something has come up...

25:45.133 --> 25:49.536
and I'd appreciate it if you called me
as soon as possible. Thank you.

26:02.584 --> 26:04.848
- Ruby?
- Hey.

26:08.022 --> 26:13.460
I thought you might be hungry,
so I'm making you some eggs.

26:19.268 --> 26:21.634
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing.

26:21.804 --> 26:22.930
Nothing.

26:23.639 --> 26:27.405
Are these, by any chance, yours?

26:27.576 --> 26:30.136
Yeah, of course, they are.

26:30.646 --> 26:33.080
Who else would they belong to?

26:34.183 --> 26:35.343
Oh, my God.

26:37.253 --> 26:39.187
- Are you seeing someone else?
- Oh, no.

26:39.355 --> 26:41.016
No, no, no, I'm not...

26:41.190 --> 26:44.819
I'm not seeing anyone other than you.

26:46.929 --> 26:48.954
Will you excuse me?

26:50.666 --> 26:53.464
Remember how Dad used
to say I had an overactive imagination?

26:53.636 --> 26:55.866
Are you saying Ruby is in your house?

26:56.038 --> 26:57.505
I started seeing her this morning.

26:57.673 --> 27:01.235
It's like that movie Harvey,
except she's not a giant rabbit.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.709
It's not like she knows
she's imaginary, either.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.371
She thinks we're in the relationship
in my book.

27:06.550 --> 27:09.110
It is freaking me out.

27:09.619 --> 27:12.486
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- But this is an emergency.

27:12.656 --> 27:14.089
I may be losing my mind.

27:15.091 --> 27:18.083
- Just give me one sec. Just...
- Harry. Harry.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.661
There's no possible way
that Ruby's in your house...

27:20.830 --> 27:22.525
because she's not a real person.

27:22.699 --> 27:26.635
I know objectively she is not real,
but I'm telling you...

27:26.803 --> 27:28.862
I can see her, I can smell her.

27:29.039 --> 27:30.802
When she touched me, I could feel it.

27:30.974 --> 27:34.273
She's making eggs in my kitchen.
Actual eggs.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.706
That's great.

27:35.879 --> 27:39.815
Calvin, I am at work. I'm
in the middle of a very important meeting.

27:39.983 --> 27:41.814
I cannot deal with your shit right now.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.887
Listen to me.
I want you to leave the house...

27:45.056 --> 27:47.957
see a friend. A friend
who can't see your imaginary friend.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.356
If this is still an issue tonight,
we'll talk, okay?

27:51.529 --> 27:55.158
Okay. I'll phone a friend.

27:55.733 --> 27:56.961
Sorry about that, I was...

27:57.134 --> 28:00.228
Kobe's having a barbecue this weekend.
You got plans this weekend?

28:00.404 --> 28:01.996
It's Calvin.

28:02.540 --> 28:04.633
Weir-Fields. From high school.

28:06.210 --> 28:08.144
Yeah, the writer.

28:08.312 --> 28:10.712
I sat next to you in Spanish class.

28:15.720 --> 28:19.451
Actually, I gotta go.

28:48.854 --> 28:50.822
Where are you going?

28:52.090 --> 28:54.888
- Out.
- Where?

28:55.060 --> 28:56.925
To the store.

28:57.396 --> 28:58.829
What for?

28:58.997 --> 29:01.124
To get some stuff.

29:01.533 --> 29:04.127
- Can I come?
- No.

29:04.303 --> 29:07.204
- Why not?
- Because.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.602
- Please?
- No.

29:11.109 --> 29:13.135
Please?

29:32.465 --> 29:34.126
Point-nine KCRW.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.131
Up next, tickets for KCRW members.

29:36.302 --> 29:39.328
If you haven't won anything from us
in the last 90 days...

29:39.505 --> 29:43.168
I hear they're doing a zombie film festival
at the cemetery.

29:43.343 --> 29:48.508
You wanna go? We could do a shot
every time someone gets bitten.

29:48.681 --> 29:51.013
Okay. Bye.

29:51.184 --> 29:52.674
Bye? Where are you going?

29:52.852 --> 29:54.547
Nowhere.

29:55.388 --> 29:58.256
Café Figaro. I've got this friend.
It won't take long.

29:58.425 --> 29:59.983
What am I supposed to do?

30:00.160 --> 30:04.358
Stay here. Enjoy the shops.

30:04.531 --> 30:06.590
I'll be back soon.

30:08.535 --> 30:10.503
When I didn't hear from you right away...

30:10.671 --> 30:13.162
I figured you had lost my number
or something.

30:13.607 --> 30:16.371
At least that's what my roommate said
must have happened.

30:16.944 --> 30:20.380
Oh, no, I didn't lose your number.
Actually the night I met you...

30:20.547 --> 30:23.744
I started writing something,
so my life's been really consuming.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.111
The night you met me?

30:25.419 --> 30:27.114
Am I...?

30:27.287 --> 30:29.812
Never mind. Never mind.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.753
Am I in it?

30:32.493 --> 30:34.757
- I can't really talk about it.
- Right, of course.

30:34.928 --> 30:39.297
But if I am, like, when it comes out
in stores and stuff...

30:39.466 --> 30:42.265
- ...will you tell me which character I am?
- You're not in it.

30:42.437 --> 30:44.462
Right, but if I am?

30:45.573 --> 30:46.733
I will let you know.

30:47.142 --> 30:49.235
Okay. Awesome. Awesome.

30:54.449 --> 30:57.043
So do you do this a lot?

30:57.218 --> 30:59.778
- Do what?
- Meet up in the middle of the day for sex.

31:00.855 --> 31:03.688
No. No, that's not...
I just wanted someone to talk to.

31:05.393 --> 31:08.055
Right. Right.

31:08.229 --> 31:10.959
Well, men never just wanna talk
to women.

31:11.132 --> 31:13.498
- I do.
- If you say so.

31:13.668 --> 31:16.034
Are you even legal?

31:16.204 --> 31:20.265
I mean, not to drink, but, yeah.

31:20.442 --> 31:22.501
Of course. Do you...?

31:22.777 --> 31:24.335
Do you wanna go someplace?

31:26.549 --> 31:28.915
- Hi.
- Sorry, what?

31:29.084 --> 31:30.608
Do you wanna go to my place?

31:30.786 --> 31:32.344
- Hi.
- Sorry.

31:32.521 --> 31:33.886
- I'm sorry.
- What's going on?

31:34.056 --> 31:36.456
- Am I interrupting?
- I thought I heard something.

31:37.092 --> 31:38.889
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Calvin.

31:39.061 --> 31:43.430
- Do you know this girl?
- Yeah. Hi, I'm Ruby, Calvin's girlfriend.

31:43.599 --> 31:44.691
I don't think we've met.

31:45.434 --> 31:46.901
No.

31:47.069 --> 31:50.561
I'm Mabel. I was just going.

31:50.739 --> 31:52.798
- You can see her?
- Yeah, she can see me.

31:52.975 --> 31:54.237
I can see her.

31:54.510 --> 31:57.206
- You can see her.
- Let's not make this worse, all right?

31:57.379 --> 31:59.870
- Sorry, I didn't know.
- Did Harry put you up to this?

32:00.049 --> 32:02.040
- What, your brother is in on this?
- What?

32:02.218 --> 32:05.153
Ruby, it was very nice meeting you.
Calvin, have fun writing.

32:05.654 --> 32:07.212
Who the fuck was that?

32:07.389 --> 32:09.220
- Can you see her?
- Calvin, who was that?

32:09.391 --> 32:11.952
- Can I see her?
- Can he see me? What are you...? Stop.

32:12.128 --> 32:13.527
What's wrong with you, man?

32:15.765 --> 32:17.027
She's real.

32:17.834 --> 32:20.530
Oh, no. Ruby!

32:21.938 --> 32:23.530
Ruby! Ruby.

32:23.707 --> 32:25.197
- Get away from me!
- Ruby! Ruby!

32:25.375 --> 32:27.673
- Get away! Get away!
- Ruby!

32:27.944 --> 32:29.605
- Ruby, please, listen to me.
- Let go!

32:29.779 --> 32:31.508
- Stop!
- Listen to me. Calm down. Ruby.

32:31.681 --> 32:33.239
- Get away from me!
- Hey, you okay?

32:33.416 --> 32:34.974
You want me to call the police?

32:35.151 --> 32:38.382
No. Thank you.
He's just being a complete asshole.

32:38.555 --> 32:39.783
Are you sure?

32:41.091 --> 32:42.285
Yeah.

32:42.459 --> 32:44.484
Thank you, I'm fine.

32:46.730 --> 32:49.221
- Ruby.
- You stay away.

32:49.666 --> 32:53.067
God, I should have known. You've been
acting like such a freak... Stop!

32:53.236 --> 32:54.534
Let go of me!

32:54.705 --> 32:55.729
Put me down!

32:55.907 --> 32:57.431
Put me down or I'm gonna scream!

32:57.608 --> 32:58.632
- Ruby.
- Stop it!

32:58.809 --> 33:00.970
- Put me down!
- Ruby?

33:01.145 --> 33:02.612
Oh, my God, stop!

33:02.780 --> 33:05.647
Stop it. Oh, do not bite.
Do not bite.

33:05.816 --> 33:07.408
Listen to me.

33:07.585 --> 33:10.281
There is a lot that is new here,
more than I can tell you.

33:10.454 --> 33:12.445
I'm having trouble processing it all,
okay?

33:12.623 --> 33:14.352
Then talk to me about it.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.288
Don't go on a date with another girl.

33:16.460 --> 33:18.291
I wasn't on a date.

33:18.796 --> 33:22.129
- What is going on with you?
- I don't know. I'm sorry.

33:24.268 --> 33:27.499
Oh, I'm just having trouble...

33:27.672 --> 33:31.039
wrapping my head
around the reality of this situation.

33:32.743 --> 33:34.574
That you're here.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.379
That you're real.

33:40.953 --> 33:43.513
It all seems pretty incredible.

33:49.094 --> 33:50.459
What?

33:52.898 --> 33:55.423
Kiss me, stupid.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.681
Holy shit.

35:48.882 --> 35:53.980
Look, I know it's a lot to take in,
but you have to believe me.

35:54.155 --> 35:55.213
She's real.

35:55.390 --> 35:57.915
I don't know how or why...

35:58.093 --> 36:02.325
but she's here and she's real.

36:02.497 --> 36:04.021
And I like it.

36:04.199 --> 36:08.966
- "Real" as in other people can see her.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

36:09.904 --> 36:13.101
We've been to restaurants.
We take Scotty for walks in the park.

36:13.274 --> 36:18.576
- People talk to her. She's very friendly.
- That's impossible.

36:18.747 --> 36:21.079
It's apparently not.

36:24.319 --> 36:27.379
What does Dr. Rosenthal say?

36:33.394 --> 36:35.590
Are you fucking serious?

36:35.765 --> 36:38.325
People have shrinks
for when they start seeing things.

36:38.501 --> 36:39.593
I'm not seeing things.

36:39.769 --> 36:41.999
- Calvin, call him.
- I can't.

36:43.105 --> 36:45.869
I told him when she was a character.
He won't understand.

36:46.041 --> 36:48.475
- Call him or I'm telling Mom.
- He'll think I'm crazy.

36:48.644 --> 36:50.134
You might be crazy.

36:50.446 --> 36:52.505
The situation is crazy.

36:52.681 --> 36:54.114
I am not.

36:54.483 --> 36:56.383
Do you hear...? Hi.

36:56.552 --> 36:59.783
Do you hear yourself? Do you?
Do you hear yourself? Really?

37:01.157 --> 37:05.389
There's no way that you're sleeping
with a girl that you made up.

37:14.637 --> 37:18.038
Hey, so she doesn't know
that I wrote her...

37:18.207 --> 37:20.642
so don't say anything
about the manuscript, okay?

37:20.811 --> 37:22.608
Yeah, okay.

37:23.747 --> 37:27.080
Hi, Ruby. Great to meet you.
Can we call the doctor now?

37:27.250 --> 37:28.581
- Harry.
- Calvin!

37:28.752 --> 37:30.276
Hey.

37:30.453 --> 37:32.284
What took you so long?

37:32.455 --> 37:35.322
- Hey, Ruby, this is my brother, Harry.
- Hey.

37:35.492 --> 37:38.017
- Harry. Hi.
- Hi.

37:38.195 --> 37:40.493
- Hi. It's great to meet you.
- Hi.

37:41.131 --> 37:43.964
I've heard so much about you
from Calvin.

37:44.134 --> 37:45.795
You're Ruby.

37:45.969 --> 37:47.334
You're Harry.

37:47.504 --> 37:50.029
The painter from Dayton, Ohio.

37:50.207 --> 37:52.437
- Yep.
- Yep.

37:52.609 --> 37:54.804
Are you staying for supper?
I'm making meat loaf.

37:54.978 --> 37:57.276
She's an amazing cook.

37:57.881 --> 38:00.782
Yeah. Can I talk to you a second?
Outside?

38:00.951 --> 38:02.213
Okay.

38:10.394 --> 38:13.886
What did you do? Hire some actress?
Craigslist? This isn't funny.

38:14.065 --> 38:15.532
I told you, she just appeared.

38:15.700 --> 38:17.930
- You're a writer, not Ricky Jay.
- I know that.

38:18.102 --> 38:21.401
- There's gotta be some logical explanation.
- Love isn't logical.

38:21.572 --> 38:23.938
No, but you know what is?
Physics. Or metaphysics.

38:24.108 --> 38:26.303
- People don't appear out of thin air.
- She did.

38:26.477 --> 38:27.603
- How?
- I don't know how.

38:27.778 --> 38:29.643
It's love. It's magic.

38:29.814 --> 38:31.372
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

38:31.549 --> 38:32.880
- Calling your doctor.
- Don't.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.574
- Harry. Harry.
- Give me that.

38:34.752 --> 38:37.778
- We might... Give me the phone.
- Harry, listen to me, please.

38:38.322 --> 38:40.381
Remember what you told me
when you met Susie?

38:40.558 --> 38:44.494
- I certainly didn't pretend I invented her.
- You said that she was your dream girl.

38:44.662 --> 38:46.653
That's what happened to me.

38:46.831 --> 38:48.094
Harry, don't laugh at me.

38:48.267 --> 38:50.701
Has it occurred to you
that she might be an imposter?

38:50.869 --> 38:54.600
Some girl wanted to get close to you,
somehow got her hands on what you wrote.

38:54.773 --> 38:56.832
You're the only one
who's read my manuscript.

38:57.009 --> 38:59.773
- So unless you're playing some joke...
- Okay, okay, okay.

38:59.945 --> 39:03.540
Let's say you created this person.
Everything you wrote about her came true.

39:03.715 --> 39:06.343
- Even the smallest things?
- Yes.

39:06.518 --> 39:09.783
- Have you tried writing more?
- No.

39:10.555 --> 39:12.022
Write something about her.

39:12.758 --> 39:14.157
Why? She's perfect.

39:14.326 --> 39:16.521
Write something about her,
see if it comes true.

39:16.695 --> 39:19.459
If it does, then you're right
and this is a fucking miracle.

39:19.631 --> 39:20.859
And if nothing happens...

39:22.634 --> 39:24.829
maybe we go to the police.

39:29.608 --> 39:33.101
- Don't call...
- Just go in there and act normal. Go up.

39:36.449 --> 39:38.440
- You act normal.
- I'm not gonna say...

39:46.592 --> 39:51.120
We're gonna go upstairs
and check on something online.

39:54.701 --> 39:57.431
Were you guys getting stoned out there?

39:57.737 --> 40:01.002
Okay, here's where I left off.

40:04.377 --> 40:06.937
It has to be something
we notice right away, okay?

40:07.113 --> 40:09.206
Something obvious.

40:10.249 --> 40:13.548
- What she's wearing?
- Yes. Yes.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.210
What she's wearing.

40:20.661 --> 40:22.595
What was she wearing?

40:23.197 --> 40:24.994
Was it pink?

40:27.935 --> 40:29.596
I got it.

40:30.337 --> 40:32.100
Okay. Okay.

40:32.272 --> 40:35.173
Write that she speaks fluent in French.

40:35.342 --> 40:37.105
Yeah, just put it down.

40:37.277 --> 40:40.440
- I'll do it.
- I...

41:16.518 --> 41:17.951
Bah!

41:28.997 --> 41:32.433
- I'll be right back. I have to do something.
- No, wait, hold it.

41:41.209 --> 41:42.767
Calvin.

41:53.856 --> 41:55.721
Bottle of vino.

41:55.958 --> 41:59.985
Great. Your brother looks like
he could use a drink.

42:06.335 --> 42:09.964
I have to say,
that's the best meat loaf I've ever had.

42:10.139 --> 42:11.504
Thank you.

42:11.674 --> 42:13.039
It's a family recipe.

42:13.576 --> 42:15.476
I can't really take credit.

42:15.644 --> 42:18.772
So your... Your family's in Ohio?

42:19.115 --> 42:22.778
Yeah. Actually, my parents died
when I was a baby in an accident...

42:22.952 --> 42:24.783
and I got moved around a lot.

42:24.954 --> 42:26.182
I guess the habit stuck.

42:26.355 --> 42:30.053
- I've lived in nine cities in six years, so...
- Nine?

42:30.227 --> 42:33.390
- Yeah.
- That's a lot of cities.

42:33.563 --> 42:36.191
I'm so sorry. I'm totally
monopolizing this conversation.

42:36.366 --> 42:38.459
No. This is fascinating.

42:38.768 --> 42:40.633
Please, keep going. Please.

42:41.671 --> 42:43.366
What nice boys.

42:43.540 --> 42:47.340
Your mom must be so proud.
It's hard to raise a decent guy.

42:47.511 --> 42:50.844
Oh, I think a person would have to do
something pretty amazing...

42:51.014 --> 42:52.504
to produce a good woman.

42:52.682 --> 42:54.274
Okay. Great.

42:54.451 --> 42:57.818
You guys like each other.
I think Harry has to go now.

42:57.988 --> 42:59.046
Right, buddy?

42:59.222 --> 43:02.157
He can be such a control freak, right?

43:04.761 --> 43:06.456
- I'll be right back.
- Good night.

43:06.630 --> 43:09.155
- See you soon, I hope.
- Hey. So?

43:09.332 --> 43:11.391
- Get in the car.
- What?

43:11.902 --> 43:13.837
- Get in the car.
- Why? What...?

43:18.876 --> 43:21.071
That was insane!

43:23.181 --> 43:24.341
- Harry...
- This is insane.

43:24.515 --> 43:26.278
You manifested a woman with your mind.

43:27.018 --> 43:29.486
- Mom's gonna fucking freak.
- You can't tell Mom.

43:29.654 --> 43:32.214
- Why not? She loves all this New Age shit.
- Seriously...

43:32.390 --> 43:35.291
you can't tell anybody.
Not Mom, not Susie. No one.

43:35.459 --> 43:38.622
- This is amazing. How can I not tell?
- They'll think she's a freak.

43:38.796 --> 43:42.596
- We're gonna pretend she's your girlfriend?
- She is my girlfriend.

43:44.835 --> 43:46.166
Seriously?

43:46.337 --> 43:48.328
- Why not?
- Your girlfriend.

43:48.506 --> 43:50.770
- Stranger things have happened.
- I don't think so.

43:51.342 --> 43:56.041
I think this is pretty much the strangest
thing that's ever happened, ever.

43:56.214 --> 43:58.046
You gonna marry her?
Have kids with her?

43:58.217 --> 44:01.118
- I don't know.
- But wouldn't that be like incest?

44:01.286 --> 44:03.550
- Or mind-cest?
- I don't care.

44:04.256 --> 44:06.053
I love her.

44:06.558 --> 44:08.150
Please, don't ruin this for me.

44:08.327 --> 44:10.591
Promise me, no one.

44:14.299 --> 44:15.596
Fine.

44:16.134 --> 44:17.260
Thank you.

44:20.239 --> 44:24.369
Oh, hey, so you can, like, change her.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.675
I guess.

44:30.916 --> 44:35.376
You could, like, tweak things
if you wanted.

44:35.554 --> 44:37.749
Tweak? What do you mean?

44:37.923 --> 44:40.448
I don't know, like anything.
Big tits, long legs...

44:40.626 --> 44:43.687
- I like her little legs.
- Know how many times I wanted a button...

44:43.863 --> 44:46.559
to make Susie stop doing
all the annoying shit she does?

44:46.733 --> 44:49.531
I mean, you could get blow jobs
whenever you wanted.

44:49.702 --> 44:50.999
Ruby loves giving blow jobs.

44:51.170 --> 44:53.468
Now, but what about
in a couple months or days?

44:53.640 --> 44:56.438
Women are mysterious creatures.
I still look at Susie like:

44:56.609 --> 44:58.338
"Who are you? Who are you?"

44:58.511 --> 45:01.503
I know Ruby, Harry. I wrote her.

45:01.681 --> 45:04.047
So you can make her, like, do anything.

45:07.754 --> 45:09.915
For men everywhere...

45:10.590 --> 45:13.650
tell me you're not gonna let that
go to waste.

45:17.063 --> 45:19.861
I will never write about her again.

45:28.842 --> 45:30.366
Calvin?

45:31.178 --> 45:32.702
Hey.

45:34.381 --> 45:37.544
So did he like me?

45:43.057 --> 45:44.957
He loved you.

46:16.558 --> 46:18.526
Stop, stop, stop.

46:20.061 --> 46:21.824
Hey, if it's my mom, please, don't...

46:22.597 --> 46:24.155
Hello?

46:24.933 --> 46:26.833
Hello, is anyone there? I don't...

46:27.001 --> 46:28.127
Hi, Mom.

46:28.303 --> 46:31.898
Oh, hi, sweetie. Hi.
I wasn't sure you were there.

46:32.073 --> 46:33.700
What do you want, Mom?

46:33.875 --> 46:36.537
I was wondering if
you're gonna make it up this weekend.

46:36.711 --> 46:39.305
I told you we can't this weekend.
We're busy.

46:39.481 --> 46:41.073
- Oh, with what?
- Busy with what?

46:41.249 --> 46:43.444
Your brother says
you haven't been writing.

46:43.618 --> 46:46.246
- He doesn't know.
- You've been with this girl for months.

46:46.421 --> 46:49.549
I haven't even met her.
I'm beginning to think she doesn't exist.

46:49.724 --> 46:51.851
What? No. I mean, yes.

46:52.026 --> 46:54.461
- So when can I meet her?
- Soon.

46:54.630 --> 46:57.463
Next weekend?
Harry and Susie will be here.

46:57.633 --> 46:58.657
Come on, please?

46:58.834 --> 46:59.926
Look, we have plans.

47:00.102 --> 47:02.502
I'm gonna call you later, okay?
I'm driving.

47:03.572 --> 47:05.631
Why can't we go to Big Sur?

47:05.808 --> 47:09.300
Well, we'd have to find someone
to watch Scotty.

47:09.478 --> 47:11.002
We could take him with us.

47:11.180 --> 47:13.045
I don't know. Mort...

47:13.215 --> 47:14.944
Their house is weird.

47:15.117 --> 47:16.482
You don't want me to meet your mom.

47:16.652 --> 47:18.813
Of course, I want you to meet my mom.

47:18.988 --> 47:21.456
I'll invite her down for Christmas, okay?

47:26.128 --> 47:29.894
Hey, you know that coffee shop on Dwyer?
The new one?

47:30.065 --> 47:31.657
Yes.

47:32.635 --> 47:36.628
I was thinking maybe
I could try to get a job there.

47:36.972 --> 47:40.204
Well, I told you,
I'm happy to support you while you paint.

47:41.645 --> 47:44.273
Honey, I'm sort of tired.

47:45.182 --> 47:46.672
Okay.

47:46.850 --> 47:48.875
Let's turn out the light, then.

47:58.562 --> 48:02.328
It's just, maybe if I wasn't around,
you could get more writing done.

48:02.499 --> 48:05.559
Weren't you working on something
when we first met?

48:08.772 --> 48:10.239
Calvin?

48:21.518 --> 48:23.350
What are you doing?

48:24.388 --> 48:26.788
Just packing for Big Sur.

48:27.959 --> 48:29.654
Really?

48:29.827 --> 48:31.260
Yeah.

49:16.775 --> 49:18.436
Look at this place.

49:18.610 --> 49:22.171
All right, this is it.

49:22.347 --> 49:24.440
You asked for it.

49:24.616 --> 49:27.016
You have nothing to worry about.

49:30.889 --> 49:33.551
Look, why don't we stay
somewhere else tonight?

49:34.035 --> 49:37.368
Just you and me. There's a thousand
bed-and-breakfasts around.

49:37.538 --> 49:40.029
- Honey, it's gonna be great.
- It could be romantic.

49:40.208 --> 49:42.301
- Finally.
- Hi.

49:42.477 --> 49:44.001
- You're here!
- Hi.

49:44.178 --> 49:45.202
- Hi.
- Hi.

49:45.379 --> 49:46.573
- Okay.
- Hi, Scotty.

49:46.747 --> 49:49.773
- Hi. Come on. Come on, Scotty.
- Okay.

49:49.951 --> 49:51.180
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

49:51.353 --> 49:52.980
- Hi. I'm Ruby.
- Hi, Ruby.

49:53.155 --> 49:54.486
Hi.

49:55.290 --> 49:58.623
Your garden is so amazing.

49:58.794 --> 50:01.354
All the plants have medicinal purposes.

50:01.530 --> 50:04.055
- Medicinal.
- Yeah.

50:04.233 --> 50:06.531
That is very cool.

50:11.006 --> 50:13.304
- This is incredible.
- Yeah.

50:13.475 --> 50:17.002
He started it in 1980
and he just keeps adding to it.

50:17.179 --> 50:19.204
It's his masterpiece.

50:19.381 --> 50:20.939
- Mort built all of this?
- Yeah.

50:21.116 --> 50:23.949
- Can you believe it?
- Yes, I can.

50:24.653 --> 50:28.419
And this is where we live.

50:29.124 --> 50:31.615
Oh, my God.

50:31.793 --> 50:33.385
This is so beautiful.

50:36.165 --> 50:38.690
I feel like I'm in some kind of temple.

50:38.868 --> 50:43.498
Oh, my God,
I can't believe you said that.

50:43.673 --> 50:47.074
- Calvin, she is so intuitive.
- What? What? What?

50:47.243 --> 50:50.371
Mort got this wood from Amish land.
It was blessed.

50:50.547 --> 50:53.778
And the bricks come from an old
Catholic school that was torn down.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.349
That's incredible.

50:55.518 --> 50:57.509
Stairway, bedroom.

50:57.687 --> 50:59.780
That's where Harry will sleep.

50:59.956 --> 51:01.981
This is my study. Don't go in there.

51:02.158 --> 51:04.649
I'm re-alphabetizing.

51:04.894 --> 51:08.523
And this is where you'll be sleeping.

51:09.165 --> 51:11.861
Oh, it's like a little nest.

51:12.035 --> 51:15.095
Mom, we're in here? There are no doors.

51:15.405 --> 51:17.771
No one's interested
in your business, honey.

51:19.443 --> 51:21.707
Well, this is the bathroom.

51:21.879 --> 51:23.471
We have our own well.

51:25.382 --> 51:27.782
This is Mort's workshop!

51:29.787 --> 51:32.722
He makes driftwood furniture!

51:32.890 --> 51:34.289
Mort!

51:35.459 --> 51:38.257
Mort, honey, they're here!

51:38.429 --> 51:40.158
Hey!

51:40.397 --> 51:42.126
Welcome!

51:42.399 --> 51:43.866
That's a good boy, good boy.

51:44.034 --> 51:46.969
- He is such a good boy.
- So, Ruby...

51:47.137 --> 51:48.968
did you go to art school?

51:49.139 --> 51:50.629
No, I didn't train formally.

51:50.808 --> 51:52.935
I just sort of picked things up
here and there.

51:53.110 --> 51:56.739
That's right. Just do it.
You learn more that way, eh?

51:56.914 --> 51:58.882
I mean, look at Calvin, eh?

51:59.049 --> 52:01.415
Right, hijo mio?

52:01.585 --> 52:03.850
Mort, could you not feed Scotty?

52:04.022 --> 52:06.547
- Don't worry. He loves it.
- It'll upset his stomach.

52:06.725 --> 52:09.319
Dogs love human food. They do.

52:09.494 --> 52:11.121
- No, they don't.
- They do.

52:11.296 --> 52:12.820
I painted when I was young.

52:12.998 --> 52:14.295
- Did you?
- Yeah.

52:14.466 --> 52:16.400
Calvin never told me.

52:16.568 --> 52:18.263
Well, their father didn't approve.

52:18.436 --> 52:19.903
Because she painted porn.

52:20.071 --> 52:21.800
- Nudes.
- In positions.

52:21.973 --> 52:23.440
It was basically porn.

52:23.608 --> 52:26.406
I think they are very sexy, Harry.

52:26.578 --> 52:29.706
Mort's been encouraging me
to take it up again.

52:29.881 --> 52:32.179
You should do it, Mama.
You're very good at it.

52:32.350 --> 52:33.942
Lovey.

52:34.119 --> 52:36.349
- You're good at everything.
- Lovey.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.182
Everything is so good, Mama.

52:38.356 --> 52:40.187
- Oh, sweetie.
- So good.

52:40.358 --> 52:41.620
- Okay.
- Let's go, let's go.

52:41.793 --> 52:43.385
One minute left. One minute.

52:43.561 --> 52:44.653
First word!

52:44.829 --> 52:45.955
- A little word.
- No, big word.

52:46.131 --> 52:47.895
- If. It's.
- And.

52:48.067 --> 52:49.159
- It's.
- The, the, the.

52:49.335 --> 52:51.064
- Well...
- What.

52:51.937 --> 52:52.961
- What.
- What?

52:53.139 --> 52:54.231
What.

52:54.407 --> 52:57.103
What.

52:57.276 --> 52:59.005
- Thank you, Mort.
- You're on our team.

52:59.178 --> 53:00.702
- Second word.
- You're on our team.

53:02.648 --> 53:04.878
- Redwoods.
- They're not gonna get it.

53:05.051 --> 53:06.450
- You and me. Not them. Us.
- Us.

53:06.619 --> 53:07.643
- We...
- Us.

53:07.820 --> 53:08.946
A girl's...

53:09.121 --> 53:11.282
The T's and butt...

53:11.457 --> 53:12.890
- Babies! Girls?
- Oh, boy.

53:13.059 --> 53:14.083
- Women!
- Women?

53:14.660 --> 53:16.252
- "What women."
- Mort.

53:16.429 --> 53:18.522
"What women."

53:18.698 --> 53:20.029
- What Women Want?
- What Women Want.

53:21.801 --> 53:23.928
Oh, they won!

53:24.103 --> 53:26.367
- What Women Want? Who picks that?
- Come over here.

53:26.539 --> 53:28.268
- You're so good.
- Mort? He picked it?

53:28.441 --> 53:30.966
I love you. Oh, my God. You win the prize.

53:31.143 --> 53:32.611
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

53:32.779 --> 53:35.213
- I'm her trainer.
- But that was against the rules!

53:38.585 --> 53:40.109
Calvin.

53:40.420 --> 53:41.751
Calvin.

53:41.922 --> 53:43.583
I forgot to tell you.

53:43.757 --> 53:48.319
Your mom said that she was gonna
teach me how to bake a pie.

53:48.495 --> 53:53.057
She says we can just go out in the garden
and pick the berries ourselves.

53:53.233 --> 53:56.066
Isn't that amazing?

53:56.803 --> 53:59.670
She didn't used to be like this.

54:01.041 --> 54:02.565
Like what?

54:03.643 --> 54:08.706
When Dad was around,
she wore polo shirts and cooked meat.

54:08.882 --> 54:11.248
It's like she's been brainwashed.

54:13.053 --> 54:16.182
I think she and Mort seem really happy.

54:24.699 --> 54:27.293
Calvin!

54:27.468 --> 54:28.662
- Watch out!
- Come on!

54:28.970 --> 54:31.370
- Come down here!
- Hey, Calvin!

54:32.173 --> 54:34.004
Calvin! Calvin!

54:34.175 --> 54:35.699
- Let's go!
- Watch out!

54:35.877 --> 54:39.074
- The water's great, man, come on.
- It's beautiful!

54:39.247 --> 54:40.373
No, thanks.

54:40.748 --> 54:45.481
- Oh, it's so fun. You're missing out.
- I promised Langdon I'd finish his book.

54:46.120 --> 54:47.985
Why don't you come up here with me?

54:48.156 --> 54:49.953
Okay, enjoy yourself!

54:50.258 --> 54:51.486
Mort, be careful.

54:51.659 --> 54:54.059
Asteroid!

54:56.631 --> 54:58.155
Yeah!

54:58.332 --> 55:00.733
- Yeah!
- That was beautiful.

55:01.303 --> 55:02.861
Now do it with me. Do it with me.

55:14.283 --> 55:16.308
Calvin, honey?

55:18.987 --> 55:20.978
Are you okay?

55:21.390 --> 55:23.881
Yeah. I'm fine.

55:24.326 --> 55:25.350
Okay.

55:25.527 --> 55:27.825
I'm really glad you brought her.

55:27.996 --> 55:29.827
It means a lot to me.

55:29.998 --> 55:31.295
Okay.

55:31.466 --> 55:32.990
Okay.

55:33.802 --> 55:36.168
Dinner's in a half hour.

55:40.342 --> 55:41.934
But, hey, Harry, Harry, Harry.

55:42.110 --> 55:45.342
- You wanna see my impression of Scotty?
- Yeah.

55:47.417 --> 55:49.248
That makes me laugh.

55:49.419 --> 55:52.149
Wanna see my impression of Scotty
when he's really angry?

55:52.322 --> 55:53.516
Yeah.

55:54.257 --> 55:55.281
That's so wrong.

55:57.560 --> 55:58.925
He's an intellectual.

56:01.331 --> 56:03.595
Oh, that is good.

56:04.033 --> 56:05.398
Don't make fun of Scotty.

56:06.903 --> 56:09.394
Oh, calm down.

56:09.572 --> 56:12.473
- Hey, come on. Take it.
- Oh, my God. You look so cute here.

56:12.642 --> 56:15.110
- That was such a classic.
- I told you I don't want it.

56:15.278 --> 56:19.112
- You should try it. It's really mellow.
- It's all right. He doesn't need it.

56:19.449 --> 56:22.247
- His brain is big enough.
- Yeah, no, it's big.

56:22.418 --> 56:24.283
It's so big, he can...

56:24.454 --> 56:27.355
Just with his thoughts, he can just...
He thinks it and:

56:28.826 --> 56:30.054
- Harry?
- Just...

56:30.227 --> 56:32.252
- Just...
- Honey, not here.

56:32.429 --> 56:35.296
One thought. I mean, he
just can just, poof.

56:35.466 --> 56:37.991
- He just, poof.
- Harry, I think you've had enough.

56:39.570 --> 56:43.506
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about I love you.

56:44.275 --> 56:46.971
- What?
- Yay, someone is ready for bed.

56:47.144 --> 56:49.135
- Yeah, I'm definitely ready.
- Let's go.

56:49.313 --> 56:50.780
Well, this was a great dinner.

56:52.650 --> 56:55.244
- Here, let me... Let me help you.
- You know what, Mort?

56:55.419 --> 56:57.853
I think you've done plenty.

56:58.289 --> 57:00.018
- Yeah. Good night.
- Great, great.

57:00.190 --> 57:01.384
- You okay?
- Yeah, you okay?

57:01.558 --> 57:02.991
- Go.
- I'm fine.

57:03.160 --> 57:04.286
Big Sur, everybody.

57:04.461 --> 57:08.192
- Come on, crazy.
- I love this place. Love you.

57:08.365 --> 57:12.564
I think I'm gonna go inside
and talk to him.

57:12.737 --> 57:14.295
Okay.

57:19.077 --> 57:20.101
I'm sorry.

57:20.445 --> 57:21.969
No, it's okay.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.843
As long as I know
he isn't like this all the time.

57:25.216 --> 57:27.275
He isn't.

57:27.452 --> 57:28.885
Good.

57:38.630 --> 57:40.097
Look.

57:40.298 --> 57:42.858
- Is that you?
- Yes.

57:43.034 --> 57:44.661
And that was Jack.

57:45.804 --> 57:47.271
He's so handsome.

57:47.439 --> 57:51.034
Yes, and very, very serious,
just like Calvin.

57:51.409 --> 57:53.001
- He was a golfer?
- Ruby?

57:53.645 --> 57:55.442
- Wha...? Hey.
- Ruby, bed.

57:55.613 --> 57:56.638
- Right now?
- Yes.

57:56.816 --> 57:58.716
Why won't you take it?

57:58.884 --> 58:00.408
I want you to have it.

58:00.586 --> 58:04.249
- What's going on?
- Calvin won't accept my present.

58:04.423 --> 58:05.549
Why not?

58:05.725 --> 58:08.660
- Mort works hard on his furniture.
- Yeah.

58:08.828 --> 58:12.389
- I call it the Lone Pine.
- That's beautiful.

58:12.565 --> 58:16.228
- Don't you like it?
- Of course, he does. It's a great chair.

58:16.402 --> 58:19.166
Come on, sit down, sit down.
Just feel the wood.

58:19.338 --> 58:20.930
Calvin...

58:42.362 --> 58:44.557
Skinnamarinky dinky dink

58:44.731 --> 58:46.198
Dinky do

58:46.366 --> 58:49.802
I love you

58:49.970 --> 58:52.200
Skinnamarinky dinky dink

58:52.372 --> 58:53.896
Dinky do

58:54.074 --> 58:56.770
I love you

58:57.644 --> 59:00.442
I love you in the morning
And in the afternoon

59:00.614 --> 59:02.309
Honey, I'm trying to read.

59:15.162 --> 59:16.652
Ruby?

59:20.133 --> 59:23.330
You read your stupid book all weekend.

59:24.838 --> 59:27.865
Your mom and Mort were trying so hard.

59:28.042 --> 59:29.839
I'm sorry.

59:41.689 --> 59:44.249
You don't have any friends.

59:44.592 --> 59:46.025
I have you.

59:46.527 --> 59:48.757
I don't need anyone else.

59:49.497 --> 59:51.692
That's a lot of pressure.

59:54.435 --> 59:58.838
- I'm so lonely.
- No. Don't say that. Please.

01:00:02.009 --> 01:00:03.033
What do we do?

01:00:04.946 --> 01:00:07.141
How do we make it better?

01:00:09.050 --> 01:00:12.282
- Maybe I could take an art class.
- Great.

01:00:12.454 --> 01:00:16.515
An art class. Get out of the house.
It's good.

01:00:17.559 --> 01:00:21.928
And I think I should start spending
some nights at my apartment again.

01:00:22.397 --> 01:00:24.331
Your apartment?

01:00:25.434 --> 01:00:27.061
One night a week.

01:00:27.636 --> 01:00:29.661
As an experiment.

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:35.073
Okay.

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:50.954
Hi, Scotty. Come here.

01:00:56.166 --> 01:00:57.861
The teacher's just amazing.

01:00:58.034 --> 01:01:03.028
It's kind of an older group,
but the talent level's really high.

01:01:03.506 --> 01:01:05.838
I think I'm gonna learn a lot.

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.205
- How was your night?
- Terrible.

01:01:12.382 --> 01:01:14.213
I'm sorry.

01:01:14.384 --> 01:01:17.376
I don't think this experiment
is gonna work for me.

01:01:18.922 --> 01:01:21.618
There has to be space
in the relationship.

01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:24.954
Otherwise,
it's like we're the same person.

01:01:25.695 --> 01:01:29.153
Listen, it's one night a week.
I think you can handle it.

01:01:29.766 --> 01:01:31.791
I've gotta take a shower.

01:01:33.803 --> 01:01:35.464
Come on, baby.

01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:55.449
Hello?

01:01:55.626 --> 01:01:57.719
- Hi.
- Hi. Where are you?

01:01:58.162 --> 01:02:03.794
A bunch of people from class
decided to go out, so we're at this bar.

01:02:03.968 --> 01:02:05.560
When you coming home?

01:02:05.736 --> 01:02:08.102
I don't know. We just got here.

01:02:08.572 --> 01:02:10.369
I cooked.

01:02:11.175 --> 01:02:14.508
Sorry, no. You know,
I think that we're just gonna eat here.

01:02:14.678 --> 01:02:16.509
I mean, we already ordered, so...

01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:20.907
So when are you coming home?

01:02:21.085 --> 01:02:25.455
I don't know. Your place is kind of far
and we're drinking, so...

01:02:27.225 --> 01:02:29.989
You know, I might be kind of late.

01:02:30.161 --> 01:02:32.629
Why don't we just see each other
tomorrow?

01:02:35.834 --> 01:02:39.235
- Calvin?
- Yeah.

01:02:39.738 --> 01:02:43.799
Okay. Have a great time.

01:04:17.371 --> 01:04:20.033
Calvin, I wanna come home.

01:04:26.646 --> 01:04:30.013
- No.
- I have to pee.

01:04:30.317 --> 01:04:32.148
Stay.

01:04:58.813 --> 01:05:01.281
I miss you right now.

01:05:05.119 --> 01:05:07.781
Oh, Calvin.

01:05:10.224 --> 01:05:12.954
- I'd rather not talk about it.
- I'm sorry.

01:05:13.327 --> 01:05:15.192
I always thought you walked alone.

01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:18.531
No man walks alone from choice.

01:05:21.103 --> 01:05:23.196
- Where are you going?
- To get the phone.

01:05:23.372 --> 01:05:25.397
Can I come with you?

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:43.148
Two for the 7:45.

01:05:43.325 --> 01:05:45.987
It's sold out. There's a 9:00.

01:05:46.395 --> 01:05:48.488
Take a walk first?

01:05:49.798 --> 01:05:51.663
Two for the 9.

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.369
Look at this.

01:06:12.155 --> 01:06:13.179
Hello?

01:06:13.356 --> 01:06:15.290
Look who answered their phone.

01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:17.790
Cyrus, hey. Sorry, I've been busy.

01:06:17.961 --> 01:06:21.226
- No worries, man. Busy writing?
- Yeah.

01:06:21.397 --> 01:06:24.491
Yeah? Good, that's great.
I keep telling them you're working on it.

01:06:24.667 --> 01:06:27.192
The publishers are getting anxious
about the new book...

01:06:27.370 --> 01:06:28.394
Right, the new book.

01:06:28.571 --> 01:06:32.268
- You seemed excited about it a while back...
- I'm out right now...

01:06:32.442 --> 01:06:35.104
Any progress since then?
Can I give them some time line...?

01:06:35.278 --> 01:06:38.042
- Cyrus, I'm gonna call you back.
- What?

01:06:40.283 --> 01:06:42.046
Ruby?

01:06:47.358 --> 01:06:49.019
Ruby!

01:06:53.864 --> 01:06:55.855
Ruby!

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:07.437
Hey. Hey, hey. What happened?
I turned around and you were gone.

01:07:07.611 --> 01:07:09.841
- You let go of my hand.
- I... What?

01:07:10.014 --> 01:07:11.845
You let go of my hand.

01:07:12.016 --> 01:07:15.611
What...? I had to pick up the phone.

01:07:15.786 --> 01:07:18.380
- I know, but you let go.
- Ruby.

01:07:18.822 --> 01:07:22.622
You didn't even notice I was gone.

01:07:23.093 --> 01:07:24.720
Ruby.

01:07:24.895 --> 01:07:27.887
Sweetie, you have to calm down.

01:07:31.068 --> 01:07:34.527
- I'm gonna get you some water, okay?
- No.

01:07:35.173 --> 01:07:37.232
- No.
- I'll be right back.

01:08:07.906 --> 01:08:09.897
Hi, dummy.

01:08:12.277 --> 01:08:13.767
Hi.

01:08:15.848 --> 01:08:21.444
He's chasing me... No.

01:08:21.787 --> 01:08:25.279
Miles. Yay, Miles.

01:08:25.457 --> 01:08:27.483
- Thanks.
- He's a water baby.

01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:29.719
- Can I ask something?
- I'm coming to get you.

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:31.055
Shoot.

01:08:32.665 --> 01:08:35.657
- What if I told you I was writing again?
- Oh, no, he kicked me.

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:36.995
Hey, that's fantastic.

01:08:37.603 --> 01:08:40.231
What's it about?

01:08:41.506 --> 01:08:43.134
Writing again.

01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:46.107
All right! Meow! Meow! Meow!

01:08:46.278 --> 01:08:48.508
- Oh. Hi.
- How's it going?

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.705
Good.

01:08:49.881 --> 01:08:51.816
- Her tits?
- No.

01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:54.982
She wasn't happy.

01:08:56.221 --> 01:08:58.520
- So I made her happy...
- I'm a queen!

01:08:58.691 --> 01:09:00.523
And now she's like this all the time.

01:09:02.696 --> 01:09:05.493
What are you asking me?
If it's moral? I don't know.

01:09:06.099 --> 01:09:08.363
It's obviously working.

01:09:08.801 --> 01:09:09.996
Think of it like Prozac.

01:09:10.337 --> 01:09:13.828
- But how do I know it's real?
- It's not, okay? She's not.

01:09:14.006 --> 01:09:15.872
She I... She was.

01:09:16.042 --> 01:09:17.840
Oh, no.

01:09:18.011 --> 01:09:20.707
- I want to be what's making her happy...
- I love you, baby.

01:09:20.881 --> 01:09:22.781
Without making her happy.

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:25.643
So write "Ruby went back to normal."
No big deal.

01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:28.344
I'm a puppy dog swimming in the water.

01:09:28.522 --> 01:09:30.513
I think she was gonna leave me before.

01:09:30.691 --> 01:09:34.559
Help. Help.

01:09:38.598 --> 01:09:40.691
Susie left once.

01:09:41.001 --> 01:09:44.233
When? Why didn't you tell me?

01:09:44.404 --> 01:09:46.600
You had a lot going on.

01:09:46.774 --> 01:09:47.798
And she came back.

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:50.871
But I still think about it.

01:09:51.045 --> 01:09:52.910
I could lose her any moment.

01:10:13.601 --> 01:10:16.161
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

01:10:19.674 --> 01:10:22.700
I'm thinking about going away
for a few months.

01:10:22.877 --> 01:10:25.869
- By myself.
- Where do you wanna go?

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:31.380
I don't know. Somewhere far.

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.118
You could send me postcards.
I love getting mail.

01:10:37.726 --> 01:10:41.127
Or I might hole up here in the house,
not even go outside.

01:10:41.296 --> 01:10:42.786
Cool.

01:10:42.965 --> 01:10:45.798
We could build a pillow fort.

01:11:24.207 --> 01:11:26.903
This is your proving
ground. Start with you, Michelle.

01:11:27.076 --> 01:11:29.442
- Yes.
- You have a superior walk.

01:11:29.612 --> 01:11:31.944
- I can see you doing runway, but...
- Thank you.

01:11:32.115 --> 01:11:34.106
What are you doing?
We have Langdon's party.

01:11:34.284 --> 01:11:35.876
- Who?
- Langdon Tharp.

01:11:36.052 --> 01:11:39.044
- The writer. His book party's tonight.
- Hey, I was watching that.

01:11:39.222 --> 01:11:41.554
- Yeah, for days.
- It's a marathon.

01:11:41.724 --> 01:11:44.318
You were always asking me
to make plans for us. I did.

01:11:44.494 --> 01:11:48.260
Don't quote me to myself.
I am allowed to change my mind.

01:11:48.431 --> 01:11:52.663
- I don't want to fight about this.
- Fine, great! Let's ignore it, then.

01:11:52.836 --> 01:11:55.361
Now look at Sheila.
Sheila has such a unique look.

01:11:55.538 --> 01:11:58.372
And I think that's wonderful.
We've all noticed it.

01:12:00.144 --> 01:12:01.839
We love your energy.

01:12:02.012 --> 01:12:05.140
Sally made a really interesting
choice using that big tease...

01:12:05.316 --> 01:12:06.374
but it was too much.

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:09.110
She's not afraid to be bold.

01:12:15.893 --> 01:12:17.952
I'm sorry.

01:12:21.732 --> 01:12:25.168
Everything's been so up and down lately,
you know?

01:12:27.304 --> 01:12:30.865
It's like my internal compass
is just gone.

01:12:34.979 --> 01:12:36.810
Maybe I should talk to someone.

01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:39.973
You used to see someone, didn't you?

01:12:40.150 --> 01:12:42.517
Dr. Rosenthal.

01:12:43.054 --> 01:12:45.454
Maybe you should go back.

01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:48.455
I thought we were talking about you.

01:12:50.028 --> 01:12:53.191
Yeah, yeah, we are.

01:12:54.432 --> 01:12:57.595
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I just need to get out.

01:12:57.769 --> 01:13:00.431
See people. Be social.

01:13:01.973 --> 01:13:03.838
This party's gonna be fun.

01:13:09.681 --> 01:13:12.548
Langdon. Hey, Langdon, hey.

01:13:12.717 --> 01:13:14.412
Welcome to my cult.

01:13:14.586 --> 01:13:17.714
- Cal, you have to talk to Adam and Mandi.
- Who?

01:13:17.889 --> 01:13:20.756
Adam and Mandi. The producers
who wanna take over your option.

01:13:20.926 --> 01:13:23.622
- Please, check your messages.
- Cyrus, this is Ruby.

01:13:23.795 --> 01:13:25.320
- Hi.
- Ruby.

01:13:25.498 --> 01:13:27.227
Cyrus. Nice.

01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:28.924
- This is Saskia.
- Hi.

01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:30.728
- Okay. Come.
- Hi.

01:13:30.903 --> 01:13:33.201
Stay there, I'll be right back.

01:13:36.776 --> 01:13:38.744
You wanna write
the screenplay yourself?

01:13:38.911 --> 01:13:41.539
Oh, of course. Yes, absolutely.
Who else would?

01:13:41.714 --> 01:13:43.682
I don't know. I've never written one.

01:13:43.849 --> 01:13:46.511
My God, you're such a genius,
you'd pick it up like that.

01:13:46.686 --> 01:13:49.280
- I've been telling him that.
- He doesn't like that word.

01:13:49.455 --> 01:13:50.888
Who'd you wanna play Charlie?

01:13:51.057 --> 01:13:53.287
- I mean, that's the question, right?
- Yeah.

01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:01.863
You should come
and talk to me about it sometime.

01:14:10.644 --> 01:14:14.080
Now, Adam and Mandi come in
with experience from documentary films.

01:14:14.247 --> 01:14:15.407
Yeah.

01:14:15.582 --> 01:14:18.050
Everything they touch is authentic.
They make it real.

01:14:18.218 --> 01:14:21.517
- Grounded in reality and...
- We treat narrative the exact same way...

01:14:21.688 --> 01:14:23.747
- You saw the baby documentary they did.
- Yes.

01:14:23.924 --> 01:14:26.017
- Okay. Genius.
- Made me wanna have a kid.

01:14:26.193 --> 01:14:28.787
You have no idea how many people
told us the same thing.

01:14:28.962 --> 01:14:31.692
- Well, it's true.
- Can you hold this just for a second?

01:14:31.865 --> 01:14:34.129
- No, sorry, I'll be right back.
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:14:34.301 --> 01:14:35.598
- Great to talk to you.
- Okay.

01:14:35.769 --> 01:14:37.066
- Talk to you in a bit.
- Okay.

01:14:37.237 --> 01:14:39.398
- See you later. Yeah, great.
- Okay.

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:42.608
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:14:45.012 --> 01:14:47.776
- Cal.
- Lila.

01:14:50.017 --> 01:14:51.609
I thought you were in New York.

01:14:51.785 --> 01:14:55.017
No, Landgon's helping me
publish my novel.

01:14:55.823 --> 01:14:57.290
You finished your novel.

01:14:57.458 --> 01:15:01.758
I know, it's a big surprise, the...
The dilettante finished something, right?

01:15:02.096 --> 01:15:03.120
I never said that.

01:15:04.532 --> 01:15:07.831
- What about you? Are you writing?
- Sure.

01:15:08.002 --> 01:15:10.971
Good. Great.

01:15:11.572 --> 01:15:14.234
- I hear you're seeing someone?
- Yeah. She's here.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.036
Excuse me.

01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.768
- Is she a writer?
- No.

01:15:17.945 --> 01:15:19.845
No, a painter.

01:15:20.014 --> 01:15:24.041
That's great. It's very unthreatening.

01:15:25.486 --> 01:15:27.420
You think I was threatened by you?

01:15:28.089 --> 01:15:30.557
No, Cal, why would you be?
You're a genius.

01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:37.865
You like my pool?

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:42.169
- Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

01:15:42.771 --> 01:15:45.103
What are you doing at my party?

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:47.805
You tell me.

01:15:48.077 --> 01:15:49.510
You come with someone?

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.976
Calvin Weir-Fields.

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.411
The boy wonder.

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:58.519
So are you one of those girls
who only dates famous writers?

01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:01.182
Why? Are you a famous writer?

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:04.049
Do you happen to have a name?

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:07.593
- Ruby.
- Ruby.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:09.959
And what do you do, Ruby?

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:12.460
Nothing.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:17.969
How refreshing.
What do you do in your spare time?

01:16:20.642 --> 01:16:22.543
Not much.

01:16:23.313 --> 01:16:26.578
You know, I was thinking,
I was just thinking...

01:16:26.749 --> 01:16:29.343
tonight would be perfect for a swim.

01:16:30.019 --> 01:16:31.987
I don't have a suit.

01:16:33.389 --> 01:16:35.516
Is that a problem?

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:41.328
Never mind. I don't know why
I thought maybe you'd be happy for me.

01:16:41.498 --> 01:16:43.363
How was I anything but supportive?

01:16:43.533 --> 01:16:45.660
I read every draft.
I took you into my group.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:47.803
- I introduced you to Langdon.
- Begrudgingly.

01:16:47.971 --> 01:16:50.565
- What? I literally can't hear you.
- Begrudgingly.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.867
You weren't curious about me.
You never were.

01:16:53.543 --> 01:16:55.511
You just had this image of who I was.

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:58.841
And anything that I did
that contradicted it, you just ignored.

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:01.813
What image? Where you left me
as soon as I wasn't successful?

01:17:01.985 --> 01:17:05.284
You think I gave a shit
if you were famous?

01:17:06.023 --> 01:17:09.151
All that I wanted was for you,
I don't know, to care about me.

01:17:09.326 --> 01:17:12.159
Care about you?
You left weeks after my father died.

01:17:12.329 --> 01:17:14.229
- Do you wanna talk about caring?
- Oh, God.

01:17:14.398 --> 01:17:16.832
- Do you know what people say?
- You were impenetrable.

01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:19.196
- "How'd you love that person?"
- I tried to help.

01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:22.430
- You refused to let me in.
- And I say, "I have no fucking clue!"

01:17:27.278 --> 01:17:32.113
The only person that you wanted to be
in a relationship with was you.

01:17:34.451 --> 01:17:36.282
So I let you do that.

01:17:38.989 --> 01:17:41.981
You really let yourself off the hook,
don't you?

01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:47.395
- Goodbye, Cal.
- Goodbye.

01:17:48.065 --> 01:17:49.999
Have a great life.

01:17:50.802 --> 01:17:52.736
Come on.
It's nice and warm. Swim to me.

01:17:53.205 --> 01:17:55.605
You can keep your underwear on
if you like.

01:17:55.774 --> 01:17:56.866
Come on in.

01:17:57.609 --> 01:18:00.840
- No peeking.
- All right, I promise, I won't peek.

01:18:01.012 --> 01:18:02.775
All right.

01:18:05.050 --> 01:18:06.642
Oh, boy.

01:18:10.388 --> 01:18:12.948
Writing is sensual. It's...

01:18:13.458 --> 01:18:15.892
You should see me when I write.
I'm like an Olympian.

01:18:16.061 --> 01:18:18.188
- Oh, really?
- I wield my pen...

01:18:18.363 --> 01:18:20.092
- Your pen?
- ...like a lightsaber.

01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:23.063
- What's going on here?
- Calvin.

01:18:23.235 --> 01:18:25.726
We... We thought we'd take a dip.

01:18:27.239 --> 01:18:29.469
Care to join us?

01:18:42.488 --> 01:18:44.422
- What was that?
- What was what?

01:18:44.590 --> 01:18:46.524
- You know what.
- Grow up.

01:18:46.692 --> 01:18:48.387
Scotty.

01:18:48.828 --> 01:18:51.228
- Hey.
- Hey! You're hurting me.

01:18:51.397 --> 01:18:53.024
Explain what you were doing.

01:18:53.199 --> 01:18:55.861
You left me alone at a party
where I didn't know anyone.

01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:59.300
- I found someone to talk to.
- In your underwear.

01:18:59.472 --> 01:19:01.804
Would you have been mad
if I had been in my bikini?

01:19:01.974 --> 01:19:03.669
You weren't wearing your bikini.

01:19:03.843 --> 01:19:05.333
Do you know what it looked like?

01:19:05.511 --> 01:19:07.775
My agent was there. My ex was there.

01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.671
Lila was there? Why didn't you tell me?

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:13.512
I was too busy getting you
to put your clothes back on.

01:19:13.686 --> 01:19:16.450
- You're supposed to be my girlfriend.
- I am your girlfriend.

01:19:16.622 --> 01:19:17.646
So act like it.

01:19:17.823 --> 01:19:21.351
I'm sorry I wasn't acting
like the platonic ideal of your girlfriend.

01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:24.754
Jesus, you can be such a fucking prude.

01:19:24.931 --> 01:19:26.831
I don't want you skinny-dipping
with men?

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.798
Because you don't want me
doing anything!

01:19:29.970 --> 01:19:32.666
You have all these rules
and you don't tell me what they are...

01:19:32.839 --> 01:19:34.704
until, whoops, I've broken one.

01:19:34.875 --> 01:19:37.400
And then you get to be disappointed
with me?

01:19:37.577 --> 01:19:39.238
Okay. Do you wanna know my rules?

01:19:39.413 --> 01:19:42.507
Don't fuck other men.
Don't let them think about fucking you.

01:19:42.683 --> 01:19:44.617
Now I'm responsible
for what people think?

01:19:44.785 --> 01:19:48.414
Yes, you are responsible. When you act
a certain way, it leads people on.

01:19:48.588 --> 01:19:52.024
When you take your clothes off at a party,
people think you're a slut.

01:19:52.192 --> 01:19:57.061
So I'd really prefer if you didn't do that.
Is that clear enough for you?

01:19:57.230 --> 01:19:59.198
Fuck you!

01:20:03.071 --> 01:20:05.369
I'm not your child!

01:20:06.407 --> 01:20:09.570
You don't get to decide what I do.

01:20:10.611 --> 01:20:13.341
- Wanna bet?
- What?

01:20:14.415 --> 01:20:17.407
I'm pretty sure I could make you do
whatever I want.

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:22.014
What are you gonna do, Calvin?
Tie me up?

01:20:22.190 --> 01:20:23.680
No.

01:20:25.093 --> 01:20:27.084
I don't have to.

01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:15.870
Calvin...

01:21:18.313 --> 01:21:20.508
I'm gonna call a cab.

01:21:22.184 --> 01:21:24.652
Let's talk tomorrow, okay?

01:21:29.858 --> 01:21:31.588
Calvin.

01:21:35.632 --> 01:21:38.999
Fine. Go.

01:21:42.071 --> 01:21:43.800
Fuck!

01:21:45.909 --> 01:21:47.103
What was that?

01:21:49.446 --> 01:21:51.607
You didn't feel that?

01:22:02.792 --> 01:22:04.555
What is that?

01:22:04.727 --> 01:22:07.355
What the fuck is going on?

01:22:07.997 --> 01:22:09.794
Calvin.

01:22:14.370 --> 01:22:19.638
- Oh, my God, something is happening.
- Here. Read.

01:22:35.526 --> 01:22:37.187
What is this?

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:40.391
My book.

01:22:41.599 --> 01:22:44.500
The one I haven't been working on.

01:22:45.035 --> 01:22:46.730
Wanna see?

01:22:51.342 --> 01:22:53.435
Is this some sort of joke?

01:22:53.611 --> 01:22:57.308
No. It's pretty serious.

01:22:57.481 --> 01:22:59.916
You're writing about me?

01:23:00.485 --> 01:23:03.579
No, you can't write about me.
That's private.

01:23:04.422 --> 01:23:06.982
I'm not writing about you.

01:23:08.126 --> 01:23:09.923
I wrote you.

01:23:10.662 --> 01:23:12.357
I made you up.

01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:17.424
- What?
- I had a dream about a girl.

01:23:19.037 --> 01:23:21.005
So I wrote it down.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:24.070
I gave her a name.

01:23:25.277 --> 01:23:26.835
Ruby.

01:23:27.712 --> 01:23:32.809
I wrote all kinds of things about her
and then one day I woke up and she...

01:23:33.451 --> 01:23:37.615
You were living in my house.

01:23:40.358 --> 01:23:43.088
I can make you do anything...

01:23:43.628 --> 01:23:46.189
because you're not real.

01:23:48.167 --> 01:23:50.226
You're sick.

01:24:04.817 --> 01:24:06.580
Calvin?

01:24:07.486 --> 01:24:09.579
Listen to me.

01:24:10.823 --> 01:24:13.986
If this is how you think about people...

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.689
then you are in for a long,
lonely fucked-up life.

01:24:22.301 --> 01:24:24.997
Do you hear me? Calvin?

01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:45.556
See. "Ruby speaks French."

01:24:56.503 --> 01:24:58.494
I told you I could make you do anything.

01:25:00.974 --> 01:25:02.032
I write it.

01:25:05.512 --> 01:25:06.774
You do it.

01:25:25.199 --> 01:25:29.158
Skinnamarinky dinky dink dinky do

01:25:29.537 --> 01:25:32.904
I love you

01:25:33.074 --> 01:25:35.599
Skinnamarinky dinky dink

01:25:35.943 --> 01:25:37.501
Dinky do

01:25:37.679 --> 01:25:40.580
I love you

01:25:40.748 --> 01:25:42.443
I love you in the morning

01:26:07.409 --> 01:26:08.899
I love you.

01:26:09.078 --> 01:26:11.410
I'll never leave you. I love you.

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.275
I'll never leave you. I love you.

01:26:13.449 --> 01:26:14.541
I'll never leave you.

01:26:14.717 --> 01:26:17.550
I love you. I'll never leave you.

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:19.415
I love your mouth. I love your nose.

01:26:19.988 --> 01:26:22.616
I love your butt. I love your eyes.

01:26:22.791 --> 01:26:24.622
I love your belly. I love your ears.

01:26:24.793 --> 01:26:27.785
I love your cock. I love your nose.

01:26:27.963 --> 01:26:30.056
I love your mouth. I love you so much.

01:26:30.666 --> 01:26:34.158
I'll love you forever
and ever and ever and ever.

01:26:35.304 --> 01:26:41.175
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

01:26:41.344 --> 01:26:48.147
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

01:26:48.318 --> 01:26:52.755
You're a genius.
You're a genius. You're a genius.

01:26:52.922 --> 01:26:56.983
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:00.789
You're a genius. You're a genius.
You're a genius.

01:28:14.573 --> 01:28:16.063
Rub...

01:32:09.612 --> 01:32:11.239
Calvin?

01:32:17.454 --> 01:32:18.978
Calvin.

01:32:20.857 --> 01:32:22.586
You okay?

01:32:25.428 --> 01:32:27.396
She's gone.

01:32:30.233 --> 01:32:32.064
She's gone.

01:32:36.540 --> 01:32:38.531
It's okay, buddy.

01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:04.527
Okay.

01:33:06.403 --> 01:33:08.428
Nothing helps.

01:33:10.574 --> 01:33:14.203
- When was the last time you wrote, Cal?
- I can't write.

01:33:14.612 --> 01:33:16.546
Sure you can.

01:33:16.881 --> 01:33:20.943
That's what you have over every other poor
schmuck out there with a broken heart.

01:33:21.119 --> 01:33:22.950
You can write about it.

01:33:23.121 --> 01:33:25.180
And who would wanna read that?

01:33:25.357 --> 01:33:27.291
Lots of people.

01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:30.487
Why not?

01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:33.325
You got a pretty great story.

01:33:33.498 --> 01:33:36.262
Everyone will think I'm crazy.

01:33:37.502 --> 01:33:39.197
No.

01:33:40.005 --> 01:33:42.235
They'll think it's fiction.

01:34:12.905 --> 01:34:17.308
This is the true and impossible
story of my very great love.

01:34:17.476 --> 01:34:20.639
In the hope that she will not read this
and reproach me...

01:34:20.813 --> 01:34:23.281
I have withheld many telling details.

01:34:24.717 --> 01:34:25.945
Her name...

01:34:26.118 --> 01:34:29.576
the particulars of her birth
and upbringing...

01:34:29.755 --> 01:34:32.588
and any identifying scars
or birthmarks.

01:34:34.393 --> 01:34:38.124
All the same,
I cannot help but write this for her.

01:34:38.898 --> 01:34:40.263
To tell her:

01:34:40.433 --> 01:34:43.960
"I'm sorry for every word
I wrote to change you."

01:34:44.503 --> 01:34:47.439
I'm sorry for so many things.

01:34:48.942 --> 01:34:51.775
I couldn't see you when you were here.

01:34:53.146 --> 01:34:57.480
"And now that you're gone,
I see you everywhere."

01:35:02.623 --> 01:35:04.989
"One may read this and think it's magic..."

01:35:05.158 --> 01:35:08.457
but falling in love
is an act of magic.

01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:10.654
So is writing.

01:35:11.231 --> 01:35:13.597
It was once said of Catcher in the Rye:

01:35:13.767 --> 01:35:17.362
'That rare miracle of fiction
has again come to pass.

01:35:18.105 --> 01:35:24.476
A human being has been created
out of ink, paper and the imagination.'

01:35:25.045 --> 01:35:27.639
I am no J.D. Salinger...

01:35:27.981 --> 01:35:30.108
but I have witnessed a rare miracle.

01:35:31.986 --> 01:35:33.817
Any writer can attest...

01:35:33.988 --> 01:35:36.320
in the luckiest, happiest state...

01:35:36.491 --> 01:35:40.359
the words are not coming from you,
but through you.

01:35:41.729 --> 01:35:44.562
She came to me wholly herself.

01:35:46.301 --> 01:35:49.862
"I was just lucky enough to be there
to catch her."

01:35:52.707 --> 01:35:54.265
Thank you.

01:36:05.219 --> 01:36:08.655
Doesn't his imagination
just blow you away?

01:36:08.823 --> 01:36:11.257
I mean, where does he come up
with these ideas?

01:36:11.426 --> 01:36:13.018
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:36:13.294 --> 01:36:15.388
- Genius.
- I don't know.

01:36:15.898 --> 01:36:17.160
I don't know.

01:36:17.333 --> 01:36:18.425
- How are you?
- What's up?

01:36:21.437 --> 01:36:23.905
It's beautiful, Calvin.

01:36:24.239 --> 01:36:25.263
Thank you.

01:36:25.441 --> 01:36:29.969
Most of my patients don't take
my assignments this seriously.

01:36:30.145 --> 01:36:34.844
I know you hoped that, by writing this,
I would realize that it never happened.

01:36:35.017 --> 01:36:36.041
That I imagined her.

01:36:38.153 --> 01:36:40.280
But the thing is...

01:36:42.024 --> 01:36:44.822
I don't need to make sense of this.

01:36:45.861 --> 01:36:49.627
I don't care
if there's no good explanation.

01:36:50.366 --> 01:36:52.391
I need you to believe me anyway.

01:36:54.203 --> 01:36:56.068
Just take the leap.

01:36:56.739 --> 01:36:59.538
At least imagine how it could be true.

01:37:00.009 --> 01:37:01.806
For me.

01:37:02.545 --> 01:37:04.308
I'll work on that.

01:37:09.219 --> 01:37:11.050
Go potty.

01:37:11.554 --> 01:37:13.545
Go potty.

01:37:15.625 --> 01:37:17.149
Scotty. Scotty.

01:37:19.929 --> 01:37:21.794
Scotty.

01:37:22.565 --> 01:37:24.328
Scotty.

01:37:25.001 --> 01:37:27.936
- Oh, hi.
- Sorry.

01:37:28.104 --> 01:37:29.332
- Hi.
- Sorry, he's mine.

01:37:29.506 --> 01:37:31.838
It's fine. He's so friendly.

01:37:35.812 --> 01:37:38.645
- What's his name?
- Scotty.

01:37:38.815 --> 01:37:41.807
Scotty. That's funny, that's...

01:37:41.985 --> 01:37:44.682
That's the name of the dog in this book.

01:37:44.855 --> 01:37:46.083
Have you read it?

01:37:49.660 --> 01:37:51.525
Did you like it?

01:37:54.331 --> 01:37:56.595
Sorry. Did you say something?

01:37:56.767 --> 01:37:59.497
Yeah, I just asked if you liked it.

01:37:59.670 --> 01:38:01.137
What do you think?

01:38:01.906 --> 01:38:05.672
My friend who lent it to me thought
it was kind of pretentious...

01:38:05.843 --> 01:38:08.107
but I really like it so far.

01:38:13.317 --> 01:38:15.547
Have we met before?

01:38:17.621 --> 01:38:19.987
I don't know.

01:38:21.392 --> 01:38:23.883
You seem really familiar.

01:38:25.563 --> 01:38:28.089
Maybe we knew each other
in another life.

01:38:28.266 --> 01:38:31.292
Or maybe we just go
to the same coffee shop.

01:38:32.838 --> 01:38:35.705
What do you do
besides go for walks with your dog?

01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:40.935
I'm a writer.

01:38:41.112 --> 01:38:42.909
What do you write?

01:38:46.651 --> 01:38:49.518
So that's why you look so familiar.

01:38:50.222 --> 01:38:51.621
Maybe.

01:38:51.790 --> 01:38:54.350
I was kidding about
my friend calling it pretentious.

01:38:54.526 --> 01:38:56.050
It's okay.

01:39:00.031 --> 01:39:01.191
Can we start over?

01:39:03.768 --> 01:39:05.099
Yes.

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:15.406
- May I sit down?
- Oh, please.

01:39:28.861 --> 01:39:31.625
Just don't tell me how it ends, okay?

01:39:34.033 --> 01:39:35.660
Promise.

01:39:36.305 --> 01:39:42.879
