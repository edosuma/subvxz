00:14.279 --> 00:17.047
You want me to blow up
a couple of dozen FBI agents?

00:17.115 --> 00:18.782
You got a problem with that?

00:18.850 --> 00:20.517
<i>Agent Walker,
this is Jack.</i>

00:20.585 --> 00:22.386
Get your men out of the building--
It's a trap.

00:26.090 --> 00:27.258
You got the canister?

00:29.394 --> 00:31.629
Clearly, Hodges
is behind this.

00:31.696 --> 00:33.397
I want him taken
to the FBI

00:33.465 --> 00:34.598
for interrogation.

00:34.666 --> 00:35.932
He's a sociopath, Mom.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.401
He's not going to talk--
he's going to want

00:37.469 --> 00:39.570
to make some kind of deal
in exchange for his cooperation.

00:39.638 --> 00:41.705
Mom, you're not
considering that.
Olivia...

00:41.773 --> 00:44.275
You know what this man is,
what he did to Roger.

00:44.342 --> 00:46.810
I've upset the cart, have I?

00:46.878 --> 00:48.612
That bioweapon that
you developed

00:48.680 --> 00:50.781
for us was not intended
for personal use.

00:50.848 --> 00:51.915
I think we can
both agree

00:51.983 --> 00:53.751
that there's no reason
for your family

00:53.818 --> 00:55.118
to pay for
your mistakes.

00:55.186 --> 00:56.987
This will induce
a cardiac arrest

00:57.054 --> 00:58.622
and leave no trace
in your system.

01:04.929 --> 01:07.864
We are rerouting
to West Arlington Hospital.

01:07.932 --> 01:10.100
Have you heard from Almeida?

01:10.168 --> 01:12.002
<i>I called him before I met
with Hodges.</i>

01:12.069 --> 01:13.804
Has he secured the canister?

01:13.871 --> 01:14.805
Soon.
He's your guy.

01:14.872 --> 01:16.106
He better not screw this up.

01:16.174 --> 01:18.342
<i>I have faith
he'll come through.</i>

01:19.744 --> 01:20.711
Why don't you go back
to FBI Medical

01:20.779 --> 01:22.946
and let them
treat you?

01:23.014 --> 01:24.448
There is no treatment.

01:24.516 --> 01:25.882
There is no cure.

01:25.950 --> 01:27.217
Almost like
they knew, Jack.

01:27.285 --> 01:28.218
They would have
needed time

01:28.286 --> 01:29.320
to wire this building
with explosives.

01:29.387 --> 01:31.087
This is the last sector
we were due to search.

01:31.155 --> 01:32.790
Jack, what is it?

01:34.192 --> 01:35.426
What is your involvement?

01:35.493 --> 01:36.627
You're not thinking straight.

01:36.695 --> 01:38.662
The toxin's starting
to affect your judgment.

01:38.730 --> 01:40.631
Now, why don't you
put the gun down.
Don't you move!

01:44.101 --> 01:46.269
I never wanted to
hurt you, Jack.

01:46.338 --> 01:47.805
I told you to stay out of it.

01:47.872 --> 01:48.905
We get some help here?

01:48.973 --> 01:50.507
This man's having a seizure.

02:17.275 --> 02:19.209
Mr. Bauer, you should be
feeling better already.

02:19.277 --> 02:21.345
I'm giving you five CC's
of intravenous pendopamine.

02:21.413 --> 02:22.612
It'll de-constrict
your muscles.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.780
Just hang in there.

02:24.916 --> 02:25.916
Don't talk.

02:25.983 --> 02:27.684
Your vocal cords
are in spasm.

02:27.752 --> 02:29.053
What the hell happened?

02:29.120 --> 02:30.421
Tony Almeida found him
in full seizure.

02:30.488 --> 02:31.855
What about the medication
pack you gave him?

02:31.923 --> 02:33.223
Wasn't carrying it.

02:33.291 --> 02:34.525
S-s-stop.

02:34.592 --> 02:35.992
Mr. Bauer,
please don't speak.

02:36.061 --> 02:37.061
Stop...

02:37.128 --> 02:38.262
Tony...

02:38.329 --> 02:39.396
Tony?

02:39.464 --> 02:40.697
I don't understand.

02:40.765 --> 02:42.933
He's... second man.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.868
Jack, what...
Put out an APB.

02:44.936 --> 02:46.403
How do you
know this?

02:46.471 --> 02:48.238
Do it!

02:48.306 --> 02:50.307
Attention, all patrols
and perimeter teams,

02:50.375 --> 02:51.475
this is Alpha One.

02:51.543 --> 02:53.544
I'm issuing a priority APB
on Tony Almeida.

02:53.611 --> 02:54.744
Approach with extreme caution.

02:54.812 --> 02:55.912
He's colluding
with Galvez

02:55.980 --> 02:56.980
and should be
considered hostile.

02:57.048 --> 02:58.348
All units who engage the suspect

02:58.416 --> 03:01.017
should do so
with extreme caution.

03:22.107 --> 03:25.709
You really need to give yourself
more time to recover.

03:25.776 --> 03:27.211
Here's another med pack.

03:27.278 --> 03:28.778
Make sure he doesn't lose it.

03:28.846 --> 03:31.482
I need to go tend
to the other wounded.

03:33.284 --> 03:35.652
All right, tell me what
the hell is going on.

03:38.723 --> 03:41.758
Tony was working with Galvez
all along.

03:42.893 --> 03:44.794
He used us, all of us,
so that he

03:44.862 --> 03:46.163
could get to the canister.

03:46.231 --> 03:47.964
So, wait, what
are you saying,

03:48.032 --> 03:49.500
that...

03:49.567 --> 03:52.236
Tony killed Larry?

03:53.271 --> 03:54.771
Yeah.

03:54.839 --> 03:56.406
They must have
ambushed him

03:56.474 --> 03:58.242
as the chopper
was setting down.

03:58.309 --> 04:01.478
Tony stayed behind so he
could monitor our search,

04:01.546 --> 04:03.313
set the trap
and make sure Galvez

04:03.381 --> 04:04.515
could get beyond
the perimeter.

04:04.582 --> 04:06.116
Oh, God.

04:06.184 --> 04:07.851
I'm so sorry.

04:08.919 --> 04:11.321
This is my fault.

04:11.389 --> 04:14.491
I vouched for him to you,
to the president.

04:16.726 --> 04:20.297
I made a terrible,
terrible mistake.

04:20.365 --> 04:22.065
I felt that something
was wrong.g.

04:22.132 --> 04:23.500
Things weren't adding up.

04:23.568 --> 04:25.202
I just...

04:27.205 --> 04:28.539
I just wanted to believe him.

04:28.606 --> 04:30.974
Alpha One, this is Agent Kilner.

04:31.042 --> 04:32.609
Alpha One-- go ahead.

04:32.677 --> 04:35.245
Agent Walker,
I'm at checkpoint Delta.

04:35.313 --> 04:37.281
I've got two agents dead,
shot point-blank.

04:37.348 --> 04:38.515
Their vehicle
is missing.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.284
Okay, he's made it
past the perimeter.

04:40.351 --> 04:42.886
Tracking on the vehicle has been
disabled-- position is unknown.

04:42.953 --> 04:44.888
Widen the perimeter,
and keep looking for Almeida.

04:44.955 --> 04:46.723
If we lose him,
we lose the canister.

04:46.791 --> 04:47.991
Copy that.

04:48.059 --> 04:50.294
You're not gonna find him--
he's gone.

04:50.361 --> 04:51.961
We need to phone the president.

04:52.029 --> 04:53.163
Let's go.

05:12.483 --> 05:15.519
??

05:34.572 --> 05:36.773
You made it.

05:36.841 --> 05:38.342
You sound surprised.

05:38.409 --> 05:41.278
After Bauer called you out,
I wasn't sure you would.

05:43.180 --> 05:45.482
You don't have to worry
about Jack Bauer.

05:45.550 --> 05:47.718
He's not gonna
be a problem.

05:50.121 --> 05:51.855
So, where is the canister?

05:52.923 --> 05:54.157
Where's the money?

05:56.594 --> 05:58.328
Hey, that was our agreement.

05:58.396 --> 06:00.196
Money first.

06:08.072 --> 06:09.573
There you go.

06:09.641 --> 06:12.476
It's all there,
wired into your account.

06:12.543 --> 06:15.078
You can check
it if you want.

06:15.146 --> 06:17.213
I want.

06:26.023 --> 06:27.957
Everything okay?

06:28.025 --> 06:29.493
Yeah.

06:29.560 --> 06:31.127
So, where is the canister?

06:35.700 --> 06:37.467
Right here.

06:45.242 --> 06:47.844
So, what are you planning
on doing with it?

06:47.912 --> 06:49.913
Not really your
business, is it?

06:49.980 --> 06:51.848
You gonna sell it?

07:01.926 --> 07:03.593
You don't want to do this.

07:03.661 --> 07:05.495
Hey, who's the damn buyer?

07:26.384 --> 07:27.784
Where's the canister?

07:27.852 --> 07:29.586
Where is the
damn canister?!

07:31.255 --> 07:33.990
One of the marines
that was guarding Hodges

07:34.058 --> 07:35.959
noticed he was trying
to swallow something.

07:36.026 --> 07:37.561
He intervened, got
him to the hospital

07:37.628 --> 07:39.763
before the poison could
be completely ingested.

07:39.831 --> 07:41.164
So, he'll survive?

07:41.232 --> 07:42.899
Yes, ma'am, but
the doctors

07:42.967 --> 07:44.434
are surprised he
pulled through.

07:44.502 --> 07:46.670
That's because they never met
the son of a bitch.

07:46.738 --> 07:48.405
How did Hodges get this poison?

07:48.473 --> 07:51.274
We suspect from a woman
who claimed to be his attorney.

07:51.342 --> 07:52.342
Claimed to be?

07:52.410 --> 07:53.643
She was an
impostor.

07:53.711 --> 07:55.812
DC Police found the body
of Hodges' real attorney

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
about five minutes ago.

07:56.947 --> 07:58.147
We're still trying
to determine

07:58.215 --> 07:59.883
how she managed to
breach security.

07:59.950 --> 08:02.151
Madam President, Agent Walker
and Jack Bauer.

08:02.219 --> 08:03.720
Put them through.

08:05.189 --> 08:06.590
This is President Taylor.

08:06.657 --> 08:07.891
I'm here with Tim Woods.

08:07.958 --> 08:08.992
Madam President...

08:09.059 --> 08:10.727
Have you secured the canister?

08:10.795 --> 08:12.095
I'm afraid
not, ma'am.

08:12.162 --> 08:13.930
Our suspect escaped
beyond the perimeter.

08:13.998 --> 08:16.433
I was told that the area
was locked down.

08:16.501 --> 08:17.567
What happened?

08:17.635 --> 08:19.436
He had help, Madam President.

08:19.504 --> 08:20.837
From Tony Almeida.

08:20.905 --> 08:22.539
Almeida?

08:22.607 --> 08:23.774
Yes, ma'am.

08:23.841 --> 08:25.375
He was working for us.

08:25.443 --> 08:26.777
It only appeared
that way.

08:26.844 --> 08:28.545
Apparently, he was
pursuing his own agenda,

08:28.613 --> 08:30.179
trying to get his hands
on the canister.

08:30.247 --> 08:32.081
Madam President, I know
I vouched for him.

08:32.149 --> 08:33.650
All I can tell you
right now

08:33.717 --> 08:35.351
is that I was wrong
and I'm sorry.

08:35.419 --> 08:36.653
Now that we know he
has the canister,

08:36.721 --> 08:38.587
do we have any idea what
he intends to do with it?

08:38.655 --> 08:40.590
No, not yet.
Or where he is?

08:40.658 --> 08:42.025
We're all hands
on deck here, sir,

08:42.092 --> 08:43.393
regrouping to
develop leads.

08:43.461 --> 08:46.062
I may have one.

08:46.130 --> 08:48.164
As Hodges was taken
into custody,

08:48.232 --> 08:50.366
he yelled at me
about some larger group

08:50.435 --> 08:52.536
that would continue on
after his arrest.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.571
Something that I wouldn't
be able to stop.

08:54.639 --> 08:55.972
What do you think
he meant?

08:56.040 --> 08:57.273
Well, all I know
for sure

08:57.341 --> 08:59.208
is that someone doesn't
want Hodges to talk.

08:59.276 --> 09:00.677
Shortly after he
was arrested,

09:00.745 --> 09:01.878
Hodges was visited

09:01.946 --> 09:03.513
by a woman impersonating
his lawyer.

09:03.581 --> 09:05.816
She apparently gave him
some kind of lethal drug,

09:05.883 --> 09:07.116
because ten
minutes later,

09:07.184 --> 09:08.217
he tried to
commit suicide.

09:08.285 --> 09:10.019
<i>Tried to commit
suicide?</i>

09:10.087 --> 09:11.588
Oh, he's still alive.

09:11.656 --> 09:14.223
Jonas Hodges was
completely unrepentant.

09:14.291 --> 09:17.060
Now, this suicide attempt
must have been coerced.

09:17.127 --> 09:18.094
Well, obviously,
they're holding something

09:18.162 --> 09:19.295
over him, most likely
his family.

09:19.363 --> 09:20.497
If that's the case,
Madam President,

09:20.565 --> 09:21.765
we need to talk to him.

09:21.833 --> 09:24.501
Jack, even after everything
that's happened today,

09:24.569 --> 09:27.704
I will not allow any kind
of coercive interrogation.

09:27.772 --> 09:29.806
Madam President, that
won't be necessary.

09:29.874 --> 09:31.374
He'll talk.
How can you be sure?

09:31.442 --> 09:33.443
Because we can offer Hodges
something that he needs.

09:33.511 --> 09:34.744
And what's that?

09:34.812 --> 09:36.480
Proof of death:
we can convince the people

09:36.547 --> 09:37.948
that wanted him dead
that they succeeded.

09:38.015 --> 09:40.416
It's the only way Hodges
can protect his family.

09:40.485 --> 09:41.885
Madam President,
right now,

09:41.953 --> 09:43.487
he's the only
lead we've got.

09:54.465 --> 09:55.499
Hey.

10:01.772 --> 10:04.140
I'll assume that
was necessary.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.675
Don't start with me.

10:05.743 --> 10:07.443
I'm not in the mood.

10:07.512 --> 10:08.945
All right.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.148
Mr. Galvez decided

10:12.216 --> 10:13.884
to hide the canister from me,

10:13.951 --> 10:17.086
so, uh, I had to find out
where it was.

10:20.391 --> 10:22.025
We've got a
delivery to make.

10:22.092 --> 10:23.292
Shall we go?

10:23.360 --> 10:25.028
No, I don't think we should.

10:26.063 --> 10:27.230
They're expecting us.

10:27.297 --> 10:29.566
Yeah, well, the way I see it,

10:29.634 --> 10:32.903
they're gonna take this canister
that I sweated blood for

10:32.970 --> 10:35.438
and sit on it for six months.

10:35.506 --> 10:36.706
Not sit on it.

10:36.774 --> 10:38.341
They're gonna use it
to make more pathogen.

10:38.409 --> 10:40.376
We had 27 canisters;
now we have one.

10:40.444 --> 10:42.045
Yeah, and I say one's enough.

10:43.548 --> 10:45.782
Look...

10:45.850 --> 10:48.852
the government's reeling.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.754
The FBI is stretched thin--

10:50.821 --> 10:52.188
scrambling, making mistakes.

10:52.256 --> 10:54.223
Another attack today
is all we need

10:54.291 --> 10:56.192
to push this thing
right over the edge.

10:56.260 --> 10:59.029
This is no time to pull back.

11:00.798 --> 11:02.632
I say we take that canister,

11:02.700 --> 11:04.801
and finish the job off today.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.207
I don't disagree
with you

11:11.275 --> 11:13.443
but it's not
our decision to make.

11:14.579 --> 11:16.846
Fine.

11:16.914 --> 11:18.014
Then run it by your group

11:18.082 --> 11:20.984
or your gang or whatever
the hell they are.

11:21.052 --> 11:22.418
But they'll know one thing.

11:22.486 --> 11:24.921
You finish your enemy off
when he's down.

11:24.989 --> 11:26.790
You don't let him
get back up and reload.

11:26.857 --> 11:28.725
I guarantee you,
this thing's gonna be

11:28.793 --> 11:30.393
a hell of a lot harder

11:30.461 --> 11:32.095
to pull off six
months from now.

11:32.162 --> 11:35.264
And you can say what
you want about Jonas Hodges,

11:35.332 --> 11:37.266
the fact is,

11:37.334 --> 11:39.235
he gave us an opportunity today.

11:41.271 --> 11:43.840
Let's take it.

11:49.647 --> 11:51.147
I'll contact the group.

11:52.182 --> 11:54.183
Good.

12:10.252 --> 12:11.452
What did she say exactly?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.221
Only that she needs to see you

12:13.289 --> 12:14.488
and that it's urgent.

12:14.556 --> 12:16.490
I heard rumors
about the FBI operation.

12:16.558 --> 12:18.359
I'm sure your mother
will fill you in, ma'am.

12:21.430 --> 12:22.663
Olivia.

12:22.731 --> 12:24.699
Is it true the
FBI perimeter was breached?

12:24.766 --> 12:26.000
I'm afraid so.

12:26.068 --> 12:27.468
The canister is now
outside the cordon.

12:27.536 --> 12:28.970
What are we doing
to get it back?

12:29.038 --> 12:31.206
Tim, would you
excuse us for a moment?

12:31.273 --> 12:32.773
Of course.

12:39.281 --> 12:41.816
What is it?

12:41.884 --> 12:44.319
I need you to call
the Attorney General

12:44.386 --> 12:47.655
and draft a witness protection
agreement for Jonas Hodges.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.291
Witness protection?

12:50.359 --> 12:51.759
You can't be serious.

12:51.827 --> 12:53.962
Less than an hour ago,

12:54.029 --> 12:56.130
Hodges tried to kill himself.

12:56.198 --> 12:58.466
And we all believe that
he must've been coerced.

12:58.533 --> 12:59.667
By whom?

12:59.735 --> 13:01.602
You remember his rant--

13:01.670 --> 13:04.038
that he is a cog
in a larger conspiracy,

13:04.106 --> 13:05.673
that there are others
who will carry on.

13:05.741 --> 13:08.309
You think they're the ones
who took the canister?

13:08.377 --> 13:09.510
Well, we need
to find out.

13:09.578 --> 13:12.080
Which is why we need
to get Hodges to talk.

13:12.147 --> 13:15.449
Olivia, we feel
confident that he will

13:15.517 --> 13:17.718
if we can assure him that
these people will believe

13:17.786 --> 13:20.255
that his suicide attempt
actually succeeded.

13:20.322 --> 13:22.757
We need to make
him disappear.

13:22.824 --> 13:25.093
Which is why I need
the protection agreement.

13:25.160 --> 13:26.961
There is no other way
he'll talk.

13:27.029 --> 13:28.763
Designate him
an enemy combatant,

13:28.830 --> 13:29.931
then treat him like one.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.366
We don't do that.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.800
Not in this administration.

13:32.868 --> 13:35.870
And it's not as if he's
getting a free pass.

13:35.938 --> 13:36.871
He'll be under
federal supervision

13:36.939 --> 13:37.872
for the rest of his life.

13:37.940 --> 13:39.040
Oh, yeah,

13:39.108 --> 13:40.841
on a hundred acre
ranch in Colorado!

13:43.045 --> 13:46.247
This man murdered your son!

13:48.284 --> 13:51.619
My brother.

13:51.686 --> 13:52.787
Not to mention

13:52.854 --> 13:54.755
hundreds of
innocent civilians.

13:54.823 --> 13:56.824
I don't need you
to tell me what he's done.

13:56.892 --> 13:57.926
Apparently you do.

13:57.993 --> 13:59.460
Olivia, stop it!

13:59.528 --> 14:00.828
What would Dad say?

14:00.896 --> 14:02.063
I bet you're afraid to ask.

14:02.131 --> 14:04.632
I said stop!

14:07.736 --> 14:11.172
Do you think that
this is easy for me?

14:11.240 --> 14:14.409
You think it doesn't
tear me apart?

14:16.445 --> 14:19.447
I'm Roger's mother.

14:23.752 --> 14:26.354
But I am also the President
of the United States

14:26.422 --> 14:28.189
and I placed my hand on a Bible

14:28.257 --> 14:30.224
and swore to protect and defend
the Constitution.

14:30.292 --> 14:31.292
You

14:31.360 --> 14:32.560
are my Chief
of Staff.

14:32.627 --> 14:35.529
I need you
to act like one.

14:37.566 --> 14:39.467
Now, Jonas Hodges

14:39.534 --> 14:42.303
is at the FBI, and Jack Bauer
will be there shortly.

14:42.371 --> 14:44.205
I need an agreement drafted.

14:46.241 --> 14:48.242
Do that please.

14:52.647 --> 14:54.582
The plan is
straightforward--

14:54.649 --> 14:56.250
an attack today
this morning

14:56.318 --> 14:58.086
during rush hour
using the bioweapon

14:58.153 --> 15:00.421
that Tony Almeida retrieved
from Starkwood.

15:00.489 --> 15:02.256
You should have each received
a data pack

15:02.324 --> 15:03.757
when you logged on to this call.

15:03.825 --> 15:05.526
Please open it now.

15:05.594 --> 15:08.029
The attack will be attributed
to this man,

15:08.097 --> 15:10.031
Jibraan Al-Zarian--

15:10.099 --> 15:12.233
whose body will be left
at the scene.

15:12.301 --> 15:13.901
The evidence trail
implicating him

15:13.969 --> 15:15.569
will include fabricated e-mails,

15:15.637 --> 15:16.804
phone records,

15:16.872 --> 15:18.906
and a large wire transfer
to his account

15:18.974 --> 15:20.674
via our favorite Yemini bank.

15:20.742 --> 15:22.710
I'm looking
at the briefing materials

15:22.777 --> 15:24.879
and I'm not seeing how this man
is actually connected

15:24.946 --> 15:26.280
to any terrorist group.

15:26.348 --> 15:27.615
He isn't.

15:27.682 --> 15:28.883
As previously discussed,

15:28.950 --> 15:30.718
there are considerable
tactical advantages

15:30.785 --> 15:32.053
to using an innocent.

15:32.121 --> 15:33.621
But what about
his unpredictability?

15:33.688 --> 15:35.756
Al-Zarian has no agenda
of his own.

15:35.824 --> 15:38.893
He'll in fact be easier
to control and manipulate

15:38.960 --> 15:40.895
than a real terrorist.
So what are

15:40.962 --> 15:42.897
the casualty estimates?

15:42.964 --> 15:45.733
Page three describes
the casualties estimates

15:45.800 --> 15:47.101
as well as secondary effects.

15:47.169 --> 15:48.836
As you can see, we've listed...
Hold on.

15:48.904 --> 15:49.937
Forget about

15:50.005 --> 15:51.572
what casualties may
or may not be.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.741
We're talking about launching
a new operation

15:53.808 --> 15:55.243
in the next few hours.

15:55.310 --> 15:56.710
Without any planning.

15:56.778 --> 15:58.279
And with only one canister.

15:58.347 --> 16:00.814
The plan for this operation
was already in place.

16:00.882 --> 16:02.616
We'd just be accelerating
the timetable.

16:02.684 --> 16:04.352
We were going to have six months
to prepare.

16:04.420 --> 16:06.620
There's no way to pull it
together in a few hours.

16:06.688 --> 16:08.256
I believe there is.

16:08.323 --> 16:10.258
With the support of this group.

16:10.325 --> 16:11.426
Support for whom?

16:11.493 --> 16:13.227
This Tony Almeida
we barely know?

16:13.295 --> 16:14.595
And what about postattack plans?

16:14.663 --> 16:15.996
How's this

16:16.065 --> 16:18.433
group going to end up
where we need to be?

16:18.500 --> 16:20.535
I agree. How we handle
ourselves politically

16:20.602 --> 16:22.570
in the aftermath of this event

16:22.637 --> 16:24.638
is just as important
as the attack itself.

16:24.706 --> 16:25.806
It always has been.

16:25.874 --> 16:26.974
In your opinion,

16:27.042 --> 16:28.642
is there time then to achieve

16:28.710 --> 16:30.778
all our objectives
in the current scenario?

16:30.845 --> 16:32.580
Not with the same level
of certainty.

16:32.647 --> 16:33.981
Or anonymity.

16:34.049 --> 16:35.249
That's right.

16:35.317 --> 16:37.518
Well, then, maybe it's,
uh, definitive.

16:37.586 --> 16:38.586
What do you mean?

16:38.653 --> 16:39.987
There's no downside
to waiting.

16:40.055 --> 16:42.022
There's a huge downside
to going in unprepared.

16:42.091 --> 16:44.459
Things go wrong,

16:44.526 --> 16:46.461
we're looking at exposure--

16:46.528 --> 16:47.861
for all of us.

16:47.929 --> 16:50.030
No, no, I still don't see it
that way.

16:50.099 --> 16:52.032
Gentlemen.

16:52.101 --> 16:54.068
Ladies.

16:54.136 --> 16:56.237
I've listened to your comments

16:56.305 --> 16:58.272
and there's wisdom

16:58.340 --> 17:00.708
in what I've heard.

17:00.775 --> 17:03.344
But there's also wisdom in
something I haven't heard.

17:03.412 --> 17:05.346
Jonas Hodges was a loose cannon,

17:05.414 --> 17:07.948
and the group
is well rid of him.

17:08.016 --> 17:10.984
But, in his lunacy,
he did us a favor.

17:11.051 --> 17:13.887
He did half our job for us.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.888
More than half.

17:15.957 --> 17:18.459
He pushed this country
to the brink.

17:18.527 --> 17:22.363
You don't get many gifts
like that.

17:23.397 --> 17:25.398
I say we take it.

17:27.068 --> 17:29.003
We have a quorum,

17:29.070 --> 17:31.205
I'd like to call
for an immediate vote.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.455
Tony.

17:51.260 --> 17:52.393
How'd it go?

17:52.461 --> 17:54.462
Take a look.

18:01.637 --> 18:03.771
We're a go.

18:32.053 --> 18:33.653
Where's Hodges now?
Down the hall.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.655
We've set up a medical
suite in Secure Z.

18:35.723 --> 18:37.157
And the death
certificate?

18:37.225 --> 18:38.525
Done.

18:38.592 --> 18:40.560
As far as the world knows,
he's molding on a slab

18:40.628 --> 18:42.562
at the coroner's.
Keep it that way.

18:42.630 --> 18:44.064
No one knows
he's alive

18:44.132 --> 18:45.933
unless they have to.
No, just
the ambulance driver,

18:46.000 --> 18:47.367
the medical team
and three security.

18:47.435 --> 18:48.535
All trustworthy.

18:48.602 --> 18:49.569
Wait.

18:49.637 --> 18:51.004
Are you sure he's up for this?

18:51.072 --> 18:52.139
I know what happened out there.

18:52.206 --> 18:53.473
Medication worked.
He'll be okay.

18:53.541 --> 18:54.774
I'm not talking
about the seizure.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.776
I'm talking about
the Tony Almeida situation.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.211
What about it?

18:58.279 --> 19:00.280
His former partner betrays him,

19:00.348 --> 19:01.714
he tries
to have you all killed--

19:01.782 --> 19:04.117
Jack must have some feelings
about that.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.618
Yeah.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.687
Yeah, I think it's what's
keeping him going.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.558
Listen to me.

19:11.625 --> 19:12.892
Listen to me.

19:12.961 --> 19:14.894
Is anyone listening?

19:14.963 --> 19:15.895
I know you're watching.

19:15.964 --> 19:17.897
I see the cameras!

19:17.966 --> 19:19.632
I know you're watching.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.135
Do you realize
what you people have done?

19:22.203 --> 19:23.170
You didn't save me,

19:23.237 --> 19:25.005
you killed my family!

19:25.073 --> 19:26.273
You killed my family!

19:26.341 --> 19:28.008
You killed them!

19:28.076 --> 19:29.109
Killed them.
How long

19:29.177 --> 19:30.677
has he been
conscious?
Ten minutes.

19:30.744 --> 19:33.513
He's been talking about
his family ever since.

19:33.581 --> 19:34.914
Biometrics are
over here.

19:34.983 --> 19:36.716
Cardiac, respiratory,
plus dermal infrared.

19:36.784 --> 19:38.285
Good. We'll know
if he's lying.

19:38.353 --> 19:40.287
Jack,

19:40.355 --> 19:42.155
the president is
monitoring this.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.657
Sergeant, I'm asking you,

19:44.725 --> 19:46.826
soldier to soldier,
let me have your firearm.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.997
I'll use one...
one bullet on myself.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.031
Please.

19:51.099 --> 19:52.432
Relax, Mr. Hodges.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.002
You're already dead.

19:58.006 --> 20:00.007
Sergeant.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.111
Who are you?

20:04.178 --> 20:05.645
My name is Jack Bauer.

20:05.713 --> 20:07.680
And right now,
I'm the only chance

20:07.748 --> 20:10.017
your wife and children
have to stay alive.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.052
Explain that to me.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.388
The people that wanted you dead
don't know you survived.

20:14.455 --> 20:15.455
Tell us who they are,

20:15.523 --> 20:17.324
and we'll keep
it that way.

20:17.392 --> 20:19.226
The President has agreed
to provide you with a death

20:19.293 --> 20:21.395
certificate and witness
protection in exchange

20:21.462 --> 20:23.397
for actionable information.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.032
I can't watch this anymore.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.400
If you refuse, it'll be released

20:26.467 --> 20:28.735
to the press that you are alive
and in our custody

20:28.802 --> 20:30.003
and that you're cooperating.

20:30.071 --> 20:32.139
We'll let your friends
take care of the rest.

20:32.206 --> 20:34.141
My family is innocent.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.709
The president would never
allow that to happen.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.379
She doesn't have
the stomach for it.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.448
You might be right
about that.

20:42.716 --> 20:44.684
But make no mistake
about it, sir.

20:44.752 --> 20:46.953
I do.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.057
Trust me.

20:50.124 --> 20:51.658
Do your family a favor.

20:51.725 --> 20:54.727
Just tell me who you've
been working with.

21:00.168 --> 21:02.102
I am--

21:02.170 --> 21:04.604
I was--

21:04.672 --> 21:06.940
part of a larger group
of like minds.

21:07.007 --> 21:09.276
You mean, other companies
like Starkwood.

21:09.343 --> 21:11.010
I mean people who can
protect this country

21:11.079 --> 21:12.546
better than any
government ever could.

21:12.613 --> 21:14.381
There are hundreds of private
military companies

21:14.449 --> 21:15.582
in this country, we're talking

21:15.649 --> 21:17.217
tens of thousands of people.

21:17.285 --> 21:18.585
But only a handful

21:18.652 --> 21:21.721
with the guts and the vision
to do what was necessary.

21:21.789 --> 21:22.889
And what is that?

21:22.957 --> 21:25.258
The plan was to launch
simultaneous attacks

21:25.326 --> 21:26.726
early next year.

21:26.794 --> 21:27.760
Multiple cities.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.262
So the public would finally see

21:29.330 --> 21:30.763
that the government
can't protect them.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.200
They'd demand drastic measures
and we'd step in.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.202
How would you justify that
to the American people?

21:35.269 --> 21:36.369
Simple.

21:36.437 --> 21:37.704
Offload the blame.

21:37.771 --> 21:39.139
We were going to supply
the enemies

21:39.207 --> 21:40.873
that want to destroy
this country.

21:40.941 --> 21:42.609
Muhammed this,
Achmed that.

21:42.676 --> 21:45.112
From sleeper cells the
apologists say don't even exist.

21:45.179 --> 21:46.113
You of all people

21:46.180 --> 21:47.614
should understand.

21:47.681 --> 21:48.982
Understand what?

21:49.049 --> 21:51.151
I watched the Senate
hearing yesterday,

21:51.219 --> 21:54.154
and I was disgusted
with how you were treated.

21:54.222 --> 21:56.156
You should be regarded
as a hero,

21:56.224 --> 21:58.992
not a criminal.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.961
I broke the law.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.930
You were
following

22:03.998 --> 22:07.066
your instinct to protect
your country, just like me.

22:07.135 --> 22:08.368
Mr. Hodges, I need the names

22:08.436 --> 22:10.069
of the people
that you are working with.

22:10.138 --> 22:12.439
I have spent my entire life
protecting this country

22:12.507 --> 22:14.674
from enemies large and small.

22:14.742 --> 22:16.709
I created Starkwood
from the ground up.

22:16.777 --> 22:18.645
And the government
used us to great effect.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.047
And now they think
they can just throw us away.

22:21.115 --> 22:22.982
Are you telling me
that this has been

22:23.050 --> 22:24.451
about protecting your
contracts, about money?

22:24.519 --> 22:27.587
I tried to tell the politicians
how vulnerable we are,

22:27.655 --> 22:29.055
and they wouldn't listen.

22:29.123 --> 22:30.624
So we decided
to show them.

22:30.691 --> 22:33.627
By attacking your own country
with a biological weapon?

22:33.694 --> 22:35.228
By killing
innocent people?

22:35.296 --> 22:38.064
Yes, a few innocent lives
would be lost,

22:38.132 --> 22:40.033
but only to save
the greater number.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.535
Having the courage
to make those hard choices

22:41.602 --> 22:43.002
gives us a lot in common,
Mr. Bauer.

22:43.070 --> 22:45.272
Let me explain something to you.

22:45.339 --> 22:48.708
You and I have absolutely
nothing in common.

22:48.776 --> 22:51.344
All that you have done today
is create a scenario

22:51.412 --> 22:52.646
by attacking your own country

22:52.713 --> 22:54.214
that has made you valuable
again.

22:54.282 --> 22:55.715
Today has been
nothing short

22:55.783 --> 22:57.350
of a desperate
grab for power,

22:57.418 --> 22:58.485
and it has failed.

22:58.553 --> 23:00.019
<i>You have failed,
and unless</i>

23:00.087 --> 23:01.188
you want me to go public

23:01.255 --> 23:02.455
with the fact that
you are still alive,

23:02.523 --> 23:03.756
you are gonna
give me the names

23:03.824 --> 23:05.225
of the people that
you've been working with.

23:05.293 --> 23:06.493
I-I don't have them.
I want the names.

23:06.561 --> 23:08.495
I don't have any.
I want the names!

23:08.563 --> 23:10.330
I don't know any!

23:11.732 --> 23:13.733
Fine.

23:23.043 --> 23:25.412
<i>Patch me through to Amy Meyer
at the Washington Post.</i>

23:25.479 --> 23:27.214
No.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.583
Amy, it's Jack. I have
a statement I need to make.

23:29.650 --> 23:30.817
Wait!

23:30.884 --> 23:32.985
Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait!
Give me the names!

23:33.053 --> 23:35.088
I swear... I swear
I don't have them.

23:35.155 --> 23:37.156
This whole project was...
was based on anonymity.

23:37.225 --> 23:38.558
We never met in person.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.660
Everything was handled through
an intermediary, a woman.

23:40.728 --> 23:42.028
She never told
me who she was.

23:42.096 --> 23:43.196
She never told
me her name.

23:43.264 --> 23:44.364
I never asked her.

23:44.432 --> 23:45.998
The same woman
that gave you the poison?

23:46.066 --> 23:48.101
Yes, yes.

23:58.312 --> 23:59.812
Amy, I'm sorry.
Something's come up.

23:59.880 --> 24:01.381
I've got to call you back.

24:03.618 --> 24:05.585
You tell yourself
whatever you want.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.354
You are a traitor.

24:07.421 --> 24:10.557
Witness Protection
was your promise.

24:10.625 --> 24:12.492
Yeah.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.696
Madam President,
did you hear everything

24:16.764 --> 24:18.164
that Hodges had to say?

24:18.232 --> 24:20.533
Yes. Is any of it even credible?

24:20.601 --> 24:22.369
All of it is.
Biometric monitors here indicate

24:22.436 --> 24:23.737
that he was telling the truth.

24:23.804 --> 24:25.305
Whoever they are,
this group just went

24:25.373 --> 24:26.673
through an awful
lot of trouble

24:26.741 --> 24:28.441
to get their hands
on that last canister.

24:28.509 --> 24:31.077
It seems very clear to me
that their plan is still on.

24:31.145 --> 24:32.712
You mean
another attack?
Yes, ma'am.

24:32.780 --> 24:34.514
I think you should proceed
under the assumption

24:34.582 --> 24:35.615
that they might
strike immediately.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.783
Hold on.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.217
Hodges said some
time next year.

24:38.286 --> 24:39.919
<i>No. Hodges said
that was the plan.</i>

24:39.987 --> 24:42.489
Given the chaos
that he created today,

24:42.556 --> 24:44.591
the smart strategic move
would be to act right now.

24:44.659 --> 24:46.726
Now, I believe the canister
is still in this area,

24:46.794 --> 24:48.227
so we're gonna have
to alert Homeland,

24:48.296 --> 24:49.729
have them start identifying
and raiding targets.

24:49.797 --> 24:51.030
Hodges said
that the plan was

24:51.098 --> 24:52.332
to enlist parties
with terrorist ties.

24:52.400 --> 24:54.967
At this point, I think that
might be our most solid lead.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.503
Madam President, I
agree with Agent Walker.

24:56.570 --> 24:58.237
We need to make
an immediate threat assessment

24:58.306 --> 25:00.674
with focus on all known
terrorist activity.

25:00.741 --> 25:02.642
The fastest way
for us to get that information

25:02.710 --> 25:04.644
is to gain access
to the CTU servers

25:04.712 --> 25:06.379
that have been sealed
as a result

25:06.447 --> 25:08.047
of Senator Mayer's
investigation.

25:08.115 --> 25:11.184
I'll have them
recommissioned immediately.

25:11.251 --> 25:13.119
And consider the resources
of this government

25:13.187 --> 25:15.188
at your disposal, Jack.

25:16.256 --> 25:17.256
Thank you, ma'am.

25:17.325 --> 25:18.658
I need those servers
right away.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.593
They're in DOJ evidence
lockers on the third floor.

25:20.661 --> 25:21.961
I'll have I.T.
break them out.

25:22.029 --> 25:23.330
Okay, good.

25:23.397 --> 25:24.798
We have a new shift
of analysts coming in,

25:24.865 --> 25:26.733
if you can tell them
what you're looking for.

25:26.801 --> 25:28.000
No, we don't
have time.

25:28.068 --> 25:29.669
We need someone
who already knows the protocols.

25:29.737 --> 25:30.837
I'll take care of it.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.505
Just get me
those servers.

25:50.558 --> 25:51.691
Who is it?

25:51.759 --> 25:53.827
Hey, it's me Jack.

25:53.894 --> 25:55.829
Jack, where the hell are you?

25:55.896 --> 25:57.364
The FBI headquarters.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.898
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

25:58.966 --> 26:00.166
No one will
tell me anything.

26:00.234 --> 26:02.201
Is it true about Bill?

26:05.072 --> 26:06.439
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

26:13.080 --> 26:15.014
What happened?

26:15.082 --> 26:17.684
He was killed during
the White House siege.

26:17.752 --> 26:19.753
Chloe, you should know,

26:19.820 --> 26:22.589
Bill sacrificed his life
to save the president.

26:22.656 --> 26:23.956
Listen to me.

26:24.024 --> 26:25.692
This threat is not over.

26:25.760 --> 26:26.959
We believe that there's going

26:27.027 --> 26:29.228
to be a biological attack
somewhere in the area.

26:29.296 --> 26:31.464
Soon. I need your help
to stop it.

26:31.532 --> 26:32.999
How?

26:33.066 --> 26:35.535
I need you
to reconstitute the CTU servers.

26:35.603 --> 26:37.236
They were seized
when the CTU was decommissioned.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.505
I don't have access to them.

26:38.572 --> 26:40.774
You will
by the time you get here.

26:40.841 --> 26:43.342
Who's doing this?

26:43.411 --> 26:44.911
We don't have all the players.

26:44.978 --> 26:48.548
I'll fill you in with as much
as I know when you get here.

26:48.616 --> 26:51.951
I'm sending a car
over to your hotel.

26:54.955 --> 26:56.923
Chloe?

27:00.360 --> 27:02.295
Send a car.

27:02.362 --> 27:04.363
Thank you.

27:36.497 --> 27:38.331
Morris, wake up.

27:38.398 --> 27:40.600
What? Are you speaking
to me again now?

27:40.668 --> 27:41.935
I have to go.

27:42.002 --> 27:43.402
I need you to take Prescott
and get out of the city.

27:43.471 --> 27:45.137
Why?
I just spoke
with Jack.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.139
There's going to
be another attack.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.641
This time, it's biological.

27:48.709 --> 27:51.077
Okay, then we'll all get out
of here together.

27:51.144 --> 27:53.179
I can't.
FBI needs me.

27:53.246 --> 27:55.748
But the last time
you worked for these people,

27:55.816 --> 27:57.149
they arrested you.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.651
I know.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.954
But I'm the only one that can
get the servers back online.

28:01.021 --> 28:03.356
Well, I'm not gonna
leave you here.

28:03.423 --> 28:07.494
Not with the possibility
of a biological attack.

28:13.968 --> 28:15.267
Please.

28:15.335 --> 28:18.070
I'm the only one
that can do this.

28:18.138 --> 28:19.806
And Jack needs me.

28:19.874 --> 28:23.342
And I just need for you
and Prescott to be safe.

28:23.410 --> 28:25.812
Okay?

28:25.880 --> 28:28.014
I'll see you
back at home.

28:28.081 --> 28:31.718
Just... be careful.

28:33.787 --> 28:35.788
I will.

29:13.869 --> 29:16.403
All right, before we
begin, everyone make sure

29:16.471 --> 29:18.072
you have your updated
briefing packets,

29:18.140 --> 29:20.908
and the latest
CDC abstract.

29:20.976 --> 29:22.509
Jack, whenever
you're ready.

29:22.577 --> 29:24.912
Thank you.

29:24.980 --> 29:28.783
I know many of you have lost
friends and colleagues today.

29:30.118 --> 29:31.418
I have, too.

29:31.486 --> 29:33.520
Unfortunately, the time to mourn
these brave men and women

29:33.588 --> 29:34.789
is going to have to wait.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.891
'Cause, as many of you
are already aware,

29:36.958 --> 29:39.293
we are facing the threat
of a terrorist event

29:39.360 --> 29:40.594
somewhere on the
Eastern seaboard.

29:40.662 --> 29:42.062
We don't have specific intel

29:42.130 --> 29:43.397
as to the time table
of this attack,

29:43.464 --> 29:45.166
but we do have
reason to believe that

29:45.233 --> 29:47.935
the people that are behind this
will want to strike immediately.

29:48.003 --> 29:49.103
Excuse me.

29:49.171 --> 29:50.337
Tim Moran, field ops.

29:50.405 --> 29:52.072
Who are the people behind this?

29:52.140 --> 29:54.474
Right now, we only have
two confirmed suspects.

29:55.710 --> 29:56.811
Tony Almeida

29:56.878 --> 29:58.545
and the woman
he's been working with.

29:58.613 --> 30:00.080
We're still trying
to identify her.

30:00.148 --> 30:02.817
The assumption is,
the two of them are
part of a broader

30:02.884 --> 30:04.751
conspiracy as outlined
in your briefing material.

30:04.820 --> 30:06.320
And the nature of the attack?

30:06.387 --> 30:07.922
All it says here is biological.

30:07.989 --> 30:10.590
The actual pathogen is a prion
variant, designed to attack

30:10.658 --> 30:12.793
the central nervous system
and ultimately destroy it.

30:12.861 --> 30:14.228
Do we know what the target is?

30:14.296 --> 30:16.063
No, not yet.
We're also unclear

30:16.131 --> 30:17.832
on the specifics
of the delivery device.

30:17.899 --> 30:18.933
Well, what leads do we have?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.201
Right now,

30:20.268 --> 30:22.303
we are solely working
off an operational theory

30:22.370 --> 30:24.071
that the people
that are behind this

30:24.139 --> 30:25.339
will need
to manufacture evidence

30:25.406 --> 30:27.374
in an effort to offload
the blame for this attack

30:27.442 --> 30:28.809
to either another group
or an individual

30:28.877 --> 30:29.977
with terrorist sympathies.

30:30.045 --> 30:31.312
During the ensuing panic,

30:31.379 --> 30:33.447
these people will move in
and seize power

30:33.514 --> 30:36.416
under the guise of creating
and maintaining stability.

30:36.484 --> 30:38.819
So, our job here is
to look for traces

30:38.887 --> 30:39.887
of that manufactured
evidence.

30:39.955 --> 30:41.255
How exactly?

30:41.323 --> 30:43.924
Pattern searches of suspicious
financial transactions.

30:43.992 --> 30:46.260
Keyword intercepts
of existing wiretaps,

30:46.328 --> 30:47.427
websites and e-mails.

30:47.495 --> 30:48.595
And data-mining all

30:48.663 --> 30:50.364
NSA and CIA intelligence

30:50.431 --> 30:51.866
on jihadist activities
over the past six months.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.167
Excuse me.

30:53.235 --> 30:56.570
Not only is that type
of blanket surveillance illegal.

30:56.637 --> 30:58.205
We don't have the capacity
to pull it off.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.373
The search algorithms

30:59.440 --> 31:01.508
simply
don't exist.
Yes, they do.

31:01.576 --> 31:03.244
At CTU.
Those servers
were decommissioned.

31:03.311 --> 31:04.444
Not anymore. They're here.

31:04.512 --> 31:06.446
We're in the process
of installing them now.

31:08.049 --> 31:10.384
Well, what does that make us,
CTU-lite?

31:10.451 --> 31:12.586
Last I heard,
the Bureau was

31:12.653 --> 31:15.256
a federal entity
bound by federal statute.

31:15.323 --> 31:17.258
Janis, do this or I will find
someone else who will.

31:17.325 --> 31:18.525
I do not have time to argue.

31:18.593 --> 31:20.027
I'm not arguing.
I'm asking.

31:20.095 --> 31:21.561
Moving on.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.869
I've got her
from here. Thanks.

31:28.937 --> 31:30.737
Jack.
Hey.

31:33.708 --> 31:35.675
Thanks for coming.

31:35.743 --> 31:36.843
You look like hell.

31:36.912 --> 31:38.412
Are you all right?
I'm fine.

31:38.479 --> 31:39.579
You don't look fine.

31:39.647 --> 31:40.747
Maybe a little tired.

31:40.815 --> 31:42.682
Did you get the report
I sent you?

31:42.750 --> 31:44.584
Yeah. I read it
on the way over.

31:44.652 --> 31:46.253
It's terrifying.
How real is this?
Real.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.755
We're getting access to
the CTU servers, right?

31:48.823 --> 31:50.057
Yeah. They're coming
online now.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.358
Shouldn't I be
supervising this?

31:51.426 --> 31:52.626
Yeah. Look,

31:52.693 --> 31:53.794
there's something I need

31:53.861 --> 31:55.595
to talk to you about
before we get started.

31:55.663 --> 31:58.598
There's no easy way
for me to say this.

31:58.666 --> 32:01.302
But Tony's been responsible
for these attacks.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.471
That's not possible.

32:04.539 --> 32:06.473
He was using you
and Bill all along.

32:06.541 --> 32:07.641
He's really been working

32:07.708 --> 32:09.443
for a group
of private military firms

32:09.510 --> 32:10.945
trying to destabilize
this country

32:11.012 --> 32:12.512
in an effort
to seize power.

32:12.580 --> 32:13.914
So far today,

32:13.982 --> 32:16.550
his actions have cost the lives
of hundreds of people.

32:16.617 --> 32:18.218
But he's threatening
thousands more.

32:18.286 --> 32:20.254
It doesn't make any sense.

32:20.322 --> 32:22.957
I know he was devastated
over Michelle, but...

32:23.024 --> 32:24.658
Chloe, he's not your friend.

32:24.725 --> 32:28.095
The Tony that you knew--
he doesn't exist anymore.

32:28.163 --> 32:29.663
There has to
be a reason.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.131
A reason for what?

32:31.199 --> 32:33.133
Bringing down
two passenger planes?

32:33.201 --> 32:35.802
Trying to ambush
25 federal agents?

32:35.870 --> 32:39.106
Chloe, he tried to kill me.

32:42.177 --> 32:44.744
He betrayed us all--
you, me,

32:44.812 --> 32:45.745
and Bill,

32:45.813 --> 32:48.115
and right now
our only responsibility

32:48.183 --> 32:49.249
is to stop him.

32:49.317 --> 32:51.452
Now, I need to know
that you can treat him

32:51.519 --> 32:54.355
as an enemy combatant,
that you are with me on this.

32:54.422 --> 32:57.491
Okay, I'll do
whatever you say.

32:57.558 --> 33:02.463
<i>No, I need to know
that you are with me on this.</i>

33:06.567 --> 33:08.502
I'm with you.

33:08.569 --> 33:09.936
Okay.

33:10.005 --> 33:12.006
Let's go.

33:23.851 --> 33:26.220
His name is Jibraan Al-Zarian.

33:26.287 --> 33:28.055
27 years old.

33:28.123 --> 33:30.991
He's a day laborer at
Cabrera Granite Construction.

33:31.059 --> 33:32.192
Immigration status?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.193
Illegal.

33:33.261 --> 33:35.595
His visa expired
as of January.

33:35.663 --> 33:37.197
Ties to any
extremist groups?

33:37.265 --> 33:40.067
No, none, but there's
definitely anger there.

33:40.135 --> 33:41.235
Both parents were killed

33:41.302 --> 33:42.403
in a U.S. air strike
by the Pakistani border.

33:42.470 --> 33:44.971
He was 11 at the time.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.474
Fits the psych profile.

33:47.542 --> 33:50.644
Bit of a loner,
a mystery to his coworkers,

33:50.711 --> 33:52.079
and we build the rest.

33:52.147 --> 33:53.880
What about the family?

33:53.948 --> 33:57.651
One younger brother, who he's
pretty much raised on his own.

33:57.718 --> 33:58.718
It's perfect, huh?

34:00.422 --> 34:01.555
Though it is doubtful

34:01.622 --> 34:03.390
that anyone sleeps very well
in D.C. tonight,

34:03.458 --> 34:07.194
a certain calm has now settled
over the streets of Capitol Hill

34:07.262 --> 34:09.629
after an unprecedented series
of terror attacks

34:09.697 --> 34:13.534
left people all over the country
shaken and demanding answers.

34:13.601 --> 34:15.835
In her speech, President Taylor
went a long way...

34:15.902 --> 34:16.835
Hey.

34:16.904 --> 34:17.837
Morning.

34:17.905 --> 34:19.839
Pour yourself
some orange juice.

34:22.342 --> 34:24.078
I'm not really very hungry.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.679
Sit down, eat
some breakfast for once.

34:26.746 --> 34:28.181
It's unhealthy not to.

34:28.248 --> 34:29.516
What are you doing up anyway?

34:29.583 --> 34:30.516
I, uh,

34:30.585 --> 34:32.719
couldn't sleep.

34:34.655 --> 34:37.591
Listen, uh, I want you to come
home straight after work today.

34:37.658 --> 34:39.426
Okay?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.395
No dillydallying.

34:41.463 --> 34:42.396
Why?

34:42.464 --> 34:44.598
Just in case.

34:44.665 --> 34:46.266
In case of what?

34:46.333 --> 34:49.136
These attacks,
this terrorism--

34:49.204 --> 34:50.304
it's all over the news.

34:52.039 --> 34:53.773
Okay, it's not a good day
to be a Muslim.

34:53.841 --> 34:56.876
Jibraan, Muslims had
nothing to do with it.

34:56.944 --> 34:58.745
Doesn't matter.

34:58.813 --> 35:01.181
Nobody cares, believe me.

35:01.249 --> 35:04.251
Most of the guys at my work
think I'm Puerto Rican anyway.

35:09.557 --> 35:11.024
It's about time.

35:38.086 --> 35:40.554
Come in.

35:40.621 --> 35:42.189
Excuse me, Ms. Taylor.

35:42.257 --> 35:43.490
What is it?

35:43.558 --> 35:46.160
The attorney general asked me
to check in with you.

35:46.228 --> 35:48.195
He is waiting
to sign off on a document

35:48.263 --> 35:50.831
I was told you were reviewing.

35:50.899 --> 35:52.233
Anyone happen to mention to you

35:52.300 --> 35:53.901
what this
document is about?

35:53.969 --> 35:54.902
No, ma'am.

35:54.970 --> 35:57.804
No, I imagine
they wouldn't.

35:57.873 --> 35:58.939
It's a secret,

35:59.007 --> 36:01.909
highly classified.

36:01.977 --> 36:04.044
Not that I give a damn.

36:04.112 --> 36:06.113
It's a get-out-
of-jail-free card

36:06.181 --> 36:08.448
for Jonas Hodges,

36:08.516 --> 36:12.486
the bastard responsible
for my brother's death

36:12.553 --> 36:14.221
and so many others.

36:14.289 --> 36:16.656
I don't understand, ma'am.

36:16.724 --> 36:19.526
Mr. Hodges died
in the hospital.

36:19.594 --> 36:23.130
I wish that were the case,
but no,

36:23.198 --> 36:25.699
and once the A.G. signs this
witness protection agreement,

36:25.767 --> 36:26.934
Hodges is going

36:27.002 --> 36:31.238
to live out his days in
comfort and anonymity

36:31.306 --> 36:35.175
while my brother lies in
his grave in Arlington Cemetery.

36:37.913 --> 36:39.914
Does that sound like justice
to you, Aaron?

36:39.981 --> 36:43.250
No, ma'am, it does not.

36:43.318 --> 36:45.085
And yet my mother saw fit

36:45.153 --> 36:47.788
to reward this monster
for his cooperation.

36:47.855 --> 36:50.557
Well, I'm sure it was
a difficult decision

36:50.625 --> 36:51.992
for the president
to make.

36:52.060 --> 36:53.294
Not difficult
enough.

36:53.361 --> 36:54.995
My mother may be
able to live with it,

36:55.063 --> 36:58.198
but I'm not
sure I can.

36:58.266 --> 37:03.170
Ms. Taylor, I have seen
the guilty walk free

37:03.238 --> 37:05.039
many times.

37:05.106 --> 37:07.074
I understand your anger
and frustration,

37:07.142 --> 37:10.010
and I am genuinely sorry.

37:13.548 --> 37:15.649
Um...

37:15.716 --> 37:19.286
tell the A.G. I've
reviewed the agreement

37:19.354 --> 37:21.255
and we can
move ahead.

37:21.323 --> 37:23.824
Thank you, ma'am.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.862
Is there anything else
that I can do for you?

37:28.930 --> 37:31.832
Other than kill
Jonas Hodges, no.

37:37.973 --> 37:40.307
I'm sorry, Aaron.

37:40.375 --> 37:41.575
I didn't mean that.

37:41.642 --> 37:43.344
I was just venting.

37:44.379 --> 37:46.746
Ma'am.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.548
Hello?

38:21.616 --> 38:22.549
Martin?

38:22.617 --> 38:23.783
It's Olivia Taylor.

38:23.851 --> 38:24.784
Did I wake you?

38:24.852 --> 38:27.221
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

38:27.288 --> 38:28.222
What time is it?

38:28.289 --> 38:29.656
Almost 4:00.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.458
Actually I didn't expect
to catch you at home.

38:31.526 --> 38:32.559
I thought you were
in Florida

38:32.627 --> 38:34.794
doing opposition
for the Gainor campaign.

38:34.862 --> 38:37.664
No, that didn't
really work out.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.066
Why not?

38:39.134 --> 38:41.768
Let's just say that my methods
were a little hardball

38:41.836 --> 38:43.970
for the governor's taste.

38:47.008 --> 38:50.010
So... what can I do
for you, Olivia?

38:50.078 --> 38:52.479
You heard about the attack
on the White House?

38:52.547 --> 38:55.382
Yeah, I watched your mother's
address to the nation.

38:55.450 --> 38:56.683
Really impressive.

38:56.751 --> 38:59.319
She continues to
surprise, doesn't she?

38:59.387 --> 39:00.887
Listen, Martin,
I need your help.

39:00.955 --> 39:02.122
Can we meet?

39:02.190 --> 39:03.857
Now?
Yeah.

39:03.925 --> 39:06.326
Well, what's this about,
Olivia?

39:06.394 --> 39:08.128
I can't talk about
it over the phone.

39:08.196 --> 39:09.996
Well, it's the middle
of the night, you know?

39:10.065 --> 39:12.066
Y-You got to do
better than that.

39:15.203 --> 39:17.871
We were in a dive hotel bar
in Atlanta

39:17.939 --> 39:19.005
right after we picked Hayworth

39:19.074 --> 39:20.941
to be the running mate
on the ticket.

39:21.008 --> 39:22.842
There was an issue
regarding his abuse

39:22.910 --> 39:25.079
of a certain prescription drug

39:25.146 --> 39:27.214
and a local reporter who
couldn't be persuaded

39:27.282 --> 39:28.582
to shut up about it.

39:28.649 --> 39:32.986
I remember
you turned to me and said

39:33.054 --> 39:34.020
there was no problem

39:34.089 --> 39:37.191
that couldn't be handled
or eliminated.

39:37.258 --> 39:39.793
Uh-huh.

39:39.860 --> 39:42.729
Well, I was drunk.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.431
You were serious.

39:44.499 --> 39:47.000
You know, you're right.

39:47.068 --> 39:49.035
We shouldn't be talking
about this over the phone.

39:49.104 --> 39:51.238
How soon can you be
at the White House?

39:51.306 --> 39:53.039
How's 15 minutes sound?

39:53.108 --> 39:55.109
Good.

40:00.848 --> 40:02.216
You done
with that yet?

40:02.283 --> 40:03.783
I'm not familiar
with these commands.

40:03.851 --> 40:07.154
Oh, you don't want to boot
the subnet with server two.

40:07.222 --> 40:08.888
It has a faulty bus that
we weren't able to fix

40:08.956 --> 40:10.023
before you guys
impounded it.

40:10.091 --> 40:11.825
Well, maybe you'd
like to take over.

40:11.892 --> 40:14.794
Only if you want it
to work right.

40:14.862 --> 40:17.797
I don't like this either.

40:17.865 --> 40:19.333
Is there a problem?
Yes, there is.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.001
I'm not comfortable
doing this.

40:21.068 --> 40:23.003
I agreed to it,
but I don't like it.

40:23.070 --> 40:24.971
What exactly aren't
you comfortable with?

40:25.039 --> 40:27.807
Uh, well, the Bill of Rights
being violated, for one,

40:27.875 --> 40:29.042
so if you're going
to be doing anything

40:29.110 --> 40:30.043
grossly illegal,
please...

40:30.111 --> 40:31.077
We'll make sure
we notify you

40:31.146 --> 40:32.846
so you can leave the building.

40:47.061 --> 40:48.862
Hello, Big Brother.

40:48.929 --> 40:50.830
Look, if you think your need

40:50.898 --> 40:53.300
to complain is more important
than the lives of the people

40:53.368 --> 40:55.669
that are counting on us,
go whine somewhere else!

40:55.736 --> 40:57.638
Jack, it's okay.
No, it is not okay!

40:57.705 --> 41:00.707
President David Palmer
recommissioned these servers

41:00.775 --> 41:02.976
because he felt it was
vital to national security!

41:03.044 --> 41:05.045
President Palmer
made the call!

41:05.112 --> 41:06.913
Is that going to be
good enough for you?!

41:06.981 --> 41:08.382
Answer me!

41:08.449 --> 41:09.449
Yes.

41:33.007 --> 41:35.942
There's something
really wrong with him.

41:36.010 --> 41:37.578
He said
President Palmer.

41:37.645 --> 41:39.279
He meant Taylor.

41:39.347 --> 41:41.415
He said it twice.

42:08.209 --> 42:10.944
What is this now?

42:11.011 --> 42:11.978
Probably a fuse.

42:12.046 --> 42:14.381
Here, you do
what you can

42:14.449 --> 42:16.950
to finish up.

42:17.017 --> 42:19.553
I'm gonna go
check the box.

42:35.169 --> 42:36.136
Jibraan!

42:36.203 --> 42:37.604
Hamid?

42:39.206 --> 42:40.206
Jibra...

42:41.041 --> 42:43.843
Hamid?

42:47.982 --> 42:49.683
Keep your mouth shut
and no one gets hurt.

42:49.751 --> 42:51.618
Who are you?
What do you want? Shut up!

42:51.686 --> 42:53.754
What did you do
to my brother?

42:53.821 --> 42:54.988
Hamid!
One more word,

42:55.055 --> 42:56.956
I put a bullet in your brain.

42:57.024 --> 42:57.957
Understand?

42:58.025 --> 42:59.859
You understand?!
Yes!
