00:03.440 --> 00:05.900
<i>Serara, the girl we saved in Susukino,</i>

00:06.280 --> 00:09.430
<i>belongs to Marielle's guild, 
the Crescent Moon Alliance.</i>

00:10.660 --> 00:14.650
<i>A guild is a team comprised of many players.</i>

00:16.120 --> 00:18.520
<i>Guilds offer many advantages that parties,</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:21.380
<i>which are more provisional, don't have.</i>

00:22.250 --> 00:25.070
<i>For example, a shared vault in the game's bank,</i>

00:25.070 --> 00:27.570
<i>and a dedicated communication system.</i>

00:27.570 --> 00:31.180
<i>And most important, potential use of a guild hall,</i>

00:31.180 --> 00:34.130
<i>located here, at the Guild Building.</i>

00:34.950 --> 00:40.140
<i>These halls can be purchased or rented, 
and are divided into several ranks.</i>

00:41.560 --> 00:45.150
<i>Normally, you select a hall 
based on your guild's size.</i>

00:45.870 --> 00:50.420
<i>The Crescent Moon Alliance uses what's known 
as a rank-B hall, consisting of seven rooms.</i>

00:51.050 --> 00:57.040
<b>Welcome home, Serara!</b>

00:51.480 --> 00:55.160
<i>For them, the size is exactly right.</i>

02:29.070 --> 02:33.150
Making the food without using 
commands is more difficult,

02:33.150 --> 02:35.150
but it's worth it.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.550
This smell... This perfectly charred color...

02:38.550 --> 02:40.180
I remember this!

02:40.180 --> 02:42.410
It's food!

02:42.410 --> 02:45.170
You're going to make it too salty.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.310
I still can't do it!

02:48.310 --> 02:53.020
To make difficult foods, 
you need a high cooking skill.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.650
And even if two people with the same 
level use the same ingredients,

02:57.650 --> 03:00.030
their dishes can still taste different.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.390
It's no different than in our old world.

03:04.300 --> 03:06.250
Serara's working hard.

03:06.250 --> 03:09.790
Even though this party is for her...

03:09.870 --> 03:15.800
<b>Resolve</b>

03:13.460 --> 03:14.460
Resolve.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.460
Listen, kid.

03:19.460 --> 03:23.610
Your level isn't what's important. 
It's what comes after that.

03:23.610 --> 03:25.080
What comes after my level?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.520
Secret techniques?!

03:26.520 --> 03:29.480
I mean panties.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.350
Pa—

03:30.350 --> 03:32.480
What are you talking about?

03:32.740 --> 03:34.770
Nothing much, just p—

03:34.770 --> 03:37.320
Powerful monsters! About powerful monsters...

03:38.110 --> 03:39.180
Marielle?

03:39.600 --> 03:40.680
Coming!

03:43.370 --> 03:44.680
Don't tell anyone?

03:44.680 --> 03:48.240
We shouldn't let our rivals learn 
about this food for a while.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.170
Why? It's a big deal!

03:51.170 --> 03:52.750
It's too big a deal.

03:53.270 --> 03:57.000
If people suddenly find out, 
it could cause problems.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.670
That's what Shiroe said.

03:59.140 --> 04:01.950
Thank you for your help.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.490
I-It was nothing...

04:03.490 --> 04:05.210
Everyone's grateful!

04:05.210 --> 04:06.900
Let's have a toast!

04:12.310 --> 04:13.910
I'm so happy!

04:13.910 --> 04:16.180
Not just Ashlin, but Akatsuki, too!

04:16.180 --> 04:18.060
Wh-What are you going to do?

04:18.060 --> 04:19.100
Ashlin...

04:19.100 --> 04:20.380
Right!

04:20.380 --> 04:23.910
Today, we have three types 
of summer dress for you.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.510
I am my lord's personal ninja!

04:26.510 --> 04:28.370
I couldn't wear such frivolous things!

04:28.680 --> 04:31.370
Shiroe's given his permission.

04:31.650 --> 04:33.810
Now, just give up...

04:33.810 --> 04:37.250
Y-You sold me out, my lord!

04:37.250 --> 04:39.820
You sold me out!

04:47.340 --> 04:49.970
Marie, I...

04:54.090 --> 04:56.260
We'll have a lot of cleaning tomorrow.

04:56.870 --> 04:58.560
Are you going to sleep, too?

04:58.560 --> 04:59.730
I'm not that tired.

04:59.980 --> 05:02.390
Then shall I make some tea?

05:04.670 --> 05:06.870
You really helped us this time.

05:07.190 --> 05:08.460
Thank you.

05:08.460 --> 05:10.010
It's fine, really.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.790
I didn't do anything too big.

05:12.790 --> 05:17.630
If it wasn't big, then what would be?

05:17.630 --> 05:19.920
While I was away, what's happened here?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.340
Here? You mean in Akihabara?

05:24.600 --> 05:27.590
I think it's better than it was.

05:28.100 --> 05:31.850
There is far less PKing, and it's a little safer.

05:32.330 --> 05:33.100
But...

05:33.630 --> 05:37.610
I couldn't say exactly why, but there's 
something unpleasant in the air.

05:38.390 --> 05:42.990
It's like, well... Like everyone 
has fallen into ranks.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.110
Ranks?

05:44.700 --> 05:48.400
We're a small guild, with fewer 
than thirty members, right?

05:48.400 --> 05:52.370
We have four level 90s, 
while most are under 50.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.710
But the biggest guilds...

05:55.240 --> 05:59.380
For example, have you heard 
of D.D.D., Crusty's guild?

06:00.340 --> 06:04.050
The raid guild that beat Oracle's Tower, right?

06:04.700 --> 06:09.040
The Legion Raid that they said the 
Japanese couldn't have beaten...

06:09.570 --> 06:10.510
Yeah.

06:11.220 --> 06:15.140
A raid like that can have hundred-player fights.

06:15.900 --> 06:20.910
Supposedly, they have over 1,500 members, 
including plenty of level 90s.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.020
Then, by "rank," you meant the guilds?

06:23.350 --> 06:24.710
It feels as though

06:24.710 --> 06:28.680
the bigger guilds are determining 
the town's feel and its rules.

06:29.220 --> 06:32.310
For example, who has priority using the market.

06:32.310 --> 06:33.540
I had no idea.

06:34.370 --> 06:36.040
It's the same way with the hunting grounds.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.210
Since the strong and weak guilds were divided,

06:39.210 --> 06:43.270
the weak guilds will no longer approach 
the stronger guilds' territories.

06:44.070 --> 06:49.300
Then the larger guilds have 
taken all the good hunting spots?

06:49.770 --> 06:52.680
You can't fight in the town, of course.

06:53.220 --> 06:57.520
But that doesn't mean you can 
clash in the hunting areas.

06:57.520 --> 07:03.500
Well, it means there's less PKing, which is good.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.030
But that's still...

07:05.370 --> 07:08.100
Somehow, I don't like it...

07:08.100 --> 07:10.280
I understand what you mean.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.210
It isn't just the hunting grounds.

07:12.940 --> 07:16.290
Invisible barriers are being erected everywhere.

07:16.780 --> 07:20.690
I think that's what they mean 
by the guilds falling into ranks.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.980
No one's to blame.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.550
And I'm sure the large guilds 
have their own problems.

07:28.210 --> 07:31.520
No laws or ethics prohibit people from 
using whatever strategy they can

07:31.520 --> 07:34.350
to give themselves an edge in this world.

07:35.970 --> 07:37.100
But still...

07:38.550 --> 07:40.480
It isn't a good thing.

07:44.150 --> 07:46.980
Though perhaps it's a matter of preference.

07:47.560 --> 07:48.490
That's true.

07:50.130 --> 07:51.740
A few days ago...

07:53.530 --> 07:57.380
But even if we try to oppose the bigger guilds...

07:57.380 --> 08:00.830
That's why we're trying to think of a way.

08:01.160 --> 08:04.750
For example, we could share the 
hunting grounds among ourselves.

08:05.470 --> 08:08.130
...many small guilds that know each other well

08:08.130 --> 08:11.510
discussed the possibility of 
creating a joint council.

08:13.170 --> 08:17.060
But each of the small guilds has its own opinions.

08:17.590 --> 08:22.060
We ended up quarreling over minor 
differences of opinion and selfish requests...

08:22.690 --> 08:24.060
W-Wait...

08:24.490 --> 08:28.230
Why don't we talk about this a bit more?

08:28.230 --> 08:30.540
It's a waste of time.

08:30.540 --> 08:32.050
Bye!

08:33.040 --> 08:34.740
I'm sorry.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.310
I wanted to help, but...

08:37.310 --> 08:40.450
I knew this wouldn't work.

08:42.160 --> 08:43.250
Further,

08:43.640 --> 08:47.990
the Black Sword Knights and the 
Silver Sword are aiming for 91.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.260
91?

08:49.850 --> 08:54.380
The old level cap was 90, 
but with the expansion...

08:54.380 --> 08:55.260
Yeah.

08:56.070 --> 09:01.270
With The Novasphere Pioneers expansion, 
the level cap was raised to 100,

09:01.630 --> 09:02.530
wasn't it?

09:03.330 --> 09:08.160
And since no new players have 
entered since the Apocalypse...

09:08.160 --> 09:10.020
Oh, I see...

09:10.020 --> 09:13.320
Because of the limit on how 
many you can allow to join...

09:13.320 --> 09:17.280
The Black Sword Knights have always 
had a thing about being the best.

09:17.780 --> 09:22.290
Their guild master, Isaac, is proud... 
Or maybe just enjoys excluding others...

09:22.290 --> 09:26.170
He won't allow anyone below 85 to join.

09:27.940 --> 09:33.820
So he isn't in the position D.D.D. was, 
where he can just start absorbing

09:33.820 --> 09:35.940
a bunch of smaller guilds.

09:35.940 --> 09:39.780
He's trying to fight quantity with quality, then?

09:39.780 --> 09:40.630
But...

09:40.630 --> 09:45.270
At a bare minimum, they'd need 
to hunt for level-85 monsters.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.270
But this isn't the same as the game...

09:48.680 --> 09:51.520
Isn't that pretty dangerous?

09:51.520 --> 09:54.190
It would be if they did it the normal way.

09:57.070 --> 09:59.450
They're using EXP pots.

09:59.870 --> 10:02.040
EXP pots?

10:02.350 --> 10:06.540
Do you mean they're leveling up by cheating?

10:08.240 --> 10:09.960
<i>EXP pots...</i>

10:10.630 --> 10:14.960
<i>Items that slightly increase attack 
power and health regeneration.</i>

10:15.610 --> 10:20.390
<i>And they double experience earned from combat.</i>

10:18.100 --> 10:18.650
<b>Death</b>

10:22.190 --> 10:24.450
<i>One of these potions</i>

10:24.450 --> 10:29.350
<i>was freely distributed to every 
player below level 30 once a day,</i>

10:29.350 --> 10:35.050
<i>so new players could level up and 
start enjoying the game more quickly.</i>

10:36.380 --> 10:38.880
After the Apocalypse,

10:38.880 --> 10:44.410
a guild called Hamelin gathered new players, 
claiming they wanted to help them.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.290
But they're selling their EXP pots

10:48.290 --> 10:51.920
to large guilds that want to raise their levels.

10:59.430 --> 11:01.810
<i>It's all starting to go wrong.</i>

11:02.400 --> 11:05.400
<i>This town... This world...</i>

11:06.730 --> 11:08.060
<i>Who's at fault?</i>

11:09.230 --> 11:13.220
<i>No, to a greater or lesser degree, everyone is.</i>

11:14.390 --> 11:16.620
<i>Including me, since I'm not doing anything.</i>

11:19.020 --> 11:20.070
<i>That's right...</i>

11:20.770 --> 11:22.570
<i>I only went to Susukino</i>

11:22.990 --> 11:26.880
<i>to vent some of my frustration 
at the way things are going.</i>

11:27.820 --> 11:29.800
<i>Thinking again?</i>

11:31.090 --> 11:33.080
<i>There's nothing wrong with thinking.</i>

11:33.920 --> 11:39.290
<i>But you're smart enough, so why 
not just solve the problem?</i>

11:43.380 --> 11:45.770
<i>But what can I do?</i>

11:46.340 --> 11:48.670
<i>I don't even have a guild...</i>

11:50.900 --> 11:53.100
<i>I don't have a guild...</i>

11:53.700 --> 11:54.610
<i>is it?</i>

11:54.980 --> 11:57.570
<b>Tohya

11:56.970 --> 12:00.700
That's just an excuse to run away...

12:05.230 --> 12:06.680
Can't sleep?

12:07.450 --> 12:08.330
No.

12:08.330 --> 12:10.910
Yeah, I'm too tired to sleep...

12:12.320 --> 12:16.100
Your brother helped me out yesterday.

12:16.990 --> 12:18.340
Tohya did?

12:18.340 --> 12:20.400
He's a good guy.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.040
Kind, cheerful, and hard-working.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.720
He's just empty-headed.

12:26.370 --> 12:29.070
You two seem to really get along.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.850
When this world was still a game,

12:32.340 --> 12:34.980
you two would form a party and 
adventure together, right?

12:35.780 --> 12:36.860
Yeah.

12:37.630 --> 12:38.930
Tohya...

12:39.570 --> 12:41.940
Tohya wanted to play.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.370
<i>All the old guilds that invited me</i>

12:46.800 --> 12:50.700
<i>just wanted to take advantage of 
my status as a veteran player.</i>

12:52.060 --> 12:53.950
<i>I hated it, and that's why...</i>

12:54.590 --> 12:55.880
<i>No, that isn't it.</i>

12:56.640 --> 13:00.480
<i>It wasn't all bad, having people rely on me.</i>

13:01.080 --> 13:04.690
I wish our guild master had 
a better grasp of things.

13:04.690 --> 13:07.510
Our guild's done for...

13:08.590 --> 13:11.040
<i>But when a lot of people get together,</i>

13:11.040 --> 13:14.520
<i>lip service isn't enough to get 
by anymore. And I hated that.</i>

13:15.940 --> 13:17.020
<i>No...</i>

13:17.660 --> 13:20.320
<i>I knew all that going in...</i>

13:22.780 --> 13:25.610
A guild... A guild?

13:25.610 --> 13:29.280
Do you still not like guilds, Shiroe?

13:30.740 --> 13:31.790
Chief...

13:32.450 --> 13:33.440
Meow.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.270
To be honest, I don't really know anymore.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.210
The more I think about why I didn't like guilds,

13:43.210 --> 13:46.460
the more haughty and childish I seem.

13:47.260 --> 13:52.340
It's true that the system itself 
makes it easy for guilds to go rotten.

13:52.340 --> 13:57.540
So I can understand why you'd want 
to keep your distance from that.

13:58.770 --> 14:04.520
But if there were a thing that never went 
bad, I don't know that I'd trust it.

14:05.470 --> 14:10.380
Any kind of life can go wrong, or sicken, or suffer.

14:10.380 --> 14:13.510
Lives get old, decay, and finally die.

14:14.200 --> 14:20.090
Disliking that fact because it hurts isn't 
any different than disliking life itself.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.310
I know you realize this.

14:24.310 --> 14:26.240
For example, our old place,

14:26.240 --> 14:29.930
the Tea Party, was a wonderful place...

14:30.590 --> 14:36.060
But the reason was because everyone 
worked to make it that way.

14:36.970 --> 14:42.230
Any treasure you attain without anyone 
ever working is no treasure at all.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.360
<i>He's right.</i>

14:47.350 --> 14:49.860
<i>The Tea Party and the Crescent Moon Alliance...</i>

14:51.040 --> 14:54.120
<i>In both, there was someone hard 
at work behind the scenes...</i>

14:55.660 --> 14:59.500
Chief, what should I do?

14:59.500 --> 15:02.550
The most amazing thing that you can.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.850
Amazing?

15:04.850 --> 15:07.550
You hold back too often.

15:08.850 --> 15:12.860
I don't think you need to feel 
so bound by duty all the time.

15:13.730 --> 15:16.110
I mean, there's no need to hold back!

15:17.810 --> 15:20.700
I've kept you waiting?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.200
That's right.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.910
Both of you were waiting for me?

15:25.480 --> 15:26.940
That's right.

15:27.810 --> 15:32.350
Instead of going elsewhere, 
you stayed with me.

15:32.870 --> 15:34.310
That's right.

15:44.370 --> 15:46.210
<i>Oh, a message...</i>

15:47.710 --> 15:53.470
<b>Shiroe</b>

15:48.450 --> 15:50.630
Um, hello.

15:50.630 --> 15:51.750
Do you remember me?

15:52.310 --> 15:53.470
It's Shiroe.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.490
This is Minori, right?

15:58.820 --> 15:59.970
Yes.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.480
Listen carefully, Minori...

16:04.260 --> 16:06.680
Cough softly once for yes.

16:07.170 --> 16:08.530
Twice for no.

16:09.090 --> 16:11.820
Three times if you want to say something.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.820
Got it?

16:13.820 --> 16:19.290
<i>Shiroe knows what's happening to us now...</i>

16:19.290 --> 16:21.620
Cough once if you understand.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.360
You're both in Hamelin, right?

16:30.120 --> 16:33.420
And you're giving your EXP pots to Hamelin?

16:36.690 --> 16:37.630
Are you okay?

16:41.590 --> 16:42.950
Are you okay?

16:47.760 --> 16:48.990
Really?

16:55.870 --> 16:57.410
You want to say something?

17:00.300 --> 17:03.670
I did tell you to cough three times 
if you had something to say.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.630
All right, I'll hurry, so I can hear it.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.680
For now, I'll believe you're okay.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.290
So believe in me, too, all right?

17:14.820 --> 17:16.550
I'll come to rescue you.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.780
Got it?

17:29.180 --> 17:31.500
Hey! Shiro!

17:31.500 --> 17:33.770
My lord, don't worry me.

17:33.770 --> 17:35.790
If you're leaving, say something.

17:35.790 --> 17:37.160
That's right.

17:37.160 --> 17:38.510
What...

17:41.670 --> 17:42.650
<i>That's right.</i>

17:43.250 --> 17:45.170
<i>Those two have been waiting</i>

17:46.820 --> 17:48.340
<i>for my words.</i>

17:53.090 --> 17:57.720
This time, I'd like your help with something.

17:58.020 --> 17:59.680
Our help?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.430
Anything you need, Shiroe!

18:02.950 --> 18:04.990
That's right.

18:04.990 --> 18:08.210
The Crescent Moon Alliance owes you much.

18:08.210 --> 18:09.110
Well?

18:09.610 --> 18:13.300
Some twins I know are being held captive...

18:13.300 --> 18:16.110
Or rather, being forced to stay in a nasty guild.

18:17.010 --> 18:20.120
I'd like to save them.

18:20.430 --> 18:21.830
I see...

18:21.830 --> 18:24.700
So you just need them to quit the guild, right?

18:24.700 --> 18:26.850
We could draw them off...

18:26.850 --> 18:27.670
Um...

18:28.390 --> 18:30.420
This guild you're talking about...

18:30.420 --> 18:36.840
This guild supposedly gathers new 
players and takes their EXP pots.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.070
Hamelin...

18:40.080 --> 18:44.020
I think it's time they left.

18:47.510 --> 18:49.830
W-Wait a second...

18:49.830 --> 18:51.900
Do you mean you'll destroy them?

18:52.560 --> 18:55.440
No, I mean exactly what I said.

18:56.160 --> 18:59.450
I'm going to have them leave Akihabara.

19:01.480 --> 19:05.130
Shiro, I understand how you feel...

19:05.130 --> 19:06.350
But we...

19:06.350 --> 19:09.010
I'm sorry, but please let me finish.

19:09.460 --> 19:11.460
This is only the first part.

19:12.570 --> 19:15.800
Hamelin's just a small portion of this.

19:18.330 --> 19:23.400
To be honest, I don't really like the 
way Akihabara feels right now.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.840
It's petty, pathetic, and cheap.

19:27.290 --> 19:28.060
That's why

19:28.990 --> 19:31.020
I'm going to clean the place up.

19:32.860 --> 19:35.470
Akihabara is our hometown.

19:35.470 --> 19:37.860
It's the largest city on the Japanese server.

19:38.570 --> 19:43.160
And it's sad, unpleasant, frail...

19:43.720 --> 19:46.410
Everyone walks with their heads down...

19:47.000 --> 19:52.420
It's as if our only purpose in 
life were to be pathetic.

19:54.370 --> 19:56.490
We number thirty thousand.

19:56.490 --> 19:58.920
But that also means there are 
only thirty thousand of us.

20:00.810 --> 20:05.430
I think everyone's been underestimating 
this world far too much.

20:06.840 --> 20:08.930
We aren't nearly desperate enough.

20:13.150 --> 20:14.390
I...

20:17.110 --> 20:18.940
Please help me.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.410
Shiro...

20:22.120 --> 20:23.310
Guild master...

20:24.190 --> 20:26.500
Could we at least hear him out?

20:27.290 --> 20:31.750
For a long time, I've been feeling the same way.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.490
Shouryuu...

20:34.490 --> 20:35.890
How would you do it?

20:35.890 --> 20:37.460
It depends on your plan.

20:37.460 --> 20:38.760
Tell us.

20:39.410 --> 20:43.160
And we'll decide if it's something 
we can help you with.

20:46.220 --> 20:47.980
I need money.

20:48.490 --> 20:49.770
For now,

20:50.620 --> 20:52.240
five million gold.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.770
F-Five million...

20:56.080 --> 20:57.770
M-Money?

20:58.150 --> 20:59.410
That's insane!

20:59.410 --> 21:01.150
Our treasury only has sixty thousand.

21:01.150 --> 21:03.510
Even if we included all our members' belongings...

21:03.510 --> 21:06.160
What would you use all that money for?

21:07.480 --> 21:10.040
The money isn't that important.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.310
It's only the start.

21:12.920 --> 21:15.630
The real problem comes after.

21:16.350 --> 21:19.630
I need everyone's hope and goodwill.

21:20.880 --> 21:25.090
I believe that more people 
like this town than hate it.

21:26.140 --> 21:30.640
The more people who want to 
save it, the more likely it is

21:31.410 --> 21:33.640
that we can win.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.150
So I'll say it again.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.380
Lend your assistance to me.

21:38.740 --> 21:41.280
To me... And to my guild.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.780
Shiro, did you just say "guild"?

21:47.780 --> 21:49.580
"My guild"?

21:50.610 --> 21:51.580
Yes.

21:52.050 --> 21:53.700
Then you made one?

21:53.700 --> 21:54.800
Yes.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.270
I'm sorry, since you've invited me.

21:57.270 --> 22:00.340
No, it's nothing to apologize for...

22:00.820 --> 22:02.130
I see.

22:02.130 --> 22:04.870
Congratulations, Shiro.

22:05.490 --> 22:07.570
So you managed to make one...

22:07.570 --> 22:11.350
You made a home...

22:13.390 --> 22:15.500
What's it called, Shiroe?

22:16.600 --> 22:17.980
What's the guild's name?

22:18.490 --> 22:20.480
Ah, right...

22:22.110 --> 22:23.490
Its name is...

22:28.480 --> 22:32.780
Log Horizon.

24:05.850 --> 24:07.820
Fragrant scents are in the air...

24:07.820 --> 24:11.160
Juicy meat... Crisp, fresh lettuce.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.980
And tomato with a touch of sourness.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.780
The sweetness of lightly toasted 
bread and smooth butter.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.850
Topped off with spicy mustard.

24:17.850 --> 24:19.990
This is called the Crescent Burger.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.940
On sale today, for just 50 gold.

24:22.940 --> 24:25.140
Next time: Crescent Moon.

24:22.940 --> 24:29.990
<b>Crescent Moon</b>

24:25.140 --> 24:27.130
This is our reality.
