00:02.003 --> 00:03.288
Previously on Lost:

00:06.883 --> 00:08.339
Son of a bitch.

00:30.448 --> 00:32.814
We're gonna get you
to the hospital. Mr. Locke?

00:33.326 --> 00:34.315
Mr. Locke?

00:34.410 --> 00:36.275
You found what they were hiding
in the submarine?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.031
| most certainly did.

00:47.882 --> 00:50.214
- Hello, Hugo.
- We have to talk to you.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.924
_ "We?"
- OK, guys.

00:53.471 --> 00:54.460
Come on out.

01:08.611 --> 01:09.691
Hello, Jack.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.198
l was hoping you'd come.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.988
I think we have some catching up to do.

01:32.301 --> 01:35.338
Hurley... this was your idea.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.971
You all right with me
talking with him alone?

01:42.019 --> 01:43.304
It's all you, dude.

01:45.564 --> 01:47.100
All right, let's catch up.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.869
You look just like him.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.705
Does it bother you?

02:08.796 --> 02:12.414
No, what bothers me is I don't
have any idea what the hell you are.

02:13.718 --> 02:14.958
Sure you do.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.473
Why John Locke?

02:23.894 --> 02:27.386
Because he was stupid enough to believe
he'd been brought here for a reason.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.724
Because he pursued that belief
until it got him killed,

02:32.320 --> 02:35.153
and because you were kind enough
to bring his body back here

02:35.239 --> 02:36.570
in a nice wooden box.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.653
He had to be dead before
you could look like him.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.075
That's right.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.830
Who else have you looked like?

02:48.502 --> 02:50.754
Jack, what do you really want to ask me?

02:53.007 --> 02:54.872
The third day we were here, I saw...

02:56.844 --> 02:59.961
I chased my father through the jungle.
My... my dead father.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.594
Was that you?

03:06.270 --> 03:07.806
Yes, that was me.

03:13.069 --> 03:16.436
- Why?
- You needed to find water.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.448
This may be hard
for you to believe, Jack,

03:21.535 --> 03:24.993
but all I've ever been
interested in is helping you.

03:25.081 --> 03:26.537
To help me?

03:28.167 --> 03:29.532
To do what?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.454
Leave.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.036
But because Jacob chose you,

03:34.131 --> 03:37.089
you were trapped on this island
before you even got here.

03:41.180 --> 03:44.638
But now Jacob's dead.
We don't have to be trapped anymore.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.888
We can get on an airplane
and fly away anytime we want to.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.892
If we can just fly away whenever
we want, why are you still here?

03:53.859 --> 03:56.692
Because it has to be all of us.

04:02.535 --> 04:03.570
What?

04:05.830 --> 04:09.243
John Locke was the only one of us
that ever believed in this place.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.915
He did everything he could
to keep us from leaving this island.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.493
John Locke was not a believer, Jack.

04:16.674 --> 04:18.164
He was a sucker.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.716
Sinus tach at 130, BP dropping.

04:24.807 --> 04:28.766
Last read was 62 over 30,
possibly due to internal bleeding.

04:28.853 --> 04:32.266
- Any signs of neurological damage?
- No response in lower reflexes.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.813
- That's because he's a paraplegic.
- You know this man?

04:34.900 --> 04:38.267
Yes. He's a substitute teacher
at my school. His name is Locke.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.729
Mr. Locke. I don't know his first name.
But he uses a wheelchair. Where is it?

04:41.824 --> 04:44.110
Smashed to pieces, that thing
probably saved his life.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.568
I saw the man that did this, the
hit-and-run driver was at our school.

04:47.663 --> 04:49.654
When we get to the hospital,
you can talk to the cops.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.579
Do you know anyone
we can contact for him?

04:51.667 --> 04:53.658
l have no idea.
Like I said, I barely know him.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.663
- Helen.
- What did you say?

04:56.839 --> 04:58.795
Helen Norwood.

04:59.717 --> 05:02.208
l was... gonna marry her.

05:04.180 --> 05:08.139
Well... You're still gonna marry her
'cause you're gonna be OK, Mr. Locke.

05:08.225 --> 05:09.635
John.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.555
My name is John.

05:14.231 --> 05:17.439
Blunt force trauma victim,
late 40s male, he needs a CT scan.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.814
We got a gunshot wound here. Female.
Entry wound, upper right quadrant.

05:20.905 --> 05:22.736
- Baby!
- Yes, I understand, she's pregnant.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.906
We're gonna take good care of her.
500 lost CC's. External blood loss.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.984
- Baby!
- We're gonna do everything we can.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.430
What is it?

05:54.563 --> 05:55.552
You can come out.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.400
You following us, Claire?

06:06.367 --> 06:09.029
- Yeah.
- Why?

06:10.204 --> 06:11.694
'Cause he's my brother.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.003
Looks like you two have a lot of
catching up to do. I'll leave you to it.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.550
Claire, l'm... I'm so sorry...

06:30.641 --> 06:35.305
Did he tell you? That he was the one
pretending to be our father?

06:37.231 --> 06:39.347
Yeah. Yeah, he told me.

06:42.653 --> 06:46.771
You know, I pretty much gave up
hoping that you'd ever come back.

06:46.865 --> 06:48.196
Now that you're here...

06:52.746 --> 06:54.407
It's good to see you, Jack.

06:56.292 --> 06:57.828
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.415
You know, I never really had much
in the way of family, so it...

07:02.506 --> 07:04.371
...means a lot
that you're coming with us.

07:08.846 --> 07:12.338
Actually, I haven't decided
if I'm coming with you.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.092
Yeah, you have.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.554
What do you mean?

07:19.648 --> 07:22.025
You decided the moment
you let him talk to you,

07:22.109 --> 07:23.269
just like the rest of us.

07:24.862 --> 07:29.856
So, you know, whether you like it
or not, you're with him now.

07:51.930 --> 07:55.058
- He's got a submarine?
- Keep your voice down, damn it.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.805
Yeah, Widmore's got a sub.
We'll use it to get off this rock.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.017
Are we gonna tell Sun?

08:02.691 --> 08:03.897
Kate's telling her now.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.225
I thought we might want
to avoid huddles.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.901
What about Sayid?

08:09.073 --> 08:12.031
Sayid ain't invited.
He's gone over to the dark side.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.067
But you can always bring
people back from the dark side.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.744
- I mean, Anakin...
- Who the hell's Anakin?

08:17.831 --> 08:21.289
Look, just keep your mouth shut.
Don't say nothin' to no one.

08:21.377 --> 08:22.742
Hey.

08:24.088 --> 08:27.080
- Hey, Claire.
- Hey, Hurley.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.874
You look great.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.433
It's so nice to have everyone
back together again.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.076
Want an apple?

09:03.001 --> 09:05.208
Hey, Schaub, I'm the one
who brought her in.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.956
Wanna give us a minute?

09:17.975 --> 09:19.465
Katherine Anne Austen.

09:20.269 --> 09:23.261
Wanted for arson,
assault on a federal officer,

09:24.064 --> 09:25.645
murder in the first degree.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.064
Funny. You don't strike me
as the murdering kind.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.817
That's because I'm not.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.116
You be sure and mention that
to the Feds when they get here.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.156
There something you wanted?

09:43.625 --> 09:46.412
You remember me? From the airport?

09:47.171 --> 09:48.661
We were on the same flight from Sydney.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.417
Yeah, I remember.

09:53.761 --> 09:57.754
Well, don't you think it's weird,
you and me being on the same flight,

09:57.848 --> 09:59.588
having that meet-up in the elevator?

09:59.683 --> 10:01.594
And a week later...

10:01.685 --> 10:04.176
Of all the cars in Los Angeles,
you smash into mine.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.351
Almost like someone's trying
to put us together.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.273
Are you hitting on me?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.739
lt'd never work.
I'm a cop. You're a murderer...

10:14.823 --> 10:18.361
- I already told you I'm not a murderer.
- Yeah, well, I'm still a cop.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.447
So why didn't you arrest me?

10:23.373 --> 10:27.537
- I did arrest you.
- No, in LAX, the elevator.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.751
You saw I was wearing handcuffs.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.625
I didn't see any handcuffs.

10:34.218 --> 10:38.211
All I saw was a pretty lady who needed
the door held open for her.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.761
You know what I think?

10:40.474 --> 10:43.466
I think you let me go
because you went to Australia,

10:43.560 --> 10:45.676
and you didn't want anyone
to know you were there.

10:49.942 --> 10:51.978
Should I tell that to the Feds
when they get here?

10:58.909 --> 11:00.570
I like you.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.868
Jim. Got a live one. Come on.

11:04.248 --> 11:06.660
Sorry. Duty calls.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.786
We caught a multiple homicide
at a restaurant.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.623
Victims were a lowlife named Keamy
and three goons on his payroll.

11:15.717 --> 11:19.335
Korean female GSW at the scene,
and her boyfriend witnessed it,

11:19.429 --> 11:21.511
- but he doesn't speak English.
- Any suspects?

11:21.598 --> 11:25.807
Yeah, an ATM surveillance camera
grabbed this jaboney fleeing the scene.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.226
All righty. Put a name to that face.

11:30.232 --> 11:31.642
That's our bad guy.

11:44.079 --> 11:45.660
He's different now.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.740
Guess we're all different now.

11:58.719 --> 12:00.334
So what did Locke say to you?

12:00.429 --> 12:02.090
He said that he wants to leave,

12:03.473 --> 12:06.135
- and we all have to go together.
- And do you believe him?

12:06.226 --> 12:07.807
I'm not sure yet.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.600
Hands up.

12:12.691 --> 12:13.771
Stop right there.

12:14.484 --> 12:15.735
Where's the man in charge?

12:15.819 --> 12:17.400
Who's she?

12:17.487 --> 12:18.988
That's Widmore's number two.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.113
What can I do for ya?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.333
You took something from us,
and we want it back.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.913
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.508
It's OK.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.505
- Do you have a fix on my position?
- Roger that.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.846
Show them what we're capable of.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.951
You have until nightfall
to return what you took.

13:09.498 --> 13:12.535
Or next time, we won't miss.

13:15.712 --> 13:18.124
Call me when you're ready
for us to pick him up.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.354
Well...

13:38.902 --> 13:40.187
Here we go.

13:55.877 --> 13:59.210
Hi. l have an appointment with
the Western Pacific Adoption Agency.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.585
- 15th floor. And sign in, please.
- Sure.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.343
Hey there.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.296
How are you?

14:09.391 --> 14:11.507
We met at the airport,
the baggage claim.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.933
-Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

14:14.021 --> 14:17.138
l'm Desmond. Desmond Hume.
I never got your name,

14:18.275 --> 14:19.481
"Claire Littleton."

14:20.694 --> 14:23.777
- So how you doin'?
- l'm OK. Better now.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.150
I actually had a bit of a scare
ended up in the hospital.

14:26.241 --> 14:29.449
- No. I'm sorry. Are you...
- No. It's all good now, so...

14:31.121 --> 14:33.237
By the way, you were right.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.239
It's a boy.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.532
l have a nose for these things.

14:39.087 --> 14:40.702
Look...

14:40.797 --> 14:44.039
Excuse me if this sounds
a bit personal, but,

14:44.134 --> 14:47.877
I couldn't help noticing you're
going to an adoption agency... alone.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.467
Yeah, you're right. It is personal.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.516
No, ljust meant you should have
some legal representation.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.053
- What, are you a lawyer?
- No. No.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.560
But, itjust so happens
that I'm on my way to see one.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.814
You know, adoption contracts
are complicated.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.442
And you should be careful
because you could find yourself

15:08.533 --> 15:10.990
in a situation that's irreversible.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.989
Yeah, I don't have money
for a lawyer.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.288
- What floor?
- I'm going to 15 as well.

15:27.177 --> 15:31.136
Look, this attorney I'm seeing,
she's excellent.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.260
You know, plus,
she owes me a favor. So...

15:34.351 --> 15:37.843
Why don't you just come and meet her?
I think she could really help you.

15:41.066 --> 15:44.058
Look, I promise you,
it won't cost you a cent.

15:45.195 --> 15:46.310
Please.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.823
It'd be my absolute pleasure.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.117
Sure.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.704
Great. This way.

16:02.546 --> 16:03.706
Thanks.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.414
Hi. Desmond Hume
to see Ms. Verdansky, please.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.418
Yes. Mr. Hume. She's expecting you.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.878
- Have a seat.
-Gmm.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.638
Hey... thank you.

16:16.351 --> 16:17.386
You're very welcome.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.343
Desmond!

16:20.897 --> 16:21.932
llana.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.518
Claire, this is llana.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.601
llana, I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Claire Littleton.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.776
l was hoping you'd be able to help her.

16:34.411 --> 16:36.026
I'm sorry.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.952
Claire Littleton from Australia?

16:39.416 --> 16:40.405
Do I know you?

16:40.917 --> 16:43.829
No, but this is quite a coincidence.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.251
We've been looking for you.

16:48.091 --> 16:52.004
Desmond, do you mind if! speak with
Ms. Littleton alone for a few minutes?

16:52.971 --> 16:55.804
No. Absolutely fine. Go right ahead.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.767
- Listen up, everyone.
- Hey.

17:09.863 --> 17:11.103
What's going on?

17:12.449 --> 17:13.734
People trying to kill us again.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.947
All this is happening
a bit sooner than I'd expected,

17:18.038 --> 17:19.903
but these people have forced our hand,

17:20.457 --> 17:22.789
claiming we stole something from them,

17:22.876 --> 17:25.242
trying to provoke us
into a confrontation.

17:25.337 --> 17:28.204
Well, if that's what they want,
that's what they'll get.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.045
Gather your things.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.545
We're going to the other island
and getting on that plane.

17:32.636 --> 17:34.797
James, I need your help
with something.

17:37.474 --> 17:40.511
There's a boat moored just a few hours
down the shore from here.

17:40.602 --> 17:44.345
I want you to get it and meet the rest
of us on the other side of these bluffs.

17:44.439 --> 17:47.556
We'll all sail over to the other island
together. Can you do that, James?

17:47.651 --> 17:49.642
How come we're not all
heading for it together?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.897
The bigger the group,
the slower it moves.

17:51.988 --> 17:53.899
All right. I could use
another pair of hands.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.446
Take whoever you want.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.151
How about it, Freckles?
Know anything about sailing?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.986
I know enough.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.073
Good. We'll be waitin' for ya.
Sayid, you got a minute?

18:15.512 --> 18:17.002
Give me a hand with somethin'?

18:22.519 --> 18:24.760
Listen up, 'cause I'm only
gonna say this once.

18:24.854 --> 18:27.812
We're not going to that rendezvous point
to pick up Locke.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.686
- I got a deal with Widmore.
- What kind of deal?

18:30.777 --> 18:35.146
Just listen. First chance you get,
you double back, hoof it to this spot.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.074
There's an old dock.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.570
Grab Hugo, Sun and Lapidus.
Kate and I will meet you there.

18:39.661 --> 18:41.617
What about Sayid and Claire?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.491
Sayid's a zombie, Claire's nuts.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.288
She gave up her ticket
when she tried to kill Kate,

18:46.376 --> 18:48.207
and I ain't gonna
let that happen again.

18:49.963 --> 18:52.875
That's Hugo, Sun and the pilot.
Only them. Understand?

18:52.966 --> 18:55.708
But how am I supposed
to get us away from Locke?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.675
You figure it out.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.637
Ready to roll?

19:05.729 --> 19:09.096
- What was that all about?
- Guy talk.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.323
I need you to go out
to where I've got Desmond.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.778
I thought you weren't
going to give him back.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.491
I'm not.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.910
You're gonna kill him.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.656
That's not gonna be a problem,
is it, Sayid?

19:27.751 --> 19:31.915
You do still want
what you asked me for, right?

19:34.632 --> 19:35.917
Yes, I do.

19:37.093 --> 19:38.594
Then go do what I said.

20:03.995 --> 20:05.906
So what did he offer you?

20:14.339 --> 20:16.455
If you're gonna shoot me
in cold blood, brother...

20:20.136 --> 20:23.299
...l have a right to know
what you're gettin' in exchange for it.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.266
He told me I could
get something back I lost.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.552
And what did you lose?

20:32.607 --> 20:34.393
The woman I loved.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.062
And where is she now?

20:42.617 --> 20:43.823
Dead.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.200
And what makes you think
Locke can bring her back?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.666
Idied...

20:52.293 --> 20:53.794
...and he brought me back.

21:01.511 --> 21:02.876
So what will you tell her?

21:03.972 --> 21:05.337
What do you mean?

21:10.478 --> 21:11.638
This woman,

21:12.522 --> 21:15.355
when she asks you what you did
to be with her again...

21:21.197 --> 21:22.482
...what will you tell her?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.297
Sayid.

21:40.550 --> 21:41.790
What's going on?

21:41.885 --> 21:43.921
Everything will be OK for you now.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.628
I took care of it.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.555
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.143
l have to leave.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.680
Did you hurt someone?

21:55.231 --> 21:56.812
Nadia, I'm leaving,

21:57.692 --> 22:00.024
and I'm never going to be
able to come back again.

22:05.450 --> 22:08.408
- What did you do, Sayid?
- Stall them.

22:16.878 --> 22:18.459
- Who is it?
- LAPD.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.954
May | see some identification?

22:23.009 --> 22:24.510
Can you open the door, please?

22:29.057 --> 22:30.843
Mrs. Jarrah, l'm Detective Straume.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.350
I need to ask you some questions.
You have a few minutes?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.444
That's good. Stay down.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.113
Sayid Jarrah?

22:55.458 --> 22:56.959
You're under arrest.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.624
There she blows.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.465
You ready to get wet?

23:12.642 --> 23:16.055
- You sure this is a good idea?
- You see a bridge?

23:17.146 --> 23:20.013
- Going back to get Locke.
- Of course not.

23:20.108 --> 23:22.394
It's a terrible idea,
which is why we ain't doing it.

23:22.485 --> 23:23.895
What?

23:23.987 --> 23:25.727
We're gonna ditch Locke.

23:25.822 --> 23:28.655
You, me, Jack, Hurley, Sun
and that pilot that looks like

23:28.741 --> 23:31.278
he's stepped off the set
of a Burt Reynolds movie.

23:31.953 --> 23:34.160
When were you planning
on telling me this?

23:34.247 --> 23:35.282
Now.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.332
- Wait. You didn't say Claire.
- 'Cause she ain't comin'.

23:42.797 --> 23:45.004
The Claire you came back for is gone.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.554
I promised I would bring her back.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.300
That was before she started
drinkin' Locke's Kool-Aid.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.632
She's dangerous. You really
want her around Aaron?

24:01.941 --> 24:04.148
Let's go. We ain't got much time.

24:39.771 --> 24:42.228
- Hey, Claire.
- Jack.

24:49.739 --> 24:51.229
How long have you been with Locke?

24:52.450 --> 24:54.031
Ever since you left.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.080
So you trust him?

24:58.915 --> 25:01.327
- Yeah.
- Why?

25:01.417 --> 25:03.908
'Cause he's the only one
that didn't abandon me.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.422
Sun, have you seen Sayid?

25:17.517 --> 25:20.054
He was supposed to catch up
with us about a half a mile back.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.471
The silent treatment?

25:34.909 --> 25:37.491
I'm sorry, Sun,
but I didn't do anything to you.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.031
James should be on his way.
Keep moving to the beach.

25:43.126 --> 25:45.788
- l'll catch up with you there.
- Where are you going?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.869
I wanna make sure
nobody got left behind.

25:54.554 --> 25:55.885
- Hurley, wait up.
- Yeah?

25:55.972 --> 25:57.303
Sun.

26:04.313 --> 26:06.019
- We have to go now.
- Go where?

26:06.107 --> 26:07.972
There's no time.
We just gotta go. Follow me.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.445
We should stick to Sawyer's plan,
or he'll be pissed.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.611
This is Sawyer's plan. Let's go.

26:33.176 --> 26:36.043
Sayid? Where have you been?

26:37.680 --> 26:39.216
Doing what you asked.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.922
Then what took you so long?

26:42.018 --> 26:43.849
| just shot an unarmed man.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.102
I needed a moment.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.142
Did you kill him, Sayid?

26:50.318 --> 26:51.774
Of course I did.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.526
Go and check, if you like.

26:59.452 --> 27:00.908
Come on. We have a boat to catch.

27:21.098 --> 27:22.804
I hope you know where you're going,

27:22.892 --> 27:25.258
'cause that smoke thing
runs a lot faster than we do.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.890
Sawyer said there'd be a dock
around here somewhere.

27:28.397 --> 27:29.386
There they are!

27:35.738 --> 27:36.727
Hey.

27:37.573 --> 27:39.825
All right. Everybody onboard. Let's go!

27:39.909 --> 27:42.992
- We sailin' home on this?
- Won't work, not without a bearing.

27:43.079 --> 27:46.947
For three years, the only way Dharma
folk got on or off this island was sub,

27:47.041 --> 27:49.282
so that's what we're doing.
Nice job, Doc.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.803
Where you going?

28:02.515 --> 28:03.800
Claire...

28:05.685 --> 28:07.846
- It's OK.
- Kate.

28:10.565 --> 28:12.055
We're leaving the island.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.691
Then why aren't you waiting for John?

28:15.778 --> 28:19.691
Because that's not John,
and whoever he is, he's not one of us.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.868
Claire... come with us.

28:26.789 --> 28:28.871
I can get you back to Aaron.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.494
- Wait a damn min...
- Sawyer, shut up.

28:31.752 --> 28:32.958
She is coming or I'm not.

28:35.631 --> 28:36.962
Come with us, Claire.

28:40.094 --> 28:42.210
- John promised me...
- No, I'm promising you.

28:44.807 --> 28:47.139
l was there when he was born.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.888
And I never should've raised him.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.559
lt should've been you.

28:55.902 --> 28:58.188
I came back to get you
so you could be with him again.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.988
It's the only reason I came back
to the island, Claire.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.654
So, please, come with us.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.535
Let's go home.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.789
Get on the boat before Locke gets here.

29:29.101 --> 29:30.932
He finds out we're gone...

29:33.856 --> 29:35.016
...he's gonna be mad.

29:47.161 --> 29:48.492
It's your mom.

29:49.372 --> 29:51.112
Hey.

29:51.207 --> 29:52.788
Yeah, we just got here.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.700
Thank you.

29:56.712 --> 30:00.045
I don't know. I'll have him home
as soon as I can. Maybe, like, 5:00?

30:01.676 --> 30:04.793
Actually, we might grab
a bite to eat afterwards.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.720
So... maybe more like 7:00?

30:09.058 --> 30:11.219
All right. Yeah.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.222
Yeah, I'll drop him off.

30:17.733 --> 30:21.646
Hey. You know, hearing your
grandfather's will being read,

30:21.737 --> 30:23.898
I know it's not the most fun, but...

30:24.365 --> 30:28.358
...it'll be over soon, I promise.
And it's OK to be sad.

30:29.954 --> 30:31.490
I'm sad for you, Dad.

30:36.460 --> 30:37.666
Let's go.

30:39.422 --> 30:40.628
Mr. Shephard.

30:42.425 --> 30:45.007
- Hello.
- And you must be David.

30:45.094 --> 30:48.177
- Hi.
- We're set up in the conference room.

30:48.806 --> 30:50.296
I've got a surprise for you.

30:51.642 --> 30:53.178
Do you believe in fate?

30:58.774 --> 31:00.310
This is Claire Littleton.

31:00.943 --> 31:03.935
Claire, this is Mr. Shephard
and his son David.

31:05.489 --> 31:07.946
Hello. I'm Jack Shephard.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.774
Hi, it's really nice to meet you.

31:12.580 --> 31:14.946
- You found her.
- Actually, she found us.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.161
You were in my father's will.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.836
Do you mind if! ask you
how you knew him?

31:30.473 --> 31:32.134
He was my father, too.

31:53.329 --> 31:57.072
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
This is the service.

31:58.459 --> 31:59.915
Yeah, this is Dr. Shephard.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.414
No, no, it's not a very good time.

32:04.673 --> 32:07.631
Yes, they can go ahead and prep him.
I'm 20 minutes away.

32:12.348 --> 32:16.011
I'm so sorry. There's been
an emergency at the hospital, and...

32:18.896 --> 32:20.636
We're gonna have to reschedule.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.202
I know I'm a little late
to the party, Captain,

32:41.293 --> 32:43.500
but you mind filling us in
on what your game plan is?

32:44.130 --> 32:46.872
My plan, Chesty,
is to land on Hydra island,

32:47.716 --> 32:49.627
get ourselves nice and cuddly
with Widmore

32:50.302 --> 32:52.008
until we get a chance
to jump on that sub.

32:52.847 --> 32:55.805
Then I'm gonna put a gun in someone's
face and make 'em take us home.

32:56.767 --> 32:58.223
I like that idea.

32:59.436 --> 33:02.428
I saw some canned food down
in the galley. Anybody else starvin'?

33:10.489 --> 33:12.821
Freckles. Take the wheel a minute?

33:12.908 --> 33:14.068
Sure.

33:17.079 --> 33:19.240
- Be nice.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.579
Didn't think you'd show up, Doc.

33:31.427 --> 33:34.715
- Sorry?
- Taking orders ain't your strong suit.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.545
Nice to see you finally came around.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.803
- This doesn't feel right.
- What doesn't feel right?

33:45.024 --> 33:46.264
Leaving the island.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.521
You wanna tell me why not?

33:57.411 --> 33:59.743
Because I remember how I felt
last time I left...

34:02.333 --> 34:03.914
...like a part of me was missing.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.833
We were brought here because
we're supposed to do something, James.

34:11.217 --> 34:15.130
And if Locke... that...
that thing, wants us to leave?

34:17.306 --> 34:19.342
Maybe it's afraid
of what happens if we stay.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.511
Get off my damn boat.

34:27.024 --> 34:28.013
What?

34:28.108 --> 34:30.690
You got a decision to make
and you make it now.

34:30.778 --> 34:32.018
Either you're with us,

34:32.112 --> 34:34.819
you keep that crazy talk to yourself,
or you're going in the water.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.367
James, this is a mistake.

34:38.369 --> 34:40.701
And I know there's a part of you
that feels that.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.914
The island is not done with us yet.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.250
Yeah, well, I'm done with this island.

34:45.334 --> 34:48.246
So if you wanna take a leap of faith,
Jack, then take it.

34:50.923 --> 34:52.459
Get off my damn boat.

35:05.854 --> 35:07.685
I'm sorry that I got Juliet killed.

35:24.373 --> 35:25.579
Jack?

35:26.709 --> 35:27.824
Jack?

35:30.713 --> 35:33.625
- What did you say to him?
- He changed his mind.

35:33.716 --> 35:36.423
What do you mean, he changed his mind?
What did you say?!

35:36.510 --> 35:37.920
He ain't comin' with us.

35:40.681 --> 35:44.173
- We have to go back and get him.
- We're done going back, Kate.

37:05.099 --> 37:07.932
So all these years, you had no idea
your dad had another kid?

37:08.644 --> 37:10.384
Nope. None.

37:10.479 --> 37:13.221
Wow. I can't believe
he never even mentioned her.

37:13.690 --> 37:16.818
Yeah, well, your grandfather
kept a lot of things to himself.

37:20.489 --> 37:21.979
Yeah, probably.

37:23.033 --> 37:26.446
All right. You gonna be OK
hangin' while I do this?

37:26.954 --> 37:28.034
Yeah, sure.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.196
Good luck, Dad.

37:32.126 --> 37:33.115
Thanks.

37:42.678 --> 37:45.260
- Car v. ped.
- How bad?

37:45.681 --> 37:49.344
Bad. But here's the kicker,
the victim was already in a wheelchair.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.016
Pre-existing spinal condition.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.763
- Dural sac's obliterated.
- That's why we called you.

37:55.858 --> 37:57.394
We're in a bit over our heads here.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.183
Yeah.

38:00.988 --> 38:02.319
I got this.

38:10.497 --> 38:12.533
- We ready to cut?
- Say the word.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.705
Scalpel.

38:26.346 --> 38:27.335
What is it?

38:29.141 --> 38:30.551
I think I know this guy.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.358
Nice day for a swim.

39:05.761 --> 39:07.501
Sawyer took my boat, didn't he?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.178
Yeah.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.939
Everybody stay close.
The camp's over here.

39:23.278 --> 39:26.441
Not much time before Locke figures out
we made off with his ride.

39:26.532 --> 39:27.942
Hands up!

39:28.033 --> 39:29.898
- Hey!
- Drop your weapons!

39:30.327 --> 39:32.488
- Take it easy!
- Drop them now!

39:42.548 --> 39:44.129
It's all right. I know him.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.883
- Who else is with you?
- Nobody!

39:47.970 --> 39:50.882
If you're wondering where Locke is,
he's still back on the main island.

39:53.267 --> 39:54.803
Turn the fences off.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.555
Ford just showed up on
a boat with five of his friends.

40:03.569 --> 40:04.649
Sun?

40:07.948 --> 40:09.154
Jin?

40:13.620 --> 40:14.905
- Jin!
- Sun!

40:25.591 --> 40:27.001
I love you.

40:28.552 --> 40:29.758
I love you, too.

40:35.350 --> 40:37.682
I never stopped looking for you.

40:38.979 --> 40:41.061
Looks like someone
got their voice back.

40:42.566 --> 40:44.147
We'll never be apart again.

40:45.819 --> 40:47.104
I promise you.

40:59.499 --> 41:00.830
Are you sure?

41:02.794 --> 41:06.002
- I understand, Charles.
- That Widmore?

41:08.258 --> 41:09.873
What the hell are you doin'?

41:12.054 --> 41:14.261
What's it look like I'm doin'?
Hands up now.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.886
On your knees, all of you!

41:22.022 --> 41:23.228
Down!

41:25.317 --> 41:28.059
- We had a deal!
- Deal's off.

41:31.990 --> 41:32.979
We got 'em.

41:33.075 --> 41:34.485
If you've got a sightline on Locke,

41:35.243 --> 41:36.744
- fire when ready.
- Roger.

41:43.335 --> 41:44.324
Get down!

42:10.237 --> 42:12.444
Jack? You all right?

42:14.199 --> 42:16.736
Don't worry. It's gonna be OK.

42:19.413 --> 42:20.619
You're with me now.
