WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:04.192
What are you looking at?
You've never seen goat's blood before?

00:04.240 --> 00:06.880
Your son.
<i>—</i> We'll name him Astyanax.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.194
Why did you leave me?

00:09.480 --> 00:12.711
PRIAM:
Let him be a lesson to us all.

00:12.760 --> 00:15.513
You know I can get you out.
<i>—</i> I didn't ask for that.

00:17.840 --> 00:19.592
You sent another man out in your armour.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.839
ACHILLES:
Hector!

00:21.880 --> 00:25.032
When you get to the river man,
pause a while.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.674
Your wife and your son
will be there shortly.

00:50.440 --> 00:51.475
Achilles...

00:52.760 --> 00:54.831
They're asking again for it
to be returned.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.389
Then you can give them the same answer.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.200
They're desperate.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.709
So find words for my grief, Odysseus.

01:06.320 --> 01:10.996
Paint pictures of my rage and then tell them
they'll get no body from me.

01:34.840 --> 01:37.992
BABY CRIES

01:40.960 --> 01:42.553
MAID:
Please, my lady.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.193
Let us feed him.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.158
You've no milk left.

01:52.160 --> 01:53.958
All I ever wanted was a child.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.479
Now I have him,
the reason I wanted him is gone.

02:15.440 --> 02:18.000
Maybe you should let them
take the baby for a while.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.034
Get some sleep.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.319
Why did you come here?

02:35.880 --> 02:37.234
PARIS:
How is she?

02:38.160 --> 02:40.310
I can't get her to speak.

02:50.560 --> 02:51.914
Mother.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.150
Listen. We've sent messengers.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.838
We'll get him back.

03:08.760 --> 03:09.989
Can you hear me?

03:12.440 --> 03:15.273
Come over here. Hm.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.150
There's no point in blaming yourself.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.436
I want you to lead the army.

03:35.920 --> 03:36.910
Why me?

03:37.680 --> 03:42.151
Troilus and Deiphobus
don't have your gift with the men.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.474
They're good soldiers.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.194
But you can win men's hearts.

03:49.760 --> 03:51.797
You won Hector's after all.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.399
A warning, though.

04:01.120 --> 04:03.794
The city needs to know
where your allegiance lies.

04:03.840 --> 04:05.319
You love Helen. That's fine.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.839
But from now on

04:07.880 --> 04:11.316
the city comes first.

04:14.240 --> 04:15.958
Now, tell me the truth.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.714
Did you send messengers
to the Greeks?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.280
And...?

04:30.200 --> 04:32.635
Achilles refuses to return the body.

04:37.280 --> 04:42.958
INDISTINCT WHISPERED PRAYERS

05:01.720 --> 05:03.870
The Amazons are mourning their dead.

05:06.160 --> 05:07.514
PARIS:
And so would we.

05:09.080 --> 05:10.832
If we had a body to mourn.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.317
PARIS SIGHS

05:16.640 --> 05:17.835
What is it?

05:21.880 --> 05:24.633
Father wants me to take over
Hector's position.

05:27.520 --> 05:28.794
And you said yes?

05:29.800 --> 05:30.995
I have to.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.479
For my brother.

05:38.080 --> 05:39.639
What if they kill you, too?

05:39.680 --> 05:40.954
PARIS:
They won't.

05:41.720 --> 05:43.438
I don't want to lose you.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.950
Hey...

05:49.520 --> 05:50.476
Listen.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.878
I've died once in that river.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.718
I'm not interested in dying again.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.673
Alexander.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.629
Father's disappeared.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.476
You! You there!

06:17.840 --> 06:19.399
Have you seen the king?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.154
Sorry, my lord.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.952
I'm your general. Tell me where he is.

06:26.640 --> 06:28.950
He gave strict orders.
No one was to follow him.

06:29.760 --> 06:30.670
Open the gates.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.069
TROILUS:
Should we go after him?

06:36.960 --> 06:38.951
PARIS:
No, let him go.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.395
Stop there.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.875
Do you know me?

07:06.880 --> 07:09.030
I've come to fetch the body of my son.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.559
I am alone.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.798
Don't waste my time, boy.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.160
Put a knife in my chest

07:14.200 --> 07:16.760
or take me to the man
who killed my son.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.273
I'm a Myrmidon, sir.

07:22.760 --> 07:24.558
One of Achilles' men.

07:25.240 --> 07:26.753
Then it's my lucky day, isn't it?

07:28.160 --> 07:29.355
Let's go.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.518
You shouldn't have to see this.

07:59.480 --> 08:00.550
What's your name?

08:01.200 --> 08:02.759
Kaidas, sir.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.757
Tell him I'm here, Kaidas.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.798
Give him this.

08:21.160 --> 08:24.039
Achilles, King Priam is here.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.957
You know why I came.

08:42.080 --> 08:43.558
Go home, old man.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.034
There's nothing here for you.

08:49.360 --> 08:51.271
I won't leave till I have him.

09:02.800 --> 09:05.997
I'm staying until he grants me
my request.

09:08.880 --> 09:10.109
Tell him.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.794
HECUBA:
Hector?

09:15.480 --> 09:18.359
Hector, is that you?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.596
No, it's me. Alexander.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.752
Alexander. Come here.

09:23.560 --> 09:24.914
Come here.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.476
OK. OK.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.874
It's OK.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.195
It's OK.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.194
Where's Priam?

09:35.160 --> 09:36.275
Where is he?

09:41.240 --> 09:43.231
DISTANT SOLDIERS YELLS

09:47.760 --> 09:50.115
If you don't leave before it's light

09:50.160 --> 09:52.356
I can't protect you
from what might happen.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.629
I told you.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.953
I'm not going back alone.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.469
I'd rather die here with my son.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.719
Bring him in.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.271
Hector brought this on himself.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.674
On the beach.

10:21.240 --> 10:22.799
He showed no mercy.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.558
We know what he did.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.630
His mother wants to bury him.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.396
Like you buried Patroclus.

10:34.840 --> 10:37.514
Your son is not worthy of burial.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.200
Why was Patroclus in your armour?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.719
I refused to fight.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.637
And the reason?

10:56.320 --> 10:57.549
The king.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.838
Agamemnon took my spoils.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.073
A girl from Cilicia.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.392
He took her for his own
when he'd done nothing to win her.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.080
So you took offense?
<i>—</i> Yes.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.440
So...

11:17.200 --> 11:21.080
Why did Patroclus disobey you?

11:30.120 --> 11:31.190
Hm?

11:33.640 --> 11:35.711
Patroclus insisted we did our duty.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.277
Defend what was ours.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.519
I told him not to do it
and he wouldn't listen.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.038
Well, not everyone has your strength,
Achilles.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.190
It takes a mighty pride

11:59.400 --> 12:02.472
to do nothing when the world
is falling around you.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.875
Patroclus was reckless.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.760
He was human.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.029
Say it.

12:15.160 --> 12:18.118
If I had been, he would still be here.
Right?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.311
And so would my son.

12:31.560 --> 12:32.959
Tell me about him.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.435
What do you mean?

12:35.480 --> 12:37.471
Hector.
<i>—</i> What?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.397
What was he like as a child?

12:40.440 --> 12:42.511
He was a terror.
What do you expect?

12:46.000 --> 12:47.115
Me, too.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.799
His mother spoilt him,
but he grew up and...

12:53.280 --> 12:55.715
Well, he became a better man
than me.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.193
Hector had his mother's...

13:05.520 --> 13:06.919
HE SIGHS

13:09.440 --> 13:10.475
...calm.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.712
He always knew what was needed.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.830
He...

13:24.640 --> 13:27.678
he really was the best of men.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.039
PRIAM WEEPS

13:32.320 --> 13:33.594
Get him some water.

13:43.160 --> 13:44.355
His mother.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.597
She will die without his body.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.119
Brother, help me.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.155
Please.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.589
What happened?

14:36.640 --> 14:37.835
You slept.

14:39.280 --> 14:40.509
Where are your men?

14:42.840 --> 14:44.433
Outside.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.599
Preparing your son's body
for the journey back.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.234
I'll need a mourning period.
No fighting.

15:09.280 --> 15:11.191
How long?
<i>—</i> Twelve days.

15:13.680 --> 15:14.670
You'll have it.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.189
I'll need food for his funeral meal.

15:17.240 --> 15:19.231
Wood from the forests for his coffin.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.679
You'll have it.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.711
I should go before it gets too light.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.231
I am sorry for your loss.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.560
SOLDIER:
Open the gate!

15:43.560 --> 15:44.630
Move out!

16:47.520 --> 16:49.238
You refused to fight.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.112
You sat in your tent like a woman.

16:51.160 --> 16:55.040
And now without consultation
you give him 12 days' mourning?

16:55.080 --> 16:56.673
He came to me alone.

16:56.720 --> 16:58.631
That was worthy of my respect.

16:58.680 --> 16:59.909
You should have told us he was here!

16:59.960 --> 17:01.189
And you'd have killed him!

17:01.240 --> 17:04.358
No. We'd have offered him up for ransom.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.959
Got Helen back.

17:07.240 --> 17:08.230
Strategy.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.953
Trickery. Guile.

17:11.319 --> 17:12.435
Is that what war is?

17:14.359 --> 17:15.953
Is that all we are?

17:18.240 --> 17:20.914
Enough of your mouth! Enough!

17:25.079 --> 17:26.718
Now, he lost his son!

17:27.359 --> 17:29.431
I've given him 12 days.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.595
On my honour!

17:32.800 --> 17:34.837
We will observe it like men.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.315
Is that clear?

17:43.480 --> 17:44.470
Good.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.198
12 days is too long.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.356
They'll have time to reinforce the city.

17:55.760 --> 17:56.875
Prepare an attack.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.517
I'm not waiting for that bastard
anymore.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.793
I don't trust the Greeks will hold
to their side of this agreement.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.797
No meddling from any of you.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.751
Let the truce happen. Clear?

18:18.240 --> 18:20.311
She's the one who interfered.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.192
Telling them the curse was lifted.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.038
Alexander's heart stopped in that river.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.434
He died.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.871
You don't decide fate, Aphrodite.
None of us do.

18:28.920 --> 18:31.196
But it's not...
<i>—</i> Just let be.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.840
I can't see him.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.675
I just can't.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.075
Alright.

19:01.920 --> 19:03.194
I'll see to it.

19:06.920 --> 19:09.150
ANDROMACHE SINGS

19:21.160 --> 19:25.711
WOMEN JOIN IN SINGING

20:33.240 --> 20:34.469
Are the rooms alright?

20:35.240 --> 20:36.674
I'm afraid it's all we have.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.154
I'm used to bare ground.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.153
Can't sleep on feathers.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.679
Can I help you?

20:43.720 --> 20:46.473
We no longer have enough men
to guard the walls from all sides.

20:47.360 --> 20:49.271
I was wondering whether...
<i>—</i> How many do you need?

20:50.280 --> 20:51.998
I think 20 women should do it.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.995
Two shifts.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.479
So 40 in all.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.279
I saw you at her grave.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.869
You were close.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.994
She died honourably.

21:14.640 --> 21:15.789
I lost my love.

21:17.720 --> 21:19.040
In my home city.

21:20.840 --> 21:21.830
War?

21:22.920 --> 21:24.069
Disease.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.394
Before this all started.

21:26.880 --> 21:29.759
One forgets there are other ways to die.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.559
Men and me...

21:49.480 --> 21:50.709
It doesn't happen.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.550
It's a shame.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.353
You're quite a picture.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.515
I-lesion.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.675
What is it, Evander?

22:19.200 --> 22:20.349
I saw Telemon.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.355
What do you mean?

22:24.840 --> 22:26.274
He's hiding in the city.

22:27.320 --> 22:28.958
Says he doesn't want to fight.

22:30.440 --> 22:31.874
There was blood on his floor.

22:40.720 --> 22:42.279
Why didn't you tell me?

22:42.320 --> 22:43.719
He said not to.

22:45.720 --> 22:46.755
It's alright.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.314
You just tell me where he is, OK?

22:54.280 --> 22:55.600
MEN YELL OUTSIDE

22:59.400 --> 23:00.879
CLATTERING

23:25.600 --> 23:26.749
GUARD:
Is this him?

23:29.480 --> 23:30.754
Where was the blood?

23:38.480 --> 23:39.550
There.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.030
Open it.

23:54.520 --> 23:55.635
GUARD COUGHS

24:30.640 --> 24:31.675
It's quiet.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.234
Where is everyone?

24:35.880 --> 24:37.712
By the sea. Getting some rest.

24:38.360 --> 24:39.873
This isn't about rest.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.271
It's a period of mourning for the dead.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.118
We agreed to observe it.

24:46.960 --> 24:49.110
But if you're asking us to do
nothing but weep

24:50.640 --> 24:52.233
Achilles, I can't help you.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.715
Drink.

25:20.760 --> 25:22.114
When this is over...

25:23.480 --> 25:25.039
you'll return to Penelope.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.515
Yeah.

25:28.080 --> 25:29.354
If she remembers me.

25:30.840 --> 25:33.275
Agamemnon will return
to Clytemnestra.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.956
Menelaus will return with his prize.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.199
Where will I go?

25:47.040 --> 25:48.394
You'll find somewhere.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.395
Sometimes feel as though
I don't belong on this earth.

26:18.200 --> 26:19.076
Where is he?

26:19.840 --> 26:20.910
His tent.

26:21.720 --> 26:23.677
We're keeping preparations from him.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.079
We've been thinking.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.031
We'll need him when it comes
to the attack.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.997
He'd rather kill us than break his promise.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.190
The men are tired, Odysseus.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.398
The food stores are low.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.558
This has to be the last battle.

26:39.360 --> 26:40.953
And we need Achilles with us.

26:43.800 --> 26:44.790
HOW?

26:46.160 --> 26:47.355
We'll find a way.

27:01.040 --> 27:05.079
WHISPERING ETHEREAL VOICES

27:07.400 --> 27:08.993
DOOR OPENS

27:15.760 --> 27:17.717
We have a prisoner. Greek.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.115
He says he's from Thrace
but Aeneas doesn't believe it.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.390
He had the dead body of a grain worker
in his house.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.595
Where is he?
<i>—</i> We're keeping him in the granary.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.309
I'm going there now.

27:27.360 --> 27:28.839
Has he said anything?
<i>—</i> Not yet.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.838
He says he wants to speak to me.
<i>—</i> Why you?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.118
A message from Menelaus, I imagine.

27:37.280 --> 27:38.315
Let me come.

27:38.960 --> 27:39.950
YQU?

27:40.760 --> 27:41.830
Why?

27:43.840 --> 27:47.037
If he's one of Menelaus' men,
maybe I'll know him from Sparta.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.390
Alright.

27:54.680 --> 27:58.753
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

28:04.680 --> 28:05.590
Look up.

28:06.240 --> 28:07.389
Show your face.

28:16.240 --> 28:17.435
You know him?

28:20.520 --> 28:22.875
No. I don't think so.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.320
You wanted to speak to me, Greek?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.192
Not much grain left here.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.155
Troy doesn't have, long it would seem.

28:33.440 --> 28:36.114
The man you killed, he worked here.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.835
He filled these barrels
every day of his life.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.553
Until you ended it.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.637
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

28:43.680 --> 28:45.273
My name is Telemon.
<i>—</i> That's a lie!

28:46.240 --> 28:48.470
It may work with bakers' sons
but not with me.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.071
If you want to live

28:51.920 --> 28:53.194
talk.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.234
My name is Xanthius.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.591
Ithaca-born. Odysseus' man.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.839
How did you get into the city?

29:11.840 --> 29:13.513
I smuggled myself in.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.879
Before the siege started.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.515
Why?

29:19.440 --> 29:21.033
Odysseus thought I might be useful.

29:22.640 --> 29:26.713
And then the day you and your brother
left for Cilicia

29:26.760 --> 29:28.797
I let two Greeks into the city.

29:28.840 --> 29:29.875
PARIS:
Who?

29:31.680 --> 29:32.829
Odysseus?

29:34.960 --> 29:35.870
Menelaus?

29:39.960 --> 29:41.553
Achilles?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.034
To do what?

29:46.160 --> 29:47.150
Get information.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.310
From who?

29:51.760 --> 29:54.718
A friend.
<i>—</i> What friend?

29:54.760 --> 29:56.114
Was it Pandarus?

29:56.720 --> 29:57.835
AENEAS:
Speak!

30:01.960 --> 30:05.476
The friend told Achilles
about your journey to Cilicia.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.395
Then the granary guard
saw them together.

30:13.240 --> 30:14.639
PARIS:
So you killed him.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.596
AENEAS:
Who was this friend Achilles met?

30:21.080 --> 30:22.479
We need a name.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.476
I made a promise to serve.

30:31.320 --> 30:33.675
And I do not betray promises.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.953
I believe my loyalty will be rewarded.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.676
XANTHIUS GROANS

30:56.240 --> 30:57.799
Silence the horses' bridles.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.796
SOLDIER:
Yes, sir.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.596
INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE

31:47.000 --> 31:48.434
Still nothing?

31:56.320 --> 31:58.118
Tell us who Achilles met

31:58.160 --> 31:59.878
and this can all be over.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.152
XANTHIUS SCREAMS

32:17.200 --> 32:18.873
Speak and it ends, Greek.

32:22.360 --> 32:23.839
Stop this.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.311
He can stop it himself.
— WHIP CRACKS

32:39.720 --> 32:40.915
XANTHIUS SCREAMS

32:40.960 --> 32:42.109
Helen.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.710
Helen!

32:46.040 --> 32:47.394
What happened?

32:47.960 --> 32:49.314
You should stop it.

32:50.040 --> 32:52.395
It's not human.
<i>—</i> Human?

32:53.800 --> 32:55.438
That bastard betrayed our city.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.710
He killed a Trojan with his bare hands.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.639
That's no reason for us
to behave like beasts.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.876
You feel sympathy for him
because of where he comes from.

33:03.920 --> 33:04.910
That's not true.

33:04.960 --> 33:09.113
Helen, this is a war we're fighting.

33:12.800 --> 33:14.438
It's because of you and me.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.915
You think I forget that for one moment?

33:18.840 --> 33:21.036
I think that you need to decide
who you are.

33:22.120 --> 33:23.918
One of us.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.679
Or... one of them.

33:36.280 --> 33:38.556
Hey! You!

33:47.480 --> 33:49.391
Thought I heard something in those reeds.

33:51.680 --> 33:52.715
THERSITES:
Maybe it's nothing.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.592
We should probably make sure.

33:55.800 --> 33:56.631
Yeah.

34:22.679 --> 34:24.239
KAIDAS SCREAMS

34:26.159 --> 34:29.277
Help! We've been attacked!
Help me!

34:33.639 --> 34:34.960
THERSITES:
They're attacking.

35:02.360 --> 35:03.430
ACHILLES:
What happened?

35:06.040 --> 35:07.394
THERSITES:
It was a Trojan ambush.

35:08.960 --> 35:10.871
Two of the men were Priam's sons.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.870
He's one of your own men, Achilles.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.999
This is a period of mourning.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.680
I had Priam's word.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.393
You can see what that means.

35:34.800 --> 35:35.949
Is this true?

35:46.240 --> 35:47.389
True.

35:54.600 --> 35:55.954
ACHILLES:
Get me my armour.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.674
SOLDIERS CLAMOUR

36:14.520 --> 36:16.796
The things I do for my country.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.552
BABY CRIES

36:55.400 --> 36:58.711
In the absence of my wife

36:58.760 --> 37:00.592
on behalf of us both

37:01.720 --> 37:04.519
I drink to our son, Hector.

37:04.560 --> 37:05.436
ALL:
Hector.

37:07.600 --> 37:11.594
His child will carry his spirit into the future.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.269
Hector will live in Astyanax.

37:18.200 --> 37:19.713
Forever.

37:19.760 --> 37:22.229
ALL:
Astyanax.

37:31.200 --> 37:34.318
My father has asked me

37:35.680 --> 37:37.751
to take my brother's place
as head of the army.

37:39.160 --> 37:40.559
I accept with pride.

37:42.680 --> 37:43.909
As a Trojan.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.190
A brother.

37:50.960 --> 37:51.916
And a son.

37:54.720 --> 37:58.156
When I first came here
I did not know who I was.

37:58.200 --> 37:59.713
Hector taught me.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.916
Sometimes he had to beat it into me.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.157
But we grew to admire each other.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.509
Love each other.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.757
I vow to live in Hector's name.

38:20.480 --> 38:22.153
To aspire to his virtue.

38:24.160 --> 38:25.798
And to protect those he loved.

38:29.000 --> 38:29.910
To Hector.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.520
ALL:
Hector.

38:32.560 --> 38:36.474
BATTLE PREPARATIONS
SOUND OUTSIDE

38:39.200 --> 38:42.272
HORSES WHINNY AND TROT BY

38:44.320 --> 38:46.231
You're attacking
during the mourning period.

38:50.360 --> 38:52.078
You want to object?

38:52.840 --> 38:54.592
You want to say something?

38:54.640 --> 38:56.472
'Cause I'll give you something to object to.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.798
SOLDIERS MARCH OUTSIDE

39:10.080 --> 39:11.275
When I get back.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.077
HORSE WHINNIES

39:41.320 --> 39:42.674
Achilles is ready.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.920
HORSE WHINNIES

39:56.800 --> 39:57.949
My brother.

39:58.720 --> 40:01.234
Many years ago
I said I'd avenge your shame.

40:03.800 --> 40:04.790
Now I shall.

40:16.800 --> 40:18.393
That was foolish.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.834
Just kill me.

40:23.960 --> 40:25.394
Let me join my brother.

40:44.360 --> 40:47.000
Flee tonight when the battle begins.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.113
My men won't stop you.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.433
If there was a traitor

41:06.680 --> 41:08.159
it must have been Pandarus.

41:09.160 --> 41:11.197
Then why doesn't the Greek say so?

41:11.960 --> 41:13.633
No need to protect a dead man.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.514
TROILUS SCOFFS
If not him, then who?

41:17.560 --> 41:19.198
Whoever it is

41:20.680 --> 41:21.875
we'll find out.

41:25.480 --> 41:26.914
I'd like to propose a toast

41:28.360 --> 41:29.680
on this day of mourning

41:30.440 --> 41:32.556
to the woman who caused all this.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.069
Andromache...
<i>—</i> Well, it's true, isn't it?

41:35.120 --> 41:36.838
She lured Alexander here.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.199
She seduced him.

41:39.240 --> 41:41.311
Andromache, this is a meal
for your husband.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.954
Hector would want me to speak the truth.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.235
I knew Pandarus.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.916
He loved this city.
He would never betray it.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.990
But he would try to find out
the person who did.

41:57.680 --> 41:58.909
That's a lie.

41:58.960 --> 42:00.030
Is it?

42:01.240 --> 42:02.753
What if Menelaus knew it all?

42:05.120 --> 42:06.599
What if he sent you here?

42:07.320 --> 42:08.833
To give him a pretext.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.277
To destroy the city.
To eliminate Troy.

42:11.320 --> 42:12.594
That's not true.

42:12.640 --> 42:13.710
Andromache, that's enough.

42:13.760 --> 42:15.910
If I find out my husband died
because of you...

42:15.960 --> 42:17.155
PARIS:
Stop her!

42:18.760 --> 42:19.795
Let me go. Let me go.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.229
Take Helen out.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.871
Why me? Take her out!
<i>—</i> Traitor!

42:25.920 --> 42:27.069
Just get her out of here!

42:59.400 --> 43:01.550
Why didn't you send her out of the room?

43:04.200 --> 43:06.191
She lost her husband.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.518
Do you believe what she said?

43:14.200 --> 43:15.793
That I lured you?

43:16.520 --> 43:18.272
That I'm Menelaus' vassal?

43:18.320 --> 43:19.549
Of course not.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.393
I fell in love with you.

43:23.440 --> 43:24.396
That's what happened.

43:24.440 --> 43:25.999
This war will end.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.956
Things will return to normal.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.039
No, they won't.

43:34.400 --> 43:35.993
They'll never return.

43:36.040 --> 43:37.439
What?

43:37.480 --> 43:39.232
I can't stay here.

43:41.240 --> 43:42.833
EAGLE SCREECHES

43:44.000 --> 43:45.320
Let's leave.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.429
Together.

43:48.240 --> 43:49.878
We could escape tonight.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.470
What do we need but each other?

43:53.000 --> 43:54.832
They'll never accept me, Paris.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.631
If we don't go now, we never will.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.278
I can't leave.

44:07.880 --> 44:08.995
Why not?

44:10.760 --> 44:12.353
The city needs me.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.674
I need you.

44:14.440 --> 44:15.669
Doesn't that mean anything?

44:15.720 --> 44:18.360
Of course it does.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.393
But they took me in.

44:23.600 --> 44:25.159
They suffered for me.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.072
Hector died for me.

44:30.840 --> 44:32.319
I have a daughter.

44:32.360 --> 44:33.680
I haven't seen her in years.

44:33.720 --> 44:35.154
I left her for you.

44:35.200 --> 44:36.793
Not for anything else, Paris.

44:36.840 --> 44:38.513
It's not Paris!

44:40.560 --> 44:42.119
That's a shepherd's name.

44:43.720 --> 44:45.040
I'm Alexander.

44:45.680 --> 44:50.038
The name given to me by my family.

44:50.680 --> 44:53.115
But I didn't choose to run away
with Alexander.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.351
I ran away with Paris.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.514
Well, I'm not him anymore.

45:01.360 --> 45:03.033
And Troy is my home.

45:05.560 --> 45:06.789
It's not mine.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.517
MAN:
The Greeks! They're coming!

45:11.560 --> 45:14.313
MEN CLAMOUR OUTSIDE

45:15.960 --> 45:17.792
MAN:
Greeks! Greeks approaching!

45:19.280 --> 45:21.317
MAN:
Run as quick as you can!

45:21.520 --> 45:24.353
There are Greeks approaching
on the plain.

45:24.400 --> 45:26.960
SOLDIERS CLAMOUR

45:27.000 --> 45:28.434
What's happening?

45:30.280 --> 45:32.157
They've broken the truce.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.713
My father had a promise.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.479
12 days!
<i>—</i> Paris. Don't go. Please.

45:49.920 --> 45:53.038
SOLDIERS GRUNT IN UNISON

46:13.880 --> 46:16.315
Where is Priam?!

46:16.800 --> 46:19.872
Where is Priam?!

46:36.080 --> 46:37.718
Where is the liar?!

46:42.440 --> 46:43.839
HORSE WHINNIES

46:43.880 --> 46:47.714
LOUD BATTLE CRY

46:49.040 --> 46:50.872
HE YELLS

47:08.640 --> 47:10.074
BATTLE CRY

48:35.760 --> 48:36.955
You'll follow me.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.594
<i>Yak“!</i>

49:06.640 --> 49:09.075
12 days, he said. 12 days!

49:09.120 --> 49:11.031
You can't fight him. He'll murder you!

49:11.080 --> 49:13.071
I have to go.
<i>—</i> Priam!

49:21.720 --> 49:23.040
Priam!

49:23.680 --> 49:24.954
Where are you?!

49:37.080 --> 49:38.878
You broke the truce.

49:38.920 --> 49:40.513
You broke it!

49:40.560 --> 49:41.436
Lies!

49:46.600 --> 49:49.240
You killed one of my men in cold blood!

49:49.280 --> 49:50.873
Greek trickery! Not ours!

49:52.160 --> 49:53.719
NO! No!

50:00.800 --> 50:02.473
Odysseus wouldn't do that.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.309
HORSE NEIGHS

50:06.320 --> 50:07.230
<i>Yak“!</i>

50:11.560 --> 50:12.436
<i>Yak“!</i>

50:19.960 --> 50:21.394
May the gods forgive you.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.996
PRIAM GROANS

50:55.240 --> 50:56.469
Lies.

50:57.920 --> 50:58.990
Treachery.

50:59.040 --> 51:00.189
We didn't lie.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.951
You Greeks broke the truce.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.877
You killed one of my men!

51:04.920 --> 51:07.355
We never left the city during the truce.

51:09.240 --> 51:11.072
Swear that on your brother's grave.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.394
I swear it.

51:19.440 --> 51:21.875
You were betrayed by your own side.

51:29.560 --> 51:31.437
ACHILLES CHUCKLES AND CHOKES

51:33.840 --> 51:35.751
Tell Odysseus.

51:37.680 --> 51:39.114
To him the glory.

51:41.720 --> 51:44.109
This was always a shabby war.

52:49.040 --> 52:50.394
Where is she?

52:52.400 --> 52:53.879
Where is she?!

52:54.640 --> 52:56.199
Where is she?!

53:09.400 --> 53:11.073
I loved him, Nestor.

53:13.960 --> 53:15.473
Tell the king it's over.

53:17.080 --> 53:18.400
We're done here.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.911
We're going to win this war

54:07.600 --> 54:10.240
and everything will be forgotten.

54:12.400 --> 54:13.913
You're such a good man.

54:17.920 --> 54:19.274
I don't deserve you.

54:19.320 --> 54:21.038
Of course you do.

54:30.400 --> 54:32.357
Alexander, listen.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.836
I was wrong to suggest we leave.

54:42.520 --> 54:43.635
Forgive me.

54:45.360 --> 54:46.794
This is your city.

54:47.560 --> 54:49.278
Of course you have to stay.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.433
They will accept you.

55:02.280 --> 55:03.679
Just give it time.

55:04.440 --> 55:05.794
That's all they need.

55:11.560 --> 55:13.119
Whatever happens...

55:16.640 --> 55:18.551
I'll never stop loving you.

55:38.200 --> 55:40.669
Get him up. On his feet.

55:55.080 --> 55:56.434
Talk.

55:57.480 --> 55:59.118
Tell me who it was.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.277
Does the prince know you're my here,
my lady?

56:11.600 --> 56:13.352
May the gods forgive me.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.311
MUFFLED SCREAMS

56:42.800 --> 56:44.234
I wasn't sure you'd come.

56:53.720 --> 56:55.154
Go to the Greeks.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.432
Speak to my husband.

57:02.440 --> 57:04.317
Tell him I'm willing to return.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.478
To him and my daughter.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.398
I have one condition.

57:16.440 --> 57:18.875
No one else in the city is to be harmed.

57:18.920 --> 57:20.911
Not Alexander. No one.

57:21.520 --> 57:22.635
Tell him.

57:25.360 --> 57:26.555
Wait.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.829
Will they agree?

57:33.440 --> 57:35.192
We only ever came for you.
