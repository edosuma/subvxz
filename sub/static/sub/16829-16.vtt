WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:05.371
(snoring)

00:05.373 --> 00:06.772
How long as he been like this?

00:06.774 --> 00:09.241
Found him when we came in.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.709
<i> "How to Get Your Point Across</i>
<i> in 30 Seconds Or Less."</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:14.313
Well, guess he was up all night
prepping for that debate.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.515
He's pushing himself so hard.

00:16.517 --> 00:17.583
I feel like it's my fault.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.051
It is.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.552
Why don't you get Patel
to quit so that Sly

00:20.554 --> 00:21.720
can win alderman by default?

00:21.722 --> 00:23.288
Oh, you don't know my boss.

00:23.290 --> 00:26.191
Patel is as competitive
as they come.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.628
I'll tell Mr. Weiner!

00:29.630 --> 00:31.230
I don't want to know
what he was dreaming about.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.164
Sly, you okay?

00:32.166 --> 00:34.033
Uh, no, I-I was dreaming

00:34.035 --> 00:36.301
that it was the debate,
but jocks from my middle school

00:36.303 --> 00:37.636
were snapping
their towels at me.

00:37.638 --> 00:39.772
I hate to ask, but Mr. Weiner?

00:39.774 --> 00:41.040
My middle school gym teacher.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.174
Thank God.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.307
CABE: Sly, you got
to pull it together there

00:43.310 --> 00:44.376
or this debate

00:44.378 --> 00:45.544
is gonna be a bloodbath.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.712
He's not kidding.

00:46.714 --> 00:49.348
If Patel senses weakness,
he will pounce.

00:49.350 --> 00:52.618
Oh, speaking of which, if I'm
late for work he'll pounce, too.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.054
Thanks for breakfast.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.322
Sylvester, good luck.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.290
(yawns)

00:59.260 --> 01:00.459
TOBY:
All right.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.094
Let's wake you up,
get some tea in you.

01:02.096 --> 01:05.297
In my dream, my boxers
were made of pimento loaf.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.265
What does that mean?

01:06.267 --> 01:07.566
That you're messed up.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.471
Pimento loaf.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.839
Morning!

01:13.841 --> 01:15.474
Post-lunch dessert's on us.

01:15.476 --> 01:18.377
Froyo-Ma? Walt was banned
from that place.

01:18.379 --> 01:20.412
Not anymore, thanks to Paige.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.548
She explained to me
how the clerk interpreted

01:22.550 --> 01:25.350
his one loyalty-card punch
per purchase policy,

01:25.352 --> 01:26.852
and despite him
being completely wrong...

01:26.854 --> 01:28.187
Uh-tut-tut...

01:28.189 --> 01:30.222
...I-I accepted

01:30.224 --> 01:32.224
that reasonable people
could disagree,

01:32.226 --> 01:35.360
so I apologized to
him for my behavior,

01:35.362 --> 01:36.428
because saying sorry
is not a sign of weakness,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.464
it is a sign of strength.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.499
Walter apologizing
is a sign of the apocalypse.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.501
But i-if it means
we get to eat froyo...

01:42.503 --> 01:44.236
Uh-uh. For after lunch.

01:48.776 --> 01:51.243
I got to stop leaving him
with you people.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.544
I'm helping with his
President's Day assignment.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.214
Getting him ready to cross
the Delaware, so to speak.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.116
And we got to get ready
to cross the Valley.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.318
We got a photo op
at the Encino Petting Zoo.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.353
Petting zoo?
Lots of kids.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.454
Kids love comics.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.123
You go in there
and talk about keeping

02:04.125 --> 02:05.357
the Warlock's Chest open,

02:05.359 --> 02:06.758
parents like you,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.193
you get votes.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.361
I'm not going to
a petting zoo,

02:09.363 --> 02:10.796
they have chickens.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.600
And...?

02:14.602 --> 02:16.602
And when I was in sixth grade,

02:16.604 --> 02:20.239
we went to a petting zoo,
and the same jocks from my dream

02:20.241 --> 02:22.341
locked me in
the chicken pen.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.443
Beaks, talons, they're covered
in their own fecal matter;

02:24.445 --> 02:26.028
it was terrifying.

02:26.029 --> 02:27.612
I can still hear
Bucky Hanson laughing.

02:27.615 --> 02:31.183
"Here is Sylvester, a
chicken afraid of chickens!"

02:31.185 --> 02:32.718
WALTER:
Fear is irrational.

02:32.719 --> 02:34.252
You're gonna scare yourself
out of this election.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.272
You're scared of snakes.

02:36.273 --> 02:38.290
I was scared of snakes, until I
reevaluated my position on them,

02:38.292 --> 02:41.293
from a rational point of view,
and now my phobia is no more.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.529
Self-improvement
is my new passion.

02:44.665 --> 02:45.931
Speaking of which, I'm gonna...

02:45.933 --> 02:47.766
I'm gonna call that waitress up
from Kovelsky's

02:47.768 --> 02:50.802
who kept on pronouncing gyro
as "jyro,"

02:50.804 --> 02:53.238
and apologize.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.540
You've created a monster.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.241
I'm gonna reread
the Lincoln/Douglas debates.

02:56.243 --> 02:58.343
We're not done talking
about the petting zoo.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.511
Got you mocha.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.579
Does that work
for you?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.681
Oh, I can't even
think about food.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.416
I'm chock full of chia seeds.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.584
I accidentally
ordered a fauxmelet,

03:05.586 --> 03:08.487
a tofu omelet with chia seeds.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.390
It was like somebody hocked up
a loogie on my plate.

03:11.392 --> 03:14.459
How did you accidentally order
an omelet?

03:14.461 --> 03:17.362
I don't want Allie to see me
wearing my reading glasses.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.797
Why not?
You look cute in your glasses.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.866
Grandpas look cute
in their glasses.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.869
I'm a Marine, damn it.
It's just that...

03:23.871 --> 03:25.904
She's 15 years younger than me.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.306
Really?

03:27.308 --> 03:29.308
See? We're like
one of those sitcom couples

03:29.310 --> 03:31.376
where the woman's
too good-looking for the guy.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.478
I don't want to be Ralph Kramden
to her Alice.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.714
I don't get the reference.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.283
God, I'm a dinosaur.

03:38.285 --> 03:39.351
Stop it.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.453
You're a darn
good-looking man

03:41.455 --> 03:43.255
with a ton to offer.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.357
Best tires have some
wear on them, right?

03:45.359 --> 03:47.693
No. People prefer new tires.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.962
(phone ringing)

03:52.833 --> 03:53.999
Cabe Gallo.

03:54.001 --> 03:55.534
(whispering):
Saved by the bell.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.472
(gasps)
Oh, God.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.573
You startled me.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.808
I wanted to thank you
for the yogurt.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.376
Also, I wanted to add...

04:04.378 --> 04:05.828
I know exactly
what you're gonna say:

04:05.829 --> 04:07.279
"You and Walter have been
spending lots of time together

04:07.281 --> 04:08.413
and does that mean you're more
than just friends?"

04:08.415 --> 04:09.448
Answer: We're not.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.483
Actually, I wanted to say

04:11.485 --> 04:13.318
that I think you're doing
a terrific job.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.554
Getting 197 to apologize?

04:15.556 --> 04:17.556
That is amazing work.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.925
Thank you.
<i> De nada.</i>

04:19.927 --> 04:22.294
Now if you just hand over
one of those froyos...

04:22.296 --> 04:24.296
Not till after lunch.

04:24.298 --> 04:27.299
CABE:
Gather up, brainiacs,
we got a case!

04:27.301 --> 04:30.569
The Granse World
Seed Vault in Greenland,

04:30.571 --> 04:33.572
built after the success of the
Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

04:33.574 --> 04:34.973
It's an international
cooperative

04:34.975 --> 04:37.442
of over thousands of
varieties of every crop

04:37.444 --> 04:40.946
and plant you can imagine
from over a hundred countries.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.282
It protects crop diversity
against catastrophes

04:43.284 --> 04:45.751
like the great famine that
killed over a million Irish.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.387
It ensures
the world has backup seeds

04:48.389 --> 04:49.955
in case disease, parasites

04:49.957 --> 04:52.591
or climate change destroys
agricultural output.

04:52.593 --> 04:56.061
It also safeguards against
warfare-caused starvation.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.764
But cooler than what's in
the vault is the facility.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.332
Unmanned 360 days
a year,

05:00.334 --> 05:03.635
it is a doomsday structure
built into a mountainside.

05:03.637 --> 05:06.905
Has its own generators
and computerized sensors

05:06.907 --> 05:09.041
to control motion,
temperature, humidity.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.342
And that's the problem.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.810
The whole system's
malfunctioned.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.513
The vault's heat and humidity
have skyrocketed.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.082
So the world's backup
food supply is in jeopardy.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.051
CABE:
Exactly.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.019
The World Seed Trust
that monitors the vault

05:21.021 --> 05:23.055
has been trying to
fix things remotely

05:23.057 --> 05:25.357
from their control
center over in Finland,

05:25.359 --> 05:28.627
but they can't navigate
the multinational sourced code.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.595
So let me guess,
Scorpion does Greenland?

05:30.597 --> 05:32.597
Uncle Sam has a jet on standby.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.632
SYLVESTER:
Ha!

05:34.702 --> 05:37.369
It looks like
I'll miss the debate.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.370
No, we'll be back in time.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.189
And get your head on right;

05:40.190 --> 05:42.007
I need you focused on work,
not the debate.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.544
PAIGE:
He's just nervous.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.445
I'll keep an eye on him.

05:46.447 --> 05:47.612
TOBY:
Well, if this facility

05:47.614 --> 05:49.548
is as autonomous
as Happy says it is,

05:49.550 --> 05:51.616
you, you're not gonna need
a behaviorist.

05:51.618 --> 05:52.884
So how about
I man the fort

05:52.886 --> 05:53.952
and I'll help Ralph
finish his project.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.520
PAIGE:
Translation:

05:55.522 --> 05:58.557
you stay toasty
while we freeze our tails off.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.658
TOBY:
Well,

05:59.660 --> 06:00.859
if the snow-shoe fits...

06:00.861 --> 06:02.728
Don't forget to pack
your long johns.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.566
(wind gusting)

06:12.473 --> 06:13.972
SYLVESTER: Well, now we know
why nobody ever comes out here.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.107
We're in the middle of nowhere.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.477
Oh, guys.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.512
The card the feds gave us
doesn't work.

06:20.514 --> 06:22.547
Lights off, power's out.

06:22.549 --> 06:23.732
When the computer system
went haywire,

06:23.733 --> 06:24.916
it must've drained
the generator.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.585
I can use the battery
from the snowcat

06:26.587 --> 06:29.654
to give the genny a jump,
once we open the doors.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.490
There's a tangle
of jumper cables in the back.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.492
Hey. Listen.

06:33.494 --> 06:36.862
You keep your eyes focused only
on the snowcat, or otherwise...

06:36.864 --> 06:39.464
You don't need to warn me about
getting lost in a blizzard.

06:39.466 --> 06:40.599
Been there, done that.

06:43.404 --> 06:46.138
Okay. So how do we get through
electronic doors without power?

06:46.140 --> 06:47.572
We can brute force our way in.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.776
We just need to use
Happy's pry bar.

06:50.778 --> 06:51.743
(metal clinks)

06:51.745 --> 06:52.911
(creaking)

06:52.913 --> 06:54.513
(grunting)

06:57.418 --> 06:58.517
Open Sesame.

06:58.519 --> 07:01.186
Got the battery,
let's light this fuse.

07:08.595 --> 07:11.430
Well, this isn't spooky at all.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.566
CABE:
What's with all the handcarts?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.835
Inventory management robots.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.937
They move those boxes
of seeds about the vault

07:18.939 --> 07:20.772
even when no one is here.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.441
Even more creepy.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.009
Generator should be down here
somewhere.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.777
WALTER (over radio):
We'll still have a few things

07:25.779 --> 07:27.145
to clean up once you find it.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.448
I've just tapped
into the vault's diagnostics,

07:29.450 --> 07:32.517
and an electrical surge
must've knocked out a fuse

07:32.519 --> 07:34.753
in the east wing breakroom.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.656
We won't be able to get full
power back up until it's fixed.

07:37.658 --> 07:39.057
We found the generator.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.526
You were right
about the power surge.

07:42.496 --> 07:44.896
And the generator's also fried.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.933
I can get minimal emergency
backup power on,

07:47.935 --> 07:51.036
but that's all we'll have
until I repair it.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.238
Might take a bit.
I'll go find the breakroom.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.773
I may not
be a genius,

07:54.775 --> 07:56.241
but I can flip a breaker switch.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.877
And I'll find the server room
to see what caused

07:58.879 --> 08:01.046
the surge in the
first place.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.681
But since it seems
you're almost done...

08:02.683 --> 08:05.050
You don't want to wander
the dark tunnels alone?

08:05.052 --> 08:06.117
I'd prefer not to.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.652
Well, then...

08:07.654 --> 08:09.120
let there be light.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.789
(clicks, whirring)

08:10.791 --> 08:13.024
(beeping)

08:15.596 --> 08:17.562
Cooling system just kicked in.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.730
Things should cool down now.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.565
(coughing)

08:23.804 --> 08:26.071
So much for this being
an antiseptic facility.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.173
Well, this facility
self-purifies its air,

08:28.175 --> 08:31.142
but the system's been down
for days, so the seeds

08:31.144 --> 08:34.079
have decayed a bit, the vents
are just stirring up seed dust.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.298
Speaking of stirring up,
I can only imagine

08:36.299 --> 08:38.516
what kind of trouble is being
stirred up in the garage.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.552
I worry about
his maturity level.

08:40.554 --> 08:43.088
Don't. Ralph's very responsible.

08:43.090 --> 08:44.289
I was talking about Toby.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.924
Charge!

08:45.925 --> 08:47.558
All right, now,
channel your inner G.W.

08:47.561 --> 08:48.894
and send your troops over.

08:48.896 --> 08:51.263
For one, there were no pirates
on the Delaware.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.698
What Washington did
was illogical.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.166
They were outnumbered,

08:55.168 --> 08:56.301
terrible weather...

08:56.303 --> 08:58.003
That's exactly why he did it.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.704
He needed a bold move
that no one saw coming,

08:59.706 --> 09:02.874
and he faced his fear, he took
action and he was victorious.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.643
Like Walter beat
his fear of snakes?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.745
Maybe, I don't know. What...

09:08.682 --> 09:10.849
Why is that important to you?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.985
I know he likes my mom.

09:13.987 --> 09:16.688
And the logical thing
is to ask her out.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.624
And the most common thing
to beat logic is fear,

09:19.626 --> 09:22.561
so I figured he never asked her
out 'cause he was scared.

09:22.563 --> 09:23.728
And you thought
if he conquered snakes,

09:23.730 --> 09:25.897
he could conquer all fears.

09:27.301 --> 09:31.336
Listen, it's... it is true
that fear can beat logic,

09:31.338 --> 09:34.873
but... logic can also beat fear,

09:34.875 --> 09:38.710
and, uh, I think both
your mom and Walter realized

09:38.712 --> 09:39.611
that the most logical thing
for them

09:39.613 --> 09:41.179
is just to be good friends.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.618
I know. I get it. You, you want
Walter and your mom

09:46.620 --> 09:48.720
to be more
than just friends, but...

09:48.722 --> 09:51.623
Ralph, I don't think
it's gonna happen.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.594
Look, I'm-I'm not trying
to poop on your parade here.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.629
No. I, I get it.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.665
Hey. Let's, um...

10:00.667 --> 10:02.267
let's turn that frown
upside down.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.102
You want to, uh, eat
everyone else's else's froyo?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.904
Yeah.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.908
Walter, I think I know
what started the surge.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.042
Time.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.243
Please clarify.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.712
SYLVESTER:
The server's operating system

10:13.714 --> 10:15.614
is off by 51 seconds.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.382
That's a second a day
since one second was added

10:17.384 --> 10:20.051
to the Atomic world clock
on January 1.

10:20.053 --> 10:22.654
But the programmers forgot
to account for the extra second,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.322
so the vault's operating
system has been trying

10:24.324 --> 10:27.058
to reconcile that with the
control room in Finland,

10:27.060 --> 10:28.727
which has the correct time.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.796
So, the facility's processor
worked faster and faster,

10:31.798 --> 10:34.799
never able to catch up,
creating an electrical surge

10:34.801 --> 10:38.370
that fried the generator
and blew a fuse.

10:38.372 --> 10:40.506
So the whole place went dark

10:40.507 --> 10:42.641
because the programmers forgot
to synchronize their watches?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.075
SYLVESTER:
Right! But if I can get

10:44.077 --> 10:46.044
the operating system's clock
lined up with Finland's,

10:46.046 --> 10:47.712
then I'll have this fixed.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.914
(soft clatter)

10:52.786 --> 10:54.352
Is anyone else getting
a weird vibe?

10:54.354 --> 10:56.688
Like...

10:56.690 --> 10:57.973
like we're not alone?

10:57.974 --> 10:59.257
CABE:
You're just scared of the dark.

10:59.259 --> 11:02.427
Suck it up and get cracking,
'cause I just found the fuse box

11:02.429 --> 11:06.831
and I want us back to L.A. ASAP
so we can do some debate prep.

11:06.833 --> 11:10.669
Okay, it just feels like
there's eyes on me.

11:10.671 --> 11:11.670
PAIGE:
Sly,

11:11.672 --> 11:13.338
just know everything's fine.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.707
Listen to my calm voice,
fix the server's clock

11:15.709 --> 11:17.742
and we'll be out of here soon.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.310
You're right.

11:19.312 --> 11:22.447
I'm rebooting the system now
to correct the time.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.815
Should take 40 minutes.

11:27.754 --> 11:28.853
Ah!

11:32.693 --> 11:34.192
HAPPY:
Guys?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.827
Did blast doors
lock you in, too?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.829
Yeah, I'm locked in, too.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.897
SYLVESTER:
Me, too.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.465
And I'm kind of freaking out!

11:40.467 --> 11:42.033
Relax.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.968
The vault prioritizes
keeping seeds safe

11:43.970 --> 11:46.771
so it must go into lockdown
when it's most vulnerable,

11:46.773 --> 11:49.241
i.e. a reboot.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.710
So the doors will open in 40
minutes when the reboot is done.

11:51.712 --> 11:52.477
Everything is fine.

11:52.479 --> 11:54.946
No.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.415
No, everything is not fine.

11:57.417 --> 11:58.416
(skittering in distance)

11:58.418 --> 11:59.818
Walter!

11:59.820 --> 12:00.885
Help!

12:00.887 --> 12:02.821
They're in here.
They're in here!

12:02.823 --> 12:04.355
(screams)

12:04.357 --> 12:06.424
♪ ♪

12:14.234 --> 12:16.234
(Sylvester screams over radio)
WALTER: Sylvester, do you copy?

12:16.235 --> 12:18.235
What the hell's in there with
him? Get him out of there.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.055
I can't. With the emergency
power back on,

12:20.056 --> 12:21.873
the magnetic field is engaged,
I can't just force my way in.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.141
These doors are sealed tight

12:23.143 --> 12:24.743
until the reboot's
done in 40 minutes.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.778
Listen to him,
he doesn't have 40 minutes!

12:26.780 --> 12:28.413
Then the only way these doors
can go up is if Sly

12:28.415 --> 12:30.782
manually disengages the locks

12:30.783 --> 12:33.150
from the command console and we
get full power up and running.
SYLVESTER: Get me out of here!

12:33.153 --> 12:35.286
To do that you need to
repair that generator

12:35.288 --> 12:37.388
and then Cabe needs
to fix the breaker.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.890
Easier said than done.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.258
Damn thing's stuck tight.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.893
I've never heard Sly
like this before.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.228
We have to help him.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.263
Okay, I'm gonna get
the closed circuit TV on now

12:45.265 --> 12:46.397
so we can see him.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.832
Hold on, hold on.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.234
He's quiet now. Sly?

12:49.236 --> 12:51.302
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

12:51.304 --> 12:53.772
I'm here.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.040
I was right, I am not alone.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.942
What's going on?
Who's in there with you?

12:57.944 --> 13:00.945
Not "who"...

13:00.947 --> 13:02.180
but "what."

13:03.250 --> 13:06.317
It's chickens!

13:06.319 --> 13:07.952
H-How did chickens
get in?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.354
No, they didn't.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.991
Sylvester,
how many chickens?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.262
About 20 or so.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.997
I'm in their coop.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.198
He's cracked.
What's wrong with him?

13:20.200 --> 13:23.368
I have no idea,
but I know who to ask.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.504
Chickens?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.339
Well, to steal Happy's line,
not good.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.875
I am sending you
the security feed now

13:30.877 --> 13:32.477
and linking your phone
to our comms.

13:34.181 --> 13:39.050
Okay, well, those are
bona fide fear responses.

13:39.052 --> 13:42.387
Sly, pal, I'm watching you on
the monitors right now,

13:42.389 --> 13:44.289
and there are no chickens
in there with you.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.057
They are all over!

13:46.059 --> 13:48.293
The cameras must be broken
or something!

13:48.295 --> 13:50.829
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,

13:50.831 --> 13:53.998
I, uh, I see 'em now, Sly.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.967
Hey, um, Paige?

13:55.969 --> 13:58.203
Uh, call me back on
my cell right now

13:58.205 --> 13:59.437
and conference in
Happy and Cabe.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.372
What's wrong with Sylvester?

14:01.374 --> 14:04.209
(phone ringing)
I don't know, buddy, but
whatever it is, it's serious.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.543
TOBY:
Hey, guys.

14:05.545 --> 14:07.212
I didn't want Sly to hear us.
Why?

14:07.214 --> 14:08.446
What are we hiding from him?

14:08.448 --> 14:10.515
The fact that he's in
the midst of a complete

14:10.517 --> 14:11.983
psychotic break from reality.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.451
Now, telling him
he's imagining those chickens

14:13.453 --> 14:15.286
will just agitate him
and make things worse.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.387
How did that happen?

14:16.389 --> 14:18.356
It could be anything
from bacteria

14:18.358 --> 14:20.625
in something you guys ate on
the flight to a brain tumor.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.294
Now, let's first make sure
you guys are okay.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.429
Do you feel any headaches,

14:24.431 --> 14:26.898
or dizziness, or ocular flashes?

14:26.900 --> 14:28.600
I'm fine.
No symptoms.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.301
Nothing, I'm good.

14:30.303 --> 14:34.272
No complaints here, except
my arthritis is acting up.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.008
You don't have arthritis, Cabe.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.277
Tell that to my hand, I've been
trying to flip this breaker

14:39.279 --> 14:40.578
and it won't budge.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.480
Joints are killing me.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.615
Again, they shouldn't be,

14:43.617 --> 14:45.049
because you don't have
arthritis.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.951
Hey, Happy, what is that

14:46.953 --> 14:48.553
yellow powder on your tool bag?

14:48.555 --> 14:50.321
HAPPY:
Seed dust.

14:50.323 --> 14:53.091
Okay, now,
this-this could be an issue.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.092
What kind of seeds?

14:54.094 --> 14:56.261
Rye. Why is that important?

14:56.263 --> 14:57.295
Because that is not seed dust,

14:57.297 --> 14:58.630
that's seed fungus!

14:58.632 --> 15:00.265
<i> Claviceps purpurea,</i>

15:00.267 --> 15:02.000
commonly known as ergot.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.302
Now, when the humidity
increased in the vault,

15:04.304 --> 15:05.904
ergot spores were formed.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.105
The vent turning on

15:07.107 --> 15:09.340
spread the fungus.
Who breathed it in?

15:09.342 --> 15:11.609
Walt and I are locked out
in the entrance, no vents here.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.378
So only Sly,
Happy and Cabe.

15:13.380 --> 15:14.379
Why?

15:14.381 --> 15:15.613
What does it do to you?

15:15.615 --> 15:17.081
TOBY:
Its neurotropic traits

15:17.083 --> 15:20.151
cause hallucinations,
specifically affecting

15:20.153 --> 15:22.687
the fear center in the brain.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.222
In short, Cabe, Sly, and Happy
are going to experience

15:25.225 --> 15:26.457
their deepest fears.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.393
We're gonna do what?

15:28.395 --> 15:31.362
Cabe Gallo does not hallucinate.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.164
Okay, so they have
a living nightmare

15:33.166 --> 15:34.599
and after a while
they wake up?

15:34.601 --> 15:37.969
No, no, they are not nightmares,
they are false realities.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.338
And they're so genuine that
people take dangerous actions

15:40.340 --> 15:41.840
to end them.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.341
In doing so,
they could hurt themselves

15:43.343 --> 15:45.109
or others. Hey, Happy?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.794
Listen to me.

15:46.795 --> 15:48.478
Anything you might be starting
to feel is not real.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.480
It's all in your head.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.448
Sorry, I got to go.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.983
The bell just rang.

15:51.985 --> 15:54.686
What-What bell? No, no, no,
there's no bell. Happy?

15:54.688 --> 15:57.121
<i> Happy, there's no bell.</i>
(bell ringing)

16:01.027 --> 16:03.394
(door opens)

16:03.396 --> 16:05.630
Good afternoon, children.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.500
HAPPY AND CHILDREN:
Good afternoon, Ms. Weldy.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.170
So today, we have visitors.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.405
Prospective parents
who are looking for

16:14.407 --> 16:18.576
that very special child
to help them form a family.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.413
So, best behavior.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.582
They will be watching.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.684
And that means

16:26.686 --> 16:29.420
no wrenches, no ratchets.

16:34.561 --> 16:38.429
A proper toy for a proper lady.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.436
I'll be better this time,
Ms. Weldy.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.539
Who the hell's Ms. Weldy?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.541
PAIGE:
Why does it matter?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.143
Because if we're gonna
talk these guys down,

16:52.145 --> 16:53.478
I need to know what
psychological baggage

16:53.480 --> 16:55.380
the fungus is unpacking.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.281
I'll hack public databases,
see if I can find a Ms. Weldy

16:57.283 --> 16:58.416
connected to Happy in some way.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.417
No, no ,no, no.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.252
She's my fiancée. I'll do it.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.687
You can't, your hands
are too full.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.555
Look at Cabe.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.557
TOBY:
No, Cabe!

17:06.559 --> 17:08.526
Don't go full zombie on me, man!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.561
Cabe, can you hear me?

17:10.563 --> 17:12.296
ALLIE: Arthritis
acting up again, honey?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.299
Huh?

17:15.301 --> 17:17.368
Yeah.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.369
It's killing me.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.138
Still working the fuse box?

17:20.140 --> 17:21.606
Yeah, I'm having
trouble with it.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.508
That's 'cause you were
alive for so long

17:23.510 --> 17:25.410
before electricity was invented.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.278
It's still new to you.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.814
(canned laughter)

17:32.485 --> 17:34.318
What kind of
casserole is that?

17:34.320 --> 17:37.655
Kale, flaxseed,
macrobiotic grains.

17:38.425 --> 17:39.524
(canned laughter)

17:39.526 --> 17:41.359
What should I expect
from a man whose

17:41.361 --> 17:43.461
social security number is one?

17:43.463 --> 17:44.462
(canned laughter)

17:44.464 --> 17:46.798
I'm not hungry.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.233
Let's curl up on the couch
and watch a movie.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.302
We could watch<i> Jurassic Park.</i>

17:51.304 --> 17:53.504
Might bring back
some memories for you.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.440
(canned laughter)

17:55.442 --> 17:56.641
But no movie for me.

17:58.611 --> 18:02.280
A new club opened up
and I'm going dancing.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.749
(canned laughter)

18:04.751 --> 18:07.118
You wouldn't want to come,
would you?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.786
Me, dancing?

18:08.788 --> 18:09.787
No.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.322
I-I-I can't...

18:11.324 --> 18:13.458
I can't go dancing.

18:14.461 --> 18:17.595
On account of my arthritis.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.664
(canned "Aw!")

18:22.168 --> 18:23.468
WALTER:
Cabe's brain's gone.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.603
He's talking about
dancing and arthritis.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.737
He's gonna wish the only thing

18:26.739 --> 18:28.573
he has to worry about
is arthritis.

18:28.575 --> 18:31.776
Sly's symptoms started first,
so I'm keeping an eye on him

18:31.778 --> 18:33.644
and he's getting a little
unsure of foot.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.263
What does that mean?

18:35.264 --> 18:36.881
TOBY: It means they're in
trouble and we're on the clock.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.117
Look, if ergot exposure
was extensive--

18:39.119 --> 18:41.136
and now it appears it was--

18:41.137 --> 18:43.154
it constricts blood vessels,
especially in the brain.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.490
If vessels are constricted,
it means less blood flow;

18:45.492 --> 18:47.592
less blood flow means less
oxygen; less oxygen means...

18:47.594 --> 18:49.461
WALTER:
Coma.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.329
You think they could all
fall into a coma and die?

18:51.331 --> 18:53.498
No, I am saying they<i> will</i> fall
into a coma and die

18:53.500 --> 18:55.700
in the next 30 minutes if we
don't get them out of there.

19:00.807 --> 19:03.274
TOBY: As we speak, they are
all still inhaling fungus

19:03.276 --> 19:06.777
because I am sure that vent
sent out microscopic molecules

19:06.779 --> 19:07.812
all over the place.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.514
So we have to move fast

19:09.516 --> 19:11.315
before exposure
reaches critical mass.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.351
The only way to open
the doors is if Sly uses

19:13.353 --> 19:15.353
the manual override from
the command console,

19:15.355 --> 19:17.421
Happy fixes the generator
and Cabe repairs the fuse.

19:17.423 --> 19:18.656
And none of them can do that

19:18.658 --> 19:20.158
when they're out of their minds.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.659
So we put them into their minds.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.828
We talk 'em lucid so they
can finish their tasks.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.631
Okay ,um, I'll take Happy
'cause I know her best.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.599
Cabe trusts Walter.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.768
And Paige is left with Sly.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.837
From what I can see, you got
your work cut out for you.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.739
(groans)
Hey, hey, hey.

19:34.741 --> 19:36.541
Get away from me,
you foul fowl.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.393
PAIGE:
Oh, boy.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.244
Sly, you need to move across
the room to the command console.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.180
You need to
pull the door release.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.314
Back away, hens.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.949
I will deep-fry the lot of you.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.351
PAIGE: Sly, if you don't listen
to my instructions

19:47.353 --> 19:48.653
you are going to die.

19:48.655 --> 19:49.754
Avian flu.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.589
Encephalitis virus.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.558
(groans)
Salmonella.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.359
Poop.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.661
Poop everywhere.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.197
PAIGE:
Sly, don't go under that desk.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.732
I will be safe under here.
Sly, I said

20:01.734 --> 20:02.700
don't go under that desk!
(Sly laughs)

20:02.702 --> 20:04.802
Now I am protected.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.337
PAIGE:
Sly, just pull the lever!

20:06.339 --> 20:07.805
SYLVESTER:
They can't to get me in here.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.740
I am never leaving this spot.

20:09.742 --> 20:10.975
PAIGE:
How do I get Sly

20:10.977 --> 20:12.743
to pull a lever if
he can't even hear me?

20:12.745 --> 20:13.828
I'm having the same
problem with Cabe.

20:13.829 --> 20:14.912
He's in a complete
other world.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.714
Cabe? Respond to your name.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.782
(echoing):
<i> Cabe Gallo?</i>

20:17.784 --> 20:18.816
<i> Cabe Gallo.</i>

20:18.818 --> 20:20.751
ANNOUNCER:
Cabe Gallo!

20:20.753 --> 20:21.852
Welcome to the show.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.388
It is time to play...

20:24.390 --> 20:27.592
RAY AND AUDIENCE:
Older than dirt!

20:27.594 --> 20:28.759
(applause)
Whoo!

20:28.761 --> 20:30.328
(Ray laughs)

20:30.330 --> 20:32.430
Today's contestant
is so old,

20:32.432 --> 20:33.998
he got a special thanks
in the Bible.
(audience laughing)

20:34.000 --> 20:36.767
His birthday candles
caused global warming.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.704
And if he were to act his age,
well, he'd drop dead right here.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.872
Say hello to Cabe Gallo!

20:41.874 --> 20:43.574
Don't I know you?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.610
I don't know. Do you?

20:45.612 --> 20:46.911
It's your hallucination,
brother.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.946
Let's play, shall we?
First question:

20:48.948 --> 20:51.882
which of the following things
would Allie be shocked to learn

20:51.884 --> 20:54.452
didn't exist when Cabe was born?

20:54.454 --> 20:56.721
(countdown music playing)
Was it manned
spaced travel,

20:56.723 --> 20:57.722
portable calculators,

20:57.724 --> 20:59.523
or tape cassettes?

20:59.525 --> 21:01.892
(grandfather clock chimes)

21:01.894 --> 21:03.894
I don't want to play this game.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.563
(buzzer sounds)
Oh, so close.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.365
The answer is
all of these.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.699
All of these things
didn't exist

21:08.701 --> 21:10.501
when Cabe was born
a full decade and a half

21:10.503 --> 21:11.869
before his current girlfriend.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.372
(bell chimes)
Allie likes me
just the way I am.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.707
All shriveled?
Don't think so.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.009
(studio audience laughter)
(Ray laughs)

21:18.011 --> 21:19.810
RAY:
Next question.

21:19.812 --> 21:22.747
What grade was Allie in when
you married your first wife?

21:22.749 --> 21:24.815
I don't want to play this game.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.350
Well, nobody does,

21:26.352 --> 21:27.918
but we all have to
play it eventually,

21:27.920 --> 21:31.489
even badass,
ex-football-playing Marines.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.357
WALTER:
Cabe. Cabe, what are you doing?

21:33.359 --> 21:35.459
Toby, he's-he's hunched over.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.528
I think he has an invisible cane
or a walking stick.

21:37.530 --> 21:38.796
He's moving like he's a hundred.

21:38.798 --> 21:40.431
All right, can't
help right now.

21:40.433 --> 21:42.433
I'm trying to figure out
who Ms. Weldy is

21:42.435 --> 21:43.768
because Happy's
talking to her

21:43.770 --> 21:45.436
and I have no idea
what this all means.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.538
Wonderful news, children.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.307
So many of you

21:49.309 --> 21:50.808
have found your forever homes.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.943
When I read out your names,

21:52.945 --> 21:56.480
you can go and meet
your new mothers and fathers.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.948
Michael.

21:58.918 --> 22:00.351
Sean,

22:00.353 --> 22:02.053
Jamal,

22:02.055 --> 22:05.523
Theo, Antoine,

22:05.525 --> 22:07.425
Isabelle,

22:07.427 --> 22:08.759
Roseanne,

22:08.761 --> 22:10.995
Ronin,

22:10.997 --> 22:12.630
Janine,

22:12.632 --> 22:16.367
Abigail, Owen,

22:16.369 --> 22:18.102
Kanti,

22:18.104 --> 22:20.571
and Steven.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.111
Could you check your list again?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.648
I'm so sorry, darling.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.116
Maybe next time.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.118
I can be normal. I promise.

22:35.822 --> 22:40.825
Well, there is one last shot,

22:40.827 --> 22:43.561
but I'm not sure it'll work.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.564
Could we try, please?

22:46.566 --> 22:48.833
Maybe the next one will like me.

22:48.835 --> 22:52.903
Okay. I'll return in a moment.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.879
RALPH:
I found her.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.880
Mavis Weldy ran the Canoga Park
Home for Children 20 years ago.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.850
Oh, my God.
She's reliving every time

23:05.852 --> 23:07.685
she was rejected for adoption.

23:07.687 --> 23:11.021
That is Happy's darkest fear:
being rejected, being alone.

23:11.023 --> 23:12.990
(door opens)

23:12.992 --> 23:15.960
Happy Quinn,
this is Dr. Curtis.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.828
Hello.

23:17.830 --> 23:18.829
I'm Happy.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.531
Are you?

23:20.533 --> 23:21.999
I'm a doctor
of psychiatric medicine.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.734
I can tell right away
you're not happy.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.136
I'm just nervous, Doc.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.972
Doc?!
Oh, crap, she's talking to me.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.640
Her biggest fear
isn't being rejected;

23:29.642 --> 23:31.142
it's that I'll reject her, too.

23:31.144 --> 23:34.945
Happy, Happy, hey, listen to me,
I would never do that.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.113
I love you.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.948
I'm not sure about this.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.518
You know, if I commit to her,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.820
I'm stuck with her
for the rest of my life?

23:42.822 --> 23:44.755
There's got to be
something wrong with her

23:44.757 --> 23:45.756
if she's here, right?

23:45.758 --> 23:46.824
HAPPY:
I try hard.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.058
I'm just a little
bit different

23:48.060 --> 23:49.860
from the other kids.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.962
Well, I'm not so sure
this will be the right fit.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.032
No, you promised
to be with me for life.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.500
You proposed to me.

23:56.502 --> 23:57.601
Quick to anger.

23:57.603 --> 23:58.736
Volatile.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.070
I think I'd regret
this decision.

24:00.072 --> 24:01.439
Sorry, I...

24:01.441 --> 24:03.674
I don't want her.

24:03.676 --> 24:06.010
Not for me.

24:06.012 --> 24:07.978
MS. WELDY:
I understand.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.547
I'm so sorry, Happy.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.782
Maybe next time.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.051
But I'm perfect for you.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.926
TOBY:
Oh, no, she's looking tired.

24:21.928 --> 24:25.463
Happy, please do not
close your eyes.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.164
Ralph, if Happy falls asleep
she's history,

24:27.166 --> 24:28.532
and we can't undo it.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.034
But what if we could?

24:30.036 --> 24:32.770
Like you told me earlier.
Logic can beat fear.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.138
So let's be logical.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.973
All fear has
a genesis in history.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.208
If we go back
and undo that moment...

24:37.210 --> 24:39.043
Then their darkest fears
will cease to exist.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.078
They'll be lucid enough
to take the steps needed

24:41.080 --> 24:42.546
to get through
those blast doors.

24:42.548 --> 24:44.014
Um, Walter, Paige.

24:44.016 --> 24:45.015
We have an idea.

24:45.017 --> 24:46.217
I'm all ears 'cause right now

24:46.219 --> 24:47.985
I can't coax Sly out
from under the desk.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.955
You need to go back to the point
when these fears started

24:50.957 --> 24:52.923
and attack that seminal moment.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.092
If a match is never struck,
a fire can never burn.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.660
Sly said that his fear started

24:56.662 --> 24:57.962
with Bucky Hanson
at the petting zoo.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.514
And Cabe started feeling weird

24:59.515 --> 25:01.065
when he wouldn't wear reading
glasses in front of Allie.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.000
You guys go after those
two moments, rewrite history.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.268
Got it, but what about Happy?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.003
She's been alone
since she was a child,

25:06.005 --> 25:08.739
and I'm gonna
put an end to that.

25:08.741 --> 25:11.041
Hi.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.143
TOBY/YOUNG TOBY:
I'm Tobias.

25:13.145 --> 25:14.044
YOUNG TOBY:
I'm new here.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.746
Got anything to eat?

25:23.990 --> 25:25.589
Here.

25:25.591 --> 25:28.058
What's left of my lunch.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.927
I like Evel Knievel.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.863
I want a motorcycle one day.

25:34.000 --> 25:37.067
I thought all the kids
were adopted.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.302
Not me.

25:38.304 --> 25:40.170
Is that why you're sad?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.072
No. I don't care.

25:44.243 --> 25:47.745
Besides, I knew that
nobody would want me

25:47.747 --> 25:49.780
'cause I'm defective.

25:49.782 --> 25:51.782
That's not why
you're still here.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.084
We just exited the '90s.

25:54.086 --> 25:56.220
The Spice Girls
had number one hits.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.188
Half the women in America
are wearing a haircut

25:58.190 --> 25:59.957
called "The Rachel,"
and everyone's investing

25:59.959 --> 26:01.859
in a Web site called,
"Ask Jeeves."

26:01.861 --> 26:04.328
This is a decade where
everyone's making bad decisions,

26:04.330 --> 26:06.330
so anyone who doesn't
want you in their life?

26:06.332 --> 26:08.799
That's just another
bad decision.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.039
Mmm, nice. Tuna fish.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.308
I like your hat.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.010
I like you.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.145
I like you, too.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.880
Will you marry me?

26:22.882 --> 26:26.817
Uh, we just met,
and we're eight.

26:26.819 --> 26:30.888
You know who I am,
and my biggest regret in life

26:30.890 --> 26:35.059
is that we really didn't meet
when we were eight because

26:35.061 --> 26:38.028
I would've fallen in love
with you from that moment.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.598
The truth is
you've never been alone.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.799
My love for you

26:41.801 --> 26:43.901
has always been there.
It just took a while

26:43.903 --> 26:45.970
for our paths to cross
so I could share it with you.

26:45.972 --> 26:48.238
And under all those
neurotoxins in your head,

26:48.240 --> 26:50.107
you know I'm right.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.309
You have nothing
to be scared of, ever.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.119
Doc...

27:02.121 --> 27:04.088
what's going on?

27:04.090 --> 27:05.723
That generator over there?

27:05.725 --> 27:06.824
To save yourself

27:06.826 --> 27:08.125
and your friends,

27:08.127 --> 27:09.760
you have to fix it, fast.

27:09.762 --> 27:11.295
Easy.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.232
Guys, I got through to Happy.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.101
Now you have to take care
of business on your end.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.103
Trying,
but Sly isn't cooperating.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.204
Well, then get tough with him.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.273
Okay, here it goes.

27:23.275 --> 27:25.809
PAIGE: Look at Sylvester,
hiding in a coop...

27:25.811 --> 27:27.211
BUCKY: ...just where
a chicken should be.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.080
Stop teasing me, Bucky.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.948
Come out so I can pluck
your feathers.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.533
Leave me alone.

27:32.534 --> 27:34.117
You should've never locked me
in here with these creatures.

27:34.120 --> 27:36.854
Aw, you want
to go tell the teacher?

27:36.856 --> 27:38.422
Come pull this lever
and go tell them.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.224
PAIGE:
I don't get it.

27:40.226 --> 27:42.326
He's faced a lot worse
than an 11-year-old brat.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.428
Mom, in Sly's mind, he's my age.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.296
He doesn't know
all the brave things he's done.

27:46.298 --> 27:47.231
You have to tell him.

27:47.233 --> 27:48.298
Good point, honey.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.000
Coward. Knew those stories

27:50.002 --> 27:51.268
about you weren't true.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.803
What stories?

27:52.805 --> 27:54.338
That you jumped out of a plane,

27:54.340 --> 27:55.739
captured a poisonous snake,

27:55.741 --> 27:57.274
helped save a boy
from a sinkhole.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.976
Wait, I think
I did do those things.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.912
No, you didn't, you weenie.
Don't dispute the facts.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.415
Facts are my forte;
I never get them wrong.

28:04.417 --> 28:05.816
Really?

28:05.818 --> 28:08.018
Then why is a hero
hiding from chickens?

28:08.020 --> 28:11.689
I think it's time you
reconsider your facts, bucko.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.892
Fact: I leapt off
of a cruise ship.

28:14.894 --> 28:18.696
Fact: I went into a cave
full of bats.

28:18.698 --> 28:22.066
Fact: I punched a man
in the face in prison.

28:24.003 --> 28:29.139
Fact: what you did to me
in sixth grade was mean, but...

28:29.141 --> 28:32.242
I'm not scared
of you anymore

28:32.244 --> 28:33.944
because I'm a man,

28:33.946 --> 28:36.146
and I can be brave sometimes,

28:36.148 --> 28:37.848
you little turd.

28:39.819 --> 28:41.785
And I'm still telling on you.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.353
Come on, Sly, you can do it.

28:47.827 --> 28:48.959
Okay.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.129
(screaming)

28:56.969 --> 28:58.035
Okay.

29:00.740 --> 29:01.872
Great job, Sly.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.108
Time to take a load off.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.109
Toby, Sly pulled the lever,
but he's sleepy.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.210
You said sleepy was bad.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.078
Sleepy is the first
step to coma,

29:08.080 --> 29:09.513
<i> and Happy is starting</i>
<i> to slip, too.</i>

29:09.515 --> 29:12.416
Fighting that fungus
wiped them out.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.952
Walt, all we need now is
for Cabe to fix that breaker,

29:14.954 --> 29:16.920
and we can open the doors
and get them out.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.923
I can't get him to move.
He's just sitting like a statue.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.959
Well, Paige and I have to try
to keep Sly and Happy awake.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.361
Just get him to flip
that damn switch! Do it!

29:24.363 --> 29:26.497
I don't know how to talk someone
out of being scared.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.965
I can't relate
to that kind of emotion.

29:27.967 --> 29:28.999
PAIGE:
Really?

29:29.001 --> 29:30.801
'Cause you seem
pretty scared now.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.369
Your biggest fear
isn't snakes, was it?

29:32.371 --> 29:33.737
It's problems
you can't solve.

29:33.738 --> 29:35.104
Now do what you did
with the yogurt guy,

29:35.107 --> 29:37.975
and put yourself
in Cabe's shoes.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.376
Okay.

29:39.378 --> 29:41.178
Okay, uh, I'm Cabe.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.848
I like steak and Conway Twitty.
I'm scared of getting old. Why?

29:44.850 --> 29:46.550
Because of death?

29:46.552 --> 29:50.020
No, Cabe faces death
all the time, so then why?

29:50.022 --> 29:51.188
Because...

29:52.992 --> 29:54.391
I got it. I got it.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.794
Cabe, listen closely.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.262
You don't fear getting old;

29:58.264 --> 30:00.497
you fear weakness.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.965
I can understand that.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.433
When I can't solve a problem,
I-I feel weak.

30:03.435 --> 30:06.003
I feel powerless.
I feel useless

30:06.005 --> 30:09.139
because my identity
is intellect,

30:09.141 --> 30:10.541
and yours is strength.

30:10.543 --> 30:13.010
You are a military man,
a government agent,

30:13.012 --> 30:16.013
someone who is strong for their
friends, but when you fear

30:16.015 --> 30:19.149
weakness, you feel that
you'll lose your identity

30:19.151 --> 30:23.020
because of it, and the people
that you care about, like Allie.

30:23.022 --> 30:24.321
Is that right?

30:24.323 --> 30:26.023
Cabe?

30:26.025 --> 30:30.027
God? Is that you?

30:30.029 --> 30:34.031
You sound a lot less confident
than I thought you'd be.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.465
That's because
I'm worried about you,

30:35.467 --> 30:38.168
but I shouldn't be because
getting old is not a detriment.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.536
It is a strength.

30:39.538 --> 30:43.207
With age comes
experience, knowledge

30:43.209 --> 30:44.341
and wisdom.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.542
What you've forgotten,

30:45.544 --> 30:47.511
others will never know.

30:47.513 --> 30:49.046
And what you've lived,

30:49.048 --> 30:51.081
others only read about.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.149
What you can do,

30:52.151 --> 30:54.985
others can only dream about.

30:54.987 --> 30:56.253
Cabe Gallo
is stopped by nothing.

30:56.255 --> 30:59.056
Certainly not
by fungus and fear and...

30:59.058 --> 31:00.257
Wait, what are you doing?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.993
I'm gonna flip
that damn breaker switch.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.600
Okay.

31:09.602 --> 31:13.270
I did it, son, but...

31:15.040 --> 31:16.139
WALTER:
Cabe? Cabe!

31:16.141 --> 31:17.207
Guys, he's unconscious.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.408
So are Sly and Happy.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.077
They got it done,
but it's too late.

31:20.079 --> 31:21.945
They're all in comas.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.185
Okay, they're unconscious; let's
just load them onto the snowcat

31:28.187 --> 31:30.287
and take them to the
closest hospital.

31:30.289 --> 31:31.188
TOBY:
I already looked it up,

31:31.190 --> 31:32.856
it's two hours hours away!

31:32.857 --> 31:34.523
They need immediate medical care
or they're never gonna wake up.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.026
You're the doctor
and on another continent.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.527
I-I really don't think
there's a nearby pharmacy

31:37.529 --> 31:39.196
out here in
the tundra.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.597
This whole building
is a pharmacy.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.033
It houses the greatest seed
collection in the world.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.368
We can synthesize a treatment.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.036
I'll hack the vault's database,

31:46.038 --> 31:48.171
find the location
of whatever you need.

31:48.173 --> 31:49.907
Okay, okay. Uh, let me think.

31:49.909 --> 31:52.442
First, we're gonna
need plant seeds

31:52.444 --> 31:54.511
with an antifungal polyenes
to attack the ergot.

31:54.513 --> 31:56.513
Ralph,
look for bachelor's button,

31:56.515 --> 31:58.148
also known as basket flower.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.950
And then, we're
gonna need to mix it

31:59.952 --> 32:02.352
with a highly concentrated
anti-inflammatory

32:02.354 --> 32:04.087
to bust open
the circulatory system

32:04.089 --> 32:06.023
and allow blood to get
back to the brain.

32:06.025 --> 32:09.326
Oh, um, alpha-Linolenic acid
is found in chia seeds.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.694
Tracking it all down now.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.362
Guys, this treatment
needs to be given to them

32:12.364 --> 32:13.931
in the next few minutes

32:13.933 --> 32:15.565
or they're gonna suffer
permanent neurological damage!

32:15.567 --> 32:17.634
Still one problem, we never
planned on going inside.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.303
To get the seeds
and our friends,

32:19.304 --> 32:20.971
we have to go through
ergot-saturated pathways.

32:20.973 --> 32:24.141
We'll wind up whacked-out
like how they were.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.576
Not if we don't breathe in
heavily contaminated air.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.245
The oxygen pipes run

32:28.247 --> 32:30.480
through this facility as part
of its preservation system.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.049
Now, if we tap into this,

32:32.051 --> 32:33.684
then we can inhale fresh air
the whole trip.

32:33.686 --> 32:36.053
Tap into it how?
It's ten feet high.

32:37.056 --> 32:40.057
PVC pipes bracketed to the wall!
Tear it off

32:40.059 --> 32:42.092
while I hack
into the main server

32:42.094 --> 32:44.261
and increase the pressure
in the oxygen pipes.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.997
You mind telling me

32:46.999 --> 32:49.466
why I'm vandalizing
a seed vault?

32:49.468 --> 32:50.968
I'm building up pressure
in the O2 pipes

32:50.970 --> 32:52.970
so small
that fissures crack open.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.404
Pure oxygen will pour out.

32:54.406 --> 32:56.673
And we'll use the PVC

32:56.675 --> 32:58.241
to breathe in untainted oxygen
along our route inside.

32:58.243 --> 32:59.609
TOBY:
That should work,

32:59.611 --> 33:02.346
but you guys will still
get some ergot into your system.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.047
Not enough to go full nutbar,

33:04.049 --> 33:06.083
but if you start seeing
pink elephants,

33:06.085 --> 33:07.250
know that they are not real.

33:07.252 --> 33:09.119
(beeping)
WALTER: Got the PSI to the tilt.

33:09.121 --> 33:12.022
Oxygen conduits should
start cracking... now.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.690
(cracking)

33:13.692 --> 33:15.492
(oxygen hissing)

33:15.494 --> 33:17.127
Great.

33:17.129 --> 33:19.062
All right,
we're going to take a big breath

33:19.064 --> 33:20.697
before we go
through this door.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.135
(panel beeps)

33:28.774 --> 33:30.073
(panel beeps)

33:40.552 --> 33:42.252
(panel beeps)

33:46.492 --> 33:49.126
Oh, my God,
it's freezing in here!

33:49.128 --> 33:50.761
It's the refrigerant system
to store the seeds.

33:50.763 --> 33:53.063
But it should have
just low levels of ergot,

33:53.065 --> 33:55.132
like Toby said, not
like the tunnels.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.034
So if we're in and out
quickly, we should be okay.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.169
Ralph, find us our seeds.

33:59.171 --> 34:01.738
Aisle A, box 1032.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.673
Bachelor's button flower
from Austria.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.176
We got it.

34:06.178 --> 34:09.112
From Guatemala,
aisle C, box 5306.

34:09.114 --> 34:11.214
WALTER:
Yep.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.749
PAIGE:
Found it. Nice work, honey.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.251
TOBY:
Now, you'll need to make

34:14.253 --> 34:16.186
a high oil extraction
from the seeds.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.788
Start by grinding them
into a powder.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.790
Walter,

34:19.792 --> 34:21.058
you'll need alcohol.

34:21.060 --> 34:22.392
Got it.

34:22.394 --> 34:25.629
Now, pour a few ounces
over the powder, burn it off

34:25.631 --> 34:27.197
and you'll get an oil.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.399
Okay, I don't have matches
or a lighter.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.601
So, I'll have to improvise.

34:41.213 --> 34:43.580
Okay. Watch out.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.650
(exhales sharply)

34:46.652 --> 34:49.586
We did it, we
got the oil!

34:49.588 --> 34:51.254
Great, now you just got to
put it under their tongues

34:51.256 --> 34:53.423
to get it right
into their bloodstreams.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.591
It's potent. If it'll work,
it'll work instantaneously.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.012
(flame surges)

34:59.013 --> 35:00.796
Oh, no. I think I
inhaled too much ergot.

35:00.799 --> 35:02.833
I'm-I'm seeing
a purple flame.

35:06.238 --> 35:08.055
You're not hallucinating.

35:08.056 --> 35:09.873
Potassium chloride,
a component in deicer,

35:09.875 --> 35:12.476
burns purple.
So, when I lit the alcohol,

35:12.478 --> 35:14.444
a spark must have
caught the sacks on fire.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.180
Need I remind you
that right behind that door

35:17.182 --> 35:20.183
is a tunnel filled
with very flammable oxygen?

35:20.185 --> 35:22.452
If those any of those flames
reach that door, kaboom!

35:22.454 --> 35:24.554
That whole place
will be blown to pieces!

35:31.396 --> 35:33.447
Toby, the flames are spreading
and I have no way

35:33.448 --> 35:35.499
of putting out a chemical fire!
Why the hell is there
even deicer in here?

35:35.501 --> 35:37.300
It snows outside, not inside.
It's to prevent
the ice buildup

35:37.302 --> 35:39.836
in the refrigerant tanks.
Wait a minute.

35:39.838 --> 35:43.306
We can use the carbon dioxide
in the refrigerant tanks

35:43.308 --> 35:44.641
to build a fire extinguisher.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.209
Now, Paige,
the others don't have long,

35:46.211 --> 35:48.178
so go give them the oil.

35:48.180 --> 35:49.446
And I will put
out this fire.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.221
You're okay.

35:58.223 --> 36:02.225
You're okay,
come on.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.894
Oh, I had a
messed up dream.

36:03.896 --> 36:05.562
Tell me
about it later.

36:05.563 --> 36:07.229
Right now,
you need a bit of fresh oxygen

36:07.232 --> 36:08.665
and then
we got to save the others.

36:08.667 --> 36:10.200
Okay?
All right.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.402
(Cabe grunts)

36:18.810 --> 36:20.310
Chickens!

36:28.921 --> 36:30.554
I made it
through the '60s clean,

36:30.556 --> 36:32.322
just to trip out in 2017.

36:32.324 --> 36:33.290
We all did.

36:33.292 --> 36:34.758
Dirty hippies, gross.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.226
Every breath
increases a chance of relapse

36:36.228 --> 36:37.494
so hurry up outside.

36:37.496 --> 36:39.396
Toby, how's Walt doing
with the fire?

36:39.398 --> 36:40.664
TOBY:
Flames burned out the vault's

36:40.666 --> 36:42.866
closed circuit TV.
I lost contact with him

36:42.868 --> 36:44.401
while he was building
the fire extinguisher.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.369
I have no idea
if he's okay or not.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.574
Oh, wait, I see him.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.582
What the hell?

37:01.753 --> 37:02.752
You ready to get out of here?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.287
(gasps)
You okay?

37:04.289 --> 37:06.256
Yeah, I think I got a
little ergot on the brain.

37:06.258 --> 37:07.390
Let's go home.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.700
Guess I scared Mr. Dodd off.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.235
I don't scare that easy!

37:19.471 --> 37:21.738
Mr. Dodd.
Better late than never.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.474
Please take your position
at the lectern and we can begin.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.011
You got this, kid.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.512
Go on, Sly. Come on.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.617
Are we ready to begin?

37:33.619 --> 37:36.586
Yes, and I would like to
apologize for my lateness.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.255
I was out of the country

37:38.257 --> 37:39.256
working for Homeland.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.790
PATEL:
For the record,

37:40.792 --> 37:43.026
Mr. Dodd is not employed
by Homeland.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.328
He's only
an independent contractor.

37:48.533 --> 37:50.767
Uh, may we
let the moderator begin, please?

37:50.769 --> 37:52.469
MODERATOR:
The comic book store seems to be

37:52.471 --> 37:55.272
the basis of your platform,
so please address it.

37:55.274 --> 37:58.475
Uh, I believe that
eminent domain is abuse

37:58.477 --> 38:00.761
of government power.

38:00.762 --> 38:03.046
Really? Was it an abuse
when the Erie Canal was built?

38:03.048 --> 38:06.349
No, but it's not 1825
and the stakes are a lot smaller

38:06.351 --> 38:07.851
than enabling
the American shipping industry

38:07.853 --> 38:09.986
to get from the Atlantic
to the Midwest.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.554
The matter at hand

38:11.556 --> 38:13.390
is taking
private property

38:13.392 --> 38:16.426
to help, not the populace,
but a big box store.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.828
The kind of store
grown-ups go to.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.398
Yes.

38:21.400 --> 38:23.833
I patronize
the Warlock's Chest.

38:23.835 --> 38:26.336
I had a tough childhood,
I was picked on.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.571
Make-believe was my refuge.

38:28.573 --> 38:30.874
I found solace
amongst the fantasy

38:30.876 --> 38:34.911
and I would gather up my courage
to face another day.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.546
And trust me,
when I was a kid,

38:36.548 --> 38:38.415
I needed courage
just to show up at school.

38:38.417 --> 38:41.017
And I need it now
for my job.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.053
But the difference is,
with Scorpion,

38:43.055 --> 38:47.324
I have a team to help me
remember that I can be brave.

38:47.326 --> 38:50.660
And if the Warlock's Chest
will provide refuge

38:50.662 --> 38:55.665
for more kids who don't know
they're brave yet, well...

38:55.667 --> 38:57.667
I want it to stick around.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.069
(quiet murmurs)

38:59.071 --> 39:01.438
Wow, he's doing great.
Yeah.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.157
PATEL:
Brave?

39:04.158 --> 39:06.875
You ran away from your problems
by hiding in a comic store.

39:06.878 --> 39:08.378
Sounds chicken to me.

39:08.380 --> 39:09.546
Chicken?

39:09.548 --> 39:13.416
Sir, I know chickens.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.418
I have been
around chickens

39:15.420 --> 39:17.454
and I, sir,

39:17.456 --> 39:19.489
am no chicken.

39:19.491 --> 39:20.690
For example,

39:20.692 --> 39:22.025
I fear public speaking,

39:22.027 --> 39:24.961
and yet, here I am,
facing my fear,

39:24.963 --> 39:26.963
kicking your ass in a debate.

39:33.405 --> 39:34.604
MODERATOR:
Moving on...

39:34.606 --> 39:37.107
Sly's on fire.
Great work.

39:37.109 --> 39:39.142
It's all him.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.977
You want to get
a bite after this?

39:40.979 --> 39:43.446
MODERATOR: What would you say
to voters who may be looking...

39:43.448 --> 39:46.049
Okay.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.651
But no Vegan Thrill, okay?
I hate that place.

39:48.653 --> 39:51.388
Been there a
dozen times.

39:51.390 --> 39:53.523
Hated it every time.

39:55.627 --> 40:00.663
Look, I've been terrified
about our age difference.

40:00.665 --> 40:03.933
I hate kale,
I need reading glasses

40:03.935 --> 40:06.469
and I enjoy
getting senior discounts.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.638
But the thing
I'm really crazy about is you.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.940
You're the first woman
I've really enjoyed being with

40:10.942 --> 40:12.475
in a long time.

40:12.477 --> 40:14.677
But I got to know
that you're comfortable with me

40:14.679 --> 40:17.480
the way I am: a little weathered
and stronger for it.

40:17.482 --> 40:21.584
'Cause I can't change who I am
and I wouldn't want to.

40:21.586 --> 40:23.420
Those years make me who I am.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.155
SYLVESTER: ...out of town
to replace with a behemoth.

40:25.157 --> 40:30.894
I like classic cars,
vintage clothes, Sinatra.

40:30.896 --> 40:33.563
You fit right in my
wheelhouse, Mr. Gallo.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.771
SYLVESTER: ...which I have,
you'll see that those jobs

40:41.773 --> 40:44.073
you're mentioning
are all part-time.

40:44.075 --> 40:48.745
Looks like you did a good job
knocking that fear out of Cabe.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.713
WALTER:
I guess I did.

40:50.715 --> 40:52.615
So, that fungus

40:52.617 --> 40:55.218
really makes you
see your darkest fears, huh?

40:55.220 --> 40:57.687
Yes, in most basic terms,
the amygdala and the cortex

40:57.689 --> 40:59.756
that contribute
to the fear output

40:59.758 --> 41:00.924
are affected.

41:00.926 --> 41:05.028
Oh, it's all
very interesting.

41:05.030 --> 41:08.731
Did you see something?
A fear of yours?

41:08.733 --> 41:10.667
No.

41:10.669 --> 41:13.102
Maybe. No.
It was nothing.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.704
I got to
get some air.

41:16.241 --> 41:17.607
Okay.

41:17.609 --> 41:21.578
SYLVESTER:
Any problem can be solved.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.646
Did you notice anything
weird about Paige?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.216
Yeah, ergot can mess with you
for a few days, she'll be fine.

41:26.218 --> 41:28.051
She just needs
to sleep it off

41:28.053 --> 41:29.552
like my little princess here.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.855
SYLVESTER
...all politicians die...

41:31.857 --> 41:33.490
Man, she had a rough one.

41:33.492 --> 41:36.559
I hope
she's having sweet dreams.

41:36.561 --> 41:38.161
She deserves it.

41:41.233 --> 41:43.500
MS. WELDY:
<i> Good afternoon, children.</i>

41:43.502 --> 41:45.352
CHILDREN:
<i> Good afternoon, Ms. Weldy.</i>

41:45.353 --> 41:47.203
YOUNG TOBY:<i> Hi, I'm Tobias.</i>
<i> I'm new here.</i>

41:47.205 --> 41:48.838
<i> Nice. Tuna fish.</i>

41:51.543 --> 41:52.842
I like your pigtails.

41:52.844 --> 41:54.611
Did you know
the term "pigtail"

41:54.613 --> 41:56.546
comes from a twist
of chewing tobacco?

41:56.548 --> 41:58.581
Just shut up
and you can hold my hand.

41:58.583 --> 42:00.683
Offer accepted.
