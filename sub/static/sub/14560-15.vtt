WEBVTT

00:13.381 --> 00:15.483
WOMAN (over earpiece):
Suspect approaching location.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.754
Suspect entering building.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.627
DAVID (over earpiece):
Suspect plus two

00:26.660 --> 00:27.695
on the move.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.432
ROBIN: Would you please identify
that man?

00:31.465 --> 00:32.366
DAVID:
Damian Lake.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.236
And is he in this courtroom
right now?

00:37.271 --> 00:39.107
Let the record show
that the witness

00:39.140 --> 00:40.641
identified the defendant.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.110
And then what happened?

00:43.177 --> 00:44.078
Baby, there
you are.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.715
Where's our friend?

00:47.748 --> 00:50.418
ROBIN: Why was the FBI
surveilling Mr. Lake?

00:50.451 --> 00:52.853
NIKKI:
Damian Lake owns

00:52.886 --> 00:55.356
Consultants International,
which operates a fleet

00:55.389 --> 00:58.526
of cargo planes suspected in
the transfer of illegal weapons

00:58.559 --> 01:00.228
to elements in 16 countries,

01:00.261 --> 01:04.198
including Somalia,
Iraq, and Afghanistan.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.568
And why was the FBI at
the Crown Prince Hotel that day?

01:07.601 --> 01:10.138
We set up a meeting
between Mr. Lake

01:10.171 --> 01:12.140
and an undercover agent.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.674
Lake, I'm Jack Higgins.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.477
Well, if we're
not gonna deal,

01:16.510 --> 01:18.346
this hotel has an excellent spa,

01:18.379 --> 01:19.680
so it's a win for me either way.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.883
Jack, heard you got your start
supplying the IRA

01:22.916 --> 01:24.885
when the Libyan pipeline
ran dry in '97.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.420
Opportunity knocked.

01:26.454 --> 01:27.755
Fortunately in this business,

01:27.788 --> 01:30.090
when one market dries up,
there's always another.

01:32.460 --> 01:35.163
Erica Daniels was
an FBI informant.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.765
She was also
Damian Lake's girlfriend.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.803
Why did she agree
to work with the FBI?

01:42.836 --> 01:44.638
COLBY:
Her brother served two tours

01:44.672 --> 01:45.773
in Afghanistan.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.708
And the idea that
a weapon Lake sold

01:47.741 --> 01:51.312
to Al Qaeda might be used to
kill him was intolerable to her.

01:51.345 --> 01:55.216
And what was her role
in the operation?

01:55.249 --> 01:56.750
To present me as a buyer

01:56.784 --> 01:58.886
looking to purchase
missile guidance chips.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.488
LAKE:
How'd you find me?

02:00.521 --> 02:02.223
You don't look up fire-and-
forget guidance systems

02:02.256 --> 02:03.224
in the Yellow Pages.

02:03.257 --> 02:04.292
Viktor Tramasco.

02:04.325 --> 02:07.261
Viktor.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.896
It's a terrible thing
what happened in Barranquilla.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.764
COLBY: Fortunate thing about
Viktor's death

02:10.798 --> 02:12.200
is it was quick.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.534
FARC rebels
would've tortured him.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.902
Yeah.

02:14.935 --> 02:16.537
Well, the other good thing is

02:16.570 --> 02:17.938
you don't have to pay
Viktor's finder's fee.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.373
Would've paid it.

02:19.407 --> 02:21.542
Anti-tank missiles
without guidance chips

02:21.575 --> 02:22.410
are pretty damn worthless.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.881
The product is delivered.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.250
LAKE:
Plug-and-play trackers

02:29.283 --> 02:31.952
for your PGM148 Javelins.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.522
He's no Vanna, but
I'd like to buy 'em.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.290
I take cash.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.970
You look relieved.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.505
What?

02:51.539 --> 02:52.640
What do you mean?

02:55.443 --> 02:56.677
We got a deal or not?

02:58.879 --> 03:00.514
Wait a minute. There's a
problem.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.014
Okay, B-Team 1, go.

03:01.048 --> 03:01.549
Let's go. Move in.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.816
Everybody, come on.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.753
Take a walk.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.222
DAVID:
The product is leaving.

03:08.256 --> 03:09.257
I'm on it.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.324
Everybody watch your line.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.759
You don't want to do that.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.826
Please, shut up.

03:17.398 --> 03:19.400
I lost Fox.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.305
DAVID:
FBI. Put your gun down.

03:27.775 --> 03:29.977
DON:
He had Ms. Daniels at gunpoint.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.581
Did you actually see
the defendant

03:33.614 --> 03:35.516
hold the gun on Ms. Daniels?

03:35.549 --> 03:36.584
No, it was

03:36.617 --> 03:38.018
behind her back.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.354
So, all you
really saw

03:40.388 --> 03:42.690
was the defendant standing
with Ms. Daniels.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.891
Easy... take it easy.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.264
(gunshot, people screaming)

03:50.298 --> 03:51.999
Put it down! Put it down!

03:52.032 --> 03:53.767
Put it down!

03:57.405 --> 03:59.907
(screaming continues)

04:03.076 --> 04:05.346
(gunshot)

04:05.379 --> 04:06.814
(elevator chiming)

04:08.816 --> 04:09.583
Don't move.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.285
She grabbed the gun. It went
off.

04:11.985 --> 04:12.986
Get over here.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.288
Take him.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.794
We should get her some help.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.366
DEFENSE ATTORNEY:
My client was there that day

04:25.399 --> 04:26.867
to meet a business contact.

04:26.900 --> 04:30.371
The FBI claims he was there
to sell contraband,

04:30.404 --> 04:33.841
but the supposed item
was not found,

04:33.874 --> 04:36.677
and there is no evidence
that it even exists.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.679
And there is no

04:38.712 --> 04:43.651
evidence that my client
harmed Erica Daniels.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.653
He was trying to protect her

04:45.686 --> 04:48.021
from what appeared to him
to be an armed robbery.

04:48.055 --> 04:51.392
FBI agents created
these circumstances,

04:51.425 --> 04:53.894
failed to identify themselves
appropriately,

04:53.927 --> 04:55.896
creating panic and chaos.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.599
Ms. Daniels,
fearing for her life,

04:58.632 --> 05:02.370
struggled with the one person
who was trying to help her.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.039
Her death is a tragedy

05:06.073 --> 05:09.009
that should be laid at the feet
of those responsible:

05:09.042 --> 05:11.645
the FBI agents at the scene.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.352
Erica Daniels was the one person

05:18.386 --> 05:21.689
willing to testify
against Damian Lake.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.525
And now Mr. Lake
wants you to believe

05:24.558 --> 05:27.495
that by some cruel twist
of fate,

05:27.528 --> 05:29.129
Erica was accidentally killed

05:29.162 --> 05:31.932
just as federal agents
were closing in on him.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.068
There's no twist.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.438
There's no fate.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.440
Just cruelty.

05:41.875 --> 05:45.379
This case is exactly
what it looks like.

05:45.413 --> 05:47.548
It's murder.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.053
CHARLIE:
What do you see?

05:55.656 --> 05:57.157
It's a bowl of water.

05:57.190 --> 06:00.060
Obviously. But there's more
here than meets the eye.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.429
See, math

06:01.462 --> 06:02.930
is a universally effective tool

06:02.963 --> 06:05.599
that can transcend
any box or bowl.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.168
It also allows us
to see or define

06:08.201 --> 06:10.704
and quantify things
that aren't readily observable.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.578
Hydrophilic spheres.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.480
They start as
hard crystals,

06:19.513 --> 06:21.849
but when you drop them
in the water...

06:22.983 --> 06:26.053
they expand to 300
times their size.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.956
And because the sphere crystals
are mostly water,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.824
they become invisible
once submerged,

06:30.858 --> 06:34.662
due to an identical index
of refraction with the liquid.

06:34.695 --> 06:38.165
You see, our tendency
is to see what we expect

06:38.198 --> 06:39.199
to see.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.568
Blue sky.

06:40.601 --> 06:41.935
White light.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.937
A clear bowl of water.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.474
But math teaches us
to expect more

06:46.507 --> 06:49.142
hidden beneath
the surface.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.912
JUDGE:
Has the jury reached a verdict?

06:51.945 --> 06:53.781
We have,
Your Honor.

07:01.489 --> 07:03.423
Will the defendant please rise.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.230
In the case

07:10.263 --> 07:12.566
of United States v. Lake

07:12.600 --> 07:14.902
on the count
of first-degree murder,

07:14.935 --> 07:17.004
the jury finds the defendant...

07:18.105 --> 07:19.540
not guilty.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.141
(gavel bangs, gallery murmuring)

07:24.111 --> 07:25.513
(chuckling)

07:52.706 --> 07:54.675
I hope you're thinking
of sharing the jackpot.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.109
I'm not predicting
the lottery.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.711
And for the last time,
I can't.

07:57.745 --> 08:00.213
I know you always say you can't,
but I think you won't.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.882
It's a spatial dynamic
jury model.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.184
It's a statistical model
of jury behavior.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.286
Was it developed
by 12 angry mathematicians?

08:06.319 --> 08:09.723
I'm trying to figure out how
Lake's jury reached its verdict

08:09.757 --> 08:11.625
using the sliding variable scale

08:11.659 --> 08:12.993
that allows
for multiple parameters

08:13.026 --> 08:14.728
affecting the dynamics
of voting,

08:14.762 --> 08:18.065
such as the weight a juror
places on the votes of others,

08:18.098 --> 08:20.233
uh, conviction floor,
acquittal ceiling.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.802
A simple "yes"
would have sufficed.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.004
Hey, listen, when
you're done with that,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.639
would you mind looking
at something for me?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.274
- Yeah, sure, what is it?
- My profile.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.308
I'm joining Facebook.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.309
Well, I figured,

08:29.342 --> 08:30.678
since I'm back
in college,

08:30.711 --> 08:32.145
I can hook up
with some old friends,

08:32.179 --> 08:33.581
you know, maybe even
make new ones,

08:33.614 --> 08:34.848
people with similar
interests to mine.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.317
Interest in what,
High School Musical?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.219
No, no, come on, Charlie.
It's not just for kids.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.589
I mean, a lot of different kind
of people are on the site.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.223
No, I know, you're right.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.994
In fact, there's over
100 million people on that site.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.329
That's what makes
the odds of finding

08:49.362 --> 08:51.331
any one person pretty high.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.566
All right, so,

08:52.600 --> 08:53.801
what should I put on my profile

08:53.834 --> 08:55.669
so that the right people
can find me?

08:55.703 --> 08:57.605
Well, just lots of specifics
about yourself

08:57.638 --> 08:59.072
so that the Web site's algorithm

08:59.106 --> 09:00.908
can match you
against a range of terms.

09:00.941 --> 09:02.776
- All right, like what?
- Like your interest

09:02.810 --> 09:05.178
in, uh, arts and crafts design,
green engineering,

09:05.212 --> 09:06.947
koi fish...
and don't forget

09:06.980 --> 09:09.016
one-dish recipes
featuring GruyГЁre cheese

09:09.049 --> 09:10.117
and/or ground turkey.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.686
That comment about my cooking
has just bought you

09:12.720 --> 09:15.188
one entire week
of turkey au gratin.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.860
COLBY: Damian Lake killed Erica
Daniels,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.228
practically in front of us.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.163
So, why couldn't we
convince 12 people?

09:23.196 --> 09:24.598
Okay, I want options.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.365
Let's go.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.366
Well, double
jeopardy

09:26.399 --> 09:27.935
protects Lake
from a mistrial.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.837
NIKKI: Yeah, on the murder
charge.

09:29.870 --> 09:30.938
What about RICO action?

09:30.971 --> 09:32.606
COLBY: Lake's
company was created

09:32.640 --> 09:34.274
as a cutout for the British
Secret Intelligence Service

09:34.307 --> 09:35.943
to move weapons
around the world.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.378
When he retired, he
kept the company intact

09:38.411 --> 09:39.512
and freelanced.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.282
Except for the selling
any weapon to any buyer part,

09:42.315 --> 09:43.083
company is legit.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.918
DAVID:
MI6 taught this guy well.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.353
I mean, he's only gotten better
with time.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.054
DON:
I don't care about any of that.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.789
I want to find a way to get him.

09:48.822 --> 09:49.489
For what?

09:49.522 --> 09:50.658
For whatever we can make stick.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.898
MAN: I was on the other side of
the world

09:57.931 --> 09:59.767
when Erica
was killed.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.636
She was worried
about me over there.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.205
I was always the little brother
she had to take care of.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.676
She was proud of you.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.145
She thought she could make
the world a safer place

10:12.179 --> 10:13.346
by stopping one gun runner?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.682
COLBY:
No, she thought

10:14.715 --> 10:15.916
it would make you safer,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.417
make a lot
of men serving

10:17.450 --> 10:18.952
our country safer.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.754
ROBIN: When she realized what
kind of man

10:20.788 --> 10:22.055
Lake was, she...

10:22.089 --> 10:24.291
she tried to do the right thing.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.328
My sister made a lot
of mistakes in her life.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.197
I didn't think

10:30.230 --> 10:31.298
trusting the government
to protect her

10:31.331 --> 10:32.766
would be one of them.

10:37.871 --> 10:40.040
I just keep going over it
in my head:

10:40.073 --> 10:42.209
the trial, what I did,
what I said.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.310
You ran a good case, you know?

10:43.343 --> 10:44.678
I mean, I would tell you
if you didn't.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.346
I lost.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.981
No, you didn't. We lost.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.684
Erica's brother is the one
who really lost.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.052
It just doesn't
make sense.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.221
I mean, we had the guy.
We had him.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.689
CHARLIE:
You're right.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.790
It doesn't make sense.

10:58.358 --> 10:59.292
So what we're looking at here

10:59.326 --> 11:01.862
is a spatial dynamic jury model.

11:01.895 --> 11:05.032
It's a visual rendering of
a jury's deliberation process.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.334
This is supposed to tell us how
the jury reached their verdict?

11:07.367 --> 11:08.335
Not how,

11:08.368 --> 11:09.937
but whether the verdict was

11:09.970 --> 11:11.404
a probable or improbable outcome

11:11.438 --> 11:13.140
for this
particular jury.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.808
You can predict how people think
using math?

11:14.842 --> 11:16.009
Using probabilities.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.779
Now think of a standard coin
flip, two possible outcomes:

11:18.812 --> 11:19.747
heads or tails.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.915
Normally, this is considered
a random event,

11:21.949 --> 11:23.383
impossible to predict.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.651
But using
probability calculations,

11:24.684 --> 11:27.921
you can make an educated guess
by factoring in such variables

11:27.955 --> 11:31.358
as velocity of the coin,
its weight, flips per second,

11:31.391 --> 11:33.326
the time and distance traveled.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.896
Knowing these variables
shifts the odds in your favor.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.197
You apply this to a jury,

11:37.230 --> 11:38.498
and it increases
your understanding

11:38.531 --> 11:40.934
of how a particular outcome
was reached.

11:40.968 --> 11:44.371
Now, due to factors including
the quality of evidence

11:44.404 --> 11:45.839
and witness
testimony,

11:45.873 --> 11:47.174
the probability

11:47.207 --> 11:49.476
that Lake's jury would convict
is overwhelming.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.410
So it was rigged?

11:50.443 --> 11:53.180
No, the jury was anonymous.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.983
Only the judge knew
their identities.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.117
They were sequestered
and guarded.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.819
That's not gonna stop him;
you know, this is the kind

11:58.852 --> 12:00.821
of guy that thinks he can
get away with anything.

12:00.854 --> 12:01.989
Well, there is the QJS.

12:02.022 --> 12:02.823
Uh,

12:02.856 --> 12:03.857
QJS...

12:03.891 --> 12:06.259
Qualitative Jury Software,
right?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.494
That's right.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.461
Courts rely on it

12:08.495 --> 12:10.163
to facilitate
the juror selection process.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.398
Yeah, that
software uses

12:11.431 --> 12:14.902
a pseudo-random number generator
called the Mersenne Twister

12:14.935 --> 12:16.770
to assemble lists
of potential jurors

12:16.804 --> 12:19.339
from DMV records
and voter registration.

12:19.372 --> 12:23.010
That software has access
to their names, addresses,

12:23.043 --> 12:24.477
and Social Security numbers.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.946
And who has access to it?

12:25.979 --> 12:27.147
Any technical questions you have

12:27.180 --> 12:28.415
about the court's software,

12:28.448 --> 12:32.119
you're going to have to ask the
company who makes it: JuryFind.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.220
You're a court clerk.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.922
You don't keep an eye
on all the operations here?

12:34.955 --> 12:36.356
I keep an eye out for problems,

12:36.389 --> 12:38.058
and JuryFind on speed dial.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.793
Their technicians
are the only ones

12:39.827 --> 12:41.461
with clearance to access
the system.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.429
Any problems lately?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.464
Let's see...

12:44.497 --> 12:46.934
It always summons people
who hate jury duty.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.302
When was the last time

12:49.336 --> 12:50.537
they sent someone out here?

12:50.570 --> 12:52.405
About six weeks ago.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.506
A guy installed

12:53.540 --> 12:55.075
a software patch.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.509
That's right before
Lake's trial.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.444
Do you know the tech?

12:57.477 --> 12:59.312
I know he cusses in Vulcan.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.213
Uh, yeah.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.214
He had ID,

13:01.248 --> 13:02.349
forgot his parking pass.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.851
Dude's car got towed
from the lot.

13:03.884 --> 13:04.985
COLBY:
Remember his name?

13:05.018 --> 13:06.086
No, but I remember

13:06.119 --> 13:08.521
suppressing the urge to ask,
"What would Spock do?"

13:08.555 --> 13:10.390
(chuckles)

13:10.423 --> 13:12.492
We're gonna need the name
of the tow truck company.

13:12.525 --> 13:14.962
Got that one on speed dial, too.

13:16.063 --> 13:18.065
Mr. Lake's

13:18.098 --> 13:20.400
defense team hired my services
as a jury consultant.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.835
In other words,

13:21.869 --> 13:24.537
you helped Damian Lake's
attorneys select a jury

13:24.571 --> 13:26.874
that would return a favorable
verdict for their client.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.876
Jury consulting is part
of the adversarial process.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.843
Check my record.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.611
You'll see that I work
for the prosecution

13:31.644 --> 13:33.346
as often as I have
for the defense.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.248
It seems to me that everything
you tell them,

13:35.282 --> 13:36.549
they could get
from the questionnaire.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.551
Ah, but a questionnaire
can't tell them

13:38.585 --> 13:42.355
that jurors' attitudes are
much stronger indicators of bias

13:42.389 --> 13:43.523
than their demographic--

13:43.556 --> 13:45.558
or that attitudes
towards rape

13:45.592 --> 13:48.228
are better verdict predictors
than gender.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.562
Is that your
scientific opinion,

13:49.596 --> 13:51.865
or the way you convince rapists
to pay your fee?

13:51.899 --> 13:53.600
(chuckles)

13:54.902 --> 13:57.871
I use calculated judgment

13:57.905 --> 14:01.441
to uncover what people
don't want to admit...

14:01.474 --> 14:03.643
on paper or to themselves.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.379
I'm an observer,
Agent Betancourt.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.081
You want to know
what I see?

14:08.115 --> 14:10.951
You dress like a Fed,
but you walk like a cop.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.186
You've had training
in debate and rhetoric,

14:13.220 --> 14:15.655
which leads me to guess
that you jumped to the Bureau

14:15.688 --> 14:18.191
with, let's see, a law degree?

14:18.225 --> 14:19.960
You have much loftier

14:19.993 --> 14:22.963
ambitions than your colleagues
even know.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.432
I'm thinking... politics.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.268
(chuckles)

14:28.301 --> 14:31.271
Shining a light
on other people--

14:31.304 --> 14:33.640
that's a good way to stay hidden
in the shadows.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.909
You let me know
when you run for office.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.277
You've got my vote.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.923
You really should consider

14:49.957 --> 14:51.624
something a bit more
fuel-efficient.

14:51.658 --> 14:54.027
Hey, you know,
your gate was open.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.495
Let me guess:

14:55.528 --> 14:57.564
this is where you tell me
that it's not over,

14:57.597 --> 15:00.100
that you're going to find
another way to put me in jail.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.602
Well, you got half a dozen
federal agencies on your ass.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.971
It's just a matter of time.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.539
I'm haunted
by my inescapable fate.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.575
Happy now?

15:08.608 --> 15:09.709
Just know: when you go down,

15:09.742 --> 15:11.444
it's going to be
for killing

15:11.478 --> 15:12.445
Erica Daniels.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.281
That's a legal impossibility.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.582
Something called
"double jeopardy."

15:15.615 --> 15:17.050
Maybe you've heard of it.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.418
You ever hear of a mistrial?

15:18.451 --> 15:20.687
(sighs)

15:20.720 --> 15:24.391
Maybe, uh, you and the DA
did a bad job.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.493
I'm a innocent man,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.395
free to leave the country,
go wherever I want.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.529
(engine starts)

15:29.562 --> 15:32.065
There's a world of places
where you can't touch me.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.377
ALAN:
Hey, Charlie.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.645
You want to
grab lunch?

15:45.678 --> 15:48.281
I'm meeting an old buddy from
high school, believe it or not.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.450
Huh, well, I kind of have plans
with Amita, Dad,

15:50.483 --> 15:52.619
but it sounds like this
social networking process

15:52.652 --> 15:53.753
is working for you.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.655
Yeah, yeah,
surprisingly well so far.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.992
I wonder if anthropologists
studying community networks

15:59.026 --> 16:01.028
in southern Africa
imagined that

16:01.061 --> 16:04.364
their work would lead to
"friending" and Scrabulous.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.733
It's like the space program.
It gave us Velcro, Tang.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.668
So, uh, how's
your research

16:08.701 --> 16:10.637
going on this
jury tampering thing?

16:10.670 --> 16:12.639
Well, my analysis indicates
that there's a good probability

16:12.672 --> 16:15.075
that the jury's verdict
was tampered with.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.409
But, uh, probability

16:16.443 --> 16:17.777
is not enough for a judge.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.646
You know I can't blame Don

16:19.679 --> 16:21.381
for taking this one
so hard.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.116
It's the system
that let them down.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.351
The system's not flawless.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.752
No, it's not.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.554
I mean, once you involve
human judgment,

16:27.587 --> 16:28.688
you're bound to get mistakes.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.725
Well, anyway.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.761
Unless...

16:34.794 --> 16:38.165
unless instead
of always mopping up,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.200
you keep the mess
from ever happening.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.268
How would you go about that?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.303
I don't know.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.139
But, uh, probability can be used
as a predictive tool.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.707
Maybe you can alter

16:47.740 --> 16:48.841
the circumstances

16:48.875 --> 16:52.712
so the potential crime
is less likely to take place.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.486
The company that towed
the software tech's car

16:59.519 --> 17:01.688
from the court's parking lot
ID'd him as Robert Logan.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.356
Now, I checked
with JuryFind.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.825
They have no record
of a Robert Logan.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.695
All right, so if he doesn't work
for JuryFind,

17:08.728 --> 17:10.630
- who does he work for?
- Exactly.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.144
Mr. Logan, FBI.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.648
Just once, I wish there
were a surprise party

17:28.681 --> 17:31.118
behind one of these
ominously open doors.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.730
Well, David, looks like
there was a surprise.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.732
Just wasn't for us.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.845
COLBY: Robert Logan's done time
for e-crime.

17:58.878 --> 18:00.247
ID theft, phishing.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.448
He's a hacker-for-hire.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.251
He broke into the system,
gained access to the jury pool.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.119
Got to figure
whoever hired him

18:06.153 --> 18:07.720
killed him to cover
their tracks.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.589
DON: We can't connect him to
Lake?

18:09.622 --> 18:10.857
DAVID: Techs are dusting the
scene and we pulled

18:10.890 --> 18:11.824
his bank and his
phone records.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.726
All right, let me know.

18:15.728 --> 18:19.566
Hey, um, I want to run
something by you.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.434
- Yeah?
- I'm putting

18:21.468 --> 18:23.736
for the primary relief
supervisor's position.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.739
So when Don's not around,
you'd be in charge.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.441
You asking me

18:28.475 --> 18:30.443
if I'm cool with you
being my boss?

18:30.477 --> 18:32.779
Well, I'm not asking you,
you know, I just...

18:32.812 --> 18:35.282
I want you to hear it
from me first.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.549
I think it's great, man.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.584
Have you told Don?

18:37.617 --> 18:38.751
No. Not yet.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.620
Hey, you do know
that I have the high score

18:40.653 --> 18:42.822
in the office at the combat
pistol range, right?

18:42.855 --> 18:44.791
Yeah. Why?

18:44.824 --> 18:45.858
Just something
you should keep in mind

18:45.892 --> 18:47.694
in case you try and order me
to get your coffee.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.730
Hey.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.765
Fox Carter, Lake's #2.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.234
- Mm-hmm.
- We've been watching him,

18:54.267 --> 18:55.735
you know, tracking
his contacts, trying to see

18:55.768 --> 18:58.271
if he and Lake are still
in business together.

18:58.305 --> 18:58.638
Yeah, what's he up to?

18:58.671 --> 18:59.539
Not much.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.308
Those chips he was supposed
to deliver

19:01.341 --> 19:02.275
the day we arrested Lake,

19:02.309 --> 19:03.776
they recently showed up
on the black market

19:03.810 --> 19:04.811
in Sudan.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.746
Ah, damn.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.481
Is there any point to staying on
Fox?

19:08.515 --> 19:09.416
Yeah.

19:09.449 --> 19:10.217
If Lake disappears
like he's threatening,

19:10.250 --> 19:12.219
might be the only
way we find him.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.888
Your dead hacker, Robert Logan,

19:15.922 --> 19:17.924
created an administrator
password

19:17.957 --> 19:19.792
allowing him to bypass
security measures.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.860
Once we break it,

19:20.893 --> 19:23.396
we can track his activity
in the court's software.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.632
Got it.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.700
Logan accessed
the jury pool--

19:27.734 --> 19:29.402
their names, addresses.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.204
So much for an anonymous jury.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.705
Yeah, Logan got
their identities,

19:32.739 --> 19:33.740
but we got
something better.

19:33.773 --> 19:34.841
Yeah, like what?

19:34.874 --> 19:36.343
The jury filled out
questionnaires

19:36.376 --> 19:37.377
prior to the trial.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.545
I can use that data

19:38.578 --> 19:40.380
to calculate profile scores,

19:40.413 --> 19:43.283
which would give us an insight
into the jury's dynamic.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.618
Hey, Robin.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.653
Hi, Alan.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.587
Come in.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.823
Uh, Donnie's not here.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.893
Uh, no, he called to say
that he would be late,

19:53.926 --> 19:55.328
but I was already on my way.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.597
Would you like something
to drink?

19:57.630 --> 19:58.831
I would love that.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.701
How do you take your coffee?

20:01.734 --> 20:03.403
With a red wine chaser.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.547
I don't think a lady
should drink alone.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.286
Whenever I wanted
the boys to open up

20:19.319 --> 20:20.920
and tell me what was
on their mind,

20:20.953 --> 20:22.555
I used to bribe them
with ice cream.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.724
Oh, yeah? What do you do now?

20:24.757 --> 20:25.792
Actually, ice cream still works.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.733
You know, as a prosecutor,

20:33.766 --> 20:35.735
I'm used to fighting
for victims.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.904
And I'm used to
winning that fight.

20:37.937 --> 20:41.608
Erica Daniels is gone...

20:41.641 --> 20:44.644
and her killer walks free.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.879
I failed her...

20:46.913 --> 20:48.948
- twice.
- You know,

20:48.981 --> 20:51.851
you and Donnie hold yourselves
to such perfect standards.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.886
We all know
the system's imperfect.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.888
I mean, um, innocent
people are convicted;

20:55.922 --> 20:57.790
guilty people are acquitted.

20:57.824 --> 20:59.626
That doesn't make it okay.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.394
No, of course not.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.837
Ah, my favorite future senator.

21:10.870 --> 21:11.804
You here to ask for a
campaign contribution?

21:11.838 --> 21:14.474
These phone records
show that Robert Logan

21:14.507 --> 21:15.542
called your office
several times

21:15.575 --> 21:16.809
in the past
few months.

21:16.843 --> 21:17.977
Who is Robert Logan?

21:18.010 --> 21:18.978
Computer programmer

21:19.011 --> 21:20.012
with a record of hacking.

21:20.046 --> 21:21.047
Now he's a dead guy

21:21.080 --> 21:21.881
with a bullet in his brain.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.051
We've connected Logan
to malfeasance

21:25.084 --> 21:27.019
affecting the Lake trial.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.054
What did you speak

21:28.087 --> 21:28.755
to Robert Logan about?

21:28.788 --> 21:31.491
I don't recall any conversations

21:31.524 --> 21:32.692
with a Robert Logan,

21:32.725 --> 21:35.662
and even if I did, if he was
involved with the Lake case,

21:35.695 --> 21:37.497
as a consultant for the defense,

21:37.530 --> 21:39.432
I'm covered
by attorney-client privilege.

21:39.466 --> 21:40.900
Not if you broke the law
and aided in a plot

21:40.933 --> 21:42.068
to tamper with the jury,
you're not.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.069
(chuckles)

21:43.102 --> 21:44.571
Now, that's
a pretty

21:44.604 --> 21:45.905
wild claim.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.907
- Can you prove that?
- Working on it.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.909
You call yourself
an observer.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.311
What's your observation
of Damian Lake tell you?

21:53.446 --> 21:55.415
What are you driving at?

21:55.448 --> 21:56.416
Have you noticed

21:56.449 --> 21:58.851
how people close to Lake
sometimes turn up dead?

22:05.057 --> 22:07.860
ROBIN: The judge has reviewed
the evid hackingsoftware

22:07.894 --> 22:09.996
into the Qualitative
Jury Software.

22:10.029 --> 22:13.366
He has agreed to release the
names of the jury to the FBI.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.934
So you think
we got a mistrial?

22:14.967 --> 22:16.135
No, not yet.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.804
I mean, we don't know
what, if anything,

22:17.837 --> 22:19.005
Logan did with
the information

22:19.038 --> 22:20.640
that he obtained
from the system.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.409
Charlie's all over it.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.076
I can't go to the judge
with an equation.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.012
(chuckling):
Yeah, welcome to my life.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.117
And, uh,
and these data sets here

22:31.150 --> 22:33.820
factor in information gathered
from the questionnaires.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.155
What do the profile scores
tell us?

22:36.188 --> 22:38.625
This is
probable juror bias here.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.493
Okay, so 47 and below

22:40.527 --> 22:42.462
indicates jurors
that were pro-prosecution,

22:42.495 --> 22:43.830
52 and higher
indicates

22:43.863 --> 22:45.698
jurors that are pro-defense,

22:45.732 --> 22:48.701
and in between means
that their bias was negligible.

22:48.735 --> 22:49.902
According
to this,

22:49.936 --> 22:53.706
six jurors leaned towards
conviction, two to acquittal,

22:53.740 --> 22:54.941
and four
in the middle.

22:54.974 --> 22:56.108
- That's right.
- How are you measuring bias?

22:57.176 --> 22:58.144
With SJS.

22:58.177 --> 22:59.278
Scientific Jury Selection?

22:59.311 --> 23:02.482
Yeah, SJS operates under
the assumption that demographics

23:02.515 --> 23:03.816
predict attitudes;

23:03.850 --> 23:05.418
attitudes predict verdicts.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.886
Sounds like profiling.

23:06.919 --> 23:08.120
Which, by definition,

23:08.154 --> 23:09.589
presupposes
statistical analysis.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.191
I mean, it always comes
down to group dynamics.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.461
It's kind of like,
uh, herding cattle.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.828
Back in the Old West,

23:15.862 --> 23:19.866
they'd have ten cowboys
to drive thousands of cattle.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.034
Instead of trying
to control the entire herd,

23:22.068 --> 23:24.437
the cowboys would pick
a lead steer

23:24.471 --> 23:26.072
and the rest of the herd
would follow.

23:26.105 --> 23:29.509
They manipulated thousands
by controlling one.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.844
So, to determine the leader
on a jury,

23:31.878 --> 23:33.913
SJS factors in characteristics

23:33.946 --> 23:35.848
such as
age, gender,

23:35.882 --> 23:37.216
education, occupation.

23:37.249 --> 23:40.787
Your analysis has left out
the alternate juror.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.522
Juror number seven
was excused

23:42.555 --> 23:44.223
for a death in the family,

23:44.256 --> 23:46.025
and the alternate juror
took her place.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.960
Who died and how?

23:47.994 --> 23:51.097
The juror's husband was killed
in a car accident.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.632
Why, do you think
there's something more to it?

23:52.665 --> 23:53.866
Given the parameters
of this case,

23:53.900 --> 23:55.101
I'd say
there's a high probability.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.572
WOMAN:
They look like their father.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.874
According to the CHP,

24:01.908 --> 24:04.010
the investigating
officer ruled

24:04.043 --> 24:06.212
your husband's accident
as a single-car wreck.

24:06.245 --> 24:07.213
With me on that jury,

24:07.246 --> 24:11.484
Paul had to juggle work,
the house, the girls.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.720
Maybe he was overwhelmed,
in a hurry...

24:13.753 --> 24:14.987
Had he been in accidents before?

24:15.021 --> 24:16.756
He'd had a few tickets in the
past,

24:16.789 --> 24:18.891
but not
since the girls were born.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.693
Do you have children,
Agent?

24:20.727 --> 24:23.129
Uh, no, no, ma'am.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.264
Kids change you.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.134
From the moment they're born,
you look at life differently.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.702
Parents want
to be around

24:29.736 --> 24:33.673
for their children,
as long as they can.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.911
ALAN: You know, Robin stopped by
last night.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.847
She's really very upset
about this Lake case.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.915
Yeah, well, she and Don
are blaming themselves

24:42.949 --> 24:44.751
for getting Erica
Daniels killed.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.252
Well, I know,
but they didn't kill her.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.820
It was Damian Lake.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.756
That's the problem with
a lot of law enforcement.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.558
You know, it's messy;
it's reactive.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.526
Innocent people can get
in the way.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.662
So, are you still trying to find
a preemptive approach?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.096
You know, Dad,

24:57.129 --> 24:59.165
it's like a doctor in an ER
trying to find better ways

24:59.198 --> 25:01.067
to treat
patients

25:01.100 --> 25:02.835
that have been thrown
through car windshields.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.171
The breakthrough isn't
better medical care;

25:05.204 --> 25:06.272
it's seat belts.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.841
I am tired of treating
the symptoms.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.278
I want to find a way
to attack the problem.

25:12.311 --> 25:16.916
Don, the CHP's report on
Paul Montgomery's car accident.

25:16.949 --> 25:18.084
Turns out there
are trace elements

25:18.117 --> 25:21.120
of paint found at the scene
that didn't match his car.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.889
- What, they didn't follow up?
- No, they were swamped

25:22.922 --> 25:25.157
and they had no reason
to suspect foul play.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.192
Yeah, well, I do.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.293
So, the judge's record lists

25:27.326 --> 25:28.661
the alternate juror

25:28.695 --> 25:30.196
as one Justin Cerf.

25:30.229 --> 25:31.297
Just ran his social.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.298
Turns out
it was stolen

25:32.331 --> 25:34.200
from a deceased man in Norco.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.335
What, you get on a jury
with a fake ID?

25:36.368 --> 25:37.904
Yeah, though first he got in the
jury pool.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.205
And then he got on the jury

25:39.238 --> 25:41.240
after Arlene Montgomery's
husband was killed.

25:41.273 --> 25:43.242
Lake needs an open slot,
kills Montgomery's husband

25:43.275 --> 25:44.711
to make it happen.

25:44.744 --> 25:45.945
All right,
I want him in custody.

25:45.978 --> 25:46.779
We can't
arrest Lake

25:46.813 --> 25:47.780
until the judge grants
a mistrial.

25:47.814 --> 25:49.682
- All right, I'll call Robin.
- I don't care

25:49.716 --> 25:51.083
what it takes,
just get him in here now.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.163
FBI!

26:04.196 --> 26:05.164
WOMAN:
ВїQuiГ©nes son ustedes?

26:05.197 --> 26:06.999
No pueden estar aquГ­.

26:07.033 --> 26:08.968
FBI, seГ±ora,
por favor calmese.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.202
Estamos buscando

26:10.236 --> 26:11.604
a Damian Lake.

26:11.638 --> 26:12.805
Se fue.

26:12.839 --> 26:14.006
ВїAdГіnde?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.241
A-A Costa Rica.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.677
Yeah, yeah, I
got that part.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.285
COLBY:
Hey, Don.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.921
So Lake chartered a private
plane to Costa Rica yesterday.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.222
Interpol issued
a green notice.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.724
Agents have his photo.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.059
They're tailing known associates

26:33.092 --> 26:34.927
and, uh, surveilling
places he frequents.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.328
All right, pick up Fox Carter.

26:36.362 --> 26:37.830
- Lake's lieutenant?
- Yeah, I mean,

26:37.864 --> 26:39.365
he might know
where he is, right?

26:39.398 --> 26:40.867
What's up with the mistrial?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.301
It was granted 20 minutes ago.

26:42.334 --> 26:44.370
That's great.

26:44.403 --> 26:47.339
All right, guys.

26:47.373 --> 26:48.941
Where are we at
on the fake juror?

26:48.975 --> 26:50.209
He had a state-issued
driver's license

26:50.242 --> 26:53.012
under his fake name, so
we pulled that ID photo

26:53.045 --> 26:54.413
to run it through
facial recognition.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.848
Robert Logan hacked
the software

26:55.882 --> 26:57.249
and planted Cerf

26:57.283 --> 26:58.384
into the system.

26:58.417 --> 26:59.786
High-tech jury tampering.

26:59.819 --> 27:00.853
Yeah, and I reviewed
Cerf's questionnaire.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.189
I mean, this guy methodically
presented himself

27:03.222 --> 27:05.257
as the perfect candidate
for the prosecution.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.860
He's got the advanced degree,
the brother in the military.

27:07.894 --> 27:08.861
He was a victim
of home invasion.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.429
So if you look at the
questionnaire as a test,

27:10.462 --> 27:12.264
this guy knew
all the answers beforehand.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.200
Lake had to make sure
he was appealing to Robin,

27:14.233 --> 27:16.035
as she had a say in whether
or not he was impaneled.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.069
So either

27:17.103 --> 27:20.039
Cerf had knowledge
of Scientific Jury Selection

27:20.072 --> 27:22.274
or someone coached him.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.910
Somebody like
a jury consultant.

27:23.943 --> 27:24.877
Logan's phone records--
numerous calls

27:24.911 --> 27:27.213
to Mitch
Langford's office.

27:27.246 --> 27:28.948
Oh, so he's right
in the middle of it.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.883
Let's get serious on him, right?

27:30.917 --> 27:33.052
Don, you got a second?

27:33.085 --> 27:35.054
Yeah, what's up?
I put in

27:35.087 --> 27:37.323
to be your primary
relief supervisor.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.359
Okay.

27:40.392 --> 27:42.361
Well, uh, to,
to complete the application,

27:42.394 --> 27:46.065
the career board needs a letter
of recommendation from you.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.134
Yeah, I know
what they need.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.312
Still looking to sell
those chips for Damian Lake?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.280
Fox Carter,

28:01.313 --> 28:02.782
always leaving the party early.

28:02.815 --> 28:03.950
Aw, come on, guys.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.752
Why don't we take a look
in that white van

28:05.785 --> 28:07.486
over there? Maybe
we'll find ourselves

28:07.519 --> 28:09.021
some illegal firearms, huh?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.356
Go look in the van
if you want.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.258
You're going to find
a whole lot of nothing.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.225
- Then what are you doing here?
- I'm trying

28:13.259 --> 28:15.394
to meet a guy who's
supposed to set me up

28:15.427 --> 28:16.495
with some-- what I
would call merchandise,

28:16.528 --> 28:18.030
but you might consider stolen

28:18.064 --> 28:19.265
electronic goods.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.067
Can't arrest me
for being stood up.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.202
That's my life these days 'cause
nobody's doing business with me.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.838
Ah, boo-hoo.

28:25.872 --> 28:27.907
Tell you what.
We need one thing from you.

28:27.940 --> 28:28.908
Where's Lake?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.877
Where's Lake?

28:30.910 --> 28:33.279
Would I be out here looking
to meet some low-life fence

28:33.312 --> 28:34.446
if I was still in business
with Damian Lake?

28:34.480 --> 28:35.782
You're his #2;
you know

28:35.815 --> 28:37.416
- where he is.
- You don't get it.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.451
He dropped his local
network-- all of us.

28:39.485 --> 28:42.288
Burned a lot of people--
bagged out on deals,

28:42.321 --> 28:44.156
stiffed buyers. He's gone.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.224
Put your hands behind your back.

28:45.257 --> 28:46.058
Come on, really?

28:46.092 --> 28:47.827
Unless you got something to
give,

28:47.860 --> 28:49.228
we still like you
for the stuff

28:49.261 --> 28:51.798
you did back when you were
working with Lake.

28:51.831 --> 28:54.033
I'll tell you one thing
you might not know.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.167
Yeah? We're all ears.

28:55.201 --> 28:58.204
Lake did something to mess
with the jury on his case.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.072
Yeah, like what exactly?

29:00.106 --> 29:01.774
I don't know, but something.

29:01.808 --> 29:04.210
He said he wasn't going to go to
jail; he was positive of that.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.512
He give you any specifics?

29:06.545 --> 29:07.914
No, he didn't exactly...

29:07.947 --> 29:08.915
Wrong answer.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.983
Oh, not cool.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.556
CHARLIE: You ever consider
conceiving

29:17.589 --> 29:18.791
of a new way
to do your job?

29:18.825 --> 29:21.527
(sighing): All the time, man,
but you're talking to a guy

29:21.560 --> 29:23.395
who's spent his whole career in
the backseat.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.365
FBI is
a top-down organization,

29:26.398 --> 29:28.868
you know, and no one is looking
to me for suggestions.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.236
Well, Don values you.

29:31.203 --> 29:32.171
He doesn't say it much,

29:32.204 --> 29:33.572
but you can take my word for it.

29:33.605 --> 29:35.474
(chuckling):
I appreciate that,

29:35.507 --> 29:37.243
but it's his word I need.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.377
For what?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.546
Personal work stuff

29:40.579 --> 29:43.015
I probably shouldn't be talking
to his brother about.

29:43.049 --> 29:44.984
All right, fair enough.

29:45.017 --> 29:45.684
All right now,

29:45.717 --> 29:47.586
Lake put Cerf
on this jury

29:47.619 --> 29:49.321
to influence
others, right?

29:49.355 --> 29:51.523
He probably used threats,
bribes,

29:51.557 --> 29:55.828
but on all 11 jurors
and nobody talked?

29:55.862 --> 29:57.163
Well, Lake didn't need
all of them.

29:57.196 --> 29:59.265
Well, he needed
a unanimous vote, though.

29:59.298 --> 30:01.367
But a consistent minority
is often more influential

30:01.400 --> 30:02.935
than a majority.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.872
Uh... I'm usually one
for drinking the math Kool-Aid,

30:05.905 --> 30:06.839
but that doesn't sound right.

30:06.873 --> 30:09.408
(chuckling):
All right, look at it this way.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.043
My dad just joined Facebook.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.411
Really?

30:12.444 --> 30:16.082
Yeah, I know,
but that Web site relies

30:16.115 --> 30:18.584
on people who have a high SNP--

30:18.617 --> 30:20.352
social networking
potential--

30:20.386 --> 30:22.088
to expand its user base.

30:22.121 --> 30:23.522
So these are people
who are known

30:23.555 --> 30:25.324
for their ability
to exert their influence

30:25.357 --> 30:26.558
on other people,

30:26.592 --> 30:28.360
like tastemakers
and style leaders,

30:28.394 --> 30:30.562
what Michael Lewis calls
"mavens."

30:30.596 --> 30:32.899
Successful marketing campaigns
target these people.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.100
So...

30:34.133 --> 30:36.936
a few key people on the jury
could influence the others,

30:36.969 --> 30:37.970
and Cerf would know

30:38.004 --> 30:39.138
which ones to pick?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.272
Langford, as a jury consultant,

30:40.306 --> 30:42.942
would know how to run an
analysis to select those people,

30:42.975 --> 30:45.411
just like my model
is doing right now.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.613
Uh, in fact it's quite close
to identifying

30:47.646 --> 30:49.381
which jurors were
his likely targets,

30:49.415 --> 30:51.550
the ones chosen

30:51.583 --> 30:54.887
to turn the entire jury.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.055
Uh, there it is.

30:57.389 --> 31:00.392
Linda Parker
and Roy Detchemendy.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.629
Okay, so, uh, Linda Parker.

31:03.662 --> 31:06.565
She's a single mother,
homemaker,

31:06.598 --> 31:08.000
so she's a unifier.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.302
And, uh,

31:10.336 --> 31:12.138
Roy, Roy Detchemendy.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.173
He is the personnel director

31:14.206 --> 31:15.207
for a large
financial institution.

31:15.241 --> 31:16.408
He's educated.

31:16.442 --> 31:17.576
He's a communicator.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.011
And it's
highly probable

31:19.045 --> 31:21.380
that these two jurors plus Cerf

31:21.413 --> 31:24.383
were the influential ones
that led the entire group.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.989
My client will talk if
he's guaranteed immunity.

31:31.958 --> 31:34.961
COLBY: Ms. Parker, we can
protect you,

31:34.994 --> 31:36.996
but you have to tell us
what happened.

31:37.029 --> 31:40.466
When I got the summons, it
couldn't have been worse timing.

31:40.499 --> 31:41.700
I had just lost my job.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.702
I was facing
foreclosure.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.304
One night at the hotel,

31:45.337 --> 31:48.474
somebody slipped an envelope
under my door.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.543
Pictures of my children
with bull's-eyes on their faces.

31:51.577 --> 31:54.013
On the back were two words.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.714
"Not guilty."

31:55.747 --> 31:57.049
Written next

31:57.083 --> 31:58.550
to my bank's
routing number

31:58.584 --> 32:01.220
and the money I needed
to keep my house.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.222
LINDA:
There were three of us

32:03.255 --> 32:04.523
who pushed for the acquittal.

32:04.556 --> 32:06.292
Were they being threatened,
as well?

32:06.325 --> 32:07.459
I didn't ask.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.028
I didn't know who to trust.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.497
We were being guarded
and sequestered.

32:11.530 --> 32:14.633
If they could get to me,
they could get to my children.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.202
DAVID:
What can you tell me

32:16.235 --> 32:17.469
about Justin Cerf?

32:17.503 --> 32:20.139
He's okay, I guess, friendly.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.074
You guys talk
about anything personal?

32:22.108 --> 32:24.210
We all kept it
very professional.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.346
Except, some of the other jurors
teased him.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.280
About what?

32:28.314 --> 32:31.017
Justin had a thing
for the delivery girl

32:31.050 --> 32:32.218
from the deli
where we ordered lunch.

32:32.251 --> 32:33.385
Flirted with her a lot.

32:33.419 --> 32:35.721
Uh, juror guy.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.323
Yeah, I remember him.

32:37.356 --> 32:38.490
Chicken salad
on rye.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.059
Did he ask
for your number?

32:40.092 --> 32:41.527
Well...

32:41.560 --> 32:42.628
And did you give it to him?

32:42.661 --> 32:45.131
Well, I don't go
for chicken salad.

32:45.164 --> 32:47.266
More of a roast beef
kind of girl.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.038
Listen, if he tries

32:52.071 --> 32:54.040
to contact you,
just give us a call.

32:54.073 --> 32:56.375
Oh, well, uh,
if it's contact you want...

32:56.408 --> 32:58.477
I hung onto the number.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.112
I mean,

33:00.146 --> 33:01.613
just because I don't go
for chicken salad

33:01.647 --> 33:03.315
doesn't mean
chicken salad don't go for me.

33:03.349 --> 33:05.751
Thank you.

33:09.055 --> 33:11.523
So, the phone number
comes back to Gregg Silver,

33:11.557 --> 33:14.326
but the DMV photo
matches Justin Cerf.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.727
Can we get an address?

33:15.761 --> 33:17.729
Yeah.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.565
Hey, man, let me
ask you something.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.133
Yeah.

33:21.167 --> 33:23.735
I seem like a roast beef
kind of guy to you?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.304
I won't discuss
another man's meat.

33:28.807 --> 33:30.309
G...

33:30.342 --> 33:32.078
I think it's G.

33:36.148 --> 33:36.548
Gregg Silver?

33:52.198 --> 33:54.032
Hey, stop right there!

34:03.275 --> 34:04.176
Hey!

34:05.544 --> 34:08.080
How about we talk about
it inside, all right?

34:08.114 --> 34:08.847
(grunts)
We can discuss it

34:08.880 --> 34:11.117
inside.

34:11.150 --> 34:13.119
Listen, man,
you're gonna get yourself

34:13.152 --> 34:15.421
killed out here, okay?

34:16.322 --> 34:18.190
Hey, buddy, come on now.

34:20.126 --> 34:21.593
You got 40--

34:21.627 --> 34:22.861
It's a long way down!

34:22.894 --> 34:25.231
How about you
go back inside

34:25.264 --> 34:26.198
and we talk

34:26.232 --> 34:27.399
about it inside?

34:27.433 --> 34:28.767
You want to talk
about something?

34:28.800 --> 34:29.768
I'm a great listener!

34:32.571 --> 34:34.106
(grunts)

34:38.144 --> 34:39.611
You trying
to get yourself killed?

34:39.645 --> 34:41.113
I'm dead either way.

34:50.789 --> 34:52.758
I didn't know
what I was hired to do.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.493
I just did what I was told.

34:54.526 --> 34:56.428
Well, you're a diversified
con man, I'll give you that.

34:56.462 --> 34:59.131
Multiple convictions for fraud:
mail, phone...

34:59.165 --> 34:59.765
I don't hurt people.

34:59.798 --> 35:00.766
Hmm.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.535
Well, lots of people got hurt
in this case.

35:03.569 --> 35:04.703
I don't know anything
about that.

35:04.736 --> 35:05.671
Look, all I care about

35:05.704 --> 35:07.539
is what you did
while you were on that jury.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.744
I listened to the evidence.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.546
I deliberated
with the other jurors.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.148
I cast a vote.

35:16.182 --> 35:17.649
Same vote as everybody else.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.151
Why you singling me out?

35:19.185 --> 35:20.252
Because

35:20.286 --> 35:22.588
you created a fake identity,
went along with a plan

35:22.621 --> 35:24.456
to put that fake person
onto this jury.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.725
And that much
we can prove.

35:26.758 --> 35:27.893
That's a serious felony.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.796
Talking to you
doesn't get me anything.

35:30.829 --> 35:32.431
Okay, if you've got
nothing to say to us,

35:32.464 --> 35:34.233
we'll just put you back
out on the street,

35:34.266 --> 35:35.634
make sure everybody
knows you were in here.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.170
You can go hang out with
your buddy Robert Logan.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.506
Oh, actually, you can't.

35:40.539 --> 35:41.907
He's dead.

35:56.355 --> 35:57.122
What the hell are you thinking?

35:57.155 --> 35:58.924
I don't want to
end up like Logan.

35:58.957 --> 35:59.958
You won't.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.429
You just make sure
I never see your face again.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.364
How about my face?

36:06.565 --> 36:08.334
Turn around.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.973
Now, there you go.

36:15.006 --> 36:17.643
(handcuffs clicking)

36:17.676 --> 36:20.546
Oh. Round two?

36:20.579 --> 36:22.681
This isn't a game.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.616
Oh, sure it is.

36:24.650 --> 36:27.419
Well, you and I look at
the justice system differently.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.888
We are products of that system,
you and I.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.324
You're a prosecutor.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.493
You try to predict
what the defense will do;

36:34.526 --> 36:35.794
you attack; you counterattack;

36:35.827 --> 36:38.897
you hide things that
might damage your case;

36:38.930 --> 36:41.467
you try to take advantage
of your opponent's weaknesses...

36:41.500 --> 36:42.468
I don't break the rules.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.569
Rules?

36:43.602 --> 36:44.736
Wow.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.338
Now, you're admitting
it's a game

36:46.372 --> 36:47.506
without even realizing it.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.774
(chuckles)

36:48.807 --> 36:50.542
We're reviewing recent

36:50.576 --> 36:52.544
money transfers into
and out of your accounts.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.446
Silver's talked.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.548
You were the mastermind
behind the scheme, but the guy

36:56.582 --> 36:58.884
that paid for it is gone, so now
it's all coming down on you.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.687
Two murders,
dozen felony charges.

37:01.720 --> 37:05.824
That's life in prison
without parole.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.726
Hmm.

37:07.759 --> 37:10.529
Unless you answer one question,
and you answer it right.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.730
Where is Damian Lake?

37:11.763 --> 37:14.300
And don't tell me
that he's in Costa Rica,

37:14.333 --> 37:16.535
'cause we know
that he's not.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.305
I don't know. I don't.

37:21.440 --> 37:23.542
Well, show us how he paid you.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.312
Every record,
every bank routing number.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.279
That won't help you.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.581
He-He had everything encrypted,
untraceable.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.884
Well, maybe he's not as smart
as he thinks he is.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.466
Okay, so,
what do you got?

37:47.499 --> 37:49.335
The activity in Langford's
account is encrypted,

37:49.368 --> 37:51.670
in addition to being routed
through numerous overseas banks.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.439
It makes it hard to track.

37:53.472 --> 37:54.606
But it's not
impossible.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.842
So, what you're looking at
is a worldwide,

37:56.875 --> 37:57.976
financial
messaging network

37:58.009 --> 37:59.811
which links over
9,000 institutions

37:59.845 --> 38:01.880
in 200 countries.

38:01.913 --> 38:04.316
Its database routes over
11 million transactions daily.

38:04.350 --> 38:05.817
What, you're gonna find Lake
in all this?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.620
We're using encrypted material
from Langford's accounts

38:08.654 --> 38:09.621
which will get us

38:09.655 --> 38:10.789
the bank identifier code

38:10.822 --> 38:12.891
from which Lake made all
of his transfers.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.593
Well, I don't understand.
Isn't the whole thing designed

38:14.626 --> 38:15.394
to stop you from doing that?

38:15.427 --> 38:16.795
Charlie here's got
the NSA hookup.

38:16.828 --> 38:17.796
DON:
Oh, no.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.598
Who do I owe in D.C. for this?

38:19.631 --> 38:21.333
It's okay. I called in a favor.

38:21.367 --> 38:22.401
Oh.

38:22.434 --> 38:24.703
(beeping)

38:24.736 --> 38:26.605
Here's what we're looking for.

38:26.638 --> 38:27.639
The first four
characters

38:27.673 --> 38:28.674
are the bank code,
the next two are

38:28.707 --> 38:30.742
the country code,
followed by the branch code.

38:30.776 --> 38:32.344
- What's AW?
- CHARLIE: Aruba.

38:32.378 --> 38:33.512
So, pack sunscreen.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.587
Just leave it on the table.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.431
When she grabbed the gun,
it went off.

38:52.464 --> 38:53.799
WOMAN:
Not guilty.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.367
DON:
Just know, when you go down,

38:55.401 --> 38:57.035
it's gonna be
for killing Erica Daniels.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.679
It just keeps on coming,
doesn't it?

39:07.713 --> 39:11.517
Well, that's the politics
of the job, isn't it, Senator?

39:11.550 --> 39:14.420
Langford said that, not me.

39:14.453 --> 39:16.488
Yeah, but you didn't
deny it, right?

39:16.522 --> 39:17.956
Is that true,
Betancourt?

39:17.989 --> 39:20.626
Look, all I'm saying is,
in 20 years,

39:20.659 --> 39:23.462
I don't aspire to be
at this desk doing paperwork.

39:23.495 --> 39:25.130
Or looking

39:25.163 --> 39:26.465
at your two mugs.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.699
(laughs)

39:27.733 --> 39:28.634
Yeah, well, in 20 minutes,

39:28.667 --> 39:30.669
I aspire to be picking up
a hot delivery.

39:30.702 --> 39:31.903
The sandwich girl?

39:31.937 --> 39:33.772
Hey, roast beef works.
Why fight it?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.645
Hey, uh, Sinclair...

39:39.678 --> 39:42.113
I heard rumors
that you're a man with plans.

39:42.147 --> 39:43.615
Gonna be running
this office one day?

39:43.649 --> 39:45.717
Have no idea where you
heard something like that.

39:45.751 --> 39:46.718
Bad, awful rumor.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.019
You should check your sources.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.522
Well, my sources
are pretty good.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.800
*

40:08.740 --> 40:13.945
* All of this love
we feel today *

40:13.979 --> 40:18.850
* Drifts in our heart
and soul, we sing *

40:18.884 --> 40:20.486
Hi.

40:20.519 --> 40:22.420
How you doing?

40:23.589 --> 40:24.923
How was your flight?

40:24.956 --> 40:26.925
It was good.

40:26.958 --> 40:29.761
How's he doing?

40:29.795 --> 40:31.697
Oh, he's grateful

40:31.730 --> 40:34.500
that Lake's not gonna get away
with murdering his sister,

40:34.533 --> 40:36.735
but it doesn't change
what happened.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.770
He's just lost.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.071
So am I.

40:40.105 --> 40:42.608
Nah. Can't ever be lost.

40:42.641 --> 40:44.710
Someone's already
marked the way.

40:44.743 --> 40:47.045
It's just something
called halakha.

40:47.078 --> 40:48.246
It's from Scripture.

40:48.279 --> 40:50.181
You know, it means "the path."

40:51.650 --> 40:52.951
I don't know.

40:52.984 --> 40:54.185
I find comfort in it.

40:56.121 --> 40:57.222
Come here.

41:00.659 --> 41:02.928
You know, I never
told anyone this,

41:02.961 --> 41:06.498
but I almost dropped
out of law school.

41:06.532 --> 41:08.667
No way.

41:08.700 --> 41:12.103
There was this lecture that I
heard on the philosophy of law.

41:12.137 --> 41:15.507
Nietzsche argued
that real justice cannot exist

41:15.541 --> 41:17.943
in a society where there are
differing levels of power;

41:17.976 --> 41:19.745
that the powerful will always

41:19.778 --> 41:21.212
exploit the weak.

41:21.246 --> 41:23.515
But I stayed.

41:23.549 --> 41:26.752
I need to help even the fight.

41:27.686 --> 41:28.820
Yeah?

41:28.854 --> 41:30.221
Think it's possible?

41:36.862 --> 41:38.730
ALAN:
Hey, come on, Charlie.

41:38.764 --> 41:39.631
What are you doing?

41:39.665 --> 41:41.800
You're gonna stay
out here all night?

41:41.833 --> 41:42.834
Maybe.

41:42.868 --> 41:43.835
I thought

41:43.869 --> 41:46.171
- the case was all wrapped up.
- It was. It is.

41:46.204 --> 41:47.706
Taking one criminal
off the street

41:47.739 --> 41:49.307
isn't gonna solve the problem.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.710
Well, it's a lot better than
leaving him out there, isn't it?

41:51.743 --> 41:53.178
Yeah, well,
there's always another,

41:53.211 --> 41:55.146
or ten, to take his place.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.215
Oh, I see, and so,

41:57.248 --> 42:00.919
now your attempt is to try
to use math to prevent crime.

42:00.952 --> 42:03.254
Is that realistic, Charlie?

42:03.288 --> 42:05.256
I don't know.

42:05.290 --> 42:06.758
But I feel like

42:06.792 --> 42:09.294
I've been putting Band-Aids
on bullet holes.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.296
And I want

42:11.329 --> 42:14.299
to find a way
to stop the bullet.

42:14.332 --> 42:17.268
* Loudest thing I've ever seen

42:17.302 --> 42:20.271
* Now I know

42:20.305 --> 42:22.340
* For sure

42:22.373 --> 42:25.276
* Life is a dream.
