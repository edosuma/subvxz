WEBVTT

00:07.925 --> 00:09.256
[TRICK] Thanks for
coming on short notice.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.753
It sounded kind of urgent.

00:10.845 --> 00:14.463
There's a growing number of
reports of bizarre animal behaviour.

00:14.557 --> 00:15.592
Like just before an earthquake?

00:15.683 --> 00:20.643
Not quite. During an earthquake, horses
get restless, burst out of their corrals.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.686
They don't do this.

00:24.150 --> 00:27.517
An entire team of horses
electrocuted itself.

00:27.612 --> 00:31.446
Another story of bats down by the docks,

00:31.532 --> 00:35.024
streaming out of their cave
in the middle of the day.

00:35.119 --> 00:40.330
But what's most disturbing... is this.

00:40.416 --> 00:44.204
Every single snake at
the zoo has disappeared.

00:44.295 --> 00:45.785
Maybe they're on a plane?

00:45.880 --> 00:48.041
They're hiding, Bo.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.418
They can sense the Garuda is here.

00:50.509 --> 00:53.421
It's only a matter of time
before he strikes.

01:04.190 --> 01:06.397
[BO] Trick, get down.

01:06.484 --> 01:07.473
Bo, stop.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.978
--Oh.
--He's okay. He's okay.

01:09.070 --> 01:12.608
This thing with all of its
lovely smells is a friend of yours?

01:17.536 --> 01:19.117
Are you sure?

01:19.205 --> 01:21.662
He kind of works for me.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.614
It's okay.

01:26.045 --> 01:29.663
All right. I'll be in the bar.

01:31.259 --> 01:32.874
Oh, wow.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.593
What news, mole?

01:36.681 --> 01:39.639
The Garuda is nowhere to be found.

01:39.725 --> 01:40.931
You're lying.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.134
Why would I lie to the Blood King?

01:43.229 --> 01:46.392
My life is yours until my debt is repaid.

01:46.482 --> 01:49.519
I can't have the Garuda
showing up here unexpected.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.943
I need to know where
he is so I can strike first.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.737
Find him. Now!

01:58.411 --> 02:03.371
[whistle]

02:12.091 --> 02:13.672
[rumbling]

02:13.759 --> 02:15.715
[tires screeching]

02:26.939 --> 02:31.273
Good sir, a query.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.396
These chairs...

02:36.490 --> 02:40.403
...do you consider them
to be of a good quality?

02:43.706 --> 02:46.118
No. They're crap.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.995
Did someone tell you it's
"Jack-holes Drink For Free Night"?

02:49.086 --> 02:50.622
Lovely.

02:50.713 --> 02:53.830
We've been sent on an
errand to fetch someone.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.051
Him.

02:56.135 --> 02:58.717
Well, you're going to have
to get through me first.

02:58.804 --> 03:00.544
And me.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.379
Ciara.

03:07.146 --> 03:10.229
I hate to further break up
the sewing circle, fellas,

03:10.316 --> 03:16.107
but at this waystation, it's actually
a three ass-whoopin' minimum.

03:16.197 --> 03:18.153
So, shall we?

03:18.240 --> 03:22.404
Anyone who does not care to
get involved should leave now.

03:22.495 --> 03:27.865
Gentlemen, take care of the
bitches and grab the barkeep.

03:27.958 --> 03:32.201
I'm going to teach our dapper
little friend here a lesson myself.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.266
Bo!

03:59.698 --> 04:02.610
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.613
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.616
My love carries a death sentence.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.789
l was lost for years,

04:10.876 --> 04:13.538
searching, while hiding,

04:13.629 --> 04:17.793
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

04:17.883 --> 04:22.752
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.433
--What happened?
--Ow!

04:36.527 --> 04:38.643
Berserkers. Minions of the Garuda.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.979
Dude, I told you--protect the face.

04:42.074 --> 04:42.859
It was the only thing you had

04:42.950 --> 04:45.987
--going for you.
--Ow! Ooh!

04:49.457 --> 04:51.368
[KENZI] Oh, yeah.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.539
You're back.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.459
Heard there was a war brewing.
Never been one to pass up a good fight.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.411
They must have thought
we were shorthanded.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.121
Thought the Dal was vulnerable.

04:59.216 --> 05:02.049
Why would they think that, unless--

05:02.136 --> 05:04.843
Unless we got ourselves a rat?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.549
Not a rat, a mole.

05:09.643 --> 05:14.728
No! Get off me!
I serve the Blood King.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.932
The only thing that you've been
serving is information to the Garuda.

05:18.027 --> 05:20.188
Location, now!

05:22.114 --> 05:24.275
All l have to do is bide my time

05:24.366 --> 05:29.156
and my debt to the Blood King will
be paid with the King's own blood.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.202
Have it your way.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.583
What's that?

05:36.670 --> 05:39.833
My version of Archimedes' heat ray.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.672
Last chance.

05:50.768 --> 05:53.475
I'll try my luck with the Garuda.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.302
Have it your way.

05:59.443 --> 06:00.603
Don't you think this is a bit much?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.355
We're at war and we're
running out of time.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.982
We are not barbarians!

06:04.073 --> 06:08.157
That thing has enough blood on its
hands to deserve this, I assure you.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.614
There are going to be a lot of tough
choices to make in the coming days.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.996
You'd better find a thicker skin.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.918
[ALASTOR] Okay. I'll...

06:22.466 --> 06:23.922
Garuda's close.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.215
Location.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.964
The old abattoir.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.092
I gave you what you asked,
now release me.

06:31.183 --> 06:34.300
This is not the first time
you've betrayed me.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.306
I hope you rot.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.137
[whistle]

06:43.404 --> 06:44.359
[BO] What are you doing here?

06:44.446 --> 06:46.573
Barkeep comes with us.
Orders of the Ash.

06:46.657 --> 06:50.024
ls being a complete tool
a requirement at Guard College?

06:50.119 --> 06:52.656
You do know we're on
the same team, right?

06:52.746 --> 06:54.327
It's okay, Bo.

06:54.415 --> 06:58.374
If the Ash needs to see me,
that's his right.

06:58.460 --> 07:02.624
Although, next time, stay upstairs.

07:02.715 --> 07:05.172
This is my home.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.965
Come on!

07:10.723 --> 07:12.554
You all right?

07:12.641 --> 07:15.474
Pig Pen here was just
the tip of the iceberg.

07:15.561 --> 07:18.928
The Garuda was seeing
through Nadia, spying on us.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.934
There's no telling what he found out.

07:21.025 --> 07:26.190
Poor girl. ls Nadia okay?

07:26.280 --> 07:28.646
No.

07:28.741 --> 07:30.652
You?

07:34.830 --> 07:40.166
Well, I hate to say it, but we have to
find out what Nadia might have learned.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.959
The time for manners has passed.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.506
Trick grew wise to our deceit.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.676
Forgive me. He burnt my eyes.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.095
If you could do something
to ease the pain.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.922
Try getting stabbed in the eye.

07:55.017 --> 07:59.477
I do not reward incompetence.

07:59.563 --> 08:07.857
And I cannot help but notice you
are short one Blood King, Cleasby.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.198
Our intel was wrong.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.615
I didn't anticipate the faerie warrior
or the succubus being there.

08:13.702 --> 08:17.536
He must pour quite the
pint to employ such loyalty.

08:25.547 --> 08:29.290
Pity about the eye,

08:29.385 --> 08:33.173
but if you have no use for it.

08:37.810 --> 08:39.801
We cannot fail!

08:39.895 --> 08:43.262
If these Fae are determined
to stand together,

08:43.357 --> 08:47.475
then maybe it is up to
me to tear them apart!

08:47.569 --> 08:53.109
See what happens when they no
longer have each other to believe in.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.236
Here! Try that.

09:20.853 --> 09:26.393
[LAUREN] Nadia, it's me Lauren.
Fight it, sweetie, fight it...

09:26.483 --> 09:29.316
Do it for her. Do it for me.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.857
Sorry.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.487
The...

09:37.578 --> 09:38.988
The door was open, so I thought--

09:39.079 --> 09:40.740
l'm late, Bo.

09:40.831 --> 09:44.415
Trick told me that there was
an attack and that Hale is hurt.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.375
Don't you think it's a little
early for you to go back to work

09:50.466 --> 09:52.127
considering everything that happened?

09:52.217 --> 09:55.334
Well, I don't really think that Hale can
afford me to take a vacation right now.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.090
I'm just worried about you.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.672
Yeah, and I appreciate it.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.346
I don't really want to
talk about this right now.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.354
| just need to go back to
work and be of some use.

10:11.445 --> 10:16.314
Lauren, the attack today in the Dal
happened because of a leak in our camp.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.572
Is there anything that the Garuda may
have learned about us through Nadia

10:20.662 --> 10:22.368
that he could use to his advantage?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.821
Are you actually asking me that?

10:23.916 --> 10:26.828
Look, I know this is an incredibly
painful time for you right now,

10:26.919 --> 10:28.534
but we are at war.

10:28.629 --> 10:34.920
You're right. It is an incredibly
painful time for me right now.

10:35.010 --> 10:36.750
I'm sorry, Lauren. I thought--

10:36.845 --> 10:39.336
| just need to get ready.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.638
And I need to go.

11:05.457 --> 11:09.166
He suckered me. You know.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.125
He suckered me.

11:15.217 --> 11:16.707
Hey.

11:17.845 --> 11:19.961
Looks like our Berserker
friends are back.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.761
Best day ever.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.770
Miss me?

11:30.858 --> 11:32.564
D-man.

11:32.651 --> 11:36.610
Oh. Oh, I'm so glad you're back.

11:43.537 --> 11:44.993
Ciara.

11:48.876 --> 11:49.831
I'm glad you're here.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.910
Well, that sentiment's a bit late, isn't it?

11:53.005 --> 11:55.587
l'm joking, dumb wolf.

11:55.674 --> 11:59.041
I had to come. You know that.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.851
So, the Garuda made a serious
play for the Blood King, eh?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.768
I'm fine, thanks.

12:10.856 --> 12:13.768
I think you and I need to
have a serious little chat.

12:13.859 --> 12:15.269
I thought we'd already done that.

12:15.360 --> 12:19.194
All this time, we've been ignoring
our most obvious advantage.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.818
Enlighten me.

12:21.909 --> 12:27.449
Your blood could stop all this right now.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.200
I've heard enough.

12:30.626 --> 12:34.585
I don't think you're going
anywhere any time soon, Trick.

12:43.805 --> 12:44.885
You've looked better.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.464
That's what happens when
your partner skips town and

12:47.559 --> 12:51.598
leaves you to keep the
peace all by yourself, again.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.772
I'm sorry, brother,
but I didn't run out on you.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.645
On any of you.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.649
I went to find answers.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.903
Well, it must have been some questions.

13:04.993 --> 13:08.485
Hey, D-man, why don't you give us some
space, huh? I mean, I'm glad you're back,

13:08.580 --> 13:11.617
but why don't you be
back right around here?

13:11.708 --> 13:14.950
He just needs some time, Dyson.

13:23.470 --> 13:27.133
Is it just me, or are things
a little tense around here?

13:28.934 --> 13:31.676
Remember what we discussed.
We have a strategy.

13:31.770 --> 13:37.481
Bring him before me, put all of
my venom... We'll strike him down.

13:47.828 --> 13:51.912
Trick, we'd be fools to
ignore this opportunity.

13:51.999 --> 13:54.365
You have no idea what
you're asking me to do.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.120
Is that right?

14:02.718 --> 14:07.758
Take a good look at what
I've lost to this hell.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.088
This.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.969
This is all l have left.

14:12.060 --> 14:18.147
You have absolutely no idea,
absolutely no idea

14:18.233 --> 14:22.272
what you're asking me to ignore here.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.148
Where's Trick?

14:24.239 --> 14:25.945
He's with the Ash.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.445
Although, I thought he
would've been back by now.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.322
Then again, nothing has been
making much sense these days.

14:31.413 --> 14:37.579
I mean, horses are acting crazy, bats stop
being nocturnal, even snakes at the...

14:37.669 --> 14:39.500
...at the zoo.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.954
What?

14:42.049 --> 14:45.462
You have an extra helmet
on that bike, right? Come on.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.548
If you intend to force me to write
whatever destiny it is you want,

14:49.639 --> 14:51.595
you're wasting your time.

14:51.683 --> 14:55.141
My blood writing only works
if I do it of my own free will.

14:55.228 --> 14:58.766
And I will not succumb
to this kind of threat!

14:58.857 --> 15:01.724
If the Garuda succeeds, then the
battle between Dark and Light

15:01.818 --> 15:04.776
will start all over again and
then it will be all on your hands.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.194
Now is that what you want?

15:06.281 --> 15:09.239
You're playing straight
into the Garuda's hands.

15:09.326 --> 15:13.444
The last time I wrote with
my blood, the Garuda awoke.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.245
No one feels the weight
of that more than I do.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.789
Then prove it!

15:17.876 --> 15:19.036
No!

15:19.127 --> 15:24.212
It could bring upon us an even
greater evil than the Garuda.

15:24.299 --> 15:27.257
There's always a price.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.609
You're not a king.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.654
You're a coward.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.331
I wouldn't move if I were you.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.377
What do you think you're doing?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.929
I could ask you the same question.

16:15.016 --> 16:18.474
l've sworn to kill the Garuda.
It must be done.

16:18.562 --> 16:19.677
This is the only way.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.932
No it isn't.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.684
I will strike down the Garuda.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.391
--What?
--The wolf spirit came to me, Bo.

16:26.486 --> 16:30.149
It's been foretold.
I will defeat the Garuda.

16:30.240 --> 16:34.950
Bo, this is nonsense.
You're my champion.

16:35.036 --> 16:39.200
Then why did you just try and
take the fight into your own hands?

16:39.291 --> 16:42.533
The Garuda's near.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.709
I'm not myself.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.457
Just like all the other
snakes in the city, huh?

16:50.552 --> 16:54.170
I admit it was a foolish mistake
to force Trick's hand, but...

16:54.264 --> 16:55.879
...you've absolutely no idea.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.636
And what happens if you
make another mistake

16:58.727 --> 17:00.388
when the battle is at our doorstep?

17:00.478 --> 17:03.436
There's only ever been one way to kill
the Garuda and that is with my venom.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.390
Now all of a sudden, this wolf
is the answer, is this it?

17:06.484 --> 17:09.191
The wolf spirit isn't in the
habit of making things up.

17:09.279 --> 17:11.110
If she said Dyson will
strike the Garuda down,

17:11.198 --> 17:12.734
then there must be some truth to it.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.110
The message was clear.

17:15.202 --> 17:17.568
We go after the Garuda in the morning.

17:22.751 --> 17:26.039
Bo, please don't do this.

17:27.839 --> 17:34.881
I will follow Dyson into battle
because I know I can trust my friend.

17:34.971 --> 17:39.180
You, I'm not so sure about anymore.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.105
Can I get you something?

17:51.196 --> 17:55.485
How about some assurance that
you actually are the chosen one?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.191
I've no reason to doubt
what the wolf spirit told me.

17:58.286 --> 18:00.072
This wolf spirit,

18:00.163 --> 18:03.826
she wouldn't happen to be an
ex-girlfriend by any chance, would she?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.453
No.

18:05.543 --> 18:09.331
Come on, Dyson,
what exactly did she tell you?

18:10.882 --> 18:17.253
She told me that the clash between the
wolf and the eagle has been foretold.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.924
[WOLF SPIRIT] What do you seek?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.270
Enlightenment.

18:24.354 --> 18:30.475
Enlightenment will not fill
your void, but your actions may.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.399
Tell me what it is I must do.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.523
A great darkness is falling.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.857
It cannot happen.
The Garuda must be destroyed.

18:40.287 --> 18:42.949
Am I to lead us into battle?

18:43.039 --> 18:45.451
Wolves are born to lead.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.410
Your role in this fight
will be significant.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.922
How do | defeat the Garuda?

18:54.009 --> 18:58.594
The Garuda is a strong enemy.
But his pride clouds his reason.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.887
His omnipotence makes him vulnerable.

19:00.974 --> 19:05.593
The time to strike comes when
he believes he has already won.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.773
You have no idea how much I want
to believe what you are telling me.

19:15.864 --> 19:18.105
But you don't?

19:18.199 --> 19:21.111
It's just that l have been
carrying the weight

19:21.202 --> 19:23.238
of being anointed Lachlan's champion.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.867
And it is not a job that | asked for.

19:25.957 --> 19:30.872
But now the idea that...
that he could be wrong...

19:33.214 --> 19:36.957
I know this sounds crazy, Bo.

19:37.052 --> 19:40.010
But I could hear her voice inside of me.

19:40.096 --> 19:41.552
She spoke to me.

19:41.639 --> 19:47.726
We cannot go after the Garuda
unless we are absolutely positive.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.600
There is too much at stake.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.647
l'm positive.

19:56.988 --> 20:02.483
She told me that what I gave up
for you will be filled by my actions.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.784
I can get back, Bo.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.998
I've got to do this.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.882
[knocking]

20:39.531 --> 20:41.772
Can I come in?

20:41.866 --> 20:43.652
[BO] Of course.

20:48.206 --> 20:51.949
Do you have anything to drink?

20:52.043 --> 20:53.624
Yeah.

21:02.429 --> 21:07.594
Actually, I... think it
might be under my bed.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.427
I'll be right back.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.412
Hey.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.410
Forgot to give this back.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.617
No worries.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.998
Sorry to run off on you like that there.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.125
It's quite all right.

21:43.511 --> 21:46.378
You okay?

21:46.473 --> 21:49.465
No. No, not--not really.

21:51.811 --> 21:56.896
It appears we'll be rushing into battle soon
and we might not come out of it alive.

21:56.983 --> 22:00.567
Now if that's the case,

22:00.653 --> 22:05.113
I'd like to spend my last
night on Earth with you.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.031
Any objections?

22:09.287 --> 22:11.744
| just don't want to
confuse things, Ciara.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.664
I'm not confused.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.458
I'm just not taking no for an answer.

22:23.176 --> 22:27.715
Oh. Boy, I needed this.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.559
Life hasn't been very fair to you.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.934
Honestly, you're the strongest
person I've ever met.

22:40.318 --> 22:45.563
Do you know that I went home and
I did my hair before I came over here?

22:45.657 --> 22:47.898
Well, it looks great.

22:47.992 --> 22:51.280
No, I didn't mean...

22:51.371 --> 22:53.737
Thank you.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.163
It's just that the doctor
part of me never shuts off and

22:56.251 --> 23:01.541
I know that I'm merely acting out of
a transference of grief onto you.

23:01.631 --> 23:06.295
Wanting to have sex is a very
common response to grief.

23:19.357 --> 23:23.521
Biologically speaking, the transference
often helps move the pain.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.567
Sort of use it as something else.

23:25.655 --> 23:30.570
Turn it into something
different, something better.

24:03.610 --> 24:10.402
Yeah, I... I can see how
intimacy would do that.

24:24.088 --> 24:26.545
It's in much the same way that a
person who's having a heart attack

24:26.633 --> 24:28.874
often feels a sharp pain
in their left arm.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.756
It's the brain's way of redistributing
the pain so that it's not all

24:32.847 --> 24:34.838
concentrated in one area.

24:34.932 --> 24:37.469
I love it when you totally geek out.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.848
Can I sleep with you?

24:40.938 --> 24:42.223
Yes.

24:42.315 --> 24:45.603
Just mean sleep.

24:45.693 --> 24:48.935
In your arms?

24:49.030 --> 24:51.146
Yeah, exactly.

24:51.240 --> 24:56.780
Ever since I found out that the Garuda
was seeing through Nadia's eyes,

24:56.871 --> 24:59.704
ever since I had to watch her die,

24:59.791 --> 25:01.201
I haven't really been able to get--

25:01.292 --> 25:07.037
Lauren, you are always welcome here.

25:12.095 --> 25:16.589
Whew. There was a point there
I thought I might die happily.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.556
You were the one with the knife in bed.

25:19.644 --> 25:21.760
Yeah, that was new.

25:26.484 --> 25:29.191
It's almost morning.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.940
The time is close.

25:32.031 --> 25:37.071
Why do l have sand in places
there should be no sand?

25:37.161 --> 25:39.447
Stop laughing, it's really irritating.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.495
Sorry. I was in the desert.

25:41.582 --> 25:45.291
Oh, yes, the wolf spirit.

25:45.378 --> 25:49.121
Stefan went in search of her once
when he was to ask for my hand.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.456
He never told me that.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.667
What happened?

25:53.761 --> 26:00.382
Apparently, he ate some awful mushrooms
and spoke to a tree for three days.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.219
He nearly poisoned himself,
the lovely man.

26:04.313 --> 26:05.302
Oh.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.889
I miss him.

26:07.984 --> 26:11.602
He loved you. He believed in you.

26:14.532 --> 26:19.242
He believed in someone
I haven't been in a long time.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.946
| wish he was here.

26:23.040 --> 26:26.032
Everyone's put their faith in me.

26:26.127 --> 26:28.618
Well, you better deliver, handsome.

26:32.508 --> 26:38.879
Dyson, we've all put our faith
in you of our own free will

26:38.973 --> 26:42.306
because you're worth our faith.

26:46.397 --> 26:49.355
I keep thinking with Lachlan so
preoccupied with the Garuda

26:49.442 --> 26:52.525
that maybe this is
my window to escape.

26:54.113 --> 26:59.733
He keeps telling me I'll have some
important role to play in all of this.

26:59.827 --> 27:05.823
But I just feel like I've had enough
of the Fae controlling my life.

27:05.917 --> 27:08.283
| just want to leave...

27:10.129 --> 27:11.994
...for good.

27:17.762 --> 27:25.100
Whatever you decide,
whatever happens...

27:25.186 --> 27:27.643
...we are in this together.

27:39.992 --> 27:43.735
Let's just hope that Dyson
really is the chosen one.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.665
Hale.

27:46.749 --> 27:49.081
Yeah?

27:49.168 --> 27:51.705
No matter what happens in there today,

27:51.796 --> 27:56.415
you bring Bo back alive,
no matter what the price.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.841
Promise me.

27:58.928 --> 28:02.386
Promise. Not a scratch.

28:06.435 --> 28:10.394
Berserkers can only be
killed by blunt force trauma.

28:10.481 --> 28:13.769
A blade will only slow it down.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.727
It won't take it out.

28:19.365 --> 28:21.777
Here's the map for the Garuda's lair.

28:27.832 --> 28:29.993
War is upon us.

28:30.084 --> 28:32.496
The Garuda can sense
your greatest fears.

28:32.587 --> 28:35.499
He will manipulate them.

28:35.590 --> 28:39.924
He will try to turn you
against each other.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.967
The Garuda's not a god,

28:42.054 --> 28:45.842
but he's the closest thing to
the devil you will ever face.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.851
| wish you the best of luck.

29:13.044 --> 29:14.955
[KENZI] This place creeps me out.

29:15.046 --> 29:16.661
It's not too late to turn back, Kenz.

29:16.756 --> 29:20.044
Are you kidding me? I've been
waiting all day to kill me a Berserker.

29:20.134 --> 29:23.251
[metal clangs]
I'm too cute to die!

29:23.346 --> 29:25.132
What? It's true.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.837
Oh.

29:29.977 --> 29:35.517
Ladies, it's nice to see
you again, all of you.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.690
--You know what to do.
--Yes, sir.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.792
Where are your guards?

29:53.876 --> 29:58.119
Why are your aides removing
our intel? We're at war.

29:58.214 --> 30:00.500
I sent the guards to help Bo.

30:00.591 --> 30:03.833
--How many?
--All of them.

30:03.928 --> 30:09.264
Strange move for someone who
thinks this mission is a mistake.

30:09.350 --> 30:13.719
I can see why you put your faith
in the words of the wolf spirit.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.850
She's a divine being and
isn't one to exaggerate.

30:16.941 --> 30:19.728
Much like the Nain Rouge,
wouldn't you say?

30:22.238 --> 30:26.607
It seems that the Nain Rouge
came to Bo about this very crisis,

30:26.701 --> 30:30.614
which made Bo the
champion, not Dyson.

30:30.705 --> 30:33.037
Which begs the question

30:33.124 --> 30:35.957
has she ever had any visions
of her own about this battle,

30:36.043 --> 30:41.128
about its end game, perhaps?

30:44.593 --> 30:48.256
The Nain Rouge gave me a vision.

30:48.347 --> 30:53.011
l was standing over your body
and l was the one that killed you.

30:59.817 --> 31:01.398
[HALE] Call me a girl.

31:01.485 --> 31:03.146
When I find him,
I'm going to make him a girl.

31:03.237 --> 31:04.226
[BO] Something's wrong.

31:04.321 --> 31:06.858
[KENZI] Yeah, the stench in this place.

31:17.293 --> 31:19.124
This is it, Kenz. Stay close.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.200
Okay.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.252
--Maybe not that close.
--Sorry.

31:28.512 --> 31:32.004
I knew these posers
weren't real street like me.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.400
How wonderful.

31:44.487 --> 31:50.357
l have been so excited to meet you all.

32:03.089 --> 32:06.297
[cell phone ringing]

32:24.860 --> 32:30.730
The succubus who killed
her lover's girlfriend.

32:30.825 --> 32:35.489
I didn't kill her. I saved her from you.

32:35.579 --> 32:41.916
And stole the Faerie Warrior's
boyfriend and ripped his heart out,

32:42.002 --> 32:45.870
before she had a chance
to do it herself.

32:49.343 --> 32:57.933
The little rich boy who has
forsaken his family and his partner.

32:59.019 --> 33:05.310
The human with all her
little quips and jokes and...

33:05.401 --> 33:10.771
...well, is nothing more than a liability.

33:13.367 --> 33:16.200
And you, the wolf.

33:16.287 --> 33:21.156
No morals or loyalty, [tsking sounds].

33:21.250 --> 33:25.084
Guess that's what happens
when you lose your heart.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.207
Do you know what your problem is?

33:27.298 --> 33:28.208
Do tell.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.335
You think you've already won.

33:38.684 --> 33:40.345
The wolf defeats the bird, huh?

33:40.436 --> 33:41.471
It was foretold.

33:41.562 --> 33:44.520
Oh, right. The wolf spirit.

33:44.607 --> 33:48.270
How's this for a prediction?
Your ego is going to get us killed.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.395
Shut it, rich boy.

33:49.486 --> 33:50.441
Don't talk to him like that.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.645
Hale's a good man who's taken
far too much abuse from you.

33:52.740 --> 33:55.732
Guys, stop fighting.
The Garuda is doing this to us.

33:55.826 --> 33:57.441
Why don't you give it
a rest little miss perfect?

33:57.536 --> 33:59.151
You're the reason Dyson's such a mess.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.237
Tell me, was Nadia more
of a threat to you than me?

34:01.332 --> 34:02.117
Is that why you killed her?

34:02.208 --> 34:04.164
Leave her!

34:04.251 --> 34:08.039
[whistling]

34:08.130 --> 34:10.712
Kenzi, no!

34:10.799 --> 34:12.460
Sorry.

34:28.901 --> 34:30.391
No!

34:43.874 --> 34:44.954
I didn't think you were coming.

34:45.042 --> 34:46.907
I almost didn't.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.712
Well then.

34:51.799 --> 34:54.336
Let's get this started, shall we?

34:55.177 --> 34:56.542
What are you doing?

34:58.639 --> 35:00.095
[DYSON] Ciara!

35:01.433 --> 35:05.017
No. Ciara. Please, please.
Just hold on. Hold on.

35:05.104 --> 35:08.016
Be good to yourself, Dyson.

35:08.107 --> 35:11.645
You'll never truly love
anyone if you don't.

35:18.534 --> 35:22.823
No. No!

35:28.294 --> 35:30.626
Ciara, please.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.507
--Where did he go?
--Where did who go?

35:37.594 --> 35:39.095
The Garuda!

35:40.389 --> 35:45.429
Oh, no. If all the Ash's
guards are here, then...

35:46.854 --> 35:47.969
What are you doing? Leave.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.179
Please, don't do this.

35:50.274 --> 35:52.856
[shrieking]

35:52.943 --> 35:53.978
Better hide.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.560
I've been to battle before.
I will not hide.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.862
Now it's more clear than
ever that Bo's the champion.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.985
If I fall, she's going to
need your guidance.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.112
Now, Blood King, hide.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.195
[shrieking]

36:08.959 --> 36:10.540
Good luck.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.459
Hello, old friend.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.726
We have to get to the compound.

36:29.813 --> 36:33.556
Dyson. Dyson, I need you.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.775
Dyson!

37:05.933 --> 37:07.719
--Bo, get out of here.
--What?

37:07.810 --> 37:11.018
This was my mistake
and I'm going to fix it.

37:11.105 --> 37:14.518
No. It is my mistake.
I should have done my job.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.189
Hale, please just get her out of here.

37:16.276 --> 37:19.643
--We got to go.
--No. No, I am not going anywhere.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.899
Bo, we lost today.

37:21.990 --> 37:25.153
But they're going to need
you to lead them tomorrow.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.156
You've got to protect the Ash.
You've got to keep fighting.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.112
--Okay.
--We've got to go!

37:30.207 --> 37:33.244
l'll hold them off until you're safe.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.792
You can't die.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.835
I'm coming back for you.

38:07.119 --> 38:09.030
Kenzi, keep up!

38:09.121 --> 38:10.907
Right behind you.

38:37.357 --> 38:42.021
Funny, I remember there
being more of you.

38:42.112 --> 38:44.353
Was I mistaken?

38:49.286 --> 38:53.154
This may be my final head.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.240
But all it takes is one.

38:56.335 --> 38:57.950
One head...

39:00.088 --> 39:04.047
...one bite and one dead Garuda.

39:04.134 --> 39:07.092
Or one swing of my sword.

39:26.990 --> 39:29.402
Blood King.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.250
All right, Garuda.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.633
Let's end this.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.514
[whistling]

40:12.828 --> 40:16.412
Alastor Cornish, I hereby release you.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.910
Your debt paid in full.

40:29.678 --> 40:32.010
[BO] No, no, no, no.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.433
I should have listened to him.

40:38.520 --> 40:41.762
He said that l was the champion.

40:41.857 --> 40:43.939
But I wanted it to be
someone else, Trick.

40:44.026 --> 40:46.733
I needed to... I needed to give it away.

40:46.820 --> 40:51.860
You are the champion. A good man
just gave his life to prove it.

40:53.994 --> 40:57.862
Bo, the Garuda thinks
the venom is gone.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.198
He'll think he's invincible.

41:01.293 --> 41:04.376
We have an advantage.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.875
Together, right?

41:11.595 --> 41:14.086
Where's Kenzi?

41:14.181 --> 41:15.796
She said that she was right behind us.

41:15.891 --> 41:17.927
I didn't...

41:20.062 --> 41:22.223
I saw her double back.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.350
What?

41:24.441 --> 41:27.183
Why didn't you grab her, Hale?

41:27.277 --> 41:28.608
Why did we just leave?

41:28.695 --> 41:30.526
Bo, it's not his fault.

41:30.614 --> 41:33.777
I told him to bring you back
no matter what the cost.

41:37.954 --> 41:39.535
Bo.

41:44.044 --> 41:48.083
Not now. We can't lose Bo, too.

41:48.173 --> 41:50.209
Hale will find her.

41:54.346 --> 41:55.461
Oh, god.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.682
What?

41:57.766 --> 42:00.303
The venom's coagulating.

42:00.394 --> 42:07.357
Trick, if it seizes up, Lachlan will
have sacrificed himself for nothing.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.384
Man, he's heavy.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.723
He's alive.

42:38.807 --> 42:40.763
Don't you ever do that to me again.

42:40.851 --> 42:43.684
I actually had to hide under
one of the Ash's dead guards

42:43.770 --> 42:47.058
and wait for the creepos
to be insane somewhere else.

42:47.149 --> 42:51.984
l have three letters for
those guys, d-o-d'rant.

42:52.070 --> 42:55.562
I've really got to do this, don't I?

42:55.657 --> 43:00.117
This is on me, isn't it?

43:00.203 --> 43:02.945
Yes, it is.

43:03.039 --> 43:06.657
But we have all got your back, Bo.

43:06.752 --> 43:10.210
From a very, very safe distance.

43:10.297 --> 43:12.913
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

43:13.008 --> 43:15.841
You are not a liability, Kenz.

43:15.927 --> 43:18.839
You are just the thing I need.

43:27.689 --> 43:32.308
All right. Bring it on.
