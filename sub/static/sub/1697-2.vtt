WEBVTT

00:04.320 --> 00:06.550
l hate flag football.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.830
lt's just one more sport
where l get picked last.

00:08.880 --> 00:11.917
-And you wanna know why?
-'Cause you stink?

00:12.800 --> 00:16.679
Or 'cause you're pretty
and all the other girls are jealous?

00:17.120 --> 00:18.314
Nice save.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.511
Okay, look, l know l'm not good,
but l'm not horrible.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.551
Look alive, Stewart.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.229
Okay, l'm horrible,

00:26.280 --> 00:29.477
but you just don't know what it feels
like to always be the last one picked

00:29.520 --> 00:33.433
because no one
wants to be with Stinky Stewart.

00:34.480 --> 00:38.314
Not true. Last year in soccer,
l wasn't picked till practically the end.

00:38.360 --> 00:40.749
You had a broken collarbone,

00:41.280 --> 00:43.669
and you still got picked ahead of me!

00:43.720 --> 00:46.473
l just wish, one time,
some miracle would happen

00:46.520 --> 00:49.159
and l wouldn't get picked last.

00:49.200 --> 00:54.479
All right, Palumbo, Truscott,
team captains. Pick your team.

00:54.520 --> 00:58.832
Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Finally!
A captain who'll pick me first!

00:59.440 --> 01:01.476
lt doesn't matter
who you pick, Truscott.

01:01.520 --> 01:02.839
Your team is going down.

01:02.880 --> 01:04.279
ln your dreams, Palumbo.

01:04.319 --> 01:06.675
You've been trying to beat me at
something since the second grade,

01:06.720 --> 01:09.598
and, newsflash, never gonna happen.
Hey, Stinky, how you doing?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.517
Not bad... Hey!

01:11.560 --> 01:14.279
Let's go, ladies. Pick your teams.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.073
You're slower than my husband
in the bathroom.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.510
Curse the day
he put that plasma screen in there.

01:22.760 --> 01:24.990
Pick first, Truscott. You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.553
She's not the one
that's gonna need the help.

01:26.600 --> 01:27.919
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

01:27.960 --> 01:30.155
Darn right, yeah!
You're going down, Phoney Joannie.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.272
-Who smells like week-old bologna.
-That's been in your locker all alone-y.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.709
Right next to that... That...

01:36.200 --> 01:38.316
Melted ice-cream cone-y.

01:39.360 --> 01:41.635
Girl, you are in the zone-y!

01:42.000 --> 01:44.798
Yo, Salt-N-Pepa. You wanna bet on it?

01:44.840 --> 01:45.909
Does she?

01:45.960 --> 01:51.398
How about winning captain gets
to give losing captain a little haircut?

01:53.160 --> 01:54.593
You're on!

01:55.000 --> 01:57.958
Or we could bet a quarter.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.515
'Cause, you know,
it's just about the fun of competition.

02:01.560 --> 02:06.315
No, it's really about the fun of me
kicking your butt again. Yeah.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.315
That's it. You're on!

02:10.360 --> 02:11.509
Go ahead, Lilly.

02:11.560 --> 02:15.189
Pick away, make my day,
everything's gonna be okay...

02:15.240 --> 02:17.754
-Kowalski.
-What'd you say?

02:23.800 --> 02:27.793
Wow. lsn't it funny how it always
comes down to the two of us?

02:28.400 --> 02:30.072
Yeah, hilarious.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.636
l hope you don't get picked last
this time.

02:32.680 --> 02:34.352
Yeah, me, too!

02:36.120 --> 02:38.873
Careful, you almost hit that anthill.

02:38.920 --> 02:43.152
And even these tiny creatures
are very important to our ecosystem.

02:44.200 --> 02:48.273
Pick your poison, Truscott.
You're getting a buzz cut either way.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.433
l pick

02:51.760 --> 02:52.795
Sarah.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.915
Good luck, Stinky. Bye!

04:24.600 --> 04:25.669
Let's get out of here.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.349
Hey, darling, you still upset about
what happened with you and Lilly?

04:29.400 --> 04:31.391
No, of course not.
Why would you say that?

04:31.440 --> 04:33.590
Well, you normally
don't introduce <i>True Friend</i>

04:33.640 --> 04:37.349
as a touching little song
about a two-faced backstabber.

04:38.200 --> 04:42.113
Just my way of keeping things fresh.
You know, l'm an artist, that's what l do.

04:42.160 --> 04:45.869
Well, l'm a dad, and knowing that
that's a hunk of hooey, that's what l do.

04:45.920 --> 04:47.911
Am l gonna get another lecture?

04:47.960 --> 04:51.191
Maybe later. Right now,
l gotta get this dang moustache off.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.073
Lola, be thankful you don't have
to wear one of these things.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.556
lt's itchier than a baboon's butt
at a flea circus.

04:58.280 --> 04:59.872
Well, look who showed up.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.797
Were all the other concerts in town
sold out?

05:01.840 --> 05:04.434
Because l know
you wouldn't have picked mine first.

05:04.480 --> 05:06.550
Or second. Or last!

05:06.600 --> 05:10.036
Hey, l was gonna pick you until
you started that whole haircut thing.

05:10.080 --> 05:14.790
And what's the big deal, anyway?
l won! Do you wanna share the trophy?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.400
l couldn't have done it
without your three fumbles.

05:17.440 --> 05:21.228
lt's a stupid game!
The ball's not even round.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.713
Hannah!

05:25.320 --> 05:27.231
Hey, guys! What's up, Traci?

05:27.280 --> 05:30.352
You just get better and better!

05:30.400 --> 05:34.313
l loved the little backstabbing quip.
So funny!

05:34.360 --> 05:36.271
That wasn't about me, was it?

05:36.320 --> 05:41.838
No, no, no, no. Of course not.
l know l can always count on you.

05:41.880 --> 05:44.314
Come on. You're not going
to stay mad at me forever, are you?

05:44.360 --> 05:46.749
l think l'm a little more mature
than that.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.711
So l have five seats left in the limo.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.311
So l pick you, you, you,

05:53.360 --> 05:57.956
and you. Let's go.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.230
Wait, that's only four.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.554
Right. l forgot about Fern.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.672
-Who's Fern?
-My new best friend.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.110
-That's a ficus!
-A ficus named Fern.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.799
She's getting the window seat. Yeah.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.837
Jackson!

06:37.880 --> 06:40.952
What? l'm eating over the sink.

06:41.480 --> 06:44.950
That's not a sink,
it's a toxic waste dump.

06:45.000 --> 06:48.754
l've asked you for three days
to get these dishes done.

06:48.800 --> 06:53.032
Look at this.
This spinach has hair on it.

06:53.080 --> 06:56.152
That's not spinach,
that's a piece of chicken.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.631
Look, Dad, l'll get to it.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.353
When?
When this stuff up and crawls away?

07:01.400 --> 07:04.631
You think it could do that?
'Cause that would be so cool.

07:04.680 --> 07:09.071
That's it. l ask you to do the dishes,
l get green chicken.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.759
l ask you to separate the whites
in the laundry,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.995
and l get green underwear.

07:14.040 --> 07:15.268
Well, what are you worried about?

07:15.320 --> 07:16.799
Nobody's gonna see them,

07:16.840 --> 07:19.559
unless you do that sunrise yoga
out on the deck again.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.431
Talk about your...

07:22.360 --> 07:24.476
lt centres me, boy.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.795
l shouldn't have to tell you things
over and over again, Jackson.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.034
You're not 1 0 years old.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.674
Okay, okay, l'm sorry.

07:33.480 --> 07:34.708
No, you're not.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.877
You're just saying that because
you're afraid l'm going to ground you.

07:37.920 --> 07:41.674
Come on, Dad, l apologised.
You want me to mean it, too?

07:42.240 --> 07:43.559
Yes.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.593
Jackson, l want you to hear me
when l'm talking to you,

07:47.640 --> 07:51.189
but since you never listen, l'm just
not going to waste my breath any more.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.913
What's that supposed to mean?

07:53.960 --> 07:55.279
Dad?

07:58.840 --> 08:01.957
The silent treatment.
That's my punishment?

08:03.080 --> 08:05.753
You're gonna stop telling me
what to do.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.078
Sweet! l mean... l mean...
l mean, that's a very good choice.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.156
Boy, l sure hope l learn!

08:12.200 --> 08:16.113
Even if it takes a week, a month.
You take your time.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.037
This is important.

08:25.040 --> 08:29.079
<i>...the third down about a yard.</i>
<i>Patterson has them out...</i>

08:29.120 --> 08:32.828
Dad, why didn't you tell me
the Titans game started?

08:34.760 --> 08:38.594
Right. Daddy no talkie Jackson.

08:42.039 --> 08:44.270
vince is out of the pocket!

08:44.320 --> 08:45.594
Go, baby, go! Come on!

08:45.640 --> 08:46.914
Oh, no. Look, he broke a tackle!

08:46.960 --> 08:49.349
Come on, come on,
take it to the house, v-dawg!

08:49.400 --> 08:52.517
Go, go, go! Touchdown!

08:53.080 --> 08:56.595
Give it to me! Give it to me!

08:57.640 --> 09:00.279
Come on. Come on!

09:05.840 --> 09:07.159
Hello?

09:07.200 --> 09:10.909
-You're kidding. That's great.
-What's great?

09:10.960 --> 09:14.635
We're tickled pinker
than a pig in a purple prom dress.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.119
We'll be there!

09:17.160 --> 09:19.628
What pig? Dad, why are we tickled?

09:19.680 --> 09:22.592
Hey, Mile! Get out here.
l got some great news!

09:22.640 --> 09:25.757
Okay, now who's acting
like the 1 0-year-old?

09:25.800 --> 09:28.439
l'll tell you who. You! That's who!

09:28.480 --> 09:33.190
You! You, you, you, you...
You little 1 0-year-old. Look at you.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.829
Peek-a-you! Yeah, yeah, it's you! You!

09:38.880 --> 09:41.678
Look at me. l'm a great big 1 0-year-old,

09:41.720 --> 09:44.757
with big sideburns
and 1 0-year-old big...

09:44.800 --> 09:46.756
You... You're the 1 0-year-old! Yeah.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.793
You're the 1 0-year-old!
You're the 1 0-year-old! You're the...

09:53.280 --> 09:55.475
lt's you!

09:58.960 --> 10:00.791
l'd ask why Jackson's gone squirrelly,

10:00.840 --> 10:03.638
but then l'd have to pretend
that l actually care.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.469
-What's the news?
-l just got a call from Nashville.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.239
Guess what single
just won a Silver Boot

10:10.280 --> 10:12.350
for Best Country <i>l</i> Pop crossover?

10:12.400 --> 10:14.755
-<i>True Friend</i> won a Booty?
-You got it!

10:14.800 --> 10:17.917
l can't believe it!
This has always been my dream.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.350
Being on national television
holding my own Booty.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.472
Well, get ready, darling,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.318
because tomorrow night,
live via satellite,

10:26.360 --> 10:28.271
that dream's coming true!

10:28.320 --> 10:30.038
l'm happy for you, baby.

10:30.080 --> 10:32.196
You know it's a night
you'll never forget.

10:32.240 --> 10:35.676
l know l never get tired
of looking at my own Booty.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.829
This is so awesome.
l have got to go tell...

10:40.880 --> 10:42.233
Lilly.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.988
No, l have a lot of other BFFs
l could tell.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.319
Well, BFs.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.790
Okay, fine, Fs.
Would you stop torturing me?

11:06.520 --> 11:10.035
Answer the phone!
lt could be an emergency.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.114
Okay, okay, you wanna play...

11:15.360 --> 11:17.271
You wanna play hardball?

11:17.320 --> 11:21.108
lt's on! Like soy sauce on a wonton!

11:22.080 --> 11:24.116
You're gonna talk to me.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.320
Yo, Zack. Check it out.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.916
Boo-yah.

11:37.080 --> 11:38.877
-Awesome!
-l know.

11:40.440 --> 11:44.558
-Oliver, l have amazing news!
-So do l.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.194
My mom made detective
and gave me her old handcuffs.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.276
Check it out.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.438
Yeah. Great. Terrific. Whatever.

11:51.480 --> 11:57.191
Okay, Hannah won a Silver Boot
for Best Country <i>l</i> Pop crossover.

11:59.680 --> 12:03.514
Why aren't you happy dancing?
Why aren't you happy dancing?

12:03.960 --> 12:08.078
'Cause l'm not a girl,
and guys don't happy dance.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.278
Well, could you at least
act a little more excited?

12:10.320 --> 12:12.356
Well, you weren't excited for me.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.312
You locked your bike with handcuffs!

12:15.360 --> 12:17.157
And it's awesome!

12:18.000 --> 12:19.479
Thank you!

12:21.840 --> 12:24.718
You know, if you want a girl's reaction,
just go make up with Lilly.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.911
l don't need to make up with Lilly.
l have you. Now, come on, let's go.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.350
-Where're we going?
-Hello, to get our nails done.

12:31.880 --> 12:35.555
We... We can't just try
that happy dance thing, you know?

12:36.280 --> 12:38.316
No. Too late. Let's go.

12:43.400 --> 12:45.675
Your mom must be so proud.

12:48.360 --> 12:54.993
So l want it right here, in big letters,
''l hate Dad.''

12:56.000 --> 12:58.594
And put a little barbed wire around it.

12:58.640 --> 13:01.871
Now, you sure you don't want to
check out some of my flower patterns?

13:01.920 --> 13:03.194
Hey, just barb-wire me, baby.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.516
Okay, all right.
l just need some parental consent.

13:06.560 --> 13:07.629
No problem.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.592
Hey, Dad,
if you don't want me to get a tattoo,

13:10.640 --> 13:12.232
you might wanna speak up.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.349
-Jackson!
-Yeah?

13:13.400 --> 13:18.838
That's it. President Andrew ''blank.''
Seven across. This is too easy.

13:19.720 --> 13:23.315
Okay. Arlo, needle me.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.588
Yup, l'm really gonna do it.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.510
Even though
it's dangerous and permanent.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.638
Here it comes.

13:37.880 --> 13:40.235
He's almost breaking skin...

13:40.600 --> 13:43.637
Marmaduke, you are one funny dog.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.836
Hello! About ready
to get marked for life here.

13:48.880 --> 13:52.316
-Hold still!
-Get away from me with that thing!

13:52.360 --> 13:54.874
What kind of a father are you?

13:56.160 --> 13:59.516
Hey, look at that.
Crazy dog thinks he can drive.

14:05.520 --> 14:08.956
You know, the second coat
really made a difference.

14:09.920 --> 14:11.399
l told you.

14:11.440 --> 14:12.759
Oh, my gosh.

14:12.800 --> 14:16.110
Don't you think Richard Bruce
has the most amazing eyes?

14:16.720 --> 14:19.553
l know. And that blue top he's wearing
really makes them pop.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.556
And what am l saying?

14:25.360 --> 14:29.399
-Hey, Oliver, do you wanna go surfing?
-Yes! Because l'm a guy.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.356
And guys wanna surf in deep waters
full of sharks.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.472
You know, big, huge,
nasty guy sharks!

14:37.120 --> 14:38.473
Are you wearing a clear polish?

14:38.520 --> 14:41.239
lt's called ''Buff.'' Like me. Let's go.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.635
Oliver, wait, wait, wait!
You can't go with her.

14:43.680 --> 14:47.150
The awards are tonight,
and you have to help me with my hair.

14:47.200 --> 14:50.431
-l won a Booty.
-Good, you could use one.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.114
How rude. Come on, we're leaving.
And you're coming with me, Oliver.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.994
-No, you're coming with me.
-No, tell her you're my friend.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.032
-Tell her you were my friend first.
-Tell her to pick a new friend.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.878
Okay, guys,
could you please just work this out?

15:03.920 --> 15:06.388
-Stay out of it!
-Stay out of it!

15:11.480 --> 15:13.789
-What...
-What are you doing?

15:13.840 --> 15:15.159
Staying out of it.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.713
v ery funny, Oliver.
Now unlock these things.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.637
No! Not until you guys work this out.

15:18.680 --> 15:23.470
Oliver, l have to be at the studio in
two hours to do a live satellite feed.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.269
Fine.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.791
But if it weren't for your stupid Booty,
this totally would've worked.

15:31.320 --> 15:34.949
-Tell me you didn't lose the key.
-l didn't lose the key.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.230
-Oliver!
-Okay, l lost it.

15:37.280 --> 15:41.398
My mom keeps a spare. l'll just jump
on my bike, go home and get it.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.476
Someone stole my bike.

15:43.520 --> 15:44.635
-Run!
-Fast!

15:44.680 --> 15:46.193
Okay.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.753
-We're doomed.
-Why?

15:47.800 --> 15:49.836
His house is that way.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.639
Yeah.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.954
Hey, hey, hey, Dad!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.831
Hey, hey, do you remember
two years ago

16:07.880 --> 16:09.154
when l spilled that soda

16:09.200 --> 16:12.078
and you told me to clean it up,
and l totally ignored you?

16:12.120 --> 16:13.758
Well, look who's mopping now!

16:13.800 --> 16:16.030
And, look, l did the dishes.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.196
And l cleaned the bathroom,
and l cleaned my room,

16:18.240 --> 16:21.277
and l did the laundry,
and nothing's green.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.515
Plus, l made you this chocolate cake.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.755
Dad, please,
l promise l'll do whatever you ask,

16:25.800 --> 16:27.438
the first time you ask. Second, tops.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.391
Because, l mean, l'm still just a kid,

16:29.440 --> 16:33.558
but l'm a kid who misses the sound
of his daddy's voice. Please.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.949
lt's got pudding in the middle.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.352
-Chocolate or vanilla?
-Actually, it's pistachio...

16:41.760 --> 16:45.719
You talked to me!
You finally talked to me!

16:47.120 --> 16:49.395
That's because
even though l didn't say anything,

16:49.440 --> 16:50.509
you finally heard me.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.472
Yeah, l did. Loud and clear.

16:53.520 --> 16:56.637
Jackson, that's all a parent ever wants.
That and grandkids.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.954
Now?

16:58.760 --> 17:01.320
Don't worry. No rush on that one.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.036
What is taking Oliver so long?

17:08.079 --> 17:11.277
What do you expect? lt's Oliver.
Now would you stop pacing?

17:11.319 --> 17:13.356
-Would you stop sitting?
-No.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.674
Fine!

17:16.720 --> 17:18.994
Man, you owe me an apple.

17:19.640 --> 17:22.551
Would you keep it down?
l'm on the phone!

17:23.119 --> 17:25.349
Hey, Oliver, where are you?

17:26.720 --> 17:30.269
Great. Just meet us down at the studio.

17:30.320 --> 17:32.072
Okay, Oliver has to go down
to the police station

17:32.120 --> 17:34.111
and get the key from his mom,
and l've gotta get ready.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.197
Not until you buy me another apple.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.595
Forget about the apple.
Help me get ready

17:39.640 --> 17:42.154
and you can keep any three
Hannah outfits you want, okay?

17:42.200 --> 17:43.269
-What about shoes?
-One pair.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.311
-Two.
-Nothing ltalian.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.794
Fine.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.112
Okay.
This may be harder than we thought.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.355
-Yeah. Let's go change.
-Okay.

18:00.960 --> 18:04.032
Okay, this is definitely
not an improvement.

18:04.080 --> 18:05.877
Your feet stink!

18:05.920 --> 18:08.388
Yeah? How do you like them now?

18:11.840 --> 18:16.834
lt's a little tight, but l think it may work.
Let's go take a look in the mirror.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.873
Goodness.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.714
Lovely.

18:27.600 --> 18:31.388
Look at that. l knew you two
couldn't stay mad at each other.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.749
Yeah. We're closer than ever.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.036
You wanna tell me how this happened?

18:37.080 --> 18:38.433
Well, Oliver thought that if he put us...

18:38.480 --> 18:41.995
Sweet niblets,
l wish that boy would stop doing that.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.474
Well, none of this would've happened
if you would've just picked me.

18:44.520 --> 18:46.875
Yeah, l am not the one
who gave a limo ride to a plant.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.831
At least
if Fern was playing flag football,

18:48.880 --> 18:49.949
she would've just picked me.

18:50.000 --> 18:53.151
-lt's a ficus!
-Named Fern!

18:53.840 --> 18:57.469
You could not pay me enough money
to be a teenage girl.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.839
-l got the key, l got the key!
-Thank you.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.791
You're live in one minute,
Miss Montana.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.308
Get 'er done, son.
Carrie Underwood is on stage

19:03.360 --> 19:05.510
announcing that Hannah's
won the award right now.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.357
l haven't even thought
about what l'm going to say yet.

19:07.400 --> 19:08.799
Well, lucky for you, l did.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.751
All you gotta to do
is read the TelePrompTer.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.473
Your daddy's thought of everything.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.670
Except the key breaking.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.840
-Uh-oh.
-l hate when he says uh-oh.

19:19.880 --> 19:22.599
Yeah, it's almost as bad
as when he thinks.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.551
-Live in 30 seconds!
-Oh, boy.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.397
Gee, l wonder
what's gonna happen now.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.556
Gee, l wonder
what's gonna happen now.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.669
l have an idea!

19:29.720 --> 19:31.278
-No!
-No!

19:31.320 --> 19:34.357
Normally, l'd agree,
but this is a good one.

19:37.520 --> 19:41.718
<i>Accepting her award, live from</i>
<i>Los Angeles, Hannah Montana.</i>

19:42.360 --> 19:45.591
Thank you so much
for this incredible honour.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.198
And it means even more knowing

19:47.240 --> 19:49.470
that it's coming from
the good folks in Nashville,

19:49.520 --> 19:52.671
the place that l'm proud
to call my hometown.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.476
Hooray, Nashville!

19:56.600 --> 20:01.355
l only wish that l could be there
in person to tell you how l truly feel.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.238
This is my special wave to Grandma.
Hi, Grandma!

20:09.120 --> 20:10.712
Bye, Grandma.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.476
Every time that l hear <i>True Friend,</i>

20:13.520 --> 20:19.868
it always makes me think about...
About real friendship.

20:21.040 --> 20:24.953
Sorry. l had a little something
in my teeth. All better.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.911
As l was saying,
friendship means a lot to me.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.952
ln fact, this song was inspired by my...

20:35.480 --> 20:37.550
My best friend.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.192
She's been with me
through everything,

20:39.240 --> 20:41.959
and even though sometimes we fight,

20:43.000 --> 20:47.551
we know we'll always get through it
because, well, we love each other.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.395
And nothing says it better
than this song.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.192
''True friends will go to the ends
of the earth

20:53.240 --> 20:55.390
''till they find the things you need.

20:55.440 --> 20:57.351
''Friends hang on
through the ups and the downs...''

20:57.400 --> 20:58.913
Bless you.

20:59.880 --> 21:01.916
'''Cause they've got someone
to believe in.''

21:01.960 --> 21:04.838
Thank you for believing in me,
and thank you for this award.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.110
l love you all. Good night.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.550
-l'm sorry!
-Me, too!

21:21.800 --> 21:25.634
Let's go, ladies, pick your teams.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.797
You're slower than my husband
in the bathroom.

21:29.640 --> 21:31.949
-You said that last week.
-l know.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.949
Now he's got a mini-fridge in there.
l think he's hiding from me.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.197
-l could never imagine why.
-Yeah.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.277
Okay, l pick Joannie.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.708
Hey, you could've bet a quarter.

21:58.600 --> 21:59.669
l pick Lilly.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.915
lf you pick me,
you have to pick Miley, too.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.313
l don't want to pick her.

22:03.360 --> 22:08.070
-l don't care. Wherever l go, she goes.
-Yeah, we're kind of a package deal.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.399
Fine. l'll take Lilly and Stinky.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.433
Told you it would work. Now unlock us.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.275
l thought you had the key.

22:20.880 --> 22:23.075
-Man.
-Think fast!
