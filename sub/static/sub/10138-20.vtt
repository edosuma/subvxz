08:14.702 --> 08:18.915
you say, "Whatever?"

08:18.957 --> 08:21.501
I guess.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.044
Deej, don't you get it?

08:23.086 --> 08:25.546
For our prank, we can hoist

08:23.086 --> 08:25.546
old Robolard himself

08:25.588 --> 08:26.923
up the flagpole.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.177
Kimmy, the idea

08:28.216 --> 08:30.177
of the prank is not to let

08:30.218 --> 08:31.970
Robolard know who's doing it.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.638
I mean, he might

08:32.012 --> 08:33.638
get suspicious when he sees us

08:33.680 --> 08:36.641
putting a big hook

08:33.680 --> 08:36.641
in his pants.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.601
Are you gonna be a wimp

08:36.683 --> 08:38.601
your whole life?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.061
Don't you wanna do

08:38.643 --> 08:40.061
something wild

08:40.103 --> 08:42.439
and unforgettable

08:40.103 --> 08:42.439
like your Uncle Jesse?

08:42.481 --> 08:45.817
- Of course, but--

08:42.481 --> 08:45.817
- Well, we have a crane.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.402
We have Duane.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.529
We have your brain.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.157
Hey, that almost rhymes.

08:52.199 --> 08:55.118
Ha! I guess.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.536
Come on, Deej.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.912
This could be a classic.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.999
A classic?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.959
That gives me an idea.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.090
[rattling]

09:11.343 --> 09:13.594
Okay, Duane, a little

09:11.343 --> 09:13.594
to the left!

09:17.015 --> 09:19.226
'The left!'

09:19.267 --> 09:21.853
Your left!

09:21.895 --> 09:24.272
The hot water side!

09:25.315 --> 09:27.359
[crowd applauding]

09:27.401 --> 09:29.777
'Good. Now ease it down gently.'

09:35.450 --> 09:36.951
[crowd cheering]

09:36.993 --> 09:38.412
Yes, oh!

09:38.453 --> 09:40.705
What I would give

09:38.453 --> 09:40.705
to see Robolard's face tonight

09:40.747 --> 09:42.499
when he gets back

09:40.747 --> 09:42.499
from the away game.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.084
Yeah.

09:42.541 --> 09:44.084
And his precious car's missing

09:44.125 --> 09:45.710
from its covered parking spot.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.213
This is the senior prank

09:45.752 --> 09:48.213
no one will forget.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.506
What about your Uncle Jesse's?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.883
Uncle who?

09:54.802 --> 09:55.929
Whew.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.223
Well, what do you think?

09:58.265 --> 10:00.767
You're a good cook, mama.

10:00.808 --> 10:02.852
Yeah. Who knew?

10:04.896 --> 10:06.606
Beck, that was really delicious.

10:06.647 --> 10:09.067
I--I'm amazed. Who knew?

10:10.569 --> 10:13.029
Should I consider that

10:10.569 --> 10:13.029
an apology or a compliment?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.323
- Both.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.323
- Thanks.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.702
Whew, man, am I bloated.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.459
That is about a four-notcher

10:22.789 --> 10:25.459
on the old belt.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.668
Let me tell you.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.923
Should I consider that

10:27.710 --> 10:31.923
an apology or a compliment?

10:31.965 --> 10:34.675
You should consider that

10:31.965 --> 10:34.675
a reason to stay single.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.597
Do we have enough left for DJ?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.308
Oh, I don't think

10:38.638 --> 10:41.308
she'll go hungry.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.690
Beck, that's not a meatloaf.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.360
Th-that's a meat-mountain.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.154
Well I forgot to take

10:52.402 --> 10:54.154
into consideration

10:54.195 --> 10:56.573
that grandma's recipe was

10:54.195 --> 10:56.573
for the whole trailer park.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.868
Anyone else want

10:58.866 --> 11:00.868
a piece of the rock?

11:00.910 --> 11:02.329
- No, no

11:00.910 --> 11:02.329
- No, thank you.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.165
[barks]

11:05.206 --> 11:08.126
Oh, well, I think

11:05.206 --> 11:08.126
that we can spare a little.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.420
Will you be eating that here,

11:08.168 --> 11:10.420
or would you like a doggie bag?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.217
Hey, Beck, listen,

11:14.090 --> 11:16.217
since I teased you so much

11:16.259 --> 11:18.386
about your cooking,

11:16.259 --> 11:18.386
I volunteer to do the dishes.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.180
Oh, thanks, honey.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.180
That's really sweet of you.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.931
- You are. You're very sweet.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.931
- That's is very sweet.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.017
Wait, wait. I wasn't

11:21.973 --> 11:24.017
the only one who teased her.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.935
How about some

11:24.058 --> 11:25.935
other volunteers, please?

11:28.687 --> 11:30.940
Hey! Hey, boys. Boys.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.400
How about a hand?

11:32.442 --> 11:34.235
[clapping]

11:34.277 --> 11:36.154
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

11:34.277 --> 11:36.154
that's an old joke.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.406
New to us.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.783
[laughing]

11:42.701 --> 11:44.204
Uncle Jesse, we did it.

11:44.245 --> 11:46.164
We pulled off

11:44.245 --> 11:46.164
the greatest prank ever.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.792
Yeah, this is way better

11:46.206 --> 11:49.792
than your toupee on a stick.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.710
Well, I way doubt that.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.710
But let's hear it.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.464
We got a crane

11:51.752 --> 11:54.464
and lifted Robolard's car

11:54.506 --> 11:55.840
onto the roof of the school.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.010
I always knew one day

11:59.052 --> 12:01.513
some crazy devil-may-care maniac

12:01.555 --> 12:03.682
would surpass my prank.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.309
I'm proud to call

12:03.722 --> 12:06.309
that maniac my niece.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.602
Hug me.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.813
Uncle Jesse,

12:08.936 --> 12:10.813
it was unbelievable.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.316
Robolard is gonna freak out.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.026
Do you think Duane will talk?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.695
He doesn't even talk to me.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.113
What a prank.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.533
It was unbelievable.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.533
It was outrageous.

12:21.575 --> 12:25.579
Everything went off perfectly.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.581
It's a good thing you guys got

12:25.620 --> 12:27.581
that prank done in time.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.748
Looks like it's gonna pour

12:27.622 --> 12:29.748
any minute out there.

12:29.790 --> 12:30.958
Oh, my gosh.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.712
Kimmy, Robolard's car's

12:31.000 --> 12:33.712
on the roof.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.631
I know. I can't

12:33.752 --> 12:36.631
get over it either.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.007
With the top down.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.801
Kimmy, the interior's

12:38.049 --> 12:40.801
gonna be destroyed.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.680
This prank is turning out

12:40.843 --> 12:43.680
to be great.

12:43.722 --> 12:45.265
Kimmy, the idea

12:43.722 --> 12:45.265
of the prank was not

12:45.306 --> 12:47.475
to ruin his car,

12:45.306 --> 12:47.475
just ruin his day.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.810
Well, we've got to get back

12:47.517 --> 12:49.810
there and put the top up.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
Wait. We-we can't.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.313
It's an automatic top.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.524
And we'd need the keys.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.524
We're dead.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.942
Well, maybe not yet,

12:54.566 --> 12:55.942
you know what

12:55.983 --> 12:57.485
I can hot-wire the car,

12:55.983 --> 12:57.485
but we got to hurry.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.153
Great.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.531
How did you learn

12:59.195 --> 13:01.531
how to hot-wire a car?

13:01.573 --> 13:04.200
Uh, science project.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.078
[thunder]

13:11.625 --> 13:14.586
[thunder]

13:14.628 --> 13:17.464
Uncle Jesse, hurry up.

13:14.628 --> 13:17.464
I-I think I felt a raindrop.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.007
Just one minute here.

13:17.505 --> 13:20.007
Let me just..

13:20.049 --> 13:21.342
[engine rumbling]

13:21.384 --> 13:23.177
There it is.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.597
Ha! Kid's still got it.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.140
Thanks, Uncle Jesse.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.892
I'm sorry I ever did this.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.270
Hey, hey, hey!

13:29.934 --> 13:32.270
The security guard's coming.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.564
Now I'm really sorry.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.564
Wh-what are we gonna do?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.733
You guys Hide. I'll take care

13:34.606 --> 13:36.733
of the security guard.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.234
- What about you?

13:36.775 --> 13:38.234
- Don't worry about me.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.818
If you get caught,

13:38.276 --> 13:39.818
you're not gonna graduate.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.780
You won't be gettin' a college.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.780
Now go hide.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.079
Hey, what's going on out here?

13:50.121 --> 13:52.457
What the..

14:01.048 --> 14:03.134
What are you doing there?

14:03.176 --> 14:06.387
Uh, well, I got tired,

14:03.176 --> 14:06.387
so I pulled over.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.224
Oh. Okay.

14:10.266 --> 14:11.392
So, get some rest.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.019
Okay. Thanks.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.605
What? Wait a minute.

14:15.647 --> 14:19.108
This is Principal

14:15.647 --> 14:19.108
Robolard's car.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.737
Uh, so it is. So it is.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.947
Yeah, oh, you know.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.947
That's right. I forgot.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.700
I parked mine on top of the gym.

14:26.741 --> 14:29.410
Well, listen, Have a nice night.

14:26.741 --> 14:29.410
Looks like rain. We'll see you

14:29.452 --> 14:32.580
Hold it. You're coming with me.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.582
Come on, it was just

14:32.622 --> 14:34.582
a little prank.

14:34.624 --> 14:36.376
Where's your sense of humor?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.795
Apparently you had it surgically

14:36.417 --> 14:38.795
removed at a young age.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.425
Kimmy, this whole thing

14:42.716 --> 14:44.425
was our idea.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.886
We can't let Uncle Jesse

14:44.467 --> 14:46.886
take the blame for it.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.263
Well, he doesn't want you

14:46.927 --> 14:49.263
to take the blame.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.932
You'll be kicked out of school.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.932
You won't go to college.

14:51.974 --> 14:54.435
Everything you've ever worked

14:51.974 --> 14:54.435
for will go down the drain.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.937
What are they gonna do to him?

14:56.979 --> 14:58.732
Shave his head,

14:56.979 --> 14:58.732
toss him in the clink

14:58.773 --> 15:01.067
and make him listen

14:58.773 --> 15:01.067
to his own singing.

15:01.108 --> 15:03.986
Poor sap. Oh, well,

15:01.108 --> 15:03.986
let's go grab a burger.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.534
[instrumental music]

15:12.579 --> 15:14.539
Becky, I can't believe

15:12.579 --> 15:14.539
how good that dinner was.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.166
If there was an Oscar

15:14.581 --> 15:17.166
for cooking

15:17.208 --> 15:20.961
I think you'd win

15:17.208 --> 15:20.961
best performance by a loaf.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.381
[laughs]

15:21.003 --> 15:23.381
You're very kind.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.341
I'd like to thank

15:23.423 --> 15:25.341
all the little people.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.468
That would be me.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.138
Dad, I think Comet's sick.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.767
- What makes you say that?

15:31.180 --> 15:33.767
- Oh, I don't know.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.142
Something about the way he just

15:35.184 --> 15:37.562
tossed his biscuits

15:35.184 --> 15:37.562
all over the rose bush.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.025
- You okay, fella?

15:40.440 --> 15:43.025
- He was fine at dinner.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.152
I mean, he really

15:43.067 --> 15:45.152
wolfed down that meatloaf.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.615
The meatloaf.

15:48.656 --> 15:50.700
Hey, there's nothing

15:48.656 --> 15:50.700
wrong with that meatloaf.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.243
It just won an Oscar.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.622
Oh, no, Comet drinks out

15:53.411 --> 15:55.622
of the toilet.

15:55.663 --> 15:57.415
If the meatloaf's

15:55.663 --> 15:57.415
making him sick

15:57.457 --> 15:59.333
it's gonna kill us.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.670
You know what? I'm, uh..

16:02.712 --> 16:05.089
...I'm actually starting

16:02.712 --> 16:05.089
to feel little queasy myself.

16:05.131 --> 16:07.717
Yeah. I feel

16:05.131 --> 16:07.717
like I swallowed a brick.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.303
My stomach's getting all gurgly.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.222
Oh, Come on, you guys.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.222
This is totally psychosomatic.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.475
- It's all in your heads.

16:13.264 --> 16:15.475
- Yeah, for now it is.

16:15.516 --> 16:18.144
But pretty soon it's gonna be

16:15.516 --> 16:18.144
all over that rose bush.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.022
Mom, we feel bad.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.651
Psychosomatic, huh?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.736
Nicky, Alex,

16:24.692 --> 16:26.736
do your tummies hurt?

16:26.778 --> 16:27.946
No.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.238
Well, then what's wrong?

16:29.280 --> 16:32.158
Someone took all

16:29.280 --> 16:32.158
our silly dough.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.786
They did?

16:34.828 --> 16:37.580
This is all that's left.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.248
Let me see that.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.210
Well, there are

16:40.917 --> 16:43.210
teeth marks all over it

16:43.252 --> 16:45.546
and slobber..

16:45.588 --> 16:47.924
...and a blond hair.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.550
Joey.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.513
A-ha. Blue teeth.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.224
Blue paws.

16:57.266 --> 16:59.686
Well, either Comet ate

16:57.266 --> 16:59.686
the silly dough

16:59.727 --> 17:01.604
or he's been out

16:59.727 --> 17:01.604
chasing Smurfs.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.732
Is he gonna be okay?

17:04.774 --> 17:06.359
Comet's gonna be just fine.

17:06.400 --> 17:10.864
Silly dough is non-toxic

17:06.400 --> 17:10.864
and 100% natural.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.492
Huh? Come here, boy. Yeah.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.077
Yeah. See that? He's starting

17:14.534 --> 17:17.077
to feel better already.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.079
Ooh, you could use

17:17.119 --> 17:19.079
a little doggie mint.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.290
Peeyoo!

17:21.332 --> 17:22.625
Come on, Comet.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.464
And you guys were worried

17:25.962 --> 17:28.464
about the meatloaf.

17:28.506 --> 17:32.134
Uh, dad, you were the one

17:28.506 --> 17:32.134
who said you felt queasy.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.511
Yeah, but you know what it was..

17:33.553 --> 17:35.221
I think it was

17:33.553 --> 17:35.221
that game of sorry.

17:35.262 --> 17:39.183
Th-the tension,

17:35.262 --> 17:39.183
it was gut-wrenching.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.227
How come everybody else

17:39.225 --> 17:41.227
felt sick?

17:41.268 --> 17:43.855
Well, sometimes your mind

17:41.268 --> 17:43.855
can play tricks on you.

17:43.897 --> 17:45.565
And if you believe

17:43.897 --> 17:45.565
something strong enough

17:45.606 --> 17:46.858
you can make it happen.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.985
- Cool.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.985
- What cool?

17:49.027 --> 17:52.112
I believe you're

17:49.027 --> 17:52.112
gonna raise my allowance.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.036
This thing is ludicrous.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.371
It's a travesty.

18:00.413 --> 18:01.581
Just, uh, raise your hand

18:01.622 --> 18:03.708
when I get to a word

18:01.622 --> 18:03.708
"You recognize."

18:10.006 --> 18:11.507
That's him, Mr. Robolard.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.967
You!

18:13.009 --> 18:14.093
Me.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.345
Jesse Katsopolis.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.556
What a long overdue pleasure.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.975
Robolardo.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.102
I mean, Mr. Robolard.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.478
Long time no see.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.647
Hm. Uh..

18:26.689 --> 18:29.191
Not since the flagpole

18:26.689 --> 18:29.191
incident, I believe.

18:29.233 --> 18:32.445
I-I-I don't know

18:29.233 --> 18:32.445
what you're talking about.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.571
I think you do.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.864
And This time I got you.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.909
You put my car on the roof.

18:37.951 --> 18:39.285
Come on, Robolard,

18:37.951 --> 18:39.285
it was a joke.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.037
What're you gonna do,

18:39.326 --> 18:41.037
call my parents

18:41.079 --> 18:43.163
put me on detention,

18:41.079 --> 18:43.163
make me write 500 times

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
"I will not put

18:43.205 --> 18:45.374
a car on the roof?"

18:46.250 --> 18:47.376
See you, Robo.

18:47.418 --> 18:49.211
Uh, uh, but-but, Mr. Katsopolis

18:49.253 --> 18:50.254
the only way you're leaving here

18:50.296 --> 18:51.798
is in the back of a police car.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.258
Police? Why?

18:54.300 --> 18:57.177
Um, trespassing,

18:54.300 --> 18:57.177
breaking-and-entering

18:57.219 --> 18:59.430
uh, grand theft auto.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.430
Ha!

18:59.472 --> 19:01.724
I didn't thieve it.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.724
I just lifted it.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.644
Okay, grand lift auto.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.771
Either way, you're going

19:04.685 --> 19:06.771
where you belong

19:07.855 --> 19:10.149
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Robolard.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.151
D.J. Tanner, what are

19:10.190 --> 19:12.151
you doing here?

19:12.192 --> 19:15.029
Mr. Robolard, th-this whole

19:12.192 --> 19:15.029
thing was my stupid idea.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.197
I'm the one who put your car

19:15.071 --> 19:17.197
on the roof.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.200
No, no, no.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.200
That didn't happen.

19:20.242 --> 19:24.204
She-she's just a wacky,

19:20.242 --> 19:24.204
crazy, college-bound student

19:24.246 --> 19:26.916
who's trying to ruin her future

19:24.246 --> 19:26.916
before she even gets there.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.042
Go ahead, I'm to blame.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.919
1-800-book-him. Go ahead.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.007
Uncle Jesse, it's okay.

19:31.337 --> 19:34.007
It's my responsibility.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.842
Oh, Deej, come on. Please.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.719
Even Robolard doesn't believe

19:35.883 --> 19:38.719
you'd do something that crazy.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.221
Mr. Robolard, why would

19:38.761 --> 19:41.221
I be here in your office

19:41.263 --> 19:43.223
at night if I weren't

19:41.263 --> 19:43.223
involved in this?

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
Uh, see, she's taking

19:43.265 --> 19:46.602
this remedial, uh, shop class

19:46.644 --> 19:49.147
with old three fingers Magee.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.941
Mr. Katsopolis, that class

19:49.188 --> 19:51.941
is no longer offered at night

19:51.983 --> 19:54.902
and since you left school,

19:51.983 --> 19:54.902
it's two fingers Magee.

19:57.155 --> 20:00.199
Guess he never got

19:57.155 --> 20:00.199
the hang of the jigsaw.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.742
D.J., I still can't believe

20:00.240 --> 20:01.742
you're involved

20:01.784 --> 20:02.910
in a prank like this.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.956
Well, she isn't.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.956
This is all my fault, okay.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.834
I kept pushing her and goading

20:06.998 --> 20:09.834
her to do something outrageous.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.169
I mean, if it was up to her,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.169
she would've just said

20:11.210 --> 20:13.587
you Xeroxed your butt.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.131
Look, I'm responsible

20:13.629 --> 20:15.131
here, okay.

20:15.173 --> 20:17.175
So call the police,

20:15.173 --> 20:17.175
go ahead, book me.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.425
I'll see you

20:17.216 --> 20:18.425
on visitor's day. Come on.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.095
No. look, the truth

20:18.467 --> 20:21.095
is Mr. Robolard

20:21.137 --> 20:23.472
the only reason my uncle's here

20:21.137 --> 20:23.472
was to help me.

20:23.514 --> 20:24.682
I mean, if it weren't for him

20:24.724 --> 20:26.726
the rain would've

20:24.724 --> 20:26.726
ruined your car.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.603
That's how we got the top up,

20:26.767 --> 20:29.603
he hot-wired the ignition.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.484
- It's a science project.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.484
- Oh.

20:35.526 --> 20:38.029
So if anyone should be punished,

20:35.526 --> 20:38.029
it should be me.

20:38.071 --> 20:42.200
D.J., you had

20:38.071 --> 20:42.200
such a bright future.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.534
Why'd you do it?

20:43.576 --> 20:46.204
Because...I wanted

20:43.576 --> 20:46.204
to leave a legacy

20:47.287 --> 20:50.166
you know,

20:47.287 --> 20:50.166
do something outrageous.

20:50.208 --> 20:51.792
I guess for once in my life

20:51.834 --> 20:54.461
I just wanted to show everyone

20:51.834 --> 20:54.461
that I had guts.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.882
Well, you did, Deej.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.800
Coming in here,

20:57.924 --> 20:59.800
sticking up for me

20:59.842 --> 21:01.010
takin' the responsibility

21:01.052 --> 21:02.469
that's about as gutsy

21:01.052 --> 21:02.469
as it gets.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.304
And as brilliant.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.724
That was the best prank

21:04.346 --> 21:06.724
in the history of the school.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.060
Really?

21:10.519 --> 21:12.271
I thought you hated

21:10.519 --> 21:12.271
senior pranks.

21:12.312 --> 21:14.356
Well, the kids

21:12.312 --> 21:14.356
expect me to say that.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.816
I mean, what good is a prank

21:15.858 --> 21:18.485
if you think

21:15.858 --> 21:18.485
the principal approves?

21:20.446 --> 21:21.906
So I'm not in trouble?

21:22.322 --> 21:24.742
No.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.994
Uh, as long as you keep

21:24.784 --> 21:26.994
a straight face tomorrow

21:27.036 --> 21:28.246
when I chew out

21:27.036 --> 21:28.246
the senior class

21:28.287 --> 21:30.706
for this heinous

21:28.287 --> 21:30.706
and outrageous crime

21:30.748 --> 21:33.709
against authority.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.630
- Deal.

21:33.751 --> 21:37.630
- Uh, uh, hold it a second here.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.132
Now, how come when you thought

21:39.173 --> 21:41.008
I did the prank you were gonna

21:39.173 --> 21:41.008
send me to jail?

21:41.050 --> 21:42.426
- Well, there's a good reason.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.426
- Oh, yeah, what's that?

21:42.468 --> 21:44.678
- I never liked you.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.678
- See. He never..

21:45.471 --> 21:46.597
Why?

21:46.639 --> 21:47.848
'Cause you had

21:46.639 --> 21:47.848
the hair I wanted

21:47.890 --> 21:49.850
since I was

21:47.890 --> 21:49.850
a balding boy scout.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.729
And your hair's

21:51.602 --> 21:53.729
even gotten better

21:53.771 --> 21:55.731
while I've been

21:53.771 --> 21:55.731
stuck with this.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.026
Oh, my..

21:56.774 --> 21:59.026
It's a wig.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.240
Mr. Robolard, it wasn't D.J.

22:01.612 --> 22:04.240
who did this.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.325
Kimmy, you-you don't

22:04.282 --> 22:06.325
have to take the rap for this.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.619
I'm not. I have

22:06.366 --> 22:08.619
the culprit right here.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.125
Duane?

22:14.167 --> 22:15.709
