WEBVTT

00:02.084 --> 00:03.885
So, we're about to shoot
this scene in the movie

00:03.887 --> 00:07.155
where the killer ape DNA
is slowly taking over my body.

00:07.157 --> 00:08.456
Okay.

00:08.458 --> 00:11.059
But I realize
they're gluing fur everywhere,

00:11.061 --> 00:12.193
except my cleavage.

00:12.195 --> 00:14.095
So, I asked
the director why

00:14.097 --> 00:16.364
and he says, it's important
to the story that my boobs

00:16.366 --> 00:18.833
be the last things to turn ape.

00:21.504 --> 00:24.506
It's sweet that he thinks
there's a story.

00:24.508 --> 00:27.141
Oh, and there's not even
a bathroom on set.

00:27.143 --> 00:29.410
I have to go to the gas station
across the street.

00:29.412 --> 00:31.346
I mean, I was dressed like
half an ape

00:31.348 --> 00:34.408
and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

00:35.505 --> 00:37.163
Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

00:37.188 --> 00:38.387
Sure. What's up?

00:38.388 --> 00:39.988
Well, now that I've given up
string theory,

00:39.990 --> 00:42.323
I'm struggling to find
my next area of focus.

00:42.325 --> 00:44.459
So, in your
professional opinion,

00:44.461 --> 00:46.327
which of these areas
do you think

00:46.329 --> 00:47.428
is the most promising?

00:47.430 --> 00:49.697
Huh, well, I-I think
there's some

00:49.699 --> 00:52.133
really innovative stuff
going on in dark matter.

00:52.135 --> 00:53.801
That's helpful.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.540
Okay. Of these four areas...

00:58.542 --> 00:59.674
PENNY:
Sheldon!

00:59.676 --> 01:01.376
What did we say about
being a nicer friend?

01:01.378 --> 01:02.777
Thank you.

01:02.779 --> 01:05.880
Leonard, what did we say about
being a gullible weenie?

01:07.182 --> 01:09.017
It is just so frustrating.
PENNY: 'Cause you're

01:09.019 --> 01:10.618
trying too hard.
You need to do something else.

01:10.620 --> 01:11.920
Get your mind off it.

01:11.922 --> 01:15.390
Hey. How about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

01:15.392 --> 01:17.025
Hey, that's good.
Why'd you guys stop doing that?

01:17.027 --> 01:19.260
You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

01:20.229 --> 01:21.696
Yeah. Sounds like me.

01:22.665 --> 01:23.932
Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

01:23.934 --> 01:26.834
All right.
I officially reinstate

01:26.836 --> 01:28.169
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.138
Great! What do,
what do you want to do?

01:30.140 --> 01:31.472
(Sheldon and Penny sigh)

01:31.474 --> 01:32.840
I don't know.

01:32.842 --> 01:34.042
What do you want to do?

01:34.044 --> 01:36.144
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

01:36.146 --> 01:38.713
I'm starting to remember
the problem with

01:38.715 --> 01:40.248

02:10.453 --> 02:12.187
Hmm...

02:12.189 --> 02:14.689
what could we do that's fun?

02:14.691 --> 02:16.558
What could we do
that's different?

02:16.560 --> 02:19.928
What could we do that's free?

02:21.130 --> 02:22.431
(gasps) Got it!

02:22.433 --> 02:24.499
We order a pizza.

02:24.501 --> 02:26.334
Are you kidding?
That's what you always do.

02:26.336 --> 02:27.302
Think harder.

02:27.304 --> 02:29.304
You're right.
You're right.

02:29.306 --> 02:30.439
(gasps) Got it!

02:30.441 --> 02:33.075
We order calzones,
cut them open,

02:33.077 --> 02:35.143
eat them like pizza.

02:36.245 --> 02:37.679
All right! All right!
I'll shake the brain bush

02:37.681 --> 02:39.414
one more time,
see what falls out.

02:40.483 --> 02:41.650
(gasps) Got it!

02:41.652 --> 02:44.286
There's a live-action
role-playing group

02:44.288 --> 02:46.021
that meets every Thursday night
in Griffith Park

02:46.023 --> 02:49.257
and reenacts battles from
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

02:49.259 --> 02:52.894
Uh, tell me more
about this calzone idea.

02:54.063 --> 02:55.163
You know what?

02:55.165 --> 02:56.498
Why don't we just
ease into this.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.999
Let-Let's go for a walk

02:58.001 --> 03:00.635
and-and-and see if
we find a new restaurant.

03:00.637 --> 03:04.106
Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

03:06.676 --> 03:07.843
LEONARD:
No.

03:07.845 --> 03:10.378
All right.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.447
Raj and Howard
are at Howard's mom's,

03:12.449 --> 03:14.282
but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

03:14.284 --> 03:15.650
No. Bernadette's
working late.

03:15.652 --> 03:16.818
Amy's sick.

03:16.820 --> 03:17.886
Aw. What's wrong with her?

03:17.888 --> 03:19.454
Well, she talks a lot.

03:19.456 --> 03:21.356
She always wants to hold hands.

03:21.358 --> 03:23.058
That's not what I meant.

03:23.060 --> 03:24.926
Well, if you were
referring to her illness

03:24.928 --> 03:26.928
your question should have been,
"What ails her?"

03:28.498 --> 03:29.464
"What ails her?"

03:29.466 --> 03:31.399
Oh. Who knows?

03:33.102 --> 03:34.402
Come on,
anything can happen.

03:34.404 --> 03:36.338
We can push him
down the stairs!

03:38.808 --> 03:40.909
Hey. Thanks for
coming to hang out.

03:40.911 --> 03:42.911
No problem.
How's your mom feeling?

03:42.913 --> 03:46.448
Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

03:46.450 --> 03:48.450
You know, when Cinnamon
won't take her medicine,

03:48.452 --> 03:50.152
I hide it in a piece of cheese.

03:50.154 --> 03:51.987
Good idea.
We can wrap the pill in cheese,

03:51.989 --> 03:53.021
feed it to Cinnamon,

03:53.023 --> 03:54.689
and then my mom
can eat Cinnamon.

03:57.827 --> 03:59.027
What do you feel like doing?

03:59.029 --> 04:01.029
I was thinking
we could watch a DVD.

04:01.031 --> 04:02.230
Well, (sighs)

04:02.232 --> 04:04.766
my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

04:04.768 --> 04:08.236
Unless you want to watch
the video of her colonoscopy.

04:10.006 --> 04:11.306
Spoiler alert:
20 minutes in,

04:11.308 --> 04:12.674
they find a prune pit.

04:12.676 --> 04:18.980
Actually, how do you feel about
watching <i>House of 1000 Corpses?</i>

04:18.982 --> 04:21.483
(scoffs)
A straight-up gore-fest?

04:21.485 --> 04:22.517
You hate this stuff.

04:22.519 --> 04:24.452
I do, but for some reason,
Emily loves it

04:24.454 --> 04:26.354
and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow, so...

04:26.356 --> 04:27.556
I thought if
I start with you first,

04:27.558 --> 04:30.258
then I could act cool
about it with her.

04:30.260 --> 04:32.427
That's actually
not a bad plan.

04:32.429 --> 04:34.029
I can sit through
the colonoscopy now,

04:34.031 --> 04:35.497
but that first time
I was like,

04:35.499 --> 04:38.033
"Oh, My God, a prune pit!"

04:42.772 --> 04:44.206
Uh, so... you'd watch it?

04:44.208 --> 04:45.373
Sure.
(sighs)

04:45.375 --> 04:46.841
You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

04:46.843 --> 04:48.310
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard!

04:48.312 --> 04:50.212
Help me get out of the tub!

04:54.417 --> 04:56.084
Not that one.

04:59.622 --> 05:02.090
So, we're just randomly
choosing a restaurant

05:02.092 --> 05:03.525
without researching it online?

05:03.527 --> 05:04.359
Yep.

05:04.361 --> 05:05.927
Great.

05:05.929 --> 05:08.430
You know, this is how Anything
Can Happen Thursday turns into

05:08.432 --> 05:10.165
It Won't Stop Coming Up Friday.

05:11.968 --> 05:15.570
Hey, how about
that Asian fusion place?

05:15.572 --> 05:18.173
Fusion and Asians?

05:18.175 --> 05:21.443
I'm trying not to
think about science.

05:21.445 --> 05:23.545
What the hell?

05:25.114 --> 05:26.047
What...?

05:26.049 --> 05:27.382
She's not working late!

05:28.317 --> 05:30.685
And Amy doesn't
look sick.

05:30.687 --> 05:32.153
Why would they
lie to us?

05:32.155 --> 05:33.455
That's a good question.

05:33.457 --> 05:34.556
(knocking)

05:34.558 --> 05:35.423
Amy and Bernadette.

05:35.425 --> 05:36.324
(knocking)

05:36.326 --> 05:37.726
Amy and Bernadette.
(knocking)

05:37.728 --> 05:39.060
Amy and Bernadette.

05:39.062 --> 05:41.696
Why did you lie to us?!

05:44.333 --> 05:47.135
Hey. Listen to this:

05:47.137 --> 05:49.738
"Murder... cannibalism

05:49.740 --> 05:51.273
"and satanic rituals

05:51.275 --> 05:52.407
"are just a few

05:52.409 --> 05:55.076
of the thousand plus
horrors that await."

05:55.078 --> 05:57.145
I just helped my mom
out of the tub,

05:57.147 --> 05:59.848
so, I'm one slippery horror
ahead of you.

05:59.850 --> 06:01.049
You're a good son.

06:01.051 --> 06:03.285
I don't know how you do it.

06:03.287 --> 06:05.020
Beach blankets,
my friend.

06:05.022 --> 06:06.721
It's all about
beach blankets.

06:06.723 --> 06:10.158
All right,
let's get this over with.

06:10.160 --> 06:13.595
Ew, it's got
someone's hair on it!

06:13.597 --> 06:15.330
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

06:15.332 --> 06:16.731
(blows)

06:19.969 --> 06:22.671
You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

06:22.673 --> 06:24.939
And Amy, you told me
you were sick,

06:24.941 --> 06:27.842
but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

06:29.412 --> 06:31.179
I'm sorry.
I just needed a break

06:31.181 --> 06:34.182
from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

06:34.184 --> 06:36.351
And we kind of just
wanted one night

06:36.353 --> 06:38.720
where we didn't have to hear
about how miserable you are

06:38.722 --> 06:40.455
making this movie.

06:40.457 --> 06:42.557
But none of that means
we don't love you.

06:42.559 --> 06:45.193
I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

06:45.195 --> 06:47.762
Have I?

06:48.664 --> 06:50.031
I also love you.

06:53.436 --> 06:54.736
You know what?

06:54.738 --> 06:56.538
Maybe I need a break from
all of you.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.773
Come on, Sheldon.

06:58.775 --> 06:59.614
Where are we going?

06:59.639 --> 07:01.577
We're gonna have Anything Can
Happen Thursday, you're gonna

07:01.578 --> 07:03.545
tell me all about your science
stuff and I'm gonna complain

07:03.547 --> 07:05.280
about my movie, and we're gonna
support each other because

07:05.282 --> 07:06.448
that's what friends do.

07:06.450 --> 07:07.716
Okay.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.751
'Cause if I
had to pick now,

07:09.753 --> 07:10.681
I'd probably go with
dark matter because...

07:10.706 --> 07:12.706
PENNY: Shut up.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:26.398 --> 07:28.766
(moans)

07:29.634 --> 07:30.768
What's wrong?

07:30.770 --> 07:33.637
I don't understand my food.

07:34.939 --> 07:39.009
Chinese noodles with
Korean barbecue...

07:39.011 --> 07:41.445
in a taco.

07:43.248 --> 07:45.115
It's fusion.

07:45.117 --> 07:47.618
Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

07:47.620 --> 07:51.522
if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

07:54.759 --> 07:56.994
Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

07:56.996 --> 07:58.796
Not at all.

07:58.798 --> 08:00.230
Thank you.

08:00.232 --> 08:02.399
But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say

08:02.401 --> 08:06.170
sounds like, "Wah,
wah, wah, clothes".

08:09.741 --> 08:12.042
Hey, I don't understand
why you're not upset with Amy.

08:12.044 --> 08:14.611
I am. So much so that
I'm gonna bring her here

08:14.613 --> 08:16.847
for dinner on our
next date night.

08:19.784 --> 08:21.985
(heavy metal soundtrack
plays on movie)

08:27.158 --> 08:29.159
Okay.

08:29.161 --> 08:31.862
So, in the last 20 minutes,

08:31.864 --> 08:34.664
we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in a jar.

08:36.067 --> 08:39.602
We've seen a guy
cut in half and sewn to a fish.

08:40.972 --> 08:43.807
And the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken

08:43.808 --> 08:46.009
by my mother.

08:47.245 --> 08:51.582
On the bright side, she didn't
even notice the pill.

08:53.785 --> 08:56.453
Why does Emily like this stuff?

08:56.455 --> 08:58.655
Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

08:58.657 --> 09:01.125
What difference does it make?
What do you mean?

09:01.127 --> 09:02.759
Oh, come on-- she could
have a freezer full of

09:02.761 --> 09:05.596
ex-boyfriend's body parts and
you'd still go out with her.

09:06.764 --> 09:08.398
I do like that
the ex-boyfriend's

09:08.400 --> 09:09.833
out of the picture.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.039
I feel so bad about
lying to Sheldon.

09:16.041 --> 09:17.808
How am I gonna
make it up to him?

09:17.810 --> 09:19.476
I'd tell you
what I do with Howard,

09:19.478 --> 09:21.778
but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

09:21.780 --> 09:24.848
is gonna work with Sheldon.

09:27.385 --> 09:29.486
He'd probably give you homework.

09:33.725 --> 09:35.926
Did you lie to Howard
about tonight?

09:35.928 --> 09:36.960
Of course.

09:36.962 --> 09:38.595
And you don't feel
guilty about it?

09:38.597 --> 09:39.863
Between Penny's gorilla movie

09:39.865 --> 09:43.367
and Howard's gorilla mother,
I had no choice.

09:44.435 --> 09:45.869
Thankfully Penny and I have

09:45.871 --> 09:47.304
a relationship based on honesty.

09:47.306 --> 09:48.805
(snorts)

09:48.807 --> 09:50.440
What?

09:50.442 --> 09:51.775
I don't lie to her.

09:51.777 --> 09:54.378
Oh, we know
<i>you</i> don't lie to <i>her.</i>

10:00.585 --> 10:02.085
Thank you.

10:02.087 --> 10:03.320
Hey, maybe the answer

10:03.322 --> 10:05.889
to your career question is
in one of these.

10:05.891 --> 10:08.659
Penny,
there's only one cookie

10:08.661 --> 10:11.094
with something in the middle
that solves life's problems,

10:11.096 --> 10:13.163
and that's an Oreo.

10:14.365 --> 10:18.335
Or a Nutter Butter,
if you're in a pinch.

10:18.337 --> 10:21.138
Come on, open it.
I bet it says something great.

10:21.140 --> 10:22.940
This is Asian fusion.

10:22.942 --> 10:27.144
For all you know, there's
a tiny Chihuahua in here.

10:27.146 --> 10:29.112
Fine, I'll go.

10:29.114 --> 10:31.014
Hmm.

10:31.016 --> 10:33.917
"People turn to you
for guidance and wisdom."

10:33.919 --> 10:35.219
Yeah, that's a good one.

10:35.221 --> 10:37.321
No, it's not.

10:37.323 --> 10:38.755
How is that not good?

10:38.757 --> 10:40.991
"Turn to you for wisdom"?

10:40.993 --> 10:43.694
Clearly,
that cookie is mocking you.

10:44.696 --> 10:46.296
You'd never hear
that kind of sass

10:46.298 --> 10:48.298
from a Nutter Butter.

10:48.300 --> 10:50.701
Uh, since you're paying for
dinner, I'll let that slide.

10:50.703 --> 10:52.135
Open yours.

10:53.771 --> 10:55.772
Have you ever paid for a meal?

10:55.774 --> 10:57.341
Not with money. Read.

11:00.278 --> 11:04.414
"Your warm and fun-loving nature
delights those around you."

11:04.416 --> 11:06.450
Oh, try again.
(clears her throat)

11:08.987 --> 11:11.455
(loud thudding on TV)

11:11.457 --> 11:13.857
(creaking on TV)

11:13.859 --> 11:15.125
(movie stops)

11:15.127 --> 11:16.493
(clears his throat)

11:17.328 --> 11:19.596
Let me get this straight.

11:19.598 --> 11:22.232
So, he kills this girl's father,

11:22.234 --> 11:24.434
cuts off the guy's face,

11:24.436 --> 11:26.536
and is wearing it as a mask

11:26.538 --> 11:29.406
while he makes out with her.

11:29.408 --> 11:31.308
I'm just gonna say it.

11:31.310 --> 11:34.044
That's not okay.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.781
Why can't I be in a relationship

11:37.783 --> 11:40.684
with a girl
who likes <i>The Sound of Music?</i>

11:40.686 --> 11:44.121
Raj, you <i>are</i> the girl
in the relationship

11:44.123 --> 11:46.323
who likes <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

11:47.158 --> 11:49.359
(ringtone playing)

11:50.561 --> 11:52.996
Hey, Penny. What's up?

11:54.065 --> 11:56.233
No, Bernie's working late.

11:58.069 --> 12:00.470
Really?

12:00.472 --> 12:02.205
Thanks for telling me.

12:02.207 --> 12:04.975
What?

12:04.977 --> 12:08.111
I'm having sex with a Catholic
schoolgirl tonight.

12:08.113 --> 12:10.280
(laughs)

12:12.383 --> 12:14.017
(Penny gasps)

12:14.019 --> 12:16.453
Oh, I think I see
our next stop.

12:16.455 --> 12:18.121
(shrieks happily)

12:18.123 --> 12:20.724
You can't be serious.

12:20.726 --> 12:22.492
If I wanted to waste my time
on nonsense,

12:22.494 --> 12:24.961
I'd follow Leonard
on Instagram.

12:25.997 --> 12:29.199
No, come on-- tonight,
we are trying new things.

12:29.201 --> 12:30.967
(groans)

12:30.969 --> 12:33.437
Oh! That's a lot of incense.

12:33.439 --> 12:36.139
Or someone set a hippie on fire.

12:39.811 --> 12:41.978
Yeah, honey,
I'm still stuck at work.

12:43.247 --> 12:44.614
Really?

12:44.616 --> 12:45.849
Penny said that?

12:47.952 --> 12:50.854
Okay, it's true. I'm sorry.

12:50.856 --> 12:53.123
I'll see you at home.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.492
Yeah, yeah, I'll put it on.

12:56.828 --> 12:59.229
You and I never just
hang out like this.

12:59.231 --> 13:00.397
Why is that?

13:00.399 --> 13:02.199
I know, it's weird, right?
Yeah.

13:02.201 --> 13:03.367
We should do it more often.

13:03.369 --> 13:05.969
Oh, no. I mean, this
is weird right now.

13:05.971 --> 13:07.337
(phone chimes)

13:07.339 --> 13:09.005
Oh.

13:09.007 --> 13:10.507
Ah, it's Penny.

13:10.509 --> 13:11.842
Is she still mad?

13:11.844 --> 13:12.976
Oh, doesn't seem like it.

13:12.978 --> 13:15.679
She got Sheldon to go
to a psychic with her.

13:15.681 --> 13:16.980
A psychic?

13:16.982 --> 13:19.383
He considers them
not just mumbo jumbo,

13:19.385 --> 13:22.452
but extra-jumbo
mumbo jumbo.

13:22.454 --> 13:24.888
Well, Penny can be
pretty persuasive.

13:24.890 --> 13:27.924
She's gotten me to do a lot of
things I wouldn't normally do.

13:27.926 --> 13:29.860
Because she has
sex with you.

13:29.862 --> 13:32.896
Yeah, she does.

13:32.898 --> 13:35.265
Can I confess something?

13:35.267 --> 13:37.167
Once in a while,
I get a little jealous

13:37.169 --> 13:38.602
of how close Penny
and Sheldon are.

13:38.604 --> 13:39.668
Really?

13:39.693 --> 13:41.272
I mean, not in
a romantic way.

13:41.273 --> 13:44.741
It's just, she really has some
sort of connection with him.

13:44.743 --> 13:47.477
Well... Well, they've known
each other a long time,

13:47.479 --> 13:49.846
and Penny grew up around horses,

13:49.848 --> 13:53.650
so she knows how to approach him
without making him skittish.

13:53.652 --> 13:55.886
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad they're friends.

13:55.888 --> 13:58.355
I just wish he'd be that
comfortable around me already.

13:58.357 --> 14:02.726
Well, it took him a long time to
get comfortable around me, too.

14:02.728 --> 14:05.028
Really? What did you do?

14:05.030 --> 14:08.498
Something terrible in a former life?
I don't know.

14:08.500 --> 14:11.034
I gotta go.

14:11.036 --> 14:12.636
Penny ratted me out.

14:12.638 --> 14:14.404
FYI, she's getting you
a watch for your birthday

14:14.406 --> 14:16.206
with money she took
out of your wallet.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.949
I don't mean to be
rude or discourteous,

14:25.951 --> 14:27.784
but before we begin,
I'd just like to say

14:27.786 --> 14:30.353
there is absolutely
no scientific evidence

14:30.355 --> 14:32.689
to support clairvoyance
of any kind.

14:32.691 --> 14:34.591
Which means--

14:34.593 --> 14:38.862
and again, no insult intended--
but you're a fraud...

14:39.697 --> 14:41.832
...your profession
is a swindle,

14:41.834 --> 14:43.366
and, uh, your livelihood
is dependent

14:43.368 --> 14:46.236
on the gullibility
of stupid people.

14:47.572 --> 14:50.640
Again, no offense.

14:50.642 --> 14:52.409
All right, Sheldon,
just ask your question.

14:52.411 --> 14:55.612
(clears his throat)

14:55.614 --> 14:58.248
Okay, I just did.
What was it?

14:59.183 --> 15:00.517
Oh, for God's sake.

15:00.519 --> 15:01.818
Look, he's a physicist
who's trying to figure out

15:01.820 --> 15:03.119
what his next field
of study should be.

15:03.121 --> 15:04.321
For your information,

15:04.323 --> 15:07.290
I was asking her
about the next <i>Star Trek</i> movie.

15:07.292 --> 15:11.094
Okay, I can answer that one:
I'll be bored.

15:11.096 --> 15:13.363
All right, why don't we begin?

15:13.365 --> 15:15.632
(sighs)

15:15.634 --> 15:17.801
(exhales deeply)

15:21.138 --> 15:23.073
Your spirit guides
are telling me

15:23.075 --> 15:25.175
that there's a woman
in your life

15:25.177 --> 15:27.177
you're having problems with.

15:27.179 --> 15:29.346
That's an easy guess.

15:29.348 --> 15:31.047
I'm clearly an annoying person

15:31.049 --> 15:33.550
and have problems
with both genders.

15:33.552 --> 15:36.753
Yes, you clearly are.

15:38.055 --> 15:39.356
But I'm seeing

15:39.358 --> 15:40.957
a specific woman

15:40.959 --> 15:43.593
that you're in a romantic
relationship with.

15:43.595 --> 15:45.929
Oh, oh, here we go.

15:46.998 --> 15:48.064
Does she have dark hair?

15:48.066 --> 15:52.068
Yes! Yes! Your spirit guides
are on fire!

15:52.070 --> 15:54.271
The majority
of people have dark hair.

15:54.273 --> 15:56.773
Even you, at one time.

15:57.942 --> 15:59.809
Does she work
in a similar field to you?

15:59.811 --> 16:01.411
Ha! The opposite.

16:01.413 --> 16:04.581
She's a neurobiologist, and
I'm a theoretical physicist.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.816
My spirit guides
can go suck an egg.

16:08.052 --> 16:09.352
They're telling me

16:09.354 --> 16:11.788
that you have difficulty
being close with her.

16:11.790 --> 16:14.324
Oh, he does. He <i>so</i> does.
What should he do?

16:14.326 --> 16:16.526
(exhales)

16:18.362 --> 16:20.864
He should give himself
to this relationship.

16:20.866 --> 16:22.933
Once he does, all his

16:22.935 --> 16:25.168
other pursuits will come
into focus.

16:25.170 --> 16:26.469
Sheldon, do you hear that?

16:26.471 --> 16:28.805
I mean, Amy is the key
to your happiness.

16:28.807 --> 16:30.006
Exactly.

16:30.008 --> 16:31.841
Personally and professionally.

16:31.843 --> 16:36.046
Everything will fall into place
once you commit to her.

16:41.185 --> 16:43.286
You know what this is?

16:43.288 --> 16:46.289
Yeah, and I reserve this word
for those rare instances

16:46.291 --> 16:47.991
when it's truly deserved.

16:47.993 --> 16:50.293
This is malarkey!

16:54.865 --> 16:56.533
Wow, you really struck a nerve.

16:56.535 --> 16:59.469
I've never heard him use
the "M" word before.

17:08.252 --> 17:09.753
Here we go:

17:09.756 --> 17:11.756
<i>House of a 1,000 Corpses.</i>

17:11.758 --> 17:13.558
Now, just so you know,

17:13.560 --> 17:16.294
I was a nanny for three years,
so if you get scared,

17:16.296 --> 17:18.529
I can totally change
your diaper.

17:18.531 --> 17:22.098
Actually, I have to
tell you something.

17:22.101 --> 17:25.368
These kind of movies
really aren't my thing,

17:25.371 --> 17:27.305
so, last night,
I watched it

17:27.327 --> 17:28.766
just to see what I was
getting myself into.

17:28.791 --> 17:30.375
Okay.

17:30.376 --> 17:32.476
And I have to be honest--
I thought it was

17:32.478 --> 17:35.379
disturbing and weird,
and it made me wonder

17:35.381 --> 17:37.582
what it says about
someone who enjoys it.

17:37.584 --> 17:39.750
I wonder that, too.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.752
Then, why do you
watch these things?

17:41.754 --> 17:44.488
Can I tell you something
without you judging me?

17:44.490 --> 17:46.457
Sure.

17:46.459 --> 17:48.459
They kind of turn me on.

17:48.461 --> 17:51.095
And play.

17:51.097 --> 17:53.331
(eerie sound effects,
heavy metal soundtrack playing)

17:56.435 --> 17:58.102
MAN (in distorted voice):
Attention...

17:59.237 --> 18:01.439
(knocking)

18:03.208 --> 18:05.176
Hello.

18:05.178 --> 18:06.844
I didn't expect you
this evening.

18:06.846 --> 18:08.813
Well, I was just feeling so bad

18:08.815 --> 18:10.514
about lying to you
the other night,

18:10.516 --> 18:13.217
I wanted to make it up to you.

18:13.219 --> 18:15.553
And how do you propose
to do that?

18:26.982 --> 18:29.318
Unless you have <i>Gravity</i>
on Blu-ray under that skirt,

18:29.319 --> 18:30.851
I don't know
where you're going with this.
