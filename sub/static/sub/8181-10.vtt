00:36.118 --> 00:37.786
DARLING, HAVE YOU SEEN
MY PASSPORT?

00:37.853 --> 00:40.188
I'M LEAVING SOON, AND
I REALLY SHOULD HAVE IT.

00:40.255 --> 00:42.424
DAD, YOU'RE GOIN'
TO NEW JERSEY.

00:42.491 --> 00:45.627
STILL, BORDER CROSSINGS ARE
NOTHING TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

00:45.695 --> 00:49.347
I'M AFRAID I LEARNED
THAT THE HARD WAY.

00:49.414 --> 00:51.816
I THINK IT'S SWEET THAT YOU
VISIT MOM'S GRAVE EVERY YEAR.

00:51.884 --> 00:53.951
I CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS.

00:54.019 --> 00:55.403
I KNOW, AND IT'S
A SHAME SHE NEVER SAW

00:55.471 --> 00:58.189
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG
WOMAN YOU'VE BECOME.

00:58.257 --> 00:59.807
THANK YOU, DAD.

00:59.875 --> 01:03.127
AS ALWAYS, I'LL SEND HER
YOUR WARMEST REGARDS.

01:03.195 --> 01:05.062
YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I THINK I'M GONNA-

01:05.129 --> 01:06.564
I'M GONNA COME
WITH YOU THIS TIME.

01:06.632 --> 01:09.334
WHY? YOU-YOU-
YOU NEVER COME.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.386
I KNOW. WELL, I WAS
A TEENAGER WHEN SHE DIED,

01:11.454 --> 01:14.922
AND I THINK I WAS ANGRY AT HER
FOR LEAVING ME WITHOUT A MOTHER,

01:14.990 --> 01:18.125
<i>ESPECIALLY WHEN I HAD
TO GO BRA SHOPPING WITH YOU.</i>

01:18.193 --> 01:20.095
IN RETROSPECT,
I SHOULD'VE LET YOU

01:20.162 --> 01:23.131
GO INTO THE DRESSING
ROOM BY YOURSELF.

01:23.199 --> 01:24.866
ANYWAY, I'LL SEE YOU
ON MONDAY.

01:24.934 --> 01:26.217
DAD, I SAID I'M GONNA
COME WITH YOU.

01:26.285 --> 01:27.385
YOU CAN'T!

01:27.452 --> 01:28.920
WHY NOT?

01:28.988 --> 01:30.822
I, UH...

01:30.890 --> 01:32.807
I'M STAYING WITH
YOUR UNCLE CHESTER,

01:32.875 --> 01:34.542
AND HE LIKES TO WALK
AROUND IN THE NUDE.

01:34.610 --> 01:36.444
I WON'T HAVE YOU
SEE THAT AGAIN!

01:36.511 --> 01:38.279
THEN WE'LL STAY
IN A MOTEL.

01:38.346 --> 01:40.715
JUST GIVE ME A HALF HOUR
TO GET PACKED.

01:42.868 --> 01:44.035
HEY, BABE, LISTEN,

01:44.103 --> 01:46.137
I'M GOING UP TO NEW
JERSEY WITH MY FATHER

01:46.205 --> 01:48.506
TO VISIT MY MOM'S GRAVE
FOR THE WEEKEND.

01:48.573 --> 01:49.841
YOU'RE GONNA BE GONE
THE WHOLE WEEKEND?

01:49.909 --> 01:51.076
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:51.143 --> 01:53.111
COULD YOU AT LEAST PRETEND
YOU'RE GONNA MISS ME?

01:53.179 --> 01:56.347
OF COURSE I'M GONNA
MISS YOU. I AM. OK?

02:02.288 --> 02:04.572
WHICH ONE OF THESE
GOES BETTER WITH STEAK-UMS?

02:04.640 --> 02:06.374
UM, I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

02:06.442 --> 02:07.692
I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY THESE
"FLAMIN' HOT" ONES,

02:07.759 --> 02:10.561
BUT I HEAR IF YOU EAT THE WHOLE
BAG, YOUR TONGUE GETS SWOLLEN.

02:10.628 --> 02:13.915
MY MANAGER JUST TOLD ME
TO STACK THE BEAN DIP.

02:13.983 --> 02:16.935
HEY, YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
GET 'EM BOTH, SO WHY THE DANCE?

02:17.003 --> 02:18.803
RAY! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

02:18.871 --> 02:21.038
HEY, MAN! WHAT'S IT BEEN,
LIKE, 2 YEARS?

02:21.106 --> 02:22.156
AT LEAST.
YEAH.

02:22.224 --> 02:24.276
WHAT DO WE DO? DO WE SHAKE?
YOU DON'T HUG, RIGHT?

02:24.343 --> 02:26.744
I DO. WITH SOME PEOPLE,
I DO. YEAH.

02:26.812 --> 02:28.513
ALL RIGHT. COOL.

02:28.581 --> 02:29.847
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:29.915 --> 02:31.849
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO EATS, MAN.

02:31.917 --> 02:33.084
WHAT DO YOU GOT
GOIN' ON HERE?

02:33.152 --> 02:36.454
UH, A LOG OF SALAMI,
CHIPS, AND CHEESE.

02:36.522 --> 02:38.857
I GUESS YOU'RE NOT BUYIN' INTO
THE WHOLE CHOLESTEROL THING, HUH?

02:38.925 --> 02:40.091
OH, I'M BUYIN' INTO IT.

02:40.159 --> 02:41.859
I JUST WANT TO SEE HOW
HIGH I CAN GET THE NUMBERS.

02:41.927 --> 02:43.411
SO, WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO?

02:43.479 --> 02:45.947
NOTHIN'. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE
DOIN' THE FLOORS AT MY HOUSE,

02:46.014 --> 02:47.348
SO DEBRA TOOK THE KIDS

02:47.416 --> 02:48.583
AND I'M SLEEPIN'

02:48.651 --> 02:50.384
OH, MY GOD.
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

02:50.453 --> 02:51.786
YEAH. WELL,
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

02:51.854 --> 02:56.057
SINCE I WOKE UP COVERED

02:56.124 --> 02:57.459
YEAH, I HEAR THAT.

02:57.526 --> 02:59.193
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:59.261 --> 03:01.162
CARRIE'S OUT WITH HER
DAD THIS WHOLE WEEKEND.

03:01.229 --> 03:03.098
SHE'S GONE. WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CRASH AT MY PLACE?

03:03.165 --> 03:04.215
IT'LL BE FUN.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.117
YEAH?
YEAH!

03:06.184 --> 03:07.652
THINK ABOUT IT. JUST ME AND YOU, RIGHT?

03:07.720 --> 03:09.854
NO SKIRTS GIVIN' US
THE YAP-YAP. HA HA!

03:09.921 --> 03:11.756
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:11.824 --> 03:15.960
YEAH, YEAH. LET ME JUST ASK
MY MOM-TELL. I'M GONNA...

03:18.147 --> 03:20.382
HEY, MA. MA, LISTEN,

03:20.449 --> 03:23.485
I'M GONNA SLEEP AT
MY FRIEND DOUG'S HOUSE.

03:23.552 --> 03:27.555
NO, THIS IS NOT MY WAY
OF TELLING YOU I'M GAY.

03:27.623 --> 03:30.258
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I WOULD TELL YOU, MA.

03:30.326 --> 03:32.127
ALL RIGHT. I'M HANGIN' UP.
I'M HANGIN' UP, MA.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.246
THAT'S THE ANSWERING MACHINE.
WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD.

03:35.314 --> 03:37.082
OK.
YEAH. YEAH.

03:40.152 --> 03:43.722
IT'S THIS WAY,
JUST PAST ETHEL MERMAN.

03:43.789 --> 03:46.625
YOUR MOTHER IS LAID TO REST
AMONG BROADWAY ROYALTY.

03:46.692 --> 03:49.878
DAD, THAT SAYS
"ETHEL MELMAN."

03:49.945 --> 03:51.612
WAIT, WAIT.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.382
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
YOUR MOTHER IN 20 YEARS.

03:54.449 --> 03:57.986
I WANT HER GRAVE
TO LOOK SHIP-SHAPE. OK?

04:13.486 --> 04:15.887
SOPHIA,
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

04:15.954 --> 04:18.589
I HAD A LITTLE DISPUTE
WITH A TOLL TAKER

04:18.658 --> 04:20.392
OVER THEIR
"NO PENNIES" POLICY.

04:20.459 --> 04:23.328
MORE ABOUT THAT LATER.

04:23.396 --> 04:24.529
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.631
I BROUGHT YOUR DAUGHTER
TO SEE YOU.

04:29.034 --> 04:30.402
HI, MOM.

04:30.469 --> 04:33.938
SORRY IT'S TAKEN ME
SO LONG TO GET HERE,

04:34.005 --> 04:35.540
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

04:35.608 --> 04:37.342
GOOD STUFF.
NOW, LET'S GO.

04:37.409 --> 04:39.076
DAD, COULD YOU
GIVE ME A MINUTE?

04:41.430 --> 04:42.864
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL
STONE, DAD.

04:42.932 --> 04:44.032
THANK YOU.

04:44.100 --> 04:47.568
"SOPHIA SPOONER,
BELOVED WIFE OF ARTHUR,

04:47.636 --> 04:49.838
DEVOTED MOTHER TO... "

04:49.905 --> 04:52.273
THE FLOWERS ARE
COVERING MY NAME.

04:52.341 --> 04:54.142
NOT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT YOU. LET'S GO!

04:54.210 --> 04:56.077
THIS PLACE GIVE ME

04:58.313 --> 05:00.831
"DEVOTED MOTHER TO...

05:00.899 --> 05:02.216
SIMONE?"

05:02.284 --> 05:04.369
I NEVER NOTICED THAT.

05:04.437 --> 05:06.338
MUST BE A TYPO.
SHALL WE?

05:06.405 --> 05:08.105
DAD, WHAT-
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

05:08.173 --> 05:10.007
WHY ISN'T MY NAME
THERE?

05:12.144 --> 05:13.845
IT'S A LONG STORY,
DARLING.

05:15.631 --> 05:18.382
YOU REMEMBER
YOUR COUSIN SIMONE?

05:18.450 --> 05:21.619
COUSIN SIMONE
IS MY SISTER?

05:21.687 --> 05:24.071
NO, NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

05:24.140 --> 05:25.406
YOU'RE SIMONE.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.363
UP TO YOU.

05:32.431 --> 05:33.748
ARE YOU ALMOST DONE,
DADDY?

05:33.816 --> 05:37.251
UH, NO, SIMONE.
DADDY'S STILL PLAYING.

05:37.319 --> 05:38.719
ARE YOU WINNING?

05:38.787 --> 05:41.522
IF YOU MUST KNOW,
I'M DOWN $600.

05:41.589 --> 05:44.508
OY.

05:44.577 --> 05:47.178
WHY DON'T YOU GO PLAY
WITH YOUR COUSIN CARRIE?

05:47.245 --> 05:49.180
OK.

05:50.065 --> 05:52.483
WELL, IT'S JUST

05:58.890 --> 06:00.658
I DON'T HAVE

06:00.726 --> 06:04.028

06:04.096 --> 06:05.663

06:09.902 --> 06:14.038
NO, THAT'S NOT GONNA
CUT IT, ARTHUR.

06:14.106 --> 06:16.040
BUT YOU DO HAVE
SOMETHING I WANT.

06:16.108 --> 06:17.108
WHAT?

06:17.175 --> 06:18.576

06:18.644 --> 06:20.778
YOU WANNA PLAY FOR "SIMONE"?!

06:20.846 --> 06:22.881
YOU KNEW WE WANTED THAT
NAME FOR OUR LITTLE GIRL!

06:22.948 --> 06:24.548

06:24.616 --> 06:27.718
WELL, THE PREMATURE BIRD
GETS THE WORM!

06:27.786 --> 06:29.753
ARE YOU IN,

06:38.697 --> 06:41.933
YOU LOST MY NAME
IN A POKER GAME?!

06:42.001 --> 06:43.835

06:43.903 --> 06:47.739

06:56.832 --> 07:00.384
HA! I LOVE
THE WALLPAPER GUY, MAN.

07:00.452 --> 07:02.603
ALWAYS YELLIN'
AT THE PLUMBER.

07:02.671 --> 07:05.973
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE COOL
IF THEY HAD A NAIL-GUN FIGHT.

07:06.041 --> 07:08.709
THAT PLUMBER WOULD
BEAT HIM SENSELESS.

07:08.777 --> 07:11.429
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WALLPAPER GUY'S TOUGH.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.748
YEAH, BUT THAT PLUMBER,
HE'S GOT, LIKE, CRAZY EYES.

07:13.815 --> 07:15.750

07:15.817 --> 07:18.419
UH-HA HA. EASY.

07:45.747 --> 07:47.415

07:48.317 --> 07:50.334
YOU WANT ME

07:51.686 --> 07:52.886
NO! NO. LET'S JUST-

07:52.955 --> 07:54.822
LET'S SHAKE IT UP
A LITTLE BIT.

07:54.889 --> 07:57.625
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
WELL, YOU WANNA GET A PIZZA?

07:57.692 --> 07:58.376
NO!

08:00.128 --> 08:02.563
YES, I DO, BUT NOT-
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

08:05.266 --> 08:05.983
WELL, WHAT?

08:06.135 --> 08:07.268
I JUS-

08:08.286 --> 08:09.353
BEFORE I WAS
WITH CARRIE,

08:09.421 --> 08:11.555
I... I USED-I DID
WHATEVER I WANTED TO DO.

08:11.623 --> 08:13.457
YOU KNOW? I WAS
LIKE A WILD BULL.

08:14.627 --> 08:15.593
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.211
YEAH.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.646
LET'S DO THAT
TONIGHT. LET'S...

08:18.713 --> 08:20.114
LET'S BE WILD BULLS.

08:20.182 --> 08:22.984
ALL RIGHT! ALL RIGHT.
I CAN DO WILD BULL.

08:23.051 --> 08:25.153
WHAT... WHAT... WHAT
DO WILD BULLS DO?

08:25.220 --> 08:27.538
WELL... CARRIE DOESN'T
LIKE IT WHEN I MAKE A MESS,

08:27.606 --> 08:30.675
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL A
BULL NOT TO MAKE A MESS!

08:30.742 --> 08:32.092
YEEEAAAHHH!

08:32.159 --> 08:33.660
OOOWWWW!

08:36.498 --> 08:39.033
W- WE GOT
ANY MORE CHEETOS?

08:41.654 --> 08:43.254
NO. I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.682
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE
MAKING SUCH A BIG DEAL OUTTA THIS.

08:54.749 --> 08:57.451
DAD... IF IT'S NOT
SUCH A BIG DEAL,

08:57.519 --> 09:00.954
THEN WHY DID MOM HAVE YOU
PUT "SIMONE" ON HER TOMBSTONE?

09:01.022 --> 09:02.440
SHE NEVER FORGAVE ME
FOR LOSING IT.

09:02.508 --> 09:04.776
EVEN IN DEATH,
SHE WAS PETTY.

09:04.843 --> 09:07.561
YOU KNOW WHAT, DAD? I HAVE
PUT UP WITH YOUR CRAZINESS

09:07.629 --> 09:09.130
MY WHOLE LIFE.

09:09.198 --> 09:12.300
YOU HAVE RUINED RELATIONSHIPS
FOR ME, COST ME JOBS.

09:12.368 --> 09:13.901
YOU EVEN SPENT
MY COLLEGE TUITION

09:13.969 --> 09:16.137
ON BUYING THE RIGHTS
TO THE LOU RAWLS STORY.

09:16.205 --> 09:18.005
THAT STORY NEEDS TO BE
TOLD, AND IT WILL BE!

09:18.073 --> 09:19.006
OHHH...

09:20.075 --> 09:22.743
DARLING...
IT'S JUST A NAME.

09:22.810 --> 09:25.145
DAD, IT IS NOT
JUST A NAME. OK?

09:25.214 --> 09:28.316
IT'S IMPORTANT. IT-
IT DEFINES WHO YOU ARE,

09:28.383 --> 09:30.384
HOW PEOPLE TREAT YOU.

09:30.452 --> 09:32.636
I MEAN, IF I'D
BEEN SIMONE, I...

09:32.704 --> 09:36.808
MAYBE I WOULD'VE HAD A
WHOLE, DIFFERENT, BETTER LIFE.

09:36.875 --> 09:38.910
BUT WE'LL NEVER KNOW,
WILL WE?

09:39.711 --> 09:41.228
