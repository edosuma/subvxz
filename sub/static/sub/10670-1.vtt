WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:06.807
>> CAITLYN: Here we go.

00:06.807 --> 00:10.644
Well, a month ago...

00:10.644 --> 00:13.481
I left on a trip with the girls,

00:13.481 --> 00:16.384
hoping to meet a bunch of trans

00:16.384 --> 00:17.918
people, learn about their

00:17.918 --> 00:19.787
stories, and what happened is

00:19.787 --> 00:22.523
I... is, honestly, I-I wound up

00:22.523 --> 00:24.024
learning probably more about

00:24.024 --> 00:26.660
myself than anything.

00:26.660 --> 00:27.661
>> CHANDI: Would you consider

00:27.661 --> 00:29.263
yourself to be lesbian?

00:29.263 --> 00:31.199
>> CAITLYN: Uh...

00:31.199 --> 00:33.401
I am slowly coming into my

00:33.401 --> 00:35.035
womanhood, but it's a work in

00:35.035 --> 00:36.036
progress.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.671
Old Bruce... did a lot of good

00:37.671 --> 00:39.473
things in his life.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.474
Not that that old person was a

00:40.474 --> 00:42.576
bad person, he just wasn't me.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.112
I thought I knew a lot more than

00:44.112 --> 00:46.314
I actually turned out to know.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.415
What did I say now?

00:47.415 --> 00:48.416
>> CANDIS: That if you look like

00:48.416 --> 00:50.017
a man in a dress it makes other

00:50.017 --> 00:51.585
people uncomfortable.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.586
>> JENNY: People need to know

00:52.586 --> 00:53.687
that you're fighting for

00:53.687 --> 00:54.755
everybody, not just the pretty

00:54.755 --> 00:56.224
ones.

00:56.224 --> 00:57.258
>> WOMAN: Caitlyn Jenner, you're

00:57.258 --> 00:59.927
an insult to all trans people.

00:59.927 --> 01:00.994
>> CAITLYN: I've made mistakes

01:00.994 --> 01:02.330
along the way, I've been

01:02.330 --> 01:03.331
criticized for 'em.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.332
>> CHANDI: How can you focus on

01:04.332 --> 01:05.499
trying to get a job when you

01:05.499 --> 01:06.500
don't where you're gonna sleep

01:06.500 --> 01:07.501
at night?

01:07.501 --> 01:08.502
>> JENNY: It's not about the

01:08.502 --> 01:09.002
issues.

01:09.002 --> 01:10.003
We're telling you, we were

01:10.003 --> 01:13.407
scared.

01:13.407 --> 01:14.408
>> CAITLYN: Sometimes it got

01:14.408 --> 01:15.609
pretty heated.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.610
>> JENNY: You're telling me

01:16.610 --> 01:17.811
Republicans support rights for

01:17.811 --> 01:19.147
transgender people.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.148
>> CAITLYN: Every conservative

01:20.148 --> 01:21.249
guy out there believes in

01:21.249 --> 01:22.283
everybody's rights.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.317
>> JENNY: That is a lie.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.318
>> CAITLYN: When I realized I

01:24.318 --> 01:25.653
have to keep an open mind

01:25.653 --> 01:27.621
politically, socially, on trans

01:27.621 --> 01:29.590
issues, on womanhood.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.325
I have to learn from my girls,

01:31.325 --> 01:32.493
learn from society.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.061
I don't want to hurt anybody.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.062
>> CANDIS: Don't you really mean

01:35.062 --> 01:36.063
you don't want to get hurt

01:36.063 --> 01:37.064
yourself?

01:37.064 --> 01:38.065
>> CAITLYN: Hey!

01:38.065 --> 01:38.766
>> CANDIS: Hey!

01:38.766 --> 01:39.700
>> CAITLYN: But also we had so

01:39.700 --> 01:40.834
much fun on this trip that I

01:40.834 --> 01:41.869
never, ever expected.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.003
You're voted in, I know.

01:43.003 --> 01:44.872
>> KRIS: Aw, thanks, guys.

01:44.872 --> 01:45.873
(cheering)

01:45.873 --> 01:47.275
>> CAITLYN: It was a growing

01:47.275 --> 01:49.009
process for me, and we all still

01:49.009 --> 01:50.444
loved each other when it was all

01:50.444 --> 01:52.012
over, and that was by far the

01:52.012 --> 01:54.415
most important thing.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.384
*

02:09.863 --> 02:11.865
(knocking)

02:11.865 --> 02:13.601
>> CAITLYN: Oh, my God!

02:13.601 --> 02:15.669
Jenny Boylan is in the house!

02:15.669 --> 02:17.104
Look at you, you look so nice.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.272
>> JENNY: Hi, sweetie.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.840
>> CAITLYN: Baby doll.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.342
How are you doing?

02:21.342 --> 02:22.343
>> JENNY: Totally psyched.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.344
>> CAITLYN: I know, good.

02:23.344 --> 02:23.844
I am too, s...

02:23.844 --> 02:24.845
>> JENNY: So, what, so you think

02:24.845 --> 02:25.846
I've just been goofing off these

02:25.846 --> 02:26.847
last six months?

02:26.847 --> 02:27.848
>> CAITLYN: Today's a big day.

02:27.848 --> 02:28.849
I'm getting ready to start this

02:28.849 --> 02:29.850
next chapter.

02:29.850 --> 02:30.851
It's so good to have you with

02:30.851 --> 02:31.852
us.

02:31.852 --> 02:32.853
>> KATE: So good to see you.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.854
>> CAITLYN: I was so excited.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.855
Jenny.

02:34.855 --> 02:35.856
>> JENNY: Auntie K.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.857
>> KATE: Miss Jenny.

02:36.857 --> 02:37.858
>> JENNY: Auntie K.

02:37.858 --> 02:38.859
Hi, darling.

02:38.859 --> 02:39.860
>> CAITLYN: All of the girls

02:39.860 --> 02:40.861
have come to town because we

02:40.861 --> 02:41.862
came up with this idea: let's go

02:41.862 --> 02:42.863
on the road.

02:42.863 --> 02:43.864
>> CHANDI: I-I want to say thank

02:43.864 --> 02:44.865
you, first of all.

02:44.865 --> 02:45.866
>> CAITLYN: You got it, baby,

02:45.866 --> 02:46.367
you got it.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.368
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.369
>> CAITLYN: I have this

02:48.369 --> 02:50.371
platform, but I still have to

02:50.371 --> 02:52.406
learn so much more to be a great

02:52.406 --> 02:53.607
representative, uh, for our

02:53.607 --> 02:54.608
community.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.876
I really want to kind of get out

02:55.876 --> 02:57.611
of my comfort zone and immerse

02:57.611 --> 03:00.248
myself in trans issues, find out

03:00.248 --> 03:01.449
more about the people that are

03:01.449 --> 03:03.251
out there in these small towns

03:03.251 --> 03:04.485
across America.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.486
I think it's just going to be

03:05.486 --> 03:06.487
wonderful.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.821
I'll learn a lot and I hope

03:07.821 --> 03:08.989
everybody else learns a lot.

03:08.989 --> 03:09.990
>> CANDIS: Hi, gorge.

03:09.990 --> 03:10.991
>> JENNY: Scarecrow, I've missed

03:10.991 --> 03:11.992
you most of all.

03:11.992 --> 03:12.993
>> CAITLYN: Our newest arrival

03:12.993 --> 03:14.562
is here.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.563
Ella, baby.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.130
>> ELLA: Hi, how are you?

03:17.130 --> 03:18.499
>> CAITLYN: Here we go.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.533
>> KATE: Hello.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.834
>> ELLA: Hey, how are you?

03:20.834 --> 03:22.603
>> KATE: My baby girl.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.637
>> ELLA: I already... I already

03:23.637 --> 03:24.638
have you as "Auntie Kate" in my

03:24.638 --> 03:25.639
phone.

03:25.639 --> 03:26.640
>> CAITLYN: Right after I

03:26.640 --> 03:28.709
transitioned I had a friend from

03:28.709 --> 03:31.279
many years ago calls and says,

03:31.279 --> 03:32.813
"You'll never guess-- you knew

03:32.813 --> 03:36.350
my son very little, well, now is

03:36.350 --> 03:37.651
my daughter."

03:37.651 --> 03:38.652
>> ELLA: My name is Ella

03:38.652 --> 03:39.653
Giselle.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.289
I was 16 when I started

03:41.289 --> 03:43.591
transitioning and I'm 18 now.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.359
Junior year, school ended, and

03:45.359 --> 03:47.194
then I just kind of explored

03:47.194 --> 03:49.096
myself that summer.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.699
And then senior year came and I

03:51.699 --> 03:55.035
came back myself, um, as Ella.

03:55.035 --> 03:56.036
>> KYLIE: Hey.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.005
>> CAITLYN: My little Kylie.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.006
Mm, baby doll.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.007
>> JENNY: What a pleasure to

04:00.007 --> 04:01.074
meet you.

04:01.074 --> 04:01.575
>> KATE: Hi.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.576
>> CAITLYN: And Kate Bornstein.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.577
>> KYLIE: How are you?

04:03.577 --> 04:04.578
>> KATE: Hello, baby, say your

04:04.578 --> 04:05.078
name again.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.079
>> KYLIE: Kylie.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
>> CAITLYN: This is my other

04:07.080 --> 04:09.350
daughter, everybody, Kendall.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.351
>> KENDALL: I'm Kendall.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.352
How are you?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.353
>> CAITLYN: That's Ella.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.987
My girls-- all my kids, but

04:13.987 --> 04:15.356
especially Kendall and Kylie--

04:15.356 --> 04:16.890
have to deal with, you know, a

04:16.890 --> 04:19.560
father transitioning.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.961
It's a very, very difficult

04:20.961 --> 04:23.063
process, with all this history

04:23.063 --> 04:24.932
you have in your life.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.934
Am I doing it right?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.969
You can never do this right.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.404
Okay?

04:30.404 --> 04:31.639
The last thing in the world I

04:31.639 --> 04:32.940
want to do is hurt any one of

04:32.940 --> 04:35.242
you.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.345
>> CHANDI: Can I say-- I know

04:37.345 --> 04:38.912
this has not been the easiest

04:38.912 --> 04:40.047
thing for you guys to wrap your

04:40.047 --> 04:42.850
heads around, but you guys are

04:42.850 --> 04:44.151
being real troopers, real

04:44.151 --> 04:45.553
troopers about it.

04:45.553 --> 04:48.622
And we appreciate all the love

04:48.622 --> 04:50.624
you give to Cait and to our full

04:50.624 --> 04:52.025
community, because we need it.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.026
We totally need it.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.027
>> KENDALL: Of course.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.028
>> KYLIE: Thank you.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.029
>> KENDALL: She got pretty

04:56.029 --> 04:57.030
lucky-- we're all very, like,

04:57.030 --> 04:58.399
open, accepting, like,

04:58.399 --> 04:59.400
non-judgmental people.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.468
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.469
>> KENDALL: Like, our whole

05:01.469 --> 05:01.969
family.

05:01.969 --> 05:02.970
>> CAITLYN: I agree...

05:02.970 --> 05:04.905
>> KENDALL: You're welcome.

05:04.905 --> 05:05.906
>> JENNY: It's a thing that...

05:05.906 --> 05:06.974
it's a thing that people need to

05:06.974 --> 05:08.376
learn-- that transgender people

05:08.376 --> 05:09.410
have families.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.811
>> KATE: Miss Kylie, Kendall, I

05:10.811 --> 05:13.481
wanted to know when did you know

05:13.481 --> 05:15.383
you were a girl?

05:15.383 --> 05:17.150
>> KENDALL: Um...

05:17.150 --> 05:18.151
I mean, I've al... I feel like

05:18.151 --> 05:19.152
I've always known.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.187
I feel like that's just, like,

05:20.187 --> 05:22.155
a... like, I mean...

05:22.155 --> 05:23.156
>> KYLIE: You know, I feel like

05:23.156 --> 05:24.425
it was never a question, 'cause

05:24.425 --> 05:25.726
I had so many sisters and I

05:25.726 --> 05:26.727
wanted to be exactly like that.

05:26.727 --> 05:27.728
>> KENDALL: Yeah.

05:27.728 --> 05:28.729
>> ELLA: And I think that's

05:28.729 --> 05:29.830
something that people don't even

05:29.830 --> 05:31.131
realize that they have a gender.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.132
Some people...

05:32.132 --> 05:33.133
>> CAITLYN: First... Yeah, like,

05:33.133 --> 05:35.803
I would look at guys... and

05:35.803 --> 05:38.305
think, "Wouldn't it be nice to

05:38.305 --> 05:40.874
be just, like, a guy and not

05:40.874 --> 05:41.875
have this issue?"

05:41.875 --> 05:42.876
>> CANDIS: I remember thinking

05:42.876 --> 05:43.877
that too.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.878
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, you remember

05:44.878 --> 05:45.879
thinking that too?

05:45.879 --> 05:46.980
>> CANDIS: Totally.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.015
>> CAITLYN: For people in my

05:48.015 --> 05:49.650
community, that question of

05:49.650 --> 05:51.184
gender is in your head every

05:51.184 --> 05:53.120
day, all the time.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.187
I want all my kids, but

05:54.187 --> 05:55.523
especially Kendall and Kylie, to

05:55.523 --> 05:56.624
think about their gender.

05:56.624 --> 05:57.625
When did I know?

05:57.625 --> 05:58.626
You know?

05:58.626 --> 05:59.627
When was that?

05:59.627 --> 06:00.694
>> KYLIE: Well, you know what's

06:00.694 --> 06:01.929
so interesting is I feel like a

06:01.929 --> 06:04.932
year before her transition...

06:04.932 --> 06:06.233
I feel like there was just a lot

06:06.233 --> 06:08.436
on her mind, and we didn't

06:08.436 --> 06:09.737
really connect.

06:09.737 --> 06:10.938
Like, I feel like my whole life,

06:10.938 --> 06:12.940
it just wasn't genuine or...

06:12.940 --> 06:14.341
Now I feel like we connect a lot

06:14.341 --> 06:15.509
more and we spend a lot more

06:15.509 --> 06:16.944
time together.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.479
So I actually almost like it

06:18.479 --> 06:19.647
more.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.148
The only thing-- when I post

06:21.148 --> 06:22.983
photos of my dad or if I say

06:22.983 --> 06:24.485
"dad", people will be like, "You

06:24.485 --> 06:26.186
mean mom?"

06:26.186 --> 06:27.187
And I just want to be like,

06:27.187 --> 06:29.056
"Absolutely not", like...

06:29.056 --> 06:30.257
>> CHANDI: Absolutely not.

06:30.257 --> 06:31.659
>> KYLIE: That... Like, that is

06:31.659 --> 06:33.226
not my mom, you know?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.462
>> JENNY: I think that Caitlyn

06:34.462 --> 06:35.496
is cool with that, but for me,

06:35.496 --> 06:36.864
it made me a little crazy when

06:36.864 --> 06:38.499
my kids would say "dad" in,

06:38.499 --> 06:39.667
like, a public place, and I'd be

06:39.667 --> 06:40.968
like, "Oh..."

06:40.968 --> 06:42.470
But-but it's... but it's... In

06:42.470 --> 06:44.037
the end, we let them pick a

06:44.037 --> 06:45.673
name, and they came up with-with

06:45.673 --> 06:46.674
Maddie, you know?

06:46.674 --> 06:47.675
>> KENDALL: Yeah, her name in my

06:47.675 --> 06:48.175
phone is "Mad".

06:48.175 --> 06:49.176
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

06:49.176 --> 06:49.677
>> KYLIE: Yeah.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.678
>> KENDALL: 'Cause she-she's a

06:50.678 --> 06:52.713
little mad.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.714
Bye.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.715
>> CHANDI: Bye-bye.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.716
>> KENDALL: Hope to see you guys

06:55.716 --> 06:58.752
soon.

06:58.752 --> 06:59.753
>> CAITLYN: I'm glad you had a

06:59.753 --> 07:01.321
chance to meet all the girls.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.490
Really one of the most

07:02.490 --> 07:03.624
interesting group of girls

07:03.624 --> 07:04.625
you'll ever meet, you know?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.125
Love you.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.126
>> KENDALL: Bye, love you.

07:06.126 --> 07:07.127
>> CAITLYN: I'll be calling you

07:07.127 --> 07:09.497
from the road.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.531
>> JENNY: Are you psyched?

07:10.531 --> 07:11.532
>> CHANDI: Yeah, what's going

07:11.532 --> 07:12.533
on?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.034
You-you just seem like...

07:14.034 --> 07:15.102
>> CANDIS: No, I mean, I... the

07:15.102 --> 07:16.737
idea of it is so amazing.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.739
Um, I just... it's just, like,

07:18.739 --> 07:20.574
overwhelming, you know?

07:20.574 --> 07:21.709
>> CHANDI: Yeah.

07:21.709 --> 07:22.710
>> CANDIS: I do have a little

07:22.710 --> 07:24.512
apprehension because I know that

07:24.512 --> 07:27.147
it's not gonna all be, you know,

07:27.147 --> 07:29.082
rainbows and unicorns.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.418
We've seen the reaction, mostly

07:31.418 --> 07:33.521
within our community, at

07:33.521 --> 07:34.822
Caitlyn.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.524
Me and the girls have talked

07:36.524 --> 07:38.859
about giving Caitlyn a reality

07:38.859 --> 07:40.193
check-- educating her about

07:40.193 --> 07:41.294
certain things.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.796
So we're-we're gonna be hard on

07:42.796 --> 07:43.797
her, we're gonna tell her the

07:43.797 --> 07:46.099
truth, um, even though she might

07:46.099 --> 07:47.234
not like it.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.536
>> JENNY: It's up to us, her

07:48.536 --> 07:50.203
friends, to push her... to push

07:50.203 --> 07:51.605
her out of her comfort zone, to

07:51.605 --> 07:53.841
encourage her to look within.

07:53.841 --> 07:54.842
>> CANDIS: Right.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.276
>> CAITLYN: Candis, where's the

07:56.276 --> 07:58.546
map?

07:58.546 --> 07:59.547
You have the map.

07:59.547 --> 08:00.548
>> CANDIS: I have the map for

08:00.548 --> 08:01.549
the trip.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.550
>> CAITLYN: Okay, put it right

08:02.550 --> 08:03.551
there.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.919
Um, we have, starting here to

08:05.919 --> 08:06.920
the Grand Canyon, which will be

08:06.920 --> 08:07.921
tomorrow.

08:07.921 --> 08:08.922
And then off to Santa Fe.

08:08.922 --> 08:09.923
>> CHANDI: Cool.

08:09.923 --> 08:10.924
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

08:10.924 --> 08:11.925
>> CANDIS: We could go to

08:11.925 --> 08:12.926
Des Moines.

08:12.926 --> 08:13.927
>> CAITLYN: Ugh, no, we don't.

08:13.927 --> 08:14.928
>> CANDIS: Yeah, we do.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.797
The Democratic debates are going

08:16.797 --> 08:17.798
to be there.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.932
>> CHANDI: Yay! (whoops)

08:18.932 --> 08:19.933
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, yeah, right,

08:19.933 --> 08:20.934
right, right.

08:20.934 --> 08:21.935
They're all Democrats, I'm the

08:21.935 --> 08:23.904
only conservative Republican on

08:23.904 --> 08:26.306
the bus, and we are in an

08:26.306 --> 08:27.708
election year, so I think it's

08:27.708 --> 08:28.976
going to be kind of interesting,

08:28.976 --> 08:29.977
from that standpoint.

08:29.977 --> 08:30.978
>> KATE: How many months we

08:30.978 --> 08:31.979
gonna be on the road?

08:31.979 --> 08:33.981
>> CAITLYN: A long time, yeah.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.348
All right, early morning

08:35.348 --> 08:37.317
tomorrow.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.889
(birds chirping)

08:41.889 --> 08:43.423
>> JENNY: Careful.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.226
(laughs)

08:46.226 --> 08:47.595
>> CAITLYN: It is 6:30 in the

08:47.595 --> 08:49.262
morning-- unbelievably, we're on

08:49.262 --> 08:50.831
time.

08:50.831 --> 08:54.001
I've got a lot of stuff.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.836
We go pick up some more people,

08:55.836 --> 08:57.504
then we hop on the bus and we're

08:57.504 --> 09:00.207
off to the Grand Canyon.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.775
Should be fun.

09:02.810 --> 09:03.811
>> ELLA: No, no, no, this is

09:03.811 --> 09:05.445
not... This looks very bad, but

09:05.445 --> 09:06.747
my bags are only... these ones.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.148
So don't...

09:08.148 --> 09:09.149
>> CAITLYN: Do you have your

09:09.149 --> 09:09.650
wallet?

09:09.650 --> 09:10.651
>> COURTNEY: Kipsy, shut the

09:10.651 --> 09:11.885
door, and I was like, "Kipsy,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.854
I'm in here."

09:13.854 --> 09:15.288
*

09:15.288 --> 09:16.289
>> CAITLYN: There they are.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.490
>> KIP: Double trouble.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.759
>> JENNY: All aboard. Ready?

09:18.759 --> 09:19.860
(imitates train whistle)

09:19.860 --> 09:21.128
>> CAITLYN: Oh, no!

09:21.128 --> 09:22.930
>> JENNY: Here, blow in there.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.097
Just go...

09:24.097 --> 09:25.098
(imitates train whistle)

09:25.098 --> 09:25.633
(laughing)

09:25.633 --> 09:26.634
You want to blow?

09:26.634 --> 09:27.635
>> CAITLYN: Well, I can see it's

09:27.635 --> 09:28.636
gonna be tough.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.136
>> KIP: I do have...

09:29.136 --> 09:30.137
>> JENNY: I didn't mean this.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.338
(laughter)

09:31.338 --> 09:32.339
>> KIP: Oh, my paws and

09:32.339 --> 09:34.207
whiskers!

09:34.207 --> 09:35.275
>> WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,

09:35.275 --> 09:36.910
please welcome Candis Cayne.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.846
>> CAITLYN: Candis Cayne! Yay!

09:38.846 --> 09:41.849
Next-- Chandi...

09:41.849 --> 09:42.382
Zackary...

09:42.382 --> 09:43.383
>> KIP: And then we are out of

09:43.383 --> 09:44.384
town!

09:44.384 --> 09:45.385
>> ZACKARY: I love you.

09:45.385 --> 09:46.954
>> MAN: I love you, too.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.421
>> ZACKARY: I feel so fortunate

09:48.421 --> 09:51.424
to have a boyfriend who loves me

09:51.424 --> 09:53.260
and whom I love and who treats

09:53.260 --> 09:54.327
me amazing.

09:54.327 --> 09:55.495
But I know that that's the

09:55.495 --> 09:56.496
exception.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.498
Men who love transwomen come

09:58.498 --> 10:00.801
forward very rarely.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.070
>> CAITLYN: We have everybody!

10:03.070 --> 10:06.206
(cheering, whooping)

10:06.206 --> 10:07.340
Let's go get the big bus, and

10:07.340 --> 10:08.341
we're out of town!

10:08.341 --> 10:09.342
>> WOMAN: To the bus, to the

10:09.342 --> 10:09.843
bus!

10:09.843 --> 10:12.279
>> WOMAN 2: To... the... bus.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.546
>> CAITLYN: Let's go do it.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.615
>> ZACKARY: Wow!

10:15.615 --> 10:16.984
>> WOMAN: Oh, my God, there are

10:16.984 --> 10:18.185
sparkles.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.953
>> WOMAN 2: It's the glam!

10:19.953 --> 10:21.454
>> CHANDI: The bus is totally

10:21.454 --> 10:24.157
amazing, and being in that type

10:24.157 --> 10:26.359
of confinement, there's never

10:26.359 --> 10:28.095
gonna be anyplace for Cait to

10:28.095 --> 10:29.562
run on this trip.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.931
Being around so many girls for

10:30.931 --> 10:33.400
that length of time is going to

10:33.400 --> 10:36.536
make her or break her.

10:36.536 --> 10:38.538
(whooping, clapping)

10:38.538 --> 10:42.209
>> WOMAN 2: Grand Canyon!

10:42.209 --> 10:43.343
>> ZACKARY: You look stunning,

10:43.343 --> 10:44.344
honey.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.046
>> CHANDI: As usual.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.047
(shutter clicks)

10:47.047 --> 10:48.816
>> CAITLYN: Oh, Zackary, no way

10:48.816 --> 10:50.217
you can put individual lashes on

10:50.217 --> 10:51.618
in a bus.

10:51.618 --> 10:52.786
>> ZACKARY: You've got to be

10:52.786 --> 10:53.954
able to paint yourself out of a

10:53.954 --> 10:55.255
box.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.757
It's a necessary survival

10:56.757 --> 10:58.425
strategy.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.828
(laughing)

11:00.828 --> 11:02.595
(train whistle blows)

11:02.595 --> 11:03.731
>> WOMAN: We're about to have

11:03.731 --> 11:04.732
some serious girl talk.

11:04.732 --> 11:05.733
>> ZACKARY: Okay.

11:05.733 --> 11:07.400
I can't imagine actually being

11:07.400 --> 11:09.970
18 years old and having, like,

11:09.970 --> 11:11.939
your first romance.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.273
>> ELLA: My boyfriend is

11:13.273 --> 11:15.175
amazing.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.977
It's really nice to have

11:16.977 --> 11:19.579
someone, like... understand.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.881
>> CANDIS: Everybody has a

11:20.881 --> 11:22.115
boyfriend but me.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.316
(laughing): I'm the old

11:23.316 --> 11:25.886
battle-ax that has no boyfriend.

11:25.886 --> 11:26.954
(fake snoring)

11:26.954 --> 11:27.955
>> JENNY: We're approaching

11:27.955 --> 11:28.455
lunch.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.456
>> CAITLYN: I'd like to stop

11:29.456 --> 11:30.457
somewhere, like in the middle of

11:30.457 --> 11:31.124
nowhere...

11:31.124 --> 11:32.125
>> WOMAN: Yeah, let's do it.

11:32.125 --> 11:33.126
>> CAITLYN: ...and take over

11:33.126 --> 11:33.626
some restaurant.

11:33.626 --> 11:34.627
>> WOMAN: Let's take over!

11:34.627 --> 11:37.397
>> WOMAN 2: Yes!

11:37.397 --> 11:38.966
>> CAITLYN: Let's go do it!

11:38.966 --> 11:40.934
It's the River Cafe, guys.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.903
>> WOMAN: Juicy's Famous.

11:50.077 --> 11:52.045
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.383
>> WOMAN: I'll follow you.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.518
(knocking)

11:58.518 --> 12:02.155
>> CHANDI: Hey!

12:02.155 --> 12:03.490
>> CANDIS: Oh! We're in Needles.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.491
>> WOMAN: Isn't that better?

12:04.491 --> 12:05.893
You're in Needles.

12:05.893 --> 12:08.161
(knocking)

12:08.161 --> 12:10.130
(laughs)

12:12.800 --> 12:14.401
>> WOMAN: Where is Chandi?

12:14.401 --> 12:15.803
>> WOMAN 2: Where is Chandi?

12:15.803 --> 12:17.037
>> JENNY: Did she not get off

12:17.037 --> 12:18.038
the bus?

12:18.038 --> 12:19.639
>> WOMAN: Oh, sorry, sorry...

12:19.639 --> 12:20.808
I trapped you in there for so

12:20.808 --> 12:21.241
long.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.475
>> CHANDI: Oh, my goodness!

12:22.475 --> 12:23.944
(laughs)

12:23.944 --> 12:26.013
I'm off the bus! Yay!

12:26.013 --> 12:27.447
>> WOMAN: There she is!

12:27.447 --> 12:29.249
(happy shouts)

12:29.249 --> 12:30.250
>> CHANDI: I could not get off

12:30.250 --> 12:30.918
the bus.

12:30.918 --> 12:31.919
I was freaking out.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.020
>> CAITLYN: You were locked on

12:33.020 --> 12:34.087
the bus?

12:34.087 --> 12:35.088
>> CHANDI: People were moving

12:35.088 --> 12:38.325
around, and I'm like, "Hey...!"

12:38.325 --> 12:39.626
Nobody could hear me.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.828
Everybody was just waving.

12:40.828 --> 12:41.829
So then I'm like...

12:41.829 --> 12:43.263
>> COURTNEY: A soundproof bus!

12:43.263 --> 12:44.431
>> CHANDI: Damn.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.399
>> CANDIS: Damn.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.103
>> CAITLYN: On the bus!

12:50.103 --> 12:51.238
Load 'em up!

12:51.238 --> 12:52.405
>> WOMAN: On the road again.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.341
>> WOMAN 2: Home sweet home.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.008
Ah...

12:55.008 --> 12:56.844
>> CAITLYN: We got wine, beer...

12:56.844 --> 12:58.378
>> CHANDI: That's just what the

12:58.378 --> 12:59.379
doctor ordered.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.380
>> CAITLYN: Let the conversation

13:00.380 --> 13:01.448
begin.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.416
We're rolling.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.419
(cheering, whooping, shouting)

13:06.419 --> 13:07.754
>> JENNY: This bus trip was

13:07.754 --> 13:09.857
Caitlyn's idea.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.925
I think part of her motivation

13:11.925 --> 13:13.093
was she thought it was gonna be

13:13.093 --> 13:14.094
fun.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.195
And, of course, it is fun, but

13:15.195 --> 13:16.729
it's about more than having fun.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.431
She needs to realize she's not

13:18.431 --> 13:19.967
gonna get a pass anymore, that

13:19.967 --> 13:21.368
some of the hardest work for her

13:21.368 --> 13:23.670
lies ahead.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.105
>> CAITLYN: Uh-oh.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.273
When she gets this close...

13:26.273 --> 13:27.274
>> COURTNEY: Scoot over.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.275
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, when she gets

13:28.275 --> 13:29.276
this close, this is not good.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.277
>> COURTNEY: Are you getting

13:30.277 --> 13:30.777
nervous?

13:30.777 --> 13:31.778
>> CAITLYN: I'm getting nervous.

13:31.778 --> 13:32.779
>> JENNY: Cait, there's

13:32.779 --> 13:33.780
something I wanted to ask you

13:33.780 --> 13:34.781
about, and I don't quite know

13:34.781 --> 13:35.983
how to get in here.

13:35.983 --> 13:36.984
>> CAITLYN: All right.

13:36.984 --> 13:37.985
>> JENNY: I think you said...

13:37.985 --> 13:38.651
>> CAITLYN: Uh-oh.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.320
>> JENNY: ...um, the other day

13:40.320 --> 13:41.788
that you consider yourself

13:41.788 --> 13:45.658
heterosexual.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.961
When you were a straight guy, so

13:47.961 --> 13:48.962
to speak...

13:48.962 --> 13:49.963
>> CAITLYN: So to speak.

13:49.963 --> 13:50.964
>> JENNY (laughs): So to speak.

13:50.964 --> 13:53.233
Um, did you ever appreciate what

13:53.233 --> 13:55.535
was beautiful about other men?

13:55.535 --> 13:56.536
Was that on your radar?

13:56.536 --> 13:57.204
>> CAITLYN: Other men?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.205
>> JENNY: Yeah. Was on that your

13:58.205 --> 13:58.705
radar?

13:58.705 --> 13:59.706
Did you... could you see men?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.108
I'm not asking you to make you

14:01.108 --> 14:03.243
uncomfortable.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.045
Six months in, I remember

14:05.045 --> 14:06.446
feeling like I was seeing men

14:06.446 --> 14:07.714
for the first time.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.282
Whing! You know, something in me

14:09.282 --> 14:12.019
suddenly was-was... thrilled by

14:12.019 --> 14:14.254
men.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.255
>> CAITLYN: Have you ever been

14:15.255 --> 14:15.755
with a guy?

14:15.755 --> 14:16.756
>> JENNY: No.

14:16.756 --> 14:17.757
>> WOMAN: Have you?

14:17.757 --> 14:18.758
>> CAITLYN: You didn't have the

14:18.758 --> 14:19.993
guts to-- oh, don't go like this

14:19.993 --> 14:20.994
with me.

14:20.994 --> 14:21.494
(laughter)

14:21.494 --> 14:22.495
>> COURTNEY: Oh, well, I'm so

14:22.495 --> 14:23.496
sorry!

14:23.496 --> 14:24.497
>> CAITLYN: My question's to

14:24.497 --> 14:25.498
her.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.666
No, I never have.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.068
>> CHANDI: If you were to date

14:28.068 --> 14:29.436
someone female, because that's

14:29.436 --> 14:31.304
what you're attracted to, would

14:31.304 --> 14:32.472
you consider yourself to be

14:32.472 --> 14:33.773
lesbian?

14:33.773 --> 14:36.043
>> CAITLYN: Uh...

14:36.043 --> 14:37.044
Boy, this gets heavy.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.111
>> WOMAN: It does.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.112
>> CAITLYN: Um, I'm trying to

14:39.112 --> 14:40.413
think all this out.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.781
Talking about my sexuality's

14:41.781 --> 14:43.283
really difficult for me, and I

14:43.283 --> 14:44.784
want to literally shrivel up and

14:44.784 --> 14:46.686
just kind of hide inside me.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.288
I really don't want to go there,

14:48.288 --> 14:50.223
but I am totally outnumbered in

14:50.223 --> 14:51.258
this bus.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.559
To be honest with you, I

14:52.559 --> 14:55.595
can't... see myself dating,

14:55.595 --> 14:58.966
like, women in the future.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.834
>> WOMAN: Wow.

15:01.834 --> 15:02.835
>> CAITLYN: Do you know your way

15:02.835 --> 15:03.836
around men?

15:03.836 --> 15:05.272
>> CANDIS: I do a little bit.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.273
>> CAITLYN: If we go on, like, a

15:06.273 --> 15:08.075
double date, what about our

15:08.075 --> 15:09.076
affair?

15:09.076 --> 15:11.411
Like, would it be over?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.579
>> WOMAN: You're telling me

15:12.579 --> 15:13.846
Republicans support rights for

15:13.846 --> 15:15.115
transgender people?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.349
>> CAITLYN: Every conservative

15:16.349 --> 15:17.517
guy out there believes in

15:17.517 --> 15:18.518
everybody's rights.

15:18.518 --> 15:19.519
>> JENNY: That is never gonna

15:19.519 --> 15:21.488
happen.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.325
>> CAITLYN: To be honest with

15:25.325 --> 15:28.128
you, I can't... see myself

15:28.128 --> 15:29.796
dating, like, women in the

15:29.796 --> 15:30.797
future.

15:30.797 --> 15:31.298
>> WOMAN: Wow.

15:31.298 --> 15:32.299
>> WOMAN 2: Wow.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.300
>> CAITLYN: I just... I've been

15:33.300 --> 15:34.301
there, done that.

15:34.301 --> 15:34.801
>> CHANDI: Right.

15:34.801 --> 15:35.802
>> CAITLYN: Got three very

15:35.802 --> 15:36.803
strong ex-wives.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.371
I just don't see it.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.372
>> JENNY: So now you can have an

15:39.372 --> 15:39.872
ex-husband.

15:39.872 --> 15:40.873
>> CAITLYN: That's right, now I

15:40.873 --> 15:41.474
can have an ex-husband.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.475
>> JENNY: That's something to

15:42.475 --> 15:43.476
look forward to.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.011
>> CAITLYN: Um...

15:44.011 --> 15:45.412
>> COURTNEY: Well, maybe now you

15:45.412 --> 15:47.380
are that, so you don't need to

15:47.380 --> 15:49.116
be that or be around, you know?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.183
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. And I don't

15:50.183 --> 15:51.318
see a woman being attracted to

15:51.318 --> 15:51.884
me, so... you know...

15:51.884 --> 15:52.885
>> COURTNEY: Oh, they're

15:52.885 --> 15:53.386
attracted to you.

15:53.386 --> 15:54.387
>> WOMAN: Oh, you'd be

15:54.387 --> 15:55.388
surprised.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.024
>> JENNY: I beg your pardon.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.158
>> WOMAN: There might be women

15:58.158 --> 15:59.226
in this room who are attracted

15:59.226 --> 16:00.227
to you, Caitlyn.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.661
>> CAITLYN: Oh, they're in here!

16:01.661 --> 16:03.096
(laughter)

16:03.096 --> 16:04.264
>> COURTNEY: That's big.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.465
You have never-- that's big,

16:05.465 --> 16:06.566
'cause you've never said that

16:06.566 --> 16:07.567
before.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.835
But this morning my boyfriend

16:08.835 --> 16:10.270
dropped me off and he, like,

16:10.270 --> 16:11.438
goes around and he's like, "Cait

16:11.438 --> 16:12.839
needs to roll her window up in

16:12.839 --> 16:14.207
her car before she leaves, it's

16:14.207 --> 16:16.343
gonna rain," and she goes, "I'd

16:16.343 --> 16:18.245
like that, I got to get me one

16:18.245 --> 16:19.412
of those."

16:19.412 --> 16:20.780
She said, "I got to get me one

16:20.780 --> 16:22.049
of those," and I was like...

16:22.049 --> 16:23.683
I think you were attracted to,

16:23.683 --> 16:25.818
like, that, like somebody who's

16:25.818 --> 16:27.087
just doing... taking care of it

16:27.087 --> 16:28.088
and, like...

16:28.088 --> 16:29.089
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, right, yeah,

16:29.089 --> 16:31.724
yeah, there is factors of that.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.060
To be honest, if I was in a

16:33.060 --> 16:34.927
relationship with a guy, I would

16:34.927 --> 16:36.896
enjoy being treated like that--

16:36.896 --> 16:39.666
opening doors for you, uh, doing

16:39.666 --> 16:40.767
all what you would think the

16:40.767 --> 16:42.402
traditional stuff in a

16:42.402 --> 16:43.770
guy-and-a-girl relationship.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.971
It'd have to be a very special

16:44.971 --> 16:46.606
guy to be able to do that, but,

16:46.606 --> 16:48.375
uh... yeah, I would be open to

16:48.375 --> 16:49.376
that.

16:49.376 --> 16:50.877
>> KATE: What tickles us isn't

16:50.877 --> 16:52.179
always the gender of our

16:52.179 --> 16:53.446
partner.

16:53.446 --> 16:54.514
It might be, you know, like,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.983
sapiosexuals are all into people

16:56.983 --> 16:58.385
who are smart, you know?

16:58.385 --> 16:59.686
There are people who are into

16:59.686 --> 17:01.088
power.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.090
Like, there's a powerful person,

17:03.090 --> 17:04.091
I don't care what gender they

17:04.091 --> 17:04.524
are.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.093
>> CAITLYN: In most cases, I've

17:06.093 --> 17:07.627
been attracted to powerful

17:07.627 --> 17:08.695
girls.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.696
>> KATE: Okay.

17:09.696 --> 17:10.697
>> CAITLYN: I've always been

17:10.697 --> 17:11.831
with very strong women.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.300
If there was a female in my

17:13.300 --> 17:15.168
life, it would be more like a

17:15.168 --> 17:17.904
friendship than it would be... a

17:17.904 --> 17:19.639
real, you know, a serious

17:19.639 --> 17:20.940
relationship.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.109
You would never have these

17:22.109 --> 17:23.810
conversations anywhere else but

17:23.810 --> 17:25.445
in this bus.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.247
Yeah. With everybody being so

17:27.247 --> 17:29.216
open.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.123
>> WOMAN: Are we, like, here?

17:36.123 --> 17:37.324
>> CHANDI: We should be.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.325
>> WOMAN: All right, let's go.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.659
>> WOMAN 2: Is it cold out?

17:39.659 --> 17:40.660
>> CAITLYN: I think I got

17:40.660 --> 17:41.661
everything.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.131
(indistinct chatter)

17:44.131 --> 17:45.132
>> CAITLYN: A little chilly.

17:45.132 --> 17:46.133
>> CANDIS: Welcome to the Grand

17:46.133 --> 17:46.633
Canyon.

17:46.633 --> 17:47.634
Are you gonna stay in for the

17:47.634 --> 17:48.135
night?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.136
>> CAITLYN: I am, uh, not going

17:49.136 --> 17:49.636
anywhere.

17:49.636 --> 17:50.703
>> CANDIS: Thank you.

17:50.703 --> 17:51.371
>> CAITLYN: Thank you.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.305
>> CANDIS: All right.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.039
>> CAITLYN: I will see you in a

17:53.039 --> 17:53.706
bit.

17:53.706 --> 17:54.507
>> ZACKARY: Sweet dreams, Mama.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.343
>> CAITLYN: All right.

17:56.343 --> 17:58.511
Okay, I said what everybody

17:58.511 --> 18:00.380
wants to hear, that, yeah, I

18:00.380 --> 18:01.448
would date a man.

18:01.448 --> 18:02.449
I, you know...

18:02.449 --> 18:03.516
And it's kind of nice just to

18:03.516 --> 18:05.585
get that kind of off your chest.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.154
Maybe now they might leave me

18:07.154 --> 18:09.189
alone for a while.

18:09.189 --> 18:12.159
(crickets chirping)

18:12.159 --> 18:13.260
>> CANDIS: Have this whole

18:13.260 --> 18:14.594
piece, 'cause I'm done.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.862
So you need to eat that whole

18:15.862 --> 18:17.029
gorgeous piece.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.598
Right there. It's all...

18:18.598 --> 18:19.999
No, take the piece, (bleep) damn

18:19.999 --> 18:21.168
it.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.435
Take the (bleep) piece.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.205
Thank you.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.073
>> JENNY: So, can I just say?

18:27.073 --> 18:28.074
That was kind of an amazing bus

18:28.074 --> 18:29.442
ride, an amazing conversation we

18:29.442 --> 18:30.443
had.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.844
>> CANDIS: Yeah, it was fun.

18:31.844 --> 18:32.845
>> JENNY: W-Was I the only one

18:32.845 --> 18:34.347
who was caught a little off

18:34.347 --> 18:36.349
guard by Caitlyn allowing us how

18:36.349 --> 18:39.186
she sees men in her future?

18:39.186 --> 18:40.320
>> CANDIS: Yeah, that was

18:40.320 --> 18:41.321
interesting.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.422
'Cause I always just assumed

18:42.422 --> 18:44.191
because she's been with women

18:44.191 --> 18:45.692
that that's who she would...

18:45.692 --> 18:46.759
>> ELLA: I was definitely kind

18:46.759 --> 18:48.295
of like...

18:48.295 --> 18:49.429
>> JENNY: Boy, it was like...

18:49.429 --> 18:50.597
>> ELLA: "Wow."

18:50.597 --> 18:51.598
>> JENNY: She did not want to go

18:51.598 --> 18:52.599
there, and I felt bad pushing

18:52.599 --> 18:53.600
her so hard.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.601
I really don't like doing that

18:54.601 --> 18:55.602
with her.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.603
On the other hand, I feel like

18:56.603 --> 18:58.070
this is the journey that we're

18:58.070 --> 19:00.507
on.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.908
>> ELLA: But, see, you got her

19:01.908 --> 19:03.343
to say something she hasn't

19:03.343 --> 19:04.511
said.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.978
You know? I-I would have never

19:05.978 --> 19:07.013
guessed.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.014
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.015
>> JENNY: Maybe it sounds like

19:09.015 --> 19:10.283
I'm harshing on her, but Caitlyn

19:10.283 --> 19:11.718
often gives us that, you know,

19:11.718 --> 19:12.719
"I don't want to go there.

19:12.719 --> 19:13.720
Don't go there.

19:13.720 --> 19:14.721
I don't want to talk about it."

19:14.721 --> 19:15.722
And then she'll just kind of,

19:15.722 --> 19:17.224
you know, flit away.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.425
Well, she can't do that anymore,

19:18.425 --> 19:20.793
and it's up to us, her friends,

19:20.793 --> 19:24.597
to keep pushing to... find some

19:24.597 --> 19:26.233
answers to questions she may not

19:26.233 --> 19:30.537
have asked herself yet.

19:30.537 --> 19:31.538
>> CAITLYN: The Democratic

19:31.538 --> 19:32.705
National Debate.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.840
>> CANDIS: Great. Front row!

19:33.840 --> 19:34.841
(chuckles)

19:34.841 --> 19:35.842
>> CAITLYN: The last place I

19:35.842 --> 19:36.843
want to be.

19:36.843 --> 19:37.844
>> CHANDI: I know. I know.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.011
>> CAITLYN: And if we're

19:39.011 --> 19:40.046
unfortunate enough to get

19:40.046 --> 19:41.248
Hillary as our next president,

19:41.248 --> 19:42.249
we need her on our side.

19:42.249 --> 19:42.882
>> CHANDI: Right.

19:42.882 --> 19:43.883
>> CAITLYN: Although she won't

19:43.883 --> 19:44.684
be.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.352
>> JENNY: Which Republican

19:45.352 --> 19:46.085
would?

19:46.085 --> 19:47.086
>> CAITLYN: She could care less

19:47.086 --> 19:47.887
about women.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.657
She cares about herself.

19:50.657 --> 19:51.691
>> JENNY: I think we're at a

19:51.691 --> 19:52.859
tipping point now where the

19:52.859 --> 19:54.827
religious right and some

19:54.827 --> 19:56.263
socialist conservatives are

19:56.263 --> 19:57.997
using fear of people like us to

19:57.997 --> 20:00.833
repeal and to prevent equality.

20:00.833 --> 20:01.834
>> CAITLYN: Oh, please.

20:01.834 --> 20:02.835
It's not... Don't go there.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.103
Just as much the Democrats.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.104
With me...

20:05.104 --> 20:06.105
>> JENNY: You need to look at

20:06.105 --> 20:07.106
it, Cait.

20:07.106 --> 20:08.107
>> CAITLYN: No, I'm not gonna

20:08.107 --> 20:09.108
identify that.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.109
I'm not blaming it on

20:10.109 --> 20:12.879
Republicans and conservatives.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.349
>> CANDIS: Good morning!

20:16.349 --> 20:17.417
>> CAITLYN: Morning!

20:17.417 --> 20:18.585
>> CANDIS: I'm so excited about

20:18.585 --> 20:19.586
seeing the Grand Canyon.

20:19.586 --> 20:20.587
>> CAITLYN: Of course. Who

20:20.587 --> 20:21.588
wouldn't be excited?

20:21.588 --> 20:22.789
>> CANDIS: I have never seen it.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.923
>> CAITLYN: I am. I'm... I've

20:23.923 --> 20:24.924
never seen it either. Yeah.

20:24.924 --> 20:25.658
>> CANDIS: I think it'll be

20:25.658 --> 20:26.326
good.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.059
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, no, I'm

20:27.059 --> 20:27.727
actually very excited.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.728
>> CANDIS: We made it here.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.529
The bus ride was fun.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.530
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

20:30.530 --> 20:31.531
>> CANDIS: And I'm super proud

20:31.531 --> 20:32.532
of you for opening up and-and,

20:32.532 --> 20:33.533
like...

20:33.533 --> 20:34.534
>> CAITLYN: Jesus Christ, I have

20:34.534 --> 20:35.535
no choice.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.536
>> CANDIS: Well, just a little

20:36.536 --> 20:37.537
bit.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.538
I know. But you're with all

20:38.538 --> 20:39.539
these girls, and everybody was

20:39.539 --> 20:41.207
kind of like... (growls)

20:41.207 --> 20:42.509
Which, you know, you handled it

20:42.509 --> 20:43.676
really well.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.077
And now maybe you and I can go

20:45.077 --> 20:46.212
out on a double date.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.814
(laughs)

20:47.814 --> 20:48.815
>> CAITLYN: At this point, what

20:48.815 --> 20:49.816
the hell?

20:49.816 --> 20:50.817
>> CANDIS: Why not?

20:50.817 --> 20:52.051
>> CAITLYN: Why not? D-Double

20:52.051 --> 20:53.420
date, yes.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.187
Do you know your way around men?

20:55.187 --> 20:56.188
>> CANDIS: I do, a little bit.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.223
>> CAITLYN: Okay, good.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.625
But here's the big question.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.626
>> CANDIS: What?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.461
>> CAITLYN: If we go on, like, a

21:01.461 --> 21:03.530
double date with, like, guys...

21:03.530 --> 21:04.531
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

21:04.531 --> 21:05.532
>> CAITLYN: ...what about our

21:05.532 --> 21:06.533
affair?

21:06.533 --> 21:07.734
Like, would it be over?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.868
>> CANDIS: Well, I mean...

21:08.868 --> 21:09.869
>> CAITLYN: I mean, the tabloids

21:09.869 --> 21:10.870
have been running wild with this

21:10.870 --> 21:11.871
stuff.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.005
Everybody has been pushing right

21:13.005 --> 21:14.341
from the beginning Candis and I

21:14.341 --> 21:15.342
getting together.

21:15.342 --> 21:16.676
And I love her to death, but I

21:16.676 --> 21:18.345
don't see the relationship, from

21:18.345 --> 21:20.246
my standpoint, going any farther

21:20.246 --> 21:21.247
than what it's, you know...

21:21.247 --> 21:22.248
where it is right now.

21:22.248 --> 21:23.249
>> CANDIS: To the end of our

21:23.249 --> 21:24.250
affair.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.251
>> CAITLYN: No.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.786
(Candis laughs)

21:26.786 --> 21:28.120
All girls have girlfriends,

21:28.120 --> 21:29.356
right?

21:29.356 --> 21:30.357
You know, Candis will always be

21:30.357 --> 21:31.924
in my life.

21:31.924 --> 21:33.092
>> ZACKARY: Good morning.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.394
Oh, my God, everybody looks so

21:34.394 --> 21:36.363
fresh and so beautiful.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.364
>> CAITLYN: I know. Isn't that

21:37.364 --> 21:40.633
great?

21:40.633 --> 21:42.702
We just got a-a court ruling.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.236
Kind of on the bathroom and

21:44.236 --> 21:45.672
changing and this and that.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.575
This girl in Chicago identifies

21:48.575 --> 21:50.577
as female, but they just had a

21:50.577 --> 21:51.578
big article in The New York

21:51.578 --> 21:52.679
Times today.

21:52.679 --> 21:53.680
>> JENNY: "Federal education

21:53.680 --> 21:54.814
authorities found that an

21:54.814 --> 21:55.882
Illinois school district

21:55.882 --> 21:57.249
violated antidiscrimination laws

21:57.249 --> 21:58.751
when it did not allow a

21:58.751 --> 22:00.186
transgender girl who identifies

22:00.186 --> 22:01.754
as a girl and participates on a

22:01.754 --> 22:03.623
girls' sports team to change and

22:03.623 --> 22:04.957
shower in the girls' locker room

22:04.957 --> 22:06.959
without restrictions.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.795
Education officials say the

22:08.795 --> 22:09.996
decision is the first of its

22:09.996 --> 22:11.498
kind on the rights of

22:11.498 --> 22:12.665
transgender students, which are

22:12.665 --> 22:14.033
emerging as a new cultural

22:14.033 --> 22:15.034
battleground."

22:15.034 --> 22:15.902
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

22:15.902 --> 22:17.069
(cheering)

22:17.069 --> 22:18.938
>> JENNY: Ah, love that.

22:18.938 --> 22:19.939
>> CAITLYN: That's good, it's

22:19.939 --> 22:21.273
all good.

22:21.273 --> 22:22.642
That's progress for us.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.776
And it starts small and

22:23.776 --> 22:25.044
hopefully will spread.

22:25.044 --> 22:28.247
My goal is to make a difference

22:28.247 --> 22:29.649
for the next generation.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.551
This is part of humanity, and I

22:31.551 --> 22:33.753
want it to be treated that way.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.455
Did you guys get your orders in?

22:35.455 --> 22:36.789
>> ZACKARY: Yeah.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.790
>> CAITLYN: Now, Ella, what are

22:37.790 --> 22:38.791
you doing about... Are you

22:38.791 --> 22:40.427
continuing on in school or what?

22:40.427 --> 22:41.428
>> ELLA: I think if I'm going to

22:41.428 --> 22:42.429
pursue school, I definitely need

22:42.429 --> 22:43.430
some time to just, like, you

22:43.430 --> 22:44.431
know, take off...

22:44.431 --> 22:45.432
>> CAITLYN: Live your life.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.433
>> ELLA: Yeah.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.434
>> JENNY: I don't know what your

22:47.434 --> 22:48.435
experience with high school is

22:48.435 --> 22:49.436
like.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.637
I know for a lot of trans people

22:50.637 --> 22:52.605
school, including for me, school

22:52.605 --> 22:53.873
was really horrible.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.475
>> ELLA: I was very lucky to

22:55.475 --> 22:57.877
have the school behind my back.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.579
In a little cute town right

22:59.579 --> 23:02.048
outside L.A. that is kind of

23:02.048 --> 23:03.683
familiar to difference in one

23:03.683 --> 23:04.884
way or another.

23:04.884 --> 23:05.885
I was definitely one of the

23:05.885 --> 23:07.019
fir... I think the first person

23:07.019 --> 23:09.522
to kind of bring this up.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.523
>> CAITLYN: Wore a dress for the

23:10.523 --> 23:11.758
first time to school at the

23:11.758 --> 23:12.759
prom.

23:12.759 --> 23:13.760
>> ZACKARY: At the prom.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.061
I wore a dress to my prom

23:15.061 --> 23:17.296
I wasn't, like...

23:17.296 --> 23:19.231
>> CAITLYN: Yay!

23:19.231 --> 23:20.467
>> JENNY: The experiences people

23:20.467 --> 23:21.568
have in schools now are so all

23:21.568 --> 23:23.069
over the place.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.471
Was it St. Louis where-where a

23:24.471 --> 23:26.205
school board allowed a trans

23:26.205 --> 23:28.207
girl to play on the women's

23:28.207 --> 23:29.742
team, and the students

23:29.742 --> 23:32.845
protested.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.080
It's just so different,

23:34.080 --> 23:35.081
depending on where you are.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.683
And-and being able to live your

23:36.683 --> 23:38.284
life with dignity should not be

23:38.284 --> 23:40.186
a matter of geography.

23:40.186 --> 23:41.187
>> CHANDI: Right.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.188
>> JENNY: Right?

23:42.188 --> 23:43.189
>> ELLA: It's sad.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.791
>> JENNY: Laws are different

23:44.791 --> 23:46.292
from state to state regarding

23:46.292 --> 23:47.694
transgender people, and a lot of

23:47.694 --> 23:50.497
how you live in this world as a

23:50.497 --> 23:52.331
trans person is dependent upon

23:52.331 --> 23:53.533
the community you find yourself

23:53.533 --> 23:54.534
in.

23:54.534 --> 23:55.535
I think it's one reason we need

23:55.535 --> 23:58.037
to pass nationwide laws

23:58.037 --> 23:59.506
protecting our people.

23:59.506 --> 24:00.507
We've made tremendous progress

24:00.507 --> 24:01.674
over the last five years, but

24:01.674 --> 24:03.510
there are many, many people who

24:03.510 --> 24:05.077
still just don't get it and

24:05.077 --> 24:07.814
still wish we'd go away.

24:07.814 --> 24:09.215
>> CANDIS: I think that we need

24:09.215 --> 24:10.216
to stop and maybe talk to

24:10.216 --> 24:11.217
Hillary.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.218
>> CAITLYN: Democratic National

24:12.218 --> 24:13.219
Debate.

24:13.219 --> 24:14.220
>> CHANDI: Right.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.221
>> CANDIS: Can't wait. Front

24:15.221 --> 24:16.222
row!

24:16.222 --> 24:17.289
(laughter)

24:17.289 --> 24:18.958
>> CHANDI: We're so excited that

24:18.958 --> 24:20.527
Cait's even gonna go.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.661
>> CANDIS: I'm excited for Cait.

24:21.661 --> 24:22.895
>> CHANDI: Right. And sit and

24:22.895 --> 24:23.896
listen to the Democrats.

24:23.896 --> 24:24.897
>> CAITLYN: It's the last place

24:24.897 --> 24:25.898
I want to be.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.166
>> CHANDI: I know. I know.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.135
One of those things

24:29.135 --> 24:31.070
you're-you're being open to and

24:31.070 --> 24:32.972
listening to...

24:32.972 --> 24:33.973
>> CAITLYN: We need both sides.

24:33.973 --> 24:34.974
>> CHANDI: Right. We need both

24:34.974 --> 24:35.975
sides.

24:35.975 --> 24:36.976
>> CAITLYN: And if we're

24:36.976 --> 24:37.977
unfortunate enough to get

24:37.977 --> 24:39.245
Hillary as our next president,

24:39.245 --> 24:40.980
we need her on our side.

24:40.980 --> 24:41.981
>> CHANDI: Right.

24:41.981 --> 24:42.982
>> CAITLYN: Although she won't

24:42.982 --> 24:43.983
be.

24:43.983 --> 24:44.984
>> JENNY: Which Republican

24:44.984 --> 24:45.985
would?

24:45.985 --> 24:46.986
>> CAITLYN: She could care less

24:46.986 --> 24:47.987
about women.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.055
She cares about herself.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.056
>> JENNY: Which-which Republican

24:50.056 --> 24:51.057
candidate do you think would be

24:51.057 --> 24:52.058
most supportive of transgendered

24:52.058 --> 24:53.059
people?

24:53.059 --> 24:55.027
>> CAITLYN: Um... all of them.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.063
(Chandi laughs)

24:57.063 --> 24:58.798
Yeah. They don't...

24:58.798 --> 25:00.867
The Republi... "Oh, I hate

25:00.867 --> 25:02.268
trans people" or "I hate gays."

25:02.268 --> 25:03.269
And you don't... nothing of

25:03.269 --> 25:04.270
that.

25:04.270 --> 25:05.672
They do more, "I want every... I

25:05.672 --> 25:07.473
want a thriving economy so every

25:07.473 --> 25:11.678
trans person has a job."

25:11.678 --> 25:14.581
>> CANDIS: (sighs) Caitlyn, what

25:14.581 --> 25:15.915
am I gonna do?

25:15.915 --> 25:17.684
I-I don't understand why she

25:17.684 --> 25:19.586
thinks that.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.253
That doesn't make sense to me.

25:21.253 --> 25:23.690
Democrats are more open to

25:23.690 --> 25:25.925
transgendered views.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.595
And, in general, Republicans are

25:28.595 --> 25:30.930
more conservative about that and

25:30.930 --> 25:32.398
they don't want to give LGBT

25:32.398 --> 25:36.803
rights to our community.

25:36.803 --> 25:37.804
>> CAITLYN: Another adventure.

25:37.804 --> 25:38.805
>> CANDIS: Yes.

25:38.805 --> 25:39.806
>> CHANDI: We're off to the

25:39.806 --> 25:40.807
races.

25:40.807 --> 25:41.874
>> ELLA: Oh, my gosh.

25:41.874 --> 25:42.875
>> CHANDI: Let's do this.

25:42.875 --> 25:44.911
(squealing, laughing)

25:44.911 --> 25:46.746
>> CANDIS: Like a Disney ride!

25:46.746 --> 25:48.047
>> ZACKARY: Oh, my God.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.616
>> CAITLYN: One day, this guy

25:49.616 --> 25:50.717
comes running up behind me and

25:50.717 --> 25:52.118
he goes, "Oh, I just love trans

25:52.118 --> 25:53.252
women."

25:53.252 --> 25:54.253
>> KATE: This whole notion of

25:54.253 --> 25:55.722
chasers has got to get out of

25:55.722 --> 25:59.158
the field of being perverted.

26:00.526 --> 26:03.262
(wind blowing)

26:03.262 --> 26:04.263
>> MAN: Hello.

26:04.263 --> 26:05.264
>> CAITLYN: How you doing today?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.265
Are you freezing?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.266
>> MAN: I'm not. I want to shake

26:07.266 --> 26:08.267
your hand.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.268
>> CAITLYN: Well, nice to meet

26:09.268 --> 26:10.269
you. How are you?

26:10.269 --> 26:11.270
>> MAN: You were an idol of mine

26:11.270 --> 26:12.271
back in the '70s.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.272
>> CAITLYN: Back in the old

26:13.272 --> 26:14.273
days, huh?

26:14.273 --> 26:15.742
So much fun on this trip to just

26:15.742 --> 26:17.910
be out meeting people, shaking

26:17.910 --> 26:18.911
hands.

26:18.911 --> 26:19.912
Well, we're open to people's

26:19.912 --> 26:20.913
minds now.

26:20.913 --> 26:21.914
>> MAN: There you go.

26:21.914 --> 26:22.915
>> CAITLYN: There you go.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.351
These people are just nice, fun.

26:25.351 --> 26:26.552
I'm having a great time.

26:26.552 --> 26:27.654
Nice meeting you.

26:27.654 --> 26:28.888
I love it.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.456
>> ELLA: I'm impressed.

26:30.456 --> 26:32.659
They have Ella.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.660
>> JENNY: Caitlyn.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.426
>> CAITLYN: Oh, here we go.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.327
>> ELLA: You're gonna love that.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.162
>> JENNY: "Someone who is held

26:36.162 --> 26:36.996
in high-esteem by her peers..."

26:36.996 --> 26:37.997
>> ELLA: Oh.

26:37.997 --> 26:38.998
>> CAITLYN: Like that.

26:38.998 --> 26:39.999
>> ELLA: Like that.

26:39.999 --> 26:40.900
>> JENNY: "...makes some

26:40.900 --> 26:41.901
mistakes and learns from them."

26:41.901 --> 26:42.902
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, well, that's

26:42.902 --> 26:43.903
true.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.271
>> JENNY: And finally, "Caitlyn

26:45.271 --> 26:47.239
encourages others."

26:47.239 --> 26:48.440
>> CAITLYN: I like that.

26:48.440 --> 26:49.541
Perfect name.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.744
(laughter)

26:51.744 --> 26:52.745
>> MAN: Ready to go flying and

26:52.745 --> 26:53.746
have some fun today?

26:53.746 --> 26:54.747
>> CHANDI: Oh, I'm thinking

26:54.747 --> 26:55.748
about it.

26:55.748 --> 26:56.582
>> MAN: 'Cause today, of course,

26:56.582 --> 26:57.583
we're gonna fly over the Grand

26:57.583 --> 26:58.584
Canyon.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.585
This is a site-seeing tour.

26:59.585 --> 27:00.586
It's not a thrill ride, so it is

27:00.586 --> 27:01.688
a very smooth, steady flight.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.689
>> KATE: Thank you.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.489
That's what I needed to hear.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.323
>> MAN: Mm-hmm. That's what you

27:04.323 --> 27:05.324
wanted to hear?

27:05.324 --> 27:07.293
>> KATE: Yeah.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.464
>> ELLA: Oh, my gosh.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.465
>> MAN: All right, are we

27:13.465 --> 27:14.701
finally ready to go?

27:14.701 --> 27:15.802
We are ready.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.103
Let's do this.

27:18.537 --> 27:21.173
(laughter, sighing, gasping)

27:21.173 --> 27:22.374
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.311
It's like a Disney ride!

27:25.311 --> 27:26.312
>> CAITLYN: Okay, guys, out in

27:26.312 --> 27:27.313
front of us is the big hole.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.247
>> MAN: Is everybody ready?

27:28.247 --> 27:29.248
>> CANDIS: I'm ready!

27:29.248 --> 27:30.249
>> CAITLYN: All right.

27:30.249 --> 27:31.150
>> MAN: That's good because it's

27:31.150 --> 27:32.151
happening.

27:32.151 --> 27:32.952
>> CAITLYN: It's happening!

27:32.952 --> 27:33.786
>> MAN: Welcome to the Grand

27:33.786 --> 27:34.620
Canyon, everybody.

27:34.620 --> 27:35.621
>> CAITLYN: Here we go.

27:35.621 --> 27:36.622
>> ALL: Whoa!

27:36.622 --> 27:37.623
>> CHANDI: Wow.

27:37.623 --> 27:38.725
>> ZACKARY: Oh, my gosh.

27:38.725 --> 27:39.625
>> CAITLYN: There it is-- the

27:39.625 --> 27:40.927
Grand Canyon.

27:40.927 --> 27:41.928
>> ZACKARY: Oh, my God.

27:41.928 --> 27:42.929
>> MAN: How is that view?

27:42.929 --> 27:44.463
>> CAITLYN: Not a bad view.

27:44.463 --> 27:45.464
>> CHANDI: Not a bad view at

27:45.464 --> 27:46.465
all.

27:46.465 --> 27:47.299
>> JENNY: The canyon takes your

27:47.299 --> 27:48.367
breath away.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.436
It makes you think about the

27:50.436 --> 27:52.504
meaning of our lives and how

27:52.504 --> 27:53.973
insignificant we are.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.742
It was very emotional up there.

27:55.742 --> 27:56.743
>> CANDIS: This is so gorgeous,

27:56.743 --> 27:58.778
you guys.

27:58.778 --> 28:01.547
* Oh, oh-oh

28:01.547 --> 28:04.751
Oh, oh. *

28:06.518 --> 28:09.488
(birds singing)

28:13.525 --> 28:14.961
>> CANDIS: So, you guys, I think

28:14.961 --> 28:16.062
our table's ready.

28:16.062 --> 28:17.063
>> CAITLYN: Let's go get

28:17.063 --> 28:18.164
something to eat.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.665
Am I at the head of the table?

28:19.665 --> 28:20.666
Scary.

28:20.666 --> 28:21.667
>> JENNY: You are at the head of

28:21.667 --> 28:22.668
the table.

28:22.668 --> 28:23.669
>> CANDIS: Hi, honey.

28:23.669 --> 28:24.670
You look gorge.

28:24.670 --> 28:25.671
(overlapping chatter)

28:25.671 --> 28:26.773
I love it.

28:26.773 --> 28:27.774
Yay!

28:27.774 --> 28:28.775
>> JENNY: The memo I got was

28:28.775 --> 28:29.776
casual dinner.

28:29.776 --> 28:31.010
Cait and I might be the only two

28:31.010 --> 28:32.011
who got the memo.

28:32.011 --> 28:33.012
(laughter)

28:33.012 --> 28:34.013
>> KATE: You are rocking

28:34.013 --> 28:35.014
Moschino.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.015
>> CAITLYN: I am rocking the

28:36.015 --> 28:37.016
Moschino tonight.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.017
>> KATE: Moschino.

28:38.017 --> 28:38.851
See, I don't even know how to

28:38.851 --> 28:39.852
pronounce this.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.686
>> COURTNEY: She's trying to

28:40.686 --> 28:41.520
look like a designer school

28:41.520 --> 28:42.521
teacher right now.

28:42.521 --> 28:43.522
>> CAITLYN: She's right.

28:43.522 --> 28:44.523
(laughter)

28:44.523 --> 28:45.524
>> KATE: If you were my school

28:45.524 --> 28:46.625
teacher, I would be so crushed

28:46.625 --> 28:47.794
out on you.

28:47.794 --> 28:48.795
(laughter)

28:48.795 --> 28:49.796
But you went to an all-boy

28:49.796 --> 28:50.797
school, too, right?

28:50.797 --> 28:51.798
>> CAITLYN: I did.

28:51.798 --> 28:52.799
>> KATE: Cross-dressing was

28:52.799 --> 28:53.800
really difficult until my senior

28:53.800 --> 28:54.801
year.

28:54.801 --> 28:55.802
I got my own room.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.803
I was a hall monitor.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.337
And then I could lock my door,

28:58.337 --> 28:59.338
and that's when I dressed up.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.339
>> CAITLYN: But you never went

29:00.339 --> 29:01.340
out?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.708
>> KATE: Oh, no.

29:02.708 --> 29:03.810
Stared at the door, wouldn't do

29:03.810 --> 29:04.811
it.

29:04.811 --> 29:05.812
That took a long time.

29:05.812 --> 29:06.813
>> JENNY: How long did it take?

29:06.813 --> 29:07.814
>> CAITLYN: You're telling me?

29:07.814 --> 29:08.815
(Kate chuckles)

29:08.815 --> 29:09.648
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, well, as time

29:09.648 --> 29:10.482
went on, I got more and more

29:10.482 --> 29:11.483
daring.

29:11.483 --> 29:12.418
I never used to get caught, and

29:12.418 --> 29:13.820
then, one day, when I was at the

29:13.820 --> 29:18.124
Marriott years ago in Orlando,

29:18.124 --> 29:19.058
went through the lobby, went

29:19.058 --> 29:20.026
down, got in the car, drove

29:20.026 --> 29:21.027
around for while, came back.

29:21.027 --> 29:22.028
>> COURTNEY: What, as Caitlyn?

29:22.028 --> 29:23.930
>> CAITLYN: Yes.

29:23.930 --> 29:24.931
Was walking through the lobby,

29:24.931 --> 29:25.932
and this guy comes running up

29:25.932 --> 29:26.933
behind me.

29:26.933 --> 29:28.067
"Hello! Hello! Hello!"

29:28.067 --> 29:29.468
And he goes, "Oh, I just love

29:29.468 --> 29:31.470
trans women."

29:31.470 --> 29:32.471
And I went, "(Bleep)!"

29:32.471 --> 29:34.473
I'm going, "Just keep walking."

29:34.473 --> 29:35.474
And he stayed out of the

29:35.474 --> 29:36.475
elevator.

29:36.475 --> 29:37.977
That was the closest I ever got

29:37.977 --> 29:38.978
to anybody ever.

29:38.978 --> 29:39.979
He goes, "I date 'em all the

29:39.979 --> 29:40.980
time.

29:40.980 --> 29:41.981
I love trans women."

29:41.981 --> 29:42.982
And this and that.

29:42.982 --> 29:43.983
>> CANDIS: He was chasing.

29:43.983 --> 29:44.851
>> CAITLYN: And I'm going,

29:44.851 --> 29:45.852
"Oh, (bleep), on the wrong guy."

29:45.852 --> 29:46.853
(laughter)

29:46.853 --> 29:47.854
Yeah. Scared me to death.

29:47.854 --> 29:48.855
Got into the room, locked the

29:48.855 --> 29:49.856
door.

29:49.856 --> 29:50.857
I didn't go out again.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.858
>> KATE: You know what's gonna

29:51.858 --> 29:53.692
have to happen for more

29:53.692 --> 29:56.195
acceptance is, this whole notion

29:56.195 --> 29:58.097
of chasers has got to get out of

29:58.097 --> 29:59.866
the field of being perverted.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.868
It's got to become as beautiful

30:01.868 --> 30:04.436
to love a trans person as it is

30:04.436 --> 30:06.005
to love a cis person.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.574
There's the natural leap.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.009
When our desirability is

30:10.009 --> 30:11.777
natural, you know?

30:11.777 --> 30:13.512
>> JENNY: But the men who-- and

30:13.512 --> 30:17.449
women-- but the men who love us

30:17.449 --> 30:19.085
need to be the ones to stand up

30:19.085 --> 30:20.086
and take responsibility and

30:20.086 --> 30:21.087
testify to that.

30:21.087 --> 30:22.088
>> KATE: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

30:22.088 --> 30:23.189
>> JENNY: Rather than it being

30:23.189 --> 30:27.693
some shameful thing, you know?

30:27.693 --> 30:28.895
>> CAITLYN: I can't even imagine

30:28.895 --> 30:30.462
some guy going out with me, and

30:30.462 --> 30:32.131
then being absolutely

30:32.131 --> 30:35.767
scrutinized by the tabloids.

30:35.767 --> 30:36.936
Can you imagine if I actually

30:36.936 --> 30:38.370
had a date and, like, walked out

30:38.370 --> 30:39.638
of a movie theatre on a quiet

30:39.638 --> 30:41.840
Wednesday night holding hands

30:41.840 --> 30:42.841
with somebody?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.210
I think they would be really

30:44.210 --> 30:45.611
tough on me, and certainly would

30:45.611 --> 30:46.712
be tough on the guy.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.847
Like, "Why are you dating her?"

30:48.847 --> 30:49.848
You know?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.750
"What are your motivation?"

30:51.750 --> 30:53.419
It just gets so complicated,

30:53.419 --> 30:55.121
because of the media, that I

30:55.121 --> 30:56.855
don't know any guy that would

30:56.855 --> 30:57.924
ever even want to go through

30:57.924 --> 31:00.893
something like that.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.231
>> JENNY: There is a faction of

31:05.231 --> 31:07.599
people who uses fear of trans

31:07.599 --> 31:08.834
people, fear of gay people to

31:08.834 --> 31:09.835
bring people to the polls, and

31:09.835 --> 31:10.836
it's...

31:10.836 --> 31:11.837
>> CAITLYN: We're not going

31:11.837 --> 31:12.838
there, and...

31:12.838 --> 31:13.839
>> JENNY: We are going there.

31:13.839 --> 31:15.341
That's why we're on this trip!

31:15.341 --> 31:16.808
>> CAITLYN: Oh, God.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.311
Every conservative guy out there

31:19.311 --> 31:22.281
believes in everybody's rights.

31:23.315 --> 31:24.416
>> WOMAN: Well, do you think...?

31:24.416 --> 31:25.417
Did you say... Whoa.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.519
>> CHANDI: Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

31:28.988 --> 31:29.989
>> ZACKARY: You know I have a

31:29.989 --> 31:30.990
great boyfriend...

31:30.990 --> 31:31.958
>> CHANDI: Oh, amaze balls.

31:31.958 --> 31:32.959
>> ZACKARY: ...who just worships

31:32.959 --> 31:33.960
me.

31:33.960 --> 31:34.961
>> CHANDI: She's got a good man.

31:34.961 --> 31:35.794
>> CANDIS: They all start out

31:35.794 --> 31:36.795
that way.

31:36.795 --> 31:37.796
(laughter and groaning)

31:37.796 --> 31:38.797
>> KATE: Well, well, well.

31:38.797 --> 31:39.798
(overlapping chatter)

31:39.798 --> 31:40.799
>> COURTNEY: Don't be a man

31:40.799 --> 31:41.800
hater.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.801
>> ZACKARY: Bitter party

31:42.801 --> 31:43.802
of three?

31:43.802 --> 31:44.803
(laughter)

31:44.803 --> 31:45.637
>> KATE: The world is changing,

31:45.637 --> 31:46.638
honey.

31:46.638 --> 31:47.739
There are more guys going, "Oh.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.076
Oh, okay."

31:50.076 --> 31:51.610
You know that.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.611
>> CANDIS: Yeah. No.

31:52.611 --> 31:53.879
I've never had a problem finding

31:53.879 --> 31:55.247
someone.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.248
It's finding the right person

31:56.248 --> 31:57.249
and, you know...

31:57.249 --> 31:58.250
>> CAITLYN: Oh, that's tough in

31:58.250 --> 31:59.251
any relationship.

31:59.251 --> 32:00.252
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.253
>> CHANDI: Right. Not only at

32:01.253 --> 32:02.321
night.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.355
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

32:03.355 --> 32:04.223
>> ZACKARY: And I think

32:04.223 --> 32:05.024
sometimes, like, well, we're

32:05.024 --> 32:06.025
really rare.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.026
We're not like all the other

32:07.026 --> 32:08.027
girls.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.028
>> CHANDI: Right.

32:09.028 --> 32:09.861
>> ZACKARY: There's only so many

32:09.861 --> 32:10.862
of us.

32:10.862 --> 32:11.863
>> CANDIS: Yeah. No.

32:11.863 --> 32:12.898
Yeah, no, for sure.

32:12.898 --> 32:13.799
>> CAITLYN: We just have to

32:13.799 --> 32:15.867
create understanding with them.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.403
We have to explain this issue in

32:17.403 --> 32:18.404
a way that they understand.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.405
>> COURTNEY: I...

32:19.405 --> 32:20.406
>> JENNY: And maybe we'll get

32:20.406 --> 32:21.407
there.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.408
Maybe we'll get there because we

32:22.408 --> 32:24.543
are being visible, and we're,

32:24.543 --> 32:27.513
um... and we're doing this work.

32:32.551 --> 32:33.552
(birds singing)

32:33.552 --> 32:34.720
(rooster crows)

32:34.720 --> 32:38.190
(crow caws)

32:38.190 --> 32:39.191
>> JENNY: What day is today?

32:39.191 --> 32:40.192
Thursday, isn't it?

32:40.192 --> 32:41.193
>> ZACKARY: No, it's Wednesday.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.194
>> JENNY: Today's Wednesday?

32:42.194 --> 32:43.195
>> ZACKARY: Yeah.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.164
>> JENNY: This is not what I

32:45.164 --> 32:46.165
need.

32:46.165 --> 32:47.166
Ugh.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.035
>> ZACKARY: What?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.736
>> JENNY: So, news broke that

32:50.736 --> 32:52.038
something really disturbing had

32:52.038 --> 32:53.472
happened in Houston.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.840
An act called "The Hero Act,"

32:54.840 --> 32:58.044
which guaranteed, um, equality,

32:58.044 --> 32:59.411
not just for LGBT people, but

32:59.411 --> 33:02.081
for all people, was, in fact,

33:02.081 --> 33:03.082
repealed.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.350
There was a campaign for the

33:04.350 --> 33:06.452
repeal that was run by a group

33:06.452 --> 33:09.055
of ministers and conservative

33:09.055 --> 33:10.056
Republicans.

33:10.056 --> 33:11.690
The tactic that was used against

33:11.690 --> 33:13.625
our community to have this

33:13.625 --> 33:16.262
quality act repealed was the

33:16.262 --> 33:18.197
threat that there would be sick

33:18.197 --> 33:21.067
men in dresses preying upon our

33:21.067 --> 33:23.469
children in restrooms.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.770
It scared people.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.338
Um, it was a lie, and it

33:26.338 --> 33:27.639
happened to work.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.209
While we were enjoying each

33:30.209 --> 33:31.343
others' company, something

33:31.343 --> 33:33.079
rather discouraging happened.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.480
Yesterday in Houston, an

33:34.480 --> 33:36.748
ordinance protecting LGBT people

33:36.748 --> 33:38.317
was repealed.

33:38.317 --> 33:41.787
The lead slogan was, "No men in

33:41.787 --> 33:44.290
women's bathrooms."

33:44.290 --> 33:45.291
>> CAITLYN: Well, I'm all for

33:45.291 --> 33:46.292
that, too.

33:46.292 --> 33:48.560
It's how you define men and

33:48.560 --> 33:49.561
women.

33:49.561 --> 33:50.562
>> CHANDI: Right.

33:50.562 --> 33:51.563
>> CAITLYN: That's all we're

33:51.563 --> 33:52.564
arguing over here.

33:52.564 --> 33:53.565
>> JENNY: Well, what the people

33:53.565 --> 33:55.601
behind this repeal managed to

33:55.601 --> 33:57.136
convince people was that people

33:57.136 --> 33:59.671
like you and you and you and you

33:59.671 --> 34:02.408
and you and me are men in the

34:02.408 --> 34:03.409
ladies room.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.410
>> CAITLYN: They just passed

34:04.410 --> 34:06.112
this ordinance in Santa Fe.

34:06.112 --> 34:07.446
It'd be very interesting to talk

34:07.446 --> 34:09.981
to the mayor-- who's all for

34:09.981 --> 34:12.017
this-- um, you know, some of the

34:12.017 --> 34:13.452
obstacles that he had to go

34:13.452 --> 34:14.453
through to get this through.

34:14.453 --> 34:15.454
>> JENNY: If I understand

34:15.454 --> 34:16.688
correctly, the thing in Santa Fe

34:16.688 --> 34:17.789
was the mayor just did it.

34:17.789 --> 34:18.924
Whereas in Houston, it was a

34:18.924 --> 34:20.226
popular referendum.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.227
>> CAITLYN: Right.

34:21.227 --> 34:22.728
>> JENNY: And, um, I think we're

34:22.728 --> 34:24.696
at a tipping point now where the

34:24.696 --> 34:26.698
religious right and some social

34:26.698 --> 34:28.434
conservatives are using fear of

34:28.434 --> 34:30.269
people like us, telling lies

34:30.269 --> 34:32.404
about people like us, to repeal

34:32.404 --> 34:34.940
and to prevent equality, and we

34:34.940 --> 34:35.941
have to push back on it.

34:35.941 --> 34:36.942
I mean, I'm just seeing this

34:36.942 --> 34:37.943
real division...

34:37.943 --> 34:38.944
>> CAITLYN: Yeah.

34:38.944 --> 34:39.778
>> JENNY: ...because there's all

34:39.778 --> 34:41.147
this support and love for you.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.148
You're being celebrated by

34:42.148 --> 34:43.715
Glamour magazine as one of the

34:43.715 --> 34:45.050
most influential women in the

34:45.050 --> 34:47.018
world.

34:47.018 --> 34:48.587
And meanwhile, voters are

34:48.587 --> 34:49.588
pushing back.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.490
>> CANDIS: And it takes one

34:51.490 --> 34:53.259
group saying that-that trans

34:53.259 --> 34:55.894
people are molesters, uh, to

34:55.894 --> 35:00.632
spook the rest of the community.

35:00.632 --> 35:02.534
I mean, I don't even think about

35:02.534 --> 35:03.535
ever not going into the ladies

35:03.535 --> 35:04.536
room.

35:04.536 --> 35:05.871
I've always been a strong

35:05.871 --> 35:07.038
believer that you just hold your

35:07.038 --> 35:08.039
head up high and live your life

35:08.039 --> 35:09.040
the way you're supposed to.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.041
>> ZACKARY: You hold your head

35:10.041 --> 35:11.177
up high and pee.

35:11.177 --> 35:12.178
>> CANDIS: Yeah.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.812
(laughter)

35:13.812 --> 35:15.347
>> JENNY: So, Caitlyn, I want to

35:15.347 --> 35:16.948
come back to you on this because

35:16.948 --> 35:18.784
it's worth asking you how you

35:18.784 --> 35:19.785
feel, as a conservative, about

35:19.785 --> 35:21.220
this.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.221
>> CAITLYN: I don't think it was

35:22.221 --> 35:23.922
presented well to the public.

35:23.922 --> 35:24.923
>> JENNY: But it was Republicans

35:24.923 --> 35:25.924
and conservatives who said--

35:25.924 --> 35:26.925
>> CAITLYN: Oh, please, it's

35:26.925 --> 35:27.926
not, don't go there.

35:27.926 --> 35:28.927
Just as much the Democrats.

35:28.927 --> 35:29.928
It was not, please, please,

35:29.928 --> 35:30.696
please, please.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.430
>> JENNY: Caity, no, Caity,

35:31.430 --> 35:32.198
it-it's true. Caity, why are

35:32.198 --> 35:33.199
you insisting that?

35:33.199 --> 35:34.200
>> CAITLYN: No, it's not!

35:34.200 --> 35:35.033
No, it's not.

35:35.033 --> 35:36.034
>> JENNY: It's not the truth?

35:36.034 --> 35:36.902
>> CAITLYN: Republicans and the

35:36.902 --> 35:37.903
conservatives are not these

35:37.903 --> 35:38.737
horrible people out there trying

35:38.737 --> 35:39.571
to oppress people.

35:39.571 --> 35:40.339
>> JENNY: I didn't say they

35:40.339 --> 35:41.072
were terrible people.

35:41.072 --> 35:42.073
In this particular, in this--

35:42.073 --> 35:43.309
>> CAITLYN: They're-they're not.

35:43.309 --> 35:44.376
>> JENNY: No, I know that.

35:44.376 --> 35:45.411
I-I come from a Republican

35:45.411 --> 35:46.578
family.

35:46.578 --> 35:47.579
>> CAITLYN: Sometimes these

35:47.579 --> 35:48.680
girls think now that I've

35:48.680 --> 35:49.681
transitioned that I, everything

35:49.681 --> 35:50.682
has to change.

35:50.682 --> 35:51.683
You can't be conservative

35:51.683 --> 35:52.684
anymore.

35:52.684 --> 35:53.985
You have to be a liberal.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.421
Um, no, I don't believe that.

35:55.421 --> 35:57.223
I think, uh, I can keep, um, all

35:57.223 --> 36:00.892
of my views the same, uh, 'cause

36:00.892 --> 36:02.594
I feel in my heart that that's

36:02.594 --> 36:03.829
the best way to go.

36:03.829 --> 36:04.930
I don't know anything of what

36:04.930 --> 36:06.232
they said down there, but I'm

36:06.232 --> 36:07.366
not blaming it on Republicans

36:07.366 --> 36:08.667
and conservatives, okay?

36:08.667 --> 36:09.668
>> JENNY: Well, I think you need

36:09.668 --> 36:10.669
to take a look at that.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.638
>> CAITLYN: Yeah. Oh, please.

36:14.473 --> 36:15.474
>> JENNY: No, you, please.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.475
>> CAITLYN: That's why you all

36:16.475 --> 36:17.476
need to go with me...

36:17.476 --> 36:18.477
>> JENNY: No, you-you, please!

36:18.477 --> 36:19.478
You need to look at it, Caity.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.479
>> CAITLYN: This is why you all

36:20.479 --> 36:21.480
need-- No.

36:21.480 --> 36:22.481
No, I'm not gonna identify that.

36:22.481 --> 36:23.715
We're not going there.

36:23.715 --> 36:24.950
>> JENNY: We are going there.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.151
That's why we're on this trip.

36:26.151 --> 36:28.287
>> CAITLYN: And-- Oh, God.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.262
>> JENNY: You're telling me

36:36.262 --> 36:37.263
Republicans support rights for

36:37.263 --> 36:38.264
transgender people? You're

36:38.264 --> 36:39.465
telling me that the people--

36:39.465 --> 36:40.432
>> CAITLYN: I think they believe

36:40.432 --> 36:41.367
in the Constitution and the

36:41.367 --> 36:42.501
freedom of the Constitution.

36:42.501 --> 36:43.569
>> JENNY: So who overturned--?

36:43.569 --> 36:44.803
>> CAITLYN: The-the public!

36:44.803 --> 36:46.004
Because they're uninformed!

36:46.004 --> 36:47.038
The politicians didn't even vote

36:47.038 --> 36:48.173
on it.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.541
They just put it on the ballot.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.709
>> KATE: Wait, there was an ad

36:50.709 --> 36:52.043
that was put forward by the

36:52.043 --> 36:53.612
former head of the Republican

36:53.612 --> 36:57.115
party in some county in Texas,

36:57.115 --> 37:00.018
and it's a horrible ad about a

37:00.018 --> 37:03.289
man who's standing outside the

37:03.289 --> 37:04.122
bathroom waiting for a little

37:04.122 --> 37:05.056
girl to go in.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.057
>> CAITLYN: Oh, yeah, I know,

37:06.057 --> 37:06.925
yeah, they, they use the fear

37:06.925 --> 37:07.926
factor big time.

37:07.926 --> 37:08.894
Now, he may have been

37:08.894 --> 37:09.895
Republican, I don't know, he

37:09.895 --> 37:10.696
might've been a Democrat.

37:10.696 --> 37:11.430
I don't know and so--

37:11.430 --> 37:12.163
>> JENNY: No, it was not a

37:12.163 --> 37:13.164
Democrat.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.334
"No men in women's bathrooms."

37:15.334 --> 37:16.335
>> CAITLYN: Yeah, I agree.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.336
It just so happens he happened

37:17.336 --> 37:18.337
to be a Republican.

37:18.337 --> 37:19.505
I wish he was a damn Democrat.

37:19.505 --> 37:20.506
That would've made my argument

37:20.506 --> 37:21.607
much easier.

37:21.607 --> 37:22.608
>> CHANDI: It would've made your

37:22.608 --> 37:23.609
argument a lot easier.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.610
>> CAITLYN: A lot easier.

37:24.610 --> 37:25.611
If the guy was a--

37:25.611 --> 37:26.612
>> CANDIS: Yeah, but there's

37:26.612 --> 37:27.613
never been a Democrat who's

37:27.613 --> 37:28.680
really stuck her neck out like

37:28.680 --> 37:29.915
that to take a stand against

37:29.915 --> 37:30.916
trans people.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.484
It might not be a coincidence.

37:32.484 --> 37:33.485
>> CAITLYN: This is not a

37:33.485 --> 37:34.720
Democrat or Republican issue.

37:34.720 --> 37:35.921
This is a humanity issue and

37:35.921 --> 37:37.122
it's been--

37:37.122 --> 37:38.123
>> JENNY: It is, but so far,

37:38.123 --> 37:39.325
it's been a Republican issue

37:39.325 --> 37:40.392
to-to turn people--

37:40.392 --> 37:41.460
>> CAITLYN: It has not.

37:41.460 --> 37:42.628
>> JENNY: We have 15 Republicans

37:42.628 --> 37:43.929
running for president, none of

37:43.929 --> 37:45.230
whom had stated publically that

37:45.230 --> 37:46.231
they're for trans rights and

37:46.231 --> 37:47.232
many whom have stated that they

37:47.232 --> 37:48.233
are against us.

37:48.233 --> 37:49.234
>> CAITLYN: They're just not

37:49.234 --> 37:50.235
talking about it.

37:50.235 --> 37:51.236
For the Republicans, it's not a

37:51.236 --> 37:53.339
big issue.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.906
The economy's the big issue.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.608
They're just worried about $18

37:56.608 --> 37:57.876
trillion of debt.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.611
Those are all those, much bigger

37:59.611 --> 38:00.946
issues.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.348
>> JENNY: There is a faction of

38:02.348 --> 38:03.982
people who uses fear of trans

38:03.982 --> 38:05.917
people, fear of gay people to

38:05.917 --> 38:07.719
bring people to the polls

38:07.719 --> 38:09.054
and-and it's generally--

38:09.054 --> 38:10.155
>> CAITLYN: But the Republicans,

38:10.155 --> 38:11.222
I don't feel like they're out to

38:11.222 --> 38:12.824
get us.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.394
>> JENNY: The Constitution.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.428
>> CAITLYN: Every conservative

38:16.428 --> 38:17.429
guy out there believes in

38:17.429 --> 38:18.430
everybody's rights.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.431
>> JENNY: That has never

38:19.431 --> 38:20.832
happened! That is a lie!

38:20.832 --> 38:23.201
That has never happened!

38:23.201 --> 38:24.736
>> CANDIS: I mean, it is

38:24.736 --> 38:26.805
frustrating to me that Cait

38:26.805 --> 38:30.376
doesn't see the obvious.

38:30.376 --> 38:33.044
I mean, it's not like we're

38:33.044 --> 38:35.747
saying, "No, the sky's pink.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.883
No, really the sky is pink."

38:37.883 --> 38:39.250
I don't know how to show her

38:39.250 --> 38:41.587
without demeaning her or making

38:41.587 --> 38:44.590
her feel less than, because her

38:44.590 --> 38:47.225
party that she represents

38:47.225 --> 38:49.194
doesn't believe in who we are as

38:49.194 --> 38:51.062
trans people.

38:51.062 --> 38:52.230
>> JENNY: You said you wanted to

38:52.230 --> 38:53.965
know what is, uh, your life as a

38:53.965 --> 38:55.401
woman gonna be like?

38:55.401 --> 38:56.902
What does it mean to be a woman

38:56.902 --> 38:58.504
besides hair and make-up?

38:58.504 --> 39:00.038
It means support for a woman's

39:00.038 --> 39:01.773
life.

39:01.773 --> 39:04.075
It means women's health care.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.210
>> CAITLYN: No, uh, the

39:05.210 --> 39:06.645
Republicans just look at it very

39:06.645 --> 39:07.813
much differently.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.880
They're just worried about much

39:08.880 --> 39:09.881
bigger issues than the trans

39:09.881 --> 39:12.684
issues.

39:12.684 --> 39:13.885
>> JENNY: The stakes are very

39:13.885 --> 39:14.920
high.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.055
If she doesn't listen to the

39:17.055 --> 39:18.524
rest of the community, I think

39:18.524 --> 39:19.825
she's gonna find herself

39:19.825 --> 39:21.527
isolated and irrelevant.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.629
As a leader, you need to embrace

39:23.629 --> 39:25.864
the fight for women's, for

39:25.864 --> 39:27.566
women's lives.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.435
>> CAITLYN: Yes, but we're 18

39:29.435 --> 39:31.169
and a half trillion dollars in

39:31.169 --> 39:32.237
debt-- our economy is going to

39:32.237 --> 39:34.706
collapse.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.775
(Candis sighs)

39:36.775 --> 39:37.843
The Democrats are destroying the

39:37.843 --> 39:38.877
country.

39:38.877 --> 39:39.878
They should be really careful.

39:39.878 --> 39:40.879
>> KATE: Oh, dear.

39:40.879 --> 39:42.848
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

39:47.686 --> 39:49.354
>> CAITLYN: Our economy is going

39:49.354 --> 39:51.457
to collapse.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.791
(Candis sighs)

39:52.791 --> 39:53.792
The Democrats are destroying the

39:53.792 --> 39:54.793
country.

39:54.793 --> 39:55.994
They should be really careful.

39:55.994 --> 39:56.995
>> KATE: Oh, dear.

39:56.995 --> 39:58.196
>> CAITLYN: Okay?

39:58.196 --> 39:59.264
>> ZACKARY: I really believe the

39:59.264 --> 40:00.265
feminist slogan "The personal is

40:00.265 --> 40:01.467
political."

40:01.467 --> 40:02.834
And the thing that's most

40:02.834 --> 40:04.135
important to me is advocating

40:04.135 --> 40:06.137
for my trans brothers and

40:06.137 --> 40:07.138
sisters.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.540
>> CHANDI: Mm-hmm.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.775
>> ZACKARY: And from what I've

40:09.775 --> 40:10.976
seen, the Democratic party has

40:10.976 --> 40:13.211
advocated for trans people in a

40:13.211 --> 40:14.245
way that the Republicans have

40:14.245 --> 40:15.313
not.

40:15.313 --> 40:16.648
>> CAITLYN: No!

40:16.648 --> 40:18.617
People look at the Democrats as

40:18.617 --> 40:21.219
they are this open-minded

40:21.219 --> 40:23.889
liberal group who's gonna sit

40:23.889 --> 40:25.624
around and help everybody.

40:25.624 --> 40:27.493
Free education, free health

40:27.493 --> 40:29.227
care, social programs, welfare,

40:29.227 --> 40:31.062
disability, insurance-- free

40:31.062 --> 40:32.263
this, free that.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.632
Well, right now, all those

40:33.632 --> 40:34.700
things are just killing our

40:34.700 --> 40:35.834
economy.

40:35.834 --> 40:36.935
I think what they don't realize

40:36.935 --> 40:38.103
is this country could collapse

40:38.103 --> 40:39.605
over this at some point.

40:39.605 --> 40:41.339
And if our country collapses, it

40:41.339 --> 40:42.808
doesn't make any difference if

40:42.808 --> 40:44.075
you're gay, trans-- whatever

40:44.075 --> 40:45.076
issue-- you're on social

40:45.076 --> 40:47.012
programs, it's over.

40:47.012 --> 40:48.379
>> JENNY: I do not want to argue

40:48.379 --> 40:50.516
about the government from here

40:50.516 --> 40:52.017
to San Francisco, okay?

40:52.017 --> 40:54.019
>> CANDIS: I just think that

40:54.019 --> 40:55.654
she's been living in this

40:55.654 --> 40:57.222
conservative bubble for so long

40:57.222 --> 40:58.557
that she doesn't really have any

40:58.557 --> 40:59.558
desire to...

40:59.558 --> 41:00.559
>> COURTNEY: To bring in any

41:00.559 --> 41:01.593
new information.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.661
>> CANDIS: ...to bring in any

41:02.661 --> 41:04.129
new information or ideas.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.531
When it comes to debating

41:05.531 --> 41:06.765
politics with Caitlyn, it's not

41:06.765 --> 41:08.567
a debate.

41:08.567 --> 41:11.436
She just talks what she believes

41:11.436 --> 41:13.271
in and she doesn't listen to the

41:13.271 --> 41:15.741
other side, which worries me.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.643
I'm at a loss.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.611
You know?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.118
>> WOMAN: Caitlyn Jenner, you

41:27.118 --> 41:28.353
don't speak for us!

41:28.353 --> 41:30.021
We didn't ask for your help!

41:30.021 --> 41:31.022
>> CAITLYN: I had no idea how

41:31.022 --> 41:32.357
difficult this trip would be.

41:32.357 --> 41:33.358
>> JENNY: "No one wants to see a

41:33.358 --> 41:34.626
man in a dress" sounds like you

41:34.626 --> 41:36.127
are putting down people who look

41:36.127 --> 41:37.395
that way.

41:37.395 --> 41:38.396
Did she tell you early on?

41:38.396 --> 41:39.397
>> KRIS: No.

41:39.397 --> 41:40.165
>> CAITLYN: Oh, I did, too.

41:40.165 --> 41:40.899
>> KRIS: I didn't know until

41:40.899 --> 41:41.900
all of this.

41:41.900 --> 41:42.901
>> CAITLYN: Wait, let me finish.

41:42.901 --> 41:43.902
>> KRIS: I couldn't have given

41:43.902 --> 41:44.903
you the definition of

41:44.903 --> 41:45.904
transgender.

41:45.904 --> 41:46.905
>> CAITLYN: Besides the hair and

41:46.905 --> 41:48.073
the make-up and the clothes,

41:48.073 --> 41:50.041
what does it mean to be a woman?

41:50.041 --> 41:51.209
(paparazzi clamoring)

41:51.209 --> 41:52.477
>> CANDIS: We're all married!

41:52.477 --> 41:54.445
>> CAITLYN: We're all married!

41:54.445 --> 41:55.847
>> KIM: Do you understand how

41:55.847 --> 41:58.750
important a DMV photo is?

41:58.750 --> 42:00.151
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah, baby.

42:00.151 --> 42:01.887
>> CAITLYN: The fun part for me

42:01.887 --> 42:03.889
is dragging all the girls along.

42:03.889 --> 42:05.356
To see them broaden their

42:05.356 --> 42:06.391
horizons and have some fun with

42:06.391 --> 42:08.594
this.

42:08.594 --> 42:09.861
>> CHANDI: Oh..

42:09.861 --> 42:11.162
Uh, uh...

42:11.162 --> 42:12.297
(laughs)

42:12.297 --> 42:13.932
Okay, okay.

42:13.932 --> 42:15.033
>> KYLIE: I wouldn't want to be

42:15.033 --> 42:16.301
on a red carpet with my vagina

42:16.301 --> 42:17.603
out.

42:17.603 --> 42:18.870
>> CAITLYN: Uh...

42:18.870 --> 42:20.371
>> KYLIE: My vagina.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.041
(crowd cheering)

42:23.041 --> 42:24.710
>> KRIS: You guys have all

42:24.710 --> 42:26.444
gotten a major ten from me.

42:26.444 --> 42:27.445
Not you, Jenner, just your

42:27.445 --> 42:28.446
friends.

42:28.446 --> 42:29.615
(laughter)

42:29.615 --> 42:31.116
>> CAITLYN: I agree, I agree.

42:31.116 --> 42:32.117
>> CANDIS: I could totally kiss

42:32.117 --> 42:33.118
you.

42:33.118 --> 42:34.119
>> MAN: I don't think I could

42:34.119 --> 42:35.120
really go there.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.121
>> CANDIS: 'Cause of the trans

42:36.121 --> 42:37.122
thing?

42:37.122 --> 42:38.123
>> MAN: It's a big issue, yes.

42:38.123 --> 42:39.758
Candis.

42:39.758 --> 42:40.826
>> CAITLYN: This is about life

42:40.826 --> 42:42.227
and who you are.

42:42.227 --> 42:45.664
It's almost like throwing old

42:45.664 --> 42:48.399
Bruce out the door.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.635
>> KATE: I know life is hard,

42:49.635 --> 42:50.969
but that's what happens.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.137
You build the world.

42:52.137 --> 42:53.438
It falls apart.

42:53.438 --> 42:54.439
>> WOMAN: Today is the

42:54.439 --> 42:55.707
Transgender Day of Remembrance

42:55.707 --> 42:56.808
that honors those lives we've

42:56.808 --> 42:57.943
lost in acts of anti-transgender

42:57.943 --> 42:59.410
violence.

42:59.410 --> 43:00.646
>> CHANDI: Sometimes I feel like

43:00.646 --> 43:03.148
I'm not there for her enough.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.016
>> MAN: I see my daughter

43:05.016 --> 43:06.184
blossom like a flower.

43:06.184 --> 43:07.185
Your father's blossoming for

43:07.185 --> 43:08.253
you.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.420
>> ELLA: I love you.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.856
>> MAN: I love you.

43:10.856 --> 43:13.024
>> CAITLYN: I need to evolve as

43:13.024 --> 43:15.226
a person and deal with my issues

43:15.226 --> 43:18.363
head on.

43:18.363 --> 43:21.432
There's just too much at stake

43:21.432 --> 43:23.268
to get it wrong.

43:23.268 --> 43:24.670
>> CANDIS: Oh, my God, I think

43:24.670 --> 43:26.738
that's Hillary.

43:26.738 --> 43:28.106
>> CAITLYN: Hillary, come and

43:28.106 --> 43:29.174
meet my family...

43:29.174 --> 43:30.241
>> HILLARY: Oh, my gosh!
