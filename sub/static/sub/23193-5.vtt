WEBVTT

00:09.410 --> 00:10.878
- LIFE--IT'S LITERALLY
ALL WE HAVE.

00:10.911 --> 00:12.246
BUT IS IT ANY GOOD?

00:12.280 --> 00:13.881
I'M A REVIEWER,
BUT I DON'T REVIEW

00:13.914 --> 00:15.916
FOOD, BOOKS, OR MOVIES.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.985
I REVIEW LIFE ITSELF.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.920
VIVA THE REVOLUTION!

00:19.953 --> 00:23.191
[crowd cheering]

00:23.224 --> 00:25.426
[Taser crackling]
AGH!

00:25.459 --> 00:28.429
[triumphant fanfare]

00:28.462 --> 00:33.033
*

00:33.067 --> 00:34.402
WELCOME TO REVIEW.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.836
I'M FORREST MACNEIL.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.738
AS USUAL, I WILL BE REVIEWING

00:37.771 --> 00:40.574
WHATEVER EXPERIENCES YOU SEND IN
THAT ARE, IN TURN,

00:40.608 --> 00:43.277
HANDED OFF TO ME
BY MISS A.J. GIBBS.

00:43.311 --> 00:44.945
- HI, FORREST.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.514
- WELL, A.J., WHAT'S MY FIRST
REVIEW FOR TODAY?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.748
- OKAY.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.117
THIS COMES FROM GLENDA

00:49.150 --> 00:51.285
WHO LIVES AT
THE GOLDEN IVY SENIOR HOME

00:51.319 --> 00:52.886
IN SALEM, OREGON.
- AHA.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.056
- WHAT'S IT LIKE TO HAVE
A BEST FRIEND?

00:56.090 --> 00:57.758
[chuckles]

00:57.791 --> 00:59.293
- OH, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.995
YEAH.
- WHO'S YOUR BEST FRIEND?

01:02.029 --> 01:03.597
- OH.

01:03.631 --> 01:06.434
HA.

01:06.467 --> 01:07.835
WHO IS MY BEST FRIEND?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.603
WELL...

01:09.637 --> 01:11.705
UH...

01:11.739 --> 01:16.277
WELL, ANYWAY, I'M OFF TO EXPLORE
HAVING A BEST FRIEND.

01:16.310 --> 01:19.980
THE TRUTH IS MY MARRIAGE KILLED
MY SOCIAL LIFE YEARS AGO.

01:20.013 --> 01:23.050
SUZANNE WAS ALL THE FRIEND
I'D EVER NEEDED.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.885
BUT AFTER
A CONTENTIOUS DIVORCE...

01:24.918 --> 01:26.987
- YOU ARE GONNA DIE ALONE!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:27.020 --> 01:28.789
- AND A BITTER,
ANGRY CUSTODY HEARING...

01:28.822 --> 01:31.292
- THERE ARE GRAVE CONCERNS
ABOUT MR. MACNEIL'S ABILITY

01:31.325 --> 01:32.293
TO BE A FIT PARENT.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.694
- THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

01:33.727 --> 01:36.864
SUZANNE WAS NOT RETURNING
MY CALLS.

01:36.897 --> 01:39.400
I NEEDED TO MAKE
A NEW BEST FRIEND.

01:39.433 --> 01:44.172
AND THEN I REALIZED THAT GENE,
MY EX-NEIGHBOR, MIGHT BE IDEAL.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.240
TRUE, HE AND I HAD
NEVER BEEN CLOSE

01:46.274 --> 01:48.509
AND MY RECENT REVIEW
OF BEING RACIST

01:48.542 --> 01:50.344
HAD ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE...

01:50.378 --> 01:54.915
LAUGH IT UP, YOU [bleep]!
[laughter]

01:54.948 --> 01:57.651
BUT I KNEW I COULD OVERCOME
ANY OBSTACLE.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.353
HEY, LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
- YEAH.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.821
- WHAT ARE YOU UP TO TONIGHT?

02:00.854 --> 02:02.656
- UM, NOTHING.
JUST WATCHING THE LAKERS.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.192
- THE LAKERS, HUH?

02:04.192 --> 02:06.394
OKAY, I'LL BE BACK TONIGHT.

02:06.427 --> 02:07.895
- WHAT?

02:07.928 --> 02:09.397
- HEY, THERE, STRANGER.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.598
WHAT, ARE YOU GOING FOR A JOG?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.832
- WHAT?
- ARE YOU GOING FOR A JOG?

02:11.865 --> 02:13.401
- YES.
- OH, GOOD. YEAH.

02:13.434 --> 02:16.204
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE TIME
FOR EXERCISE.

02:16.204 --> 02:18.672
THE CLOSER I GOT TO GENE,
THE CLOSER I WOULD GET

02:18.706 --> 02:22.210
TO RETURNING TO MY LIFE WITH MY
REAL BEST FRIEND, SUZANNE.

02:22.210 --> 02:23.844
YOU HAVE REACHED
FORREST MACNEIL.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.946
I WILL BE OUT OF THE OFFICE
UNTIL TOMORROW

02:25.979 --> 02:28.649
BECAUSE I AM GOING
TO MY BEST FRIEND'S HOUSE

02:28.682 --> 02:30.484
TO WATCH THE LAKERS GAME.

02:30.518 --> 02:32.353
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE
AFTER THE TONE,

02:32.386 --> 02:36.357
AND I WILL LISTEN TO IT AFTER
I AM DONE WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.125
- YOU'RE GOING
TO THE LAKERS GAME?

02:38.226 --> 02:39.760
- NO, I'M GOING OVER
TO GENE'S HOUSE

02:39.793 --> 02:40.828
TO WATCH IT THERE WITH HIM.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.230
- GENE?
- MM-HMM.

02:42.230 --> 02:45.233
- THE GUY YOU CALLED A [bleep]?

02:45.233 --> 02:46.800
- YES.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.469
- WELL, IF YOU GUYS
EVER NEED TICKETS, LET ME KNOW.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.770
I'LL HOOK YOU UP.

02:49.803 --> 02:52.540
- OH, REALLY?

02:52.573 --> 02:54.842
OKAY.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.610
WHEN I GOT TO GENE'S,
I DISCOVERED

02:56.644 --> 02:59.347
THAT SOME GUY NAMED CARLOS
HAD INVITED HIMSELF.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.714
- OOH.
- WHATEVER.

03:00.748 --> 03:02.283
- BOOM!
- OH, MAN.

03:02.316 --> 03:04.252
- THAT IS CALLED
THE PICK-AND-ROLL RIGHT THERE.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.719
- OH, DID I MISS
A PICK-AND-ROLL?

03:05.753 --> 03:07.421
[doorbell rings]
- OH, THAT'S THE PIZZA.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.723
- [whistles]

03:09.757 --> 03:11.892
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW GENE?
- I'VE KNOWN HIM FOREVER--

03:11.925 --> 03:14.027
GRADE SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL,
WE WERE IN THE ARMY TOGETHER.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.629
- OH, YEAH.
HE'S A GREAT GUY, HUH?

03:15.663 --> 03:17.265
- BEST FRIEND
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

03:17.265 --> 03:19.032
I LOVE HIM.
CHECK IT OUT.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.068
- OH, YEAH,
THERE YOU ARE.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.271
TWO BUDDIES
OUT FOR A WALK, HUH?

03:23.304 --> 03:25.606
WENT AND GOT THAT ONE FRAMED.
[both chuckle]

03:25.639 --> 03:27.875
- YOU GOT A BEST FRIEND?
- YEAH.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.278
PROBABLY, UH...

03:30.311 --> 03:33.381
PROBABLY GENE.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.148
PROBABLY MY BEST FRIEND TOO.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.285
- OH, OKAY.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.287
- THE MORE TIME
I SPENT WITH GENE,

03:39.320 --> 03:40.588
THE MORE OBVIOUS IT BECAME

03:40.621 --> 03:42.656
THAT CARLOS
WAS A SERIOUS OBSTACLE

03:42.690 --> 03:43.957
TO OUR BEST FRIENDSHIP.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.426
[cell phone vibrates]

03:45.459 --> 03:46.894
- GUYS, THIS IS ALICIA
FOR THE FOURTH TIME.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.296
AND I CANNOT IGNORE IT.

03:48.296 --> 03:51.932
- TAKE THAT CALL, MY FRIEND.
[chuckles]

03:51.965 --> 03:55.669
HEY, CARLOS...
I THINK YOU ARE A GREAT GUY.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.771
I'VE HAD A LOT OF FUN
HANGING OUT WITH YOU

03:57.805 --> 03:59.473
IN THESE PAST FEW DAYS,
BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU--

03:59.507 --> 04:03.744
GENE IS MY BEST FRIEND
THAT I MADE, YOU KNOW?

04:03.777 --> 04:05.546
HE'S NOT JUST SOME GUY
THAT I HAVE A BUNCH

04:05.579 --> 04:08.749
OF SHARED EXPERIENCES WITH.

04:08.782 --> 04:12.486
I GUESS I'M SAYING YOU MIGHT
WANT TO GET OUT OF THE WAY.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.855
TO CARLOS,
THE IDEA THAT I COULD EVER BE

04:14.888 --> 04:16.924
GENE'S BEST FRIEND
WAS ABSURD,

04:16.957 --> 04:20.060
AND HE PROPOSED AN INTERESTING,
IF UNORTHODOX, WAY

04:20.093 --> 04:21.429
TO SETTLE THE ISSUE.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.331
- YOU KNOW, BACK IN BASIC,
WE HAD A SAYING.

04:23.364 --> 04:26.500
"DON'T TALK THE TALK
IF YOU CAN'T WALK THE WALK."

04:26.534 --> 04:28.769
- MEANING?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.672
- I'M CHALLENGING YOU
TO A FRIEND-OFF.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.240
- WHAT IS THAT?

04:33.341 --> 04:35.008
- WE WILL TRY TO OUT-FRIEND
EACH OTHER WITH GENE

04:35.042 --> 04:38.446
UNTIL ONE GUY CAN'T FRIEND
ANYMORE, AND THEN HE GOES,

04:38.479 --> 04:41.014
FOR GOOD.
- OKAY.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.215
YOU'RE ON.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.851
I CAN OUT-FRIEND YOU ANY DAY.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.085
- HEY, GUYS, CAN YOU REMIND ME

04:45.118 --> 04:46.854
TO GET TOILET PAPER
ON THE WAY HOME?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.255
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

04:48.356 --> 04:49.857
IN FACT, I WILL SET
AN ALARM ON MY PHONE

04:49.890 --> 04:52.092
TO REMIND ME TO REMIND YOU
TO GET TOILET PAPER.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.629
- I'LL GET YOU ENOUGH
TOILET PAPER TO LAST 100 YEARS.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.097
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA KEEP

04:57.130 --> 04:58.799
ALL THAT TOILET PAPER.

04:58.832 --> 05:02.436
SO I POURED IT ON, FRIENDING
AS HARD AS I COULD FRIEND.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.538
HEY, GUYS!
[chuckles]

05:04.572 --> 05:06.106
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY FRIEND.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.141
- OH, MY BIRTHDAY
WAS TWO MONTHS AGO, FORREST.

05:08.175 --> 05:09.443
- HOP ON, MY FRIEND.
- OH, MY--

05:09.477 --> 05:11.645
THIS IS BEAUTIFUL, FORREST.
- IT IS.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.447
YOU KNOW, THIS IS WHAT
BEST FRIENDS DO.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.982
- YEAH.
- THAT'S REALLY NICE,

05:15.015 --> 05:16.784
BUT YOU GOT TO BE CAREFUL
WITH THESE THINGS.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.386
I MEAN, I'VE BEEN
READING ABOUT 'EM,

05:18.419 --> 05:20.120
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
RUNNING OVER THEIR KIDS.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.655
- YEAH, WELL--
- KID LOST PART OF HIS FACE.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.223
- I-I'VE BEEN READING
ABOUT 'EM TOO.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.725
THEY SAID IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.694
WHAT THEY'RE DOING
WITH FACES THESE DAYS--

05:26.727 --> 05:28.562
THEY TAKE SOMEBODY'S FACE, AND
THEY PUT IT ON SOMEBODY ELSE,

05:28.596 --> 05:30.030
SO THEY GET
THIS FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.465
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.466
- RIGHT.
- I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA

05:32.500 --> 05:33.734
RUN OVER CLAYTON'S FACE

05:33.767 --> 05:35.803
OR HE'S GONNA LOSE
ANY OF HIS FACE.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.471
BUT I'M SAYING IF IT DID HAPPEN,
THEY'VE GOT THE SCIENCE NOW--

05:37.505 --> 05:39.139
BUT CARLOS PROVED
TO BE A WORTHY ADVERSARY.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.741
THE BEST PLACE IN TOWN.
- OH, MY GOD.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.009
WHAT IS THAT
IN THE BACKYARD?

05:42.042 --> 05:44.412
- OH, YOU'RE HERE.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.414
- WHAT IS THAT?
- WAIT A SECOND.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.416
ISN'T THAT THE NEW GRILL
THAT I JUST GOT YOU

05:48.416 --> 05:49.883
THAT YOU SHOULD BE MAKING
BURGERS ON RIGHT NOW?

05:49.917 --> 05:53.921
COME ON.
- CARLOS! YOU ARE AWESOME!

05:55.523 --> 05:56.890
- BURGERS?
- DON'T TOUCH IT!

05:56.924 --> 05:58.225
I WANT TO TOUCH IT.
I WANT TO TOUCH IT.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.560
HEY, MAN,
THIS THING'S AWESOME.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.061
- WELL, IT'S STAINLESS STEEL.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.896
IT'S GONNA LAST 100 YEARS.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.098
- THAT'S A LONG TIME
TO EAT FLAVORLESS MEAT.

06:05.132 --> 06:09.570
YOU KNOW, CHARCOAL GRILLS HAVE
MORE OF A SMOKY TASTE, I FIND.

06:09.603 --> 06:11.739
- OH, HEY, SUZANNE.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.940
- SUZANNE.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.675
HEY, COME JOIN US FOR A BURGER.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.909
- NO, THANK YOU.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.178
- OH. YOU GOT PLANS?
- NOPE.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.014
- SO FAR, SPENDING TIME
WITH GENE HADN'T DONE ANYTHING

06:21.048 --> 06:23.116
TO IMPROVE MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH SUZANNE.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.053
SHE'S ALWAYS GOT
SOMETHING GOING ON.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.289
THANKS, GENE.

06:29.322 --> 06:31.058
BUT I WAS NOT ABOUT TO GIVE UP.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.797
- THE COMPETITION FOR GENE'S
FRIENDSHIP WAS FIERCE,

06:36.830 --> 06:38.866
BUT I WAS ABOUT TO DRIVE
THE BASKETBALL

06:38.899 --> 06:40.167
STRAIGHT INTO THE HOLE.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.802
OH, ROW TWO!

06:41.835 --> 06:43.103
OH, THESE ARE GREAT.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.038
THANK YOU.
WOW.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.874
GREAT.
ALL RIGHT.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.609
GET OUT OF HERE.
[chuckles]

06:48.642 --> 06:51.311
HEY, LISTEN, GENE,
DO YOU HAVE PLANS FOR TONIGHT

06:51.344 --> 06:52.846
IS THE QUESTION.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.382
OKAY, WELL, DO YOU THINK
YOU COULD TELL CARLOS

06:55.483 --> 06:59.787
THAT YOU NEED TO "RESKEJ"
BECAUSE YOU HAVE COURTSIDE

06:59.820 --> 07:03.957
LAKERS TICKETS
TO THE LAKERS GAME TONIGHT!

07:03.991 --> 07:06.494
IN THE SAME SECTION AS
JACK NICKELMAN FROM THE SHINING.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.128
WE'LL BE RIGHT NEAR HIM.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.963
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
WELL, I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 6:00.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.232
HOW ABOUT THAT?
ALL RIGHT, BEST FRIEND.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.300
SEE YOU SOON.
BYE.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.135
[chuckles]

07:17.170 --> 07:20.574
I'M ABOUT TO WIN A FRIEND-OFF.
[clicks tongue]

07:20.608 --> 07:22.543
- DUDE.
- [laughs]

07:22.576 --> 07:24.978
CHECK THESE OUT.
- THIS IS AMAZING.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.614
DOWN IN A SEC.
CAN'T GO TO THE GAME

07:26.647 --> 07:28.381
WITHOUT MY LUCKY KOBE JERSEY.
- NO, YOU CAN'T.

07:28.415 --> 07:32.319
GO PUT THAT ON, PLEASE.
[chuckles]

07:32.352 --> 07:35.088
OH, CARLOS.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.658
BUDDY, I TRIED SO HARD
TO GET THREE TICKETS.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.759
I JUST COULDN'T SWING IT.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.427
- NO, NO.
I UNDERSTAND.

07:40.528 --> 07:41.995
- YEAH.
WELL, YOU'LL PROBABLY HAVE FUN

07:42.029 --> 07:43.797
WATCHING THE GAME
ALL BY YOURSELF ON TV, RIGHT?

07:43.831 --> 07:45.533
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU'LL EVEN SEE
ME AND GENE WAVING AT YOU.

07:45.533 --> 07:47.901
"HEY, CARLOS."
[chuckles]

07:47.935 --> 07:49.670
- NO, I'M GONNA MISS IT.
I GOT A DATE.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.238
- OH, WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.240
- YEAH, IT'S
WITH YOUR EX-WIFE, SUZANNE.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.008
- EXCUSE ME?

07:55.042 --> 07:58.546
- WHEN I FOUND OUT GENE WAS BUSY
TONIGHT, I HAD TO MAKE PLANS.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.548
I'M REALLY EXCITED
ABOUT IT TOO.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.550
I'M GONNA TAKE HER
TO THIS ROMANTIC LITTLE SPOT

08:02.583 --> 08:04.251
WHERE I KNOW THE CHEF.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.687
WE'LL PROBABLY GET PRETTY DRUNK.
- YEAH.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.388
- AND THEN I'M GONNA [bleep]
THE [bleep] OUT OF HER.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.823
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.892
YOU CAN HAVE GENE.

08:11.925 --> 08:14.895
GO TO THE BASKETBALL GAME.
JUST STAY AWAY FROM SUZANNE.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.231
WHILE I HAD LOST THE BATTLE
FOR GENE'S BEST FRIENDSHIP,

08:18.265 --> 08:20.868
I HAD GAINED SOMETHING
EVEN MORE MEANINGFUL--

08:20.901 --> 08:24.271
AN EXCUSE TO PAY
A VISIT TO SUZANNE.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.207
PERHAPS HER GRATITUDE
AT BEING PROTECTED FROM CARLOS

08:27.240 --> 08:29.910
WOULD OPEN THE DOOR
TO A NEW FUTURE FOR US.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.411
HI.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.346
- FORREST, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:33.380 --> 08:35.048
- WELL, I HAPPEN TO KNOW

08:35.082 --> 08:37.417
THAT YOU WERE CANCELED ON
FOR THE EVENING.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.252
- OH, REALLY?
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

08:39.286 --> 08:43.456
- WELL, I DON'T LIKE TO TELL YOU
THIS, BUT CARLOS, YOUR DATE,

08:43.490 --> 08:46.426
WAS ACTUALLY ONLY JUST USING YOU
TO GET BACK AT ME.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.395
- WHY WOULD HE DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

08:48.428 --> 08:50.063
- BECAUSE I WAS WINNING
A FRIEND-OFF...

08:50.097 --> 08:51.198
- MM.
- AND SO...

08:51.231 --> 08:52.265
- ALL RIGHT.
ANYTHING ELSE?

08:52.299 --> 08:53.601
- I DON'T NEED A THANK-YOU

08:53.634 --> 08:55.068
FOR--FOR DOING IT,
BUT I DID THINK...

08:55.102 --> 08:56.937
- YEAH?
- SINCE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS

08:56.970 --> 08:59.472
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS,
WE CAN--

08:59.506 --> 09:01.441
- WHAT?
- I GOT THAT GUY OFF YOUR--

09:01.474 --> 09:03.276
OFF YOUR BACK.
- YEAH.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.511
WE GOT A NIGHT TO OURSELVES.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.314
ALL RIGHT.
- NO, BUT I THOUGHT--

09:13.153 --> 09:16.857
[knock at door]

09:16.890 --> 09:18.325
SORRY.
- WHAT?

09:18.358 --> 09:19.526
- WHEN YOU SAID
"WE GOT A NIGHT TO OURSELVES"

09:19.627 --> 09:20.994
DO YOU MEAN YOU
AND I ARE GONNA--

09:21.028 --> 09:22.896
- NO. ALONE.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.531
- I JUST DIDN'T GET TO FINISH.
I WAS GONNA ASK IF YOU WANTED

09:24.632 --> 09:26.233
TO GO AND GET DINNER.
- NO, I GOT THAT.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.801
- ALL RIGHT. I DIDN'T KNOW--
- MY CLOSING THE DOOR

09:27.835 --> 09:29.369
MEANT I DIDN'T WANT TO DO IT.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.971
- I JUST HADN'T SAID IT,
AND I DIDN'T KNOW.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.974
- OKAY.
PLEASE. PLEASE.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.644
- OKAY.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.179
FOR ALL THE POSITIVE ASPECTS
OF HAVING A BEST FRIEND,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.181
HAVING A BEST FRIEND
CAN ALSO LEAVE YOU

09:41.214 --> 09:43.183
EMOTIONALLY VULNERABLE--

09:43.216 --> 09:45.385
A QUESTIONABLE PROPOSITION
AT BEST.

09:45.418 --> 09:50.190
HAVING A BEST FRIEND--
2 1/2 STARS.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.060
- OUR NEXT REQUEST COMES
TO US VIA TWITTER

09:53.093 --> 09:55.262
FROM @EXTRACHEESEPLEASE.

09:55.295 --> 09:59.066
HE SAYS, "HEY, FORREST, EARTH
IS BUMMING ME OUT THESE DAYS.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.101
WHAT'S IT LIKE
TO GO TO OUTER SPACE?"

10:01.134 --> 10:02.670
- WAIT A MINUTE.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.371
REALLY?
NO.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.439
GOING TO OUTER SPACE,
FOR REAL?

10:06.473 --> 10:08.441
THE ACTUAL--
I MEAN, THE REAL OUTER SPACE

10:08.475 --> 10:10.010
ON, LIKE, A ROCKET SHIP?

10:10.043 --> 10:12.412
[laughing wildly]

10:12.445 --> 10:14.614
WOW!
- OH-HO-HO.

10:14.648 --> 10:16.116
- I MEAN, I'M MORE EXCITED
ABOUT THAT

10:16.149 --> 10:17.584
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
WE'VE GOTTEN SO FAR.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.352
- YOU'RE GONNA
LOVE IT UP THERE.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.054
YOU SHOULD JUST STAY
UP THERE FOREVER.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.691
- [laughing]
I AM GONNA LOVE IT UP THERE.

10:23.724 --> 10:25.425
YEAH, I REALLY AM,
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.027
I THINK BEING UP IN SPACE
IS GONNA GIVE ME

10:27.060 --> 10:29.229
A GREAT SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE,
YOU KNOW?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.798
OH, MY GOODNESS.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.900
SPACEWARD HO!

10:32.933 --> 10:35.535
[laughing wildly]

10:35.568 --> 10:36.770
HERE WE GO.

10:36.804 --> 10:41.108
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,

10:41.141 --> 10:45.312
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO...

10:45.345 --> 10:48.248
- I'M GOING TO SPACE.
- BYE-BYE!

10:48.281 --> 10:52.619
- TO DATE, ONLY 525 PEOPLE HAVE
LEFT THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.990
THAT'S LESS THAN 1%
OF ALL PEOPLE WHO'VE EVER LIVED.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.727
I'M LUCKY TO BE JOINING
THAT NUMBER, AND SO ARE YOU,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.529
BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER PEOPLE WHO
HAVE HOARDED THEIR EXPERIENCE

11:02.562 --> 11:06.867
OF GOING INTO SPACE,
I'M GOING TO BE SHARING MINE.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.902
I PAID A VISIT TO 2SPACE--

11:08.936 --> 11:12.139
A PIONEER IN THE BRAVE NEW WORLD
OF SPACE TOURISM.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.342
MY SALESMAN MADE IT SOUND
LIKE A TRIP TO SPACE WAS EASIER

11:15.375 --> 11:17.044
THAN A TRIP TO MEXICO--

11:17.077 --> 11:20.247
NO PASSPORT AND VERY LITTLE
CHANCE OF BEING KIDNAPPED.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.648
ALSO, I HAPPENED TO ARRIVE

11:21.749 --> 11:24.184
ON THE LAST DAY
OF A SPECIAL PROMOTION.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.755
FOR AN EXTRA $100,000,
I COULD BRING A COMPANION.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.823
HMM.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.592
[indistinct chatter]
- WHERE'S MOM? WHERE'S MOM?

11:32.625 --> 11:34.895
- WELL, MOM WAS SAYING DON'T--
- HELLO, EVERYONE, HELLO.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.396
- WELL, HI, FORREST.

11:36.429 --> 11:39.099
EVERYONE, THIS IS FORREST,
MY EX-SON-IN-LAW.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.168
NICE TO SEE YOU. WE'RE JUST
HAVING A LITTLE PARTY.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.070
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
AND I KNOW THAT

11:43.103 --> 11:44.838
I WASN'T INVITED TO THE PARTY.
- NO, YOU WERE NOT.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.940
- I'M NOT GONNA STAY LONG,
BUT 75 IS A BIG ONE, JACK.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.541
SO I WANTED TO BRING YOU
A PRESENT.

11:48.575 --> 11:49.910
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.678
SORRY YOU CAN'T STAY
ANY LONGER.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.080
- I'M SORRY--
ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.115
CAN--CAN YOU OPEN IT NOW?
- WELL, UH...

11:55.148 --> 11:57.384
- WE WERE JUST IN THE MIDDLE--
- WE WERE JUST IN--UH, OKAY.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.219
- WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

11:59.252 --> 12:01.188
- OH, DEAR, IT'S A JUMPSUIT,
JUST LIKE YOURS.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.522
I HOPE IT FITS.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.191
IF NOT, I KNOW
WHO I CAN GIVE THIS TO.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.159
- [laughs]
- THANKS SO MUCH.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.360
- YEAH, BUT THAT'S NOT
ALL THERE IS.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.129
ACTUALLY, IF YOU OPEN THE CARD,

12:09.162 --> 12:10.663
THAT'S--'CAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING IN THERE.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.532
- YOU KNOW,
THIS IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.267
I WISH YOU HADN'T DONE THIS.
- WELL, IT'S MY PLEASURE.

12:14.301 --> 12:17.304
- YEAH, SO DO I.
- 75.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.540
THAT IS A TICKET
TO GO INTO SPACE.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.042
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.643
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- WHAT?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.813
- YEAH, IT'S COMMERCIAL
SPACE TOURISM.

12:25.813 --> 12:27.014
IT'S A NEW THING.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.548
YOU AND I ARE GOING
TO SPACE, JACK.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.117
- DO YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
MY LIFELONG DREAM?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.318
- I DO KNOW THAT, JACK.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.620
- I'M GOING INTO SPACE!
- WHAT?

12:33.653 --> 12:35.022
- YOU AND I TOGETHER.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.124
- I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
FOR JUST ONE SECOND.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.559
- JUST ONE SECOND.
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

12:39.592 --> 12:41.028
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- YOU'RE SENDING MY FATHER

12:41.061 --> 12:43.230
INTO SPACE?
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOUR BRAIN?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.899
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?
- HE'S 75 YEARS OLD!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.901
- I HAD NO IDEA
THAT I HAD TO CONSULT WITH YOU

12:47.935 --> 12:49.402
ABOUT PRESENTS
FOR YOUR PARENTS.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.038
- WE ARE NO LONGER MARRIED.

12:51.071 --> 12:53.040
YOU NEVER GAVE HIM A PRESENT
WHEN WE WERE MARRIED.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.507
- BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS
TOOK CARE OF THAT.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.176
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU ANGRY ABOUT?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.710
- I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.346
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.
- I'M GIVING HIM--

12:59.379 --> 13:01.148
- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO IMPRESS ME.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.150
- THAT IS SO NARCISSISTIC OF YOU
TO SUGGEST THAT.

13:03.183 --> 13:04.417
- [scoffs]

13:04.451 --> 13:06.219
- LOOK AT--
LOOK AT HOW HAPPY HE IS.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.855
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN HIM THAT HAPPY?

13:07.855 --> 13:10.390
AND YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT YOU?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.992
- FORREST,
THIS IS THE NICEST THING

13:12.025 --> 13:14.594
ANYONE HAS EVER DONE
FOR ME IN 75 YEARS.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.229
- I GAVE YOU TWO CHILDREN.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.564
- [laughs]

13:17.597 --> 13:19.632
- YOU ARE GREAT.
- YOU ARE GREAT.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.468
WE'RE GONNA HAVE FUN.
- ALL RIGHT, HUGS ARE OVER.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.003
- OH.
- OKAY.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.938
- DRIVE CAREFULLY.
THOSE FREEWAYS CAN BE DANGEROUS.

13:24.972 --> 13:25.939
- YEAH.
- I KNOW.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.307
[laughter]
ALL RIGHT.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.641
GREAT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.410
- I KNOW.
IT'S WONDERFUL, DAD.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.879
- WHERE'S ERIC? I'LL SEE YOU
NEXT WEEKEND, BUDDY.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.146
ALL RIGHT, BYE-BYE.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.447
- YEAH, I KNOW.
IT'S A WONDERFUL THING.

13:41.088 --> 13:43.523
- THE BEAUTY OF SPACE
IS THAT IT'S PURE.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.692
IT'S A CONCEPT, A PROMISE,

13:45.725 --> 13:47.895
A FRESH VIEW ONTO EARTH.

13:47.895 --> 13:51.364
I BELIEVED THAT IN SPACE I COULD
ESCAPE THE PETTY SUSPICIONS

13:51.398 --> 13:55.202
AND UNFAIR JUDGMENTS I WAS
CONSTANTLY SUBJECTED TO HERE.

13:55.235 --> 13:58.171
BUT MY EAGERNESS TO GET
INTO THE DARK VACUUM OF SPACE

13:58.205 --> 14:00.207
WAS NOTHING COMPARED TO JACK'S.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.776
- REMEMBER THERE WAS
GUS GRISSOM, ALAN SHEPARD,

14:03.810 --> 14:08.148
CHUCK ALDRIN, GLENN ARMSTRONG,
AND THEN, OF COURSE,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.816
THERE WAS BUZZ ARMSTRONG.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.418
- YEAH--NO.
- NO, NO, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.320
- WAS IT NEIL ARMSTRONG?
- NEILS ARMSTRONG IS RIGHT.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.587
- OKAY.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.023
- AND I REMEMBER
WHEN THOSE RUSSIANS

14:16.056 --> 14:18.325
GOT THAT SLUTPRICK
UP THERE BEFORE WE DID.

14:18.358 --> 14:22.095
- OH.
- THOSE WERE DARK TIMES.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.696
- YEAH.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.098
- THIS IS WONDERFUL.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.100
WHEN WE ARRIVED,
WE MET OUR SPACE FAMILY--

14:27.134 --> 14:28.969
THE THREE OTHER HUMANS
WHO WOULD JOIN US

14:29.002 --> 14:30.603
ON OUR HEAVENLY JOURNEY.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.940
THERE WAS BRYCE FROOD,
WHO TOLD ME SECRETLY

14:32.940 --> 14:35.108
HE PLANNED TO PROPOSE
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND, CARRIE,

14:35.142 --> 14:37.177
AT 300,00 FEET,

14:37.210 --> 14:40.180
AND THE SINGER AND CERTIFIED
COSMONAUT LANCE BASS,

14:40.213 --> 14:41.848
WHO HAD RAISED FUNDS
FOR HIS TRIP

14:41.949 --> 14:43.483
THROUGH AN AMBITIOUS
SPONSORSHIP PLAN.

14:43.516 --> 14:44.952
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE.
- RIGHT?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.186
- WERE WE ALL SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

14:46.219 --> 14:47.955
- I WISH I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT.
- YEAH.

14:47.988 --> 14:50.523
- WE'RE GONNA BE LEAVING
THIS PLACE, EARTH.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.360
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR THESE PLANETOIDS

14:53.393 --> 14:55.028
OR ANY PLANETOIDS,
FOR THAT MATTER.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.165
WE'RE GONNA BE STAYING
RIGHT IN HERE.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.801
- WHAT WILL WE
BE LOOKING DOWN ON?

15:01.834 --> 15:05.105
OVER ONE THRILLING WEEK,
THE FIVE OF US

15:05.138 --> 15:09.142
COMPLETED AN EXHAUSTIVE SERIES
OF PREPARATIONS.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.811
- FLOCK OF SEAGULLS.

15:11.844 --> 15:14.114
- WE SIGNED OUR LIFE AWAY
ON NUMEROUS FORMS.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.815
- EVERYBODY GETS ONE.

15:15.848 --> 15:19.819
- WE LEARNED
SPECIAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS.

15:19.852 --> 15:24.624
- ONE, TWO, THREE.
VERY GOOD.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.094
- YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY
WE'RE GONNA LIVE IN OUTER SPACE

15:27.127 --> 15:29.062
AND LIVE ON PLANETS.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.664
I WON'T BE AROUND TO SEE THAT,
AND I DON'T THINK I WANT TO,

15:31.698 --> 15:33.766
BUT JUST TO READ ABOUT IT
IS SO EXCITING.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.468
- NOW HIT
THAT THREE-POINT SAFETY CHECK.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.736
- WHAT?
- THE THREE-POINT--

15:36.769 --> 15:38.471
- YES, THEY ARE
ONE, TWO, THREE,

15:38.505 --> 15:39.672
AND OUT YOUR GO.
- OKAY.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.775
GREAT. YEAH.
- GOOD JOB.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.813
- THEN WE SPENT A DAY JUMPING
ON TRAMPOLINES

15:46.846 --> 15:49.849
TO PREPARE OUR BODIES AND MINDS
FOR ZERO GRAVITY.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.918
- AND STRATOJUMP.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.686
GOOD.
TOUCH YOUR TOES, SIR.

15:53.720 --> 15:56.489
- IT WAS THE FINAL STAGE
OF PREPARATION WE NEEDED

15:56.523 --> 15:59.292
FOR THE RIGORS OF SPACE TRAVEL.

16:03.830 --> 16:06.866
- IN NO TIME, THE DAY WAS HERE.

16:06.899 --> 16:09.069
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
IT'S REALLY HAPPENING.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.938
- UP YOURS, SLUTPRICK.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.641
- IN RETROSPECT, I POSSIBLY
SHOULD HAVE USED MY EXTRA TICKET

16:14.674 --> 16:16.109
TO BRING A CAMERAMAN ALONG.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.211
AS IT WAS, WE HAD
TO RELY ON THE VIDEO

16:18.245 --> 16:20.647
SPECIALLY PRODUCED BY 2SPACE.

16:23.916 --> 16:25.152
- WELCOME TO 2SPACE.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.753
- IT WAS EXCITING FOR ME,

16:26.786 --> 16:29.889
BUT FOR JACK, WELL,
HE HAD SPENT HIS WHOLE LIFE

16:29.922 --> 16:31.324
DREAMING OF THIS MOMENT,

16:31.358 --> 16:34.327
NEVER REALLY BELIEVING
IT WAS WITHIN REACH.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.763
LIFE IS TRULY FULL OF SURPRISES.

16:36.796 --> 16:37.964
- I LOVE THIS.
- YEAH.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.632
- AND I LOVE YOU.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.834
AND I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR BRINGING ME ON THIS TRIP.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.070
- AW, DAD.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.505
- AND, FORREST,
I WANT TO SEE YOU

16:45.538 --> 16:47.107
GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.475
- AW.
- I DO.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.343
AND AS SOON AS WE'RE OFF
THIS SPACESHIP,

16:50.377 --> 16:52.845
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING IN MY
POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS.

16:52.879 --> 16:55.415
A DAUGHTER DOESN'T LISTEN
TO ANYONE MORE THAN THEIR POP.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.485
BELIEVE ME.
- OKAY.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.853
- TEN, NINE...

17:00.887 --> 17:04.091
all:
EIGHT, SEVEN, SIX,

17:04.091 --> 17:10.097
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.398
- INITIATE LAUNCH.

17:11.431 --> 17:13.400
- THAT'S ONE SMALL STEP
FOR MAN--

17:13.433 --> 17:16.169
- NO.
JACK!

17:16.203 --> 17:20.840
- ALTITUDE, 300,360 FEET.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.210
WELCOME TO SPACE.

17:23.243 --> 17:24.877
[all screaming]
- OH, MY GOD.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.346
- OH, NO!
NO, JACK!

17:26.379 --> 17:27.780
JACK!
- OH, MY GOD, IS HE--

17:27.814 --> 17:28.881
- JACK, YOU CANNOT BE DEAD!

17:28.915 --> 17:29.949
THERE'S NO WAY!

17:29.982 --> 17:31.451
YOU GOT TO TALK TO SUZANNE!

17:31.484 --> 17:33.353
JACK, YOU GOT TO TALK
TO SUZANNE!

17:33.386 --> 17:35.255
OH--OH, NO.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.357
BUT HE WAS DEAD.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.892
MY DEAR VIEWER,
IT SADDENS ME TO SAY

17:39.926 --> 17:43.130
THAT JACK'S TRAGIC FAILURE
TO FASTEN HIS SAFETY HARNESS

17:43.130 --> 17:46.133
HAD ENDED THE LIFE
OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY MAN

17:46.133 --> 17:50.903
AND CAST A HORRIBLE PALL
OVER THIS JOURNEY INTO SPACE.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.740
BUT THE JOURNEY WOULD GO ON.

17:55.642 --> 17:58.478
- GUYS, I'M REALLY SORRY
TO DO THIS,

17:58.511 --> 18:02.982
BUT I'VE KIND OF PROMISED
TO PROMOTE PRODUCTS,

18:03.015 --> 18:05.718
SO, UH...

18:05.752 --> 18:07.354
STEAK 'N SHAKE--

18:07.387 --> 18:10.623
WHERE THE STEAKBURGER'S
ALWAYS OUT OF THIS WORLD.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.225
U-HAUL--

18:12.259 --> 18:14.561
WHETHER IT'S ONE SMALL STEP
OR ONE GIANT LEAP,

18:14.594 --> 18:16.829
U-HAUL WILL GET YOU THERE.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.465
KRISPY KREME--

18:18.498 --> 18:20.800
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
WHO BROUGHT THE DOUGHNUTS?

18:20.833 --> 18:21.834
HUH?

18:24.837 --> 18:27.407
- MY FELLOW TRAVELERS HAD FORKED
OVER A LOT OF MONEY

18:27.440 --> 18:29.376
FOR THIS ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
EXPERIENCE,

18:29.409 --> 18:32.745
SO YOU COULDN'T BLAME THEM FOR
DOING WHAT THEY CAME HERE TO DO.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.215
- SO...
- WAIT. ARE--ARE YOU...

18:35.248 --> 18:37.083
- I DON'T KNOW.
- OH, MY GOD.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.385
OH, MY GOD.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.488
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.989
BRYCE.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.591
- WILL YOU MARRY ME, CARRIE?

18:44.624 --> 18:46.426
- OH, IT'S GORGEOUS.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.761
OF COURSE I WILL.
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.663
IS THIS ON TAPE?
- DID WE GET IT ON TAPE?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.365
- WAIT. WAS THAT--
- UH...

18:52.399 --> 18:55.868
- WAS THAT BODY IN FRONT
OF THERE THE WHOLE TIME?

18:58.905 --> 19:02.709
- I'M SORRY, JACK,
BUT I HAVE TO DO THIS.

19:04.511 --> 19:08.815
BEING UP IN SPACE IS
A TRULY INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.251
AND LOOKING DOWN
ON ALL OF HUMANITY,

19:11.284 --> 19:15.222
THE MIRACLE OF LIFE
IS INDESCRIBABLY PROFOUND,

19:15.222 --> 19:18.858
AND THE BEAUTY OF OUR PLANET
IS SIMPLY AWE-INSPIRING.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.427
MY SOUL EXALTS AT THE...
- BRACE FOR LANDING.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.262
- AT THE WONDERS OF OUR...
[thrusters roar]

19:22.295 --> 19:24.597
UNIVERSE.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.633
IT'S BEAUTIFUL UP HERE.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.235
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.605
JACK'S BODY
WAS RETURNING TO EARTH...

19:32.639 --> 19:34.374
- WE'RE ENGAGED!
- BUT HIS SOUL WOULD REMAIN

19:34.407 --> 19:36.443
WHERE HE HAD ALWAYS
WANTED IT TO BE...

19:36.476 --> 19:37.977
- LANCE, HOW WAS IT?

19:38.010 --> 19:39.712
- EH.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.449
- THOUGH I WASN'T SURE SUZANNE
WOULD SEE IT THAT WAY.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.984
- HOW WAS IT?
- I HAVE, UH--I HAVE GOOD NEWS,

19:45.017 --> 19:46.453
AND I HAVE REALLY,
REALLY BAD NEWS...

19:46.486 --> 19:47.887
- WHERE'S MY FATHER?
- FOR YOU.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.289
- OH, MY GOD.
- THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.457
- OH, MY GOD.
- WHERE'S MY FATHER?

19:50.490 --> 19:51.458
OH, MY GOD!
- JACK!

19:51.491 --> 19:52.825
OH, MY GOD!
JACK!

19:52.859 --> 19:56.563
GOD!
[sobbing]

19:56.596 --> 19:58.398
- YOU KILLED MY FATHER
IN OUTER SPACE?

19:58.431 --> 20:00.867
- WELL, NO.
- SO WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.835
- YOU SAID THERE WAS GOOD NEWS
AND BAD NEWS, FORREST.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.237
WHAT'S THE GOOD NEWS?

20:04.271 --> 20:05.572
- SPACE WAS AMAZING?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.507
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

20:07.540 --> 20:10.843
- I DIDN'T--
- NOBODY WANTS YOU, FORREST!

20:10.877 --> 20:13.646
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME,
MUSTACHE!

20:13.680 --> 20:14.647
MOM!
- [sobbing]

20:14.681 --> 20:16.549
OH, BABY.
- DADDY.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.719
- DADDY'S GONE!
- DADDY'S GONE!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.754
YOU MONSTER!

20:21.788 --> 20:24.691
YOU'RE A BASTARD!

20:30.730 --> 20:35.402
- MY ONLY CONSOLATION IS THAT
JACK DIED DOING WHAT HE LOVED.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.938
- ALMOST GETTING INTO SPACE.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.573
- RIGHT.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.609
IF YOU'RE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO GO INTO OUTER SPACE,

20:42.642 --> 20:44.744
YOU'LL PROBABLY CHOOSE TO TRAVEL
WITHOUT A CORPSE

20:44.777 --> 20:48.915
AND WILL HAVE AN EVEN MORE
MAJESTIC EXPERIENCE THAN I DID.

20:48.948 --> 20:52.952
SPACE TRAVEL--
A VERY SOMBER FIVE STARS.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.207
[Forrest screaming]
- * AMAZING GRACE

21:15.241 --> 21:17.209
* HOW SWEET...

21:17.243 --> 21:19.779
- OH, I KILLED MY FATHER-IN-LAW!
- * THE SOUND

21:19.812 --> 21:21.981
- OH, JACK! OH, JACK!
- * THAT SAVED

21:22.014 --> 21:26.453
* A WRETCH LIKE ME
- OH, SHE'S GONNA KILL--
