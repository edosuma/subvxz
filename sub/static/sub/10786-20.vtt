WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:03.291
Joey:
EVER HAVE ONE OF THOSE DAYS

00:03.291 --> 00:04.792
YOU WISH YOU COULD LIVE
ALL OVER AGAIN?

00:09.333 --> 00:13.667
Andie: OH, HEY, LOOK.
THERE'S DAWSON AND HIS DAD.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.542
Mitch:
GOT THE CHAMPAGNE?

00:22.542 --> 00:23.667
RIGHT HERE. OOP!

00:23.667 --> 00:25.583
WHOA. THAT WAS
ALMOST A DISASTER.

00:25.583 --> 00:27.542
HEY, GUYS.

00:27.542 --> 00:28.792
HELLO.
HEY.

00:28.792 --> 00:30.333
BUZZ.

00:30.333 --> 00:31.458
SO, UH, WHERE'S JOEY?

00:31.458 --> 00:33.041
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
COMING WITH US.

00:33.041 --> 00:34.291
SHE, UH, WANTED TO STOP
AT A LIBRARY FIRST

00:34.291 --> 00:36.959
AND PLOW
THROUGH THAT WATERGATE
HISTORY ASSIGNMENT.

00:36.959 --> 00:39.792
COME ON.
LET'S GO, PACEY.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.250
IT'S YOUR BOAT
WE'RE PLANNING
ON CHRISTENING.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.208
I OWN A BOAT?

00:44.208 --> 00:45.375
MMM.

00:45.375 --> 00:48.500
NO, WE HAVE TO STOP
DOING THIS. IT'S WRONG.

00:48.500 --> 00:49.708
YES. DEAD WRONG.

00:49.708 --> 00:51.166
PACEY.

00:51.166 --> 00:53.458
LOOK, WE'VE BEEN
IN DENIAL ALL WEEK.

00:53.458 --> 00:55.250
I MEAN, WHEN WE'RE
AROUND OTHER PEOPLE,

00:55.250 --> 00:56.875
WE PRETEND LIKE
NOTHING'S CHANGED,

00:56.875 --> 00:58.875
AND THEN
THE MINUTE WE'RE ALONE,
IT TURNS INTO THIS.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.041
THIS WHAT?

01:00.041 --> 01:02.542
WELL, THIS...
EMBARRASSING
GROPE FEST.

01:02.542 --> 01:04.417
YEAH, I GUESS THIS IS
KIND OF EMBARRASSING, HUH?

01:04.417 --> 01:07.041
ESPECIALLY FOR YOU,
GIVEN HOW MUCH
YOU PROTESTED.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.542
I DID NOT PROTEST.

01:08.542 --> 01:09.166
YOU DID TOO.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.375
WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.041
WHAT?

01:15.041 --> 01:16.166
I GOTTA TELL HIM, JO.

01:16.166 --> 01:19.625
WE DO. WE GOTTA TELL HIM
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

01:19.625 --> 01:22.291
BECAUSE THE LONGER
WE WAIT, JO,
THE WORSE IT GETS.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.083
NO, PACEY.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.417
I'VE TRIED.

01:25.417 --> 01:26.583
I'VE TRIED
PLENTY OF TIMES TO--

01:26.583 --> 01:29.208
EVERY TIME
I SEE THE GUY NOW,
I JUST FEEL LIKE--

01:29.208 --> 01:31.708
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BOTHER
FILLING IN THE EXPLETIVE, OK?

01:31.708 --> 01:35.250
I MEAN, THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY THE EASIEST THING
I'VE EVER HAD TO DO, PACEY--

01:35.250 --> 01:37.583
TELLING DAWSON THAT
WHILE HE WASN'T LOOKING,

01:37.583 --> 01:40.250
I DEVELOPED THIS BIZARRE
GRAVITATIONAL PULL

01:40.250 --> 01:42.959
TOWARDS HIS BEST FRIEND,
AND I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HIM

01:42.959 --> 01:44.583
OR WANTING TO BE NEAR HIM

01:44.583 --> 01:46.792
OR WANTING TO KISS HIM
ALL THE TIME.

01:54.208 --> 01:55.625
I'LL DO IT.

01:57.041 --> 01:58.041
WHAT?

01:58.041 --> 01:59.250
I'LL TELL HIM.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.125
NO, I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT.

02:01.125 --> 02:02.750
IT'S--THIS IS
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.417
JO, IT'S NOT
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.750
I'M THE ONE
THAT STARTED THIS,
REMEMBER?

02:06.750 --> 02:08.500
I'M THE ONE
THAT GOT YOU
INTO THIS SITUATION.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.959
AND, FRANKLY,
THE ONLY WAY

02:09.959 --> 02:11.291
THAT I WANT TO SAVE
MY FRIENDSHIP
WITH DAWSON

02:11.291 --> 02:13.792
IS TO BE COMPLETELY
HONEST WITH HIM,
SO I GOTTA DO THIS.

02:13.792 --> 02:15.625
ALL I NEED
IS ONE DAY.

02:15.625 --> 02:16.291
JUST ONE DAY.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.500
ONE DAY.

02:22.500 --> 02:23.917
YES.

02:23.917 --> 02:25.542
ONE DAY.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.667
NO, SHE'S NOT LATE.
SHE'S AN HOUR LATE.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.417
WHEN PEOPLE ARE LATE,
THEY'RE, LIKE,
15 MINUTES LATE.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.708
ALL RIGHT,
HERE'S THE DEAL.

03:20.708 --> 03:22.166
THERE'S AN APOLOGETIC

03:22.166 --> 03:24.500
YET SOMEWHAT
INCOHERENT MESSAGE
ON THE MACHINE FOR YOU

03:24.500 --> 03:25.875
FROM SOMEONE NAMED NORA.

03:25.875 --> 03:28.166
IT SEEMS SHE GOT CONFUSED,
THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM
FOR THE DAY.

03:28.166 --> 03:31.375
NOW SHE'S STUCK AT WORK
AND CAN'T GET FREE
UNTIL THIS EVENING.

03:31.375 --> 03:33.625
SPEAKING OF WORK...

03:33.625 --> 03:35.500
YOU'RE NOT ON DUTY
TODAY, ARE YOU?

03:35.500 --> 03:37.583
AH, NO, NO, NO.
LITTLE BROTHER,

03:37.583 --> 03:38.542
THIS JUVENILE

03:38.542 --> 03:39.792
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

03:39.792 --> 03:41.166
BUT, DOUG,
I GOT THIS ONE THING
I GOTTA DO, MAN,

03:41.166 --> 03:43.834
AND IT KIND OF
RANKS HIGH UP THERE
ON THE IMPORTANCE LIST.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.583
SO...LOOK, I'LL JUST DO
THIS ONE THING.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.542
I'LL GO, I'LL DO IT,
I'LL COME RIGHT BACK.
I SWEAR.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.875
HAVE YOU EVER
NOTICED HOW YOUR
ONE LITTLE THINGS

03:49.875 --> 03:51.208
TEND TO MULTIPLY?

03:51.208 --> 03:52.542
DOUG,
IT'S JUST ONE THING.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.125
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I SWEAR.
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE--

03:54.125 --> 03:55.125
PACEY.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.125
DOUGIE.

03:56.125 --> 03:58.959
I KNOW HE'S A VERY
RESPECTABLE YOUNG MAN,

03:58.959 --> 04:00.917
AND WE CERTAINLY
HAVE NO REASON

04:00.917 --> 04:03.417
TO SUSPECT HIM OF
ILL INTENTIONS, BUT...

04:03.417 --> 04:06.208
WITH NO ONE HERE
TO CHAPERONE...

04:06.208 --> 04:07.542
AH, YOU NEVER KNOW

04:07.542 --> 04:09.208
WHAT SORT OF HIGH JINKS
MIGHT ENSUE.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.834
THIS IS NO LAUGHING
MATTER, JENNIFER.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.834
I ESTABLISHED THESE
RULES NOT BECAUSE
I DON'T TRUST YOU,

04:14.834 --> 04:16.083
BUT BECAUSE
THE SEXUAL IMPULSES

04:16.083 --> 04:18.250
OF A TEENAGE BOY--

04:18.250 --> 04:19.416
OK, GRAMS, I THINK

04:19.416 --> 04:20.458
THAT YOU'RE GOING
OUT ON A LIMB HERE
FOR NOTHING.

04:20.458 --> 04:21.291
I ASSURE YOU THAT
WHATEVER SEXUAL IMPULSES

04:21.291 --> 04:23.667
HENRY PARKER
MAY THROW AT ME

04:23.667 --> 04:25.417
I AM PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF HANDLING.

04:45.041 --> 04:47.083
HEY, PACE.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.041
HEY.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.959
NOBODY HOME?

04:52.166 --> 04:54.333
I DON'T KNOW, ACTUALLY.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.625
COULD KNOCK
AND FIND OUT.

04:57.625 --> 05:00.291
I COULD JUST
WALK RIGHT IN, YOU KNOW.

05:00.291 --> 05:01.792
THEY NEVER LOCK IT.

05:01.792 --> 05:04.125
I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
SINCE I WAS 5 YEARS OLD,

05:04.125 --> 05:06.750
JUST WALKING RIGHT THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR,
MAKING MYSELF AT HOME.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.708
SHE WANTS TO BE
WITH YOU, PACE.

05:09.708 --> 05:11.125
SHE DOES.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.291
AND YOU KNOW THIS HOW?

05:14.291 --> 05:16.500
TOLD ME SO
THIS MORNING.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.208
[CHUCKLES]

05:18.208 --> 05:19.875
[SIGHS]

05:19.875 --> 05:22.125
WHY AM I NOT HAPPY
TO HEAR THAT RIGHT NOW?

05:22.125 --> 05:23.417
WELL, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

05:23.417 --> 05:26.667
YOU'VE GOTTA WALK
THROUGH THAT FRONT DOOR

05:26.667 --> 05:28.333
AND TELL
YOUR BEST FRIEND

05:28.333 --> 05:30.458
THAT THE ONLY GIRL
IN THE UNIVERSE
HE CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT...

05:30.458 --> 05:33.291
IS THE SAME ONE
THAT I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.166
YEAH.

05:35.166 --> 05:38.458
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION
WITH HIM IN MY HEAD

05:38.458 --> 05:39.125
A THOUSAND TIMES.

05:39.125 --> 05:41.333
YEAH? HOW'S IT GO?

05:41.333 --> 05:42.625
OH, YOU KNOW,

05:42.625 --> 05:45.125
DAWSON SAYING SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES OF...

05:45.125 --> 05:47.333
"VAYA CON DIOS, PACE.

05:47.333 --> 05:50.166
I HAD MY SHOT
AT MAKING HER HAPPY.

05:50.166 --> 05:52.583
NOW...WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE IT A TRY?"

05:52.583 --> 05:54.500
IT COULD HAPPEN.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.000
JUST MINUS
THE SPANISH PART.

05:56.000 --> 05:56.667
YEAH.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.333
HEY, GUYS.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.000
IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR DAWSON,
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.667
DID HE SAY WHERE
HE WAS GOING?

06:03.667 --> 06:06.458
YEAH. HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT THE LIBRARY.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.208
PACEY.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.208
HI.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.208
HEY.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.458
YOU'RE LOOKING HAPPY.

06:17.458 --> 06:19.834
IS THIS JUST
YOUR USUAL LIBRARY GLOW?

06:19.834 --> 06:22.625
YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
FREE BOOKS MAKE ME GIDDY.

06:22.625 --> 06:23.834
KRUDSKI.

06:23.834 --> 06:26.542
STUDYING ON A SATURDAY,
WITTER.

06:26.542 --> 06:27.542
THAT'S MOST UNLIKE YOU.

06:27.542 --> 06:30.750
SO, UH, I'LL SEE YOU
TONIGHT, ANDIE?

06:31.125 --> 06:32.959
YEAH.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.708
SEE YOU, MAN.

06:37.625 --> 06:38.834
TONIGHT, HUH?

06:39.875 --> 06:41.667
YEAH. UH...

06:41.667 --> 06:44.000
WE WERE THINKING ABOUT
GETTING DINNER OR SOMETHING--

06:44.000 --> 06:45.750
NO, HEY, LOOK, LOOK.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.875
A GIRL'S GOTTA EAT,
HUH?

06:47.875 --> 06:49.708
SO, UH, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

06:49.708 --> 06:50.708
I MEAN, YOU'RE
NOT STUDYING, ARE YOU?

06:50.708 --> 06:52.041
NO. NOT STUDYING.
LOOKING FOR DAWSON.

06:52.041 --> 06:52.708
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM,
HAVE YOU?

06:52.708 --> 06:54.458
NOPE. HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.875
WELL, I'LL LET YOU
GET BACK TO, UH...

06:56.875 --> 06:58.291
I'LL SEE YOU LATER,
ANDIE.

06:58.291 --> 06:58.542
YEAH.

07:03.208 --> 07:05.417
NO, NO, NO, BUZZ!

07:05.417 --> 07:07.583
LISTEN TO ME.
THIS IS NOT A TOY.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.500
ALL RIGHT? THIS IS
AN ANSWERING MACHINE.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.458
THIS WAS MY
ANSWERING MACHINE

07:11.458 --> 07:11.917
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:11.917 --> 07:13.250
WH-WHAT--

07:13.250 --> 07:15.917
BUZZ, WHERE'S THE TAPE?

07:15.917 --> 07:16.250
STOP BOUNCING!

07:16.250 --> 07:18.917
STOP--

07:18.917 --> 07:20.083
YEAH!

07:20.083 --> 07:21.583
AND I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BORING.

07:21.583 --> 07:22.583
SEE THAT?

07:22.583 --> 07:23.542
GAMEBOY.

07:23.542 --> 07:25.166
IT'S POKÉMON BLUE, MAN.
GO TO IT.

07:25.166 --> 07:26.375
YEAH, THAT'S
REALLY GREAT.

07:26.375 --> 07:28.375
WHERE THE HELL
HAVE YOU BEEN?

07:28.375 --> 07:30.000
LOOK AT THIS.
IT'S RUINED.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.708
DOUG, I'M SORRY.

07:31.708 --> 07:33.917
LOOK, ME AND JOEY
CAME TO A REALLY
IMPORTANT DECISION.

07:33.917 --> 07:35.083
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

07:35.083 --> 07:37.834
SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU AND JOEY
DECIDING ANYTHING?

07:37.834 --> 07:38.750
YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE THIS ONE,

07:38.750 --> 07:41.041
'CAUSE IT TURNS OUT
YOU WERE RIGHT.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.291
SHE'S INTO ME, MAN.

07:42.291 --> 07:44.458
THAT'S WHY SHE GOT
SO FREAKED OUT
WHEN I KISSED HER.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.500
REALLY?

07:45.500 --> 07:46.458
YEAH.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.834
SO THEN YOU TOLD DAWSON?

07:50.000 --> 07:53.542
UH...NO, NOT EXACTLY.

07:53.542 --> 07:56.000
THAT'S WHAT
I WAS TRYING TO DO
ALL MORNING, DOUG.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.959
REMEMBER
THE LITTLE ERRAND
THAT I HAD TO RUN,

07:57.959 --> 08:00.959
BUT IT JUST...
TURNED INTO THIS
WILD GOOSE CHASE, AND...

08:00.959 --> 08:03.875
I REALLY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GOING TO TAKE
THAT LONG. I'M SORRY.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.458
LOOK.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.458
TELLING DAWSON
THAT YOU KISSED JOEY
IN A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS

08:07.458 --> 08:09.166
IS A HELL OF A LOT DIFFERENT
THAN SNEAKING AROUND WITH HER

08:09.166 --> 08:11.208
BEHIND HIS BACK,
DON'T YOU THINK?

08:11.208 --> 08:12.583
LOOK, PACEY,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,
JOEY AND DAWSON,

08:12.583 --> 08:14.792
THEY'RE GONNA STAY FRIENDS
OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT THEY ARE,

08:14.792 --> 08:15.875
AND YOU'RE GONNA
END UP ALONE.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.166
ALL RIGHT?
NO GIRLFRIEND,

08:17.166 --> 08:20.250
NO FRIEND,
JUST COMPLETELY
AND UTTERLY ALONE.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.959
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:23.959 --> 08:25.500
I WAS RIGHT BEFORE,
WASN'T I?

08:39.500 --> 08:40.582
HEY.

08:40.582 --> 08:42.375
HEY.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.833
HEY, JO, WHAT'S WRONG?

08:43.833 --> 08:45.458
WHAT'S WRONG?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.750
LOOK, PACEY...

08:47.750 --> 08:49.583
WE CAN'T DO THIS, OK?

08:49.583 --> 08:51.166
CAN'T DO WHAT?

08:51.166 --> 08:52.500
I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL HIM, OK?

08:52.500 --> 08:55.750
I MEAN, THINGS ARE
REALLY COMPLICATED
BETWEEN ME AND DAWSON,

08:55.750 --> 08:58.125
AND IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.
IT'S JUST...

08:58.125 --> 08:59.333
LOOK...

08:59.333 --> 09:00.542
IT HAS TO COME
FROM ME, OR ELSE...

09:00.542 --> 09:01.959
IT'S GOING
TO RUIN EVERYTHING.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.959
OK. OK.

09:03.959 --> 09:05.291
THAT'S OK.
IT'S OK.

09:05.291 --> 09:07.250
JUST CALM DOWN, JO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

09:07.250 --> 09:10.000
WE'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO, OK?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.458
I MEAN...

09:11.458 --> 09:14.959
IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH...

09:14.959 --> 09:19.291
I'VE BEEN IN THE PROCESS
OF CHICKENING OUT
THE WHOLE WAY OVER HERE.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.500
MAYBE IT'S
A SIGN, PACEY.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.542
A SIGN OF WHAT?

09:25.542 --> 09:28.500
IT'S JUST THAT
FOR SO LONG,

09:28.500 --> 09:31.417
HE'S BEEN EVERYTHING
TO ME, PACEY.

09:31.417 --> 09:32.458
I MEAN, THIS GUY
HAS BEEN MY FAMILY

09:32.458 --> 09:35.375
WHEN I HAVEN'T
HAD ONE,

09:35.375 --> 09:36.166
AND HE'S THE ONE
PERSON IN MY LIFE

09:36.166 --> 09:37.208
THAT I CAN
ALWAYS DEPEND ON,

09:37.208 --> 09:38.750
AND--AND THIS?

09:38.750 --> 09:39.750
THIS IS
GONNA KILL HIM.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.792
YOU NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION
OF TELLING HIM, DID YOU?

09:48.917 --> 09:50.792
YOU DIDN'T COME OVER HERE
TONIGHT TO TELL HIM.

09:50.792 --> 09:53.250
YOU CAME HERE TO STOP ME
FROM TELLING HIM.

09:53.250 --> 09:56.375
NO. I TRIED TO TELL HIM.
I WENT UP THERE
AND I TRIED.

09:56.375 --> 09:57.792
OF COURSE YOU DID.

09:57.792 --> 09:58.417
LET ME GUESS.

09:58.417 --> 10:02.458
YOU FAILED, RIGHT?

10:02.458 --> 10:06.125
Dawson: I THOUGHT I
HEARD SOMETHING
OUT HERE.

10:06.625 --> 10:07.291
DAWSON, UH...

10:07.291 --> 10:09.250
WE WERE JUST,
UH--

10:09.250 --> 10:10.708
HAVING AN ARGUMENT.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.917
OBVIOUSLY.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.000
WHAT ABOUT?

10:18.041 --> 10:18.750
MMM...

10:21.708 --> 10:22.834
US, DAWSON.

10:28.458 --> 10:29.792
WE WERE ARGUING
ABOUT US.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.291
ME AND JOEY.
THERE'S AN US HERE NOW.

10:44.417 --> 10:45.417
Joey: EVER HAVE
ONE OF THOSE DAYS

10:45.417 --> 10:46.917
YOU WISH YOU COULD LIVE
ALL OVER AGAIN?

10:52.625 --> 10:55.792
Andie: OH, HEY, LOOK.
THERE'S DAWSON AND HIS DAD.

10:56.625 --> 10:59.208
Mitch:
GOT THE CHAMPAGNE?

10:59.208 --> 11:00.458
RIGHT HERE. OOP!

11:00.458 --> 11:03.250
WHOA. THAT WAS
ALMOST A DISASTER.

11:03.250 --> 11:03.875
HEY, GUYS.

11:03.875 --> 11:05.250
HELLO.
HEY.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.583
BUZZ.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.333
SO, UH, WHERE'S JOEY?

11:08.333 --> 11:09.375
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
COMING WITH US.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.625
SHE, UH, WANTED TO STOP
AT A LIBRARY FIRST

11:10.625 --> 11:13.500
AND PLOW
THROUGH THAT WATERGATE
HISTORY ASSIGNMENT.

11:13.500 --> 11:17.000
OH, SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I FINALLY GOT THROUGH
ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.250
SO IF YOU'D LIKE
YOUR TAPE BACK,
I CAN RETURN IT NOW.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.667
OK. I'LL COME BY
AND PICK IT UP.
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

11:20.667 --> 11:21.959
INCREDIBLE MOVIE.

11:21.959 --> 11:24.542
BUT, UH, HENRY
DIDN'T FEEL AS THOUGH
THERE WERE ENOUGH

11:24.542 --> 11:26.500
CUTE TEENAGE GIRLS.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.667
Jack: HEY, DON'T
LOOK NOW,

11:27.667 --> 11:30.125
BUT I THINK
THAT'S THE CAPTAIN
OF THIS VESSEL.

11:30.125 --> 11:30.917
OH. WELL, I GUESS
WE CAN GET STARTED.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.458
NOT WITHOUT THIS,
WE CAN'T.

11:34.333 --> 11:35.583
HEY.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.792
HI.

11:36.792 --> 11:38.000
AS PROMISED.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.583
HEY. WOW. WHOA.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.000
CHAMPAGNE.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.500
THANK YOU.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.041
NICE,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

11:44.041 --> 11:45.125
SPARKLING
APPLE CIDER

11:45.125 --> 11:46.166
WOULD HAVE
PROBABLY WORKED
JUST AS WELL.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.166
Dawson: NOT FOR
THIS OCCASION, MAN.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.750
THIS IS A MONUMENTAL
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.083
YOU TOOK SOMETHING
THAT WAS DESTINED
FOR THE SCRAP HEAP...

11:51.083 --> 11:52.208
HEY.

11:52.208 --> 11:56.166
HEY.

11:56.166 --> 11:57.083
NO, I--

11:57.083 --> 11:57.959
IF YOU COME BY
AROUND 2:00,

11:57.959 --> 12:00.208
MY GRAMS WILL BE
GONE, ALL RIGHT?

12:01.208 --> 12:03.125
NO--

12:03.125 --> 12:04.500
NO, NO.
ALL RIGHT,

12:04.500 --> 12:05.875
I'M TAKING JOEY
TO THE LIBRARY,

12:05.875 --> 12:07.708
I'M GONNA
GIVE GRAMS
HER CAR BACK,

12:07.708 --> 12:10.375
AND I WILL
SEE YOU LATER.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.291
OK, BYE.

12:13.959 --> 12:14.792
THANKS AGAIN
FOR THE RIDE, JEN.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.542
OH, GOD, DON'T
WORRY ABOUT IT.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.458
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO GO BY THIS MORNING,

12:18.458 --> 12:19.834
AND I GOT KIND
OF BUSY, AND...

12:19.834 --> 12:21.708
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

12:22.708 --> 12:23.834
UNLESS, OF COURSE,

12:23.834 --> 12:27.166
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT
TO EXPLAIN.

12:27.166 --> 12:30.750
RECENTLY
YOU AND I SPOKE ABOUT
UNREQUITED FEELINGS

12:30.750 --> 12:31.834
THAT A CERTAIN SOMEONE--

12:31.834 --> 12:33.834
NAMELY PACEY?

12:33.834 --> 12:36.417
NAMELY PACEY, UH...

12:36.417 --> 12:38.208
MAY HAVE HAD FOR ME.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.458
AND HOW THOSE
UNREQUITED FEELINGS

12:41.458 --> 12:44.917
EXPRESS THEMSELVES
IN THE FORM OF A KISS.

12:47.792 --> 12:49.208
THEY'RE NOT...

12:49.208 --> 12:50.417
UM...

12:50.417 --> 12:51.792
UNREQUITED, THAT IS.

12:51.792 --> 12:54.208
THEY ARE ACTUALLY, UH...

12:54.208 --> 12:56.083
THEY'RE
VERY MUCH REQUITED.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.834
OK, SO YOU'VE
KISSED BACK
A CERTAIN SOMEONE,

12:58.834 --> 13:00.333
NAMELY PACEY...

13:00.333 --> 13:03.792
AND...
YOU'D LIKE FOR THAT
TO CONTINUE?

13:03.792 --> 13:06.000
I THINK SO. I MEAN...

13:07.417 --> 13:10.041
YES.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.750
BUT THE THING IS,

13:11.750 --> 13:13.792
MY FEELINGS
HAVE BEEN CLOUDED
BY MY FEAR

13:13.792 --> 13:17.125
OF WHAT DAWSON
WILL DO OR SAY
ONCE HE KNOWS.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.125
JOEY,
IF YOU'RE ASKING ME

13:18.125 --> 13:19.750
WHETHER OR NOT
YOU SHOULD TELL DAWSON...

13:19.750 --> 13:22.959
THE ANSWER'S
A BIG FAT YES.

13:22.959 --> 13:23.875
I KNOW.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.625
WE'RE GOING
TO TELL HIM.

13:25.625 --> 13:27.500
I MEAN, PACEY'S
GOING TO DO IT
TODAY, AND...

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
HE WANTED TO.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.041
I TRIED. I--I DID.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.542
I TRIED PLENTY
OF TIMES. IT'S--

13:31.542 --> 13:34.291
IT'S JUST THAT...

13:34.291 --> 13:35.917
WHEN WE TELL HIM...

13:35.917 --> 13:37.458
DAWSON GETS HURT.

13:37.458 --> 13:38.750
AND IF I TELL PACEY
NOT TO TELL HIM--

13:38.750 --> 13:40.417
THEN PACEY'S
GONNA GET HURT.

13:40.417 --> 13:42.458
[SIGHS] YEAH.

13:42.458 --> 13:43.875
SO...

13:43.875 --> 13:46.625
WHATEVER I DO,
I'M THE VILLAIN.

13:46.625 --> 13:49.000
I MEAN, THE GIRL'S
ALWAYS THE VILLAIN,
RIGHT?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.291
IN STORIES LIKE THESE,
SHE'S ALWAYS SOME...

13:51.291 --> 13:52.750
WICKED, CONNIVING WHORE

13:52.750 --> 13:55.250
WHO MANIPULATES HER WAY
BETWEEN 2 BROTHERS
OR 2 BEST FRIENDS.

13:55.250 --> 13:57.542
OK, JOEY, KEEP IN MIND
THAT MOST OF THOSE STORIES

13:57.542 --> 13:58.166
HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY MEN.

14:00.083 --> 14:01.333
I REALLY WISH
I WAS MORE LIKE YOU.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.667
OH, YEAH.

14:03.667 --> 14:04.750
YOU FEEL THINGS,
AND YOU ACT ON THEM.

14:04.750 --> 14:07.375
PACEY DOES
THE SAME THING.

14:07.375 --> 14:09.625
HE'S...FEARLESS.

14:09.625 --> 14:11.500
ALL RIGHT, I'LL LET YOU IN
ON A LITTLE SECRET

14:11.500 --> 14:12.500
ABOUT
THE SO-CALLED FEARLESS.

14:12.500 --> 14:15.000
WE'RE NOT AS TOUGH
AS YOU THINK WE ARE.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.083
AND PACEY'S HEART
CAN BREAK

14:19.083 --> 14:21.834
JUST AS EASILY
AS THE NEXT GUY.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.500
MAYBE EVEN MORE SO,

14:23.500 --> 14:24.500
CONSIDERING
IT WAS ALREADY BROKEN

14:24.500 --> 14:25.125
WHEN YOU GOT THERE.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.500
HEY. LADY.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.041
20-MINUTE TIME LIMIT
ON THESE THINGS,
RIGHT?

14:57.041 --> 14:59.583
SORRY, ANDIE.
I WAS JUST FINISHING UP
THE WATERGATE ASSIGNMENT.

14:59.583 --> 15:00.291
HOW ABOUT YOU?

15:00.291 --> 15:01.959
OH,
NOWHERE NEAR DONE.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.583
BUT I'M TAKING OFF
ANYWAY.

15:03.583 --> 15:04.917
I HAVE A DATE
TONIGHT.

15:04.917 --> 15:05.917
WILL?

15:05.917 --> 15:06.875
YEAH.

15:06.875 --> 15:09.458
I LIKE HIM.
I DO.

15:09.458 --> 15:11.000
AND HE'S SMART,
WAY SMART.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.750
AND HE HAS NO IDEA
HOW CUTE HE IS.

15:13.750 --> 15:16.667
WHICH IS KEY, 'CAUSE
GOD SAVE US FROM
THE ONES WHO DO.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.542
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

15:20.166 --> 15:20.750
HE'S...

15:20.750 --> 15:22.417
HE'S
NOT PACEY.

15:22.417 --> 15:24.542
OHH!

15:24.542 --> 15:25.500
PATHETIC.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.083
I KNOW. I KNOW.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.083
AND I THOUGHT
I WAS OVER HIM.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.792
I REALLY,
REALLY DID.

15:30.792 --> 15:33.375
BUT THEN
I BUMPED INTO HIM
A LITTLE WHILE AGO,

15:33.375 --> 15:36.250
AND...I MEAN,
TECHNICALLY WE'RE
FRIENDS, RIGHT?

15:36.250 --> 15:38.208
AND THAT'S
HOW I PLAYED IT.

15:38.208 --> 15:40.583
BUT THEN IT'S, LIKE,
WHEN I SAW HIM,

15:40.583 --> 15:41.834
EVERY
IRRITATING/ADORABLE
THING HE EVER DID

15:41.834 --> 15:45.750
FLASHED BEFORE
MY EYES, AND...

15:45.750 --> 15:47.542
I MEAN, THAT'S
THE TRUE TEST,
RIGHT?

15:47.542 --> 15:50.000
WHEN YOU JUST BUMP
INTO SOMEBODY...

15:50.000 --> 15:54.708
AND IF YOU'RE
NOT OVER HIM, THEN
BOOM--FLOODGATES.

15:56.417 --> 15:56.875
HEY.

15:56.875 --> 15:57.583
DAWSON. UH--

15:57.583 --> 15:58.583
YOU HURRIED MUCH?

15:58.583 --> 15:59.917
YEAH. I JUST, UM...

15:59.917 --> 16:02.667
I MUST HAVE
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.458
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET
BESSIE AT HOME BY NOW. I--

16:04.458 --> 16:05.875
OK. I WANTED--
I WAS GONNA CALL YOU.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.458
DO YOU WANT TO DO
A MOVIE NIGHT TONIGHT?

16:07.458 --> 16:08.542
I'VE GOT TO HELP
MY MOM WITH SOMETHING,

16:08.542 --> 16:10.166
BUT I COULD PICK UP
A MOVIE ON MY WAY HOME.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.875
YOU KNOW,
I REALLY DON'T THINK
I'LL BE ABLE TO.

16:11.875 --> 16:12.875
MAYBE SOME
OTHER TIME, OK?

16:12.875 --> 16:14.041
OK. ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

16:14.041 --> 16:16.375
YEAH. OH, YEAH,
I'M FINE. I JUST--

16:16.375 --> 16:17.625
I HAVE TO, UH...

16:17.625 --> 16:18.417
I HAVE TO, UH...

16:18.417 --> 16:19.500
UH...

16:19.500 --> 16:22.125
UH...

16:22.125 --> 16:23.208
GO?

16:23.208 --> 16:24.166
YES.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.208
I GOTTA GO.

16:25.208 --> 16:26.291
BYE.

16:26.291 --> 16:27.458
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE YOU.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.750
BYE.

16:38.291 --> 16:39.333
Joey: PACEY?

16:39.333 --> 16:40.250
DOUG?

16:40.250 --> 16:42.083
OK, YOU'RE NOT THERE.
UM...

16:42.083 --> 16:43.417
LOOK, PACEY, UM,

16:43.417 --> 16:47.333
DON'T DO WHAT YOU SAID
YOU WERE GOING TO DO
TODAY, OK?

16:47.333 --> 16:48.708
DAWSON'S NOT EVEN HOME.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.291
I JUST
KIND OF RAN INTO HIM,

16:50.291 --> 16:51.625
AND--AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD WAIT.

16:51.625 --> 16:53.667
I THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT
UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME,
'CAUSE...

16:53.667 --> 16:56.375
I REALLY THINK
THAT I SHOULD BE
THE ONE TO TELL HIM.

16:56.375 --> 16:57.708
OK.

16:57.708 --> 17:00.333
[JOEY HANGS UP]

17:02.542 --> 17:04.916
Man in movie:
...NOTHING TO YOU.

17:04.916 --> 17:06.040
YOU WAIT.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.250
SHE'S NOT YOUR GIRL,
AND SHE--

17:07.250 --> 17:09.040
SHE IS MY GIRL.
I DON'T CARE
IF WE DID BREAK UP.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.208
YOU DON'T EVEN
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

17:11.208 --> 17:12.583
THAT DON'T MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE.

17:12.583 --> 17:14.125
I'VE ALWAYS LIVED HERE.
I'M GETTIN' HER BACK.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.916
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW,
SHE'S GONNA MARRY ME
ONE OF THESE DAYS

17:15.916 --> 17:16.959
WHEN I GET
A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY.

17:16.959 --> 17:18.040
SHE WON'T MARRY YOU.
SURE SHE WILL.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.165
WE ALWAYS MEANT
TO GET MARRIED.

17:19.165 --> 17:20.040
SHE'S GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE SOON.
I DOUBT...

17:20.040 --> 17:23.375
Dawson:
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.541
KIND OF. UM...

17:26.541 --> 17:28.541
I--I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU, DAWSON.

17:28.541 --> 17:29.750
UM...

17:30.959 --> 17:32.875
PACEY HASN'T
BEEN HERE, HAS HE?

17:32.875 --> 17:34.375
NO.

17:34.375 --> 17:35.875
IS HE
SUPPOSED TO BE?

17:35.875 --> 17:36.708
UH, NO.
ACTUALLY, UH...

17:36.708 --> 17:39.500
UM...NO.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.333
WHAT ARE YOU
WATCHING?

17:43.333 --> 17:45.250
THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.

17:46.917 --> 17:49.708
ISN'T THAT THE MOVIE
THAT WE SAW WHEN WE--

17:49.708 --> 17:51.583
OUR FIRST DATE.

17:51.583 --> 17:52.750
YEP.

17:52.750 --> 17:53.959
YES, IT IS.

17:53.959 --> 17:56.917
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
A SUCCESSFUL EVENING,
WAS IT?

17:56.917 --> 17:57.750
AT LEAST NOT MOVIE-WISE.

17:57.750 --> 18:00.542
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:00.542 --> 18:02.000
WE NEVER
GOT TO SEE THE END.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.083
SO, UH...

18:09.083 --> 18:12.542
HOW DOES IT END,
DAWSON?

18:12.542 --> 18:15.458
WELL, THERE'S 3
FRIENDS THAT GREW UP
WITH EACH OTHER.

18:15.458 --> 18:18.417
JEFF BRIDGES
IS IN LOVE WITH
CYBILL SHEPHERD...

18:18.417 --> 18:22.166
AND SHE DUMPS HIM
AND BREAKS HIS HEART,
AND HE'S DEVASTATED...

18:22.166 --> 18:24.375
UM...AND SHE'S NOT. HA.

18:24.375 --> 18:27.125
SHE, UH...SHE JUST
KIND OF MOVES ON
TO THE OTHER GUY.

18:27.125 --> 18:31.417
AND, UM...IT DESTROYS
THEIR FRIENDSHIP.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.667
AND...THAT'S PRETTY
MUCH HOW IT ENDS--

18:35.667 --> 18:39.417
EVERYONE, UH, ALONE,
EVERYONE HATING
EACH OTHER.

18:39.417 --> 18:40.917
IT'S--[LAUGHS]

18:40.917 --> 18:42.959
IT'S REALLY
DEPRESSING, ACTUALLY.

18:42.959 --> 18:46.125
I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M WATCHING IT.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.375
UM...

18:49.375 --> 18:51.917
SO WHAT'D YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT?

18:55.166 --> 18:57.333
YOU KNOW, I JUST--
I ACTUALLY--

18:57.333 --> 19:00.333
I JUST REMEMBERED
THAT, UM, I PROMISED
BESSIE THAT I WOULD HELP...

19:00.333 --> 19:04.500
WATCH ALEXANDER TONIGHT,
AND SHE'S PROBABLY
WAITING FOR ME, SO, UM...

19:07.625 --> 19:09.542
BYE.

19:22.667 --> 19:23.834
HEY.

19:23.834 --> 19:24.708
HEY.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.667
HEY, JO.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.792
WHAT'S WRONG?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.834
LOOK, PACEY...

19:30.834 --> 19:32.667
WE CAN'T DO THIS, OK?

19:32.667 --> 19:33.625
WHAT? CAN'T DO WHAT?

19:33.625 --> 19:36.542
I HAVE TO BE THE ONE
TO TELL HIM, OK?

19:36.542 --> 19:38.583
I MEAN, THINGS ARE
REALLY COMPLICATED
BETWEEN ME AND DAWSON,

19:38.583 --> 19:40.583
AND IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.
IT'S JUST...

19:40.583 --> 19:42.667
LOOK--

19:42.667 --> 19:44.667
IT HAS TO COME FROM ME,
OR ELSE...

19:44.667 --> 19:45.291
IT'S GOING TO RUIN
EVERYTHING.

19:47.333 --> 19:49.125
Pacey: OK. OK.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.166
JUST CALM DOWN.
WE'LL DO WHATEVER
YOU WANT, ALL RIGHT?

19:51.166 --> 19:53.875
DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
[CHUCKLES]

19:53.875 --> 19:55.583
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
THE GOD'S HONEST TRUTH?

19:55.583 --> 19:59.000
YOU DIDN'T COME HERE
TONIGHT TO TELL HIM,
DID YOU?

19:59.000 --> 20:01.041
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE,
PACEY.

20:01.041 --> 20:03.834
I TRIED TO TELL HIM.
I WENT UP THERE,
AND I TRIED.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.917
OF COURSE YOU DID.
LET ME GUESS.

20:05.917 --> 20:07.959
YOU FAILED, RIGHT?

20:09.166 --> 20:11.792
Dawson:
I THOUGHT I HEARD
SOMETHING OUT HERE.

20:13.041 --> 20:15.291
DAWSON,
WE WERE JUST--

20:15.291 --> 20:17.500
HAVING AN ARGUMENT.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.041
OBVIOUSLY.

20:20.708 --> 20:21.500
WHAT ABOUT?

20:25.375 --> 20:26.500
UH...

20:26.500 --> 20:28.000
Pacey: US.

20:30.125 --> 20:33.333
WE WERE HAVING
AN ARGUMENT ABOUT US.

20:35.041 --> 20:37.542
THERE'S
AN US HERE NOW.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.875
I'M SORRY, MAN. WE DIDN'T
WANNA TELL YOU THIS WAY.

20:42.875 --> 20:43.417
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

20:48.959 --> 20:49.959
YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

20:49.959 --> 20:53.333
YEAH, I KNOW.

20:56.291 --> 20:59.083
Joey: EVER HAVE
ONE OF THOSE DAYS

20:59.083 --> 21:01.041
YOU WISH YOU COULD LIVE
ALL OVER AGAIN?

21:03.625 --> 21:06.583
Andie: OH, HEY, LOOK!
THERE'S DAWSON AND HIS DAD.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.583
Mitch:
GOT THE CHAMPAGNE?

21:10.583 --> 21:10.959
RIGHT HERE. OOP!

21:10.959 --> 21:12.708
WHOA!

21:12.708 --> 21:13.792
THAT WAS
ALMOST A DISASTER.

21:13.792 --> 21:15.750
HEY, GUYS.

21:15.750 --> 21:16.917
HELLO.
HEY.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.333
BUZZ.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.291
SO, UH,
WHERE'S JOEY?

21:19.291 --> 21:20.458
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
COMING WITH US.

21:20.458 --> 21:23.250
SHE, UH, WANTED TO STOP
BY THE LIBRARY FIRST

21:23.250 --> 21:26.000
AND PLOW
THROUGH THAT WATERGATE
HISTORY ASSIGNMENT.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.834
SO WE'RE AGREED?

21:35.917 --> 21:36.959
AGREED.

21:36.959 --> 21:38.333
OK.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.583
PACEY.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.291
RIGHT.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.375
YOU GO FIRST.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.792
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU LATER.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.333
Jack: HEY,
DON'T LOOK NOW,

22:07.333 --> 22:09.750
BUT I THINK
THAT'S THE CAPTAIN
OF THIS VESSEL.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.875
Andie: WELL, THEN
I GUESS WE CAN GET STARTED.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.083
NOT WITHOUT THIS,
WE CAN'T.

22:16.667 --> 22:18.959
AS PROMISED.

22:18.959 --> 22:21.834
WHOA! CHAMPAGNE.
HA HA.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.083
YOU KNOW, SPARKLING
APPLE CIDER

22:24.083 --> 22:25.667
WOULD HAVE WORKED
JUST AS WELL,
DAWSON.

22:25.667 --> 22:27.000
NOT FOR
THIS OCCASION, MAN.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.959
THIS IS A MONUMENTAL
ACCOMPLISHMENT.

22:28.959 --> 22:31.166
YOU TOOK SOMETHING
THAT WAS DESTINED
FOR THE SCRAP HEAP

22:31.166 --> 22:33.875
AND MANAGED TO TURN IT
NOT ONLY INTO
A THING OF BEAUTY,

22:33.875 --> 22:35.208
BUT ALSO A VIABLE
MODE OF TRANSPORTATION.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.500
WITTER,
COME ON, MAN.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.166
LET'S GET THE SHOW
ON THE ROAD.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.792
BE RIGHT THERE,
MAN.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.000
UH...

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
LOOK, DAWSON,
YOU GONNA BE HOME
AFTER ALL THIS?

22:44.000 --> 22:46.125
YEAH. FOR A LITTLE BIT.
I'VE GOT TO WORK LATER.

22:46.125 --> 22:48.166
COOL.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.417
UH...
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LOOK.

22:50.417 --> 22:51.458
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE
ALL ON TIGHT SCHEDULES,

22:51.458 --> 22:54.500
SO I'M GONNA
KEEP THIS THING SHORT.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.875
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY
AND ALL.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.375
HEY.

22:58.375 --> 22:58.792
HEY.

22:58.792 --> 23:01.208
UM...

23:01.208 --> 23:04.208
FIRST AND FOREMOST,
I SHOULD PROBABLY THANK
HURRICANE CHRIS

23:04.208 --> 23:07.750
FOR ENABLING A POOR SCHLUB
LIKE ME TO ACTUALLY BE ABLE
TO AFFORD A BOAT LIKE THIS.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.041
BUT, UH, SECONDLY
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,

23:10.041 --> 23:12.667
I'D LIKE TO THANK EVERYBODY
WHO PITCHED IN...

23:12.667 --> 23:17.083
EVERYBODY WHO SCRAPED
AND SANDED AND POLISHED
AND PAINTED

23:17.083 --> 23:20.542
AND OTHERWISE HELPED OUT
TO GET THIS BOAT
BACK IN THE WATER.

23:20.542 --> 23:22.875
SOME, OF COURSE, DID THAT
MORE WILLINGLY THAN OTHERS.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.583
SO, UH...

23:24.583 --> 23:26.542
WITHOUT FURTHER ADO...

23:26.542 --> 23:28.375
I CHRISTEN FOR YOU...

23:28.375 --> 23:30.500
TRUE LOVE.

23:53.959 --> 23:56.291
WILL?

23:56.291 --> 23:57.959
HEY.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.417
DAWSON, HEY.

24:00.417 --> 24:02.667
UM, LOOK, I WAS
WONDERIN' IF YOU
COULD HELP ME OUT.

24:02.667 --> 24:04.458
I'M LOOKIN'
FOR SOME SECRET ROOM

24:04.458 --> 24:05.041
ANDIE SAYS IS, LIKE,
IDEAL FOR STUDYING.

24:05.041 --> 24:07.500
UM...

24:07.500 --> 24:08.792
SHE PROBABLY MEANS
THE GENEALOGY ROOM.

24:08.792 --> 24:10.208
IT'S USUALLY
PRETTY DEAD IN THERE.

24:10.208 --> 24:11.750
COOL.
GUESS I'LL TRY THAT.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.458
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD LUCK.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.417
HEY, DAWSON.

24:16.417 --> 24:19.917
WHAT DID, UH,
YOU AND JOEY DO
ON YOUR FIRST DATE?

24:19.917 --> 24:22.458
EXCUSE ME?

24:22.458 --> 24:23.792
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO TELL ME--

24:23.792 --> 24:28.208
NO, IT'S FINE.
IT'S JUST--
I'M KIND OF SURPRISED.

24:28.208 --> 24:29.542
IT'S A LEFT FIELD
QUESTION.

24:29.542 --> 24:31.917
YEAH, BUT, UH,
NOT IF YOU JUST
ASKED SOMEONE OUT.

24:31.917 --> 24:34.792
ANDIE?

24:34.792 --> 24:36.208
YEAH.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.959
UM, SO,
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

24:38.959 --> 24:40.667
WELL, JOEY AND I
WENT TO THE MOVIES,

24:40.667 --> 24:42.625
WHICH IS A REALLY
TERRIBLE IDEA

24:42.625 --> 24:44.417
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
TALK TO THE PERSON.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.834
YOU CAN'T EVEN
REALLY LOOK AT 'EM.

24:45.834 --> 24:47.834
SO, WHAT WOULD
YOU SUGGEST?

24:47.834 --> 24:51.125
UM...THERE'S
ALWAYS THE CREEK.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.417
THE NIGHT SKY OVERHEAD,

24:52.417 --> 24:55.583
MOONLIGHT REFLECTED
IN THE WATER.

24:55.583 --> 24:57.959
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS
THAT'S ACHIEVED CLICHÉ STATUS

24:57.959 --> 24:58.834
'CAUSE IT ACTUALLY
IS THAT ROMANTIC.

24:58.834 --> 25:03.166
OH, UH, WHERE
WOULD I GET A BOAT?

25:03.166 --> 25:05.625
UH, MY HOUSE.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.166
YOU SURE?

25:07.166 --> 25:07.917
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS.

25:07.917 --> 25:09.792
JUST COME BY
AND GET IT.

25:09.792 --> 25:11.291
GREAT.

25:11.291 --> 25:12.542
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO TONIGHT?

25:12.542 --> 25:15.959
I THINK I MIGHT TRY
AND HOOK UP

25:15.959 --> 25:18.375
WITH AN OLD FRIEND.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.000
SO I'M REALLY
NOT ALLOWED
IN THE HOUSE?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.250
Jen: SORRY.

25:23.250 --> 25:26.083
ACCORDING TO GRAMS,
YOU'RE PUBLIC ENEMY
NUMBER ONE.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.917
WHAT IF I HAVE
TO USE THE BATHROOM?

25:28.917 --> 25:30.917
OR THE PHONE?

25:30.917 --> 25:33.291
WHAT IF
YOU START TO CHOKE

25:33.291 --> 25:35.417
AND I NEED
TO CALL 911?

25:35.417 --> 25:37.667
WELL, THEN WE'LL
JUST HAVE TO CONSULT

25:37.667 --> 25:40.792
AN ETIQUETTE BOOK
FROM 1955.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:43.792 --> 25:46.667
I DON'T KNOW. STUFF.

25:49.917 --> 25:52.542
YOU KNOW WHAT, HENRY?
WHY DON'T YOU GO INSIDE?

25:52.542 --> 25:54.375
YOU JUST TOLD ME
I COULDN'T.

25:54.375 --> 25:56.083
WELL, I CHANGED MY MIND.

25:57.375 --> 25:58.834
NO, I KNOW.
IT'S OK. GO.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.208
HEY.

26:01.208 --> 26:03.166
I'M SORRY.
I CAN COME BACK
IF IT'S A BAD TIME.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.375
OH, GOD, NO, NO.

26:05.375 --> 26:08.166
I WAS EXPECTING THAT
YOU'D COME BY ANYWAY.

26:11.667 --> 26:12.125
HOW YA DOIN'?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

26:12.125 --> 26:15.083
I'M FINE.

26:15.083 --> 26:16.625
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU WANNA
JUST COME INSIDE

26:16.625 --> 26:18.375
AND HANG OUT
WITH HENRY AND I...

26:18.375 --> 26:20.542
WE COULD USE
A CHAPERONE.

26:20.542 --> 26:23.708
AS TEMPTING
AS THAT SOUNDS,

26:23.708 --> 26:25.375
I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA GO WATCH A MOVIE,

26:25.375 --> 26:26.959
RELIVE BETTER DAYS.

26:26.959 --> 26:27.750
GOD...

26:27.750 --> 26:29.458
I KNOW
THIS MUST SEEM LIKE

26:29.458 --> 26:30.667
THE HARDEST THING
IN THE WORLD
RIGHT NOW,

26:30.667 --> 26:32.625
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IN THE LONG RUN,

26:32.625 --> 26:35.750
IT'S BETTER
THAT PACEY TOLD YOU.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.583
TOLD ME WHAT?

26:37.583 --> 26:40.667
T-TELL ME WHAT?

26:40.667 --> 26:44.417
THAT--NOTHING.

26:44.417 --> 26:47.291
IF IT'S NOTHING, THEN WHY
WERE YOU SO CONCERNED ABOUT ME?

26:47.291 --> 26:49.000
NO, I WASN'T CONCERNED.
YES, YOU WERE.

26:49.000 --> 26:51.583
YOU WERE CONCERNED
BECAUSE YOU ASSUMED
PACEY TOLD ME SOMETHING.

26:51.583 --> 26:52.750
TOLD ME WHAT, JEN?

26:54.333 --> 26:56.834
THE FACT THAT
YOU'RE UNWILLING TO ANSWER
MY QUESTION SPEAKS VOLUMES.

27:01.500 --> 27:01.834
IT HAS TO DO WITH JOEY,
DOESN'T IT?

27:08.083 --> 27:09.375
IT DOES, DOESN'T IT?

27:09.959 --> 27:11.542
GOD, I'M SO SORRY.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.959
YOU'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS?

27:13.959 --> 27:16.792
DAWSON,
IT WASN'T MY PLACE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

27:16.792 --> 27:19.875
I DIDN'T WANT
TO INTERFERE.

27:19.875 --> 27:22.625
I WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU.

27:23.917 --> 27:27.417
WAIT, DAWSON.
WAIT, STOP,
SAY SOMETHING.

27:27.417 --> 27:28.417
PLEASE.
I'M FINE,

27:28.417 --> 27:29.583
ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.125
I'M FINE.
NO, YOU ARE
NOT FINE.

27:31.125 --> 27:32.542
WHAT CAN I SAY?
WHAT CAN I DO?

27:32.542 --> 27:34.583
YOU CAN DO ME
THE SAME FAVOR
THAT YOU DID THEM.

27:34.583 --> 27:35.959
YOU CAN KEEP THIS
TO YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?

27:35.959 --> 27:38.667
THANKS FOR PROTECTING ME.

28:01.625 --> 28:02.750
JUST NEVER
THOUGHT YOU'D
DO ME THAT WAY.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.125
I THOUGHT WE WERE
STILL BEST FRIENDS.

28:04.125 --> 28:05.625
WE ARE.

28:05.625 --> 28:06.583
WHAT YOU SO MAD FOR?

28:06.583 --> 28:07.750
I NEVER DONE
NOTHIN' TO YOU.

28:07.750 --> 28:08.500
I GUESS SCREWIN'
MY GIRL AIN'T
NOTHIN' TO YOU.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.458
I AIN'T SCREWIN' HER.

28:10.458 --> 28:11.625
THE HELL YOU AIN'T.

28:11.625 --> 28:13.917
[RUSTLING AT WINDOW]

28:15.417 --> 28:16.417
HEY.

28:16.417 --> 28:18.000
YOU CHANGED
YOUR MIND.

28:18.000 --> 28:21.041
KIND OF.

28:21.041 --> 28:24.792
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU,
DAWSON, UM...

28:27.500 --> 28:28.208
PACEY'S NOT HERE, IS HE?

28:28.208 --> 28:30.500
UH, NO.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.917
IS HE SUPPOSED TO BE?

28:32.917 --> 28:33.875
NO.

28:37.708 --> 28:40.291
WHAT ARE YOU
WATCHING ANYWAY?

28:40.291 --> 28:42.542
THE LAST PICTURE SHOW.

28:45.708 --> 28:47.166
ISN'T THAT THE MOVIE
THAT WE SAW WHEN--

28:47.166 --> 28:48.542
OUR FIRST DATE.

28:48.542 --> 28:50.208
YEP.

28:50.208 --> 28:52.000
YES, IT IS.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.959
WASN'T EXACTLY
A SUCCESSFUL
EVENING, WAS IT?

28:55.959 --> 28:57.917
AT LEAST
NOT MOVIE-WISE.

28:57.917 --> 28:59.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

28:59.792 --> 29:01.834
WELL, WE NEVER
GOT TO SEE THE END.

29:08.875 --> 29:11.917
SO, UH, HOW
DOES IT END, DAWSON?

29:14.125 --> 29:16.875
WELL, IT'S 3 FRIENDS
THAT GREW UP
WITH EACH OTHER.

29:16.875 --> 29:18.750
JEFF BRIDGES IS IN LOVE
WITH CYBILL SHEPHERD,

29:18.750 --> 29:22.583
AND SHE DUMPS HIM
AND BREAKS HIS HEART.

29:22.583 --> 29:25.291
HE'S COMPLETELY
DEVASTATED...

29:25.291 --> 29:28.291
AND TURNS OUT SHE'S NOT.

29:28.291 --> 29:30.500
SHE JUST KIND OF MOVES
ON TO THE OTHER GUY,

29:30.500 --> 29:32.667
AND IT DESTROYS
THEIR FRIENDSHIP.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.792
IT'S NEVER THE SAME
AFTER THAT,

29:34.792 --> 29:37.542
AND THAT'S
HOW THE MOVIE ENDS.

29:37.542 --> 29:41.208
EVERYONE ALONE. EVERYONE
HATING EACH OTHER.

29:43.583 --> 29:45.333
IT'S PRETTY
DEPRESSING, ACTUALLY.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M WATCHING IT.

29:50.792 --> 29:54.458
SO WHAT WAS IT YOU
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT?

29:58.125 --> 29:59.125
YOU KNOW, I JUST,
I ACTUALLY--

29:59.125 --> 30:01.667
I JUST REMEMBERED
THAT I PROMISED BESSIE

30:01.667 --> 30:04.125
THAT I WOULD HELP
WATCH ALEXANDER TONIGHT,

30:04.125 --> 30:07.333
AND SHE'S PROBABLY
WAITING FOR ME, SO, UM...

30:10.291 --> 30:12.250
BYE.

30:25.625 --> 30:26.792
Pacey: YOU DIDN'T
COME HERE TO TELL HIM.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.583
YOU JUST
CAME HERE TO STOP ME
FROM TELLIN' HIM.

30:28.583 --> 30:30.125
LOOK, THAT'S
NOT TRUE, PACEY.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.083
I TRIED.
I TRIED TO TELL HIM.

30:31.083 --> 30:33.291
I WENT UP THERE,
AND I TRIED.

30:33.291 --> 30:34.625
OF COURSE YOU DID.
LET ME GUESS.

30:34.625 --> 30:37.083
YOU FAILED, RIGHT?

30:39.625 --> 30:41.542
Pacey: I'M SORRY, MAN.

30:41.542 --> 30:42.792
WE DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU THIS WAY.

30:42.792 --> 30:44.792
Dawson: YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

30:48.125 --> 30:50.291
YOU KNOW, DON'T YOU?

30:50.291 --> 30:51.834
YEAH, I KNOW.

30:54.458 --> 30:55.834
SO WERE YOU PLANNING
ON TELLING ME,

30:55.834 --> 30:56.959
OR WAS THIS JUST
GONNA BE A SECRET FLING?

30:56.959 --> 30:58.166
LOOK,
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.250
THEN HOW WAS IT? 'CAUSE
JEN WAS SHORT ON DETAILS.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.250
SHE TOLD YOU?

31:01.250 --> 31:02.500
WELL, SHE THOUGHT
I KNEW. I MEAN...

31:02.500 --> 31:05.667
I HAD TO BE PRETTY FRICKIN'
STUPID NOT TO KNOW, RIGHT?

31:05.667 --> 31:07.000
THAT THE 2 PEOPLE
I TRUSTED MOST IN THE WORLD

31:07.000 --> 31:08.625
WERE LYING TO ME?

31:10.291 --> 31:13.667
SO ARE YOU BORED? ARE YOU
CONFUSED OR JUST MALICIOUS?

31:13.667 --> 31:15.834
HEY, LOOK, I STARTED
THIS THING, OK?

31:15.834 --> 31:16.625
IF YOU'RE GONNA
GET ANGRY AT SOMEBODY,

31:16.625 --> 31:18.583
YOU GET ANGRY AT ME.

31:18.583 --> 31:19.959
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE IN ANY POSITION

31:19.959 --> 31:21.417
TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT'S FAIR.

31:21.417 --> 31:23.166
YOU WERE MY BEST FRIEND.

31:23.166 --> 31:24.542
I STILL AM.

31:24.542 --> 31:26.750
I'M FINDING THAT A LITTLE HARD
TO PROCESS RIGHT NOW.

31:26.750 --> 31:29.458
IT'S THE TRUTH, DAWSON.

31:29.458 --> 31:30.500
SO I GUESS
IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME

31:30.500 --> 31:31.792
THAT FRIENDSHIP
DOESN'T COME ABOVE SEX

31:31.792 --> 31:33.166
IN YOUR LIST
OF PERSONAL PRIORITIES.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.542
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH SEX.

31:34.542 --> 31:35.166
OH, WHAT,
ARE YOU IN LOVE?

31:35.166 --> 31:38.417
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

31:38.417 --> 31:40.208
OH, GOD, DON'T LOOK. DON'T
LOOK AT HER, ALL RIGHT?

31:40.208 --> 31:41.291
DON'T. I--

31:41.291 --> 31:42.792
YOU KNOW WHAT, PACEY?
I FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.

31:42.792 --> 31:44.041
BECAUSE WHEN
ALL THIS IS OVER,

31:44.041 --> 31:45.792
YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
NEED YOUR FRIENDS,

31:45.792 --> 31:46.875
AND YOU'RE NOT
GONNA HAVE ANY.

31:46.875 --> 31:49.542
YOU ARE NOT GONNA
HAVE A SINGLE ONE.

31:51.417 --> 31:52.875
Andie: HEY, GUYS.
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

31:52.875 --> 31:56.667
Dawson: WHY DON'T
YOU ASK PACEY?

31:56.667 --> 31:57.667
ASK HIM
HOW LONG HE AND JOEY

31:57.667 --> 31:59.000
HAVE BEEN SNEAKIN'
AROUND BEHIND MY BACK,

31:59.000 --> 31:59.959
OR BETTER YET,
ASK JOEY.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.834
ASK HER HOW LONG
SHE'S BEEN LYING

32:01.834 --> 32:02.875
TO ME AND TO YOU.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.166
GO AHEAD, ASK 'EM

32:04.166 --> 32:07.125
BECAUSE I CAN'T STAND
TO LOOK AT 'EM ANYMORE.

32:13.667 --> 32:14.375
WAIT, DAWSON.
DAWSON, WAIT, STOP.

32:14.375 --> 32:15.041
SAY SOMETHING,
PLEASE.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.708
I'M FINE,
ALL RIGHT.

32:16.708 --> 32:18.417
I'M FINE.
I'M FINE.

32:18.417 --> 32:19.625
NO, YOU ARE
NOT FINE.

32:19.625 --> 32:20.792
WHAT CAN I SAY?
WHAT CAN I DO?

32:20.792 --> 32:23.417
YOU CAN
DO ME THE SAME FAVOR
THAT YOU DID THEM.

32:23.417 --> 32:24.667
YOU CAN KEEP THIS
TO YOURSELF, ALL RIGHT?

32:24.667 --> 32:26.625
THANKS FOR PROTECTING ME.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.458
SO,
WHERE WERE WE?

32:44.458 --> 32:46.542
HENRY, I JUST DID
THE MOST AWFUL THING.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.792
IT COULDN'T HAVE
BEEN THAT AWFUL.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.458
BELIEVE ME, IT WAS.

32:51.458 --> 32:53.542
GOD, I TOTALLY
SCREWED UP.

32:53.542 --> 32:58.417
I ACCIDENTALLY
TOLD DAWSON SOMETHING
HE WASN'T SUPPOSED TO KNOW

32:58.417 --> 33:02.291
AND REALLY
HURT HIS FEELINGS
IN THE PROCESS.

33:02.291 --> 33:04.708
BUT YOU DIDN'T
MEAN TO DO IT.

33:04.708 --> 33:06.875
YEAH, BUT
IT'S STILL MY FAULT.

33:06.875 --> 33:09.542
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE
WHO MESSED UP.

33:09.542 --> 33:11.792
HEY, NO.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.333
I'M NOT SURE
WHAT IT IS THAT
YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW,

33:13.333 --> 33:14.583
BUT IT'S NOT
HELPING MATTERS ANY.

33:14.583 --> 33:16.291
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT GIVING IT A CHANCE.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.875
I MEAN IT.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.959
LOOK, I'M JUST TRYING
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

33:21.959 --> 33:24.333
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE
YOURSELF FEEL BETTER.

33:24.333 --> 33:27.208
WHAT DID I DO
THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE?

33:28.875 --> 33:29.667
DON'T YOU
EVEN WANT TO KNOW
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

33:29.667 --> 33:32.625
MAYBE I DON'T.

33:32.625 --> 33:34.417
MAYBE FOR ONCE
I WANT TO PUT US

33:34.417 --> 33:36.000
BEFORE WHATEVER
LITTLE MINI-DRAMA

33:36.000 --> 33:38.333
YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE WHIPPED UP
THIS WEEK.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.792
OK.

33:40.792 --> 33:43.083
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE?

33:43.083 --> 33:45.041
I'M NOT KIDDING.
LEAVE.

33:45.041 --> 33:45.917
NOW YOU'RE
BEING IRRATIONAL.

33:45.917 --> 33:48.792
NO. NO,
JUST IRRITATED.

33:48.792 --> 33:50.458
IRRATIONAL IS
WHEN I GET VIOLENT,

33:50.458 --> 33:51.750
WHICH IS GONNA
HAPPEN IN 2 SECONDS

33:51.750 --> 33:53.291
IF YOU DON'T
GET YOUR HORNY
FRESHMAN ASS OUT OF HERE.

34:06.375 --> 34:08.875
Will: A LITTLE MUCH MAYBE,
FOR A FIRST DATE?

34:08.875 --> 34:10.708
Andie: NO. NO,
I MEAN, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.875
COME ON, ADMIT IT.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.708
I DID KIND OF GO...

34:14.708 --> 34:17.000
OVERBOARD?

34:18.708 --> 34:21.833
PLAN B.

34:21.833 --> 34:23.333
PRETEND
WE'RE NOT ON A DATE.

34:23.333 --> 34:24.375
OK.

34:24.375 --> 34:28.166
UM, YOU'RE ROWING US
ACROSS A BODY OF WATER.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.542
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO PRETEND?

34:30.542 --> 34:32.917
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING
FROM GREEK MYTHOLOGY?

34:32.917 --> 34:34.833
ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.

34:34.833 --> 34:36.708
DO YOU KNOW THAT ONE?

34:36.708 --> 34:37.833
UH-UH.

34:37.833 --> 34:40.208
THEY WERE A COUPLE OF KIDS,
TOTALLY IN LOVE,

34:40.208 --> 34:42.166
BUT THEN SHE DIED.

34:42.166 --> 34:43.708
SNAKE BITE.

34:43.708 --> 34:46.333
HE COULDN'T DEAL,

34:46.333 --> 34:48.875
SO BEING THE ANCIENT WORLD'S
MOST KICK-ASS MUSICIAN,

34:48.875 --> 34:50.583
HE GOES TO THE UNDERWORLD,

34:50.583 --> 34:53.833
LOCATED
THE PROPER AUTHORITIES
AND PLAYED FOR 'EM...

34:53.833 --> 34:57.708
ALL ABOUT EURYDICE AND HOW
HE HAD TO HAVE HER BACK.

34:59.500 --> 35:01.959
AND? WHAT HAPPENS?

35:01.959 --> 35:04.125
IT WORKED...

35:04.125 --> 35:06.041
BUT THERE WAS
ONE CONDITION.

35:06.041 --> 35:09.333
HE WASN'T ALLOWED
TO LOOK AT HER

35:09.333 --> 35:11.542
UNTIL THEY WERE BACK
IN THE REAL WORLD,

35:11.542 --> 35:13.667
SO THEY SET OUT,

35:13.667 --> 35:15.750
AND AS THEY WERE
JUST ABOUT TO MAKE IT,

35:15.750 --> 35:17.708
HE LOOKED BACK.

35:17.708 --> 35:19.959
SO, SHE DIED
ALL OVER AGAIN?

35:19.959 --> 35:24.000
HE WENT TO GRAB FOR HER,

35:24.000 --> 35:27.458
AND ALL HE GOT WAS AIR.

35:31.291 --> 35:32.792
Andie: HEY, GUYS.

35:32.792 --> 35:33.458
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

35:36.333 --> 35:37.125
WHY DON'T YOU
ASK PACEY?

35:37.125 --> 35:39.458
ASK HIM
HOW LONG HE AND JOEY

35:39.458 --> 35:40.834
HAVE BEEN SNEAKING
AROUND BEHIND MY BACK,

35:40.834 --> 35:41.792
OR BETTER YET,
ASK JOEY.

35:41.792 --> 35:42.792
ASK HER HOW LONG
THE TWO OF THEM

35:42.792 --> 35:44.000
HAVE BEEN LYING
TO YOU AND TO ME.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.708
GO AHEAD, ASK 'EM

35:45.708 --> 35:49.458
'CAUSE I CAN'T EVEN
STAND TO LOOK AT 'EM
ANYMORE.

35:56.834 --> 35:59.291
SO, IS THIS TRUE,
PACEY?

35:59.291 --> 36:01.667
YOU AND JOEY?

36:03.792 --> 36:04.959
YES.

36:04.959 --> 36:10.125
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

36:10.125 --> 36:13.834
ME NEITHER.

36:13.834 --> 36:15.834
YOU MUST REALLY,
UH...

36:15.834 --> 36:17.959
YOU KNOW, TO GIVE UP
YOUR FRIENDSHIP
WITH DAWSON,

36:17.959 --> 36:20.834
TO GIVE UP
EVERYTHING.

36:23.500 --> 36:26.875
GOD, HOW COULD YOU
BE SO STUPID, PACEY?

36:29.708 --> 36:31.208
YOU KNOW YOU'RE
GONNA GET HURT.

36:31.208 --> 36:34.000
SHE IS NEVER
GOING TO LOVE YOU

36:34.000 --> 36:35.959
LIKE
SHE LOVES HIM, OK?

36:35.959 --> 36:37.667
HE IS HER
FIRST LOVE, PACEY.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.500
HER FIRST LOVE.

37:02.417 --> 37:03.667
Joey: LOOK, I DIDN'T
INTEND FOR THIS
TO HAPPEN, DAWSON.

37:03.667 --> 37:08.542
WHAT YOU INTENDED
DOES NOT PROVIDE ME
ANY SOLACE.

37:08.542 --> 37:10.458
WHAT?
DO YOU LOVE HIM?

37:10.458 --> 37:11.834
ARE YOU--
YOU JUST WANT
TO SLEEP WITH HIM?

37:11.834 --> 37:12.834
NO. HOW COULD
YOU SAY THAT?

37:12.834 --> 37:13.834
IT'S WHAT
HE'S GONNA EXPECT.

37:13.834 --> 37:16.417
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER,
DAWSON,

37:16.417 --> 37:18.500
AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN
FOR A LONG TIME.

37:18.500 --> 37:19.542
ALMOST
A WHOLE YEAR HAS--

37:19.542 --> 37:20.750
ARE YOU PUNISHING ME?

37:20.750 --> 37:22.333
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT TO GET BACK
TOGETHER WITH YOU?

37:22.333 --> 37:23.792
WHY WOULD YOU THINK
THAT I WOULD--

37:23.792 --> 37:25.542
WHY, JOEY? BECAUSE
YOU KEEP ON SAYING

37:25.542 --> 37:27.375
THAT YOU WANT
TO GO FIND YOURSELF.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.375
IS THIS WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR
THE WHOLE TIME?

37:29.375 --> 37:31.041
IS PACEY WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN LOOKING FOR?
NO.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.083
THEN EXPLAIN IT
TO ME, JOEY.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.542
EXPLAIN TO ME HOW
2 PEOPLE WHO CAN BARELY

37:34.542 --> 37:36.625
STAND TO BE IN THE
SAME ROOM WITH EACH OTHER

37:36.625 --> 37:37.917
END UP OUTSIDE MY WINDOW

37:37.917 --> 37:39.708
ARGUING ABOUT THE FUTURE
OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

37:39.708 --> 37:40.917
I CAN'T, OK?

37:40.917 --> 37:43.166
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
IT HAPPENED.

37:45.250 --> 37:49.291
EVERYTHING
BETWEEN YOU AND ME
IS SO COMPLICATED.

37:49.291 --> 37:52.166
JOEY, IF THINGS ARE
COMPLICATED BETWEEN US,

37:52.166 --> 37:54.250
IT'S BECAUSE YOU
MADE THEM THAT WAY,
ALL RIGHT? YOU.

37:54.250 --> 37:55.250
AND YOU THINK THAT...

37:55.250 --> 37:56.542
WHATEVER WAS WRONG
WHEN YOU WERE WITH ME

37:56.542 --> 37:58.083
IS GONNA
MAGICALLY GET BETTER
WHEN YOU'RE WITH HIM?

37:58.083 --> 38:00.375
I DON'T KNOW,
DAWSON.

38:00.375 --> 38:02.834
I DON'T KNOW, OK?

38:02.834 --> 38:06.667
I JUST KNOW THAT I--
I NEED HIM.

38:06.667 --> 38:08.208
YOU NEED HIM
LIKE YOU NEED ME?

38:09.708 --> 38:10.708
JOEY, IT'S
A SIMPLE QUESTION.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.291
DO YOU NEED HIM
LIKE YOU NEED ME?

38:12.291 --> 38:15.792
NO. LOOK, YOU CAN'T
DO THAT, DAWSON.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.250
YOU CAN'T.

38:17.250 --> 38:18.667
THOSE 2 THINGS
HAVE NOTHING TO DO

38:18.667 --> 38:19.959
WITH EACH OTHER,
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

38:19.959 --> 38:21.291
THE WAY THAT
I FEEL ABOUT HIM IS
COMPLETELY SEPARATE

38:21.291 --> 38:23.583
FROM THE WAY THAT
I FEEL ABOUT YOU

38:23.583 --> 38:24.667
AND OUR FRIENDSHIP.

38:24.667 --> 38:25.875
FRIENDSHIP, JOEY?

38:25.875 --> 38:27.625
RIGHT NOW, WE DON'T
HAVE A FRIENDSHIP.
WHAT?

38:27.625 --> 38:30.125
AS OF THIS MOMENT,
WE DO NOT HAVE A FRIENDSHIP!

38:30.125 --> 38:32.083
THAT IS NOT FAIR!

38:32.083 --> 38:33.041
YOU CAN'T
HAVE BOTH OF US!

38:33.041 --> 38:33.959
YOU CAN'T HAVE HIM
AS YOUR BOYFRIEND

38:33.959 --> 38:35.250
AND ME AS
YOUR CONSOLATION PRIZE.

38:35.250 --> 38:36.333
YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE,

38:36.333 --> 38:38.291
AND I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
IF YOU CHOOSE HIM,

38:38.291 --> 38:39.458
I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND
TO PICK UP THE PIECES

38:39.458 --> 38:41.750
WHEN IT ALL FALLS APART.

38:41.750 --> 38:43.458
THIS RUINS EVERYTHING.

38:43.458 --> 38:46.125
THERE'S NO GOIN' BACK.

38:46.125 --> 38:48.583
OK.

38:48.583 --> 38:49.959
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, DAWSON?

38:49.959 --> 38:51.250
TELL ME WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

38:51.250 --> 38:52.458
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO HEAR?

38:52.458 --> 38:54.959
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SAY ANYTHING.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.458
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.083
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

39:22.083 --> 39:23.834
HELL OF A DAY, HUH?

39:23.834 --> 39:25.166
I HAVE NO DESIRE
TO REWIND AND LIVE IT AGAIN,

39:25.166 --> 39:27.667
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

39:27.667 --> 39:30.500
YOU SHOULDN'T
BE ALONE RIGHT NOW.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.834
WHY NOT? I AM ALONE.

39:31.834 --> 39:33.291
I MIGHT AS WELL
GET USED TO IT.

39:33.291 --> 39:37.291
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, DAWSON.
DON'T EVER THINK THAT.

39:39.208 --> 39:42.208
JEN, WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL ME?

39:45.834 --> 39:50.083
IF 2 PEOPLE ARE
ON A CRASH COURSE
FOR EACH OTHER

39:50.083 --> 39:54.834
AND YOU THROW YOURSELF
IN BETWEEN...

39:54.834 --> 39:57.500
IT'S ONLY
GONNA BRING THEM
ALL THAT MUCH CLOSER.

40:00.250 --> 40:02.542
SO, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

40:02.542 --> 40:04.875
AM I SUPPOSED
TO JUST ACCEPT THIS?

40:04.875 --> 40:10.708
AM I SUPPOSED TO
JUST WAKE UP TOMORROW
LIKE NOTHING'S CHANGED?

40:10.708 --> 40:15.458
YOU JUST HAVE
TO LET THINGS
RUN THEIR COURSE,

40:15.458 --> 40:17.583
AND YOU HAVE
TO LET HER DECIDE

40:17.583 --> 40:19.542
WHAT IT IS THAT
SHE REALLY WANTS.

40:23.417 --> 40:25.542
I CAN'T LET HER GO.

40:25.542 --> 40:29.583
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO?

40:29.583 --> 40:31.375
YOU CAN FIGHT.

40:31.375 --> 40:35.291
YOU CAN FIGHT
FOR WHAT YOU WANT.

41:16.458 --> 41:17.583
EVER HAVE
ONE OF THOSE DAYS

41:17.583 --> 41:21.333
YOU WISH YOU COULD
LIVE ALL OVER AGAIN?

41:23.708 --> 41:25.959
YEAH.

41:25.959 --> 41:28.458
YOU?

41:28.458 --> 41:30.959
YEAH.

41:30.959 --> 41:34.875
SO, WHAT WOULD YOU
HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY?

41:34.875 --> 41:36.708
I DON'T KNOW.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.500
EVERYTHING.

41:43.583 --> 41:47.125
NOTHING AT ALL.

41:47.125 --> 41:50.041
WE'D STILL END UP
RIGHT BACK HERE,

41:53.458 --> 41:57.041
AND I DON'T
THINK I KNOW
WHERE HERE IS.

41:59.375 --> 42:03.125
HERE IS RIGHT
WHERE WE STARTED.

42:12.625 --> 42:15.083
WELL, SHE LOOKS
BEAUTIFUL IN THE WATER.

42:15.083 --> 42:18.500
Pacey: THIS MORNING WAS
REALLY JUST A FORMALITY.

42:18.500 --> 42:21.667
I STILL DON'T KNOW
IF SHE'S SEA-WORTHY.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.458
SHE LOOKS
PRETTY SOLID.

42:25.458 --> 42:27.375
I DON'T KNOW.

42:29.708 --> 42:32.750
I THINK I SEE SOME
STORMY WEATHER AHEAD.

42:39.083 --> 42:40.458
PACEY...

42:47.375 --> 42:48.708
IT'S OVER, ISN'T IT?

42:52.083 --> 42:56.041
IT HAS TO BE.

43:00.750 --> 43:03.375
MAYBE YOU SHOULD BE
THE FIRST ONE TO GO THIS TIME.
