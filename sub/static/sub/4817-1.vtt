00:35.660 --> 00:39.496
# Hey, Mister Tambourine Man #

00:39.664 --> 00:42.541
# Play a song for me #

00:42.709 --> 00:46.587
- # In the jingle-jangle morning... #
- "B."

00:46.755 --> 00:49.965
- # I'll come following... #
- "A."

00:50.133 --> 00:51.884
You having fun, sweetheart?

00:52.052 --> 00:54.053
Yes.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.847
Ahh.

00:57.015 --> 00:59.850
Well, I hope you're doing
better than me, baby.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.436
- What are you making?
- A necklace for Mom.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.688
Yeah? Let me see.

01:04.855 --> 01:07.066
Wow. Another one?

01:07.233 --> 01:09.693
- Yes.
- Honey?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.528
That's two today.

01:11.696 --> 01:13.405
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.990
Honey?

01:15.158 --> 01:17.785
- Yeah?
- Waiting for the help to get that?

01:17.952 --> 01:20.704
I thought you and I were the help.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.793
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.420
Mmm, smells nice.
That takeout?

01:30.048 --> 01:31.965
Mommy, look at-

01:40.100 --> 01:41.850
No!

01:42.018 --> 01:44.353
No! Ahh!

01:47.315 --> 01:52.027
Oh! No no no!

01:52.195 --> 01:54.655
You can't fight fate.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.252
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

02:09.419 --> 02:13.882
Oh! Oh no!

02:16.928 --> 02:19.304
No!

02:19.472 --> 02:22.182
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

02:22.350 --> 02:24.643
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

02:24.811 --> 02:26.812
Just shut the fuck up!

02:33.194 --> 02:35.154
No!

02:42.996 --> 02:45.664
It's cool.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.332
Kids like me.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.502
No! Heather!

02:53.256 --> 02:56.049
No no!

03:51.814 --> 03:54.691
- Nick.
- Bray, what's happenin'?

03:54.859 --> 03:58.111
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.
Where are we on his kid's case?

03:58.279 --> 03:59.696
- Willis?
- Yeah.

03:59.864 --> 04:01.615
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
- Why did you do that?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.700
'Cause the case was a dog.
The kid was only 15 years old

04:03.868 --> 04:05.494
when he committed the murder.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.497
You wouldn't want to jeopardize
your 95% conviction rate.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.624
- It's actually 96%.
- 96% now?

04:10.792 --> 04:13.126
Yes. You gotta keep your books
better than that.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.673
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were gunning for my job.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.298
You do know better.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.802
And you know that I'm aiming
much higher than that.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.513
They filed a motion to dismiss,

04:24.681 --> 04:26.515
but there's no way that
Judge Abrams honors it.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.891
I think that we can
get him on RICO.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.560
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

04:30.728 --> 04:33.563
You might want to reevaluate
your research skills.

04:33.731 --> 04:35.565
- What else have we got?
- She's right.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.858
Mr. Rice?

04:37.026 --> 04:38.485
RICO's designed
for this kind of thing.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.071
Check out section 901 of
the Organized Crime Control Act.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.448
And you should let Sarah
try this case too.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.618
Mr. Rice, last I checked,
I was running this room.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.121
She's already done the leg-work.
I'll oversee it.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.081
I mean, Helen Keller
could try this case.

04:52.542 --> 04:55.836
Okay, Boy Wonder,
she fucks up, it's on you.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.927
Cantrell wants to see you.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.387
All right, I'll be right there.

05:05.555 --> 05:09.057
No, Nick.
He wants to see Nick.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.768
You still torturing Bringham?

05:11.936 --> 05:14.146
Let's just say I'm less impressed
with his Harvard degree than he is.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.647
Well, we can't all have
gone to Fordham.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.065
I went to Fordham night school.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.443
You know what I learned
in Fordham night school?

05:19.610 --> 05:20.902
Law school's got nothing
to do with law.

05:21.070 --> 05:23.322
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.241
All I need is a jury to like me.
Isn't that what you told me, Jonas?

05:26.409 --> 05:29.286
The Shelton case-
where are we?

05:29.454 --> 05:31.163
It went sideways last night-
Judge Burch.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.706
Ahh.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.666
Bad news. What now?

05:34.834 --> 05:37.544
- Let's make the deal.
- They killed a little girl, Nick.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.589
- It's an imperfect system.
- And we its imperfect servants.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.343
- However you could win this case.
- No, can't take that chance.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.137
Some justice is better
than no justice at all.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.306
You need to tell the husband.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.683
Okay.
That's part of my job.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.811
Good, because he's waiting
for you right now.

05:54.979 --> 05:56.646
What?

06:05.948 --> 06:08.825
- How are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

06:08.993 --> 06:11.578
Good. Sit. Sit.

06:11.746 --> 06:14.247
Well, I didn't hear back from you

06:14.415 --> 06:17.584
and made some notes
on the case.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.670
I had some good ideas.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.506
Yeah, let me
take a look at it.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.884
Well, they're just-

06:29.889 --> 06:33.517
I was gonna talk to you
about those.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.895
Do you trust me?

06:39.732 --> 06:41.942
Do you trust me, Clyde?

06:43.444 --> 06:44.694
Yeah, of course.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.575
Darby has agreed to testify
against Ames.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.328
With Darby's testimony,

06:53.496 --> 06:55.288
Ames will go
to death row.

06:59.585 --> 07:03.296
Um, what about-
what about Darby then?

07:03.464 --> 07:06.967
Darby will plead
guilty to murder.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.803
- In what degree?
- Third.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.431
He serves, what?
Five years...

07:12.598 --> 07:15.183
at best?

07:15.351 --> 07:18.228
I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

07:18.396 --> 07:22.232
We had a setback. The judge ruled
that the DNA was inadmissible.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.360
- What?
- Exclusionary rule.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.362
The opposing counsel
maneuvered it.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.698
You said this part of
the case was clear-cut.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.366
We had the blood on his shirt-

07:31.534 --> 07:33.201
It's covered under
the same rule.

07:33.369 --> 07:34.703
What about the rest of
the forensic evidence?

07:34.871 --> 07:38.498
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

07:40.501 --> 07:44.087
Okay, that's okay.
'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.299
I saw them do it.
I mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.343
You blacked out, Clyde.
Your testimony won't be reliable.

07:50.511 --> 07:53.263
You get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.849
No no, the jury's gonna
believe me though.

07:56.017 --> 07:59.144
- Because it's the truth! We can-
- We can lose.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.063
And then we'd have nothing.

08:02.231 --> 08:04.608
You will waste a whole year,
spend millions of dollars,

08:04.775 --> 08:06.693
and then both of them could
end up going free.

08:06.861 --> 08:10.405
Nick, both of them are guilty,
especially Darby!

08:10.573 --> 08:12.574
- You know that.
- It's not what you know, Clyde.

08:12.742 --> 08:15.160
It's what you can
prove in court.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.416
Please don't make a deal
with this man.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.627
Please don't make a deal with this man.
He's a monster-

08:23.794 --> 08:26.296
I'm sorry, the deal is done.
I'm sorry.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.298
I made the deal.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.426
What?
How could you do that?

08:31.594 --> 08:35.179
This is just how
the justice system works.

08:35.347 --> 08:39.433
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

08:39.602 --> 08:42.354
but this is a victory for us.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.276
Your office has certified
this agreement?

08:48.444 --> 08:49.694
Yes, Your Honor.

08:49.862 --> 08:53.740
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights
to share with the court today?

08:53.908 --> 08:56.910
I'm a defense attorney, Your Honor.
I don't have many of those.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.166
No, Your Honor.
No insights.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.127
Good, then I trust that we can
move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

09:06.295 --> 09:09.798
unimpeded by continuances.
A triaI date is imminent.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.761
Yeah?

09:14.929 --> 09:17.305
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

09:17.473 --> 09:18.807
- We've been over this-
- I'm sorry.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.100
- and over this, over this...

09:20.268 --> 09:22.936
Yeah, I had some
exigent business I-

09:23.104 --> 09:25.063
Next time it's mine.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.736
- Ah, you married?
- Excuse me?

09:31.904 --> 09:33.905
Are you married?

09:35.116 --> 09:39.035
Please fuck this up
so I can destroy you.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.876
I wish ill for no man,

09:47.044 --> 09:50.714
but Ames deserves to
suffer for what he did.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.050
I mean, you can't
fight fate, right?

10:00.057 --> 10:01.266
Nick.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.019
Once you make a decision,
live with it- move on.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.354
This job, your best asset's
a short memory.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.566
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other
people out there doing that already.

10:09.734 --> 10:10.984
Look, there's some of them
right now.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.112
Isn't this where you tell me
some type of old fable

10:14.280 --> 10:17.073
or wives' tale-

10:17.241 --> 10:19.075
All right, all right, I got one.

10:19.243 --> 10:21.161
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant
to walk behind him

10:21.329 --> 10:22.912
as he made his way through
the Roman town square.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.165
And this servant's only job

10:25.333 --> 10:28.001
was to whisper in his ear
when people praised him,

10:28.169 --> 10:31.463
"You're only a man.
You're only a man."

10:31.631 --> 10:33.048
- Okay, man?
- Okay, man.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.466
- Okay, man.
- That's some bullshit.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.634
That's good.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.093
I don't think you even know
what that story means.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.387
You're missing the point, Nick.
It doesn't matter what they say.

10:39.555 --> 10:41.056
Okay, I got this now.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.853
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
one at a time, one at a time.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.772
So you'll be seeking
the death penalty?

10:48.939 --> 10:50.940
- For Rupert Ames, we will be.
- And for Darby?

10:51.108 --> 10:53.610
He has pled guilty to murder,
but he is a cooperating witness.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.154
The DA's office has committed
all of its resources

10:56.322 --> 10:58.823
to ensure that justice
will be served.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.659
Did you make any kind of-

11:00.826 --> 11:02.577
Do you think this is
a fair sentence for Darby?

11:05.498 --> 11:09.125
I just wanted to say
thanks for being in my corner.

11:09.293 --> 11:12.295
It's nice when
the system works, right?

11:12.463 --> 11:14.589
Get away from me.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.092
Move. Move.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.349
Let's go.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.298
- Nick?
- Hey.

12:09.937 --> 12:12.105
Nuh-uh, what happened?

12:12.273 --> 12:14.524
What happened to what?

12:15.735 --> 12:17.861
What's wrong?

12:18.863 --> 12:22.198
You call my job boring. "C-"?

12:22.366 --> 12:23.908
Yes.

12:25.035 --> 12:28.163
Well...
okay now...

12:28.330 --> 12:30.206
you gonna tell me
what's wrong?

12:30.374 --> 12:33.918
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

12:34.086 --> 12:37.046
- Oh, please. No no no.
- Gonna lay down.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.549
Please?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.843
First of all,
this is your father speaking.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.720
- Yeah, she didn't know that.
- You never know.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.681
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.017
'cause there's a lot
of crazy-ass people out here.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.935
Language.

12:51.103 --> 12:54.147
Your mother's a hardass, but-

12:54.315 --> 12:55.565
I'm right here.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.319
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to
come out and be Daddy's little girl.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.155
I want her to come out
'cause she's on my bladder.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.157
Ahh!

13:05.576 --> 13:07.786
Anybody seen my phone?

13:12.041 --> 13:15.502
- Hey, have you seen my phone?
- It's not strapped to your hand?

13:15.669 --> 13:17.629
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.506
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

13:19.673 --> 13:21.132
You're not gonna have
some of my French toast?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.051
- French toast? You made French toast?
- Mm-hmm.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.095
I can't, honey.
I'm running late.

13:26.263 --> 13:27.514
Okay.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.767
All right, here- Mmm.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.560
- Mmm, that's good.
- Thank you.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.770
- You did this by yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.647
I'm just gonna take
this whole plate to work.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.274
All right- no.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.109
You're only 10 years old?

13:40.277 --> 13:42.278
- You better than your mother.
- I heard that.

13:42.446 --> 13:45.031
Smells good in here.
Your lifeline.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.033
'Morning, baby.
Give me a kiss.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.245
Mmm! You going to your daughter's
recitaI this afternoon?

13:51.831 --> 13:55.124
Um, I thought you were gonna
order the DVDs.

13:55.292 --> 13:56.960
Video's not the same, Nick.

13:57.127 --> 14:00.129
Mom, it's okay.
Dad's got to work, I know.

14:00.297 --> 14:03.174
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work.
And what is Dad doing today?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.009
- Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.511
- To keep us safe.
- Yeah.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.597
She understands.
'Cause he wants us to be safe.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.558
- Baby, get your cello.
- All right.

14:11.725 --> 14:13.768
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.813
- Little Julia Child.
- Mmm.

14:18.107 --> 14:20.525
You know she's
10 years old, right?

14:20.693 --> 14:21.943
- You know that?
- I know that.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.653
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.822
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff-
that's just talk to her.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.657
Don't do this, come on.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.534
I can't come today.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.870
You know you have not been
to one recitaI-

14:32.037 --> 14:33.621
- How many has she had?
- Enough.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.124
Okay.
Well, we'll get the video,

14:36.292 --> 14:40.420
we'll sit down and we'll
watch it together as a family.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.714
I love you.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.173
All right?

14:44.341 --> 14:46.426
- Thank you for the toast.
- Love you.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.719
- Love you too!
- Bye.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.804
Love you.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.848
Huh.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.767
- So how's Chip?
- It's Chester.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.311
What happened to Chip?
I liked Chip.

14:56.478 --> 14:58.104
There is no Chip.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.648
And now there's no Chester.
He kept calling.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.151
- Sarah, that's a good thing.
- I know, but I kept cancelling.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.153
My caseload's crazy.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.989
You know you don't have to
go to this if you don't want to.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.700
Yeah, I do. I...

15:10.868 --> 15:12.285
What's it like?

15:12.453 --> 15:14.746
No biggie.
Like watching somebody fall asleep.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.915
Except for
the not-waking-up part.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.917
Does it bother you?

15:19.084 --> 15:20.668
Not anymore.

16:05.756 --> 16:09.759
Sarah, your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

16:09.927 --> 16:13.012
Fuck off.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.807
What are you doing here, Reynolds?
Your DVD player broken?

16:15.975 --> 16:19.394
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.980
Wow, that's nice.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.151
Breathe.

16:44.336 --> 16:47.797
Rupert Ames, do you have
anything you want to say?

16:48.799 --> 16:50.925
Yeah.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.343
Uh-huh.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.141
What I did that night was wrong.

16:59.226 --> 17:02.061
I should have never been there.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.858
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill those people.

17:10.945 --> 17:13.448
The wrong man's dying here today.

17:17.118 --> 17:19.746
The wrong man's dying.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.998
That's all.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.483
Look at me.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.819
Look at me!

18:51.755 --> 18:55.716
Ahh! Fuck!

18:57.261 --> 18:59.262
Fuck!

18:59.429 --> 19:02.431
Ahh! Fuck!

19:02.599 --> 19:04.225
Oh, God.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.728
- Oh, God.
- Take her- take her out.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.106
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

19:12.109 --> 19:15.403
Ahhh!

19:40.637 --> 19:43.764
What could have caused
the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

19:43.932 --> 19:45.933
We'll keep you informed.

19:46.101 --> 19:48.352
You okay? Huh?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.188
Yeah.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.150
So somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill?

19:54.318 --> 19:55.568
What are we calling this?

19:55.736 --> 19:57.361
Clear violation of his
Eighth Amendment rights-

19:57.529 --> 19:59.322
- cruel and unusual punishment.
- Law schooI.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.699
Yeah. The machine-
how does it work on a good day?

20:01.867 --> 20:04.035
It's designed to be pain-free.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.746
It's three drugs administered
in a specific order.

20:06.914 --> 20:09.081
From this point on, we're operating
under the assumption

20:09.249 --> 20:10.666
that the machine was corrupted.

20:10.834 --> 20:13.753
We're gonna need a list of all
the people with access to that machine.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.505
- My people would not do this.
- I appreciate that, Warden,

20:16.673 --> 20:20.051
but I'm gonna need more than
a hall pass and a note from Mom.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.261
Detectives, got this off
the back of the machine.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.680
- Check it out.
- Let me see it.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.807
Right there.

20:26.975 --> 20:28.809
"Can't fight fate."

20:28.977 --> 20:30.645
What is it, Nick?

20:30.812 --> 20:33.064
During the home invasion,
Ames's accomplice

20:33.232 --> 20:35.399
said to one of the vics,
"You can't fight fate."

20:35.567 --> 20:38.861
And then he said the same thing
to me in the courtroom- prick.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.739
I can't remember his name, though.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.450
Have a look at this-
your guy?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.827
- Clarence James Darby.
- He's a cutie.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.913
- You got history with him?
- Put him away.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.791
All right, three years. That the going
rate for murder these days?

20:51.959 --> 20:53.501
There was extenuating
circumstances.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.963
The only extenuating circumstances
should be he didn't do it.

20:57.130 --> 20:59.840
Still, three years at Marion?
Fucking gladiator academy.

21:00.008 --> 21:01.801
You expect him to come back
a modeI citizen?

21:01.969 --> 21:04.387
Well, if you scholars wouldn't
contaminate the crime scenes,

21:04.554 --> 21:05.930
I could keep them
locked up longer.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.140
Authorities have refused
to comment at this point,

21:08.308 --> 21:10.268
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

21:10.435 --> 21:12.979
The prisoner had been on death row
for the past 10 years-

21:13.146 --> 21:14.605
his name, Rupert Ames.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.148
All we know at this point

21:16.316 --> 21:18.609
is what was supposed to be
a painless execution

21:18.777 --> 21:21.570
has turned into something
out of a horror film.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.870
Yeah?

21:30.038 --> 21:32.123
- Clarence Darby?
- Who's this?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.293
coke on the table,

21:35.460 --> 21:38.045
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.674
Who the fuck is this?

21:41.842 --> 21:44.552
Look out your window,
south side.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.681
- Is this a joke? Get up!
- Ahh!

21:48.849 --> 21:51.100
South side.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.897
Motherfucker.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.859
Shit. Out of the way!

22:11.872 --> 22:14.081
- Stay down!
- You're all crazy!

22:14.249 --> 22:17.001
He's heading north!
Go go!

22:17.169 --> 22:19.962
- Damn.
- Move it, move it. Go on!

22:28.180 --> 22:30.848
- What now?
- Wipe the prints off the gun.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.142
- Get rid of it.
- No no.

22:33.310 --> 22:37.021
You fired six times, genius.
You bring any ammunition?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.898
- Lose it.
- Why are you doing this?

22:39.066 --> 22:40.733
I want to keep you
out of prison.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.652
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.820
Why?

22:44.988 --> 22:46.781
There's a cop car there
with a cop in it.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.115
What the fuck?

22:48.283 --> 22:50.910
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up
in about 90 seconds,

22:51.078 --> 22:52.912
so you'd better move.

23:10.138 --> 23:14.058
Rise and fucking shine, bitch.
Wake the fuck up!

23:14.226 --> 23:16.060
Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

23:16.228 --> 23:17.311
- Okay!
- Do it.

23:17.479 --> 23:19.772
- Take it easy, take it-
- Come on!

23:19.940 --> 23:21.607
- Okay, let's go.
- Take it easy.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.652
Let's go!
Get in gear, shithead, now!

23:24.820 --> 23:27.154
Do it! Go go go!

23:42.671 --> 23:44.880
Get the fuck out.

23:50.303 --> 23:52.304
Let's go.

23:52.472 --> 23:54.432
Get the fuck down there!

23:54.599 --> 23:58.602
Okay. What about my wife?
My little girl?

23:58.770 --> 24:01.981
- I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, ain't it?

24:02.149 --> 24:05.025
Oh oh oh.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.611
You don't mind if
I take this, do you?

24:07.779 --> 24:10.030
My guardian angel.

24:10.198 --> 24:12.032
I am impressed.

24:12.200 --> 24:16.245
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

24:20.750 --> 24:23.210
'Cause you took 'em from me.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.595
You remember me?

24:34.139 --> 24:36.182
Sure you do.

24:36.349 --> 24:39.059
You came over to my house
once before.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.270
You don't remember?

24:43.190 --> 24:47.651
This tetrodotoxin...

24:48.653 --> 24:51.155
should be nicely into
your system by now.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.075
It's isolated from the liver
of a Caribbean puffer fish.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.829
So it paralyzes you,

24:58.997 --> 25:02.041
but leaves all the other
neurological functions

25:02.209 --> 25:04.084
perfectly intact.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.588
In other words, you can't move...

25:08.757 --> 25:11.300
but you feel everything.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.805
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.767
And you're about to
experience more of that

25:19.935 --> 25:22.311
than you could ever
fucking imagine.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.739
These are tourniquets

25:33.907 --> 25:37.993
so you don't bleed out,
'cause you may be here a while.

25:38.161 --> 25:40.246
Saline solution-

25:40.413 --> 25:42.957
that should keep us going.

25:43.124 --> 25:47.211
Clamps- nice and secure.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.257
Comfortable?

25:51.424 --> 25:54.051
You really are shaking.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.470
Sure you're all right?

25:57.681 --> 26:00.891
You'll love this-

26:01.059 --> 26:03.143
adrenaline.

26:03.311 --> 26:07.398
Now this is so you
don't pass out.

26:08.984 --> 26:11.151
There you go.

26:11.319 --> 26:14.488
How's that feel? Good?

26:16.116 --> 26:19.118
Now what we don't want
is you swallowing your tongue,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.412
so bear with me.

26:27.544 --> 26:31.297
Now this is for your penis,
but we'll get to that later.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.176
Scalpel...

26:36.344 --> 26:38.304
for your eyelids,

26:38.471 --> 26:41.307
in case you insist
on fucking shutting them.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.519
You see,

26:45.687 --> 26:49.356
I know what it feels like
to be helpless.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.943
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

26:55.238 --> 26:59.283
You know you can't
fight fate, right, Darby?

27:01.286 --> 27:02.536
Oh!

27:02.704 --> 27:07.124
And look-
I made this especially for you.

27:09.794 --> 27:13.422
You like it? Yeah,
I didn't want you to miss anything.

27:14.633 --> 27:19.094
Now you have the best
view in the house.

27:19.262 --> 27:21.138
You hear that?

27:21.306 --> 27:24.516
Your heart is beating so fast.

27:26.353 --> 27:28.646
No, me too.

27:28.813 --> 27:30.272
Okay.

27:33.276 --> 27:36.362
Now they get to
watch you suffer.

27:38.114 --> 27:41.742
They'll be the last thing
you ever see

27:41.910 --> 27:45.204
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.666
See, I wasn't lying

27:48.833 --> 27:52.544
when I told you that I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.591
That was the truth.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.963
Thanks for the car.

29:01.197 --> 29:04.199
Okay, these are all
the case files on Darby.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.035
I vetted through what I could.
We have crime-scene photos-

29:07.203 --> 29:09.037
Don't need to see 'em.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.749
Okay.

29:17.338 --> 29:20.215
- What's bothering you?
- It's Darby.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.218
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

29:23.386 --> 29:25.554
and that was violence.
But yesterday at that execution,

29:25.722 --> 29:27.723
- that wasn't violence. That was-
- What?

29:27.891 --> 29:30.184
- That was intellect.
- Okay.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.520
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

29:33.688 --> 29:37.357
I'm just thinking maybe
we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.078
Jesus Christ.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.384
Rice.

30:04.552 --> 30:07.471
Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.724
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.645
They found him in about 25 pieces:

30:14.813 --> 30:18.273
no legs, no arms,
eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.275
- Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite.

30:20.443 --> 30:23.445
- I see your wheels turning.
- Think motive- who has one?

30:23.613 --> 30:26.281
The husband, the father.
What do we know about him?

30:26.449 --> 30:28.200
He owned the warehouse
where they found Darby.

30:28.368 --> 30:29.701
- What else?
- He's a tinkerer-

30:29.869 --> 30:33.622
uh, little inventions, gizmos.
He holds two dozen patents

30:33.790 --> 30:35.374
that made him some money.

30:35.542 --> 30:38.377
He liquidated most of
his wealth a few years ago

30:38.545 --> 30:42.172
to buy some industrial
properties around airports,

30:42.340 --> 30:44.216
chemical plants,
raiI yards.

30:44.384 --> 30:46.885
- It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

30:47.053 --> 30:48.512
Search 'em all, Sarah.
See what you find.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.674
Freeze!

32:09.010 --> 32:10.928
- Get down, go!
- On your knees!

32:12.096 --> 32:14.723
- Face down, face down!
- Pull him down and cuff him!

32:50.843 --> 32:54.054
Crazy men scare
the shit out of me.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.348
Is this guy a lawyer?

32:56.516 --> 32:57.975
No.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.770
He's an engineer.

33:01.938 --> 33:04.982
Nick, look at this.

33:42.311 --> 33:45.105
We have zero evidence.
Gonna need a confession.

33:45.273 --> 33:47.024
He give you any trouble
on the way in?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.400
No, nothing.

33:48.568 --> 33:51.319
He wasn't too happy when
we took his bracelet, though.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.789
- Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.876
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

34:07.587 --> 34:11.255
Mom, the video from my recital came.
Can we watch it?

34:11.424 --> 34:13.967
- Please?
- No, not you.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.719
No, please, we said we were
gonna wait for your father, remember?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.972
- Please?
- No, not now.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.224
Okay.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.770
Uh-huh, yes.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.774
Yes, absolutely.

34:48.168 --> 34:49.878
Mommy!

35:05.812 --> 35:09.106
Don't worry, he's just disarming
the guy, letting him feeI easy.

35:09.273 --> 35:13.485
What I'm about to tell you
I don't want anybody else to hear.

35:13.653 --> 35:16.404
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking
all the rules right now,

35:16.572 --> 35:19.282
and I don't give a damn
because I'm a father.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.368
I have a little girl.

35:21.536 --> 35:25.288
And what you did... bravo.

35:27.041 --> 35:31.461
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

35:31.629 --> 35:36.133
You're not gonna see a tear shed
from me or anybody in my office.

35:39.887 --> 35:43.515
With that being said...

35:43.683 --> 35:45.892
I have a job to do.

35:48.104 --> 35:50.522
I'm gonna ask you some very simple
and direct questions.

35:50.690 --> 35:54.568
I suggest that you
answer them in the same fashion.

35:54.735 --> 35:56.736
Is your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

35:57.738 --> 35:58.822
Yes, sir.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.740
And you've waived
your right to counsel, correct?

36:00.908 --> 36:04.703
- Yes, sir.
- You sure you want to do that?

36:04.871 --> 36:06.079
Yes.

36:06.247 --> 36:09.666
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

36:11.043 --> 36:13.628
I wanted him dead.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.463
He killed my wife and child.

36:15.631 --> 36:18.842
Rupert Ames-
did you murder him as well?

36:20.511 --> 36:22.387
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

36:22.555 --> 36:25.515
They both deserved to die.

36:25.683 --> 36:29.269
So you arranged
both of those murders?

36:30.521 --> 36:31.771
Yes, I planned it...

36:31.939 --> 36:35.775
in my head, over and over again.
It took me a long time.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.780
All right.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.116
I guess we're done here.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.869
Counselor?

36:47.622 --> 36:51.291
You might want to canceI
your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

36:52.293 --> 36:53.919
Excuse me?

36:54.086 --> 36:56.421
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week,

36:56.589 --> 36:59.299
'cause you're gonna be busy.
Sit down.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.678
We're done here.
We have your confession.

37:03.846 --> 37:06.181
Mmm. Oh, you do?

37:06.349 --> 37:07.933
On tape.

37:08.100 --> 37:10.936
See, in our profession,
we consider that a slam-dunk.

37:11.103 --> 37:13.855
Oh, really?
I don't think so. Let's think back.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.690
What did I say?

37:15.858 --> 37:18.860
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

37:19.028 --> 37:21.363
Yeah, sure.
What father wouldn't?

37:21.530 --> 37:24.157
That both Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

37:24.325 --> 37:25.951
I think most people
would agree with that.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.371
That I planned it over and over
again in my head?

37:29.538 --> 37:32.791
Yeah. Who wouldn't
fantasize about that?

37:32.959 --> 37:35.669
None of these are
an admission of guilt, Nick.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.546
- You might want to check the tape.
- We know you did it.

37:38.714 --> 37:42.050
Well, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove in court.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.677
Didn't you tell me that once?

37:43.844 --> 37:45.178
The only problem with your theory

37:45.346 --> 37:47.472
is that Darby's body was
found on your property.

37:47.640 --> 37:50.809
One of my many properties-
an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.895
Junkies, they trespass there
all the time.

37:54.063 --> 37:56.147
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

37:56.315 --> 37:59.025
That's an unsavory world.
I bet you a jury would agree.

37:59.193 --> 38:02.237
Or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

38:02.405 --> 38:04.114
You know, Clyde,

38:04.282 --> 38:07.367
there's a lot of assholes in prison
that thought they were smarter than me.

38:07.535 --> 38:10.078
Let's stop fucking around.

38:10.246 --> 38:13.206
Nick, unless you have any
hard evidence,

38:13.374 --> 38:15.750
then why are we even here?
Why are we having this-

38:15.918 --> 38:18.336
- What do you want?
- -conversation?

38:20.172 --> 38:22.632
Well, that's easy.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.094
Now you're the one who
makes deals with murderers, yeah?

38:26.262 --> 38:28.471
So I've come to make mine.

38:28.639 --> 38:33.143
I will give you a confession,
a reaI confession.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.478
You just have to
give me something in return.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.815
Yeah, well, since you
are a murderer, what might that be?

38:39.817 --> 38:41.151
A bed.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.114
But a nice bed.

38:46.282 --> 38:48.700
I want a nice new one
for my cell.

38:48.868 --> 38:50.368
Very simple.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.079
You're gonna have to deal with that,
because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

38:53.247 --> 38:55.290
It's making me crazy.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.043
Clyde, I think you've got me
confused with detail people.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.295
See, I don't deaI
with prison conditions.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.714
I believe those cots
are bolted into the cells.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.967
Well, that's what wrenches are for,
dumbass.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.387
You know, one of those new
Duxiana beds

39:09.555 --> 39:12.891
with the adjustable- you know,
adjustable lumbar support,

39:13.059 --> 39:14.392
- that's the one.
- I've seen the commercial.

39:14.560 --> 39:15.977
- That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.979
- 'Cause really-
- Comes on late at night.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.814
- And frankly I don't think-
- Two old people laying on the bed.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.399
- I'll be able to focus
on anything

39:21.567 --> 39:23.735
untiI I've had a good
revitalizing night's sleep

39:23.903 --> 39:26.154
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

39:26.322 --> 39:28.031
So that's the deal:

39:28.199 --> 39:31.743
you get me my bed,
you get your confession.

39:31.911 --> 39:34.746
Okay, let me think
about that for a second.

39:34.914 --> 39:37.040
How about...

39:37.208 --> 39:39.000
fuck no.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.012
Hey, what are you doing?

39:51.180 --> 39:53.306
- What do you mean?
- Why did you tell him no?

39:53.474 --> 39:56.601
A mattress? He doesn't make
those kinds of decisions.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.938
Take your ego out of it, Nick. Shelton's
- this case is shit.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.440
We need a confession.
And a mattress for a murder confession?

40:02.608 --> 40:04.818
- That's a pretty good deal.
- He's playing us, Jonas.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.486
Well, then we will play him.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.238
Nick?

40:08.406 --> 40:10.949
There's an urgent call from your office.
They say you're not answering your cell.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.952
I need to finish up here and then
I will be home as soon as I can.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.037
the things on this video-

40:16.205 --> 40:18.832
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.333
Please come home.

40:20.501 --> 40:24.337
Listen, you need to calm down.
Tell her that it's not real...

40:24.505 --> 40:26.172
- Okay.
- ...and that I love her.

40:26.340 --> 40:27.382
Come home.
Come home soon, please.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.384
- Kelly, did you see his face?
- No.

40:29.552 --> 40:31.636
It was covered with something.
I couldn't see.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.806
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and
I'll come home as fast as I can, okay?

40:34.974 --> 40:36.850
Okay.

40:37.017 --> 40:40.103
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house
of him killing Darby.

40:40.271 --> 40:43.064
- What?
- My daughter saw it.

40:44.817 --> 40:46.401
He recorded it?
We've got him.

40:46.569 --> 40:50.029
No no, he had on a mask.
We need that confession.

40:50.197 --> 40:52.323
You still want to bargain
with this man?

40:52.491 --> 40:54.701
The art of the possible, Warden.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.369
Make the deal.

40:58.789 --> 41:02.000
Hey, come on, man! Give us one!

41:14.054 --> 41:17.932
Back problems, Warden-
the worst.

41:18.100 --> 41:20.518
You got bigger problems than that.

41:20.686 --> 41:23.271
It's the have-nots in here, son.

41:23.439 --> 41:27.108
I don't know that I want
to be the one "have."

41:30.029 --> 41:32.363
Turn around.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.036
I don't think he likes me.

41:40.581 --> 41:42.415
Nice bed.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.252
Thank you.

41:46.420 --> 41:48.922
It's a single.

41:50.424 --> 41:53.635
I'd watch my fucking back
around here, you hear?

41:55.054 --> 41:56.429
In the cell, let's go.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.143
We can't put
Clyde Shelton anywhere-

42:02.311 --> 42:04.395
not in a job, not in a city,
not even the country.

42:04.563 --> 42:07.607
So I dug a little deeper and I found
something from his missing years:

42:07.775 --> 42:11.277
a couple of contract payments to Clyde
from the Department of Defense.

42:11.445 --> 42:14.113
- And his real estate?
- He bought nine properties

42:14.281 --> 42:16.199
under his own name,
then he transferred them

42:16.367 --> 42:17.534
to some corporation in Panama.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.577
We can't get to the addresses.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.162
A lack of reciprocity
is our problem.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.914
So I'm gonna circle
back to the farmhouse.

42:23.082 --> 42:26.292
That's a waste of time. He wanted us
to find it and find him there.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.670
It's the industrial stuff
that's curious.

42:28.837 --> 42:31.339
All right, I don't care what you
have to do and who you have to piss off.

42:31.507 --> 42:34.008
If we have to invade
Panama again, fine.

42:34.176 --> 42:36.678
Clyde is hiding those properties
for a reason. Find him.

42:36.845 --> 42:38.096
Got it.

42:50.192 --> 42:52.902
- Baby, you leave it cracked?
- Hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

42:53.070 --> 42:55.780
- Night light?
- Isn't she too old for a night light?

42:55.948 --> 42:58.199
Yeah, I left a night light.

42:58.367 --> 43:00.243
- Good.
- Look,

43:00.411 --> 43:02.245
I told her that
that video wasn't real.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.664
- Okay.
- It's some sort of horror film-

43:04.832 --> 43:06.332
something she shouldn't
be looking at anyway.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.209
- Okay, good.
- She'll be okay.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.877
Yeah. And you?

43:10.045 --> 43:12.964
- Am I what? Okay?
- Yeah.

43:13.132 --> 43:15.174
Of course.
Don't I look okay?

43:15.342 --> 43:17.218
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.764
Nick is always okay.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.559
Always- I'm extra good.

43:26.228 --> 43:28.187
I love you.

43:28.355 --> 43:29.772
I love you too.

43:35.613 --> 43:38.114
In light of Mr. Shelton's
economic means

43:38.282 --> 43:39.991
and his potential flight risk,

43:40.159 --> 43:43.578
the egregious nature of both
Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

43:43.746 --> 43:47.582
the state requests that
bail be denied, Your Honor.

43:49.293 --> 43:50.918
Seeing as how you've...

43:51.086 --> 43:54.088
waived your right to
counsel, Mr. Shelton,

43:54.256 --> 43:56.507
do you have anything to say?

43:56.675 --> 43:58.676
Mr. Shelton?

43:59.970 --> 44:03.181
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton?

44:03.349 --> 44:05.683
Yes yes yes, Your Honor.

44:05.851 --> 44:08.728
- Should I stand?
- Please.

44:16.987 --> 44:19.864
Your Honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen.

44:20.032 --> 44:21.908
I'm just a regular guy.

44:22.076 --> 44:24.869
I am not a flight risk.

44:25.037 --> 44:27.622
And this is my first alleged offense.

44:27.790 --> 44:32.418
And the prosecution has not presented
one single piece of evidence against me.

44:33.921 --> 44:35.963
Now in these circumstances,

44:36.131 --> 44:38.633
unless the state has obtained
some new piece of information

44:38.801 --> 44:41.552
relating to my involvement
in the matter in question,

44:41.720 --> 44:45.640
then I find it highly prejudiciaI,
even constitutionally offensive,

44:45.808 --> 44:48.101
to keep me detained without bail.

44:48.268 --> 44:50.353
It's a slippery slope,
Your Honor.

44:50.521 --> 44:53.648
Haven't we seen the result
of such violations,

44:53.816 --> 44:56.234
both internationally and domestically?
Case in point

44:56.402 --> 45:00.697
would be Day v. McDonough,
docket #041325.

45:02.741 --> 45:07.453
I am actually inclined
to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

45:08.706 --> 45:11.791
Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has
agreed to give us a full confession.

45:13.210 --> 45:14.919
Has he given it, Mr. Rice?

45:15.087 --> 45:16.546
No, Your Honor.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.382
Well, then in my opinion,

45:19.550 --> 45:22.301
the state has failed to establish
a compelling basis

45:22.469 --> 45:25.638
for its motion,
and I will grant bail in the amount of-

45:25.806 --> 45:27.974
Your Honor,
I would caution you not to do that.

45:28.142 --> 45:30.810
Thank you.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.520
Excuse me?

45:32.688 --> 45:35.314
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

45:35.482 --> 45:37.358
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

45:37.526 --> 45:40.445
You were about to let me go.
Are you kidding me?

45:40.612 --> 45:44.031
This is why we're here
in the first place.

45:45.117 --> 45:47.952
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

45:48.120 --> 45:50.955
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.832
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

45:53.000 --> 45:55.710
Because apparently
I just killed two people,

45:55.878 --> 45:59.338
and you were about to let me
walk right out that door!

45:59.506 --> 46:01.883
How misguided are you?

46:02.050 --> 46:05.386
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal precedents,

46:05.554 --> 46:08.639
and there you go- you jump
on it like a bitch in heat.

46:08.807 --> 46:11.267
- Folks, you all hang out-
- I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton!

46:11.435 --> 46:13.352
- -in the same little club.
- You will be held in contempt!

46:13.520 --> 46:15.730
And every day you let madmen
and murderers back on the street.

46:15.898 --> 46:18.316
- You're too busy treating the law-
- One more time!

46:18.484 --> 46:19.859
- -like it's a fucking assembly line!
- One more time.

46:20.027 --> 46:21.736
- Do you have any idea what justice is?
- You are now-

46:21.904 --> 46:23.821
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- -in contempt of court.

46:23.989 --> 46:27.074
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- Remove this man.

46:27.242 --> 46:29.702
- Whatever happened to the people?
- Bail denied!

46:29.870 --> 46:31.829
- Whatever happened to justice?
- Bail denied!

46:31.997 --> 46:35.208
And I bet you take it up
the fucking ass, bitch.

46:35.375 --> 46:36.542
Bailiff.

46:36.710 --> 46:38.503
Hey, see you later, Nick.

46:39.755 --> 46:41.964
Insanity?

46:43.050 --> 46:45.885
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

46:48.555 --> 46:50.723
Nick, I told you I would
give you a confession.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.600
And I- I meant it.

46:52.768 --> 46:54.852
- I saw a movie today.
- You did?

46:55.020 --> 46:57.855
My daughter saw the same movie.

46:58.023 --> 47:00.900
Well, you taught your daughter
about good versus eviI?

47:01.068 --> 47:02.735
I don't have to.

47:02.903 --> 47:06.364
Well, that's what this movie was about:
good conquering evil,

47:06.532 --> 47:08.866
the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

47:09.034 --> 47:10.952
I didn't get that.

47:11.119 --> 47:14.121
I'm gonna give you
one more chance, Clyde.

47:14.289 --> 47:17.792
And don't test me
'cause I will run you over.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.877
Fair enough.

47:20.045 --> 47:22.588
You did get me my bed.

47:22.756 --> 47:25.049
A deal's a deal.

47:25.217 --> 47:27.927
That was you on video
killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

47:28.095 --> 47:29.846
Yes, that was me.

47:32.724 --> 47:35.643
Okay, fair enough.
That was me, Clyde Shelton,

47:35.811 --> 47:37.687
on the video,
killing Clarence Darby.

47:37.855 --> 47:39.939
Not good enough, Clyde.
I need specifics.

47:42.985 --> 47:45.945
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

47:46.113 --> 47:47.321
his toes with tin snips,

47:47.489 --> 47:49.824
his balls with a hacksaw,

47:49.992 --> 47:53.286
and his penis with a box cutter.

47:53.453 --> 47:55.162
How's that for specifics?

47:56.248 --> 47:57.623
And Ames?

47:57.791 --> 48:01.419
Switching the canisters was easy.
Everything's automated these days,

48:01.587 --> 48:03.838
so I just hacked into
the shipping company's server

48:04.006 --> 48:06.924
and swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

48:07.092 --> 48:09.302
Then I switched
the potassium chloride

48:09.469 --> 48:13.764
with something a little more...
deliberate.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.143
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.228
I got everything I need.

48:20.230 --> 48:21.564
What now?

48:21.732 --> 48:23.482
I go home;
you go to prison.

48:23.650 --> 48:26.068
You know, the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.487
That ought to make you
feel better about the system.

48:28.655 --> 48:29.947
What if I had another
confession to make?

48:30.115 --> 48:31.824
Call a priest.

48:31.992 --> 48:33.868
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick,

48:34.036 --> 48:37.079
so you would have to
give me something in return.

48:40.292 --> 48:44.295
You ever been to Del Frisco's?
They cater.

48:44.463 --> 48:48.299
So for lunch, I would love
a 200z porterhouse steak,

48:48.467 --> 48:50.927
medium,
maybe a little bit charred,

48:51.094 --> 48:55.389
with all the trimmings-
pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

48:55.557 --> 48:58.100
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

48:59.770 --> 49:02.271
can I have my iPod as well?

49:02.439 --> 49:05.274
I'd love a little bit
of music with my meal.

49:05.442 --> 49:08.319
First rule of negotiating, Clyde: you
gotta have something to bargain with.

49:08.487 --> 49:11.989
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

49:17.329 --> 49:20.498
Open it.

49:23.001 --> 49:25.002
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

49:25.170 --> 49:26.837
Darby's attorney.

49:27.005 --> 49:29.423
Tell me you located him.

49:29.591 --> 49:33.177
I've got his wife.
She reported him missing three days ago.

49:33.345 --> 49:35.221
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

49:35.389 --> 49:38.432
Well, looks like I got something
to bargain with after all, Nick.

49:39.977 --> 49:42.603
At the moment,
Bill Reynolds is still alive.

49:42.771 --> 49:45.648
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

49:45.816 --> 49:49.652
Just bring me my meal and
my music at 1:00 exactly.

49:49.820 --> 49:52.238
00 sharp.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.532
00, Nick.

50:08.380 --> 50:10.423
That's good, right there.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.137
All right, up!

50:22.436 --> 50:26.022
- It's 5 to 1:00.
- I don't take orders from him or you.

50:26.189 --> 50:28.065
And inmates don't have
access to the time.

50:28.233 --> 50:31.152
- We tell them what time it is.
- I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

50:31.319 --> 50:33.362
We need to stick to the timeline
that was agreed to.

50:33.530 --> 50:35.656
Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

50:35.824 --> 50:37.533
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

50:37.701 --> 50:39.869
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.912
Check it again.

50:45.751 --> 50:48.294
Are you shitting me with this?!

50:51.089 --> 50:52.590
This motherfucker!

50:57.220 --> 50:59.805
Man, come on!
I'm fucking hungry!

51:05.604 --> 51:07.813
Steamed asparagus,

51:07.981 --> 51:10.816
- lobster macaroni and cheese...
- Wow.

51:12.360 --> 51:15.529
...porterhouse steak,
seared, medium rare.

51:17.199 --> 51:18.657
Mmm!

51:23.121 --> 51:24.789
Hmm.

51:24.956 --> 51:27.041
- Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

51:29.503 --> 51:32.338
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

51:32.506 --> 51:35.549
You might want to put 30%
down for yourself, my man.

51:38.637 --> 51:41.514
- Hey, what time is it?
- It's 1:00.

51:42.808 --> 51:44.350
Is that right, Nick?

51:44.518 --> 51:48.229
- It's 1:08.
- That's disappointing, Warden.

51:48.396 --> 51:50.606
I mean, how can you expect me
not to fuck with you

51:50.774 --> 51:52.316
when you can't even
be honest with me?

51:52.484 --> 51:56.362
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you
asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

51:56.530 --> 51:58.447
Can I have some silverware,
gentlemen?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.032
Silverware.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.493
You get a spork.

52:03.495 --> 52:05.538
Idiot.

52:07.874 --> 52:09.542
Thanks.

52:18.468 --> 52:20.427
Come on, Clyde.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.600
Okay.

52:26.768 --> 52:29.520
Here we go:

52:29.688 --> 52:32.815
39N57'...

52:32.983 --> 52:34.567
04",

52:34.734 --> 52:38.404
075W10'22".

52:38.572 --> 52:40.197
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

52:40.365 --> 52:42.908
'Cause by anybody's watch but
the warden's, you're already late.

52:43.076 --> 52:45.786
- Open the door!
- Where's my lunch?

52:52.502 --> 52:54.753
I'll take a ground unit!

53:16.610 --> 53:19.528
So I suppose if I don't
share this with you, you're gonna-

53:19.696 --> 53:21.155
I'm gonna get the fuck up,

53:21.323 --> 53:23.324
I'm gonna cock back
my right hand,

53:23.491 --> 53:27.077
and I'm gonna split your whole
fucking skull in two. How about that?

53:28.622 --> 53:31.916
Well, come on over here. Join me.
There's plenty to go around.

53:36.171 --> 53:39.882
Here, enjoy.
Have some pasta.

53:40.050 --> 53:42.176
It's good.

53:42.344 --> 53:43.969
What about some steak?
You want steak?

53:44.137 --> 53:45.638
- Mmm.
- Here, have some steak.

53:45.805 --> 53:47.932
Here's a big piece for you.

53:48.099 --> 53:50.226
There you go.

53:53.939 --> 53:55.397
Good, huh?

54:04.783 --> 54:07.493
What'd you do
to get in here, anyways?

54:09.704 --> 54:11.997
I did what I had to do.

54:17.212 --> 54:19.421
So you got a girl or something?

54:21.925 --> 54:24.802
Mmm, it's a long story.

54:28.807 --> 54:30.683
Pilot, how much longer?

54:30.850 --> 54:33.936
Two minutes.

54:36.773 --> 54:39.191
How about you?
You have a girl?

54:39.359 --> 54:41.860
- Got a few girls back home.
- Oh, yeah?

54:42.028 --> 54:43.696
Yeah.

54:43.863 --> 54:46.865
- You have a boyfriend in here or no?
- Get the fuck out of here.

55:01.089 --> 55:02.923
This is- it's Reynolds's.

55:04.050 --> 55:06.427
- Not a good sign, Nick.
- Just dig.

55:20.442 --> 55:22.276
- Jesus Christ!
- Reynolds!

55:22.444 --> 55:25.487
- He's unconscious.
- Reynolds!

55:25.655 --> 55:28.657
He's gone, Nick.
He's gone.

55:28.825 --> 55:30.868
- Oxygen?
- Get something to get him out!

55:31.036 --> 55:34.538
He's got IV lines
going to his-

55:34.706 --> 55:36.832
He's got him cuffed!

55:37.000 --> 55:40.461
Listen, you got your keys
to the cuffs?

55:42.172 --> 55:44.423
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

55:44.591 --> 55:46.300
Shit.

55:46.468 --> 55:49.136
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

55:49.304 --> 55:51.805
Your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

55:51.973 --> 55:54.850
Here, wanna take a shot at this?

55:55.018 --> 55:57.144
- What is it?
- Know how to use it?

55:57.312 --> 55:59.563
No.

56:16.331 --> 56:19.208
Oh, shit! Check this out!

56:22.295 --> 56:24.546
He's crazy!

56:24.714 --> 56:26.215
Don't stop now, partner!

56:26.383 --> 56:29.218
Finish him, come on!
Take his head off!

56:29.386 --> 56:33.639
Take it off!

57:03.461 --> 57:05.838
I need a shower, Warden.

57:06.005 --> 57:07.214
Get him out of there!

57:10.760 --> 57:13.220
Dunnigan,
what time do you have?

57:15.473 --> 57:16.765
37.

57:16.933 --> 57:18.725
Took us roughly 15 minutes
to get here.

57:18.893 --> 57:19.977
Yeah?

57:20.145 --> 57:22.646
Reynolds's air was rigged to
shut off at 1:15.

57:22.814 --> 57:25.566
If Shelton would have got
his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

57:25.733 --> 57:27.025
Fuck this guy, Nick.

57:27.193 --> 57:30.946
He wants to play games,
we can play games too.

57:31.114 --> 57:33.449
We need to take the gloves off.

57:33.616 --> 57:35.325
No.

57:39.456 --> 57:42.499
Nick, it's Sarah.
Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

57:42.667 --> 57:46.545
The warden is furious.
He's moving him to solitary.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.964
That's all I know right now.

58:19.829 --> 58:22.664
How are we doing?

58:22.832 --> 58:25.751
Great. Can you believe this?

58:25.919 --> 58:29.046
Checking his iPod for clues.

58:29.214 --> 58:30.756
I do the same thing
with my daughter's.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.633
Learn anything?

58:32.800 --> 58:35.219
Yeah, they both got
shit taste in music.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.640
We got a game plan
with this guy or what?

58:39.807 --> 58:41.391
Game plan?

58:41.559 --> 58:43.435
I tell you, I got a game plan.

58:43.603 --> 58:46.313
Give me five minutes alone with him
and I'll cripple the fucker.

58:46.481 --> 58:49.483
I don't give a shit
what happened to his family.

58:49.651 --> 58:51.109
It's no excuse.

58:58.201 --> 58:59.785
Wow.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.585
Stop right there.

59:17.262 --> 59:18.971
Step into the cell.

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.644
We found Reynolds.

01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.772
Moments too late,
from what I hear.

01:00:10.940 --> 01:00:14.693
I had to call his wife and tell her
that her husband had been buried alive.

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:17.696
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:20.365
but especially for those
who denied it to others.

01:00:20.533 --> 01:00:23.118
And your cell-mate?
What was that about?

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.666
You murdered a man
because your lunch was late.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:31.668
No.

01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:36.089
No. No, you murdered him
because you couldn't keep your word.

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:39.343
We made a deal, you and I:
00 PM.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:42.387
That's a pretty important principle
I'd like you start learning, Nick:

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:44.473
- keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.559
What principle was at work when
you tortured and killed those people?

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:51.605
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.489
You think your wife
and daughter would feel good

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.492
about you killing in their name?

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:32.771
My wife and daughter
can't feeI anything.

01:01:34.148 --> 01:01:36.149
They're dead.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.062
Hey, Nick?

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.565
On Clyde's real estate,
Judge Stansfield shut us down.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:20.193
He's looking for some sort of legal
precedent that I'm not sure exists.

01:02:20.361 --> 01:02:21.403
- But?
- But...

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:22.863
I think I may have found
a way around it.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:25.198
- I'll call in a favor from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

01:02:25.366 --> 01:02:27.534
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing you favors.

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:29.369
Something else Cantrell said.

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:33.540
No, that was all you.
Jonas, hi.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:37.669
She's thinking just like you, Nick.
Guess you trained her well.

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:40.839
- One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:46.219
Clyde's government contract payments
were bothering me,

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:48.972
so I pulled some ancient strings.
We're meeting someone.

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:50.599
Who might that be?

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.603
Someone who does some really nasty shit
so we can live the American dream.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.742
So Clyde finally lost it?

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.036
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.538
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

01:03:13.706 --> 01:03:17.417
Okay, first of all,
I was never here and we never spoke.

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:20.212
Tell us what we're dealing with.
Shelton was a spy or-

01:03:20.379 --> 01:03:22.964
Spies are a dime a dozen.
I'm a spy.

01:03:23.132 --> 01:03:26.635
Clyde is a brain.
He's a think-tank type guy.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:29.304
His specialty was low-impact
kinetic operations.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:31.848
Is this a hell of a fancy way
to say that he kills people?

01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:33.141
We kill people.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.811
He figured out how to do it
without ever being in the same room.

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:39.314
It was his gift,
and he was the best.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:41.900
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.569
I mean, we're using cruise missiles
and predators

01:03:44.737 --> 01:03:48.532
and we even had a B-2 bomber
flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

01:03:48.699 --> 01:03:50.325
All right? We're burning up
millions in ordnance

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.827
and we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:54.913
So we call Clyde and
we ask him to solve our problem.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.998
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.835
with a high-tech ratchet
made of carbon fiber

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.878
put in a necktie.

01:04:02.046 --> 01:04:04.631
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy
comes home,

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:07.509
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead
on the bathroom tile,

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.010
choked to death.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:13.682
What I'm saying is, just assume
that this guy can hear and see

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.517
everything that you're doing.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.811
No, we've got him locked away,
maximum security.

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:20.981
If he's in jail, it's because
he wants to be in jail.

01:04:21.148 --> 01:04:24.818
He's a born tactician. Every move
that he makes, it means something.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.321
That cell-mate that he killed-
you think that was random?

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:31.658
No.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.452
That's a pawn being
moved off the board.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.874
If I were you,
I'd be looking for the next piece.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.710
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.879
he's gonna be coming after you.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:49.092
So what are you saying?
You saying we can't stop him?

01:04:51.178 --> 01:04:54.014
Walk into his cell
and put a bullet in his head.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:58.852
Aside from that?
No, you can't stop him.

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.479
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.952
- Hello?
- Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:17.871
Set up a meeting
with Judge Burch.

01:05:18.039 --> 01:05:20.040
We need her to help us
keep Clyde on ice.

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:22.834
Help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:24.711
He's worse than we thought.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:27.339
- Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester.

01:05:27.506 --> 01:05:29.341
Yeah.

01:05:29.508 --> 01:05:32.719
Good. Maybe stay a few days
at his place.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.931
And have Dunnigan send
a patroI car to my house.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:37.849
Sorry about this, Sarah.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:47.317
I can't supersede the penal code.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:48.944
You've already got him in solitary.

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:51.363
A half-decent paralegal will have him
out of there by next week.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:53.198
We just want to limit his options;

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:55.033
give him less contact,
less access,

01:05:55.201 --> 01:05:58.495
even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise period for a week.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.789
- Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.166
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:06.920
that helps you rationalize it,
Your Honor.

01:06:08.714 --> 01:06:09.923
So let me get this straight:

01:06:10.091 --> 01:06:12.759
you want me to violate
his God-given civil rights

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.762
in the name of some murky sense
of the greater good.

01:06:15.930 --> 01:06:18.056
Is that the gist of it, gentlemen?

01:06:24.814 --> 01:06:27.273
Okay. I'm game.

01:06:28.275 --> 01:06:32.445
Just don't plan
on it sticking for long, all right?

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.659
Wait, you're gonna take that,

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.911
after all the grief you've
given me over cell phones?

01:06:40.079 --> 01:06:42.998
That's one of the benefits of
being a judge, Mr. Rice.

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:46.209
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.005
Hello?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:54.300
Oh my God.

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:57.053
Back out. Back out.

01:06:59.932 --> 01:07:03.893
Female reporter:... at city hall, though
we are unable to confirm the details,

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:06.187
we do know that
at least one person is dead

01:07:06.355 --> 01:07:08.481
in what officials are calling
a possible murder.

01:07:08.649 --> 01:07:10.900
We have reporters
on the ground...

01:07:11.068 --> 01:07:12.318
Up.

01:07:17.408 --> 01:07:19.242
Somebody's helping this guy-

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.661
a bomb in that phone,
and she doesn't know about it.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.789
Who had access?

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:26.666
Are you okay?

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:29.502
I've survived the war
and two ex-wives. I'll be fine.

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:33.339
How are you holding up?

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:35.800
I'm good.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:53.359
So you're killing judges now?

01:07:53.527 --> 01:07:57.655
In my experience, Nick, lessons not
learned in blood are soon forgotten.

01:07:57.823 --> 01:08:00.450
And vengeance keeps you
warm at night.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:02.619
Vengeance?

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:07.332
That's what you think this is about?
Vengeance?

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.167
What else could it be?

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:13.588
No, Nick, I had 10 years
for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:17.383
You don't think that I watch you
go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:21.470
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise
to schooI, 8:15?

01:08:21.639 --> 01:08:25.390
No, I could have slaughtered you
or your family anytime I wanted!

01:08:25.559 --> 01:08:28.269
You even think about
touching my family-

01:08:28.437 --> 01:08:31.981
you even think about touching
my family...

01:08:40.323 --> 01:08:42.617
I do my job.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:45.161
I'm the best at it.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.580
- It works.
- You were doing yourjob

01:08:47.747 --> 01:08:52.042
the way that best served you, Nick-
the way that best served you.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:55.462
- That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.174
You at war with the whole world?
It's not gonna bring anybody back.

01:08:58.341 --> 01:09:01.636
No, I'm at war with this-

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.848
this- this broken thing-

01:09:05.015 --> 01:09:07.058
this thing that brought
you and I together.

01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.644
This broken thing works
for people that are sane.

01:09:09.812 --> 01:09:12.188
You think doing what you're doing
is gonna change anything?

01:09:12.356 --> 01:09:14.858
You and whoever else
you have helping you

01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:17.026
are gonna pay.

01:09:18.696 --> 01:09:20.822
I don't think you
have any idea

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.533
who's helping me
or what I'm doing.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:24.826
It's a matter of time.

01:09:24.993 --> 01:09:27.245
See, you see the bodies,
you see the smoke,

01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:30.456
but the larger picture
still eludes you.

01:09:30.624 --> 01:09:32.709
Do tell.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.921
I would like to...

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:38.923
but I would rather show you.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:45.013
I still have faith in you,
so I'm gonna give you one last chance.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.514
Here's the deal:

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:51.102
release me and drop
all charges by 6:00 AM.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:54.022
- 6:00 AM, Nick.
- Or what?

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:59.569
Or I kill everyone.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:12.665
- Hello?
- Yeah, Sarah,

01:10:12.833 --> 01:10:15.835
he has to have an accomplice-
probably somebody inside the prison.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:19.339
We have to go through all the prisoners'
files to find some sort of connection.

01:10:19.506 --> 01:10:21.216
Do you want the files
brought to the office?

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:24.594
No, there isn't time. Get everybody
together and bring them to the prison.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:26.221
We're moving in.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:46.574
Stop looking at your watch.

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:50.453
Anything from your friend?

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:52.247
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:55.375
We can't access anything about
specific property holdings,

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:57.418
but my friend found
this tiny loophole

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.797
that grants us access to
Clyde's corporate expenses.

01:11:00.965 --> 01:11:02.465
Does that help?

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:10.723
So we match sale prices
of industrial properties sold in Philly

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:13.601
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:17.105
Okay, I got it.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:28.866
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

01:11:31.787 --> 01:11:33.997
Would you do it
the same way now?

01:11:34.164 --> 01:11:36.666
Would you still cut
a deal for Darby?

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:42.380
This is the job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:46.384
- But did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice, right?

01:11:48.929 --> 01:11:51.222
I don't know.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.808
I'm 35, Nick.

01:11:53.976 --> 01:11:55.935
And there are things-
there are possibilities

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:57.854
that I'm not gonna have now.

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:02.942
And it's okay.
I know it's part of the deal.

01:12:04.778 --> 01:12:07.947
And don't get me wrong.
I love working for you.

01:12:12.494 --> 01:12:14.954
But I just want to make sure
I gave up those things

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:18.541
for more than just
a high conviction rate.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:40.229
Do you want any more coffee?

01:12:40.397 --> 01:12:41.647
No.

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.831
All right.

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:42.333
All right, let's just get focused here.
This guy's not God.

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.919
He's not the All Powerful.
He's just well-prepared.

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:47.088
We need to be equally
well-prepared.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:50.967
Take a couple of hours, go home,
come back. We'll get a fresh start.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:52.510
Okay?

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:06.357
Come on, old man, let's see if
we can find you some breakfast.

01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:23.458
Hey, Nick, get some rest.

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:27.962
Give Chester my regards.
When do I get to meet him?

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.382
Oh, he's not ready for that.

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.177
'Night, Jonas.

01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:47.773
I don't know how
this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

01:14:47.941 --> 01:14:49.942
We're gonna stop him.
That's how it's gonna turn out.

01:14:51.612 --> 01:15:02.038
Ahh!

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.916
Sarah.

01:15:10.547 --> 01:15:12.006
Sarah.

01:15:45.415 --> 01:15:48.960
In the past 48 hours, six
officials from the Justice Department

01:15:49.127 --> 01:15:52.421
have been killed in a series of vicious
and premeditated attacks.

01:15:52.589 --> 01:15:55.258
This marks the first time in
the history of the United States

01:15:55.425 --> 01:15:58.302
where government officials have been,
by all appearances,

01:15:58.470 --> 01:16:00.429
systematically murdered.

01:16:00.597 --> 01:16:03.432
We'll continue to follow this story and
bring you up-to-the-minute details...

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:10.439
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now,
but we've got something here.

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:13.317
Found this right outside the wall-

01:16:13.485 --> 01:16:15.278
radio beacon-

01:16:15.445 --> 01:16:18.155
sent an arming signal to the car bombs
when they went through the gate.

01:16:18.323 --> 01:16:20.908
Security said they checked
every car before anybody got in them.

01:16:21.076 --> 01:16:24.370
They didn't check the gas tanks.
That's where the clever prick put 'em.

01:16:24.538 --> 01:16:26.247
Real precise stuff too.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.332
Could have taken out
a lot more if he wanted to.

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:31.294
- What about Nick's car?
- That's the weird thing.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:34.046
It's clean-
hadn't been touched.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:37.300
I gotta go.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.892
Jesus Christ.

01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.570
Privacy, please.

01:16:59.364 --> 01:17:02.408
So let me get this straight:

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:05.494
not only do we
know who did it,

01:17:05.662 --> 01:17:09.749
we have him locked up
and he's still killing people?

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:15.296
You boys sure
fucked this one up.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:19.550
The press is gonna kill us.

01:17:19.718 --> 01:17:21.344
Can someone explain this to me?

01:17:21.511 --> 01:17:23.220
We can't yet.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:31.812
How did this get away
from you, Jonas?

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:34.190
It's complicated, April.

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:36.776
He's very smart.
He's very angry.

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:39.570
We assume he has an accomplice
helping him on the outside.

01:17:39.738 --> 01:17:43.366
I'm not having
this conversation.

01:17:43.533 --> 01:17:47.078
I don't care how smart he is
or who's helping him.

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:56.337
We'll release a statement saying we
have suspects, we're following leads-

01:17:56.505 --> 01:17:59.382
- nothing alarming.
- Mayor, you have my word,

01:17:59.549 --> 01:18:03.636
we are gonna stop this guy.
He's not gonna hurt anybody else.

01:18:08.308 --> 01:18:11.018
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

01:18:15.357 --> 01:18:17.817
Get this situation
under control, gentlemen.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:36.252
Dad?

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.754
I bet you don't remember
when I did that.

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:41.340
I bet you I do.

01:18:56.356 --> 01:18:58.149
What?

01:18:58.316 --> 01:19:00.025
Nothing.

01:19:00.193 --> 01:19:03.487
You and your mother are going away
on a little vacation, that's all.

01:19:03.655 --> 01:19:05.239
- You like vacations, right?
- Yeah.

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:07.283
Good.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.160
But why?

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:11.495
Why not now?

01:19:11.663 --> 01:19:13.831
Okay.

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:16.834
Don't need an excuse, right?

01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:21.672
All right.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.801
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers- just cash.

01:19:25.969 --> 01:19:27.553
Daddy, are you coming?

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:30.598
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:33.100
- Of course I am.
- You'd better, Nick.

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.566
It was first grade, hmm?

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:42.902
Your mother helped you
with the spelling.

01:19:43.069 --> 01:19:45.237
It was my birthday.

01:19:45.405 --> 01:19:48.199
- We need to go!
- Let's go.

01:19:48.366 --> 01:19:50.034
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:52.536
- Love you, Daddy.
- Love you too.

01:19:57.417 --> 01:19:59.960
- Nick, your phone lines are clear.
- Good.

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:03.172
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with.
You're good.

01:21:51.448 --> 01:21:53.616
You should have taken my deal.

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:02.583
That's six fucking innocent people.
Is that how you want to play it? Huh?

01:22:02.751 --> 01:22:05.669
It's okay.
It's okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:08.589
That's good. That's what it takes.
That's how it has to be.

01:22:08.757 --> 01:22:10.424
What if I said you was right
and I was wrong?

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:13.385
What if I had said, "Well,
let's take them to trial"? Huh?

01:22:13.553 --> 01:22:15.179
Then I would say
you're making progress.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:18.557
And we might have lost!
And Ames and Darby would both go free.

01:22:18.725 --> 01:22:21.185
Don't you get that?

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:22.603
Fuck.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.980
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

01:22:25.148 --> 01:22:27.858
You could have walked out of
that courtroom with your head held high.

01:22:28.026 --> 01:22:29.777
I could have lived with that, Nick.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.737
I keep my head up.

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:35.699
And you will end this.

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:39.620
I'm just getting warmed up.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:42.539
This is Von Clausewitz shit-
total fucking war.

01:22:42.707 --> 01:22:44.625
You fuck.

01:22:49.923 --> 01:22:51.340
No.

01:23:00.558 --> 01:23:03.602
I'm gonna pull
the whole thing down.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:06.730
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased, corrupt temple

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:09.358
down on your head.

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:12.111
It's gonna be Biblical.

01:23:29.504 --> 01:23:32.631
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:36.010
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:40.723
Absolutely not.

01:23:42.934 --> 01:23:45.436
You don't actually believe that,
do you?

01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:52.735
Gentlemen? Sorry,
but we need to get going

01:23:52.902 --> 01:23:55.320
if we're going to make it
to the press conference.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:07.207
I want to read you something
from my speech before we go.

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:12.379
"We must not give in
to the fear.

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:15.299
We must face
those things we fear the most.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:17.801
We must appeaI
to our better angels."

01:24:17.969 --> 01:24:19.928
Too much?

01:24:20.096 --> 01:24:22.014
I'm sorry.

01:24:22.182 --> 01:24:25.768
It's just before, when you asked
if we brought this on ourselves-

01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:28.020
we didn't.

01:24:28.188 --> 01:24:29.772
I did.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:35.944
When I was young,
I really wanted to change the system.

01:24:36.112 --> 01:24:40.783
You know, I was ready to fight.
I was gonna be the best no matter what.

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:43.160
You give an inch here,
you give an inch there,

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.996
you get caught up
in the game.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:49.666
And then you realize that the system
that you're trying to change-

01:24:49.834 --> 01:24:52.336
it changed you.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.421
Jonas, I've lost my way
somewhere.

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:57.091
Look, remember what I told you?

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:00.928
The hard part isn't
making the decision.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:05.015
It's living with it.

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:11.396
Everybody stay sharp.

01:25:11.564 --> 01:25:13.148
We're on the move.

01:26:33.938 --> 01:26:35.939
- We all right?
- It's dead.

01:26:36.107 --> 01:26:37.941
Electrical system's fried.

01:26:38.109 --> 01:26:40.360
What's going on back there?

01:26:43.406 --> 01:26:45.574
Dunnigan, tell them to
get Jonas away from here.

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:56.251
What the fuck is that?

01:26:58.630 --> 01:26:59.880
Get down, get down!

01:27:24.155 --> 01:27:26.573
Jonas! Jonas!

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:29.201
- Jonas! Jonas!
- No, Nick! Get back!

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.996
Jonas! Get your hands off me!

01:27:33.164 --> 01:27:35.832
Jonas! Get out of the car!
Jonas!

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.085
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:39.670
Please listen to me!

01:27:46.719 --> 01:27:48.262
Jonas!

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:50.222
Jonas.

01:28:10.743 --> 01:28:13.578
I told you to handle this.

01:28:13.746 --> 01:28:15.747
You didn't.

01:28:15.915 --> 01:28:17.416
Now we have a jailed psychopath

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:21.003
that's managed to bring this
entire city to its knees.

01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:24.881
One of my friends
was just murdered.

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:29.636
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.556
What I should do is fire you.

01:28:32.724 --> 01:28:35.183
Hmm?
Right now.

01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:39.062
I resign.

01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:43.275
- Is that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

01:28:48.197 --> 01:28:49.781
No.

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:53.118
I'm not gonna allow that to happen.
Bring me the Bible.

01:28:53.286 --> 01:28:57.706
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide
whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.292
As of now, you're acting
District Attorney.

01:29:00.460 --> 01:29:03.462
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:06.840
For now this will suffice.
Stand up.

01:29:08.551 --> 01:29:11.011
Put your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:13.013
Repeat after me.

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:15.140
- I, Nicolas Rice...
- I, Nicolas Rice...

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:17.351
- ...do solemnly swear...
- ...do solemnly swear...

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.311
- ...that I will support...
- ...that I will support...

01:29:19.479 --> 01:29:20.562
- ...obey...
- ...obey...

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:23.398
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

01:29:23.566 --> 01:29:25.442
...and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:28.570
...and the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.374
People aren't going to work;
kids aren't going to schooI.

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:43.001
They're scared,
and I don't blame them.

01:29:43.169 --> 01:29:47.381
So I'm implementing the emergency
provision of the Philadelphia code.

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:48.840
We're gonna lock this city down.

01:29:49.008 --> 01:29:52.177
Starting now, no one moves
in this city unrestricted.

01:29:52.637 --> 01:29:54.971
I want a show of force
for the public-

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:57.724
uniforms, detectives,
12-hour shifts.

01:29:57.892 --> 01:29:59.768
Put an armed cop on every corner.

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:02.562
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:04.815
There should be no doubt
in people's minds

01:30:04.982 --> 01:30:08.276
that this city is secure
and under our control.

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.989
Okay.

01:30:18.538 --> 01:30:22.207
Okay, Clyde.
I get it.

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.005
Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:32.426
it was a weaponized
bomb-disposal robot.

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:33.635
Can you believe that?

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:36.721
Damn thing had video, night vision-
you name it.

01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:40.016
It's like military APl,
for Christ's sakes.

01:30:40.184 --> 01:30:43.061
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:45.147
I think he's saving you for last.

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:50.193
Nick, I'm serious.

01:30:51.863 --> 01:30:54.781
I appreciate the insight.

01:30:58.453 --> 01:31:01.872
Nick, you gotta get in front of
this guy if you want to stay alive.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.751
I may have a way-

01:31:06.919 --> 01:31:10.505
something a friend
is helping me out with.

01:31:10.673 --> 01:31:12.048
Who's your friend?

01:31:12.216 --> 01:31:14.843
A friend named Chester.
I'll call you back.

01:31:16.637 --> 01:31:18.889
Thank you, Sarah.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:29.024
This is Nick.
Give me the real-estate listing

01:31:29.192 --> 01:31:32.611
of every industrial property sold
here in the last 10 years.

01:31:58.137 --> 01:32:00.555
Motherfucker.

01:32:18.908 --> 01:32:20.700
You're kidding me, right?

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:24.120
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

01:32:24.288 --> 01:32:27.207
Something about it
sticks out, right?

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.292
Yeah.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:35.632
What- are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:40.387
- What about his civil rights?
- Fuck his civiI rights.

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:45.225
Yes!

01:33:30.187 --> 01:33:32.606
There's got to be
something in here.

01:33:32.773 --> 01:33:34.482
Yeah.

01:33:50.207 --> 01:33:52.834
Remember this from
outside the house?

01:33:59.759 --> 01:34:01.343
Yeah.

01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:03.386
Get that right there.

01:34:19.987 --> 01:34:22.697
Un-fucking-believable.

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:38.630
Look at this.

01:34:43.928 --> 01:34:45.804
Watch your step.

01:34:51.143 --> 01:34:53.770
This guy tunneled into prison?

01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:23.758
Oh, shit.

01:35:28.681 --> 01:35:30.682
Fuck- Semtex.

01:35:34.937 --> 01:35:38.565
Got police uniforms,
other disguises.

01:36:02.173 --> 01:36:04.215
He tunneled into every cell.

01:36:05.217 --> 01:36:06.926
Over here.

01:36:13.267 --> 01:36:15.810
He wanted to be
transferred to solitary.

01:36:15.978 --> 01:36:18.688
Surprise, motherfucker.

01:37:01.607 --> 01:37:04.734
- He's not here!
- If he's not there, then where is he?

01:37:10.449 --> 01:37:12.075
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

01:37:12.243 --> 01:37:13.743
Oh, long story.

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:16.871
Stop right there, sir.

01:37:17.039 --> 01:37:19.165
Let me see your ID, please.

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.376
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:24.087
Turn around, sir.
Extend your arms.

01:37:25.798 --> 01:37:27.423
Something going on tonight?

01:37:27.591 --> 01:37:31.010
- The mayor.
- Mmm, mayor.

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.520
Look at this.

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.147
He tapped into the prison cameras.

01:37:43.315 --> 01:37:45.400
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

01:37:45.568 --> 01:37:47.318
- Shit.
- Is that your house?

01:37:47.486 --> 01:37:50.321
Yes.

01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:53.783
Baby, please tell me you're okay.

01:37:53.951 --> 01:37:55.410
Denise- where is she?

01:37:55.578 --> 01:37:57.287
Is she with you?
Are you sure?

01:37:57.454 --> 01:37:59.205
Okay.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.833
Stay where you are.
I'll explain later.

01:38:02.001 --> 01:38:03.835
I love you.

01:38:13.846 --> 01:38:16.055
Von Clausewitz.

01:38:20.561 --> 01:38:22.103
Look at that.

01:38:29.486 --> 01:38:31.279
He's at City Hall.

01:38:32.781 --> 01:38:34.824
You're free to go, sir.

01:38:34.992 --> 01:38:37.994
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- No, don't worry about it.

01:38:39.413 --> 01:38:42.040
Better to be safe
than sorry, right?

01:38:43.500 --> 01:38:45.543
Get ready to evacuate the building.

01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:47.712
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.130
Bad idea.
Have them come in soft.

01:38:49.298 --> 01:38:51.966
If Shelton spots them or
any of us, we're fucked.

01:39:15.741 --> 01:39:18.034
Hey.

01:39:20.579 --> 01:39:22.205
- Where's the tactical team?
- En route.

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:24.582
- They're coming in soft- no sirens.
- Bomb squad?

01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:26.292
You're looking at it.

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:29.754
Right, okay. We take the north surge;
you take the west.

01:39:29.922 --> 01:39:31.339
We'll call.

01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:37.971
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- IDs, please.

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:40.556
- He's the fucking DA.
- Good for him. IDs, please.

01:39:40.724 --> 01:39:42.725
What's going on here tonight?

01:39:42.893 --> 01:39:45.103
- Security meeting with all the brass.
- What floor?

01:39:45.270 --> 01:39:47.188
6th floor- caucus room.

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:53.861
- What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, sir.

01:39:54.029 --> 01:39:56.072
Directly below the caucus room.

01:39:56.240 --> 01:39:59.993
You catch this motherfucker red-handed,
we gotta take him alive.

01:40:22.099 --> 01:40:23.933
Where is he?

01:40:24.101 --> 01:40:26.686
What the fuck are we looking for?

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:28.938
Wait wait wait.

01:40:29.106 --> 01:40:30.314
Right there.

01:40:30.482 --> 01:40:33.192
Stand back.
Don't touch anything.

01:40:34.486 --> 01:40:37.238
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

01:41:16.236 --> 01:41:18.237
Can I see your ID, please?

01:41:25.287 --> 01:41:27.663
All right, next car, pull forward!

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:05.743
Malglinite.

01:42:05.911 --> 01:42:08.412
That's napalm, basically.
This shit'll take out the entire floor

01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:10.414
and the one above us.

01:42:10.582 --> 01:42:14.585
Looks like it's- looks like it's
triggered by this cell phone here.

01:42:14.753 --> 01:42:18.881
What?
So an incoming call arms it?

01:42:19.049 --> 01:42:23.010
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
till boom time.

01:42:24.012 --> 01:42:26.305
- Jesus.
- Dunnigan, what are you doing?

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:28.141
- I'm calling the mayor's security.
- We can't.

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:31.686
Clyde is watching. He sees him evacuate
and he will detonate this thing.

01:42:31.854 --> 01:42:34.480
We don't tell the mayor anything.

01:42:37.067 --> 01:42:39.235
So what do we do?

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.247
Wait a second.

01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:53.291
We've got something.

01:42:53.458 --> 01:42:55.293
He's pulling up.

01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:19.483
Mayor April Henry.

01:43:29.077 --> 01:43:31.746
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

01:43:38.462 --> 01:43:39.921
I have one simple question.

01:43:42.382 --> 01:43:45.384
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

01:43:47.346 --> 01:43:49.472
Now I refuse to believe

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.060
that one man is smarter
than Homeland Security,

01:43:54.228 --> 01:43:58.648
the FBl, the sheriff's department,
or Philly PD.

01:43:58.815 --> 01:44:01.067
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:04.487
of obscure legaI justification
we have to invoke, gentlemen.

01:44:04.655 --> 01:44:07.698
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

01:44:07.866 --> 01:44:11.786
I am sure that there is a provision
of the Homeland Security Act

01:44:11.954 --> 01:44:14.538
that we can activate.

01:44:14.706 --> 01:44:17.833
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

01:44:24.549 --> 01:44:26.050
Clyde?

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:32.682
Nick.

01:44:32.849 --> 01:44:34.767
I wasn't expecting company.

01:44:38.188 --> 01:44:41.315
Yeah, I would have-
I would have cleaned up a little.

01:44:41.483 --> 01:44:44.277
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before.

01:44:50.075 --> 01:44:54.036
And the solitary confinement?
That was clever.

01:44:54.204 --> 01:44:56.539
Well, that's how winners play.

01:44:56.707 --> 01:44:59.875
We convince the other guy
he's making all the right moves.

01:45:00.877 --> 01:45:03.379
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

01:45:03.547 --> 01:45:05.214
Yeah, I did.

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:07.758
It's the end of the road
for you now.

01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:14.765
You played us, Clyde.
You played us real good.

01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:16.809
Thank you.

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:20.021
You know, I'm glad you finally
get to appreciate

01:45:20.188 --> 01:45:22.106
some of the effort that
I put into all of this.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:24.525
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

01:45:24.693 --> 01:45:25.776
You made it.

01:45:25.944 --> 01:45:27.653
No, people still don't get it.

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:31.574
They don't appreciate what I'm trying
to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

01:45:31.742 --> 01:45:33.617
A man I cared about
once told me

01:45:33.785 --> 01:45:35.953
that we can't retract
the decisions that we've made,

01:45:36.121 --> 01:45:38.664
we can only affect the decisions
we're going to make from here.

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:41.625
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick?
- I'm giving you a way out.

01:45:41.793 --> 01:45:43.419
Big difference.

01:45:43.587 --> 01:45:45.671
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching.

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:49.425
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde.
That includes you.

01:45:49.593 --> 01:45:51.260
Why don't we do
the right thing here?

01:45:52.262 --> 01:45:54.764
I'm doing the right thing, Nick.

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:58.434
You just have to see it that way.

01:45:58.602 --> 01:45:59.977
By murdering all those people,

01:46:00.145 --> 01:46:02.980
all you're doing is
destroying the memory of your daughter

01:46:03.148 --> 01:46:06.692
and causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

01:46:13.408 --> 01:46:17.828
So what do you suggest, Nick?
Make another deaI?

01:46:17.996 --> 01:46:21.082
One finaI offer?
Is that what it is?

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:27.713
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

01:46:27.881 --> 01:46:29.882
You taught me that.

01:46:34.429 --> 01:46:38.140
Finally.

01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:42.895
Well done. Bravo.

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:46.023
Maybe I wasn't such
a bad teacher after all.

01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:48.401
If you go through with this, Clyde,
it's a decision

01:46:48.568 --> 01:46:51.153
you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.

01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:16.887
I'm sorry, Nick.

01:47:19.558 --> 01:47:21.475
Me too.

01:47:31.653 --> 01:47:33.529
Like I said, Clyde,

01:47:33.697 --> 01:47:36.657
it's a decision you'll have to
live with for the rest of your life,

01:47:36.825 --> 01:47:40.161
which I figure by now
is about 25 more seconds.

01:51:10.205 --> 01:51:12.748
# Ain't seen a night #

01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:15.584
# Things work out right #

01:51:15.752 --> 01:51:19.129
# Go by #

01:51:21.257 --> 01:51:23.634
# Things on my mind #

01:51:23.802 --> 01:51:26.261
# And I just don't have the time #

01:51:26.429 --> 01:51:29.890
# And it don't seem right #

01:51:32.644 --> 01:51:34.728
# Ain't seen a day #

01:51:34.896 --> 01:51:37.690
# That I don't hear people say #

01:51:37.857 --> 01:51:40.943
# They know they're gonna die #

01:51:43.988 --> 01:51:46.865
# This may seem a little bit crazy #

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:51.245
# But I don't think you
should be so lazy #

01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:57.710
# If you think
you've heard this before #

01:51:57.877 --> 01:51:59.712
# Well, stick around #

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:03.590
# I'm gonna tell you more #

01:53:30.178 --> 01:53:33.013
# One just like the other #

01:53:33.181 --> 01:53:35.140
# Sin's a good man's brother #

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:39.019
# But is that right? #

01:53:41.439 --> 01:53:43.941
# You tell me that I don't #

01:53:44.108 --> 01:53:46.318
# Then I say I won't #

01:53:46.486 --> 01:53:50.239
# But then I might #

01:53:52.951 --> 01:53:55.661
# You said this is the way
it's supposed to be #

01:53:55.829 --> 01:53:58.330
# But it just don't seem
right to me #

01:53:58.498 --> 01:54:02.459
# And that's outta sight #

01:54:04.045 --> 01:54:06.964
# Some folks need an education #

01:54:07.131 --> 01:54:11.510
# Don't give up
or we'll lose the nation #

01:54:15.431 --> 01:54:18.183
# You say we need a revolution? #

01:54:18.351 --> 01:54:19.685
# It seems to be #

01:54:19.853 --> 01:54:23.814
# The only solution. #
