WEBVTT

00:00.066 --> 00:01.900
Dr. Masters:
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:01.902 --> 00:05.871
Because I wasn't sure
when I'd be starting
at memorial,

00:05.873 --> 00:06.739
I haven't yet told lillian.

00:06.741 --> 00:11.944
Greathouse feels
it may not be possible
for you to come to memorial.

00:11.946 --> 00:12.611
Great to see you, bill.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.213
I hope you're
treating him right,
barbara.

00:14.215 --> 00:17.282
Because he's got
a bigger following
than  <i>gunsmoke.</i>

00:17.284 --> 00:19.585
You, my dear,
are not married
to a saint.

00:19.587 --> 00:22.554
You are to keep 100 miles
away from that study.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.023
Unofficially,
I'm very interested

00:24.025 --> 00:26.859
In what happens
behind closed doors.

00:26.861 --> 00:27.693
Very, very interested.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.029
Metastasis was
always a possibility.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.964
I know what
to research now.

00:31.966 --> 00:34.433
I'm going to have to
hand the work off

00:34.435 --> 00:35.801
<i>To someone who</i>
<i>can fight the fight.</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:39.738
You're sterile,
yet engaging in
fertility treatments?

00:39.740 --> 00:40.539
It's not my problem.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.841
Betty:  <i>Last I looked,</i>
<i>your job came with</i>
<i>all the zeroes</i>

00:42.843 --> 00:44.510
<i>On that cheque</i>
<i>my husband wrote.</i>

00:44.512 --> 00:46.745
Elise:  <i>Attention</i>
<i>all hospital staff.</i>

00:46.747 --> 00:47.913
<i>Dr. Austin langham</i>

00:47.915 --> 00:49.515
<i>Has spent the</i>
<i>last two months</i>

00:49.517 --> 00:52.284
<i>Fornicating with</i>
<i>his sister-in-law.</i>

00:52.286 --> 00:54.953
Thought he would
do the trick.
Having our son.

00:54.955 --> 00:57.856
I know my husband
was reticent
about children.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.793
Who ever heard
of a grown man being
afraid of his child?

01:00.795 --> 01:03.462
I think you've misunderstood
what happened between us.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.864
Of course we're not
having an affair, virginia.

01:05.866 --> 01:08.000
We never were.
I'm a happily married man.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.802
Continuing the
work's a good idea,

01:09.804 --> 01:13.772
Only if you
understand the terms.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.441
I agree.

02:01.654 --> 02:04.656
If sex is merely
a vehicle for
procreation,

02:04.658 --> 02:06.191
Then the
end of fertility

02:06.193 --> 02:07.559
Marks the end
of sexual desire.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.595
Yet freud
believed that
menopause

02:09.597 --> 02:11.396
Led to an increase
in female libido.

02:11.398 --> 02:14.566
As usual,
dr. Freud presents
no empirical evidence

02:14.568 --> 02:16.034
To substantiate
his claim.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.337
He wasn't all wrong, though.
The data does show

02:18.339 --> 02:21.974
Certain physiological
changes in women
over 50.

02:21.976 --> 02:24.810
A longer period of foreplay
needed for lubrication,

02:24.812 --> 02:28.514
Fewer vaginal contractions
in the orgasm phase.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.816
When did you see
all these participants?

02:30.818 --> 02:33.385
Oh, those are
only a small sampling.

02:34.654 --> 02:36.522
So you've
resumed the study.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.656
Yes, of course.
Without me.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.690
I did everything
I could, virginia.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.094
The board just wasn't
impressed by
your application.

02:42.462 --> 02:43.629
I don't understand.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.597
Well, try to see it
from their perspective.

02:45.599 --> 02:48.267
Limited experience,
no higher education...

02:48.269 --> 02:49.401
I tried to
go back to school...

02:49.403 --> 02:53.205
You tried,
but didn't see it through.
You chose me instead.

02:53.207 --> 02:53.972
I chose the work.

02:53.974 --> 02:57.009
Virginia, you thought
it was about the work.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.577
I always knew the truth.

02:58.579 --> 03:01.880
That became apparent
on the application, so...

03:01.882 --> 03:06.018
I'm sorry,
but you really only
have yourself to blame.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.152
Because?

03:07.154 --> 03:08.020
For starters?

03:08.022 --> 03:12.090
Under "current
occupation,"
you wrote

03:12.092 --> 03:13.859
"mistress."

03:22.936 --> 03:25.304
Dr. Masters:
You're up.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.273
How long was I...

03:28.275 --> 03:30.008
An hour maybe.
An hour?

03:30.010 --> 03:30.842
Why didn't you
wake me?

03:30.844 --> 03:33.812
You looked like
you needed
the sleep.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.515
Did you know you
sleep with your
mouth open,

03:36.517 --> 03:37.249
Like a baby bird?

03:37.251 --> 03:40.252
We don't sleep here.
Or read.

03:40.254 --> 03:41.753
This isn't a vacation.

03:41.755 --> 03:44.723
I told the sitter
I'd be home
by 10:00.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.525
It's only 9:15. We...

03:46.527 --> 03:47.659
Please get dressed.

03:47.661 --> 03:51.363
You need to
get the study files
out of my trunk.

03:56.703 --> 03:57.836
<i>Oh, goodbye, silky.</i>

03:57.838 --> 04:01.573
<i>And don't wait for me</i>
<i>to write another</i>
<i>story about you.</i>

04:01.575 --> 04:02.908
<i>Drop in any time.</i>

04:02.910 --> 04:05.110
Man:  <i>Goodbye,</i>
<i>mr. Thompson.</i>

04:05.112 --> 04:08.981
<i>Ain't you going to</i>
<i>escort me to the door?</i>

04:09.249 --> 04:10.949
(laughing)

04:15.688 --> 04:19.057
Man: (on tv)  <i>mr. Thompson,</i>
<i>my wife didn't</i>
<i>mean anything.</i>

04:19.059 --> 04:21.460
<i>We've been</i>
<i>married for 25 years.</i>

04:21.462 --> 04:23.395
<i>You're not</i>
<i>going to shoot me.</i>

04:23.397 --> 04:24.396
Mr. Thompson:
<i>Why should I?</i>

04:24.398 --> 04:27.866
<i>If you want</i>
<i>to get out of it,</i>
<i>shoot yourself.</i>

04:46.486 --> 04:47.953
(elevator dings)

04:59.599 --> 05:00.999
(sighs) it's a mess,
but it's all there.

05:01.001 --> 05:05.137
Intake forms,
instrument readings,
sexual histories.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.805
Oh, I could've used these
the other day.

05:06.807 --> 05:11.943
Barbara tried to
make fliers for the study.
Riddled with typos.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.145
Any response yet?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.279
Well, the phone
hasn't stopped
still ringing.

05:14.281 --> 05:18.483
I have seven interviews
with prospective
participants tomorrow,

05:18.485 --> 05:19.151
Six the next day...

05:19.153 --> 05:21.320
I meant any response
from greathouse

05:21.322 --> 05:23.855
About my position
in the study.

05:24.524 --> 05:25.090
Uh...

05:25.092 --> 05:30.262
Why, he can't authorize
me to hire you until
the board signs off.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.597
Has he brought
it up to them?

05:32.599 --> 05:35.067
I'm going to
make sure he does.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.570
Pull your car around
so that we can start
loading these.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.604
Maybe you should
hold on to them.

05:39.606 --> 05:43.442
Someone has to put them
into some kind of order.

05:43.444 --> 05:46.978
I was under the impression,
that someone was
called your secretary.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.046
Oh, barbara can
barely alphabetize.

05:48.048 --> 05:53.018
Besides, you know better
than anyone how all
the pieces fit together.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.253
I want you
to stay connected
to the work.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.856
So I'm not qualified
as a researcher,

05:57.858 --> 06:02.160
But it's fine for me
to play secretary
in my free time?

06:02.162 --> 06:05.597
Virginia, I'm as unhappy
with the situation
as you are.

06:05.599 --> 06:10.035
Are you taking
diet pills?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.036
I'm selling them.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.704
Holding on to
them for a friend?

06:12.706 --> 06:15.140
No. I am selling them.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.675
Without extra money
from the study,

06:16.677 --> 06:18.877
I can barely afford
to pay my rent.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.847
I need to make
a living, bill.

06:40.066 --> 06:43.068
This morning,
we're driving in,

06:43.070 --> 06:44.803
And the parking
attendant says,

06:44.805 --> 06:45.704
"'morning, mrs. Moretti,"

06:45.706 --> 06:50.609
And it takes me
a solid minute to
realize he meant me.

06:50.611 --> 06:54.913
Your whole life you're
walking around
as betty dimello,

06:54.915 --> 06:55.914
The next day,
you're married,

06:55.916 --> 06:58.917
And someone's calling you
some other lady's name.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.652
It's like if,
all of a sudden,

07:00.654 --> 07:04.556
I started calling
you dr. Lipschitz.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.158
Mrs. Moretti.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.195
It makes me feel
like I'm pretending
to be somebody I'm not.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.464
Know what I mean?

07:12.899 --> 07:14.900
(elevator dinging)

07:17.837 --> 07:20.906
Libby: They had
a free subscription offer,
so I figured, why not?

07:20.908 --> 07:24.142
Then I stumbled
upon this article.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.646
Turns out a new baby
is traumatic for a man.

07:27.648 --> 07:31.716
Like his home has been
transformed into
an oversized playpen.

07:31.718 --> 07:35.821
It's messy, it's noisy,
there are smells.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.089
Which explains
why the moment bill
walks in through the door,

07:38.091 --> 07:41.092
The first thing he does
is take out the diaper pail.

07:41.094 --> 07:46.131
It also explains
why bill needs
things calm at home.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.666
Orderly.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.300
Unchanged.

07:48.302 --> 07:53.071
No bottles on the counters.
No pacifiers stuck
between cushions.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.639
It's also
why today
is important.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.741
I mean, I know,
it seems like
a silly luncheon,

07:56.743 --> 08:00.178
But they're
the wives of
bill's new colleagues.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.214
If things go well here,

08:02.216 --> 08:05.016
They report as much
back to their husbands,

08:05.018 --> 08:09.020
And that helps bill at work,
as well as at home.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.190
Is that
a dixie cup on his...

08:12.192 --> 08:15.260
It's a trick I learned
changing my brothers' diapers.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.896
You lose your eyes
if you aren't
careful with boys.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.164
(laughs)

08:19.166 --> 08:21.533
Maybe I should've aksed
before I put it on.

08:21.535 --> 08:23.902
"asked" me
before you put it on.

08:23.904 --> 08:27.105
We talked
about this before,
remember?

08:27.107 --> 08:29.941
Don't worry.
You'll get it.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.577
(cooing)

08:33.613 --> 08:35.247
We should have
a sample pap smear kit

08:35.249 --> 08:37.482
For dr. Papanicolaou
to bring to florida with him.

08:37.484 --> 08:40.552
I put one together
last week.

08:41.420 --> 08:43.154
Several sample kits.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.624
At least three or four.
Even to be safe.

08:45.626 --> 08:48.560
Four seems reasonable,
don't you think?

08:48.562 --> 08:52.264
He's only in st louis once
a year for the conference.

08:52.266 --> 08:55.066
Does he prefer
coffee or tea?

08:55.068 --> 08:55.600
Tea.

08:55.602 --> 08:59.571
With cream and a little...
With the little...

09:00.172 --> 09:02.407
The little squares
of sugar.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.309
Sugar cubes.

09:04.443 --> 09:07.546
You're just
nervous about
tomorrow.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.515
They did name
the pap smear after
dr. Papanicolaou after all.

09:10.517 --> 09:13.218
It makes sense you'd
want to impress him.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.854
I'm not trying
to impress anyone.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.822
Dr. Papanicolaou happens
to be a respected

09:17.824 --> 09:19.958
Figure in the field,
that's all.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.695
His support for
our program would
be enormously useful.

09:23.697 --> 09:28.199
Especially to you.
As you continue
with our work.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.101
Woman: Depaul?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.770
Lillian?

09:39.545 --> 09:41.346
(whispers)
save my seat.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.590
How long have
you worked here?

10:25.958 --> 10:27.692
Three years in March.

10:27.694 --> 10:28.393
I'm over at maternity.

10:28.395 --> 10:31.529
Oh, my girlfriend peg
used to worked there.
How do you like it?

10:31.531 --> 10:35.867
Truthfully,
the stress of
working in a hospital?

10:35.869 --> 10:39.971
Some days, I want to
curl up with a piece
of chocolate cake.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.172
I know what you mean.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.476
We're supposed to
give these to patients
for nausea.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.111
I can imagine it's tough.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.280
Being surrounded by
so much suffering
every day.

10:49.282 --> 10:52.350
Especially when
everyone's so skinny.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.319
I did try
the grapefruit diet.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.321
All it did was
give me cavities.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.090
That is the problem
with fad diets.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.792
They promise
the moon and stars,

11:00.794 --> 11:03.795
But you end up
hungry all the time.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.766
That's why I started
using cal-o-metric.

11:09.101 --> 11:11.670
Dr. Masters:
We'll be following
the same protocol

11:11.672 --> 11:15.206
As in the study
at washington university.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.108
What would
I tell my husband?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.043
What did you say before?

11:18.045 --> 11:20.578
That there
were two doctors,
one of them a lady.

11:20.580 --> 11:23.815
That's the only reason
he let me do it, dr. Masters.

11:23.817 --> 11:28.720
I'm sorry,
but if it's just going
to be you here, alone.

11:28.954 --> 11:32.357
Watching.
I'm sorry.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.531
Part of the study?
Not anymore.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.266
Oh, shame.
Yes.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.168
Without mrs. Johnson,
we can look forward

11:43.170 --> 11:46.171
To more qualified volunteers
declining to participate.

11:46.173 --> 11:49.941
Mrs. Johnson is instrumental
in this part of the process.

11:49.943 --> 11:52.043
No one else puts people
at their ease...

11:52.045 --> 11:53.078
Bill, I get it.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.780
You and I have
been at this
a long time.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.782
You reach a point
in your career,

11:57.784 --> 11:59.317
Same routine day
in and day out,

11:59.319 --> 12:02.787
If you never see
another torn
perineum again,

12:02.789 --> 12:03.588
It'll be too soon.

12:03.590 --> 12:07.959
So you start a sex study,
get a research assistant.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.595
Mrs. Johnson
is indispensable
to this study...

12:10.597 --> 12:13.832
She may seem
indispensable to you,
but to the board?

12:13.834 --> 12:17.035
She's an
overpriced secretary.

12:17.369 --> 12:19.671
Things aren't always
what they seem.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.606
For instance,
barbara doesn't
seem to know

12:21.608 --> 12:23.441
The first thing about
secretarial work.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.978
And yet, apparently,
she's essential.

12:27.379 --> 12:28.913
To you.

12:29.548 --> 12:33.885
I'm simply asking
mrs. Johnson be
brought onto this study

12:33.887 --> 12:36.855
Because she is essential.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.623
To the work.

12:39.792 --> 12:42.594
I'll float the idea
at tomorrow's
board meeting,

12:42.596 --> 12:44.662
See what they think.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.314
(sighs)

13:07.653 --> 13:08.787
What?

13:08.789 --> 13:10.789
They're out of ambrosia?

13:10.890 --> 13:14.325
You know, last year
when you left the study,

13:14.327 --> 13:16.995
I thought to myself, "why?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.264
"why would virginia
leave the work she loves

13:19.266 --> 13:20.498
"to go back to
typing memos?"

13:20.500 --> 13:23.601
And not to mention,
"why would
bill let her go?"

13:23.603 --> 13:25.470
What are you
talking about, austin?

13:25.472 --> 13:29.541
Now I'm thinking,
"what complicates
every relationship?

13:29.543 --> 13:32.544
"what splits
two people up?"

13:34.246 --> 13:34.779
(clears throat)

13:34.781 --> 13:39.651
Um, elise is now
staying at her mother's
across the river. In alton.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.354
When it's my
turn with the kids,
I drive to alton,

13:43.356 --> 13:45.323
Where I pick them up,
then take them

13:45.325 --> 13:50.094
To the chancery
park plaza hotel.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.864
I saw you
there last night.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.766
With bill.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.435
You should have
said something.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.672
We could have
all gotten a drink.

14:02.641 --> 14:07.745
Bill and I have
decided to go ahead
and publish the study.

14:07.747 --> 14:10.481
Now, it's still in
the early stages.

14:10.483 --> 14:14.319
Compiling the data,
drafting the text.

14:14.321 --> 14:16.287
Bill's not welcome
here, obviously.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.922
I'm not welcome
at his hospital.

14:17.924 --> 14:21.259
We can't work
late hours at his house
with the new baby,

14:21.261 --> 14:23.628
And we can't
discuss sex research

14:23.630 --> 14:25.930
At my house,
with my kids there.

14:25.932 --> 14:28.933
So we work
out of the hotel.

14:28.935 --> 14:32.270
Then why did you two
stop working together?

14:33.639 --> 14:37.575
Bill thought we were ready
to present to the faculty.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.344
And I said
we had not
done enough

14:39.346 --> 14:41.679
To prepare them
for what they were
about to hear,

14:41.681 --> 14:46.851
Let alone the sight
of a pulsating vagina
on a projection screen.

14:46.853 --> 14:52.056
We had a terrible fight,
and in the end, I quit.

14:52.058 --> 14:54.559
And after the debacle
of the presentation,

14:54.561 --> 14:56.127
Bill admitted
that he was wrong,

14:56.129 --> 15:00.298
And he apologized,
and he asked me
to come back.

15:00.699 --> 15:01.933
So that's it?

15:01.935 --> 15:04.135
Yes, that's it.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.005
(chuckles)

15:13.279 --> 15:14.312
And we took
the children to see

15:14.314 --> 15:17.181
<i>The music man</i>
with robert preston.
(all gasping)

15:17.183 --> 15:19.651
Oh, I hear
that is fabulous.

15:19.653 --> 15:20.785
It's fabulous.

15:20.787 --> 15:23.388
Oh, I couldn't drag bill
to a broadway musical.

15:23.390 --> 15:26.024
He'd probably
bring a journal
on uterine fibroids

15:26.026 --> 15:29.627
To read during
the slow parts.
(all laughing)

15:29.629 --> 15:31.329
How does he like
the new hospital?

15:31.331 --> 15:33.064
Oh, he couldn't
be happier.

15:33.066 --> 15:37.368
And that study of his?
Is that still happening, too?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.470
I bet you know
all the secrets.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.706
Libby, do tell us
the most delicious thing

15:41.708 --> 15:44.642
You've learned from
all his experiments.

15:44.644 --> 15:48.046
Uh, well, I actually
worked on the study

15:48.048 --> 15:49.747
Myself for a bit,
in his office.

15:49.749 --> 15:53.384
Where I got to see,
first-hand, just how
boring it all is.

15:53.386 --> 15:58.056
The charts and the graphs,
and the incomprehensible
diagram.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.658
(baby cooing)

16:00.660 --> 16:01.893
Someone had
a nice, long nap.

16:01.895 --> 16:09.000
Oh, my goodness, has
that adorable creature been
here this whole time?

16:09.868 --> 16:12.470
He is gorgeous, libby.

16:13.005 --> 16:15.440
And she is so
wonderful with him.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.909
Can I hold?
Mmm-hmm.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.615
Where did you learn to be
so great with children?

16:24.617 --> 16:25.550
You're so young.

16:25.552 --> 16:29.387
Oh, well, my momma
passed when I was 10.

16:29.389 --> 16:30.655
I had to bring up
my brothers and sisters.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.725
But even before that,
I had baby cousins
in joplin...

16:33.727 --> 16:38.162
She doesn't want
your family history.
She was being polite.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.131
She aksed.

16:41.066 --> 16:45.470
Either I'm losing
my mind or his hair...

16:45.472 --> 16:48.473
Is there something
crawling in it?

16:50.409 --> 16:53.444
Virginia: All my sales
reports are there.

16:57.149 --> 17:00.918
I sold over $40 worth
of products this week.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.321
Which is almost double
what I did the week before.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.456
Hmm, be still my heart.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.827
I did all of that without
using your sales script,
by the way.

17:09.829 --> 17:11.796
No wonder
your numbers stink.

17:11.798 --> 17:12.697
I don't...

17:12.699 --> 17:14.399
I am don't feel
comfortable reading
from a script

17:14.401 --> 17:18.269
That deliberately
makes women feel bad
about themselves.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.772
Yet women who feel
great about themselves

17:20.774 --> 17:22.507
Don't buy diet products.

17:22.509 --> 17:26.044
Which leaves us
with a conundrum.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.780
Listen, if you really
want to get good at this...

17:28.782 --> 17:31.883
I don't. I don't want
to get good at this.

17:31.885 --> 17:35.319
Selling diet pills may be
enough for most housewives

17:35.321 --> 17:38.623
That walk through your door,
I already have a career.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.358
Oh, you're
following your dreams.

17:40.360 --> 17:44.762
Yes. At the moment,
I need something to
supplement my income.

17:44.764 --> 17:48.599
Have you ever heard
of william elvis sloan?

17:49.401 --> 17:50.501
He invented cal-o-metric?

17:50.503 --> 17:54.505
He came up
with how to make
a toilet flush.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.339
Was that his calling?

17:55.341 --> 17:58.876
Did he wake up every
morning, tickled pink
and skipping off to work?

17:58.878 --> 18:04.649
Probably not.
But he died
a very rich man.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.752
So, sure.
"follow your dreams."

18:07.754 --> 18:09.654
It's a lovely
slogan for a life

18:09.656 --> 18:12.223
Most people can't
afford to live.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.858
But who knows?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.360
Maybe you're special.

18:32.177 --> 18:35.213
I asked for the cheque.
I assumed you weren't coming.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.981
I had to turn in
my sales report.

18:36.983 --> 18:42.487
Of course. Wouldn't want
our work to interfere
with your diet pills.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.590
Austin saw us last night
leaving our room together.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.459
Apparently, his wife is
staying with her mother,
in alton

18:48.461 --> 18:52.163
So when he takes the kids
he stays at this hotel.

18:52.165 --> 18:52.730
Jesus.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.299
It's not a problem.
I handled it.

18:55.301 --> 18:55.867
Says who?

18:55.869 --> 18:58.836
If someone like austin
can walk through here,
that means anyone can.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.906
Luckily, there's nothing
strange about two colleagues

19:01.908 --> 19:03.808
Having a drink
in a hotel lobby.

19:03.810 --> 19:06.043
Virginia,
I am a married man.

19:06.045 --> 19:10.114
You do understand
what it would mean
if this would get out?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.618
I do.

19:13.620 --> 19:16.154
Which means
it'd probably
be imprudent

19:16.156 --> 19:18.589
For us to
head upstairs.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.057
Wouldn't it?

19:22.628 --> 19:25.029
(baby crying)

19:27.633 --> 19:29.033
It's a mess, I know.

19:29.035 --> 19:32.069
I wasn't expecting
you home until late.

19:32.137 --> 19:36.741
I hope you ate something.
I haven't made
a thing for dinner.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.579
Everything's fine.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.981
We found lice
in johnny's hair.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.016
But I got a book
from the library.

19:45.018 --> 19:48.419
And we just
need to wash everything,
all the fabric in the house.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.121
It shouldn't be a problem.

19:50.123 --> 19:50.922
Baby's crying.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.223
I know the
baby's crying.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.491
The baby's been
crying all day.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.494
I can't get
the baby to
stop crying.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.097
I'm sorry.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.966
You have enough
to worry about,

20:01.968 --> 20:04.569
Now the girl
brings in lice.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.204
Coral?
Who else?

20:06.206 --> 20:06.871
I've never had lice.

20:06.873 --> 20:10.074
You've never had lice.
No one we know has had lice.

20:10.076 --> 20:13.311
You don't need to wash
everything, libby.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.112
Just the baby's clothes
and his blankets.

20:15.114 --> 20:20.117
Tomorrow, scrub his hair
with medicated shampoo they
sell at the super market.

20:20.119 --> 20:24.555
These are just a few
harmless insects.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.592
They'll be gone
in a day or two.

20:28.293 --> 20:28.926
See?

20:28.928 --> 20:33.798
It's so much nicer
when we can sort these
things out together.

20:37.502 --> 20:41.806
I'll take out
the diaper pail.

20:47.679 --> 20:49.146
The initial aim
of the program

20:49.148 --> 20:51.115
Is to expand access
to early screening

20:51.117 --> 20:56.254
Through a systematic outreach
effort to physicians and to...

20:56.455 --> 20:58.289
To...
Hospitals.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.291
And eventually,
we hope to establish

21:00.293 --> 21:02.560
A research facility at
washington university

21:02.562 --> 21:04.929
To develop new
methods of detection,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.397
Treatment
of cervical cancer.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.331
But that's still years
in the future.

21:07.333 --> 21:12.637
I am creating a research
center of my own at
the university of miami.

21:12.639 --> 21:16.374
Are you really?
How very interesting.

21:19.411 --> 21:23.781
This is the prototype
for the testing kit
we'll be sending out.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.517
We've included
a skort frim slip.

21:27.252 --> 21:29.620
Pardon?
A skort frim slip.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.456
There's a short
film strip.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.993
Yes. It is short.

21:36.395 --> 21:38.829
Do you have any questions?

21:46.271 --> 21:46.837
Hey, doc.

21:46.839 --> 21:50.041
Do you time it
so we arrive at the
same time every morning,

21:50.043 --> 21:52.443
Or is it just the heavens
conspiring against me?

21:52.445 --> 21:56.847
Actually, we wait
till we see
your car pull in.

21:56.849 --> 21:57.348
'morning.

21:57.350 --> 22:00.518
(chuckles)
gene came to
give a donation.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.586
Well, you've
been more than
generous already.

22:02.588 --> 22:03.587
Not that kind
of donation.

22:03.589 --> 22:09.193
Um, poor gene's getting
antsy with all this
testing we're doing.

22:09.195 --> 22:12.296
He's been asking when
we're gonna move on.

22:12.298 --> 22:12.963
Move on to...

22:12.965 --> 22:14.131
Betts says you're
good on her end.

22:14.133 --> 22:18.569
You just need
a sample of my swimmers,
pardon my french.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.271
(both chuckling)

22:20.472 --> 22:23.140
Ready, moretti?
Yeah.

22:26.745 --> 22:27.812
Good morning,
dr. Masters.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.914
Betty, I think it
best if you wait...

22:29.916 --> 22:32.216
Don't worry, I can
take care of this.

22:32.218 --> 22:33.417
If I could have a...

22:33.419 --> 22:34.819
You know
your way around.

22:34.821 --> 22:35.953
Betty: I'm very observant.

22:35.955 --> 22:36.921
I really must insist...

22:36.923 --> 22:38.122
All right, reading
material. Here.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.358
You have a thing
for ava gardner.

22:40.360 --> 22:41.492
Dr. Masters, could I...

22:41.494 --> 22:43.561
Don't have
too much fun.

22:43.563 --> 22:44.428
Could I just...

22:44.430 --> 22:45.229
Barbara, what is it?

22:45.231 --> 22:49.133
Dr. Greathouse wants
to know what time tonight's
study is starting.

22:49.135 --> 22:51.402
He would like to be there.

22:52.137 --> 22:52.570
7:00.

22:52.572 --> 22:57.007
Make sure he
knows this evening's
area of focus, please.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.376
(stammering) yes.

22:58.378 --> 23:03.047
We'll be looking at men
with enlarged prostates.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.949
Primarily elderly men.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.551
Engaged in
auto manipulation.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.586
Auto... I'm sorry.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.588
Old men masturbating.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.725
You're gonna say...
In my office.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.360
Mmm-hmm.

23:20.365 --> 23:21.432
I'm almost done here.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.400
Maybe I can take
the baby now?

23:22.402 --> 23:26.003
Actually, there's
something I'd like to
speak to you about.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.073
I need you to
use this tonight.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.207
What is it?

23:30.209 --> 23:32.176
It's a special shampoo.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.012
It gets rid of
anything that's...

23:35.014 --> 23:37.081
The eggs or, um...

23:38.784 --> 23:41.786
Everyone you live with,
your family, should use it.

23:41.788 --> 23:46.657
I don't have lice,
mrs. Masters.
They didn't come from me.

23:47.492 --> 23:49.894
I never said
that they did.

24:03.008 --> 24:05.109
All you have to do
is look in there

24:05.111 --> 24:05.976
And tell him
he's got bum sperm.

24:05.978 --> 24:09.780
This I would
divine by somehow
staring into a cup?

24:09.782 --> 24:10.748
Put it under
a magnifying glass.

24:10.750 --> 24:14.785
Shame you didn't
pursue medicine,
you have the head for it.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.120
He won't know
the difference.

24:16.122 --> 24:16.954
I know.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.689
I will not tell
a patient
he's sterile

24:18.691 --> 24:22.059
When I know that
the only reason
he can't have children

24:22.061 --> 24:24.161
Is because
his wife underwent
a tubal ligation...

24:24.163 --> 24:27.531
You want to get
all high and mighty?
Fine.

24:27.533 --> 24:28.232
Let's end it now.

24:28.234 --> 24:31.402
You tell him
I'm infertile.
Tell him the truth.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.571
You tell him.
(knocking on door)

24:34.439 --> 24:35.940
Hey.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.342
Sorry to interrupt. I...

24:38.344 --> 24:41.011
I crossed
the finish line.

24:41.746 --> 24:43.214
(clears throat)

24:44.583 --> 24:46.851
Betty: It's all just...

24:48.587 --> 24:51.288
Well, it's cruel.
Oh.

24:51.290 --> 24:56.393
You're out there
in the john making
baby batter,

24:56.395 --> 24:58.496
While in here,
the doc gets
the results

24:58.498 --> 25:03.367
From my very last test
and it turns out
I'm the culprit.

25:05.136 --> 25:06.670
(sighs)

25:07.906 --> 25:10.708
I don't even
know what to say.

25:10.976 --> 25:12.943
Nobody does.

25:12.945 --> 25:14.879
Only betty knows.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.915
You know,
your whole life
you think,

25:17.917 --> 25:20.684
"all you gotta do
is find the right fella.

25:20.686 --> 25:24.021
"getting knocked up,
that's the easy part."

25:24.023 --> 25:28.292
But to find out your body's
just not cut out for it...

25:28.294 --> 25:29.760
Doc.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.397
Is there anything
we can do?

25:33.765 --> 25:35.733
I'm afraid not.

25:36.134 --> 25:38.435
Nothing at all?

25:40.505 --> 25:42.973
Well, it's a real blow.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.975
Uh...

25:45.076 --> 25:47.278
Thank you for trying.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.247
I didn't do
anything. Really.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.452
I think it's
only right that, uh,

25:56.121 --> 25:59.557
You dispose
of this, betty.

26:03.328 --> 26:07.731
Hey, you okay?
'cause I'm not
sure I am.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.167
Um, I'm, you know...

26:10.702 --> 26:11.502
Devastated.

26:11.504 --> 26:15.673
Hey, but at least
we still got each other.

26:15.675 --> 26:19.043
Uh, hell, the cashier.
We need to settle the bill.

26:19.045 --> 26:22.580
No. Dr. Masters isn't gonna
charge us for this morning.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.816
We gotta pay for
the fertility tests,
treatments.

26:25.818 --> 26:26.483
No, gene, honey.

26:26.485 --> 26:30.054
Let's just go home
and start the
healing process.

26:30.056 --> 26:35.025
Betts, we're here.
Let's just get
it over with now.

26:37.963 --> 26:39.930
(elevator dinging)

26:41.833 --> 26:45.269
Your taxi should
be here any minute.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.806
Dr. Papanicolaou,
if I may speak frankly.

26:48.808 --> 26:53.644
You chair the committee
for the williams prize,
correct?

26:53.646 --> 26:54.211
I do.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.615
Well, dr. Depaul
would never say this.

26:57.617 --> 26:58.849
But that kind
of endorsement,

26:58.851 --> 27:00.351
It would be
invaluable to
our program.

27:00.353 --> 27:05.022
Not to mention what it
would mean to dr. Depaul
on a personal level.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.290
Coming from you.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.292
Nobody stood
behind this program.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.127
The administration
was strong-armed

27:10.129 --> 27:12.596
Into offering even
a modicum of support.

27:12.598 --> 27:15.432
Everything dr. Depaul's
accomplished here,

27:15.434 --> 27:16.667
She's done on her own.

27:16.669 --> 27:17.968
With no help,
no guidance.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.437
I did not expect
to be impressed
this morning.

27:20.439 --> 27:26.043
To be honest,
I did not even
remember dr. Depaul.

27:26.045 --> 27:29.313
But I am always pleased,
years later,

27:29.315 --> 27:34.151
To hear that a student
considered me their mentor.

27:34.252 --> 27:36.253
I didn't say "mentor."

27:36.255 --> 27:38.389
And neither did
dr. Depaul.

27:38.391 --> 27:40.024
She says she
never had a mentor.

27:40.026 --> 27:43.527
Mentors were reserved
for male students.

27:44.095 --> 27:46.296
You may not have
remembered her.

27:46.298 --> 27:50.067
But I guarantee you,
you will remember her now.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.769
Because what
she has done here,

27:51.771 --> 27:54.738
This program,
all on her own.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.607
It is remarkable.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.410
Yes. You are
right about that.

27:59.412 --> 28:03.614
Well, then I hope you
will take that
into consideration

28:03.616 --> 28:07.518
As you make your selections
for the williams prize.

28:16.828 --> 28:22.433
Now, you control
the device yourself.

28:22.435 --> 28:23.767
(whirring)

28:23.769 --> 28:27.371
Speed, intensity, depth...

28:27.373 --> 28:28.939
It's freezing.

28:29.607 --> 28:34.411
My partner
usually warms it
with a hot towel.

28:34.413 --> 28:37.481
I'd completely
forgotten.

28:43.455 --> 28:44.621
Well,

28:44.623 --> 28:49.159
The friction between
the device and the vaginal
walls should

28:49.161 --> 28:51.995
Gradually increase
the temperature.

28:59.604 --> 29:01.705
(woman gasping softly)

29:18.356 --> 29:20.491
I thought we were
doing prostates.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.893
Last-minute
scheduling change.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.696
I see you opted for
old and fat instead.

29:25.698 --> 29:27.965
Post-menopausal, actually.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.366
Oh.

29:29.467 --> 29:31.401
Pretend I'm not here.

29:31.403 --> 29:34.938
I'll be invisible.
A fly on the wall.

29:36.841 --> 29:38.776
(woman moaning)

29:41.980 --> 29:43.747
Thar she blows.

29:43.749 --> 29:47.217
(chuckles) sorry.
No comments from
the peanut gallery, I know.

29:47.219 --> 29:50.687
Have you asked the board
about my assistant?

29:50.689 --> 29:51.355
Yes, I did.

29:51.357 --> 29:54.358
Actually,
I spoke to them at length
about mrs. Johnson

29:54.360 --> 29:55.359
Just this morning.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.629
They haven't made
a decision yet, obviously,

29:58.631 --> 29:59.963
But they seemed
open to it.

29:59.965 --> 30:03.433
I'm happy to speak to them,
answer any questions...

30:03.435 --> 30:04.935
Steady on, pal.

30:04.937 --> 30:07.971
It's a process.
It takes time.

30:07.973 --> 30:12.709
But trust me,
we'll get there.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.013
(gasps)

30:20.418 --> 30:21.685
Knock, knock.
(knocks)

30:21.687 --> 30:26.089
Noticed you're burning
the midnight oil.
Thought I'd say hello.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.457
Hello.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.727
You know
what the worst part
of this divorce is?

30:30.729 --> 30:32.095
It's not fighting
with lawyers

30:32.097 --> 30:33.197
Or driving half-an-hour
to see your kids.

30:33.199 --> 30:37.167
Or watching your wife
of 12 years turn
into some kinda she-wolf.

30:37.169 --> 30:40.404
It's eating potato
chips for dinner.

30:43.575 --> 30:47.277
I keep fantasizing
about elise's cooking.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.313
Beef stroganoff.

30:49.315 --> 30:50.013
Tuna noodle casserole.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.082
Jiffy corn casserole,
cheeseburger
casserole.

30:52.084 --> 30:56.420
Are you just
going to sit there?
Talking?

30:58.056 --> 31:00.424
Because if so,

31:00.426 --> 31:02.492
I need a drink.

31:03.361 --> 31:03.861
(laughing)

31:03.863 --> 31:06.597
I didn't even know that
water polo was a sport,

31:06.599 --> 31:09.299
Let alone that
it was my favorite sport.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.869
(both laughing)

31:16.674 --> 31:19.009
Um, I have a stack
of exams to grade.

31:19.011 --> 31:23.280
Give virginia
the answer sheet.
Let her do it.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.582
One more.

31:29.687 --> 31:30.921
To virginia.

31:30.923 --> 31:32.456
Virginia.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.426
(sighs)

31:38.429 --> 31:39.596
It's funny.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.766
The second I met virginia,
I thought I had her pegged.

31:42.768 --> 31:45.535
Just another woman
unwilling to do the hard work,

31:45.537 --> 31:47.371
Ready to latch on
to the first man

31:47.373 --> 31:50.374
That can take her to
the next rung on the ladder.

31:50.376 --> 31:53.777
Well, then, that proves
you're a good
judge of character.

31:53.779 --> 31:56.880
She's closer to
you than anyone.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.151
How long
have you known?

32:02.687 --> 32:05.088
So long.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.390
Very long.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.858
I saw them
last night
leaving a hotel.

32:07.860 --> 32:12.062
Virginia, god bless her,
tried to give me some
baloney story about,

32:12.064 --> 32:15.532
They're publishing the study,
working out of the hotel.

32:15.534 --> 32:19.469
She used to do this thing
every once in a while,
in the lab.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.238
She'd lean in
and fix bill's bow tie,

32:21.240 --> 32:24.541
Just sort of
straighten it out,
you know?

32:24.543 --> 32:28.445
There is a fence
around bill masters.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.213
Chain link
with barbed wire.

32:30.215 --> 32:31.882
Nobody gets past that.
Nobody gets close.

32:31.884 --> 32:36.720
But virginia,
would just
waltz right through.

32:36.722 --> 32:40.590
I think back now,
how could I miss
something so obvious?

32:40.592 --> 32:42.025
How could I not
have known they were

32:42.027 --> 32:44.361
Sleeping together
the entire time?

32:52.603 --> 32:55.672
Tatti greathouse gave me
a recipe for osso buco.

32:55.674 --> 32:58.709
She says it's better than
the one at bella rosa.

32:58.711 --> 33:01.878
I may not be home
until after 9:00.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.246
Oh, we could
have a late supper.

33:03.248 --> 33:05.549
Close our eyes,
pretend we're in florence.

33:05.551 --> 33:07.184
I'll take that.

33:07.251 --> 33:10.787
Good morning,
mrs. Masters.
Dr. Masters.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.055
Good morning.

33:12.057 --> 33:13.824
Hello, coral.

33:14.826 --> 33:15.859
I see, um...

33:15.861 --> 33:19.062
Well, I see your hair
is the same as
it was yesterday.

33:19.064 --> 33:23.433
Oh, yes, mrs. Masters.
I feel like it suits me.

33:23.435 --> 33:27.004
I'm referring to
the shampoo
that I gave you.

33:27.006 --> 33:27.671
Did you use it?

33:27.673 --> 33:29.906
My brother checked.
He didn't find nothing.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.676
"anything."
he didn't find anything.

33:34.312 --> 33:38.248
It costs me $4 to
get my hair done
every week.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.916
I can't afford
to mess it up.

33:39.918 --> 33:41.051
So you didn't
use the shampoo.

33:41.053 --> 33:45.722
Even though you told me,
you promised me,
that you would.

33:45.724 --> 33:48.725
Dr. Masters,
I don't have lice.
I swear I don't.

33:48.727 --> 33:51.028
My brother said
negroes can't even get it.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.096
Coral,
this is between
you and me.

33:53.098 --> 33:53.864
Her brother is right.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.700
Negroes do have
tightly coiled,
low-density hair,

33:56.702 --> 33:57.734
Which makes it very
inhospitable for lice.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.737
I read about it in
the  <i>wellford</i>
<i>journal of medicine.</i>

34:00.739 --> 34:03.473
So it is unlikely
she would have them.

34:03.475 --> 34:05.275
Unlikely is
not impossible.

34:05.277 --> 34:09.713
I don't see why we need to
involve dr. Masters
in this discussion at all.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.548
(baby crying)

34:14.452 --> 34:16.520
I'll go get him.

34:31.302 --> 34:34.004
Is everything all right?

34:38.209 --> 34:40.477
I cheated in college.

34:42.180 --> 34:42.813
Calculus.

34:42.815 --> 34:44.848
I could never
get my head
around calculus.

34:44.850 --> 34:49.553
No matter how
many hours I studied,
I couldn't crack a b plus.

34:49.555 --> 34:50.854
And I was
a straight-a student.

34:50.856 --> 34:54.624
I figured medical schools
couldn't turn away
a straight-a student,

34:54.626 --> 34:57.027
Even if she
were a woman.

34:57.029 --> 34:58.862
So I bought
the final exam from
previous year

34:58.864 --> 35:05.469
From a rather
unscrupulous graduate
student named marvin for $10.

35:08.106 --> 35:10.173
I am impressed.

35:10.341 --> 35:13.944
Lillian depaul
breaks the rules.

35:15.580 --> 35:19.316
It was a shortcut.
That's all.

35:19.417 --> 35:21.084
Does it negate
the work
I've done since?

35:21.086 --> 35:25.889
Does one shortcut diminish
everything that comes after?

35:28.526 --> 35:31.161
So...
So...

35:31.562 --> 35:34.865
That's my secret.
What's yours?

35:34.867 --> 35:37.367
My secret?
(chuckling)

35:37.369 --> 35:40.070
I don't have
any secrets.

35:40.072 --> 35:42.572
I don't believe you.

35:47.712 --> 35:49.179
(scoffs)

35:54.352 --> 35:55.719
Virginia,

35:55.721 --> 35:58.522
You've seen me
at my worst.

35:59.056 --> 36:01.925
Lying naked on
a hospital sheet,

36:01.927 --> 36:04.928
Limping to
the car after
radiation.

36:04.930 --> 36:09.032
I've shared nearly
everything with you.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.400
Too much, even.

36:10.402 --> 36:15.605
It seems only right that
you should share with me.

36:26.050 --> 36:28.251
Honestly, lillian,

36:30.755 --> 36:33.823
I'm not that interesting.

36:47.905 --> 36:51.308
Coral, could you
come here, please?

36:53.077 --> 36:54.511
This relationship
is about trust.

36:54.513 --> 36:58.381
I leave you in my house
every day with my child
and if I can't...

36:58.383 --> 36:58.915
Mrs. Masters...

36:58.917 --> 37:01.384
What if something,
god forbid,
happened to johnny?

37:01.386 --> 37:03.153
How do I know
you'd tell me the truth?

37:03.155 --> 37:06.423
How can I trust
anything you say
to me anymore?

37:06.425 --> 37:07.657
I'm sorry.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.659
I need you to
sit down now, please.

37:09.661 --> 37:12.362
Mrs. Masters,
I'll use the shampoo.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.463
No, coral,
that's the point.

37:13.465 --> 37:16.833
I can't trust you
anymore to
do it yourself.

37:18.002 --> 37:20.770
If you don't sit down, coral,
you'll have to leave.

37:20.772 --> 37:23.773
And you won't be
welcome back.

37:32.883 --> 37:35.819
Put your
head back, please.

37:37.722 --> 37:40.657
Is the water warm enough?

37:42.994 --> 37:44.894
We need to be
on the same side.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.698
If you have a problem
with something,
you come to me.

37:48.700 --> 37:54.170
Dr. Masters is a busy man,
and we don't
need to involve him.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.507
He's not a part of this.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.975
You and I,

37:58.977 --> 38:02.312
We need to
stick together, okay?

38:02.314 --> 38:05.682
I hope you can
understand that.

38:21.365 --> 38:26.136
Please.
To get your hair re-done.
It's my treat.

38:36.981 --> 38:40.617
I appreciate you meeting me on
such short notice,
dr. Papanicolaou.

38:40.619 --> 38:44.120
I don't have much time.
My plane leaves in one hour.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.056
This won't take long.

38:46.590 --> 38:48.491
I called because
I would like to ask

38:48.493 --> 38:50.627
You to take my
program with you.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.595
To miami,
to your new
research center.

38:52.597 --> 38:56.700
I'm sorry if there's been
a misunderstanding, lillian.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.735
But my staff is
already in place...

38:58.737 --> 39:01.738
No, I'm not asking
you for a job.

39:03.274 --> 39:06.076
After some consideration,

39:06.410 --> 39:10.714
I've come to the conclusion
that this university simply

39:10.716 --> 39:12.415
Doesn't have
the proper personnel

39:12.417 --> 39:15.218
To fully realize
the program.

39:15.653 --> 39:18.722
You understand,
if I were to oversee this,

39:18.724 --> 39:23.293
I would keep you informed
of any major decisions,
of course,

39:23.295 --> 39:26.129
But in terms of
the day-to-day
management...

39:26.131 --> 39:27.263
Once I give you
the program,

39:27.265 --> 39:30.533
My role in it
will be finished.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.907
I understand.

39:46.617 --> 39:50.186
Ah, bill. So?

39:50.188 --> 39:51.020
So what?

39:51.022 --> 39:54.290
So what's on
the menu tonight?

39:54.859 --> 39:57.160
Actually, I was looking
for you, doug.

39:57.162 --> 40:02.932
Since I haven't had a chance
to apologize yet
for last night.

40:02.934 --> 40:07.504
I realized
afterward I'd completely
forgotten to warn you.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.239
About the
transference effect.

40:09.241 --> 40:12.675
Does transference
involve attractive women?

40:12.677 --> 40:17.013
Yes, it can.
But not necessarily.

40:17.015 --> 40:20.283
Observation
of sexual activity

40:20.285 --> 40:25.188
Can produce
a kind of tension
in the observers.

40:25.190 --> 40:29.859
The researchers
can find themselves
experiencing certain

40:29.861 --> 40:32.095
Uninvited
erotic sensations.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.531
Now, this can happen between
a man and a woman.

40:34.533 --> 40:39.068
It can also happen between
a man and another man.

40:40.938 --> 40:42.906
I'm not quite sure
I understand.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.541
I've been doing this
a long time,

40:44.543 --> 40:47.210
So I'm immune to the
transference effect myself.

40:47.212 --> 40:52.849
But I have seen other men
in that small, confined space.

40:52.851 --> 40:56.052
Well...
The danger is high.

40:56.054 --> 41:01.324
And for those male observers
that do get drawn in, well,

41:01.559 --> 41:05.562
They often don't
come out the other side.

41:05.564 --> 41:11.100
At least,
not the same way
they went in.

41:11.802 --> 41:14.604
You mean
like in wrestling?

41:15.406 --> 41:17.774
Something like that.

41:18.576 --> 41:20.176
(sighs)

41:28.986 --> 41:30.186
You're nervous.

41:30.188 --> 41:31.187
How can you tell?

41:31.189 --> 41:34.257
Slight vasocongestion
in your face and chest.

41:34.259 --> 41:37.594
Mild fasciculation
in the hands, feet.

41:38.529 --> 41:42.131
You're flushed.
And trembling.

41:42.133 --> 41:43.900
(laughing)

41:45.903 --> 41:47.537
Is that bad?

41:56.247 --> 41:59.949
Honest to god,
bill, this is better
than my bachelor party.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.085
(all laughing)

42:05.689 --> 42:07.357
Step outside, doug.

42:07.359 --> 42:08.725
Sure.

42:15.032 --> 42:15.732
Yes?

42:15.734 --> 42:21.404
This is a scientific study,
not a stag film
in a frat house.

42:21.406 --> 42:24.307
Your colleagues
are very interested
in your work.

42:24.309 --> 42:26.242
I think you
should appreciate that.

42:26.244 --> 42:27.510
Get them out of here.

42:27.512 --> 42:30.713
I know bart scully
treated you like
the second coming.

42:30.715 --> 42:33.650
But here, in this hospital,
you are my employee.

42:33.652 --> 42:35.018
You have grossly
misjudged me

42:35.020 --> 42:37.186
If you think I would
allow those baboons

42:37.188 --> 42:41.457
To sit in my exam room,
slurping chop suey,
mocking my work.

42:41.459 --> 42:42.525
The terms
of my employment.

42:42.527 --> 42:45.161
The terms between
you and me
are changing now.

42:45.163 --> 42:47.697
You will clear
my exam room,

42:47.699 --> 42:50.033
And you will never
get near it again.

42:50.035 --> 42:52.835
You will authorize
mrs. Johnson's hiring

42:52.837 --> 42:55.939
Starting
tomorrow morning.

42:55.941 --> 42:59.042
Let me tell you
how it works
with secretaries.

42:59.044 --> 43:02.745
You don't promote them to
lofty positions above
their pay grade,

43:02.747 --> 43:05.248
Or give them titles like
"research assistant."

43:05.250 --> 43:08.217
I didn't even mention
your assistant to the board,

43:08.219 --> 43:10.086
And you should
thank me for that.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.721
I'm keeping you
from being perceived

43:11.723 --> 43:14.424
As a man that only
thinks with his cock,

43:14.426 --> 43:16.726
And not
with his head.

43:17.661 --> 43:19.629
As far as
your study goes,

43:19.631 --> 43:22.732
Your colleagues
are on your side.

43:23.334 --> 43:25.668
So relax.

43:39.783 --> 43:43.720
Care for one, bill?
They are delicious.
Not that spicy.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.959
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:51.328 --> 43:53.029
(grunts)

43:58.502 --> 44:00.136
Take it easy.

44:00.337 --> 44:02.305
By the time
I'm off the phone
tomorrow morning,

44:02.307 --> 44:04.540
There's not going
to be a single hospital
in the midwest

44:04.542 --> 44:07.944
That's going to let you
so much as step through
their doors.

44:08.712 --> 44:12.148
(woman moaning)

44:14.852 --> 44:16.586
(vibrating)

44:20.357 --> 44:22.291
(typewriter clacking)

44:22.593 --> 44:23.559
These need to be
mimeographed

44:23.561 --> 44:26.329
And sent to
dr. Papanicolaou's office
at cornell

44:26.331 --> 44:27.330
As soon as possible.

44:27.332 --> 44:30.299
He requested the files
for our program?

44:31.035 --> 44:32.602
Maybe he wants
to share them with

44:32.604 --> 44:33.603
The committee for
the williams prize.

44:33.605 --> 44:37.273
Actually,
dr. Papanicolaou will be
bringing the program

44:37.275 --> 44:39.442
To his new miami
research center.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.143
What do you mean?

44:40.145 --> 44:42.845
You'll need to
speak to someone
in the audio-visual department

44:42.847 --> 44:45.114
To make duplicates
of the film strip.

44:45.116 --> 44:47.583
You gave him
the program?

44:52.656 --> 44:54.891
Why didn't you
tell me about this?

44:54.893 --> 44:56.592
I'm telling
you right now.

44:56.594 --> 44:58.494
After you
made your decision?

44:58.496 --> 45:01.964
I don't need to consult you
about the course
of my research.

45:01.966 --> 45:05.501
Your research?
We are partners.

45:05.503 --> 45:09.238
I worked like a dog to
get this program
off the ground.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.274
I recommended you
for the williams prize.

45:11.276 --> 45:12.642
I didn't ask you
to do that.

45:12.644 --> 45:15.445
I did it anyway.
For you.

45:15.979 --> 45:18.648
Papanicolaou will put
his name on your work.

45:18.650 --> 45:20.683
You won't even be
a footnote.

45:20.685 --> 45:25.354
I didn't go into medicine to
see my name on a study,
virginia.

45:42.573 --> 45:43.172
Loraine?

45:43.174 --> 45:46.309
Virginia johnson.
We met last summer
at the block party.

45:46.311 --> 45:47.110
Of course.

45:47.112 --> 45:48.511
Are you still at maternity?
I am.

45:48.513 --> 45:51.681
Although, I've recently
transitioned to
a new line of work.

45:51.683 --> 45:56.385
I'm the new neighborhood
ambassador for cal-o-metric.

45:56.820 --> 45:58.988
This isn't one of
those fad diets, is it?

45:58.990 --> 46:00.523
My sister tried
the cabbage soup one.

46:00.525 --> 46:03.292
She ended up so bloated
we called her
the hindenburg.

46:03.294 --> 46:06.996
I can assure you,
cal-o-metric is
not a fad at all.

46:06.998 --> 46:08.264
Our trademarked
nutritional formula

46:08.266 --> 46:11.901
Is based on
the most
cutting-edge science.

46:11.903 --> 46:13.870
Good luck with it.

46:14.004 --> 46:16.339
Let me ask you
something, loraine.

46:16.341 --> 46:20.443
When you see
yourself in the mirror,
how do you feel?

46:20.445 --> 46:21.811
How do you feel?

46:21.813 --> 46:23.780
I feel great.

46:24.248 --> 46:28.417
Well, you're lucky then.
I don't know
many women that do.

46:28.419 --> 46:29.519
I'll tell you who does.

46:29.521 --> 46:33.289
A woman who's confident
in her figure,
she feels great.

46:33.291 --> 46:36.893
In fact, a woman
like that feels fantastic.

46:36.895 --> 46:39.495
But a woman
who's not so sure,

46:39.497 --> 46:41.964
Who's maybe put on
a pound or two over
the years,

46:41.966 --> 46:45.034
Who notices
the slightest sag
here and there,

46:45.036 --> 46:46.702
Wonders why her
husband doesn't

46:46.704 --> 46:48.771
Look at her quite
the way he used to,

46:48.773 --> 46:51.107
Or even
the checkout boy,

46:51.109 --> 46:52.575
Who used to stare openly,

46:52.577 --> 46:56.379
But now just looks past her
like she's not even there.

46:56.613 --> 47:02.251
A woman like that,
she doesn't feel
fantastic at all.

47:05.155 --> 47:08.958
This could be
the start of
a brand new you.

47:09.493 --> 47:11.861
I know it was for me.

47:35.219 --> 47:36.686
Bill.

47:36.954 --> 47:38.321
I need to talk to you.

47:38.323 --> 47:39.922
I hate to
tell you this,

47:39.924 --> 47:43.459
But your kid's got
a bad case
of the cutes.

47:43.461 --> 47:46.362
Dr. Langham
decided to drop by.

47:46.364 --> 47:46.929
Isn't that nice?

47:46.931 --> 47:49.065
I'm in major need
of advice, bill.

47:49.067 --> 47:49.832
I've got this new patient.

47:49.834 --> 47:52.235
Real head-scratcher.
Right up your alley.

47:52.237 --> 47:54.737
The skeletal system is
not exactly my area...

47:54.739 --> 47:56.172
Libby also
invited me to dinner.

47:56.174 --> 48:00.109
She said the
two magic words.
Veal and shanks.

48:00.111 --> 48:00.743
How could I resist?

48:00.745 --> 48:04.480
Plus, I picked up
a few montecristos
this weekend.

48:04.482 --> 48:06.282
Care to join me outside?

48:06.284 --> 48:08.317
I don't smoke.

48:08.319 --> 48:10.353
Why don't you join me, bill?

48:11.388 --> 48:15.091
You wanna
go see mommy?
I know.

48:20.063 --> 48:23.666
Betty: I did try to make
the heavenly
ham loaf first.

48:23.668 --> 48:26.102
It was
a betty crocker recipe
and everything.

48:26.104 --> 48:31.674
Oh, who, by the way,
is a phony.
Did you know that?

48:32.109 --> 48:34.644
Betty crocker is
some advertising idea,

48:34.646 --> 48:38.147
Dreamed up by some suit
sitting in a fancy boardroom,

48:38.149 --> 48:40.917
Not a real person at all.

48:40.919 --> 48:43.119
It was a woman.

48:43.754 --> 48:46.689
A woman came up
with betty crocker.

48:47.524 --> 48:51.794
Well, you would know,
being in the food business.

48:51.796 --> 48:57.033
And I guess you would be
the expert on phony bettys.

48:58.201 --> 48:59.802
Okay.

49:01.338 --> 49:03.639
I deserve that.

49:03.641 --> 49:07.276
But just so you know,
I'm not going anywhere.

49:07.278 --> 49:12.915
So when you're done extracting
your pound of flesh,
I'll be here.

49:13.383 --> 49:15.518
You knew you
couldn't have kids.

49:15.520 --> 49:16.319
You knew.

49:16.321 --> 49:18.754
Before we married.
Before we met.

49:18.889 --> 49:19.989
Why didn't you
just tell me?

49:19.991 --> 49:22.692
You never would
have married me
if you knew the truth.

49:22.694 --> 49:23.392
You know that?

49:23.394 --> 49:25.161
I know what you saw
when you first met me

49:25.163 --> 49:26.896
A good christian girl
at church,

49:26.898 --> 49:28.164
Who'd have
good christian babies.

49:28.166 --> 49:30.433
I didn't meet you at church.
Of course you did.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.234
Remember?
It was the palm
Sunday potluck.

49:32.236 --> 49:37.206
And I bumped into you,
your coleslaw
fell into my pocket book...

49:37.208 --> 49:39.175
It was before that.

49:43.347 --> 49:47.049
I've always been
shy with girls.

49:47.284 --> 49:50.553
Always had
trouble talking to them.

49:50.555 --> 49:53.289
So, I thought, you know,

49:55.325 --> 49:56.759
I'd go to a...

49:57.427 --> 50:00.062
Go to a brothel,

50:00.731 --> 50:04.767
Maybe there
I could learn.

50:05.102 --> 50:06.836
You know?

50:06.903 --> 50:13.075
I'd never met a girl
who was nice to me like that.

50:13.510 --> 50:14.643
And I didn't
want to leave.

50:14.645 --> 50:16.979
I was so scared
that I'd never
see you again.

50:16.981 --> 50:19.682
When I walked
into church
that morning,

50:19.684 --> 50:22.018
And you were
standing right there,

50:22.020 --> 50:26.122
I knew we were
meant to be.

50:27.791 --> 50:30.126
I never thought
you were a good
christian girl.

50:30.128 --> 50:33.796
I just thought
you were the
love of my life.

50:53.417 --> 50:56.052
I will admit.
It's an acquired taste.

50:56.054 --> 50:57.887
I've always liked
the way it looks.

50:57.889 --> 51:01.190
Gives me sort of
a hemingway air, I think.

51:02.025 --> 51:05.161
So what advice
can I give you?

51:05.163 --> 51:08.731
Actually,
there's some advice
I'd like to give you.

51:08.733 --> 51:11.600
Do you know why
I married elise?

51:13.737 --> 51:14.904
I thought
it would cure me.

51:14.906 --> 51:18.908
No more wandering eye
or chasing ass
like a teenager.

51:18.910 --> 51:19.642
It would be like magic.

51:19.644 --> 51:22.378
As soon as I put the ring
on my finger, abracadabra,

51:22.380 --> 51:24.346
All that stuff
would disappear,

51:24.348 --> 51:26.348
Well, it would
just be me and her.

51:26.350 --> 51:31.087
I screwed a dental
hygienist named gerty
three months later.

51:31.089 --> 51:32.788
Hated myself for it, too.

51:32.790 --> 51:35.091
Then,
I spent the
next 12 years

51:35.093 --> 51:36.826
Hating myself
over and over again.

51:36.828 --> 51:40.062
Most people get burned
and don't touch
the stove again.

51:40.064 --> 51:44.733
So what
the hell's wrong with me
that I can't stop touching it?

51:46.069 --> 51:49.105
You don't know
how many times
I've asked myself,

51:49.107 --> 51:52.541
"why can't you
just be more like bill?"

51:53.577 --> 51:56.879
And then the other night

51:58.915 --> 52:01.150
At the hotel,
I realized, I've been

52:01.152 --> 52:03.853
Punishing myself
for no reason.

52:03.855 --> 52:06.188
You and me,
we're the same.

52:06.190 --> 52:08.691
Two men trying our best.

52:08.693 --> 52:10.326
I'm no better or worse
than bill masters.

52:10.328 --> 52:13.028
I thought virginia explained,
we're starting up
the study again.

52:13.030 --> 52:15.598
Come on, bill.
Look who you're
talking to here.

52:15.600 --> 52:18.367
I don't know what
you mean by that.

52:19.069 --> 52:21.537
Just don't do
it the way I did.

52:21.539 --> 52:24.140
You've got to
keep this thing
under wraps.

52:24.142 --> 52:26.275
I'm not the only one
who knows about it.

52:26.277 --> 52:29.879
Lillian depaul
has been wise to it
from the beginning.

52:29.881 --> 52:30.679
And take it from me,

52:30.681 --> 52:35.151
This bachelor life
isn't all it's
cracked up to be.

52:36.653 --> 52:37.386
Don't get me wrong.

52:37.388 --> 52:38.787
There are
some days I feel like,

52:38.789 --> 52:42.191
Literally, I've died
and gone to heaven.

52:42.193 --> 52:43.392
Literally.

52:43.394 --> 52:45.494
But I can't walk by
the nursery anymore.

52:45.496 --> 52:50.065
Because when I do see
those little bundles,

52:51.768 --> 52:56.038
All I can think is
how much I want
to see my kids.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.606
(sighs)

52:57.974 --> 52:59.942
All I'm saying is,

52:59.944 --> 53:02.645
Whatever this is
you have with virginia,

53:02.647 --> 53:08.184
You've got to weigh it
against all of this.

53:12.122 --> 53:14.390
Is it worth it?

53:20.463 --> 53:22.498
(telephone ringing)

53:27.204 --> 53:29.038
(sighs)

53:44.788 --> 53:47.323
Tatti greathouse
just called.

53:47.325 --> 53:51.527
She told me
the most
outlandish story.

53:51.529 --> 53:54.930
She said that
you were fired,

53:54.932 --> 53:58.133
That you assaulted
her husband.

53:58.435 --> 53:59.501
I did lose
my temper, libby.

53:59.503 --> 54:01.770
But you would've, too.
The man is
an utter philistine.

54:01.772 --> 54:05.541
Why do I have to
hear everything
about my husband thirdhand?

54:05.543 --> 54:07.943
I was going to tell you,
but austin was here.

54:07.945 --> 54:11.013
This is the second job
in two months, bill.

54:11.015 --> 54:15.184
Soon there won't be a hospital
left for you to storm out of.

54:15.186 --> 54:18.587
Lib...
Why are you
doing this to me?

54:18.589 --> 54:20.155
Is this our life now?

54:20.157 --> 54:22.124
You going from
one job to another,

54:22.126 --> 54:24.960
Always finding some reason
why it's not good enough?

54:24.962 --> 54:28.464
It's not about
good enough.
It's about...

54:28.466 --> 54:29.298
Your study?

54:29.300 --> 54:32.201
They didn't
understand your study?

54:32.203 --> 54:35.371
They didn't understand it
at maternity either.

54:35.373 --> 54:36.939
That doesn't mean
things won't work out.

54:36.941 --> 54:38.507
They will.
Everything will be fine.

54:38.509 --> 54:42.711
When, bill?
When, exactly,
will everything be fine?

54:42.713 --> 54:46.048
How many more opportunities
do you have to squander

54:46.050 --> 54:48.417
Before you make this work?

54:48.718 --> 54:54.490
You have a wife
and a child who
depend on you.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.659
Doesn't that mean anything?

54:56.661 --> 55:00.696
Yes. Yes, of course.

55:00.698 --> 55:03.465
That's all I think about.

55:04.301 --> 55:06.802
How to do right by you,

55:09.005 --> 55:11.040
The baby.

55:13.743 --> 55:16.945
You just have to
trust me right now.

55:16.947 --> 55:17.613
Okay.

55:17.615 --> 55:21.016
I am going to
take care of you.
Whatever happens.

55:21.018 --> 55:23.018
I will always
take care of you.

55:23.020 --> 55:26.055
You just have
to believe that.

55:26.057 --> 55:30.459
Please, libby.
I just... (stammers)

55:31.061 --> 55:34.330
I need...
All right. All right.

55:35.598 --> 55:38.200
You'll find
the right job.

55:38.401 --> 55:40.569
We'll be okay.

55:41.204 --> 55:43.839
Everything will be okay.

55:55.819 --> 55:58.654
What's six plus
four equal?

55:58.755 --> 56:00.489
Ten.

56:01.491 --> 56:02.758
What's six plus 12?

56:02.760 --> 56:06.261
Your brother can't do
your homework for you.

56:06.263 --> 56:07.262
He does it better, though.

56:07.264 --> 56:09.932
And what happens
when he isn't there, hmm?

56:09.934 --> 56:11.433
When the teacher
calls you in class?

56:11.435 --> 56:13.502
What are you
going to do then?

56:13.903 --> 56:17.072
You can't count
on anybody else
to do your work for you.

56:17.074 --> 56:18.540
You can only
count on yourself.

56:18.542 --> 56:22.311
Everything that's worth doing,
you have to do on your own.

56:22.313 --> 56:24.780
Did you do
everything on your own?

56:25.982 --> 56:27.783
No, I didn't.

56:27.984 --> 56:29.551
But I do now.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.254
From now on.

56:54.911 --> 56:56.011
Man:  <i>We're so very pleased</i>

56:56.013 --> 57:00.416
That you've
decided to join us,
dr. Masters.

57:00.418 --> 57:03.118
The pleasure is all mine.

57:03.286 --> 57:04.286
And I feel comfortable

57:04.288 --> 57:06.588
In speaking
for my partner
when I say

57:06.590 --> 57:08.590
How pleased
we both are

57:08.592 --> 57:13.095
To be bringing our
work here, together.
