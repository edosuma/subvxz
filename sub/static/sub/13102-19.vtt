WEBVTT

00:11.333 --> 00:13.750
(man on PA system)
'Hazmat team to Cargo Bay 7.'

00:13.833 --> 00:16.583
'Hazmat team to Cargo Bay 7.'

00:16.667 --> 00:19.917
Ambassador G'Kar,
welcome back.

00:20.000 --> 00:23.167
Captain Lochley.
Well, this is an honor.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.750
Well, I thought after
everything you went through

00:24.833 --> 00:27.958
on Centauri Prime, you might
like to see a friendly face.

00:28.042 --> 00:31.458
- How's Londo?
- I don't know.

00:31.542 --> 00:33.125
Though I mourn for my own people

00:33.208 --> 00:35.667
in all my life, I don't think
I have felt more pity

00:35.750 --> 00:37.792
for anyone than I do for him.

00:37.875 --> 00:39.917
Well, maybe Emperor Mollari
will have more of a chance

00:40.000 --> 00:42.542
at happiness than
Ambassador Mollari ever did.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.792
I doubt it.

00:43.875 --> 00:45.167
At least now,
things will settle

00:45.250 --> 00:46.625
down here for a while.

00:46.708 --> 00:48.708
Hm, maybe.
Um, I should mention

00:48.792 --> 00:49.958
that there are
a few of your people

00:50.042 --> 00:51.792
waiting to see you
in customs.

00:51.875 --> 00:53.542
- Just a few?
- Mm-hmm.

00:53.625 --> 00:56.292
Good, my presence
on Centauri Prime

00:56.375 --> 00:58.208
during this little war
has probably cooled

00:58.292 --> 00:59.792
their enthusiasm a bit.

00:59.875 --> 01:02.542
I was afraid for a while
that this cult of personality

01:02.625 --> 01:04.542
was getting out of hand.

01:04.625 --> 01:07.958
What matters is that
you came to meet me.

01:08.042 --> 01:10.667
G'Kar, I wouldn't have
missed this for the world.

01:19.458 --> 01:22.958
[all chanting]
G'Kar! G'Kar! G'Kar! G'Kar!

01:23.042 --> 01:26.208
G'Kar! G'Kar! G'Kar! G'Kar!

01:26.292 --> 01:28.375
[continues chanting]

01:34.000 --> 01:35.583
Well, I'd better get going,
I have a meeting

01:35.667 --> 01:37.458
with the president
and Mr. Garibaldi.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.625
- Captain.
- See ya.

01:40.417 --> 01:42.500
[continues chanting]

01:44.583 --> 01:45.833
I..

01:55.917 --> 01:57.292
[beeping]

01:59.375 --> 02:01.167
Yeah?

02:01.250 --> 02:03.833
- Michael, what's up?
- What's up what?

02:03.917 --> 02:05.417
Look, the meeting
is about to start.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.542
No, the meeting's
at, uh, 4 o'clock.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.250
No, the meeting
is at 2:00, Michael.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.500
Now you better get
down here fast.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.417
Sorry, there, uh..

02:17.583 --> 02:20.333
There was a mix-up
about the time.

02:20.417 --> 02:21.542
It's alright.

02:21.625 --> 02:23.583
Since you're already up,
why don't you start?

02:25.208 --> 02:26.875
Well, uh, sure.

02:26.958 --> 02:30.958
Uh, well, there's, uh, no secret

02:31.042 --> 02:33.375
that the, uh, that the,
uh, Drazi didn't mind

02:33.458 --> 02:35.958
the bombing of Centauri Prime.

02:36.042 --> 02:38.583
Since the Minbari, uh..

02:38.667 --> 02:41.583
Since the Centauri are the, uh

02:41.667 --> 02:44.208
main competitors for trade and--

02:44.292 --> 02:46.292
- 'Mr. Garibaldi.'
- Yes, sir?

02:47.708 --> 02:50.958
- You're drunk.
- Mr. President, I..

02:51.042 --> 02:53.292
Delenn, I need to see you
out in the hall for a moment.

02:53.375 --> 02:56.208
The rest of you are dismissed.
We will reconvene later.

03:01.375 --> 03:04.250
Michael, stay.

03:13.417 --> 03:14.833
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

03:14.917 --> 03:16.292
(male #1)
There's a hole in your mind.

03:16.375 --> 03:17.917
(Sinclair)
What do you want?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.875
(G'Kar)
No one here is exactly
what he appears.

03:19.958 --> 03:21.750
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.917
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
(Londo)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn homeworld?

03:26.083 --> 03:28.292
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of the stars.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.917
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.083
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

03:31.167 --> 03:32.500
a decree today declaring..

03:32.583 --> 03:33.792
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us

03:33.875 --> 03:35.417
to declare independence.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.625
Unless your people get off
their encounter

03:36.708 --> 03:37.958
suited butts and do something.

03:38.042 --> 03:39.583
(Zathras)
You're the one who was.

03:39.667 --> 03:42.292
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum,
you will die.

03:42.375 --> 03:43.750
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

03:43.833 --> 03:45.833
Do you have anything
worth living for?

03:45.917 --> 03:47.458
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

03:47.542 --> 03:48.958
(Sheridan)
Giants in the playground.

03:49.042 --> 03:50.417
Now get the hell
out of our galaxy.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.500
We are here to place

03:51.583 --> 03:53.250
President Clark under arrest.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.375
[theme music]

04:54.042 --> 04:56.083
[inaudible]

05:10.917 --> 05:12.667
Please sit.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.042
If you don't mind,
I'd rather stand.

05:16.875 --> 05:18.125
Suit yourself.

05:28.875 --> 05:30.875
So, uh..

05:30.958 --> 05:33.167
...when did you start
drinking again, Michael?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.708
Look, if you're gonna fire me,
please just do it.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.625
Get it over with.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.708
When did you start
drinking again?

05:39.792 --> 05:41.750
I don't know.

05:41.833 --> 05:44.750
Not long ago,
a couple of months.

05:44.833 --> 05:47.000
Yeah, that's just about
what I figured.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.375
You knew?

05:50.458 --> 05:51.542
I suspected.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.542
I worried.

05:55.625 --> 05:57.917
I tried to convince myself
that I was reading too much

05:58.000 --> 06:00.875
into the meetings where
you were late or unprepared.

06:02.083 --> 06:04.000
The recent decline
in your performance.

06:05.458 --> 06:08.542
'You've been under a great deal
of pressure lately.'

06:08.625 --> 06:10.375
Uh, what we went through
at the end of the Civil War

06:10.458 --> 06:14.042
then coming right back here
without even a break in between.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.250
I tried to tell myself
that it was just the strain

06:18.333 --> 06:21.125
of the last year or so.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.125
(Sheridan)
'I didn't know for sure
until today.'

06:24.375 --> 06:25.833
Look, John, you've..

06:25.917 --> 06:28.042
You got every reason
to be angry with me--

06:28.125 --> 06:30.083
I'm not angry with you.
Not now.

06:31.292 --> 06:32.417
I was.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.958
But Delenn has a..

06:38.125 --> 06:40.042
...a way of looking
at things that..

06:42.042 --> 06:46.083
[sighs]
No, no, I'm not angry with you.

06:49.167 --> 06:51.417
But I am very disappointed,
Michael.

06:52.833 --> 06:55.125
I'd rather have you
yelling at me or angry.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.292
Anything but disappointed.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.042
I know I failed--

07:01.125 --> 07:02.500
I didn't say I was disappointed

07:02.583 --> 07:04.375
in you because of your failure.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.417
I'm disappointed because I
didn't pick up on this earlier.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.917
Disappointed because you felt
that you couldn't come to me

07:12.000 --> 07:14.208
about this on your own.

07:14.292 --> 07:17.542
When Stephen had his problem
a couple of years ago

07:17.625 --> 07:20.417
I didn't step forward and offer
my help when I should have

07:20.500 --> 07:22.208
and he damn near died
trying to deal

07:22.292 --> 07:25.542
with his problem on his own.

07:25.625 --> 07:30.000
I have made a lot of mistakes,
same as everybody else.

07:30.083 --> 07:33.208
But I try not to make
the same mistake twice.

07:34.625 --> 07:37.000
So I'm not fired?

07:37.083 --> 07:39.167
I didn't say that.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.667
I can't let this go unanswered.
You know that.

07:47.750 --> 07:51.167
But on your own, the only person

07:51.250 --> 07:54.250
you have to worry about
hurting or helping..

07:55.625 --> 07:57.167
...is yourself.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.292
So, no, you're not fired.

08:01.708 --> 08:04.417
But I am placing you
on suspension.

08:06.292 --> 08:08.417
How long?

08:08.500 --> 08:10.542
Until you work this out.

08:10.625 --> 08:13.375
That could take
a very long time.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.667
It'll take what it takes.

08:21.292 --> 08:23.792
We've had our problems, Michael.

08:27.042 --> 08:29.292
But I am still your friend.

08:31.667 --> 08:33.417
You have to understand
that your problem

08:33.500 --> 08:35.250
is not between you and me.

08:35.333 --> 08:37.708
You and your job or any of that.

08:39.042 --> 08:41.125
Your problem is between you..

08:42.292 --> 08:43.917
...and you.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.292
And when you've
worked this out..

08:50.375 --> 08:52.292
...we'll be here.

08:55.417 --> 08:57.375
[indistinct chatter]

09:01.167 --> 09:03.125
Uh, no, thank you.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.292
I appreciate it, but no.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.875
Alrighty. Thank you.

09:15.708 --> 09:16.958
[beeping]

09:17.042 --> 09:18.875
(G'Kar)
Go away.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.750
(Franklin)
'Uh, G'Kar,
it's, uh, Dr. Franklin.'

09:20.833 --> 09:23.583
'I, I need to speak with you
for a moment, please.'

09:24.458 --> 09:25.625
(G'Kar)
'Enter.'

09:29.542 --> 09:31.000
[indistinct chatter]

09:34.417 --> 09:37.042
Quite a line
you've got out there, G'Kar.

09:37.125 --> 09:39.750
I thought I had
a big waiting room.

09:39.833 --> 09:42.792
I've stopped trying
to count them.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.750
And more come by the hour,
by the minute.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.292
- I don't understand it.
- Well, I do.

09:51.375 --> 09:52.833
I got a call
from your government.

09:52.917 --> 09:54.458
They've been trying to get
a hold of you ever since

09:54.542 --> 09:56.708
you got back, but you're not
taking any calls.

09:56.792 --> 09:58.958
It seemed a simpler way
of achieving a little peace

09:59.042 --> 10:00.958
than hanging myself.

10:01.042 --> 10:03.042
But why did the Kha'ri call you?

10:03.125 --> 10:05.667
Well, doctors are supposed to
get involved in errands of mercy

10:05.750 --> 10:08.000
and that's how
they pitched it to me.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.583
They want me to tell you
that, uh, your homeworld

10:10.667 --> 10:11.792
is up in arms, G'Kar.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.125
Half of them want
you to come home

10:13.208 --> 10:14.583
and take charge
of the whole place.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.250
I told them no before.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.958
My decision stands.

10:21.917 --> 10:22.958
Please.

10:24.417 --> 10:25.500
Thank you.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.125
What do the other half want?

10:30.208 --> 10:31.833
'Well, they want you
to come back long enough'

10:31.917 --> 10:34.042
to give them your blessing
and let them run Narn

10:34.125 --> 10:36.167
on your behalf.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.167
Looks like your popularity back
home has kicked into high gear.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.042
On what basis?

10:41.125 --> 10:43.167
Well, apparently your people
believe that your presence

10:43.250 --> 10:46.375
on Centauri Prime allowed them
to attack without retribution.

10:46.458 --> 10:48.542
You came through it alive,
which they're considering

10:48.625 --> 10:50.917
another not-so-minor miracle

10:51.000 --> 10:52.667
and you don't want the power.

10:52.750 --> 10:53.917
And people love giving power

10:54.000 --> 10:56.042
to those they believe
don't want it.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.708
This is insane.

10:57.792 --> 11:00.042
Yeah, well, that's
as good a word as any.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.792
I spoke with the captain.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.375
She says that more ships are
arriving from Narn every hour

11:05.458 --> 11:07.917
bringing more pilgrims
who want to learn from me.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.958
If I stay here,
we'll be flooded with my people.

11:11.042 --> 11:13.875
If I go home,
they'll make me into..

11:13.958 --> 11:15.917
'...into this.'

11:16.000 --> 11:18.583
Well, that doesn't leave
a lot of options now, does it?

11:18.667 --> 11:20.208
None at all.

11:20.292 --> 11:22.125
I've never understood that.

11:22.208 --> 11:26.083
Why does the universe give us
puzzles with no answers?

11:26.167 --> 11:28.417
Pay back, maybe?

11:28.500 --> 11:30.083
'Evening up the scales
a little?'

11:31.333 --> 11:32.500
The other day
I was thinking about

11:32.583 --> 11:35.000
what you said about God
a few weeks ago

11:35.083 --> 11:37.958
and I remembered
an old human saying.

11:38.042 --> 11:42.375
Can God make a rock so big
that even he can't lift it?

11:42.458 --> 11:43.667
Yes, I've heard it, but--

11:43.750 --> 11:46.167
I wonder
if that's the wrong question?

11:46.250 --> 11:48.833
I wonder
if the right question is

11:48.917 --> 11:52.125
can God create a puzzle
so difficult

11:52.208 --> 11:54.833
a riddle so complex

11:54.917 --> 11:56.958
that even he can't solve it?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.542
What if that's us?

12:02.208 --> 12:04.292
Maybe a problem like
this is God's way

12:04.375 --> 12:06.583
of doing to us a little
of what we do to him?

12:08.958 --> 12:11.375
- Captain?
- Yes, Zack, what is it?

12:11.458 --> 12:12.792
I've got an emergency
transmission

12:12.875 --> 12:14.708
from Earth security HQ
standing by.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.875
I figured
you should be in on it.

12:19.625 --> 12:22.542
Captain, good,
I was just telling Mr. Allan

12:22.625 --> 12:24.958
that we've got a serious
problem on our hands.

12:25.042 --> 12:26.625
During the last month,
there have been

12:26.708 --> 12:29.125
a dozen more attacks
on Psi Corps property.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.833
Bombings, sabotage, you name it.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.625
Now we believe those
responsible are amateurs

12:34.708 --> 12:36.750
but they're making up
for it with resources.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.417
High-tech weapons, munitions

12:38.500 --> 12:40.750
comm systems,
they've got it all.

12:40.833 --> 12:43.292
Well, ma'am, you have my
sympathy, but I really don't see

12:43.375 --> 12:44.875
what you expect us
to do about it.

12:44.958 --> 12:46.250
This is an internal
matter that--

12:46.333 --> 12:48.458
That runs right through
your office, captain.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.833
Point one, at the site
of every bombing

12:50.917 --> 12:52.917
we've found the words
"Remember Byron"

12:53.000 --> 12:54.250
'painted on the walls.'

12:54.333 --> 12:56.167
Now didn't you have
a telepath named Byron

12:56.250 --> 12:57.833
come through Babylon 5 lately

12:57.917 --> 12:59.833
leading a group
of rogue telepaths?

12:59.917 --> 13:01.375
Yes, ma'am,
but that was take--

13:01.458 --> 13:04.583
Point two, we've traced
the money used to purchase

13:04.667 --> 13:05.833
the weapons used
in these attacks

13:05.917 --> 13:07.875
through several shell companies.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.542
The money trail ends
at Babylon 5.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.000
Lyta.

13:13.083 --> 13:14.375
(female #2)
'Now you are under orders'

13:14.458 --> 13:16.542
to detain Lyta Alexander
for questioning.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.250
Arrest her, if necessary

13:18.333 --> 13:20.333
and return her to Earth
for a full inquiry

13:20.417 --> 13:23.042
into her involvement
in these terrorist attacks.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.875
[doorbell chimes]

13:29.958 --> 13:31.083
Yeah, open.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.000
Mr. Garibaldi.

13:37.583 --> 13:40.417
Just thought I'd come by
and see how you're doing.

13:40.500 --> 13:41.583
Me?

13:43.625 --> 13:47.208
I am screwed up one side
and down the other.

13:47.292 --> 13:49.375
This must be a really
great day for you, captain.

13:49.458 --> 13:51.833
You got what you wanted.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.417
I'm history.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.000
Well, the president told me
you were suspended, not fired.

13:56.083 --> 13:57.292
Same difference.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.333
We both know I'm not getting

13:58.417 --> 13:59.667
my job back any time soon

13:59.750 --> 14:01.958
not after all this.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.333
Well, if that's what
you've decided

14:03.417 --> 14:05.292
then that's what's
gonna happen.

14:05.375 --> 14:08.042
But you do have the option
to choose otherwise.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.667
Thanks for the
fortune cookie wisdom.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.500
- Anything else?
- No, not really.

14:13.583 --> 14:17.417
I just thought I'd come by,
offer any help I can and..

14:17.500 --> 14:20.375
...tell you that I understand.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.375
You understand.

14:22.458 --> 14:24.333
And you wanna help.

14:24.417 --> 14:28.208
You? Even after we've
locked horns from day one?

14:29.667 --> 14:31.417
That's right.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.708
'And what makes you think
that you understand?'

14:33.792 --> 14:36.000
What makes you think you know
what I'm going through, captain?

14:36.083 --> 14:38.292
Huh? Please tell me 'cause
I could use a good laugh.

14:41.333 --> 14:42.583
Alright.

14:44.167 --> 14:47.458
- You're angry.
- Bravo, Miss Holmes.

14:47.542 --> 14:51.417
A masterpiece of investigative
work, please, go on.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.958
Because you feel like you're
alone, you need that anger

14:54.042 --> 14:58.625
to, to push away anybody whose
compassion might contradict you.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.458
'Because you feel like
you're not in control anymore.'

15:00.542 --> 15:03.000
Hey, you may as well go
even further out of control.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.542
And because you can't hurt
the people who hurt you

15:05.625 --> 15:08.792
like Bester, you've got to
lash out at everybody else.

15:10.708 --> 15:14.292
See, the drinking gives
a control freak like you

15:14.375 --> 15:15.958
permission to let it go.

15:16.042 --> 15:19.042
To, to be angry,
to lash out, to lose it.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.625
Did you get that
out of a book?

15:20.708 --> 15:24.167
Was it a psychology text or was
it one of those pop-up books?

15:24.250 --> 15:26.333
Mr. Garibaldi..

15:26.417 --> 15:29.083
- My father was an alcoholic.
- I am not an--

15:29.167 --> 15:31.375
When he was drunk,
he used to lash out at us

15:31.458 --> 15:33.583
just like you're lashing
out at me right now.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.875
He wasn't mad at us.
He was mad at himself.

15:36.958 --> 15:41.042
At what he was, at-at the walls
that were closing in around him.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.583
And because he was
career military

15:43.667 --> 15:46.417
he thought he had to keep
it buttoned up.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.667
Shirts pressed, chin up

15:47.750 --> 15:49.667
yes, sir, no, sir,
nothing in-between.

15:49.750 --> 15:53.417
Doesn't matter what you feel,
you keep it down.

15:53.500 --> 15:57.625
See, the alcohol gave him
permission to let go.

15:57.708 --> 16:00.000
And what was he
angry about, huh?

16:02.042 --> 16:04.708
At the time, I didn't know.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.708
Hey, I was just a kid,
how the hell was I supposed

16:06.792 --> 16:08.625
to understand any of this?

16:08.708 --> 16:12.208
I figured it was,
it was my fault somehow.

16:12.292 --> 16:15.583
So I was always trying
to fix whatever it was.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.042
Nothing worked.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.667
And after a while

16:18.750 --> 16:22.292
I got so frustrated, so hurt

16:22.375 --> 16:24.083
that I ran away from home.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.792
Which just confirmed
his suspicions.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.208
The same ones you've got.

16:27.292 --> 16:28.625
And what are those?

16:28.708 --> 16:30.375
'That you're a failure.'

16:30.458 --> 16:32.292
That you're not good enough
to handle the job

16:32.375 --> 16:34.417
and you've got no business
being here.

16:34.500 --> 16:36.500
I'll tell you what, captain.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.125
I've got a few things
to do around here

16:38.208 --> 16:41.083
so why don't you just leave?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.292
- Not until I'm finished.
- Get out.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.167
- No.
- Fine. Then I'm gonna leave.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.542
- Hey.
- What is wrong with you?

16:53.625 --> 16:55.583
- Can't you take a hint?
- I'm not finished yet.

16:55.667 --> 16:57.542
Besides, you're just walking
away to see if I'll follow you.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.750
Why don't you stop
trying to tell me

16:58.833 --> 17:00.417
what the hell I think,
alright?

17:00.500 --> 17:02.625
Okay, then I'll tell you
a little more about my father.

17:04.042 --> 17:05.083
Green 2.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.667
After my mother died

17:09.750 --> 17:11.500
I was the one who had
to go through the house

17:11.583 --> 17:14.208
and figure out what to sell,
what to keep.

17:14.292 --> 17:15.458
While I was going
through the attic

17:15.542 --> 17:17.292
I came across some paintings

17:17.375 --> 17:18.917
landscapes, portraits.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.958
Beautiful work.

17:21.042 --> 17:23.875
I looked at the signature and..

17:23.958 --> 17:25.750
...they'd been painted
by my father.

17:27.208 --> 17:28.958
It was the one thing he loved

17:29.042 --> 17:31.083
almost as much
as he loved my mother.

17:32.875 --> 17:34.333
He never wanted to be
in the military.

17:34.417 --> 17:37.333
He just, he just did it because
everybody expected him to

17:37.417 --> 17:40.500
like his father
and his father before that.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.333
He stopped painting
the day he enlisted.

17:44.792 --> 17:47.125
But he wanted to paint.
He was good at it.

17:48.875 --> 17:53.292
And it was killing him not to,
one drink at a time.

17:55.167 --> 17:56.458
[elevator dings]

17:58.542 --> 18:02.333
He didn't see any way out of his
life, any way to change it.

18:02.417 --> 18:04.750
But the door's
always there, Michael.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.583
You just have to open it.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.708
Okay, fine,
so you had a hard life

18:08.792 --> 18:10.417
and your old man had
some real life problems.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.333
But that doesn't mean
that you understand

18:12.417 --> 18:13.917
what I'm going through.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.167
In all the time
that you've been here

18:15.250 --> 18:17.167
I've never even seen you
take a drink.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.500
No, you haven't.

18:19.583 --> 18:22.958
Because I've got the same exact
damn problem you've got.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.500
I-I, I didn't--

18:28.583 --> 18:30.542
'No. no, of course, you didn't.'

18:30.625 --> 18:32.208
You see

18:32.292 --> 18:34.750
children of alcoholics usually
end up one of two ways.

18:34.833 --> 18:37.333
Either they, they try
to help everybody else

18:37.417 --> 18:39.667
because they couldn't
help themselves

18:39.750 --> 18:43.333
or they become alcoholics.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.750
'I couldn't stop what was
happening to my father.'

18:46.750 --> 18:49.542
So I became
the very thing I hated.

18:51.292 --> 18:54.708
Oh, if it could
be swallowed, shot

18:54.792 --> 18:57.458
or smoked, oh, I did it.

18:57.542 --> 19:00.708
Until somebody
very close to me died.

19:00.792 --> 19:03.708
Then I realized
what I was doing.

19:03.792 --> 19:06.000
After that,
I tried to get better.

19:07.458 --> 19:09.542
And it hasn't been easy.

19:09.625 --> 19:12.042
Every day is a struggle.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.667
So if you think I don't know
what you're feeling, mister

19:14.750 --> 19:16.792
you're wrong.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.375
You're dead wrong.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.375
[dings]

19:23.083 --> 19:25.917
Maybe that's why we didn't
get along from day one.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.333
Maybe we recognized
too much of ourselves

19:28.417 --> 19:29.625
in the other person.

19:32.667 --> 19:34.375
I couldn't help my father.

19:34.458 --> 19:36.917
And I couldn't help myself
at the time, but..

19:37.000 --> 19:40.625
...maybe I can help you
the only way I know how.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.375
By telling you all that.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.833
At least you know
you're not alone.

19:46.333 --> 19:47.458
Everything else..

19:48.875 --> 19:50.500
...is up to you.

19:52.417 --> 19:54.042
Sorry to be late.
Sheridan here?

19:54.125 --> 19:55.375
No, not yet.

19:55.458 --> 19:56.542
Oh, he said he wanted to be

19:56.625 --> 19:58.500
here when we arrested her.

19:58.583 --> 20:00.500
Well, we can't wait forever.
Where is she?

20:00.583 --> 20:02.042
Over there.

20:02.125 --> 20:04.167
'The guy she's talking
to is Wolfgang Schneider.'

20:04.250 --> 20:05.375
'An arms dealer.'

20:05.458 --> 20:06.417
'Works with the Narns a lot'

20:06.500 --> 20:08.542
but strictly freelance.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.917
Pretty blatant, meeting out
in the open like this.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.292
Probably means she's not worried
about interference from us.

20:14.375 --> 20:18.125
Oh, if that doesn't worry you,
it scares the hell out of me.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.542
Alright, everybody in place?

20:19.625 --> 20:22.208
Yeah, parked and ready to go.

20:22.292 --> 20:24.958
- Let's go.
- Alright, follow us in.

20:31.917 --> 20:34.208
(Lochley)
'Lyta? We need to talk to you.'

20:35.917 --> 20:38.083
Go ahead.
I'll catch up with you later.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.292
We'd like you to come with us.

20:43.375 --> 20:44.875
Am I under arrest, Zack?

20:44.958 --> 20:47.000
We just need you
to answer some questions.

20:47.083 --> 20:48.958
Now we can do this
any way you like.

20:49.042 --> 20:51.042
But if we have to arrest you,
that's what we'll do.

20:52.458 --> 20:53.875
What's the charge?

20:53.958 --> 20:57.458
Aiding and abetting terrorist
activities back home.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.542
'Look, there's no reason
to make a scene here.'

21:00.625 --> 21:03.125
Just come with us.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.958
What if I don't wanna go?

21:05.042 --> 21:07.208
I don't think you have
a lot of choice.

21:07.292 --> 21:09.833
Are you sure
about that, captain?

21:09.917 --> 21:11.958
[tapping]

21:24.833 --> 21:25.875
Lyta.

21:25.958 --> 21:27.167
[thumping]

21:27.250 --> 21:30.250
I'm tired of being pushed
around, captain.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.500
[synchronized thumping]

21:45.125 --> 21:48.167
I do not choose to be arrested.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.417
I've done a lot for this place.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.042
And just once
I think a little gratitude

21:54.125 --> 21:55.375
would be in order, don't you?

21:55.458 --> 21:58.542
- Lyta, don't force us to--
- To what?

21:58.625 --> 22:00.208
Zack?

22:03.208 --> 22:04.542
You cannot harm me.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.917
You cannot stop someone
who's been touched by Vorlons.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.583
You're not the only one that's
been touched by the Vorlons.

22:18.833 --> 22:20.042
Let them go.

22:22.042 --> 22:25.167
Let them go or I'll blow
the back of your skull off.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.167
[indistinct chatter]

22:38.667 --> 22:40.708
You can't be everywhere,
Mr. President.

22:42.333 --> 22:43.458
Good point.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.708
[grunts]

22:45.792 --> 22:49.000
Get her out of here
and put her in Level 1 lockup.

22:51.667 --> 22:52.917
I hate myself for saying this

22:53.000 --> 22:54.542
but maybe you should've pulled

22:54.625 --> 22:56.833
the trigger while you could.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.833
You may not get another chance.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.958
(Garibaldi)
Captain?

23:05.042 --> 23:06.333
Captain, I've
been looking for you.

23:06.417 --> 23:09.458
I, uh, I heard about
what happened with Lyta.

23:09.542 --> 23:12.083
Oh, yeah, what the hell's going
on with her, anyway?

23:12.167 --> 23:13.750
Her attitude and her abilities?

23:13.833 --> 23:16.042
Getting more destructive
every day.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.708
I don't know,
maybe they're linked somehow.

23:17.792 --> 23:20.667
You know, the angrier she gets,
the more her abilities increase?

23:20.750 --> 23:22.208
Maybe it's the other way around.

23:22.292 --> 23:23.958
Oh, she's been
through hell lately

23:24.042 --> 23:26.042
and maybe just hit
the end of the road.

23:26.125 --> 23:27.958
Great, so now what
do I do with her?

23:28.042 --> 23:30.167
I can't keep her
locked up indefinitely.

23:30.250 --> 23:33.208
And if I try to send her home,
it'll be a bloodbath.

23:33.292 --> 23:34.458
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

23:34.542 --> 23:35.583
There's something
you should see.

23:35.667 --> 23:38.125
Uh, before we do that.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.417
The reason that I was looking
for you was

23:40.500 --> 23:42.583
well, I, I just want
to say I'm sorry

23:42.667 --> 23:43.833
for yelling at you earlier.

23:43.917 --> 23:45.667
I, I know how hard
that must've been for you

23:45.750 --> 23:48.708
and I appreciate what you said
and why you said it.

23:48.792 --> 23:50.000
I don't know what
I'm gonna do about it yet

23:50.083 --> 23:54.292
but, uh, I just
wanted to say thanks.

23:56.292 --> 23:57.292
Yeah.

23:58.667 --> 23:59.958
Okay.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.625
Okay, I'll bite.

24:05.708 --> 24:08.458
- What am I looking for?
- 'Michael.'

24:09.708 --> 24:10.750
Lise?

24:10.833 --> 24:12.000
Oh!

24:12.083 --> 24:15.000
I came as soon
as I got your message.

24:15.083 --> 24:16.458
There's nothing like
the love of a good woman

24:16.542 --> 24:19.042
to keep your spirits up,
is there, Mr. Garibaldi?

24:20.500 --> 24:22.583
What, uh, part of my message
did you get?

24:22.667 --> 24:25.292
We've been having trouble
with the comm system, see, and..

24:25.375 --> 24:26.708
The most important part.

24:26.792 --> 24:28.833
The part that said I need you.

24:29.958 --> 24:31.375
And you came here
just on that.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.083
What more is there?

24:35.583 --> 24:38.333
Mmm, oh, it's good to see you.

24:40.042 --> 24:41.375
Mmm.

24:45.958 --> 24:48.417
I just heard the news.
Is that her?

24:48.500 --> 24:50.708
Yeah, we put her in
the brig furthest away

24:50.792 --> 24:54.208
from any human contact and put
the system on auto-maintenance.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.750
Now, that should make it
harder for her

24:55.833 --> 24:58.333
to influence anyone
to let her out. Water?

24:58.417 --> 24:59.708
No. No, thanks.

24:59.792 --> 25:02.208
I just don't
understand it, Stephen.

25:02.292 --> 25:04.917
What could make her
turn like this?

25:05.000 --> 25:07.250
Well, let's see,
she was, uh

25:07.333 --> 25:09.917
adjusted by the Vorlons,
dumped by the Vorlons

25:10.000 --> 25:12.708
used as a weapon.
Quit the corps.

25:12.792 --> 25:13.958
Lost the only man she ever loved

25:14.042 --> 25:16.583
and dedicated herself
to finishing his work.

25:16.667 --> 25:18.333
Pick one or all of the above.

25:18.417 --> 25:19.708
Let's face it, she's pissed.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.917
Mmm, massively.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.583
No, there's something
more going on here.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.667
Something that pushed
her over the edge.

25:28.167 --> 25:30.542
I mean, first Londo,
then Garibaldi, and now this.

25:31.958 --> 25:34.458
I tell you, the next person
who acts irrationally

25:34.542 --> 25:36.583
I swear I'm gonna shoot
myself in the head.

25:36.667 --> 25:37.833
Bastards!

25:40.000 --> 25:41.583
- Did she just--
- She did.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.917
- I'll get the gun.
- Delenn, are you--

25:44.042 --> 25:46.917
- Bastards!
- Yeah, we got that part.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.125
The Narn government says
they're going to boycott

25:49.208 --> 25:51.708
all our ships
until G'Kar comes home.

25:51.792 --> 25:54.708
Well, that's not our choice.
He doesn't wanna go home.

25:54.792 --> 25:58.583
They say he's staying here
out of a sense of obligation.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.833
And that if we tell him
to go home, he will.

26:00.917 --> 26:04.625
- They're insane.
- I know, and I just, I..

26:04.708 --> 26:06.917
I don't think I can, I..

26:08.375 --> 26:10.500
- I can..
- Delenn?

26:14.208 --> 26:15.458
Franklin to Medlab 1.

26:15.542 --> 26:18.250
We need a trauma team,
Sheridan's office, stat.

26:19.750 --> 26:23.667
And, the bottom line is,
I'm suspended indefinitely.

26:23.750 --> 26:27.125
- Till I get it worked out.
- 'Michael, it doesn't matter.'

26:27.208 --> 26:29.667
(Lise)
'You were gonna leave
at the end of the year anyway.'

26:29.750 --> 26:31.292
At least that's what
you told me.

26:31.375 --> 26:32.958
Did you mean it?

26:33.042 --> 26:36.333
Of course, I meant it.
That doesn't change anything.

26:37.542 --> 26:40.000
[sighs]
I messed up, Lise.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.875
I messed up more than
I've ever messed anything up

26:41.958 --> 26:45.083
in my whole damn life and I
don't know what to do about it.

26:46.042 --> 26:48.208
I'm gonna try and sober up.

26:48.292 --> 26:49.458
I know I can do it.

26:51.167 --> 26:53.333
It may take a while,
it may take a long while.

26:54.625 --> 26:57.083
So what am I supposed
to do in the meantime?

26:57.167 --> 26:58.500
Come back to Mars with me.

26:58.583 --> 27:01.125
No, no, I, I can't do that

27:01.208 --> 27:02.625
not until I get my act together.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.375
Not until I get it alright.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.667
Well, then you may
as well give up

27:06.750 --> 27:09.958
because nobody
gets it 100 percent right.

27:10.042 --> 27:13.333
I just wanna give you
a normal life.

27:14.292 --> 27:17.208
There is no normal life,
Michael.

27:17.292 --> 27:18.542
There's just life.

27:20.333 --> 27:21.375
I know you have a problem

27:21.458 --> 27:23.708
but we can work
through it together.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.708
The hell with this job, Michael.

27:26.792 --> 27:28.250
I need you.

27:28.333 --> 27:29.458
I'm still trying to get a handle

27:29.542 --> 27:31.417
on running Edgars Industries.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.375
There's a lot going on,
a lot I don't understand

27:34.458 --> 27:37.208
a lot I don't wanna understand.

27:37.292 --> 27:39.708
You can be a huge help to me.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.292
And I can help you.

27:42.583 --> 27:44.750
That's what married couples do.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.333
You, um..

27:49.125 --> 27:51.458
You still wanna go
through with this?

27:51.542 --> 27:54.917
More than anything
in my entire life.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.792
I lost you twice, Michael.

28:09.875 --> 28:12.792
I have no intention
of losing you again.

28:14.833 --> 28:17.375
I'm offering you love..

28:17.458 --> 28:19.917
...and passion..

28:20.000 --> 28:22.042
...and co-ownership
of one of the biggest

28:22.125 --> 28:23.625
corporations on Mars.

28:23.708 --> 28:24.917
Mmm.

28:27.292 --> 28:29.292
What do you say?

28:29.375 --> 28:32.250
I'd say that the president
just got outbid.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.375
Hmm.

28:38.333 --> 28:39.875
Yeah.

28:40.833 --> 28:41.833
Yeah.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.500
One of the biggest
corporations on Mars.

28:49.583 --> 28:52.042
Michael, where are you going?

28:52.125 --> 28:54.333
To kill two teeps
with one stone.

28:57.792 --> 29:00.000
- Well, how is she?
- She's stable for now.

29:00.083 --> 29:01.917
Only time will tell
if her system can adjust

29:02.000 --> 29:03.917
to handle the stress
she's putting on it.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.542
That's why she, uh,
just shut down like that.

29:07.625 --> 29:10.792
Look, you have to understand
she's a Minbari-human hybrid.

29:10.875 --> 29:12.667
Things aren't gonna
work the same.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.500
Wait, wh-what are you
talking about?

29:14.583 --> 29:16.250
What is wrong with her?

29:17.542 --> 29:18.958
She's pregnant.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.667
Pregnant.

29:30.750 --> 29:34.333
I, I didn't even know she could.

29:34.417 --> 29:37.500
I thought you said that the
blood tests were inconclusive.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.167
No, I said that I didn't know

29:39.250 --> 29:42.208
if the two of you could
ever have children.

29:42.292 --> 29:44.458
We're in uncharted terrain,
John.

29:44.542 --> 29:47.667
Now, I figured the odds
were 100 to one against

29:47.750 --> 29:50.292
which, I guess, goes to show you
I wasn't born to gamble.

29:52.417 --> 29:54.250
Do you want the child?

29:54.333 --> 29:56.708
Will she be okay? Uh..

29:56.792 --> 29:58.042
I mean, you said
this is putting

29:58.125 --> 30:01.208
a, a terrible strain
on her system.

30:01.292 --> 30:04.958
Uh, will she be able to carry it
full term and survive?

30:05.042 --> 30:06.125
I don't know.

30:07.375 --> 30:09.042
Sh-she's young.

30:09.125 --> 30:10.292
She's in good shape.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.292
She's strong-willed,
that's for sure.

30:14.042 --> 30:18.042
If you're asking for a yes or no
answer, I can't give you one.

30:18.125 --> 30:19.875
The odds are good.

30:19.958 --> 30:22.625
But as we just saw,
I have been wrong before.

30:23.958 --> 30:26.667
If I have to choose
between the baby and her..

30:29.417 --> 30:30.542
...it's her.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.458
But if I can have both..

30:37.583 --> 30:39.000
...I want both.

30:44.208 --> 30:45.833
I know she'd want it.

30:59.875 --> 31:01.208
Hello, Lyta.

31:03.292 --> 31:05.250
Just wanna stop by
and see how you were doing.

31:06.917 --> 31:09.083
In case you're wondering,
I, uh..

31:09.167 --> 31:10.500
...I don't have
any access codes.

31:10.583 --> 31:11.917
I don't have any way
to get you out of here

31:12.000 --> 31:16.042
so we might as well
just both...relax.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.000
Right?

31:19.417 --> 31:20.583
I'm, uh..

31:22.542 --> 31:23.667
I'm just gonna..

31:25.833 --> 31:26.875
...sit over here..

31:28.417 --> 31:29.917
...and, uh..

31:30.958 --> 31:32.792
We can talk, okay?

31:36.542 --> 31:39.375
They, uh, tell me that you're
having problems back home.

31:40.875 --> 31:43.250
I know you think you can fight
your way out of it, but..

31:43.333 --> 31:44.667
...you're not gonna
be able to do any good

31:44.750 --> 31:45.625
if they keep you drugged

31:45.708 --> 31:48.500
during stasis for the trip home.

31:48.583 --> 31:49.958
Once they got you back..

31:51.583 --> 31:53.833
I sure would hate to visit
Psi Corps headquarters

31:53.917 --> 31:56.958
and see bits of you floating
around in jars of formaldehyde.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.375
'I think I can help you, Lyta.'

32:02.083 --> 32:03.542
I can help you and..

32:05.417 --> 32:06.667
...and you can help me.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.500
Now if you're interested,
I'll try and get us transferred

32:09.583 --> 32:11.458
to another cell
where we can talk privately

32:11.542 --> 32:14.208
without having that camera watch
over us the whole time.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.458
- What camera?
- Right.

32:24.958 --> 32:26.000
Okay.

32:26.917 --> 32:28.417
Okay, here's my proposition.

32:30.417 --> 32:31.500
We know that you've
been funneling money

32:31.583 --> 32:32.750
to the underground back home

32:32.833 --> 32:35.167
and in turn,
hitting the Psi Corps.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.333
You're doing it
because you don't like

32:36.417 --> 32:37.333
what they've done to you

32:37.417 --> 32:39.250
and the other telepaths.

32:39.333 --> 32:41.708
Well, we've got
something in common.

32:41.792 --> 32:44.500
Because I don't like
what they've done to me.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.708
They messed with my mind
and Bester planted

32:46.792 --> 32:48.667
a neural block in my head
that keeps me from nailin'

32:48.750 --> 32:50.958
that sucker's head to the wall.

32:51.042 --> 32:53.958
That, and, um, a few other
things that have happened lately

32:54.042 --> 32:57.292
have caused me a few problems.

32:59.958 --> 33:02.875
- You're drinking again.
- Yeah.

33:02.958 --> 33:04.917
'I can't help you.'

33:05.000 --> 33:07.083
Even I can't get rid
of an addiction.

33:08.458 --> 33:10.500
There's no easy solutions.

33:10.583 --> 33:11.625
I know.

33:12.667 --> 33:14.042
Believe me, I do.

33:15.458 --> 33:18.042
But there is one thing
that you can do.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.542
You can take out
Bester's neural block.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.083
That's when all my problems
started to happen again.

33:23.167 --> 33:24.750
I mean, if you give me
the freedom to get back at him

33:24.833 --> 33:26.958
then maybe, just maybe,
I might have a chance

33:27.042 --> 33:29.875
to get a little control
over my life again.

33:29.958 --> 33:31.458
And in return?

33:31.542 --> 33:34.250
I can have a very influential
corporation talk to Earth

33:34.333 --> 33:36.458
on your behalf
to drop the charges.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.375
But I'd have to leave Babylon 5
and not come back.

33:42.833 --> 33:45.417
That would have to be the deal.

33:45.500 --> 33:46.792
It's not enough.

33:51.667 --> 33:54.250
How much is your revenge
worth to you, Michael?

33:54.333 --> 33:56.167
I told you this isn't
about revenge, Lyta.

33:56.250 --> 34:00.250
I am just trying to get back
in control of my life again.

34:00.333 --> 34:02.583
Of course.

34:02.667 --> 34:06.208
In that case, I have
a counter proposal for you.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.708
(Michael)
'Of course, we wouldn't be
in this situation'

34:12.792 --> 34:15.083
'if G'Kar hadn't given Lyta
a hell of a lot of money'

34:15.167 --> 34:18.042
'in exchange for her
giving the Narns telepath DNA.'

34:18.125 --> 34:20.042
Well, that's still
only a rumor, Michael.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.625
And even if it's true,
Narn internal affairs

34:22.708 --> 34:25.042
are strictly off-limits
to the Alliance.

34:25.125 --> 34:26.292
Oh, it's true, alright.

34:26.375 --> 34:27.458
Look all the transactions
have been

34:27.542 --> 34:28.500
placed in a secret account

34:28.583 --> 34:30.125
and only she has
the access code.

34:30.208 --> 34:33.125
Now, she's agreed to transfer
the money into a secret fund

34:33.208 --> 34:35.583
that's gonna be used
exclusively to help telepaths.

34:35.667 --> 34:37.042
No more blowing stuff up.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.833
Ledgers will be kept,
accounts will be balanced.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.583
The books will be made
available for review

34:40.667 --> 34:42.833
by anybody who wants
to see them anytime.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.958
Now who's gonna supervise
this trust fund?

34:45.042 --> 34:46.792
She's given me authority
to pick someone.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.583
Now, captain,
I give you my word.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.833
Every penny in that fund
will be accounted for.

34:50.917 --> 34:52.667
Alright, assuming this is true,
I still don't have

34:52.750 --> 34:53.958
the authority to let her go.

34:54.042 --> 34:55.458
'You'll have it by the end
of the day'

34:55.542 --> 34:57.292
because there's a certain
senator who receives

34:57.375 --> 34:59.625
a fairly large campaign
contribution every year

34:59.708 --> 35:03.292
from Edgars Industries who is
gonna intercede on her behalf.

35:03.375 --> 35:05.167
Okay, once she's out
of the brig, then what?

35:05.250 --> 35:07.750
I, I can't just let her
wander around Babylon-5

35:07.833 --> 35:09.500
in her current state.

35:09.583 --> 35:12.167
She is extremely powerful,
very dangerous

35:12.250 --> 35:14.750
and, for my money, unstable.

35:14.833 --> 35:17.167
I just happened to catch the
last part of your discussion

35:17.250 --> 35:19.167
and I believe
we have a common solution

35:19.250 --> 35:21.458
to our respective problems.

35:21.542 --> 35:24.542
Well, alright, let's hear it.

35:24.625 --> 35:27.708
This is how I've come
to be seen by my people.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.917
Despite my best efforts,
I've become an icon.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.375
'I didn't understand
why or how until I saw this.'

35:34.458 --> 35:37.333
I realized it's simpler
to make a statue to someone

35:37.417 --> 35:39.542
who you believe embodies
all your better qualities

35:39.625 --> 35:42.375
than it is to actually
improve yourself.

35:42.458 --> 35:44.417
And this saves you
from having to think.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.208
Exactly.

35:46.292 --> 35:48.625
For the last year,
I've tried to point my people

35:48.708 --> 35:53.333
toward the simple truth that
we are one regardless of race.

35:53.417 --> 35:55.542
Somehow, that message
has gotten twisted

35:55.625 --> 35:59.000
so that I have become their idea
of the truth personified.

35:59.083 --> 36:03.375
Once you turn into this, you can
no longer be who you are.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.042
You can only be what
they want you to be

36:05.125 --> 36:08.125
what they expect you to be.

36:08.208 --> 36:11.583
If I return, they will try
to make me into this

36:11.667 --> 36:13.750
'and I cannot allow that.'

36:13.833 --> 36:16.083
If I stay here,
my followers will continue

36:16.167 --> 36:18.375
to disrupt Babylon 5.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.333
Is that not true, captain?

36:20.417 --> 36:23.250
I hate to say it,
but yes, that's correct.

36:23.333 --> 36:26.083
So you see, Lyta and I
are in the same position.

36:26.167 --> 36:28.167
Neither of us can go home
and neither of us

36:28.250 --> 36:30.125
can stay here any longer.

36:30.208 --> 36:32.083
Then where do you go?

36:32.167 --> 36:33.917
Out there.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.083
Visiting Centauri Prime
helped me

36:36.167 --> 36:38.000
understand the Centauri.

36:38.083 --> 36:41.542
And out of that came a new peace
between our people.

36:41.625 --> 36:45.917
I also realized that there is
so much I have never seen.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.458
How much more
could I understand?

36:48.542 --> 36:50.000
How much more
could I help my people

36:50.083 --> 36:53.208
if I saw even more
of the universe around us?

36:54.667 --> 36:57.292
I could destroy this
by betraying my principles.

36:58.625 --> 37:00.125
But I can't do that.

37:01.542 --> 37:04.125
So I have decided to go away.

37:04.208 --> 37:08.125
I will return when I've found
a way to destroy this

37:08.208 --> 37:11.167
while keeping
the message intact.

37:11.250 --> 37:12.333
What about Lyta?

37:12.417 --> 37:14.958
I could use
a traveling companion.

37:15.042 --> 37:16.292
I have learned a great deal

37:16.375 --> 37:19.583
about healing wounds
and curing anger.

37:19.667 --> 37:22.625
Perhaps, in my way, I can help
her deal with her own anger

37:22.708 --> 37:24.583
as I dealt with mine.

37:24.667 --> 37:27.667
Either way, as soon as
I put my affairs in order

37:27.750 --> 37:29.875
I am leaving Babylon 5.

37:29.958 --> 37:33.250
And it is entirely possible
that I may never return.

37:38.417 --> 37:40.500
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.

37:40.583 --> 37:41.667
Did you talk with the captain?

37:41.750 --> 37:43.083
Yes, I did.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.167
Did she go for the deal?

37:45.250 --> 37:47.333
Uh, yeah.

37:47.417 --> 37:49.500
Yeah, she did.

37:49.583 --> 37:53.167
Oh, it, uh, it turns out
that G'Kar's leaving too.

37:53.250 --> 37:54.708
You know, it's funny, with..

37:54.792 --> 37:56.708
With him leaving
and taking Lyta with him

37:56.792 --> 37:59.167
and Franklin taking
a job back on Earth

37:59.250 --> 38:02.167
me leaving soon, Londo gone.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.042
Hell, even Sheridan's
heading off

38:04.125 --> 38:05.625
to Minbar with Delenn
as soon as he gets

38:05.708 --> 38:08.833
the new facilities
for the Alliance in order.

38:08.917 --> 38:11.750
I don't know, it just, uh..

38:11.833 --> 38:15.083
It doesn't seem like this place
is gonna be the same anymore.

38:16.542 --> 38:18.042
Life is change.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.750
It's a good thing.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.375
What matters is you've
taken the first step

38:23.458 --> 38:25.458
to putting your life
back together.

38:27.500 --> 38:29.125
You made a good deal.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.750
Get ready for bed.
You look exhausted.

38:39.625 --> 38:41.042
[sighs]

38:44.625 --> 38:45.875
Oh, yeah.

38:50.333 --> 38:52.708
I made a good deal.

38:52.792 --> 38:55.458
(Lyta)
I have
a counter proposal for you.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.333
I've done everything
I could, Michael.

38:58.417 --> 39:01.042
I, I raised money
to help fight the Psi Corps

39:01.125 --> 39:04.000
but the way they tracked it
back to me shows I don't have

39:04.083 --> 39:06.917
the background to know
how to use it.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.292
You do.

39:09.792 --> 39:13.917
With Edgars Industries,
you've got resources, contacts

39:14.000 --> 39:15.917
and a way to move
large amounts of money

39:16.000 --> 39:18.375
without attracting attention.

39:19.167 --> 39:20.708
So here's my deal.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.583
We'll set up two accounts.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.250
The first one's for show.

39:26.333 --> 39:30.417
The second one is the real
account, the big one.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.375
Use that money to hurt
the Psi Corps

39:32.458 --> 39:34.000
and help my people.

39:34.083 --> 39:36.250
You can't hurt Bester directly
because of the neural block

39:36.333 --> 39:40.125
but you can help me bring down
everything he cares about.

39:40.208 --> 39:41.958
You can help me
destroy the Psi Corps

39:42.042 --> 39:44.042
and free my people.

39:44.125 --> 39:46.833
Well, why not just remove
the neural block?

39:46.917 --> 39:49.917
Because it's a great motivator.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.042
You won't rest until it's gone
and I'm the only hope you've got

39:53.125 --> 39:55.417
of ever gettin' rid of it.

39:57.542 --> 40:01.125
I'll check back with you
after two years.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.625
If you've done as I ask,
if you've created a force

40:03.708 --> 40:05.333
I can use against the Corps..

40:08.083 --> 40:10.667
...I'll take out
that neural block.

40:10.750 --> 40:13.250
Then you can deal with Bester.

40:13.333 --> 40:15.917
I'll deal with the Corps.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.708
We both get what we want.

40:17.792 --> 40:20.417
Aren't you taking
an awful chance?

40:20.500 --> 40:22.417
I could just grab
the money and run.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.625
I don't believe you'd do that.

40:24.708 --> 40:28.417
If I thought otherwise,
I'd kill you where you stand.

40:30.458 --> 40:31.500
How?

40:35.375 --> 40:36.500
My turn.

40:38.333 --> 40:40.417
You want me as a partner?

40:40.500 --> 40:42.500
Then I have to be
in all the way.

40:43.583 --> 40:45.333
So I need to know, Lyta.

40:45.417 --> 40:46.750
Something's happened
to your abilities.

40:46.833 --> 40:49.833
You're not a P5 anymore.
Hell, you're not even a P12.

40:49.917 --> 40:52.458
You're the strongest telepath
that I've ever seen.

40:54.375 --> 40:56.458
What did the Vorlons
do to you, Lyta?

40:57.250 --> 40:58.250
Who..

40:59.583 --> 41:00.708
What are you?

41:04.417 --> 41:07.292
I've only recently begun
to understand it myself.

41:09.250 --> 41:11.333
You know the Vorlons used
telepaths as weapons

41:11.417 --> 41:13.917
during the Shadow War,
but what no one stopped

41:14.000 --> 41:16.250
to consider was that in a war

41:16.333 --> 41:18.542
you have a certain number
of small weapons

41:18.625 --> 41:21.708
a certain number
of medium-size weapons..

41:21.792 --> 41:24.750
...and one or two big ones..

41:24.833 --> 41:26.875
...the kind of weapons
you drop when you're..

41:26.958 --> 41:29.917
...out of the small weapons
and the medium weapons

41:30.000 --> 41:33.417
and you've got
nothin' left to use.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.208
Someone like that would..

41:39.125 --> 41:42.750
...be the telepathic equivalent
of a thermonuclear device

41:42.833 --> 41:46.792
a...a doomsday weapon.

41:50.542 --> 41:53.083
Pleased to meet you,
Mr. Garibaldi.

42:07.750 --> 42:08.750
[sighs]

42:13.500 --> 42:16.042
Stop staring at me.

42:16.125 --> 42:18.042
I'm sorry.
I couldn't help it.

42:18.125 --> 42:19.625
One would think
you have never seen

42:19.708 --> 42:22.542
a pregnant half-human
half-Minbari before.

42:24.625 --> 42:25.875
Oh.

42:27.167 --> 42:28.917
So why weren't you sleeping?

42:30.083 --> 42:32.500
I was just laying
here and thinking.

42:32.583 --> 42:35.917
We haven't heard a word
from Londo since we came back.

42:37.208 --> 42:38.958
I find I miss him.

42:39.042 --> 42:40.458
He's probably just busy.

42:40.542 --> 42:43.542
He's got a lot
of responsibilities now.

42:43.625 --> 42:45.583
He'll have to adjust
to being emperor

42:45.667 --> 42:47.958
like I had to adjust
to my new job.

42:48.042 --> 42:49.333
I'm sure that's all.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.667
Hell, he's probably still
celebrating his coronation..

42:55.750 --> 42:58.000
...partying all night.

42:58.083 --> 43:00.125
I hope so.

43:00.208 --> 43:02.875
I hope he's alright, John.

43:02.958 --> 43:04.750
I really do.

43:08.292 --> 43:11.208
