Previously on "Major Crimes"...

00:01.347 --> 00:03.628
I have something called cardiomyopathy.

00:03.653 --> 00:05.586
But until I know more,

00:05.588 --> 00:09.223
I think we should postpone the wedding.

00:09.225 --> 00:10.458
Absolutely not.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.493
Three teenage boys go missing

00:12.495 --> 00:14.362
from a school field trip,
then one of them

00:14.364 --> 00:16.297
winds up back at school, dead.

00:16.299 --> 00:17.865
Where are the other two boys?

00:17.867 --> 00:20.034
Earlier today, Miguel Diaz and Ryan Rojas

00:20.036 --> 00:21.636
have been found in Mexico.

00:21.638 --> 00:22.937
Questions remain.

00:22.939 --> 00:24.705
Were they victims or perpetrators?

00:26.142 --> 00:27.575
Let's assume what Ryan told us is true.

00:27.577 --> 00:29.176
He's sprayed with a chemical agent,

00:29.178 --> 00:31.612
loses consciousness, wakes up
in the middle of a desert,

00:31.614 --> 00:32.780
is thrown in a Mexican jail

00:32.782 --> 00:34.315
because drugs were planted on him,

00:34.317 --> 00:37.451
is rescued only to find one
of his best friends is dead.

00:37.453 --> 00:39.153
It was brutal. So hot.

00:39.155 --> 00:40.655
Our throats were just burning.

00:40.657 --> 00:43.290
Maybe Dr. Garza found out
his wife was having an affair

00:43.292 --> 00:45.793
with Father Casanova and blamed his son.

00:45.795 --> 00:48.529
It says here oxycodone
was in Lucas' blood?

00:48.531 --> 00:49.797
- They had oxy?
- I'm coming to tell you

00:49.799 --> 00:51.832
that you've got another crime scene.

00:51.834 --> 00:55.436
As a solution to a murder,
it doesn't get any worse

00:55.438 --> 00:58.339
than this.

01:10.253 --> 01:12.520
Okay, Kendall. What do you see?

01:12.522 --> 01:15.156
Physical symptoms indicate
a narcotics overdose.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.892
No needle marks,
so I'm guessing the drugs

01:17.894 --> 01:19.026
were taken by mouth.

01:19.028 --> 01:22.963
Oh. And here's an open bottle of tequila.

01:22.965 --> 01:26.133
Tequila and oxy. That's a bad combo.

01:26.135 --> 01:28.436
He could have fallen when
he passed out and hit his head.

01:28.438 --> 01:30.204
This might not have been an accident.

01:30.206 --> 01:33.374
When I pushed the spacebar,
the screen saver disappeared

01:33.376 --> 01:35.876
and left an open Word document.

01:35.878 --> 01:40.114
It says, "Dear Sara, I didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

01:40.116 --> 01:42.717
Lucas and his friends
started using my oxy,

01:42.719 --> 01:44.919
then stole most of it for themselves.

01:44.921 --> 01:48.155
In trying to get it back,
I lost control of my actions."

01:48.157 --> 01:50.257
"If I'd been able to kick my addiction,

01:50.259 --> 01:51.892
we'd still be a happy family.

01:51.894 --> 01:54.962
You were right. I was
a terrible father and husband.

01:55.711 --> 01:59.033
I'm so sorry for the pain
and suffering I caused everyone.

01:59.394 --> 02:00.501
Mateo."

02:00.896 --> 02:03.604
That's a confession with a motive.

02:03.606 --> 02:06.774
But we have several
outstanding questions.

02:06.776 --> 02:09.143
Follow up. Of course.
But this suicide note clears

02:09.145 --> 02:11.479
the boys, the Catholic Church,
and takes the...

02:11.481 --> 02:12.813
I don't even know what to call it...

02:12.815 --> 02:14.749
the "forced deportation"
issue off the table.

02:14.751 --> 02:18.018
We're trying to figure
out a murder/kidnapping here,

02:18.020 --> 02:21.555
not solve a bunch of political problems.

02:21.557 --> 02:23.557
Okay. Fine. Let's review.

02:23.559 --> 02:25.559
How did Sara Garza take the notification

02:25.561 --> 02:26.694
of her husband's death?

02:26.696 --> 02:28.729
I believe the word is "stoic."

02:28.731 --> 02:30.564
No one but the Garzas were told

02:30.566 --> 02:33.033
Lucas' blood tested positive for oxy.

02:33.035 --> 02:34.468
And whoever wrote that note

02:34.470 --> 02:36.070
knew that oxy was in his bloodstream.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.639
Yeah, but let's talk about
what the note doesn't explain.

02:38.641 --> 02:40.441
- Amy?
- If the boys took the oxy,

02:40.443 --> 02:42.076
why didn't Lucas
have some in his backpack?

02:42.078 --> 02:43.244
Ryan and Miguel did.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.812
There wouldn't be a record of Dr. Garza

02:44.814 --> 02:46.680
going into Mexico to leave the boys,

02:46.682 --> 02:48.082
but we'd have one of him coming back...

02:48.084 --> 02:51.051
Look, this suicide note,
it's completely fake, okay?

02:51.053 --> 02:54.421
You kill your child and dump
his body at a church for drugs?

02:54.423 --> 02:56.157
- Julio.
- Sir, you're telling me

02:56.159 --> 02:58.225
Doctor Garza had no other way
of getting more oxy

02:58.227 --> 02:59.860
than to kill his own son?

02:59.862 --> 03:00.895
Okay, Julio.

03:00.897 --> 03:03.166
It's not a suicide. It's a murder.

03:04.467 --> 03:06.078
I'm sitting down, ma'am.

03:09.672 --> 03:12.807
No matter how it happened,
Garza died at work.

03:12.809 --> 03:14.875
We should get a list of everyone
at his office today.

03:14.877 --> 03:18.879
And look for names that overlap
with any part of this case.

03:18.881 --> 03:21.682
I thought the federal government
kept us from patient records.

03:21.684 --> 03:23.717
We're just looking to see
who was in the building,

03:23.719 --> 03:25.186
not at their medical history.

03:25.188 --> 03:27.388
It may have made more sense when
Dr. Garza was a suspect.

03:27.390 --> 03:29.790
But if I could work
his office's patient list, too,

03:29.792 --> 03:32.493
it might help me determine
where Lucas meant to go

03:32.495 --> 03:34.028
when he and his friends
left the field trip.

03:34.030 --> 03:35.996
That would be a small miracle.

03:35.998 --> 03:37.798
Are you assuming the deaths of Dr. Garza

03:37.800 --> 03:39.033
and his son were connected?

03:39.035 --> 03:41.702
Well, it's not a random coincidence.

03:41.704 --> 03:43.404
Then could we release Miguel and Ryan

03:43.406 --> 03:45.906
since they were in police
custody when the doctor died?

03:45.908 --> 03:48.008
Well, first, they need
to answer a few questions.

03:48.010 --> 03:50.544
Not while they're under arrest
and have counsel.

03:50.546 --> 03:52.746
Excuse me. But can't we just
tell Miguel and Ryan's attorneys

03:52.748 --> 03:54.315
we're dropping the charges against them

03:54.317 --> 03:56.350
and question the boys
again while we're waiting

03:56.352 --> 03:57.685
for the parents to pick them up?

03:57.687 --> 03:59.887
Buzz! That's so sneaky!

03:59.889 --> 04:02.756
No, I'm, uh... In my reserve
detective class...

04:02.758 --> 04:05.426
That is exactly what we will do.

04:05.428 --> 04:06.961
We can re-arrest the boys later.

04:06.963 --> 04:10.764
Julio, see if you can get both
boys over here separately.

04:10.766 --> 04:13.033
No more merit badges for you, Buzz.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.936
Well, dropping the charges against Ryan

04:15.938 --> 04:18.339
will not get that kid to talk to us.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.940
It's okay, Lieutenant.

04:20.410 --> 04:24.039
We won't be asking the questions.

04:24.780 --> 04:27.681
I know that you've waited
a long time to talk to Ryan.

04:27.683 --> 04:30.117
And we felt he could
use a spiritual boost

04:30.119 --> 04:32.255
after all he's been through.

04:33.689 --> 04:36.924
Thank you, Lieutenant.
I really appreciate this.

04:36.926 --> 04:40.127
And I assume this means
Miguel can go free, too.

04:40.129 --> 04:43.597
His parents are on the way
to pick Miguel up right now.

04:43.599 --> 04:46.734
So, here, take as long as you would like.

04:46.736 --> 04:48.736
Thank you.

04:49.672 --> 04:52.651
Father. Thank you for coming. Thank you.

04:53.242 --> 04:54.775
Thank you.

04:54.777 --> 04:56.110
It's almost over.

04:56.112 --> 04:58.115
We'll let you know when your mom is here.

04:59.115 --> 05:01.382
Can you guys legally do this?

05:01.384 --> 05:03.817
Listen to a private conversation between

05:03.819 --> 05:05.052
a priest and a parishioner?

05:05.054 --> 05:06.553
My assistant is right.

05:06.555 --> 05:08.722
We are in tricky waters, Commander.

05:08.724 --> 05:11.425
The second Ryan says "bless me,
Father, for I have sinned,"

05:11.427 --> 05:14.128
this recording stops.
Hand on the mute button, Buzz.

05:14.130 --> 05:17.134
Take a breath.
You can tell me everything.

05:18.301 --> 05:19.636
Father.

05:20.069 --> 05:22.102
Father, I have to tell the cops
what happened.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.470
I have to.

05:23.472 --> 05:25.673
You don't need to say another
word to them, Ryan.

05:25.675 --> 05:27.441
They're dropping all charges.

05:27.443 --> 05:28.463
They're releasing you.

05:28.465 --> 05:30.244
But the police have to know
what happened to Hector.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.313
It's the reason we were kidnapped.

05:32.315 --> 05:33.775
It's the reason...

05:35.518 --> 05:37.320
Lucas is gone.

05:38.287 --> 05:39.386
Look, it's my fault.

05:39.388 --> 05:44.024
Ryan, listen.
You've been absolved for Hector.

05:44.026 --> 05:45.526
And it's not police business.

05:45.528 --> 05:46.927
It is!

05:46.929 --> 05:49.196
Everything that happened,
the cartel did this to us!

05:49.198 --> 05:51.065
They figured out I killed Hector.

05:51.067 --> 05:52.733
Now Lucas is dead,
and Miguel could be next.

05:52.735 --> 05:54.535
And I have to tell them. I have
to do something about it.

05:54.537 --> 05:57.204
Oh, my God. He just confessed
to the wrong murder.

05:57.206 --> 05:59.540
No, no, no. Hold on. Hold on.

05:59.542 --> 06:02.343
Just wait a second. Okay?

06:02.345 --> 06:03.722
Now, what happened...

06:04.780 --> 06:08.382
Hector's death was ruled an accident.

06:08.384 --> 06:11.018
And nobody knows what happened
to him except you and me.

06:11.020 --> 06:13.253
The cartel has to know.

06:13.255 --> 06:16.991
Somehow. I mean, it's the only
thing that makes sense.

06:16.993 --> 06:20.627
Look. I can't... I can't
let them kill Miguel, too.

06:20.629 --> 06:22.629
I have to save him.

06:22.631 --> 06:24.398
I have to.

06:24.400 --> 06:28.330
Ryan, did you tell anyone else
but me what happened to Hector?

06:31.073 --> 06:32.072
Did you?

06:32.074 --> 06:35.542
I know... I know you said not to.

06:35.544 --> 06:38.779
But when we woke up and we
found out we were in Mexico,

06:38.781 --> 06:40.314
I was just so scared.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.483
I tried to get Miguel
to go on without me.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.884
I tried.

06:43.886 --> 06:45.986
I mean, it's me they're after. Not him.

06:45.988 --> 06:49.523
I can't book Ryan for the murder
of his stepfather based on

06:49.525 --> 06:51.058
what he's saying to a priest.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.826
- You won't have to.
- If they killed him, too...

06:52.828 --> 06:56.430
Ryan, now, this is very important.

06:56.432 --> 07:00.801
I want you to tell me exactly
what you told Miguel.

07:01.238 --> 07:02.989
Word for word.

07:03.739 --> 07:06.640
Go on without me. Let's split up.

07:06.642 --> 07:08.537
Go different ways.

07:09.645 --> 07:11.111
Why did he want to do that?

07:11.113 --> 07:13.781
I don't know. We were freaked out.

07:13.783 --> 07:16.670
It was hot. We weren't feeling good.

07:17.319 --> 07:18.519
What?

07:18.521 --> 07:20.120
That's the whole story?

07:20.122 --> 07:22.956
Ryan told you nothing else? You're sure?

07:22.958 --> 07:25.893
Well, at first, it hurt to talk.

07:25.895 --> 07:29.329
Our throats were so messed up.
And then we were arrested by...

07:29.331 --> 07:31.065
The authorities in Rosarito for drugs.

07:31.067 --> 07:35.469
Yeah. Okay. Thank you for all
your honesty and cooperation.

07:35.471 --> 07:38.839
So, you're still gonna drop
the murder charges against me?

07:38.841 --> 07:40.674
Uh, yeah.

07:40.676 --> 07:43.710
Yes, and then we're
extraditing you back to Mexico,

07:43.712 --> 07:45.646
where you will be charged
with opiate possession with...

07:45.648 --> 07:47.981
No, no, no, no. You can't do
that. No, you can't do that!

07:47.983 --> 07:50.250
Oh, tell me what
we can't do one more time,

07:50.252 --> 07:52.186
and you'll be saying it
in the back seat of my car

07:52.188 --> 07:54.455
as I drive you to the Mexican border!

07:54.457 --> 07:56.924
So much for not threatening
the undocumented.

07:56.926 --> 07:58.225
We don't protect criminals.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.461
We have a right to know his culpability.

08:00.463 --> 08:02.362
And now, instead of helping us,

08:02.364 --> 08:05.165
you sit here lying your ass off!

08:05.167 --> 08:07.067
We'll let the Mexican
authorities have a shot

08:07.069 --> 08:09.136
at this little drug-dealing operation.

08:09.138 --> 08:11.305
Those weren't my drugs.
I've never taken drugs.

08:11.307 --> 08:14.141
And while you're leaving
to spend the rest of your life

08:14.143 --> 08:17.911
behind bars in Margaritaville,
ICE will pop over

08:17.913 --> 08:19.379
to your parents' house

08:19.381 --> 08:21.949
and give them a lift
back across the border.

08:21.951 --> 08:23.283
Please. Please.

08:23.285 --> 08:25.819
Let me explain this, okay?
Here's the choice.

08:25.821 --> 08:28.188
You can lie and save your best friend.

08:28.190 --> 08:31.258
Or you can tell the truth
and save your family.

08:32.037 --> 08:35.582
Your family. You understand?

08:38.543 --> 08:41.068
Okay. Look. I don't know
if what Ryan told me was true,

08:41.070 --> 08:42.703
because it didn't make sense,

08:42.705 --> 08:44.256
but he told me...

08:45.941 --> 08:50.055
He told you... what?

08:50.679 --> 08:53.413
That...

08:53.415 --> 08:57.151
That we'd been kidnapped because
he killed his stepfather.

08:57.153 --> 08:59.286
That he had tried to keep
the police from finding

08:59.288 --> 09:01.655
Hector's cartel connections,
that he'd even waited

09:01.657 --> 09:04.324
for the moment when the jerk
wasn't wearing his stupid-ass,

09:04.326 --> 09:06.026
"Hey, look, I'm a criminal" bracelet

09:06.028 --> 09:07.572
just to push him...

09:08.698 --> 09:10.797
just to push him over that balcony.

09:10.799 --> 09:12.966
That the cartel must have
figured out what he had done,

09:12.968 --> 09:14.801
but it's not true.

09:15.330 --> 09:17.457
What? What's not true?

09:18.625 --> 09:20.474
The cartel wouldn't
have dumped us in Mexico.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.409
They would have shot us
when we got in the limo.

09:22.411 --> 09:25.145
So it had nothing to do with Ryan or me.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.509
It had to be about Lucas.

09:28.918 --> 09:31.485
Why did it have to be about Lucas?

09:31.487 --> 09:33.820
Because he's dead and... and we're not.

09:33.822 --> 09:35.240
But why did he die?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.390
I don't know, okay?

09:36.392 --> 09:37.991
How the hell am I supposed
to know, all right?

09:37.993 --> 09:39.826
You guys, you just
sit there and you think,

09:39.828 --> 09:42.396
"Wow, they're only 15. What do
they have to worry about?"

09:42.398 --> 09:44.464
I walk past a man every day
on my way to school

09:44.466 --> 09:46.533
who shouts things at me like, "wetback"

09:46.535 --> 09:47.901
or "go back to Mexico,"

09:47.903 --> 09:50.304
never sure if my family is gonna
be there when I get back.

09:50.306 --> 09:52.239
And Ryan... his stepfather
was beating him.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.208
Because he was different, different.

09:54.210 --> 09:55.475
He was beating him!

09:55.477 --> 09:57.444
And what did you people do to help?

09:57.446 --> 09:59.546
And Lucas's father was an
addict, in and out of rehab...

09:59.548 --> 10:01.515
and his mother was
probably having an affair,

10:01.517 --> 10:03.550
and his whole family
was about to blow apart.

10:03.552 --> 10:05.419
- An affair?
- And who do we know

10:05.421 --> 10:08.689
who likes to have affairs with
the mothers of troubled kids?

10:08.691 --> 10:12.492
It's okay. Sit down. Sit down. Relax.

10:12.494 --> 10:15.562
Now, tell me. Lucas thought his mother

10:15.564 --> 10:17.392
might be having an affair.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.000
With whom?

10:20.002 --> 10:22.603
He didn't know. All she did...

10:22.605 --> 10:25.339
She told Lucas she couldn't
handle his father's

10:25.341 --> 10:28.508
drugging anymore, and that she
might leave him for someone

10:28.510 --> 10:29.977
who she knew loved them.

10:29.979 --> 10:31.511
But she changed her mind.

10:31.513 --> 10:33.180
- So...
- That's all he ever said about it.

10:33.182 --> 10:35.582
...this isn't all just about Lucas.

10:35.584 --> 10:37.184
Buzz, call Dr. Morales.

10:37.186 --> 10:40.487
Tell him I would like
to look at Mateo Garza's body.

10:40.489 --> 10:45.892
I think that this case
just broke wide open.

10:50.149 --> 10:52.611
It's day 13, and the mystery behind

10:52.636 --> 10:55.225
the St. Joseph's Three deepens
as authorities struggle

10:55.250 --> 10:56.649
to explain the suicide

10:56.651 --> 10:59.087
of Dr. Mateo Garza, father of...

10:59.089 --> 11:00.953
...not only refusing to return
the million dollars

11:00.955 --> 11:03.156
taken from the Diaz family,
but also refusing

11:03.158 --> 11:05.658
to release their son
from police custody, despite...

11:05.660 --> 11:07.760
Ryan Rojas, who only 11 days ago

11:07.762 --> 11:08.928
was considered missing,

11:08.930 --> 11:10.863
continues to be under arrest

11:10.865 --> 11:12.799
while police have gone mum

11:12.801 --> 11:15.134
about the young boy's cartel connections.

11:15.136 --> 11:18.037
So far, the FBI has
refused to drop charges

11:18.039 --> 11:20.306
against Marvin Garret
for what they claim was

11:20.308 --> 11:22.875
illegal possession of flash suppressors,

11:22.877 --> 11:25.678
while an entire family
of undocumented immigrants,

11:25.680 --> 11:30.216
whose son was arrested for the
murder of an American citizen,

11:30.218 --> 11:31.717
- remain free and in their home.
- Hey.

11:31.719 --> 11:33.386
Your brother and sister are here.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.755
- Ricky.
- Andy.

11:35.757 --> 11:37.590
- Damn it.
- Emily.

11:37.592 --> 11:39.091
When is Mom coming back?

11:39.093 --> 11:40.560
- You guys are here early.
- Excuse me.

11:40.562 --> 11:42.328
- Hey.
- And I finally get

11:42.330 --> 11:45.832
- to congratulate you in person.
- Oh, thank you.

11:45.834 --> 11:48.534
This marriage is the biggest
honor of my life.

11:48.536 --> 11:50.679
- Hey, guys.
- Rusty!

11:50.681 --> 11:53.206
Hey. Uh, Mom is at the morgue

11:53.208 --> 11:54.941
with Lieutenant Tao
and Lieutenant Provenza.

11:54.943 --> 11:58.211
They're trying to close out
this St. Joseph's Three case

11:58.213 --> 11:59.946
that's been all over the news.

11:59.948 --> 12:02.715
Yeah, so you guys might have to
grab some dinner without us.

12:02.717 --> 12:04.951
Oh, my. Uh, we still are having

12:04.953 --> 12:06.953
a wedding rehearsal tomorrow night, yes?

12:06.955 --> 12:08.788
Yeah, well, that's...

12:08.790 --> 12:11.023
That's kind of up in the air
a little, too.

12:11.025 --> 12:13.125
Um, we might have to work the vows

12:13.127 --> 12:14.961
around the investigation somehow.

12:14.963 --> 12:17.763
I thought... Didn't the doctor tell Mom

12:17.765 --> 12:19.665
that she should cut back?

12:19.667 --> 12:21.200
Well, only when she's tired.

12:21.202 --> 12:23.936
And the medication he gave her
is working very well.

12:23.938 --> 12:26.072
Well, you know,
she's lived a very good life,

12:26.074 --> 12:28.140
and it's not like she has
a lot of bad habits

12:28.142 --> 12:29.308
she has to kick.

12:29.310 --> 12:31.811
Right now, everyone's out
serving this massive

12:31.813 --> 12:33.346
search warrant at a doctor's office.

12:33.348 --> 12:35.248
And it's just possible
that they'll find the name

12:35.250 --> 12:37.016
they're looking for, and we'll be able

12:37.018 --> 12:38.718
to stick to the schedule.

12:38.720 --> 12:40.653
If the Catholic Church
is still up to perform

12:40.655 --> 12:42.088
the wedding after the arrest.

12:42.090 --> 12:45.157
Well. Maybe we should have
dinner in tonight.

12:45.159 --> 12:46.459
Sure. Yeah.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.628
Hey, while we're here, use us
to ease up on Mom's stress.

12:48.630 --> 12:50.329
Anyway we can.

12:50.753 --> 12:52.865
Besides the suicide, I have two injuries.

12:52.867 --> 12:54.667
First, you can see a cracked sternum

12:54.669 --> 12:55.968
in the center of the chest.

12:55.970 --> 12:57.803
Dr. Redmond said he performed CPR

12:57.805 --> 12:59.272
when he found him in the office.

12:59.274 --> 13:01.674
Ah. It looked like someone
tried hard to revive him.

13:01.676 --> 13:05.044
And the other injury is a skull fracture

13:05.046 --> 13:06.445
just beneath the hairline.

13:06.447 --> 13:09.916
You can see it on the X-rays.

13:09.918 --> 13:12.351
Could the doctor have done that falling?

13:12.353 --> 13:13.920
After he passed out?

13:13.922 --> 13:16.489
If he bounced off a hard object
on his way to the ground.

13:16.491 --> 13:19.525
Could a person have slammed
his head into something?

13:20.033 --> 13:21.534
Well...

13:25.700 --> 13:28.401
Hmm. There's a fair amount of irritation

13:28.403 --> 13:29.702
to the back of his scalp.

13:29.704 --> 13:31.237
His hair has been
pulled out by the roots.

13:31.239 --> 13:34.473
During violent overdoses, people
often do that to themselves.

13:34.475 --> 13:36.208
An alternative theory...

13:36.210 --> 13:38.411
Dr. Garza could have been
knocked unconscious by someone

13:38.413 --> 13:41.614
and force-fed enough drugs
to cause an overdose?

13:41.616 --> 13:45.251
It could be. It's probably what
the killer did to the boys.

13:45.253 --> 13:48.087
Have you examined the back
of Dr. Garza's throat?

13:48.089 --> 13:49.555
Of course. In overdose cases,

13:49.557 --> 13:54.193
I always look for signs
of vomiting or asphyxiation.

13:54.195 --> 13:55.494
Inflammation?

13:55.496 --> 13:58.264
Similar to what you found in
Lucas Garza's throat?

13:58.266 --> 13:59.799
Oh, well.

13:59.801 --> 14:01.767
Yes.

14:01.769 --> 14:04.003
In both cases, the inflammation

14:04.005 --> 14:06.238
could have been caused
by involuntary retching.

14:06.240 --> 14:13.946
Though, now that you mention it,
these marks are a lot alike.

14:13.948 --> 14:15.848
Well, we've got a problem.

14:16.297 --> 14:19.785
FBI agents Vega and Fey are back,

14:19.787 --> 14:22.421
ready to deport the Diaz family.

14:22.423 --> 14:24.690
They really want to keep
that million dollars.

14:24.692 --> 14:26.158
You better believe it.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.794
I can't wait to hear the lame-ass excuse

14:28.796 --> 14:30.529
these two come up with.

14:30.531 --> 14:34.100
I don't normally say this
to local law enforcement,

14:34.102 --> 14:37.003
but on behalf of the FBI, I apologize.

14:37.005 --> 14:39.038
With this amount of money,
and the implications

14:39.040 --> 14:40.439
both here and across the border,

14:40.441 --> 14:43.042
we saw this as a for-ransom kidnapping.

14:43.044 --> 14:45.778
We've read the suicide note
written by Dr. Garza.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.980
And while technically,
the kids were abducted,

14:47.982 --> 14:51.250
the million dollars was not part of that.

14:53.793 --> 14:55.211
And?

14:56.357 --> 14:59.392
Again, we were wrong.

14:59.394 --> 15:00.659
And we apologize.

15:00.661 --> 15:03.396
Well, now I have heard everything.

15:03.398 --> 15:04.797
Agents Vega and Fey,

15:04.799 --> 15:07.433
I appreciate your apology very much.

15:07.435 --> 15:09.502
Well, how about a big
"I'm sorry," for withholding

15:09.504 --> 15:12.004
information that the boys
had been found in Mexico?

15:12.006 --> 15:13.439
For that, you'd have to go to our boss.

15:13.441 --> 15:16.275
Okay, moving on.
Since Dr. Garza confessed,

15:16.277 --> 15:18.144
and your investigation has concluded,

15:18.146 --> 15:22.081
the FBI would like to transfer
the Diaz family to ICE.

15:22.083 --> 15:24.316
Our investigation isn't over.

15:24.318 --> 15:27.253
And no matter the outcome, Miguel Diaz is

15:27.255 --> 15:29.789
a material witness
and will be required to remain.

15:29.791 --> 15:31.390
Wait, what?

15:31.392 --> 15:33.893
How could he be a material
witness if there is no trial?

15:33.895 --> 15:35.294
I-I don't understand.

15:35.296 --> 15:38.431
Well, that's because
you don't listen, Vega.

15:38.433 --> 15:40.366
Commander, if I may.

15:40.368 --> 15:41.867
Uh, I will say it again.

15:41.869 --> 15:44.970
The LAPD has not closed this case.

15:44.972 --> 15:46.939
Are you operating, then,
on the supposition

15:46.941 --> 15:48.074
that Dr. Garza's note...

15:48.076 --> 15:50.009
Was not written by Garza.

15:50.011 --> 15:51.544
His death was not a suicide.

15:51.546 --> 15:53.279
And he did not kill his son.

15:53.281 --> 15:55.714
And this conclusion is based on...

15:55.716 --> 15:57.116
Evidence of an altercation.

15:57.118 --> 15:59.150
- Evidence?
- Mm.

15:59.587 --> 16:00.820
I want to see it.

16:00.822 --> 16:02.488
Our joint task force

16:02.490 --> 16:03.656
has concluded.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.157
You're letting
personal politics get in the way

16:05.159 --> 16:07.493
of a Federal Order of Deportation.

16:07.495 --> 16:10.763
Miguel is a material witness
in a murder investigation.

16:10.765 --> 16:13.365
And you have to give his family
back their million dollars.

16:13.367 --> 16:14.700
Get used to it.

16:14.702 --> 16:17.103
The Diaz family is living in
this country illegally.

16:17.105 --> 16:19.004
But while Miguel's testimony
remains necessary

16:19.006 --> 16:20.773
to a murder conviction, they stay.

16:20.775 --> 16:22.208
All right, all right.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.909
Look, this is big deal,
the Diazs being here.

16:23.911 --> 16:25.277
It's on the news.

16:25.279 --> 16:27.279
And it's a flagrant
violation of U.S. law.

16:27.281 --> 16:29.014
We have no choice but to address it.

16:29.016 --> 16:31.917
So, if there's some way
we can help expedite

16:31.919 --> 16:34.854
your investigation so Miguel's
testimony is not necessary...

16:34.856 --> 16:37.756
We need records from ICE of every person

16:37.758 --> 16:41.460
who came back over the border
and into the United States

16:41.462 --> 16:42.728
in the last two weeks.

16:42.730 --> 16:46.932
Topping that very long list,
you will note Dr. Garza.

16:46.934 --> 16:49.001
If we can prove Garza went to Mexico

16:49.003 --> 16:51.103
and came back after the boys' abduction,

16:51.105 --> 16:52.771
we might rethink this deportation order.

16:52.773 --> 16:56.575
We'd also like to include
Marvin Garret to that list.

16:56.577 --> 17:00.012
Yes, and all of his unhyphenated friends.

17:00.014 --> 17:02.148
We'd like to see if any of them
crossed the border

17:02.150 --> 17:03.782
during this time frame.

17:03.784 --> 17:06.785
This is a lot of work when we've
already identified the killer.

17:06.787 --> 17:08.420
We have not identified the killer.

17:08.422 --> 17:09.961
Pay attention.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.180
Okay.

17:12.126 --> 17:14.425
Just remember, we're not here to enforce

17:14.428 --> 17:17.963
our own personal beliefs,
but to do our duty.

17:17.964 --> 17:19.932
And, as you said, Chief,

17:19.934 --> 17:22.968
there is no such thing
as a sanctuary city.

17:35.750 --> 17:37.583
The FBI isn't wrong.

17:37.585 --> 17:39.385
The U.S. Government not only has a right,

17:39.387 --> 17:42.421
but also a responsibility
to protect its borders.

17:42.423 --> 17:44.757
Well, that's exactly
what we're counting on, Chief,

17:44.759 --> 17:46.757
to prove our case.

17:52.853 --> 17:54.252
I don't feel good about this, Mom.

17:54.254 --> 17:55.887
I mean, we intended
to make dinner for you.

17:55.889 --> 17:58.426
- The whole idea was...
- She's taking her meds.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.818
She feels a lot better.

17:59.820 --> 18:01.520
Grab a chair. The adults have this.

18:01.522 --> 18:03.189
- We really do.
- Fine, fine.

18:03.191 --> 18:06.492
Just, from now on, please, we do
not want you taking care of us.

18:06.494 --> 18:07.893
We want to take care of you.

18:07.895 --> 18:11.830
But if I can't do the things
that make life

18:11.832 --> 18:14.133
worth living, why be here at all?

18:14.135 --> 18:15.167
Now, come on.

18:15.169 --> 18:18.604
Let's try and talk about normal things.

18:18.606 --> 18:23.108
All right. Well. What sort of
normal things did you do today?

18:23.110 --> 18:24.677
I... I went to the morgue.

18:24.679 --> 18:26.979
- Oh.
- And I made up with the FBI.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.781
And I solved a murder
I wasn't investigating.

18:28.783 --> 18:29.949
What else?

18:29.951 --> 18:32.685
Just the usual things, really.

18:32.687 --> 18:34.954
And you're sure this murder/kidnapping

18:34.956 --> 18:36.956
isn't gonna delay the ceremony?

18:36.958 --> 18:38.991
I hope not. I just dropped off checks

18:38.993 --> 18:40.593
at the florist and the caterer.

18:40.595 --> 18:43.162
And no matter what happens,
Friday night, we are having

18:43.164 --> 18:45.297
a rehearsal dinner,
and then Saturday at 2:00 P.M.,

18:45.299 --> 18:47.633
assuming you guys haven't
all been ex-communicated...

18:47.635 --> 18:49.635
...you are walking down the aisle

18:49.637 --> 18:51.136
at St. Joseph's of Nazareth.

18:51.138 --> 18:52.805
And you're all coming with me.

18:52.807 --> 18:57.076
Don't worry. Now that we know
that it was this Ms. Garza

18:57.078 --> 18:59.778
who was having an affair,
we're almost done.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.447
- Seriously?
- Yes. I've got two doctors

19:01.449 --> 19:04.283
coming in tomorrow to check
the throats of Miguel and Ryan.

19:04.285 --> 19:06.619
If they find what
I think they will find...

19:06.621 --> 19:08.287
- Two doctors?
- Yes. Well, I can't

19:08.289 --> 19:11.190
make an arrest based on
a physical exam without

19:11.192 --> 19:12.791
a second opinion.

19:12.793 --> 19:14.526
Don't you think, Andy?

19:14.528 --> 19:15.961
Uh, well, yeah.

19:15.963 --> 19:18.434
I mean, because we're so close
to the finish line.

19:19.001 --> 19:22.270
Just a couple of questions to answer.

19:23.938 --> 19:25.940
What kind of questions?

19:28.276 --> 19:29.541
You have the right to remain silent.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.844
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

19:31.846 --> 19:33.112
You have the right to an attorney.

19:33.114 --> 19:34.513
If you cannot afford one,

19:34.515 --> 19:36.248
one will be appointed
for you by the state.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.850
My son goes missing.

19:38.202 --> 19:40.319
You find him dead,

19:40.321 --> 19:42.588
his body dumped at our church.

19:42.590 --> 19:43.856
My husband commits suicide.

19:43.858 --> 19:45.824
And you're reading me my rights?

19:45.826 --> 19:47.259
Are you actual detectives?

19:47.261 --> 19:49.395
Or are you just here
to make people miserable?

19:49.397 --> 19:51.230
How is it that you're questioning me

19:51.232 --> 19:54.066
when everything that's happened
so far is your fault?

19:54.068 --> 19:56.001
We'll see about that.

19:56.003 --> 19:58.704
The day-before-yesterday, you left here,

19:58.706 --> 20:00.873
and your husband left
right after you did.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.741
So what happened next?

20:02.743 --> 20:05.010
We had an argument at our car.

20:05.012 --> 20:06.512
What was the argument about?

20:06.514 --> 20:08.347
Lucas was found with oxycodone
in his bloodstream.

20:08.349 --> 20:09.982
Where do you think that came from?

20:09.984 --> 20:11.984
How do you suppose that Ryan and Miguel

20:11.986 --> 20:13.752
were found with oxycodone
in their backpacks?

20:13.754 --> 20:14.983
Mateo!

20:16.424 --> 20:17.742
Ma...

20:20.394 --> 20:22.621
Mateo was...

20:25.166 --> 20:28.567
He should have overdosed
months ago. And then...

20:28.569 --> 20:32.838
So after the argument,
any idea where Dr. Garza went?

20:32.840 --> 20:34.606
We went back to the office.

20:34.608 --> 20:37.076
Um, Mateo wasn't
going to perform any surgeries

20:37.078 --> 20:42.681
until after Lucas' funeral.

20:42.683 --> 20:45.561
But I... I couldn't stay. I...

20:46.087 --> 20:47.453
I had to leave.

20:47.455 --> 20:51.192
You were at the office
before your husband died?

20:51.692 --> 20:52.958
Of suicide.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.293
Which is what you said.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.962
He killed himself after I left.

20:56.964 --> 20:59.031
We also said your son
died from natural causes.

20:59.033 --> 21:00.866
But we're revising
that opinion that, too.

21:00.868 --> 21:01.900
What?

21:01.902 --> 21:04.169
- Why?
- Okay, Mike.

21:04.171 --> 21:05.804
I think we're going to have
to push a little harder.

21:05.806 --> 21:09.041
I really haven't slept much
over the past two weeks.

21:09.043 --> 21:11.343
I'm... I'm tired, and, personally,

21:11.345 --> 21:13.645
I just want to put this case behind us.

21:13.647 --> 21:17.249
So, in the interest of time,
I am going to bluntly ask you

21:17.251 --> 21:19.718
to tell us about the affair
you were having

21:19.720 --> 21:21.553
while your husband was in rehab

21:21.555 --> 21:24.957
and the name of the person
that you've been sleeping with.

21:24.959 --> 21:26.692
How... How dare you?

21:26.694 --> 21:28.694
You're gonna accuse me now
of having an affair?

21:28.696 --> 21:31.196
Your child goes missing,
and you tell people everything

21:31.198 --> 21:32.364
you know to get him back.

21:32.366 --> 21:33.599
Everything. You don't lie.

21:33.601 --> 21:35.000
She's not denying it.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.969
My son is dead.

21:36.971 --> 21:39.407
My husband is dead.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.974
I will not be insulted this way.

21:41.976 --> 21:43.475
Pardon the interruption.

21:43.477 --> 21:46.745
We often come to a moment
like this when a suspect

21:46.747 --> 21:48.747
doth protest too much.

21:48.749 --> 21:52.670
A suspect? I'm a suspect now?
What am I a suspect in?

21:53.287 --> 21:56.255
These marked charges on your
business credit-card statements

21:56.257 --> 21:58.724
are all from hotels in L.A. County.

21:58.726 --> 22:00.025
Where you live.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.094
Even more interesting,
we reviewed records

22:02.096 --> 22:03.862
from these hotels, and the check-in

22:03.864 --> 22:04.963
and the check-out times were never

22:04.965 --> 22:06.532
more than three hours apart.

22:06.534 --> 22:09.768
Usually between 3:00 and 6:00 P.M.

22:09.770 --> 22:13.872
Now, this is a pattern that has
gone on for close to six months,

22:13.874 --> 22:15.774
ending abruptly right before

22:15.776 --> 22:17.342
your husband returned

22:17.344 --> 22:19.678
from his last stint in rehab.

22:19.680 --> 22:23.015
Which, indicates to us, maybe half-a-year

22:23.017 --> 22:25.536
of afternoon delights?

22:26.887 --> 22:30.589
So, are you the marriage police now?

22:30.591 --> 22:33.992
I'm a suspect in what? Adultery?

22:33.994 --> 22:35.794
How is this any of your concern?

22:35.796 --> 22:37.715
Were you having an affair?

22:41.302 --> 22:44.036
Oh, Ms. Garza, we need to know
whom you were you sleeping with.

22:44.038 --> 22:45.304
It wasn't like that.

22:45.306 --> 22:47.673
I don't care what it was like.

22:47.675 --> 22:49.141
I want to know who.

22:49.143 --> 22:51.643
You know, you've been against me
from the very beginning.

22:51.645 --> 22:54.023
All of you go to hell!

22:58.719 --> 23:02.187
I would call that
confirmation of the affair.

23:02.189 --> 23:04.223
So would I. Wes?

23:04.225 --> 23:05.591
S.I.S. is set up to follow her.

23:05.593 --> 23:07.326
Excuse me, Commander.
The FBI came up with

23:07.328 --> 23:09.962
an interesting name
off the Garza patient list.

23:09.964 --> 23:12.397
Someone who came back
from Mexico a few hours

23:12.399 --> 23:14.233
before Lucas' body
was dumped in the church.

23:14.235 --> 23:15.767
I'm going to run over and check it out.

23:15.769 --> 23:17.102
Get video if they have it.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.172
Yes, ma'am.

23:21.709 --> 23:25.310
Now comes the hard part.

23:25.312 --> 23:27.279
I want you to
know, if I'd had any information

23:27.281 --> 23:28.580
that would've helped
you find the boys sooner,

23:28.582 --> 23:30.082
I would have shared it in a heartbeat.

23:30.084 --> 23:32.718
I understand. If you just answer

23:32.720 --> 23:36.565
a few questions for us,
and we will be done.

23:47.201 --> 23:48.667
This way, Father.

23:48.669 --> 23:51.036
Sharon? A moment?

23:51.038 --> 23:54.239
Um, your children told me
you had a health scare

23:54.241 --> 23:55.653
over the weekend.

23:56.710 --> 23:58.210
I'm fine now, Father.

23:58.212 --> 24:01.046
If you'd like to observe
the interview in electronics,

24:01.048 --> 24:02.447
come this way.

24:02.449 --> 24:04.176
Uh, Sharon.

24:04.752 --> 24:07.319
We've both been trying...
very hard... to balance

24:07.321 --> 24:10.641
the needs of our separate
vocations with, um...

24:11.325 --> 24:17.462
With what I think of as a deep,
personal relationship.

24:17.464 --> 24:19.364
I've been praying
with you and your family

24:19.366 --> 24:21.500
for the last 22 years.

24:21.502 --> 24:27.408
And it's as that person I ask,
"How are you feeling?"

24:32.246 --> 24:34.415
Almost...

24:36.684 --> 24:38.050
Ov... overwhelmed.

24:38.052 --> 24:40.752
Not by work or by the wedding.

24:40.754 --> 24:44.389
But my children are concerned about me,

24:44.391 --> 24:49.388
and they expressed
their fears to you, I c...

24:50.331 --> 24:53.642
Christ is here to take
those fears away from them.

24:54.476 --> 24:59.204
And to relieve you, also,
of all your worries.

24:59.206 --> 25:01.025
My worries.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.976
They're a lot to let go of.

25:03.978 --> 25:05.611
Which is the purpose of faith.

25:05.613 --> 25:09.615
We turn over that which
is beyond our control.

25:09.908 --> 25:11.316
And take comfort in the fact that,

25:11.318 --> 25:16.123
no matter what else happens,
God's will be done.

25:17.925 --> 25:19.960
Of course.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.173
His will be done.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.828
His will be done.

25:33.807 --> 25:36.041
We've taken a suspect into custody.

25:36.043 --> 25:39.778
But the defense will bring up
every hole in our investigation,

25:39.780 --> 25:42.581
and because you were in Mexico,
where the boys were found,

25:42.583 --> 25:44.549
we need an accurate timeline
of your travel

25:44.551 --> 25:46.051
over the last 12 days.

25:46.053 --> 25:48.153
I see. Okay.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.389
I'm not a 100% positive,
but I may have found

25:50.391 --> 25:52.057
where the boys were going
when they skipped out

25:52.059 --> 25:53.258
on the field trip.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.693
You don't need to be a 100% positive.

25:54.695 --> 25:57.796
No, at this point,
we'd be happy with a wild guess.

25:57.798 --> 25:59.765
Because he thought
he was coming right back,

25:59.767 --> 26:02.401
Lucas didn't take his backpack
like the other boys did.

26:02.403 --> 26:04.903
But he did take a small,
moleskin notebook,

26:04.905 --> 26:06.204
which we never found.

26:06.206 --> 26:08.040
I think the notebook
was to collect autographs.

26:08.042 --> 26:09.741
Autographs from whom?

26:09.927 --> 26:12.577
The L.A. Lakers rented out
their training facility

26:12.579 --> 26:14.413
in El Segundo for a movie shoot

26:14.415 --> 26:15.747
during the first week of November.

26:15.749 --> 26:17.616
And when they weren't
at the Staples Center,

26:17.618 --> 26:20.619
they practiced at USC, including
the day of the field trip.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.488
Also, the Garza practice was gifted

26:23.490 --> 26:28.360
four behind-courtside seats
at Lakers games in Section 101

26:28.362 --> 26:29.995
for Lakers home games.

26:29.997 --> 26:31.530
Best seats in the house.

26:31.532 --> 26:34.433
Maybe because they successfully
operated on so many Lakers.

26:34.435 --> 26:36.835
Doesn't going to visit
the Lakers support Dr. Garza

26:36.837 --> 26:39.104
as having been involved
in his son's murder?

26:39.106 --> 26:40.772
Not necessarily, no.

26:41.041 --> 26:43.775
This could cut quite a different way.

26:43.777 --> 26:45.110
Good work, Cami.

26:45.112 --> 26:47.813
Now we're only have a few
missing pieces of the puzzle.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.614
I see your trouble, but, um,

26:49.616 --> 26:51.917
shifting immigration policies
have demanded

26:51.919 --> 26:54.352
extraordinary measures on those of us

26:54.354 --> 26:57.289
working to keep families
united during crisis.

26:57.291 --> 26:59.758
And when it comes to
my travels to and from Mexico,

26:59.760 --> 27:01.626
my responsibility to Christ...

27:01.628 --> 27:03.228
Let me stop you
right there, okay, Father?

27:03.230 --> 27:06.965
Because when you talk about your
responsibilities to Christ,

27:06.967 --> 27:09.601
the defense will interrupt
and ask if that included

27:09.603 --> 27:12.904
refusing to use
birth control while having sex

27:12.906 --> 27:15.674
with the single moms
of some of your students.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.075
Yeah.

27:17.077 --> 27:19.144
Sorry, Father, but by not
answering our questions today,

27:19.146 --> 27:20.812
you'll be on the stand
explaining whether or not

27:20.814 --> 27:23.782
you used a condom when
having sex with Ms. Garza.

27:23.784 --> 27:25.884
I deserve this accusation.

27:25.886 --> 27:28.353
But I didn't have sex
with any of the boys' mothers.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.822
Including Sara Garza. That was not me.

27:30.824 --> 27:34.726
Okay then, Father,
if it wasn't you, who was it?

27:34.728 --> 27:37.429
Lucas only spoke about this
subject during confession.

27:37.431 --> 27:39.197
- I can't...
- Lucas is dead.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.834
And the privileged nature of
his confession died with him.

27:42.836 --> 27:45.837
No. No. The Seal of Confession
is never broken.

27:45.839 --> 27:47.906
Well, we just need to know
it wasn't you, Father.

27:47.908 --> 27:50.675
Do you really believe Lucas
would confess to me anything

27:50.677 --> 27:52.677
regarding his mother if he thought that

27:52.679 --> 27:54.179
- I slept with her?
- Hey, look, Padre.

27:54.181 --> 27:58.250
You have a pattern of behavior
the defense will use

27:58.252 --> 28:00.552
to build up reasonable doubt.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.788
You don't like the way
I'm questioning you now?

28:02.790 --> 28:04.890
Wait until you swear to tell the truth,

28:04.892 --> 28:08.026
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

28:08.028 --> 28:09.922
So help you God.

28:13.133 --> 28:14.432
Okay.

28:14.434 --> 28:16.201
- You want proof?
- Yeah.

28:16.203 --> 28:17.769
Here it is.

28:20.073 --> 28:25.777
I'm not physically,

28:25.779 --> 28:29.608
uh... tempted

28:30.918 --> 28:33.051
by Latinas.

28:33.593 --> 28:34.553
Excuse me?

28:34.555 --> 28:37.322
I'll identify all
of the women with whom I...

28:37.324 --> 28:39.224
I broke my vows.

28:39.226 --> 28:41.993
And you'll find
every one of them was white.

28:41.995 --> 28:43.562
I'm not proud of it.

28:43.564 --> 28:45.230
But Latinas just

28:45.232 --> 28:46.331
aren't my type.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.300
But you're a Latino yourself.

28:48.302 --> 28:50.035
That's all the explanation you get.

28:50.504 --> 28:52.537
And Lucas never told me
the name of the person

28:52.539 --> 28:54.105
with whom he thought
his mother was having

28:54.107 --> 28:55.173
an affair anyway,

28:55.175 --> 28:58.443
so that subject is closed.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.312
And this is the passport I use

29:00.314 --> 29:02.766
to get back and forth across the border.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.150
Diego Alcaraz?

29:05.152 --> 29:06.318
That's my brother.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.619
He died four years ago,

29:07.621 --> 29:10.722
but we look so much alike,
I never get stopped.

29:13.060 --> 29:14.593
But I don't understand.

29:14.595 --> 29:17.762
If Father Jonas wasn't having
an affair with Ms. Garza,

29:17.764 --> 29:19.032
who was?

29:20.734 --> 29:23.869
Ryan and will tell us.

29:26.156 --> 29:28.571
Mom, I don't think
you understand how complex

29:28.598 --> 29:29.511
this itinerary is.

29:29.512 --> 29:31.277
Everything has to be finished
at a certain time.

29:31.279 --> 29:32.746
I'm afraid that includes
the church, because we have

29:32.748 --> 29:36.182
a special Mass to say...
oh, uh, assuming you still

29:36.184 --> 29:37.550
want me to marry you.

29:37.552 --> 29:39.419
Of course, Father.
That's not the issue at all.

29:39.421 --> 29:40.920
Look, you can have two more hours.

29:40.922 --> 29:42.756
We'll wait and drive there together.

29:42.758 --> 29:45.258
Deal? You love deals! Deal?

29:45.260 --> 29:47.293
I have everything we need to do
your hair and makeup in the car.

29:47.295 --> 29:48.962
Yeah, and I have everyone's clothes,

29:48.964 --> 29:50.463
so you can change here or at the church.

29:50.465 --> 29:52.332
After the rehearsal...
Mom, Mom... we have

29:52.334 --> 29:54.768
a pre-paid dinner at 8:30
because the restaurant

29:54.770 --> 29:56.236
closes at 10:00.

29:56.872 --> 29:58.972
And no stress, okay?

29:58.974 --> 30:00.240
Yeah, no stress.

30:00.242 --> 30:02.575
Uh, one second. Just... Just one second.

30:02.577 --> 30:05.645
I have an answer to the schedule problem.

30:05.647 --> 30:08.448
Andy, Come with me, please.
I'll be right back.

30:08.450 --> 30:09.917
Just one second.

30:11.953 --> 30:14.320
Dr. Redmond.

30:14.322 --> 30:15.889
- Thank you for coming in.
- Of course.

30:15.891 --> 30:17.724
Did you bring everything you need to make

30:17.726 --> 30:19.559
the proper examinations?

30:19.561 --> 30:22.429
I did. But what do you
want me to say to these boys?

30:22.431 --> 30:25.398
Nothing yet. Just put what you need

30:25.400 --> 30:28.568
out on the table
and make sure they're watching

30:28.570 --> 30:29.602
what you're doing.

30:29.604 --> 30:31.838
Uh, Andy, if you would show Dr. Redmond

30:31.840 --> 30:33.039
to the conference room.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.908
Okay. Uh, what about the rehearsal?

30:34.910 --> 30:38.878
I'll take care of the kids if
you'll help Dr. Redmond set up.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.814
Thank you.

30:40.816 --> 30:42.048
Rehearsal?

30:42.050 --> 30:43.483
Yeah, we're getting married tomorrow.

30:43.931 --> 30:45.852
Congratulations. That's terrific.

30:45.854 --> 30:47.487
Well, it will be if it happens.

30:47.489 --> 30:48.488
In here, Doctor.

30:48.490 --> 30:50.056
Emily and I extended our tickets

30:50.058 --> 30:51.357
so we could hang out
a little while longer.

30:51.359 --> 30:55.228
Okay. We will talk about this later.

30:55.230 --> 30:57.297
I don't want or need anyone to rearrange

30:57.299 --> 30:58.998
their lives for me right now.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.200
- Seriously.
- Okay, well, back to

31:00.202 --> 31:01.868
the rehearsal just for a second.

31:01.870 --> 31:06.105
All that is required of me for
this rehearsal is to show up,

31:06.107 --> 31:08.675
look great, and walk down the aisle.

31:08.677 --> 31:10.176
I don't need to practice that.

31:10.178 --> 31:12.011
- But, Mom...
- I said, "I don't need

31:12.013 --> 31:13.646
to practice walking down the aisle."

31:13.648 --> 31:15.081
Now, if you'd like to stay,

31:15.083 --> 31:16.483
Rusty will show you to the break room.

31:16.485 --> 31:18.860
Father, I'll see you tonight.

31:21.389 --> 31:23.089
I think this is another
one of those moments

31:23.091 --> 31:25.458
in which prayer
is your very best answer.

31:25.460 --> 31:27.026
You always say that.

31:27.028 --> 31:28.528
- Ricky!
- What?

31:28.530 --> 31:31.064
The FBI found that one
of the Garza's patients,

31:31.066 --> 31:33.900
an Olympic skier from Canada
named Damien Edlow,

31:33.902 --> 31:36.302
used his passport to re-enter the U.S.

31:36.304 --> 31:38.538
through a Tijuana checkpoint
the same night that

31:38.540 --> 31:40.673
Miguel, Ryan, and Lucas were abducted.

31:40.675 --> 31:44.386
- Could that be him? Edlow?
- Uh, let me play it again.

31:46.414 --> 31:48.147
I can't tell what he looks like.

31:48.149 --> 31:49.382
Maybe that's the point.

31:49.384 --> 31:50.850
Well, I don't know who this guy is,

31:50.852 --> 31:52.385
but he's not Damien Edlow.

31:52.387 --> 31:56.289
Because I checked, and Edlow
had ACL surgery on his knee

31:56.291 --> 31:58.424
eight hours before this video was taken,

31:58.426 --> 32:00.360
and he was checked into a professional

32:00.362 --> 32:02.629
rehabilitation center
with nurses all around him.

32:02.631 --> 32:04.964
Well, it looks
a little more like Dr. Garza

32:04.966 --> 32:06.933
took the passport and abducted the kids.

32:06.935 --> 32:09.302
And he is our guy with
a connection to the Lakers.

32:09.304 --> 32:10.970
It seems to fit.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.272
And that's not Edlow at the border.

32:12.274 --> 32:13.873
- No, it's not.
- Excuse me, Commander.

32:13.875 --> 32:15.275
It's Dr. Morales downstairs,

32:15.277 --> 32:16.976
saying he has the photographs
you requested.

32:16.978 --> 32:19.412
Good. Please ask him to come on up,

32:19.414 --> 32:22.924
and, Lieutenant Provenza,
please notify Chief Mason

32:23.485 --> 32:26.019
we're about to make an arrest.

32:26.021 --> 32:28.221
Your case is almost over?
Who did it then?

32:28.223 --> 32:32.191
Sorry to inconvenience
you, but, as I explained,

32:32.193 --> 32:34.427
this should all be over very shortly

32:34.429 --> 32:35.695
and cause you no further pain.

32:35.697 --> 32:38.031
Um, I guess we're about to find out.

32:38.033 --> 32:41.701
Okay, so, I'm going
to do a very quick examination

32:41.703 --> 32:44.237
of the back of your throats
to check for any signs

32:44.239 --> 32:46.531
of bruising or scarring.

32:48.243 --> 32:49.475
Why the interest in our throats?

32:49.477 --> 32:51.177
You both said your throats hurt

32:51.179 --> 32:53.379
when you came to after the limo drive.

32:53.381 --> 32:55.381
And if you were telling
the truth, there could still be

32:55.383 --> 32:56.783
evidence of inflammation.

32:56.785 --> 33:00.320
Unless anyone here would
prefer we not look.

33:00.322 --> 33:02.455
Say the marks are there.
What does this prove?

33:02.457 --> 33:05.191
Maybe that whoever abducted
the boys used a stomach pump

33:05.193 --> 33:06.793
to force drugs into their systems.

33:06.795 --> 33:08.995
Okay. This is going to tickle a bit.

33:08.997 --> 33:11.515
Open wide. Wide.

33:13.768 --> 33:15.435
All right. Thank you.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.540
Okay.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.308
Using a stomach pump backwards?

33:22.310 --> 33:24.377
- Same for you. Head up.
- Except...

33:24.379 --> 33:25.712
- Mouth wide.
- Say the doctor

33:25.714 --> 33:26.980
doesn't find anything.

33:26.982 --> 33:28.915
That could be what's about to happen.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.483
Okay.

33:30.485 --> 33:31.884
- Dr. Redmond.
- Oh, my God.

33:31.886 --> 33:34.420
If he doesn't see anything, that means...

33:34.422 --> 33:36.823
I'm sorry. There's no sign of scarring,

33:36.825 --> 33:39.092
inflammation, or bruising
in their throats.

33:39.094 --> 33:40.727
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

33:40.729 --> 33:44.931
But you won't mind us getting
a second opinion, will you?

33:44.933 --> 33:46.341
Hi.

33:47.936 --> 33:49.369
Dr. Morales.

33:50.011 --> 33:50.903
What's going on?

33:50.905 --> 33:52.905
We're just checking the results
of your examinations

33:52.907 --> 33:55.341
against photographs of the boys'
throats taken this morning.

33:55.343 --> 33:58.411
Okay, if you already did an examination,

33:58.413 --> 33:59.646
then why did you have me look again?

33:59.648 --> 34:02.148
To catch you in a lie, Doctor.

34:02.150 --> 34:03.716
Yeah, but not as big a lie

34:03.718 --> 34:05.852
as promising Lucas
to take him and his friends

34:05.854 --> 34:07.186
to meet the Lakers,

34:07.188 --> 34:09.288
and then asking him not to tell anybody,

34:09.290 --> 34:11.456
including his mother and father.

34:11.458 --> 34:12.891
But Lucas trusted you.

34:12.893 --> 34:15.328
You were partners with his father.

34:15.330 --> 34:19.165
And maybe something more with his mother.

34:19.167 --> 34:20.299
Asshole!

34:20.301 --> 34:22.168
I hope they put you away for life.

34:22.170 --> 34:24.837
I know you asked us not to
object or... or speak

34:24.839 --> 34:26.130
during this...

34:26.541 --> 34:29.176
but look at how many
families you've destroyed.

34:29.610 --> 34:31.261
Just look!

34:31.813 --> 34:33.513
Oh, my God.

34:34.139 --> 34:36.449
As a physician,
you had access to chloroform.

34:36.451 --> 34:38.784
And could've acquired oxy
as easily as Mateo.

34:38.786 --> 34:42.455
And the reverse stomach pump
stunt did the rest.

34:42.456 --> 34:44.489
Here's the back of Ryan's throat.

34:44.492 --> 34:46.092
And the back of Miguel's.

34:46.094 --> 34:48.628
The marks are fainter,
naturally, but still visible.

34:48.630 --> 34:51.989
Matching up to the mark on Lucas and...

34:52.867 --> 34:54.233
Dr. Garza's throat.

34:54.235 --> 34:55.668
All this trouble, Doctor.

34:55.670 --> 34:57.503
Was it to get Sara Garza back?

34:57.871 --> 34:59.806
Because Lucas freaked out
when his mother brought up

34:59.808 --> 35:02.241
the idea of divorce and she left you?

35:02.243 --> 35:03.810
Do you think murdering her son

35:03.812 --> 35:07.046
and sprinkling oxy everywhere
would soften her heart?

35:07.048 --> 35:09.148
Or were you mainly after the practice?

35:09.150 --> 35:10.616
Sara managed the books.

35:10.618 --> 35:13.319
You covered for Garza
while he was in rehab.

35:13.321 --> 35:15.955
Did you get used to
the extra billing paid out

35:15.957 --> 35:17.190
to your account?

35:17.192 --> 35:18.591
Wait. Before you answer that,

35:18.593 --> 35:20.760
you have the right to remain silent.

35:20.762 --> 35:23.563
He dumped Lucas' friends down in Mexico,

35:23.565 --> 35:24.931
planted drugs on them,

35:24.933 --> 35:27.734
and came back using a patient's passport.

35:27.736 --> 35:30.236
I guess he thought the boys
would be kept in Mexico?

35:30.238 --> 35:32.872
And he knew about Lucas'
diabetic condition.

35:32.874 --> 35:35.775
He talked about it here a couple
of days ago in an interview.

35:35.777 --> 35:37.543
You're a sick little freak, aren't you?

35:37.545 --> 35:38.811
Oh, but don't worry.

35:38.813 --> 35:41.013
Sara already admitted to the affair.

35:41.015 --> 35:44.083
That's... No, she did not.

35:44.085 --> 35:46.052
- Oh.
- Oh, yes, she did, sir.

35:46.054 --> 35:50.523
So, Mrs. Garza admitted to
having an affair with this guy?

35:50.525 --> 35:52.692
- Uh...
- Ridiculous.

35:52.694 --> 35:55.495
- Broadly speaking.
- This is ridiculous.

35:55.497 --> 35:56.929
I haven't been to Mexico.

35:56.931 --> 35:58.531
Check the border. Check the border.

35:58.533 --> 35:59.832
You will see my name is...

35:59.834 --> 36:01.501
Is not Damien Edlow,

36:01.503 --> 36:05.671
who walked like he had
not just had knee surgery.

36:05.673 --> 36:09.008
No, Doctor, we won't find your name.

36:09.010 --> 36:10.576
But we found you.

36:10.578 --> 36:13.880
This guy. He used race,
church scandals, and politics

36:13.882 --> 36:17.575
to work up a country, all
because he was having an affair.

36:18.887 --> 36:20.186
I want a lawyer.

36:20.188 --> 36:22.789
Really? Why?

36:30.298 --> 36:32.498
Yeah, romance.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.426
Ain't love grand?

36:42.035 --> 36:44.545
Despite there being no question
of their status

36:44.570 --> 36:47.137
as illegal immigrants,
the Diaz family remains at large

36:47.139 --> 36:49.473
due to a technicality.

36:49.475 --> 36:52.569
Miguel, Miguel, how does
it feel to be home?

36:53.779 --> 36:56.079
Mr. Diaz, Mr. Diaz.

36:56.081 --> 36:58.215
Ryan Rojas remains in custody,

36:58.217 --> 37:00.050
arrested on the unrelated murder

37:00.052 --> 37:01.351
of his stepfather,

37:01.353 --> 37:02.419
though the D.A.'s Office

37:02.421 --> 37:04.221
plans on reducing those charges

37:04.223 --> 37:06.123
to manslaughter, and will not

37:06.125 --> 37:08.094
try Ryan as an adult.

37:08.119 --> 37:11.354
With the explosive arrest
of Dr. Alan Redmond yesterday

37:11.356 --> 37:14.357
and the discovery of the limo
he purchased off Craigslist,

37:14.359 --> 37:17.427
the police have closed the case
of the St. Joseph's Three,

37:17.429 --> 37:21.097
leaving Sara Garza to mourn
the loss of her entire family.

37:21.099 --> 37:24.667
Meanwhile the priests
of the Los Angeles Archdiocese

37:24.669 --> 37:26.703
return to their pastoral duties.

37:26.705 --> 37:29.239
Shrugging off complaints about personnel,

37:29.241 --> 37:31.040
Bishop Calhoun says

37:31.042 --> 37:32.342
the Catholic Church will

37:32.344 --> 37:34.310
"continue to serve its community

37:34.312 --> 37:36.012
with faith and humility."

37:42.595 --> 37:43.842
Hey.

37:43.844 --> 37:45.421
- Now?
- No, no, no, not yet.

37:45.423 --> 37:46.489
Just a few more seconds.

37:46.491 --> 37:47.757
We should go last.

37:47.759 --> 37:49.826
It takes so long after we get there.

37:49.828 --> 37:51.261
What? You want to miss the whole wedding?

37:51.263 --> 37:52.729
The bride always goes last.

37:52.731 --> 37:54.760
And no talking once
we get in there, all right?

37:55.567 --> 37:57.934
Wait, I got a shoe, I got a shoe.

37:57.936 --> 37:59.235
Go, go, go, go, go.

37:59.237 --> 38:02.539
Oh, when this is over,
and she throws the bouquet,

38:02.541 --> 38:03.907
I am closing my eyes.

38:03.909 --> 38:05.441
Toss it my way. I'm ready.

38:05.443 --> 38:06.676
She's not going to throw

38:06.678 --> 38:08.177
- a bouquet.
- Oh, the hell she won't.

38:08.179 --> 38:10.313
This wedding is going to be
conducted by the book.

38:10.315 --> 38:11.814
You just watch. Go on.

39:14.145 --> 39:15.879
How do I look?

39:17.282 --> 39:19.582
Better than usual.

40:08.033 --> 40:09.499
God.

40:09.501 --> 40:11.601
They really are like a family.

40:11.603 --> 40:14.370
Oh, you have no idea.

40:14.372 --> 40:16.689
Sure you want to be a part of it?

40:18.877 --> 40:21.544
How's your heart holding up?

40:21.546 --> 40:24.697
It's never been so full.

40:25.650 --> 40:29.552
I'm just so happy to have this day.

40:29.554 --> 40:31.521
I'm so happy.

40:31.523 --> 40:33.998
And we're so happy for you.
