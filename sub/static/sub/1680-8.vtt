00:01.070 --> 00:04.300
the early bloom of romantics is a wonderful thing.

00:04.330 --> 00:07.900
you meet someone, you have a connection, and that person

00:07.970 --> 00:09.900
becomes sheer perfection in your eyes.

00:09.970 --> 00:12.570
you just can't find anything wrong with them.

00:12.630 --> 00:14.830
you can't wait to tell the world about it.

00:14.900 --> 00:16.300
she convinced you to go jogging?

00:16.370 --> 00:19.200
wow, you really want to get in this girl's pants.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.130
i'm telling you, you guys are gonna love her.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.530
lily, she knows all about art.

00:22.600 --> 00:23.830
marshall,

00:23.900 --> 00:25.270
she's open to the existence of ufos.

00:25.330 --> 00:26.570
barney,

00:26.630 --> 00:27.800
she's hot. robin,

00:27.870 --> 00:29.270
she's not hotter than you.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.729
-like her already. -how not hotter?

00:32.800 --> 00:35.000
so we all went out to dinner, and i couldn't wait

00:35.070 --> 00:37.770
to see if my friends were as crazy about cathy as i was.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.430
so, what's everyone getting?

00:39.500 --> 00:41.570
well, i can't decide.

00:41.630 --> 00:43.700
which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?

00:43.770 --> 00:46.830
lasagna. just get the lasagna!

00:46.900 --> 00:49.530
oh. you guys just got a new place.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.130
how many bedrooms is it?

00:51.200 --> 00:53.370
two. it's two bedrooms!

00:56.200 --> 00:58.670
okay! let's hear it.

00:58.730 --> 00:59.970
what's wrong with cathy?

01:00.030 --> 01:02.770
are you kidding me, ted? she's got a...

01:02.830 --> 01:04.569
you n't notice it?

01:04.769 --> 01:05.470
notice what?

01:05.670 --> 01:07.130
oh, he doesn't see it.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.800
if we point it out, we're gonna ruin her for him.

01:09.870 --> 01:10.900
as his friends,

01:10.970 --> 01:12.970
we'll just keep him in the dark.

01:13.030 --> 01:13.830
you're right.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.800
she's great, man.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.230
she's a keeper. just...

01:18.300 --> 01:19.000
keep her somewhere else.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.800
marshall, what is everyone's problem with cathy?

01:37.870 --> 01:39.170
oh, she's a total nightmare, ted,

01:39.230 --> 01:40.270
but can we talk about this later?

01:40.330 --> 01:41.730
i'm a minute away

01:41.800 --> 01:43.670
from finding out if i'm gonna be a lawyer or not.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.070
you see, kids, during the summer,

01:45.130 --> 01:47.000
marshall had taken the new york bar exam.

01:47.070 --> 01:50.070
his years of school, his countless hours of study,

01:50.130 --> 01:53.030
had finally culminated in this grueling, two-day ordeal.

01:53.100 --> 01:55.300
and... begin.

01:58.330 --> 02:00.100
the pressure of it was enormous.

02:00.170 --> 02:03.100
every year, people taking the bar simply cracked.

02:03.170 --> 02:05.570
no! no!

02:05.630 --> 02:06.730
no!

02:06.800 --> 02:10.830
no!

02:12.130 --> 02:13.300
but marshall had made it through.

02:13.370 --> 02:14.300
and...

02:14.370 --> 02:15.630
time.

02:22.570 --> 02:24.200
time's up.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.300
right.

02:25.370 --> 02:26.130
time.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
-sir. -i know.

02:28.270 --> 02:29.970
-your time is... -i know it is.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.030
give me...!

02:33.130 --> 02:36.270
now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled

02:36.330 --> 02:38.330
the post online at 10 o'clock

02:38.400 --> 02:39.700
and this is 9:59.

02:39.770 --> 02:41.230
damn, they're not up yet.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.800
oh, don't worry, baby. i'm sure you rocked it.

02:43.870 --> 02:45.800
i mean, how many people fail the bar?

02:45.870 --> 02:46.670
half.

02:46.730 --> 02:48.030
oh, my god, half?

02:48.030 --> 02:50.170
only half the people pass?

02:50.230 --> 02:51.430
i mean, half the people pass.

02:51.500 --> 02:52.430
that's fantastic.

02:52.500 --> 02:53.530
go, marshall.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.130
oh, hey, can i jump on there?

02:55.200 --> 02:57.230
i want to show you something awesome. what?

02:57.300 --> 02:59.230
no. bar results. my future.

02:59.300 --> 03:00.800
trust me. you need to see this.

03:00.870 --> 03:03.300
what is so important that i need to see it right now?

03:03.370 --> 03:07.000
it's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.

03:08.270 --> 03:10.730
how do i need to see that?

03:10.800 --> 03:12.570
why would i want to see that?

03:12.630 --> 03:17.200
in what possible way could subjecting my eyes and my brain

03:17.270 --> 03:19.230
to something that disgusting enrich my life?

03:19.300 --> 03:23.730
it's a dog pooping on a baby.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.200
get away from my computer.

03:25.270 --> 03:28.770
okay, just do a quick google search for "caca spaniel."

03:28.830 --> 03:29.770
the results are in.

03:29.830 --> 03:31.430
whoo. what's it say?

03:31.500 --> 03:33.330
"input password."

03:33.400 --> 03:35.300
input the password.

03:35.370 --> 03:37.430
it's okay. they assigned it to me when i took the test.

03:37.500 --> 03:39.430
it's gotta be around here somewhere.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.470
here. here-here-here.

03:41.530 --> 03:43.600
jelly beans, fluffernutter, gummi bears, ginger snaps...

03:43.670 --> 03:45.370
this is a grocery list.

03:45.430 --> 03:47.230
for who? a witch building a house in the forest?

03:48.700 --> 03:50.570
sugar helps me study.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.130
this is like the shopping a ten-year-old does

03:53.200 --> 03:55.070
when his parents leave him alone for the weekend.

03:55.130 --> 03:57.730
what parent leaves a ten- year-old alone for the weekend?

03:57.800 --> 04:00.030
and your mom was perfect.

04:00.100 --> 04:02.270
i can't find my password! okay, just...

04:02.330 --> 04:04.170
can't you let 'em know that you lost it

04:04.230 --> 04:05.770
and they'll e-mail it to you or something?

04:05.830 --> 04:07.530
no! they won't let me do that.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.500
i'm gonna have to wait till the results come in the regular mail.

04:10.570 --> 04:11.930
that could be weeks from now, if ever!

04:12.000 --> 04:13.900
our mail carrier hates me ever since i asked her

04:13.970 --> 04:14.930
when the baby was due.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.170
she wasn't pregnant?

04:16.230 --> 04:17.829
no, he was not.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.700
ooh. okey, well, that's a drag,

04:19.800 --> 04:20.970
but the results will come eventually.

04:21.029 --> 04:23.000
just try to keep it off your mind until then.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.570
hey, brad.

04:27.630 --> 04:29.900
oh, congratulations, man.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.770
i'm, uh... i'm not sure yet.

04:32.830 --> 04:35.100
i lost my password.

04:35.170 --> 04:37.430
that's great, cara.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.870
i don't know yet. i lost my password.

04:39.930 --> 04:42.230
i don't know how i lost it!

04:42.300 --> 04:43.500
this staff happens!

04:43.570 --> 04:46.900
oh. ohh! you're one to talk.

04:46.970 --> 04:49.930
you misplace stuff all the time.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.570
i'm sorry.

04:51.630 --> 04:54.670
i'm sure the nurses are stealing your medicine, grandma.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.300
love you too.

04:57.370 --> 05:00.030
if i have to wait six weeks to find out if i passed,

05:00.100 --> 05:01.830
i-'m gonna have a heart attack.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.630
based on that grocery list, i'd say diabetes is a bigger worry.

05:05.700 --> 05:07.230
you know what? laugh all you want.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.030
this affects my whole future, all right?

05:10.100 --> 05:11.470
okay.

05:11.530 --> 05:12.800
i probably shouldn't be telling you this.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.230
i definitely shouldn't be telling you this,

05:14.300 --> 05:16.670
but there is a way i can help you with your problem.

05:16.730 --> 05:18.100
how?

05:19.270 --> 05:20.870
i know a guy at work

05:20.930 --> 05:24.700
he can get access to software designed to penetrate firewalls

05:24.770 --> 05:26.870
and retrieve passwords through secure servers.

05:26.930 --> 05:28.870
i can get into any computer.

05:28.930 --> 05:31.600
so what do we do? like, arrange a secret meeting

05:31.670 --> 05:33.230
in a darkened parking structure?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.600
no.

05:34.670 --> 05:35.230
can we?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.200
no

05:36.270 --> 05:37.170
i have a trench coat.

05:37.230 --> 05:38.300
dude, be cool.

05:42.060 --> 05:44.500
so, i just got off the phone with cathy.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.000
god, you guys are so right.

05:46.060 --> 05:47.660
i totally hear it now.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.700
see it now?

05:50.730 --> 05:51.630
smell it?

05:52.930 --> 05:53.930
what is it?!

05:54.000 --> 05:55.330
i left the table for two minutes.

05:55.400 --> 05:56.700
what could she have possibly done

05:56.760 --> 05:58.660
in that time that was so horrible? was it...

05:58.730 --> 06:00.300
i'll be back in one second.

06:01.930 --> 06:05.160
one time, in the tenth grade, as a joke, i told everyone

06:05.230 --> 06:08.760
that my english teacher had sex with me.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.860
he's still in jail.

06:12.730 --> 06:13.760
or maybe...

06:13.830 --> 06:15.600
i'll be back in a second.

06:17.130 --> 06:19.160
so i volunte at the pound.

06:19.230 --> 06:21.000
oh, isn't that nice?

06:21.060 --> 06:23.860
yeah. you can't imagine the rush

06:23.880 --> 06:26.600
you getrush you get from killing a unwanted dog

06:27.100 --> 06:29.530
i make bracelets from out of the collars.puppy

06:30.700 --> 06:31.660
or...

06:31.730 --> 06:33.160
||i'll be back in one second.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.530
i bet he's going to the urinal.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.960
yeah.

06:40.030 --> 06:41.700
i remember when i had a penis.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.960
it wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.800
it's just the way she is.

06:47.860 --> 06:49.730
i don't get it.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.200
if it's so obvious and you guys all see it,

06:51.260 --> 06:52.900
how come i don't?

06:52.960 --> 06:54.600
cause we're not trying to have sex with her.

06:54.660 --> 06:56.100
mmm. brother,

06:56.160 --> 06:58.000
you're driving the "i want to have sex with her" truck,

06:58.060 --> 07:00.030
and it's got a huge blind spot.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.000
that's ridiculous.

07:02.060 --> 07:03.760
is it really?

07:03.830 --> 07:05.900
ted, let me tell you a little story

07:05.960 --> 07:09.130
about a young lady i wanted to have sex with-- lucilia.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.030
on a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro,

07:13.100 --> 07:16.960
we made love for ten straight hours.

07:17.030 --> 07:18.260
when we were done,

07:18.330 --> 07:19.900
she applauded

07:19.960 --> 07:22.900
and told me i was far, far better

07:22.960 --> 07:25.930
than the best lover she could possibly imagine,

07:26.030 --> 07:30.530
and that i had restored her faith in god.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.400
what does this have to do with cathy?

07:33.460 --> 07:35.130
who's cathy?

07:36.230 --> 07:37.600
just tell me what the hell

07:37.660 --> 07:39.000
is wrong with her already.

07:39.060 --> 07:41.260
okay. you want to know?

07:41.330 --> 07:42.260
yes.

07:42.330 --> 07:43.660
you want to shatter

07:43.730 --> 07:45.430
this beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?

07:45.500 --> 07:47.200
fine. here it is.

07:47.260 --> 07:52.430
cathy talks... a lot.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.560
oh, come on.

07:55.630 --> 07:56.830
that's not true.

07:56.900 --> 08:00.300
ted. really, really think about that dinner

08:00.360 --> 08:01.530
we all just had together.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.000
and i did.

08:03.060 --> 08:04.930
so, what's everyone getting?

08:05.000 --> 08:07.060
well, i can't decide.

08:07.130 --> 08:09.200
which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?

08:09.260 --> 08:10.260
i like chicken.

08:10.330 --> 08:11.660
i like lasagna. i like them both,

08:11.730 --> 08:12.830
but i really like pork

08:12.900 --> 08:13.930
a lot of people don't

08:14.000 --> 08:15.130
eat pork, and maybe it's because

08:15.200 --> 08:16.360
of that movie babe or something.

08:16.430 --> 08:17.460
but that was funny.

08:17.530 --> 08:18.500
he was a talking pig

08:18.560 --> 08:19.600
and he was like "bah, ram, ewe!"

08:19.660 --> 08:20.730
what-what if

08:20.800 --> 08:22.230
there was a sorority, "bah, ram, ewe?"

08:22.300 --> 08:23.360
i'd totally rush it.

08:23.430 --> 08:26.300
...and so i named him dr. seuss!

08:26.360 --> 08:27.960
lorax is a funny word.

08:28.030 --> 08:30.560
lasagna! just get the lasagna!

08:30.630 --> 08:33.330
oh, you guys just got a new place.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.799
how many bedrooms is it?

08:34.860 --> 08:35.830
i would love

08:35.900 --> 08:37.130
to have an extra bedroom,

08:37.200 --> 08:38.429
because i would put a stairmaster in there.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.230
i'll be back in one second.

08:40.299 --> 08:41.600
or a futon. futons are great.

08:41.659 --> 08:42.700
or what about one of those

08:42.760 --> 08:43.659
murphy beds?

08:43.730 --> 08:44.600
who invented the murphy bed?

08:44.660 --> 08:45.530
was it a guy named murphy?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.000
oh, my god.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.360
do you guys remember thatshow murphy brown?

08:48.430 --> 08:49.730
that was a funny show.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.530
she had a new assistant every episode.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.000
...and it was like half an hour

08:53.060 --> 08:55.130
before i realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore!

08:55.200 --> 08:57.200
isn't that hysterical?

08:57.260 --> 08:59.130
two! it's two bedrooms!

08:59.200 --> 09:02.330
hey, do you guys like cannolis?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.230
because i know this place and it's in the south bronx

09:04.300 --> 09:05.400
and you wouldn't expect it,

09:05.460 --> 09:07.400
but they have the best cannolis in town.

09:09.060 --> 09:11.060
and just like that, the illusion was shattered.

09:12.460 --> 09:15.730
she just never shuts up, does she?

09:15.800 --> 09:17.230
she didn't stop

09:17.300 --> 09:18.900
to swallow her food.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.030
i was scared for her.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.800
i didn't want her to choke.

09:22.400 --> 09:23.300
at first

09:27.530 --> 09:30.030
so kids,the girl i was dating would not stop talking.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.100
can you imagine how awful that is?

09:33.800 --> 09:37.030
somebody got stay me here because the thing i am going out has so much.

09:37.030 --> 09:38.630
do you own a work?

09:38.700 --> 09:41.030
cause that's really how...

09:41.100 --> 09:43.700
don't you just love autumn?

09:43.770 --> 09:45.270
today i'm dressed for.

09:45.330 --> 09:47.870
oh, my god. the sweetest thing.

09:47.930 --> 09:50.600
and i know this great place where we can go.

09:50.670 --> 09:52.400
they have guys and girls clothes.

09:52.470 --> 09:54.070
we could both shop at the same time.

09:54.130 --> 09:56.070
and a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...

09:57.230 --> 09:58.730
why are you running so fast?

09:59.730 --> 10:02.370
well, thank you, pal.

10:02.430 --> 10:04.100
you and your little friends,

10:04.170 --> 10:05.400
you just had to tell me.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.670
you just to give in to my incessant begging.

10:07.730 --> 10:09.100
you said that you wanted to know.

10:09.170 --> 10:10.900
i didn't want to know!

10:10.970 --> 10:12.630
you said you wanted to know!

10:12.700 --> 10:14.900
well, i didn't know i didn't want to know!

10:14.970 --> 10:16.930
you knew. and you know me.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.500
and you should have known i didn't want to know!

10:19.570 --> 10:21.470
you know?

10:21.530 --> 10:23.270
i'm sorry we told you.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.470
i'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.

10:25.530 --> 10:27.000
there's only a finite combination of words

10:27.070 --> 10:28.570
in the english language.

10:28.630 --> 10:30.870
well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer.

10:30.930 --> 10:31.770
she's got all these

10:31.830 --> 10:33.330
other great qualities.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.200
she's smart. she's caring. she loves animals...

10:35.270 --> 10:37.030
you know how to teach her a lesson?

10:37.100 --> 10:38.100
buy her a parrot.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.330
oh, come on. i'm sorry that we told you, okay?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.370
it's part of being in a relationship.

10:44.430 --> 10:46.770
eventually, you get used to these annoying little things

10:46.830 --> 10:48.030
that bug you at first.

10:48.100 --> 10:49.830
yeah, i guess.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.230
i mean, you got used to lily's loud chewing, right?

10:54.370 --> 10:56.030
lily doesn't chew loudly.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.100
dude...

10:58.170 --> 11:00.270
come on. this isn't news.

11:00.370 --> 11:02.000
Why do you think I call her "Chewbacca"?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.130
i assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts

11:05.200 --> 11:07.470
and i resemble a young harrison ford.

11:07.530 --> 11:09.570
think about it.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.530
oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing

11:40.630 --> 11:41.700
you've ever done to me.

11:41.770 --> 11:43.570
i really thought you knew.

11:43.630 --> 11:46.230
we had ribs the other night. it sounded like jurassic park.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.470
ha-ha-ha. you know what?

11:48.530 --> 11:49.900
it doesn't matter.

11:49.970 --> 11:50.970
but it did.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.330
say, what's in that cereal

12:13.400 --> 12:16.730
besides dry twigs and small animal bones?

12:16.800 --> 12:18.600
what's that supposed to mean?

12:18.670 --> 12:21.700
lily, i love you, but honest to god,

12:21.770 --> 12:24.000
when you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal

12:24.070 --> 12:25.170
full of drywall screws.

12:25.230 --> 12:27.800
what's the matter with you?

12:27.870 --> 12:30.070
we've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?

12:30.130 --> 12:34.000
well, i never noticed it before until...

12:34.070 --> 12:35.370
until what?

12:35.430 --> 12:36.830
can you believe ted?

12:36.900 --> 12:39.870
what a lame thing to say, that i'm a loud chewer.

12:41.800 --> 12:44.430
yeah, that's crazy.

12:46.570 --> 12:48.730
maybe enough with the pretzels.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.930
oh, my god, do i really chew that loudly?

12:52.000 --> 12:54.630
no, no, no.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.430
okay, now that you pointed it out,

12:57.500 --> 13:01.400
maybe it does sound slightly like someone put

13:01.470 --> 13:03.830
a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener,

13:03.900 --> 13:05.070
but in a cute way.

13:05.130 --> 13:07.970
this is all ted's fault.

13:08.030 --> 13:10.700
oh, like he's so perfect, mr. corrector.

13:10.770 --> 13:12.000
what do you mean?

13:12.070 --> 13:14.200
oh, come on. you dated the guy for a year

13:14.270 --> 13:16.770
and you never noticed that most of what ted says

13:16.830 --> 13:17.970
is correcting you.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.270
hey, can you hand me a kleenex?

13:21.330 --> 13:24.400
actually, kleenex is a brand.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.000
this is a facial tissue.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.400
oh, my god, is frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?

13:30.470 --> 13:32.930
uh, dr. frankenstein isn't in this scene.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.530
that's frankenstein's monster.

13:36.770 --> 13:40.800
that literally blew my mind.

13:40.870 --> 13:42.400
figuratively.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.100
oh, my god, you're right.

13:47.170 --> 13:49.400
that is so annoying.

13:49.470 --> 13:51.000
isn't it?

13:51.070 --> 13:54.130
where are those pretzels from, ace hardware?

14:01.370 --> 14:02.430
hey, man,

14:02.500 --> 14:03.800
you like kettle corn?

14:03.870 --> 14:04.770
i'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.

14:04.830 --> 14:06.170
are the blinds closed?

14:06.230 --> 14:07.370
i don't know.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.030
are the blinds closed?!

14:11.970 --> 14:13.470
good, i didn't think yes, the blindsi was followed,|

14:13.530 --> 14:14.730
but you can never be too sure.

14:14.800 --> 14:15.800
now double-lock the door

14:15.800 --> 14:17.400
and stay away from the windows.

14:17.470 --> 14:20.670
is there a reason that you're acting like this?

14:20.730 --> 14:23.030
we're about to find out if you're a lawyer.

14:23.100 --> 14:25.470
now, in good conscience, i have to inform you

14:25.530 --> 14:26.630
that using his software

14:26.700 --> 14:28.330
is in violation of the patriot act,

14:28.400 --> 14:30.730
the strategic defense initiative,

14:30.800 --> 14:34.670
and the national security act of 1948, which created to cia.

14:34.730 --> 14:37.370
so i hope you passed the bar because

14:37.430 --> 14:41.230
if we use this software, the night janitor gligor

14:41.230 --> 14:43.430
who i fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer,

14:43.500 --> 14:46.000
is going to need a good lawyer.

14:46.070 --> 14:47.430
are you certain you want to go through with this?

14:47.500 --> 14:51.330
i have to know, yes, yes.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.770
very good.

14:53.830 --> 14:56.370
first, we go to the new york state bar web site.

14:56.430 --> 14:59.630
we disable the firewall, then the recursive algorithm

14:59.700 --> 15:03.470
grabs your pasord, and as the application erases itself

15:03.530 --> 15:06.730
leaving no trace we we here ever...

15:06.800 --> 15:09.430
you ready to see your future, bro?

15:09.500 --> 15:10.770
yes.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.700
it's a dog pooping on a baby.

15:21.770 --> 15:24.230
right! isn't that awesome?

15:24.300 --> 15:25.630
so you went through all this just to get me

15:25.700 --> 15:26.800
to look at your stupid video?

15:26.870 --> 15:28.200
yeah, it was worth it.

15:28.270 --> 15:30.770
barney, barney, that was the biggest test of my life.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.530
i'm incredibly stressed out right now, and i...

15:35.200 --> 15:37.170
okay, that's pretty funny.

15:38.170 --> 15:39.500
you got to see this.

15:39.570 --> 15:44.530
uh-huh, yeah, i have to...

15:44.600 --> 15:47.500
she'll call back when she realizes i'm gone.

15:47.570 --> 15:49.500
probably in about 45 minutes.

15:52.730 --> 15:53.800
you guys want a drink?

15:53.870 --> 15:55.370
i'll just have a water.

15:55.430 --> 15:57.200
mm, technically, water is a drink.

15:58.270 --> 15:59.630
really, professor?

15:59.700 --> 16:01.370
you drink it? is that how water works?

16:01.430 --> 16:03.330
because i was just gonna smear it on my skin

16:03.400 --> 16:04.600
and hope that i absorbed it.

16:05.870 --> 16:08.170
or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt.

16:08.230 --> 16:09.630
what's with you?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.230
you're always correcting people.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.700
-you totally do that! -that's absolutely right.

16:14.770 --> 16:16.500
right? i never noticed it before,

16:16.570 --> 16:18.300
and now it's literally driving me crazy.

16:18.370 --> 16:19.970
figuratively.

16:20.030 --> 16:22.030
okay, maybe so, but it's no worse

16:22.100 --> 16:24.000
than you using the word "literally"

16:24.070 --> 16:25.200
in every other sentence.

16:25.270 --> 16:28.770
don't they teach vocabulary in canada?

16:28.830 --> 16:32.100
they literally don't. they literally don't.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.330
shut up, marshall.

16:33.400 --> 16:34.670
that's nothing compared

16:34.730 --> 16:36.670
to your thing of singing what you do all the time.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.170
what?

16:38.370 --> 16:42.270
Paying my bills using return address labels

16:42.370 --> 16:46.370
From a charity that I haven't given money to

16:48.570 --> 16:53.370
Writing a check  cause now I feel guilty

16:53.810 --> 16:56.910
The Salivation Army does not fight fair.

17:00.430 --> 17:03.400
Heading down to the basement today

17:03.420 --> 17:05.700
With my laundry  and a roll of quarters

17:10.300 --> 17:11.000
But I'm back too soon

17:11.099 --> 17:12.000
Cause I left  the detergent

17:12.099 --> 17:14.400
And the fabric softener

17:17.300 --> 17:19.869
wow. those lines are so sloppy.

17:19.869 --> 17:20.829
oh, come on!

17:20.900 --> 17:23.170
what about you, "barney"?

17:23.230 --> 17:25.900
okay, you...

17:26.770 --> 17:27.670
always...

17:27.730 --> 17:28.870
interesting, interesting,

17:28.930 --> 17:30.730
everyone has annoying habits but me.

17:30.800 --> 17:33.430
oh, got it.

17:33.500 --> 17:38.430
okay, you sometimes talk in a weird high-pitched voice.

17:38.500 --> 17:43.870
and you're constantly using lame catchphrases.

17:43.930 --> 17:47.100
and sometimes you space out and don't even pay attention

17:47.170 --> 17:48.470
to what we're talking about.

17:50.230 --> 17:52.300
i'm sorry. what?

17:52.370 --> 17:53.400
oh, see?

17:53.470 --> 17:54.830
you can't think of anything

17:54.830 --> 17:56.930
cause i am aewsome

17:57.000 --> 17:58.570
all three right the.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.330
well, technically, "awesome" wouldn't be a catchphrase.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.800
if anything, it's more of a catchword.

18:01.870 --> 18:04.370
i literally want to rip your head off.

18:04.430 --> 18:06.570
you mean "figuratively"!

18:06.630 --> 18:09.430
no, i literally mean "literally."

18:09.500 --> 18:12.870
literally, literally literally.

18:12.930 --> 18:15.570
oh, my god, lily, what are you eating, gravel?

18:15.630 --> 18:16.900
oh, i know, right?

18:16.970 --> 18:18.730
it sounds like cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.600
well, why don't you sing about it?

18:20.670 --> 18:23.300
because i don't sing about everything i do.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.600
no, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense sentences

18:26.670 --> 18:27.730
like a stroke victim,

18:27.800 --> 18:29.100
and what's worse,

18:29.170 --> 18:30.570
they're catchy.

18:30.670 --> 18:33.070
Apple,orchard,banana, cat dance,

18:35.030 --> 18:37.130
see? we know that one because once you sang that

18:37.200 --> 18:40.130
for, like, three hours. what the hell is that?

18:40.200 --> 18:42.600
that's my password.

18:44.100 --> 18:46.400
AOBCD8663
AOBCD8663.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.130
-oh, marshall! -awesome!

18:53.200 --> 18:54.800
there's another one.

18:54.870 --> 18:56.930
it's called "golden reliever," where this dog... yeah,

18:57.000 --> 18:58.270
-we can guess. -all right, guys,

18:58.330 --> 18:59.970
guys, guys.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.370
i'm a lawyer.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.270
it just like that

19:09.330 --> 19:11.870
we stopped fighting and celebrated marshall's success.

19:11.930 --> 19:14.130
you see, when someone's bad habits are pointed out to you,

19:14.200 --> 19:15.770
it's hard to ignore them.

19:15.830 --> 19:18.270
i'm a lawyer now cause i passed the bar

19:18.330 --> 19:21.200
i'm imposing marshall law on this champagne.

19:22.570 --> 19:25.200
are you literally on cloud nine right now?

19:25.270 --> 19:27.070
baby, you never have to take the bar again.

19:28.570 --> 19:30.500
actually, if he practices law in another state,

19:30.570 --> 19:31.800
he will have to,

19:31.870 --> 19:33.130
but new york, man!

19:33.200 --> 19:34.500
it's a great state to practice law in!

19:34.570 --> 19:36.170
lawsuit up!

19:36.230 --> 19:37.200
yeah! whoo!

19:37.270 --> 19:38.500
yeah! yeah!

19:38.570 --> 19:40.270
but if you love them enough,

19:40.770 --> 19:42.570
those bad habits are easy to forgive

19:46.300 --> 19:48.200
3 years later i ran into cathy

19:48.210 --> 19:49.500
and she was doing well.

19:49.570 --> 19:50.930
ted?!

19:51.000 --> 19:53.600
oh, my god, i haven't seen you in so long!

19:53.670 --> 19:55.130
how long has it been? three years? no, four.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.400
no, three, 'cause i went blonde and then i went back

19:56.470 --> 19:57.830
