WEBVTT

01:15.109 --> 01:16.141
What?

01:16.143 --> 01:17.476
Never again, no horror movies.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.712
Come on, no, the first kill
was amazing.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.781
Oh, look, he texted me
like three times since
we went in there.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.750
Anything good?

01:24.752 --> 01:28.153
No, just basically saying
"what's up?" In several
different ways.

01:28.155 --> 01:29.354
Uh-huh.

01:29.356 --> 01:30.522
What are you doing now?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.491
I have to go home and study.

01:32.493 --> 01:37.229
That's so lame. No, come over to
my house, we'll watch a movie.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.231
We literally just watched
a movie.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.667
Yeah, but studying... sucks.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.869
I know, I know, I got to.
I'll call you later.

01:43.871 --> 01:47.439
All right--
hey, where'd you park?

01:47.441 --> 01:48.874
So, let me drive you.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.542
It's 50 feet away.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.610
All right, fine.
I love you.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.145
Bye. Love you.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.751
Help!

05:54.555 --> 05:55.987
Oh, fuck!

08:57.905 --> 09:00.071
Miss hannaford, in a minute...

09:00.073 --> 09:02.307
I'm gonna ask you to take a look
at the statement you gave us...

09:02.309 --> 09:04.209
And uh... sign it.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.114
Wait, the camera doesn't
show anything?

09:09.116 --> 09:11.182
Well, the camera in the foyer
there doesn't show
the bulletin board.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.051
Can't you move it?

09:13.053 --> 09:15.320
I mean, how many more of these
do I have to keep on finding?

09:15.322 --> 09:19.724
Well, then we'd be looking
at the doors, which is why
the store has the camera there.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.794
Someone made that image
and sneaked it past cameras
to post it up there...

09:22.796 --> 09:25.096
For anyone to see,
for a kid to see...

09:25.098 --> 09:27.666
Doesn't that make you feel like,
i don't know, maybe it's not
a good thing?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.935
It is a graphic depiction.

09:29.937 --> 09:31.970
It's not a crime, though.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.639
It's not a crime to make 'em,
not a crime to show 'em.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.207
It's poor taste.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.577
The girl in the photographs,
she's someone, isn't she?

09:38.579 --> 09:41.713
There's no way for me to look at
this and even know if it's real.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.783
Unless we can link it to some
kind of actual criminal
activity...

09:44.785 --> 09:47.719
A body, or ID on a missing
person. But this--

09:47.721 --> 09:49.254
no body, no crime.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.056
Wait, but this one's numbered.
You saw that.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.724
It's numbered seven
at the bottom.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.859
Well, it's probably some kind
of a art thing...

09:54.861 --> 09:57.829
Some kind of a numbered art
thing, street art.

09:57.831 --> 09:58.897
What do they call it?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.265
Uh...

10:00.267 --> 10:02.834
Outsider art.
Yep.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.636
Okay, has anyone else
seen these?

10:04.638 --> 10:05.904
Or are they just for me?

10:05.906 --> 10:07.205
Is that what's concerning
you here?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.774
Yes, has anyone else
turned them in?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.611
No. No, I don't think so.

10:12.613 --> 10:15.680
So, they're art,
but just for me to see?

10:15.682 --> 10:18.049
So I would encourage you
not to take this personally.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.718
Great.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.786
Do you know any photographers?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.888
No, I don't.

10:23.890 --> 10:28.727
Well, we got your statement, so
I'm gonna ask you to take a look
at it...

10:28.729 --> 10:35.133
And sign it... right there.
There you go.

12:53.440 --> 12:58.076
How can I be the only guy who
wants the police in spearfish,
south Dakota...

12:58.078 --> 13:03.882
To call the gruesome discoveries
of the past several weeks the
work of a serial killer?

13:03.884 --> 13:07.852
Who wants to give me a reason
why the gruesome photograph...

13:07.854 --> 13:11.022
That was found stapled to a
telephone pole...

13:11.024 --> 13:16.027
Behind the local library isn't
a photograph of the mutilated
remains...

13:16.029 --> 13:18.396
Of 23-year-old Savannah Simms...

13:18.398 --> 13:24.202
Who was reported missing some
ten days earlier from a not
so neighboring town?

13:24.204 --> 13:27.138
The nature of the mutilation
portrayed in the photograph...

13:27.140 --> 13:31.843
Made a definitive identification
impossible at this time...

13:31.845 --> 13:38.483
And so I'm asking, "why can't
it just be Savannah Simms,
just this once?"

13:38.485 --> 13:43.154
And the photograph that was
found pinned to the community
bulletin board...

13:43.156 --> 13:45.890
At the local wellborn
supermarket...

13:45.892 --> 13:48.927
Can't <i> it</i> please be of
22-year-old Janet teasley...

13:48.929 --> 13:51.162
Where do you want these
new prints?

13:51.164 --> 13:57.068
Who was reported missing 75 days
earlier from yet another not
at all neighboring town?

13:57.070 --> 14:02.173
Can't spearfish, just this once,
have a serial killer to call
our very own?

14:02.175 --> 14:04.442
I gotta see these pictures.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.444
They're like literally the only
thing that's not on the
Internet.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.413
Who do I know who can
make that happen?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.216
You read conversation-style
blogs written by people from
your hometown?

14:11.218 --> 14:14.886
I'm inspired by any nut that
takes pictures of dead people
and posts them online.

14:14.888 --> 14:17.455
I'm fucking inspired!
I'm-- I'm hard!

14:17.457 --> 14:19.557
I'm gonna be fully erect
here in a minute.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.292
Oh, for a change.
Hey! Hey!

14:21.294 --> 14:23.895
That was the mushrooms,
we talked about that.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.297
Was it?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.633
This guy knows
I'm from spearfish.

14:28.635 --> 14:35.874
He's doing this photography
thing with his victims as an
homage, as a nod, a nod to me...

14:35.876 --> 14:41.045
Spearfish's most famous citizen
and only known living artist.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.914
Frankly, I'm flattered.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.283
Didn't it say that there
isn't a serial killer?

14:45.285 --> 14:48.419
These guys are always inspired
by something, fucking copy cat.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.388
What I need is a cigarette.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.090
Chew the gum.
Fuck the gum.

14:52.092 --> 14:54.125
The gum tastes like
garlic semen.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.628
Yeah, I just feel bad
for the girls.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.998
They're getting killed
and then mutilated...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.400
And then put on display.

15:02.402 --> 15:06.037
It's fucking awful.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.974
Here we have a model who feels
something for another model...

15:09.976 --> 15:13.678
Because she's dead and mutilated
and displayed like a piece
of meat.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.346
This is news.
Shut up, asshole.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.447
Huh?

15:16.449 --> 15:18.683
I said, "shut--

15:18.685 --> 15:20.551
don't smile.

15:20.553 --> 15:22.587
How about that?
You like that?

15:22.589 --> 15:25.156
Best picture of the day, easy.
What time is it?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.658
It's uh, 6:00.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.059
6:00 in the evening, fuck me.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.595
Okay, you know what we gotta do?

15:30.597 --> 15:33.431
We're gonna call those-- those
perfume campaign people. What
the fuck is that called?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.199
The bay campaign.
The bay campaign.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.168
The bay campaign, thank you,
the bay campaign.
Stoner.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.570
Call the bay campaign people
and wake them the fuck up
and tell them...

15:39.572 --> 15:43.241
That I finally figured it out,
and I know exactly what I'm
going to do for them.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.009
I'm gonna steal this nut's idea.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.145
I'm gonna hire models pretending
to be dead people.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.713
Actually not that much
of a stretch.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.548
And you think the bay people
are gonna go for that?

15:50.550 --> 15:52.317
I told them not to hire me
in the first place...

15:52.319 --> 15:54.118
But they insisted,
so this is what they get.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.121
They get unidentifiable
dead models.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.458
We'll use those kids
from the last shoot,
trip and what's her name?

16:00.460 --> 16:02.460
What's her fucking name,
this one?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.095
Uh, Victoria.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.432
Victoria, trip and Victoria,
dead eyes on both of them.

16:07.434 --> 16:09.534
And rose here.

16:09.536 --> 16:10.969
Oh, yeah? Fuck me, huh?

16:10.971 --> 16:12.971
Yeah.
Okay, only if you're lucky.

16:12.973 --> 16:16.140
All right now, somebody please,
please, get me a fucking
cigarette...

16:16.142 --> 16:19.177
Before I kill somebody and take
their fucking picture!

16:27.320 --> 16:31.656
Well, here you go. Door-to-door
service and it's not even
bright out yet.

16:33.326 --> 16:36.127
That's gotta be worth something.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.997
I told you last night that
i didn't need you to drive me...

16:38.999 --> 16:42.000
And I told you again
an hour ago.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.235
Yeah, well, maybe you don't want
your picture in the newspaper.

16:44.237 --> 16:49.540
The story goes somewhere,
but it's about time that my face
went fucking national.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.246
Hey, come on.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.181
Look, I'm trying here.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.320
And who's that?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.689
Oh, nothing, it's just Jill.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.557
Jill, wh--

17:06.559 --> 17:09.093
anyway, I gotta go. Thanks.

17:10.597 --> 17:13.231
Maybe I'll see--

17:13.233 --> 17:16.367
yeah, well, that went great.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.846
Nice job with the minivan,
by the way, that's nice.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.748
Yeah, sorry, they didn't
have any escalades left.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.484
So, we're gonna be dead
in the pictures, right?

22:00.486 --> 22:03.054
Well, I want to have my eyes
open. Can I have my eyes open?

22:03.056 --> 22:05.523
Like, it would look so cool
if I was all like--

22:05.525 --> 22:07.825
you know?

22:07.827 --> 22:10.728
Okay, does my manager know
about this? Because I think
it's disgusting.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.830
I think it's brilliant.

22:12.832 --> 22:14.932
It's a commentary on our
fascination with death.

22:14.934 --> 22:19.603
How we let ourselves-- we think
about death just as much as we
think about sex.

22:19.605 --> 22:21.972
Well, if that's what it is,
then it's awesome.

22:21.974 --> 22:24.675
I'll tell you what it is, kids.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.913
It's that every fucker in the
country thinks they're a
photographer now, okay?

22:28.915 --> 22:31.782
And everyone can share an image,
and it's awful.

22:31.784 --> 22:36.020
It's awful, because it makes
everything just like watery
piss.

22:36.022 --> 22:40.925
Then you have this guy who
creates an image that you
actually can't fuck with.

22:40.927 --> 22:46.430
That you actually can't ignore,
and when that happens, I have
to ask myself...

22:46.432 --> 22:49.133
"Peter hemmings, what is wrong
with this picture?

22:49.135 --> 22:53.571
"Are you just going to sit there
and let this guy make you look
like a dummy...

22:53.573 --> 22:58.609
"Or are you going to steal his
idea and make a bunch of money,
and then get high?"

22:58.611 --> 23:01.445
And I think we all know the
answer to that, don't we, trip?

23:01.447 --> 23:02.847
Oh, hells yeah, man!

23:02.849 --> 23:05.416
If I catch any of you
instagramming...

23:05.418 --> 23:08.552
Or whatever the fuck it's called
on this trip, you're all fired.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.388
I couldn't be more serious.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.089
Yeah, he's not kidding.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.626
Let's have a party tonight.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.161
Yeah, man!

23:17.163 --> 23:20.164
Just a little get together,
you know, invite some locals...

23:20.166 --> 23:24.635
Barbeque some shit, some ribs,
sprinkle a little peyote
on there.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.905
Just a little get together,
just to celebrate our arrival.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.574
Cool, we'll just have to stop
in town, grab some stuff.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.910
My house has definitely
got nothing.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.179
Hey, how much longer?

23:35.181 --> 23:37.448
I have no fucking idea.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.484
It's been so long, I don't even
recognize these trees.

23:40.486 --> 23:41.952
Hey... check it out.

23:42.789 --> 23:46.023
Jesus.

23:46.025 --> 23:51.595
10,494... I've had anal sex
with more people than that.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.670
Get the fuck off me!

23:59.672 --> 24:01.906
Jesus, I'm driving.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.909
Keep fucking driving, then.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.233
Yeah, it still smells
like a wet sponge.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.035
Oh--

24:31.037 --> 24:33.604
I think this was where one
of the pictures were found.

24:33.606 --> 24:38.075
Note to Chris, call the cops
and make an appointment for me
to see those pictures.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.176
An appointment?

24:39.178 --> 24:41.078
Note to Chris #2...

24:41.080 --> 24:43.747
Get me a carton of cigarettes,
a whole pallet.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.216
I've gotta piss.

24:45.218 --> 24:46.517
That's pretty.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.219
I want to photograph this truck.

24:48.221 --> 24:50.855
Look at the color,
it's blood red.

24:50.857 --> 24:54.024
It's so spot-on that it becomes
a complete cliché...

24:54.026 --> 24:57.495
And it's such a cliché that it
comes right back around to being
perfect for me.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.864
Whoa, that's heavy, man.

24:59.866 --> 25:02.566
Get it for me, Chris...
Pretty please?

25:02.568 --> 25:04.902
Get this truck for me.
Okay, I'll leave a note.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.904
Capital idea.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.206
Ladies, why don't you just sort
of come over here and stand...

25:09.208 --> 25:11.942
Kind of lean maybe, on the--
on the hood.

25:11.944 --> 25:14.078
Ready?
I don't know if we should
be leaning on the truck, guys.

25:14.080 --> 25:16.747
Chris, unclench, unclench.
I know it's not--

25:18.150 --> 25:20.084
I love it.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.151
Here.

26:12.638 --> 26:16.674
Okay, the only thing you
really need to know about me...

26:16.676 --> 26:19.343
Is that Tequila makes me
want to fight...

26:19.345 --> 26:22.780
And cheap wine makes me
want to fuck.

26:22.782 --> 26:27.685
I'm sure the lives of many brave
young men were lost...

26:27.687 --> 26:30.955
In the refinement of that
elegant theorem.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.624
I love you.
Oh.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.705
Find everything you were
looking for today?

26:47.707 --> 26:50.808
Uh, yeah, yeah, we did.
Thank you.

27:03.656 --> 27:07.825
You remember all the numbers...
For the codes and stuff?

27:07.827 --> 27:11.362
Oh, yeah, the scanner's been
broken long enough, so...
Kind of have to.

27:11.364 --> 27:12.896
Oh, yeah--

27:12.898 --> 27:15.399
makes it really hard to fall
asleep sometimes.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.001
Can't really stop it.

27:17.003 --> 27:20.070
Yeah, I actually just read
in the new yorker...

27:20.072 --> 27:22.272
It's called the Tetris effect.

27:22.274 --> 27:25.275
It's when you do something over
and over again, it kind of gets
stuck in there.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.144
You can't shut it off, you know?

27:27.146 --> 27:30.948
Hm, you know, I had a real
Tetris problem in the 7th grade.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.283
It was really, really bad.

27:33.285 --> 27:36.253
Yeah, I did-- I did, too,
actually.

27:36.255 --> 27:39.289
I think everyone did,
it's kind of-- it's a good game.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.091
It's... Tetris.

27:43.062 --> 27:45.763
So, are you guys
from Minneapolis?

27:45.765 --> 27:48.732
Uh, no, la, actually,
Los Angeles.

27:48.734 --> 27:50.701
What happened?
Did your plane crash?

27:50.703 --> 27:52.403
Yeah, we were gonna resort
to cannibalism...

27:52.405 --> 27:56.073
And then we found this place,
so we didn't have to do that.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.876
No, we're here
for a photo shoot.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.944
It's actually an ad campaign.
It's--

28:00.946 --> 28:04.281
Peter hemmings is shooting it.
I'm sure you've heard of him.

28:04.283 --> 28:05.949
I haven't.

28:05.951 --> 28:08.285
I'm surprised. I thought
everyone from here knew him.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.087
He's also from here.

28:10.089 --> 28:14.391
Is it that man over there
staring at me? Is that him?

28:14.393 --> 28:17.261
Yeah.

28:17.263 --> 28:18.462
It's very much my boss.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.064
How's it going?
Good, fine.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.699
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.741
Hello.

28:30.743 --> 28:33.444
I was pretending
not to see you there.

28:33.446 --> 28:37.181
We're just sort of doing
an exposé on the local scene
down here.

28:37.183 --> 28:42.152
You know, sort of kicking
around some rocks and seeing
what scatters.

28:42.154 --> 28:46.090
Exposé is a French word
for naked, by the way.

28:48.728 --> 28:51.195
It's okay, I get it.

28:51.197 --> 28:53.831
Just because you're from here
doesn't mean that you're
a local.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.902
Tell her I want to take her
picture, Chris.

28:58.904 --> 29:03.207
Actually, tell her that we're
having people over at this house
that we're staying at.

29:03.209 --> 29:06.176
And tell her everyone knows it
is the cabin on the lake road.

29:06.178 --> 29:09.947
But tell her it's actually more
like a house. You'll make it
sound cute.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.081
Okay.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.784
Tell her she can bring whoever.

29:13.786 --> 29:17.421
She'll understand that you mean
her boyfriend, just so it seems
like you're cool with that.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.290
Yeah, I'll tell her
all those things, yeah.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.761
Tell her she's beautiful.
Give her a card.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.300
Okay, well--

29:30.302 --> 29:33.971
you obviously heard the man,
uh--

29:33.973 --> 29:36.974
yeah, I did.

29:36.976 --> 29:40.844
So anything else today?
No, that will do it, thank you.

29:40.846 --> 29:44.915
All right, that brings
your total to $328 and 71 cents.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.383
Put it on there, please.

29:50.356 --> 29:53.390
Are you guys seriously
gonna drink all this?

29:53.392 --> 29:55.259
Hell's yeah, man.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.240
There's my kitty.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.114
Hello?

32:39.491 --> 32:41.091
Here, kitty, kit--

32:45.164 --> 32:47.230
that's not very nice.

32:49.468 --> 32:54.538
I see why you're Colleen's
friend, you're very pretty.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.473
And I brought you a gift.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.718
No!

33:15.561 --> 33:18.195
It's okay.

33:21.533 --> 33:23.333
Got dinner!

33:28.340 --> 33:32.576
It's okay... ssh.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.481
Mm.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.050
Smells delicious.

33:49.228 --> 33:50.794
Eat up, pussy.

33:53.766 --> 33:58.268
That's not a very good kitty...
Is it?

34:03.809 --> 34:06.276
It's okay.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.778
Come on, it's--

34:11.183 --> 34:12.716
come on.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.719
Look what else I got.

34:23.295 --> 34:27.364
Now I bet you were always
the girl that never took a bad
picture, huh?

34:47.518 --> 34:50.754
Yeah, I bet that was you.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.295
Should we call someone?

34:58.297 --> 35:00.330
Do you want your phone?
You can call someone.

35:01.300 --> 35:04.101
Who do we have here?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.469
Colleen.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.538
She's probably busy at work.

35:08.540 --> 35:13.343
There's Kelly, there's... mom.

35:13.345 --> 35:17.747
I'll let you call mom.
Mom's always know what to do.

35:17.749 --> 35:22.352
You call mom and all this
will be over, yeah?

35:23.689 --> 35:25.522
All right, let's call mommy.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.126
Here you go.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.661
Go on, take it.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.564
<i> Hello, you've reached</i>
<i> maryanne o'meara...</i>

35:34.566 --> 35:36.867
<i> Please leave a message</i>
<i> after the beep.</i>

35:36.869 --> 35:39.436
Mom, come get me out!

35:40.739 --> 35:42.739
Mom! Mom!

37:04.523 --> 37:08.291
<i> Jill</i> <i> hey, it's Jill, still stuck</i> <i> in hell.
You know what to do.</i>

37:08.293 --> 37:12.829
Hey, it's me. I just wanted to
call and see where you are.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.966
I don't think I missed
a call from you today...

37:15.968 --> 37:19.869
But... blah-- anyway,
call me back.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.463
This is like the
playboy mansion.

38:20.465 --> 38:24.801
Well, that's what happens
when you cast in a grocery store
in fucking south Dakota.

38:26.438 --> 38:30.573
And there were obviously
no dudes at the store.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.842
All girls?

38:32.844 --> 38:35.345
You couldn't have one sausage
for momma?

38:35.347 --> 38:37.347
Are you gonna take pictures
of all these girls?

38:37.349 --> 38:38.348
Unfortunately.

38:38.350 --> 38:39.916
They're terrible.

38:39.918 --> 38:41.985
I understand.

38:41.987 --> 38:45.021
Why couldn't the killer have
just killed one of them?

38:49.561 --> 38:51.828
I'd fucking best let Johnny
fuck that snake.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.863
If it was necessary, why not?

38:53.865 --> 38:55.598
What the fuck
is he talking about?
You know, bring it on.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.967
Yeah, I know, dickhead,
squeeze and wad and shit.

38:57.969 --> 39:01.738
But if you think about it,
it's like they don't even
have any fucking arms!

39:01.740 --> 39:04.007
The sad part
is he's gonna get laid.

39:04.009 --> 39:05.809
I hope so.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.947
What's up?

39:56.762 --> 39:58.628
Great.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.101
Okay, come here.
Here you go.

40:05.103 --> 40:08.705
Just stand right there, and you
come and stand right here.

40:08.707 --> 40:10.807
You-- no, no, you.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.012
Okay.

40:19.484 --> 40:23.153
I'm just waiting, um, you know,
for that moment...

40:23.155 --> 40:27.123
Where things go from being
completely fucking awful,
like now...

40:27.125 --> 40:29.492
To coming back around
to being really good.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.628
So it shouldn't be
that much longer.

40:39.538 --> 40:41.805
And one, two... look at me.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.008
Very good, get closer.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.677
Jesus, are you guys
in junior high?

40:49.548 --> 40:51.781
What am I doing here?

40:56.855 --> 40:58.655
Get closer to each other,
come on.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.156
Closer, closer, closer, closer.

41:00.158 --> 41:02.225
Get inside of each other,
go ahead.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.160
Fucking yeah, yeah.

41:06.097 --> 41:07.130
Great.

41:24.182 --> 41:26.583
My god, okay.
Switch passing thumbs.

41:30.789 --> 41:34.591
If it's any more local girls,
just tell them we're sold out.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.629
You guys want some chips?

41:39.631 --> 41:43.600
Hey, models don't eat... ever.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.003
That was so mean, do it again.

41:47.939 --> 41:49.706
Hi.
Hey.

41:49.708 --> 41:52.609
Wow, you actually made it, um--

41:52.611 --> 41:55.745
yeah, is-- did I show up
too late?

41:55.747 --> 41:58.281
No, no, not at all,
it's awesome that you came.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.782
Come in.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.687
I'm sorry I'm late.

42:04.689 --> 42:08.658
I was supposed to meet
a friend here and I guess
she's still at work.

42:08.660 --> 42:11.027
No, that's fine.
Here, come on, we're in here.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.896
This is so much better
when you look away.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.063
I mean it.

42:24.976 --> 42:30.246
Petty resentments
of the local girl.

42:30.248 --> 42:35.251
Oh, wow, it looks so appealing,
all the drinks that no one's
bothered to consume yet.

42:35.253 --> 42:36.953
Yeah.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.556
Actually... there might be
something to it.

42:39.558 --> 42:41.624
What are you talking about?

42:41.626 --> 42:45.828
Yeah, I don't know, I don't even
know what I'm really doing here.

42:45.830 --> 42:49.198
Hey, pretty lady.

42:57.742 --> 43:02.278
I'm so sorry, should I perhaps
ask for permission...

43:02.280 --> 43:04.247
To take your photograph?

43:04.249 --> 43:08.585
Permission is such a shit word,
there's nothing sexy about it.

43:08.587 --> 43:10.887
You know, in my line of work,
we don't ask for permission.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.089
Nobody talks to each other
about permission.

43:13.091 --> 43:16.059
What we talk about is release,
that's what we give each other.

43:16.061 --> 43:18.328
Colleen... Peter.

43:18.330 --> 43:20.196
Yeah, I remember.

43:20.198 --> 43:21.898
Whoa! Okay, all right.

43:21.900 --> 43:24.634
Didn't that feel so much better?
Okay, there you go.

43:24.636 --> 43:26.936
It's the release, isn't it?

43:26.938 --> 43:29.005
It just feels like you can get
all of that tightness...

43:29.007 --> 43:31.040
That's inside of you
and just let it go.

43:31.042 --> 43:33.142
Whoa.
Oh, whoa?

43:33.144 --> 43:35.244
Yeah, whoa, I don't really
like my photo being taken.

43:35.246 --> 43:38.047
Wh-- wh-- I don't like my photo
being taken? Why not?

43:38.049 --> 43:41.718
What if I wanted to capture a
photograph of you?

43:41.720 --> 43:43.386
You're being incredibly selfish,
don't you think?

43:43.388 --> 43:46.055
I think you should just
give her a second.

43:46.057 --> 43:48.791
I'm so sorry, you're right.
I should at least wait until you
have a drink inside of you...

43:48.793 --> 43:49.993
Shouldn't I?
Yes.

43:49.995 --> 43:52.028
Okay, please stop.

43:52.030 --> 43:53.796
And if you touch the head
like that, you're just gonna
make it come.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.898
Come on, baby, just release!

43:55.900 --> 43:57.867
Just back the fuck up!
Oh!

43:57.869 --> 44:00.336
What the fuck, bitch?
No, no, no, no.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.972
Easy for a second... you okay?

44:07.178 --> 44:08.878
Colleen, wait up!

44:16.054 --> 44:18.254
Hey, Colleen!

44:20.091 --> 44:21.991
Are you okay?

44:21.993 --> 44:24.827
Yeah, it takes a whole lot more
than that to make me not okay.

44:24.829 --> 44:27.330
Yeah, um, Peter, he's--
he's kind of a--

44:27.332 --> 44:29.032
yeah, I know he is.
Yeah.

44:29.034 --> 44:31.868
Well, if you come back in,
I'll-- I could talk to him.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.303
Yeah, I have work tomorrow and i
don't know where my friend is...

44:34.305 --> 44:35.838
Who was supposed to meet me
here, so--

44:35.840 --> 44:38.274
okay, well, I'm sorry.

44:38.276 --> 44:41.144
You're sorry? For what?

44:41.146 --> 44:46.749
Um, I'm sorry--
I'm sorry for Peter.

44:46.751 --> 44:49.919
It's kind of my job
to be sorry for him.

44:49.921 --> 44:52.822
Well, he's Peter hemmings
or whoever...

44:52.824 --> 44:57.460
So I'm sure he doesn't travel
anywhere without his trusty
team of apologists.

44:57.462 --> 45:00.096
Right.
Yeah, I know, not your fault.

45:00.098 --> 45:04.033
Yeah, um, you get service
out here?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.835
No, I don't.

45:05.837 --> 45:07.837
Yeah, shit, me neither,
fucking at&t.

45:07.839 --> 45:10.406
Hey, uh, I hate to tell
you this..

45:10.408 --> 45:15.278
But what you did in there
is just gonna-- it's just gonna
make him like you more.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.947
Yeah, but it was
totally worth it.

45:17.949 --> 45:20.183
Yeah.

46:05.196 --> 46:09.332
Are you cold?
Mm... yeah, a little.

46:09.334 --> 46:14.904
Hey, uh, excuse me, can we get
one of those cot blanket things?

46:14.906 --> 46:19.275
Having seen some movies,
I'm pretty sure the guy
didn't leave any fingerprints...

46:19.277 --> 46:23.146
Unless he wanted you to find
them, in which case it becomes
this whole labyrinth-themed...

46:23.148 --> 46:25.948
Thing and I'm really not sure
you're ready for that, officer.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.117
Well, we have to do everybody...

46:28.119 --> 46:30.920
Just in case, just so we can
tell theirs from yours.

46:30.922 --> 46:34.824
Oh, yeah, I get it. I mean, you
know, you might want to just
check her prints...

46:34.826 --> 46:37.493
Since she's the one
who touches her own car.

46:37.495 --> 46:39.295
Oh, we already have hers
in the file.

46:39.297 --> 46:42.064
You know, from when she found
the other photos?

46:43.902 --> 46:47.470
She found the other pictures
that the guy left.

46:47.472 --> 46:51.140
Of course!
Hey, it's cool, man.

46:51.142 --> 46:54.010
I'm not gonna throw you
under the bus, deputy.

46:54.012 --> 46:56.445
I understand that you're
upset. I can see that.

46:56.447 --> 47:00.216
But from where I'm looking
at things, nothing happened.

47:00.218 --> 47:02.018
And you're okay.

47:02.020 --> 47:04.086
Somebody followed me here...

47:04.088 --> 47:06.856
So he could put that picture
in a place where I would be
the one to find it.

47:06.858 --> 47:09.192
And we are gonna look into that.

47:09.194 --> 47:12.829
I know this is scary,
and we're doing the best
we can to figure this out.

47:12.831 --> 47:16.999
And until that happens, I'll
have Daniels escort you home
and follow you in his cruiser.

47:17.001 --> 47:19.368
Don't even bother.

47:22.240 --> 47:24.273
Colleen, hey!

47:24.275 --> 47:25.875
Are you sure you're gonna
be all right?

47:25.877 --> 47:28.311
Haven't you heard?
I'll be fine.

48:20.064 --> 48:21.464
Oh, shit.

48:46.391 --> 48:49.358
You know, I called you
a bunch of times.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.394
You guys have fun, you and Jill?

48:51.396 --> 48:53.629
I'm tired, okay?

48:53.631 --> 48:55.932
You're all tired out,
because it's special shit
all of a sudden?

48:55.934 --> 49:00.069
Pretty townie chick,
out and about.

49:00.071 --> 49:01.938
I don't want to do this tonight.

49:01.940 --> 49:06.642
Yeah, what, 'cause you already
did some of that la fag?

49:06.644 --> 49:07.710
What?

49:07.712 --> 49:09.712
What?

49:09.714 --> 49:11.147
What are you gonna
make him your star?

49:11.149 --> 49:13.549
Wait, did you talk
to Jill tonight?

49:13.551 --> 49:17.186
Jill? No, why the fuck would
i want to talk to Jill, what,
so she can lie to me, too?

49:17.188 --> 49:19.422
How did you know where I was?

49:19.424 --> 49:22.591
How do I know that you
fucking lied to me?
And went solo to a party?

49:22.593 --> 49:24.160
What the fuck is wrong with you?

49:24.162 --> 49:26.362
Did you follow me?
What are you talking about?

49:26.364 --> 49:28.698
Did you put those pictures in
places where I could find them?

49:28.700 --> 49:32.101
Pictures? Is that what
you're going on about again,
those fucking pictures?

49:32.103 --> 49:35.137
Yes! The one at the store,
and the library, and tonight!
Did you?

49:35.139 --> 49:36.205
Don't be fucking stupid.

49:36.207 --> 49:38.207
How did you know where I was?

49:38.209 --> 49:41.310
Colleen?
Just say it was you, so i
can do something about it!

49:41.312 --> 49:44.013
Beth randle fucking texted me
when you got there, all right?

49:44.015 --> 49:46.349
What is wrong with you?
Just--

49:48.519 --> 49:52.088
you know, you think everything's
about you, don't you?

49:52.090 --> 49:54.156
But it's not.

49:54.158 --> 49:58.661
See, I see you, Colleen.

49:58.663 --> 50:02.131
No, you don't.
Now I need you to leave.

50:34.399 --> 50:36.098
What the fuck?

50:47.278 --> 50:48.677
Finally.

51:42.800 --> 51:45.267
Ben?

51:55.213 --> 51:57.646
You forgot your wallet, asshole.

53:16.594 --> 53:19.562
Ah, smells like you're smoking.

53:19.564 --> 53:22.665
We've moved past that, Chris.

53:22.667 --> 53:26.235
We've fucking moved on
to bigger things.

53:26.237 --> 53:30.906
This girl has found all
of the photographs so far.

53:30.908 --> 53:34.944
As far as I can tell, any time
this guy wants somebody to find
the photos, she does.

53:34.946 --> 53:37.613
Coincidence? I don't think so.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.315
Yeah, well that seems
pretty obvious, yeah?

53:39.317 --> 53:42.284
So why her?
I mean, if I'm the cops...

53:42.286 --> 53:43.786
That's what I'm doing, right?

53:43.788 --> 53:45.654
Yeah, I don't think that
they're doing anything.

53:45.656 --> 53:48.390
It's that whole Dr. Lecter
thing, and what do we covet?

53:48.392 --> 53:50.593
We covet what we see every day.

53:50.595 --> 53:53.662
Yeah, well, she's the check-out
girl. Everyone sees her
every day.

53:53.664 --> 53:56.865
But somebody sees her
differently than everybody else.

53:56.867 --> 54:00.636
To somebody... she's a star.

54:00.638 --> 54:03.839
If I'm the police,
that's what I'm doing.

54:03.841 --> 54:06.008
But fuck the police!
I'm not the police!

54:06.010 --> 54:08.244
I'm a fucking artist!

54:08.246 --> 54:12.281
And it's a very fine line
that separates me from our
sick-fuck friend.

54:12.283 --> 54:14.817
He probably has a PC.

54:19.523 --> 54:23.959
Maybe I'm the one
who's becoming obsolete.

54:23.961 --> 54:29.732
Maybe I'm the PC
in this relationship.

54:29.734 --> 54:34.536
Maybe this guy... is a Mac.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.906
I don't want any other girls,
i want this girl.

54:37.908 --> 54:39.475
I don't want anyone else.

54:39.477 --> 54:42.711
For what?
For the big campaign, just her.

54:42.713 --> 54:44.713
Well, what about the whole
"dead models" thing?

54:44.715 --> 54:46.649
It's been done. We take Colleen
out of this shithole...

54:46.651 --> 54:49.051
And shoot her at the studio
in la, that's it.

54:49.053 --> 54:52.921
Why the fuck are we here?
Use rose or Vic, why does it
absolutely have to be Colleen?

54:52.923 --> 54:55.557
So that he can't have her.

54:55.559 --> 55:01.530
Nobody makes me feel obsolete.
Nobody makes me feel like
a fucking Dell computer...

55:01.532 --> 55:02.965
And gets away with it.

55:06.437 --> 55:08.937
I want this girl.

55:08.939 --> 55:12.808
And by the way, you do, too.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.010
So get in line.

55:15.012 --> 55:19.381
<i>It's just something</i>
<i>I have to do.</i>

55:21.319 --> 55:24.887
I can't stay in this town,
it's a lot of stuff.

55:24.889 --> 55:27.523
Well, you certainly were
a bright spot.

55:27.525 --> 55:29.792
Not here long enough for us
to get to know you, Colleen...

55:29.794 --> 55:32.961
But a bright spot all the same,
everybody sure likes you a lot.

55:34.432 --> 55:36.332
You know where you're goin'?

55:36.334 --> 55:38.901
Not like I haven't figured
it out before.

55:38.903 --> 55:42.504
All right, your total
will be $14.93.

55:57.455 --> 55:59.621
How's it going, Colleen?

55:59.623 --> 56:02.658
Oh, good, you know, slow.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.626
It's tom.

56:04.628 --> 56:07.796
Yeah, I know, sorry, I can't
seem to really wake up today.

56:07.798 --> 56:10.032
Long night?

56:10.034 --> 56:13.035
No, not really.

56:13.037 --> 56:16.004
Oh, thank you, let me help you
there with that.

56:16.006 --> 56:19.775
Thank you. Have a nice day!

56:19.777 --> 56:22.644
Got any big plans
for the weekend?

56:22.646 --> 56:25.481
Uh, probably, I'll just sleep.

56:25.483 --> 56:27.149
That's not much fun.

56:27.151 --> 56:29.585
Yeah, you're right about that.

56:29.587 --> 56:34.089
Prettiest girl in town--
just goin' through a day
until it's all over?

56:34.091 --> 56:36.859
It seems like a terrible waste,
if you want to ask me.

56:38.529 --> 56:41.897
Hey, it's none of my business.

56:41.899 --> 56:44.433
You know, I'm not really
supposed to say this...

56:44.435 --> 56:46.869
But you can buy a whole case
of these things at big lots.

56:46.871 --> 56:49.671
Costs about half as much.

56:49.673 --> 56:55.511
You know, the truth is I'm not
sure my cat's gonna live much
longer, so I'd hate to waste it.

56:55.513 --> 56:59.081
Oh, I'm really sorry
to hear that.

57:01.685 --> 57:03.552
Anything else today?

57:03.554 --> 57:05.087
No, that's it for me.

57:05.089 --> 57:08.056
All right, your total
will be $1.09.

57:10.728 --> 57:13.195
Cool... and let me
give you a penny.

57:15.065 --> 57:18.000
There you go.
I'll be seeing you next time,
Colleen.

57:20.738 --> 57:22.704
Hey.
Hey.

57:22.706 --> 57:25.541
Ah, you think that we
could talk for a second?

57:44.562 --> 57:47.963
You know, she sometimes does
her hair up like that?

57:47.965 --> 57:51.166
It drives me fucking crazy.

57:59.143 --> 58:02.744
Do you really think
this is a good idea?

58:02.746 --> 58:06.014
No, we can leave her
here to die--

58:06.016 --> 58:10.219
hey, so, Chris here thinks
that I should apologize...

58:10.221 --> 58:12.588
For taking your picture...

58:12.590 --> 58:15.824
Or something, I don't--
i was only pretending
to pay attention.

58:15.826 --> 58:17.526
Why?

58:17.528 --> 58:19.661
Because even when
I'm a complete shit...

58:19.663 --> 58:22.231
I am still a much better option.

58:22.233 --> 58:24.933
You stay here and god
only knows how many times...

58:24.935 --> 58:29.004
That guy tries to show you
his nasty, nasty pictures.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.573
That's the best case scenario.

58:31.575 --> 58:33.175
The worst case scenario...

58:33.177 --> 58:38.013
Is that you end up <i> in</i> one
of those nasty, nasty pictures.

58:38.015 --> 58:41.083
Or you come out to la with me...

58:41.085 --> 58:44.753
And make dirty pictures
for me for a little
walking-around money.

58:44.755 --> 58:48.156
You don't have to sleep with me.
You can if you want to, but it's
not a requirement.

58:48.158 --> 58:50.025
I don't give a shit. You can
stay in my guest house.

58:50.027 --> 58:51.793
I've never even seen
inside the place.

58:51.795 --> 58:53.629
It's actually-- it's pretty
nice in there.

58:53.631 --> 58:54.897
Well, yeah, shit!

58:54.899 --> 58:57.099
Look, I'm just trying to help
you, okay?

58:57.101 --> 59:00.836
It's not like the guy is going
to follow you back to la,
all right?

59:00.838 --> 59:03.972
That would be like a shark
eating a bunch of people...

59:03.974 --> 59:07.676
And then getting on a plane,
and getting off at the other end
of the country...

59:07.678 --> 59:09.978
And then eating more people.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.915
I mean, serial killers don't
board airplanes, they don't
go on trips.

59:12.917 --> 59:14.149
Serial killers don't
have wallets.

59:14.151 --> 59:16.552
No one's saying that there's--

59:16.554 --> 59:18.053
that there's what, a serial
killer? What should I call
this person?

59:18.055 --> 59:21.223
A man with a plan?
A very dedicated individual?

59:21.225 --> 59:22.591
Why me?

59:22.593 --> 59:25.294
Does it matter?
Yes, it does!

59:25.296 --> 59:28.764
Will somebody please explain
to me why it's such a goddamn
chore to be chosen?

59:28.766 --> 59:32.067
You think this is some sort
of joke, don't you?

59:32.069 --> 59:34.803
It's not so great to be noticed,
you know?

59:34.805 --> 59:37.072
It's one thing to be picked out
by some fancy photographer...

59:37.074 --> 59:39.241
But what if it's just some
random stranger...

59:39.243 --> 59:41.009
Some guy on the street?

59:41.011 --> 59:43.679
That sort of thing
doesn't end very well.

59:43.681 --> 59:49.017
I heard...
But you know, this--

59:49.019 --> 59:51.753
this doesn't end very well,
either.

59:51.755 --> 59:54.856
You still haven't answered
my question.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.595
I chose you...

59:59.597 --> 01:00:03.198
Because I haven't had
a fresh idea...

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.734
In a long, long time.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:09.805
Because I feel old... and tired.

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:15.010
And you are neither.

01:00:15.012 --> 01:00:21.016
Honestly, I've never heard him
say anything like that, ever.

01:00:22.786 --> 01:00:24.620
Fine.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.658
When?
When? Tonight, now.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:32.194
Tonight we have a slumber party.

01:00:32.196 --> 01:00:35.097
A safety-in-numbers
slumber party.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:40.168
And tomorrow, we get on the
first flight we can back to la.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:46.708
I mean, you weren't really
planning on living here,
were you?

01:00:50.714 --> 01:00:53.181
Someone has to come with me
to my place, so I can get
some stuff.

01:00:53.183 --> 01:00:55.784
Chris volunteers his services.

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.319
Yeah.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.222
Watch out for Chris here.

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:03.091
Scientology turned him straight.

01:01:09.266 --> 01:01:10.899
So I'm just-- I'm curious...

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:13.235
What made you say "yes"
back there?

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:17.139
'Cause I'm pretty sure
i can handle myself.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:24.880
Okay, good, he's not here.
Who?

01:01:24.882 --> 01:01:27.916
Um, my boyfriend.

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:30.786
Oh... cool, yeah.

01:01:32.823 --> 01:01:35.290
My ex-boyfriend.

01:01:36.427 --> 01:01:39.094
Okay, cool.

01:01:39.096 --> 01:01:43.098
Hey, can you do me a big favor?
If you see a black truck,
just make sure you honk twice.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:46.968
A black truck? Am I on like
the lookout here, or I mean,
is it--

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:49.705
really? Yeah.
Is he big?

01:01:49.707 --> 01:01:52.774
Yeah, he's pretty big, but don't
worry, he's a fucking pussy.

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:56.111
Anyway, I'll just be
two seconds.
All right, I'll just--

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:57.713
don't worry.

01:01:59.149 --> 01:02:01.717
I'll just hang out here.

01:02:02.953 --> 01:02:06.788
A black truck... shit.

01:03:23.367 --> 01:03:26.434
How's Colleen?

01:03:26.436 --> 01:03:29.204
You know, you could have
treated her like a star.

01:03:29.206 --> 01:03:32.174
Fuck you!

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:38.547
The thing is, I can't really
understand what you're saying.

01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:41.149
Your mouth just sounds
like a dirty cunt.

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:44.586
Should we ask Gerry what he
thinks about you?

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:46.988
Pussy!

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:03.071
Do you like what you see,
faggot?

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:04.472
I'll fucking kill you.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:11.913
No... I don't think you will.

01:04:16.954 --> 01:04:22.157
In an hour, your body is gonna
be in two separate trash bags.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:28.563
You should have treated
her better.

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:32.434
Fuck you.

01:04:58.028 --> 01:05:00.161
What?

01:05:00.163 --> 01:05:04.399
I don't know, you,
you're angrily packing...

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:07.969
Like the girl in a movie
who is angrily packing...

01:05:07.971 --> 01:05:09.671
Because she's leaving the guy.

01:05:09.673 --> 01:05:13.575
But in reality, we all
leaving at the same time...

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:18.947
And we're all going to the same
place, and I think that's
incredibly funny.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.954
What's wrong?

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:27.555
You know exactly what's wrong.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:29.624
Okay, remind me.

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:34.062
You like that white trash bitch
better than you like me...

01:05:34.064 --> 01:05:38.166
And it is fucking dumb.

01:05:38.168 --> 01:05:40.068
Colleen?
Yeah.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:41.970
I haven't even tried her, yet.

01:05:41.972 --> 01:05:43.972
Jesus fucking Christ, Peter!

01:05:43.974 --> 01:05:47.709
Can't you be serious with me
for one goddamn second?

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:50.278
One!

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.579
Hey, come here.
No.

01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:53.415
Come here, eh!
No, fuck you.

01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:56.284
Come on, come here!
I'm sorry, okay? Come here.

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.553
Come sit with me.
Come here.

01:05:58.555 --> 01:06:00.422
Come on.

01:06:00.424 --> 01:06:01.723
Where are you gonna go?
You're not gonna go anywhere.

01:06:01.725 --> 01:06:05.193
Come here. There you go!
Come on.

01:06:07.597 --> 01:06:10.165
Don't fucking patronize me.

01:06:10.167 --> 01:06:11.967
You know what that word means,
sweetie?

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.703
Fuckin--
come here.

01:06:16.039 --> 01:06:17.439
There you go.

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:19.674
I hate you sometimes.

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:24.112
I hate you so much
some times, too.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:26.581
I'm sorry, okay,
I'm sorry, you're right.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:29.250
I do like her more than you.

01:06:29.252 --> 01:06:31.252
Motherfucker!

01:06:34.257 --> 01:06:35.590
Ow!
Huh?

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:37.325
I sat on something hard,
hang on.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.593
Do you need me to get up?
No, no, no, stay right there.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.628
Okay.
Ow, what is this?

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.999
Oh, look...

01:06:44.001 --> 01:06:48.536
It's a very, very,
cheap bottle of wine.

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:52.540
And how the fuck
did that get there?

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:58.646
A little birdie told me that
when you drink cheap wine...

01:06:58.648 --> 01:07:02.550
It makes you want to fuck.

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:04.619
See?
Mm.

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:08.490
When you talk, I listen.

01:07:14.331 --> 01:07:18.066
Aren't you so fucking sweet.

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:07.215
Whoa! This place is really nice.

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:09.651
Yeah, yeah, I found it online.

01:08:09.653 --> 01:08:14.155
It's just a rental, but yeah,
it's definitely really nice.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:21.529
You know, I'm just gonna--
I'm gonna sleep on the couch
downstairs.

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:23.798
It's-- it's okay,
it's just for tonight.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.167
No, it's-- it's fine.

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:29.636
Uh, yeah, yeah, totally, um--

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:32.506
let me just get this crap
out of the way.

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.142
All right.

01:08:34.144 --> 01:08:37.377
Hey.
Hello.

01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:38.479
Yeah.

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.587
Yeah... almost.
Are you okay?

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.221
There, could you just
roll some more?

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:49.323
Where? This-- this way?
Yeah.

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:51.693
Mm-hm.
All right?

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:55.296
Good now.
Okay, then good, yeah?

01:08:56.765 --> 01:09:01.269
Yeah, oh yeah, baby,
just like that!

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.505
Jesus, I look pissed.

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:06.174
Well, weren't you pissed?

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:09.210
Yes... I guess the camera
never lies.

01:09:09.212 --> 01:09:11.279
Yeah, actually it always lies.

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:14.282
Once you take a photo
of something, it's no longer
the truth...

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.783
It's just kind of like
a version of the truth...

01:09:15.785 --> 01:09:18.185
Which is basically
like saying it's a lie.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.457
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:25.193
Did it work?
No.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.361
Okay.

01:09:26.363 --> 01:09:27.929
So, you like what you see?

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.264
Oh, you look amazing.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:32.567
Mm, oh... I know.

01:09:33.737 --> 01:09:37.372
So don't ask me to--
mm.

01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:40.675
I shouldn't even be showing you
these. Peter never lets anyone
see an unedited batch...

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.676
Especially not the model.

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.246
Is that what I am now?

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:48.383
Uh, well, if you're gonna
get paid to have Peter hemmings
take your photo...

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:50.518
Then yeah, people are gonna
start to call you that.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.353
It could be worse.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:55.590
Okay, I guess I just don't like
the idea of living off of my--

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:57.425
your looks?
Yeah.

01:09:57.427 --> 01:10:02.497
I guess that any girl who thinks
it's enough to be pretty is--

01:10:02.499 --> 01:10:05.200
yeah, I don't know
what you would call that.

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.936
I'm pretty sure it's called
a model.

01:10:07.938 --> 01:10:09.237
I think.
Yeah.

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:10.672
Yeah.
A model, Jesus--

01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:14.409
well, what else do you want
to do?

01:10:15.679 --> 01:10:18.213
Nothing, never mind.

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:21.382
That's a whole different
conversation for some
other time.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:25.887
So, am I gonna get to talk
to you another time?

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.756
I got time.

01:10:30.594 --> 01:10:33.528
Whoa! Who's-- who's Kelly?

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:36.864
Uh, Kelly's a--
she's just a friend.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:41.903
She must be a really good
friend, she has her own
album thing.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:44.772
Uh, yeah, she does, doesn't she?

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:49.510
Um, last time I checked,
she changed her relationship
status, so--

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:53.281
okay, I get it,
that makes it official.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:55.383
I'm single now.

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:59.954
Oh, yeah! Fuck me!
Fuck me like a puppy!

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:03.424
Oh! Mm! Yes, yes!

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:07.929
Deeper, harder, harder!

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:10.431
They uh--
uh--

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:13.334
yeah, I'm gonna shut the door.
I don't think we should
listen to that.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:15.870
It's fine, we're both adults,
right?

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:21.809
Yeah, yeah, totally, um--

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:23.444
I'm still gonna shut it, though.

01:11:37.794 --> 01:11:41.329
That's the spirit!
Fuckin' dumb-dumbs.

01:11:46.036 --> 01:11:49.671
Did she just say,
"fuck me like a walrus?"

01:11:49.673 --> 01:11:52.707
I knew that girl had
body issues.

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:54.742
You want some?

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:57.912
No, it's the fucking local shit,
it's horrible.

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:59.681
Whatever.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:04.786
Let's go drown in the hot tub.

01:12:06.356 --> 01:12:08.022
Right now?
Yeah.

01:12:11.061 --> 01:12:14.762
No! Do not bring
your fucking camera!

01:12:22.806 --> 01:12:26.574
Hey, hey? What are you doing?

01:12:26.576 --> 01:12:29.744
Uh--
no, come on, it's hot tub time.

01:12:29.746 --> 01:12:31.412
All right. Yeah.
Okay?

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:33.081
It's the hot tub time.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:47.762
You sound like a duck
who got run over.

01:12:47.764 --> 01:12:51.999
Actually you sound like a
grandfather clock jerking off.

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:55.002
Oh, well, you look like a
grandfather when you jerk off.

01:13:19.095 --> 01:13:22.163
Fucking perfect.

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:30.638
Yeah.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.174
Wait, don't you need
to use a flash?

01:13:33.176 --> 01:13:36.544
Hey, I'm the professional,
all right?

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.913
Okay... right.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.716
The fucking flash here.

01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:45.420
Did it go off?

01:13:46.890 --> 01:13:50.958
Turn around
a little bit. Oh, yeah.

01:14:03.139 --> 01:14:07.708
Yeah, stay like that.
Come on, show me your pussy.

01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:10.044
Okay, can you stop?

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:13.848
One more.

01:14:29.632 --> 01:14:30.932
What are you doing?

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:43.611
Peter!

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:47.882
Where are you?

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:55.857
Are you coming in?

01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.062
Hey! There you are.

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:04.765
Hey.

01:15:05.902 --> 01:15:07.902
Where'd you-- hey!

01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:10.938
Jesus, man!

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.674
Peter! Knock it off!
Hey!

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:18.579
You're hurting my eyes, Peter.
Jesus!

01:15:18.581 --> 01:15:23.818
I just wanted to spend one
night, one night like
a regular couple.

01:15:25.955 --> 01:15:27.722
Peter!

01:15:31.294 --> 01:15:32.660
Peter?

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:08.663
Don't even tell me
you have service, because
I'll lose my shit.

01:16:08.665 --> 01:16:11.098
No, I have nothing,
but I have to make a call.

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:14.769
Okay, there's a landline in the
kitchen, if it doesn't work.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:17.138
Thanks.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.973
Yeah.

01:16:38.127 --> 01:16:41.829
<i> Hey, it's Jill, still stuck</i>
<i> in hell, you know what to do.</i>

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:44.632
Hey, it's me!

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:47.668
Again, I don't know where you
are, or if you're okay...

01:16:47.670 --> 01:16:52.974
Or maybe just in one of your
funks, but I wanted to--

01:16:52.976 --> 01:16:57.178
I don't know how to say this,
but, um, I wanted to talk...

01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:00.247
Because well, it's too long
to leave on a message...

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:07.121
But I was thinking of taking
off... leaving town.

01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:15.329
Anyway, uh, text me, call me...

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:18.132
Um, and don't be weird.

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:22.236
Okay, bye.

01:17:27.377 --> 01:17:30.778
Yeah, baby!
All night long, huh?

01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.947
One minute at a time.

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:35.783
You need any more? I got more.

01:17:35.785 --> 01:17:37.818
Just give me five minutes.

01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:38.953
That's doubtful.

01:17:38.955 --> 01:17:43.157
Okay? Just five minutes.
Yeah.

01:17:58.107 --> 01:18:00.074
You asshole.

01:18:07.784 --> 01:18:10.384
<i> So, you like what you see?</i>

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:13.287
<i> You look amazing.</i>

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:15.056
<i> Oh, I know.</i>

01:18:15.058 --> 01:18:16.957
<i> So don't ask me that?</i>

01:18:29.772 --> 01:18:32.840
<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:19:03.773 --> 01:19:09.376
<i> Hate me! Oh, fuck!</i>

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:15.082
<i> Come on, come on!</i>
<i> Oh, yeah! Yes!</i>

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:58.092
One is-- no, no, you can't
fucking play that.

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:02.863
Hey.

01:20:02.865 --> 01:20:06.300
Yeah, I don't-- I don't know.
It's-- I don't--

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:10.571
okay, so I know this might sound
lame, but I think I might
go to bed.

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.173
Is that lame?

01:20:12.175 --> 01:20:13.908
No, no, it's not lame at all.

01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:15.476
I mean, you can stay up
or whatever.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:18.913
Yeah, is it cool, will the
computer screen keep you up?

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:21.382
No, not at all, it's cool.

01:20:21.384 --> 01:20:24.418
I can go downst-- I don't mind,
i can finish up and--

01:20:25.521 --> 01:20:27.488
yeah, I'm gonna go downstairs.

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:31.192
Oh, okay, you don't have to,
i can just turn over
to the other side.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:33.127
It's fine, I'll just um--
are you sure?

01:20:33.129 --> 01:20:36.564
Yeah, yeah, so you can just
chill and get some sleep.

01:20:36.566 --> 01:20:40.568
And it's totally fine, um--
sleep well.

01:20:40.570 --> 01:20:43.504
Thanks for showing me
those pictures.

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:47.074
Yeah, of course,
they're great pictures.

01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:48.909
All right, you sure
you're gonna be cool?

01:20:48.911 --> 01:20:51.078
Yeah.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:54.415
All right, let me know
if you need anything,
I'll be down there.

01:20:56.052 --> 01:20:58.586
Goodnight.
All right, goodnight.

01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.373
Hey, Peter!

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:23.077
Peter!

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:20.434
Rose!

01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:27.441
Rose! Hey!

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:34.548
Rose!

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:36.317
What the fuck?

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:53.467
Agh!

01:23:01.544 --> 01:23:04.044
Peter!

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.430
Colleen!

01:24:08.344 --> 01:24:11.045
Peter!

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:18.719
Trip?

01:24:27.496 --> 01:24:29.463
Guys!

01:24:30.533 --> 01:24:32.766
This isn't funny!

01:24:32.768 --> 01:24:35.169
Not yet, Colleen.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.353
- Fuck.
- Victoria?

01:25:40.903 --> 01:25:43.704
You weren't really thinking
about leaving, were you?

01:25:48.277 --> 01:25:50.544
Nobody ever leaves.

01:26:32.955 --> 01:26:37.591
This is your big moment.

01:29:36.438 --> 01:29:38.004
Oh.

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:45.412
It's okay.
Colleen, it's okay.

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:49.116
Colleen, Colleen, it's okay.
Colleen?

01:29:49.118 --> 01:29:51.985
It's me... it's tom.

01:30:05.567 --> 01:30:07.901
Colleen?

01:30:09.872 --> 01:30:11.805
Colleen?

01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:14.975
Colleen, can you look at me?

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:27.654
Wow, you look real good,
Colleen.

01:30:30.993 --> 01:30:35.095
We want to try one,
but with your-- your hair up.

01:30:45.974 --> 01:30:49.910
No! Don't kill me, please!

01:30:49.912 --> 01:30:53.480
No! Agh! No!
