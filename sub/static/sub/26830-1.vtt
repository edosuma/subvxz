Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:46.722 --> 01:52.327
I'm just not happy anymore.

02:00.535 --> 02:03.003
There's gotta be
something I can say...

02:03.005 --> 02:06.839
Stillman, I didn't
just think this up overnight.

02:06.841 --> 02:09.312
I've been sick about it
for weeks.

02:10.011 --> 02:14.381
Okay. At least
just let me say my piece.

02:14.383 --> 02:15.752
Of course, yeah.

02:16.085 --> 02:17.787
Well, what about...

02:21.856 --> 02:23.659
I don't know what to say.

02:29.098 --> 02:31.833
Well, you know
you can call me anytime,

02:33.502 --> 02:34.704
but I'm gonna go.

02:40.676 --> 02:43.442
Okay, let me say my piece.

02:43.444 --> 02:44.545
Of course, yeah.

02:45.046 --> 02:48.984
Well, what about the fact
that you are my favorite person?

02:49.818 --> 02:52.689
My unpredictable
free-spirited best friend?

02:53.055 --> 02:56.455
Yet we look at the world
so differently, like,

02:56.457 --> 02:58.458
so differently,
it's fascinating.

02:58.460 --> 03:02.865
And as unlikely as it is,
we are meant to be together.

03:03.532 --> 03:06.833
And I know that is true because
I am more myself around you

03:06.835 --> 03:09.635
than I ever was
before we knew each other.

03:09.637 --> 03:13.041
And I know at some point,
you felt all that about me, too.

03:14.742 --> 03:16.345
What about all that?

03:16.744 --> 03:19.115
- I still think we should break up.
- Right.

03:20.148 --> 03:22.818
Well, you know
you can call me anytime,

03:23.986 --> 03:25.121
but I'm gonna go.

03:31.058 --> 03:32.361
That was a bust.

03:39.434 --> 03:41.668
Okay, think about it
for one second.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.373
What is your heart telling you?

03:44.039 --> 03:45.875
That we should break up.

03:46.775 --> 03:47.973
Ignore your heart.

03:47.975 --> 03:49.175
What is your head
telling you to do?

03:49.177 --> 03:50.445
Break up.

03:50.646 --> 03:52.782
Debbie, I will never
do better than you.

03:53.515 --> 03:54.984
You'll never do better than me.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.920
We will never do better
than each other.

04:03.859 --> 04:05.157
Here you go.

04:05.159 --> 04:07.062
What is it about me
specifically?

04:07.996 --> 04:09.962
- You're a little rigid sometimes.
- Rigid?

04:09.964 --> 04:10.900
Yes.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.569
You wanna break up? Cool.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.702
What was the stupidest thing I did
the entire time we were together?

04:17.704 --> 04:20.839
- Please define neurotic.
- Put away your notebook.

04:20.841 --> 04:22.542
You know what,
I'm breaking up with you.

04:22.544 --> 04:23.945
I'm breaking up with you.

04:28.015 --> 04:29.518
Did that work? Anything?

04:30.219 --> 04:32.118
I should go.
We should break up.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.619
I'm gonna go.

04:33.621 --> 04:34.487
Break up.
We should break it off.

04:34.489 --> 04:35.821
I should go.

04:35.823 --> 04:37.726
- Go, go, go.
- All right!

04:39.126 --> 04:40.128
I get it.

04:42.830 --> 04:43.932
I'm gonna go.

04:50.272 --> 04:51.741
But I'm not giving up.

06:14.623 --> 06:15.858
What went wrong?

06:19.193 --> 06:20.595
Stillman!

06:22.063 --> 06:23.597
I can hear you in there.

06:23.599 --> 06:25.931
- Are you killing yourself?
- What? No.

06:25.933 --> 06:28.001
Look, man, you were depressed
and heartbroken

06:28.003 --> 06:30.973
and although I loved the automatic
4.0, that's no reason to...

06:32.073 --> 06:33.806
- Can you shut up?
- There you are, man.

06:33.808 --> 06:36.710
You're lucky I found you.
I was worried about you.

06:36.712 --> 06:38.845
Found me? No, I called you.

06:38.847 --> 06:40.716
Yeah, I was still
super freaked out.

06:42.984 --> 06:45.754
Wow, you've been busy.
Ooh, drinks.

06:48.356 --> 06:51.991
- Are you high?
- Right now? Sure.

06:51.993 --> 06:54.693
Coincidentally, but you've been
gone for, like, a week.

06:54.695 --> 06:56.229
I was worried often
during that time.

06:56.231 --> 06:57.133
I've been working.

06:59.166 --> 07:00.635
And I need your help.

07:03.337 --> 07:05.171
Whoa, how do you play
this thing?

07:05.173 --> 07:06.275
It's not a game.

07:07.875 --> 07:11.080
This is my relationship
with Debbie.

07:12.279 --> 07:13.916
Wow, that's actually
really cool.

07:16.784 --> 07:20.919
But also super sad. Like
you're stalking your own life.

07:20.921 --> 07:23.323
Yeah, I know,
it's a little pathetic,

07:23.325 --> 07:25.724
but I have to
get everything laid out

07:25.726 --> 07:27.660
if I'm ever
gonna find the answer.

07:27.662 --> 07:30.900
Yeah, of course you do.
What's the question?

07:31.198 --> 07:32.335
What went wrong?

07:32.834 --> 07:35.234
Look, if you go back
to last year.

07:35.236 --> 07:37.270
Go back. Use this.

07:37.272 --> 07:38.674
Back to the beginning.

07:40.142 --> 07:41.077
Day one.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.121
So it has the sound wave
built in resonance.

07:56.123 --> 07:58.023
They could theoretically
affect the structure

07:58.025 --> 08:00.794
of an existing superstring,
which can... can we just think

08:00.796 --> 08:03.866
of how freaking
mind-blowing that is?

08:08.135 --> 08:09.838
And when do
the harmonics come in?

08:10.137 --> 08:13.773
The harmonics are constant
but as they build exponentially,

08:13.775 --> 08:16.109
the superstring
becomes relative.

08:16.111 --> 08:18.681
- A-ha.
- Do you get it?

08:19.046 --> 08:20.749
No, I don't think so.

08:22.818 --> 08:24.387
That's it for today, class.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.388
Amazing work, Stillman.
Really advanced stuff.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.256
Nobody can hang with Stillman.

08:30.258 --> 08:31.991
I mean, I'll help him out
sometimes when he gets stuck,

08:31.993 --> 08:33.258
but for everybody else,
forget it.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.095
- That never happens.
- It happens.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.265
What are you doing here?
Don't you have Frisbee class?

08:37.799 --> 08:39.099
Okay, well,
it's not a class, it's a team,

08:39.101 --> 08:40.866
and I think you know that.

08:40.869 --> 08:42.835
And also, we just had practice,
so now you and me

08:42.837 --> 08:44.336
are gonna go to the whole
going away party thing

08:44.338 --> 08:45.741
at the place with the chick.

08:46.808 --> 08:48.244
Well, that's gonna be
really awkward.

08:48.843 --> 08:50.276
Well, yeah, of course
it's gonna be awkward.

08:50.278 --> 08:52.378
Your awkwardness is constant.

08:52.380 --> 08:55.217
Her discomfort is relative, and
that is what we have to solve.

08:57.184 --> 08:58.253
You like what I did there?

09:00.889 --> 09:01.690
Last one.

09:05.025 --> 09:06.859
I told you this
was gonna be weird.

09:06.861 --> 09:10.062
It's clearly just for her friends.
Her really cool friends.

09:10.064 --> 09:12.167
Friends and loyal customers
like us.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.035
Look, here you go.
She's still working.

09:19.775 --> 09:24.847
- Kiwi daiquiri. Appletini.
- IPA. Rum and coke.

09:26.781 --> 09:28.483
Oh, shoot. Okay.

09:30.251 --> 09:32.854
- Wow, she is just the worst.
- I know.

09:33.487 --> 09:35.056
Kind of adorable, though.

09:38.226 --> 09:40.093
Who do you think that guy is?

09:40.095 --> 09:41.927
Man, don't worry about
Selena Gomez over there.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.329
Worry about
what you're gonna say.

09:43.331 --> 09:45.167
This is your last chance
to say goodbye.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.032
And hello, for that
matter.

09:47.034 --> 09:49.402
- Wait, I got an idea.
- Yeah? What's up?

09:49.404 --> 09:52.408
- Temporal consistency isn't just...
- Wait, wait, a nerd idea?

09:52.973 --> 09:54.876
- Well, I gotta get it down.
- Dude, no.

09:56.310 --> 09:59.378
Look, she is super-hot
and I'm kind of a dork, so...

09:59.380 --> 10:01.880
- You're just used to it.
- Exactly!

10:01.882 --> 10:03.182
So even if that
isn't her boyfriend,

10:03.184 --> 10:05.018
what are we gonna
connect about?

10:05.020 --> 10:06.985
- Tell her you're a math genius.
- I'm a physics genius.

10:06.987 --> 10:09.357
And I don't know what
she's gonna think of that.

10:10.158 --> 10:14.163
Well, you're gonna have to
actually talk to her to find out.

10:16.264 --> 10:19.268
All right, I'll just be honest.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.237
Honesty's cool, right?

10:24.505 --> 10:25.507
Mm-hmm.

10:31.579 --> 10:33.214
Diet Dr. Pepper?

10:33.448 --> 10:37.082
No, I was just gonna ask,
today's your last day, right?

10:37.084 --> 10:38.383
It sure is.

10:38.385 --> 10:40.286
Well, we're really
gonna miss you.

10:40.288 --> 10:42.622
I think you're the best
bartender in the whole city.

10:42.624 --> 10:45.427
Oh, that's very sweet of you...

10:46.060 --> 10:47.428
- Stillman.
- Stillman.

10:47.996 --> 10:50.399
'Cause I actually think
I'm a terrible bartender

10:51.165 --> 10:54.002
Oh, big-time.
I meant like as a person.

10:54.302 --> 10:56.201
Oh.

10:56.203 --> 10:58.370
Uh, so where are you moving to?

10:58.372 --> 10:59.974
Oh, I'm not moving.
I just got fired.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.109
The owner's a friend, and she
did me a favor by hiring me

11:03.111 --> 11:05.847
and she kind of really did me
a favor by firing me, too.

11:06.347 --> 11:07.382
How?

11:08.082 --> 11:10.016
Well, I'm a musician,
so, you know.

11:10.018 --> 11:11.517
So you'll get
your demo together.

11:11.519 --> 11:14.023
Do some gigs. Expand
your career possibilities.

11:15.222 --> 11:17.190
Yeah, sure.

11:17.192 --> 11:19.962
I mean, those are all great ideas,
but I don't really have a plan.

11:20.428 --> 11:22.597
- For your career?
- For anything.

11:23.063 --> 11:26.467
Now, sure, I'd love to be successful
but I'd love to do lots of stuff.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.938
As much of stuff
as I can, forever.

11:29.437 --> 11:31.237
That's kind of my only plan.

11:31.239 --> 11:33.672
Plus, you can't really
control your career anyway.

11:33.674 --> 11:36.945
Or really anything, anyway.
Don't you think?

11:37.444 --> 11:38.414
Yeah.

11:40.180 --> 11:41.983
You're a terrible liar.

11:42.250 --> 11:46.551
You're challenging some really
deeply held personal beliefs.

11:48.356 --> 11:50.860
I thought it would just be
simpler if I said "yeah."

11:53.528 --> 11:55.228
So what about you?

11:55.230 --> 11:57.529
- I'm a physics student.
- Really? That's cool.

11:57.531 --> 11:59.165
I'm a student, too.

11:59.167 --> 12:01.066
- Like, on and off.
- What are you studying?

12:01.068 --> 12:03.136
Lots of things.

12:03.138 --> 12:06.505
Just not in, like, the regimented
way that you're supposed to.

12:06.507 --> 12:08.707
Like, last semester
I went to Hawaii.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.912
- To study?
- To go to Hawaii.

12:11.379 --> 12:14.413
So now the school isn't really sure
if they want to let me back in,

12:14.415 --> 12:18.553
and I'm not really sure if I want
to let them let me, so there.

12:20.989 --> 12:22.258
So there.

12:25.025 --> 12:27.096
- But you like it?
- Yeah, I love it.

12:27.328 --> 12:29.494
I'm in a kind of
accelerated program.

12:29.496 --> 12:31.532
I come in,
I need to be ready to work.

12:32.132 --> 12:35.368
I just love, like,
the proofs and the equations.

12:35.370 --> 12:37.239
The whole riddle of it all.

12:38.439 --> 12:40.541
I don't think I've ever loved
anything that much.

12:42.209 --> 12:45.110
Well, have you
ever considered physics?

12:45.112 --> 12:46.244
Not until now.

12:46.246 --> 12:49.581
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, darling.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.584
You're not allowed in my bar.

12:51.586 --> 12:53.418
- Don't ignore us.
- I'm not ignoring you.

12:53.420 --> 12:54.586
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.

12:54.588 --> 12:57.058
I'm just working.
Get back there.

12:57.424 --> 12:59.560
- You're not allowed.
- Where'd your friend go?

13:01.029 --> 13:01.931
I don't know.

13:03.030 --> 13:04.263
So what happened?

13:04.265 --> 13:05.333
It got weird.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.303
Can we just get out of here?

13:08.269 --> 13:11.373
Okay. Ready for takeoff.

13:17.278 --> 13:18.677
- Yes!
- Evan, are you high?

13:18.679 --> 13:19.778
- Hmm?
- Are you high?

13:19.780 --> 13:21.547
What?

13:21.549 --> 13:23.485
- Did you just get high in the bathroom?
- No.

13:24.685 --> 13:26.521
Not in the bathroom.

13:27.454 --> 13:29.088
Guess again, please.

13:30.457 --> 13:31.626
You're too high to drive.

13:33.127 --> 13:34.462
How do you know how high I am?

14:03.424 --> 14:04.559
What is that?

14:05.260 --> 14:08.261
It's math stuff.
Look at all this.

14:08.263 --> 14:11.200
- It's amazing.
- I'm allergic to math.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.733
There's Andy.
I'll get a ride with him.

14:13.735 --> 14:15.734
Man, dude, no way.
I'm totally fine.

14:15.736 --> 14:17.470
Besides, you can't ride
with the enemy.

14:17.472 --> 14:20.105
Enemy? What, is that,
like, a Frisbee thing?

14:20.107 --> 14:21.542
If you mean Ultimate Frisbee,
then yeah.

14:22.177 --> 14:24.109
No, stop, I'm serious.

14:24.111 --> 14:26.378
Dude, the guy is
smug and ungracious.

14:26.380 --> 14:29.485
Andy! Andy, are you going to Henley?

14:29.818 --> 14:32.518
No, I'm going to teach
your mother organic chemistry.

14:32.520 --> 14:34.387
- All right.
- It's not funny.

14:34.389 --> 14:37.090
- Sorry, just joking around.
- Well, I'm coming with you.

14:37.092 --> 14:40.662
- Traitor.
- Hey, you forgot your...

14:46.266 --> 14:47.365
Ah!

14:47.367 --> 14:48.403
- Stillman?
- Oh, my God!

14:49.837 --> 14:51.671
Oh, my God, are you dead?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.642
- Please don't be dead.
- Dead? Why are you saying dead?

14:54.108 --> 14:56.377
No, I'm gonna get help.
I'll get help.

15:03.284 --> 15:05.754
- Are you okay?
- I'm perfect.

15:08.323 --> 15:09.390
But...

15:10.658 --> 15:12.226
But I need to do something.

15:15.295 --> 15:17.229
Before I forget.

15:17.231 --> 15:19.233
For a second, I thought
you were grabbing at me.

15:21.401 --> 15:23.335
It must be pretty important.

15:23.337 --> 15:25.307
No, none of this other stuff is,
but I just figured something out.

15:32.847 --> 15:34.647
You know, I don't know
what any of that stuff is,

15:34.649 --> 15:36.284
but it looks pretty cool.

15:37.351 --> 15:38.252
Really?

15:40.554 --> 15:41.589
Yeah.

15:47.161 --> 15:48.793
You know, I still feel
I never got proper credit

15:48.795 --> 15:50.428
for hitting you with my car.

15:50.430 --> 15:53.201
Well, I think we see
that moment a bit differently.

15:53.834 --> 15:55.203
Anyway, look.

15:56.304 --> 15:58.303
I got smiley faces for all
my good memories, right?

15:58.305 --> 16:02.443
The stuff I don't regret. I
made a kind of crude slideshow.

16:02.876 --> 16:04.412
Help us stay organized.

16:06.380 --> 16:08.413
Yeah, so crude.

16:14.188 --> 16:15.323
See, we can be happy.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.391
Look at that mane!

16:18.393 --> 16:20.859
- Are you kidding?
- Evan, can you stay focused?

16:20.861 --> 16:22.494
On what, man?

16:22.496 --> 16:24.599
Other than sad,
what is this whole thing?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.933
Well, this is what
we need to address.

16:27.935 --> 16:30.769
Ah, red dots.
Now we're getting somewhere.

16:30.771 --> 16:33.641
These are all my shitty moments
from last year.

16:34.741 --> 16:37.712
Well, my year would probably
just be one solid red line.

16:38.279 --> 16:40.412
This is why we broke up, Evan.

16:40.414 --> 16:42.614
The computer can tell you
why you broke up?

16:42.616 --> 16:46.420
- That's amazing.
- Look. Day 37.

16:47.989 --> 16:49.925
Day 51 and 52.

16:51.458 --> 16:54.595
Day 70. All this stuff I regret.

17:05.707 --> 17:06.909
Interesting.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.878
Really? Over Y? You think so?

17:12.380 --> 17:16.549
Well, if you think it's gonna
prove the proof then go ahead.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.685
- Are you making fun of me?
- I'm flirting with you, dummy.

17:19.686 --> 17:21.853
- Your genius is hot.
- Oh, yeah?

17:21.855 --> 17:27.291
- Oh, what, you think this is irresistible?
- Ooh, talk physics to me.

17:27.294 --> 17:28.329
Okay.

17:29.264 --> 17:31.897
You're positively expanding
monomial.

17:31.899 --> 17:34.699
Oh! Give me something else.

17:34.701 --> 17:37.772
- I'm gonna lie tangent to your curves.
- Oh, I love it.

17:38.372 --> 17:39.607
I love you.

18:03.765 --> 18:04.733
Scoot.

18:06.967 --> 18:08.303
What is this?

18:09.036 --> 18:10.671
In case I forget the words.

18:12.340 --> 18:14.773
- You're playing me a song.
- And I never play for anyone.

18:14.775 --> 18:15.811
I know you don't.

18:17.711 --> 18:20.348
You just... you trust me
with something, Stillman.

18:20.782 --> 18:23.983
And it really means a lot,
so I kind of want

18:23.985 --> 18:25.520
to trust you with something.

18:26.987 --> 18:29.658
This was kind of inspired by us.

18:33.894 --> 18:37.265
<i>♪ Take my hand
And walk along ♪</i>

18:37.765 --> 18:40.901
<i>♪ As I share with you my song ♪</i>

18:41.803 --> 18:47.309
<i>♪ My heart is full of doubt
And words will fail me ♪</i>

18:49.444 --> 18:52.447
<i>♪ You were taller than a tree ♪</i>

18:52.979 --> 18:55.950
<i>♪ But the bats will carry me ♪</i>

18:56.717 --> 19:02.490

19:04.025 --> 19:07.496

19:20.675 --> 19:22.377
- Yay.
- Yay!

19:22.909 --> 19:25.813
- Yeah. God, what a voice.
- Thank you.

19:26.546 --> 19:27.748
What's it about?

19:28.749 --> 19:29.684
I don't know.

19:30.418 --> 19:31.486
You don't know?

19:33.121 --> 19:36.155
Well, am I the dude
taller than a tree

19:36.157 --> 19:37.659
or am I the howling monkey?

19:38.892 --> 19:41.829
I never thought about it
like that.

19:44.532 --> 19:45.567
I see.

19:47.869 --> 19:49.905
- You're disappointed.
- No.

19:50.604 --> 19:52.504
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not.

19:52.506 --> 19:54.109
You're doing that thing where
you don't say what you feel.

19:56.977 --> 19:59.911
Well, honestly,
I was kind of waiting

19:59.913 --> 20:01.582
for the line that's like,

20:03.551 --> 20:07.389
<i>♪ And I love you, too,
Stillman ♪</i>

20:08.589 --> 20:10.688
Or, just like,

20:10.690 --> 20:13.027
<i>♪ You're really cool
But I'm not ready yet ♪</i>

20:15.162 --> 20:18.032
- You don't think I love you?
- I don't know.

20:18.565 --> 20:21.000
I know I said it
then you ran off,

20:21.002 --> 20:23.572
and then you came back
and sang a song about a monkey.

20:26.173 --> 20:27.408
I love you.

20:28.642 --> 20:32.043
But, you know,
I've said it to lots of guys

20:32.045 --> 20:34.716
and I just... I kind of
wanted this to be different.

20:35.182 --> 20:36.917
Sorry it upset you.

20:38.686 --> 20:39.855
All right.

20:40.053 --> 20:43.621
You know,
you're different from anyone

20:43.623 --> 20:47.459
I've ever dated or really
anyone I've ever known.

20:47.461 --> 20:49.530
You're brilliant
and you're driven

20:49.964 --> 20:53.465
and I respect
your opinion a lot

20:53.467 --> 20:55.467
That's why I was scared
to play this for you,

20:55.469 --> 20:58.472
because I don't really treat
my work like you treat yours.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.675
But then, you know, like,
I realized that

21:02.677 --> 21:06.915
if you didn't like it,
you'd find a nice way to tell me

21:07.982 --> 21:10.549
because in addition to being one
of the smartest people I know,

21:10.551 --> 21:12.120
you're also one of the kindest.

21:14.255 --> 21:18.159
Well, baby, then there is no
reason to be sorry, okay?

21:18.793 --> 21:20.061
That was a great song.

21:21.496 --> 21:23.063
- Do you want to play it again?
- Not really.

21:23.663 --> 21:24.865
Okay, I don't blame you.

21:28.034 --> 21:29.070
I love you.

21:30.705 --> 21:31.807
I love you, too.

21:38.713 --> 21:40.745
Oh, what a piece of shit.

21:40.747 --> 21:42.080
Huh?

21:42.082 --> 21:43.784
I regret seeing
this crapfest, too.

21:44.118 --> 21:46.217
No, that's not why
that's up there.

21:46.219 --> 21:48.088
All right, <i>Farallon Five</i>
is a masterpiece.

21:48.823 --> 21:50.592
Right. I forgot.

21:57.797 --> 21:59.733
Well, what'd you guys think?

22:05.305 --> 22:09.143
It was good. Yeah. Yeah.

22:14.114 --> 22:15.848
- Stop it.
- I can't help it.

22:15.850 --> 22:17.215
It was good.

22:17.217 --> 22:20.988
- It's...
- Holy crap, that movie sucked!

22:21.621 --> 22:24.023
Boring and confusing.
That's a neat trick.

22:24.025 --> 22:26.792
That was
an intergalactic suckfest

22:26.794 --> 22:29.695
with bad robot acting
and how about that blue...

22:29.697 --> 22:31.296
what the blue...
with the blue face...

22:31.298 --> 22:32.965
- Yeah, I don't know. I didn't get that.
- What?

22:32.967 --> 22:35.734
Hey, why was that dude's
face blue, anyway?

22:35.736 --> 22:39.304
- I mean, that...
- Whatever. All right, whatever.

22:39.306 --> 22:42.875
Like, enough about
<i>Farallon Five.</i>

22:42.877 --> 22:44.842
You keep laughing about it.

22:44.844 --> 22:47.649
I bet you couldn't if I donkey
slapped you in the back of the head.

22:53.086 --> 22:54.021
What?

22:55.089 --> 22:56.525
That's disgusting.

22:57.792 --> 23:01.193
I wasn't making a gay joke.
If that's what you're thinking.

23:01.195 --> 23:04.032
I mean, a donkey slap
was for everyone.

23:04.732 --> 23:05.901
How sweet.

23:15.141 --> 23:17.344
I'm not even totally sure
what a donkey slap is.

23:21.215 --> 23:23.648
Okay, so, yeah,

23:23.650 --> 23:25.984
I mean, I think everyone
remembers Day 122.

23:25.986 --> 23:28.087
Not your finest hour,
but you really think

23:28.089 --> 23:30.688
- that had anything to do with...
- Maybe, maybe not.

23:30.690 --> 23:32.690
It was kind of early on.

23:32.692 --> 23:35.060
All right, maybe this is just
'cause I'm coming down a little,

23:35.062 --> 23:37.098
but what's the point
of all this?

23:37.765 --> 23:39.100
It could've been different.

23:40.534 --> 23:42.701
It took you a week of sorting through
pictures to figure that out?

23:42.703 --> 23:43.972
Let me rephrase.

23:46.774 --> 23:47.875
It's gonna be different.

23:51.144 --> 23:56.080
See, it started as a kind
of wrinkle in my theorem,

23:56.082 --> 23:58.349
and that just kept expanding.

23:58.351 --> 24:02.857
And Evan, nothing focuses
your mind like a broken heart.

24:11.931 --> 24:14.169
Please don't tell me you think this
is what I think you think this is.

24:15.936 --> 24:17.802
- It's a time machine.
- No.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.772
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

24:19.774 --> 24:22.741
Stillman, okay, this breakup
is taking a very scary turn.

24:22.743 --> 24:24.842
I'm fulfilling my best friend
duties and I'm stepping in.

24:24.844 --> 24:28.179
Enough. Enough, man.
Time travel and Debbie?

24:28.181 --> 24:29.947
You gotta stop.

24:29.949 --> 24:31.917
Stop doing
crazy scientist things.

24:31.919 --> 24:34.086
Okay, that for sure
does not do anything.

24:34.088 --> 24:35.724
That keyboard
doesn't do anything.

24:36.056 --> 24:37.455
- None of this stuff does anything!
- Evan...

24:37.457 --> 24:38.823
Stillman, listen to me.

24:38.825 --> 24:40.391
- You gotta move on.
- Evan!

24:40.393 --> 24:42.730
- It's time to move on.
- She is the love of my life.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.963
You understand?

24:44.965 --> 24:46.865
I am never gonna find
anyone better than her.

24:46.867 --> 24:50.401
She accepts
my haltingly analytical mind

24:50.403 --> 24:52.804
whilst just encouraging me
to just roll with shit.

24:52.806 --> 24:56.375
She is a kind, carefree spirit

24:56.377 --> 25:00.915
with so much compassion and empathy, she
could love the stupidest of people.

25:01.148 --> 25:02.951
I admire her so much.

25:03.817 --> 25:05.451
She's great, I know.

25:05.453 --> 25:08.089
And do you think I can just
move on from someone like that?

25:09.790 --> 25:10.955
Well, I'm hoping...

25:10.957 --> 25:14.094
um, yes?

25:15.329 --> 25:18.830
No, no, not while I know
what I know.

25:18.832 --> 25:20.365
Oh, good, what do you know?

25:20.367 --> 25:23.836
I know that there is
an elastic temporal quality

25:23.838 --> 25:25.904
to all preexisting phenomena.

25:25.906 --> 25:26.941
Evan...

25:28.074 --> 25:30.141
I can change what I did wrong.

25:30.143 --> 25:33.280
I have created what
every broken heart wants.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.085
A second chance.

25:43.890 --> 25:46.023
I hope you're calling your
shrink on that thing.

25:46.025 --> 25:48.392
No, this controls the machine.

25:48.394 --> 25:51.129
My phone here
talks to my phone in the past.

25:51.131 --> 25:54.966
- No, it doesn't.
- Look, I need help.

25:54.968 --> 25:58.169
- Yes, yes.
- No, I need your help, Evan.

25:58.171 --> 26:00.007
I need you to come back with me.

26:03.076 --> 26:04.178
You want me to come...

26:05.111 --> 26:06.779
- Yes.
- No!

26:06.781 --> 26:09.348
- That's why I called you.
- No! I'm not going to...

26:09.350 --> 26:12.984
Look, Evan, you've been here for every
single moment of this relationship,

26:12.986 --> 26:15.223
and you usually give
pretty good advice.

26:16.923 --> 26:18.956
Look, you don't even
believe this works.

26:18.958 --> 26:21.196
- What's the danger?
- I believe it could give me a seizure.

26:22.897 --> 26:24.929
And let me ask you,
have you tried talking to her?

26:24.931 --> 26:26.865
Because that's what
most people do after a breakup.

26:26.867 --> 26:29.100
You know, before hopping straight
to the whole time travel thing.

26:29.102 --> 26:31.869
Yes, hundreds of times.
It doesn't work.

26:31.871 --> 26:33.874
Evan, trust me,
this is the only way.

26:36.243 --> 26:39.114
Please! Help me.

26:41.948 --> 26:42.950
Okay.

26:44.052 --> 26:46.855
- Yes.
- Where are we going in your time machine?

26:51.292 --> 26:52.858
- No, come back.
- What are you doing?

26:52.860 --> 26:53.762
Come here.

26:55.528 --> 26:56.497
I don't like that.

27:18.384 --> 27:19.851
Holy shit, that hurts!

27:19.853 --> 27:21.119
- Oh.
- Oh, my God!

27:21.121 --> 27:22.321
- Do this.
- Huh?

27:22.323 --> 27:23.291
Do this.

27:24.557 --> 27:27.859
Your consciousness was just
thrown into another icon state.

27:27.861 --> 27:29.496
- It's gonna sting.
- Wait, you mean it worked?

27:30.296 --> 27:33.064
Of course it worked.
Look where we are.

27:33.066 --> 27:35.969
We're at Captain Frank's,
the day you hit me with the car.

27:36.169 --> 27:38.038
Last year, day one.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.442
So then, where's the me
from last year?

27:43.444 --> 27:45.280
Am I gonna have
to fight him or something?

27:46.346 --> 27:48.048
You are the you from last year.

27:48.482 --> 27:50.952
I mean, look at your clothes
and your gut.

27:51.384 --> 27:52.286
Your hair!

27:54.321 --> 27:55.920
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah!

27:55.922 --> 27:57.188
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

27:57.190 --> 27:58.624
- You're not crazy.
- Yeah.

27:58.626 --> 28:00.259
You invented
a motherhumping time machine.

28:00.261 --> 28:01.592
Do you know what this means?

28:01.594 --> 28:03.227
We can go anywhere. Do anything.

28:03.229 --> 28:05.163
We could...
we could run with the Vikings.

28:05.165 --> 28:06.932
We could go to wizard school.

28:06.934 --> 28:09.568
No. What? No, we can't go back
to literary fiction.

28:09.570 --> 28:12.607
Anyway, we're not here
to do anything.

28:13.407 --> 28:15.139
We're here to get Debbie back,
all right?

28:15.141 --> 28:19.514
And the moment I do,
this text will disappear...

28:20.147 --> 28:22.283
...and I'll know her and I
stay together.

28:23.217 --> 28:24.649
Seriously?

28:24.651 --> 28:27.019
Yeah. Yeah, that's why
I asked you to come.

28:27.021 --> 28:29.490
- You agreed.
- Yeah, that was before I knew it worked.

28:30.390 --> 28:33.292
Look, all I'm saying is
on the scale of possibilities,

28:33.294 --> 28:35.627
going back a year in time
to get your girlfriend back,

28:35.629 --> 28:37.495
it's kind of low-fi.

28:37.497 --> 28:39.066
- Not to me.
- Then what the hell am I doing here?

28:40.668 --> 28:41.602
All right.

28:42.436 --> 28:44.105
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:50.476 --> 28:51.976
That was crazy.

28:51.978 --> 28:53.512
That she brought us fries
we didn't order?

28:53.514 --> 28:56.650
No, just seeing her like that.

29:00.153 --> 29:01.455
- Okay.
- These are cheese fries.

29:02.221 --> 29:03.955
Frank's doesn't even make
cheese fries anymore.

29:03.957 --> 29:05.259
This... Oh!

29:06.092 --> 29:08.062
We really did
travel through time.

29:08.661 --> 29:09.329
Cheese fry?

29:12.032 --> 29:13.668
That really messed you up, huh?

29:14.301 --> 29:16.905
The last time I saw her,
she was breaking up with me

29:17.303 --> 29:18.939
over and over again.

29:20.707 --> 29:23.577
And now here she is,
at the beginning,

29:24.078 --> 29:27.411
before she knew me.

29:27.413 --> 29:28.982
Before I screwed everything up.

29:30.751 --> 29:32.921
All right, I can't look at you
like this anymore.

29:33.187 --> 29:34.054
I'm in.

29:34.521 --> 29:36.722
As long as you agree
that when we do succeed,

29:36.724 --> 29:38.322
your best buddy Evan gets to take
the time machine for a little spin

29:38.324 --> 29:40.425
to witness the birth
of the universe.

29:40.427 --> 29:42.060
- I will not agree to that.
- I'll just go down on Marilyn Monroe.

29:42.062 --> 29:43.695
No. And she's not
gonna have sex with you

29:43.697 --> 29:45.300
- just because you have a time machine.
- She's not?

29:46.265 --> 29:48.399
Okay, then how about I get to
fix my crap year a little?

29:48.401 --> 29:51.102
- Well, what do you have in mind?
- Can I win my Ultimate Frisbee league?

29:51.104 --> 29:54.541
Probably, but only if we get
Debbie back before your game.

29:55.309 --> 29:57.676
All right, I'll take it.
So what are we doing?

29:57.678 --> 29:59.644
What's the mission?
What's the mish?

29:59.646 --> 30:02.317
There's no mish.
This is the starting point.

30:02.615 --> 30:05.516
From here on out, we're
going forwards through time

30:05.518 --> 30:07.487
creating a new universe
as we go.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.588
Don't I have to hit you
with a car?

30:09.590 --> 30:12.323
- You will.
- Not if I know I'm going to.

30:12.325 --> 30:14.192
Okay, well, you might not,

30:14.194 --> 30:17.732
but as soon as we zap out
of these bodies in 25 seconds,

30:18.465 --> 30:20.799
they'll go on doing exactly
what we did before.

30:20.801 --> 30:23.368
I'll go hit on her awkwardly.
Go out.

30:23.370 --> 30:25.337
You hit me with the car.
She comes out to see me.

30:25.339 --> 30:28.275
- I'll come up with a theorem.
- Awesome, let's set shit right.

30:29.642 --> 30:31.810
- What are you doing?
- I gained, like, 30 pounds last year.

30:31.812 --> 30:34.215
I don't need to go on
eating these after we leave.

30:35.482 --> 30:36.384
Okay, last one.

30:36.749 --> 30:38.783
Oh!

30:38.785 --> 30:40.487
- Ah!
- Ow, where are we?

30:44.824 --> 30:46.126
Good luck.

30:46.360 --> 30:49.764
All right,
I think we're all ready.

30:51.165 --> 30:52.696
So what are we
watching here again, Stillman?

30:52.698 --> 30:54.002
Right. Um...

30:54.567 --> 30:58.736
So, this is considered by many

30:58.738 --> 31:02.073
to be one of the greatest
sci-fi movies ever made.

31:02.075 --> 31:03.678
Wait, dude, we haven't
even started the movie?

31:07.814 --> 31:09.616
And I'm already this excited?

31:10.150 --> 31:13.286
Wow, what a great way to spend the
next three and half hours, huh?

31:13.553 --> 31:17.225
Anyway, this is, like,
my favorite movie ever.

31:17.858 --> 31:22.127
Debbie has never seen it before, so I'm
excited to share it with you guys.

31:22.129 --> 31:25.733
- Yeah! Let's see some aliens. Right?
- Yay.

31:38.711 --> 31:41.646
Holy crap, that movie sucked!

31:41.648 --> 31:43.380
- Yeah, I didn't get that.
- His face... what?

31:43.382 --> 31:45.850
Hey, why was that dude's
face blue, anyway?

31:45.852 --> 31:49.120
- I mean, I must've missed that.
- You know what, guys?

31:49.122 --> 31:51.523
Like, rip into this movie
all you want.

31:51.525 --> 31:53.628
It doesn't bother me
that you don't like it.

31:54.628 --> 31:58.730
Because you are a humanoid who
likes movies that make no sense.

31:58.732 --> 32:01.398
It made perfect sense, Carly,

32:01.400 --> 32:03.135
but you clearly
don't understand it,

32:03.137 --> 32:05.606
and that makes you sound like
a dumb-ass bitch.

32:07.874 --> 32:08.842
Crap.

32:12.579 --> 32:14.311
- Yeah, I didn't get that.
- His face... what?

32:14.313 --> 32:16.848
Hey, why was that dude's
face blue, anyway?

32:16.850 --> 32:18.716
- I mean, I must've missed that.
- You know what, guys?

32:18.718 --> 32:22.186
Like, it's fine that
you hate this movie, all right?

32:22.188 --> 32:24.358
That is fine!

32:27.660 --> 32:29.194
- That's too loud.
- Way too loud.

32:29.196 --> 32:30.628
- Yeah, I didn't get that.
- His face... what?

32:30.630 --> 32:33.330
Hey, why was that dude's
face blue, anyway?

32:33.332 --> 32:35.500
I mean, that made no sense.

32:35.502 --> 32:36.671
Yeah.

32:39.805 --> 32:42.307
Hey, man, I can tell
this is upsetting you

32:42.309 --> 32:44.278
and that's not what
any of us want.

32:45.312 --> 32:48.346
- But I didn't say anything.
- We were just having a little fun.

32:48.348 --> 32:50.217
No hard feelings, okay, stud?

32:51.351 --> 32:54.552
- I didn't say anything!
- You didn't have to.

32:54.554 --> 32:56.187
All right, I'm gonna go back.

32:56.189 --> 32:57.589
We can watch it scene by scene.

32:57.591 --> 32:59.523
I'm gonna explain
exactly why you guys...

32:59.525 --> 33:01.292
- Oh, no. We got it.
- We got it.

33:01.294 --> 33:03.661
His skin is blue because
in the Ceetu-5 galaxy,

33:03.663 --> 33:05.496
they live in ultraviolet.

33:05.498 --> 33:07.831
- Did you... did you not get that?
- I thought it was great.

33:07.833 --> 33:09.603
- I thought it is...
- Oh, my God, no, this isn't working.

33:09.902 --> 33:11.735
After the movie.
After the movie. After...

33:11.737 --> 33:14.638
All right, look, go ahead,
poke fun at the movie.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.840
I have my opinions.
I don't care what you think.

33:16.842 --> 33:18.880
It's not like
you're hurting my feelings.

33:19.880 --> 33:24.249
- And... crap.
- Dude, this is the worst!

33:24.251 --> 33:26.984
It's taking forever!
It's worse than the movie!

33:26.986 --> 33:28.419
Wait, what are you
talking about?

33:28.421 --> 33:30.321
Okay, I have an idea.
Do it like this.

33:30.323 --> 33:31.856
- Yeah, I didn't get that.
- His face... what?

33:31.858 --> 33:34.658
Hey, why was that dude's
face blue, anyway?

33:34.660 --> 33:36.863
- I mean, I must've missed that.
- You know what, guys?

33:37.496 --> 33:41.632
I apologize, and in fact,
pizza is on me tonight.

33:43.503 --> 33:45.840
- Aw.
- Which is my little way of saying I'm sorry.

33:46.806 --> 33:48.608
Apology accepted.

33:49.476 --> 33:51.611
I am sorry that...

33:52.012 --> 33:54.378
- Here we go.
- Thank you, sir.

33:54.380 --> 33:58.250
You clearly
know nothing about movies.

33:58.252 --> 34:01.953
And you clearly misunderstood
such a work of art.

34:01.955 --> 34:03.424
So it's all on us?

34:04.423 --> 34:05.689
You uncultured heathens.

34:18.304 --> 34:20.474
- You saw the way she looked at me?
- I did. It was great.

34:21.474 --> 34:23.440
And I'm so much better
at this game than I was.

34:23.443 --> 34:25.042
I think that's how
she likes me best.

34:25.043 --> 34:27.277
You know, like, confident.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.313
Yeah, for sure.
What's up with the text?

34:29.315 --> 34:30.414
It's still there.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.784
I mean, it was the first stop.

34:33.418 --> 34:34.784
What the hell are you wearing?

34:34.786 --> 34:36.454
Rogaine.
I had this stuff all last year

34:36.456 --> 34:37.757
and could never decide
if I needed it.

34:38.324 --> 34:39.460
We both know how that turns out.

34:40.427 --> 34:41.992
It stays on for, like,
half an hour.

34:41.994 --> 34:43.893
- Well, we got two minutes.
- Two minutes till what?

34:43.896 --> 34:45.264
Till we jump out.

34:46.032 --> 34:47.634
We gotta keep moving forward.

34:48.367 --> 34:49.632
Wait, what?

34:49.635 --> 34:50.971
There's nothing left
to fix here.

34:51.804 --> 34:53.536
My hair!

34:53.539 --> 34:55.539
Relax, look, the cap
will stay on after we leave.

34:55.541 --> 34:58.475
Man, that's not the only thing.
I bomb my huge test tomorrow.

34:58.477 --> 35:00.711
So what, you're gonna do,
like, 90 seconds of homework?

35:00.713 --> 35:04.082
- Dude, I cannot flunk out again.
- Then why are you playing video games?

35:04.084 --> 35:05.950
That game was
a major distraction last year.

35:05.952 --> 35:07.051
I had to get it out of the way.

35:07.053 --> 35:08.952
Evan, if you want to graduate,

35:08.954 --> 35:11.488
you have to try and change
your overall attitude.

35:11.490 --> 35:13.490
Wait, that's good.
That's really good.

35:13.492 --> 35:15.760
I should inspire the me
I'm inhabiting now

35:15.762 --> 35:17.796
so when I zap out,
he'll be motivated, yeah?

35:17.798 --> 35:19.497
- Exactly.
- And he won't remember

35:19.499 --> 35:20.868
that I was in control
of this body?

35:21.501 --> 35:22.602
I don't think so.

35:23.736 --> 35:25.336
So, like, this Evan's
gonna look at all this reading

35:25.338 --> 35:26.937
and decide skip it
and smoke a bowl.

35:26.939 --> 35:29.510
Or go back to playing
"Call of Duty."

35:30.443 --> 35:31.512
Or both.

35:33.079 --> 35:34.347
I'm gonna write him a note.

35:35.448 --> 35:36.550
How much time do we have left?

35:36.816 --> 35:37.818
Thirty seconds.

35:44.057 --> 35:45.756
- That's your note?
- I don't have time

35:45.758 --> 35:47.360
to craft something more complex!

35:47.961 --> 35:49.397
I'm gonna leave him a message.

35:51.731 --> 35:54.466
Hey, man, so, this semester
don't be, like,

35:54.468 --> 35:55.934
a piece of shit
who doesn't do anything.

35:55.936 --> 35:57.604
- Maybe try...
- Why are you so mean?

35:58.070 --> 36:00.037
You're right. Yeah, I'm sorry.

36:00.039 --> 36:02.374
I love you
and you are a shooting star,

36:02.376 --> 36:03.944
but you just dick around
too much.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.378
Like a piece of shit sometimes.

36:06.380 --> 36:08.646
And you eat way too much
and you're literally always high

36:08.648 --> 36:11.383
and that's just not ideal for living
up to your awesome full potential.

36:11.385 --> 36:12.352
How much time do we have?

36:21.528 --> 36:23.831
Uh... Evan,
we'll take the stairs.

36:34.740 --> 36:36.874
- Ow!
- Come on.

36:36.876 --> 36:39.412
Evan's probably already up there
and I wanna dance!

36:39.813 --> 36:41.780
Oh, I think it's
up another floor.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.782
- What did the directions say?
- Oh, my phone died.

36:43.784 --> 36:45.983
- I don't know.
- How do we know where we're going?

36:45.985 --> 36:48.852
This is it. Top floor.
I feel it.

36:48.854 --> 36:50.888
Hey, yo, oh!

36:50.890 --> 36:52.890
No, it is not a party up here,

36:52.892 --> 36:55.396
but look at the view!

36:58.432 --> 36:59.898
Hey, you should get
Evan up here,

36:59.900 --> 37:01.434
and we can have
our own little dance party.

37:05.872 --> 37:07.842
- It's locked?
- Yeah.

37:14.981 --> 37:16.550
Hey, wait.

37:16.883 --> 37:18.783
What, you're not really scared,
are you?

37:18.785 --> 37:21.889
No, no, maybe I have,
like, a fear of being confined.

37:24.858 --> 37:26.160
Trapped is a better word.

37:33.467 --> 37:34.501
Hold on.

37:42.175 --> 37:44.077
Wait, what is happening here?

37:45.077 --> 37:46.045
What can I say?

37:46.912 --> 37:49.580
I'm a nerd of many...

37:49.582 --> 37:50.785
...nerdly obsessions.

37:57.490 --> 37:59.092
I can't believe
you just did that.

38:13.907 --> 38:15.075
Do it again.

38:37.664 --> 38:39.934
Ah. My foot. Again.

38:47.173 --> 38:49.477
You don't need that...
okay, wait, nobody...

38:50.977 --> 38:52.913
Damn it, my foot.

38:59.785 --> 39:01.753
Do it again.
Do it again.

39:01.755 --> 39:03.687
- Do it again.
- I'm just gonna take that from you.

39:03.689 --> 39:06.323
Less is more. Please keep
your scarf to yourself.

39:06.325 --> 39:08.695
Ah. Ah. Ah!

39:08.894 --> 39:11.164
What is this song?
Damn it, my foot!

39:11.631 --> 39:12.633
I'm losing my mind.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.700
And I forgive you.

39:15.702 --> 39:17.568
This is the worst song I've
ever heard in my entire life.

39:17.570 --> 39:19.637
Okay, guys,
this is my corner back here.

39:19.639 --> 39:20.805
Right? Private space.

39:20.807 --> 39:22.173
First it's this
and then tomorrow

39:22.175 --> 39:23.608
I don't know the alphabet
and the day after...

39:23.610 --> 39:24.742
Everybody out of my way.
Out of my way.

39:24.744 --> 39:26.945
I gotta go.
Nope. Hello?

39:34.588 --> 39:35.820
- <i>Dude?</i>
- Hey, man.

39:35.822 --> 39:37.754
I think I'm dead.

39:37.756 --> 39:39.222
Either I'm dead or the time
machine's broken or both.

39:39.224 --> 39:40.791
I don't know.
There's people looking at me.

39:40.793 --> 39:42.794
It's <i>Groundhog Day</i>
over here, man.

39:42.796 --> 39:44.164
- <i>Something's up.</i>
- Relax, all right? We're on the roof.

39:46.832 --> 39:48.832
Dude, dude,
that was a nightmare.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.667
That was the all-time
worst elevator ride to hell

39:50.669 --> 39:52.102
over and over and over
and over and over.

39:52.104 --> 39:53.905
- It's kind of my fault.
- Huh?

39:53.907 --> 39:56.207
I kept redoing this perfect
moment with Debbie,

39:56.209 --> 39:59.146
and whenever I redo something,
you gotta redo, too.

39:59.746 --> 40:01.081
If it was perfect,
what are we fixing?

40:01.981 --> 40:04.651
Nothing.
It was just really nice.

40:05.251 --> 40:09.120
Nice? We don't have time
to let my hair stuff set in,

40:09.122 --> 40:10.854
but you get to relive
the best of?

40:10.856 --> 40:13.226
You gonna come dance with me?
You too, Evan.

40:20.666 --> 40:22.700
What are you doing?

40:22.702 --> 40:24.001
- I just... I wanna see that again.
- No, no, no, that's it.

40:24.003 --> 40:25.702
- I'm taking over the mission.
- No.

40:25.704 --> 40:26.903
- I'm taking over the mission.
- What? No. Stop.

40:26.905 --> 40:28.840
I'm the mission commander now.

40:28.842 --> 40:30.311
- It's not... it's not a mission.
- You're telling me!

40:30.843 --> 40:33.914
Movie night,
your Houdini lockpick thing.

40:35.014 --> 40:38.316
Man, if we're gonna make this work,
you're gonna need to get into some shit.

40:38.318 --> 40:40.651
Some messy shit.

40:40.653 --> 40:42.720
We need a time when you were full-on
with the stick up your butt.

40:42.722 --> 40:44.722
Like, what about
the camping trip?

40:44.724 --> 40:45.923
Day 276.

40:47.860 --> 40:49.295
It's a party!

40:49.762 --> 40:52.863
- Wasn't that a total disaster?
- Yes, that was and I'm aware

40:52.865 --> 40:55.899
of all the times you're
describing and the camping trip.

40:55.901 --> 40:57.771
I'm just working up
to the big stuff.

41:05.110 --> 41:06.112
You're right.

41:08.347 --> 41:09.749
We gotta get into some shit.

41:22.394 --> 41:25.099
You just... you trusted me
with something, Stillman.

41:25.465 --> 41:27.932
And it really means a lot,

41:27.934 --> 41:30.070
so I kind of want
to trust you with something.

41:30.369 --> 41:32.705
Do you know what
I love about this?

41:33.706 --> 41:35.342
It means you love me
and I know it.

41:37.410 --> 41:40.010
Well, I'm glad
you feel that way.

41:40.012 --> 41:42.412
I'm just... I'm saying it's fine

41:42.414 --> 41:45.483
that you don't necessarily
say it right away.

41:45.485 --> 41:47.117
No, no, I want to say it.

41:47.119 --> 41:49.220
I just wanted to play
something for you first.

41:49.222 --> 41:51.392
I'm sorry, I'm just...
what I'm trying to say is

41:51.990 --> 41:55.158
I'm fine with you doing this
in whatever order you want.

41:55.160 --> 41:57.128
- Okay, then why are you bringing it up?
- I'm not.

41:57.130 --> 42:00.700
I'm not... I'm not gonna screw
this up by second-guessing it.

42:03.068 --> 42:05.005
You know what, I've already...
I've already blown it,

42:05.305 --> 42:07.675
so I'm just gonna
do it all again.

42:07.907 --> 42:10.341
- Do what again?
- This whole thing.

42:10.343 --> 42:12.008
Okay, you're gonna love it.

42:12.010 --> 42:13.778
I'm gonna do it
with a bunch of confidence.

42:13.780 --> 42:16.816
- It's gonna be great.
- What are you talking about?

42:28.494 --> 42:30.260
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, hi, Deb.</i>

42:30.262 --> 42:31.896
Sorry, it's Evan.

42:31.898 --> 42:32.997
- I'm looking for Stillman.
- Oh, hey, Evan.

42:32.999 --> 42:34.499
Yeah, I'll buzz you in.

42:38.872 --> 42:39.773
Hey, Still...

42:44.244 --> 42:46.244
Dude, what are you doing here?

42:46.246 --> 42:47.448
Dude, I lost my keys.

42:48.916 --> 42:51.318
- How do you lose your keys?
- The Evan I zapped into is really high.

42:51.885 --> 42:53.151
Also, he doesn't have his keys.

42:53.153 --> 42:54.484
Okay, look, I don't
have time for this.

42:54.486 --> 42:55.789
I'm in the middle
of screwing something up.

42:56.189 --> 42:57.320
- You gotta go.
- What do you mean?

42:57.322 --> 42:58.990
- Oh, hey, Evan.
- Hey.

42:58.992 --> 43:00.260
Wanna come in?

43:01.093 --> 43:03.227
No, thanks, Deb.

43:03.229 --> 43:06.830
I'm really stoned, so I don't wanna
ramble on and ruin your night.

43:06.832 --> 43:08.434
Ooh, yeah.
You got any left?

43:08.968 --> 43:12.206
Uh, good question.

43:18.410 --> 43:20.813
Your children
are gonna be so beautiful.

43:22.948 --> 43:24.184
Oh, man, that was out loud.

43:25.318 --> 43:27.220
It doesn't matter. We're doing
this all again, anyway.

43:28.220 --> 43:32.860
I don't want kids
until I've done it all.

43:33.827 --> 43:35.162
What is "it all"?

43:36.595 --> 43:41.901
All the adventures. All the mistakes.
All the cookies.

43:44.269 --> 43:48.842
- Yes, finally!
- Hey, what you doing up there? Hmm?

43:54.380 --> 43:58.381
Well, I just fixed the app

43:58.383 --> 44:00.253
that controls my time machine.

44:00.887 --> 44:03.423
Oh, a time machine. I want one.

44:04.289 --> 44:05.858
And where are we going?

44:07.059 --> 44:08.494
You're not going anywhere.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.595
Now that it's working,
Evan and I are gonna go back

44:11.597 --> 44:14.298
and redo this whole
bizarre situation.

44:14.300 --> 44:15.803
No! Why?

44:16.602 --> 44:21.104
Because I love you,
and I screwed it all up

44:21.106 --> 44:24.575
by second or third-guessing it
and that led into a fight.

44:24.577 --> 44:26.209
- And...
- An "I love you" fight.

44:26.211 --> 44:27.547
That's not a real fight.

44:30.148 --> 44:31.551
We love each other, Evan.

44:33.086 --> 44:34.251
I know.

44:34.253 --> 44:36.122
You know?
How long have you known?

44:36.990 --> 44:38.225
Um...

44:38.992 --> 44:40.526
Impossible for me to tell.

44:42.294 --> 44:43.497
A long time.

44:45.197 --> 44:46.599
Yeah, me, too.

44:50.535 --> 44:55.608
Hey, don't time travel away.
Hmm?

44:57.075 --> 45:00.447
Stay with me here in this
perfectly imperfect moment.

45:04.617 --> 45:05.619
Okay.

45:10.423 --> 45:13.124
- Yo, what the hell was that?
- I have no idea.

45:13.126 --> 45:15.992
I was sure we were toast
when the machine froze up,

45:15.994 --> 45:18.195
and it just...
it all came out beautiful.

45:18.197 --> 45:20.064
- What about the text?
- Oh, it's still there,

45:20.066 --> 45:22.432
- but we gotta be making progress, right?
- Yeah.

45:22.434 --> 45:25.303
I mean, what we did was so
much better than the original.

45:25.305 --> 45:29.240
- Oh, a hundred percent. It had to be.
- I feel like I could've said

45:29.242 --> 45:32.108
almost anything to her, and she
would've been cool with it.

45:32.110 --> 45:33.145
Good weed.

45:33.979 --> 45:35.412
I'm glad you were there,
by the way.

45:35.414 --> 45:37.715
- Yeah, you were awesome.
- Thanks, man.

45:37.717 --> 45:40.718
I'm pretty good at, like, reading vibes
and helping people out, you know?

45:40.720 --> 45:42.352
- I think that may be my thing.
- Yeah?

45:42.354 --> 45:45.523
Yeah! I mean, dude,
music theory sucks!

45:45.525 --> 45:47.258
Talk about a stupid major.

45:47.260 --> 45:49.392
I should be helping people out,
like last night.

45:49.394 --> 45:51.629
Oh, and, hey,
you know what else?

45:51.631 --> 45:53.196
I'm gonna make sure there is smoke
at each location from here on out.

45:53.198 --> 45:55.534
- That won't be necessary.
- I'll do it anyway.

Hey, do you want to go someplace
quiet where we can talk?

46:39.244 --> 46:40.380
No, thanks.

46:44.584 --> 46:46.386

47:14.680 --> 47:17.384
- Whoo!
- Thank you.

47:21.621 --> 47:23.586
Thank you.

47:23.588 --> 47:25.189
- Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

47:25.191 --> 47:26.626
- Oh!
- Whoa.

47:27.526 --> 47:29.626
- That was amazing, Debbie.
- Oh, thank you.

47:29.628 --> 47:31.562
- So awesome, Debbie.
- Thanks, guys.

47:31.564 --> 47:33.229
I know it felt really great,
but I just,

47:33.231 --> 47:35.466
like, I can't believe that
I actually did it.

47:35.468 --> 47:37.635
I can't believe we've been hiding
you behind the bar this whole time.

47:37.637 --> 47:39.702
- What, did you like it?
- Yeah. Come back Thursday.

47:39.704 --> 47:42.173
Let's put you in the weekly show, and
I'll give you a cut from the door.

47:42.175 --> 47:43.343
Oh, wow.

47:44.077 --> 47:47.244
Um, but I think... I think
I'm gonna have to pass on that.

47:47.246 --> 47:49.180
I mean, I'm just not ready,
but thank you.

47:49.182 --> 47:50.784
Okay, suit yourself.

47:52.318 --> 47:55.756
I mean, right? I'm just not feeling,
like, a weekly commitment like this.

47:58.557 --> 48:00.459
You know what?
Maybe I'm making a mistake.

48:02.695 --> 48:04.495
I mean, it felt so good
to get up there,

48:04.497 --> 48:07.200
but I feel like I need
to take a step... a step back.

48:09.434 --> 48:12.336
But maybe that's the universe
telling me not to wait

48:12.338 --> 48:13.707
and to just take a leap.

48:15.608 --> 48:17.541
I should just
trust my gut, right?

48:17.543 --> 48:19.542
That's it. That's it, Debbie,
just trust your gut.

48:19.544 --> 48:21.778
Oh, thank you for the advice.
I love you.

48:21.780 --> 48:23.749
Okay, I'm gonna get us
some drinks.

48:25.251 --> 48:26.352
That was easy.

48:27.253 --> 48:29.189
- Not the first time.
- And?

48:29.789 --> 48:31.491
Um...

48:32.291 --> 48:34.524
It's still there.
Gotta keep moving.

48:34.526 --> 48:35.394
What?

48:36.195 --> 48:38.195
Dude, my Ultimate championship
is tomorrow.

48:38.197 --> 48:39.896
You said I could win
once you get...

48:39.898 --> 48:41.765
- I'm sorry.
- That D-bag Andy's here talking shit.

48:41.767 --> 48:43.270
No, what'd he say?

48:43.668 --> 48:45.504
- Hey, fellas.
- He's so superior.

48:45.872 --> 48:47.805
- Good luck tomorrow, Evan.
- Now he's mocking me.

48:47.807 --> 48:49.874
- That's nice.
- That's not really mocking.

48:49.876 --> 48:51.742
Look, you must be close
to getting Debbie back,

48:51.744 --> 48:53.443
and I know we can't risk it
with the dumb Frisbee game,

48:53.445 --> 48:55.548
yada yada yada, but I want this.

48:55.814 --> 48:58.149
I know it's your mission
and your broken heart.

48:58.151 --> 49:01.421
I totally get it,
but I just want it.

49:06.392 --> 49:08.225
All right, screw it.

49:08.227 --> 49:09.626
- Screw it?
- Yeah.

49:09.628 --> 49:11.162
- You deserve it.
- Really?

49:11.164 --> 49:13.296
- Yeah, let's do it.
- What about her?

49:13.298 --> 49:14.631
- Any chance that...
- Don't push it.

49:14.633 --> 49:16.269
All right,
let's play some Ultimate.

50:16.329 --> 50:17.464
D up!

50:18.396 --> 50:20.631
Dude, why did you stop?

50:20.633 --> 50:22.499
- I'm just trying to get open.
- No, you got to keep streaking that way.

50:22.501 --> 50:23.669
- It goes long.
- All right.

50:23.869 --> 50:24.771
Who are you?

50:47.360 --> 50:52.265
Yes! Oh, oh, my God. Whoo!

50:52.497 --> 50:54.030
Suck it, Andy!

50:54.032 --> 50:55.968
Oh, suck it! I win.

50:56.468 --> 50:58.237
You lose. In your face.

50:58.637 --> 50:59.706
Suck it.

51:06.945 --> 51:08.044
Can I?

51:11.450 --> 51:12.352
Oh!

51:19.425 --> 51:20.760
You played your heart out.

51:23.796 --> 51:25.799
- Thanks, man.
- Ready to go?

51:26.465 --> 51:29.436
Dude, it's Blue Ribbons girl.
Oh, she's here.

51:30.635 --> 51:31.704
We're here.

51:35.740 --> 51:37.343
- Hurry up.
- You're the best.

51:43.749 --> 51:44.818
Hi.

51:45.584 --> 51:46.519
Hi.

51:47.753 --> 51:49.653
That was an amazing game.

51:49.655 --> 51:50.957
I won it for you.

51:52.590 --> 51:53.492
Really?

51:55.360 --> 51:57.463
No, not really.
That was a dumb thing to say.

51:59.398 --> 52:01.334
- What does that mean?
- Oh, nothing.

52:09.909 --> 52:11.677
God, I cannot wait
to see you naked.

52:12.945 --> 52:15.012
- You're disgusting.
- No, I know.

52:15.014 --> 52:16.582
But you won't always think so.

52:17.749 --> 52:19.585
Hey, man, let's go.
Start it up, yeah?

52:20.019 --> 52:22.689
- It's getting really weird over here.
- I can't.

52:26.124 --> 52:27.559
Will you excuse me for a sec?

52:33.131 --> 52:35.466
- What do you mean you can't?
- It's frozen.

52:35.468 --> 52:37.133
Are you kidding? 'Cause I just said
some very crude things to her.

52:37.135 --> 52:39.370
- Why?
- 'Cause I thought

52:39.372 --> 52:40.671
- I could get away with it, that's why.
- Well, I don't know.

52:40.673 --> 52:42.441
It's locked me out.

52:43.441 --> 52:45.376
The same thing happened
when I kept redoing the rooftop.

52:45.378 --> 52:47.611
- You broke our time machine?
- No, I haven't broken it, Evan.

52:47.613 --> 52:49.579
It's just not responding.

52:49.581 --> 52:51.648
- Probably because of this Frisbee game.
- So we just have to leave

52:51.650 --> 52:53.586
- that conversation the way it is?
- Well, who cares about her?

52:55.086 --> 52:56.755
No offense.

52:58.124 --> 52:59.559
Evan, look, if I don't get this
working, I'm gonna lose Debbie.

53:08.867 --> 53:09.968
It's Ryan.

53:11.169 --> 53:12.604
I'll call him back later.

53:19.945 --> 53:22.044
You don't like him, do you?

53:22.046 --> 53:24.583
- I didn't say anything.
- You didn't have to.

53:25.550 --> 53:28.053
I like Ryan, all right?
Of course I like him.

53:33.691 --> 53:35.425
Come on!

53:35.427 --> 53:37.429
Will you put your stupid
phone down for one second?

53:44.570 --> 53:45.705
I'm sorry.

53:48.773 --> 53:50.576
Come on, share.

53:53.111 --> 53:57.784
Look, he just... he seems like
he wants to hook up with you.

53:59.918 --> 54:01.553
- He's gay.
- I know.

54:02.555 --> 54:03.857
That's how he gets in so close.

54:05.957 --> 54:08.695
Well, I'm glad you told me
how you feel.

54:09.628 --> 54:10.830
Now it's out there.

54:11.130 --> 54:12.131
Yeah.

54:13.965 --> 54:15.765
Okay, Ryan has
been there for me

54:15.767 --> 54:18.771
through what were easily
the worst times of my life.

54:20.139 --> 54:21.771
So he and I share a bond

54:21.773 --> 54:25.110
that goes far deeper
than anything sexual.

54:25.878 --> 54:27.580
Oh, great.

54:30.849 --> 54:32.184
Listen to me, babe.

54:34.019 --> 54:36.022
You have to have
some faith in me.

54:38.791 --> 54:39.691
Okay?

54:41.626 --> 54:45.695
Hey, and remember he invited us
to that summer camp

54:45.697 --> 54:49.868
that someone's dad owns
or something?

54:50.802 --> 54:53.269
Anyway, we're gonna have
the whole place to ourselves

54:53.271 --> 54:55.506
and it's gonna be
an awesome blowout

54:55.508 --> 54:57.944
and I want us to just have fun!

54:58.811 --> 55:01.046
Yeah? And I don't want it
to be weird.

55:03.916 --> 55:04.851
It won't.

55:06.684 --> 55:07.753
Don't worry.

55:08.787 --> 55:09.823
Okay.

56:03.207 --> 56:05.341
- What's up, man?
- <i>Hey, dude, where are you?</i>

56:05.343 --> 56:07.213
In the library
with my new study group.

56:07.713 --> 56:09.946
Since when do you have
a study group?

56:09.948 --> 56:11.981
Since I changed my major
to psych.

56:11.983 --> 56:13.816
Hey, when you're done, do you
think I can go talk to Freud?

56:13.818 --> 56:15.721
I need some answers
I'm not getting from the text.

56:16.956 --> 56:19.892
Yeah, I can do it.
You don't know.

56:20.325 --> 56:21.925
<i>Evan, I need to talk to you.</i>

56:21.927 --> 56:23.160
Can you meet me
in front of the library

56:23.162 --> 56:25.729
- in, like, five minutes?
- That's fine.

56:25.731 --> 56:27.300
I'm pretty sure they're gonna
ask me to leave anyway.

56:29.934 --> 56:30.969
Yep, I'll be right there.

56:31.936 --> 56:33.769
Oh, I'm screwed.

56:33.771 --> 56:35.905
- Why? You said you fixed the program.
- Sort of.

56:35.907 --> 56:38.010
I can get it to move forward
and that's it.

56:39.711 --> 56:41.611
Well, okay, so then
let's just get out of here

56:41.613 --> 56:43.347
before we're stuck
in this ancient civilization.

56:43.349 --> 56:44.981
Dude, you have made
so much progress.

56:44.983 --> 56:46.649
You'll probably get back
together once we're home.

56:46.651 --> 56:48.153
Not while this
is still an issue.

56:48.887 --> 56:51.220
I gotta face this weekend
head-on.

56:51.222 --> 56:53.890
The weekend where she got down and
dirty at the sexy gay firepit rave?

56:53.892 --> 56:55.892
Exactly. Technically,
that's not what happened.

56:55.894 --> 56:58.361
It's kind of how it felt,
though.

56:58.363 --> 57:00.097
And this is all because she called you out
on being jealous of her gay best friend?

57:00.099 --> 57:01.664
- Bi best friend.
- I thought he slept with dudes?

57:01.666 --> 57:02.935
Look, you're missing the point.

57:03.901 --> 57:06.303
None of these dudes
care about gay or bi.

57:06.305 --> 57:09.071
They're just a bunch of gorgeous

57:09.073 --> 57:11.707
freethinking human beings
with a ton of glow paint,

57:11.709 --> 57:13.579
no clothes, less boundaries,

57:13.878 --> 57:17.046
and I gotta spend the weekend with
their leader, armed with nothing

57:17.048 --> 57:19.015
but a time machine
that only moves forward.

57:19.017 --> 57:21.852
So I gotta get everything right
the first time around.

57:21.854 --> 57:23.189
- Second time around.
- Whatever.

57:23.889 --> 57:27.059
Okay, so what do you have
to change about all of it?

57:28.894 --> 57:30.229
I gotta be cool with it.

57:32.965 --> 57:34.100
Yeah, you may be screwed.

57:45.878 --> 57:47.410
Hey, guys! There you are.

57:47.412 --> 57:50.949
You made it, my favorite couple!

57:52.351 --> 57:53.852
You're the sweetest.

57:54.086 --> 57:55.722
I'm so glad you guys made it.

57:56.088 --> 57:58.421
- And it's so great you guys made it work.
- Yeah?

57:58.423 --> 58:00.856
- You know? You know?
- Stop it now.

58:00.858 --> 58:03.829
Because this one can't be
with just anyone, you know?

58:04.162 --> 58:06.229
- Seriously.
- All right, stop, Ryan.

58:06.231 --> 58:09.332
No, I mean, seriously. You have
to be the right kind of man...

58:09.334 --> 58:13.736
or person, I should say...
to give her what she needs.

58:13.738 --> 58:17.039
- Aw.
- Right? Right?

58:17.041 --> 58:18.441
- Oh!
- You know?

58:18.443 --> 58:20.112
- Yeah.
- You know?

58:21.880 --> 58:24.017
Come on, man.
I'm just having some fun.

58:24.282 --> 58:27.085
Yeah. No, so am I.
Let's have fun.

58:29.088 --> 58:30.287
Excuse me.

58:30.289 --> 58:32.088
- I should...
- Oh, would you?

58:32.090 --> 58:33.291
- Of course.
- Great.

58:36.294 --> 58:38.398
- Well?
- Shall we party?

58:39.197 --> 58:41.198
Ah!

58:41.200 --> 58:42.435
That never sucks less.

59:01.986 --> 59:04.387
- What's up, man?
- <i>Yo, I have no idea where I am right now.</i>

59:04.389 --> 59:07.224
I'm in a completely empty apartment
that I've never seen before.

59:07.226 --> 59:10.160
You're probably in a new event.
Something we didn't do last time.

59:10.162 --> 59:12.762
Something that's happening
because of the changes we made?

59:12.764 --> 59:15.932
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Wait,
does nothing look familiar?

59:15.934 --> 59:17.003
Uh-uh.

59:18.204 --> 59:20.406
There's just a lone box on
the floor in front of me.

59:20.838 --> 59:21.940
<i>Well, what's in it?</i>

59:22.775 --> 59:24.177
I'm kind of scared to open it.

59:24.977 --> 59:28.010
- Oh, what's in the box?
- What's in the box?

59:28.012 --> 59:31.381
- What's in the box?
- You know what? Relax.

59:31.383 --> 59:33.886
- <i>It'll all come to you in a second.</i>
- How's it going over there?

59:34.186 --> 59:36.986
Fabulously.
You wanna come back me up?

59:36.988 --> 59:38.789
Man, if I'm serious
about Evan improvement,

59:38.791 --> 59:40.959
I gotta be more selective
about how I spend my time.

59:41.325 --> 59:44.030
It's fine. I've come too far.

59:47.800 --> 59:49.332
Hi.

59:49.334 --> 59:50.867
Holy crap, dude.
It's Blue Ribbons girl.

59:50.869 --> 59:52.334
I wonder if we're dating.

59:52.336 --> 59:53.905
What do you think her real name is?
I gotta go.

59:59.110 --> 01:00:01.945
- So, you just let them touch you all over?
- Well, we're dancing.

01:00:01.947 --> 01:00:03.847
- Yeah, we were dancing.
- That's not dancing.

01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:05.215
- I was just having fun. It's a party!
- They were...

01:00:05.217 --> 01:00:06.952
<i>So what,
you want to go home?</i>

01:00:08.486 --> 01:00:10.756
Come on, man. Too close.

01:00:18.162 --> 01:00:20.432
Rebecca had to take off
'cause of the rain.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:24.070
Do you think you can handle
the couch by yourself?

01:00:25.604 --> 01:00:27.173
Of course.

01:00:27.606 --> 01:00:29.142
Thank you so much.

01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:33.278
You're moving! I'm helping.

01:00:34.278 --> 01:00:37.115
- You sure are.
- Totally. One couch coming up.

01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:44.456
Hey, where'd
Stillman run off to?

01:00:55.601 --> 01:00:56.501
Hey!

01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:58.968
What's he doing?

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:00.503
- His thing.
- Debbie, Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.

01:01:00.505 --> 01:01:02.338
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.

01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:04.006
Debbie, Deb, Debbie,
Debbie, Debbie.

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:05.908
Oh, Debbie, Debbie,
Debbie, Debbie, Debbie.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:08.414
Come on, come on, come on.
Where's the music?

01:01:09.113 --> 01:01:12.083
Fire. Fire. Yeah!

01:02:36.068 --> 01:02:40.006
Honestly,
I feel like I belong here

01:02:40.305 --> 01:02:41.640
and that's all Debbie.

01:02:42.206 --> 01:02:44.106
I used to hate parties.

01:02:44.108 --> 01:02:46.508
I didn't know where to stand
or who to talk to.

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:48.044
Totally.

01:02:48.046 --> 01:02:49.582
But she showed me
it doesn't matter.

01:02:50.247 --> 01:02:51.648
Especially with you guys.

01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:53.716
Like, it's just cool
to hang out anywhere

01:02:53.718 --> 01:02:55.285
and be with anyone.

01:02:55.287 --> 01:02:57.220
I am so glad you feel that way.

01:02:57.222 --> 01:03:00.191
Now, would you mind leaving
so we could, you know, hook up?

01:03:04.095 --> 01:03:07.099
Oh, yeah. Yeah, totally.

01:03:08.066 --> 01:03:09.135
Totally.

01:03:09.534 --> 01:03:12.371
My mistake. Have fun.

01:03:14.773 --> 01:03:16.338
There you are.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.343
- You ready for bed?
- No.

01:03:20.012 --> 01:03:21.514
I don't want this party to end.

01:03:23.014 --> 01:03:24.316
You wanna go for a swim?

01:03:27.084 --> 01:03:29.220
There's, like, No Swimming signs
all over the place.

01:03:29.588 --> 01:03:32.158
Yeah, no, I saw those.
Maybe we shouldn't.

01:03:32.691 --> 01:03:35.227
- I'm sure it will be fine.
- It looks cold.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.626
Yeah, well, they say
it's basically melted snow

01:03:37.628 --> 01:03:39.262
coming down off the mountain,

01:03:39.264 --> 01:03:40.662
so I'm sure it's gonna be,
like, a little...

01:03:43.535 --> 01:03:45.204
- No, I'm good.
- Oh.

01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.640
Oh, my God!

01:03:50.642 --> 01:03:52.508
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, I'm gonna do it!

01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:53.642
- It's so cold!
- I'm gonna jump in!

01:03:53.644 --> 01:03:55.044
- I'm gonna do it!
- It's so cold!

01:03:55.046 --> 01:03:56.312
- I'm gonna do it!
- No, don't do it!

01:03:56.314 --> 01:03:58.180
No, no, no, don't,
don't come in.

01:03:58.182 --> 01:03:59.251
Oh, my God!

01:04:00.552 --> 01:04:02.619
- That was insane!
- I'm so cold!

01:04:02.621 --> 01:04:05.088
Ah, it's so much colder
than it looks!

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:06.691
I can't believe
you just did that.

01:04:07.159 --> 01:04:09.494
I'm just having fun.

01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:13.465
Well, your lips are blue,
but are you having fun?

01:04:13.697 --> 01:04:15.564
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:04:15.566 --> 01:04:17.166
- This is the best party ever.
- Oh, good, I was worried.

01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:19.234
It's kind of crazy.

01:04:19.236 --> 01:04:21.407
You know my saying. You gotta...
you gotta go with the flow.

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.376
Do you say that?

01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:26.512
- Oh.
- I'm trying it out.

01:04:28.146 --> 01:04:29.381
Well, I like it.

01:04:32.084 --> 01:04:34.517
Oh, my God, they're actually, like, frozen.
We have to get you inside.

01:04:34.519 --> 01:04:35.755
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

01:05:11.889 --> 01:05:12.824
Yes!

01:05:35.780 --> 01:05:40.119
Whoo! Yeah!

01:05:41.686 --> 01:05:44.155
Ah!

01:05:45.456 --> 01:05:46.923
You are so sweet to do this.

01:05:46.925 --> 01:05:49.662
- Yeah!
- Sorry it went so late.

01:05:52.597 --> 01:05:55.468
You know, I didn't like you
when we first met.

01:05:55.901 --> 01:05:57.570
Yeah, I know.

01:05:58.503 --> 01:06:01.740
And I realize I have done a whole
lot to try to win you over.

01:06:02.474 --> 01:06:03.476
Maybe.

01:06:04.843 --> 01:06:05.878
Maybe?

01:06:11.715 --> 01:06:13.585
You should get that
wheezing looked at

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.622
What?

01:06:17.923 --> 01:06:19.555
- What's up?
- Dude, we did it.

01:06:19.557 --> 01:06:21.490
- The text is gone.
- We did it?

01:06:21.492 --> 01:06:23.725
That's fantastic, man!
All right!

01:06:23.727 --> 01:06:25.227
All right,
I'm getting us out of here.

01:06:25.229 --> 01:06:26.331
Great work.

01:06:28.432 --> 01:06:30.399
So I was gonna check out
my new shower.

01:06:30.401 --> 01:06:32.470
- Okay.
- Wanna join me?

01:06:40.378 --> 01:06:42.245
No. No, no, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

01:06:42.247 --> 01:06:43.282
Wait, wait, wait, Stillman.

01:06:47.885 --> 01:06:50.588
- That's it?
- Oh, man!

01:06:50.921 --> 01:06:52.722
- This is it.
- You gotta send me back.

01:06:52.724 --> 01:06:54.591
- We did it.
- Stillman, you gotta send me back

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:55.490
- to Blue Ribbons right now.
- What are you talking about?

01:06:55.492 --> 01:06:56.528
We did it.

01:06:57.762 --> 01:07:00.262
- We did it.
- Okay, we did it.

01:07:00.264 --> 01:07:01.497
- We totally did it.
- Yeah!

01:07:01.499 --> 01:07:03.269
You did it. I did it.

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:05.901
I did some major Evan redesign,
right?

01:07:05.903 --> 01:07:07.206
Oh, let me see.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.874
No. No!

01:07:11.876 --> 01:07:13.312
No, are you kidding?

01:07:14.445 --> 01:07:15.648
I'm sorry, man.

01:07:16.948 --> 01:07:18.349
That's it, I'm taking the time
machine back to the shower.

01:07:19.651 --> 01:07:22.221
- Time...
- It's gone.

01:07:23.755 --> 01:07:24.789
It's all gone.

01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:27.293
Wait, why?

01:07:28.927 --> 01:07:30.526
Because we never break up.

01:07:30.528 --> 01:07:32.765
We don't break up,
I don't build it.

01:07:33.697 --> 01:07:35.564
All the changes we've made
caught up to us

01:07:35.566 --> 01:07:37.202
when we jumped forward.

01:07:37.468 --> 01:07:39.501
This trip was a massive rip!

01:07:39.503 --> 01:07:42.674
No! What? We got her back, man.

01:07:43.441 --> 01:07:45.744
And I could not have done this
without you.

01:07:46.378 --> 01:07:47.947
I hope that counts
for something.

01:07:50.414 --> 01:07:51.382
Yeah.

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.452
Yeah, okay.

01:07:56.287 --> 01:07:57.389
Call her.

01:08:00.691 --> 01:08:01.659
Yeah.

01:08:09.867 --> 01:08:11.334
It's ringing.

01:08:11.336 --> 01:08:12.972
- <i>Hey.</i>
- Hey.

01:08:13.537 --> 01:08:14.673
<i>What's up?</i>

01:08:16.508 --> 01:08:18.443
Nothing,
I'm just calling to say hi.

01:08:19.009 --> 01:08:20.245
<i>Hi.</i>

01:08:21.312 --> 01:08:24.546
<i>Was that it or did you have
something else?</i>

01:08:24.549 --> 01:08:27.519
It's just... it's just good
to hear your voice.

01:08:27.751 --> 01:08:29.385
Nice.

01:08:29.386 --> 01:08:30.488
<i>You wanna come over
and hang out?</i>

01:08:31.388 --> 01:08:35.460
Yes, yes, yes,
I'll be over very soon.

01:08:36.094 --> 01:08:37.462
Okay, bye-bye.

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:42.934
Okay. I was nervous.

01:08:43.934 --> 01:08:45.303
No more redos.

01:08:50.008 --> 01:08:51.010
Okay.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:14.299
Hi.

01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:17.832
- Hi.
- Debbie.

01:09:17.835 --> 01:09:18.836
Hey.

01:09:19.837 --> 01:09:23.075
Oh. I love you so much.

01:09:24.108 --> 01:09:25.544
I love you, too.

01:09:26.844 --> 01:09:28.313
Hey, what's wrong?

01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.349
Nothing. Oh!

01:09:31.982 --> 01:09:33.451
Everything's perfect.

01:09:33.684 --> 01:09:35.015
Yeah?

01:09:35.018 --> 01:09:37.322
- I wanna make love to you.
- Oh, okay.

01:09:57.842 --> 01:09:59.745
- You wanna order?
- Mmm.

01:10:00.577 --> 01:10:01.843
That would be amazing.

01:10:01.845 --> 01:10:03.648
Yeah? Okay.

01:10:06.049 --> 01:10:09.520
You know, I could lay here
with you forever.

01:10:10.522 --> 01:10:11.823
Order extra then.

01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:18.062
Hey, are we still gonna see that
samurai movie for your birthday?

01:10:19.563 --> 01:10:23.501
You know, I was thinking we could
do something a bit more special.

01:10:23.934 --> 01:10:27.803
Maybe dinner
at the Maddox House.

01:10:27.805 --> 01:10:29.808
Ooh, fancy.

01:10:31.209 --> 01:10:34.046
- Just us or with other people?
- Just us.

01:10:34.612 --> 01:10:36.044
Okay.

01:10:36.046 --> 01:10:38.150
I wanna spend my birthday
with my favorite person.

01:10:39.517 --> 01:10:40.753
That would be perfect.

01:10:56.768 --> 01:10:58.804
- There you are.
- Sorry I'm late.

01:10:59.170 --> 01:11:00.839
They gave our table away.

01:11:01.738 --> 01:11:03.040
What, after five minutes?

01:11:03.508 --> 01:11:06.144
After an hour and five minutes.

01:11:07.245 --> 01:11:08.714
Reservation was at 8:00.

01:11:09.246 --> 01:11:12.181
- Oh, God, so sorry.
- Yeah, I texted you.

01:11:12.183 --> 01:11:14.720
- You know, eight o'clock.
- Oh, my phone died.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.889
Why wasn't it charged?

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:20.155
Forgot. You know,
I figured it didn't matter

01:11:20.157 --> 01:11:23.161
because my only responsibility
was to meet you here at 9:00.

01:11:23.661 --> 01:11:26.965
- 8:00.
- Oh, I know. I'm sorry. I know.

01:11:27.732 --> 01:11:29.535
You wanna go sit at the bar?

01:11:29.933 --> 01:11:34.136
There isn't a bar.
And I am super hungry.

01:11:34.138 --> 01:11:38.210
Like same hunger level
as Marvin?

01:11:39.611 --> 01:11:40.813
Starvin'?

01:11:43.013 --> 01:11:44.048
No?

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:47.919
So hangry hungry?

01:11:49.286 --> 01:11:51.887
Please say what you're feeling.

01:11:51.889 --> 01:11:56.225
Well, okay, I feel like you
should've been on time for dinner.

01:11:56.227 --> 01:11:58.927
Yes, I get that,
and I apologize...

01:11:58.929 --> 01:12:02.030
I feel it's super simple
to keep your phone charged

01:12:02.032 --> 01:12:06.068
so then you can be on time for
special events like birthdays

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:08.840
and then I'm not
the only one working on...

01:12:10.909 --> 01:12:12.173
What, this relationship?

01:12:12.175 --> 01:12:13.909
- Is that what you think?
- No. No.

01:12:13.911 --> 01:12:16.145
- It's...
- Listen, I'm not sure

01:12:16.147 --> 01:12:19.248
what you meant by that,
but it kind of sounds like

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:22.754
you're tapping into something
that is no longer about dinner.

01:12:23.054 --> 01:12:25.157
I'm sorry. Okay, I'm tired.

01:12:26.624 --> 01:12:29.728
I just... I just wanted this
to be a perfect evening.

01:12:34.698 --> 01:12:36.201
It still can be.

01:12:37.969 --> 01:12:40.770
Come on, why don't
we just go for a wander

01:12:40.772 --> 01:12:44.142
and see if we can find
a cool, little spot, hmm?

01:12:57.722 --> 01:12:59.754
Oh, here it is.

01:12:59.756 --> 01:13:01.324
Hey, we should...
should we sing?

01:13:01.326 --> 01:13:02.761
We should sing for him, right?

01:13:03.594 --> 01:13:04.595
No?

01:13:05.729 --> 01:13:06.932
Make a wish.

01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:10.568
You didn't close your eyes.
You have to close your eyes.

01:13:11.235 --> 01:13:13.738
Otherwise the wish
doesn't come true, you know?

01:13:14.906 --> 01:13:16.338
You wanna do it again?

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.074
Dude, that sounds like
the worst birthday

01:13:18.076 --> 01:13:20.309
since the year my mom
hooked up with that clown.

01:13:20.311 --> 01:13:22.648
I just wish I didn't get so mad.

01:13:23.113 --> 01:13:25.314
Well, why not?
I mean, she messed up.

01:13:25.316 --> 01:13:27.016
- Didn't she?
- Yeah.

01:13:27.018 --> 01:13:29.318
Yeah, but it was
our first big night together

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:31.654
since we got back,
and I just feel crappy.

01:13:31.656 --> 01:13:33.759
Hey, you're together,
aren't you?

01:13:34.659 --> 01:13:36.094
At least you made
this year better.

01:13:37.228 --> 01:13:40.061
Oh, well, you graduated,
didn't you?

01:13:40.063 --> 01:13:42.066
I still work at a freaking
Price-N-Nice!

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.668
I gotta be careful
how loudly I scream that.

01:13:45.670 --> 01:13:48.307
Dude, you did a few sit-ups,
and you changed your major.

01:13:49.206 --> 01:13:51.106
- What did you expect?
- Something cooler

01:13:51.108 --> 01:13:53.074
to come from
traveling through time.

01:13:53.076 --> 01:13:55.077
Cooler than winning
your Ultimate Frisbee league?

01:13:55.079 --> 01:13:56.846
Yes!

01:13:56.848 --> 01:13:58.913
- I told you going into this that...
- I know.

01:13:58.915 --> 01:14:01.883
I know, but I was thinking that
maybe another time adventure.

01:14:01.885 --> 01:14:04.990
- This one a little more Evan-centric...
- No, there is no...

01:14:05.356 --> 01:14:07.722
The machine is gone.
The machine is gone.

01:14:07.724 --> 01:14:09.225
- What does that even mean? Draw it up.
- Do you understand? I can't.

01:14:09.227 --> 01:14:10.659
- We hop back. We hop back out.
- It is gone!

01:14:10.661 --> 01:14:12.293
The machine is not there
forever.

01:14:12.295 --> 01:14:13.331
Yeah, yeah.

01:14:14.433 --> 01:14:16.802
Don't you go obsessing
about it either then, all right?

01:14:17.035 --> 01:14:18.236
Fights happen all the time.

01:14:20.237 --> 01:14:21.205
Evan?

01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:27.112
Not again.

01:14:29.046 --> 01:14:31.047
All right, now,
what do I always say?

01:14:31.049 --> 01:14:33.215
Price-N-Nice is not
just a job, it's a...

01:14:33.217 --> 01:14:34.449
Burden.

01:14:34.451 --> 01:14:36.088
- Family. I say family.
- Family.

01:17:09.307 --> 01:17:11.039
Yeah, dude, that's what I said.

01:17:11.041 --> 01:17:12.106
Okay.

01:17:17.214 --> 01:17:20.114
I would like to make
a toast to great friends.

01:17:20.116 --> 01:17:21.950
- Thank you for coming.
- Whoo!

01:17:21.952 --> 01:17:23.254
Debbie and I are lucky
to have you.

01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:31.028
Oh, hey, get ready 'cause literally
every meal Debbie makes is perfect.

01:17:31.295 --> 01:17:33.532
Well, whatever we're having
smells amazing.

01:17:34.932 --> 01:17:36.367
Oh, crap! Crap!

01:17:38.603 --> 01:17:40.405
- Excuse me.
- Crap.

01:17:44.875 --> 01:17:47.543
- Oh, no!
- It was only supposed to be in 15 minutes.

01:17:47.545 --> 01:17:48.977
How long has it been in there?

01:17:48.979 --> 01:17:52.017
An hour,
give or take 15 minutes.

01:17:54.652 --> 01:17:56.051
What happened?

01:17:56.053 --> 01:17:57.586
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:17:57.588 --> 01:17:59.555
I guess I must've just
spaced out.

01:17:59.557 --> 01:18:01.390
So much for the perfect meal.

01:18:01.392 --> 01:18:03.094
God, I'm so stupid.

01:18:04.061 --> 01:18:08.200
How can I help? Debbie knows
I'm no slouch in the kitchen.

01:18:09.032 --> 01:18:10.602
Shut up, Ryan.

01:18:12.969 --> 01:18:14.171
Stillman!

01:18:44.134 --> 01:18:48.205
- The salmon go in?
- Hmm? Oh, yeah, just now.

01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:51.209
Great.

01:18:51.575 --> 01:18:54.142
- That was amazing.
- Such a perfect night, man.

01:18:54.144 --> 01:18:55.276
Thanks.

01:18:55.278 --> 01:18:57.145
- Allison's great.
- I know!

01:18:57.147 --> 01:18:58.883
- Right?
- I'm happy for you.

01:19:01.352 --> 01:19:02.888
You look tired, my friend.

01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:05.087
Get some rest.

01:19:05.089 --> 01:19:07.959
Yeah, well,
we got a big day Monday.

01:19:09.293 --> 01:19:11.392
Debbie's recording
her first album.

01:19:11.394 --> 01:19:14.529
What? Debbie, that rocks.
When did this happen?

01:19:14.531 --> 01:19:16.998
Yeah, sorry,
it all happened so fast.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.101
I completely forgot
to mention it.

01:19:19.103 --> 01:19:22.538
Yesterday, I got the most
random series of phone calls.

01:19:22.540 --> 01:19:24.509
No, but it was your talent
that made it happen.

01:19:25.142 --> 01:19:26.111
Remember that.

01:19:27.378 --> 01:19:30.346
- Yeah.
- <i>"Every day just feels the same.</i>

01:19:30.348 --> 01:19:31.983
And my heart has gotten
in the way.

01:19:32.650 --> 01:19:36.955
Every day just feels the same.
And I'm sorry that we came.

01:19:37.487 --> 01:19:41.558
Every day just feels the same.
And I cannot place the blame."

01:19:43.527 --> 01:19:46.531
- What do you think?
- Yes, it's good.

01:19:48.631 --> 01:19:51.566
I'm not sure about this,
Stillman.

01:19:51.568 --> 01:19:53.267
You're not sure about what?

01:19:53.269 --> 01:19:57.142
You know, my music.
Recording. The whole thing.

01:19:57.607 --> 01:20:00.042
Are you nervous?

01:20:00.044 --> 01:20:02.144
If you're nervous, I'm certain I can
get you some more time to prepare.

01:20:02.146 --> 01:20:03.447
You could? How?

01:20:04.281 --> 01:20:05.646
I don't...
I mean, I don't know for sure.

01:20:05.648 --> 01:20:07.718
No, I'm not nervous.

01:20:08.786 --> 01:20:10.021
It's just, like...

01:20:11.688 --> 01:20:13.624
I don't care, honestly.

01:20:14.692 --> 01:20:16.962
- About recording?
- About any of it.

01:20:17.527 --> 01:20:20.128
You know, music was such
a big part of my life

01:20:20.130 --> 01:20:22.096
and even though I was shy,
I still wanted to do it

01:20:22.098 --> 01:20:23.668
to see how good I could be.

01:20:24.802 --> 01:20:26.271
And now?

01:20:37.048 --> 01:20:40.085
Stillman, do you think it's
strange that we never fight?

01:20:40.384 --> 01:20:43.588
- What?
- Me and you, we never fight.

01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:46.555
- Do I think that's strange?
- Mmm.

01:20:46.557 --> 01:20:49.690
No. No, I think it's awesome,
you know,

01:20:49.692 --> 01:20:51.362
we get along so well.

01:20:51.661 --> 01:20:53.828
No, I'm not talking about
getting along.

01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:59.403
I mean, we've never even... we
never even disagree on anything.

01:21:00.204 --> 01:21:03.508
Is this serious? Or is there
something else bothering you?

01:21:04.107 --> 01:21:05.673
No, this is serious.

01:21:05.675 --> 01:21:08.146
You know, I honestly think
we'd be better off if we fought.

01:21:09.647 --> 01:21:11.082
I don't know.

01:21:11.682 --> 01:21:13.585
Maybe there's just
something wrong with me.

01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:33.705
Always returning to the breath
with compassion for ourselves.

01:21:40.478 --> 01:21:43.345
If you find yourself
distracted by the outside world

01:21:43.347 --> 01:21:45.183
simply return to the breath.

01:21:46.150 --> 01:21:49.219
And if a thought
seems particularly important

01:21:49.753 --> 01:21:50.621
just let it go.

01:21:51.522 --> 01:21:54.726
Knowing that
it can probably wait till later.

01:21:59.429 --> 01:22:00.863
So why don't we try to
maintain this space

01:22:00.865 --> 01:22:04.269
for the next five...
next 15 minutes?

01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:08.436
What's wrong with you?

01:22:08.438 --> 01:22:09.573
- I need help.
- Tell me.

01:22:10.607 --> 01:22:12.776
Something is wrong with Debbie.
She's changed.

01:22:13.510 --> 01:22:15.409
Okay, it is perfectly normal
for things

01:22:15.411 --> 01:22:17.346
to slow down in the bedroom
after marriage.

01:22:17.348 --> 01:22:19.150
- You can't take it personally.
- No, that's not why I'm here.

01:22:20.183 --> 01:22:22.086
She's not who she used to be.

01:22:22.419 --> 01:22:23.321
How so?

01:22:25.622 --> 01:22:29.824
Well, you remember
the time machine I invented?

01:22:29.826 --> 01:22:31.659
No!

01:22:31.661 --> 01:22:33.261
- I thought that was gone.
- Well, I built another one.

01:22:33.263 --> 01:22:34.762
How'd you do that?

01:22:34.764 --> 01:22:36.832
- Well, I still know the theorem.
- And you're using it?

01:22:36.834 --> 01:22:39.668
All the time.
Like, all the time.

01:22:39.670 --> 01:22:41.770
Last night I went back in time
to make the bed.

01:22:41.772 --> 01:22:43.739
- That's not good.
- She wasn't even home yet.

01:22:43.741 --> 01:22:45.740
I could've gone upstairs
to make the bed,

01:22:45.742 --> 01:22:48.243
- but I used the time machine.
- So cut yourself off.

01:22:48.245 --> 01:22:53.215
I would, but I'm telling you
Debbie's not even Debbie anymore.

01:22:53.217 --> 01:22:54.783
She doesn't even
care about music.

01:22:54.785 --> 01:22:57.655
She never plays.
She hardly even laughs.

01:22:58.522 --> 01:23:00.321
I've been redoing everything
so many times,

01:23:00.323 --> 01:23:02.727
I swear it's starting
to have an effect on her.

01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:06.761
- Well, people change, Stillman.
- That's your advice?

01:23:06.763 --> 01:23:08.896
- Well, what did you expect?
- I don't know.

01:23:08.898 --> 01:23:11.466
- I gotta destroy the machine or else...
- Whoa, slow down a second.

01:23:11.468 --> 01:23:14.502
You're getting hysterical. Look,
no relationships are perfect.

01:23:14.504 --> 01:23:15.971
They all require work.

01:23:15.973 --> 01:23:18.610
- Metaphysical work?
- No, my point is

01:23:18.976 --> 01:23:21.243
you should try to appreciate
what you do have,

01:23:21.245 --> 01:23:22.677
what the both of you have.

01:23:22.679 --> 01:23:24.548
It's probably way better
than you realize.

01:23:25.915 --> 01:23:27.217
I don't know, man.

01:23:28.852 --> 01:23:31.622
I'm not even sure
what we have anymore.

01:23:43.299 --> 01:23:45.335
I wish I knew
how to make you happy.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:54.611
Maybe we should have a baby.

01:23:57.348 --> 01:23:58.349
What?

01:23:59.582 --> 01:24:02.887
But we have a plan.
This is your plan.

01:24:04.254 --> 01:24:07.922
We focus on your music
and then we travel, then kids.

01:24:07.924 --> 01:24:09.561
So let's do it out of order.

01:24:10.294 --> 01:24:13.564
You know, maybe that's why
I've been feeling so lost.

01:24:13.863 --> 01:24:16.998
We need something to give us purpose
and music clearly isn't it,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.735
and instead of moving on
to some new thing,

01:24:19.737 --> 01:24:22.671
maybe if we, you know,
grew our family,

01:24:22.673 --> 01:24:26.376
we'd have that energy, the
motion that we've been lacking.

01:24:32.549 --> 01:24:34.319
I guess we could consider it.

01:24:35.419 --> 01:24:36.955
I really think it could work.

01:24:47.697 --> 01:24:49.267
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

01:25:35.778 --> 01:25:37.948
You deserve
so much better than this.

01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:00.705
Hey. Hi.

01:26:01.804 --> 01:26:04.506
Hey, bud, you wanna go
for a run or something?

01:26:04.508 --> 01:26:06.007
You know,
I'm super busy this morning.

01:26:06.009 --> 01:26:08.377
- Okay.
- I'll call you later.

01:26:08.379 --> 01:26:10.111
Yeah, listen, I've been thinking about
your situation if you wanna talk it over.

01:26:10.113 --> 01:26:12.980
No, I gotta...
I got a lot of things going on.

01:26:12.982 --> 01:26:14.048
- I gotta go.
- You gotta do what?

01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:15.687
I gotta... I gotta go, Evan.

01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:18.856
Please don't destroy it!

01:26:31.134 --> 01:26:32.469
What do you care?

01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:35.840
I just don't think
you should do anything drastic.

01:26:42.079 --> 01:26:44.448
Look, this isn't just about you,
all right?

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:47.352
How long?

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:50.722
Since we got back.

01:26:51.722 --> 01:26:53.154
I knew you wouldn't
be able to live without it,

01:26:53.156 --> 01:26:55.759
so I just, like,
I kept an eye on you.

01:26:58.661 --> 01:27:00.962
- How did you even get in?
- That sliding glass door thing's

01:27:00.964 --> 01:27:03.434
- usually open.
- And I never catch you?

01:27:03.767 --> 01:27:06.604
- You catch me all the time.
- Right, yeah, of course.

01:27:09.205 --> 01:27:11.138
- We're both hooked.
- I'm not hooked, all right?

01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.740
I just happen to find it
very useful.

01:27:12.742 --> 01:27:14.609
Look, I give a lot of people
advice, man.

01:27:14.611 --> 01:27:16.177
And frankly,
I'm not very good at it yet.

01:27:16.179 --> 01:27:18.648
So the time machine helps.
Like, a lot.

01:27:21.751 --> 01:27:23.217
- I'm sorry, Evan.
- No, Stillman! Stillman!

01:27:23.219 --> 01:27:24.653
I gotta end it.

01:27:26.522 --> 01:27:28.023
Okay.

01:27:28.025 --> 01:27:29.660
- Who's at the door?
- No, ignore it.

01:27:37.901 --> 01:27:39.003
It's just Evan.

01:27:43.072 --> 01:27:44.575
What is going on?

01:27:51.848 --> 01:27:53.418
Stillman, no. No, wait.

01:27:59.522 --> 01:28:02.058
- Ow! What are you doing?
- Stopping you!

01:28:02.558 --> 01:28:03.660
From what?

01:28:04.527 --> 01:28:06.026
Oh, I thought you were
gonna, like,

01:28:06.028 --> 01:28:07.732
go back in time
and uninvent the time machine.

01:28:08.264 --> 01:28:09.967
- No.
- Oh.

01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:14.002
Wait, that is
what you're gonna do.

01:28:14.004 --> 01:28:16.504
Stillman! Listen. Okay, listen.

01:28:16.506 --> 01:28:18.172
We both got
what we wanted, right?

01:28:18.174 --> 01:28:20.775
So let's destroy this machine
and move on with our lives

01:28:20.777 --> 01:28:21.909
as they are right now.

01:28:21.911 --> 01:28:23.780
I still know the theorem.

01:28:24.548 --> 01:28:26.717
If I destroy this machine,
I'll make another one.

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:29.486
I have to quit, cold turkey.

01:28:30.019 --> 01:28:32.587
I have to let her go,
and the only way to do that

01:28:32.589 --> 01:28:34.088
is to go back to the beginning.

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:35.793
Of time?

01:28:36.759 --> 01:28:37.928
The day you hit me.

01:28:38.528 --> 01:28:40.697
If I don't get hit,
there's no theorem.

01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:42.963
There's no theorem,
there's no machine.

01:28:42.965 --> 01:28:44.869
- None of this.
- And that will be it?

01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:47.101
For me and Allison
and my students?

01:28:47.103 --> 01:28:48.539
My days with Lord Buddha?

01:28:49.138 --> 01:28:50.971
- Lord Buddha?
- I think it was him.

01:28:50.973 --> 01:28:52.809
It could've just been, like,
a super nice Indian dude.

01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:54.809
Well, that's amazing, Evan.

01:28:54.811 --> 01:28:57.514
I have a ton of questions
about that, but... no.

01:28:58.247 --> 01:29:00.585
No, anything we got
from the machine would be gone.

01:29:01.919 --> 01:29:03.086
I'm sorry.

01:29:05.856 --> 01:29:07.925
- I'm not going back.
- You're not?

01:29:08.224 --> 01:29:09.861
What, you're gonna fight me?

01:29:10.093 --> 01:29:12.026
I thought you were enlightened.

01:29:12.028 --> 01:29:14.064
- I'm not that fucking enlightened.
- What is going on?

01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:18.870
What is that?

01:29:21.170 --> 01:29:22.106
Evan?

01:29:24.174 --> 01:29:25.610
It's a time machine, Debbie.

01:29:26.911 --> 01:29:28.913
I'm gonna destroy it, and that
will keep you guys together.

01:29:39.156 --> 01:29:40.558
A time machine?

01:29:43.727 --> 01:29:44.961
I made it for you.

01:29:51.701 --> 01:29:57.073
So that night that we hung out

01:29:57.941 --> 01:30:00.911
and you talked about
traveling in time.

01:30:02.379 --> 01:30:03.948
That was true.

01:30:06.015 --> 01:30:07.552
From then till now?

01:30:08.684 --> 01:30:10.187
A lot of work getting it right.

01:30:11.388 --> 01:30:13.954
- This explains so much.
- I know.

01:30:13.956 --> 01:30:16.026
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

01:30:17.361 --> 01:30:19.597
This is why we don't fight!

01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:23.567
This is why I don't
care about anything!

01:30:24.768 --> 01:30:28.005
I wasn't me and you weren't you and
this has all just been bullshit!

01:30:28.338 --> 01:30:31.608
Technically, I'm not sure
how you noticed anything.

01:30:32.009 --> 01:30:34.979
- And that made it okay?
- It was a simple enough theory!

01:30:36.412 --> 01:30:40.151
Eliminate all the times you were
unhappy and then you would be happy.

01:30:41.351 --> 01:30:42.786
Super scientific.

01:30:45.155 --> 01:30:46.256
How long?

01:30:49.058 --> 01:30:52.195
In total years, not that long.

01:30:54.697 --> 01:30:57.968
60, 70 years.

01:30:59.936 --> 01:31:01.170
Give or take a decade.

01:31:05.041 --> 01:31:06.977
What a horrific invention.

01:31:07.878 --> 01:31:08.879
I know.

01:31:10.312 --> 01:31:13.347
That's why I have to go back
and make sure

01:31:13.349 --> 01:31:15.719
none of this ever happens.

01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.357
And you'll be free.

01:31:23.693 --> 01:31:24.859
Get your head out of there, bud.

01:31:24.861 --> 01:31:26.731
Ah!

01:31:42.179 --> 01:31:44.015
This is who you really are, man.

01:31:45.182 --> 01:31:48.019
Your life's gonna turn out just
fine without a time machine.

01:31:48.218 --> 01:31:49.754
I promise.

01:31:56.425 --> 01:31:57.827
I'm so sorry.

01:32:00.129 --> 01:32:01.297
I love you.

01:32:05.402 --> 01:32:08.368
I can't believe
you're gonna do this to me!

01:32:08.370 --> 01:32:09.803
Stillman, you're gonna
leave me here...

01:32:11.508 --> 01:32:12.977
Oh!

01:32:27.523 --> 01:32:29.293
Wait, hey.
Wait, where are you going?

01:32:48.778 --> 01:32:50.013
I wish I had believed you.

01:32:58.988 --> 01:33:00.555
Sorry.

01:33:00.557 --> 01:33:02.023
- What are you doing?
- I gotta hit you with the car

01:33:02.025 --> 01:33:03.557
so you'll come up with
the thing.

01:33:03.559 --> 01:33:04.793
- That's ridiculous.
- You know what's ridiculous?

01:33:04.795 --> 01:33:06.160
Wearing a uniform to work.

01:33:06.162 --> 01:33:07.462
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm not kidding.

01:33:07.464 --> 01:33:08.899
I felt like an idiot
in that thing.

01:33:10.866 --> 01:33:13.168
This would be a lot safer
if you just stand still.

01:33:13.170 --> 01:33:14.305
No!

01:33:16.106 --> 01:33:17.971
- Stillman.
- Look, this isn't even gonna work.

01:33:17.973 --> 01:33:21.044
You don't know that. It's gonna
work out great for everyone.

01:33:26.482 --> 01:33:28.151
Ah.

01:33:28.518 --> 01:33:30.051
- Evan...
- Would you just...

01:33:30.053 --> 01:33:31.218
Could you just wait
there for a sec?

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:33.053
- No, this isn't...
- Just wait there

01:33:33.055 --> 01:33:35.025
- for a minute, all right?
- This is embarrassing, man.

01:33:35.558 --> 01:33:36.893
All right, come on.

01:33:41.097 --> 01:33:43.099
Oh, Jesus. Oh.

01:33:51.241 --> 01:33:53.173
If you just hold still
for two seconds,

01:33:53.175 --> 01:33:55.312
I'll give you a little love
nudge, and it's all over.

01:33:56.478 --> 01:33:58.816
You're making this way harder
than it needs to be, Stillman.

01:34:01.183 --> 01:34:02.218
Stillman.

01:34:11.228 --> 01:34:14.229
No, Evan.
Evan, Evan, you know what?

01:34:14.231 --> 01:34:15.495
- Yeah, do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

01:34:15.497 --> 01:34:17.198
- Do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.367
- Yeah, I'm telling you to do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

01:34:19.369 --> 01:34:20.271
Come on.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.939
What is that, Evan?

01:34:24.941 --> 01:34:26.440
- I'm trying to get you.
- Come on, hit me, man!

01:34:26.442 --> 01:34:28.508
- You want this time machine.
- Will you shut up?

01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:30.278
- I'm trying to concentrate on hitting you...
- Right now, Evan!

01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.046
Go and hit me!

01:34:32.048 --> 01:34:33.117
You gotta...

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:40.157
God, dude. Dude, dude, dude.

01:34:48.197 --> 01:34:51.367
So I'm sorry I almost
killed you back there, man.

01:34:53.068 --> 01:34:54.170
Don't sweat it.

01:34:55.171 --> 01:34:57.174
I know what it's like
to go crazy like that.

01:34:59.142 --> 01:35:00.211
At least it's over.

01:35:01.143 --> 01:35:02.111
So it's gone?

01:35:05.314 --> 01:35:06.549
There's no memory of it.

01:35:07.851 --> 01:35:09.417
You can still get us back through
the phone, though, right?

01:35:09.419 --> 01:35:10.685
Like you did before?

01:35:10.687 --> 01:35:12.921
I mean if I...
if I'd hooked it up.

01:35:12.923 --> 01:35:15.189
- Wait, you didn't hook up the phone?
- I didn't think you were coming.

01:35:15.191 --> 01:35:16.591
So we're stuck here?

01:35:16.593 --> 01:35:19.660
No, I mean,
we're going back eventually.

01:35:19.662 --> 01:35:21.165
Just at the regular rate.

01:35:22.464 --> 01:35:23.433
Exactly.

01:35:28.037 --> 01:35:29.372
I think this time around...

01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.277
I'm gonna grow my own pot.

01:35:35.077 --> 01:35:36.880
I wasted so much money
on that last year.

01:35:45.722 --> 01:35:47.224
It's time to say goodbye.

01:35:48.058 --> 01:35:48.993
Good luck.

01:35:50.093 --> 01:35:51.028
Thanks, man.

01:36:00.135 --> 01:36:01.237
Your notebook.

01:36:06.108 --> 01:36:07.244
Goodbye.

01:36:13.282 --> 01:36:14.183
What?

01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:18.022
Oh!

01:36:19.522 --> 01:36:20.925
Oh, my God!

01:36:21.457 --> 01:36:24.161
Are you kidding me?
Get back here!

01:36:27.464 --> 01:36:28.365
Debbie?

01:36:30.433 --> 01:36:32.065
- Is that...
- Your wife?

01:36:32.067 --> 01:36:34.237
Yeah, it's me, and we're
gonna have this fight.

01:36:34.771 --> 01:36:36.671
- But how did you get...
- No, shut up!

01:36:36.673 --> 01:36:38.638
You don't get to control
my life for that long

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.541
and then go back in time
to control it again

01:36:40.543 --> 01:36:42.979
just 'cause you feel like
being, what, heroic?

01:36:43.312 --> 01:36:45.413
I didn't know what to do.

01:36:45.415 --> 01:36:48.749
- Well, stop making my decisions for me.
- Okay. I won't anymore.

01:36:48.751 --> 01:36:52.619
- Anymore? Oh, my God!
- Well, I didn't get hit,

01:36:52.621 --> 01:36:54.622
so there is no machine.

01:36:54.624 --> 01:36:56.423
- And technically, that's a decision...
- Oh, my God, stop.

01:36:56.425 --> 01:36:58.025
I don't even know
what you're talking about,

01:36:58.027 --> 01:36:59.662
but the sound of it
pisses me off.

01:37:00.662 --> 01:37:01.630
I'm sorry.

01:37:02.432 --> 01:37:04.601
For a brilliant man,
you can be such an idiot.

01:37:06.102 --> 01:37:08.168
- Yeah.
- All right, my life is mine.

01:37:08.170 --> 01:37:09.770
- It doesn't belong to you.
- I know.

01:37:09.772 --> 01:37:12.175
- And I can mess it up however I want.
- Okay.

01:37:13.242 --> 01:37:14.809
You're terrible at fighting.

01:37:14.811 --> 01:37:17.113
Well, what do you
want me to say?

01:37:18.348 --> 01:37:21.652
I screwed up, all right?
Cosmically.

01:37:22.352 --> 01:37:26.154
And now I'm trying to fix it
by intentionally destroying

01:37:26.156 --> 01:37:28.189
the most powerful invention
ever created, by the way.

01:37:28.191 --> 01:37:29.457
You don't get points for that.

01:37:29.459 --> 01:37:31.592
Oh, my God, this hurts so bad!

01:37:31.594 --> 01:37:34.298
- How do you keep doing this?
- 'Cause I wanted to make you happy!

01:37:35.464 --> 01:37:38.267
And I never made it stick!

01:37:38.668 --> 01:37:42.203
And now I'm realizing
that, scientifically speaking,

01:37:42.205 --> 01:37:47.611
that whole fixing past
mistakes thing really sucks!

01:37:49.512 --> 01:37:55.619
And all my ideas and theories
are bullshit.

01:37:56.585 --> 01:38:02.291
Because the only constant in the universe
is that we have no control over anything.

01:38:05.361 --> 01:38:08.532
So from the bottom
of my heart...

01:38:10.265 --> 01:38:11.535
I am sorry.

01:38:14.504 --> 01:38:15.738
You trapped me.

01:38:16.872 --> 01:38:18.142
I know.

01:38:19.241 --> 01:38:21.177
Do you know how bad that is?

01:38:21.710 --> 01:38:23.379
That's why I have to do this.

01:38:26.582 --> 01:38:28.152
Yeah, maybe that's best.

01:38:56.345 --> 01:38:57.677
I'm confused.

01:38:57.679 --> 01:38:59.182
- Are we together or...
- Right now...

01:39:02.585 --> 01:39:03.654
we're together.

01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:09.525
Now, that was a fight.

01:39:14.263 --> 01:39:15.498
You wanna do it again?

01:39:22.128 --> 01:39:27.128
