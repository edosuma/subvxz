Me?

08:04.125 --> 08:06.208
I've been sitting here.

08:06.250 --> 08:08.917
No, you borrowed it last week

08:06.250 --> 08:08.917
and gave it back with a stain.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.000
- Did not.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.000
- Did too.

08:11.041 --> 08:12.333
You owe me a new shirt.

08:12.375 --> 08:14.291
- Do not!

08:12.375 --> 08:14.291
- Do too!

08:14.333 --> 08:17.291
Too bad you guys can't

08:14.333 --> 08:17.291
settle this in Quad Court.

08:17.333 --> 08:18.291
Quad Court?

08:18.333 --> 08:19.500
Yeah, it's like<i> Judge Junior.</i>

08:19.542 --> 08:20.750
But with us.

08:20.792 --> 08:21.959
That's a great idea.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.208
We should bring our case

08:22.000 --> 08:23.208
to you.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.542
Totally.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.750
I don't really know.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.750
It's more of a...

08:27.792 --> 08:30.041
family thing.

08:33.458 --> 08:35.000
Would you guys settle our case

08:33.458 --> 08:35.000
in Quad Court

08:35.041 --> 08:36.542
if we brought snacks?

08:36.583 --> 08:39.875
You know,

08:36.583 --> 08:39.875
the kind my daddy makes?

08:44.125 --> 08:46.208
[both]

08:44.125 --> 08:46.208
We'll see you in court.

The Honorable Nicky...

08:55.125 --> 08:56.834
- Ricky...

08:55.125 --> 08:56.834
- Dicky...

08:56.875 --> 08:59.083
And Dawn Harper

08:56.875 --> 08:59.083
presiding.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.458
Today, we will hear

09:00.500 --> 09:05.250
"The Case of Who's to Blame for

09:00.500 --> 09:05.250
the Mystery Stain."

09:05.291 --> 09:07.458
Before we proceed,

09:05.291 --> 09:07.458
will the two parties

09:07.500 --> 09:10.667
please approach the bench

09:07.500 --> 09:10.667
with their court fees?

09:10.709 --> 09:12.875
[all]

09:10.709 --> 09:12.875
Ooh.

09:15.125 --> 09:17.542
Judges, does this

09:15.125 --> 09:17.542
please the court?

09:17.583 --> 09:18.834
Mm-hmm.

09:18.875 --> 09:20.417
Very pleased.

09:20.458 --> 09:23.959
It's good to be the judge.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.917
Okay, I gotta ask.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.041
Is this court thing happening?

09:28.083 --> 09:32.291
Is it not happening?

09:32.333 --> 09:34.750
Right, sorry.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.959
Let's begin.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.959
[sighs]

09:37.000 --> 09:40.333
Molly, please tell the court

09:37.000 --> 09:40.333
in your own words what happened.

09:40.375 --> 09:42.959
Well, I loaned Mae this shirt

09:43.000 --> 09:45.792
and it came back

09:43.000 --> 09:45.792
with this stain.

09:45.834 --> 09:48.041
I've heard enough.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.625
Molly, I sentence you

09:48.083 --> 09:50.625
to go out with me.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.583
Mae, what's your side

09:53.667 --> 09:55.583
of the story?

09:55.625 --> 09:59.250
Well, Molly loaned me the shirt,

09:55.625 --> 09:59.250
I wore it on Wednesday,

09:59.291 --> 10:01.959
and when I gave it back,

09:59.291 --> 10:01.959
it didn't have a stain on it.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.709
I've heard enough.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.834
Mae, I sentence you

10:03.750 --> 10:06.834
to go out with me.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.542
Wait, Wednesday?

10:11.583 --> 10:14.125
Wasn't that the day

10:11.583 --> 10:14.125
that we did each other's nails?

10:14.166 --> 10:16.333
Yeah, but we didn't get any

10:14.166 --> 10:16.333
on the shirt.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.250
We'll be the judges

10:16.375 --> 10:18.250
of that.

10:18.291 --> 10:19.959
Let's see

10:18.291 --> 10:19.959
your nails.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.917
And the shirt.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.333
[gasping]

10:29.375 --> 10:32.000
Whoops.

10:29.375 --> 10:32.000
Guess I'm guilty.

10:32.041 --> 10:35.500
The judges will now deliberate.

10:35.542 --> 10:37.583
Have you guys tried

10:35.542 --> 10:37.583
the mini hot dogs?

10:37.625 --> 10:39.333
The fritter is so--

[all whispering excitedly]

10:40.667 --> 10:42.166
Are we getting a verdict?

Are we not getting a verdict?

10:46.542 --> 10:48.500
[all]

10:46.542 --> 10:48.500
Guilty!

10:48.542 --> 10:50.709
Mae B. Valentine,

10:48.542 --> 10:50.709
the court sentences you

10:50.750 --> 10:53.166
to apologize to Molly.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.542
And replace her shirt.

10:55.583 --> 10:57.792
And go out with me.

10:57.834 --> 10:59.959
Or get Molly to go out with me.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.875
Judge Dicky ain't picky.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.709
Case closed.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.709
Argument settled.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.542
Let's eat.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.166
- Mmm.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.166
- Oh.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.542
- Oh, yeah.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.542
- Mmm.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.583
Too bad we don't have

11:10.583 --> 11:12.583
any more cases.

11:12.625 --> 11:16.375
I could really use a milkshake

11:12.625 --> 11:16.375
to wash down this fritter.

11:17.917 --> 11:19.542
- More cases.

11:19.583 --> 11:22.000
I wonder...

11:22.041 --> 11:26.583
Anyone else have a case

11:22.041 --> 11:26.583
they'd like for us to settle?

11:26.625 --> 11:29.208
Looks like justice

11:26.625 --> 11:29.208
is about to be served.

11:29.250 --> 11:31.458
In my mouth.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.041

or "The Case

11:42.083 --> 11:43.750
of the Lunch Line Cutter."

Two great cases

11:43.792 --> 11:48.333

Forget the pranks.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.166
Oh, maybe Mom was right.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.834
Maybe we should

12:24.208 --> 12:25.834
give up the Quad Court

12:25.875 --> 12:27.792
and start eating healthy.

12:27.834 --> 12:31.750
Just do what I do:

12:27.834 --> 12:31.750
eat through the pain.

12:31.792 --> 12:35.458

12:48.000 --> 12:52.208
of our junk food.

Why, no they're not.

15:00.750 --> 15:04.917

You know, just because

15:04.959 --> 15:07.458
everyone's getting along now

15:07.500 --> 15:09.250
doesn't mean they'll

15:07.500 --> 15:09.250
always get along.

15:09.291 --> 15:12.750
What if someone

15:09.291 --> 15:12.750
stirred up a little trouble?

15:12.792 --> 15:15.166
So you're suggesting

15:12.792 --> 15:15.166
we start fights

15:15.208 --> 15:17.375
just to get more court cases?

15:17.417 --> 15:19.041
- That is unethical.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.041
- Immoral.

And just plain wrong.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.583
in the bathroom after lunch,

16:20.625 --> 16:22.166
so I called my mother,

16:22.208 --> 16:24.166
but then I dropped my phone

in the toilet, and--

trying to stick up for your

But all of the evidence

17:30.917 --> 17:33.125
