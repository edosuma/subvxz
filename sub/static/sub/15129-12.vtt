00:00.230 --> 00:01.930
Previously on "Saving Hope"...

00:01.998 --> 00:03.824
Transcranial magnetic stimulation.

00:03.924 --> 00:05.019
Basically, it excites the brain.

00:05.119 --> 00:08.068
Usually, dead people talk to me.
Why aren't you talking to me?

00:08.137 --> 00:09.370
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna
be able to get away.

00:09.438 --> 00:10.838
You've been cheating on her.

00:10.905 --> 00:12.940
- Why would you assume that?
- Because I know you, Joel.

00:13.008 --> 00:15.443
You remember that time that I
kissed you? I take it back.

00:15.511 --> 00:17.111
Hey! Uhh!

00:17.179 --> 00:19.880
I'm sorry, Maggie. I'm sorry, too.

00:19.948 --> 00:21.548
I was in the car...

00:21.616 --> 00:23.517
- Daddy, please! Slow down!
- You're not gonna make it!

00:23.584 --> 00:25.952
And I saw my parents die.

00:26.020 --> 00:28.288
You moved. You moved.

00:30.858 --> 00:31.691
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:31.759 --> 00:33.293
Dr. Goran.

00:33.361 --> 00:35.061
Dr. Kinney.

00:35.129 --> 00:37.429
You look good today.

00:37.497 --> 00:39.798
I don't feel good.
I haven't slept in three nights,

00:39.866 --> 00:42.234
I have a 10 year old who wants
to get her navel pierced,

00:42.302 --> 00:44.637
and I just got off
the phone with our lawyer.

00:44.704 --> 00:46.772
Shawn Price... your very
first surgical case

00:46.839 --> 00:48.974
here at the hospital...
they just settled his lawsuit.

00:49.042 --> 00:50.509
- How much?
- $50,000.

00:50.577 --> 00:52.144
Well, that's basically like a win.

00:52.211 --> 00:53.778
It cost us double that in legal fees.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.481
Okay, listen to me. I made a decision.

00:56.549 --> 00:58.683
You made a bad decision, right,
because you're not thinking.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.585
- You gotta think.
- No, actually, I was thinking.

01:00.653 --> 01:01.986
You were thinking about yourself.

01:02.054 --> 01:03.888
- No, I was thinking about my patient, Dana.
- Uh-huh.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.190
- Thank you very much.
- About...

01:05.257 --> 01:06.524
About saving his arm.

01:06.592 --> 01:09.359
Against his wishes,
which the court recognized.

01:09.427 --> 01:12.629
So moving forward,
if you're ever in doubt again,

01:12.697 --> 01:15.098
I want you to replace
that voice in your head

01:15.166 --> 01:17.634
with mine.

01:21.806 --> 01:24.740
Charlie, can you open your eyes for me?

01:24.808 --> 01:26.475
You know I can't, doc.

01:26.543 --> 01:28.678
Frankly, I wish you'd quit asking me to.

01:28.745 --> 01:31.614
It's getting a little hard on the old ego.

01:33.617 --> 01:36.085
So any change?

01:36.152 --> 01:37.986
The diagnosis is he's screwed.

01:38.054 --> 01:40.422
He's still a 6. I'm sorry,
there's no improvement.

01:40.489 --> 01:42.957
The T.M.S worked, Shahir.

01:43.025 --> 01:44.226
We don't know that.

01:44.293 --> 01:47.329
Uh, there was radical movement.

01:47.396 --> 01:48.830
Which could've been a seizure.

01:48.897 --> 01:51.099
It wasn't a seizure. He moved.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.428
- You have done deep brain stimulation...
- Alex...

01:53.528 --> 01:56.437
On patients with Parkinson's
and had success.

01:56.504 --> 02:00.374
Okay, deep brain stimulation
is a highly experimental thing.

02:00.442 --> 02:03.244
By stimulating parts of
the thalamus, you have found

02:03.311 --> 02:04.511
that certain patients have been aroused

02:04.579 --> 02:06.680
to the point of being unable to sleep.

02:06.748 --> 02:08.048
Now with a coma patient,

02:08.116 --> 02:10.451
that same procedure could
induce waking, right?

02:10.518 --> 02:11.719
Keep pushing him, Alex.

02:11.786 --> 02:12.918
You've been doing your research.

02:12.986 --> 02:14.454
Am I right or not? Is it possible?

02:14.521 --> 02:17.323
- It's a completely different...
- Shahir, is it possible?

02:17.391 --> 02:20.593
Yes, theoretically, it is possible.

02:20.661 --> 02:22.595
But it could cause brain damage, Alex.

02:22.663 --> 02:23.963
We could hit the middle cerebral artery.

02:24.030 --> 02:26.599
He could bleed out fast and he could die.

02:26.667 --> 02:28.467
You won't let that happen.

02:28.534 --> 02:31.236
He responded to the T.M.S.
This is our next move.

02:31.304 --> 02:33.438
I want you to book an O.R.

02:38.944 --> 02:40.945
That's my girl.

02:44.816 --> 02:46.049
- It's okay.
- Good?

02:46.117 --> 02:47.084
- Yeah.
- Better?

02:47.152 --> 02:48.319
- Reycraft.
- Sometimes.

02:48.387 --> 02:49.387
What's happening?

02:49.454 --> 02:51.088
Uh, Stacey Harrison...

02:51.156 --> 02:53.457
36-year-old jockey injured
in a fall at the racetrack.

02:53.525 --> 02:56.093
Friggin' bug boy
put me in too tight.

02:56.161 --> 02:57.227
What is a bug boy?

02:57.296 --> 02:58.763
An apprentice jockey.

02:58.830 --> 03:00.430
They're like junior residents,
except, you know...

03:00.498 --> 03:01.864
I'm impressed.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.668
My uncle was a hot walker.
I grew up at the track.

03:04.735 --> 03:07.570
Anyway, Stacey, this is, uh, Dr. Goran.

03:07.638 --> 03:09.673
He's the man I came to see.

03:09.740 --> 03:10.740
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:10.808 --> 03:12.275
What are we looking at?

03:12.343 --> 03:13.510
Pelvic ring injury.

03:13.577 --> 03:15.512
Yeah, it's definitely busted.

03:15.579 --> 03:18.180
I've broken every bone in my body.
I know the feeling.

03:18.247 --> 03:20.449
Right. Well, we'll need to stabilize it.

03:20.517 --> 03:22.685
Somebody get me a binder, please.

03:22.752 --> 03:24.353
I miss the Oaks Stakes because of this,

03:24.421 --> 03:27.155
I swear, Angel Martinez is a dead man.

03:27.223 --> 03:28.924
Okay, Stacey, you need to calm down.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.293
Uh, you should give me more drugs.

03:31.361 --> 03:33.227
Okay, let's give her 5 more
milligrams of morphine.

03:33.295 --> 03:36.831
And maybe a sponge bath from him.

03:36.898 --> 03:38.866
Well, that will be between
the two of you, Stacey.

03:38.934 --> 03:40.335
♪ rub a dub-dub ♪

03:40.402 --> 03:41.536
Ah.

03:41.603 --> 03:43.270
- Oh, here.
- Thank you.

03:44.177 --> 03:45.275
Okay, this is gonna hurt
a little. All right?

03:45.375 --> 03:45.872
Okay. Yeah.

03:45.941 --> 03:46.941
Okay.

03:48.909 --> 03:52.312
Center the velcro complex
over the greater trochanters.

03:52.380 --> 03:53.980
That's it.

03:54.048 --> 03:54.981
Okay.

03:55.049 --> 03:56.015
Okay.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.217
Sorry about this.

03:57.284 --> 03:58.352
Don't be.

03:59.420 --> 04:00.354
Aah!

04:02.757 --> 04:04.690
Okay.

04:04.758 --> 04:05.924
Okay.

04:05.992 --> 04:08.126
She's good to go. Let's move her upstairs.

04:08.194 --> 04:09.462
Thanks, doc.

04:10.764 --> 04:11.997
See you in the tub.

04:12.065 --> 04:15.534
You have a gift.

04:17.000 --> 04:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:31.417 --> 04:35.052
You should've waited
for the next elevator.

04:35.120 --> 04:37.721
Yeah, you're right.
There's too much baggage in here.

04:39.791 --> 04:41.625
All right, Alex, you know what?

04:41.693 --> 04:44.828
Whatever this thing is
that's happening between us right now,

04:44.896 --> 04:46.530
it's real.

04:46.598 --> 04:48.231
What do you want from me, Joel?

04:48.299 --> 04:50.066
I know I haven't handled
myself too well lately.

04:50.134 --> 04:51.769
- I know that.
- No. No. I just don't...

04:51.836 --> 04:53.168
I don't understand. What do you want?

04:53.236 --> 04:54.637
Do I leave my comatose fiance,

04:54.705 --> 04:55.938
then we get back together again?
And then what?

04:56.006 --> 04:57.507
That's not what I'm saying at all.

04:57.574 --> 04:59.542
- What I'm trying to talk...
- No. No. I just... I need you...

05:00.878 --> 05:02.077
To stop.

05:11.388 --> 05:13.022
So this is it, huh?

05:13.089 --> 05:16.091
Midfield, 4th and long.

05:16.159 --> 05:18.961
Time is running down.

05:19.029 --> 05:21.663
Wish I would've known
he was having surgery.

05:21.731 --> 05:23.232
It was a last minute decision.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.566
Hail Mary time.

05:24.634 --> 05:26.367
Would've cleaned him up,
given him a shave.

05:26.435 --> 05:29.237
Dr. Hamza's waiting in the O.R.

05:29.305 --> 05:30.871
Can I bring him down with you?

05:30.940 --> 05:32.307
Of course you can.

05:37.846 --> 05:40.214
Deep brain stimulation.

05:40.282 --> 05:43.750
After this...

05:43.818 --> 05:46.286
there's nothing.

05:46.354 --> 05:48.355
How many children do you have, Roy?

05:48.423 --> 05:51.425
Easy. Same as her.

05:51.492 --> 05:54.161
We have one son,

05:54.228 --> 05:56.696
and he knows that. You know that, Roy.

05:56.764 --> 05:58.597
How about the year, Mr. Goldbach?

05:58.665 --> 06:00.732
I don't know.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.634
How about the date?

06:02.702 --> 06:04.437
Day? Month?

06:04.504 --> 06:06.772
Haven't the faintest idea.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.640
Well, that's an easy one, Roy.

06:08.708 --> 06:09.808
Maybe for you.

06:09.876 --> 06:11.110
You should really try to answer.

06:11.178 --> 06:12.445
Dr. Murphy.

06:12.512 --> 06:14.112
Just try and remember.

06:14.180 --> 06:15.447
I-I don't...

06:15.514 --> 06:17.815
Yesterday was Monday.

06:17.883 --> 06:20.118
Then Tuesday...

06:20.186 --> 06:22.653
That's right. Tuesday. He got it.

06:22.721 --> 06:25.156
Mr. Goldbach, you scored 18 out of 30

06:25.224 --> 06:27.225
on your mental status exam.

06:27.293 --> 06:29.826
I'm obliged by law to take
away your driver's license.

06:29.894 --> 06:32.262
Now how am I gonna get to bridge?

06:32.330 --> 06:34.198
And how am I going to get to work?

06:34.265 --> 06:35.366
You don't work anymore, Roy.

06:35.433 --> 06:37.301
Of course I work. I work every day.

06:37.369 --> 06:38.802
I have a shop downtown.

06:38.870 --> 06:40.770
This is your memory issue
that we've discussed.

06:40.838 --> 06:42.806
Sorry.

06:42.874 --> 06:44.508
Right.

06:44.575 --> 06:47.343
Well, our time's up.

06:47.411 --> 06:48.677
But wait.

06:48.745 --> 06:50.046
Dr. Druckerman.

06:50.114 --> 06:51.847
Um, we didn't get

06:51.915 --> 06:53.649
any individual therapy time with Esther.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.284
- We have another patient coming.
- If I'm late for work...

06:55.352 --> 06:58.187
I think she could really
use some new tools.

06:58.255 --> 06:59.788
There's a clinic that I was
reading about in Oregon.

06:59.856 --> 07:01.956
- The Hewitson Center.
- Yeah, they have...

07:02.025 --> 07:03.925
They take their lead from
the Alzheimer's patients.

07:03.993 --> 07:05.427
That's because they have

07:05.495 --> 07:07.496
a 1-to-3 physician to
patient ratio. We don't.

07:07.563 --> 07:08.997
You really want to do something to help?

07:09.065 --> 07:11.133
Get the Goldbachs a taxi.

07:14.703 --> 07:16.338
Esther, I'm so sorry we ran out of time.

07:16.406 --> 07:19.440
No, thank you. You've been very kind.

07:19.508 --> 07:24.578
Well, now why isn't she my doctor?

07:24.646 --> 07:26.180
Hello there.

07:26.248 --> 07:28.382
Roy, Esther, this is Maggie.

07:28.450 --> 07:30.418
You have to excuse my husband.

07:30.485 --> 07:33.553
Nothing brings him to life
like a pretty young girl.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.921
Pleasure to meet you.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.089
You, too.

07:36.157 --> 07:38.525
Hey. I forgot.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.094
Here. My card.

07:41.162 --> 07:45.097
I'm gonna put my personal
cell number on the back.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.498
I'm never in my office.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.568
You don't have an office.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.702
Guess that's why.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.403
Uh, call me anytime.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.405
I'd rather have her number.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.874
We're all right from here.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.142
Come on, Romeo.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.713
Isn't it against the rules

08:01.781 --> 08:04.015
to give your personal cell
phone number out to patients?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.484
Well, last time I checked,

08:05.552 --> 08:07.386
it wasn't against the rules to care.

08:07.454 --> 08:08.753
Mm. Badass.

08:08.821 --> 08:10.556
Shut up.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.807
Good luck.

08:47.999 --> 08:50.260
You can do it. You can.

08:50.816 --> 08:53.113
Because I know you can.

08:53.181 --> 08:54.524
Because I know.

08:55.854 --> 08:56.854
Okay.

08:57.138 --> 08:58.552
Okay. Okay.

08:58.734 --> 09:00.913
Call me back. All right.

09:02.757 --> 09:04.391
Your new girlfriend?

09:04.994 --> 09:06.566
She's not my girlfriend.

09:06.749 --> 09:07.749
Does she know that?

09:07.849 --> 09:09.826
'Cause a girl kinda likes
to know these things.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.896
Still hurting from your
breakup with Goran?

09:12.966 --> 09:14.275
So your new girlfriend...

09:14.375 --> 09:16.180
she jumping out of a plane or what?

09:16.280 --> 09:17.985
No. Haircut.

09:18.724 --> 09:19.724
What?

09:20.304 --> 09:22.277
Not everybody looks good in short hair.

09:22.542 --> 09:24.522
I mean, not you.

09:26.459 --> 09:27.498
Oh, my god. I'll grab

09:27.598 --> 09:29.727
a pair of mayos from
the O.R. and do it myself.

09:30.537 --> 09:31.649
Hello.

09:31.969 --> 09:34.118
Uh, this is Esther Goldbach.

09:34.186 --> 09:35.520
Mrs. Goldbach.

09:35.587 --> 09:37.517
We got back from the appointment, and, um,

09:37.626 --> 09:39.557
Roy said he was going to work,

09:39.625 --> 09:41.225
so I hid the car keys,

09:41.293 --> 09:43.160
and now he's going crazy.

09:43.228 --> 09:44.672
What should I do?

09:44.979 --> 09:46.331
Can you bring him back in?

09:46.398 --> 09:48.499
Well, I don't drive.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.934
Uh, should I give him the keys?

09:51.001 --> 09:52.625
No, don't do that. Uh...

09:52.757 --> 09:54.072
What about a taxi?

09:54.193 --> 09:56.620
Oh, I'll never get him into a taxi.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.792
Where's the keys?

09:57.892 --> 10:02.546
He's just too upset.
Uh, okay. Uh, I'll try.

10:02.613 --> 10:04.080
Esther?

10:06.106 --> 10:07.850
It's the Alzheimer's couple.

10:07.917 --> 10:10.252
She's freaking out.
She wants me to come over, I think.

10:10.320 --> 10:11.787
You're still on shift.

10:11.855 --> 10:13.723
Yeah, I can't just cut out.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.392
She's not answering.

10:17.994 --> 10:19.462
What am I supposed to do?

10:19.529 --> 10:21.129
I say go.

10:21.197 --> 10:22.864
But what about Druckerman?

10:22.931 --> 10:24.265
Worry about him later.

10:24.333 --> 10:27.168
You're right. You're right. Thank you.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.275
What are you doing?

10:34.343 --> 10:36.077
I'm coming with you.
I'm on break, and like she said,

10:36.144 --> 10:39.480
nothing brings him back to
life like a pretty girl.

10:39.547 --> 10:40.748
Wh...

10:45.286 --> 10:47.888
Stacey.

10:47.955 --> 10:49.757
You have a pelvic fracture.

10:49.824 --> 10:51.592
- I called it.
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.659 --> 10:52.993
Open book?

10:53.060 --> 10:54.460
Sacroiliac joint on
the right is disrupted,

10:54.528 --> 10:56.262
in keeping with an open book injury.

10:56.329 --> 10:57.830
Widened pubis symphysis.

10:57.898 --> 10:58.998
Wow.

10:59.065 --> 11:00.400
Bones are my business, too.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.468
Well, you could give some
of my young residents

11:02.536 --> 11:03.669
a run for their money.

11:03.737 --> 11:05.137
Speaking of running for money,

11:05.205 --> 11:06.806
the Oaks Stakes is in two months.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.641
I got a mount with a real shot.

11:08.709 --> 11:09.974
I need to be back for it.

11:10.042 --> 11:11.610
Well, two months...

11:11.677 --> 11:13.111
that's a tall order.

11:13.178 --> 11:15.013
Why do you think I came here?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.615
Okay, Stacey, well,

11:16.682 --> 11:19.984
we could go the conservative
route with this one,

11:20.052 --> 11:22.120
you know, partial weight-bearing crutches,

11:22.187 --> 11:23.522
physiotherapy.

11:23.589 --> 11:25.523
I'm on the shelf how long?

11:25.590 --> 11:27.825
Six months.

11:27.893 --> 11:29.359
No way.

11:29.428 --> 11:31.762
Or we could do surgery.

11:31.830 --> 11:33.597
I'm talking about
a percutaneous screw fixation.

11:33.665 --> 11:35.132
Will get me back out on the track.

11:35.199 --> 11:38.368
Only if surgery is successful.

11:38.437 --> 11:39.970
You see, you're running
the risk of infection here.

11:40.038 --> 11:42.204
You could damage blood
vessels and nerves. It's...

11:42.272 --> 11:44.307
I'm willing to take that risk.

11:45.743 --> 11:47.243
Okay.

11:49.814 --> 11:53.683
What happened? They turn
you into a gelding here?

11:53.751 --> 11:55.084
A stallion with no balls.

11:55.152 --> 11:56.619
I know... uh, thank you...

11:56.687 --> 11:58.987
what a gelding is.

12:00.623 --> 12:05.126
Stacey, without surgery,
you'll be out only six months.

12:05.194 --> 12:09.297
I'm a 36-year-old journeyman rider.

12:09.365 --> 12:11.867
Six months off, I lose all my connections.

12:11.935 --> 12:14.301
My career is over.

12:14.369 --> 12:16.504
Okay, I don't think that
career is necessarily...

12:16.572 --> 12:19.039
It's all I ever wanted to do...

12:19.107 --> 12:20.608
ride.

12:20.676 --> 12:22.743
Nothing like it.

12:22.811 --> 12:27.081
That feeling of being
in a race, that rush.

12:27.148 --> 12:28.683
You ever get that feeling?

12:28.750 --> 12:30.416
Every day.

12:30.485 --> 12:32.051
At the O.R.

12:32.119 --> 12:33.152
And if someone threatened
to take it from you,

12:33.220 --> 12:34.220
what would you do?

12:34.288 --> 12:35.722
I don't know.

12:35.790 --> 12:38.725
I mean, what would you risk
to get to keep doing it?

12:38.793 --> 12:41.394
Trust your gut on this.

12:41.462 --> 12:45.198
If your gut says operate,
I wanna take that risk.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.868
Yeah, I'll call down.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.105
I'll tell them to book the O.R.

13:05.183 --> 13:06.684
I'm so glad you've come.

13:06.752 --> 13:08.753
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

13:08.821 --> 13:11.255
No, but he's still looking for his keys,

13:11.323 --> 13:12.924
because he wants to leave.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.158
Can you calm him down?

13:14.226 --> 13:15.927
I think I can help you do that.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.662
When you criticize him for
not remembering things,

13:18.730 --> 13:19.997
he can get aggressive,

13:20.064 --> 13:21.732
so we're gonna try
something completely new

13:21.799 --> 13:23.466
and try going along for the ride with him.

13:23.535 --> 13:27.137
You mean like pretending that...
that what he's saying is true?

13:27.204 --> 13:29.172
Exactly. Because it is true,

13:29.240 --> 13:30.707
for him.

13:30.775 --> 13:32.576
Okay.

13:32.644 --> 13:33.676
I'll take your lead.

13:36.613 --> 13:38.915
Roy?

13:38.982 --> 13:42.217
Where are my keys?

13:42.285 --> 13:43.370
Who are you?

13:43.470 --> 13:44.790
My name is Gavin.

13:44.988 --> 13:46.722
It's your doctor, Roy.

13:46.790 --> 13:48.791
I've never seen these
people before in my life.

13:48.859 --> 13:51.593
Oh, come on, Roy. You remember Dr. Murphy.

13:51.661 --> 13:52.928
Esther.

13:52.995 --> 13:55.463
Tell him to get the hell out of my house.

13:55.531 --> 13:57.298
I've got to get to work.

13:57.366 --> 13:59.100
I've got to go.

14:00.937 --> 14:03.872
Now I'm aiming for the central thalamus,

14:03.940 --> 14:06.840
or more specifically,
the intralaminar nuclei.

14:06.908 --> 14:08.442
The brain is like Europe.

14:08.509 --> 14:11.679
Each region has its own language.

14:11.746 --> 14:13.647
And once we find the right wave pattern,

14:13.715 --> 14:17.250
I'll know where to leave the electrode.

14:17.318 --> 14:19.587
And then you start stimulating?

14:19.654 --> 14:21.688
Mm-hmm. We pass the rod into the brain...

14:26.827 --> 14:30.930
And then feed this electrode
through the rod...

14:30.998 --> 14:32.531
And then you're in.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.634
And then we're in.

14:34.702 --> 14:36.362
You hear that?

14:36.462 --> 14:37.101
Yeah.

14:37.201 --> 14:40.672
That is the distinct auditory
signature of the thalamus.

14:40.786 --> 14:42.608
Can you start it at 1 volt, please?

14:42.675 --> 14:44.810
1 volt.

14:44.877 --> 14:46.444
Thank you.

14:48.547 --> 14:49.547
Okay, how quickly...

14:49.616 --> 14:51.883
Alex, this isn't an appendectomy

14:51.951 --> 14:53.318
or anything like that. Please.

14:53.385 --> 14:55.385
Right.

14:55.453 --> 14:57.021
Why don't you let us brain
nerds do our thing for a while?

14:57.089 --> 14:58.689
I'll page you the minute anything changes.

14:58.757 --> 14:59.690
Promise?

14:59.758 --> 15:01.858
Mm-hmm. I promise.

15:20.043 --> 15:23.346
Charlie, can you look up for me?

15:23.413 --> 15:25.981
Now to your left.

15:26.049 --> 15:27.716
The other left.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.787
Thank you, Charlie.

15:31.855 --> 15:33.622
There's nothing wrong with him.

15:33.689 --> 15:36.258
I'd say there is, doc. He doesn't talk.

15:36.325 --> 15:37.592
Since the accident?

15:37.660 --> 15:39.127
Hasn't said a word.

15:39.195 --> 15:42.096
Well, apart from a small
contusion on his forehead,

15:42.165 --> 15:43.765
there's nothing physically wrong with him.

15:43.832 --> 15:45.433
So what, he's just a mute?

15:45.501 --> 15:47.202
Mike.

15:47.270 --> 15:50.371
If we could, um, uh...

15:55.443 --> 15:58.045
Um, what Charlie witnessed...

15:58.112 --> 15:59.813
sometimes after a traumatic event,

15:59.881 --> 16:03.217
a child stops talking altogether.

16:03.285 --> 16:05.152
So what do we do?

16:05.219 --> 16:07.787
There's not much we can do.
Just be patient,

16:07.854 --> 16:11.424
do your best to keep him safe,
and hope he gets better.

16:28.790 --> 16:30.988
Increase it to 2 volts.

16:31.245 --> 16:32.945
2 volts.

16:45.992 --> 16:47.393
- Did he go in the barn?
- I don't know.

16:47.460 --> 16:49.461
Charlie!

16:52.832 --> 16:54.733
- Charlie!
- You guys seen Charlie?

16:54.801 --> 16:56.234
Uh, he's up there.

16:56.302 --> 16:57.536
Charlie!

16:57.603 --> 17:01.306
Charlie, where are you?

17:01.373 --> 17:03.574
Charlie!

17:03.642 --> 17:05.175
Charlie!

17:07.244 --> 17:09.212
Charlie, are you in here?

17:11.382 --> 17:14.050
He must be hiding somewhere else.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.819
We got a house full of people,
and he just runs off?

17:15.887 --> 17:17.154
He's 6, Mike.

17:17.221 --> 17:19.622
What the hell are we gonna do with him?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.257
Whoa. What kind of question is that?

17:21.325 --> 17:22.959
Beth, I loved your sister.

17:23.026 --> 17:24.527
You hated my sister.

17:24.595 --> 17:27.630
That's not the point.
You ready to be a parent?

17:27.698 --> 17:30.433
I'm not.

17:30.501 --> 17:31.668
He's my nephew. We can't...

17:31.735 --> 17:33.202
We just scrape by as it is.

17:33.270 --> 17:35.071
We take Charlie,
and I have to get a second job.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.706
I can barely keep the one. Besides...

17:37.774 --> 17:38.874
What?

17:38.942 --> 17:40.208
He's weird.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.677
He is not weird.

17:41.744 --> 17:45.213
He doesn't talk.
He doesn't do normal kid things.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.649
It makes you wonder if...

17:47.717 --> 17:49.417
Wonder what?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.822
This is empty. I'm gonna grab another one.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.934
My customers are

18:07.002 --> 18:08.668
gonna be standing on the sidewalk waiting.

18:08.736 --> 18:10.670
I've got to find those keys.

18:10.738 --> 18:12.672
Don't argue with him.
Try to find a way to say yes

18:12.740 --> 18:13.940
Instead of saying no.

18:14.008 --> 18:15.876
I have responsibilities.

18:15.943 --> 18:18.745
Of course you do. You have the-the shop.

18:18.813 --> 18:20.847
What-what kind of shop is it again?

18:20.915 --> 18:22.582
Well, it's a-a clothing shop.

18:22.650 --> 18:26.852
Uh, Roy worked, uh, he works in menswear.

18:26.920 --> 18:31.390
Menswear. Wow. I am desperately
in need of a new suit.

18:31.457 --> 18:32.525
Maybe something like a...

18:32.592 --> 18:33.859
Brown corduroy.

18:33.927 --> 18:35.794
Wide lapel?

18:35.862 --> 18:37.396
42 long.

18:37.463 --> 18:39.431
That's right.

18:39.499 --> 18:40.899
Huh. You can tell that
just by looking at him?

18:40.966 --> 18:43.001
When you've been at it
as long as I have...

18:44.570 --> 18:47.338
Uh, Roy, um, I-I-I just
remembered to tell you.

18:47.406 --> 18:50.008
I think that that, uh, new kid...

18:50.075 --> 18:51.175
What's his name?

18:51.243 --> 18:52.176
Nathan.

18:52.244 --> 18:53.811
Nathan. That's right.

18:53.879 --> 18:55.913
He-he's holding the fort today.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.015
So-so I don't have to go in?

18:58.082 --> 19:01.151
That's right. It's your day off. Right.

19:01.218 --> 19:03.219
So, you know, you can just relax.

19:03.287 --> 19:04.788
What are we waiting for? Why don't we...

19:04.856 --> 19:07.190
Why don't we get these
two some coffee? Hmm?

19:07.258 --> 19:09.927
So, 42 long, are you a golfer?

19:09.994 --> 19:12.161
Come here. Come here.
Something I want to show you.

19:12.228 --> 19:13.462
- Here. Do you, uh...
- Good.

19:13.530 --> 19:15.464
Do you, uh, do you know what that is?

19:15.532 --> 19:18.668
We're gonna stabilize
the sacroiliac joint,

19:18.735 --> 19:22.438
navigating away from
the great vessels anteriorly

19:22.505 --> 19:24.941
and then...

19:25.008 --> 19:27.476
the spinal canal.

19:27.544 --> 19:30.045
Dr. Goran?

19:30.112 --> 19:31.846
Uh, is the image intensifier in place?

19:31.914 --> 19:33.715
In place.

19:33.783 --> 19:34.950
Drill.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.969
The bad news is...

19:55.036 --> 19:57.237
you're teeing off next Thursday.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.741
Roy's an excellent golfer.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.843
- I bet. Hole in one.
- Mm-hmm.

20:03.911 --> 20:06.278
18 holes, you know, every Sunday,

20:06.346 --> 20:09.281
rain or shine.

20:09.349 --> 20:13.219
But not so much lately, am I right, Roy?

20:13.286 --> 20:16.722
I'm sorry. Uh, do I know you?

20:16.789 --> 20:19.825
I'm Gavin and this is Maggie.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.294
And you're friends of my wife's?

20:23.362 --> 20:26.064
Yes, we are. We're...
we're friends with Esther.

20:26.132 --> 20:27.799
Yeah. It's nice to see you again.

20:27.867 --> 20:30.435
He's just tired. Aren't you, Roy? Hmm?

20:30.503 --> 20:32.536
Where are my car keys?

20:32.604 --> 20:34.705
You've had quite the day,
haven't you, Roy?

20:34.773 --> 20:36.741
I-I-I've got to, uh...

20:36.808 --> 20:39.076
Oh.

20:39.144 --> 20:41.979
Excuse me. Who are you?
The-the-the mother?

20:42.047 --> 20:43.614
What?

20:43.682 --> 20:45.449
Our boys.

20:47.119 --> 20:49.786
Our boys must...

20:49.854 --> 20:53.489
Yes, they-they do.
They know each other, from school.

20:54.859 --> 20:57.460
I'm sorry, but I can't do this.

20:57.528 --> 20:59.095
Gav.

20:59.163 --> 21:04.900
Roy, I am your wife,
and we've been married for 55 years.

21:04.968 --> 21:06.001
Don't yell at me.

21:06.069 --> 21:07.970
- Okay.
- Look at me!

21:09.405 --> 21:12.340
I have a baby at home to support!

21:12.408 --> 21:14.143
I think I hurt my leg.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.378
I think she broke a hip.

21:16.445 --> 21:18.346
Ooh.

21:18.414 --> 21:19.648
This is Dr. Murphy.

21:19.715 --> 21:21.149
I have an elderly patient
who's had a fall.

21:21.216 --> 21:22.717
I need an ambulance.

21:26.254 --> 21:30.624
So much scar tissue.
It's like a minefield in there.

21:30.692 --> 21:32.560
Do you want to pull the wire
out and start again, doc?

21:32.627 --> 21:35.229
No, I'm past the S.I.
joint and the S1 body.

21:35.297 --> 21:37.264
Ah, damn it.

21:37.332 --> 21:41.034
Get me a partially threaded
cancellous screw, please.

21:47.374 --> 21:49.409
Okay.

22:02.988 --> 22:06.358
- No. No, no, no, no. No. No.
- Dr. Goran?

22:07.927 --> 22:09.561
The wire's advanced too deep.

22:09.629 --> 22:13.098
I think I just perforated an artery.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.899
Removing the wire right now.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.337
Dr. Goran. Get me some sponges, damn it.

22:19.404 --> 22:20.738
Pressure's dropping. Systolic at 60.

22:20.805 --> 22:22.240
I need a general surgeon.

22:22.307 --> 22:24.141
Can somebody get this
thing out of here, please?

22:24.209 --> 22:25.876
Pour fluids. Get me two units of O-neg.

22:25.944 --> 22:28.045
Massive transfusion protocol.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.881
Get me Dr. Reid in here right now.

22:34.848 --> 22:36.081
B.P. 60 over 40.

22:36.149 --> 22:37.616
She's gonna arrest.

22:37.684 --> 22:38.951
Okay, we're gonna do a midline laparotomy

22:39.018 --> 22:40.319
to find this retroperitoneal bleeder.

22:40.386 --> 22:41.854
I need vascular instruments...

22:41.922 --> 22:43.489
Cooleys, satinskys, 3-0 silk ties,

22:43.557 --> 22:44.571
and plenty of suction.

22:44.671 --> 22:45.314
Vitals are good?

22:45.414 --> 22:47.660
Yes, sats are holding.
She's managing so far.

22:47.727 --> 22:48.827
Ready?

22:48.894 --> 22:51.295
- Yep.
- Let's do this.

22:56.669 --> 22:57.735
Okay, start packing.

22:57.803 --> 22:59.704
Sponges. Keep 'em coming.

22:59.772 --> 23:01.973
I need to establish
proximal vascular control,

23:02.040 --> 23:04.575
so I have to cross-clamp the aorta.

23:04.642 --> 23:06.443
And... okay.

23:06.511 --> 23:07.644
Aorta clamp.

23:07.712 --> 23:10.213
Give me the retractors.

23:11.215 --> 23:12.516
- In?
- Yeah.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.854
Great.

23:16.921 --> 23:19.523
Okay, I have to get down
in there nice and low.

23:19.591 --> 23:21.357
And...

23:21.424 --> 23:23.526
Okay, I've got proximal control.

23:23.594 --> 23:25.027
Give me a second.

23:25.095 --> 23:27.329
Okay, we're going to identify the ureter

23:27.397 --> 23:28.698
and the iliac bifurcation,

23:28.765 --> 23:30.299
then we're gonna get
down into the internal

23:30.367 --> 23:31.534
and find the laceration.

23:31.602 --> 23:33.102
Then tie off the artery that I hit.

23:33.169 --> 23:36.838
Lactate is up to 4.8.

23:36.906 --> 23:39.173
If she suffers an infarction
to her anterior spinal cord,

23:39.241 --> 23:41.643
she c... she could be paralyzed.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.247
What the hell?

23:46.315 --> 23:47.649
She still has
some feeling in her legs...

23:47.717 --> 23:48.950
But she won't be able to use 'em.

23:49.018 --> 23:51.252
- What happened in there?
- I hit an artery.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.520
Dr. Goran isn't responsible.

23:52.587 --> 23:54.121
The wire was bound within the drill

23:54.188 --> 23:56.456
and advanced into
the retroperitoneal space.

23:56.525 --> 23:58.559
I caused the laceration to
the internal iliac artery

23:58.627 --> 24:00.694
and I couldn't control the bleeding.

24:00.762 --> 24:03.664
And I was called in.
We opened her up and got control.

24:03.732 --> 24:05.499
Why did you go ahead with this surgery?

24:05.567 --> 24:08.101
You told me you wanted me to
start listening to my patients,

24:08.169 --> 24:09.536
and this is what the patient wanted.

24:09.570 --> 24:11.370
- So this is my fault?
- That's not what I'm saying.

24:11.438 --> 24:12.539
It was a freak occurrence.

24:12.606 --> 24:14.240
Yeah, you mentioned.

24:14.307 --> 24:16.709
Okay, I discussed the various
options with my patient, Dana,

24:16.777 --> 24:19.345
and this is what we decided upon together.

24:19.413 --> 24:21.180
Well, tell you what.
For the next few months,

24:21.248 --> 24:23.449
I want those options
discussed with me, too.

24:23.517 --> 24:26.818
Every surgery you book,
you walk me through it first.

24:26.886 --> 24:29.254
Fine.

24:29.321 --> 24:30.422
Then we're done.

24:39.732 --> 24:41.098
It's not your fault, Joel.

24:41.166 --> 24:42.833
We all have recognized complications.

24:42.901 --> 24:44.268
You-you couldn't have done anything more.

24:44.335 --> 24:45.603
My head's just not in the game right now.

24:45.671 --> 24:47.104
It hasn't been for a while.

24:47.172 --> 24:49.139
It's just a rough patch.
Every surgeon goes through them.

24:49.207 --> 24:50.741
Look, I just feel like working here is

24:50.809 --> 24:52.443
destroying my instincts, you know?

24:52.510 --> 24:54.011
Okay, you know what? It wasn't your fault.

24:54.079 --> 24:55.880
My patient is paralyzed.

24:55.948 --> 24:57.948
You are a great surgeon, Joel.

24:58.015 --> 24:59.115
Well, a great surgeon wouldn't have

24:59.183 --> 25:00.884
let what happened today happen.

25:00.952 --> 25:03.453
You saved her life.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.388
Thank you.

25:12.662 --> 25:15.097
This way, Mr. Goldbach.

25:15.164 --> 25:16.531
Where are they taking him?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.566
To admitting, Esther.

25:17.634 --> 25:18.934
They can't take him to jail.

25:19.002 --> 25:20.603
Well, he's not going to jail.

25:20.670 --> 25:22.972
He'll forget to take his baby aspirin.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.641
He's just gonna spend the night
in the hospital. He'll be fine.

25:25.709 --> 25:28.710
Do you know what the
problem with my wife is?

25:28.777 --> 25:30.478
I've forgotten the details.

25:30.545 --> 25:32.914
Because of your memory issue,
without meaning to,

25:32.982 --> 25:34.082
you got a little angry.

25:34.149 --> 25:35.316
With Esther?

25:35.383 --> 25:36.618
Yeah.

25:36.685 --> 25:38.653
She's a saint.

25:38.721 --> 25:42.123
What I've put her through...

25:42.190 --> 25:45.092
It's not you, Roy. It's the condition.

25:45.159 --> 25:46.559
Son of a bitch.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.629
If-if another guy did
the same thing to his wife,

25:48.696 --> 25:50.897
I'd say lock him up!

25:52.466 --> 25:53.900
Hey. Uh, ninth floor, guys.

25:53.968 --> 25:55.836
- Yeah.
- We'll be right up.

25:55.903 --> 25:58.338
- Just with these gentlemen
here, Mr. Goldbach.
- Mm.

25:59.507 --> 26:02.908
Uh, I have a tee off
time tomorrow, 8:00 A.M.

26:02.976 --> 26:05.310
We'll get you there.

26:16.456 --> 26:18.156
Dr. Murphy.

26:19.491 --> 26:21.826
My office, when you have a moment.

26:28.734 --> 26:32.203
Let's try increasing the frequency.

26:32.271 --> 26:34.504
Nothing.

26:34.572 --> 26:37.340
The electrodes have been
in almost two hours.

26:37.408 --> 26:39.376
I know. It's a disappointment.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.514
I got your page.

26:44.582 --> 26:46.083
Was there activity?

26:46.151 --> 26:49.518
We've been... zapping different
areas of Charlie's brain.

26:49.586 --> 26:51.688
There's been a host of activity...

26:51.755 --> 26:53.656
Good. That's good.

26:53.724 --> 26:57.026
But none inducing arousal.

26:57.094 --> 27:00.129
Well, what is it doing?

27:00.197 --> 27:03.700
That's the thing. I don't know.

27:03.767 --> 27:05.500
And I don't like not knowing.

27:05.568 --> 27:08.670
Well, then just stimulate
another part of his brain.

27:08.738 --> 27:10.572
Okay, what part?

27:10.639 --> 27:12.240
I don't know. I'm not a neurosurgeon.

27:12.308 --> 27:14.542
Alex, I can't keep randomly
sticking electrodes

27:14.610 --> 27:16.712
into Charlie's brain without
risking brain damage.

27:16.779 --> 27:18.880
Shahir, you can't give up on us, please.

27:18.948 --> 27:22.649
The chances of hitting
a vein or an artery...

27:22.684 --> 27:25.086
This is our last shot.

27:28.724 --> 27:31.625
Shahir, please. I..

27:31.693 --> 27:34.095
It can't be over.

27:36.764 --> 27:38.732
It's too dangerous.

27:41.135 --> 27:44.437
I'm taking the electrodes out. I'm sorry.

27:56.549 --> 27:59.584
Hey. Mind if I sit?

28:06.524 --> 28:07.892
How's Charlie?

28:10.763 --> 28:13.264
It's not over.

28:13.331 --> 28:14.932
Feels like it is.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.301
Shahir's taking out the electrodes.
Another failure.

28:22.173 --> 28:24.074
I don't have any more fight left.

28:25.316 --> 28:27.110
Yeah, you do.

28:29.147 --> 28:30.847
You don't have to be nice.

28:30.915 --> 28:32.014
I know.

28:39.856 --> 28:42.124
Get out of here.

28:42.192 --> 28:44.093
Go fight.

28:59.667 --> 29:01.226
I want you to keep going.

29:01.294 --> 29:03.461
And if you can't or won't do it,

29:03.528 --> 29:06.397
I will find somebody who will,
but I'd rather it was you.

29:08.266 --> 29:10.734
Now what part of the brain
controls consciousness?

29:10.802 --> 29:12.246
Okay, there are several.

29:12.504 --> 29:15.297
But in this trajectory,
there's the pedunculopontine nucleus.

29:15.460 --> 29:16.382
Then let's go there.

29:16.491 --> 29:17.908
Alex, because of the location,

29:17.976 --> 29:19.575
there's a chance it could kill him.

29:19.643 --> 29:21.244
You won't.

29:23.147 --> 29:25.615
I've never been that deep
in the midbrain before.

29:25.682 --> 29:28.751
Then don't say I've never
done anything for you.

29:31.022 --> 29:34.689
This will be our last chance.

29:34.757 --> 29:35.957
Do you understand?

29:39.329 --> 29:42.964
Okay, I'm setting
the coordinates for the P.P.N.

29:56.045 --> 29:58.112
Come in.

29:59.033 --> 30:01.215
And close the door behind you.

30:05.083 --> 30:08.321
Well, I've committed Mr. Goldbach.

30:08.389 --> 30:10.123
Okay.

30:12.160 --> 30:14.227
What you did today

30:14.295 --> 30:15.695
when so far beyond the call of duty

30:15.763 --> 30:17.634
in such... such a wrong-headed way.

30:17.747 --> 30:18.529
I was just trying to help.

30:18.629 --> 30:19.755
Well, you didn't.

30:20.191 --> 30:21.545
I think this new treatment
model has merit.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.724
I'm not interested in
what you think, Gavin.

30:23.902 --> 30:26.214
You don't want your
residents to have opinions?

30:26.314 --> 30:28.074
Not at the moment, no.

30:28.141 --> 30:29.508
You gave out your cell phone number.

30:29.576 --> 30:30.828
You received a call from a patient...

30:30.928 --> 30:33.587
A call you never told me about.
Two rules broken.

30:33.687 --> 30:34.361
Dr. Druckerman, we...

30:34.461 --> 30:36.987
Then you left hospital property
while you were still on call.

30:37.087 --> 30:38.154
That's number three.

30:38.254 --> 30:39.917
You missed a consult. There's four.

30:39.985 --> 30:41.987
You walked into their home...

30:44.190 --> 30:46.858
I mean, the risk you took
going into their home...

30:48.383 --> 30:50.542
Do I need to keep going here or...

30:54.666 --> 30:56.366
You need to talk to the wife

30:56.434 --> 31:00.638
And you explain to her
where we go from here.

31:03.075 --> 31:05.375
Of course.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.783
I'm late for rounds with Kinney.

31:13.851 --> 31:15.986
- I'm screwed.
- Mm. Hmm.

31:16.455 --> 31:18.154
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

31:18.222 --> 31:19.589
No.

31:19.657 --> 31:21.357
I don't know.

31:21.976 --> 31:23.563
What's up?

31:23.961 --> 31:25.328
Thank you for coming.

31:25.664 --> 31:27.420
You... it was a complete disaster,

31:27.520 --> 31:30.165
but you had my back, so...

31:30.233 --> 31:32.267
I owe you one.

31:32.335 --> 31:34.737
Then dump your new girlfriend.

31:34.804 --> 31:35.904
Sorry.

31:35.972 --> 31:37.740
Dump her. Marry me.

31:37.807 --> 31:40.075
We'll be together 60 years.

31:41.744 --> 31:43.377
Gotta burn it.

31:53.448 --> 31:54.438
You're awake.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.423
I don't sleep much. It's a jockey thing.

31:56.491 --> 31:58.725
I shouldn't have operated.

31:59.067 --> 32:00.861
I asked you to.

32:00.928 --> 32:02.095
Begged you to.

32:02.163 --> 32:03.803
Right, but it was my decision,

32:03.903 --> 32:06.166
and my decision has now cost...

32:06.233 --> 32:08.601
My legs.

32:09.140 --> 32:10.036
You can say it.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.972
Stacey,

32:12.040 --> 32:15.507
you will recover some
more feeling in your legs.

32:15.575 --> 32:16.876
It...

32:17.170 --> 32:18.744
They say there's even a 20% chance

32:18.812 --> 32:20.046
that you'll be able walk again.

32:20.113 --> 32:23.149
4 to 1 against. I've beaten longer odds.

32:24.751 --> 32:26.786
But I'm never gonna ride again.

32:28.621 --> 32:29.888
I'm afraid not.

32:29.955 --> 32:34.793
You followed your gut...

32:34.860 --> 32:36.627
unlike me.

32:37.752 --> 32:40.098
Trainer asked me to choke off my colt,

32:40.166 --> 32:42.333
make my move late up the rail,

32:42.401 --> 32:44.335
even though he knew that's
not the way I like to ride.

32:46.470 --> 32:49.073
I didn't follow my instincts,
and it cost...

32:50.809 --> 32:52.109
everything.

33:01.785 --> 33:05.988
Why am I not waking up?!

33:24.841 --> 33:27.575
Hey, Charlie.

33:27.643 --> 33:29.711
Why don't you wanna wake up?

33:31.147 --> 33:32.781
Stop!

33:32.849 --> 33:34.882
Look at that.

33:36.752 --> 33:37.852
Is everything okay?

33:37.919 --> 33:39.419
- No.
- What?

33:39.911 --> 33:41.622
I mean, that is a very strange signal.

33:41.689 --> 33:42.689
Are we stopping?

33:42.758 --> 33:44.091
No.

33:44.159 --> 33:45.692
Shahir, talk to me.

33:46.795 --> 33:49.363
Something is happening to
the signals in his midbrain.

33:49.430 --> 33:52.698
Something... I've never seen before.

33:54.334 --> 33:55.835
Okay.

33:55.903 --> 33:57.703
Okay.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.743
Mm. How's Roy?

34:18.811 --> 34:21.679
Good. Yeah, they gave him
something to go to sleep.

34:21.746 --> 34:24.715
Uh, they knocked him out, huh?

34:24.783 --> 34:25.984
Well, that's good.

34:28.520 --> 34:30.420
Yeah. Uh...

34:30.489 --> 34:31.755
Heard you broke your hip.

34:32.639 --> 34:34.658
Well, the rite of passage.

34:34.726 --> 34:37.228
All my friends are doing it.

34:37.607 --> 34:38.728
So...

34:39.007 --> 34:41.197
Soon as I get better,

34:41.264 --> 34:42.699
I can bring him home.

34:42.766 --> 34:43.900
Hmm.

34:45.614 --> 34:47.260
- Esther...
- Don't say it.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.806
Roy needs supervision.
He needs 24-hour care.

34:50.875 --> 34:53.909
I'm his wife. I'm his care.

34:53.978 --> 34:55.744
He belongs with me.

34:55.812 --> 34:57.980
He needs to be in a safe environment,

34:58.048 --> 34:59.482
for both of you.

34:59.549 --> 35:01.484
We took vows, you know?

35:01.730 --> 35:03.885
Till death do us part,

35:05.022 --> 35:06.722
even if...

35:06.789 --> 35:11.092
even if we can't remember who
the hell the other person was.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.428
Esther, there's an excellent care facility

35:13.496 --> 35:15.296
that's not far from your house.

35:15.364 --> 35:18.833
But what if I refuse and
I take him home anyway?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.801
Then the next time something happens,

35:20.869 --> 35:22.603
we're obliged to call the police.

35:23.806 --> 35:25.328
Roy goes into the system.

35:26.039 --> 35:27.174
You don't want that.

35:27.242 --> 35:29.109
No.

35:31.930 --> 35:34.581
Can I spend one last...

35:34.649 --> 35:36.450
night with him?

35:37.883 --> 35:39.619
He's in a locked ward.

35:39.687 --> 35:42.989
I know, but he's been
drugged out of his mind.

35:43.057 --> 35:45.525
So, you know...

35:45.592 --> 35:48.794
He won't be violent. Mm?

35:48.862 --> 35:51.230
I'm sorry.

35:51.298 --> 35:53.399
It-it's against the rules.

35:55.969 --> 36:00.305
God, I've tried so hard for so long

36:00.373 --> 36:02.708
to think, you know, for both of us.

36:56.392 --> 36:58.728
What are you looking at?

36:58.795 --> 37:00.896
Patient advocate web site.

37:00.964 --> 37:06.134
Couldn't you say "porn" just once?

37:06.201 --> 37:08.937
You're such a good boy.

37:15.177 --> 37:16.711
Not that good.

37:16.779 --> 37:19.480
Is that right?

37:19.548 --> 37:21.581
Couple of, uh, first-year residents

37:21.650 --> 37:23.583
are gonna go get beers. You wanna go?

37:23.652 --> 37:26.020
Nah, I think I'd rather stay here.

37:26.087 --> 37:29.156
And look at nerdy web sites all night?

37:29.223 --> 37:31.725
Nope.

37:31.793 --> 37:34.461
Then do what?

37:36.531 --> 37:38.298
I don't know.

37:38.366 --> 37:39.899
Maybe...

37:43.171 --> 37:45.372
start our 60 years off right.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.993
- What can I do for you?
- Let me do my job.

38:09.778 --> 38:12.197
You make that very
difficult sometimes, Joel.

38:12.264 --> 38:15.933
And that's not gonna change.

38:17.769 --> 38:21.439
If you can't let me
make my own decisions...

38:21.507 --> 38:23.308
Then what?

38:23.375 --> 38:25.576
Then you should fire me.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.114
I'm not gonna fire you, Joel,

38:31.182 --> 38:34.351
but if you think I am going to let you

38:34.419 --> 38:37.454
do whatever the hell you want,
then you're crazy.

38:37.522 --> 38:39.923
Then I quit.

38:41.791 --> 38:43.992
Joel!

38:46.496 --> 38:49.432
Okay, we got a significant
response from the P.P.N.

38:49.499 --> 38:51.066
Let us stay on this trajectory.

38:51.134 --> 38:53.869
Can we increase the amplitude
to 3 volts, please?

38:56.972 --> 38:59.907
Nothing's happening.

38:59.975 --> 39:01.376
4 volts.

39:01.444 --> 39:03.678
Dr. Hamza, you're gonna fry his brain.

39:03.746 --> 39:05.580
Shahir.

39:05.648 --> 39:07.181
4 volts.

39:08.584 --> 39:09.917
Come on, Charlie.

39:09.985 --> 39:12.753
Charlie.

39:12.820 --> 39:15.422
Come on, baby, you can do this.

39:33.407 --> 39:35.908
Looks like you've been
in quite an accident.

39:37.778 --> 39:39.479
Um...

39:39.546 --> 39:42.482
Get your license and registration, sir.

39:46.352 --> 39:47.653
I wasn't driving.

39:47.720 --> 39:51.122
Well, I've seen quite a few of these.

39:51.190 --> 39:52.491
You're lucky to...

39:54.026 --> 39:56.395
You're bleeding.

40:00.999 --> 40:04.468
Do I know you?

40:04.536 --> 40:07.471
Sergeant Howard.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.940
Jimmy.

40:10.008 --> 40:11.676
I didn't do anything wrong.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.111
Of course not.

40:14.179 --> 40:15.913
No, I just need to ask
you a few questions.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.616
Hey, you have any, uh...

40:19.684 --> 40:21.551
Children? No.

40:21.619 --> 40:22.719
Good.

40:22.787 --> 40:25.856
'Cause what's out there...

40:25.924 --> 40:28.258
Let me tell ya.

40:28.326 --> 40:31.594
Nothing but backstabbers,
scumbags, and lies.

40:33.363 --> 40:34.730
Charlie?

40:40.470 --> 40:42.705
Did you hear that?

40:42.772 --> 40:44.807
You're better off coming with me.

40:44.875 --> 40:47.243
Charlie.

40:47.311 --> 40:48.910
Alex?!

40:48.978 --> 40:50.511
No.

40:52.315 --> 40:55.917
You're just tired, Charlie.

40:59.521 --> 41:01.223
I am.

41:03.025 --> 41:05.326
I know.

41:05.393 --> 41:08.195
It's been a long road
with no turning back.

41:10.565 --> 41:11.966
Come on.

41:16.437 --> 41:18.939
Where we going, Jimmy?

41:19.007 --> 41:21.941
Home.

41:22.009 --> 41:23.743
Time to go home.

41:28.281 --> 41:30.548
That's Alex.

41:30.616 --> 41:34.753
You come with me. It's the best thing.

41:37.357 --> 41:38.891
Come on.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.101
I have to go, Jimmy.

41:50.168 --> 41:51.369
Charlie.

41:51.436 --> 41:54.505
I have to go.

41:54.572 --> 41:56.274
I have to go.

42:21.898 --> 42:23.765
Take it to 5 volts.

42:46.621 --> 42:48.822
Alex.
