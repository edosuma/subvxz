00:37.737 --> 00:39.069
Unh!

00:42.735 --> 00:44.067
Come on!

00:44.766 --> 00:46.000
Ohh!

00:49.265 --> 00:52.763
You know the best thing
about the life we lead is?

00:52.764 --> 00:54.228
No.

00:54.229 --> 00:56.127
But I got a feeling
you're about to tell me.

00:56.128 --> 00:57.295
Money, of course.

00:57.296 --> 00:58.493
The worst?

00:58.494 --> 01:01.026
Well, the price
we all have to pay.

01:01.027 --> 01:03.424
To sacrifice our loved ones.

01:03.425 --> 01:04.992
And for what?

01:05.456 --> 01:07.390
Richie ain't nothing,

01:07.391 --> 01:10.222
And richie ain't been nothing
for a real long time.

01:10.223 --> 01:12.054
I hear he can't even throw
a knife no more

01:12.055 --> 01:13.221
Without cutting himself up.

01:13.222 --> 01:15.455
Must be a mess
when he jerks off.

01:20.285 --> 01:24.716
A life filled with exotic
pleasures is nothing...

01:24.717 --> 01:27.715
Without peace of mind.

01:27.716 --> 01:31.713
You can have both, seth,
at el rey.

01:31.714 --> 01:33.379
What is el rey?

01:33.380 --> 01:35.445
Taco stand in baja?

01:35.446 --> 01:38.310
It is south of your border...

01:38.311 --> 01:39.477
On a mountain...

01:39.478 --> 01:41.009
Mm.
...Near the ocean.

01:41.010 --> 01:43.008
Sounds like paradise.

01:43.009 --> 01:45.242
I don't believe in paradise.

01:52.372 --> 01:54.703
For people like
you and richard,

01:54.704 --> 01:57.237
Heaven is not having
to look over your shoulder.

01:58.968 --> 02:03.032
El rey offers a safety...

02:03.033 --> 02:05.965
Anonymity, and protection.

02:05.966 --> 02:07.397
Protection?

02:07.398 --> 02:08.697
Yeah.

02:08.698 --> 02:11.429
And this protection is free?

02:11.430 --> 02:13.195
30% of your take.

02:13.196 --> 02:16.694
It was real nice meeting you,
carlito.

02:16.695 --> 02:19.026
Unh!
One of these days,

02:19.027 --> 02:21.294
That retard brother of yours
is gonna get you killed.

02:23.692 --> 02:26.289
Peace of mind...

02:26.290 --> 02:29.688
Is something
your brother needs.

02:29.689 --> 02:31.954
He has not been well, has he?

02:31.955 --> 02:33.719
Okay, what do you want from me
exactly?

02:33.720 --> 02:35.421
The world never gave you
anything.

02:35.422 --> 02:38.351
All the world ever did
was take.

02:38.352 --> 02:41.283
So what do you do
in return?
Take it back.

02:41.284 --> 02:44.049
That's right.
We take it back.

02:44.050 --> 02:46.181
But this time,
we take it back, seth,

02:46.182 --> 02:48.015
And keep it...

02:48.980 --> 02:51.114
For eternity.

03:04.674 --> 03:06.306
I'm gonna go get us a room.

03:06.307 --> 03:09.041
Be right back.

04:02.649 --> 04:04.917
Hmm.

04:31.936 --> 04:33.302
Ugh!

04:33.303 --> 04:35.436
Aah!
Please!
No, no, no!

04:58.626 --> 05:01.624
I'm in the middle of something,
guero.

05:01.625 --> 05:03.923
This is the last time
I'm gonna call you.
You want to know why?

05:03.924 --> 05:05.355
'cause you're gonna tell me
where you set up

05:05.356 --> 05:06.988
That border crossing.
You sound upset.

05:06.989 --> 05:08.421
Things not going as planned?

05:08.422 --> 05:10.087
No, carlito, they are not.

05:10.088 --> 05:12.186
We got half the state of texas
looking for us,

05:12.187 --> 05:13.620
And I can't cross the border

05:13.621 --> 05:15.620
With a ticking time bomb
sitting next to me.

05:15.621 --> 05:17.217
What's the matter with richard?

05:17.218 --> 05:19.116
Look, you got a guy
on the border or not?

05:19.117 --> 05:20.350
He's at the acuña crossing.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.414
He'll give you passage tonight.

05:22.415 --> 05:25.247
Wait, tonight?
When?

05:25.248 --> 05:27.146
10:00. Trust me.

05:27.147 --> 05:29.045
Night is better.

05:29.046 --> 05:31.146
Look, I got something I got
to take care of before we cross.

05:31.147 --> 05:34.177
Now you just tell me that
you're not gonna bail on me.

05:34.178 --> 05:35.342
Because if you bail on me,

05:35.343 --> 05:37.310
I'm gonna bail
on your mexican ass.

05:37.311 --> 05:39.041
You understand that?
Seth.

05:39.042 --> 05:40.107
What?

05:40.108 --> 05:42.208
I'm not mexican.

06:39.582 --> 06:41.182
<i>Richie.</i>

06:51.311 --> 06:52.978
Goddamn state's
bigger than hell.

06:55.175 --> 06:59.173
10:00 tonight
we cross, and miss...

06:59.174 --> 07:00.573
monica.

07:00.574 --> 07:02.305
Miss monica here goes back
to her life.

07:02.306 --> 07:04.574
Until then, you are
an insurance policy, my dear.

07:04.575 --> 07:06.170
Do you understand?

07:06.171 --> 07:08.369
Good.
You didn't even try
and talk him down?

07:08.370 --> 07:10.869
Richard,
it's 30% to get into el rey.

07:10.870 --> 07:12.335
Eternity and bliss

07:12.336 --> 07:15.067
Drenched in the nectar
of the noble blue agave.

07:15.068 --> 07:17.969
Sounds like
a freaking buñuel movie.

07:20.298 --> 07:21.897
The hell is this?

07:21.898 --> 07:23.298
That is
a budd boetticher picture.

07:23.299 --> 07:24.930
And it's all you're gonna get.

07:24.931 --> 07:26.862
All right, I need thing one
and thing two

07:26.863 --> 07:28.060
In case I get into a scrape.

07:28.061 --> 07:29.962
You're not going out there.
That's crazy.

07:29.963 --> 07:31.993
Got to ditch and switch,
and we got to eat.

07:31.994 --> 07:35.825
I can't do anything with
quick draw's...Shriveled member.

07:35.826 --> 07:37.558
You're not gonna need anything

07:37.559 --> 07:40.589
Because miss monica here is the
best damn teller in the west.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.289
She knows all about
customer service.

07:43.290 --> 07:47.020
Now, what is the, uh...

07:47.021 --> 07:49.985
First rule of customer service,
monica?

07:49.986 --> 07:52.320
The customer is always right.

07:54.917 --> 07:56.550
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

07:56.551 --> 07:59.282
Now, you see...

07:59.283 --> 08:03.846
Me and richie here, we are
your most loyal customers.

08:03.847 --> 08:08.111
And we only want one thing...
for you to sit there...

08:08.112 --> 08:10.345
And not move.

08:12.543 --> 08:14.308
Got it?

08:14.309 --> 08:16.941
You got it, richie?

08:16.942 --> 08:18.842
Just get me a burger already.

08:22.071 --> 08:25.140
And some, uh,
sweet-potato fries.

08:32.833 --> 08:36.131
<i>What a day!
Boy, do I feel great!</i>

08:36.133 --> 08:37.265
<i>I think I'll go to the mall.</i>

08:46.896 --> 08:48.194
You stay put.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.862
<i>Sure, that's a fact!</i>

08:58.923 --> 09:01.022
This is a bad idea, daddy.

09:01.023 --> 09:03.888
Scott barely has his learner's.

09:03.889 --> 09:05.987
Scott, keep your eyes
on the road.

09:05.988 --> 09:09.851
Katey, why don't you sit back?

09:09.852 --> 09:11.518
Use that fancy phone of yours

09:11.519 --> 09:14.183
To find us the best place
to cross the border.

09:14.184 --> 09:16.782
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said

09:16.783 --> 09:18.181
Back there with kyle.

09:18.182 --> 09:21.846
It's just that we didn't know

09:21.847 --> 09:23.847
That you left the congregation
for good or...

09:23.848 --> 09:26.011
That you stopped believing
in god.

09:26.012 --> 09:29.113
I never said that.

09:31.010 --> 09:33.075
Losing your mother's been tough
on all of us.

09:33.076 --> 09:35.309
I just feel like we need
to spend some time together

09:35.310 --> 09:38.240
As a family...
To do some searching.

09:38.241 --> 09:39.773
That's all.

09:39.774 --> 09:41.006
Maybe find a new path
or a new driver.

09:43.038 --> 09:44.972
Watch it!

09:46.237 --> 09:48.835
This is a bad idea.

09:48.836 --> 09:51.001
Maybe if she'd shut her hole,
I could focus.

09:51.002 --> 09:53.800
Son, a hole is a pit
in the ground.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.098
Don't talk to your sister
that way

09:55.099 --> 09:56.500
Or anyone for that matter.

09:56.501 --> 10:00.097
Daddy, all you've told us
our entire lives

10:00.098 --> 10:01.796
Is to trust in god.

10:01.797 --> 10:04.495
I know.

10:04.496 --> 10:06.195
But right now,
I need you to trust

10:06.196 --> 10:07.960
In the pagan power
of technology

10:07.961 --> 10:09.960
And please look up
that border crossing.

10:09.961 --> 10:12.791
You don't give up on god.

10:12.792 --> 10:14.091
You don't give up on him

10:14.092 --> 10:16.790
Because he would never ever
give up on you.

10:16.791 --> 10:21.987
Kate, I spent my entire
adult life serving the lord.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.856
I know exactly
what he's capable of.

10:28.252 --> 10:30.819
T-that...
that wasn't me.

10:37.148 --> 10:40.080
Oh, this sucks.

10:40.081 --> 10:42.849
Right when I started driving.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.207
What are you doing?

10:54.208 --> 10:55.940
I'm looking for the toolbox.

10:55.941 --> 10:57.173
It's not in here.

10:57.174 --> 10:59.971
It's not anywhere.
I never bought one.

10:59.972 --> 11:01.805
Maybe they got something.

11:15.465 --> 11:16.964
All right.

11:16.965 --> 11:19.197
You stay in the r.V.

11:19.198 --> 11:22.462
Go on.

11:22.463 --> 11:23.829
Get inside!

11:34.857 --> 11:37.025
Get you something, darlin'?

11:52.049 --> 11:53.449
Excuse me, folks!

11:53.450 --> 11:55.848
My vehicle decided to quit
on me.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.784
I'm no expert, but it appears
to be some sort of busted hose.

12:13.207 --> 12:16.206
Aloha. Welcome to
the big kahuna burger.

12:16.207 --> 12:18.708
Would you like to try
our special agent utah meal?

12:24.835 --> 12:26.069

12:55.057 --> 12:57.422
This...Couch is nice.

12:57.423 --> 13:00.891
You're not safe there.

13:39.071 --> 13:41.003
Thanks for coming out,
professor.

13:41.004 --> 13:42.136
No problem.

13:42.137 --> 13:44.402
Austin says you've been doing

13:44.403 --> 13:46.069
Some great things
with this cartel-killer case.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.134
Think I might've found them.

13:48.135 --> 13:49.866
Really?
Yeah.

13:49.867 --> 13:52.067
It's part of the bank-robbery
crew... gecko brothers.

13:52.068 --> 13:53.864
Like the james gang.

13:53.865 --> 13:54.997
There's only two of them.

13:54.998 --> 13:56.731
I wouldn't exactly call that
a gang.

13:56.732 --> 13:58.795
Great, so we got that settled.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.395
I've been tracking these guys.

14:00.396 --> 14:02.729
Been finding symbols that might
have something to do

14:02.730 --> 14:05.859
With these crazy little gods
these cartels like to worship.

14:05.860 --> 14:08.991
Crazy little gods?
Okay.

14:08.992 --> 14:11.090
Before we go any further,

14:11.091 --> 14:13.390
We're gonna have to set up some
ground rules, okay, sheriff?

14:13.391 --> 14:15.858
I'm not a sheriff.
Yeah,
and I don't spend my days

14:15.859 --> 14:18.820
Looking at pictures of people
with bones through their noses.

14:18.821 --> 14:22.818
These "crazy little gods"...
Are my life's work.

14:22.819 --> 14:26.983
If I said something insensitive,
I apologize.

14:26.984 --> 14:29.849
What I meant to say was,

14:29.850 --> 14:34.080
I'm trailing two murderous
thieves that killed eight men...

14:34.081 --> 14:36.749
Including my mentor.

14:38.112 --> 14:41.810
So, what makes you so certain
they're connected to the cartel?

14:41.811 --> 14:43.745
A symbol that shows up
at every murder.

14:46.409 --> 14:48.710
I found it again today.

14:52.873 --> 14:54.871
Something wrong, professor?

14:54.872 --> 14:56.371
Excuse me, folks!

14:56.372 --> 14:58.104
My vehicle just quit on me.

14:58.105 --> 15:01.369
I'm no expert, but it appears
to be some sort of busted hose.

15:01.370 --> 15:04.101
Perhaps someone here
could help me arrange

15:04.102 --> 15:05.835
Some sort of jury-rig
to keep going...

15:05.836 --> 15:08.066
Let him call aaa.
...At least long enough for me

15:08.067 --> 15:09.967
To get it to the nearest
service station.

15:09.968 --> 15:11.365
Where'd you find this?

15:11.366 --> 15:14.364
Off my partner's dead body.

15:14.365 --> 15:15.662
They used it on him.

15:15.663 --> 15:17.097
Think he found it at the scene.

15:17.098 --> 15:18.828
I guess you're the chosen one.

15:18.829 --> 15:22.127
This is an ancient weapon used
in ritual sacrifice.

15:22.128 --> 15:24.359
It's been written about.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.125
Never seen.

15:26.126 --> 15:28.391
This should not exist.

15:28.392 --> 15:30.357
So, how is that supposed
to help me find these boys?

15:30.358 --> 15:32.091
Well, it lets you know
who you're dealing with.

15:32.092 --> 15:35.754
This cartel clearly worships
the vision serpent.

15:35.755 --> 15:37.853
They're
the waxaklahun ubah kan,

15:37.854 --> 15:40.685
Or, in common español,
los culebras.

15:40.686 --> 15:42.818
Serpents.
Yeah.

15:42.819 --> 15:44.619
So, what does that have to do
with the eye?

15:44.620 --> 15:46.983
Well,
the eye-in-hand motif

15:46.984 --> 15:50.748
Appears in codices
going back 3,000 years.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.081
Represents
the two most important gifts

15:53.082 --> 15:55.146
A god can bequeath on a man...

15:55.147 --> 15:58.345
The ability to see
and the ability to take action.

15:58.346 --> 16:01.747
You can guess [sighs] what kind
of action this was used for.

17:02.718 --> 17:04.351
Are you okay?

17:11.946 --> 17:14.079
You know, I'm not just
some dipshit triggerman

17:14.079 --> 17:16.644
Who screams at bank tellers
to open their drawers.

17:16.645 --> 17:18.345
I am a scientist,
a master tactician.

17:18.346 --> 17:20.077
I am a lock artist.

17:20.078 --> 17:22.742
Oh, I-I know.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.775
I know that.
And this is what I do.

17:24.776 --> 17:26.709
When something doesn't
make sense, this is what I do.

17:26.710 --> 17:28.174
I figure it out.

17:30.606 --> 17:34.771
You know, my... my son, he,
um... he does the same thing.

17:34.772 --> 17:37.036
I-I have two kids.

17:37.037 --> 17:39.302
They're 17 and... and 7.

17:39.303 --> 17:44.699
My boy, rafa, I call him
my little aubelito 'cause...

17:44.700 --> 17:46.798
He's such an old soul.

17:46.799 --> 17:50.297
He complains about the weather.

17:50.298 --> 17:55.768
I mean, w-what kid complains
about the weather?

17:57.794 --> 17:59.762
He likes to draw, too.

18:01.294 --> 18:03.027
C-can I see?

18:31.946 --> 18:34.581
You... you have a gift.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.906
I didn't think you'd show up.

18:49.907 --> 18:51.671
Yeah, we, uh...
we got a little waylaid.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.038
We shouldn't be sitting here,
okay?

18:53.039 --> 18:55.537
You're all over the news.
Are you gonna order something?

18:55.538 --> 18:57.004
Yeah, I-in a second.
Now, vanessa, I...

18:57.005 --> 18:58.801
Where's richie...
in the car?

18:58.802 --> 19:02.000
No, we're, uh... we're laying
low in a motel nearby.

19:02.001 --> 19:04.732
Okay, now just...
just listen to me, honey. Um...

19:04.733 --> 19:08.064
Plan's changed.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.796
Changed?
Yeah.

19:09.797 --> 19:12.595
Plans don't change.
Isn't that what you always say?

19:12.596 --> 19:14.062
No matter what,
you stick to the plan.

19:14.063 --> 19:16.627
We meet here, we cross together.
That's how we designed it.

19:16.628 --> 19:18.527
Yes, um...

19:18.528 --> 19:19.760
But what I failed to mention

19:19.761 --> 19:23.291
Is that sometimes
plans get better.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.856
What's better than you and me
on a beach in cancún?

19:25.857 --> 19:29.855
You being alive for one.

19:29.856 --> 19:31.656
What's that?

19:33.687 --> 19:35.053
That's how the plan
gets better.

19:36.819 --> 19:39.684
All right, now, that's over
$4 million in bearer bonds.

19:39.685 --> 19:40.951
All right,
now, you're gonna take this

19:40.952 --> 19:43.682
To warren pritchard
at k.C. Financial.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.014
He's gonna convert it for you,

19:45.015 --> 19:47.250
Then he's gonna wash the money
all nice and clean.

19:47.251 --> 19:50.280
Honey, after that,
you're gonna be set.

19:50.281 --> 19:53.712
You understand?
You're not gonna need a thing.

19:53.713 --> 19:55.844
For me?

19:55.845 --> 19:56.843
Yes.

19:56.844 --> 19:58.243
All of it?
Every cent.

19:58.244 --> 19:59.875
He's not even gonna charge you
a fee.

19:59.876 --> 20:01.643
I'm gonna take care of that.
Don't worry about it.

20:01.644 --> 20:04.840
Babe, t-that's...

20:04.841 --> 20:06.873
Right?
It feels like vegas in here.

20:06.874 --> 20:08.838
And I can hear
the bells dinging.

20:08.839 --> 20:10.672
I feel like one
of those obese ladies

20:10.673 --> 20:12.704
Sliding quarters
into a big old plastic cup.

20:12.705 --> 20:16.535
Just me and my fat ass,
you know, swallowing up a chair.

20:16.536 --> 20:19.534
Well...
wow.

20:19.535 --> 20:21.533
You remember
our honeymoon?
Yeah, yeah.

20:21.534 --> 20:23.834
That... that time I won at
keno... at keno in the bellagio?

20:23.835 --> 20:25.631
You remember that?
Yes, yes.

20:25.632 --> 20:26.764
It was 4:00 in the morning.

20:26.765 --> 20:28.563
I'll never forget it

20:28.564 --> 20:31.629
Because this, uh... this call
girl took the table next to us.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.761
Oh, yeah.

20:32.762 --> 20:34.261
She had just come down...
Uh-huh.

20:34.262 --> 20:36.527
From doing her business
upstairs, and she ordered...

20:36.528 --> 20:37.959
I'll never forget this...

20:37.960 --> 20:39.827
She ordered a short stack of
buttermilks and a black coffee.

20:39.828 --> 20:41.524
Yeah.

20:41.525 --> 20:42.958
You remember what you said?

20:42.959 --> 20:45.690
No, no, I don't.
What did I say?

20:45.691 --> 20:48.792
You said, "I guess
that's what the whores eat."

20:50.820 --> 20:54.686
I thought to myself...
"how must that feel?

20:54.687 --> 20:57.817
"how must it feel for her
to walk into that cafeteria

20:57.818 --> 20:59.816
"and know
that everyone there knows

20:59.817 --> 21:01.250
"that she sleeps with people
for money?

21:01.251 --> 21:04.014
"how must it feel
when everyone in the room

21:04.015 --> 21:06.614
Knows that
you're a whore."

21:06.615 --> 21:08.546
I guess I know now.

21:08.547 --> 21:09.680
Vanessa, I swear...

21:09.681 --> 21:11.811
I am a whore,
and I am not your bitch.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.511
You know what I am, seth?

21:13.512 --> 21:15.210
I'm your partner,
and you know what partners do?

21:15.211 --> 21:16.610
They make plans,
and they honor those plans,

21:16.611 --> 21:18.008
And they stick to them.

21:18.009 --> 21:19.709
Okay, honey, I know that.
That's not...

21:19.710 --> 21:22.507
Did you forget that I cased
that bank for three weeks?

21:22.508 --> 21:24.539
Yeah.
That I knew
every teller's schedule

21:24.540 --> 21:26.505
Upside down, inside out?

21:26.506 --> 21:28.237
That I knew that
they would be stocking that atm

21:28.238 --> 21:29.703
When you pushed your way in?

21:29.704 --> 21:31.536
It is not my fault
that you and your brother

21:31.537 --> 21:32.935
Are the most wanted fugitives
in the world right now.

21:32.936 --> 21:34.002
That is on you.

21:34.003 --> 21:35.601
Okay, but that is exactly why

21:35.602 --> 21:37.533
That we need to cross alone
right now.

21:37.534 --> 21:39.702
Do you understand that?
I baked you a carrot cake

21:39.703 --> 21:41.998
Every year with
real cream-cheese frosting.

21:41.999 --> 21:44.198
What?
I lit candles, blew them out.

21:44.199 --> 21:45.797
Honey, I know.
I know you did.

21:45.798 --> 21:47.765
Five times, five years.

21:48.995 --> 21:52.694
You think all that time
I was waiting for some money?

21:52.695 --> 21:55.493
I was waiting for you.

21:55.494 --> 21:56.760
Because I love you.

22:08.788 --> 22:10.888
You ready?

22:15.852 --> 22:17.750
You okay?

22:17.751 --> 22:21.782
Bet you don't use patrón
on your kids' scrapes.

22:21.783 --> 22:24.914
Neosporin.

22:24.915 --> 22:26.948
The patrón's for me.

22:40.774 --> 22:43.672
<i>She wants to be free.</i>

22:43.673 --> 22:45.505
<i>She wants you.</i>

22:45.506 --> 22:48.541
Go sit down.
Do it now!

22:49.870 --> 22:52.569
Richie.

22:52.570 --> 22:56.567
Don't be afraid.

22:56.568 --> 22:58.699
Don't be nervous, baby.

22:58.700 --> 23:01.698
It's just us.

23:01.699 --> 23:03.764
It's just you...

23:03.765 --> 23:06.766
And your little gordita.

23:11.894 --> 23:13.461
You really want me?

23:15.192 --> 23:18.458
That is why you said that,
isn't it?

23:18.459 --> 23:20.659
I didn't say anything.

23:22.756 --> 23:24.755
Set me free, richard.

23:24.756 --> 23:26.654
Set me free.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.722
<i>Richie.</i>

23:31.952 --> 23:34.850
Who are you?
Who are you really?

23:34.851 --> 23:37.018
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:43.115 --> 23:45.080
Please,
I don't know what you want!

23:45.081 --> 23:46.747
You're playing some kind of game
with me.

23:46.748 --> 23:49.978
You think that I can't hear your
voice inside me head, gordita?!

23:49.979 --> 23:52.980
What did you call me?

23:55.410 --> 23:57.175
No, no!
See that?!

23:57.176 --> 23:59.407
Games, games, games.

23:59.408 --> 24:01.873
You think that you can
seduce me, but you can't.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.874
I didn't say anything!

24:11.802 --> 24:13.467
That's how I like it.

24:13.468 --> 24:15.033
<i>She wants to be free.</i>

24:15.034 --> 24:16.734
<i>She wants you.</i>

24:18.867 --> 24:21.031
Why do you got to be
such a byotch?

24:21.032 --> 24:22.131
I don't know.

24:22.132 --> 24:24.096
Because he's going against

24:24.097 --> 24:26.729
Everything he's ever believed
his entire life?

24:26.730 --> 24:28.530
And why do you keep asking dad
about the accident?

24:28.531 --> 24:30.094
What do you care?

24:30.095 --> 24:31.895
Sometimes you sound like
you think it's his fault.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.961
I never said that, scott.

24:35.958 --> 24:37.724
Scott...

24:37.725 --> 24:40.393
Okay, I'm sorry.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.088
I don't know how to do this.

24:43.089 --> 24:45.720
Do what?
Dad is losing it.

24:45.721 --> 24:47.953
He's not in a good place
right now.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.087
But we never had to worry about
that kind of stuff

24:50.088 --> 24:53.851
Because mom always knew
how to take care of him and us.

24:53.852 --> 24:56.117
I can't take her place.

24:56.118 --> 24:58.515
I don't know how to be mom.

24:58.516 --> 25:00.850
Then don't try to be.

25:06.978 --> 25:09.710
If my kids could see me now...

25:09.711 --> 25:11.443
They don't think
I'm that handy.

25:11.444 --> 25:12.710
Yeah, I'll bet the wife
don't, either.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.742
She not in the picture?

25:14.743 --> 25:16.007
She passed.

25:16.008 --> 25:19.706
Oh, sorry.
See, there I go prying again.

25:19.707 --> 25:20.904
My shelby, she'd tell me

25:20.905 --> 25:22.806
I'm chatting up
a complete stranger

25:22.807 --> 25:24.838
When I should be minding
my own business.

25:24.839 --> 25:27.836
Well, the shape this puppy's in,
I think, uh

25:27.837 --> 25:29.868
It's probably best
you don't share with your kids

25:29.869 --> 25:31.970
Precisely how many ways
from Sunday you are screwed.

25:33.801 --> 25:35.799
Yeah, I'd say this, uh,
little adventure you're on

25:35.800 --> 25:37.834
Might be cut a whole hell
of a lot shorter than you think.

25:37.835 --> 25:40.365
Aah! Aah!

25:40.366 --> 25:41.996
God damn it.

25:41.997 --> 25:43.730
God damn it!

25:43.731 --> 25:46.398
God damn it!

25:48.029 --> 25:49.695
What is going on out here?!

25:53.759 --> 25:56.824
We're just trying to knock
something back into place.

25:56.825 --> 25:59.058
It's all right.

26:01.089 --> 26:04.088
Hey, man, this puppy's got to,
uh, cool off for a little while.

26:04.089 --> 26:06.120
Why don't we head back
inside, man?

26:06.121 --> 26:08.755
We'll cool off ourselves, huh?

26:11.718 --> 26:12.851
Thank you.

26:15.682 --> 26:17.848
You and shelby have any kids?

26:17.849 --> 26:19.114
Well...

26:19.115 --> 26:20.880
We're working on it.

26:20.881 --> 26:22.946
I don't know if I'm ready
to be honest.

26:22.947 --> 26:25.079
Hang on to her.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.747
It's a team sport.

26:34.343 --> 26:35.809
Baby, you need
to understand something.

26:35.810 --> 26:38.976
You walk out...
You're walking out on us.

26:39.972 --> 26:41.473
We pulled a job...

26:42.438 --> 26:45.736
We pulled a job that net
$30 mil.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.802
You know what we could do
with that money?

26:47.803 --> 26:50.034
We could go get that bar that
you always wanted in the keys.

26:50.035 --> 26:52.002
That was stupid. That place
never would've worked.

26:52.003 --> 26:53.800
Like hell it wouldn't.

26:53.801 --> 26:56.832
It's still there, you know.
I checked.

26:56.833 --> 26:59.064
You checked?
Mm-hmm.

26:59.065 --> 27:01.665
All they want's
$1.5 million.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.995
Baby, we could take this money

27:05.996 --> 27:07.794
And go down and snatch it up.

27:07.795 --> 27:10.759
I can't do that to him.
He's my brother.

27:10.760 --> 27:11.959
Do what?
He's my brother.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.826
Give him $26 million?

27:19.357 --> 27:21.857
All right, listen to me.
Okay?

27:24.054 --> 27:27.752
There's a... there's a reason
that richie was always so good

27:27.753 --> 27:30.650
At figuring out jobs and stuff
for us, okay?

27:30.651 --> 27:33.916
36... 36 jobs we pulled.
Nobody could touch us.

27:33.917 --> 27:35.850
He's an egghead.
Yes, he's an egghead,

27:35.851 --> 27:37.914
But that's not
what I'm talking about.

27:37.915 --> 27:39.946
All right,
it's because of the old man.

27:39.947 --> 27:43.812
He used to make richie think,

27:43.813 --> 27:45.911
You know, keep him on his toes.

27:45.912 --> 27:48.777
At first, it started out
when we were really young,

27:48.778 --> 27:51.375
You know, stupid stuff,
just, like,

27:51.376 --> 27:53.408
Richie sneaking us past him
while he was asleep

27:53.409 --> 27:57.006
So we could watch cartoons,
you know, stuff like that.

27:57.007 --> 27:58.373
Then the old man
would get hammered,

27:58.374 --> 28:00.371
Knock us around a little bit.

28:00.372 --> 28:02.837
Me especially.

28:02.838 --> 28:06.369
I don't know what it is,
but, uh, you know...

28:06.370 --> 28:08.335
Son of a bitch had it out
for me.

28:08.336 --> 28:09.900
I guess I drove him crazy.

28:09.901 --> 28:12.902
That part I get.
You see me laughing here?

28:16.364 --> 28:19.630
Richie spent a lot of time
as a kid

28:19.631 --> 28:22.362
Figuring out how to keep
this guy off of me.

28:22.363 --> 28:24.927
And he was real good at it.

28:24.928 --> 28:27.029
Till one day
he didn't have to anymore.

28:28.893 --> 28:31.058
The old man fell asleep
on the couch

28:31.059 --> 28:33.823
With a frigging lit cigarette
in his hand.

28:33.824 --> 28:37.722
Fire burned down
the whole house, you know?

28:37.723 --> 28:39.755
I was asleep in my room.

28:39.756 --> 28:41.922
Smoke got to me.
I was out.

28:43.953 --> 28:45.887
Richie came in.
He pulled me out, okay?

28:49.917 --> 28:53.815
I mean, why do you think
I got this stupid thing?

28:53.816 --> 28:56.347
You told me you got drunk
in new orleans.

28:56.348 --> 28:58.813
Well, I did get drunk
in new orleans, but...

28:58.814 --> 29:01.345
Richie told me never
to talk about it, so...

29:01.346 --> 29:04.681
Richie saved your life.
Now you need to save his.

29:06.377 --> 29:07.976
What if he can't be saved?

29:07.977 --> 29:11.874
I just got to get him to el rey,
and he's gonna be fine.

29:11.875 --> 29:15.406
My neighbor patty, right...
Yeah.

29:15.407 --> 29:18.704
She's an r.N. In a mental
hospital over in devore.

29:18.705 --> 29:21.371
Well, I had her over for dinner
one night

29:21.372 --> 29:25.302
When I could finally get richie
out of his shack in the woods.

29:25.303 --> 29:28.967
She gave him a once-over.

29:28.968 --> 29:33.032
She called it disassociative
something or another.

29:33.033 --> 29:34.864
She thinks he hears voices.

29:34.865 --> 29:36.965
Let me get this straight.
You had him head-shrunk?

29:38.596 --> 29:41.729
Okay.
I'll tell you what.

29:41.730 --> 29:44.760
I'm gonna get up now, get myself
and my brother a burger.

29:44.761 --> 29:48.292
You have a nice life.
Seth...

29:48.293 --> 29:49.859
He's not crazy.

29:55.257 --> 29:57.023
She was transformed
by the serpent god.

29:57.024 --> 29:58.655
Who was?

29:58.656 --> 30:00.721
The mistress.

30:00.722 --> 30:03.719
Look, if one or both
of these brothers

30:03.720 --> 30:05.584
Is out there killing
for these people,

30:05.585 --> 30:07.317
You got to stop thinking
like a ranger

30:07.318 --> 30:09.252
And start thinking like
one of your own.

30:09.253 --> 30:10.782
One of my own?

30:10.783 --> 30:14.981
Not racially profiling here,
ranger gonzalez.

30:14.982 --> 30:16.948
These are your roots,
are they not?

30:16.949 --> 30:18.679
I'm from san anton'.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.912
Oh, so you know about
the blood cult...

30:20.913 --> 30:23.344
The one that asks its faithful

30:23.345 --> 30:27.880
To eat the body and drink
the blood of its savior.

30:29.308 --> 30:31.673
Oh, I got my wires
crossed there.

30:31.674 --> 30:32.873
What's your point?

30:32.874 --> 30:34.774
Are you a man of faith?

30:37.839 --> 30:42.669
Gonna baptize my daughter,
same as I was.

30:42.670 --> 30:45.368
This is not just a cartel.

30:45.369 --> 30:47.001
This is a blood cult.

30:47.002 --> 30:49.800
And the patron saint,

30:49.801 --> 30:51.966
To put it in terms
you can understand...

30:51.967 --> 30:57.296
She's a very,
very powerful demigoddess.

30:57.297 --> 30:59.962
Okay.

30:59.963 --> 31:01.860
So, who is she?

31:01.861 --> 31:04.793
Well, nobody knows
her real name.

31:04.794 --> 31:07.359
Just that she was so beautiful,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.327
The serpent god
had to have her.

31:10.692 --> 31:12.558
He sent his faithful out
to collect her

31:12.559 --> 31:16.292
And bring her back to
sacred ground and sacrifice her.

31:18.222 --> 31:19.888
They threw her
into a pit of snakes.

31:19.889 --> 31:22.652
She was consumed
and transformed

31:22.653 --> 31:24.818
And became a mistress
of the night,

31:24.819 --> 31:27.950
A harbinger of the next realm.

31:27.951 --> 31:29.350
Okay. So, what does that
even mean?

31:29.351 --> 31:32.648
It means
the killer who uses this...

31:32.649 --> 31:34.716
He isn't looking for blood.

31:35.846 --> 31:38.848
But trying to see something.

31:40.946 --> 31:44.943
Trying to see something
that people like you and me...

31:44.944 --> 31:47.541
Can't see.

31:47.542 --> 31:51.611
<i>Look and you will see me now.</i>

31:55.538 --> 31:58.407
<i>Set me free.</i>

32:00.835 --> 32:03.834
<i>Come to me.</i>

32:03.835 --> 32:06.269
<i>Richie.</i>

32:07.799 --> 32:09.967
He's trying to see
the other side.

32:23.526 --> 32:26.192
Just tell me.

32:26.193 --> 32:27.824
Just tell me, how do you know?

32:27.825 --> 32:30.526
How did you know my name?!

32:31.924 --> 32:33.788
Gordita.

32:33.789 --> 32:35.755
Only my husband calls me that.

32:35.756 --> 32:37.320
He calls me that during sex!

32:37.321 --> 32:38.854
How could you possibly
know that?!

32:38.855 --> 32:40.921
How did you know?!

32:46.317 --> 32:47.383
You're back.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.415
How's that king kamehameha?

32:49.416 --> 32:50.682
Is that the one
with the pineapple in it?

32:50.683 --> 32:52.314
It most certainly is.

32:52.315 --> 32:55.413
I may be biased,
but I think it's delicious.

32:55.414 --> 32:57.611
Let me get one of those

32:57.612 --> 33:00.644
And two native-style mahalos
with sweet-potato fries, please.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.709
Just the sandwich
or the tidal wave meal?

33:03.710 --> 33:05.675
Tidal wave it.

33:05.676 --> 33:09.207
Oh, uh, you don't, um...
do you have any horchata?
Yes, we do.

33:09.208 --> 33:11.306
It has a little hint
of macadamia nut.

33:11.307 --> 33:12.640
Sounds delicious.
Give me two.

33:14.539 --> 33:17.637
What the fuck?!

33:17.638 --> 33:19.903
Jesus, what are you doing?!

33:19.904 --> 33:21.501
Maybe if I start acting
like a crazy loon,

33:21.502 --> 33:22.635
You'll finally give a shit!

33:23.401 --> 33:25.634
Give me that! Stupid!

33:25.635 --> 33:28.399
It was never gonna be
you and me! It was
always you and richie!

33:28.400 --> 33:29.566
Honey, that's not what...

33:29.567 --> 33:31.631
Don't even try
to sweet-talk me.

33:31.632 --> 33:33.496
You love your brother so much,
why don't you go screw him?

33:33.497 --> 33:35.164
Look, I'm all he's got,
all right?!

33:35.165 --> 33:38.895
Now, why can't you
understand that?!

33:38.896 --> 33:41.596
I'm all he's got!

33:45.292 --> 33:48.323
Look, just...
just go see pritchard.

33:48.324 --> 33:51.622
Get your $4 million, okay?
Just...Go.

33:51.623 --> 33:54.221
We could've been good together!

33:54.222 --> 33:58.424
We were together.
It wasn't good.

36:01.567 --> 36:03.233
I'm not afraid of you!

36:03.234 --> 36:05.132
Stop, please.

36:05.133 --> 36:06.833
Please,
we were just role-playing.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.431
What are you talking about?

36:08.432 --> 36:11.130
My husband and I,
we've been having problems.

36:11.131 --> 36:13.129
We went to see a counselor,

36:13.130 --> 36:15.195
And
she suggested role-playing.

36:15.196 --> 36:19.626
Then we went to a hotel
just... just like this one.

36:19.627 --> 36:22.558
He'd be the cop, and...

36:22.559 --> 36:25.423
I'd be
the high-price call girl.

36:25.424 --> 36:29.089
It cost me
a fortune at frederick's.

36:29.090 --> 36:31.455
It was just something he wanted
to do 'cause it reminded him

36:31.456 --> 36:33.422
Of some burt reynolds movie
that he loves.

36:33.423 --> 36:35.820
I didn't know any of that.

36:35.821 --> 36:38.085
Yes, but you did!
No, it's just noise, okay?!

36:38.086 --> 36:40.319
I hear things inside my head,
and sometimes she talks to me!

36:40.320 --> 36:42.149
Who?!
I don't know!

36:42.150 --> 36:47.353
But if I listen and if I focus,
she can show me things.

36:49.847 --> 36:52.112
I saw you on the bed, okay?

36:52.113 --> 36:54.411
I guess... I guess
you were telling your husband

36:54.412 --> 36:56.111
To call you "gordita."
gordita.

36:56.112 --> 36:58.409
It means chubby, little girl.

36:58.410 --> 37:01.175
Leandro...
he calls me that

37:01.176 --> 37:04.274
'cause he's...
he's always loved my curves.

37:04.275 --> 37:07.405
It was "sharkey's machine."

37:07.406 --> 37:09.272
What?

37:09.273 --> 37:11.271
The movie
that your husband likes

37:11.272 --> 37:13.136
Is called
"sharkey's machine."

37:13.137 --> 37:14.403
He was burt.

37:14.404 --> 37:16.304
You were rachel ward.

37:18.202 --> 37:22.199
I don't know how you did it,
but it's like you saw me.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.532
It's like...
it's like you saw the real me.

37:24.533 --> 37:27.434
I see too much.

37:47.523 --> 37:50.421
Daddy?

37:50.422 --> 37:53.353
Katey-kakes?

37:53.354 --> 37:55.519
We were letting the engine
cool down.

37:55.520 --> 37:57.317
I can help.
Come on.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.217
Oh, this...

37:59.218 --> 38:01.582
this is my little girl.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.082
She's always looking for
the family toolbox...

38:04.083 --> 38:07.217
How you doing?
...Trying to find ways to fix
her old man.

38:09.114 --> 38:12.582
Go on.
I'll catch up.

38:18.475 --> 38:20.408
Well.

38:20.409 --> 38:24.044
Aren't you a little young
to be hanging out in here?

38:27.505 --> 38:30.206
You're a little pistol,
aren't you?

39:04.056 --> 39:05.389
Now, I mapped out

39:05.390 --> 39:07.156
Where all the killings happened
along the border.

39:07.157 --> 39:09.556
Maybe they'll show us...

39:11.253 --> 39:12.452
Huh?

39:12.453 --> 39:14.386
Where's the knife?

39:14.387 --> 39:16.318
What?
Did you take it?

39:16.319 --> 39:18.484
What?
The knife.

39:18.485 --> 39:22.181
Yeah, you, uh...
you wanted me to take it.

39:22.182 --> 39:25.280
You wanted me to put it
in my bag

39:25.281 --> 39:29.046
And take it to the university
for some laboratory tests.

39:29.047 --> 39:31.212
I didn't ask you to do that.
Yeah, you did.

39:31.213 --> 39:33.744
No, I didn't.

39:33.745 --> 39:36.579
Okay.

39:41.273 --> 39:44.006
You're gonna tell me
it belongs in a museum?

39:44.007 --> 39:46.171
Belongs to the lords
of the night.

39:46.172 --> 39:48.039
Is that some other gang
I don't know about?

39:48.040 --> 39:50.336
The nine mayan lords
of the night.

39:50.337 --> 39:52.435
They occupy the first realm.

39:52.436 --> 39:55.134
One of them...

39:55.135 --> 39:57.734
Threw the girl
into the pit of snakes.

39:57.735 --> 40:01.403
If I find those assholes,
I'll arrest them, too.

41:34.492 --> 41:38.662
Baby, not for nothing,
but you best get out of here.

41:46.487 --> 41:49.619
Something is coming.

41:49.620 --> 41:52.484
Night is coming.

41:52.485 --> 41:54.585
Doesn't that come every day?

41:58.482 --> 42:01.284
Today is different.

42:22.471 --> 42:25.004
<i>She wants to be free.</i>

42:25.005 --> 42:27.539
<i>She wants you.</i>

42:50.360 --> 42:51.427
It's time.

43:43.605 --> 43:47.036
Looks like a pattern to me.

43:47.037 --> 43:48.502
It's a safe zone.

43:48.503 --> 43:50.501
That's sacred ground.

43:50.502 --> 43:53.036
That's precisely in the middle
of the cult's ancient lands.

43:55.432 --> 43:59.035
In the middle of that,
the border crossing.

44:00.564 --> 44:02.630
I gotcha.

44:02.631 --> 44:05.395
Hi. My name's lila,

44:05.396 --> 44:07.494
And I just started working
over here

44:07.495 --> 44:09.526
At bethel fidelity insurance
office.

44:09.527 --> 44:14.224
We, uh... we had a little bit
of a computer crash over here.

44:14.225 --> 44:17.323
We got the hearing coming up
on the fuller accident.

44:17.324 --> 44:21.426
That...Should do it.

44:31.385 --> 44:33.350
All right.

44:33.351 --> 44:34.950
See you around.

44:37.015 --> 44:40.280
You have the report
on file, right?

44:40.281 --> 44:42.915
Well, if you could send that
over, that would be just great.

44:48.410 --> 44:50.409
Dad, stop!

44:50.410 --> 44:54.207
Dad, what the hell?!

44:54.208 --> 44:55.974
You all right?

44:55.975 --> 44:58.339
Oh, my god! Kate!

44:58.340 --> 45:00.940
Katey, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

45:03.937 --> 45:06.938
Think I'm gonna drive.

45:15.865 --> 45:17.397
Thanks for your help, professor.

45:17.398 --> 45:18.497
I got to get going.

45:18.498 --> 45:20.863
I know you're in a hurry.

45:20.864 --> 45:22.562
But I just realized something.

45:22.563 --> 45:25.861
You said the bank robbers
are brothers, right?
That's right.

45:25.862 --> 45:28.393
You know the one about
the brothers, don't you?

45:28.394 --> 45:31.491
Summoned to the underworld,
the place of fear.

45:31.492 --> 45:33.593
It's in the popol vuh.

45:36.223 --> 45:38.589
The mayan bible.

45:38.590 --> 45:41.554
The brothers journey to the
underworld to trick the gods.

45:41.555 --> 45:44.220
Trick them how?

45:44.221 --> 45:46.988
They beat them
at their own game.

45:50.450 --> 45:54.282
Richard, it has been
a long, hard road.

45:54.283 --> 45:56.581
But our debts are paid.

45:56.582 --> 45:58.381
And we are finally on our way.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.046
Where's the girl?

46:08.976 --> 46:11.444
What the hell is she doing
in here?

46:21.304 --> 46:23.369
What is wrong with you?

46:23.370 --> 46:25.236
I worked it out.

46:25.237 --> 46:27.534
I can see now.

46:27.535 --> 46:30.366
I can see.

46:30.367 --> 46:32.933
Can you?

46:32.934 --> 46:35.431
And what is this?
Because...

46:35.432 --> 46:37.896
This doesn't look like
anything that...

46:37.897 --> 46:39.896
That I've ever seen, richard.

46:39.897 --> 46:41.895
Don't "richard" me.

46:41.896 --> 46:46.426
I'm gonna do a lot worse
if you don't stop right now!

46:46.427 --> 46:48.458
This is not who we are.

46:48.459 --> 46:50.358
This is not who you are.

46:50.359 --> 46:52.357
Say it!

46:52.358 --> 46:54.290
This isn't me.

46:54.291 --> 46:56.422
Say it again.

46:56.423 --> 46:58.555
Say it!

46:58.556 --> 47:01.223
It is me.

47:04.552 --> 47:07.884
Do you realize what I have
been through to get here?

47:07.885 --> 47:09.184
Huh?

47:09.185 --> 47:11.351
Do you?

47:13.149 --> 47:14.581
It's okay.

47:14.582 --> 47:18.380
This is all gonna be a memory
when we get to el rey.

47:18.381 --> 47:20.445
It's gonna be blue agave...

47:20.446 --> 47:23.178
