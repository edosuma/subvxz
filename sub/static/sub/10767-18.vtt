00:04.813 --> 00:06.849
She still ain't show up yet, Carlton?

00:07.013 --> 00:09.083
No, and I've been waiting
over two hours.

00:09.293 --> 00:12.046
Hey, look, man, don't
even be beating yourself up like this.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.171
- Everybody gets stood up once.
- Once a month?

00:16.332 --> 00:18.893
Why did I ever trust
a computer dating service?

00:19.053 --> 00:21.567
Carlton, hey, hey, come on, man.

00:21.733 --> 00:24.201
Look, chances are,
a girl who matches up with you...

00:24.373 --> 00:26.489
...has already taken her own life.

00:27.493 --> 00:29.006
Very funny.

00:29.173 --> 00:33.086
I'll be back in the stockroom
in the dark.

00:34.013 --> 00:36.288
- Carlton.
- No.

00:45.453 --> 00:48.126
I'm looking for Carlton Banks.

00:48.973 --> 00:50.964
Just a second.

00:51.173 --> 00:53.084
Just a second.

00:57.653 --> 01:00.292
What took you so long, girl? Damn.

02:18.813 --> 02:20.041
Okay, so tell me again.

02:20.213 --> 02:24.047
Once the bread is in those little slots,
you just slide the lever down?

02:24.413 --> 02:26.768
Fascinating, isn't it?

02:27.813 --> 02:31.089
- Hilary...
- Not now, I'm learning how to cook.

02:32.813 --> 02:35.202
- Good morning.
- Good morning, madam.

02:35.413 --> 02:39.691
Sweetheart, do you know
what day it is today?

02:40.813 --> 02:44.328
- Of course I do.
- So, what are we gonna do to celebrate?

02:44.493 --> 02:48.042
Same thing we did last year,
only better.

02:49.413 --> 02:52.769
Gee, Uncle Phil, how are you
gonna top last year?

02:53.573 --> 02:55.086
Well...

02:55.293 --> 02:58.922
- Happy Valentine's Day.
- Happy Valentine's Day, sweetheart.

03:02.853 --> 03:06.323
"Valentines fun for you
and your lover...

03:06.493 --> 03:10.122
...come sing at the Peacock
for a 10 dollar cover."

03:10.333 --> 03:13.530
Neat, huh? And I rented
a karaoke machine and everything.

03:14.493 --> 03:16.449
Gosh, for real?

03:16.613 --> 03:18.569
Aunt Viv, can I be excused
from the table?

03:18.733 --> 03:21.201
I'm just too darned excited to eat.

03:24.573 --> 03:28.168
But Mom, Dad, I've reserved special
seats right next to the speakers for you.

03:28.333 --> 03:32.212
Oh, thank you, son, but your father's
got some special plans for us tonight.

03:32.693 --> 03:36.163
You big romantic guy you.

03:37.893 --> 03:41.203
Hilary, can you drive me
and my date to the movies tonight?

03:41.373 --> 03:44.888
Sorry, Ash, but I'm preparing
dinner for my Valentine.

03:47.773 --> 03:50.003
This is going to be a breeze.

03:50.173 --> 03:52.164
Ashley, I'll give you a ride.

03:52.373 --> 03:53.647
Oh, God.

03:53.813 --> 03:56.885
Daddy, please, I don't wanna spoil
your plans for tonight.

03:57.053 --> 04:00.443
- I don't have anything special planned.
- What about our big evening?

04:00.613 --> 04:03.332
Oh, that's much later.

04:03.733 --> 04:07.521
- So who are we dating?
- Daddy, please.

04:07.693 --> 04:09.843
This is not going to help
my reputation.

04:10.053 --> 04:11.850
What's wrong with your reputation?

04:12.053 --> 04:15.170
You are. You gave every date I had
the third degree.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.925
Boys will not even come near me...

04:17.093 --> 04:19.129
...at school without having
a lawyer present.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.124
Yes.

04:26.613 --> 04:27.966
What is wrong with you, girl?

04:28.133 --> 04:32.331
Will, daddy is going to drive me
and my date to the movies tonight.

04:33.253 --> 04:35.164
That doesn't sound
like that's a big deal.

04:35.573 --> 04:38.690
Will, the last time daddy drove me
and my date to the movies...

04:38.853 --> 04:42.163
...he wound up sitting
in the two seats behind us.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.531
Couldn't you just drop us off
and pick us up?

04:45.733 --> 04:48.327
Oh, I'm afraid that's a little bit
of a problem, Ashley.

04:48.493 --> 04:53.567
See, this girl that I'm dating tonight is
kind of like a 6.6 on the Richter scale...

04:53.733 --> 04:56.372
...so I wanna be there,
you know, for all the aftershocks.

04:56.573 --> 04:58.643
You know what I mean?

05:02.613 --> 05:05.844
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
I'm doomed.

05:06.053 --> 05:07.281
Ashley?

05:07.453 --> 05:12.891
I've circled the movies I feel
are appropriate for you and your friend.

05:13.853 --> 05:15.650
<i>Free Willy.</i>

05:16.133 --> 05:17.930
<i>Beethoven 's 2nd?</i>

05:18.133 --> 05:20.931
<i>- The Return of the Care Bears?
- Oh, that was my first choice.</i>

05:21.373 --> 05:23.364
Oh, but if your mother
asks tomorrow...

05:23.533 --> 05:26.001
...I didn't get any extra butter
on my popcorn.

05:26.173 --> 05:28.164
Oh, whoa, hey, hey.

05:28.373 --> 05:31.649
Uncle Phil, check it out.
There's been a slight change of plans.

05:31.853 --> 05:35.289
Ashley is gonna double
with me and my girl.

05:35.493 --> 05:38.849
I'm not gonna have my daughter
involved in one of your wild evenings.

05:39.053 --> 05:41.044
We playing miniature golf.

05:41.253 --> 05:45.326
That'll be cool unless the church group
shut that place down, you know?

05:45.733 --> 05:47.564
- And afterwards?
- Well, I was thinking...

05:47.733 --> 05:49.564
...we'd run some guns to Nicaragua...

05:49.733 --> 05:51.451
...but we'll probably just come home.

05:52.293 --> 05:53.646
All right, Will.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.809
She's in your hands.

05:55.973 --> 06:01.172
But if anything happens to her,
those hands will be without fingers.

06:01.813 --> 06:05.601
Yes, sir. Lose my fingers, sir.

06:08.613 --> 06:12.049
Hi, good evening, everyone, and
welcome to rocking Valentine's Eve.

06:12.253 --> 06:14.528
Now I know, most of you
are wondering two things:

06:14.693 --> 06:16.126
"How does he dress so well?"...

06:16.293 --> 06:18.727
...and " What is this thing
called karaoke anyway?"

06:19.173 --> 06:21.767
Actually, karaoke has two definitions.

06:21.933 --> 06:23.764
Carry, as in carry a tune...

06:23.933 --> 06:28.131
...and oke, as in okey-dokey,
let the good times roll.

06:30.413 --> 06:33.132
I swear, I made that reservation
a week ago.

06:33.293 --> 06:34.806
Philip, why don't you be a man...

06:34.973 --> 06:38.204
...and admit that you forgot
Valentine's Day.

06:38.413 --> 06:40.483
All right. I admit, I just forgot.

06:40.653 --> 06:42.450
How come you don't forget
Thanksgiving?

06:42.933 --> 06:45.652
Why don't you just relax
and try to enjoy your son's party?

06:45.813 --> 06:48.930
Look who just floated in
on cloud nine, Philip and Vivian Banks...

06:49.093 --> 06:52.210
...two people, who, over the years,
never stopped loving each other.

06:52.373 --> 06:55.331
I should know, my room
was just down the hall.

06:56.453 --> 06:57.932
- Let's get out of here.
- Just...

06:58.093 --> 07:01.005
Hey, there, funny Valentines.
How about a love song?

07:26.413 --> 07:28.722
We're here live
at the St. Valentine's Day Open...

07:28.893 --> 07:32.090
...where Samantha Sackin is about
to attempt a very difficult stroke.

07:32.253 --> 07:36.132
Wait a minute, it looks as though
she's getting some help from her caddy.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.328
Will, I thought
you were the announcer.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.649
Hush up, I'm trying
to help you with your form.

07:41.813 --> 07:45.931
- Stop, not in front of your cousin.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.727
- Come on, let's go out to the car.
- Stop.

07:50.533 --> 07:54.572
- They are really sweet together.
- What do you think he's saying to her?

07:54.773 --> 07:58.971
Probably the same thing you were
saying to girls when you were his age.

07:59.133 --> 08:02.887
I doubt it. When I was his age,
I was trying to get the girls to...

08:07.933 --> 08:09.924
No, no.

08:10.093 --> 08:12.607
He's just a little kid and so is Ashley.

08:12.813 --> 08:15.725
Not so little, Will.
She is a beautiful girl.

08:15.893 --> 08:17.884
Didn't you see
what the putter guy did?

08:18.053 --> 08:22.285
- No, what did he do?
- He dropped her ball on purpose.

08:22.853 --> 08:26.687
Now, why would he do that,
unless he was trying to check out her...?

08:31.973 --> 08:35.090
No, look, that is not possible.

08:35.293 --> 08:37.602
Hey, when I was 15, it was possible.

08:37.773 --> 08:40.366
Yeah, but you
was a little freak though.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.889
No, I'm just saying things were
a lot faster in them public high schools.

08:45.053 --> 08:46.611
She goes to Bel-Air Academy.

08:46.813 --> 08:49.088
I went to St. John's Parochial.

08:50.173 --> 08:53.131
You still got that little dress
and them shoes?

08:53.293 --> 08:56.410
Hey, Carl Lewis, put a move on it.

08:56.613 --> 08:59.730
Hey, take it easy, Pops,
you'll be in a hole soon enough.

09:03.813 --> 09:06.486
That's a really nice outfit.

09:08.253 --> 09:12.690
Hey, look, if I make this putt,
you got to promise me that you'll...

09:12.973 --> 09:14.964
Oh, Will.

09:16.453 --> 09:17.886
Bryan.

09:24.373 --> 09:26.648
You know, Geoffrey,
just between you and me...

09:26.813 --> 09:30.010
...I was a little worried
about making a whole dinner myself.

09:30.173 --> 09:32.562
But there's really nothing to it.

09:33.453 --> 09:37.651
Oh, Miss Hilary, could you pass me
that heavy iron skillet over there?

09:39.213 --> 09:41.249
Hello.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.204
How thoughtless of me.

09:52.093 --> 09:55.642
Oh, dear, I better go tend
to Master Nicky.

09:55.813 --> 09:57.690
What? Geoffrey, you can't go now.

09:57.893 --> 10:00.248
- But the baby needs me.
- He needs you?

10:00.453 --> 10:02.523
I'm the one with orthopedist
coming to dinner.

10:02.693 --> 10:05.082
Geoffrey, I demand
that you stay here and cook.

10:05.293 --> 10:06.646
No.

10:06.973 --> 10:09.123
Can you say that to me?

10:09.333 --> 10:13.531
Well, let's try it again.

10:14.333 --> 10:15.891
No.

10:16.453 --> 10:18.683
By George, I've got it.

10:18.893 --> 10:20.451
- No, no.
- Geoffrey.

10:20.613 --> 10:23.127
- Geoffrey, you come back here!
- No, no.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.363
Good God.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.486
I think there's something wrong
with the stove.

11:32.693 --> 11:37.084
Hole in one, yes! My first one ever.

11:42.253 --> 11:44.972
That bird just doodied on your head.

11:45.813 --> 11:48.247
Will, I got a hole in one.

11:48.453 --> 11:51.251
Oh, you'll do better next time, baby.

11:52.693 --> 11:55.412
Hey, hey, hey.
Check it out, listen.

11:55.573 --> 11:58.133
I got a idea.
Hey, how about we switch partners.

11:58.293 --> 12:01.012
You go down there and play with...

12:01.213 --> 12:03.727
- Samantha.
- Thanks a lot, Ashley.

12:03.893 --> 12:06.282
No, thanks, man,
I like playing right here.

12:06.853 --> 12:09.413
Okay, Ashley, you go down
and play with What's-Her-Name.

12:09.613 --> 12:12.047
- Will...
- Oh, you got another hole in one, baby?

12:12.213 --> 12:14.044
You good.

12:15.133 --> 12:19.012
- Gosh, it's getting warm out here.
- Why don't you take your jacket off?

12:23.813 --> 12:26.373
Ashley, hey, check it out...

12:26.533 --> 12:31.766
See... It's some killer bees
coming from Mexico.

12:31.933 --> 12:34.242
And they could strike at any time.

12:34.453 --> 12:37.445
And they love teenage flesh.

12:37.773 --> 12:39.764
Thanks, but I'll risk it.

12:39.973 --> 12:43.329
Just don't worry, man, I ain't gonna let
no bees get to this honey.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.091
Okay, Junior Mac, listen.

12:49.853 --> 12:54.051
<i>I think, it's time we had
a little chat, mano a boyo.</i>

12:54.453 --> 12:55.932
Will, what are you doing?

12:56.133 --> 12:57.452
Yeah, what's the problem?

12:57.653 --> 13:00.884
I think, the problem is something
called a double standard.

13:01.053 --> 13:03.408
Well, wait, wait, hold up, baby,
whose side you on?

13:03.573 --> 13:06.724
I'm on the side that would like
to continue our date.

13:06.933 --> 13:08.605
And we would like to continue ours.

13:08.773 --> 13:10.684
I thought we was all having
a good time.

13:10.893 --> 13:13.805
Don't you give me
that innocent boy routine.

13:13.973 --> 13:16.885
I know that routine...
I invented that routine.

13:17.093 --> 13:20.290
I see right through you,
you little dog.

13:20.493 --> 13:22.324
Oh, shame.

13:22.493 --> 13:24.927
Man, back off me, man.
I just wanna have some fun.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.685
Fun?

13:28.093 --> 13:31.085
Does this look like a place
to have fun?

13:31.253 --> 13:32.481
I don't think so.

13:32.693 --> 13:34.684
Ain't nobody gonna have
no fun up in here.

13:34.853 --> 13:38.926
- Not me, not you, not her...
- And definitely not me.

13:39.093 --> 13:41.004
Goodbye, Will.

13:41.173 --> 13:45.405
Whoa, baby, come back here...
What is her name?

13:48.413 --> 13:50.005
The word was out on your father...

13:50.173 --> 13:52.164
...but who knew
your whole family was crazy?

13:52.333 --> 13:53.607
Bryan, I'm so sorry.

13:54.093 --> 13:57.085
Ashley, if you ever run away
from home, give me a call.

13:58.693 --> 14:01.844
- Bryan, wait...
- Hey, let him go. Let him go, baby.

14:02.053 --> 14:07.127
And good riddance,
you little Filthy McNasty.

14:08.613 --> 14:10.331
Will, how could you do this to me?

14:10.533 --> 14:13.001
To you? Ashley, I'm doing this for you.

14:13.173 --> 14:15.448
When you get older,
you'll understand.

14:16.053 --> 14:19.090
Look, let me make it better.
I'm gonna buy you some ice cream.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.966
No, I don't want anything.
You're worse than daddy.

14:26.253 --> 14:28.926
Nice job, Cupid.

14:35.453 --> 14:37.409
Ashley!

14:42.773 --> 14:45.731
That's what I call
a happy Valentine's Day.

14:51.973 --> 14:54.043
Ashley!

15:01.813 --> 15:04.805
Why does everyone treat me like
I'm some defenseless little girl?

15:04.973 --> 15:06.326
Because you are, Ashley.

15:06.493 --> 15:09.132
I mean, boys is just gonna try
to take advantage of you.

15:09.333 --> 15:12.211
That's my problem.
Not yours or my father's.

15:12.373 --> 15:14.250
And you know what? I can handle it.

15:14.413 --> 15:18.611
Yeah, right, like you can handle some
big old dude trying to be all over you...

15:18.773 --> 15:21.082
...like cheese on a Big Mac.

15:21.573 --> 15:25.452
Will, maybe I like cheese.

15:27.133 --> 15:30.250
How you gonna like something
you ain't never had?

15:30.773 --> 15:33.651
Please tell me you ain't never
had no cheese, Ashley.

15:34.813 --> 15:39.170
No, but if I wanna have sex,
I do not need your approval.

15:39.373 --> 15:42.046
It's cheese, Ashley.

15:44.533 --> 15:46.524
What you all looking at?

15:46.893 --> 15:48.884
Excuse us.

15:50.693 --> 15:52.809
Look at me.

15:53.333 --> 15:56.882
I'm not the 11-year-old I was
when you first moved to Bel-Air.

15:59.253 --> 16:01.323
Do you understand?

16:02.333 --> 16:04.324
Yeah, yeah, I do.

16:04.893 --> 16:07.691
Maybe we need to send you
to an all-girls school, you know.

16:07.853 --> 16:10.447
Just so you keep your head
on your studies.

16:11.373 --> 16:13.284
Ash... Ashley.

16:13.493 --> 16:16.166
Okay, that's twice.
Ashley, Ashley, come back here.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.483
Come... I ain't playing, girl.
Come back here!

16:18.653 --> 16:21.247
And what are you looking at?

16:24.173 --> 16:25.970
Well, can you fix it or not?

16:26.133 --> 16:28.693
Lady, this thing needs
a whole new mess of parts.

16:28.893 --> 16:31.168
I'll have to come back tomorrow.

16:31.333 --> 16:35.451
Tomorrow? Don't you have,
like, a spare stove in your truck?

16:35.653 --> 16:38.121
I took it out when I put in the hot tub.

16:38.333 --> 16:42.121
Listen, you... Duane.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.807
I happen to have an orthopedist
coming to dinner.

16:44.973 --> 16:47.248
It's Valentine's Day.

16:47.493 --> 16:50.053
Or wasn't there a sign
or something in the trailer park?

16:50.213 --> 16:53.330
Listen, you. The stove
has to wait until tomorrow.

16:53.533 --> 16:56.331
But while I'm here,
maybe I can adjust your attitude.

17:00.013 --> 17:03.005
Hello. Oh, hi, Don.

17:03.533 --> 17:05.171
You what?

17:07.252 --> 17:08.652
Yeah, I understand.

17:09.133 --> 17:12.329
Sure. Bye.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.965
Problem?

17:14.173 --> 17:16.003
My date got called
to the emergency room.

17:16.173 --> 17:19.608
Some old lady fractured her hip
and broke her leg in five places.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.412
Do I have the worst luck or what?

17:22.573 --> 17:24.768
You're not the only person
who had things to do.

17:24.933 --> 17:27.685
I was supposed to go out clubbing
with the Maytag repairman.

17:27.853 --> 17:29.605
He don't get out much, you know.

17:30.573 --> 17:34.168
That a smile?
Was that a smile that I just saw?

17:34.333 --> 17:37.370
Oh, it looks really nice on you too.
You know what?

17:37.573 --> 17:39.643
As long as neither of us
are doing anything...

17:39.813 --> 17:41.644
...why don't we not do it together?

17:42.573 --> 17:47.522
Oh, well, that's very sweet,
but how can I put this nicely?

17:47.693 --> 17:49.809
I'm too good for you.

17:53.693 --> 17:56.253
I usually don't say this to a woman,
but you know what?

17:56.413 --> 18:00.884
You're probably right.
Happy Valentine's Day, pretty lady.

18:15.773 --> 18:19.686
Duane? Do you fix microwaves?

18:41.733 --> 18:42.961
Can we go now, please?

18:43.133 --> 18:46.648
No, I don't want this evening
to ever end.

18:46.813 --> 18:49.566
Stop it, Vivian. You don't wanna
be here any more than I do.

18:49.773 --> 18:53.368
You're right, I would rather be
in a romantic, beautiful restaurant...

18:53.533 --> 18:56.730
...having a wonderful
Valentine's Day dinner.

18:56.933 --> 18:58.161
But you didn't remember.

19:18.093 --> 19:20.687
Look, sweetheart,
sweetheart, you know...

19:27.173 --> 19:29.641
Come on, everyone, hum with me.

19:32.853 --> 19:35.890
Sweetheart, I work very hard...

19:36.093 --> 19:38.812
...to provide a good life
for you and my family.

19:38.973 --> 19:44.206
And every night, I hold you in my arms,
I kiss you goodnight.

19:44.733 --> 19:47.725
I don't need a holiday
to tell you that I love you.

19:47.933 --> 19:49.969
I show you all year.

19:50.173 --> 19:52.448
Oh, Philip.

19:55.373 --> 19:57.409
We're going to Paris
on our anniversary.

19:59.093 --> 20:01.812
Philip. Oh, that's next week.

20:01.973 --> 20:03.565
It is?

20:06.013 --> 20:08.402
- Ashley?
- Oh, great.

20:08.893 --> 20:12.522
I just paid a 10 dollar cover to spend
Valentine's Day with my parents.

20:12.693 --> 20:15.844
- Where is Will?
- I don't know and I don't care.

20:16.013 --> 20:17.651
- How did you get here?
- I took a bus.

20:17.813 --> 20:18.962
You what?

20:20.413 --> 20:23.052
- You got a lot of explaining to do.
- So do you, Will.

20:23.213 --> 20:25.522
You let this child
wander the street at night.

20:25.693 --> 20:26.682
I'm not a child.

20:26.853 --> 20:28.730
You were supposed
to watch out for her.

20:28.893 --> 20:31.885
I did. That's why I kicked
that old nasty boyfriend's butt out.

20:32.053 --> 20:33.281
- Daddy...
- Just a minute.

20:33.453 --> 20:36.126
- What did he do to my little girl?
- I'm not a little girl.

20:36.333 --> 20:40.724
Hey, a little less yelling and shouting,
a little more humming and clapping.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.444
- Look, all I know is...
- Where is the girl?

20:44.613 --> 20:46.843
We was at the Putt Putt Golf
and she was necking.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.287
Who was necking?

20:48.453 --> 20:51.570
- All I know, is I'm dating her...
- You know you had a responsibility.

22:19.613 --> 22:22.810
Five, four, three, two.

22:22.973 --> 22:25.362
We're here live
at the St. Valentine's Day Open...

22:25.533 --> 22:28.843
...where Samantha Sackin is about
to attempt a very difficult stroke.

22:29.013 --> 22:32.210
Oh, wait, it looks like
she's getting help from her caddy.

22:32.373 --> 22:35.251
- Hold, please, hold.
- Ti, you can't walk through the shot.

22:35.413 --> 22:37.165
Did I? Oh, my God.

22:37.373 --> 22:39.284
Jeez.

22:39.493 --> 22:43.725
You little Filthy McNasty.
