00:31.150 --> 00:33.910
We can never
comprehend this world.

00:35.470 --> 00:38.230
We can only learn that there
are dangers.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.870
And there are secrets.

00:44.510 --> 00:49.510
Some secrets bring with them
release, redemption.

00:50.750 --> 00:57.830
But others are best buried deep
in the earth, never to be found.

01:02.590 --> 01:08.310
The Lord said, "I have
set before you life and death.

01:10.350 --> 01:13.189
"The choice is our own."

01:13.190 --> 01:16.869
Do we make a bargain with God?

01:16.870 --> 01:19.070
Or do we trade with the Devil?

02:55.550 --> 02:56.910
Feels good to be home, sir.

03:00.230 --> 03:01.630
That's not what I'd call it.

03:04.310 --> 03:05.709
Long live the King!

03:05.710 --> 03:07.110
Good luck to you, my friend.

03:57.910 --> 04:01.709
Emperor Leopold
of Hungary, Archduke of Austria

04:01.710 --> 04:03.630
and leader of the Holy Roman Empire.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.909
I kiss the hand of the victor

04:06.910 --> 04:11.430
and proffer the humble supplication
of my people and my crown.

04:14.310 --> 04:16.790
The King accepts your wishes
with respect.

04:20.550 --> 04:22.190
Welcome to Versailles.

04:25.510 --> 04:30.509
I can't help but ask why you invited
me and not William of Orange.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.430
I thought perhaps you
and I might speak the same language.

04:36.190 --> 04:37.230
Your Majesty.

04:38.830 --> 04:42.789
You should know your sister bore
her last days with great fortitude.

04:42.790 --> 04:45.590
Please accept our condolences
on your wife's passing.

04:47.230 --> 04:48.989
The King is most kind.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.829
I hope he brings such generosity
to the terms of the treaty.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.230
There is so much to discuss.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.549
You've done all of France proud.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.190
You've made me proud, brother.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.109
I see you've been busy.

05:06.110 --> 05:07.189
Indeed.

05:07.190 --> 05:11.150
And...I have a surprise to show you.

05:20.590 --> 05:25.950
I built this palace as a symbol of
imagination and human achievement.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.829
But that wasn't enough.

05:28.830 --> 05:31.389
Every body needs its heart.

05:31.390 --> 05:33.750
Every crown must have its jewel.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.989
Versailles needed a diamond
so bright, you might think it

05:39.990 --> 05:44.069
was forged by the creator
of the sun, the moon and the stars -

05:44.070 --> 05:50.030
a beacon to the world, reflecting
the power and glory of God himself.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.590
The Galerie des Glaces,
now completed.

06:02.510 --> 06:03.550
Voila!

06:15.070 --> 06:16.470
Gloria tua...

06:19.070 --> 06:20.750
..et gloria dedicatur...

06:21.830 --> 06:24.710
..aedificationis Francorum.

06:58.750 --> 06:59.790
Your go.

07:04.870 --> 07:06.350
Come on, hand over the money!

07:47.750 --> 07:50.069
Well, about bloody time!

07:50.070 --> 07:51.230
Guillaume, come here!

07:56.670 --> 07:58.310
I thought you'd never come home.

08:03.550 --> 08:04.590
Hey!

08:05.590 --> 08:06.630
Bastien!

08:08.030 --> 08:10.109
Well, you didn't get any prettier,
did you, eh?

08:10.110 --> 08:11.830
Good to see you in one piece, boss.

08:14.710 --> 08:17.149
So did Jeanne look after you lot
while I was away?

08:17.150 --> 08:19.509
Your sister can crack
the whip, all right!

08:19.510 --> 08:21.109
Only when they're slacking...

08:21.110 --> 08:23.029
..which is most of the time.

08:23.030 --> 08:25.110
So...how was it?

08:27.430 --> 08:31.549
Over. That's all needs said.

08:31.550 --> 08:34.629
Right, so hurry up and
get out of that uniform.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.389
We have got work to do.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.470
Come on, lads! Move it!

08:49.390 --> 08:52.749
The servants must be crisp
and clean as the linen,

08:52.750 --> 08:55.989
the wine perfectly chilled
and the glasses never empty.

08:55.990 --> 08:58.669
And these flowers are flaccid.

08:58.670 --> 09:02.469
I want only the blooms
bursting with vigour.

09:02.470 --> 09:05.149
The King has decreed this event
should represent

09:05.150 --> 09:07.190
the pinnacle of France's success.

09:08.430 --> 09:10.429
I do not wish to disappoint him.

09:10.430 --> 09:11.470
Go.

09:34.310 --> 09:37.870
So...tell me how much you missed me.

09:40.070 --> 09:42.829
I was somewhat preoccupied,
marshalling troops,

09:42.830 --> 09:44.910
defending the Empire
and dodging death.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.270
I have been rather busy myself.

09:52.150 --> 09:55.429
All that cavorting and carousing
must be quite gruelling.

09:55.430 --> 09:58.989
Of course I must hear all about your
derring-do on the field of battle.

09:58.990 --> 10:01.390
But we have a little
surprise for you first.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.349
Say hello to little Philippe.

10:11.350 --> 10:13.350
He just might be a future
king of France.

10:15.190 --> 10:17.909
A fighting tiger, like his father.

10:17.910 --> 10:18.950
Make it stop!

10:20.470 --> 10:22.149
You're not holding him correctly.

10:22.150 --> 10:23.870
You need to support his head.

10:25.470 --> 10:27.149
Oh! He's hungry.

10:27.150 --> 10:29.670
And you're not anatomically
equipped.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.349
You should have seen the birth.

10:34.350 --> 10:35.550
Utter carnage.

10:40.070 --> 10:43.110
So...here we are.

10:44.230 --> 10:45.590
The hero returns.

10:52.670 --> 10:54.949
You have a remarkable
sense of timing, Bontemps.

10:54.950 --> 10:57.349
It's a natural talent, sir.

10:57.350 --> 10:59.749
Your presence is required
immediately.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.029
I've only just got here.

11:01.030 --> 11:02.189
Not you, Your Highness -

11:02.190 --> 11:04.109
the Chevalier de Lorraine.

11:04.110 --> 11:05.910
He must open festivities.

11:08.870 --> 11:11.590
"There is no peace,"
says the Lord, "for the wicked."

11:29.510 --> 11:31.110
How much longer, Uncle?

11:32.870 --> 11:35.389
I can't wait for the festivities!
I want to dance.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.429
Patience, child.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.669
You're representing your country
and your family.

11:40.670 --> 11:43.749
To acquire an eminent husband,
you will remain silent...

11:43.750 --> 11:45.189
..and drink no wine.

11:45.190 --> 11:48.469
I thought that this was
a palace of fun.

11:48.470 --> 11:49.949
For the French, perhaps.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.829
It remains to be seen how
an Austrian is entertained.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.829
I think Louis seems very generous.

11:54.830 --> 11:58.109
Ha! Louis is never what he seems.

11:58.110 --> 12:00.149
He'll find a way to make us pay...

12:00.150 --> 12:01.190
..somehow.

12:07.670 --> 12:08.710
There.

12:14.110 --> 12:17.749
Your destiny is
there for the taking...

12:17.750 --> 12:19.230
..if you choose to seize it.

12:28.510 --> 12:29.950
Your people are waiting.

12:43.510 --> 12:45.790
Who could fail to be impressed,
my King?

12:50.950 --> 12:52.230
It's nice to be home.

12:58.190 --> 13:00.989
So is he sleeping with
the ice queen or not?

13:00.990 --> 13:02.189
Moot point.

13:02.190 --> 13:04.069
They're certainly thick as thieves.

13:04.070 --> 13:06.549
Some women simply aren't
built for sex...

13:06.550 --> 13:07.590
..apparently.

13:13.070 --> 13:15.270
This is a special day for France.

13:16.310 --> 13:20.109
We might be victorious in battle,
but we greet Emperor Leopold

13:20.110 --> 13:23.150
not as an old enemy,
but as a new friend.

13:24.910 --> 13:27.429
I have invited him here
not to debate sanctions,

13:27.430 --> 13:32.109
but to discuss creating a new world
where our empires co-exist,

13:32.110 --> 13:34.989
a partnership that can benefit all.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.789
To that end, we welcome him
to Versailles -

13:37.790 --> 13:39.270
the beating heart of France.

13:43.670 --> 13:46.590
All this glitter - you would not
think this country broke.

13:51.390 --> 13:53.709
This is also a time
to give thanks...

13:53.710 --> 13:55.949
..to God, above all.

13:55.950 --> 13:58.710
Without his hand,
we would not have peace.

13:59.790 --> 14:04.789
And to my brother, whose strength
and valour have given us

14:04.790 --> 14:06.430
this glorious victory.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.830
Enjoy!

14:24.390 --> 14:25.430
Excuse me.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.830
This must be hard for you,
I imagine.

14:36.670 --> 14:38.389
No, I'm fine.

14:38.390 --> 14:40.669
I know how to survive.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.949
We should spend some time together.

14:42.950 --> 14:45.309
We haven't spoken properly in ages.

14:45.310 --> 14:47.829
You're fully occupied, evidently.

14:47.830 --> 14:53.829
It's such a shame. We used to be
so close, but...

14:53.830 --> 14:55.070
..things get in the way.

14:56.910 --> 14:59.190
How is the King these days?

15:03.190 --> 15:05.389
I think he knows himself
better than he used to.

15:05.390 --> 15:08.349
He can be a hard man to satisfy.

15:08.350 --> 15:09.750
We have an understanding.

15:10.830 --> 15:12.310
A deeper connection.

15:14.630 --> 15:17.390
I don't see you by his side
much in public.

15:18.590 --> 15:19.670
I know my place.

15:20.950 --> 15:22.190
I am not the Queen.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.110
Nor am I a harlot who will
sin with impunity.

15:49.550 --> 15:50.989
Your Highness.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.030
Your Majesty.

15:53.150 --> 15:54.790
I was hoping we might meet again.

15:56.350 --> 15:59.270
Unfortunate you had to lose
the war to do so.

16:02.950 --> 16:05.150
You are still beautiful,
Marie-Therese.

16:06.870 --> 16:08.229
I am older.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.429
None of us can escape time.

16:10.430 --> 16:11.869
But as the years pass,

16:11.870 --> 16:16.389
one gains more appreciation
for the finer things in life.

16:16.390 --> 16:21.310
Life here is about seeking pleasure
for everyone else, except the Queen.

16:23.910 --> 16:26.150
I would very much like to
spend time with you.

16:27.430 --> 16:29.070
I don't think that would be wise.

16:40.150 --> 16:41.229
Suzanne?

16:41.230 --> 16:42.270
Yes, Madame?

16:45.190 --> 16:47.429
I didn't wish to startle you.

16:47.430 --> 16:49.069
I just wanted to check.

16:49.070 --> 16:52.189
I heard that you once worked
at the chateau de Villarceaux.

16:52.190 --> 16:56.749
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font> Yes? Well, I was wondering -

16:56.750 --> 16:59.829
do you remember any of the guests
that were staying there?

16:59.830 --> 17:02.110
Madame de Maintenon, for instance?

17:04.030 --> 17:08.829
They say that, to find out what
really happens behind closed doors,

17:08.829 --> 17:10.750
you just have to ask
the chambermaid.

17:33.750 --> 17:36.389
Your victory has given me
great honour.

17:36.390 --> 17:39.789
It's my soldiers
who should be honoured.

17:39.790 --> 17:41.630
Such modesty becomes you, brother.

17:43.110 --> 17:44.510
I have learnt much.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.990
Which is why I want
you by my side in government.

17:51.590 --> 17:53.629
It's entirely against protocol.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.190
The protocol that I dictate.

17:58.990 --> 18:02.069
I'm no longer a child to be
humoured.

18:02.070 --> 18:04.109
And I'm not given to empty gestures.

18:04.110 --> 18:06.070
I would not be
another of your lap dogs.

18:09.070 --> 18:11.830
Besides, Versailles is complete
and the war won.

18:16.590 --> 18:18.710
What more could any man ask for?

18:53.630 --> 18:56.589
You can rest, sire.

18:56.590 --> 18:57.990
Enjoy your success.

19:01.110 --> 19:02.550
But I'm not finished yet.

19:03.830 --> 19:04.870
Sire?

19:09.990 --> 19:11.230
Call the council.

19:13.030 --> 19:15.190
They will assemble early,
as expected.

19:16.830 --> 19:17.870
Now!

19:33.590 --> 19:38.229
It is time to write the next
chapter of our glorious empire.

19:38.230 --> 19:40.750
To stand still is to die,
so we cannot wait.

19:41.790 --> 19:45.869
Sit! We must seize the moment
before us to embrace our destiny

19:45.870 --> 19:47.870
and to create our future.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.669
Our new priorities must be twofold -

19:52.670 --> 19:55.749
to protect our state
from the foreign foe,

19:55.750 --> 20:00.189
and to consolidate our overseas
territories in tandem.

20:00.190 --> 20:04.589
To that end, I will enlist Vauban
to make our borders unimpeachable

20:04.590 --> 20:09.949
and de Villiers to construct
a valiant fleet for the Americas.

20:09.950 --> 20:12.069
An admirable ambition, sire.

20:12.070 --> 20:15.109
And one we could achieve
if you were to extract

20:15.110 --> 20:17.709
costs from Emperor Leopold
as condition of the treaty.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.990
War is about territory, not money.

20:21.070 --> 20:23.349
But our resources are
depleted, sire.

20:23.350 --> 20:25.509
That's what tax is for, is it not?

20:25.510 --> 20:29.069
This will benefit all of France,
so everyone must pay for it.

20:29.070 --> 20:30.989
The people will not like it, sire.

20:30.990 --> 20:33.269
My role is not to please the people.

20:33.270 --> 20:35.870
Many are struggling to pay
the tolls already, sire.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.790
Paris is crippled by hardship
and poverty.

20:42.350 --> 20:45.830
Sickness is rife
and the sewage is a curse in itself.

20:52.470 --> 20:55.790
"And he showed me
a pure river of water of life...

20:57.350 --> 21:02.710
"..clear as crystal,
proceeding from the throne of God."

21:11.990 --> 21:13.030
Sire?

21:17.950 --> 21:20.269
They need clean water, don't they?

21:20.270 --> 21:23.189
Then I shall provide fresh drinking
water to slake their thirst.

21:23.190 --> 21:25.269
And of the darkness in the city,

21:25.270 --> 21:28.349
I shall light
up the streets to keep them safe.

21:28.350 --> 21:31.989
We are creating a new France,
a new world!

21:31.990 --> 21:35.710
How can my people love me
if I am not a benevolent father?

21:48.430 --> 21:49.949
Thanks for coming, Guillaume.

21:49.950 --> 21:52.750
It's not every day the likes of me
gets to come here, sir.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.950
You might find it's overrated.

21:58.950 --> 22:00.989
You must have had quite a party.

22:00.990 --> 22:02.349
We always do.

22:02.350 --> 22:03.709
And you?

22:03.710 --> 22:05.069
Oh, I haven't had the time.

22:05.070 --> 22:08.549
But it feels good to be
back where I belong.

22:08.550 --> 22:10.190
I wish I shared your enthusiasm.

22:12.270 --> 22:15.070
So what did you want to see me
about, Your Highness?

22:17.670 --> 22:20.229
There's someone
I'd like you to meet.

22:21.270 --> 22:24.069
It was an act of extreme bravery.

22:24.070 --> 22:27.749
The battle was over
and the field was awash with blood.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.909
And I was wading through
the broken bodies, alone.

22:30.910 --> 22:33.309
I never felt such relief.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.069
The enemy was playing dead,

22:35.070 --> 22:37.510
and I had walked
into the lion's maw.

22:38.510 --> 22:39.709
Good God!

22:39.710 --> 22:41.869
They were behind our lines,
they knew they would die,

22:41.870 --> 22:43.829
so they attacked like men possessed.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.790
I killed two, but the third
had struck me down hard.

22:49.270 --> 22:54.229
And then this fearless soldier came
from nowhere and cut them down,

22:54.230 --> 22:55.669
one after the other,

22:55.670 --> 22:58.909
as if it was the sole reason God
had put him on this earth!

22:58.910 --> 23:02.470
He risked his life,
simply to save mine!

23:04.550 --> 23:07.549
You, Guillaume,
are the true heart of France.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.270
How can we ever repay you?

23:11.830 --> 23:14.509
I have no need of payment, sire.

23:14.510 --> 23:17.229
Integrity as well as bravery.

23:17.230 --> 23:18.270
What is your trade?

23:20.950 --> 23:22.229
I'm just a tanner, sire.

23:22.230 --> 23:23.389
I make shoes -

23:23.390 --> 23:24.829
my sister and I.

23:24.830 --> 23:27.269
And how fares your business?

23:27.270 --> 23:31.349
All trades struggle to make ends
meet nowadays, sire.

23:31.350 --> 23:33.349
Then that will be your reward -

23:33.350 --> 23:36.110
you shall be exclusive
purveyor to Versailles.

23:39.110 --> 23:40.870
Does that meet with your approval?

23:44.830 --> 23:45.870
Good.

23:57.870 --> 24:01.989
I'm in heaven on earth!
I wish I could live here forever.

24:01.990 --> 24:03.870
At this rate, it seems
we might have to.

24:05.070 --> 24:08.429
Who would have thought defeat could
offer so much pleasure?

24:08.430 --> 24:10.669
William of Orange loses once again.

24:10.670 --> 24:13.429
It amazes me how you could fight
alongside the very leader

24:13.430 --> 24:14.909
of the Protestant world.

24:14.910 --> 24:16.909
The craft of war often
entails expediency.

24:16.910 --> 24:18.389
Even with the Pope's blessing,

24:18.390 --> 24:22.349
yours was an unholy alliance
against a true Catholic empire.

24:22.350 --> 24:25.749
Hm. Yet you entertain many
Protestants in your own court.

24:25.750 --> 24:27.350
Loyal subjects - every one.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.269
One can barely
tell them apart.

24:33.270 --> 24:35.149
And you're happy for them
to live amongst you,

24:35.150 --> 24:38.069
yet you're a defender
of the Catholic faith?

24:38.070 --> 24:41.310
Protestant or Catholic, we are
all French here.

24:58.150 --> 25:02.389
We are made, Jeanne! I met the King!

25:02.390 --> 25:04.829
You did what?!
You want to see all the gold!

25:04.830 --> 25:06.869
It's the most beautiful
place in the whole world.

25:06.870 --> 25:08.430
And we are to be a part of it!

25:09.470 --> 25:12.429
No! This can't be right.
This doesn't happen to our sort.

25:12.430 --> 25:13.949
Get some cups.

25:13.950 --> 25:16.269
Hold up, everyone! Hold your work!

25:16.270 --> 25:17.349
Good news,

25:17.350 --> 25:18.989
for all of us.

25:18.990 --> 25:21.829
The King has granted us a contract -

25:21.830 --> 25:25.749
to provide our wares to the
nobles of Versailles.

25:27.470 --> 25:29.469
We'll have to work harder,
of course,

25:29.470 --> 25:32.269
maybe get a bigger place,
more suppliers.

25:32.270 --> 25:34.429
God knows how big this could be.

25:34.430 --> 25:36.750
<font color="yellow">Please, everyone, gather round!
</font><font color="lime">Let's go!</font>

25:40.510 --> 25:41.549
The King!

25:41.550 --> 25:42.829
The King!

25:42.830 --> 25:43.870
Long live the King!

25:57.270 --> 26:00.029
You were always
an expert in tittle-tattle.

26:00.030 --> 26:03.269
You're not interested
in the chitchat from the salon?

26:03.270 --> 26:05.229
You mistake me for a common gossip.

26:05.230 --> 26:08.149
No, merely someone who enjoys
fulsome entertainment.

26:08.150 --> 26:10.149
I take no pleasure
in misfortune of others.

26:10.150 --> 26:14.869
So you don't want to hear about
the King's pious favourite, then?

26:14.870 --> 26:17.470
Apparently,
she has a very shady past indeed.

26:19.950 --> 26:21.469
Nonsense.

26:21.470 --> 26:25.429
Well, I've heard, from a reliable
source, that she spent a long summer

26:25.430 --> 26:28.029
at the chateau de Villarceaux.

26:28.030 --> 26:29.389
And?

26:29.390 --> 26:32.829
Well, she had the express
purpose of gaining favour

26:32.830 --> 26:34.550
and access with the nobility...

26:35.910 --> 26:37.350
..by selling her body.

26:38.390 --> 26:41.910
Poppycock! Her arse is tight enough
to uncork a wine bottle!

26:52.350 --> 26:55.310
How many Protestants do you suppose
we might have at court?

26:57.630 --> 26:58.909
Difficult to say, sire.

26:58.910 --> 27:01.669
In the hundreds, I imagine.

27:01.670 --> 27:04.029
This causes you concern?

27:04.030 --> 27:06.069
Simple curiosity.

27:06.070 --> 27:08.349
It's hard to tell these days.

27:08.350 --> 27:10.190
I didn't realise they were a threat.

27:12.510 --> 27:15.669
Some Huguenots plotted against me
in the Fronde.

27:15.670 --> 27:20.629
Along with Catholic noblemen,
if this old man remembers correctly.

27:20.630 --> 27:24.150
While French Protestants fought with
you against William of Orange.

27:27.510 --> 27:30.269
It's not that I have
anything against them, per se.

27:30.270 --> 27:33.629
His Majesty will
recall his grandfather's wisdom

27:33.630 --> 27:35.269
and magnanimity.

27:35.270 --> 27:37.309
The Edict of Nantes was decreed

27:37.310 --> 27:39.830
to accommodate French
people of all faiths.

27:42.630 --> 27:43.670
You're right.

27:46.270 --> 27:47.310
Magnanimity.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.830
A furrowed brow doesn't suit you,
my dear.

28:09.750 --> 28:10.910
I am vexed, sire.

28:12.390 --> 28:15.789
Some of us were born Protestants
through no fault of our own.

28:15.790 --> 28:18.590
Yes, but then you saw the light.

28:21.710 --> 28:22.910
I see it every day.

28:41.950 --> 28:45.710
Forgive me, sire. I fear
I am not made this way.

28:50.630 --> 28:52.830
Anyone might think you were
toying with me.

28:55.430 --> 28:59.510
But we are forbidden that type of
love as you are married before God.

29:29.470 --> 29:30.749
It's the water

29:30.750 --> 29:33.189
and the street lighting
that are pushing us towards crisis.

29:33.190 --> 29:36.349
The combined costs will take us
at least 30% over

29:36.350 --> 29:37.469
the anticipated budget.

29:37.470 --> 29:40.149
I must urge His Majesty to
reconsider.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.789
I think it's a great idea -

29:41.790 --> 29:44.309
the people of Paris live in squalor.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.669
It's the least we could do for them.

29:46.670 --> 29:49.469
Gentlemen, let me introduce
you to our newest member

29:49.470 --> 29:53.069
of the council,
bringing with him fresh insight...

29:53.070 --> 29:54.110
..and challenge.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.389
Now, where were we?

29:59.390 --> 30:00.829
Deeply in debt, sire.

30:00.830 --> 30:04.269
Then we must increase taxation to
address the shortfall.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.229
I'm providing
employment for thousands.

30:06.230 --> 30:08.469
They will be grateful.

30:08.470 --> 30:09.630
Of course, sire.

30:11.310 --> 30:14.349
If I may draw His Majesty's
attention to a fresh conundrum

30:14.350 --> 30:15.829
in the Americas?

30:15.830 --> 30:18.709
It seems our first settlers
were unsuitable.

30:18.710 --> 30:22.309
Those that survived the voyage were
then confronted with disease

30:22.310 --> 30:24.189
and savage natives.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.149
So we need 400 men of
firm constitution.

30:27.150 --> 30:30.069
They must be strong yet dispensable.

30:30.070 --> 30:31.189
Why not send our troops?

30:31.190 --> 30:32.590
That's hardly fair.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.989
They've risked their lives
and limbs fighting for us.

30:36.990 --> 30:39.510
Quite. But we must dispatch someone.

30:40.750 --> 30:42.750
Why not convicted criminals?

30:43.950 --> 30:46.629
The gaols are overflowing
and cost a fortune.

30:46.630 --> 30:51.230
It would kill two birds rather
deftly, don't you think?

30:53.230 --> 30:54.989
The logic is undeniable.

30:54.990 --> 30:58.629
But the emigrants would have to be
reliable to some degree.

30:58.630 --> 31:03.309
So the Duc d'Orleans should select
the suitable candidates himself,

31:03.310 --> 31:05.750
paying particular
attention to the poisoners.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.030
With pleasure.

31:11.150 --> 31:12.830
I am pleased you accepted my offer.

31:24.870 --> 31:27.869
This can't be true?
Tell me it's a wicked rumour.

31:27.870 --> 31:30.069
My dear Delphine,
you have me at a loss.

31:30.070 --> 31:33.549
Word has it the King is less than
happy with us. It's absurd!

31:33.550 --> 31:35.629
What could he possibly
have against Protestants?

31:35.630 --> 31:37.669
I saw the way he looked at us.

31:37.670 --> 31:41.669
I can assure you, the King is
thinking only of his people.

31:41.670 --> 31:45.150
Yes, but which people?
We're all equal before God.

31:46.350 --> 31:48.589
If you could arrange an audience,
I'd like to remind him

31:48.590 --> 31:50.669
that our faith simply offers
freedom of thought.

31:50.670 --> 31:51.949
There is no need.

31:51.950 --> 31:53.589
The King has no issue with you.

31:53.590 --> 31:57.069
But it's not much to ask, Francoise.
We all know you have the King's ear.

31:57.070 --> 31:59.429
And possibly other parts of him too.

31:59.430 --> 32:02.309
The King
and I have an understanding.

32:02.310 --> 32:04.429
We connect through heart and soul.

32:04.430 --> 32:06.709
You do make life hard for yourself.

32:06.710 --> 32:09.629
One is permitted to have fun
once in a while.

32:09.630 --> 32:12.389
God frowns upon wanton indulgence.

32:12.390 --> 32:15.109
Was that what they said
in the Chateau de Villarceaux?

32:15.110 --> 32:16.150
I'm sorry?

32:20.390 --> 32:21.430
Are you all right?

32:24.470 --> 32:26.430
The heat of debate
has made me flush.

32:28.350 --> 32:30.230
If you will excuse me,
I need some air.

32:36.310 --> 32:39.069
When was the last time you threw
your head back and laughed aloud?

32:39.070 --> 32:42.349
My sister was the one
known for her laughter.

32:42.350 --> 32:46.469
Yes, that was one of the things
I liked about her.

32:46.470 --> 32:48.910
As the years went by,
I heard it less and less.

32:50.110 --> 32:51.630
That's because she hated you.

32:54.110 --> 32:56.629
Isn't that the fate of all
marriages?

32:56.630 --> 32:57.870
I love my husband.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.949
Yet he's a Bourbon.

33:00.950 --> 33:02.909
Even surrounded by all this,

33:02.910 --> 33:05.710
he still doesn't know how to
appreciate true beauty.

33:06.710 --> 33:09.269
Don't take me for a fool, Leopold.

33:09.270 --> 33:10.310
What do you want?

33:14.710 --> 33:17.789
I want to talk to the King,
but he's making me wait.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.789
Can't say I blame him -
I'd do the same.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.230
You want me to persuade him
to see you, is that all?

33:26.910 --> 33:27.950
No.

34:08.310 --> 34:11.188
I asked for all prison records,
Bontemps.

34:11.190 --> 34:13.789
Bring me everything there is.

34:13.790 --> 34:16.909
That would be a veritable
mountain of paperwork.

34:16.909 --> 34:18.829
Then I shall scale it.

34:18.830 --> 34:21.590
A good job is worth doing properly.

34:23.150 --> 34:24.190
Thank you.

34:42.670 --> 34:46.150
Oh, come on, Francoise!
Not every woman is the threat.

34:49.790 --> 34:53.190
What is the point of friendship if
we are not honest with each other?

34:58.790 --> 35:00.749
It is the King.

35:00.750 --> 35:02.629
He treats you only with respect.

35:02.630 --> 35:03.670
Yes.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.990
But he has become...impatient.

35:09.390 --> 35:12.869
How can that be?
You grant his every wish.

35:12.870 --> 35:14.550
Not every wish.

35:17.630 --> 35:19.789
You haven't shared his bed?

35:19.790 --> 35:22.789
No...for fear that
I might lose him.

35:22.790 --> 35:25.229
Well, you will definitely lose him
if you don't!

35:25.230 --> 35:28.269
But that would be
the beginning of the end.

35:28.270 --> 35:31.589
Louis has destroyed every
woman that he has slept with.

35:31.590 --> 35:33.189
Perhaps.

35:33.190 --> 35:36.029
But heart and soul
will only see you so far.

35:36.030 --> 35:37.910
You cannot deny our nature.

35:39.590 --> 35:41.749
Every man has his needs.

35:41.750 --> 35:44.030
And every woman knows how
to satisfy them.

35:45.870 --> 35:48.390
And who knows?
You might actually enjoy it.

36:32.070 --> 36:33.110
Madame?

36:34.630 --> 36:36.990
I believe His Majesty
would like some company.

38:02.710 --> 38:04.350
You have done the King a service.

38:08.590 --> 38:13.390
But you must never return here
and you must never approach him.

38:14.870 --> 38:16.829
Is that understood?

38:16.830 --> 38:19.229
But Madame...I thought
that you wanted me to...

38:19.230 --> 38:21.190
You will never meet his gaze again.

38:23.310 --> 38:24.950
Is that understood?

38:28.550 --> 38:30.110
Yes, Madame.

39:12.470 --> 39:14.710
You missed a splendid
soiree in the salon.

39:23.830 --> 39:24.870
And here we are....

39:28.910 --> 39:29.950
..alone...

39:32.670 --> 39:33.710
..at last.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.190
Are you just going to keep
stating the obvious?

39:43.750 --> 39:45.670
Not when I have a much better idea.

40:09.630 --> 40:10.670
No.

40:12.350 --> 40:13.390
I said no.

40:27.510 --> 40:30.990
So we're...we're going to
take this seriously or not?

40:32.510 --> 40:33.550
I don't know.

40:36.390 --> 40:39.190
Perhaps you're more
interested in shoe-makers now.

40:41.070 --> 40:43.549
Guillaume was just a friend.

40:43.550 --> 40:45.710
So why won't you let me touch you?

40:49.070 --> 40:50.830
You're like a complete stranger!

40:53.350 --> 40:55.829
You're like this every
time you come home.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.270
Got a bug in your britches!

40:58.510 --> 40:59.990
Says the cuckoo in the nest.

41:02.430 --> 41:05.069
It might have escaped your notice,

41:05.070 --> 41:08.389
but things have moved on
since you've been away.

41:08.390 --> 41:10.030
I can't disagree with you there.

41:22.470 --> 41:24.670
So we're wasting our time, then,
aren't we?

41:27.310 --> 41:32.230
Look...I was looking forward
to seeing you.

41:35.270 --> 41:36.310
But then I...

41:40.190 --> 41:41.230
I just...

41:53.230 --> 41:54.750
I'll bid you goodnight, then.

42:31.030 --> 42:32.630
I thought I might find you here.

42:35.910 --> 42:37.630
I was confessing my sins.

42:43.270 --> 42:44.910
His Majesty is content?

42:53.870 --> 42:54.910
He is.

43:20.710 --> 43:23.269
How much longer does the King
wish me to stay as his guest?

43:23.270 --> 43:25.789
Until we become friends.

43:25.790 --> 43:28.230
Only then will we find a way
we can work together.

43:30.270 --> 43:32.269
You have my attention.

43:32.270 --> 43:35.509
You are vulnerable to attack
from the Muslim Ottoman Empire.

43:35.510 --> 43:37.749
I will guarantee my total support.

43:37.750 --> 43:39.950
I'll even send the troops
to defend Vienna.

43:41.150 --> 43:42.869
And in exchange?

43:42.870 --> 43:45.149
You will allow me to
reclaim the territories

43:45.150 --> 43:47.109
of Strasbourg and Luxembourg.

43:47.110 --> 43:50.229
Ha-ha! I knew it couldn't
be that simple.

43:50.230 --> 43:52.429
This is a time for big ideas...

43:52.430 --> 43:54.069
..and brave leaders.

43:54.070 --> 43:55.869
Those territories belong
to the Vatican.

43:55.870 --> 43:57.549
I've been entrusted with them.

43:57.550 --> 43:59.909
Then you should discuss it
with the Pope.

43:59.910 --> 44:02.469
I imagine he would welcome
my Catholic backing

44:02.470 --> 44:03.830
against a Muslim foe.

44:08.350 --> 44:11.030
I'll give your offer
the consideration it deserves.

44:20.390 --> 44:21.430
Too thin.

44:27.830 --> 44:28.870
Too old.

44:31.590 --> 44:32.630
Too...

44:34.350 --> 44:35.390
..shit!

44:38.030 --> 44:39.789
Marquis de Chevret -

44:39.790 --> 44:42.630
poisoned his wife so he could
marry his cousin for money.

44:43.870 --> 44:44.909
Your Lordship,

44:44.910 --> 44:48.629
how would you like to meet the
cannibal savages of the Americas?

44:48.630 --> 44:49.670
Excellent!

44:50.870 --> 44:52.430
Now, the Duc de Sullun.

44:53.390 --> 44:54.430
Hell, no!

44:56.830 --> 44:57.870
Where is he?

44:58.990 --> 45:00.230
He was moved years ago.

45:02.270 --> 45:03.789
Where is he now?

45:03.790 --> 45:05.469
I don't know. I never got near him.

45:05.470 --> 45:07.470
We weren't even
allowed to see his face.

45:11.870 --> 45:14.429
But will he relinquish
Strasbourg and Luxembourg?

45:14.430 --> 45:16.029
He'll have no choice.

45:16.030 --> 45:18.470
We've won the war.
Now to win the peace.

45:19.830 --> 45:23.589
I've made an extensive shortlist of
rogues for export to the Americas.

45:23.590 --> 45:26.949
But there's one prisoner
I cannot pinpoint.

45:26.950 --> 45:28.950
Who is the Duc de Sullun?

45:30.030 --> 45:31.190
I do not know that name.

45:33.550 --> 45:34.590
Nor me, sire.

45:35.750 --> 45:36.949
Well, that's what I thought.

45:36.950 --> 45:38.869
How can there be a duc that
no-one's heard of?

45:38.870 --> 45:41.389
He's a noble.
He must have some significance.

45:41.390 --> 45:45.669
Yet there's no record of his crime,
his family or his sentence.

45:45.670 --> 45:47.269
It's like he doesn't exist.

45:47.270 --> 45:50.110
Find the wretched creature
and send him to the Americas!

45:51.870 --> 45:52.910
I will.

45:54.030 --> 45:56.789
So how fares our city of water
and light?

45:56.790 --> 45:59.789
Well, the engineers are
digging a ring sewer for

45:59.790 --> 46:01.109
the right bank of the Seine.

46:01.110 --> 46:04.069
<font color="cyan">They plan to re-route to the river
Bievre on the left.</font> Good.

46:04.070 --> 46:08.349
But our principle drawback remains
the cash flow, sire.

46:08.350 --> 46:12.069
The collection of taxes is
increasingly fraught.

46:12.070 --> 46:14.230
Then we must find
an efficient solution.

46:20.270 --> 46:22.949
You a carpenter?
Right, that'll do.

46:22.950 --> 46:25.310
The able-bodied shall
report for work.

46:27.070 --> 46:32.389
And for those hungry for work,
the King offers opportunities.

46:32.390 --> 46:38.589
There are sewers to be dug, lanterns
to be raised and taxes to be paid.

46:38.590 --> 46:40.429
Right, you! Over here! Hurry up!

46:40.430 --> 46:42.150
Come on, everyone! Stand in line!

46:44.750 --> 46:45.790
Come on!

46:47.670 --> 46:50.069
There's no justice in this city.

46:50.070 --> 46:51.390
I am justice.

46:53.110 --> 46:54.750
And you will pay your dues.

47:30.070 --> 47:32.629
I thought the prisoner was
unaccounted for. <font color="lime">Not any more.</font>

47:32.630 --> 47:34.789
The real record had
been buried as if

47:34.790 --> 47:37.629
<font color="lime">someone didn't want me to find it.
</font>Is this really wise, Your Highness?

47:37.630 --> 47:40.229
How dull life would be
if we were always so wise.

47:40.230 --> 47:42.189
But this is no ordinary prison.

47:42.190 --> 47:45.589
The Bastille holds the most
dangerous prisoners and madmen.

47:45.590 --> 47:47.229
There's something
underhand going on.

47:47.230 --> 47:49.589
I want to see the Duc
de Sullun for myself.

47:49.590 --> 47:51.709
At least wait until tomorrow.

47:51.710 --> 47:53.550
And bring musketeers!

49:36.870 --> 49:40.310
"God looked down and saw the earth
was without form...

49:41.590 --> 49:42.630
"..and void.

49:44.310 --> 49:47.629
"And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.

49:47.630 --> 49:51.350
"And the spirit of God moved upon
the face of the waters."

49:52.630 --> 49:54.830
You may take off your blindfolds.

50:04.750 --> 50:10.150
"And God said, 'Let there be light.'
And there was light."

51:34.190 --> 51:37.550
How can I thank you,
my Lord and Saviour...

51:40.630 --> 51:42.750
..now I have might over my enemies?

51:43.750 --> 51:46.390
I have the adoration of my people.

51:57.590 --> 52:00.109
I'm alive to your wishes.

52:00.110 --> 52:01.990
I can feel you in my veins.

52:03.030 --> 52:07.349
I pledge my life to
do your will on earth, to show love

52:07.350 --> 52:12.029
and to show mercy, to celebrate the
virtuous and to punish the sinners.

52:12.030 --> 52:15.150
For all your bounty,
I give you thanks.

52:33.190 --> 52:36.349
How could I ever have doubted you?

52:36.350 --> 52:38.709
You have given me
the wealth of King David

52:38.710 --> 52:40.910
and power beyond my greatest
desires.

52:47.870 --> 52:51.430
And there is nothing that can take
that away from me.
