WEBVTT

00:39.406 --> 00:41.772
Hey, wait. I'm in here.
Open the door.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.269
Hey!

01:34.428 --> 01:36.760
And, uh...
One or two N's in "inoculate"?

01:36.930 --> 01:37.988
One.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.360
The man says one.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.431
How do you spell "lightning"?

01:43.604 --> 01:45.196
What report are you filing?

01:45.372 --> 01:46.703
He's not. He's doing a crossword.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.171
It's a word search, thank you.

01:48.342 --> 01:49.969
It helps keep my intellect
razor sharp.

01:50.144 --> 01:53.136
Yeah, well, it's pronounced "lightning."
There's no E, Razor.

01:53.314 --> 01:54.474
- "Lightning."
- "Lightning."

01:54.648 --> 01:56.115
I think it's a silent E.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.477
Never fails.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.950
You guys
give us a four-hour delivery window

02:01.121 --> 02:02.611
and always show up
at the last minute.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.190
You know, when a girl says
that she likes a man in uniform,

02:05.359 --> 02:07.327
I don't think
this is what she had in mind.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.051
Don't push it. I'm so over this.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.662
This is the worst assignment ever.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.459
Come on, Sam. Can't be any worse
than the puppy park.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.831
- G.
- Do tell. What's the puppy park?

02:18.806 --> 02:21.240
Sam had to go undercover
as a dog walker,

02:21.742 --> 02:23.607
only he forgot the baggies.

02:24.244 --> 02:26.712
Five dogs. Big dogs.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.871
- No baggies.
- Oh. Eww.

02:29.049 --> 02:31.847
Poop-scooping aside, going
undercover's the best part of our job.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.486
You get to be somebody you're not.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.849
- For you, an improvement.
- And also you like to lie.

02:36.023 --> 02:39.015
What? No. I thought we were picking
on Sam. And secondly, it's not lying,

02:39.193 --> 02:42.560
it's truth re-imagined
for the higher good.

02:44.231 --> 02:46.256
Houston, we have a problem.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.827
Uh-oh. That can't be good.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.770
Ollie Drewett, 52,
an expert in rocket engine design,

02:55.943 --> 02:58.707
and founder
of Drewett Space Technologies.

02:58.879 --> 03:02.110
He got trapped
in a satellite test chamber.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.409
And it looks like
he didn't pass the test.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.416
Here he is showing off
his latest rocket

03:06.587 --> 03:09.181
with his partner Harlan Holt,
and his daughter Ariel.

03:09.356 --> 03:10.846
She's head of operations.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.686
They're basically
a rocket-for-hire service.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.456
You bring them a payload
and they put it in orbit for a price.

03:18.465 --> 03:20.365
What's up
with the giant Rubik's cube?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.292
That's the satellite being tested.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.462
More specifically, a micro-satellite.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.368
Looks like it'd fit in the overhead.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.203
Miniaturization.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.709
After Reagan deregulated
satellite launches

03:32.880 --> 03:38.079
for the private sector in the 80's,
the industry, well, it took off.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.957
Satellites got smaller and cheaper.

03:46.293 --> 03:50.093
The one in question was designed
and built by an American consortium

03:50.264 --> 03:52.164
for a Turkish
telecommunications company.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.062
As a favor to our NATO ally,
the U.S. Government agreed

03:55.235 --> 03:57.965
to build the satellite
using the latest classified technology.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.066
Ortam Communications pays for it,

04:00.240 --> 04:02.640
but they never get to actually see
what makes it tick.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.005
At least that's the agreement.

04:05.212 --> 04:07.237
Anything useful
on Drewett's cell phone?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.177
It froze and melted.

04:09.349 --> 04:11.749
So it "frelted"?

04:11.919 --> 04:13.750
Spell that.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.254
I managed to hack
into Drewett's IM account.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.685
Five minutes before he entered,

04:18.858 --> 04:22.420
"One last shake and bake."

04:22.596 --> 04:24.655
But it was an unscheduled test.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.357
After the chamber is blast-chilled
to below zero,

04:27.534 --> 04:30.503
it then heats up
to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.799
All the air is sucked out of those vents
and it creates a vacuum.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.999
Like space. And the shake?

04:36.176 --> 04:39.475
The satellite stand is designed
to vibrate at a high speed,

04:39.646 --> 04:41.807
to test if the satellite will hold up
during liftoff.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.950
Which, I'm guessing,
has been postponed.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.141
No, actually.

04:45.319 --> 04:49.016
They're still scheduled to launch
in five hours and 22 minutes.

04:49.189 --> 04:52.681
Which is why the DOD wants us
to make sure

04:52.860 --> 04:55.351
that this was an unfortunate
industrial accident

04:55.529 --> 04:57.963
and not something
which might compromise

04:58.131 --> 05:00.395
the security of our technology.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.138
Amigos, vamoose.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.196
Drive or fly?

05:07.374 --> 05:08.534
To Lancaster?

05:08.709 --> 05:11.473
Wait, no,
tell me that's not a serious question.

05:12.412 --> 05:15.973
Space technology
is a pretty specialized field.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.242
You really need someone
who speaks their language

05:18.418 --> 05:19.476
to get them to open up.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.848
Someone with power
to shut them down wouldn't hurt.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.187
An FAA inspection
wouldn't be out of place,

05:24.358 --> 05:25.689
considering the circumstances.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.190
Yeah, but the question is who?

05:27.361 --> 05:29.488
I mean, there's a lot to learn
and not much time.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.741
Why are you looking at me like that?

05:44.077 --> 05:49.538
Mr. Beale, I think it's time for you
to take a little field trip.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.716
A field trip?

06:23.417 --> 06:26.614
Gentlemen, ma'am. Welcome
to Lancaster Air and Space Port.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.379
Right this way.

06:29.289 --> 06:33.385
See, now that is seriously cool.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.221
They take passengers into space
next year,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.590
if you've got 200K burning a hole
in your pocket.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.732
Does that include the baggage fee?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.800
Wonder if they have jet packs
out here?

06:41.969 --> 06:44.335
Got to talk to Hetty
about getting us some jet packs.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.630
Settle down, space cadet.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.097
You guys here about Ollie?

06:48.275 --> 06:49.765
You knew him?

06:52.646 --> 06:54.409
Yeah, I knew him.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.385
Well, at least we know
the locals are friendly.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.684
Photo ID's, please.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.161
- Thanks.
- That's Harlan Holt,

07:13.367 --> 07:14.959
Drewett's business partner.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.899
We'll start with him. See if you
can find Drewett's daughter.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.936
Kens, she lost her father last night.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.768
A little female bonding
may go a long way.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.000
You got it.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.511
So after about 15 seconds,
hopefully, if the timing is right,

07:29.683 --> 07:31.310
- the satellite will launch.
- Mr. Holt?

07:31.485 --> 07:35.251
- But... Yes?
- Agents Hanna, Callen, NCIS.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.989
I'm sorry,
did we have an appointment?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.923
No. But here we are.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.794
Well, can this wait? These gentlemen
have come a long way

07:44.965 --> 07:47.593
- and we're on a strict schedule.
- Pretty business as usual,

07:47.768 --> 07:49.895
considering your partner
was just killed.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.169
Ollie Drewett's death was a tragedy.

07:56.343 --> 07:59.039
But we have a contract to uphold,
and a small launch window,

07:59.212 --> 08:02.010
which is getting smaller every second
I stand here talking to you.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.449
Look, I'm sorry.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.281
We're all dealing with Ollie's death
and the stress of launching the satellite.

08:12.459 --> 08:16.020
Feel free to look around, and I'll see
you have full access to our facility.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.470
Excuse me.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.235
Excuse me! Who are you?

08:31.445 --> 08:32.707
Special Agent Blye, NCIS.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.471
This is Detective Marty Deeks,
L.A.P.D.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.339
I already spoke to the police.

08:36.515 --> 08:40.645
I'm an L.A.P.D. Liaison,
but this is an NCIS investigation now.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.549
We're very, very sorry
about your father.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.714
Why is NCIS interested in this?

08:44.891 --> 08:46.153
Department of Defense request.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.090
Hmm. Protecting your
classified technology, is that it?

08:49.496 --> 08:51.987
Just trying to safeguard
that it hasn't been compromised.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.826
Well, it hasn't.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.503
Where's the satellite now?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.506
It's at the launch site.
It was mated about two hours ago.

09:00.674 --> 09:01.698
Mated?

09:01.875 --> 09:03.001
Put on top of the rocket.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.474
Ah, yes. Mated.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.210
Who would have done that?

09:08.515 --> 09:10.210
It would have been my father.

09:10.383 --> 09:11.509
But...

09:14.087 --> 09:16.078
Harlan Holt took his place today.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.218
- Your father's business partner.
- Yes.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.791
Any tension between those two?

09:20.994 --> 09:24.555
Only about everything, 24/7.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.425
My father didn't have
a malevolent bone in his body.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.468
Every person that worked here
loved and respected him.

09:30.637 --> 09:33.105
- But not Holt?
- Different story.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.498
How different?

09:35.709 --> 09:38.872
We ran checks on the computer
that controls the test chamber,

09:39.045 --> 09:41.275
to see if there was a fault.
There wasn't.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.939
So you're saying that your father's
death wasn't an accident?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.880
I'm saying someone
had to close the airlock

09:46.052 --> 09:47.485
and then activate the test signals.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.121
You're saying that Harlan Holt...

09:49.289 --> 09:52.156
Murdered my father? Definitely.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.138
Okay, Mehmet Osip and Ali Yilmaz
are here,

10:08.307 --> 10:10.673
representing the Turkish
telecommunications conglomerate

10:10.843 --> 10:13.368
that bought the satellite.
We're running backgrounds.

10:13.545 --> 10:15.604
These are Harlan Holt's
career stops.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.009
Any red flags?

10:17.182 --> 10:20.208
Yeah. Back in the 90's,
Holt started an export company

10:20.386 --> 10:22.479
with a guy
by the name of Curtis Roby.

10:22.654 --> 10:26.681
Not long after, they were cited
for shipping parts and software

10:26.859 --> 10:29.157
on our Military Critical
Technologies List.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.853
Recipients included Libya, Syria,
North Korea.

10:32.031 --> 10:35.159
All national security threats.
So they lost their license.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.360
Holt then left the company
and started a new one with Drewett.

10:38.637 --> 10:39.661
Where's Roby now?

10:39.838 --> 10:42.636
He runs his own space-tech company
at Lancaster.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.709
A direct competitor
to Holt and Drewett's.

10:47.513 --> 10:50.710
So did you finish forensics
on the stress chamber?

10:51.050 --> 10:52.483
Still working.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.551
The data at Drewett's a hard nut.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.483
A lot of their intel
is on a closed system.

10:56.655 --> 10:58.088
No online access.

10:58.290 --> 11:00.349
Which is why they need you
out there.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.084
Yeah, I guess.

11:02.728 --> 11:04.320
Look, you're gonna do great.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.196
Really.

11:11.203 --> 11:13.364
Why was your father alone
during the testing?

11:13.539 --> 11:15.973
Isn't there some sort
of safety protocol?

11:16.141 --> 11:17.665
Built into the chamber program.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.004
If there's a malfunction,
it shuts down automatically.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.511
It didn't
because there was no malfunction.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.115
Who had access to the control system
besides your father?

11:25.751 --> 11:29.585
Me, Holt, some
of our ground systems engineers.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.357
Why do you think Holt did it?

11:32.624 --> 11:35.092
My father was all about vision.

11:35.260 --> 11:37.023
Holt, all about profit.

11:37.429 --> 11:39.294
And our company
was losing money.

11:39.465 --> 11:40.523
Holt wanted to sell.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.463
My father found out he put feelers
out to several companies.

11:43.635 --> 11:45.227
How did your father feel
about selling?

11:45.737 --> 11:48.069
He said, "Over his dead body."

11:52.778 --> 11:54.473
Good. Okay.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.119
Ariel Drewett said Harlan Holt
was trying to sell the company.

12:01.286 --> 12:02.981
Her dad was not on board.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.953
And by "not on board,"
she means that Holt killed him.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.553
You guys find anything?

12:08.727 --> 12:11.093
Nothing solid. Holt's stalling us.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.287
Yeah.

12:12.598 --> 12:14.964
Well, he is just about out of time.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.371
Undercover work

12:22.808 --> 12:24.969
is a matter of confidence.

12:25.511 --> 12:27.001
Right.

12:30.315 --> 12:32.806
Were you ever in a school play,
Mr. Beale?

12:33.152 --> 12:37.680
- Twice, a tree and a horse.
- Ha-ha-ha. Which end?

12:39.992 --> 12:43.189
When you're in your chair,
up in Ops,

12:43.395 --> 12:47.695
you are one of the most confident
people I've ever known.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.834
Can I bring my chair?

12:50.802 --> 12:53.669
A case of nerves is understandable.

12:53.839 --> 12:56.706
You're going into the field
for the first time.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.672
It's not that, it's... It's just...

12:59.144 --> 13:01.169
Out with it. What?

13:02.481 --> 13:03.675
"Black Ops." "Call of Duty."

13:03.849 --> 13:06.044
I've wiped out entire platoons
in an afternoon.

13:06.218 --> 13:07.947
"World of Warcraft,"
God knows how many...

13:08.120 --> 13:09.280
Mr. Beale...

13:12.157 --> 13:13.624
I don't have to bring a gun, do I?

13:15.861 --> 13:18.227
I don't think
I could actually really kill someone.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.830
Heaven forbid.

13:22.534 --> 13:26.129
I have no intention
of making you carry a weapon.

13:28.840 --> 13:30.671
Relax, Mr. Beale.

13:31.376 --> 13:33.810
This isn't rocket science, after all.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.149
Well, actually, in this case,
I guess it is.

13:41.486 --> 13:43.215
You'll do fine.

13:43.589 --> 13:48.652
Nell will be listening in on you
at all times.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.725
At all times?

13:52.097 --> 13:55.828
What if I have to use the restroom?
I have a shy bladder.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.611
Ollie was being stubborn.

14:07.779 --> 14:11.510
What you call not wanting to hand
over his life's dream for a payday?

14:11.683 --> 14:13.548
There wasn't gonna be a dream
or a payday

14:13.719 --> 14:15.619
if he kept running the company
the way he was.

14:17.589 --> 14:20.057
Are they questioning them?

14:20.225 --> 14:21.886
Just taking the tour.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.289
Look, Ollie was an idealist.

14:25.797 --> 14:29.096
All his Right Stuff fantasies weren't
making the overhead, R&D, payroll.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.361
This is a business,
an expensive one.

14:31.536 --> 14:34.562
So you stood to lose your shirt
if he didn't go along with the sale.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.468
What are you implying?

14:36.642 --> 14:37.904
No one's implying anything.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.634
He just asked you a question.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.876
I was in a meeting
when the accident happened.

14:43.148 --> 14:44.445
That's not what he asked you.

14:44.616 --> 14:46.982
With four other people
who can verify that.

14:47.152 --> 14:50.212
- How is that for an answer?
- Sounds more like an alibi to me.

14:55.060 --> 14:56.891
Gary Clay, FAA.

14:57.829 --> 14:59.820
I don't understand
why the FAA would be involved.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.761
The accident occurred
in a testing chamber.

15:01.933 --> 15:04.731
Which raises safety issues
that could affect a flight.

15:04.903 --> 15:10.500
Yeah, I've got a work order here.

15:10.676 --> 15:13.236
It's a pre-flight data audit.

15:13.412 --> 15:14.811
Okay.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.315
I wanna speak to your supervisor.

15:18.483 --> 15:20.747
Fine, but, you know,
if I can't do my job,

15:20.919 --> 15:22.409
I gotta make a phone call,

15:22.587 --> 15:25.021
and the guy I call
makes a phone call,

15:25.190 --> 15:27.556
and the launch is scrubbed, so...

15:29.294 --> 15:30.659
Wait here.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.992
I'll have one of our systems engineers
escort you to the test chamber.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.100
Awesome. Cool.

15:36.568 --> 15:37.592
I mean, great.

15:37.836 --> 15:41.363
Ahem. That would be very helpful,
thank you. Ahem.

15:42.841 --> 15:43.933
She seems nice.

15:46.078 --> 15:49.172
Used to be in business with Roby,
selling things you weren't supposed to.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.374
- To people who weren't to have them.
- Business is expensive.

15:52.584 --> 15:53.608
Your words.

15:53.785 --> 15:56.015
I'm not selling anyone's technology.

15:57.856 --> 16:00.324
We might wanna take a look
at that satellite.

16:00.692 --> 16:04.321
Come back with an army of lawyers,
because we launch in four hours,

16:04.496 --> 16:06.794
if that payload doesn't go up,
it'll ruin this company.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.899
Not what Ollie Drewett
would have wanted.

16:09.301 --> 16:12.361
And that's something Ariel and I
can agree on.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.800
She thinks you killed her father.

16:17.008 --> 16:18.566
Then she's wrong.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.543
The eagle has landed.

16:30.255 --> 16:33.053
Eric, you're going to be great.

16:33.225 --> 16:34.385
I got your back.

16:34.559 --> 16:36.527
- Colin Benson. On a schedule.
- Gary Clay.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.686
Great, everyone's leaving
for the launch site but me.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.493
- Where did you go to school?
- Uh... UC Boulder.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.931
Couldn't make the cut at Caltech,

16:45.570 --> 16:47.936
Undergrad. Got my masters at MIT.

16:48.140 --> 16:51.075
So did I. Professor Gordon Ellis.

16:51.243 --> 16:52.335
What a hard-ass,

16:52.511 --> 16:55.071
- but he sure knew his aerospace.
- Yeah.

16:57.549 --> 16:59.779
You know,
I really didn't need this today.

16:59.951 --> 17:04.684
New fuel feed system has us
generating seven megahertz at liftoff.

17:04.856 --> 17:07.086
Have to completely refigure
the Pogo Effect.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.726
Oh, yeah?

17:08.894 --> 17:11.886
Hang on. Searching "pogo effect."

17:13.064 --> 17:16.295
You do know
what I'm talking about, right?

17:16.468 --> 17:18.527
I'm still searching.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.230
Actually, no.

17:22.741 --> 17:25.733
Because anything over five megahertz,
you shouldn't be launching.

17:26.944 --> 17:27.969
Nicely done.

17:28.947 --> 17:31.415
I'm gonna need access
to your system.

17:41.626 --> 17:43.719
Hey, you can go
to the launch site now.

17:47.265 --> 17:50.723
Eric, got something for you
on Gordon Ellis.

17:50.902 --> 17:52.733
Oh, and by the way?

17:53.705 --> 17:56.572
Gordon Ellis hasn't taught at MIT
for ten years.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.510
And we're in.

18:04.716 --> 18:06.911
I've got the data stream,
and scanning

18:07.085 --> 18:08.950
- for bugs in the software.
- All right, good.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.350
I'm gonna inspect the chamber.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.761
Nell? Nell, we've got a problem.

18:27.739 --> 18:29.866
Nell, you gotta help me.

18:30.442 --> 18:31.466
Help!

18:31.643 --> 18:34.874
- Somebody, help me!
- Oh, my God, Eric.

18:35.046 --> 18:36.104
Problem, Miss Jones?

18:36.281 --> 18:37.509
It's the testing chamber.

18:37.682 --> 18:40.845
Eric's locked inside
and I can't shut it down.

18:43.021 --> 18:45.455
- Somebody, help!
- Callen, we have an emergency.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.532
Nell, emergency shutoff.
What am I looking for?

19:03.708 --> 19:06.700
It's an override button.
It's red, protected by a clear cover.

19:24.294 --> 19:27.058
You're sure Eric is all right,
Mr. Callen?

19:27.231 --> 19:29.426
A little shaken up,
but Sam thinks he's gonna be fine.

19:29.600 --> 19:32.068
Where was Holt
when Eric got trapped?

19:32.436 --> 19:34.267
The launch site, with everyone else.

19:34.438 --> 19:36.269
A very convenient alibi.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.136
Much as I understand your cynicism,
Mr. Callen,

19:39.309 --> 19:43.643
Who set the chamber in motion?

19:43.814 --> 19:45.577
Holt is either working
with someone else

19:45.749 --> 19:47.740
or there's another suspect
we're just not seeing.

19:48.051 --> 19:50.212
Eric wants to stay here
and keep fishing around.

19:50.387 --> 19:52.907
Kensi, Deeks will keep an eye on him.
Sam and I are headed back.

19:53.056 --> 19:54.080
Very good, Mr. Callen.

19:59.129 --> 20:02.098
Try not to get frozen or melted again
until we get back.

20:02.266 --> 20:03.893
It's "frelted."

20:05.736 --> 20:09.399
So, Eric, bad idea?

20:09.573 --> 20:11.063
No.

20:11.842 --> 20:13.742
Not yet.

20:17.447 --> 20:20.814
All right, Eric. I ran a systems check
on the test chamber.

20:20.984 --> 20:22.849
No sign of a software malfunction.

20:23.253 --> 20:26.188
What about Colin Benson?
He was with me right before I went in.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.424
Well, he wasn't back
on his computer yet,

20:28.592 --> 20:30.958
unless he logged in
from another site.

20:31.562 --> 20:34.326
I'm still sweeping the system.
I'll let you know if I find anything.

20:36.266 --> 20:38.826
Sorry you almost got frelted.

20:39.369 --> 20:40.666
I hate that word.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.705
- She said "frelted," didn't she?
- Ugh.

20:45.008 --> 20:47.272
- See, Kensi, it's catching on.
- Yeah.

20:52.850 --> 20:54.681
I heard what happened. Is he okay?

20:54.852 --> 20:56.012
Yeah, he seems to be.

20:56.186 --> 20:59.121
Is it possible for someone
to remotely activate the test chamber?

20:59.289 --> 21:01.382
No, not that I'm aware of.
It's a closed system.

21:01.592 --> 21:03.685
So where were you
15 minutes ago?

21:04.161 --> 21:05.822
I was at the launch site.

21:10.167 --> 21:13.136
Drewett fired a dozen
employees after the last launch.

21:13.303 --> 21:16.795
One of them filed a wrongful
termination suit. Jeff Kinto.

21:16.974 --> 21:18.236
Kinto lives near the spaceport.

21:18.408 --> 21:21.138
He claimed that DST
was violating some safety standards.

21:21.311 --> 21:23.336
Got the FAA involved,
but the suit was settled.

21:24.047 --> 21:26.015
FAA investigation
never came to anything.

21:26.183 --> 21:29.084
FAA, huh? Maybe it's time
the FAA reopens the case

21:29.253 --> 21:30.379
in view of Drewett's death.

21:30.554 --> 21:33.580
Think Eric's up for another assignment
after he almost got killed today?

21:33.757 --> 21:35.418
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

21:35.626 --> 21:36.718
We're talking about Eric.

21:38.128 --> 21:41.996
Intellectual fortitude is just
as important as physical strength.

21:43.533 --> 21:47.993
I'm just saying, in the short time
that I've been working with Mr. Beale...

21:48.171 --> 21:50.571
Oh, now it's Mr. Beale.

21:51.208 --> 21:54.177
He seems much more resilient
than he may appear to be.

21:54.778 --> 21:56.336
Looks can be deceiving,

21:56.513 --> 21:59.710
and since deception is one of the key
aspects of being a good undercover...

21:59.883 --> 22:01.908
Nell, do you have something for us?

22:02.853 --> 22:05.287
Well, I was going
over Holt's phone records.

22:05.455 --> 22:08.686
Seven phone calls to Curtis Roby
in the last two weeks.

22:09.059 --> 22:11.857
Ariel said Holt was putting out feelers
to sell the company.

22:12.029 --> 22:13.963
Roby's probably a potential buyer.

22:14.164 --> 22:17.429
True. Holt and Roby
also worked together ten years ago,

22:17.601 --> 22:20.934
when they were convicted of selling
restricted parts to hostile nations.

22:23.106 --> 22:25.597
I think it's time we talk to Roby.

22:25.776 --> 22:28.244
See if he's got the wrong stuff.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.918
So this guy fancies himself
as an artist?

22:39.323 --> 22:41.382
Not exactly Rodin, is he?

22:41.692 --> 22:43.592
Coming from a guy
who decorates his living room

22:43.760 --> 22:45.250
with a portrait of dogs
playing poker?

22:45.762 --> 22:49.220
That's intentional. I'm fully aware of the
kitsch factor. It's a statement of irony.

22:49.399 --> 22:51.731
Is that what you tell girls you
take back to your place?

22:51.902 --> 22:53.130
Just the art history majors.

22:58.976 --> 23:01.774
Okay, Eric, it's showtime, buddy.

23:03.013 --> 23:04.139
He looks nervous.

23:04.314 --> 23:06.475
Well, you would be too
if you almost got frelted.

23:11.655 --> 23:12.747
Mr. Kinto?

23:15.025 --> 23:18.461
Gary Clay, FAA. I need to talk to you
about Drewett Space Technologies.

23:24.735 --> 23:27.363
- I settled.
- We re-opened the case.

23:27.771 --> 23:29.796
Because of what happened
to Drewett?

23:29.973 --> 23:32.874
You claimed they fired you
without cause.

23:33.043 --> 23:34.305
They did me a favor.

23:35.312 --> 23:37.837
Now I build what's really important.

23:38.782 --> 23:39.874
Art.

23:40.050 --> 23:41.847
Quite a 180
for an aerospace engineer.

23:44.321 --> 23:45.811
Why did they fire you?

23:46.790 --> 23:48.519
They modified a guidance system.

23:48.692 --> 23:50.683
Ran a stationary engine test.

23:50.861 --> 23:53.386
And it didn't turn out so good.

23:53.563 --> 23:55.224
New parts were substandard.

23:55.399 --> 23:56.627
But you ordered them.

23:56.800 --> 24:00.133
Yes. But it was Holt who said he knew
where to get ones for a cheaper price.

24:00.303 --> 24:01.531
And Ariel Drewett approved it.

24:02.139 --> 24:05.267
But when it was discovered,
they put the blame on you.

24:09.579 --> 24:10.637
Getting this, Hetty?

24:11.081 --> 24:12.412
Loud and clear.

24:13.850 --> 24:15.681
Could you elaborate on "uh-oh,".

24:15.852 --> 24:16.876
Miss Jones?

24:17.054 --> 24:19.318
Well, I've been crosschecking
background information

24:19.489 --> 24:21.923
on everyone
associated with this case.

24:22.225 --> 24:24.250
It seems
that one of our Turkish friends

24:24.428 --> 24:27.158
has some glaring discrepancies
in his personal history.

24:28.665 --> 24:32.931
Ali Yilmaz did not attend
Ankara University as his CV suggests.

24:33.103 --> 24:37.199
Everybody lies on their résumé.
Or, at least, that's what Sam told me.

24:38.442 --> 24:43.106
His passport record shows recent
travel to Tunisia, Syria and Libya.

24:43.313 --> 24:45.372
Cell phones brought down
the Egyptian government.

24:45.549 --> 24:47.380
In the wrong hands,
a communication satellite

24:47.551 --> 24:50.577
can crush a revolution
by controlling the airwaves.

24:52.189 --> 24:53.247
I'm just saying.

24:53.423 --> 24:57.382
I think we need to have a chat
with our friend, Mr. Yilmaz.

24:58.061 --> 25:00.359
Drewett Technologies is scheduled
to launch that rocket

25:00.530 --> 25:02.293
in exactly 26 minutes.

25:02.466 --> 25:04.593
They need to delay
until we can confirm

25:04.768 --> 25:07.259
that neither their satellite nor rocket
have been compromised.

25:07.437 --> 25:09.428
Patch me in to Mr. Callen.

25:09.773 --> 25:12.139
We're on it, Hetty.
Roby's gonna have to wait.

25:12.609 --> 25:14.736
This thing go any faster?

25:22.052 --> 25:24.885
Final checks are complete.
All systems are green.

25:25.055 --> 25:28.115
- Resume countdown.
- Resuming countdown.

25:28.291 --> 25:34.719
Seven, six, five, four, three,
two, one.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.765
We have ignition.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.967
And liftoff.

25:41.872 --> 25:44.966
All systems look good.
We are in the green.

25:50.013 --> 25:51.446
Too late.

25:56.987 --> 25:59.478
Ten seconds into flight.

25:59.656 --> 26:01.783
Positive tracking.
Burn rate is steady.

26:12.536 --> 26:15.130
We have vehicle failure.

26:30.186 --> 26:32.484
There's not much left.

26:33.022 --> 26:34.546
Nothing left.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.054
They determine the cause?

26:36.425 --> 26:39.656
Take weeks. Why bother?

26:43.532 --> 26:47.024
All these test mock-ups.

26:47.203 --> 26:50.570
People thought my father kept them
around for his vanity.

26:51.006 --> 26:53.975
He told me they reminded him
of how far we had come,

26:54.176 --> 26:55.871
and how hard we'd worked.

26:57.980 --> 27:01.575
He saw every single one of them
as a sacrifice.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.720
What did you see them as?

27:07.590 --> 27:10.320
Something
that he and I did together.

27:11.894 --> 27:13.020
And now, we'II...

27:15.864 --> 27:17.456
I lost my father too.

27:21.837 --> 27:23.930
He was an amazing man.

27:24.106 --> 27:26.836
Strong. Principled.

27:28.377 --> 27:29.708
And you still miss him?

27:30.613 --> 27:31.705
Every day.

27:36.585 --> 27:41.079
But I found a way to move on.

27:42.224 --> 27:44.692
It's what he would have wanted.

27:46.028 --> 27:48.895
And it's definitely what I needed.

28:03.245 --> 28:06.112
Eric Beale, returning from the field.

28:06.815 --> 28:09.784
Is there a debrief?
Do I write a report?

28:09.952 --> 28:11.886
Not exactly sure
what the protocol is.

28:12.054 --> 28:17.321
You can return your FAA credential
to me, and go back to Ops.

28:17.526 --> 28:18.959
Right.

28:23.132 --> 28:25.066
Mr. Beale?

28:26.135 --> 28:28.569
I'm most appreciative of your efforts.

28:29.338 --> 28:30.896
Really?

28:31.073 --> 28:33.234
You brought us valuable intelligence

28:33.409 --> 28:35.900
at great risk
to your own personal well-being.

28:37.546 --> 28:41.141
That's what I call
solid undercover work.

28:41.617 --> 28:45.314
And without the aid of a weapon.

28:48.957 --> 28:51.687
So, what now?

28:52.061 --> 28:56.998
Now we find out
who sabotaged that launch, and why.

28:57.266 --> 29:01.430
Cell phone records indicate you called
Roby one hour after your partner died.

29:01.603 --> 29:04.163
Our company was devalued,
but we still had assets.

29:04.340 --> 29:07.104
Better to get something than nothing,
which is what we have now.

29:07.276 --> 29:09.267
Drewett found out you bought parts
for the vehicle

29:09.445 --> 29:11.140
that were substandard
and unreliable.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.675
That's not a reason to kill someone.

29:13.849 --> 29:16.283
Besides,
Drewett replaced everything.

29:16.452 --> 29:18.181
Oversaw the installation himself.

29:18.354 --> 29:21.118
One of the Turkish representatives,
Ali Yilmaz, has links

29:21.290 --> 29:24.384
to a half a dozen countries barred
from military trade with the U.S.

29:24.593 --> 29:28.723
You have a history of selling sensitive
technology to bad people, Mr. Holt.

29:28.897 --> 29:32.560
Maybe you let Yilmaz get a look at the
classified technology in that satellite.

29:32.735 --> 29:34.168
And Drewett found out about it.

29:34.336 --> 29:36.236
Now, that's a reason
to kill somebody.

29:39.341 --> 29:41.673
He reminds me of every guy
who looked me in the face,

29:41.844 --> 29:44.005
and said, "I'll call you."

29:44.179 --> 29:45.407
Ladies see through that?

29:46.615 --> 29:48.173
Really?

29:49.017 --> 29:51.918
So Kensi thinks he looks hinky.

29:52.121 --> 29:54.646
Well, looking hinky and being hinky
are two different things.

29:54.823 --> 29:58.156
- You think Ariel is wrong about Holt?
- Maybe.

29:58.327 --> 30:00.767
Holt wasn't near that test
chamber when Eric almost got fried.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.089
Frelted.

30:02.264 --> 30:04.664
Why try to kill Eric?
That doesn't make any sense.

30:04.833 --> 30:05.925
A misdirect.

30:06.935 --> 30:09.369
Putting the focus on a malfunction,
instead of the murder.

30:09.538 --> 30:11.062
Which we know it's not.

30:11.240 --> 30:15.404
Okay, so the operating system
was remotely activated,

30:15.577 --> 30:17.738
which could indicate Holt
has an accomplice.

30:17.913 --> 30:20.177
Or that he doesn't
and we're looking for somebody else.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.184
Whoever locked the chamber
and started the test

30:23.352 --> 30:26.150
had to have Eric go inside
and Drewett too.

30:27.689 --> 30:30.021
- Cameras?
- There's only one.

30:30.192 --> 30:33.184
It feeds
to a closed-in security system.

30:34.029 --> 30:35.360
Unless...

30:41.437 --> 30:42.802
My old desk.

30:42.971 --> 30:45.963
- Just as you left it.
- Heh.

30:46.175 --> 30:47.472
My chair.

30:47.676 --> 30:50.804
Untouched and unswiveled.

30:52.614 --> 30:53.945
Are you okay?

30:54.483 --> 30:57.179
It's just not easy coming back in
after you've been out there.

30:58.420 --> 30:59.887
Yeah. I guess I understand.

31:00.055 --> 31:04.492
I mean, even if you were out there
for only seven hours.

31:04.693 --> 31:06.456
- You must be hooked.
- Yeah.

31:08.764 --> 31:10.322
No.

31:11.567 --> 31:15.970
It was challenging and exhilarating,

31:16.238 --> 31:20.106
- but ultimately...
- Unsatisfying.

31:22.411 --> 31:23.969
Yeah.

31:25.013 --> 31:28.505
Well, we have a ton of data
to go through.

31:28.984 --> 31:30.747
I'm back, Nell.

31:30.919 --> 31:32.910
I'm glad, Eric.

31:33.856 --> 31:36.154
Accessing Drewett's computer.

31:36.325 --> 31:38.589
I got e-mails.

31:38.760 --> 31:41.490
They were hidden in a cloud file.

31:41.663 --> 31:43.255
Hey, this one's recent.

31:43.532 --> 31:46.296
Okay. Holt to Drewett:
"New MEMS are here."

31:46.468 --> 31:49.665
Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems.
It's special chips.

31:49.838 --> 31:51.533
Drewett to Holt, "Great."

31:52.274 --> 31:55.675
- Holt to Drewett...
- "I'm happy to install."

31:55.844 --> 31:57.812
Drewett, "Be my guest."

31:58.247 --> 32:00.715
But Holt told Callen and Sam
that Drewett installed them.

32:00.883 --> 32:03.181
- Well, he must have lied.
- Why?

32:03.352 --> 32:06.287
Because maybe
he never swapped them out.

32:18.767 --> 32:21.565
Camera within a camera. Sneaky.

32:21.770 --> 32:23.135
Just like we did in Kosovo.

32:23.305 --> 32:26.900
Question is, who put it there?

32:29.344 --> 32:30.675
We're missing something.

32:31.179 --> 32:33.545
In my case, a fortune.

32:33.715 --> 32:35.182
But how is that possible?

32:35.350 --> 32:38.478
Because you have no future?
Just saying.

32:38.654 --> 32:41.179
We've analyzed the telemetry data
on all three launches.

32:41.356 --> 32:43.688
The first two were test
launches. They went perfectly.

32:44.026 --> 32:47.757
The third, carrying the satellite,
went kaboom after 15 seconds.

32:47.930 --> 32:50.421
But the graphs and data
on all three are the same.

32:50.599 --> 32:51.759
Which is weird.

32:51.934 --> 32:53.026
What kind of weird?

32:53.201 --> 32:54.998
Well, the first two
didn't carry a payload.

32:55.170 --> 32:59.004
The third carried the satellite.
It's small, but it's heavy.

32:59.174 --> 33:01.039
There would have been
a weight differential.

33:01.209 --> 33:03.040
Which would have skewed
the telemetry data.

33:03.211 --> 33:04.872
Unless,
wasn't carrying a real satellite.

33:05.180 --> 33:08.240
A dummy. Like the mock-ups
that weigh practically nothing.

33:08.417 --> 33:09.782
The rocket failure was a cover.

33:09.952 --> 33:11.886
Final "shake and bake" test
wasn't scheduled.

33:12.054 --> 33:15.455
It was Drewett's idea,
checking things one last time.

33:15.624 --> 33:17.785
The moment he started that test,
he would've found out

33:17.960 --> 33:20.724
- that the satellite had been replaced.
- And there's your motive.

33:21.063 --> 33:23.122
The launch goes ahead,
the rocket explodes,

33:23.332 --> 33:24.458
destroying the evidence.

33:24.733 --> 33:27.031
Someone walks off
with a state-of-the-art satellite

33:27.202 --> 33:29.193
loaded
with classified U.S. Technology.

33:29.371 --> 33:30.531
Seller's market.

33:30.706 --> 33:32.037
It would fit in an overhead.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.153
Stealing a satellite is one thing,
but selling it?

33:49.323 --> 33:51.018
Not easy to get one
through security.

33:51.191 --> 33:54.126
It's not the satellite that's so important,
but what's inside.

33:54.294 --> 33:57.354
The satellite, solar panels,
battery, transponders,

33:57.531 --> 34:00.830
but in here, nanotechnology.

34:01.468 --> 34:04.062
Tiny machines,
smaller than the hair on a flea.

34:04.271 --> 34:06.398
And very classified.

34:06.573 --> 34:08.005
Chop-shop.

34:08.175 --> 34:11.042
Strip it down, mark up the parts.
Hard to trace.

34:11.210 --> 34:12.871
Holt has to be working
with somebody else.

34:13.047 --> 34:14.775
Got an alibi
for when Drewett was killed.

34:15.215 --> 34:17.877
So he gave someone remote access
to the test chamber.

34:18.052 --> 34:20.179
Someone who could have monitored
and activated it

34:20.353 --> 34:21.719
from his computer or smartphone.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.982
Whoever
was watching the micro-camera.

34:24.158 --> 34:25.181
Curtis Roby?

34:25.359 --> 34:29.920
He and Holt do have a history of selling
restricted parts to the wrong people.

34:30.097 --> 34:32.895
Kensi, Deeks, find him.
Check him out.

34:36.670 --> 34:37.898
Curtis Roby?

34:38.871 --> 34:39.998
NCIS.

34:40.940 --> 34:43.000
I know who you are.

34:43.177 --> 34:44.201
How did you find me?

34:44.545 --> 34:46.034
Smartphones.

34:46.213 --> 34:47.737
Law enforcement's friend.

34:48.681 --> 34:50.239
That's an invasion of my privacy.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.442
Maybe you should have answered
when we called you.

34:52.619 --> 34:54.917
Why? I've got nothing to talk about.

34:55.089 --> 34:56.181
Not even Ollie Drewett?

34:59.960 --> 35:02.224
Okay. Let's talk about Harlan Holt.

35:02.396 --> 35:04.830
You and Holt do have a history
of being naughty, don't you?

35:05.199 --> 35:06.564
That was a long time ago.

35:06.733 --> 35:08.428
Holt's calls weren't a long time ago.

35:08.602 --> 35:10.263
Seven calls
in the space of two weeks?

35:10.571 --> 35:13.233
The most recent being an hour
after Drewett died.

35:13.407 --> 35:16.103
He wanted me to buy
into Drewett's company.

35:16.343 --> 35:18.072
That would have been
a sweet payback.

35:18.445 --> 35:19.537
Payback for what?

35:20.481 --> 35:23.939
For not making me a partner
in his company, like he did Holt.

35:24.451 --> 35:26.817
Well, I guess two guys
with a history of illegal sales

35:26.987 --> 35:29.080
wouldn't have looked good
in the company profile.

35:29.256 --> 35:31.952
Drewett wasn't gonna let the deal
go through.

35:32.459 --> 35:34.586
Pretty good reason
to get him out of the way.

35:34.761 --> 35:37.127
I was nowhere near that building
when Drewett was killed.

35:37.297 --> 35:38.389
And I can prove it.

35:38.932 --> 35:40.399
You are a software engineer

35:40.567 --> 35:42.762
who specializes
in remote operating systems.

35:42.936 --> 35:44.130
You didn't have to be there.

35:44.438 --> 35:46.235
You and Holt team up again?

35:46.406 --> 35:47.964
This time, get real naughty?

35:48.142 --> 35:50.076
- You've got it wrong.
- Do we?

35:51.979 --> 35:53.947
I hated Ollie Drewett.

35:54.114 --> 35:55.741
But I did not kill him.

36:04.658 --> 36:07.991
Well, looked you right in the eye
when he said it.

36:08.162 --> 36:09.356
And didn't even blink.

36:09.530 --> 36:12.761
Which leaves us with Mr. Hinky.

36:13.167 --> 36:14.634
Holt.

36:22.509 --> 36:24.943
- Kens, you ready?
- We're in position.

36:25.112 --> 36:26.170
On your mark.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.472
Three, two, one.

36:41.929 --> 36:43.624
Clear.

36:44.298 --> 36:45.856
That's funny.

36:46.233 --> 36:48.463
Didn't really see him
as a country music fan.

36:52.973 --> 36:55.066
Nell, Holt's dead. Where's Yilmaz?

36:55.242 --> 36:56.300
At his motel.

36:56.476 --> 36:58.808
He hasn't been near Holt's place
since the launch.

36:59.379 --> 37:01.847
- And Roby?
- Nothing on Roby's computer

37:02.015 --> 37:03.895
suggests he could've been
monitoring the chamber

37:04.051 --> 37:05.712
or had any remote access
to control it.

37:06.019 --> 37:07.350
This rules out Holt.

37:07.688 --> 37:09.918
Somebody knew
Drewett went into that chamber.

37:10.090 --> 37:12.456
You can't sit around,
watching a camera feed all day.

37:12.726 --> 37:15.661
Drewett's text to Ariel said
he was gonna do one last test.

37:15.829 --> 37:18.024
Maybe someone hacked
into her phone.

37:18.198 --> 37:19.426
They intercept the text,

37:19.600 --> 37:22.899
check the monitor,
see Drewett, activate the system.

37:23.070 --> 37:24.094
Murder by remote.

37:25.606 --> 37:27.039
And we've got our hacker.

37:27.207 --> 37:28.401
Jeff Kinto.

37:29.743 --> 37:31.404
Who better to help Holt
screw the company

37:31.578 --> 37:33.068
than someone
the company screwed over.

37:34.114 --> 37:36.014
Only Kinto decides to kill Holt

37:36.183 --> 37:38.276
and sell the satellite technology
himself.

37:38.485 --> 37:40.043
If he hasn't done so already.

37:40.687 --> 37:41.949
We could be in luck, guys.

37:42.122 --> 37:44.556
Kinto rents a booth
at the Saugus Speedway flea market.

37:44.725 --> 37:46.920
Trading starts at 7 a.m.
Tomorrow morning.

38:08.715 --> 38:11.479
Ten bucks? Really?

38:11.652 --> 38:14.120
- What did you pay for yours?
- Let's go this way.

38:19.893 --> 38:21.622
Eyes on Kinto.

38:21.795 --> 38:23.262
Coming up on his booth now.

38:26.099 --> 38:27.930
They've made contact.

38:28.101 --> 38:30.763
It can't be the sculptures
they're interested in.

38:32.072 --> 38:34.563
More likely what's attached to them.

38:42.849 --> 38:45.283
Hiding the satellite chips
in plain sight.

38:45.452 --> 38:46.646
Now, wait for the exchange.

38:52.125 --> 38:54.650
Kensi, Deeks, take the buyers.

39:18.385 --> 39:21.479
Kensi, Deeks, we've got Kinto.

39:30.530 --> 39:31.963
Everybody down!

39:48.215 --> 39:50.683
Power system, fueled and ready.

39:50.851 --> 39:54.309
Pre-flight checks, complete.
Rotor systems, go.

39:54.488 --> 39:57.184
Structural
and engine post-assembly check, go.

39:57.357 --> 39:59.325
Launch area, cleared and ready.

39:59.493 --> 40:01.427
Vehicle power, on.

40:01.628 --> 40:05.189
Engaging
remote flight control system.

40:05.365 --> 40:06.730
This is gonna be so cool.

40:08.402 --> 40:10.097
Initiate countdown.

40:10.270 --> 40:11.862
Initiating countdown.

40:12.038 --> 40:16.600
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

40:37.431 --> 40:39.797
Just a little something
to show my appreciation

40:39.966 --> 40:42.935
for helping me
through my first, and hopefully last,

40:43.103 --> 40:44.730
undercover assignment.

40:44.905 --> 40:46.202
This is so sweet.

40:46.373 --> 40:49.069
Couldn't have done it without you guys.
Especially you, Sam.

40:49.242 --> 40:50.470
- Me?
- Yeah.

40:50.677 --> 40:52.736
Well, after Callen told me
about how he found you

40:52.913 --> 40:55.973
puking your guts out before you went
on your first undercover assignment,

40:56.183 --> 40:59.243
I figured, I could do this, no sweat.

41:02.756 --> 41:03.916
I had food poisoning.

41:05.292 --> 41:09.285
Think of it as truth
re-imagined for the higher good.

41:09.796 --> 41:11.559
Oh, that's nice.

41:11.731 --> 41:12.789
I almost forgot.

41:12.966 --> 41:16.925
I heard you're going back
on your delivery job tomorrow.

41:17.103 --> 41:19.071
Figured I'd save myself some time.

41:21.708 --> 41:22.732

- Uh... Very.

41:31.918 --> 41:33.852
- It's insured?
- Of course.

41:34.921 --> 41:38.982
That was a very smart decision.
