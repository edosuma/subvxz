place on the coast.

My money, some of the best waves
in California.So you're a surfer?

Yeah, well, you see...
I wasn't the best kid.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.640
Hmm?
There was a sheriff
who lived nearby,

07:03.684 --> 07:06.426

he rolled up on me

07:06.469 --> 07:08.863
doing something
I shouldn't have been doing,

07:08.906 --> 07:10.691

07:10.734 --> 07:12.519
He said,
"Either you're going to jail,

07:12.562 --> 07:15.478

to the beach with my kids."

Well, you ever heard

The pro?
Oh, yeah,
I'm just like him,

07:27.185 --> 07:29.971
except if he was older
and sucked at surfing.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.061
Let me know when you
want to hit the waves.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.758

Knife wound.I know that name.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.565
He's an arms dealer, right?ERIC:
Yeah, big one.

07:58.608 --> 08:00.915
He's been on NCIS's radar
for years,

08:00.958 --> 08:03.047
but never surfaced in America.SAM:
He may have been

08:03.091 --> 08:05.354
taken out by one
of his rival arms dealers.NELL: Exactly.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.747
That's why
we're pulling this case.

08:06.790 --> 08:08.052
So, one of Dotson's

08:08.096 --> 08:09.663
main competitors in the States

08:09.706 --> 08:11.229
is a man named Colby Talbert.

08:11.273 --> 08:13.536
NCIS San Diego has an
open investigation on him.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.972
They want us to make sure

08:15.016 --> 08:16.365
that this has nothing
to do with Talbert.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.019
Got it. Any witnesses?

08:18.062 --> 08:20.108
Well, no one saw it happen,
but his girlfriend,

08:20.151 --> 08:22.284
Karen St. Pierre--
she found the body.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.634
Deputy Director Ochoa
has rerouted Kensi and Deeks

08:24.678 --> 08:26.593

to start questioning her.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.072
A guy like Dotson

08:28.116 --> 08:30.988
would have a well-trained
security team. Where are they?

08:31.032 --> 08:32.642
Well, when L.A. County Sheriffs
arrived,

08:32.686 --> 08:34.426
the only person
on site was Karen.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.342

And she informed them that
the security team up and left

08:37.386 --> 08:38.996

Dotson was dead.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.349
Any surveillance footage?

08:44.393 --> 08:46.656
Uh, no. Cameras are
on a closed system.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.658
They're probably backed up
to a hard drive on property.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.364
Ignoring who?Sam. You said you
were going with them.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.062
Oh, no. No,
you must have misheard.

09:01.105 --> 09:03.325
They haven't invited me
in a while.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.935

09:13.291 --> 09:15.337
That is very, very sweet of you,

09:18.166 --> 09:19.733

09:19.776 --> 09:21.343
But I want to.
I think it's a nice way

09:21.386 --> 09:22.997

you know?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.389
Okay, well, that's
incredibly thoughtful,

09:24.433 --> 09:26.261
and she will love it,
but I'm warning you now--

09:26.304 --> 09:28.306
she's not gonna keep
her opinions to herself

09:28.350 --> 09:31.005
about your dress or about
the employees' clothing,

09:31.048 --> 09:33.311
or about the fancy decor in
the Beverly Hills boutique.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.835
Oh, well, then,
it's a good thing

09:34.878 --> 09:36.097
I'm not going
to a boutique.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.099
I'm not buying
a new dress.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.754
What? Uh, okay, listen, I
know we're not the couple

09:40.797 --> 09:42.103
that's gonna be
driving Porsches

09:42.146 --> 09:44.714
and living in Malibu,
but we do okay, so

09:44.758 --> 09:47.151
there is no way you're getting
a used dress for the wedding.No.

09:47.195 --> 09:49.197
So, whatever the cost...Mm-hmm.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.633
...whatever the designer,
it doesn't matter.

09:50.677 --> 09:52.635
I want you to get the
dress that you want.

09:52.679 --> 09:53.984
I want it to be
your dream dress.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.596
You're giving me permission
to get my dream dress?

09:56.639 --> 09:57.988
That is so sweet of you.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.555
That's not what I meant.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.993
I meant that I want you to
get the dress that you want.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.343
I know, and what I want
is to buy my dress

10:05.387 --> 10:06.649
from Brides
Against Breast Cancer.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.303
I use it, and then
I donate it back,

10:08.346 --> 10:10.000
and another bride gets
to use it on her day.

10:11.132 --> 10:13.351
That's amazing,
and now, somehow,

10:13.395 --> 10:15.179
I feel both dumb
and arrogant.

10:15.223 --> 10:16.877
Well, now you're in
your comfortable place.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.182
Thanks for that.
Yeah.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.532
Let's go talk to Dotson's
girlfriend, shall we?

10:24.667 --> 10:26.103
Thank you.
Okay.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.149
Spotted at least six cameras
on the sides of the house.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.629
Windows are glazed.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.848
I'd say it's probably Level B
or Level C protection.

10:31.892 --> 10:34.198
Gate's the real deal.
It's not just for looks.

10:34.242 --> 10:36.200
Impact resistant,
hydraulic swing arm.

10:36.244 --> 10:38.768
Nell said the house was
rented out three months ago.

10:38.812 --> 10:40.727
Maybe Dotson's people
came in and installed it.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.032
Well, makes sense.

10:42.076 --> 10:44.034
You got a guy like Colby Talbert
gunning for you,

10:44.078 --> 10:45.296
you want the highest level
of security.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.734
ERIC:
Hey, I just walked
the perimeter

10:47.777 --> 10:49.779
to check out the surveillance
cameras, and I found this

10:49.823 --> 10:52.086
hidden in the bushes on PCH.

10:52.129 --> 10:53.783
I had the sheriffs

10:53.827 --> 10:56.264
sign it over to us to check out.What is it

10:56.307 --> 10:59.136
Yeah. It was positioned
to see Dotson's front gate.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.269
Killers put it there.
They were watching.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.836
They knew exactly when
Dotson was arriving.

11:02.879 --> 11:05.186
That might rule out
the security team.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.144
They don't need cameras
to know when Dotson got here.

11:07.188 --> 11:08.363
Well, if it's not
the security team,

11:08.406 --> 11:09.581
then someone was waiting
for him.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.236
More like hunting.
This guy's a professional.

11:12.280 --> 11:13.498
It's looking like
Colby Talbert

11:13.542 --> 11:15.544
didn't want Dotson
setting up shop in L.A.

11:29.863 --> 11:31.168
So, the report said

11:31.212 --> 11:32.866
the last time Karen saw Dotson
was in the bedroom.

11:32.909 --> 11:35.259
Then he went to open a bottle
of wine, she went to change.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.305
She comes back,
she can't find him

11:37.348 --> 11:39.481
till she spots him
floating in the water.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.484
She said he was only gone
two minutes, three at the most.

11:42.527 --> 11:44.094
This killer was fast.

11:44.138 --> 11:46.401
She didn't
hear anything.

11:46.444 --> 11:49.534
Normally, I'd think the
killer was hiding inside.

11:49.578 --> 11:52.015
But the security team
had already swept the place.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.669
ERIC:
Hey, guys, I wasn't able

11:53.713 --> 11:55.845
to determine where that Wi-Fi
camera was transmitting to,

11:55.889 --> 11:57.064
but check this out.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.239
That top row--

11:58.282 --> 12:00.284
that's footage
from the side of the house.

12:00.328 --> 12:01.721
No activity except
for the security guards.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.984
But check this one
in the middle out.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.768
SAM:
Killer hid in the backyard

12:05.812 --> 12:07.727
but didn't enter
from the PCH side of the house.

12:08.989 --> 12:10.817
What was that down there?
Can you zoom in on that?

12:14.559 --> 12:15.256
He swam in.

12:15.299 --> 12:16.692
This guy's good.

12:23.699 --> 12:27.964
SAM: Every mansion on this coast
has security and surveillance.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.793
I'm thinking
he used public beach access.

12:30.837 --> 12:33.361
Wouldn't attract
as much attention.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.798
If he did that,
he'd have to swim...

12:35.842 --> 12:37.495
almost two miles.

12:37.539 --> 12:39.280
So this guy's not just a pro.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.890
He's well trained.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.893
We got to be looking for either
ex or current Special Forces.

12:43.937 --> 12:46.200
Yeah.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.811
Before you saw Rick
in the water,

12:48.855 --> 12:51.161
did you hear or see
anything out of the ordinary?

12:51.205 --> 12:53.555
No. Nothing.

12:53.598 --> 12:56.253
Everything felt
locked up, secure.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.560
I never got the feeling
there was an imminent threat.

12:58.603 --> 13:02.346
Do you have a military or
law enforcement background?

13:02.390 --> 13:05.393
Oh, no. No.
No, I don't.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.004
I guess I've just been
with Rick for too long.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.963
In his line of work,
he's a target.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.573
That makes me
a target by proxy.

13:11.616 --> 13:14.097
You cared for Rick.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.627
Yeah, I loved him.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.544
We've been together
for the past five years.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.459
So you'll help us
find his killer?

13:30.244 --> 13:34.030
Was Rick concerned about threats
from a man named Colby Talbert?

13:34.074 --> 13:36.467
No.

13:36.511 --> 13:37.599
No, they had actually come

13:37.642 --> 13:39.862
to some kind of agreement
last week.

13:39.906 --> 13:43.518
We met Colby and his wife
for dinner on Thursday in Paris.

13:44.301 --> 13:47.565
Anyone else who posed a threat?

13:47.609 --> 13:51.482
Um, when we, uh...
when we arrived at the airport,

13:51.526 --> 13:55.530
his security team sent us
pictures of these three men.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.358
They weren't flagged
as official security risks,

13:57.401 --> 14:00.491
but if I saw any of them,
I was supposed to tell him.

14:00.535 --> 14:01.841
DEEKS:
We're still trying

14:01.884 --> 14:03.625
to locate the security team
for questioning...

14:03.668 --> 14:05.757
Oh, you're not going
to find them.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.630
Rick hired very specific people
to protect him.

14:10.588 --> 14:13.896
Last night was a total failure
for them, and they know it.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.855
They don't want to be found.

14:15.898 --> 14:16.899
KENSI:
Well, thank you

14:16.943 --> 14:19.467
for this information.Hope it helps.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.990
Yup.

14:21.034 --> 14:24.472
Whatever you think
of Rick's profession,

14:24.515 --> 14:26.169
he was a good man to me.

14:32.828 --> 14:33.873
Sam?

14:33.916 --> 14:35.091
There's no street parking

14:35.135 --> 14:36.353
anywhere near Dotson's estate,

14:36.397 --> 14:39.052
but I did find a lot
he may have used.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.358
SAM:
Yeah, I'm still trying to figure
out how I would've done this.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.882
Swam from here
to Dotson's estate.

14:42.925 --> 14:45.145
Copy that.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.933
Excuse me? Special
Agent Callen, NCIS.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.544
Can I talk to you for a second?I've been working here all day.

14:53.588 --> 14:55.285
I got witnesses.Relax. This isn't
about you.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.026
I just want to ask
you about this lot.

14:57.070 --> 14:58.419
Right on.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.725
What's your name?Alan Chen.

15:00.769 --> 15:04.164
Alan, uh, looks like there's no
street parking around here, huh?

15:04.207 --> 15:06.601
No, not for two miles south
and four miles north.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.863
I'm looking for a vehicle

15:07.907 --> 15:09.430
that may have been
parked here last night.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.301
You don't happen to have any
surveillance cameras, do you?

15:11.345 --> 15:14.087
No, nothing like that, uh,
but the lot is manned 24/7,

15:14.130 --> 15:16.089
and we log any cars
that park here.

15:16.132 --> 15:17.960
All right, well,
do you happen to know

15:18.004 --> 15:19.788
what was parked here
about 11:00 last night?

15:19.831 --> 15:21.790
Uh, at 11:00...

15:21.833 --> 15:24.749
there were four vehicles here--
three sedans and a motorcycle.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.795
Can I see that?

15:30.190 --> 15:31.582
Thanks.

15:31.626 --> 15:33.584
Yeah. No problem.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.849
Nell, I'm sending you a list
of four vehicles.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.416
Look into the owners.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.115
NELL:
So,

15:42.158 --> 15:43.594
I've got some info
on the three men

15:43.638 --> 15:44.813
whose photos were
on Karen's phone.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.902
Anyone with a record?One, possibly two.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.514
First up is Zak Ebersol--
assault, grand theft auto,

15:50.558 --> 15:52.516
but no way he killed
Rick Dotson, because last night

15:52.560 --> 15:55.432
he was in a holding cell
in Los Osos on a DUI.

15:55.476 --> 15:57.826
Sounds like a rock-solid
alibi to me.

15:57.869 --> 16:00.350
Mm-hmm. Next photo is
barely even a profile,

16:00.394 --> 16:01.917
so facial rec wasn't
an option here.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.267
But there is a house
in the background

16:04.311 --> 16:05.703
that we've located
in Culver City.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.489
It's being leased
to one Jerry Fuentes.

16:08.532 --> 16:12.232
Drugs, gambling.
Ooh, the list is quite long.

16:12.275 --> 16:14.451
What about the third guy,
did we get an I.D. on him?

16:14.495 --> 16:16.018
No. See, that's the weird part.

16:16.062 --> 16:17.585
We have a full image
of his face,

16:17.628 --> 16:19.195
but no records are coming up.

16:19.239 --> 16:22.503
Hmm. All right, got it.
Keep looking into him.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.505
We'll go to Culver City,
check out Jerry Fuentes.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.507
On it. Will do.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.291
NELL:
Hey, Sam,

16:28.335 --> 16:29.640
I just sent you photos
of the two men

16:29.684 --> 16:30.772
Dotson's girlfriend
was alerted of.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.690
Nell, I think I saw this guy

16:35.733 --> 16:37.126
with the goatee
on the beach earlier.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.258
He's got no records.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.694
Nothing's coming up
on facial rec.

16:39.737 --> 16:40.869
It's like he's been wiped.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.131
A ghost.

16:47.136 --> 16:49.356
Got him.
Moving in.

16:49.399 --> 16:50.618
Sending Callen
your position now.

16:53.534 --> 16:55.492
Federal agent!
Federal agent!

16:57.320 --> 16:58.756
Federal agent.
I need your bike.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.020
Get off the bike.
Get off.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.936
You need a helmet!

17:06.112 --> 17:09.115
♪

17:43.279 --> 17:45.934
Stop the truck. Hands
on the steering wheel.

17:50.634 --> 17:53.115
Special Agent Sam Hanna.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.161
Good to meet you.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.611
CALLEN: Hey, Tom.Hey, good seeing you boys.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.309
Thanks for doing us
that solid

18:13.353 --> 18:14.876
and watching Mosley's son.No worries.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.270
Good times.
I learned a ton, too.

18:17.313 --> 18:19.359
I bet you didn't know
the difference between
Supreme and BAPE.

18:19.402 --> 18:20.838
You'd be surprised.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.102
So, what'd you find out
about this Lance Hamilton guy?

18:23.145 --> 18:25.016
Does his story check out?Yeah, it does.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.627
I don't know
what he's up to now,

18:26.670 --> 18:29.108
but this man was indeed
a MARSOC Marine.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.197
He did some missions with
friends of mine in the Teams.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.634
What was their take on him?

18:33.677 --> 18:35.462
Besides the fact that
he had the unlucky path
to become a Marine?

18:35.505 --> 18:38.073
Yeah, he's a solid dude.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.596
You'd want him next
to you in a bar fight.
Yeah?

18:39.640 --> 18:41.555
What's he good at?He's well-versed
in surveillance,

18:41.598 --> 18:43.644
breaching tactics,
and he's a shooter.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.559
Said he left the Marines,
went to FBI SWAT?

18:45.602 --> 18:48.301
Yeah, took the gig with the FBI
to be stateside.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.259
Hamilton's wife was
sick for years.

18:50.303 --> 18:52.435
She died two years ago.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.612
He didn't take it well.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.267
That's right around the time
that he left FBI SWAT
and went dark.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.400
Any idea who would wipe
his record off the books?

19:00.443 --> 19:02.706
I asked, and no one
in the Teams knew of him

19:02.750 --> 19:05.405
working for the Agency
or the other intel groups.

19:05.448 --> 19:06.884
Got it.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.451
So, is Hamilton
still a good guy?

19:08.495 --> 19:10.018
Well, that's what
we have to find out.

19:10.061 --> 19:10.975
Roger that.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.545
Kens, Deeks, you guys
at Jerry Fuentes's yet?

19:15.589 --> 19:16.938
DEEKS :
Yeah, we just got here.

19:16.981 --> 19:19.027
Last time he was arrested,
he had two

19:19.070 --> 19:21.029
illegal nine-millimeter handguns
in his car.

19:21.072 --> 19:23.510
Got it. Thanks
for the heads-up.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.164
DEEKS:
Fantastic.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.823
Agent Callen,
Lance Hamilton.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.652
Guess I got caught
with my hand in the cookie jar

19:35.696 --> 19:37.524
monitoring your murder
investigation of Dotson.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.047
Who are you working for?Justice.

19:39.090 --> 19:41.005
But with State Department
equities.

19:41.049 --> 19:43.834
Task force?

19:43.878 --> 19:47.011
"Task force" usually
implies multiple people.

19:47.055 --> 19:48.099
This is just me.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.364
Why didn't you tell us
you were in L.A.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.627
working Dotson's murder?Dotson's murder is

19:53.670 --> 19:56.107
part of a larger national case.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.545
I don't inform any agencies
when I arrive in town.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.157
CALLEN: Okay.
So how do you want to play this?

20:02.201 --> 20:05.073
You want our help, or you
want to go our separate ways?

20:05.116 --> 20:06.292
What's upstairs?

20:06.335 --> 20:08.424
Another interrogation room.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.165
Hmm.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.994
This arms dealer
Rick Dotson

20:13.037 --> 20:15.344
is the fourth murder
in the last six months.

20:15.388 --> 20:16.780
The first was

20:16.824 --> 20:18.652
an opioid manufacturer
from Jersey City;

20:18.695 --> 20:20.262
second, a heroin
supplier in Houston;

20:20.306 --> 20:24.092
then a gang leader from Oakland;
then Dotson.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.963
All high-level
criminals,

20:26.007 --> 20:28.139
all killed by someone
with expert skills.

20:28.183 --> 20:30.098
A highly trained vigilante.

20:30.141 --> 20:31.708
That's exactly
why I'm on this case.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.885
Certain people feel as though
we trained him.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.757
Elite special forces.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.454
This is one beautiful canoe.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.586
Did you make this?

20:41.152 --> 20:42.458
Hmm.

20:42.502 --> 20:44.199
I guess I got a little
too close to Dotson

20:44.243 --> 20:45.287
at Van Nuys Airport.

20:45.331 --> 20:46.984
His security team make me?SAM: Yeah.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.421
They had a pic of you.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.901
I didn't have any intel
Dotson was the next target.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.163
But he did match
up with all

20:52.207 --> 20:54.383
the vigilante's past victims.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.124
Guess I guessed right.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.865
I wasn't expecting the killer

20:57.908 --> 21:00.476
to move on Dotson so quickly
and from the water.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.566
You have any idea who you think
the next target might be?

21:05.525 --> 21:08.310
No.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.877
One thing's for sure.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.445
Guy we're hunting?

21:12.488 --> 21:14.229
He's one of us.

21:26.285 --> 21:30.376
Jerry Fuentes, it's NCIS.
We have questions for you.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.510
Dude, I can see you
standing there.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.207
Open up the door slowly.

21:38.732 --> 21:39.907
Jerry?

21:39.950 --> 21:42.083
Jerry! We got a runner.

21:48.437 --> 21:49.395
Oh!

21:49.438 --> 21:50.439
Stay down.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.267
DEEKS:
Oh, Jerry!

21:54.574 --> 21:55.662
That's why you don't run.

21:55.705 --> 21:57.664
Come on. This is
excessive use of force.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.231
You were running from federal
agents. This is not excessive.

22:00.275 --> 22:02.843
We only want to ask you
some questions, buddy.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.584
Ready, Jerry? On three.
One, two, three.

22:04.627 --> 22:08.196
Okay, okay. You're right.
I'll be cool.

22:10.546 --> 22:11.634
Oh! Jerry.

22:11.678 --> 22:13.984
Oh, I think you broke me.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.377
Jerry, it's pretty evident
you're not a fighter.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.031
So let's hope you can
become a professional

22:17.074 --> 22:18.598
question answerer
pretty quick here.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.817
Yeah, okay. Please
just let me lie here, though?

22:20.861 --> 22:22.906
You know a Rick Dotson:
I knew it.

22:22.950 --> 22:26.214
You work for Dotson.You don't give us some
nice, concise answers,

22:26.257 --> 22:28.390
we're gonna be forced to
book you for assaulting
a federal agent.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.436
DEEKS: Actually, it's more
like attempted assault.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.351
Well, technically,
it's an attempted assault

22:32.394 --> 22:34.265
into a perfect setup
for a judo throw, but I think

22:34.309 --> 22:35.876
it's still a felony.Yeah, it was a pretty
good throw, though.

22:35.919 --> 22:37.225
You got a lot of air, Jerry.

22:37.268 --> 22:39.009
KENSI: You want to
go to jail, Jerry?

22:39.053 --> 22:41.098
I brokered a gun deal
for Dotson last year.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.231
And the buyers disappeared
and it fell through.

22:43.274 --> 22:44.798
That it?

22:44.841 --> 22:47.627
Well, not so much.

22:47.670 --> 22:49.237
Jerry.

22:49.280 --> 22:52.240
The buyers stole Dotson's guns
from me.

22:52.283 --> 22:53.633
Dotson wasn't
too happy about that.

22:53.676 --> 22:56.766
Where were you yesterday
around 9:00 p.m.?

22:56.810 --> 22:59.116
With my parole officer
for dinner.

22:59.160 --> 23:00.291
Why do you want
to know where I was?

23:00.335 --> 23:01.902
'Cause Dotson was
murdered last night.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.947
What? Awesome.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.342
Jerry.I mean, R.I.P.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.388
Hey, thoughts and prayers
all the way, bro.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.262
NELL:
Jerry Fuentes's alibi
checks out.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.264
His parole officer corroborated
the whole dinner story.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.745
And I pulled footage from
the restaurant to verify that.

23:18.788 --> 23:22.575
Fuentes was there from 9:00 p.m.
to 11:20 p.m. last night.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.315
NELL: But we're not
back to square one,

23:24.359 --> 23:26.187
at least not yet,
so we have some

23:26.230 --> 23:28.581
new info on the four vehicles
parked at the beach last night.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.409
Three sedans and a motorcycle.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.976
Motorcycle was used in both the
Oakland and the Houston murders.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.978
Well, we may have
located your man.

23:35.022 --> 23:39.374
The motorcycle is a Ninja H2,
registered to a Casey Aguilar.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.985
Ex-husband was a man
named Daniel Aguilar.

23:42.029 --> 23:44.074
ERIC: Aguilar was
an Army Ranger, career soldier,

23:44.118 --> 23:45.685
served with honor
and distinction.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.687
But 20 months ago,
when his service was up,

23:47.730 --> 23:49.906
he didn't reenlist, like he'd
done every other time before.

23:49.950 --> 23:51.560
Aguilar might be our guy.

23:51.604 --> 23:53.214
Daniel Aguilar doesn't have

23:53.257 --> 23:57.305
a local L.A. address,
but he did rent a storage garage

23:57.348 --> 23:59.829
in Westchester about 18 months
ago, after his divorce,

23:59.873 --> 24:02.397
and it's not far from Kensi
and Deeks's current position.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.920
Send Kensi and Deeks
to the garage,

24:03.964 --> 24:05.922
send the location of Aguilar's
ex-wife to our phones.

24:05.966 --> 24:06.793
Yeah. Copy that.

24:14.540 --> 24:16.498
Hi, I'm Casey Aguilar.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.283
Uh, my boss said
you'd like to talk to me?

24:19.327 --> 24:21.285
We're federal agents. We'd like
to ask you a few questions

24:21.329 --> 24:22.635
about your ex-husband, please.

24:22.678 --> 24:23.810
Is Danny okay?

24:25.246 --> 24:26.639
He hasn't done anything wrong,
has he?

24:26.682 --> 24:27.988
We don't know that.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.903
We need to find him
and talk to him.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.078
Have you
seen him lately?

24:31.121 --> 24:33.515
No, no. Uh, he's deployed.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.517
Germany, I think.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.304
Ma'am, he left the service
20 months ago.

24:40.348 --> 24:44.483
He what?

24:44.526 --> 24:45.962
Do the two of you
share the motorcycle

24:46.006 --> 24:47.355
that's registered
under your name?

24:47.398 --> 24:49.139
Motorcycle?

24:49.183 --> 24:51.141
A Kawasaki Ninja.

24:51.185 --> 24:53.274
N-N... I don't have
a motorcycle, no.

24:55.755 --> 24:58.584
We believe he keeps it at his
storage garage in Westchester.

24:58.627 --> 25:03.414
You must think I'm such a fool.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.547
I don't know about
any of this.

25:05.591 --> 25:09.769
Danny is such
a kind and good man.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.335
Whatever you think he's done,

25:11.379 --> 25:13.163
he's given his life
to this country.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.862
He's a hero.

25:15.905 --> 25:17.820
Casey, I'm sorry to ask this,
but it seems that you care...

25:17.864 --> 25:19.779
Yeah, I love him,

25:19.822 --> 25:21.955
with everything.

25:23.652 --> 25:25.262
I love him,

25:25.306 --> 25:28.091
and I know that he loves me.

25:28.135 --> 25:30.093
So, why are we divorced?

25:34.271 --> 25:37.013
23 months ago,

25:37.057 --> 25:40.103
our son William was nine.

25:40.147 --> 25:43.324
He was practicing his guitar
in his room.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.848
:
He was so driven,

25:45.892 --> 25:47.894
so talented.

25:47.937 --> 25:52.376
He practiced every day
for hours.

25:52.420 --> 25:56.859
It sounded like fireworks.

25:56.903 --> 26:02.386
I just thought it was kids with
leftover Fourth of July stuff.

26:02.430 --> 26:05.433
Then I heard the window break.

26:05.476 --> 26:08.392
And William,

26:08.436 --> 26:12.092
his scream.

26:12.135 --> 26:15.748
He never let go of the guitar.

26:20.448 --> 26:24.757
The kid next door
was dealing drugs.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.107
I, uh... it was
a drive-by shooting.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.372
I'm so sorry.

26:31.415 --> 26:36.333
William would have
turned 11 next month.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.734
Danny was so
close to him.

26:45.778 --> 26:47.736
He wasn't the same
after William's passing.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.651
He was a different man.

26:49.695 --> 26:51.827
He couldn't even
be around me anymore.

26:51.871 --> 26:55.265
S-So, when you find Danny...

26:55.309 --> 26:58.007
Please don't hurt him.

27:05.536 --> 27:08.496
Hey, Kens, the search warrant
for Daniel Aguilar's garage

27:08.539 --> 27:10.498
just came through.
You are good to go.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.110
Federal agents.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.417
Huh.All right.

27:16.460 --> 27:18.419
I see maps.

27:18.462 --> 27:21.248
And blueprints. Looks like
Dotson's Malibu house.

27:21.291 --> 27:22.684
Yeah, I got

27:22.728 --> 27:24.991
a rear motorcycle tire.
That's a 200/55.

27:25.034 --> 27:26.557
Well, that would
match the Ninja H2

27:26.601 --> 27:28.559
registered to Aguilar's ex-wife.

27:28.603 --> 27:30.431
Yes, it would. That's gas.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.781
Not a lot, but it
hasn't evaporated yet.

27:32.825 --> 27:36.611
That means he just left.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.613
Found his armory.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.180
At least two handguns
are missing.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.443
Which means he just left here
on his bike with two guns.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.532
Well, what are the odds

27:44.575 --> 27:47.187
that he's on his way
to take out his next target?

28:00.026 --> 28:01.505
So, we've reviewed the materials

28:01.549 --> 28:03.638
Kensi and Deeks recovered
from the storage garage,

28:03.682 --> 28:06.728
and the one consistent name
is David Whitaker.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.599
Does Whitaker fit the profile
of the other victims?

28:08.643 --> 28:11.733
Yeah, he moves cocaine in bulk,
so a very high-level player.

28:11.777 --> 28:13.343
So, where is he now?

28:13.387 --> 28:16.956
Unclear. We know he landed at
Van Nuys Airport flying private,

28:16.999 --> 28:18.261
was picked up by an SUV,

28:18.305 --> 28:19.741
but we're searching
for it now.
Mm-hmm.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.308
I was asked by LAPD
to detain Whitaker

28:21.351 --> 28:22.744
if the opportunity arises.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.224
They've got outstanding warrants
on him.

28:24.267 --> 28:26.574
Copy that.And, Agent Hamilton,

28:26.617 --> 28:28.141
thank you
for offering transparency

28:28.184 --> 28:29.751
and cooperation on this matter.

28:29.795 --> 28:32.014
Well, as much as this Marine
hates to admit it,

28:32.058 --> 28:34.147
you Navy people run
a tight operation.

28:35.235 --> 28:37.019
Hmm, must be my LAPD influence.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.629
Yeah. Not likely.

28:38.673 --> 28:39.935
NELL: Ooh. Whitaker's SUV
was just spotted

28:39.979 --> 28:42.242
rolling through Olympic
at La Brea.

28:42.285 --> 28:44.200
We'll head that way.
Let us know when it lands.

28:44.244 --> 28:45.811
You got it.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.122
Nell, we're parked
just off Fairfax.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.384
Let us know when you get eyes
on Whitaker.

28:54.428 --> 28:55.734
Just so I have
this straight,

28:55.777 --> 28:57.779
we're here searching
for an Army Ranger

28:57.823 --> 29:01.435
to make sure he doesn't kill
some dirtbag drug dealer?

29:01.478 --> 29:03.785
That's about right.LANCE: I've been sent
after criminals

29:03.829 --> 29:05.178
just like the ones
Aguilar's targeting.

29:05.221 --> 29:06.745
Only differences
were, they were

29:06.788 --> 29:08.659
in foreign countries and
I was given a commendation

29:08.703 --> 29:09.835
after I got 'em.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.619
Oh, this is so messed up.

29:11.662 --> 29:13.099
LANCE: Aguilar's off
serving his country

29:13.142 --> 29:15.971
and his kid gets killed
in his own home.

29:16.015 --> 29:17.799
The guy's lost.

29:17.843 --> 29:20.019
He's trying to kill as
many criminals as he can

29:20.062 --> 29:21.847
as fast as he can.

29:23.283 --> 29:27.243
Any one of us could go down
that rabbit hole.

29:27.287 --> 29:30.507
Well, hopefully, we can find
Daniel, get him some help.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.509
Some peace.

29:32.553 --> 29:35.121
Yeah.

29:35.164 --> 29:37.253
KENSI :
I got Whitaker's SUV.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.646
It's parked outside a
restaurant on Melrose.

29:38.689 --> 29:41.127
CALLEN: Head into the restaurant
as customers.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.476
You got Whitaker.
We're gonna move towards you,

29:42.519 --> 29:43.912
split up, we'll try
and locate Aguilar.

29:43.956 --> 29:44.826
Copy that.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.139
Hi, excuse me. Could we get
a table for two, please,

29:53.182 --> 29:54.793
preferably by the window?

29:54.836 --> 29:56.620
Do you have a reservation?Uh, no.

29:56.664 --> 29:57.926
You need a reservation.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.669
There's, like, four
free tables back there.

30:01.712 --> 30:02.801
Well, then, you should have
called yesterday

30:02.844 --> 30:04.237
and booked one of them.You know what?

30:04.280 --> 30:05.499
Why don't you take that
reservation book and just...

30:05.542 --> 30:08.023
Aah!
Okay, sorry about my sister.

30:08.067 --> 30:08.850
She's a little crazy.
I'm so sorry.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.199
Marty. What's your name?

30:10.243 --> 30:11.244
Alessandra.Alessandra, wow.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.898
Is that Italian for "princess"?

30:12.941 --> 30:14.160
That's a beautiful name.
And an accent.

30:14.203 --> 30:15.335
Where you from?
You from Greece?

30:15.378 --> 30:16.858
Italy?
Portland.

30:16.902 --> 30:17.859
: That's what I was
gonna guess next

30:17.903 --> 30:19.252
is Portland.
I love Portland.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.602
The land of trees
and food trucks and hipsters.

30:21.645 --> 30:23.212
Skinny jeans
and their man-buns.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.823
Listen, this is my fault,
and I'm sorry.

30:24.866 --> 30:26.302
I should have called ahead
and made a reservation,

30:26.346 --> 30:27.303
and I didn't.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.870
But it's a big day
for my sister.

30:28.914 --> 30:30.829
Just got her GED.
We're very proud of her.

30:30.872 --> 30:32.526
And, uh...

30:32.569 --> 30:34.093
so if there's any way
that we could get a table

30:34.136 --> 30:36.182
to celebrate
this monumental occasion,

30:36.225 --> 30:37.531
that would be amazing.

30:37.574 --> 30:39.794
Sure.

30:40.795 --> 30:42.275
For you.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.059
I'm so proud of you.

30:44.103 --> 30:46.018
Looks like the kid's
still got it.

30:46.061 --> 30:47.758
Still got it? Okay.ALESSANDRA:
Right this way.

30:47.802 --> 30:50.065
Yes, of course.
Right this way, thank you.

30:50.109 --> 30:52.676
You know what's
so crazy?
What's that?

30:52.720 --> 30:54.069
You look just like my dad.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.766
Oh, that's...

30:55.810 --> 30:57.029
CALLEN:
Aguilar could be anywhere.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.901
He might be trying to make
a long-range shot

30:59.945 --> 31:00.902
from one of these buildings.

31:00.946 --> 31:01.903
Nothing behind the restaurant.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.296
LANCE:
Me, too.

31:03.339 --> 31:04.819
I got nada.DEEKS :
Yeah, Whitaker,

31:04.863 --> 31:09.171
he's with, uh,
two bodyguards and a girlfriend.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.564
Looks like they're here
for the long haul.

31:10.607 --> 31:12.174
They just ordered two more
bottles of champagne.

31:12.218 --> 31:14.611
Hey, would you mind
taking a selfie with me?

31:14.655 --> 31:16.875
I just called my dad,
and he does not believe me.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.093
No, he doesn't mind
taking a selfie.

31:18.137 --> 31:19.921
Go ahead.

31:19.965 --> 31:20.922
Yeah, let's definitely
get in there and...

31:20.966 --> 31:22.358
That's a good angle.

31:22.402 --> 31:24.491
That's-- You should probably
put a filter on that.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.710
Thank you.Yeah, of course.
Thanks.

31:26.754 --> 31:28.321
When you got it,
you got it.Stop talking.

31:28.364 --> 31:30.192
SAM:
Guys, I have Aguilar.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.936
He's dressed as a delivery man,

31:34.980 --> 31:36.024
he's entering the back
of the restaurant.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.592
I'm two blocks out,
coming to you.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.636
One block out, moving in.

31:39.680 --> 31:43.031
I got Whitaker.And I got Aguilar.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.424
David Whitaker,
I'm a federal agent.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.599
You need to take cover.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.470
All right, let's go.

31:47.514 --> 31:48.863
Gun!

31:52.301 --> 31:53.694
All right.

31:53.737 --> 31:55.304
Kensi?

31:55.348 --> 31:57.567
Kens!On Aguilar.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.314
Sam!

32:06.663 --> 32:08.448
You gonna hit my lady
with a champagne...

32:08.491 --> 32:09.231
Deeks.
...bottle?

32:09.275 --> 32:11.886
You okay?

32:13.018 --> 32:14.541
Yeah.I think I broke my hand.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.820
I've got Aguilar.
Alley, east of the restaurant.

32:32.863 --> 32:35.562
Federal agent.
Drop your weapon, Aguilar.

32:35.605 --> 32:36.563
Drop your weapon.

32:36.606 --> 32:39.174
Come on, Aguilar.

32:39.218 --> 32:42.612
Set the gun down.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.745
SAM: Aguilar, there's a lot
of ways out of this.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.573
Nobody has to get hurt.

32:46.616 --> 32:49.054
Put the gun down.
We can help you.

32:49.097 --> 32:50.664
I don't see it that way, man.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.448
All this crime,

32:52.492 --> 32:54.798
right here at home,
it killed my son!

32:56.148 --> 32:57.714
The criminals I'm after

32:57.758 --> 33:01.849
are top of the food chain...
the ones that are above the law.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.156
Don't you get that, man?
I'm taking them out.

33:04.199 --> 33:05.722
LANCE:
I understand, brother.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.289
I do.

33:07.333 --> 33:10.075
SAM: Daniel, right now
there's no light.

33:10.118 --> 33:11.946
It's hard for you to find a way
out of the darkness

33:11.990 --> 33:13.034
inside your head.

33:13.078 --> 33:15.254
I know.
I've been there.

33:15.297 --> 33:17.038
I'm telling you,

33:17.082 --> 33:18.387
you can make yourself better.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.041
We can help you escape
this darkness, man.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.653
Just put the gun down,
let us help you. Please.

33:23.697 --> 33:25.873
Don't do it.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.055
Damn it!

33:34.099 --> 33:35.535
Nell, paramedic.

33:35.578 --> 33:37.058
SAM: We're okay.
You're gonna be just fine.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.582
You got this, Daniel.
You got this.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.848
Everything's gonna be just fine.

34:17.229 --> 34:18.882
This doesn't feel
like a win.

34:21.276 --> 34:23.278
With all the training
and experience Aguilar had,

34:23.322 --> 34:25.237
this was the only endgame.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.282
He wasn't gonna
die in jail.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.588
DEEKS:
Doesn't make it any easier.

34:29.632 --> 34:32.287
No, it doesn't.

34:37.031 --> 34:39.120
Do not beat yourself up.

34:39.164 --> 34:41.383
You didn't have a choice.

34:41.427 --> 34:44.212
His shot hit the wall behind me.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.909
He was eight inches off.

34:45.953 --> 34:48.999
He was an expert marksman
with the Rangers.

34:52.916 --> 34:53.787
He wasn't aiming for me.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.093
He wanted this over.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.618
This had nothing to do with you.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.537
You got your thing?

35:06.191 --> 35:07.540
Yeah.

35:07.583 --> 35:09.846
Get out of here.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.979
We got this.

35:36.177 --> 35:39.049
Casey...

35:39.093 --> 35:41.313
I'm so sorry.

35:44.098 --> 35:46.056
Listen, I'm sorry.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.798
I'm sorry.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.630
No, no, he's okay!I'm so sorry.

35:54.674 --> 35:57.111
I'm...
No, tell me he's okay!

35:58.068 --> 36:00.506
He's okay.
Tell me!

36:00.549 --> 36:01.507
I'm sorry.

36:01.550 --> 36:02.899
No!

36:15.651 --> 36:17.566
So, where is it you need to go?
I'll give you a ride.

36:17.610 --> 36:19.612
Well, I need to go to LAX.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.005
I want to go to a bar.

36:26.053 --> 36:28.925
What we did today...Listen, Sam,

36:28.969 --> 36:30.623
it's a complicated world, man.

36:32.842 --> 36:35.149
Aguilar chose to deal
with his loss

36:35.193 --> 36:37.195
with the only solution
that made sense to him.

36:40.067 --> 36:42.025
Some days I'm inches away
from that solution

36:42.069 --> 36:43.766
making sense to me.

36:43.810 --> 36:45.203
Just somedays?

36:50.947 --> 36:53.211
What, exactly, is it
that you do for Justice?

36:53.254 --> 36:56.475
I handle cases like these.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.955
Sensitive cases that
certain people don't want

36:58.999 --> 37:00.218
showing up in the news cycle.

37:00.261 --> 37:03.960
Hmm.
That's why I'm
a one-man band.

37:04.004 --> 37:06.659
Only way I can keep it
closed-loop.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.791
And it's national?

37:08.835 --> 37:11.098
No home base.

37:11.141 --> 37:12.186
Hmm, so you're either
running from something

37:12.230 --> 37:13.187
or hiding from something.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.493
I don't hide, brother.

37:14.536 --> 37:16.277
Me either.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.018
Guess I'm running
from the fact

37:18.061 --> 37:20.412
that I don't have a home
since my wife passed away.

37:20.455 --> 37:23.893
We moved from base to base.
Some of the accommodations...

37:23.937 --> 37:26.809
they were not the best.

37:26.853 --> 37:29.029
I've stayed in those places.

37:29.072 --> 37:33.947
Jessica could turn a ten-by-ten
shack into our home.

37:39.648 --> 37:40.693
I'm sorry.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.959
Listen, Sam.
Yeah.

37:46.002 --> 37:48.266
I know you got a great thing
going on here in L.A.,

37:48.309 --> 37:50.703
but if it ever becomes
too small of a pond,

37:50.746 --> 37:53.532
if you ever got your own demons
that need running from,

37:53.575 --> 37:57.362
I'd be honored if you came
and partnered up with me.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.725
Let's get a drink.Let's do it.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.910
JUDGE:
Will the defendant please rise?

38:27.696 --> 38:31.004
Anna Kolcheck, the purpose of
this hearing is to sentence you

38:31.047 --> 38:33.093
for the killing
of Abram Sokolov.

38:33.136 --> 38:34.137
Is there anything
you would like to say

38:34.181 --> 38:36.183
to this court before I rule?

38:38.011 --> 38:40.448
No, Your Honor.

38:42.015 --> 38:44.147
Very well.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.193
According to federal guidelines,

38:46.236 --> 38:48.151
the sentence
for voluntary manslaughter

38:48.195 --> 38:50.197
should not exceed 15 years.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.242
But because
of your exemplary service

38:52.286 --> 38:54.636
as a former Chicago
Police Department detective,

38:54.680 --> 38:57.378
your letters of commendation
from NCIS,

38:57.422 --> 39:00.294
and your service
as an ATF agent,

39:00.338 --> 39:03.036
I sentence you to seven years,

39:03.079 --> 39:06.996
with the possibility of parole
after three years served.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.041
This court is adjourned.
