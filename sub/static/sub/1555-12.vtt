12:27.377 --> 12:29.309
were a male and female
in ski masks.

12:29.311 --> 12:31.011
NYPD's well aware
of the connection.

12:31.013 --> 12:33.647
We have a few leads
and several persons of interest

12:33.649 --> 12:35.015
we're following up on.

12:35.017 --> 12:36.850
No further comment at this time.
Excuse me.

12:36.852 --> 12:39.787
Nice work there.
Anyone you know?

12:39.789 --> 12:41.755
Nobody that brazen.

12:41.757 --> 12:45.525
Whoever it is, they're
definitely on the warpath.

It's the secure line
to Research.

13:23.229 --> 13:25.931
This is Research.
We're amending your orders.

13:25.933 --> 13:28.233
Our orders originated
with Control.

13:28.235 --> 13:31.103
<i>This is Control.</i>

13:32.205 --> 13:33.839
Pleasure to meet you.

13:33.841 --> 13:35.640
It's not mutual.

13:35.642 --> 13:37.776
I know about New York,
Agent Grice.

13:37.778 --> 13:40.144

Relax.
I'm letting you live.

<i>Here are your amended orders.</i>
<i>Do not kill Yasin Said</i>

13:52.392 --> 13:55.393

his laptop hard drive.

13:55.395 --> 13:58.062
The hard drive is the priority.

13:58.064 --> 13:59.330
Understood.

13:59.332 --> 14:02.733
And Grice,
you report only to me.

Consider this your reprieve.

This must be your
dream come true, Grice...

14:36.135 --> 14:39.503
investigating someone before
we put a bullet in their head.

14:39.505 --> 14:43.072
Yeah, just like the old days.

14:43.074 --> 14:44.974
I've never been happier.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.312
Get ready.
He's about to go off the grid.

14:52.819 --> 14:53.515

I just want to see your laptop.

My laptop?

16:02.651 --> 16:05.785
Okay.

16:05.787 --> 16:09.389
I'll do anything you say,
just please don't shoot.

16:09.391 --> 16:11.258
Please be careful,
it's fragile.

Wait.
Something's wrong.

16:59.072 --> 17:01.373
Whoa!
It's melting.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.841

17:02.843 --> 17:05.010
I mean the computer is melting.

We're about to lose our guy.
I need an answer now.

17:10.384 --> 17:12.584
Just lost the laptop.
Brooks, stand down.

I repeat...

17:14.354 --> 17:16.887
stand... down!

17:16.890 --> 17:20.358
We need to find out
what was in that laptop.

Some kind of a self-destruct
mechanism

18:03.421 --> 18:04.653
that I've never seen before.

18:04.655 --> 18:06.588
Can you reconstruct the data?

18:06.590 --> 18:08.257
This isn't a computer anymore.

18:36.253 --> 18:39.888
Reassigned?
By whom?

18:47.963 --> 18:51.366
You think you can interfere
with my operations?

18:51.368 --> 18:54.334
Of course not.
You do your job, I do mine.

18:54.336 --> 18:55.703
Oh?

18:55.705 --> 18:57.705
Does your job include
spying on me?

18:57.707 --> 18:59.507
Little paranoid there.

Do I need to brief
the president

19:19.528 --> 19:22.129
about this terrorist
on the loose?

19:22.131 --> 19:23.696
Who told you that?

19:23.698 --> 19:25.565
Who told you you were allowed
to keep secrets from me?

19:25.567 --> 19:27.800
We're having a bad enough day.

19:27.802 --> 19:29.201
If there's a problem
in Detroit,

19:29.203 --> 19:31.804
the White House has to get
out in front of it.

19:31.806 --> 19:33.940
There is a problem in Detroit,

19:33.942 --> 19:35.374
and no one is ever gonna
hear about it.

19:35.376 --> 19:38.244
Yeah, I hope not,
for your sake.

19:38.246 --> 19:40.647
Do you even know
how many problems

19:40.649 --> 19:45.717
I have solved for you, Mike?
853.

19:45.719 --> 19:49.054
All enemy combatants,
many on American soil,

19:49.056 --> 19:54.426
identified by Research,
and handled by me.

19:54.428 --> 19:58.830
And by "handled," you realize
I mean killed, right?

19:58.832 --> 20:00.331
There's no need
for this kind of talk.

20:00.333 --> 20:04.102
Of killing?
But it's the truth, Mike.

20:04.104 --> 20:08.339
853 threats
to national security

20:08.341 --> 20:12.144

If you can sleep with that,
then good for you.

20:14.782 --> 20:17.081
If you can't, too bad.

No offense, I asked
for my personal detail,

20:37.236 --> 20:39.136
my regular guys.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.138
Ma'am, they were southbound
on the beltway 90 minutes ago

20:41.140 --> 20:43.640
when their vehicle was t-boned
by a Mack truck.

20:43.642 --> 20:46.711
T-boned?
How bad?

20:46.713 --> 20:48.012
They survived.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.813
Occupants of the truck
fled the scene,

20:49.815 --> 20:52.849
a man and a woman
wearing ski masks.

20:52.851 --> 20:56.019
The same two that were raising
hell in New York all morning?

20:56.021 --> 20:57.954
State police are investigating,

20:57.956 --> 21:00.957
but ma'am,
their phones were stolen.

21:00.959 --> 21:02.859
Your mission
may be compromised.

21:02.861 --> 21:06.562
I'm gonna put a team on it
and we'll find out who did this.

21:06.564 --> 21:08.898
You men and I are going
out into the field.

It's now or never.

[train horn blows]

22:07.290 --> 22:08.222
Go.

22:13.095 --> 22:15.763
Contact the station master
and stop that train.

22:22.871 --> 22:24.638
Remember, it's capture,
not kill.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.974
I need to interrogate
this target first.

22:34.716 --> 22:35.816
What the hell?

22:39.421 --> 22:40.854
Evasive maneuver!

23:19.158 --> 23:21.292
I hope you liked our rocket.

23:21.294 --> 23:24.028
We were saving it
for a special occasion.

23:27.532 --> 23:29.767
Where is Shaw?

23:51.930 --> 23:54.265
[coughs]

23:58.469 --> 24:02.038
[sighs]
Memories.

24:14.018 --> 24:15.451
Where is she?

24:15.453 --> 24:19.022
Agent Shaw?

24:19.024 --> 24:21.257
Why, something happen to her?

24:26.397 --> 24:28.298
Shaw's cover identity
was burned

24:28.300 --> 24:30.800
eight days after
one of your ISA operatives,

24:30.802 --> 24:33.302
guy named Grice,
saw her in the field.

24:33.304 --> 24:35.304
The ISA is working
with Samaritan,

24:35.306 --> 24:37.072
and Samaritan has Shaw.

24:38.909 --> 24:40.643
It's got nothing to do with me.

24:40.645 --> 24:43.045
Well, the evidence tells
a different story.

24:43.047 --> 24:45.480
We tracked down
four Samaritan agents

24:45.482 --> 24:47.983
who were at the stock exchange.

24:47.985 --> 24:51.153
According to their vehicle GPS,
they've been spending

24:51.155 --> 24:55.890
a lot of time outside your house
in Georgetown.

24:55.892 --> 24:57.326
What are you talking about?

24:57.328 --> 24:59.995
Samaritan knows where Shaw is,

24:59.997 --> 25:02.263
and therefore, so do you.

25:02.265 --> 25:04.432
Hmph.

25:04.434 --> 25:07.602
Either you talk to me now,
or I'm gonna invite Root in here

25:07.604 --> 25:10.338
to re-create the events
of your last conversation.

25:11.874 --> 25:15.777
Good cop, bad cop?
Really?

25:15.779 --> 25:18.545
There are no good cops here.

25:18.547 --> 25:21.048
Did you happen to see
the terrorist

25:21.050 --> 25:23.851
I was chasing
on that freight train?

25:23.853 --> 25:27.421
His name's Yasin Said.

25:27.423 --> 25:29.723
He's planning to attack
a major American city,

25:29.725 --> 25:32.593
and he was 60 seconds
away from capture

25:32.595 --> 25:36.029
before you shot me
with that shoulder cannon.

25:36.031 --> 25:38.632
Now, he's loose.

25:38.634 --> 25:40.534
That's on you.

25:47.441 --> 25:49.910
Where is Shaw?

25:52.613 --> 25:56.049
I don't know.

26:03.424 --> 26:07.093
I'm almost glad you said that.

26:09.736 --> 26:21.972
_

26:22.743 --> 26:24.109
Hello, old friend.

26:26.179 --> 26:28.280
Let's not get carried away.

26:28.282 --> 26:33.118
I'm sorry, can you repeat that?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.921
I'm deaf in this ear.

26:37.657 --> 26:39.724
Feel free to return the favor.

26:43.095 --> 26:46.031
But it won't get you
any closer to finding Shaw.

26:46.033 --> 26:48.633
Can't return the favor.

26:48.635 --> 26:50.835
No scalpel.

26:50.837 --> 26:54.505
Besides, I'm not the monster
I used to be.

26:54.507 --> 26:55.740
I've changed.

26:57.842 --> 27:02.046
Well, mostly changed.

27:05.384 --> 27:08.586
Shaw used to work for you
till you tried to kill her.

27:08.588 --> 27:13.124
You probably remember she has
an Axis II personality disorder,

27:13.126 --> 27:16.393
which means technically,
she's a sociopath,

27:16.395 --> 27:18.796
incapable of caring for others.

27:18.798 --> 27:23.400
But the thing about Shaw is,
she does care,

27:23.402 --> 27:26.403
enough to save my life.

27:26.405 --> 27:30.407
So today, I'm saving hers,
and you're gonna help,

27:30.409 --> 27:32.909
even if you care about no one,

27:32.911 --> 27:35.479
not even your daughter Julia.

27:35.481 --> 27:39.249
[winces]

27:39.251 --> 27:42.252

27:42.254 --> 27:44.687

[sucks in air]

27:44.689 --> 27:45.688
Oh.

27:47.390 --> 27:50.693
Such a sweet girl.

27:50.695 --> 27:53.096
She deserves a better mother.

27:57.735 --> 28:01.237
How old were you
when your mom died?

28:01.239 --> 28:04.706
- I was nine.
- Nine, right,

28:04.708 --> 28:08.777
and you started spending a lot
of time in the nurse's office.

28:08.779 --> 28:12.181
All that anger,
all that stress.

28:12.183 --> 28:14.650
That's when the high
blood pressure started, right?

28:14.652 --> 28:18.587
You grew up motherless...

28:18.589 --> 28:20.656
and you suffered for it.

28:22.925 --> 28:26.128
Well...

28:26.130 --> 28:28.930
at least Julia has a mother.

28:28.932 --> 28:32.233
Because even a mom
who kills people for a living
